1
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:14,667
Yes, let's go check if he's okay. . 
Come on. .

2
00:02:21,999 --> 00:02:22,818
Hello.

3
00:02:23,514 --> 00:02:25,357
Sir, your job is done.

4
00:02:33,631 --> 00:02:36,867
Hello. - Doctor,
the operation was successful.

5
00:02:37,768 --> 00:02:39,407
The patient is dead!
- Fine.

6
00:02:43,585 --> 00:02:45,469
Hello.
- Advocate.

7
00:02:46,042 --> 00:02:49,442
I have sent your client
to his heavenly abode.

8
00:02:54,685 --> 00:02:56,037
Hello.
- Khanna.

9
00:02:58,044 --> 00:03:01,607
I killed that bastard,
Rakabh Singh. .

10
00:03:03,655 --> 00:03:04,475
You!

11
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:07,342
Hello.
Hello!

12
00:03:07,752 --> 00:03:08,612
Hello.

13
00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:12,462
Hello.
Hello. .

14
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:15,739
Hello.
Hello. .

15
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:17,746
Hello. .

16
00:03:18,033 --> 00:03:21,022
Hello. .

17
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,682
Goddess Lakshmi,
the owl is Your mount.

18
00:05:25,133 --> 00:05:27,673
And You even love
Your idiotic devotees a lot.

19
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,703
Then why don't You knock
some sense into my stupid son?

20
00:05:31,236 --> 00:05:34,021
That jackass

21
00:05:34,103 --> 00:05:37,339
has his nose in a book
from dawn to dusk.

22
00:05:37,913 --> 00:05:39,838
Knock some sense
into that son of a dog, Goddess.

23
00:05:40,248 --> 00:05:42,582
Sir, why are you cursing yourself?

24
00:05:43,729 --> 00:05:47,129
Dhaniram, today is your lucky day.

25
00:05:47,825 --> 00:05:50,692
Today, I am in a mood
to give something to someone.

26
00:05:50,979 --> 00:05:53,887
Wow!
Wonderful, sir!

27
00:05:54,256 --> 00:05:57,123
I've never come across
a philanthropist like you.

28
00:05:57,205 --> 00:05:58,024
You haven't seen one, right?

29
00:05:58,106 --> 00:05:59,867
Stop looking at me
and check the accounts.

30
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,226
What was I saying, Goddess?

31
00:06:03,349 --> 00:06:05,356
You were saying that you
are the father of a jackass.

32
00:06:05,561 --> 00:06:06,421
Right.

33
00:06:06,831 --> 00:06:10,108
So, Goddess,
please enlighten my son.

34
00:06:10,681 --> 00:06:12,319
Stop him from being a bookworm

35
00:06:12,647 --> 00:06:14,531
and make him develop
an interest in girls

36
00:06:15,228 --> 00:06:17,194
so that he beguiles and marries
the daughter of a rich man

37
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:19,856
who will bring a lot of dowry.

38
00:06:20,225 --> 00:06:22,642
That way, I can lead
a comfortable life in my old age.

39
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:25,345
Sir, taking dowry is an offence!

40
00:06:25,714 --> 00:06:28,212
I think you have got
a job somewhere else.

41
00:06:29,605 --> 00:06:31,079
Had that been the case,
why would I have been in this hell?

42
00:06:31,243 --> 00:06:33,455
Then find a job for yourself
because I fire you.

43
00:06:33,537 --> 00:06:35,708
Come on, get lost.
- But what is my fault, sir?

44
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:36,691
What did you just say?

45
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:38,288
That taking dowry
is an offence. . - No. .

46
00:06:38,329 --> 00:06:40,787
I said
taking dowry is not an offence.

47
00:06:40,828 --> 00:06:42,794
It is not an offence.
It is not an offence!

48
00:06:43,122 --> 00:06:43,941
Dad.

49
00:06:51,969 --> 00:06:54,222
See you. - Where are you going
so early in the morning?

50
00:06:54,345 --> 00:06:55,738
College.
- Goodness!

51
00:06:56,311 --> 00:06:57,171
Going there is of no use.

52
00:06:57,663 --> 00:06:59,916
Go someplace
where girls hang out.

53
00:07:00,202 --> 00:07:01,963
Go to the lovers' lane.

54
00:07:02,087 --> 00:07:04,913
Find a girl for yourself, dear!

55
00:07:05,118 --> 00:07:06,756
God knows
what you keep talking about!

56
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:08,190
I really don't get it.

57
00:07:08,312 --> 00:07:11,180
I too didn't get it
when I was your age.

58
00:07:11,426 --> 00:07:13,146
Later, my dad
explained everything to me.

59
00:07:13,228 --> 00:07:14,948
And he got it.
- Correct! - Yes!

60
00:07:15,522 --> 00:07:18,430
Listen, get me a daughter-in-law
as soon as possible.

61
00:07:18,594 --> 00:07:20,519
Make sure she's from a rich family!
- So, you are telling me

62
00:07:20,887 --> 00:07:23,345
to cheat a girl
for the sake of money!

63
00:07:23,427 --> 00:07:28,301
If she is rich, cheat her parents,
siblings. . Everyone.

64
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:30,104
I will never do that.

65
00:07:30,185 --> 00:07:31,005
What!

66
00:07:31,455 --> 00:07:32,889
Not only you
but also your dad will do it!

67
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:33,954
Then do it.

68
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:36,043
Who is stopping you?
- Dhaniram!

69
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:38,132
Mistake. . I made a mistake.
I am naive.

70
00:07:38,213 --> 00:07:39,115
Suraj!

71
00:07:39,852 --> 00:07:40,958
Suraj. . 
- Sir. .

72
00:07:40,999 --> 00:07:42,064
Sir. .

73
00:07:44,317 --> 00:07:45,136
Oh, God!

74
00:07:45,627 --> 00:07:48,904
Oh, God!
Knock some sense into my son!

75
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,181
Sir, I think
he is not your own son.

76
00:07:53,615 --> 00:07:55,171
Come closer.
- Here you go.

77
00:08:20,157 --> 00:08:21,550
Hi!
- Hi! - Hi!

78
00:08:24,417 --> 00:08:26,014
Wow!
Her walk is so sexy.

79
00:08:26,096 --> 00:08:28,349
She is also very rich, pal.

80
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:30,889
The guy she marries
will be very lucky.

81
00:08:30,971 --> 00:08:34,166
If she marries me,
my dad will go insane with joy.

82
00:08:34,944 --> 00:08:37,811
Your dad can go mad for all I care.

83
00:08:38,344 --> 00:08:40,269
She will get married
only to my son.

84
00:08:40,433 --> 00:08:41,293
Get to it!

85
00:08:41,579 --> 00:08:43,791
Hey, where is he? Where is he?
- Who. . Hey!

86
00:08:43,873 --> 00:08:45,266
Sir. . 
- Where is he? - Sir!

87
00:08:45,758 --> 00:08:47,355
Sir. . 
- Where is he? - Sir. .

88
00:08:47,437 --> 00:08:48,543
Sir. . 
- Where is he? - Sir!

89
00:08:48,707 --> 00:08:49,690
Sir. . 
- Where did he go?

90
00:08:49,812 --> 00:08:52,475
Sir. . 
- Where. . - Sir. .

91
00:08:52,557 --> 00:08:55,424
Sir, please tell me
which dog has bitten you

92
00:08:55,506 --> 00:08:57,554
that you are running around
in circles like a dog

93
00:08:57,677 --> 00:08:58,783
and trying to catch your own tail.

94
00:08:58,824 --> 00:09:01,159
I found a girl!
- You found a girl!

95
00:09:01,445 --> 00:09:03,371
I found a girl!
- Unbelievable!

96
00:09:03,657 --> 00:09:06,484
Sir, what will you do
with a girl at this age?

97
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,040
What!

98
00:09:08,572 --> 00:09:11,850
Dhaniram, at times,
you make fun of me.

99
00:09:12,013 --> 00:09:14,102
Isn't it?
Isn't it?

100
00:09:14,348 --> 00:09:17,748
I have found someone
to brighten up my son's future.

101
00:09:19,673 --> 00:09:22,376
Sir. - Yes? - Seems like
you've lost your mind.

102
00:09:23,155 --> 00:09:24,301
Ask me why.
Ask me.

103
00:09:24,711 --> 00:09:25,612
Mr. Dhaniram.

104
00:09:25,858 --> 00:09:27,046
Why?
- Listen.

105
00:09:27,742 --> 00:09:31,224
Sir, your son is brilliant.

106
00:09:31,633 --> 00:09:33,190
Why would he need someone
to brighten up his future?

107
00:09:33,886 --> 00:09:34,746
Dhaniram.
- Yes?

108
00:09:34,828 --> 00:09:36,057
Come closer.
- Here you go.

109
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,040
Closer.
- Okay.

110
00:09:38,146 --> 00:09:40,481
Now, ask me why I slapped you.

111
00:09:40,686 --> 00:09:41,997
Ask me.
- You are my boss.

112
00:09:42,406 --> 00:09:43,635
You can slap me without a reason.

113
00:09:43,758 --> 00:09:45,314
No, that's not true.

114
00:09:45,765 --> 00:09:48,345
Until your boss
completes his sentence

115
00:09:48,509 --> 00:09:50,106
there is no need to interrupt him.

116
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:51,417
Got it?
- Yes, sir.

117
00:09:51,868 --> 00:09:57,152
I have found a rich girl
for my Suraj!

118
00:09:57,561 --> 00:09:59,528
Hi, Dad.
- There you go.

119
00:09:59,609 --> 00:10:01,780
My son, Suraj,
has come at the right time.

120
00:10:01,862 --> 00:10:02,722
Listen, Suraj.

121
00:10:02,804 --> 00:10:05,467
Tomorrow, when your college
gets over at 4 o'clock

122
00:10:06,286 --> 00:10:09,317
Shakuntala Devi's daughter
will leave in her car. .

123
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:12,471
She will leave for her house
in her car.

124
00:10:13,003 --> 00:10:15,338
When she is passing
through a deserted street

125
00:10:15,543 --> 00:10:16,403
two goons. .

126
00:10:16,731 --> 00:10:18,533
Two goons will come there
and waylay her.

127
00:10:18,697 --> 00:10:20,622
They will try to molest her.

128
00:10:20,909 --> 00:10:21,974
Then you have to show up there.

129
00:10:22,301 --> 00:10:23,858
Then by using martial arts,
which you have learnt. .

130
00:10:24,145 --> 00:10:25,496
You will use martial arts
to save her.

131
00:10:26,316 --> 00:10:28,077
Then that girl will say

132
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:29,715
'I love you'.

133
00:10:30,084 --> 00:10:32,378
'I love you. '

134
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:34,999
Then you will get the girl

135
00:10:35,122 --> 00:10:37,948
and both you and I
will get her property!

136
00:10:38,317 --> 00:10:39,177
So, how is the idea?

137
00:10:39,709 --> 00:10:40,529
Where did he go?

138
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:41,799
Suraj!
- He will come back.

139
00:10:42,659 --> 00:10:45,362
But there's a problem
with your plan.

140
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:46,263
What's the problem?

141
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:48,885
Actually, you will have to pay
the goons.

142
00:10:50,646 --> 00:10:52,858
I had completely forgotten that,
Mr. Dhaniram. - Correct.

143
00:10:54,579 --> 00:10:55,971
Here's what you need to do.
- What?

144
00:10:56,299 --> 00:10:57,651
I will disguise myself as Billa

145
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,002
and you need to disguise yourself
as Ranga.

146
00:11:14,772 --> 00:11:16,984
Excuse me!
Excuse me!

147
00:11:17,025 --> 00:11:17,967
What happened to you people?

148
00:11:22,923 --> 00:11:25,217
Nothing has happened to us,
sweetheart!

149
00:11:25,872 --> 00:11:28,289
You are the one
who's going to suffer now!

150
00:11:32,016 --> 00:11:33,450
Hey!
What nonsense!

151
00:11:33,532 --> 00:11:35,006
Get out of my way!
- What!

152
00:11:37,054 --> 00:11:38,488
Hey, girl!

153
00:11:38,938 --> 00:11:41,191
We have come to molest you.

154
00:11:41,314 --> 00:11:42,502
Hey!
- What happened?

155
00:11:43,076 --> 00:11:44,591
She is going to be Suraj's wife.

156
00:11:44,714 --> 00:11:46,721
Mind your tongue.
- Is that so?

157
00:11:47,049 --> 00:11:47,950
Come on.

158
00:11:49,179 --> 00:11:50,326
My Lady.

159
00:11:50,981 --> 00:11:53,684
Can we molest you, please?
- What!

160
00:11:55,937 --> 00:11:59,910
You slapped my friend!

161
00:12:00,566 --> 00:12:03,433
I won't spare you!

162
00:12:09,987 --> 00:12:12,240
Looks like the hero
of our drama has arrived.

163
00:12:13,714 --> 00:12:16,663
I will let you go
only if he comes to your rescue

164
00:12:16,909 --> 00:12:18,424
my sweetheart!

165
00:12:26,944 --> 00:12:27,804
Rascal!
- What. .

166
00:12:28,091 --> 00:12:29,934
You dare hit your father so hard!

167
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:31,860
What. .

168
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:36,734
This is someone else.

169
00:12:36,898 --> 00:12:40,297
Sir. . - Yes?
- He is the villain, not the hero.

170
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,485
He is good-for-nothing.

171
00:12:45,868 --> 00:12:47,711
Hey. . 
- Okay, go ahead.

172
00:13:00,204 --> 00:13:01,597
My back!

173
00:13:10,199 --> 00:13:11,345
Get up, rascals!

174
00:13:13,189 --> 00:13:14,745
Why are you running away?
Come here, champions.

175
00:13:14,909 --> 00:13:15,810
Dhaniram. . 
- Yes?

176
00:13:16,097 --> 00:13:18,800
Y-You get beaten up.
I shall increase your salary.

177
00:13:19,169 --> 00:13:20,890
No! - Go. . 
- I don't want your money!

178
00:13:21,135 --> 00:13:22,528
You get beaten up!
- Hey. .

179
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:23,470
Hold him!

180
00:13:24,002 --> 00:13:24,904
Hey!

181
00:13:26,132 --> 00:13:29,204
Hip-hip hurray. .

182
00:13:29,327 --> 00:13:30,310
You two hit me!

183
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:31,621
He. . 
He hit you.

184
00:13:31,703 --> 00:13:32,972
You rascal!

185
00:13:36,741 --> 00:13:38,994
Let's go. Run!
- Run!

186
00:13:39,035 --> 00:13:40,059
Where do you think you're going?

187
00:13:40,141 --> 00:13:41,615
Hey. . 
Leave my lungi.

188
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:42,885
Leave my lungi. . 
My lungi!

189
00:13:43,008 --> 00:13:44,319
Leave my lungi!
- What the. .

190
00:13:44,483 --> 00:13:45,957
When did you buy
a pair of new underwear?

191
00:13:45,998 --> 00:13:46,858
Hey, rascal!

192
00:13:47,063 --> 00:13:48,087
Lungi!

193
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:51,774
Get lost!

194
00:13:53,002 --> 00:13:55,624
Sir! Sir!
I am over here, sir!

195
00:13:55,665 --> 00:13:56,812
Come on, sir!

196
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:13,319
Thanks.
Thank you very much.

197
00:14:13,851 --> 00:14:16,186
If you hadn't come on time. . 
- It's okay.

198
00:14:16,432 --> 00:14:17,333
I'll drop you home.

199
00:14:18,398 --> 00:14:19,217
Okay.

200
00:14:24,624 --> 00:14:25,484
What's the matter?

201
00:14:25,525 --> 00:14:26,754
Why is Tinku crying?

202
00:14:27,368 --> 00:14:32,570
Ma'am, Mr. Chunnu bit Tinku.
- What!

203
00:14:32,652 --> 00:14:34,536
What's so shocking about it?

204
00:14:34,823 --> 00:14:37,076
Do you remember
when Tinku had bitten me?

205
00:14:37,445 --> 00:14:39,861
I had to get 14 injections
administered in my abdomen!

206
00:14:40,025 --> 00:14:41,377
I still have the marks!
Should I show it to you?

207
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,524
That's enough, Chunnu.

208
00:14:42,892 --> 00:14:44,612
You are such a fool!

209
00:14:45,514 --> 00:14:47,439
I am your brother's son after all.

210
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,937
It's a family problem.
- Shut up.

211
00:14:50,265 --> 00:14:51,207
Oh, God!

212
00:14:51,658 --> 00:14:53,255
When will I be rid of this problem?

213
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:56,163
It will take time.
And I am not in a hurry.

214
00:14:56,245 --> 00:14:57,065
Mom!

215
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:59,235
Hey. . - Mom, do you know
what happened today?

216
00:14:59,686 --> 00:15:00,915
I was returning from college

217
00:15:00,997 --> 00:15:02,717
when two goons waylaid me!

218
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:05,011
But Mr. Sikander reached there

219
00:15:05,175 --> 00:15:06,895
and chased the goons away
after thrashing them!

220
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:08,902
Hey!
Why did you stop there?

221
00:15:09,189 --> 00:15:10,008
Please come in.

222
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:11,442
How can he come inside?

223
00:15:11,933 --> 00:15:13,326
I will interrogate him first.

224
00:15:13,572 --> 00:15:14,596
Which family he belongs to

225
00:15:14,801 --> 00:15:15,825
who he is related to

226
00:15:16,029 --> 00:15:17,053
what his breed is. .

227
00:15:17,258 --> 00:15:19,716
By the way,
AIDS is on the rise these days.

228
00:15:19,798 --> 00:15:21,969
Brother Chunnu!
He is my friend.

229
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:23,689
Oh, come on.
How is this possible?

230
00:15:23,812 --> 00:15:25,819
You met him today
and you two have become friends!

231
00:15:26,556 --> 00:15:29,710
Your mother and I
have been here for 25 years now

232
00:15:30,038 --> 00:15:31,676
but we haven't befriended
each other yet.

233
00:15:32,495 --> 00:15:33,970
Chunnu, go upstairs.

234
00:15:34,011 --> 00:15:35,936
I don't plan on going anywhere.

235
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:37,821
You can go if you wish.
- Chunnu!

236
00:15:40,974 --> 00:15:42,080
Looks like he's crazy.

237
00:15:42,121 --> 00:15:46,053
Brother Chunnu is mentally. . 
- I-It's okay.

238
00:15:47,037 --> 00:15:48,142
Please come inside.

239
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:52,607
Mom, this is Mr. Sikander.

240
00:15:53,058 --> 00:15:53,877
Greetings.

241
00:15:54,942 --> 00:15:56,990
I owe you, big time.

242
00:15:57,318 --> 00:15:58,915
Ma'am, I did it
because I'm a good Samaritan. .

243
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:01,045
Ramu!
- Yes, ma'am?

244
00:16:01,373 --> 00:16:03,052
Make some tea for us, quickly.
- Sure.

245
00:16:03,544 --> 00:16:05,714
And tell Dinu to water the plants.

246
00:16:05,837 --> 00:16:07,394
He left for his village
this morning.

247
00:16:07,762 --> 00:16:09,892
He left for his village?
Who will do the chores then?

248
00:16:10,589 --> 00:16:11,695
I will do it, ma'am.

249
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:14,357
Dinu has sent me
as his replacement.

250
00:16:15,135 --> 00:16:16,201
What's your name?

251
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:17,716
Raghu.
- All right.

252
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,321
Ma'am, I'd like to take
your leave now

253
00:16:21,771 --> 00:16:23,082
otherwise my dad will be worried.

254
00:16:23,491 --> 00:16:25,293
Your father loves you very much.

255
00:16:25,498 --> 00:16:26,563
I am his only son.

256
00:16:27,341 --> 00:16:29,103
I am the sole heir to the property
that's worth crores of rupees.

257
00:16:29,717 --> 00:16:31,192
Goodbye!

258
00:16:33,936 --> 00:16:35,165
He is a good boy.

259
00:16:36,435 --> 00:16:38,483
Things did not turn out the way
I thought they would!

260
00:16:38,524 --> 00:16:40,121
I am done for!

261
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:43,275
Let him come back!

262
00:16:44,217 --> 00:16:45,897
I will teach him such a lesson. .

263
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:48,682
First, you must learn a lesson.

264
00:16:48,764 --> 00:16:51,263
That you will never go after money.

265
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:55,195
Why shouldn't I?

266
00:16:55,236 --> 00:16:57,079
Great!
He got beaten black and blue

267
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,308
yet he hasn't learnt his lesson.

268
00:16:58,635 --> 00:17:01,134
Had Suraj come there on time. . 
- Yes?

269
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:04,616
... we would have welcomed the girl
along with her property.

270
00:17:04,697 --> 00:17:06,213
Yes. . 
- It's okay.

271
00:17:06,295 --> 00:17:07,647
I will try again.

272
00:17:07,852 --> 00:17:10,391
You can go alone.
I won't accompany you. - Why?

273
00:17:10,719 --> 00:17:11,948
Don't you get your salary from me?

274
00:17:12,152 --> 00:17:14,036
I don't get paid
for getting beaten up.

275
00:17:15,388 --> 00:17:17,313
Looks like Suraj is here.

276
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:21,819
Where are my shoes?
My shoes.

277
00:17:22,106 --> 00:17:23,212
Shoes?
- Yes.

278
00:17:23,253 --> 00:17:25,178
You left your shoes on the street.

279
00:17:27,226 --> 00:17:29,274
What happened?

280
00:17:30,462 --> 00:17:33,903
I have suffered a loss of Rs. 47!
- Oh, dear. .

281
00:17:34,148 --> 00:17:35,172
Hi, Dad!
- What. .

282
00:17:38,408 --> 00:17:39,432
What happened to you?

283
00:17:42,709 --> 00:17:45,289
Dhaniram, look at him.
He's acting all innocent! - Yes. .

284
00:17:45,945 --> 00:17:49,099
I had asked you
to be there at 4 p. m. !

285
00:17:49,508 --> 00:17:50,942
You didn't reach there.

286
00:17:50,983 --> 00:17:52,048
Someone else showed up.

287
00:17:52,089 --> 00:17:55,038
And he thrashed sir so much

288
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,946
that he's in terrible shape!
- Shut up!

289
00:17:58,315 --> 00:18:00,404
Why are you rubbing salt
into my wound?

290
00:18:00,568 --> 00:18:02,411
Sir, we are out of salt.

291
00:18:02,944 --> 00:18:05,155
For the last four days, I've been
having Dal which has no salt in it.

292
00:18:05,196 --> 00:18:07,777
Shut up! First, tell me.
Where were you?

293
00:18:08,063 --> 00:18:09,210
I had got a flat tyre.

294
00:18:09,251 --> 00:18:11,258
God. . 
My back!

295
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:13,266
Listen. . 
Listen, lie down.

296
00:18:13,388 --> 00:18:14,904
I'll get some turmeric milk
for you.

297
00:18:15,231 --> 00:18:16,296
You will feel better
as soon as you drink it.

298
00:18:18,877 --> 00:18:20,147
If I knew

299
00:18:20,188 --> 00:18:22,277
that I would get some milk
after getting beaten up

300
00:18:22,604 --> 00:18:24,325
I would have let that guy
thrash me a little more.

301
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,110
Dhaniram.
- Yes?

302
00:18:27,151 --> 00:18:28,871
Come closer.
- Here I am.

303
00:18:32,189 --> 00:18:33,336
Hi, Dad!

304
00:18:34,524 --> 00:18:35,794
Idiot!
- What the. .

305
00:18:36,244 --> 00:18:37,678
Did you get beaten up?

306
00:18:37,719 --> 00:18:38,866
I am not like you

307
00:18:38,907 --> 00:18:41,037
that I'll get thrashed
for no reason. - What!

308
00:18:41,446 --> 00:18:44,313
I fought a few goons
and also impressed a girl.

309
00:18:44,477 --> 00:18:45,542
Idiot!

310
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:47,304
I never taught you anything

311
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:49,474
other than caring for money.

312
00:18:49,843 --> 00:18:50,990
What do you think?

313
00:18:51,195 --> 00:18:53,202
That I ended up
giving my heart to that girl?

314
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:54,922
No, Dad.
No!

315
00:18:55,577 --> 00:18:57,011
I have come to tell you

316
00:18:57,298 --> 00:18:59,428
that you need to get a safe made

317
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:01,640
because I'll be getting my hands
on a ton of money.

318
00:19:02,336 --> 00:19:03,606
You may have heard
about this kind of wealth

319
00:19:04,384 --> 00:19:05,900
but I bet you've never seen it.

320
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:07,866
Rs. 10 crores!

321
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:09,750
What the. .

322
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:11,429
Dad!

323
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:13,764
My late father!

324
00:19:14,297 --> 00:19:16,386
Dad! - What. . 
- Dad. .

325
00:19:16,426 --> 00:19:17,614
Sikander. .

326
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,663
For the first time

327
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:21,874
I feel that I am lucky

328
00:19:22,284 --> 00:19:23,881
to have a son like you.

329
00:19:24,004 --> 00:19:25,356
But you made a mistake, Dad.

330
00:19:26,216 --> 00:19:27,691
I am a king

331
00:19:28,141 --> 00:19:29,862
not your son.
- What!

332
00:19:47,557 --> 00:19:48,867
Oh, God!

333
00:20:04,555 --> 00:20:05,743
What nonsense. .

334
00:20:22,046 --> 00:20:23,601
Hey. .

335
00:20:24,912 --> 00:20:26,674
Leave me!

336
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,608
No. . 
No!

337
00:21:26,353 --> 00:21:27,459
Well done, Mr. Romeo.

338
00:21:28,237 --> 00:21:29,425
Very well done!

339
00:21:30,408 --> 00:21:31,965
They show this kind of situation
in films.

340
00:21:32,743 --> 00:21:33,849
An empty street.

341
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:35,774
A lonesome girl.

342
00:21:36,634 --> 00:21:37,699
A few goons.

343
00:21:38,478 --> 00:21:39,747
The girl is about to be molested.

344
00:21:39,788 --> 00:21:42,615
So, the hero was bound to show up.

345
00:21:43,598 --> 00:21:45,031
You showed up at the right time.

346
00:21:45,482 --> 00:21:46,874
You protected my honour.

347
00:21:47,366 --> 00:21:49,127
Even I have a duty, you know.

348
00:21:49,987 --> 00:21:51,298
I have to give you my heart.

349
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:53,633
Otherwise, how will
our love story start?

350
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,231
Right?
- What!

351
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,777
This is an old method
to impress girls.

352
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,047
You need to come up
with a new approach.

353
00:22:01,129 --> 00:22:01,948
Do you get it?

354
00:22:18,332 --> 00:22:21,035
"Today, I have blossomed
into a young lady. "

355
00:22:21,158 --> 00:22:21,978
Water the plants.

356
00:22:22,019 --> 00:22:24,722
"I was a budding flower.
Now, I am a garden. "

357
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:25,746
Water the plants.

358
00:22:25,787 --> 00:22:27,671
"My shoes are from Japan. . "

359
00:22:36,314 --> 00:22:37,502
"My beloved!"

360
00:22:37,788 --> 00:22:41,106
"My beloved. . "
- Listen. .

361
00:22:41,475 --> 00:22:42,417
Dear, you are here!

362
00:22:42,786 --> 00:22:43,769
We are so fortunate

363
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:44,834
that you graced us
with your presence.

364
00:22:44,916 --> 00:22:46,758
Sir, are you Suraj's father?

365
00:22:46,964 --> 00:22:48,356
That's what his mom used to say.

366
00:22:48,561 --> 00:22:50,855
But I still can't believe it.
- What!

367
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:53,312
He is naive. - Okay. . 
- He utters rubbish.

368
00:22:53,353 --> 00:22:54,623
Dhaniram. .

369
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:55,483
Come inside.

370
00:22:55,525 --> 00:22:57,736
Don't worry about me.
Go help Suraj.

371
00:22:58,228 --> 00:22:59,456
He ended up hurting himself
while trying to protect me.

372
00:22:59,784 --> 00:23:00,972
He is bleeding profusely.

373
00:23:01,013 --> 00:23:02,242
It doesn't matter.

374
00:23:02,446 --> 00:23:04,331
When your good fortune
knocks at the door

375
00:23:04,372 --> 00:23:05,724
injuries mean nothing.

376
00:23:05,805 --> 00:23:08,140
Please come inside.
- I can't understand anything.

377
00:23:08,181 --> 00:23:10,024
Why are you people saying
such crazy things?

378
00:23:10,065 --> 00:23:13,055
When a beggar wins the lottery,
he tends to go crazy.

379
00:23:13,424 --> 00:23:14,735
What!

380
00:23:15,472 --> 00:23:17,684
He is naive.
He utters rubbish.

381
00:23:17,766 --> 00:23:18,913
Dhaniram!

382
00:23:18,954 --> 00:23:19,937
Come inside.

383
00:23:20,633 --> 00:23:23,500
Sir, let's take Suraj inside.

384
00:23:23,541 --> 00:23:25,507
The girl will follow him.

385
00:23:25,794 --> 00:23:26,695
Naive. .

386
00:23:27,555 --> 00:23:31,406
Dhaniram, for the first time,
you have said something smart.

387
00:23:31,488 --> 00:23:33,126
Come.
- Come.

388
00:23:49,879 --> 00:23:52,623
Mr. Dhaniram. - Yes?
- Please call the doctor.

389
00:23:52,705 --> 00:23:54,753
No, there's no need to do that.
You tell me.

390
00:23:54,835 --> 00:23:56,474
What will you eat?
Do you want to drink something?

391
00:23:56,637 --> 00:23:57,784
Why are you staring at us?

392
00:23:57,825 --> 00:23:59,218
Go inside and get something.

393
00:23:59,259 --> 00:24:00,611
There is nothing in the kitchen.

394
00:24:00,692 --> 00:24:02,003
Then get something from the market.

395
00:24:02,167 --> 00:24:03,724
Three years ago,
the shopkeepers stopped

396
00:24:03,764 --> 00:24:06,140
giving us things on credit.

397
00:24:06,591 --> 00:24:08,721
Sir. . - Yes?
- Don't worry about me. Please!

398
00:24:08,967 --> 00:24:10,564
It's imperative that Suraj
regains consciousness.

399
00:24:10,605 --> 00:24:12,325
He has sustained
a severe blow to the head.

400
00:24:12,407 --> 00:24:15,275
You are getting worked up
because you don't know him.

401
00:24:16,053 --> 00:24:17,937
Can you see that cliff?

402
00:24:18,879 --> 00:24:21,910
One day,
Suraj was flying a kite there.

403
00:24:21,951 --> 00:24:23,139
He slipped.

404
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:24,367
He tumbled down. .

405
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,907
He fell into my lap.

406
00:24:26,948 --> 00:24:28,709
I was really worried.

407
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:31,741
My accountant was worried.
- I was more worried than he was.

408
00:24:31,781 --> 00:24:33,543
He ran to the doctor.

409
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:35,550
What did he see when he came back?

410
00:24:35,591 --> 00:24:37,065
I saw that the doctor
was standing here

411
00:24:37,106 --> 00:24:40,056
while Suraj was again standing
on the cliff

412
00:24:40,096 --> 00:24:41,325
flying a kite.

413
00:24:41,612 --> 00:24:43,701
He was flying a kite.
He will regain consciousness.

414
00:24:43,742 --> 00:24:44,807
Sit comfortably.
- Okay, I will.

415
00:24:44,889 --> 00:24:45,749
Hey!

416
00:24:45,954 --> 00:24:47,920
You sit, dear.
Take a seat.

417
00:25:15,896 --> 00:25:19,255
I think we've hit the bulls-eye.

418
00:25:20,033 --> 00:25:21,098
Sir. . 
- Yes?

419
00:25:21,426 --> 00:25:22,941
It's been five hours.
- Yes. .

420
00:25:23,105 --> 00:25:25,399
The poor girl hasn't eaten
or drank anything.

421
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:27,160
If you allow me,
should I serve her some food?

422
00:25:27,201 --> 00:25:30,478
Dhaniram. - Yes?
- She isn't hungry or thirsty.

423
00:25:30,805 --> 00:25:33,632
She is completely full.
- How is that?

424
00:25:34,041 --> 00:25:36,949
Love has made her content.
- Oh. .

425
00:25:37,032 --> 00:25:41,210
She is drunk with love.
- Oh. . - Oh, my!

426
00:25:43,954 --> 00:25:45,183
Dear. .

427
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:47,477
Dear. . 
- Yes?

428
00:25:47,518 --> 00:25:48,992
It's really late.
You should go home

429
00:25:49,033 --> 00:25:50,508
otherwise
your family will be worried.

430
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:51,695
But. .

431
00:25:51,736 --> 00:25:53,211
He isn't running away, is he?

432
00:25:53,252 --> 00:25:55,013
Come back in the morning.
- Okay. . - Okay?

433
00:25:55,423 --> 00:25:58,454
Dear, do come in the morning.

434
00:25:58,904 --> 00:26:00,789
Otherwise, he will start screaming
as soon as he wakes up.

435
00:26:00,912 --> 00:26:04,106
He will ask me
as to why I let you go!

436
00:26:04,311 --> 00:26:06,564
He will say that his life
has been ruined!

437
00:26:06,974 --> 00:26:07,957
Okay.

438
00:26:10,824 --> 00:26:12,053
Dhaniram.
- Yes?

439
00:26:12,298 --> 00:26:13,240
Well, what do you think of her?

440
00:26:13,568 --> 00:26:15,903
You've already planned to rob
her father of all his money.

441
00:26:15,985 --> 00:26:17,132
She doesn't have a father!

442
00:26:18,811 --> 00:26:19,835
She just has a mother.

443
00:26:19,876 --> 00:26:21,801
Then maybe
she will be smitten with you.

444
00:26:21,842 --> 00:26:23,112
Dhaniram!

445
00:26:23,153 --> 00:26:25,447
He is naive.
He is making a mistake.

446
00:26:30,813 --> 00:26:32,820
She is back!
She is back!

447
00:26:32,861 --> 00:26:34,008
Where had you been?

448
00:26:34,581 --> 00:26:35,810
Mom. .

449
00:26:35,851 --> 00:26:37,161
Mom, you know Suraj?

450
00:26:38,022 --> 00:26:39,906
He got hurt on his head, Mom.

451
00:26:40,521 --> 00:26:41,995
He lost a lot of blood.

452
00:26:42,036 --> 00:26:43,388
Was he fighting with someone?

453
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:44,535
Yes, Brother Chunnu.

454
00:26:45,067 --> 00:26:47,197
Just like yesterday, some goons
were after me today as well.

455
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:48,508
Then what happened?

456
00:26:48,549 --> 00:26:50,433
He got hurt
while trying to save me.

457
00:26:50,515 --> 00:26:53,792
You tied your dupatta on his wound.

458
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,536
You don't need to go
to Suraj's house

459
00:26:56,577 --> 00:26:58,871
to bring that dupatta.

460
00:26:59,157 --> 00:27:01,738
I will forget that you
came home in this state.

461
00:27:02,025 --> 00:27:03,253
Even you need to forget

462
00:27:03,294 --> 00:27:05,466
that you left your dupatta
somewhere. - Okay.

463
00:27:05,834 --> 00:27:07,063
Go change your clothes, quickly.

464
00:27:07,104 --> 00:27:08,824
We will be waiting for you
to join us for dinner.

465
00:27:15,869 --> 00:27:16,934
What is this, Aunt?

466
00:27:17,139 --> 00:27:19,064
She merely forgot
to bring her dupatta.

467
00:27:19,105 --> 00:27:20,457
It wasn't an expensive necklace,
you know.

468
00:27:20,662 --> 00:27:23,898
A woman's honour is more precious
than any piece of jewellery.

469
00:27:25,659 --> 00:27:27,420
When a woman uses a piece of cloth,
which represents her honour

470
00:27:27,461 --> 00:27:28,854
to nurse someone's wound

471
00:27:30,369 --> 00:27:32,376
she's not doing him just a favour.

472
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:34,547
It becomes something else.

473
00:27:45,689 --> 00:27:49,007
'A woman's honour is more precious
than any piece of jewellery. '

474
00:27:49,293 --> 00:27:51,341
'When a woman uses a piece of cloth,
which represents her honour'

475
00:27:51,423 --> 00:27:52,979
'to nurse someone's wound'

476
00:27:53,266 --> 00:27:55,396
'she's not doing him just a favour. '

477
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,707
'It becomes something else. '

478
00:28:07,971 --> 00:28:09,282
Dad. . 
- Don't get up, lie down.

479
00:28:09,323 --> 00:28:11,698
Don't get up, lie down. . 
- Yes. .

480
00:28:17,351 --> 00:28:18,989
It's 9 a. m.
I have to go to college.

481
00:28:20,751 --> 00:28:23,659
The purpose of your life
has walked into your life.

482
00:28:23,741 --> 00:28:25,584
You don't need to go to college.

483
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:27,919
I have found my purpose?
- Yes.

484
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,950
I can't. . 
- Oh, my child!

485
00:28:31,114 --> 00:28:32,998
You are a great actor!

486
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:35,414
It was wrong of me
to think that he is foolish.

487
00:28:35,824 --> 00:28:37,380
Mr. Dhaniram,
what has happened to dad?

488
00:28:37,913 --> 00:28:40,289
Why is he uttering nonsense?
I can't understand anything.

489
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:42,624
He isn't speaking.
He has lost his mind.

490
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:45,040
You have done
what he wanted you to.

491
00:28:45,081 --> 00:28:46,678
Me? - Yes. . 
- What have I done?

492
00:28:47,088 --> 00:28:49,055
Touch your head.

493
00:28:53,069 --> 00:28:54,543
Oh, I got it.

494
00:28:55,198 --> 00:28:57,984
You are talking
about that arrogant girl. - Yes.

495
00:28:58,475 --> 00:29:01,424
But. . 
But who brought me home?

496
00:29:01,465 --> 00:29:04,701
She is the one
who brought you home, dear.

497
00:29:04,906 --> 00:29:06,749
But she is no arrogant girl.

498
00:29:07,692 --> 00:29:10,600
She took care of you all night.

499
00:29:10,764 --> 00:29:14,163
She massaged your arms.
She massaged your legs.

500
00:29:14,409 --> 00:29:16,662
I bet even Goddess Sita
didn't take such good care

501
00:29:16,703 --> 00:29:17,604
of Lord Ram.

502
00:29:17,645 --> 00:29:20,471
I tried to convince her to go home

503
00:29:20,758 --> 00:29:24,280
but she said that she wanted
to take care of the person

504
00:29:24,322 --> 00:29:26,656
who protected her honour.

505
00:29:26,984 --> 00:29:29,032
She started crying.

506
00:29:29,155 --> 00:29:31,694
She left at 5 a. m.

507
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:33,292
But, sir,
she left last night itself.

508
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:35,545
Go for an eye check-up.
- What!

509
00:29:35,586 --> 00:29:37,634
Can't you tell the difference
between day and night?

510
00:29:37,674 --> 00:29:39,436
Sir, I got it.

511
00:29:39,682 --> 00:29:44,065
You see, you become blind
when you see money

512
00:29:44,105 --> 00:29:45,744
and you consider others
to be blind as well.

513
00:29:45,826 --> 00:29:48,037
What! - Sir, I am naive.
I made a mistake.

514
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:49,061
I am naive.

515
00:29:50,004 --> 00:29:50,946
Who could it be
so early in the morning?

516
00:29:50,986 --> 00:29:52,175
I am sure it's her!
- What!

517
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:53,403
I am sure it's her!

518
00:29:53,649 --> 00:29:56,475
"I can't sleep.
I am restless. "

519
00:29:57,049 --> 00:29:59,138
"I have lost my heart. "

520
00:30:00,408 --> 00:30:02,292
Do you think this
is a musical performance? - What. .

521
00:30:02,415 --> 00:30:03,439
Go get the door!

522
00:30:08,313 --> 00:30:10,525
Greetings, Mr. Dhaniram.
- God bless you, dear.

523
00:30:10,607 --> 00:30:11,590
Did Suraj regain consciousness?

524
00:30:11,631 --> 00:30:13,597
Being conscious is of no use

525
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:15,686
if a man speaks as though
he is unconscious. - What. .

526
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:17,242
See for yourself.

527
00:30:17,447 --> 00:30:18,553
Okay. . 
- Go.

528
00:30:21,257 --> 00:30:23,387
Let's go out. We don't want
to play gooseberry, do we?

529
00:30:23,428 --> 00:30:25,230
I got it, sir.
- Then let's go. - Let's go.

530
00:30:25,271 --> 00:30:26,459
Damn fool.

531
00:30:35,511 --> 00:30:37,682
You!
- Are you still angry with me?

532
00:30:44,357 --> 00:30:47,881
I agree, I misunderstood you.

533
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:51,321
You can punish me for that.

534
00:30:51,813 --> 00:30:54,802
I have nothing. I can
neither punish nor reward you.

535
00:30:56,277 --> 00:30:57,751
But I have everything.

536
00:30:58,243 --> 00:31:00,374
That's exactly why I want
to stay away from you.

537
00:31:00,661 --> 00:31:01,684
Why?

538
00:31:02,175 --> 00:31:04,839
Can't we be good friends?
- Yes, we can.

539
00:31:05,699 --> 00:31:08,607
But your wealth
can sour our friendship.

540
00:31:08,853 --> 00:31:10,122
That will never happen.

541
00:31:11,514 --> 00:31:12,580
What if it does?

542
00:31:12,826 --> 00:31:16,184
I will sacrifice myself
for the sake of our friendship.

543
00:31:16,675 --> 00:31:17,823
Really?

544
00:32:04,436 --> 00:32:10,294
"O beloved,
the moment our eyes met"

545
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:16,150
"my love for you soared. "

546
00:32:16,396 --> 00:32:22,131
"My love and your obsession"

547
00:32:22,294 --> 00:32:25,120
"may fade away tomorrow. "

548
00:32:25,572 --> 00:32:30,856
"Come, embrace me. "

549
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:36,221
"Come, embrace me. "

550
00:32:36,467 --> 00:32:42,406
"O beloved,
the moment our eyes met"

551
00:32:42,529 --> 00:32:48,141
"my love for you soared. "

552
00:32:48,264 --> 00:32:54,120
"Your love and my obsession"

553
00:32:54,203 --> 00:32:57,111
"may fade away tomorrow. "

554
00:32:57,603 --> 00:33:03,091
"Come, embrace me. "

555
00:33:03,296 --> 00:33:08,374
"Come, embrace me. "

556
00:33:32,582 --> 00:33:38,277
"Since the day I met you"

557
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:44,052
"anxiety has become
my new identity. "

558
00:33:44,216 --> 00:33:49,992
"No matter where I am,
your face flashes before my eyes. "

559
00:33:50,073 --> 00:33:55,848
"When I look into the mirror,
I see your face. "

560
00:33:58,921 --> 00:34:04,654
"Your words. . Your warm breath. . 
There's fragrance in your breath. "

561
00:34:04,983 --> 00:34:10,595
"I'm out of control.
You're out of control. "

562
00:34:10,921 --> 00:34:16,493
"I don't know
how to deal with it anymore. "

563
00:34:16,534 --> 00:34:22,678
"I've started to love you
even more. "

564
00:34:24,438 --> 00:34:30,337
"Our inner voices
and feelings for each other"

565
00:34:30,378 --> 00:34:33,285
"may disappear tomorrow. "

566
00:34:33,777 --> 00:34:39,389
"Come, embrace me. "

567
00:34:39,553 --> 00:34:45,042
"Come, embrace me. "

568
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:50,858
"Come, embrace me. "

569
00:34:50,981 --> 00:34:56,921
"Come, embrace me. "

570
00:35:25,879 --> 00:35:31,573
"My yearning for you
keeps surging. "

571
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:37,472
"You are giving me
sleepless nights. "

572
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:43,370
"Even I spend my nights,
tossing and turning. "

573
00:35:43,616 --> 00:35:49,145
"I think both of us are going
through the same thing. "

574
00:35:52,217 --> 00:35:57,747
"If you can't talk,
say it with your eyes. "

575
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:03,891
"Staying away from you is arduous. "

576
00:36:03,972 --> 00:36:09,747
"Let us use gestures to express
our love for each other. "

577
00:36:09,789 --> 00:36:15,483
"I'll tell you a few things.
You tell me a few things. "

578
00:36:17,612 --> 00:36:23,429
"These memorable meetings
and lovely moments"

579
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:26,542
"may not exist tomorrow. "

580
00:36:26,993 --> 00:36:32,564
"Come, embrace me. "

581
00:36:32,768 --> 00:36:37,887
"Come, embrace me. "

582
00:36:38,298 --> 00:36:43,951
"Come, embrace me. "

583
00:36:44,114 --> 00:36:49,890
"Come, embrace me. "

584
00:37:13,975 --> 00:37:15,285
What's the matter, my son?

585
00:37:16,064 --> 00:37:18,480
How come you're drinking
before sunset today?

586
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:21,061
Yes, I'm drinking before sunset.

587
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:23,396
Why don't you have a peg too?

588
00:37:24,379 --> 00:37:28,434
Coming to the wealth
that you are after

589
00:37:29,089 --> 00:37:31,055
someone else
is going to acquire it.

590
00:37:31,095 --> 00:37:32,899
I'm not an idiot

591
00:37:33,184 --> 00:37:35,806
that someone can take advantage
of me.

592
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:40,557
My son, if drinking
could solve all problems

593
00:37:40,886 --> 00:37:43,835
our nation would have drowned
in it.

594
00:37:44,735 --> 00:37:46,784
Tell me the name of the man

595
00:37:47,398 --> 00:37:50,388
who wants to kill our dreams.

596
00:37:50,634 --> 00:37:53,256
Suraj.
- Father's name? - Mangtaram.

597
00:37:53,297 --> 00:37:56,246
Okay. . 
It's that stingy man, right?

598
00:37:56,574 --> 00:37:58,867
Even if there's a fly
in his cup of tea

599
00:37:58,908 --> 00:38:02,103
he drinks it up, right?
- Yes, he's the one.

600
00:38:02,349 --> 00:38:03,782
Sikander, it's time to celebrate

601
00:38:03,824 --> 00:38:08,370
because tomorrow morning,
Suraj will be out of your life.

602
00:38:08,739 --> 00:38:09,803
How?

603
00:38:10,336 --> 00:38:14,269
Mr. Mangtaram is going
to put an end

604
00:38:15,497 --> 00:38:17,217
to his son, Suraj's, love affair.

605
00:38:17,299 --> 00:38:18,527
Mr. Khanna.

606
00:38:18,815 --> 00:38:22,420
We hardly know each other.

607
00:38:22,705 --> 00:38:24,509
How can you interfere
in my private matters?

608
00:38:25,246 --> 00:38:27,335
This matter has become public now.

609
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:30,447
That's why I'm having
this conversation with you.

610
00:38:30,735 --> 00:38:34,502
It's my duty to caution you
against the danger.

611
00:38:34,544 --> 00:38:35,814
Goodbye.

612
00:38:39,336 --> 00:38:40,442
Just a minute.

613
00:38:41,344 --> 00:38:45,112
If it turns out that you have
falsely accused my daughter

614
00:38:45,399 --> 00:38:48,347
then I don't want to see you
anywhere near this place.

615
00:38:48,429 --> 00:38:50,273
What if it turns out to be true?

616
00:38:50,314 --> 00:38:54,123
In that case,
you will always be welcome here.

617
00:38:54,409 --> 00:38:56,540
You will be considered
a good friend.

618
00:38:56,827 --> 00:38:57,932
Only a friend!

619
00:38:58,218 --> 00:39:01,619
A friend can become family too,
right, Shakuntala Devi?

620
00:39:02,642 --> 00:39:03,708
Probably.

621
00:39:03,994 --> 00:39:06,370
Hi, Mom.
Hi, Sikander!

622
00:39:11,735 --> 00:39:13,293
Why are you all so quiet?

623
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:15,136
What's the matter, Mom?

624
00:39:15,421 --> 00:39:18,044
Where were you?
- At Suraj's place.

625
00:39:18,739 --> 00:39:21,526
You must stop seeing Suraj
from tomorrow. - Why?

626
00:39:21,811 --> 00:39:22,959
Because I say so!

627
00:39:24,475 --> 00:39:28,078
Your pet dogs have brought
some information for you, right?

628
00:39:29,184 --> 00:39:32,462
I don't care much
for barking dogs. - Roshni!

629
00:39:34,674 --> 00:39:37,663
Now that you've involved outsiders
in our private matters

630
00:39:37,951 --> 00:39:39,425
I would like to tell you something.

631
00:39:39,466 --> 00:39:43,561
I love Suraj.
That's all.

632
00:39:46,716 --> 00:39:49,871
Since Roshni called me a dog

633
00:39:51,878 --> 00:39:54,417
I think it's time to prove
my loyalty.

634
00:39:56,629 --> 00:39:59,250
Is this a house or a playground?

635
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:01,994
Oh, my. .

636
00:40:02,814 --> 00:40:04,943
Hey. . 
Careful.

637
00:40:11,293 --> 00:40:13,832
Welcome.
We had been waiting for you.

638
00:40:14,242 --> 00:40:16,617
What the. . 
Where did that voice come from?

639
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:21,697
Who's Mangtaram
out of the two of you?

640
00:40:21,738 --> 00:40:25,260
The one who looks like a beggar.
- What!

641
00:40:26,858 --> 00:40:29,602
It's me. But let me
tell you something first.

642
00:40:29,765 --> 00:40:32,182
My name's not Mangtaram.
It's Mangatram.

643
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:35,500
But the whole city
calls you Mangtaram.

644
00:40:35,746 --> 00:40:39,801
You see,
my mom couldn't have a child.

645
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:42,913
I was adopted.

646
00:40:43,159 --> 00:40:45,044
None of the clothes they had
fit me.

647
00:40:45,167 --> 00:40:46,477
I couldn't have
roamed around nude, right?

648
00:40:46,519 --> 00:40:50,000
My dad went to an orphanage and
got me some clothes that fit me.

649
00:40:50,246 --> 00:40:53,031
I got used to begging
right from childhood.

650
00:40:53,195 --> 00:40:54,341
I used to beg my neighbours
for some food

651
00:40:54,424 --> 00:40:56,472
and would eat it at night
for dinner.

652
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:58,971
By the way, what's your name?

653
00:40:59,011 --> 00:41:00,814
Don't try to act smart, Mangtaram.

654
00:41:01,591 --> 00:41:04,049
You've chosen the right family.
- What do you mean?

655
00:41:04,091 --> 00:41:05,646
Let me explain it to you.

656
00:41:06,549 --> 00:41:08,350
Roshni is my only daughter.

657
00:41:09,539 --> 00:41:11,832
She's the sole heir to the property
that's worth crores of rupees.

658
00:41:13,019 --> 00:41:18,057
Your son tricked her
into falling in love with him.

659
00:41:18,222 --> 00:41:19,574
Shakuntala Devi.

660
00:41:19,615 --> 00:41:23,015
We may be poor
but we don't disrespect two lovers.

661
00:41:23,301 --> 00:41:25,882
My son and I
can kiss your wealth goodbye!

662
00:41:25,964 --> 00:41:27,356
But we can't let go of Roshni!

663
00:41:28,748 --> 00:41:30,468
Lower your arm.
- Why?

664
00:41:30,552 --> 00:41:33,500
Your kurta is torn in the armpits,
which reflects your standard.

665
00:41:36,777 --> 00:41:38,210
Seems like it was all in vain. .

666
00:41:38,252 --> 00:41:40,422
Sir. . 
- Hey, don't intervene!

667
00:41:40,668 --> 00:41:42,756
Torn clothes can be sewn

668
00:41:42,799 --> 00:41:44,805
but dignity once lost
can never be regained!

669
00:41:44,845 --> 00:41:46,977
Wow. . Sir. . 
- Exactly!

670
00:41:47,263 --> 00:41:48,205
Listen.

671
00:41:50,252 --> 00:41:51,769
This is yours now.

672
00:41:54,799 --> 00:41:56,561
Mine?
- Yes.

673
00:41:56,971 --> 00:42:00,739
Sir, first, ask him
why he is giving you money.

674
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:02,540
He is giving me something,
not taking something. - Okay. .

675
00:42:02,746 --> 00:42:03,646
We will take something from you.

676
00:42:04,015 --> 00:42:05,981
We just need your word.
- What!

677
00:42:06,064 --> 00:42:08,767
From now on, your son
will stop dreaming about Roshni.

678
00:42:09,218 --> 00:42:11,717
Are you talking about
blinding him? - Yes.

679
00:42:12,248 --> 00:42:14,133
In that case,
take Rs. 5 lakhs from me

680
00:42:14,256 --> 00:42:15,934
and have yourself treated
because you'll be made blind.

681
00:42:16,018 --> 00:42:18,392
Goodbye.
- Wait.

682
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:20,154
What is it?

683
00:42:21,547 --> 00:42:23,144
These are for you too.

684
00:42:25,316 --> 00:42:27,036
Dhaniram.
- Yes, sir?

685
00:42:27,282 --> 00:42:30,600
Have we entered
the Reserve Bank of India?

686
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:33,752
No, sir, you have reached
a slaughterhouse.

687
00:42:33,835 --> 00:42:35,719
Why?
- Because you're selling your son

688
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,930
the way people sell their animals.

689
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:40,717
Hey, at times,
people even sell their daughters.

690
00:42:40,757 --> 00:42:42,560
At least I am better than them.

691
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:43,706
Yes. . 
- I am a son's father.

692
00:42:43,748 --> 00:42:46,655
But, sir, this deal
will cost you dearly.

693
00:42:47,638 --> 00:42:49,523
This deal will benefit me.

694
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:51,162
Ask me how.

695
00:42:51,366 --> 00:42:53,290
Hey, ask me, will you?
- Me? - Yes.

696
00:42:53,332 --> 00:42:54,234
How?

697
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:58,616
I always wanted my son
to marry a girl

698
00:42:58,697 --> 00:43:00,664
who brings a lot of riches
with her.

699
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:04,064
But here, we are getting paid
to break a relationship!

700
00:43:04,883 --> 00:43:05,907
Give them to me.

701
00:43:06,112 --> 00:43:07,299
Remember, you gave us your word.

702
00:43:07,341 --> 00:43:09,265
I have got it in writing.
Read it.

703
00:43:10,248 --> 00:43:12,502
From now on,
Suraj will stay away from Roshni.

704
00:43:12,543 --> 00:43:14,878
Absolutely!
Let's go. Hurry up. - Yes. .

705
00:43:14,918 --> 00:43:17,376
Shakuntala Devi, don't you worry.

706
00:43:17,458 --> 00:43:19,956
Suraj will be gone
from Roshni's life, forever.

707
00:43:19,998 --> 00:43:22,251
I will keep him under check.

708
00:43:22,659 --> 00:43:25,200
But that will be difficult. . 
- Hey. .

709
00:43:27,248 --> 00:43:28,435
Mr. Mangatram, what is this?

710
00:43:28,517 --> 00:43:30,689
Hey, this is money, silly girl.

711
00:43:31,015 --> 00:43:32,490
My son is not a prince, is he?

712
00:43:32,819 --> 00:43:34,825
He won't let go of wealth
for his lover.

713
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:39,003
I always choose wealth over lovers.

714
00:43:43,345 --> 00:43:46,253
Mom, why had Suraj's father
come here?

715
00:43:47,810 --> 00:43:50,022
He came here to trade
Suraj's love for you with money.

716
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:51,291
That is a lie.

717
00:43:51,701 --> 00:43:53,667
I knew you would say that.

718
00:43:55,837 --> 00:43:57,066
Here you go.
Read it.

719
00:44:01,613 --> 00:44:02,924
'It's our family business'

720
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:05,136
'to take wealth
in exchange for love. '

721
00:44:05,791 --> 00:44:07,307
'I can do anything for money. '

722
00:44:08,331 --> 00:44:13,329
'I never loved you nor will I
ever love you in the future. '

723
00:44:14,434 --> 00:44:16,933
'I love nothing but money. '

724
00:44:18,121 --> 00:44:20,045
'For me, money is everything. '

725
00:44:20,497 --> 00:44:21,888
'Suraj. '

726
00:44:24,142 --> 00:44:26,066
'Hey, this is money, silly girl. '

727
00:44:26,435 --> 00:44:27,992
'My son is not a prince, is he?'

728
00:44:28,197 --> 00:44:30,121
'He won't let go of wealth
for his lover. '

729
00:44:30,490 --> 00:44:34,218
'I always choose wealth over lovers. '

730
00:44:43,557 --> 00:44:44,663
Roshni.

731
00:44:45,973 --> 00:44:47,121
Don't cry, my dear.

732
00:44:47,408 --> 00:44:49,045
Don't.
- Mom!

733
00:44:49,374 --> 00:44:50,725
Mom!
- No, my dear!

734
00:44:51,748 --> 00:44:52,896
Roshni.

735
00:44:54,125 --> 00:44:57,278
We are fortunate to have discovered
Suraj's motives now itself.

736
00:44:57,647 --> 00:45:00,596
Your life would've been ruined had
we come to know about it later.

737
00:45:03,053 --> 00:45:05,594
Parents always make things better
for their kids

738
00:45:05,963 --> 00:45:07,314
not worse.

739
00:45:07,396 --> 00:45:10,386
I have chosen Sikander for you
after giving it a lot of thought.

740
00:45:10,918 --> 00:45:14,400
Mom. . Mom, do whatever
you think is right.

741
00:45:14,481 --> 00:45:15,998
Whatever you think. . 
- Roshni.

742
00:45:56,713 --> 00:45:58,679
'Hey, this is money, silly girl. '

743
00:45:58,719 --> 00:46:00,276
'My son is not a prince, is he?'

744
00:46:00,358 --> 00:46:02,447
'He won't let go of wealth
for his lover. '

745
00:46:02,488 --> 00:46:06,297
'I always choose wealth over lovers. '

746
00:46:22,272 --> 00:46:23,378
Roshni!

747
00:46:30,177 --> 00:46:31,324
Roshni!

748
00:46:31,405 --> 00:46:32,634
Stop, Roshni!

749
00:47:06,837 --> 00:47:08,189
Why are you avoiding me?

750
00:47:08,392 --> 00:47:09,458
What has happened to you?

751
00:47:11,056 --> 00:47:12,039
Me?

752
00:47:13,104 --> 00:47:14,905
Am I the one
who's avoiding you, Suraj?

753
00:47:16,749 --> 00:47:17,651
Or. .

754
00:47:18,715 --> 00:47:20,764
I told you on that very day

755
00:47:20,804 --> 00:47:23,384
that your wealth
can sour our friendship.

756
00:47:23,876 --> 00:47:27,031
But. . But do you remember
what you said?

757
00:47:28,299 --> 00:47:31,331
That you would rather die
than end our friendship.

758
00:47:34,198 --> 00:47:36,041
What a way to keep a promise!

759
00:47:36,861 --> 00:47:38,664
Before I could commit suicide

760
00:47:39,482 --> 00:47:41,939
you and your father
killed me from the inside!

761
00:47:41,981 --> 00:47:43,087
What!

762
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:45,503
Here you go, read it.

763
00:48:26,997 --> 00:48:27,980
Dad!

764
00:48:31,706 --> 00:48:34,410
Come, my jackpot!

765
00:48:35,107 --> 00:48:39,899
Look, this is Reena,
Meena, Sheena and Tina!

766
00:48:39,939 --> 00:48:41,005
Pick whoever you like.

767
00:48:41,045 --> 00:48:42,234
You should be ashamed of yourself!

768
00:48:42,888 --> 00:48:44,692
How could you. . 
- Hey. .

769
00:48:44,774 --> 00:48:47,723
One needs to be young at heart.

770
00:48:47,927 --> 00:48:49,730
The heart always stays young.

771
00:48:49,812 --> 00:48:52,351
My body may have aged
but not my heart.

772
00:48:52,392 --> 00:48:56,734
You destroyed my dreams
to fulfil yours?

773
00:48:57,963 --> 00:48:58,905
Dad. .

774
00:48:59,274 --> 00:49:02,100
I can't live without Roshni. . 
- What does Roshni have

775
00:49:02,141 --> 00:49:03,738
that Tina and Meena lack?

776
00:49:03,984 --> 00:49:06,565
Reena and Sheena are the same too.
You can check if you like.

777
00:49:07,261 --> 00:49:10,702
Today, I am ashamed
to be your son!

778
00:49:10,743 --> 00:49:13,323
And I am proud to have
a son like you

779
00:49:13,363 --> 00:49:15,452
who got me all this money.

780
00:49:18,935 --> 00:49:21,024
That means,
you traded my love for money!

781
00:49:21,065 --> 00:49:23,358
But I got money
in exchange for it, right?

782
00:49:23,399 --> 00:49:26,185
Is money everything for you?
What about me?

783
00:49:26,308 --> 00:49:27,740
Doesn't my happiness matter to you?

784
00:49:27,782 --> 00:49:30,526
My son, money can buy
all kinds of happiness.

785
00:49:30,566 --> 00:49:32,329
I will leave this house then!

786
00:49:32,698 --> 00:49:34,787
Go buy a new son with this money!

787
00:49:37,817 --> 00:49:39,866
Sir, stop him,
he really is leaving!

788
00:49:39,948 --> 00:49:43,020
Hey, if I stop him, I will lose
these heavenly luxuries.

789
00:49:45,518 --> 00:49:49,859
Then why don't you tell him
that you're not his father?

790
00:49:49,942 --> 00:49:51,621
Dhaniram!
- I won't stay quiet

791
00:49:51,662 --> 00:49:52,973
just because
you're raising your voice.

792
00:49:53,791 --> 00:49:56,863
You are not a father but a butcher!

793
00:49:57,028 --> 00:50:00,058
Someone who slaughters a kid
for some money

794
00:50:00,223 --> 00:50:04,155
even if it begs for mercy.
- Dhaniram, mind your tongue!

795
00:50:04,236 --> 00:50:05,753
What will you do?

796
00:50:06,285 --> 00:50:07,677
What will you do?

797
00:50:08,006 --> 00:50:10,134
At the most,
you will fire me, right?

798
00:50:10,913 --> 00:50:13,944
But a person who couldn't be a good
father can't be a good employer.

799
00:50:14,558 --> 00:50:18,819
Mr. Mangtaram,
today, I am convinced

800
00:50:18,859 --> 00:50:21,236
that Suraj is not your son.

801
00:50:21,277 --> 00:50:23,528
Dhaniram!
- You bought him from somewhere!

802
00:50:23,611 --> 00:50:24,840
Shut up!

803
00:50:34,016 --> 00:50:35,940
My lust for money
had blinded me, my son.

804
00:50:37,333 --> 00:50:41,429
For a few moments, I had forgotten
that you mean the world to me.

805
00:50:43,395 --> 00:50:45,607
In this ignorance, I even forgot

806
00:50:46,345 --> 00:50:49,376
that you are the only family
I have got.

807
00:50:50,113 --> 00:50:51,997
Set fire to these stacks of money.

808
00:50:52,570 --> 00:50:54,126
I only need my son.

809
00:50:54,986 --> 00:50:57,035
I want to see him happy.
That's it.

810
00:50:57,444 --> 00:50:59,041
What is the use of all this, Dad?

811
00:50:59,901 --> 00:51:01,582
You already obliterated my love.

812
00:51:02,278 --> 00:51:04,817
Tomorrow is her engagement.

813
00:51:04,859 --> 00:51:08,668
If I can sell my dignity
for Rs. 10 lakhs

814
00:51:08,709 --> 00:51:11,167
I can pay double the amount
to buy it back.

815
00:51:11,575 --> 00:51:12,641
Dad?

816
00:51:12,681 --> 00:51:13,787
Can I say something, my son?

817
00:51:14,607 --> 00:51:18,048
There is no currency in this world

818
00:51:18,539 --> 00:51:20,914
that can separate a son
from his father.

819
00:51:21,693 --> 00:51:23,086
There is no such currency.

820
00:51:27,510 --> 00:51:28,493
Thank you. .

821
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:31,319
Thank you. . 
- Greetings.

822
00:51:32,548 --> 00:51:33,940
Welcome. .

823
00:51:37,012 --> 00:51:39,592
Hi, Doctor!
- Hi, Khanna!

824
00:51:40,044 --> 00:51:42,050
I was waiting for you.

825
00:51:44,836 --> 00:51:45,982
Welcome, Doctor.

826
00:51:46,065 --> 00:51:49,506
This party seemed boring
without you. - Really? - Yes.

827
00:51:50,325 --> 00:51:52,537
Now that you're here,
you'll bring life to the party.

828
00:51:52,863 --> 00:51:55,772
Khanna, didn't you arrange for
some girls for our entertainment?

829
00:51:55,813 --> 00:52:00,728
Rascal, you're growing old
but you still hit on young women.

830
00:52:00,770 --> 00:52:05,071
Khanna, a man never forgets his
heydays no matter how old he gets.

831
00:52:05,112 --> 00:52:07,651
There are plenty of single women
in this party.

832
00:52:07,692 --> 00:52:08,880
You can find one for yourself.

833
00:52:08,921 --> 00:52:12,770
I will get you engaged as well.

834
00:52:12,853 --> 00:52:13,673
Khanna!

835
00:52:14,573 --> 00:52:18,629
He is destined to be with a widow,
not a young lady.

836
00:52:18,668 --> 00:52:21,864
Any woman who ends up with him
will be unlucky!

837
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:29,032
Hello. .

838
00:52:31,039 --> 00:52:36,159
Is she the one whose husband
was killed by us 18 years ago. .

839
00:52:37,552 --> 00:52:39,272
Someone might hear
our conversation.

840
00:52:39,681 --> 00:52:41,484
I got it, Khanna.
I got it.

841
00:52:42,058 --> 00:52:45,417
I see that you
have befriended an enemy.

842
00:52:45,499 --> 00:52:47,383
Let's go. Come on.
Come, Mr. Jagatpal.

843
00:52:49,266 --> 00:52:51,069
Sikander, meet my friend.
- Hello. . - Come. .

844
00:52:51,109 --> 00:52:52,461
Meet my son. . 
- Congratulations, dear.

845
00:52:57,910 --> 00:53:00,121
Dear, you can exchange the rings.

846
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:02,825
Stop!

847
00:53:12,328 --> 00:53:13,434
Who are you?

848
00:53:13,473 --> 00:53:17,366
Khanna, I think
your eyesight is becoming poor.

849
00:53:18,226 --> 00:53:20,397
Otherwise, you would
have recognised me.

850
00:53:21,544 --> 00:53:22,935
Mr. Dhaniram.
- Yes?

851
00:53:22,977 --> 00:53:27,893
Tell them who I am.
- This is my boss. - Yes. .

852
00:53:28,057 --> 00:53:31,743
Yesterday, he had come
to you with a plea. - Yes. .

853
00:53:31,783 --> 00:53:34,078
He wanted to make a deal
with you. - Yes. .

854
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:37,723
And you paid him money in exchange
for his son's love. - Yes. .

855
00:53:37,764 --> 00:53:41,451
And he was so greedy
that he took the money. - Yes. .

856
00:53:42,188 --> 00:53:46,775
You thought that Sikander had won
and Suraj had lost!

857
00:53:48,824 --> 00:53:50,338
You were mistaken.

858
00:53:50,789 --> 00:53:54,804
My boss has been wicked
for the last 50 years

859
00:53:54,845 --> 00:53:56,647
but he mended his ways
overnight. - Oh, yes!

860
00:53:56,728 --> 00:53:59,842
My boss has realised
his mistakes. - Yes.

861
00:53:59,923 --> 00:54:03,692
Here's the money you gave him,
Rs. 10 lakhs.

862
00:54:04,552 --> 00:54:07,952
You gave it to him to stop his son
from marrying Roshni.

863
00:54:09,468 --> 00:54:11,556
Here's Rs. 10 lakhs more.

864
00:54:15,202 --> 00:54:19,994
If your son dares to eye
my would-be daughter-in-law

865
00:54:20,773 --> 00:54:22,821
I will gouge his eyes out.

866
00:54:27,121 --> 00:54:30,235
Shakuntala. .

867
00:54:30,397 --> 00:54:31,668
Shakuntala. .

868
00:54:32,651 --> 00:54:34,330
Shakuntala Devi.

869
00:54:34,658 --> 00:54:37,524
The groom and the groom's
procession are waiting at the door.

870
00:54:37,935 --> 00:54:40,105
Please welcome them.

871
00:54:42,850 --> 00:54:45,718
If you won't welcome them
then I will do it.

872
00:54:45,881 --> 00:54:47,397
Suraj!

873
00:55:35,485 --> 00:55:39,990
"No force can keep us apart. "

874
00:55:40,277 --> 00:55:44,864
"No force can keep us apart. "

875
00:55:45,478 --> 00:55:49,821
"Even God cannot separate us. "

876
00:55:50,148 --> 00:55:54,326
"We'll never get separated. "

877
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:02,027
"We'll never get separated. "

878
00:56:02,232 --> 00:56:06,328
"We'll never get separated. "

879
00:56:06,410 --> 00:56:10,956
"No force can keep us apart. "

880
00:56:11,202 --> 00:56:15,790
"No force can keep us apart. "

881
00:56:16,444 --> 00:56:20,868
"Even God cannot separate us. "

882
00:56:21,113 --> 00:56:25,456
"We'll never get separated. "

883
00:56:28,364 --> 00:56:33,033
"We'll never get separated. "

884
00:56:33,116 --> 00:56:35,328
"We'll never get separated. "

885
00:56:37,417 --> 00:56:41,841
"No force can keep us apart. "

886
00:56:42,578 --> 00:56:46,796
"Even God cannot separate us. "

887
00:56:47,330 --> 00:56:51,180
"We'll never get separated. "

888
00:57:15,550 --> 00:57:20,262
"If I don't meet you"

889
00:57:20,303 --> 00:57:24,849
"I end up having sleepless nights. "

890
00:57:24,972 --> 00:57:29,478
"I grow anxious"

891
00:57:29,642 --> 00:57:34,639
"and I miss you immensely. "

892
00:57:38,735 --> 00:57:43,198
"If I don't meet you"

893
00:57:43,773 --> 00:57:48,320
"I end up having sleepless nights. "

894
00:57:48,770 --> 00:57:53,071
"I grow anxious"

895
00:57:53,235 --> 00:57:58,273
"and I miss you immensely. "

896
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:02,943
"We'll never get separated. "

897
00:58:03,188 --> 00:58:05,440
"We'll never get separated. "

898
00:58:07,325 --> 00:58:12,159
"We are madly in love
with each other. "

899
00:58:12,321 --> 00:58:16,991
"You are my soul mate. "

900
00:58:17,197 --> 00:58:21,415
"We'll never get separated. "

901
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:26,126
"No force can keep us apart. "

902
00:58:26,618 --> 00:58:30,959
"Even God cannot separate us. "

903
00:58:31,205 --> 00:58:35,875
"We'll never get separated. "

904
00:59:03,359 --> 00:59:08,397
"You are always on my mind. "

905
00:59:08,438 --> 00:59:12,902
"You are always on my mind. "

906
00:59:13,108 --> 00:59:17,736
"My heart always yearns for you. "

907
00:59:17,777 --> 00:59:22,651
"My heart always yearns for you. "

908
00:59:27,116 --> 00:59:31,540
"You are always on my mind. "

909
00:59:31,703 --> 00:59:36,210
"You are always on my mind. "

910
00:59:36,618 --> 00:59:40,715
"My heart always yearns for you. "

911
00:59:41,288 --> 00:59:46,449
"My heart always yearns for you. "

912
00:59:46,859 --> 00:59:51,447
"We'll never get separated. "

913
00:59:51,529 --> 00:59:55,502
"We'll never get separated. "

914
00:59:55,665 --> 01:00:00,622
"You are mine and I am yours. "

915
01:00:00,703 --> 01:00:05,372
"You are my soul mate. "

916
01:00:05,455 --> 01:00:09,347
"We'll never get separated. "

917
01:00:09,838 --> 01:00:14,303
"No force can keep us apart. "

918
01:00:14,835 --> 01:00:19,218
"Even God cannot separate us. "

919
01:00:19,587 --> 01:00:23,765
"We'll never get separated. "

920
01:00:36,339 --> 01:00:40,190
How dare you taint my reputation!

921
01:00:40,681 --> 01:00:42,728
I will deal with you later.

922
01:00:42,894 --> 01:00:45,186
First, I'll deal
with that worthless guy.

923
01:00:45,228 --> 01:00:47,398
What are you going to do to Suraj?
What are you going to do?

924
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:49,078
I will get him beaten up!

925
01:00:50,184 --> 01:00:51,453
Like this?

926
01:00:54,771 --> 01:00:56,737
In this manner?

927
01:00:57,228 --> 01:00:58,253
Tell me!

928
01:00:58,295 --> 01:01:00,506
Don't you dare hurt Suraj!

929
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:03,579
D-Don't you dare!

930
01:01:23,485 --> 01:01:26,843
Hi, Khanna.
The party was fun!

931
01:01:27,663 --> 01:01:29,669
That guy sang splendidly.

932
01:01:30,366 --> 01:01:33,356
'No force can keep us apart. '

933
01:01:33,398 --> 01:01:35,486
'We'll never get separated. '

934
01:01:35,527 --> 01:01:37,165
Mathur, stop this nonsense!

935
01:01:37,330 --> 01:01:39,214
We have already been humiliated!

936
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:41,016
Why are you making it worse?

937
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:44,292
Khanna, there's an old saying. .

938
01:01:44,784 --> 01:01:48,102
'A bad workman blames his tools. '

939
01:01:48,143 --> 01:01:50,068
You always speak like a loser.

940
01:01:50,642 --> 01:01:52,198
You don't have any children.

941
01:01:52,402 --> 01:01:54,656
You don't know how it feels
when your child is in pain!

942
01:01:55,312 --> 01:01:57,400
If you had a son

943
01:01:58,055 --> 01:02:00,923
and he got cheated by a girl

944
01:02:00,964 --> 01:02:02,478
then you would. . 
- No one can treat your son

945
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:04,733
if you don't reveal
what illness he's suffering from.

946
01:02:04,774 --> 01:02:05,838
What are you implying?

947
01:02:05,879 --> 01:02:10,303
Your son doesn't love Roshni,
Khanna. He loves her wealth.

948
01:02:10,834 --> 01:02:12,800
But Roshni loves Suraj.

949
01:02:13,292 --> 01:02:18,249
So, you and your son are not going
to acquire Roshni's inheritance

950
01:02:18,987 --> 01:02:20,625
namely, crores of rupees.

951
01:02:22,673 --> 01:02:27,834
So, you lost a chance
to acquire a lot of money.

952
01:02:28,038 --> 01:02:28,940
Correct.

953
01:02:28,981 --> 01:02:33,610
I can help you with it.
- How?

954
01:02:33,651 --> 01:02:36,025
I know a secret

955
01:02:36,067 --> 01:02:39,016
owing to which, Ms. Shakuntala
would rather let her daughter die

956
01:02:39,057 --> 01:02:41,801
than allow her to marry Suraj.

957
01:02:41,843 --> 01:02:43,029
Really, Doctor?

958
01:02:58,513 --> 01:02:59,906
What's that secret?

959
01:03:00,110 --> 01:03:01,913
You have grown very greedy, Khanna.

960
01:03:01,953 --> 01:03:04,207
You want to acquire
all that wealth for yourself.

961
01:03:04,248 --> 01:03:05,517
Tell me what you want.

962
01:03:05,804 --> 01:03:07,114
Rs. 50 lakhs.

963
01:03:08,262 --> 01:03:10,351
Rs. 50 lakhs!
- Rs. 50 lakhs.

964
01:03:11,415 --> 01:03:13,792
Tomorrow, come to me
with Rs. 50 lakhs

965
01:03:14,283 --> 01:03:15,881
and then I'll help you.

966
01:03:16,085 --> 01:03:17,028
Okay. .

967
01:03:17,191 --> 01:03:18,380
Good luck.

968
01:03:20,919 --> 01:03:22,393
Rs. 50 lakhs!

969
01:03:22,966 --> 01:03:24,318
What are you thinking about, Dad?

970
01:03:24,564 --> 01:03:28,210
I am thinking of a way
to trick him

971
01:03:28,906 --> 01:03:30,668
into telling me that secret
without me having to pay him.

972
01:03:35,583 --> 01:03:39,924
Avinash, whenever I come close
to you, you drive me crazy.

973
01:03:40,292 --> 01:03:42,341
Even I am crazy in love with you.

974
01:03:42,381 --> 01:03:45,496
That's why I'm still single.
- I love you, Avinash.

975
01:03:46,805 --> 01:03:48,034
Come on!

976
01:03:52,745 --> 01:03:53,974
Who could it be at this hour?

977
01:03:54,792 --> 01:03:56,719
It might be Khanna.
Go hide, quickly.

978
01:03:59,954 --> 01:04:01,182
Come in!

979
01:04:03,148 --> 01:04:04,336
Come in, Khanna.

980
01:04:07,368 --> 01:04:09,907
Mathur, hurry up and tell me
the secret so that. .

981
01:04:09,948 --> 01:04:12,038
Relax, Khanna.
Relax. .

982
01:04:12,119 --> 01:04:14,864
Don't be in a hurry.

983
01:04:14,945 --> 01:04:18,305
I will tell you the secret.
Do you have the money?

984
01:04:18,345 --> 01:04:19,573
It's in this bag.

985
01:04:19,983 --> 01:04:21,048
So, listen.

986
01:04:38,212 --> 01:04:42,144
Mathur, did you really think
that I am a fool

987
01:04:42,183 --> 01:04:44,436
to pay you Rs. 50 lakhs
for telling me this secret?

988
01:04:44,970 --> 01:04:47,509
Anyone could have found out
about it real easily.

989
01:04:47,591 --> 01:04:49,639
Khanna, don't try to act smart.

990
01:04:49,679 --> 01:04:53,326
I might be a doctor,
whose occupation is to heal people

991
01:04:53,612 --> 01:04:57,013
but I am also capable
of making your life miserable.

992
01:04:57,052 --> 01:04:59,593
So, are you going to kill me?
- Yes.

993
01:04:59,716 --> 01:05:01,763
I am capable of killing you.

994
01:05:01,805 --> 01:05:03,771
I am ready to pay you Rs. 50 lakhs

995
01:05:03,852 --> 01:05:06,352
for telling me that secret.
- Good.

996
01:05:06,474 --> 01:05:09,136
But how much are you going
to pay me

997
01:05:09,178 --> 01:05:10,323
for keeping your secret?

998
01:05:10,898 --> 01:05:11,962
Which secret?

999
01:05:17,042 --> 01:05:17,983
This secret!

1000
01:05:20,277 --> 01:05:23,390
Mathur, I am not an idiot

1001
01:05:23,432 --> 01:05:26,013
that you can take advantage of me.

1002
01:05:26,052 --> 01:05:27,035
Bye!

1003
01:05:29,207 --> 01:05:31,911
What do we do now?
What if he tells my husband?

1004
01:05:32,156 --> 01:05:33,877
Don't worry about him.

1005
01:05:34,695 --> 01:05:38,095
I will deal with him.

1006
01:05:52,226 --> 01:05:53,169
Who is it?

1007
01:05:53,209 --> 01:05:56,241
My name is Khanna.
- How does that concern me?

1008
01:05:56,281 --> 01:05:58,247
It does concern you, Mangtaram.

1009
01:05:58,985 --> 01:06:03,860
You might not know me
but I know you very well.

1010
01:06:14,551 --> 01:06:18,400
If your son, Suraj,
dares to meet Roshni again

1011
01:06:18,810 --> 01:06:21,390
I will tell her
the truth about him.

1012
01:06:26,797 --> 01:06:31,917
You won't be alive
to do that, Khanna.

1013
01:08:48,971 --> 01:08:50,118
Go away!

1014
01:09:38,984 --> 01:09:40,048
What happened?

1015
01:09:40,090 --> 01:09:42,629
Ms. Roshni hasn't eaten anything
for two days now.

1016
01:09:50,125 --> 01:09:51,272
Roshni.

1017
01:09:53,565 --> 01:09:57,662
Dear, how long are you going
to starve yourself?

1018
01:09:59,259 --> 01:10:00,653
Do you think

1019
01:10:00,734 --> 01:10:03,805
that I feel happy
to see you in this state?

1020
01:10:06,305 --> 01:10:09,254
You'll understand my point
when you become a parent.

1021
01:10:10,155 --> 01:10:14,496
A mother suffers immensely
when her child is in pain.

1022
01:10:15,521 --> 01:10:17,979
Please get up, Roshni.
Get up!

1023
01:10:18,510 --> 01:10:19,903
Roshni.

1024
01:10:20,437 --> 01:10:21,705
Roshni!

1025
01:10:21,788 --> 01:10:23,589
You!
- Yes, it's me.

1026
01:10:23,713 --> 01:10:25,023
Where is Roshni?

1027
01:10:26,293 --> 01:10:28,627
Roshni went to her lover's house.

1028
01:11:14,913 --> 01:11:19,665
"Today, I've understood"

1029
01:11:19,746 --> 01:11:24,989
"the meaning of love. "

1030
01:11:25,195 --> 01:11:29,742
"Today, I've understood"

1031
01:11:29,782 --> 01:11:34,697
"the meaning of love. "

1032
01:11:34,861 --> 01:11:39,941
"If I don't meet you for a day. . "

1033
01:11:40,022 --> 01:11:44,773
"If I don't meet you for a day"

1034
01:11:44,856 --> 01:11:50,467
"I go insane. "

1035
01:11:50,509 --> 01:11:54,972
"Today, I realised"

1036
01:11:55,055 --> 01:11:59,971
"the meaning of love. "

1037
01:12:00,297 --> 01:12:05,049
"If I don't get to meet you
even for a day. . "

1038
01:12:05,294 --> 01:12:09,924
"If I don't get to meet you
even for a day"

1039
01:12:10,210 --> 01:12:13,200
"I start behaving"

1040
01:12:13,610 --> 01:12:15,739
"like those
who are crazily in love. "

1041
01:12:15,822 --> 01:12:20,327
"Today, I realised"

1042
01:12:20,615 --> 01:12:25,201
"what love is. "

1043
01:12:56,865 --> 01:13:01,492
"There's a slight anguish
in my heart. "

1044
01:13:02,066 --> 01:13:06,653
"You know that
and even I am aware of it. "

1045
01:13:11,979 --> 01:13:16,689
"Upon seeing your beautiful face"

1046
01:13:16,852 --> 01:13:21,891
"I have forgotten this world. "

1047
01:13:23,734 --> 01:13:28,485
"When we lose our heart
to someone. . "

1048
01:13:28,691 --> 01:13:33,564
"When we lose our heart
to someone"

1049
01:13:33,646 --> 01:13:36,678
"then we feel ready"

1050
01:13:36,924 --> 01:13:39,176
"to die for that person. "

1051
01:13:39,259 --> 01:13:43,560
"Today, I realised"

1052
01:13:43,928 --> 01:13:48,761
"what love is. "

1053
01:13:49,212 --> 01:13:53,636
"Today, I realised"

1054
01:13:53,963 --> 01:13:58,755
"what love is. "

1055
01:14:24,642 --> 01:14:29,517
"I'll kiss your beautiful lips'

1056
01:14:29,844 --> 01:14:34,556
"and fill your breath
with my fragrance. "

1057
01:14:39,797 --> 01:14:44,590
"Come on, let me go. "

1058
01:14:44,877 --> 01:14:46,924
"My gaze is lowered"

1059
01:14:47,293 --> 01:14:49,382
"because I am feeling shy. "

1060
01:14:51,553 --> 01:14:56,223
"My heart skips a beat. . "

1061
01:14:56,429 --> 01:15:01,056
"My heart skips a beat"

1062
01:15:01,179 --> 01:15:04,416
"when you look lovingly"

1063
01:15:04,701 --> 01:15:06,790
"at me. "

1064
01:15:06,873 --> 01:15:11,337
"Today, I realised"

1065
01:15:11,624 --> 01:15:16,335
"what love is. "

1066
01:15:16,989 --> 01:15:21,250
"Today, I realised"

1067
01:15:21,536 --> 01:15:26,452
"what love is. "

1068
01:15:26,615 --> 01:15:31,450
"If I don't get to meet you
even for a day. . "

1069
01:15:31,613 --> 01:15:36,323
"If I don't get to meet you
even for a day. . "

1070
01:15:36,446 --> 01:15:39,477
"I start behaving"

1071
01:15:39,846 --> 01:15:42,017
"like those
who are crazily in love. . "

1072
01:15:42,140 --> 01:15:46,319
"Today, I realised"

1073
01:15:46,727 --> 01:15:51,519
"what love is. . "

1074
01:15:52,052 --> 01:15:56,395
"Today, I realised"

1075
01:15:56,721 --> 01:16:01,882
"what love is. . "

1076
01:17:09,181 --> 01:17:11,721
Are you the one who
had made the call? - Yes.

1077
01:17:11,721 --> 01:17:14,670
Where is the dead body?
- Follow me.

1078
01:17:37,239 --> 01:17:38,672
Sir, a lighter. .

1079
01:17:39,655 --> 01:17:43,137
Don't touch anything.
- Why, sir?

1080
01:17:43,260 --> 01:17:45,594
Otherwise, the fingerprints
of the murderer

1081
01:17:45,676 --> 01:17:48,011
will get erased.
- Oh, my God!

1082
01:17:48,380 --> 01:17:51,616
Are you an inspector
from the British era?

1083
01:17:51,698 --> 01:17:53,664
Idiot!

1084
01:17:54,442 --> 01:17:56,531
I am totally Indian.

1085
01:17:56,654 --> 01:18:00,053
I hate people who still follow
the British style.

1086
01:18:27,539 --> 01:18:30,159
My name is Inspector
Rambhajan Singh.

1087
01:18:30,611 --> 01:18:33,272
Thank you, Inspector.
- No need to thank me.

1088
01:18:33,272 --> 01:18:35,198
Because this lighter
belongs to you.

1089
01:18:35,730 --> 01:18:37,247
But how did this end up with you?

1090
01:18:37,615 --> 01:18:40,359
Even I can't tell you that.
Only he can explain it.

1091
01:18:40,810 --> 01:18:42,980
Banke Laal, what is his name?

1092
01:18:43,022 --> 01:18:45,971
Satish Ganna.
No, I mean Khanna. - Yes, he.

1093
01:18:46,666 --> 01:18:48,306
But he is no more
in this world.

1094
01:18:48,592 --> 01:18:50,149
He has left for his
heavenly abode.

1095
01:18:50,641 --> 01:18:53,590
Is Khanna dead?
- He has been murdered.

1096
01:18:54,244 --> 01:18:58,137
And your lighter was found
near his dead body.

1097
01:18:59,528 --> 01:19:04,484
Doctor, why did you kill him?
Tell me.

1098
01:19:05,222 --> 01:19:08,662
I am not in a hurry.
Think well before answering me.

1099
01:19:09,768 --> 01:19:11,079
Banke Laal.
- Yes?

1100
01:19:11,571 --> 01:19:13,497
In the meanwhile,
get a handcuff of his size.

1101
01:19:13,823 --> 01:19:15,954
Okay.
- Hail India.

1102
01:19:24,433 --> 01:19:28,201
Hello. - It is me, Dr. Mathur.
- You! Why have you called now?

1103
01:19:28,323 --> 01:19:30,412
He is at home.
If he comes to know of it

1104
01:19:30,454 --> 01:19:33,772
then I'll be in trouble.
- I am in trouble now.

1105
01:19:33,853 --> 01:19:34,918
Why? What happened?

1106
01:19:34,959 --> 01:19:36,679
That inspector has got a suspicion

1107
01:19:36,802 --> 01:19:39,383
that I have murdered Khanna.
- Hang up now.

1108
01:19:39,751 --> 01:19:40,734
I'll come to meet you

1109
01:19:40,776 --> 01:19:42,168
in the evening
after making some excuse.

1110
01:19:57,528 --> 01:19:59,740
Who had called?
- It was my friend, Sangeeta.

1111
01:20:00,027 --> 01:20:01,870
Sangeeta?
- You don't know her.

1112
01:20:02,075 --> 01:20:04,041
That poor lady has been sick
for a couple of days.

1113
01:20:04,124 --> 01:20:06,744
I am thinking of visiting her
this evening. - Okay.

1114
01:20:06,827 --> 01:20:07,891
You should definitely visit her.

1115
01:20:08,710 --> 01:20:11,128
You never know when someone
might breathe their last.

1116
01:20:12,069 --> 01:20:14,896
But you will get bored
being alone at home, right?

1117
01:20:15,141 --> 01:20:16,452
Even I forgot to tell you.

1118
01:20:17,312 --> 01:20:19,892
One of my friend from college days
has got transferred to this city.

1119
01:20:20,876 --> 01:20:23,171
I am going to meet him
this evening. - Oh!

1120
01:20:23,210 --> 01:20:27,061
I'll return late in the night.
Don't wait for me.

1121
01:20:27,103 --> 01:20:29,846
Oh! Okay, darling. Bye.
- Bye.

1122
01:20:47,664 --> 01:20:50,819
What?
I am coming.

1123
01:21:20,637 --> 01:21:22,522
Sir, whoever the murderer is. . 
- Yes.

1124
01:21:22,562 --> 01:21:23,668
... he is very cruel.

1125
01:21:23,751 --> 01:21:25,963
Yes.
- He has stabbed both of them

1126
01:21:26,044 --> 01:21:27,929
with a sharp weapon.
- Yes.

1127
01:21:35,137 --> 01:21:36,408
Banke Laal.
- Yes.

1128
01:21:36,980 --> 01:21:39,561
You are partially right.

1129
01:21:39,643 --> 01:21:40,709
How is that?

1130
01:21:41,977 --> 01:21:44,107
What is this?
- A bullet.

1131
01:21:44,312 --> 01:21:45,295
A bullet!

1132
01:21:45,951 --> 01:21:49,802
It means that these two
have not only been stabbed

1133
01:21:49,965 --> 01:21:51,603
but also been shot.

1134
01:21:52,014 --> 01:21:53,528
Yes. - Did you understand,
blabbermouth? - Yes.

1135
01:22:03,319 --> 01:22:04,425
Sir, if you promise
not to hit me

1136
01:22:04,506 --> 01:22:05,531
then I want
to tell you something.

1137
01:22:05,571 --> 01:22:07,332
Actually, I'm a bit confused.

1138
01:22:07,701 --> 01:22:08,849
Go ahead.

1139
01:22:09,134 --> 01:22:12,535
I was partially right,
but you are completely wrong.

1140
01:22:12,739 --> 01:22:15,401
Banke Laal!
- Please don't feel upset, sir.

1141
01:22:15,770 --> 01:22:17,982
When the murderer had shot them,
why did he stab them?

1142
01:22:18,146 --> 01:22:19,908
And when he had stabbed them,
why did he shoot them?

1143
01:22:21,137 --> 01:22:25,109
Because there are two culprits

1144
01:22:26,175 --> 01:22:27,158
and not one.

1145
01:23:03,939 --> 01:23:05,783
Kalka Singh, it's you!

1146
01:23:05,946 --> 01:23:07,298
Yes, Jagatpal, it's me.

1147
01:23:07,586 --> 01:23:08,895
What were you doing?

1148
01:23:09,429 --> 01:23:10,616
I was watering the plants.

1149
01:23:10,658 --> 01:23:14,344
Were you watering the plants
or hiding the blood stains?

1150
01:23:16,679 --> 01:23:18,931
The person, whose hands
are already stained with blood

1151
01:23:19,628 --> 01:23:21,798
shouldn't accuse others.

1152
01:23:22,044 --> 01:23:25,116
You are absolutely right, sir.

1153
01:23:26,918 --> 01:23:31,711
One thief can't accuse
another thief of the theft.

1154
01:23:32,571 --> 01:23:33,841
What if he's a thief?

1155
01:23:34,168 --> 01:23:36,052
There are certain rules
to be followed.

1156
01:23:36,217 --> 01:23:38,798
Inspector, do you know
whom you are talking to?

1157
01:23:38,961 --> 01:23:40,313
I know!

1158
01:23:41,010 --> 01:23:45,188
I'm talking to Kalka Singh
and advocate, Jagatpal Sharma

1159
01:23:45,679 --> 01:23:47,726
who went missing 18 years ago

1160
01:23:48,177 --> 01:23:51,659
after sentencing Mr. Mohanlal's
murderer, Rakabh Singh

1161
01:23:51,781 --> 01:23:53,421
to imprisonment.

1162
01:23:56,247 --> 01:23:59,769
Even the police department
had closed that file.

1163
01:24:00,711 --> 01:24:05,217
But after 14 years, Rakabh Singh
was killed in a truck accident

1164
01:24:05,463 --> 01:24:08,329
as soon as he was released.

1165
01:24:08,412 --> 01:24:09,558
Not only that.

1166
01:24:09,845 --> 01:24:15,088
The truck driver who killed him
was also murdered.

1167
01:24:15,252 --> 01:24:19,020
So, the government
handed over that file to me

1168
01:24:19,307 --> 01:24:20,986
and I'm here!

1169
01:24:21,684 --> 01:24:24,959
Even before I could begin
the investigation

1170
01:24:25,164 --> 01:24:29,260
your friends, Dr. Mathur
and Mr. Khanna were murdered.

1171
01:24:30,735 --> 01:24:33,520
I suspect that these murders
were being carried out

1172
01:24:33,889 --> 01:24:38,272
for the wealth that went missing
from Mr. Mohanlal's safe.

1173
01:24:39,256 --> 01:24:42,082
One among you four
is definitely the culprit.

1174
01:24:42,573 --> 01:24:44,989
Two of them were killed,
and you both are alive.

1175
01:24:46,341 --> 01:24:49,167
Be careful with each other.

1176
01:24:54,697 --> 01:24:58,342
I'm having fun!
I'm having fun in life!

1177
01:24:58,998 --> 01:25:02,726
Scoundrels! They were planning
to ruin my son's life.

1178
01:25:03,135 --> 01:25:06,739
Both of them got killed.

1179
01:25:07,927 --> 01:25:09,033
That scoundrel, Khanna!

1180
01:25:09,074 --> 01:25:10,671
He used to say that. .

1181
01:25:10,959 --> 01:25:14,194
'Don't take me lightly. '

1182
01:25:14,523 --> 01:25:17,595
But I got rid of him easily.

1183
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:20,052
And that scoundrel, doctor!

1184
01:25:20,502 --> 01:25:22,591
He used to take shelter
in others house

1185
01:25:22,633 --> 01:25:24,722
and he tried to set
my house on fire.

1186
01:25:25,336 --> 01:25:28,654
At last, there was no one
to perform his last rites.

1187
01:25:58,883 --> 01:26:00,561
Sir, if you want
to take a stroll

1188
01:26:00,603 --> 01:26:02,201
why don't you go to a ground?

1189
01:26:02,527 --> 01:26:04,452
Why are you walking here?

1190
01:26:04,658 --> 01:26:08,507
I'm not taking a stroll
but pondering.

1191
01:26:08,549 --> 01:26:10,802
Then why don't you
sit in a place and think?

1192
01:26:10,842 --> 01:26:11,948
The rattling noise
from your shoes

1193
01:26:11,989 --> 01:26:13,341
is disturbing my sleep.

1194
01:26:13,506 --> 01:26:15,061
You moron!

1195
01:26:15,799 --> 01:26:18,175
Have you come here
to work or to sleep?

1196
01:26:18,256 --> 01:26:21,493
Ever since you joined
our department

1197
01:26:21,779 --> 01:26:24,769
neither the murderers
are getting any sleep nor you.

1198
01:26:25,302 --> 01:26:27,637
The murderer is on a killing spree
and I am dying of this suspense.

1199
01:26:27,718 --> 01:26:29,766
Hey!
You idiot!

1200
01:26:45,986 --> 01:26:48,567
Fool!
He's sleeping like a log!

1201
01:26:56,554 --> 01:26:58,357
Hey, you!
- Yes, sir?

1202
01:26:58,603 --> 01:27:00,036
Tell Shakuntala Devi

1203
01:27:00,078 --> 01:27:02,616
that Inspector Rambhajan Singh
is here to meet her. Go!

1204
01:27:02,739 --> 01:27:03,764
Yes, sir.

1205
01:27:17,567 --> 01:27:20,722
How may I help you, Inspector?

1206
01:27:21,213 --> 01:27:22,605
I was passing by.

1207
01:27:22,646 --> 01:27:24,080
So, I thought,
I would meet you on the way.

1208
01:27:24,858 --> 01:27:28,872
This is Mr. Mohanlal's
photograph, right?

1209
01:27:31,493 --> 01:27:33,460
Yes, but why do you
want to know it?

1210
01:27:33,501 --> 01:27:35,630
The job of being a police officer
is strange.

1211
01:27:35,917 --> 01:27:38,252
We have the habit
of digging the past.

1212
01:27:38,621 --> 01:27:39,808
I didn't get you.

1213
01:27:40,218 --> 01:27:42,472
Even I don't seem
to understand.

1214
01:27:42,963 --> 01:27:46,281
I'm trying to find the link
between the clues.

1215
01:27:47,468 --> 01:27:48,656
What are you talking about?

1216
01:27:49,762 --> 01:27:53,940
About 18 years ago,
Rakabh Singh, a driver

1217
01:27:55,046 --> 01:27:59,142
was nabbed for murdering
his boss, Mr. Mohanlal.

1218
01:28:01,027 --> 01:28:04,548
He was accused of asking
Rs. 500 from his boss

1219
01:28:04,591 --> 01:28:06,474
for his wife's treatment.

1220
01:28:07,580 --> 01:28:09,875
When his boss refused
to give him the money

1221
01:28:10,775 --> 01:28:12,455
he killed him.

1222
01:28:13,232 --> 01:28:15,116
And he was sentenced
to be imprisoned for 14 years.

1223
01:28:16,919 --> 01:28:18,147
Tell me something.

1224
01:28:18,762 --> 01:28:22,285
Where were you
when your husband was killed?

1225
01:28:23,146 --> 01:28:24,210
I was at my parents' house

1226
01:28:24,866 --> 01:28:26,626
because I was pregnant with Roshni.

1227
01:28:27,650 --> 01:28:30,108
I didn't even see
that traitor's face.

1228
01:28:31,133 --> 01:28:33,139
I wish, he had come
in front of me.

1229
01:28:33,631 --> 01:28:35,146
I would have killed him!

1230
01:28:35,434 --> 01:28:38,177
I regret that your wish

1231
01:28:38,956 --> 01:28:41,249
can't be fulfilled in this life.

1232
01:28:42,396 --> 01:28:44,976
Because when Rakabh Singh
was released from the prison

1233
01:28:45,019 --> 01:28:47,968
after completing
the sentence of 14 years

1234
01:28:49,114 --> 01:28:52,800
he was killed in a truck accident.
- What?

1235
01:28:53,129 --> 01:28:54,889
Yes, Shakuntala Devi.

1236
01:28:55,626 --> 01:28:59,067
Mr. Mohanlal's murder file

1237
01:28:59,804 --> 01:29:02,057
which was now ages old

1238
01:29:03,532 --> 01:29:05,540
was handed over to me
after 14 years.

1239
01:29:06,727 --> 01:29:08,938
Because that truck driver

1240
01:29:09,472 --> 01:29:12,748
who had killed Rakabh Singh

1241
01:29:13,527 --> 01:29:15,287
was also murdered.

1242
01:29:17,377 --> 01:29:18,646
Don't be astonished.

1243
01:29:18,934 --> 01:29:21,964
In the grief
of losing your husband

1244
01:29:22,046 --> 01:29:25,447
you have forgotten
that jewellery worth Rs. 20 lakhs

1245
01:29:25,487 --> 01:29:29,214
were stolen from your husband's
safe on the same day.

1246
01:29:29,419 --> 01:29:31,753
Yes, but the police said
that the jewellery

1247
01:29:31,794 --> 01:29:34,826
couldn't be recovered
from Rakabh Singh. - Correct!

1248
01:29:35,194 --> 01:29:38,595
If the jewellery couldn't
be recovered from Rakabh Singh

1249
01:29:38,799 --> 01:29:40,355
then where is it?

1250
01:29:40,888 --> 01:29:44,410
Where did it disappear
without any trace? - Inspector!

1251
01:29:44,451 --> 01:29:48,384
I hope, the jewellery wasn't
taken away from the safe

1252
01:29:48,426 --> 01:29:50,800
before he was murdered.

1253
01:29:51,701 --> 01:29:54,201
Once Rakabh Singh
was released from the jail

1254
01:29:54,324 --> 01:29:56,248
the culprit might have got scared

1255
01:29:56,493 --> 01:29:58,788
that the truth will be revealed.

1256
01:29:59,485 --> 01:30:02,146
And hence,
Rakabh Singh was murdered.

1257
01:30:02,189 --> 01:30:04,646
Inspector,
are you in your senses?

1258
01:30:04,892 --> 01:30:06,939
Do you know what you are saying
and whom you are talking to?

1259
01:30:07,595 --> 01:30:11,773
I think, I troubled you.

1260
01:30:13,451 --> 01:30:16,442
It's my responsibility
to tell this to you.

1261
01:30:17,711 --> 01:30:22,381
Dr. Mathur, Mr. Khanna
and Mrs. Jagatpal's murder

1262
01:30:22,422 --> 01:30:24,388
is not a coincidence.

1263
01:30:25,617 --> 01:30:29,672
These murders are linked
to your husband's death.

1264
01:30:30,983 --> 01:30:32,744
Please be careful.

1265
01:30:33,686 --> 01:30:36,963
By the way,
who else stays with you?

1266
01:30:37,045 --> 01:30:38,315
Hello, Aunt!

1267
01:30:39,421 --> 01:30:41,673
He's Chunnu, my brother's son.

1268
01:30:41,879 --> 01:30:44,091
Greetings!
- Greetings!

1269
01:30:44,540 --> 01:30:45,974
And my daughter, Roshni.

1270
01:30:47,367 --> 01:30:49,292
I didn't get to see
your daughter.

1271
01:30:50,358 --> 01:30:51,710
Where is she?

1272
01:31:55,608 --> 01:31:58,557
"I am a lover. "

1273
01:32:02,775 --> 01:32:05,193
"I am a wanderer. "

1274
01:32:09,574 --> 01:32:14,163
"I am a lover
and a wanderer. "

1275
01:32:14,655 --> 01:32:18,710
"I am lovesick. "

1276
01:32:18,832 --> 01:32:20,880
"I want to love you
the whole day. "

1277
01:32:21,044 --> 01:32:23,091
"My job is to love. "

1278
01:32:23,256 --> 01:32:25,345
"I want to love you
the whole day. "

1279
01:32:25,549 --> 01:32:27,761
"My job is to love. "

1280
01:32:27,884 --> 01:32:32,472
"I'm a bit mad and a bit crazy. "

1281
01:32:32,595 --> 01:32:35,257
"You are a lover. "

1282
01:32:39,231 --> 01:32:42,138
"You are a wanderer. "

1283
01:32:46,316 --> 01:32:50,782
"You are a lover and a wanderer. "

1284
01:32:51,150 --> 01:32:54,959
"You are lovesick. "

1285
01:32:55,123 --> 01:32:57,211
"You want to love me
the whole day. "

1286
01:32:57,294 --> 01:32:59,464
"Your job is to love. "

1287
01:32:59,669 --> 01:33:01,799
"You want to love me
the whole day. "

1288
01:33:01,964 --> 01:33:04,176
"Your job is to love. "

1289
01:33:04,257 --> 01:33:08,968
"You are a bit mad
and a bit crazy. "

1290
01:33:09,049 --> 01:33:13,309
"I am a lover. . "

1291
01:33:13,392 --> 01:33:16,095
"I am a lover. "

1292
01:33:43,947 --> 01:33:48,453
"I sneak away from my house
to meet you. "

1293
01:33:48,617 --> 01:33:52,960
"I make so many excuses. "

1294
01:33:53,245 --> 01:33:57,423
"I don't believe
in keeping my love hidden. "

1295
01:33:57,669 --> 01:34:02,176
"I am a lover,
I am not scared of anyone. "

1296
01:34:06,803 --> 01:34:11,186
"I sneak away from my house
to meet you. "

1297
01:34:11,269 --> 01:34:15,693
"I make so many excuses. "

1298
01:34:15,897 --> 01:34:20,320
"I don't believe
in keeping my love hidden. "

1299
01:34:20,443 --> 01:34:24,417
"I am a lover,
I am not scared of anyone. "

1300
01:34:24,498 --> 01:34:26,587
"My heart is beating. "

1301
01:34:26,710 --> 01:34:28,635
"Let it beat. "

1302
01:34:28,922 --> 01:34:31,093
"Something might happen. "

1303
01:34:31,216 --> 01:34:33,511
"Let it happen. "

1304
01:34:37,852 --> 01:34:42,235
"You are the blinding light
and I am the moth attracted to it. "

1305
01:34:42,521 --> 01:34:44,651
"I am a lover. "

1306
01:34:44,856 --> 01:34:46,782
"I am a wanderer. "

1307
01:34:47,313 --> 01:34:51,206
"I am lovesick. "

1308
01:34:51,287 --> 01:34:53,334
"I want to love you
the whole day. "

1309
01:34:53,498 --> 01:34:55,587
"My job is to love. "

1310
01:34:55,792 --> 01:34:57,881
"I want to love you
the whole day. "

1311
01:34:57,964 --> 01:35:00,134
"My job is to love. "

1312
01:35:00,257 --> 01:35:04,762
"I am a bit mad and a bit crazy. "

1313
01:35:04,927 --> 01:35:09,596
"You are a lover. . "

1314
01:35:09,719 --> 01:35:12,054
"You are a lover. "

1315
01:35:54,735 --> 01:35:59,076
"I am at peace
when I meet you, my love. "

1316
01:35:59,405 --> 01:36:03,500
"For my sake,
please come closer to me. "

1317
01:36:03,951 --> 01:36:08,047
"How can I come close to you?
I am scared. "

1318
01:36:08,210 --> 01:36:12,470
"The sun is about to set.
Now, let me go home. "

1319
01:36:17,100 --> 01:36:21,236
"I am at peace
when I meet you, my love. "

1320
01:36:21,523 --> 01:36:25,618
"For my sake,
please come closer to me. "

1321
01:36:25,947 --> 01:36:30,206
"How can I come close to you?
I am scared. "

1322
01:36:30,288 --> 01:36:34,138
"The sun is about to set.
Now, let me go home. "

1323
01:36:34,220 --> 01:36:36,146
"How can I let you go?"

1324
01:36:36,269 --> 01:36:38,398
"It is necessary. "

1325
01:36:38,521 --> 01:36:40,570
"I will be heart-broken. "

1326
01:36:40,651 --> 01:36:43,314
"I am helpless. "

1327
01:36:47,246 --> 01:36:51,670
"I will to come to your house
as your bride. "

1328
01:36:51,956 --> 01:36:54,168
"You are a lover. "

1329
01:36:54,250 --> 01:36:56,339
"You are a wanderer. "

1330
01:36:56,708 --> 01:37:00,312
"You are lovesick. "

1331
01:37:00,435 --> 01:37:02,524
"You want to love me
the whole day. "

1332
01:37:02,647 --> 01:37:04,818
"Your job is to love. "

1333
01:37:04,940 --> 01:37:06,907
"You want to love me
the whole day. "

1334
01:37:07,030 --> 01:37:09,079
"Your job is to love. "

1335
01:37:09,242 --> 01:37:13,788
"You are a bit mad
and a bit crazy. "

1336
01:37:13,911 --> 01:37:15,837
"I am a lover. "

1337
01:37:16,041 --> 01:37:18,007
"I am a wanderer. "

1338
01:37:18,541 --> 01:37:22,308
"I am lovesick. "

1339
01:37:22,390 --> 01:37:24,520
"I want to love you
the whole day. "

1340
01:37:24,685 --> 01:37:26,651
"My job is to love. "

1341
01:37:26,773 --> 01:37:28,821
"I want to love you
the whole day. "

1342
01:37:28,902 --> 01:37:31,075
"My job is to love. "

1343
01:37:31,155 --> 01:37:35,579
"I'm a bit mad and a bit crazy. "

1344
01:37:35,784 --> 01:37:39,880
"I am a lover. . "

1345
01:37:40,168 --> 01:37:44,468
"I am a lover. . "

1346
01:37:44,549 --> 01:37:47,295
"I am a lover. "

1347
01:37:54,831 --> 01:37:55,732
You?

1348
01:37:56,715 --> 01:37:57,863
What are you doing here?

1349
01:38:00,606 --> 01:38:02,449
It would be better
if you ask this question

1350
01:38:02,695 --> 01:38:03,842
to your mother.

1351
01:38:05,931 --> 01:38:06,833
Mom!

1352
01:38:08,102 --> 01:38:09,003
Mom!

1353
01:38:09,414 --> 01:38:10,274
Mom. .

1354
01:38:11,871 --> 01:38:12,894
Greetings.

1355
01:38:15,066 --> 01:38:18,753
Roshni, I have fixed
your marriage with Sikander.

1356
01:38:18,875 --> 01:38:21,168
But, Mom, I love Suraj. . 
- You know very well

1357
01:38:21,250 --> 01:38:23,462
that I don't change my decisions.

1358
01:38:25,961 --> 01:38:27,394
Then you should also know

1359
01:38:28,254 --> 01:38:29,566
that I am your daughter.

1360
01:38:29,935 --> 01:38:31,613
Even I don't change
my decisions.

1361
01:38:32,432 --> 01:38:36,733
I would rather die
than live without Suraj.

1362
01:38:42,223 --> 01:38:43,287
Get out of my way.

1363
01:38:43,820 --> 01:38:44,720
Move!

1364
01:38:45,541 --> 01:38:49,881
Your life is precious to me.
So, I won't kill you.

1365
01:38:51,439 --> 01:38:53,651
But if you refuse to listen
to your mother

1366
01:38:54,511 --> 01:38:58,360
then I will kill the one
who is precious to you.

1367
01:39:02,088 --> 01:39:05,610
Abdul, this revolver
has six bullets.

1368
01:39:07,291 --> 01:39:09,502
If my wife-to-be
steps outside the house

1369
01:39:09,583 --> 01:39:11,837
before the wedding

1370
01:39:12,206 --> 01:39:15,318
put all the six bullets
in Suraj's heart.

1371
01:39:20,274 --> 01:39:22,609
So, Mrs. Roshni Sikander Khanna

1372
01:39:23,346 --> 01:39:25,517
if you still want to go out,
you may.

1373
01:39:25,969 --> 01:39:27,401
No one will stop you.

1374
01:39:27,852 --> 01:39:29,532
Are these people stopping you?
Hey, move.

1375
01:39:29,572 --> 01:39:30,678
Move aside. .

1376
01:39:30,761 --> 01:39:32,152
Go.
Please, go.

1377
01:39:35,716 --> 01:39:36,740
Go.

1378
01:39:38,748 --> 01:39:41,533
Sikander, you have won
this round.

1379
01:39:42,475 --> 01:39:44,318
Take your men
and return day after tomorrow

1380
01:39:44,441 --> 01:39:46,079
with the wedding procession.

1381
01:39:46,407 --> 01:39:47,677
Thank you.
Come on, guys.

1382
01:39:54,312 --> 01:39:56,893
This is not just an invite
to Roshni's wedding

1383
01:39:56,975 --> 01:40:01,685
this is Shakuntala Devi's
call for war against us.

1384
01:40:02,342 --> 01:40:04,308
If my blood flows in your veins

1385
01:40:04,389 --> 01:40:06,520
then go and kidnap her daughter.

1386
01:40:06,600 --> 01:40:07,911
I'll take care
of the rest. Go!

1387
01:40:17,702 --> 01:40:18,848
Hey, where do you think
you are going?

1388
01:40:41,418 --> 01:40:42,359
Roshni.

1389
01:40:44,284 --> 01:40:45,185
Suraj.

1390
01:40:45,308 --> 01:40:46,250
Suraj!

1391
01:40:49,486 --> 01:40:52,109
Suraj. . 
- Roshni, I am here

1392
01:40:52,190 --> 01:40:53,952
to take you somewhere far.

1393
01:40:54,237 --> 01:40:55,712
Really, Suraj?
- Yes.

1394
01:41:11,647 --> 01:41:14,104
Chunnu, shoot this bastard!

1395
01:41:15,742 --> 01:41:17,708
I will shoot
every single bastard

1396
01:41:17,791 --> 01:41:18,897
who dares to come between them.

1397
01:41:19,020 --> 01:41:21,108
Chunnu!
- Shut up, you old hag.

1398
01:41:21,232 --> 01:41:22,378
Do you think

1399
01:41:22,500 --> 01:41:24,466
you have bought my loyalty
by offering two meals a day?

1400
01:41:26,147 --> 01:41:29,423
Roshni, my dear,
you should run away with Suraj.

1401
01:41:29,914 --> 01:41:31,757
You will get truckloads
of money in this house

1402
01:41:31,881 --> 01:41:34,829
but you will find love
only with Suraj.

1403
01:41:35,240 --> 01:41:37,000
Go, my dear.
Go with him.

1404
01:41:39,541 --> 01:41:40,933
Chunnu. . 
- It's okay.

1405
01:42:03,666 --> 01:42:05,509
Inspector Rambhajan speaking.

1406
01:42:05,715 --> 01:42:08,581
This is Shakuntala Devi.
- Yes, tell me.

1407
01:42:09,236 --> 01:42:11,039
How can I help you?

1408
01:42:11,244 --> 01:42:13,825
A ruffian has fled
with my daughter.

1409
01:42:14,194 --> 01:42:16,322
What is his name?
- Suraj.

1410
01:42:16,486 --> 01:42:20,050
Oh, that guy.
Son of Mangtaram, right?

1411
01:42:20,255 --> 01:42:23,122
Yes, he's the one.
- No way, ma'am.

1412
01:42:23,450 --> 01:42:27,504
You must be mistaken.
He can't do such a thing.

1413
01:42:27,792 --> 01:42:31,723
He is so naive that he
can't even flee on his own

1414
01:42:31,806 --> 01:42:33,567
let alone flee
with your daughter.

1415
01:42:34,386 --> 01:42:38,113
I think that your daughter
has eloped with him.

1416
01:42:38,236 --> 01:42:40,859
Inspector, do you even know
who you are talking to?

1417
01:42:41,431 --> 01:42:43,971
I want my daughter
in next 24 hours

1418
01:42:44,094 --> 01:42:45,445
and that boy should be locked up
in the jail.

1419
01:42:45,568 --> 01:42:48,763
Why are you screaming
so loud at this age?

1420
01:42:48,886 --> 01:42:50,770
Talk softly.
You may fall short of breath.

1421
01:42:50,852 --> 01:42:52,818
Shut up!
- Excuse me, ma'am!

1422
01:42:52,941 --> 01:42:55,522
I am a servant
of the Government of India

1423
01:42:55,644 --> 01:42:57,406
and not a servant
at your house. .

1424
01:42:58,062 --> 01:43:00,765
Hey. . Nonsense.

1425
01:43:03,140 --> 01:43:04,206
Hey, Banke Laal.

1426
01:43:04,656 --> 01:43:07,441
Come with me.
Let's see what Suraj is up to.

1427
01:44:03,147 --> 01:44:10,275
"I can't live without you
even for a moment. "

1428
01:44:10,643 --> 01:44:14,126
"I will go crazy in love"

1429
01:44:14,207 --> 01:44:17,690
"without you. "

1430
01:44:18,550 --> 01:44:22,113
"Without you. "

1431
01:44:22,236 --> 01:44:25,471
"Without you. "

1432
01:44:25,677 --> 01:44:32,147
"Without you. . "

1433
01:44:32,393 --> 01:44:39,439
"I can't live without you
even for a moment. "

1434
01:44:39,602 --> 01:44:43,207
"I will go crazy in love"

1435
01:44:43,372 --> 01:44:47,098
"without you. "

1436
01:44:47,754 --> 01:44:54,554
"Without you. . "

1437
01:44:54,800 --> 01:44:58,280
"Without you. "

1438
01:44:58,444 --> 01:45:01,516
"Without you. "

1439
01:45:37,808 --> 01:45:40,920
"You are my world. "

1440
01:45:41,003 --> 01:45:44,812
"I worship you. "

1441
01:45:45,181 --> 01:45:51,979
"My life is incomplete
without you. "

1442
01:45:52,471 --> 01:45:59,067
"My life is incomplete
without you. "

1443
01:46:00,090 --> 01:46:02,916
"My life. "

1444
01:46:03,449 --> 01:46:07,380
"How shall I, your beloved, live. . "

1445
01:46:11,478 --> 01:46:15,041
"Without you. "

1446
01:46:15,164 --> 01:46:18,276
"Without you. "

1447
01:46:18,563 --> 01:46:22,003
"Without you. "

1448
01:46:22,085 --> 01:46:25,076
"Without you. "

1449
01:46:25,198 --> 01:46:32,162
"I can't live without you
even for a moment. "

1450
01:46:32,368 --> 01:46:35,889
"I will go crazy in love"

1451
01:46:35,971 --> 01:46:39,822
"without you. "

1452
01:46:40,436 --> 01:46:43,836
"Without you. "

1453
01:46:43,999 --> 01:46:47,153
"Without you. "

1454
01:46:47,399 --> 01:46:54,076
"Without you. . "

1455
01:47:33,766 --> 01:47:36,962
"You bring peace to my eyes. "

1456
01:47:37,535 --> 01:47:40,607
"You soothe my heart. "

1457
01:47:40,935 --> 01:47:48,021
"It's you who rules my heart. "

1458
01:47:48,308 --> 01:47:55,067
"It's you who rules my heart. "

1459
01:47:55,148 --> 01:47:58,670
"You are the one who rules it. "

1460
01:47:59,122 --> 01:48:03,135
"My heart will skip a beat"

1461
01:48:07,272 --> 01:48:10,754
"without you. "

1462
01:48:10,877 --> 01:48:14,153
"Without you. "

1463
01:48:14,317 --> 01:48:17,923
"Without you. "

1464
01:48:18,004 --> 01:48:20,953
"Without you. "

1465
01:48:21,118 --> 01:48:28,039
"I can't live without you
even for a moment. "

1466
01:48:28,162 --> 01:48:31,686
"I will go crazy in love"

1467
01:48:31,809 --> 01:48:35,372
"without you. "

1468
01:48:36,026 --> 01:48:39,508
"Without you. "

1469
01:48:39,590 --> 01:48:42,785
"Without you. "

1470
01:48:43,153 --> 01:48:46,717
"Without you. "

1471
01:48:46,840 --> 01:48:49,995
"Without you. "

1472
01:48:50,118 --> 01:48:53,353
"Without you. "

1473
01:48:53,558 --> 01:48:56,957
"Without you. "

1474
01:48:57,122 --> 01:49:00,603
"Without you. "

1475
01:49:00,686 --> 01:49:04,576
"Without you. "

1476
01:49:05,764 --> 01:49:09,450
"The Goddess of money. . "

1477
01:49:09,696 --> 01:49:13,259
"The Goddess of money. . "

1478
01:49:13,751 --> 01:49:17,356
"The Goddess of wealth. . "

1479
01:49:17,601 --> 01:49:21,247
"Please listen to my plea. . "

1480
01:49:21,944 --> 01:49:24,237
"The Goddess of money,
help me get rich. . "

1481
01:49:24,565 --> 01:49:26,736
Sir. . 
- "No matter what you do. . "

1482
01:49:26,982 --> 01:49:29,563
Sir, I think you are going
to get raided.

1483
01:49:30,381 --> 01:49:32,347
Sir!
- I have told you several times

1484
01:49:32,429 --> 01:49:34,724
not to interfere
with my prayers.

1485
01:49:34,847 --> 01:49:37,140
The Lord is at the door.
- Is it so?

1486
01:49:39,720 --> 01:49:40,908
He is not the God.

1487
01:49:41,605 --> 01:49:43,119
He is a police officer.
- They are the ones

1488
01:49:43,203 --> 01:49:45,495
who people worship these days.
- Is it so?

1489
01:49:45,537 --> 01:49:47,175
Yes.
- How are you?

1490
01:49:47,339 --> 01:49:49,141
Inspector, why did you take
the trouble?

1491
01:49:49,224 --> 01:49:50,861
You could have called for me
and I would have come to you.

1492
01:49:51,067 --> 01:49:52,991
I'm here for the same.

1493
01:49:53,114 --> 01:49:54,916
I'm here to take all of you
to the police station.

1494
01:49:55,940 --> 01:49:57,334
Dhaniram.
- Yes.

1495
01:49:57,457 --> 01:49:59,423
Is it 15th of August today?
Is he here to take me

1496
01:49:59,463 --> 01:50:01,758
for the flag hoisting?
- Sir. . - Yes?

1497
01:50:01,839 --> 01:50:04,788
It's not 15th of August today.
- Then? - It's 1st of April.

1498
01:50:05,567 --> 01:50:07,204
Where is Roshni?

1499
01:50:08,843 --> 01:50:10,728
Sir, I think he is blind.

1500
01:50:11,055 --> 01:50:12,857
Hey, stop whispering
amongst yourselves.

1501
01:50:13,389 --> 01:50:16,872
Just tell me where's
Ms. Shakuntala Devi's daughter

1502
01:50:17,567 --> 01:50:18,632
Roshni?

1503
01:50:18,715 --> 01:50:21,296
She must be at her own house.
But what's the problem?

1504
01:50:21,377 --> 01:50:24,162
A complaint has been made
against your son

1505
01:50:24,695 --> 01:50:27,725
that he has eloped
with Ms. Shakuntala Devi's daughter

1506
01:50:27,809 --> 01:50:30,021
who is a minor.
- That's not true.

1507
01:50:31,207 --> 01:50:33,501
Inspector, I'm an adult

1508
01:50:34,238 --> 01:50:36,245
and I came here
with Suraj willingly.

1509
01:50:36,368 --> 01:50:39,728
But your mom was saying. . 
- My mom has lied to you.

1510
01:50:41,080 --> 01:50:42,758
Actually, I love Suraj.

1511
01:50:43,373 --> 01:50:46,364
And my mom is forcing me
to marry Sikander.

1512
01:50:46,444 --> 01:50:48,370
So, that simply means

1513
01:50:49,559 --> 01:50:53,449
your mom is a villain
in your love story.

1514
01:50:55,211 --> 01:50:57,627
Do this, dear.
Go home right now.

1515
01:50:57,915 --> 01:51:01,110
What? - Only the cowards elope
to get married.

1516
01:51:02,296 --> 01:51:03,361
You are in love, aren't you?

1517
01:51:03,444 --> 01:51:05,779
So, even your wedding
will take place with pomp and show.

1518
01:51:06,720 --> 01:51:09,505
Suraj will come
to pick you up tomorrow.

1519
01:51:09,751 --> 01:51:10,898
Go home right now.

1520
01:51:11,677 --> 01:51:12,864
Go, dear.

1521
01:51:13,970 --> 01:51:14,953
Dear.

1522
01:51:18,599 --> 01:51:19,787
Here you go, dear.

1523
01:51:20,114 --> 01:51:22,859
If Suraj's mom was with us today

1524
01:51:23,637 --> 01:51:25,644
she would have done some amazing
embroidery work

1525
01:51:25,726 --> 01:51:27,898
on this dress, herself.
Here you go.

1526
01:51:29,249 --> 01:51:31,707
Listen, it's a very important
day tomorrow.

1527
01:51:32,730 --> 01:51:34,902
On one hand, you will have
Sikander as the groom

1528
01:51:35,351 --> 01:51:36,703
and on the other, Suraj.

1529
01:51:37,809 --> 01:51:41,169
If you wear
this wedding dress tomorrow

1530
01:51:43,995 --> 01:51:46,165
Suraj's love will be honoured.

1531
01:52:18,033 --> 01:52:19,508
All this is not going
to help, Aunt.

1532
01:52:19,631 --> 01:52:21,145
You still have time.
Stop this wedding.

1533
01:52:21,391 --> 01:52:22,538
Or else, your. . 
- Chunnu

1534
01:52:23,767 --> 01:52:25,775
keep your advice to yourself.

1535
01:52:40,847 --> 01:52:42,281
Roshni. . 
- Yes?

1536
01:52:43,018 --> 01:52:44,288
Why are you sitting in the dark?

1537
01:52:45,230 --> 01:52:47,156
Are you asking me this

1538
01:52:48,508 --> 01:52:50,883
after taking away
the happiness of my life?

1539
01:52:58,624 --> 01:53:00,508
I have nurtured you in my womb
for nine months

1540
01:53:00,590 --> 01:53:01,696
and given birth to you.

1541
01:53:02,229 --> 01:53:04,523
I have nurtured you
with my milk and brought you up.

1542
01:53:05,792 --> 01:53:09,479
Don't I even deserve
to choose your life partner?

1543
01:53:10,627 --> 01:53:12,182
You are not demanding
your rights.

1544
01:53:12,593 --> 01:53:13,493
Instead, you are asking me

1545
01:53:13,534 --> 01:53:14,640
to pay a price
for giving birth to me.

1546
01:53:14,682 --> 01:53:17,179
I don't care
what you think it to be.

1547
01:53:17,589 --> 01:53:18,818
The wedding procession
will be here soon.

1548
01:53:19,228 --> 01:53:21,521
Get dressed in this wedding dress
and come downstairs.

1549
01:53:21,809 --> 01:53:23,406
It is not my wedding dress
but my shroud.

1550
01:53:24,184 --> 01:53:26,355
This will remain
a wedding dress

1551
01:53:26,724 --> 01:53:28,525
if you agree to this marriage.

1552
01:53:29,059 --> 01:53:30,410
But if you refuse,
people will think

1553
01:53:30,819 --> 01:53:32,335
that your wedding dress

1554
01:53:32,908 --> 01:53:34,506
turned out to be my shroud.

1555
01:54:01,949 --> 01:54:04,080
'This will remain
a wedding dress'

1556
01:54:04,489 --> 01:54:06,332
'if you agree to this marriage. '

1557
01:54:06,823 --> 01:54:08,258
'If you refuse,
people will think'

1558
01:54:08,627 --> 01:54:10,182
'that your wedding dress'

1559
01:54:10,716 --> 01:54:12,190
'turned out to be my shroud. '

1560
01:54:15,508 --> 01:54:17,105
'Listen, it's a very important
day tomorrow. '

1561
01:54:17,597 --> 01:54:19,849
'On one hand, you will have
Sikander as the groom'

1562
01:54:20,301 --> 01:54:21,815
'and on the other, Suraj. '

1563
01:54:22,758 --> 01:54:26,116
'If you wear
this wedding dress tomorrow'

1564
01:54:27,059 --> 01:54:29,311
'Suraj's love will be honoured. '

1565
01:54:31,400 --> 01:54:33,449
'This will remain wedding dress'

1566
01:54:33,572 --> 01:54:34,923
'if you agree to this marriage. '

1567
01:54:35,127 --> 01:54:36,602
'If you refuse,
people will think'

1568
01:54:36,684 --> 01:54:37,995
'that your wedding dress'

1569
01:54:38,118 --> 01:54:39,551
'turned out to be my shroud. '

1570
01:54:40,084 --> 01:54:42,090
'Suraj's love will be honoured. '

1571
01:54:42,213 --> 01:54:45,245
'Your wedding dress
turned out to be my shroud. '

1572
01:54:45,369 --> 01:54:47,415
'Suraj's love will be honoured. '

1573
01:54:47,538 --> 01:54:50,529
'Your wedding dress
turned out to be my shroud. '

1574
01:54:50,775 --> 01:54:52,822
'Suraj's love will be honoured. '

1575
01:54:53,110 --> 01:54:54,542
'Your wedding dress
turned out to be my shroud. '

1576
01:54:54,707 --> 01:54:57,450
'Suraj's love will be honoured.
- It turned out to be a shroud. '

1577
01:54:57,573 --> 01:54:59,008
'Suraj's love will be honoured. . '

1578
01:55:21,004 --> 01:55:22,395
The auspicious time
is getting over.

1579
01:55:22,478 --> 01:55:23,501
Please summon the bride here.

1580
01:55:23,624 --> 01:55:25,673
Chunnu, go and get Roshni.

1581
01:55:26,492 --> 01:55:27,803
Wait!

1582
01:55:41,442 --> 01:55:42,466
Who is he?

1583
01:55:45,252 --> 01:55:47,915
Ma'am, just order me.

1584
01:55:48,446 --> 01:55:50,658
My henchmen will finish
him off in no time.

1585
01:55:54,713 --> 01:55:55,738
Suraj

1586
01:55:56,188 --> 01:55:58,483
it would be in your interest
that you leave from here.

1587
01:55:58,606 --> 01:55:59,589
I will go

1588
01:55:59,752 --> 01:56:01,513
but only after taking
Roshni with me.

1589
01:56:05,487 --> 01:56:07,453
Perhaps,
you don't love your life.

1590
01:56:07,780 --> 01:56:09,009
Had it been the case

1591
01:56:09,500 --> 01:56:11,385
I wouldn't have come here
putting my life at risk.

1592
01:56:11,508 --> 01:56:12,818
I am warning you. Stop!
Otherwise. .

1593
01:56:13,801 --> 01:56:15,030
Otherwise, what will you do?

1594
01:56:16,259 --> 01:56:19,044
Are you going to riddle
my chest with bullets?

1595
01:56:19,658 --> 01:56:22,771
Will your aides
chop me into pieces?

1596
01:56:22,894 --> 01:56:23,919
Is that all?

1597
01:56:25,148 --> 01:56:26,540
Don't try to scare me
with death.

1598
01:56:26,949 --> 01:56:29,038
I have come here
prepared to die.

1599
01:56:29,161 --> 01:56:31,538
You have claimed your love
for Roshni earlier as well.

1600
01:56:31,742 --> 01:56:33,585
But you have always lost.

1601
01:56:33,750 --> 01:56:35,428
What you presumed
to be my defeat

1602
01:56:35,920 --> 01:56:38,296
was my first step
towards success.

1603
01:56:38,746 --> 01:56:39,729
And now

1604
01:56:39,975 --> 01:56:41,860
my destiny is right in front of me.

1605
01:57:11,391 --> 01:57:13,276
Stop!
- Hey, you blabbermouth!

1606
01:57:16,716 --> 01:57:19,256
Do you have the licence
for this rifle?

1607
01:57:20,936 --> 01:57:24,868
I have a big problem with this
policy of the government.

1608
01:57:25,933 --> 01:57:28,801
A licence should be issued
not to own the gun

1609
01:57:28,924 --> 01:57:30,561
but for having
the guts to use it.

1610
01:57:30,890 --> 01:57:32,856
If you have the courage,
fire the gun.

1611
01:57:33,633 --> 01:57:35,026
Do you have the courage?

1612
01:57:35,517 --> 01:57:37,197
He is taking away my wife. . 
- Shut up!

1613
01:57:37,729 --> 01:57:40,966
She is of your daughter's age
and you want to marry her!

1614
01:57:42,275 --> 01:57:43,505
Suraj

1615
01:57:43,873 --> 01:57:45,513
take Roshni
and leave from here.

1616
01:57:46,454 --> 01:57:50,836
I will take care
of all these people.

1617
01:58:03,125 --> 01:58:06,688
Both of you stand up
and exchange garlands.

1618
01:58:13,201 --> 01:58:14,267
Stop!

1619
01:58:22,746 --> 01:58:25,203
Roshni, before you
destroy your life

1620
01:58:26,267 --> 01:58:27,824
I want to tell you something.

1621
01:58:29,421 --> 01:58:31,060
Roshni, perhaps,
you don't know who I am.

1622
01:58:31,962 --> 01:58:33,599
But I know this guy quite well

1623
01:58:33,682 --> 01:58:35,238
who is the son of a criminal.

1624
01:58:36,140 --> 01:58:37,532
He is not the son of Mangtaram

1625
01:58:38,433 --> 01:58:40,972
but is the son of the murderer,
Rakabh Singh.

1626
01:58:48,509 --> 01:58:49,820
Do you mean
the same Rakabh Singh

1627
01:58:50,065 --> 01:58:51,581
who had killed my father?

1628
01:58:51,704 --> 01:58:52,809
Yes, Roshni.

1629
01:58:53,220 --> 01:58:54,941
Your mother became a widow
at a very young age

1630
01:58:55,432 --> 01:58:57,602
because his father
killed your father.

1631
01:59:00,470 --> 01:59:04,525
You lost your father
even before you were born.

1632
01:59:04,688 --> 01:59:05,712
This is a lie.

1633
01:59:05,917 --> 01:59:07,064
Suraj is my son.

1634
01:59:07,146 --> 01:59:09,644
By adopting him, he doesn't
become your own son, Mangtaram.

1635
01:59:10,178 --> 01:59:11,570
He is not your blood

1636
01:59:12,184 --> 01:59:14,273
instead, he is the blood
of that murderer, Rakabh Singh.

1637
01:59:15,420 --> 01:59:18,492
He had killed his employer,
Mr. Mohanlal

1638
01:59:18,984 --> 01:59:21,810
for a trivial sum of Rs. 500.

1639
01:59:22,957 --> 01:59:25,128
If you don't believe my words

1640
01:59:26,275 --> 01:59:31,314
then this newspaper is the proof
that his father, Rakabh Singh

1641
01:59:31,641 --> 01:59:34,386
had murdered your father,
Mr. Mohanlal.

1642
01:59:35,531 --> 01:59:37,375
Read this file carefully.

1643
01:59:38,318 --> 01:59:39,586
It is clearly written in this

1644
01:59:39,669 --> 01:59:42,741
that Suraj is the son
of the murderer, Rakabh Singh

1645
01:59:43,233 --> 01:59:44,911
and was adopted by Mangtaram.

1646
01:59:45,034 --> 01:59:47,451
Suraj is the son of your
father's murderer.

1647
01:59:48,107 --> 01:59:50,606
Suraj's father had taken
your father away from you.

1648
01:59:51,752 --> 01:59:55,356
Even after his death,
do you want your father's soul

1649
01:59:55,438 --> 01:59:56,627
to suffer

1650
01:59:57,282 --> 01:59:58,387
to roam around

1651
01:59:59,125 --> 02:00:00,231
to be in agony

1652
02:00:00,928 --> 02:00:02,115
and keep cursing himself

1653
02:00:02,606 --> 02:00:03,509
that he would've
been better off

1654
02:00:03,589 --> 02:00:05,023
being childless than
having a daughter like you?

1655
02:00:05,310 --> 02:00:10,102
Do you want to make
the son of the murderer

1656
02:00:10,881 --> 02:00:13,666
who made your mother a widow,
her son-in-law?

1657
02:00:14,445 --> 02:00:15,591
Tell me, Roshni, answer me.

1658
02:00:16,534 --> 02:00:18,663
What is your answer
to my questions? Tell me.

1659
02:00:38,938 --> 02:00:43,280
Jagatpal, in these 14 years

1660
02:00:43,362 --> 02:00:46,229
I had built my family
with great difficulty.

1661
02:00:47,500 --> 02:00:51,227
You came here
and destroyed everything.

1662
02:00:52,742 --> 02:00:54,259
I swear on my son

1663
02:00:54,913 --> 02:00:56,756
that I'll kill you!

1664
02:00:58,314 --> 02:00:59,624
I'll kill you!

1665
02:01:08,963 --> 02:01:10,683
'Can't we even be good friends?'

1666
02:01:10,805 --> 02:01:11,912
'Of course, we can. '

1667
02:01:12,403 --> 02:01:15,311
'But your wealth will become
the enemy of our friendship. '

1668
02:01:16,090 --> 02:01:17,318
'That will never happen. '

1669
02:01:18,302 --> 02:01:19,407
'What if it happens?'

1670
02:01:20,310 --> 02:01:23,831
'I would rather die
than break our friendship. '

1671
02:02:05,776 --> 02:02:10,200
"Whenever I miss you"

1672
02:02:10,485 --> 02:02:14,869
"I feel like I am dying. "

1673
02:02:15,155 --> 02:02:19,496
"Whenever I miss you"

1674
02:02:19,701 --> 02:02:24,125
"I feel like I am dying. "

1675
02:02:24,411 --> 02:02:28,877
"Seasons come and go. "

1676
02:02:29,040 --> 02:02:33,301
"Seasons come and go. "

1677
02:02:33,382 --> 02:02:37,765
"But why don't you come
to meet me?"

1678
02:02:39,568 --> 02:02:44,155
"I haven't gotten over you,
I am missing you. "

1679
02:02:44,238 --> 02:02:48,578
"Not just once,
but hundreds of times. "

1680
02:02:48,701 --> 02:02:51,446
"A hundred times. "

1681
02:02:51,568 --> 02:02:55,747
"Whenever I miss you"

1682
02:02:55,951 --> 02:03:00,581
"I feel like I am dying. "

1683
02:03:32,938 --> 02:03:37,157
"Come and tell me"

1684
02:03:37,526 --> 02:03:41,417
"what is stopping you. "

1685
02:03:42,196 --> 02:03:46,496
"Why is there"

1686
02:03:46,824 --> 02:03:50,797
"such distance between us?"

1687
02:03:55,590 --> 02:03:59,891
"I will defame you, dear. "

1688
02:04:00,137 --> 02:04:04,560
"You will be known
as a betrayer. "

1689
02:04:05,011 --> 02:04:09,026
"Come into my life. "

1690
02:04:09,395 --> 02:04:13,327
"Don't be upset with me. "

1691
02:04:13,941 --> 02:04:18,200
"The seasons keep changing. "

1692
02:04:18,569 --> 02:04:22,543
"The seasons keep changing. "

1693
02:04:22,666 --> 02:04:26,884
"Why don't you ever come?"

1694
02:04:29,136 --> 02:04:33,479
"I never forgot about you
and I always miss you. "

1695
02:04:33,806 --> 02:04:38,066
"I miss you not just once
but several times. "

1696
02:04:38,352 --> 02:04:40,523
"I miss you several times. "

1697
02:04:41,015 --> 02:04:44,907
"I keep missing you"

1698
02:04:45,645 --> 02:04:49,700
"and my life belongs to you. "

1699
02:05:22,180 --> 02:05:26,768
"I feel very lonely"

1700
02:05:27,096 --> 02:05:30,742
"without you. "

1701
02:05:30,782 --> 02:05:35,411
"You have taken away"

1702
02:05:36,353 --> 02:05:40,204
"all my happiness. "

1703
02:05:45,242 --> 02:05:47,412
"Listen, my love. "

1704
02:05:47,494 --> 02:05:51,713
"There's no end to my craziness"

1705
02:05:51,713 --> 02:05:54,130
"and I will die in your love. "

1706
02:05:54,621 --> 02:05:58,594
"I have realised it today"

1707
02:05:59,128 --> 02:06:02,977
"that you're a liar, dear. "

1708
02:06:03,552 --> 02:06:07,810
"The seasons keep changing. "

1709
02:06:08,138 --> 02:06:12,193
"The seasons keep changing. "

1710
02:06:12,316 --> 02:06:16,700
"Why don't you ever come?"

1711
02:06:18,666 --> 02:06:23,048
"I never forgot about you
and I always miss you. "

1712
02:06:23,416 --> 02:06:27,717
"I miss you not just once
but several times. "

1713
02:06:27,963 --> 02:06:30,052
"I miss you several times. "

1714
02:06:30,625 --> 02:06:34,599
"I keep missing you"

1715
02:06:35,213 --> 02:06:39,227
"and my life belongs to you. "

1716
02:06:39,556 --> 02:06:43,734
"I keep missing you"

1717
02:06:44,183 --> 02:06:48,197
"and my life belongs to you. "

1718
02:07:09,170 --> 02:07:11,422
Yes, it's true

1719
02:07:11,463 --> 02:07:14,371
that you're Rakabh Singh's son.

1720
02:07:16,297 --> 02:07:18,755
But Mr. Mangtaram has always
loved you like his own child.

1721
02:07:25,759 --> 02:07:27,725
This is something that happened
18 years ago.

1722
02:07:29,200 --> 02:07:30,714
Your father, Rakabh Singh

1723
02:07:31,370 --> 02:07:33,541
was working as a driver
for Mr. Mohanlal.

1724
02:07:34,115 --> 02:07:37,882
Your mother fell sick
all of a sudden one day.

1725
02:07:40,136 --> 02:07:42,840
Rakabh Singh didn't have money
to buy the medicines.

1726
02:07:44,477 --> 02:07:45,870
He walked out of the hospital

1727
02:07:45,952 --> 02:07:47,878
leaving your mother
in such a critical condition

1728
02:07:49,638 --> 02:07:50,908
and he never returned.

1729
02:07:53,325 --> 02:07:54,963
Your mother died then.

1730
02:07:57,052 --> 02:07:59,837
You were sitting
next to her and weeping.

1731
02:08:01,722 --> 02:08:05,080
Mr. Mangtaram heard you cry

1732
02:08:06,104 --> 02:08:08,767
who had a wife who gave birth
to a dead child thrice.

1733
02:08:09,340 --> 02:08:10,446
And the doctors claimed

1734
02:08:10,487 --> 02:08:12,126
that his wife might die
due to the trauma.

1735
02:08:12,699 --> 02:08:13,846
He picked you up.

1736
02:08:18,147 --> 02:08:19,662
Fate is so astonishing.

1737
02:08:20,973 --> 02:08:22,530
Mr. Mangtaram got a son

1738
02:08:23,799 --> 02:08:25,192
but his wife passed away.

1739
02:08:26,011 --> 02:08:27,568
On the other hand

1740
02:08:27,609 --> 02:08:30,558
Rakabh Singh went to ask
his employer for a loan.

1741
02:08:31,787 --> 02:08:35,145
He was accused of stealing
jewellery worth Rs. 20 lakhs

1742
02:08:35,187 --> 02:08:37,071
from Mr. Mohanlal's treasury.

1743
02:08:38,340 --> 02:08:40,183
He was also accused of murder.

1744
02:08:41,535 --> 02:08:42,600
Sikander.

1745
02:08:43,583 --> 02:08:45,918
Now, be a good boy
and sign the papers.

1746
02:08:46,778 --> 02:08:48,621
The wealth you will inherit
from Ms. Shakuntala

1747
02:08:48,662 --> 02:08:50,710
after your marriage

1748
02:08:51,530 --> 02:08:54,479
even I will be a 50 percent
partner of that.

1749
02:08:56,609 --> 02:08:58,001
I will sign.

1750
02:08:59,803 --> 02:09:00,991
Tell me something.

1751
02:09:01,811 --> 02:09:04,145
For whom are you collecting
such a large sum of money?

1752
02:09:04,432 --> 02:09:06,562
Neither do you have a family,
nor any loved ones.

1753
02:09:07,136 --> 02:09:09,634
In fact, even your wife is. .

1754
02:09:10,781 --> 02:09:12,460
Whom do you have, Sikander?

1755
02:09:13,484 --> 02:09:15,737
Even you don't have anyone.
Then why are you. .

1756
02:09:15,778 --> 02:09:18,440
I have my entire life
ahead of me.

1757
02:09:20,325 --> 02:09:22,659
You can depart
at any point in time. .

1758
02:09:24,052 --> 02:09:25,322
Sikander

1759
02:09:26,838 --> 02:09:30,196
life hasn't burdened me
as much

1760
02:09:31,261 --> 02:09:34,210
as the lives
which I have taken.

1761
02:09:40,559 --> 02:09:44,819
One more thing, maybe,
you haven't seen my lifeline.

1762
02:09:46,417 --> 02:09:48,096
Take a close look.

1763
02:09:49,775 --> 02:09:52,765
I will die after your funeral.

1764
02:09:55,510 --> 02:09:56,534
Goodbye.

1765
02:10:03,292 --> 02:10:04,685
Goodbye!

1766
02:10:06,118 --> 02:10:09,682
I will make sure
that I end your life

1767
02:10:11,198 --> 02:10:13,123
tonight itself.

1768
02:10:14,393 --> 02:10:15,458
Abdul!

1769
02:10:20,209 --> 02:10:22,667
You have broken the locks
of several vaults.

1770
02:10:24,878 --> 02:10:28,811
This man has my life
trapped in a vault.

1771
02:10:30,039 --> 02:10:32,128
This job should be done tonight.

1772
02:10:33,357 --> 02:10:36,716
Even if you have
to kill Jagatpal for it.

1773
02:10:37,699 --> 02:10:38,764
Okay, sir.

1774
02:10:41,508 --> 02:10:42,860
Jagatpal.

1775
02:12:22,845 --> 02:12:23,910
You!

1776
02:13:02,003 --> 02:13:02,986
Hello, Sikander here.

1777
02:13:03,027 --> 02:13:04,747
Mr. Sikander, it's me.
Abdul.

1778
02:13:04,911 --> 02:13:06,795
Yes, Abdul. Tell me.
Is the job done?

1779
02:13:06,836 --> 02:13:08,352
Someone else did it
before me.

1780
02:13:09,458 --> 02:13:10,646
What do you mean?
- I mean

1781
02:13:10,687 --> 02:13:12,284
that person took the papers
from the vault

1782
02:13:12,366 --> 02:13:14,168
and that person murdered
Mr. Jagatpal.

1783
02:13:14,168 --> 02:13:15,110
Who murdered him?

1784
02:13:15,807 --> 02:13:18,264
Someone you can never guess.

1785
02:13:18,633 --> 02:13:19,780
His name is. .

1786
02:13:21,418 --> 02:13:22,319
Hello.

1787
02:13:52,917 --> 02:13:54,105
Jagatpal.

1788
02:13:55,334 --> 02:13:59,307
You ruined my life and you
are sleeping peacefully!

1789
02:13:59,348 --> 02:14:00,986
Isn't it? Get up!

1790
02:14:01,805 --> 02:14:03,444
Get up, you scoundrel!

1791
02:14:04,427 --> 02:14:05,778
If you have the courage
then say it again

1792
02:14:05,819 --> 02:14:07,458
that Suraj isn't my son.

1793
02:14:07,540 --> 02:14:08,400
Say it!

1794
02:14:18,107 --> 02:14:19,337
Sir, there is blood
on the knife.

1795
02:14:27,898 --> 02:14:31,993
Mangtaram, what all have you
stolen from this vault?

1796
02:14:32,280 --> 02:14:35,352
I didn't come here to steal,
I came to kill him.

1797
02:14:35,639 --> 02:14:36,786
I have done it.

1798
02:15:05,663 --> 02:15:06,646
Dad. .

1799
02:15:07,547 --> 02:15:08,776
What have you done?

1800
02:15:10,332 --> 02:15:11,356
Why did you do this?

1801
02:15:14,264 --> 02:15:15,657
What else could I do?

1802
02:15:17,255 --> 02:15:19,794
Jagatpal ruined your life.

1803
02:15:20,491 --> 02:15:21,842
I couldn't do anything about it.

1804
02:15:22,948 --> 02:15:25,406
Roshni left you stranded
at the wedding altar.

1805
02:15:26,266 --> 02:15:28,601
Your life was ruined
and I

1806
02:15:29,788 --> 02:15:32,041
couldn't do anything.

1807
02:15:33,106 --> 02:15:35,277
I couldn't cope
with your grief, dear.

1808
02:15:35,687 --> 02:15:37,940
Your anguish

1809
02:15:37,981 --> 02:15:39,987
was causing me sufferance.

1810
02:15:40,356 --> 02:15:41,872
That's why, I killed him.

1811
02:15:43,223 --> 02:15:46,255
I kept stabbing him
until he died.

1812
02:15:46,951 --> 02:15:50,228
If anyone ever tries
to harm you

1813
02:15:50,269 --> 02:15:51,743
then I will kill
that person as well.

1814
02:15:54,365 --> 02:15:56,249
Dear, I can bear
with everything

1815
02:15:57,109 --> 02:15:59,034
but I can't bear
to see you cry. .

1816
02:16:01,410 --> 02:16:04,564
I got you when you
were an infant.

1817
02:16:05,916 --> 02:16:08,291
I have brought you up
in a loving manner.

1818
02:16:09,643 --> 02:16:10,872
You didn't have a mother.

1819
02:16:11,527 --> 02:16:14,804
I used to sing lullabies
and put you to bed.

1820
02:16:17,262 --> 02:16:18,941
I had so many dreams.

1821
02:16:20,416 --> 02:16:22,464
That lawyer ruined everything.

1822
02:16:23,488 --> 02:16:25,003
He ruined everything.

1823
02:16:25,700 --> 02:16:26,519
Dad. .

1824
02:16:26,928 --> 02:16:29,550
Would I have died if I wouldn't
have got Roshni?

1825
02:16:33,113 --> 02:16:34,178
I would've survived

1826
02:16:34,465 --> 02:16:38,438
but I won't be able to survive
if I lose you.

1827
02:16:40,937 --> 02:16:42,043
Why are you crying?

1828
02:16:43,477 --> 02:16:44,910
I have no regrets.

1829
02:16:45,852 --> 02:16:48,146
I am ready to die

1830
02:16:48,433 --> 02:16:50,890
but I plea before the Almighty

1831
02:16:51,013 --> 02:16:52,693
that you get
the love of your life.

1832
02:16:53,184 --> 02:16:55,314
I would like
to meet Ms. Shakuntala

1833
02:16:55,355 --> 02:16:57,608
before I am hanged
to death.

1834
02:16:58,673 --> 02:17:00,967
I will beg her

1835
02:17:01,786 --> 02:17:04,039
to send Roshni to our house.

1836
02:17:04,899 --> 02:17:08,667
I would beg
for your happiness.

1837
02:17:09,282 --> 02:17:12,476
I will ask her not to punish you
for your father's misdeeds.

1838
02:17:13,378 --> 02:17:14,975
I will beg before her.

1839
02:17:15,098 --> 02:17:16,655
I will beg before her!

1840
02:17:31,974 --> 02:17:33,244
Hello.

1841
02:18:04,578 --> 02:18:05,479
Sir.

1842
02:18:05,643 --> 02:18:06,749
This is Abdul.

1843
02:18:07,036 --> 02:18:08,265
Who is that?

1844
02:18:08,346 --> 02:18:10,722
He always had a part to play

1845
02:18:10,763 --> 02:18:12,443
in all the robberies
of the city.

1846
02:18:12,525 --> 02:18:14,450
He was an expert
at unlocking vaults.

1847
02:18:15,269 --> 02:18:17,235
Do something.
- Tell me, sir.

1848
02:18:17,849 --> 02:18:19,938
Ask the telephone exchange

1849
02:18:20,062 --> 02:18:22,683
whom he called, from here.

1850
02:18:22,969 --> 02:18:23,871
Okay.

1851
02:19:26,008 --> 02:19:27,523
I didn't kill him!

1852
02:19:29,817 --> 02:19:33,258
I know.
But what are you doing here?

1853
02:19:33,544 --> 02:19:38,460
Inspector, Khanna, Jagatpal,
Mathur and I had dreamed

1854
02:19:38,746 --> 02:19:41,942
of building a hotel ages ago.

1855
02:19:42,105 --> 02:19:43,744
Those three aren't alive anymore.

1856
02:19:43,948 --> 02:19:47,635
That's why I had come
to invite Khanna's son

1857
02:19:47,676 --> 02:19:48,987
for the inauguration
of my hotel.

1858
02:19:49,355 --> 02:19:50,461
I see.

1859
02:19:51,403 --> 02:19:54,926
Let me tell you something,
Mr. Kalka Singh.

1860
02:19:56,605 --> 02:20:01,521
You're next
on the murderer's list.

1861
02:20:04,429 --> 02:20:07,173
Be vigilant.

1862
02:20:10,491 --> 02:20:13,727
Did dad really kill the lawyer?

1863
02:20:13,768 --> 02:20:16,144
Your dad, Rakabh Singh,
is not a murderer

1864
02:20:16,307 --> 02:20:18,027
and neither is Mangtaram.

1865
02:20:18,642 --> 02:20:20,731
Advocate Jagatpal

1866
02:20:22,410 --> 02:20:23,926
wasn't killed by Mangtaram.

1867
02:20:25,319 --> 02:20:27,981
The killer committed
the murder and escaped

1868
02:20:28,350 --> 02:20:30,275
but Mangtaram was caught.

1869
02:20:30,725 --> 02:20:33,593
Similarly,
Mohanlal wasn't killed

1870
02:20:34,043 --> 02:20:36,419
by your dad, Rakabh Singh.

1871
02:20:37,689 --> 02:20:40,433
Suraj.
- Roshni. .

1872
02:20:43,382 --> 02:20:45,717
Looks like you, too, are here
to cut your ties with me

1873
02:20:46,454 --> 02:20:48,707
the son of a murderer. . 
- Stop it, Suraj. .

1874
02:20:50,263 --> 02:20:51,615
I heard everything he said.

1875
02:20:57,514 --> 02:21:00,217
If you guys want the real killer
to be caught

1876
02:21:01,978 --> 02:21:04,108
you will have to help me.

1877
02:21:56,415 --> 02:22:00,511
"I don't want to live"

1878
02:22:00,634 --> 02:22:04,935
"if I don't have you in my life. "

1879
02:22:08,703 --> 02:22:12,717
"I do not care about my heart"

1880
02:22:12,758 --> 02:22:17,018
"if it doesn't have
an image of yours in it. "

1881
02:22:20,868 --> 02:22:24,719
"I don't want to live"

1882
02:22:24,882 --> 02:22:28,855
"if I don't have you in my life. "

1883
02:22:28,896 --> 02:22:32,870
"I do not care about my heart"

1884
02:22:32,870 --> 02:22:37,129
"if it doesn't have
an image of yours in it. "

1885
02:23:09,447 --> 02:23:17,558
"You insane lover of mine,
tell me what you want!"

1886
02:23:17,640 --> 02:23:21,408
"Tell me what you want. . "

1887
02:23:21,572 --> 02:23:29,723
"I just want your heart.
What else would I want?"

1888
02:23:29,805 --> 02:23:33,532
"What else would I want. . "

1889
02:23:33,696 --> 02:23:41,888
"I just want your heart.
What else would I want?"

1890
02:23:46,107 --> 02:23:50,203
"What's the point of my heartbeat"

1891
02:23:50,244 --> 02:23:54,832
"if my heart doesn't skip a beat
when your name is mentioned?"

1892
02:23:58,436 --> 02:24:04,294
"I do not care about my heart"

1893
02:24:04,334 --> 02:24:06,382
"if it doesn't have
an image of yours in it. "

1894
02:24:06,382 --> 02:24:14,534
"I don't want to live
if I don't have you in my life. "

1895
02:24:45,008 --> 02:24:53,159
"I want you around me
all the time. "

1896
02:24:53,200 --> 02:24:57,174
"I want you around me. . "

1897
02:24:57,214 --> 02:25:05,079
"I want you all the time.
You define love for me. "

1898
02:25:05,120 --> 02:25:09,052
"You define love for me. . "

1899
02:25:09,093 --> 02:25:17,162
"I want you all the time.
You define love for me. "

1900
02:25:21,381 --> 02:25:29,573
"I don't want my eyes
if they don't dream about you. "

1901
02:25:33,465 --> 02:25:41,452
"I don't want to live
if I don't have you in my life. "

1902
02:25:41,493 --> 02:25:45,261
"I do not care about my heart"

1903
02:25:45,384 --> 02:25:49,562
"if it doesn't have
an image of yours in it. "

1904
02:26:09,141 --> 02:26:10,042
It's you!

1905
02:26:28,556 --> 02:26:29,703
Something is wrong!

1906
02:26:29,949 --> 02:26:33,144
What happened. . 
- Who hit him. .

1907
02:27:17,996 --> 02:27:19,921
Don't worry.
The operation was successful.

1908
02:27:20,658 --> 02:27:22,051
He'll regain his senses
in an hour.

1909
02:27:22,665 --> 02:27:24,099
Thank you.
- Good luck.

1910
02:27:28,072 --> 02:27:30,448
Just as Kalka Singh
regains his senses

1911
02:27:31,677 --> 02:27:34,216
we'll get the killer.

1912
02:27:41,630 --> 02:27:43,064
The wounds look like they
were caused by a knife.

1913
02:27:43,350 --> 02:27:44,866
I can't touch them yet.

1914
02:27:45,030 --> 02:27:46,504
The police
has to be informed first.

1915
02:28:27,219 --> 02:28:28,448
Can't you see
where you're going!

1916
02:28:28,489 --> 02:28:29,390
Get lost!

1917
02:28:37,131 --> 02:28:41,760
Murder. .

1918
02:29:34,108 --> 02:29:35,828
Hey! Stop!

1919
02:29:37,220 --> 02:29:39,064
If you don't stop walking,
I will shoot you.

1920
02:29:40,661 --> 02:29:43,365
I said, stop!
Or I'll shoot you!

1921
02:29:47,215 --> 02:29:48,894
What have you done?
He is my patient.

1922
02:29:51,557 --> 02:29:52,581
He is deaf and mute.

1923
02:29:55,407 --> 02:29:56,308
Nurse!

1924
02:29:58,807 --> 02:30:00,240
He is a patient.

1925
02:30:02,616 --> 02:30:04,377
So, where did the killer go?

1926
02:30:56,766 --> 02:30:57,667
It's you.

1927
02:31:00,002 --> 02:31:01,804
So, you're the killer,
Rakabh Singh.

1928
02:31:06,105 --> 02:31:09,013
Why don't you kill me, too?

1929
02:31:11,020 --> 02:31:13,560
Perhaps killing your own son
will end your killing spree.

1930
02:31:15,157 --> 02:31:17,655
I would rather die
than live as a killer's son.

1931
02:31:18,106 --> 02:31:19,581
I wasn't a born killer.

1932
02:31:20,564 --> 02:31:22,202
I was forced to become one!

1933
02:31:23,882 --> 02:31:25,930
My mind
was poisoned to an extent

1934
02:31:26,012 --> 02:31:28,961
of becoming a murderer!

1935
02:31:32,852 --> 02:31:34,245
I vividly remember that night.

1936
02:31:35,310 --> 02:31:39,201
I left you with your mom
on that night

1937
02:31:40,553 --> 02:31:41,741
in this very hospital.

1938
02:31:48,990 --> 02:31:50,137
Get the medicines.

1939
02:31:51,284 --> 02:31:53,414
Doctor,
I'll get it straight away.

1940
02:31:53,496 --> 02:31:55,216
Hurry up, or she might die.

1941
02:31:55,585 --> 02:31:56,937
Doctor,
please don't say that.

1942
02:31:57,920 --> 02:32:01,606
Dear, take care of your mom.
I'll be right back.

1943
02:32:02,262 --> 02:32:03,286
Take a look at it!

1944
02:32:03,531 --> 02:32:06,522
It's a proof of your illegal
and criminal activities. Look!

1945
02:32:11,150 --> 02:32:14,181
I'm going to call up the police
and get you arrested.

1946
02:32:45,352 --> 02:32:49,858
Those scoundrels framed me
in the murder of Mr. Mohanlal

1947
02:32:50,186 --> 02:32:53,257
and the court sentenced me
to 14 years of imprisonment.

1948
02:32:53,954 --> 02:32:56,329
When I got released from the jail
after 14 years

1949
02:32:57,681 --> 02:33:01,941
those scoundrels tried to kill me
with a truck!

1950
02:33:02,023 --> 02:33:03,456
But you survived.

1951
02:33:08,249 --> 02:33:12,427
And you killed the truck driver
before anybody.

1952
02:33:18,243 --> 02:33:22,053
Then you came over here
in search of your enemies.

1953
02:33:23,445 --> 02:33:27,583
Rakabh Singh, there's something
that I don't understand.

1954
02:33:27,910 --> 02:33:29,999
I know that you killed the Kanva

1955
02:33:30,859 --> 02:33:33,686
but how come we found the doctor's
lighter at the crime scene?

1956
02:33:33,768 --> 02:33:36,635
After murdering him,
I dropped the lighter there.

1957
02:33:37,618 --> 02:33:40,157
You had no enmity
with Jagatpal's wife.

1958
02:33:40,731 --> 02:33:42,164
Why did you kill her?

1959
02:33:42,328 --> 02:33:43,844
I killed the doctor. .

1960
02:33:45,892 --> 02:33:47,244
And I was about to flee
from there. .

1961
02:33:48,349 --> 02:33:51,667
Suddenly, the doctor's wife
entered the room.

1962
02:33:52,405 --> 02:33:53,879
She spotted me.

1963
02:33:56,091 --> 02:33:59,081
In order to save my life,
I ended up taking hers.

1964
02:34:00,351 --> 02:34:01,744
And before I could leave
that place

1965
02:34:02,153 --> 02:34:04,160
I saw Lawyer Jagatpal
entering the house.

1966
02:34:15,834 --> 02:34:17,227
I switched off the lights
right away

1967
02:34:18,455 --> 02:34:19,848
and hid in the bathroom.

1968
02:34:33,611 --> 02:34:36,151
Along with the police,
even Jagatpal thought

1969
02:34:36,683 --> 02:34:38,157
that he killed both of them.

1970
02:34:39,223 --> 02:34:42,008
And then I got rid of him, too.

1971
02:34:42,622 --> 02:34:45,489
Sikander wasn't your enemy.

1972
02:34:46,595 --> 02:34:47,906
Why did you kill him then?

1973
02:34:48,152 --> 02:34:50,650
Like father like son.

1974
02:34:51,592 --> 02:34:53,600
The father ruined my life.

1975
02:34:54,132 --> 02:34:56,549
And the son was trying
to ruin my son's life.

1976
02:34:57,900 --> 02:34:59,826
So, I killed him!

1977
02:35:00,972 --> 02:35:03,061
Kalka Singh was my last target.

1978
02:35:04,127 --> 02:35:07,403
If you had not made my son
sleep in his bed

1979
02:35:08,591 --> 02:35:11,049
I would have put an end
to his life today!

1980
02:35:11,253 --> 02:35:13,670
Your game ends here,
Rakabh Singh.

1981
02:35:14,080 --> 02:35:16,005
Surrender yourself.

1982
02:35:16,128 --> 02:35:20,101
No. I will not surrender
until I kill Kalka Singh.

1983
02:35:20,592 --> 02:35:22,395
The game is not yet ended.

1984
02:35:26,122 --> 02:35:28,047
Rakabh Singh, stop!

1985
02:36:54,843 --> 02:36:56,686
Now, you can arrest me.

1986
02:37:29,209 --> 02:37:32,158
Come, hug me.

1987
02:37:32,240 --> 02:37:33,919
Come. .

1988
02:37:38,507 --> 02:37:42,889
"I'm a lover.
I'm a vagabond. "

1989
02:37:43,586 --> 02:37:47,477
"I'm madly in love with you. "

1990
02:37:47,559 --> 02:37:51,901
"I live to love.
Love is my full time job. "

1991
02:37:51,983 --> 02:37:56,447
"I live to love.
Love is my full time job. . "

1992
02:37:56,570 --> 02:38:01,035
"I'm a bit insane
and a bit crazy. "
