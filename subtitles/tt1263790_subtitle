1
00:00:00,041 --> 00:00:00,041
29.970

2
00:00:53,803 --> 00:01:04,230
You're the mother and father You're
the God who saves us with love

3
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:15,158
You're the mother and father You're
the God who saves us with love

4
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:19,037
You're the mother

5
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:36,763
We didn't see our mum's and dad's face
and didn't hear peaceful words

6
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:53,196
We didn't see our mum's and dad's face
and didn't hear peaceful words

7
00:01:54,531 --> 00:02:04,207
Nobody is there to love us

8
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:09,754
Don't you know this? Is there no mercy
of you Lord Muruga?

9
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:32,027
You're the mother and father You're
the God who saves us with love

10
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:37,032
You're the mother.

11
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:50,795
Dears! I don't want these musics. Why?
They are fine no?

12
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,965
O.K. Before we finish singing song,
put garland and get blessings

13
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:57,260
Somebody will pour anything on
mum. Put the garland

14
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:04,476
You're the mother. I sang already no?
Wait

15
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:10,065
Did you start putting garland to dustbin
again? Is it once in a year no?

16
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,276
I'd remove the wastes on that 1 day.
You can remove

17
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,946
Before removing see at once that there is
any child in this wastes

18
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:18,907
We were thrown, crawled and brought up
in these wastes only

19
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:25,163
Mum! Worship here. We all are that
who were in wastes Is that an egg?

20
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:30,377
He tells as carbuncle. Name of you 2 is
Lingam no? Did you change?

21
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,511
So that you're removing wastes here. So
that he told no? Go

22
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:46,434
Why you're shouting in the morning as
a bad time?

23
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:58,238
Are you telling me as cow? No. Can you
tie cow where children are reading?

24
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:01,408
Here after children should not read in
this place. Why? You keep quite

25
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:05,370
It will be so long for you to talk. I'll talk
to him. Why you're telling as not to read?

26
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:08,957
What will do after reading? Somehow
they are going to look after cows only

27
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:13,920
I've given this place to Konar. You're
yourself orphans

28
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:18,466
Are you having those orphans in addition?
Talk to Konar whatever you talk

29
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,094
You Nothing doing He is there
Talk there

30
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:31,271
He speaks in English. Then you might
know the importance of education

31
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:35,984
No need Leave. Can you tie cows in
the place where the children read?

32
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:43,450
Education is important no? Did you hear
the Konar notes? What for you?

33
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:49,372
What? You're looking this place in
someway. Can't tie cows here

34
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:53,626
I know that. But can I allot a man who
gives rent regularly no?

35
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:04,346
What? What will happen our wolf draw,
drawing?

36
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:08,183
A big Ravivarma! I'm going to send you
out. What about this drawing then?

37
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:14,147
Don't tell like that. See these infants.
Prattle talks and an infant face

38
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:18,777
A big infant children? Do you if I tell
Konar then he will bring more milk in liters?

39
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:22,072
Move. Move.

40
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:33,124
Don't hold my hands and legs. Can
you've money if you roam calmly?

41
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:39,381
Can you listen if I say a way to earn? I
won't steal, gamble and tell lies

42
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:43,259
So totally you're telling that you won't
earn I'll say an idea

43
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:47,514
Are you telling to look after the wine
shop when you're not here? That also wrong

44
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:50,016
Drink will spoil family. This is a
country in where Gandhi born

45
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:56,398
I won't give this responsible job to you.
I'll tell another idea. Tell. Are you acting?

46
00:05:56,815 --> 00:06:00,610
No. I'm worshipping really. No. I'll
send you in some place

47
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:05,031
I'm asking that can you act there? Now
I'm calling you as sir no? They are acting only

48
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:12,038
You're a big man. You're the correct
person to go there

49
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,366
Why are you pressing horn? Are you
also for that Holy pooja no? Get down.

50
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:56,416
No. I'm going to Alwarpet. Then go
back. Cars are there at back. Then wait

51
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:03,423
What? You're jamming the traffic. This
is a holy route Wait for 1/2 an hour

52
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:15,602
I ask to give a holy bless for the holy
friends to junior Vigadananda

53
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:22,567
who is a head follower of Lord
Ananda Vigadananda

54
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:30,867
He is not Vigadananda He is a Lire
Nanda

55
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,876
Lord Krishna told in Sanskrit already that
whenever worries come in world

56
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:48,468
he would take birth Now our
Ananda Vigadananda tell that in Tamil

57
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:52,931
Ananda Vigadananda is a lotus which
blossomed in devotee's heart like pond

58
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:55,558
Ananda Vigadananda is a key which
came to open the door of holy way

59
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:03,274
The heart of Ananda Vigadananda
speaks with God for devotees

60
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:06,861
Bindhi and sweet given by him are not
alone his gift

61
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:11,866
It is a new sight of Goddess and
Saraswathi

62
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:17,497
Our Ananda Vigadananda goes as
messenger to God daily for people's voice

63
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:22,961
If we say shortly Our Ananda
Vigadananda is a holy book who tells

64
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:28,341
the worries of devotees to God
without seeing the mornings & evenings

65
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:35,015
If he is a true God's birth then, some
handicap people are moving here.

66
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:38,393
We will see that can he cure at least
anyone of them

67
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,858
Come son Come

68
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:10,360
Was that nice?

69
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:39,472
Brother! Bless this child brother Why
I've to bless?

70
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:44,769
Your legs were cured no? To happen her
like that. Yes brother, bless me

71
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:50,025
Baby! If the leg should be cured then go
to hospital.

72
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:53,111
We came with money from village to
city in order to go to hospital only

73
00:10:53,445 --> 00:10:56,740
when we saw your legs were cured we
had put the money in Swamy's plate

74
00:10:57,282 --> 00:11:01,286
what? Have you put money in Swamy's
plate seeing me? Yes

75
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:08,418
How much did you put? 5000 Rs. What
a lady are you?

76
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,463
What are you going to do if you need for
child's treatment?

77
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:12,881
Swamy will give

78
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:21,389
Here. Before closing mouth Swamy
gave money

79
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:26,978
What are you talking standing here?
Was your work finished no?

80
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:30,815
Did you get money no? Go I'll tell
when another work comes Go

81
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:37,822
Where are you going with money? I'm
going to put in Swamy's plate

82
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:41,534
What if you put in plate or shirt? Both
are same Just you put

83
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,668
On those period elders told to control 3
wishes

84
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:56,007
I say it won't be enough of controlling 3
wishes, we have to control tongue.

85
00:11:57,133 --> 00:12:00,970
Don't you understand It's a tongue
We must control diet.

86
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:05,975
What will happen if we eat Dosa too
much? Stomach will spoil

87
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:17,404
Appalam and Vada are like that. So elders
told in that time as knowledge of children

88
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:26,538
Wish, Dosa, Appalam and Vada What
are you seeing? This is holy word

89
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:47,058
Tell Wish, Dosa, Appalam and Vada

90
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:52,397
It's o. k if blind thoughts can win, but
this faith won't be win

91
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:57,777
This is not a faith also. This is blunder
made to small children by that Swamy

92
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:04,451
What? Is the devil saying Veda? I don't
want to say Veda and become a devil

93
00:13:04,743 --> 00:13:09,122
I'll be like old dustbin. Leave me
What? What a problem for you?

94
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:11,624
Now you're punched no? That's
problem. What are you saying? Is it paper?

95
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:17,464
Conscience. What is it Conscience? All
tells that drink soils family

96
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:19,758
I had put a wine shop. Won't there be a
conscience in me?

97
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:23,803
You're talking about conscience highly.
All are cutting Goat in meat shop

98
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:27,223
Don't he has conscience? All are doing
business saying many lies

99
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:30,185
Don't the business men have
conscience? Why this much?

100
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:32,562
There is a saying that we can marriage
saying 1000 of lies

101
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:34,814
Don't there be conscience for marrying
people?

102
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,194
I don't know that what you'll do Go
and bring money.

103
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:41,696
Or you may say to vacate the home
tomorrow itself

104
00:13:41,905 --> 00:13:45,992
I'll say to vacate today itself go
Bring money

105
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:50,413
Did the conscience come? Did the
McDowell come?

106
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:57,253
Like that only Whatever you can, you
may offer those

107
00:13:57,712 --> 00:14:05,720
You'd not explain offering things.
Not as Explain.

108
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:14,312
You'd talk clearly and beautifully like
me Tell. You'd explain offering things.

109
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:24,072
Tell the truth always Very good!
You'd not tell these and all

110
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:33,957
Don't loose your courage You'd not
explain offering things

111
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:42,632
He came to tell some thing finally. I
became a sinner who could not hear

112
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:49,097
What did he may thought? He called me
as Bangaru! In between he died

113
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:56,896
Keep quite. Is there Damodara Naidu?
No

114
00:14:57,605 --> 00:15:01,568
Has he gone out? He has gone
completely leaving us.

115
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:12,037
What? What are you telling? What?
Bandage is on the legs

116
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:21,296
the lamps are lighten. How? We poured
oil and wick I didn't ask that

117
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:25,467
I asked that how he died He died by
accident. Did Any lorry hit?

118
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:28,178
No. A ladder. Did a ladder hit?

119
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:33,892
No When he painted by standing on
ladder, fell down and injured on head

120
00:15:36,728 --> 00:15:40,398
See! There is a bad news occur for a
man who stepped up in ladder

121
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:44,486
See there is another match in that he
also died while painting

122
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:47,947
He came to my studio also for
painting

123
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:55,538
one day Naidu sir came my studio. Are
you a Telugu man? Little

124
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:03,004
One day he came, felt it will be nice if I
draw him. He wanted me to draw

125
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:14,724
I told no? His final desire Paint him and
see. This is that. He died without seeing

126
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:20,522
Who is maintaining the credit and debit
here. He is maintaining Then you see

127
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:28,655
One day or one day all should die. We
have to draw a painting of you also

128
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:37,163
Because we don't what will happen
when Is your name Lingam?

129
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:43,294
How do you know? It's drawn He
died and I've painted.

130
00:16:43,795 --> 00:16:48,508
Why should we talk about those now?
You've drawn my dad in pant!

131
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:52,345
If I draw without that then won't ladies
see that? Nothing that

132
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:59,102
My dad usually wear dhoti only I
know

133
00:17:00,395 --> 00:17:06,026
He came with dhoti only. But he told
that it will be nice if wear pant while drawing

134
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:11,239
But we didn't get pant. Then we had put
his pant. He was fat and could not put zip

135
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:17,495
We drawn in painting only. Is this the
pant, which your dad put 1st and last?

136
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:28,483
This is the time to receive more and more
money

137
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:35,949
This is the time for the Goddess of
wealth to knock the entrance door

138
00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:43,832
If it knocks and offers money There
will be happiness like Cauvery river

139
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:51,297
The Jupiter is high and Luck is in moles.
We've received the pocket money

140
00:18:53,091 --> 00:18:56,928
We are the kings and winners always

141
00:19:00,432 --> 00:19:12,360
Brother! The happiness has started to
us

142
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:21,745
This is the time when to receive more and
more money

143
00:19:23,538 --> 00:19:29,336
This is the time for the Goddess of
wealth to knock the entrance door

144
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:20,428
Move. If we keep our leg on cow dung
then our shoe will become dirty. Move

145
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:24,391
We are searching Gandhi who is
missing

146
00:20:28,812 --> 00:20:35,568
We are searching Gandhi who is
missing Daily the peace in country is missing

147
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:43,201
Gandhi is living in currency by laughing
well with his mouth

148
00:20:44,035 --> 00:20:49,541
If we see currency we will laugh like
Gandhi grandpa

149
00:20:52,877 --> 00:21:04,889
Pocket money has occurred. Bring that
and put in suitcase completely

150
00:21:08,518 --> 00:21:14,274
This is the time when we received more
and more money

151
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:21,990
This is the minute when Goddess of
wealth knocks the door of entrance

152
00:21:23,491 --> 00:21:25,744
If it knocks What it has finished?

153
00:21:39,591 --> 00:21:46,139
Rama Lingam! Money is in hand.
Sundara lingam! Dosa is in the mouth

154
00:21:56,608 --> 00:22:00,445
See! The Veena is playing well. Is it
Veena? I know man

155
00:22:00,737 --> 00:22:04,449
This is a thing which is played by our
Mandolin Srinivasan. This is Sitar in Hindi

156
00:22:11,414 --> 00:22:14,834
When you & me are dancing.

157
00:22:18,713 --> 00:22:25,637
When you & me are dancing, the city
people will get excited and encourage us

158
00:22:26,513 --> 00:22:33,061
They can say that this pair is top. Totally
the country will praise us

159
00:22:34,104 --> 00:22:39,484
Ramalingam, Sundara Lingam and both
are male lions

160
00:22:42,987 --> 00:22:55,750
There is only our kingdom in whole city
and always

161
00:22:58,586 --> 00:23:04,342
This is the time to receive more and more
money

162
00:23:06,261 --> 00:23:11,891
This is the time for the Goddess of
wealth to knock the door of entrance

163
00:23:13,476 --> 00:23:20,608
If it knocks the home and offers money
Happiness will flow like Cauvery river

164
00:23:21,568 --> 00:23:27,115
The Jupiter is high and Luck came in
moles. We received pocket money

165
00:23:29,075 --> 00:23:32,954
We are the kings and winners always

166
00:23:36,124 --> 00:23:48,219
Brother! The happiness has started to
us

167
00:24:20,585 --> 00:24:25,965
Money is flying. Money makes many
things. This is doing more than that

168
00:24:28,593 --> 00:24:35,183
Why you didn't tell before itself? It's
struck Catch.

169
00:24:40,563 --> 00:24:43,358
you've earned are What? Are you
telling as wasted?

170
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:48,488
Now what wait. He is asking that
what can we do now.

171
00:24:48,947 --> 00:24:51,991
We had put our old dress in this
drainage trusting this money

172
00:24:52,492 --> 00:24:56,538
We are standing with panty now. Is it
yes? Yes

173
00:24:57,372 --> 00:25:02,377
children are What? Are they telling
yes? Yes

174
00:25:02,711 --> 00:25:06,464
Why are you grinding like grinder for
that? What can we do now? Think

175
00:25:43,668 --> 00:25:58,350
Vincent! Our friend has died. Are you
Vincent? Yes. Go and see

176
00:26:15,575 --> 00:26:20,705
How do you know that I'm Lingam and
not Vincent? What you're telling like this?

177
00:26:21,081 --> 00:26:22,999
I saw you on that day in Vigadananda's
meeting

178
00:26:24,292 --> 00:26:27,462
I also became a devotee of
Vigadananda. See!

179
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:46,606
Take care of Rosemary

180
00:26:59,786 --> 00:27:03,540
He is there. Is he alive? He is Come

181
00:27:24,853 --> 00:27:26,604
Is there a same name for dad and son?

182
00:27:47,792 --> 00:27:54,674
Do you know dad? Dad only ordered
this painting

183
00:27:55,633 --> 00:27:59,804
He's passed away before receiving
When did he give order?

184
00:28:04,601 --> 00:28:08,521
It might be 30 days before. I'm an artist.
I couldn't remember all these

185
00:28:10,398 --> 00:28:14,194
My dad was in coma from 6 months.
How did he give order?

186
00:28:15,195 --> 00:28:19,491
Could he not give in dream? Are you
playing? Today is Saturday

187
00:28:19,991 --> 00:28:22,952
Do you know that Saturday's death
won't go alone? Do you want to go with that?

188
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:31,961
But for us good day is Friday no sir? He
is Villain

189
00:28:32,879 --> 00:28:37,926
He told my dad asked... He has lied. Is it
so? Do you know that why he lied?

190
00:28:38,968 --> 00:28:47,811
Poverty He was in paralysis attack.
Do you know how he drawn painting?

191
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:53,274
You tell. By brush He drew with legs.

192
00:29:01,366 --> 00:29:06,287
Is it enough? Did you insult a handicap?
If your dad alive he might have scold you

193
00:29:07,122 --> 00:29:14,754
I'll come and speak with you Come,
Let's go Take care

194
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,164
Dear! Now you're stumbling
ordinarily

195
00:29:49,622 --> 00:29:52,834
If you finish drawing this board then
your honor will spread at all sides

196
00:29:54,294 --> 00:29:58,006
What? Are you telling as fraud? Is it
brush? O.K.

197
00:29:59,507 --> 00:30:02,552
What you'd do is leave some space in
side finished drawing this board

198
00:30:03,219 --> 00:30:08,933
Why? Why is, you've asked one chance
to you for drawing A nice chance

199
00:30:08,975 --> 00:30:15,982
A lady figure with bottle in one hand and
glass in another. Like pouring water

200
00:30:18,234 --> 00:30:24,407
It should be like foreign bottle. It should
come like this.

201
00:30:29,329 --> 00:30:34,959
Don't talk worse. What is this? You
admired with me and say as worse

202
00:30:35,043 --> 00:30:38,630
I don't know those. It should be clear and
nice for sight. Did you understand?

203
00:30:45,553 --> 00:30:48,014
The car had hit on our painter

204
00:31:31,391 --> 00:31:35,186
Do you like the old paintings such as
Raman; Seetha and Krishna drew by Ravivarma?

205
00:31:35,937 --> 00:31:41,276
Or do you like the modern Paintings of
Hussain, Anjali Menon and Vasudev?

206
00:31:43,611 --> 00:31:47,282
If I say like this men then they will
angry. If I say them then this men will angry

207
00:31:47,782 --> 00:31:51,494
No need of those. See this painting for
neutral status and prevent problem

208
00:31:51,995 --> 00:31:55,874
We can see painting whenever we need.
But can we see a painter like this?

209
00:31:58,126 --> 00:32:03,923
I've to speak many about Spoonerism and
Cubism. Give order

210
00:32:11,056 --> 00:32:17,187
No need. Falouda will be enough for
me. I know who are now only

211
00:32:18,146 --> 00:32:21,733
You're talking very funny. What do you
like?

212
00:32:26,529 --> 00:32:30,950
Do you like modern painting or old?
Shall I tell?

213
00:32:32,077 --> 00:32:36,831
You're coming to the point wherever we
go I like that

214
00:32:37,332 --> 00:32:41,795
I'm telling promisely that I like both.
You'd not hide like this? Talk correctly

215
00:32:43,046 --> 00:32:48,218
What do you tell about the modern
painting which shows thoughts in color?

216
00:32:54,724 --> 00:33:02,524
Thoughts Colors Assume that
you're going on road

217
00:33:02,691 --> 00:33:05,652
There is a traffic signal. There are colors
in that

218
00:33:06,111 --> 00:33:07,946
if they put red then we should stop. If
they put green then we should wait

219
00:33:08,488 --> 00:33:12,033
if they put yellow then we should
stand That is Government's thought

220
00:33:12,325 --> 00:33:16,830
If we go without following that police
may stop and ask where is license

221
00:33:16,955 --> 00:33:19,290
If we say as no then he may ask why
you didn't bring Xerox

222
00:33:19,708 --> 00:33:22,585
If we offer him at that time then we can
escape.

223
00:33:23,128 --> 00:33:27,632
Else we must go lawyer by his
thought They may ask 1008 of questions there

224
00:33:28,216 --> 00:33:31,553
So that leader told that can leg go in the
eye's way?

225
00:33:33,013 --> 00:33:36,725
Can mind go in leg's way? Wait I'll
tell

226
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,604
Are you telling those modern paintings
are wastes then?

227
00:33:42,022 --> 00:33:45,942
What you're telling as waste? No other
theatre will come like modern

228
00:33:46,192 --> 00:33:51,072
Did the 1st color Ali Baba and forty
robbers came or not? Leave that

229
00:33:51,448 --> 00:33:56,703
If we keep many breads in front of you
then can you say which is modern?

230
00:33:57,829 --> 00:33:59,205
Come Why so late?

231
00:34:13,845 --> 00:34:18,266
Whose mistake is this? Is it mine? It is
ours mistake Fell on us

232
00:34:19,059 --> 00:34:22,604
There is no water also here I'll wash
and come. Keep this

233
00:34:34,449 --> 00:34:36,868
In which side the bath room is?
Bathroom is in this side

234
00:35:34,384 --> 00:35:39,264
I've seen many modern paintings in my
experience till this year

235
00:35:39,931 --> 00:35:45,937
But I didn't see a painting with this big
meanings which is indirect

236
00:35:48,648 --> 00:35:53,153
He used a new technique which is not
used by anybody

237
00:35:53,945 --> 00:35:58,491
If we bring this painter to our college and
tell him to demonstrate a lecture then

238
00:35:59,159 --> 00:36:03,705
it will be useful to our students
you can arrange

239
00:36:06,124 --> 00:36:11,212
Don't know that what brush he used. I
also asked that professor

240
00:36:11,838 --> 00:36:15,300
He laughed for that & told he used some
Colgate brush

241
00:36:18,762 --> 00:36:22,599
This painting is made up of oil color or
water color?

242
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:34,903
Not both. He mixed petrol, diesel and
used a new technique in that also

243
00:36:35,945 --> 00:36:38,615
What is this? A Lingam image is drawn
in the corner

244
00:37:06,142 --> 00:37:14,150
I'd kill you then itself by car Don't
talk Is my painting for a wine shop?

245
00:37:15,902 --> 00:37:19,155
My name is not Janaki if I didn't bring
to court putting case on you

246
00:37:21,491 --> 00:37:25,829
Coming He drew without knowing
Leave I won't leave

247
00:37:26,621 --> 00:37:30,583
Leave. Don't leave. What you're telling
to leave? I'll fall if you leave

248
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:37,549
That brandy man told to draw. Did I tell
to draw her? I told to draw a beautiful girl

249
00:37:38,883 --> 00:37:43,972
Isn't she beautiful completely? Now you
leave him It's you

250
00:37:44,597 --> 00:37:51,021
You're a least painter who can draw
worse for money. Leave me

251
00:38:04,617 --> 00:38:08,455
What about sorry always? Please say
at least once, which I asked

252
00:38:11,291 --> 00:38:16,713
I can't. We love from last 1 week. How
if you say you can't?

253
00:38:24,846 --> 00:38:28,683
There is nobody near us. Why should
you feel shy? Say with brave

254
00:38:37,817 --> 00:38:39,277
You told at least now

255
00:38:59,089 --> 00:39:03,551
How do you think these? These are all
because of age fault

256
00:39:04,552 --> 00:39:06,012
I think you like Ramayana very much

257
00:39:10,433 --> 00:39:14,979
But you're talking like a leftist just.
O.K Left

258
00:39:24,614 --> 00:39:27,701
Squirrel is nearer to Lord Raman. Who
is standing near Squirrel?

259
00:39:29,285 --> 00:39:34,499
Is that Jambavan? How can you know
these all?

260
00:39:35,583 --> 00:39:39,754
Not for me alone, this must be known
those who have knowledge

261
00:39:40,547 --> 00:39:46,720
Other painters put signature only. But
you're stamping by your thumb impression

262
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:51,975
We can catch your painting by your
thumb impression completely

263
00:39:53,101 --> 00:39:57,814
What you're talking as thump
impression, stealing and catching in wrong time.

264
00:39:57,897 --> 00:39:59,107
Shall we talk about any other thing?

265
00:40:06,906 --> 00:40:08,199
Did you start again?

266
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,327
It will be bore to you. Because you're
intelligent and you won't be proud

267
00:40:12,662 --> 00:40:15,582
But we are not like that and should know
many matters.

268
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:21,588
Why are you painting with hands
without brush? It's for what effect?

269
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:30,638
All for some electric effect first I
cleaned with towel. Now by hand

270
00:40:30,764 --> 00:40:32,015
That's all. You keep my hand

271
00:40:37,729 --> 00:40:42,025
Don't play. O.K right. Tell What for
you now?

272
00:40:43,151 --> 00:40:44,944
You want know that I'm cleaning with
hand no? That's it no?

273
00:40:45,653 --> 00:40:49,741
Why are you confusing in English for
this? This is not a new technique...

274
00:40:49,949 --> 00:40:55,372
It is from the period of Ramayana. How
did Raman go to Sri Lanka?

275
00:40:57,207 --> 00:41:01,294
That is Hanuman. I know. Do you
know? He went building bridge only no?

276
00:41:01,961 --> 00:41:06,424
What did do the squirrel at that time? It
helped. What did Raman tell for that?

277
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:09,719
He told thanks. How would be English
language at that period?

278
00:41:11,221 --> 00:41:14,933
Raman took the squirrel in hand and
rubbed with love.

279
00:41:15,934 --> 00:41:22,107
Squirrel, which was ash in color till then
got 3 lines at back and roaming till now

280
00:41:22,565 --> 00:41:28,363
O.K. So Why are you laughing?

281
00:41:30,448 --> 00:41:35,495
If this was the state of squirrel then what
would be Seetha's state?

282
00:41:42,335 --> 00:41:49,300
Leave that. We shall talk about us. I
didn't talk about that. I talked about this

283
00:41:49,884 --> 00:41:54,055
Could you tell this directly no? You
spoke Ramayana indirectly leaving this

284
00:42:22,459 --> 00:42:32,260
Girl! Are you a song of Madonna, a
model of Mumbai and image of Diana?

285
00:42:34,846 --> 00:42:44,689
Mum! Why you've Almoner's body,
Ajantha's love and a speed of Anaconda?

286
00:42:47,275 --> 00:42:52,489
Hey! The body is like a gypsy car and
sight speech like Pepsi

287
00:42:53,406 --> 00:42:58,578
The sight is like a mixer and party is too
sexy

288
00:42:59,537 --> 00:43:04,876
You're a crane, who came in water to
hoe a fish.

289
00:43:05,835 --> 00:43:09,297
You make me kick touching my body all
day

290
00:43:37,492 --> 00:43:46,668
Girl! Are you a song of Madonna, a
model of Mumbai and image of Diana?

291
00:43:49,045 --> 00:43:58,847
Mum! Why you've Almoner's body,
Ajantha's love and a speed of Anaconda?

292
00:44:01,057 --> 00:44:06,938
Hey! The body is like a gypsy car and
sight speech like Pepsi

293
00:44:07,605 --> 00:44:13,153
The sight is like a mixer and party is too
sexy

294
00:44:13,862 --> 00:44:19,367
You're a crane which came in water to
hoe a fish

295
00:44:20,118 --> 00:44:25,540
You make me kick touching my body all
day

296
00:45:09,793 --> 00:45:14,881
I'm the secret energy boost and all

297
00:45:15,924 --> 00:45:20,595
I'm the cause for you to become a
complan boy

298
00:45:21,930 --> 00:45:32,941
A kiss which kept silently will give
sweetness like a Cadburys chocolate

299
00:45:34,025 --> 00:45:38,863
There is no need for zip for the lips to
join together

300
00:45:39,948 --> 00:45:45,078
Is there any difference if I sing?

301
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:56,715
Girl! Are you a song of Madonna, a
model of Mumbai and image of Diana?

302
00:45:59,134 --> 00:46:09,060
Mum! Why you've Almoner's body,
Ajantha's love and a speed of Anaconda?

303
00:47:03,656 --> 00:47:07,202
My blood pressure will increase if you
come close to me

304
00:47:08,995 --> 00:47:13,583
Tensions will be minimized if I leave
my shyness

305
00:47:14,209 --> 00:47:19,756
If I keep my hand on you like a
keyboard

306
00:47:21,049 --> 00:47:26,179
My body is a musical tune produced by
that

307
00:47:27,138 --> 00:47:31,726
I've seen the major scale and minor scale
in you

308
00:47:33,103 --> 00:47:36,564
You sing about me.

309
00:47:46,658 --> 00:47:55,875
Mum! Why you've Almoner's body,
Ajantha's love and a speed of Anaconda?

310
00:47:58,712 --> 00:48:08,346
Girl! Are you a song of Madonna, a
model of Mumbai and image of Diana?

311
00:48:10,432 --> 00:48:16,354
You're a crane which came in water to
hoe a fish

312
00:48:17,147 --> 00:48:22,402
You make me kick touching my body all
day

313
00:48:23,153 --> 00:48:28,616
Hey! The body is like a gypsy car and
sight speech like Pepsi

314
00:48:29,284 --> 00:48:34,998
The sight is like a mixer and party is too
sexy

315
00:49:06,404 --> 00:49:09,449
What are you laying down? It is time for
college. Didn't you start?

316
00:49:10,367 --> 00:49:18,124
Lover! Lover! How is this topic? It's
superb. Did you keep this name for painting?

317
00:49:19,084 --> 00:49:21,586
What is the meaning in it? See! There
are 2 blue colors

318
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:25,048
Isn't it seems to be a loving girl calls her
lover as lover?

319
00:49:28,885 --> 00:49:32,972
See! There is a yellow color in between.
Two girls love a same person

320
00:49:34,265 --> 00:49:36,726
So both are calling as lover separately

321
00:49:40,522 --> 00:49:44,943
Is this a painting drawn by Lingam?
Yes. How do you get? He himself gave

322
00:49:45,902 --> 00:49:49,364
Did he give him self? If needed I'll
introduce you.

323
00:49:49,864 --> 00:49:54,994
You also get a painting. You'll
introduce. Those are all completely already

324
00:49:59,332 --> 00:50:04,546
Do you know him? You've got only
painting. But o got painter

325
00:50:05,588 --> 00:50:10,051
What are you telling? Yes. You've the
paintings of lingam no?

326
00:50:10,635 --> 00:50:17,475
I'm having lingam itself. You can love
Lingam

327
00:50:17,892 --> 00:50:20,645
But lingam loves me alone and told I love
you to me only

328
00:50:21,146 --> 00:50:25,483
What are you blabbering? Lingam loves
me and told I love you to me only

329
00:50:26,901 --> 00:50:31,614
We have been cheated. That lingam
tried to pick two mangoes in one shot itself

330
00:50:32,407 --> 00:50:33,908
Come We will see two in one

331
00:50:40,206 --> 00:50:42,792
You paint it Am I painter? You're
the painter

332
00:50:43,126 --> 00:50:46,796
Did I tell you to paint Ajanta painting? I
told to paint shelf only.

333
00:50:47,130 --> 00:50:51,217
I'd take bath. If you paint after bathing
then it will fall on you

334
00:50:52,552 --> 00:50:57,640
Before you finishing all can pour oil and
enjoy Deewali itself you paint it.

335
00:51:07,984 --> 00:51:11,571
He is here. What he is doing? He is
painting is he painting?

336
00:51:11,905 --> 00:51:20,372
You go I'll come yes He is
painting Move. What? I'd see

337
00:51:24,042 --> 00:51:28,672
You go No you go

338
00:51:37,263 --> 00:51:44,020
Come Is what I'm seeing dream or
real? It is paint

339
00:51:44,729 --> 00:51:51,069
Is my arrival too much of surprise?
No I dreamt about you in the morning only

340
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:53,154
All says that early morning's dream
won't be true

341
00:51:53,947 --> 00:51:55,782
But you made it true coming clearly

342
00:51:55,990 --> 00:51:57,826
you're not an ordinary Sundari
You're dream Sundari

343
00:51:58,159 --> 00:51:59,369
What are you seeing?

344
00:52:00,036 --> 00:52:03,873
Are you seeing and thinking a big painter
painting shelf wearing half trouser?

345
00:52:04,457 --> 00:52:07,711
What is the wrong in it? Painting will be
finished as well as shelf also become white

346
00:52:08,044 --> 00:52:09,170
There are two mangoes in one shot
itself

347
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:26,896
Tell again. There are two mangoes in
one shot itself Did you hear?

348
00:52:28,148 --> 00:52:33,069
Tell again. I can say 1000 times also if
you ask. There are 2 mangoes in 1 shot

349
00:52:35,071 --> 00:52:39,784
You came at first to my home. Can you
eat anything? No need

350
00:52:40,618 --> 00:52:46,833
Leave if you don't need. You tell. I'll
tell. It is getting late for college to me

351
00:52:47,584 --> 00:52:56,718
We will meet at 6'o clock in drive in.
We will meet. Is it paining?

352
00:53:01,139 --> 00:53:06,478
She is going bending like a thunder
What happened?

353
00:53:06,895 --> 00:53:09,647
You told that there are 2 mangoes in 1
shot? He also told that only

354
00:53:09,939 --> 00:53:14,110
What is in face as white? All can apply
charcoal in face.

355
00:53:14,778 --> 00:53:17,489
But he applied white in my face We
should not leave him.

356
00:53:17,781 --> 00:53:21,159
Don't forget 6'o clock and drive in

357
00:53:30,669 --> 00:53:37,092
If it is 6'o clock then why he is shying?
Will it surprise to you?

358
00:53:37,967 --> 00:53:41,805
I thought bout you now only. Don't tell.

359
00:53:42,681 --> 00:53:44,766
Before you finish saying I will complete

360
00:53:46,768 --> 00:53:50,939
You're a big painter. What, you're
painting for shelf and all?

361
00:53:51,398 --> 00:53:56,945
Work for work. I'll tell work for work
for work and shelf also becomes white

362
00:53:57,529 --> 00:54:00,990
If say shortly then it's like two mangoes
in one shot itself

363
00:54:02,492 --> 00:54:08,081
There are 2 mangoes in 1 shot itself. Are
you telling it to me also?

364
00:54:08,623 --> 00:54:15,422
Can we change the old saying? Can you
come driven at 6'o clock today?

365
00:54:16,631 --> 00:54:22,012
I've another appointment. Another
appointment? Can't you change for me?

366
00:54:22,429 --> 00:54:30,437
It's money matter. I spent it. What are
you telling now? I'll come by 8'o clock

367
00:54:31,438 --> 00:54:39,446
Don't you change? I won't change with
promise on paint.

368
00:54:43,783 --> 00:54:52,250
Is it blocking to you also? Did he apply
white for you also?

369
00:54:53,710 --> 00:54:57,255
He told as 2 mangoes in 1 shot? Did he
tell? You'll be sad if I tell another thing

370
00:54:58,006 --> 00:55:05,680
What? He tells that he loves you for
money. He is going to meet you for currency

371
00:55:10,852 --> 00:55:15,815
I know that you'd come. Do you need
once more? 2 mangoes in 1 shot

372
00:55:18,318 --> 00:55:24,991
No need of 6'o clock today. Can you
come by 8'o clock? You can't

373
00:55:25,241 --> 00:55:34,751
Why? I know. You'd roam with Janaki.
Who is that Janaki? Who is that Janaki?

374
00:55:38,630 --> 00:55:45,011
Who is she? Don't act Who is he?
Don't act

375
00:55:45,804 --> 00:55:49,432
You say younger dad of Paryati is
Lingam hearing Sivan story full night

376
00:55:50,642 --> 00:55:55,814
He is Lingam who cheated us. Did
anybody call me?

377
00:55:57,774 --> 00:55:58,692
Why are you calling him as Lingam?

378
00:55:59,150 --> 00:56:04,030
Why I'd not call him when you call him
as Lingam? I can't understand anything

379
00:56:04,864 --> 00:56:09,703
I understood. This is my Sundari This
is my Janaki

380
00:56:10,704 --> 00:56:19,796
Don't you understand? This is because
me and Sundari, you and Janaki joined

381
00:56:23,591 --> 00:56:27,303
You're the painter in these no? You're
having brush in hand. He is also having

382
00:56:27,512 --> 00:56:35,520
He is having in mouth. Who is painter in
this? Then what about you?

383
00:56:38,523 --> 00:56:45,780
What is this like a calendar painting? I
don't want. It's not for you

384
00:56:47,282 --> 00:56:56,583
What are you doing? What is this? Go

385
00:56:57,792 --> 00:57:04,507
Do you know? I sold paint like this only.
Is it? You're creator and I'm cleaner

386
00:57:05,592 --> 00:57:11,097
Did you understand? We are not bad
boys as you thought

387
00:57:12,182 --> 00:57:19,272
All for these children. Tell now. Do
you've love on us or not now?

388
00:57:19,981 --> 00:57:28,156
What you're telling that twice? We are 2
no? Do you give value for love or money?

389
00:57:28,782 --> 00:57:35,372
Not both. What you're confusing? It's
marriage. What you're?

390
00:57:35,872 --> 00:57:41,419
We have more money no? We will build
big Orphanage and join many children

391
00:57:41,961 --> 00:57:45,382
Yes. We will marry and give birth to
many orphan children

392
00:57:46,216 --> 00:57:49,803
How it will be orphan if we give birth?
These children itself are not orphan

393
00:57:54,140 --> 00:57:58,269
What is your name? I forgot when you
touched. My name is T. Murugan

394
00:58:08,238 --> 00:58:10,615
We are not Orphans. We had 2 brothers
till yesterday.

395
00:58:11,491 --> 00:58:15,370
But from today 2 sister in law's also
added See the shyness

396
00:58:16,579 --> 00:58:20,375
What, you're without sighting taking to
beach, cinema separately

397
00:58:20,875 --> 00:58:25,672
and talking in between children? See
the shyness there

398
00:58:29,175 --> 00:58:32,387
If you talk too much like this then I'll.

399
00:58:36,099 --> 00:58:40,270
A king of silver mountain! You're the
Veda

400
00:58:41,396 --> 00:58:53,908
A king of silver mountain! You told we
have to go to Kandhan Karunai film

401
00:58:54,409 --> 00:59:00,331
I thought you as a big devotee. I
understood later only for what that was

402
00:59:01,541 --> 00:59:11,509
It is understood at front also Is she or
she who laughs like a bell of telephone?

403
00:59:18,892 --> 00:59:20,435
Who is that? Dad is speaking

404
00:59:23,605 --> 00:59:28,735
Ask as where are you? I was in San
Francisco in the morning. Now at Chicago

405
00:59:31,071 --> 00:59:35,617
Another important matter than this is
I'm coming madras a day in this month

406
00:59:37,660 --> 00:59:41,122
Ask as why are you coming? I'm
coming regarding your marriage only

407
00:59:42,165 --> 00:59:46,294
If do your marriage with a good boy
then I can roam happily

408
00:59:46,961 --> 00:59:50,632
you don't worry about that. I've seen a
good Son-in-law to you

409
00:59:52,884 --> 01:00:00,141
How is that boy? He is very beautiful
Are we with ears and neck alone?

410
01:00:00,934 --> 01:00:05,105
Is he having money? Is he a rich? He is
asking that you're a rich.

411
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:12,112
Tell the truth I can't say truth Say
the truth you speak

412
01:00:13,655 --> 01:00:20,829
I'm rich man speaking. I'm Ram lingam
speaking. I'm Balamurugan

413
01:00:21,204 --> 01:00:25,250
All will call me as Murugan shortly. All
will call me as Lingam

414
01:00:26,084 --> 01:00:32,215
What are you doing now? I'm building!
Do you mean building?

415
01:00:33,925 --> 01:00:36,761
You can say that also. That also means
you've more other business

416
01:00:37,387 --> 01:00:43,893
Will your turnover be 2 crores? 1 crore
in this side & 1 crore in that

417
01:00:44,561 --> 01:00:51,526
It's not enough. I've only daughter. My
worries are about her marriage only

418
01:00:52,068 --> 01:00:55,447
Because I'm roaming throughout the
country no? I'm also roaming

419
01:00:55,572 --> 01:01:01,286
You can see if you come. I'll come. I'd
meet you when I come to Madras

420
01:01:01,453 --> 01:01:09,461
Have you decided to come? Yes. O.K.
Uncle. He himself told as Son-in-law

421
01:01:20,263 --> 01:01:22,724
What you're saying as Swamiye
Saranam lyyappa seeing Murugan?

422
01:01:23,683 --> 01:01:28,438
What if it's Subrmaniya Swami or
gopal All are Swami only

423
01:01:28,772 --> 01:01:32,233
Ramasami also Swami you're
confusing.

424
01:01:32,650 --> 01:01:36,029
My work is confusing only. I know that
only

425
01:01:36,154 --> 01:01:41,242
What I can do if tells as don't do that
too? You're too worse

426
01:01:58,259 --> 01:02:02,847
Parama Sivam! Come here What my
dad?

427
01:02:03,306 --> 01:02:10,271
Your daughter who is reading In college
fell on love and roaming with a man

428
01:02:10,689 --> 01:02:18,697
Is it true? I saw with my 12 eyes. My
duty is giving caution to you. I did it

429
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:25,912
Go. Do anything immediately. What?
What happened?

430
01:02:27,122 --> 01:02:31,042
I dreamt a bad dream about our
daughter. Is it about spoil of our daughter?

431
01:02:31,418 --> 01:02:35,588
I think that she didn't go till that limit.
My dad Murugan came in Varadachari's image

432
01:02:36,464 --> 01:02:45,098
This is Varadachari only How do you
know that I'm speaking?

433
01:02:45,598 --> 01:02:46,891
I know What is the matter?

434
01:02:47,559 --> 01:02:50,645
Your daughter Janaki who is reading in
Madras

435
01:02:51,271 --> 01:02:53,106
She is roaming with some body. That is
it no? How do you know?

436
01:02:53,648 --> 01:02:58,445
I know everything. Murugan told. Did
Murugan tell all to you already?

437
01:02:58,778 --> 01:03:02,907
You keep down the phone I'll take
care What? Who is in the phone?

438
01:03:03,408 --> 01:03:06,953
Our Varadachari only. My dad
Murugan's sayings became true What?

439
01:03:07,412 --> 01:03:12,167
Janaki loves someone. Janaki is not such
a girl

440
01:03:12,542 --> 01:03:15,670
What a work for these lawyers. They
won't sleep without make fight on both sides

441
01:03:16,129 --> 01:03:19,841
Don't tell like this about him. He can
today say that which will happen tomorrow

442
01:03:20,258 --> 01:03:29,059
You don't know about him But I
know What uncle? Give Thanthi

443
01:03:29,601 --> 01:03:34,647
Keep this Thanthi. Not Daily Thanthi.
Go and give telegram Why?

444
01:03:35,148 --> 01:03:40,111
Go give a telegram urgently to Janaki as
Paryahti's health is worse

445
01:03:41,071 --> 01:03:46,409
Sister was fine no? Wait I've one
doubt What? Janaki is improper

446
01:03:47,202 --> 01:03:50,413
She loves somebody. Is it so? How do
you know that?

447
01:03:50,747 --> 01:03:54,542
If Murugan for you then brain for me.
That's security Singaram. Do you know?

448
01:03:55,043 --> 01:03:58,963
Go. Go and give telegram. Why uncle
is so hot?

449
01:04:15,814 --> 01:04:19,401
What is this? You came without imp
forming. There is nothing for you no?

450
01:04:19,818 --> 01:04:21,236
Nothing for me. I'm fine.

451
01:04:21,861 --> 01:04:24,948
No I received a telegram that you're
not well and serious

452
01:04:25,615 --> 01:04:28,702
Is it telegram? Who gave? Is it
telegram? I only gave

453
01:04:29,661 --> 01:04:33,206
I've a doubt. Did I give the telegram no?
Fool! You gave by my saying no?

454
01:04:33,540 --> 01:04:37,919
Yes. What a game is this? Why you
gave telegram? Telegram is for roomer

455
01:04:38,753 --> 01:04:41,214
What are you telling? I'm saying the
truth only sister

456

457
01:04:46,594 --> 01:04:51,558
So we gave that your health is not fine.
Dad! What are all these worse? Worse

458
01:04:52,267 --> 01:04:55,562
If we sent Madras to read you roamed
with some man

doubt then itself. You've won

mistake

461
01:05:07,574 --> 01:05:12,871
All are talking confusingly. Mum! I
understood about what they are talking

462
01:05:13,955 --> 01:05:19,544
I thought to talk with you in contact.
You called by telegram before that

463
01:05:20,545 --> 01:05:23,673
I'm loving a person. I'm going to marry
him only

464
01:05:24,341 --> 01:05:28,803
You're telling a man no? Who is he?
Who are his parents? Is he a rich man?

465
01:05:29,888 --> 01:05:35,310
He is an orphan. He don't have parents
and wealth also He is poor

466
01:05:36,102 --> 01:05:42,817
So he is a man without anything. He is
an empty man. Is that so?

467
01:05:44,444 --> 01:05:47,989
Is he a Ravivarma? He draws for
calendar. Very good

468
01:05:48,782 --> 01:05:54,329
Daily you tare the date in calendar,
starye for food and spent the days Is it so?

469
01:05:55,121 --> 01:05:58,416
No. He told that he would save me all
over the life without tears.

470
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:02,712
Do you believe that? Yes. Though his
words blocks, he won't change from his promise.

and handicap also See here!

472
01:06:09,928 --> 01:06:14,140
If you marry him then you won't get
single paise from my wealth

473
01:06:15,892 --> 01:06:20,188
See! If you want to call me as dad again
then you'd forget that love

474
01:06:20,563 --> 01:06:22,482
you say like that. Now only you're
my uncle.

475
01:06:33,243 --> 01:06:35,370

01:06:46,297 --> 01:06:52,887
This is bride. He is groom who is
shying. Our marriage is afterwards only

What a noise? He has beaten him. He is
kindling me as stumbling mouth

480
01:07:26,421 --> 01:07:35,722
Sinner! He is a stumbling mouth man
really. How? Is it from birth?

481
01:07:37,349 --> 01:07:46,566
What about you? I was proper till 20
years. But then when I was taking bath

482
01:07:48,193 --> 01:08:02,832
Did you fall? My mum fell and died. By
that attack. Why you didn't go doctor

483
01:08:03,917 --> 01:08:13,176

Friends would laugh thrice while
sending for first night you can go

What? There is no door. There is curtain
only. You adjust it

01:10:31,481 --> 01:10:36,444
Without lock We can put pin instead
of lock

502
01:10:37,779 --> 01:10:40,323
This is the saying that girl's mind is
always backward

503
01:10:40,907 --> 01:10:46,287
If some body seen then? I'll see. I'm

01:11:34,002 --> 01:11:39,549
For my mum. Is it for mum? Why?

509
01:11:39,924 --> 01:11:45,138
You fought with them and came no? I
fought with my dad not with mum

510
01:11:45,347 --> 01:11:49,059
Show me. I won't. Why you'd not show
me?

511
01:11:49,601 --> 01:11:52,937
There will be 1000 matters In between
mum and daughter. They are no need to you

512
01:11:53,146 --> 01:12:02,572
You can go. Great mum and great
daughter

513
01:12:37,107 --> 01:12:41,778
Our Janaki wrote a letter that her
husband got a big job in big advertising agency

514
01:12:41,903 --> 01:12:43,196
He is earning too much of salary

515
01:12:46,282 --> 01:12:49,369
Laila will sight lightly

516
01:12:50,954 --> 01:12:55,041
My heart will beat at a high speed as
Lup tup

517
01:12:55,667 --> 01:12:59,087
She will sight with left and right eyes

518
01:13:00,463 --> 01:13:04,634
My song will be formed saying as

01:13:05,385 --> 01:13:13,435
Your song is hit for me also. Younger

520
01:13:14,519 --> 01:13:19,691

Our Son-in-law bought a big bang law
in city.

526
01:13:49,471 --> 01:13:51,681
There is a swimming pool in bang law
also for bathing

527
01:14:36,309 --> 01:14:43,942
Can't a steel sing guitar come thinking
that my finger's nails will play it?

528
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:53,201
Can't a happiness arise if we stand in
snow daily at night?

529
01:15:04,004 --> 01:15:11,261
Is it a younger flower? Is the cheeks are
like a soft shell? Is it brown in color?

530
01:15:13,138 --> 01:15:20,437
Our marriage happened and Villains are
gone. There will be a love duet on bed here after

534
01:16:20,163 --> 01:16:28,254
Are you that man who pinches the fold
in the small hip of moon?

535
01:16:39,599 --> 01:16:47,107
I've come with excitement. Am I a sage

Go Post it and come For whom this
letter is? I told to post it

548
01:18:39,386 --> 01:18:43,598
There is great valuable in foreign for our
Son-in-law's drawings

549
01:18:44,099 --> 01:18:50,271
They earning so much of money
Drawings of her husband may valued in foreign

550
01:18:50,814 --> 01:18:55,276
But this Paramecia won't respect him
Prestige is most important to me

551
01:18:55,860 --> 01:19:01,533
you understand that. What are you? She
is keep on writing from 6 months

552
01:19:02,117 --> 01:19:04,577
Though we didn't go and see, we can send
a reply letter no?

553
01:19:06,913 --> 01:19:12,585
Why are you crying for this? All dads
will be like this at 1st. All will be O.K. in future

554
01:19:13,253 --> 01:19:18,174
How it will be O.K? I'm keep on writing
letter from past 1 year

555
01:19:19,134 --> 01:19:23,221
But I didn't receive reply for any letter.
You don't know about my dad

556
01:19:24,514 --> 01:19:27,559
Daughter is not important for him. His
prestige is important for him

557
01:19:27,726 --> 01:19:30,812
O.K. I'll accept that daughter is not
important for your dad

558
01:19:31,479 --> 01:19:36,151
But if he knows that a grand son is
going to born to him then he may run and come

559
01:19:38,069 --> 01:19:43,199
What are you saying? If a baby is going
to What going to?

560
01:19:43,908 --> 01:19:48,121
1 year is passed from your marriage no?
You write a letter that baby was born already

561
01:19:48,913 --> 01:19:52,542
See then where will be your dad's
prestige. What are you saying?

562
01:19:56,171 --> 01:20:01,509
Do you think that this Parama sivam
will stand on the entrance of that bang law

563
01:20:01,718 --> 01:20:05,680
without shy if she gave birth to a
baby? Prestige is important to me

564
01:20:06,681 --> 01:20:13,104
She might be mum, her husband might
be dad and but I didn't become grandpa

565
01:20:13,938 --> 01:20:17,692
Now also I tell that she is not daughter,
her husband is not my Son-in-law

566
01:20:18,401 --> 01:20:25,200
That baby is not grand son. What
happened to you?

567
01:20:25,825 --> 01:20:32,999
I've made a mistake. It's too many since
child had taken birth. I'm a great sinner

568
01:20:33,541 --> 01:20:37,462
What are you talking? What then? Did a
baby take birth?

569
01:20:37,754 --> 01:20:41,049
A grandson only born to me. I'd not say
that

570
01:20:41,424 --> 01:20:45,553
Would not you at least tell? If I became
grandpa then you became grandma

571
01:20:46,137 --> 01:20:49,933
Go. Go and write reply to Janaki
O.K.

572
01:20:52,686 --> 01:20:56,272
Letter has come from dad. How an idea
that I told?

573
01:20:56,690 --> 01:20:59,651
There is problem by your idea only
what happened?

574
01:20:59,984 --> 01:21:03,697
I wrote a letter that I'm rich and baby has
born like that

575
01:21:04,072 --> 01:21:06,324
He sent reply letter that he is going to
see his grandson now

576
01:21:06,741 --> 01:21:10,995
If come and ask for Baby, car and bang law
then what can I answer?

577
01:21:11,746 --> 01:21:14,124
You write another letter stating that
whatever you told so far are lies

578
01:21:14,582 --> 01:21:17,711
& I wrote like that to console you
only

579
01:21:19,045 --> 01:21:22,298
When my dad comes to know that
grandson is born by this happy shock

580
01:21:22,841 --> 01:21:26,136
my dad is blabbering as he's made a
mistake, like that my mum wrote.

581
01:21:27,137 --> 01:21:31,349
If he knows that these are lie then that's
all. This is a danger for his sole itself

582
01:21:32,726 --> 01:21:37,397
Is it so? What can we do now? What
you told that when will your dad comes?

583
01:21:38,106 --> 01:21:42,944
He will come on 14th. He will stay 14th,
- 15th and platter grandson.

584
01:21:43,570 --> 01:21:44,571
He will go to city on 16th

585
01:21:45,822 --> 01:21:48,908
There is a bang law named Noor mahal
in Mahabali Puram road.

586
01:21:49,367 --> 01:21:53,121
They can hire that for film shooting. We
take that bang law as hire for 2 days

587
01:21:53,788 --> 01:21:57,334
We can take car, furniture and all for hire.
I'll arrange

588
01:21:57,876 --> 01:22:03,173
That's O.K. Baby? See! All will be got
if we give money in this city

589
01:22:16,770 --> 01:22:21,608
What happened? My dad is going to
come here to see my rich Lingam

590
01:22:22,901 --> 01:22:27,781
We have to book that Noor Mahal not
- 14th and 15th. We have to book 13th also

591
01:22:31,326 --> 01:22:36,289
Son Paramasivam! Are you going to
Madras on 14th? No need

592
01:22:36,706 --> 01:22:40,460
Listen to me who is your dad. There is
danger in north on 14th

593
01:22:41,044 --> 01:22:43,338
You start & go on 13th itself

594
01:22:49,719 --> 01:22:54,933
Did we plan to go Madras on 14th and see
our grandson or not? Yes

595
01:22:55,433 --> 01:23:01,231
Murugan came in dream and told that no
need of 14th. Go by 13th itself

596
01:23:01,898 --> 01:23:09,197
Can we see our small grandson soon?
Yes. Who is that? Is that astrologer?

597
01:23:09,364 --> 01:23:16,663
I'll come now Come astrologer. Good

What? How is your health? I heard

599
01:23:23,503 --> 01:23:29,259
You'd not tell anything. Don't go 14th.
There is a danger in north

600
01:23:29,634 --> 01:23:33,722
You're coming to tell us to go by 13th
itself. Is that no? How do you know that?

601
01:23:34,222 --> 01:23:40,603
You may know only an awl. But I know
Arumugam. My dad told already

602
01:23:49,195 --> 01:23:50,947
There is a dining table at ground floor
no? Keep it there

603
01:23:51,573 --> 01:23:59,205
There is a hall in upstairs no? Keep
there Keep this chair at that side

01:24:01,624 --> 01:24:06,254
You came so late. Get down. No. I

606
01:24:19,017 --> 01:24:23,438
Here You told as 20. You're a big
genius of mathematics. Tell.

607
01:24:23,646 --> 01:24:28,360
50 means 20 only. You told already no?
I'm telling from front only

608
01:24:30,737 --> 01:24:34,199
Why you're too late? What everyone is
scolding? I didn't say you

609
01:24:34,366 --> 01:24:41,039
I told him. The watchman I told him is
he only. Why you're committing watchman?

610
01:24:41,456 --> 01:24:46,252
Won't there be a watchman for home?
All are just setup no? I didn't mean you

611
01:24:47,128 --> 01:24:51,049
If he tells the truth to Sundari's dad
when he comes? Did Sundari's dad know Hindi?

612
01:24:51,424 --> 01:24:56,179
No. Then leave it. I don't that he knows
or not

613
01:24:56,888 --> 01:25:05,480
Do watchman know English? Do you
know English or not? I don't know

614
01:25:07,524 --> 01:25:13,988
But I know Tamil. Don't worry sir. I
won't talk too much. Valluvar told.

615
01:25:14,197 --> 01:25:19,494
All should control their tongue. If not
they will suffer

616
01:25:21,788 --> 01:25:24,624
How he knew! It's a goodness topic

617
01:25:27,544 --> 01:25:33,258
somehow home is settled up including
dog. That 20000 Rs. which I told

618
01:25:35,593 --> 01:25:42,308
Can't you reduce? I didn't mean the
dog. I told you

619
01:25:48,857 --> 01:25:55,905
I'll try better than that money which
is got by selling dog is barking give

620
01:25:56,656 --> 01:26:02,537
A useless group. That man is going to
come trusting this from Chicago.

621
01:26:03,079 --> 01:26:05,290
Where are you going? Did you ask
while going? See!

622
01:26:05,874 --> 01:26:09,085
I'll go hostel directly now and ask
Whether Sundari arranged baby or not

623
01:26:09,711 --> 01:26:13,089
From there I'll go bus stand, meet
Lingam and say how to talk and act

624
01:26:13,214 --> 01:26:14,924
on 14th, 15th when my dad come

625
01:26:15,383 --> 01:26:19,220
Sundari will go airport directly and come
here Do you understand?

626
01:26:19,429 --> 01:26:24,684
Nothing is understood. Didn't you
understand? I told in me to from you.

627
01:26:24,893 --> 01:26:27,395
You'd tell that in you no? You told me
and confused

628
01:26:27,896 --> 01:26:31,941
Sundari's dad's name is Soola Karuppan
no? Balamurugan only

629
01:26:32,067 --> 01:26:33,610
Did you see? Sundari's dad then Soola
Karuppan can come

630
01:26:34,611 --> 01:26:36,488
If it's Bandiri's dad then Balamurugan
can come

631
01:26:37,030 --> 01:26:39,824
Leave Balan. He himself says him as
Murugan.

632
01:26:40,158 --> 01:26:42,619
You also tell Murugan till he comes.

633
01:26:43,119 --> 01:26:46,373
You can get goodness and remain uncle's
name in addition to that

634
01:26:46,831 --> 01:26:52,545
What Sundari's dad's wife? You can say
as sundari's mum no?

635
01:26:53,213 --> 01:26:57,342
you don't worry. He don't have wife.
How Sundari born without wife?

636
01:26:58,176 --> 01:27:03,348
she died before 10 years. If I knew that
then I'd sell 1 painting there also

637
01:27:03,473 --> 01:27:12,816
Where? Was it in Chicago? Keep calm.
House owner Noorjahan is coming

638
01:27:13,566 --> 01:27:15,402
You may tell anything to her. She may
ask as why

639
01:27:21,157 --> 01:27:27,997
Come. You're telling. Your rent? I gave
- 30000 Rs. for 3 days already.

640
01:27:28,248 --> 01:27:32,210
I came to return that. How big heart!
Are you telling us to stay freely?

641
01:27:32,627 --> 01:27:36,673
Keep quite brother. I don't leave this for
hire to you. You vacate the home

642
01:27:36,840 --> 01:27:41,803
What is this? You're giving shock. I can
used to give this home for shooting

643
01:27:42,637 --> 01:27:46,975
You told that your parents are going to
come. I also gave without knowing

644
01:27:47,142 --> 01:27:51,396
Now Meharunisa's dad is scolding. Who
is Meharunisa? She is my daughter

645
01:27:53,273 --> 01:27:57,402
she pinched. What can do without
pinching? A party came last month like this

646
01:27:58,069 --> 01:28:01,823
Police and raid are took place They
played pinching like this only

647
01:28:02,115 --> 01:28:05,785
You vacate it What are you saying
wrongly? Am I like that?

648
01:28:05,910 --> 01:28:09,456
See the wedding chain. What you're
standing calmly? Wedding chain only

649
01:28:09,914 --> 01:28:15,462
Do you trust at least now? O.K. Husband
and wife are showing wedding chain

650
01:28:16,296 --> 01:28:21,092

Dharga on 13th, 14th and 15th

651
01:28:21,509 --> 01:28:27,766
I'll come on 16th. Will you vacate the
home? There will be a shooting

652
01:28:28,141 --> 01:28:33,772
I'll come Actors are going to come
We our self that only

653
01:28:35,857 --> 01:28:40,695
Somehow we've tackled Shajahan. Is
that Shajahan? Noorjahan

654
01:28:40,987 --> 01:28:44,574
Why are you forgetting like this?
Memory power is high for me

655
01:29:01,466 --> 01:29:04,386
Don't forget. I'm going.

656
01:29:12,394 --> 01:29:16,564
All would be ready when your dad
comes. I'll pick up dad and come there

657
01:29:16,981 --> 01:29:19,401
O.K. What happened to baby? Why do
you worry for that?

658
01:29:19,859 --> 01:29:36,001
I told that I'll arrange that today itself
no? Is it no? Why? What happened?

659
01:29:36,584 --> 01:29:38,837
Like usual only. Dad didn't come in that
flight

660
01:29:39,170 --> 01:29:42,007
He told that he would phone and tell that
when he would come

661
01:29:42,507 --> 01:29:46,261
O.K You go and arrange a baby. I'll go
bus stand and receive Lingam

662
01:29:46,845 --> 01:29:51,307
He is coming from Sivakasi today. I'd
teach how to act when my dad comes

663
01:29:55,270 --> 01:29:58,690
What are you telling? That alone.
You're saying that you can't

664
01:29:59,899 --> 01:30:03,153
why did you tell lie without asking me?
What a big lie?

665
01:30:03,403 --> 01:30:06,740
Did I tell for me? I told for you only. I
told that your Son-in-law is rich

666
01:30:07,323 --> 01:30:10,326
He would save me without tears. Is
that wrong?

667
01:30:10,493 --> 01:30:13,913
Though why you told that baby has
born? I didn't tell that myself

668
01:30:14,039 --> 01:30:20,211
Sundari told. You alone told that. What
ever you say as sir

669
01:30:21,046 --> 01:30:29,429
What? You left crackers in bus itself. I
went to sell calendar design in Sivakasi

670
01:30:29,763 --> 01:30:34,726
They didn't give money Leave
those If I leave they will fall down

671
01:30:34,893 --> 01:30:40,982
will you act as rich son in-law to my dad
now or not? Lie Me? Can't

672
01:30:41,274 --> 01:30:48,239
I'll tackle my dad saying lie. What will
you? If he asks where is Son-in-law then

673
01:30:48,656 --> 01:30:49,574
I'd say that he went to Sivakasi to sell
calendar design

674
01:30:49,699 --> 01:30:56,164
4 days will take him to return. Fool!
Can any rich man go to sell calendar design?

675
01:31:11,304 --> 01:31:14,974
In some case If you want to come
changing your mind. Noor mahal.

676
01:31:15,433 --> 01:31:17,268
Mahabali Puram Road. Don't forget
