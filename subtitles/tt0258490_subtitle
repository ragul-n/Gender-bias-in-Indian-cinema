You know Sidhu, right?

They are searching you.

00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:09,840
If they get you they will
cut you into pieces.

75
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,260
Listen to me and run
away from this city.

76
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:16,260

''But my heart is Indian.''

82
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:41,380
Greetings, brother Gorak. Greetings.

83

Did you recognize me?

84
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,860
You heard about me but
you did not see me.

85
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,080
And the person you are searching..

86
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:54,780
..Sidhu Siddhartha Roy, it is me.

87
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,700
Munna, two cups of tea.
- In a moment.

88
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:08,120
Brother, the thing is that we
do not let outsiders interfere..

89
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,040
..in our college matters.

90
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,840
That day we tried to..

91
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,420
..to explain this to your boys.

92
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:19,780
Brother, forget listening us,
they started beating..

93
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,860
And to stop your boys
we had to beat them.

94
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:31,440
Brother, I apologize to you
for whatever happened.

95
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,920
Brother Gorak, Lets settle
this matter amicably..

96
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:37,880
..right here right now.

97
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,460
And if we do not, you too know
what the result would be.

98
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:43,120
Think about It.

99
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,505
Hey, did you see Sidhu?
- No, I did not.

100
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:58,560
I heard a lot about you..

101
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,460
You are trying to get smart with me?

102
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:10,444
You hit brother?

103
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,500
Catch him.

104
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,020
This way.

00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,560
Hey, Look around.

106
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:06,240
Look that way.

107
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:13,520
Now ln Raj Kapoor's
golden melodies you will hear..

108
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,280
''I am everything, except
street-smart.''

109
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,300
Move. Move. Move.

Have to work hard.

112
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:42,280
Those with Long hair will
face some danger.

113
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:54,980
Hey, did you find Sidhu?

114
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:02,300
''I am a vagabond. I am a vagabond.''

115
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:06,140
''Or I am a star in the sky?''

116
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,020
The doctor said that..

117
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:16,860
You hit Briju?

118
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:17,856
Hey!

119
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:18,240
O Lord, they ruined my vegetables.

120
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,800
They ruined today's stock.

121
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,380
Enough. Enough. Leave me.

122
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,090
Grandpa, these vegetables are yours?

123
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,718
They are ruined.

124
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,655
What will I sell and
what will I eat?

125
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,480
What will I do now?

126
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,940
I am sorry.
- Thank you. - Thanks.

127
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,000

History began with fire.
Flare is power. Flare is Life.

00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,888
There is a spark in all of you
that no one can suppress.

139
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,400
The evil that will come close
to you will be burnt.

You all are flames. You all
are ever burning torches.

Keep on burning and leading the way.

143
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,460

144
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:35,140

177
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:37,500
Did you check the station properly?

178
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,060
Yes, I checked properly.
She hasn't come.

179
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:42,601
No. She said she would come today.

180
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,760
Hey, she is here.

181
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:23,932
Daddy.

182
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,721
Daddy.
- Hey, Bujjl!

183
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,640
Sir, please come.

184
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:50,060
Sir, as per Miss. Madhu's request..

185
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:52,140
..I made the arrangements
for the blood donation.

186
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,820
Hey, where is my daughter
donating blood?

187
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:54,520
Over there.

188
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:03,280
Hey!

189
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,540
Daddy. Daddy.

190
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,081
You dared to take
my daughter's blood. - What?

191
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,396
One minute, daddy. Listen to me.

192
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:11,944
Get that blood back into her body.
- Please, daddy.

193
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:14,000
Leave me, dear. Leave me, dear.
- Daddy. Daddy, please.

194
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,260
I will see his end.
- Daddy. - Leave me, dear.

195
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,260
I will see you later on.
- Daddy.

196
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:20,900
Donating blood is a good deed.

197
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,520
Come with me.

198
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,764
Mother Kali, please fulfil my wish.

199
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,560
Do not full fill my son's wish.

200
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:45,927
Please save him, Mother.
Please, Mother.

201
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:49,880
Mother, your preparations
are only to ruin my plans.

202
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:53,900
Please do not pray to spoil my plans.

203
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:55,680
Hey, why are you fighting
with your mom!

204
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,260
What else should I do, daddy!
She ls praying for..

205
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,480
..exactly opposite to
what I am praying for.

206
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:02,120
Poor God! if two members
from the same family..

207
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:04,100
..ask for two opposite things..
I want it and she does not want it.

208
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,396
God will fall in a dilemma.

209
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:10,000
But eventually he will fulfil my wish.
- Yes, sure. - Yes.

210
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,060
What did you pray for and what
did your mother pray for?

211
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:16,100
Nothing, daddy. I am praying
for going to Canada..

212
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,580
..for Master’s degree and
mother is praying..

213
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,740
..that I do not go there.
You know how difficult it is..

214
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,620
..to find a seat in that university.

215
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:23,240
You know what sort of brains
You need to get a seat there.

216
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,800
No matter what I am going there.

217
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,060
God, ruin his plans to go to Canada.

218
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,980
Hey, be careful, you might
Burn your hand. - Ok.

219
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,760
Daddy, I applied for the visa.

220
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,020
Do you have any objection if I
go to Canada for my studies?

221
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,260
No. No. No. Not at all.
- Then what's your problem?

222
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,700
What sort of a father are you!
- I would be very proud..

223
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,400
..If my sons goes abroad
for further studies. - Yes.

224
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,440
I cannot stay here without
you for five Long years.

225
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,973
Mom, it is not five Long years.
It's just five years.

226
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:50,460
One. Two. Three. Four. Five.
- No. - It is over.

227
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,720
No. - Mother, looking
at your sentiments..

228
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,640
..I would why I was not
born in Canada.

229
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,620
Look how happy father is.

230
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:01,978
Mother, when I can stay without
you for five years..

231
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,880
..cannot you stay without me
for five years? Please, mom.

232
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,822
No, I cannot stay here.

233
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:11,210
Look, daddy. - That is what is
called mother's sentiment.

234
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:13,852
Mother, not you, and
not eve Mother Kali..

235
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:16,474
..can stop me now.

236
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:23,240
What! You want to study further?
- Yes.

237
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,960
What yes! There are just a
few guys in our village..

238
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,460
..who are literate, and among
those no one agrees..

239
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,000
..to live in our house
after marriage..

240
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:32,140
Now if you study further where
will I search for a son-in-Law?

241
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:35,900
Son-in-Law? What for?
- To play marbles.

242
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,860
Daddy, why are you looking
for a son-in-law now?

243
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:41,036
I need to do MS. That is what
this application is for.

244
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:42,680
Sign here.

245
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:45,760
Sign here.

246
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,700
Come here. I will beat you up.

247
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,260
There are only four guys in this
province who studied till B.Sc.

248
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,400
And among them two guys marriage
is already fixed.

249
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,700
Subbaraju's son is going to foreign.

250
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,260
Now there is only Veeraraju's
son left.

251
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,360
Somehow I convinced them to live
at our place after wedding..

252
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:08,790
I called them here tomorrow
to see you.

253
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,500
What! You called them to see me?

254
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,520
Whom did you ask?
- Whom do I have to ask?

255
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,920
I will not accept it. I want
to study further. - Bujji.

256
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,984
Bujji dear, Listen to me.

257
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,800
You were born to us after
six years of prayers.

258
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:32,360
You are our only child.
If we get you married..

259
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,940
..at a far away place we cannot
live here in peace..

260
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,088
..worrying about you.
- Who is getting married..

261
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,000
..and going away now?
- If you study further..

262
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,600
..that is the situation
we will have to face.

263
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,121
That is why I talked
to Mr. Veeraraju..

264
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,460
..and called them here
tomorrow to see you.

265
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,220
Daddy, tell them not to come here.

266
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:48,580
I want to study further. Sign here.

267
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,200
I am shouting at the
top of my voice..

268
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,420
..and you are behaving as
if you did not even hear it?

269
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:07,960
Daddy, you tore the application
I brought?

270
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:11,220
Tomorrow the boy you choose
will come here.

271
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,460
Just keep on watching.
If I do not stone him..

272
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,140
..then I will change my name.

273
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:34,400
Dear, why are you parading
again instead of sleeping?

274
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:37,140
Come and sleep.
- I am not feeling sleepy.

275
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,120
It is 2 am and you are not
feeling sleepy?

276
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,704
I am not feeling sleepy.
You sleep quietly.

277
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,596
My daughter must say yes to the wedding.

278
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:30,740
My daughter must say yes to the wedding.

279
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:31,900
My daughter must say yes to the wedding.

280
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,020
My daughter must say yes to the wedding.

281
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,620
My daughter must say yes to the wedding.

282
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:37,860
My daughter must say yes to the wedding.

283
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,012
My daughter must say yes to the wedding.

284
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:42,760
My daughter must say yes to the wedding.

285
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,400
My daughter must say yes to the wedding.

286
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:46,540
My daughter must say yes to
the wedding. - Daddy.

287
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:47,500
My daughter must say yes to
the wedding. - Daddy.

288
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:51,340
Daddy. Daddy. I am saying yes
to the wedding. - Really!

289
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:52,820
Make the arrangements
for the wedding.

290
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,180
You mean it?
- Yes.

291
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:56,460
Yes, daddy.

292
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,300
Thank God, my prayers
are finally answered.

293
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,940
Come here, dear. Come here.
- Ok.

294
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:05,420
Ramaraju's granddaughter
and Bapiraju's daughter..

295
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:10,636
..Madhumati is being engaged
to Gavararaju's grandson..

296
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,307
..and my son Bhupatiraju.

297
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,362
So that is the matter.
What can he do then!

298
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,500
What is the matter you look very
happy? - I got the visa.

299
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,000
Canada's government was ecstatic.

300
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,920
They said that it is an honor for
them to give me the visa and..

301
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:27,280
..handed me this visa even
though I was not interested.

302
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,520
Now I am going to Canada.
- I see.

303
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,520
Which college did you get a seat in?

304
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:34,540
There is a Kupli college in
our Lane. - That is right.

305
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,980
You would get seats ln Kupli
colleges in those dingy lanes..

306
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,300
..because you lack this. Your
range is pretty low..

307
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,060
..and my range is this high.

308
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:46,960
Now I will be flying to Canada.

309
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:57,100
Oh God! How can this happen to us!
- What is that noise!

310
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,680
I do not know, sir.
- Come, Let us see.

311
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:03,240
How can this happen to us!

312
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:07,320
What happened, sister-in-law?
- How can this happen to us!

313
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:09,480
We are destroyed.
- 'To Miss. Madhumita.'

314
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:11,180
'Please forgive me.'

315
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,320
'I Love a girl. I had to
agree to this match..'

316
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,720
'..because of my father's pressure.'

317
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,434
'The girl I love attempted suicide.'

318
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:22,080
'That is why I am doing this.'

319
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,335
'If the blot on your name
that the groom left you..'

320
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,800
'..one day before the wedding can..

321
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:31,979
..save a girl's life..'
- What happened?

322
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,780
'..then I hope you agree that it is
worth it.' - What is written in it?

323
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,840
'I am sorry. Bhupatiraju.'

324
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:42,480
Siddhu, take care of your passport,
visa and air-tickets.

325
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:44,940
Ok, dad.

326
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,160
Study well. Take care.

327
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,826
O Lord!

328
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,680
Look, dad. Mother is always crying.

329
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:56,340
Mom, Look how dad is
giving me send-off.

330
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,740
Why do you always cry, mother!

331
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:03,253
Why do you always cry?
- I will also come to the airport.

332
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,760
No, mom. You cannot come
to the airport.

333
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,868
Hey, lt is just to the airport.
Take her along with you.

334
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:07,660
You want me to take mother
to the airport?

335
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,900
Mother will kill me with her
sentiments in the airport.

336
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,500
She will make me emotional
and will not let me go, daddy.

337
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,190
Please, Siddhu. Please.

338
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:19,400
Lord, have mercy on me.
Have mercy on me.

339
00:30:20,619 --> 00:30:21,962
Mother, give me your hands.

340
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,481
Give me your hands.
- No, I will not.

341
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,800
Bless me. Come on, bless me.

342
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,540
Mom.

343
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:30,346
Hey, Chandan!

344
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:53,640
'Look at the guy walking
tensed in the crowd.'

345
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,240
'Take note of him.'

346
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,940
'He is in no way related
to this story..'

347
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,400
'..but he would change
the entire story.'

348
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:05,220
'You know whose blood it is.'

349
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,130
'It is Madhumati's blood she
donated ln Kalkaluru.'

350
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,880
'It traveled all over
and eventually..'

351
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:10,160
'..reached this hospital.'

352
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,540
Hey! Hey, Bujji!

353
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:44,380
Look here. Do not worry at all.

354
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:46,500
I asked them to find another
groom for you.

355
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,720
You will get married next week.

356
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,860
Daddy, come on.
- What?

357
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:53,414
What else shall I say! You
take decisions on your own.

358
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,760
Did you ever think about me?

359
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,520
Just now a guy wrote a
Letter and ran away..

360
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,058
How can I get married immediately!

361
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:03,040
I was thinking of studying
further and you are..

362
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:08,880
You are right. You wanted
to study further..

363
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,680
..but I interfered with
it and ruined it.

364
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:12,460
Daddy, can I study further?

365
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:13,960
I want to study further,
daddy. M. Sc.

366
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,920
But I tore your college-application.

367
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:20,106
How is it possible now?
- You tore Kakatiya's application.

368
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:22,320
But I have also applied in
Nizam college in Hyderabad.

369
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,682
I got the interview card as well.

370
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:27,500
If you say ok I will join it.
- What! In Hyderabad?

371
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,120
But I did not sign it?

372
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:34,854
Yes, it is a big signature,
a long zigzag line.

373
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:38,931
I know it well. I just forged it.
- You evil girl.

374
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:02,120
Very sad. You said you would fly.

375
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,620
Is this what is called flying?

376
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,600
This leg on East Godavari,
that leg on West Godavari..

377
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,400
..and that hand is Guntur district.

378
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,360
Where will you go now, buddy?

379
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:12,955
It will take you minimum two
months for you to walk.

380
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:18,800
Dog, I am going to kill you.
I am going to kill you.

381
00:34:20,457 --> 00:34:23,857
Buddy, leave it. You are not
Dharmendra in 'Sholey'..

382
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,720
..but you are Sanjeev Kumar.
- I will see you. - Ok.

383
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:30,260
Hey, what are you fighting about?
- Look, uncle.

384
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,220
Sidhhu.
- He wants to fly in this get-up.

385
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,660
My dear!

386
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,176
Stop crying, mother. Stop crying.

387
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:40,860
Hey, do not talk like that.
She is really very upset.

388
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,863
I am lying on this bed only
because of mother, daddy.

389
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,700
Only because of mother.
When I left home..

390
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:47,440
..she was crying and my
car met an accident.

391
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:48,948
Thank God I asked her not
to come to the airport.

392
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:50,404
God forbid if she had come
there I fear what else..

393
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,976
..would have happened.
I cannot imagine them.

394
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,060
Daddy, send me to Canada somehow.

395
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:55,420
No. No. - Please, daddy. Please,
daddy. - Calm down.

396
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:58,040
In this get-up? The doctor
has already inserted..

397
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,340
..a spoon in this leg and
a plate in this leg.

398
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,940
You cannot even move for two months.
You are settled here.

399
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,700
And what about my studies?
- In your joy..

400
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:05,980
..of joining foreign
college you did not..

401
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:07,340
..apply in any local
college as a plan-B.

402
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:09,767
If you wish you can do this.

403
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:11,980
My friend is a principal in
Hyderabad's Nizam college.

404
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,551
I can ask him to hold
a seat for two months.

405
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,528
What do you say? Would you
like to study in Hyderabad?

406
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,712
How does it matter
where I study now..

407
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,040
..when I am not going to Canada.
Wherever it is!

408
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:25,120
Is it ok?

409
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:28,560
If you go to Canada you
can see Niagara falls..

410
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:30,548
..and if you go to Hyderabad
you can see Hussain Sagar.

411
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,408
You can talk to Buddha everyday.

412
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,320
Hi, I am Siddhu.
- Hi, I am Babu.

413
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,640
Hi, I am Vicky. You look
like a Bengali person.

414
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:27,740
I wil ask your name later on.
Are you new to this class?

415
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,560
Yes, and you?
- Me? I have been studying..

416
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:31,800
..ln the same class
since last 5-6 years.

417
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,216
The reason Is that I come to the
college in the beginning..

418
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:35,516
..and then I come at the end..

419
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,940
..and I spend the rest of
the time in the dance hall.

420
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,136
Dance. Dance. Dance. I
am the dance-master..

421
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:42,160
..of all these students.
- Shall we start the class?

422
00:36:42,359 --> 00:36:44,499
You will not listen to me
If I say no, right?

423
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,260
By the way, I am getting late
to smoke. Meet you later.

424
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,600
Sonam.
- Yes.

425
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:49,972
Are you ready?
- Ya. - Start.

426
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,180
Thank you.
- You are welcome.

427
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,040
I am Shanti.
- Hi, I am Madhu. - Hi.

428
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,940
This temple is so serene.

429
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,984
Cold breeze, nice weather..

430
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:54,400
I did not believe it when others
said it, but I really liked it.

431
00:37:57,460 --> 00:38:01,020
I like it.
- You know Nisha, whenever I come..

432
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,184
..to the temple it reminds
me of my daddy.

433
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:09,160
So you too have a girlfriend.
That is how it should be.

434
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,500
Hello.
- Hello.

435
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,312
Have we met before?

436
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,232
Sorry, I did not mean it that way.

437
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,920
This is every guy's favorite
Pick-up Line..

438
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,280
..but I did not mean it that way.

439
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,512
I really feel like I met you before.

440
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,640
I too feel the same way.
- Did you see that!

441
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,648
We are meeting for the first
time, but there ls...

442
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:08,120
..this feeling that we know
each other since 20 years.

443
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:13,120
Me too. - Anyhow, I am
Sidhu Siddhartha Roy.

444
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:17,640
Madhu. Madhumati.
- Madhu. Madhumati. Beautiful name.

445
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:19,923
You are..
- Madhu.

446
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:24,860
Friends.
- Friends.

447
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:26,340
Cool.
- Bye. - Bye.

448
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:38,820
Oh! Your sword is scaring me.

449
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,260
You are moving that sword
Like Abhimanyu did..

450
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:42,820
..ln the battle of Mahabharata.

451
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,728
You think it is a sword
or some stick?

452
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:51,500
Sidhu, do you love any girl?
- No, not till now.

453
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:53,772
Never came across anyone like that.

454
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:56,760
It seems that you love someone.
- Yes.

455
00:40:58,620 --> 00:40:59,980
Who is she?
- She is studying in our college.

456
00:41:00,939 --> 00:41:03,020
Our group?
- No, maths.

457
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:03,680
What is her name?

458
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:06,100
Shanti.

459
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:09,948
What is the hurdle in your love?

460
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,660
The hurdle is that I am an orphan.

461
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:15,292
Shanti's father is Gudumba Satti.

462
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:17,468
Everyone in this town
is scared of him.

463
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:19,960
And right now it is college holidays.

464
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,240
It is pretty tough for
Me not to see her.

465
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:24,380
They are disconnecting the phone.

466
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,160
They are not letting her
Step out of the house.

467
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:28,172
That is why I wrote this Letter.

468
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:29,293
Come here.

469
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:32,400
Address.

470
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,576
Take out boys there and solve lt.

471
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,720
Give me a call if there
Is any problem. Got it?

472
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:05,462
Babu is in real trouble.

473
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:11,060
Hello, uncle!
- Hello, dear! How are you?

474
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:14,580
I am fine. How are you?
- I am perfectly fine.

475
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,660
Madhu.
- And what is Shanti saying?

476
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:20,100
She is your daughter after
All. Bye. Bye, uncle.

477
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,340
Goodbye. Come, dear.

478
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,320
Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello!

479
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:35,460
Sidhu Siddhartha Roy. Temple.
- Hl. - Hl.

480
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,304
How come you are..
- How come you are..

481
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,592
What is there in your hand?
- Letter.

482
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,536
Love Letter?
- How did you guess that?

483
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,180
That is written on your face.
Do not you have any sense?

484
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:49,820
Do not you have any manners?

485
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:51,320
Do not you know how to
behave in public?

486
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:53,928
You wore a pant. You wore
a shirt. You wore shoes.

487
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,416
Hello!
- You are educated. - Hello!

488
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,380
Hello! Hello!
- Is this what you learnt all now?

489
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,600
Go and do something worthwhile.

490
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:01,532
Hello! Will you stop it?

491
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,135
Why are you shooting your mouth?

492
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:07,860
Yes. It is my mouth. It is my
wish. I can say anything.

493
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:08,980
But it is my ears that
are hearing them.

494
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:12,300
Your words are hurting my heart.
- What a great heart!

495
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:14,140
Yours is a cheap heart that
wrote a Love Letter..

496
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,160
..to a girl whom you saw just
a couple of days ago.

497
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,496
Hello! Madhu! I did not write
this letter for you.

498
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:22,380
But my friend wrote this
letter to your friend.

499
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:25,280
Semester holidays. He
was unable to meet her.

500
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:26,477
They were disconnecting the phone.

501
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:28,876
My friend asked me if I
could help him. - Sorry.

502
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,780
I said of course I would help
my friend. - Sorry. Sorry.

503
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:32,700
But when I came here there
Was a watchman.. - Sorry.

504
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:34,600
So I thought of somehow
Bribing the watchman..

505
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:35,352
..and smuggling this letter inside.
- Sorry. Sorry.

506
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:37,357
But then I saw you, I thought
I know this girl.. - Sorry.

507
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,240
..so I can take her help,
my job will get easier.

508
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:41,308
But here when I brought this
letter to you.. - I am sorry.

509
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:42,639
..you have started abusing me
as lf I am some sort of..

510
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:44,580
What did you say? Do I Look
Like a stupid? - Sorry.

511
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,680
Do I look like an eve-teaser?
- No.

512
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,380
How do I look like?
- I am sorry.

513
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:50,140
Do I look like a roadside Romeo?
- No, you do not.

514
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:51,460
Do not say sorry. Do not
keep telling me.

515
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:54,248
You really did hurt me.
- I am sorry. Please.

516
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:59,980
I am sorry. I am so sorry.

517
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,900
He always cracks such sort of
jokes and keeps us in splits.

518
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:05,317
When he comes to the class..

519
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:10,540
''What is this torture?''

520
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:14,000
''Babu, how long will you..''

521
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:19,240
Madhu, we live in adjoining flats..

522
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:20,580
..We study in the same college..

523
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:21,960
..But how come we still
do not know each other.

524
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:24,860
Keep that aside, today we are
talking here at this place..

525
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:27,940
..alone for no reason.
What do you call this?

526
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:31,028
Love.
- Love?

527
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:33,123
Babu and Shanti's love.

528
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:36,512
What did you think?

529
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:40,320
Nothing.
- Madhu, did you love anyone?

530
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:42,100
And you?

531
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:43,520
Why?

532
00:44:45,079 --> 00:44:45,819
Just like that.

533
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:50,628
And why did not you love anyone?
- I do not know.

534
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:52,980
You do not know how to love?
- No. No. No.

535
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:56,132
So you know that?
- Oh Sidhu! Please.

536
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:58,060
Let us talk about something else
please. - What shall I do!

537
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:14,700
Bye.
- Bye.

538
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:17,060
Bye.
- Bye. - Bye, goodnight.

539
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:18,020
Bye.

540
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:26,980
Goodnight, Babu.
- Meet you in the college tomorrow.

541
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:28,400
Ok, bye.
- Bye.

542
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:41,660
So..
- So..

543
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:43,700
So, thanks.

544
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:47,400
You must thank strangers when
they give you a lift.

545
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:50,986
Do we really need these formalities?

546
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:54,460
What shall we do now?
- Take back your thanks.

547
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:55,988
Then give me back.

548
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:04,315
Bye.
- Bye.

549
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:09,580
Dear students, our college cultural
programs are nearing.

550
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:11,936
Tomorrow the dance
rehearsals will begin.

551
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:59,150
Come on, move! - O God!
I cannot make it right.

552
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:35,500
Stop it!

553
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:40,440
Hi!
- Hi!

554
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:44,208
Can you give this letter to Shanti?
- Ok. - Ok, bye.

555
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:47,060
Oh! You did not glue this?

556
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:50,500
It is that? I feared that
it is something else.

557
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:52,940
Very good. I appreciate
your friendship.

558
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:54,559
That is how friends should be.

559
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:56,100
Your friend gave you this
personal letter..

560
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:59,360
..without pasting it, that shows
how much he trusts you.

561
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:01,340
No, there is nothing like that.
You can also read it.

562
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:04,260
No. No. No.
- It is a Love-Letter. Very personal.

563
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:06,900
Your friend gave you with
Trust and you gave me this.

564
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:10,300
And my friend trusts me. We
Cannot betray that trust, ok?

565
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:14,040
What trust! Dear Shanti,
I cannot come to college..

566
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,920
..for a couple of days. I
Cannot take you to a movie..

567
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:18,640
..this Friday evening.
So please do not mind.

568
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:20,900
I am going to Vizag
on orphanage work.

569
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,740
I do not know how to live
without you for two days.

570
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:25,620
I do not know how to live without
Kissing you for 2 days.

571
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,740
That is why my heart is going
again and again with..

572
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:29,460
Shanti, I Love you. Shanti,
I Love you.

573
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:30,620
I Love you. Love you.
Love you. Love you.

574
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:31,596
Enough.
- I Love you. Love you. Love you.

575
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:34,240
What a character you are!
- Me?

576
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:35,904
How can you open a Letter
and read it just like that!

577
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:37,986
You think it is just
Any other letter?

578
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:39,420
Love letter. Full of personal
emotions you know.

579
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:41,500
You are betraying your
friend’s trust.

580
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:43,460
It is wrong. You are a crook.

581
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:45,360
You are a jerk. You are a cheat.

582
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:46,840
You are a pervert.
- Yes.

583
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:48,672
You are a stupid. You are an idiot.
- Yes. Yes.

584
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:50,480
Your mind is full of filthy.
You are a traitor.

585
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:53,120
Madhu, chill. Chill.
- I know you are a cheat.

586
00:48:53,439 --> 00:48:54,919
You are a..
- Cool.

587
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:57,500
Cool.

588
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:00,636
Do I look that cheap?

589
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:05,100
Babu's thumb.. This finger..
Not this, but his thumb..

590
00:49:06,059 --> 00:49:08,199
..tore off and bled profusely.

591
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:11,340
Could he have written in that
condition? No, he couldn’t.

592
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:12,980
That is why he dictated it
and I wrote his letter.

593
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,200
You got it? Or do you want
any other explanations?

594
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:19,360
I am sorry. - Am I clear or do
I have to say something else?

595
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:23,871
Sidhu. Sidhu. - Just this
much gap is enough for you..

596
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:26,520
You just go on and on and on.
- I said I am sorry.

597
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:29,496
Now start your usual apologies.
- I am sorry.

598
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:32,520
No, I know. I know. I know.
I know about you.

599
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:33,752
I know you are going to
end up with this.

600
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:35,660
Please.
- You do one thing.

601
00:49:36,031 --> 00:49:39,135
Record a cassette with 'I
am sorry' thousand times..

602
00:49:39,423 --> 00:49:42,243
..and keep it with you, because
you need it again and again.

603
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:45,180
I am sorry. I am sorry.

604
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:49,220
I am sorry.
- Ok.

605
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:00,400
Oh no! What happened?
- It seems that car broke down.

606
00:50:00,783 --> 00:50:02,163
What shall we do now?
- Let us lock and walk.

607
00:50:05,774 --> 00:50:06,542
There will not be any problem, right?

608
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:08,332
There will be no problem. We will
call the mechanic at morning..

609
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:10,180
..and he will take care of it.
We can go by walk now. - Ok.

610
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:15,880
Madhu, can I ask you something?
- What?

611
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:21,200
Who do you like most?
- Like most? I like my father most.

612
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:23,418
Of course, I too like
my father very much.

613
00:50:23,662 --> 00:50:25,870
Since childhood he taught
me morals and all that..

614
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,180
I like my dad. Who else?

615
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:32,783
I like my mother.
- Of course, I too like my mother.

616
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:35,156
She sang lullabies for me,
fed me from her hands..

617
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:38,540
I love my mother. Who else
do you like very much?

618
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:41,916
Then.. I like Chiranjeevi.

619
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:48,480
Chiranjeevi?
- Chiranjeevi. Film actor.

620
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,420
I see. Film actor Chiranjeevi?

621
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:52,300
He fights well, dances well..

622
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:54,280
Blood donations. Blood banks.
Social service.

623
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:58,421
I like him. He is a good fellow.
I too like him very much.

624
00:50:59,060 --> 00:50:59,880
That is not what I mean, Madhu.

625
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:02,800
Chiranjeevi, mother, father..
Everyone likes them.

626
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:07,720
On a personal level who is
the person you like most?

627
00:51:08,895 --> 00:51:11,406
Oh God!
- Madhu. Madhu. Madhu.

628
00:51:11,727 --> 00:51:13,807
Oh God!
- Madhu. - Oh God! Oh God!

629
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:17,364
Look, you want to hear some
specific person's name.

630
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:20,159
Tell me his name. I will
tell you that I like him.

631
00:51:21,758 --> 00:51:25,091
Forget it. Take it light.
- Oh God!

632
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:26,875
Goodnight.

633
00:52:57,640 --> 00:52:59,820
''Love is not easy.''

634
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:02,252
''You cannot conquer it.''

635
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:05,080
''What are the conditions in love?''

636
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:07,705
''What is the mystery in love?''

637
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:10,300
''Love is precious.''

638
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:12,880
''Everyone does not get it.''

639
00:53:13,540 --> 00:53:15,620
''It looks beautiful.''

640
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:18,528
''But it bursts when you touch lt.''

641
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:23,654
''No. No. Do not say that.''

642
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:26,240
''Where there is a will
there is a way.''

643
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:28,980
''I will do it for you.''

644
00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:32,252
''I will show it to the world.''

645
00:53:42,743 --> 00:53:44,803
''Love is not easy.''

646
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:47,592
''You cannot conquer it.''

647
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:50,180
''What are the conditions in love?''

648
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:52,880
''What is the mystery in love?''

649
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:55,420
''Love is precious.''

650
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:58,160
''Everyone does not get it.''

651
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:00,552
''It looks beautiful.''

652
00:54:01,255 --> 00:54:03,543
''But it bursts when you touch lt.''

653
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,520
''No. No. Do not say that.''

655
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:14,000
''I will do it for you.''

656
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:16,536
''I will show it to the world.''

657
00:55:08,870 --> 00:55:10,956

''I will show it to the world.''

669
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:00,700
Hi. - Hi, Babu. Babu,
did you see Siddhu?

670
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:03,060
Is it your birthday?
- No.

671
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:04,500
Anything special?
- Why?

672
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:07,680
New dress. Happy mood.
Anything special?

673
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:08,860
Nothing special.

674
00:56:09,980 --> 00:56:12,332
And where is Siddhu? - He is there
on the left side corner.

675
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:14,516
But just now I came from that way.

676
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:16,900
You might have come from
that way, but there is a..

677
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:18,276
..telephone booth over there
that you must have overlooked.

678
00:56:18,379 --> 00:56:19,980
He is inside the telephone
booth? Bye. - Bye.

679
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:21,580
No. No. No. No. No, sweetheart.

680
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:23,680
It is true that there was one
week holidays last month.

681
00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:26,580
But I had to stay here as
my friends forced me.

682
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:28,260
That is why I could not come,
sweetheart. Sorry.

683
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:31,780
Hello! Hello!

684
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:35,629
Hello, Gita! Will you
Listen to what I say?

685
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:38,220
There is another week
holidays next month.

686
00:56:38,540 --> 00:56:39,700
I will definitely come this time.

687
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:41,820
Are you happy now?

688
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:45,820
I Love you, Geeta. I Love you.
I Love you so much.

689
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:47,800
You want me to give me something..

690
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:49,020
..that you would remember
till I come there.

691
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:54,260
Bye.

692
00:56:58,300 --> 00:56:59,880
Hi! Were you waiting for me?

693
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:01,900
What is the matter you
Look so ugly today?

694
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:04,020
Yes, you would find me ugly now.

695
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:07,720
Hey, the truth is you look very
beautiful. I just gave it a twist.

696
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:09,460
Yes, you enjoy twisting things.

697
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:12,520
Hey, lt was just a joke. Why
are you getting serious?

698
00:57:13,820 --> 00:57:16,540
Siddhu, Madhu is waiting for you.

699
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:19,540
I see. So you had already met.

700
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:25,300
Madhu, you were waiting for me?
- I came to talk to you..

701
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:26,820
..about something important,
but I forgot it.

702
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:30,340
She forgot it.
- Siddhu!

703
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:34,206
Who?
- Who?

704
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:36,720
Who was on the phone?
- Gita.

705
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:39,760
Who is she?
- My mom.

706
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:43,080
Mom?
- Yes, my mom.

707
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:46,940
But you called her Gita.
- Yes, that's what her name is.

708
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:48,560
I call my mom Gita
and father Arvind.

709
00:57:48,620 --> 00:57:49,580
I used call them that
way since childhood..

710
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:53,240
..and now I am habituated to it.

711
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:56,740
I talk to her everyday after
the conference. That is it.

712
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:02,120
Mom?
- Mom.

713
00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:06,028
Mom?
- Mom.

714
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:25,360
Hi, dear! Will you come with me?
- Stupid.

715
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:27,640
Buddy, she got upset.

716
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:31,740
Hey, you! Bring down the volume.

717
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:34,664
There was some problem
yesterday, right?

718
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:35,600
Yesterday's problem?

719
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:39,600
Yesterday we bumped into
four guys from Afsalgunj.

720
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:41,340
Sheru, Ajay and I, the three of us..

721
00:58:41,540 --> 00:58:43,400
..bashed them so hard, so hard..

722
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:46,480
..that they were left
unrecognizable. - Really!

723
00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:48,320
They were lucky that I was there.

724
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:51,000
Brother Sheru took out a knife.
- Knife?

725
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:53,180
The scene would have gotten worse.

726
00:58:54,220 --> 00:58:56,317
Sheru, tell them what you did.
- Hey, stop it!

727
00:58:57,180 --> 00:59:01,520
Take it light. - it seems that
brother's still very upset.

728
00:59:06,980 --> 00:59:10,100
Look there, Sheru. Your
anger will come down.

729
00:59:11,060 --> 00:59:12,780
She is sexy, buddy.

730
00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:17,700
You are right, buddy.

731
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:20,420
I will take her today.

732
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:26,200
Hey, will you come to Khandala?

733
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:31,000
Forget Khandala, we would
take her to Gandipet?

734
00:59:34,420 --> 00:59:35,520
What do you say, Ajay?

735
00:59:37,460 --> 00:59:38,060
Let her go.

736
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:44,020
Siddhu.
- Hi, Madhu. - Hi.

737
00:59:45,060 --> 00:59:46,140
The entire shop is ours.

738
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:47,360
We will go?

739
00:59:49,380 --> 00:59:52,600
Sheru, no matter whatever you
say today this girl must be..

740
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:55,860
We will get nothing if we
keep on thinking, Sheru.

741
00:59:56,420 --> 00:59:57,860
Look there, that guy is
taking away that girl.

742
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:03,520
Kamal, start the van.

743
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:12,340
What the hell are you doing!

744
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:17,860
The girl's pretty fast, buddy.

745
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:20,700
What!
- You filthy jerks.

746
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:22,760
What did you say! What did you say!

747
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:25,800
Cannot you see while driving?
- What shall I see?

748
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:27,160
Show me.
- Show you?

749
01:00:27,660 --> 01:00:29,020
Sorry, brother. I do not know
what happened before this..

750
01:00:29,020 --> 01:00:30,120
..but I am sorry. - Why are you
saying sorry? - I am really sorry.

751
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:31,720
Who are you to interfere in this!
Get out of this. Get out.

752
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:32,240
Madhu, you do not know these guys.

753
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:33,260
These guys are too dangerous.

754
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:34,980
Take him away from here or
else I am going to kill him.

755
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:36,020
I will take care of him.
- Take him away.

756
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:38,000
Brother, tell your friend.
Tell your friend.

757
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:40,960
Hey, she is our heartbeat.
- You will get bashed up here.

758
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:42,327
Why are you saying sorry!

759
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:43,920
Do not touch her.

760
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:47,552
Please listen to me I am a
believer of non-violence.

761
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:48,740
Tell him to go away.
- Let us not get into fights.

762
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:50,440
Brother follows non-violence.

763
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:52,440
He is the Gandhi of this millennium.

764
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:56,680
Look, if you brought it this far,
do not provoke me further.

765
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:57,920
Really? You will beat me?

766
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,260
Ok, come on, Let us fight.
Come on, Let us fight.

767
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:02,400
If you brought it this far I would
keep non-violence aside.

768
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:04,028
Now there will be violence.

769
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:06,943
You..

770
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:12,720

01:08:24,380 --> 01:08:28,160
''If I am a book
your face is a picture in it.''

851
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:32,679
''If I am a word you are its meaning.''

852
01:08:33,580 --> 01:08:37,340
''Your flying scarf creates a sensation.''

853
01:08:38,020 --> 01:08:41,780
''Your admirers go crazy about you.''

854
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:46,367
''Your arm around me
ls the ultimate comfort for me.''

855
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:50,920
''You are sunshine for me on a cloudy day.''

856
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:54,916
''Where there is love..''

857
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:59,880
''Where there is love
there is happiness all around.''

858
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:04,940
''When a girl gives that half-smile..''

859
01:09:05,420 --> 01:09:09,080
''..boys go crazy and become bed-ridden.''

860
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:14,120
''When a boy looks straight into the eyes..''

861
01:09:14,540 --> 01:09:18,100
''..it even melt glaclers.''

862
01:09:18,860 --> 01:09:22,100
''Those smiles, these looks..''

863
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:27,698
''Those smiles and these looks
when united form love.''

864
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:37,420
Hi, Madhu.

865
01:09:38,540 --> 01:09:39,260
Did you get scared?

866
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:44,736
What is this?
- A small gift.

867
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:45,340
For me?

868
01:09:46,721 --> 01:09:47,421
It must be interesting.

869
01:09:54,780 --> 01:09:56,280
You can open it slowly.
What is the rush!

870
01:09:56,280 --> 01:09:57,140
I know. I know.

871
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:01,940
Astray?

872
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:06,340
Beautiful. Where did you buy it?
- In Taj Art Gallery.

873
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:07,920
How much did it cost?
- 10,000.

874
01:10:10,220 --> 01:10:10,960
10,000?

875
01:10:13,540 --> 01:10:16,837
It is 10,000? - Ya. It is.
- 10,000 for an ashtray?

876
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:19,767
Because it is made of china crystal.

877
01:10:20,153 --> 01:10:23,033
Because of its minute art-works
it costs so much.

878
01:10:23,340 --> 01:10:25,948
What is this Madhu! It Looks good,
but still you could have..

879
01:10:26,393 --> 01:10:27,553
..bought me something
else instead of this.

880
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:33,959
I cannot flick ash in such a costly
ashtray, Madhu. I cannot.

881
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:35,400
That is why I bought it.

882
01:10:35,713 --> 01:10:36,933
That is the reason I
bought that ashtray.

883
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:40,040
Every time you smoke
and flick ash in it..

884
01:10:40,820 --> 01:10:44,340
..you should remember me.
You should feel like..

885
01:10:44,416 --> 01:10:48,993
..flicking ash on me. So
you should stop smoking.

886
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:51,860
Sorry. You want me to stop smoking?

887
01:10:52,860 --> 01:10:55,080
I smoke to maintain some style..

888
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:57,140
..and you want me to stop it?
Sorry, I cannot do it.

889
01:10:58,140 --> 01:10:59,440
If you really..

890
01:11:01,180 --> 01:11:06,400
..respect me, you would
never smoke again, ok?

891
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:14,560
Beautiful.

892
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:17,100
Ok.

893
01:11:19,824 --> 01:11:20,764
Last puff, ok?

894
01:11:24,220 --> 01:11:24,720
Just one more.

895
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:31,624
Just one more.

896
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:35,520
Let me just finish this.

897
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:42,900
Happy?

898
01:11:43,825 --> 01:11:44,485
That is good.

899
01:11:51,860 --> 01:11:52,480
That is good.

900
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:29,820
Hi, Madhu. - Do not disturb.
Exams. I am studying.

901
01:15:06,060 --> 01:15:07,680
Siddhu.
- Do not disturb.

902
01:15:07,820 --> 01:15:10,960
Siddhu. This is not right.
- What?

903
01:15:11,380 --> 01:15:12,100
What you are doing.

904
01:15:15,220 --> 01:15:16,060
Studying a book is not wrong, is it?

905
01:15:16,280 --> 01:15:17,196
I am not studying wrong questions.

906
01:15:17,420 --> 01:15:18,940
I am not talking about
what you are reading.

907
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:20,240
I am talking about what
you are looking at.

908
01:15:23,240 --> 01:15:26,182
I am looking at the book.
- Do not lie to me. You..

909
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:30,400
You looked at waist.
- What!

910
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:33,340
Do not act. You looked at it.
- No.

911
01:15:33,720 --> 01:15:34,904
You looked at it.
- I said I did not.

912
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:37,980
I said you looked at it. I saw
you looking at my waist.

913
01:15:43,300 --> 01:15:45,604
May be accidentally
while turning pages..

914
01:15:46,060 --> 01:15:48,160
..I might have seen
it accidentally..

915
01:15:48,700 --> 01:15:49,680
..but I did not look
at it in that way.

916
01:15:50,260 --> 01:15:51,520
It is not been one minute
since you came here..

917
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:52,520
..you have not read even
a single page..

918
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:53,760
..but you looked at me
at least ten times.

919
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:55,660
Madhu, you are looking at
me from a wrong angle.

920
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,180
Who? Me? I am looking at
you in the wrong angle..

921
01:15:58,200 --> 01:15:59,140
..or you were Looking
at me in a wrong angle?

922
01:15:59,240 --> 01:16:00,080
Madhu, you have mistaken me.

923
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:01,720
Not just now, but you have
been making a mistake..

924
01:16:01,740 --> 01:16:02,680
..ever since the beginning.
That day in the dance hall..

925
01:16:02,860 --> 01:16:05,780
..when I gave you that open
Letter what did you say..

926
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:08,700
You said I am a bad fellow.
I read others' letters.

927
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:10,607
You said I am a crook, that
I am a pervert, did not you?

928
01:16:11,780 --> 01:16:13,480
And then when I said that I
wrote that letter as he had..

929
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:15,220
..an injured thumb you apologized
to me, did not you?

930
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:18,020
Ok, leave that aside. Take our
first meeting for example.

931
01:16:18,220 --> 01:16:19,228
You saw Babu's letter
to Shanti in my hand..

932
01:16:19,260 --> 01:16:20,360
..and assumed that I was about
to give you that letter..

933
01:16:20,420 --> 01:16:22,380
..you started jumping up and down?

934
01:16:27,560 --> 01:16:30,060
Did not you jump? Now that
says your psychology..

935
01:16:30,100 --> 01:16:31,540
You feel that you are the most
beautiful girl on earth..

936
01:16:31,740 --> 01:16:33,020
..and that everyone should be
mesmerized by your beauty..

937
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:34,880
..and admire you badly.

938
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:39,600
But if anyone hits upon you,
you start screaming..

939
01:16:40,280 --> 01:16:41,520
That is how girls' psychology is.

940
01:16:42,170 --> 01:16:43,910
When you are talking about
me talk only about me.

941
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:45,560
Do not generalize it.

942
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:47,740
What do you know about
girls' psychology?

943
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:51,380
It is not us who keep something in
mind and talk something else.

944
01:16:52,020 --> 01:16:54,120
At least I do not do that.
Men do that.

945
01:16:55,060 --> 01:16:56,300
Ok, you do that.

946
01:16:57,740 --> 01:16:59,860
That day when we were eating
fried rice what did you do?

947
01:17:00,060 --> 01:17:01,456
You dropped your spoon
intentionally.

948
01:17:01,540 --> 01:17:03,320
And then you took my spoon,
the spoon I was eating with..

949
01:17:03,340 --> 01:17:05,380
..and started eating
with it, did not you?

950
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:08,680
Did not you hide it then?
What did you hide then?

951
01:17:10,140 --> 01:17:12,340
And the other day you said
that the car broke down..

952
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:14,392
..when it did not, you said
we would lock it and walk.

953
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:15,604
What did you ask me
when we were walking?

954
01:17:16,300 --> 01:17:18,180
Who do you like most?
Who do you like most?

955
01:17:18,280 --> 01:17:19,442
Did not you bombard me
with that question?

956
01:17:20,240 --> 01:17:22,080
Ok, leave that aside, a few
days ago when your father..

957
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:23,240
..came here, and when you were
introducing us to him..

958
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:25,640
He is Sunder, studying maths,
my college-mate, my friend.

959
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:27,840
He is Babu, studying physics,
my class-mate, my friend.

960
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,840
She is Madhu, studying maths,
my college-mate, my friend.

961
01:17:29,980 --> 01:17:31,040
You could have said it just like that.

962
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:33,636
Why did you falter then? What
were you hiding then?

963
01:17:34,540 --> 01:17:36,205
All these days you have been
hanging out with me..

964
01:17:36,240 --> 01:17:38,400
..even after knowing all that, what
should I call that? Tell me.

965
01:17:39,620 --> 01:17:41,340
Even after knowing all that
you presented me an ashtray.

966
01:17:41,991 --> 01:17:44,071
Ok. Ok. We can call it friendship.

967
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:45,752
That day when I was talking
ln the college-phone..

968
01:17:45,980 --> 01:17:47,052
..when I said 'Gita, I love
you' and kissed her..

969
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:49,020
..you were dying to know
who that Gita was.

970
01:17:49,340 --> 01:17:50,940
Who? Gita? Who is she?
She is my mother.

971
01:17:51,223 --> 01:17:52,343
Only after telling that you
cooled down, did not you?

972
01:17:53,980 --> 01:17:56,012
Ok, presenting an ashtray
to an acquaint of yours..

973
01:17:56,100 --> 01:17:57,540
..to get him rid of smoking
can be called friendship.

974
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,220
But the pain and the possessiveness
you felt..

975
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:01,488
..to know who that Gita was..
What do you call it?

976
01:18:05,500 --> 01:18:08,028
Do not change the topic. Did
you look at my waist or not?

977
01:18:08,300 --> 01:18:09,900
Did you love me or not?
- No.

978
01:18:10,345 --> 01:18:11,113
I too did not look at your waist.

979
01:18:20,920 --> 01:18:22,380
It is not been even five minutes
since we sat on the terrace..

980
01:18:22,380 --> 01:18:24,120
..and now I have to deal with
an egoistic character..

981
01:18:24,220 --> 01:18:25,350
..who finds hundred
faults in others..

982
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:26,880
I would never have such
a girl as my friend.

983
01:18:27,420 --> 01:18:28,782
Even if she is my friend that
friendship will not turn into love.

984
01:18:29,100 --> 01:18:30,500
Even if it turns into love it
will not go as far as marriage.

985
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:32,697
And if I am forced to
marry that girl..

986
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:34,000
..I would write a letter that
I will not want such a girl..

987
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:36,580
..and run away the night
before the wedding.

988
01:18:44,820 --> 01:18:46,960
You..
- Madhu.

989
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:48,911
Look..

990
01:18:51,240 --> 01:18:52,120
..you do not have..

991
01:18:54,540 --> 01:19:00,000
..any rights to talk about
me or my character.

992
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:07,600
I will assume that I had not met
anyone called Siddhu in my life.

993
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:16,791
From now onwards there is
nothing between you and me.

994
01:19:22,367 --> 01:19:28,567
There is nothing between you and me.

995
01:19:29,700 --> 01:19:31,900
Madhu.. Madhu, I did not mean to..

996
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:23,340
Priya.
- Yes, sir.

997
01:20:23,720 --> 01:20:24,740
Ravi.
- Yes, sir.

998
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:26,114
Sukanya.
- Yes, sir.

999
01:20:26,700 --> 01:20:28,020
Rosy.
- Yes, sir.

1000
01:20:28,044 --> 01:20:29,100
Jhansi. - Yes, sir.

1001
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:30,220
Siddhu.

1002
01:20:30,980 --> 01:20:32,980
Babu. Babu.

1003
01:20:34,180 --> 01:20:35,480
Siddhu, Babu had not come?

1004
01:20:37,340 --> 01:20:38,500
Madhu.
- Yes, ma'am.

1005
01:20:39,254 --> 01:20:42,980
Shanti. Shanti. Shanti.

1006
01:20:43,620 --> 01:20:46,640
Madhu, Shanti had not come.
- I do not know, ma'am.

1007
01:20:49,240 --> 01:20:51,000
I will kill you.
- Just kill me at once.

1008
01:20:51,148 --> 01:20:54,400
I will not kill you. I will kill you.
- If anything happens to Babu..

1009
01:20:54,440 --> 01:20:57,180
..you will not find me alive.
- You will die? Ok, die.

1010
01:20:58,200 --> 01:21:00,500
Run away with him and dying
is one and the same for me.

1011
01:21:00,900 --> 01:21:02,520
It would be better if you die.

1012
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:08,864
You were born as my daughter
but you do not want money?

1013
01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:11,840
It makes me doubt your
mother's character.

1014
01:21:14,300 --> 01:21:19,280
If you meet him or he meets
you he will not stay alive.

1015
01:21:22,160 --> 01:21:25,340
From that day onwards I have
been house-arrested..

1016
01:21:26,460 --> 01:21:28,760
..by my father. I do not know
what happened to Babu.

1017
01:21:29,240 --> 01:21:33,300
Shanti. Shanti. Shanti, please.

1018
01:21:34,100 --> 01:21:35,080
Nothing will happen to Babu.

1019
01:21:36,303 --> 01:21:40,900
It is my responsibility to unite
you with him. It is a promise.

1020
01:22:05,800 --> 01:22:06,300
Siddhu.

1021
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:11,720
If you think that I came here
to make a compromise..

1022
01:22:11,740 --> 01:22:14,540
..it would be wrong.
- Who said compromising is wrong!

1023
01:22:15,080 --> 01:22:16,840
Look here. I did not come here..

1024
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:22,360
Sorry, I did not come here
to argue with you.

1025
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:24,864
I came here to talk about
something important.

1026
01:22:26,220 --> 01:22:28,040
In the last two months in
our summer holidays..

1027
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:29,220
..many things took place here.

1028
01:22:30,520 --> 01:22:31,980
Babu went to Shanti's
house to see her..

1029
01:22:32,700 --> 01:22:34,280
..and mistook her father
as Shanti and woke him up..

1030
01:22:34,340 --> 01:22:34,996
..and got caught there.

1031
01:22:35,960 --> 01:22:37,480
Shanti's father kept her
under house-arrest.

1032
01:22:38,300 --> 01:22:40,180
Did Babu come to class?
- No, he did not.

1033
01:22:40,959 --> 01:22:43,060
The love we started
is in a problem now.

1034
01:22:45,480 --> 01:22:48,340
I mean Babu and Shanti's love.

1035
01:22:49,420 --> 01:22:52,520
Did you see Shanti?
Sorry, did you see her?

1036
01:22:57,360 --> 01:22:58,384
I am coming from there now.

1037
01:22:59,020 --> 01:23:00,125
Shanti had not stopped weeping.

1038
01:23:01,020 --> 01:23:02,580
I promised her that I am there
for her and that I take..

1039
01:23:02,780 --> 01:23:05,720
..the responsibility to
reunite her with Babu.

1040
01:23:06,260 --> 01:23:08,100
And I came here to meet you
regarding that matter.

1041
01:23:09,500 --> 01:23:10,940
You too made a promise
to your friend.

1042
01:23:12,060 --> 01:23:15,160
So I for the promise that
I made to my friend..

1043
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:17,800
..and you for the promise
you made to your friend..

1044
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:20,500
..together we have to..

1045
01:23:24,380 --> 01:23:28,160
Together?
- Together..

1046
01:23:31,700 --> 01:23:32,852
..together we have to unite them.

1047
01:23:36,820 --> 01:23:40,660
I used the term 'together'.
First I have to define it well.

1048
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:44,440
In the coming days when
we would move together..

1049
01:23:45,080 --> 01:23:47,016
..we will have to decide now
what sort of a relationship..

1050
01:23:47,640 --> 01:23:48,840
..there would be between us.

1051
01:23:52,620 --> 01:23:55,200
It is not friendship. It is not love.

1052
01:23:56,220 --> 01:23:57,516
It is no other relation.

1053
01:24:00,280 --> 01:24:04,776
Just a blind relation.
A blind relationship.

1054
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:08,220
A relationship which has no meaning.

1055
01:24:10,940 --> 01:24:13,600
And that relation will also
end once we unite them.

1056
01:24:18,020 --> 01:24:19,880
I hope you would not cross
the line I drew.

1057
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:21,960
I hope I do not have to remind
you again about it.

1058
01:24:23,540 --> 01:24:26,220
You said exactly what
I wanted to say.

1059
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:31,060
We will go and see Babu now.
- Ya. Why not?

1060
01:24:34,420 --> 01:24:34,964
Let us go.

1061
01:24:52,240 --> 01:24:53,440
Babu, what is this beard!

1062
01:25:00,060 --> 01:25:01,640
Two months! What!

1063
01:25:02,700 --> 01:25:04,013
You could not control yourself
for two months?

1064
01:25:04,280 --> 01:25:06,380
What was the rush! Ok, you
went to Shanti's house.

1065
01:25:06,780 --> 01:25:08,360
And then instead of
waking up Shanti..

1066
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:10,060
..you woke up her father?

1067
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:15,100
Hey, now stop it!

1068
01:25:16,640 --> 01:25:18,400
That is the reason.. That is
the reason I say..

1069
01:25:18,620 --> 01:25:21,440
..there would be no commitments
regarding Love and crap.

1070
01:25:21,940 --> 01:25:25,360
Now Look at me how happy I am,
how cheerful I look..

1071
01:25:25,880 --> 01:25:27,544
..because I never loved anyone..

1072
01:25:27,980 --> 01:25:30,180
..and did not get stuck in
any problem alike you.

1073
01:25:30,420 --> 01:25:32,380
You thought I would get stuck
in it and suffer like you?

1074
01:25:33,780 --> 01:25:34,280
Siddhu.

1075
01:25:37,060 --> 01:25:39,572
It Looks stupid to put
a smile on the face..

1076
01:25:39,740 --> 01:25:41,340
..when there is so much pain
in the heart. - What!

1077
01:25:42,980 --> 01:25:47,440
I mean the pain that you have
inside your heart for Babu.

1078
01:25:48,040 --> 01:25:50,340
Is that so! If we put a dull face
all problems will be solved?

1079
01:25:50,580 --> 01:25:51,860
To solve X number of problems
if we have to..

1080
01:25:52,180 --> 01:25:53,128
..make a dull face for
Y number of hours..

1081
01:25:53,140 --> 01:25:54,413
..then I will do exactly that.
When your dull face..

1082
01:25:54,440 --> 01:25:55,450
..cannot solve any problem
what is the use then?

1083
01:25:56,019 --> 01:25:56,885
What is the use then?

1084
01:25:57,860 --> 01:25:59,500
Babu, do not worry about anything.

1085
01:25:59,620 --> 01:26:00,680
Concentrate on your studies.
We can afford to..

1086
01:26:00,900 --> 01:26:02,180
..neglect studies, but you
have to study at any cost.

1087
01:26:02,340 --> 01:26:05,420
Leave your matter to us.
We will take care of that.

1088
01:26:05,720 --> 01:26:08,060
It is our responsibility
to unite you with Shanti.

1089
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:10,632
You do not have faith in my words?

1090
01:26:11,540 --> 01:26:14,020
And we will not have to do it,
if your Love is true..

1091
01:26:14,120 --> 01:26:14,932
..then it will unite you eventually.

1092
01:26:16,160 --> 01:26:16,660
What?

1093
01:26:18,980 --> 01:26:20,840
If our Love Is true it will
unite us eventually.

1094
01:26:29,720 --> 01:26:32,060
Bye, Babu. - Babu, come to the
college tomorrow morning.

1095
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:33,464
See you tomorrow.
- Thanks, Madhu.

1096
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:45,420
You do not need to go by foot.
I will drop you.

1097
01:26:47,580 --> 01:26:50,500
To drop you,
you need not be my friend..

1098
01:26:51,360 --> 01:26:52,900
..and you need not be
my girlfriend as well.

1099
01:26:53,980 --> 01:26:56,080
There need not be any
relation between us.

1100
01:26:56,520 --> 01:26:57,900
You can assume that while
going on road you asked..

1101
01:26:58,160 --> 01:26:59,760
..some stranger for a lift
and I would assume..

1102
01:27:00,760 --> 01:27:02,760
..that I gave a lift to a stranger.

1103
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,760
And if you still want to go
by foot it is up to you.

1104
01:27:07,060 --> 01:27:07,920
You can go by walk.

1105
01:27:09,980 --> 01:27:12,500
I am not staying in the flat now.
I am staying in the hostel.

1106
01:27:13,880 --> 01:27:17,160
I shifted to the hostel to stay
away from a few things.

1107
01:27:19,300 --> 01:27:21,900
No problem. I will drop
you there. Fine.

1108
01:27:40,980 --> 01:27:41,620
Stop it!

1109
01:28:09,820 --> 01:28:15,180
''Women say something and
mean something else.''

1110
01:28:16,020 --> 01:28:21,000
''Women say something and
mean something else.''

1111
01:28:21,900 --> 01:28:24,076
''..mean something else.''

1112
01:28:24,740 --> 01:28:26,780
''..mean something else.''

1113
01:28:27,680 --> 01:28:29,780
''..mean something else.''

1114
01:28:30,580 --> 01:28:32,612
''..mean something else.''

1115
01:28:45,220 --> 01:28:50,240
''Women say something and
mean something else.''

1116
01:28:51,080 --> 01:28:55,960
''Women say something and
mean something else.''

1117
01:29:08,520 --> 01:29:13,480
''If she gives you an angry Look
it means she likes you..''

1118
01:29:14,420 --> 01:29:19,440
''If she gives you an angry Look
it means she likes you..''

1119
01:29:20,240 --> 01:29:25,360
''When she invites you, it is better
you get lost from there.''

1120
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:31,080
''When she invites you, it is better
you get lost from there.''

1121
01:29:31,960 --> 01:29:36,980
''Women say something and
mean something else.''

1122
01:29:37,720 --> 01:29:43,000
''Women say something and
mean something else.''

1123
01:29:54,940 --> 01:30:00,280
''When they say no they mean yes.''

1124
01:30:00,920 --> 01:30:06,040
''When they say no they mean yes.''

1125
01:30:06,900 --> 01:30:11,960
''When they say yes they mean no.''

1126
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:17,640
''When they say yes they mean no.''

1127
01:30:18,580 --> 01:30:23,600
''Women say something and
mean something else.''

1128
01:30:24,420 --> 01:30:29,320
''Women say something and
mean something else.''

1129
01:30:52,300 --> 01:30:53,980
No! I have not done
anything this time.

1130
01:30:54,020 --> 01:30:55,680
Just wait for two minute.
I will check it.

1131
01:31:09,660 --> 01:31:10,222
Give me two minutes.

1132
01:31:31,140 --> 01:31:31,640
Wait.

1133
01:31:50,820 --> 01:31:52,220
No, I have not seen anything
and I do not know anything.

1134
01:32:02,240 --> 01:32:02,740
Thanks.

1135
01:32:04,620 --> 01:32:09,280
When a stranger gives me a
lift I always thank them.

1136
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:11,680
That is really wonderful.

1137
01:32:18,140 --> 01:32:18,640
I am going to..

1138
01:32:19,760 --> 01:32:21,980
Who do you think I am?
Who do you think I am?

1139
01:32:22,260 --> 01:32:24,120
You think this guy Looks like
an innocent villager..

1140
01:32:24,300 --> 01:32:25,860
..so you could fool him?

1141
01:32:26,580 --> 01:32:28,760
You were not even scared
of my moustache?

1142
01:32:29,820 --> 01:32:32,080
I am going to.. Hey, where did
I ask you to take me to?

1143
01:32:32,280 --> 01:32:34,740
To Nizam college. When I
asked you to take me to..

1144
01:32:34,860 --> 01:32:35,700
..Nizam college you should've
taken me there.

1145
01:32:36,100 --> 01:32:37,248
But you instead of taking me there..

1146
01:32:37,300 --> 01:32:39,061
..you took me around the town
and at last brought me here..

1147
01:32:39,340 --> 01:32:41,500
..to extract money from me? I
am going to.. - Sir, Leave him.

1148
01:32:41,700 --> 01:32:43,060
You want me to leave him?
Get lost from here.

1149
01:32:43,140 --> 01:32:44,960
Hey, do not think you can get
away with it. - Sir. Sir.

1150
01:32:45,640 --> 01:32:46,620
Sir. Come, I will drop you there.

1151
01:32:47,180 --> 01:32:48,480
Why do you take that trouble, son?

1152
01:32:48,840 --> 01:32:51,120
I paid him to do that job.
He should take me there.

1153
01:32:51,340 --> 01:32:52,520
You carry on. I will manage it.

1154
01:32:53,840 --> 01:32:56,120
Sir, no one can leave till you
move. Look at the traffic.

1155
01:32:56,760 --> 01:32:58,260
Come, I will also drop you there.
I am also going that way.

1156
01:32:58,480 --> 01:32:58,980
Come.
- Sir. – I will..

1157
01:32:59,500 --> 01:33:01,280
Please come, sir.

1158
01:33:05,240 --> 01:33:06,620
How do survive in this city, sir!

1159
01:33:07,220 --> 01:33:09,100
There is fraud everywhere.

1160
01:33:10,180 --> 01:33:12,540
But you Look like a
really nice person.

1161
01:33:13,760 --> 01:33:14,760
You are a good-hearted person.

1162
01:33:16,280 --> 01:33:17,544
You take everything with a smile.

1163
01:33:18,080 --> 01:33:19,480
That is what I liked most about you.

1164
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:23,240
Son, do you know my daughter?
- Who?

1165
01:33:23,500 --> 01:33:24,000
Bujji.

1166
01:33:25,620 --> 01:33:29,020
Bujji? - Yes, there are so
many kids who study here.

1167
01:33:29,260 --> 01:33:30,076
How would you know each one?

1168
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:33,180
And yes, there is a girl's hostel.
Do you at Least know that?

1169
01:33:33,580 --> 01:33:35,540
Which hostel?
- It is..

1170
01:33:37,580 --> 01:33:39,100
Durga.. What is it?

1171
01:33:41,700 --> 01:33:43,120
Durga..
- Durgabai Deshmukh?

1172
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:45,220
Yes, Durgabai Deshmukh.
Durgabal Deshmukh.

1173
01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:47,800
Well, I can never
forget that hostel.

1174
01:33:48,240 --> 01:33:49,620
There is a girl I know
in that hostel..

1175
01:33:50,260 --> 01:33:51,760
She is not just any other girl.

1176
01:33:52,160 --> 01:33:53,920
She is a girl with king-size ego.
- What is that?

1177
01:33:54,280 --> 01:33:55,480
Ego.
- What does that mean?

1178
01:33:56,940 --> 01:33:58,340
Ego. How do I explain it?

1179
01:33:59,940 --> 01:34:01,204
Yes, the feeling of superiority.

1180
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:05,340
Even lf what she had done is wrong,
she too knows that..

1181
01:34:05,800 --> 01:34:08,100
..what she has done is wrong,
but still she will not apologize.

1182
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:14,040
Even if she is down.. Got it?
Even if she is down..

1183
01:34:14,040 --> 01:34:15,320
..still she would say she
has got the upper-hand.

1184
01:34:15,740 --> 01:34:19,800
That is her feeling like.. How do
I put this! How do I put this?

1185
01:34:20,340 --> 01:34:23,380
Like a big bully. - Something
like this. Something like this.

1186
01:34:24,320 --> 01:34:26,000
She is a girl.
She is a girl after all.

1187
01:34:26,320 --> 01:34:28,940
If she can be that arrogant,
you think I am any less than her?

1188
01:34:50,220 --> 01:34:51,560
Sir, the building you can
see there is the hostel.

1189
01:34:53,380 --> 01:34:54,180
Thanks a lot, son.

1190
01:34:54,860 --> 01:34:58,100
Daddy. - Bujji.
How are you, dear? Are you fine?

1191
01:34:58,420 --> 01:35:00,700
I am fine. Where is mother?
- She wanted to come here..

1192
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:02,420
..but I left her back.
- Why are you so late then?

1193
01:35:02,680 --> 01:35:04,580
Do not ask me that.
I had a minor fight..

1194
01:35:04,580 --> 01:35:06,560
..with an auto-driver on
my way here. Then a boy..

1195
01:35:08,620 --> 01:35:10,240
Wait. I will come here in a moment.
- Daddy.

1196
01:35:10,240 --> 01:35:12,760
Son. Son.

1197
01:35:13,740 --> 01:35:18,060
Son. Son. Come here.
Yes, I am calling you. Come here.

1198
01:35:27,040 --> 01:35:27,540
Come here, dear.

1199
01:35:29,560 --> 01:35:30,060
Come here, son.

1200
01:35:36,580 --> 01:35:38,884
Bujji, I told you that I had
a fight with an auto-driver..

1201
01:35:38,940 --> 01:35:40,780
..and then a boy gave
me a lift.. It is him.

1202
01:35:41,400 --> 01:35:42,940
Son, she is my daughter. Bujji.

1203
01:35:44,660 --> 01:35:47,340
Bujji?
- That is my pet name.

1204
01:35:49,440 --> 01:35:53,460
Pet name? Good.
I am Siddhu. Siddhartha Roy.

1205
01:35:55,980 --> 01:35:57,200
Come, son. Let us have a coffee.

1206
01:35:57,247 --> 01:35:59,180
It is alright, sir.
I will make a move now. - Come on.

1207
01:35:59,340 --> 01:36:00,252
When someone comes to our place..

1208
01:36:00,740 --> 01:36:02,120
..we do not leave them before
they have a meal with us.

1209
01:36:02,440 --> 01:36:03,600
At least four hens are slain.

1210
01:36:03,900 --> 01:36:05,280
How can you leave without
even having a coffee!

1211
01:36:05,921 --> 01:36:07,361
Bujji, call him.

1212
01:36:10,400 --> 01:36:11,760
Have a coffee with us.

1213
01:36:18,220 --> 01:36:20,320
Come, son.
- Sir, I forgot to lock the car.

1214
01:36:20,620 --> 01:36:21,788
You carry on. I will lock it.

1215
01:36:21,820 --> 01:36:24,500
Ok, come soon. Come, dear. Come.

1216
01:36:26,020 --> 01:36:28,140
Bujji, I have started
Looking for a groom.

1217
01:36:28,500 --> 01:36:30,660
I came to tell you that. Is that ok?

1218
01:36:31,840 --> 01:36:33,720
Daddy, you are always
behind my marriage.

1219
01:36:34,060 --> 01:36:36,380
I do not want it.
- What is it that you do not want?

1220
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:38,200
I got you admitted in the
college as you asked.

1221
01:36:38,700 --> 01:36:40,040
Now you should Listen
to me, should not you?

1222
01:36:40,320 --> 01:36:43,060
Come here, son. Sit down.
- I will not listen to you.

1223
01:36:43,440 --> 01:36:46,300
You will not? Look, son. She is
nothing listening to her father.

1224
01:36:47,720 --> 01:36:48,872
Why do not you listen to your father?

1225
01:36:50,040 --> 01:36:51,340
You have any idea
what my father said?

1226
01:36:51,920 --> 01:36:53,600
This is something
between my father and me.

1227
01:36:54,520 --> 01:36:57,280
Do not interfere in it.
- Hey, I will slap you, girl.

1228
01:36:57,900 --> 01:36:59,997
He is our guest. You should not
be talking to him in that way.

1229
01:37:00,820 --> 01:37:02,640
Look, son.
What have I said wrong now?

1230
01:37:03,340 --> 01:37:04,900
I just said that I am
looking for a groom for her..

1231
01:37:04,920 --> 01:37:05,660
..and she is asking me to stop it.

1232
01:37:09,220 --> 01:37:11,540
What does it mean if a girl says
she does not want to..

1233
01:37:11,980 --> 01:37:13,760
..get married?
It means she loves someone.

1234
01:37:14,340 --> 01:37:18,740
Look, if you love someone,
do not be afraid to tell me.

1235
01:37:19,440 --> 01:37:23,056
I do not have any objection.
I just want to see you married.

1236
01:37:23,569 --> 01:37:26,017
But that boy must have
a heart like him.

1237
01:37:26,200 --> 01:37:26,980
What do you say, son?

1238
01:37:28,300 --> 01:37:29,620
Do tell me if there is such
a person in your life.

1239
01:37:30,700 --> 01:37:31,800
There is no one in my life.

1240
01:37:35,180 --> 01:37:36,900
If there is no one in your life,
why don't you say yes to the wedding?

1241
01:37:37,440 --> 01:37:39,360
Father, start looking for a groom.

1242
01:37:41,660 --> 01:37:43,925
It is so surprising. She did not
Listen to me even though..

1243
01:37:44,240 --> 01:37:45,440
..I said it so many times,
but she said yes..

1244
01:37:45,658 --> 01:37:46,478
..after you said it just once.

1245
01:37:46,740 --> 01:37:49,220
Son, you are really very lucky for me.

1246
01:37:49,690 --> 01:37:51,770
You solved the auto-rickshaw
problem on the way.

1247
01:37:52,080 --> 01:37:54,220
Now this wedding problem
is also solved by you.

1248
01:37:54,540 --> 01:37:56,580
Thank God my visit did not go waste.

1249
01:37:56,840 --> 01:37:59,820
I will also come with you.
Drop me on the way. Let us go, son.

1250
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:01,424
Bujji.

1251
01:38:05,040 --> 01:38:07,200
I shall go now. Let us go, son.

1252
01:38:09,003 --> 01:38:09,503
Bujji.

1253
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:11,760
There is one more thing
I want to tell you.

1254
01:38:12,400 --> 01:38:14,320
Here there is a girl he knows.

1255
01:38:15,140 --> 01:38:16,600
There is a fight between him and her.

1256
01:38:19,200 --> 01:38:20,928
It is alright, sir. Let us go.
- Wait a minute, sir.

1257
01:38:21,400 --> 01:38:22,560
You did such a huge favor on me.

1258
01:38:23,020 --> 01:38:24,520
How can I leave without doing
something for you in return?

1259
01:38:24,920 --> 01:38:28,960
Bujji, she is big bully.

1260
01:38:29,800 --> 01:38:33,575
It is.. Something superior..

1261
01:38:34,669 --> 01:38:35,997
What was that word, son..
Was it 'mental'.. What is it?

1262
01:38:37,680 --> 01:38:39,344
Is it echo?
- it's ok, sir. We shall go now.

1263
01:38:39,460 --> 01:38:42,080
Tell me that word, son. Tell me.
- Ego.

1264
01:38:44,020 --> 01:38:46,160
Yes, ego. She is a big bully
with a big ego.

1265
01:38:46,820 --> 01:38:48,980
Like people get possessed
by ghosts in our village..

1266
01:38:49,680 --> 01:38:51,008
..she is possessed by an ego.

1267
01:38:52,880 --> 01:38:55,580
You do one thing.
Talk to that girl for my sake..

1268
01:38:56,206 --> 01:38:57,786
..and tell her
that he is a good fellow..

1269
01:38:58,120 --> 01:39:00,880
..and tell her that your father
told her not to fight with him..

1270
01:39:01,200 --> 01:39:02,447
..and unite him with that girl.

1271
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:06,660
Is that sufficient, son?
Is that sufficient?

1272
01:39:06,980 --> 01:39:09,684
Or do you want me to..
- It is enough, sir.

1273
01:39:11,339 --> 01:39:13,340
Let us go, son.
What shall we call that girl..

1274
01:39:13,520 --> 01:39:16,680
..who fights with such a nice person.
It's her upbringing.

1275
01:39:17,180 --> 01:39:17,860
It is her parents fault.

1276
01:39:25,540 --> 01:39:28,980
''O dear foreigner..''

1277
01:39:35,800 --> 01:39:38,280
How can such a thing happen!
She created such a big scene..

1278
01:39:38,300 --> 01:39:40,220
..just because you looked
at her waist?

1279
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:44,286
I came here from Calcutta
at correct time.

1280
01:39:45,020 --> 01:39:48,280
Now I will give you a small idea..
- What?

1281
01:39:48,380 --> 01:39:49,740
You would forget everything.
Got it!

1282
01:39:52,020 --> 01:39:54,420
You think this is
some water packet?

1283
01:39:55,060 --> 01:39:57,140
No. It is a liquor-packet.

1284
01:39:57,720 --> 01:40:00,168
In Hyderabad they call it 'gudumba'.

1285
01:40:00,580 --> 01:40:02,922
If you take one packet..
- Hey, get lost!

1286
01:40:04,040 --> 01:40:06,640
It is great. Try it. - You know I
don't have the habit of drinking?

1287
01:40:07,260 --> 01:40:09,740
So you think I am a drunkard?
Will I pass out?

1288
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:10,637
What are you, man!

1289
01:40:12,274 --> 01:40:12,774
Take it.

1290
01:40:14,220 --> 01:40:16,120
Cut it. Cut it.

1291
01:40:18,580 --> 01:40:19,360
Pour in it. Pour in it.

1292
01:40:20,320 --> 01:40:21,080
You cut it well.

1293
01:40:25,040 --> 01:40:27,434
Lean forward. Lean forward. Have it.

1294
01:40:27,680 --> 01:40:28,900
That is it. It is over. It is over.

1295
01:40:30,640 --> 01:40:31,800
Now have this. Have this.

1296
01:40:36,700 --> 01:40:37,200
How's it?

1297
01:40:40,340 --> 01:40:42,480
Is it spinning? Yes, you would spin.

1298
01:40:43,120 --> 01:40:43,770
Now Look at me.

1299
01:40:50,980 --> 01:40:51,480
Put that here.

1300
01:40:57,920 --> 01:40:58,732
Now start a song.

1301
01:41:06,160 --> 01:41:09,249
''Rongoboti, Rongoboti..''

1302
01:41:11,440 --> 01:41:14,736
''Rongoboti, Rongoboti,
kholo kholo..''

1303
01:41:14,940 --> 01:41:16,340
What! You are singing
Rongoboti song?

1304
01:41:16,960 --> 01:41:20,160
No Oriya. Telugu. Srikakulum.
Your father's native.

1305
01:41:20,380 --> 01:41:22,920
Srikakulum song? - Yes, right.
- You should say it clearly.

1306
01:41:23,680 --> 01:41:26,700
''O dear Ravanamma.''

1307
01:41:27,940 --> 01:41:30,930
''There is a hand-pump near the pond.''

1308
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,780
''O dear Ravanamma.''

1309
01:41:36,220 --> 01:41:38,651
''There is a hand-pump near the pond.''

1310
01:41:39,320 --> 01:41:44,760
''By the time you return
I will be in my own palace.''

1311
01:41:45,140 --> 01:41:47,700
''I am a girl who lives in a palace.''

1312
01:41:48,198 --> 01:41:50,598
''I am a girl who lives in a palace.''

1313
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,255
''And you are keeping me in a hut.''

1314
01:41:53,660 --> 01:41:56,140
''O barber, O mischievous barber.''

1315
01:41:56,580 --> 01:41:59,140
''O dear, come to me.''

1316
01:41:59,766 --> 01:42:02,166
''O dear, come to me.''

1317
01:42:02,480 --> 01:42:05,249
''There is a bus on that side,
there is a bus on this side.''

1318
01:42:05,560 --> 01:42:07,880
''We shall travel in a bus
between them, Ravanamma.''

1319
01:42:08,380 --> 01:42:10,500
''There is a train on that side,
there a train on this side..''

1320
01:42:11,120 --> 01:42:13,940
''We shall travel in a train
between them, Ravanamma.''

1321
01:42:14,580 --> 01:42:16,640
I forgot the next line.
- What is there!

1322
01:42:16,740 --> 01:42:18,100
The train has left, the bus has
left, the packets are also over.

1323
01:42:18,240 --> 01:42:19,024
I will do one thing.
- What?

1324
01:42:19,080 --> 01:42:21,340
I will go and bring the packets.
Till then you have a cigarette.

1325
01:42:26,580 --> 01:42:27,461
Hey, do not forget
to bring cigarettes.

1326
01:42:35,400 --> 01:42:37,560
'Every time you smoke
and flick ash in it..'

1327
01:42:37,983 --> 01:42:40,423
'..you should remember me.
You should feel like..'

1328
01:42:40,423 --> 01:42:41,668
'..you are flicking ash on me.'

1329
01:42:55,220 --> 01:42:57,580
Hey, what are you staring at!

1330
01:42:58,300 --> 01:42:58,800
Stop.

1331
01:43:00,140 --> 01:43:01,046
You are dancing in front of me?

1332
01:43:02,500 --> 01:43:03,104
Stop.

1333
01:43:04,340 --> 01:43:05,202
What are you staring at!

1334
01:43:05,920 --> 01:43:08,560
What! What! What are you
staring at! Tell me.

1335
01:43:09,520 --> 01:43:11,200
You have to tell me.

1336
01:43:15,940 --> 01:43:22,180
With such big eyes why are
you looking at me? Tell me.

1337
01:43:43,500 --> 01:43:45,100
It is this much..

1338
01:43:45,660 --> 01:43:46,553
That is it. This much.

1339
01:43:49,360 --> 01:43:51,264
Just a bit more.

1340
01:43:53,220 --> 01:43:55,600
It is less than four inches
and she says I saw it.

1341
01:43:56,300 --> 01:43:57,380
You think you are beautiful?

1342
01:43:58,960 --> 01:44:01,660
Such a small face,
a small rat-like nose..

1343
01:44:02,040 --> 01:44:04,020
..a pair of small swollen lips.

1344
01:44:05,760 --> 01:44:08,100
And tender but attractive waist.

1345
01:44:09,040 --> 01:44:11,380
You wore a black sari and
covered your entire body..

1346
01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:14,020
..a red-coloured body,
Like a ripe Lemon.

1347
01:44:14,740 --> 01:44:18,920
A ripe Lemon looks yellow.
Ok, so a mixture of red and yellow..

1348
01:44:19,028 --> 01:44:20,328
..which forms a romantic color.
In such romantic color..

1349
01:44:20,800 --> 01:44:23,680
..a small area was visible,
eye would definitely fall on that.

1350
01:44:24,020 --> 01:44:25,000
That is the nature of the eyes.

1351
01:44:25,500 --> 01:44:26,910
You should not have exposed that part.

1352
01:44:28,400 --> 01:44:31,760
Face is a part of your body.
Waist is a part of your body.

1353
01:44:32,378 --> 01:44:33,698
You did not get angry
when I saw your face..

1354
01:44:33,860 --> 01:44:35,700
..but you got angry
when I saw your waist. Why?

1355
01:44:36,220 --> 01:44:38,460
I ask you why. That is it.

1356
01:44:39,820 --> 01:44:42,340
Now not just your waist,
but I will see your entire body.

1357
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:54,300
You do not even deserve
to stand next to me.

1358
01:45:06,300 --> 01:45:06,800
I am going to..

1359
01:45:20,380 --> 01:45:22,420
Madhu. It cannot be Madhu.

1360
01:45:24,360 --> 01:45:24,860
Madhu.

1361
01:45:26,240 --> 01:45:28,420
Madhu. Madhu. I am sorry..
- No.

1362
01:45:28,760 --> 01:45:31,092
Do not touch. Do not touch it. No.

1363
01:45:36,180 --> 01:45:39,660
Madhu, it is..
- You have no right to touch this.

1364
01:45:46,100 --> 01:45:47,608
O God! O God!

1365
01:45:53,520 --> 01:45:54,280
I am sorry, Madhu.

1366
01:45:55,669 --> 01:45:57,635
I came to talk to you about
something very important.

1367
01:45:58,360 --> 01:45:59,420
But now you are not in
a mood to hear it..

1368
01:46:00,048 --> 01:46:02,331
..and I am not in a mood to talk
about it. - I am sorry, Madhu.

1369
01:46:02,400 --> 01:46:03,060
I am really sorry.

1370
01:46:05,080 --> 01:46:06,000
Oh no!

1371
01:46:10,120 --> 01:46:11,600
I am sorry, Madhu. I am sorry.

1372
01:46:12,340 --> 01:46:12,840
Madhu.

1373
01:46:15,100 --> 01:46:20,400
My rascal friend poured liquor in my mouth
even though I tried to stop it.

1374
01:46:22,700 --> 01:46:24,780
You can drink, you can smoke,
you can do anything..

1375
01:46:25,100 --> 01:46:26,460
How does it bother me!
Who are you to me!

1376
01:46:26,860 --> 01:46:30,080
Why should I worry if someone in
this world smokes and drinks!

1377
01:46:30,500 --> 01:46:33,180
I do not need to know
why you are drinking.

1378
01:46:34,520 --> 01:46:35,064
Madhu.

1379
01:46:36,760 --> 01:46:37,304
Hello!

1380
01:46:40,120 --> 01:46:43,431
You evil human, you ruined
my life. Rascal.

1381
01:46:43,935 --> 01:46:47,837
You evil human, you ruined my life.

1382
01:46:48,260 --> 01:46:51,105
I had this wrong impression
that you are a good person..

1383
01:46:52,060 --> 01:46:56,226
..but now I realized that you
are far greater than that.

1384
01:46:56,360 --> 01:46:57,435
He ruined my life.
- Goodbye.

1385
01:47:03,480 --> 01:47:07,332
He came here from Calcutta
only to ruin my life.

1386
01:47:10,500 --> 01:47:12,660
Come here, son.
Come here. Come here.

1387
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,133
I will kick you. I will kick you.

1388
01:47:16,740 --> 01:47:20,000
I am so happy to see you today.

1389
01:47:20,400 --> 01:47:21,980
My heart is overflowing with joy.

1390
01:47:22,120 --> 01:47:23,847
Come here, son. Come here.

1391
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,500
Did she compromise?
- Compromise?

1392
01:47:29,320 --> 01:47:30,840
Not this one. Cheap quality.

1393
01:47:32,420 --> 01:47:33,196
Gudumba costly.

1394
01:47:36,560 --> 01:47:38,272
Stop. Stop.

1395
01:47:39,894 --> 01:47:41,371
Is this why you came here?
Is this why?

1396
01:47:41,760 --> 01:47:43,780
Scoundrel. Scoundrel.

1397
01:47:44,100 --> 01:47:47,500
You came here only to ruin my life.
Scoundrel. - Me?

1398
01:47:49,320 --> 01:47:52,114
''Waist is an illusion.''

1399
01:47:53,360 --> 01:47:56,415
''The world is an illusion.''

1400
01:47:59,900 --> 01:48:04,660
''That is what our Vedas say.''

1401
01:48:06,180 --> 01:48:08,120
I thought the song is great.
So I gave some music.

1402
01:48:08,260 --> 01:48:09,160
Oh God! Oh God!

1403
01:48:55,100 --> 01:48:58,114
Did you learn all the steps?
- Master, just that one step..

1404
01:48:58,340 --> 01:49:00,500
I could not pick it up. - You can
pick up this girl so easily..

1405
01:49:00,720 --> 01:49:02,780
..but you cannot pick up
a dance step. - Master.

1406
01:49:03,640 --> 01:49:06,246
I should not reveal such secrets, right?
Coming to the point.

1407
01:49:06,720 --> 01:49:07,560
The next step is..

1408
01:49:10,080 --> 01:49:12,320
Everyone would lift their
right leg in this step.

1409
01:49:12,520 --> 01:49:14,700
Next step, master.
- The next step is..

1410
01:49:17,400 --> 01:49:19,540
In this step everyone will have to
lift both their legs at a time.

1411
01:49:19,940 --> 01:49:22,140
But we would fall lf we do that.
- You have to fall.

1412
01:49:22,660 --> 01:49:25,380
That is the Latest school of dance.
Hi, Mala!

1413
01:49:25,520 --> 01:49:27,347
Hi, master.
- How are you? - Fine.

1414
01:49:27,540 --> 01:49:29,219
Carry on. Bye.
- Bye.

1415
01:49:29,320 --> 01:49:30,040
The next step is..
- Master.

1416
01:49:30,960 --> 01:49:34,080
How did you find out without
Looking back that it was Mala!

1417
01:49:34,400 --> 01:49:36,360
The smell. It is the smell.
Bad smell.

1418
01:49:36,660 --> 01:49:38,120
You think they bath regularly?

1419
01:49:38,480 --> 01:49:39,368
They stink.

1420
01:49:40,951 --> 01:49:42,071
Where is this fragrance coming from?

1421
01:49:45,020 --> 01:49:47,760
Hi, Madhu. Hold it. One moment.

1422
01:49:48,360 --> 01:49:49,859
Hi, Madhu.
- Hi, master.

1423
01:49:50,080 --> 01:49:52,097
How are you?
- Great. - Maintain that.

1424
01:49:52,280 --> 01:49:54,440
Let us come to the point.
This year's college cultural programs..

1425
01:49:54,475 --> 01:49:57,114
..are nearing. From tomorrow
onwards we are about to start..

1426
01:49:57,271 --> 01:49:58,851
..the rehearsals. Siddhu asked
everyone to practice the dance.

1427
01:49:59,080 --> 01:50:01,100
From tomorrow you will be
practicing with Siddhu. Ok?

1428
01:50:01,500 --> 01:50:02,853
No, master.
- Yes.

1429
01:50:03,540 --> 01:50:04,958
I am not participating
ln this program. - Why?

1430
01:50:05,800 --> 01:50:08,920
I said no. Leave it there.
- I am not some tea-master..

1431
01:50:09,080 --> 01:50:10,780
..to leave it so easily.
I am a dance-master.

1432
01:50:11,100 --> 01:50:12,500
Do not turn me into a kung-fu master.

1433
01:50:12,720 --> 01:50:14,220
The program you did together
on stage Last year..

1434
01:50:14,300 --> 01:50:16,880
..was a super-hit.
Again you have to come together and..

1435
01:50:17,120 --> 01:50:20,560
Master, please. Please leave it there.
- Ok, it is alright.

1436
01:50:21,080 --> 01:50:22,620
Bad luck for you.
Good luck next time.

1437
01:50:22,940 --> 01:50:24,800
Raghu.
- Master. - Let us do one thing.

1438
01:50:25,220 --> 01:50:27,840
Let us put club Anita with Siddhu
this year. - Ok, master.

1439
01:50:28,560 --> 01:50:29,640
Waste of time.
- Master.

1440
01:50:30,220 --> 01:50:32,500
Yes, what again?
- Who is Anita?

1441
01:50:32,860 --> 01:50:35,640
What a stupid question you
are asking. Who is Anita?

1442
01:50:36,100 --> 01:50:38,860
Anita is a beautiful babe who
joined our college recently.

1443
01:50:39,140 --> 01:50:42,400
The moment she joined there
was hysteria in the college.

1444
01:50:42,840 --> 01:50:46,620
Every student has turned blind
for that girl. - Why?

1445
01:50:47,580 --> 01:50:49,760
An unfortunate incident took
place in that girl's life.

1446
01:50:50,560 --> 01:50:53,200
That girl had a blind brother.
One day when he was..

1447
01:50:53,300 --> 01:50:56,256
..crossing the road a Lorry
ran over him and he died.

1448
01:50:56,780 --> 01:50:59,620
From then on wards whenever a
blind man crosses the road..

1449
01:51:00,120 --> 01:51:02,200
..she holds his hand and
helps him cross the road.

1450
01:51:02,580 --> 01:51:05,160
For that one touch of her hand
all the guys from our college..

1451
01:51:05,440 --> 01:51:07,880
..are buying black goggles
ln Sultan Bazar..

1452
01:51:08,300 --> 01:51:10,100
..and moving in front of that
girl like blind fellows.

1453
01:51:10,360 --> 01:51:12,200
I am also going out on that
particular work right now.

1454
01:51:12,340 --> 01:51:15,040
She is so modern, but still
has such a big heart.

1455
01:51:15,360 --> 01:51:16,820
I shall go now. Bye.

1456
01:51:43,249 --> 01:51:45,169
Excuse me.
- Yes.

1457
01:51:45,580 --> 01:51:49,520
Madam, can you help me
cross the road? - Why?

1458
01:51:50,140 --> 01:51:54,687
Because I am blind.
- How unfortunate!

1459
01:52:23,500 --> 01:52:27,720
Sir, you crossed the road.
- Such a narrow road.

1460
01:52:28,080 --> 01:52:31,259
What!
- Anyhow, I thank your big heart..

1461
01:52:31,259 --> 01:52:34,019
..for helping out this blind fellow.

1462
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:36,960
It is ok. Thanks.

1463
01:52:39,640 --> 01:52:40,580
Just miss!

1464
01:52:42,220 --> 01:52:43,680
What would I do with this now!
It is of no use.

1465
01:52:48,880 --> 01:52:49,380
Siddhu.

1466
01:52:56,320 --> 01:52:58,507
What?
- Shanti gave me a Letter.

1467
01:52:59,080 --> 01:53:00,980
Then give it to Babu.
- It is not for Babu.

1468
01:53:01,379 --> 01:53:02,227
It is for me?
- No.

1469
01:53:02,460 --> 01:53:03,220
It is for you?
- No.

1470
01:53:03,360 --> 01:53:04,460
If it is not for you, if it is
not for me, then who is it for?

1471
01:53:04,540 --> 01:53:07,480
It is for us.
- I see. It is for us.

1472
01:53:12,720 --> 01:53:16,768
To Mr. Siddhu
and Miss. Madhu. Great.

1473
01:53:21,680 --> 01:53:22,180
It is so..

1474
01:53:24,080 --> 01:53:26,442
Someone glued it very strong.

1475
01:53:27,023 --> 01:53:28,583
It is quite difficult to open it.

1476
01:53:32,180 --> 01:53:32,802
You read it.

1477
01:53:37,720 --> 01:53:41,240
To dear Siddhu and Madhu,
this is from Shanti.

1478
01:53:41,940 --> 01:53:44,940
No one in this world
would have loved anyone..

1479
01:53:45,280 --> 01:53:46,560
..as much as I loved Babu.

1480
01:53:47,980 --> 01:53:50,760
What! You think every
Lover says the same.

1481
01:53:51,680 --> 01:53:56,540
Might be. No matter whatever
anyone says love is love.

1482
01:53:57,700 --> 01:53:59,300
Pain is pain.

1483
01:54:00,800 --> 01:54:04,060
Please I want to see Babu.
Your friend Shanti.

1484
01:54:06,320 --> 01:54:07,140
What shall we do now?

1485
01:54:10,560 --> 01:54:13,472
Shanti has a friend
called Fatima, right?

1486
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:22,920
Babu, take care.
- Ok.

1487
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:27,920
This gun had some rest after
four hours fight.

1488
01:54:28,320 --> 01:54:30,980
Shanti, you talk to your friend,
I am going to bed.

1489
01:54:38,360 --> 01:54:39,960
Shanti, who is this girl?

1490
01:54:41,360 --> 01:54:42,860
She is Fatima's friend
Farida, daddy.

1491
01:54:49,900 --> 01:54:51,540
Dear, Farida did not see
our house before, right?

1492
01:54:52,040 --> 01:54:53,720
Yes, daddy.
- Then you do one thing.

1493
01:54:54,380 --> 01:54:57,220
You give company to Fatima.
I will show Farida the house.

1494
01:54:57,280 --> 01:54:58,620
Babu, run away.
- Stop.

1495
01:54:59,880 --> 01:55:02,260
Daddy, no. No, daddy.
- Move aside.

1496
01:55:54,780 --> 01:55:55,500
Tiger.

1497
01:55:56,240 --> 01:55:59,240
Hey! What!
- Siddhu, come. Let us dance.

1498
01:56:16,320 --> 01:56:16,820
Move aside.

1499
01:56:22,960 --> 01:56:25,340
Please. Thank you.

1500
01:59:23,640 --> 01:59:24,140
I am sorry.

1501
01:59:58,420 --> 01:59:58,920
Siddhu.

1502
02:00:12,600 --> 02:00:13,100
Siddhu.

1503
02:00:22,420 --> 02:00:23,000
Siddhu.

1504
02:00:31,820 --> 02:00:34,600
Siddhu.
- Madhu. Bingo, bring the car.

1505
02:00:41,500 --> 02:00:43,840
Get into the car. Open the door.

1506
02:00:44,760 --> 02:00:45,780
Get into the car.

1507
02:00:49,360 --> 02:00:50,860
Move. Move. Move. Move.

1508
02:01:11,260 --> 02:01:12,460
Madhu, are you fine?

1509
02:02:17,600 --> 02:02:20,300
Hello! Hey, man! Who are you?

1510
02:02:20,660 --> 02:02:22,880
How are you related this girl?
- I am actually..

1511
02:02:23,720 --> 02:02:25,380
Ok, whoever you are.
We need give her an injection.

1512
02:02:25,440 --> 02:02:26,093
Help us out.

1513
02:02:29,780 --> 02:02:30,280
May I?

1514
02:02:38,520 --> 02:02:39,020
Hey, man!

1515
02:02:40,193 --> 02:02:42,259
Not there, near waist.
- Ok.

1516
02:02:43,980 --> 02:02:46,480
No. - What! - No, doctor.
Give her that injection on hand.

1517
02:02:46,540 --> 02:02:47,720
But this injection cannot
be given on the hand.

1518
02:02:47,720 --> 02:02:49,020
Doctor, Listen to me and give
her that injection the hand.

1519
02:02:49,800 --> 02:02:50,940
The injection that should
be given on hand..

1520
02:02:50,960 --> 02:02:51,720
..will be given on hand and the
injection that should be..

1521
02:02:51,880 --> 02:02:52,690
..given on waist will
be given on waist.

1522
02:02:53,060 --> 02:02:54,212
And this is an injection
to be given on the waist.

1523
02:02:54,280 --> 02:02:55,878
Doctor, you do not know
about this waist.

1524
02:02:56,040 --> 02:02:57,218
Please give her that
injection on hand.

1525
02:02:57,980 --> 02:03:00,620
You do not know this matter
related to the waist.

1526
02:03:01,120 --> 02:03:03,280
This waist created a lot
of problems, doctor.

1527
02:03:03,980 --> 02:03:04,900
Lot of problems did not
believe it when they said..

1528
02:03:04,960 --> 02:03:06,285
..that two families separated
because of cock-fights.

1529
02:03:06,640 --> 02:03:08,173
did not believe it when
they said two kingdoms..

1530
02:03:08,280 --> 02:03:09,840
..were destroyed because of
a tile, I did not believe it..

1531
02:03:10,020 --> 02:03:11,645
I thought that these are
just rumors, doctor.

1532
02:03:11,820 --> 02:03:12,820
I thought that these are rumors.

1533
02:03:13,500 --> 02:03:15,434
But after I faced so many
problems because of..

1534
02:03:15,500 --> 02:03:18,842
..such a small waist I had to
believe those stories, doctor.

1535
02:03:18,940 --> 02:03:19,691
I had to believe those stories.

1536
02:03:20,700 --> 02:03:21,947
To explain all these
things clearly..

1537
02:03:22,060 --> 02:03:22,932
..It will take me
two hours, doctors.

1538
02:03:23,200 --> 02:03:24,070
It will take me two hours.

1539
02:03:26,500 --> 02:03:28,800
That is why, listen to me and give
her that injection on hand.

1540
02:03:29,380 --> 02:03:30,780
Who is the doctor? You or me?

1541
02:03:31,700 --> 02:03:33,957
It is you.
- Nurse, send him out.

1542
02:03:34,480 --> 02:03:36,600
Then it is ok.
You can give that injection..

1543
02:03:36,740 --> 02:03:38,940
..on this side or the waist,
or on this side of the waist.

1544
02:03:39,220 --> 02:03:40,391
You can give that
injection anywhere.

1545
02:03:40,700 --> 02:03:42,400
I do not know anything.
I am leaving.

1546
02:03:43,600 --> 02:03:45,840
There are waists everywhere.

1547
02:03:47,500 --> 02:03:49,380
It is such a small area,
but it creates so many problems.

1548
02:04:14,660 --> 02:04:21,460
''O my beloved one,
are you upset with me?''

1549
02:04:23,780 --> 02:04:30,240
''Stop it, dear. You are kidding me?''

1550
02:04:31,760 --> 02:04:35,807
''There is no place for anger
and resentment between us.''

1551
02:04:36,260 --> 02:04:40,100
''We must spend our Lives happily.''

1552
02:04:40,860 --> 02:04:44,368
''There is no place
for differences between us.''

1553
02:04:45,380 --> 02:04:49,272
''Ours must be
the strongest bond on earth.''

1554
02:05:24,480 --> 02:05:28,000
''The bud did not blossom till now.''

1555
02:05:28,300 --> 02:05:32,100
''But it blossomed
once the breeze touched it.''

1556
02:05:32,940 --> 02:05:37,240
''Is it breeze's victory
or is it bud's defeat?''

1557
02:05:38,040 --> 02:05:41,860
''The statue hides inside a rock..''

1558
02:05:42,200 --> 02:05:45,995
''..but it surfaces
when a chisel touches it.''

1559
02:05:46,720 --> 02:05:50,905
''Is it chisel's victory
or statue's defeat?''

1560
02:05:51,435 --> 02:05:55,832
''Who would explain
us the difference?''

1561
02:05:56,140 --> 02:05:59,780
''Who would clear our doubts?''

1562
02:06:00,680 --> 02:06:04,440
''What is hidden
in our eyes is a dream.''

1563
02:06:05,100 --> 02:06:08,900
''What is hidden
in our thoughts is repose.''

1564
02:06:15,500 --> 02:06:22,120
''O my beloved one,
are you upset with me?''

1565
02:06:51,080 --> 02:06:54,600
''When the clouds collide with air..''

1566
02:06:54,906 --> 02:06:58,506
''..they take the form of rain.''

1567
02:06:59,580 --> 02:07:03,640
''Is that a fight or is that nature?''

1568
02:07:04,800 --> 02:07:08,540
''When two pair of eyes
come in contact..''

1569
02:07:08,840 --> 02:07:12,320
''..they take the form of Love.''

1570
02:07:13,249 --> 02:07:17,595
''Is that Armageddon
or is that love?''

1571
02:07:18,220 --> 02:07:21,700
''Who would tell me about you?''

1572
02:07:22,740 --> 02:07:26,260
''Who would clear my doubts?''

1573
02:07:27,380 --> 02:07:31,195
''The Lips would tell
you the stories.''

1574
02:07:31,960 --> 02:07:35,480
''Your Love is hidden in the heart.''

1575
02:07:42,180 --> 02:07:48,700
''O my beloved one,
are you upset with me?''

1576
02:08:04,580 --> 02:08:06,000
Greetings, sir. I need
to talk to you.

1577
02:08:06,140 --> 02:08:08,240
I have been trying to talk to
you since a long time, but..

1578
02:08:08,520 --> 02:08:10,340
..I did not get an appointment.
I tried in your office, but..

1579
02:08:10,440 --> 02:08:12,220
Hey, what is the matter!
Sir does not have time..

1580
02:08:13,180 --> 02:08:15,380
..to talk to a fool like you.
Now get lost from here. Get Lost.

1581
02:08:15,660 --> 02:08:17,160
Get lost.

1582
02:08:18,580 --> 02:08:23,200
Hey, when big people talk kids
should not interfere. Got it?

1583
02:08:23,820 --> 02:08:25,420
Sir, you sent men to knock me down.

1584
02:08:25,700 --> 02:08:26,960
I am that Siddhu Siddhartha Roy.

1585
02:08:28,220 --> 02:08:30,020
Sir, you think your men
can take a person's Life?

1586
02:08:30,560 --> 02:08:32,047
Only He has the power to
take a person's Life.

1587
02:08:32,360 --> 02:08:34,739
Sir, I need to talk to
you for two minutes.

1588
02:08:35,380 --> 02:08:36,996
I will say what l want
to say and leave.

1589
02:08:37,120 --> 02:08:37,740
Do not say no. Please.

1590
02:08:39,900 --> 02:08:41,480
Please, sir. Do not say no.
- Leave my hand.

1591
02:08:42,100 --> 02:08:43,580
He is a kid. He cannot
bear it for too Long.

1592
02:08:47,160 --> 02:08:50,380
Sorry, sir. He did not Listen to me.

1593
02:08:51,280 --> 02:08:53,440
Sir, I am Siddhu Siddhartha Roy.

1594
02:08:53,680 --> 02:08:56,620
And you are Satti. You are
known as Mr. Gudumba Satti.

1595
02:08:58,120 --> 02:08:59,714
Sir, I came here to talk about Babu.

1596
02:09:00,180 --> 02:09:02,760
Even the biggest success stories
started from the bottom.

1597
02:09:03,280 --> 02:09:05,780
Even you started out as a
local goon and today..

1598
02:09:07,440 --> 02:09:08,198
What is there in the money, sir!

1599
02:09:09,520 --> 02:09:11,000
Babu has a good heart.

1600
02:09:12,060 --> 02:09:14,642
And the reason Shanti fell in Love
with him is his good heart.

1601
02:09:16,520 --> 02:09:18,560
The happiness Shanti would get
as Babu's wife would be..

1602
02:09:19,120 --> 02:09:21,920
..ten times greater than what
she gets being your daughter.

1603
02:09:24,470 --> 02:09:26,610
If a boy gets his girl
without any hurdle..

1604
02:09:26,680 --> 02:09:30,960
..he would consider himself
the luckiest person on earth.

1605
02:09:32,935 --> 02:09:34,407
Please unite them, sir.

1606
02:09:39,020 --> 02:09:41,580
Two minutes are not over
yet and I have already..

1607
02:09:42,400 --> 02:09:44,160
..completed what I had to say.
It is up to you now.

1608
02:09:50,920 --> 02:09:53,060
Two minutes over. Start the car.

1609
02:10:04,020 --> 02:10:04,940
He did not say anything else?

1610
02:10:06,340 --> 02:10:07,700
He said two minutes are
over and then Left.

1611
02:10:09,319 --> 02:10:10,739
Even though he had not
said anything..

1612
02:10:12,040 --> 02:10:15,020
..could you sense what was
in his heart? - What!

1613
02:10:16,785 --> 02:10:19,721
Could you sense what was
there in his heart?

1614
02:10:20,860 --> 02:10:21,840
There would no problem in
this world if we have..

1615
02:10:21,900 --> 02:10:22,986
..the power to find out what
ls there in others' hearts.

1616
02:10:23,408 --> 02:10:24,408
All these problems are there
because we do not know that.

1617
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:25,882
'All these problems' means?

1618
02:10:26,340 --> 02:10:27,560
'All these problems' means
'all these problems'?

1619
02:10:29,240 --> 02:10:31,088
Ok, I will go now.

1620
02:10:31,740 --> 02:10:32,281
Madhu.

1621
02:10:37,220 --> 02:10:37,720
Did you call me?

1622
02:10:41,299 --> 02:10:44,584
What?
- I need to talk to you.

1623
02:10:45,140 --> 02:10:46,620
I think that is what we did till now.

1624
02:10:48,940 --> 02:10:50,980
I need to say something personal.

1625
02:10:56,529 --> 02:11:01,926
About what?
- You arrogant girl! About what?

1626
02:11:04,520 --> 02:11:09,557
It is about what you think it is about.
- I did not think anything.

1627
02:11:09,820 --> 02:11:10,960
You said you wanted to
talk about something.

1628
02:11:11,340 --> 02:11:12,060
Tell me what it is.

1629
02:11:34,303 --> 02:11:34,873
Bye.

1630
02:11:36,481 --> 02:11:39,321
Bye.
- You called me back to say that?

1631
02:11:42,700 --> 02:11:45,720
Ok, bye.
- Cool.

1632
02:11:53,440 --> 02:11:54,968
Sexy girl.
- Look at his style.

1633
02:11:57,040 --> 02:11:59,020
One. Two. Three. Four.

1634
02:12:20,120 --> 02:12:21,813
Will you come to Khandala?

1635
02:12:22,460 --> 02:12:24,812
Why Khandala? We would
take him to Gandipet.

1636
02:12:25,766 --> 02:12:28,718
''I am a beautiful babe.
I am Kanakamu from Kottapeta.''

1637
02:12:29,738 --> 02:12:33,583
''You will be intoxicated if I wink.
You will go mad if I touch you.''

1638
02:12:34,340 --> 02:12:38,685
''If you give me a silk sari
I will tell you all my secrets.''

1639
02:12:39,520 --> 02:12:43,582
''If you give me a green note
I will teach you all the skills.''

1640
02:12:44,680 --> 02:12:47,204
''If I dance all the nearby
villages will shake.''

1641
02:12:57,300 --> 02:13:01,400
''I am a beautiful babe.
I am Kanakamu from Kottapeta.''

1642
02:13:02,120 --> 02:13:06,862
''You will be intoxicated if I wink.
You will go mad if you touch me.''

1643
02:13:08,060 --> 02:13:10,900
Go. Go.
- Ajay, Anita is here.

1644
02:13:11,440 --> 02:13:13,380
Siddhu is a dead man today.

1645
02:13:18,020 --> 02:13:20,440
Anita, not that much. Cut it down.

1646
02:13:33,200 --> 02:13:34,913
Master.
- Stop it.

1647
02:13:35,640 --> 02:13:38,860
''My beloved one is not with me.''

1648
02:13:39,180 --> 02:13:42,020
Hi, guys! Class is over.
We will meet tomorrow.

1649
02:13:42,240 --> 02:13:43,940
Siddhu, you too.
- Get Lost. - Bye.

1650
02:13:44,820 --> 02:13:45,680
Shall we go to a movie?

1651
02:13:46,440 --> 02:13:47,880
There is no one in my room.
Shall we go to my room?

1652
02:13:48,020 --> 02:13:48,760
I will slap you with my sandal.

1653
02:13:51,220 --> 02:13:55,060
Siddhu. I need to talk to you.

1654
02:13:55,880 --> 02:13:58,420
I need you. I Love you.
- It is..

1655
02:13:58,540 --> 02:14:01,060
There are so many men
who are chasing me..

1656
02:14:01,300 --> 02:14:03,860
..but you are the one I fell for?

1657
02:14:04,300 --> 02:14:05,320
You fell for me?

1658
02:14:06,020 --> 02:14:06,760
O Lord Krishna.

1659
02:14:07,580 --> 02:14:08,458
These eyes..

1660
02:14:10,702 --> 02:14:12,012
This nose..

1661
02:14:15,140 --> 02:14:16,342
These Lips..

1662
02:14:18,940 --> 02:14:21,436
And then..
- Anita. Anita. Anita. Anita.

1663
02:14:21,640 --> 02:14:23,440
You can Love me.
You can lust for me.

1664
02:14:23,780 --> 02:14:25,360
You can think about me
in any way..

1665
02:14:25,520 --> 02:14:26,882
..but there is no possibility
from my side..

1666
02:14:35,440 --> 02:14:38,160
..to turn you down.
- O thanks!

1667
02:14:40,020 --> 02:14:42,080
Anita, these things are new
to me as well. That is why..

1668
02:14:43,040 --> 02:14:43,940
Anita. Anita.

1669
02:14:45,500 --> 02:14:51,160
Siddhu, no problem. You can
take as much time you want.

1670
02:14:51,780 --> 02:14:55,340
Siddhu. - Yes.
- Can I put my hand around you?

1671
02:14:56,680 --> 02:14:58,260
Ya.
- Thanks.

1672
02:14:58,960 --> 02:15:00,640
Ya. No problem.
Feel free, Anita.

1673
02:15:01,480 --> 02:15:04,140
You are also very beautiful.
Your eyes. Your nose. Mouth.

1674
02:15:05,837 --> 02:15:08,817
Cool. I will show some
nice dance moves.

1675
02:15:08,965 --> 02:15:10,567
One step to your right
and one step to your left.

1676
02:15:11,240 --> 02:15:12,500
One step to your right..
- Siddhu.

1677
02:15:14,900 --> 02:15:15,580
Siddhu.

1678
02:15:16,960 --> 02:15:18,480
Hi, Madhu! When did you come?

1679
02:15:21,900 --> 02:15:25,040
Hi. - I am not tensed that
there is a girl in your arms..

1680
02:15:25,700 --> 02:15:28,360
I am not tensed that you are
making diagrams on her body..

1681
02:15:29,180 --> 02:15:31,125
..with your finger, nor did
I come here to disturb you.

1682
02:15:33,260 --> 02:15:34,960
We have to be at
Shanti's house by 7:30.

1683
02:15:35,360 --> 02:15:37,880
Right now it is 7 O'cLock.
You did not forget it, did you?

1684
02:15:38,580 --> 02:15:40,940
I did not forget it.
- Siddhu. - Yes.

1685
02:15:41,080 --> 02:15:44,160
Who is she? Your friend?
- No.

1686
02:15:44,220 --> 02:15:47,680
My friend? No.
- Is she your Lover?

1687
02:15:48,500 --> 02:15:51,080
My Lover? No. No. No.
Not at all.

1688
02:15:51,200 --> 02:15:52,760
There needs to be some qualities
to be my lover.

1689
02:15:52,800 --> 02:15:56,860
My range is too high.
- Then who is she?

1690
02:15:58,520 --> 02:16:00,513
That girl's name is Madhu.

1691
02:16:00,720 --> 02:16:02,020
I do not know anything more
than that. Do not ask me.

1692
02:16:04,320 --> 02:16:05,660
Siddhu, we will leave?

1693
02:16:08,880 --> 02:16:12,199
Ok, Anita. Let us meet again.
- Siddhu. - Yes.

1694
02:16:12,540 --> 02:16:15,860
When will we meet again?
- Sunday. Next Sunday.

1695
02:16:16,440 --> 02:16:18,980
Shall we meet for Lunch?
- No. No. No. Dinner. Dinner.

1697
02:16:21,620 --> 02:16:23,000
We are gonna have a nice
romantic dinner. Ok?

1698
02:16:23,360 --> 02:16:25,640

Yes.

1701
02:16:31,320 --> 02:16:34,220
Naughty Anita. Very naughty.

1702
02:16:47,400 --> 02:16:48,260
'Today is Sunday.'

1703
02:16:50,200 --> 02:16:52,760
'Let it be. How does it bother me?'

1704
02:16:56,240 --> 02:16:57,422
'It is about to be 10 O'clock.'

1705
02:16:58,540 --> 02:16:59,760
'Let it be. How does it bother me?'

1706
02:17:41,620 --> 02:17:44,900
''The anklet-bell rang.
The heart skipped a beat.''

1707
02:17:46,640 --> 02:17:50,932
''The cloud stormed.
There is a buzz in the village.''

1708
02:17:56,440 --> 02:18:01,040
''Who colored the parrot green?''

1709
02:18:01,620 --> 02:18:05,980
''Who taught the peacock to dance?''

1710
02:18:06,460 --> 02:18:10,980
''The anklet-bell rang.
The heart sklipped a beat.''

1711
02:18:11,560 --> 02:18:15,900
''The cloud stormed.
There is a buzz in the village.''

1712
02:18:46,820 --> 02:18:51,260
''A nightingale sang
the auspicious song.''

1713
02:18:51,660 --> 02:18:56,280
''The jasmine bud
wants to win your heart.''

1714
02:18:56,700 --> 02:18:59,667
''It is becoming hard to resist you.''

1715
02:19:01,520 --> 02:19:04,191
''Do not entice me.''

1716
02:19:06,680 --> 02:19:10,740
''What did the pearl on the Lotus say?''

1717
02:19:11,800 --> 02:19:15,992
''It wants to reach your nose-ring.''

1718
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:19,240
''On the beautiful cheek..''

1719
02:19:20,380 --> 02:19:21,700
''..there is Little blush.''

1720
02:19:23,040 --> 02:19:26,040
''Come to me and tie
me the green chain.''

1721
02:19:26,820 --> 02:19:30,960
''The anklet-bell rang.
The heart skipped a beat.''

1722

''The cloud stormed.
There is a buzz in the village.''

1723
02:20:13,240 --> 02:20:16,500
''O Greek God,
you have no competition.''

1724
02:20:17,040 --> 02:20:21,460
''O my beautiful star,
you have got the greatest shine.''

1725
02:20:21,980 --> 02:20:24,699
''Your step will crush the floor.''

1726
02:20:26,960 --> 02:20:29,872
''No other lady can have
this affect on my heart.''

1727
02:20:31,840 --> 02:20:35,888
''In our village you will be
greeted by a folk song.''

1728
02:20:36,800 --> 02:20:41,000
''If it is a folk song
I would hear it from my heart.''

1729
02:20:43,120 --> 02:20:44,352
''Under the shadow of a papal tree..''

1730
02:20:45,700 --> 02:20:46,884
''We shall have a maize roti.''

1731
02:20:48,160 --> 02:20:51,300
''It would be great
to have it in your company.''

1732
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:56,000
''The anklet-bell rang.
The heart skipped a beat.''

1733
02:20:57,000 --> 02:21:01,272
''The cloud stormed.
There is a buzz in the village.''

1734
02:21:30,360 --> 02:21:31,560
Anita. Anita.
- Please, Siddhu.

1735
02:21:31,962 --> 02:21:34,092
Anita. Anita.
- Siddhu. Siddhu. Please.

1736
02:21:36,260 --> 02:21:37,120
Anita. Anita. Anita.

1737
02:21:43,200 --> 02:21:45,260
Siddhu. Siddhu. Siddhu. Siddhu,
please. Siddhu.

1738
02:21:45,560 --> 02:21:46,060
Siddhu.

1739
02:21:53,160 --> 02:21:53,660
Siddhu.

1740
02:22:22,380 --> 02:22:22,880
Hello!

1741
02:22:27,380 --> 02:22:27,880
O God!

1742
02:22:31,880 --> 02:22:33,980
Who is this? Why are you
mum after calling me?

1743
02:22:34,660 --> 02:22:35,843
Hello!
- Siddhu.

1744
02:22:36,920 --> 02:22:38,194
Anita. Anita.

1745
02:22:42,200 --> 02:22:43,780
Oh God! Anita. Anita.

1746
02:22:47,440 --> 02:22:49,400
Anita, stop it. Anita, please.

1747
02:22:55,400 --> 02:22:57,580
Siddhu, stop it.

1748
02:22:59,080 --> 02:23:00,940
Anita, I can it take this.
Stop it please.

1749
02:23:27,420 --> 02:23:30,420
Sorry, I am late.
- No problem. What did Shanti say?

1750
02:23:30,860 --> 02:23:32,560
She asked to forget it.
- Forget what?

1751
02:23:33,080 --> 02:23:34,520
Love.
- Whose Love?

1752
02:23:36,060 --> 02:23:39,100
Shanti told Babu
to forget his Love for her.

1753
02:23:41,600 --> 02:23:42,580
I see.
And what did you say then?

1754
02:23:42,960 --> 02:23:44,480
What would I say
If she does not want it?

1755
02:23:44,980 --> 02:23:46,180
It is easy for you.
You love when you feel like loving..

1756
02:23:46,220 --> 02:23:48,080
..and you Leave
when you feel like Leaving.

1757
02:23:48,160 --> 02:23:49,000
You do not know
how much it hurts others.

1758
02:23:49,420 --> 02:23:50,680
Why are you talking as if
you are some pure soul?

1759
02:23:51,160 --> 02:23:52,260
You think I do not know
how good you are?

1760
02:23:53,120 --> 02:23:54,152
Did not you breathe yesterday?

1761
02:23:56,280 --> 02:24:01,000
What! Did not I breathe?
- Did not you breathe yesterday?

1762
02:24:01,520 --> 02:24:03,300
Not just yesterday,
but I also breathed..

1763
02:24:03,380 --> 02:24:04,220
..the day before yesterday,
the day before that..

1764
02:24:04,360 --> 02:24:05,340
I have been breathing since
many months and years..

1765
02:24:05,500 --> 02:24:06,480
I have been breathing
slnce childhood.

1766
02:24:06,980 --> 02:24:08,060
You want to say that we
do not have the rights..

1767
02:24:08,360 --> 02:24:09,520
..to breathe as well?

1768
02:24:10,580 --> 02:24:11,932
You asked me
not to look at your waist. Ok.

1769
02:24:12,080 --> 02:24:13,420
Now you are saying that
breathing is also wrong.

1770
02:24:13,900 --> 02:24:15,460
Am I the only one
In this world who breathes?

1771
02:24:15,680 --> 02:24:17,280
Everyone breathes.
Your parents breathe..

1772
02:24:17,420 --> 02:24:19,354
..my parents breathe,
neither you nor l would survive..

1773
02:24:19,480 --> 02:24:21,156
..if we do not breathe.
Even that puppy will not survive.

1774
02:24:21,720 --> 02:24:22,860
It breathes in one way
when it stands..

1775
02:24:22,940 --> 02:24:23,980
It breathes in a different
way when it sits..

1776
02:24:24,100 --> 02:24:25,900
It breathes in a dlfferent
way when it runs.

1777
02:24:27,160 --> 02:24:27,780
Right, puppy?

1778
02:24:29,980 --> 02:24:31,940
Now If we do not breathe
well how would we survive?

1779
02:24:32,240 --> 02:24:32,912
How can you say that it is wrong!

1780
02:24:32,980 --> 02:24:34,040
The breathing I am
talking about is different..

1781
02:24:34,120 --> 02:24:35,940
..from what you are talking about.
- All are same.

1782
02:24:36,060 --> 02:24:37,500
If you say breathing is wrong
then everything's wrong..

1783
02:24:37,740 --> 02:24:38,880
..In this world. - I will leave
if you talk Like that.

1784
02:24:39,180 --> 02:24:41,191
I do not want to talk about it.
- No, you have to talk about it.

1785
02:24:41,300 --> 02:24:42,460
About what?
- About Love and pain.

1786
02:24:43,600 --> 02:24:46,460
How can Shati go back after
writing those lengthy letters?

1787
02:24:46,560 --> 02:24:48,240
That is why we need
to talk about it.

1788
02:24:53,980 --> 02:24:56,300
My dear students, I am upset
our day of separatlon..

1789
02:24:56,640 --> 02:24:59,000
..would arrive so soon.
If you come to me one by one..

1790
02:24:59,340 --> 02:25:01,200
..I will give you a sendoff.
Gita, come.

1791
02:25:03,080 --> 02:25:03,980
Take care, dear.

1792
02:25:04,580 --> 02:25:06,140
Sangeeta, you come here.

1793
02:25:07,400 --> 02:25:08,600
Take care of your health.

1794
02:25:08,780 --> 02:25:10,130
Anupama, come here.

1795
02:25:11,280 --> 02:25:12,840
Take care. Next.

1796
02:25:15,880 --> 02:25:17,300
Get lost.
- Master.

1797
02:25:17,960 --> 02:25:19,720
You are stinking. How long has
It been since you took a bath?

1798
02:25:19,860 --> 02:25:20,420
Get Lost.

1799
02:25:21,280 --> 02:25:24,640
Anita, you are also
Leaving the college?

1800
02:25:24,800 --> 02:25:26,660
You would be breaking
so many hearts.

1801
02:25:26,820 --> 02:25:28,840
And yes, you used to say
'I Love kids' a lot.

1802
02:25:29,140 --> 02:25:32,100
Yes, I love kids a Lot.
- I am always ready..

1803
02:25:32,140 --> 02:25:35,100
..to father those kids.
- Naughty.

1804
02:25:39,640 --> 02:25:41,760
Babu, what is this!
- Siddhu, they fixed Shanti's wedding..

1805
02:25:42,100 --> 02:25:44,380
..on the 27th.
Here is the invitation.

1806
02:25:51,300 --> 02:25:51,900
What shall we do now?

1807
02:25:58,020 --> 02:26:00,000
Uncle, Shanti is
nowhere in the house.

1808
02:26:00,420 --> 02:26:02,140
What! She is nowhere.
- We searched everywhere.

1809
02:26:02,160 --> 02:26:02,995
We could not find her anywhere.

1810
02:26:15,180 --> 02:26:17,560
Babu, Shanti's father is
coming this way with his men.

1811
02:26:18,200 --> 02:26:20,100
I will go and stop them.
- Siddhu, how can the wedding..

1812
02:26:20,385 --> 02:26:21,405
..take place in your absence?

1813
02:26:21,695 --> 02:26:23,069
It is not important
if I am here or not..

1814
02:26:23,233 --> 02:26:24,313
..but the wedding is more important.
- But, Siddhu..

1815
02:26:25,060 --> 02:26:26,840
There is no use talking to you.
Be careful, Babu.

1816
02:26:39,180 --> 02:26:40,980
Bro, what are you doing?
- Eating coconut.

1817
02:26:42,480 --> 02:26:42,980
Come.

1818
02:26:52,460 --> 02:26:53,738
Hey, Chotu Motu, Lift the gate.

1819
02:26:55,540 --> 02:26:57,540
Brother has not given me permission.
Go away.

1820
02:26:58,240 --> 02:27:00,160
Who is your brother?
Lift the gate.

1821
02:27:00,740 --> 02:27:04,760
Who is your brother?
- Brother, they are screaming at me.

1822
02:27:05,660 --> 02:27:09,460
''The fishes in the hand
were jumping out of the hand.''

1823
02:27:09,660 --> 02:27:13,960
''I slashed those fishes
ln two pieces.''

1824
02:27:14,140 --> 02:27:18,140
''I will cook those fishes
for dinner.''

1825
02:27:18,580 --> 02:27:21,920
Hey! - Brother is here.
- What is the matter?

1826
02:27:22,080 --> 02:27:23,380
With those beards and moustaches..

1827
02:27:23,380 --> 02:27:26,300
..you are scaring a kid?
- Hey, you! Do not shatter my mind.

1828
02:27:26,520 --> 02:27:30,460
Open the gate. - Shatter
your mind? You have a mind?

1829
02:27:31,340 --> 02:27:33,920
Hey! I am telling you.
I am telling you.

1830
02:27:34,020 --> 02:27:35,600
If you do not open the gate
I will cut you into pieces..

1831
02:27:35,740 --> 02:27:36,740
..and throw you in the drain.

1832
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:40,120
O brother, your voice is scaring me.

1833
02:27:42,380 --> 02:27:44,940
What is that body and what is
that voice? They do not gel well.

1834
02:27:45,160 --> 02:27:47,120
Go and repair your voice.
Get Lost from here. Next.

1835
02:27:47,620 --> 02:27:50,880
Hey, you!
- What? - Who are you?

1836
02:27:51,980 --> 02:27:53,600
Hey, you do not know brother?

1837
02:27:53,720 --> 02:27:56,080
It is our misfortune, brother.
It is our misfortune.

1838
02:27:56,280 --> 02:27:57,433
We have to give our own
Introductions. Ok, carry on.

1839
02:27:59,560 --> 02:28:00,759
World-renowned poet
Ravindranath Tagore..

1840
02:28:00,960 --> 02:28:02,420
..Jagadish Chandra Bose,
Subash Chandra Bose..

1841
02:28:02,600 --> 02:28:04,080
..Amartya Sen,
Satyajit Ray, Bagha Jatin..

1842
02:28:04,260 --> 02:28:05,500
..Swami Rama Krishna Paramahama..

1843
02:28:05,580 --> 02:28:07,060
..Swami Vivekananda,
Swami Yogananda..

1844
02:28:07,380 --> 02:28:09,780

1845
02:28:09,840 --> 02:28:11,900
..Royal Bengal Tiger
Siddhu Siddhartha Roy.

1846
02:28:12,700 --> 02:28:14,020
We are all from 'Amar Bangla'.

1847
02:28:14,920 --> 02:28:16,860
That is why I tell you my friends,
get lost from here.

1848
02:28:17,120 --> 02:28:17,700
Please.

1849
02:28:19,280 --> 02:28:20,280
Did you get it?

1850
02:28:20,860 --> 02:28:23,880
Hey, you dogs!
You cannot open a gate?

1851
02:28:24,180 --> 02:28:25,900
You are playing games here?
Hit him.

1852
02:28:27,460 --> 02:28:29,660
Hey, let me warn you. If you
listen to me and leave..

1853
02:28:29,720 --> 02:28:31,460
..I will spare you, or else..

1854
02:28:35,140 --> 02:28:37,240
I know Life is taxing
and death is relaxing.

1855
02:28:37,280 --> 02:28:39,967
Let me Liberate your divine souls
from your stinking bodies.

1856
02:29:00,260 --> 02:29:02,620
Salim, get him.
- I will cut his leg.

1857
02:29:05,640 --> 02:29:08,540
Salim, say him with the sword.
Slay him.

1858
02:29:11,060 --> 02:29:12,120
Get him. Get him.

1859
02:29:13,020 --> 02:29:14,620
Wait a minute. I do not get anything.

1860
02:29:33,800 --> 02:29:35,335
I told you to
repair your voice first.

1861
02:29:42,040 --> 02:29:42,920
You did not get it?

1862
02:29:43,860 --> 02:29:46,600
I do not fight people Like you.
You got it now?

1863
02:29:48,600 --> 02:29:49,240
Good boy.

1864
02:29:57,820 --> 02:29:59,482
No. No. No.

1865
02:30:00,140 --> 02:30:01,800
Boss, one minute.

1866
02:30:03,420 --> 02:30:05,840
I have got nothing.
I do not want to fight you.

1867
02:30:06,560 --> 02:30:09,060
You got it?
- Then why did you come here?

1868
02:30:10,020 --> 02:30:11,252
To play marbles?

1869
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:25,040
Hey, I could slash your shirts
and hair without hurting you.

1870
02:30:25,960 --> 02:30:27,704
Taking your Lives
Is not too hard for me.

1871
02:30:28,520 --> 02:30:29,752
But I am not doing
that only because..

1872
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:32,820
..I know the value of Life.
- Are you scared of a kid?

1873
02:30:37,660 --> 02:30:40,300
Hey, you know who I am?
Gudumba Satti. Gudumba Satti.

1874
02:30:44,980 --> 02:30:46,900
You can be Gudumba Satti,
you can be anyone..

1875
02:30:47,080 --> 02:30:49,060
..but I do not care,
because I am Siddhu Siddhartha Roy.

1876
02:31:04,900 --> 02:31:07,540
Now tell me how difficult
it is to kill someone.

1877
02:31:08,540 --> 02:31:09,980
You guys do not know
the value of life.

1878
02:31:10,440 --> 02:31:11,928
By killing people
you might think that you are..

1879
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:13,020
..big shots and Leaders.

1880
02:31:15,240 --> 02:31:17,260
A pistol that was
In your hand a minute ago..

1881
02:31:18,040 --> 02:31:19,848
..is in my hands now.
I could have taken their lives..

1882
02:31:20,680 --> 02:31:21,611
..just like you do,
but I know the value of life.

1883
02:31:22,680 --> 02:31:24,280
Your wealth,
power and influence..

1884
02:31:24,520 --> 02:31:26,280
..might be helpful
to take a person's Life..

1885
02:31:27,060 --> 02:31:28,460
..but they are not enough
to give someone a life.

1886
02:31:29,980 --> 02:31:32,720
Sir, I told you earlier as well
and I am saying it again.

1887
02:31:33,720 --> 02:31:35,140
Babu is not just
an intelligent guy..

1888
02:31:35,560 --> 02:31:36,760
..but he is a
good-hearted person as well.

1889
02:31:37,680 --> 02:31:39,220
If Shanti marries
a person of her choice..

1890
02:31:39,720 --> 02:31:41,060
..there will not be any problem.

1891
02:31:41,600 --> 02:31:44,520
Do not ruin her wedding
with blood and murders.

1892
02:31:48,200 --> 02:31:50,780
Sir, you are an elderly man.
I need not tell you all this.

1893
02:31:52,200 --> 02:31:53,960
When I can do so much
for my friendship..

1894
02:31:54,540 --> 02:31:56,092
..why cannot you do
a little bit for your daughter?

1895
02:31:58,200 --> 02:32:01,040
I said whatever I had to say.
Now it is up to you.

1896
02:32:12,260 --> 02:32:14,708
Before I cross the temple gate
you can kill me..

1897
02:32:14,820 --> 02:32:15,780
..and take her away..

1898
02:32:24,840 --> 02:32:25,340
Hey!

1899
02:32:27,180 --> 02:32:29,640
What is your name?
- Bengal Tiger Siddhartha Roy.

1900
02:32:33,760 --> 02:32:36,260
Siddhu, I liked your guts.

1901
02:32:38,420 --> 02:32:42,020
For your friend, you are even
ready to sacrifice your Life..

1902
02:32:42,820 --> 02:32:44,340
..which shows that he
is a worthy person.

1903
02:32:45,520 --> 02:32:47,340
Siddhu, take me there.

1904
02:32:53,760 --> 02:32:54,880
I need to bless her.

1905
02:32:56,040 --> 02:32:56,540
Buddy.

1906
02:33:02,280 --> 02:33:04,180
Come, brother.
- Welcome, uncle.

1907
02:33:06,240 --> 02:33:07,820
I knew uncle Gudumba,
that you would change.

1908
02:33:07,940 --> 02:33:09,620
Give me that gun. That ugly gun.

1909
02:33:09,722 --> 02:33:11,354
You are a dangerous guy.

1910
02:33:12,300 --> 02:33:14,844
Hey, uncle! Why are
you so hot-tempered!

1911
02:33:15,560 --> 02:33:17,980
I told you earlier as well..

1912
02:33:28,740 --> 02:33:30,600
Babu, do not worry.

1913
02:33:31,060 --> 02:33:32,660
The auspicious time is passing by.
Tie the nuptial thread.

1914
02:33:35,840 --> 02:33:37,380
Pass me few.

1915
02:33:41,940 --> 02:33:43,760
I am so happy for you.

Bye, uncle Gudumba.

1919
02:33:57,500 --> 02:33:59,120
Bye.
- Bye.

1920
02:33:59,380 --> 02:34:01,140
Bye. Bye.

Thanks a Lot for uniting my friend
Babu with his girlfriend.

Thanks to you too.

1925
02:34:22,360 --> 02:34:26,680
You helped me a lot to unite
my friend with her friend.

1926
02:34:31,240 --> 02:34:32,300
Thanks a Lot for that.

1927
02:34:34,860 --> 02:34:35,360

Ok.
- What ok?

1933
02:37:31,600 --> 02:37:33,300
I am Leaving and you are saying ok?

1934
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:35,400
I am already pretty tensed here.

1935
02:37:35,920 --> 02:37:38,020
I am sorry, Madhu.
I will call you Later. Bye. - Bye.

1936

Hi!

Madhu has gone?
- Where has she gone?

1941
02:38:44,860 --> 02:38:46,300
She is going by Gautami Express
from Secundrabad.

1942
02:38:56,180 --> 02:38:57,960
Gautami Express platform no. 3.

1943
02:39:01,440 --> 02:39:03,160
Falaknuma Express platform no. 4.

1944
02:39:53,380 --> 02:39:54,420
Madhu. Madhu. Madhu.

1945
02:39:57,580 --> 02:39:58,560
Siddhu. Siddhu. Siddhu.

1946
02:40:08,060 --> 02:40:09,620
Has anyone called Madhu
come here?

1947
02:40:10,560 --> 02:40:12,272
No one came here till now.

1948
02:40:37,300 --> 02:40:38,180
Siddhu.

1949
02:41:03,400 --> 02:41:05,340
'What if she had gone to
that platform searching me?'

1950
02:41:06,080 --> 02:41:08,440
'Has he gone to
that platform searching me?'

1951
02:41:18,380 --> 02:41:18,880
Ok.

1952
02:41:21,800 --> 02:41:24,740

Sure.

Excuse me.

'What! He is here again?'

1959
02:43:33,260 --> 02:43:33,780
Are you Siddhu?

1960
02:43:35,493 --> 02:43:36,563
Someone Left this for you.

1961
02:43:43,340 --> 02:43:46,740
'Dear, Madhu.
I wanted to say something to you..'

1962
02:43:46,800 --> 02:43:49,860
'..since a Long time, but I could not.
You know what it is.'

1963
02:43:50,080 --> 02:43:52,440
'I Love you, Madhu. I Love you.'

1964
02:43:55,040 --> 02:43:56,168
'But I do not know why..'

1965
02:43:58,400 --> 02:43:59,664
'..I could not say this to you
all these days.'

1966
02:44:00,320 --> 02:44:02,080
'If I cannot say this
to you today..'

1967
02:44:02,720 --> 02:44:05,440
'..I fear I will not be able to say it
to you ever again, Siddhu.'

1968
02:44:06,840 --> 02:44:08,488
'Ever again.
- Today I want to say it to you..'

1969
02:44:09,560 --> 02:44:12,780
'..but you are not with me, Madhu.
You are not with me.'

1970
02:44:17,340 --> 02:44:20,380
'Today I came to know some truth.
You know what it is.'

1971
02:44:21,200 --> 02:44:24,220
'All these days we were not fighting,
but it was love.'

1972
02:44:25,400 --> 02:44:26,480
'I want you, Siddhu.'

1973
02:44:27,220 --> 02:44:30,060
'To Love me, to fight with me.'

1974
02:44:53,520 --> 02:45:01,560
After ten years..

1975
02:45:06,860 --> 02:45:09,260
Stand up. Stand straight.

1976
02:45:12,240 --> 02:45:13,940
Wear it. Come on.

1977
02:45:16,700 --> 02:45:18,640
Listen. Look at him.

1978
02:45:21,760 --> 02:45:23,760
Why are you
troubling me this way? What.

1979
02:45:24,320 --> 02:45:26,560
Listen. Listen.

1980
02:45:28,360 --> 02:45:29,940
Cannot you hear me?
- Yes, I can.

1981
02:45:30,220 --> 02:45:31,020
Listen.
- What!

1982
02:45:31,220 --> 02:45:34,280
Look at this crazy kid.
He is giving me a hard time.

1983
02:45:35,680 --> 02:45:37,795
He took after you.
- What! He took after me?

1984
02:45:38,020 --> 02:45:38,880
He took after me?
Look at her.

1985
02:45:39,020 --> 02:45:40,860
She is not removing her towel.
She took after you.

1986
02:45:41,040 --> 02:45:43,211
What! She took after me?
Say it again.

1987
02:45:43,380 --> 02:45:45,336
I will say it hundred times.
- If you do not like me..

1988
02:45:45,397 --> 02:45:47,241
..why did you marry me
in the first place. - My misfortune.

1989
02:45:47,421 --> 02:45:48,681
Before I reached
my village on train..

1990
02:45:48,778 --> 02:45:50,938
..you reached there by flight
and told my father..

1991
02:45:51,060 --> 02:45:53,776
..that you love me..
- You are screaming like a crow.

1992
02:45:53,900 --> 02:45:56,220
..and begged for
my hand, did not you?

1993
02:45:56,320 --> 02:45:58,640
Here is Miss. Universe.
- That is how you got my hand.

1994
02:45:58,800 --> 02:46:00,560
That is the biggest mistake
of my Life. - Yes.

1995
02:46:00,960 --> 02:46:03,183
In just ten years of marriage
you got me pregnant..

1996
02:46:03,280 --> 02:46:04,520
..so many times..
- Hey, come in.

1997
02:46:04,540 --> 02:46:06,871
I am pregnant even now.
And now you say it was a mistake?

1998
02:46:07,080 --> 02:46:08,040
Why are not you saying anything?

1999
02:46:08,560 --> 02:46:10,580
Hey, what rubbish are you
talking since then? - Mistake..

2000
02:46:10,820 --> 02:46:12,600
Stop it. Stop it. Enough.

2001
02:46:13,420 --> 02:46:15,060
It is your mistake.
- I have been bearing you..

2002
02:46:15,300 --> 02:46:16,620
..since many years.
You never keep your mouth shut.

2003
02:46:16,800 --> 02:46:18,860

when we were in college..

..we used to fight a Lot..
Daily fights..

2013
02:46:44,447 --> 02:46:47,687

destiny brought us together.

02:46:48,960 --> 02:46:50,340
And then we did not Look back.

2015
02:46:50,540 --> 02:46:51,940
Every time it was
a double impact.

There are so many.
I just get confused sometimes.

2030
02:47:29,140 --> 02:47:31,460
