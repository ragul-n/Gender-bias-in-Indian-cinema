1
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:49,128
Whether you meet or separate

2
00:02:50,236 --> 00:02:52,295
Who the hell cares about your story?

3
00:02:58,111 --> 00:02:59,840
Everyone just walks by you

4
00:03:00,046 --> 00:03:01,536
NNo wonder the world has
come to a standstill

5
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,342
Let silence speak, then

6
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:16,286
Let's wander into forests of dreams.
To find out if spring has arrived

7
00:03:17,096 --> 00:03:18,586
It's the age to sleep, the age to dream

8
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:20,798
For just a moment or two actually

9
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,267
Everyone just walks by you

10
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:24,868
NNo wonder your world has
come to a standstill

11
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:38,415
NNawab sir, everyone's waiting
for you at the publishing house

12
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:41,746
The publisher, the press.
I've come to fetch you

13
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:42,887
I'll be there right away

14
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:47,250
NNagma, please fetch my sherwani

15
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:48,822
I am bringing.

16
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:50,887
But where are you going brother?

17
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:53,395
I'll tell you later.
Give my sherwani

18
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,724
Don't you remember
what's happening today?

19
00:03:55,935 --> 00:03:57,562
Yes, yes I remember?
What do you remember?

20
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:58,498
You tell me

21
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:00,832
It happens to be my mehndi,
my engagement ceremony today

22
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,203
Of course, I remember it's my
dear sister's mehndi today

23
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,002
There will be a grand
qawwali performance

24
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:10,842
Delicacies conjured up by our
dearest aunt will be served today

25
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:12,779
but how did you remember
that I must have forgotten?

26
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:16,353
Because you don't remember anything
but your stories and books

27
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:18,888
Awww come on, I remember everything

28
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,826
I'll be back pronto
Pronto

29
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:27,795
Ladies and gentlemen, before addressing
every gathering, everyone says,

30
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:30,926
There is no need for me to speak
Without standing on ceremony,

31
00:04:31,537 --> 00:04:37,737
let me welcome all of you
lovers of NNawab's books

32
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:41,413
The name NNawab is made up of a
few letters of the alphabet

33
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:44,777
but this small name is recognised
and acclaimed all over,

34
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:47,248
NNawab has become a household name

35
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,411
We have gathered here today
not to release his new book

36
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:53,851
but to announce that he is
beginning a new novel

37
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,291
Gentlemen, photographs later please.

38
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:56,462
he has been inspired
by a certain idea

39
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:59,722
here's our beloved NNawab,
the master of penmanship,

40
00:04:59,932 --> 00:05:00,864
the pride of the country,

41
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:02,625
the pride of hyderabad, the finest
novelist of the nation

42
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:07,468
Dear friends, my apologies
for my late arrival

43
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:18,377
I don't know what yarn my publisher
friend has spun in my absence

44
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:21,750
Obviously, it must have
been an interesting yarn

45
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:24,546
In fact, I'm afraid that after
publishing so many novels,

46
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:25,985
he may become an author some day

47
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:28,625
NNot to worry, I'll still
remain your friend

48
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:34,290
Friends, I stand before an
enlightened gathering today,

49
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:42,404
those who read, see, hear, find faults

50
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:43,870
You're afraid of the sharp
pens of us critics

51
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:45,908
even before writing your next novel

52
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:48,512
When will you complete it?

53
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:53,048
It's a story that can never be completed

54
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:54,845
When will you start on the novel?

55
00:05:55,688 --> 00:06:03,220
I'm aware this question is being
asked since the last 5 years

56
00:06:04,063 --> 00:06:07,726
But my story isn't to
be blamed for the delay

57
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:11,364
The delay's because of my main
character, an unusual woman

58
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:20,479
While writing... my mind has been
cluttered with questions

59
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:21,780
So I thought to myself

60
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:28,045
why don't I ask the woman to give
me a new twist to her story

61
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:32,988
Today my story has come to such a stage

62
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,622
that the woman has become a riddle

63
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:40,692
NNawab sahib, a woman has always
been a riddle for men, a mystery

64
00:06:43,202 --> 00:06:49,072
But the woman of my story is a
solitary point of reference

65
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:51,338
She doesn't want to come to a
standstill like the rest of world

66
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:56,639
So tell me my friends,
how can I ever end my story?

67
00:06:57,784 --> 00:07:00,309
Keep writing chapter after chapter
of your incomplete story then

68
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:02,986
The publisher is your friend.
he'll keep publishing the chapters

69
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:06,222
After all there isn't a dearth of readers

70
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:08,389
never mind the hullabaloo over
the advance of the electronic media

71
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:15,433
Meenaxi... Meenaxi...

72
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:20,038
hey have you seen Meenaxi?
Find her yourselves

73
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:23,064
There she is... boo to
you... we've found her

74
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,937
Is everything ready for
the mehndi ceremony?

75
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:27,646
Where's everyone disappeared.
Where is Khaajabi?

76
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:30,213
Begum sahiba, I was organising
NNagma baby's clothes

77
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:33,681
This NNagma baby is strange
exactly like her brother

78
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:35,513
Just look at NNawab's room

79
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:40,120
Sheets of paper are strewn like
children's kites all over his room

80
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:46,060
Where on earth's NNagma? Oh here
you are, are you ready, my child?

81
00:07:46,265 --> 00:07:49,723
Absolutely. Aunty how do I look?
Praise be Allah

82
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:51,301
You're glowing like the moon

83
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,137
Where is your brother?

84
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:57,033
how can he disappear
on such an occasion?

85
00:07:57,276 --> 00:07:58,743
Guests are arriving

86
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:00,636
What's the use of complaining
about brother dear?

87
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:02,974
he doesn't care about anyone or himself

88
00:08:03,182 --> 00:08:06,549
he doesn't have time to eat
or dress properly. he merely

89
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:07,650
What're you chattering about?

90
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:10,755
That books are your
only faith, your life

91
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:14,958
NNawab, how could you disappear today?

92
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:18,062
There's so much to do in the house
so many guests are already here

93
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:19,662
Aunt, everything is clockwork

94
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:22,027
henna will be applied on my sister's
hands, the qawwals will sing and

95
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:25,102
we will eat the delicious
yogurt curry cooked by you

96
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:26,931
and pumpkin kheer

97
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:29,004
...and fig.
Dessert!

98
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:31,069
Today you'll feast

99
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:35,206
but what'll you do when your sister
goes to her husband's house?

100
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:36,377
I've tried to make you understand
a thousand times that

101
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:37,276
you should get married

102
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:41,920
This house needs a woman...
but you never listen to me

103
00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:41,740
All around all around

104
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:44,576
Light divine light divine

105
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:47,753
Light supreme light sublime

106
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:56,255
Flash dash light stabs the darkness

107
00:09:56,495 --> 00:10:02,161
Like a bolt of lightning stabs a black sky

108
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:05,132
Beauty you are in the heart,
body and soul

109
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:10,799
Your radiance is ravishing
your mood sensual

110
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:35,732
Light only you know the answer
of what is divine

111
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:41,738
I question darkness
and it turns silent

112
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:47,576
I question brightness and
it is embarrassed

113
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:59,514
I question the bird and
it says to fly is divine

114
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:05,161
I question silence and it says
to hear is divine

115
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:09,926
I question the flowers,
the leaves, the colours,

116
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:13,833
still no answer just rustles and cries

117
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:21,579
All around all around

118
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:15,563
I lifted the veil
and saw your magnificence

119
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:21,333
I went a step forward
to reach your destination

120
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:27,244
I raised an eye and saw your face

121
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:35,950
in the humhumhum of a moth

122
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:38,988
in the khankhankhan of a hand bracelet

123
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:44,725
in the mind and body of a lover
in the lasting gaze of separation

124
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,694
in the cadences of melodies

125
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:53,361
You are there only you

126
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:56,503
Light supreme light sublime

127
00:12:56,709 --> 00:13:02,375
Light divine light divine

128
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:05,550
light supreme light sublime

129
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:42,879
Why're you beating him up?

130
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:43,884
Go to hell!

131
00:13:45,024 --> 00:13:45,854
Strange brute.

132
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:30,464
hmm, the scent of jasmine

133
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:36,833
Oh it's you...
what brings you here?

134
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:40,242
Why don't you ever close the door?

135
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:45,008
But who are you?
My name's Meenaxi

136
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:49,450
I've read all your books

137
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:51,520
I remember every word of every story I see

138
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:56,787
NNow I'm looking for something.
I need your help

139
00:14:57,529 --> 00:14:59,895
Alright. Why're you standing? Take a seat

140
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:11,576
Why is the house silent?
Do you live alone?

141
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:16,341
Yes. My kid sister NNagma was with me

142
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:18,015
She got married recently, she's gone

143
00:15:18,984 --> 00:15:21,578
Our mother died when we were kids

144
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:25,616
we went over to our aunt's
She brought us up

145
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:30,657
When NNagma grew up we returned
to our ancestral home

146
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:34,827
NNagma would look after the house.
I miss her

147
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:42,941
hey there's no need to get emotional

148
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:44,439
After all life is a game played
on us by somebody up there

149
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:51,481
Life must go on. I can get by...
I'm lost in my world of words

150
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:55,713
NNever mind. Tell me
what brings you here?

151
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:56,884
Who are you?

152
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:03,223
I sell perfume

153
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:08,327
Perfume huh? Mercifully
you don't sell dreams

154
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:12,466
But I've come to make you write dreams

155
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:17,406
I've heard you're working on a new novel

156
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:20,802
That's right

157
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:24,482
This time I want to write
something different,

158
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:25,547
away from the rut

159
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:35,554
Perhaps I can help you how?

160
00:16:36,895 --> 00:16:39,830
By asking you to write a novel about me

161
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:43,329
About you? I don't know you at all

162
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:48,999
Look, it's very easy to write
stories about imaginary characters

163
00:16:49,641 --> 00:16:51,233
But it's very difficult to

164
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:54,173
write a book on someone who's real,
alive and breathing

165
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:57,341
Pooh. I'll tell you all
about myself and

166
00:16:57,716 --> 00:17:01,846
if there's something missing,
you can fill in the blanks

167
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:06,115
it doesn't have to be
the absolute truth

168
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:09,427
Stories can't be made of
halftruths, halflies

169
00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:13,028
Stories need something more

170
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:18,030
Forget those essential
ingredients for a novel

171
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:22,203
You can start a story
with just a face

172
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:26,711
with just a feeling

173
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:35,581
and at times, with just
the scent of flowers

174
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:01,269
Why's my lady hiccuping away today?

175
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:12,480
hmmm, the garage Babajee recommended

176
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:16,361
Oh god! Shit.

177
00:18:17,896 --> 00:18:20,990
It's silent everywhere.

178
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,130
It's going to rain, let me sit inside.

179
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:29,304
Let me sit here for some time.

180
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,717
Ok let me play this.

181
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:58,636
What're you doing mister?

182
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:00,236
Quit showing off you're hotblooded

183
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:02,633
Leave me, attend to milady.
Milady? Which milady?

184
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:04,866
The one standing hiccuping there

185
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:07,011
Just see which part of her is hurting

186
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:18,250
You're that famous writer, aren't you?

187
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:20,391
Famous no. Writer yes

188
00:19:27,132 --> 00:19:29,293
Mister, you aren't
what you appear to be

189
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,369
how do you know who I am?

190
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:35,864
Don't fret, I'll stop your
lady's hiccups

191
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:42,878
Your name? What's in a name?

192
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:47,382
See that poster. My name
could have been on it

193
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:52,880
I'm whiling away time
to forget my sorrows

194
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:56,686
Mister this flute in your hand,
the humming in the car's bonnet

195
00:19:57,596 --> 00:19:58,620
you seem to be someone else

196
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:01,329
I'm just fond of singing

197
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:07,034
hmmm, interesting. Tell me a bit
more about yourself

198
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:11,237
Why you ass hole? Will you
write a book on me or what?

199
00:20:12,277 --> 00:20:13,505
I couldn't become a singer... damn it

200
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:16,506
I don't want to be the hero of your story

201
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,514
And then what does the poet say...

202
00:20:24,122 --> 00:20:28,491
Scents will blossom in your gaze

203
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:32,858
We will walk on by
to meet ourselves

204
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:37,362
Our destination is
just two footsteps away

205
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:39,364
Everyone's walking
on by which is why

206
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:41,505
The world is at a standstill today

207
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:53,080
heavens, no work done. And she's back

208
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:56,781
What're you writing, sir?

209
00:20:57,856 --> 00:21:00,381
have you written anything
or are you just wasting away?

210
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:10,326
What brings you here?
There's plenty going on

211
00:21:10,969 --> 00:21:12,231
I've written something in my mind.

212
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:14,536
More is to be written.

213
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:22,376
But right now my mind is closed.
I can't write.

214
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:27,180
Still I've accepted your challenge.

215
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,812
I will surely write your story.
Oh really?

216
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:33,254
On one condition.

217
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:34,924
Condition? Yes

218
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:40,621
What's the condition?
I want complete freedom

219
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:44,802
There is no need to distort
my story any which way

220
00:21:45,904 --> 00:21:49,101
There will be no intervention,
my pen will be free

221
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:53,140
Do you agree?
I agree

222
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:54,973
Listen. Yes

223
00:21:55,947 --> 00:22:04,787
There's a boy called... Kunal
no Karan... no, no,

224
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:08,382
he's called Kameshwar actually.
Kameshwar sounds appropriate

225
00:22:08,593 --> 00:22:12,791
Very oldfashioned, no?

226
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:20,169
Will you let my story proceed?

227
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:21,832
Don't get antsy. Tell me.
Are you stuck on the name?

228
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:22,768
NNo, no, tell me.

229
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:28,337
So Kameshwar is walking
down the road.

230
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:30,079
It's evening.

231
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:34,351
The day's exhausted,
it's come to a halt.

232
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:41,721
Give me your hand, give me
your hand dear life.

233
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:49,190
Walk along with me.

234
00:22:51,903 --> 00:23:05,306
Walk along with me forever.

235
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,381
Where does this road go to?

236
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:24,329
This road is standing here
you have to go somewhere.

237
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:26,863
The road doesn't have to go anywhere.

238
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:44,181
So what if we have
to take two more steps?

239
00:23:53,865 --> 00:24:05,606
Quick quick, get inside.
I... I... got here first.

240
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:10,111
We came here first.
Says who?

241
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:18,012
Let there be colour.

242
00:25:18,216 --> 00:25:22,414
Let's celebrate the splendour of colours.

243
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:04,155
Let there be colour

244
00:26:04,362 --> 00:26:06,557
Let's celebrate
the splendour of colours

245
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:14,297
Colours are dance

246
00:26:14,706 --> 00:26:22,670
Colours are the flame of living
Colours are the dance of living

247
00:27:02,487 --> 00:27:06,116
Colours are us Colours of romance.
Colours of love, colours of union

248
00:27:06,424 --> 00:27:08,449
Colours inspire a song

249
00:27:08,827 --> 00:27:11,227
Colours inspire a story, a language

250
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:26,407
Colours reflect the shades
and hues of life

251
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:30,479
Let's wash ourselves
in the font of love

252
00:27:30,782 --> 00:27:38,484
Let's learn of love
from the tide of colours

253
00:28:46,424 --> 00:28:58,131
Let's listen to the sound of colours.

254
00:28:58,336 --> 00:29:02,170
Monsoon arrives on the
anklets of colour.

255
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:06,138
Every colour exudes a scent.

256
00:29:06,444 --> 00:29:10,039
Every drop dances to the
rhythm of colours.

257
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:18,485
The heart dances too
to the rhythm of colours.

258
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:22,521
Let there be colour.

259
00:29:22,727 --> 00:29:30,600
Let's celebrate the
splendour of colours.

260
00:29:30,802 --> 00:29:38,834
Let's celebrate the
pageant of colours.

261
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,702
Kaanji, where's Kameshwar baba?

262
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:14,601
he hasn't come yet.

263
00:30:14,846 --> 00:30:15,642
What do you mean?

264
00:30:15,847 --> 00:30:17,644
You must have reaches
the railway station late.

265
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:19,882
I reached well in time. Then?

266
00:30:20,251 --> 00:30:22,719
Errr... baba... err.

267
00:30:22,921 --> 00:30:28,621
What... go on, say something
...of Kameshwar.

268
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:33,722
Aunt if I don't tease you,
whom else can I tease?

269
00:30:33,932 --> 00:30:36,332
Go on, I don't mind

270
00:30:37,035 --> 00:30:39,026
You were frightened, weren't you?

271
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:42,001
Alright child, I did get
frightened. happy?

272
00:30:43,441 --> 00:30:46,569
Kanji, take baba's bags inside

273
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:52,776
Tell me my dear, how was the journey?

274
00:30:52,984 --> 00:30:53,712
Terrific

275
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:57,786
Such a long journey and
that too, by train

276
00:30:57,989 --> 00:31:01,425
You're as stubborn as your mother

277
00:31:01,626 --> 00:31:03,059
If you had informed me earlier...

278
00:31:03,261 --> 00:31:06,662
I would have asked the maharaja to send
his private airplane for you

279
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:07,524
Yeah right

280
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:36,111
Long time no see, your lordship.
Were you hanging out in London?

281
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:41,156
NNo way. London and Europe
are your husband's domain

282
00:32:41,392 --> 00:32:43,690
he travels to and fro as if he
were travelling by local bus

283
00:32:45,229 --> 00:32:49,632
Maharaj, I have to travel purely for
business, no pleasure...

284
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:52,566
Where's Kameshwar?

285
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:56,797
he'll be here. he's freshly
hyderabadreturned

286
00:32:57,008 --> 00:32:57,975
he won't present himself

287
00:32:58,176 --> 00:32:59,973
before his elders without
wearing his long coat

288
00:33:00,345 --> 00:33:05,476
he's very shy... oh young man
come, come join us

289
00:33:06,017 --> 00:33:06,813
Salaam

290
00:33:09,354 --> 00:33:10,480
Young man,

291
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:12,986
meet Maharaja Vijendra Singh

292
00:33:13,691 --> 00:33:15,989
We used to study together at Oxford.
Great

293
00:33:17,695 --> 00:33:19,322
There's a problem.
What problem?

294
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:22,328
I don't know how to introduce my
nephew to you. Why?

295
00:33:22,533 --> 00:33:24,330
Because I'll end up
flattering him silly

296
00:33:26,137 --> 00:33:29,504
Then use your typical
British understatement,

297
00:33:29,707 --> 00:33:31,504
"he's not a bad guy"

298
00:33:32,543 --> 00:33:38,004
Seems as if they were right
in lavishing praise on you

299
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:42,678
I'm hosting a party
the day after tomorrow

300
00:33:43,054 --> 00:33:45,022
You must be there. Certainly

301
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:45,951
We'll be there too

302
00:33:46,157 --> 00:33:48,182
You guys don't need a formal invitation.
Do come along

303
00:33:48,893 --> 00:33:52,852
We'll be there

304
00:34:03,241 --> 00:34:05,709
NNonsense. Maya you don't know
what you're saying

305
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:08,345
You know I'm respected here

306
00:34:09,147 --> 00:34:10,375
Let's go from here

307
00:34:10,848 --> 00:34:13,214
One day you'll humiliate me in public

308
00:34:13,584 --> 00:34:14,380
Who are they?

309
00:34:14,752 --> 00:34:16,549
They think they're too much

310
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:21,058
I can see that. But who are they?

311
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:24,888
he's a hotshot bureaucrat.
Collector Karanvir

312
00:34:25,096 --> 00:34:26,563
he throws his weight around

313
00:34:27,432 --> 00:34:28,558
he's terribly illmannered

314
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:57,353
Chameli, my petal!
You said something?

315
00:35:01,365 --> 00:35:01,922
NNo my riddle diddle

316
00:35:19,317 --> 00:35:21,285
Any kite flying today? Of course

317
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:23,181
Those who can't see by
day fly kites at night

318
00:35:24,555 --> 00:35:26,113
At least they can try to. Absolutely

319
00:35:30,995 --> 00:35:32,394
Forget it. It's okay

320
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:36,464
You look lost young man

321
00:35:41,506 --> 00:35:43,974
Go ahead... take care

322
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:47,341
Where is she? She was here only.

323
00:35:55,753 --> 00:35:59,484
Traditionally we greet guests
with a glass of water

324
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:04,988
Absurd! We should give them
water only if they're thirsty

325
00:36:05,196 --> 00:36:07,494
how can you insult tradition?

326
00:36:10,201 --> 00:36:12,829
There's such a shortage of water.
Less water wasted, the better

327
00:36:13,371 --> 00:36:17,171
Water should be conserved
for emergencies

328
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:19,172
Things are conserved
only for emergencies

329
00:36:21,379 --> 00:36:24,348
It seems your life's
pretty complicated

330
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:27,010
The complications
have just begun

331
00:36:28,886 --> 00:36:30,513
Up to you to straighten them out

332
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:35,689
Till then have a cool drink

333
00:36:44,235 --> 00:36:45,202
he's my nephew...

334
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:49,369
and Meenaxi is the dear,
dear niece of the maharaja

335
00:37:03,921 --> 00:37:06,048
Karan, you're so late

336
00:37:06,924 --> 00:37:12,556
I had some work.
You're looking lovely tonight

337
00:37:13,264 --> 00:37:15,391
Aah, you could teach fools
the art of flattery

338
00:37:16,601 --> 00:37:17,727
You haven't brought Maya with you?

339
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:23,570
Where's the maharaja?
Follow me

340
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,738
Meenaxi, what's the buzz
on your savewater campaign?

341
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:33,746
We're going great guns

342
00:37:33,951 --> 00:37:36,078
Gradually village folk are
understanding our point of view

343
00:37:37,622 --> 00:37:40,420
Anyway it's far easier to make
the villagers understand

344
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:42,425
than the city slickers

345
00:37:43,961 --> 00:37:48,091
Miss Midnight Blue, do give me
the address of some village

346
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:52,091
where I can stay and
you can come there

347
00:37:52,303 --> 00:37:53,770
to make a naive fellow
like me understand

348
00:37:54,305 --> 00:37:58,765
Superb! Continue with your
conversation, I'll be back

349
00:38:02,647 --> 00:38:05,946
Are all of you hyderabadis so careless?

350
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:10,109
Are all of you from
Jaisalmer cloaked in mystery?

351
00:38:11,822 --> 00:38:13,790
I can't speak for others

352
00:38:14,492 --> 00:38:18,451
but you'll have to work harder to get to know me

353
00:38:25,503 --> 00:38:27,471
With your permission I'll leave

354
00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:29,499
What if I ask you to stay?

355
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:30,963
Then I'll stay

356
00:39:11,549 --> 00:39:15,178
The biryani I cooked has more taste...
and strength than your Kameshwar

357
00:39:15,386 --> 00:39:16,182
Do you understand?

358
00:39:18,222 --> 00:39:22,022
I'd warned you not to poke your nose in my story

359
00:39:23,728 --> 00:39:25,195
NNow you're making
a joke of my characters

360
00:39:31,068 --> 00:39:34,037
The biryani's delicious.
Your hands have magic

361
00:39:34,238 --> 00:39:35,034
The biryani's fantastic...

362
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:37,207
but when will you write
a fantastic story?

363
00:39:39,744 --> 00:39:40,540
Again you're being sarcastic

364
00:39:40,911 --> 00:39:43,379
NNo, not really. have some more biryani

365
00:39:43,581 --> 00:39:45,048
NNo way. It's cooked in pure oil

366
00:39:45,249 --> 00:39:49,879
I'm stuffed. My stomach may
explode any minute

367
00:39:50,755 --> 00:39:52,552
my stomach is full but not my appetite

368
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:00,397
What's the time?

369
00:40:01,432 --> 00:40:03,730
Why're you so restless?

370
00:40:04,268 --> 00:40:08,227
I was so entranced
by your biryani that...

371
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:10,737
I'd forgotten that my
aunt has sent for me. Aunty?

372
00:40:11,442 --> 00:40:12,409
I have to leave immediately

373
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:15,078
her anger's lethal,

374
00:40:15,279 --> 00:40:17,907
it lasts for several days.
have you eaten?

375
00:40:18,616 --> 00:40:22,382
You can eat later.
Come with me to aunt's

376
00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:25,455
When will you complete my story?

377
00:40:25,623 --> 00:40:28,751
Take it easy, I'll finish
your story for sure

378
00:40:28,959 --> 00:40:30,426
You get impatient so easily

379
00:40:31,462 --> 00:40:34,090
I don't mean to be that way.
But frankly

380
00:40:34,298 --> 00:40:37,927
I can't be patient with
anything that's connected to me

381
00:40:38,135 --> 00:40:44,096
What should I do? I don't want
to participate in the story

382
00:40:44,708 --> 00:40:47,609
I want to read, feel & understand
the story while I'm still alive

383
00:40:47,812 --> 00:40:48,938
But... but...

384
00:40:49,146 --> 00:40:53,606
the writer in you just doesn't even
want to try and understand me

385
00:40:53,818 --> 00:40:54,614
I feel helpless

386
00:40:55,986 --> 00:41:01,947
I want to experience
a different relationship

387
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:02,955
through the medium of the story

388
00:41:04,995 --> 00:41:08,795
What kind of relationship?
I hope you understand

389
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:10,292
I understand everything

390
00:41:11,502 --> 00:41:15,962
You can't possibly understand the kind of
characters... who're in my imagination

391
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:18,808
NNow look, aunt is all
ready to vent her anger on me

392
00:41:19,343 --> 00:41:22,972
I'm trying to grasp
time in my hands

393
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:24,477
Once I've fielded the catch,

394
00:41:24,682 --> 00:41:25,649
I'll do every little thing on
the dot of time

395
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:27,647
NNow stop spinning yarns

396
00:41:27,852 --> 00:41:29,820
honestly I'm not spinning yarns

397
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:33,649
See, NNagma's friend Meenaxi
is here with me

398
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:37,316
Who's NNagma's friend Meenaxi?
Where is she?

399
00:41:37,528 --> 00:41:38,995
She's with me. You're talking drivel

400
00:41:39,196 --> 00:41:40,993
Begum sahiba, the biryani's turning cold

401
00:41:41,198 --> 00:41:43,666
Cold! Come inside immediately

402
00:41:44,034 --> 00:41:44,659
Oh no, more biryani

403
00:41:45,035 --> 00:41:48,163
You're behaving as if it's some
crocodile instead of biryani

404
00:41:49,373 --> 00:41:50,840
What're you looking for?
Come. I was looking for

405
00:41:51,041 --> 00:41:52,338
Looking for what?
The biryani's inside

406
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:47,761
Why are you coming after me? Get lost.

407
00:43:03,948 --> 00:43:05,074
Sir you were stalking me

408
00:43:05,449 --> 00:43:07,747
NNo I wasn't.
You were

409
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:36,705
Take it.

410
00:43:39,483 --> 00:43:41,110
What're you up to?

411
00:43:41,986 --> 00:43:44,454
how could you disappear from aunt's
house as if you don't know me at all

412
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:48,788
Look if I'd come there,

413
00:43:48,993 --> 00:43:53,623
you would have tried to find out
something about Meenaxi from me

414
00:43:54,331 --> 00:43:56,128
NNot at all. I know everything

415
00:43:57,334 --> 00:43:58,801
What do you know, NNawab?

416
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:02,798
You've been writing the same
book for the last three months,

417
00:44:03,841 --> 00:44:05,468
it hasn't even taken off yet

418
00:44:05,843 --> 00:44:08,971
Your poor, helpless characters
are still struggling to know...

419
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:10,908
the reason for their existence

420
00:44:11,115 --> 00:44:12,980
I know the reason for their
existence very well

421
00:44:13,851 --> 00:44:16,877
I'm trying to bring them
to life in new colours

422
00:44:17,121 --> 00:44:18,986
you won't be able to
understand that

423
00:44:20,224 --> 00:44:21,020
I understand everything

424
00:44:25,029 --> 00:44:29,159
I know you can give
everything to Meenaxi.

425
00:44:29,366 --> 00:44:33,029
It's my search that you must understand
Look at me

426
00:44:34,204 --> 00:44:37,605
Do you find something lacking in me?

427
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:40,810
I'm beautiful... right?

428
00:44:41,278 --> 00:44:44,247
Look into my eyes

429
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:51,082
can you paint them in any other colour?

430
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:57,190
What else can I say or do for you?

431
00:45:09,907 --> 00:45:12,876
We have met, there's a distance.

432
00:45:14,078 --> 00:45:16,808
Perhaps love means distance.

433
00:45:18,248 --> 00:45:21,376
We meet, we separate

434
00:45:23,087 --> 00:45:25,055
Our story remains incomplete

435
00:45:25,255 --> 00:45:27,553
If only you were here

436
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,888
Without you the moon is half
even on a full moon night.

437
00:45:34,765 --> 00:45:36,824
I can see you by touching you

438
00:45:37,768 --> 00:45:39,963
We are separated merely by a lifetime

439
00:45:41,105 --> 00:45:43,073
Separation is a must

440
00:45:44,108 --> 00:45:46,303
Or else how would
we feel the pain of love?

441
00:45:52,449 --> 00:45:55,418
What're you doing here?

442
00:45:55,953 --> 00:45:57,181
Exactly my question

443
00:45:57,955 --> 00:45:59,320
First you tell me why you're here

444
00:46:02,126 --> 00:46:07,120
First you, why are you here?

445
00:46:07,297 --> 00:46:08,559
I'm looking for a face

446
00:46:10,634 --> 00:46:12,602
What kind of face?
A beautiful face

447
00:46:14,471 --> 00:46:17,531
NNo shortage of beauty here

448
00:46:19,143 --> 00:46:20,667
Yes but

449
00:46:21,311 --> 00:46:27,341
NNow I suppose you want to say
my face is imprinted in your eyes

450
00:46:29,486 --> 00:46:30,350
I didn't say that.

451
00:46:32,322 --> 00:46:33,619
Your eyes are saying that

452
00:46:34,658 --> 00:46:38,116
Eye say!
You can read eyes, can you?

453
00:46:40,164 --> 00:46:44,123
Yes if there's something
written in the eyes

454
00:46:45,002 --> 00:46:47,493
I can read and write you know

455
00:46:48,505 --> 00:46:51,133
how educated are you?
how many languages can you speak?

456
00:46:54,011 --> 00:46:58,141
I can speak the language of
women which can silence men

457
00:47:02,853 --> 00:47:04,582
You can't cast your spell on me

458
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:07,486
We've just met

459
00:47:08,525 --> 00:47:10,049
Why! Do you want to meet again?

460
00:47:17,201 --> 00:47:18,725
For heaven's sake,
where does this road go to?

461
00:47:20,704 --> 00:47:21,932
From water to earth

462
00:47:24,875 --> 00:47:29,073
When the sun shines on earth,
the earth goes bone dry

463
00:47:30,881 --> 00:47:36,410
But when this sun falls on a body,
the body is soaked in sweat

464
00:47:39,223 --> 00:47:40,588
And to think both the earth and
the body arise from the soil

465
00:49:32,169 --> 00:49:33,966
Pray, who has knocked on my heart?

466
00:49:35,339 --> 00:49:37,637
Is it you or my solitude?

467
00:49:39,009 --> 00:49:43,639
The one who has stolen my sleep
is wide awake in my eyes

468
00:49:45,015 --> 00:49:47,142
The wind is playing
tricks with me today

469
00:49:48,185 --> 00:49:49,550
The wind has brought the scent
of someone special today

470
00:49:51,355 --> 00:49:57,316
We have met but there is
still a distance

471
00:49:58,362 --> 00:50:00,227
Love means distance perhaps

472
00:50:01,531 --> 00:50:04,500
Whether we meet or separate

473
00:50:05,535 --> 00:50:07,435
Our story remains incomplete

474
00:50:22,886 --> 00:50:23,511
Meenaxi!

475
00:50:25,055 --> 00:50:25,521
here you are

476
00:50:27,724 --> 00:50:29,919
I've been transferred to hyderabad

477
00:50:32,896 --> 00:50:36,696
You could have told me that on the phone.
Why call me here?

478
00:50:38,068 --> 00:50:43,199
To say that you will love hyderabad

479
00:50:45,075 --> 00:50:49,034
Yeah may be. Kameshwar's aunt
has told me that too

480
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:52,139
I was thinking about visiting
hyderabad with her

481
00:50:53,083 --> 00:50:54,277
She used to live there once

482
00:50:55,419 --> 00:50:59,219
You can visit hyderabad with me

483
00:51:01,258 --> 00:51:03,385
Yes but you won't be alone in hyderabad

484
00:51:04,428 --> 00:51:07,829
It's high time you found yourself
a companion. Anyone in mind?

485
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:12,397
Of course I do
Is it Maya?

486
00:51:16,106 --> 00:51:18,404
I don't want to be trapped
in such a web of illusions

487
00:51:22,112 --> 00:51:30,918
This Karanveer is like those
creepy film villains, isn't he?

488
00:51:35,125 --> 00:51:39,084
Who else can be trapped
in the web but you?

489
00:51:40,297 --> 00:51:41,093
It's not a trap

490
00:51:44,134 --> 00:51:47,194
If it isn't a trap, it's a trick

491
00:51:49,139 --> 00:51:55,544
But it's a seductive trick like the
winning move on a chessboard

492
00:51:55,979 --> 00:51:56,775
You've been duped

493
00:51:59,816 --> 00:52:00,282
Meenaxi!

494
00:52:00,484 --> 00:52:05,615
Karan I came here
because you called

495
00:52:06,323 --> 00:52:16,130
You don't have the guts to accept
my answer to your question

496
00:52:17,334 --> 00:52:20,633
how could you even think I would
know the answer to your question

497
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:28,300
NNo one has dared to
ask me such questions

498
00:52:29,679 --> 00:52:30,373
Meenaxi!

499
00:53:19,729 --> 00:53:26,362
What's come over you Karan?
You're sensible

500
00:53:28,238 --> 00:53:30,206
Why chase me?

501
00:53:34,911 --> 00:53:35,775
I'll get Meenaxi

502
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:38,707
She's gone far too beyond

503
00:53:38,915 --> 00:53:40,382
I can reduce the distance between us

504
00:53:41,585 --> 00:53:43,382
NNot possible

505
00:53:45,088 --> 00:53:48,114
If you let me walk with you,
where's the distance?

506
00:53:49,259 --> 00:53:51,056
But I'm walking alone right now

507
00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:55,397
What's this walk talk?

508
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:57,897
Think about it again,
it's a long journey

509
00:53:59,102 --> 00:54:04,233
Karan, I've already thought
about the right person

510
00:54:05,942 --> 00:54:10,242
I should think in the
right direction too

511
00:54:12,616 --> 00:54:18,919
But I can see only one road,
one relationship

512
00:54:22,459 --> 00:54:28,921
Perhaps there's just one road,
one relationship for me as well

513
00:55:15,679 --> 00:55:18,648
What's this?
The Bonalu festival!

514
00:55:18,848 --> 00:55:20,543
Festivals are all the same

515
00:55:21,017 --> 00:55:24,316
I start shuddering a week
before any festival

516
00:55:24,688 --> 00:55:27,816
I don't like the crowds and noise.
I know that.

517
00:55:28,525 --> 00:55:36,899
Let's go, You don't enjoy life at all.
Spice is the variety of life!

518
00:55:38,368 --> 00:55:41,667
You must understand why there's such a
passion for celebration, for the noise,

519
00:55:42,706 --> 00:55:44,503
the madness. May be

520
00:55:45,709 --> 00:55:52,911
It's essential to enter other worlds, but
your story lacks that spice, NNawab sahab

521
00:55:54,217 --> 00:55:58,347
Can't you see, how spontaneously
people meet

522
00:55:59,389 --> 00:56:01,516
walk together & reach the destinations

523
00:56:01,725 --> 00:56:03,192
they have set for themselves in this life?
Yes, you're right

524
00:56:04,728 --> 00:56:06,355
Then your story should
acknowledge that

525
00:56:08,898 --> 00:56:11,025
Chai? Isn't there a particular
time to drink tea?

526
00:56:11,901 --> 00:56:13,926
A particular tea time was decree
by the British colonialists

527
00:56:14,404 --> 00:56:15,871
Come morning, it's bed tea

528
00:56:16,072 --> 00:56:18,939
Tea break's at 11 a. M, then it's
evening high tea at 4 p.m.

529
00:56:19,409 --> 00:56:20,273
O these hinglish Binglish customs

530
00:56:21,411 --> 00:56:25,142
Actually the Chinese founded
the tea ceremony,

531
00:56:25,582 --> 00:56:27,482
they drink tea sitting, standing, sleeping

532
00:56:28,418 --> 00:56:29,476
And we Indians?

533
00:56:29,919 --> 00:56:31,045
Oh we take the tea and bakery!

534
00:56:31,755 --> 00:56:33,723
Especially if we happen
to be hyderabadis,

535
00:56:34,758 --> 00:56:36,726
the tea we guzzle is thick,
sweet, porridgelike

536
00:56:38,928 --> 00:56:41,453
But where are those teashops
and rendezvous points

537
00:56:41,765 --> 00:56:44,563
where conversations would gurgle to the
puffpuffpuffs of hookah smoke?

538
00:56:44,768 --> 00:56:47,828
NNow you can only gulp a cuppa
at the Irani restaurants and scoot

539
00:56:48,772 --> 00:56:50,239
What kind of place is this?
Boss. Yes

540
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:51,737
Bread, hard crusty bread,
salted biscuits

541
00:56:51,941 --> 00:56:53,067
Enough man. NNo need for
reciting the entire list

542
00:56:53,276 --> 00:56:55,244
Just get us two cups of tea

543
00:56:56,446 --> 00:56:58,744
how can we finish our conversation
over just two cuppas?

544
00:56:58,948 --> 00:57:00,313
We're not here for a long
and deep conversation

545
00:57:01,284 --> 00:57:03,184
At most instead of two cups,
we'll drink four cups, maybe six

546
00:57:03,787 --> 00:57:06,915
You're not frazzled by
long conversations but...

547
00:57:07,791 --> 00:57:08,257
But what?

548
00:57:09,292 --> 00:57:10,759
What about the story?

549
00:57:11,294 --> 00:57:13,922
Oh that damn story. Am I writing
the story or are you?

550
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:14,755
Don't worry about the story,
it's my call

551
00:57:14,964 --> 00:57:19,094
Sure it's your call but I am the woman
at the heart of your story

552
00:57:21,371 --> 00:57:23,066
This crowd & noise...

553
00:57:23,807 --> 00:57:25,934
help! I can't drink my tea
in peace amidst this cacophony

554
00:57:26,142 --> 00:57:28,440
Where are you going? Sit

555
00:57:28,645 --> 00:57:29,441
You expect me to
sip tea in this place

556
00:57:29,646 --> 00:57:32,615
Do sit, don't be rattled
by a little noise

557
00:57:32,816 --> 00:57:34,113
how will you ever face
the noise of everyday life?

558
00:57:34,484 --> 00:57:38,284
A noise over which a woman
like me can speak endlessly

559
00:57:38,822 --> 00:57:41,450
Maybe it would be better
if a woman like you quit my story

560
00:57:42,826 --> 00:57:44,293
NNot possible. My dear NNawab,

561
00:57:44,828 --> 00:57:53,133
it's obvious if I don't stay put in your
story it'll have neither life nor power

562
00:57:53,336 --> 00:57:54,303
Power? Yes. Power, josh!

563
00:57:54,504 --> 00:57:55,971
You're talking about josh but
what about my hosh? My sanity?

564
00:57:56,172 --> 00:57:57,639
I'll sit here... okay?

565
00:57:58,341 --> 00:58:01,799
I can neither sleep at nights nor can I
drink tea anymore. Can't eat either

566
00:58:02,011 --> 00:58:02,978
Eat some grapes at least

567
00:58:03,847 --> 00:58:05,314
I wanted to ask you two things

568
00:58:05,515 --> 00:58:07,039
Why two, ask four

569
00:58:08,685 --> 00:58:10,983
You're quick on the
uptake, aren't you?

570
00:58:12,021 --> 00:58:16,981
First tell me, why do your
shoelaces come untied so often?

571
00:58:18,695 --> 00:58:23,655
I don't know how to tie knots

572
00:58:24,534 --> 00:58:28,664
Means you haven't tied the knot yet

573
00:58:29,205 --> 00:58:34,336
Forget my shoes. Why don't you ask me
whether I'm single or not?

574
00:58:35,545 --> 00:58:40,949
Why forget your shoes? You tie
them well enough without knots

575
00:58:42,051 --> 00:58:46,750
NNow I understand what you're
trying to say

576
00:58:49,392 --> 00:58:52,293
Finish your tea, got to show
you something

577
00:58:56,566 --> 00:59:01,094
Aah my Jaisalmer, my golden city

578
00:59:03,239 --> 00:59:04,638
First familiarise yourself with the city,

579
00:59:05,909 --> 00:59:08,309
then you'll be able to familiarise
yourself with its people

580
00:59:10,246 --> 00:59:15,206
But it's said a city can be
understood through its people

581
00:59:17,253 --> 00:59:18,720
You must meet the right people

582
00:59:20,423 --> 00:59:24,052
liked hyderabad
after meeting you

583
00:59:25,762 --> 00:59:30,893
Let's check out Jaisalmer.
I like you

584
00:59:31,935 --> 00:59:35,564
Meaning I have to like you to
understand the spirit of hyderabad

585
00:59:40,610 --> 00:59:42,908
There's no one here...
except the camel

586
00:59:44,614 --> 00:59:48,345
he's the first Rajasthani after all.
Oh okay.

587
00:59:49,452 --> 00:59:52,250
What dark, intoxicating eyes

588
00:59:57,293 --> 01:00:02,162
And since you're Meenaxi,
you have the eyes of a fish,

589
01:00:02,365 --> 01:00:03,798
eyes which don't ever blink,
they're wide open... always

590
01:00:04,133 --> 01:00:09,264
See these hills of stone. Do you
know how they got their majesty?

591
01:00:12,809 --> 01:00:17,610
They were sculpted
by burning rays of the sun

592
01:00:18,982 --> 01:00:25,717
then the sculptors went at the stones with
their sharp, chiselling instruments

593
01:00:26,489 --> 01:00:29,185
And today you gaze from the
sculpted windows and

594
01:00:29,659 --> 01:00:32,287
high balconies to see
Romeo stride ride a camel

595
01:00:32,495 --> 01:00:34,861
delivers a love letter to you

596
01:00:35,999 --> 01:00:37,398
Rajasthan's Juliet has
received the letter,

597
01:00:39,002 --> 01:00:40,970
an epistle of love

598
01:00:43,006 --> 01:00:43,973
She hasn't replied?

599
01:00:46,175 --> 01:00:50,544
The reply has drowned in the depths
of a farflung water well

600
01:00:52,348 --> 01:00:54,077
Will we have to drown
in that well too?

601
01:00:56,853 --> 01:00:58,650
Only the thirsty travel to that well

602
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:31,511
Let these tears, like a necklace of pearl,
remain in you

603
01:01:34,057 --> 01:01:35,854
If they're in the eyes, they're pearls

604
01:01:37,393 --> 01:01:39,361
If they're shed, they're water

605
01:01:43,566 --> 01:01:46,933
I only appreciate pearls,

606
01:01:48,571 --> 01:01:49,697
whether they're in the eyes or

607
01:01:51,741 --> 01:01:52,799
thousands of leagues under the ocean

608
01:01:53,743 --> 01:01:56,268
But these pearls can be
strung around your neck forever

609
01:01:59,749 --> 01:02:01,376
Till today you have only seen perfect

610
01:02:01,584 --> 01:02:04,553
Pearl strings adorning the
neck of a Rajput princess,

611
01:02:04,754 --> 01:02:07,723
But now this string of pearls

612
01:02:08,257 --> 01:02:12,284
are waiting to be picked by the fingers
of someone who's as devoutly in love as Meera

613
01:02:14,931 --> 01:02:15,955
I don't want to pick the pearls

614
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:18,567
What you want is immaterial

615
01:02:19,602 --> 01:02:29,238
Because you have strung the pearls together
with a thread that is indestructible

616
01:03:00,510 --> 01:03:04,970
Someone shows you dreams
Dreams that are true

617
01:03:06,315 --> 01:03:13,118
That someone opens your eyes
To dreams that are true

618
01:03:13,723 --> 01:03:23,792
NNow what name could
be given to such a bond

619
01:03:45,855 --> 01:03:49,814
When the sun is tired

620
01:03:51,127 --> 01:03:55,325
When the day is dying

621
01:03:56,532 --> 01:04:03,665
Then someone unknown
touches my breath

622
01:04:12,582 --> 01:04:15,050
And I feel closer to my heart

623
01:04:15,251 --> 01:04:19,347
My heart comes closer to me

624
01:05:19,315 --> 01:05:28,622
If a pearl drops in a silent stream

625
01:05:29,959 --> 01:05:34,259
It creates a ripple

626
01:05:35,097 --> 01:05:40,592
A ripple which gathers
into a storm

627
01:05:43,306 --> 01:05:53,443
NNow what name could
be given to such a bond

628
01:06:07,296 --> 01:06:11,460
I keep painting portraits

629
01:06:12,501 --> 01:06:16,961
On the canvas of broken voices

630
01:06:17,907 --> 01:06:20,307
I keep looking for a certain face

631
01:06:20,509 --> 01:06:24,969
sometimes on walls,
sometimes on doors

632
01:06:33,956 --> 01:06:36,618
I do not stay with myself

633
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:40,660
Someone calls me from a distance

634
01:06:41,964 --> 01:07:03,217
NNow what name could
be given to such a bond

635
01:07:29,078 --> 01:07:32,047
What's the matter, child?
You look lost

636
01:07:34,750 --> 01:07:39,551
Uncle I can see certain roads,

637
01:07:41,357 --> 01:07:44,724
I can hear the sound of
certain relationships but

638
01:07:45,027 --> 01:07:47,222
Go on

639
01:07:48,264 --> 01:07:52,394
NNothing much. I feel I'm
somewhere far, far away

640
01:07:57,440 --> 01:08:01,069
My feet have the strength
to keep pace with someone,

641
01:08:03,879 --> 01:08:06,746
I want to come closer,
my heart is buoyant with hope

642
01:08:07,550 --> 01:08:09,916
Then why're you afraid?

643
01:08:11,954 --> 01:08:15,913
I'm not afraid.
I don't lack confidence either

644
01:08:16,725 --> 01:08:19,250
I'm only a bit hesitant

645
01:08:22,398 --> 01:08:23,831
You're hesitant like so many girls

646
01:08:24,133 --> 01:08:29,264
That's true. I just need to be
bolder perhaps, spicier

647
01:08:29,972 --> 01:08:35,774
Oh then only the oil
has to be sprinkled

648
01:08:36,979 --> 01:08:38,446
An oil of purity and of ritual

649
01:08:38,981 --> 01:08:41,449
I've found the right guy for you.
he's from Dungarpur

650
01:08:42,151 --> 01:08:45,951
I'd seen him in a polo match,
he's goodlooking, young, virtuous

651
01:08:46,155 --> 01:08:47,452
You'll like him for sure

652
01:11:07,296 --> 01:11:08,422
You here at this hour?

653
01:11:12,801 --> 01:11:19,263
What, what happened Meenaxi?

654
01:11:21,977 --> 01:11:24,775
Who's there?

655
01:11:31,987 --> 01:11:33,454
Meenaxi

656
01:14:39,508 --> 01:14:40,805
In the burning sands of Jaisalmer,
the burning sands...

657
01:14:41,677 --> 01:14:44,305
Burnt my novel.
All my efforts in vain

658
01:14:45,347 --> 01:14:48,407
What should I tell the publisher now?

659
01:14:50,519 --> 01:14:54,819
The world is made, destroyed, remade

660
01:14:55,123 --> 01:14:57,318
It must have a flaw somewhere

661
01:14:57,526 --> 01:14:59,494
You're a champion in quoting

662
01:14:59,862 --> 01:15:04,322
couplets and wasting time my dear NNawab

663
01:15:05,367 --> 01:15:08,268
Six months have whizzed by without
any sign of the story

664
01:15:08,704 --> 01:15:11,764
You haven't prepared a draft or
discussed the matter with me

665
01:15:12,708 --> 01:15:13,174
My dear publisher

666
01:15:13,375 --> 01:15:16,503
the story is incubating in
every little corner of my mind

667
01:15:16,712 --> 01:15:19,510
to the extent I can even
hear the heartbeats of that woman

668
01:15:19,715 --> 01:15:21,182
Who is this wretched woman?

669
01:15:22,217 --> 01:15:24,777
To understand her or
not... that is the question

670
01:15:26,054 --> 01:15:29,353
And who is this boozer,
idiotic motor mechanic?

671
01:15:29,892 --> 01:15:31,359
What does he have to do with
a respectable woman?

672
01:15:31,894 --> 01:15:34,863
You poke your nose into things
you don't understand

673
01:15:35,063 --> 01:15:38,191
A story has to search out
its characters,

674
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:41,699
a form has to be found for
the story so that it can be written

675
01:15:41,904 --> 01:15:43,531
Be patient

676
01:15:43,739 --> 01:15:46,867
I'm not a printing press which
can hack out pages after pages

677
01:15:58,754 --> 01:16:03,214
What's this? The car still
hasn't been repaired

678
01:16:09,765 --> 01:16:12,233
Tell me your name at least

679
01:16:13,936 --> 01:16:16,734
Tell me if you can cure
milady's hiccups

680
01:16:17,773 --> 01:16:19,968
lt'll take some more time,
it needs some more work

681
01:16:20,943 --> 01:16:24,071
My dear fellow in
the state you're in

682
01:16:24,446 --> 01:16:26,539
you're only fit for warbling songs

683
01:16:26,782 --> 01:16:29,410
If you have a flute in your hand,

684
01:16:29,618 --> 01:16:30,585
your garage tools are bound
to be useless

685
01:16:31,954 --> 01:16:34,422
That's the trouble
What's the difference anyway

686
01:16:36,892 --> 01:16:39,918
If you're a mechanic
or a musician?

687
01:16:40,395 --> 01:16:43,922
You're playing some harmonium
or the other every day

688
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:46,427
Stop making up tall tales

689
01:16:46,969 --> 01:16:48,766
My car has a long life

690
01:16:49,638 --> 01:16:52,106
Everything in it makes
a noise except the horn

691
01:17:16,498 --> 01:17:25,634
I was just five when my father
handed a flute to me

692
01:17:27,509 --> 01:17:29,238
That bugger died of booze,

693
01:17:31,513 --> 01:17:34,311
leaving me only with this
flute as a legacy

694
01:18:04,780 --> 01:18:10,218
hey girls, hey girls, let's go
with our tantalising names

695
01:18:40,615 --> 01:18:46,110
Let's go girls,
we'll dance and play

696
01:19:01,269 --> 01:19:03,794
I've trapped a butterfly

697
01:19:04,339 --> 01:19:06,899
A butterfly like one of you

698
01:19:10,278 --> 01:19:18,947
I've trapped your thoughts,
your life in the palm of my hand

699
01:19:19,321 --> 01:19:24,918
I've entered the garden of
your smiles and laughter

700
01:19:25,393 --> 01:19:31,423
Forget your complaints and sorrows

701
01:19:50,085 --> 01:19:55,352
Malli sashaying in your silks, join us

702
01:20:07,736 --> 01:20:13,572
These streets are mine.
This is my playground

703
01:20:13,775 --> 01:20:18,644
The streets tell my story Of love.

704
01:20:18,847 --> 01:20:33,490
Illuminations and hope

705
01:21:13,902 --> 01:21:16,700
I've trapped every contour of your body

706
01:21:16,905 --> 01:21:24,710
Your every breath your every sigh

707
01:21:25,914 --> 01:21:36,620
I've filled your vacant eyes with desire

708
01:23:19,127 --> 01:23:31,369
Western city? May be in Europe...
may be in Prague.

709
01:26:48,736 --> 01:26:51,705
You here?

710
01:26:53,575 --> 01:26:55,543
To give your story a new twist

711
01:26:58,746 --> 01:27:01,806
You didn't find any other town?

712
01:27:02,584 --> 01:27:05,212
Three cities. Prague is one of them,

713
01:27:07,422 --> 01:27:12,382
I'm here to write about
the city and to meet you

714
01:27:14,095 --> 01:27:17,064
Someone told me that a girl called

715
01:27:17,599 --> 01:27:18,827
Maria lives here

716
01:27:20,101 --> 01:27:21,728
I was told several other things

717
01:27:22,937 --> 01:27:24,734
too which resemble parts of my story

718
01:27:26,274 --> 01:27:27,741
A strange coincidence that

719
01:27:29,110 --> 01:27:33,979
My character has stepped out of novel
for a live performance

720
01:27:37,452 --> 01:27:39,511
In a way, I'm a novelist
on the right track

721
01:27:42,724 --> 01:27:45,420
And I'm your Maria

722
01:27:48,796 --> 01:27:53,597
Yes in my story you live
in Prague. Absolutely alone

723
01:27:55,069 --> 01:28:01,269
An orphan who lost her parents
in a car accident

724
01:28:02,477 --> 01:28:04,945
You earn your livelihood
as a waitress in a cafe

725
01:28:05,313 --> 01:28:07,543
and you flirt with life
by acting on stage

726
01:28:08,583 --> 01:28:11,108
You ride a bicycle, you walk
along with your bicycle

727
01:28:13,321 --> 01:28:15,789
I haven't learnt how
to ride a bicycle yet

728
01:28:16,658 --> 01:28:21,891
Maria the time has come for you
to learn how to walk with someone

729
01:31:15,169 --> 01:31:19,128
Are you Kameshwar?

730
01:31:19,340 --> 01:31:25,142
Yes. I found this on
the railway platform

731
01:31:25,346 --> 01:31:31,148
I was standing on the platform
with that sign since eternity

732
01:31:31,352 --> 01:31:34,480
But no one came.
Dr Krasa has sent me to fetch you

733
01:31:34,689 --> 01:31:35,815
You're Maria

734
01:31:36,023 --> 01:31:37,820
Maria, Maria Zarkova

735
01:31:43,297 --> 01:31:46,494
I nearly didn't recognise you
in this long black coat

736
01:31:46,801 --> 01:31:50,669
I thought it was some reverend father

737
01:31:50,872 --> 01:31:52,840
Your thoughts are noble

738
01:31:59,547 --> 01:32:02,778
how do you know Dr Krasa?

739
01:32:05,720 --> 01:32:10,521
he's a professor of Indology
which fascinates me

740
01:32:10,658 --> 01:32:15,061
Is it? I am interested
in Indian culture.

741
01:32:21,402 --> 01:32:24,030
have you ever been to India?

742
01:32:24,739 --> 01:32:36,810
NNo, not yet but maybe some day.
You're to stay in hotel Akron

743
01:32:38,920 --> 01:32:46,656
if you're not tired
how about coffee and a chat?

744
01:32:46,928 --> 01:32:48,555
Two drops, one drink. Why not?

745
01:32:56,437 --> 01:33:00,669
NNow tell me what's this
long black coat all about?

746
01:33:01,609 --> 01:33:04,077
It's not a gown,
it's called a sherwani

747
01:33:04,278 --> 01:33:09,739
Oh and the jeans underneath...
meaning East meets West

748
01:33:10,117 --> 01:33:15,987
It must be that way...
the way I've come here and met you

749
01:33:19,961 --> 01:33:20,757
The coffee's come

750
01:33:21,128 --> 01:33:22,823
I guess the chicken sandwiches
are still walking to the table

751
01:33:23,631 --> 01:33:28,432
Czechoslovensko NNarodini podnik sounds
good. What does it mean?

752
01:33:28,803 --> 01:33:30,270
I'll tell you when the time's right.

753
01:33:31,305 --> 01:33:35,264
Okay I've to get going.
I'll walk you to your house

754
01:33:35,977 --> 01:33:38,775
Two are not allowed
on a bicycle here

755
01:33:38,980 --> 01:33:40,277
Is a license necessary?

756
01:33:40,481 --> 01:33:42,949
Yeah and that takes time. Why?

757
01:33:43,985 --> 01:33:45,782
Czechoslovensko NNarodini podnik

758
01:33:46,487 --> 01:33:46,953
Again. All right,

759
01:33:48,823 --> 01:33:49,619
let's walk to your house...

760
01:33:51,325 --> 01:33:55,625
it couldn't be too far.
Yeah it's not too far

761
01:33:56,831 --> 01:33:59,459
There's a special thrill
in talking while walking together

762
01:33:59,834 --> 01:34:03,634
A walk also helps you to familiarise
yourself with the streets of the city.

763
01:34:04,505 --> 01:34:06,632
Plus your hindi's so honey sweet

764
01:34:33,534 --> 01:34:34,660
We haven't reached your place yet

765
01:34:35,036 --> 01:34:40,440
We passed by it. I didn't want
to cramp our conversation

766
01:34:40,875 --> 01:34:42,001
Which place have we reached?

767
01:34:43,044 --> 01:34:45,512
You tell me where our talk has reached

768
01:34:46,380 --> 01:34:48,678
NNowhere. Our talk is still in progress

769
01:34:49,383 --> 01:34:52,352
As for the place, how should
I know? I'm a stranger

770
01:34:54,055 --> 01:34:57,024
Oiks, where did we
leave the bicycle?

771
01:35:17,411 --> 01:35:20,380
We were so rapt in conversation,

772
01:35:21,082 --> 01:35:23,710
we forgot all about the bicycle between us

773
01:35:24,752 --> 01:35:32,215
Kameshwar! There's a very
famous nunnery behind that door

774
01:35:34,261 --> 01:35:37,059
Don't be scared.
I'm not a nun, I live there

775
01:35:37,932 --> 01:35:41,959
Even if I become a nun, so what!
Then I will become a monk

776
01:35:51,612 --> 01:35:54,080
Czechoslovensko NNarodini podnik

777
01:36:04,859 --> 01:36:08,590
Let's go and find out
why dreams must fade?

778
01:36:08,896 --> 01:36:12,957
Why hearts must stop beating?

779
01:36:13,667 --> 01:36:23,770
Come let's go, it's not far

780
01:36:23,978 --> 01:36:27,436
Perhaps we will find
some friends there

781
01:36:28,115 --> 01:36:31,312
Perhaps there will be
some light there

782
01:36:31,652 --> 01:36:35,952
To find that light

783
01:36:36,157 --> 01:36:40,457
So many lamps have burnt to cinders

784
01:36:40,661 --> 01:36:44,119
Still we must find the lingering
light in the darkness

785
01:36:45,166 --> 01:36:48,795
So what if we have to take
two more steps?

786
01:36:49,003 --> 01:36:59,470
Two more steps towards
our infinite destination?

787
01:36:59,680 --> 01:37:02,706
Before we share a new day together
let me tell you that

788
01:37:03,017 --> 01:37:04,712
my heart has two commitments

789
01:37:05,686 --> 01:37:08,314
One, the Charles Bridge cafe where
I'm a parttime waitress

790
01:37:09,356 --> 01:37:11,381
And second, the Playhouse where
I'm a fulltime actress

791
01:37:13,861 --> 01:37:15,829
The cafe's table
is my bread and butter

792
01:37:16,197 --> 01:37:19,394
and the theatre planks, my sweat

793
01:37:20,534 --> 01:37:22,832
I don't have days,
I have time

794
01:37:23,537 --> 01:37:25,505
Time knows neither
morning nor evening

795
01:37:28,209 --> 01:37:30,677
Yeah I was saying time knows
neither morning nor evening,

796
01:37:31,212 --> 01:37:32,679
time isn't reined in

797
01:37:33,214 --> 01:37:36,843
But time is meaningless if it isn't yoked
to the time of someone else

798
01:37:37,551 --> 01:37:40,076
NNow what right can I have
to someone else's time?

799
01:37:40,888 --> 01:37:44,949
Don't demand time as a right. Just ask for it

800
01:37:45,893 --> 01:37:48,521
Do you have the time to go to the
Prague string music concert with me?

801
01:37:49,396 --> 01:37:53,025
Sure if I don't have a
play rehearsal that evening

802
01:37:53,901 --> 01:37:57,428
There's the Prague film festival too

803
01:37:58,739 --> 01:38:02,869
But what about my cafe job?

804
01:38:05,913 --> 01:38:07,210
Forget all these mundane matters

805
01:38:07,581 --> 01:38:09,208
Maria you'll let me accompany every day

806
01:38:09,416 --> 01:38:12,783
to the high gates
of the nunnery, won't you?

807
01:38:14,588 --> 01:38:15,316
That's sweet of you

808
01:38:17,925 --> 01:38:21,383
NNo bicycle today?

809
01:38:22,429 --> 01:38:23,555
You can't walk alone

810
01:38:24,598 --> 01:38:27,795
Yeah that's why I thought
I'd walk with you today

811
01:38:28,602 --> 01:38:31,127
You've been walking with me
for so many days now

812
01:38:32,606 --> 01:38:36,406
I thought I'd remove the
cycle between us today

813
01:38:36,610 --> 01:38:38,578
What! Do you think of me as a
bicycle which will walk with you?

814
01:38:40,281 --> 01:38:41,475
NNo. I think of you in
an entirely different way

815
01:38:42,216 --> 01:38:46,312
If not as a bicycle, as a horse?

816
01:38:46,921 --> 01:38:47,580
Why a horse?

817
01:38:48,389 --> 01:38:49,583
A bicycle can let you down
when it is punctured

818
01:38:49,790 --> 01:38:51,655
but a horse is always loyal

819
01:38:54,962 --> 01:38:56,623
Correct this line

820
01:39:05,139 --> 01:39:13,945
have some tea

821
01:39:15,249 --> 01:39:18,707
how many days have whizzed by,
how many nights have waned

822
01:39:20,554 --> 01:39:23,284
we've been through all the streets,
all the alleys

823
01:39:25,426 --> 01:39:31,262
but we still have to discover
Prague... and love

824
01:39:33,167 --> 01:39:33,963
But I discovered you

825
01:39:34,601 --> 01:39:35,932
Do you know about the
Taj Mahal, Maria?

826
01:39:37,871 --> 01:39:39,964
A Mughal emperor dreamt of love

827
01:39:42,309 --> 01:39:47,303
he left a priceless monument sculpted
of white marble... for his love

828
01:39:49,583 --> 01:39:54,543
Centuries have not been able
to touch the rare pearl

829
01:39:56,390 --> 01:40:02,260
left in the heart of hindustan

830
01:41:03,524 --> 01:41:07,392
Why am I so restless?
Why do I smolder?

831
01:41:08,295 --> 01:41:10,525
Why am I ablaze? N fire?

832
01:41:10,731 --> 01:41:31,108
Why is every pore of my body assailed by
smoke, these clouds of smoke?

833
01:42:10,357 --> 01:42:16,318
Our love flowered

834
01:42:18,165 --> 01:42:23,125
We met, no one could separate us

835
01:42:23,437 --> 01:42:35,645
Winds and gales could not
come between us

836
01:42:36,350 --> 01:42:37,817
Then why is every pore of my body

837
01:42:38,252 --> 01:42:47,820
assailed by smoke,
these clouds of smoke?

838
01:43:31,004 --> 01:43:50,585
The leaping flames of fire
are devouring me

839
01:44:03,604 --> 01:44:19,419
What kind of a fire is this?
I'm melting, mmm... melting

840
01:44:19,620 --> 01:44:23,454
The rains are stranger

841
01:44:24,458 --> 01:44:32,797
The rains cannot douse the raging fire

842
01:44:33,300 --> 01:44:35,996
My heartbeats are straying,

843
01:44:36,203 --> 01:44:39,001
time has come under
an intoxicating spell

844
01:44:47,981 --> 01:44:50,609
Why is every pore of my body

845
01:44:53,153 --> 01:45:04,963
assailed by smoke,
these clouds of smoke?

846
01:45:31,725 --> 01:45:33,215
What are you looking at?

847
01:45:33,660 --> 01:45:38,563
I can see colours, a glow

848
01:45:38,799 --> 01:45:47,707
That glow & the colour is a face...
an identity.

849
01:45:47,874 --> 01:45:49,933
My gaze has made an identity

850
01:45:51,645 --> 01:45:57,675
that identity is a wondrous face
which you have worn

851
01:45:57,818 --> 01:46:05,054
Aren't you getting cheated, are you?
What you see dosen't exist.

852
01:46:05,726 --> 01:46:09,127
What you don't see, does exists

853
01:46:12,399 --> 01:46:16,358
Maria I don't know why
I worry about you constantly

854
01:46:18,772 --> 01:46:23,072
That's because I'm
the heroine of your story

855
01:46:24,411 --> 01:46:26,242
and you've even sent me a hero

856
01:46:27,080 --> 01:46:33,986
Kameshwar who can repair
my bicycle and walk with me

857
01:46:35,922 --> 01:46:39,619
he walked with you
but did anything happen?

858
01:46:41,094 --> 01:46:56,636
Yes and no. I'm not confused but
I have to sort this out myself

859
01:48:22,429 --> 01:48:24,863
Blood!

860
01:48:25,732 --> 01:48:29,099
But there's no blood in your story

861
01:48:31,771 --> 01:48:33,329
Why're you being so morbid?

862
01:48:39,312 --> 01:48:40,506
I'm not

863
01:48:42,949 --> 01:48:44,348
I came to ask you

864
01:48:46,553 --> 01:48:50,614
if you're writing about Joan of Arc
performed at the theatre

865
01:48:52,225 --> 01:48:53,692
will anyone understand
your gobbledygook?

866
01:48:56,229 --> 01:48:59,130
Do you think there's only one kind
of a woman in this world?

867
01:49:04,004 --> 01:49:05,028
Give it to me.

868
01:49:11,344 --> 01:49:13,710
Who's this flashing his
teeth for no reason

869
01:49:14,581 --> 01:49:19,314
The message of this graffiti is
Prague's face is a happy face

870
01:49:19,986 --> 01:49:21,510
Didn't it laugh earlier?

871
01:49:23,757 --> 01:49:28,592
There are many types of laughter

872
01:49:29,696 --> 01:49:34,395
Like mischievous laughter or
mocking laughter

873
01:49:34,501 --> 01:49:39,632
Very few can laugh at themselves

874
01:49:40,106 --> 01:49:40,572
There you go again

875
01:49:41,074 --> 01:49:45,568
You can break into a lecture like a
professor on any subject under the sun

876
01:49:50,617 --> 01:49:56,749
Why do we stick labels on our faces?

877
01:49:57,991 --> 01:50:04,419
Labels like produced in India,
Japan, America?

878
01:50:05,999 --> 01:50:10,095
We can't choose our birth place

879
01:50:11,137 --> 01:50:17,804
NNo label is authentic.
Labels are useless,

880
01:50:18,378 --> 01:50:22,144
they can't even tell you if a
product is genuine or fake

881
01:50:24,017 --> 01:50:27,612
Like Czechoslovensko NNarodini podnik

882
01:50:29,489 --> 01:50:30,183
heavens, I'm getting out of here

883
01:50:36,463 --> 01:50:39,296
Darkness is upon me. Let the
lights be on for a while

884
01:50:41,167 --> 01:50:42,634
Let me light my heart,
light your hearts for me,

885
01:50:42,836 --> 01:50:44,633
Save me from the darkness for a while

886
01:50:46,039 --> 01:50:49,133
NNawab sahab, don't take the
trouble of lighting your heart

887
01:50:50,910 --> 01:50:51,842
What a coincidence

888
01:50:53,079 --> 01:50:55,240
I have come here as if I were
the light of the couplet

889
01:50:58,852 --> 01:51:02,015
Why are you aflame?

890
01:51:02,355 --> 01:51:08,260
Come pick up your pen and complete
the Maria of your story

891
01:51:09,629 --> 01:51:11,494
Do you understand?

892
01:51:12,599 --> 01:51:16,399
That Kameshwar the imaginary
nerd you sent after me,

893
01:51:18,438 --> 01:51:21,669
he's just like you

894
01:51:29,015 --> 01:51:31,415
When will the fever of
this book abate?

895
01:51:34,320 --> 01:51:37,881
If NNagma were here, she would
have taken care of everything

896
01:51:45,565 --> 01:51:48,033
She'll be here tomorrow

897
01:51:50,303 --> 01:51:56,503
My life is at a crucial juncture,
you are right before my eyes

898
01:51:57,177 --> 01:52:05,551
You my creator, why have
you brought me here

899
01:52:05,752 --> 01:52:09,779
and where do you intend
to take me from here?

900
01:52:11,057 --> 01:52:18,054
NNowhere. Quit the pages of my book,
I want to free you from my story

901
01:52:18,898 --> 01:52:20,627
You have become the real Maria

902
01:52:22,202 --> 01:52:28,573
I won't leave. I won't let you
end your novel so abruptly

903
01:52:30,076 --> 01:52:34,240
I will now play the role of Maria
on the stage of life

904
01:53:41,347 --> 01:53:45,647
Gardener any news of NNawab sahab?

905
01:53:45,885 --> 01:53:50,982
Bibiji I haven't seen him for days
Don't know where he's vanished

906
01:53:51,191 --> 01:53:52,658
Why don't you know where he is?

907
01:53:53,893 --> 01:53:58,796
You don't know I'd quit working
here after NNagma's wedding?

908
01:53:59,632 --> 01:54:02,499
I haven't seen him anywhere

909
01:54:02,702 --> 01:54:04,602
Ooof. Where could he have gone?

910
01:54:04,804 --> 01:54:07,568
NNagma's due to arrive.
What am I to say to her?

911
01:54:26,392 --> 01:54:28,189
Yes?

912
01:54:29,762 --> 01:54:32,196
I'm Kunal. NNawab sahab?

913
01:54:34,400 --> 01:54:36,368
What do you want?

914
01:54:37,804 --> 01:54:42,764
I wanted to thank him.
I've given up all my bad habits

915
01:54:43,576 --> 01:54:46,875
I'm setting off on a new road,
the road which he showed me

916
01:54:48,581 --> 01:54:51,209
I want to earn fame as a singer

917
01:54:52,385 --> 01:54:55,548
I wanted to give this to him

918
01:54:58,892 --> 01:55:00,484
But he doesn't live
in this city anymore

919
01:55:12,405 --> 01:55:13,064
Weirdoes!

920
01:55:19,112 --> 01:55:20,511
Who was it?

921
01:55:28,288 --> 01:55:29,414
how do I express my gratitude?

922
01:55:30,757 --> 01:55:31,485
I'm leaving

923
01:55:33,092 --> 01:55:37,654
but before that I want to assure
you that your Meenaxi is alive

924
01:55:40,333 --> 01:55:44,895
These segments of your story,
these pages lie scattered

925
01:55:46,239 --> 01:55:50,972
Your Meenaxi is walking on the
strength of your pen

926
01:55:51,778 --> 01:55:55,612
her steps are firmly grounded,
she isn't wavering

927
01:55:57,617 --> 01:56:00,450
Meenaxi has walked a very long
way through your story

928
01:56:01,921 --> 01:56:07,291
Your pen wrote uncertainly
at several points

929
01:56:08,394 --> 01:56:12,660
Yet Meenaxi accelerated her
speed till the day

930
01:56:14,200 --> 01:56:16,031
she could come out of your story

931
01:56:16,703 --> 01:56:20,469
Then this pen was no longer yours,
it belonged to Meenaxi

932
01:56:21,507 --> 01:56:27,639
You were shocked, you weren't sure
where I'd lead your story to

933
01:56:28,948 --> 01:56:31,473
The story was no longer
limited by the pen

934
01:56:33,586 --> 01:56:35,611
You tried to snatch the pen
away from Meenaxi

935
01:56:36,923 --> 01:56:43,226
NNow your Meenaxi stand
before you as real as life

936
01:56:44,697 --> 01:56:48,929
Look your eyesight is fading

937
01:56:50,803 --> 01:56:54,000
You see me but only as a shadow

938
01:56:56,242 --> 01:56:59,177
Look you've become so weak

939
01:57:00,980 --> 01:57:05,713
You cannot touch my soul

940
01:57:12,759 --> 01:57:17,196
Surely you can hear
someone's voice

941
01:57:18,831 --> 01:57:23,700
Surely you can hear
the call of music

942
01:57:25,505 --> 01:57:35,540
Who is calling out to us?
Let's find out

943
01:57:35,782 --> 01:57:39,218
So what if the road is lonely?

944
01:57:39,786 --> 01:57:43,381
So what if the night is as silent as a tomb?

945
01:57:43,589 --> 01:57:47,389
Let's be together always

946
01:57:47,660 --> 01:57:52,256
We have weathered
so many storms together

947
01:57:52,999 --> 01:57:56,560
So what if we have to weather
some more storms?

948
01:57:57,270 --> 01:58:14,450
Let's take two more steps
towards our infinite destination

949
01:59:37,570 --> 01:59:42,439
Is life a thought?
Or the search of a thought?

950
02:00:12,205 --> 02:00:13,365
The wayward foolfoolfoolishness of the heart

951
02:00:13,573 --> 02:00:16,371
The unfaithfulness of the heart

952
02:00:24,150 --> 02:00:29,213
O beauty don't ask me why or where.
Just take me away with you

953
02:00:29,989 --> 02:00:35,052
Life is a secret a deep secret

954
02:00:35,861 --> 02:00:43,791
Why unlock the secret?

955
02:00:44,770 --> 02:00:49,833
Someone unknown, walked
silentfooted into my life

956
02:00:50,943 --> 02:00:52,911
And I didn't even know
how a moment changed

957
02:00:53,112 --> 02:00:56,013
into 400 long nights and three stories

958
02:00:56,983 --> 02:00:58,075
Like I didn't know

959
02:00:59,652 --> 02:01:05,420
how Meenaxi was born from the
womb of the book

960
02:01:09,962 --> 02:01:11,589
This life is so strange

961
02:01:14,200 --> 02:01:17,260
Is this life just another book?

962
02:01:34,887 --> 02:01:35,785
Who are you?

963
02:01:36,489 --> 02:01:39,014
I am Meenaxi
