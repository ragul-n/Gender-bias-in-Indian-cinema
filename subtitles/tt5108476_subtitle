1
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:55,318
What the... the telly!

2
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,404
Psycho! You need meds.

3
00:03:57,696 --> 00:04:00,365
How do I watch the
Arsenal-Leicester match?

4
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,325
Stupid French witch!

5
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:05,745
Delhi idiot, go watch the match
with the other idiot Mehra.

6
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:10,000
As for the TV, this French witch won
it at the Xmas fair. Remember?

7
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,544
But I paid for the fair tickets.
Remember?

8
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:14,462
Tough luck, Desi boy.

9
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:16,313
Get your own telly,
if you can afford it.

10
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:18,174
You wanna go there? Fine!

11
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:21,886
Wasn't even HD. I'll get the latest.
3D, HD.

12
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,764
7.1 surround sound. It's
Game of Thrones all night.

13
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:28,018
No more: "Turn the sound down,
I have an early start."

14
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,603
You can't take that.
I bought it.

15
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:33,106
It was my birthday present.

16
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:37,736
You know what. Don't want
your stupid present.

17
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:41,322
Just 'cos I like Tweety doesn't mean
you stuff the house with them.

18
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,867
- Bloody twit.
- That's my t-shirt!

19
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:52,500
You're impossible!

20
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:54,794
No swearing in French.

21
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:56,379
You know what.

22
00:04:56,963 --> 00:05:00,633
You left Delhi but your hooligan
Delhi talk didn't leave you.

23
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:02,092
Oh yeah?

24
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:06,389
At least I'm not a French slut,
sleeping with every man in Paris.

25
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:21,988
You know what.

26
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:25,158
I thought it was my bad.

27
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,495
Thank you for clearing that up.

28
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:30,287
Goodbye.

29
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:44,385
Taxi.

30
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:05,532
Miss...

31
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,199
Ok.

32
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:27,178
Hi, baby!

33
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:30,015
Shyra darling, what a surprise!

34
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:35,311
If I can use my room without
the third degree, I'll stay.

35
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:38,064
Or I go to Kim's. You guys decide.

36
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:56,291
Delete his number from your phones.

37
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:59,336
Mum, block him on Facebook too.

38
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:03,715
You're on Facebook?

39
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:08,011
I'm from Delhi,
she's from Paris.

40
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:12,724
Delhi and Paris? Not happening, boss.

41
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:14,851
No connection.

42
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:17,479
It was too good to last.

43
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:22,275
Sat for an English exam, the questions
came in French. Had to fail.

44
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:27,572
Falling in love is like investing
in mutual funds.

45
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:31,993
We think they'll pay dividends
when they mature.

46
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:36,664
But we don't think: "Mutual funds
are subject to market risks."

47
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:40,335
"Read the offer document carefully
before investing." Otherwise...

48
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,253
it's breakup.

49
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:46,591
Breakups are a pain in the...

50
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,677
When a boy gets dumped...

51
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:52,722
his mates get busy perfecting
the vanishing act.

52
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:55,934
The married guys are busy with
their wives. You married?

53
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:57,477
- Yes.
- It shows.

54
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:02,023
The single guys are busy at work.

55
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:07,487
When a girl goes through a breakup,
that's another ball game.

56
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:11,491
Hi, Shyra. Heard about your breakup.
You ok?

57
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:15,620
I'm ok. No sweat. I'm on my
way to work. I'll call later.

58
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:21,126
Hi, Shyra. I heard the news.
Are you ok?

59
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:22,877
It's ok.

60
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:25,797
Guess it wasn't meant to be.

61
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,675
Hi, Shyra. I heard
what happened last night.

62
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,810
- You ok?
- I'm all right. I'm not depressed.

63
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:33,596
Not drinking, I'm not planning
to kill myself.

64
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:36,266
Busy at work. I'll call you later.

65
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,437
Welcome to Paris Sidewalk Tours.

66
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:44,024
One of the most romantic bridges
in Paris - Pont des Arts.

67
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,901
It's famously called
"The Love Lock Bridge."

68
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:50,447
There were over a million
padlocks here a year ago.

69
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:53,074
Couples pledged their love
with a signed padlock...

70
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:55,326
then they'd throw the key
into the river.

71
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:58,288
They believed that their love,
like the padlocks...

72
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:00,790
would stay locked forever.

73
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:04,419
A year ago the city authorities
removed all the love locks...

74
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,715
because the weight was
weakening the bridge.

75
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:11,134
Now padlocks are banned.

76
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:14,679
Even the world's most romantic
city understood that...

77
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:17,223
few can carry the weight
of love.

78
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,934
We stop here for 15 minutes.

79
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:24,439
So if anybody wants to click photos,
please do.

80
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:30,528
The only way to avoid the sting
of a breakup...

81
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:34,574
is never to fall in love's trap.

82
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:38,203
If you don't hook up,
you won't break up.

83
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:42,999
The wisest of the wise haven't
escaped from hooking up.

84
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,418
So how could a fool like me
stay free?

85
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:47,796
- A poem!
- Please...

86
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:49,089
Thank you!

87
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:52,509
A guy called Dharam
came to Paris...

88
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:53,801
Bravo!

89
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:57,514
"A guy called Dharam came to
make Parisians laugh out loud."

90
00:09:58,056 --> 00:10:01,184
"A girl stripped him so bare..."

91
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:03,895
"All he's now left with
is his underwear."

92
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:11,903
One year ago

93
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:20,203
9 rue Théodule Ribot?
What an address!

94
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,247
Welcome to Paris, Dharam.

95
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:25,375
Hi, I'm Natalie.

96
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:30,422
You are Dharma, right?

97
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:33,258
Dharam! No "a" at the end.

98
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:35,969
Sorry. Come with me.

99
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:40,557
So this is your room,
window opens to the church.

100
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:46,980
I love Jesus.

101
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:50,442
Bathroom - just one.
You and I using same.

102
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:02,162
Great. Superb, Natalie-jee!

103
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:06,291
So you have butter, eggs, fruit.

104
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:07,959
Coffee, tea.

105
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:10,462
Everything you need.
So just please yourself, ok?

106
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,088
Catch you later.

107
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,843
Yes! Paradise at last!

108
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:21,890
How are you?

109
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:23,391
Good, darling.

110
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:27,062
This is my girlfriend, Naomi.

111
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:28,772
Naomi... Dharma.

112
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,030
Bonjour!

113
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:43,870
You're terrific, Mehra.
The flat's paradise.

114
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:45,288
The ultimate!

115
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:48,458
Don't need Internet.
I've got free live shows.

116
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:52,087
Very nice people, the French.

117
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:53,338
Forget about caste!

118
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:55,173
They don't differentiate between
boys from girls.

119
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:57,425
What a culture! I love the French.

120
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,678
Started your old tricks?

121
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:03,264
You're here to work,
not to enjoy Paris.

122
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:06,559
If your jokes go limp, next flight
home for you, boy.

123
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,144
Relax, Mehra!

124
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:10,814
Since college my jokes
made you double up.

125
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:13,274
Now no confidence in your bro?

126
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:16,152
Your bro's not out of gas.
I'm pure kick ass!

127
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:20,365
I'll make your Delhi Belly the No.1
Paris bar, or change my name.

128
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:23,535
That's why I spent mucho euros
jetting you here.

129
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:27,622
Pull in all the Indians of Paris
with your comedy nights...

130
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:29,666
then we'll print money!

131
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,585
Ok, Mr Slumdog Millionaire...

132
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:35,296
print and mint we will.

133
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:38,299
But first tell me where's
the hottest bar in Paris.

134
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:42,345
Dharam, tomorrow's your first show...

135
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:45,724
Mehra, my love. For the show
to rock tomorrow...

136
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,394
Dharam needs to rock today!

137
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:44,699
So sorry.

138
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:49,162
François, water. Quick!

139
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:52,332
Thank you.

140
00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:04,552
- You're a lifesaver, François.
- No worries.

141
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:13,269
- Buy you a drink?
- Thanks, not drinking today.

142
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:17,107
Vodka? Bacardi?
Petrol? Jägerbomb?

143
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:20,652
No French, eh?

144
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:24,322
- Indian?
- I'm French. Parents Indian.

145
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:29,494
Sorry.

146
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:32,455
Thought French might score.

147
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:35,458
I've tried for hours. No luck.

148
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:37,836
In desperation I tried French.

149
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:41,756
Now that's quite honest.
I'm impressed.

150
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:45,510
See, for something like that,
my friend, I'm buying.

151
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:47,637
What are you having?

152
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:53,309
François, the same. Two.

153
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,353
Come on up.

154
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,273
- I'm Shyra.
- Dharam.

155
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:00,400
So Desperate Dharam...

156
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:03,528
scan the lovelies.
Who catches your eye?

157
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:08,366
My eyes are stuck on you,
they won't unstick.

158
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:12,120
Ah! That's sweet but it's not
gonna work.

159
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:15,290
- Not into Indian guys.
- I can understand.

160
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:19,919
Not into Indian guys either.
They smell of fenugreek.

161
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:25,300
Wicked sense of humour!
Not bad, impressed again.

162
00:15:26,176 --> 00:15:29,262
- Are we doing this or not?
- Come! Yeah.

163
00:15:30,722 --> 00:15:33,058
Show me the girl you fancy.

164
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:35,769
I'll tell you your chances.

165
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:42,859
Choosy, aren't we?

166
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:44,903
No one?

167
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:47,364
They're all gorgeous.

168
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:49,783
But I'm stuck on you.

169
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:52,202
No one else will do.

170
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:54,871
Thank you for helping me out.

171
00:15:55,372 --> 00:15:57,874
One drink with you
is enough for me.

172
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:02,754
You'll ditch me soon. So till then,
let's enjoy the moment. Cheers!

173
00:16:03,838 --> 00:16:06,841
Everybody, get ready for the
chicken wings contest!

174
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:17,060
The winner of the chicken
wings contest gets...

175
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,688
free food and drinks for a year!

176
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:21,564
Now you're talking!

177
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,693
I dare you!

178
00:16:26,695 --> 00:16:29,072
You win, I party with you.

179
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,074
Is that so?

180
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:37,455
Delhi folk can be weak in matters
of the heart, but not in dares.

181
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:39,373
You're on.

182
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:41,375
Ok.

183
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:45,296
Here's a player!

184
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:45,148
Your smile is bewitching.
I'm crazy about you.

185
00:17:46,024 --> 00:17:49,611
Desire takes me over.
Your voice melts me.

186
00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:08,963
The girl's like a heady drink.

187
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:13,677
Like a soaring kite
cutting another.

188
00:18:26,189 --> 00:18:29,359
She reeled me in,
no time to cut loose.

189
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:45,083
Like a lofty kite, a dervish entranced.
In a flash I was high.

190
00:18:45,709 --> 00:18:47,627
Like a shock wave,
a search warrant.

191
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:50,088
Like a secret download.

192
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:52,716
The girl's like a heady drink.

193
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,554
Like a soaring kite
cutting another.

194
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:27,500
Like new spring,
like a clean slate.

195
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:29,919
Like cement filling the cracks.

196
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:32,339
Like sparring sexy eyes.

197
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:34,591
Hitting the jackpot at last.

198
00:19:35,467 --> 00:19:37,177
Her name is all over my lips.

199
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:42,140
She runs in my veins.

200
00:19:45,268 --> 00:19:47,228
Like a crazy tale,
she's wild youth.

201
00:19:47,604 --> 00:19:49,647
Like ice melting through
your fingers.

202
00:19:49,981 --> 00:19:52,233
Like a river flowing,
mischief smiling.

203
00:19:52,484 --> 00:19:54,527
Like a favour that's big trouble.

204
00:19:55,487 --> 00:19:57,781
She reeled me in,
no time to cut loose.

205
00:20:00,158 --> 00:20:02,077
The girl's like a heady drink.

206
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:06,831
Like a kite cutting another.

207
00:20:20,387 --> 00:20:22,639
Like a kite flying over rooftops.

208
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:28,353
Crossing the crossroads
of my heart.

209
00:20:30,313 --> 00:20:33,608
Smiling she wanders, she roams.

210
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:37,862
She grabs my heart.

211
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:45,203
Your smile is bewitching.
I'm crazy about you.

212
00:20:46,204 --> 00:20:50,041
Desire takes me over.
Your voice melts me.

213
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:34,919
Leaving?

214
00:21:37,297 --> 00:21:39,049
Party's over, back to real life.

215
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:43,845
Without my number, how will you
call when you miss me?

216
00:21:46,431 --> 00:21:47,431
Cute!

217
00:21:50,894 --> 00:21:54,105
You know I recently broke up.
Wanna be single for a bit.

218
00:21:54,481 --> 00:21:57,984
Wasn't looking to hook up
last night...

219
00:21:58,526 --> 00:22:02,322
but your goofy lines, your
sexy dance moves got me.

220
00:22:03,281 --> 00:22:04,574
I just let go.

221
00:22:05,909 --> 00:22:07,994
So no phone calls, please.

222
00:22:12,332 --> 00:22:13,833
Leave me your number.

223
00:22:14,334 --> 00:22:15,543
Don't know a soul in Paris.

224
00:22:15,877 --> 00:22:18,880
If I get molested or mugged,
I could call you for help.

225
00:22:19,214 --> 00:22:20,214
One minute.

226
00:22:20,632 --> 00:22:23,802
An Indian has a duty
to help another Indian.

227
00:22:24,135 --> 00:22:25,887
Shyra! Where's your patriotism?

228
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:42,112
So, she didn't like what you had?

229
00:22:42,696 --> 00:22:44,823
What to do? She also likes girls.

230
00:22:45,407 --> 00:22:46,950
I'm going back to India.

231
00:22:49,786 --> 00:22:51,246
What is this?

232
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,082
- Cornflakes.
- I hate cornflakes.

233
00:23:13,518 --> 00:23:14,519
Hello, hi.

234
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:17,063
Can you tell me which cornflake
is this?

235
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:19,941
Follow me.

236
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:24,946
- Here.
- So many?

237
00:23:25,488 --> 00:23:29,576
Madam! You don't understand.
My ex is crazy.

238
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:33,496
She takes out the cornflakes from
the box, puts in a jar...

239
00:23:33,997 --> 00:23:36,958
throws away the box. I don't know
the name of this cornflake.

240
00:23:37,334 --> 00:23:39,214
I can't have breakfast without it.
My favourite!

241
00:23:39,377 --> 00:23:41,046
Please tell me which one?

242
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:54,934
- Sorry, we don't have this one.
- Did you have to eat it?

243
00:23:55,352 --> 00:23:57,103
My last cornflake! Now what?

244
00:23:57,312 --> 00:24:00,398
- Anything else?
- Poison? Special present for you.

245
00:24:09,991 --> 00:24:13,328
Run, baby, run!

246
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,719
Narrow escape, sonny.
Almost bowled out.

247
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:34,224
The witch has special powers.
She sprouts up out of the air.

248
00:24:34,766 --> 00:24:36,935
Time to chill, sonny.

249
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:38,561
Hiding from me?

250
00:24:43,942 --> 00:24:45,318
It's you!

251
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:49,072
What brings you here?
Sorry, I didn't see you.

252
00:24:49,823 --> 00:24:50,823
How are you?

253
00:24:51,783 --> 00:24:54,369
Mehra was asking after you,
call him sometime.

254
00:24:54,786 --> 00:24:55,786
Cut it out, Dharam.

255
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:58,456
Politeness doesn't suit
Delhi boys.

256
00:24:59,124 --> 00:25:01,543
And you don't have to run
when you see me.

257
00:25:03,003 --> 00:25:07,924
I thought if we spoke, you'd get
a flashback of our past.

258
00:25:08,466 --> 00:25:11,052
Look at me! Think I'm
the flashback type?

259
00:25:12,887 --> 00:25:17,517
If we bump into each other again,
can I say hi?

260
00:25:19,352 --> 00:25:20,352
Just hi!

261
00:25:22,605 --> 00:25:25,066
Put them in a jar, they spoil
in the box.

262
00:25:26,443 --> 00:25:28,319
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

263
00:25:29,904 --> 00:25:32,615
Who's single tonight, besides me?

264
00:25:34,576 --> 00:25:35,576
Bravo!

265
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:40,874
A beer from the singles for
the unlucky hooked-up guys.

266
00:25:44,377 --> 00:25:46,421
When you're single again...

267
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,591
every girl looks appealing.

268
00:26:05,357 --> 00:26:08,401
But the girls may not
find you appealing.

269
00:26:08,902 --> 00:26:10,862
Only one rule to avoid being single.

270
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:12,405
Never give up!

271
00:26:40,517 --> 00:26:43,395
Alcohol is not the only cure.

272
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:47,649
There are healthier options:
Gardens, parks.

273
00:26:49,317 --> 00:26:52,904
There's an old saying: "You make
girls laugh and they're yours."

274
00:26:53,446 --> 00:26:57,158
I say: "Make kids happy,
their Mummys are yours."

275
00:26:57,701 --> 00:26:59,285
Especially single mums.

276
00:27:01,413 --> 00:27:02,914
Antoine Griezmann!

277
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:08,920
Come, careful.

278
00:27:16,511 --> 00:27:18,888
Papa's here for the night.

279
00:27:19,639 --> 00:27:21,766
- Papa!
- He's not your Papa.

280
00:27:24,394 --> 00:27:26,104
- You all right?
- Yeah.

281
00:27:26,479 --> 00:27:28,648
- Hi. Dharam.
- Hi. Marie.

282
00:27:29,107 --> 00:27:30,608
- Nice to meet you.
- Me, too.

283
00:27:31,067 --> 00:27:32,527
I can see where he gets his smile.

284
00:27:33,236 --> 00:27:35,155
Thank you very much.

285
00:27:35,613 --> 00:27:36,613
My pleasure.

286
00:27:38,742 --> 00:27:40,785
Long live Mummy love!

287
00:27:45,623 --> 00:27:51,254
I love Indian food, Indian music,
everything about India.

288
00:27:51,755 --> 00:27:54,883
I'm the most Indian thing
you'll find in Paris.

289
00:27:55,342 --> 00:28:00,930
100% pure Indian. Exotic like
jungle boy Mowgli.

290
00:28:01,473 --> 00:28:04,351
Like to see Incredible India?

291
00:28:05,018 --> 00:28:06,018
Tonight!

292
00:28:06,019 --> 00:28:09,564
Tonight. At your service, madame.
Chin-chin.

293
00:28:13,401 --> 00:28:15,445
Here's the menu. Good evening.

294
00:28:21,743 --> 00:28:24,454
I'm so sorry. Should I show you
the men's room?

295
00:28:26,164 --> 00:28:27,707
I'll be right back.

296
00:28:28,875 --> 00:28:30,919
- Where?
- This way, please.

297
00:28:38,009 --> 00:28:39,511
Why did you screw up my date?

298
00:28:39,761 --> 00:28:42,514
Zip up your jealousy. We broke up
6 months ago.

299
00:28:42,931 --> 00:28:46,059
Have you lost it, Dharam? Couldn't
you find another restaurant?

300
00:28:46,351 --> 00:28:48,728
How did I know you switched
from guide to waitress?

301
00:28:49,062 --> 00:28:50,480
- It's Sunday night.
- So?

302
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:53,733
I help my parents on Sundays.
Remember?

303
00:28:54,651 --> 00:28:57,904
- Is this your Dad's restaurant?
- Thought I flipped seeing your date?

304
00:28:58,279 --> 00:29:00,119
- Wasn't it the "Indian Summer?"
- Name change.

305
00:29:00,323 --> 00:29:01,825
But why? It was doing ok.

306
00:29:02,158 --> 00:29:05,120
- The chutney was bland, but...
- That's not...

307
00:29:05,995 --> 00:29:07,122
the point. Goddammit!

308
00:29:07,414 --> 00:29:10,792
If my parents see you here
on a date, they'll freak out.

309
00:29:11,292 --> 00:29:13,503
Our breakup still upsets them.

310
00:29:13,795 --> 00:29:16,131
Indian parents are too sentimental.

311
00:29:16,923 --> 00:29:19,009
Baby, what about table 18?

312
00:29:35,692 --> 00:29:36,818
Bless me, uncle.

313
00:29:38,862 --> 00:29:40,155
Bless me, auntie.

314
00:29:46,244 --> 00:29:48,830
- He came to apologize?
- No, Mum. He's on a date.

315
00:29:54,336 --> 00:29:56,004
On a date?

316
00:29:56,629 --> 00:30:00,383
Scumbag! I could shove
a skewer up his...

317
00:30:03,345 --> 00:30:06,139
Bad service, bad restaurant,
my bad.

318
00:30:06,556 --> 00:30:08,600
I'm a bad boy, punish me.
Let's go.

319
00:30:08,933 --> 00:30:11,186
- This is our specialty.
- Thank you.

320
00:30:13,688 --> 00:30:16,733
You maybe my ex, but you've no right
to run Dad's restaurant down.

321
00:30:17,108 --> 00:30:19,152
- It's delicious.
- Thank you.

322
00:30:19,736 --> 00:30:20,820
So you mean...

323
00:30:21,363 --> 00:30:24,157
you have no problem with me
eating here?

324
00:30:24,532 --> 00:30:27,118
I mean my ex serving
my new girlfriend?

325
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:28,410
No.

326
00:30:29,621 --> 00:30:31,623
You really are French.

327
00:30:32,207 --> 00:30:33,458
Always was.

328
00:30:34,584 --> 00:30:37,587
- I'm Shyra.
- Delighted. I'm Marie.

329
00:30:37,962 --> 00:30:40,465
- We lived together ages ago.
- I see.

330
00:30:41,132 --> 00:30:43,134
Shyra and me are good friends.
Old friends.

331
00:30:43,843 --> 00:30:46,262
Don't overdo it.
She knows you're my ex.

332
00:30:46,596 --> 00:30:48,515
And, we were never friends.

333
00:30:48,848 --> 00:30:51,393
We were lovers and they
can't be friends.

334
00:30:51,851 --> 00:30:55,313
Spoken like a true Delhi boy!
Some free advice?

335
00:30:55,772 --> 00:30:59,693
Don't lay it on too thick. I told her
you can't last long.

336
00:31:00,068 --> 00:31:01,695
So typical of you!

337
00:31:02,904 --> 00:31:06,783
Breaking up has fried her brains.
She's jealous, ignore her.

338
00:31:07,575 --> 00:31:08,868
How's the kebab?

339
00:31:10,328 --> 00:31:12,205
The witch must have spat on it.

340
00:31:13,373 --> 00:31:14,374
Chin-chin!

341
00:31:27,971 --> 00:31:29,347
Good morning, guys!

342
00:31:30,348 --> 00:31:33,601
We start our tour in the
Tuileries Garden.

343
00:31:34,019 --> 00:31:35,729
As you can see...

344
00:31:35,979 --> 00:31:39,441
It lies between Place de la Concorde
and the Louvre.

345
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:47,240
Catherine of Medici built
the Tuileries Palace in 1564.

346
00:31:47,574 --> 00:31:50,035
France's famous cultural hub.

347
00:31:50,869 --> 00:31:53,204
It became a public garden after
the French revolution.

348
00:31:53,538 --> 00:31:55,248
It's a very famous tourist spot.

349
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:56,541
Wow.

350
00:31:59,878 --> 00:32:00,878
Slow down!

351
00:32:03,715 --> 00:32:04,715
Love it!

352
00:32:06,509 --> 00:32:08,595
- This is the Arc de Triomphe.
- Paris's India Gate.

353
00:32:09,012 --> 00:32:10,638
This is one of the
most important lanes.

354
00:32:11,056 --> 00:32:13,725
- Home to many celebs.
- Like Delhi's Vasant Vihar.

355
00:32:14,225 --> 00:32:17,687
The Notre Dame, the world's
most famous cathedral.

356
00:32:18,355 --> 00:32:19,355
Wow!

357
00:32:19,481 --> 00:32:22,359
There's a beautiful story
about the Notre Dame.

358
00:32:22,692 --> 00:32:25,111
A beautiful story.

359
00:32:25,904 --> 00:32:28,490
The love story of Esmeralda
and Quasimodo.

360
00:32:29,366 --> 00:32:30,533
Beautiful.

361
00:32:34,037 --> 00:32:35,330
Happy honeymoon.

362
00:32:36,915 --> 00:32:37,916
Thank you.

363
00:32:39,209 --> 00:32:41,628
I'll be off, auntie. See you!
Lovely.

364
00:32:43,505 --> 00:32:44,505
Bye!

365
00:32:46,883 --> 00:32:47,967
Hello, hello.

366
00:32:50,011 --> 00:32:51,680
Is our meeting a random event?

367
00:32:51,971 --> 00:32:55,392
Or is God trying to unite lovers
who were made for each other?

368
00:32:56,101 --> 00:32:58,478
You honestly didn't know
I worked here?

369
00:32:58,978 --> 00:33:00,480
How the hell would I know!

370
00:33:01,147 --> 00:33:03,692
We're not in India where
two people can get lost...

371
00:33:04,067 --> 00:33:05,276
and never meet again.

372
00:33:10,949 --> 00:33:16,246
Actually, I begged barman
François to lead me to you.

373
00:33:19,165 --> 00:33:23,920
You're forever blurting out the truth.
It makes you seem cute.

374
00:33:24,546 --> 00:33:25,588
But I am cute.

375
00:33:26,089 --> 00:33:28,883
Try your cuteness elsewhere.
I'm not in that headspace.

376
00:33:29,175 --> 00:33:31,594
Not looking for any space
in your head.

377
00:33:31,928 --> 00:33:35,348
Just one night, some drinks,
some dancing, some...

378
00:33:38,226 --> 00:33:40,437
No! You'll fall in love with me.
It'll get complicated.

379
00:33:40,729 --> 00:33:42,105
Are you crazy?

380
00:33:42,439 --> 00:33:46,234
Beyond me why people fall into
the love trap. Total time waste.

381
00:33:46,818 --> 00:33:48,194
Don't be a bore.

382
00:33:48,528 --> 00:33:49,528
One night...

383
00:33:49,696 --> 00:33:52,699
If you don't have a good time, I won't
show my face again. Promise!

384
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:00,915
- Ok.
- Ok.

385
00:34:02,751 --> 00:34:04,294
See that cop?

386
00:34:05,045 --> 00:34:06,045
Yeah.

387
00:34:06,463 --> 00:34:10,216
Slap him hard. I'll go out
on a date with you.

388
00:34:12,844 --> 00:34:16,681
You don't want to date me, it's ok.
But I'm no suicide bomber.

389
00:34:17,515 --> 00:34:20,769
I want to date you. But are you
worth my time?

390
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:24,314
He's a bloody cop. I'll get deported.

391
00:34:24,898 --> 00:34:26,816
Life's a bitch.

392
00:34:33,615 --> 00:34:35,200
You're psycho, right?

393
00:34:52,634 --> 00:34:55,136
If I die, I won't spare you.

394
00:35:21,162 --> 00:35:22,372
Run!

395
00:36:56,132 --> 00:36:57,801
Carefree hearts fly free.

396
00:37:00,428 --> 00:37:01,846
Like sparks rising from embers.

397
00:37:13,983 --> 00:37:15,276
Swinging all night long.

398
00:37:16,319 --> 00:37:18,029
Touching the blue sky.

399
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:19,864
Kissing the moon.

400
00:37:20,365 --> 00:37:21,908
Circling the stars.

401
00:37:23,034 --> 00:37:24,828
Carefree hearts fly free.

402
00:37:27,414 --> 00:37:28,832
Like sparks rising from embers.

403
00:37:52,022 --> 00:37:53,815
Hearts beating.

404
00:37:54,024 --> 00:37:55,400
Pulse racing - breathless.

405
00:37:56,359 --> 00:37:58,028
Eyes sparkling when they meet.

406
00:38:01,031 --> 00:38:02,866
Faltering, fluttering.

407
00:38:03,241 --> 00:38:04,909
Fumbling - breathless.

408
00:38:05,493 --> 00:38:07,370
Hands trembling when they meet.

409
00:38:10,373 --> 00:38:11,750
Rolling the dice.

410
00:38:12,334 --> 00:38:13,585
Gambling with hearts.

411
00:38:14,711 --> 00:38:15,837
Rolling the dice.

412
00:38:16,588 --> 00:38:18,131
Gambling with hearts.

413
00:38:19,174 --> 00:38:20,967
Carefree hearts fly free.

414
00:38:23,595 --> 00:38:25,055
Like sparks rising from embers.

415
00:38:45,992 --> 00:38:48,787
There's no holding them back.

416
00:38:50,413 --> 00:38:52,415
They swim in the deep end.

417
00:38:55,001 --> 00:38:57,671
Caring not if they win or lose.

418
00:38:59,506 --> 00:39:01,508
Caring not if they sink or swim.

419
00:39:04,094 --> 00:39:05,970
Reigning in emotions...

420
00:39:06,471 --> 00:39:07,847
is chasing clouds.

421
00:39:08,723 --> 00:39:10,475
Desires are the whims of souls.

422
00:39:13,311 --> 00:39:15,021
Carefree hearts fly free.

423
00:39:17,482 --> 00:39:18,942
Like sparks rising from embers.

424
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:09,700
Look, son...

425
00:40:10,243 --> 00:40:14,080
We know what it means if a daughter
brings a boy home. Parents know.

426
00:40:15,707 --> 00:40:17,709
She knows all about
Shyra's boyfriends.

427
00:40:18,168 --> 00:40:21,129
We don't question her. This is
Paris after all, not Patiala.

428
00:40:24,132 --> 00:40:25,884
Son, are your parents in Delhi?

429
00:40:26,176 --> 00:40:29,637
Auntie, Mum's a housewife,
Dad was in the army.

430
00:40:30,221 --> 00:40:31,306
I'm so sorry, son.

431
00:40:36,186 --> 00:40:42,025
Why not call your mother?
Let's fix the wedding date.

432
00:40:43,526 --> 00:40:45,445
Relax, Mum. He's not proposing.

433
00:40:45,737 --> 00:40:46,737
Then?

434
00:40:46,988 --> 00:40:48,490
He's helping me to move out.

435
00:40:48,823 --> 00:40:50,450
Moving out? Where to?

436
00:40:50,909 --> 00:40:52,869
- Are you leaving Paris?
- No.

437
00:40:53,244 --> 00:40:55,830
Dharam and I have so little
time together.

438
00:40:56,164 --> 00:40:59,209
He has his stand-up at nights,
and I work all day.

439
00:40:59,584 --> 00:41:02,212
His roommates are moving out.
It's just more practical.

440
00:41:02,712 --> 00:41:03,712
All good?

441
00:41:03,922 --> 00:41:04,922
Meaning?

442
00:41:05,382 --> 00:41:08,301
You'll live together? Out of wedlock?

443
00:41:08,677 --> 00:41:10,470
Auntie, you see...

444
00:41:11,012 --> 00:41:15,016
if we live together, we'll find out
if we're a good fit.

445
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:19,479
She's my daughter,
not a free yoga class.

446
00:41:20,063 --> 00:41:23,108
Papa, I'm not asking for permission,
I'm just letting you know.

447
00:41:23,525 --> 00:41:26,111
No scenes. We're 10 mins away.

448
00:41:26,444 --> 00:41:29,698
It's not like a marriage,
just a live-in.

449
00:41:34,411 --> 00:41:35,829
I think we better go.

450
00:41:48,383 --> 00:41:49,759
Just a live-in?

451
00:41:50,552 --> 00:41:51,803
Bless me, uncle.

452
00:41:53,638 --> 00:41:54,889
Bless me, auntie.

453
00:41:57,142 --> 00:41:58,810
Paying respect? In Paris?

454
00:42:04,524 --> 00:42:06,151
Why did you touch their feet?

455
00:42:07,193 --> 00:42:11,031
Didn't want them to think you're
living with a jerk.

456
00:42:11,281 --> 00:42:13,033
Had to reassure them.

457
00:42:13,283 --> 00:42:16,161
You overdid it. Now they're waiting
for the wedding.

458
00:42:16,536 --> 00:42:18,663
Can you blame them?

459
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:22,167
Living with a guy for the first time,
it's a biggish deal.

460
00:42:22,917 --> 00:42:24,919
We're never getting married.
Ever.

461
00:42:25,253 --> 00:42:26,671
I know! Relax.

462
00:42:27,213 --> 00:42:28,840
Think I'm dying to get married?

463
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:31,843
Stop the car!

464
00:42:32,302 --> 00:42:33,636
Stop the car. On the side.

465
00:42:40,935 --> 00:42:43,480
- In the middle of the road...
- Shut up!

466
00:42:44,397 --> 00:42:46,399
- We want to live together?
- Absolutely!

467
00:42:46,733 --> 00:42:48,443
Are we an uncool couple...

468
00:42:48,818 --> 00:42:51,154
who call each other silly names
- honey, sweetie?

469
00:42:51,446 --> 00:42:52,030
Never!

470
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:54,449
Why won't we say silly things
like "I love you?"

471
00:42:54,741 --> 00:42:57,369
'Cos it turns all emotional,
sentimental. End of fun times.

472
00:42:58,203 --> 00:42:59,204
Perfect.

473
00:43:00,914 --> 00:43:01,956
Let's move in.

474
00:43:03,083 --> 00:43:04,083
I dare you!

475
00:43:04,501 --> 00:43:05,501
Now.

476
00:43:05,919 --> 00:43:07,837
Right now, right here.

477
00:43:14,928 --> 00:43:15,929
You're on!

478
00:43:28,483 --> 00:43:29,526
Dharam!

479
00:43:32,153 --> 00:43:34,239
Dharam! Open the door.

480
00:43:34,823 --> 00:43:36,991
Where's the fire? My game...

481
00:43:38,952 --> 00:43:40,995
It stinks! Oh my God.

482
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:53,466
- What is it? The lights?
- Where's my charger?

483
00:43:54,009 --> 00:43:55,927
Lights off! I've an early start.

484
00:43:56,261 --> 00:43:58,304
Bloody lights off! Damn it.

485
00:43:58,805 --> 00:44:01,057
- Are you insane?
- You're too much!

486
00:44:01,391 --> 00:44:02,559
Shyra, get up, help me.

487
00:44:03,476 --> 00:44:05,812
The cleaner has the same phone.
She took it.

488
00:44:08,148 --> 00:44:09,149
Who's that?

489
00:44:10,734 --> 00:44:11,860
What are you doing?

490
00:44:13,653 --> 00:44:16,740
Shut that music!
I came home at 3.

491
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:20,243
Is this revenge for the other night?
So immature.

492
00:44:21,536 --> 00:44:23,121
Music off! Or else...

493
00:44:23,496 --> 00:44:24,831
You evil witch!

494
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:26,708
Good morning!

495
00:44:29,336 --> 00:44:31,171
I hope you have a crap day!

496
00:44:32,255 --> 00:44:33,506
- The keys?
- You had them.

497
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:35,967
You're kidding me?
The house keys?

498
00:44:36,676 --> 00:44:41,014
- Look at the size of this bag.
- Do I have the keys at night?

499
00:44:42,599 --> 00:44:44,309
You know what, just check it.

500
00:44:44,768 --> 00:44:46,019
Let's check it.

501
00:44:49,272 --> 00:44:51,316
- Shut up!
- You shut up.

502
00:44:58,823 --> 00:45:00,367
Honey, I'm home.

503
00:45:00,867 --> 00:45:04,120
Mehra took me to a great place.
We ate like pigs.

504
00:45:04,704 --> 00:45:07,207
Have an acidity attack.
Expecting guests?

505
00:45:07,665 --> 00:45:10,835
- I told you I was cooking tonight.
- Wasn't that on Thursday?

506
00:45:12,879 --> 00:45:14,047
Today is Thursday.

507
00:45:45,829 --> 00:45:46,829
Yeah?

508
00:45:46,913 --> 00:45:49,040
Hi! You well? All good?

509
00:45:49,582 --> 00:45:52,293
Mummy, Papa doing well?
Sorry. Am I disturbing?

510
00:45:53,003 --> 00:45:56,006
Didn't I say? Politeness
doesn't suit you. What's up?

511
00:45:56,965 --> 00:45:58,174
I'm at the police station.

512
00:46:00,301 --> 00:46:04,431
Mehra is in Delhi. Who could I call
but you?

513
00:46:04,973 --> 00:46:06,850
- Which station?
- Place Dauphine.

514
00:46:07,642 --> 00:46:08,685
Coming.

515
00:46:09,185 --> 00:46:11,563
Could you bring 500 euros?

516
00:46:15,608 --> 00:46:17,569
Money coming! 10 minutes.

517
00:46:22,907 --> 00:46:24,117
Don't hit me.

518
00:46:26,411 --> 00:46:29,748
- Is that it? Can we go?
- Yes. You can go.

519
00:46:30,206 --> 00:46:31,875
Very well. Thank you.

520
00:46:32,375 --> 00:46:34,919
I paid the fine. Collect
your car tomorrow.

521
00:46:36,254 --> 00:46:38,340
See you tomorrow. The car...

522
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:41,051
Merci. No thanks?

523
00:46:46,097 --> 00:46:47,223
Thanks.

524
00:46:48,558 --> 00:46:50,352
I'll return your money tomorrow.

525
00:46:51,644 --> 00:46:55,648
If they catch you driving drunk
again, licence cancelled.

526
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:56,941
I know.

527
00:46:59,694 --> 00:47:01,321
How come your wallet was stolen?

528
00:47:04,699 --> 00:47:07,577
My date ran away with it.

529
00:47:11,122 --> 00:47:14,167
- She just left with your wallet?
- Yeah.

530
00:47:26,888 --> 00:47:29,641
- Oh God, Dharam, you're unbelievable.
- She was classy and hot.

531
00:47:30,141 --> 00:47:31,351
She didn't look a criminal.

532
00:47:36,314 --> 00:47:38,817
How come you're all alone
on a Saturday night?

533
00:47:39,609 --> 00:47:40,609
Just...

534
00:47:40,944 --> 00:47:44,364
I am enjoying being on my own
these days.

535
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:46,574
No boyfriend?

536
00:47:47,826 --> 00:47:49,244
What can I do, Dharma?

537
00:47:49,661 --> 00:47:52,414
Since you left, my heart
beats for no one.

538
00:47:52,706 --> 00:47:54,791
But I have a new girlfriend
every week.

539
00:47:55,083 --> 00:47:56,083
Is that so?

540
00:47:56,376 --> 00:47:58,086
You started much later than me.

541
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:02,007
You need a lot of catching up
to become a slut like me.

542
00:48:07,887 --> 00:48:09,180
I'm sorry, Shyra.

543
00:48:11,266 --> 00:48:14,894
I shouldn't have said all that stuff
the day we broke up.

544
00:48:16,813 --> 00:48:19,941
I was judging you 'cos
I lacked experience.

545
00:48:20,275 --> 00:48:21,568
Totally uncool.

546
00:48:24,112 --> 00:48:27,532
I wanted to apologise right away.
But I was so mad.

547
00:48:29,159 --> 00:48:30,326
I'm sorry.

548
00:48:31,870 --> 00:48:33,204
Forgive me.

549
00:48:42,047 --> 00:48:44,132
When did you grow up, Dharma?

550
00:48:44,841 --> 00:48:46,968
The day you left me, Ma!

551
00:48:49,721 --> 00:48:52,766
Since you left, I haven't peed
with the toilet seat up.

552
00:48:53,224 --> 00:48:55,935
The remotes are in one place.
I wash up before I sleep.

553
00:48:56,186 --> 00:48:57,562
Make the bed every day.

554
00:48:57,812 --> 00:49:00,398
And there's not a single empty
milk carton in the fridge.

555
00:49:00,815 --> 00:49:01,815
Wow!

556
00:49:03,234 --> 00:49:05,111
- Should I come back?
- Come.

557
00:49:07,030 --> 00:49:08,114
I dare you!

558
00:49:16,122 --> 00:49:19,167
Actually, you know what.
Breaking up has reformed us.

559
00:49:19,668 --> 00:49:22,295
You've learned how to say sorry,
I've stopped partying.

560
00:49:22,629 --> 00:49:24,798
At least something good has
come out of it.

561
00:49:25,507 --> 00:49:28,551
But you gotta admit,
it was fun while it lasted.

562
00:49:29,636 --> 00:49:30,679
Too much fun.

563
00:49:31,346 --> 00:49:32,346
Shyra?

564
00:49:33,223 --> 00:49:36,101
Hi, Mum. Hi, Papa.
Late night at the restaurant?

565
00:49:36,434 --> 00:49:38,478
Bless me, uncle.

566
00:49:39,437 --> 00:49:41,690
Bless me, auntie.

567
00:49:43,108 --> 00:49:44,108
Good night.

568
00:49:44,734 --> 00:49:45,777
Thank you.

569
00:49:47,737 --> 00:49:50,198
Are you back together?

570
00:49:50,615 --> 00:49:51,616
No, Mum.

571
00:49:53,576 --> 00:49:57,038
Modern relationships! You're too old
to get it. Don't stress.

572
00:49:57,414 --> 00:49:58,498
Let's go in.

573
00:50:14,014 --> 00:50:15,015
So, Jasmine!

574
00:50:15,682 --> 00:50:19,477
I tried dating you for a year,
how come I got lucky today?

575
00:50:21,479 --> 00:50:24,107
'Cos my boyfriend is a
cheating moron.

576
00:50:25,108 --> 00:50:27,152
Today's my birthday.
My turn to cheat.

577
00:50:28,695 --> 00:50:30,864
I chose you 'cos you're frivolous.

578
00:50:31,239 --> 00:50:32,824
You're cool with this, right?

579
00:50:33,533 --> 00:50:34,533
Right, right.

580
00:50:35,910 --> 00:50:38,163
So happy freaking birthday to me!

581
00:50:41,708 --> 00:50:42,708
One more.

582
00:50:44,461 --> 00:50:45,587
Your moron?

583
00:50:46,087 --> 00:50:47,380
For the 100th time.

584
00:50:48,089 --> 00:50:51,051
- No way am I taking him back.
- Absolutely not. Why should you?

585
00:50:52,344 --> 00:50:56,056
11th December? Sagittarian?

586
00:50:56,890 --> 00:50:58,975
My first Delhi girlfriend
was a Sagitt...

587
00:51:01,561 --> 00:51:02,812
Is today the eleventh?

588
00:51:03,772 --> 00:51:06,107
May I borrow your phone?
Urgent call.

589
00:51:16,826 --> 00:51:18,953
- Hello.
- Today is the 11th.

590
00:51:19,913 --> 00:51:21,289
Whose cell is that?

591
00:51:21,581 --> 00:51:23,583
Long story, not important.
December 11, remember?

592
00:51:24,793 --> 00:51:27,003
I remember 9/11.
What's with 12/11?

593
00:51:27,379 --> 00:51:30,048
A bigger crisis than 9/11...
our breakup.

594
00:51:31,716 --> 00:51:33,176
You called to tell me this?

595
00:51:33,468 --> 00:51:35,553
C'mon, Shyra, it's our breakup
anniversary.

596
00:51:35,887 --> 00:51:38,348
People celebrate birthdays,
wedding anniversaries...

597
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:40,517
so can't we celebrate our breakup?

598
00:51:41,142 --> 00:51:43,353
I really don't have time
for this stupidity.

599
00:51:43,728 --> 00:51:45,313
I am on the night shift.

600
00:51:45,730 --> 00:51:49,067
You finish at 9.30. See you
at the Pont des Arts at 10.

601
00:51:49,526 --> 00:51:50,526
No way.

602
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:54,072
Are you scared? Still haunted
by flashbacks of me?

603
00:51:54,572 --> 00:51:55,865
You wish!

604
00:51:56,324 --> 00:51:57,826
I've an early start. Must go.

605
00:51:57,992 --> 00:51:59,035
Dare you!

606
00:52:04,582 --> 00:52:05,875
I'll see you at 10.

607
00:52:12,590 --> 00:52:15,385
All right, people.
Trocadero is to your left.

608
00:52:15,635 --> 00:52:18,346
If anyone wants a selfie,
move to this side.

609
00:52:22,475 --> 00:52:23,475
Hello. Sidharth?

610
00:52:24,019 --> 00:52:27,230
Jasmine is at the Pink Flamingos,
bawling her eyes out for you.

611
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:28,940
Get over here now.

612
00:52:29,441 --> 00:52:31,651
Me? I'm your lucky charm.

613
00:52:46,958 --> 00:52:50,503
- What's this new drama, Dharam?
- No drama, just a goodbye.

614
00:52:51,463 --> 00:52:53,381
We were together for a year.

615
00:52:54,007 --> 00:52:56,343
Ours was a Titanic - type love story.

616
00:52:57,052 --> 00:53:01,890
But the end was bad Bollywood.
Hasty, imperfect.

617
00:53:02,766 --> 00:53:05,352
Now that we've both moved on...

618
00:53:06,394 --> 00:53:07,437
You have, right?

619
00:53:07,812 --> 00:53:10,440
Or do you still have the hots for me?

620
00:53:12,942 --> 00:53:16,613
To celebrate the joy of
moving on, here we are...

621
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:19,741
a year later, saying 'bye
in style.

622
00:53:20,116 --> 00:53:22,619
Let's celebrate our breakup
anniversary.

623
00:53:22,994 --> 00:53:24,079
Damn it!

624
00:53:26,956 --> 00:53:27,956
What's the plan?

625
00:53:28,124 --> 00:53:30,043
- Whatever you want.
- That's a first.

626
00:53:30,293 --> 00:53:32,671
You said that I've grown up now.

627
00:53:33,672 --> 00:53:35,382
- Shall we go to Montmartre?
- No.

628
00:53:35,882 --> 00:53:38,093
The soft breeze, the stars,
the silent night...

629
00:53:38,510 --> 00:53:41,805
then you'll bore me with
your life's woes. Can't do it.

630
00:53:42,347 --> 00:53:43,867
There's a new nightclub in the Marais.

631
00:53:44,265 --> 00:53:45,265
A nightclub?

632
00:53:45,392 --> 00:53:47,811
You'll get drunk on vodka,
dance on the table...

633
00:53:48,103 --> 00:53:50,188
start a brawl and then
we'll get kicked out.

634
00:53:50,522 --> 00:53:53,441
You've got a point. Drive to Lyon?

635
00:53:53,942 --> 00:53:58,071
I was driving all day. Besides,
only one of us can drink.

636
00:53:58,321 --> 00:54:03,118
Oh no! Today we have a drinking
contest. Long drive cancelled.

637
00:54:03,868 --> 00:54:05,787
Want to see Salman's new film
at the Metro?

638
00:54:07,122 --> 00:54:09,749
I've seen enough Hindi films
to please you.

639
00:54:10,125 --> 00:54:14,129
Now that I'm your ex, I can pass on
those macho stunts.

640
00:54:14,421 --> 00:54:17,132
Ok. Let's see something French
and artsy.

641
00:54:17,507 --> 00:54:19,592
The last time you got worked up
in the sex scenes.

642
00:54:19,843 --> 00:54:21,594
Can't do that now.

643
00:54:21,970 --> 00:54:23,972
- I don't trust you.
- I don't trust me either.

644
00:54:24,514 --> 00:54:26,349
Let's hang out in your
favourite park.

645
00:54:27,142 --> 00:54:29,978
There'll be couples making out
everywhere. We'd look like fools.

646
00:54:30,478 --> 00:54:33,606
Is there no place in Paris where
we can chat...

647
00:54:33,815 --> 00:54:36,192
peacefully without romancing?

648
00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:41,823
- Have we grown old?
- You sure have. A little.

649
00:54:43,116 --> 00:54:44,159
Very funny.

650
00:54:44,826 --> 00:54:46,995
So basically there's nothing
we can do together.

651
00:54:47,328 --> 00:54:50,331
Or have we done everything already?

652
00:54:52,584 --> 00:54:55,378
- We parted at the perfect time.
- Perfect.

653
00:54:58,006 --> 00:55:00,133
Your breakup anniversary
is a bad flop.

654
00:55:00,342 --> 00:55:01,384
No way!

655
00:55:06,806 --> 00:55:07,891
I'll be right back.

656
00:55:09,517 --> 00:55:11,353
You won't leave?

657
00:55:12,103 --> 00:55:14,272
I've already left. Forgotten?

658
00:55:27,243 --> 00:55:28,243
Will you marry me?

659
00:55:31,623 --> 00:55:33,333
Yes, you moron.

660
00:55:53,186 --> 00:55:55,438
One thing we haven't done together.

661
00:55:55,814 --> 00:55:57,065
Drink beer?

662
00:55:58,733 --> 00:56:00,235
- Padlocks are for lovers.
- I know.

663
00:56:00,443 --> 00:56:01,778
They're banned here.

664
00:56:02,028 --> 00:56:03,738
Do we the carefree
bother about bans?

665
00:56:04,030 --> 00:56:06,324
No way! I was in jail once,
thanks to you.

666
00:56:06,658 --> 00:56:08,118
- Enough.
- Listen.

667
00:56:08,576 --> 00:56:10,495
This bridge was witness
to the start of love.

668
00:56:10,912 --> 00:56:13,456
Today it will see an end.

669
00:56:14,082 --> 00:56:17,961
Let's clip the padlock to the bridge,
throw the key in the Seine...

670
00:56:18,378 --> 00:56:22,048
and promise never to fall
in love with each other again.

671
00:56:22,424 --> 00:56:23,466
Good idea?

672
00:56:24,509 --> 00:56:26,845
The boy is older and smarter.

673
00:56:28,013 --> 00:56:29,931
- Let's do it.
- Let's do it!

674
00:56:30,515 --> 00:56:31,891
Lock. Yeah!

675
00:56:35,603 --> 00:56:36,603
Look at that.

676
00:56:38,398 --> 00:56:40,400
- There!
- My master.

677
00:56:41,401 --> 00:56:42,401
Bless you.

678
00:56:45,613 --> 00:56:48,074
Congrats on your breakup!

679
00:56:53,997 --> 00:56:56,124
Miss Shyra Gill...

680
00:56:57,292 --> 00:56:59,336
why did our love story flop?

681
00:56:59,794 --> 00:57:04,215
Because it wasn't a love story,
it was a lust story.

682
00:57:06,134 --> 00:57:09,220
You mean we were lovers of lust?

683
00:57:09,971 --> 00:57:10,971
Exactly!

684
00:57:11,848 --> 00:57:15,477
We were in lust. But we mistook it
for love.

685
00:57:16,061 --> 00:57:20,231
Before we got to know each other,
we started bickering about nothing.

686
00:57:20,815 --> 00:57:24,986
If we were friends first, we'd be
more forgiving of our flaws.

687
00:57:25,487 --> 00:57:30,075
Then our love would have
had a better chance.

688
00:57:33,411 --> 00:57:34,704
So what are we now?

689
00:57:35,580 --> 00:57:37,624
I mean, we're not lovers?

690
00:57:39,209 --> 00:57:40,209
Not enemies?

691
00:57:42,045 --> 00:57:44,089
So, who am I to you?

692
00:57:47,133 --> 00:57:49,386
I think now we're friends.

693
00:57:52,722 --> 00:57:53,807
Friends?

694
00:57:55,517 --> 00:57:56,518
You mean...

695
00:57:57,352 --> 00:57:59,979
So I'm my ex-girlfriend's
friend?

696
00:58:03,483 --> 00:58:05,026
You made me French finally.

697
00:58:05,985 --> 00:58:08,822
Ok, Mr Frenchy, let's see what
you've got.

698
00:58:09,572 --> 00:58:10,572
Come on.

699
00:58:57,912 --> 00:58:59,998
Wet shoes flung about.

700
00:59:00,248 --> 00:59:02,042
It's you and me.

701
00:59:03,043 --> 00:59:05,045
No coffee in the coffee jar.

702
00:59:05,295 --> 00:59:07,047
It's you and me.

703
00:59:08,048 --> 00:59:10,175
That silly umbrella never opens.

704
00:59:10,717 --> 00:59:12,344
It's you and me.

705
00:59:13,428 --> 00:59:17,223
That window never closes.
It's you and me.

706
00:59:17,849 --> 00:59:22,020
Our life is topsy-turvy
like our friendship.

707
00:59:22,937 --> 00:59:27,233
Upside down but seems
right side up.

708
00:59:28,401 --> 00:59:30,362
We shop and no taxi in sight.

709
00:59:30,653 --> 00:59:32,030
It's you and me.

710
00:59:33,531 --> 00:59:37,494
We walk, shoe strap snaps.
It's you and me.

711
00:59:38,661 --> 00:59:42,082
The traffic is at standstill.
It's you and me.

712
00:59:43,708 --> 00:59:46,336
The bus takes ages to show.

713
00:59:47,337 --> 00:59:48,630
You and me.

714
01:00:09,109 --> 01:00:11,611
When the path ahead
seems thorny...

715
01:00:12,946 --> 01:00:15,365
or changes shape and size...

716
01:00:16,408 --> 01:00:18,410
or feels just like a swamp.

717
01:00:19,285 --> 01:00:20,328
Smile!

718
01:00:20,620 --> 01:00:24,666
Spread your arms wide,
breathe in the fresh air.

719
01:00:26,584 --> 01:00:28,128
It's free!

720
01:00:30,130 --> 01:00:33,800
Wandering sailors, lost mariners...

721
01:00:35,135 --> 01:00:38,722
ever-ready to sail the rough seas,
turning the tide as we go.

722
01:00:40,223 --> 01:00:41,808
A little nuts,

723
01:00:42,809 --> 01:00:44,519
a little wise,

724
01:00:45,311 --> 01:00:46,855
we're old-time sinners,

725
01:00:47,355 --> 01:00:48,565
lovers of life.

726
01:00:49,816 --> 01:00:51,818
Stumbling along the path.

727
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:54,029
It's you and me.

728
01:00:54,946 --> 01:00:58,700
Smiling through life.
It's you and me.

729
01:00:59,993 --> 01:01:01,911
Frozen and melting.

730
01:01:02,287 --> 01:01:04,205
It's you and me.

731
01:01:05,123 --> 01:01:06,791
Done and undone.

732
01:01:07,334 --> 01:01:09,127
It's you and me.

733
01:01:09,878 --> 01:01:13,923
Our life is topsy-turvy
like our friendship.

734
01:01:14,841 --> 01:01:18,762
Upside down but seems
right side up.

735
01:01:48,833 --> 01:01:50,001
- Yeah?
- What's up?

736
01:01:50,293 --> 01:01:51,293
Getting ready.

737
01:01:51,378 --> 01:01:54,089
- Meet me downstairs.
- Where are we going?

738
01:01:54,798 --> 01:01:57,384
It's Friday night, babe!
Deadpool 2 released today.

739
01:01:57,967 --> 01:01:59,636
I completely forgot.

740
01:02:00,804 --> 01:02:02,555
So why were you dolling up?

741
01:02:03,139 --> 01:02:04,139
I have a date.

742
01:02:04,557 --> 01:02:05,557
You have a... what?

743
01:02:05,975 --> 01:02:08,478
Kim's idea. He works in her office.

744
01:02:08,853 --> 01:02:11,815
I finally agreed. Why not?

745
01:02:12,357 --> 01:02:16,069
Hell, no! Shyra, who can I go with?
Make an excuse and cancel.

746
01:02:16,695 --> 01:02:20,532
I'm not in the mood, but if
I cancel now, it'd be rude.

747
01:02:21,199 --> 01:02:23,702
You had to chose tonight to go
on a date.

748
01:02:23,952 --> 01:02:25,036
Who's the loser?

749
01:02:25,245 --> 01:02:27,664
He's not a loser. A hotshot
investment banker.

750
01:02:27,914 --> 01:02:29,666
If he's dating you,
he gotta be a loser.

751
01:02:29,916 --> 01:02:31,876
He'll bore you to bits.

752
01:02:32,252 --> 01:02:34,587
He works at Citibank. Kim's boss.

753
01:02:34,879 --> 01:02:36,214
She thinks he's perfect for me.

754
01:02:36,548 --> 01:02:38,188
Have a glass of wine
and send him packing.

755
01:02:39,884 --> 01:02:42,470
- I was silly saying yes.
- Think community service.

756
01:02:43,013 --> 01:02:45,265
Take him to a bar. I'll call you
in 10 minutes.

757
01:02:45,557 --> 01:02:49,144
Say there's an emergency, a friend
is in hospital. Bye bye banker.

758
01:02:49,519 --> 01:02:53,398
Not a bad idea. Where will you be?
What if he sees you?

759
01:02:53,690 --> 01:02:55,817
Ms Dumbo, how will he know me?
I'll be at the bar.

760
01:02:57,944 --> 01:02:59,529
- He's here.
- No, it's me.

761
01:03:02,157 --> 01:03:03,157
Bonsoir!

762
01:03:03,742 --> 01:03:04,742
Bonsoir!

763
01:03:06,661 --> 01:03:08,288
No laundry today, thanks.

764
01:03:08,663 --> 01:03:10,040
Give me two minutes.

765
01:03:11,124 --> 01:03:12,124
Hi!

766
01:03:14,919 --> 01:03:17,255
- Where to?
- Wherever. It's only for one drink.

767
01:03:17,630 --> 01:03:19,758
In fact, I can't have a late night
either.

768
01:03:20,175 --> 01:03:21,551
Have an early start.

769
01:03:22,093 --> 01:03:26,097
And you might get a call from
a friend. Hospital... emergency.

770
01:03:29,184 --> 01:03:33,063
- Ok, bye. I'll see you guys later.
- Aren't you coming with us?

771
01:03:33,355 --> 01:03:36,691
- It's Friday. I'm fasting.
- Think community service.

772
01:03:37,859 --> 01:03:41,696
Guys, relax, it's cool.
I'm Anay, the boring banker.

773
01:03:42,655 --> 01:03:43,698
I'm sorry.

774
01:03:44,616 --> 01:03:45,616
"Sorry?"

775
01:03:45,784 --> 01:03:48,870
Never heard that name before.
Your parents must've thought hard.

776
01:03:49,829 --> 01:03:51,414
- Shyra.
- Hi, Shyra.

777
01:03:51,915 --> 01:03:52,915
Dharam.

778
01:03:53,208 --> 01:03:56,378
Call me whatever you want.
I deserve punishment.

779
01:03:56,795 --> 01:04:00,048
Your punishment? You'll party
with this boring banker.

780
01:04:00,465 --> 01:04:02,050
There's a karaoke bar in Belleville.

781
01:04:02,384 --> 01:04:04,719
A Bollywood night.
You guys sing well?

782
01:04:05,553 --> 01:04:06,553
No?

783
01:04:06,846 --> 01:04:09,307
Perfect. I'm a lousy singer too.
Let's go.

784
01:05:58,625 --> 01:06:00,335
Guys, guys, guys!

785
01:06:01,127 --> 01:06:02,128
That's me.

786
01:06:03,296 --> 01:06:05,674
- Don't go.
- Have to, man.

787
01:06:06,508 --> 01:06:08,385
Thank you so much. I had a blast.

788
01:06:08,843 --> 01:06:10,387
Brought back my college days.

789
01:06:12,472 --> 01:06:14,974
- It's lovely meeting you, Shyra.
- Ditto.

790
01:06:18,061 --> 01:06:20,855
Dharam, my brother!
You're a rock star.

791
01:06:21,189 --> 01:06:23,191
Sorry for screwing up your date.

792
01:06:23,483 --> 01:06:26,569
Thanks to you, I serenaded
a girl for the first time ever...

793
01:06:26,945 --> 01:06:30,615
and a lovely one, too. No date
could be as memorable.

794
01:06:31,282 --> 01:06:32,492
Thank you, my friend.

795
01:06:35,078 --> 01:06:36,287
Good night.

796
01:06:54,848 --> 01:06:56,307
He's not going to look back.

797
01:06:57,267 --> 01:06:59,352
Waiting for someone to look back
is so 90s.

798
01:06:59,728 --> 01:07:01,688
I was just checking out his ass.

799
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:03,480
Cute, no?

800
01:07:04,482 --> 01:07:05,483
Really?

801
01:07:08,236 --> 01:07:10,488
I partied after a year. I had a blast.

802
01:07:10,989 --> 01:07:12,532
The banker is a cool guy.

803
01:07:12,907 --> 01:07:15,452
Cool, decent and fun.
A rare combination.

804
01:07:16,036 --> 01:07:17,328
Come to think of it,

805
01:07:17,787 --> 01:07:20,623
he's everything you
wanted me to be.

806
01:07:21,583 --> 01:07:22,751
Hook him!

807
01:07:23,543 --> 01:07:26,379
He was my date, but you're
the one swooning.

808
01:07:27,130 --> 01:07:30,550
Ok. You stay cool. But if he
throws you a line, grab it.

809
01:07:32,719 --> 01:07:35,013
I'm done with hooking up,
breaking up.

810
01:07:35,638 --> 01:07:39,351
I want to stop. Be still.
Stay in one place.

811
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:42,103
You're scaring me.

812
01:07:43,688 --> 01:07:47,776
I'm scared too. I feel as though
I've finally grown up.

813
01:07:49,319 --> 01:07:51,154
Don't want to be stupid anymore.

814
01:07:52,739 --> 01:07:55,033
So when will I get this
"grown up" feeling?

815
01:07:57,327 --> 01:08:00,830
Not in this lifetime for sure.
But don't lose heart.

816
01:08:01,206 --> 01:08:04,626
Guys like you are assured a rebirth
to repent for all your sins.

817
01:08:05,001 --> 01:08:09,422
- You've sinned more than me, witch.
- But I paid up being with you.

818
01:08:10,006 --> 01:08:11,758
Now I get it.

819
01:08:12,717 --> 01:08:15,679
So all the boyfriends before me
were your "sins."

820
01:08:16,096 --> 01:08:19,974
And I, your "atonement."
Anay, your "reward."

821
01:08:20,433 --> 01:08:21,601
Exactly!

822
01:08:22,477 --> 01:08:23,687
I don't believe it.

823
01:08:24,479 --> 01:08:26,189
I'm your "atonement?"

824
01:08:26,690 --> 01:08:29,776
- That's worse than "sin."
- Get over it!

825
01:08:31,361 --> 01:08:34,531
Walk home alone.
Hope you're mugged.

826
01:08:37,534 --> 01:08:39,077
Shyra, wait!

827
01:08:43,164 --> 01:08:45,000
Bonjour. Paris Sidewalks.
Can I help you?

828
01:08:45,417 --> 01:08:47,460
May I speak to singer
Sunidhi Chauhan?

829
01:08:47,752 --> 01:08:48,253
Pardon?

830
01:08:48,586 --> 01:08:49,796
Singer Sonu Nigam here.

831
01:08:50,714 --> 01:08:51,714
Anay!

832
01:08:52,507 --> 01:08:54,467
You remember my name.
That's a good sign.

833
01:08:55,176 --> 01:08:57,012
I had a good time last night.

834
01:08:57,470 --> 01:08:59,973
Your pal Dharam is nuts. He's mad.

835
01:09:00,348 --> 01:09:02,267
He has a crush on you too.

836
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:05,311
If you want to avoid me,
give me his number...

837
01:09:05,895 --> 01:09:07,981
I'll try my luck with him.

838
01:09:09,816 --> 01:09:11,693
Seriously, Shyra, I really like you.

839
01:09:12,652 --> 01:09:16,448
If you don't think I'm an
avoidable boring banker,

840
01:09:17,615 --> 01:09:19,117
let me take you out next week.

841
01:09:21,661 --> 01:09:22,746
Next month?

842
01:09:24,122 --> 01:09:25,540
How about next year?

843
01:09:26,541 --> 01:09:27,541
Tonight?

844
01:09:31,129 --> 01:09:33,882
Tonight? I can't. I have a date.
I'm sorry.

845
01:09:36,217 --> 01:09:38,303
I'm kidding! Pick you up at 8.

846
01:09:39,220 --> 01:09:40,220
Ok.

847
01:09:50,482 --> 01:09:51,733
Off to Disneyland?

848
01:09:56,321 --> 01:09:58,406
Yes? Looks hot?

849
01:09:59,949 --> 01:10:00,949
Did someone die?

850
01:10:04,371 --> 01:10:05,455
Hello!

851
01:10:06,081 --> 01:10:08,291
Meeting in a restaurant?
Or booked a hotel room?

852
01:10:08,750 --> 01:10:10,919
- Idiot.
- Please change.

853
01:10:15,090 --> 01:10:16,090
Perfect!

854
01:10:19,886 --> 01:10:20,886
Enjoy!

855
01:10:45,704 --> 01:10:47,288
So, did you have sex?

856
01:10:47,580 --> 01:10:49,791
- Dharam, it was our first date.
- So what?

857
01:10:50,166 --> 01:10:52,419
On our first date you shook
the Eiffel Tower.

858
01:10:52,752 --> 01:10:56,089
- That's why we're just friends today.
- Oh, this is the forever guy.

859
01:10:56,548 --> 01:10:59,092
Is that why you're playing
goody-goody with Mr Banker?

860
01:11:00,468 --> 01:11:02,053
- Shut up.
- Did you kiss?

861
01:11:02,345 --> 01:11:04,431
He's a gentleman, not
a pervert like you.

862
01:11:04,723 --> 01:11:05,765
What a loser!

863
01:11:06,599 --> 01:11:09,811
So you just whispered
sweet nothings in his ear?

864
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:11,520
How sweet!

865
01:11:12,230 --> 01:11:13,857
You're giving me diabetes.

866
01:11:14,232 --> 01:11:15,275
Oh, get lost.

867
01:11:17,527 --> 01:11:21,156
The girl who fell into my cornflakes...

868
01:11:39,424 --> 01:11:43,178
Every time I go to the opera,
it feels like the first time.

869
01:11:43,470 --> 01:11:44,929
I can't explain it but...

870
01:11:45,597 --> 01:11:47,807
Am I boring you?

871
01:11:49,434 --> 01:11:52,437
Not at all. You know so much
about the opera.

872
01:11:52,771 --> 01:11:55,440
In fact, if you hadn't explained,
it would've bored me.

873
01:11:58,943 --> 01:12:00,320
I like you, Shyra.

874
01:12:03,782 --> 01:12:05,283
I really like you.

875
01:12:23,885 --> 01:12:26,680
So no kissy-wissy last night?

876
01:12:27,138 --> 01:12:28,138
No.

877
01:12:28,390 --> 01:12:30,475
I hope this banker isn't gay?

878
01:12:31,184 --> 01:12:32,936
You better find out.

879
01:12:33,353 --> 01:12:34,896
You're finally serious
about a guy...

880
01:12:35,188 --> 01:12:37,899
don't want you crying on
my shoulder, wetting my t-shirt.

881
01:12:38,316 --> 01:12:40,652
- He's not gay.
- How do you know?

882
01:12:42,153 --> 01:12:45,657
You would know. You have
a lifetime of experience.

883
01:12:47,158 --> 01:12:49,494
So it's the opera every Friday?

884
01:12:50,286 --> 01:12:52,914
What about our Friday movie night?
That's damn gay.

885
01:12:53,415 --> 01:12:54,874
That's very rude.

886
01:12:55,333 --> 01:12:59,337
- Not you! A movie? Friday night?
- Don't think so.

887
01:12:59,796 --> 01:13:00,922
You want ball?

888
01:13:27,157 --> 01:13:28,283
Anay, my man.

889
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:30,869
Dharam, my man. Am I disturbing?

890
01:13:31,536 --> 01:13:32,746
I have a rule.

891
01:13:33,413 --> 01:13:37,334
Never work so much that
a friend could disturb you.

892
01:13:37,959 --> 01:13:42,380
Nice. Need a favour. Can you
gatecrash my date again?

893
01:13:42,797 --> 01:13:45,800
Of course. That's my specialty.

894
01:13:46,801 --> 01:13:48,303
When and where?

895
01:13:49,220 --> 01:13:52,682
I have a yacht in Cannes. I'd like
Shyra to come for the weekend.

896
01:13:53,058 --> 01:13:56,561
Come with us, it'll be fun. And
Shyra will feel more comfortable.

897
01:13:57,187 --> 01:14:00,106
You must have a special friend.
Bring her too.

898
01:14:00,690 --> 01:14:01,983
Of course, of course.

899
01:14:02,317 --> 01:14:04,486
My special friend and I'll be there.

900
01:14:04,861 --> 01:14:07,489
Great! I'll text you the time
and place.

901
01:14:07,822 --> 01:14:09,157
Awesome!

902
01:14:10,658 --> 01:14:11,785
You like French music?

903
01:14:12,702 --> 01:14:15,038
I like French girls who like
French music.

904
01:15:27,485 --> 01:15:29,195
Baby, I love your skin.

905
01:15:29,696 --> 01:15:32,073
So nice and silky!

906
01:15:32,699 --> 01:15:35,368
You're French rasmalai.

907
01:15:35,910 --> 01:15:37,203
- You know "rasmalai?"
- No.

908
01:15:37,579 --> 01:15:39,289
Like mille-feuille.

909
01:15:51,718 --> 01:15:53,803
New bikini for new boyfriend?

910
01:15:54,596 --> 01:15:58,058
Your Miss Playboy is here, so I'd
better put up a good fight.

911
01:15:58,641 --> 01:15:59,641
Hot, no?

912
01:15:59,684 --> 01:16:02,771
- Do you ever talk or just...
- I have you for talking.

913
01:16:03,146 --> 01:16:03,813
Oh, yeah. Right.

914
01:16:04,105 --> 01:16:07,150
I have only one life.
Can't blow it talking.

915
01:16:07,609 --> 01:16:09,444
Guys, ice-lollies.

916
01:16:09,694 --> 01:16:10,779
Cool!

917
01:16:11,071 --> 01:16:12,405
Give me one.

918
01:16:14,407 --> 01:16:15,992
Baby, want an ice-lolly?

919
01:16:16,326 --> 01:16:18,745
I can't. I have a Vogue shoot
on Monday.

920
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:20,497
A Vogue shoot on Monday?

921
01:16:20,747 --> 01:16:23,833
Poor girl. She's a model.
I'll take both.

922
01:17:03,998 --> 01:17:08,003
- Come!
- I don't know how to swim, baby.

923
01:17:08,962 --> 01:17:12,215
Hey, Shyra. Can you please
explain to her in French?

924
01:17:12,590 --> 01:17:16,594
- Come on! It's only a Jet Ski.
- Dharam, I'll save you.

925
01:17:31,317 --> 01:17:32,317
Mama...

926
01:17:51,087 --> 01:17:53,506
I hope you're not bored
with the boring banker.

927
01:17:54,799 --> 01:17:56,718
'Cos the banker is bored stiff.

928
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:00,930
Good night, Shyra.

929
01:18:05,894 --> 01:18:07,103
I better go.

930
01:18:22,035 --> 01:18:23,787
Oh, what a gentleman.

931
01:18:25,955 --> 01:18:26,955
Round 2.

932
01:18:28,166 --> 01:18:29,668
What an idiot!

933
01:19:30,228 --> 01:19:33,648
"Shyra, please meet me at 8
at the top of the Eiffel Tower."

934
01:19:33,815 --> 01:19:35,358
"Something very important."

935
01:19:36,443 --> 01:19:38,653
"Wear that blue dress
I bought you. Please."

936
01:19:39,112 --> 01:19:40,447
"Love you. See you there."

937
01:20:37,337 --> 01:20:40,924
Shyra, I live in the modern world
but I'm old-fashioned.

938
01:20:41,466 --> 01:20:45,428
I follow the traditional path
when taking life decisions.

939
01:20:45,929 --> 01:20:50,141
Oxford-educated, work in an old
finance company and now...

940
01:20:51,768 --> 01:20:53,488
romancing at the top
of the Eiffel Tower.

941
01:20:54,479 --> 01:20:55,689
I know it's a cliché.

942
01:20:57,649 --> 01:20:58,983
But it's classic...

943
01:20:59,901 --> 01:21:02,862
and beautiful... just like you.

944
01:21:04,447 --> 01:21:08,576
I know it's the live-in age. Couples
try it out before the big leap.

945
01:21:09,703 --> 01:21:12,539
But I don't need time to choose
my life partner.

946
01:21:14,249 --> 01:21:18,586
I'm a banker, so I know a good
investment when I see one.

947
01:21:20,714 --> 01:21:22,507
So Miss Shyra Gill...

948
01:21:29,055 --> 01:21:30,306
will you marry me?

949
01:21:55,290 --> 01:21:56,332
WITCH.

950
01:22:00,795 --> 01:22:02,255
Can't talk, call tomorrow.

951
01:22:02,630 --> 01:22:04,507
Meet me at the Place des Vosges.

952
01:22:05,800 --> 01:22:10,847
Shyra, I'm in a highly sensitive
position right now. Can't leave.

953
01:22:11,222 --> 01:22:13,767
I don't care, Dharam Gulati.
15 minutes!

954
01:22:37,624 --> 01:22:41,002
If it's anything less than cancer,
I'll kill you myself.

955
01:22:41,419 --> 01:22:44,214
I sacrificed the hottest moment
of my life for you.

956
01:22:46,633 --> 01:22:50,303
- Anay has proposed to me.
- Proposed, as in...?

957
01:22:51,096 --> 01:22:52,430
Marriage?

958
01:23:07,195 --> 01:23:10,990
Do you think I'm a girl someone
can spend a lifetime with?

959
01:23:14,119 --> 01:23:16,287
I don't know why I'm asking you.

960
01:23:17,747 --> 01:23:20,792
No one has spent as much time
with me as you.

961
01:23:22,335 --> 01:23:24,546
Never lived with anyone else.

962
01:23:31,386 --> 01:23:34,347
Never felt scared getting into
a relationship before.

963
01:23:36,016 --> 01:23:39,602
Didn't believe any relationship
was forever.

964
01:23:42,188 --> 01:23:44,315
But a marriage is forever, right?

965
01:23:45,525 --> 01:23:47,777
I have often failed in love,

966
01:23:50,280 --> 01:23:52,115
I don't want to fail at marriage.

967
01:23:59,414 --> 01:24:01,082
I'll tell you a little secret.

968
01:24:02,292 --> 01:24:06,463
This forever kind of love is an idea
you girls are born with.

969
01:24:06,963 --> 01:24:09,966
And you'd just have to wait
for the right guy to show up.

970
01:24:10,717 --> 01:24:15,013
But till now you've only met lusty
fools like me. Can you think "forever?"

971
01:24:15,680 --> 01:24:20,018
Now the right guy has finally
shown up.

972
01:24:21,436 --> 01:24:22,896
Don't over-think.

973
01:24:23,605 --> 01:24:25,315
Anay is perfect for you.

974
01:24:26,691 --> 01:24:29,152
And he couldn't dream of
a better life-partner.

975
01:24:29,569 --> 01:24:31,780
It's Dharam's guarantee!
You're 24-hour entertainment.

976
01:24:32,030 --> 01:24:33,948
He'll never get bored.

977
01:24:34,908 --> 01:24:36,242
Just say yes.

978
01:24:38,203 --> 01:24:39,996
No chance you'll fail.

979
01:24:46,795 --> 01:24:47,879
I can't believe...

980
01:24:48,171 --> 01:24:50,882
I'm asking you for advice in making
my biggest decision.

981
01:24:55,053 --> 01:24:58,223
- I'll be finished.
- Not really. You'll just get fat.

982
01:24:58,640 --> 01:25:01,935
You'll walk in the park with
a milk bottle in one hand...

983
01:25:02,185 --> 01:25:04,521
a pram in the other. What a life!

984
01:25:07,899 --> 01:25:09,025
I'm kidding!

985
01:25:09,859 --> 01:25:11,319
You'll be just fine.

986
01:25:12,779 --> 01:25:14,781
Mr. Citibank will keep you happy.

987
01:25:15,281 --> 01:25:17,283
Open your account with him.

988
01:25:20,203 --> 01:25:22,414
Marriage! Intense.

989
01:25:23,498 --> 01:25:25,917
It's forever, like a tattoo.

990
01:25:31,881 --> 01:25:33,633
- Thank you.
- Thank you?

991
01:25:36,219 --> 01:25:38,888
I needed reassurance from someone
who knows me.

992
01:25:39,347 --> 01:25:40,682
You're welcome, Ma.

993
01:25:48,732 --> 01:25:50,608
If I die, I won't spare you.

994
01:25:51,109 --> 01:25:52,986
Don't. I'll be right here.

995
01:26:34,110 --> 01:26:36,571
It's final? We'll never say
I love you, right?

996
01:26:36,863 --> 01:26:38,073
- Right.
- Cool.

997
01:26:38,490 --> 01:26:41,034
How do you say: "Never say
I love you" in French?

998
01:26:43,661 --> 01:26:47,290
"Ne dis jamais je t'aime."
Ah! So sexy!

999
01:26:59,386 --> 01:27:03,223
Never say I love you,
never say je t'aime.

1000
01:27:07,268 --> 01:27:10,772
Never say you're in love.

1001
01:27:11,439 --> 01:27:13,942
Never say je t'aime.

1002
01:27:15,110 --> 01:27:18,196
Your heart will desert you...

1003
01:27:19,072 --> 01:27:21,616
go easy on yourself.

1004
01:27:23,034 --> 01:27:26,371
You won't sleep at nights...

1005
01:27:26,955 --> 01:27:29,207
go easy on yourself.

1006
01:27:31,126 --> 01:27:34,838
Never say I love you,
never say je t'aime.

1007
01:27:38,717 --> 01:27:42,053
Never say you're in love.

1008
01:27:43,013 --> 01:27:45,223
Never say je t'aime.

1009
01:28:02,907 --> 01:28:06,453
You'll end up weeping,
losing your friend too.

1010
01:28:06,911 --> 01:28:09,873
Don't. No, don't say those words.

1011
01:28:10,832 --> 01:28:14,127
Why sleep on a bed of thorns
for no reason?

1012
01:28:14,461 --> 01:28:17,797
Don't. No, don't say those words.

1013
01:28:18,173 --> 01:28:21,509
Your breath will freeze on your lips.

1014
01:28:22,093 --> 01:28:24,262
I promise you.

1015
01:28:26,097 --> 01:28:29,142
You'll be all tied up in knots...

1016
01:28:30,018 --> 01:28:32,395
go easy on yourself.

1017
01:28:34,356 --> 01:28:37,650
Never say I love you,
never say je t'aime.

1018
01:28:41,821 --> 01:28:45,325
Don't. No, don't say those words.

1019
01:29:06,388 --> 01:29:08,515
A girl calls you 24/7.

1020
01:29:10,392 --> 01:29:12,769
Shall I buy this phone? You advise.

1021
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:15,730
What to wear? You suggest.

1022
01:29:16,147 --> 01:29:17,982
Her car breaks down - you fix it.

1023
01:29:19,401 --> 01:29:20,443
Meaning...

1024
01:29:21,111 --> 01:29:23,488
her life cannot function
without you.

1025
01:29:25,156 --> 01:29:28,451
She's the heroine, you her hero.

1026
01:29:31,996 --> 01:29:33,456
Then one fine day...

1027
01:29:34,499 --> 01:29:37,210
another guy enters her life.

1028
01:29:38,795 --> 01:29:40,630
You realise that...

1029
01:29:41,047 --> 01:29:43,800
the real hero is another man.

1030
01:29:45,051 --> 01:29:47,012
You're the supporting act,
the side hero.

1031
01:29:51,558 --> 01:29:54,394
Uncle, looks like you've been there.

1032
01:29:54,894 --> 01:29:58,148
You've probably played many
supporting roles too.

1033
01:29:58,565 --> 01:30:02,527
Let's raise a toast to that.
Cheers to side heroes!

1034
01:30:02,986 --> 01:30:04,487
Cheers, my boy!

1035
01:31:14,724 --> 01:31:15,850
Anay and Shyra!

1036
01:31:19,604 --> 01:31:22,148
Wow! You've become
Shah Rukh Khan!

1037
01:31:23,608 --> 01:31:25,026
Where the hell have you been?

1038
01:31:25,360 --> 01:31:29,072
No call, no message. I was going nuts,
wedding shopping alone.

1039
01:31:29,447 --> 01:31:32,200
Sorry. I was in Courchevel with
Christine's family. Skiing.

1040
01:31:32,409 --> 01:31:33,618
No network.

1041
01:31:34,077 --> 01:31:35,912
- Christine has a family?
- A massive one!

1042
01:31:36,246 --> 01:31:38,998
Two brothers, two fathers.
All footballers.

1043
01:31:39,290 --> 01:31:40,500
By the way...

1044
01:31:41,084 --> 01:31:44,045
Very soon a new member
is joining her family.

1045
01:31:45,672 --> 01:31:46,672
What?

1046
01:31:46,923 --> 01:31:47,923
Yeah!

1047
01:31:48,633 --> 01:31:50,427
I'm marrying Christine.

1048
01:31:52,595 --> 01:31:53,638
You, what?

1049
01:31:53,930 --> 01:31:57,017
She doesn't know yet. I'll surprise her
when the moment's right.

1050
01:31:57,475 --> 01:31:58,935
Had to tell you first.

1051
01:32:04,357 --> 01:32:07,152
One doesn't just get married.
Think about it.

1052
01:32:07,485 --> 01:32:09,904
You have nothing in common.

1053
01:32:10,280 --> 01:32:12,866
You're not thinking from your head,
but from elsewhere!

1054
01:32:13,450 --> 01:32:14,450
Wow!

1055
01:32:15,452 --> 01:32:18,830
You decide from head and heart.
Me? From elsewhere!

1056
01:32:19,581 --> 01:32:23,376
Remember you asked for advice about
Anay. I was so happy for you!

1057
01:32:23,752 --> 01:32:27,130
- But you?
- Don't imagine I took your advice.

1058
01:32:27,505 --> 01:32:29,466
- It was my decision.
- And this is mine.

1059
01:32:29,841 --> 01:32:33,094
Stop it, Dharam. Big difference
between Anay and Christine.

1060
01:32:33,720 --> 01:32:38,016
Christine is probably a nice girl,
but she's not right for you.

1061
01:32:39,017 --> 01:32:41,061
You need someone to balance you.

1062
01:32:41,394 --> 01:32:44,397
Someone who can can
control your immaturity.

1063
01:32:44,898 --> 01:32:47,484
She is half-crazy too,
how will she handle you?

1064
01:32:48,985 --> 01:32:52,113
I know you very well. You're
not ready for marriage.

1065
01:32:52,447 --> 01:32:55,116
You're definitely not
marrying her. Got it?

1066
01:33:00,747 --> 01:33:01,956
I get it.

1067
01:33:04,167 --> 01:33:05,251
You get what?

1068
01:33:07,671 --> 01:33:08,755
Nothing.

1069
01:33:12,509 --> 01:33:14,928
- You laughing at me?
- No. I'm laughing at me.

1070
01:33:17,263 --> 01:33:18,932
It's crystal clear.

1071
01:33:20,975 --> 01:33:22,435
What's clear?

1072
01:33:26,481 --> 01:33:28,400
You're not over me.

1073
01:33:30,485 --> 01:33:31,986
You're still not over me.

1074
01:33:35,407 --> 01:33:38,952
That's why you can't bear
to see me with someone else.

1075
01:33:40,662 --> 01:33:43,206
You can't bear me settling down.

1076
01:33:43,456 --> 01:33:46,793
'Cos it reminds you of
your own shortcomings.

1077
01:33:48,878 --> 01:33:52,632
And what you lack that stops me
from marrying you.

1078
01:33:55,010 --> 01:33:56,219
I get it.

1079
01:34:08,523 --> 01:34:10,942
First you broke my heart
as a lover.

1080
01:34:13,528 --> 01:34:15,864
Now you're breaking it
as a friend.

1081
01:34:21,202 --> 01:34:22,287
It's good.

1082
01:34:23,997 --> 01:34:28,168
Finally it's over between us.
You can't hurt me anymore.

1083
01:34:32,464 --> 01:34:34,758
You know what. Do whatever.

1084
01:35:43,993 --> 01:35:44,993
What?

1085
01:35:46,329 --> 01:35:47,539
I'll be back in a minute.

1086
01:35:49,499 --> 01:35:50,959
Ladies and gentlemen,

1087
01:35:51,334 --> 01:35:54,963
Shyra's best friend Dharam has just
proposed to beautiful Christine.

1088
01:35:55,505 --> 01:35:58,133
Join me in raising a toast
to this wonderful surprise!

1089
01:36:01,636 --> 01:36:03,430
My man, fix the date now.

1090
01:36:03,680 --> 01:36:06,683
We're getting married
on the same day as you.

1091
01:36:07,017 --> 01:36:08,601
Same time, same place?
Done?

1092
01:36:08,935 --> 01:36:09,935
Done!

1093
01:36:10,478 --> 01:36:13,314
Everyone, you're no longer invited
to the Anay and Shyra wedding.

1094
01:36:15,108 --> 01:36:19,237
You're invited to a double wedding.
The Dharam and Christine...

1095
01:36:19,612 --> 01:36:24,367
Anay and Shyra wedding on 21 April
in exclusive Picardie.

1096
01:37:28,473 --> 01:37:31,351
Why did Christine bring bodyguards?

1097
01:37:31,726 --> 01:37:34,854
They're not bodyguards. They're her
footballer brothers and Dads...

1098
01:37:35,230 --> 01:37:36,981
her mother is behind them.

1099
01:37:38,525 --> 01:37:41,861
Christine's brother is such
a gentleman, so loving.

1100
01:37:42,487 --> 01:37:47,075
- Like an Indian son, not very French.
- That's Christine's stepfather.

1101
01:37:48,785 --> 01:37:50,161
Don't drink with them.

1102
01:37:50,412 --> 01:37:53,707
They love whacking their
drinking pals. End of you.

1103
01:37:57,043 --> 01:38:00,046
That group is Anay's banker friends.

1104
01:38:00,964 --> 01:38:03,049
Highly educated, very rich.

1105
01:38:03,466 --> 01:38:05,051
Keep away, out of your league.

1106
01:38:10,640 --> 01:38:12,017
They're Shyra's friends.

1107
01:38:12,684 --> 01:38:16,479
Hard figuring out who is straight
or who is gay.

1108
01:38:16,771 --> 01:38:18,898
So protect your family jewels.
Stay away.

1109
01:38:19,315 --> 01:38:21,776
So must I just say bonjour-merci
and run?

1110
01:38:22,152 --> 01:38:23,528
No silly jokes, please.

1111
01:38:23,778 --> 01:38:26,364
You're my only guest.
I have a reputation to protect.

1112
01:38:26,698 --> 01:38:29,325
- Must I wear a burqa?
- Yeah! You'll look slimmer.

1113
01:38:30,702 --> 01:38:31,703
Hi, guys!

1114
01:38:36,916 --> 01:38:39,085
Why the hell is Shyra marrying?

1115
01:38:40,003 --> 01:38:42,756
If I knew, I'd be
an expert on women.

1116
01:38:44,382 --> 01:38:45,675
Why are you getting married?

1117
01:38:48,094 --> 01:38:50,638
If I knew, I'd be
an expert on life.

1118
01:38:55,810 --> 01:38:59,522
Maybe she's marrying for
the same reason you are.

1119
01:39:01,274 --> 01:39:02,901
Hello, darling!

1120
01:39:04,319 --> 01:39:07,155
- So you're a Kamasutra expert?
- Learn from me.

1121
01:39:09,991 --> 01:39:15,288
Jogi, don't you feel like a guest
at a neighbour's wedding?

1122
01:39:15,830 --> 01:39:19,501
If we were in India, shehnais
would be playing.

1123
01:39:19,959 --> 01:39:24,506
There'd be a dessert counter there,
laden with goodies.

1124
01:39:25,131 --> 01:39:27,133
And the drums would be playing.

1125
01:39:27,801 --> 01:39:31,179
We raised her as a French girl.
Why cry now?

1126
01:39:31,763 --> 01:39:34,224
Sip your champagne.
Calm your nerves.

1127
01:39:34,974 --> 01:39:37,686
I feel like giving her a hard slap.

1128
01:39:37,977 --> 01:39:41,231
And bring her up all over again,
in full Indian style.

1129
01:39:41,690 --> 01:39:42,774
You're silly.

1130
01:39:43,274 --> 01:39:46,820
We don't bring up kids anymore.
They bring us up.

1131
01:39:47,696 --> 01:39:49,406
Bless me!

1132
01:39:49,781 --> 01:39:54,619
Mehra has ordered Indian snacks.
The waiter will serve you hot chai.

1133
01:39:55,036 --> 01:39:56,746
We'll make do with champagne.

1134
01:39:57,038 --> 01:39:59,958
No way, sir. My guests must
enjoy my style.

1135
01:40:01,584 --> 01:40:03,920
- Are you ok?
- Tip top! Doesn't it show?

1136
01:40:04,421 --> 01:40:06,715
Shows too much. That's what
worries me.

1137
01:40:08,383 --> 01:40:10,635
I can smell pakodas.
I'll be right back.

1138
01:40:13,555 --> 01:40:15,682
This rascal made Shyra's life hell.

1139
01:40:18,476 --> 01:40:23,148
Did Shyra behave any better?
Two nuts off the same tree.

1140
01:40:23,732 --> 01:40:26,359
Maybe that's why I could
never dislike him.

1141
01:40:32,866 --> 01:40:34,659
- I'm sorry.
- It's ok.

1142
01:40:38,788 --> 01:40:42,876
The real problem is Shyra can't
really dislike him either.

1143
01:40:43,960 --> 01:40:46,713
- It's piping hot.
- Thank you.

1144
01:40:50,133 --> 01:40:51,551
Shall I get you a napkin?

1145
01:40:51,801 --> 01:40:53,219
- Are you sure?
- It's fine.

1146
01:41:02,354 --> 01:41:04,606
Remember my crazy friend Chris?

1147
01:41:04,981 --> 01:41:06,941
- He wants to meet you.
- Really?

1148
01:41:19,579 --> 01:41:21,331
Good evening, everyone!

1149
01:41:21,956 --> 01:41:25,502
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome
to the Sangeet night.

1150
01:41:25,919 --> 01:41:29,923
In India, no wedding is complete
without this musical night.

1151
01:41:30,298 --> 01:41:33,677
Traditionally, it's a battle between
the boy's side and the girl's.

1152
01:41:34,094 --> 01:41:37,472
Tonight it's Dharam vs. Shyra.

1153
01:41:40,308 --> 01:41:41,308
All right!

1154
01:41:41,768 --> 01:41:45,563
We've seen their crazy anytime-
anywhere dancing.

1155
01:41:46,189 --> 01:41:49,901
Tonight they'll be dancing
together for one last time.

1156
01:41:50,485 --> 01:41:53,822
So put your hands together
for Dharam and Shyra.

1157
01:41:54,364 --> 01:41:55,364
No way!

1158
01:41:57,200 --> 01:41:58,576
No, I'm not dancing.

1159
01:41:59,536 --> 01:42:01,204
No seriously, Come on!

1160
01:42:06,459 --> 01:42:07,544
Yes!

1161
01:42:14,718 --> 01:42:17,637
Come on, guys! Make some noise
for Dharam and Shyra.

1162
01:47:09,429 --> 01:47:13,391
You still need Mummy's help
for some things in life.

1163
01:47:15,352 --> 01:47:17,937
How do you make a paratha
without a rolling pin?

1164
01:47:20,440 --> 01:47:21,649
That's cool.

1165
01:47:22,150 --> 01:47:26,363
How do you think your parents
became chefs in France?

1166
01:47:27,072 --> 01:47:28,114
That's true.

1167
01:47:29,407 --> 01:47:33,578
Why is my French child craving
an Indian paratha today?

1168
01:47:35,163 --> 01:47:39,459
You used to make parathas for me
to take to school till 3rd grade.

1169
01:47:40,377 --> 01:47:43,630
I remember. I also remember
you making...

1170
01:47:44,255 --> 01:47:47,092
peanut butter sandwiches instead.

1171
01:47:47,634 --> 01:47:50,679
You stopped eating Indian food
from that day.

1172
01:47:53,556 --> 01:47:58,144
When I opened my lunch box, all the
kids would run away from me.

1173
01:47:58,770 --> 01:48:02,399
They hated the smell of your
Punjabi ghee-parathas.

1174
01:48:03,274 --> 01:48:05,860
No one would play with me.
I was always alone.

1175
01:48:06,695 --> 01:48:10,615
But with sandwiches - that's when
I made friends.

1176
01:48:12,075 --> 01:48:14,494
From that day I became
completely French.

1177
01:48:15,203 --> 01:48:17,330
Disliked everything Indian.

1178
01:48:19,457 --> 01:48:21,376
The strange thing was...

1179
01:48:22,335 --> 01:48:24,170
whenever I got upset...

1180
01:48:24,713 --> 01:48:28,049
did badly at exams or fought with
a friend or...

1181
01:48:28,883 --> 01:48:30,677
broke-up with a boyfriend,

1182
01:48:31,344 --> 01:48:33,596
I quietly made myself a paratha...

1183
01:48:33,972 --> 01:48:36,057
and enjoyed eating it all alone.

1184
01:48:37,308 --> 01:48:40,061
Don't know why it changed
my mood.

1185
01:48:41,062 --> 01:48:43,273
It had the warm feel of Dad's hug,

1186
01:48:44,274 --> 01:48:46,276
the fragrance of your clothes.

1187
01:48:48,695 --> 01:48:51,531
It made me feel no matter what...

1188
01:48:53,324 --> 01:48:54,576
I was fine.

1189
01:48:55,493 --> 01:48:57,203
- I know.
- How?

1190
01:48:57,579 --> 01:49:00,582
Who cleared up the kitchen after
the mess you made?

1191
01:49:04,085 --> 01:49:07,213
What's the reason you want
a paratha today?

1192
01:49:09,257 --> 01:49:13,136
No reason. I just felt like having
a paratha.

1193
01:49:14,095 --> 01:49:15,095
Don't know why.

1194
01:49:17,557 --> 01:49:19,642
Today you're fighting yourself.

1195
01:49:20,935 --> 01:49:23,855
You're getting married
but you're unsure...

1196
01:49:24,105 --> 01:49:26,733
if this guy is as comforting
as a paratha.

1197
01:49:28,818 --> 01:49:32,197
It's not Papa's hug you seek,
or the fragrance of my clothes.

1198
01:49:33,698 --> 01:49:34,978
Today you're looking for love...

1199
01:49:37,118 --> 01:49:40,622
wrapped in laughter and fun,
in songs and dances.

1200
01:49:41,289 --> 01:49:46,294
Someone who makes up after
silly fights. A lifetime best friend.

1201
01:49:53,802 --> 01:49:58,473
Find what you're looking for.
If you don't find it, don't marry.

1202
01:50:00,600 --> 01:50:04,479
This is not India. Take advantage
of being French.

1203
01:50:49,441 --> 01:50:50,483
What is it?

1204
01:50:54,195 --> 01:50:55,447
I don't want to get married.

1205
01:51:03,121 --> 01:51:04,497
What an idiot!

1206
01:51:08,251 --> 01:51:10,795
You're the biggest fool
in the world. Know that?

1207
01:51:11,171 --> 01:51:12,171
I know.

1208
01:51:12,464 --> 01:51:15,675
You've always said that.
I totally agree now.

1209
01:51:22,932 --> 01:51:24,893
How did you get into
this marriage mess?

1210
01:51:25,352 --> 01:51:26,394
It's your fault.

1211
01:51:26,644 --> 01:51:28,355
- My fault?
- What else?

1212
01:51:28,813 --> 01:51:31,107
You suddenly decided to marry.

1213
01:51:31,483 --> 01:51:34,194
I didn't want to be left alone.
Damn it!

1214
01:51:34,569 --> 01:51:35,987
I'll get married too.

1215
01:51:36,571 --> 01:51:40,533
- You were marrying because I was?
- What else?

1216
01:51:41,159 --> 01:51:44,996
I was angry, upset, alone.

1217
01:51:45,663 --> 01:51:47,332
Why were you upset?

1218
01:51:48,500 --> 01:51:49,584
I don't know.

1219
01:51:50,669 --> 01:51:53,755
You know I don't know
why I do what I do.

1220
01:51:54,255 --> 01:51:56,841
Also, I had to play
your best friend.

1221
01:51:57,550 --> 01:52:01,846
You were happy. I was trying
to be mature and a good friend.

1222
01:52:02,389 --> 01:52:06,559
And what if you didn't need to behave
or to be mature?

1223
01:52:07,852 --> 01:52:09,521
What would you have done?

1224
01:52:11,731 --> 01:52:12,857
I don't know.

1225
01:52:14,526 --> 01:52:16,319
Anyway, what's the point now?

1226
01:52:20,782 --> 01:52:21,908
You're right.

1227
01:52:23,702 --> 01:52:26,287
- No point now.
- Tell me what can I do...

1228
01:52:26,705 --> 01:52:28,248
to get out of this mess?

1229
01:52:29,374 --> 01:52:30,750
Can I play dead?

1230
01:52:31,543 --> 01:52:33,962
Mehra could say I drowned.
Body missing.

1231
01:52:34,838 --> 01:52:36,381
Should I leave a note and run?

1232
01:52:37,424 --> 01:52:39,718
Or say I have a bad heart,
6 months to live.

1233
01:52:40,051 --> 01:52:41,302
Tell her straight.

1234
01:52:41,928 --> 01:52:43,304
What do you mean?

1235
01:52:44,723 --> 01:52:47,767
Look Christine in the eye,
and tell her the truth.

1236
01:52:49,019 --> 01:52:50,979
Truth and nothing but the truth.

1237
01:52:51,688 --> 01:52:53,398
That's the only way.

1238
01:52:55,525 --> 01:52:58,153
If you say I love you
or break a heart...

1239
01:52:58,945 --> 01:53:00,780
there are no shortcuts.

1240
01:53:03,533 --> 01:53:04,826
Go and tell her.

1241
01:53:05,326 --> 01:53:08,371
At first she may cry.
But she'll be ok soon.

1242
01:53:09,372 --> 01:53:10,874
The most important thing is...

1243
01:53:11,291 --> 01:53:14,461
you would've finally become
a gentleman from a Delhi lad.

1244
01:53:24,471 --> 01:53:25,513
I'm off.

1245
01:53:26,097 --> 01:53:28,975
Don't know about you, but I'm
marrying in the morning.

1246
01:53:33,021 --> 01:53:34,021
Shyra.

1247
01:53:48,578 --> 01:53:50,997
I would've been such an idiot
without you.

1248
01:53:51,706 --> 01:53:52,706
True!

1249
01:53:56,211 --> 01:53:57,504
Another truth?

1250
01:54:00,173 --> 01:54:03,218
When I see you with another man,
I'm sick to my stomach.

1251
01:54:11,434 --> 01:54:15,563
I hope your marriage breaks up
tomorrow.

1252
01:54:17,732 --> 01:54:19,609
If you have the guts, you break it.

1253
01:54:21,945 --> 01:54:23,196
I dare you!

1254
01:54:31,871 --> 01:54:32,871
No.

1255
01:54:36,376 --> 01:54:38,920
I can destroy only
one marriage in a day.

1256
01:55:04,571 --> 01:55:07,991
Don't ever look back...

1257
01:55:08,867 --> 01:55:11,661
at the street you have
left behind.

1258
01:55:12,579 --> 01:55:15,582
If you see him somewhere...

1259
01:55:16,750 --> 01:55:18,918
turn and walk away.

1260
01:55:20,503 --> 01:55:24,174
Never say I love you,
never say je t'aime.

1261
01:55:28,345 --> 01:55:31,598
Never say you're in love.

1262
01:55:32,474 --> 01:55:34,934
Never say je t'aime.

1263
01:55:36,227 --> 01:55:39,481
Thorns are strewn on this path...

1264
01:55:40,106 --> 01:55:42,567
careful where you tread.

1265
01:55:44,069 --> 01:55:47,489
Impossible desires will
swallow up your heart.

1266
01:55:48,073 --> 01:55:50,283
Go easy on yourself.

1267
01:56:29,864 --> 01:56:30,864
Come, come.

1268
01:56:34,786 --> 01:56:36,037
One minute.

1269
01:56:37,497 --> 01:56:38,497
Just wait.

1270
01:56:42,043 --> 01:56:43,378
Anay, my friend!

1271
01:56:44,087 --> 01:56:46,965
Let me tell you,
you're my worst enemy.

1272
01:56:47,674 --> 01:56:49,467
You're taking Shyra away from me.

1273
01:56:50,093 --> 01:56:52,345
I wanted to wish you bad luck.

1274
01:56:52,929 --> 01:56:55,306
Now you're marrying Shyra,
I don't need to.

1275
01:56:59,936 --> 01:57:01,146
I'm not joking.

1276
01:57:02,439 --> 01:57:05,608
This girl has destroyed so many guys.

1277
01:57:06,609 --> 01:57:07,902
Me, too.

1278
01:57:08,820 --> 01:57:10,572
She'll turn you into a lap dog.

1279
01:57:11,239 --> 01:57:14,117
Has she told you how many guys
she's messed around with?

1280
01:57:14,576 --> 01:57:15,576
Oh sorry.

1281
01:57:15,577 --> 01:57:18,246
She hasn't messed around with you.
Your love story is platonic.

1282
01:57:18,580 --> 01:57:20,790
She's done everything with me.

1283
01:57:21,166 --> 01:57:25,295
Now she's being a saint.
She's a cheat. Careful!

1284
01:57:25,587 --> 01:57:27,922
She'll make your life hell.

1285
01:57:29,007 --> 01:57:33,803
She deserves a supporting act
like me. I'm already doomed.

1286
01:57:34,137 --> 01:57:37,849
Careful. Don't blow your life
by marrying her. Run!

1287
01:57:40,393 --> 01:57:41,393
Shyra...

1288
01:57:42,729 --> 01:57:44,439
will you handle your friend...

1289
01:57:45,565 --> 01:57:46,608
or must I?

1290
01:57:58,036 --> 01:58:00,246
Behaving like a Delhi idiot again!

1291
01:58:02,207 --> 01:58:03,583
What did I tell you?

1292
01:58:04,084 --> 01:58:06,378
Look straight into her eyes
and tell her...

1293
01:58:07,128 --> 01:58:10,173
the truth, nothing but the truth.

1294
01:58:13,593 --> 01:58:17,180
I love you. There's no
greater truth in my life.

1295
01:58:18,473 --> 01:58:20,850
Can't live without you. I tried.

1296
01:58:21,643 --> 01:58:23,520
I could manage without
the old Shyra.

1297
01:58:23,812 --> 01:58:26,856
But I can't live without
this best friend Shyra.

1298
01:58:28,316 --> 01:58:29,734
I'm going to kiss you now.

1299
01:58:30,360 --> 01:58:32,779
Slap me. Stop me forever.

1300
01:58:33,446 --> 01:58:35,073
Or never ever stop me.

1301
01:59:18,324 --> 01:59:19,325
You're dead.

1302
01:59:28,293 --> 01:59:29,461
Let go of me!

1303
01:59:44,684 --> 01:59:46,269
Wait! What is this?

1304
02:00:36,736 --> 02:00:38,279
Hail Mother Goddess!

1305
02:01:22,365 --> 02:01:24,868
See how I saved you from
that silent terminator?

1306
02:01:25,285 --> 02:01:27,495
You were marrying a serial killer.

1307
02:01:28,038 --> 02:01:31,374
Never trusted him. No one can
be that sugary.

1308
02:01:32,042 --> 02:01:34,044
Go back to Delhi. They won't
spare you here.

1309
02:01:34,336 --> 02:01:36,963
I'm French now. Paris is my home.

1310
02:01:37,297 --> 02:01:39,424
You still haven't learned
a word of French.

1311
02:01:39,758 --> 02:01:42,010
You're with me. My French dictionary.

1312
02:01:42,344 --> 02:01:44,262
I tried living with you once.
Not interested.

1313
02:01:45,555 --> 02:01:46,806
Marry me.

1314
02:01:49,142 --> 02:01:52,395
The biggest dare of your life.
Do you have the guts?

1315
02:01:53,938 --> 02:01:55,607
Know what marriage means?

1316
02:01:56,107 --> 02:01:58,068
Your life is in another's hands
forever.

1317
02:01:58,735 --> 02:02:00,862
Very few get it right.
That's why it's a dare.

1318
02:02:01,196 --> 02:02:03,782
It's one dare that
no one does alone.

1319
02:02:04,616 --> 02:02:05,992
It's a dare for two.

1320
02:02:07,786 --> 02:02:08,786
I know.

1321
02:02:24,761 --> 02:02:28,056
Ok, Dharam Gulati.
I put my life in your hands.

1322
02:02:29,724 --> 02:02:33,061
If you have the guts,
then put your life in mine.

1323
02:03:08,054 --> 02:03:10,765
If I die, I won't spare you.

1324
02:03:24,112 --> 02:03:26,614
After three years of
French kissing Shyra...

1325
02:03:26,948 --> 02:03:28,908
I finally understood what love is.

1326
02:03:30,577 --> 02:03:32,537
Love is a bungee jump.

1327
02:03:33,955 --> 02:03:35,707
Jump if you dare.

1328
02:03:37,500 --> 02:03:40,295
No guarantee of a safe landing.

1329
02:03:42,088 --> 02:03:45,508
The one who thinks will be
left behind. The one who jumps...

1330
02:03:46,968 --> 02:03:47,968
will fly!

1331
02:03:49,804 --> 02:03:52,390
So till you're in the air,
be carefree...

1332
02:03:52,974 --> 02:03:54,392
and enjoy the flight.

1333
02:03:54,893 --> 02:03:57,228
Maybe you won't need to land
after all.

1334
02:07:34,404 --> 02:07:36,281
I told you the knife
would be useless.

1335
02:07:36,531 --> 02:07:39,492
I'm no carpenter. How can I be
carrying a hammer?

1336
02:07:40,952 --> 02:07:41,703
I'm going.

1337
02:07:41,911 --> 02:07:44,372
Whose idea was
this love lock anyway?

1338
02:07:45,498 --> 02:07:46,738
- It's still your fault.
- Mine?

1339
02:07:47,083 --> 02:07:49,294
Obviously, all my ideas are stupid.

1340
02:07:49,586 --> 02:07:51,921
Why did this breakup love lock
excite you?

1341
02:07:52,297 --> 02:07:53,548
You knew you weren't over me.

1342
02:07:53,882 --> 02:07:57,302
But you insisted we'd promise
not to love each other.

1343
02:07:57,469 --> 02:07:58,595
You're so stupid.

1344
02:07:58,970 --> 02:08:01,806
- Can't believe you're blaming me.
- Of course!

1345
02:08:02,182 --> 02:08:04,392
Some days you say: "Never say
I love you."

1346
02:08:04,726 --> 02:08:07,604
Then you say: "Look into my eyes
and say you love me."

1347
02:08:07,896 --> 02:08:10,315
You're nuts. You break the lock.

1348
02:08:10,607 --> 02:08:14,527
You know what. Forget it.
I'm done with you.

1349
02:08:14,903 --> 02:08:16,363
- Where to?
- Anay's.

1350
02:08:16,696 --> 02:08:20,575
- I'll beg him to marry me.
- The psycho is in the madhouse.

1351
02:08:20,950 --> 02:08:22,535
I'm not coming after you.

1352
02:08:22,911 --> 02:08:23,911
Ok.

1353
02:08:24,245 --> 02:08:25,538
Fine.
