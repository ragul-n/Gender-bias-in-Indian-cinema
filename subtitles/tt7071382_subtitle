1
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:25,080
How our very own
grow apart

2
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:28,930
is reflected in the photographs
clicked over time.

3
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:31,420
It is evident

4
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,010
in their eyes.

5
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:45,800
It is disappointing to see just
so many of you today.

6
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:52,290
Given the seriousness of the topic
we expected more of you to be present.

7
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:55,730
Our honourable speaker today,

8
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,020
Mr. Sudhir Deshpande,

9
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:02,440
is here to share his views with us.

10
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:07,160
I request him to take the podium.

11
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,050
Hello everyone.

12
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,880
Welcome.

13
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:17,560
Although the topic is complicated,

14
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:21,410
I am not going to deliver
a sermon or discourse.

15
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:24,950
We have a projector and laptop here.

16
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:28,570
But I'm not going to make
any fancy presentation.

17
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:33,140
We'll use these only if necessary.

18
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:36,790
I am here to share
an experience.

19
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:38,710
A true story...

20
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,110
...from my friend's life.

21
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,260
So...

22
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:44,810
Twenty years ago,
my friend

23
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,920
Avinash Pathak,

24
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,180
got an engineering Diploma and joined
a gear box manufacturing company

25
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,540
as a supervisor.

26
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:56,500
He worked hard, did well and
was eventually

27
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:58,590
became Production Manager.

28
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:04,500
He was quite contented
when one day...

29
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:05,780
Just a minute Dad,

30
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:08,380
What exactly is the issue here?

31
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:13,050
Our company is going to stop
manufacturing gear boxes.

32
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:15,850
Are they going to shut down
your production department?

33
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:17,240
Yes.

34
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,580
They are focussing only
on designing them now .

35
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:21,900
So did they fire you?

36
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:24,760
No. They want me to
switch to designing.

37
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:26,130
So what is the issue?

38
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:29,880
For that I’ll have to
learn a new software...

39
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,600
CATIA...
or something like that.

40
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,500
Dad it’s quite simple.

41
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:37,590
I am not up to learning anything
new at this stage of my life.

42
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:39,850
So what are you going to do?
- I think I’ll...

43
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,130
opt for voluntary retirement.
- Dad!

44
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,110
Are you serious?

45
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:48,590
You can’t just resign like that.
- Why not?

46
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:52,050
Sameer, Sanika ... their education...
their weddings...

47
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:56,630
He is soon going to get his
assistantship, isn’t he?

48
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,120
Dad it’s not that simple.

49
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:01,330
I have enough problems here.

50
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:04,050
You’ll have to send
me money for now.

51
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:06,900
Ok. It won’t be that bad.

52
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:09,300
We’ve cleared our loans.

53
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,750
And she has her job.

54
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,180
But not permanent.

55
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,900
Only recently,
schools have agreed

56
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,680
to appoint counsellors.

57
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,260
It’ll work out.

58
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:24,970
Honestly,
I am not good at my job.

59
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,470
What do you mean?

60
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:32,130
I just don’t understand the
problems of these kids.

61
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:34,870
I can't conenct
with them at all.

62
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,180
How am I supposed to counsel?

63
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,290
Dad, well...

64
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,930
if you are done...

65
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:43,240
No, listen to me.

66
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,310
If I go for voluntary retirement,

67
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:48,020
the company will give
me a good package.

68
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,790
We’ll invest it and that will
take care of everything.

69
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:53,110
Baba but what will you
do with your time?

70
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:56,660
I’ll set up a
consultancy of my own.

71
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,810
Don’t worry.

72
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,670
I won’t spend all
my time at home.

73
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:04,110
Instead, why don’t you
just learn the software?

74
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,350
I am not going to
learn anything new.

75
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:11,480
Sameer How much longer?

76
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,170
Who was that?

77
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,580
Is anyone there with you?

78
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:16,180
No... No one.

79
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:20,430
Dad I think you shouldn’t
resign in a hurry.

80
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,250
Yes.

81
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:24,060
Dad.

82
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:34,470
Friends, we are here to bid a
warm farewell to Avinash Pathak.

83
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:38,720
Honestly I am disappointed
that Avinash

84
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:41,340
has chosen to retire
despite my request.

85
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:45,980
Had Mr. Pujari told me
he’s so fond of me...

86
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:48,840
I would’ve given my decision
another thought.

87
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:53,930
I hope you’re ready
with a speech.

88
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:56,200
No, I’ll speak impromptu.

89
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,560
I’m not comfortable
giving a speech.

90
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,640
Sameer is a wonderful speaker.
- Yes.

91
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:05,810
He has been a debating
champion for four years.

92
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:10,030
Is it true, what we
heard about Sameer?

93
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,040
I prefer directly asking you...

94
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:16,630
don’t want fan these rumours.
- What is it?

95
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,620
I’ve heard he is in a 'live-in'
relationship in the US?

96
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,700
He hasn’t told us about it.

97
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:27,020
Even if he were,
it is quite acceptable over there.

98
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,250
What about you?

99
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:31,400
What can we do about
it from here?

100
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:32,630
I’ll be right back.

101
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:35,080
Me too.

102
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,570
Avinash,

103
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:44,040
your casual attitude
towards your children

104
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:45,690
is what I don't agree with.

105
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:49,650
If they don’t understand what is
best for them we must guide them.

106
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:51,260
Paurnima for instance

107
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:54,460
would insist on wearing
fashionable outfits.

108
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,120
But I put my foot down.

109
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:00,820
Told her that she can’t
wear revealing clothes.

110
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:03,140
You know how people ogle.

111
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:06,020
But ... does she agree...
- I didn’t give her an option.

112
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:08,050
I have already told her...

113
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:10,810
she can invite boys home,

114
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:13,070
but then no locking doors,
for whatever reason.

115
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:16,090
We often enter her room
without knocking

116
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:18,860
to check on them.
- Yes.

117
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,410
Give me your phone.
- Why?

118
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,480
I want to make a call.
- Where’s yours?

119
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,790
They have started
checking my bills.

120
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,610
"Who is this guy" ...
"Why did you speak to him for so long?"

121
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:39,380
I wish Avinash a bright future.

122
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:40,980
Thank you.

123
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:50,610
Friends,

124
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,660
To begin with..

125
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:55,850
thanks for this
wonderfull farewell.

126
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:00,050
I know all of you have
just one question in mind.

127
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:02,930
Why did I choose to retire?

128
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:06,270
Why couldn’t I learn
the new software?

129
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:10,060
I wondered where
would that take me?

130
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:14,790
Even if I did learn
this software,

131
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:17,180
there would be something
new within an year

132
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:19,180
I would have to learn that too.

133
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:21,520
It goes on and on.

134
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:23,660
There is a new TV
in the market...

135
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:28,190
scrap the existing one
and buy the new one.

136
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,950
Change your cell phone
every six months.

137
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,670
Buy a new computer
every couple of years.

138
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:35,150
Change your definition of
good and bad every five years.

139
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,490
I felt this must stop
at some point.

140
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:42,940
So I have decided
to reject change.

141
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:47,540
When I declared my decision

142
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:49,170
my daughter asked me,

143
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:52,610
“Dad what will you do then?”

144
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:55,730
I didn’t have an answer then,

145
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:58,100
But now I do.

146
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:01,200
I have lost out on many
things over the years.

147
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,560
I am fond of photography.

148
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:07,110
I used to enjoy attending
music concerts.

149
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,220
I want to see Europe.

150
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,700
Now I have ample
time for all this.

151
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,100
You’re up early?

152
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:22,420
I didn't sleep at all.
- Why?

153
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,130
When I did doze off finally,
the alarm rang.

154
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:28,740
Just cancel the damned thing.

155
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,680
I am going to laze in bed
till 10 every morning.

156
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:33,000
Here.

157
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,730
Learn these basic
functions at least.

158
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:37,190
Why?

159
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,970
You spoke well last evening.

160
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,100
I didn’t prepare the speech.

161
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:43,870
just went with the flow.

162
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:48,460
Were you serious about Europe
or was it just for the effect?

163
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,660
I mean it.
We should go.

164
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,750
We’ll have to be careful
about expenses.

165
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,280
Why spend on a trip?

166
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:00,280
It's Ok. Let's go.

167
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:05,160
After two wonderful weeks
in Europe

168
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:08,060
my friend returned home.

169
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:14,620
He had everything
planned for the future.

170
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,800
That is exactly when
something happened,

171
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:23,700
that was to change
his life forever.

172
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,550
What a wonderful trip!

173
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:29,510
I’m feeling so refreshed
and positive.

174
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:33,190
Why are you fiddling
with your phone?

175
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:35,340
It just won’t switch on.
Look...

176
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,700
The battery’s full...
but it’s not working.

177
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,630
So?

178
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:47,610
Avinash’s phone
is not reachable.

179
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,530
Then try calling Asavari.
- Yes.

180
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:53,900
Yes...

181
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,670
yes...

182
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,480
no ...

183
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:00,880
Ok... thank you.

184
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,230
Customer care says they haven’t
deactivated your phone.

185
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:06,200
They said try switching it
off and on.

186
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:08,420
I’ve tried doing that already.

187
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:10,050
I told them...

188
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,370
They have asked you to
visit the mobile gallery.

189
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,440
Oh... I don’t want to get into
this after such a nice trip.

190
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,560
Mohan is calling...

191
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:23,910
Hello.

192
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:26,120
Hello, are you back?

193
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,670
Yes, we’ve just landed.

194
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:31,020
I couldn’t reach Avinash
so I called you.

195
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:33,860
Yes, there’s some
problem with his phone.

196
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:35,220
Ok. Sorry,

197
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:37,620
I know I am bothering you.

198
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:40,870
but I need to pay up this
evening so I had to call you.

199
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,760
Tell him that the cheque
he gave me has bounced.

200
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,120
What cheque is he talking about?

201
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:49,510
It has bounced.

202
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,800
I had lent him some money.

203
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,310
I’ll talk to him.

204
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:57,740
I had signed in hurry,
may be it didn’t match.

205
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:59,380
I’ll write another cheque today.

206
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:02,150
No, there’s no issue
with the signature.

207
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:03,860
Insufficient funds...

208
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,590
That was the reason.

209
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:08,770
How is that possible?
It’s just five hundred thousand.

210
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,870
I have at least five million
in my account right now.

211
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,940
Don’t worry, the bank must have goofed up.
I wiil check.

212
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:18,030
Ok. ok.

213
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:21,460
What did he say?
- I don’t get it.

214
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:26,910
This is so frustrating
after such a lovely trip.

215
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:31,380
I hope our money is safe.

216
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:33,900
Don’t worry.

217
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,360
If our account is hacked,
it’s the bank’s responsibility.

218
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:39,280
Our money is absolutely safe.

219
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:42,310
Sorry sir I had to
keep you waiting.

220
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,600
I have just checked
all your details.

221
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,250
Sir, in the past fifteen days,

222
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,280
you have done online transactions
worth five million rupees.

223
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:56,640
So now there is only four hundred and fifty
thousand rupees balance in your account.

224
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,400
That is why the cheque for
five hundred thousand bounced.

225
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,300
What ?!!

226
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:04,810
We’ve not done any
online transactions.

227
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:06,420
But these records...

228
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,600
In fact we haven’t opted for
online banking facility

229
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,730
because he doesn't like all that.

230
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:14,010
Madam online banking has been
activated two years ago.

231
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:17,110
There have been some
transfers to USA after that.

232
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,600
Yes that was for Sameer.

233
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:21,840
He had activated the online account.

234
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,580
Sir I am sure this is a case
of online banking fraud.

235
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,440
Yes this is a fraud.

236
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:28,840
Sir you should immediately
report this to Cyber Crime.

237
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,560
You’re already pretty late.

238
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,840
Late?
How could we be late?

239
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:35,820
We rushed here the
moment we found out.

240
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:38,930
But these transactions have been
happening since last two weeks.

241
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,690
You should have
reported immediately.

242
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,600
But we’ve just found out.

243
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:43,940
We send you text messages.

244
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,670
How would I get messages?

245
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,460
I was in Europe for the
past fifteen days.

246
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:49,990
My phone wasn’t on.
It’s not working even now.

247
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:51,380
We also send e-mails.

248
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:53,210
I haven’t received any e-mails.

249
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,960
Sir you may not have
checked your e-mails.

250
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,310
I had asked my daughter
to keep checking my e-mails.

251
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,950
Yes. We did speak to her yesterday.

252
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,390
She would have told us
if there were any mails.

253
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:06,650
Just a minute.

254
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:07,880
Here.

255
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:09,610
Check for yourself.

256
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:12,480
I’m sure you’ll find our mails.

257
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:15,020
I’ll ask Sanika.
- Yeah.

258
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:23,430
Have you landed?

259
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,000
Yes.

260
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:26,920
When will you be home?

261
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:29,810
We’ll be late,
there’s been a problem.

262
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:32,010
What problem?

263
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,070
Has Baba got any
emails from the bank?

264
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,320
Regarding online transfers?

265
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:39,440
I don’t think so.

266
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:42,370
What do you mean you
don’t ‘think’ so?

267
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:44,740
Baba had asked you to
check his mails.

268
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,780
Yes.

269
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,970
And you couldn't do
such a simple task?

270
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:52,060
There are no mails.
Check for yourself.

271
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:53,830
Not a single mail from the bank.

272
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,430
You’ve clearly forgotten.

273
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:58,490
The mails are sent automatically.

274
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,190
I don’t care.

275
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:03,560
My money has been stolen from the bank.
I want it back.

276
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,330
This is the bank’s fault.

277
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:07,450
Sir, please try to understand.

278
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:11,540
Someone has hacked
your computer.

279
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:13,980
It cannot be hacked.

280
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:15,760
How can you be so sure?

281
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,980
I have lost five million!

282
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:20,270
Do you realise how
serious this is?

283
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:23,610
Let me be clear,
if I don’t get my money

284
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,120
I’ll sue the bank.

285
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,960
We’ll sue the bank,
rest assured.

286
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:31,420
However,
these documents suggest that

287
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:36,170
someone has stolen the username
and password of your account. - So?

288
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:39,720
It doesn’t seem like
the bank is at fault.

289
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:41,120
So?

290
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:44,880
So I don’t think
we could win the case.

291
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:47,400
What are we supposed to do now?

292
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:50,580
You should file a police
complaint first.

293
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:00,260
Sir.

294
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:02,620
Have a seat.

295
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,930
Tea ?

296
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,400
No thanks.

297
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:10,080
Go ahead.

298
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:13,190
We want to report an
online banking fraud.

299
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:15,460
Sure.

300
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:19,310
Someone has stolen five million
rupees from his account.

301
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:20,970
Whoa!

302
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:23,540
Five million is not
a small amount!

303
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,950
What is the world coming to.

304
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:27,700
Here.

305
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:32,690
Your name, address, the bank
details, account number,

306
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,600
your email id... write it down.

307
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,280
Pen...?
There... all yours.

308
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:39,170
Thank you.

309
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:41,690
What do you do?

310
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,710
I used to work for
Avanti gear box.

311
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:45,850
... recently retired.

312
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:49,620
Oh !
If only.....

313
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,750
Huh?

314
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:55,000
My son has a diploma in
mechanical engineering.

315
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:57,240
He had applied for a job
in your company.

316
00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:00,150
If we had met earlier you
could’ve put in a word .

317
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,620
I certainly would have.

318
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:06,810
Sir. I wanted to know...

319
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:11,750
If we catch the fellow who
transfered money from the account

320
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,090
we will getl it back, right?

321
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:14,550
Of course!

322
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:17,790
But for that we need
all the bank details.

323
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:19,720
Our experts will work on it.

324
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,630
It's a whole process.

325
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:24,800
Can we do something right away ?

326
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,600
It's not that easy.

327
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:28,810
There are so many
pending cases.

328
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,340
So many?
- That's the way it is.

329
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,610
This is where all internet
crime cases are handled.

330
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,140
Someone maligns somebody
on social media.

331
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:39,190
Banking fraud, credit card fraud.

332
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,330
... nude photos...

333
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:43,430
Someone offends
religious sentiments

334
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:46,250
Merchandise is not delivered
even after online payment.

335
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:47,420
All kinds of cases.

336
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:49,720
Of late ,
these cases have been on the rise .

337
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:50,800
But it’s good.

338
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:51,550
What?

339
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,900
I mean - it keeps me on my toes.

340
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:57,360
These hackers come up with
innovative ideas everyday.

341
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:58,880
It’s fun to crack these cases.

342
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:01,780
That is why I chose to be
in Cyber Crime Division.

343
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:03,100
Oh, that's great!

344
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,130
I'll get my money
back, won't I?

345
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:08,890
Well... we can only try...

346
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:10,640
and hope for the best.

347
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,150
Have you put down your mobile number?
- Yes.

348
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:15,490
But it’s not been working
ever since we landed.

349
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,850
Sir I have checked it.
Your sim card has been blocked.

350
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:22,010
Yes.

351
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:24,830
But when I called you
this morning, you told me..

352
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,830
my number hasn’t
been de-activated.

353
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:29,790
Yes. Your number is functioning,
but this sim card has been blocked.

354
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:33,480
I dont quite understand.

355
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:36,520
Sir you had registered a complaint
about losing your phone.

356
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:37,980
What?
- Yes.

357
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:41,560
That's why your sim card has been
blocked and a new one has been issued.

358
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,120
This is rubbish.

359
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:45,910
This is my phone.
I never lost it.

360
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:48,230
Neither did I register
any complaint.

361
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:51,940
A new sim card has been
issued to you two weeks ago.

362
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:54,620
But I wasn't even in India then!

363
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:57,890
Bur Sir... It shows on our system.

364
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:59,560
But thats not how it is.

365
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:02,400
Ok now tell me,

366
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,930
what should I do to
activate my phone?

367
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,670
Sir, fill this form.

368
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,930
I would also need a
couple of documents.

369
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:11,710
What documents?

370
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:13,890
Proof of residence and identity.

371
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:16,650
But I don’t want a new number.

372
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:19,480
It's your mistake. why do I have to submit

373
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:21,250
any documents to fix that?

374
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:24,740
Sorry sir ,
but we need the documents.

375
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,530
What are you doing Avi?

376
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,310
Where have you been all day?

377
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,490
I have been worried sick.

378
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:00,380
Why didn’t you call?

379
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,010
My mobile is still not working.

380
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,100
You could’ve called
from a public phone.

381
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:05,850
I couldnt think straight .

382
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:08,270
As it is I don’t know
your number by heart.

383
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:12,490
Will you please tell me what
happened at the police station?

384
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:15,350
When will we get our money back?

385
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,150
He said it is a long procedure.

386
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:21,590
He’ll notify us from time to time.

387
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:27,460
The cyber crime inspector
was a bit weird.

388
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:28,850
Weird?

389
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:33,250
I doubt whether he
even knows his job.

390
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:36,140
Please don’t be so negative.

391
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:38,430
We attract destiny
with our thoughts.

392
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,830
Everything will be fine.

393
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,120
We are going to get
all our money back.

394
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:47,500
Why is your phone
still not working?

395
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:51,960
They need some documents...
that's what I'm looking for.

396
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:56,530
I had kept my driving license in this
drawer before we left for vacation.

397
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:58,550
It's missing.

398
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:01,250
The electricity bill for this month
should have been here.

399
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,890
Yeah...
- Well, it isn't.

400
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,830
Sanika must have put it somewhere.
We should ask her.

401
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,340
Where is she?

402
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:09,710
She has gone out with Pournima.

403
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:13,120
Does she even realize
the situation?

404
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:48,500
Look...

405
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:50,670
Don’t be so stressed.

406
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:55,490
I have heard that the test
can be misleading at times.

407
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:00,840
Can it go wrong five times?

408
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,090
Hello?
- Hello.

409
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:15,170
Hello Mr. Pawar?- Yes.

410
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:17,540
Avinash Pathak here.

411
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,700
I had registered a
complaint yesterday...

412
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:23,260
About five million
being stolen...

413
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,400
Remember?

414
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:26,230
Yes I had saved your number...

415
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:28,220
I knew it was you. That's
why I took the call.

416
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:32,540
I called to tell you my
phone has been activated.

417
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,310
Sure?

418
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:38,040
I’m sure you’ve called to know
the progress on your case.

419
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,000
No, I am aware of
your workload.

420
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,600
Well yes , but......

421
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:47,710
It's after all a matter
of five million...

422
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,060
Call anytime you like.
No issues...

423
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,430
Thank you.
Thank you sir.

424
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:54,780
I wanted to inform you that

425
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,500
somebody had made a false
complaint at the mobile gallery

426
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,970
and got a duplicate sim
card of my number.

427
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:03,480
Thought as much...

428
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:05,760
How else could they get
the OTP?

429
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,400
OTP ?

430
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:11,390
Come on now,
you don't know what OTP means?

431
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:15,250
I've never carried out such
transactions, how would I know ?

432
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:18,210
"OTP" stands for
One Time Password.

433
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:21,570
When you transfer money online,

434
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:24,790
the bank sends the
OTP on your mobile.

435
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:28,660
Unless you enter the OTP,
money can’t be transferred. - Is it?

436
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:32,060
So he got this duplicate sim card
for the OTP?

437
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:33,880
Correct.

438
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:37,170
You see, I got all your
bank details today.

439
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:39,820
Your money has been
transferred to ten accounts.

440
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,450
All waiters at a
local restaurant.

441
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:43,140
Waiters?

442
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:44,660
Funny, isn’t it?

443
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:48,710
You mean some waiters managed to
pull off such a high tech fraud?

444
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:53,370
I had never come across a
case like this. Strange!

445
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:55,620
But where did they get
all the knowledge?

446
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,450
Baffles me...

447
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:01,070
Your case is getting
very interesting.

448
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:03,650
This is way different
than the usual.

449
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,740
So once we nab these waiters...

450
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:09,600
That’s what I'm doing. We've just
caught some of them as we speak.

451
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:11,600
Here. Get him here.

452
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,780
He is their leader.

453
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:18,290
I'll speak to you later.
I’ll let you know

454
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,590
Ok.

455
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:24,370
Sir, license... papers?

456
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,080
What's the matter?

457
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,910
You were on the phone
while driving.

458
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:30,760
So what?
I was speaking to the police.

459
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:37,050
Alright, what's the fine ?

460
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,380
Have some tea.

461
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:46,220
No sir.
- Sure?

462
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,960
Ok..
later if you wish...

463
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:51,790
Hello...hello...

464
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,320
Ok.

465
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:56,360
What is your name?
- Unni.

466
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,880
Unni... What does that mean?

467
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:01,170
Sir, it is a name of God.

468
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,680
Good...

469
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,770
Where is the money?

470
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:07,950
I don’t know sir.

471
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:11,540
But the others are saying
you asked them to do this.

472
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:13,770
I didn’t steal any money sir.

473
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:16,600
I don’t understand
what you’re saying...

474
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:17,910
I’ll explain.

475
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:21,170
A lot of money
from one account..

476
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:24,370
has been transferred
to all your accounts.

477
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:25,970
Get it?

478
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:28,500
I don’t know
anything about that.

479
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:32,780
Sir these are not our accounts.
These are Badri Seth’s.

480
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:34,390
Who is Badri?

481
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:36,860
He comes to the restaurant.

482
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:40,420
What does he do?
- He is a businessman.

483
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:44,860
One day Badri said he wanted to
open a bank account. Urgently.

484
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,930
But he didn’t have
residence proof.

485
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:51,230
Why?
- He lives at a friend's place.

486
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:53,380
So he didn’t have any documents.

487
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:57,160
Badri Seth asked
me to help him.

488
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,760
" How?" I wondered.

489
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:03,930
He asked me to use my documents,
as proof of residence...

490
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:06,130
...and open an account in my name.

491
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:07,910
You have a rented
place in your name?

492
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:09,620
Yes Sir.

493
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:11,540
Go on.

494
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:15,670
So he asked me to open
a bank account.

495
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:20,110
But Badri Sheth
would operate it.

496
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:23,730
In return he offered me five
thousand rupees a month.

497
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:25,600
So you went ahead with it?

498
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:28,720
And made everyone
else do the same?

499
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,610
You didn’t think
it looked fishy?

500
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:37,290
Sir five thousand rupees a month
is a lot for a poor man.

501
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,830
Just a minute.

502
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,720
Tell me exactly what
Inspector Pawar say to you?

503
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:50,370
Does he mean the waiters
have not stolen our money?

504
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,550
Apparently.
- What now?

505
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,820
I really dont know.

506
00:28:57,510 --> 00:29:00,020
If we had been robbed

507
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:03,130
it would still have been ok.

508
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:06,250
At least, I would know
what was going on.

509
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:09,630
Here I've lost everything
and am totally clueless.

510
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:11,980
It will be ok.

511
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,760
How much do you have
in your account?

512
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,810
A little over a
hundred thousand.

513
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:20,650
If we don’t get the money back,

514
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:23,240
we’ll have to sell the house.

515
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:25,060
And where do we go?!!

516
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,880
We’ll move to some dingy hole!

517
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:30,460
Your negative thinking
invites bad luck!

518
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,200
Just say we'll get
the money back.

519
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:36,160
Enough of your
half baked theories!

520
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:39,750
Just saying "everything will be
fine" doesn't make things fine!

521
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:41,440
Baba.
- What is it?

522
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,140
There’s been a big problem.

523
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:44,990
Why don’t you say “It will be fine”?

524
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:46,700
Your problem will
simply vanish!

525
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,130
If you don’t believe it,forget it!

526
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:49,640
But don’t ridicule me.

527
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:51,840
This is a big problem.
I mean it.

528
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:56,110
What is it?
- I thought he was a nice guy.

529
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:59,370
Who?
- I've no clue how this happened.

530
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:01,980
I had invited him home
for just a cup of coffee.

531
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:04,110
Sanika what are you trying to say?

532
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:06,760
We haven’t spoken
to each other in days,

533
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:08,610
we haven’t been in touch.

534
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:12,250
Pournima just called me. Our...

535
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:15,010
Our video...
- Video?

536
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,770
What video?

537
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,130
Sanika!

538
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:34,570
What is it?

539
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:38,070
That...

540
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:41,950
to delete that video
from the internet,

541
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:44,580
I guess we'd have to see
Mr. Pawar again?

542
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,070
What video?
- The one...

543
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:49,570
There’s some video
with Sanika in it.

544
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:53,830
Is there objectionable
content in it?

545
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,600
Yes.
No, I mean...

546
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:58,730
We haven’t seen it yet but
there must be.

547
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,760
Sanika is terribly upset.

548
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:07,170
She had invited one Gautam
home when we were away.

549
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:11,610
He shot some video without
her knowledge and now...

550
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,190
it’s all over the internet.

551
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:15,300
Oh God.

552
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:17,910
You mean they...

553
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:20,410
both of them...

554
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:21,820
So...

555
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:28,040
You see Mr. Pawar right away.
Request him to...

556
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,070
do something and..

557
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:33,690
delete that video
from the internet.

558
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,810
I’ll be grateful.

559
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,930
Don’t you worry.

560
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:40,370
He’s very cooperative.
He’ll surely do something.

561
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:42,780
We’ll meet him in the morning.
- No.

562
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:45,590
I won't come.

563
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:47,190
You must go.

564
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:48,990
How can I ...

565
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:51,550
I cannot face him.

566
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:53,870
Tomorrow will be too late.

567
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:56,310
It will be all over
the internet tonight.

568
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:00,340
Please call him right now.

569
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,740
It’s past eleven...

570
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:06,550
Ok.

571
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:11,060
But before speaking to Mr. Pawar
why don’t you talk to Sanika?

572
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,040
What's the point talking to her?

573
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,970
Has she left
anything to be said?

574
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,470
Finally it's all my fault!

575
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:22,080
It’s not your fault.
- Yes it is.

576
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,940
We believe we have raised
our children well.

577
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,850
...that they know the
right from wrong...

578
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:28,960
...that they will be righteous.

579
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,920
You need to calm down.

580
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:34,960
This is a conspiracy.
- How is that possible?

581
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:39,000
Why else would this
happen to me twice?

582
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:41,200
Just a minute.
Hello Mr. Pawar.

583
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:43,000
Yes I’ll be home for lunch.

584
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:46,100
Don’t heat the food. I’ll
be there in sometime.

585
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,230
Come.
Have a seat.

586
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,920
Would you like some tea?
- No, thanks.

587
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:58,800
I have sent a mail to
remove that video.

588
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:01,640
But it will take at least
forty eight hours.

589
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:02,600
Why?

590
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,330
The server of that site
is not in our country.

591
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:07,350
So it will take time.

592
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:11,620
Don’t worry the video is
not too scandalous.

593
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:12,810
Is it?

594
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:16,450
None of us has seen
the video yet.

595
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,480
I have downloaded it.
Take a look.

596
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:22,670
Please not now.

597
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,170
I don’t want to watch it.

598
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:26,600
There is nothing offensive in it.
You can watch it.

599
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:30,910
Then why is my daughter so
upset since last night?

600
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:32,220
That...

601
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,500
You’ll know at the
end of the video.

602
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,130
Watch.

603
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:54,940
Are these ok?

604
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:56,990
You bet...

605
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:58,710
It's nice.

606
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,910
Why have you kept the
mobile like that?

607
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:09,830
Mobile? Where?

608
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,230
Near the television.

609
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,030
That ?... Charging.

610
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:15,830
I am charging my phone.

611
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,140
Thank you.

612
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:26,450
You have a lovely house.

613
00:34:36,970 --> 00:34:39,030
This is my new friend Sanika.

614
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:09,190
We can surely do something to
stop the rest of the videos?

615
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,930
No.
Why?

616
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:14,960
Even if we block one site,
he’ll come up with ten more.

617
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,850
Also, his transactions are in Bitcoins.

618
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:22,560
We have no clue who is paying
or receiving the money.

619
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:24,660
Bitcoins?

620
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,860
This is a new online currency.

621
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:30,200
All fraudulent transactions take
place through this currency.

622
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:34,750
But before the next part comes up
we must stop it.

623
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,320
You are right.

624
00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:39,340
But first

625
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:40,520
we need to...

626
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:42,950
find that kid.

627
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:44,640
How?

628
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:47,280
Sanika knows nothing about him.

629
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:50,820
He gave her a fake address.

630
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:53,160
I went there this morning.

631
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,440
Somebody reported that
your mobile was stolen,

632
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,830
and got a duplicate sim card.

633
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,110
Yes.

634
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:01,750
To get that from the mobile gallery,

635
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:04,900
he submitted this authority
letter signed by you.

636
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:07,750
This is forged.

637
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,230
Didn’t they figure it out?

638
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,730
Their signature
verification system

639
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:14,210
is not foolproof like a bank’s.

640
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:17,890
He submitted two
other documents.

641
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:20,740
Your original electricity bill

642
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,850
and a copy of your
driving license.

643
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:25,910
How did he get hold of these?

644
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:29,250
I had kept both these at home.

645
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:33,850
It means he needed to get
inside your home to get them.

646
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:37,400
According to you,
while you were away,

647
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:40,330
only one stranger had
entered your home.

648
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:42,600
The guy who uploaded the video.

649
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,790
Your daughter’s new
friend, Gautam.

650
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:46,260
But...

651
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,130
You mean

652
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:50,770
I mean both these crimes have been
committed by the same person.

653
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,890
Once we catch him,

654
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:56,390
we can stop the videos
and get your money back.

655
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:59,530
But for that, sir...

656
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:02,750
I must speak to your
daughter in detail.

657
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,110
Sanika.

658
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:14,300
You will not lock
your door anymore.

659
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:16,580
Why did you take so
long to open the door?

660
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:17,710
What's going on?

661
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:28,940
You are still chatting
in spite of all this?

662
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:31,300
I wasn’t chatting.

663
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:33,640
I was checking if he was online.

664
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:35,360
Why would he be online now?

665
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,350
He has got what he wanted.

666
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:39,220
Get ready.

667
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,050
Why?

668
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:44,030
Where are we going?

669
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:49,630
Is this what your friend
Gautam looks like?

670
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,100
Almost...except...

671
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,640
except for the eyes.

672
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:58,290
This has been created
by our artist.

673
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:01,540
based on the waiter’s description,
There could be some difference.

674
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,250
A photo might have helped.

675
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,530
I have one on my laptop.

676
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,360
Mail it to me immediately.

677
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:13,410
We had clicked some snaps
when we were together,

678
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:15,980
but I can't find it anymore.
- Let me see.

679
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:24,380
Don't you lock your phone?
- No.

680
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:26,960
You should. It's a good habit.

681
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:31,370
He must have deleted it
after he drugged you.

682
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:32,990
Drugged?

683
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:35,570
Yes, your father told me about it.

684
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:38,390
He spiked your soft drink
with a sedative.

685
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:42,640
So we know for sure that,

686
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:46,270
it's the same boy
who stole money and

687
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:48,100
uploaded the video as well.

688
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:51,960
Can't you do something
fast to delete that video?

689
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:55,610
Madam, we need to find
her friend for that.

690
00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:57,490
He is not her friend.

691
00:38:58,050 --> 00:39:00,010
She used to chat with him.

692
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:03,710
But that's when she must have
shared information,

693
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:08,200
with which he figured out
his username and password.

694
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:12,010
and then managed to steal driving
license and electricity bill.

695
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:17,570
But I had never spoken
about Dad's bank account.

696
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:21,040
We often do not realise that
while chatting casually,

697
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:24,320
we end up giving away
important information.

698
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:28,780
Is she feeling unwell ?

699
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,450
Have some water.

700
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:35,550
Thank you.

701
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:42,060
I have called for the chat history and
email conversations of the three of you.

702
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:45,910
I'll go through it and then
we can take further decision.

703
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:49,380
But wouldn't he have deleted
all the evidence by now?

704
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:54,630
Whatever we do on the internet can
never be completely destroyed.

705
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:56,260
It can be recovered.

706
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:59,230
We can find the IP
address from where...

707
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:02,650
...the video has been
uploaded, can't we?

708
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:05,000
I mean by tracing the computer...

709
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:08,390
That method is outdated.
It was possible back then.

710
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:10,740
Now sites have been developed,

711
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:13,260
that can conceal the
identity of the user.

712
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,970
In this case that boy has used
the same modus operandi.

713
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:20,610
That is what makes it
difficult to catch him.

714
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:25,090
Ok.
Leave it to me now.

715
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:27,640
Thank you.

716
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,990
If you remember anything....
just anything....

717
00:40:36,410 --> 00:40:37,580
do let me know.

718
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:44,910
He did not drug me.

719
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:49,860
I was well aware of
what was happening.

720
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:55,220
I'm sure you think I am an
extremely stupid girl, but...

721
00:40:56,140 --> 00:41:00,250
you need to know the truth
to be able to catch him.

722
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,310
That's why I told you.

723
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:26,340
Did you have to be so honest?
- What do you mean?

724
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,540
You shouldn't have insulted your
dad in front of the inspector.

725
00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:31,860
How did I insult him?

726
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:35,400
If your father had already told him
that the boy had drugged you,

727
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:37,740
Why should we lie?

728
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,510
Is it something to proudly
shout from the rooftop?

729
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:45,540
I know I have never
done you proud.

730
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:47,900
Enough of your nonsense!

731
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:51,980
All this happened because you
gave away Dad's bank details!

732
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:56,890
Forget the money....

733
00:41:58,170 --> 00:42:00,720
....what if we can't stop the video?

734
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:06,570
A matter of two weeks...

735
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:08,170
and look where you have got us.

736
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,220
I had not planned on this!

737
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:13,520
Am I not suffering too?

738
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:16,410
How could you bring a stranger
home in the first place?

739
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:18,380
He was not a stranger anymore.

740
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,910
Is chatting a good enough
way to know someone?

741
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:24,030
You only met him once,
at the mall, didn't you?

742
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:25,360
Yes.
- So?

743
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:29,000
He seemed very nice
when we chatted.

744
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:32,170
He was decent even when
we met in person.

745
00:42:33,770 --> 00:42:36,550
I misjudged him.

746
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:39,740
But couldn't that
happen to anybody?

747
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:42,050
One may judge a person wrongly,

748
00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:44,950
But what made you
go so far with him?

749
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:47,540
So far?

750
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:51,960
Have I committed a crime by
having sex before marriage?

751
00:42:52,330 --> 00:42:53,950
Don't you think this is wrong?

752
00:42:54,210 --> 00:42:56,530
What if he had cheated
me after marriage?

753
00:42:56,590 --> 00:42:59,280
He wouldn't have made obscene
internet videos of you.

754
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:03,400
Many people have secretly shot
their wedding night videos

755
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:05,380
and uploaded them on the internet.
Want to see?

756
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:09,270
Stop making senseless arguments!

757
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,760
You were wrong.That's it!

758
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:13,520
And what about Sameer?

759
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:14,640
What about him?

760
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:18,070
You don't mind that he is
living in with his girlfriend.

761
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:20,220
They are just room-mates.

762
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,720
And what do you think
they do at night?

763
00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:27,160
Can't seem to get their hands off
each other even in photographs.

764
00:43:27,370 --> 00:43:30,240
I'm sure you've seen his status:
'In a relationship'

765
00:43:30,350 --> 00:43:32,680
That is not relevant here.
- How so?

766
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:35,530
He gets away with everything...

767
00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:37,060
Will you just shut up?

768
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:38,780
Don't raise your voice with me.

769
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:41,030
Whatever they may be up to...

770
00:43:41,090 --> 00:43:43,250
....it hasn't cost
us five million.

771
00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:47,270
Who keeps five million in
a Saving's Account!

772
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:50,590
We were going to invest it
after returning from vacation.

773
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:53,290
What does the police say?

774
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:56,270
Of course, our police
department is useless.

775
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,620
No. In fact they are
helping us a lot.

776
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:01,220
But how could you be so stupid?

777
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:02,810
Sameer,

778
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:05,420
tell me if you have
a way out of this.

779
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:07,560
Don't sit there
pointing fingers at us.

780
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:10,350
Baba why don't you
understand that -

781
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:11,720
What are you doing?

782
00:44:12,270 --> 00:44:13,340
Sanika!

783
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:15,700
Sanika!
- Why are you calling her?

784
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:19,420
Let's get packing.
- Why?

785
00:44:19,850 --> 00:44:22,780
If we are unable to stop the video,
we are done.

786
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:25,570
Where will we go?
- Just anywhere!

787
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:28,500
Everything I had ever
earned in my life is gone.

788
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:31,610
I can't look anybody in the eye.

789
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:35,500
Avi where are you going?

790
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:22,000
Roll down the window.

791
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:23,320
Roll it down I said!

792
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,020
What is it sir?
Why were you honking?

793
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:27,500
Why did you honk?

794
00:45:28,030 --> 00:45:29,740
Why did you honk? Why?

795
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:31,560
Are you in such a rush?

796
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:34,110
What is that?
A signal.

797
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:35,790
What colour is it?
- Red.

798
00:45:35,850 --> 00:45:37,640
What does red stand for?
Stop.

799
00:45:37,890 --> 00:45:40,630
Got it? What does red stand for?
Stop.

800
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,230
That's why I had stopped.

801
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:45,290
Why did you honk?

802
00:45:50,010 --> 00:45:52,420
Wait.
Where you going? Wait!

803
00:45:55,930 --> 00:45:57,250
What is the hurry?

804
00:45:57,630 --> 00:45:59,050
Smartass!

805
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:30,560
Move your car, the
signal has turned green.

806
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:32,740
I won't.
I am going to stay put.

807
00:46:33,010 --> 00:46:35,740
Do what you want.
-Stay here you fool.

808
00:46:43,690 --> 00:46:45,190
Hello? What is it?

809
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:49,400
Which hospital?

810
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:57,900
Asavari, what's the matter?

811
00:46:58,180 --> 00:47:00,910
Why is your phone not reachable?
-No network here.

812
00:47:00,970 --> 00:47:02,390
What has happened?

813
00:47:43,710 --> 00:47:45,040
What is wrong with her?

814
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:47,430
Why aren't you saying anything?

815
00:47:49,310 --> 00:47:50,630
Was it an accident?

816
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:52,580
Fell off her scooter or something?

817
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:57,300
No it was not an accident.

818
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:02,090
Although that's what we
have been telling people.

819
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:05,150
Then...

820
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:09,900
Told us she was going on a trip
for a couple of days.

821
00:48:11,650 --> 00:48:14,070
Went to some lowly hospital
and got an abortion done.

822
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:20,350
She was going to stay at the
boy's place for two days.

823
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:25,210
But she began bleeding
profusely on her way.

824
00:48:27,450 --> 00:48:30,020
He got shit scared
and dumped her...

825
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:35,790
But then...

826
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:39,360
What do the doctors have to say?
- What will they say?

827
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:42,560
There are complications.

828
00:48:44,810 --> 00:48:46,400
They don't seem too hopeful.

829
00:48:52,650 --> 00:48:54,470
She never confided in us.

830
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:59,640
We might have been furious,
but would have ultimately stood by her.

831
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:06,040
She trusted that boy more than us.

832
00:49:09,310 --> 00:49:10,770
What an irony.

833
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,290
I know the best doctors
and hospitals, but...

834
00:49:17,810 --> 00:49:19,810
None of it matters anymore.

835
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:23,580
It's...

836
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:51,840
What is all this Asavari?
- Nothing.

837
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:53,930
What do you mean, nothing?

838
00:49:54,470 --> 00:49:56,270
What are you doing
with all these photos?

839
00:49:56,490 --> 00:49:58,510
Leave me alone.
Don't irritate me.

840
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:01,470
Asavari what are you doing?

841
00:50:02,830 --> 00:50:04,690
Do you have to do
this right now?

842
00:50:06,130 --> 00:50:07,680
Do you have to
drink right now?

843
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:09,100
You sugar level will rise.

844
00:50:09,190 --> 00:50:11,000
Don't preach!

845
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:14,080
Doctors said vodka is fine.

846
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:17,020
How could it be fine?
Do you think I'm stupid ?

847
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:19,830
I know what I am doing.
- Do you?

848
00:50:20,290 --> 00:50:23,100
If you're so smart, why don't you
do something to delete that video?

849
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:35,740
Calm down Asavari.

850
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:37,700
Please calm down.

851
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:44,450
Look.

852
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:46,920
No point fighting with each other.

853
00:50:49,590 --> 00:50:51,600
Why is this happening to us?

854
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:54,770
Why don't you do something?
Please...

855
00:50:56,830 --> 00:50:58,390
We don't need this.

856
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:00,980
That is all I can think of and

857
00:51:01,370 --> 00:51:03,030
I don't have any answers.

858
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:08,530
And neither of the kids is
with us at this critical time.

859
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:15,110
Sameer speaks to us like
an aloof acquaintance.

860
00:51:16,630 --> 00:51:18,860
And I can't fathom what's
going on with this girl.

861
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:21,130
What's got into her?

862
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:26,190
That's what I was looking
for in these photos.

863
00:51:26,870 --> 00:51:27,910
What?

864
00:51:28,150 --> 00:51:30,000
I had read somewhere.

865
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:33,360
How our very own grow apart

866
00:51:33,850 --> 00:51:36,730
is reflected in the photographs
clicked over time.

867
00:51:37,950 --> 00:51:41,080
It is evident in their eyes.

868
00:51:41,910 --> 00:51:43,670
Why this girl is
behaving like this,

869
00:51:44,370 --> 00:51:46,640
must be hidden somewhere
in these photos

870
00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:50,060
How did we not realise
it back then?

871
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:54,810
Asavari get a grip on yourself.

872
00:51:57,340 --> 00:52:00,030
Leave these photos here. Get up.

873
00:52:01,090 --> 00:52:02,110
Come.

874
00:52:04,510 --> 00:52:05,570
Sit.

875
00:52:07,590 --> 00:52:08,230
Asavari.

876
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:10,940
Where did we go wrong
with the kids?

877
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:13,730
Did we give them
too much freedom?

878
00:52:15,230 --> 00:52:17,810
Should we have bound them
like Pradnya and Mohan?

879
00:52:19,110 --> 00:52:21,020
But didn't that turn
out even worse?

880
00:52:21,790 --> 00:52:22,810
Yes.

881
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:25,790
I am very disturbed ever since
I saw Pournima.

882
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:29,460
Mohan said to me,

883
00:52:31,010 --> 00:52:33,420
“She trusted the boy more than us.”

884
00:52:35,130 --> 00:52:36,590
"Regardless of everything else,

885
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:39,270
ultimately we would have
stood by her.”

886
00:52:40,930 --> 00:52:43,680
But obviously Pournima
didn't believe so.

887
00:52:44,630 --> 00:52:46,070
But our daughter does.

888
00:52:46,870 --> 00:52:48,710
That's why she came
to us for help.

889
00:52:49,710 --> 00:52:52,840
Didn't try anything heroic.

890
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:54,430
You're right.

891
00:52:54,740 --> 00:52:56,810
Because she had faith in us.

892
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:00,040
She knew we would help
her, no matter what.

893
00:53:01,910 --> 00:53:04,560
But if we keep reacting like this...
- Like what ?

894
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:07,130
We are not being cruel to her.

895
00:53:07,830 --> 00:53:09,580
Most parents would have -

896
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,520
We are not like most parents...

897
00:53:13,570 --> 00:53:15,670
isn't that what we have
been telling ourselves?

898
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:19,490
Now it's time to prove it.

899
00:53:23,050 --> 00:53:25,650
This afternoon in a fit of rage
I said, “It’s all over.”

900
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:30,210
I think we make these
statements very casually.

901
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:33,990
It's over only when one dies.

902
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:37,260
That's when nothing can be done.

903
00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:40,360
But until then, we must try.

904
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:46,770
If we are so disturbed...
so shaken...

905
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:48,830
what must she be going through?

906
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,820
She is alone in her
room right now.

907
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:54,600
She needs us.

908
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:57,880
Let's go.

909
00:55:01,750 --> 00:55:03,900
This is how my friend

910
00:55:04,570 --> 00:55:07,940
found himself cornered.

911
00:55:10,870 --> 00:55:12,550
There are times in life

912
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:14,640
when...

913
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:17,220
everything seems to be
going wrong.

914
00:55:20,390 --> 00:55:23,790
The more we struggle
to get out of mess...

915
00:55:24,970 --> 00:55:27,340
the deeper we sink in....

916
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:29,130
He was experiencing
something similar.

917
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:32,530
Although he had said
in his farewell speech

918
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:36,730
that he would move on
without giving in to change

919
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:38,740
now he knew it was impossible.

920
00:55:40,410 --> 00:55:41,420
Sanika!

921
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:43,700
Are you awake?

922
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:45,200
Yeah.

923
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:47,240
Will you please open the door?

924
00:55:48,020 --> 00:55:49,270
It’s not locked.

925
00:55:58,270 --> 00:55:59,830
Why are you sitting
in the dark?

926
00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:08,590
Sorry.

927
00:56:08,950 --> 00:56:11,050
I know I have caused you
a lot of pain.

928
00:56:11,830 --> 00:56:14,960
Sanika, don’t say that.

929
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:22,550
You must understand,

930
00:56:23,730 --> 00:56:25,590
you are not alone.

931
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:27,950
We are there for you.

932
00:56:30,810 --> 00:56:32,570
Sorry, I was wrong.

933
00:56:35,630 --> 00:56:37,720
I shouldn’t have
called him over.

934
00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:41,930
In fact I didn’t even
like him all that much.

935
00:56:43,110 --> 00:56:44,300
Then why...

936
00:56:46,490 --> 00:56:49,380
I don’t know why
I didn’t stop him.

937
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:54,610
I have been thinking
about it ever since.

938
00:56:58,670 --> 00:57:00,500
What's done is done.

939
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:04,350
Let us think about
what we can do now.

940
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:09,170
We have four days to
stop the next video.

941
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:12,630
The police are doing their part.

942
00:57:13,530 --> 00:57:15,800
But we need to do our bit.

943
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:17,920
Isn't it?

944
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:20,010
What should we do?

945
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:23,180
I know this rascal
is very clever.

946
00:57:23,770 --> 00:57:26,380
He has a lot of knowledge about
cyber crime and the internet.

947
00:57:26,530 --> 00:57:29,290
And I struggle to
send a simple e-mail.

948
00:57:29,870 --> 00:57:31,180
Never mind.

949
00:57:32,510 --> 00:57:34,300
No matter how intelligent he is,

950
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:36,730
he is like any other human.

951
00:57:38,410 --> 00:57:40,280
He must have made mistakes too.

952
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:41,860
Yes.

953
00:57:42,410 --> 00:57:46,610
Just like he extracted our
information while chatting,

954
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:50,690
he must have unknowingly given
away information about himself...

955
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:53,080
Like his real name, address...

956
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:56,200
Something that would
expose his real identity.

957
00:57:57,450 --> 00:57:59,090
We can find him then.

958
00:57:59,550 --> 00:58:04,520
If you try to remember your chats
and tell us, we could...

959
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:07,280
I don’t have to try...

960
00:58:09,140 --> 00:58:11,520
I have actually saved all our chats.

961
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:15,020
Hi.

962
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:17,020
Hi.

963
00:58:17,470 --> 00:58:19,060
ASL please.

964
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:23,600
ASL?
What does that mean?

965
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:26,450
ASL means Age /Sex/ Location.

966
00:58:26,730 --> 00:58:31,370
How old, boy or girl,
and where from.

967
00:58:32,020 --> 00:58:32,670
Oh.

968
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:35,460
So you asked for his
basic information.

969
00:58:36,340 --> 00:58:39,320
This is a normal procedure
when you chat with a stranger.

970
00:58:39,910 --> 00:58:41,050
I see..

971
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:43,910
26/ male/ Mumbai.

972
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:48,020
19/ female/ Mumbai.

973
00:58:49,410 --> 00:58:51,210
Honestly,

974
00:58:51,590 --> 00:58:54,760
I never chat with anyone for
more than a couple of days.

975
00:58:55,770 --> 00:58:57,930
But he was interesting
to talk to.

976
00:58:58,090 --> 00:59:00,050
We had the same opinions
about many things.

977
00:59:00,170 --> 00:59:02,430
So I continued.

978
00:59:04,410 --> 00:59:06,190
Frankly, it was also because

979
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:09,920
I had nothing better to do.

980
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:15,720
Orchestra, college gathering,

981
00:59:16,410 --> 00:59:19,780
basketball, trekking, debating...

982
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:22,190
I was no good at anything.

983
00:59:23,350 --> 00:59:26,280
What I liked best
about him was that...

984
00:59:26,670 --> 00:59:29,280
unlike most guys, he never

985
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:32,400
insisted on meeting in person.

986
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:35,210
He never even asked me
for a photograph.

987
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:39,320
Finally I asked him to
share his photo.

988
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:42,640
This is the photo he sent me.

989
00:59:44,820 --> 00:59:46,530
> You are cute.

990
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:47,840
> Thanks.

991
00:59:48,450 --> 00:59:51,500
> I mean if this photo
is really yours.

992
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:57,850
> Don’t you trust anyone?

993
00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:00,130
> Ok.

994
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:01,310
> Do as I say.

995
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:03,940
> Write your username 'niceguy'
on a piece of paper

996
01:00:04,180 --> 01:00:08,280
> Hold up the paper, click
your snap and send it to me.

997
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:12,940
I wanted to confirm that
the username 'niceguy'

998
01:00:13,270 --> 01:00:15,920
actual belongs to him.

999
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:18,710
Otherwise anyone could
upload any snap

1000
01:00:19,070 --> 01:00:21,970
from the internet and
pass it off as their own.

1001
01:00:25,190 --> 01:00:28,450
So he sent me this snap.

1002
01:00:28,850 --> 01:00:31,860
then I sent him my picture.

1003
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:38,360
> You are beautiful.

1004
01:00:39,980 --> 01:00:40,950
> Ok bye.

1005
01:00:42,130 --> 01:00:43,140
> What happened?

1006
01:00:43,510 --> 01:00:45,210
> Now you are flirting.

1007
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:48,460
> Not at all.

1008
01:00:48,870 --> 01:00:50,030
> It's a compliment.

1009
01:00:51,580 --> 01:00:54,220
> I know for a fact that
I am not beautiful.

1010
01:01:20,910 --> 01:01:22,080
> Yes you are.

1011
01:01:22,310 --> 01:01:24,340
> However much you may try
not to look beautiful

1012
01:01:24,740 --> 01:01:26,450
> you can’t change the truth.

1013
01:01:28,290 --> 01:01:30,220
> Why would I try that?

1014
01:01:30,730 --> 01:01:35,560
> Then why do you wear such ill
fitting, bright red shirts?

1015
01:01:40,230 --> 01:01:41,710
> Because I like them.

1016
01:01:42,340 --> 01:01:43,640
> Wrong answer.

1017
01:01:44,190 --> 01:01:47,140
> What if people don't like me in
spite of wearing good clothes?

1018
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:49,130
> That is what scares you.

1019
01:01:49,230 --> 01:01:51,160
> So you choose to
look unattractive.

1020
01:01:51,580 --> 01:01:55,540
His flirting should have
given off an alarm Sanika.

1021
01:01:56,350 --> 01:01:59,960
Everybody flirts mom...
there’s nothing much to it.

1022
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:01,980
Let's continue.

1023
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:06,550
He must have given some
information about himself.

1024
01:02:06,730 --> 01:02:08,010
Let us look for it.

1025
01:02:13,330 --> 01:02:15,370
Come on.
- Where?

1026
01:02:15,570 --> 01:02:17,340
Come I’ll tell you.

1027
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:18,950
I’ll be back.

1028
01:02:24,450 --> 01:02:25,510
Hold this.

1029
01:02:25,970 --> 01:02:27,780
I’ll change into my
regular clothes.

1030
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:29,970
Where had you been?

1031
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:32,070
Got a tattoo done.

1032
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:34,430
Show me.

1033
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:39,590
There?

1034
01:02:39,860 --> 01:02:41,260
Of course!

1035
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:42,920
That is one place on my body

1036
01:02:42,980 --> 01:02:45,150
my parents wouldn't look.

1037
01:02:46,690 --> 01:02:48,780
Thank god they don’t
ask me to strip.

1038
01:02:53,530 --> 01:02:54,640
> You know what,

1039
01:02:54,820 --> 01:02:58,680
> I think we must share a little
more about each other now.

1040
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:02,470
> Good idea.

1041
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:04,920
> Why don't you go first?

1042
01:03:05,990 --> 01:03:06,760
> Ok.

1043
01:03:07,150 --> 01:03:09,130
> There is a software
company called Crisilux...

1044
01:03:09,620 --> 01:03:11,560
> I'm a senior programmer there.

1045
01:03:12,190 --> 01:03:13,140
Just a minute.

1046
01:03:13,650 --> 01:03:16,030
We must inform Mr. Pawar
about Crisilux.

1047
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:17,390
Go on.

1048
01:03:20,470 --> 01:03:21,560
> Girlfriend?

1049
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,480
> No girlfriend.

1050
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:28,730
> You’re good looking,

1051
01:03:29,450 --> 01:03:30,790
> ...have a decent job,

1052
01:03:31,550 --> 01:03:33,300
> Why are you still single?

1053
01:03:35,580 --> 01:03:37,720
> No girl has interested me so far.

1054
01:03:40,710 --> 01:03:41,930
> Are you gay?

1055
01:03:43,990 --> 01:03:46,470
> I have no issues
even if you are.

1056
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:51,750
> No not at all. What made
you think I might be?

1057
01:03:56,030 --> 01:03:57,410
> To be honest,

1058
01:03:58,380 --> 01:04:00,930
> I haven’t found a
guy I'd like either.

1059
01:04:01,270 --> 01:04:03,430
> So people think I am a lesbian.

1060
01:04:07,070 --> 01:04:08,770
> Are you?

1061
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:11,340
> No!

1062
01:04:13,690 --> 01:04:16,840
> I mean ... I guess, I'm not.

1063
01:04:18,270 --> 01:04:20,090
> Actually I am confused.

1064
01:04:20,250 --> 01:04:22,620
You never discussed this
with me Sanika.

1065
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:24,740
I am a counsellor.

1066
01:04:25,340 --> 01:04:27,870
This is my job.

1067
01:04:28,980 --> 01:04:31,210
Didn’t you ever feel like
talking to me?

1068
01:04:35,890 --> 01:04:37,040
Is that why...

1069
01:04:37,590 --> 01:04:39,680
Is that why you didn’t
stop him that day?

1070
01:04:40,750 --> 01:04:43,380
You wanted to check whether
you’re lesbian or straight?

1071
01:04:44,270 --> 01:04:45,620
These...

1072
01:04:46,660 --> 01:04:48,210
These problems...

1073
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:49,910
gays and lesbians...

1074
01:04:50,750 --> 01:04:52,630
do they actually exist?

1075
01:04:53,750 --> 01:04:55,200
For real?

1076
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:57,460
In our society?

1077
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:01,090
> So that was me.
Now tell me about yourself.

1078
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:04,820
> What do you want to know?
- Well, anything.

1079
01:05:05,090 --> 01:05:07,690
> For example, your future plans.

1080
01:05:08,390 --> 01:05:09,810
> None at all.

1081
01:05:11,410 --> 01:05:13,030
Keep these clothes with you.

1082
01:05:13,340 --> 01:05:15,810
Don’t sulk. You know
how it is at my place.

1083
01:05:24,230 --> 01:05:26,460
I am not keeping that
with me for sure.

1084
01:05:29,260 --> 01:05:30,270
Let’s go.

1085
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:34,450
Sanika?

1086
01:05:35,220 --> 01:05:38,700
Baba you read the rest of it,
but I won’t sit here with you.

1087
01:05:39,110 --> 01:05:40,130
Why?

1088
01:05:41,470 --> 01:05:43,330
When you are reading this

1089
01:05:43,390 --> 01:05:48,190
you only get to know what
we were chatting about.

1090
01:05:49,710 --> 01:05:52,120
But it reminds me of everything
that was going on around...

1091
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:57,570
who I was with, what I was saying.
Everything comes back.

1092
01:05:58,020 --> 01:05:59,360
So what is the problem in that?

1093
01:05:59,890 --> 01:06:01,780
It is very disturbing.

1094
01:06:03,510 --> 01:06:04,590
Sanika

1095
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:06,760
unless you help us

1096
01:06:07,050 --> 01:06:09,320
we won’t be able make
sense of a lot of things.

1097
01:06:09,590 --> 01:06:10,760
Please.

1098
01:06:19,070 --> 01:06:21,480
We don’t have much time.

1099
01:06:22,530 --> 01:06:24,820
At the end of four days...
the video...

1100
01:06:26,450 --> 01:06:28,830
We must keep looking. Yes?

1101
01:06:33,710 --> 01:06:35,810
This just doesn't get wiped off.

1102
01:06:38,130 --> 01:06:39,570
Pournima.
- Yes.

1103
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:42,740
Do you really like him?
- Who?

1104
01:06:43,180 --> 01:06:44,670
He?
- Him?

1105
01:06:46,050 --> 01:06:47,700
Good enough for a little fun.

1106
01:06:51,170 --> 01:06:52,660
To be honest,

1107
01:06:53,990 --> 01:06:56,570
I like doing this to get back
at my parents.

1108
01:06:56,930 --> 01:06:57,950
What?

1109
01:06:58,500 --> 01:06:59,580
Yes.

1110
01:06:59,750 --> 01:07:02,180
They keep a watch on me so
that I don’t ‘do’ anything.

1111
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:03,780
Here’s what I can do.

1112
01:07:11,250 --> 01:07:12,260
Anyway bye.

1113
01:07:12,570 --> 01:07:13,040
Bye.

1114
01:07:13,340 --> 01:07:15,790
> How could you not have
any future plans?

1115
01:07:16,350 --> 01:07:19,080
> I’m sure your parents have
some expectations from you.

1116
01:07:19,810 --> 01:07:23,590
> Actually they have no hopes from me.
- Why?

1117
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:26,740
> Well it’s a long story.

1118
01:07:27,590 --> 01:07:29,470
> Well, I’m listening.

1119
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:34,520
> My father wanted to be an engineer
but he had to settle for a diploma.

1120
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:35,490
> Why?

1121
01:07:35,820 --> 01:07:37,790
> Didn’t score well in class 12.

1122
01:07:37,930 --> 01:07:38,560
> Oh.

1123
01:07:38,850 --> 01:07:41,420
> My mother wanted to do
MD.Psychiatry.

1124
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:44,380
> But had to settle for MA Psychology.

1125
01:07:44,930 --> 01:07:46,890
> Ask me why?
-Ok. Why?

1126
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:49,300
> Didn’t score well in class 12.

1127
01:07:49,970 --> 01:07:52,670
> But my brother topped in every exam.

1128
01:07:52,730 --> 01:07:55,060
> became an engineer, and flew to
US for post graduation.

1129
01:07:55,300 --> 01:07:56,240
> Wow.

1130
01:07:56,500 --> 01:07:59,710
> But I proved my loyalty
to Mom and Dad

1131
01:07:59,770 --> 01:08:03,190
> by scoring low in class 12!

1132
01:08:04,070 --> 01:08:05,990
> So, here I am.

1133
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:08,480
> Second year B.Com.

1134
01:08:08,740 --> 01:08:11,900
> So my brother is my parents'
successful product

1135
01:08:12,390 --> 01:08:14,620
> and I am their failed version.

1136
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:17,460
Why did you say that?

1137
01:08:17,890 --> 01:08:20,880
We have never thought of you
as a failure.

1138
01:08:21,090 --> 01:08:23,840
We never force you in any way.

1139
01:08:23,900 --> 01:08:25,580
After all, not everybody is bright.

1140
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:29,880
I didn’t mean that.

1141
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:32,630
You know Sanika...

1142
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:37,300
Hello!

1143
01:08:38,900 --> 01:08:41,030
What is the matter?

1144
01:08:42,710 --> 01:08:44,410
And Sanika,

1145
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:48,990
Once kids are grown up
parents shouldn't interfere

1146
01:08:49,050 --> 01:08:50,210
That's what we feel.

1147
01:08:50,620 --> 01:08:54,920
But that doesn’t mean
we are not concerned.

1148
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:57,800
And also Sanika...
- Let it be Mom.

1149
01:09:05,940 --> 01:09:07,350
Who was it?

1150
01:09:08,290 --> 01:09:09,300
Nothing.

1151
01:09:09,580 --> 01:09:10,850
What is it?

1152
01:09:13,140 --> 01:09:14,210
Nothing.

1153
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:17,630
Let’s keep reading.

1154
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:23,830
This is our video chat.

1155
01:09:24,180 --> 01:09:25,860
This is my study table.

1156
01:09:26,870 --> 01:09:29,970
And this is my favourite spot.

1157
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:35,970
I love blue so my
entire room is blue.

1158
01:09:37,380 --> 01:09:39,820
This is my door and...

1159
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:43,260
This is where we began,

1160
01:09:43,930 --> 01:09:46,030
this is my bed.

1161
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:49,070
This is my tiny little room.

1162
01:09:49,250 --> 01:09:50,480
It’s lovely.

1163
01:09:51,030 --> 01:09:52,050
Yeah?

1164
01:09:52,680 --> 01:09:53,750
Now show me yours.

1165
01:09:56,120 --> 01:09:59,180
Instead of my room...

1166
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:02,860
let me show you something really cool.

1167
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:09,290
So cute.

1168
01:10:09,890 --> 01:10:13,340
What is his name?
- This is King George.

1169
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:14,890
Sanika!

1170
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:16,920
What is it Baba?

1171
01:10:17,070 --> 01:10:19,040
Sorry, I forgot again.
‘W’ or ‘V’?

1172
01:10:19,250 --> 01:10:20,140
‘V’.

1173
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:21,860
Ok. Thank you.

1174
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:25,130
Who was that?
- My Dad.

1175
01:10:25,530 --> 01:10:27,790
He is hopeless.
- What ?

1176
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:31,710
Never remembers his
email password.

1177
01:10:32,090 --> 01:10:35,260
I kept Mom's name as his
password.

1178
01:10:35,980 --> 01:10:37,460
But he still messes up.

1179
01:10:37,970 --> 01:10:41,450
He forgets if it's Asavari
with a 'V' or 'W'.

1180
01:10:42,660 --> 01:10:44,620
Sanika do you realise
what you’ve done?

1181
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:49,280
You have clearly told him
Baba’s e-mail password .

1182
01:10:50,090 --> 01:10:52,380
This is exactly what the inspector
was talking about.

1183
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:55,130
Giving away crucial information
without even realising it.

1184
01:10:55,250 --> 01:10:57,480
You must have given away
remaining information too.

1185
01:10:57,540 --> 01:10:58,560
Sorry.

1186
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:01,620
Sorry.
I just didn’t realize.

1187
01:11:01,930 --> 01:11:03,420
Baba I am very sorry.

1188
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:05,510
We lost our money because of me.

1189
01:11:05,850 --> 01:11:07,340
I’m so sorry.

1190
01:11:07,730 --> 01:11:09,180
It’s not your fault.

1191
01:11:09,590 --> 01:11:10,630
What?

1192
01:11:10,850 --> 01:11:13,200
It was Pawar on the phone.

1193
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:15,700
He's been studying all our e-mails

1194
01:11:16,570 --> 01:11:19,970
and chats... and he has found something.
- What?

1195
01:11:20,630 --> 01:11:25,180
About a month before
she started chatting with that boy,

1196
01:11:26,550 --> 01:11:27,900
I had received an email.

1197
01:11:28,410 --> 01:11:29,750
What email?

1198
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:35,690
It’s called phishing mail.
- Phishing mail? What's that?

1199
01:11:36,140 --> 01:11:38,440
What do we do when we fish?

1200
01:11:39,160 --> 01:11:40,980
We dangle the bait in water and

1201
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:42,950
wait for the fish to catch it.

1202
01:11:44,380 --> 01:11:46,070
Similarly, hackers

1203
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:49,570
send such mails,

1204
01:11:50,050 --> 01:11:53,210
and wait for the gullible to respond.

1205
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:58,080
We think the mail has been
sent by the bank,

1206
01:11:58,320 --> 01:11:59,590
because it's design,

1207
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,870
the logo, look exactly
like the original.

1208
01:12:04,140 --> 01:12:06,510
The mail generally
goes like this.

1209
01:12:07,830 --> 01:12:09,650
The bank server is down

1210
01:12:10,580 --> 01:12:14,530
and the information of all the
account holders has been deleted.

1211
01:12:15,810 --> 01:12:19,350
So, you need to provide
your username, password,

1212
01:12:19,620 --> 01:12:22,320
and other personal
information, all over again.

1213
01:12:22,730 --> 01:12:25,230
Else you won’t be able to
operate your account.

1214
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:29,150
In fact in such a situation,

1215
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:32,660
one must call the
bank and confirm.

1216
01:12:34,490 --> 01:12:35,900
But this friend of mine,

1217
01:12:37,060 --> 01:12:38,520
Avinash Pathak,

1218
01:12:39,660 --> 01:12:42,610
clicked on the link in that mail.

1219
01:12:44,380 --> 01:12:48,450
He gave away his account number,
username, password,

1220
01:12:49,620 --> 01:12:51,550
details of his entire family...

1221
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:53,030
everything,

1222
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:55,420
on a platter to the hacker.

1223
01:12:56,380 --> 01:12:58,160
I don’t understand.

1224
01:13:00,090 --> 01:13:03,420
If he had the information a month
before he started chatting with her,

1225
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:07,460
why did he wait so long
to make his first move?

1226
01:13:08,350 --> 01:13:10,440
What if we had never gone to Europe?

1227
01:13:11,350 --> 01:13:12,820
What if we were home?

1228
01:13:13,170 --> 01:13:14,660
What did he plan to do then?

1229
01:13:15,420 --> 01:13:20,180
I am asking myself
the same questions.

1230
01:13:21,950 --> 01:13:23,900
I can’t think straight because

1231
01:13:24,090 --> 01:13:26,150
we haven’t slept for the past
three days.

1232
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:28,680
What is this?
- For sleep.

1233
01:13:29,950 --> 01:13:31,700
Why do you have sleeping pills?

1234
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:35,490
Some time ago I was
very stressed about my work.

1235
01:13:36,290 --> 01:13:37,820
I used to take them some time.

1236
01:13:38,540 --> 01:13:40,100
You never mentioned it to me.

1237
01:13:41,430 --> 01:13:43,820
You shouldn’t be taking them
without a prescription.

1238
01:13:44,350 --> 01:13:46,420
One pill doesn't kill anybody.

1239
01:13:50,550 --> 01:13:51,580
Sanika,

1240
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:56,620
don’t stress yourself by
continuously thinking about it.

1241
01:13:58,940 --> 01:14:00,000
I mean...

1242
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:04,700
Although you shouldn't
have called him over,

1243
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:07,820
or given him the e-mail password,

1244
01:14:09,990 --> 01:14:14,870
it's me who committed
the first and the bigger mistake.

1245
01:14:15,260 --> 01:14:16,810
by replying to the phishing mail.

1246
01:14:18,290 --> 01:14:20,510
The rest happened after that.

1247
01:14:25,510 --> 01:14:26,730
Come on.

1248
01:14:28,520 --> 01:14:29,930
Let's get some sleep.

1249
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:32,290
Tomorrow we can think about
this with a fresh mind.

1250
01:14:36,060 --> 01:14:37,820
Darling, go to bed.

1251
01:15:12,130 --> 01:15:13,520
What are you doing Avi?

1252
01:15:13,660 --> 01:15:15,270
I’m going through
those e-mails and chats

1253
01:15:15,330 --> 01:15:17,840
all over again to
look for some clue.

1254
01:15:22,530 --> 01:15:23,960
Is Sanika awake?

1255
01:15:24,150 --> 01:15:27,710
She didn’t respond when I called.
Must be fast asleep.

1256
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:34,520
What about 'Crisilux' where
the boy said he worked?

1257
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:38,610
I have informed Pawar.
He doesn’t work there.

1258
01:15:39,470 --> 01:15:41,670
Which means we have nothing.

1259
01:15:44,620 --> 01:15:45,760
Or

1260
01:15:46,240 --> 01:15:48,290
maybe....we're looking

1261
01:15:49,850 --> 01:15:51,830
in the wrong place.

1262
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:55,590
He has manipulated
her so smartly.

1263
01:15:56,690 --> 01:15:59,200
Her interests, her weakness,

1264
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:02,360
her complex about
not having a boyfriend.

1265
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:05,640
Her complex about her looks.

1266
01:16:07,350 --> 01:16:10,200
the way she dresses...in
baggy, ill fitting clothes...

1267
01:16:11,870 --> 01:16:15,390
Despite living together we know
so little about our own daughter.

1268
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:17,810
How did he learn all about her
through chats?

1269
01:16:17,870 --> 01:16:19,300
Just a moment.

1270
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:21,820
Baggy, ill fitting clothes?

1271
01:16:23,240 --> 01:16:25,520
She sent him a photo of herself...

1272
01:16:26,430 --> 01:16:28,150
What was she wearing in it?

1273
01:16:44,650 --> 01:16:45,960
Sanika...

1274
01:16:46,340 --> 01:16:47,450
Hey, Sanika.

1275
01:16:48,700 --> 01:16:49,800
Sanika.

1276
01:16:50,720 --> 01:16:51,780
Sanika!

1277
01:16:53,480 --> 01:16:55,540
She is just not getting up.
- Sanika...

1278
01:16:56,070 --> 01:16:57,710
Sanika.
- What is it Baba?

1279
01:16:58,740 --> 01:16:59,810
Tell me.

1280
01:17:00,130 --> 01:17:03,580
How many red shirts do you have?
- Red shirts?

1281
01:17:03,990 --> 01:17:05,580
She doesn’t have any red shirt.

1282
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:07,530
No?

1283
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:10,300
Then why did he say that in the chat?
- What?

1284
01:17:10,860 --> 01:17:14,970
That your wear bright red shirts
so that you don’t look pretty.

1285
01:17:15,930 --> 01:17:18,510
You were not wearing red
in the photo you sent him.

1286
01:17:18,570 --> 01:17:21,040
But later we shared
a lot of pictures.

1287
01:17:21,810 --> 01:17:23,150
No, not later.

1288
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:25,420
In that chat he instantly
said that to you.

1289
01:17:26,910 --> 01:17:28,360
May be he said that
just like that.

1290
01:17:29,150 --> 01:17:31,390
Didn’t you ever
have a red shirt?

1291
01:17:32,170 --> 01:17:33,770
I had one.

1292
01:17:33,940 --> 01:17:35,770
Pournima made me buy one
on my birthday.

1293
01:17:36,780 --> 01:17:38,280
Remember when you
had worn that one?

1294
01:17:38,630 --> 01:17:40,070
At the New Year party.

1295
01:17:40,470 --> 01:17:41,530
Where was that party?

1296
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:43,390
Wasn’t it in Pournima’s
housing society?

1297
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:46,420
Yes, I had been there as guest.

1298
01:17:48,070 --> 01:17:50,060
When did you wear it after that?

1299
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:52,980
That’s the only time ...it got
burnt while ironing.

1300
01:17:54,660 --> 01:17:57,280
Do you have any
photos of that party?

1301
01:17:57,340 --> 01:18:00,360
Pournima had posted them.
Let me check.

1302
01:18:01,240 --> 01:18:02,730
My laptop?
- Here.

1303
01:18:05,730 --> 01:18:07,350
How is Pournima?

1304
01:18:07,790 --> 01:18:09,400
Have you spoken to Mohan?

1305
01:18:09,870 --> 01:18:11,810
She’s not too well.

1306
01:18:12,240 --> 01:18:14,040
I am meeting Mohan today.

1307
01:18:14,540 --> 01:18:17,150
What about all this?
What are you trying to get at?

1308
01:18:17,470 --> 01:18:19,140
I have a hunch.

1309
01:18:19,490 --> 01:18:21,300
I want to make sure.

1310
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:22,310
Baba.

1311
01:18:25,830 --> 01:18:27,540
You are right Baba.

1312
01:18:28,110 --> 01:18:29,480
He was in that party.

1313
01:18:29,670 --> 01:18:32,830
And he saw me wearing
a red shirt in that party.

1314
01:18:33,020 --> 01:18:36,640
That means he was stalking me
before we began chatting.

1315
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:38,400
Send me his picture
on my mobile.

1316
01:18:39,220 --> 01:18:40,370
Avinash!

1317
01:18:41,310 --> 01:18:42,450
This boy?

1318
01:18:42,700 --> 01:18:43,960
No.

1319
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:46,130
Our housing society is quite big.

1320
01:18:46,380 --> 01:18:51,100
It’s very difficult to say
if he stays or visits here.

1321
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:53,270
Let’s ask him.

1322
01:18:53,440 --> 01:18:56,320
Have you seen this boy
around here?

1323
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:01,490
No sir, I don’t think so.

1324
01:19:08,190 --> 01:19:11,880
These cameras ... do you have
any old recordings?

1325
01:19:12,580 --> 01:19:13,850
Yes we do.

1326
01:19:21,990 --> 01:19:23,180
Go on, eat.

1327
01:19:24,860 --> 01:19:26,210
Why didn’t you have the juice?

1328
01:19:27,460 --> 01:19:28,900
Should I make you some coffee?

1329
01:19:34,120 --> 01:19:36,950
You were checking if he turns up
on chat, weren’t you?

1330
01:19:37,010 --> 01:19:38,680
Mom I don’t do that anymore.

1331
01:19:39,030 --> 01:19:40,700
You don't have to remind me.

1332
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:44,350
No, I am asking you to try again.

1333
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:46,730
Perhaps he’ll turn up on chat.

1334
01:19:47,350 --> 01:19:48,830
What makes you say that?

1335
01:19:49,860 --> 01:19:52,600
These criminals who
think they are so smart

1336
01:19:53,140 --> 01:19:55,100
they have a common weakness.

1337
01:19:55,960 --> 01:19:57,460
They have a perverted urge

1338
01:19:57,570 --> 01:20:01,010
to watch the oucome of their deed.

1339
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:05,570
The Joshi - Abhyankar murders in Pune,

1340
01:20:05,630 --> 01:20:07,670
were solved thanks to
this very mentality.

1341
01:20:09,270 --> 01:20:11,820
After stealing our money,
uploading your video,

1342
01:20:12,380 --> 01:20:13,920
he will be tempted to see

1343
01:20:14,290 --> 01:20:17,060
the impact of his actions.

1344
01:20:17,170 --> 01:20:19,240
I will never let him
have the satisfaction.

1345
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:20,400
No.

1346
01:20:20,910 --> 01:20:23,290
We will let him have it.

1347
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:26,340
Listen to me.

1348
01:20:27,250 --> 01:20:29,400
I am showing you this footage
only on Mohan’s request.

1349
01:20:29,750 --> 01:20:30,510
Go forward.

1350
01:20:30,570 --> 01:20:33,280
to where the girls were dancing.

1351
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:35,450
That would be after midnight.

1352
01:20:41,610 --> 01:20:42,660
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

1353
01:20:45,910 --> 01:20:48,390
Is this the boy from the photo?

1354
01:20:52,580 --> 01:20:53,740
Didn’t I tell you...

1355
01:20:54,040 --> 01:20:57,820
if he had a bike, we can
spot him in this camera.

1356
01:21:01,980 --> 01:21:03,190
Pause.

1357
01:21:03,580 --> 01:21:04,700
Freeze it.

1358
01:21:06,260 --> 01:21:08,150
Just do that.
- What?

1359
01:21:08,510 --> 01:21:09,690
Make the picture big.

1360
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:12,270
You mean zoom?
- Yes.

1361
01:21:12,700 --> 01:21:15,250
On the number plate.

1362
01:21:18,180 --> 01:21:19,790
Hello, Mr. Pawar?

1363
01:21:22,350 --> 01:21:23,850
Mom.
- Yes?

1364
01:21:24,160 --> 01:21:26,790
Mom, he is online!
- What?

1365
01:21:30,150 --> 01:21:32,060
DT 0466.

1366
01:21:32,200 --> 01:21:34,000
Sir this is the one.

1367
01:21:42,030 --> 01:21:43,730
Your idea worked!

1368
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:45,610
He is coming on video chat.
- Good.

1369
01:21:45,670 --> 01:21:47,210
Tell him you want to meet him.

1370
01:21:47,380 --> 01:21:49,600
Don’t be so upfront...

1371
01:21:49,820 --> 01:21:53,060
Tel him...
- Yes, but you don’t stand here.

1372
01:21:53,250 --> 01:21:55,280
He can see you in the camera.
- Oh! Ok.

1373
01:22:01,370 --> 01:22:03,100
Yes you’re right Sanika.

1374
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:05,890
I should have contacted you earlier.

1375
01:22:06,430 --> 01:22:10,120
But when I found out
that our video has been uploaded,

1376
01:22:11,290 --> 01:22:13,290
I thought you would suspect me.

1377
01:22:13,450 --> 01:22:15,350
I did think you had done it,

1378
01:22:15,490 --> 01:22:17,460
but honestly,

1379
01:22:18,050 --> 01:22:21,560
I knew you would
never do that to me.

1380
01:22:23,140 --> 01:22:24,270
Thanks.

1381
01:22:32,680 --> 01:22:35,290
Sanika give me a minute,
someone at the door.

1382
01:22:38,390 --> 01:22:39,460
Yes?

1383
01:22:42,820 --> 01:22:43,610
Police?

1384
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:44,820
What is this?

1385
01:22:45,070 --> 01:22:46,260
I had ordered a thin crust.

1386
01:22:46,440 --> 01:22:47,410
This is normal.

1387
01:22:48,010 --> 01:22:49,280
Why are you so late?

1388
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:52,460
Kumthekar road was completely blocked.
I had to take a detour.

1389
01:22:54,060 --> 01:22:55,590
Ok here you go.

1390
01:22:56,980 --> 01:22:57,850
Keep the change.

1391
01:22:58,100 --> 01:22:59,040
Thank you sir.

1392
01:23:04,810 --> 01:23:06,590
Call Gautam.

1393
01:23:07,170 --> 01:23:09,320
There’s no Gautam here.

1394
01:23:10,670 --> 01:23:11,990
Does he live here?

1395
01:23:12,830 --> 01:23:15,880
This isn’t Gautam.
He is Sagar Deshmukh.

1396
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:19,970
Ok. Then call Sagar.

1397
01:23:20,690 --> 01:23:23,290
He used to live here
as a paying guest.

1398
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:25,530
He left a month ago.

1399
01:23:27,610 --> 01:23:28,750
May we come in?

1400
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:39,630
Sir, is he in trouble?

1401
01:23:40,360 --> 01:23:41,560
Oh yes.

1402
01:23:41,750 --> 01:23:43,560
What exactly did he do?

1403
01:23:43,940 --> 01:23:45,500
I’ll tell you later.

1404
01:23:45,730 --> 01:23:48,480
There’s a bike downstairs.
MH 4...

1405
01:23:48,540 --> 01:23:52,160
Sir MH 02 DT 0466, Honda Unicorn...

1406
01:23:52,220 --> 01:23:53,670
Get going, don’t rattle away.

1407
01:23:54,190 --> 01:23:55,570
Is it Gautam's bike?

1408
01:23:55,810 --> 01:23:57,180
Sorry, Sagar's?

1409
01:23:57,330 --> 01:23:59,510
No that is my son’s bike.

1410
01:23:59,740 --> 01:24:01,520
He lives in Canada.
- I see.

1411
01:24:01,830 --> 01:24:04,660
So I suggested Sagar
he should use it.

1412
01:24:04,720 --> 01:24:06,490
Else it will rust.
- Yeah.

1413
01:24:07,510 --> 01:24:09,620
Who is he?
He’s my new paying guest.

1414
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:12,140
You got a new one already?

1415
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:15,530
It's not for the money...

1416
01:24:15,740 --> 01:24:17,220
So?

1417
01:24:18,080 --> 01:24:20,680
What if I suffer a heart attack
in the middle of the night?

1418
01:24:21,310 --> 01:24:23,810
somebody should be around
to take me to the hospital.

1419
01:24:25,930 --> 01:24:26,930
Tell me,

1420
01:24:27,670 --> 01:24:29,910
why did he leave
such a nice place?

1421
01:24:30,370 --> 01:24:32,040
He bought a house.

1422
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:35,520
Where?

1423
01:24:35,950 --> 01:24:37,980
He didn’t share his new address.

1424
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:42,360
I asked him to, so that I could direct
anyone who came looking for him.

1425
01:24:42,730 --> 01:24:44,030
But he didn't.

1426
01:24:44,650 --> 01:24:46,730
Anything inside?
- No sir, nothing.

1427
01:24:48,070 --> 01:24:49,110
Tell me,

1428
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:51,420
who used to visit him here?

1429
01:24:51,670 --> 01:24:53,280
No one really,

1430
01:24:53,990 --> 01:24:56,030
but his mother came once to see him.

1431
01:24:58,580 --> 01:25:00,620
Mother ... mother.

1432
01:25:02,140 --> 01:25:03,420
Where does she live?

1433
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:05,070
I have no idea.

1434
01:25:06,530 --> 01:25:09,080
We need to find the mother.

1435
01:25:10,330 --> 01:25:11,700
Are you serious?

1436
01:25:11,980 --> 01:25:15,200
Five million rupees were stolen
from your faher’s account?

1437
01:25:16,740 --> 01:25:18,870
I dont know what to do.

1438
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:20,750
What do the police say?

1439
01:25:21,430 --> 01:25:24,560
Do they have a suspect?

1440
01:25:25,050 --> 01:25:28,180
No, they haven’t
found anything yet.

1441
01:25:28,650 --> 01:25:30,840
They don’t have a suspect as yet.

1442
01:25:31,180 --> 01:25:34,570
But they think it must
be someone I know.

1443
01:25:34,780 --> 01:25:36,820
What is going to happen...?
- Look.

1444
01:25:37,650 --> 01:25:40,250
Please be calm.
Don’t get disturbed.

1445
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:44,470
How can I stay calm,
I am so confused.

1446
01:25:45,130 --> 01:25:47,200
Just do what your mother says.

1447
01:25:48,020 --> 01:25:49,880
What does she say?

1448
01:25:50,130 --> 01:25:51,780
Everything is going to be fine.

1449
01:25:52,120 --> 01:25:53,180
Yes.

1450
01:25:54,710 --> 01:25:56,740
I want to see you.

1451
01:25:57,800 --> 01:25:59,470
Why not?
- Right now.

1452
01:25:59,730 --> 01:26:00,850
Sure.

1453
01:26:01,060 --> 01:26:03,620
But is this your idea
or your Mom’s?

1454
01:26:04,140 --> 01:26:05,240
Mom?

1455
01:26:05,820 --> 01:26:07,230
What has she got
to do with this?

1456
01:26:07,410 --> 01:26:09,790
Then why is she sitting there?

1457
01:26:10,270 --> 01:26:11,370
Hello Mom!

1458
01:26:14,330 --> 01:26:16,060
How did he know?

1459
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:26,650
I had ordered a thin crust.
This is normal.

1460
01:26:26,970 --> 01:26:28,260
Why are you so late?

1461
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:31,230
Kumthekar road was completely
blocked. I had to take a detour.

1462
01:26:31,910 --> 01:26:33,950
Ok. Here you go.

1463
01:26:39,260 --> 01:26:41,230
He got up to take
a home delivery.

1464
01:26:42,210 --> 01:26:44,460
He wanted a 'thin crust’.

1465
01:26:45,330 --> 01:26:46,360
What does that mean?

1466
01:26:46,910 --> 01:26:50,080
Pizza.
He had ordered a pizza.

1467
01:26:50,580 --> 01:26:51,640
Ok.

1468
01:26:52,100 --> 01:26:53,950
Kumthekar Road is blocked,

1469
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:56,600
that is why he was late...
Where is Kumthekar road?

1470
01:26:57,250 --> 01:26:58,270
Pune.

1471
01:26:59,160 --> 01:27:00,390
Just a minute.

1472
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:10,540
Hello.

1473
01:27:11,060 --> 01:27:14,350
Check how many pizza parlours
are on Kumthekar Road in Pune.

1474
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:16,030
And...

1475
01:27:16,530 --> 01:27:18,230
I want a list of deliveries made

1476
01:27:18,290 --> 01:27:20,600
between four to five pm.

1477
01:27:21,210 --> 01:27:23,150
Immediately. Just do that.

1478
01:27:27,260 --> 01:27:28,270
We’ll get him.

1479
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:30,140
For sure.

1480
01:27:31,100 --> 01:27:33,830
Actually this is our job,
you've made it easy.

1481
01:27:35,020 --> 01:27:36,240
Good.

1482
01:28:35,010 --> 01:28:36,040
Yes.

1483
01:28:37,360 --> 01:28:38,600
Whom do you want?

1484
01:28:38,930 --> 01:28:39,980
You.

1485
01:28:43,380 --> 01:28:44,660
What are you doing?

1486
01:28:53,440 --> 01:28:54,710
Do you know him?

1487
01:28:55,580 --> 01:28:57,750
What is this...
What are you doing ?

1488
01:28:58,360 --> 01:29:00,630
Nothing.
We need to go to the police station.

1489
01:29:01,170 --> 01:29:02,850
Come on.
- Why?

1490
01:29:02,980 --> 01:29:04,840
Why?
- Don’t shut the door.

1491
01:29:05,490 --> 01:29:07,370
We have a search warrant.
- Show him

1492
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:12,480
Sir, warrant ... police station...
what is going on?

1493
01:29:12,610 --> 01:29:14,760
We wanted to discuss
a few things with you.

1494
01:29:14,920 --> 01:29:16,020
Let’s have some tea.
Come.

1495
01:29:16,180 --> 01:29:18,930
Sir please.
Just a minute, please listen to me.

1496
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:20,430
My mother is in there.

1497
01:29:20,510 --> 01:29:22,000
She is unwell and sleeping.

1498
01:29:22,160 --> 01:29:24,960
Let me give her a better excuse.
Sir please.

1499
01:29:25,020 --> 01:29:26,380
I will tell her and come...

1500
01:29:26,440 --> 01:29:28,130
Shut up. Come on.

1501
01:29:28,150 --> 01:29:29,240
Sir!

1502
01:29:29,240 --> 01:29:30,730
Mother ... Mother.
So?

1503
01:29:31,430 --> 01:29:33,450
Go on. Go! Go now.

1504
01:29:33,800 --> 01:29:34,820
Thank you sir.

1505
01:29:36,120 --> 01:29:37,260
Sir but...
- Quiet.

1506
01:29:44,840 --> 01:29:45,870
Mom!

1507
01:29:46,510 --> 01:29:48,110
I’m stepping outside.

1508
01:29:48,860 --> 01:29:50,880
There are some carpenters here.

1509
01:29:51,500 --> 01:29:52,940
Let them work.

1510
01:29:57,020 --> 01:29:58,070
Mom.

1511
01:29:58,720 --> 01:30:00,210
I’m stepping outside.

1512
01:30:00,940 --> 01:30:03,090
There are some carpenters here.

1513
01:30:03,740 --> 01:30:04,960
Let them work.

1514
01:30:05,410 --> 01:30:07,120
Sir, is his mother deaf?

1515
01:30:07,330 --> 01:30:09,040
He is repeating the same thing.

1516
01:30:09,390 --> 01:30:10,420
Age... age.

1517
01:30:10,420 --> 01:30:10,460
Mom, 
Age... age.

1518
01:30:10,460 --> 01:30:11,140
Mom,

1519
01:30:12,290 --> 01:30:13,620
I’m stepping outside.

1520
01:30:14,070 --> 01:30:16,530
Damn....There are some carpenters here.

1521
01:30:17,010 --> 01:30:18,500
Let them work.

1522
01:30:20,160 --> 01:30:22,210
Hey, hey! Stop.

1523
01:30:24,460 --> 01:30:25,520
Stop right there!

1524
01:30:27,410 --> 01:30:28,480
Hey, hey!

1525
01:30:29,070 --> 01:30:31,410
Sir let’s go catch him.

1526
01:30:31,590 --> 01:30:33,440
Morey... come here.

1527
01:30:34,740 --> 01:30:36,000
At your age,

1528
01:30:36,700 --> 01:30:37,960
with this paunch ,

1529
01:30:38,470 --> 01:30:41,140
you think you can
actually catch him?

1530
01:30:42,870 --> 01:30:44,460
Don’t look at me.
I know it...

1531
01:30:45,010 --> 01:30:46,020
you don't.

1532
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:47,970
Useless.
Let’s go.

1533
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:51,070
There are some carpenters here.

1534
01:30:51,610 --> 01:30:52,910
Let them work.

1535
01:30:53,380 --> 01:30:54,480
Morey.
- Yes?

1536
01:30:55,350 --> 01:30:56,460
Get the evidence.

1537
01:30:56,900 --> 01:30:57,550
Yes sir.

1538
01:30:57,730 --> 01:31:00,010
Not that.
Give that to me.

1539
01:31:00,310 --> 01:31:02,180
Mom, I’m stepping outside.

1540
01:31:02,950 --> 01:31:05,110
Are you going to do this alone?
Call some men.

1541
01:31:05,360 --> 01:31:06,920
Yes sir.There are some carpenters here.

1542
01:31:07,270 --> 01:31:08,850
Let them work.

1543
01:31:10,600 --> 01:31:13,600
Mom, I’m stepping outside.

1544
01:31:14,710 --> 01:31:18,590
There are some carpenters here.
Let them work.

1545
01:31:58,840 --> 01:32:00,680
Mother... Mother.

1546
01:32:19,950 --> 01:32:22,860
Tea.
- Oh, you shouldn’t have.

1547
01:32:23,770 --> 01:32:26,150
You’ve come a long way
looking for him.

1548
01:32:27,830 --> 01:32:30,270
Actually we didn’t
have this address.

1549
01:32:30,840 --> 01:32:33,000
We had the other address.
- Oh, yes.

1550
01:32:33,350 --> 01:32:35,380
He was staying there on rent.

1551
01:32:35,850 --> 01:32:39,470
I have children coming
in for tuitions all day.

1552
01:32:40,070 --> 01:32:42,940
Poor fellow couldn’t
get any work done,

1553
01:32:43,380 --> 01:32:44,380
Obviously.

1554
01:32:44,930 --> 01:32:48,810
But then why did he leave
the place and come here?

1555
01:32:49,660 --> 01:32:51,310
He said he misses me.

1556
01:32:51,590 --> 01:32:53,170
Children, you know...

1557
01:32:55,300 --> 01:32:57,890
But why are you looking for him?

1558
01:32:58,710 --> 01:33:01,320
He had applied for a job.
- Yes.

1559
01:33:01,480 --> 01:33:03,480
I am here to take him.

1560
01:33:03,860 --> 01:33:05,360
You are late.

1561
01:33:05,830 --> 01:33:07,920
He already got a job
in another company.

1562
01:33:08,210 --> 01:33:10,350
Is it?
Good. Wonderful.

1563
01:33:10,570 --> 01:33:13,970
He is getting a good package.
- That’s good.

1564
01:33:14,500 --> 01:33:17,710
When will he be home?

1565
01:33:18,750 --> 01:33:21,300
Oh look! Here he is.

1566
01:33:28,390 --> 01:33:30,520
Satish, let’s play cricket.

1567
01:33:30,580 --> 01:33:32,530
Yes, hang on.

1568
01:33:32,850 --> 01:33:34,640
Let me freshen up.

1569
01:33:34,940 --> 01:33:37,030
We’ll play later.
- But I’ll bat first.

1570
01:33:38,070 --> 01:33:39,750
Short third man.

1571
01:33:42,690 --> 01:33:43,820
Square leg.

1572
01:33:48,570 --> 01:33:50,380
Long off, long on.

1573
01:33:51,100 --> 01:33:52,850
And I’m at silly point.

1574
01:33:53,350 --> 01:33:55,170
The field is set tight.

1575
01:33:57,760 --> 01:33:58,830
So...

1576
01:34:00,140 --> 01:34:02,720
Badri aka Gautam, aka Sagar

1577
01:34:03,330 --> 01:34:04,690
aka Satish.

1578
01:34:05,010 --> 01:34:06,980
Come we have a lot to talk about.

1579
01:34:08,510 --> 01:34:09,550
Let’s go...

1580
01:34:10,300 --> 01:34:11,410
to the police station.

1581
01:34:11,530 --> 01:34:12,630
Police station?

1582
01:34:12,920 --> 01:34:14,140
What is going on?

1583
01:34:14,660 --> 01:34:15,410
Tell her.

1584
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:18,000
What is going on?
What have you done?

1585
01:34:18,310 --> 01:34:20,870
I’ll tell you...
- Morey. - Sir?

1586
01:34:21,850 --> 01:34:23,360
Mother ... mother.

1587
01:34:26,010 --> 01:34:28,560
Madam, please ask the
children to leave.

1588
01:34:28,840 --> 01:34:31,600
Why?
- Not in front of them...

1589
01:34:32,270 --> 01:34:34,420
What should I tell them?

1590
01:34:35,090 --> 01:34:36,360
Tell them...

1591
01:34:37,080 --> 01:34:39,310
There are some carpenters here!!

1592
01:34:40,390 --> 01:34:41,610
Right?

1593
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:44,930
Have some tea.

1594
01:34:46,470 --> 01:34:47,660
No.

1595
01:34:49,280 --> 01:34:50,900
Five million!

1596
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:53,450
What did you need
so much money for?

1597
01:34:54,680 --> 01:34:58,620
I had not planned
what to do with the money. - Then?

1598
01:34:59,490 --> 01:35:01,990
Do you rob people as a hobby?

1599
01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:04,020
Yes sir.

1600
01:35:05,170 --> 01:35:06,170
What?

1601
01:35:06,740 --> 01:35:09,520
Are you kidding me? Don’t you dare.
- Sir I’m not kidding.

1602
01:35:11,080 --> 01:35:12,230
Sir actually...

1603
01:35:12,740 --> 01:35:15,700
Around six months ago
there was news in the papers.

1604
01:35:15,970 --> 01:35:17,650
about Nigerian scams.

1605
01:35:18,190 --> 01:35:20,650
What about it?
- Sir that...

1606
01:35:21,260 --> 01:35:23,040
so far away, from Nigeria,

1607
01:35:23,420 --> 01:35:27,220
they just used the internet
to steal millions of dollars.

1608
01:35:28,210 --> 01:35:31,020
I was fascinated!
- Fascinated?

1609
01:35:31,750 --> 01:35:34,730
Yes sir.
In fact I studied the cases in depth.

1610
01:35:34,790 --> 01:35:38,240
I read up on how they executed it.

1611
01:35:39,310 --> 01:35:41,430
So, you thought you
could do it too?

1612
01:35:42,170 --> 01:35:45,380
Yes. I have been
successful once before.

1613
01:35:45,890 --> 01:35:47,050
I had made a million rupees.

1614
01:35:47,720 --> 01:35:50,660
Sir I’m sure you
know the first step.

1615
01:35:51,110 --> 01:35:54,370
Identify a person with
a fat bank balance.

1616
01:35:54,630 --> 01:35:56,300
Then get his email id.

1617
01:35:56,630 --> 01:35:59,680
But how would you know that just
from a person's appearance?

1618
01:36:00,390 --> 01:36:03,410
But you know how people talk
loudly in public places...

1619
01:36:03,750 --> 01:36:05,820
...even their financial matters.

1620
01:36:05,940 --> 01:36:07,200
Just a minute.

1621
01:36:07,630 --> 01:36:08,320
Hello?

1622
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:12,490
I don’t want to invest
in stocks right now.

1623
01:36:12,750 --> 01:36:16,420
I know I shouldn't keep such a
large amount in a savings account.

1624
01:36:17,190 --> 01:36:18,620
Yeah. Yes, yes.

1625
01:36:18,960 --> 01:36:20,900
Sir lucky draw.

1626
01:36:21,070 --> 01:36:23,280
The prize is an Audi A4.
- I'm in a rush.

1627
01:36:23,340 --> 01:36:24,830
Sir there’s no entry fee.

1628
01:36:24,890 --> 01:36:26,130
The prize is an Audi A4.

1629
01:36:26,190 --> 01:36:29,090
Just fill in your name and
email address. That's it.

1630
01:36:29,400 --> 01:36:31,610
For an Audi A4.
Here.

1631
01:36:33,070 --> 01:36:34,680
Dad?

1632
01:36:34,890 --> 01:36:36,850
- I’ll be right with you.

1633
01:36:37,290 --> 01:36:38,750
They are giving away a car for free!

1634
01:36:39,150 --> 01:36:41,270
I got fifteen such email ids.

1635
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:42,990
Sent phishing mails
to all of them.

1636
01:36:43,120 --> 01:36:45,190
None of them replied
except this guy.

1637
01:36:45,580 --> 01:36:47,090
I got his account details,

1638
01:36:47,250 --> 01:36:49,220
convinced some waiters
to open mule accounts.

1639
01:36:49,280 --> 01:36:51,060
I was about to transfer
the money when...

1640
01:36:51,120 --> 01:36:54,840
The bank started One
Time Password system.

1641
01:36:55,870 --> 01:36:56,960
Yes.

1642
01:36:57,860 --> 01:37:01,460
I needed a duplicate sim card
to get the One Time Password.

1643
01:37:01,900 --> 01:37:03,960
And to get that, I needed

1644
01:37:04,130 --> 01:37:06,130
documents to submit at
the mobile gallery.

1645
01:37:06,810 --> 01:37:10,530
I was standing outside his building

1646
01:37:10,590 --> 01:37:12,240
wondering how I could enter the house

1647
01:37:12,300 --> 01:37:14,910
... just then I saw
their daughter Sanika.

1648
01:37:15,440 --> 01:37:16,900
He followed her.

1649
01:37:17,360 --> 01:37:19,770
She was going to Pournima's
for the New Year party.

1650
01:37:20,950 --> 01:37:22,930
He gate crashed.

1651
01:37:24,490 --> 01:37:28,460
He had his eyes on Sanika
dressed in a loose red shirt.

1652
01:37:29,140 --> 01:37:32,320
He accidentally mentioned it
in his future chat.

1653
01:37:32,830 --> 01:37:35,940
He had not planned his
move at this moment.

1654
01:37:37,120 --> 01:37:41,360
But he knew he had to
get close to Sanika.

1655
01:37:42,390 --> 01:37:45,980
Approaching her directly
wasn’t a very good idea.

1656
01:37:46,910 --> 01:37:49,160
Chatting would be better.

1657
01:37:49,900 --> 01:37:55,040
But he didn’t know her
username on chat.

1658
01:37:59,250 --> 01:38:02,040
Sanika never locked her phone.

1659
01:38:02,480 --> 01:38:04,080
He easily accessed it .

1660
01:38:04,990 --> 01:38:06,960
Her chat window was open.

1661
01:38:07,680 --> 01:38:10,050
He saw her username.

1662
01:38:11,100 --> 01:38:12,450
Cactus Flower.

1663
01:38:13,640 --> 01:38:14,680
So...

1664
01:38:15,530 --> 01:38:17,850
you went home and sent
her a chat request.

1665
01:38:18,230 --> 01:38:18,820
No.

1666
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:22,100
First I studied her
complete profile.

1667
01:38:23,790 --> 01:38:25,880
What do you mean
studied her profile?

1668
01:38:26,760 --> 01:38:29,640
I checked all her social
media activities.

1669
01:38:30,210 --> 01:38:31,360
Whom does she follow?

1670
01:38:31,420 --> 01:38:33,120
What does she post?
What does she ‘like’?

1671
01:38:33,180 --> 01:38:34,890
The locations and people
in her photos.

1672
01:38:35,120 --> 01:38:38,190
Once you study all this you get
a complete idea of the person.

1673
01:38:39,560 --> 01:38:40,660
I'm listening.

1674
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:45,050
I knew exactly what to say
that would attract her.

1675
01:38:45,630 --> 01:38:47,310
She bit the bait.

1676
01:38:48,760 --> 01:38:51,360
Then you got her father’s
e-mail password.

1677
01:38:52,670 --> 01:38:53,680
Yes.

1678
01:38:55,070 --> 01:38:56,860
He had sent a mail to his friends.

1679
01:38:57,340 --> 01:38:59,060
“I’m going to Europe
for fifteen days...

1680
01:38:59,470 --> 01:39:00,930
My phone will be switched off.

1681
01:39:01,400 --> 01:39:03,620
Write a mail if you
need to get in touch.”

1682
01:39:04,670 --> 01:39:06,440
This was my chance.

1683
01:39:06,960 --> 01:39:08,560
I talked her into
inviting me home.

1684
01:39:08,820 --> 01:39:10,510
Sent her to get something,

1685
01:39:10,640 --> 01:39:12,360
checked everywhere
in the living room.

1686
01:39:12,510 --> 01:39:14,750
Like most people, he had
kept important papers

1687
01:39:14,810 --> 01:39:16,290
in a drawer.

1688
01:39:17,980 --> 01:39:20,670
But you didn’t stop at
getting the documents.

1689
01:39:22,310 --> 01:39:24,680
I had not planned
for the rest of it.

1690
01:39:25,480 --> 01:39:28,780
But the girl had fallen for me.

1691
01:39:29,410 --> 01:39:30,750
I quite liked her myself.

1692
01:39:31,340 --> 01:39:34,230
I gave it a shot
and we had casual sex.

1693
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:37,340
And the video on the mobile?

1694
01:39:38,170 --> 01:39:40,820
I knew I was never
going to see her again.

1695
01:39:41,280 --> 01:39:42,680
That video was...

1696
01:39:43,180 --> 01:39:44,650
just a souvenir.

1697
01:39:45,360 --> 01:39:47,660
When you realized you could
make money out of it,

1698
01:39:48,490 --> 01:39:49,980
you uploaded it on the internet.

1699
01:39:50,770 --> 01:39:51,430
Sir

1700
01:39:51,720 --> 01:39:54,190
money was never the motive.

1701
01:39:55,630 --> 01:39:56,650
Then?

1702
01:39:58,300 --> 01:40:02,950
After secretly making the video,
I wanted to see how to upload it

1703
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:06,180
and transact using bitcoins

1704
01:40:06,370 --> 01:40:08,830
I wanted to try it myself.

1705
01:40:09,180 --> 01:40:11,310
It was exciting.

1706
01:40:17,910 --> 01:40:22,350
Didn't it occur to you that you
were playing with someone's life ?

1707
01:40:25,470 --> 01:40:29,180
What if she had killed herself
out of humiliation, you rascal?

1708
01:40:29,380 --> 01:40:30,280
Sir...

1709
01:40:30,950 --> 01:40:32,250
Useless fellow.

1710
01:40:36,290 --> 01:40:37,160
Sir.

1711
01:40:38,430 --> 01:40:39,330
What?

1712
01:40:39,770 --> 01:40:41,060
The tea has gone cold.

1713
01:40:41,690 --> 01:40:42,980
Could I get it re-heated?

1714
01:40:45,230 --> 01:40:46,370
You want hot tea?

1715
01:40:47,960 --> 01:40:49,300
I’ll give you some hot tea.

1716
01:40:49,750 --> 01:40:51,630
Hey! Take him in.

1717
01:40:51,820 --> 01:40:53,900
And strip him naked.

1718
01:40:55,400 --> 01:40:56,150
Yes?

1719
01:40:56,330 --> 01:41:00,070
How did the police find his
mother after he escaped?

1720
01:41:01,310 --> 01:41:04,170
Initially we were puzzled
about how to find his mother.

1721
01:41:05,220 --> 01:41:07,250
From the references in his chat

1722
01:41:07,700 --> 01:41:10,230
we had cross checked if he
actually worked for Crisilux.

1723
01:41:11,420 --> 01:41:12,950
Well, he didn't.

1724
01:41:13,910 --> 01:41:15,300
So I thought...

1725
01:41:16,070 --> 01:41:18,710
why did he refer to
this particular company?

1726
01:41:19,040 --> 01:41:21,890
He must have said the first thing
that came to his mind.

1727
01:41:22,140 --> 01:41:24,360
People fabricate lies about

1728
01:41:24,950 --> 01:41:27,450
things they wish had
happened to them

1729
01:41:28,610 --> 01:41:30,040
Then I realised,

1730
01:41:30,370 --> 01:41:32,860
he had hung the Crisilux
logo in his home.

1731
01:41:33,430 --> 01:41:34,530
I had a hunch

1732
01:41:34,980 --> 01:41:36,930
that he dreamt of working
in this company.

1733
01:41:37,510 --> 01:41:39,000
I immediately went
to the company

1734
01:41:39,130 --> 01:41:42,540
to check if he had ever
applied for a job.

1735
01:41:43,120 --> 01:41:45,650
I checked all the records,

1736
01:41:45,920 --> 01:41:47,610
and found his application.

1737
01:41:48,010 --> 01:41:51,880
This fellow had failed
the written test.

1738
01:41:52,510 --> 01:41:54,390
That's why he was
not given the job.

1739
01:41:55,190 --> 01:41:58,360
I found his mother’s address
on the application.

1740
01:41:58,920 --> 01:42:00,760
That is where we found

1741
01:42:00,950 --> 01:42:03,820
4.9 million out of what you had lost.

1742
01:42:08,780 --> 01:42:12,000
But the video?
- It will never be seen again.

1743
01:42:12,520 --> 01:42:14,190
I have deleted it completely .

1744
01:42:15,150 --> 01:42:18,330
That boy should be
severely punished.

1745
01:42:21,070 --> 01:42:22,770
He’ll be punished
as per the law,

1746
01:42:22,830 --> 01:42:25,150
but not beyond four
or five years.

1747
01:42:25,590 --> 01:42:29,960
He should be thrashed
left and right in the lock up.

1748
01:42:31,180 --> 01:42:32,790
I thought so too,

1749
01:42:33,560 --> 01:42:35,170
from the way he was speaking...

1750
01:42:35,290 --> 01:42:37,990
as if proud of what he had done.

1751
01:42:39,190 --> 01:42:41,220
I lost my head.
I was about to thrash him,

1752
01:42:42,450 --> 01:42:44,030
when my son called.

1753
01:42:45,230 --> 01:42:48,220
The one who had applied
in your company.

1754
01:42:49,040 --> 01:42:51,130
Yes.
- Yes, the same.

1755
01:42:52,780 --> 01:42:54,520
He needed money.

1756
01:42:55,550 --> 01:42:57,370
It’s been two years
since he graduated.

1757
01:42:58,340 --> 01:43:00,100
Still depends on me for money.

1758
01:43:01,380 --> 01:43:04,690
He has no job, just keeps
applying... with no luck.

1759
01:43:05,860 --> 01:43:07,930
Just sits at home the whole day.

1760
01:43:09,580 --> 01:43:11,640
No idea what he does
on that laptop.

1761
01:43:12,370 --> 01:43:14,560
Just stares back
if you try to ask.

1762
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,680
I'm not even sure he
understands what I speak.

1763
01:43:20,340 --> 01:43:22,240
I hung up on him. Furious,

1764
01:43:22,830 --> 01:43:26,060
shut the door of the cell and
took off my belt to whip the boy

1765
01:43:26,840 --> 01:43:29,210
I looked at him and for the
first time in thirty years,

1766
01:43:29,270 --> 01:43:30,880
I lost the strength in my hands.

1767
01:43:31,690 --> 01:43:33,320
I stepped out of the cell.

1768
01:43:35,130 --> 01:43:37,960
I forgot where I
had left my belt.

1769
01:43:38,570 --> 01:43:41,200
I spent the entire day
holding up my pants.

1770
01:43:45,560 --> 01:43:48,010
But this doesn’t make any sense.

1771
01:43:48,400 --> 01:43:50,970
That rascal,
that pervert...

1772
01:43:51,830 --> 01:43:53,320
he is not your son.

1773
01:43:53,750 --> 01:43:54,900
Not right now.

1774
01:43:59,140 --> 01:44:00,230
This is how

1775
01:44:01,070 --> 01:44:02,910
my friend was lucky enough.

1776
01:44:05,360 --> 01:44:07,460
That's because eventhough
the boy was smart,

1777
01:44:08,600 --> 01:44:10,350
he wasn’t a hardened criminal.

1778
01:44:12,410 --> 01:44:14,610
Had it been an experienced
hacker

1779
01:44:15,300 --> 01:44:18,630
or an organized gang,

1780
01:44:20,170 --> 01:44:22,870
my friend would have
lost everything.

1781
01:44:25,360 --> 01:44:26,410
Remember,

1782
01:44:28,090 --> 01:44:30,160
what happened to my friend

1783
01:44:31,480 --> 01:44:33,630
can easily happen to you or me.

1784
01:44:34,130 --> 01:44:36,350
I have realized another
important thing,

1785
01:44:36,690 --> 01:44:39,950
today's youth live
a complex life.

1786
01:44:40,470 --> 01:44:43,170
It's beyond our imagination.

1787
01:44:44,010 --> 01:44:46,910
We can't judge them
on our parameters of

1788
01:44:47,140 --> 01:44:48,790
right and wrong.

1789
01:44:49,020 --> 01:44:51,690
If we wish to be on the
same page with them,

1790
01:44:52,070 --> 01:44:55,750
we need to transform oureselves.

1791
01:44:57,950 --> 01:44:58,950
Yes?

1792
01:44:59,300 --> 01:45:02,020
What happened to the
friend’s daughter?

1793
01:45:02,220 --> 01:45:06,680
Let us assume for now that

1794
01:45:07,570 --> 01:45:09,880
she recovered
and returned home.

1795
01:45:10,500 --> 01:45:13,450
I have finished
what I had to say.

1796
01:45:15,280 --> 01:45:18,370
If there are no questions,
I will stop now.

1797
01:45:20,480 --> 01:45:22,300
As I take your leave

1798
01:45:22,920 --> 01:45:27,470
I'll say what these youngsters
say to each other

1799
01:45:29,070 --> 01:45:30,570
tc gn

1800
01:45:32,860 --> 01:45:34,050
Didn't get it?

1801
01:45:35,090 --> 01:45:36,860
Take Care, Good Night.

1802
01:45:42,240 --> 01:45:44,740
How was it?
- Great.

1803
01:45:45,710 --> 01:45:47,850
Why were you waiting in the
car instead of coming in?

1804
01:45:48,260 --> 01:45:51,190
I have heard you so many times.

1805
01:45:55,030 --> 01:45:57,330
And then...you would feel awkward.

1806
01:45:57,700 --> 01:45:59,970
I would rather not come in.
- Of course not.

1807
01:46:00,370 --> 01:46:02,210
Why would I feel awkward?

1808
01:46:03,550 --> 01:46:04,700
Tell me Baba,

1809
01:46:04,760 --> 01:46:08,040
why do you tell our
story as your friend’s?

1810
01:46:09,550 --> 01:46:10,640
What do you mean?

1811
01:46:10,660 --> 01:46:13,590
I’m sure it wouldn't
matter to you

1812
01:46:13,740 --> 01:46:16,320
if they knew you were robbed.

1813
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:19,780
But the rest happened
with your daughter.

1814
01:46:19,970 --> 01:46:22,140
That's something you wouldn't
want people to know.

1815
01:46:22,720 --> 01:46:24,110
Isn’t it, Baba?

1816
01:46:24,670 --> 01:46:26,150
Yes, I mean...

1817
01:46:26,680 --> 01:46:29,090
It means you are
still ashamed of me.

1818
01:46:29,650 --> 01:46:32,630
Don’t be ridiculous. Why
would I be ashamed?

1819
01:46:33,910 --> 01:46:36,050
I am concerned about
your future...

1820
01:46:36,110 --> 01:46:40,570
You mean if people knew,
nobody would marry me?

1821
01:46:43,860 --> 01:46:46,380
Dad, please, grow up.

1822
01:46:47,680 --> 01:46:49,610
Times have changed.

1823
01:46:50,670 --> 01:46:52,570
I am sure people
come to know anyway.

1824
01:46:53,650 --> 01:46:54,670
What?

1825
01:46:55,530 --> 01:46:57,970
That it's your story.

1826
01:46:58,990 --> 01:47:00,330
How would they know?

1827
01:47:00,760 --> 01:47:02,870
You get so emotional
while speaking.

1828
01:47:03,290 --> 01:47:05,310
You get involved at every step.

1829
01:47:06,090 --> 01:47:07,890
Now if I sit in the audience

1830
01:47:07,950 --> 01:47:11,030
and people figure out
that I am your daughter,

1831
01:47:12,210 --> 01:47:13,860
they will obviously know.

1832
01:47:14,410 --> 01:47:17,900
Then what should I do?

1833
01:47:17,960 --> 01:47:20,850
Why don’t you be brave enough
to say it's your story?

1834
01:47:21,400 --> 01:47:22,590
I will come inside then.

1835
01:47:22,880 --> 01:47:27,120
I’ll even stand with you on stage
and talk about my mistakes

1836
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:29,150
and how to avoid them.

1837
01:47:29,650 --> 01:47:32,510
But if you’re going to tell
your 'friend’s story',

1838
01:47:32,570 --> 01:47:35,070
I am better off
outside in the car.

1839
01:47:42,360 --> 01:47:43,180
I’ll...

1840
01:47:44,360 --> 01:47:46,280
try the next time.

1841
01:47:48,350 --> 01:47:50,950
I’ll try to tell it as my story.

1842
01:48:02,850 --> 01:48:05,110
Come on. We can't stop here.

1843
01:48:05,890 --> 01:48:07,890
It's time to move ahead.
