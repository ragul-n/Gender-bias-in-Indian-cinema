00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:32,168
Give me 100 rupees, Agi.
The old one won't give,

10
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:35,105
I'll give it back
when l get my salary.

11
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:37,699
You owe me 220 rupees.

12
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:41,171
Give the money,
l'll tell you a secret.

13
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:45,117
The old one said not to tell you.

14
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:49,183
- Did some letter come from mom?
- Yes.

15
00:04:57,897 --> 00:04:58,727
Here.

16
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:12,734
My sweetheart.

17
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:54,644
A woman's life is fulfilled
when she becomes a mother.

18
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:57,983
lf the baby cries for milk…

19
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,177
Agi, are three sets of
clothes enough?

20
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:05,990
Baby dances to the tune
of angel's wand…

21
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:11,189
Grandma, at least this time,
will mom come for my birthday?

22
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:14,867
- l don't know.
- Mom nurtures the child…

23
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:19,336
Living for her is one life.

24
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,213
A child is happy not looking
at the moon,

25
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:34,479
...because that child knows

26
00:07:34,587 --> 00:07:37,147
that the moon will not come
to eat rice with that child

27
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:39,281
What the child enjoys is that…

28
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:43,021
...the mother also becomes like
a child, seeing that happiness

29
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,426
For that reason,

30
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:46,220
she sings... ''Come atop the mountain''

31
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:48,357
''Bring the jasmine flower''

32
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:10,980
- What was that noise?
- Someone broke the radio box.

33
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,250
Someone broke the radio box.

34
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:34,537
Mom…, mom…,  mom…,
mom…

35
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:38,208
Mom…, mom…,  mom…

36
00:08:38,651 --> 00:08:44,954
Mom…, mom…,  mom…

37
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:07,172
Mom…, mom…,  mom…

38
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,914
Mom…, mom…,  mom…

39
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:43,541
God, how many
more days like this?

40
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:47,415
When will my child be well?

41
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:52,083
How many more days
to suffer like this?

42
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:58,621
Don't cry, you're making
my ears burn.

43
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:00,426
l cried so much,
did your ears burn then?

44
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:06,632
You say we have fever
and you leave us here.

45
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:08,036
Do you ever come back to get us?

46
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,441
Fever stopped so long ago
but he's still injecting us.

47
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:15,446
See there, he's been crying
so much that he's laughing now.

48
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,456
Give me money, give me money!

49
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:34,390
Money, money, money,
give me money!

50
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:48,480
How much?

51
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,080
Here.

52
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:31,313
- Hey, which way to Thaivasal?
- Go back in.

53
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:36,118
- Shall l take a piss and come?
- Go back in.

54
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,797
How many times do l have to tell you?
Don't come near the gate!

55
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:44,802
- See you sir!
- But he's going?

56
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:47,532
He is not wearing your
uniform. Go back in. Go!

57
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:03,606
Where's your mom dear?
Where's your mom?

58
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:06,947
Where's your house?
Your mom?

59
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:23,630
My darling, your mother has come,
don't cry, my dear

60
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:26,700
My god! Dear…

61
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:29,238
Don't cry dear.

62
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,783
So, a five- day’s tour?

63
00:14:46,418 --> 00:14:50,320
l also wanted to go
Velankanni Church one day. How can l?

64
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:55,718
Is it true that in Kanyakumari,
the sun rises in the west?

65
00:14:55,961 --> 00:14:58,862
- That is Sunset.
- Ok, come.

66
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:00,324
You go home, l'll go in.

67
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:02,525
No, l'll leave you inside
the school and go,

68
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:04,796
- Or else, that old woman will shout.
- You go.

69
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:09,200
- Your granny... - lf you come inside,
everyone will think that you're my mom.

70
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:11,003
Such attitude.

71
00:15:18,984 --> 00:15:20,815
Why Agi, are you giving me money?

72
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,612
Every day, massage grandma's feet.

73
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:31,888
What?

74
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:54,702
Hey, move!

75
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:57,838
That mad man locked me
up inside, sir.

76
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,315
- Who man?
- 102, sir.

77
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:48,890
Which way to Thaivasal?

78
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:50,621
Ask someone on the road, go.

79
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:54,766
l'm hungry

80
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:57,302
There's a food stall
in that alley, go.

81
00:18:58,670 --> 00:18:59,637
Go, go.

82
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,571
Go man!

83
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:42,207
Hey, what is this? Take it.

84
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:45,345
- Take it!
- lt's ok, keep it.

85
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:47,748
Hey, take it!

86
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,888
Hey, give it.
Give it now!

87
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:22,576
Be a man!
Your wife works.

88
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:24,918
You go work somewhere.
There's nothing for you here.

89
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,655
A mango juice, please.

90
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:38,870
How can l go to Annaivayal?
By bus or train?

91
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:41,804
At this time? Bus is easiest.

92
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:25,175
- What is this? - Nothing man,
we're just talking

93
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,394
- Who is this?
- My boy.

94
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:43,065
He's crying.

95
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,735
Hey, what are you crying for?

96
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:52,741
lt would hurt, no?

97
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:57,411
- Come.
- My purse, my money.

98
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:28,908
Uncle, uncle, uncle.

99
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:31,448
Uncle…

100
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:51,803
Potato head!

101
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:53,262
We have to punch him.

102
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:54,931
Who told you to piss there?

103
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,268
What, wouldn't come
if you pissed here?

104
00:22:57,109 --> 00:22:58,872
Money's all gone,
money's all gone.

105
00:22:59,845 --> 00:23:01,005
Now how to go to Thaivasal?

106
00:23:02,781 --> 00:23:04,009
What're you looking at?
Turn around!

107
00:23:06,651 --> 00:23:09,017
Hey, is Thaivasal this way
or that way?

108
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:11,288
ls this east, or west?

109
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,085
You don't even know this.
How'll you know Thaivasal? Go!

110
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:22,223
Oh, see this.
Thaivasal is here.

111
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:23,562
How could Thaivasal be here?

112
00:23:23,668 --> 00:23:26,296
This is a map.
You can find your way with this

113
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,703
See, Annaivayal is also close.

114
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:32,641
My mom is there.
l'm going to see her.

115
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,837
You're also going
to see your mom?

116
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,851
My money, my money,

Give me that,

00:23:53,298 --> 00:23:55,129
Give it, give it.
How does that feel?

119
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:01,799
Go, give this to your mom, go!

120
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:04,675
Uncle,

You take me to Annaivayal, ok?

00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:12,878
Ok?

123
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:21,959
One for Tansipuram.

124
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,290
Sungadam, one.

125
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:28,297
Samuthiram.

126
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:34,300
- Hey, does this bus go
by main or bypass? - Goes by road.

127
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:39,032
Two for Annaivayal.

128
00:24:39,744 --> 00:24:41,302
You've got 100 rupees.
The rest?

129
00:24:44,015 --> 00:24:45,642
Don't have it?
Go, go.

Will you go to Annaivayal?

00:25:45,744 --> 00:25:46,972
lt'll take two more hours.

135
00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:46,632
Kid, what time is it
supposed to leave?

136
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:48,096
l don't know

137
00:26:49,407 --> 00:26:51,307
Kid, are you going to Sungadam?

138
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:53,443
Kid, are you going to Sungadam?

139
00:26:56,414 --> 00:26:58,314
Kid, to Annaivayal?

140
00:27:02,087 --> 00:27:04,112
Kid, are you going alone?

141
00:27:04,556 --> 00:27:05,580
Kid, are you going alone?

142
00:27:07,692 --> 00:27:09,592
Kid, are you going alone?

143
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:15,527
With my uncle.

144
00:28:17,829 --> 00:28:18,989
l went for piss.

145
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,824
Hey, where are you going?

146
00:28:57,535 --> 00:28:59,503
To see my mom.

147
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:02,497
Hey, what?

148
00:30:02,667 --> 00:30:03,964
We need to go to Annaivayal.

149
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,573
You say you're going
to Annaivayal,

150
00:30:10,675 --> 00:30:12,040
...but you've got
nothing with you?

151
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:13,235
l have.

152
00:30:14,212 --> 00:30:17,978
Whatever l asks, you answer.
That one doesn't speak?

153
00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:23,585
l'm going by Perungulathur,
so l agreed to 100 rupees.

154
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:26,053
Else l'd be damned.

155
00:30:30,295 --> 00:30:34,061
Hey, l've seen your
uniform somewhere,

156
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:38,397
...at some hospital.
Where do you work?

157
00:30:39,904 --> 00:30:41,872
Talking till my throat runs dry,

158
00:30:41,973 --> 00:30:45,136
...you won't say anything.
Is he mute?

159
00:30:45,243 --> 00:30:46,210
He talks

160
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:49,279
What, is he talking?
He says nothing.

161
00:30:50,048 --> 00:30:51,015
A mental case?

162
00:31:44,035 --> 00:31:47,402
- Don't hit me, don't hit me!
- Mental, mental!

163
00:31:47,505 --> 00:31:50,201
- Say mental, say mental!
- l won't say, won't say!

164
00:31:50,308 --> 00:31:55,746
l won't say,
won't say, won't say!

165
00:32:25,209 --> 00:32:27,507
Do you work at a hospital?

166
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:29,637
Work? Nothing like work at all.

167
00:32:29,814 --> 00:32:31,441
Get up when the bell rings.

168
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:33,244
Bathe, no matter how cold it is.

169
00:32:33,418 --> 00:32:36,319
Then the bell.
Then porridge.

170
00:32:36,421 --> 00:32:38,719
lf it's got green worms,
it'll be real tasty.

171
00:32:38,823 --> 00:32:42,054
Then walking.
Someone will bring a cake.

172
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,252
They give me money.

173
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:46,922
Then bell.
Then sleep. Then bell.

174
00:32:47,031 --> 00:32:48,589
Work? Nothing like work at all.

175
00:32:50,435 --> 00:32:52,062
Don't you have a mother?

176
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:55,134
Had one before l had fever.
Then no.

177
00:32:55,239 --> 00:32:58,936
When l was this tall, that wench left me
at the hospital and went.

178
00:33:00,178 --> 00:33:04,410
- Your father? - He ran off somewhere,
don't know why.

179
00:33:05,783 --> 00:33:08,343
Your mom didn't come
to see you?

180
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:09,417
Why?

181
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:13,817
That's what l'll ask.
That's why l'm going

182
00:33:14,058 --> 00:33:15,889
Left me out,
you cunning wretch.

183
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,158
l'm coming woman.

184
00:33:18,062 --> 00:33:20,155
Do you think they'd wrap me up
and take me away?

185
00:33:20,531 --> 00:33:22,362
l'm coming woman!
Oil your cheek.

186
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:24,833
l'll slap you,
l'll slap you woman!

187
00:33:24,936 --> 00:33:27,234
Don't talk about
mother like that.

188
00:33:27,872 --> 00:33:29,635
Your mother didn't
leave you and go?

189
00:33:29,807 --> 00:33:31,900
My mom has gone to work.

190
00:33:32,143 --> 00:33:32,973
What work?

191
00:33:35,213 --> 00:33:36,908
l will know when
we go to Annaivayal

192
00:33:37,415 --> 00:33:40,714
- Your father? - Soon as l was born,
he ran off.

193
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:42,847
He also ran off?

194
00:33:44,822 --> 00:33:46,983
They all raced off!

195
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,734
You're also going to
slap your mom?

196
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:02,396
- No
- Then?

197
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:05,741
To hug my mom and
kiss her just once.

198
00:34:30,268 --> 00:34:32,828
Hey, why are you asking
him for water?

199
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:34,164
l'm asking for a lift.

200
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:39,635
- What's that? - Show like this,
someone will stop.

201
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:43,908
- Show like this then?
- They'll go.

202
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:08,263
- What?
- Can l wear them once?

203
00:35:15,513 --> 00:35:16,411
Oh no, it's become night.

204
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:36,223
Hey, it's stopping,
it's stopping.

205
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:41,169
Oh no, uncle, put down your hand!
Listen to what l say!

206
00:35:41,272 --> 00:35:44,833
Uncle listen to me please.

207
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:47,308
- What is this?
- Thaivasal…

208
00:35:47,411 --> 00:35:48,708
We are going to Kovur, uncle.

209
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:50,303
We are going to meet
my cousin.

210
00:35:50,414 --> 00:35:54,441
Not by bus, as l am writing
a composition about the road,

211
00:35:54,552 --> 00:35:57,578
...which l have to submit
by 6th May before 5pm.

212
00:35:57,688 --> 00:36:01,715
l have to go to Kovur
and win the competition.

213
00:36:07,231 --> 00:36:10,200
Passing Tansipuram now.
ls the SP there?

214
00:36:10,301 --> 00:36:11,666
He's at Rangapuram station?

215
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,603
We'll be there in 20 minutes

216
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:20,072
- Kid…
- l understand uncle.

217
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,874
The reason l'm going alone
is that l don't have anybody.

218
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:26,143
lf there's somebody,
it doesn't make a difference.

219
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:28,013
l prefer to go with anybody.

220
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:29,882
That anybody is this uncle.

221
00:36:29,987 --> 00:36:34,822
He is good, loving, caring,
and creates no problem.

222
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:40,357
Hey, where are your
children studying?

223
00:36:40,464 --> 00:36:43,297
- Corporation school, sir.
- No chance.

224
00:36:47,405 --> 00:36:49,236
Then, where do you work?

225
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,773
- Work?
- Nothing like work at all.

226
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:53,571
Get up when the bell rings.
Bathe, no matter how cold it is.

227
00:36:53,678 --> 00:36:55,771
Then bell. Then prayer.

228
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,780
Then bell. Then porridge.

229
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:58,712
lf it's got green worms..

230
00:36:58,816 --> 00:37:01,512
How long it will take
to reach Kovur uncle?

231
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,447
Another half hour till Kovur.

232
00:37:05,489 --> 00:37:06,979
What're those green worms?

233
00:37:07,091 --> 00:37:09,116
lf it's got green worms,
the porridge will be tasty.

234
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:11,855
lf it's got red worms,
the porridge will be nasty. lt'll stink

235
00:37:28,379 --> 00:37:29,471
those green worms..

236
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:32,344
l told you no?
Asking that again!

237
00:37:32,984 --> 00:37:34,281
Blockhead!

238
00:37:43,127 --> 00:37:44,025
Now what?

239
00:37:44,528 --> 00:37:48,089
- My stomach hurts.
- Stomach pain?

240
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:53,570
Stop the jeep.

241
00:38:10,354 --> 00:38:12,515
You…

242
00:38:14,759 --> 00:38:15,919
Who are you?

243
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,527
Where are you coming from?

244
00:38:17,828 --> 00:38:18,760
Where are you going?

245
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,597
Tell me.

246
00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:25,202
What happened?

247
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:27,268
What happened?

248
00:38:33,711 --> 00:38:36,407
Hey, he's going
somewhere, go look.

249
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:10,981
Why are you following?

250
00:39:11,082 --> 00:39:12,049
Where are you going?

251
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:41,203
Sir, those two are shitting, sir.

252
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:43,610
Hey, wretched fellow, come!

253
00:41:07,064 --> 00:41:08,224
Does it hurt?

254
00:41:11,735 --> 00:41:12,895
Feel better now?

255
00:42:50,501 --> 00:42:52,196
l asked my father for money,
he said no.

256
00:42:52,303 --> 00:42:54,396
Now what will he do?
Come, climb on.

257
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:06,008
''As the cart is trundling slowly
Slowly on the village road,

258
00:43:06,116 --> 00:43:08,744
ln the cart that trundles,

259
00:43:08,852 --> 00:43:11,013
Who is coming along?

260
00:43:11,121 --> 00:43:17,082
Like a swing that's moving
Swaying slowly back and forth,

261
00:43:17,194 --> 00:43:19,890
With tender little hearts,

262
00:43:19,997 --> 00:43:22,227
Children pass along.

263
00:43:22,733 --> 00:43:28,296
ln the sky even the stars
wish to go with them too

264
00:43:28,405 --> 00:43:33,433
With this motley crew,
won't those stars come too?''

265
00:43:52,763 --> 00:43:54,458
Will you go safely?

266
00:44:11,915 --> 00:44:13,746
You'll also go safely, no?

267
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,505
lf the wound bleeds, put some
spit on it. lt'll be ok

268
00:45:35,265 --> 00:45:37,893
Four loads,
l need to move each day.

269
00:45:38,001 --> 00:45:39,434
Ok, where are you going?

270
00:45:39,536 --> 00:45:41,163
We're going to Annaivayal

271
00:45:41,939 --> 00:45:45,431
Oh, the names of the bulls?
This is Raman, this is Ravanan.

272
00:45:46,343 --> 00:45:48,174
Why are you sitting
so quietly, brother?

273
00:45:48,278 --> 00:45:50,041
Let's pass the time,
just say something.

274
00:45:50,147 --> 00:45:53,116
- Blockhead!
- Slowly? l'm going slowly.

275
00:45:53,217 --> 00:45:55,583
lf l go any slower,
we'd have to walk and go.

276
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:01,988
Go…

277
00:46:02,359 --> 00:46:03,656
Hey…

278
00:46:04,161 --> 00:46:07,597
Hey stop…

279
00:46:24,715 --> 00:46:27,411
Please move sir, please move.

280
00:46:27,651 --> 00:46:30,211
Sir, why did you stop
the traffic?

281
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:36,088
- Sir, we're in a hurry.
lf you stood aside… - Go aside.

282
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:58,244
- Go…
- Go away…

283
00:47:01,752 --> 00:47:02,912
Have any matches?

284
00:47:05,222 --> 00:47:06,712
Have any matches?

285
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:10,849
Have anything to eat?

286
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:16,725
Those people, fighting over there,
how can we pass them, uncle?

287
00:47:17,267 --> 00:47:18,529
Have any money?

288
00:47:19,703 --> 00:47:21,671
l'll leave you at
the next main road.

289
00:47:21,772 --> 00:47:22,670
Give me five rupees.

290
00:47:31,915 --> 00:47:33,007
Shall we go?

291
00:48:43,053 --> 00:48:45,419
- Go slowly man.
- Eight more miles, how will you go?

292
00:48:45,522 --> 00:48:46,614
Some other cripple will come.

293
00:48:54,798 --> 00:48:55,958
l'll kill you, go!

294
00:48:58,468 --> 00:49:00,766
Don't touch my stick.

295
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:11,376
Useless leg.

296
00:49:15,218 --> 00:49:16,651
Uncle?

297
00:49:16,753 --> 00:49:18,243
Wasn't l sitting
quietly by myself?.

298
00:49:18,422 --> 00:49:19,912
Why did you come and call me?

299
00:49:20,557 --> 00:49:23,185
They all call me crippled,
so l came and sat there.

300
00:49:23,427 --> 00:49:26,191
Now l can't come any further

301
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:29,728
l'm just a cripple.
You find your way and go.

302
00:49:41,378 --> 00:49:42,606
You're no cripple.

303
00:49:42,779 --> 00:49:45,748
l am a cripple!
Don't lie, just go.

304
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:52,215
Damn that cursed woman!

305
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:55,147
Died as soon as l came out.

306
00:49:55,859 --> 00:49:58,089
She could've died before
l came out, no?

307
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:40,936
Your mom also left you and went?

308
00:50:41,505 --> 00:50:44,872
Dirty asslicking bastard,
leave me!

309
00:50:44,975 --> 00:50:46,943
- Why should l pay for what my
husband did? - Hey, what are you doing?

310
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:49,069
This whore's daughter wants
to get a worm in her womb.

311
00:50:49,179 --> 00:50:50,737
Shut your mouth, whore!

312
00:50:50,847 --> 00:50:52,747
That day our caste girl
cried like this.

313
00:50:52,849 --> 00:50:56,216
Did your husband leave her alone?

314
00:50:56,319 --> 00:50:59,618
- Hey, leave her!
- Just watch and enjoy yourself.

315
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:02,021
- Go away!
- Leave me.

316
00:51:02,125 --> 00:51:04,218
- Brother…
- Leave me.

317
00:51:06,129 --> 00:51:08,427
- Hold her.
- Oh god!

318
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:10,491
Leave me.

319
00:51:12,135 --> 00:51:13,159
Motherfucking cripple.

320
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:15,836
- Oh god!
- My leg, my leg.

321
00:51:15,939 --> 00:51:17,907
Oh god! My leg.

322
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:19,440
Oh god! My leg…

323
00:51:19,543 --> 00:51:20,703
My leg…

324
00:51:21,678 --> 00:51:26,172
My leg…

325
00:51:26,683 --> 00:51:29,174
My leg.

326
00:51:29,686 --> 00:51:32,780
- My leg!
- Runaway. - Oh god!

327
00:51:34,291 --> 00:51:37,658
- Oh god!
- Kill him, kill him!

328
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:42,323
- Kill him!
- Kill him!

329
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:46,129
My leg, my leg.

330
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:52,940
My leg…

331
00:52:01,251 --> 00:52:02,809
Brother, what caste are you?

332
00:52:02,919 --> 00:52:04,944
- Mental.
- What caste is that?

333
00:53:26,536 --> 00:53:28,094
Uncle, shall we go?

334
00:53:33,076 --> 00:53:33,974
Where?

335
00:53:43,353 --> 00:53:45,787
That uncle gave the money back.

336
00:53:48,024 --> 00:53:50,185
Uncle, it's really dark, no?

337
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:15,884
Pity, those two will have to
stand in the dark, no?

338
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:25,807
As the cart is trundling slowly
Slowly on the village road,

339
00:56:25,915 --> 00:56:28,475
ln the cart that trundles,

340
00:56:28,585 --> 00:56:30,746
Who is coming along?

341
00:56:30,854 --> 00:56:36,884
Like a swing that's moving
Swaying slowly back and forth,

342
00:56:36,993 --> 00:56:39,689
With tender little hearts,

343
00:56:39,796 --> 00:56:41,889
Children pass along.

344
00:57:33,583 --> 00:57:37,815
Hey, will you go to Thaivasal?

345
00:57:39,656 --> 00:57:40,816
Ok, will you go to Annaivayal?

346
00:57:41,057 --> 00:57:42,888
- What's that?
-Annaivayal?

347
00:57:43,259 --> 00:57:44,556
What Annaivayal...
get lost…

348
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:47,361
Ok, Thaivasal?

349
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:48,897
Wretched fellow,
let me sleep!.

350
00:57:50,266 --> 00:57:51,699
Drop us off along the way.

351
00:57:52,268 --> 00:57:56,432
Get down, or
l'll go crazy mad. Go, go!

352
00:57:59,342 --> 00:58:03,108
So you just want to hug your mom
and give her just one kiss, that's all?

353
00:58:03,346 --> 00:58:06,509
You see, boy, we're not going that way
We are on our way to Munnar.

354
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:10,215
But however far we go along your way,
we'll take you till then, ok?

355
00:58:10,954 --> 00:58:13,320
So sad, you know?
You climb on, dear.

356
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:25,066
This one also comes with me.

357
00:58:32,909 --> 00:58:33,933
Stop, stop, stop!

358
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:55,896
Go. Go!

359
00:59:50,053 --> 00:59:54,683
l'm going slowly.
lt's nothing, just a small…

360
00:59:57,594 --> 00:59:59,084
She's here, want to talk?

361
01:00:07,136 --> 01:00:08,501
Can you go a little faster?

362
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:10,505
Mom has said to go
at 40 km’s speed

363
01:01:15,138 --> 01:01:19,507
- Come!
- What is it?

364
01:01:22,145 --> 01:01:23,703
Beer. Drink.

365
01:01:50,239 --> 01:01:51,331
ls it bleeding?

366
01:02:04,654 --> 01:02:06,679
Go straight, go.

367
01:02:07,256 --> 01:02:08,655
Hey buddy, move.

368
01:02:37,987 --> 01:02:39,454
What did l do?
All because of them.

369
01:02:39,555 --> 01:02:40,579
All because of you.

370
01:02:40,690 --> 01:02:42,851
- What did l do?
- Please, come quietly!

371
01:02:42,959 --> 01:02:44,324
How? My mouth would go mute.

372
01:06:19,508 --> 01:06:20,941
ls this your father's well?
Come out!

373
01:06:21,177 --> 01:06:22,405
Come out…

374
01:06:22,645 --> 01:06:26,604
Come out…

375
01:06:27,316 --> 01:06:31,343
Oh god!

376
01:06:32,188 --> 01:06:33,553
Bathe, bathe!

377
01:06:33,656 --> 01:06:37,023
Bathe, bathe!

378
01:06:37,126 --> 01:06:38,684
Bathe, bathe!

379
01:06:39,061 --> 01:06:42,553
- Leave me, leave me!
- Bathe, bathe.

380
01:06:42,665 --> 01:06:43,757
Bathe, bathe.

381
01:06:56,345 --> 01:06:57,175
Take it now man.

382
01:06:57,279 --> 01:06:59,179
- Don't want it now.
- Hey, take it now.

383
01:07:00,216 --> 01:07:01,240
Hey, take it now!

384
01:07:25,641 --> 01:07:28,474
Uncle, uncle!

385
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:30,137
Uncle…

386
01:07:32,448 --> 01:07:33,540
Uncle…

387
01:07:40,189 --> 01:07:43,488
You only asked me to
take the horn.

388
01:07:56,472 --> 01:07:59,908
He only asked me to take it.

389
01:08:10,686 --> 01:08:15,123
Each one has company
in this world.

390
01:08:15,224 --> 01:08:24,189
But it's love alone
that's orphaned.

391
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:28,737
Each one has company
in this world.

392
01:08:28,838 --> 01:08:37,678
But it's love alone
that's orphaned.

393
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:42,342
Who would see and
care for this?

394
01:08:42,451 --> 01:08:46,820
Who would hold this
in their arms?

395
01:08:46,922 --> 01:08:51,359
Who would come
to vow a bond?

396
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:55,897
Who would grace love
itself with love?

397
01:08:55,998 --> 01:09:00,435
Each one has company
in this world.

398
01:09:00,536 --> 01:09:09,774
But it's love alone
that's orphaned.

399
01:09:46,382 --> 01:09:50,876
lf you think of me
as one with you.

400
01:09:50,986 --> 01:09:55,355
My heart would overflow
with bliss.

401
01:09:55,457 --> 01:09:59,826
To those that reach
to lift the sad.

402
01:09:59,929 --> 01:10:04,491
The heavens too will
lend a hand.

403
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:08,969
Why are all these
temples here.

404
01:10:09,071 --> 01:10:13,371
lf not emblems
too of love?

405
01:10:13,475 --> 01:10:18,037
What is given to
those who are poor,

406
01:10:18,147 --> 01:10:22,049
Won't all this reach
the hands of God?

407
01:10:22,151 --> 01:10:26,520
For those without eyes.

408
01:10:26,622 --> 01:10:30,786
lf we step as feet.

409
01:10:30,893 --> 01:10:35,387
On our earth.
Who is an orphan?

410
01:10:35,497 --> 01:10:38,864
Who is an orphan?

411
01:10:40,169 --> 01:10:44,663
Each one has company
in this world.

412
01:10:44,773 --> 01:10:54,080
But it's love alone
that's orphaned.

413
01:11:21,610 --> 01:11:23,840
My uncle, my uncle.

414
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:23,162
Lines fall across the land alone.

415
01:12:23,272 --> 01:12:27,641
Who's drawn lines
across the heart?

416
01:12:27,743 --> 01:12:32,180
Do children belong to
parents on this earth?

417
01:12:32,281 --> 01:12:36,581
All this, no more than
a way of seeing.

418
01:12:36,685 --> 01:12:41,122
There is no flower
without its kin.

419
01:12:41,223 --> 01:12:45,660
Only once planted
does it grow.

420
01:12:45,761 --> 01:12:50,255
Without relations
were we born?

421
01:12:50,366 --> 01:12:54,268
Who was born
without a mother?

422
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:58,670
From wherever it is
that we came here.

423
01:12:58,774 --> 01:13:02,938
All those who come
are only our kin.

424
01:13:03,045 --> 01:13:07,607
On our earth
Who is an orphan?

425
01:13:07,716 --> 01:13:11,152
Who is an orphan?

426
01:13:12,454 --> 01:13:16,948
Each one has company
in this world.

427
01:13:17,059 --> 01:13:25,899
But it's love alone
that's orphaned.

428
01:13:26,001 --> 01:13:30,495
Who would see and
care for this?

429
01:13:30,606 --> 01:13:34,906
Who would hold
this in their arms?

430
01:13:35,010 --> 01:13:39,572
Who would come to vow a bond?

431
01:13:39,681 --> 01:13:44,118
Who would grace love
itself with love?

432
01:13:44,219 --> 01:13:48,656
Each one has company
in this world

433
01:13:48,757 --> 01:13:57,995
But it's love alone
that's orphaned.

434
01:14:34,603 --> 01:14:39,267
- What is it?
- lt's mom, Agi, grandma.

435
01:14:45,547 --> 01:14:47,538
Your mom is very pretty, no?

436
01:14:54,356 --> 01:14:56,119
As soon as you see your mom,
will you hug and kiss her?

437
01:14:57,526 --> 01:14:58,618
Shall l also give a kiss?

438
01:15:00,395 --> 01:15:01,419
She'll also give a kiss, no?

439
01:15:03,866 --> 01:15:05,834
Then we'll all eat together…

440
01:15:06,335 --> 01:15:08,326
and sleep without
an injection, ok?

441
01:15:28,223 --> 01:15:29,588
- What do you want?
- lndra

442
01:15:29,691 --> 01:15:31,124
l'm coming, mom.
Why do you shout?

443
01:15:31,226 --> 01:15:32,386
Torture when will she die?

444
01:15:32,494 --> 01:15:34,325
- Whom do you want?
- Number 59.

445
01:15:34,429 --> 01:15:36,329
Numbers have changed.
Ask someone else…

446
01:17:18,667 --> 01:17:19,725
What do you want?

447
01:17:28,110 --> 01:17:29,304
Agi's mom…

448
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:45,784
Please just wait

449
01:19:21,156 --> 01:19:22,919
Where's my mom, uncle?

450
01:19:26,261 --> 01:19:29,719
- Where is my mom uncle?
- Your mom isn't here.

451
01:19:29,831 --> 01:19:31,321
- Uncle, where's my mom?
- Your mom isn't here.

452
01:19:31,433 --> 01:19:32,923
- My mom is here, my mom is here
- Your mom isn't here.

453
01:19:33,034 --> 01:19:36,197
- My mom is here, my mom is here
- Your mom isn't here.

454
01:19:36,304 --> 01:19:38,329
My mom is here.

455
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:54,350
Where is my mom, uncle?

456
01:19:54,456 --> 01:19:59,416
- Where's my mom, uncle?
- Your mom.

457
01:19:59,528 --> 01:20:02,224
- Your mom…
- Where's my mom, uncle?

458
01:20:02,330 --> 01:20:06,699
- Your mom, your mom.
- Where's my mom, uncle?

459
01:20:06,802 --> 01:20:11,034
- Your mom is in Thaivasal.
- Where's my mom, uncle?

460
01:20:11,139 --> 01:20:14,700
- Where is my mom uncle?
- Your mom…

461
01:20:14,810 --> 01:20:17,643

- Where is my mom?

462
01:20:17,746 --> 01:20:20,840

463
01:20:20,949 --> 01:20:25,511
- Where is my mom, uncle?
- Your mom isn't here.

464
01:20:27,322 --> 01:20:32,919
l'll show you your mom,
l'll show.

465
01:20:38,667 --> 01:20:46,574
Searching for mom…

466
01:21:35,190 --> 01:21:37,556
How many kilometers to Thaivasal?

467
01:21:38,727 --> 01:21:40,422
How many kilometers to Thaivasal?

468
01:21:43,198 --> 01:21:45,325
- That many kilometers.
- l don't understand.

469
01:21:46,268 --> 01:21:47,064
He doesn't understand.

470
01:21:49,170 --> 01:21:50,762
Maybe 25 kilometers.

471
01:21:51,806 --> 01:21:53,364
Maybe 25 kilometers.

472
01:21:54,075 --> 01:21:55,440
That far?

473
01:22:13,695 --> 01:22:14,923
Give him one, man!

474
01:23:01,676 --> 01:23:03,473
Hey potato head!
Why's your face always so glum?

475
01:23:03,611 --> 01:23:05,272
l want to see my mom

476
01:23:05,447 --> 01:23:08,939
- l don't know where she is.
- My mom is in Thaivasal, no?

477
01:23:09,117 --> 01:23:12,416
Tell me uncle, please,
where's my mom?

478
01:23:12,587 --> 01:23:15,021
Tell me uncle, where's my mom?

479
01:23:15,190 --> 01:23:16,680
Please tell me uncle.

480
01:23:16,791 --> 01:23:19,157
Your mom is in Thaivasal,
don't cry.

481
01:24:14,315 --> 01:24:16,044
The Puncture Shop.

482
01:24:17,318 --> 01:24:19,377
The tube's gone,
can't patch it.

483
01:24:19,487 --> 01:24:20,818
Go buy a new tube.

484
01:24:21,623 --> 01:24:22,954
Shall l give you a kite?

485
01:24:23,124 --> 01:24:26,753
- How to go?
- lt's nearby, wait for a share taxi.

486
01:24:27,095 --> 01:24:28,926
- Name of the village?
- Annaivayal

487
01:24:42,310 --> 01:24:44,175
- What did you do?
- l gave my mom a kiss.

488
01:24:44,279 --> 01:24:45,837
Did she kiss you back?

489
01:24:45,980 --> 01:24:48,175
- How would a photo give a kiss?
- Then why did you give one?

490
01:24:50,885 --> 01:24:53,615
See how my mom is carrying me?

491
01:24:53,721 --> 01:24:55,746
- That's not your mom.
- This is my mom!

492
01:24:55,990 --> 01:24:58,083
- How do you know?
- My grandma told me.

493
01:24:58,259 --> 01:24:59,658
Who told you that
this was your grandma?

494
01:25:00,228 --> 01:25:02,924
Was it your mom
who came and told you?

495
01:25:03,765 --> 01:25:05,096
This isn't your mom,
this isn't your grandma.

496
01:25:05,567 --> 01:25:06,659
They're all mental.

497
01:26:27,682 --> 01:26:28,546
Nothing happened, no?

498
01:26:29,584 --> 01:26:30,710
100 rupees, gone.

499
01:26:31,052 --> 01:26:32,849
Are you mad?
Why such a hurry?

500
01:26:33,054 --> 01:26:35,147
lf you had waited for some time,
l would've come, no?

501
01:26:35,290 --> 01:26:38,088
Ok, come, including that man,
give 200 rupees.

502
01:26:40,962 --> 01:26:42,987
What, another man too?

503
01:26:44,599 --> 01:26:45,861
Then give 300 rupees.

504
01:26:47,769 --> 01:26:49,669
You!

505
01:26:50,805 --> 01:26:51,863
You beggar!

506
01:26:57,946 --> 01:26:59,971
Who told you to throw a rock and
save me like some movie star?

507
01:27:01,015 --> 01:27:03,950
Not one truck since morning.
Finally one stopped.

508
01:27:04,185 --> 01:27:06,210
Bargained for 50 rupees.

509
01:27:06,621 --> 01:27:07,747
That beggar!

510
01:27:09,457 --> 01:27:11,948
And then you had to come before
l got that money, you wretch!

511
01:27:14,195 --> 01:27:16,925
Could've gone straight
to see your mom, no?

512
01:27:17,098 --> 01:27:19,692
Why poke your nose
around like this?

513
01:27:20,034 --> 01:27:21,023
Scavenger...

514
01:27:24,105 --> 01:27:29,042
Burning hunger all morning,
not even one tea to drink

515
01:27:41,990 --> 01:27:45,858
What's this?
Think l'm some beggar? Go!

516
01:27:50,398 --> 01:27:51,228
Come!

517
01:28:17,959 --> 01:28:20,291
- Leave me!
- Hey, grab her, bring her!

518
01:28:20,662 --> 01:28:24,359
- Please leave me!
- Bring him! - Left it.

519
01:28:25,533 --> 01:28:28,832
Oh God!

520
01:28:32,006 --> 01:28:33,997
- Come, let's go.
- That mother is in trouble.

521
01:28:34,676 --> 01:28:36,200
That mother is in trouble.

522
01:28:37,679 --> 01:28:39,977
A dying man sniffing
after panties?

523
01:28:40,281 --> 01:28:44,445
Leave me, you crooks!

524
01:28:49,624 --> 01:28:50,682
Open the door!

525
01:28:52,427 --> 01:28:53,792
Open the door!

526
01:28:56,164 --> 01:28:57,461
Save me!

527
01:29:42,076 --> 01:29:43,100
Oh god!

528
01:29:55,123 --> 01:29:56,420
Hey, don't hit him!

529
01:32:17,632 --> 01:32:18,929
You have it, dear.

530
01:32:19,333 --> 01:32:20,300
Aren't you hungry?

531
01:32:20,701 --> 01:32:21,963
Not now

532
01:32:28,309 --> 01:32:32,109
- What, you don't like me?
- He doesn't like kisses.

533
01:32:35,049 --> 01:32:38,314
l don't either.
What to do?

534
01:32:39,086 --> 01:32:41,646
lf l take money,
l've to kiss everyone.

535
01:32:42,490 --> 01:32:45,687
oldmen, drunkards, invalids...

536
01:32:46,894 --> 01:32:48,953
My body stinks

537
01:32:50,665 --> 01:32:52,929
even my mother's corpse
didn't stink so much.

538
01:32:53,067 --> 01:32:54,932
Did your mother die?

539
01:32:55,303 --> 01:32:59,069
l killed her, by running away

540
01:32:59,273 --> 01:33:00,865
Only fathers run, why did you run?

541
01:33:01,142 --> 01:33:06,375
l didn't run, l went by car.

542
01:33:10,685 --> 01:33:13,745
A driver stayed
in front of our house,

543
01:33:14,221 --> 01:33:16,553
....for three days
with a broken- down car.

544
01:33:17,858 --> 01:33:19,086
On the first day,

545
01:33:19,860 --> 01:33:22,727
l liked his white shirt,
his white pants.

546
01:33:24,231 --> 01:33:28,497
On the second day,
he asked for water,

547
01:33:29,136 --> 01:33:31,900
and l liked his smile,
his white teeth.

548
01:33:33,841 --> 01:33:35,206
On the third day,

549
01:33:35,843 --> 01:33:40,177
sitting beside him
in his car,

550
01:33:40,414 --> 01:33:42,041
l liked him.

551
01:33:43,618 --> 01:33:45,677
He gave me something
to drink on the way.

552
01:33:46,854 --> 01:33:48,344
l felt light- headed,

553
01:33:49,390 --> 01:33:50,721
l liked that too.

554
01:33:51,759 --> 01:33:55,695
He got onto me and
did this and that.

555
01:33:55,930 --> 01:33:57,659
l liked that too.

556
01:33:59,200 --> 01:34:01,191
l opened my eyes to look,

557
01:34:01,435 --> 01:34:04,029
My whole life was
like some tattered ruin.

558
01:34:05,306 --> 01:34:08,537
All around me, stinking women

559
01:34:09,810 --> 01:34:12,210
saying ''Fresh goods,
fresh goods...''

560
01:34:12,947 --> 01:34:17,145
ln three days 36 men
sniffed me out.

561
01:34:18,019 --> 01:34:20,385
After that, l stopped counting.

562
01:34:21,389 --> 01:34:23,880
That old man came last.

563
01:34:24,558 --> 01:34:30,292
He saw the mole on his mother's
breast on my breast too,

564
01:34:30,765 --> 01:34:32,756
...and chased after me

565
01:34:33,734 --> 01:34:39,730
l ran away to see my mother,
but she turned her face away.

566
01:34:40,341 --> 01:34:45,438
Even when we buried her,
her face was turned away.

567
01:34:46,213 --> 01:34:50,741
ln hunger l began
to stand by the road.

568
01:34:51,318 --> 01:34:55,118
Now all those who pass
chew me up in little bits...

569
01:34:55,489 --> 01:34:57,286
...and throw out some money.

570
01:34:58,459 --> 01:35:02,452
At first my body stank.

571
01:35:03,297 --> 01:35:05,765
Now even my heart stinks.

572
01:35:48,075 --> 01:35:50,737
Bathe, bathe, bathe,
the stink will go!

573
01:38:03,544 --> 01:38:05,978
Take this truck, they'll
drop you in Thaivasal.

574
01:38:06,513 --> 01:38:07,309
You?

575
01:38:07,448 --> 01:38:10,212
We may come by lorry if we can,
otherwise it's bye-bye.

576
01:38:10,351 --> 01:38:11,477
You go.

577
01:39:58,993 --> 01:40:02,485
Mom!

578
01:40:02,596 --> 01:40:07,624
Uncle, mom's photo's gone, uncle.

579
01:40:08,002 --> 01:40:13,599
Stop the truck!

580
01:40:35,929 --> 01:40:39,831
THAIVASAL!

581
01:41:05,292 --> 01:41:07,590
Uncle, where is mother?

582
01:41:26,447 --> 01:41:27,311
Will you go?

583
01:41:28,082 --> 01:41:30,642
- You'll leave Agi and go?
- Yeah, l'll see his mom and go.

584
01:41:30,751 --> 01:41:31,775
Where'll you go?

585
01:41:36,123 --> 01:41:36,919
l don't know.

586
01:41:37,291 --> 01:41:39,225
lf Agi doesn't like his mom
and he hugs and kisses you,

587
01:41:39,326 --> 01:41:42,887
...will you stay with him?
- Ok.

588
01:42:10,124 --> 01:42:11,113
What happened?

589
01:42:14,294 --> 01:42:16,319
A mark on his face, enough?

590
01:42:16,463 --> 01:42:19,626
No, you just hold him well.

591
01:42:19,967 --> 01:42:21,935
l've got to hit his head
with this beer bottle,

592
01:42:22,336 --> 01:42:24,600
Then take him
to hospital myself.

593
01:42:25,139 --> 01:42:27,471
- Oh, ok.
- What ok?

594
01:42:27,875 --> 01:42:29,172
l said ok.

595
01:42:29,877 --> 01:42:31,367
l just said ok.

596
01:42:32,813 --> 01:42:34,246
Just follow me.

597
01:42:36,416 --> 01:42:37,644
- Hey, where are you going?
- Come.

598
01:42:55,002 --> 01:42:55,798
Come here.

599
01:42:56,236 --> 01:42:58,067
- What she is doing?
- Oh gosh!

600
01:42:58,205 --> 01:43:06,135
They are trying to
rape me, save me!

601
01:43:09,783 --> 01:43:14,482
Go…

602
01:43:33,207 --> 01:43:35,198
Uncle, shall we go see mom?

603
01:44:13,480 --> 01:44:15,277
Uncle, where's my mom?

604
01:44:52,152 --> 01:44:54,518
Where's my mom, uncle?

605
01:45:30,757 --> 01:45:32,088
Where's Agi's mother?

606
01:45:33,860 --> 01:45:35,384
Where's Agi's mother?

607
01:45:37,864 --> 01:45:39,195
Will you tell me now or not?

608
01:45:44,471 --> 01:45:46,701
Won't tell.

609
01:45:46,840 --> 01:45:48,000
Why won't you tell?

610
01:45:49,743 --> 01:45:53,577
She is not a good woman.
Mothers are not good people.

611
01:45:55,415 --> 01:45:59,146
Mother bad,
all mothers, all mothers.

612
01:45:59,319 --> 01:46:01,219
Garbage, garbage!

613
01:46:01,621 --> 01:46:03,350
All mothers are good people.

614
01:46:06,226 --> 01:46:08,888
You haven't seen mom.

615
01:46:09,529 --> 01:46:12,089
Mother is bad.

616
01:46:12,466 --> 01:46:15,162
Shall l show my mother?
l'll show my mother, come, come!

617
01:46:15,635 --> 01:46:18,035
She is not good woman.
Where are you wench?

618
01:46:18,438 --> 01:46:19,530
Where are you woman?

619
01:46:20,207 --> 01:46:21,105
Come out woman!

620
01:46:21,808 --> 01:46:25,539
l'm coming woman,

621
01:46:25,679 --> 01:46:29,547
l'm coming to
slap you woman, wait!

622
01:46:31,918 --> 01:46:34,546
You left me and went away, no?
l'm coming woman!

623
01:46:57,811 --> 01:47:02,339
Hey you, wench,
come out woman!

624
01:47:03,316 --> 01:47:06,080
Will you come out or
should l come in?

625
01:47:15,729 --> 01:47:20,325
- Who is it? - Where is she?
Tell her to come out!

626
01:47:22,669 --> 01:47:24,569
Left me in the hospital and
went away, you woman?

627
01:47:27,240 --> 01:47:29,037
You know how many people
beat me, woman?

628
01:47:30,343 --> 01:47:31,640
When you're beaten
you'll know.

629
01:47:32,512 --> 01:47:34,104
Come woman, that's why
l've come to slap you.

630
01:47:36,349 --> 01:47:37,816
Have you ever been
behind the bars?

631
01:47:39,186 --> 01:47:40,619
Have you ever been
behind the bars?

632
01:47:40,821 --> 01:47:43,085
Come out, woman, quickly!

633
01:47:43,256 --> 01:47:44,280
Need to slap you.

634
01:47:44,724 --> 01:47:46,123
Oil your cheek and come,
l need to slap you.

635
01:47:46,326 --> 01:47:48,055
Tell her to come quickly.

636
01:47:52,365 --> 01:47:53,491
Baskar Mani?

637
01:47:54,401 --> 01:47:56,164
Hey, Baskarmani.

638
01:47:57,471 --> 01:47:59,962
Who's that?
My head hurts.

639
01:48:01,341 --> 01:48:05,675
lt's you, Batchi,
don't you know me?

640
01:48:05,846 --> 01:48:08,576
lt's Nandu,
your brother.

641
01:48:09,382 --> 01:48:10,974
Look, your grandma.

642
01:48:12,252 --> 01:48:13,844
Don't know anyone.
Tell her to come!

643
01:48:14,020 --> 01:48:16,147
Tell that woman to come,
to come quickly.

644
01:48:17,224 --> 01:48:18,521
She's in the backyard.

645
01:48:21,895 --> 01:48:23,726
Hey 'Thiruttu muuli' what're
you doing back there?

646
01:48:31,371 --> 01:48:34,306
Oil your cheek, woman,
l'm coming.

647
01:48:39,579 --> 01:48:41,706
'Thiruttu muuli',
where are you woman?

648
01:48:42,983 --> 01:48:45,008
'Thiruttu muuli',
where are you woman?

649
01:48:58,098 --> 01:48:59,725
- Who's this?
- Our mom.

650
01:49:01,902 --> 01:49:04,735
Our mom, it's our mom.

651
01:49:05,272 --> 01:49:08,730
She left you in the hospital
and came and sat here.

652
01:49:09,075 --> 01:49:10,633
Didn't come back into
the house ever since.

653
01:49:12,412 --> 01:49:13,640
Why is there a chain in her leg?

654
01:49:13,980 --> 01:49:15,038
At night she'd go off somewhere,

655
01:49:15,215 --> 01:49:17,911
saying ''To bring
my child from school.

656
01:49:18,084 --> 01:49:19,415
To Bring back
my child from school''

657
01:49:19,653 --> 01:49:21,712
So that chain...

658
01:50:01,127 --> 01:50:02,754
Go away!

659
01:50:02,963 --> 01:50:05,625
Go!

660
01:50:14,608 --> 01:50:22,811
To hear a lullaby,
so many days l've been waiting.

661
01:50:30,724 --> 01:50:38,597
She is my mom... my mother.

662
01:50:40,634 --> 01:50:44,001
My mother!

663
01:50:48,074 --> 01:50:50,235
Mom!

664
01:50:53,079 --> 01:50:57,350
Mom!

665
01:50:57,651 --> 01:51:05,285
To hear a lullaby,
so many days l've been waiting.

666
01:51:05,492 --> 01:51:12,898
Mother, just to see you,
l ran here thirsting.

667
01:51:13,099 --> 01:51:20,562
Ma, when l see you,
l have no words.

668
01:51:20,974 --> 01:51:28,506
Now when l see you,
like a small child.

669
01:51:29,082 --> 01:51:36,079
Who's there to sing
a lullaby here?

670
01:51:36,990 --> 01:51:44,863
To hear a lullaby,
so many days l've been waiting.

671
01:52:12,425 --> 01:52:20,696
When you were bearing me,
did you feel l was a burden?

672
01:52:22,302 --> 01:52:29,606
Why then did you take me as
a burden and push me away?

673
01:52:29,843 --> 01:52:37,579
There was a time when you
bound me with a chain

674
01:52:37,751 --> 01:52:44,657
ls it just that you too
have been bound by chain?

675
01:52:44,858 --> 01:52:48,589
What wound upon your body?

676
01:52:48,762 --> 01:52:53,290
The pain grows in my heart.

677
01:52:53,566 --> 01:52:56,933
My beloved, this sadness.

678
01:52:57,737 --> 01:53:05,143
To hear a lullaby, so many
days l've been waiting.

679
01:53:05,345 --> 01:53:12,808
Mother, when l see you,
l have no words.

680
01:53:13,219 --> 01:53:20,819
Now when l see you,
like a small child.

681
01:53:21,261 --> 01:53:28,463
Who's there to sing
a lullaby here?

682
01:53:50,857 --> 01:53:59,890
Because of your age
l cannot put you in a pram...

683
01:54:00,700 --> 01:54:08,163
Apart from you,
my heart can't stand it.

684
01:54:08,341 --> 01:54:12,141
The pain of giving birth.

685
01:54:12,312 --> 01:54:15,975
Which child can relieve it?

686
01:54:16,182 --> 01:54:19,913
Mother, you are a flower.

687
01:54:20,119 --> 01:54:23,452
That l will cover and protect.

688
01:54:23,623 --> 01:54:31,587
Ma, your ma has come here, ma.

689
01:54:31,998 --> 01:54:35,399
ln the love of your child.

690
01:54:36,169 --> 01:54:43,701
To hear a lullaby,
so many days l've been waiting.

691
01:54:44,043 --> 01:54:51,415
Mother, just to see you,
l ran here thirsting.

692
01:54:51,684 --> 01:54:59,181
Ma, when l see you,
l have no words.

693
01:54:59,559 --> 01:55:07,295
Now when l see you,
like a small child.

694
01:55:07,634 --> 01:55:14,972
Who's there to sing
a lullaby here?

695
01:55:15,541 --> 01:55:23,038
To hear a lullaby,
so many days l've been waiting.

696
01:55:23,449 --> 01:55:31,117
Mother, just to see you,
l ran here thirsting''

697
01:55:53,713 --> 01:55:56,181
Do mothers suffer this much?

698
01:55:56,716 --> 01:55:59,184
Only now do l know
