00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,160
Greetings to one and all

2
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,200
Wondering what I'm doing in this movie?

3
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,360
I've got nothing to
do with this movie

4
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,840
This story travels across London, Turkey,
Pakistan and many more countries

5
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,760
If people belonging to those nations speak
their tongue then our audience won't understand

6
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,360
Add subtitles, then audience must
toggle between it and the scene

7
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,400
That'd cause confusion in reading
subtitles and watching movie. Hence...

8
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,400
all the people belonging
to different countries...

9
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,680
are made to speak Tamizh

10
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,880
So, all the characters in
the movie will speak Tamizh

11
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,240
Which is for our convenience

12
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,480
We believe it'll make
your viewing a pleasure

13
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,400
Also, we believe that
you'll like this movie

14
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,960
Thank you. Enjoy the show

15
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,080
- Hand this file over to the crime branch
- Yes, sir!

16
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,520
Hello

17
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,600
These two persons are the main
suspects in the Algornia murder case

18
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,520
Anybody giving information about
them will be rewarded 50,000 Lira

19
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,200
Announced by Istanbul police department

20
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,080
- Go search that side
- Ok

21
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,320
Come with us!

22
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,360
Get in the car

23
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,880
We have just got the girl

24
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,880
We will find him using her

25
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:11,120
Once I have him too,
I'll call you. Bye

26
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,480
Tell me...

27
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,840
Where is he?

28
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,400
You have got so many men

29
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,000
Ask them to go, find him!

30
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,760
You wretch!

31
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,680
I give you two options

32
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,200
Bring him here...

33
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,880
and I shall let you go or else...

34
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,840
you'll die along with him

35
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,200
All your valor will last
only until he reaches here

36
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,040
Once he is here, you
won't have any option

37
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,440
It'll be action all the way!

38
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,960
The way we planned and nabbed you...

39
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,040
Doesn't that give you
an idea of my powers?

40
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,560
If I can catch you then imagine
how long before I nab him?

41
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,320
You planned and nabbed me?

42
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,200
I walked into your trap to isolate you

43
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,440
It was all his plan!

44
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,080
Then ask him to come! Let's
me see what he's got

45
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,080
He travelled down 6000
kms to find out the truth

46
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,400
Don't you think he'll travel
half a kilometre to find you?

47
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,440
There he is

48
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,080
Tell me...

49
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,520
Whom do you work for?
Who's behind all this?

50
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,200
Refuse and you'll die!

51
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:29,840
Tell me!

52
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,880
Refuse and I'll die!

53
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,160
Say it and you'll die!

54
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,800
Then you die first!

55
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,880
'Few weeks ago'

56
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,160
- Greetings
- Greetings

57
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,240
Shenbagam, serve tea

58
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,680
'The house of the Chief Minister,
Tamizh Nadu'

59
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,480
Greetings madam

60
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,120
Mr. Selvandar. He'll be here soon

61
00:09:59,160 --> 00:09:59,960
Greetings

62
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,240
- Please be seated
- Greetings

63
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,080
Greetings

64
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,600
Greetings. Why are
you waiting here?

65
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,440
I'm not here as
Sarvanan's friend, Deepak

66
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,800
I'm a business with an obligation
for the deputy chief minister

67
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,440
Whatever you are here
for, first come in

68
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,280
"Ocean...The ocean..."

69
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,160
Don't shake your legs, dear.
Please

70
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,840
You're the deputy CM! Why are
you tying your son's shoe lace?

71
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:26,160
My home work, that he did, was full of
mistakes! And I got an earful from my teacher!

72
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,600
Hence, this punishment

73
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,560
Please don't embarrass me

74
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,680
Look what he's doing!

75
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,840
- Hi Deepak
- Hello

76
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,520
- Bye dear
- Bye, dad

77
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,800
Take your bag, your brat!

78
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:37,240
Dad has agreed to approve your
Solar project. He'll sign it today

79
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,320
Saravana, I was totally broke after
the loss I incurred in my business

80
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,200
I would've been a goner had the
situation remained the same

81
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,680
You've allotted me this 40 billion rupees
project for the sake of our friendship

82
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,320
I will never, ever forget this help

83
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,000
Deepak, my dad's the chief minister

84
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:53,520
Yet, I had never asked him any
favor nor did he do me any favor

85
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,200
This is the first time and
that too for your sake

86
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:59,240
Don't I know that? I even know the big players
in the market, who were pitching for this

87
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:02,120
Yet you are the
reason why I got this

88
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,160
All this sounds good

89
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,400
So, remember this help, work
hard and save my reputation

90
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,600
Come, let's go meet my dad

91
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,600
Welcome

92
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,840
Look here, I'm signing
your documents

93
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:17,400
These are the last documents I'm
approving as a Chief minister

94
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,440
Why would you say that, uncle?

95
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,800
- Didn't he tell you?
- No

96
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,000
In upcoming elections, we'll win and I'll
announce Saravanan as the chief minister...

97
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,760
and I'm planning to
quit politics for good

98
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,600
How long do people like me block
the way and be an obstacle?

99
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,760
It's time the young people took charge

100
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,560
Here you go. The government
handovers this project to you

101
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,640
Stay true to God and execute
this project very well

102
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,120
Sure!

103
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,440
- Deepak, your arrival has brought us good news
- What's that?

104
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,960
In the upcoming election, our 'Makkal
Sakthi Kazhagam' - MSK party...

105
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,720
and the 'India Desiya Murpokku' - IPD party
are forming alliance for the first time

106
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,920
And for the first election campaign
conference of this alliance...

107
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,240
national leader, Gupta ji is coming
down to our state on the 10th

108
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:53,960
Is it?

109
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,960
Yes, dad. Only 12 more days to go

110
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,200
We must make all the necessary
arrangements to make it grand

111
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,680
Let me bear the expenses for the conference
hall, dias and catering services

112
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,960
- Bribing us for approving the tender for you?
- Oh! Come on. I didn't mean that

113
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,680
Then?

114
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,080
Look here, Deepak...

115
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,680
One who dares to steals will
eventually end up being a beggar

116
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,960
One who feels begging
is an insult will steal

117
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,240
One who does both these
will accept bribes

118
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:18,480
So, just take care of the project that
government has approved you to do

119
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:21,240
The party people will take
care of the conference

120
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,600
Uncle...Uncle! Uncle!

121
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,720
I didn't mean that way

122
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,800
Politics and government
are two different things

123
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:29,600
Saravana, I have started a
new AC manufacturing unit

124
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,240
If you have no concerns...

125
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,880
at least let me provide ACs
for the conference hall

126
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,880
You may provide the ACs but before that
make sure you collect the amount for it

127
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,640
Ok

128
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,640
Hello

129
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,320
What?

130
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,880
I'm Lieutenant General M J Rehman

131
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,520
Your son, Subash's chief

132
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,840
This is Diya

133
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,880
Colonel Subash's partner in the operation
he led. Come, let's go see Subash

134
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,640
What happened to my brother?

135
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,280
An operation was planned two days ago to
clear the terrorist campaign in border

136
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,920
The operation was successful

137
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,280
But while returning, Subash
got shot unexpectedly

138
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,640
Subash! Look at him, oh my God!

139
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,120
What happened, my dear?

140
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,840
He has been in comatose
since two days

141
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,280
- Nothing to worry
- Don't worry, dad

142
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,400
- Nothing will happen to him
- Dear brother-in-law!

143
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,120
Did I fly all the way down from
Turkey to see you in this condition?

144
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,680
Oh my dear brother-in-law!
Look at your condition!

145
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,240
You deserve this!

146
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,760
Did you think I'm here out
of the love I have for you?

147
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,840
I'm here to watch and enjoy as your
body will be carried in a coffin!

148
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,880
Dear sister, look at the affection
your husband has for Subash

149
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,720
Obvious, isn't it? After
all they are classmates

150
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:57,120
Dear brother-in-law, if I ever get
hold of the guy who shot you...

151
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,560
I'll idolize him! That's how
much I'm furious with you!

152
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,080
Imagine all the tough times you gave me

153
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,400
Dear sister, please! Don't marry him!

154
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:08,400
Look here! Don't create a ruckus in this
marriage after arriving at the last minute

155
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,640
Quiet dear sister-in-law! Dear sister,
please don't marry him and ruin your life!

156
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,640
He is a fool! He was my senior in
college, failed and became my classmate

157
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,640
Your sister ain't left
over food to get ruined!

158
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,560
She is like fresh food!

159
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,120
You call me a fool? I'm not the one who's
roaming in borders with a gun, like you!

160
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,000
I work in an embassy abroad,
in a posh office! Got it?

161
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,600
Dear sister, look at this teeth!
You still want to marry him?

162
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,040
It's not my teeth that she fell for

163
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,880
It's my skill she fell for.
Isn't it, baby?

164
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,440
Look! This marriage is
happening with her consent

165
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,640
You keep quiet. Go
ahead, tie the knot

166
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,840
I won't agree! I just won't agree!

167
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,800
Don't you tie the knot! You heard me!
Don't you tie the knot!

168
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,800
Subash, what's wrong with you?

169
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,960
There! I tied the knot

170
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,000
He just tied the knot! You...

171
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,520
After wedding the groom spends
the night with the bride

172
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,840
But you made me spend the
night at a dental hospital!

173
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,400
- Excuse me, the patient needs to rest
- Ok, doctor

174
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,560
Let the patient rest.
Please control him

175
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,560
- Dear brother-in-law!
- Nurse...

176
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,920
I'm going to meet the chief doctor.
Please get me the reports

177
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,840
Yes, doctor

178
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,680
Look what you did, dear

179
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,760
I prayed for you at our deity's
temple and got you this Kumkum

180
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,800
Look...

181
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,520
nothing will happen to you

182
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,000
I was impressed by you when I saw you going
crazy and tried to stop your sister's marriage

183
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,640
I fell for you right at that moment

184
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,720
But I couldn't confess
that to you in person

185
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,080
I get nervous every time I see you

186
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:49,520
I remember the first time I came to your room.
It was three months ago, on your birthday

187
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,720
I was confident that I'll
confess my love for you

188
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,920
But you were asleep

189
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,440
I didn't know what to do

190
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,360
So, out of love, I kissed you

191
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,960
I kissed you on that day saying
the three words - 'I love you'

192
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,640
You don't even know that

193
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:14,000
Today, again I'm going to kiss you saying
another three words - 'Get well soon'

194
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,640
And you won't even know this

195
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,920
Madam, please don't disturb the patient

196
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:27,880
Oh! Come on! Couldn't you've come two
seconds late? I just missed a kiss!

197
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,960
I agreed to play along with Subash because
he compelled me a lot. Really sorry

198
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,840
What kind of childish-ness is this?

199
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,680
An operation to clear terrorist
camp in Poonch. 45 terrorists...

200
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,800
and we pulled off the mission
with zero causalities

201
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:51,400
So, in two days I will be awarded
the gallantry award, Kirti chakra

202
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,960
Politics never allowed you guys to attend
when I won medals in school and college

203
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,360
Hence, I staged a drama

204
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:00,760
Not just that. Three days relief for you
from your political life. Hence, I lied

205
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,120
You pulled it off really well!

206
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,160
You almost gave us
all a heart attack

207
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,360
In a way it benefited me

208
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,040
Also, I found out what
everyone thinks of me

209
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,360
Like you lied, whatever
I said was also a lie!

210
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,560
- Su...
- Please no!

211
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,440
- Superb!
- Thanks dear, brother-in-law

212
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:34,240
Terrorists like Syed Ibrahim
Malik, who stay in Pakistan...

213
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:37,600
are the ones bringing bad
reputation to our nation

214
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:42,240
Malik is not just a global terrorist but
also a most wanted criminal by the Interpol

215
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:46,400
If they say, they want to send
Mallik out from Pakisthan

216
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:51,960
...as an opposition leader, I warn you
that I'll start my fasting unto death

217
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:55,360
My question to the current government
is that are they supporting Malik?

218
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,960
And thereby are they promoting
terrorism indirectly?

219
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,840
If they don't chase him away within a
week then we will stage a protest!

220
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,000
Stop! Who are you? Where
are you coming from?

221
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,080
- What's in your bag?
- Look! Over there!

222
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,760
- Please leave me! Leave me!
- Stop! Catch him!

223
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,400
- Leave me!
- Catch him!

224
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,960
Stop! Don't go there!

225
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,440
Who are you? What's going on?

226
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,560
- Greetings
- Greetings

227
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,800
Malik!

228
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,240
How dare you blast bomb in our country?

229
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,000
Just because we let you live here...

230
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:08,880
don't think the Pakistan government will
be a mute spectator to your atrocities!

231
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,160
If we call off your security
for even a second...

232
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,080
the Indian government will hunt
you down and finish you off!

233
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,160
Duplicate rascal!

234
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,520
You squint eyes! Where is the real Malik?

235
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,480
Tahir!

236
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:41,920
You've known us for years. Can't you still
differentiate between him and myself?

237
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,160
- Forget that! Whatever you did has...
- Tahir!

238
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,360
Tahir...

239
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,640
Of late if anyone challenges me...

240
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,240
or raises their voice; it irks me a lot

241
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:57,200
You have finished off the opposition party
leader! It's has become a major issue

242
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,520
I carried out 17 blasts in
my country, for you guys

243
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:06,360
For my sake, can't I do
it once in your country?

244
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,400
You or your government
aren't guarding me for free!

245
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,080
You guys are just working for the
millions of money I pay you!

246
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,560
So mind your business,
that of a watchman!

247
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:17,920
Leave!

248
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,800
Listen, Tahir!

249
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,440
Don't forget...

250
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,520
I am an NRI

251
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,040
Non Reliable Indian!

252
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,280
See you!

253
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:38,040
Dear brothers and sisters, I am
really happy to see you all here

254
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:42,160
Initially Malik used to respect us a lot
but now he shows no respect at all!

255
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,760
When will see his end?

256
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,520
- Soon
- When, sir?

257
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,880
Elections are about to happen in India

258
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,960
IPDP's leader, Indra Gupta ji...

259
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:54,560
is set to be the next prime minister
according to all the opinion polls

260
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,920
If he becomes the prime minister...

261
00:20:55,960 --> 00:21:01,000
then no matter where Malik is, in
Pakistan or any corner of the world...

262
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,080
he won't spare him!

263
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,480
I promise you all...

264
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,600
that India's most wanted criminal...

265
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:10,440
Syed Ibrahim Malik will be arrested
and brought to India in 30 days time

266
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,400
If anyone will still try to
spread terrorism in my nation...

267
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,760
- then we will give them an apt reply!
- Ji, what a overwhelming response!

268
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,880
Are you watching it?

269
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,440
This is not very important

270
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,680
Our parties alliance conference in
Tamil Nadu is what matters the most

271
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,080
Don't worry. Our conference
will be a success

272
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:25,920
Then...

273
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,720
from the list of regions
you gave us...

274
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,640
Krishnagiri and Sri Perambudur
are the ones posing issues

275
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,920
I'll talk to Gupta ji and get it sorted.
You take care of the proceedings

276
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,240
- Ok ji. Hey! Don't cheat grandpa
- Careful!

277
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,640
Thanks a lot, dear

278
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,880
The political pressure had wiped off
your dad's and brother's peace of mind

279
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,280
All this happiness is because of your plan

280
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,080
Coffee

281
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,640
Dear sister-in-law,
you know me so well

282
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,120
Yet, didn't you tell your sister
that I prefer tea over coffee?

283
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,160
Now, go! Get me a cup of tea

284
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:05,480
Why are you standing so far away? Expect
me to use a straw to drink the tea?

285
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,440
Come closer

286
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,280
Listen Ms.Pop-eye!

287
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,240
You didn't complete the
kiss the other day at hospital

288
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,280
Kiss me now

289
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,760
No, only after marriage

290
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,520
But will your husband allow it?

291
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,240
Just kidding

292
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,680
Stop showing off. Just one kiss.
Kiss me

293
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,120
- No, I won't
- Kiss?

294
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:23,880
I feel shy

295
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,880
Mr. Army man is trying to woo someone.
I must not let it happen!

296
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,520
Then why did you kiss me before that?

297
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,200
That day, you were sleeping

298
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,200
That was without my knowledge.
Now, kiss me when I'm awake

299
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,760
The kiss mark is still
fresh from that day

300
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,320
First find that kiss mark

301
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,440
Then I shall oblige to
whatever you ask of me

302
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:42,360
The kiss mark from three
months back is still fresh?

303
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,600
I overheard everything!

304
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,120
- Kiss? Kiss mark? What's going on?
- Well...

305
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,040
We were just enacting a movie
scene using Tik Tok app

306
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,200
You think you can trick me?

307
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,800
Which movie has these dialogues?

308
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,280
Don't you think while you blink!
Answer me, now!

309
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,040
Lion King

310
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:57,840
Lion King?

311
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,760
That's an English movie but
weren't you speaking Tamizh?

312
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,960
- Answer me! Tamizh imposition?
- Hold this

313
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:03,800
Answer me, now!

314
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,640
Invading others privacy is
so easy for you, isn't it?

315
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,480
Look here...

316
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,840
I've been noticing you. You don't
seem to have a limit on your tongue

317
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:14,960
Come again? You'll enjoy as my
body will be carried in a coffin?

318
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,240
You'll idolize the guy who shoots me?

319
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:23,040
Until you're here, make sure that
you don't show me your face again!

320
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,400
Get lost!

321
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,080
I've a doubt

322
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,280
What is it?

323
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,480
What's with a kiss mark that
doesn't fade away in three months?

324
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,000
I know you'll bash me for asking this

325
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:31,720
I won't ask

326
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,600
- Get lost!
- My bad, shouldn't have interfered

327
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,960
Baby, where are you?

328
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,280
Kiss mark is still fresh
even after three months?

329
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,920
Who do you think you are?

330
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,360
Why do you keep fighting with
my brother and avoid him?

331
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,240
Baby...

332
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,720
I not fighting with him and avoiding him

333
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,560
I'm avoiding him to
avoid fighting with him

334
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:49,160
He has been bashing me up for 10 years now!
What does he think of me?

335
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,120
He is the youngest and
so he was pampered a lot

336
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,680
So, adjust and oblige
to anything he asks for

337
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,280
Just oblige to anything he asks for.
Now, get lost!

338
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,120
Ms. Pop-eye!

339
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,440
Even the vote ink fades
away in a week's time

340
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,520
And you say a kiss mark stays
fresh for three months?

341
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,320
- Stop bluffing
- It's true

342
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,040
Find it

343
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,280
Is it so?

344
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,280
In that case...

345
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,080
kiss me now and I'll check
if the kiss mark stays

346
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:15,560
No, I won't

347
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,960
Kiss me or else I'll kiss you

348
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,400
And I'll kiss you blindly,
anywhere I want. Kiss me

349
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,200
Feeling shy?

350
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,160
Fine...

351
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,240
I'll close my eyes

352
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,400
Kiss me! Quick!

353
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,800
A kiss?

354
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:31,800
From me?

355
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,480
I'll count to three. Kiss
me or else I'll bite you!

356
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,840
Lusty fellow!

357
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,320
You are wilder than your sister!

358
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,040
One!

359
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,560
Just oblige to anything he asks for

360
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,880
- I'll oblige!
- Two!

361
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,120
Three!

362
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,920
How was that dear, brother-in-law?

363
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,560
- You? Why did you kiss me?
- It was your sister's order

364
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,720
She said it but where
did your brains go?

365
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,760
Can you hear me now? You...

366
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,520
Varma ji is calling

367
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,200
Hello

368
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,320
RKS, cancel our conference meet

369
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,520
Why? What happened?

370
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,560
A report from the intelligence.
Seems like life threat on Gupta ji

371
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,160
Hence...

372
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,480
If this meet doesn't take place then it'll
trigger a chaos amongst out party people

373
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,280
The media will roast us

374
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,280
Don't you worry. Tamizh
Nadu is a peaceful land

375
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,320
We will take care. Ok?

376
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,040
Please don't cancel the meeting

377
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,240
Since you have taken the
responsibility, I agree to it

378
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,240
Thank you! Thank you, ji!

379
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:41,960
Now, Mr. Jayaram Shukla, 2012
batch Dehradun regiment...

380
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:45,920
will receive the gallantry award
from the honourable minister

381
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,960
I never expected this. I'm so happy!

382
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,200
Hey Diya! Diya!

383
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,480
Did you get it?

384
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,520
Give it to me

385
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,200
For whom is this ring?

386
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,000
Surprise

387
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,280
Wait for 10 minutes

388
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,960
Come on, it's not a surprise

389
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,400
We have been in the same
regiment for 3 years

390
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,440
Don't I know what's in your heart?

391
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,680
What's with all these
formalities to propose me?

392
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,920
Let me confess first...

393
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:27,000
She is on a separate love track
without realizing what's going on!

394
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,200
Looks like only tall, dark and
handsome get beautiful girls

395
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,040
Now I call...

396
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:36,360
Colonel Subash, 2013
batch, Ooty regiment...

397
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,920
to receive the gallantry
award, Kirti Chakra

398
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,080
Go!

399
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,840
Give me a kiss

400
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,080
Colonel Subash!

401
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,280
Colonel Subash!

402
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,920
Where is he?

403
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,480
Colonel Subash!

404
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,760
Where did he disappear?

405
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,720
Please come on the stage

406
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,720
Dear brother...

407
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,760
wipe off that lipstick!

408
00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:03,960
"Oh my dear..."

409
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:11,320
"Oh my dear..."

410
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,720
"Hey my love..."

411
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,240
"Don't you push me away"

412
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,200
"Hey my love, don't push me away"

413
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:27,040
"I just can't live without you"

414
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:34,560
"Oh my dear, all I wish
for is a world of my own"

415
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:42,680
"And in that world of
mine all I need is you"

416
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:11,440
"Every poet has a love that inspires.
Similarly you are mine"

417
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:15,120
"They way you look at me is like
the sun shine falling on the moon"

418
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:19,080
"Like every God has fallen
in love with a Goddess..."

419
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,560
"Similarly I have fallen in
love with you, my Goddess"

420
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:27,040
"I was walking all alone and you
came along to hold my hands"

421
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,160
"Now my life is all
about you and only you"

422
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:34,200
"Hey my love, don't push me away"

423
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:38,040
"I just can't live without you"

424
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,840
"Hey my love, don't push me away"

425
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:45,680
"I just can't live without you"

426
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:53,360
"Oh my dear, all I wish
for is a world of my own"

427
00:29:53,480 --> 00:30:01,720
"And in that world of
mine all I need is you"

428
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:24,120
"In my heart, I have etched your portrait"

429
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:31,720
"In my heart, I have etched your portrait"

430
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:35,360
"I am ready to tie the knot"

431
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,240
"You are my responsibility
hereafter, oh my love"

432
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:43,120
"So, I am ready to tie the knot"

433
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,960
"You are my responsibility
hereafter, oh my love"

434
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:50,880
"Whether you are around or not..."

435
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:54,600
"I love you, my love"

436
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:58,720
"Even if you forget me and go far away..."

437
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:02,320
"I will love you, oh my love"

438
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:06,480
"Hey my love, don't push me away"

439
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:10,000
"I just can't live without you"

440
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:14,160
"Hey my love, don't push me away"

441
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,720
"I just can't live without you"

442
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:25,640
"Oh my dear, all I wish
for is a world of my own"

443
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:33,400
"And in that world of
mine all I need is you"

444
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,360
"Oh my dear..."

445
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:40,920
"Oh my dear..."

446
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,320
"Oh my dear..."

447
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:49,920
"Oh my dear..."

448
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,600
Greetings brother!

449
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,080
Welcome. How are you Maruthumuthu?

450
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,480
- Sir, an important information
- What is it?

451
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:08,920
You friend, Deepak Mehta, has
escaped to abroad last night

452
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,080
What are you blabbing?
Why would he escape?

453
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,480
Using the government order you gave him,
he borrowed a 40 billion rupees loan

454
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,680
It seems he ran away
with that loaned amount

455
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,320
Please confirm it twice
before judging him

456
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,760
Sir, it's a confirmed information

457
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,520
Any problem?

458
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,520
Nothing

459
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,800
Thanks for informing me, commissioner sir.
I'll take care of it

460
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,240
We shall discuss it
once this meeting is over

461
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,200
Ok, sir

462
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,360
- Sengunram, call up Deepak
- Ok, sir

463
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,360
Dear sister...

464
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:34,520
- What a grand arrangement
- Indeed!

465
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,400
Let this vigour and strength be in
tact until the election is here

466
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,000
I found it

467
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,680
- Sir, the CM is here
- Is it?

468
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,320
- Take care of things over here
- Ok

469
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,520
Make it fast. Our leader is here

470
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:55,360
Long live our leader! Long live Gupta ji!

471
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:13,640
Sir...

472
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,880
Deepak sir's mobile is switched off

473
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,640
- Keep trying to reach him. Don't stop
- Ok, sir

474
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,800
Greetings to all my dear bloods here

475
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,760
Usually politics is...

476
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,400
known for making money using power

477
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:40,000
Then use the same money to buy off
people to again grab the power

478
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:42,960
Breaking that myth and uprooting
the greed of money...

479
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
and dedicated my life for servicing

480
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,880
That's the best work of my life

481
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,800
If I step away from the
power in the future...

482
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:55,440
then I'll be only in a position to move to a
rented house from the government provided one

483
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:59,720
I welcome my son, Saravana
to follow my path

484
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:06,040
I welcome him, with all your support, to
the party and to undertake the government

485
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,200
Long live RKS! Long Live RKS!

486
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,280
Congrats dear sister!

487
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,560
All the best

488
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,240
Greetings to one and all

489
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,160
I consider the party and
all my party men above me

490
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:36,200
Today I've become the leader because of
the lessons on hard work my father taught me

491
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,800
Until my last breath...

492
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:44,520
I promise that I'll stay true
to this post and position!

493
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,680
Meera!

494
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,880
This alliance is not for
political benefits!

495
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,960
This is an alliance to bring a
positive change for the downtrodden!

496
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,560
Please!

497
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,440
Meera, Subash is calling you

498
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,000
Check your message

499
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:09,920
- Dear...
- Yes dad?

500
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,520
Awesome speech by your brother

501
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,200
What happened?

502
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,320
I forgot my phone in the car.
Let me go, get it

503
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,040
I'm not just the leader
but the people's servant

504
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,520
Make it fast!

505
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:26,600
Our sir has already started his speech!
He is just going to blow everyone's mind

506
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,560
Ma'am why are you here?

507
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,480
- I forgot my phone in the car
- Wait, I'll go get it

508
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:33,240
Give me the keys. I know you all are
eager to his my brother-in-law's speech

509
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:33,960
Ok ma'am

510
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,240
- Come on, guys. Let's go
- People just won't let me romance in peace!

511
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,800
We'll ensure justice is served and
everyone person's rights are respected

512
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,480
Where's Meera?

513
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,680
Went to the parking lot

514
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,080
- Where are you off to?
- Make a call

515
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,600
Sorry madam

516
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,040
Can't even mind his step!

517
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,320
Hey!

518
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,160
Why so late?

519
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,920
Police everywhere! Had
to sneak in carefully

520
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,480
Fine, give me the phone

521
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,640
Who's calling to this number?

522
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,880
Sorry, man! On my way I dashed a woman

523
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,560
- I think our phones got exchanged
- How can be so cool about it?

524
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,840
It has the number to the phone
that will blast the bomb on the stage

525
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,560
We cannot blast the bomb without that phone!
Go, get it before he completes his speech!

526
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,920
TN P 997...

527
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,320
Kumar, this is that woman!

528
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,640
You! Give me my phone!

529
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,560
Dude, the police is here

530
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,520
What are you guys doing here?

531
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,080
We are here for the catering service

532
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,800
- Don't wait here! Move!
- Ok, sir

533
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,680
Make it fast! Move!

534
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,840
At once, sir

535
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,080
What happened? Where did she go?

536
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,320
She kicked me down and ran away!

537
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,160
You go this side
and look for her!

538
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,480
What is it? What happened?

539
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,720
What are you trying to say?

540
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:08,040
I now request Mr. Gupta
ji to address the people

541
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,720
Greeting, Tamizh Nadu

542
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,880
Honorable Shri. KRK...

543
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,320
- Where did she go?
- I don't know

544
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,040
Tell me

545
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,880
Where are you? Dad's asking about you.
Come here at once

546
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,200
Is Meera there?

547
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:49,960
Hello

548
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:50,960
Hel...

549
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:36,520
Madam, she has our phone.
Don't let her escape!

550
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,400
During our tenure in the government, every
state will be given equal importance

551
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:58,120
We will also act on the
Cauvery issue immediately

552
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:03,960
Like RKS ji said, we shall also look
into the medical entrance exam issue

553
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,400
Deepak!

554
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,720
Hello. Saravana!

555
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:17,440
Where are you?

556
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,720
Forget about me. You better
get away from the dias!

557
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,720
There are rumours about
you making rounds here!

558
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,600
We'll deal that later. You
first leave from there!

559
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:24,880
What do you mean?

560
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:30,120
And with your help, we
shall achieve all this

561
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,720
It's for your good! You
better leave that place! Now!

562
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,240
Subash! Check what happened to Mr. Gupta!

563
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:33,640
He trusted us and came here.
Ensure nothing happens to him

564
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:36,640
It's our duty to ensure his safety!
Please, check on him!

565
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,040
Gupta ji!

566
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,040
Gupta ji!

567
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,600
Dear brother!

568
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:52,760
Gupta ji!

569
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:55,600
Gupta ji!

570
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:04,240
Sources say that the bomb blast that took
place wasn't carried out by terrorists...

571
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,640
and in fact some politicians
are said to be behind it

572
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,760
Please tell us! What's
our minister's condition?

573
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,560
Hello...Hello,
yes it's confirmed

574
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,680
I just got the report. He died on the spot

575
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:15,720
No! It was a bomb made up of
dangerous chemical combinations

576
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,080
It was secretly fixed inside the
AC and the blasted using a remote

577
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,520
Ok, I'll do it

578
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,560
Entire country is in chaos!

579
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:26,240
A high command order has been
passed to shift the body to Delhi

580
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,360
- Our leader...
- Shut up!

581
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,600
- That too in our state, he was...
- I said, shut up!

582
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:32,520
Go to the airport and arrange
a private jet at once!

583
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,200
Understand? Please! Take him out!

584
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:37,000
Ensure all the arrangements are
done in the party office at Delhi

585
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,840
- Come on, brother. Let's go out
- But why? What's our fault?

586
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,920
- Sir, it's better you leave
- What happened?

587
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:44,960
The situation is just not good. Just leave.
I'll talk to you later! Please!

588
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Dude, what's happening?

589
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,760
Subash, things have gone awry

590
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,760
I just want to ensure your safety

591
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:51,600
Please leave!

592
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:54,120
Is my safety more important
than the issue going on here?

593
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,680
Tell me, what happened to my party people?

594
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:57,280
Only 10 people died in bomb blast

595
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:59,720
But more than 15 have
died in the stampede!

596
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,360
- Where are all those people?
- Same hospital, different block

597
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,360
- Sir, we'll handle it
- Get lost!

598
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,760
- Sir!
- Dear brother!

599
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:09,120
Yes, sister-in-law?

600
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:10,760
Meera isn't home yet

601
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,960
Her phone is out of reach. Is she with you?

602
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:14,080
No, she isn't with me

603
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:17,280
She might have lost her way
amidst that crowd. I shall wait

604
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:24,160
The identities of the deceased are still unknown.
I've ordered the officers to identify it

605
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:27,160
- Look at this! Look what happened!
- Please! Move! Move!

606
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,280
Dear brother...

607
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,480
How did this happen? Oh my God!

608
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:13,840
How did this happen?

609
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,760
They found her lying
dead in the backstage

610
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:18,960
She had went to the parking lot to get
her phone but got killed in the stampede

611
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:22,120
She died from choking and suffocation
according to the autopsy report

612
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:30,160
To hell with your party and it's flag!

613
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:32,000
Die!

614
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:37,200
KRK down! Down!
RKS party down! Down!

615
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:44,800
What's going on, dear?

616
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:45,680
I have no idea, dad

617
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:48,520
We've requested two more battalion forces
to bring the situation under control

618
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,960
Until then you and your family
stay in one room for your safety

619
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,520
First, tell us what's going on?

620
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:55,280
No one has the guts to tell it to your face

621
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:56,200
Watch it for yourself

622
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:01,280
Riots everywhere in Tamizh Nadu following
Mr. Gupta's death in the bomb blast

623
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:08,640
Deputy CM, Sarvanan could be the mind
behind this according to sources

624
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,040
Could be? It's the fact!

625
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:11,840
Deepak Mehta and Saravana
are thick friends

626
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:15,560
They approved Deepak Mehta a loan of 40 billion
and in return he carried out the bomb blast

627
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:17,520
If Deepak hadn't absconded to abroad...

628
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:19,800
they would've closed the case saying
it is the plot by our enemies

629
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:22,440
How would killing the
leader benefit deputy CM?

630
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:26,320
Sympathy votes. His dad just made
him the leader of the party...

631
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:30,400
and this is Saravana's trick
to win his first election!

632
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:33,880
In fact when the bomb blast took place,
Saravnan got a call and stepped away

633
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:37,840
I got the information that call was
from the absconding Deepak Mehta

634
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:40,200
The case must be handled
to CBI to bring the truth

635
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:41,520
I'm innocent

636
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:42,520
I have proof

637
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,480
Forget about me. You better
get away from the dias!

638
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:46,040
There are rumours about
you making rounds here!

639
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:48,160
We'll deal that later. You
first leave from there!

640
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:49,920
Sengunram...

641
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,960
arrange a press meet
at our home, at once!

642
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,360
Dear, our house bride to be
is lying dead down there...

643
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,240
is the press meet necessary at this point?

644
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:58,720
Never put hold on
putting out the fire!

645
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,040
Yes, sir. I'm at the CM's house

646
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:06,520
I'll collect the news and reach

647
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:10,320
Subash...

648
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:13,840
our brother had ordered for the press meet.
He went into his room...

649
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:18,600
The press is here but he locked himself
in the room and isn't answering the door

650
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:19,960
I'm worried!

651
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:25,200
- Dear, please open the door
- Sir, please open the door

652
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:26,520
- Dear, what are you doing in there?
- Sir, please open

653
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:27,200
Move!

654
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:28,000
What happened?

655
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:28,920
He is not opening the door

656
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,920
- Dear brother! Brother!
- Dear, please!

657
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:40,560
Dear brother!

658
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:42,000
Oh dear brother!

659
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:56,640
A little while ago, deputy
CM Saravanan committed

660
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:58,440
suicide by hanging
himself in his house

661
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:01,360
It is doubted that Mr.Saravanan
has a hand in Gupta ji's murder

662
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:08,520
In this situation, Saravanan's
death confirms his involvement

663
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:12,560
The crowd surrounding the chief minister's
house is getting uncontrollable

664
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:20,320
Following his, all the MSK party offices all
over Tamizh Nadu is slowly closing down

665
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:23,720
Daddy!

666
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:27,200
As my elder son, you must be carrying
out my final rites after my death...

667
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:30,720
but look at my plight that I now
have to carry out your final rites

668
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:37,360
Subash, the mob is furious at
your family and going crazy

669
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,000
Begin the proceedings

670
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:40,800
A small request

671
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:42,960
Use the back gate and not the front one

672
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:45,560
Bharathwaj! What do you mean by that?

673
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:47,920
All there is a riot going
outside your house

674
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:49,000
Hence, sir...

675
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:52,320
Is my son a thief, a
terrorist or an orphan?

676
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,840
- Why must we use the back gate?
- Sir, please understand

677
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:59,560
1000s are waiting outside with weapons, thinking
your son was also involved in the blast

678
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:02,280
The situation is not our favor.
Too much of hatred out there

679
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:04,560
To hell with it! I have faced
worse in my experience!

680
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:07,080
Kumaresa, call up the
capital, Delhi! Now!

681
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:46,080
The one who is suppose
is lead is gone forever!

682
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:49,440
The one suppose to run the government
is been taken away like an orphan!

683
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:04,800
See you dear, brother-in-law

684
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:10,960
Subash, our brother's wife hasn't
ate anything since two days

685
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,520
She isn't talking to anybody

686
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:14,000
I'm worried

687
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:15,440
Please, go check on her

688
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:30,320
My husband is honest and genuine

689
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:41,000
He is an innocent who never thinks
ill of or evil towards anyone

690
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:44,560
But did you notice how everyone
is being talking so cruel about him?

691
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:48,040
When I hear all this...

692
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:50,720
is pushing me to end my life

693
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:52,240
Please dear, sister-in-law

694
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:57,600
Whoever killed me dad, we must
not spare their life uncle

695
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:00,200
They must shed tears like the
way we are shedding now!

696
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:05,320
- Tell me
- Subash...

697
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:09,200
Remember the vehicle number Meera scribbled
in her hand before she was killed?

698
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:12,600
We found it and also found
where it was bought

699
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:13,880
Come here, at once

700
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:19,000
You must punish them

701
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:28,080
Two days ago, a woman and two men
came here and bought the van

702
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,680
All the documents they submitted is bogus

703
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,720
None of the CCTV works in this shop

704
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:34,760
But we have a small footage
from the CCTV at the exit

705
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,560
But we aren't able to
trace anyone using that

706
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:37,920
Sir, please pause it

707
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:39,680
Rewind a little bit

708
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:41,240
Stop!

709
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:42,880
Zoom in

710
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:50,720
This tattoo seems familiar to me

711
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:55,280
Bharath...

712
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,520
this lady was at my home
when my brother died!

713
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:58,280
Who could she be?

714
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:01,000
On that day, apart from your
relatives and the party people...

715
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:04,320
the only strangers at your home were
the journalists from the press media

716
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:09,560
Every one from press media has signed
the register while security check

717
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:11,000
Look!

718
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,080
Look carefully! That's her

719
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:14,560
She has entered the house...

720
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:18,760
but she is missing from the spot where other
journalists were waiting for my brother

721
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:22,840
All the press people dispersed after
the news of my brother's death

722
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:29,640
She pops out of the blue and
joins the exiting press people

723
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,200
She came in with everyone

724
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:33,560
And left along with them

725
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:35,760
She went missing for
15 minutes in between

726
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:37,320
Exactly when my brother died

727
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:38,040
Look!

728
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:40,400
Gupta ji, Meera and
my elder brother...

729
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:42,960
the only common factor in
these three deaths is her!

730
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:47,000
She came in posing as the photographer
along with Kalai Murasu reporter Malathi

731
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:49,920
Catch hold of Malathi
and we can get to her!

732
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:51,200
Sir!

733
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:53,480
We inquired at the
Kalai Murasu office...

734
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:55,720
reporter Malathi, whom you talk of,
hasn't turned up to office since two days

735
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:56,960
Is it? Why?

736
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:57,920
No idea, sir

737
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:03,640
She left saying that she'll submit the report
about your brother's death and be back

738
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:05,360
But she only
returned as a corpse

739
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:09,280
She was on her scooter and a truck ran her
over. They delivered her to us like a package

740
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:12,280
Did I raise her with so much
love, only to lose her?

741
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:15,960
Does your daughter have any friend
with a tattoo on their neck?

742
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:17,880
The girl with tattoo on her neck?

743
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:20,400
She met her only two days ago.
Very kind girl

744
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:24,760
The day your brother died, she
accompanied my daughter as photographer

745
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,600
But she didn't turn up
after my daughter died

746
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:29,720
Sir, can I get your daughter's
diary or cell phone

747
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:32,200
Malathi didn't have the
habit of writing diary

748
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:35,920
The police returned it to us and told
us that it broke during the accident

749
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:39,080
Our last hope in this case...

750
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:40,160
is this phone

751
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:50,960
She's too clever

752
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:52,840
She has formatted the phone already

753
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:54,320
There is no information in it

754
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:55,360
I guessed it

755
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:58,240
There must be back up in Google drive. Try
retrieving the data using the email id

756
00:53:58,280 --> 00:53:59,360
Ok

757
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:07,200
Yes! We have back
up of all the files

758
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:08,280
Copy that

759
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:15,480
What?

760
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:21,400
Crap!

761
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:24,040
She is always a step ahead of us

762
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:25,880
She is hacking the data from a
different location and deleting it

763
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:28,440
The last saved files are
the ones deleted first

764
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:30,360
We cannot find her now

765
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:31,320
We can!

766
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:33,440
Trace the user's location
who deleted this data

767
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:34,280
Sure!

768
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:40,360
Mexico! She is there!

769
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:42,040
Iran!

770
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:44,840
Indonesia!

771
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:46,840
London!

772
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:48,520
Sri Lanka!

773
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:50,080
It's showing five
different locations

774
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,040
She is brilliant!

775
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:53,480
She is using proxy
server to confuse us

776
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:56,000
Out of these five location
only one is her true location

777
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:58,080
But we can't find
out which one is it

778
00:54:58,120 --> 00:54:58,880
London!

779
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:02,320
But how?

780
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,600
In the security CCTV footage,
while she was signing the register...

781
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:06,080
I noted her mobile phone

782
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:09,280
It had two time zones. The difference
between the one and the IST was 4.5 hours

783
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:10,680
Out of these five locations...

784
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:13,760
the only time zone with a difference
of 4.5 hours is London

785
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,240
If we check the list of
passengers who flew to...

786
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:18,280
London on the same day
as my brother died...

787
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:19,520
and we'll find her

788
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:22,720
Sir, she has travelled to London in
British Airways on the date you mentioned

789
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:24,720
All the details are here in this file

790
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:26,440
Her name is Kaira

791
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:27,720
She is a professional killer

792
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:29,600
Most wanted criminal by the Interpol

793
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:31,960
As far as we know, she
is based out of London

794
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,240
But no one knows about her
target and her whereabouts

795
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:38,760
I'll go in search of her

796
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,960
The only evidence we
have to reach her...

797
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,040
is the fake passport that she used

798
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:44,840
I'm sure the address in it is also fake

799
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:46,240
How will you trace with that?

800
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:49,080
I have no option

801
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:52,880
The one getting chased has many directions
to run but the one chasing has only one!

802
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:10,160
"Oh my Superhero, come to me"

803
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:14,320
"Hey Superhero!"

804
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:29,320
"I leave no job incomplete! I finish
what I start! I am like the..."

805
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:29,880
"Fire! Fire!"

806
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:33,560
"I'm invincible! I'm unstoppable!
I breathe..."

807
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:34,400
"Fire! Fire!"

808
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:38,720
"You can near me but never catch me!
I'm the most dangerous venom"

809
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:43,560
"I need no weapon to kill you!
Blink and you're dead now!"

810
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:54,040
"Killer! Killer! I got
killer eyes like the moon"

811
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,520
"My looks are drug and
my breathe; fire!"

812
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:58,480
"Killer! Killer! I got
killer eyes like the moon"

813
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:00,760
"My looks are drug and
my breathe; fire!"

814
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:03,080
"Fire! Fire!"

815
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:05,400
"Fire! Fire!"

816
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:07,720
"Fire! Fire!"

817
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:09,440
"Fire! Fire!"

818
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:11,320
"Hey Superhero!"

819
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:13,720
"Hey Superhero!"

820
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:15,840
"Hey fighter!"

821
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:18,200
"You are my target"

822
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:20,320
"She's a new kind of drug
that will never wear off"

823
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:22,520
"Time to break the
hurdles and step out"

824
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:24,760
"Don't you fall for
her beautiful smile"

825
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:27,160
"Because she's fire and
you'll be burnt to ashes"

826
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:29,160
"Fire! Fire! Don't mess with the tiger"

827
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:31,320
"Finger on the trigger!
Trigger! Trigger!"

828
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:33,840
"My Gucci bag got that AK47"

829
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:35,960
"I'll point it on your forehead and..."

830
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:55,560
"Killer! Killer! I got
killer eyes like the moon"

831
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:57,880
"My looks are drug and
my breathe; fire!"

832
00:57:57,920 --> 00:57:59,840
"Killer! Killer! I got
killer eyes like the moon"

833
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:02,280
"My looks are drug and
my breathe; fire!"

834
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:05,640
"I'm the devil calling
you out, to destroy you"

835
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:06,840
"So come out!"

836
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:10,040
"I'm the beauty that'll
make you fall for my smile"

837
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:10,800
"So come out!"

838
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:12,880
"Hey Superhero!"

839
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:15,040
"Hey Superhero!"

840
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:17,120
"Hey fighter!"

841
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:20,000
"You are my target"

842
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:30,520
"Hey Superhero!"

843
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:32,720
"Hey Superhero!"

844
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:34,880
"Hey fighter!"

845
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:37,480
"You are my target"

846
00:58:58,720 --> 00:58:59,760
Go!

847
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:37,000
You have right at your destination

848
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:13,480
Who erected a pole at my doorstep?

849
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:14,800
Oh! It's a human

850
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:15,760
Yes?

851
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:16,680
What do you want?

852
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:18,240
Well, Kaira?

853
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,280
1812, 79, Crown street

854
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:22,800
- Correct
- You got the address is correct

855
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:24,480
But the girl you're looking
for isn't here. Now, leave

856
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:25,280
Are you a Tamizhan?

857
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:27,520
Why? Do I look like Brad Pitt?

858
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:29,600
I'm a hardcore Chennaite from
the hardcore area, Pulianthope!

859
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:30,400
What's the matter?

860
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:31,280
Well...

861
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:34,280
- This is the address I was given
- Don't ogle at her. That's a granny

862
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:35,680
Grandpa, close the door!

863
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:38,880
Please help me find that girl

864
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:40,960
I swear I don't the girl you're looking for

865
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,760
But four persons came in
search of her before you

866
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:44,880
Then I hear that all four died
under mysterious circumstances

867
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:46,520
You look very innocent...

868
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:48,080
So run for your life and head back home

869
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:51,040
- You can reach just by taking two steps
- Brother, you say you're a Tamizhan...

870
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:52,800
Won't you help a fellow Tamizhan?

871
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:54,920
Doesn't mean I'll quit my current
job and join you in searching her

872
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:56,600
I'll buy you a coffee
on your way back...

873
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:57,720
drink it, pay the
bill and go home!

874
01:00:57,760 --> 01:00:59,560
Don't walk in to my bedroom.
Come on!

875
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:03,960
- Let me introduce myself. I'm Subash
- I know

876
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:06,240
You're ranked as a Colonel
officer in Indian army

877
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:08,640
2013 batch, Ooty regiment

878
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:10,920
Your phone number is 9444131157

879
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:12,560
You've a bank account in
Canara bank, Dehradun

880
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:14,760
Your native is Pazhani and
your father is Tamizh Nadu CM

881
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:16,360
Enough or you want more details?

882
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:17,480
How did you find it?

883
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:19,800
Digging out information about
strangers; that's my profession

884
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:21,520
I'm a professional hacker

885
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:23,600
- Unbelievable
- Why?

886
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,200
Don't I look like an hacker?

887
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:26,640
You look like a real estate broker!

888
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:29,200
This sarcasm is what stops me
from helping fellow Tamizhans

889
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:31,920
The doorbell that you
rang at my doorstep...

890
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:33,200
is a finger print scanner

891
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:36,080
I collected all your details
using your fingerprint

892
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:37,480
Do you get it now?

893
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:41,920
When you're so skilled, why can't you help
me find the whereabouts of that girl?

894
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:43,560
It's not as easy as it sounds!

895
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:47,240
In order to find any detail in
net, you need some information

896
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:48,080
Got it?

897
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:50,800
Next flight to India is at 6 'O clock.
Hope you're leaving

898
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:51,800
What?

899
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:54,920
The old couple living
right opposite to you

900
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,000
They are my house owner

901
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:57,200
What's the matter?

902
01:01:57,560 --> 01:01:58,760
I need their phone number

903
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:00,200
What do they have go to do this?

904
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:03,400
When I rang your doorbell, they opened
their door before you opened yours

905
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:06,440
Poor elder citizens. If they were
Indians they'd be watching TV serial

906
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:09,280
They being from here they might
have been eager for some gossip

907
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:12,560
I saw the same exact tattoo in their
home which that girl had in her neck

908
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:18,760
Those who died in pursuit of Kaira...

909
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:20,800
I guess that couple must have
some link to their deaths

910
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:21,560
What should I do?

911
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:23,280
Get me the details of
their incoming calls...

912
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:24,840
and outgoing calls made
in last half an hour

913
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:25,880
It's a walk in the park

914
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:27,040
But it'll cost you a bit

915
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:28,080
Don't give me that look!

916
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:29,640
Pay me and I shall open my laptop

917
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:30,840
Or else, forget it

918
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:32,480
I'll pay you.
Do it

919
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:41,440
Mr. Military, only one outgoing
call made in last half an hour

920
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:43,080
I have messaged you the number

921
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:46,880
A message that Rs. 50,000 has been
withdrawn from my account. Who did it?

922
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:48,360
- That's none other than me
- You did it?

923
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:50,760
Is only 'Action King' Arjun
allowed to hack your account?

924
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:52,560
I just took my fee in advance

925
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:54,280
I have sent you her number.

926
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:02,560
Dude! I'm getting a
call from her number

927
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:05,360
Hello

928
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:12,240
Hand the phone to the guy next to you

929
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:13,720
Why won't you talk to me?

930
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:15,600
Stupid! Just give it to him

931
01:03:15,640 --> 01:03:17,640
Brainless! Loser! Do what I say

932
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:19,560
She has something to tell you.
Here, talk

933
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:25,600
- Hello Kaira
- What's up?

934
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:28,680
Are you here in London, to avenge
the death of your family members?

935
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:32,120
With all your connections in
politics and with police...

936
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:35,240
I still managed to kill your family members
with ease and that too in your city

937
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:36,560
This is my hood!

938
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:38,640
Just imagine how easy it is
for me to finish you off

939
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:40,360
Quit showing off your
heroism and go back!

940
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:41,400
Where is Deepak Mehta?

941
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:43,560
Deepak might have betrayed you

942
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:45,440
But I won't betray him

943
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:47,080
If I can find your number...

944
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:49,600
- Then don't you think I can find you?
- You mean call tracking?

945
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:50,400
Idiot!

946
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:53,320
How will you trace me if you I
break this SIM and throw it away

947
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:57,400
Even if you search nook and corner
of London for the next 10 years...

948
01:03:57,680 --> 01:03:58,960
you won't be able to catch me

949
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:01,640
You may fear me and throw
away the SIM to escape

950
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:02,920
But I've no fear

951
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:05,320
"9444131157"

952
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:06,640
That's my number

953
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:08,600
I'll be waiting for
you at the Trafalgar Square,

954
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:10,160
tomorrow morning.
I'll be in a red tee

955
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:12,400
I have only my will
power and nothing else

956
01:04:12,680 --> 01:04:14,640
You show off that this is your hood...

957
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:16,280
Then I dare you to come

958
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:17,880
We'll see

959
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:20,880
What did she tell you?

960
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:23,360
She said she'll kill anyone and
everyone who is on my team

961
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:25,240
Hey! I'm the only one
here, in your team

962
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:27,680
She wants to kill me for
hacking a granny's phone?

963
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:31,280
I don't care how but it's
your duty to safe guard me!

964
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:32,880
- There is only one way I can do that
- What's that?

965
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:35,680
- I'll think of an idea and tell tomorrow
- So you're here without any idea?

966
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:37,520
There's no one, who will save
me if I get bashed up in India!

967
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:39,680
Here you are, pushing me
into trouble here in London!

968
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:52,360
Here, take it

969
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:53,800
Here you go. You! Here

970
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:54,720
Take it

971
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:56,640
Look, I remember all your faces

972
01:04:56,680 --> 01:04:58,040
Wear it and roam around in this very place.

973
01:04:58,120 --> 01:05:00,200
If you leave,
I'll find you and bash you up!

974
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:01,160
Here, take it!

975
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:01,760
Take it!

976
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:03,520
I said 'Only for men' yet
why are you snatching it?

977
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:04,120
Get lost!

978
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:05,120
Excuse me Subash!

979
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:06,720
I distributed all the tee shirts

980
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:10,320
I thought only our people are desperate
for freebies but these guys are worse!

981
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:11,720
They are swarming
in for freebie!

982
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:13,120
Forget them.

983
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:16,800
Take out the two tee shirts that
you've flicked and distribute them too!

984
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:18,880
How did he find out?

985
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:20,960
He is so tall that he can
see me from anywhere!

986
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,440
Here are the ones I flicked.
What should I do with them?

987
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:26,360
- Distribute them and wait. I'll tell you
- Here! Take it and get lost!

988
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:33,880
Red tee shirt

989
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:50,760
Chief, there are many here in red tee
but no signs of him

990
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:52,720
Fool!

991
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,040
He must be there

992
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:56,920
Put all your men in a conference
call, I'll track him

993
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,480
Then I'll connect with you and guide you

994
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:00,920
Yes, chief! Move it! Move it!

995
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:02,000
Ok! Copied!

996
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:08,280
Jack...

997
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:09,000
Hello

998
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:11,520
- As expected, she didn't turn up
- And so what should I do?

999
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:14,120
There are 100s of them
using cell phones here

1000
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:16,360
Can you find who all are
in conference call here?

1001
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:18,240
Listen! My name is Jack!

1002
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:20,160
I'm an expert in cracking
the toughest of servers...

1003
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:21,760
and that earned me the
nick name Crackjack!

1004
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:23,400
So, don't you doubt my skills!

1005
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:25,440
Watch me crack this for
you in two minutes!

1006
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:55,520
To your right

1007
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:56,880
200 metres

1008
01:06:57,120 --> 01:06:57,760
Ok!

1009
01:06:57,800 --> 01:06:58,880
Guys, right!

1010
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:07,480
Hello, Subash...

1011
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:09,560
There are four conference
call active in this locality

1012
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:11,400
One of those is from the
same service provider...

1013
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:13,000
and ten of them are attending
it from the same spot

1014
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:14,680
- Looks like some company call
- Next

1015
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:18,800
Dude, a girl is talking to
three men at the same time

1016
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:19,800
Where is she?

1017
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:21,680
Right next to me but
she's of no use to you

1018
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:22,960
- She might be of some use to me
- How?

1019
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:25,120
Because she available
for all not just one

1020
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:28,760
Do you have any sense?
Not the time!

1021
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:30,640
Don't always think
only about yourself

1022
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:31,760
Spare a thought for me too

1023
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:33,360
You're issue is that you're
not able to find one girl

1024
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:35,920
Where as my issue is that I'm
not even able to find one girl

1025
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:39,440
You're nearing him

1026
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:44,520
To your right

1027
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:46,080
- Just 70 metres
- Got it!

1028
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:58,120
What's the status?

1029
01:07:58,240 --> 01:07:59,680
Hold on for a second

1030
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:01,640
Two guys are talking
very seriously on a call

1031
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:02,960
The numbers too
seem to be familiar

1032
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:04,880
You! Whom are you talking to?

1033
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:06,840
You! I'm going to slap you now!

1034
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:08,880
- Stop kidding!
- I'm sorry

1035
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:10,720
You're nearing him

1036
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:11,600
40 metres

1037
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:15,080
A girls just caught my attention and I
lost track. Why are you getting furious?

1038
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:17,400
Look, six of them are in a conference call

1039
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:20,040
Five of them are here but one
of them is a little away

1040
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:22,200
That's her!
Find out her location

1041
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:24,200
Watch me! I'll get you
that in two minutes

1042
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:26,680
Just 20 metres. Go straight

1043
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:33,680
What happened?

1044
01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:35,160
10 seconds. You're nearing her

1045
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:36,440
How long is it going to take?

1046
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:38,560
You can shout at me and I'll
speed up but Google won't!

1047
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:39,680
Hold on for two more seconds

1048
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:41,200
Yes! I found it!

1049
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:47,080
200 metres from
here, on the right

1050
01:08:47,160 --> 01:08:48,160
In Victoria hall

1051
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:50,360
- She is there. Got it?
- Thanks Jack

1052
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:51,640
Where is he headed?

1053
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:52,760
Hey Subash!

1054
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:56,760
Uh-oh! He left his phone here but why?

1055
01:08:57,200 --> 01:08:58,520
Chief, where is he?

1056
01:08:58,560 --> 01:08:59,440
3 metres

1057
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:00,760
To your left

1058
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:06,760
Target found

1059
01:09:14,760 --> 01:09:15,600
Yes, what's up?

1060
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:17,200
Why are you hacking this number?

1061
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:19,160
Rascal! That's my profession

1062
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:20,240
Guys! Bash him

1063
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:21,720
Why are you guys hitting me?

1064
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:44,480
- Not my face, please! I'm still single
- Yes, chief?

1065
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:46,920
Idiots! You found the wrong guy

1066
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:47,960
He is here

1067
01:09:49,320 --> 01:09:50,360
Make it fast!

1068
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:51,600
Guys, let's go!

1069
01:09:56,680 --> 01:09:59,720
You guys just turned a
hacker into a joker!

1070
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:01,520
Mr. Subash...

1071
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:03,280
well done!

1072
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:07,280
That was an awesome way to thank me for
being a help to you for past two days!

1073
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:16,840
Chief, catch!

1074
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:20,040
He cannot save you

1075
01:17:20,160 --> 01:17:21,680
So don't try to save him

1076
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:22,640
Now, tell me

1077
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:23,520
Where is Deepak?

1078
01:17:23,560 --> 01:17:26,200
Torture me as much you
want but I won't tell

1079
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:28,240
- I have some ethics
- Ethics?

1080
01:17:28,280 --> 01:17:30,880
You're a contracted killer! What
ethics are you speaking about?

1081
01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:32,200
You...

1082
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:38,880
You've a message from your bank

1083
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:41,440
Without realizing that you'll
be dead in sometime...

1084
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:44,440
someone has transferred you
0.5 million USD to kill a target

1085
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:47,520
That target is none other than you!

1086
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:50,040
The have a very huge network

1087
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:53,720
If not me they will still finish
you off using somebody else

1088
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:56,320
Go back! That's your only chance to live

1089
01:17:56,360 --> 01:17:58,080
I will definitely go...

1090
01:17:58,120 --> 01:17:59,440
but in pursuit of Deepak

1091
01:18:00,200 --> 01:18:03,200
How'd you reach him without
me telling you his location?

1092
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:04,440
You don't have to tell me

1093
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:05,680
Your phone already did!

1094
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:40,160
Who is it?
Who are you?

1095
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:52,680
Subash! Help me!

1096
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:55,320
Subash! Save me!

1097
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:56,800
Save your ethics

1098
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:04,080
I'll give you his location!
Please, save me!

1099
01:19:24,440 --> 01:19:26,040
Stomp her to death

1100
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:29,200
Only then they'll believe
that she died in the stampede

1101
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:06,160
What do I want?

1102
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:08,200
One plate Baklava and two
plates of cat Biriyani

1103
01:20:08,240 --> 01:20:10,880
Keep it ready. I just have to get rid
of someone. I'll do it and be back

1104
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:12,520
- Ok?
- What's up dear brother-in-law?

1105
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:14,720
- You didn't have to come
- I'm not here to receive you

1106
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:16,200
- I'm here to send you back
- What do you mean?

1107
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:19,200
Already this issue took Meera and
your elder brother away from us

1108
01:20:19,240 --> 01:20:21,720
And here you are to take revenge. What
if something happens to you? Leave!

1109
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:23,440
- Listen to me...
- Subash

1110
01:20:25,240 --> 01:20:27,280
- Hi Subash
- What is she doing here?

1111
01:20:27,320 --> 01:20:31,200
She refused a promotion, requested a foreign
affairs posting and moved to Turkey

1112
01:20:31,240 --> 01:20:32,320
Wonder why she did that

1113
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:33,160
But I know

1114
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:34,600
Come on, nothing of that sort

1115
01:20:34,640 --> 01:20:36,440
I needed a break

1116
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:37,800
He was about to say something

1117
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:39,080
Well, dear brother-in-law...

1118
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:41,480
When people have a heart break
they move away for a break...

1119
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:45,200
so that their heart break heals, they get ready
for next heart break and thus the break...

1120
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:47,680
- Actually what's your plan
- I'll tell you

1121
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:49,080
Is he here to romance or relax?

1122
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:50,880
Dear brother-in-law!

1123
01:20:56,240 --> 01:20:59,360
Diya, the account from which Kaira
received the money for murdering me...

1124
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:01,280
is from a bank here in Istanbul

1125
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:03,120
- Guess, whose account is that
- Whose?

1126
01:21:03,160 --> 01:21:04,600
- Deepak Mehta's account
- What?

1127
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:05,560
Yeah

1128
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:08,360
We must find his address
using that account number

1129
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:11,280
In Turkey, even if you have one's
address still it'd be hard to find them

1130
01:21:11,320 --> 01:21:13,680
And you think you guys can find
him using his account details?

1131
01:21:13,720 --> 01:21:14,680
No chance!

1132
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:17,200
You better have a leisure
tour and go back home

1133
01:21:17,240 --> 01:21:19,080
One more time you say
something negative...

1134
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:19,960
Uh-oh!

1135
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:21,400
Subash...

1136
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:23,920
things will be easy if we
take our government's help

1137
01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:26,160
In this situation, I can't trust anybody

1138
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:29,040
I tried ing the bank data
to get his account details

1139
01:21:29,560 --> 01:21:30,280
But I couldn't

1140
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:32,520
They've installed very strong
firewalls in their system

1141
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:34,640
Password is dynamic which
keeps changing at intervals

1142
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:35,960
Very tight security system

1143
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,160
I couldn't break them

1144
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:38,280
Awesome!

1145
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:42,760
I'm so proud that I have an account
in such a highly secured bank

1146
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:43,720
Have some coffee

1147
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:46,880
Haven't I warned you from
saying anything negative?

1148
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:48,240
Did I sound negative now?

1149
01:21:48,280 --> 01:21:50,040
Wasn't I speaking
positive about the bank?

1150
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:53,560
You think army man has the rights to beat
up a family man? You'll rot in hell!

1151
01:22:02,760 --> 01:22:03,960
The bank's blue print

1152
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:07,880
Blue print helps in building a house
but how in find the address?

1153
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:09,520
Why are you giving me that look?
Did I say something wrong?

1154
01:22:09,560 --> 01:22:11,920
The customer details are encrypted
in the bank's main server

1155
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,640
It can only be copied
from the server room

1156
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:20,320
According to the blue print, enter the
bank and on the left you've a basement

1157
01:22:20,360 --> 01:22:21,200
Isn't that the server room?

1158
01:22:21,240 --> 01:22:23,640
I had been to that bank.
It's highly secured bank

1159
01:22:26,440 --> 01:22:27,840
Especially, the server room

1160
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:30,000
The security officer possesses the
access card to the server room

1161
01:22:30,040 --> 01:22:31,720
It cannot be entered
without the access card

1162
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:35,280
You can chop that guy's hand without
his knowledge but can't steal his card

1163
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:37,000
His lunch time is 1 - 1:30

1164
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:39,000
He goes to his routine restaurant

1165
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:41,920
Is his lunch time fixed one?

1166
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:43,800
I confirmed it

1167
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:48,320
So, the half an hour lunch time
of that security officer...

1168
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:50,160
is when we can sneak
into the server room?

1169
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:51,240
The catch here is that...

1170
01:22:51,320 --> 01:22:54,120
the account that you want to access from
server room must be active to be copied

1171
01:22:54,160 --> 01:22:55,040
Or else nothing can be done

1172
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:57,680
Then, let's do one thing. Let
directly call Deepak Mehta..

1173
01:22:57,720 --> 01:23:01,360
and request him to keep his account active for
half an hour, so we can collect his details

1174
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:03,640
Oh come on! Hear out yourself!

1175
01:23:03,680 --> 01:23:07,120
Sounds like the rumour that Indian
2000 rupee bill has a chip in it!

1176
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:09,840
Subash, he only has
complaints about our ideas

1177
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:11,200
Why don't you give an idea?

1178
01:23:11,240 --> 01:23:13,480
I'm good at flapping my
gums and not giving ideas

1179
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:14,600
Get that?

1180
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:17,200
Now, that's an idea!

1181
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:20,560
The bank manager has a special
password to unlock all the accounts

1182
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:22,960
You must engage the
manager and somehow talk

1183
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:24,880
him into opening
Deepak Mehta's account

1184
01:23:24,920 --> 01:23:26,520
- I'll take care of the rest
- And?

1185
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:28,760
If things go awry and we get busted...

1186
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:31,960
We can't escape like we do in India by
saying "It wasn't me, it was my admin"

1187
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:33,600
This is Istanbul! We'll be doomed!

1188
01:23:33,640 --> 01:23:36,680
Idea, my foot! I'm your sister's husband
not your boxing sand bag!

1189
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:38,480
- Uh-oh! Again him!
- My sister told me...

1190
01:23:38,520 --> 01:23:41,720
"Be confident, my husband is there for you.
He'll take care of everything "

1191
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:43,360
But here? That's not the case

1192
01:23:43,400 --> 01:23:45,200
Did she really say that?

1193
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:47,720
Yes

1194
01:23:48,040 --> 01:23:50,440
Baby, you really have so
much confidence in me?

1195
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:51,680
I won't give up

1196
01:23:51,720 --> 01:23:53,360
Now that my wife has said it...

1197
01:23:53,440 --> 01:23:54,920
there is no going back!

1198
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:56,960
- I will deal the bank manager!
- Come on

1199
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,160
Let's chew some mint and
work on that blueprint!

1200
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:06,120
If something happens to me in there...

1201
01:24:06,160 --> 01:24:09,840
then like now, please ask your family
to keep taking care of your sister

1202
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:13,040
To hell with the confidence she has on me!
I pity my plight!

1203
01:24:47,720 --> 01:24:49,480
What happened?
Are you ok?

1204
01:24:54,200 --> 01:24:56,040
Ouch! I'm on my way

1205
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:07,920
Excuse me, sir

1206
01:25:08,280 --> 01:25:09,520
Rajesh Malhothra?

1207
01:25:09,560 --> 01:25:10,600
Are you a North Indian?

1208
01:25:10,640 --> 01:25:13,560
Yes. I also worked in Tamizh Nadu
for 10 years doing some crap jobs

1209
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:16,200
Of course, that's were
you all your crap jobs!

1210
01:25:16,240 --> 01:25:17,360
So, I need a small help from you

1211
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:19,160
Can you confirm if there has been
a transfer to my account?

1212
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:21,160
You could have checked it online

1213
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:23,280
But the internet data
isn't sufficient enough

1214
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:24,920
The download limit gets over
before a full movie is downloaded

1215
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:27,600
Yesterday I tried downloading a movie
titled "My aunt and the plumber"

1216
01:25:27,640 --> 01:25:32,080
The aunt meets the plumber, the start
talking and they slowly move to bedroom...

1217
01:25:32,120 --> 01:25:34,640
and done! It keeps buffering.
Keeps going round and round

1218
01:25:34,680 --> 01:25:36,400
Ok. Ok, tell me your account number

1219
01:25:36,480 --> 01:25:39,000
"75432256"

1220
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:09,440
Subash...

1221
01:26:09,480 --> 01:26:10,440
ask him to do it fast

1222
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:12,480
- Don't you order me!
- When did I order you?

1223
01:26:12,520 --> 01:26:14,360
Not you, sir. You focus
on the account details

1224
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:16,920
No amount has been credited in
your account in recent times

1225
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:20,000
Sir, please confirm! They guy who
promised me to transfer is from Madurai!

1226
01:26:20,040 --> 01:26:20,680
So what?

1227
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:22,160
People from Madurai never lie!

1228
01:26:22,200 --> 01:26:23,600
You fool!

1229
01:26:23,640 --> 01:26:26,880
Not the time to talk patriotism! Try
making him access Deepak's account

1230
01:26:28,120 --> 01:26:30,960
Sir, if you don't mind, I'll tell you that
guy's account number.

1231
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:31,960
Can you check his account?

1232
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,200
How can I access someone's account
without their permission?

1233
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:36,760
If David Bekcham questioned himself 'How?'
then he wouldn't have wooed Victoria!

1234
01:26:36,840 --> 01:26:38,600
Arnold Schwarzenegger wouldn't have
acted in Noodles advertisement?

1235
01:26:38,640 --> 01:26:40,360
- And Trump wouldn't have been wrestled in WWE
- Trump?

1236
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:42,480
He is a good wrestler!
Recently, his videos...

1237
01:26:42,520 --> 01:26:45,640
- Give that guy's account number
- "79543299"

1238
01:26:56,360 --> 01:26:58,080
Got access to his account

1239
01:26:58,120 --> 01:27:00,360
No money has been transferred
from this account

1240
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:01,920
Don't allow him to close
that account window

1241
01:27:01,960 --> 01:27:04,400
Keep him engaged for ten minutes so
that he doesn't log out, you fool!

1242
01:27:04,440 --> 01:27:05,960
Whom are you calling a fool?

1243
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,200
- What?
- I'm the fool, sir! I'm the fool!

1244
01:27:08,240 --> 01:27:10,840
I'm a fool to believe that
he will pay me on time!

1245
01:27:11,160 --> 01:27:12,800
Subash, how long will it take?

1246
01:27:12,840 --> 01:27:13,800
Ten minutes Diya

1247
01:27:14,280 --> 01:27:15,280
Ok, cool

1248
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:19,480
This is a high value account. This
account holder is a big shot

1249
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:22,280
Was it really him, who
cheated you by not paying?

1250
01:27:22,360 --> 01:27:24,240
Those who promise to
pay are the one...

1251
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:27,680
Why are you unnecessarily
talking about politics?

1252
01:27:27,720 --> 01:27:30,280
How do I engage him for 10
minutes without talking?

1253
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:32,280
Talking isn't as easy as hacking!

1254
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:33,360
Do something!

1255
01:27:37,960 --> 01:27:39,920
Subash...make it fast

1256
01:27:40,200 --> 01:27:41,120
What happened?

1257
01:27:41,160 --> 01:27:43,720
I think he has realized that
his access card is missing

1258
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:46,840
Subash!

1259
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:49,440
He is one his way to the bank.
Fast!

1260
01:27:57,040 --> 01:27:59,240
Diya, I just got access to his account

1261
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:01,960
Just now I started copying. Hold
him somehow, for few minutes

1262
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:02,680
Impossible

1263
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:04,320
Impossible? Then I'm leaving!

1264
01:28:04,360 --> 01:28:05,160
Ok

1265
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:06,960
I'll kill you!
Only 30% completed

1266
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:08,440
Somehow keep him engaged

1267
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:10,080
And how do you think I'll do it?

1268
01:28:10,120 --> 01:28:12,360
- Sir! You were born on the 10th, right?
- No

1269
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:15,880
I knew it! You couldn't have been
born on the 10th. Show me your palm

1270
01:28:18,120 --> 01:28:19,320
Diya, do something!

1271
01:28:20,240 --> 01:28:21,360
Sure! Will try

1272
01:28:23,720 --> 01:28:26,960
You prefer dark and dusky women
over fair and bright women

1273
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:28,520
- Correct?
- Yes! How did you know?

1274
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:30,200
That's the psychology of flirts!

1275
01:28:49,640 --> 01:28:51,880
Your palm tells me that
your wife will always be a loner

1276
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:53,800
Which is why you
are working here!

1277
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:58,120
Hey, who are you? Stop!

1278
01:28:58,160 --> 01:28:59,760
- Hey, stop!
- Check him now

1279
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:01,760
- Check him!
- What are you doing? Leave me

1280
01:29:03,160 --> 01:29:04,520
How much more to go?

1281
01:29:06,920 --> 01:29:07,920
40%

1282
01:29:07,960 --> 01:29:09,360
I'm a security officer in the bank!

1283
01:29:09,400 --> 01:29:11,720
- What is this?
- I don't how it came to my pocket

1284
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:15,760
- According to palm reading, your stars...
- Leave my hand!

1285
01:29:15,800 --> 01:29:17,720
- Here, take this money
- No, we don't want your money!

1286
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:19,200
Leave me! Leave me!
I'm in a hurry

1287
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:23,160
So, as per as astrology the
Jupiter and the Venus...

1288
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:24,440
Enough! Leave my hands!

1289
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:25,520
How much should he pay you?

1290
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:27,200
- 400 dollars
- I'll pay you!

1291
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:31,040
Oh my God!

1292
01:29:32,040 --> 01:29:33,040
What happened, sir?

1293
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:35,520
Someone hacked the password I
had and accessed this account

1294
01:29:35,560 --> 01:29:38,560
Someone is transferring the money
from this account to another!

1295
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:39,520
Crap!

1296
01:29:39,560 --> 01:29:41,680
Superb sir! Ask him to
transfer my 400 dollars too?

1297
01:29:41,720 --> 01:29:43,120
Get lost!

1298
01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:55,320
You idiot!

1299
01:29:55,360 --> 01:29:56,400
Get lost you monkey!

1300
01:29:59,960 --> 01:30:02,640
- What's happening there? Idiot!
- I don't know, sir. Let's check

1301
01:30:02,680 --> 01:30:03,880
I lost my access card

1302
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:08,880
- Let's go
- He is trapped!

1303
01:30:10,600 --> 01:30:12,720
- Just move
- Where are you taking me?

1304
01:31:44,160 --> 01:31:44,960
It's over!

1305
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:46,200
He must be caught red handed

1306
01:31:46,240 --> 01:31:48,040
You have no idea about
this country's police

1307
01:31:48,080 --> 01:31:49,640
There is a very sever punishment...

1308
01:31:49,680 --> 01:31:51,400
where they will bend the
culprit and bump with a stick!

1309
01:31:51,440 --> 01:31:53,000
It'll take days to recover from that

1310
01:31:53,040 --> 01:31:53,880
Oh!

1311
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,280
Oh? Walk slower and
let's get caught!

1312
01:31:56,320 --> 01:31:57,400
Where are you going?

1313
01:31:57,440 --> 01:31:58,760
I'm hungry. I'm going to grab a bite

1314
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:00,640
Got it. You got him trapped in server room

1315
01:32:00,680 --> 01:32:03,280
Now you got no money, so you'll
eat here and get me trapped!

1316
01:32:03,320 --> 01:32:06,840
So, tell me. Are you alone in
this or do you have a team?

1317
01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:08,000
Whoa! Brother-in-law!

1318
01:32:09,360 --> 01:32:10,200
Did you decode it?

1319
01:32:10,240 --> 01:32:11,280
70% decoded

1320
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:14,320
I was panicking that you're trapped and
what are you doing here on the laptop?

1321
01:32:14,360 --> 01:32:16,160
So, you already knew he was here?

1322
01:32:16,200 --> 01:32:16,960
Yes

1323
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:17,960
Wasn't that the plan?

1324
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,160
Don't show off that you pulled of a
small part without my knowledge!

1325
01:32:20,200 --> 01:32:22,400
Now hear me out. Let me tell
you the important part!

1326
01:32:22,440 --> 01:32:26,400
Someone stole 40 billion rupees
from Deepak Mehta's account!

1327
01:32:26,440 --> 01:32:27,440
I know

1328
01:32:27,480 --> 01:32:28,960
- You know?
- It was me

1329
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:30,080
- You?
- Of course!

1330
01:32:30,120 --> 01:32:32,440
You thought I took such a huge
risk for just an address?

1331
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:34,640
Pay 50 Lira and you can
easily get anyone's address

1332
01:32:34,680 --> 01:32:35,800
40 billion rupees!

1333
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:37,440
Money that belongs to our nation!

1334
01:32:37,480 --> 01:32:40,640
My dad approved it and he
thinks he'll abscond with it?

1335
01:32:40,680 --> 01:32:42,400
Do you expect me to
be a mute spectator?

1336
01:32:42,440 --> 01:32:43,560
Deepak Mehta's account...

1337
01:32:44,080 --> 01:32:47,080
and from his proxy accounts, including
the interest for that 40 billion...

1338
01:32:47,160 --> 01:32:50,040
I transferred the amount to the
bank that loaned him that money

1339
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:51,560
So, I am the fool here. Isn't it?

1340
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:53,560
You always have been one!

1341
01:32:55,640 --> 01:32:57,040
Also, we have his location

1342
01:32:58,680 --> 01:32:59,440
Algornia

1343
01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:01,760
Uh-oh! Algornia?

1344
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:03,560
I thought I'll only lose my job

1345
01:33:03,640 --> 01:33:04,480
I'll lose my life too

1346
01:33:04,520 --> 01:33:05,200
Why?

1347
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:07,800
It's a locality completely
controlled by the mafia

1348
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:11,200
Yes! No army or police can
break in to that area

1349
01:33:11,240 --> 01:33:12,880
Mafia rules over that place

1350
01:33:12,920 --> 01:33:17,400
If we still want to go there, then
someone must invite us from there

1351
01:33:19,960 --> 01:33:22,360
Diya, do you know someone in that place?

1352
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:23,680
No

1353
01:33:23,720 --> 01:33:25,120
She is new here and you ask her?

1354
01:33:25,160 --> 01:33:27,480
I've been here for the past four years.
Won't you ask me?

1355
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:29,720
Not even in my wildest dreams I thought
you'll have contact with anyone in Mafia

1356
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:32,360
I have no contacts with the mafia
but I have contact called Sofia

1357
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:33,240
Sofia?

1358
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:34,480
Who's that?

1359
01:33:34,520 --> 01:33:35,400
My girlfriend

1360
01:33:35,440 --> 01:33:36,440
She lives there

1361
01:33:36,840 --> 01:33:37,760
Oh God!

1362
01:33:41,080 --> 01:33:42,040
Is it painful?

1363
01:33:42,360 --> 01:33:43,360
Not bad

1364
01:33:45,280 --> 01:33:46,920
Near him and he'll hit me

1365
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:48,080
Let me sit here

1366
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:49,800
Dear brother-in-law...

1367
01:33:49,840 --> 01:33:51,720
calm down and put yourself in my shoes

1368
01:33:51,760 --> 01:33:54,160
11 months in a year, your
sister stays with your family

1369
01:33:54,240 --> 01:33:57,240
You guys have a population of 1.2 billion in
a climate that's as hot as 105 degrees...

1370
01:33:57,280 --> 01:33:59,200
I live in -2 degree,
won't I need a...

1371
01:33:59,240 --> 01:34:01,160
- Justifying yourself?
- It's not like what you think!

1372
01:34:01,200 --> 01:34:03,240
I'm a pure soul. I just talk
to her and nothing else

1373
01:34:03,280 --> 01:34:04,960
I haven't even got a
glimpse of her yet

1374
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:06,160
We only talk over phone

1375
01:34:06,240 --> 01:34:07,600
Tomorrow's her birthday

1376
01:34:07,640 --> 01:34:08,920
She has invited me

1377
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:10,520
I shall take you along

1378
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:12,840
Can't wait till tomorrow.
We must go today!

1379
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:16,320
By now he'd have become alert knowing
that money has vanished from his account

1380
01:34:16,360 --> 01:34:18,840
We must catch him before
he takes the next step

1381
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:20,600
- Let's go
- Forget about catching him...

1382
01:34:20,640 --> 01:34:23,000
Don't tell your sister
about me catching Sofia!

1383
01:34:23,040 --> 01:34:25,000
Your sister is not like you.
You hit me then and there

1384
01:34:25,040 --> 01:34:26,080
She'll beat me nice and slow

1385
01:34:26,120 --> 01:34:28,600
Think of my wife and my hand shivers,
my leg trembles and I panic!

1386
01:34:28,640 --> 01:34:30,080
Yet, I won't give up!

1387
01:34:30,160 --> 01:34:34,560
See that grand structure? That's the
entrance to this mafia locality

1388
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:36,520
The security will be on a
whole different level here!

1389
01:34:36,560 --> 01:34:39,720
Like a the Rose with thorns all
around it's stem; my Sofia lives here

1390
01:34:39,760 --> 01:34:40,560
Worst simile ever!

1391
01:34:40,600 --> 01:34:42,800
Not good? How about "A
gold fish in the sewage"

1392
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:44,040
- Shut up!
- Thank you

1393
01:34:45,160 --> 01:34:48,080
Hey, I want to meet Sofia

1394
01:34:48,200 --> 01:34:49,160
Wait

1395
01:34:50,040 --> 01:34:52,040
Someone's here to meet
Sofia, check with her

1396
01:34:52,080 --> 01:34:53,040
Name is Sofia

1397
01:34:53,080 --> 01:34:55,600
Why do you always carry yourself
like you are about to fight?

1398
01:34:55,640 --> 01:34:57,320
Lower your shoulders!
Relax your chest!

1399
01:34:57,360 --> 01:34:59,480
Have a humble body language or else
only our bodies will leave from here

1400
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:00,400
Got it?

1401
01:35:00,440 --> 01:35:02,320
He is my man.
Please send him in

1402
01:35:02,360 --> 01:35:03,240
Sofia!

1403
01:35:03,280 --> 01:35:05,400
That voice is what I fell for

1404
01:35:05,920 --> 01:35:06,680
Sofia!

1405
01:35:06,720 --> 01:35:07,880
You got 10 minutes. Now, go

1406
01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:11,200
They have only allotted 10 minutes. We
can only walk in from here. Come on

1407
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:19,880
Where does Sofia live?

1408
01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:20,640
There

1409
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:23,400
Dear brother-in-law...

1410
01:35:23,480 --> 01:35:25,480
I'll talk to Sofia and get your work
done in a smooth manner. Have patience

1411
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:27,800
- Sophie!
- Yes please

1412
01:35:28,680 --> 01:35:30,000
- Hello
- Sofia?

1413
01:35:30,040 --> 01:35:32,040
No. I am her maid

1414
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:33,880
If the maid is so beautiful...

1415
01:35:33,920 --> 01:35:36,360
then imagine about the lady of this house!
What do you say?

1416
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:37,440
Dear brother-in-law?

1417
01:35:37,480 --> 01:35:38,320
Dear brother-in-law?

1418
01:35:38,360 --> 01:35:40,680
Near or away; he's
always a trouble!

1419
01:35:45,800 --> 01:35:47,720
Left, Subash.
The map says so

1420
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:52,480
Where is Sofia?

1421
01:35:52,520 --> 01:35:54,080
Wait. She'll come

1422
01:35:55,080 --> 01:35:57,160
Today's my lucky day! Lucky day!

1423
01:36:11,560 --> 01:36:12,360
Sofia?

1424
01:36:12,440 --> 01:36:14,880
Yes, darling. I'm your Sofia

1425
01:36:14,920 --> 01:36:15,920
Darling?

1426
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:20,400
- Darling
- To hell with you!

1427
01:36:20,440 --> 01:36:21,800
Thank God he didn't see this

1428
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:24,880
I better escaped from her!
Run! Run!

1429
01:36:25,120 --> 01:36:26,160
Here

1430
01:36:28,200 --> 01:36:29,200
Where?

1431
01:36:29,360 --> 01:36:30,720
The second house on the left

1432
01:36:30,760 --> 01:36:32,360
- You wait here
- Ok

1433
01:37:11,240 --> 01:37:12,320
Deepak!

1434
01:37:45,680 --> 01:37:46,760
Abort!

1435
01:38:07,280 --> 01:38:08,600
Get her!

1436
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:12,680
Open it!

1437
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:10,240
Don't let them escape

1438
01:40:46,440 --> 01:40:47,720
Hold it

1439
01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:50,520
Go!

1440
01:41:55,120 --> 01:41:56,200
All set?

1441
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:00,080
Go! Go!

1442
01:42:00,720 --> 01:42:01,760
Go fast!

1443
01:43:03,760 --> 01:43:05,920
Go! Go! Go fast!

1444
01:43:42,760 --> 01:43:43,960
You!

1445
01:43:46,360 --> 01:43:48,680
Why did you ask me to
come to her house?

1446
01:43:48,720 --> 01:43:50,080
Why have the police
rounded up my house?

1447
01:43:50,120 --> 01:43:51,440
Check with the Kimlik card

1448
01:43:55,360 --> 01:43:57,080
What is he up to?

1449
01:44:01,840 --> 01:44:05,040
First; you robbed the bank!
Now; a murder?

1450
01:44:05,120 --> 01:44:07,320
Help me oh God! I'm scared!

1451
01:44:09,480 --> 01:44:10,640
Got it

1452
01:44:21,200 --> 01:44:24,320
Our guess was wrong.
He isn't a criminal

1453
01:44:34,600 --> 01:44:36,480
He's the Istanbul city commissioner

1454
01:44:36,520 --> 01:44:38,920
What's going on here?
Explain it to me!

1455
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:41,800
He played blind and...

1456
01:44:41,840 --> 01:44:43,200
murdered Deepak

1457
01:44:43,440 --> 01:44:45,400
He framed me for that murder...

1458
01:44:45,440 --> 01:44:46,520
and tried nabbing me

1459
01:44:46,560 --> 01:44:48,160
Why must he murder Deepak?

1460
01:44:48,240 --> 01:44:49,640
That's what even I don't understand

1461
01:44:49,680 --> 01:44:51,840
I thought once I catch hold of
Deepak everything will be over

1462
01:44:51,880 --> 01:44:53,000
Deepak is just another bait

1463
01:44:53,040 --> 01:44:54,960
Catch him and we can find
out who's behind all this

1464
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:56,000
He is a cop

1465
01:44:56,040 --> 01:44:56,880
How can we catch him?

1466
01:44:56,920 --> 01:44:58,720
We must make him find us

1467
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,800
Diya, whom you're looking
for, is in Argub market

1468
01:45:22,760 --> 01:45:23,440
Tell me...

1469
01:45:23,480 --> 01:45:25,880
Whom do you work for?
Who's behind all this?

1470
01:45:26,720 --> 01:45:28,160
Refuse and you'll die!

1471
01:45:28,240 --> 01:45:29,280
Tell me!

1472
01:45:29,320 --> 01:45:31,280
Refuse and I'll die!

1473
01:45:31,320 --> 01:45:33,600
Say it and you'll die!

1474
01:45:33,640 --> 01:45:35,080
Then you die first!

1475
01:45:37,280 --> 01:45:38,800
I'll tell you! I'll tell you!

1476
01:45:38,880 --> 01:45:39,920
Ok! I'll tell!

1477
01:45:39,960 --> 01:45:41,360
Tell me.

1478
01:45:42,320 --> 01:45:43,640
Malik!

1479
01:45:47,760 --> 01:45:51,960
Syed Ibrahim Malik

1480
01:45:52,920 --> 01:45:56,400
Bomb blast in Mumbai! 247 feared dead!

1481
01:45:56,480 --> 01:45:59,080
Under world don, Syed Ibrahim
Malik behind the blasts

1482
01:45:59,120 --> 01:46:01,560
Syed Ibrahim Malik absconds to Dubai

1483
01:46:01,640 --> 01:46:04,120
Syed Ibrahim Malik behind
Hyderabad bomb blast too

1484
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:07,400
60 feared dead in Kovai bomb blast.
Malik, the man behind the blast

1485
01:46:08,440 --> 01:46:10,920
Malik escapes to Pakistan from Dubai

1486
01:46:10,960 --> 01:46:14,440
Pakistan government denies the fact
that Malik is hiding in their country

1487
01:46:14,960 --> 01:46:19,480
UN accepts India's plea and declares
Syed Ibrahim Malik as an Global terrorist

1488
01:46:20,880 --> 01:46:24,280
Malik's hideout in Pakistan exposed!

1489
01:46:24,320 --> 01:46:26,560
Terror that haunts India - Syed Ibrahim Malik!

1490
01:46:26,600 --> 01:46:30,360
India's most wanted terrorist
Syed Ibrahim Malik!

1491
01:46:30,400 --> 01:46:31,960
The search is still on!

1492
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:36,080
I just can't believe this. How
come Malik is involved in this?

1493
01:46:36,120 --> 01:46:37,840
It's only now I got a
clear idea about this

1494
01:46:37,880 --> 01:46:40,480
Gupta ji was set to win the upcoming
election and become the prime minister

1495
01:46:40,520 --> 01:46:42,720
Malik knew that he'd be
danger if Gupta ji wins

1496
01:46:42,760 --> 01:46:46,000
If he'd finished of Gupta ji in North India,
automatically the fingers would point at him

1497
01:46:46,040 --> 01:46:48,360
To avoid getting blamed,
the place he chose was...

1498
01:46:48,400 --> 01:46:49,400
Tamizh Nadu!

1499
01:46:49,440 --> 01:46:52,360
The political meet in Tamizh
Nadu worked in his favor

1500
01:46:52,400 --> 01:46:55,600
Deepak who was desperately in need of
money and professional killer, Kiara...

1501
01:46:55,640 --> 01:46:57,720
He used both of them and
finished off Gupta ji

1502
01:46:57,760 --> 01:47:01,800
He framed my brother by spreading rumour
that he did all this to win the election

1503
01:47:01,840 --> 01:47:03,760
Then he murdered my brother so
that people believed that rumour

1504
01:47:03,840 --> 01:47:06,080
Let's say what you're saying
is true but we need proof!

1505
01:47:06,120 --> 01:47:07,920
Both, Kiara and Deepak are no more

1506
01:47:07,960 --> 01:47:10,240
Malik? Isn't he still alive?

1507
01:47:10,280 --> 01:47:13,000
- What do you mean?
- I'll bring Malik to justice!

1508
01:47:13,040 --> 01:47:15,600
Are you kidding me? We don't
even know his whereabouts

1509
01:47:17,400 --> 01:47:18,280
Pakistan

1510
01:47:18,840 --> 01:47:20,040
Only we believe that

1511
01:47:20,080 --> 01:47:21,560
Pakistan government still denies it

1512
01:47:21,600 --> 01:47:23,360
They even denied the fact
that Bin Laden was there

1513
01:47:23,400 --> 01:47:24,840
Wasn't he attacked and executed?

1514
01:47:24,880 --> 01:47:26,480
Come on, Subash! That was America!

1515
01:47:26,520 --> 01:47:28,280
There's difference between
their and our force

1516
01:47:28,320 --> 01:47:30,200
I realize that hence I'm not
going there as Colonel Subash!

1517
01:47:30,240 --> 01:47:31,640
I'm heading to Pakistan
just as an individual

1518
01:47:31,680 --> 01:47:35,400
Our agent has been spying for 10 years there.
He hasn't even got a glimpse of Malik!

1519
01:47:36,200 --> 01:47:38,080
Police, CB CID, CBI...

1520
01:47:38,120 --> 01:47:40,280
RAW, military, intelligence, customs etc.

1521
01:47:40,320 --> 01:47:42,920
There are millions of officers
in hundreds of department

1522
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:44,400
He is just one person!

1523
01:47:44,440 --> 01:47:47,040
Yet "can't get a glimpse of him",
"can't catch him", "can't nab him"...

1524
01:47:47,080 --> 01:47:48,840
all we keep saying is "can't",
I can't take it anymore!

1525
01:47:48,920 --> 01:47:50,320
Forget Gupta ji and my brother

1526
01:47:50,360 --> 01:47:53,960
247 people in Mumbai blast and
120 people in Hyderabad blast!

1527
01:47:54,040 --> 01:47:57,920
In 26 years more than 7000
people killed over 17 attacks!

1528
01:47:58,000 --> 01:47:59,400
What are we going
to answer to that?

1529
01:47:59,480 --> 01:48:01,280
Stop talking like crazy!
Go in search of him and...

1530
01:48:01,320 --> 01:48:02,560
I'll die?

1531
01:48:02,640 --> 01:48:03,680
I'm ok with that!

1532
01:48:03,720 --> 01:48:05,960
A sad ending is better
than an endless sadness

1533
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:07,640
I can understand your emotion

1534
01:48:07,680 --> 01:48:10,240
But officially I
cannot be of any help

1535
01:48:10,280 --> 01:48:11,880
It's ok, sir. I can manage

1536
01:48:11,920 --> 01:48:13,440
- I'll start at once
- You're leaving?

1537
01:48:13,480 --> 01:48:15,480
How will you go? You're
a wanted criminal here

1538
01:48:15,520 --> 01:48:17,760
Legally, you can't cross
the Istanbul border

1539
01:48:17,800 --> 01:48:21,880
The only way is by road through Syria, Iran,
Iraq and Afghanistan and that too illegally

1540
01:48:21,920 --> 01:48:23,640
Yes, that's what
we are trying for

1541
01:48:23,960 --> 01:48:26,520
If you're taking that route, then
I can help you but unofficially

1542
01:48:26,560 --> 01:48:29,880
Once you reach Pakistan,
contact our agent, Imran

1543
01:48:29,920 --> 01:48:30,720
But one condition...

1544
01:48:30,760 --> 01:48:32,840
This is an international issue
involving two nations

1545
01:48:32,880 --> 01:48:35,840
If you're caught or trapped
during this mission of yours...

1546
01:48:36,880 --> 01:48:38,880
I know, you will
have to let go of me

1547
01:48:38,960 --> 01:48:39,960
Thank you

1548
01:48:42,200 --> 01:48:43,320
Subash...

1549
01:48:43,360 --> 01:48:44,400
I'll join you

1550
01:48:45,680 --> 01:48:47,080
No. I'll take care of this

1551
01:48:47,120 --> 01:48:48,360
This is my personal problem

1552
01:48:48,400 --> 01:48:49,840
Which is why I said,
I'll join you

1553
01:48:49,880 --> 01:48:51,840
Look, she is saying it
because she means it

1554
01:48:51,920 --> 01:48:54,360
Take her along. How
long can you stay alone?

1555
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:56,240
Don't you need a companion?

1556
01:49:17,760 --> 01:49:24,720
"Smile at me or stare at me or
even if you think about me..."

1557
01:49:24,760 --> 01:49:27,080
"Even if you set me ablaze..."

1558
01:49:27,160 --> 01:49:31,720
"Love me or even if you
make me fall for you..."

1559
01:49:31,760 --> 01:49:36,120
"Hug me or even if you finish me off..."

1560
01:49:36,200 --> 01:49:38,680
"You drive me crazy"

1561
01:49:38,720 --> 01:49:41,600
"Your the only one I see all around me"

1562
01:49:41,640 --> 01:49:45,000
"No words of yours will ever hurt me"

1563
01:49:45,040 --> 01:49:47,880
"I am stuck in your love web"

1564
01:49:47,920 --> 01:49:50,440
"I'm stranded unable to confess my love"

1565
01:49:50,480 --> 01:49:54,760
"This silence is wearing us off"

1566
01:49:54,800 --> 01:50:01,600
"Smile at me or stare at me or
even if you think about me..."

1567
01:50:01,640 --> 01:50:04,640
"Even if you set me ablaze..."

1568
01:50:30,040 --> 01:50:34,680
"Let me bring out the love
that is dead inside you"

1569
01:50:34,720 --> 01:50:39,240
"Also let me shower
my love on you"

1570
01:50:39,320 --> 01:50:43,920
"I will love you forever"

1571
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:47,720
"I am waiting high and dry, for you"

1572
01:50:47,760 --> 01:50:52,320
"When you walk away in
silence, it kills me"

1573
01:50:52,360 --> 01:50:56,960
"Realizing there's no love for me, I
continue to be a good friend to you"

1574
01:50:57,040 --> 01:51:01,600
"Wish the time freezes when
I rest of your shoulder"

1575
01:51:01,680 --> 01:51:05,880
"Wish I could hug you and
never let go forever"

1576
01:51:06,240 --> 01:51:10,800
"Wish the time freezes when
I rest of your shoulder"

1577
01:51:10,880 --> 01:51:15,160
"Wish I could hug you and
never let go forever"

1578
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:47,680
"My day starts with thoughts about you"

1579
01:51:47,720 --> 01:51:52,320
"We are already lovers in my dream"

1580
01:51:52,360 --> 01:51:57,000
"I find myself lost in your eyes"

1581
01:51:57,040 --> 01:52:01,480
"My untold love for
you kills me everyday"

1582
01:52:01,520 --> 01:52:06,080
"Oh Love! Where are off to,
leaving me high and dry?"

1583
01:52:06,160 --> 01:52:10,960
"Please don't kill me with
that killer looks of yours"

1584
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:15,320
"Wish the time freezes when
I rest of your shoulder"

1585
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:19,920
"Wish I could hug you and
never let go forever"

1586
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:27,080
"Smile at me or stare at me or
even if you think about me..."

1587
01:52:27,120 --> 01:52:29,200
"Even if you set me ablaze..."

1588
01:52:29,240 --> 01:52:33,800
"Love me or even if you
make me fall for you..."

1589
01:52:33,840 --> 01:52:39,040
"Hug me or even if you finish me off..."

1590
01:53:07,160 --> 01:53:09,160
Excuse me, is this the
way to Nawaz Khan road?

1591
01:53:09,200 --> 01:53:10,400
No, that way

1592
01:53:16,960 --> 01:53:18,000
This way

1593
01:53:20,080 --> 01:53:21,360
Here to meet Mr. Imran

1594
01:53:21,400 --> 01:53:22,680
He is there, inside

1595
01:53:22,720 --> 01:53:24,400
Someone's here to meet you

1596
01:53:25,560 --> 01:53:26,240
Yes?

1597
01:53:26,280 --> 01:53:27,280
Please go inside

1598
01:53:29,760 --> 01:53:31,200
My niece is get married in Delhi

1599
01:53:31,240 --> 01:53:33,160
Here to get her wedding
dress stitched

1600
01:53:43,880 --> 01:53:46,320
Collect it from this
place after two days

1601
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:02,160
You want to abduct Malik to India
without anybody's knowledge?

1602
01:54:02,200 --> 01:54:03,040
No chance at all!

1603
01:54:03,080 --> 01:54:06,240
Do you think this is as
easy as a food take away?

1604
01:54:06,280 --> 01:54:09,280
Malik is under ISIS control

1605
01:54:09,320 --> 01:54:12,000
No one can bypass
them and near him!

1606
01:54:12,040 --> 01:54:14,560
It's been 10 years since I'm
here as an undercover cop

1607
01:54:14,600 --> 01:54:19,080
The assignment Rehman sir gave me was to
find just one evidence that he is here

1608
01:54:20,200 --> 01:54:24,360
Apart from stitching clothes I could
achieve nothing in all these years

1609
01:54:24,400 --> 01:54:26,600
In fact, I couldn't even
manage to get a glimpse of him

1610
01:54:26,640 --> 01:54:28,840
15 years ago...

1611
01:54:28,880 --> 01:54:31,920
RAW team caught him was
the last heard news

1612
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:36,480
Then they said that it wasn't
him but his body double...

1613
01:54:36,520 --> 01:54:38,000
tossing that news into the garbage!

1614
01:54:38,040 --> 01:54:39,840
That's when he escaped and came here

1615
01:54:39,880 --> 01:54:41,720
This government takes money from him...

1616
01:54:41,760 --> 01:54:44,440
and has provided him a palace with
all facilities and military security

1617
01:54:44,480 --> 01:54:46,400
They treat him like a king!

1618
01:54:48,520 --> 01:54:49,960
Can I see his house?

1619
01:54:58,080 --> 01:55:00,320
Why are they decorating the house?
Any occasion?

1620
01:55:00,360 --> 01:55:03,320
I heard that his daughter is
getting married in three days

1621
01:55:03,720 --> 01:55:05,160
Won't he step out for it?

1622
01:55:05,720 --> 01:55:06,840
No

1623
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:10,600
The news is that the wedding will take place
in his house itself, for security reasons

1624
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:22,600
Hey! What are you doing over there?

1625
01:55:22,640 --> 01:55:23,600
- Get out of here!
- Nothing

1626
01:55:23,640 --> 01:55:24,880
- Our car broke.
- Move! Leave!

1627
01:55:24,920 --> 01:55:25,880
We'll leave now

1628
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:26,880
Let's go

1629
01:55:37,960 --> 01:55:39,200
That's Tahir Iqbal

1630
01:55:39,280 --> 01:55:40,760
Pakistan military general

1631
01:55:43,520 --> 01:55:46,040
He takes care of Malik's
complete security

1632
01:55:46,520 --> 01:55:49,320
He has three layers of
security in Malik's house

1633
01:55:49,360 --> 01:55:51,600
First layer has Pakistan Police

1634
01:55:55,080 --> 01:55:56,440
In the second gate...

1635
01:55:56,480 --> 01:55:58,880
Trained commandos from
Pakistan military

1636
01:56:03,240 --> 01:56:05,400
And personal security
in the inner circle

1637
01:56:05,440 --> 01:56:07,800
He has a clear sketch
for Malik's protection

1638
01:56:07,840 --> 01:56:08,960
He isn't your ordinary normal officer

1639
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:12,080
He's an expert in SWAT and is also
the brain behind half of ISIS attacks

1640
01:56:12,160 --> 01:56:15,600
A specialist is brain washing youngsters
and turning them into terrorist

1641
01:56:15,640 --> 01:56:17,800
To bypass him and nab Malik is a tough task

1642
01:56:19,600 --> 01:56:21,240
It's all belongs to
my grand daughter

1643
01:56:21,280 --> 01:56:23,080
Tahir, day after tomorrow is
my grand daughter's wedding...

1644
01:56:23,160 --> 01:56:24,400
and you're still on duty?

1645
01:56:24,440 --> 01:56:26,160
Join the proceedings tomorrow
morning, along with your family

1646
01:56:26,200 --> 01:56:27,600
Check out this pearl necklace

1647
01:56:27,680 --> 01:56:28,600
Malik!

1648
01:56:29,280 --> 01:56:31,480
You must postpone your
daughter's wedding

1649
01:56:31,520 --> 01:56:34,320
Is it because of the Indian agent who
has crossed borders and reached here?

1650
01:56:34,360 --> 01:56:36,040
You want me to be scared of him?

1651
01:56:36,080 --> 01:56:37,200
How do you kno...

1652
01:56:37,280 --> 01:56:40,200
I found out about it even
before the news reached you

1653
01:56:40,240 --> 01:56:42,240
His name is Colonel Subash

1654
01:56:42,280 --> 01:56:45,360
Seed training, 19th battalion.
Madras regiment

1655
01:56:49,600 --> 01:56:51,480
That's his photo.
Get him!

1656
01:56:51,800 --> 01:56:52,440
I will!

1657
01:56:52,480 --> 01:56:55,560
Until this issue is resolved, you
better move to the safe house

1658
01:56:55,600 --> 01:56:57,640
Whole India is scared of me, Tahir!

1659
01:56:57,680 --> 01:57:00,400
And you want me to be scared
of an Indian, after all?

1660
01:57:00,440 --> 01:57:02,320
Look, your safety is my responsibility

1661
01:57:02,400 --> 01:57:05,040
So listen to me. You better
move to the military safe house

1662
01:57:05,960 --> 01:57:08,040
You think you are
responsible for my safety?

1663
01:57:08,280 --> 01:57:10,280
I have stood against a thousand
of them, all by myself!

1664
01:57:10,320 --> 01:57:12,640
But never expected
anyone's help or support!

1665
01:57:12,680 --> 01:57:15,520
It's my daughter's wedding
and I'm in a good mood!

1666
01:57:16,640 --> 01:57:19,280
Don't you spoil it or else you'll be dead!

1667
01:57:22,520 --> 01:57:25,080
The blueprint of his
house that you asked for

1668
01:57:26,160 --> 01:57:28,120
The best time to abduct him...

1669
01:57:29,120 --> 01:57:30,280
is that wedding

1670
01:57:30,840 --> 01:57:31,840
No chance!

1671
01:57:32,040 --> 01:57:33,880
Only very limited guests are invited

1672
01:57:33,920 --> 01:57:36,080
No one can enter without an invite

1673
01:57:36,120 --> 01:57:39,560
Even if you enter there will be police,
military and personal security

1674
01:57:39,640 --> 01:57:41,960
You can't go past them and reach him

1675
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:45,000
We can shoot him from a distance
and then get ourselves killed

1676
01:57:45,040 --> 01:57:46,880
Even that's tough. Abducting him...

1677
01:57:47,480 --> 01:57:48,680
is impossible

1678
01:57:50,480 --> 01:57:51,400
It's possible

1679
01:57:53,320 --> 01:57:54,240
There's a way

1680
01:57:54,280 --> 01:57:55,880
'Ministry of Home affairs, New Delhi'

1681
01:57:55,960 --> 01:57:59,120
Who gave you the permission
to approve this mission?

1682
01:57:59,200 --> 01:58:01,320
Subash is risking his life and
carrying out the mission on his own

1683
01:58:01,360 --> 01:58:03,600
All he expects from is
only a small favour

1684
01:58:03,680 --> 01:58:06,720
Mr. Rehman, with tension running
high between two nations...

1685
01:58:06,760 --> 01:58:08,280
if our officer gets
trapped there...

1686
01:58:08,320 --> 01:58:11,080
then using that UN
will support Pakistan

1687
01:58:11,160 --> 01:58:14,240
I'm not ready to risk the
goodwill of our country!

1688
01:58:14,280 --> 01:58:15,720
Call him back at once!

1689
01:58:15,800 --> 01:58:18,640
Or else I'll give a statement 'Without
our knowledge he trespassed the border'

1690
01:58:18,680 --> 01:58:23,040
And I'll have to give his complete
details to the Pakistan embassy

1691
01:58:23,120 --> 01:58:23,840
Sir...

1692
01:58:23,960 --> 01:58:25,960
please do not make any
such hasty decision

1693
01:58:26,040 --> 01:58:27,760
According to the information
gathered by Subash...

1694
01:58:27,800 --> 01:58:29,840
Malik alone is not behind
Mr. Gupta's murder

1695
01:58:29,880 --> 01:58:33,400
There is also a VVIP from
India involved in it

1696
01:58:34,600 --> 01:58:37,760
In order to prove it, we must
to bring down Malik here

1697
01:58:38,720 --> 01:58:39,760
Who is that?

1698
01:58:55,200 --> 01:58:55,920
Ok

1699
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:57,480
Let me talk to the high command

1700
01:58:57,520 --> 01:58:59,720
- Until then ask him to hold the mission
- Yes, sir

1701
01:59:02,760 --> 01:59:03,240
Sir?

1702
01:59:03,280 --> 01:59:07,040
Do not start the mission until we have
a green signal from the high command

1703
01:59:07,960 --> 01:59:09,560
I have already started the mission

1704
01:59:09,880 --> 01:59:11,160
Subash! Subash!

1705
01:59:43,440 --> 01:59:45,360
"He is here for revenge
but not with an army."

1706
01:59:45,400 --> 01:59:47,440
"But you are covered up by army like smoke"

1707
01:59:47,520 --> 01:59:49,160
"But when the smoke clears..."

1708
01:59:49,200 --> 01:59:53,120
and the gates open he will
pounce on you like a wild cat!"

1709
01:59:53,200 --> 01:59:58,000
"A fierce wild cat on the hunt!
So beware you foes!"

1710
01:59:58,040 --> 01:59:59,800
"So, step up leader! Who wanna die?"

1711
01:59:59,840 --> 02:00:02,520
"You can try! But give me a fight!
I'm taking your life!"

1712
02:00:02,600 --> 02:00:04,400
"You better be there right
at the end of the night"

1713
02:00:04,480 --> 02:00:06,360
"Or I'll be taking a shot
and shooing your loved one!"

1714
02:00:06,440 --> 02:00:08,320
"Because I'm a psycho
and I might blow!"

1715
02:00:08,360 --> 02:00:11,400
"I will blow your mind! Thank you
to all those who provoked me"

1716
02:00:11,520 --> 02:00:13,680
"I'm now going to put a bullet
through all their brains"

1717
02:00:13,760 --> 02:00:15,880
"An eye for eye! That's
what I believe in!"

1718
02:00:15,920 --> 02:00:18,000
"So, beware! Mess with me
and your death awaits you!"

1719
02:00:18,040 --> 02:00:20,920
"There is no way I'm showing mercy!"

1720
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:26,880
Subash...

1721
02:00:28,160 --> 02:00:29,640
Malik knows that you are here

1722
02:00:29,680 --> 02:00:32,480
Police are the on the hunt
for you based on his orders

1723
02:00:33,720 --> 02:00:35,600
Situation is getting more complicated

1724
02:00:36,680 --> 02:00:38,280
Our chances to succeed...

1725
02:00:38,680 --> 02:00:39,920
are slowly diminishing

1726
02:00:40,400 --> 02:00:42,000
Even a small mistake tomorrow...

1727
02:00:43,280 --> 02:00:44,680
will cost us our life

1728
02:00:46,040 --> 02:00:48,240
I'm not ready to involve you in this

1729
02:00:49,520 --> 02:00:51,040
This is my personal problem

1730
02:00:51,640 --> 02:00:52,760
I'll take care of it

1731
02:00:53,040 --> 02:00:53,680
You leave

1732
02:00:53,760 --> 02:00:54,720
It's ok

1733
02:00:54,960 --> 02:00:56,240
Let's face it together

1734
02:00:57,640 --> 02:00:59,160
Whatever happens hereafter...

1735
02:00:59,480 --> 02:01:00,960
I'm not leaving you

1736
02:01:04,360 --> 02:01:05,720
Ok, I'll take care.

1737
02:01:07,760 --> 02:01:08,880
- Bye
- Bye

1738
02:01:39,840 --> 02:01:40,680
Who are...

1739
02:02:07,200 --> 02:02:08,360
- Sir
- Subash...

1740
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:10,880
high command has given
the green signal

1741
02:02:12,400 --> 02:02:13,080
Thank you, sir

1742
02:02:13,120 --> 02:02:15,600
Be careful! It's not Malik arrest
that you're responsible for...

1743
02:02:15,640 --> 02:02:17,040
but also the honor of our nation!

1744
02:02:17,120 --> 02:02:18,560
Even a small slip...

1745
02:02:18,840 --> 02:02:20,640
will have severe reaction

1746
02:02:21,160 --> 02:02:22,400
All the best, my boy

1747
02:02:23,120 --> 02:02:24,040
Sir!

1748
02:02:37,640 --> 02:02:38,880
It's time for action!

1749
02:02:45,800 --> 02:02:49,240
"Oh Lord! Oh dear Lord!"

1750
02:02:49,320 --> 02:02:52,440
"Oh Lord! Oh dear Lord!"

1751
02:02:52,840 --> 02:02:56,360
"Oh Lord! Oh dear Lord!"

1752
02:02:56,400 --> 02:02:59,160
"Oh Lord! Oh dear Lord!"

1753
02:02:59,920 --> 02:03:06,480
"Oh love, it's time to unite"

1754
02:03:07,040 --> 02:03:13,840
"Time to embark on a journey
of happiness in life"

1755
02:03:14,160 --> 02:03:17,520
"Oh Lord! Oh dear Lord!"

1756
02:03:17,560 --> 02:03:20,760
"Oh Lord! Oh dear Lord!"

1757
02:03:21,080 --> 02:03:24,600
"Oh Lord! Oh dear Lord!"

1758
02:03:24,640 --> 02:03:27,960
"Oh Lord! Oh dear Lord!"

1759
02:03:28,920 --> 02:03:32,360
"Come on my baby,
we make an awesome couple"

1760
02:03:32,400 --> 02:03:35,880
"Let's celebrate our love and
thank everyone for joining us"

1761
02:03:35,960 --> 02:03:39,400
"Come on my baby, we
make an awesome couple"

1762
02:03:39,480 --> 02:03:43,040
"Let's celebrate our love and
thank everyone for joining us"

1763
02:03:56,480 --> 02:04:00,840
"Welcome to the queen's palace,
let's celebrate in her name"

1764
02:04:04,200 --> 02:04:08,640
"Welcome to the queen's palace,
let's celebrate in her name"

1765
02:04:11,240 --> 02:04:14,720
"Apple of my eyes,
oh my shining star"

1766
02:04:14,760 --> 02:04:18,400
"Apple of my eyes,
oh my shining star"

1767
02:04:18,440 --> 02:04:21,800
"When I see you as the rituals proceed..."

1768
02:04:21,880 --> 02:04:25,200
"I forget all the wait and
it makes my heart light"

1769
02:04:25,280 --> 02:04:28,680
"As you hold on to my hands..."

1770
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:32,840
"you make me feel like
a man, your husband"

1771
02:04:36,240 --> 02:04:43,400
"You are my everything,
You are my life"

1772
02:04:43,440 --> 02:04:49,480
"Walk into my life...
Walk into my life"

1773
02:04:50,160 --> 02:04:53,520
"Your love is all I need, nothing else"

1774
02:04:53,600 --> 02:04:55,520
"So, thank you for your love"

1775
02:04:55,600 --> 02:04:57,080
"I don't need anything else"

1776
02:04:57,160 --> 02:05:01,120
"Oh love, it's time to unite"

1777
02:05:01,160 --> 02:05:04,680
"Come on my baby, we
make an awesome couple"

1778
02:05:04,720 --> 02:05:08,200
"Let's celebrate our love and
thank everyone for joining us"

1779
02:05:08,280 --> 02:05:11,320
"Come on my baby, we
make an awesome couple"

1780
02:05:11,360 --> 02:05:15,080
"Let's celebrate our love and
thank everyone for joining us"

1781
02:05:15,160 --> 02:05:18,160
"Oh Lord! Oh dear Lord!"

1782
02:05:18,200 --> 02:05:21,400
"Oh Lord! Oh dear Lord!"

1783
02:05:21,600 --> 02:05:25,080
"Oh Lord! Oh dear Lord!"

1784
02:05:25,200 --> 02:05:28,720
"Oh Lord! Oh dear Lord!"

1785
02:05:28,800 --> 02:05:32,400
"Oh Lord! Oh dear Lord!"

1786
02:05:32,440 --> 02:05:35,840
"Oh Lord! Oh dear Lord!"

1787
02:05:35,880 --> 02:05:39,400
"Oh Lord! Oh dear Lord!"

1788
02:05:39,440 --> 02:05:42,640
"Oh Lord! Oh dear Lord!"

1789
02:07:18,920 --> 02:07:20,240
What's with the smoke?
What happened?

1790
02:07:20,280 --> 02:07:22,160
Some fire accident in the catering area

1791
02:07:28,800 --> 02:07:31,280
- First, go check what's happening! Go!
- Yes sir!

1792
02:07:42,360 --> 02:07:43,040
Hello

1793
02:07:43,080 --> 02:07:46,680
I doubt if it's the same Indian agent,
who is behind this fire accident

1794
02:07:46,720 --> 02:07:49,000
- You better...
- Hey! I'll take care of myself!

1795
02:07:49,040 --> 02:07:52,720
Shut up! If you had obeyed me
earlier this wouldn't have happened

1796
02:07:52,920 --> 02:07:56,520
Higher level officials are pressurizing
me to move you to the safe house!

1797
02:07:56,560 --> 02:07:57,320
Be ready!

1798
02:07:57,360 --> 02:07:58,280
Ok

1799
02:09:29,920 --> 02:09:32,600
- I'll kill him!
- I'll take care of it. First, your safety

1800
02:09:32,960 --> 02:09:35,840
He must have set some
trap at the main entrance

1801
02:09:35,880 --> 02:09:37,320
You exit through the rear gate

1802
02:09:37,400 --> 02:09:39,040
Take the Shah Alami market

1803
02:12:15,640 --> 02:12:18,440
He is escaping with my vehicle!
Catch him!

1804
02:13:30,880 --> 02:13:33,600
You Indian! Stop! I'll kill you!

1805
02:13:33,640 --> 02:13:34,680
Stop!

1806
02:14:11,840 --> 02:14:12,640
Come on

1807
02:14:20,920 --> 02:14:22,520
Malik sir is in the vehicle!

1808
02:15:19,280 --> 02:15:21,640
Your safety lies in being
quite and obeying me

1809
02:15:21,720 --> 02:15:23,760
Don't shoot.
You are mistaken

1810
02:15:23,800 --> 02:15:25,080
I'm the body double

1811
02:15:25,120 --> 02:15:26,720
The original Malik is downstairs

1812
02:15:26,760 --> 02:15:29,000
If you doubt it, I'll
ask him to come upstairs

1813
02:15:29,200 --> 02:15:29,840
Hello

1814
02:15:29,880 --> 02:15:31,600
What are you doing downstairs?
An important matter.

1815
02:15:31,640 --> 02:15:33,440
Come to my room! Now!

1816
02:15:37,400 --> 02:15:40,240
You just panicked and exposed yourself !
You're the original

1817
02:15:40,640 --> 02:15:44,000
They way you ordered him to come
to your room made it obvious!

1818
02:15:47,280 --> 02:15:48,800
I am scared!

1819
02:15:50,680 --> 02:15:51,600
Move, where?

1820
02:15:51,640 --> 02:15:54,440
Tahir will be here in two minutes
to escort me to the safe house

1821
02:15:54,480 --> 02:15:58,160
If you want to be alive,
then you better run away!

1822
02:15:58,640 --> 02:16:00,720
Ask your body double to go with Tahir

1823
02:16:05,400 --> 02:16:06,320
Do it!

1824
02:16:09,720 --> 02:16:11,320
- Hello
- Go with Tahir

1825
02:16:11,360 --> 02:16:12,840
- Sir?
- Just obey my order!

1826
02:16:12,880 --> 02:16:13,720
Ok

1827
02:16:15,240 --> 02:16:16,440
Now, move!

1828
02:17:12,240 --> 02:17:13,360
Careful

1829
02:17:58,160 --> 02:17:59,360
You may proceed

1830
02:18:00,120 --> 02:18:01,000
Next

1831
02:18:15,480 --> 02:18:16,800
What happened to him?

1832
02:18:16,840 --> 02:18:17,920
Medical Visa

1833
02:18:18,600 --> 02:18:21,040
Taking him for a kidney transplant surgery.
It's written in it

1834
02:18:21,080 --> 02:18:24,000
Don't we have better treatments here?
Why go to India?

1835
02:18:24,040 --> 02:18:26,440
AB negative donor are
only available there

1836
02:18:26,600 --> 02:18:27,480
Sir...

1837
02:18:27,840 --> 02:18:29,080
What's the matter?

1838
02:18:29,840 --> 02:18:31,280
This is his medical report

1839
02:18:31,320 --> 02:18:34,280
Looks fishy.
Can you please check it once

1840
02:18:56,720 --> 02:18:57,600
Hello

1841
02:18:57,800 --> 02:18:59,400
Calling from Pakistan immigration

1842
02:18:59,440 --> 02:19:01,080
This is an inquiry on patient
Mr. Zahir Rehman...

1843
02:19:01,120 --> 02:19:02,160
Yes, he's our patient

1844
02:19:02,200 --> 02:19:03,880
Tomorrow he has a surgery.
What's the matter?

1845
02:19:03,920 --> 02:19:06,160
- Nothing ma'am, just a routine checkup
- Ok

1846
02:19:10,120 --> 02:19:11,080
Allow them

1847
02:19:15,240 --> 02:19:16,320
Thank you

1848
02:19:19,400 --> 02:19:21,800
- How is he doing?
- Don't worry. Malik is fine

1849
02:19:35,600 --> 02:19:36,800
Happy journey

1850
02:19:58,960 --> 02:20:01,320
No tension. The doctor's treating him.
He will be fine

1851
02:20:01,360 --> 02:20:04,440
Malik is fine. Nothing to worry.
He'll be back to his sense in sometime

1852
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:24,960
Dear passengers, the
boarding is completed

1853
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:27,240
The flight is ready to take off

1854
02:20:27,320 --> 02:20:28,880
Please fasten your seat belts

1855
02:20:28,920 --> 02:20:31,720
Please switch off your mobiles
phones or put it in flight mode

1856
02:20:41,240 --> 02:20:43,040
Malik...are you ok?

1857
02:20:51,320 --> 02:20:53,120
FA908 enter runway 25

1858
02:20:53,160 --> 02:20:54,080
Roger! Entering

1859
02:20:54,120 --> 02:20:57,480
He diverted our attention by tricking us to
believe that he's kidnapping the duplicate!

1860
02:20:57,560 --> 02:21:00,280
And he abducted Malik in another way

1861
02:21:00,320 --> 02:21:02,800
He made a fool out of us by
just setting four tents on fire

1862
02:21:02,880 --> 02:21:05,320
But how far can he run away from me?

1863
02:21:05,360 --> 02:21:06,840
Tighten the security
in all the check posts

1864
02:21:06,880 --> 02:21:08,560
- Close all possible ways!
- Yes, sir

1865
02:21:09,960 --> 02:21:13,520
Is there any flight starting to India now?

1866
02:21:13,800 --> 02:21:16,360
In 10 minutes a flight
will take off to Delhi

1867
02:21:16,400 --> 02:21:19,360
Yes! Fax Subash's photo
to the airport security!

1868
02:21:19,400 --> 02:21:21,800
Ask them check and detain any
passenger who resembles him

1869
02:21:21,840 --> 02:21:23,320
Don't waste the time! Do it fast!

1870
02:21:23,360 --> 02:21:27,760
FA908, enter runway 25 and line
up after the departing flight

1871
02:21:27,800 --> 02:21:30,800

1872
02:21:40,920 --> 02:21:43,200
FA908 get ready, you're 2nd in the line up

02:21:43,240 --> 02:21:44,120
Roger

1874
02:21:44,360 --> 02:21:44,880
Hello!

1875
02:21:44,920 --> 02:21:46,920
There's a passenger in
seat 16L in flight to Delhi...

1876
02:21:46,960 --> 02:21:48,480
who matches the
resemblance mentioned

1877
02:21:48,560 --> 02:21:51,880
Then call the ATC and ask them to
stop the Delhi flight, immediately!

1878
02:21:52,040 --> 02:21:52,880
Yes sir!

1879
02:21:52,920 --> 02:21:54,960
Call up the ATC and ask them to
stop the Delhi flight at once!

1880
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:55,880
Roger. Waiting

1881
02:21:55,920 --> 02:21:57,960

Awesome, uncle! It was so thrilling
for me to hear your story

1926
02:27:45,720 --> 02:27:47,800
I wonder how thrilling
it'd have been for you

1927
02:27:48,840 --> 02:27:50,360

02:28:27,520 --> 02:28:29,600
He tried to escape while
being taken to prison

1938
02:28:29,640 --> 02:28:31,120

Awesome uncle!

1941
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:38,240
Like grandpa always says 'Bad things
will always happen to bad people'

02:28:38,280 --> 02:28:44,160
We request honorable President to honor
late Mr. RKS by unveiling his portrait

02:29:54,840 --> 02:29:55,920
No! Please!

1945
02:29:56,680 --> 02:29:58,280
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
