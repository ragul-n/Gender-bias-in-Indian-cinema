1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,291
.

2
00:01:50,625 --> 00:01:51,500
‘Greetings’

3
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:54,791
‘Starting from 12AM tonight…’

4
00:01:55,041 --> 00:01:56,666
‘All over the country…’

5
00:01:57,125 --> 00:01:58,166
‘Pay attention!’

6
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,291
‘There’s going to be complete
lockdown all over the country.’

7
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:05,625
‘To fight the deadly Coronavirus...’

8
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:12,416
‘Taking this step has
become the ultimatum.’

9
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,625
Hey, Peddi Reddy…

10
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:14,125
Yes?

11
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:15,416
Prime Minister is saying something?

12
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,500
It’s nothing really.

13
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:20,125
He said he’ll make sure that the
Corona Beer is available to everyone.

14
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:21,125
Oh, is it?
- Yeah.

15
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:22,375
Modi is a great person.

16
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:23,875
You fools!

17
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:26,000
Corona is not some beer or cheap liquor.

18
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,000
It’s a contagious virus.

19
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:28,625
It has spread to India now.

20
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:31,500
He’s saying that there’ll be
curfew all over India from tomorrow.

21
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:32,750
Drunkard rascals.

22
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:34,000
You think he’s serious?

23
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:35,875
It can’t spread in a hot country like ours.

24
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:37,625
Oh God!

25
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:43,000
Sure, Reddy?

26
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,875
It's ok, have it.

27
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,541
Oh, lord!

28
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:50,375
Alas!

29
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:53,250
How did you fall, old man?

30
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:54,666
You should watch your step.

31
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:56,166
Get up...
- My money!

32
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:58,875
Did you faint or something?

33
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:01,875
Did you get hurt?
- I'm okay, son..

34
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:06,625
Guess the old man is terrified of Corona.

35
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,291
He’s literally shivering.

36
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:29,625
“We won’t sit idle at home”

37
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:31,916
“We won’t leave the roads deserted”

38
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,375
“We won’t heed to any warnings”

39
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:36,875
“We won’t stop until we're beaten up”

40
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:39,500
“We’ll dry stuff on the terrace”

41
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,875
“We’ll roam the streets for groceries”

42
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:44,250
“We’ll play cards under a tree in groups”

43
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:46,500
“We’ll break the rules and still sing…”

44
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,000
“Go, Corona! Go, Corona! Go! Go!”

45
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,291
“Go, Corona! Go, Corona! Go! Go!”

46
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:53,625
“Go, Corona! Go, Corona! Go! Go!”

47
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:56,125
“Go, Corona! Go, Corona! Go! Go!”

48
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:58,541
“Go, Corona! Go, Corona! Go! Go!”

49
00:06:58,541 --> 00:07:00,875
“Go, Corona! Go, Corona! Go! Go!”

50
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:05,625
“Go, Corona! Go, Corona! Go! Go!”

51
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,041
“We don’t care how deadly the virus is”

52
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:10,500
“We’ve got bleaching powder”

53
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:13,041
“This virus can’t harm us”

54
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:15,375
“We’ve got Paracetamol in our pockets”

55
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:17,875
“Our State budget is in the wine shops”

56
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:20,125
“We wait in queue for alcohol”

57
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,500
“Nothing can stop us from getting high”

58
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:25,125
“Lockdown can’t keep us from having fun”

59
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:35,875
“We have online classes”

60
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:37,000
“But we listen to songs
in the background”

61
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,125
“We dream about having abs”

62
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,375
“But we keep hogging and napping”

63
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:40,625
“We watch new recipe videos”

64
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:41,875
“And ruin the entire kitchen”

65
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:44,250
“We make instant noodles
and hype it on Instagram”

66
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,625
“We purchase matching masks
and store them in our pockets”

67
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:49,041
“Even if we’re a little sick,
we pray to doctors”

68
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:50,250
“We stock up on groceries”

69
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:51,416
“We bathe in sanitizer”

70
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:54,000
“We hug each other at secret parties”

71
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,125
“We’ll nab you”

72
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:57,500
“We’ll nab you”

73
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,875
“We’ll nab you”

74
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:02,250
“We’ll nab you”

75
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:05,791
“When PM asks to clap”

76
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:08,291
“We bang the plates instead”

77
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:10,750
“When he asks to light lamps in the dark”

78
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,791
“We burst fireworks like it’s Diwali”

79
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:17,041
“Home has transformed into hell”

80
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:22,125
“We’ve been beaten to pulp"

81
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,666
“Marriage has gone haywire”

82
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:31,416
"Still wife has turned mommy"

83
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:46,500
“Go, Corona! Go, Corona! Go! Go!”

84
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:51,125
“Go, Corona! Go, Corona! Go! Go!”

85
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:56,000
“Go, Corona! Go, Corona! Go! Go!”

86
00:08:56,125 --> 00:09:00,791
“Go, Corona! Go, Corona! Go! Go!”

87
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,625
Hello…

88
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:17,791
Hey, dude…
- Hmm.

89
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:18,875
Yeah, tell me.

90
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:20,000
Lockdown has been lifted.

91
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,541
What!

92
00:09:20,009 --> 00:09:20,812
Have juice, son.

93
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:43,500
Damn! He’s still here.

94
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,041
Hey! Have breakfast and go.

95
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:47,125
He saw me.

96
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,125
Why do you look so nervous?

97
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:55,250
My results will be announced today.

98
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,666
You’re going to fail anyway.

99
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:57,875
Shut up!

100
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,041
Idli… Upma…

101
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:03,500
Corona vaccine is
being tested on monkeys.

102
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:04,791
Hey! Why don’t you volunteer?

103
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:06,125
At least this way, you’ll be in the news.

104
00:10:05,934 --> 00:10:07,535
In every movie where
father bashes the son…

105
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:07,666
Why don’t you go instead?

106
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,500
You keep taunting him all the time!

107
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,375
Dear, I made Prenchie Roast for you.

108
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:13,625
That’s not Prenchie
Roast. It’s French Toast.

109
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,166
What has he done to deserve that?

110
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,166
He’s been working all night.

111
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,625
Oh… Since when does
gaming come under work?

112
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:22,375
Dad, I’m not a gamer. I’m a game designer.

113
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:26,250
Listen. Our deeds should be awe-inspiring!

114
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:29,041
It's dishonoring to even
mention that you're my son.

115
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:30,375
I have a solution.

116
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:31,750
Tell them I’m your distant relative.

117
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:34,916


118
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:38,875


119
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:43,500


120
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:47,875


121
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:51,125


122
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:03,916


123
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:14,875


124
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,750


125
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:25,250
Father ends up a fool in the end.

126
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:34,250
Is it a girlfriend?

127
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,250
I’ll rip your skin off.

128
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,375
This is against our family principles.

129
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:38,125
My game is going viral.

130
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:39,500
It’s going to hit 1
million downloads soon.

131
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:41,125
That’s great, dear. Show me.

132
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:41,500
Here.

133
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:44,416
Our neighbor lady posted a video on
washing rice and got 4 million views.

134
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,541
You’re talking about views.
I’m talking about downloads, dad.

135
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:48,250
Do you even realize how big this is?

136
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,541
Why do you care about our
neighbor lady’s video anyway?

137
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,250
Wait and watch.

138
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:54,750
I will make headlines tomorrow.

139
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:56,291
What? Just by playing games?

140
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:58,875
I’m not a gamer. I’m a game designer!

141
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:02,375
If you ask me,
there isn't much difference.

142
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:03,625
Just a word here and there.

143
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,500
Leave it. What’s with
that neighbor lady’s video?

144
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:09,500
Umm… She.. Washed TikTok.. Holding Rice..

145
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:18,625
I guess the media found out
about my success before I did.

146
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:22,375
Only the local channels are here?

147
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,041
What about the National Media?

148
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,375
Are you Preeti?

149
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,125
What?

150
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,875
Move out of the way.

151
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,625
Congratulations, dear!

152
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:36,916
You made history by becoming
the first Telugu girl to top IIT.

153
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:47,750
Congrats, dear.

154
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:50,250
How do you feel as a father?

155
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:53,500
Our deeds should be awe-inspiring!

156
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:55,250
I taught my daughter the same.

157
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,625
What does your son do, sir?

158
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:01,166
Come on! He’s not my son.

159
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,791
He’s a distant relative.

160
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:08,375
Congrats, dear.

161
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:10,375
What’s the reason behind your success?

162
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:12,000
Good question.

163
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:13,125
Answer him, dear.

164
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:14,125
My brother.

165
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:18,250
He designed an app to easily
remember all my subjects.

166
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:19,375
It’s just like a game.

167
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:20,541
He made learning fun.

168
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:22,750
That’s what helped me crack IIT.

169
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:24,416
The entire credit goes to my brother.

170
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:26,416
What’s your brother’s name?

171
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,625
Mario.

172
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:35,375
"Gaming all the day
and night feels so bright."

173
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,250
"Gotta move yourself in the big puzzle."

174
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:42,250
"Save your lives for the next level."

175
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:47,375
"Streets are filled with
popping coins grab'em now."

176
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:51,041
"Gotta show your
skill like a one shot kill."

177
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:54,250
"Fell the thrill in your run down hill."

178
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:57,625
"This is just, the game of bloody life!"

179
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:04,625
"Yeah, come and feel the heat now!
move it now."

180
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:06,750
"Shake it now..Now!"

181
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,125
"Like you mean it."

182
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:10,750
"Gotta slay it...
Gotta beat it..."

183
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,750
"Come on feel it."

184
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:44,875
Maggie!

185
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:47,375
Maggie!

186
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:47,875
Ouch!!

187
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:49,625
Maggie!

188
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:57,625
What happened to him?

189
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,125
My jaw must be broken.

190
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,416
Guys… guess what?

191
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:02,125
What?

192
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:04,875
Our game has gone viral overnight.

193
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:06,500
It’s about to hit 1 million downloads.

194
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:07,541
Wow!

195
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:08,750
Yes!

196
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:09,916
No.

197
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:11,375
What’s wrong, man?

198
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:12,916
Corona…

199
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:15,375
Do you have it?

200
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:16,250
I’m afraid I might.

201
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:17,625
You idiot!
- Come on, bro.

202
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:20,000
By the way, where’s Kalyan?

203
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:21,000
He said he has an alliance.

204
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:21,625
Again?

205
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:22,250
Yeah.

206
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:25,750
He doesn’t learn his lesson no
matter how many times he gets rejected.

207
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:28,916
Hey, read the comments.
- Finally!

208
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:31,500
I’ll read the Google reviews.

209
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:33,000
‘Super game! Loved it!’

210
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:35,875
‘I was playing your game all night.’

211
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:37,791
‘Next levellllll!’

212
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:41,291
‘Your game is super intense.’

213
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:42,791
‘From Junior NTR fans.’

214
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,375
Read this.

215
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,416
‘Our kids are not eating
unless they get to play.’

216
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:48,541
Give that comment a like.

217
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:49,875
‘This game sucks.’

218
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:53,666
I guess he meant success.

219
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:57,250
‘Bro, game is crashing in
the higher levels, you ***!’

220
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:58,416
He’s cussing us, man.

221
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,125
The game is crashing?

222
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,666
Hey! Give me the phone.
- ‘Game is crashing. It’s crappy.’

223
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:08,750
How did this happen? Test runs were fine.
- Game crashes at higher level please don't download this game

224
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,416
There are bugs in the code, man.

225
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:23,000
Kalyan…

226
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:26,416
Hello...

227
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,791
Hey! Where are you, man?

228
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:29,375
She said okay, dude.

229
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,041
There are bugs in the
code you’ve written.

230
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:32,041
Come and fix it immediately.

231
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:33,500
Dude, I’m getting married tomorrow.

232
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:34,250
Seriously?!

233
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:35,791
Congratulations!
- Thank you...

234
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:37,000
Why are you getting married suddenly?

235
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,750
I couldn't wait any longer for the wedding night.

236
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,166
It’s 2 years of hard work.

237
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:45,000
If our ratings drop,
the game will lose the top rank.

238
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:48,541
I challenged my dad that
I’ll be in the news tomorrow.

239
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:50,125
Now I’d have to bow down to him.

240
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,375
Chill, mate.

241
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:53,416
Come here. I’ll fix it in an hour.

242
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:55,291
We’ll have the success
party at my wedding.

243
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:56,416
So, where are you getting married?

244
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:59,625
Come to Rudravaram in Kurnool
and ask for Mr. Bhuma Reddy’s house.

245
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,375
I will be right there, Uncle.

246
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:03,125
Rudravaram… Bhuma Reddy…

247
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:10,750
Did you intimate the priest?

248
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,000
He’ll be here by morning, sir.

249
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:12,625
Hmm.

250
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:14,500
I don’t want any mishaps at the wedding.

251
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:15,250
I'll take care sir.

252
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,916
Son-in-law grew up in the city.

253
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:19,250
Make sure the arrangements are prompt.

254
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:20,041
Sure, sir.

255
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:30,416
Hey! You all just hog on food.

256
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:31,750
Knock him right now!

257
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:36,791
If I was in the ring,
I would’ve cracked his head by now.

258
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:38,291
What are you looking at?

259
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:39,916
That’s impossible for you to do.

260
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Shut up and clean, you stinky fellow!

261
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:45,750
With the hands intended to kill enemies..

262
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:48,625
you’re making me clean your dentures,
Bloody old woman!..

263
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,250
Coming.

264
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:10,750
Yuck!

265
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:13,500
All the stink in the
world is in her mouth.

266
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:14,750
Nothing.

267
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:29,166
Your coffee.

268
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,250
This is Bukkareddy’s daughter.

269
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,750
She’s here for the wedding.

270
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:13,500
Bukkareddy’s daughter?

271
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,875
I bumped into her on the way.

272
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,000
You’re Bukkareddy’s daughter!

273
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,125
No wonder you are
so skillful with the stick.

274
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:23,416
You look exactly like your father.

275
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:24,916
How are you, Kasireddy?

276
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
What?! You know Kasireddy?

277
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:31,125
I also know that you didn’t kill
Narsireddy in Subbadu’s field, Masireddy.

278
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:32,500
What are you talking about?

279
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,250
It's me who killed Narsireddy.

280
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,375
How? Narsireddy died around 7’O clock.

281
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,166
You have night blindness after 6 PM.

282
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,041
My dad told me everything.

283
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:42,250
Your father sacrificed his life for me.

284
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:45,000
You're like a daughter to me.

285
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:48,750
Have fun at the wedding, dear.

286
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:50,125
Sure.

287
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:55,000
Hey! Are you the same
kid with the runny nose?

288
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:58,000
What’s your name, love?

289
00:19:58,791 --> 00:19:59,750
Nandini Reddy.

290
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:00,875
Come, let’s go inside.

291
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:04,500
Hey!

292
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:09,166
Son-in-law is a soft-hearted guy.

293
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,625
He’ll panic if he sees any weapons.

294
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:17,291
Hide everything until the wedding is over.

295
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:19,125
Got it, sir.

296
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:22,375
Even if there is a slightest suspicion,
that someone to be Veerareddy's henchman..

297
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,125
Stop...Stop.

298
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:43,875
You idiot! What’s with the driving?

299
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,250
Why did you scream?
- Hey punju!

300
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:46,916
You entered the enemy zone
not listening to me.

301
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:47,666
Now you’re dead!

302
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:49,375
She’ll never change.

303
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:51,125
Why did you stop here?

304
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:52,416
Do you have to pee?

305
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:55,250
After hearing you scream so loudly…

306
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:56,041
I literally peed my pants.

307
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:57,125
Dude, just drive.

308
00:20:57,625 --> 00:20:58,166
Let’s go.

309
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:07,250
Give me the pill.

310
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:19,541
What’s this for?

311
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,375
Malaria.

312
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:23,625
Do you have it?

313
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:25,500
I’m afraid I might catch it.

314
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:28,625
You idiot! You asked for all
kinds of pills since morning…

315
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:30,041
When clearly, you had nothing.

316
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:31,750
Damn it!

317
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:33,000
My phone!

318
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:58,625
Bro…

319
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,250
Bro!
- Hope he didn't die.

320
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:02,125
Oh, sh**!

321
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:04,250
You stay here, I’ll go get some water.

322
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:05,000
What happend?

323
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,750
Bro… Bro…

324
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:16,625
He’s alive.

325
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,500
Hey! Bhadram!

326
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,791
Mario! Mario!

327
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,166
What happened?

328
00:22:25,166 --> 00:22:25,916
He bit me.

329
00:22:26,375 --> 00:22:27,291
What are you saying?

330
00:22:42,625 --> 00:22:46,000
He is a mentally disturbed patient.
He got away.

331
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:48,125
How could you leave a
retard out in public?

332
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:50,750
Sorry.....Sorry.

333
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:56,875
Man, will I also go mad
if a mad guy bites me?

334
00:22:56,916 --> 00:22:58,166
Like you aren’t crazy already.

335
00:22:58,375 --> 00:23:01,291
Hey! Stop playing that
game and do first-aid.

336
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:05,291
Let me look at it.
- How could he bite me?

337
00:23:05,375 --> 00:23:07,125
I'll put a band aid,
- Nothing will happen,right?

338
00:23:07,125 --> 00:23:08,375
Don't worry. I'm here.

339
00:23:09,416 --> 00:23:11,500
Hey! I don’t have pills for
getting bitten by a mad guy.

340
00:23:11,541 --> 00:23:12,750
Let’s go back to Hyderabad.

341
00:23:12,875 --> 00:23:14,125
You’ve had enough pills.

342
00:23:14,166 --> 00:23:15,041
Shut up now.

343
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:39,541
Why is it suddenly hot again?

344
00:23:39,541 --> 00:23:41,750
Umm… Bro…

345
00:23:46,416 --> 00:23:48,416
Ah! It’s burning.

346
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,625
Who told you to put
your hand in his mouth?

347
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:52,916
I need to go to hospital
as soon as I get there.

348
00:23:56,291 --> 00:23:57,625
Hello, Excuse me.

349
00:23:57,666 --> 00:23:58,375
Yes?

350
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,125
Can you tell me where
Mr. Bhuma Reddy lives?

351
00:24:00,166 --> 00:24:01,500
Bhuma Reddy?!

352
00:24:04,791 --> 00:24:05,875
What is it about?

353
00:24:05,916 --> 00:24:06,875
We’re here for the wedding.

354
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:08,125
Oh, is it?

355
00:24:08,125 --> 00:24:09,791
How are you related to Bhuma Reddy?

356
00:24:10,166 --> 00:24:12,500
Let’s say the wedding will
be called off if we don’t go.

357
00:24:28,541 --> 00:24:30,000
I’ll take you there.

358
00:24:30,875 --> 00:24:31,541
Hop on.

359
00:24:32,875 --> 00:24:33,500
Where are you going?

360
00:24:33,625 --> 00:24:38,166
I'm Suredu, right hand to brother
Aagamreddy and Chandrudu is his left hand.

361
00:24:38,166 --> 00:24:39,041
Move!

362
00:24:44,375 --> 00:24:45,500
Aren’t you afraid of Corona?

363
00:24:45,625 --> 00:24:47,291
It spreads from not washing hands.

364
00:24:47,375 --> 00:24:48,750
So he need not worry.

365
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:49,500
Hey!

366
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,000
Sorry, bro.

367
00:24:55,125 --> 00:24:56,750
By the way,
how did you lose your arms, sir?

368
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:58,125
Let me say..

369
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:03,750
Those were the days he used to
chop off arms and legs leisurely.

370
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:10,541
One day we were waiting hillside
to attack our enemies.

371
00:25:12,625 --> 00:25:15,375
Back then, our brother Aagamreddy
resembled Raghubabu.

372
00:25:16,875 --> 00:25:18,375
He was crazy about cricket.

373
00:25:18,875 --> 00:25:23,041
It was his dream to win the
cricket cup at our village carnival.

374
00:25:24,125 --> 00:25:26,041
Game was intriguing.

375
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:28,250
Brother was paying close attention.

376
00:25:34,375 --> 00:25:35,875
Hey! Vehicles are coming closer.

377
00:25:37,166 --> 00:25:38,375
Bro… Bro…

378
00:25:38,625 --> 00:25:39,500
Our enemy is near.

379
00:25:41,666 --> 00:25:42,416
Hmm.

380
00:25:45,666 --> 00:25:47,666
Our enemy is here and
you are watching the match!

381
00:25:48,916 --> 00:25:49,666
Bro…
- What?

382
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,541
They found out that
we’re waiting to attack.

383
00:25:51,625 --> 00:25:52,875
What are you saying?

384
00:25:57,125 --> 00:25:59,625
Brother! Enemies know that
we’re waiting here to attack.

385
00:25:59,666 --> 00:26:00,416
Are you listening?

386
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:09,875
Last ball was in the air.

387
00:26:10,041 --> 00:26:12,291
Catch...Catch!
- Bro, they’re coming!

388
00:26:12,375 --> 00:26:16,000
Catch it...Catch it,
dude. Catch it!

389
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:17,541
Bro, are you listening?

390
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,166
Disregarding us all..

391
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:23,166
He leaped at it like Dhoni
and took the catch.

392
00:26:26,875 --> 00:26:28,250
Run, guys!

393
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:29,625
But it wasn’t the ball.

394
00:26:29,625 --> 00:26:30,416
It was a bomb.

395
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:34,625
Did the kid got out?

396
00:26:34,875 --> 00:26:37,125
No, Brother became crippled.

397
00:26:37,375 --> 00:26:39,375
Brother's face has changed by the
effect of bomb.

398
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,375
Take this route.

399
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:42,416
But Rudravaram is to the right.

400
00:26:42,416 --> 00:26:44,291
This is a shortcut.

401
00:26:53,541 --> 00:26:54,250
Stop the car.

402
00:26:55,375 --> 00:26:56,625
Baaji Reddy…

403
00:26:57,875 --> 00:26:59,875
They’re visiting Bhuma Reddy.

404
00:27:01,375 --> 00:27:02,375
Let’s drop them there.

405
00:27:04,875 --> 00:27:05,875
What is he for?

406
00:27:12,375 --> 00:27:13,750
Hey, Rami Reddy!

407
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:49,625
What did you do, doctor?

408
00:27:49,666 --> 00:27:51,625
Father is pretty upset with you.

409
00:27:51,875 --> 00:27:52,916
What’s the matter?

410
00:27:53,416 --> 00:27:54,000
Sir…

411
00:27:54,541 --> 00:27:57,125
Will you say it or should I?

412
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:05,625
You’ve been telling me that father
will be back on his feet in 90 days.

413
00:28:07,166 --> 00:28:12,000
But you’re going around telling
people that the old man will barely live.

414
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:17,041
It was a slip of tongue, sir.

415
00:28:17,541 --> 00:28:18,625
Forgive me.

416
00:28:23,541 --> 00:28:26,166
I won't repeat this again.

417
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
We asked you to cure
the old man’s illness.

418
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:32,291
But you’re making
fools out of us in public.

419
00:28:35,291 --> 00:28:38,375
I’ll not let go of his feet
till he recovers.

420
00:28:38,666 --> 00:28:41,000
I swear, I won't!

421
00:28:41,166 --> 00:28:42,250
Let's see!

422
00:28:43,041 --> 00:28:44,875
Sir... Sir, no!

423
00:29:53,916 --> 00:29:54,750
Boss!

424
00:30:06,666 --> 00:30:08,625
Look, who I have with me.

425
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
They’re here for the wedding
at Bhuma Reddy's house.

426
00:30:18,291 --> 00:30:19,875
Isn’t this Bhuma Reddy’s place?

427
00:30:23,416 --> 00:30:25,625
Bhuma Reddy’s relatives, is it?

428
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:38,750
I was wondering what
to send as a wedding gift.

429
00:30:39,625 --> 00:30:41,375
You’ve brought them on time.

430
00:30:42,875 --> 00:30:43,625
Never mind, sir.

431
00:30:43,666 --> 00:30:46,125
We’ll find the location on Google Maps.

432
00:30:46,166 --> 00:30:47,625
What’s the hurry?

433
00:30:47,791 --> 00:30:50,000
Experience our hospitality.

434
00:30:52,125 --> 00:30:53,875
What nonsense is this!
Come to the point.

435
00:30:55,666 --> 00:30:57,041
Oh, my! She didn’t mean you, sir.

436
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,666
Bhuma Reddy should instantly
recognize that they’ve been our guests.

437
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:05,500
Such petty threats are not new to us.

438
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,125
Get lost!

439
00:31:14,875 --> 00:31:15,875
Come on, guys!

440
00:31:46,916 --> 00:31:47,500
Finish him!

441
00:32:20,375 --> 00:32:21,000
Kill him!

442
00:32:38,166 --> 00:32:39,875
Brother!

443
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,500
Stop!

444
00:33:11,875 --> 00:33:13,291
Where would they go!

445
00:33:13,625 --> 00:33:14,750
Other than the wedding.

446
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:15,791
Let them go.

447
00:33:16,375 --> 00:33:18,500
They’ll have to come here
for the wedding toast.

448
00:33:30,666 --> 00:33:32,416
Listen to me now, at least.
Let’s go back to Hyderabad.

449
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,875
Hold on, man.
-Missed by a whisker.

450
00:33:34,166 --> 00:33:35,541
I almost had a stroke.

451
00:33:39,625 --> 00:33:44,166
Heard, Rayalaseema is a faction area.
How come its so boring.

452
00:33:48,375 --> 00:33:49,750
If we pissed our pants…

453
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,666
What about Kalyan!

454
00:34:07,291 --> 00:34:08,500
His phone is also not reachable.

455
00:34:08,875 --> 00:34:10,875
All those fields up to
the mountain belong to our Sir.

456
00:34:10,875 --> 00:34:12,625
He needs to know what happened.
- Relax guys.

457
00:34:12,625 --> 00:34:14,541
Listen to me. Let’s go back.
- We arrived.

458
00:34:16,125 --> 00:34:17,250
Ah!

459
00:34:19,291 --> 00:34:21,125
Hey! Who are they?

460
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:22,041
I don’t know.

461
00:34:22,041 --> 00:34:22,875
Let’s go take a look.

462
00:34:25,625 --> 00:34:27,416
Kalyan! Hey, Kalyan!

463
00:34:28,291 --> 00:34:29,125
Kalyan!

464
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,500
Where are you going?

465
00:34:30,541 --> 00:34:31,375
To meet Kalyan.

466
00:34:31,541 --> 00:34:32,041
Hold on.

467
00:34:32,125 --> 00:34:33,000
Who are you, man?
- Hey, Kalyan!

468
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Stop...

469
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:35,875
Mario!
- Who are you?

470
00:34:35,916 --> 00:34:37,625
Can't you see!
You pushed me off my vehicle.

471
00:34:37,625 --> 00:34:38,916
I didn’t dash into you. So, move!

472
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
How dare you talk back to Nandini!

473
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,125
Call Kalyan out here first.

474
00:34:42,166 --> 00:34:44,291
Who are you, man? What do you want?
- Mario!

475
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:50,000
Are they making you
a sacrificial lamb too?

476
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,875
It’s a ritual, man.

477
00:34:52,125 --> 00:34:53,791
Do you know what
happened on our way here?

478
00:34:53,875 --> 00:34:55,041
Hey!!!
- Hey Maggie.

479
00:34:55,125 --> 00:34:56,125
Congratulations!

480
00:34:56,166 --> 00:34:58,125
So, you’re finally getting married.

481
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:00,750
What’s with this girl?

482
00:35:00,791 --> 00:35:01,916
She applied wall paint on her hair.

483
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,791
How come you’re talking to humans now?

484
00:35:05,041 --> 00:35:06,041
My battery died.

485
00:35:06,041 --> 00:35:06,541
Oh!
- Move.

486
00:35:07,291 --> 00:35:08,791
Listen. Some guy named Veera Reddy…

487
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,875
Tried to kill us when we
mentioned your father-in-law.

488
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:11,916
Veera Reddy?!

489
00:35:12,625 --> 00:35:13,500
Who’s Veera Reddy?

490
00:35:14,125 --> 00:35:16,666
Ah, Veera Reddy! He’s our relative.

491
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:17,750
He must have pulled your leg.

492
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:18,750
Oh, just for fun.

493
00:35:18,791 --> 00:35:19,500
For fun?

494
00:35:19,541 --> 00:35:20,541
They threw an axe at me..

495
00:35:20,625 --> 00:35:22,875
It missed my head
cut the bottle gourd behind in half.

496
00:35:22,916 --> 00:35:25,500
What were you doing there when
they were chopping bottle gourds?

497
00:35:26,125 --> 00:35:27,041
You’ve got to believe me, man.

498
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,541
I swear I saw it with my own eyes.

499
00:35:28,666 --> 00:35:30,000
Aren't you blind though.

500
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,041
Hey!
- Hey!

501
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:32,875
Chill, dude!

502
00:35:32,875 --> 00:35:34,500
You’re stuck up in Samarasimha Reddy days.

503
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,375
These are Arjun Reddy times, bro!

504
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:37,000
Look at them.

505
00:35:37,125 --> 00:35:38,125
They wouldn’t hurt a fly.

506
00:35:38,125 --> 00:35:39,166
Such good hearted people!

507
00:35:39,166 --> 00:35:40,000
What’s that then?

508
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,750
That’s not for sacrifice.

509
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:44,625
It’s for donation.

510
00:35:44,625 --> 00:35:46,166
Yeah, right. Donation.

511
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:48,166
Just like how you donate cows.

512
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:50,875
How is it the same, you fool!

513
00:35:52,666 --> 00:35:53,500
Father-in-law!

514
00:35:54,166 --> 00:35:55,750
My friends are here for the wedding.

515
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:58,666
Yeah. Yeah. She told me everything.

516
00:35:58,916 --> 00:36:00,375
Smart kid.

517
00:36:02,166 --> 00:36:04,500
We’re happy to have you here.

518
00:36:04,666 --> 00:36:05,750
Kasi Reddy…
- Sir!

519
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:07,000
Drop them at the guest house.

520
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:07,541
Alright.

521
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:08,291
Let’s go, people.

522
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:10,375
Son-in-law, get ready quickly.

523
00:36:10,375 --> 00:36:11,500
Sure, uncle.

524
00:36:11,541 --> 00:36:12,125
Hey!

525
00:36:15,875 --> 00:36:18,000
Fix this game first. We’ll be on our way.

526
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
I’ll fix it. Meanwhile you go freshen up.
- Its getting late.

527
00:36:30,166 --> 00:36:30,916
Mario!

528
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:32,125
Let's go.

529
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:45,750
Coffee?

530
00:36:45,875 --> 00:36:46,416
No, thanks.

531
00:36:47,041 --> 00:36:49,125
Have some coffee.

532
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:51,000
Show me that hand.

533
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:52,125
Nice, right?

534
00:36:52,125 --> 00:36:52,750
Very nice!

535
00:36:52,875 --> 00:36:54,125
Actually, can I tell you all a joke?

536
00:36:54,125 --> 00:36:56,291
Kalyan, did you finish the work?

537
00:36:56,666 --> 00:36:57,875
Ta-da!

538
00:36:58,125 --> 00:36:59,000
What is this?

539
00:36:59,625 --> 00:37:00,541
Chill, dude!

540
00:37:00,625 --> 00:37:01,291
It’s just a bug.

541
00:37:01,375 --> 00:37:02,000
Look at this.

542
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,916
It will turn cherry red in an hour.

543
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,750
Cherry red, huh?
- Yes.

544
00:37:06,875 --> 00:37:07,750
Hey, son!

545
00:37:08,375 --> 00:37:09,875
Come and have lunch.

546
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:11,250
Come on.

547
00:37:16,791 --> 00:37:17,500
Sit down.

548
00:37:18,625 --> 00:37:19,875
It’s the flavors of Seema.

549
00:37:20,166 --> 00:37:22,750
Chicken broth and ragi malt.

550
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:26,250
Eat shamelessly. Have it..

551
00:37:26,791 --> 00:37:28,416
Take it.

552
00:37:43,875 --> 00:37:46,250
What do you guys do in the city?

553
00:37:46,625 --> 00:37:48,500
Umm… I’m a game designer.

554
00:37:48,625 --> 00:37:49,125
Huh?

555
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:50,375
Kalyan's a programmer.

556
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:52,041
He’s an animator.

557
00:37:52,916 --> 00:37:53,875
And she's a tester.

558
00:37:55,125 --> 00:37:56,625
What is he saying, dear?

559
00:37:56,916 --> 00:37:59,125
He designs games for kids, grandma.

560
00:38:00,625 --> 00:38:01,916
You’re all grown up.

561
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Why are you into kids’ games?

562
00:38:03,125 --> 00:38:04,541
Why don’t you get a real job?

563
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,500
Designing games is also a job.

564
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:08,500
That’s what Kalyan does in the city.

565
00:38:08,541 --> 00:38:10,791
Why would he need a job!

566
00:38:11,125 --> 00:38:13,250
He'll live a lavish life
once he moves into our house.

567
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:14,000
What!

568
00:38:15,916 --> 00:38:16,541
Where did he go?

569
00:38:16,625 --> 00:38:18,166
Pushkala…
- Hmm?

570
00:38:18,166 --> 00:38:20,541
Can I kiss you once?

571
00:38:20,541 --> 00:38:21,916
After the wedding.

572
00:38:23,291 --> 00:38:25,166
Can I touch you once?

573
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:26,500
After the wedding.

574
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:30,875
Can you at least get me some water?
- After the wedding.

575
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:33,625
Oh, really? You silly!

576
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,375
You idiot! Come with me.

577
00:38:41,125 --> 00:38:42,125
Fix the damn bug, man!

578
00:38:43,166 --> 00:38:44,125
Poor network.

579
00:38:44,375 --> 00:38:45,125
Where is it strong?

580
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,125
In Veera Reddy’s village.

581
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,375
Check properly.

582
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:54,500
Son-in-law, shall we go to the temple?

583
00:38:54,541 --> 00:38:55,750
Sure, uncle.
- Let’s go.

584
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:56,750
Hold this.

585
00:38:57,375 --> 00:38:59,500
You’re not getting married
until you fix the bug.

586
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,500
Remember that.
- We'll come back and fix it.

587
00:39:00,625 --> 00:39:02,125
Now let’s go. Come on!

588
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:04,500
What now?

589
00:39:05,875 --> 00:39:08,291
I need to go to the hospital, man.

590
00:39:08,375 --> 00:39:09,541
I’ll go back to Hyderabad.

591
00:39:09,666 --> 00:39:10,875
Do as you wish.

592
00:39:21,375 --> 00:39:23,625
Come Pushkala, Walk slowly.

593
00:39:35,166 --> 00:39:37,250
All those ladies are hitting on me.

594
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,166
Not really.

595
00:39:40,041 --> 00:39:42,500
Look how solid the groom looks.

596
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,750
Of course, me.

597
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:47,250
He is the sacrificial lamb
promised for 25 years

598
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:48,625
He has to be healthy.

599
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:49,666
Pushkala…

600
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:51,416
Hey, Pushkala.. Wait for me.

601
00:39:51,625 --> 00:39:53,500
It’s our first time. Let’s go together.

602
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:55,791
Hmm. Move.

603
00:39:58,375 --> 00:39:58,916
Hey, Kalyan!

604
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,750
Hmm, Friend, huh?

605
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:01,416
Yeah.

606
00:40:02,416 --> 00:40:04,000
He seems to be 5'7" tall.

607
00:40:04,791 --> 00:40:06,375
Call me once its done.

608
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,750
Coffins are made on order.

609
00:40:14,125 --> 00:40:14,625
Hey!

610
00:40:14,875 --> 00:40:15,625
Hey, Mario!

611
00:40:21,541 --> 00:40:23,250
Hey! Why're you always after her?

612
00:40:23,625 --> 00:40:25,541
If you like her so much, just tell me.
I’ll talk to uncle.

613
00:40:25,541 --> 00:40:27,125
Not in my worst nightmare!

614
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:29,041
Some guy gave me a card...

615
00:40:29,125 --> 00:40:30,916
Whatever, let’s go.
Everyone’s waiting.

616
00:40:37,416 --> 00:40:39,500
[singing randomly]

617
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:17,916
My madam is gold.

618
00:41:18,125 --> 00:41:20,250
It's my madam's gold!

619
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:22,541
[singing randomly]

620
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,500
Didn’t you leave for the city?

621
00:41:58,625 --> 00:42:02,500
I got greedy, please don’t tell the boss
I’m begging you.

622
00:42:05,166 --> 00:42:06,791
Here, Keep these anklets.

623
00:42:09,291 --> 00:42:10,500
Keep the earrings too.

624
00:42:12,041 --> 00:42:14,375
If you take everything,
I’ll have nothing left.

625
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,166
Greetings, sir.
- Greetings, priest.

626
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:25,500
Such a lovely couple!

627
00:42:27,875 --> 00:42:29,916
Perform prayer in the
name of bride and groom.

628
00:42:30,041 --> 00:42:30,625
Alright.

629
00:42:32,125 --> 00:42:33,125
She is..?

630
00:42:33,541 --> 00:42:34,916
Bukkareddy’s daughter.

631
00:42:35,166 --> 00:42:36,125
She’s here for the wedding.

632
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:37,000
That’s great!

633
00:42:37,291 --> 00:42:39,000
According to our custom…

634
00:42:39,041 --> 00:42:43,000
Let me narrate the
temple’s history to the couple.

635
00:42:43,291 --> 00:42:43,791
Hmm.

636
00:42:44,041 --> 00:42:47,125
In the Dwapara Age, when
Goddess Ganga was visiting Earth…

637
00:42:47,166 --> 00:42:49,875
it is said that she
entered a cave to rest.

638
00:42:49,875 --> 00:42:53,041
She saw the dazzling Shiva linga
that manifested inside the cave…

639
00:42:53,125 --> 00:42:54,500
and felt mesmerized.

640
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:57,250
Since then, she worships
the lord wholeheartedly…

641
00:42:57,375 --> 00:42:59,125
by residing in this cave right here.

642
00:42:59,875 --> 00:43:01,875
People who witnessed that wonder…

643
00:43:01,875 --> 00:43:04,750
believed that Lord Mrutyunjaya
has supernatural powers…

644
00:43:04,791 --> 00:43:07,000
and that the water from
Holy Ganges is like nectar.

645
00:43:07,041 --> 00:43:07,916
Hey, dad's calling.

646
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,375
Reddy dynasty found out about
the significance of this Shiva Linga…

647
00:43:10,375 --> 00:43:13,375
Built this temple in the 16th century…

648
00:43:13,375 --> 00:43:15,500
Thus bringing the lord closer to people.

649
00:43:15,541 --> 00:43:17,250
[chanting]

650
00:43:32,916 --> 00:43:36,250
Sir, present these silk
garments to the In-laws.

651
00:43:36,875 --> 00:43:39,125
Son, your parents..?

652
00:43:44,166 --> 00:43:45,625
Priest, the thing is…
- Give them to him.

653
00:43:45,666 --> 00:43:46,125
Hey!

654
00:43:49,125 --> 00:43:50,416
Hey, What is this?

655
00:43:50,541 --> 00:43:51,291
Don't do it!

656
00:43:51,416 --> 00:43:53,125
Calm down and listen to me.

657
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:55,125
He’s everything to me,
no matter how much we fight.

658
00:43:56,375 --> 00:43:56,875
Take it.

659
00:44:00,125 --> 00:44:01,000
Take it, dear.

660
00:44:01,625 --> 00:44:02,125
Take it.

661
00:44:02,125 --> 00:44:03,000
[chanting]

662
00:44:23,041 --> 00:44:23,500
Yes?

663
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:24,375
Where are you?

664
00:44:25,125 --> 00:44:27,041
I just turned into an adult.

665
00:44:27,166 --> 00:44:29,000
Shut up. Where the hell are you?

666
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:30,125
In a temple.

667
00:44:30,416 --> 00:44:31,625
Why are you there?

668
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:32,666
Kalyan is getting married.

669
00:44:32,875 --> 00:44:34,041
What?! Where?

670
00:44:34,291 --> 00:44:34,916
In Kurnool.

671
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:35,750
Kurnool?!

672
00:44:35,875 --> 00:44:36,541
Hmm.

673
00:44:36,625 --> 00:44:37,166
Hello?

674
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:39,000
Hello?

675
00:44:47,541 --> 00:44:49,000
Look, Veera Reddy…

676
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:39,250
Hey priest, How are the
arrangements coming?

677
00:45:39,291 --> 00:45:43,500
Thanks to you sir, The carnival
this year will be just as grand.

678
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:45,875
I’m talking about the
wedding at Bhuma Reddy’s.

679
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:49,750
Aren't you the one performing it.

680
00:45:50,416 --> 00:45:53,375
You shall perform his
son-in-law’s funeral as well.

681
00:45:58,625 --> 00:45:59,750
Oh, lord!

682
00:46:20,541 --> 00:46:22,125
[singing randomly]

683
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:23,250
Darshanam went on well, right dear?
Yeah.

684
00:46:23,750 --> 00:46:25,000
Hey! Come here.

685
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:26,125
Hey!

686
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:26,916
What?

687
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,750
Is it personal?
It’s okay, You can tell me.

688
00:46:29,791 --> 00:46:31,666
Listen to me carefully.

689
00:46:32,416 --> 00:46:34,250
Your father-in-law is
not as good as you think.

690
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,750
Veera Reddy and your father-in-law
are cold-blooded enemies.

691
00:46:36,791 --> 00:46:37,916
Chill, dude!

692
00:46:38,166 --> 00:46:40,125
If that was true,
uncle would’ve mentioned it.

693
00:46:40,125 --> 00:46:41,625
Let me finish talking.

694
00:46:42,041 --> 00:46:46,041
Veera Reddy has pledged to kill
the groom right after the wedding.

695
00:46:46,125 --> 00:46:48,625
Entire village knows it
including your in-laws.

696
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,125
Except you.

697
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:56,250
You’re making up stuff
‘cause I didn’t fix the bug.

698
00:46:56,541 --> 00:46:59,500
Didn't they say Veera
Reddy is a big time joker.

699
00:46:59,791 --> 00:47:01,291
He’s not the joker.

700
00:47:01,875 --> 00:47:02,416
You are.

701
00:47:02,541 --> 00:47:05,000
Everyone in this house
is making a fool out of you.

702
00:47:05,875 --> 00:47:07,625
[Singing] “I live here”

703
00:47:07,916 --> 00:47:09,666
“I die here”

704
00:47:10,041 --> 00:47:13,375
“Where else have I got to go?”

705
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:15,250
“I live here”

706
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:17,291
“I die here”

707
00:47:18,250 --> 00:47:20,791
“Where else have I got to go?”

708
00:47:20,875 --> 00:47:21,916
Stop, dude!

709
00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:24,750
“I live here.....I die here..”

710
00:47:25,041 --> 00:47:27,875
“Where else have I got to go?”

711
00:47:29,375 --> 00:47:31,041
The house is crowded with maids.

712
00:47:31,041 --> 00:47:33,250
But they’re all too busy
to get me some water.

713
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:34,750
Kanakam!

714
00:47:35,041 --> 00:47:35,791
Kanakam!

715
00:47:38,625 --> 00:47:40,000
Where is she going at this hour?

716
00:47:41,125 --> 00:47:42,250
Kanakam!

717
00:47:46,250 --> 00:47:48,500
I’m going to show you who’s boss
when you're back.

718
00:47:51,125 --> 00:47:52,375
What is she doing here?

719
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,375
Hey, Kanakam! Why are you here?

720
00:47:54,375 --> 00:47:56,125
Is your husband out of town?

721
00:47:56,166 --> 00:47:57,375
Come on. Let's fool around.

722
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:30,250
What’s wrong?

723
00:48:30,625 --> 00:48:32,666
Are you still thinking about Kalyan?

724
00:48:34,541 --> 00:48:36,666
Poor guy! He’s innocent.

725
00:48:37,875 --> 00:48:39,625
Despite knowing everything
we aren't able to help him.

726
00:48:40,041 --> 00:48:42,000
Veera Reddy will kill him
if this wedding proceeds.

727
00:48:42,625 --> 00:48:44,625
If we stop the wedding,
Bhuma Reddy will kill us.

728
00:48:44,750 --> 00:48:47,000
What if the wedding is called off?

729
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:48,375
How come?

730
00:48:51,166 --> 00:48:52,625
Let’s kidnap the priest.

731
00:48:52,666 --> 00:48:54,500
Bring the groom, people.

732
00:48:56,541 --> 00:48:57,750
Some other priest will
perform the ceremony.

733
00:48:57,875 --> 00:49:00,000
Let’s spill oil on the floor
and break Kalyan’s leg.

734
00:49:00,750 --> 00:49:02,500
“Yay! I’m getting married!”

735
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:05,125
“Yay! I’m getting…”

736
00:49:05,916 --> 00:49:08,125
Our plan is to save Kalyan.

737
00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:09,000
Not to kill him.

738
00:49:09,166 --> 00:49:10,291
What if we finish the old lady?

739
00:49:13,875 --> 00:49:16,750
Those video games messed your brain.

740
00:49:16,875 --> 00:49:18,291
What if we lie that Kalyan has an affair?

741
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:19,916
Who would believe it?

742
00:49:20,416 --> 00:49:21,625
What if we tore the wedding clothes?

743
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:22,750
Stole the holy thread.

744
00:49:22,875 --> 00:49:24,291
Drop a lizard in the wedding buffet.

745
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:26,250
Give me one idea that works.

746
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:28,125
Dance at his wedding tomorrow.

747
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:32,000
We’ll figure out what to do if
Veera Reddy really shows up.

748
00:49:32,125 --> 00:49:33,000
Now go to sleep.

749
00:50:47,916 --> 00:50:48,625
Caught her.

750
00:50:57,916 --> 00:50:59,250
Don’t scream. Don’t.

751
00:51:00,875 --> 00:51:03,000
Mario! What're you doing here?
- I didn’t do anything.

752
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:03,916
What happened?

753
00:51:04,541 --> 00:51:05,125
Uncle!

754
00:51:05,166 --> 00:51:06,291
Son..
- God!

755
00:51:06,291 --> 00:51:07,125
Is everything okay?

756
00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:08,750
Hey, Nandini!

757
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
What happened, dear?

758
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:11,625
Why did you scream?

759
00:51:12,291 --> 00:51:14,666
I came here to change clothes…

760
00:51:15,250 --> 00:51:18,000
and found this guy recording it.

761
00:51:22,625 --> 00:51:23,375
Hey, Kalyan!

762
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:25,375
Knife! Knife!

763
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:26,625
You heard that, uncle?

764
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:28,875
He’s calling me hot in front of you.

765
00:51:29,625 --> 00:51:32,375
Hey! How dare you
misbehave with our woman!

766
00:51:34,041 --> 00:51:35,666
Uncle! I apologize on his behalf.

767
00:51:35,875 --> 00:51:37,250
Please forgive him.
This won’t happen again.

768
00:51:37,250 --> 00:51:38,166
Son!
- Uncle.

769
00:51:38,375 --> 00:51:40,541
I’m holding back
‘cause he’s your friend.

770
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,916
If it were someone else,
his head would’ve been chopped off.

771
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:46,375
Let’s go!

772
00:51:47,125 --> 00:51:49,000
What just happened!

773
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,916
She’s framing me on purpose.

774
00:51:54,541 --> 00:51:55,625
What did you say?

775
00:51:56,250 --> 00:51:59,125
Apple fruit fell on Newton guy

776
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:01,166
But not the other way around.

777
00:52:01,750 --> 00:52:03,000
Are you screwing with me?

778
00:52:04,791 --> 00:52:06,375
You’re talking to Kasi Reddy.

779
00:52:07,125 --> 00:52:08,041
Did you get any of that?

780
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,166
Why did you do this?

781
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,500
You weren’t believing me.

782
00:52:12,541 --> 00:52:13,916
So I tried to shoot a video for proof.

783
00:52:14,250 --> 00:52:15,375
Are you worried about me?

784
00:52:15,375 --> 00:52:18,000
Or the fact that your game will
be hindered, if I settled down here?

785
00:52:18,125 --> 00:52:20,250
It’s always about your
life and your game.

786
00:52:20,875 --> 00:52:23,625
I gave you the status of my
family.

787
00:52:23,625 --> 00:52:25,625
But you humiliated
me in front of my in-laws.

788
00:52:26,375 --> 00:52:28,000
Here’s the code you needed.

789
00:52:28,125 --> 00:52:29,375
I finished it that day itself.

790
00:52:29,666 --> 00:52:32,500
Fearing you might leave once
you have it, I kept it from you.

791
00:52:32,666 --> 00:52:33,125
Here.

792
00:52:34,791 --> 00:52:35,291
It's all yours.

793
00:52:35,625 --> 00:52:36,291
You can leave now.

794
00:52:50,416 --> 00:52:52,166
Sir, at least have some buttermilk.

795
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:53,666
Ma’am will scold me otherwise.

796
00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:55,750
Keep it there and leave.

797
00:52:56,041 --> 00:52:56,750
Alright.

798
00:52:56,875 --> 00:52:58,375
I bought fireworks from Proddutooru.

799
00:52:58,375 --> 00:52:59,375
Just wait and watch.

800
00:52:59,416 --> 00:53:02,250
Masi Reddy is going
to blast the ears off.

801
00:53:05,375 --> 00:53:06,250
I’m leaving.

802
00:53:09,291 --> 00:53:10,625
I thought I’d let you know.

803
00:53:11,250 --> 00:53:13,916
I believed what the villagers
said and acted crazy.

804
00:53:14,916 --> 00:53:17,375
You were calling me a joker
and finally made me one.

805
00:53:18,125 --> 00:53:18,916
I’m sorry, man.

806
00:53:20,916 --> 00:53:22,125
Hey! Hold on.

807
00:53:23,125 --> 00:53:25,375
Why're you being a stuck-up,
when he's apologizing!

808
00:53:25,916 --> 00:53:28,250
He was just being
overprotective about you.

809
00:53:28,625 --> 00:53:30,000
Come on, Shake hands.

810
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:32,500
I’m not looking for an apology.

811
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:34,125
He couldn’t shut his
mouth since he got here.

812
00:53:34,125 --> 00:53:35,375
But he didn’t even
congratulate me on my wedding.

813
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Dude! Congrats!

814
00:53:38,875 --> 00:53:39,750
Thanks, man.

815
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:41,875
I was worried you’d get upset and leave.

816
00:53:41,875 --> 00:53:43,166
Come on guys, Group hug!

817
00:53:43,166 --> 00:53:44,541
So, you’re finally getting married.

818
00:53:44,916 --> 00:53:47,000
So is your wedding night on?

819
00:53:47,250 --> 00:53:48,041
Of course!

820
00:53:48,041 --> 00:53:49,791
I feel like pulling off your dhoti.

821
00:53:49,916 --> 00:53:50,916
I’ll pull it off.
- Hey! Don’t!

822
00:53:51,125 --> 00:53:52,000
Don’t! It’ll come off.

823
00:53:52,041 --> 00:53:53,541
Either this or your beard!
- I'm pulling it off!

824
00:53:54,375 --> 00:53:55,791
They are watching us, man! Don't!

825
00:53:55,875 --> 00:53:57,625
She's here
- What are you guys doing here?

826
00:53:57,666 --> 00:53:59,125
It’s time for the wedding.

827
00:53:59,250 --> 00:54:00,541
Uncle is calling you. Let’s go.

828
00:54:00,875 --> 00:54:02,875
Why are you wearing this for the wedding?

829
00:54:03,250 --> 00:54:04,041
Dress her up in a saree.

830
00:54:04,125 --> 00:54:04,875
Me and a Saree?

831
00:54:04,916 --> 00:54:05,625
Yeah.

832
00:54:05,625 --> 00:54:06,791
No!
- Come on, Maggie.

833
00:54:06,791 --> 00:54:08,625
Maggie, please wear
a saree for my wedding.

834
00:54:08,625 --> 00:54:09,916
You'll rock, Maggie. Come on!

835
00:54:09,916 --> 00:54:10,875
Catch her!

836
00:54:10,875 --> 00:54:12,291
Try this way.

837
00:54:12,541 --> 00:54:13,291
Go that way, Maggie.

838
00:54:13,541 --> 00:54:15,416
Okay. Don’t be late. Come fast.

839
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:16,791
Okay. Let’s go.

00:54:17,125 --> 00:54:19,125
Hey! Let’s drink and go.

841
00:54:19,166 --> 00:54:19,750
Hmm.

Why are you still here?

Uh-huh?

You think I stand back
while you guys fool my friend?

Mixing the pill isn't enough.

You should watch until he drinks it.

I’ll say the chants on her behalf.

00:59:16,125 --> 00:59:17,291
Naughty god!

911
00:59:18,916 --> 00:59:20,291
Pushkala…

912
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,500
I'm here..

913
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:26,791
Come. Come.

914
00:59:26,875 --> 00:59:28,416
Changing your voice isn't going to stop me.

915
00:59:28,750 --> 00:59:30,041
Kabaddi… Kabaddi…

916
00:59:43,791 --> 00:59:45,125
Watch out, man!

917
00:59:53,166 --> 00:59:54,625
On the right time.

918
00:59:58,375 --> 00:59:59,791
Guys, open the doors.

919
01:00:00,041 --> 01:00:02,541
Kalyan! Maggie! Where are you guys?

920
01:00:08,166 --> 01:00:09,000
Thanks, auntie.

921
01:00:11,250 --> 01:00:13,000
What's this weird sound!

922
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:21,625
Pushkala!

923
01:00:25,041 --> 01:00:26,666
I didn’t know you were so ready.

924
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,250
Wild, huh! I love it!

925
01:00:35,750 --> 01:00:37,291
Ouch!

926
01:00:54,375 --> 01:00:55,250
Hey Kalyan!

927
01:01:09,166 --> 01:01:10,000
What happened?

928
01:01:10,125 --> 01:01:11,750
They’re kidnapping Kalyan.

929
01:01:11,750 --> 01:01:13,875
Really? Who is it?

930
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:41,166
Come.

931
01:02:03,375 --> 01:02:05,250
Mario!
Come Mario!

932
01:02:05,291 --> 01:02:05,916
Come fast.

933
01:02:06,250 --> 01:02:07,375
Go.
- Come fast.

934
01:02:09,875 --> 01:02:10,500
Close!

935
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,166
Did you close all the doors?

936
01:02:13,166 --> 01:02:13,750
I did.

937
01:02:13,875 --> 01:02:15,166
What’s happening here?

938
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:21,875
Careful, bro!

939
01:02:27,125 --> 01:02:28,500
They’re biting each other.

940
01:02:28,625 --> 01:02:30,000
What’s gotten into them?

941
01:02:39,625 --> 01:02:40,625
Zombies!

942
01:03:25,875 --> 01:03:26,375
.

943
01:03:26,958 --> 01:03:27,166
Zombie?

944
01:03:28,458 --> 01:03:29,708
I’ve heard of the name Zambavati.

945
01:03:29,750 --> 01:03:30,958
But, who are these zombies?

946
01:03:31,375 --> 01:03:32,458
It’s a deadly virus.

947
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:33,625
Like Corona Virus?

948
01:03:34,083 --> 01:03:35,125
It’s much dangerous.

949
01:03:35,208 --> 01:03:36,833
First, you lose your mind.

950
01:03:37,333 --> 01:03:40,958
Then hunger makes
you crave human flesh.

951
01:03:41,333 --> 01:03:42,333
Are they monsters?

952
01:03:42,375 --> 01:03:43,708
More like living corpses.

953
01:03:43,958 --> 01:03:46,458
Hurt them all you want and
they wouldn’t feel a thing.

954
01:03:46,833 --> 01:03:48,625
They can't tell between
friends and enemies.

955
01:03:48,958 --> 01:03:51,333
They won’t stop until they
turn last of us into zombies.

956
01:03:51,333 --> 01:03:52,583
Whoa!

957
01:03:53,250 --> 01:03:58,750
I’d rather die than fall prey
to one of the zombie guys.

958
01:04:18,208 --> 01:04:19,583
Ah! Ah!

959
01:04:19,958 --> 01:04:21,958
Brother....

960
01:04:22,125 --> 01:04:23,875
He's biting bro...
- Ohh shit.

961
01:04:23,958 --> 01:04:25,583
I turned into a zombie!

962
01:04:49,833 --> 01:04:50,583
Look over there.

963
01:05:00,083 --> 01:05:03,500
You made up for all
these years of cleaning..

964
01:05:03,708 --> 01:05:04,958
You crooked teeth!

965
01:05:10,083 --> 01:05:13,958
You can't scare me anymore
without any teeth to infect.

966
01:05:14,083 --> 01:05:15,375
You’re so dead today!

967
01:05:17,708 --> 01:05:19,208
I was born to be a factionist.

968
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,458
You made me clean
your filthy dentures.

969
01:05:21,833 --> 01:05:23,333
My hands are meant to behead people..

970
01:05:23,708 --> 01:05:25,458
You made me do all lame shit.

971
01:05:26,750 --> 01:05:27,458
Just wait.

972
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:28,708
Make some space.

973
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:38,625
She won't die, man!

974
01:05:39,333 --> 01:05:40,125
Why not?

975
01:05:40,208 --> 01:05:41,208
Takes one solid shot.

976
01:05:49,208 --> 01:05:50,208
She's over!

977
01:05:53,250 --> 01:05:53,833
Mario! Mario!

978
01:06:00,625 --> 01:06:01,958
There you are, old zombie!

979
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:02,958
You did good.

980
01:06:05,375 --> 01:06:06,625
Now see.
- Hey! Hey!

981
01:06:06,875 --> 01:06:07,958
Why are you being a sadist!

982
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,708
You don’t know how much she tortured me.

983
01:06:09,833 --> 01:06:11,333
Run! Run!

984
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:12,333
Keep running!

985
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:14,083
Let’s go.

986
01:06:17,208 --> 01:06:19,708
Kalyan’s wedding is
going to get us all killed.

987
01:06:19,833 --> 01:06:22,250
Actually, Kalyan’s wedding
has brought death upon him only!

988
01:06:22,833 --> 01:06:24,333
Veera Reddy’s henchmen kidnapped him.

989
01:06:24,708 --> 01:06:25,375
What?!

990
01:06:26,333 --> 01:06:27,708
What if boss finds out…

991
01:06:28,208 --> 01:06:29,125
What do we do now?

992
01:06:30,208 --> 01:06:31,208
How do I tell him?

993
01:06:32,125 --> 01:06:33,125
This house can't hold longer.

994
01:06:33,208 --> 01:06:34,583
We need to get out ASAP.

995
01:06:35,125 --> 01:06:36,458
What do you know!

996
01:06:36,458 --> 01:06:38,333
This house has survived many bombings.

997
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:44,875
Whatever you say.

998
01:06:45,333 --> 01:06:46,333
My jeep is right outside.

999
01:06:46,458 --> 01:06:48,958
If we can make it till there, we’re safe.

1000
01:06:49,083 --> 01:06:50,333
But, how do we get there?

1001
01:06:50,750 --> 01:06:51,458
I have an idea.

1002
01:07:04,583 --> 01:07:06,083
We look exactly like zombies.

1003
01:07:06,458 --> 01:07:09,125
They wouldn’t recognize
us even if we’re amidst them.

1004
01:07:09,708 --> 01:07:10,375
Let’s go.

1005
01:07:19,458 --> 01:07:21,208
Holy shit! When did she became a zombie?

1006
01:07:21,375 --> 01:07:22,375
What the hell!

1007
01:07:22,833 --> 01:07:24,458
What do I tell her father now?

1008
01:07:27,333 --> 01:07:28,333
She’s coming this way.

1009
01:07:28,958 --> 01:07:32,083
Don't be scared. We're in make-up.
Safe!

1010
01:07:58,625 --> 01:07:59,583
Be careful, man.

1011
01:08:03,583 --> 01:08:04,708
Silence!

1012
01:08:10,958 --> 01:08:11,708
Hey…

1013
01:08:14,625 --> 01:08:16,375
They’re sensing us through smell.

1014
01:08:21,958 --> 01:08:22,833
Where’s the kitchen?

1015
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,833
What the hell man! Have you gone mad!
- What are you doing?

1016
01:08:27,833 --> 01:08:29,208
Death is not the
solution for everything.

1017
01:08:29,250 --> 01:08:30,333
Calm down!

1018
01:08:30,375 --> 01:08:31,458
I’ll go get the jeep.

1019
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:33,208
If the kerosene odor isn’t
strong enough, you’ll die.

1020
01:08:33,458 --> 01:08:35,083
Do you have a better idea?

1021
01:08:38,458 --> 01:08:40,500
No. Don’t do it.

1022
01:09:08,083 --> 01:09:09,500
[singing randomly]

1023
01:09:14,458 --> 01:09:15,708
We’re already home?

1024
01:09:15,750 --> 01:09:17,000
Yes.

1025
01:09:17,875 --> 01:09:19,000
Okay. See you tomorrow.

1026
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:28,583
The door is wide open.

1027
01:09:28,958 --> 01:09:31,208
Are you welcoming Veera Reddy or what?

1028
01:09:32,458 --> 01:09:34,833
[continues singing randomly]

1029
01:09:50,583 --> 01:09:51,500
Masi Reddy!

1030
01:09:56,083 --> 01:09:58,000
"I got the fire..."

1031
01:09:58,833 --> 01:10:01,625
"Fire in my mind."

1032
01:10:03,375 --> 01:10:05,708
"It Flames like a blue,"

1033
01:10:06,375 --> 01:10:08,875
"Burns like a sun..."

1034
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,083
"Time will change,"

1035
01:10:13,625 --> 01:10:16,708
"Color of your life."

1036
01:10:18,333 --> 01:10:21,208
"Waiting for the fire..."

1037
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:25,208
"Waiting for the fire.."

1038
01:10:25,833 --> 01:10:29,125
"To Burn down down down...."

1039
01:10:44,375 --> 01:10:46,833
Hey! That music’s blasting my ears.

1040
01:10:46,875 --> 01:10:48,125
Shut it down right now!

1041
01:10:48,583 --> 01:10:50,083
This man screwed everything up.

1042
01:11:16,250 --> 01:11:17,083
You go that side.

1043
01:11:18,875 --> 01:11:20,375
Poor thing!

1044
01:11:26,375 --> 01:11:27,083
Bro!

1045
01:11:32,375 --> 01:11:33,250
Who is he?

1046
01:11:33,333 --> 01:11:35,458
I guess he ate too much dal.

1047
01:11:35,458 --> 01:11:37,375
He’s snoring like hell.

1048
01:11:37,625 --> 01:11:38,333
Bro!

1049
01:11:55,333 --> 01:11:56,333
Who are you rascals?

1050
01:11:56,375 --> 01:11:57,708
Where are you taking me?

1051
01:11:57,750 --> 01:11:58,875
Who are you, man?

1052
01:11:58,958 --> 01:12:00,625
Stop the vehicle right now!

1053
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:02,625
Drive slow you idiot.

1054
01:12:11,583 --> 01:12:13,500
No stops till we reach Hyderabad.

1055
01:12:18,583 --> 01:12:20,250
Bro! Why did you take this turn?

1056
01:12:20,333 --> 01:12:21,375
It leads to Veera Reddy’s.

1057
01:12:22,958 --> 01:12:25,708
We’re not leaving Kalyan behind.

1058
01:12:38,833 --> 01:12:41,958
Maggie, stay here and
keep an eye on Masireddy.

1059
01:12:42,458 --> 01:12:43,458
Don’t let him create a ruckus.

1060
01:12:43,750 --> 01:12:44,333
Be careful.

1061
01:12:49,083 --> 01:12:50,208
Hey, Naari…
- Brother...

1062
01:12:50,250 --> 01:12:51,375
Look out!
Okay, brother.

1063
01:12:51,458 --> 01:12:51,958
Siddha!

1064
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:52,625
Be careful.

1065
01:12:52,708 --> 01:12:53,250
Okay.

1066
01:12:53,333 --> 01:12:54,833
Chandrudu, pass me a cigarette.

1067
01:12:55,875 --> 01:12:57,708
Suridu, did boss kill him?

1068
01:13:01,583 --> 01:13:04,458
If he did, we would be
celebrating already.

1069
01:13:07,083 --> 01:13:08,833
Boss is on his way as we speak.

1070
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:10,083
He will be dead anytime now.

1071
01:13:17,708 --> 01:13:19,708
Guys, feed the cattle.

1072
01:13:24,083 --> 01:13:25,208
I told you to look after him.

1073
01:13:26,583 --> 01:13:27,208
Stay alert.

1074
01:13:50,708 --> 01:13:54,583
Hey! You are acting like
you can beat them off!

1075
01:13:54,875 --> 01:13:57,250
If they catch us, it’ll be worse
than getting bitten by zombies.

1076
01:13:58,708 --> 01:14:00,750
I’ll go that way,
You go along with her.

1077
01:14:01,083 --> 01:14:04,208
Hello! I’ll go that way.
You go along with him.

1078
01:14:04,333 --> 01:14:06,083
Uff! Faction blood runs in her.

1079
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:07,958
She’s a tough one.

1080
01:14:07,958 --> 01:14:08,708
Let’s go.

1081
01:14:11,833 --> 01:14:13,375
Come on..

1082
01:14:23,833 --> 01:14:25,583
Where did they hide kalyan!

1083
01:14:31,958 --> 01:14:32,958
Careful.

1084
01:14:35,583 --> 01:14:36,708
What’s that for?

1085
01:14:36,708 --> 01:14:37,750
Idiot!

1086
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:39,708
Hush!

1087
01:14:47,750 --> 01:14:49,083
What was in those drinks?

1088
01:14:49,250 --> 01:14:52,500
My stomach got upset.

1089
01:15:07,208 --> 01:15:09,000
People call him ‘Single Arm’ Reddy.

1090
01:15:09,458 --> 01:15:13,000
My dad chopped off his arm.

1091
01:15:14,250 --> 01:15:16,458
What’s with you people and chopping arms?
Let’s go.

1092
01:15:16,583 --> 01:15:18,708
I will chop off his other arm.

1093
01:15:18,750 --> 01:15:19,708
Shut up and move.

1094
01:15:29,583 --> 01:15:30,125
That way.

1095
01:15:40,958 --> 01:15:41,708
Who is he?

1096
01:15:42,708 --> 01:15:44,125
Kondareddy..

1097
01:15:48,250 --> 01:15:49,208
Stay calm.

1098
01:16:09,875 --> 01:16:11,000
Kill him, boss!

1099
01:16:11,583 --> 01:16:13,833
His head should land
at Bhuma Reddy’s door.

1100
01:16:13,958 --> 01:16:16,958
His boiling blood should
wash off father’s feet.

1101
01:16:17,458 --> 01:16:19,958
Hey! Bring father here.
- Okay, boss.

1102
01:16:26,083 --> 01:16:27,083
He’s coming this way.

1103
01:16:27,083 --> 01:16:28,208
We’re screwed.

1104
01:16:30,083 --> 01:16:30,958
Be quiet, man.

1105
01:16:38,708 --> 01:16:39,583
Where's the old man?

1106
01:16:41,333 --> 01:16:42,000
Boss!

1107
01:16:42,875 --> 01:16:43,458
Boss!

1108
01:16:43,750 --> 01:16:44,958
I can’t find your father.

1109
01:16:44,958 --> 01:16:47,500
Have you gone blind?
Where would he go?

1110
01:16:53,750 --> 01:16:55,083
I searched the entire house, boss.

1111
01:16:55,083 --> 01:16:55,583
Huh?

1112
01:16:55,958 --> 01:16:56,958
Where did he go?

1113
01:17:03,333 --> 01:17:04,500
You rascal!

1114
01:17:04,583 --> 01:17:06,583
I would’ve chopped off your head
if I had my arms.

1115
01:17:07,458 --> 01:17:07,958
Hey!

1116
01:17:16,833 --> 01:17:18,458
Idiot! Can't you check properly?

1117
01:17:18,833 --> 01:17:19,500
Father!

1118
01:17:24,833 --> 01:17:26,958
Father, I didn’t kill him yet.

1119
01:17:26,958 --> 01:17:28,083
I’ll do it with you watching.

1120
01:17:28,125 --> 01:17:28,958
Shut up.

1121
01:17:28,958 --> 01:17:29,458
.

1122
01:17:33,125 --> 01:17:34,958
Who’s going to come and save you?

1123
01:17:38,708 --> 01:17:40,208
Hey, Mario! It’s you?

1124
01:17:40,458 --> 01:17:41,458
Hey!

1125
01:17:47,833 --> 01:17:49,750
Sorry man, I didn't believe you!

1126
01:17:50,625 --> 01:17:51,458
Let’s go.

1127
01:17:54,625 --> 01:17:55,458
Nandini!

1128
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:11,458
Who are you, dear?

1129
01:18:11,708 --> 01:18:12,958
Brother kasireddy, it’s me.

1130
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:14,833
Nandini Reddy. Bukka Reddy’s daughter.

1131
01:18:17,708 --> 01:18:19,083
I was on my way to Pushkala’s wedding…

1132
01:18:19,125 --> 01:18:20,250
When they tied me up here.

1133
01:18:21,333 --> 01:18:23,083
If you’re Nandini, Then..?

1134
01:18:47,333 --> 01:18:49,458
Why do you guys look flushed?

1135
01:18:49,583 --> 01:18:50,708
Who do you think she is?

1136
01:18:50,833 --> 01:18:53,833
It’s my daughter who carries
my blood and vengeance in her.

1137
01:18:53,958 --> 01:18:54,958
Sailaja Reddy.

1138
01:19:14,375 --> 01:19:16,625
We thought we were in the dark till now.

1139
01:19:17,583 --> 01:19:19,583
But in fact,
we were all a part of your sketch.

1140
01:19:20,583 --> 01:19:22,708
Thanks for dropping me home.

1141
01:19:23,708 --> 01:19:27,583
You couldn’t even stop a wedding

1142
01:19:27,750 --> 01:19:29,250
You think you could save
someone from death?

1143
01:19:30,125 --> 01:19:31,583
25 years of vengeance, damn it!

1144
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:32,375
Hey! Stop it!

1145
01:19:33,708 --> 01:19:36,250
Bhuma Reddy’s village
is turning into a graveyard.

1146
01:19:37,333 --> 01:19:38,250
You know about it.

1147
01:19:38,458 --> 01:19:39,458
Why don’t you say something?

1148
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,375
Just ‘cause death is upon us…

1149
01:19:41,583 --> 01:19:43,875
How can we let the enemy go.

1150
01:19:45,333 --> 01:19:46,583
Have you gone crazy?

1151
01:19:46,833 --> 01:19:48,333
You couldn’t care less
about the current situation.

1152
01:19:48,375 --> 01:19:51,625
You’re more worried about seeking
revenge for what happened 25 years ago.

1153
01:19:51,625 --> 01:19:53,125
You call yourselves human?
- Hey!

1154
01:19:53,333 --> 01:19:53,750
You!

1155
01:19:58,375 --> 01:20:01,583
How can we recall it, when we hadn’t
forgotten about it for a second.

1156
01:20:01,625 --> 01:20:02,250
Look!

1157
01:20:04,375 --> 01:20:07,708
My sister was supposed to be
married into Bhuma Reddy’s family.

1158
01:20:08,208 --> 01:20:10,375
Now she is left in the dark, retarded.

1159
01:20:10,875 --> 01:20:12,208
Is it the time for the wedding?

1160
01:20:14,375 --> 01:20:15,333
Give me 2 minutes.

1161
01:20:15,375 --> 01:20:16,958
You'll see your sister as a bride.

1162
01:20:21,500 --> 01:20:22,333
Did you hear that?

1163
01:20:23,083 --> 01:20:26,750
My sister’s life got stuck in
that moment from 25 years ago.

1164
01:20:26,958 --> 01:20:28,375
How can I move on with my life?

1165
01:20:30,625 --> 01:20:31,458
I’m coming.

1166
01:20:32,125 --> 01:20:34,500
Does it look good? Huh?

1167
01:20:36,208 --> 01:20:42,500
Bhuma Reddy’s brother left my aunt
at the altar for someone else.

1168
01:20:42,833 --> 01:20:45,708
Since then, aunt has lived in
the dark, obsessing over him.

1169
01:20:47,250 --> 01:20:48,750
Oh, Pratap!

1170
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:53,000
We went crazy in 3 months of lockdown.

1171
01:20:53,208 --> 01:20:54,583
She’s been that way since 25 years.

1172
01:20:54,750 --> 01:20:56,083
She is bound to go crazy.

1173
01:20:56,958 --> 01:20:59,625
She was supposed to
have a happy married life.

1174
01:20:59,958 --> 01:21:01,958
But seeing her grieving
like a widow everyday..

1175
01:21:02,333 --> 01:21:04,833
I want Bhuma Reddy to
know how that feels like.

1176
01:21:05,250 --> 01:21:06,125
That is why we’re killing him.

1177
01:21:06,125 --> 01:21:06,833
Hey!

1178
01:21:08,333 --> 01:21:09,625
Do something, man.

1179
01:21:10,208 --> 01:21:10,750
True.

1180
01:21:11,375 --> 01:21:12,583
You should get your revenge.

1181
01:21:13,875 --> 01:21:15,458
But not by killing this fool.

1182
01:21:16,083 --> 01:21:17,833
The guy who created rift b/w two families…

1183
01:21:17,833 --> 01:21:19,125
and separated two villages..

1184
01:21:19,208 --> 01:21:20,333
That.. Bhuma Reddy’s brother.

1185
01:21:21,083 --> 01:21:21,958
That rascal!

1186
01:21:22,083 --> 01:21:23,833
He should be brought before you and killed.

1187
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:24,625
Hey!

1188
01:21:25,250 --> 01:21:26,875
Tell me, Tell me who he is.

1189
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,208
I’ll find him no matter
where he’s hiding…

1190
01:21:29,333 --> 01:21:30,708
and kill him in front of you sir.

1191
01:21:32,458 --> 01:21:33,000
That’s him.

1192
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:35,583
Pratap!

1193
01:21:39,458 --> 01:21:41,958
Our deeds should be awe-inspiring!

1194
01:21:42,083 --> 01:21:42,708
Awe!

1195
01:21:47,208 --> 01:21:49,125
Hey, Mario. It’s your dad.

1196
01:21:49,208 --> 01:21:50,250
Oh, damn!

1197
01:21:53,458 --> 01:21:54,375
Shut up man!

1198
01:21:54,583 --> 01:21:55,875
You’re Pratap Reddy’s son?

1199
01:21:57,083 --> 01:21:57,958
Move. Move.

1200
01:22:08,125 --> 01:22:09,250
Same eyes.

1201
01:22:11,708 --> 01:22:12,875
Same nose.

1202
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:15,208
Our junior boss.

1203
01:22:15,708 --> 01:22:18,000
Rudravaram’s heir.

1204
01:22:19,625 --> 01:22:21,208
Now this is luck.

1205
01:22:21,833 --> 01:22:24,000
I wanted to kill
Bhuma Reddy’s son-in-law.

1206
01:22:24,583 --> 01:22:27,333
But I’ve hit the jackpot by
trapping Pratap Reddy’s son.

1207
01:22:28,583 --> 01:22:29,750
Kill him, dad.

1208
01:22:32,375 --> 01:22:33,583
Hey!!!

1209
01:22:38,875 --> 01:22:39,625
Father!

1210
01:22:41,875 --> 01:22:43,708
Father! You’re walking?!

1211
01:22:43,750 --> 01:22:46,000
Sailaja! Grandpa is walking again.

1212
01:22:46,083 --> 01:22:47,958
He came here by himself!

1213
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,125
Father! Father!

1214
01:22:51,708 --> 01:22:54,833
Hey… Looks like your grandpa
has just turned into a zombie.

1215
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:57,000
Go and save your dad immediately.

1216
01:22:57,083 --> 01:22:58,000
Dad!
- Dad!

1217
01:22:58,333 --> 01:22:59,083
Dad!

1218
01:23:00,875 --> 01:23:02,375
Yay! I’m getting married!

1219
01:23:03,250 --> 01:23:04,583
Whoo-hoo! I’m getting married.

1220
01:23:04,708 --> 01:23:06,458
Hey, Talambari!

1221
01:23:06,458 --> 01:23:08,333
Don’t hurt my sister.

1222
01:23:08,375 --> 01:23:10,083
If you take one step ahead…

1223
01:23:10,083 --> 01:23:11,500
I’m going to chop off Talambari’s head.

1224
01:23:11,583 --> 01:23:12,708
Hey!

1225
01:23:12,750 --> 01:23:13,500
Chinna!

1226
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:15,250
Now you seem like you belong here.

1227
01:23:15,333 --> 01:23:18,208
Chinna! show our sign of
vigour by smacking your thigh.

1228
01:23:18,333 --> 01:23:19,625
You haven’t done it in so long.

1229
01:23:19,708 --> 01:23:21,083
Smack your thigh, Chinna.

1230
01:23:21,125 --> 01:23:23,958
Smack your thigh, Chinna.
- Smack your thigh, Chinna.

1231
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,625
Come on!

1232
01:23:25,875 --> 01:23:28,500
Smack your thigh, Chinna.
- Hey.

1233
01:23:29,708 --> 01:23:32,000
What’s going on here?
What are you doing?

1234
01:23:32,333 --> 01:23:33,208
You can do it later then.

1235
01:23:33,708 --> 01:23:35,958
Are you taking me to Pratap Reddy?

1236
01:23:36,083 --> 01:23:36,750
Yes.

1237
01:23:36,833 --> 01:23:38,208
Let’s go. Quick.

1238
01:23:38,250 --> 01:23:39,083
Let go!
Let’s go.

1239
01:23:39,125 --> 01:23:41,708
Hold on. I’m going to Pratap Reddy.
- Move...

1240
01:23:41,750 --> 01:23:43,583
Hey!
- I’m going to chop off Talambari’s head.

1241
01:23:43,583 --> 01:23:44,583
Hey!

1242
01:23:44,708 --> 01:23:45,625
Let's go!

1243
01:23:46,333 --> 01:23:47,000
Hey!

1244
01:23:48,458 --> 01:23:49,708
Hey!
Brother!

1245
01:23:49,958 --> 01:23:51,583
Move it man.
It's my wedding brother!

1246
01:23:53,333 --> 01:23:54,708
I’m going to my man.

1247
01:23:55,833 --> 01:23:57,333
Come over here.
Stop. Stop.

1248
01:23:57,583 --> 01:24:00,583
Where’s Pratap?
- Over there. Look. Look.

1249
01:24:00,583 --> 01:24:04,875
Where are you, Pratap? I’m coming.

1250
01:24:04,875 --> 01:24:07,583
Hurry up.. Let's go
-Hey!

1251
01:24:07,625 --> 01:24:10,458
We’re going to step in the house
only after that rascal is dead.

1252
01:24:10,500 --> 01:24:11,708
Start the vehicle.

1253
01:24:15,583 --> 01:24:17,208
Get the boss as well.

1254
01:24:19,125 --> 01:24:20,750
Hey!..Stop!

1255
01:24:21,833 --> 01:24:22,500
Drive.

1256
01:24:27,083 --> 01:24:28,750
Why is the old man looking weird?

1257
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:33,333
Hey!

1258
01:24:34,458 --> 01:24:35,125
Stop!

1259
01:24:35,333 --> 01:24:35,875
Hey!

1260
01:24:35,958 --> 01:24:36,583
Stop!

1261
01:24:38,958 --> 01:24:40,083
Hey! Stop you rascal!

1262
01:24:41,333 --> 01:24:42,458
Stop right there!

1263
01:24:47,875 --> 01:24:49,583
Hey, Kasi Reddy!

1264
01:24:50,208 --> 01:24:54,208
I killed Veera Reddy pretty
badly in my dream last night.

1265
01:24:54,333 --> 01:24:55,333
He’s our enemy!

1266
01:25:00,833 --> 01:25:01,708
Let's escape.

1267
01:25:12,958 --> 01:25:15,958
We should kill them before
they enter Bhuma Reddy’s village.

1268
01:25:16,083 --> 01:25:17,583
That’s not where they’re heading, dad.

1269
01:25:17,833 --> 01:25:18,708
They’re going to Hyderabad.

1270
01:25:21,083 --> 01:25:23,083
Zombies have completely
taken over Rudravaram.

1271
01:25:23,208 --> 01:25:25,083
Zombies?! What are they?

1272
01:25:28,708 --> 01:25:29,875
Stop. Stop. That’s the car.

1273
01:25:30,375 --> 01:25:31,583
Hey! Get down.

1274
01:26:03,125 --> 01:26:04,125
Hey Mario.
Police!

1275
01:26:05,250 --> 01:26:06,208
Come fast.

1276
01:26:09,458 --> 01:26:11,208
Sir, somebody’s trying to kill us.

1277
01:26:11,333 --> 01:26:13,125
Sir! Somebody’s trying to…

1278
01:26:21,458 --> 01:26:23,208
Gandhari, what’s going on?

1279
01:26:24,333 --> 01:26:26,333
Draupadi is pulling Dushshasan’s garment.

1280
01:26:26,458 --> 01:26:27,083
What is this?

1281
01:26:27,125 --> 01:26:28,750
Why are you pulling off his clothes,
instead of him pulling yours.

1282
01:26:30,625 --> 01:26:31,583
Zombie!

1283
01:26:34,208 --> 01:26:35,875
Oh, shit! Draupadi is possessed.

1284
01:26:35,958 --> 01:26:38,208
Run, everyone! Run!

1285
01:26:46,333 --> 01:26:47,583
They’re here too?

1286
01:26:54,333 --> 01:26:55,083
Zombie!

1287
01:26:56,583 --> 01:26:57,500
Let’s get out of here.

1288
01:27:09,708 --> 01:27:11,208
Is this your son?
- Yes.

1289
01:27:11,333 --> 01:27:12,083
Be careful.

1290
01:27:13,208 --> 01:27:14,333
Go that way.
That way.

1291
01:27:16,833 --> 01:27:17,583
Hey!

1292
01:27:18,500 --> 01:27:20,833
Veera Reddy…
- Dad…

1293
01:27:20,833 --> 01:27:21,833
Come this way.

1294
01:27:22,208 --> 01:27:23,583
Sailaja…
- Dad…

1295
01:27:24,208 --> 01:27:25,583
Sailaja…
- Dad!

1296
01:27:31,208 --> 01:27:31,958
Pushkala…!

1297
01:27:35,708 --> 01:27:36,375
Pushkala…

1298
01:27:36,458 --> 01:27:37,208
Pushkala…!

1299
01:27:38,083 --> 01:27:39,708
Pushkala!

1300
01:27:47,458 --> 01:27:48,708
Hey!

1301
01:27:49,208 --> 01:27:50,625
Hey!

1302
01:27:51,333 --> 01:27:52,458
Hey!

1303
01:27:55,458 --> 01:27:58,208
Listen… They don't seem like screaming..

1304
01:27:58,208 --> 01:27:59,583
It’s more like they’re in pain.

1305
01:28:11,458 --> 01:28:13,750
Brother!
- Oh God!

1306
01:28:32,375 --> 01:28:33,375
Oh, damn!

1307
01:28:33,458 --> 01:28:34,458
Let’s go.

1308
01:28:46,083 --> 01:28:46,750
Dad…

1309
01:28:48,750 --> 01:28:49,500
Dad!

1310
01:28:51,083 --> 01:28:52,083
Dad…!

1311
01:28:53,458 --> 01:28:55,000
Dad…!

1312
01:31:47,833 --> 01:31:49,250
Hey...

1313
01:32:36,083 --> 01:32:37,458
Idiot! Watch out.

1314
01:32:37,583 --> 01:32:38,500
Oops!

1315
01:34:20,333 --> 01:34:22,375
Ah, there you are.

1316
01:34:33,833 --> 01:34:34,833
Come up. Come on.

1317
01:34:37,833 --> 01:34:38,833
Come...Come.

1318
01:34:39,875 --> 01:34:40,875
Head is broken.

1319
01:35:14,375 --> 01:35:15,458
Bhadram…

1320
01:35:25,583 --> 01:35:26,458
Shoot!

1321
01:35:47,125 --> 01:35:48,208
Give it to me.

1322
01:35:49,125 --> 01:35:49,958
I wrap your hand.

1323
01:35:50,708 --> 01:35:51,958
Nothing will happen,right?

1324
01:36:13,083 --> 01:36:13,708
Bhadram…

1325
01:36:17,083 --> 01:36:18,375
Mario!

1326
01:36:18,500 --> 01:36:19,125
Maggie!

1327
01:36:19,750 --> 01:36:20,458
Maggie!

1328
01:36:21,708 --> 01:36:22,833
Hey
- Mario!

1329
01:36:23,833 --> 01:36:25,083
Mario! No!
- Maggie!

1330
01:36:25,250 --> 01:36:26,458
Maggie!
- No! No!

1331
01:36:26,833 --> 01:36:28,583
But it’s Maggie!
- Mario! No! No!

1332
01:36:29,250 --> 01:36:31,333
No! No! No!
- Maggie!

1333
01:36:31,708 --> 01:36:33,208
No..
- Maggie!

1334
01:36:33,875 --> 01:36:34,625
Mario!

1335
01:36:34,708 --> 01:36:37,208
Listen to me. Just listen to me, Mario.

1336
01:36:37,250 --> 01:36:37,958
Come on!

1337
01:36:38,333 --> 01:36:39,833
No! Let’s go!

1338
01:36:53,083 --> 01:36:54,208
Yeah, that’s right.

1339
01:36:59,833 --> 01:37:00,583
Hey!

1340
01:37:01,083 --> 01:37:01,583
Hey!

1341
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:27,208
Mario!

1342
01:37:30,708 --> 01:37:31,625
Sorry, man!

1343
01:37:32,250 --> 01:37:34,208
I'm responsible for Bhadram,
Maggie and all of this.

1344
01:37:34,750 --> 01:37:38,250
I should've come along to
Hyderabad when you insisted.

1345
01:37:38,875 --> 01:37:39,333
Damn!

1346
01:37:39,333 --> 01:37:42,000
I need to go to the hospital.
I'll leave for Hyderabad.

1347
01:37:43,583 --> 01:37:46,375
This wouldn't have happened
if it weren't for my wedding.

1348
01:37:48,750 --> 01:37:49,333
Oh shit.

1349
01:37:59,125 --> 01:38:00,958
Looks like they will chase us everywhere.

1350
01:38:02,458 --> 01:38:04,708
It won't take long to spread
to the surrounding areas.

1351
01:38:15,083 --> 01:38:16,083
Why are we here?

1352
01:38:24,333 --> 01:38:25,875
He escaped.

1353
01:38:26,583 --> 01:38:27,125
Mario!

1354
01:38:43,250 --> 01:38:44,583
Where are you taking us?

1355
01:38:46,125 --> 01:38:46,875
Come. I'll tell you.

1356
01:38:48,750 --> 01:38:49,458
Hey!

1357
01:40:00,833 --> 01:40:01,375
Hey!

1358
01:40:05,958 --> 01:40:07,583
Hey, who are you?

1359
01:40:08,083 --> 01:40:08,875
What are you doing here?

1360
01:40:08,958 --> 01:40:11,000
You idiot! What have you done to him?

1361
01:40:11,083 --> 01:40:12,583
What exactly are you doing here?

1362
01:40:12,708 --> 01:40:13,458
He'll die, man.

1363
01:40:13,583 --> 01:40:16,125
That guy bit Bhadram
and started all of this.

1364
01:40:16,125 --> 01:40:17,875
Two villages got ruined because of him.

1365
01:40:18,083 --> 01:40:19,083
Say what've you done.

1366
01:40:19,125 --> 01:40:21,208
Tell the truth. What do you know?

1367
01:40:21,333 --> 01:40:23,583
Tell me, old man!
Or else I'll break your head.

1368
01:40:27,208 --> 01:40:29,708
What have you done? Tell me!

1369
01:40:29,833 --> 01:40:32,458
It's an accident. Just an accident!

1370
01:40:32,750 --> 01:40:35,208
Accident?
-Yeah, cool!

1371
01:40:36,208 --> 01:40:39,083
I was a world famous virologist.

1372
01:40:39,333 --> 01:40:43,125
Government banned me
saying my practices were wrong.

1373
01:40:44,250 --> 01:40:49,708
If I invent the first vaccine for Corona,

1374
01:40:49,708 --> 01:40:55,000
Everyone would be back at my feet.

1375
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:56,708
For Corona?

1376
01:40:56,708 --> 01:41:02,208
Instead of wasting time on animals,
I experimented on humans directly.

1377
01:41:10,333 --> 01:41:12,333
He is a failed experiment.

1378
01:41:13,208 --> 01:41:17,083
The vaccine I invented
developed a new virus in him.

1379
01:41:17,208 --> 01:41:19,833
You did all this?
- Yes, me! It's me.

1380
01:41:20,625 --> 01:41:22,958
We should feed you to zombie first.
-No, no!

1381
01:41:23,833 --> 01:41:26,375
I cracked it now, I cracked it.

1382
01:41:28,083 --> 01:41:30,875
The world would soon know who I am.

1383
01:41:31,083 --> 01:41:35,208
Medicine to cure him, Corona
or anything else in the future.

1384
01:41:35,958 --> 01:41:40,583
Everybody will worship me.
They'll become my servants.

1385
01:41:40,833 --> 01:41:44,500
I'll be God. Yeah, G-O-D!

1386
01:41:45,125 --> 01:41:46,875
This has a cure? Say, man.

1387
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,708
I won't, man!
- Say it idiot, come on.. say it.

1388
01:41:49,750 --> 01:41:50,875
Where is it?

1389
01:41:51,375 --> 01:41:53,333
I'll stab you rascal, Tell me. Where is it?

1390
01:42:12,875 --> 01:42:13,458
Mario!

1391
01:42:14,875 --> 01:42:15,333
Hey!

1392
01:42:15,708 --> 01:42:16,958
Do something and control him.

1393
01:42:17,208 --> 01:42:21,625
No! He became a
monster. No one can control him.

1394
01:42:51,083 --> 01:42:51,625
Come..

1395
01:43:07,583 --> 01:43:08,833
No...

1396
01:43:40,875 --> 01:43:41,500
Hey...

1397
01:44:00,750 --> 01:44:01,458
Uncle!

1398
01:44:01,750 --> 01:44:02,458
Move on.

1399
01:44:11,708 --> 01:44:15,750
Lively village has
turned into a graveyard now.

1400
01:44:17,208 --> 01:44:19,333
My own people came upon me!

1401
01:44:20,875 --> 01:44:22,833
Even my wife and daughter are missing.

1402
01:44:24,083 --> 01:44:25,500
That means even they…

1403
01:44:29,208 --> 01:44:30,583
That scientist is responsible for all this.

1404
01:44:31,083 --> 01:44:33,208
He died without saying where the cure is.

1405
01:44:33,458 --> 01:44:33,958
Damn!

1406
01:44:35,375 --> 01:44:36,875
Is there no other way out?

1407
01:44:43,250 --> 01:44:46,833
I found it. It's my first
vaccine experiment.

1408
01:44:49,708 --> 01:44:51,458
Yeah. Come on! come on!

1409
01:44:52,083 --> 01:44:53,208
Oh damn! It's a failure.

1410
01:44:57,708 --> 01:44:58,583
Shit!

1411
01:45:03,583 --> 01:45:04,208
Hey...

1412
01:45:06,958 --> 01:45:07,583
Oh no!

1413
01:45:14,583 --> 01:45:16,333
This is it! This is it!

1414
01:45:16,458 --> 01:45:17,583
Hey, no!

1415
01:45:17,833 --> 01:45:19,208
Did you find anything?

1416
01:46:22,583 --> 01:46:24,083
Come on, come fast.

1417
01:46:33,875 --> 01:46:34,833
Come!

1418
01:46:36,125 --> 01:46:36,833
Come on!

1419
01:46:37,083 --> 01:46:37,750
No!

1420
01:46:49,208 --> 01:46:50,083
Come with me.

1421
01:46:58,583 --> 01:47:00,083
Have you gone mad?
Didn't I refuse!

1422
01:47:00,333 --> 01:47:01,708
Why did you bring us here?

1423
01:47:01,958 --> 01:47:04,833
The only solution for this
problem is in this temple.

1424
01:47:09,583 --> 01:47:11,458
Yes, I found it.

1425
01:47:11,625 --> 01:47:12,958
Virus can be cured.

1426
01:47:13,083 --> 01:47:15,000
Zombie disease can be cured.

1427
01:47:15,750 --> 01:47:18,000
This is it! This is it! Yeah!

1428
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:21,375
But, he didn't say where it is.

1429
01:47:21,458 --> 01:47:22,958
How can we know what
it is, in such a big temple?

1430
01:47:25,958 --> 01:47:27,250
This is it! This is it!

1431
01:47:29,958 --> 01:47:32,500
If we find this symbol,
we've our cure for the virus!

1432
01:47:33,333 --> 01:47:34,708
All of you, search for this symbol.

1433
01:47:35,458 --> 01:47:36,250
Fast!

1434
01:48:05,625 --> 01:48:06,333
Dad!

1435
01:48:09,375 --> 01:48:11,583
You're fine, right dad?
-I'm fine, dear.

1436
01:48:15,375 --> 01:48:17,083
Hey, we need to be moving.

1437
01:48:17,208 --> 01:48:18,083
Let's go.
- Stop!

1438
01:48:20,208 --> 01:48:21,958
How could you plot behind my back!

1439
01:48:22,458 --> 01:48:24,583
Hadn't you done the same!

1440
01:48:25,125 --> 01:48:28,083
Fearing I might kill your brother,
if he ever enters the village

1441
01:48:28,583 --> 01:48:31,833
Didn't you silently bring
in his son for the wedding?

1442
01:48:31,958 --> 01:48:33,583
Damn it! You're a disgrace to the region.

1443
01:48:34,500 --> 01:48:35,750
Are you Pratap's son?

1444
01:48:38,375 --> 01:48:39,500
Where is your father?

1445
01:48:40,833 --> 01:48:45,833
He left a girl at the altar for his
pleasure and sabotaged my prestige.

1446
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,458
I'd kill him myself if I ever see him.

1447
01:48:52,500 --> 01:48:55,000
Fine. What my dad did was wrong.

1448
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:57,208
How are you any different?

1449
01:48:58,500 --> 01:49:01,083
You hid the truth and got
kalyan married to your daughter.

1450
01:49:01,833 --> 01:49:02,833
Is that not cheating?

1451
01:49:04,208 --> 01:49:05,583
You need revenge, huh?

1452
01:49:05,833 --> 01:49:08,375
You need revenge when your
daughter is on the deathbed?

1453
01:49:08,458 --> 01:49:09,958
What's wrong, dear?

1454
01:49:10,708 --> 01:49:12,083
Sattireddy!
- Dad!

1455
01:49:18,208 --> 01:49:19,000
Get up!

1456
01:49:35,333 --> 01:49:37,250
You go and search. We'll handle it.

1457
01:49:37,375 --> 01:49:38,250
Careful, dear.

1458
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,083
Mario!...

1459
01:50:02,833 --> 01:50:04,208
Hey!

1460
01:50:33,125 --> 01:50:38,750
"Om, we worship the three-eyed One,"

1461
01:50:40,333 --> 01:50:43,833
"Who is fragrant and who nourishes all"

1462
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:49,333
"Like the fruit falls off from
the bondage of the stem,"

1463
01:50:51,500 --> 01:50:56,458
"May we be liberated
from death, from mortality"

1464
01:51:01,708 --> 01:51:07,708
"A persona symbolizing destruction
A catastrophe ensues"

1465
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:13,708
"Doomsday is here, filling
the place with cries for help"

1466
01:51:13,875 --> 01:51:17,000
"A disaster has left the place in ruins"

1467
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:20,125
"A holocaust shattering lives"

1468
01:51:20,458 --> 01:51:26,208
"Times of terror make your heart tremble"

1469
01:51:26,708 --> 01:51:30,083
"In the times of annihilation"

1470
01:53:11,833 --> 01:53:22,083
"Hey Lord, let lose the
heavenly Ganges from your hair."

1471
01:53:23,083 --> 01:53:31,333
"The sacred nectar that
cures all the diseases and sins"

1472
01:53:33,333 --> 01:53:37,583
"With this brimming holy water"

1473
01:53:38,625 --> 01:53:41,958
"Let our sins be erased"

1474
01:53:42,083 --> 01:53:45,583
"Let our curses be lifted"

1475
01:53:46,250 --> 01:53:52,833
"End this danger and bring
the conditions to normal again"

1476
01:53:53,583 --> 01:53:58,375
"And attain peace"

1477
01:54:00,125 --> 01:54:02,083
"Hail to Lord Mrityunjaya!"

1478
01:54:03,708 --> 01:54:05,333
"Siva Mrityunjaya!"

1479
01:54:07,458 --> 01:54:08,958
"Bhava Mrityunjaya!"

1480
01:54:10,708 --> 01:54:11,875
"Ripumjaya!"

1481
01:54:14,875 --> 01:54:16,375
"Hail to Lord Mrityunjaya!"

1482
01:54:18,458 --> 01:54:20,000
"Siva Mrityunjaya!"

1483
01:54:22,250 --> 01:54:23,708
"Bhava Mrityunjaya!"

1484
01:54:25,458 --> 01:54:26,625
"Ripumjaya!"

1485
01:54:35,833 --> 01:54:39,750
"Countless thousands in numbers"

1486
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,208
"Of demon crowd is behind me"

1487
01:54:43,250 --> 01:54:46,500
"Hey three eyed one, Lord Shiva!"

1488
01:54:47,208 --> 01:54:49,625
"I'm alone and you’re my only hope"

1489
01:54:50,833 --> 01:54:53,000
"To fight this ghostly crowd"

1490
01:54:54,875 --> 01:54:56,708
"Bestow me the power"

1491
01:54:58,208 --> 01:55:00,583
"To save lives of the people"

1492
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,083
"Bestow me the tactic"

1493
01:55:20,375 --> 01:55:21,750
"May you win over the world"

1494
01:55:22,250 --> 01:55:23,333
"May you win over the battle"

1495
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:25,250
"May you win over the demons"

1496
01:55:25,750 --> 01:55:27,708
"May you win over the death itself"

1497
01:55:27,750 --> 01:55:29,125
"May you win over the world"

1498
01:55:29,708 --> 01:55:30,875
"May you win over the battle"

1499
01:55:31,625 --> 01:55:32,708
"May you win over the demons"

1500
01:55:33,458 --> 01:55:34,583
"May you win over the death itself"

1501
01:55:38,708 --> 01:55:42,333
"Hail to Lord Shiva!"

1502
01:56:04,750 --> 01:56:06,458
"Hail to Lord Mrityunjaya!"

1503
01:56:08,208 --> 01:56:09,875
"Siva Mrityunjaya!"

1504
01:56:12,125 --> 01:56:13,833
"Bhava Mrityunjaya!"

1505
01:56:15,333 --> 01:56:16,500
"Ripumjaya!"

1506
01:56:19,583 --> 01:56:20,958
"Hail to Lord Mrityunjaya!"

1507
01:56:23,208 --> 01:56:24,708
"Siva Mrityunjaya!"

1508
01:56:26,833 --> 01:56:28,458
"Bhava Mrityunjaya!"

1509
01:56:30,125 --> 01:56:31,375
"Ripumjaya!"

1510
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:40,458
Zombie Vs. Reddy.

1511
01:56:40,958 --> 01:56:44,083
Rayalaseema Reddy who put an end to
Zombie virus at its origin.

1512
01:56:44,458 --> 01:56:48,833
The real hero who saved two villages
from the virus by risking his life!

1513
01:56:49,833 --> 01:56:53,000
Enough cheering for your son's
photo in the news, Pratap Reddy!

1514
01:56:53,333 --> 01:56:54,500
Come and have your food.

1515
01:56:57,083 --> 01:56:58,833
You've given birth to a heroic son.

1516
01:56:58,833 --> 01:57:00,875
Not just zombies, he made
us all dance on his fingers too.

1517
01:57:00,958 --> 01:57:03,583
That's his profession, man.
He is a big gamer.

1518
01:57:03,750 --> 01:57:06,458
Dad, I'm not a gamer,
but a game designer.

1519
01:57:06,458 --> 01:57:07,625
That's what I meant, Mario.

1520
01:57:07,708 --> 01:57:09,708
But why did you name
him such, brother?

1521
01:57:10,458 --> 01:57:12,750
As a successor, his name
should be befitting!

1522
01:57:12,833 --> 01:57:14,375
What do you think Mario
stands for, brother?

1523
01:57:14,500 --> 01:57:16,958
Marripalem Obul Reddy.
I named him after our father.

1524
01:57:19,250 --> 01:57:21,250
Marripalem Obul Reddy?

1525
01:57:21,250 --> 01:57:23,833
What, dude? When Rama Naidu's
grandson could be named Rana...

1526
01:57:23,875 --> 01:57:26,000
Can't Marripalem Obul Reddy's
grandson be named Mario?

1527
01:58:13,583 --> 01:58:15,083
Eat, Pratap. Eat.

1528
01:58:29,250 --> 01:58:30,000
Yes!

1529
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:31,583
We won! We won!

1530
01:58:32,625 --> 01:58:33,875
You dropped a joker, fool!

1531
01:58:47,583 --> 01:58:49,458
Be seated, guys. Be seated.

1532
01:58:49,500 --> 01:58:51,958
As I could see him
walking around than lay lifeless on bed...

1533
01:58:51,958 --> 01:58:53,083
I didn't dip him in the holy pond.

1534
01:58:53,083 --> 01:58:53,583
What!

1535
01:58:53,625 --> 01:58:55,958
Don't worry. Be seated.

1536
01:58:56,333 --> 01:58:57,208
Sit, son.

1537
01:58:57,458 --> 01:58:58,833
Be seated, pal.

1538
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,833
Madam, have some water.

1539
01:59:04,958 --> 01:59:05,958
Water..

1540
01:59:06,708 --> 01:59:07,583
Here..

1541
01:59:07,708 --> 01:59:09,583
Madam, have some water.

1542
01:59:10,583 --> 01:59:11,958
Water, madam.

1543
01:59:12,500 --> 01:59:15,583
Hey, is it you?

1544
01:59:15,708 --> 01:59:17,208
Damn, oldie caught me!

1545
01:59:19,083 --> 01:59:24,833
Every idiot blames my son
saying Pratap Reddy eloped.

1546
01:59:25,250 --> 01:59:27,583
Won't you check when your
house maid went missing?

1547
01:59:55,500 --> 01:59:58,208
Shit! PUBG got banned.
-Really?!

1548
01:59:59,083 --> 02:00:01,750
Don't worry, I have a better idea.

1549
02:00:01,958 --> 02:00:03,083
What's that?

1550
02:00:03,958 --> 02:00:04,958
Zombie Reddy!

1551
02:00:10,208 --> 02:00:13,625
"With blood red eyes
and pitch black nails"

1552
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:17,625
"As body turns cold and
death approaches slowly"

1553
02:00:17,875 --> 02:00:21,458
"Uncontrolled hunger,
craves for fresh meat"

1554
02:00:21,833 --> 02:00:25,125
"I'll bite you till my thirst is quenched"

1555
02:00:25,208 --> 02:00:28,875
"Keep biting, I'll bite even I'm slashed"

1556
02:00:29,083 --> 02:00:32,708
"Keep running, I'll
run till I catch the prey"

1557
02:00:32,875 --> 02:00:36,708
"Keep biting, I'll bite even I'm slashed"

1558
02:00:36,833 --> 02:00:40,583
"Keep running, I'll
run till I catch the prey"

1559
02:00:41,125 --> 02:00:44,958
"Infected man has bitten
and the mind got screwed up"

1560
02:00:48,875 --> 02:00:52,458
"Body is boiling with thirst for blood"

1561
02:00:56,208 --> 02:01:00,083
"Near or dear, I can't control
over the scent of blood"

1562
02:01:03,958 --> 02:01:07,833
"Day or night, I won't stop till
entire world turns into a graveyard"

1563
02:01:27,083 --> 02:01:30,750
"I won't stop even if you stab me"

1564
02:01:30,958 --> 02:01:34,583
"I won't rest even if you chop off my legs"

1565
02:01:34,833 --> 02:01:38,458
"I'll chase you like a mad dog"

1566
02:01:38,708 --> 02:01:42,583
"Till I erase the human race"

1567
02:01:58,083 --> 02:01:59,750
"You could be the greatest of warriors.."

1568
02:01:59,833 --> 02:02:02,000
"I'll chew your necks off."

1569
02:02:05,625 --> 02:02:07,583
"I’m the king of Kalyug"

1570
02:02:07,625 --> 02:02:09,458
"I’m greater than the God of death!"

1571
02:02:26,458 --> 02:02:26,958
.

1572
02:02:48,791 --> 02:02:49,791
THE END
