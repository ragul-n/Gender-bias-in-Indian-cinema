He may have lost his trust in me. But
my faith in him will remain with me

764
01:17:53,921 --> 01:17:56,690
till my last breath.

765
01:17:58,888 --> 01:18:01,490
rhis is the center of art which my wife
regarded as sacred temple itself.

01:19:19,055 --> 01:19:20,322
''At last, that Neelakantham took
even Narasimham's life.''

772
01:19:21,288 --> 01:19:23,990
Even Simhadri was looking aRer
Neelakantham's daughter like his own life.

Now it will all be good fortune.

1164
02:01:08,721 --> 02:01:13,959
My Ganga is free of danger. My golden
child is freed from the evil.

1165
02:01:20,221 --> 02:01:23,691
rhis my Gangotri that was born to save my life
l managed to save her life.

No one has the power to separate Ganga
from me ..

1169
02:01:45,621 --> 02:01:47,622
My Ganga can not be taken away from me.

1170
02:02:08,888 --> 02:02:10,189
Who's that?

1171

''Hey, go aRer him. Catch him. Cut him into
little pieces and bring my Ganga back.''

1175

''ro bring Ganga back, it's not possible
for your guys, nor even for you.''

1176
02:02:54,521 --> 02:02:56,055
What nonsense are you talkingt

1177

''Once it starts in Himalayas, through Rishikesh
Haridvar, Benaras, and Allahabad''

- even lord Siva doesn_ have the power

1179
02:03:06,055 --> 02:03:12,094
to separate her. ro separate your Ganga
from the sea-like Simhadri is impossible

1180

'_or you, and even to the One that created you.''

lt's not now you should be beating her ..
You know when she put the dirty color

1190
02:11:04,721 --> 02:11:06,122
on their young innocent love
you should've beaten her then.

1191
02:11:06,255 --> 02:11:09,725
What will this barren wretch know
the hearts of young onest

1192
02:11:09,888 --> 02:11:12,790
Hey, if you talk any more, l'll kill you.''

1193
02:11:12,855 --> 02:11:17,993
''Hill me. It's nothing new to you. Whoever
opposed you, whoever crossed you ''

1194
02:11:18,088 --> 02:11:22,725
'_ou got them killed so far. At last,
you are killing your own daughter.''

1195
02:11:22,888 --> 02:11:30,295
lt's for the sin of beng born as your daughter
you say you'll kill her.

1196
02:11:30,421 --> 02:11:34,358
''But that young boy, what sin did he do that
you got him beaten so badlyt''

''For thirty years his father served you,
and in anger you murdered him and''

1200
02:11:52,721 --> 02:11:57,392

about how an orphan will live -

1201

ls that why you want to kill himt

1202
02:12:00,455 --> 02:12:04,225
Even the jungle animals kill other
animals only when they are hungy.

1203
02:12:04,388 --> 02:12:07,357
But you seem to want to devour those
who loved you. l loved you the most

at me just once.''

1211
02:14:05,555 --> 02:14:07,823
ro save one's life's not easy as killing.

1212
02:14:10,055 --> 02:14:11,423
Simhadri, get up.''

1213
02:15:01,955 --> 02:15:12,365
''Simhadri, don_ stop. With which song you
saved her once before, ''

1214
02:15:13,788 --> 02:15:20,761
with the same song
you must save her once more.
