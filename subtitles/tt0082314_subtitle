1
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:05,328
Hey,even I'm coming...

2
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:14,774
How far...?

3
00:01:15,308 --> 00:01:18,106
Yes,the path of love is
always like this

4
00:01:18,978 --> 00:01:22,937
The more longer the way is the
more closer the traveler's come

5
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:34,118
And what's this-

6
00:01:35,061 --> 00:01:39,293
Why do we always keep roaming in the
deserted ruins and broken building

7
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:40,132
Do you know

8
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:45,126
Every pillar,each and every
stone of this place

9
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:48,137
It's like... it's like revealing
a story

10
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:50,309
What happened?

11
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:52,311
A thorn...

12
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:54,971
One minute... one minute...

13
00:02:00,186 --> 00:02:01,312
Sapna,we'll not marry

14
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:04,490
Hey,but why,Is all your
love over?

15
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:08,158
It's not like that,if
we get married

16
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:11,490
Even we'll be left with no identity
of our own like other people

17
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:14,325
Who don't have any relation
among themselves

18
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:16,597
Who don't have any turn
in their lives

19
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:19,232
And,if we don't marry,then?

20
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,732
The love was left incomplete,only
then our story will be built

21
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:28,910
Hey what,should our story only be
built,why not our history?

22
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:33,643
Wow!whose Hero will be me and
whose Heroine will be you

23
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:28,627
Hey madam,don't you have eyes
Is there no humanity in you?

24
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,955
Don't you see,I'm chanting
hymns over here

25
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,889
And you're throwing the
peels of egg

26
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:34,563
Sinner... Sinner...
a great sinner...

27
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:35,062
What...?

28
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:37,168
What...? your head...

29
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:40,771
What... what's it,whom
are you threatening?

30
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:44,508
This is the same Maxim,you were
chanting hymns by closing your eyes

31
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:46,269
They came flying through the air
what can I do in that?

32
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:48,204
For your sake,should we stop
having eggs?

33
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:50,041
And start having grass
like you?

34
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:53,309
Even we don't have grass,only
your wisdom has it

35
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:53,884
What...?

36
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,784
Oh God,if she's shouting
like that

37
00:05:56,989 --> 00:05:58,820
Why are you also shouting
like this,you come in

38
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:01,583
Am I shouting,she's only shouting
after throwing the peels of the eggs

39
00:06:02,328 --> 00:06:04,159
Hey Mr. what do you think?

40
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,628
Will I not understand anything
if you abuse me in Tamil?

41
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,528
I'm not going to lose
to you

42
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:11,067
Even,I'll abuse you one after the
other from the Terrace

43
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:11,736
What do you think?

44
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:15,438
Did you see...?

45
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:19,036
Oh madam,we're not
abusing you

46
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:22,840
I was just telling,why is this
fight required,you come in...

47
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:26,348
Yes... oh God! this is the
same Maxim

48
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:28,281
If they don't want to be
our neighbours

49
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:29,783
Let them go and settle down
in a forest

50
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:32,047
Again the same blabberings
the same old non-sense

51
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,618
You keep sticking your butt on
the chair like a pumpkin

52
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:36,920
By not uttering a word

53
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:39,624
Didn't you hear the way he
was shouting in Tamil?

54
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:44,259
Let him shout... He's a
Tamilian...

55
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:46,904
You say that you don't shout
but you always keep shouting

56
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:51,338
Yes... If they shout,will I remain
quiet,will I not swallow them up?

57
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:56,114
I know,if they are a brick
you're a stone

58
00:06:56,315 --> 00:06:57,441
It is better to break my head
with a stone

59
00:06:57,817 --> 00:07:00,615
Than to talk to you
since when I'm talking...

60
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:18,462
The moment I start speaking,she
stops me by ringing an alarm

61
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:20,298
My daughter has found out
a good way

62
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:34,486
What do you want?

63
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:36,488
Have the notes of professor
Munshi Ram come?

64
00:07:38,524 --> 00:07:41,493
No... If you want,I have
"Love's labour lost"

65
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:42,486
I don't want that

66
00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:43,491
Sapna,one minute...

67
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:51,492
Look at this,it's a very interesting
book,just look at it...

68
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:03,348
What? why... how's the photo?

69
00:08:03,716 --> 00:08:04,683
Is it your Mother's?

70
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:30,539
Sir,haven't you seen the board
can't you get up?

71
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:32,374
Even if a woman comes and
stands next to you

72
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:35,210
Wow! If we say something
they'll start shouting

73
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:40,041
We'll damage the bus,burn the
bus and so on... get up...

74
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:42,721
I think,this poor man
doesn't know Hindi

75
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:48,391
Is it... sir... this seat is not meant
for men but only for ladies

76
00:08:52,598 --> 00:08:54,225
The seat is vacant
come on...

77
00:09:03,442 --> 00:09:05,069
It's on my head,that's
already gone...

78
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:06,905
Further,it's Dholapur,get down
there itself

79
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:10,912
This Isn't your Father's bus,that you
can make it stop as & when you feel like

80
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:14,916
Hey,this bus will not stop here
you'll have to go till Dholapur

81
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:28,930
Hey,why are you shouting,has
anybody committed a murder?

82
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:38,272
Don't know,from where he has come
the son of Tarzan?

83
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:54,626
Son,what's this,you've come
without any intimation?

84
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:57,129
First,I've come,the letter
is coming behind

85
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,797
Come my son,come...

86
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:01,800
Mr. Jagannath,what's this
why are you staring?

87
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:02,626
What?

88
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:04,636
Have you got lot of jokers?

89
00:10:04,837 --> 00:10:08,466
No... sir,it's been 1 year since
I've had the glimpse of a joker

90
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:10,634
Look,who has come?

91
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:12,303
Hey what's this,all
of a sudden?

92
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:13,971
Who's he?

93
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:15,314
He's my son

94
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:16,310
Oh! your son

95
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:17,975
Hey,have you come on leave?

96
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:19,142
No...

97
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,487
What about the job?

98
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:26,325
What's the name of
your son?

99
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:32,831
My name is Jagannath
I'm the owner of this house

100
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:35,167
I come for collecting the rent
but I go after paying

101
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:37,666
In the cards,I don't have
any other work

102
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:39,334
Very good,I didn't understand
a bit

103
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:40,163
Good,he has understood

104
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,507
Come on,play your card

105
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:47,342
How can I play,this Mr. has
quit his job

106
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:54,512
What an empty-pride?

107
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:57,189
Father,I don't have an empty-pride
my boss has it,he...

108
00:10:58,224 --> 00:10:59,191
Will you keep quiet
for a while?

109
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:02,027
He badly scolded me,I told him
to take a long walk,and I quit

110
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:04,526
Hey,now-a-days,where it's so difficult
getting a job,have you got brains?

111
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:05,697
Father,I've brains...

112
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:08,700
Oh God! why all this fight when he's
just entered,you come in,my son...

113
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:10,027
I'll brush my teeth
- come...

114
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:15,203
Such a handsome boy
and your son...?

115
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:18,035
What handsome... my foot
he's a snake gourd...

116
00:11:18,744 --> 00:11:21,042
Did you see,what times
have come

117
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:24,708
I educated him till B.Com,got him a
decent job in a good company

118
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:27,552
The boss must've spoken a
little harsh to him

119
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,888
Our man quit the job
and came off

120
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:32,050
Father is great fief
Isn't it

121
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:34,058
He's on his father,Isn't it

122
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:35,553
You've heard that saying
Isn't it

123
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:37,558
Like father,like son...

124
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:40,224
If not much,but at least
a little bit

125
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:06,249
What a strange man
you are?

126
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,252
Even after seeing me,you're
pretending as if you haven't

127
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:11,430
No talk,no shriek how's
your neighbour?

128
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:12,756
Whose leg you broke
out of anger

129
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:16,097
Poor soul,you didn't even think,that
he is the only son for his parents

130
00:12:16,802 --> 00:12:18,429
That person,who's following me
to get rid of him

131
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:19,604
I'm posing my association
with you

132
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:21,269
Even you don't take it
in a wrong way

133
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:26,270
Our Goa boys are really very good
born volunteers...

134
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:28,613
They consider helping girls
as their prime duty

135
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:33,278
There are exceptions like him too
he's more like a beast than a human

136
00:12:33,652 --> 00:12:35,119
I feel like hitting a stone
on his head

137
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:39,283
He ran away,bloody coward...

138
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:44,295
Probably,he got scared of you
thank you so much

139
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,627
Had you not been there,don't know
what would've happened?

140
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:51,133
I don't like coming by this way
but what to do,it's a short-cut

141
00:12:51,837 --> 00:12:54,135
That's my college,okay...

142
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:56,975
But why were you running
like this?

143
00:12:59,678 --> 00:13:00,645
Are you a dumb?

144
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:04,475
Even the God has strange
plays

145
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:06,651
You can not speak...?

146
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:11,145
I don't know Hindi
- Then?

147
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,158
Whatever you may be,but you're
a messenger of God for me

148
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:20,161
"Messenger of God"

149
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:35,506
That's why,I say,to teach
a lesson to such Rowdies

150
00:13:35,714 --> 00:13:37,682
It's very important that
girls learn Karate

151
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:40,181
Just imagine,if there's
a rowdy come for somewhere

152
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:44,348
You see him and vice-versa
he stops and you too

153
00:13:44,723 --> 00:13:45,849
He takes a step forward
towards you

154
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:48,189
And you start...

155
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:51,363
Karate was introduced only
for self-protection

156
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:53,865
I don't know,whether karate
was born in Japan

157
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:54,862
Or it was imparted
from India

158
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:58,036
You have seen that, Bruce Lee's
Enter the Dragon, isn't it

159
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:45,907
My name is Vasu,what's
your name?

160
00:14:58,964 --> 00:14:59,931
Greetings sir...

161
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:00,757
Greetings...

162
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:21,616
Hey,the visiting hours got over
long back

163
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:23,447
Haven't you people
still gone?

164
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:26,955
We're going... we don't want to stay
the whole night at your hospital

165
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:31,122
My dear,I'll leave,tomorrow
morning I'll come with a coffee

166
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:32,297
Come with a good coffee

167
00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:35,800
Here,no body even knows to make
coffee,I'll leave...

168
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:48,806
You save this thanks for that
girl who has sent these flowers

169
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:50,315
I've only brought them

170
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:16,506
Your name is very good,my name
is Sapna,how's it?

171
00:16:46,905 --> 00:16:47,530
This is my Veedu(House)

172
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:49,040
What?

173
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:53,203
That's my house

174
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,547
No... my veedu(House)

175
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:57,716
Oh! that Non-veg. family

176
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:04,389
We've come so closer
to each other...

177
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,387
What do you do?

178
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,336
Are you fine?

179
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:04,004
Meaning?

180
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:06,503
Meaning?

181
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:14,348
It means...

182
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:49,710
Mr. Jagannath,did you see...
our noses have got burnt

183
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:51,214
Because of the bad smell
of their food

184
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:54,552
One day,they have eggs,one day
mutton,one day chicken...

185
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:59,557
Don't they get the taste in their food
unless they commit a murder?

186
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:01,899
Mr. Jagannath,you yourself
tell-

187
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:04,235
Should we stay in this house
or vacate it?

188
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:05,570
I can't tolerate any more

189
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:07,398
Good,let them vacate,we'll
get rid of them

190
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:11,231
This is the same Maxim,they
are Tenants and we're the Owners

191
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:13,578
In my house,I'll do anything
which I feel like

192
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:17,074
What's an egg,out of anger,I may even
fry my husband and eat

193
00:20:17,282 --> 00:20:18,579
Who's he to ask?

194
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:21,920
Madam,you eat your husband
however you feel like

195
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:25,916
But let us live,why can't you
change the direction of your kitchen?

196
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:28,919
Why can't you chop your head
and keep it in a cupboard?

197
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:30,261
The kitchen will be
very much there

198
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:33,590
Should we change our kitchen
for these Tamilians? never...

199
00:20:34,132 --> 00:20:37,590
You always bring South Indians &
North Indians as the bone of contention

200
00:20:38,136 --> 00:20:40,263
I know,all North Indian
are not like you

201
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:43,267
Even I know that all South Indians
are not like you

202
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:21,639
Even if we don't call a Rose
as a Rose

203
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:23,982
Will Rose become some
other flower?

204
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:27,978
What's there in a name
it's all in our mind-

205
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:34,653
It's not a part of our body,like
Head,Hand,Leg,Nose,Ear...

206
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:40,160
When you address
yourself as"I"

207
00:21:40,699 --> 00:21:42,667
A lot of things are included
in this"I"

208
00:21:43,535 --> 00:21:47,494
Body,Soul,Heart,Brain
name is just a mere label

209
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,668
Like,even if we don't call
Romeo as Romeo

210
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:53,671
But still,he'll remain only as
Romeo,Juliet's lover

211
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:58,171
Leave all this,your mother never
addresses me by my name

212
00:21:58,884 --> 00:22:01,512
But this doesn't mean that
I'm no more her husband

213
00:22:14,232 --> 00:22:15,199
What's the meaning of this?

214
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:21,362
It means,good night
Daddy,I'm feeling sleepy

215
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:48,566
What's it?

216
00:22:49,434 --> 00:22:50,230
What's it?

217
00:22:52,437 --> 00:22:53,233
No...

218
00:22:55,774 --> 00:22:56,741
"Love"

219
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:00,745
What account is this?

220
00:23:03,115 --> 00:23:07,074
This is the account
of the heart

221
00:23:24,302 --> 00:23:25,098
Now, where has the love
disappeared?

222
00:23:26,304 --> 00:23:27,100
It has got merged with the sand

223
00:23:27,472 --> 00:23:28,268
In this?

224
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:45,119
What's this, is this a rehearsal of
getting burried alive like Anarkali?

225
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:50,951
No... I'm just seeing,that is
there any other lover like us inside?

226
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:53,456
Here,you'll not find lovers
but you'll find only crabs

227
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:54,298
What?

228
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,468
A crab... is crawling on my hand

229
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:11,979
It's not a crab, it's my hand
it's my finger...

230
00:24:23,862 --> 00:24:25,830
Oh God... DOG...

231
00:24:27,532 --> 00:24:29,500
DOG... DOG

232
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:32,833
It's only a DOG,Isn't it
what can it do?

233
00:24:33,371 --> 00:24:36,829
What the DOG's generally do,if it
thinks us to be a lamp post,then?

234
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:38,839
Yuck...

235
00:24:45,383 --> 00:24:48,352
When ever you meet me,you say
"Are you fine"

236
00:24:48,553 --> 00:24:49,349
What's the meaning
of this?

237
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:52,523
Meaning... Are you fine?

238
00:24:53,058 --> 00:24:56,357
I see... how to say in Tamil
that"I'm fine"?

239
00:24:57,229 --> 00:24:59,026
I'm fine

240
00:24:59,564 --> 00:25:00,531
" NALLA IRUKEN"(I AM FINE)

241
00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:04,194
Not like that
like this...

242
00:25:04,402 --> 00:25:04,868
Oh! like this...

243
00:25:05,403 --> 00:25:10,705
Are you fine? I'm fine...

244
00:25:11,743 --> 00:25:12,710
Why have you come here?

245
00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:16,039
I was seeing how beautiful
you are

246
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:17,545
Yuck... run from here

247
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:25,219
Mother... Are you fine?

248
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:26,716
What?

249
00:25:37,602 --> 00:25:39,069
Learn Tamil in 30 days,do
you have this book?

250
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:39,896
It's there

251
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:42,907
What can I do for you?

252
00:25:44,776 --> 00:25:46,573
Learn Tamil in 30 days
do you have this book?

253
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:48,075
Pregnancy in 10 days,I've
this book-

254
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:51,578
How can a woman experience motherhood
how fast can she experience?

255
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:53,417
What is the way if she
doesn't want to experience?-

256
00:25:53,618 --> 00:25:54,585
That book contains
all these

257
00:25:55,453 --> 00:25:57,080
Tamil is the language
confined only to Madras city

258
00:25:57,455 --> 00:25:59,753
But sex is a universal
language

259
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:05,422
That day,you had told that
this is my Mother's photo

260
00:26:05,797 --> 00:26:11,258
Now,look at it,how's it?

261
00:27:24,042 --> 00:27:41,552
What is this strange bond that
we share between ourselves?

262
00:27:47,232 --> 00:27:52,363
It's neither known to me
nor known to you

263
00:28:32,444 --> 00:28:38,246
One string pulls and the
second comes running

264
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:50,421
It'll come tied by the pull
of brittle strings

265
00:28:50,795 --> 00:28:59,601
Like a mad lover

266
00:29:20,158 --> 00:29:22,626
Oh! Is it like that?

267
00:29:22,827 --> 00:29:25,625
Oh! as if you've understood
everything

268
00:29:46,684 --> 00:29:51,986
I'll wear bracelets from
your hands

269
00:29:57,862 --> 00:30:02,993
The final destination of my Bridal cart
will be at your courtyard

270
00:30:03,535 --> 00:30:15,640
Let the world do anything...

271
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:35,866
Hey,you're extremely
beautiful

272
00:30:36,234 --> 00:30:38,862
What's all this?

273
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:12,901
People speak so many
different languages

274
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:25,079
But there's only one language of "Love"
in the world

275
00:31:25,617 --> 00:31:33,922
Which the candle stick speaks
to the winged white Ant

276
00:31:44,802 --> 00:31:46,599
Not bad,you sing
pretty well

277
00:31:46,971 --> 00:31:47,596
What?

278
00:31:47,972 --> 00:31:48,768
You...

279
00:33:06,384 --> 00:33:08,011
What you did was
not love

280
00:33:08,386 --> 00:33:11,184
The one which can not rise
above sex and lust

281
00:33:11,556 --> 00:33:14,684
That's not true love,you're
not fit for that

282
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:18,188
I thought you as my friend
as my companion

283
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:21,358
But you too turned out to be
an ordinary man like others

284
00:33:21,566 --> 00:33:24,034
And an ordinary man is just
slightly superior to an Animal

285
00:33:27,071 --> 00:33:30,370
This is our last meeting
we'll never meet up again

286
00:33:31,242 --> 00:33:33,870
Now,I regret,why
I met you?

287
00:33:52,597 --> 00:33:53,393
What's all this?

288
00:33:54,098 --> 00:33:55,725
Old news papers and
waste papers

289
00:33:55,933 --> 00:33:57,560
I was told to sell it
to a junk dealer

290
00:33:58,102 --> 00:33:58,727
Who?

291
00:33:59,103 --> 00:34:00,070
Sapna madam

292
00:34:01,773 --> 00:34:02,740
And even that?

293
00:37:36,153 --> 00:37:38,621
Why,have I committed
any mistake?

294
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:46,294
No... only the place of
your kiss was wrong

295
00:38:01,012 --> 00:38:04,140
So,the separation of these 7 days
has still brought us closer

296
00:38:07,685 --> 00:38:09,983
There are 2 things very
exiting in love

297
00:38:11,355 --> 00:38:12,822
Separation and...

298
00:38:14,358 --> 00:38:14,983
Waiting...

299
00:38:16,527 --> 00:38:22,159
This rock is a memorial for the
await of a girl called Donapoala

300
00:38:25,202 --> 00:38:26,169
History itself is like this

301
00:38:27,204 --> 00:38:30,173
A portuguese girl fell in love
with a Goan boy

302
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:31,667
Like us...?

303
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:33,670
Yes,exactly like us

304
00:38:34,378 --> 00:38:37,347
One day,the boy had to go
very far across the Sea

305
00:38:37,715 --> 00:38:38,340
But...

306
00:38:41,052 --> 00:38:42,178
He had to go across
the Sea...

307
00:38:43,387 --> 00:38:44,513
But he never returned

308
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:48,688
Why,what happened to him
no body knows

309
00:38:49,727 --> 00:38:52,025
But the girl kept constantly
waiting for him...

310
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:54,697
Then,after standing on
this Rock

311
00:38:55,566 --> 00:38:56,863
She herself became a Rock

312
00:38:57,401 --> 00:38:58,698
And one day,even
If I go

313
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:01,197
Will you also wait for me
on this Rock?

314
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:03,536
No need of all this
Rubbish things

315
00:39:03,908 --> 00:39:06,376
First I want to make good
the loss for 7 days

316
00:39:06,577 --> 00:39:07,703
When how and where?

317
00:39:08,746 --> 00:39:12,204
Okay,for 7 days,I'll
sit besides you

318
00:39:12,416 --> 00:39:13,041
Is it okay?

319
00:39:13,584 --> 00:39:16,052
Even 7 days are not required
only 24 hours

320
00:39:16,587 --> 00:39:20,216
Should we go somewhere for a hitch-hiking
I'll show you the entire Goa

321
00:39:21,425 --> 00:39:23,222
What okay... what about
your Mother?

322
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:25,729
Keep quiet man

323
00:39:26,097 --> 00:39:27,394
Just watch,how I'll manage
with my Mother

324
00:40:28,659 --> 00:40:33,619
We are made for each other

325
00:40:40,337 --> 00:40:48,472
I swear upon him,even if I stay
for a moment away from him

326
00:41:14,705 --> 00:41:23,170
You are stupid,accept it,you are
handsome,understand it

327
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:34,351
Leaving all other things
recognise the eyes

328
00:41:34,725 --> 00:41:38,525
Eyes have made such promises
to each other

329
00:43:30,507 --> 00:43:35,638
There is no way of
expressing love

330
00:43:36,013 --> 00:43:38,811
That's why poet Ghalib
has told this

331
00:43:39,183 --> 00:43:47,648
We are made for each other
understood?

332
00:44:38,409 --> 00:44:40,036
Madam, why are you crying?

333
00:44:40,411 --> 00:44:42,208
If you cry will you reach
home early?

334
00:44:42,913 --> 00:44:45,711
Then tell me, how will we go
the watch is showing 11 o'clock

335
00:44:45,916 --> 00:44:47,543
The board is showing 16 kms.

336
00:44:47,751 --> 00:44:50,049
The petrol is over and we
are also financially broke

337
00:44:50,254 --> 00:44:54,213
I spoke a lie at home and came
now,it's mid-night

338
00:44:54,758 --> 00:44:56,225
The watch is 5 minutes
fast

339
00:45:09,106 --> 00:45:10,903
Sir,will you give us lift
till PANJIM?

340
00:45:15,279 --> 00:45:18,407
Husband wife and the motorcycle
had gone to Vasco-Da-gama for honeymoon

341
00:45:18,615 --> 00:45:21,743
But there was a pick pocket
the petrol is exhausted

342
00:45:42,306 --> 00:45:44,274
Even I had gone to Vasco-Da-gama
on a marriage

343
00:45:44,475 --> 00:45:46,443
In the mean time,you even
got married to him?

344
00:45:47,811 --> 00:45:48,607
What's your name?

345
00:45:48,812 --> 00:45:50,780
Why do you need name,you can
abuse me just like that

346
00:45:50,981 --> 00:45:52,107
So much of haughtiness?-

347
00:45:52,316 --> 00:45:54,784
Making a young girl speak a
lie at home and bringing her out

348
00:45:54,985 --> 00:45:56,612
And making her roam like a
Vagabond,Is this a joke?

349
00:45:57,988 --> 00:46:01,116
In future,if you look at our house
I'll not only abuse you,but...

350
00:46:02,659 --> 00:46:05,787
Sapna,get into the car
come...

351
00:46:10,501 --> 00:46:11,468
Poor soul,Vasu...

352
00:46:11,668 --> 00:46:14,296
He'll come back running behind
the car, he's a hero, isn't it

353
00:46:14,838 --> 00:46:16,465
Driver,start the car
- Sir...

354
00:46:16,673 --> 00:46:18,300
Are you deaf,start
the car

355
00:46:23,514 --> 00:46:28,144
We are made for each other
understood?

356
00:47:12,062 --> 00:47:15,361
Sorry Vasu,you came walking all
the way in the night

357
00:47:15,566 --> 00:47:17,363
Walking... and me...? Never...

358
00:47:17,568 --> 00:47:19,195
Then,how did you come?
- On the motor bike

359
00:47:19,403 --> 00:47:20,028
And petrol?

360
00:47:20,237 --> 00:47:21,363
Why is petrol required?

361
00:47:21,572 --> 00:47:23,699
I was on the motorbike
the motorbike was on the lorry

362
00:47:23,907 --> 00:47:26,205
And the lorry charges
were on my father

363
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:29,379
You had to take so much
of trouble for my sake

364
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:30,376
Trouble...?

365
00:47:31,915 --> 00:47:33,883
I can do anything for you

366
00:47:34,585 --> 00:47:35,210
Anything

367
00:47:35,419 --> 00:47:38,388
Everything,our's is an
Immortal love,Isn't it

368
00:47:38,589 --> 00:47:39,715
Now,tell me,what
should I do?

369
00:47:41,425 --> 00:47:42,392
Do you know swimming?

370
00:47:43,293 --> 00:47:44,385
What is that?

371
00:47:47,064 --> 00:47:49,055
Jump... let me see...?

372
00:47:52,936 --> 00:47:53,800
It's an Immortal love
Isn't it?

373
00:48:16,593 --> 00:48:19,926
Someone please save... somebody
is drowning in the water...

374
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:27,268
He doesn't know swimming,someone
please save... please save...

375
00:48:37,781 --> 00:48:39,908
I went to catch fish
I caught him

376
00:48:40,117 --> 00:48:41,448
Just see,if he's breathing
or not?

377
00:48:42,686 --> 00:48:43,345
Vasu,regain consciousness

378
00:48:50,394 --> 00:48:53,192
Vasu, I accept that your Love
for me is immortal

379
00:49:05,742 --> 00:49:06,800
Hey,don't shake!

380
00:49:09,813 --> 00:49:10,609
What are you writing?

381
00:49:12,015 --> 00:49:14,313
I saw your back as shining
as a Glass

382
00:49:15,018 --> 00:49:16,508
I thought,let me write
a Love letter

383
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:20,146
Are you writing some joke,it's
making me laugh

384
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:22,151
Hey,wait for sometime

385
00:49:27,698 --> 00:49:28,357
It's over...

386
00:49:29,066 --> 00:49:29,657
What have you written?

387
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:30,723
Read it yourself

388
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:38,535
Hey,tell me,what have
you written?

389
00:49:38,875 --> 00:49:39,500
I'll not tell

390
00:49:40,410 --> 00:49:41,843
You'll not tell
- No

391
00:49:42,212 --> 00:49:44,703
Alright,I'll tell someone
else to read it

392
00:49:46,116 --> 00:49:47,413
Will you make someone else
read a love letter?

393
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:52,512
I'll not tell it to a stranger
I'll tell my mother to read it

394
00:49:52,856 --> 00:49:53,515
To Mother...?

395
00:50:00,897 --> 00:50:01,363
Mother...

396
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:07,361
What do you want?

397
00:50:08,905 --> 00:50:10,338
It's been how many years since
you've come to North India?

398
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:12,672
It's been 6 years
but why?

399
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:17,470
It's been 6 years,Isn't it
do you know to read & write Hindi?

400
00:50:17,914 --> 00:50:19,108
Hey,what's this,today you
are speaking in Hindi?

401
00:50:19,316 --> 00:50:21,580
First tell me,can you
read Hindi?

402
00:50:22,152 --> 00:50:22,743
Little bit

403
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:25,745
Only little bit,Isn't it,okay
then read this little bit

404
00:50:29,126 --> 00:50:33,893
I Love you,"a mad girl"

405
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:36,264
Oh!God,who's that mad girl?

406
00:50:37,567 --> 00:50:39,125
The adjacent house mad girl
Sapna...

407
00:50:39,936 --> 00:50:42,962
That Girl...?who are they
and who are we?

408
00:50:43,273 --> 00:50:44,240
Is it Practically possible?

409
00:50:44,474 --> 00:50:45,406
How's this possible?

410
00:50:45,942 --> 00:50:50,345
If you think,it's possible,Oh God!
Mother... where are your feet?

411
00:50:53,316 --> 00:50:54,078
Oh!God!...

412
00:50:54,584 --> 00:50:56,916
What...?- Turn back...
- But why?

413
00:50:57,287 --> 00:51:00,120
Mangalam,what are you doing?

414
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:01,952
I'm oil massaging the child

415
00:51:02,459 --> 00:51:04,757
You're applying oil,let 10 more
years pass off

416
00:51:05,629 --> 00:51:07,597
Mr. Jagannath,come here
- Coming

417
00:51:10,133 --> 00:51:11,600
Look,what's going on
over here?

418
00:51:13,703 --> 00:51:15,933
She's oil massaging a 20 years
old Donkey

419
00:51:18,275 --> 00:51:21,438
If he's given such a Royal treatment
will he ever go out for work?

420
00:51:22,813 --> 00:51:24,644
You get him a job,is he
refusing for it?

421
00:51:26,817 --> 00:51:27,283
Wow!

422
00:51:41,498 --> 00:51:41,987
Stop!

423
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:46,997
Sapna,I never expected
this from you

424
00:51:47,704 --> 00:51:49,638
I never ever thought that you'll
turn out to be such a girl

425
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:50,838
Daddy,what type of a Girl?

426
00:51:52,175 --> 00:51:54,973
The way you are
you know my anger

427
00:51:55,846 --> 00:51:58,474
I'm watching the drama going
on between father & daughter

428
00:51:59,182 --> 00:52:00,979
Father,is uttering false words
of displease

429
00:52:01,418 --> 00:52:03,852
And the daughter is pretending
to be innocent

430
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:05,549
Mother,what do you
want to say?

431
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:08,819
I don't want to say but I want to
ask you,what's all this?

432
00:52:14,431 --> 00:52:15,557
Now,why have you become
speechless?

433
00:52:15,866 --> 00:52:16,332
Come on say!

434
00:52:17,834 --> 00:52:21,326
The photo is good,give him Rs. 10
and ask him to get out

435
00:52:22,572 --> 00:52:24,233
Had it been in colour,it would've
still been better

436
00:52:25,041 --> 00:52:27,100
Shameless,now tell me,how many
colours are you able to see?

437
00:52:27,844 --> 00:52:30,278
I'm asking her about the photo
she's giving me all stupid answers

438
00:52:31,081 --> 00:52:32,241
Has she become so great?

439
00:52:32,782 --> 00:52:36,218
Only now,I've come to know,what
you do staying outside so late

440
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:39,354
She's born only to put a blemish
on our forehead

441
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:42,187
From tomorrow,if you don't
come straight home after college

442
00:52:42,392 --> 00:52:43,256
I'll break your legs
understood?

443
00:52:45,862 --> 00:52:48,763
She-devil,what are you looking at
me for,get away from my sight

444
00:53:16,293 --> 00:53:17,920
I'll come in the evening to
pick you up,understood

445
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:51,758
Vasu,why did you come here?

446
00:53:51,962 --> 00:53:53,589
What other way is there
to meet you?

447
00:53:53,964 --> 00:53:55,261
Your mother has become
your Body-Guard

448
00:53:55,966 --> 00:53:57,934
She always conceals you
in her saree

449
00:53:58,134 --> 00:53:59,328
Vasu,what can I do?

450
00:53:59,536 --> 00:54:01,436
I can do,come with me
- Now...?

451
00:54:04,975 --> 00:54:05,498
But mother...?

452
00:54:06,676 --> 00:54:07,938
Mother comes only in the evening
Isn't it...

453
00:54:19,856 --> 00:54:21,289
The food was too good
my stomach is dead

454
00:54:22,158 --> 00:54:22,783
What,stomach...?

455
00:54:23,159 --> 00:54:23,625
Is dead!

456
00:54:26,062 --> 00:54:28,223
Not dead,but fully filled

457
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:31,797
Hindi is a very difficult
language

458
00:54:32,669 --> 00:54:34,466
Are you not having
the ice-cream?- No

459
00:54:36,239 --> 00:54:37,638
My hair has become full

460
00:54:39,009 --> 00:54:39,475
Hair...?

461
00:54:40,176 --> 00:54:40,642
Yes...

462
00:54:42,846 --> 00:54:43,870
You mean to say,stomach
Isn't it

463
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:44,546
Yes...

464
00:54:49,719 --> 00:54:51,152
Not Hair... but stomach

465
00:54:51,955 --> 00:54:53,149
What's there to laugh
on this?

466
00:54:54,891 --> 00:54:56,358
What you said was hair

467
00:54:59,696 --> 00:55:00,993
Tamil is a very difficult
language

468
00:55:16,746 --> 00:55:18,771
What's this,why have you stopped
the lift in between?

469
00:55:20,517 --> 00:55:24,009
To be with you for a
very long time

470
00:55:24,754 --> 00:55:27,052
I have my Hindi
poetry class

471
00:55:29,426 --> 00:55:32,691
It's Hindi Poetry class,Isn't it
I'll teach you

472
00:55:33,396 --> 00:55:34,863
You?... and Hindi Poem...?

473

It's only my heart...
I'm the lover of beauty

485
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:12,459
Our dreams,infront of
your house

486
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:16,220
Face to face,after marriage

487
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:18,128
After marriage,Oh!God!

00:57:20,336 --> 00:57:23,134

496
00:57:51,067 --> 00:57:51,658
Shameless

497
00:57:53,102 --> 00:57:55,696
The season of love
- Shameless...

498
00:58:13,022 --> 00:58:13,681
Go... Go...

499
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:58,095
Love... Love... Love...

500
00:59:03,439 --> 00:59:08,741
These paths are of love
by walking my companion

501
00:59:08,945 --> 00:59:09,411
What?

502
00:59:09,779 --> 00:59:16,082
Companion,you're mad in love

Fraud,unknown,lover,stranger
Loafer,stupid

505
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:30,261
The one which grows is a Beard
the one which moves is a vehicle

506
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:35,264
When some one falls in love
my lover...

507
00:59:35,705 --> 00:59:40,608
When we get some one's
remembrance,my lover

508

515
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:06,189
Wow!what an excellent duet
they sang

516
01:01:18,408 --> 01:01:19,033
What's your father's name?

517
01:01:21,577 --> 01:01:22,043
Sir,I forgot...

518
01:01:22,712 --> 01:01:25,374
Bloody rascal,you're not worthy
of finding a job for yourself

519
01:01:25,581 --> 01:01:26,548
Why do you want love...?

520
01:01:26,916 --> 01:01:27,382
Love?...

521
01:01:28,384 --> 01:01:30,079
We love each other

522
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:33,216
Did you see,he's wantonly
replying in Hindi

523
01:01:33,890 --> 01:01:35,619
We're not left worthy of
showing our face outside

524
01:01:35,958 --> 01:01:37,789
In broad day light and
that too in a public place

525
01:01:38,161 --> 01:01:39,958
Why do you need to sing a song
Just like in a movie...

526
01:01:40,797 --> 01:01:42,594
We love each other

527
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:45,230
Didn't you feel ashamed?

528
01:01:46,002 --> 01:01:48,163
For so long,you were inside
the lift with a stranger

529
01:01:48,604 --> 01:01:50,401
First,give me an answer
then,you go in

530
01:01:51,174 --> 01:01:52,573
We both love each other

531
01:01:55,778 --> 01:01:58,645
Let your love get ruined...
this is the same Maxim

532
01:01:59,048 --> 01:02:01,312
Where has that Rascal come from
to put us to shame?

533
01:02:01,517 --> 01:02:03,747
He should die of cholera
he should die a Dog's death

534
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:09,915
I'm asking you,what's your age... that
you're roaming around with a stranger?

535
01:02:10,293 --> 01:02:10,759
Tell me...?

536
01:02:11,194 --> 01:02:12,593
We both love each other

537
01:02:13,930 --> 01:02:15,420
But,who's this Mr. Haribabu?

538
01:02:15,932 --> 01:02:17,661
Mr. Haribabu is a very good
friend of mine

539
01:02:18,534 --> 01:02:21,002
Yes... he's a very big
Auditor in Hyderabad

540
01:02:21,204 --> 01:02:22,831
So,will Vasu work
in Hyderabad?

541
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:24,097
Yes... yes

542
01:02:25,208 --> 01:02:27,108
I'll not got to Hyderabad
- Why?

543
01:02:27,877 --> 01:02:29,936
I'll not go,that's it,get me
some job in Goa itself

544
01:02:30,713 --> 01:02:31,611
That's all,I'll not go

545
01:02:32,482 --> 01:02:34,279
Son,you should go...

546
01:02:34,550 --> 01:02:35,448
Why, son...?

547
01:02:35,918 --> 01:02:38,716
He doesn't want a job
he only wants a girl

548
01:02:40,223 --> 01:02:41,986
Why are you talking like this
- You, keep quiet

549
01:02:43,659 --> 01:02:45,718
Jullie,the only difference
between us is that

550
01:02:47,163 --> 01:02:49,961
You have a collar around your
neck and I don't have

551
01:02:51,067 --> 01:02:54,901
If I keep watching at you like this
I think,one day,I'll go mad

552
01:02:55,705 --> 01:02:58,139
And probably,I'll start
barking like you

553
01:02:58,875 --> 01:03:01,969
This dog's face is thousand times
better than that Rascal's

554
01:03:02,645 --> 01:03:03,805
Mother,it's okay,if it's
only the Dog

555
01:03:04,213 --> 01:03:06,477
But,I've to see even your face
for all the 24 hours

556
01:03:14,690 --> 01:03:16,885
You'll go mad by looking
at that Dog

557
01:03:17,126 --> 01:03:18,093
This is the same Maxim

558
01:03:18,661 --> 01:03:21,494
Look,how that loafer is taking
circles around our house

559
01:03:22,031 --> 01:03:24,158
He should die of cholera,only then
we can get rid of him

560
01:03:35,478 --> 01:03:37,742
Do you want to show the entire
city the act of your shamefulness?

561
01:03:38,047 --> 01:03:41,346
Come... come and sit
there properly

562
01:03:42,151 --> 01:03:46,053
Otherwise,I'll cut you into pieces and
throw it down to that Dog,understood...

563
01:04:19,989 --> 01:04:22,549
Sapna,why were you not seen
the entire day?

564
01:04:27,697 --> 01:04:29,187
Have your family members
house arrested you?

565
01:04:30,433 --> 01:04:30,899
Tell me?

566
01:04:34,070 --> 01:04:35,094
Did they beat you?

567
01:04:42,345 --> 01:04:45,837
Sapna,don't cry,no body
can separate us

568
01:04:46,849 --> 01:04:47,406
The entire world...

569
01:04:49,518 --> 01:04:50,917
Let the entire world
turn against us

570
01:04:51,387 --> 01:04:52,581
Even then,we both
will be one

571
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:57,753
What are you looking at?

572
01:04:58,895 --> 01:05:00,522
Let me see,what these
people can do?

573
01:05:04,467 --> 01:05:08,733
Got ruined... we are
left no where

574
01:05:08,938 --> 01:05:10,929
My daughter's life has
got ruined

575
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:13,108
The respect of this family
has gone to Dogs

576
01:05:13,342 --> 01:05:14,741
Is there no one,who can
stop him?

577
01:05:14,944 --> 01:05:18,175
Is there no respected person who
can save someone else's respect?

578
01:05:18,447 --> 01:05:19,436
Hey,where are you?

579
01:05:25,488 --> 01:05:29,549
In the world's history of Love
this chapter is not for the first time

580
01:05:30,426 --> 01:05:31,620
This comes everytime

581
01:05:32,862 --> 01:05:35,228
The young love understands
only one language

582
01:05:36,132 --> 01:05:36,962
The language of Love

583
01:05:38,334 --> 01:05:40,302
The old wisdom,burried into
the grave of time

584
01:05:40,503 --> 01:05:42,266
Only know to create the
walls of separation

585
01:05:43,072 --> 01:05:45,905
Some times,the walls of languages
sometimes,the walls of caste

586
01:05:46,676 --> 01:05:49,907
Sometimes,the walls of wealth
sometimes,the walls of hatred

587
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,214
From the time,History
is in practice

588
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:57,317
From then,this fight between the
young & old is also being practiced

589
01:05:58,354 --> 01:06:00,481
Neither,the old has taken
it's last breath

590
01:06:01,324 --> 01:06:03,315
Nor the young has accepted
it's defeat

591
01:06:07,997 --> 01:06:14,425
We Love each other,we'll get
married,nobody can stop us

592
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:19,832
After this... now you can say
whatever you feel like

593
01:06:21,377 --> 01:06:25,006
You people are elder to us
in age and also in experience

594
01:06:25,381 --> 01:06:28,873
But still,there is not even one
who can peep into our heart's

595
01:06:29,285 --> 01:06:30,115
And try understand us

596
01:06:30,686 --> 01:06:33,177
They don't understand us,because
we respect them

597
01:06:33,622 --> 01:06:34,554
We treat them as
our elders

598
01:06:34,957 --> 01:06:36,891
Had Vasu stealthily eloped
with me

599
01:06:37,226 --> 01:06:38,523
Then,what you people could
have done?

600
01:06:41,530 --> 01:06:42,622
What ever we have done

601
01:06:43,099 --> 01:06:44,691
We've confined ourselves to the
limitations of respect

602
01:06:45,067 --> 01:06:46,591
Had we crossed those limits

603
01:06:46,802 --> 01:06:48,861
You couldn't have uttered a
word out of shame, isn't it

604
01:06:49,238 --> 01:06:50,205
Scoundrel,shut your mouth

605
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:53,265
Having born in a orthodox
brahmin family

606
01:06:53,776 --> 01:06:56,244
Do you want to marry a girl who
eat's non-veg?

607
01:06:56,979 --> 01:06:57,775
Aren't you ashamed of it?

608
01:06:58,914 --> 01:07:00,575
I'll stop eating non-veg.

609
01:07:01,050 --> 01:07:03,780
Oh! such a big sacrifice?

610
01:07:08,257 --> 01:07:09,053
Oh God!...

611
01:07:09,525 --> 01:07:10,549
Then,will you be satisfied?

612
01:07:10,893 --> 01:07:12,861
Did you listen,this is all the
tricks of these Tamilians

613
01:07:14,196 --> 01:07:15,220
This is the same Maxim

614
01:07:15,464 --> 01:07:18,194
Why should we get our daughter
married to these Tamilian's Son?

615
01:07:18,401 --> 01:07:20,232
Do we fall short of boys
in our city?

616
01:07:22,638 --> 01:07:23,832
Again the same old fight
of language?

617
01:07:24,273 --> 01:07:27,071
If language is the only
objection for you people

618
01:07:28,544 --> 01:07:30,569
Then give me 1 month's time

619
01:07:31,113 --> 01:07:33,411
I'll learn Hindi and I'll also
be able to teach you

620
01:07:33,749 --> 01:07:37,241
I'll even write poetry in
Hindi and show you

621
01:07:37,953 --> 01:07:38,749
Oh yes... poem...

622
01:07:43,359 --> 01:07:46,385
Son,you'll definitely write,but with
cowdung on our forehead

623
01:07:46,762 --> 01:07:49,253
Your parents have given you birth
only for this Auspicious deed

624
01:07:49,465 --> 01:07:49,931
Listen...

625
01:07:50,266 --> 01:07:51,062
Please be quiet for
some time

626
01:07:51,667 --> 01:07:55,433
Look,they are anyways children
but,we're elders...

627
01:07:55,638 --> 01:07:57,538
What,even if we don't
behave as elders?

628
01:07:58,507 --> 01:08:01,067
We must think as to what
has to be done

629
01:08:01,644 --> 01:08:02,770
What should we do?

630
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:07,945
First,take your hands off
first take your hands off...

631
01:08:10,052 --> 01:08:13,453
What's the love at this age
It's only Lust

632
01:08:14,123 --> 01:08:15,112
Lust!... my foot...

633
01:08:16,192 --> 01:08:19,161
This word,every father,since
generations in repeating it

634
01:08:19,361 --> 01:08:21,955
Even this mistake,every son since
generations is making it

635
01:08:22,164 --> 01:08:25,327
But every father forgets the fact
that he was also a son

636
01:08:25,901 --> 01:08:27,892
You'll not understand this till
you become a father

637
01:08:28,737 --> 01:08:31,001
That's why,I'm asking you to
get me married

638
01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:33,570
Bloody Rascal,I'll break
your jaw

639
01:08:35,211 --> 01:08:36,439
He's speaking to me
in Hindi?

640
01:08:38,747 --> 01:08:41,545
Why all this is required
our's is true love

641
01:08:41,884 --> 01:08:44,375
Tell us,what are we supposed
to do to prove it?

642
01:08:44,587 --> 01:08:45,747
We are ready to do

643
01:08:54,463 --> 01:08:58,593
Look sir,If you agree,I'll give
you all a suggestion

644
01:08:59,368 --> 01:09:01,563
Separate both of them
for a year

645
01:09:01,971 --> 01:09:04,940
And even after that,If they want
to marry each other

646
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:08,406
Then,we'll agree,that their love
is only love and not Lust

647
01:09:14,183 --> 01:09:15,810
Why,what do you think?

648
01:09:16,118 --> 01:09:19,246
I see... after that,will we
have to get them married?

649
01:09:19,622 --> 01:09:20,350
Go...

650
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:23,515
Not only 1 year,even after
100 years

651
01:09:23,826 --> 01:09:25,191
I'll not agree for their marriage

652
01:09:25,394 --> 01:09:26,224
It's impossible

653
01:09:26,529 --> 01:09:31,557
Wo are you to say this,first I'm
telling,that I don't agree for this proposal

654
01:09:31,767 --> 01:09:33,029
It's impossible by me

655
01:09:33,335 --> 01:09:36,099
How is this Jagannath affected by it
he'll blabber,whatever he feels like

656
01:09:36,305 --> 01:09:38,739
He has no one around him,he
has no children... and so on...

657
01:09:39,008 --> 01:09:42,808
Sister,don't refuse so early
give a little more thought

658
01:09:44,613 --> 01:09:47,241
Yes my dear,we should definitely
give a due thought

659
01:09:48,083 --> 01:09:50,210
Even Jagannath's suggestion
looks practical

660
01:09:51,086 --> 01:09:52,553
Why Vasu,Is it okay?

661
01:09:52,755 --> 01:09:54,382
It's not okay,mother,why
all this is required?

662
01:09:54,590 --> 01:09:55,716
Is this any kind of examination?

663
01:09:55,925 --> 01:09:57,552
We outrightly refuse it

664
01:09:59,929 --> 01:10:03,057
Vasu,why don't we agree,are we
scared of their examination?

665
01:10:04,099 --> 01:10:06,397
Let them try their best,our love
for each other will not decrease

666
01:10:07,436 --> 01:10:11,065
Our love will not diminish
this is my firm belief

667
01:10:11,273 --> 01:10:15,232
Is it,then for 1 year they
can-not meet with each other...

668
01:10:16,278 --> 01:10:18,075
They can not talk
to each other

669
01:10:18,447 --> 01:10:19,243
Alright

670
01:10:19,448 --> 01:10:21,245
They can't even exchange letters
between themselves

671
01:10:21,450 --> 01:10:22,246
Alright

672
01:10:23,118 --> 01:10:25,586
They shouldn't even stay in
the same city

673
01:10:26,455 --> 01:10:27,922
I'll send him to Hyderabad

674
01:10:28,123 --> 01:10:30,091
Oh! so finally,you found
an opportunity

675
01:10:31,293 --> 01:10:33,420
You've decided among yourselves
that's all...

676
01:10:33,963 --> 01:10:34,930
We...

677
01:10:36,966 --> 01:10:41,426
Vasu,what's there in it,why are you
so obstinate about it?

678
01:10:41,971 --> 01:10:42,767
Agree...

679
01:10:46,141 --> 01:10:46,937
You don't understand

680
01:10:47,142 --> 01:10:49,110
No Vasu,I only...

681
01:10:49,478 --> 01:10:52,606
You leave about their opinion,first,we'll
have to take a decision,come

682
01:10:52,815 --> 01:10:54,612
Why,can't you take the decision
over here?

683
01:10:54,817 --> 01:10:58,617
No.. here,It'll end up
in smoke

684
01:11:03,158 --> 01:11:06,616
I hate this business of
proving something

685
01:11:06,996 --> 01:11:09,123
Who are others to make us
prove our love?

686
01:11:10,332 --> 01:11:13,961
Vasu,they are not other's,they are our
parent's,who gave us birth

687
01:11:14,169 --> 01:11:16,137
Who brought us up

688
01:11:16,505 --> 01:11:18,302
Their blessings will definitely
be good for us

689
01:11:18,841 --> 01:11:19,637
It'll not be bad

690
01:11:20,509 --> 01:11:21,806
Vasu,listen to me
carefully

691
01:11:22,678 --> 01:11:24,976
There are 3 things very
important for love

692
01:11:25,514 --> 01:11:28,972
Good manners,little patience and
a lot of mental balance

693
01:11:29,685 --> 01:11:30,811
Vasu,agree to their conditions

694
01:11:31,687 --> 01:11:34,315
I have full faith,by the
grace of this God

695
01:11:34,857 --> 01:11:36,324
We'll come out with flying colours
in this examination

696
01:11:36,525 --> 01:11:37,321
But...

697
01:11:38,694 --> 01:11:39,661
Agree for my sake...

698
01:11:44,033 --> 01:11:47,992
But these elder's are too clever
they can even deceive us in the end

699
01:11:48,370 --> 01:11:50,338
That's why,it's has to be written
black & white on a paper

700
01:11:50,539 --> 01:11:52,507
That after 1 year,they'll get
us married

701
01:11:52,708 --> 01:11:54,676
And on that,their...

702
01:11:55,878 --> 01:11:57,004
We should even take their
signatures

703
01:11:57,212 --> 01:11:58,008
You mean to say,an agreement?

704
01:11:58,213 --> 01:12:00,010
Yes,and that too on a
stamp paper

705
01:12:14,396 --> 01:12:17,854
Vasu,now we'll meet up
after 365 days,till then...

706
01:12:23,906 --> 01:12:25,203
Our agreement has started...

707
01:14:06,008 --> 01:14:08,977
Vasu,why have you come back?

708
01:14:12,181 --> 01:14:13,148
No Vaus,no...

709
01:14:13,348 --> 01:14:14,815
Sapna,without seeing you...

710
01:14:22,357 --> 01:14:23,324
Vasu,please go...

711
01:14:25,027 --> 01:14:28,155
Still not even a few hours have elapsed
that our agreement has started

712
01:14:28,697 --> 01:14:30,494
Why should we give people a chance
to point their fingers on us

713
01:14:31,033 --> 01:14:34,002
That their love was so
feble,week

714
01:14:34,536 --> 01:14:36,504
Which couldn't even bear the
separation of few hours

715
01:14:37,539 --> 01:14:39,666
And there are thousand's of
hours in a year

716
01:14:40,209 --> 01:14:44,669
Vasu,we should keep up our promise
we'll have to abide by the agreement

717
01:14:45,380 --> 01:14:47,177
Vasu,go... please go...

718
01:14:49,718 --> 01:14:51,185
What's my fault,what's
my crime?

719
01:14:55,057 --> 01:14:56,354
I stayed away from you only for
a few hours

720
01:14:56,725 --> 01:14:59,523
But I couldn't stay,how am I
going to stay for a year?

721
01:14:59,728 --> 01:15:01,025
And why the hell
should I stay?

722
01:15:02,397 --> 01:15:04,365
In this city,people who know you
people who don't know you

723
01:15:04,566 --> 01:15:08,696
Animals,Birds,Trees,and more over...
the smallest of all the Ant can see you..

724
01:15:09,071 --> 01:15:10,698
Only I can't see you...?

725
01:15:14,243 --> 01:15:16,711
If this is Justice,then it's also
justified to break this agreement

726
01:15:17,746 --> 01:15:19,043
Vasu,why don't you try
to understand?

727
01:15:19,248 --> 01:15:19,873
What should I understand?

728
01:15:20,916 --> 01:15:24,215
Our agreement is not a matter
of court case

729
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:28,219
This has been given birth to
strengthen our Love and belief

730
01:15:29,591 --> 01:15:30,387
Vasu,do one thing

731
01:15:30,592 --> 01:15:31,217
What?

732
01:15:31,927 --> 01:15:34,555
You arrest me into your eyes
for a year

733
01:15:35,597 --> 01:15:36,894
But,don't come and meet me

734
01:15:38,267 --> 01:15:41,896
Think,that these 365 days
never came in our lives

735
01:15:43,105 --> 01:15:45,403
After that,you'll always
see me

736
01:15:46,275 --> 01:15:47,572
You'll keep seeing me
for life long

737
01:15:48,944 --> 01:15:51,913
Forgive me,if I've hurt
your feelings

738
01:15:52,781 --> 01:15:54,408
But,Vasu,now you go...

739
01:15:55,784 --> 01:15:57,251
You can understand my
condition

740
01:15:57,953 --> 01:16:00,751
Even,I can't stay for a minute
away from you

741
01:16:01,623 --> 01:16:04,251
And today,when you've come
to meet me

742
01:16:04,626 --> 01:16:06,423
I'm asking you to go

743
01:16:07,462 --> 01:16:10,090
How much I would have felt
while saying this?

744
01:16:10,632 --> 01:16:11,758
How sorry and sad
I would have felt?

745
01:16:12,968 --> 01:16:15,596
But,we'll have to bear
this sorrow

746
01:16:16,305 --> 01:16:18,273
Vasu,we'll have to bear
go...

747
01:16:28,817 --> 01:16:29,784
Sapna,forgive me

748
01:16:47,336 --> 01:16:51,136
Sapna,forgive me,I lost my
senses out of enthusiasm

749
01:16:52,507 --> 01:16:57,809
Now,I promise to fulfill that
agreement for your Love

750
01:16:59,014 --> 01:17:00,311
Now,I'm leaving this city

751
01:17:02,517 --> 01:17:05,645
But Sapna,how can I stay
without remembering you?

752
01:17:06,855 --> 01:17:09,824
That's why,I'll daily write
you a letter

753
01:17:10,525 --> 01:17:11,651
But,I'll not post it

754
01:17:12,861 --> 01:17:16,319
And all those remembrances
of your's for these 365 days...

755
01:17:17,032 --> 01:17:22,993
I'll place all that on your feet
after 1 year

756
01:17:25,540 --> 01:17:28,839
Now,I'm going,your Vasu

757
01:18:09,251 --> 01:18:10,878
Okay,you know Hindi,Isn't it

758
01:18:11,253 --> 01:18:11,878
Little bit

759
01:18:12,087 --> 01:18:14,885
Hey,watch Hindi movies
you'll learn more

760
01:18:15,424 --> 01:18:16,049
Okay,where will you stay?

761
01:18:16,425 --> 01:18:18,052
Actually,you can even
stay with me

762
01:18:18,427 --> 01:18:19,894
Because,I'm absolutely
all alone

763
01:18:20,095 --> 01:18:22,563
I'm a chornic Bachelor
since my birth

764
01:18:22,764 --> 01:18:25,232
Neither wife... nor that...
nor a concubine

765
01:18:28,603 --> 01:18:30,730
Come... this is your room

766
01:18:31,273 --> 01:18:34,071
If you look out from this window
you can see Rama Krishna Theatre

767
01:18:34,443 --> 01:18:35,910
Hey,there's a Telegu movie
playing in it

768
01:18:39,948 --> 01:18:41,074
Don't look through that window

769
01:18:41,283 --> 01:18:43,080
The opposite house's bathroom
is seen

770
01:18:43,618 --> 01:18:45,916
Okay,today you take rest,come
to the office from tomorrow
