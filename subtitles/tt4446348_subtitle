00:00:28,273 --> 00:00:32,136
All events and characters
 in this film are fictitious.

2
00:00:32,337 --> 00:00:35,476
No animals or birds were harmed
in the making of this film.

3
00:00:48,391 --> 00:00:52,254
In memory of those who were awarded death
 penalty for fighting for freedom of mankind.

4
00:01:53,668 --> 00:01:57,530
Our country faces several problems
that need to be addressed.

5
00:01:57,651 --> 00:01:59,541
Garbage and waste is one of it.

6
00:02:00,145 --> 00:02:03,766
This problem has not
 spared even Space.

7
00:02:04,169 --> 00:02:07,629
The annual expenditure for recycling and
management of waste generated in India....

8
00:02:07,629 --> 00:02:10,687
...is about Rs 3000 crore.

9
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:12,618
According to the Basel
Convention treaty...

10
00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:17,286
...every nation should manage
its waste within its boundaries.

11
00:02:17,849 --> 00:02:26,179
Particularly for developed countries, the cost
of exporting a country’s waste to India...

12
00:02:26,299 --> 00:02:31,288
...is lesser than recycling
 toxic waste in their country.

13
00:02:31,771 --> 00:02:33,703
So, without paying heed
to such treaties...

14
00:02:33,703 --> 00:02:40,220
...‘not new goods’ such as electrical
and e-waste and hazardous...

15
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:46,739
...bio-medical waste are
being imported into India.

16
00:02:47,221 --> 00:02:54,183
In the pretext of recyclable metals, used and
 unused bombs, expired ammunition...

17
00:02:54,223 --> 00:03:00,903
...and military waste from rich
nations are dumped in our country.

18
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:11,122
In Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh, while a
woman was dismantling military waste…

19
00:03:11,204 --> 00:03:14,945
...one of the weapons was
still active.

20
00:03:31,442 --> 00:03:33,897
New Delhi

21
00:03:45,283 --> 00:03:49,186
Special Fast Track Court

22
00:04:13,811 --> 00:04:20,853
The charges proven against Balu, head of
the Asian wing of the banned communist outfit, are...

23
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:27,451
...bank robbery and murder, hijacking
and looting a train and...

24
00:04:27,491 --> 00:04:32,923
...mobilising people and ammunition to wipe out
the army and waging war against the State.

25
00:04:33,004 --> 00:04:39,281
Thus, under Sections 121, 122 and 396 of
the Indian Penal Code (IPC),

26
00:04:39,322 --> 00:04:41,735
...the accused stands sentenced
to death on three counts.

27
00:04:43,143 --> 00:04:46,645
Based on the judgments given in the past,
the execution should be such that...

28
00:04:46,645 --> 00:04:50,024
...the convict loses consciousness
immediately through instant death.

29
00:04:50,145 --> 00:04:51,955
There should be no impairment
to his body parts.

30
00:04:52,117 --> 00:04:54,933
The execution should be
conducted in a civilised manner.

31
00:04:54,933 --> 00:04:59,360
For this, the Court recommends
the appointment of...

32
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,020
...a skilled and experienced hangman
for the execution.

33
00:05:03,101 --> 00:05:06,924
As per Indian democratic ethos,
the convict is given reasonable time...

34
00:05:06,924 --> 00:05:10,383
...to plead for mercy
before the execution.

35
00:05:10,383 --> 00:05:14,086
This is the recommendation
of this Special Fast Track Court.

36
00:05:20,201 --> 00:05:21,971
Sir, can I speak in Tamil?

37
00:05:22,777 --> 00:05:26,720
I am not going to plead
for mercy.

38
00:05:27,002 --> 00:05:29,899
I do not consider the charges
levelled against me as offences.

39
00:05:29,939 --> 00:05:32,715
I planned everything and
 executed it in all consciousness.

40
00:05:32,876 --> 00:05:35,249
You are accusing me of waging
a war against the State.

41
00:05:35,532 --> 00:05:42,332
I appeal to the Supreme Court to consider me
as a prisoner of war and shoot me down.

42
00:05:46,999 --> 00:05:50,942
To be shot down or death
by hanging?

43
00:05:51,144 --> 00:05:54,483
Mr. Sivagnanam, what is the update
 on this sensational case?

44
00:05:55,408 --> 00:05:58,869
The Supreme Court has rejected Balu’s plea
 for execution by shooting.

45
00:05:59,312 --> 00:06:02,128
At the same time, the Supreme Court has
announced that the death by hanging sentence...

46
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:04,019
...has to be executed
within 27 days.

47
00:06:04,181 --> 00:06:06,916
Do you have information on where
the hanging will take place?

48
00:06:08,927 --> 00:06:12,912
Since his terrorist movement has penetrated
every nook and corner of India,

49
00:06:12,912 --> 00:06:19,470
...the information about the place of his
execution will not be revealed.

50
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:23,292
But, it is certain that he will be
 hung to death within 27 days.

51
00:06:23,534 --> 00:06:26,914
Balu, who faces death penalty,
has operated under multiple identities...

52
00:06:26,914 --> 00:06:29,610
...and disguises and was involved in various acts
of sabotage across many countries.

53
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:33,231
Several demonstrations were staged
to withdraw the death sentences of...

54
00:06:33,231 --> 00:06:35,122
...Perarivalan, Santhan
and Murugan.

55
00:06:35,162 --> 00:06:37,979
Further, even the legislative assembly
of Tamil Nadu had passed a resolution.

56
00:06:38,018 --> 00:06:42,887
We have with us two eminent personalities to
 debate this death by hanging sentence.

57
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:44,779
Death sentence is not
a punishment.

58
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:46,750
It is a well-planned murder
by the government.

59
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,286
Balu has submitted a plea
 to be shot and executed.

60
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:52,303
Is he instigating the government
 to commit an act of violence?

61
00:06:52,344 --> 00:06:53,027
Wait...

62
00:06:53,228 --> 00:06:57,534
The Indian government will never insist on any
 form of violence even as punishment.

63
00:06:57,655 --> 00:07:01,799
Hang him in a peaceful,
painless and non-violent manner.

64
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:04,736
This is the first time I hear someone say
that death by hanging is non-violent.

65
00:07:05,058 --> 00:07:08,720
The government has to disclose
the identity of the executioner.

66
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,812
That is the most critical aspect
 of this judgment.

67
00:07:11,094 --> 00:07:14,152
An experienced hangman
 will be commissioned.

68
00:07:14,152 --> 00:07:16,003
Who is this experienced hangman?

69
00:07:38,575 --> 00:07:41,231
Balu has to be executed
within 27 days.

70
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:45,495
You have been selected out of
the three officials in your cadre.

71
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:51,089
Everything should be by the law
and the execution as per judgment.

72
00:07:51,451 --> 00:07:53,865
The Media should not have anything
 to find fault with.

73
00:07:53,985 --> 00:07:54,549
They will not.

74
00:07:55,272 --> 00:07:58,372
The public is already celebrating Balu’s
conviction by bursting crackers.

75
00:07:58,372 --> 00:08:01,590
You can’t take advantage of that
and use an amateur hangman.

76
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:05,171
The identity of the hangman in Afzal
 and Kasab’s execution was a secret.

77
00:08:05,171 --> 00:08:06,339
You cannot follow that here.

78
00:08:06,499 --> 00:08:10,281
The details of the hangman and the place
of execution have to be revealed to the Media.

79
00:08:10,443 --> 00:08:13,983
Balu’s group is trying to make him
a martyr like Bhagat Singh.

80
00:08:13,983 --> 00:08:15,030
That is not possible.

81
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:18,691
The documents for ‘Operation Phoenix’
are ready.

82
00:08:18,772 --> 00:08:20,099
Ok, leave.

83
00:08:39,263 --> 00:08:40,470
His name is Yamalingam.

84
00:08:40,591 --> 00:08:43,368
Official records say that in the last execution,
he replaced his father as the hangman.

85
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:45,017
Another interesting thing...

86
00:08:45,782 --> 00:08:48,438
He filed a nomination for the
Indian Presidential elections.

87
00:08:53,185 --> 00:08:54,674
He now works as a
lineman in the Railways.

88
00:08:56,163 --> 00:08:59,342
He is the only experienced
 hangman we have.

89
00:09:07,512 --> 00:09:09,885
Look at what your son is doing.

90
00:09:12,662 --> 00:09:13,828
The train is coming.

91
00:09:15,237 --> 00:09:16,484
Pull the lever.

92
00:09:20,509 --> 00:09:23,848
Pull the lever.

93
00:09:27,429 --> 00:09:29,803
Go to the other side.

94
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:31,171
Wait.

95
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:32,418
Move to the other side.

96
00:09:40,183 --> 00:09:41,753
Pull the lever.

97
00:09:52,255 --> 00:09:53,945
I hope you bought everything
from the ‘Elite’ bar.

98
00:09:53,945 --> 00:09:55,876
It’s all inside the bag.

99
00:09:58,572 --> 00:10:00,302
Why have you bought so little?

100
00:10:00,302 --> 00:10:01,509
I gave you my entire salary.

101
00:10:01,751 --> 00:10:03,682
The salary you earn from
 the government is not enough.

102
00:10:03,884 --> 00:10:05,251
Where is the tapioca
wafers to go with this?

103
00:10:05,251 --> 00:10:08,833
There is a whole lot to
choose from.

104
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:10,361
The woman who sells it is here.

105
00:10:10,402 --> 00:10:11,206
Really?

106
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:26,456
"Oh, grandma…"

107
00:10:26,698 --> 00:10:29,836
"Oh, grandma who sells tapioca
at the street corner…"

108
00:10:29,876 --> 00:10:33,175
"Will you come and dance to
a song I sing in happiness?"

109
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:36,636
"The tea that you’re drinking
from the ‘Nair’s’ tea-shop…"

110
00:10:37,601 --> 00:10:39,935
"What’s that dead and
 floating in it?"

111
00:10:39,935 --> 00:10:41,303
"Is it the fly from
the breakfast cafe? "

112
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,862
"Our wheel rotates
without brakes!"

113
00:10:47,902 --> 00:10:50,920
"Different coloured balloons are
fluttering in my heart."

114
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:54,099
"Big desires come and
salute me."

115
00:10:54,461 --> 00:11:00,898
"The girl smiles, my eyes
 twitch, guns explode."

116
00:11:01,221 --> 00:11:04,480
"'Kalasi’ ‘Kalasi’ the railway ‘Kalasi’."

117
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:07,618
"Let the fun rub off,
 I am going to dance."

118
00:11:14,176 --> 00:11:17,314
"Oh, girl, are you this
grandma’s granddaughter?"

119
00:11:17,355 --> 00:11:20,655
"You keep gaping at me,
are you from the guava grove?"

120
00:11:20,694 --> 00:11:23,874
"Won’t you come close to
 me and coddle me?"

121
00:11:23,914 --> 00:11:26,770
"I can’t bear it!
Can’t sleep at night!"

122
00:11:26,812 --> 00:11:30,391
"To forget that worry,
I drink every night!"

123
00:11:30,513 --> 00:11:33,610
"Eat heavy, drink light."

124
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:38,963
"I have many troubles too,
 my man!"

125
00:11:39,686 --> 00:11:43,629
"Do I use that as an excuse
 and drink like you?"

126
00:11:45,078 --> 00:11:47,533
"Do I chew tobacco like you?"

127
00:11:48,297 --> 00:11:50,792
"Smoke like you?"

128
00:11:51,315 --> 00:11:56,868
"I am a woman! And alone
 I balance my life."

129
00:11:56,868 --> 00:11:58,195
"Ain’t I right?"

130
00:11:58,235 --> 00:12:01,374
"Like grandma,
like granddaughter!"

131
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:20,769
"Life is like an empty box,
there’s no one to question."

132
00:12:20,808 --> 00:12:24,148
"When I drink I speak profoundly."

133
00:12:24,228 --> 00:12:27,528
"Death will come on its own.
Why should it come wrongly?"

134
00:12:27,568 --> 00:12:30,546
"Should Man kill Man?"

135
00:12:30,867 --> 00:12:36,943
"What Lord Krishna said in the Gita, this brother
 will tell you in drunken stupor, listen."

136
00:12:37,305 --> 00:12:44,587
"Who runs this puppet
show called life? Tell me."

137
00:12:45,513 --> 00:12:48,612
"You dance aimlessly!"

138
00:12:48,812 --> 00:12:51,830
"I dance for money!"

139
00:12:55,050 --> 00:13:00,240
"After six in the evening all
of Tamil Nadu dances."

140
00:13:01,327 --> 00:13:05,793
"Tired after a day’s work, the masses
seek the liquor shop."

141
00:13:06,597 --> 00:13:12,351
"The family is destroyed,
but the government makes its profit."

142
00:13:12,915 --> 00:13:18,789
"When you drink that damned
thing your insides burn out."

143
00:13:19,634 --> 00:13:23,054
"Give your life to save your country."

144
00:13:23,054 --> 00:13:26,193
"Oh, grandma who sells tapioca
at the street corner…"

145
00:13:26,233 --> 00:13:29,533
"Will you come and dance to
a song I sing in happiness?"

146
00:13:29,573 --> 00:13:32,992
"The tea that you’re drinking
from the ‘Nair’s’ tea-shop…"

147
00:13:33,757 --> 00:13:36,091
"What’s that dead and
 floating in it?"

148
00:13:36,091 --> 00:13:37,459
"Is it the fly from
the breakfast cafe? "

149
00:13:38,062 --> 00:13:41,322
"'Kalasi’ ‘Kalasi’ the railway ‘Kalasi’."

150
00:13:41,322 --> 00:13:44,420
"Let the fun rub off,
 I am going to dance."

151
00:13:48,162 --> 00:13:49,892
So many bottles in two days!

152
00:13:49,892 --> 00:13:51,582
He spends his salary in
the liquor shop.

153
00:13:51,582 --> 00:13:53,352
At least the bottles can
 earn me some money.

154
00:13:56,129 --> 00:13:57,134
Hello!

155
00:13:57,215 --> 00:13:58,986
Here is your son’s salary.

156
00:13:58,986 --> 00:14:00,152
Is anything left of it?

157
00:14:00,193 --> 00:14:02,889
His salary is barely enough
for his women and wine.

158
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:05,625
How about getting him married
to one of those women?

159
00:14:05,745 --> 00:14:06,992
They are not good women.

160
00:14:07,033 --> 00:14:08,924
Only fate would have
driven them to this.

161
00:14:09,004 --> 00:14:11,860
None of the relatives want to give
their daughter in marriage to him.

162
00:14:11,902 --> 00:14:16,247
If we get him married to one of them,
she will turn a new leaf after marriage.

163
00:14:17,414 --> 00:14:20,673
I am relieved that you
 are taking Balu.

164
00:14:20,914 --> 00:14:21,397
Why?

165
00:14:21,397 --> 00:14:23,087
I will retire in three months.

166
00:14:23,972 --> 00:14:28,238
At my age, it is terrible to
 have someone’s blood on my hands.

167
00:14:29,082 --> 00:14:31,778
I intend to begin my stint
 in prison with his hanging.

168
00:14:45,258 --> 00:14:47,431
Are the files ready?
– Yes.

169
00:14:55,558 --> 00:14:56,966
I’ve seen you in many disguises.

170
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:00,909
So, this is the real you?

171
00:15:17,609 --> 00:15:19,419
By law, one should not be
handcuffed while travelling.

172
00:15:20,626 --> 00:15:29,518
Central Government, hang
 traitor Balu immediately!

173
00:15:34,185 --> 00:15:36,318
You claim you are giving your
life fighting for people.

174
00:15:36,318 --> 00:15:39,657
But, they are protesting that
your life be taken immediately.

175
00:15:40,582 --> 00:15:43,278
What you see here does not represent
 the entire Indian population.

176
00:15:45,773 --> 00:15:46,699
Turn left.

177
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,147
That route does not take
 us to the airport.

178
00:15:48,269 --> 00:15:50,159
I know. Turn left.

179
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,528
That route is not secure.

180
00:15:51,648 --> 00:15:53,015
Just do what I say.

181
00:15:53,297 --> 00:15:55,349
My men will be on every
 route that you take.

182
00:16:11,806 --> 00:16:13,054
Are we travelling by a helicopter?

183
00:16:13,094 --> 00:16:15,347
Many important people have been
 killed in helicopter crashes.

184
00:16:15,468 --> 00:16:16,756
What is the guarantee for
my life?

185
00:16:16,795 --> 00:16:19,250
Even military helicopters are
compromised because of scams.

186
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:20,498
You are just the Police.

187
00:16:20,537 --> 00:16:21,302
Get in.

188
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:24,602
You are doing a test drive
 at the expense of my life.

189
00:16:58,763 --> 00:16:59,768
Kuyili is coming.

190
00:17:04,194 --> 00:17:05,643
Hello!

191
00:17:05,885 --> 00:17:09,224
We got to know about this abandoned
theme park through a fellow member.

192
00:17:09,224 --> 00:17:12,201
This is going to be our hideout.
Let us go in.

193
00:17:28,216 --> 00:17:29,986
This is Vishwa from the
 district committee.

194
00:17:30,107 --> 00:17:32,763
I remember meeting you
 at the Patna congress.

195
00:17:32,963 --> 00:17:33,768
This is Naveen.

196
00:17:34,573 --> 00:17:35,780
They both belong to the
 computer wing.

197
00:17:36,504 --> 00:17:38,557
She is Kuyili from the
 central committee.

198
00:17:41,735 --> 00:17:42,419
Hello!

199
00:17:44,954 --> 00:17:45,759
I am Vetri.

200
00:17:47,206 --> 00:17:49,461
This is the team that is
going to help Balu escape.

201
00:17:49,742 --> 00:17:50,828
We have kept it confidential.

202
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:54,087
Only the headquarters and
 the five of us know about your arrival.

203
00:17:54,651 --> 00:17:57,830
I have gathered information about
the new prison-in-charge Macaulay...

204
00:17:57,991 --> 00:18:01,532
...and the hangman
Yamalingam.

205
00:18:01,774 --> 00:18:06,682
Classifieds reveal that Macaulay has undergone
 six months training with Mossad, Israel.

206
00:18:07,365 --> 00:18:08,895
He can handle any
assignment, big or small.

207
00:18:08,934 --> 00:18:11,430
We have to target the hangman
Yamalingam immediately.

208
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:12,556
What are you saying?

209
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:13,884
Why should we kill Yamalingam?

210
00:18:13,925 --> 00:18:15,614
Our plan was to help Balu escape.

211
00:18:15,776 --> 00:18:16,781
There is no other way out.

212
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:18,069
We have to kill Yamalingam.

213
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:20,442
That is the only way to
stall the hanging.

214
00:18:21,086 --> 00:18:23,944
It is only after that can we work
on an escape plan for Balu.

215
00:18:22,182 --> 00:18:25,279
Kalahasti, Andhra Pradesh

216
00:19:26,242 --> 00:19:27,651
It is my right to escape.

217
00:19:27,651 --> 00:19:29,460
If I want to, I can escape
 even now.

218
00:19:29,782 --> 00:19:31,753
And it is routine for you
to shoot.

219
00:19:33,843 --> 00:19:36,738
I’ll run.
Will you shoot me?

220
00:19:37,824 --> 00:19:39,595
Why don’t you kill me in
 an ‘encounter’?

221
00:19:40,398 --> 00:19:42,972
None of you have the guts
 to shoot me.

222
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,109
We are of the same age.

223
00:19:46,712 --> 00:19:48,522
I have the same guts
you have.

224
00:19:50,331 --> 00:19:52,221
But I am a law-abiding police
 officer.

225
00:19:52,462 --> 00:19:55,196
It is my job to protect the country
 from criminals like you.

226
00:19:56,805 --> 00:19:58,936
We are not murderers.

227
00:19:58,977 --> 00:20:00,465
We too have a Court of law.

228
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:04,365
If you do something wrong, we’ll arrest
you and question you in Court.

229
00:20:04,447 --> 00:20:09,031
If our Court sentences you to death,
we’ll deal with you the very same way.

230
00:20:09,031 --> 00:20:10,479
I will get away somehow.

231
00:20:10,479 --> 00:20:11,362
Wait and watch.

232
00:20:16,228 --> 00:20:17,877
Central Prison, Chennai.

233
00:20:20,854 --> 00:20:22,302
That’s enough, leave now.

234
00:20:22,461 --> 00:20:25,639
Move…

235
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:27,810
The officers are on their way.

236
00:20:28,011 --> 00:20:30,665
Everyone get back to your cells.

237
00:20:31,027 --> 00:20:32,474
What’s your name?
– Ramamurthy.

238
00:20:32,555 --> 00:20:33,400
Go in.

239
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:35,571
What’s your name
 – Annamalai.

240
00:20:36,214 --> 00:20:37,141
Go on.

241
00:20:56,282 --> 00:21:00,624
Even the Prime Minister has a smaller
security cover than I do.

242
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,930
This is Balu’s Tihar prison record.

243
00:21:35,048 --> 00:21:37,500
Verify the records and file them.

244
00:21:49,202 --> 00:21:51,615
Allot a cell in the high
security block.

245
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:18,197
Do you know who he is?

246
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,213
He is the fiery communist
leader, Balu.

247
00:22:21,574 --> 00:22:22,821
He has been charged for
attacking the army.

248
00:22:22,821 --> 00:22:24,470
He’s supposed to be hanged
 here.

249
00:22:53,947 --> 00:22:55,676
They are beating me up.

250
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,167
You are not supposed to
 hit prisoners.

251
00:23:05,247 --> 00:23:06,976
The Court has already
punished him.

252
00:23:07,057 --> 00:23:08,304
Why are you punishing him again?

253
00:23:08,384 --> 00:23:09,710
We are following the rules
of the prison.

254
00:23:09,872 --> 00:23:11,802
He has tried to escape seven times.

255
00:23:11,923 --> 00:23:14,979
In his eighth attempt, he attacked
and injured police officers.

256
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:17,150
We are following the prison
 manual.

257
00:23:17,874 --> 00:23:20,568
We are allowed to beat them
 for what they do in prison.

258
00:23:20,769 --> 00:23:22,338
That is why we gave him
a light beating.

259
00:23:22,579 --> 00:23:24,509
As per the Geneva Convention,
you are not supposed to hit prisoners.

260
00:23:24,549 --> 00:23:25,997
Refer to the new manual.

261
00:23:26,077 --> 00:23:28,450
We are not supposed to hit them,
but we can punish them.

262
00:23:29,093 --> 00:23:31,346
Going by the new manual,
 cut his ration.

263
00:23:31,747 --> 00:23:33,759
Keep him in solitary
confinement for 15 days.

264
00:23:40,404 --> 00:23:42,294
Warden, why are they
standing outside?

265
00:23:42,938 --> 00:23:44,103
Lock them up.

266
00:23:55,846 --> 00:23:59,466
Even though you are a prisoner
sentenced to death, you can step out…

267
00:24:00,511 --> 00:24:02,924
I give you permission to be
 just like the rest of them.

268
00:24:02,965 --> 00:24:04,815
That is a right given by the
Indian Constitution.

269
00:24:05,498 --> 00:24:07,990
The date for executing my death sentence
has not been scheduled.

270
00:24:10,806 --> 00:24:12,213
I will schedule it soon.

271
00:24:14,225 --> 00:24:17,522
I want some books to read
and a table and chair to write.

272
00:24:17,522 --> 00:24:20,176
You are going to die in a few days.
What are you going to write before that?

273
00:24:20,176 --> 00:24:22,829
Everyone’s going to die.
 Won’t you die?

274
00:24:23,996 --> 00:24:26,530
What we do before we die is
 more important.

275
00:24:28,902 --> 00:24:30,632
Take care of his requirements.

276
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:54,117
Why do you come drunk
 to work?

277
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:56,207
What if you fall and hurt
yourself?

278
00:24:57,574 --> 00:24:58,017
You live a good life!

279
00:24:58,017 --> 00:24:59,625
I will go away and die.

280
00:25:00,913 --> 00:25:02,481
Why should you die?

281
00:25:02,883 --> 00:25:04,370
Don’t go.

282
00:25:04,571 --> 00:25:06,140
I am a burden to you.

283
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,105
I’ll die.

284
00:25:07,266 --> 00:25:08,393
You be happy.

285
00:25:13,902 --> 00:25:15,590
Wait, why are you doing this?

286
00:25:18,044 --> 00:25:20,737
You’ve been doing this for
 the last 15 years.

287
00:25:20,778 --> 00:25:23,070
Why do you do this?

288
00:25:32,561 --> 00:25:34,611
Boys, help me.

289
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:44,464
We could have killed him.

290
00:25:45,068 --> 00:25:46,153
His mother is here.

291
00:25:46,193 --> 00:25:47,722
We’re not mercenaries.

292
00:25:49,571 --> 00:25:50,858
Let’s go.

293
00:25:53,391 --> 00:25:56,850
Your relatives are here to file
 petitions for you.

294
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:58,820
Come in one by one as I call
 out your names.

295
00:26:04,168 --> 00:26:06,260
The public prosecutor has not
come here for the last three years...

296
00:26:06,542 --> 00:26:08,632
...to address the concerns
 of death row prisoners.

297
00:26:08,713 --> 00:26:11,246
Balu is writing a petition to
 make him come here.

298
00:26:13,177 --> 00:26:17,076
My mercy plea has not got any response
for the last 18 years.

299
00:26:17,198 --> 00:26:20,937
The review application has just gone to the
Constitutional Bench for re-consideration.

300
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:23,150
I don’t know what the
response will be.

301
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:25,965
I am dying every day wondering
what the outcome will be.

302
00:26:26,004 --> 00:26:27,613
I think this boy will get
caught in a similar trap.

303
00:26:27,694 --> 00:26:31,474
He’s been sentenced to death in the train
derailment case for something...

304
00:26:31,474 --> 00:26:33,725
...as trivial as buying a pen
 for them.

305
00:26:33,807 --> 00:26:34,892
I am very scared.

306
00:26:34,931 --> 00:26:36,501
Balu, why didn’t you appeal
 for mercy?

307
00:26:36,741 --> 00:26:39,195
You asked to be shot.
Is it because it will be less painful?

308
00:26:40,321 --> 00:26:42,975
It is because of my political stand.

309
00:26:43,055 --> 00:26:44,946
All death penalties are horrific.

310
00:26:44,986 --> 00:26:46,031
There are many methods.

311
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:49,650
Stoning to death, beheading,
 lethal injections…

312
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:50,856
I am scared of lethal injections.

313
00:26:50,977 --> 00:26:52,706
A man in America was administered
 a lethal injection.

314
00:26:52,786 --> 00:26:54,315
He suffered for two hours
before he succumbed.

315
00:26:54,396 --> 00:26:57,733
Won’t an electric chair give
 you quick death?

316
00:26:57,733 --> 00:26:58,940
It’s not that easy.

317
00:26:59,382 --> 00:27:02,358
Even at the time of Thomas Alva Edison,
that method was a failure.

318
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:05,454
Did the man who invented
the bulb make that chair too?

319
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:07,505
Put your signature there.

320
00:27:08,108 --> 00:27:09,918
Not all inventions were meant
for the betterment of mankind.

321
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,451
Several inventions are for
 monetary gains.

322
00:27:12,814 --> 00:27:15,025
Shouldn’t the prison hospital be near
the senior citizen’s block?

323
00:27:15,186 --> 00:27:16,594
Isn’t that the basic layout?

324
00:27:16,915 --> 00:27:17,920
Why is it different here?

325
00:27:18,363 --> 00:27:20,736
I don’t know. It’s been this
way ever since I joined.

326
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:24,636
Rahul, move the senior citizen’s
block close to the hospital.

327
00:27:24,877 --> 00:27:26,205
I asked you to call Chellapandi.
What happened?

328
00:27:26,245 --> 00:27:28,376
I’ve been trying since morning.
I am unable to get through to him.

329
00:27:28,818 --> 00:27:29,944
Sit down.

330
00:27:34,167 --> 00:27:35,212
What’s happened to Yamalingam?

331
00:27:35,334 --> 00:27:36,579
He’s right in front of me.

332
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:39,194
On 28th morning, it’s half a bottle,
a full bottle in the evening…

333
00:27:40,119 --> 00:27:42,290
On 29th, it’s a full bottle in
 the morning and evening…

334
00:27:42,331 --> 00:27:43,858
He’s been drunk since morning.

335
00:27:43,899 --> 00:27:44,823
He’s in no state to come.

336
00:27:44,864 --> 00:27:45,788
Where’s the liquor shop?

337
00:27:48,926 --> 00:27:50,453
Why does it say I bought four
 bottles on the 1st?

338
00:27:50,494 --> 00:27:52,102
Where is the food that I ordered?

339
00:27:52,102 --> 00:27:53,671
I am coming.
 He’s torturing me.

340
00:27:54,515 --> 00:27:58,256
I stocked up on the 1st because sale of liquor
is prohibited on 2nd which is Gandhi’s birthday.

341
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:01,593
What do you infer from this?

342
00:28:01,914 --> 00:28:11,044
Drunkards are the only men who think
of great men and their birthdays.

343
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:13,938
Give me a pen.
I need to sign the cheque.

344
00:28:13,978 --> 00:28:16,069
I don’t have a pen.
Give me the money first.

345
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:17,839
He’s a nuisance every
 single day.

346
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:19,247
I am coming.

347
00:28:20,855 --> 00:28:22,303
Help me, sir.

348
00:28:23,509 --> 00:28:24,796
I have an account at the bar.

349
00:28:25,439 --> 00:28:26,887
I have a chequebook with me.

350
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:29,099
I have to settle my dues.

351
00:28:29,984 --> 00:28:31,109
Help me with a pen.

352
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:32,276
Do you have a pen?
– I don’t.

353
00:28:33,121 --> 00:28:34,287
We don’t have a pen.

354
00:28:35,332 --> 00:28:36,458
Aren’t you educated?

355
00:28:36,499 --> 00:28:37,222
I have a Master’s in science.

356
00:28:37,222 --> 00:28:38,187
How did you write your exams?

357
00:28:38,187 --> 00:28:40,078
That is why I don’t like
coming to local bars.

358
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:41,806
The problem is between the
 two of us.

359
00:28:41,967 --> 00:28:43,294
Why do you want to drag the
 bar into it?

360
00:28:43,334 --> 00:28:45,024
I’ve had an account here for
 the last seven years.

361
00:28:45,103 --> 00:28:46,472
Who are you calling a ‘local’?

362
00:28:51,699 --> 00:28:52,382
Is it the police station?

363
00:28:52,624 --> 00:28:54,313
Keep something there to
support the table.

364
00:28:54,795 --> 00:28:55,881
You have your drink in peace.

365
00:28:55,922 --> 00:28:56,846
I’ll take care of it.

366
00:29:01,189 --> 00:29:02,717
This table needs support as well.

367
00:29:04,286 --> 00:29:05,212
Don’t you want a pen?

368
00:29:05,291 --> 00:29:08,509
The two men there seem
to be educated.

369
00:29:08,549 --> 00:29:09,514
They will definitely have
a pen.

370
00:29:09,514 --> 00:29:10,278
Ask them.

371
00:29:11,202 --> 00:29:12,409
Brother…

372
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:15,184
I have two pens.

373
00:29:15,908 --> 00:29:17,194
Which one do you want?

374
00:29:17,234 --> 00:29:18,400
Do you know to read and write?

375
00:29:19,406 --> 00:29:21,215
I have a Doctorate.

376
00:29:21,296 --> 00:29:23,025
You are the God of education.

377
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:25,961
Are you being a nuisance
after your drink?

378
00:29:26,001 --> 00:29:27,530
Don’t I have the freedom
to write?

379
00:29:27,651 --> 00:29:28,616
Our officer will tell you that.

380
00:29:28,655 --> 00:29:32,838
You’ll have to treat me better.
 I am a central government employee.

381
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,124
He is the ADGP.
(Assistant Directorate General of Police)

382
00:29:36,699 --> 00:29:40,318
Which law allows you to arrest me
for signing my own cheque?

383
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,645
Put him into the police van.

384
00:29:42,046 --> 00:29:43,011
Get him into our vehicle.

385
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:48,199
Which police station are
you in charge of?

386
00:29:48,803 --> 00:29:50,612
I am in charge of the prison.

387
00:29:55,519 --> 00:29:56,765
I swear I wasn’t expecting this.

388
00:29:56,765 --> 00:29:59,178
I thought you were going
to beat me up.

389
00:29:59,218 --> 00:30:01,832
But you’ve brought me to
a very classy bar.

390
00:30:01,832 --> 00:30:03,199
You are God!

391
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:07,060
Eat and drink to your heart’s
 content.

392
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,790
Do you have a monthly
account with them?

393
00:30:15,062 --> 00:30:16,108
What’s your name?
– Kasi.

394
00:30:16,108 --> 00:30:17,234
Kasi, bring me more food
and liquor over there.

395
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:18,883
Take care of him.

396
00:30:20,331 --> 00:30:23,065
Bring me a glass of juice and
 leave the rest on that table.

397
00:30:30,143 --> 00:30:31,952
Kasi, a repeat of that.

398
00:30:32,032 --> 00:30:33,923
Leave it beside the recliner.

399
00:30:40,437 --> 00:30:43,011
Kasi is faster than us.
Let’s go there.

400
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:58,614
Lingam, have your drink
 after hearing me out.

401
00:30:58,775 --> 00:31:01,791
I have a policy. I don’t listen while drinking
and I don’t drink while listening.

402
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:07,863
Now tell me.
What’s the matter?

403
00:31:09,673 --> 00:31:11,483
Do you read the newspapers?

404
00:31:12,608 --> 00:31:13,533
I don’t do all that.

405
00:31:13,815 --> 00:31:15,302
It’s only movie news for me.

406
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:19,968
Do you know of the traitor
Balu who attacked our army?

407
00:31:20,007 --> 00:31:20,851
I don’t.

408
00:31:20,933 --> 00:31:22,661
He’s in my custody now.

409
00:31:22,822 --> 00:31:25,235
He attacked the army
 single-handedly.

410
00:31:25,235 --> 00:31:27,930
And if they’ve handed over the accused
to you, you must be great.

411
00:31:28,372 --> 00:31:29,940
He must be hanged.

412
00:31:32,876 --> 00:31:35,047
You are the one who is going
 to hang him.

413
00:31:54,993 --> 00:31:56,441
I am not a murderer.

414
00:31:56,723 --> 00:32:00,141
I can’t murder someone.

415
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,856
What happened, Lingam?

416
00:32:07,339 --> 00:32:08,987
Why are you blabbering?

417
00:32:11,641 --> 00:32:13,130
Lingam, get up.

418
00:32:15,744 --> 00:32:18,961
Listen to me.

419
00:32:20,931 --> 00:32:22,781
I can’t murder someone.

420
00:32:23,425 --> 00:32:26,039
You don’t understand what
I am saying.

421
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:27,285
We will talk later.

422
00:32:31,668 --> 00:32:33,518
Kasi, go.

423
00:32:38,867 --> 00:32:39,389
Drink it.

424
00:32:48,518 --> 00:32:50,810
You don’t get the difference
 between punishment and murder.

425
00:32:51,293 --> 00:32:53,344
Balu conspired to kill several
people.

426
00:32:53,544 --> 00:32:55,313
You are going to punish him
 by hanging him.

427
00:32:55,998 --> 00:32:57,003
Why me, sir?

428
00:32:57,043 --> 00:33:00,341
If we let him go,
he will kill more people.

429
00:33:00,421 --> 00:33:01,909
Let’s talk in the car.

430
00:33:15,542 --> 00:33:16,628
Come here.

431
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:23,866
This is for you.

432
00:33:26,197 --> 00:33:27,486
There’s a mobile phone inside.

433
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:29,416
You can call me whenever
you want.

434
00:33:29,455 --> 00:33:30,863
I will call you tomorrow.

435
00:34:19,521 --> 00:34:21,171
Have dinner and go to bed.

436
00:34:22,015 --> 00:34:23,140
I don’t want to.

437
00:34:50,646 --> 00:34:51,813
Did you meet Yamalingam?

438
00:34:51,813 --> 00:34:52,658
Is everything going smoothly?

439
00:34:52,738 --> 00:34:54,146
Have you finalised the date?

440
00:34:54,186 --> 00:34:55,996
There is a small glitch,
but nothing to worry.

441
00:34:56,075 --> 00:34:59,897
If you ignore something small,
it will turn big.

442
00:35:29,593 --> 00:35:31,318
These gallows were
constructed by the British.

443
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,728
Till now, 586 executions have
 taken place here.

444
00:35:34,009 --> 00:35:36,860
It was Yamalingam who carried out
a death sentence here 12 years back.

445
00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:39,028
Two persons can be hanged
 at the same time.

446
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:40,514
That’s the right thing.

447
00:35:41,277 --> 00:35:42,843
Why haven’t you maintained
 this place?

448
00:35:42,883 --> 00:35:46,256
The earlier prison superintendents
were against capital punishment.

449
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:50,433
How can a person in the police
department be against punishment?

450
00:35:51,075 --> 00:35:52,761
Based on the severity of
 the crime...

451
00:35:52,761 --> 00:35:55,090
...one should cut off a hand  or leg
 or even the head as punishment.

452
00:35:55,813 --> 00:35:58,664
A criminal should be
stoned to death in public.

453
00:35:58,904 --> 00:36:01,756
Hang at least 20 criminals
every day.

454
00:36:01,836 --> 00:36:03,282
Do this for two years.

455
00:36:03,523 --> 00:36:08,623
Let’s see who will then dare murder someone,
molest a child or plant a bomb.

456
00:36:09,225 --> 00:36:11,032
Not one terrorist will be able to
 raise his head again.

457
00:36:11,192 --> 00:36:12,477
Get the gallows ready.

458
00:36:12,477 --> 00:36:14,002
Yamalingam needs to
come here for that.

459
00:36:38,536 --> 00:36:40,103
Wake up.

460
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:45,122
How did you get this
phone?

461
00:36:45,162 --> 00:36:47,250
This police officer has been
 calling since morning.

462
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:47,974
What’s the matter?

463
00:36:47,974 --> 00:36:48,816
What do you want me to say?

464
00:36:50,423 --> 00:36:51,907
They are asking me to hang
someone and commit murder.

465
00:36:52,791 --> 00:36:55,642
The very same job your father
 and grandfather did?

466
00:36:55,723 --> 00:37:00,621
I learnt about your father’s job only
on the day you were born.

467
00:37:00,621 --> 00:37:02,590
I’ve not lived with him
ever since.

468
00:37:08,331 --> 00:37:09,094
That’s enough.

469
00:37:09,215 --> 00:37:12,386
This cursed job that your forefathers
took on, hasn’t spared you either.

470
00:37:16,202 --> 00:37:17,566
Tell me you won’t hang
 anyone.

471
00:37:18,168 --> 00:37:19,454
They won’t let me go.

472
00:37:25,718 --> 00:37:29,533
I begged your father not to take you along to
 the gallows when you were just 18.

473
00:37:29,533 --> 00:37:30,537
He didn’t listen.

474
00:37:30,576 --> 00:37:32,985
He took you along because
 he was not well.

475
00:37:33,106 --> 00:37:37,643
Ever since you executed that hanging,
you were in a daze for over 10 years.

476
00:37:37,684 --> 00:37:39,531
You’re all right only now.

477
00:37:39,852 --> 00:37:41,699
Don’t answer the policeman’s call.

478
00:37:41,699 --> 00:37:42,543
I’ll talk to him.

479
00:37:42,783 --> 00:37:44,109
They insist on hanging people.

480
00:37:44,149 --> 00:37:46,477
He has hanged 84 people so far.

481
00:37:46,477 --> 00:37:48,806
Your father’s last drawn
 salary was Rs 150.

482
00:37:49,729 --> 00:37:53,022
Your grandfather has hanged hundreds
of men in the days of the kings.

483
00:37:53,103 --> 00:37:54,428
What did he get in return?

484
00:37:54,468 --> 00:37:56,757
A hut to stay and some
food to eat…

485
00:37:56,957 --> 00:37:59,366
This job is neither well
paying nor fulfilling.

486
00:37:59,366 --> 00:38:00,491
This is no worthy job.

487
00:38:01,704 --> 00:38:03,028
We don’t need this job.

488
00:38:03,109 --> 00:38:04,112
Switch off your phone.

489
00:38:04,393 --> 00:38:06,441
If you go out, the police
officer will find you.

490
00:38:06,683 --> 00:38:08,370
I’ll lock you inside and
step out to buy groceries.

491
00:38:22,142 --> 00:38:23,507
He usually goes to the
teashop at 5 am.

492
00:38:23,507 --> 00:38:24,672
He hasn’t come out as yet.

493
00:38:24,752 --> 00:38:26,841
His mother has locked him
up and gone out.

494
00:38:27,081 --> 00:38:28,085
Is there a backdoor?

495
00:38:28,085 --> 00:38:29,289
I’ll call you after checking.

496
00:38:29,851 --> 00:38:30,936
What are you cutting out?

497
00:38:31,336 --> 00:38:33,786
We are censoring newspapers
 distributed to the prisoners.

498
00:38:34,068 --> 00:38:35,071
What are you cutting out?

499
00:38:35,353 --> 00:38:37,682
‘Prisoners at the Vellore prison
go on a hunger strike.’

500
00:38:38,926 --> 00:38:40,332
What are you cutting out?

501
00:38:40,854 --> 00:38:42,621
Photos of movie stars.

502
00:38:46,957 --> 00:38:48,684
They look good.
 – Yes, sir.

503
00:38:48,684 --> 00:38:50,008
Haven’t we seen them?
 -Yes, sir.

504
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:52,137
Let them see it too. Send them over
without cutting anything out.

505
00:38:52,338 --> 00:38:53,622
This is not censorship for cinema.

506
00:38:53,984 --> 00:38:56,032
People here have a different
set of problems.

507
00:38:56,715 --> 00:38:59,204
‘Government files a petition in the
Supreme Court seeking to review...

508
00:38:59,245 --> 00:39:00,891
...its earlier judgment on
 homosexuality.’

509
00:39:01,051 --> 00:39:03,541
They’ve been prisoners for
 10-15 years.

510
00:39:03,581 --> 00:39:04,945
Will other people understand
 their problems?

511
00:39:05,588 --> 00:39:09,483
Why should we follow what the Englishman,
Macaulay wrote 150 years back?

512
00:39:10,167 --> 00:39:12,254
The central government has sent
an appeal to the Supreme Court.

513
00:39:12,294 --> 00:39:13,378
Send it to them without
cutting these out.

514
00:39:13,619 --> 00:39:14,663
I am a ‘Macaulay’ too.

515
00:39:14,744 --> 00:39:16,952
I am Chellapandi.
 Can I speak to our officer?

516
00:39:19,001 --> 00:39:19,924
Yes, Chellapandi.

517
00:39:20,325 --> 00:39:22,333
I brought along
Yamalingam’s mother.

518
00:39:22,814 --> 00:39:24,300
Bring her to the office.

519
00:39:26,027 --> 00:39:26,990
Please come in.

520
00:39:32,451 --> 00:39:33,977
Sit down.
The officer will be here.

521
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:37,992
It is best you agree to do
 what he asks you to do.

522
00:39:38,434 --> 00:39:39,278
All right.

523
00:39:48,834 --> 00:39:49,678
Please sit down.

524
00:39:54,898 --> 00:39:56,504
What did Lingam say?
All Ok?

525
00:39:56,585 --> 00:40:00,037
He’s very scared.
 He seems to be in a state of shock.

526
00:40:00,921 --> 00:40:02,126
Please let him go.

527
00:40:13,047 --> 00:40:13,649
Please sit down.

528
00:40:16,982 --> 00:40:17,825
Please sit down.

529
00:40:21,881 --> 00:40:24,050
Think of me as your son.

530
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:26,499
Lingam will be fine if he
 listens to me.

531
00:40:26,619 --> 00:40:29,992
I’ll ensure he gets a permanent job in
the government with a good salary.

532
00:40:30,032 --> 00:40:32,521
He can get married and
have a good life after that.

533
00:40:32,603 --> 00:40:34,490
Ask him to hang Balu.

534
00:40:39,789 --> 00:40:46,094
Can you please make a recommendation to
 the government, I will hang Balu.

535
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:53,162
If that were possible,
I would hang him myself.

536
00:40:54,125 --> 00:40:56,816
If he does what I tell him
 to do, he’ll be fine.

537
00:40:57,297 --> 00:40:59,506
Else, you know what the
 police can do.

538
00:41:00,068 --> 00:41:03,160
Don’t worry.
Ask Lingam to meet me.

539
00:41:06,774 --> 00:41:09,905
Lingam’s mother is
coming down.

540
00:41:10,147 --> 00:41:11,431
Take her to her house.

541
00:41:11,431 --> 00:41:12,194
Yes, sir.

542
00:41:30,746 --> 00:41:31,910
You were right.

543
00:41:31,991 --> 00:41:33,436
He will not let go of you.

544
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:39,057
I gave it some thought.

545
00:41:39,178 --> 00:41:43,435
Neither your father nor your grandfather
were happy about hanging people.

546
00:41:43,474 --> 00:41:46,928
Trust God and just obey
 the prison official’s orders.

547
00:41:48,774 --> 00:41:50,059
We pray to so many Gods.

548
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:51,746
Why does God test the faithful?

549
00:41:51,786 --> 00:41:55,399
Different Gods have asked
 for different sacrifices.

550
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:58,010
Why don’t you believe that this
is the sacrifice God wants of you?

551
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:06,724
How can poor people like us
go against the government?

552
00:42:07,004 --> 00:42:09,413
Just do what the officer
tells you to do.

553
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:18,528
See if you can fall asleep
after drinking this.

554
00:42:30,615 --> 00:42:32,462
Son, I am innocent.

555
00:42:33,867 --> 00:42:35,112
Believe me.

556
00:43:13,098 --> 00:43:13,940
Are you done?

557
00:43:14,182 --> 00:43:15,829
Lingam is going somewhere
 holding a suitcase.

558
00:43:15,909 --> 00:43:18,037
Whatever happens, we shouldn’t
miss him this time.

559
00:43:18,117 --> 00:43:19,683
Give me an update about the
route as you follow him.

560
00:43:19,724 --> 00:43:20,486
I’ll be there.

561
00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:27,714
He’s going past the
graveyard.

562
00:43:27,714 --> 00:43:28,839
We’re following him.

563
00:43:35,022 --> 00:43:36,026
I’ve come to the graveyard.

564
00:43:36,307 --> 00:43:38,033
If you go past that,
you’ll find a pond.

565
00:43:38,074 --> 00:43:39,238
You’ll see a temple after that.

566
00:43:39,319 --> 00:43:41,085
We’re waiting there. Come.

567
00:43:53,252 --> 00:43:54,898
You seem very happy.

568
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:56,103
What do you care?

569
00:43:56,464 --> 00:43:58,472
You get blood as offering
 everyday!

570
00:43:59,918 --> 00:44:01,846
It looks like someone has
 offered a hen as sacrifice.

571
00:44:02,688 --> 00:44:04,576
But I am the only one who has
offered you a human sacrifice.

572
00:44:05,339 --> 00:44:09,113
Not just me, all my ancestors
have done the same thing.

573
00:44:09,194 --> 00:44:10,719
We offered blood before
every hanging.

574
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:12,446
You took it all.

575
00:44:13,049 --> 00:44:14,132
What should you have done?

576
00:44:14,413 --> 00:44:15,819
You should have blessed
me with a boon.

577
00:44:17,224 --> 00:44:21,681
But you cursed instead.

578
00:44:32,482 --> 00:44:34,811
I’ve decided to make one
 more human sacrifice.

579
00:44:36,859 --> 00:44:39,027
This is the last one,
but it’s special.

580
00:44:42,609 --> 00:44:45,178
Do you know who you are
 trampling on?

581
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:46,223
That’s me.

582
00:44:46,504 --> 00:44:48,271
You’re trampling on me.

583
00:44:48,551 --> 00:44:49,596
Just see what I do to you.

584
00:45:02,887 --> 00:45:05,257
You are my mother.
You should be around.

585
00:45:07,545 --> 00:45:11,198
I told you.
I told the policeman.

586
00:45:11,841 --> 00:45:13,086
I told my mother.

587
00:45:14,852 --> 00:45:15,937
No one listened.

588
00:45:23,847 --> 00:45:27,340
Why are you staring with
 your saucer-eyes?

589
00:45:28,746 --> 00:45:31,397
I cannot offer another human
sacrifice and turn crazy after that.

590
00:45:31,397 --> 00:45:33,604
I just cannot do that.

591
00:45:37,098 --> 00:45:38,543
That is why I’ve decided
 to give up my life.

592
00:45:39,868 --> 00:45:41,193
My poor mother….

593
00:45:42,077 --> 00:45:44,326
I don’t know how she’s going to manage,
that too with a limp.

594
00:45:47,216 --> 00:45:49,827
Mother!

595
00:45:50,268 --> 00:45:52,598
Let them hang any number
 of people they want.

596
00:45:52,598 --> 00:45:54,726
Let anyone hang them.

597
00:45:54,726 --> 00:45:56,974
It doesn’t matter to me.

598
00:45:59,785 --> 00:46:02,877
I’ll hang myself right in
front of you. Take me.

599
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:10,145
Is it the Goddess talking?

600
00:46:13,197 --> 00:46:13,879
Let me go.

601
00:46:14,883 --> 00:46:16,248
Won’t you even let me die
 in peace?

602
00:46:16,248 --> 00:46:17,654
Did you send them?
Who are they?

603
00:46:18,257 --> 00:46:19,942
We are Balu’s people.

604
00:46:24,279 --> 00:46:25,764
You must not die,
 Yamalingam.

605
00:46:26,849 --> 00:46:28,214
I must die.

606
00:46:30,462 --> 00:46:32,671
If I stay alive, the police officer
will ensure I hang him.

607
00:46:32,711 --> 00:46:35,121
You are not a kid for them
 to force you to do it.

608
00:46:35,522 --> 00:46:38,212
It’s Macaulay who is pleading
with you to do this.

609
00:46:38,574 --> 00:46:40,862
He is the one who needs you.

610
00:46:40,942 --> 00:46:42,790
I’ll take your words to be
 my Goddess’ words.

611
00:46:43,072 --> 00:46:45,320
I will go right away and tell the
police officer I will not hang him.

612
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:47,448
Don’t be in a hurry.

613
00:46:47,769 --> 00:46:49,254
Do what I say.

614
00:46:51,182 --> 00:46:51,664
Come.

615
00:46:54,997 --> 00:46:56,523
Get on the bike.

616
00:47:15,556 --> 00:47:17,081
No one can harm you.

617
00:47:17,403 --> 00:47:18,446
You are not alone.

618
00:47:18,487 --> 00:47:20,936
We’re with you.

619
00:47:30,172 --> 00:47:31,296
Hope you’ve made note.

620
00:47:34,186 --> 00:47:35,752
After meeting Yamalingam
 yesterday...

621
00:47:36,034 --> 00:47:38,363
I’ve been thinking about using him
 for Balu’s escape plan.

622
00:47:38,403 --> 00:47:41,053
How will he agree to help us
on such a risky venture?

623
00:47:41,576 --> 00:47:44,989
The three prisoners who were supposed to help
us have been shifted to another prison.

624
00:47:45,389 --> 00:47:46,514
I got that information just today.

625
00:47:46,916 --> 00:47:48,844
That could be a part of
Macaulay’s plan.

626
00:47:49,084 --> 00:47:51,774
Balu is the only one who can have
 access to Yamalingam.

627
00:47:52,096 --> 00:47:54,063
I’ll work on convincing
Yamalingam.

628
00:47:54,345 --> 00:47:55,308
You work on the escape plan.

629
00:47:55,428 --> 00:47:57,556
Please try your best to forward my
case to the Supreme Court.

630
00:47:57,758 --> 00:47:58,399
Public Prosecutor...

631
00:47:58,761 --> 00:48:01,131
Nothing can be done without
the case documents.

632
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:03,420
I will write a letter to the High Court
requesting for the case documents.

633
00:48:03,781 --> 00:48:06,631
Please put in a request for a local
branch of the Supreme Court.

634
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:16,871
Calling Arumugam from Vaiputtampatti
village, Krishnagiri District.

635
00:48:18,557 --> 00:48:19,722
How many years have you
 spent in this prison?

636
00:48:19,722 --> 00:48:20,766
Twelve years.

637
00:48:20,805 --> 00:48:21,689
What was the offence you
 committed?

638
00:48:21,689 --> 00:48:24,581
I raped and killed a 14-year- old
 girl and burnt the body.

639
00:48:24,581 --> 00:48:25,343
Really?

640
00:48:25,383 --> 00:48:27,150
Yes, I have enacted the scene a
number of times in the courtroom.

641
00:48:27,150 --> 00:48:28,235
Shall I enact it for you?

642
00:48:28,235 --> 00:48:29,278
Not required.

643
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:32,972
The sub-inspector who filed a false case
against you committed suicide.

644
00:48:33,213 --> 00:48:38,353
His suicide note says you were innocent
and that it was just an allegation.

645
00:48:38,353 --> 00:48:43,172
The ex-city commissioner, Nandakumar Choutala,
has also admitted to have pressurised the inspector.

646
00:48:43,373 --> 00:48:44,497
Balu, come up.

647
00:48:44,657 --> 00:48:49,717
It was Balu who gathered all the
details and helped in your release.

648
00:48:49,957 --> 00:48:56,383
Therefore, as per law, Arumugam is found
‘Not Guilty’ and is accordingly acquitted.

649
00:49:12,404 --> 00:49:17,544
Arumugam’s wages for the last 12 years of work
done in prison is Rs 3,60,000.

650
00:49:19,431 --> 00:49:20,675
Take it.

651
00:49:29,027 --> 00:49:31,839
Unable to bear the disgrace of
the rape charge levelled on me,

652
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:33,525
...my wife and daughter
 committed suicide.

653
00:49:34,208 --> 00:49:36,015
I am now declared
innocent and released.

654
00:49:36,055 --> 00:49:38,905
Can this government now
 bring back my family?

655
00:49:38,905 --> 00:49:39,990
I am now an orphan.

656
00:49:41,355 --> 00:49:43,283
I don’t want to leave this place.

657
00:49:43,283 --> 00:49:44,728
I’ll stay here.

658
00:49:49,788 --> 00:49:54,084
I believe you filed a nomination to
contest the Presidential elections.

659
00:49:57,906 --> 00:50:00,877
I was feeling bad about
hanging a person.

660
00:50:01,601 --> 00:50:07,543
That’s when one of my friends suggested that if
I became the President of the country…

661
00:50:07,864 --> 00:50:12,160
I could accept all the mercy pleas received and
 abolish capital punishment once and for all.

662
00:50:13,085 --> 00:50:15,092
I thought it was a good idea
and sent in an application.

663
00:50:15,614 --> 00:50:16,819
But they rejected it.

664
00:50:19,148 --> 00:50:21,837
Tell me who supports a good
 cause the way you do.

665
00:50:26,331 --> 00:50:27,536
What about the hangman
 Yamalingam.

666
00:50:27,536 --> 00:50:28,499
I’ve given him some time.

667
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:29,824
There’s no time.

668
00:50:30,266 --> 00:50:32,515
The Media will question me.

669
00:50:32,716 --> 00:50:35,847
We have to submit proof of an experienced
hangman executing the sentence.

670
00:50:36,009 --> 00:50:40,144
You have to shoot a video of
Yamalingam hanging Balu.

671
00:50:40,666 --> 00:50:43,718
We might have to send it to
the Prime Minister’s Office.

672
00:50:44,039 --> 00:50:46,930
We have to get Yamalingam
to agree to hang Balu.

673
00:50:50,705 --> 00:50:52,953
Hurry! The body should
 be out before roll call.

674
00:50:59,137 --> 00:51:01,466
The old man Tamilmaran
 is dead.

675
00:51:01,586 --> 00:51:04,839
They are taking his body in
an ambulance without anyone’s knowledge.

676
00:51:07,288 --> 00:51:09,336
Come on, everyone.

677
00:51:13,431 --> 00:51:15,641
This is Syed on line.
 – Tell me.

678
00:51:15,721 --> 00:51:18,050
The prisoners are
marching agitatedly.

679
00:51:18,090 --> 00:51:19,576
Allow them to come
towards my room.

680
00:51:19,897 --> 00:51:20,700
I’ll handle it.

681
00:51:34,393 --> 00:51:36,240
Could the police have
 tortured him?

682
00:52:01,978 --> 00:52:04,187
Stop the vehicle!

683
00:52:28,882 --> 00:52:30,246
Has he become your leader?

684
00:52:30,366 --> 00:52:32,616
We’ve accepted him as our leader
because he is worthy.

685
00:52:32,937 --> 00:52:35,105
The government has appointed
 me as prison in-charge.

686
00:52:35,306 --> 00:52:35,908
I can do what I want.

687
00:52:35,908 --> 00:52:37,273
They’ve even given me a pistol.

688
00:52:37,435 --> 00:52:38,799
Will you shoot us?

689
00:52:42,373 --> 00:52:46,067
Do you think I am scared to shoot,
 because I’ll lose my job?

690
00:52:46,590 --> 00:52:48,115
I am not scared of anything.

691
00:52:48,638 --> 00:52:50,002
Neither am I scared of anything.

692
00:52:51,729 --> 00:52:53,697
I am going to be in this
prison till I die.

693
00:52:55,664 --> 00:52:57,632
I am the one who is fearless.

694
00:52:58,716 --> 00:53:01,366
Do you think you are a big thug because
you’ve murdered a few people?

695
00:53:01,366 --> 00:53:03,173
You’re the one who’s
acting like one.

696
00:53:10,361 --> 00:53:13,612
When we come to ask you for something,
you’re pointing your gun at us.

697
00:53:14,617 --> 00:53:17,467
You’ve lodged 3000 people in a prison that
has the capacity to lodge just 2000.

698
00:53:18,672 --> 00:53:20,118
The dead man was 84
years old.

699
00:53:20,399 --> 00:53:22,206
Taking his age and illness
 into consideration...

700
00:53:22,286 --> 00:53:25,499
....even you could have set him free
as per Prison Rule Number 632.

701
00:53:31,842 --> 00:53:33,128
What do you all know?

702
00:53:34,052 --> 00:53:35,859
Anantharaman, tell them.

703
00:53:35,979 --> 00:53:38,589
For the last 15 years, no one has
 even submitted a plea to see him.

704
00:53:38,910 --> 00:53:42,323
No one from his party came
to his aid nor did they seek his release.

705
00:53:42,443 --> 00:53:44,653
We took care of him till
 he died.

706
00:53:44,812 --> 00:53:48,065
We are only doing what we should
legally do with an unclaimed body.

707
00:53:48,787 --> 00:53:49,591
Give way.

708
00:53:50,755 --> 00:53:52,040
He is not an unclaimed body.

709
00:53:52,201 --> 00:53:56,055
He struggled for Tamils, lived
and breathed his last in prison for that.

710
00:53:56,055 --> 00:53:57,100
He’s a martyr.

711
00:53:57,180 --> 00:53:59,388
We’ll conduct his last rites.

712
00:53:59,870 --> 00:54:00,955
The law doesn’t allow that.

713
00:54:00,995 --> 00:54:02,561
You’ve learnt the law
 to come here.

714
00:54:02,681 --> 00:54:04,649
But we’ve come here and
 learnt the law.

715
00:54:05,813 --> 00:54:07,982
Please have a humane approach.

716
00:54:08,102 --> 00:54:13,000
If I want to, I can shoot down 10 of
you and make it appear legal.

717
00:54:13,202 --> 00:54:14,326
But I am not doing that.

718
00:54:14,446 --> 00:54:20,309
On humanitarian grounds, I’ll agree to your
request of conducting his last rites here.

719
00:54:21,032 --> 00:54:21,915
Make arrangements.

720
00:54:30,789 --> 00:54:32,355
The post-mortem report
has come.

721
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:33,840
Mr. Macaulay has signed the papers
as the prison in-charge.

722
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:35,247
You sign it too.

723
00:54:36,531 --> 00:54:37,736
Please sit down and sign it.

724
00:54:54,882 --> 00:54:56,166
Fellow prisoners!

725
00:54:58,294 --> 00:55:02,431
Late Tamilmaran came into this
 prison as a 24-year-old youngster.

726
00:55:02,832 --> 00:55:04,559
He is known to all of you.

727
00:55:05,201 --> 00:55:06,807
He fought for the Tamils.

728
00:55:07,008 --> 00:55:08,815
He was shot at in an
encounter with the police.

729
00:55:09,217 --> 00:55:13,634
Because he revolted, he was trapped in a
conspiracy and died here serving a life sentence.

730
00:55:13,874 --> 00:55:18,692
The prisoners or even the police officers here
understand the agony of serving a life sentence.

731
00:55:18,974 --> 00:55:23,551
Late Tamilmaran has written a book,
‘Computers and the Tamil Language.’

732
00:55:23,752 --> 00:55:25,760
The manuscript is available
in the prison library.

733
00:55:26,804 --> 00:55:28,330
I don’t know if I will live
 to do this.

734
00:55:28,812 --> 00:55:35,718
But those getting released from prison must take the
 manuscript from Mr. Macaulay and publish it.

735
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:37,846
That is the best way to pay
 homage to him.

736
00:55:38,087 --> 00:55:40,015
What I like best of what
 Tamilmaran has said…

737
00:55:40,617 --> 00:55:47,002
‘No freedom struggle is complete without
considering class considerations.’

738
00:55:48,567 --> 00:55:50,415
You light the pyre.

739
00:56:02,761 --> 00:56:03,727
Let me wash that for you.

740
00:56:03,727 --> 00:56:04,211
No, that’s all right.

741
00:56:04,331 --> 00:56:06,023
Everyone is talking about you.

742
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:07,754
Everybody likes you.

743
00:56:07,834 --> 00:56:09,123
You shouldn’t die.

744
00:56:10,331 --> 00:56:12,665
I know every nook and
corner of this prison.

745
00:56:12,867 --> 00:56:16,088
This old man has access
 even to Macaulay’s room.

746
00:56:16,249 --> 00:56:18,423
Nobody will question him.

747
00:56:18,826 --> 00:56:20,115
He has that good a reputation.

748
00:56:20,356 --> 00:56:23,618
Only after his consent,
did we plot out an escape plan.

749
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:25,630
You can definitely escape.

750
00:56:25,831 --> 00:56:27,401
We don’t want you to die.

751
00:56:28,489 --> 00:56:30,904
Don’t get me wrong.
Let us discuss this in the next meeting.

752
00:56:31,549 --> 00:56:33,199
I trust the two of you.

753
00:56:45,881 --> 00:56:47,210
He is going to hang Balu.

754
00:56:47,573 --> 00:56:49,505
He is hesitating because
 he thinks it’s a sin.

755
00:56:49,787 --> 00:56:50,633
He is a retired judge.

756
00:56:50,673 --> 00:56:51,640
Hello.

757
00:56:51,679 --> 00:56:53,008
Why are you worried about sinning?

758
00:56:53,049 --> 00:56:54,135
That’s not the point.

759
00:56:54,619 --> 00:56:58,645
Based on the evidence
produced by the lawyer...

760
00:56:58,806 --> 00:57:02,510
...you award a ‘death by hanging’
sentence to an accused.

761
00:57:02,873 --> 00:57:04,886
Police officers like him
execute the sentence.

762
00:57:04,966 --> 00:57:08,388
Society ignores the role of decision makers
like you but call us murderers.

763
00:57:08,871 --> 00:57:12,777
We look through their harrowed eyes
and then hang them to death.

764
00:57:13,179 --> 00:57:16,159
Now tell me, whose
burden is that to carry?

765
00:57:16,883 --> 00:57:19,944
While serving as a judge, I’ve awarded
26 death by hanging sentences.

766
00:57:20,226 --> 00:57:22,721
On further appeal, 13 got life imprisonment
from the High Court...

767
00:57:23,004 --> 00:57:24,775
...and eight of them from
the Supreme Court.

768
00:57:25,660 --> 00:57:28,036
The President accepted
four of their mercy pleas.

769
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:29,969
It was just one person who
 was hung to death.

770
00:57:30,291 --> 00:57:33,190
Can you tell me who is
responsible for his death?

771
00:57:33,431 --> 00:57:34,357
Is it the President or is it me?

772
00:57:35,243 --> 00:57:37,940
It is God Almighty.

773
00:57:38,625 --> 00:57:39,390
I have a doubt.

774
00:57:40,155 --> 00:57:42,088
Can I refuse to hang Balu?

775
00:57:43,738 --> 00:57:45,470
Is Macaulay compelling you?

776
00:57:45,872 --> 00:57:48,409
Are you compelling him,
 Mr. Macaulay?

777
00:57:49,576 --> 00:57:52,959
As per law, no one can
 compel you.

778
00:57:53,643 --> 00:57:55,897
But you can very well consider
 it on ethical grounds.

779
00:58:01,454 --> 00:58:03,668
I think you are confused because
you think Balu is innocent.

780
00:58:03,909 --> 00:58:04,996
He is a criminal.

781
00:58:05,117 --> 00:58:06,808
Who said Balu is a criminal?

782
00:58:06,808 --> 00:58:08,499
Balu himself will admit to
 having hijacked a train.

783
00:58:08,701 --> 00:58:09,224
Did he hijack a train?

784
00:58:09,345 --> 00:58:11,921
Yes, why don’t you come to the prison
 and hear it straight from him.

785
00:58:14,579 --> 00:58:15,465
Give me 5 minutes.

786
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:25,450
We have to pay Rs 5000
to the van driver.

787
00:58:28,590 --> 00:58:29,757
Take this.

788
00:58:34,509 --> 00:58:36,803
I carried out a death
sentence on this day.

789
00:58:36,803 --> 00:58:39,985
I conduct the last rites for the unclaimed
bodies at the government hospitals.

790
00:58:40,145 --> 00:58:41,956
But nothing alleviates the
 sorrow in my heart.

791
00:58:42,239 --> 00:58:45,339
Saving people dying from hunger
will put you out of your misery.

792
00:58:45,862 --> 00:58:47,956
I want you to visit Balu
in prison.

793
00:58:48,278 --> 00:58:49,325
I forgot to tell you this.

794
00:58:49,365 --> 00:58:50,815
I heard Balu is a dacoit.

795
00:58:50,976 --> 00:58:52,506
I believe he hijacked a
train and robbed it.

796
00:58:52,627 --> 00:58:55,887
Please stop being friends
 with Balu’s men.

797
00:58:55,928 --> 00:58:58,223
I was his accomplice in the
 train hijack.

798
00:58:59,551 --> 00:59:01,444
Shall I disclose things that
 Macaulay didn’t?

799
00:59:02,008 --> 00:59:07,120
People of my village were dying
of hunger and disease.

800
00:59:07,886 --> 00:59:10,583
Dying was the only option.

801
00:59:10,664 --> 00:59:14,811
It was then that the Communist party sent
Comrade Balu to our village.

802
01:00:11,016 --> 01:00:12,224
Hurry up!

803
01:00:49,681 --> 01:00:55,599
‘Red salute!’

804
01:00:57,130 --> 01:01:01,237
‘Red salute!’

805
01:01:03,572 --> 01:01:06,752
"Come! Let’s dance,
sing and celebrate."

806
01:01:06,752 --> 01:01:10,014
"Grab all the happiness."

807
01:01:10,014 --> 01:01:12,671
"Push away poverty."

808
01:01:12,871 --> 01:01:14,683
"Shoo away darkness."

809
01:01:14,683 --> 01:01:19,475
"Brighten up your life."

810
01:01:19,475 --> 01:01:22,937
"Take each and every minute of your
life and brighten it up."

811
01:01:25,998 --> 01:01:28,010
Give it to the old and
children first.

812
01:01:28,776 --> 01:01:29,902
Save the rest.

813
01:01:30,306 --> 01:01:31,473
‘Red salute!’

814
01:01:31,513 --> 01:01:36,908
The Supreme Court passed a ruling to distribute all
 the unused grain in the granaries.

815
01:01:36,989 --> 01:01:40,451
I carried out the Supreme Court’s orders but the
 Special Court punishes me for that.

816
01:01:40,451 --> 01:01:42,625
Balu attempted to attack the army,
which protects our country.

817
01:01:42,988 --> 01:01:46,128
A person who doesn’t follow the law of the
land has to be hanged to death.

818
01:01:46,208 --> 01:01:48,664
I was supposed to attack
the army.

819
01:01:48,786 --> 01:01:51,322
Balu trained me for that.

820
01:01:56,475 --> 01:01:57,321
Turn left.

821
01:02:06,420 --> 01:02:07,346
Do you see the palace?

822
01:02:08,273 --> 01:02:08,916
I can see it.

823
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:10,206
Drive through the wall.

824
01:02:33,718 --> 01:02:37,865
People suffered in the deserts while
the kings lived in such palaces.

825
01:02:38,107 --> 01:02:40,241
They now make a living by letting
it out for film shooting.

826
01:02:41,207 --> 01:02:42,857
All the forts have been
made into hotels now.

827
01:02:46,079 --> 01:02:47,568
Did you see any fear
on my face?

828
01:02:47,568 --> 01:02:48,534
Not a bit.

829
01:02:48,654 --> 01:02:50,104
I’ve trained four people
 for the same thing.

830
01:02:50,144 --> 01:02:51,191
They were perfect.

831
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:53,768
But you are better than
 them.

832
01:02:54,856 --> 01:02:55,500
How?

833
01:02:56,346 --> 01:02:58,399
While driving through the wall,
the others took their feet off the accelerator.

834
01:02:59,124 --> 01:03:00,533
But you went ahead with
more gusto.

835
01:03:00,975 --> 01:03:03,270
You are the perfect candidate
for this mission.

836
01:03:04,277 --> 01:03:06,290
He has attacked army men who endure
 the toughest of situations...

837
01:03:06,290 --> 01:03:07,820
...just to protect people like
 you and me.

838
01:03:08,263 --> 01:03:12,611
Bhagat Singh planted a bomb in Parliament in
order to draw youngsters’ attention to politics.

839
01:03:12,852 --> 01:03:17,322
We wanted to gain public attention to prevent India
 from becoming a military dumping ground.

840
01:03:17,362 --> 01:03:19,455
We turned suicide bombers and
targeted the army.

841
01:03:35,198 --> 01:03:36,568
Is everything ready?

842
01:03:54,644 --> 01:04:01,247
Once you are sure about the distance and
the time of the explosion, press this button.

843
01:04:01,328 --> 01:04:02,093
This light will blink.

844
01:04:02,295 --> 01:04:06,320
At the same time, the light
on my remote will blink.

845
01:04:06,481 --> 01:04:08,615
The bomb will explode as soon
as I switch on the remote.

846
01:04:09,059 --> 01:04:14,977
If the remote fails to work,
 pull the trigger on this belt.

847
01:04:15,258 --> 01:04:16,144
The bomb will explode.

848
01:04:17,111 --> 01:04:20,815
The mission is in your
hands now.

849
01:04:21,297 --> 01:04:22,466
Give me the soldering stick.

850
01:04:23,230 --> 01:04:24,761
Careful.

851
01:04:25,003 --> 01:04:27,419
Apply the ointment immediately.
 Healing is slow in winter.

852
01:04:27,981 --> 01:04:29,270
You will end up with
 a scar for life.

853
01:04:29,672 --> 01:04:31,001
My life ends tomorrow.

854
01:04:36,678 --> 01:04:38,530
You know I am going to
 die tomorrow.

855
01:04:38,651 --> 01:04:41,107
Won’t you ask about my
 last wish?

856
01:05:20,965 --> 01:05:24,871
"The sharp wind which attacks
 the body…"

857
01:05:24,871 --> 01:05:27,529
"Will it touch me tomorrow?"

858
01:05:27,649 --> 01:05:31,435
"Will my body become a weapon?"

859
01:05:31,555 --> 01:05:34,937
"Will the world change slowly?"

860
01:05:35,018 --> 01:05:38,320
"There is no battle without bloodshed…"

861
01:05:38,601 --> 01:05:40,010
"Your sacrifice is the greatest…"

862
01:05:40,010 --> 01:05:41,460
"That won’t fade away…"

863
01:05:42,064 --> 01:05:46,733
"This will be a life that lives
beyond time…"

864
01:05:46,975 --> 01:05:49,391
"My dear… come."

865
01:07:26,423 --> 01:07:27,670
There is another 20 kms to go.

866
01:07:27,670 --> 01:07:29,885
This is the fastest and
safest way to travel.

867
01:08:43,202 --> 01:08:45,255
What are you going to do
after this attack?

868
01:08:45,497 --> 01:08:47,108
I have to inform the Party.

869
01:08:47,751 --> 01:08:51,979
Only then will our country become aware
of this operation and its objective.

870
01:09:03,260 --> 01:09:04,589
This is our last tea together.

871
01:09:16,344 --> 01:09:18,881
There is a small change in
 the plan, Comrade.

872
01:09:19,163 --> 01:09:20,250
I am going to wear the bomb.

873
01:09:20,291 --> 01:09:21,458
I am the human bomb.

874
01:09:21,538 --> 01:09:22,907
You will handle the remote.

875
01:09:23,108 --> 01:09:24,719
I am the one who will be
 blown into smithereens.

876
01:09:25,041 --> 01:09:26,089
Whose decision is this?

877
01:09:27,215 --> 01:09:28,101
Mine.

878
01:09:28,906 --> 01:09:31,080
I cannot obey independent
 decisions taken by you.

879
01:09:31,442 --> 01:09:32,650
I have to receive directions
 from the headquarters.

880
01:09:32,732 --> 01:09:34,020
I head this mission.

881
01:09:34,140 --> 01:09:35,066
You have to follow my orders.

882
01:09:36,596 --> 01:09:37,926
I want to die for a cause.

883
01:09:38,046 --> 01:09:39,052
Don’t demean me.

884
01:09:42,636 --> 01:09:44,608
The government knows
everything about me.

885
01:09:44,891 --> 01:09:46,018
They are on the lookout
for me.

886
01:09:46,340 --> 01:09:49,239
Wherever I go, death will
follow me.

887
01:09:49,763 --> 01:09:51,896
I will vanish after this assignment.

888
01:09:51,976 --> 01:09:54,674
You are well trained and the
government doesn’t know you.

889
01:09:55,036 --> 01:09:56,928
You can train and create many
 more revolutionaries.

890
01:09:57,734 --> 01:09:58,660
This is also a part of your training.

891
01:09:59,465 --> 01:10:03,290
You need a lot of grit to
 blast a human bomb.

892
01:10:04,861 --> 01:10:07,517
Do this and you will be able
 to continue my mission.

893
01:10:08,967 --> 01:10:10,818
‘Red salute!’

894
01:10:13,034 --> 01:10:16,094
Press the button as soon
as the light blinks.

895
01:10:56,717 --> 01:10:58,287
Fool, who are you?

896
01:10:58,368 --> 01:11:00,664
What are you doing here?
 Go away.

897
01:11:15,318 --> 01:11:17,170
Stop making India a
dumping ground.

898
01:11:18,338 --> 01:11:21,720
Run away from here or I will
shoot you down like a dog.

899
01:11:23,531 --> 01:11:24,338
Shoot me.

900
01:11:26,189 --> 01:11:28,686
Along with me, the ammunition
in the vehicles will blow up too.

901
01:11:29,773 --> 01:11:31,585
Let this blast be heard
across the country.

902
01:11:32,293 --> 01:11:33,420
There is so much waste around.

903
01:11:38,251 --> 01:11:40,586
You are killing people by dumping
 all the waste here.

904
01:11:41,714 --> 01:11:44,894
Let the resonance of this blast
save the people of our country.

905
01:11:45,015 --> 01:11:46,947
The Indian army is here to save
 the people of the country.

906
01:11:46,947 --> 01:11:48,719
You can scream as much
as you want.

907
01:11:48,759 --> 01:11:51,095
Stop it. We’ve spoken
enough, screamed enough.

908
01:11:51,457 --> 01:11:54,678
You can save only the borders,
not the people of this country.

909
01:11:54,742 --> 01:11:56,916
This explosion will be
heard all over the world.

910
01:11:57,197 --> 01:11:58,728
Let it explode now!

911
01:12:47,727 --> 01:12:50,947
I was ready to give up my life but
 was unable to take someone else’s.

912
01:12:51,229 --> 01:12:53,323
You tried giving up your life because
you didn’t want to take someone’s life.

913
01:12:53,403 --> 01:12:57,068
If we join hands,
 we can save Balu.

914
01:12:59,796 --> 01:13:01,687
He is one of us now.

915
01:13:02,170 --> 01:13:03,861
He will do anything for us.

916
01:13:04,666 --> 01:13:07,363
I don’t want to hang Balu,
 that’s all I want.

917
01:13:08,410 --> 01:13:11,914
You have to convince
Macaulay and meet Balu.

918
01:13:11,995 --> 01:13:13,282
Wear this jerkin.

919
01:13:15,778 --> 01:13:20,409
The tear on this blue jerkin will tell
 Balu you are one of us.

920
01:13:20,489 --> 01:13:22,462
Observe Balu’s every move.

921
01:13:22,583 --> 01:13:24,677
Tell them you need help to
 work on the gallows...

922
01:13:24,757 --> 01:13:26,770
...and procure entry passes
 for the four of us.

923
01:13:26,851 --> 01:13:28,019
My job ends there, doesn’t it?

924
01:13:28,139 --> 01:13:30,475
You do this first.

925
01:13:32,367 --> 01:13:36,876
I will go to the prison right away
and will help Balu escape.

926
01:13:44,816 --> 01:13:46,436
Prisoner Kandasamy has been

927
01:13:47,334 --> 01:13:48,654
transferred to Vellore

928
01:13:57,579 --> 01:13:59,858
prison. Look at him jumping the queue.

929
01:14:00,757 --> 01:14:01,776
Fill in a request

930
01:14:02,676 --> 01:14:04,655
form if you want to meet someone.

931
01:14:05,554 --> 01:14:06,753
I don't need to fill

932
01:14:08,152 --> 01:14:10,490
forms to see an officer. Which officer?

933
01:14:11,389 --> 01:14:12,289
I am here

934
01:14:13,188 --> 01:14:14,447
to meet Macaulay. The

935
01:14:17,394 --> 01:14:18,713
desperate to meet your

936
01:14:17,606 --> 01:14:19,524
boss. Macaulay wanted to see me.

937
01:14:18,450 --> 01:14:20,128
with Chellappa. Wait, do you

938
01:14:19,021 --> 01:14:20,400
know Chellappa? You can

939
01:14:21,299 --> 01:14:23,158
ask Chellappa. All right, come.

940
01:14:23,255 --> 01:14:24,394
Don’t get touchy. I

941
01:14:27,597 --> 01:14:29,695
am Karthikeyan calling from Gate 1.

942
01:14:30,594 --> 01:14:31,613
Someone’s here to

943
01:14:32,512 --> 01:14:34,492
meet Macaulay. He’s dark-skinned.

944
01:14:35,391 --> 01:14:36,350
He says he knows

945
01:14:37,250 --> 01:14:39,408
you. Tell him your name. Yamalingam.

946
01:14:39,808 --> 01:14:40,707
Thank God, you

947
01:14:41,606 --> 01:14:43,225
are here. I would have lost

948
01:14:43,343 --> 01:14:44,382
look like movie stars! What is it?

949
01:14:46,281 --> 01:14:47,181
I’ve brought

950
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:49,936
Yamalingam. Take him to the control room.

951
01:14:50,234 --> 01:14:51,133
I am on my way

952
01:14:51,229 --> 01:14:52,789
there. Ok, sir. Brother, I

953
01:14:53,687 --> 01:14:55,307
am overwhelmed by this kind

954
01:14:56,206 --> 01:14:57,584
of respect. What do you

955
01:14:58,484 --> 01:14:59,983
have in your pocket? This

956
01:15:00,081 --> 01:15:02,059
is a mere formality. My wallet...

957
01:15:02,155 --> 01:15:03,175
Macaulay gave him

958
01:15:04,074 --> 01:15:05,992
that phone. Hand it over to him.

959
01:15:06,089 --> 01:15:07,349
I see many changes in

960
01:15:08,248 --> 01:15:10,586
the prison. This wall wasn’t this high.

961
01:15:11,485 --> 01:15:12,385
We raised its

962
01:15:13,284 --> 01:15:14,604
height after we shot a

963
01:15:15,503 --> 01:15:17,241
prisoner who tried to escape.

964
01:15:17,339 --> 01:15:18,897
Wasn’t this the warehouse?

965
01:15:18,592 --> 01:15:20,031
We converted that into a

966
01:15:20,128 --> 01:15:21,627
control room. Walk up the

967
01:15:22,027 --> 01:15:23,465
stairs and you will meet

968
01:15:24,365 --> 01:15:25,864
Pasupathi. Chat with him.

969
01:15:26,934 --> 01:15:28,733
Yamalingam, come in, sit down.

970
01:15:29,633 --> 01:15:30,772
How do you know me?

971
01:15:31,672 --> 01:15:33,710
I saw you when you entered Gate 1.

972
01:15:34,609 --> 01:15:35,509
This is a live

973
01:15:36,408 --> 01:15:38,147
telecast from all the cameras

974
01:15:39,046 --> 01:15:40,486
installed in the prison.

975
01:15:40,582 --> 01:15:42,140
I get the first glimpse of

976
01:15:42,734 --> 01:15:44,414
pornographic books here! You

977
01:15:45,313 --> 01:15:47,712
don’t have to be embarrassed about this.

978
01:15:47,808 --> 01:15:48,708
Give me your

979
01:15:49,607 --> 01:15:51,165
mobile number. I will send

980
01:16:00,534 --> 01:16:01,972
come here because you’re

981
01:16:02,872 --> 01:16:04,491
not in a dilemma anymore? I

982
01:16:04,587 --> 01:16:06,027
didn’t come here because

983
01:16:06,123 --> 01:16:07,442
someone asked me to. I

984
01:16:07,540 --> 01:16:09,098
just obeyed ‘NTR’. (Famous

985
01:16:08,794 --> 01:16:10,472
yesteryear actor ) ‘NTR’? In

986
01:16:11,372 --> 01:16:13,051
my confused state, I watched

987
01:16:13,148 --> 01:16:14,587
‘Karnan’... ...there NTR

988
01:16:14,683 --> 01:16:16,183
tells ‘Muthuraman’ (Tamil

989
01:16:17,082 --> 01:16:18,701
actor) that Lord Krishna is

990
01:16:18,798 --> 01:16:20,356
the doer of good and evil.

991
01:16:22,767 --> 01:16:24,986
Follow me. You promised me something.

992
01:16:25,885 --> 01:16:26,784
A promise? What

993
01:16:27,684 --> 01:16:29,183
did I promise? That I can

994
01:16:30,083 --> 01:16:31,641
speak to Balu directly and

995
01:16:31,738 --> 01:16:33,837
hear about the crimes he committed.

996
01:16:34,735 --> 01:16:35,815
Ok, let’s go. Sir,

997
01:16:35,911 --> 01:16:37,231
why do have to trouble

998
01:16:38,131 --> 01:16:39,689
yourself over something so

999
01:16:40,089 --> 01:16:41,647
trivial? This is the first

1000
01:16:42,546 --> 01:16:44,046
time I’m going to witness

1001
01:16:44,945 --> 01:16:46,445
an interaction between...

1002
01:16:47,344 --> 01:16:48,663
...the hangman and the

1003
01:16:49,562 --> 01:16:51,721
person sentenced to death. Let’s go.

1004
01:16:54,620 --> 01:16:55,640
Hello! That looks

1005
01:16:56,539 --> 01:16:58,038
like Yamalingam. Have you

1006
01:16:58,937 --> 01:17:00,436
taken a work contract for

1007
01:17:01,336 --> 01:17:03,195
mending slippers in the prison?

1008
01:17:04,094 --> 01:17:05,114
I haven’t seen my

1009
01:17:06,013 --> 01:17:07,812
family in the last four years.

1010
01:17:08,711 --> 01:17:10,090
Will you please tell my

1011
01:17:10,989 --> 01:17:12,968
wife to submit a petition for me?

1012
01:17:13,867 --> 01:17:15,306
Ok. Please don’t forget.

1013
01:17:16,205 --> 01:17:17,644
You seem to know most of

1014
01:17:18,544 --> 01:17:19,983
the thugs here. They are

1015
01:17:20,882 --> 01:17:22,441
from my neighbourhood. How

1016
01:17:22,766 --> 01:17:24,684
your name? Mani. Lingam is here.

1017
01:17:24,781 --> 01:17:25,860
I wonder who he is

1018
01:17:26,759 --> 01:17:28,618
going to hang. Do you know him?

1019
01:17:28,715 --> 01:17:30,094
I even knew his father.

1020
01:17:30,190 --> 01:17:31,105
He is another murderer like him.

1021
01:17:33,902 --> 01:17:34,982
Somebody important

1022
01:17:35,882 --> 01:17:37,440
is here to meet you. Who’s

1023
01:17:38,339 --> 01:17:39,898
going to visit me and that

1024
01:17:40,797 --> 01:17:42,417
too with you! This is Balu,

1025
01:17:43,316 --> 01:17:44,695
the person sentenced to

1026
01:17:45,594 --> 01:17:47,093
death by hanging. This is

1027
01:17:47,993 --> 01:17:49,372
Yamalingam, the hangman

1028
01:17:49,869 --> 01:17:51,668
appointed to hang you. Did you

1029
01:17:51,764 --> 01:17:53,503
read the judgment thoroughly?

1030
01:17:54,403 --> 01:17:56,022
I have to be hanged without

1031
01:17:56,921 --> 01:17:58,241
pain by an experienced

1032
01:17:59,140 --> 01:18:01,179
hangman. He looks like a comedian.

1033
01:18:01,276 --> 01:18:02,235
He might tremble

1034
01:18:03,135 --> 01:18:04,454
at the mere sight of a

1035
01:18:06,383 --> 01:18:07,821
alive. If you unlock the

1036
01:18:08,721 --> 01:18:10,401
gate, I can go in and have a

1037
01:18:10,497 --> 01:18:12,776
relaxed conversation. Unlock the gate.

1038
01:18:18,175 --> 01:18:19,074
Please come

1039
01:18:19,974 --> 01:18:21,592
in. Sit down. You wanted to

1040
01:18:29,110 --> 01:18:30,549
speak to him… Strangling

1041
01:18:31,448 --> 01:18:33,068
two people to death and the

1042
01:18:33,966 --> 01:18:35,346
bank robbery... That is

1043
01:18:36,245 --> 01:18:37,744
true. I did it. The train

1044
01:18:37,841 --> 01:18:39,460
hijack in the desert... Did

1045
01:18:39,557 --> 01:18:41,295
he tell you? I did everything

1046
01:18:41,392 --> 01:18:42,771
including attacking the

1047
01:18:42,867 --> 01:18:44,486
army. He is willing to hang

1048
01:18:45,385 --> 01:18:46,765
you to death only after

1049
01:18:47,664 --> 01:18:49,283
hearing you confess. That’s

1050
01:18:49,379 --> 01:18:50,938
a bit too much. The person

1051
01:18:51,837 --> 01:18:53,516
sentenced to death convinces

1052
01:18:54,416 --> 01:18:55,556
the hangman to hang

1053
01:18:55,955 --> 01:18:57,634
him. I’ve been through hell,

1054
01:18:58,033 --> 01:18:59,412
hanging an innocent man

1055
01:19:00,312 --> 01:19:02,171
to death. You are great though.

1056
01:19:02,267 --> 01:19:03,226
You are writing,

1057
01:19:04,215 --> 01:19:05,835
will escape from here. Am I

1058
01:19:08,734 --> 01:19:10,233
not right, sir? Good tea.

1059
01:19:11,132 --> 01:19:12,691
How are you managing here?

1060
01:19:13,591 --> 01:19:15,149
Isn’t it very sultry? What

1061
01:19:16,049 --> 01:19:17,967
are you wearing? It is in vogue.

1062
01:19:18,866 --> 01:19:20,185
This isn’t his jerkin.

1063
01:19:21,084 --> 01:19:22,524
This style is for women.

1064
01:19:23,423 --> 01:19:24,682
Further, it’s old and

1065
01:19:25,581 --> 01:19:26,961
torn here. He must have

1066
01:19:27,860 --> 01:19:29,419
stolen it or he must be in

1067
01:19:30,318 --> 01:19:31,937
love. Show him the gallows.

1068
01:19:41,961 --> 01:19:43,519
I don’t think you remember

1069
01:19:44,419 --> 01:19:45,978
me. I took your father and

1070
01:19:46,878 --> 01:19:48,256
you home after the last

1071
01:19:49,155 --> 01:19:51,254
hanging. Your father was my friend.

1072
01:19:58,574 --> 01:19:59,833
You look so different

1073
01:20:00,732 --> 01:20:02,471
now. You had a great physique

1074
01:20:03,371 --> 01:20:04,570
those days. Macaulay

1075
01:20:05,469 --> 01:20:06,728
gave me this job just

1076
01:20:07,627 --> 01:20:09,246
because I know you well. He

1077
01:20:10,145 --> 01:20:11,705
usually keeps unfit people

1078
01:20:12,604 --> 01:20:13,982
at a distance. The Home

1079
01:21:08,660 --> 01:21:10,278
Secretary has finalised the

1080
01:21:11,178 --> 01:21:12,617
date for sending back...

1081
01:21:13,516 --> 01:21:15,735
...the seven South African prisoners.

1082
01:21:15,430 --> 01:21:16,390
I told you those

1083
01:21:16,085 --> 01:21:17,380
matters could wait until Balu’s hanging.

1084
01:21:19,383 --> 01:21:20,283
No sir, this

1085
01:21:21,182 --> 01:21:23,341
was a collective decision made by...

1086
01:21:24,240 --> 01:21:25,139
...the State,

1087
01:21:26,039 --> 01:21:28,316
Central and South African governments.

1088
01:21:32,310 --> 01:21:33,688
Why are you eating food

1089
01:21:34,034 --> 01:21:34,933
Take this,

1090
01:21:33,827 --> 01:21:35,445
sir. Sign here, Yamalingam.

1091
01:21:36,344 --> 01:21:37,664
Can I have four people

1092
01:21:38,563 --> 01:21:40,243
to assist me? Take 40. Shall

1093
01:21:45,556 --> 01:21:46,876
I bring them tomorrow?

1094
01:21:47,775 --> 01:21:49,634
From where will you bring them?

1095
01:21:50,534 --> 01:21:51,673
My neighbourhood… I

1096
01:21:52,573 --> 01:21:55,091
told you to take four men from the prison.

1097
01:21:55,990 --> 01:21:56,890
They should

1098
01:21:57,789 --> 01:21:59,767
know the job. What kind of a job?

1099
01:22:00,667 --> 01:22:01,866
Tinkering, painting,

1100
01:22:02,765 --> 01:22:04,264
carpentry, plumbing… What

1101
01:22:04,361 --> 01:22:05,621
did you think of this

1102
01:22:05,717 --> 01:22:07,156
prison? It doesn’t house

1103
01:22:08,056 --> 01:22:09,674
just ex-politicians. It has

1104
01:22:10,574 --> 01:22:12,073
scientists who can launch

1105
01:22:12,972 --> 01:22:14,412
rockets, heart surgeons,

1106
01:22:15,311 --> 01:22:16,907
engineers… How many of them do you need?

1107
01:22:17,405 --> 01:22:18,305
This prison

1108
01:22:19,203 --> 01:22:20,763
is like a science academy.

1109
01:22:20,859 --> 01:22:22,477
Provide him with everything

1110
01:22:23,377 --> 01:22:25,416
he needs. Be with him. Come along.

1111
01:22:26,315 --> 01:22:27,395
This looks like an

1112
01:22:28,295 --> 01:22:29,973
old map. I am unable to find

1113
01:22:30,873 --> 01:22:32,312
the control room. You’re

1114
01:22:33,211 --> 01:22:34,890
having fun while I am stuck.

1115
01:22:35,789 --> 01:22:37,168
Macaulay is not as dumb

1116
01:22:38,068 --> 01:22:39,567
as you all think. I can’t

1117
01:22:40,467 --> 01:22:41,786
take any of you inside

1118
01:22:42,685 --> 01:22:44,484
the prison. Sit down. Macaulay

1119
01:22:45,383 --> 01:22:46,823
has asked me to take the

1120
01:22:46,919 --> 01:22:48,418
help of inmates. Your aim

1121
01:22:49,318 --> 01:22:50,757
in life is to never hang

1122
01:22:51,656 --> 01:22:53,095
anyone. But our ambition

1123
01:22:53,994 --> 01:22:55,493
is to get Balu out alive.

1124
01:22:55,983 --> 01:22:57,302
Did Balu recognise the

1125
01:22:58,202 --> 01:23:00,480
jerkin? He did...he knew it was yours.

1126
01:23:00,577 --> 01:23:01,476
We were waiting

1127
01:23:01,594 --> 01:23:03,033
say? The control room is

1128
01:23:03,932 --> 01:23:05,612
above the old warehouse. Did

1129
01:23:06,510 --> 01:23:08,249
you meet the person in-charge

1130
01:23:08,346 --> 01:23:09,545
of the control room?

1131
01:23:10,043 --> 01:23:11,601
That’s Pasupathi. He has a

1132
01:23:12,501 --> 01:23:14,059
weakness for women. We are

1133
01:23:14,959 --> 01:23:16,578
friends now. He gave me his

1134
01:23:17,478 --> 01:23:18,797
phone number and email

1135
01:23:19,696 --> 01:23:21,435
ID. Do you have his email ID?

1136
01:23:23,834 --> 01:23:25,033
That’s great. Remove

1137
01:23:25,933 --> 01:23:27,670
the SIM card from this phone.

1138
01:23:28,570 --> 01:23:29,890
Macaulay gave him this

1139
01:23:30,789 --> 01:23:32,408
phone. Do a thorough check.

1140
01:23:33,307 --> 01:23:34,686
This is a dual SIM card

1141
01:23:35,586 --> 01:23:37,204
phone. One SIM card is from

1142
01:23:38,104 --> 01:23:39,662
a general service provider

1143
01:23:40,562 --> 01:23:42,061
while the other isn’t. My

1144
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:44,579
guess is that it belongs to

1145
01:23:45,478 --> 01:23:47,158
a special frequency network.

1146
01:23:58,892 --> 01:24:00,152
I am going to phish a

1147
01:24:01,052 --> 01:24:02,730
virus into his inbox. We can

1148
01:24:03,630 --> 01:24:05,009
then have total control

1149
01:24:05,908 --> 01:24:08,307
over their network. We’re now connected.

1150
01:24:09,206 --> 01:24:10,106
He seems to

1151
01:24:11,004 --> 01:24:12,564
be online always. A person

1152
01:24:13,463 --> 01:24:14,962
like him in-charge of the

1153
01:24:27,099 --> 01:24:28,958
control room works well for us.

1154
01:24:34,962 --> 01:24:36,102
Vishwa, explain it.

1155
01:24:40,211 --> 01:24:41,711
The computer we’ve hacked

1156
01:24:42,209 --> 01:24:43,648
now does not control the

1157
01:24:43,873 --> 01:24:45,013
The camera controls

1158
01:24:45,111 --> 01:24:46,789
are on another LAN. You have

1159
01:24:46,886 --> 01:24:48,265
to help us connect that

1160
01:24:49,164 --> 01:24:51,442
LAN to the internet. What should I do?

1161
01:24:52,341 --> 01:24:53,241
We cannot count

1162
01:24:54,140 --> 01:24:56,479
on the wireless transmission in prison.

1163
01:24:57,378 --> 01:24:58,277
Plug this into

1164
01:24:59,177 --> 01:25:00,616
this socket. This is the

1165
01:25:01,516 --> 01:25:03,015
Ethernet switch. Plug the

1166
01:25:03,914 --> 01:25:05,533
other end of the cable into

1167
01:25:06,432 --> 01:25:08,051
the internet modem. Observe

1168
01:25:08,950 --> 01:25:10,570
this carefully. The control

1169
01:25:11,469 --> 01:25:12,548
room should have a

1170
01:25:13,447 --> 01:25:14,887
setup like this. A cable

1171
01:25:15,786 --> 01:25:17,404
connection is safer. Repeat

1172
01:25:18,304 --> 01:25:20,762
it. Plug this end of the cable into this.

1173
01:25:23,460 --> 01:25:25,079
other end here. This is the

1174
01:25:25,176 --> 01:25:26,615
Ethernet switch and this

1175
01:25:27,645 --> 01:25:28,664
If you succeed in

1176
01:25:30,153 --> 01:25:31,172
What is the first

1177
01:25:31,269 --> 01:25:32,887
thing I should do? When you

1178
01:25:32,985 --> 01:25:34,304
enter the prison, wear

1179
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:36,020
this cable wire around your

1180
01:25:36,116 --> 01:25:37,555
neck like a talisman. Be

1181
01:25:37,652 --> 01:25:40,051
confident and start work on the gallows.

1182
01:25:48,772 --> 01:25:49,671
We do not

1183
01:25:50,571 --> 01:25:53,090
normally allow them to handle these tools.

1184
01:25:53,989 --> 01:25:54,889
They’ve now

1185
01:25:55,288 --> 01:25:56,666
been allowed to because

1186
01:25:57,566 --> 01:25:59,005
they are working. You be

1187
01:25:59,904 --> 01:26:01,463
careful. Please don’t hold

1188
01:26:02,362 --> 01:26:03,921
a grudge if something goes

1189
01:26:04,820 --> 01:26:06,439
wrong. Take it. We murdered

1190
01:26:07,338 --> 01:26:08,658
people out of rage. We

1191
01:26:09,558 --> 01:26:11,236
repent it today. We’ve built

1192
01:26:12,136 --> 01:26:13,575
temple towers as well as

1193
01:26:14,474 --> 01:26:15,913
tombstones. But you have

1194
01:26:16,813 --> 01:26:18,551
demeaned us by making us work

1195
01:26:19,450 --> 01:26:21,070
on these gallows. Who needs

1196
01:26:21,969 --> 01:26:23,288
this damned money? Use

1197
01:26:24,187 --> 01:26:25,806
it to buy yourself a drink.

1198
01:26:26,705 --> 01:26:28,145
When I touch a sickle, I

1199
01:26:29,044 --> 01:26:31,263
get the urge to kill. Goddess Kali...

1200
01:26:40,662 --> 01:26:41,561
From now on, no

1201
01:26:42,461 --> 01:26:44,140
phone should work within the

1202
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:46,479
prison premises. That is

1203
01:26:47,378 --> 01:26:49,116
why I am getting this special

1204
01:26:50,016 --> 01:26:51,336
jammer fixed. We can’t

1205
01:26:51,735 --> 01:26:53,173
maintain confidentiality

1206
01:26:54,073 --> 01:26:55,452
communicating through a

1207
01:26:56,351 --> 01:26:57,851
walkie-talkie. I’ve taken

1208
01:26:58,750 --> 01:27:00,609
permission from the government.

1209
01:27:01,008 --> 01:27:02,687
Just eight persons will have

1210
01:27:02,995 --> 01:27:04,673
classified information. Balu

1211
01:27:05,573 --> 01:27:07,191
knows everything about you.

1212
01:27:07,289 --> 01:27:08,667
I am an Indo-African. I

1213
01:27:09,566 --> 01:27:11,545
was caught spying for my country.

1214
01:27:12,445 --> 01:27:13,464
I was involved in

1215
01:27:14,363 --> 01:27:16,461
many explosions across the country.

1216
01:27:17,361 --> 01:27:18,260
But they are

1217
01:27:19,159 --> 01:27:20,718
linking me to an unrelated

1218
01:27:21,617 --> 01:27:23,176
case and torturing me with

1219
01:27:24,974 --> 01:27:26,413
by my country when I was

1220
01:27:27,313 --> 01:27:28,931
charged with espionage. All

1221
01:27:29,831 --> 01:27:31,330
espionage agents who work

1222
01:27:36,539 --> 01:27:37,917
help when I need it. Do

1223
01:27:38,817 --> 01:27:40,616
not disturb the patient. Thank

1224
01:27:46,022 --> 01:27:47,521
God, you listened to that

1225
01:27:48,421 --> 01:27:50,158
police officer. I was worried

1226
01:27:51,058 --> 01:27:52,318
that you would revert

1227
01:27:53,217 --> 01:27:55,316
to your old ways. Open our website.

1228
01:27:56,214 --> 01:27:57,174
Fellow Comrades,

1229
01:27:58,074 --> 01:27:59,752
please share any information

1230
01:28:00,652 --> 01:28:01,792
that you know about

1231
01:28:02,691 --> 01:28:04,310
the Chennai Central Prison.

1232
01:28:11,012 --> 01:28:12,631
Translate this message into

1233
01:28:13,530 --> 01:28:15,210
all languages and upload it.

1234
01:28:15,622 --> 01:28:16,941
You’ve been given this

1235
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:20,298
phone because until the day of hanging...

1236
01:28:21,198 --> 01:28:22,097
...this team

1237
01:28:22,997 --> 01:28:24,436
will be held responsible

1238
01:28:25,335 --> 01:28:26,835
for anything that happens

1239
01:28:26,932 --> 01:28:28,131
Apart from the eight

1240
01:28:29,031 --> 01:28:30,409
of us, there is another

1241
01:28:31,308 --> 01:28:32,687
person on this network.

1242
01:28:33,587 --> 01:28:35,326
That’s the hangman. If anyone

1243
01:28:36,224 --> 01:28:37,783
presses ‘1’ on the keypad,

1244
01:28:38,683 --> 01:28:40,002
an emergency beep will

1245
01:29:14,597 --> 01:29:16,455
you always inside the bathroom?

1246
01:29:18,355 --> 01:29:19,554
Lingam, what are you

1247
01:29:20,453 --> 01:29:22,072
doing here? I am monitoring

1248
01:29:22,971 --> 01:29:24,350
how the men work when I

1249
01:29:25,250 --> 01:29:27,527
am not there. You are monitoring them?

1250
01:29:28,427 --> 01:29:29,326
Keep the door

1251
01:29:30,226 --> 01:29:31,844
locked. Lingam’s activities

1252
01:29:32,744 --> 01:29:34,302
must be monitored as well.

1253
01:29:35,202 --> 01:29:37,241
Play the footage from the gallows.

1254
01:29:38,140 --> 01:29:39,220
Delete the footage

1255
01:29:40,119 --> 01:29:41,557
of Lingam in the control

1256
01:29:42,457 --> 01:29:44,136
room immediately. The camera

1257
01:29:54,390 --> 01:29:55,290
It is 175 years

1258
01:29:56,189 --> 01:29:57,868
since this prison was built.

1259
01:29:58,767 --> 01:30:00,026
The young inmates are

1260
01:30:00,925 --> 01:30:02,485
going to capture important

1261
01:30:03,384 --> 01:30:05,003
moments of these years... .

1262
01:30:05,902 --> 01:30:07,761
..through a cultural programme.

1263
01:30:08,661 --> 01:30:09,679
Tamil Nadu Prison

1264
01:30:10,579 --> 01:30:12,137
Department, Central Prison

1265
01:30:13,037 --> 01:30:14,596
175th anniversary. "At the

1266
01:30:20,495 --> 01:30:21,934
Marina beach..." "As she

1267
01:30:22,833 --> 01:30:24,272
walked in the breeze..."

1268
01:30:25,172 --> 01:30:26,551
"She became one with my

1269
01:30:27,449 --> 01:30:29,368
breath..." "I’ve fallen in love,

1270
01:30:30,268 --> 01:30:31,587
brother!" "Oh, naughty

1271
01:30:32,486 --> 01:30:34,105
rascal, is that all?" "Jail

1272
01:30:35,004 --> 01:30:36,803
is a torture, don’t understand

1273
01:30:37,703 --> 01:30:38,901
the future." "If one

1274
01:30:39,801 --> 01:30:41,240
is born a bird, there is

1275
01:30:42,140 --> 01:30:43,639
no imprisonment." "But to

1276
01:30:44,538 --> 01:30:46,157
fly away, we don’t have two

1277
01:30:47,056 --> 01:30:48,495
wings." "The jail didn’t

1278
01:30:49,395 --> 01:30:50,953
come on its own. It’s what

1279
01:30:51,853 --> 01:30:53,232
we built…" "And what we

1280
01:30:54,131 --> 01:30:55,869
built, has now bound us." "At

1281
01:30:56,769 --> 01:30:58,208
the Marina beach..." "As

1282
01:30:59,107 --> 01:31:00,787
she walked in the breeze..."

1283
01:31:01,686 --> 01:31:02,884
"She became one with

1284
01:31:03,784 --> 01:31:05,343
my breath..." "I’ve fallen

1285
01:31:06,243 --> 01:31:07,742
in love, brother!" "For a

1286
01:31:08,640 --> 01:31:10,260
mere cigarette, a war could

1287
01:31:11,159 --> 01:31:12,598
erupt here." "The police

1288
01:31:13,498 --> 01:31:14,996
will charge with batons."

1289
01:31:15,896 --> 01:31:17,455
"Even ‘encounter’ killings

1290
01:31:18,354 --> 01:31:19,913
happen here." "Who will be

1291
01:31:20,812 --> 01:31:22,431
the witness?" "Politics and

1292
01:31:23,330 --> 01:31:24,649
crime come together in

1293
01:31:25,549 --> 01:31:27,107
jail." "And with that they

1294
01:31:28,007 --> 01:31:29,745
make the country wail." "They

1295
01:31:30,645 --> 01:31:32,024
even imprisoned the man

1296
01:31:32,923 --> 01:31:34,722
who said the world was round."

1297
01:31:35,622 --> 01:31:36,881
"And now apologies to

1298
01:31:37,780 --> 01:31:39,279
him abound." "This is the

1299
01:31:40,179 --> 01:31:41,557
place where great books

1300
01:31:42,456 --> 01:31:43,896
were born." "This is the

1301
01:31:44,795 --> 01:31:46,294
land where great thoughts

1302
01:31:47,194 --> 01:31:48,752
were sown." "At the Marina

1303
01:31:49,652 --> 01:31:51,270
beach..." "As she walked in

1304
01:31:52,170 --> 01:31:53,728
the breeze..." "She became

1305
01:31:54,628 --> 01:31:56,307
one with my breath..." "I’ve

1306
01:31:57,207 --> 01:31:58,706
fallen in love, brother!"

1307
01:31:59,605 --> 01:32:00,984
"Oh, naughty rascal, is

1308
01:32:01,883 --> 01:32:03,142
that all?" "Jail is a

1309
01:32:04,041 --> 01:32:05,780
torture, don’t understand the

1310
01:32:06,680 --> 01:32:08,298
future." "Out of suspicion,

1311
01:32:09,198 --> 01:32:10,697
this sinner strangled and

1312
01:32:11,596 --> 01:32:12,916
killed…" "His wife was

1313
01:32:13,816 --> 01:32:15,675
innocent." "He’s serving a life

1314
01:32:16,574 --> 01:32:18,132
sentence but is innocent."

1315
01:32:19,032 --> 01:32:20,590
"Now, he’s turned insane."

1316
01:32:21,490 --> 01:32:23,169
"It is the Indian Penal Code

1317
01:32:24,069 --> 01:32:25,627
that brought us together."

1318
01:32:26,527 --> 01:32:27,905
"Who wrote it?" "He was

1319
01:32:28,804 --> 01:32:30,003
a man from England."

1320
01:32:30,903 --> 01:32:32,461
"Our country supports that

1321
01:32:33,361 --> 01:32:34,620
man ‘Macaulay’." "Our

1322
01:32:35,519 --> 01:32:37,199
‘Macaulay’ is a hot-tempered

1323
01:32:38,098 --> 01:32:39,597
man." "Worrying about the

1324
01:32:40,497 --> 01:32:41,756
world outside, we are

1325
01:32:42,655 --> 01:32:44,454
distraught." "They should look

1326
01:32:45,353 --> 01:32:46,853
at our situation and give

1327
01:32:47,752 --> 01:32:49,251
it some thought." "At the

1328
01:32:50,151 --> 01:32:51,589
Marina beach..." "As she

1329
01:32:52,488 --> 01:32:54,227
walked in the breeze..." "She

1330
01:32:55,127 --> 01:32:56,865
became one with my breath..."

1331
01:32:57,765 --> 01:32:59,024
"I’ve fallen in love,

1332
01:32:59,923 --> 01:33:01,242
brother!" "Oh, naughty

1333
01:33:02,142 --> 01:33:03,761
rascal, is that all?" "Jail

1334
01:33:04,661 --> 01:33:06,458
is a torture, don’t understand

1335
01:33:07,358 --> 01:33:08,557
the future." "If one

1336
01:33:09,456 --> 01:33:10,895
is born a bird, there is

1337
01:33:11,795 --> 01:33:13,294
no imprisonment." "But to

1338
01:33:14,194 --> 01:33:15,812
fly away, we don’t have two

1339
01:33:16,712 --> 01:33:18,151
wings." "The jail didn’t

1340
01:33:19,050 --> 01:33:20,609
come on its own. It’s what

1341
01:33:21,508 --> 01:33:22,887
we built…" "And what we

1342
01:33:23,787 --> 01:33:25,405
built, has now bound us." I

1343
01:33:37,805 --> 01:33:39,304
have configured a QR code

1344
01:33:40,203 --> 01:33:41,762
application on your phone.

1345
01:33:42,661 --> 01:33:44,161
When you touch this icon,

1346
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:46,118
the application will open.

1347
01:33:46,518 --> 01:33:48,017
What you see on the shirt

1348
01:33:48,917 --> 01:33:50,596
pocket is not just a design.

1349
01:33:51,495 --> 01:33:52,994
When you focus your phone

1350
01:33:53,712 --> 01:33:54,671
Read it. All the

1351
01:33:55,571 --> 01:33:57,310
cameras in the prison are now

1352
01:33:58,209 --> 01:33:59,708
in our control. ‘Plan 1 –

1353
01:34:00,107 --> 01:34:01,427
On Anna’s birthday’ ‘2

1354
01:34:01,826 --> 01:34:03,625
- The day the minister visits’

1355
01:34:04,024 --> 01:34:05,643
‘3 - On the day, the prison

1356
01:34:06,042 --> 01:34:07,482
police undergo training’

1357
01:34:07,881 --> 01:34:09,200
When you get a chance,

1358
01:34:09,599 --> 01:34:11,099
wear this shirt to prison

1359
01:34:11,498 --> 01:34:12,937
and meet Balu. Make Balu

1360
01:34:13,337 --> 01:34:14,955
take a picture of you using

1361
01:34:15,355 --> 01:34:16,794
this phone. He will read

1362
01:34:19,092 --> 01:34:20,711
picture. If he reads it, he

1363
01:34:21,009 --> 01:34:22,508
very simple. I will prove

1364
01:34:22,908 --> 01:34:24,347
to you that I am a hero.

1365
01:34:37,974 --> 01:34:38,564
Keep quiet.

1366
01:34:39,076 --> 01:34:39,588
Hello, sir.

1367
01:34:42,957 --> 01:34:43,706
Step aside.

1368
01:34:44,073 --> 01:34:46,001
You stay fit until you get
the job.

1369
01:34:55,489 --> 01:34:57,615
Lingam, what are you
doing here?

1370
01:34:57,734 --> 01:34:59,309
One has to follow several steps
 before hanging a person.

1371
01:34:59,549 --> 01:35:00,690
I require five ropes...

1372
01:35:00,887 --> 01:35:03,367
I have to make a dummy that
matches Balu’s height and weight.

1373
01:35:03,682 --> 01:35:05,493
I have to practise hanging
 the dummy.

1374
01:35:05,651 --> 01:35:08,959
It is hard to explain all this.

1375
01:35:09,351 --> 01:35:11,163
I am here to take Balu’s
measurements.

1376
01:35:18,682 --> 01:35:20,808
If I get my hands on him,
 I’ll squash him.

1377
01:35:24,686 --> 01:35:25,631
Open the gate.

1378
01:35:33,544 --> 01:35:34,175
Hello, sir.

1379
01:35:34,175 --> 01:35:34,765
Are you all right?

1380
01:35:35,197 --> 01:35:36,891
What did you do, sir?

1381
01:35:37,323 --> 01:35:38,978
I am terrified to walk in here.

1382
01:35:39,332 --> 01:35:42,521
When the prison was under his control,
everyone welcomed me.

1383
01:35:42,836 --> 01:35:44,371
Not sure, whose control it
 is in now...

1384
01:35:44,411 --> 01:35:46,103
You seem to have drawn
 everyone to your side.

1385
01:35:46,143 --> 01:35:47,796
I don’t know when
someone will kill me.

1386
01:35:48,348 --> 01:35:50,198
Just do your job.

1387
01:35:52,206 --> 01:35:52,954
Please hold this.

1388
01:35:52,954 --> 01:35:54,174
Write down these measurements.

1389
01:35:54,923 --> 01:35:55,828
Perfect!

1390
01:35:56,379 --> 01:35:57,639
Look straight.

1391
01:36:02,087 --> 01:36:03,151
Please hand me the measuring tape.

1392
01:36:10,316 --> 01:36:11,143
That’s 5 ft 4”.

1393
01:36:13,781 --> 01:36:15,041
Why are the measurements
taken only up to the neck?

1394
01:36:15,080 --> 01:36:17,442
The head will be held intact by the noose,
we can skip that measurement.

1395
01:36:23,820 --> 01:36:25,277
Will you include the weight
of the head as well?

1396
01:36:27,123 --> 01:36:28,343
No, that weight will be
deducted automatically.

1397
01:36:28,697 --> 01:36:29,327
That’s 75 kilos.

1398
01:36:29,405 --> 01:36:30,430
Seventy-five multiplied by 3?

1399
01:36:30,469 --> 01:36:31,335
That’s 225.

1400
01:36:31,531 --> 01:36:32,437
Make a note of that, sir.

1401
01:36:34,366 --> 01:36:35,509
Why triple my weight?

1402
01:36:35,665 --> 01:36:38,461
We have to make a dummy that
will be three times your weight.

1403
01:36:38,540 --> 01:36:42,043
I have to hang the dummy a few times
to test the strength of the rope....

1404
01:36:42,083 --> 01:36:43,618
... and then you can die
easily.

1405
01:36:44,996 --> 01:36:46,374
Will the dummy look
exactly like me?

1406
01:36:46,414 --> 01:36:48,658
Yes, it will.
 You’ll be astonished.

1407
01:36:49,051 --> 01:36:50,193
Why don’t you see for yourself?

1408
01:36:50,745 --> 01:36:53,658
Can I watch the practice session?

1409
01:36:55,115 --> 01:36:55,942
What next?

1410
01:36:56,217 --> 01:36:56,807
I need a photograph.

1411
01:36:56,925 --> 01:36:57,398
For what?

1412
01:36:57,516 --> 01:36:58,382
To make the dummy.

1413
01:37:03,579 --> 01:37:04,446
Can I take a photo of the
two of you?

1414
01:37:07,399 --> 01:37:08,264
Just for a memory.

1415
01:37:11,099 --> 01:37:12,478
Can you smile please?

1416
01:37:13,815 --> 01:37:15,114
You both look great.

1417
01:37:16,886 --> 01:37:18,421
Will you click a photo of
us now?

1418
01:37:18,856 --> 01:37:19,957
You have to press this button.

1419
01:37:26,493 --> 01:37:27,870
Will you click a photo of us now?

1420
01:37:28,111 --> 01:37:29,765
You have to press this button.

1421
01:37:31,496 --> 01:37:33,190
Remove the towel.

1422
01:37:36,300 --> 01:37:37,127
I will pose without the towel.

1423
01:37:39,961 --> 01:37:40,631
Am I looking all right?

1424
01:37:48,230 --> 01:37:49,804
‘Plan 1 – On Anna’s birthday.’

1425
01:37:49,883 --> 01:37:51,497
‘2  – The day the minister visits.’

1426
01:37:51,497 --> 01:37:52,560
‘3 – On the day the prison
 police undergo training.’

1427
01:38:00,710 --> 01:38:01,261
Are you done?

1428
01:38:01,261 --> 01:38:01,851
Yes.

1429
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:10,708
Goodbye.

1430
01:38:28,583 --> 01:38:29,488
Put him on the speakerphone.

1431
01:38:33,583 --> 01:38:36,969
I made Balu read the plan even
while Macaulay was around.

1432
01:38:36,969 --> 01:38:37,560
Are you happy now?

1433
01:38:37,560 --> 01:38:38,582
I am very happy.

1434
01:38:39,449 --> 01:38:41,851
Balu might pass on information
 through you at anytime.

1435
01:38:41,851 --> 01:38:42,952
Be alert.

1436
01:38:44,331 --> 01:38:44,882
Kuyili...

1437
01:38:45,040 --> 01:38:45,787
Yes...

1438
01:38:53,662 --> 01:38:55,158
You might have misled
him with an ‘Ok’.

1439
01:38:56,063 --> 01:38:58,386
We have to be patient until
 we finish this operation.

1440
01:38:58,661 --> 01:38:59,450
That is why I said ‘Ok’.

1441
01:38:59,528 --> 01:39:01,024
He should not feel cheated.

1442
01:39:01,141 --> 01:39:02,441
Do you want me to fall in
 love with him?

1443
01:39:02,559 --> 01:39:05,158
This is not a problem that concerns
just Lingam and me.

1444
01:39:05,984 --> 01:39:07,795
This is about our movement.

1445
01:39:07,835 --> 01:39:12,362
When a girl works in the public domain,
problems like these are bound to come up.

1446
01:39:12,362 --> 01:39:15,040
No matter what, I have to continue
this e-waste assignment.

1447
01:39:15,197 --> 01:39:16,732
That’s the directive from
 the Party.

1448
01:39:17,126 --> 01:39:21,891
When the assignment is through, you have to take
 care of Lingam and help him understand.

1449
01:40:04,371 --> 01:40:10,040
The old man will bring the duplicate key from
Macaulay’s room to Balu’s cell.

1450
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:11,497
I will manage the police in
 charge of your block.

1451
01:40:11,693 --> 01:40:13,465
Nobody will suspect me.

1452
01:40:13,741 --> 01:40:15,710
My good conduct for the past 34 years
 will not give rise to any suspicion.

1453
01:40:15,710 --> 01:40:17,717
I will fetch the key and
unlock your cell.

1454
01:40:17,757 --> 01:40:20,907
Even if you help me escape
from the cell,

1455
01:40:20,985 --> 01:40:22,560
...it is impossible to get past the security
personnel in this prison.

1456
01:40:22,638 --> 01:40:23,977
This is a different route.

1457
01:40:24,017 --> 01:40:26,143
They brought you in
through the tunnel block.

1458
01:40:26,143 --> 01:40:28,701
You would have taken a
 left at the sixth junction.

1459
01:40:28,977 --> 01:40:30,277
But now you have to turn right.

1460
01:40:32,841 --> 01:40:36,307
When I am taken to South Africa,
they’ll give me a blue shirt and black trousers.

1461
01:40:36,464 --> 01:40:38,629
You can find it in a bag numbered
245 in the prison costume room.

1462
01:40:38,944 --> 01:40:42,409
If the dress can be replicated,
we can switch places.

1463
01:40:42,448 --> 01:40:43,747
Do not worry.

1464
01:40:48,079 --> 01:40:52,882
I can get the dress ready and hide it under the
stairway of block 'A’ the previous day

1465
01:40:52,120 --> 01:40:53,104
You can change there.

1466
01:40:53,612 --> 01:40:55,344
What are you all doing
 here still?

1467
01:40:55,384 --> 01:40:57,430
Leave now.

1468
01:40:57,340 --> 01:40:58,876
He is one of us.
He is just putting on an act.

1469
01:40:58,475 --> 01:40:59,696
Disperse now.

1470
01:40:58,365 --> 01:41:03,798
We toil for these people but they label
us as extremists and terrorists.

1471
01:41:04,113 --> 01:41:05,019
I agree.

1472
01:41:05,885 --> 01:41:11,633
Aggregation of Government, Private and Foreign
capital has resulted in capital accumulation.

1473
01:41:13,365 --> 01:41:15,689
We worked towards
uniting all the workers.

1474
01:41:15,767 --> 01:41:18,011
But all the capitalists have
 come together.

1475
01:41:18,090 --> 01:41:19,546
The Media has joined
them too.

1476
01:41:19,783 --> 01:41:22,499
The public perception will depend on
 how the Media projects us.

1477
01:41:22,539 --> 01:41:25,374
These circumstances are a big
hurdle  to mobilise people.

1478
01:41:26,121 --> 01:41:28,365
We are still a minority in
 this society.

1479
01:41:28,563 --> 01:41:31,279
Four years after the success of
 the Russian revolution,

1480
01:41:31,318 --> 01:41:32,499
Comrade Lenin said..

1481
01:41:32,499 --> 01:41:35,492
‘Communists are but a drop in the ocean,
a drop in the ocean of the people.’

1482
01:41:35,806 --> 01:41:37,657
We are just a drop...

1483
01:41:38,366 --> 01:41:39,744
Mao said the same.

1484
01:41:39,861 --> 01:41:44,193
Communist members have always been a minority
when it comes to numbers in this society.

1485
01:41:44,429 --> 01:41:46,673
It’s not a disadvantage
 being in the minority.

1486
01:41:46,752 --> 01:41:52,696
We have to work towards resolving people’s
problems, gain their trust and win their support.

1487
01:41:57,933 --> 01:41:58,682
Is everything ready?

1488
01:42:00,767 --> 01:42:03,444
The biggest crime is the conspiracy
 to commit murder.

1489
01:42:03,917 --> 01:42:07,618
How will you be punished
 for planning my killing?

1490
01:42:07,736 --> 01:42:09,507
What is his punishment
for executing it?

1491
01:42:09,862 --> 01:42:11,398
Hanging you is my punishment.

1492
01:42:11,673 --> 01:42:13,051
How does my dummy look?

1493
01:42:15,453 --> 01:42:16,752
Like my own reflection.

1494
01:42:23,243 --> 01:42:24,306
Come on, we are all set.

1495
01:42:24,306 --> 01:42:25,919
You will not get hurt.

1496
01:42:25,919 --> 01:42:27,771
This is just a trial.

1497
01:42:27,849 --> 01:42:28,282
What is it?

1498
01:42:28,282 --> 01:42:29,031
I have a request...

1499
01:42:29,463 --> 01:42:30,762
I want to hang instead
of the dummy.

1500
01:42:34,845 --> 01:42:36,185
I have a request too.

1501
01:42:37,207 --> 01:42:39,176
Can you handle the lever
instead of me just once?

1502
01:42:40,121 --> 01:42:42,128
Hanging a person is easier
 said than done.

1503
01:42:42,287 --> 01:42:45,200
Do you understand how difficult
it is to just hold the lever?

1504
01:42:45,435 --> 01:42:46,617
Threatening me constantly!

1505
01:42:47,012 --> 01:42:47,722
Hold on.

1506
01:42:47,760 --> 01:42:48,981
Are you ready?

1507
01:43:40,311 --> 01:43:41,060
Wait.

1508
01:43:42,437 --> 01:43:43,224
Come here.

1509
01:43:46,374 --> 01:43:47,162
Hand over your bag.

1510
01:43:48,579 --> 01:43:49,484
Check his bag.

1511
01:43:50,469 --> 01:43:52,436
Do you have to frisk us
even when we leave?

1512
01:43:52,517 --> 01:43:56,059
The officer has instructed us to frisk everybody
when they leave the premises.

1513
01:43:56,334 --> 01:43:57,123
Turn around.

1514
01:43:58,067 --> 01:43:59,051
What do you have in your pocket?

1515
01:44:07,145 --> 01:44:08,996
Plain paper?

1516
01:44:09,036 --> 01:44:09,862
Throw it...

1517
01:44:09,981 --> 01:44:10,965
Don’t waste paper.

1518
01:44:10,965 --> 01:44:12,855
I can use it for something.

1519
01:44:13,523 --> 01:44:15,649
He’s been checked.
You can go.

1520
01:44:27,178 --> 01:44:31,390
Do I look like a comedian or is Balu
cracking a joke at my expense?

1521
01:44:31,508 --> 01:44:34,383
I risked my life to bring
 this clue to you.

1522
01:44:34,709 --> 01:44:36,324
But it’s just plain paper.

1523
01:44:37,190 --> 01:44:39,236
Comrades, Yamalingam has brought
 a message from Balu.

1524
01:44:39,631 --> 01:44:40,457
Join us right away.

1525
01:44:51,127 --> 01:44:56,599
Seven prisoners are being sent
to South Africa on the 21st.

1526
01:44:56,678 --> 01:44:57,623
This is the plan.

1527
01:45:02,268 --> 01:45:03,568
Join us.

1528
01:45:09,749 --> 01:45:11,914
This is like magic.
I couldn’t see it.

1529
01:45:13,253 --> 01:45:15,458
When you write with milk on
a white paper, the letters will be invisible.

1530
01:45:15,458 --> 01:45:16,914
They become visible when
 shown over a flame.

1531
01:45:16,954 --> 01:45:18,646
We are familiar with this
 technique.

1532
01:45:18,765 --> 01:45:19,907
How is that?

1533
01:46:26,182 --> 01:46:27,245
Have you reached the destination?

1534
01:46:27,324 --> 01:46:27,914
We’ve reached.

1535
01:46:27,992 --> 01:46:30,040
Give us a call when the
van leaves the prison.

1536
01:46:30,080 --> 01:46:30,907
We will come with Balu.

1537
01:47:30,469 --> 01:47:32,477
Is the plan perfect?
-Yes.

1538
01:47:33,501 --> 01:47:36,335
The feed that you see on the right is the recording
that is being telecast in the control room.

1539
01:47:36,532 --> 01:47:38,619
The feed on the left is the live
telecast from the prison.

1540
01:47:38,619 --> 01:47:40,311
The live feed can be
viewed only by us.

1541
01:48:39,456 --> 01:48:41,937
There he is. Zoom in.

1542
01:51:32,294 --> 01:51:34,106
He’s here!

1543
01:51:37,685 --> 01:51:38,826
It is raining!

1544
01:51:38,944 --> 01:51:41,188
The feed that we are sending to the control
room doesn’t show the rain.

1545
01:51:41,306 --> 01:51:43,078
Do we have any footage
with rain?

1546
01:51:43,157 --> 01:51:44,259
We’ll be in trouble otherwise.

1547
01:52:03,472 --> 01:52:03,984
Hurry up.

1548
01:52:04,102 --> 01:52:05,873
Should we switch to a live feed
 in the control room?

1549
01:52:05,913 --> 01:52:07,331
No, Balu will get caught.

1550
01:52:27,745 --> 01:52:28,807
Allow only this vehicle to go.

1551
01:52:28,807 --> 01:52:29,634
Ok, sir.

1552
01:52:47,989 --> 01:52:49,170
Do we have any footage
of the rain?

1553
01:52:49,170 --> 01:52:50,429
We don’t have any.

1554
01:53:08,304 --> 01:53:09,405
Macaulay is in the control room!

1555
01:53:09,445 --> 01:53:11,492
It’s raining outside. What...

1556
01:53:28,185 --> 01:53:29,051
Close the check post.

1557
01:53:29,051 --> 01:53:29,761
Close the gates.

1558
01:53:29,800 --> 01:53:30,784
Hurry up.

1559
01:53:49,692 --> 01:53:50,519
Don’t shoot him.

1560
01:53:50,519 --> 01:53:51,346
We have to capture him alive.

1561
01:53:58,114 --> 01:53:59,374
Shut down all the systems.

1562
01:53:59,374 --> 01:54:00,398
Cut off all connections.

1563
01:54:01,107 --> 01:54:02,682
They will find our hideout.

1564
01:54:07,367 --> 01:54:10,555
Don’t leave any evidence behind.
Take everything away. Hurry!

1565
01:54:19,039 --> 01:54:19,827
The operation is a failure.

1566
01:54:21,284 --> 01:54:22,622
We have to vacate this
place immediately.

1567
01:54:24,709 --> 01:54:25,692
What about Balu...?

1568
01:54:26,283 --> 01:54:28,055
Go to the prison as usual
tomorrow.

1569
01:54:28,094 --> 01:54:29,275
We have to learn about
 Balu’s condition.

1570
01:54:29,708 --> 01:54:32,268
After we vacate,
I will call you myself.

1571
01:55:03,995 --> 01:55:06,121
Sir, I will surrender.

1572
01:55:46,641 --> 01:55:47,665
Carry him.

1573
01:57:07,064 --> 01:57:11,627
A comrade from Afghanistan has
responded to our post.

1574
01:57:12,628 --> 01:57:14,990
He’ll join us for a video
conference at 6 pm IST.

1575
01:57:15,074 --> 01:57:17,315
Lingam must be present for
 the video conference.

1576
01:57:24,438 --> 01:57:27,120
I am handing over charge of the control
room to the cyber crime department.

1577
01:57:28,381 --> 01:57:31,224
Lingam, come here.

1578
01:57:33,825 --> 01:57:36,467
These two prisoners helped
with the escape plan.

1579
01:57:37,308 --> 01:57:39,189
Someone from outside has hacked
the computers in the control room.

1580
01:57:40,671 --> 01:57:43,353
If you question them,
you’ll get at the truth.

1581
01:57:43,433 --> 01:57:45,674
We did all the work inside
 the prison.

1582
01:57:45,674 --> 01:57:48,036
But don’t know who
helped from the outside.

1583
01:57:50,679 --> 01:57:53,239
We’ll have an enquiry and
 submit a detailed report.

1584
01:57:53,440 --> 01:57:55,321
I will also give you a proposal
on strengthening safety measures.

1585
01:57:55,522 --> 01:57:57,003
Please give me your
feedback after that.

1586
01:58:05,210 --> 01:58:06,130
Why didn’t you come here yesterday?

1587
01:58:06,410 --> 01:58:07,852
It was raining and I wasn’t well.

1588
01:58:07,891 --> 01:58:09,612
I want to check on the progress
of work done in the hanging area.

1589
01:58:09,973 --> 01:58:10,934
Is the battery all right?

1590
01:58:13,335 --> 01:58:13,896
Afghanistan.

1591
01:58:15,697 --> 01:58:16,458
Record this.

1592
01:58:16,537 --> 01:58:19,539
I’ve been in the Tamil Nadu
prison for eight years.

1593
01:58:19,539 --> 01:58:21,341
I know Tamil well.

1594
01:58:23,343 --> 01:58:30,708
Comrade Edwin was lodged there 30 years
ago while awaiting his death sentence.

1595
01:58:30,948 --> 01:58:39,075
That is when my comrades and I prepared
 a detailed blueprint of the prison.

1596
01:58:48,041 --> 01:58:52,885
Right opposite the gallows, there is a
drainage line that runs adjacent to the compound wall.

1597
01:58:52,924 --> 01:58:56,767
We dug a trench that connected the
drainage to the area under the gallows.

1598
01:58:56,808 --> 01:59:01,251
But before we could complete this escape plan,
 they transferred comrade Edwin to another prison.

1599
01:59:01,331 --> 01:59:03,373
The trench should be
there even now.

1600
01:59:04,133 --> 01:59:08,217
Once you clear the trench, we can use it
 to get comrade Balu out.

1601
01:59:08,577 --> 01:59:11,098
We can use the trench
 to get in.

1602
01:59:11,098 --> 01:59:12,980
But, how can we get Balu out.

1603
01:59:13,020 --> 01:59:13,981
This is a risky affair.

1604
01:59:14,101 --> 01:59:16,462
You have to let them hang Balu
 in order to get him out of there.

1605
01:59:16,543 --> 01:59:23,508
Even before the hanging begins, our team should
use the trench and wait in the room below.

1606
01:59:23,548 --> 01:59:26,991
The doctor will come there to examine him only
after half an hour of the hanging.

1607
01:59:27,071 --> 01:59:28,552
That should give us
sufficient time.

1608
01:59:28,632 --> 01:59:33,435
Those of you waiting below the gallows should
free him immediately as he drops down.

1609
01:59:33,676 --> 01:59:34,476
Is this feasible?

1610
01:59:34,517 --> 01:59:35,477
It is.

1611
01:59:35,517 --> 01:59:38,079
Balu should be informed of
this plan ahead of time.

1612
01:59:38,439 --> 01:59:43,482
That’s when he can hold his breath
while hanging and co-operate with us.

1613
01:59:43,564 --> 01:59:44,604
Thank you, comrade.

1614
01:59:47,847 --> 01:59:49,367
We have to inform Balu.

1615
01:59:50,609 --> 01:59:53,330
After his attempt to escape,
they have lodged Balu at a secret place.

1616
01:59:53,371 --> 01:59:54,932
No one can meet him,
 not even me.

1617
01:59:54,972 --> 01:59:56,133
I will meet Balu myself.

1618
01:59:56,654 --> 02:00:00,977
File a petition to meet him, the way we filed one
 to meet him in Delhi’s Tihar jail.

1619
02:00:02,538 --> 02:00:05,380
I am on my rounds.
I am riding the bike.

1620
02:00:06,021 --> 02:00:06,981
I’ll call you later.

1621
02:00:09,823 --> 02:00:11,425
This is the place the Afghan
comrade was talking about.

1622
02:00:12,105 --> 02:00:14,266
‘Chennai Corporation – 18/4’

1623
02:00:14,507 --> 02:00:16,348
This is the place.

1624
02:00:26,035 --> 02:00:28,877
Macaulay wants me to pull
the lever and hang Balu.

1625
02:00:29,078 --> 02:00:30,279
You want me to do the
 same thing.

1626
02:00:30,519 --> 02:00:32,641
If the plan fails, you will also get caught
waiting below the gallows.

1627
02:00:32,641 --> 02:00:34,041
You too are in danger.

1628
02:00:35,282 --> 02:00:36,683
I will do anything for Balu.

1629
02:00:36,723 --> 02:00:37,924
…because you are in love
 with Balu.

1630
02:00:38,725 --> 02:00:40,686
You didn’t want him to die that is why
 you didn’t pull the trigger.

1631
02:00:41,087 --> 02:00:42,087
That’s not it.

1632
02:00:42,207 --> 02:00:43,609
Else, Balu is in love with you.

1633
02:00:44,410 --> 02:00:46,651
That is why he didn’t want you to die
and changed plans at the last minute.

1634
02:00:47,411 --> 02:00:48,653
That’s not possible.

1635
02:00:49,254 --> 02:00:50,373
Does that mean you’re in
 love with me?

1636
02:00:53,696 --> 02:00:56,378
You have to agree to this
 plan for my sake.

1637
02:01:06,826 --> 02:01:07,706
You continue working.

1638
02:01:07,947 --> 02:01:09,628
There’s some more work to be
done below. I’ll go there.

1639
02:01:17,674 --> 02:01:18,515
We’re here.

1640
02:01:18,555 --> 02:01:19,075
I am ready.

1641
02:01:20,356 --> 02:01:22,117
Mother, don’t disturb me.
 I’ll be back.

1642
02:02:10,554 --> 02:02:13,076
Should I come down to
help you?

1643
02:02:14,477 --> 02:02:15,838
Not necessary.
Just take care of things there.

1644
02:02:16,038 --> 02:02:16,919
I’ll do that.

1645
02:02:30,809 --> 02:02:32,051
This is the prison wall.

1646
02:02:32,651 --> 02:02:34,292
We’re inside the prison now.

1647
02:03:23,209 --> 02:03:24,410
Hope this is a safe route.

1648
02:03:24,410 --> 02:03:27,132
Even if Balu gets unconscious,
we can carry him out of here in 10 minutes.

1649
02:03:27,331 --> 02:03:28,933
On the day of hanging, all of you
wait here as early as 3.30 am.

1650
02:03:30,254 --> 02:03:34,338
As soon as he is hanged, take him down
and suspend this weight instead.

1651
02:03:34,938 --> 02:03:37,740
That’s when no one will
get suspicious.

1652
02:03:39,621 --> 02:03:40,782
Let’s go.

1653
02:03:51,671 --> 02:03:52,231
Let’s go.

1654
02:03:53,952 --> 02:03:54,512
Go.

1655
02:04:05,961 --> 02:04:07,723
Balu knows 16 languages.

1656
02:04:08,123 --> 02:04:09,564
Among these, Kuyili
knows Sanskrit.

1657
02:04:10,004 --> 02:04:12,005
We cannot communicate our plans
in Tamil inside the prison.

1658
02:04:12,446 --> 02:04:15,529
That is why I’ve written out
our plan as a Sanskrit verse.

1659
02:04:15,529 --> 02:04:16,449
Shall I read it?

1660
02:04:25,856 --> 02:04:28,859
‘We have plans of rescuing you from
 below the gallows.’

1661
02:04:29,259 --> 02:04:31,140
‘Be ready.’

1662
02:04:31,420 --> 02:04:37,264
If Balu repeats the last line,
 it means he is ready.

1663
02:04:39,386 --> 02:04:41,028
Did you meet Balu at the
 Tihar prison?

1664
02:04:41,067 --> 02:04:44,230
I’ve given you all the records.
Why are you questioning me?

1665
02:04:44,430 --> 02:04:45,511
That is the norm.

1666
02:04:45,750 --> 02:04:48,633
You met him when he was
 a prisoner on trial.

1667
02:04:48,914 --> 02:04:50,996
But now you want to meet him when
he has been sentenced to death.

1668
02:04:51,195 --> 02:04:52,115
This has political implications.

1669
02:04:52,355 --> 02:04:53,717
We cannot send you in
without questioning you.

1670
02:04:54,237 --> 02:04:54,998
Answer me.

1671
02:04:58,360 --> 02:05:01,643
A girl named Seetha Lakshmi is here to meet
Balu claiming she is his relative.

1672
02:05:01,924 --> 02:05:03,204
Did you verify the records?

1673
02:05:03,485 --> 02:05:05,165
I have. It is in order.

1674
02:05:05,206 --> 02:05:07,367
Ask her to wait there.
I’ll send Rahul.

1675
02:05:13,011 --> 02:05:13,892
Go with him.

1676
02:05:15,172 --> 02:05:16,574
Leave your bag here.
Take this token with you.

1677
02:05:33,867 --> 02:05:35,068
My name is Seetha Lakshmi.

1678
02:05:35,148 --> 02:05:36,390
I am Balu’s fiancée.

1679
02:05:36,429 --> 02:05:37,110
Balu’s…?

1680
02:05:37,509 --> 02:05:38,431
Fiancée…

1681
02:05:47,398 --> 02:05:51,561
If Balu is hanged to death, you
should hand over his body to me.

1682
02:05:51,761 --> 02:05:54,763
If you decide to bury his body,
you will be denied permission.

1683
02:05:54,963 --> 02:05:57,244
His men will raise a memorial
for him and gather crowds.

1684
02:05:57,286 --> 02:06:00,247
If you give a written statement agreeing to
 burn his body in front of the police...

1685
02:06:00,327 --> 02:06:02,769
I will make arrangements.

1686
02:06:05,130 --> 02:06:05,731
All right…

1687
02:06:10,855 --> 02:06:11,816
Sign this.

1688
02:06:17,500 --> 02:06:19,341
Take her.

1689
02:06:44,480 --> 02:06:45,601
You needn’t have come here.

1690
02:06:45,802 --> 02:06:47,123
How could I not come here?

1691
02:06:47,202 --> 02:06:51,886
I am struggling to find a legal loophole
 to save you from the gallows.

1692
02:06:53,127 --> 02:06:54,048
I will save you.

1693
02:06:54,088 --> 02:06:54,889
Try.

1694
02:06:55,849 --> 02:06:58,651
I am confident that you will take charge
and attend to everything.

1695
02:06:58,852 --> 02:07:02,653
Hoping you will not be sent to the gallows,
I am going to chant this verse.

1696
02:07:07,097 --> 02:07:15,504
‘We have plans of rescuing you from
 below the gallows.’

1697
02:07:16,545 --> 02:07:17,825
‘Be ready.’

1698
02:07:39,802 --> 02:07:42,244
In addition to the eight people on
your special frequency phone...

1699
02:07:42,244 --> 02:07:44,286
...one more person called
 Kuyili has been added.

1700
02:07:44,485 --> 02:07:46,767
That person has called Yamalingam
and sent messages as well.

1701
02:07:48,048 --> 02:07:51,611
Is it possible to call or send a message to
Yamalingam using Kuyili’s identity?

1702
02:07:51,731 --> 02:07:52,611
You can once you alter
the setting.

1703
02:07:52,693 --> 02:07:54,653
It looks like Kuyili is using Yamalingam
to help Balu escape.

1704
02:07:54,653 --> 02:07:55,334
Should we arrest her?

1705
02:07:55,373 --> 02:07:55,894
Don’t do that.

1706
02:07:56,335 --> 02:07:57,736
Let’s not disturb Yamalingam now.

1707
02:07:57,775 --> 02:07:59,418
Let’s finish the hanging.

1708
02:08:08,426 --> 02:08:09,186
The Magistrate…

1709
02:08:09,586 --> 02:08:10,307
The Circle officer…

1710
02:08:10,747 --> 02:08:11,868
The Joint Chief Secretary…

1711
02:08:12,389 --> 02:08:13,189
The Prison doctor…

1712
02:08:13,710 --> 02:08:14,990
In the presence of these officials...

1713
02:08:15,151 --> 02:08:18,473
I would like to announce the date
of execution of the death sentence.

1714
02:08:21,275 --> 02:08:23,957
There are other prisoners who
have been awarded death penalty...

1715
02:08:23,997 --> 02:08:26,199
...why are you rushing to
 execute his sentence?

1716
02:08:26,359 --> 02:08:31,243
Afzal Guru was sentenced to death
 before Ajmal Kasab.

1717
02:08:31,523 --> 02:08:33,645
But Kasab was the first
one to be hanged.

1718
02:08:33,765 --> 02:08:36,126
Also, this case does not have
any legal impediments.

1719
02:08:36,206 --> 02:08:38,367
People have opposing viewpoints
about capital punishment.

1720
02:08:38,367 --> 02:08:39,729
What is your personal opinion?

1721
02:08:39,849 --> 02:08:42,131
Whatever is advocated by the
Indian Parliament, the Supreme Court...

1722
02:08:42,131 --> 02:08:45,534
...the Constitution and the
Indian Penal Code binds me.

1723
02:08:45,613 --> 02:08:49,377
Sengodi, the first woman to immolate herself
to protest against capital punishment...

1724
02:08:49,377 --> 02:08:50,578
...belonged to Tamil Nadu.

1725
02:08:50,938 --> 02:08:54,260
Is there any political motivation behind
Balu being hanged here?

1726
02:08:54,300 --> 02:08:55,781
You have to ask the politicians.

1727
02:08:57,303 --> 02:08:58,143
This is the information.

1728
02:08:58,943 --> 02:09:01,064
Balu, who has been convicted
in the ‘attack on army’ case,

1729
02:09:01,064 --> 02:09:04,187
...is sentenced to be hanged
on the 10th at 4 am.

1730
02:09:05,228 --> 02:09:06,949
Only an experienced hangman is supposed to
 carry out the death sentence.

1731
02:09:07,030 --> 02:09:08,791
Will you not reveal the name of
the hangman to the Media?

1732
02:09:08,911 --> 02:09:10,472
You will get the details
after the hanging.

1733
02:09:11,193 --> 02:09:15,316
What if you are unable to execute
the sentence on the 10th?

1734
02:09:19,238 --> 02:09:22,042
You will get news of Balu being
hanged to death on the 10th.

1735
02:09:26,725 --> 02:09:28,045
They’ve fixed the date
for execution.

1736
02:09:28,126 --> 02:09:29,166
We have just one day.

1737
02:09:29,727 --> 02:09:32,528
Let’s get Lingam here tonight and
 firm up our plans.

1738
02:09:33,009 --> 02:09:36,251
Macaulay has informed the Press that the hanging
 will take place at 4 am on the 10th.

1739
02:09:36,572 --> 02:09:39,654
However late it gets, he wants you
to meet him before you leave.

1740
02:09:40,094 --> 02:09:41,736
One personal favour…

1741
02:09:41,776 --> 02:09:44,417
After you’ve hanged him, give me
a piece of the rope you used…

1742
02:09:44,498 --> 02:09:47,020
If we keep that at home, that will keep
 ghosts and evil spirits away.

1743
02:09:47,660 --> 02:09:50,142
It is to ward off the evil eye.

1744
02:10:12,239 --> 02:10:12,960
Sit down, Lingam.

1745
02:10:15,841 --> 02:10:17,523
He is Yamalingam,
the hangman.

1746
02:10:18,563 --> 02:10:21,926
Balu’s execution will take place
with your co-operation.

1747
02:10:23,528 --> 02:10:25,689
I need your signature on
some forms.

1748
02:10:40,379 --> 02:10:42,581
Can all of you hand me
 your mobile phones?

1749
02:10:48,786 --> 02:10:49,948
You gave me this phone.

1750
02:10:49,948 --> 02:10:50,627
Keep it there.

1751
02:10:51,628 --> 02:10:52,429
Keep it.

1752
02:10:57,953 --> 02:10:59,514
Why are you taking our
 phones?

1753
02:10:59,555 --> 02:11:01,035
There is a change in plan.

1754
02:11:01,236 --> 02:11:03,677
Balu is not going to be hanged
the day after tomorrow.

1755
02:11:03,838 --> 02:11:04,678
He will be hanged tomorrow.

1756
02:11:05,359 --> 02:11:09,722
That is at 4 am on the 9th
 instead of the 10th.

1757
02:11:12,444 --> 02:11:13,805
We have just six hours
more to go.

1758
02:11:15,006 --> 02:11:15,927
This is illegal.

1759
02:11:16,527 --> 02:11:18,088
The date given to the Press
 is 10th.

1760
02:11:18,128 --> 02:11:19,289
But you’ve secretly
 changed plans.

1761
02:11:19,570 --> 02:11:23,492
Violation of human rights is one
of the many problems.

1762
02:11:23,533 --> 02:11:24,893
Don’t get us into trouble.

1763
02:11:26,575 --> 02:11:28,056
I only want your co-operation.

1764
02:11:29,097 --> 02:11:31,178
I have made the necessary
 arrangements.

1765
02:11:31,739 --> 02:11:33,420
You will be spending
the night in prison.

1766
02:11:33,699 --> 02:11:37,102
Only after Balu is hanged can all
of you go back home.

1767
02:11:38,503 --> 02:11:40,345
Can I go home and return
 at 3 am?

1768
02:11:41,586 --> 02:11:43,307
No one will be allowed
to leave the prison.

1769
02:11:43,788 --> 02:11:45,108
We’ve closed all records
 for the day.

1770
02:11:46,950 --> 02:11:48,151
My mother will be home alone.

1771
02:11:48,151 --> 02:11:48,952
I haven’t told her.

1772
02:11:49,873 --> 02:11:52,914
I’ve already told her that you
won’t be home tonight.

1773
02:11:55,076 --> 02:11:56,477
Your families have been informed.

1774
02:11:56,717 --> 02:11:59,600
You have diabetes.
We have your tablets for you.

1775
02:11:59,680 --> 02:12:01,962
You cannot compel me to
 stay back in prison.

1776
02:12:11,729 --> 02:12:15,851
I will face the legal implications
after Balu has been hanged.

1777
02:12:16,052 --> 02:12:19,575
You can file charges, tell the Media
 or do anything else you can do.

1778
02:12:20,575 --> 02:12:22,057
Armed forces are guarding
 the prison.

1779
02:12:22,737 --> 02:12:25,579
We have intelligence reports saying Balu is
likely to make last minute attempts to escape.

1780
02:12:25,660 --> 02:12:27,140
He has done that in the past.

1781
02:12:27,380 --> 02:12:29,782
If something goes wrong with
executing the death sentence...

1782
02:12:30,143 --> 02:12:32,784
...you will be suspected of
 being an accomplice.

1783
02:12:38,829 --> 02:12:40,470
Take good care of everyone.

1784
02:12:46,354 --> 02:12:47,796
Can I be back in an hour?

1785
02:12:47,796 --> 02:12:48,556
Go away.

1786
02:13:17,779 --> 02:13:19,500
It’s been a long while.
Lingam is not here yet.

1787
02:13:20,421 --> 02:13:21,541
Check his house.

1788
02:13:41,427 --> 02:13:42,469
I need to speak to you in private.

1789
02:13:52,940 --> 02:13:53,582
Please sit down.

1790
02:14:04,052 --> 02:14:06,820
It’s my duty to formally inform
you about the date of hanging.

1791
02:14:07,782 --> 02:14:09,025
It is at 4 in the morning.

1792
02:14:10,791 --> 02:14:12,195
You have just five hours
 more to go.

1793
02:14:16,126 --> 02:14:16,728
What else?

1794
02:14:17,570 --> 02:14:19,134
I decided the time.

1795
02:14:20,298 --> 02:14:22,383
You can submit a plea for
 mercy even now.

1796
02:14:22,946 --> 02:14:24,590
I will make arrangements
 for you to stay alive.

1797
02:14:25,753 --> 02:14:27,197
The gallows are right
behind us.

1798
02:14:27,317 --> 02:14:28,923
You can hang me even now.

1799
02:14:29,363 --> 02:14:31,529
I don’t need to stay alive
by seeking your mercy.

1800
02:14:32,693 --> 02:14:33,455
You don’t fear losing your life?

1801
02:14:33,536 --> 02:14:34,298
I do.

1802
02:14:35,582 --> 02:14:37,027
I wish to stay alive too.

1803
02:14:37,949 --> 02:14:40,235
But, why do you expect me to
plead with you to stay alive?

1804
02:14:40,476 --> 02:14:42,201
You bomb places in the
 name of revolution.

1805
02:14:42,803 --> 02:14:44,447
You want to give up life
for an impossible cause.

1806
02:14:44,969 --> 02:14:47,054
All of you look like fools
 to me.

1807
02:14:48,258 --> 02:14:52,551
Your salaries are paid from
 the taxpayer’s money.

1808
02:14:52,912 --> 02:14:56,723
You serve bosses who are against people
or who are moneymaking politicians.

1809
02:14:56,723 --> 02:14:58,808
You look like a thug in uniform.

1810
02:15:01,656 --> 02:15:03,822
This is a government elected
by the people.

1811
02:15:04,224 --> 02:15:06,630
How will people choose governments,
which are against them?

1812
02:15:06,871 --> 02:15:07,834
It is possible.

1813
02:15:08,756 --> 02:15:10,000
It’s been happening.

1814
02:15:11,524 --> 02:15:13,009
I don’t understand something.

1815
02:15:13,450 --> 02:15:18,464
Youngsters today are obsessed with
Facebook, Twitter or other technologies.

1816
02:15:19,749 --> 02:15:21,554
How do they relate to
your movement?

1817
02:15:22,195 --> 02:15:23,759
You are looking down
on youngsters.

1818
02:15:24,201 --> 02:15:26,729
Several responsible youngsters are
a part of social media platforms.

1819
02:15:27,089 --> 02:15:29,054
It is possible for all of them to
come together in just a day.

1820
02:15:31,582 --> 02:15:33,227
I am not under-estimating
 your group.

1821
02:15:34,510 --> 02:15:38,522
I only suspect that even in the last
minute you will have plans to escape.

1822
02:15:39,805 --> 02:15:42,132
No one from the outside
can save you now.

1823
02:15:47,187 --> 02:15:48,631
I am a police officer.

1824
02:15:49,553 --> 02:15:51,238
I will keep changing plans.

1825
02:15:52,241 --> 02:15:55,089
Yamalingam continues to
 be my biggest challenge.

1826
02:15:56,934 --> 02:16:00,504
I am still wondering why
 he agreed to hang you.

1827
02:16:02,389 --> 02:16:06,321
If he knows you will die,
 I don’t think he will hang you.

1828
02:16:09,169 --> 02:16:15,708
I am going to send him
 a message in your presence.

1829
02:16:20,402 --> 02:16:22,528
The date of hanging is 9th.

1830
02:16:24,614 --> 02:16:29,587
We are aware of the change in date.
We’ll be waiting – Kuyili.

1831
02:16:34,843 --> 02:16:37,972
Yamalingam needs to believe that
your group is aware of this.

1832
02:16:43,708 --> 02:16:47,559
Will you tell Yamalingam not to pull the lever
because you’ll die if he does?

1833
02:16:48,642 --> 02:16:50,567
Or will you sacrifice your
 life like Bhagat Singh?

1834
02:16:53,536 --> 02:16:55,421
I want to know if you’re
‘Bhagat Singh’.

1835
02:17:01,438 --> 02:17:02,161
Tell me that before
 you leave.

1836
02:17:02,241 --> 02:17:04,447
You will know that at the gallows
at 4 in the morning.

1837
02:17:14,236 --> 02:17:17,484
When he’s down and out, he lies
drunk at his father’s memorial.

1838
02:17:37,542 --> 02:17:38,945
Macaulay has arrested me
 and kept me locked up.

1839
02:17:39,066 --> 02:17:40,229
This is not an arrest.

1840
02:17:40,430 --> 02:17:42,998
Even your father would stay for
 a day before execution.

1841
02:17:42,998 --> 02:17:44,000
Don’t you know?

1842
02:17:44,081 --> 02:17:44,843
That’s not it.

1843
02:17:44,883 --> 02:17:46,206
He has taken my phone.

1844
02:17:46,286 --> 02:17:47,531
Everyone’s phone is with me.

1845
02:17:47,811 --> 02:17:49,536
Please give me the phone.
 I’ll have a word with my mother.

1846
02:17:58,883 --> 02:18:01,250
Hurry up. I will lose my
 job if we’re caught.

1847
02:18:01,731 --> 02:18:02,934
The date of hanging is 9th.

1848
02:18:02,934 --> 02:18:05,582
We are aware of the change in date.
We’ll be waiting – Kuyili.

1849
02:18:06,706 --> 02:18:07,949
Take it back.

1850
02:18:08,029 --> 02:18:08,992
It’s all right, talk to her.

1851
02:18:08,992 --> 02:18:10,436
Macaulay is not more
important than you are.

1852
02:18:10,475 --> 02:18:12,241
Keeping your job is more
 important to me.

1853
02:18:12,442 --> 02:18:15,090
I need to wake up early.
I have a lot of work to do. You leave.

1854
02:18:20,305 --> 02:18:22,510
Sir, you will get away.

1855
02:18:31,054 --> 02:18:32,338
Yamalingam has read the message.

1856
02:18:33,021 --> 02:18:34,906
He became happy after
 reading it.

1857
02:18:40,643 --> 02:18:44,653
You’ve played an important role
during this entire operation.

1858
02:18:45,135 --> 02:18:46,901
Please appreciate me after
 Balu has been hanged.

1859
02:18:53,920 --> 02:18:55,124
Did you find him?
– No.

1860
02:18:55,806 --> 02:18:58,052
Lingam’s mother has also
 been looking for him.

1861
02:18:59,496 --> 02:19:00,900
Could it be some other problem?

1862
02:19:05,313 --> 02:19:06,276
Let’s get to the prison.

1863
02:19:06,597 --> 02:19:10,447
If you find someone unauthorised entering
the prison premises, shoot at sight.

1864
02:20:13,949 --> 02:20:14,791
What’s your name?

1865
02:20:14,791 --> 02:20:16,597
Balusamy alias Balu…

1866
02:20:22,975 --> 02:20:25,703
A bullet wound below the
 left shoulder blade.

1867
02:20:27,749 --> 02:20:30,196
A cut mark behind the
right shoulder blade…

1868
02:22:15,657 --> 02:22:17,102
Case Number: 457

1869
02:22:17,142 --> 02:22:22,276
As per the Indian Penal Code 121, 122, 396,
the Special Fast Track Court...

1870
02:22:22,276 --> 02:22:24,001
...had sentenced you to
 death by hanging.

1871
02:22:24,040 --> 02:22:29,657
You had submitted a petition to be considered
a war criminal and to be shot.

1872
02:22:30,058 --> 02:22:34,792
The Supreme Court had dismissed your petition
 and confirmed death by hanging on three counts.

1873
02:22:35,714 --> 02:22:39,365
Under charges of treason and three other categories
 under which death penalty is awarded...

1874
02:22:39,365 --> 02:22:41,731
...your sentence is about
 to be executed.

1875
02:22:44,258 --> 02:22:46,665
Do you have anything to
 say before you die?

1876
02:22:49,875 --> 02:22:52,802
It’s a time and age where one is
confused and does not know...

1877
02:22:52,802 --> 02:22:55,811
...who he is fighting or
shedding blood for…

1878
02:22:55,811 --> 02:23:00,064
The capitalist approach is the common
enemy and cause for all problems.

1879
02:23:01,227 --> 02:23:04,316
Socialism is the only way
 to free people.

1880
02:23:05,881 --> 02:23:11,737
I whole-heartedly give up my life for
people in the world to realise this.

1881
02:23:12,780 --> 02:23:14,546
Long live the Revolution!

1882
02:26:18,997 --> 02:26:20,040
We’re unable to open the door.

1883
02:26:20,160 --> 02:26:21,404
It’s locked from the inside.

1884
02:27:47,250 --> 02:27:49,776
He’s all right. Let him go.

1885
02:27:50,058 --> 02:27:52,345
He’s fine.
Let him go, sir.

1886
02:27:52,345 --> 02:27:54,109
Go away.

1887
02:28:29,493 --> 02:28:30,736
They’re gone.

1888
02:28:34,466 --> 02:28:35,951
No one can harm you.

1889
02:28:38,039 --> 02:28:44,978
Sir, come. Let’s go.

1890
02:29:30,831 --> 02:29:32,397
I have something to say, sir.

1891
02:29:32,718 --> 02:29:34,563
You would quote Mao Zedong often…

1892
02:29:35,325 --> 02:29:40,700
...that, life lived for your own self is as effortless
as a feather blown around in the wind…

1893
02:29:41,061 --> 02:29:45,153
But living your life for people who depend
on you, is a mountainous task.

1894
02:29:45,674 --> 02:29:47,680
Do you know the extent
of its reach today?

1895
02:29:50,488 --> 02:29:52,213
You would say I always
 speak the truth.

1896
02:29:52,695 --> 02:29:54,139
Don’t say anything.

1897
02:29:55,663 --> 02:29:56,386
I salute you.
