1
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:14,409
For love... for your wait...

2
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:16,821
Okay, did you get
the message or not?

3
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:22,019
For some good wait...

4
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,222
It is good, isn't it?
- They are very good.

5
00:04:33,506 --> 00:04:34,837
Come on.

6
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:35,999
Yes.

7
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:41,836
Hey, we have come.

8
00:04:41,914 --> 00:04:44,314
Hello, Babu. Congratulations.
- How are you?

9
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:45,851
First class.
- Come, Babu. How was it?

10
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:47,385
We spent four months nicely.

11
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:48,852
What is the matter, Babu?
- All right.

12
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:50,855
We were waiting for you
with a bated breath.

13
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:52,390
Why? Which train was waiting for us?

14
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,857
Listen...

15
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,052
He has a trio. Throw the cards.

16
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,188
Thank you, Babu.
- Babu...

17
00:04:58,398 --> 00:05:00,457
There are few things
that only you can do.

18
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,466
And therefore, I was
waiting for you.

19
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,337
Speak clearly.

20
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:08,340
You are the only person
who seems to be honest.

21
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:09,807
Thanks for the compliment.

22
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:11,275
Look at the others.

23
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:13,471
They seem to be thieves,
vagrants and murderers.

24
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:15,813
Listen...

25
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:17,807
You are a rich man from today.

26
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:20,342
You name is Mr. Babulal Mehta.

27
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,881
These are the keys to your car.

28
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:30,161
And this is your car. You will
go to the bank from tomorrow.

29
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:34,299
But like an honest customer.
And going to the bank...

30
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:36,494
Oh... such a ring?

31
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:40,167
Is it about some girl?

32
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,500
This means that it is surely there.

33
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:49,177
No, Babu. It is nothing like that.

34
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:51,178
What is the matter?

35
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:52,841
It is a symbol.

36
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:56,914
Of a child. A child who has expired.

37
00:05:58,391 --> 00:06:03,124
Twenty years from now. When
he was just five years ago.

38
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,330
Away from his parents.

39
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:12,329
Mother, father, sister,
he remembers nothing.

40
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:16,264
This was the only symbol left.

41
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:21,206
I am sorry.

42
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:27,148
Sir... is this Babu some relative
or brother of yours?

43
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,822
Don't ask me all this.

44
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,825
Life is strange too.

45
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:36,486
I and Babu were childhood friends.

46
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:38,824
We were together, we
studied together.

47
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:41,226
And we did mischief together too.

48
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,370
One day, we two picked some
one's pocket as a joke.

49
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:46,837
And we were caught.

50
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,232
I was released, because
my father was alive.

51
00:06:51,377 --> 00:06:52,844
But Babu stayed there.

52
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:58,183
I still remember. When
my daddy released me...

53
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,113
...and took me away, he shouted
behind the bars...

54
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:03,451
...'Father... please take
me away from here.'

55
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:09,317
Even I am your son, I will never
do anything like this.

56
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:11,386
Did your father not
have him released?

57
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:13,798
No. In fact, when he came back...

58
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:16,334
...from the reform school, nobody...

59
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:18,461
...spoke to him, they tainted him...

60
00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:22,136
...as a thief and spat on his face.

61
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:31,314
I tried to convince him a lot.
But Babu had changed.

62
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:40,314
Oh... the giver... all these
flowers are silent...

63
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:47,831
Babu...

64
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,233
Come with me.

65
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:57,300
Do you want to take me to
the prison once again?

66
00:07:57,376 --> 00:07:59,435
No, the police station.

67
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:01,837
Why? I didn't do anything this time.

68
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:04,773
I want to speak to you.

69
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:08,449
I don't have any time
for police lectures.

70
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,789
Listen, Babu.

71
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:15,387
Not as a police man, but come
as a friend at least.

72
00:08:16,863 --> 00:08:18,125
Babu... please...

73
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:28,136
I tell you again, Babu,
leave such a life.

74
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:30,466
This is the second time
that you were in prison.

75
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:33,869
Babu... we were friends as children.

76
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,406
We were brought up together
and played together.

77
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:41,479
It is a coincidence that I am at
this side of the wall of law.

78
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:45,153
I want you to come to
this side of the law.

79
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:48,825
Babu... there is nothing except
insults and destruction that side.

80
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,226
There is nothing at all.

81
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,355
I know that there is just
destruction here.

82
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,324
But there is no other way out too.

83
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,100
You must be remembering that...

84
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:05,109
...when I came out of prison the
first time, I came to you.

85
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:10,305
And you even gave me
a job, at a grocer's.

86
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:14,114
Didn't I tell you not to keep
such a thief in the house?

87
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,252
But you didn't listen to me at all.

88
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:17,789
I don't know anything now.

89
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:19,381
Make him give back my necklace.

90
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,187
Don't worry, Neela's mother.

91
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,251
If he has stolen your necklace...

92
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:25,456
...I will have even his
father give it back.

93
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:28,466
Hey... why don't you speak? Where
have you hidden the necklace?

94
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:33,338
I haven't even seen her necklace.

95
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:34,805
When the police will
beat him, he will...

96
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:37,399
...himself tell where he
has hidden the necklace.

97
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:40,471
Inspector... come... please come...

98
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:44,414
See this... see what
your man has done.

99
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:46,351
He has stolen my wife's necklace.

100
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,818
And you said...

101
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:50,014
Just a minute. Just a minute.
Tell me. Babu.

102
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,215
What is the matter?

103
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:56,293
I have told him that I didn't
even see his necklace.

104
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:59,297
Wow. He has said it and
you listen to him?

105
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,992
I tell you, search him out.

106
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:07,171
Sir... if you don't search
him, I will report you.

107
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:08,840
Silent...

108
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:11,843
I know what my duty is.

109
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:22,009
Excuse me, Babu. This is my duty.

110
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:30,460
Tell me the truth. Maybe,
I will be able to save you.

111
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:05,363
Babu doesn't have the necklace.

112
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:07,831
Do you think that he
is a immature thief...

113
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,834
...that he will just
rob the necklace...

114
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:11,836
...and put it in his pocket?
Inspector...

115
00:11:11,904 --> 00:11:13,166
...he must have hidden it somewhere.

116
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,502
Did you wear this necklace?

117
00:11:19,912 --> 00:11:22,176
Yes, I was in a hurry and
I forgot to tell you.

118
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:26,373
Why didn't you tell
us and go? Go inside!

119
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:33,252
The world said that I
was a thief and you...

120
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:36,260
My childhood friend,
even you were scared.

121
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:38,920
Even you looked at me
from suspicious eyes.

122
00:11:39,398 --> 00:11:40,865
You didn't believe me anymore...

123
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:42,924
...and I didn't believe
in the world anymore.

124
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:45,193
See. You try to forget everything.

125
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:47,872
Keep some faith in the world.

126
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,406
There is nicety and
nice people here too.

127
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:52,341
That may be the case,
but I never saw it.

128
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:56,538
I just now that my father was
poor and your father, rich.

129
00:11:57,483 --> 00:12:00,145
And if I were born in your house...

130
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,153
...today, you would be
coming out of prison...

131
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:03,813
...and maybe, wearing this uniform...

132
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:05,356
...I would be having this badge too.

133
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:07,415
Driver... stop the car.

134
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:15,827
It's all a matter of bread.

135
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:18,836
As I sing for the sake
of it on the streets.

136
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:31,371
It's your pleasure if
you want to give something.

137
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:34,851
Or if not, then even
you're your pleasure.

138
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,856
I'm not stealing but
the whole world is.

139
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,518
But, I won't do that
for the sake of bread.

140
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:45,454
No. I don't ever want to do that.

141
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,030
Babu...

142
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:56,267
Babu has come... Babu has come.

143
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:57,874
So, what is the state
of the company?

144
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,342
Very good. First class.

145
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:00,810
Did anyone do any mischief?

146
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,474
No, all of us are very good boys.
- Very good.

147
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:05,407
Where had you gone for so many days?

148
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:06,815
I had gone...

149
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:10,486
I had gone to a new world.

150
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:12,016
New world?
- Yes.

151
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:13,820
Where everyone is equal.

152
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:17,226
They live equally, wear
equally and eat equally.

153
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:18,820
Then, do take me over there.

154
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:22,357
No... no... God shouldn't do it.

155
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:24,425
There will be a new world for you.

156
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:28,169
Maybe... maybe you will make it.

157
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:31,172
But what mistake is
there in this world?

158
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:34,439
In this world?

159
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:37,315
There are a lot of mistakes
in this world.

160
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:39,510
The mistake in this world is that;

161
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:41,519
it's something from inside
and something else from out.

162
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:44,389
It is different from up,
down and the sides.

163
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:47,357
Hey, drum boy, get the drum.

164
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,854
Just like there is a
story in the drum.

165
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:54,399
A story in the drum?

166
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:55,865
A story in the drum?

167
00:13:55,935 --> 00:14:00,804
It plays like this! Yes!
It plays like this!

168
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:06,472
It plays like this,
o world, your drum.

169
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,483
As loud the voice,
so big the story.

170
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:39,505
Look at them, they
walk so straight.

171
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:43,905
They have a TILAK on their
forehead, red in color.

172
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:56,326
They sing about wealth, and
their tune is of hymns.

173
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:03,392
And if you ask their actions,
it is a circle.

174
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:33,296
One lives and enjoys
in the palaces.

175
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:37,233
One spends their life
on the foot paths.

176
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:49,841
Even their dogs move
around in a car.

177
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:57,320
We are the ones who get
kicked like a football.

178
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:30,149
What has happened to us,
it is the past.

179
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:34,022
But the one who will
grow up after me.

180
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:48,238
I hope that they don't
see this scene.

181
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:55,437
Whatever is my cost, shouldn't
be yours too.

182
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,126
See Babu...

183
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,800
As much pain you have in your
heart for these children...

184
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,132
...I have that same pain
in my heart for you.

185
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:20,799
Nothing has gone wrong even now.

186
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:23,802
The world is surely
a drum, but the...

187
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,140
...voice is in the hands
of the player.

188
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:32,146
As the player, so the voice,
Babu, please change.

189
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:42,427
And at three twelve, you will
stand at the door. - Very good.

190
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,829
I will come at three twenty.

191
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,023
And at three twenty five...

192
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:48,498
Babu will be at the door of the
bank, with his engine running.

193
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:50,832
Babu will not be there.

194
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:52,834
What do you mean?

195
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:55,438
I mean that I don't want
to work with you anymore.

196
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:57,838
Then which gang do you want to join?

197
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:01,110
I have decided that I don't
want to work in this now.

198
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,109
Babu... this isn't a time to joke.

199
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:07,113
I am not joking at all.

200
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:16,293
You cannot leave this gang
at all now. Understood?

201
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:19,454
And what if I want to leave it?

202
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:23,392
You cannot leave your gang now.

203
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:26,463
And if you leave it, you
will be in a loss.

204
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:29,198
And we don't want it, understood?

205
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,805
Sir. One of Balli's gang's men has...

206
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:40,408
...been caught along with the goods.
- Good.

207
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:46,021
That's very good. Go and
get ready for the raid.

208
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:54,332
Then? Then? Oh my God!

209
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:58,025
This is strange. Khairati
has been caught. - What?

210
00:18:58,103 --> 00:19:00,094
Yes. Jeevan gave me
the code right away.

211
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:02,231
He told me that everyone is locked
up in the princess street prison.

212
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:04,104
And only he was able to run away.

213
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:05,767
Then this bank hold up has gone too.

214
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:07,778
This is strange, people
like Jeevan...

215
00:19:07,846 --> 00:19:08,938
...and Khairati have been caught?

216
00:19:09,014 --> 00:19:11,107
It is possible that Babu...
- Even I think so.

217
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:13,251
That wretch Babu must
have tipped the police.

218
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:14,785
Mehmood... Kumar...

219
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:16,787
We don't have even
a moment to waste.

220
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:19,119
Wherever we have kept the
smuggled goods, arrange it.

221
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:20,791
This place is not free
from danger too.

222
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:22,850
And that whisky case?
- Yes, that too.

223
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:26,262
Who is it?
- Jeevan...

224
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:27,798
Come, Jeevan.

225
00:19:29,868 --> 00:19:30,960
Police...

226
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:33,300
Don't you dare move, I
will shoot. Hand's up.

227
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:34,804
Police... police...

228
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:36,805
Don't you dare...

229
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:39,002
Move.

230
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:40,806
Even if you take on step,
I will shoot.

231
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:46,310
Move...

232
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:51,481
Constable, take all of them.

233
00:19:58,163 --> 00:19:59,323
Babu...

234
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:03,231
For what? - Because all of Balli's
gang has been caught.

235
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:06,164
And he thinks that you have
informed about them.

236
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:07,829
Have they gone crazy?

237
00:20:07,906 --> 00:20:09,430
You know that I didn't do all this.

238
00:20:10,175 --> 00:20:12,507
I know it, but Balli will
not understand all this.

239
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:17,178
Before, Balli comes to his senses,
escape from here.

240
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,850
He has been released on bail.

241
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:22,182
And maybe, he will be thirsting
for your blood.

242
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:25,185
Therefore, I want to send
you away from here.

243
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:27,254
I think that I will
have to convince him.

244
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:30,056
Or else, he will keep
on suspecting me.

245
00:20:30,195 --> 00:20:31,389
According to me, this will be wrong.

246
00:20:31,463 --> 00:20:34,057
But when you are going, take care.

247
00:20:34,132 --> 00:20:37,363
This can never happen. Any
way, Shyam, thank you.

248
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:55,886
Where are everyone?

249
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:57,080
Where is everyone?
- Babu...

250
00:20:57,155 --> 00:20:58,884
You shouldn't have come here, Babu.

251
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:01,152
Why?
- Balli will kill you.

252
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,227
He is a fool. He thinks
that I had them caught.

253
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:07,424
Where is Balli? Where
is he? Balli! Balli!

254
00:21:13,905 --> 00:21:15,167
Balli!

255
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:25,441
What is the matter, Balli?

256
00:21:31,923 --> 00:21:35,381
See, you are suspecting me. I
didn't report to the police.

257
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:39,191
Babu... now I will report
you to the almighty.

258
00:21:39,264 --> 00:21:42,392
Daddy... Mangla... Kamala...
is there anyone here?

259
00:21:45,203 --> 00:21:50,869
Don't be foolish. I am not that
wretch to fool my friends.

260
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:52,204
You are blabbering.

261
00:21:52,544 --> 00:21:55,206
Because you can see your
death in your front.

262
00:22:05,223 --> 00:22:06,349
See, Balli.

263
00:22:07,025 --> 00:22:11,155
I don't fear death,
you or this knife.

264
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:13,489
And I haven't come
to fight with you.

265
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:16,995
Throw that knife away. Throw it.

266
00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:32,039
Babu... I will kill you.

267
00:22:35,454 --> 00:22:37,513
Balli... let me go...
let me go, Balli.

268
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:42,357
I tell you. Let me go, Balli.

269
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:48,456
I had told you to let me go.

270
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:50,868
Get up. Get up, Balli.

271
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:57,203
Balli... Balli...

272
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:38,848
What happened?

273
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:40,845
Babu... Babu...

274
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:47,857
Taxi...

275
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:55,195
Babu made Balli understand a lot.

276
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:57,525
But Balli didn't listen
to him at all.

277
00:23:57,936 --> 00:23:59,460
He was enraged.

278
00:23:59,871 --> 00:24:02,396
Babu told him again and
again to throw the knife.

279
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:06,402
And in the end, to save
himself, Babu...

280
00:24:06,978 --> 00:24:10,414
Okay. See, you two come to
me to the police station.

281
00:24:10,882 --> 00:24:12,873
I want to record your statement.

282
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:16,818
Constable...

283
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:20,483
Two men stay there. The
rest come with me.

284
00:24:22,427 --> 00:24:23,826
You please come with me.

285
00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:16,313
So, how's Banta Singh?

286
00:25:29,427 --> 00:25:30,826
What are you staring at?

287
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:33,831
Didn't you ever see a man before?

288
00:25:49,514 --> 00:25:52,506
You will tire standing.
Come and sit here.

289
00:26:13,004 --> 00:26:15,199
We have searched for you with
great difficulty, sir.

290
00:26:15,273 --> 00:26:16,399
Who are you?

291
00:26:19,344 --> 00:26:24,407
Who told you that my name is Babu?

292
00:26:24,983 --> 00:26:27,474
We call everyone who wears
a coat and pant as Babu.

293
00:26:28,219 --> 00:26:31,347
I have just one question.
Will I get any alms?

294
00:26:35,894 --> 00:26:37,020
Bless you.

295
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:44,494
Eat something. Your
fear will go away.

296
00:26:45,904 --> 00:26:49,169
Don't worry. Everyone is our own.

297
00:26:57,515 --> 00:26:58,846
Please come, constable.

298
00:26:58,917 --> 00:26:59,941
What is the matter?

299
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:01,178
Give me a tea.

300
00:27:01,252 --> 00:27:03,379
Tell me, what is the government
hunting today?

301
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,446
The same thing that
goes on everyday.

302
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,121
A killer has run away till here.

303
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:09,251
A killer? Who is he?
How is he to look at?

304
00:27:09,327 --> 00:27:11,386
You give me the tea. How are
you concerned with it?

305
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:13,192
Here, sir. The tea is here for you.

306
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:17,129
Take two puffs, your
body will be warm.

307
00:27:20,005 --> 00:27:22,200
It isn't so cold in Bombay.

308
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:25,137
What do I know about it?

309
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:29,005
You have come from Bombay
and don't know this much?

310
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:33,409
Who told you that I have
come from Bombay?

311
00:27:33,885 --> 00:27:36,012
Even I have stayed there
for a couple of days.

312
00:27:36,287 --> 00:27:38,482
I have wandered there about a lot.

313
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:41,489
I had understood about
you in one gaze.

314
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:47,221
What else have you understood
about me?

315
00:27:49,901 --> 00:27:51,425
You fear the police a lot.

316
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:53,436
Every honest man fears a lot.

317
00:27:53,905 --> 00:27:56,169
Even I am a very honest man.

318
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,371
You seem to very smart.

319
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:05,975
Babu...

320
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:10,780
What if these same police
men start saluting you?

321
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,791
They start saluting me?

322
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:20,990
Yes. I have a plan.

323
00:28:23,301 --> 00:28:24,393
What kind of plan?

324
00:28:26,471 --> 00:28:30,134
Even walls have ears.
Come outside with me.

325
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:46,417
See there. That.

326
00:28:46,491 --> 00:28:49,221
The village there is named Dhalpur.

327
00:28:49,427 --> 00:28:52,487
And this is the river Vyas,
which passes through this.

328
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:57,161
And the house of the biggest
landlord of this village is that.

329
00:28:57,435 --> 00:28:58,834
Tell me more about him.

330
00:29:00,105 --> 00:29:02,096
That landlord had just one son.

331
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:05,173
Who was lost twenty years ago.

332
00:29:05,844 --> 00:29:08,972
At that time, his age was something
like five or six years.

333
00:29:09,848 --> 00:29:12,316
He wasn't found even after
a lot of searching.

334
00:29:13,318 --> 00:29:17,379
I wish you to become that
landlord's lost son.

335
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:22,921
The landlord's lost son?
I didn't understand.

336
00:29:22,994 --> 00:29:24,188
What is your age?

337
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:25,786
Something like 25, 26, 27.

338
00:29:25,864 --> 00:29:28,196
Very good, bless you.

339
00:29:31,002 --> 00:29:34,199
If you say that you are that
landlord's lost son...

340
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:35,796
Can anyone refuse you?

341
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:39,469
How can this be possible?
A man gets caught.

342
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:41,277
And then... even I can
commit a mistake.

343
00:29:41,346 --> 00:29:43,280
You don't have to live
there throughout life.

344
00:29:43,348 --> 00:29:44,815
It is just a matter
of a month or two.

345
00:29:45,483 --> 00:29:47,815
There are always a lakh or a half...

346
00:29:47,886 --> 00:29:52,823
...the safe of that old landlord.
You will go like a honest...

347
00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:57,487
...and good child to your old
parents and serve them.

348
00:29:58,029 --> 00:29:59,826
And while serving,
one day, you will...

349
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:03,334
...lessen the burden of
the safe. Don't worry.

350
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:06,427
As soon as you come out, I
will take half the burden.

351
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:10,166
And there is something
special in it too.

352
00:30:10,441 --> 00:30:13,842
Even if the Bombay police sniff
you out and come till here...

353
00:30:13,912 --> 00:30:16,244
...Babu will have vanished.

354
00:30:20,051 --> 00:30:24,385
But how will this happen?
I... their son...

355
00:30:24,455 --> 00:30:25,854
Leave all this to me.

356
00:30:26,391 --> 00:30:30,521
I will tell you all that a five
year old child should remember.

357
00:30:43,074 --> 00:30:45,542
I am saying... Sir...
please come here...

358
00:30:46,477 --> 00:30:49,207
Uncle... oh uncle...

359
00:30:49,547 --> 00:30:51,879
You uncle, I told you
a thousand times...

360
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:54,544
...not to call me a uncle,
call me the accountant.

361
00:30:54,953 --> 00:30:57,547
Okay. Give this letter
to the Shahji.

362
00:30:57,956 --> 00:30:59,890
Then I will call you
an accountant, uncle.

363
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:04,156
Get lost. Get lost from here.

364
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:14,338
Dear father. I am coming home.

365
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:20,844
Your son, Kundan.

366
00:31:21,913 --> 00:31:25,440
Dear father. I am coming home.
Your son, Kundan.

367
00:31:26,017 --> 00:31:28,178
Oh... this is the son's letter.

368
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:31,447
Shahji... oh... Shahji...

369
00:31:31,923 --> 00:31:33,049
It is a miracle.

370
00:31:33,124 --> 00:31:34,250
What happened?

371
00:31:34,325 --> 00:31:36,520
Magic, a miracle. Kundan's letter.
Younger brother's letter.

372
00:31:37,362 --> 00:31:41,196
Kundan's letter? What are
you blabbering, uncle?

373
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:42,392
What I am saying is correct.

374
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:44,059
If it is wrong, your head
and my shoe. - What?

375
00:31:44,135 --> 00:31:47,036
No. My head and shoe.
See this. Read this.

376
00:31:47,538 --> 00:31:48,869
Dear father.

377
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:53,536
I came to know today that I
have a father and a mother.

378
00:31:54,212 --> 00:31:59,548
I am coming home. Your son, Kundan.

379
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:01,816
Your son, Kundan...

380
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:10,156
Do you hear? Do you hear?

381
00:32:10,995 --> 00:32:12,826
Oh! Rukmani...

382
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:16,825
What? What happened?

383
00:32:19,304 --> 00:32:20,828
Say something.

384
00:32:21,306 --> 00:32:23,433
Crazy woman, ask something
else from God today.

385
00:32:23,908 --> 00:32:25,170
What happened?

386
00:32:25,243 --> 00:32:29,304
Your son is arriving.
Your son. Yes. Kundan.

387
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,847
Your son is arriving.

388
00:32:33,017 --> 00:32:36,851
Kundan... where is he?
Where is Kundan?

389
00:32:36,921 --> 00:32:38,855
Kundan hasn't come,
his letter has come.

390
00:32:38,923 --> 00:32:42,450
His letter has come? My
son's letter has come...

391
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:54,870
I am blind...

392
00:32:55,473 --> 00:33:00,410
After twenty years,
our son misses us.

393
00:33:01,879 --> 00:33:06,145
When mother cried and became
blind and father...

394
00:33:07,885 --> 00:33:09,216
Don't say like this...

395
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:16,154
God knows what happened to my Ram
in the twenty years penance.

396
00:33:17,028 --> 00:33:21,089
Let him come once at least.
Let me embrace him.

397
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:24,297
Uncle. Go and arrange
for my son's arrival.

398
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:25,836
Go and tell all the people.

399
00:33:25,903 --> 00:33:27,837
Hey... where is Maya? Maya?

400
00:33:27,905 --> 00:33:29,167
Maya? Maya? Where has she gone?

401
00:33:30,908 --> 00:33:32,842
Why are you standing here?
Go and arrange.

402
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:35,105
If my life is spared, can I
tell you something? - Yes?

403
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,847
If you ask me, I am
a bit suspicious.

404
00:33:36,914 --> 00:33:38,313
Suspicious? About what?

405
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:39,850
Whether this letter
is Kundan's or not.

406
00:33:39,917 --> 00:33:41,908
When Kundan was lost,
was he educated?

407
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:43,346
Uncle...

408
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:44,854
You mean to say that Kundan has...

409
00:33:44,922 --> 00:33:46,913
...been a donkey for all his
twenty years like you?

410
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:48,385
A donkey's child doesn't
change face.

411
00:33:48,459 --> 00:33:50,450
But a man's child does, understood?

412
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:52,189
How will you recognize him?

413
00:33:52,263 --> 00:33:54,458
Uncle... he is my son,
I will recognize him.

414
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:56,193
Come on.
- Come on.

415
00:33:57,935 --> 00:34:00,335
These are your clothes and
this is your luggage.

416
00:34:01,305 --> 00:34:04,399
I have spent all my money
on this. Go, be victorious.

417
00:34:04,475 --> 00:34:07,410
No. I will not be able to do this.
I am tired of this thing.

418
00:34:07,478 --> 00:34:09,412
One robbery after the other.
I want to finish this cycle.

419
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,811
Are you crazy?

420
00:34:11,482 --> 00:34:12,813
See, Babu.

421
00:34:13,151 --> 00:34:15,312
I have known you in two days.

422
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:18,151
And in two days, the police
will catch you.

423
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:22,316
But it won't give you what I am.

424
00:34:23,027 --> 00:34:27,327
Such a huge house, parents,
and wealth.

425
00:34:28,032 --> 00:34:29,226
A lot of wealth.

426
00:34:31,169 --> 00:34:33,501
I had prepared these
maps previously.

427
00:34:34,439 --> 00:34:36,498
I just needed a young man like you.

428
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:39,833
You will have to go now.

429
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:42,505
You don't have any other way out.

430
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:45,007
Go.

431
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,404
Bless you, younger sir...

432
00:35:17,482 --> 00:35:19,814
Younger sir?
- No, elder sir.

433
00:35:19,884 --> 00:35:21,818
Younger sir, elder sir...

434
00:35:22,153 --> 00:35:23,814
Those same habits of your childhood.

435
00:35:23,888 --> 00:35:25,355
That same simplicity.

436
00:35:25,423 --> 00:35:26,822
Didn't I recognize you?
- Recognize me?

437
00:35:26,891 --> 00:35:29,155
Come on. Come on.
- Where? - Come on friend.

438
00:35:29,227 --> 00:35:35,166
Come on friend?
- Sir, I am not an immature person.

439
00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:37,224
Come on. Come on, Kundan.

440
00:35:37,902 --> 00:35:41,235
You won't change? Get lost.
- Get lost!

441
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:46,501
Hey... take my luggage down.
This one. Very good.

442
00:35:49,514 --> 00:35:51,175
Nobody has come to pick me up.

443
00:35:51,249 --> 00:35:52,841
Nobody has come to pick him up?

444
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:56,011
Kundan...

445
00:35:56,921 --> 00:35:58,013
Uncle...

446
00:35:58,089 --> 00:35:59,181
Oh!

447
00:36:02,393 --> 00:36:03,792
Father didn't come?

448
00:36:03,861 --> 00:36:05,123
He couldn't tolerate this happiness.

449
00:36:05,196 --> 00:36:07,187
Therefore, he didn't come.
- Okay. My luggage.

450
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,333
Congratulations to you too.

451
00:36:44,902 --> 00:36:46,301
God has listened to me in the end.

452
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,837
Everyone should have such a fate.

453
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:06,381
Kundan...

454
00:37:07,325 --> 00:37:08,792
Kundan...

455
00:37:19,337 --> 00:37:23,467
Greeting, Shahji...
- Greetings, Shahji...

456
00:37:23,874 --> 00:37:25,273
Oh... just wait for a minute.

457
00:37:25,343 --> 00:37:26,810
Son, do you recognize him?
- No.

458
00:37:26,877 --> 00:37:28,003
He is Mr. Das.

459
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,808
How will you recognize him?
You were young at that time.

460
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,814
Yes. I was very young.

461
00:37:34,018 --> 00:37:36,213
Son... put some money.
- Yes, here you are.

462
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:38,820
Come.

463
00:37:53,904 --> 00:37:58,238
Kundan... Kundan... my son...

464
00:38:04,315 --> 00:38:06,306
Kundan... Kundan...

465
00:38:06,851 --> 00:38:10,787
Oh god. Just like my heart
knows peace today...

466
00:38:10,855 --> 00:38:13,449
...just like that, a hundred
mothers should have it.

467
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:19,122
I have given you much
sadness, mother.

468
00:38:20,331 --> 00:38:24,131
Please don't say like this, son.
This was about deeds.

469
00:38:24,869 --> 00:38:29,203
It was about to happen. Even
Lord Rama couldn't change it.

470
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:31,805
I say...

471
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:34,810
For one moment, just
for one moment...

472
00:38:34,879 --> 00:38:37,814
...may God give me eyes, then I...

473
00:38:37,882 --> 00:38:41,477
...will place you in my
mind for every birth.

474
00:38:42,887 --> 00:38:44,013
Kalsu...

475
00:38:44,889 --> 00:38:46,015
Kalsu...

476
00:38:46,223 --> 00:38:49,488
Become my eyes and tell
me how my son seems.

477
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:54,359
Rukmini... your son is one in
a lakh. He one in a lakh.

478
00:38:54,432 --> 00:38:57,230
Really? Then it is good
that I don't have eyes.

479
00:38:57,301 --> 00:38:58,825
Or else, I would put bad
intentions on my son.

480
00:38:58,903 --> 00:39:01,167
He looks exactly like
his paternal grandpa.

481
00:39:01,238 --> 00:39:02,364
Oh! Did the paternal grandpa
have any looks?

482
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,771
He must have gone on his
maternal grandfather.

483
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:06,435
Okay, may he look like his
maternal grandfather.

484
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:09,369
But he shouldn't have
brains like him. - See!

485
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:14,841
Maya is not to be seen anywhere.

486
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:33,200
You are Maya? How are you, Maya

487
00:39:37,475 --> 00:39:38,806
Eat a bit more.

488
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:40,400
No. I am not hungry anymore.

489
00:39:40,478 --> 00:39:42,469
Exactly like that.
Exactly like that.

490
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,212
You used to say no like
this when you were young.

491
00:39:45,282 --> 00:39:47,477
And I used to stuff the
food into your mouth.

492
00:39:48,352 --> 00:39:50,479
I think that I will have
to do it now too.

493
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:55,325
Here, eat it. Come on.
- I am not a kid.

494
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:59,158
You might be big for someone else.
But, you're the same for me.

495
00:39:59,363 --> 00:40:02,161
Here, have it. Have one more.
- Okay.

496
00:40:03,033 --> 00:40:05,501
I remember that day even today.

497
00:40:07,004 --> 00:40:09,495
You got up in the middle of the
night and asked for Jalebees (sweets).

498
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:12,842
Now, a house is a house.

499
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,844
It isn't a hotel or a shop.

500
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:19,512
I was in a major problem
and you were crying.

501
00:40:21,452 --> 00:40:24,182
Then I made Jalebees for you
in the middle of the night.

502
00:40:25,055 --> 00:40:26,249
Do you remember that?

503
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:29,323
I don't remember all that,
but I remember...

504
00:40:29,393 --> 00:40:34,387
...that I used to trouble you a
lot and made life hell for you.

505
00:40:34,465 --> 00:40:35,864
But there was one thing
which I used...

506
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:38,527
...to remember and cry
a lot when I was alone.

507
00:40:39,069 --> 00:40:42,197
Your enemies may cry!

508
00:40:42,473 --> 00:40:45,533
Those days have gone now and
your Jalebees have come.

509
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:48,537
Here, eat. I have made them today.

510
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:51,377
No. Enough for now.
- Eat them.

511
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:56,219
You are eating after so many
days and I am giving you.

512
00:40:57,354 --> 00:40:58,480
But...

513
00:40:58,556 --> 00:41:00,285
How can I eat Jalebees of
twenty years in one day.

514
00:41:00,357 --> 00:41:04,157
No... son. These are fresh and hot.

515
00:41:05,162 --> 00:41:08,154
You won't understand. Give it to me.

516
00:41:11,368 --> 00:41:12,835
Here, have one more.

517
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:14,330
Give me one more.

518
00:41:16,373 --> 00:41:17,840
I can see anything.

519
00:41:19,376 --> 00:41:23,005
You are hiding it behind.
For sister, isn't it?

520
00:41:25,049 --> 00:41:27,176
You used to do it before too.

521
00:41:38,462 --> 00:41:39,861
So...

522
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:41,397
How were you lost in your childhood?

523
00:41:41,465 --> 00:41:43,524
I held my father's finger
and went to fair.

524
00:41:44,935 --> 00:41:46,869
I was lost there.
- What happened after that?

525
00:41:46,937 --> 00:41:49,201
What should have happened after
that? I started crying.

526
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:51,032
Okay...

527
00:41:51,375 --> 00:41:52,865
So who took you away?

528
00:41:53,077 --> 00:41:54,874
There was a sage, Ramtanarayan.

529
00:41:55,479 --> 00:41:56,878
He took me away.

530
00:41:58,215 --> 00:42:00,308
He took me bribing me 'Jalebees'.

531
00:42:00,885 --> 00:42:03,149
What happened after that?

532
00:42:03,888 --> 00:42:05,150
Ask me what didn't
happen after that.

533
00:42:05,222 --> 00:42:07,213
Whether I remember or have
I forgotten anything?

534
00:42:08,893 --> 00:42:12,488
He took me to Benaras, Kashi
and sometimes to Nashik.

535
00:42:13,163 --> 00:42:14,824
He didn't make you a sage?

536
00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:18,027
He wasn't a sage. He was a beggar.

537
00:42:18,335 --> 00:42:22,169
You know that the beggar who
has a child gets alms easily.

538
00:42:22,439 --> 00:42:25,169
Did he take you to Bombay?
- Yes.

539
00:42:25,442 --> 00:42:28,172
No... no... think like
that... actually...

540
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:33,449
I didn't like to beg.
And therefore...

541
00:42:33,517 --> 00:42:37,248
Tired, I came back home.

542
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:38,855
You knew the address to the house.

543
00:42:39,924 --> 00:42:41,323
Then why didn't you come earlier?

544
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:42,859
Where did I know the
address of my home?

545
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:45,319
I was lucky to meet
a beggar in Delhi.

546
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:47,523
He was in a bad state, worms
were lurking on his body.

547
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:49,866
I told him that he won't
be able even to die...

548
00:42:49,934 --> 00:42:52,459
...if he didn't tell who I
was and who my father was.

549
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:55,397
Then he told me about the
address to my house.

550
00:43:03,347 --> 00:43:06,214
Then you must have tolerated
a lot of sorrow.

551
00:43:06,283 --> 00:43:07,807
Don't ask me anything, Maya. I am...

552
00:43:07,885 --> 00:43:09,819
...scared of even the memories
of that time.

553
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:13,151
Promise me that you will not
ask me about those days.

554
00:43:14,992 --> 00:43:19,326
I promise you, I won't
ask you anything.

555
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:23,992
You have come home, that is enough.

556
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:36,845
Maya... Maya.

557
00:43:43,921 --> 00:43:45,183
Where is he?

558
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:46,855
Who?

559
00:43:46,924 --> 00:43:49,188
That one...
- Who?

560
00:43:49,326 --> 00:43:51,317
Please tell.
- Tell me.

561
00:43:51,395 --> 00:43:52,453
What should I tell?

562
00:43:52,529 --> 00:43:54,190
Where is your brother?

563
00:43:55,933 --> 00:43:57,867
Oh!
- Please tell quickly.

564
00:43:57,935 --> 00:44:01,200
Wait. I will see.

565
00:44:05,876 --> 00:44:07,810
Brother. Run away. Run away.
Problems have arrived.

566
00:44:07,878 --> 00:44:08,970
What happened?

567
00:44:09,046 --> 00:44:10,809
All of them are coming.
- Who are coming?

568
00:44:10,881 --> 00:44:12,405
They are coming here.
- Who?

569
00:44:12,883 --> 00:44:14,817
The girls, run away.

570
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:17,283
So what if the girls are coming?

571
00:44:18,288 --> 00:44:19,812
You don't know the girls
of the village.

572
00:44:20,891 --> 00:44:22,415
All of them are hot chillies.

573
00:44:22,893 --> 00:44:24,360
If even one of them touches you...

574
00:44:24,428 --> 00:44:25,827
...you will keep on writhing.

575
00:44:25,896 --> 00:44:29,423
There will be water in your eyes,
nose and smoke in your ears.

576
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:32,162
Oh! Go! I have seen
so many in Bombay.

577
00:44:32,369 --> 00:44:34,360
You must have seen,
but not like these.

578
00:44:36,306 --> 00:44:39,434
Nothing. I will challenge
each one of them.

579
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:42,037
Yes. You will find it out right now.

580
00:45:09,406 --> 00:45:14,400
He is simple of look at,
and good at heart.

581
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:19,406
He has come from Bombay,
a nice man.

582
00:45:43,307 --> 00:45:48,301
Every path of the village has
awakened while it was sleeping.

583
00:45:53,450 --> 00:46:00,379
It seems that we are young.

584
00:46:00,858 --> 00:46:05,386
He has brought my childhood
with him.

585
00:46:41,231 --> 00:46:46,328
Don't make him a fool.

586
00:46:51,441 --> 00:46:58,438
He is the king of maidens.
So, don't laugh at him.

587
00:46:59,049 --> 00:47:03,383
He will steal your heart,
don't joke with him.

588
00:48:07,317 --> 00:48:12,311
But listen, o King, please
don't forget it.

589
00:48:17,861 --> 00:48:20,261
This game of eyes is bad.

590
00:48:22,866 --> 00:48:25,130
It makes one crazy.

591
00:48:25,202 --> 00:48:29,468
This is the village of maidens,
save your heart.

592
00:49:31,401 --> 00:49:33,392
The son has come back.
Kundan's mother.

593
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:35,394
All our problems are over now.

594
00:49:36,873 --> 00:49:37,999
Problems?

595
00:49:38,075 --> 00:49:39,406
I tell you.

596
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:42,206
Both our life and death
have been successful.

597
00:49:43,013 --> 00:49:47,143
I thought that I would die
without seeing my son.

598
00:49:48,418 --> 00:49:50,409
And I will go to hell.

599
00:49:52,289 --> 00:49:56,282
But now I have heaven
here as well as there.

600
00:49:57,427 --> 00:50:00,988
Yes, Rukmini. We are lucky now.

601
00:50:02,099 --> 00:50:04,226
Now the son should look
after all the business.

602
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:07,360
And he should give us a holiday.

603
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:11,497
Accountant... accountant...

604
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:16,173
What do you say?

605
00:50:17,914 --> 00:50:19,438
Yes.
- Yes.

606
00:50:19,916 --> 00:50:22,384
Start telling the son all about
the business form tomorrow.

607
00:50:22,452 --> 00:50:23,851
Please don't worry.

608
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,854
I will teach him like
this, he won't...

609
00:50:25,922 --> 00:50:27,389
...know anything throughout his
life. - What are you blabbering?

610
00:50:27,457 --> 00:50:31,359
He will know everything.
- Yes...

611
00:50:46,943 --> 00:50:49,537
Hey, what are you doing hiding here?

612
00:50:52,949 --> 00:50:56,214
What's the matter? - The matter is...

613
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:03,485
Hey... you are breathing so heavily...

614
00:51:07,431 --> 00:51:09,422
What is the matter, uncle?

615
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,367
The matter is...

616
00:51:11,435 --> 00:51:12,834
When I see you... - I...

617
00:51:14,438 --> 00:51:15,837
You...

618
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:17,373
I feel unconscious.

619
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:20,172
Okay... what else happens?

620
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:22,234
Something happens here...

621
00:51:25,382 --> 00:51:26,849
You...

622
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:29,511
Are you hitting me? Wait.

623
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:39,385
What is this happening to me?

624
00:51:39,463 --> 00:51:41,397
Tell me.

625
00:51:41,465 --> 00:51:42,864
Should I tell you?

626
00:51:43,333 --> 00:51:47,201
What ambitions are
coming in my heart?

627
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:55,367
And here... here... why is something
like this happening?

628
00:51:56,146 --> 00:51:58,205
Should I tell you?
- Yes.

629
00:51:58,281 --> 00:51:59,873
On your head... on your head...

630
00:52:02,886 --> 00:52:05,150
Ghost... where is it? Whose is it?

631
00:52:05,355 --> 00:52:06,822
Does love too have a ghost?

632
00:52:07,424 --> 00:52:10,154
It's the Ghost of love. - Yes.

633
00:52:11,895 --> 00:52:13,829
Do you want it removed?

634
00:52:13,897 --> 00:52:15,023
Yes.

635
00:52:15,098 --> 00:52:16,827
Should I remove it?
Should I remove it?

636
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:17,992
Yes, you will remove it, isn't it?

637
00:52:18,068 --> 00:52:19,365
Yes. I will remove it.

638
00:52:19,436 --> 00:52:20,835
Then, it doesn't matter.

639
00:52:20,904 --> 00:52:22,030
Will you have it removed?
- Yes.

640
00:52:22,105 --> 00:52:23,299
Should I remove it?
- Yes.

641
00:52:23,373 --> 00:52:24,840
Should I remove it?
- Yes.

642
00:52:40,924 --> 00:52:43,358
Mr. Kundan... Mr. Kundan...

643
00:52:43,927 --> 00:52:45,189
What is the matter?

644
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:48,192
What is the matter?

645
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:53,128
What happened?

646
00:52:53,203 --> 00:52:55,535
Actually... I have fallen in love.

647
00:52:56,273 --> 00:52:58,400
You have fallen in love? With whom?

648
00:52:58,475 --> 00:52:59,874
With a girl.

649
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:02,275
It is good that you didn't fall
in love with an old woman.

650
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:04,404
Yes, but the matter is,
I don't know how to love.

651
00:53:04,481 --> 00:53:06,813
I am forty years old. If
I die without loving...

652
00:53:06,883 --> 00:53:08,009
...what will happen of my children?

653
00:53:08,084 --> 00:53:09,210
Totally illiterate.

654
00:53:09,286 --> 00:53:11,811
Sir... a man falls in love
first, then he marries.

655
00:53:11,888 --> 00:53:13,355
And children are born after that.

656
00:53:13,423 --> 00:53:15,220
Oh yes! But I don't know all this.

657
00:53:15,292 --> 00:53:17,351
I am very scared of women. I
don't understand anything.

658
00:53:17,427 --> 00:53:19,156
Do you think that they
are some puzzle?

659
00:53:19,229 --> 00:53:20,355
The women are just like us.

660
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:21,829
Women are just like
the two of us are.

661
00:53:21,898 --> 00:53:23,160
It is very easy to fall
in love with a woman.

662
00:53:23,233 --> 00:53:24,359
Is it very simple?
- Yes.

663
00:53:24,434 --> 00:53:26,493
Okay tell me how to do it.
I will just love and come.

664
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:29,838
Who is it?

665
00:53:29,906 --> 00:53:31,237
I won't tell you that.

666
00:53:31,308 --> 00:53:32,832
I got a chance after forty years.

667
00:53:32,909 --> 00:53:34,843
You city slickers
are very dangerous.

668
00:53:34,911 --> 00:53:36,310
Okay, please listen to me.

669
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:38,506
One goes to her first and smiles.

670
00:53:39,249 --> 00:53:40,375
How does one smile.

671
00:53:40,450 --> 00:53:41,849
Show me your teeth.

672
00:53:42,452 --> 00:53:46,013
After that, one praises what
one likes about her. - Is it?

673
00:53:46,456 --> 00:53:47,855
For example...

674
00:53:47,924 --> 00:53:49,050
What do you like about her?

675
00:53:49,125 --> 00:53:50,251
I like everything.

676
00:53:50,327 --> 00:53:55,526
I mean... do you like her eyes, her
talks, her lips or her hair.

677
00:53:56,933 --> 00:54:00,130
If you describe her identity to me
then I'll make you the boss. - Really!?

678
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:02,132
Go and tell her.

679
00:54:02,339 --> 00:54:05,399
Your black eyes. Your fair cheeks...

680
00:54:05,875 --> 00:54:08,139
Your intoxicating lips,
your black hair...

681
00:54:08,211 --> 00:54:10,202
I sacrifice myself to you.

682
00:54:11,281 --> 00:54:12,407
Go.

683
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:15,407
One has to smile first.

684
00:54:26,363 --> 00:54:27,830
I have just one chance in life...

685
00:54:27,897 --> 00:54:29,159
What is your father's loss?

686
00:54:29,232 --> 00:54:30,824
Silent.

687
00:54:32,435 --> 00:54:34,232
Your white hair.

688
00:54:35,305 --> 00:54:36,829
Your red eyes.

689
00:54:37,507 --> 00:54:39,168
Your black lips.

690
00:54:39,509 --> 00:54:40,840
Your long teeth.

691
00:54:42,045 --> 00:54:43,842
I sacrifice myself on you.

692
00:54:43,913 --> 00:54:45,005
What?

693
00:54:45,248 --> 00:54:46,840
I am praising you.

694
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:50,451
Are you praising me? Or are
you missing some witch?

695
00:54:51,388 --> 00:54:53,447
Did I make some mistake?
I will come right away.

696
00:54:53,523 --> 00:54:54,854
Get lost from here.

697
00:54:56,459 --> 00:54:57,858
No...

698
00:54:57,927 --> 00:54:59,451
This is not my work, uncle.

699
00:54:59,529 --> 00:55:01,121
This is not your work?

700
00:55:01,197 --> 00:55:03,392
The whole world writes it's
accounts in Devnagari.

701
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:05,263
Your Urdu won't work here.

702
00:55:05,335 --> 00:55:07,394
There is some Matra (vowel)
In Devnagari (lndian language).

703
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:09,131
There is nothing in this language.

704
00:55:09,205 --> 00:55:10,331
You are right.

705
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:13,135
But you should try at least.

706
00:55:13,209 --> 00:55:15,200
How will you know everything
without trying?

707
00:55:15,278 --> 00:55:16,802
Come on, I will teach you.

708
00:55:18,014 --> 00:55:19,140
Okay, uncle.

709
00:55:21,217 --> 00:55:23,208
Kutta (dog)! Bedin (faithless)!

710
00:55:25,889 --> 00:55:28,357
What is this?
- Do we write abuses in accounts?

711
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:30,152
What else is this?

712
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:31,486
Kutbuddin.

713
00:55:31,895 --> 00:55:33,419
Kutbuddin is written?
- Yes.

714
00:55:33,897 --> 00:55:37,162
Kutbuddin... Kutbuddin... is dead?

715
00:55:37,901 --> 00:55:39,835
Oh God...

716
00:55:39,903 --> 00:55:41,427
It is taken away.

717
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:44,496
Kutbuddin took away five
hundred and fifty rupees.

718
00:55:44,908 --> 00:55:46,307
What business is this?

719
00:55:46,376 --> 00:55:48,503
All this goes on in business. See.

720
00:55:48,912 --> 00:55:50,846
Five hundred and fifty rupees
is written properly, isn't it?

721
00:55:50,914 --> 00:55:52,313
Yes. It is written.

722
00:55:52,382 --> 00:55:54,509
This is DUI. There is
one line against it.

723
00:55:54,918 --> 00:55:56,442
It is twenty five paise.

724
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:58,387
If there are two lines,
it is fifty paise.

725
00:55:58,455 --> 00:55:59,854
And five lines are one rupee
and twenty five paise?

726
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:05,121
I won't learn this.

727
00:56:05,261 --> 00:56:07,252
Even your father will have
to learn this. - Yes.

728
00:56:07,397 --> 00:56:10,389
A man doesn't learn everything
in the womb.

729
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,331
Even I had learnt it.

730
00:56:12,402 --> 00:56:15,394
But I am not interested
in these studies.

731
00:56:17,273 --> 00:56:20,401
What are you interested in?
Even I should know.

732
00:56:21,478 --> 00:56:23,810
I am seeing your face
for a month now.

733
00:56:24,481 --> 00:56:27,143
I am here today, I
am not here today.

734
00:56:27,417 --> 00:56:30,284
There is such a huge wealth
and vast property.

735
00:56:30,353 --> 00:56:32,480
Who will look after all this?
- Who will look?

736
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:35,016
This uncle is already waiting
with his mouth agape.

737
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:38,023
When my eyes will close and
he takes all the money.

738
00:56:38,094 --> 00:56:39,288
What are you saying, Shahji?

739
00:56:39,362 --> 00:56:42,160
Shut up, uncle. I know everything.

740
00:56:42,432 --> 00:56:46,425
I want you to take care of
everything while I am alive.

741
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:49,361
Or else, this wolf will
take all this wealth.

742
00:56:49,439 --> 00:56:52,374
Yes, a man does become greedy.

743
00:56:52,442 --> 00:56:55,172
Do you hear that?
- Yes.

744
00:56:59,849 --> 00:57:01,783
Where are you going on in a huff?

745
00:57:02,118 --> 00:57:03,312
Nowhere.

746
00:57:03,386 --> 00:57:04,785
Nowhere?

747
00:57:05,388 --> 00:57:08,186
If you don't have to go anywhere,
come with me.

748
00:57:11,394 --> 00:57:13,191
Do you like all this?

749
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:15,322
It seems that I have been
playing here in childhood.

750
00:57:15,398 --> 00:57:18,390
See that...
- Listen, can I tell you something?

751
00:57:18,868 --> 00:57:20,859
You won't feel bad?

752
00:57:21,337 --> 00:57:23,328
You shouldn't have talked
to father like this.

753
00:57:23,406 --> 00:57:25,135
What did I tell father? He
came and started shouting.

754
00:57:25,208 --> 00:57:27,802
You don't know father.
However strict...

755
00:57:27,877 --> 00:57:30,141
...he is from outside,
he is that soft inside.

756
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:32,006
Listen...

757
00:57:32,081 --> 00:57:35,278
All he wants is his son to look
after all the business.

758
00:57:35,351 --> 00:57:37,478
But how can I look after all
the business in one day?

759
00:57:37,887 --> 00:57:39,821
But you can at least show
him. You can learn too.

760
00:57:39,889 --> 00:57:42,483
You can try too. - Where will
I be living here for so long?

761
00:57:43,426 --> 00:57:44,825
What do you mean?

762
00:57:48,498 --> 00:57:49,829
I mean...

763
00:57:49,899 --> 00:57:52,367
I mean... I am not accustomed
to live in the village.

764
00:57:52,435 --> 00:57:54,494
I was born and brought
up in the city.

765
00:57:54,904 --> 00:57:58,431
Everything in this city
seems new to me.

766
00:58:01,845 --> 00:58:03,972
You don't like anything here?

767
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:08,111
These fields, trees, air, clouds...

768
00:58:10,854 --> 00:58:12,116
Me...

769
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:19,328
This... All this that you can see.

770
00:58:19,395 --> 00:58:21,329
All this is yours.

771
00:58:21,865 --> 00:58:25,392
These fields are yours.
This land is yours.

772
00:58:25,869 --> 00:58:28,394
That... that house.
That is yours too.

773
00:58:28,872 --> 00:58:32,308
And you? - And I... am yours and
you are mine too.

774
00:58:33,276 --> 00:58:34,800
Come on, will you see more?

775
00:58:41,284 --> 00:58:43,275
What are you doing
just sitting here?

776
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:44,820
Pluck some flowers!

777
00:58:44,888 --> 00:58:46,412
Salute first.

778
00:58:46,890 --> 00:58:48,152
Salute first!

779
00:59:45,148 --> 00:59:47,480
Okay. Come on. I salute you.

780
00:59:47,884 --> 00:59:51,320
Salute me again. Better.

781
01:00:28,057 --> 01:00:29,854
What did you do?

782
01:00:30,393 --> 01:00:31,519
Why?

783
01:00:33,529 --> 01:00:36,464
Flower... you set it in my hair?

784
01:00:37,934 --> 01:00:39,367
What wrong did I do?

785
01:00:40,536 --> 01:00:41,867
You are very simple.

786
01:00:41,938 --> 01:00:44,202
Unmarried women don't put
flowers in their hair.

787
01:00:44,941 --> 01:00:46,465
All the girls in Bombay put it.

788
01:00:46,943 --> 01:00:48,877
Once again, you are talking
about the same thing.

789
01:00:48,945 --> 01:00:50,936
There must be such a custom
in Bombay, not here.

790
01:00:54,217 --> 01:00:56,549
The flower increases the
beauty of a woman.

791
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:01,980
There is a lot of difference
between women and sisters.

792
01:01:03,893 --> 01:01:05,155
Is a sister not a woman?

793
01:01:05,895 --> 01:01:07,226
See, this flower.

794
01:01:18,908 --> 01:01:20,170
What kind of noise is this?

795
01:01:29,185 --> 01:01:30,379
It is sparrows here.

796
01:01:30,453 --> 01:01:31,852
The sparrows?

797
01:01:31,921 --> 01:01:33,013
Yes.

798
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:35,991
The sparrows here are very special.

799
01:01:36,059 --> 01:01:37,856
They come here in a special season.

800
01:01:42,932 --> 01:01:44,194
Did you listen to the voice?

801
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:52,872
These are birds?

802
01:01:53,209 --> 01:01:54,403
Yes. This is a bird too.

803
01:01:54,477 --> 01:01:55,876
A bird?

804
01:01:56,479 --> 01:01:57,878
There are many.

805
01:02:00,349 --> 01:02:01,816
And it has worn anklets too?

806
01:02:03,886 --> 01:02:05,012
You don't know it.

807
01:02:05,088 --> 01:02:08,421
The sparrows here
dance and sing too.

808
01:02:10,293 --> 01:02:12,352
They sing and dance too! Come on!

809
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:27,499
When we walk, there is
a wave in the sea.

810
01:02:32,381 --> 01:02:36,511
When we walk, there is
a wave in the sea.

811
01:02:41,457 --> 01:02:49,330
What kind of wave is there
in the mind, tell me.

812
01:03:10,887 --> 01:03:15,415
Someone's attitude makes
a wave in my mind.

813
01:03:19,896 --> 01:03:24,424
There is lightning in the heart,
due to someone's poison.

814
01:03:29,172 --> 01:03:30,833
How do I tell you how there was...

815
01:03:30,907 --> 01:03:32,966
...lightning without any clouds.

816
01:03:33,042 --> 01:03:36,500
How will there be lightning?

817
01:03:57,934 --> 01:04:02,462
The lightning is created due
to the gait of the maidens.

818
01:04:07,410 --> 01:04:12,313
There is thunder due to the
music of the anklets.

819
01:04:17,019 --> 01:04:18,816
But even then they ask you...

820
01:04:18,888 --> 01:04:24,952
How did the anklets have
a rhythm? Tell me!

821
01:04:46,382 --> 01:04:51,183
The rhythm of the anklets falls
on the heart and mind.

822
01:04:55,925 --> 01:05:00,259
Someone sees someone.

823
01:05:04,867 --> 01:05:08,803
What will happen once
one sees someone.

824
01:05:08,871 --> 01:05:12,807
Nothing can be said, you
say something, girl.

825
01:05:12,875 --> 01:05:16,402
Nothing can be said,
fearing the world.

826
01:05:33,896 --> 01:05:38,492
I'm unable to talk about it
as I dread the world.

827
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:47,442
If you can hear, hear it
from someone's gaze.

828
01:05:52,181 --> 01:05:56,174
Even then, they ask you.

829
01:05:56,252 --> 01:05:59,949
Did you understand, tell me!

830
01:07:14,397 --> 01:07:17,389
Sir... please come with me.

831
01:07:18,868 --> 01:07:20,859
You go. I will come.

832
01:07:24,273 --> 01:07:25,399
What do you want?

833
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:28,469
Why are you angry? Did
I ruin your game?

834
01:07:29,412 --> 01:07:30,811
What are you saying?

835
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,006
See, Babu.

836
01:07:32,081 --> 01:07:35,346
It is about a month now.
And you are still there.

837
01:07:35,418 --> 01:07:38,148
You are forgetting your objective.

838
01:07:38,354 --> 01:07:44,020
Am I not doing my job?

839
01:07:44,093 --> 01:07:47,358
I didn't send you there for such
small ten twenty rupees amount.

840
01:07:47,430 --> 01:07:49,159
I sent you there for
a very big amount.

841
01:07:49,432 --> 01:07:51,832
Then what has stopped
you from your work?

842
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:53,163
It isn't anything.

843
01:07:53,436 --> 01:07:55,495
Such things need patience.
- Don't lie.

844
01:07:56,505 --> 01:07:58,837
I know that you're being
swayed by that girl.

845
01:07:58,908 --> 01:08:00,375
Don't talk like this.

846
01:08:00,843 --> 01:08:02,777
Then what should I talk about?

847
01:08:03,379 --> 01:08:04,778
See, Babu.

848
01:08:04,847 --> 01:08:09,443
You can fool that silly old fellow
with these words.

849
01:08:10,853 --> 01:08:11,979
But you cannot fool Bhagat.

850
01:08:12,054 --> 01:08:14,113
It is nothing like that,
Bhagatji... you have...

851
01:08:14,190 --> 01:08:16,124
You have misunderstood me.

852
01:08:16,192 --> 01:08:17,318
Misunderstood you.

853
01:08:17,393 --> 01:08:19,122
Bhagat doesn't misunderstand anyone.

854
01:08:19,862 --> 01:08:22,330
Anyway... do whatever you want to.

855
01:08:22,398 --> 01:08:24,389
But don't forget my work.

856
01:08:24,867 --> 01:08:27,461
Or else, I will have to tell my
heart felt to someone else.

857
01:08:27,970 --> 01:08:29,130
To the police...

858
01:08:29,205 --> 01:08:30,797
Yes... Bhagatji... everything
will be all right.

859
01:08:30,873 --> 01:08:34,138
You just give me some ten twelve
or fifteen days more.

860
01:08:34,210 --> 01:08:35,336
Promise?

861
01:08:35,411 --> 01:08:36,810
Everything will be all right.

862
01:08:53,429 --> 01:08:55,488
Is it your father's house
that you are entering?

863
01:08:56,298 --> 01:08:58,823
It is not my father's,
it is your father's.

864
01:08:58,901 --> 01:09:00,368
And your Maya.

865
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:02,096
Tell me.

866
01:09:02,171 --> 01:09:04,162
Did you come out of
that Maya's trap?

867
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:07,107
Didn't I tell you that I
am not interested in her?

868
01:09:07,176 --> 01:09:09,440
So what if you are not,
I am interested in her.

869
01:09:09,979 --> 01:09:11,173
What are you saying?

870
01:09:11,247 --> 01:09:13,442
Not in that Maya, but in material.

871
01:09:14,316 --> 01:09:18,446
Babu... I want 200 rupees.
And right now.

872
01:09:20,122 --> 01:09:22,113
You come riding a horse
whenever you come.

873
01:09:22,458 --> 01:09:24,449
I cannot arrange for two
hundred rupees right now.

874
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:28,327
I can give you ten rupees now.

875
01:09:28,864 --> 01:09:31,128
A person from Bombay
and just ten rupees...

876
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:32,394
Why are you creating a ruckus?

877
01:09:32,968 --> 01:09:34,799
See. I didn't make you the son...

878
01:09:34,870 --> 01:09:37,134
...of such a rich father,
so that you...

879
01:09:37,206 --> 01:09:39,470
...forget me when you are having fun.

880
01:09:39,975 --> 01:09:41,340
Arrange for two hundred rupees...

881
01:09:41,410 --> 01:09:44,140
Okay. Go. It will be arranged
for tomorrow.

882
01:09:46,348 --> 01:09:47,815
Don't forget.

883
01:10:09,905 --> 01:10:11,167
Uncle...

884
01:10:11,907 --> 01:10:13,431
I need two hundred rupees.

885
01:10:17,513 --> 01:10:18,844
Shahji...

886
01:10:18,914 --> 01:10:20,381
What are you staring at my face?

887
01:10:20,449 --> 01:10:22,440
Ask him why he needs 200 rupees?

888
01:10:23,919 --> 01:10:25,250
Why do you want 200 rupees?

889
01:10:25,321 --> 01:10:27,312
Say that I want it as pocket money.

890
01:10:27,923 --> 01:10:29,390
He wants it as pocket money.

891
01:10:29,458 --> 01:10:30,857
Pocket money?

892
01:10:31,927 --> 01:10:33,918
What rubbish is this pocket money?

893
01:10:34,196 --> 01:10:35,390
I am not saying anything rubbish.

894
01:10:35,464 --> 01:10:37,398
He says that he didn't
speak rubbish.

895
01:10:37,466 --> 01:10:40,264
You are the one who
is speaking rubbish.

896
01:10:41,270 --> 01:10:43,534
You... you are saying this?

897
01:10:44,073 --> 01:10:45,199
Food, clothes...

898
01:10:45,274 --> 01:10:47,538
What need of yours isn't
fulfilled in this house?

899
01:10:48,043 --> 01:10:50,204
In fact, Ramda brings
cigarettes for you too.

900
01:10:50,279 --> 01:10:52,270
Not just a couple, but whole tins.

901
01:10:52,881 --> 01:10:54,405
You get whatever comes
from the city.

902
01:10:54,483 --> 01:10:55,882
And I get the bills.

903
01:10:56,418 --> 01:10:57,885
Why do you need these
two hundred rupees?

904
01:10:57,953 --> 01:10:59,420
I want it for charity.

905
01:10:59,488 --> 01:11:01,479
Charity has been going on
in our house forever.

906
01:11:01,890 --> 01:11:03,824
Ask this accountant.

907
01:11:04,893 --> 01:11:10,160
Since the last twenty years, what
have I not given in your name?

908
01:11:10,899 --> 01:11:13,163
Then?
- Why do you want to give?

909
01:11:13,235 --> 01:11:15,226
Wherever I want to give,
how you related?

910
01:11:15,437 --> 01:11:18,235
Do I not have a right on this house?

911
01:11:18,307 --> 01:11:20,366
I am alive as yet. I didn't die.

912
01:11:20,442 --> 01:11:23,309
When I die, lose this whole
wealth if you want.

913
01:11:23,379 --> 01:11:24,846
Set it afire throwing it out.

914
01:11:32,021 --> 01:11:36,185
Kundan... Kundna... come here.

915
01:11:41,063 --> 01:11:43,190
Sit son. Sit.

916
01:11:56,278 --> 01:11:57,370
Here.

917
01:11:57,479 --> 01:11:58,878
Open it.

918
01:11:58,947 --> 01:12:01,142
Take how much ever money
you want from this.

919
01:12:02,885 --> 01:12:05,149
Don't take your father's
anger on your mother.

920
01:12:05,220 --> 01:12:06,812
All this is your money.

921
01:12:15,497 --> 01:12:18,364
If you dirty your mind, I will die.

922
01:12:19,435 --> 01:12:23,428
Don't fight with your father
for this dirt of the hands.

923
01:12:24,373 --> 01:12:26,364
Take whatever you want from it.

924
01:12:27,242 --> 01:12:28,334
No...

925
01:12:29,912 --> 01:12:31,846
I don't want anything from it.

926
01:12:31,914 --> 01:12:34,178
Son. You don't know him.

927
01:12:34,917 --> 01:12:36,851
However he may be from outside.

928
01:12:36,919 --> 01:12:38,853
He is very soft from inside.

929
01:12:39,388 --> 01:12:41,515
He cannot even see anything
bad happening to an enemy.

930
01:12:42,458 --> 01:12:44,449
And then... you are our son.

931
01:12:44,526 --> 01:12:49,190
Yes. I know. I know.

932
01:13:29,505 --> 01:13:33,373
Son... please forgive this
old man's madness.

933
01:13:58,267 --> 01:13:59,393
Come.

934
01:13:59,468 --> 01:14:00,799
He is our man.

935
01:14:00,869 --> 01:14:03,133
Here is the money. A
whole two hundred.

936
01:14:04,473 --> 01:14:05,804
Very good.

937
01:14:05,874 --> 01:14:07,341
Now when will you do the real task?

938
01:14:07,409 --> 01:14:10,139
It will be done. That
will be done too.

939
01:14:10,879 --> 01:14:12,005
But when?

940
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:14,344
These hundred two hundred
rupees don't work.

941
01:14:14,416 --> 01:14:16,407
Do that work which will
drive away all problems.

942
01:14:16,485 --> 01:14:17,816
Didn't I tell you that
I won't go away...

943
01:14:17,886 --> 01:14:19,353
...from there till the time the
objective isn't completed?

944
01:14:19,421 --> 01:14:22,151
Which objective?
- Hold your tongue.

945
01:14:22,424 --> 01:14:24,483
Babu... a lot of heat is not good.

946
01:14:24,893 --> 01:14:26,155
Sit down, Babu.

947
01:14:26,228 --> 01:14:27,820
Hey, give a BIDI to Babu.

948
01:14:36,505 --> 01:14:38,496
It isn't anything to get angry.

949
01:14:39,374 --> 01:14:40,841
I was reminding you.

950
01:14:41,910 --> 01:14:44,504
The parents that I gave
you, they are fake.

951
01:14:45,380 --> 01:14:46,847
Don't fall in their
love and all and...

952
01:14:46,915 --> 01:14:49,383
...forget the real matter.

953
01:14:49,451 --> 01:14:50,850
Till the time I don't get
the keys of the safe...

954
01:14:50,919 --> 01:14:54,320
...it is difficult to do this work.
- What is so difficult in that?

955
01:14:54,389 --> 01:14:55,856
The keys to safe are below the old...

956
01:14:55,924 --> 01:14:58,518
...man's pillow for all
the twenty four hours.

957
01:14:59,061 --> 01:15:02,462
Kill him on some night
and steal everything.

958
01:15:03,198 --> 01:15:04,392
Give me my share.

959
01:15:04,466 --> 01:15:06,127
And then do whatever you want to.

960
01:15:07,870 --> 01:15:10,202
This is a NC offence. I cannot
do anything in this.

961
01:15:11,406 --> 01:15:12,805
Yes?

962
01:15:12,875 --> 01:15:15,139
Good news, sir. Babu's
whereabouts are known.

963
01:15:15,210 --> 01:15:16,336
Babu's whereabouts are known?

964
01:15:16,411 --> 01:15:18,470
Yes. He was seen at
the Delhi station.

965
01:15:22,317 --> 01:15:23,409
Who saw him?

966
01:15:23,485 --> 01:15:24,816
Some TT saw him.

967
01:15:27,322 --> 01:15:28,812
You must have found
his name and address?

968
01:15:28,891 --> 01:15:30,882
Yes. This is the full report.

969
01:16:13,869 --> 01:16:18,329
Crazy... and wild... God knows
where the heart became such.

970
01:16:18,407 --> 01:16:23,344
When this spring arrived.

971
01:16:46,902 --> 01:16:51,362
The black clouds touch my body...

972
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:55,843
Every crazy wave flirts with me.

973
01:17:10,459 --> 01:17:14,793
It is some unknown path.

974
01:17:43,158 --> 01:17:47,822
Something unsaid is
said by my soul.

975
01:17:47,896 --> 01:17:52,424
My life says and my
heartbeat sings.

976
01:18:07,115 --> 01:18:11,313
A new fable.

977
01:19:12,247 --> 01:19:16,775
The monsoon has started,
the clouds have danced.

978
01:19:16,852 --> 01:19:21,380
Whoever we see has become mad.

979
01:19:31,399 --> 01:19:35,392
Who has become crazy?

980
01:20:42,204 --> 01:20:44,536
Take the photograph quickly.
My hands are tired.

981
01:20:48,476 --> 01:20:49,875
Come closer.

982
01:20:52,214 --> 01:20:53,374
Closer.

983
01:20:54,216 --> 01:20:55,376
Come on.

984
01:20:55,483 --> 01:20:56,882
Closer.

985
01:21:01,489 --> 01:21:03,480
You look so beautiful.

986
01:21:16,371 --> 01:21:17,838
I love you too.

987
01:21:17,906 --> 01:21:19,032
Brother...

988
01:21:19,107 --> 01:21:20,836
Don't call me with that name.

989
01:21:20,909 --> 01:21:22,376
What are you saying?

990
01:21:22,911 --> 01:21:24,378
I am telling you the truth.

991
01:21:24,446 --> 01:21:25,845
I can tell lies to the whole world.

992
01:21:25,914 --> 01:21:29,509
But I cannot lie to you. Maya,
I am not your brother.

993
01:21:30,919 --> 01:21:33,513
You aren't my brother?

994
01:21:34,189 --> 01:21:36,521
I am telling you the truth.
I am not your brother.

995
01:21:36,925 --> 01:21:42,261
I am nothing. I am a
thief and a killer.

996
01:21:43,465 --> 01:21:45,524
And the police is chasing me.

997
01:21:55,410 --> 01:21:57,537
No. All this is lies.

998
01:21:57,946 --> 01:21:59,208
This is truth.

999
01:22:00,148 --> 01:22:02,480
Your love can turn a thief
like me into a man again.

1000
01:22:02,884 --> 01:22:04,818
You will have to give me this love.

1001
01:22:07,322 --> 01:22:10,018
When did I tell you that
I won't give you love?

1002
01:22:12,894 --> 01:22:15,829
But not like this... I am just...

1003
01:22:15,897 --> 01:22:18,491
No. I don't want a sister's love.
I want a woman's love.

1004
01:22:31,046 --> 01:22:32,240
Maya...

1005
01:22:32,447 --> 01:22:33,846
Don't go, Maya.

1006
01:22:34,916 --> 01:22:36,042
Don't go, Maya...

1007
01:22:36,117 --> 01:22:37,448
Maya... Maya...

1008
01:22:40,522 --> 01:22:41,853
What happened?

1009
01:22:41,923 --> 01:22:43,185
What happened, brother?

1010
01:22:43,258 --> 01:22:48,252
Don't go, Maya. Don't go. Don't go.

1011
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:53,526
What happened?

1012
01:22:54,936 --> 01:22:56,062
What happened?

1013
01:22:56,471 --> 01:22:57,870
You were shouting.

1014
01:22:58,406 --> 01:23:00,340
I was shouting?
- In your sleep.

1015
01:23:05,146 --> 01:23:07,478
I feel like molten lead
has been poured into my ears.

1016
01:23:09,417 --> 01:23:10,816
What else should I call
you if not brother?

1017
01:23:10,885 --> 01:23:12,819
I hate this name.

1018
01:23:13,421 --> 01:23:16,481
Hate? Why?

1019
01:23:17,025 --> 01:23:20,984
You don't know, Maya.
Because... because...

1020
01:23:22,330 --> 01:23:23,422
Okay.

1021
01:23:24,165 --> 01:23:25,826
So from today, I won't
call you brother.

1022
01:23:25,900 --> 01:23:27,367
I will call you Bhaiji...

1023
01:23:27,435 --> 01:23:29,494
No... not Bhaiji.

1024
01:23:30,171 --> 01:23:32,162
If you want to call me,
call me Kundan or Babu.

1025
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:38,236
Just like my loved ones tell
me. Everyone calls me.

1026
01:23:38,313 --> 01:23:39,837
I am younger than you, you isn't it?

1027
01:23:39,914 --> 01:23:41,381
How can I call you with your name?

1028
01:23:41,449 --> 01:23:43,314
Even though you are so educated...

1029
01:23:43,385 --> 01:23:47,253
...you speak like this? I permit you.

1030
01:23:48,923 --> 01:23:51,517
It isn't only about you and
me. There are others too.

1031
01:23:54,396 --> 01:23:56,387
Let the others go to hell.

1032
01:24:05,874 --> 01:24:07,136
Twenty years...

1033
01:24:08,009 --> 01:24:11,968
Forget wearing these jewels,
I didn't even touch them.

1034
01:24:13,348 --> 01:24:14,815
And what will I wear now?

1035
01:24:16,151 --> 01:24:18,142
I will give all this to
my daughter-in-law.

1036
01:24:18,219 --> 01:24:19,345
Daughter-in-law?

1037
01:24:19,421 --> 01:24:21,480
Yes. You act so simple.

1038
01:24:22,157 --> 01:24:24,216
As if you don't know what
a daughter-in-law is.

1039
01:24:24,292 --> 01:24:25,816
Forget all these useless things.

1040
01:24:27,429 --> 01:24:29,420
You think all this is useless?

1041
01:24:31,232 --> 01:24:32,824
What do you know?

1042
01:24:33,234 --> 01:24:34,826
In some corner of the
heart of every mother...

1043
01:24:34,903 --> 01:24:37,497
...there is some daughter-in-law
hiding...

1044
01:24:38,907 --> 01:24:45,506
Who comes one day wearing
bangles and anklets.

1045
01:24:48,450 --> 01:24:50,441
Look at the necklace of
your daughter-in-law.

1046
01:24:55,457 --> 01:24:57,516
This necklace seems
to be very expensive.

1047
01:24:58,259 --> 01:25:00,454
Yes, you don't know.

1048
01:25:01,463 --> 01:25:03,795
This necklace has been in our
family since four generations.

1049
01:25:03,865 --> 01:25:06,390
From the mother-in-law
to the daughter-in-law.

1050
01:25:06,868 --> 01:25:08,802
And now...

1051
01:25:09,204 --> 01:25:11,399
Now I will make my daughter-in-law
wear it.

1052
01:25:11,873 --> 01:25:13,135
Let me see.

1053
01:25:14,876 --> 01:25:16,343
I knew it.

1054
01:25:16,478 --> 01:25:18,810
Whether you search for a
daughter-in-law or not.

1055
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:21,144
You will certainly search a
daughter-in-law for the necklace.

1056
01:25:21,216 --> 01:25:24,014
I will come right away.
- Where are you going, Kundan?

1057
01:25:24,419 --> 01:25:26,410
To search for a daughter-in-law
for this necklace.

1058
01:25:26,488 --> 01:25:27,819
Crazy boy.

1059
01:25:45,340 --> 01:25:46,432
Maya...

1060
01:25:49,444 --> 01:25:50,843
Did you see this necklace?

1061
01:25:51,913 --> 01:25:54,245
It looks so beautiful and shines so.

1062
01:25:56,451 --> 01:25:59,943
But it's real beauty comes out
when it is on someone's neck.

1063
01:26:01,856 --> 01:26:03,118
Let me see...

1064
01:26:03,391 --> 01:26:07,452
Does it increase your beauty or
do you make it more sparkling.

1065
01:26:09,397 --> 01:26:11,388
It isn't for me to wear it.

1066
01:26:13,968 --> 01:26:17,404
The dignity of the
house will wear it.

1067
01:26:19,307 --> 01:26:20,797
The owner of this
house will wear it.

1068
01:26:21,142 --> 01:26:23,474
Are you not a owner of this house?

1069
01:26:27,415 --> 01:26:30,009
You are the would be
owner of this house.

1070
01:26:30,418 --> 01:26:31,817
And the mistress...

1071
01:26:32,987 --> 01:26:34,147
Will be the one who will be coming.

1072
01:26:36,291 --> 01:26:40,990
I am an outsider.

1073
01:26:41,329 --> 01:26:43,354
You are not an outsider,
I am a outsider.

1074
01:26:43,898 --> 01:26:45,832
I mean that...
- What are you saying?

1075
01:26:48,903 --> 01:26:51,167
This... this... is yours.

1076
01:26:52,440 --> 01:26:53,839
This will be worn by
your would be wife.

1077
01:26:53,908 --> 01:26:55,170
Therefore...

1078
01:26:56,911 --> 01:26:59,436
Seeing it on your neck, I will
see how it looks on a neck.

1079
01:26:59,514 --> 01:27:00,776
Don't act crazily.

1080
01:27:01,249 --> 01:27:03,240
Try to understand what I am saying.

1081
01:27:03,318 --> 01:27:05,309
I can understand. But you cannot.

1082
01:27:07,855 --> 01:27:09,789
I meant to say that...

1083
01:27:10,191 --> 01:27:12,318
Instead of this beautiful necklace...

1084
01:27:12,393 --> 01:27:15,123
...just waiting for that moment,
why don't you wear it?

1085
01:27:17,465 --> 01:27:19,456
What has happened to you?

1086
01:27:20,468 --> 01:27:21,799
Why are you being so adamant?

1087
01:27:23,404 --> 01:27:24,803
You are the one who is adamant.

1088
01:27:24,872 --> 01:27:26,806
You're exaggerating
such a minute issue?

1089
01:27:27,141 --> 01:27:28,335
Here is your necklace.

1090
01:27:56,437 --> 01:27:57,836
Mother...

1091
01:27:57,905 --> 01:27:59,167
Maya...

1092
01:28:01,109 --> 01:28:03,100
I want to ask you something.

1093
01:28:03,378 --> 01:28:04,777
Tell me.

1094
01:28:09,851 --> 01:28:13,787
Mother... when brother was young...

1095
01:28:15,323 --> 01:28:18,451
...how did he get lost?
- What do you mean?

1096
01:28:20,862 --> 01:28:22,796
Why are you asking all this?

1097
01:28:24,866 --> 01:28:26,128
Just like that...

1098
01:28:26,334 --> 01:28:27,801
When he speaks...

1099
01:28:29,871 --> 01:28:33,204
I... feel... a bit strange.

1100
01:28:33,975 --> 01:28:36,466
Crazy girl, you will feel strange.

1101
01:28:37,879 --> 01:28:40,814
The person who has stayed
away for twenty years...

1102
01:28:40,882 --> 01:28:43,817
...what does he know what
a mother's love is...

1103
01:28:43,885 --> 01:28:45,318
...and what a sister's love is... why?

1104
01:28:45,486 --> 01:28:48,148
What did my son say?

1105
01:28:51,826 --> 01:28:54,488
No, mother. It isn't
anything like that.

1106
01:28:56,431 --> 01:28:59,491
But I cannot understand anything.

1107
01:29:02,370 --> 01:29:05,931
Son. I am going to Laxmipur
to fix Maya's marriage.

1108
01:29:06,307 --> 01:29:08,298
You take care of the house
when I am not here.

1109
01:29:08,843 --> 01:29:10,310
Maya's marriage?

1110
01:29:10,378 --> 01:29:12,437
Yes, there is a Chowdhary's son.

1111
01:29:13,114 --> 01:29:15,446
He is a good boy, he has some land.

1112
01:29:15,850 --> 01:29:17,112
He earns in thousands.

1113
01:29:17,385 --> 01:29:19,444
And then Maya has studied
and matured up.

1114
01:29:19,854 --> 01:29:22,118
She has to be bid farewell now.

1115
01:29:22,390 --> 01:29:26,121
Bid farewell... what is the hurry?

1116
01:29:28,396 --> 01:29:32,196
Son... we can't keep a daughter
in the house for long too.

1117
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:34,334
But it cannot be thrown away too.

1118
01:29:34,402 --> 01:29:35,801
What do you mean?

1119
01:29:36,137 --> 01:29:37,399
I mean...

1120
01:29:38,139 --> 01:29:39,800
A man whom Maya hasn't even seen...

1121
01:29:39,874 --> 01:29:43,469
...how can you marry her off to him?

1122
01:29:44,011 --> 01:29:45,410
I asked you a suggestion.

1123
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:47,471
I didn't ask you to meddle
in my decision.

1124
01:29:47,882 --> 01:29:50,817
Your decision... is all right.
Maya is your daughter.

1125
01:29:50,885 --> 01:29:53,979
But Maya is something of mine too.

1126
01:29:54,889 --> 01:29:56,015
You...

1127
01:29:56,090 --> 01:29:57,148
You should have some
problems when the...

1128
01:29:57,225 --> 01:29:59,159
...boy is not good and
the house is not good.

1129
01:29:59,227 --> 01:30:01,491
The marriage cannot be done...
The girl hasn't seen the boy.

1130
01:30:01,896 --> 01:30:03,227
Go and do your work.

1131
01:30:31,184 --> 01:30:33,084
You called me, Maya

1132
01:30:36,089 --> 01:30:39,024
What is all this?

1133
01:30:49,102 --> 01:30:51,434
The sacred thread
of brotherhood.

1134
01:30:51,504 --> 01:30:54,029
I want to tie it on your wrist.

1135
01:30:54,207 --> 01:30:56,641
Is today 'Raksha Bandhan'?

1136
01:30:59,112 --> 01:31:01,774
'Raksha Bandhan' doesn't
have any special day.

1137
01:31:03,449 --> 01:31:06,111
In the olden days...
whenever sisters.

1138
01:31:06,186 --> 01:31:10,646
...felt the need, they
have used this 'Rakhi'.

1139
01:31:13,226 --> 01:31:15,717
I don't believe the old
customs and traditions.

1140
01:31:18,131 --> 01:31:23,000
A sister's love for a brother,
is it an old custom?

1141
01:31:26,072 --> 01:31:28,006
Yes?

1142
01:31:29,509 --> 01:31:32,501
What do you know what
is called love, Maya?

1143
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:36,014
Love is the name
of some emotion...

1144
01:31:36,082 --> 01:31:39,017
...that exists in the
mind. It isn't...

1145
01:31:39,085 --> 01:31:41,747
...something to shown around.

1146
01:32:05,111 --> 01:32:07,545
You will have to have
this Rakhi tied.

1147
01:32:07,614 --> 01:32:08,706
That same matter once again?

1148
01:32:08,781 --> 01:32:11,773
I don't like one person
worshipping other.

1149
01:32:13,453 --> 01:32:19,221
I am not worshipping.
Just tying this thread.

1150
01:32:19,459 --> 01:32:21,393
No...

1151
01:32:25,164 --> 01:32:28,395
What is your problem in this?

1152
01:32:28,468 --> 01:32:29,992
Very much.

1153
01:32:33,072 --> 01:32:35,734
I don't do anything
which I don't like.

1154
01:32:36,409 --> 01:32:42,405
Didn't you do anything in
life without your wishes?

1155
01:32:47,287 --> 01:32:50,017
Every year when
my friends used...

1156
01:32:50,089 --> 01:32:52,523
...to decorate their
brother's wrists...

1157
01:32:52,592 --> 01:32:55,755
...I used to clutch
walls and cry.

1158
01:32:57,363 --> 01:33:01,026
Today when God has
heard my plea...

1159
01:33:01,100 --> 01:33:07,630
...do you want to snatch this
happiness from me too?

1160
01:33:14,380 --> 01:33:16,541
So what?

1161
01:33:17,116 --> 01:33:20,142
You don't have any emotions
in your mind for me?

1162
01:33:20,219 --> 01:33:22,710
Maybe you cannot
reach it's depth.

1163
01:33:24,324 --> 01:33:26,315
And if you could reach...

1164
01:33:32,065 --> 01:33:34,499
You wouldn't try to
tie this Rakhi ever.

1165
01:34:28,488 --> 01:34:32,481
You are in haste.
Babu. Sit down.

1166
01:34:35,395 --> 01:34:37,386
Have a seat.

1167
01:34:40,066 --> 01:34:42,159
You are strange, Babu.

1168
01:34:42,235 --> 01:34:44,499
There is no news ever
since you have gone.

1169
01:34:44,570 --> 01:34:46,197
Where were you? What
about the work?

1170
01:34:46,272 --> 01:34:47,671
Everything will be done.

1171
01:34:48,274 --> 01:34:50,504
You say that whenever you come.

1172
01:34:50,576 --> 01:34:54,012
It will be done tomorrow.
It will be done today.

1173
01:34:54,080 --> 01:34:55,172
When will it be done after all?

1174
01:34:55,248 --> 01:34:57,216
Is it my mother's
garden to steal?

1175
01:34:58,084 --> 01:35:00,678
There is a mother
and father there.

1176
01:35:00,753 --> 01:35:02,015
There are so many people
living there.

1177
01:35:02,088 --> 01:35:03,180
Whose mother?

1178
01:35:03,256 --> 01:35:04,348
Whose father?

1179
01:35:04,424 --> 01:35:06,517
The old woman is blind.

1180
01:35:06,592 --> 01:35:09,755
The man has become blind
in his son's love.

1181
01:35:10,196 --> 01:35:15,031
So what is your problem in
emptying a filled safe?

1182
01:35:17,103 --> 01:35:18,434
See.

1183
01:35:18,504 --> 01:35:20,972
If a man fights with you,
you can fight him.

1184
01:35:21,040 --> 01:35:22,974
But when he answers you
abuses with love...

1185
01:35:23,042 --> 01:35:24,703
...how can you raise your
hand against him?

1186
01:35:27,046 --> 01:35:28,570
You will have to
raise your hand.

1187
01:35:28,648 --> 01:35:30,707
Give one slap to that old hag...

1188
01:35:31,250 --> 01:35:32,979
Don't you dare.

1189
01:35:33,052 --> 01:35:35,646
Don't you dare call
him an old man.

1190
01:35:36,055 --> 01:35:38,046
Wait.

1191
01:35:39,058 --> 01:35:41,049
This isn't needed.

1192
01:35:46,065 --> 01:35:48,397
He respects his father.

1193
01:35:48,468 --> 01:35:50,060
Whether I am not his son.

1194
01:35:50,136 --> 01:35:52,070
I had gone there to steal.

1195
01:35:52,138 --> 01:35:54,504
But he has called me
his son in his words.

1196
01:35:54,574 --> 01:35:56,405
And that girl, Maya...

1197
01:35:56,476 --> 01:35:58,501
I love her. That is what
you want me to say?

1198
01:35:58,578 --> 01:36:02,605
Okay. I love her. I can
give my life for her.

1199
01:36:06,419 --> 01:36:07,511
Listen, Babu.

1200
01:36:07,587 --> 01:36:11,353
The mother is okay.
The father is okay.

1201
01:36:11,424 --> 01:36:13,688
Even Maya's love is all right.

1202
01:36:13,759 --> 01:36:16,023
But I will tell you something.

1203
01:36:18,297 --> 01:36:20,231
You are a professional thief.

1204
01:36:20,299 --> 01:36:21,459
And this weakness
on top of that?

1205
01:36:21,534 --> 01:36:22,967
Stop this lecture of yours.

1206
01:36:23,135 --> 01:36:24,363
Are you concerned
with the money...

1207
01:36:24,437 --> 01:36:25,563
...or my personal life?

1208
01:36:25,638 --> 01:36:29,369
I need the money.
- You will get it.

1209
01:36:50,062 --> 01:36:52,724
What should I do now?

1210
01:36:53,332 --> 01:36:57,393
What I had thought earlier...
was right.

1211
01:36:58,070 --> 01:37:03,007
Kundan is not of the house.
He is a outsider.

1212
01:37:04,176 --> 01:37:06,610
And he has come
to fool everyone.

1213
01:37:08,080 --> 01:37:09,513
Mother...

1214
01:37:09,582 --> 01:37:11,345
What will happen to mother?

1215
01:37:12,084 --> 01:37:14,075
Father...

1216
01:37:15,288 --> 01:37:17,756
What should I do?

1217
01:37:20,026 --> 01:37:23,689
Whatever is the case.
I will have to tell.

1218
01:37:25,464 --> 01:37:29,025
What ever is the case.
I will have to tell.

1219
01:37:31,237 --> 01:37:33,569
I will tell everyone.

1220
01:38:01,267 --> 01:38:03,599
Kundan has gone away angrily.

1221
01:38:04,070 --> 01:38:06,163
God knows where he has gone.

1222
01:38:06,238 --> 01:38:08,399
What do you think? That
I can live without him?

1223
01:38:08,474 --> 01:38:10,738
Then why do you keep
on scolding him?

1224
01:38:11,077 --> 01:38:13,341
You had asked him a suggestion
for marriage.

1225
01:38:13,412 --> 01:38:16,006
What was the need of throwing
him out of the room?

1226
01:38:16,082 --> 01:38:17,606
He was speaking like fools.

1227
01:38:17,683 --> 01:38:21,449
Yes. You are speaking
very intelligently.

1228
01:38:22,021 --> 01:38:24,353
The son has come back
after twenty years.

1229
01:38:24,423 --> 01:38:27,688
If he goes away this time,
he will never return.

1230
01:38:29,028 --> 01:38:31,462
Then strangle me with
your own hands.

1231
01:38:31,530 --> 01:38:34,556
I will not be able to
live without my son.

1232
01:38:34,634 --> 01:38:36,033
Rukmini...

1233
01:38:36,102 --> 01:38:38,627
You are talking as
if he isn't my son.

1234
01:38:38,704 --> 01:38:39,966
Crazy woman...

1235
01:38:40,039 --> 01:38:43,372
Our old age will be
spent on his support.

1236
01:38:43,442 --> 01:38:45,467
Why are you talking like this?

1237
01:38:47,580 --> 01:38:49,138
Whatever you say will happen.

1238
01:38:49,215 --> 01:38:52,707
I will never meddle.
Silent now. Silent.

1239
01:39:11,270 --> 01:39:13,397
So what?

1240
01:39:13,472 --> 01:39:16,168
You don't have any emotions
in your mind for me?

1241
01:39:16,509 --> 01:39:19,410
So much that you cannot
reach its depth.

1242
01:39:21,013 --> 01:39:23,106
And if you could reach then...

1243
01:39:29,021 --> 01:39:31,012
...you wouldn't try to
tie this Rakhi ever.

1244
01:39:38,030 --> 01:39:39,361
So what if I am not their son.

1245
01:39:39,432 --> 01:39:41,127
I have gone there
to steal and rob.

1246
01:39:41,200 --> 01:39:43,498
But he has called me his
son in his own words.

1247
01:39:43,569 --> 01:39:45,560
And that girl, Maya...

1248
01:39:45,638 --> 01:39:47,503
You want me to say
that I love her?

1249
01:39:47,573 --> 01:39:51,475
Yes, okay. I love her. I can
sacrifice my life for her too.

1250
01:40:00,052 --> 01:40:02,316
He has gone away in anger.

1251
01:40:02,388 --> 01:40:04,583
God knows where he has gone.

1252
01:40:04,657 --> 01:40:06,591
Do you think that I
can live without him?

1253
01:40:06,659 --> 01:40:09,059
Yes. So why do you
keep scolding him?

1254
01:40:09,128 --> 01:40:12,063
You had asked him for a
suggestion in the marriage.

1255
01:40:12,131 --> 01:40:14,497
What was the need of throwing
him out of the room?

1256
01:40:14,567 --> 01:40:16,592
He was speaking so stupidly.

1257
01:40:16,669 --> 01:40:19,661
Yes. As if you were speaking
very intelligently.

1258
01:40:20,072 --> 01:40:22,666
The son has come back
after twenty years.

1259
01:40:23,175 --> 01:40:26,508
If he goes now, he will
never come back again.

1260
01:40:27,346 --> 01:40:30,611
Then strangle me with
your own hands.

1261
01:41:23,269 --> 01:41:29,003
In such a situation,
nothing can be said.

1262
01:41:44,290 --> 01:41:49,023
Whether he is mine
or a stranger.

1263
01:41:49,094 --> 01:41:53,428
Who will make me
understand that?

1264
01:41:53,499 --> 01:42:01,429
How can one keep relations
with a stranger?

1265
01:42:27,399 --> 01:42:30,994
The moon laughs the breeze...

1266
01:42:31,070 --> 01:42:34,597
...runs beneath the
peepal tree...

1267
01:42:34,673 --> 01:42:37,005
My veil...

1268
01:42:47,419 --> 01:42:51,617
It gets trapped in my hair.'

1269
01:43:00,099 --> 01:43:04,627
My mind stops sometimes
and it runs sometimes.

1270
01:43:19,385 --> 01:43:28,384
I follow it sometimes and
sometimes I run ahead.

1271
01:43:37,069 --> 01:43:41,597
One thought comes in the
mind and the other leaves.

1272
01:44:21,313 --> 01:44:25,977
Is this some thing too?

1273
01:44:26,051 --> 01:44:33,981
When the temple falls, the
idol is then prepared.

1274
01:44:38,330 --> 01:44:42,391
What should I do? I don't
understand anything.

1275
01:44:52,077 --> 01:44:53,408
Shahji...

1276
01:44:53,479 --> 01:44:56,175
Just take this here and...
- Silent. What are you saying?

1277
01:45:02,087 --> 01:45:04,419
Kundan. Please sit
down and help me.

1278
01:45:04,490 --> 01:45:06,014
When the daughter can
play with the mother...

1279
01:45:06,091 --> 01:45:07,353
...the son can play with
the father too.

1280
01:45:07,426 --> 01:45:09,360
Come on. Sit down.

1281
01:45:09,428 --> 01:45:11,362
What are you thinking, Maya?

1282
01:45:11,430 --> 01:45:13,421
Are we in danger?

1283
01:45:14,099 --> 01:45:18,627
Don't worry, mother.
I know every danger.

1284
01:45:21,306 --> 01:45:23,137
Take this. Take care
of your house.

1285
01:45:23,208 --> 01:45:25,301
This house has no danger now.

1286
01:45:25,377 --> 01:45:27,641
I am the guardian.

1287
01:45:30,382 --> 01:45:33,146
Maya... be careful.

1288
01:45:34,053 --> 01:45:36,521
Each and every of Kundan's
move is dangerous.

1289
01:45:37,322 --> 01:45:39,984
All of Kundan's moves
are of theft.

1290
01:45:41,060 --> 01:45:44,393
But I have an answer
to every move too.

1291
01:45:46,065 --> 01:45:48,158
If you see, he won't
play at all.

1292
01:45:48,233 --> 01:45:51,669
And if understood, it will
have to be changed.

1293
01:45:54,339 --> 01:45:56,398
You know too well.
Save your chief.

1294
01:45:56,608 --> 01:45:58,735
There are a hundred
moves in each move.

1295
01:45:59,278 --> 01:46:01,678
And I have a hundred
saves in my move.

1296
01:46:02,081 --> 01:46:03,514
Show it to me.

1297
01:46:03,582 --> 01:46:05,413
Come forward.

1298
01:46:07,086 --> 01:46:08,417
The chief in the place
of the chief.

1299
01:46:08,487 --> 01:46:10,352
And the king in the
place of the king.

1300
01:46:10,522 --> 01:46:12,353
Let someone touch at least.

1301
01:46:13,358 --> 01:46:15,417
Someone tell me,
what is the move?

1302
01:46:16,361 --> 01:46:18,693
The move is about
the house, mother.

1303
01:46:20,132 --> 01:46:24,694
I just have one move. The
rest... is all a trap.

1304
01:46:25,170 --> 01:46:28,367
Let me see what one does.

1305
01:46:28,440 --> 01:46:29,498
What rubbish are you speaking?

1306
01:46:29,575 --> 01:46:30,974
Why don't you speak properly?

1307
01:46:31,043 --> 01:46:34,376
The words are straight.
The night is bleak.

1308
01:46:35,247 --> 01:46:37,477
Your color won't work now.

1309
01:46:37,549 --> 01:46:39,642
Are you playing chess
of speaking puzzles?

1310
01:46:40,052 --> 01:46:41,986
I won't play.

1311
01:46:43,388 --> 01:46:44,480
What did you do, Maya?

1312
01:46:44,556 --> 01:46:45,989
You angered him without
any reason.

1313
01:46:46,158 --> 01:46:48,718
He isn't angry.
He lost the game.

1314
01:46:50,395 --> 01:46:54,491
He didn't lose, he won.

1315
01:47:21,360 --> 01:47:25,296
Madam... I have made this waist
chain especially for you.

1316
01:47:25,364 --> 01:47:27,298
And this chain.

1317
01:47:27,366 --> 01:47:30,130
There isn't the fashion
of chains now.

1318
01:47:30,202 --> 01:47:32,568
Are fashions something
to be adhered too?

1319
01:47:32,638 --> 01:47:35,368
You make the fashions,
and you take them out.

1320
01:47:35,440 --> 01:47:36,964
Wear them. And the fashions
will come back.

1321
01:47:37,142 --> 01:47:40,043
Ask the one who has to wear it.

1322
01:47:40,112 --> 01:47:41,170
What do you say, Maya?

1323
01:47:41,246 --> 01:47:42,975
Yes, child. Please
choose something.

1324
01:47:43,148 --> 01:47:45,378
Why do you bring me in between?

1325
01:47:45,450 --> 01:47:48,317
Kundan... come on.
Suggest something.

1326
01:47:48,387 --> 01:47:50,378
Shahji... I will suggest
something.

1327
01:47:50,455 --> 01:47:54,585
Keep whatever you like. I will
take the rest tomorrow.

1328
01:47:54,660 --> 01:47:57,595
Yes, I will have them sent. Go.
- Farewell.

1329
01:47:59,331 --> 01:48:00,389
Kundan...

1330
01:48:00,465 --> 01:48:01,523
Yes?

1331
01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:02,999
What are you doing
standing there?

1332
01:48:03,068 --> 01:48:05,195
Come here.

1333
01:48:05,270 --> 01:48:07,602
See, son. I don't understand
anything.

1334
01:48:08,073 --> 01:48:09,506
I have an idea.

1335
01:48:09,575 --> 01:48:13,409
Keep whatever jewellery
you like in this.

1336
01:48:13,478 --> 01:48:17,414
And return the rest.
Take these keys.

1337
01:48:18,283 --> 01:48:20,114
Now you look after everything.

1338
01:48:20,185 --> 01:48:22,619
Give us a holiday. What do
you say, Kundan's mother?

1339
01:48:24,223 --> 01:48:29,559
Listen son. I want to
tell you something.

1340
01:48:30,028 --> 01:48:33,361
When I was of your age, even...

1341
01:48:33,432 --> 01:48:36,367
...my father had given me
the keys like I have.

1342
01:48:37,236 --> 01:48:39,966
And at that time, he had
told me something.

1343
01:48:40,138 --> 01:48:42,698
I wish to tell that to you too.

1344
01:48:44,376 --> 01:48:46,139
He had told me...

1345
01:48:47,045 --> 01:48:48,376
Son...

1346
01:48:48,447 --> 01:48:50,244
You are the light of this house.

1347
01:48:50,315 --> 01:48:51,976
If brightness falls
in this house.

1348
01:48:52,050 --> 01:48:53,984
It will be because of you.

1349
01:48:54,052 --> 01:48:56,384
And if there is darkness,
it will be because of you.

1350
01:48:56,455 --> 01:48:58,719
The respect of this house
is in your hands now.

1351
01:49:39,131 --> 01:49:43,966
There is no destination
or companion.

1352
01:49:44,036 --> 01:49:49,030
There is no group
of people too.

1353
01:49:49,107 --> 01:49:53,976
This heart has made me walk.

1354
01:49:54,046 --> 01:49:59,712
Where is it taking me alone?

1355
01:50:35,220 --> 01:50:40,021
If I get some sympathizer
somewhere.

1356
01:50:40,092 --> 01:50:45,530
I am not that lucky.

1357
01:50:45,597 --> 01:50:50,193
The earth is careless.

1358
01:50:50,268 --> 01:50:55,103
And the sky is far away.

1359
01:51:58,103 --> 01:52:03,541
The roads are of
my own country.

1360
01:52:03,608 --> 01:52:08,204
Even then they are
a stranger to me.

1361
01:52:08,280 --> 01:52:17,120
Who will I call as my own?

1362
01:53:08,640 --> 01:53:13,043
I got on the house on stone.

1363
01:53:13,111 --> 01:53:17,445
I got a God who is
stone hearted.

1364
01:53:17,516 --> 01:53:25,480
Taking this glass heart...
where should I go?

1365
01:54:06,364 --> 01:54:08,764
Do you know that today is the
last night of your promise?

1366
01:54:09,301 --> 01:54:10,427
I know it.

1367
01:54:10,502 --> 01:54:13,369
So the work should be
done tonight itself.

1368
01:54:14,439 --> 01:54:16,031
When we have waited
for so many days...

1369
01:54:16,107 --> 01:54:18,302
...what will we lose if we wait
for a couple of days more?

1370
01:54:18,376 --> 01:54:19,434
We will lose a lot.

1371
01:54:19,511 --> 01:54:21,479
Within five days, the police
from Bombay can come here.

1372
01:54:21,546 --> 01:54:22,638
Within five days, your parents...

1373
01:54:22,714 --> 01:54:24,045
...can find out that you
are not their son.

1374
01:54:24,115 --> 01:54:28,381
Let the marriage be
done with and...

1375
01:54:28,453 --> 01:54:29,511
Marriage?
- Yes.

1376
01:54:29,588 --> 01:54:31,385
What better chance will
you get than marriage?

1377
01:54:31,456 --> 01:54:32,980
There will be clothes
at this time.

1378
01:54:33,058 --> 01:54:34,491
There will be money
and jewellery.

1379
01:54:34,559 --> 01:54:36,993
The house hold members will
be busy in parties.

1380
01:54:37,062 --> 01:54:38,996
Nobody will even think about...

1381
01:54:39,064 --> 01:54:40,998
...the son and the
safe of the house.

1382
01:54:42,334 --> 01:54:44,734
I know that you will
do this work.

1383
01:54:45,270 --> 01:54:47,500
You will do it tonight.

1384
01:54:48,273 --> 01:54:52,733
Remember, I will wait for you
at three in the night tomorrow.

1385
01:54:53,178 --> 01:54:56,409
And you will come with the
clothes and jewellery here.

1386
01:54:56,481 --> 01:54:58,005
You will surely come.

1387
01:55:36,054 --> 01:55:37,988
I think that this matter
is a bit problematic.

1388
01:55:38,056 --> 01:55:39,387
What do you mean?

1389
01:55:39,457 --> 01:55:42,722
Will he take all the
wealth being the son?

1390
01:55:45,263 --> 01:55:47,595
I have a solution for that.

1391
01:55:48,333 --> 01:55:49,994
I will kill him
at such a place...

1392
01:55:50,068 --> 01:55:52,002
...where he won't even
get any water.

1393
01:56:58,069 --> 01:56:59,400
Is lost.

1394
01:56:59,471 --> 01:57:02,406
A Punjabi boy, who
is five years old.

1395
01:57:02,474 --> 01:57:04,601
He is fair and his height
is three feet.

1396
01:57:04,676 --> 01:57:07,008
He has worn a ring in his hand.

1397
01:57:07,078 --> 01:57:09,512
Whose picture is
given down below.

1398
01:57:19,357 --> 01:57:21,348
One boy who has died.

1399
01:57:22,360 --> 01:57:24,555
Twenty years from now.

1400
01:57:25,029 --> 01:57:27,361
When he was just five years old.

1401
01:57:27,432 --> 01:57:29,957
Away from his house
hold members.

1402
01:57:30,034 --> 01:57:31,365
Mother...

1403
01:57:31,436 --> 01:57:32,960
Father...

1404
01:57:33,037 --> 01:57:34,971
Sister...

1405
01:57:35,039 --> 01:57:37,132
He doesn't remember anything.

1406
01:57:37,208 --> 01:57:39,972
Only this one symbol
is left now.

1407
01:57:51,256 --> 01:57:53,315
I think that we should go there.

1408
01:57:53,391 --> 01:57:54,983
Come on.

1409
01:58:28,226 --> 01:58:30,353
Babu... what are you doing?

1410
01:58:31,129 --> 01:58:33,563
You are returning
the goods you took?

1411
01:58:37,235 --> 01:58:38,964
No body will take the
wealth from here.

1412
01:58:39,037 --> 01:58:40,971
What is the matter?

1413
01:58:42,240 --> 01:58:43,969
I beg of you.

1414
01:58:44,042 --> 01:58:45,976
Five thousand... ten thousand...
twenty thousand...

1415
01:58:46,044 --> 01:58:48,035
Munna.

1416
01:59:08,266 --> 01:59:10,598
What happened?

1417
01:59:11,336 --> 01:59:13,327
Blood...

1418
01:59:15,273 --> 01:59:17,332
That thief took everything
that we had.

1419
01:59:17,609 --> 01:59:20,009
Money... jewellery...
everything we had.

1420
01:59:23,014 --> 01:59:24,538
I will follow him. I will
snatch something from him.

1421
01:59:24,616 --> 01:59:26,447
No...
- Let me go... - No, don't go.

1422
01:59:26,517 --> 01:59:28,109
They won't leave you alive.

1423
01:59:32,023 --> 01:59:34,014
For me.

1424
01:59:36,027 --> 01:59:38,495
I ran away from the chess
game at that time.

1425
01:59:39,030 --> 01:59:40,964
But I cannot run away
from the game of life.

1426
01:59:51,309 --> 01:59:53,368
Father...

1427
01:59:53,444 --> 01:59:55,503
What happened?
- What happened?

1428
01:59:57,048 --> 01:59:58,310
Thief... thief...
- Thief...

1429
01:59:58,383 --> 01:59:59,975
Uncle... Kundan...

1430
02:00:00,051 --> 02:00:01,985
Father... Kundan too.

1431
02:00:02,053 --> 02:00:03,315
What happened to Kundan?

1432
02:00:03,388 --> 02:00:05,185
What happened to Kundan?

1433
02:00:05,256 --> 02:00:06,382
Tell me something too.

1434
02:00:06,457 --> 02:00:07,515
Tell me, what happened
to Kundan?

1435
02:00:07,592 --> 02:00:09,184
Kundan tried to save.

1436
02:00:09,260 --> 02:00:11,387
But the thieves hit him
and made him fall.

1437
02:00:11,462 --> 02:00:13,327
Shut up. Let me listen
to the whole matter.

1438
02:00:13,398 --> 02:00:15,389
Yes, tell me. What happened?

1439
02:00:15,466 --> 02:00:17,491
He has gone to catch
the thieves...

1440
02:00:17,568 --> 02:00:19,502
Yes? Daughter... tell me.
- Father...

1441
02:00:19,570 --> 02:00:22,004
They have taken all
the jewellery...

1442
02:00:22,073 --> 02:00:24,405
All the jewellery...

1443
02:00:24,475 --> 02:00:25,533
What are you staring at?

1444
02:00:25,610 --> 02:00:27,407
Go. Kundan is unarmed. Go.

1445
02:00:27,478 --> 02:00:29,070
Take as many men as you want.

1446
02:00:29,147 --> 02:00:31,012
Tell the police. Go! Go!

1447
02:00:59,110 --> 02:01:01,044
Did you find out anything
about Kundan?

1448
02:01:01,112 --> 02:01:05,048
No... why are you sitting
silent here?

1449
02:01:05,116 --> 02:01:06,549
What will be got if
you sit silent?

1450
02:01:06,617 --> 02:01:08,710
The marriage procession
is waiting there.

1451
02:01:10,121 --> 02:01:12,055
You aren't ready yet?

1452
02:01:12,123 --> 02:01:14,648
Bansi... get up. Go
and get Maya ready.

1453
02:01:14,726 --> 02:01:16,057
Have her wear the new attire.

1454
02:01:16,127 --> 02:01:18,652
What attire and what marriage?

1455
02:01:18,730 --> 02:01:20,061
Please don't say like this.

1456
02:01:22,166 --> 02:01:24,157
Shahji... please get up.

1457
02:01:24,235 --> 02:01:25,395
There are just two hours
left for the marriage.

1458
02:01:25,470 --> 02:01:26,596
Why are you shouting?

1459
02:01:26,671 --> 02:01:28,002
Where am I shouting?

1460
02:01:28,072 --> 02:01:30,336
It is the question of the
respect of the house.

1461
02:01:33,177 --> 02:01:35,407
Uncle...

1462
02:01:35,480 --> 02:01:37,414
Where is the respect of
the house left now?

1463
02:01:37,482 --> 02:01:39,006
No. Brother...

1464
02:03:11,442 --> 02:03:14,036
I feel so pity on Maya.

1465
02:03:16,114 --> 02:03:18,105
Dasumal...

1466
02:03:20,051 --> 02:03:22,042
Dasumal... did you
find something out?

1467
02:03:22,120 --> 02:03:23,178
No, Shahji.

1468
02:03:23,254 --> 02:03:24,312
We don't know anything about...

1469
02:03:24,388 --> 02:03:25,980
...neither the thieves
or the son.

1470
02:03:27,391 --> 02:03:29,382
Oh...

1471
02:03:29,460 --> 02:03:33,157
What will happen
if we lose hope?

1472
02:03:33,331 --> 02:03:37,062
Maya... you get ready. We will
see what will happen.

1473
02:03:37,135 --> 02:03:39,399
Kalsui... go. Get Maya ready.

1474
02:03:48,279 --> 02:03:50,338
Shahji...

1475
02:03:50,414 --> 02:03:52,507
I am getting the marriage
procession.

1476
02:05:43,394 --> 02:05:45,988
Maybe you wanted to hear from...

1477
02:05:46,063 --> 02:05:48,395
...my mouth why I don't
rob from that house.

1478
02:05:49,400 --> 02:05:50,992
Listen today.

1479
02:05:51,168 --> 02:05:53,500
I am the murderer of that man...

1480
02:05:53,571 --> 02:05:56,597
...who was the son of that
old mother and father.

1481
02:05:56,674 --> 02:05:59,507
Their son is not alive.
He is dead.

1482
02:05:59,577 --> 02:06:03,013
And he died at these hands.

1483
02:06:03,080 --> 02:06:04,206
What are you saying?

1484
02:06:04,282 --> 02:06:07,410
I am saying that don't look
towards that house.

1485
02:06:07,485 --> 02:06:08,611
That is my house.

1486
02:06:08,686 --> 02:06:11,086
My parents stay there.
I am their son.

1487
02:06:11,422 --> 02:06:15,620
If anyone comes to know
this secret from you.

1488
02:06:17,094 --> 02:06:19,085
Then remember...

1489
02:06:27,305 --> 02:06:29,466
Shahji...

1490
02:06:29,540 --> 02:06:32,031
You are just sitting
like this till now?

1491
02:06:32,109 --> 02:06:33,371
Wash up, and change clothes.

1492
02:06:33,444 --> 02:06:35,309
Wear your turban. The
procession has come.

1493
02:06:36,314 --> 02:06:38,373
Procession?

1494
02:06:38,449 --> 02:06:40,314
What kind of procession?

1495
02:06:40,384 --> 02:06:42,579
Uncle, tell them to take
the procession back.

1496
02:06:43,154 --> 02:06:48,182
I am poor and I don't have
anything. All this is false show!

1497
02:06:48,259 --> 02:06:51,057
I drank and gambled all my life.

1498
02:06:51,128 --> 02:06:54,495
Please don't say like this.

1499
02:06:54,565 --> 02:06:56,726
I am right, old woman.

1500
02:06:57,335 --> 02:07:01,601
If I had earned the right way,
it won't go like this.

1501
02:07:02,073 --> 02:07:06,169
Someone put ashes on
my head, put mud...

1502
02:07:06,410 --> 02:07:09,208
No... no... enough...

1503
02:07:16,620 --> 02:07:18,679
It seems...

1504
02:07:20,024 --> 02:07:22,959
This voice is of my funeral.

1505
02:07:24,028 --> 02:07:26,690
Kill me with your own
hands before that.

1506
02:07:27,298 --> 02:07:29,630
But don't say such things.

1507
02:07:29,700 --> 02:07:31,292
Kundan...

1508
02:07:34,038 --> 02:07:35,300
Shahji...

1509
02:07:35,373 --> 02:07:36,465
Shahji...

1510
02:07:36,540 --> 02:07:37,632
Where are you?

1511
02:07:37,708 --> 02:07:38,970
Where have you been?

1512
02:07:41,112 --> 02:07:43,979
Kundan... Kundan...

1513
02:07:44,048 --> 02:07:46,039
Are you wounded?

1514
02:07:46,150 --> 02:07:48,380
Maya... Maya...

1515
02:07:48,452 --> 02:07:50,716
Why are you staring at me?
Get some water, go.

1516
02:07:51,055 --> 02:07:54,491
Please don't worry about me.
I'll be all right.

1517
02:07:54,558 --> 02:07:56,992
I am all right. Make
arrangements for the marriage.

1518
02:07:57,061 --> 02:07:59,655
We don't have much time.

1519
02:08:00,164 --> 02:08:01,995
What are you staring at?
Take the jewellery...

1520
02:08:02,066 --> 02:08:04,500
...and take it inside.
Go. Quickly.

1521
02:08:12,276 --> 02:08:14,744
Go, father. Get ready quickly.

1522
02:08:16,280 --> 02:08:18,339
What are you thinking about?

1523
02:08:21,018 --> 02:08:23,350
Today, I know...

1524
02:08:23,421 --> 02:08:26,447
Why people ask for sons...

1525
02:09:19,276 --> 02:09:20,937
Come with me, Babu...

1526
02:09:24,215 --> 02:09:27,446
I know why you have
come, Inspector.

1527
02:09:29,353 --> 02:09:31,446
But I am sorry that you have...

1528
02:09:31,522 --> 02:09:35,356
...come at such a time when...

1529
02:09:35,426 --> 02:09:39,487
...the repentance of my
crimes is starting.

1530
02:09:39,563 --> 02:09:41,121
What do you mean?

1531
02:09:42,032 --> 02:09:45,468
I mean that Balli was the
son of this house. - Babu...

1532
02:09:45,536 --> 02:09:50,132
And I wished that I stay in
this house all through my life.

1533
02:09:50,207 --> 02:09:52,368
I am so happy today, Babu.

1534
02:09:53,377 --> 02:09:56,039
I can see you as I wanted to
see you all through my life.

1535
02:09:56,113 --> 02:09:57,978
You are the brightness
of a mother's eyes.

1536
02:09:58,048 --> 02:10:00,642
And you are the pride
of a father's eyes.

1537
02:10:02,052 --> 02:10:03,314
What do you mean?

1538
02:10:03,387 --> 02:10:05,582
Not as a police officer...

1539
02:10:05,656 --> 02:10:10,650
But as a friend, I wish
that you be freed.

1540
02:10:12,162 --> 02:10:16,394
Are you telling the truth?

1541
02:10:16,467 --> 02:10:17,991
Yes.

1542
02:10:18,068 --> 02:10:19,501
Go.

1543
02:10:19,570 --> 02:10:22,004
They need you at this time.

1544
02:10:22,072 --> 02:10:23,403
Go.

1545
02:10:23,474 --> 02:10:25,738
What are you thinking about? Go.

1546
02:10:46,297 --> 02:10:47,355
Hey...

1547
02:10:47,431 --> 02:10:49,023
What are you doing here?

1548
02:10:49,099 --> 02:10:51,090
It is time for the palanquin
to go. Come on.

1549
02:11:44,088 --> 02:11:49,617
Come on, my beloved, what
are you thinking now?

1550
02:11:59,303 --> 02:12:04,434
The flowers shouldn't
drown while crying.

1551
02:12:24,595 --> 02:12:29,498
The father repents all over.

1552
02:12:29,566 --> 02:12:35,596
Why did he send the apple of
his eyes to other's house?

1553
02:12:50,087 --> 02:12:55,753
He has tears and thinks about
this standing afar.

1554
02:13:31,261 --> 02:13:36,528
The lap of love and
the games of dolls.

1555
02:13:36,600 --> 02:13:39,068
The young and elder friends.

1556
02:13:39,136 --> 02:13:42,071
The house, the
path and garden.

1557
02:13:57,087 --> 02:14:02,081
All is lost... all is lost...
all is lost...

1558
02:14:43,267 --> 02:14:48,000
She is standing like a bride.

1559
02:14:48,071 --> 02:14:53,407
There is nobody
to call her own.

1560
02:15:08,091 --> 02:15:10,616
Someone is here,
someone is there.

1561
02:15:10,694 --> 02:15:13,527
And where is someone else?

1562
02:15:26,043 --> 02:15:27,977
You won't say anything?

1563
02:15:28,045 --> 02:15:32,482
I told you everything
that I shouldn't.

1564
02:15:33,584 --> 02:15:35,984
Now when I want to
say something...

1565
02:15:36,053 --> 02:15:38,521
...I can't tell you anything.
- Don't say like this.

1566
02:15:39,256 --> 02:15:41,588
I am so unfortunate.

1567
02:15:42,326 --> 02:15:45,318
When you were in the house,
I was an outsider.

1568
02:15:46,063 --> 02:15:48,395
When I have become
of the house...

1569
02:15:48,465 --> 02:15:50,160
...you have become an outsider.

1570
02:15:50,234 --> 02:15:54,603
You are saying what you
shouldn't say again.

1571
02:15:56,273 --> 02:16:00,175
I... I know everything.

1572
02:16:02,079 --> 02:16:04,411
You tried to fool everyone.

1573
02:16:05,082 --> 02:16:08,540
But you were the one
who was fooled.

1574
02:16:10,087 --> 02:16:12,555
All of us are happy in a trick.

1575
02:16:13,423 --> 02:16:15,015
Mother...

1576
02:16:15,092 --> 02:16:17,424
Father...

1577
02:16:18,095 --> 02:16:20,029
You...

1578
02:16:22,032 --> 02:16:23,966
Me...

1579
02:16:25,135 --> 02:16:27,968
What we were searching for
since so many years...

1580
02:16:30,040 --> 02:16:32,031
We have got it today.

1581
02:16:35,145 --> 02:16:40,310
You have got everything
that you searched for.
