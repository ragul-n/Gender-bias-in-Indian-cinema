1
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,163
Nandini...

2
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,688
Let me sleep

3
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:03,497
"Happy birthday, brother.
- Many happy returns of the day"

4
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:07,704
"Carrot-halwa. You love it, don't you?
- Help yourself"

5
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:09,030
Go on

6
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:14,712
He's angry because Nandini
hasn't been married

7
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:18,382
What can I do? I tried so much
to convince her...

8
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:21,050
but she just doesn't approve
of a suitor

9
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:27,022
Try Patel's son...
- He's an ape! A monkey!

10
00:05:28,861 --> 00:05:30,260
He's a monkey

11
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:37,732
And you shut up!
- We must fulfill our promise to him

12
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:42,733
"Without his support, I wouldn't have
had a roof over my head in Canada"

13
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:45,408
He was such a great man...
- So we must marry her off to a monkey?

14
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:47,679
What monkey?
He doesn't even have a tail

15
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,678
It's Papa's birthday

16
00:06:05,898 --> 00:06:08,128
It's ten already and you still
haven't gone to the restaurant

17
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:12,700
You're always harping on my marriage!
You just aren't bothered about your work

18
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:19,508
Go on now... hurry up!
- But how about your marriage?

19
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:23,714
"Really? I'm going to report you
to Papa. See, Papa...?"

20
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:48,468
Where were you all these days?

21
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:51,333
Know how difficult it was to
get tickets to the concert?

22
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:03,346
"They're at the restaurant, where else?
Come here immediately"

23
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,703
What serious business
did you want to discuss?

24
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:30,180
You are our business partner
in this restaurant...

25
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:33,383
and you've been taking care of this
eatery for the last seven years

26
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:35,710
I haven't even received any salary

27
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:40,388
You have no one of your own. Shouldn't
you be thinking about yourself?

28
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:43,786
Why must I? You guys are here
to think about me

29
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:47,666
And so we've thought of
getting you married. To Nandini

30
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:54,068
Marry Nandini? Are you guys crazy?
- We know you're in love with Nandini

31
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:56,671
Don't you like Nandini?
- I do

32
00:07:57,777 --> 00:08:01,008
But I've never thought of marrying her.
- There's no problem in thinking

33
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:04,077
Nandini won't find
a better boy than you

34
00:08:04,717 --> 00:08:08,084
"Besides, you have no one
in the world"

35
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:12,351
The two of you will be so happy
if you are married to each other

36
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:16,253
lt'll make brother so happy too.
- True...

37
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:19,961
but Nandini's a very dear friend.
If I spoke marriage with her...

38
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:23,359
I'd probably be...
- Endangering your friendship?

39
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:38,440
The two of them mean everything to me

40
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:48,325
How can I get married and go away?
I could never do it

41
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:56,467
"Now tell me, how can I marry
a man I don't even know?"

42
00:08:57,436 --> 00:09:01,338
"Someone must come along, marry me
and take me away"

43
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:07,670
Which movie did we see together?
Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge

44
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:24,695
"So you aren't going to get married?
- Oh no, let's see"

45
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:29,229
Will you marry me?

46
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:02,657
It's the call of the heart

47
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,692
"It's the call of my heart, my love.
Come to me"

48
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:36,458
"I wait for you...
do not torment me anymore"

49
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:41,903
"Come, drive my loneliness away"

50
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:47,909
"Everything is so dull without you.
Where are you...?"

51
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:50,645
Come to me

52
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:22,337
"You are the one I dream of,
you are the one I always think of..."

53
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:27,471
"you are the only one
who lives in my restless heart"

54
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:32,181
"So come to me, my love"

55
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,919
"It's the call of my heart, my love.
Come to me"

56
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:42,388
"I wait for you...
do not torment me anymore"

57
00:12:44,296 --> 00:12:48,426
"Come, drive my loneliness away"

58
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:53,628
"Everything is so dull without you.
Where are you...?"

59
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,237
Come to me

60
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:11,806
"You are the one
I love to behold..."

61
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:15,645
"you are the shining star
of my fortunes"

62
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:21,649
"Come to me, my love"

63
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:25,458
"It's the call of my heart, my love.
Come to me"

64
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:31,861
"I wait for you...
do not torment me anymore"

65
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:37,367
"Come, drive my loneliness away"

66
00:14:38,844 --> 00:14:42,803
"Everything is so dull without you.
Where are you...?"

67
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:48,476
Come to me

68
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:58,689
"My heart calls out to you.
Come to me, my love"

69
00:15:02,701 --> 00:15:06,501
"I pine for you...
do not make me pine anymore"

70
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:13,276
"Come, drive my loneliness away..."

71
00:15:13,712 --> 00:15:16,374
"for the world is bereft
of any excitement without you..."

72
00:15:16,715 --> 00:15:18,114
where are you...?

73
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:40,538
What...? Where...?
How did it happen?

74
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:44,737
Where are you held up...?
What is the matter?

75
00:15:45,911 --> 00:15:49,347
Don't worry. I'm coming over.
- What happened?

76
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:52,845
My uncle was coming to see me and the
police in Los Angeles caught him

77
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:55,176
It has something to do with
his passport. I must go there

78
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:57,685
"I'll go with you.
- No, I'm going with him"

79
00:15:58,023 --> 00:15:59,684
I know those guys

80
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:21,508
"If Ballu's uncle has an immigration
problem, enquire at the lmmigration"

81
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:25,110
"But he was staying at your place,
wasn't he?"

82
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:28,881
Haven't they contacted him yet?
- Haven't you been contacted either?

83
00:16:30,422 --> 00:16:32,185
Ask at the lmmigration

84
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,521
One moment

85
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:51,466
Ravi... how's Ma?

86
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:57,811
It's Shekhar here from Canada.
How's Ma...?

87
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:02,145
I can't hear a word.
How's Dadu?

88
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:06,015
It's Shekhar from Canada...
how's Ma?

89
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:22,440
Ravi... how's Ma?

90
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,704
It's Shekhar! From Canada!

91
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:32,717
"Who are you talking to, Shekhar?"

92
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:38,353
Who planted the bomb...?

93
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:42,724
Go there and check it out immediately.
Immediately...

94
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:47,890
"Say something, damn it!
It's Shekhar here!"

95
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:57,403
"Ravi, go to Ma! Go to Ma!
Lmmediately"

96
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:01,837
"Who are Ma and Dadu, Shekhar?"

97
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:09,011
Why do you need this money?
What is the matter?

98
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,449
Tell me what you are looking for

99
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:20,097
Why do you need the passport?
Where are you going?

100
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:36,180
Where are you going...?
I'm going with you too!

101
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:37,504
No!

102
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:11,342
Ma... my Ma...

103
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:11,671
Let's go. The train's leaving
in five minutes

104
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,368
Shekhar!

105
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:51,311
Uncle...?
- My boy!

106
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:55,313
My darling boy!
I was looking for you!

107
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:57,986
"Where have you been?
- I was in Canada, Uncle"

108
00:20:58,357 --> 00:21:03,989
"This is my wife. And this is my son.
- Very sweet boy, I say"

109
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:09,300
And your wife is very beautiful too.
Very good looking...

110
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:12,330
"very tempting...
- We must leave now, Uncle"

111
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:14,662
"We might miss the bus,
we're getting late"

112
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:18,875
Go on. And do bring
your wife to my place

113
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:31,379
"She was sizzling, all right"

114
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:35,421
It felt as if I put my hand
on something steaming

115
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:37,752
She's going to be great fun!

116
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:41,230
She's a butter-ball...
an imported one at that

117
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:44,032
Where's Beechha?

118
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:34,674
Lay off!

119
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:53,136
Come on... get down!

120
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,632
"Get down, you bastard!"

121
00:22:59,811 --> 00:23:02,837
See how he's struggling.
Get the bastard

122
00:23:39,885 --> 00:23:42,149
Wait! Nobody shoots!

123
00:23:42,554 --> 00:23:44,818
Can't you guys hear me?
Nobody shoots!

124
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:49,091
Wait there...
nobody shoots!

125
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:53,831
"Can't you bloody well hear me?
Nobody shoots, I say!"

126
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:57,295
Hear that...? Do you?

127
00:23:57,736 --> 00:24:00,296
"What do you want to do, uncle?
Kill each other?"

128
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:04,302
Here... kill me! Kill me!
But nobody opens fire

129
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:07,305
Nobody fires!

130
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:20,449
Hurry up! Get the vans
out of here

131
00:24:59,865 --> 00:25:03,426
Are you mad? Couldn't you
send word that you were coming?

132
00:25:03,768 --> 00:25:06,362
"Had we not come on time,
I don't know what would happen today"

133
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:09,003
They'd have bumped him off!
- Shut up

134
00:25:09,574 --> 00:25:11,872
"Who is she?
- How's Ma, Uncle?"

135
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:25,178
Where's Shekhar...?
Put that gun away!

136
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:36,132
"How are you, my friend?
- And how are you?"

137
00:25:36,468 --> 00:25:39,403
"You aren't hurt, are you?
- Forget it. This place hasn't changed"

138
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:42,298
Where did you pinch this uniform from?
- What rubbish

139
00:25:42,741 --> 00:25:45,073
I have become an Inspector.
And I'm posted in this very area

140
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:47,674
Let's talk in the car.
I've got to meet Ma

141
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,046
"At Dadu's? No, not today.
- Why not?"

142
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:54,409
Dadu's bound to hit back for this.
And I'll have to handle it

143
00:25:57,022 --> 00:26:01,550
"Nandini... my wife.
And this Pratap, my childhood friend"

144
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:04,521
"He's actually seven years older,
but he says he's younger"

145
00:26:04,863 --> 00:26:07,832
See you later.
- All right

146
00:26:36,728 --> 00:26:38,389
Enough

147
00:27:16,434 --> 00:27:18,197
Walk over it

148
00:27:19,704 --> 00:27:23,697
Tell her! It's the custom.
- I can't do this

149
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:34,268
"How's Ma, Dadu?"

150
00:28:38,249 --> 00:28:39,944
Is she all right?

151
00:28:44,456 --> 00:28:51,328
"Where did you pick up this girl?
- It's Nandini, my wife"

152
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:58,994
"I wanted to tell you, but it happened
so suddenly. We got married in a temple"

153
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:03,340
"Your kid?
- Yes, he's my son"

154
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:10,672
What do you call him?
- Raja... Rajeshwar

155
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:15,678
Old man!

156
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:22,683
Well?
- Well?

157
00:29:25,396 --> 00:29:27,364
"A tiger's cub, all right!"

158
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:31,926
Old man... take a look at this

159
00:29:34,372 --> 00:29:36,704
Ask her to wear decent clothes

160
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:42,369
Here you are.
Your great grandson! Rajeshwar!

161
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:44,705
He has been named after you

162
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:48,385
The rascal got married out there

163
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,950
He didn't consider it necessary
to inform us

164
00:29:52,557 --> 00:29:56,049
And this is his woman...
give them your blessings. Go on!

165
00:29:58,663 --> 00:30:00,654
This is your great grandfather

166
00:30:01,866 --> 00:30:06,667
"He can't move, he has no teeth...
but he's still a fighter"

167
00:30:07,372 --> 00:30:09,840
"Your great grandson,
my grandson"

168
00:30:11,676 --> 00:30:12,665
Greet him

169
00:30:14,412 --> 00:30:18,849
Brother Shekhar!
You forgot all of us?

170
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:22,351
Sister-in-law! Hello!
And my nephew...

171
00:30:22,687 --> 00:30:26,680
How's Ma?
- She's all right. Come with me

172
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:32,357
"He loves his mother very much...
been away for eight years, after all"

173
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:36,694
Why's he so late?
- Ma...

174
00:30:38,703 --> 00:30:40,694
Are you all right?
- Well...?

175
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:47,405
Does anyone forget his Ma like this?
Where did you leave me and go away?

176
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:51,941
Don't you know?
I can't live without you

177
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:56,313
Every time the crow cawed
on the window-sill...

178
00:30:56,654 --> 00:31:01,887
I said Shekhar was coming.
And you...?

179
00:31:02,727 --> 00:31:08,427
You come after all these years?
And you're the only one I have

180
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:14,661
I'm here now... isn't it?
Isn't it?

181
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:25,274
Who's this girl?
- Your daughter-in-law

182
00:31:26,251 --> 00:31:28,811
My daughter-in-law...?
Go and fetch the ceremonial plate

183
00:31:29,153 --> 00:31:33,487
"You got married...?
Come, come and sit here"

184
00:31:41,766 --> 00:31:43,757
May you be happily married

185
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:50,101
She looks like a real Goddess.
She's very beautiful

186
00:31:50,441 --> 00:31:54,036
"Not better looking than I am, is she?
- She's far better"

187
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:56,341
What is your name?
- Nandini

188
00:31:56,648 --> 00:31:59,208
I didn't ask you.
I want to hear her voice

189
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:01,040
What is your name?

190
00:32:02,453 --> 00:32:03,442
Nice name

191
00:32:03,788 --> 00:32:08,657
This is your grandson.
- His name is Raja

192
00:32:12,363 --> 00:32:14,456
"How are you?
- I'm all right, brother"

193
00:32:14,832 --> 00:32:20,793
"Nandini, this is my sister.
- Sister-in-law is very beautiful"

194
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:26,137
So they tried to kill my son

195
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,774
And who was it?
Your mistress's son

196
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:35,685
You weren't satisfied
with one wife

197
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:43,024
You will sacrifice my son to let my
step-mother's soul find peace

198
00:32:45,263 --> 00:32:48,699
They'll shoot at Shekhar?
At Shekhar...?

199
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:57,768
Narsimha's entire family
is here right now

200
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:01,043
Let's finish all of them
and take control...

201
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:08,080
"of the mansion, 40 villages,
4000 families..."

202
00:33:09,554 --> 00:33:12,318
they'll all be at your feet

203
00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:16,819
Their women will be my whores...

204
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:26,133
and they will bear me bastards.
It'll sure be fun

205
00:33:28,373 --> 00:33:33,333
"Guns, bullets, explosions...
and an obsession with revenge"

206
00:33:33,811 --> 00:33:38,214
That's just what has happened
in this family... in this region

207
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:43,677
This is just the tradition that
has been passed down

208
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:47,624
The enemy isn't anyone else...
it's my own uncle

209
00:33:48,626 --> 00:33:51,288
"After my sister's wedding,
we were on our way to a temple..."

210
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:54,321
when Uncle Beechha launched
a grenade attack on us

211
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:57,357
My brother-in-law was
blown to pieces

212
00:33:57,635 --> 00:34:00,627
My sister's hands and my face
were smeared with blood

213
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:04,638
Grandfather lay motionless
and Dadu was screaming away

214
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:12,539
Although I'm the sole heir
in the family...

215
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,912
I wanted to go away
from all the violence

216
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:20,050
So I studied very hard
and went away to Canada

217
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:23,650
That is where I met you...

218
00:34:24,662 --> 00:34:26,892
"and for the first time in my life,
I had found some peace"

219
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:33,464
"For fear of losing you,
I hid the truth from you"

220
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:40,477
But when I heard about Ma...
I couldn't stop myself

221
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,874
"I love my Ma very much, Nandini"

222
00:34:57,695 --> 00:35:01,358
"Shekhar, I'm very scared"

223
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:12,440
"Nandini, I've come home
after a very long time"

224
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:16,269
I want to spend some days
with Ma

225
00:35:55,753 --> 00:35:59,689
What are you whispering to him?
Eat all you want

226
00:36:00,391 --> 00:36:04,794
"If you knew food gave you strength,
you wouldn't have been so spineless"

227
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:08,421
Here... have some chillis

228
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,363
"It strengthens your heart,
you'll at least be a real man..."

229
00:36:12,703 --> 00:36:14,694
and you won't run away again!

230
00:36:17,441 --> 00:36:20,501
Why're you bothering your son?
He has returned after so many years

231
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:23,370
You won't even let him eat in peace?
- Because of your mollycoddling...

232
00:36:23,714 --> 00:36:27,946
he has become a bloody eunuch.
He ran away...

233
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:32,120
because you always pampered him.
You've made a coward out of him

234
00:36:32,456 --> 00:36:35,186
"A paper-tiger! He won't roar,
he won't bite"

235
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:37,926
What is the matter?
- I'm not hungry

236
00:36:41,732 --> 00:36:44,462
Madam doesn't like our food

237
00:36:45,436 --> 00:36:47,404
Does she eat diamonds
in her country?

238
00:36:50,675 --> 00:36:53,007
Why's he running after his wife...?

239
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:56,676
"Is he really my son,
or is he someone else's?"

240
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:28,837
"What happened, Nandini?"

241
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:35,715
"Are you all right?
- Yes Nandini, I'm fine..."

242
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:40,313
What happened...?

243
00:37:41,726 --> 00:37:44,422
What is the matter?
Why are you so scared?

244
00:37:44,729 --> 00:37:48,426
"Shekhar, I want to talk
to my Uncle Ballu"

245
00:37:56,674 --> 00:37:59,336
"This one is better, isn't it?"

246
00:38:04,682 --> 00:38:05,671
Shut up

247
00:38:11,822 --> 00:38:15,349
Nobody's taking the phone at home.
- So try the cell-phone

248
00:38:15,693 --> 00:38:18,184
The call just isn't going through.
I've tried so much

249
00:38:19,697 --> 00:38:22,689
We'll try tomorrow.
Let's go... we're getting late

250
00:38:25,569 --> 00:38:28,265
Must so many people accompany us
even when we want to make a phone call?

251
00:38:45,523 --> 00:38:46,512
Well?

252
00:39:01,572 --> 00:39:02,561
What happened?

253
00:39:04,575 --> 00:39:06,236
"Sit down, sister-in-law"

254
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:31,191
Naughty!

255
00:40:10,674 --> 00:40:13,370
See...
how does she look?

256
00:40:28,793 --> 00:40:31,455
"Sit here, dear.
- No, you sit down"

257
00:40:31,796 --> 00:40:33,696
Sit down quietly

258
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:44,836
Where did you run into our boy?

259
00:40:45,409 --> 00:40:49,436
How did you hook him?
Tell us

260
00:40:53,517 --> 00:40:55,883
"With folded hands,
greet all of them"

261
00:40:56,654 --> 00:40:59,316
Namaste.
- Namaste

262
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:08,664
"Enough, go on"

263
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:27,674
"Hurry, we have a long queue"

264
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:52,108
I liked draping a sari

265
00:42:40,457 --> 00:42:42,925
Your Ma is very nice

266
00:43:00,377 --> 00:43:03,642
You think this is India?
At the American immigration office...

267
00:43:03,981 --> 00:43:06,006
you try to bribe them
with 2000 dollars?

268
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:09,319
I thought it was time
they got used to taking bribes

269
00:43:09,653 --> 00:43:11,644
"Got used, my foot!"

270
00:43:11,989 --> 00:43:15,652
You're the one who ought to
get used to living in jail!

271
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:20,653
"Officer, here's 2000 Dollars"

272
00:43:23,667 --> 00:43:26,135
Know what? These guys don't know
the value of money

273
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:30,668
"Had it been India, I'd have brought
them along in just 2000 rupees"

274
00:43:31,008 --> 00:43:35,342
"You talk of bribes again...?
Thank God, brother had a reputation"

275
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:37,670
"Because of him, we got away"

276
00:43:38,015 --> 00:43:40,006
"Else, we'd have to spend
our lives in jail"

277
00:43:40,351 --> 00:43:44,082
"Because of you, I had to spend
a week in jail!"

278
00:43:44,421 --> 00:43:47,288
"What's the big deal? In India,
several leaders spend time in jail"

279
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:50,185
I'm going to kill you!

280
00:44:05,542 --> 00:44:09,308
Shekhar hasn't been going to the
restaurant for the last five days

281
00:44:12,449 --> 00:44:13,939
Where could they...

282
00:45:37,434 --> 00:45:39,425
"Kill him, Dadu... kill him!"

283
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:44,739
"Kill him, I say!
Hack him to pieces"

284
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:51,340
Dadu... hack him to pieces.
Kill him! Kill him!

285
00:46:04,862 --> 00:46:06,693
What's happening here...?

286
00:46:08,699 --> 00:46:11,497
Let him go... let go!

287
00:46:13,504 --> 00:46:17,702
"Uncle, ask them to let go.
Uncle..."

288
00:46:21,912 --> 00:46:27,373
Dadu... ask them to leave him alone.
Ask them to let Uncle go

289
00:46:27,718 --> 00:46:31,381
They're going to kill him!
Ask them to let him go

290
00:46:31,722 --> 00:46:35,920
Dadu... how long will we
continue with this bloodshed...?

291
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:41,960
"What good is bloodshed, Dadu?
Stop them, Dadu... stop them!"

292
00:46:42,432 --> 00:46:47,734
"Come, Dadu... ask them to let him go!
Tell them to let him go!"

293
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:50,663
Tell her...

294
00:46:54,845 --> 00:46:58,906
He didn't let the matrimonial
vermillion remain on my daughter

295
00:46:59,416 --> 00:47:01,350
He lobbed a grenade

296
00:47:02,753 --> 00:47:06,086
Your brother-in-law was
blown to pieces

297
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:08,685
It happened in front of your eyes.
Have you forgotten?

298
00:47:11,461 --> 00:47:16,364
"Someone came carrying his head,
someone else bore a limb..."

299
00:47:18,702 --> 00:47:20,693
is he going to return?

300
00:47:24,274 --> 00:47:28,267
"I'm even willing to worship this man,
but will my son-in-law come back?"

301
00:47:28,712 --> 00:47:32,705
"Forget the past, Dadu.
- My father ought to have killed him"

302
00:47:33,717 --> 00:47:36,413
But they treat the old man like putty

303
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:41,514
The old man shits and pees in his bed

304
00:47:42,426 --> 00:47:44,917
"So who will do the old man's job,
if not his son?"

305
00:47:47,331 --> 00:47:50,664
Nobody's going to gain
anything out of this. Nobody

306
00:47:51,835 --> 00:47:54,668
"Let him go, Dadu...
please let him go"

307
00:47:55,672 --> 00:47:59,665
My wise son...
let me tell you something

308
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:06,008
Had this man slaughtered your son
and your wife...

309
00:48:06,350 --> 00:48:08,818
would you still ask me
to let him go?

310
00:48:13,423 --> 00:48:16,017
I'd have let him go...
I wouldn't kill anyone

311
00:48:17,461 --> 00:48:20,362
You're an ass. A bloody ass

312
00:48:21,865 --> 00:48:24,857
"If I let him go,
he's going to kill me"

313
00:48:25,836 --> 00:48:29,863
Man does not kill man
because it's a blessing

314
00:48:30,607 --> 00:48:33,872
He kills to save his own skin

315
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:38,104
"But why would you bother,
even if I died?"

316
00:48:38,448 --> 00:48:40,439
You give a damn for your father anyway

317
00:48:41,718 --> 00:48:44,186
You didn't miss your father
even once in eight years

318
00:48:44,521 --> 00:48:48,890
"But the moment you heard about
your mother, you came running"

319
00:48:49,793 --> 00:48:53,991
You're right. I had left this hell

320
00:48:54,665 --> 00:48:59,466
But you're still leading the life
of a monster. A beast!

321
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:03,469
You don't have a shred of
humanity running in your veins

322
00:49:04,675 --> 00:49:09,669
"If you kill him today, his son
will kill you and me tomorrow"

323
00:49:10,681 --> 00:49:13,479
Blood and revenge...
for generations to come!

324
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:18,854
"What will you gain out
of this, Dadu? What?"

325
00:49:21,692 --> 00:49:24,786
How many more women will
weep like my sister?

326
00:49:25,696 --> 00:49:27,823
How many more lives
is it going to ruin?

327
00:49:29,399 --> 00:49:32,027
For how long are they
going to live in terror?

328
00:49:32,569 --> 00:49:36,505
"I beg of you, Dadu...
let him go! Leave him alone!"

329
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:40,833
"All right, I'll let him go.
I'll leave him alone"

330
00:49:41,712 --> 00:49:46,376
But we'll have to flee this place.
Like docile women...

331
00:49:46,717 --> 00:49:49,982
and where will we go?
To your madam's land?

332
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:57,658
"40 villages, 400 families
and the estates..."

333
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:05,659
I shoulder all the responsibility.
I keep their kitchen fires going

334
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:10,064
And where will they go?
He'll raze them to ashes

335
00:50:10,407 --> 00:50:13,672
Do what you want to!
- He'll raze them to ashes

336
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:20,348
He'll turn the place into a graveyard.
Women will cultivate their bodies...

337
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:27,351
and be enslaved to men.
And dogs will pee on our family name!

338
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:32,355
"All right, do whatever you wish.
But I'm going to have uncle released!"

339
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:35,028
Let him go! Let go!

340
00:50:35,465 --> 00:50:37,695
Take him away

341
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:41,694
Kick him out

342
00:50:44,574 --> 00:50:48,772
"Dadu, you'll have to regret this!
Kill him today..."

343
00:50:49,112 --> 00:50:55,017
"and his men will kill you tomorrow,
they will kill me. Let him go!"

344
00:50:55,519 --> 00:51:01,014
"Kick him out. Looks like I've
sired a pig, not a son"

345
00:51:25,482 --> 00:51:27,416
"Raja, go inside"

346
00:51:29,686 --> 00:51:35,682
"Have some peanuts, city boy.
- Take him inside, Nandini"

347
00:52:42,626 --> 00:52:45,356
We've killed your assassin

348
00:54:19,222 --> 00:54:21,656
The drum-beat...

349
00:54:40,377 --> 00:54:44,677
The drum-beat...

350
00:54:45,682 --> 00:54:47,673
the drum-beat resonates

351
00:54:52,188 --> 00:54:55,680
"You and I dance...
we sway"

352
00:55:05,502 --> 00:55:07,367
Under the gleaming swords...

353
00:55:07,704 --> 00:55:09,695
the anklets chime

354
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:19,710
The drum-beat...

355
00:55:54,384 --> 00:56:01,290
"This soil we love...
we are proud of it"

356
00:56:05,929 --> 00:56:11,697
"We're the stirring winds
that will uproot the enemy"

357
00:56:17,507 --> 00:56:19,702
We stand like the tall mountains

358
00:56:21,411 --> 00:56:24,710
"In his shadow, we live"

359
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:31,479
He has a heart as vast as the ocean

360
00:56:32,756 --> 00:56:36,317
We worship fire

361
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:46,301
"Under the gleaming swords
the anklets chime"

362
00:58:17,393 --> 00:58:24,231
You are our lord and master

363
00:58:24,767 --> 00:58:26,701
We adore you

364
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:35,710
"Taking lives is nothing...
we can even lay down our lives"

365
00:58:40,216 --> 00:58:42,411
The soil of your feet...

366
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:48,020
"is worthy of being
applied to our foreheads"

367
00:58:51,961 --> 00:58:54,657
Beholding you is like...

368
00:58:55,999 --> 00:58:59,799
"being granted a visitation
by the Lord"

369
00:59:03,473 --> 00:59:05,998
The drum beats...

370
00:59:26,696 --> 00:59:29,688
"You and I dance...
we sway"

371
00:59:39,876 --> 00:59:42,367
Under the gleaming swords...

372
00:59:42,712 --> 00:59:44,873
the anklets chime

373
00:59:52,155 --> 00:59:54,453
The drum-beat...

374
01:01:14,904 --> 01:01:20,433
What airs! The young one
is really showing off

375
01:01:22,378 --> 01:01:24,471
Dancing like Madhuri Dixit

376
01:01:29,786 --> 01:01:31,686
What is it?

377
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:39,686
People say that a murder...

378
01:01:41,931 --> 01:01:45,162
"No, I know there couldn't
have been a murder here"

379
01:01:45,501 --> 01:01:48,629
"But I'm in the police department.
I'll have to do my duty, you see"

380
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:54,107
But nothing has happened here.
Had there been something...

381
01:01:54,444 --> 01:01:56,435
"I'd surely have
got to know, isn't it?"

382
01:02:08,791 --> 01:02:11,658
Go away... get lost

383
01:02:31,414 --> 01:02:36,681
The water here doesn't suit Raja.
He's had a cough for two days...

384
01:02:37,386 --> 01:02:39,217
he has a fever too

385
01:02:42,692 --> 01:02:45,024
I'm not being able to
talk to uncle either

386
01:02:45,695 --> 01:02:47,959
The telephone lines here
are so bad

387
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:58,968
We'll come again to meet Ma

388
01:03:03,913 --> 01:03:05,904
That's what I've been
thinking about too

389
01:03:07,650 --> 01:03:10,744
I'll tell Ma tomorrow
that we're leaving

390
01:03:15,658 --> 01:03:17,649
"Sit down, son. You sit down too"

391
01:03:18,661 --> 01:03:20,652
Take the measurements

392
01:03:22,665 --> 01:03:26,999
What are you doing?
- Just stand here

393
01:03:27,670 --> 01:03:28,659
21...

394
01:03:30,673 --> 01:03:31,662
22...

395
01:03:34,377 --> 01:03:36,140
35...
- What is this?

396
01:03:37,847 --> 01:03:42,250
30...? Your tummy's all dried up.
Don't you get food to eat out there?

397
01:03:43,686 --> 01:03:45,677
Turn around now.
21...

398
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:52,626
Don't behave like a girl.
Give her the measurements

399
01:03:53,496 --> 01:03:57,296
"What's going on, Ma?
- Mind the measurements, tailor"

400
01:03:57,633 --> 01:04:01,296
Won't I have him hacked
if he messes up?

401
01:04:01,637 --> 01:04:05,630
"It's got to be as good as
the ones from the city, okay?"

402
01:04:07,643 --> 01:04:09,634
"What's all this about, Ma?
- Don't you remember?"

403
01:04:09,979 --> 01:04:14,848
"Four days later is your birthday.
- Oh, Ma! I forgot"

404
01:04:15,785 --> 01:04:19,778
You don't even remember your Ma.
You've forgotten everything

405
01:04:20,423 --> 01:04:22,653
But I remember.
- Which is why you're my Ma

406
01:04:28,364 --> 01:04:33,165
"Lovely bangles you're wearing, Ma!
Nandini, aren't they beautiful?"

407
01:04:33,669 --> 01:04:37,662
Tell me what you want to.
Don't flatter me

408
01:04:41,444 --> 01:04:44,436
"Ma, we want to go back tomorrow"

409
01:04:47,683 --> 01:04:54,350
Raja hasn't been keeping well.
The water here doesn't suit him...

410
01:04:55,491 --> 01:04:59,689
"and Nandini's scared too.
I'd have stayed over, but..."

411
01:05:05,701 --> 01:05:10,365
"Have a word with Dadu.
He'll flare up, if I say something"

412
01:05:12,408 --> 01:05:15,036
Only you can get us
the permission to leave

413
01:05:21,717 --> 01:05:27,849
"You understand what I say, don't you?
- I understand everything"

414
01:05:28,724 --> 01:05:30,715
You just don't want to live here

415
01:05:33,629 --> 01:05:37,861
But you've only left home...
you haven't left my heart

416
01:05:39,669 --> 01:05:43,036
But a mother will always
want to see her son

417
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:52,472
"After all those prayers and oaths,
those temples and medicines..."

418
01:05:53,182 --> 01:05:56,481
you were born to me
like a boon

419
01:05:57,753 --> 01:06:03,692
But look at my misfortune.
You can't live with your mother

420
01:06:08,364 --> 01:06:12,858
It's ages since I cooked
porridge on your birthday

421
01:06:14,170 --> 01:06:17,697
"Let me have the satisfaction
at least this time, my son"

422
01:06:18,708 --> 01:06:24,010
"For your Ma's sake, please stay on
for just four days"

423
01:06:24,714 --> 01:06:26,511
I beg you

424
01:06:27,783 --> 01:06:32,049
"You will stay, won't you?
You will stay...?"

425
01:06:34,423 --> 01:06:35,412
"Yes, Ma"

426
01:06:48,437 --> 01:06:49,426
Welcome!

427
01:06:50,673 --> 01:06:53,665
You've put on a lot of weight

428
01:07:04,587 --> 01:07:06,817
"Well, ass?
Where have you been?"

429
01:07:07,723 --> 01:07:12,023
"After the elections,
you just vanished"

430
01:07:16,732 --> 01:07:20,361
You did them all in?
You made a lot of money?

431
01:07:21,404 --> 01:07:25,704
"And you forgot, you used to make
bombs in this very house"

432
01:07:27,777 --> 01:07:32,180
I helped him fight the elections.
And as soon as he becomes a minister...

433
01:07:32,515 --> 01:07:34,915
his backside gets as big as a melon

434
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:47,663
"There are no roads in the village,
no water, no hospitals..."

435
01:07:49,198 --> 01:07:51,996
but he enjoys his chicken
in the hotels

436
01:07:52,668 --> 01:07:57,662
He has his booze and
strips young girls

437
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:10,676
But that's how politics is.
It makes a dog out of man

438
01:08:14,824 --> 01:08:18,021
And it gives power to a dog...
like him

439
01:08:22,698 --> 01:08:25,690
"You've ruled enough, ass.
I'll fight the elections now"

440
01:08:30,706 --> 01:08:36,508
Why're you staring at me? I'm not
making my wife the Chief Minister

441
01:08:39,715 --> 01:08:44,379
So what if I'm illiterate
and have a foul tongue...?

442
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:47,211
"As long as I wield the stick,
I am the legislator here"

443
01:08:52,528 --> 01:08:54,519
But you needn't worry.
I'll give you work...

444
01:08:54,864 --> 01:08:56,991
what is that?
- Polling agent

445
01:08:57,666 --> 01:08:59,793
You do recognise your worth

446
01:09:01,370 --> 01:09:04,669
Go away... the sight of you
makes my tiger cry. Go

447
01:09:13,582 --> 01:09:15,675
Look at the tiger in the nude!

448
01:09:34,270 --> 01:09:37,706
These politicians are
not to be trusted

449
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:42,170
They'd even sell their mothers

450
01:09:46,515 --> 01:09:48,449
So what's the plan? Tell me.

451
01:09:49,852 --> 01:09:53,652
I'll bring Narsimha
out of his house

452
01:09:54,390 --> 01:09:58,884
But killing him is your responsibility.
He mustn't escape

453
01:09:59,662 --> 01:10:01,994
I'm going to fight the
elections this time

454
01:10:02,731 --> 01:10:07,668
Tell me something... you have
the stomach to kill Narsimha?

455
01:10:12,408 --> 01:10:19,473
"Truth is that after my brother was
killed, my heart has been on fire"

456
01:10:20,716 --> 01:10:27,383
"For this very purpose, I have had
a gunman called from far away"

457
01:10:29,692 --> 01:10:35,358
He has committed three murders.
The first was his own father

458
01:10:35,698 --> 01:10:40,692
He ripped the old man apart
at a liquor den

459
01:10:41,704 --> 01:10:45,470
How many men have you killed?

460
01:10:48,410 --> 01:10:51,811
There's no count. None at all

461
01:10:52,514 --> 01:10:56,974
Just show him the money and
the way he kills... he's too much

462
01:10:59,655 --> 01:11:03,716
"Look, Mister...
don't go back on your word"

463
01:11:04,727 --> 01:11:09,357
"I want Narsimha dead, that's all.
You mustn't die instead"

464
01:11:10,666 --> 01:11:12,657
You mustn't die

465
01:11:16,505 --> 01:11:22,375
"A tiger's grandson, after all.
Give me the lighter"

466
01:11:22,845 --> 01:11:24,836
Nothing's going to happen.
Hold this

467
01:11:26,382 --> 01:11:30,682
Light it up and blow 'em up

468
01:11:32,454 --> 01:11:36,356
How's he going to rule the world
if he doesn't hurl grenades?

469
01:11:40,095 --> 01:11:45,863
This one didn't even explode.
Are you guys making bombs or sweets?

470
01:11:47,336 --> 01:11:51,636
"If this one doesn't explode,
you guys are going to face the music"

471
01:11:52,441 --> 01:11:56,639
"Step aside... step aside, I say.
- Come to me"

472
01:11:58,847 --> 01:12:01,975
Wasn't that an explosion!

473
01:12:04,019 --> 01:12:06,749
Let go...
- Let him be

474
01:12:07,156 --> 01:12:09,147
How will he manage
if he doesn't learn?

475
01:12:12,361 --> 01:12:16,058
Why're you hitting the child?
- Who the hell are you to ask me?

476
01:12:16,398 --> 01:12:17,387
Go away

477
01:12:18,667 --> 01:12:21,329
What sort of a man are you to
give explosives to a child?

478
01:12:21,670 --> 01:12:25,071
The skies haven't fallen
if we blew up a bomb

479
01:12:25,407 --> 01:12:28,001
You ought to be ashamed! If the
bomb had gone off in his hands...

480
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:31,074
he could have lost a limb...
anything could have happened

481
01:12:31,413 --> 01:12:35,679
This child is no bomb
you can replace with another

482
01:12:36,685 --> 01:12:40,849
What madam...? Do you eat fodder
to act like an animal?

483
01:12:45,694 --> 01:12:50,358
You give him a bomb?
Don't you have any brains?

484
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:58,306
He's your son's son!
Don't you understand that much?

485
01:12:58,774 --> 01:13:01,709
You're an animal anyway.
You want to make my son like you?

486
01:13:02,044 --> 01:13:03,909
"I made a mistake, so forgive me..."

487
01:13:06,382 --> 01:13:09,408
Let me and my son be.
Leave us alone

488
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:13,979
What's happening in
this hell-hole?

489
01:13:14,656 --> 01:13:20,652
"You lied that you had no one,
but this animal...?"

490
01:13:21,363 --> 01:13:24,332
They're all your flesh and blood.
- Let's go inside and talk

491
01:13:24,666 --> 01:13:26,657
I find it so suffocating here

492
01:13:34,376 --> 01:13:38,335
"The three of us. Let's go, please!
- But what is the matter?"

493
01:13:38,881 --> 01:13:43,079
What is the matter? He was
teaching Raja to burst a grenade

494
01:13:46,688 --> 01:13:53,287
"You're proud of him, aren't you?
But he's a beast! A wild animal!"

495
01:13:53,896 --> 01:13:57,297
"He applies the holy mark on his
forehead, he cuts up a goat..."

496
01:13:57,633 --> 01:14:00,295
and he turns your sister
into a widow!

497
01:14:00,636 --> 01:14:02,968
He broke her bangles and
he sent that man's head rolling...

498
01:14:05,407 --> 01:14:07,398
He's a killer.
A bloody killer!

499
01:14:29,965 --> 01:14:34,231
Why must you put up with it? Take your
wife and get the hell out of here

500
01:14:34,770 --> 01:14:38,467
"Idiot, it's my birthday
on the fifth"

501
01:14:39,675 --> 01:14:43,042
And you know my mother. She starts
crying the moment I talk about leaving

502
01:14:43,378 --> 01:14:47,337
Won't I have to stay till my birthday?
So keep your advise to yourself...

503
01:14:47,683 --> 01:14:52,120
and do something for me. Book three
tickets to Canada for the 6th

504
01:14:53,589 --> 01:14:56,023
Here are the passports.
- I'll do it right today

505
01:14:57,693 --> 01:15:02,926
Here's the money. Nobody must
get to know about this

506
01:15:04,533 --> 01:15:07,593
"No, I'm not going to the Collector"

507
01:15:07,936 --> 01:15:10,700
I barged into the Chief Minister's
bungalow yesterday...

508
01:15:11,039 --> 01:15:14,031
and said I'd resign if there was
no development in your area

509
01:15:14,409 --> 01:15:20,370
"He immediately rang up the Collector
and said threateningly, if there..."

510
01:15:20,716 --> 01:15:26,052
"is no development in Dadu's area, you
will regret where you are transferred"

511
01:15:29,725 --> 01:15:34,389
"Dadu, the Collector panicked.
He wants to meet you right now"

512
01:15:34,730 --> 01:15:39,861
Take off your spectacles...
are you shy to show me your eyes?

513
01:15:41,336 --> 01:15:43,395
You want me to go and
meet the Collector?

514
01:15:43,839 --> 01:15:47,798
I carry a dozen collectors
in my pocket

515
01:15:49,678 --> 01:15:51,475
What an ass!
Where are you sending him?

516
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:55,116
Kali Ghadi. Maharaj's men
go hunting there

517
01:15:55,450 --> 01:15:59,250
We'll bump off a few oldies there.
- Shut up

518
01:15:59,721 --> 01:16:02,087
"You ought to go and meet him, Dadu"

519
01:16:02,424 --> 01:16:05,086
Here's the chance to have some
development in this region

520
01:16:05,427 --> 01:16:09,693
"It has to do with 40,000 people.
It could benefit everyone"

521
01:16:10,165 --> 01:16:12,497
At least meet the Collector

522
01:16:13,769 --> 01:16:17,034
I'm an illiterate man...
not me

523
01:16:17,873 --> 01:16:20,501
"Dadu, you must fight
the elections"

524
01:16:20,809 --> 01:16:23,710
"Once you've won, you can do
anything for this area"

525
01:16:24,046 --> 01:16:27,709
But you'll have to meet the Collector
and other officials to do that

526
01:16:28,717 --> 01:16:33,177
Know what? I'll go and meet the
Collector and bring him here

527
01:16:33,522 --> 01:16:36,116
"Once you've met him, you won't
have anymore hesitation"

528
01:16:36,525 --> 01:16:39,392
So what if you're illiterate?
I'm an educated man

529
01:16:39,728 --> 01:16:42,856
Who will do the father's job
if not his son?

530
01:16:47,669 --> 01:16:49,660
It would be better if you came

531
01:16:50,439 --> 01:16:52,168
One of you go with him

532
01:16:52,474 --> 01:16:54,465
It's the first time he's
standing in for his father

533
01:16:57,412 --> 01:16:58,401
Nothing... go on

534
01:16:58,947 --> 01:17:01,541
Get the car out.
Hurry up

535
01:17:01,883 --> 01:17:03,282
You come along too

536
01:17:04,353 --> 01:17:06,014
What're you looking there for?
Come on

537
01:17:06,355 --> 01:17:08,687
"One minute, uncle..."

538
01:17:18,367 --> 01:17:20,358
He's making signs to his wife!

539
01:17:44,726 --> 01:17:46,990
You must take care of Dadu
during the elections

540
01:17:47,396 --> 01:17:50,331
"If he wins, it'll improve the lot
of the people in the region..."

541
01:17:50,666 --> 01:17:55,126
and your lot too.
And stop all that blood-letting

542
01:17:55,470 --> 01:17:59,338
Or you'll get killed some day.
And what happens of your loved ones?

543
01:17:59,675 --> 01:18:02,974
Don't you guys know what suffering
a fatherless child goes through?

544
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:06,671
We ought to get together
and make Dadu see reason

545
01:18:07,015 --> 01:18:08,846
I'm going to meet Uncle Maharaj...
- No

546
01:18:09,184 --> 01:18:12,347
I surely will. And reason with him
to help Dadu in the elections...

547
01:18:12,688 --> 01:18:15,179
here's the opportunity
to bury the hatchet

548
01:18:15,524 --> 01:18:17,685
Right?
- Stop the car!

549
01:18:22,264 --> 01:18:23,253
What happened?

550
01:22:36,753 --> 01:22:39,620
You know how he was killed sir

551
01:22:51,401 --> 01:22:53,665
"How did this happen, Dadu?"

552
01:22:56,072 --> 01:22:58,666
Who committed the murder?
- I don't know

553
01:23:00,076 --> 01:23:02,237
"The police won't be able to do
anything, if you don't tell us"

554
01:23:02,412 --> 01:23:04,744
Don't do anything then.
Just go away

555
01:23:05,181 --> 01:23:07,342
The post-mortem...

556
01:23:11,087 --> 01:23:13,817
Get the hell out of here!
Get lost!

557
01:23:42,385 --> 01:23:44,046
"Raja, wake up"

558
01:23:49,259 --> 01:23:51,454
Let's go... we're leaving

559
01:23:56,366 --> 01:24:02,066
Where are we going?
- Home. We're going home

560
01:24:02,472 --> 01:24:04,406
Where is Papa?

561
01:24:23,126 --> 01:24:27,358
What are you doing? His body's
lying here and you're leaving?

562
01:24:32,468 --> 01:24:36,029
Let my son's last rites
be performed by his son

563
01:24:36,606 --> 01:24:39,040
Or his soul will never find peace

564
01:24:41,110 --> 01:24:45,843
I beg you... please don't go away

565
01:24:47,050 --> 01:24:49,041
Please don't go away

566
01:25:02,065 --> 01:25:05,398
"Papa, get up"

567
01:25:11,074 --> 01:25:13,008
"Papa, wake up"

568
01:25:42,038 --> 01:25:46,372
You are destined to have a void...

569
01:25:47,377 --> 01:25:52,041
"in the skies,
is your abode"

570
01:25:52,682 --> 01:25:57,449
"Loneliness is your
only companion..."

571
01:25:58,054 --> 01:26:02,855
and this is your last journey

572
01:26:06,062 --> 01:26:10,863
Away from the land of misery...

573
01:26:11,401 --> 01:26:15,997
away from cries of agony...

574
01:26:16,906 --> 01:26:21,343
away from the oceons of hatred...

575
01:26:22,245 --> 01:26:26,011
Away from the fire...

576
01:26:27,050 --> 01:26:31,419
that sets hearts ablaze

577
01:26:32,522 --> 01:26:36,424
Away from the fire...

578
01:27:33,049 --> 01:27:35,415
Where is your husband?

579
01:27:44,026 --> 01:27:46,017
I'm not sparing him

580
01:27:51,033 --> 01:27:56,027
His grown up son is dead.
Narsimha's beside himself in agony

581
01:27:56,439 --> 01:27:59,374
He's hopping mad
in his mansion
