There are dragons everywhere, how come?

198
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:53,170
Because the Emperor belongs
to the Dragon Clan.

199
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:56,750
Its believed that his ancestors are blessed
with a power

200

This is his father.

214
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:34,550
This is the MahaYang Dragon...

What?

219
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,920
Yes, on Kia's first birthday

220
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,880
a miracle occurred in the sky.

221
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:51,050
The MahaYang Dragon himself
descended down upon us.

222
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,750
The Protector of China, the fire-wielding one.

Everyone got an opportunity to see.
The MahaYang Dragon.

224
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:05,868
There was a bright ball of Divine Fireball
on his chest...

225
00:19:06,348 --> 00:19:08,798
...and his entire body was glowing brightly.

226
00:19:17,216 --> 00:19:18,750
He blessed Kia

227
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,210
with a special protective symbol.

228
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,630
Since then everyone believes

229
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,840
that Kia shares a special bond with the dragon.

230
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:38,340
Such miracles happen only once
in a hundred years.

231

That's why Kia is the Light of China.

What's happening here?

1101
01:41:52,150 --> 01:41:53,920
Everyone get on the dragon.

1102
01:42:06,830 --> 01:42:09,090
Let us also jump on the dragon!

1103
01:42:15,330 --> 01:42:16,500
No!

1104
01:42:53,600 --> 01:42:57,670
Today is the day of happiness and
celebration for our kingdom.

1105
01:42:57,910 --> 01:43:01,980
Our beloved Princess Kia is in our amidst

1106
01:43:06,010 --> 01:43:08,890
The reward for bringing Kia back safely...

1107
01:43:09,090 --> 01:43:11,390
goes to these brave children.

1108
01:43:12,780 --> 01:43:13,990
Laddoo Warrior...

1109
01:43:16,650 --> 01:43:18,780
I will be eternally grateful to you.

1110
01:43:18,990 --> 01:43:22,310
Your Highness, I just did what
any friend would've done.

1111
01:43:22,730 --> 01:43:27,890
Bheem, you've proven you're the only
one who deserves the Dragon Trophy.

1112
01:43:28,210 --> 01:43:32,750
That is not it. Half the
treasure is rewarded to the kids.

1113
01:43:37,590 --> 01:43:38,960
Thank you, My Lord.

1114
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,710
We cannot accept this reward.

1115
01:43:42,130 --> 01:43:44,880
But I will accept the Dragon Trophy.

1116
01:43:45,230 --> 01:43:47,430
This belongs to you, Bheem.

1117
01:43:54,090 --> 01:43:58,110
Bheem, it is my wish
that you spend a few days with us

1118
01:43:58,400 --> 01:44:00,090
in the Royal Palace.

1119
01:44:00,290 --> 01:44:03,700
If you agree to do that
it will please me immensely.

1120
01:44:04,370 --> 01:44:06,230
I certainly agree, Your Highness.

1121
01:44:06,470 --> 01:44:07,990
I'll be happy to stay.

1122
01:44:09,210 --> 01:44:12,330
Let's do it! Let's have a party.

1123
01:44:22,500 --> 01:44:29,000
Bheem will have a bang
Kung Fu Dhamaka!

1124
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:46,420
He pounces like a tiger

1125
01:44:46,480 --> 01:44:49,850
You better don't mess with him

1126
01:44:49,930 --> 01:44:52,840
Size doesn't matter with him

1127
01:44:53,300 --> 01:44:55,760
He fights the mightiest

1128
01:44:56,670 --> 01:45:00,130
Bheem will eat a
laddoo and have a bang

1129
01:45:00,170 --> 01:45:03,050
Hell of a bang!

1130
01:45:03,630 --> 01:45:06,500
Kung Fu Dhamaka!

1131
01:45:07,050 --> 01:45:09,920
Kung Fu Dhamaka!

1132
01:45:24,170 --> 01:45:27,170
He uses every opportunity in his favor

1133
01:45:27,630 --> 01:45:30,880
Bheem always remains undefeated

1134
01:45:34,500 --> 01:45:37,800
Dholakpur Team is unparalleled

1135
01:45:37,880 --> 01:45:40,880
They are friends are for life

1136
01:45:41,250 --> 01:45:45,500
Bheem will eat a laddoo and have a bang

1137
01:45:45,630 --> 01:45:48,500
Hell of a bang!

1138
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,920
Kung Fu Dhamaka!

1139
01:45:52,460 --> 01:45:55,340
Kung Fu Dhamaka!

1140
01:46:09,590 --> 01:46:12,920
No matter how high the mountain

1141
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:16,420
River flow cuts right through it

1142
01:46:19,880 --> 01:46:22,920
A life of fear is calls for defeat

1143
01:46:23,300 --> 01:46:26,210
A life of strong will calls for victory

1144
01:46:26,710 --> 01:46:30,960
Bheem will eat a laddoo and have a bang

1145
01:46:31,050 --> 01:46:33,880
Hell of a bang!

1146
01:46:34,460 --> 01:46:37,340
Kung Fu Dhamaka!

1147
01:46:37,880 --> 01:46:40,840
Kung Fu Dhamaka!

1148
01:46:41,300 --> 01:46:44,670
He pounces like a tiger

1149
01:46:44,710 --> 01:46:48,050
You better don't mess with him

1150
01:46:48,170 --> 01:46:50,670
Size doesn't matter with him

1151
01:46:51,630 --> 01:46:54,090
He fights the mightiest

1152
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:59,300
Bheem will eat a laddoo and have a bang

1153
01:46:59,340 --> 01:47:02,170
Hell of a bang!

1154
01:47:02,750 --> 01:47:05,630

Kung Fu Dhamaka!

1156
01:47:09,590 --> 01:47:16,500
Bheem will have a bang
Kung Fu Dhamaka!
