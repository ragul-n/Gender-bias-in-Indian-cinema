1
00:00:49,791 --> 00:00:51,958
<i>I am ready to do a suicide attack.</i>

2
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:57,291
My father also lost his life
while performing a suicide attack.

3
00:00:57,875 --> 00:01:00,875
I have a brother, but he is scared.

4
00:01:01,458 --> 00:01:03,958
I am not sad about doing this!

5
00:01:05,916 --> 00:01:08,500
I must press this button,
not the other one.

6
00:01:08,583 --> 00:01:10,541
My last wish

7
00:01:10,625 --> 00:01:13,208
is for my brother to follow the same path.

8
00:01:13,916 --> 00:01:16,000
He must choose jihad.

9
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:28,041
-Go!
-Come on!

10
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:39,083
-Kick it!
-Take it from him!

11
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:26,625
They ran away!

12
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:29,791
Let's go.

13
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
<i>I will just do it.</i>

14
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:22,166
{\an8}-Hey! Don't shoot!
-Don't shoot!

15
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,333
{\an8}-He's just a kid.
-Chocolate?

16
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:25,875
Baaz!

17
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:29,583
Baaz!

18
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:35,250
-No!
-Go! Leave for now!

19
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:42,041
Time is a great healer.

20
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:43,875
Go. Go now.

21
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:53,416
-Stay away!
-Stay away!

22
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,833
Allah is the greatest.

23
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:57,333
-This woman is a suicide bomber!
-It's an ambush!

24
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:40,708
NO ONE IS WORTHY OF WORSHIP EXCEPT ALLAH
AND MOHAMMAD IS HIS MESSENGER

25
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:44,916
<i>Greetings. May the peace, mercy,
and blessings of Allah be with you.</i>

26
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:47,541
<i>I am Abdullah Qazar.</i>

27
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:53,375
<i>I am the commander of the area
from Kunnar to Nooristan.</i>

28
00:05:56,708 --> 00:06:02,958
Be it Russians or Americans,
everyone has been scared of this region.

29
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:05,500
{\an8}To destroy this region means

30
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:07,958
{\an8}to conquer Afghanistan.

31
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:11,500
These westerners
are scared of us, Talibans.

32
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:16,291
{\an8}We will destroy them here
at their military post

33
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,291
{\an8}and then defeat them in Kabul too.

34
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:22,958
{\an8}<i>All these outsiders</i>

35
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:26,041
{\an8}<i>are here to rule us.</i>

36
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:30,833
<i>The Afghans and other countries</i>

37
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:34,083
<i>that support these western forces
are also our enemies.</i>

38
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:36,000
They are our targets.

39
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:41,833
{\an8}Good evening, sir.

40
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:44,791
{\an8}We have confirmed intel on Qazar.

41
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:49,708
{\an8}The Taliban leader is in this village.

42
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:54,041
{\an8}The entire area below the entry point
to Khost is a Taliban stronghold.

43
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:56,333
{\an8}We should bomb the village.

44
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:00,208
{\an8}Sir, our people…

45
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,333
{\an8}Sir, we have our people
residing in that area.

46
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:24,916
{\an8}<i>These outsiders are demons,
not human beings.</i>

47
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:28,375
{\an8}<i>Infidels!</i>

48
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:33,750
{\an8}<i>Every Afghan is their enemy.</i>

49
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:37,625
{\an8}Nooristan and Kabul
are the slaughterhouses of Americans.

50
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:43,666
{\an8}We will kill them at their own
military bases.

51
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:51,541
{\an8}Come on all. Get them!

52
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:52,625
{\an8}Get here.

53
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:53,958
{\an8}Swear to god!

54
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:57,875
{\an8}We will achieve this by making
our children suicide bombers.

55
00:07:58,875 --> 00:07:59,875
{\an8}Take out the gun.

56
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:10,916
{\an8}Shut up or I will kill you.

57
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:33,000
{\an8}Yes, I am just looking for him.

58
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:37,458
Excuse me, sir. Are you Mr. Nasser Khan?

59
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:43,416
Excuse me, sir.

60
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:45,583
Are you Mr. Nasser Khan?

61
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:47,458
Are you all right?

62
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:51,000
It is the last call for boarding.
Please come for boarding.

63
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,333
I've lost my boarding card.

64
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:42,416
{\an8}Hello, my friend! Welcome.

65
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,666
Long time no see.

66
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:46,791
Thank you for coming.

67
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:49,958
I know it was difficult for you. Thanks.

68
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:54,500
Sorry, I didn't reply
to your emails and phone calls.

69
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:56,291
I know. I can understand.

70
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:59,500
I was sure you would come.

71
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:01,083
So, I never gave up hope.

72
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:03,500
-He's Abdullah.
-Greetings, sir.

73
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:05,333
He'll drop you off at the guest house.

74
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:17,458
<i>Sir, do you like shawarma and falafel?</i>

75
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:20,083
You will not get them here anymore.

76
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:23,958
Noor-e-labab,
the Lebanese restaurant, was destroyed.

77
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:25,541
<i>Shalimar is gone too.</i>

78
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:28,458
<i>They made delicious biryani.</i>

79
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:31,875
<i>Almost 54 died.</i>

80
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:35,166
<i>The French restaurant,
Le Jardin, was destroyed too.</i>

81
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,708
<i>But only 12 got killed there.</i>

82
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:40,208
<i>How many died in the Lebanese restaurant?</i>

83
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:42,625
-Not many. Just five…
-Stop the car.

84
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:05,583
Did you call me?

85
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:09,500
Five died in the Lebanese restaurant.

86
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:13,250
-And 12 in Le Jardin.
-Yes.

87
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:14,750
Why?

88
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:18,625
People keep dying here and there.
It's normal, sir!

89
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:46,875
Sadiq, what's going on there?

90
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:50,208
Are reporters here for interviews?

91
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:51,333
Forget that!

92
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:55,708
Those three boys
from the Pakistani refugee camp

93
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:58,666
have a real cricket ball.

94
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,541
The one professionals use.

95
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:02,958
Really? A real cricket ball from Pakistan!

96
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:06,708
-Let me see the ball.
-Please show it to me.

97
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:08,250
Please let me see it.

98
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:11,333
Please ask him to show it.
We're not going to eat it up.

99
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:12,625
Show it.

100
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:15,291
Hey! Show us the ball, Baaz!

101
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:16,541
Did you steal it?

102
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:20,583
It's only been two days since you arrived
and you're already stealing things!

103
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:25,625
You want to play with it,

104
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:29,083
don't you?

105
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:32,625
Hey.

106
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:36,458
I lost my red ball
near the American compound.

107
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,666
Gulab, they stole it!

108
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:42,375
What are you saying?
We got it from Pakistan.

109
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:46,000
Look at it from a distance.

110
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:48,708
It is a real one.

111
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:51,833
Afridi has used it.

112
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:54,708
He took six wickets with it.

113
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:56,958
How did you get Afridi's ball?

114
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:59,750
We got it from the match venue.

115
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:02,791
We used to watch many matches in Pakistan.

116
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:05,250
We met all the cricket players there.

117
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,458
We met Virat Kohli too.

118
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:08,458
Liar!

119
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:09,625
They are liars!

120
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:12,708
I swear! We have met all the players.

121
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:14,666
All the cricket teams visit Pakistan,

122
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,625
but they never come here.

123
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:18,583
They are scared of bomb blasts.

124
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:27,875
Who is the leader here?

125
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,000
Gulab-ud-din.

126
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:32,333
Gulab-ud-din.

127
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:35,250
This ball belongs to me now.

128
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:39,875
-No, Baaz. Don't!
-No, Baaz!

129
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:45,083
Son of a bitch! Motherfucker!

130
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:53,916
Run!

131
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:59,750
-Did you get it?
-You idiot!

132
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:01,833
What are you looking at me for? Catch him!

133
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:08,291
Come on, Baaz!

134
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:10,041
We have won it!

135
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,708
Oh, god!

136
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:21,250
Oh, god!

137
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:24,458
Gulab,

138
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:27,375
I suggest you resolve the matter.

139
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:29,708
Talk it out.

140
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:31,583
The ball is ours.

141
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,375
Get a bat if you want to play.

142
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:39,791
A real bat for a real ball.
What do you say, Baaz?

143
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,541
Okay.

144
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:44,750
-Ali Sher.
-Yes?

145
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:46,208
You get the bat

146
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:47,791
from your father's factory.

147
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:50,750
Let's go.

148
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:55,291
Gulab.

149
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:57,541
He is the Talib

150
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,041
who came from Pakistan last month.

151
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,708
His mother was a suicide bomber!

152
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:17,791
Thank you.

153
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:26,833
<i>What do the children of Afghanistan need?</i>

154
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:28,541
-Education.
-Etiquette.

155
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:30,625
-Food.
-Peace.

156
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:32,208
Peace.

157
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:35,916
<i>Fulfilling their dreams
is Tomorrow's Hope's dream.</i>

158
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:40,166
<i>So join us in giving these people
a ray of hope.</i>

159
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:52,541
Greetings.

160
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:55,000
In Dari we say, this is your home.

161
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:58,416
We have been experiencing this
destruction for the past 30 years.

162
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:02,666
My father had sent me off to the USA
when the Russians attacked.

163
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:06,000
While studying there,
I had just one dream.

164
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:09,583
To come back here and work for my people.

165
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:14,791
But when I came back,
the situation had worsened.

166
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:18,583
Right then, I met Meera.

167
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:21,291
She gave me courage and faith.

168
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:27,125
Tomorrow's Hope.

169
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:31,750
It is now home to about
a thousand children and their families.

170
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:37,583
Meera's husband,
Dr. Nasser Khan is here today.

171
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,583
I would like to call him on the stage.

172
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:06,625
FREEDOM

173
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:14,625
Photo?

174
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:36,708
GOD DO NOT LIKE JOBLESS PEOPLE

175
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:04,291
<i>Sir, please don't roam around like this.</i>

176
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:06,583
<i>These days they are targeting Indians too.</i>

177
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:18,666
I've survived for five years, Ayesha.

178
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:20,750
Times have changed.

179
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:23,541
So did my outlook and feelings.

180
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:29,000
I know you want to help me
but those children's faces…

181
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:37,333
Ayesha, some things in life
cannot be forgiven.

182
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:40,666
Nasser, everyone needs a purpose.

183
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:44,958
It was Meera's purpose in life
to help these people.

184
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:47,916
Aren't you proud of her?

185
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:53,166
Please visit the refugee camp
before you leave.

186
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:56,750
Her dream
has given many people a new life.

187
00:20:58,541 --> 00:20:59,875
Please, Nasser.

188
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:03,416
I'm leaving the day after.

189
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:30,833
Abdullah!

190
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:33,916
- Abdullah!
-Yes, sir? What happened?

191
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,458
Where did this come from?

192
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:38,250
A man had come to meet you.
He left it here.

193
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:41,000
He wanted to see you.
I said you're sleeping.

194
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:43,250
-Should I call him now?
-No.

195
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,583
Good morning, sir.

196
00:21:48,666 --> 00:21:50,750
Please sit. Let me get you some tea.

197
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:09,958
Oh, no!

198
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:17,208
You broke it again!

199
00:22:18,041 --> 00:22:20,583
There is nothing left to break
in this house anymore.

200
00:22:20,666 --> 00:22:22,333
-Give it to me.
-No.

201
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:25,291
-I will break this bat!
-Wait.

202
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,666
Don't vent it out on the bat!

203
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:32,000
I got it for him. It has the signatures
of all his favorite players.

204
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:35,250
It has Dhoni's, Malinga's, and Sehwag's.

205
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:36,333
Do whatever you wish!

206
00:22:36,416 --> 00:22:38,500
Let him destroy
the entire house. I don't care.

207
00:22:39,916 --> 00:22:41,583
I've received the official letter.

208
00:22:42,833 --> 00:22:45,208
I am being posted at the embassy in Kabul.

209
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:47,416
I have to leave next Sunday.

210
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,166
Nasser, I am missing my work.

211
00:22:49,666 --> 00:22:52,333
Afghanistan has always been on my mind.

212
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:55,625
I have always wanted
to do something for the children of war!

213
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:58,583
I will open an NGO there.

214
00:22:58,666 --> 00:23:01,458
I'll serve the crisis-afflicted people.

215
00:23:05,791 --> 00:23:07,125
Tea for you, sir.

216
00:23:25,083 --> 00:23:27,083
Bravo, Baaz!

217
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,333
Come on! Bowl him out.

218
00:23:31,458 --> 00:23:33,333
-Come on! Bowl him out!
-Bravo!

219
00:23:33,416 --> 00:23:34,833
-Bravo!
-Take his wicket.

220
00:23:35,791 --> 00:23:36,708
Bravo, Baaz!

221
00:23:39,291 --> 00:23:41,375
Catch it.

222
00:23:41,458 --> 00:23:45,666
-Come on. Throw it!
-How sloppy!

223
00:23:49,375 --> 00:23:52,375
-Bravo, Baaz! Dismiss him!
-Good bowling, Baaz!

224
00:23:52,458 --> 00:23:54,833
-Pitch it at a good length.
-Dismiss him!

225
00:23:54,916 --> 00:23:56,166
-Go back a little.
-Bravo!

226
00:23:57,541 --> 00:23:59,333
-Bravo!
-Well done!

227
00:23:59,416 --> 00:24:00,666
Come on, Baaz!

228
00:24:04,083 --> 00:24:06,375
Nasser, we run classes here.

229
00:24:06,458 --> 00:24:08,250
Two shifts every day for the children.

230
00:24:08,333 --> 00:24:11,333
So everyone can attend
at their convenience.

231
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:14,916
The tent there is a distribution center.

232
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,958
That one is the medical clinic.

233
00:24:17,458 --> 00:24:19,166
The entire refugee camp

234
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:22,375
-has been adopted by Tomorrow's Hope.
-Ayesha.

235
00:24:22,458 --> 00:24:24,750
-Yes?
-We need to talk. It is urgent.

236
00:24:24,833 --> 00:24:26,291
Nasser, I will be back.

237
00:25:10,625 --> 00:25:13,333
Bravo, Baaz! Bravo!

238
00:25:14,541 --> 00:25:15,500
Come on!

239
00:25:22,791 --> 00:25:23,958
Come on!

240
00:25:26,083 --> 00:25:28,208
-Catch it!
-It's in the air!

241
00:25:35,791 --> 00:25:37,416
Hey, throw back the ball!

242
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,833
Hey, give it!

243
00:25:39,958 --> 00:25:41,041
Give the ball back.

244
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:42,708
Can't you hear me?

245
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:44,708
Gulab, he is not giving the ball back.

246
00:25:44,791 --> 00:25:46,625
-Go there and ask him.
-All right.

247
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,625
Give back our ball!

248
00:25:51,708 --> 00:25:53,791
It's a dangerous match.

249
00:25:53,875 --> 00:25:55,208
We are all in a bad mood!

250
00:26:11,708 --> 00:26:13,958
Gulab, he is not returning the ball.

251
00:26:15,791 --> 00:26:17,625
Hey, crazy man! Give our ball back.

252
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,083
-Hey, run!
-Get it.

253
00:26:28,208 --> 00:26:29,666
Gulab, he threw our ball!

254
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:31,583
Hey!

255
00:26:38,458 --> 00:26:40,208
He is here again!

256
00:26:40,708 --> 00:26:42,750
Why are you back here?

257
00:26:43,916 --> 00:26:44,916
Search him.

258
00:26:45,458 --> 00:26:47,000
Why do you come every day?

259
00:26:47,083 --> 00:26:48,541
-Come out.
-Why did you come?

260
00:26:48,625 --> 00:26:49,666
-Come out.
-Wait.

261
00:26:50,458 --> 00:26:51,291
Get aside.

262
00:26:55,791 --> 00:26:57,041
Why are you here?

263
00:26:59,208 --> 00:27:01,416
This is all I have of him…

264
00:27:22,083 --> 00:27:23,416
Niaz!

265
00:27:28,958 --> 00:27:30,208
Nice.

266
00:27:31,125 --> 00:27:32,250
Let's go there.

267
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:34,375
Is it here?

268
00:27:39,458 --> 00:27:40,625
Niaz!

269
00:27:41,541 --> 00:27:42,791
Niaz!

270
00:27:43,708 --> 00:27:44,875
Aryan!

271
00:28:01,083 --> 00:28:02,375
Come here quickly. Hurry up!

272
00:28:09,541 --> 00:28:10,708
Allah!

273
00:28:11,333 --> 00:28:13,958
Allah!

274
00:28:24,833 --> 00:28:26,416
This is painful!

275
00:28:26,916 --> 00:28:28,458
Take another boy.

276
00:28:46,333 --> 00:28:48,083
He is not breathing.

277
00:30:16,625 --> 00:30:19,833
NATO retaliated against the Taliban attack
by bombing our village.

278
00:30:21,916 --> 00:30:22,916
My family

279
00:30:23,666 --> 00:30:26,166
and my house were destroyed.

280
00:30:27,333 --> 00:30:29,500
I didn't even realize

281
00:30:29,583 --> 00:30:31,333
when somebody poisoned

282
00:30:31,416 --> 00:30:33,791
his innocent mind!

283
00:30:34,875 --> 00:30:36,375
Niaz would often say that Aryan

284
00:30:37,166 --> 00:30:38,875
resembled his younger brother.

285
00:30:39,958 --> 00:30:41,541
He loved him dearly.

286
00:30:42,125 --> 00:30:43,375
A lot.

287
00:30:44,083 --> 00:30:45,208
Please forgive me!

288
00:30:46,166 --> 00:30:48,083
Please forgive my Niaz.

289
00:30:52,708 --> 00:30:54,583
Your son, Niaz, was a good boy.

290
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:58,791
May Allah bless us
with a kind and patient heart.

291
00:31:27,333 --> 00:31:33,083
<i>Why so much hatred?</i>

292
00:31:34,541 --> 00:31:40,500
<i>What’s wrong with your beings?</i>

293
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,500
<i>Torn from their branches</i>

294
00:31:45,083 --> 00:31:48,333
<i>They are trampled in dirt</i>

295
00:31:48,416 --> 00:31:53,750
<i>Have mercy on these innocent flowers</i>

296
00:31:55,166 --> 00:31:57,875
<i>Oh, Lord!</i>

297
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:01,291
<i>Oh, Lord!</i>

298
00:32:01,375 --> 00:32:03,416
<i>Oh, Lord!</i>

299
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:09,416
<i>Have mercy</i>

300
00:32:27,333 --> 00:32:29,416
-Abdullah, shift it a little.
-Sure.

301
00:32:30,166 --> 00:32:31,541
Shift it.

302
00:32:31,625 --> 00:32:33,208
To the left. Move it.

303
00:32:35,708 --> 00:32:38,083
Keep it straight.

304
00:32:38,166 --> 00:32:39,375
Shift.

305
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:41,083
Put it there to the left.

306
00:32:42,583 --> 00:32:44,375
-Make it straight.
-Nasser.

307
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,125
Thank God, I thought you left.

308
00:32:48,708 --> 00:32:50,000
How could I?

309
00:32:50,625 --> 00:32:52,333
The office needs to be set up.

310
00:32:52,416 --> 00:32:53,458
Ayesha.

311
00:32:53,958 --> 00:32:56,208
People say militants

312
00:32:56,291 --> 00:32:59,708
are scared
of American air and drone attacks.

313
00:32:59,791 --> 00:33:00,750
But no.

314
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:06,208
You are doing something
that's scaring them!

315
00:33:07,666 --> 00:33:08,875
I am with you.

316
00:33:09,666 --> 00:33:10,875
You're mad!

317
00:33:10,958 --> 00:33:14,000
May I get a job at Tomorrow's Hope?

318
00:33:14,083 --> 00:33:15,541
I am a qualified doctor.

319
00:33:40,041 --> 00:33:42,375
Why don't you play football with them?

320
00:33:43,625 --> 00:33:46,041
I can't kick the ball hard.

321
00:33:46,125 --> 00:33:48,000
But I am good at cricket.

322
00:33:53,708 --> 00:33:55,666
I am a cricket-lover too.

323
00:33:56,166 --> 00:33:58,708
-We will play together one day. Okay?
-Okay.

324
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:06,000
<i>Yes, Afghanistan
is going to create history</i>

325
00:34:06,083 --> 00:34:08,916
<i>if they can beat
former champions like Sri Lanka,</i>

326
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,833
<i>West Indies, Pakistan, and India.</i>

327
00:34:10,916 --> 00:34:11,750
{\an8}<i>What do you say?</i>

328
00:34:12,708 --> 00:34:14,250
Bless you. God bless you, kids.

329
00:34:15,583 --> 00:34:17,333
Bless you.

330
00:34:19,083 --> 00:34:21,333
Consider this your own home. Sit down.

331
00:34:21,833 --> 00:34:22,750
Here.

332
00:34:22,833 --> 00:34:23,750
Yes!

333
00:34:25,166 --> 00:34:26,875
What a shot!

334
00:34:29,083 --> 00:34:30,208
Come.

335
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:44,583
-Bravo! What a shot!
-Amazing.

336
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:46,625
<i>Afghanistan cricket team's victory</i>

337
00:34:46,708 --> 00:34:49,750
<i>has kindled hope and happiness
among the locals.</i>

338
00:34:50,458 --> 00:34:53,250
This is a proud moment
for the entire nation.

339
00:34:55,541 --> 00:34:57,833
<i>More problems in the world
should be solved</i>

340
00:34:57,916 --> 00:35:00,541
by playing cricket matches
instead of fighting wars.

341
00:35:00,625 --> 00:35:04,291
Before the match, the Taliban spokesperson
called up the cricket board

342
00:35:04,375 --> 00:35:06,625
<i>and wished good luck to the team</i>

343
00:35:06,708 --> 00:35:07,916
-Hip hip…
-…hooray!

344
00:35:36,958 --> 00:35:38,375
Gulab.

345
00:35:38,458 --> 00:35:39,750
He's the same guy

346
00:35:39,833 --> 00:35:41,541
who had thrown our ball away!

347
00:35:42,333 --> 00:35:44,625
I know he is eyeing our playground.

348
00:35:45,291 --> 00:35:47,000
He got his team along today.

349
00:35:47,083 --> 00:35:48,291
Mr. Nasser.

350
00:35:48,375 --> 00:35:49,208
Hey.

351
00:35:50,583 --> 00:35:51,791
Amazing!

352
00:35:52,375 --> 00:35:54,416
Where have you brought us
to play the match?

353
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:58,625
Playing in the open is more fun.

354
00:35:58,708 --> 00:36:00,458
-Hi, Bill.
-Hi, there.

355
00:36:00,958 --> 00:36:03,000
-Let's go and play. Are you ready?
-Yes.

356
00:36:03,083 --> 00:36:03,958
-Come on.
-Let's go!

357
00:36:13,875 --> 00:36:15,291
<i>Listen, Baaz.</i>

358
00:36:16,666 --> 00:36:19,833
Listen, Baaz.
A lot of Americans and outsiders

359
00:36:19,916 --> 00:36:23,041
have come to our camp.

360
00:36:23,541 --> 00:36:25,708
They are playing cricket at our ground.

361
00:36:25,791 --> 00:36:28,750
Ball, bat, and pad.

362
00:36:28,833 --> 00:36:30,333
They have everything.

363
00:36:30,416 --> 00:36:33,291
And the one you wear
inside your underwear for protection.

364
00:36:33,375 --> 00:36:36,375
They have a real leather ball.

365
00:36:36,458 --> 00:36:38,250
I love it.

366
00:36:38,333 --> 00:36:40,375
I love their bat more.

367
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:43,083
If I get it,

368
00:36:43,833 --> 00:36:45,500
I can become a great batsman!

369
00:36:47,583 --> 00:36:50,041
-Hey!
-Come on, Bill!

370
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:52,541
Such awful players!

371
00:36:52,625 --> 00:36:54,875
We play without shoes and gear,

372
00:36:54,958 --> 00:36:56,541
and we are still better than them.

373
00:36:59,291 --> 00:37:00,416
Throw the ball!

374
00:37:01,416 --> 00:37:02,458
Catch it.

375
00:37:02,541 --> 00:37:04,541
-Throw it!
-Out! Yes!

376
00:37:06,083 --> 00:37:09,125
-Yes!
-Well done!

377
00:37:09,208 --> 00:37:11,500
Gulab, ask them if we can play.

378
00:37:12,458 --> 00:37:13,625
Come on!

379
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:18,666
<i>Howzat!</i>

380
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:21,083
This side…

381
00:37:21,166 --> 00:37:23,125
Ask him. Go.

382
00:37:23,208 --> 00:37:24,375
<i>Howzat!</i>

383
00:37:24,458 --> 00:37:25,666
Why didn't you?

384
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:27,958
-You should have asked.
-Go, ask him.

385
00:37:28,041 --> 00:37:29,750
-Sir!
-Hey!

386
00:37:34,916 --> 00:37:35,750
Come on.

387
00:37:35,833 --> 00:37:39,250
It's your face! He didn't even hear you.

388
00:37:39,333 --> 00:37:41,083
-Pitch the ball.
-Yes.

389
00:37:41,166 --> 00:37:42,458
Yes.

390
00:37:42,541 --> 00:37:44,250
-Bravo! Very good!
-A six!

391
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:47,333
-Nasser.
-Come on.

392
00:37:47,416 --> 00:37:48,333
Run.

393
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:49,875
It was a good game!

394
00:37:49,958 --> 00:37:50,958
<i>It was fun!</i>

395
00:37:51,666 --> 00:37:54,583
Will they play every day, Gulab?

396
00:37:57,833 --> 00:37:59,250
-Sadiq.
-Yes?

397
00:37:59,333 --> 00:38:01,375
-Will they let us play today?
-God knows.

398
00:38:01,458 --> 00:38:02,750
Should we ask?

399
00:38:04,541 --> 00:38:06,750
It was a high one.

400
00:38:07,541 --> 00:38:08,833
Let Abdullah bowl.

401
00:38:08,916 --> 00:38:10,041
Greetings.

402
00:38:10,708 --> 00:38:11,541
Greetings.

403
00:38:11,625 --> 00:38:14,250
Sir, take us on the team.

404
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:15,708
It is our ground.

405
00:38:16,791 --> 00:38:19,083
It's public ground. Anyone can play here.

406
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:23,291
Go sit over there.

407
00:38:23,375 --> 00:38:25,208
Go on.

408
00:38:30,208 --> 00:38:32,583
Dear God! He hits a six every time!

409
00:38:33,458 --> 00:38:35,041
Hey, motherfucker!

410
00:38:35,125 --> 00:38:36,500
Hey, motherfucker!

411
00:38:37,458 --> 00:38:39,000
He called you.

412
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:41,625
Hey, kid! Don't say that.

413
00:38:44,583 --> 00:38:45,458
Come here.

414
00:38:47,166 --> 00:38:48,666
-Do you all want to play?
-Yes.

415
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:50,041
-Do you?
-Yes.

416
00:38:50,125 --> 00:38:51,208
Go there.

417
00:38:51,291 --> 00:38:52,833
-Hooray!
-Go on.

418
00:38:58,416 --> 00:38:59,750
Come on.

419
00:39:01,125 --> 00:39:02,166
What's your name?

420
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:03,333
Gulab.

421
00:39:03,875 --> 00:39:05,750
-Will you bowl?
-Sure.

422
00:39:08,708 --> 00:39:10,625
-Come on, pal!
-Hey!

423
00:39:11,333 --> 00:39:12,958
Come, if you want to play.

424
00:39:13,041 --> 00:39:13,958
What?

425
00:39:14,541 --> 00:39:16,791
We don't want to play with you guys!

426
00:39:21,333 --> 00:39:23,208
Sir, let me bowl as well!

427
00:39:23,291 --> 00:39:24,833
-Do you want to?
-Yes.

428
00:39:24,916 --> 00:39:26,083
Give him the ball.

429
00:39:34,833 --> 00:39:37,166
Come on, let's go. This is rubbish!

430
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:38,291
Let's go.

431
00:39:38,375 --> 00:39:41,166
He is bowling really well.
Come on, Fareed, hit it.

432
00:39:43,416 --> 00:39:45,125
Let's play, Baaz.

433
00:39:45,208 --> 00:39:47,000
No, we won't. Come.

434
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,708
Hey, you!

435
00:40:00,833 --> 00:40:02,083
Come hurry up!

436
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:15,166
We trained them in Pakistan.

437
00:40:17,041 --> 00:40:21,208
You have to find these boys for us.

438
00:40:21,791 --> 00:40:23,833
Our camp was attacked
by the American forces,

439
00:40:24,458 --> 00:40:28,250
the families of these boys took
this chance and brought them here.

440
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:29,958
We know

441
00:40:30,875 --> 00:40:33,916
they are hiding in the refugee camps here.

442
00:40:35,625 --> 00:40:39,500
They are our soldiers.

443
00:40:41,666 --> 00:40:43,833
Our own people should help us!

444
00:40:45,875 --> 00:40:47,833
It is your duty

445
00:40:48,416 --> 00:40:53,250
towards your country,
your faith, and your people.

446
00:40:53,333 --> 00:40:56,583
Allah does not approve of your ways.

447
00:40:57,541 --> 00:40:59,083
These are children.

448
00:40:59,833 --> 00:41:02,750
You are misusing the name jihad,
the holy fight against evil.

449
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:07,875
Jihad is sanctified
to protect the innocent and weak.

450
00:41:08,958 --> 00:41:11,041
I cannot commit such a sin.

451
00:41:14,583 --> 00:41:16,583
The holy command is only for those

452
00:41:16,666 --> 00:41:20,833
who carry faith to follow through!

453
00:41:26,958 --> 00:41:28,458
Allah, please,

454
00:41:28,541 --> 00:41:30,958
I said it for your sake.

455
00:41:31,041 --> 00:41:33,833
I said kind words.

456
00:41:37,958 --> 00:41:38,833
Children.

457
00:41:39,958 --> 00:41:42,666
Today, you don't have
to target the blocks.

458
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,083
Shoot here.

459
00:41:44,875 --> 00:41:45,875
Shoot on the head!

460
00:41:48,083 --> 00:41:49,041
Shut up!

461
00:41:49,875 --> 00:41:50,916
One!

462
00:41:53,083 --> 00:41:54,375
Two!

463
00:41:59,125 --> 00:42:00,208
Three!

464
00:42:18,125 --> 00:42:20,250
Some special <i>kahwah</i> for you.

465
00:42:21,166 --> 00:42:22,208
Afghani <i>kahwah.</i>

466
00:42:22,291 --> 00:42:26,083
Afghani <i>kahwah</i> and Afghani cricket team

467
00:42:26,166 --> 00:42:28,250
are both incomparable.

468
00:42:28,333 --> 00:42:32,041
India, Pakistan and all other teams
are nothing in front of Afghanistan!

469
00:42:32,875 --> 00:42:36,791
I mean, the Indian team is good.
But no one else can do that.

470
00:42:38,833 --> 00:42:40,458
A six!

471
00:42:46,958 --> 00:42:49,625
<i>I have seen courage in their hearts</i>

472
00:42:50,333 --> 00:42:51,916
and dreams in their eyes.

473
00:42:53,833 --> 00:42:55,666
They are looking for a chance.

474
00:42:56,333 --> 00:42:59,166
I want to start a cricket training camp

475
00:42:59,791 --> 00:43:02,791
for children of the refugee camp.

476
00:43:03,458 --> 00:43:05,041
They will be trained

477
00:43:05,125 --> 00:43:08,333
and readied for selection.

478
00:43:08,958 --> 00:43:12,166
Good players will be admitted
to the Kabul Cricket Club.

479
00:43:14,833 --> 00:43:18,166
With God's grace,

480
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:21,041
they may even get to play
in the national team someday.

481
00:43:23,958 --> 00:43:25,708
They are orphans,

482
00:43:26,375 --> 00:43:27,500
homeless,

483
00:43:28,375 --> 00:43:29,625
and have lost everything!

484
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:33,333
Nobody helped them. So what?

485
00:43:35,375 --> 00:43:36,541
The dreams are ours,

486
00:43:37,333 --> 00:43:39,208
the efforts should also be ours.

487
00:43:41,125 --> 00:43:42,791
Despite such odds,

488
00:43:43,458 --> 00:43:44,958
you are standing tall.

489
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:50,708
I've also lost my dear ones here.

490
00:43:52,416 --> 00:43:53,291
Come.

491
00:43:54,333 --> 00:43:56,000
Let's make a new beginning together.

492
00:44:03,958 --> 00:44:05,166
So, tell me…

493
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:07,666
Who is a good batsman?

494
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:09,416
-It's me!
-I can!

495
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:11,333
-Me!
-Me!

496
00:44:13,083 --> 00:44:14,000
Bowler?

497
00:44:14,083 --> 00:44:15,875
-Me!
-Me!

498
00:44:15,958 --> 00:44:17,541
Gulab is the best batsman!

499
00:44:17,625 --> 00:44:19,458
But Ali Sher bowled him out.

500
00:44:19,541 --> 00:44:21,666
He is a great spinner.

501
00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:23,208
Dear, God!

502
00:44:23,291 --> 00:44:25,541
They are already fighting.

503
00:44:25,625 --> 00:44:27,625
You handle them now.

504
00:44:28,458 --> 00:44:30,375
Baaz or I will be the captain.

505
00:44:30,458 --> 00:44:31,666
Come here, Baaz.

506
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:33,375
Hey, are you crazy?

507
00:44:33,458 --> 00:44:34,583
He is talking nonsense!

508
00:44:34,666 --> 00:44:37,708
There is no better player
than Gulab in this refugee camp.

509
00:44:37,791 --> 00:44:39,250
There is. Baaz is better.

510
00:44:39,333 --> 00:44:40,333
Baaz!

511
00:44:41,875 --> 00:44:44,666
This Talib doesn't have
the courage to fight me.

512
00:44:46,125 --> 00:44:47,750
He is a Talib!

513
00:44:50,041 --> 00:44:51,500
A Taliban supporter!

514
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:54,416
He says Taliban
want progress for our country.

515
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:56,666
If you kill the infidel,
you'll go to heaven.

516
00:44:56,750 --> 00:44:59,916
The Americans make our own
Afghan army fight against the Taliban.

517
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,625
They make Afghans fight each other.

518
00:45:02,333 --> 00:45:05,541
Son of a bitch!
What are you telling him? Talk to me!

519
00:45:05,625 --> 00:45:08,958
You're the son of a Talibani.

520
00:45:09,041 --> 00:45:11,208
Your entire family was Talibani!

521
00:45:11,291 --> 00:45:12,916
Your father, uncle…

522
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,375
And your father!

523
00:45:14,458 --> 00:45:16,000
He was a coward. A traitor.

524
00:45:16,833 --> 00:45:18,666
He was a policeman.

525
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:20,500
The Taliban killed him.

526
00:45:21,583 --> 00:45:23,541
I'll grow up to be an army captain

527
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:26,708
and kill Talibanis like you.

528
00:45:27,291 --> 00:45:29,583
I will grow up to be a Taliban.

529
00:45:30,625 --> 00:45:34,083
And kill cowards and traitors like you.

530
00:45:37,166 --> 00:45:40,625
His mother was also a Taliban
supporter. She was a murderer.

531
00:45:42,125 --> 00:45:43,416
A holy warrior

532
00:45:44,083 --> 00:45:45,250
not a murderer.

533
00:45:45,333 --> 00:45:46,875
She is a martyr!

534
00:45:50,416 --> 00:45:51,375
Come on.

535
00:45:51,458 --> 00:45:53,458
Hey, stop! Where are you going?

536
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:10,541
<i>We are ready to fight!</i>

537
00:46:11,375 --> 00:46:13,250
<i>A holy warrior is not afraid of anybody!</i>

538
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,708
I have my parents' permission.

539
00:46:16,708 --> 00:46:18,250
I will cut the enemy's throat.

540
00:46:18,333 --> 00:46:19,875
Allah is with us.

541
00:46:20,708 --> 00:46:22,291
My blood is raging.

542
00:46:22,375 --> 00:46:25,000
I will tear the enemy apart

543
00:46:25,875 --> 00:46:28,666
with a bomb

544
00:46:29,583 --> 00:46:30,500
and with this knife!

545
00:46:32,666 --> 00:46:34,375
I have my parent's blessings!

546
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:38,125
I will cut their throats,
will attack every enemy,

547
00:46:39,125 --> 00:46:40,708
and destroy them.

548
00:46:43,375 --> 00:46:44,500
Baaz!

549
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:00,416
Baaz.

550
00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:02,333
Do you want a ride?

551
00:47:07,458 --> 00:47:08,416
Baaz.

552
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,250
Want a ride?

553
00:47:22,750 --> 00:47:23,791
Baaz.

554
00:47:25,333 --> 00:47:27,166
Stop. Baaz, stop.

555
00:47:33,166 --> 00:47:34,583
You do not like me.

556
00:47:36,541 --> 00:47:39,125
Outsiders are not to be trusted!

557
00:47:39,208 --> 00:47:42,166
Go back to where you came from.

558
00:47:42,958 --> 00:47:44,291
I am from India.

559
00:47:47,166 --> 00:47:51,250
I've heard you are a terrific player.

560
00:47:52,916 --> 00:47:56,208
A fast-bowler and a superb batsman.

561
00:47:57,125 --> 00:47:59,291
I've heard you used to be in the army.

562
00:48:00,208 --> 00:48:02,250
Yes, I was.

563
00:48:03,541 --> 00:48:04,666
I was a doctor.

564
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:08,208
I helped people and saved their lives.

565
00:48:08,291 --> 00:48:12,750
The world has its eyes fixed
on the Afghan team.

566
00:48:12,833 --> 00:48:15,375
Their victory has left everyone awestruck.

567
00:48:22,625 --> 00:48:25,541
I need a player like you.

568
00:48:26,166 --> 00:48:29,000
There is no better player
than Baaz in this camp.

569
00:48:29,083 --> 00:48:31,750
Even in Pakistan, he was the best.

570
00:48:31,833 --> 00:48:32,916
Shut up!

571
00:48:34,958 --> 00:48:36,958
Listen, come for the practice.

572
00:48:37,041 --> 00:48:38,791
You will go far.

573
00:48:42,125 --> 00:48:45,958
At least come and watch, okay?

574
00:48:46,958 --> 00:48:49,125
Hey, Baaz, it's 2 p.m. okay?

575
00:48:58,791 --> 00:49:00,375
It was a close save!

576
00:49:00,458 --> 00:49:02,416
He doesn't know how to hold a bat!

577
00:49:04,416 --> 00:49:06,375
Coach.

578
00:49:07,208 --> 00:49:11,625
What's all this? They are worthless!
We are the good players.

579
00:49:12,416 --> 00:49:14,208
Yes, Coach. Let us play.

580
00:49:14,291 --> 00:49:15,958
Don't waste our time!

581
00:49:16,041 --> 00:49:17,208
Shut up!

582
00:49:17,291 --> 00:49:18,583
Go, practice.

583
00:49:18,666 --> 00:49:20,583
Practice catching! Go!

584
00:49:21,583 --> 00:49:24,000
-Come on!
-They can't play!

585
00:49:24,083 --> 00:49:25,750
-Hit a six.
-Nasser…

586
00:49:25,833 --> 00:49:30,416
The boy from the Pakistani refugee camp
will be a good player.

587
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:32,416
These kids can't do it.

588
00:50:04,125 --> 00:50:07,000
I've told you repeatedly! Bat and pad.

589
00:50:07,083 --> 00:50:09,708
Keep the bat and pad aligned.

590
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:11,041
There shouldn't be any gap.

591
00:50:12,125 --> 00:50:15,375
Don't you get it? How will you play?

592
00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:20,500
-Play well, okay?
-Sure, Coach.

593
00:50:24,083 --> 00:50:25,500
He is dying to play.

594
00:50:26,333 --> 00:50:27,583
But such ego…

595
00:50:28,083 --> 00:50:30,250
They are Pashtuns.

596
00:50:30,333 --> 00:50:33,500
Win their heart
and they'll sacrifice their life for you.

597
00:50:33,583 --> 00:50:35,541
I don't want their life.

598
00:50:35,625 --> 00:50:37,333
I want to form a team.

599
00:50:39,416 --> 00:50:41,875
Very good!

600
00:50:41,958 --> 00:50:43,833
Gulab will be

601
00:50:43,916 --> 00:50:46,083
our opening batsman.

602
00:50:53,666 --> 00:50:54,875
Khosh Bakht!

603
00:50:54,958 --> 00:50:56,833
Give the ball back!

604
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,541
Stay.

605
00:50:59,625 --> 00:51:00,916
Let's see

606
00:51:01,458 --> 00:51:03,083
if he will pick up the ball.

607
00:51:12,458 --> 00:51:15,041
-Hey!
-Hey!

608
00:51:15,125 --> 00:51:17,000
Why did you throw away the ball?

609
00:51:17,083 --> 00:51:19,000
How dare you do that to Gulab?

610
00:51:20,125 --> 00:51:21,000
Hey, Talib!

611
00:51:21,083 --> 00:51:23,333
Looks like your time is over!

612
00:51:23,416 --> 00:51:26,458
Should I send you to hell
to be with your mother and father?

613
00:51:26,541 --> 00:51:28,541
Come here, you son of a bitch!

614
00:51:28,625 --> 00:51:31,083
I'll parade you naked.

615
00:51:31,958 --> 00:51:33,458
-Hey!
-Let me go.

616
00:51:33,541 --> 00:51:35,791
Calm down!

617
00:51:36,916 --> 00:51:38,916
Focus on the game!

618
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,250
Today is the last day for selection.

619
00:51:44,458 --> 00:51:47,541
Tomorrow, children from outside
will come and play with you.

620
00:51:48,875 --> 00:51:50,416
They are great players.

621
00:51:51,208 --> 00:51:52,375
Go practice!

622
00:51:53,708 --> 00:51:54,583
What?

623
00:52:21,583 --> 00:52:23,708
He's Wahid and he's Imlal.

624
00:52:24,833 --> 00:52:26,333
Very dangerous bowler!

625
00:52:27,250 --> 00:52:29,208
Lovely high-arm action.

626
00:52:30,291 --> 00:52:33,750
He is gifted with pace and aggression.

627
00:52:34,666 --> 00:52:36,000
Mind your head while playing!

628
00:52:37,291 --> 00:52:39,500
-What's this, Coach?
-What?

629
00:52:39,583 --> 00:52:42,541
They're Hazaras. We're Pathans. Pashtun.

630
00:52:42,625 --> 00:52:44,250
We can't play with them.

631
00:52:44,333 --> 00:52:45,625
Why not?

632
00:52:46,833 --> 00:52:47,958
They're players too.

633
00:52:48,541 --> 00:52:50,541
Gulab, you go and bat first!

634
00:52:51,541 --> 00:52:53,250
-Are you scared?
-Coach!

635
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:56,583
You're an outsider,

636
00:52:57,458 --> 00:52:59,833
you don't understand our culture.

637
00:52:59,916 --> 00:53:02,166
The Pashtuns and Hazaras are archenemies.

638
00:53:02,250 --> 00:53:05,291
We will not play with them.

639
00:53:05,375 --> 00:53:07,541
-Right, Khoda Baksh?
-Yes.

640
00:53:07,625 --> 00:53:09,000
I will not play either.

641
00:53:09,083 --> 00:53:11,166
-What do you say, Gulab?
-Yes.

642
00:53:11,250 --> 00:53:13,750
-Ali Sher?
-Yes. You're right.

643
00:53:13,833 --> 00:53:17,541
Coach, I told you,
they will not play with us.

644
00:53:18,333 --> 00:53:21,291
Bloody cowards! Shame on you!

645
00:53:21,375 --> 00:53:22,625
Hey, dimwit!

646
00:53:22,708 --> 00:53:24,666
Who are you calling a coward?

647
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:26,583
Go, bowl!

648
00:53:27,250 --> 00:53:28,833
-Sadiq, come on!
-Yes.

649
00:53:28,916 --> 00:53:30,958
Let's teach him a lesson.

650
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:33,333
Coach! Go sit there.

651
00:53:33,416 --> 00:53:34,625
Yes, sir.

652
00:53:40,083 --> 00:53:41,875
Hit it, Gulab!

653
00:53:42,375 --> 00:53:44,375
Aim for his face.

654
00:53:49,708 --> 00:53:51,791
-Come on, Gulab!
-Good job, Gulab!

655
00:53:51,875 --> 00:53:53,833
Do well, Imlal! Bravo!

656
00:54:00,375 --> 00:54:02,333
What a delivery!

657
00:54:04,541 --> 00:54:06,125
Good bowling.

658
00:54:07,458 --> 00:54:08,291
Yes.

659
00:54:08,375 --> 00:54:10,375
Come on, Gulab.

660
00:54:11,583 --> 00:54:13,666
-Gulab, hit his face.
-Yes.

661
00:54:20,666 --> 00:54:22,583
What happened, Hazara?

662
00:54:22,666 --> 00:54:24,416
You forgot how to bowl?

663
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:25,708
Loser!

664
00:54:36,833 --> 00:54:38,083
Hey!

665
00:54:38,166 --> 00:54:39,125
Are you all right?

666
00:54:39,708 --> 00:54:41,041
Hey! What did you do?

667
00:54:45,541 --> 00:54:47,250
Come on, Gulab. Get up!

668
00:54:52,083 --> 00:54:53,916
Hit his face, Gulab!

669
00:54:57,750 --> 00:54:58,750
Come on, Gulab!

670
00:54:58,833 --> 00:55:01,708
-Out!
-He's dismissed!

671
00:55:02,208 --> 00:55:03,458
What?

672
00:55:03,541 --> 00:55:05,166
Darn!

673
00:55:08,750 --> 00:55:10,916
Get lost now.

674
00:55:13,166 --> 00:55:16,041
Any other Pathan wants to play?

675
00:55:21,458 --> 00:55:22,583
Gulab.

676
00:55:25,458 --> 00:55:26,458
Him!

677
00:55:26,541 --> 00:55:27,625
Talib is here.

678
00:55:29,541 --> 00:55:31,750
He picked up the bat!

679
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:23,416
Wow!

680
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:26,500
Gulab, he lost the ball again!

681
00:56:26,583 --> 00:56:28,541
Stupid! He hit a sixer!

682
00:56:28,625 --> 00:56:31,041
-Wow!
-Amazing!

683
00:56:31,125 --> 00:56:34,125
Horray!

684
00:56:49,375 --> 00:56:50,583
Yes!

685
00:56:54,166 --> 00:56:56,625
-Baaz.
-Come here, Gulab and Baaz.

686
00:56:58,750 --> 00:56:59,750
Shake hands.

687
00:57:01,041 --> 00:57:02,125
Fuck you.

688
00:57:03,125 --> 00:57:05,125
Motherfucker!

689
00:57:05,208 --> 00:57:07,375
Hey. No need for such words, kid.

690
00:57:07,458 --> 00:57:08,625
Leave it.

691
00:57:09,333 --> 00:57:10,375
Leave it!

692
00:57:10,916 --> 00:57:13,833
Get lost now!

693
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,333
Yes!

694
00:57:19,375 --> 00:57:20,583
It's okay. Don't be sad!

695
00:57:26,041 --> 00:57:29,250
Baaz hit the shot, and the fielder missed.

696
00:57:29,333 --> 00:57:32,000
The ball crosses the rope!

697
00:57:35,625 --> 00:57:39,500
The next delivery. Baaz hits it again.

698
00:57:41,083 --> 00:57:42,458
What a shot!

699
00:57:45,583 --> 00:57:46,666
Can we talk?

700
00:57:47,708 --> 00:57:49,458
I will not join your team.

701
00:57:59,791 --> 00:58:01,041
He's my son, Aryan.

702
00:58:02,166 --> 00:58:04,083
He also loved cricket.

703
00:58:05,250 --> 00:58:06,750
He would be about your age now.

704
00:58:07,541 --> 00:58:09,500
Where's he? In India?

705
00:58:18,125 --> 00:58:19,250
Up there.

706
00:58:20,291 --> 00:58:21,583
With his mother.

707
00:58:23,375 --> 00:58:26,125
God is quick to call
the good ones up there.

708
00:58:28,208 --> 00:58:30,166
I haven't seen destruction like you.

709
00:58:32,833 --> 00:58:35,333
But I can understand
the pain of losing loved ones.

710
00:58:36,291 --> 00:58:38,750
This talent and this life

711
00:58:39,541 --> 00:58:40,541
that you have now,

712
00:58:41,958 --> 00:58:43,375
it's a gift from God.

713
00:58:44,750 --> 00:58:45,958
Don't throw it away!

714
00:58:49,250 --> 00:58:51,375
You are a good player.

715
01:00:02,083 --> 01:00:03,583
-Hey, here.
-Come on!

716
01:00:03,666 --> 01:00:05,208
Quiet!

717
01:00:05,291 --> 01:00:06,208
He's here.

718
01:00:08,958 --> 01:00:10,708
-Keep quiet!
-Hey!

719
01:00:14,291 --> 01:00:17,000
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

720
01:00:17,083 --> 01:00:18,708
-Hello.
-Hello.

721
01:00:18,791 --> 01:00:21,750
-We are strong.
-We are strong.

722
01:00:21,833 --> 01:00:24,583
I speak Pashto too.

723
01:00:24,666 --> 01:00:26,291
What's this, Coach?

724
01:00:27,083 --> 01:00:28,666
It's an oxygen mask. Here.

725
01:00:30,250 --> 01:00:34,541
I believe we can make a formidable team.

726
01:00:35,750 --> 01:00:38,958
And for that, we need
some more formidable players.

727
01:00:40,333 --> 01:00:43,833
People shouldn't say that
boys from refugee camps can't play.

728
01:00:44,375 --> 01:00:46,208
-Absolutely!
-Yes, sir.

729
01:00:46,291 --> 01:00:47,625
-Abdullah!
-Yes, sir?

730
01:00:51,375 --> 01:00:53,500
-Yes, sir.
-Imlal and Wahid.

731
01:00:53,583 --> 01:00:55,666
Imlal and Wahid.

732
01:00:55,750 --> 01:00:56,875
Come on.

733
01:00:58,625 --> 01:01:01,458
Wahid and Imlal will play for our team.

734
01:01:02,041 --> 01:01:02,875
Coach.

735
01:01:03,666 --> 01:01:05,416
Playing against them is fine.

736
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:07,708
But we can't play on the same team.

737
01:01:07,791 --> 01:01:10,625
Their stature is lower than us Pathans!

738
01:01:10,708 --> 01:01:12,958
-Coach I told you, they are vile!
-Hey!

739
01:01:13,041 --> 01:01:14,625
-Hey!
-Mind your tongue!

740
01:01:14,708 --> 01:01:17,708
-Hey!
-Calm down! Stop it!

741
01:01:18,625 --> 01:01:20,166
What nonsense is this?

742
01:01:20,875 --> 01:01:23,541
I want a good team. That's all!

743
01:01:23,625 --> 01:01:24,750
Coach.

744
01:01:25,333 --> 01:01:27,333
Your job is to train us!

745
01:01:27,416 --> 01:01:29,375
Don't meddle in our affairs

746
01:01:29,458 --> 01:01:33,083
-Okay?
-He's right. They can't play.

747
01:01:33,166 --> 01:01:34,333
Okay.

748
01:01:35,666 --> 01:01:37,041
So I am just a coach!

749
01:01:37,125 --> 01:01:39,083
Why should I waste my time on you then?

750
01:01:40,083 --> 01:01:41,875
-Let's go, Abdullah.
-Coach.

751
01:01:41,958 --> 01:01:43,166
Coach.

752
01:01:43,250 --> 01:01:44,833
-Coach!
-Coach!

753
01:01:46,208 --> 01:01:47,250
Coach!

754
01:02:11,875 --> 01:02:14,333
Gulab, let's practice by ourselves.

755
01:02:14,916 --> 01:02:17,000
Coach is upset.
I don't think he will come.

756
01:02:17,083 --> 01:02:18,916
You always talk crap, Sadiq!

757
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,375
Why did you say
such rude things in front of him?

758
01:02:21,458 --> 01:02:24,333
Why? You also didn't want
to play with the Hazaras.

759
01:02:36,041 --> 01:02:38,708
-Let us in.
-Let us in.

760
01:02:38,791 --> 01:02:40,958
-Let us in.
-Quiet!

761
01:02:41,041 --> 01:02:42,000
Kids!

762
01:02:42,083 --> 01:02:44,333
-Let us.
-What's this noise? No!

763
01:02:44,416 --> 01:02:48,416
-We want to meet the coach.
-There's no coach here.

764
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:51,375
-Coach!
-Stop them! Go away!

765
01:02:51,458 --> 01:02:53,250
-Coach!
-Stop them!

766
01:02:53,333 --> 01:02:54,416
{\an8}-Coach!
-Go away!

767
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:55,708
{\an8}What are you doing here?

768
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,541
Forgive us, Coach.
Fellow Afghans are brothers.

769
01:02:59,625 --> 01:03:00,750
Go away!

770
01:03:00,833 --> 01:03:02,333
You idiot! Shut up!

771
01:03:02,416 --> 01:03:06,958
-Pashtuns and Hazaras are brothers!
-We are all like brothers.

772
01:03:07,041 --> 01:03:09,416
-We are brothers.
-We are brothers.

773
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:12,875
-We are all like brothers.
-Pashtuns and Hazaras are brothers.

774
01:03:12,958 --> 01:03:15,708
Okay. Don't waste your time here.
Go, practice!

775
01:03:15,791 --> 01:03:17,875
-Tomorrow's the test.
-Yes. Let's go.

776
01:03:17,958 --> 01:03:19,958
-Come on.
-Let's go. Yes.

777
01:03:20,041 --> 01:03:21,791
-I'll bat.
-Come on.

778
01:03:30,666 --> 01:03:33,250
This boy doesn't leave my mind.

779
01:03:36,291 --> 01:03:37,291
He was so little

780
01:03:38,791 --> 01:03:42,708
when he saw his mother
make the ultimate sacrifice.

781
01:03:45,791 --> 01:03:47,833
Western powers should not forget

782
01:03:50,166 --> 01:03:52,708
that Afghanistan is the land of Allah.

783
01:03:54,083 --> 01:03:56,250
These children
are like fierce desert storms

784
01:03:56,916 --> 01:03:59,750
that will destroy the enemy.

785
01:04:00,791 --> 01:04:02,500
It's written on their faces

786
01:04:04,125 --> 01:04:06,875
that these falcons will rise again.

787
01:04:32,333 --> 01:04:34,250
In the name of Allah.

788
01:04:34,333 --> 01:04:36,208
-He is the greatest!
-He is the greatest!

789
01:04:37,166 --> 01:04:38,250
In the name of Allah.

790
01:04:38,333 --> 01:04:40,666
-He is the greatest!
-He is the greatest!

791
01:04:40,750 --> 01:04:42,666
In the name of Allah.

792
01:04:42,750 --> 01:04:45,875
-He is the greatest!
-He is the greatest!

793
01:04:51,458 --> 01:04:54,166
<i>I am a black falcon!</i>

794
01:04:55,416 --> 01:04:57,458
So am I!

795
01:05:29,625 --> 01:05:33,166
This machine will throw balls now?
What about bowlers then?

796
01:05:36,958 --> 01:05:38,083
Sir.

797
01:05:41,041 --> 01:05:43,750
Welcome. I am Shariyar Khan.

798
01:05:43,833 --> 01:05:45,208
-Greetings.
-The head coach,

799
01:05:45,958 --> 01:05:49,041
-Kabul Cricket Academy. Have a seat.
-Sure.

800
01:05:50,791 --> 01:05:53,875
-So you are from India, right?
-Yes.

801
01:05:53,958 --> 01:05:56,916
Tell me. What can I do for you?

802
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,875
The children from the refugee camp…

803
01:06:00,875 --> 01:06:03,583
They are really talented.

804
01:06:04,750 --> 01:06:07,416
They are good players,
not scared of losing.

805
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:10,291
They need to learn the techniques.

806
01:06:10,375 --> 01:06:13,083
I've disciplined them to an extent.

807
01:06:14,416 --> 01:06:17,916
I'd be thankful if you could coach them.

808
01:06:19,083 --> 01:06:22,291
Look, Mr. Nasser,

809
01:06:23,583 --> 01:06:24,958
I am a frank person.

810
01:06:25,041 --> 01:06:28,333
These children from the refugee camp,

811
01:06:28,416 --> 01:06:31,458
their mindset is not right.

812
01:06:32,083 --> 01:06:34,166
They grow up hearing

813
01:06:34,250 --> 01:06:36,833
if you do a suicide attack,
you'll be sent to heaven.

814
01:06:37,875 --> 01:06:41,625
You are wasting your time.

815
01:06:41,708 --> 01:06:44,958
Take my advice. Stay away from this mess!

816
01:06:45,958 --> 01:06:48,375
I'm a frank person too.

817
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:51,625
Let me be straight with you.

818
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:54,166
I will train these children

819
01:06:54,250 --> 01:06:56,375
and they will make
a great team, you'll see.

820
01:06:57,500 --> 01:06:59,166
Hey. I am sorry.

821
01:06:59,250 --> 01:07:01,666
Don't get upset.

822
01:07:01,750 --> 01:07:05,666
I am just trying to give you good advice.

823
01:07:07,791 --> 01:07:11,875
I can bet, one of these days

824
01:07:11,958 --> 01:07:16,875
one of the boys
will strap a bomb on his body

825
01:07:16,958 --> 01:07:20,000
and kill himself and many innocent people.

826
01:07:21,083 --> 01:07:22,166
Mr. Shariyar,

827
01:07:23,208 --> 01:07:25,083
let's make this bet.

828
01:07:26,208 --> 01:07:28,583
My team will play against your team.

829
01:07:28,666 --> 01:07:32,791
If we defeat your under-16 team,

830
01:07:33,666 --> 01:07:37,750
you'll train them at your academy.

831
01:07:37,833 --> 01:07:39,416
If we lose,

832
01:07:40,041 --> 01:07:42,958
I'll pay you 4,000 dollars.

833
01:07:44,041 --> 01:07:45,666
Challenge accepted, Mr. Nasser!

834
01:07:46,708 --> 01:07:48,125
I'll see you on the field.

835
01:08:11,791 --> 01:08:14,125
-Greetings.
-Greetings.

836
01:08:14,208 --> 01:08:16,375
-Greetings.
-Greetings.

837
01:08:16,458 --> 01:08:17,666
Listen up.

838
01:08:18,708 --> 01:08:22,416
-He's Harpal, sir. I call him Billu.
-Billu.

839
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:26,208
He will coach you from now on.

840
01:08:26,916 --> 01:08:29,375
-Greetings, Coach.
-Greetings.

841
01:08:29,458 --> 01:08:31,541
-Are you Pashtun?
-Yes.

842
01:08:31,625 --> 01:08:34,208
A Punjabi Pakhtun! Go run six laps! Go!

843
01:08:34,291 --> 01:08:36,583
-Run! Come on!
-Start!

844
01:08:37,625 --> 01:08:40,125
Sir, Afghanistan?

845
01:08:40,208 --> 01:08:43,125
It is a dangerous place!
Why are you doing this?

846
01:08:43,208 --> 01:08:45,083
Chill! It's not that bad.

847
01:08:45,166 --> 01:08:47,875
No. I have made arrangements.

848
01:08:47,958 --> 01:08:49,500
-What?
-Look!

849
01:08:49,583 --> 01:08:51,208
What the hell man?

850
01:08:58,833 --> 01:09:00,875
Here, balance your front foot, okay?

851
01:09:03,958 --> 01:09:05,125
Very good, Gulab.

852
01:09:05,208 --> 01:09:07,250
Sit on your toes.

853
01:09:08,125 --> 01:09:09,166
Oh, hey!

854
01:09:10,458 --> 01:09:11,458
Hey!

855
01:09:12,250 --> 01:09:13,416
Listen, sir.

856
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:18,500
They need proper gear,
equipment, and a special diet.

857
01:09:18,583 --> 01:09:20,875
Can we arrange for sponsorship?

858
01:09:21,458 --> 01:09:24,125
Obaid, can you do something?

859
01:09:25,958 --> 01:09:30,208
Obaid told me cricket
is popular worldwide.

860
01:09:30,958 --> 01:09:32,625
I also watch it on TV.

861
01:09:37,791 --> 01:09:39,541
Here. This is a photo of our boss!

862
01:09:39,625 --> 01:09:43,083
Use it on your team banner.

863
01:09:43,166 --> 01:09:45,416
I'll also talk to Shariyar

864
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:48,666
and arrange access to the Kabul academy
to train for a few hours.

865
01:09:48,750 --> 01:09:51,000
Thanks a lot, sir.

866
01:10:01,583 --> 01:10:02,916
Try touching the nose.

867
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:06,208
Come on! Quick!

868
01:10:09,333 --> 01:10:10,291
Harder. Come on!

869
01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:15,750
Only if you work hard,
you will get selected. Understood?

870
01:10:17,041 --> 01:10:18,875
Bravo!

871
01:10:37,875 --> 01:10:41,916
<i>Last night, a NATO airstrike
targeted a Taliban hideout</i>

872
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,208
<i>in the mountainous region near Kabul.</i>

873
01:10:48,916 --> 01:10:51,958
<i>According to sources,
senior Taliban commander</i>

874
01:10:52,041 --> 01:10:54,833
<i>Mullah Mohammed Qazar
and his associate Habibullah Khan</i>

875
01:10:54,916 --> 01:10:57,208
<i>were present at the hideout </i>

876
01:10:57,291 --> 01:10:59,666
<i> and both were killed
during the airstrike.</i>

877
01:11:11,791 --> 01:11:15,625
<i>I seek refuge in God
From Satan the accursed</i>

878
01:11:15,708 --> 01:11:20,416
<i>Allah, the eternal refuge
He neither begets nor is born</i>

879
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:23,500
<i>Nor is there to Him any equivalent</i>

880
01:11:23,583 --> 01:11:26,333
<i>Thy Lord is Holy and clear
Of all that is alleged against Him</i>

881
01:11:26,416 --> 01:11:27,708
<i>And He is exalted</i>

882
01:11:27,791 --> 01:11:31,041
<i>May the peace of Allah
Be upon the Messengers</i>

883
01:11:31,125 --> 01:11:35,416
Traitors and westerners are
sitting fearlessly in Kabul.

884
01:11:38,416 --> 01:11:41,291
We will kill them in their stronghold!

885
01:11:57,625 --> 01:12:00,833
<i>Greetings!
May God's mercy and blessings be upon you.</i>

886
01:12:03,208 --> 01:12:08,291
<i>Recently the western forces
made another attack on us.</i>

887
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:14,583
<i>They are spreading
rumors that I, Abdullah Qazar,</i>

888
01:12:16,458 --> 01:12:20,500
<i>and Commander Habibullah
have died in the attack.</i>

889
01:12:22,291 --> 01:12:23,625
<i>We don't die.</i>

890
01:12:25,166 --> 01:12:26,750
<i>We achieved martyrdom.</i>

891
01:12:28,625 --> 01:12:31,333
<i>Our spirits are high
and resolve is unshaken.</i>

892
01:12:31,416 --> 01:12:35,500
<i>We will hit back hard!</i>

893
01:12:48,875 --> 01:12:53,666
<i>This is a message for those
who are trying to destroy Taliban.</i>

894
01:12:55,166 --> 01:12:57,333
<i>The day Taliban is destroyed,</i>

895
01:12:57,416 --> 01:12:59,791
<i>this country
and the whole world will burn!</i>

896
01:12:59,875 --> 01:13:03,750
<i>People who call us suicide attackers
are ignorant fools.</i>

897
01:13:04,791 --> 01:13:07,791
<i>We are martyrdom seekers, holy warriors!</i>

898
01:13:07,875 --> 01:13:10,833
<i>And it is a matter of pride for us.</i>

899
01:13:10,916 --> 01:13:13,000
<i>We will put restrictions on everything.</i>

900
01:13:13,500 --> 01:13:18,541
<i>Cinema, music.
There will be attacks everywhere.</i>

901
01:13:19,291 --> 01:13:22,291
<i>In Herat, Kunduz,</i>

902
01:13:23,208 --> 01:13:25,041
<i>American military posts.</i>

903
01:13:26,875 --> 01:13:28,958
<i>Kabul will bleed now.</i>

904
01:14:19,083 --> 01:14:22,000
Switch on the TV, sir!
There have been blasts in the city.

905
01:14:22,083 --> 01:14:23,500
There's destruction everywhere.

906
01:14:23,583 --> 01:14:26,583
Today, 20km towards the west
of the Afghan capital,

907
01:14:26,666 --> 01:14:29,000
40 people were killed in an attack.

908
01:14:29,083 --> 01:14:31,541
<i>Sources say it was a suicide attack.</i>

909
01:14:31,625 --> 01:14:34,541
<i>It targeted freshly-graduated policemen.</i>

910
01:14:34,625 --> 01:14:37,250
<i>It was a suicide attack aimed
at police officers.</i>

911
01:14:40,666 --> 01:14:41,541
Baaz!

912
01:14:43,125 --> 01:14:44,125
Come inside.

913
01:15:17,250 --> 01:15:18,208
Yes!

914
01:15:42,750 --> 01:15:46,083
Baaz, give the ball back!

915
01:16:03,083 --> 01:16:04,125
Allah.

916
01:16:05,416 --> 01:16:07,291
Light up the lives of these children

917
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:10,291
with your blessings.

918
01:16:11,041 --> 01:16:12,375
Amen.

919
01:16:12,458 --> 01:16:14,000
-Greetings.
-Greetings.

920
01:16:14,083 --> 01:16:15,833
-Greetings, Coach.
-Sit down.

921
01:16:16,416 --> 01:16:19,666
Today I have brought
the video recording of an amazing match.

922
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:24,625
Where are Baaz, Khosh Bakht, and Bakht?

923
01:16:25,208 --> 01:16:27,458
-They didn't come today.
-Are they?

924
01:16:28,125 --> 01:16:29,708
Why? Go call them.

925
01:16:30,375 --> 01:16:33,458
Coach, they have not been around
since yesterday.

926
01:16:33,541 --> 01:16:36,333
Bakht's uncle and cousin came yesterday

927
01:16:36,416 --> 01:16:38,375
and those three went with them.

928
01:16:39,333 --> 01:16:41,125
Nobody has seen them ever since.

929
01:16:42,125 --> 01:16:43,000
Look.

930
01:16:43,791 --> 01:16:46,625
Tell them not to miss practice sessions.

931
01:16:47,416 --> 01:16:50,291
The final match is close. Okay?

932
01:16:51,250 --> 01:16:54,708
Coach, there are boys
from another camp who can play.

933
01:16:54,791 --> 01:16:55,875
Should I call them?

934
01:16:57,250 --> 01:16:58,666
Should I replace you?

935
01:16:58,750 --> 01:17:01,875
No, Coach.

936
01:17:19,583 --> 01:17:20,833
Greetings.

937
01:17:29,791 --> 01:17:31,291
Allah is great!

938
01:17:34,083 --> 01:17:39,125
Those with determination
and an unshakable faith

939
01:17:41,916 --> 01:17:45,125
will never be deterred from their path.

940
01:17:47,041 --> 01:17:48,916
You disappointed me, Baaz.

941
01:17:50,375 --> 01:17:52,000
Your mother used to say

942
01:17:54,583 --> 01:17:57,250
one life should be for action!

943
01:17:59,166 --> 01:18:01,916
Mere thoughts are not enough.

944
01:18:04,958 --> 01:18:07,875
This life you are so proud of

945
01:18:10,166 --> 01:18:11,208
is dirt!

946
01:18:11,791 --> 01:18:13,208
A falcon

947
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:18,458
doesn't get deterred in the storm.

948
01:18:18,541 --> 01:18:20,166
What will you say

949
01:18:22,791 --> 01:18:25,750
when Allah questions you
on the judgment day?

950
01:18:26,250 --> 01:18:27,791
You will be ashamed.

951
01:18:29,416 --> 01:18:32,208
Your father and mother will be ashamed.

952
01:18:34,875 --> 01:18:36,333
I always aspired

953
01:18:38,083 --> 01:18:39,916
to make the ultimate sacrifice.

954
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:43,083
But someone told me,

955
01:18:44,791 --> 01:18:46,625
you take away lives.

956
01:18:56,708 --> 01:18:59,083
Your questions are valid, Baaz.

957
01:19:01,583 --> 01:19:02,833
And difficult too.

958
01:19:03,583 --> 01:19:06,083
But I will answer

959
01:19:08,916 --> 01:19:11,916
all your questions.

960
01:19:20,333 --> 01:19:22,208
Hail Allah.

961
01:19:24,875 --> 01:19:25,791
Hail Allah.

962
01:19:40,750 --> 01:19:42,583
Some of you are already trained.

963
01:19:47,500 --> 01:19:48,583
Bravo!

964
01:19:51,083 --> 01:19:53,833
The two must always be together.

965
01:20:03,375 --> 01:20:04,500
Nothing.

966
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,416
The house is empty.

967
01:20:14,083 --> 01:20:15,500
I will talk to others.

968
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:17,625
Okay?

969
01:20:21,541 --> 01:20:23,625
Don't worry. We'll find the boys.

970
01:20:24,958 --> 01:20:26,625
Okay? Let's go there.

971
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:35,583
<i>Why this destruction everywhere?</i>

972
01:20:35,666 --> 01:20:39,041
<i>Where has the peace gone?</i>

973
01:20:39,125 --> 01:20:46,125
<i>Who planted explosives in your garden?</i>

974
01:20:46,208 --> 01:20:52,791
<i>Who has cursed this fate on mankind?</i>

975
01:20:52,875 --> 01:20:59,791
<i>Why painful screams
Of the innocent fill the air?</i>

976
01:21:03,166 --> 01:21:09,708
<i>Why are they suffering?</i>

977
01:21:10,666 --> 01:21:16,083
<i>Where will this injustice end?</i>

978
01:21:17,625 --> 01:21:20,875
<i>Torn from their branches</i>

979
01:21:20,958 --> 01:21:24,625
<i>They are trampled in dirt</i>

980
01:21:24,708 --> 01:21:30,291
<i>Have mercy on these young flowers</i>

981
01:21:31,166 --> 01:21:34,583
<i>Oh, Lord!</i>

982
01:21:34,666 --> 01:21:37,125
<i>Oh, Lord!</i>

983
01:21:38,166 --> 01:21:44,625
<i>Oh, Lord! Have mercy</i>

984
01:21:45,583 --> 01:21:47,875
Greetings. Mr. Nasser, how are you?

985
01:21:48,375 --> 01:21:51,333
Greetings, Ms. Ayesha. How are you?

986
01:21:52,208 --> 01:21:54,625
He's Mr. Nasser. A close friend.

987
01:21:54,708 --> 01:21:57,208
He is doing a good work in our country.

988
01:21:57,291 --> 01:21:58,375
How are you?

989
01:21:58,458 --> 01:22:01,375
Many come here promising to hold our hand.

990
01:22:03,625 --> 01:22:06,083
All of them leave.

991
01:22:06,791 --> 01:22:08,333
He's a friend too.

992
01:22:09,666 --> 01:22:14,416
I'm thinking of appealing
to the Afghan government

993
01:22:15,708 --> 01:22:18,500
to close down all detention centers,

994
01:22:20,250 --> 01:22:22,791
and youth remand homes

995
01:22:23,666 --> 01:22:25,208
and open cricket clubs instead.

996
01:22:25,291 --> 01:22:29,208
Children living in refugee camps
are not terrorists.

997
01:22:30,458 --> 01:22:33,166
In fact, they are
the first victims of terrorism.

998
01:22:34,625 --> 01:22:38,083
Put bats in their hands and see the magic.

999
01:22:38,166 --> 01:22:41,958
Terrorists don't want progress.

1000
01:22:42,666 --> 01:22:45,541
They don't want these children
to choose the path of progress.

1001
01:23:11,833 --> 01:23:13,125
Nasser.

1002
01:23:13,833 --> 01:23:16,375
Here, try this.
Afghanistan's special Kebab.

1003
01:23:23,958 --> 01:23:24,958
Obaid.

1004
01:23:26,458 --> 01:23:28,083
I need your help.

1005
01:23:28,708 --> 01:23:29,791
Tell me.

1006
01:23:32,583 --> 01:23:33,833
I want to meet Qazar.

1007
01:23:36,958 --> 01:23:38,208
It's extremely dangerous.

1008
01:23:40,458 --> 01:23:42,041
Let me see what I can do.

1009
01:23:48,291 --> 01:23:49,750
-Greetings.
-Greetings.

1010
01:23:49,833 --> 01:23:52,333
Nasser, he's Ali. He will help us.

1011
01:24:11,083 --> 01:24:15,416
I REFUSE TO RUN

1012
01:24:15,500 --> 01:24:17,250
Greetings.

1013
01:24:19,791 --> 01:24:21,166
I want to meet Qazar.

1014
01:24:22,166 --> 01:24:23,666
I want to talk to him

1015
01:24:25,291 --> 01:24:27,375
about these kids.

1016
01:24:30,375 --> 01:24:32,208
Uncle!

1017
01:24:41,791 --> 01:24:42,875
Stop.

1018
01:24:54,750 --> 01:24:57,541
I will kill you today!

1019
01:25:02,750 --> 01:25:05,125
You want the boys.

1020
01:25:05,208 --> 01:25:07,833
You want those children?
They are my lions.

1021
01:25:07,916 --> 01:25:09,416
My soldiers.

1022
01:25:10,958 --> 01:25:12,958
They belong to me!

1023
01:25:23,333 --> 01:25:24,250
Stop it.

1024
01:25:27,458 --> 01:25:28,416
Quiet.

1025
01:25:30,291 --> 01:25:31,583
-Leave him.
-Okay.

1026
01:25:58,208 --> 01:25:59,541
Such madness!

1027
01:26:02,083 --> 01:26:03,583
What's your intention?

1028
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,500
I like cricket.

1029
01:26:10,083 --> 01:26:13,375
But these children are our soldiers.

1030
01:26:14,083 --> 01:26:16,875
They have been trained
for a bigger purpose.

1031
01:26:22,625 --> 01:26:24,500
I've heard a lot about you.

1032
01:26:26,958 --> 01:26:29,125
The people of Afghanistan dread you.

1033
01:26:30,458 --> 01:26:33,333
The common man and the army.

1034
01:26:41,583 --> 01:26:43,541
But I am not scared of you.

1035
01:26:45,875 --> 01:26:47,958
These innocent children deserve

1036
01:26:49,041 --> 01:26:50,375
the small joys of childhood.

1037
01:26:51,833 --> 01:26:53,958
Their innocence died the day

1038
01:26:56,333 --> 01:27:00,208
they saw their homes
and families destroyed.

1039
01:27:00,291 --> 01:27:01,583
These western powers

1040
01:27:03,250 --> 01:27:08,416
have given us such pain.
They have destroyed our generations!

1041
01:27:09,375 --> 01:27:13,916
Even Allah says,
"don't snatch someone's dreams."

1042
01:27:15,166 --> 01:27:16,416
These children need

1043
01:27:17,541 --> 01:27:20,000
hope and faith.

1044
01:27:21,166 --> 01:27:23,333
In hope of a better life

1045
01:27:24,125 --> 01:27:26,958
and to serve justice,

1046
01:27:27,500 --> 01:27:29,666
we've sacrificed everything.

1047
01:27:30,625 --> 01:27:32,083
We are hiding here and fighting!

1048
01:27:32,833 --> 01:27:36,208
What's your motive?
To make them play cricket?

1049
01:27:37,875 --> 01:27:40,125
Or do you intend to do something else?

1050
01:27:42,083 --> 01:27:45,000
You pray five times
to seek fulfillment of your purpose.

1051
01:27:46,916 --> 01:27:47,916
And I pray five times…

1052
01:27:52,708 --> 01:27:56,250
for the happiness of these children.

1053
01:27:58,666 --> 01:28:01,833
Let's see whose prayer is granted.

1054
01:28:07,791 --> 01:28:10,291
You are a different kind of crazy!

1055
01:28:14,541 --> 01:28:17,291
But I can't accept your request.

1056
01:28:17,375 --> 01:28:21,833
Every country, every man, wants you dead.

1057
01:28:23,250 --> 01:28:25,416
I'm not here to defeat you.

1058
01:28:26,625 --> 01:28:28,416
I want to win you over.

1059
01:28:28,500 --> 01:28:30,416
These children deserve a chance.

1060
01:28:33,125 --> 01:28:37,291
They have worked so hard for this match.

1061
01:28:38,458 --> 01:28:40,666
The Taliban also play cricket.

1062
01:28:42,041 --> 01:28:43,500
We like it.

1063
01:28:44,416 --> 01:28:46,875
I like bowling.

1064
01:28:48,416 --> 01:28:52,458
You are a kind person,
fearless, and courageous.

1065
01:28:57,458 --> 01:28:58,916
My heart says

1066
01:29:01,541 --> 01:29:03,083
I should forgive you.

1067
01:29:03,666 --> 01:29:06,166
Their life is dedicated
to a higher purpose.

1068
01:29:11,291 --> 01:29:13,958
Don't misguide them.

1069
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,666
Go back to your country

1070
01:29:19,750 --> 01:29:22,708
and let these children serve their faith!

1071
01:29:23,833 --> 01:29:25,541
If their faith is real,

1072
01:29:26,541 --> 01:29:27,958
they will remain true to it.

1073
01:29:29,291 --> 01:29:33,458
But if it's shaken, it wasn't their faith
but your indoctrination!

1074
01:29:36,916 --> 01:29:38,041
Just one match.

1075
01:29:40,125 --> 01:29:42,250
This match can become an example!

1076
01:29:43,041 --> 01:29:44,500
Just one.

1077
01:29:44,583 --> 01:29:46,875
The world will be watching it.

1078
01:29:49,083 --> 01:29:52,541
The media will cover these refugee kids
as they take on a professional team.

1079
01:29:54,333 --> 01:29:56,833
Entire Afghanistan will watch them.

1080
01:29:57,750 --> 01:30:00,958
Just one match, Qazar.

1081
01:30:02,541 --> 01:30:04,875
Calm down. Let go!

1082
01:30:08,416 --> 01:30:09,875
Just one.

1083
01:30:12,541 --> 01:30:16,916
Okay. But make it quick.
Hold the match this Friday.

1084
01:30:50,875 --> 01:30:52,125
Don't forget your purpose.

1085
01:31:04,125 --> 01:31:05,291
Here.

1086
01:31:06,208 --> 01:31:07,333
Catch it.

1087
01:31:10,583 --> 01:31:13,916
Baaz, where were you?

1088
01:31:19,083 --> 01:31:20,291
Practice catching.

1089
01:31:21,583 --> 01:31:23,291
Come on, Gulab!

1090
01:31:38,375 --> 01:31:40,625
Baaz!

1091
01:31:45,916 --> 01:31:47,416
What's wrong with him?

1092
01:31:49,458 --> 01:31:52,375
-What happened to the Talib?
-I don't know!

1093
01:32:19,833 --> 01:32:20,833
Sir.

1094
01:32:21,500 --> 01:32:23,333
I want to talk to you.

1095
01:32:25,083 --> 01:32:26,916
The coach has called me,

1096
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:31,875
Baaz, and Khosh Bakht
to the mosque to offer prayers.

1097
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:33,916
Sit here.

1098
01:32:38,833 --> 01:32:41,458
Go, but remember this.

1099
01:32:42,041 --> 01:32:43,708
Our fight is our highest purpose.

1100
01:32:44,250 --> 01:32:47,333
Ours is a different world.

1101
01:32:54,541 --> 01:32:55,458
Listen.

1102
01:32:57,833 --> 01:33:00,791
Tell your coach not to act smart.

1103
01:33:00,875 --> 01:33:03,666
We are keeping an eye on him.

1104
01:33:05,083 --> 01:33:07,083
Do you understand?

1105
01:33:11,125 --> 01:33:14,333
We want to tell the whole world.

1106
01:33:14,958 --> 01:33:18,375
That NATO and the Americans

1107
01:33:19,416 --> 01:33:20,958
have forcefully attacked

1108
01:33:21,958 --> 01:33:23,916
and occupied

1109
01:33:24,625 --> 01:33:25,958
our country.

1110
01:33:26,041 --> 01:33:28,625
And unfortunately,

1111
01:33:28,708 --> 01:33:31,208
our own Afghan army

1112
01:33:32,375 --> 01:33:34,291
is against our mission to destroy them.

1113
01:33:34,875 --> 01:33:37,750
We have an idea about those refugee boys.

1114
01:33:37,833 --> 01:33:40,541
Okay, we know they probably met
with Qazar and his men.

1115
01:33:40,625 --> 01:33:43,333
And they're probably meeting
with militant groups right now.

1116
01:33:43,416 --> 01:33:47,000
NATO and the Afghan army are against us!

1117
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,333
They hate our holy warriors!

1118
01:33:51,625 --> 01:33:56,500
Their opposition has made
our youth's resolve stronger.

1119
01:33:57,083 --> 01:34:01,500
That's why our educated youth is also
joining this fight against non-believers.

1120
01:34:02,208 --> 01:34:05,375
And this Nasser, he's completely crazy!

1121
01:34:05,458 --> 01:34:08,333
Okay, this whole cricket match,
I'm thinking, was a bad idea.

1122
01:34:09,875 --> 01:34:14,333
We have created an army against the enemy,

1123
01:34:17,833 --> 01:34:21,541
that is eager to die for the cause.

1124
01:34:21,625 --> 01:34:26,083
Our next generations will be told stories
of our valor and sacrifice.

1125
01:34:26,166 --> 01:34:29,500
I trust those boys.
They cannot hurt anybody.

1126
01:34:29,583 --> 01:34:31,416
Khan, they are trained soldiers!

1127
01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:33,708
They're just innocent boys

1128
01:34:33,791 --> 01:34:35,375
who are being entrapped.

1129
01:34:36,791 --> 01:34:39,291
I hope you are right. I really do.

1130
01:34:39,375 --> 01:34:43,583
Even just for a moment of attention,

1131
01:34:43,666 --> 01:34:46,125
we must make noise everyday.

1132
01:34:46,208 --> 01:34:47,375
Sure.

1133
01:35:00,250 --> 01:35:02,291
My house was beautiful.

1134
01:35:02,375 --> 01:35:05,583
We lived atop a mountain.

1135
01:35:05,666 --> 01:35:09,583
But the entire family
was wiped off in just a day!

1136
01:35:13,375 --> 01:35:16,041
It's nothing but a burial ground now.

1137
01:35:21,166 --> 01:35:24,000
Our village was under attack
for many days.

1138
01:35:24,625 --> 01:35:27,416
<i>When the fighting subsided,</i>

1139
01:35:27,500 --> 01:35:30,041
<i>Mother sent us
to the shop to get some food.</i>

1140
01:35:31,500 --> 01:35:33,625
<i>Dodging bullets was an everyday affair.</i>

1141
01:35:45,791 --> 01:35:48,000
<i>I thought my brother tripped.</i>

1142
01:35:48,083 --> 01:35:50,083
<i>He was lying on the ground.</i>

1143
01:35:54,750 --> 01:35:59,375
My uncle told me it was a foreign soldier.

1144
01:36:05,583 --> 01:36:07,375
<i>Mother always taught me</i>

1145
01:36:08,333 --> 01:36:09,583
to be noble,

1146
01:36:10,666 --> 01:36:12,375
to hurt no one.

1147
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:14,458
<i>And one day…</i>

1148
01:36:23,375 --> 01:36:25,791
People call me Talib.

1149
01:36:26,875 --> 01:36:28,250
I was told

1150
01:36:29,333 --> 01:36:31,916
being a self-sacrificing soldier
is the ultimate cause.

1151
01:36:46,875 --> 01:36:49,250
I lost Aryan and Meera here.

1152
01:36:50,791 --> 01:36:52,625
I saw their smiles

1153
01:36:53,875 --> 01:36:55,583
for the last time here.

1154
01:37:03,708 --> 01:37:06,125
When I sleep,

1155
01:37:06,791 --> 01:37:08,375
it all feels like a nightmare.

1156
01:37:09,708 --> 01:37:13,125
I talk to them. Play cricket with Aryan.

1157
01:37:14,250 --> 01:37:15,666
It feels as if they are alive.

1158
01:37:19,916 --> 01:37:21,458
But when I open my eyes…

1159
01:37:51,333 --> 01:37:55,625
I am as heartbroken about Niaz's death

1160
01:37:56,958 --> 01:37:58,291
as Aryan's.

1161
01:38:44,666 --> 01:38:46,958
<i>Over 2,000 people are here
to watch the match.</i>

1162
01:38:47,041 --> 01:38:49,458
This is a very unique match
because for many

1163
01:38:49,541 --> 01:38:52,541
it's a symbol of hope and pride,
especially for the young kids.

1164
01:38:52,625 --> 01:38:56,625
We are so excited that from
our beloved and friendly country India,

1165
01:38:56,708 --> 01:38:59,041
this guy has come

1166
01:38:59,125 --> 01:39:02,791
to guide our Afghani kids

1167
01:39:02,875 --> 01:39:06,041
towards peace and harmony.

1168
01:39:06,125 --> 01:39:08,166
We would like to extend
our gratitude to him.

1169
01:39:08,250 --> 01:39:09,791
He's an ex-army colonel.

1170
01:39:09,875 --> 01:39:14,958
He taught these refugee children
to play cricket.

1171
01:39:15,041 --> 01:39:17,750
-Come on, boys!
-Good! He is a noble soul.

1172
01:39:21,083 --> 01:39:24,708
Kabul Juniors has won the toss.

1173
01:39:29,333 --> 01:39:30,541
Bravo!

1174
01:39:36,791 --> 01:39:42,083
People from faraway places have come
to see the new Afghanistan.

1175
01:39:42,166 --> 01:39:45,250
To watch these children play

1176
01:39:45,333 --> 01:39:47,541
in this violence-ridden country,

1177
01:39:47,625 --> 01:39:49,666
such moments of joy are indeed rare.

1178
01:39:56,500 --> 01:39:58,541
It is your victory, Baaz.

1179
01:40:04,083 --> 01:40:06,166
Go! Come on!

1180
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,625
It's a cakewalk for us! Bravo!

1181
01:40:25,541 --> 01:40:26,708
Bowl well, Imlal.

1182
01:40:28,166 --> 01:40:32,375
Imlal is the opening bowler
from team Torbaaz.

1183
01:40:39,916 --> 01:40:41,541
His first delivery…

1184
01:40:42,916 --> 01:40:43,750
A wide ball

1185
01:40:43,833 --> 01:40:46,666
Come on! Do better.

1186
01:40:53,750 --> 01:40:57,458
Played on the leg-side
towards the boundary.

1187
01:40:57,541 --> 01:40:58,541
It's with Ali Sher.

1188
01:40:58,625 --> 01:41:02,916
A chance for a run-out. A lost chance!

1189
01:41:14,333 --> 01:41:15,708
It's a no-ball.

1190
01:41:15,791 --> 01:41:19,166
The batting side gets a free-hit.

1191
01:41:22,708 --> 01:41:24,000
Bravo, Imlal!

1192
01:41:27,916 --> 01:41:29,958
Another wide.

1193
01:41:34,875 --> 01:41:36,291
The next one.

1194
01:41:37,041 --> 01:41:38,250
And that's a six!

1195
01:41:42,083 --> 01:41:45,708
Torbaaz has conceded
11 runs in just 2 balls.

1196
01:41:45,791 --> 01:41:47,083
Listen to me.

1197
01:41:47,166 --> 01:41:50,208
Team Torbaaz is concerned.

1198
01:41:50,291 --> 01:41:52,583
Captain Gulab looks stressed.

1199
01:41:56,958 --> 01:41:58,333
Catch it!

1200
01:41:59,958 --> 01:42:02,791
All that discussion was of no use.

1201
01:42:08,666 --> 01:42:11,875
-Another no-ball because of overstepping.
-What are you doing?

1202
01:42:11,958 --> 01:42:13,833
Team Torbaaz looks nervous.

1203
01:42:14,541 --> 01:42:17,250
-Catch it!
-Another boundary!

1204
01:42:18,375 --> 01:42:20,166
They are not able to.

1205
01:42:20,250 --> 01:42:22,458
Team Kabul Juniors stands at

1206
01:42:22,958 --> 01:42:25,541
20 runs without any loss.

1207
01:42:27,666 --> 01:42:30,208
Khosh Bakht is the next bowler.

1208
01:42:31,333 --> 01:42:32,750
Come on!

1209
01:42:49,541 --> 01:42:51,833
{\an8}This match seems like a one-way street.

1210
01:42:52,833 --> 01:42:55,166
{\an8}You are right, sir.

1211
01:42:56,375 --> 01:42:57,375
Catch it.

1212
01:42:59,500 --> 01:43:00,750
Today is a bad day!

1213
01:43:03,166 --> 01:43:06,958
It is a magnificent sweep-shot.

1214
01:43:07,041 --> 01:43:11,333
A boundary. Kabul Juniors
have scored 42 without any loss.

1215
01:43:11,416 --> 01:43:16,125
Another boundary.
The score is 53 runs in 5 overs.

1216
01:43:18,958 --> 01:43:21,208
I will bowl.

1217
01:43:21,291 --> 01:43:22,541
I will.

1218
01:43:22,625 --> 01:43:24,541
Let me bowl.

1219
01:43:24,625 --> 01:43:26,541
I want to.

1220
01:43:27,875 --> 01:43:30,583
A small kid is the next bowler.

1221
01:43:31,208 --> 01:43:34,666
A wide ball!

1222
01:43:34,750 --> 01:43:36,666
An extra four runs!

1223
01:43:42,958 --> 01:43:44,875
Useless drama!

1224
01:43:44,958 --> 01:43:48,041
The situation is tense in the city.

1225
01:43:50,375 --> 01:43:52,791
Keep an eye on these refugee children.

1226
01:43:52,875 --> 01:43:54,166
I have heard

1227
01:43:54,666 --> 01:43:56,583
there are many sympathizers in their camp.

1228
01:43:56,666 --> 01:44:00,375
Mr. Shariyar, we are doing our job.

1229
01:44:01,375 --> 01:44:03,125
Please worry about yours.

1230
01:44:03,208 --> 01:44:06,541
Your team could get in trouble.

1231
01:44:10,958 --> 01:44:12,708
Sadiq is bowling!

1232
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:16,541
{\an8}Out!

1233
01:44:16,625 --> 01:44:20,333
{\an8}Torbaaz claims their first wicket!
Kabul Juniors 58 at a loss of 1.

1234
01:44:20,416 --> 01:44:23,875
{\an8}Sadiq tricked the batsman!

1235
01:44:24,375 --> 01:44:27,416
The batsman could not read it.

1236
01:44:30,333 --> 01:44:32,708
Doesn't look like losing a wicket
has affected them.

1237
01:44:32,791 --> 01:44:38,208
The vice-captain, Baaz, is an all-rounder.

1238
01:44:38,291 --> 01:44:41,541
-He's the bowler. Let's see.
<i>-Howzat?</i>

1239
01:44:41,625 --> 01:44:44,208
<i>-Howzat?</i>
-Hey!

1240
01:44:44,291 --> 01:44:45,458
Close one!

1241
01:44:46,958 --> 01:44:48,500
The next delivery.

1242
01:44:49,125 --> 01:44:52,833
{\an8}He claims the wicket. Baaz strikes!

1243
01:44:52,916 --> 01:44:55,875
{\an8}Kabul Juniors
is at 103 runs at a loss of 2.

1244
01:44:56,500 --> 01:45:00,125
Up next is Imlal.
Let's see what Imlal does now.

1245
01:45:00,208 --> 01:45:01,750
The next one.

1246
01:45:03,708 --> 01:45:05,958
{\an8}It is a marvelous catch!

1247
01:45:06,041 --> 01:45:10,625
{\an8}The score is 140 runs at a loss of 3.

1248
01:45:11,750 --> 01:45:12,625
{\an8}Bravo!

1249
01:45:14,875 --> 01:45:19,958
{\an8}A strong appeal.
A dismissal! The fourth one!

1250
01:45:21,916 --> 01:45:25,166
{\an8}What a fightback! Imlal eyes a hat-trick.

1251
01:45:27,416 --> 01:45:30,541
{\an8}He does it! A hat-trick!

1252
01:45:30,625 --> 01:45:34,125
{\an8}Imlal has fought back in style!

1253
01:45:34,208 --> 01:45:36,583
{\an8}Amazing performance by Imlal.

1254
01:45:36,666 --> 01:45:38,625
It is high in the air.

1255
01:45:38,708 --> 01:45:41,916
A fielder is following it.

1256
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:43,458
{\an8}A catch! Dismissal!

1257
01:45:43,541 --> 01:45:46,333
{\an8}Torbaaz is on fire!

1258
01:45:46,416 --> 01:45:49,750
{\an8}The score is 149 for 6.

1259
01:45:51,958 --> 01:45:57,333
{\an8}Another dismissal! It's at 156 for 7.

1260
01:45:58,208 --> 01:46:01,083
{\an8}Catch it! Come on!

1261
01:46:01,166 --> 01:46:02,833
Hooray!

1262
01:46:04,666 --> 01:46:06,541
{\an8}It's now 164 for 9.

1263
01:46:06,625 --> 01:46:10,166
{\an8}KABUL JUNIORS: 164/9

1264
01:46:19,166 --> 01:46:22,375
{\an8}Amazing! That's superb.

1265
01:46:22,458 --> 01:46:26,166
{\an8}At 165, Kabul Juniors have lost all their
wickets and their final score

1266
01:46:26,250 --> 01:46:27,625
{\an8}is 165.

1267
01:46:45,083 --> 01:46:49,208
It's a tough task for Team Torbaaz
to chase a score of 166.

1268
01:46:57,833 --> 01:47:00,625
-Watch the ball, play the shot. Okay?
-Absolutely!

1269
01:47:00,708 --> 01:47:01,583
Mr. Nasser.

1270
01:47:02,666 --> 01:47:04,250
Your team is playing really well.

1271
01:47:04,333 --> 01:47:05,208
Thank you.

1272
01:47:08,250 --> 01:47:10,791
-I'm sorry to hear about your brother.
-Torbaaz!

1273
01:47:10,875 --> 01:47:14,083
Afghanistan has become a graveyard.

1274
01:47:15,041 --> 01:47:17,083
People like us have donned the uniform

1275
01:47:17,166 --> 01:47:21,583
to try and bring peace.

1276
01:47:21,666 --> 01:47:26,208
As I said,
it is going to be a tough match.

1277
01:47:26,291 --> 01:47:30,625
Especially since Team Torbaaz
is facing professional players.

1278
01:47:35,583 --> 01:47:38,291
A boundary to start with!

1279
01:47:38,375 --> 01:47:41,625
They are good players!

1280
01:47:46,666 --> 01:47:47,958
Run!

1281
01:47:51,916 --> 01:47:54,083
{\an8}-A dismissal!
-Howzat!

1282
01:47:54,166 --> 01:47:59,333
{\an8}Torbaaz is one wicket down!
They are now at five for one.

1283
01:48:02,166 --> 01:48:03,000
Bravo!

1284
01:48:06,750 --> 01:48:07,833
What's happening?

1285
01:48:07,916 --> 01:48:10,458
What's happening, umpire?

1286
01:48:10,541 --> 01:48:12,875
-What's happening?
-What's this, Nasser?

1287
01:48:12,958 --> 01:48:15,291
He's a good batsman but needs a runner.

1288
01:48:15,375 --> 01:48:17,458
What's this? This is cricket.
This is not done.

1289
01:48:17,541 --> 01:48:19,625
If he's handicapped, let him stay home!

1290
01:48:19,708 --> 01:48:21,625
-This is unfair.
-How will he run?

1291
01:48:22,333 --> 01:48:25,416
Let him stay home. Why make him play?

1292
01:48:25,500 --> 01:48:27,125
The batsman has to run himself.

1293
01:48:30,708 --> 01:48:33,458
Looks like the umpire
is not in favor of Wahid.

1294
01:48:33,541 --> 01:48:35,750
Wahid must run himself.

1295
01:48:44,416 --> 01:48:48,708
Captain Gulab is batting magnificently.

1296
01:48:48,791 --> 01:48:51,458
Amazing! He's on fire.

1297
01:48:53,125 --> 01:48:56,625
Wahid's shot landed
in the fielder's hands.

1298
01:48:57,125 --> 01:48:58,125
He's misfielded!

1299
01:48:58,208 --> 01:49:00,916
Wahid can't run. Gulab has to go back.

1300
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,833
What a throw at the bowler's end.

1301
01:49:03,916 --> 01:49:06,375
{\an8}Out! A wonderful run-out!

1302
01:49:06,458 --> 01:49:09,500
{\an8}Now Torbaaz is at 38 for 2.

1303
01:49:09,583 --> 01:49:12,125
{\an8}Kabul Junior was at 103 for 2.

1304
01:49:12,208 --> 01:49:13,583
{\an8}They are already two down.

1305
01:49:19,333 --> 01:49:20,541
Bravo, Baaz!

1306
01:49:22,916 --> 01:49:24,458
-Baaz!
-Baaz!

1307
01:49:24,541 --> 01:49:27,375
-The vice-captain is here.
-Baaz!

1308
01:49:27,458 --> 01:49:30,208
Let's see what he does.

1309
01:49:32,541 --> 01:49:35,041
A six off the first delivery!

1310
01:49:40,625 --> 01:49:44,541
He's boosted his team's morale.

1311
01:49:45,750 --> 01:49:47,416
Come on!

1312
01:49:48,125 --> 01:49:52,458
Wahid can't run well.
Hope he doesn't affect Baaz's game.

1313
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:54,708
He's doing it.

1314
01:50:01,166 --> 01:50:04,250
Baaz hits another six!

1315
01:50:07,875 --> 01:50:09,375
Wahid's lofty shot…

1316
01:50:09,458 --> 01:50:11,083
Oh, dear! And he's out.

1317
01:50:11,166 --> 01:50:13,125
{\an8}Wahid is out.

1318
01:50:13,208 --> 01:50:17,208
{\an8}Torbaaz is at 58 for 3.

1319
01:50:17,958 --> 01:50:19,833
{\an8}Coach, I must go.

1320
01:50:19,916 --> 01:50:21,958
They are in trouble.

1321
01:50:22,041 --> 01:50:24,000
-Yes. Ali Sher!
-Yes?

1322
01:50:24,083 --> 01:50:25,708
-Come back.
-Yes.

1323
01:50:25,791 --> 01:50:27,666
Imlal, you go.

1324
01:50:34,416 --> 01:50:37,875
Imlal scores a six!

1325
01:50:43,083 --> 01:50:44,750
He's in good form!

1326
01:50:44,833 --> 01:50:46,958
He needs to maintain this.

1327
01:50:48,208 --> 01:50:52,583
{\an8}Imlal can't seem to stop! Another six!

1328
01:50:53,958 --> 01:50:55,041
{\an8}Yes!

1329
01:51:14,750 --> 01:51:18,625
{\an8}Imlal hits another six.

1330
01:51:23,250 --> 01:51:25,125
-Imlal!
-Imlal!

1331
01:51:26,833 --> 01:51:30,250
Imlal hits in the air,
there is a fielder below it.

1332
01:51:30,333 --> 01:51:32,791
{\an8}Imlal is out!

1333
01:51:34,416 --> 01:51:38,708
{\an8}Imlal was playing really well.
He's caught.

1334
01:51:38,791 --> 01:51:42,666
{\an8}Team Torbaaz at 98 for 4.
It's disappointing.

1335
01:51:46,500 --> 01:51:48,875
Khosh Bakht is the next batsman.

1336
01:51:48,958 --> 01:51:52,666
-Do you know the meaning of Khosh Bakht?
-Tell me…

1337
01:51:52,750 --> 01:51:55,333
His name means good luck.

1338
01:51:55,416 --> 01:51:56,791
Good luck.

1339
01:51:56,875 --> 01:51:59,333
It means good fortune.

1340
01:51:59,416 --> 01:52:01,875
He is living up to his name.

1341
01:52:01,958 --> 01:52:06,291
{\an8}The audience is all pumped-up.

1342
01:52:06,375 --> 01:52:08,625
{\an8}Two adept batsmen on the pitch.

1343
01:52:08,708 --> 01:52:11,875
{\an8}Kabul Juniors are in trouble.

1344
01:52:11,958 --> 01:52:14,333
They are both playing well.

1345
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:20,125
{\an8}Khosh Bakht comes down the pitch
and hits a boundary!

1346
01:52:21,958 --> 01:52:23,333
-Torbaaz!
-Torbaaz!

1347
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:25,291
-Torbaaz!
-Torbaaz!

1348
01:52:32,916 --> 01:52:33,875
Bowled!

1349
01:52:33,958 --> 01:52:36,250
{\an8}He couldn't read the ball.

1350
01:52:36,333 --> 01:52:39,458
{\an8}Torbaaz is at 138 for 5.

1351
01:52:46,166 --> 01:52:48,708
Khosh Bakht… your good luck is gone, sir.

1352
01:52:48,791 --> 01:52:51,125
Yes, but the next one is Bakht.

1353
01:52:52,083 --> 01:52:56,833
Good is gone but luck is still with us.

1354
01:53:03,666 --> 01:53:06,041
Just a few balls left.
28 runs left to score.

1355
01:53:13,541 --> 01:53:18,500
He takes a single. Now, Baaz is on strike.

1356
01:53:29,750 --> 01:53:30,750
Come on.

1357
01:53:32,750 --> 01:53:35,791
-Baaz calls a second run. Bakht refuses.
-No, Baaz, go back.

1358
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:40,375
-Wow!
-Run!

1359
01:53:41,958 --> 01:53:43,375
A boundary!

1360
01:53:43,458 --> 01:53:44,791
Bravo!

1361
01:53:46,875 --> 01:53:48,208
Yes!

1362
01:53:48,916 --> 01:53:52,416
The next one, he's hit!

1363
01:53:52,500 --> 01:53:54,166
He seems injured.

1364
01:53:56,583 --> 01:53:58,791
Everything's fine.

1365
01:54:01,833 --> 01:54:03,250
The next one.

1366
01:54:04,041 --> 01:54:05,333
Out!

1367
01:54:06,083 --> 01:54:08,958
{\an8}He's out on the last bowl
of the 19th over.

1368
01:54:09,583 --> 01:54:13,416
{\an8}Torbaaz is 145 for 6.

1369
01:54:14,458 --> 01:54:18,250
{\an8}They need 21 runs off the last over.

1370
01:54:25,958 --> 01:54:27,208
It's 21 runs off 6 balls.

1371
01:54:32,833 --> 01:54:35,666
{\an8}-Sadiq is on the pitch.
-Sadiq.

1372
01:54:35,750 --> 01:54:39,500
{\an8}Baaz is on strike.
They will need 21 runs off 6 balls to win.

1373
01:54:40,416 --> 01:54:42,666
{\an8}First ball of the over.
He strikes a boundary!

1374
01:54:42,750 --> 01:54:47,416
{\an8}-It's 17 off 5 balls now.
-Good! Very good, Baaz!

1375
01:54:47,500 --> 01:54:48,541
{\an8}Keep it up.

1376
01:54:50,708 --> 01:54:52,083
Next one.

1377
01:54:52,666 --> 01:54:56,666
{\an8}A straight drive and a six-down long-off.

1378
01:54:58,375 --> 01:55:02,250
{\an8}Baaz just wants to finish it off.

1379
01:55:02,333 --> 01:55:05,416
{\an8}Just 11 runs off 4 balls is needed now.

1380
01:55:07,166 --> 01:55:09,500
What's this? Pitch it fully.

1381
01:55:09,583 --> 01:55:10,916
Target the legs.

1382
01:55:20,125 --> 01:55:21,208
A call for a couple.

1383
01:55:22,666 --> 01:55:25,625
-Baaz!
-Sadiq says no!

1384
01:55:26,333 --> 01:55:29,125
I called for a couple. Don't you get it?

1385
01:55:29,958 --> 01:55:31,750
It would've been a dismissal.

1386
01:55:31,833 --> 01:55:35,083
-Torbaaz!
-Torbaaz!

1387
01:55:35,666 --> 01:55:39,125
-Torbaaz!
-Torbaaz!

1388
01:55:39,208 --> 01:55:40,041
Go!

1389
01:55:45,125 --> 01:55:49,000
{\an8}Ten off three balls
and Sadiq is on strike.

1390
01:55:49,083 --> 01:55:50,416
The next one.

1391
01:55:50,500 --> 01:55:56,833
Sadiq has hit it and has taken a single.

1392
01:55:56,916 --> 01:55:58,541
He left the bat!

1393
01:56:02,250 --> 01:56:06,083
{\an8}Nine runs off two balls.
Baaz is on strike.

1394
01:56:15,416 --> 01:56:17,291
The next one.

1395
01:56:17,916 --> 01:56:19,333
He hits it.

1396
01:56:19,416 --> 01:56:22,250
Bravo! A six!

1397
01:56:23,375 --> 01:56:27,375
{\an8}It was a decisive delivery.

1398
01:56:27,458 --> 01:56:30,291
{\an8}Three runs off one ball needed.

1399
01:56:44,208 --> 01:56:45,666
{\an8}Be with me, Lord.

1400
01:57:16,333 --> 01:57:17,833
Come on!

1401
01:57:22,750 --> 01:57:24,333
Run!

1402
01:57:34,083 --> 01:57:37,250
-Hit it!
-A chance for a run-out.

1403
01:57:37,333 --> 01:57:38,833
Out!

1404
01:57:38,916 --> 01:57:41,791
Kabul Juniors has won it!

1405
01:57:55,500 --> 01:57:57,333
Bravo!

1406
01:58:10,791 --> 01:58:12,250
Not out! What!

1407
01:58:13,333 --> 01:58:17,166
-Run, Sadiq!
-Umpire says it's not out!

1408
01:58:17,791 --> 01:58:22,458
An overthrow. Sadiq runs for another one.

1409
01:58:27,291 --> 01:58:30,125
They are running the third one.

1410
01:58:34,791 --> 01:58:37,625
They completed the run…

1411
01:58:37,708 --> 01:58:41,041
And Torbaaz won!

1412
01:58:41,125 --> 01:58:47,041
Kabul Juniors
could have never imagined it!

1413
01:58:47,125 --> 01:58:50,208
Congratulations to Team Torbaaz!

1414
01:58:50,291 --> 01:58:51,916
Wow!

1415
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:57,541
What a feat these
refugee children have achieved!

1416
01:58:58,625 --> 01:59:00,833
Entire Afghanistan
will remember this match.

1417
01:59:00,916 --> 01:59:03,041
Absolutely, sir.

1418
01:59:56,375 --> 01:59:58,083
Baaz.

1419
01:59:58,958 --> 02:00:00,416
Baaz.

1420
02:00:01,791 --> 02:00:04,291
-Have you seen Baaz?
-He must be here, somewhere.

1421
02:00:16,875 --> 02:00:18,458
Hey, Baaz.

1422
02:00:31,666 --> 02:00:32,875
Run!

1423
02:00:50,166 --> 02:00:51,833
Come quickly!

1424
02:00:51,916 --> 02:00:53,708
Run! Hurry up! Run faster.

1425
02:00:54,750 --> 02:00:56,500
Almas?

1426
02:00:56,583 --> 02:00:57,791
Come over here!

1427
02:01:17,166 --> 02:01:18,625
Go faster.

1428
02:01:21,458 --> 02:01:22,708
Get that boy up.

1429
02:01:24,666 --> 02:01:25,833
Go to the other side.

1430
02:01:33,208 --> 02:01:34,541
Over here!

1431
02:02:18,041 --> 02:02:19,791
Come here as fast as you can.

1432
02:02:24,125 --> 02:02:25,166
Coach.

1433
02:02:32,875 --> 02:02:34,166
Don't do it, Baaz.

1434
02:02:34,750 --> 02:02:37,250
Everything will be fine. I am here.

1435
02:02:38,083 --> 02:02:39,333
Don't do it.

1436
02:02:40,416 --> 02:02:41,875
Come as fast as you can.

1437
02:02:44,250 --> 02:02:45,333
It will be fine.

1438
02:02:45,416 --> 02:02:47,291
Come over here. Take the right side.

1439
02:02:49,708 --> 02:02:53,083
<i>In the name of God,
the merciful and compassionate.</i>

1440
02:02:54,166 --> 02:02:58,125
<i>In the name of God,
the merciful and compassionate.</i>

1441
02:02:58,958 --> 02:03:03,125
<i>Mother would've been proud of me today.</i>

1442
02:03:03,208 --> 02:03:05,666
<i>In the name of God,
the merciful and compassionate.</i>

1443
02:03:07,083 --> 02:03:10,708
<i>In the name of God,
the merciful and compassionate.</i>

1444
02:03:10,791 --> 02:03:12,291
Run faster.

1445
02:03:20,166 --> 02:03:23,333
<i>This match was the best moment of my life.</i>

1446
02:03:37,125 --> 02:03:39,791
Why should we,
children, sacrifice every time?

1447
02:03:40,791 --> 02:03:43,625
<i>Habibullah is ready for the sacrifice.</i>

1448
02:04:00,625 --> 02:04:02,041
What are you doing here, Baaz?

1449
02:04:03,041 --> 02:04:05,375
What are you doing, Baaz?

1450
02:04:05,958 --> 02:04:07,125
Go there.

1451
02:04:07,208 --> 02:04:09,708
Your resolve is firm.

1452
02:04:09,791 --> 02:04:12,750
Fulfill your objective.

1453
02:04:12,833 --> 02:04:15,208
I don't want to go to heaven alone.

1454
02:04:16,250 --> 02:04:17,291
Let's go together.

1455
02:04:20,500 --> 02:04:22,625
Shameless boy. Let go of me.

1456
02:04:31,291 --> 02:04:32,125
{\an8}Baaz!

1457
02:05:12,625 --> 02:05:13,958
I promise

1458
02:05:14,916 --> 02:05:16,541
I will not let you down.

1459
02:05:18,416 --> 02:05:21,458
<i>Forgive me, Coach.</i>

1460
02:05:23,083 --> 02:05:25,458
<i>I couldn't be a part of the team.</i>

1461
02:05:27,708 --> 02:05:28,916
<i>But don't be sad.</i>

1462
02:05:29,666 --> 02:05:31,666
<i>Gulab,</i>

1463
02:05:31,750 --> 02:05:35,208
<i>he'll be the best batsman ever.</i>

1464
02:05:39,083 --> 02:05:40,666
<i>And Imlal,</i>

1465
02:05:42,083 --> 02:05:43,458
<i>he's a terrific bowler.</i>

1466
02:05:44,666 --> 02:05:46,333
<i>But he's short-tempered.</i>

1467
02:05:48,666 --> 02:05:51,625
<i>Sadiq is too young</i>,

1468
02:05:51,708 --> 02:05:53,916
<i>but he's very brave.</i>

1469
02:05:56,125 --> 02:05:57,125
<i>Coach, </i>

1470
02:05:58,166 --> 02:05:59,875
<i>take care of them all.</i>

1471
02:06:04,666 --> 02:06:05,833
<i>Goodbye.</i>

1472
02:12:39,250 --> 02:12:44,250
