1
00:03:27,516 --> 00:03:28,433
It looks like it will rain.

2
00:03:28,475 --> 00:03:29,850
Ask the children to come in.

3
00:03:30,266 --> 00:03:32,433
Hurry up.

4
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:37,766
Swetha...
- I’ll come after a while.

5
00:03:38,141 --> 00:03:39,141
Swetha...

6
00:03:40,058 --> 00:03:42,475
Swetha, listen to me.
Come in.

7
00:03:57,141 --> 00:04:02,183
Ever since the accident,
Swetha has not been the same.

8
00:04:02,225 --> 00:04:05,891
One day a couple came to adopt a child
from ‘Gayathri Illam’, our orphanage.

9
00:04:21,725 --> 00:04:22,725
You unlucky girl!

10
00:04:22,891 --> 00:04:24,058
I’ll kill you.

11
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:28,725
When they were about to leave she pleaded
with us not to send Banu with them.

12
00:04:29,058 --> 00:04:31,558
She said she had a vision
of them torturing Banu.

13
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:34,600
I didn’t understand why
she behaved that way.

14
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:36,641
Later, everything turned out
just the way she saw it.

15
00:04:36,808 --> 00:04:39,850
We rescued Banu with
police help.

16
00:04:40,183 --> 00:04:44,225
Ever since then, there are times when with just
a touch she can foresee dangers for people.

17
00:04:44,558 --> 00:04:46,350
I was worried and took
her to the doctor.

18
00:04:46,683 --> 00:04:50,725
He said she is going through a paranormal
experience of getting visuals beyond time.

19
00:04:51,266 --> 00:04:54,225
He said it was difficult to understand this.
But that’s the reality we had to face.

20
00:04:54,725 --> 00:04:56,850
I didn’t know if it was a
boon or a curse for her.

21
00:04:57,141 --> 00:05:01,683
Was this going to put her in danger or would
someone else be in danger because of this?

22
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,433
Hey, where are you going?

23
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,641
What is it, Mani?

24
00:05:42,808 --> 00:05:45,100
You borrowed money from our
boss, Kailasam. Won’t you return it?

25
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:46,600
I am going to do just that.

26
00:05:46,683 --> 00:05:50,308
As soon as I get paid for this job
that I am going for, I will repay it.

27
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:51,183
Let me go.

28
00:05:51,683 --> 00:05:53,350
Leave your bike behind.
–Why?

29
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,600
All right. Keep it.

30
00:06:00,141 --> 00:06:01,183
Stay here.

31
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:03,308
I’ll be back with the money.
Keep an eye on it for me.

32
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,016
You’ll be back, won’t you?
- I will.

33
00:06:12,141 --> 00:06:13,891
Whose bike is that?
– Who knows?

34
00:06:14,058 --> 00:06:14,933
I’ll be back.

35
00:07:33,641 --> 00:07:37,183
Look for him.
Where did he go?

36
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:03,600
Here we go!

37
00:08:03,808 --> 00:08:04,891
Come, Chinna.

38
00:08:05,016 --> 00:08:06,058
How do you have so
much money?

39
00:08:06,183 --> 00:08:07,558
I worked hard for it.

40
00:08:07,808 --> 00:08:10,850
He wouldn’t have worked for it.
He must have whacked someone for it.

41
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:12,100
Start the game.

42
00:08:12,266 --> 00:08:13,725
Looks like you’re going
to lose it all.

43
00:08:14,016 --> 00:08:15,475
I am going to get it all back
in one game.

44
00:08:15,475 --> 00:08:16,183
Deal the cards.

45
00:08:16,266 --> 00:08:17,975
Why…are you going to
repay all your debts?

46
00:08:18,266 --> 00:08:20,641
Rubbish! Does anyone
ever repay their debts?

47
00:08:20,975 --> 00:08:23,350
My hero's film (Actor Ajith a.k.a. Thala)
is releasing in three days.

48
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:25,100
We have to make it a gala affair.

49
00:08:25,308 --> 00:08:30,641
I’ll be serving the tastiest ‘Biriyani’
made with the finest ‘Basmati’ rice.

50
00:08:30,641 --> 00:08:31,891
I need money for that.

51
00:08:31,933 --> 00:08:35,308
Throw in the money.

52
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,016
Brother Subbiah…

53
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,225
I am coming.

54
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:48,183
Didn't you want someone reliable from
here to get your job done in Chennai?

55
00:08:48,641 --> 00:08:53,141
There's Chinna. If he beats up someone,
no one will ever find out

56
00:08:54,891 --> 00:08:56,350
He doesn’t come across like that.

57
00:08:56,641 --> 00:08:59,683
He seems like someone
who only knows to flirt.

58
00:09:04,391 --> 00:09:06,475
I have a Rummy.

59
00:09:08,641 --> 00:09:09,891
You’re one lucky guy.

60
00:09:09,891 --> 00:09:10,933
We’ve lost.

61
00:09:16,933 --> 00:09:18,266
Lend me Rs.2000.

62
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:19,475
Give me what you already
owe me.

63
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,350
Brother, can you give
me Rs.2000?

64
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,016
Don’t lend him any money.
He’s never repaid anyone.

65
00:09:24,141 --> 00:09:25,225
Wait, I am coming.

66
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:27,558
Brother Subbiah…

67
00:09:27,975 --> 00:09:28,891
He was here...

68
00:10:05,933 --> 00:10:07,475
We've hired that cycle.
Put it down.

69
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:09,808
Fabulous acting!

70
00:10:11,058 --> 00:10:12,641
Anitha, answer and then go.

71
00:10:12,808 --> 00:10:13,600
Get lost.

72
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:16,391
How could you do this, mother?

73
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:19,433
I didn’t let you feel the
absence of your parents.

74
00:10:19,766 --> 00:10:23,350
Just marrying you doesn’t make
him a worthy husband.

75
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:30,225
I worked hard to educate you and to get you
married. Look what you’ve done!

76
00:10:30,308 --> 00:10:33,641
By lending me his surname,
he may be considered my father...

77
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:37,641
...but by torturing you he's
my enemy forever.

78
00:10:38,058 --> 00:10:40,641
You’re dating a guy despite
knowing he’s my enemy.

79
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:43,850
Look here! If you meet
him again…

80
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:44,891
This is what I am looking for.

81
00:10:44,891 --> 00:10:45,558
Give it to me.

82
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,016
I will kill you in the blink
of an eye.

83
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:03,266
What are you doing?

84
00:11:03,516 --> 00:11:05,975
Have you ever professed your
love to me so romantically?

85
00:11:07,641 --> 00:11:12,225
I was acting.
How was it?

86
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:13,475
It was good.

87
00:11:14,225 --> 00:11:15,516
You were roaring away here.

88
00:11:15,558 --> 00:11:17,100
Why don’t you have the courage
to speak to your father?

89
00:11:18,183 --> 00:11:19,641
Look here, Mr. Fruit Salad!

90
00:11:19,891 --> 00:11:25,350
It is my destiny to become
a big star.

91
00:11:26,516 --> 00:11:30,350
The moment he hears I want to become an actor,
he explodes like a firecracker!

92
00:11:32,141 --> 00:11:36,058
I’ll tell him when the time
is right.

93
00:11:43,891 --> 00:11:47,808
Give me the courage to speak
my mind about going to Chennai.

94
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:48,975
Karthik...

95
00:11:49,266 --> 00:11:51,100
Father…
-Come here.

96
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:55,225
You have to leave for
Chennai tomorrow.

97
00:11:55,516 --> 00:11:56,350
I can’t believe this, father.

98
00:11:56,391 --> 00:11:57,808
I wanted to talk to you
about the very same thing.

99
00:11:58,225 --> 00:12:00,225
Great minds think alike!

100
00:12:00,558 --> 00:12:04,350
Meet a man called
Ramamurthy in Mylapore.

101
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:07,141
I want to start another
branch there.

102
00:12:07,516 --> 00:12:09,850
I want you to finalise that.

103
00:12:11,141 --> 00:12:14,308
I want to go to Chennai to
become an actor.

104
00:12:16,225 --> 00:12:19,975
I don’t want to run a business.
I am not good at it.

105
00:12:21,016 --> 00:12:23,100
It doesn’t motivate me.

106
00:12:23,558 --> 00:12:26,100
Cut the crap! He wants to act.

107
00:12:26,558 --> 00:12:29,475
He’s making me angry.

108
00:12:29,558 --> 00:12:31,308
Don’t yell.
It’s embarrassing.

109
00:12:31,683 --> 00:12:35,183
You want to go and beg around
to become an actor?

110
00:12:35,266 --> 00:12:36,350
Isn’t that shameful?

111
00:12:38,225 --> 00:12:41,100
We have been running this
store for three generations.

112
00:12:41,641 --> 00:12:43,308
You have to take over.

113
00:12:43,558 --> 00:12:46,350
Instead you want to become an actor.

114
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:50,391
Mr. Shanmugam!

115
00:12:50,725 --> 00:12:51,641
Come out of the house.

116
00:12:53,016 --> 00:12:54,558
What happened?
-Nothing.

117
00:12:55,266 --> 00:12:56,850
Mr. Fruit Salad!

118
00:12:58,058 --> 00:12:59,350
What are you doing here, Deepa?

119
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:04,058
Why are you behaving so
disrespectfully?

120
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:05,850
You don’t know how to respect others.

121
00:13:05,891 --> 00:13:07,016
Why should you be respected?

122
00:13:08,308 --> 00:13:09,725
People are watching.

123
00:13:09,808 --> 00:13:12,225
Don’t embarrass me.
Go home.

124
00:13:13,308 --> 00:13:14,516
Now you know how it feels.

125
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,016
This is how embarrassed he was when
you yelled at him in front of everyone.

126
00:13:19,225 --> 00:13:20,058
Please keep quiet.

127
00:13:20,516 --> 00:13:24,433
You may be scared of him.
I am not.

128
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,350
Keep quiet, Deepa.

129
00:13:26,516 --> 00:13:29,558
Leave home with just your boxers on,
we'll make it in life.

130
00:13:29,933 --> 00:13:32,016
Why don’t you go with her?

131
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,183
No, father…

132
00:13:33,475 --> 00:13:34,391
How did you fall for this girl?

133
00:13:35,475 --> 00:13:36,683
Is this how your parents raised you?

134
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:38,516
They raised me just fine.

135
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,850
You’re the one stopping
your son’s rise.

136
00:13:41,183 --> 00:13:43,183
I am doing what you
should be doing.

137
00:13:43,725 --> 00:13:47,225
Look at him. He has talent
in abundance!

138
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:50,725
When he becomes a star,
you’ll want to show-off.

139
00:13:50,725 --> 00:13:53,850
You’ll make him endorse your
products to sell more of them.

140
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:55,100
See what I do then.

141
00:13:55,183 --> 00:13:56,933
As if his face will sell anything!

142
00:13:57,016 --> 00:13:58,058
Can you keep quiet?

143
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,475
I am fighting for you.

144
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:02,183
What is it now?

145
00:14:02,266 --> 00:14:02,933
Apologise to him.

146
00:14:03,016 --> 00:14:05,891
Apologise to my own son?

147
00:14:05,933 --> 00:14:08,391
Apologise for yelling at
him and I’ll go.

148
00:14:08,725 --> 00:14:11,391
My dear Karthik...

149
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:16,350
My heartfelt apologies for all the wrong
I’ve done and for having yelled at you!

150
00:14:16,433 --> 00:14:17,016
Will that do?

151
00:14:17,766 --> 00:14:19,350
You don’t have to overdo it.

152
00:14:20,183 --> 00:14:22,475
I am sorry too for having yelled at you.

153
00:14:22,808 --> 00:14:24,225
Now she apologises!

154
00:14:31,225 --> 00:14:32,141
Where is brother Subbiah?

155
00:14:32,391 --> 00:14:34,058
He is upstairs. Go up.

156
00:14:38,475 --> 00:14:39,183
What is it?

157
00:14:42,808 --> 00:14:44,308
I want some money.

158
00:14:44,391 --> 00:14:45,641
To gamble?

159
00:14:45,641 --> 00:14:46,475
Not for that.

160
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:48,933
My hero's movie is about
to release.

161
00:14:48,933 --> 00:14:51,725
I need money for the
celebrations.

162
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:54,308
Sounds good!

163
00:14:54,641 --> 00:14:59,350
There is no more money due to you.
I’ve paid you for everything.

164
00:15:02,058 --> 00:15:06,308
It’s my hero's movie. It'll be shameful
if I don’t make it a gala affair.

165
00:15:09,183 --> 00:15:10,725
Bring that box.

166
00:15:18,766 --> 00:15:20,183
That will do, brother.

167
00:15:21,266 --> 00:15:22,850
This is the only debt I'll be repaying.

168
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,766
I don’t want it. Keep it.

169
00:15:26,808 --> 00:15:29,141
It’s going to be a rocking celebration!

170
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:03,016
"We are the Thoothukudi dudes!"

171
00:16:03,058 --> 00:16:06,683
"Like the sea breeze,
we waft across carefree and cool."

172
00:16:06,725 --> 00:16:10,725
"I am going to dance up a storm."

173
00:16:10,725 --> 00:16:13,975
"I am going to star in a
hundred movies."

174
00:16:14,266 --> 00:16:17,933
"Hey, did you think money’s
nothing?"

175
00:16:17,933 --> 00:16:21,350
"With a handful, one will
be on top of the world."

176
00:16:21,475 --> 00:16:25,141
"Come along and don
a new role."

177
00:16:25,183 --> 00:16:28,600
"Come along and sing a song."

178
00:17:06,016 --> 00:17:09,558
"I want to be rich and famous, I want to be
on those posters donkeys feed on."

179
00:17:09,725 --> 00:17:13,100
"The day Tinseltown rolls out the
red carpet for me…"

180
00:17:13,141 --> 00:17:16,558
"...is when Life would have opened
heaven’s doors for me."

181
00:17:17,141 --> 00:17:20,558
"Borrow to the brink
and make everyone sink."

182
00:17:20,891 --> 00:17:24,183
"When they chase you for
their money..."

183
00:17:24,225 --> 00:17:27,891
"...all they’ll get is my dirty
worn clothes, honey."

184
00:17:28,225 --> 00:17:34,850
"My lucky stars will help me
scale great heights."

185
00:17:35,558 --> 00:17:38,975
"A box and a few boxers is
all the wealth I have."

186
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:46,141
"Lord Muruga’s spear leads me
to brighter days."

187
00:18:08,891 --> 00:18:15,808
"Lord Muruga’s spear leads me
to brighter days."

188
00:18:16,141 --> 00:18:19,516
"I am going to dance up a storm."

189
00:18:19,683 --> 00:18:23,350
"I am going to star in a
hundred movies."

190
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:27,058
"Hey, did you think money’s
nothing?"

191
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:30,475
"With a handful, one will be on top
of the world."

192
00:18:30,725 --> 00:18:34,350
"Come along and don
a new role."

193
00:18:34,391 --> 00:18:37,850
"Come along and sing a song."

194
00:18:41,891 --> 00:18:42,766
Stop throwing stones at me.

195
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:48,183
Stop throwing stones at me.

196
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:51,391
Just because I didn’t clear the debt,
you can’t hang me upside down.

197
00:18:52,225 --> 00:18:53,975
Blood is rushing to my head.

198
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:56,058
Get me down.
I’ll give you your money.

199
00:18:57,516 --> 00:18:58,516
Slow!

200
00:19:09,058 --> 00:19:11,058
The boss has given us
strict orders.

201
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:11,683
What has he said?

202
00:19:11,766 --> 00:19:13,350
He doesn’t want us to go
back without the money.

203
00:19:13,683 --> 00:19:15,350
If I had the money I would
give it to you.

204
00:19:15,558 --> 00:19:17,391
Take your hands off me.

205
00:19:18,308 --> 00:19:21,391
Look, I don't have much.
Just Rs.150.

206
00:19:24,933 --> 00:19:26,850
Those are tickets for my hero's movie.
Give them back.

207
00:19:27,058 --> 00:19:29,600
He’s got tickets for a whole week.

208
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:34,141
He doesn’t care to return our money
but he’s got himself a week’s tickets.

209
00:19:34,266 --> 00:19:36,725
Don’t mess with the tickets.
I’m warning you.

210
00:20:02,183 --> 00:20:03,016
Why did you hit him?

211
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,391
He tore my tickets.

212
00:20:09,558 --> 00:20:10,350
He’s dead.

213
00:20:10,433 --> 00:20:12,100
He won’t be dead.

214
00:20:12,225 --> 00:20:13,558
Sprinkle some soda or beer
on him. He’ll wake up.

215
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,683
I am telling you he’s dead.

216
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:17,350
It was just a slap!

217
00:20:17,558 --> 00:20:18,725
How dare you!

218
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:21,683
Don’t touch me.

219
00:20:27,683 --> 00:20:30,558
How dare you throw a
stone at me?

220
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,725
Run.

221
00:20:41,808 --> 00:20:44,600
He had the guts to hit him despite
knowing he's my man?

222
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:48,100
He said Kailasam was no
big shot and threw a stone at me.

223
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,225
Get him wherever he is.

224
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:52,683
Will do that…

225
00:20:53,141 --> 00:20:54,850
I'll stone him to death.

226
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:00,183
Hey, come here.

227
00:21:06,391 --> 00:21:07,350
Where are you going?

228
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:08,683
I am going to elope.

229
00:21:14,141 --> 00:21:16,433
These are your clothes.

230
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,350
Here’s some money.

231
00:21:18,433 --> 00:21:19,225
Why do I need this?

232
00:21:19,641 --> 00:21:20,558
You’re leaving for Chennai now.

233
00:21:21,433 --> 00:21:23,766
Right now?
Don’t play the fool.

234
00:21:23,891 --> 00:21:25,016
I can’t leave right away.

235
00:21:25,183 --> 00:21:26,933
Do you trust me?
–Yes.

236
00:21:27,183 --> 00:21:29,183
Do you have faith in your talent?
–Yes.

237
00:21:29,225 --> 00:21:31,766
Don’t you know your father is stupid?
–He is.

238
00:21:32,058 --> 00:21:33,391
I haven't informed anyone.

239
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,975
They are not going to give you
a farewell anyway.

240
00:21:36,058 --> 00:21:37,475
You can inform them when
you make it big.

241
00:21:37,641 --> 00:21:39,975
My friend Ramya knows
someone called Loghu.

242
00:21:40,016 --> 00:21:41,600
He’s an influential man in
the movie world.

243
00:21:41,766 --> 00:21:43,058
He’s a bigger photographer
than I am.

244
00:21:43,141 --> 00:21:45,891
Go meet him.
It’s getting late. Go.

245
00:21:47,308 --> 00:21:48,433
How did you get this money?

246
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:53,225
I sold my jewels and emptied
my father’s cash box.

247
00:21:54,808 --> 00:21:56,350
How can you do this?

248
00:21:56,683 --> 00:21:57,891
Don’t you have any
desires of your own?

249
00:21:58,141 --> 00:22:02,850
I do. I want you to come back as
a big star and make me proud.

250
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:04,350
That's all I wish for.

251
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:12,225
Let’s not get into these melodramatic
moments. It’s getting late. Go.

252
00:22:12,266 --> 00:22:12,891
Wait.

253
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,933
The ticket is in your pocket.

254
00:22:24,475 --> 00:22:26,391
Idiot!

255
00:22:26,558 --> 00:22:28,766
You've worked for the gangs here...

256
00:22:29,433 --> 00:22:31,725
But now you’ve killed one of them.
How will they spare you?

257
00:22:33,058 --> 00:22:34,766
They have called me twice already.

258
00:22:36,475 --> 00:22:37,975
I can’t handle this anymore.

259
00:22:38,058 --> 00:22:40,600
What will I do if you
abandon me?

260
00:22:41,141 --> 00:22:42,141
Leave town immediately.

261
00:22:42,516 --> 00:22:43,558
Where will I go?

262
00:22:43,558 --> 00:22:44,350
Go to Chennai.

263
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:46,850
I don’t know anyone there.

264
00:22:47,308 --> 00:22:49,808
I know a man who’s a manager
there. His name is Mark.

265
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,266
I’ll give you his number.
Call him.

266
00:22:52,308 --> 00:22:53,350
He’ll help you.

267
00:23:00,516 --> 00:23:01,433
Tea with lots of sugar…

268
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:12,266
There he is!

269
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:14,850
Get him.

270
00:23:24,475 --> 00:23:25,350
Where did he go?

271
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:27,141
Look there.

272
00:24:32,766 --> 00:24:35,683
…I’ve left home against
my father’s wishes.

273
00:24:35,683 --> 00:24:40,933
Stand by me till I make it
big as an actor somehow.

274
00:24:43,433 --> 00:24:45,391
Is this a sign?

275
00:24:49,808 --> 00:24:50,725
That's not good.

276
00:24:51,225 --> 00:24:55,808
Anyway, they say seeing a funeral
procession is a good sign.

277
00:25:28,266 --> 00:25:30,475
Things have worked out for the best.

278
00:25:30,475 --> 00:25:32,850
You don't have to worry about earning
a bad name anymore.

279
00:25:33,141 --> 00:25:35,391
Your brother chose the wrong path.

280
00:25:35,975 --> 00:25:37,558
That led him to his death.

281
00:25:38,016 --> 00:25:41,516
It’s not easy to earn
a reputation like yours.

282
00:25:42,433 --> 00:25:50,308
I am sure your business supports
close to 4000 families.

283
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:52,808
That’s why I had a word
with our leader.

284
00:25:53,391 --> 00:25:57,266
I’ve told him the Party will benefit if someone like
you becomes an MLA. (Member of the Legislative Assembly)

285
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:03,141
The MLA nominations are
due in 10 days.

286
00:26:03,391 --> 00:26:06,391
Don’t worry about anything.
Just focus on what you need to do.

287
00:26:06,933 --> 00:26:11,975
If you work hard for the Party,
you will rise in the ranks.

288
00:26:43,225 --> 00:26:44,725
Where can I find Loghu?

289
00:26:46,641 --> 00:26:48,350
Strike a pose like Salman Khan.

290
00:26:52,933 --> 00:26:55,391
Who are you?

291
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,850
I am Karthik, I spoke to
you on the phone.

292
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:58,350
Which Karthik?

293
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,433
Deepa’s friend.
Didn’t Ramya tell you?

294
00:27:01,308 --> 00:27:04,683
Oh! The friend’s friend’s friend!

295
00:27:05,225 --> 00:27:06,225
What is it?

296
00:27:06,641 --> 00:27:09,850
I’ve come to Chennai to
become a hero.

297
00:27:10,391 --> 00:27:11,225
I am a terrific actor.

298
00:27:11,766 --> 00:27:12,516
Not happening!

299
00:27:12,808 --> 00:27:16,225
Can you strike another
pose, please?

300
00:27:17,391 --> 00:27:19,891
Deepa says that with your
recommendation, I will get a break.

301
00:27:21,183 --> 00:27:24,266
You don't stand a chance.

302
00:27:29,266 --> 00:27:29,808
Stand there.

303
00:27:30,516 --> 00:27:31,308
Strike a pose.

304
00:27:32,266 --> 00:27:33,808
You stay where you are.

305
00:27:39,183 --> 00:27:42,183
Don’t go in person.
Just send your photos.

306
00:27:42,266 --> 00:27:44,141
You look tolerable only in a photo.

307
00:28:06,391 --> 00:28:08,600
Brother Subbiah told me
to help you.

308
00:28:08,975 --> 00:28:10,600
He never said anything else.

309
00:28:10,641 --> 00:28:11,891
He didn’t?

310
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,725
I’ll be direct.

311
00:28:14,766 --> 00:28:17,641
You want to meet the ‘party’.
That’s not possible.

312
00:28:17,725 --> 00:28:19,850
The ‘party’ is too busy.
Where should I send the ‘party’?

313
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:24,266
What are you saying, Mark?

314
00:28:25,933 --> 00:28:28,350
Someone like you calls me.

315
00:28:28,391 --> 00:28:29,516
I then send my ‘party’ across.

316
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,225
When the job’s done, that
‘party’ will call me...

317
00:28:32,225 --> 00:28:34,600
...and then I will send that
‘party’ to another 'party'.

318
00:28:34,766 --> 00:28:36,391
It’s a very busy life.

319
00:28:36,975 --> 00:28:39,391
What kind of a ‘party’ do
you want?

320
00:28:52,058 --> 00:28:52,850
How are the photos?

321
00:28:53,475 --> 00:28:54,350
Deepa took them.

322
00:28:56,766 --> 00:28:58,100
With and without a moustache.

323
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,391
With and without a beard.

324
00:29:00,391 --> 00:29:03,058
I did ask you to send only
your pictures.

325
00:29:03,058 --> 00:29:07,475
But with these pictures you won't
even become a sidekick.

326
00:29:07,475 --> 00:29:10,391
What are you saying, Logo?
-It’s Loghu.

327
00:29:10,808 --> 00:29:15,725
Take the 7 pm bus and go home.

328
00:29:16,891 --> 00:29:20,600
If you’re Ok, I can send the
‘party’ right away.

329
00:29:21,391 --> 00:29:22,475
Are you a pimp?

330
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:24,808
Is this the ‘party’ you were
referring to?

331
00:29:26,141 --> 00:29:27,933
Did brother Subbiah come
to Chennai for this?

332
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:30,933
I am in trouble already,
this is the last thing I need.

333
00:29:30,975 --> 00:29:32,433
What trouble are you in?

334
00:29:32,808 --> 00:29:34,058
It’s nothing. Let it be.

335
00:29:34,558 --> 00:29:36,516
Come on.
Don't feel shy.

336
00:29:37,141 --> 00:29:39,016
I just killed someone in
Thoothukudi.

337
00:29:40,308 --> 00:29:41,433
Shall we drink tea?

338
00:29:42,641 --> 00:29:44,183
Give me a cup of tea with
lots of sugar.

339
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:48,100
Give me a cup of tea with
little sugar.

340
00:29:49,558 --> 00:29:51,058
You are a big photographer.

341
00:29:51,141 --> 00:29:52,391
You know a lot of people
in cinema.

342
00:29:52,391 --> 00:29:55,225
A lot of important people
know you.

343
00:29:55,391 --> 00:29:57,808
Deepa told me you’ll get
me a chance somehow.

344
00:29:58,683 --> 00:30:08,058
Let’s give your face a makeover and shoot
an awesome portfolio for Rs.10,000.

345
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:12,350
If it doesn’t come out well, don’t ask me.
It’s up to you after that.

346
00:30:13,183 --> 00:30:15,558
Rs.10,000 is too much.

347
00:30:15,725 --> 00:30:17,683
Can you do this for half
the money?

348
00:30:17,766 --> 00:30:20,391
For half the money, you get
half the face, is that Ok?

349
00:30:22,725 --> 00:30:25,058
For Deepa’s sake
and for friendship's sake...

350
00:30:25,141 --> 00:30:26,475
I'll do it for you.

351
00:30:28,141 --> 00:30:31,141
Will people come looking for
you from Thoothukudi?

352
00:30:31,141 --> 00:30:34,891
Yes. I thought I would hang around here for a few days
and then head somewhere else.

353
00:30:34,891 --> 00:30:36,183
What should I do?

354
00:30:39,891 --> 00:30:44,016
Run away from here the way you
ran away from Thoothukudi.

355
00:30:47,391 --> 00:30:50,308
You’ve been referred by
brother Subbiah.

356
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:56,141
I know someone.
I’ll take you to him.

357
00:30:56,141 --> 00:31:00,350
Don’t discuss the Thoothukudi
issue with him.

358
00:31:05,433 --> 00:31:09,391
I asked you for tea but you’ve
given me sugar syrup.

359
00:31:10,808 --> 00:31:12,975
There’s no sugar in this.

360
00:31:13,975 --> 00:31:14,933
I am sorry.

361
00:31:14,933 --> 00:31:18,100
His tea has gone to you
and yours to him.

362
00:31:19,058 --> 00:31:21,308
Can I get you another one?
- Give it to him.

363
00:31:21,558 --> 00:31:22,850
Let’s go and meet your guy.

364
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:24,766
I’ll get you another one
right away.

365
00:31:25,391 --> 00:31:27,766
It’s all right.

366
00:31:39,933 --> 00:31:40,850
Hi, baby.

367
00:31:42,641 --> 00:31:44,141
I need to send a small parcel.

368
00:31:44,266 --> 00:31:45,183
Is brother Joe there?

369
00:31:45,183 --> 00:31:47,933
Don’t you dare call me ‘baby’!

370
00:31:48,016 --> 00:31:49,100
Move aside.

371
00:31:50,266 --> 00:31:51,558
I know her well.

372
00:31:53,766 --> 00:31:54,808
Which parcel are you
going to send?

373
00:31:54,808 --> 00:31:57,225
You’re the parcel.
I am going to send you.

374
00:31:58,891 --> 00:32:00,308
Hello, brother.

375
00:32:05,766 --> 00:32:07,683
How was last night?

376
00:32:07,766 --> 00:32:08,766
What is it?

377
00:32:08,766 --> 00:32:10,308
He is a friend.

378
00:32:10,391 --> 00:32:12,391
He’s had a little trouble in
his hometown.

379
00:32:12,391 --> 00:32:15,516
I want to deport him to another country.
I am here for that.

380
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,016
Sit down.

381
00:32:17,766 --> 00:32:19,308
You told me not to talk
about Thoothukudi.

382
00:32:19,308 --> 00:32:20,933
I know what to say.

383
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:23,016
What’s your name?

384
00:32:23,016 --> 00:32:23,725
Chinna.

385
00:32:24,058 --> 00:32:29,100
If I decide to, I can send you to any
country you see on this map.

386
00:32:29,391 --> 00:32:33,725
You choose the country
and I can send you there.

387
00:32:36,891 --> 00:32:37,433
Here.

388
00:32:37,891 --> 00:32:39,016
25 lakhs.

389
00:32:40,766 --> 00:32:41,391
What about this?

390
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:42,808
30 lakhs.

391
00:32:43,183 --> 00:32:44,183
I don’t want all that.

392
00:32:44,391 --> 00:32:45,308
I’ll go there.

393
00:32:46,058 --> 00:32:51,100
That’s the sea. Are you going to
dance with a mermaid over there?

394
00:32:53,141 --> 00:32:57,391
You suggest a good place
that’s not too expensive.

395
00:32:58,683 --> 00:32:59,766
Malaysia it is.

396
00:33:00,141 --> 00:33:01,683
That will be 2 lakhs.

397
00:33:01,725 --> 00:33:02,433
What do you say?

398
00:33:05,225 --> 00:33:08,558
It’s not easy to fabricate papers
and send a person to a foreign country.

399
00:33:09,225 --> 00:33:11,933
Give me Rs. 50,000 as advance.

400
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:18,933
Give it to him.

401
00:33:19,016 --> 00:33:20,933
I don’t have money.

402
00:33:21,058 --> 00:33:23,516
I’ll return it when we go back
to the room. Give it to him now.

403
00:33:23,766 --> 00:33:25,100
You must return it.

404
00:33:25,141 --> 00:33:27,308
It is the client’s money.
–I will.

405
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:35,225
This is Rs.30,000.

406
00:33:35,308 --> 00:33:38,808
Come to ‘Rohini lodge’ at 8 pm, we’ll adjust
the balance in return for a few services.

407
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:40,016
Rest of the money?

408
00:33:40,183 --> 00:33:42,683
Once the job is done I'll
give it to you.

409
00:33:42,725 --> 00:33:43,808
Who will guarantee that?

410
00:33:44,975 --> 00:33:46,933
Me?
He will kill me.

411
00:33:47,475 --> 00:33:48,850
Ask anyone in Thoothukudi.

412
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:51,350
I don’t owe a paisa to anyone.
Do you know that?

413
00:34:03,058 --> 00:34:06,141
"I will rise after every fall."

414
00:34:46,391 --> 00:34:47,225
"Crazy fellow!"

415
00:34:49,391 --> 00:34:50,891
"I’ll make you feel small."

416
00:34:50,933 --> 00:34:53,058
"I can get you into trouble and
you won’t even know."

417
00:34:53,058 --> 00:34:56,100
"I ain’t getting trapped in
any inquiry."

418
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,558
"I am the benevolent, fearless one."

419
00:34:57,558 --> 00:34:59,100
"I will make you run."

420
00:35:01,225 --> 00:35:03,850
"I will rise after every fall."

421
00:35:09,016 --> 00:35:11,516
"Don’t you understand that not
every day can be sunny?"

422
00:35:11,516 --> 00:35:13,808
"Throw away your worry."

423
00:35:13,933 --> 00:35:16,141
"Bro, tell me what you gonna do."

424
00:35:16,141 --> 00:35:18,891
"Fool, you can’t blame somebody
for your failure."

425
00:35:18,933 --> 00:35:22,475
"It’s alright to fade away like the moon.
But rise like the sun again."

426
00:35:23,933 --> 00:35:27,391
"Like a rocket,
let’s thrust into space."

427
00:35:28,183 --> 00:35:30,683
"Life is like a roller coaster with
its ups and downs."

428
00:35:30,683 --> 00:35:33,141
"We have to brave the storm,
we won’t stop."

429
00:35:33,183 --> 00:35:35,808
"I’ll laugh aloud when I give
fate a run for its money."

430
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:38,225
"I will overcome any obstacle
in my path."

431
00:35:38,641 --> 00:35:40,725
"I’ll say it a hundred times and
yet ‘you won’t get it’."

432
00:35:40,725 --> 00:35:43,141
"I’ll just finish it and say ‘I did it’."

433
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:45,308
"Bro, go around town and
tell them who we are."

434
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:47,183
"They will tremble when they
hear my name."

435
00:35:50,641 --> 00:35:52,975
"I will rise after every fall."

436
00:36:06,725 --> 00:36:09,225
He resembles the man
I saw in Thoothukudi.

437
00:36:34,016 --> 00:36:35,725
Who is it at this hour?

438
00:36:38,725 --> 00:36:41,016
Sir, how can you expect the job
to be done immediately?

439
00:36:44,808 --> 00:36:49,725
There is a good sign.
Consider your job done.

440
00:36:58,433 --> 00:36:59,391
Where is he?

441
00:37:23,225 --> 00:37:24,391
Why are you following me?

442
00:37:24,475 --> 00:37:25,600
Aren’t you from Thoothukudi?

443
00:37:25,850 --> 00:37:27,475
I am from T. Nagar.

444
00:37:27,641 --> 00:37:28,891
How many of you are here?

445
00:37:28,891 --> 00:37:30,100
I am the only one.

446
00:37:31,475 --> 00:37:32,141
Tell me the truth.

447
00:37:32,225 --> 00:37:33,725
Don’t you know what happened
at Thoothukudi?

448
00:37:33,933 --> 00:37:36,975
I don’t even know what is
happening here.

449
00:37:37,641 --> 00:37:39,141
Why are you following me then?

450
00:37:39,308 --> 00:37:39,933
Don’t stab me.

451
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:43,225
Subbiah from Thoothukudi
told me about you.

452
00:37:43,891 --> 00:37:46,558
You could have told me that
before being beaten up.

453
00:37:46,641 --> 00:37:47,933
You didn’t let me!

454
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:50,725
You twisted my neck even before
I could utter a word.

455
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:54,350
I'll never know what you'll do
behind my back. Come here.

456
00:37:55,183 --> 00:37:57,516
Why pounce on a
weak man like me?

457
00:37:57,891 --> 00:37:59,350
Heartless guy!

458
00:38:00,433 --> 00:38:03,016
Let that go.
What do you want?

459
00:38:04,558 --> 00:38:06,391
Here’s your tea with lots of sugar.

460
00:38:11,766 --> 00:38:13,683
We have to get rid of somebody.

461
00:38:15,183 --> 00:38:16,391
Who do you think I am?

462
00:38:16,683 --> 00:38:17,600
I can’t do that.

463
00:38:18,808 --> 00:38:21,183
I’m looking for someone
who is not from Chennai.

464
00:38:21,475 --> 00:38:23,808
It’s a serious task.

465
00:38:24,475 --> 00:38:26,141
That’s why I followed you
and caught hold of you.

466
00:38:26,641 --> 00:38:32,058
If you breathe a word about me being here,
you’ll have your neck twisted forever.

467
00:38:32,141 --> 00:38:33,725
I can’t do that. Get lost.

468
00:38:35,141 --> 00:38:36,600
You’re going to miss out
on 5 lakhs.

469
00:38:39,391 --> 00:38:40,225
How much was that?

470
00:38:45,808 --> 00:38:48,183
Five lakhs just to break bones?

471
00:38:49,016 --> 00:38:52,725
If it were that simple I would do it
myself and take the money.

472
00:38:52,725 --> 00:38:54,766
You have to kill the person.

473
00:38:55,850 --> 00:38:56,766
I have to kill someone?

474
00:38:56,891 --> 00:38:58,891
Haven’t you ever killed anyone?

475
00:38:59,141 --> 00:39:01,891
You killed someone unknowingly,
and had to flee from your hometown.

476
00:39:01,933 --> 00:39:04,641
But here, you murder someone
knowingly and you’ll get paid for it.

477
00:39:05,683 --> 00:39:07,891
You said you didn’t know what
happened at Thoothukudi.

478
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:09,475
Tell me.

479
00:39:11,391 --> 00:39:15,433
He wants me to kill someone.
I've only beaten up people until now...

480
00:39:19,058 --> 00:39:20,683
Here’s an advance of 2 lakhs.

481
00:39:23,891 --> 00:39:26,433
All right.
Who is the person?

482
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:33,266
I must be the only one who gives
business to a person who beats me up.

483
00:39:34,266 --> 00:39:36,391
Why did you run into me?

484
00:39:36,391 --> 00:39:37,725
Say ‘sorry’ before you go.

485
00:39:39,516 --> 00:39:40,891
Why should I?

486
00:39:40,975 --> 00:39:42,141
You watch where you’re going.

487
00:39:42,266 --> 00:39:43,766
You are asking me to apologise!

488
00:39:49,016 --> 00:39:51,350
This was not planned.
It happened all of a sudden.

489
00:39:51,433 --> 00:39:52,433
Hey, holy man.

490
00:39:52,475 --> 00:39:53,225
Take this young man with you.

491
00:39:53,266 --> 00:39:54,100
Holy man?

492
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:56,433
Is this conversation more important
than the commitment?

493
00:40:05,016 --> 00:40:07,641
Why have you brought me
to a hospital?

494
00:40:07,641 --> 00:40:08,683
Don’t say a word.

495
00:40:08,725 --> 00:40:10,058
Keep a 10 feet distance
from me.

496
00:40:10,225 --> 00:40:12,725
The first person I speak to
is your ‘mark’.

497
00:40:12,933 --> 00:40:14,891
‘Mark’? I know him already.

498
00:40:15,766 --> 00:40:17,308
‘Mark’ means the concerned party.

499
00:40:17,308 --> 00:40:19,100
Even I know that Mark
means the ‘party’.

500
00:40:19,308 --> 00:40:20,516
You’re confusing me.

501
00:40:20,558 --> 00:40:23,266
I’ll show you the target.

502
00:40:28,058 --> 00:40:29,641
Keep a 10 feet distance…

503
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:32,766
10 feet…

504
00:40:43,933 --> 00:40:45,516
I’ve been looking everywhere.

505
00:40:45,516 --> 00:40:47,058
Please tell me where this ward is.

506
00:40:48,683 --> 00:40:51,850
Five lakhs to kill this old lady?

507
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:54,516
Give it a week and she’ll
die on her own.

508
00:40:54,516 --> 00:40:57,475
Are your nerves frayed?
Can’t you speak?

509
00:41:02,475 --> 00:41:03,891
Not this one.

510
00:41:44,891 --> 00:41:46,850
How are you now?
-I am all right.

511
00:41:48,391 --> 00:41:51,225
Can I say something if you
don’t mind.

512
00:41:52,391 --> 00:41:56,850
You didn’t get hurt because
you fell. Someone hit you. Don’t lie.

513
00:41:56,891 --> 00:42:01,433
Her husband hit her and
tortured her.

514
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:04,933
Here's the plan.

515
00:42:05,266 --> 00:42:09,266
I'll follow her for a few days,
understand her routine.

516
00:42:09,475 --> 00:42:12,058
And then fix the right time
and place to kill her.

517
00:42:12,266 --> 00:42:14,058
I need a bike to follow her.

518
00:42:14,058 --> 00:42:15,308
Give me money.

519
00:42:16,391 --> 00:42:17,641
It's a 'low budget' killing.

520
00:42:17,891 --> 00:42:20,225
He has so much cash and yet
he pesters me for more.

521
00:42:20,475 --> 00:42:24,308
Here are my keys.
I’ll hitch a ride back home.

522
00:42:25,683 --> 00:42:27,266
You don’t have to live
in hell like this.

523
00:42:28,225 --> 00:42:29,350
Move aside.

524
00:42:43,391 --> 00:42:46,641
Go back with your mother.
Don’t go back to your husband’s house.

525
00:42:46,725 --> 00:42:49,391
We'll be in more trouble.

526
00:42:49,766 --> 00:42:55,183
Listen to me. If you send her with him,
you’ll never see her alive.

527
00:42:55,225 --> 00:42:56,933
What are you saying?

528
00:42:57,975 --> 00:43:01,266
Meenamma, I saw her in flames.

529
00:43:02,933 --> 00:43:05,725
Take your daughter home.

530
00:43:06,225 --> 00:43:09,141
She's warning you because
she had a vision. Listen to her.

531
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:13,766
Go with your mother.

532
00:43:49,225 --> 00:43:51,641
Darling Swetha!

533
00:43:52,183 --> 00:43:55,558
Why are you ignoring me,
darling?

534
00:43:55,850 --> 00:43:57,600
Who the hell is he?

535
00:44:20,016 --> 00:44:20,891
Swetha...

536
00:44:20,891 --> 00:44:22,600
I am talking to you and
you’re just walking away.

537
00:44:22,641 --> 00:44:23,516
What?

538
00:44:24,225 --> 00:44:27,350
'Baldie', have you assigned the
same job to two of us?

539
00:44:27,350 --> 00:44:32,183
Why are you complaining?
I’ve given you money and my bike.

540
00:44:32,391 --> 00:44:34,600
Why would I do such a thing?

541
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:37,100
This looks like something else.

542
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:38,058
Hang up.

543
00:44:41,766 --> 00:44:43,891
Swetha, one moment…

544
00:44:43,891 --> 00:44:46,100
I have a call from Virat Kohli...

545
00:44:54,683 --> 00:44:57,475
Hello, Swetha.
That’s my number. Save it.

546
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:59,475
If you fall head over heels in love
with me, give me a 'missed call'.

547
00:44:59,475 --> 00:45:00,391
I’ll call back.

548
00:45:01,058 --> 00:45:02,641
How did you get my number?

549
00:45:02,725 --> 00:45:05,350
I called the hospital and
told them I was dying.

550
00:45:05,683 --> 00:45:07,766
Delete my number from
your phone.

551
00:45:10,516 --> 00:45:11,600
Delete it.

552
00:45:11,850 --> 00:45:12,725
Are you on WhatsApp?

553
00:45:12,766 --> 00:45:13,558
Can I send you a photo?

554
00:45:13,641 --> 00:45:15,266
Do you know whose
house that is?

555
00:45:15,266 --> 00:45:16,975
She’s pointing this way.
Has she seen me?

556
00:45:16,975 --> 00:45:18,766
It is the assistant commissioner’s house.
He’s my uncle’s friend.

557
00:45:18,766 --> 00:45:20,058
They play badminton together.

558
00:45:20,058 --> 00:45:21,558
Do you want to play too?

559
00:45:22,266 --> 00:45:26,016
You look beautiful when
you do that.

560
00:45:26,475 --> 00:45:27,975
Can you leave this place
right now?

561
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:29,516
I am leaving.
Save my number.

562
00:45:29,516 --> 00:45:32,016
Call me if you see me in your dreams,
even if it’s a nightmare.

563
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:58,850
This is the scene.
Rehearse it.

564
00:45:59,266 --> 00:46:00,933
What's your surname?
-Shanmugam.

565
00:46:08,058 --> 00:46:11,350
Why did he cut the call again?
Could he be in trouble?

566
00:46:11,766 --> 00:46:12,766
Definitely.

567
00:46:13,183 --> 00:46:14,183
But you’re the one in trouble.

568
00:46:14,391 --> 00:46:18,808
Listen, we should always
keep the boys in fear.

569
00:46:19,350 --> 00:46:20,683
Or else, they'll take us
for granted.

570
00:46:21,891 --> 00:46:23,350
My Karthik is not like that.

571
00:46:23,725 --> 00:46:26,433
I thought the same of my Raju.

572
00:46:26,975 --> 00:46:28,058
Look at what happened.

573
00:46:28,683 --> 00:46:34,975
He went to Madurai to study, found
another girl there and bid me goodbye.

574
00:46:35,516 --> 00:46:38,766
After Raju, it was Dinesh and
I am finally with Selva now.

575
00:46:54,016 --> 00:46:55,975
Karthik Shanmugam...

576
00:46:57,058 --> 00:46:58,016
Lights.

577
00:46:58,766 --> 00:46:59,975
Yugesa, give him the cue.

578
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:03,933
Do you know your lines?
-I do.

579
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:05,975
You’re Ashwin.
That’s Renuka.

580
00:47:06,058 --> 00:47:09,725
The two of you are in love and
you’re going to breakup.

581
00:47:10,183 --> 00:47:11,683
You have to convince her.

582
00:47:14,850 --> 00:47:18,558
Ashwin, I’ve waited too long.
I can’t take it anymore.

583
00:47:18,891 --> 00:47:21,225
Let’s end everything.

584
00:47:21,266 --> 00:47:22,975
What are you saying, Renu?

585
00:47:23,308 --> 00:47:25,891
That’s the one thing I didn’t
want to hear from you.

586
00:47:28,183 --> 00:47:29,016
Why are you shouting?

587
00:47:30,016 --> 00:47:31,266
That girl is going to leave you.

588
00:47:32,016 --> 00:47:33,516
I want to see more emotion.

589
00:47:34,016 --> 00:47:36,308
Convince her.
Do you understand?

590
00:47:37,141 --> 00:47:38,850
Give me 10 seconds.

591
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:08,683
Let’s end everything.

592
00:48:12,433 --> 00:48:15,350
Let’s breakup.
All the best, Karthik.

593
00:48:15,891 --> 00:48:16,766
Deepa...

594
00:48:18,266 --> 00:48:20,808
How can you say that you’ll
leave me?

595
00:48:21,725 --> 00:48:25,225
If you leave me,
my courage will be gone.

596
00:48:25,516 --> 00:48:28,766
If you leave me,
my confidence will be gone.

597
00:48:32,183 --> 00:48:37,100
If you leave me, it’s as good as me
deserting my own self.

598
00:48:38,475 --> 00:48:40,058
I will lose everything, Deepa.

599
00:49:04,516 --> 00:49:07,016
He has said ‘cut’.
Let me go now.

600
00:49:13,183 --> 00:49:14,891
Was it good?
-It was good.

601
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:17,725
I know, sir.
I saw you observing me.

602
00:49:19,225 --> 00:49:22,183
The name of the character is Renuka.
Who is Deepa?

603
00:49:22,725 --> 00:49:25,516
Oh, my God!
I messed up.

604
00:49:25,558 --> 00:49:26,725
Let me do it again.

605
00:49:26,808 --> 00:49:28,475
No need. It was good.

606
00:49:30,016 --> 00:49:33,183
Sir, please show this to the director when
he is in a great mood.

607
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:33,933
Definitely.

608
00:49:34,350 --> 00:49:37,683
Sir, this is my life.
Please don’t forget.

609
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:39,308
Thank you, sir.

610
00:50:01,891 --> 00:50:07,766
I was very disturbed after the sudden
death of my younger brother.

611
00:50:08,183 --> 00:50:09,725
You tried saying something to me...

612
00:50:10,016 --> 00:50:12,016
I didn’t respond well.

613
00:50:12,850 --> 00:50:16,641
Hope you’ve not taken
it to heart.

614
00:50:16,933 --> 00:50:18,766
No, not at all.

615
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:21,350
Don’t keep things to yourself.

616
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:23,350
You can speak your mind
to me.

617
00:50:24,058 --> 00:50:25,183
There’s nothing like that.

618
00:50:25,683 --> 00:50:28,683
If I want to tell you something,
I will.

619
00:50:31,433 --> 00:50:32,475
Brother…

620
00:50:34,933 --> 00:50:38,516
I’ve been noticing this the last few days.
Why are you following her?

621
00:50:39,933 --> 00:50:40,975
I am not.

622
00:50:42,141 --> 00:50:42,933
What do you want?

623
00:50:43,016 --> 00:50:44,350
Do you know who I am?
-I don’t. Tell me.

624
00:50:44,350 --> 00:50:46,308
Do you know who my uncle is?
Do you know ‘Otteri’ Durai?

625
00:50:46,475 --> 00:50:48,975
Is he an important guy there?
-See, you know!

626
00:50:49,058 --> 00:50:50,475
He is a gangster...

627
00:50:50,725 --> 00:50:53,100
…and my uncle.
So, what does that make me?

628
00:50:54,891 --> 00:50:56,058
I am a gangster too!

629
00:50:57,766 --> 00:51:00,308
I am a bad guy myself.
I’ve even killed someone.

630
00:51:00,308 --> 00:51:03,141
I am having a serious conversation
and you’re trying to kiss my nose!

631
00:51:03,225 --> 00:51:04,933
I am madly in love with her,
like in the movies.

632
00:51:05,850 --> 00:51:07,100
Get lost!
You can have her.

633
00:51:07,766 --> 00:51:10,891
You’ve given up!
Are you scared?

634
00:51:11,558 --> 00:51:14,933
If I see you following her one
more time, I’ll kill you.

635
00:51:15,016 --> 00:51:17,850
You can call anyone you want for support!
I’ve seen this in the movies too.

636
00:51:22,433 --> 00:51:26,600
'Baldie', I might have to kill another guy.
Be ready with more cash.

637
00:51:27,683 --> 00:51:30,266
I asked you to kill only one person.
Who is the other one?

638
00:51:30,266 --> 00:51:32,891
An idiot is following her.
What else do I do?

639
00:51:33,641 --> 00:51:37,266
He is looking for ways to
make more money.

640
00:51:37,725 --> 00:51:41,141
Think of it as a festival offer
and kill two for the price of one.

641
00:51:41,141 --> 00:51:42,891
A festival offer?

642
00:51:43,516 --> 00:51:46,100
Do you expect me to wait patiently
while you take your own sweet time?

643
00:51:46,183 --> 00:51:48,766
I want this done quickly
but you keep ondragging it.

644
00:51:48,808 --> 00:51:52,350
Don’t take me for a fool.
Respond!

645
00:52:19,350 --> 00:52:22,350
Sleep, my darling.

646
00:52:28,183 --> 00:52:29,308
Wake up, idiot.

647
00:52:33,808 --> 00:52:34,975
Deepa...

648
00:52:35,058 --> 00:52:36,891
You neither call nor
answer my calls.

649
00:52:37,308 --> 00:52:38,933
I was planning to call you.

650
00:52:39,433 --> 00:52:41,766
Didn't you have money to top-up your card?
I would have done it.

651
00:52:41,975 --> 00:52:44,183
I had the money.
How did you come here?

652
00:52:44,683 --> 00:52:47,475
I made friends with the manager.

653
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:54,725
Tell me.

654
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:57,266
Why are you looking at your phone?

655
00:52:57,725 --> 00:52:58,641
It is nothing.

656
00:52:59,558 --> 00:53:00,308
Tell me the truth.

657
00:53:01,183 --> 00:53:02,725
I wanted to see if someone
had called me.

658
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:05,225
Karthik...

659
00:53:05,308 --> 00:53:08,350
Is there another girl in your life?

660
00:53:08,558 --> 00:53:11,141
Have you gone crazy?

661
00:53:11,183 --> 00:53:12,433
There’s no one else.

662
00:53:12,558 --> 00:53:13,975
Why are you so suspicious?

663
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:15,225
Why didn’t you call me?

664
00:53:16,808 --> 00:53:19,850
It looks like an argument.
Are you breaking up?

665
00:53:20,683 --> 00:53:24,600
Deepa, I told him if he didn’t call,
you’ll leave him.

666
00:53:26,225 --> 00:53:27,225
Get lost!

667
00:53:27,308 --> 00:53:33,266
Deepa, every time you call me
I have nothing good to tell you.

668
00:53:33,516 --> 00:53:35,058
I was feeling bad.

669
00:53:35,933 --> 00:53:37,975
I am waiting for some
good news.

670
00:53:38,266 --> 00:53:39,141
What news?

671
00:53:39,183 --> 00:53:42,725
I am waiting for the results
of an audition.

672
00:53:42,933 --> 00:53:44,266
Really?

673
00:53:45,350 --> 00:53:46,600
That won’t happen.

674
00:53:46,891 --> 00:53:51,141
People are struggling out here. Will you
get a part with just one great performance?

675
00:53:51,350 --> 00:53:53,850
It's not practical.
Put some sense into him, Deepa.

676
00:53:53,891 --> 00:53:55,975
Hey, ‘negative print’.
Get lost.

677
00:53:58,391 --> 00:53:59,766
Do you believe him?

678
00:54:00,766 --> 00:54:02,683
I thought only you were
going back.

679
00:54:02,725 --> 00:54:05,516
It looks like the two of you
will go back together.

680
00:54:15,766 --> 00:54:24,808
"Hey, gorgeous,
I am swayed by your beauty."

681
00:54:26,183 --> 00:54:35,850
"Your inviting lips make me swoon."

682
00:54:36,725 --> 00:54:41,391
"Your face is as luminous as
a thousand moons."

683
00:54:41,766 --> 00:54:46,641
"To touch you, to hold you…
my heart yearns."

684
00:54:47,016 --> 00:54:51,766
"Wherever you go,
I will follow you."

685
00:54:51,933 --> 00:54:55,766
"Won’t you kill me softly
with your love?"

686
00:54:57,183 --> 00:55:02,600
"At sundown, your thoughts sway
at the corner of my heart."

687
00:55:02,808 --> 00:55:07,350
"I see you in the twilight
glow of the sky. "

688
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:33,100
"In my very own private pathway,
like my shadow, you pursue me."

689
00:55:33,141 --> 00:55:44,183
"In a world where I languish alone,
are you the newfound love who will yearn for me?"

690
00:55:48,516 --> 00:55:51,183
"What’s happened to me?"

691
00:55:51,183 --> 00:55:53,975
"My days have turned upside down."

692
00:55:54,183 --> 00:55:59,100
"Am I the lover waiting for
his last chance?"

693
00:55:59,808 --> 00:56:09,891
"The unfathomable mix of joy
and grief in my heart has turned me crazy."

694
00:56:10,725 --> 00:56:15,516
"With a single kiss she
sweetened my life."

695
00:56:15,891 --> 00:56:19,766
"From the corner of my eye
I see you fleeting by."

696
00:56:20,141 --> 00:56:22,141
"Everything has changed."

697
00:56:22,391 --> 00:56:24,808
"Everything seems new."

698
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:30,516
"How best to share this feeling,
I don’t know?"

699
00:56:32,433 --> 00:56:34,058
"Who are you, girl?"

700
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:37,891
"Strong as a rock from within.
But soft as a flower outside."

701
00:56:37,975 --> 00:56:42,391
"My joy doubles in your love."

702
00:56:42,725 --> 00:56:44,308
"Who are you, girl?"

703
00:56:44,308 --> 00:56:48,141
"Strong as a rock from within.
But soft as a flower outside."

704
00:56:48,183 --> 00:56:52,641
"My joy doubles in your love."

705
00:57:44,433 --> 00:57:46,683
How are you,
brother Subbiah?

706
00:57:46,725 --> 00:57:51,100
Haven’t you left yet? Thangamani is
worried you won’t finish his work.

707
00:57:51,391 --> 00:57:54,141
I am working on the plan.
I will finish it soon.

708
00:57:54,308 --> 00:57:57,225
Kailasam is still mad at you, Chinna.

709
00:57:57,308 --> 00:58:00,975
If he finds you, he will finish
you before you finish your work.

710
00:58:01,391 --> 00:58:04,266
Finish fast and leave town
at the earliest.

711
00:58:04,308 --> 00:58:06,141
Don’t get caught.

712
00:58:09,516 --> 00:58:12,058
Should I come with you?
-Why are you saying such things?

713
00:58:12,641 --> 00:58:14,766
It doesn’t look like
I’ll get a break.

714
00:58:15,016 --> 00:58:17,725
Even though I am brave,
I am scared I’ll lose.

715
00:58:18,183 --> 00:58:20,183
How will you lose?

716
00:58:20,516 --> 00:58:22,183
You’ll lose only when you
don’t try.

717
00:58:22,350 --> 00:58:23,433
But you’ve been trying.

718
00:58:23,516 --> 00:58:26,183
No matter what happens,
I am with you.

719
00:58:26,516 --> 00:58:29,766
I’ll be there if you lose,
I’ll be there if you win.

720
00:58:29,850 --> 00:58:32,225
Even if you commit murder,
I am with you.

721
00:58:32,516 --> 00:58:34,558
Don’t confuse yourself
unnecessarily.

722
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:36,641
Whatever it is, call me.

723
00:58:37,308 --> 00:58:38,516
Do you get it?

724
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:44,516
Daya, you said some ‘Vaathi’ was going to
board a bus? I can’t see anyone.

725
00:58:45,350 --> 00:58:50,850
The guy in the checkered shirt wearing
an ugly pair of trousers, that’s him.

726
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:54,183
We’ve got to kidnap him
before he boards the bus.

727
00:58:55,016 --> 00:58:56,725
It has to look casual.

728
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:10,183
Karthik, this is Srini, director
Surya’s associate.

729
00:59:10,225 --> 00:59:11,391
Please tell me, sir.

730
00:59:11,850 --> 00:59:14,183
I've been waiting for your call.

731
00:59:15,725 --> 00:59:19,433
The director liked your
audition the best.

732
00:59:19,516 --> 00:59:22,516
He wants to see you in person.
Will you come to the studio tomorrow?

733
00:59:23,016 --> 00:59:24,475
Sure, sir.
I will be there.

734
00:59:24,516 --> 00:59:26,016
Thank you, sir.

735
00:59:27,266 --> 00:59:28,183
Deepa...

736
00:59:28,266 --> 00:59:29,308
He is on the move.

737
00:59:30,016 --> 00:59:30,933
My knife!

738
00:59:33,391 --> 00:59:35,308
Won’t you watch where
you’re going? Idiot!

739
00:59:40,308 --> 00:59:41,516
What happened now?

740
00:59:45,391 --> 00:59:46,391
I got a call.

741
00:59:48,308 --> 00:59:51,975
The director likes my screen test
and wants to see me.

742
00:59:52,433 --> 00:59:53,183
What does that mean?

743
00:59:53,558 --> 00:59:54,850
I think I’ve been selected.

744
01:00:01,683 --> 01:00:05,225
Are you going to romance the
whole day? Get off immediately.

745
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:14,350
Did you find it?

746
01:00:14,433 --> 01:00:16,183
No, Daya.
'Vaathi’ has gone.

747
01:00:16,391 --> 01:00:17,558
Has he gone?

748
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:19,725
Go, look.

749
01:00:21,641 --> 01:00:23,350
I am sorry, brother.

750
01:00:23,516 --> 01:00:25,933
I was overjoyed and I just
bumped into you.

751
01:00:25,933 --> 01:00:26,766
Looks like you’ve lost
something.

752
01:00:26,808 --> 01:00:27,725
Can I help you look for it?

753
01:00:27,975 --> 01:00:33,600
We’ll handle it.
You can go.

754
01:00:33,641 --> 01:00:36,308
Is it all right?
-Yes. Go.

755
01:01:00,391 --> 01:01:02,516
It’s blazing hot.

756
01:01:03,308 --> 01:01:07,183
All right. Pretend you’re
that girl. Stand here.

757
01:01:07,558 --> 01:01:09,391
That girl?
Why?

758
01:01:09,725 --> 01:01:12,183
I am going to use you for
the rehearsal.

759
01:01:12,266 --> 01:01:15,975
This is a public place.
Don’t kiss me here.

760
01:01:16,058 --> 01:01:17,933
Don’t you want your money?
– I do.

761
01:01:17,975 --> 01:01:19,808
Then, stand here.
– All right.

762
01:01:24,141 --> 01:01:25,433
I have to do this to get
my money!

763
01:01:40,808 --> 01:01:44,725
It’s not a kiss…?
A stab?

764
01:01:45,641 --> 01:01:48,016
He’s walking away heartlessly.

765
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:50,516
Was all this about killing someone?

766
01:01:50,683 --> 01:01:52,891
I am just a small-time
rogue.

767
01:01:53,016 --> 01:01:54,266
They’ll spare a murderer.

768
01:01:54,308 --> 01:01:56,516
They’ll never spare the
accomplice.

769
01:01:56,975 --> 01:01:59,975
I thought I would get your papers
ready and pack you off.

770
01:02:00,183 --> 01:02:02,725
But it looks like I am the one
who’s going to be packed off.

771
01:02:02,766 --> 01:02:04,558
Hey, you...
-Is he your friend?

772
01:02:04,641 --> 01:02:06,808
I am a gangster.
Believe me.

773
01:02:07,058 --> 01:02:10,266
I am a ‘stylish’ gangster.
I am talking to you. Wait.

774
01:02:10,308 --> 01:02:12,475
Hello, boss. What’s your problem?
Tell me.

775
01:02:12,725 --> 01:02:16,058
Haven't I already warned you
not to follow my girl?

776
01:02:16,141 --> 01:02:21,225
Oh, that babe! I am trying to set her up
for my friend. She’s not for you.

777
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:22,475
Damn it!

778
01:02:23,725 --> 01:02:25,766
Press my hand.

779
01:02:26,100 --> 01:02:29,475
What are you saying?
She is such a kind soul.

780
01:02:29,475 --> 01:02:30,850
Why are you picking your ears?

781
01:02:31,100 --> 01:02:32,308
Attack him.

782
01:02:32,391 --> 01:02:33,641
Faster!

783
01:02:50,683 --> 01:02:54,183
Ouch! My legs!
My hands!

784
01:03:11,183 --> 01:03:15,433
Superb, mind-blowing, outstanding,
extraordinary, you can call it anything!

785
01:03:15,725 --> 01:03:19,016
When I see good performers,
I simply fall in love with them.

786
01:03:19,058 --> 01:03:21,766
I liked you the moment
I saw you.

787
01:03:22,308 --> 01:03:23,641
Thank you, sir.

788
01:03:23,891 --> 01:03:27,266
It’s a personal question.
Are you in love?

789
01:03:27,641 --> 01:03:29,308
Yes, sir. She lives in my
hometown.

790
01:03:29,433 --> 01:03:33,766
That is why you are able to relate to it
and bring it out in your acting.

791
01:03:33,891 --> 01:03:35,433
You’re madly in love?
-Yes, sir.

792
01:03:37,350 --> 01:03:41,058
The search for my movie's
new face ends here.

793
01:03:41,058 --> 01:03:45,516
I have a star actor. You are going
to play the second lead along with him.

794
01:03:50,725 --> 01:03:52,641
People back home will be
very happy, sir.

795
01:03:52,850 --> 01:03:54,433
I know.
-Thank you, sir.

796
01:03:54,516 --> 01:03:56,225
Don’t make a big deal of it.

797
01:03:56,641 --> 01:03:57,850
This is important.

798
01:03:57,975 --> 01:04:01,975
June 18...That's the day the movie
will be launched.

799
01:04:02,350 --> 01:04:06,308
I'll introduce you to the world in
a very big way on that day.

800
01:04:06,641 --> 01:04:09,558
Most importantly,
keep a low profile till then.

801
01:04:09,975 --> 01:04:17,058
I want to create enough hype about
you and then present you to everyone.

802
01:04:17,433 --> 01:04:20,266
Sir, his name is also Karthik…

803
01:04:21,141 --> 01:04:24,975
Karthik, the industry has two actors
with the same name.

804
01:04:25,141 --> 01:04:26,600
Can we change your name?

805
01:04:29,308 --> 01:04:32,516
Sir, my mother chose this name for me.
I didn’t want to change it.

806
01:04:33,516 --> 01:04:36,350
We get sentimental about
our mothers.

807
01:04:37,183 --> 01:04:40,141
Who better than a mother
to name a child?

808
01:04:40,225 --> 01:04:41,683
Let’s not change your name.

809
01:04:42,725 --> 01:04:44,808
We’ll just call you ‘Little’ Karthik.

810
01:04:44,850 --> 01:04:46,933
‘Little’ Karthik...
Ok, sir.

811
01:04:47,975 --> 01:04:52,266
‘Little’ Karthik is the name
of S.J. Surya’s new hero.

812
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:19,850
Hey, ‘Baldie’.

813
01:05:20,308 --> 01:05:23,433
June 18...That’s when I am
going to kill her.

814
01:05:24,141 --> 01:05:26,683
At last! I'm relieved.

815
01:05:26,808 --> 01:05:28,475
When and how are you
going to do it?

816
01:05:28,641 --> 01:05:30,433
I’ve done my groundwork.

817
01:05:30,766 --> 01:05:34,016
I can’t kill her near her hostel.
The police commissioner stays close by.

818
01:05:34,475 --> 01:05:36,766
The cops are around always.
-You can’t do that.

819
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:39,350
Wherever she goes,
she always has company.

820
01:05:39,350 --> 01:05:40,183
That’s a problem.

821
01:05:40,308 --> 01:05:42,475
But, I found the right place.
-Where?

822
01:05:42,475 --> 01:05:47,183
She always visits a patient and returns
alone to her hostel through a market.

823
01:05:47,350 --> 01:05:49,391
I am going to kill her at
the market.

824
01:05:50,975 --> 01:05:53,225
Super!
-Thank you.

825
01:05:53,641 --> 01:05:58,933
But the market is always crowded.
If someone spots you, both of us will be finished.

826
01:05:58,933 --> 01:05:59,933
How will I get caught?

827
01:06:00,225 --> 01:06:03,600
I will be in disguise.
That is my speciality.

828
01:06:04,933 --> 01:06:06,683
Disguise?
How will you go there?

829
01:06:06,766 --> 01:06:08,975
Just do what I say.

830
01:06:09,225 --> 01:06:12,433
I want a vehicle to be at the
Five Lights teashop at 8 am.

831
01:06:12,808 --> 01:06:14,891
Send me a driver who
doesn’t know me.

832
01:06:14,891 --> 01:06:17,766
Keep a knife below the mat
of the backseat.

833
01:06:17,975 --> 01:06:21,141
As soon as my work is done,
I will get away in the same car.

834
01:06:21,141 --> 01:06:23,308
We’ll become strangers from
that moment on.

835
01:06:23,308 --> 01:06:28,100
Anyway, we’re not related.
Make sure you finish the work.

836
01:06:28,683 --> 01:06:31,183
Hey, Baldie!
-What is it?

837
01:06:31,308 --> 01:06:36,183
That girl looks good,
why are you trying to kill her?

838
01:06:36,725 --> 01:06:38,975
What’s the problem?

839
01:06:39,558 --> 01:06:41,725
Her good looks are the problem.

840
01:06:41,766 --> 01:06:46,100
She always appears in my dreams
and smiles at me.

841
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:47,850
Consider the job done.

842
01:06:48,225 --> 01:06:49,641
What are you saying?

843
01:06:49,766 --> 01:06:53,475
Ten days before my grandma's death,
she appeared in my dreams and kept smiling at me.

844
01:06:53,725 --> 01:06:57,641
And on the eleventh day she died.
This girl will die too.

845
01:06:58,141 --> 01:06:59,600
Don’t get confused unnecessarily.

846
01:06:59,683 --> 01:07:01,183
Big shots are involved.
Give me the date again.

847
01:07:01,225 --> 01:07:01,975
June 18…

848
01:07:02,016 --> 01:07:04,891
Don’t lose focus.
Say it after me…

849
01:07:53,141 --> 01:07:53,975
Tell me.

850
01:07:54,100 --> 01:07:55,475
Have you left?

851
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:56,641
I am leaving.

852
01:07:56,808 --> 01:08:00,558
I don’t want the police to get wind
of what we’re doing.

853
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:01,808
I’ve come here to pray.

854
01:08:02,016 --> 01:08:03,100
We could get killed.

855
01:08:04,100 --> 01:08:05,850
Don’t keep calling me.

856
01:08:06,141 --> 01:08:08,475
If you call me again,
it will get messed up by itself.

857
01:08:08,558 --> 01:08:09,975
Don’t ask me to return your
money then.

858
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:16,600
Hello, Deepa.

859
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:17,725
Do you know where I am now?

860
01:08:18,016 --> 01:08:19,016
Where?

861
01:08:19,100 --> 01:08:22,350
I am at the temple offering prayers
for ‘Little’ Karthik’s success.

862
01:08:22,558 --> 01:08:23,683
You’re going to rock.

863
01:08:23,808 --> 01:08:24,933
Super!

864
01:08:42,183 --> 01:08:43,808
Sir, I am the driver sent by the
‘cinema’ company.

865
01:08:44,016 --> 01:08:45,058
Tell me, brother.

866
01:08:45,058 --> 01:08:46,975
Sir, I can’t find the place.

867
01:08:47,058 --> 01:08:49,100
Do you know the teashop at Five Lights?
-I do, sir.

868
01:08:49,100 --> 01:08:50,433
Wait there. I am coming.

869
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:38,933
Aren’t you the man sent
by ‘Baldie’?

870
01:09:38,975 --> 01:09:42,183
‘Baldie’? Is that how you
call the manager?

871
01:09:42,308 --> 01:09:43,183
Get in, brother.

872
01:09:43,350 --> 01:09:45,183
Manager?
Anyway, start the car.

873
01:09:55,933 --> 01:09:58,516
Don’t forget to recommend me,
if they need a photographer.

874
01:09:58,850 --> 01:10:03,475
Certainly. Your photographs
have been lucky for me.

875
01:10:05,058 --> 01:10:07,058
You’re the only one who
thinks I bring luck.

876
01:10:07,308 --> 01:10:11,100
Thangamani asked me to go
to the teashop at Five Lights. Where is he?

877
01:10:19,266 --> 01:10:21,183
My car has come.
I am leaving.

878
01:10:22,725 --> 01:10:24,183
Let's think positive, Ok?

879
01:10:25,641 --> 01:10:27,100
Did you find the place, brother?

880
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:51,600
This guy gets to be a hero?

881
01:10:51,766 --> 01:10:56,683
I am glad you gave me an easy landmark.
We keep coming to this teashop.

882
01:10:56,725 --> 01:10:59,475
I didn’t ask you anything.
Just drive.

883
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:00,975
I am already tense.

884
01:11:01,016 --> 01:11:03,016
Are you worried because it is going to be
your first experience?

885
01:11:03,016 --> 01:11:04,641
Don't worry.
You’ll get used to it.

886
01:11:04,975 --> 01:11:06,516
Have you been doing this
for long?

887
01:11:06,641 --> 01:11:09,308
For around 10-15 years.

888
01:11:09,850 --> 01:11:11,933
Pick up.
Finish the job. Drop back.

889
01:11:12,183 --> 01:11:14,266
Pick up.
Finish the job. Drop back.

890
01:11:22,308 --> 01:11:24,183
Hello.
-Hey, Thangamani.

891
01:11:24,266 --> 01:11:25,350
Tell me, driver?

892
01:11:25,350 --> 01:11:28,433
He doesn’t look like the person
you mentioned. He looks totally different.

893
01:11:28,558 --> 01:11:32,183
Wow! Does he look different?
That is his speciality.

894
01:11:32,350 --> 01:11:34,766
He looks like another person altogether.

895
01:11:43,183 --> 01:11:45,600
Don't talk unnecessarily.

896
01:11:45,683 --> 01:11:48,808
Just drop him off and bring him back.
No questions asked.

897
01:11:51,891 --> 01:11:52,891
Tell me, sir.

898
01:11:52,933 --> 01:11:54,516
Murugan, have you picked him up?

899
01:11:54,891 --> 01:11:56,683
We’ve left.
We’ll be there.

900
01:11:56,808 --> 01:12:00,725
Don’t bring him in through
the main entrance. Use the rear one.

901
01:12:01,308 --> 01:12:04,391
I told him not to call again.
Look at the road and drive.

902
01:12:06,641 --> 01:12:10,058
So arrogant even before becoming a star!
What if he becomes one?

903
01:12:15,683 --> 01:12:16,850
What is it now?

904
01:12:16,933 --> 01:12:19,850
You know what, the driver is
unable to recognise you.

905
01:12:19,975 --> 01:12:22,141
That fool calls you a fool.

906
01:12:22,725 --> 01:12:26,558
Looks like a great disguise!
Just take a selfie and 'WhatsApp' it.

907
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:28,308
Let me admire it.

908
01:12:28,308 --> 01:12:33,100
Baldie, did you call the driver
to check on me?

909
01:12:33,975 --> 01:12:35,891
One more call and
I’ll just run away.

910
01:12:35,891 --> 01:12:40,433
I just wanted to share my happiness.
March on, my warrior prince!

911
01:12:46,183 --> 01:12:49,683
Don’t tell him I called you,
he’ll yell.

912
01:12:49,891 --> 01:12:53,266
Just tell him his stuff is
under the mat.

913
01:12:56,683 --> 01:12:58,808
Look under the mat.

914
01:13:01,975 --> 01:13:02,766
What is it?

915
01:13:04,433 --> 01:13:05,475
Let me look for it...

916
01:13:06,391 --> 01:13:07,350
Did you miss something?

917
01:13:09,850 --> 01:13:13,433
This is what I found.
What's it for, brother?

918
01:13:13,433 --> 01:13:16,100
It’s for you.
You’ll need it at the spot.

919
01:13:16,391 --> 01:13:17,641
At the spot...

920
01:13:18,516 --> 01:13:22,516
Looks like the first shot after the launch is
a racy fight sequence!

921
01:13:42,183 --> 01:13:43,350
Where did he keep it?

922
01:13:45,058 --> 01:13:46,641
Where is it?

923
01:13:47,016 --> 01:13:51,475
My job is only to pick you up and
after the job, drop you back.

924
01:13:51,808 --> 01:13:53,891
For anything else,
ask them.

925
01:13:55,933 --> 01:13:57,225
‘Baldie’ goofed up.

926
01:14:13,308 --> 01:14:15,558
The boy I’ve hired will
finish his job today.

927
01:14:15,641 --> 01:14:19,725
If I get the balance, I will keep
some and pay him the rest.

928
01:14:25,891 --> 01:14:31,558
What if your boy by mistake leaks out
information about you...

929
01:14:31,808 --> 01:14:33,433
I’ll be finished.

930
01:14:36,766 --> 01:14:41,558
Three of my men will be
on watch at the market.

931
01:14:42,183 --> 01:14:45,141
The moment your boy kills the girl,
my men will kill him.

932
01:14:45,516 --> 01:14:48,016
That's it.
We don’t have to pay him.

933
01:14:54,141 --> 01:14:55,141
What about my payment?

934
01:15:00,558 --> 01:15:01,641
I’ll give it to you.

935
01:15:38,641 --> 01:15:42,766
I don't see a traffic signal...
Brother, why have we stopped?

936
01:15:43,308 --> 01:15:46,141
Don't you remember?
This is the spot.

937
01:15:46,433 --> 01:15:48,058
I don't.
Only you should know.

938
01:15:49,350 --> 01:15:50,516
My hero's cut-out...

939
01:15:51,891 --> 01:15:52,933
Where are you going?

940
01:15:53,016 --> 01:15:54,266
To the cinema studio.

941
01:15:54,266 --> 01:15:55,808
Studio?
-Yes.

942
01:15:57,391 --> 01:15:58,808
Aren’t you Thangamani’s guy?

943
01:15:59,225 --> 01:16:00,808
No, I am from the cinema
company.

944
01:16:00,850 --> 01:16:02,016
Cinema...

945
01:16:02,016 --> 01:16:03,350
Is my hero here?

946
01:16:08,891 --> 01:16:12,641
God! Who's put up more banners
for my hero than me?

947
01:16:12,933 --> 01:16:15,308
Why didn't you take my calls?

948
01:16:16,641 --> 01:16:17,975
Where is Karthik?

949
01:16:19,475 --> 01:16:21,641
Who are you?
How did you get into this car?

950
01:16:21,850 --> 01:16:23,391
This is not the guy you are
supposed to bring.

951
01:16:23,391 --> 01:16:27,516
I called the number you gave,
picked him up and dropped him here.

952
01:16:27,558 --> 01:16:29,391
You brought the wrong guy.

953
01:16:31,641 --> 01:16:33,225
So, I got into the wrong car...

954
01:16:34,225 --> 01:16:36,308
My hero is expected here...

955
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:38,683
I also have to kill that girl...

956
01:16:41,141 --> 01:16:43,975
Ditch it... I'll kill her tomorrow.
Let me meet my hero now.

957
01:16:44,350 --> 01:16:46,391
You’re making a blockbuster
with Thala.

958
01:16:46,391 --> 01:16:49,308
Then, why do you need a newbie?
Why the suspense?

959
01:16:49,391 --> 01:16:53,433
The story demands it.
You will be surprised when you see him.

960
01:16:54,058 --> 01:16:55,891
My choice is never wrong.

961
01:17:07,058 --> 01:17:08,516
Listen to me. Please go.

962
01:17:08,558 --> 01:17:11,141
Madam, just one photo.
I have put up cut-outs for him.

963
01:17:11,975 --> 01:17:12,558
Sir...

964
01:17:12,683 --> 01:17:15,391
Bunch of idiots!

965
01:17:18,516 --> 01:17:20,225
Fools!

966
01:17:21,808 --> 01:17:23,183
Fools!

967
01:17:23,933 --> 01:17:26,808
Damn! The event begins in 30 minutes.
I have boasted about the new guy to everyone.

968
01:17:26,933 --> 01:17:28,975
People are waiting.
What do we do?

969
01:17:28,975 --> 01:17:30,225
Who the hell have you brought?

970
01:17:30,308 --> 01:17:32,516
He’s the one who got into
the wrong car.

971
01:17:37,308 --> 01:17:40,641
Sir, this is not the same guy...
-You told me that already, stop confusing me.

972
01:17:40,766 --> 01:17:43,933
Did you call him?
-He is not reachable.

973
01:17:46,266 --> 01:17:48,350
Can we call off the function?

974
01:17:48,475 --> 01:17:52,141
We can’t do that.

975
01:17:52,391 --> 01:17:55,266
It's a prestigious project.

976
01:18:01,516 --> 01:18:03,433
We have a good story.

977
01:18:04,266 --> 01:18:06,391
The Thala (head) is already in place.

978
01:18:08,350 --> 01:18:09,808
The tail is all we need.

979
01:18:11,225 --> 01:18:13,350
Where is the tail?

980
01:18:16,683 --> 01:18:18,475
Sir, can I see my hero just once.

981
01:18:26,850 --> 01:18:29,600
Surya sir, I’ve watched your movies.

982
01:18:29,933 --> 01:18:31,350
They’re very good.

983
01:18:36,516 --> 01:18:41,183
Give me just 2 minutes to take
a picture with my hero.

984
01:18:43,266 --> 01:18:45,350
Your fate is about to change.

985
01:18:45,516 --> 01:18:48,850
You are going to play the second lead
in my film with your hero.

986
01:18:49,308 --> 01:18:51,725
Me?
With my hero?

987
01:18:54,225 --> 01:18:55,975
Sir...that’s too risky.

988
01:18:56,058 --> 01:18:57,225
Chuck it.

989
01:18:57,225 --> 01:19:00,808
We have a good story, we have the head,
we’ve found the tail. We’ll rock!

990
01:19:01,641 --> 01:19:07,975
All you have to do is some tinkering, welding, painting
on his face and bring him clean.

991
01:19:21,975 --> 01:19:23,350
Bring out the pan-cake.

992
01:19:42,016 --> 01:19:44,641
That girl is coming.

993
01:19:47,475 --> 01:19:48,600
Who?

994
01:19:48,641 --> 01:19:51,058
There she comes, go.

995
01:19:56,183 --> 01:19:57,350
I don’t know her.

996
01:20:03,516 --> 01:20:05,100
Go, finish her.

997
01:20:05,266 --> 01:20:08,058
Finish her?
What do you mean, brother?

998
01:20:10,350 --> 01:20:14,516
Here's the damn knife and
there's the girl in the blue outfit.

999
01:20:14,725 --> 01:20:15,725
Go, kill her.

1000
01:20:16,266 --> 01:20:18,891
Kill her?
Don’t play the fool, brother.

1001
01:20:22,891 --> 01:20:24,683
Who are you?
Aren’t you Chinna?

1002
01:20:24,891 --> 01:20:25,933
No. I am Karthik.

1003
01:20:25,975 --> 01:20:27,225
They call me ‘Little’ Karthik.

1004
01:20:27,350 --> 01:20:28,641
Why did you get into this car?

1005
01:20:29,266 --> 01:20:31,391
I thought the cinema company sent it.
Brother, please drop me back.

1006
01:20:36,683 --> 01:20:40,766
There’s been a goof up.
The man in the car is not Thangamani’s man.

1007
01:20:41,225 --> 01:20:43,475
He got into the wrong car.
What do we do?

1008
01:20:44,266 --> 01:20:47,975
I don’t care what you do.
Get that fellow to kill her.

1009
01:20:52,100 --> 01:20:53,766
Brother, you go ahead with what
you have to do.

1010
01:20:53,766 --> 01:20:55,141
I’ll take an auto-rickshaw to go back.

1011
01:20:56,558 --> 01:20:58,016
Stop!

1012
01:21:00,225 --> 01:21:01,808
Don’t punch me on my face.

1013
01:21:01,808 --> 01:21:02,891
I play the hero in a film.

1014
01:21:03,225 --> 01:21:04,766
Are you going to kill her
or not?

1015
01:21:04,766 --> 01:21:05,766
I cannot. Let me go.

1016
01:21:09,266 --> 01:21:10,350
Go, kill her.

1017
01:21:10,391 --> 01:21:12,100
Why don’t you kill her yourself!

1018
01:21:12,516 --> 01:21:15,058
Damn it, do what I tell you to do.
-I won't.

1019
01:21:15,683 --> 01:21:17,100
Then you better die.

1020
01:21:18,475 --> 01:21:21,016
Let me go.

1021
01:21:21,350 --> 01:21:22,516
If I kill her,
will you let me go?

1022
01:21:22,808 --> 01:21:24,225
Go, kill her first and
I’ll let you go.

1023
01:21:28,391 --> 01:21:33,600
If you do something silly,
I'll kill both of you.

1024
01:21:57,516 --> 01:22:00,600
I don’t know who you are.
But they’ve sent me to kill you.

1025
01:22:01,058 --> 01:22:02,516
Don’t get scared.
I won’t do anything.

1026
01:22:02,683 --> 01:22:04,266
Who are you?
What are you saying?

1027
01:22:04,266 --> 01:22:05,600
Don't run.
Stay here.

1028
01:22:25,433 --> 01:22:28,058
Why are you looking
at me? Go.

1029
01:22:28,141 --> 01:22:30,058
You go away first.

1030
01:22:30,308 --> 01:22:32,308
I am able to foresee two
people dying.

1031
01:22:32,308 --> 01:22:34,141
Gosh! That will be you and me.

1032
01:24:00,641 --> 01:24:01,683
Who are you?

1033
01:24:04,141 --> 01:24:05,516
If he gets up,
he’ll kill us.

1034
01:24:08,766 --> 01:24:09,850
Go.

1035
01:24:11,266 --> 01:24:12,808
Get into the car.

1036
01:24:27,850 --> 01:24:30,141
After a long time, Actor Ajith and
I are coming together for this film called...

1037
01:24:30,391 --> 01:24:31,558
'Yatchan'

1038
01:24:31,933 --> 01:24:37,183
I know all of you are eager to see the newbie
playing his younger brother. The wait is over...

1039
01:24:38,391 --> 01:24:39,766
Presenting to you...

1040
01:24:52,391 --> 01:24:54,016
Stay here.

1041
01:24:54,558 --> 01:24:57,641
Listen, what is your name?

1042
01:24:58,850 --> 01:25:01,183
Here’s the new kid on
the block, Chinna!

1043
01:25:08,141 --> 01:25:10,183
Will these photos appear in
Thoothukudi newspapers too?

1044
01:25:10,308 --> 01:25:13,100
Not just Thoothukudi,
throughout the State.

1045
01:25:31,975 --> 01:25:32,850
Sir.

1046
01:25:34,308 --> 01:25:35,683
Where did you go?

1047
01:25:35,808 --> 01:25:37,475
We were looking for
you everywhere.

1048
01:25:37,683 --> 01:25:38,725
I got late.

1049
01:25:38,766 --> 01:25:40,183
Did the programme get
cancelled?

1050
01:25:40,475 --> 01:25:43,641
No way. They moved
on with another guy.

1051
01:25:43,766 --> 01:25:44,725
He’s the guy.

1052
01:25:44,725 --> 01:25:45,725
You changed the hero?

1053
01:25:46,683 --> 01:25:47,558
Him?

1054
01:25:47,683 --> 01:25:50,141
Whatever it is, speak
to Srini.

1055
01:25:53,266 --> 01:25:54,766
Sir, the manager is saying all
kinds of things.

1056
01:25:54,808 --> 01:25:56,891
I got late.
Can I see the director?

1057
01:25:56,891 --> 01:25:59,516
The director is very angry
with you. Go away.

1058
01:25:59,766 --> 01:26:02,391
I got caught in a big mess on the way.
You won’t believe what happened.

1059
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:04,225
Sir, please speak to him for me.

1060
01:26:04,266 --> 01:26:07,516
Karthik, even the Press has been told.
I can’t do anything now.

1061
01:26:07,725 --> 01:26:09,350
Sir, please...

1062
01:26:09,350 --> 01:26:13,891
Karthik, talent is not the only thing here.
Being on time is more important.

1063
01:26:13,975 --> 01:26:16,350
I’ll let you know if something
comes up.

1064
01:26:29,516 --> 01:26:30,850
What's the report?

1065
01:26:31,058 --> 01:26:32,766
Sir, it’s not a gang fight.

1066
01:26:32,975 --> 01:26:36,641
Something to do with love.
Everything happened in a jiffy.

1067
01:26:36,641 --> 01:26:41,100
Everyone saw the boy and girl leaving together.
They hit people who blocked their way.

1068
01:26:42,808 --> 01:26:44,600
This wallet was lying there.

1069
01:26:44,725 --> 01:26:48,641
They’ve identified him as
the man in the photo, sir.

1070
01:26:51,433 --> 01:26:56,808
If they've decided to kill me,
can't they make it quick and instant?

1071
01:27:00,641 --> 01:27:03,641
Ask him to stop. Please.

1072
01:27:07,141 --> 01:27:10,683
What did I ask you to do?
-You wanted that girl killed.

1073
01:27:11,266 --> 01:27:12,641
What did you do?

1074
01:27:12,641 --> 01:27:15,391
I got someone from another
town to do this job.

1075
01:27:15,891 --> 01:27:16,350
Why?

1076
01:27:16,808 --> 01:27:19,141
Because you didn’t want
to leave any  trace.

1077
01:27:20,766 --> 01:27:21,641
What happened after that?

1078
01:27:23,350 --> 01:27:27,808
The boy is quite smart, but something
happened in between.

1079
01:27:29,016 --> 01:27:33,475
I wanted to kill her because
I didn’t want any trouble through her.

1080
01:27:33,516 --> 01:27:35,225
Don’t I know to do that?

1081
01:27:35,350 --> 01:27:36,600
You do.

1082
01:27:36,725 --> 01:27:41,933
Two of my men are dead.
If the police get wind of it, I’ll be caught.

1083
01:27:42,350 --> 01:27:44,058
The date for the
nomination is nearing.

1084
01:27:44,266 --> 01:27:47,808
I asked you to kill her but
you’ve messed it all up.

1085
01:27:49,058 --> 01:27:49,558
Throw him away.

1086
01:27:49,683 --> 01:27:52,225
Please don’t.
Give me three more days.

1087
01:27:52,308 --> 01:27:59,766
I will finish your work.
Or even two days will do.

1088
01:28:00,016 --> 01:28:01,808
Keep this school bag for me.

1089
01:28:01,975 --> 01:28:05,600
Meanwhile, I’ll bring her corpse.

1090
01:28:05,725 --> 01:28:09,850
Or else, I will come back and wear
this bag and jump into the sea.

1091
01:28:09,891 --> 01:28:12,766
Please give me two days.

1092
01:28:21,975 --> 01:28:26,058
How can they torture a middle-aged boy by
holding him hostage mid-sea?

1093
01:28:26,433 --> 01:28:29,016
Where the hell did he go
letting me tremble?

1094
01:28:41,016 --> 01:28:44,016
He’s the new guy who is
all set to act with Thala.

1095
01:28:45,225 --> 01:28:47,350
You murderer!
What are you doing there?

1096
01:28:47,891 --> 01:28:49,933
What?
-Not you, idiot!

1097
01:28:49,975 --> 01:28:51,183
Just shut up and watch that.

1098
01:28:56,308 --> 01:28:58,850
Brother, look at this nonsense!
-What?

1099
01:29:01,266 --> 01:29:02,391
What the hell?

1100
01:29:06,891 --> 01:29:08,766
What is this, Renu?

1101
01:29:09,058 --> 01:29:11,975
You said the very thing
I didn’t want you to say…

1102
01:29:13,266 --> 01:29:16,100
How can you deliver your dialogues
while picking your ear?

1103
01:29:16,975 --> 01:29:19,100
What will you do if a girl
ditches you?

1104
01:29:19,141 --> 01:29:20,725
I’ll slap her.

1105
01:29:20,725 --> 01:29:22,141
You cannot slap her.
You have to beg.

1106
01:29:22,558 --> 01:29:23,808
I cannot beg.

1107
01:29:23,975 --> 01:29:26,100
Give me a good action sequence.
I can't handle romance.

1108
01:29:30,141 --> 01:29:31,350
Hey, 'Baldie'.

1109
01:29:31,433 --> 01:29:32,808
Chinna, step outside for a minute.

1110
01:29:33,058 --> 01:29:36,683
Who are you?
-I wanted to call you myself.

1111
01:29:37,100 --> 01:29:38,600
I need to speak to you for
5 minutes.

1112
01:29:39,058 --> 01:29:41,016
You can’t do that.
We are rehearsing.

1113
01:29:41,016 --> 01:29:42,641
Don’t worry.
He’s our guy.

1114
01:29:43,266 --> 01:29:44,933
'Baldie', how did you find me?

1115
01:29:45,433 --> 01:29:46,475
Give me a minute.

1116
01:29:48,516 --> 01:29:49,933
Why did you come here?
What’s the matter?

1117
01:29:50,516 --> 01:29:53,350
What are you doing here when
I asked you to do something else?

1118
01:29:53,516 --> 01:29:55,933
Your posters are plastered
all over town.

1119
01:29:55,975 --> 01:29:58,850
I got into the wrong car and
my whole life has changed.

1120
01:29:59,141 --> 01:30:00,558
I am acting with my hero.

1121
01:30:01,100 --> 01:30:03,350
I am going mad here.
You messed it up.

1122
01:30:03,766 --> 01:30:05,975
Why are you getting tense?

1123
01:30:06,266 --> 01:30:07,475
I’ve had to run for my life.

1124
01:30:07,558 --> 01:30:09,350
Someone else got into your car.

1125
01:30:09,391 --> 01:30:11,891
He killed two men and
saved the girl.

1126
01:30:11,933 --> 01:30:15,725
He killed two people?

1127
01:30:17,391 --> 01:30:21,266
I asked you to send just the driver.
Who is the other man?

1128
01:30:23,350 --> 01:30:24,350
Thangamani...

1129
01:30:24,350 --> 01:30:26,266
I sent two extra men in
case you goofed up.

1130
01:30:27,225 --> 01:30:28,600
You didn’t have faith in me.

1131
01:30:28,683 --> 01:30:29,683
Find someone else to do
your job.

1132
01:30:30,141 --> 01:30:31,266
Don’t make me angry.

1133
01:30:31,558 --> 01:30:35,641
Stop this nonsense and
finish my work as promised.

1134
01:30:36,308 --> 01:30:37,933
Are you being arrogant because
you gave me money?

1135
01:30:38,100 --> 01:30:40,350
This company will give me
money, I’ll return yours.

1136
01:30:40,350 --> 01:30:42,766
Big shots are involved.
They’ll kill us both.

1137
01:30:43,350 --> 01:30:46,433
If you utter another word,
I’ll kill you for the money you paid me.

1138
01:30:46,933 --> 01:30:49,141
We have nothing to do
with each other. Get lost.

1139
01:30:51,933 --> 01:30:52,766
Who do you have to see?

1140
01:30:52,808 --> 01:30:54,016
She knows where to go.

1141
01:31:14,475 --> 01:31:17,100
Hello, sir.
I am Thangamani.

1142
01:31:17,183 --> 01:31:18,475
He’s Ravi, that’s Shiva.

1143
01:31:18,558 --> 01:31:20,100
Damn! I am not here to
introduce everyone.

1144
01:31:20,100 --> 01:31:21,183
Where’s Karthik?

1145
01:31:21,433 --> 01:31:23,683
Sir, what wrong did my son do?

1146
01:31:24,058 --> 01:31:25,891
What a silly question to ask!

1147
01:31:30,225 --> 01:31:31,516
He got into the wrong car.

1148
01:31:31,850 --> 01:31:34,391
How can you threaten us
for such a small thing?

1149
01:31:34,683 --> 01:31:41,891
We boarded the wrong bus on
our way here. However we handled it.

1150
01:31:42,308 --> 01:31:44,141
He ran away with a girl.

1151
01:31:44,558 --> 01:31:47,183
Are you the girl’s father?

1152
01:31:48,516 --> 01:31:50,058
The girl’s father?

1153
01:31:50,475 --> 01:31:54,308
Uncle, I told you he’s become
a different person after coming to Chennai.

1154
01:31:54,475 --> 01:31:56,766
I am sure he has run away
with his daughter.

1155
01:31:56,975 --> 01:31:58,350
That can’t be.

1156
01:31:58,641 --> 01:32:01,016
Sir, even though I don't like her...

1157
01:32:01,350 --> 01:32:03,558
...technically, he should have eloped
only with this girl.

1158
01:32:05,225 --> 01:32:07,016
Why did he take your daughter?

1159
01:32:08,475 --> 01:32:10,016
Where are those two?

1160
01:32:10,058 --> 01:32:12,808
We don’t know where Karthik is.
We came here looking for him.

1161
01:32:14,100 --> 01:32:14,766
What is it?

1162
01:32:15,266 --> 01:32:17,641
Won’t any of you ever utter
a good word.

1163
01:32:18,183 --> 01:32:21,600
You're always talking about
bloodshed and violence.

1164
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:24,308
Speak positively.
Believe me, everything changes

1165
01:32:25,391 --> 01:32:27,183
I need to use the loo right
away.

1166
01:32:27,766 --> 01:32:30,016
Ask them to let him go.

1167
01:32:34,933 --> 01:32:37,641
Why are you laughing?
What are you doing, Deepa?

1168
01:32:38,475 --> 01:32:42,058
This is the first time I am seeing
a girl point a knife at me.

1169
01:32:42,058 --> 01:32:43,141
It's crazy.

1170
01:32:43,516 --> 01:32:45,558
Will you come with me?
You’ll be paid well.

1171
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:47,891
I’ll stab you.
Just let him go.

1172
01:32:48,016 --> 01:32:49,891
If she stabs me,
you bury him.

1173
01:32:50,516 --> 01:32:51,350
Don’t!

1174
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:53,475
Don’t harm him.

1175
01:32:54,641 --> 01:32:57,266
If you don’t want him to
be stabbed, drop your knife.

1176
01:32:58,183 --> 01:33:00,558
Drop it.

1177
01:33:01,266 --> 01:33:03,933
Aren’t you ashamed of letting
a girl threaten you with a knife.

1178
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:09,891
Until Karthik hands over that girl to me,
his father will be in our custody.

1179
01:33:10,016 --> 01:33:11,391
Let him go,
I will come with you.

1180
01:33:11,475 --> 01:33:13,350
What if you kill me on
the way?

1181
01:33:13,933 --> 01:33:15,808
See, you’re getting angry.
You’re danger.

1182
01:33:16,558 --> 01:33:18,266
Look at him.
A true son of the soil.

1183
01:33:18,308 --> 01:33:19,725
Let’s take him with us.

1184
01:33:28,850 --> 01:33:29,766
You are all right.

1185
01:33:32,016 --> 01:33:33,141
How did I get here?

1186
01:33:33,183 --> 01:33:36,141
You fell unconscious.
Swetha brought you here.

1187
01:33:36,516 --> 01:33:38,308
You are safe here.

1188
01:33:41,016 --> 01:33:44,183
My life is over!

1189
01:33:44,433 --> 01:33:46,391
All my hard work has
gone a waste.

1190
01:33:46,391 --> 01:33:49,016
Someone else has walked
away with my part.

1191
01:33:49,475 --> 01:33:51,475
My life has gone to the
dogs because of you.

1192
01:33:52,141 --> 01:33:54,141
They came to kill me,
not you.

1193
01:33:54,391 --> 01:33:56,600
But it’s my life that
they’ve taken.

1194
01:33:57,891 --> 01:33:58,891
Come, tell the police about it.

1195
01:33:59,016 --> 01:34:02,350
They’re looking for you.
Go, get caught.

1196
01:34:02,558 --> 01:34:03,975
Why is everyone looking for me?

1197
01:34:03,975 --> 01:34:06,683
I saved you, that’s the only
thing I did wrong.

1198
01:34:06,891 --> 01:34:08,350
The police is looking for
you because...

1199
01:34:08,350 --> 01:34:11,850
...they claim you killed two men who
came in the way of our love.

1200
01:34:13,725 --> 01:34:14,850
Who are those men?

1201
01:34:18,058 --> 01:34:22,266
Meenamma,
I think they are Vetri’s men.

1202
01:34:22,891 --> 01:34:24,391
Vetri's men?

1203
01:34:24,683 --> 01:34:26,350
Hello, wait a minute.

1204
01:34:26,516 --> 01:34:28,558
Who’s Vetri and what is your
problem with him?

1205
01:34:32,225 --> 01:34:36,350
I happened to meet Vetri sir,
in a traffic jam.

1206
01:34:37,850 --> 01:34:39,808
His men were very anxious.

1207
01:34:41,100 --> 01:34:43,766
He was unconscious in his car.

1208
01:34:45,100 --> 01:34:47,391
I realised he had a mild
heart attack.

1209
01:34:49,016 --> 01:34:54,183
Since I was a nurse I administered First Aid and
saved him even before the ambulance arrived.

1210
01:35:01,058 --> 01:35:03,641
The very next day he
asked to see me.

1211
01:35:04,100 --> 01:35:06,308
I went to his ice factory
to see him.

1212
01:35:06,600 --> 01:35:10,975
When I went there, I realised that close to 3000
families depended on him for their livelihood.

1213
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:13,558
He was God to them.

1214
01:35:14,100 --> 01:35:16,475
He wanted to do
something in return.

1215
01:35:17,808 --> 01:35:20,225
I have to express my gratitude.

1216
01:35:20,683 --> 01:35:21,475
Tell me how.

1217
01:35:21,975 --> 01:35:27,183
If you feel that way, please do something to help
'Gayathri Illam’, the orphanage I grew up in.

1218
01:35:27,558 --> 01:35:29,308
They need help.

1219
01:35:32,600 --> 01:35:36,266
Vetri sir did a lot for us.

1220
01:35:37,058 --> 01:35:40,891
We were able to educate
the children there.

1221
01:35:41,516 --> 01:35:44,725
We wanted to thank him for everything.
We went to meet him one day.

1222
01:35:49,350 --> 01:35:52,141
What happened?
Come inside.

1223
01:35:52,891 --> 01:35:54,058
I think I am fine.

1224
01:35:54,058 --> 01:35:55,975
Please wait, let me check.

1225
01:36:11,766 --> 01:36:15,600
When I held his hand, I had a vision of someone
beating him up and throwing him into the sea.

1226
01:36:16,183 --> 01:36:19,766
When I realised his life was in danger,
I had to tell him about it.

1227
01:36:20,433 --> 01:36:24,016
I asked him to be cautious if
he had enemies.

1228
01:36:24,766 --> 01:36:30,975
The only man who hates me and considers me an
enemy is my younger brother, Selvam.

1229
01:36:31,391 --> 01:36:35,225
I was shocked to hear that his
brother was his enemy.

1230
01:36:35,933 --> 01:36:37,850
Did he die after your vision?

1231
01:36:39,183 --> 01:36:39,808
No.

1232
01:36:39,933 --> 01:36:42,058
Who are you conning?

1233
01:36:42,183 --> 01:36:45,475
She held his hand,
prophesied his death. Nonsense!

1234
01:36:45,891 --> 01:36:47,725
She had an accident when
she was very young.

1235
01:36:47,808 --> 01:36:50,266
She started having visions
after that.

1236
01:36:51,558 --> 01:36:56,058
A few days later, we heard his
younger brother passed away.

1237
01:36:57,016 --> 01:36:58,100
We went there.

1238
01:36:59,725 --> 01:37:03,975
I predicted this death for him,
but it happened to his brother.

1239
01:37:04,308 --> 01:37:06,141
I was confused.

1240
01:37:06,600 --> 01:37:13,891
He said his brother was the only
impediment to his progress.

1241
01:37:14,016 --> 01:37:18,391
I suspected he killed his
brother because of that.

1242
01:37:19,725 --> 01:37:23,308
But my gut feeling was that he
wouldn’t do such a thing.

1243
01:37:23,391 --> 01:37:25,225
I didn’t know if I should
ask him about it.

1244
01:37:25,641 --> 01:37:30,433
To clear my doubts, I gathered courage
and decided to confront him.

1245
01:37:30,891 --> 01:37:33,433
Are you accusing me of killing
my own brother?

1246
01:37:34,475 --> 01:37:38,808
Sir, I just felt something had
gone wrong.

1247
01:37:39,016 --> 01:37:40,308
Stop it.

1248
01:37:41,641 --> 01:37:42,558
It is my fault...

1249
01:37:43,683 --> 01:37:48,308
It is my fault.
I gave you too much liberty.

1250
01:37:50,016 --> 01:37:52,141
I killed my brother?

1251
01:37:52,975 --> 01:37:54,516
Listen to me carefully.

1252
01:37:55,058 --> 01:38:01,391
Don’t you dare tell me about your visions
and predictions ever again.

1253
01:38:02,183 --> 01:38:03,975
Do you get it, leave.

1254
01:38:08,475 --> 01:38:10,933
I had never heard him
speak that way.

1255
01:38:11,516 --> 01:38:15,391
My suspicions grew stronger.

1256
01:38:16,308 --> 01:38:18,308
I couldn’t keep quiet about it.

1257
01:38:18,808 --> 01:38:21,016
I was sure something had
gone wrong.

1258
01:38:21,641 --> 01:38:23,558
I went to meet Inspector Velraj.

1259
01:38:24,266 --> 01:38:25,558
You are making a mistake, Swetha.

1260
01:38:26,350 --> 01:38:28,975
Don’t go about saying this
to other people.

1261
01:38:29,391 --> 01:38:30,850
Vetri is going to become
an MLA very soon.

1262
01:38:31,308 --> 01:38:32,808
Your life will be in danger.

1263
01:38:33,641 --> 01:38:36,683
If what you claim is true,
I will take immediate action.

1264
01:38:37,266 --> 01:38:39,766
Until then,
don’t talk about this.

1265
01:38:40,141 --> 01:38:42,766
I followed Velraj sir’s advice.
I didn’t breathe a word to anyone.

1266
01:38:43,225 --> 01:38:44,850
It’s only after that,
did these things happen.

1267
01:38:46,641 --> 01:38:47,808
You are innocent for sure.

1268
01:38:48,850 --> 01:38:50,725
But I don’t feature in your
flashback at all.

1269
01:38:51,141 --> 01:38:54,475
This is only about Vetri and you.
I am not there even in one scene, am I?

1270
01:38:56,058 --> 01:38:58,766
You have a good cop in
your story.

1271
01:38:58,850 --> 01:39:02,933
Call him and tell him I have
nothing to do with all this and get Vetri caught.

1272
01:39:03,058 --> 01:39:04,933
After that, you go your
way and I, mine.

1273
01:39:04,975 --> 01:39:06,683
But, where do I go...

1274
01:39:07,766 --> 01:39:10,016
Velraj sir is the only one
who can save us.

1275
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:14,141
Are you safe, Swetha?

1276
01:39:14,516 --> 01:39:15,808
They tried killing me.

1277
01:39:16,558 --> 01:39:18,558
I feel I am right about
my suspicions.

1278
01:39:18,558 --> 01:39:23,808
The men who came after me
at the market were Vetri’s men.

1279
01:39:24,266 --> 01:39:26,475
Where are the two of you?

1280
01:39:26,725 --> 01:39:27,891
We are at ‘Gayathri Illam’, sir.

1281
01:39:28,391 --> 01:39:30,391
The boy who saved me,
Karthik is also with me.

1282
01:39:30,600 --> 01:39:34,016
Things are out of control now.
We need to be cautious.

1283
01:39:34,225 --> 01:39:37,725
Safety is priority.
Don’t tell anyone where you are.

1284
01:39:38,141 --> 01:39:41,475
The two of you must not call anyone,
nor should you step out.

1285
01:39:41,558 --> 01:39:43,808
When I call you, come to
the place I tell you.

1286
01:39:46,350 --> 01:39:48,683
What happened?
– He’ll call again.

1287
01:39:50,100 --> 01:39:52,016
Just hold my hand and tell me if
everything will be all right?

1288
01:39:52,933 --> 01:39:54,225
I can’t make predictions
just like that.

1289
01:39:54,433 --> 01:39:56,350
Let’s go.

1290
01:39:56,350 --> 01:39:57,766
Isn't it better to be aware?

1291
01:40:02,600 --> 01:40:05,225
I told you she would call me.

1292
01:40:05,558 --> 01:40:07,308
A boy called Karthik saved her.

1293
01:40:08,058 --> 01:40:09,141
Where is she?

1294
01:40:09,391 --> 01:40:10,100
She is at the orphanage.

1295
01:40:10,516 --> 01:40:15,308
We’ll be in big trouble if
she stays alive.

1296
01:40:17,558 --> 01:40:21,808
I will kill the two of them myself.

1297
01:40:23,141 --> 01:40:23,975
Vetri, wait.

1298
01:40:24,266 --> 01:40:25,308
Don’t be in a hurry.

1299
01:40:25,350 --> 01:40:26,850
It has gone wrong already.

1300
01:40:27,641 --> 01:40:30,766
Don’t lose the good reputation
you have at the orphanage.

1301
01:40:33,933 --> 01:40:35,683
The girl trusts me.

1302
01:40:36,683 --> 01:40:41,058
Once I confirm she hasn’t told anyone
else about this, I will kill them myself.

1303
01:40:42,766 --> 01:40:43,600
I’ll take care of it.

1304
01:40:46,266 --> 01:40:47,975
Are you ready, sir?
Music!

1305
01:41:02,433 --> 01:41:03,100
Stop the music.

1306
01:41:04,266 --> 01:41:05,516
Idiot!

1307
01:41:05,558 --> 01:41:06,558
How many times do
I have to teach you?

1308
01:41:06,808 --> 01:41:08,350
Master, why are you hitting him?

1309
01:41:08,516 --> 01:41:09,558
You’re doing well, sir.

1310
01:41:09,600 --> 01:41:10,475
I have taught him a
hundred times.

1311
01:41:10,975 --> 01:41:12,100
He’s a dunce.

1312
01:41:13,183 --> 01:41:16,516
He’s as lifeless as a rock.

1313
01:41:18,766 --> 01:41:20,808
Master, let’s avoid difficult moves.

1314
01:41:21,266 --> 01:41:25,600
Should we just seat him on a chair
and make the camera dance instead?

1315
01:41:25,850 --> 01:41:30,183
'Baldie', here I am struggling to dance
and you’re troubling me.

1316
01:41:30,225 --> 01:41:31,475
Get out of here.

1317
01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:34,683
Tell him.

1318
01:41:39,391 --> 01:41:42,016
Why did you bring the police?

1319
01:41:42,100 --> 01:41:43,558
You’ll take money from me
and kill me?

1320
01:41:43,725 --> 01:41:44,558
Talk to him.

1321
01:41:45,850 --> 01:41:48,558
Sir, we are friends.

1322
01:41:48,766 --> 01:41:51,766
I was only kidding when I threatened
to kill him. Tell him.

1323
01:41:53,766 --> 01:41:55,266
Won’t you finish the job
given to you?

1324
01:41:57,183 --> 01:42:00,475
I told you big shots were involved.
You didn’t listen.

1325
01:42:00,683 --> 01:42:01,558
Face it.

1326
01:42:02,308 --> 01:42:04,766
Sir, I’ve not murdered anyone.

1327
01:42:04,891 --> 01:42:07,058
Didn’t I say I would return
the money?

1328
01:42:07,100 --> 01:42:07,683
No.

1329
01:42:10,683 --> 01:42:13,350
I’ve just started life anew.
I am acting with my hero.

1330
01:42:13,850 --> 01:42:15,600
I know everything about you.

1331
01:42:16,516 --> 01:42:17,558
Sir...

1332
01:42:17,850 --> 01:42:23,100
If I decide to, I can throw you behind bars
not just for the murder in Thoothukudi…

1333
01:42:23,141 --> 01:42:25,850
…I can frame more charges
and have you killed in jail.

1334
01:42:27,058 --> 01:42:29,225
Forget about your acting.

1335
01:42:30,641 --> 01:42:34,516
If you do what I tell you to,
you can move on with your life.

1336
01:42:35,100 --> 01:42:36,933
I will ensure you’re not
in trouble.

1337
01:42:37,683 --> 01:42:42,850
Will you do what I say or do
you want to go to jail?

1338
01:42:46,100 --> 01:42:47,391
Which film are you
shooting for?

1339
01:42:52,766 --> 01:42:55,516
Are you sure he asked us
to come here? -Yes.

1340
01:43:09,016 --> 01:43:11,183
Aren’t you the one acting
instead of me?

1341
01:43:12,725 --> 01:43:13,391
What are you doing here?

1342
01:43:14,475 --> 01:43:15,808
Was it your car I got into?

1343
01:43:16,808 --> 01:43:18,266
You got into the car meant
for me?

1344
01:43:21,266 --> 01:43:23,558
You messed up my life.
Aren’t you ashamed?

1345
01:43:24,558 --> 01:43:26,391
Couldn’t you have gotten off when
you knew it wasn’t your car?

1346
01:43:26,808 --> 01:43:27,725
You’re a fraud!

1347
01:43:31,016 --> 01:43:31,808
Who are you?

1348
01:43:32,100 --> 01:43:32,975
Keep quiet.

1349
01:43:33,141 --> 01:43:35,225
You got into my car.
You could have gotten off too.

1350
01:43:35,266 --> 01:43:38,558
You saved her unnecessarily
and got both of us into trouble.

1351
01:43:38,891 --> 01:43:40,433
So, you’re the one who
came to kill me?

1352
01:43:40,933 --> 01:43:42,850
Yes. I’ve been following
you for a week.

1353
01:43:42,975 --> 01:43:44,850
I wanted to kill you at
the market place.

1354
01:43:44,933 --> 01:43:46,433
He goofed up.

1355
01:43:46,475 --> 01:43:47,891
I’ve come to kill both of you.

1356
01:43:48,225 --> 01:43:49,933
Let’s run.

1357
01:43:50,975 --> 01:43:51,600
Don’t move.

1358
01:43:51,725 --> 01:43:53,225
You can’t get away from here.

1359
01:43:53,475 --> 01:43:55,225
The police will be here any moment.

1360
01:43:55,350 --> 01:43:56,725
Shut up.

1361
01:43:56,808 --> 01:43:58,183
Turn around.

1362
01:44:08,641 --> 01:44:09,308
Close your eyes.

1363
01:44:11,516 --> 01:44:12,183
Close your eyes.

1364
01:44:44,016 --> 01:44:45,350
Hey, what are you doing?

1365
01:44:45,350 --> 01:44:46,975
Stop it, both of you!

1366
01:44:47,100 --> 01:44:48,808
Drop the gun.

1367
01:44:49,266 --> 01:44:51,391
Karthik, come here.

1368
01:44:52,975 --> 01:44:53,891
Who are you?

1369
01:44:54,350 --> 01:44:55,600
Why are you trying to kill me?

1370
01:44:55,891 --> 01:44:57,641
Is that important?
Drop the gun.

1371
01:44:58,100 --> 01:45:00,891
Tell me this first.
Vetri sent you, didn't he?

1372
01:45:01,225 --> 01:45:04,641
I don’t know who Vetri is.
Put the gun down.

1373
01:45:04,683 --> 01:45:05,975
Don’t, Swetha.

1374
01:45:06,391 --> 01:45:08,725
How do you think I felt when
the gun was pointed at me?

1375
01:45:09,100 --> 01:45:09,725
Shut up.

1376
01:45:09,933 --> 01:45:12,808
I came to kill you.
I tried my best, but I am unable to.

1377
01:45:12,808 --> 01:45:13,683
Trust me.

1378
01:45:20,266 --> 01:45:22,850
Sir, he’s the one who tried
to kill me.

1379
01:45:22,850 --> 01:45:25,391
If you didn’t come here
on time, he would have killed me.

1380
01:45:25,433 --> 01:45:26,975
Sir, you're right on time.
-Give me the gun.

1381
01:45:32,266 --> 01:45:33,183
Sir, what are you doing?

1382
01:45:33,766 --> 01:45:34,475
Sir...

1383
01:45:35,058 --> 01:45:36,558
I am the one who sent him.

1384
01:45:39,891 --> 01:45:44,850
I told you not to interfere with Vetri’s
affairs and that I would take care of it.

1385
01:45:45,391 --> 01:45:46,641
You didn’t listen.

1386
01:45:47,766 --> 01:45:52,475
I trusted you all along.
You betrayed my trust.

1387
01:45:54,641 --> 01:45:56,558
Sir, it’s wrong.
We trusted you.

1388
01:46:01,725 --> 01:46:04,558
Thank God you are here, sir.
Or they would have killed me.

1389
01:46:05,475 --> 01:46:07,141
Why didn’t you follow my
instructions?

1390
01:46:07,183 --> 01:46:08,558
Sir, I didn’t do anything.

1391
01:46:12,475 --> 01:46:13,850
Sir, how can the police do this?

1392
01:46:14,600 --> 01:46:19,725
If you had killed her that day,
you wouldn’t be in trouble.

1393
01:46:19,850 --> 01:46:21,808
It wouldn’t have been necessary
to kill you.

1394
01:47:02,016 --> 01:47:03,350
You shot a policeman!

1395
01:47:06,016 --> 01:47:07,516
What are you doing?

1396
01:47:07,600 --> 01:47:09,766
Let’s go. Hurry!

1397
01:47:12,141 --> 01:47:13,350
Get into this.
–This is a police jeep.

1398
01:47:13,350 --> 01:47:14,100
Just get in.

1399
01:47:31,558 --> 01:47:32,808
Guna.
-Tell me.

1400
01:47:32,891 --> 01:47:35,975
We missed the ‘Vaathi’ at
the bus stop the other day.

1401
01:47:35,975 --> 01:47:37,683
We should definitely get
him today.

1402
01:47:37,891 --> 01:47:38,850
It has to be casual.

1403
01:47:38,850 --> 01:47:40,891
No, we have to make it rough.

1404
01:47:41,558 --> 01:47:43,600
He’s here.
Start the car.

1405
01:47:48,766 --> 01:47:49,808
You hit a police jeep.

1406
01:47:50,600 --> 01:47:51,975
Brother, it is not the police.

1407
01:47:52,016 --> 01:47:53,683
Sorry, brother!
It was a mistake.

1408
01:47:57,641 --> 01:47:59,225
Aren’t you the idiot from
Koyambedu?

1409
01:47:59,558 --> 01:48:03,183
This is the girl our brother
was telling us about.

1410
01:48:03,183 --> 01:48:04,475
Get both of them.

1411
01:48:08,641 --> 01:48:11,975
We missed ‘Vaathi’ again
because of him.

1412
01:48:12,975 --> 01:48:13,725
I don’t understand.

1413
01:48:13,975 --> 01:48:16,266
Two of your men were
killed at the market place.

1414
01:48:16,475 --> 01:48:18,266
There is a girl involved.

1415
01:48:18,558 --> 01:48:21,475
People at the Party are asking me
if you are involved in this issue.

1416
01:48:21,683 --> 01:48:26,016
No. I think it’s someone
else’s issue.

1417
01:48:26,141 --> 01:48:29,766
I believe you are not involved.

1418
01:48:30,683 --> 01:48:35,016
But if you are involved,
forget about becoming an MLA.

1419
01:48:35,350 --> 01:48:39,725
Even if other party members are ready to
accept you, I will oppose it.

1420
01:48:40,266 --> 01:48:42,308
Because I have
a reputation to safeguard!

1421
01:48:42,600 --> 01:48:46,058
People should not point a finger at
me for proposing a tainted candidate.

1422
01:48:46,975 --> 01:48:48,225
I am sure you understand.

1423
01:48:56,183 --> 01:48:58,058
Convey my regards to
your family.

1424
01:49:10,308 --> 01:49:11,558
What did I say to you?

1425
01:49:11,891 --> 01:49:14,891
You said you would kill her.

1426
01:49:17,141 --> 01:49:18,683
What did you say to that?

1427
01:49:19,391 --> 01:49:24,141
I told you not to risk your reputation at the
orphanage and that I would take care of it.

1428
01:49:25,933 --> 01:49:27,350
What happened after that?

1429
01:49:27,766 --> 01:49:30,058
Mani’s man goofed up.

1430
01:49:30,141 --> 01:49:31,725
We shouldn’t spare him.

1431
01:49:31,766 --> 01:49:32,808
That’s enough.

1432
01:49:35,016 --> 01:49:36,391
I gave you one job.

1433
01:49:36,891 --> 01:49:38,641
Just one simple job.

1434
01:49:38,975 --> 01:49:42,641
One became two and two
became three. Wonder how many more?

1435
01:49:44,891 --> 01:49:47,766
I would have done it myself. You scared me
about my reputation and stopped me.

1436
01:49:48,058 --> 01:49:51,308
Did you see the Party
leader grilling me?

1437
01:49:52,683 --> 01:49:57,183
I trusted you and everything
has gone for a toss.

1438
01:50:01,850 --> 01:50:04,850
I know exactly what to do.

1439
01:50:06,766 --> 01:50:07,933
Let me show you.

1440
01:50:11,475 --> 01:50:13,391
Is brother home?

1441
01:50:13,433 --> 01:50:14,016
He is.

1442
01:50:18,891 --> 01:50:22,766
Whenever I try to get ‘Vaathi’
you come and save him.

1443
01:50:22,891 --> 01:50:24,391
What is your connection
with him?

1444
01:50:24,558 --> 01:50:26,600
Who is ‘Vaathi’?

1445
01:50:26,975 --> 01:50:29,558
I blame my luck. Whichever car
I get into, trouble awaits me.

1446
01:50:29,725 --> 01:50:32,558
Look at that. Someone else
is playing my role.

1447
01:50:32,683 --> 01:50:34,350
Whenever I see it,
I get irritated.

1448
01:50:36,016 --> 01:50:38,516
You were supposed to play
his role?
-Yes, brother.

1449
01:50:38,516 --> 01:50:39,850
I’ll break your bones.

1450
01:50:40,100 --> 01:50:42,725
He has gone through such
a tough selection process.

1451
01:50:42,725 --> 01:50:43,266
You claim the role is yours.

1452
01:50:43,308 --> 01:50:44,475
Shut up!

1453
01:50:48,475 --> 01:50:50,266
Are you heading to the hospital
or to the mortuary?

1454
01:50:50,308 --> 01:50:51,475
You’re next in line.

1455
01:50:56,516 --> 01:50:57,475
Chandru...

1456
01:50:57,725 --> 01:50:58,933
Swetha...

1457
01:50:58,933 --> 01:51:00,600
How did you manage to bring her?

1458
01:51:00,808 --> 01:51:03,933
Brother, we went to get ‘Vaathi’ but
we saw her and kidnapped her.

1459
01:51:04,433 --> 01:51:07,016
Good job, but don't ever
touch her again.

1460
01:51:07,350 --> 01:51:08,641
Chandru, what is all this?

1461
01:51:08,641 --> 01:51:11,808
That idiot broke my bones.
I will take care of him later.

1462
01:51:12,100 --> 01:51:13,683
Why did you bring me?

1463
01:51:13,725 --> 01:51:15,600
Won’t you take my help
when you are in trouble?

1464
01:51:15,725 --> 01:51:16,766
But how can I let it go?

1465
01:51:16,891 --> 01:51:18,766
I told my boys to bring
you to safety.

1466
01:51:18,850 --> 01:51:21,641
You should have stepped
into this place as my bride, Swetha.

1467
01:51:21,766 --> 01:51:24,641
They brought you here so
unceremoniously.

1468
01:51:25,308 --> 01:51:27,391
Is he the one who is in love
with you?

1469
01:51:27,433 --> 01:51:28,766
Throw him out of here.

1470
01:51:29,391 --> 01:51:30,725
Chandru, let him be.

1471
01:51:30,933 --> 01:51:33,100
Swetha, why are you getting angry
if we harass him?

1472
01:51:33,141 --> 01:51:34,016
You’re in love with him,
aren’t you?

1473
01:51:34,100 --> 01:51:35,475
Chandru, I am not in love with him.

1474
01:51:35,516 --> 01:51:36,933
The newspapers and TV
reports say so.

1475
01:51:37,016 --> 01:51:38,558
You’re crazy.
That’s not true.

1476
01:51:38,725 --> 01:51:40,641
He saved me from the man
who tried to murder me.

1477
01:51:41,225 --> 01:51:43,391
He’s like a brother to you.

1478
01:51:46,641 --> 01:51:49,058
Stay inside.

1479
01:51:49,725 --> 01:51:53,225
I’ve told you not to stand around
watching people being beaten up.

1480
01:51:53,433 --> 01:51:55,433
Your shirt has bloodstains.

1481
01:51:55,808 --> 01:51:59,725
Uncle, I’ve told you about Swetha.
She is here.

1482
01:52:00,225 --> 01:52:01,558
So, you are Swetha!

1483
01:52:01,683 --> 01:52:05,975
Chandru told me you are in trouble.
-Yes, sir.

1484
01:52:06,683 --> 01:52:09,766
He’s been so upset,
he’s not drunk an ounce of water.

1485
01:52:09,933 --> 01:52:11,600
Chandru…
-Sorry, that was a mistake.

1486
01:52:13,516 --> 01:52:15,808
This is my territory.

1487
01:52:16,183 --> 01:52:18,808
This is a gangster’s fortress…

1488
01:52:19,058 --> 01:52:20,891
No one can enter without
my permission.

1489
01:52:21,600 --> 01:52:25,141
Even the police think twice
before they step in here.

1490
01:52:25,475 --> 01:52:27,183
Don’t worry about anything.

1491
01:52:28,725 --> 01:52:30,558
Who is this?
Sir, I am Karthik.

1492
01:52:30,600 --> 01:52:33,350
He saved her.
He’s like a brother to her.

1493
01:52:33,391 --> 01:52:34,808
Your job is done.
You may go.

1494
01:52:34,975 --> 01:52:38,558
Sir, if he steps out,
his life will be in danger.

1495
01:52:39,350 --> 01:52:41,600
Because I saved her,
my life is in danger as well.

1496
01:52:41,600 --> 01:52:42,641
You can die, it's all right.

1497
01:52:42,641 --> 01:52:44,433
Let him stay here too.

1498
01:52:44,641 --> 01:52:47,641
Sure, uncle.
Let him sleep in my room.

1499
01:52:48,391 --> 01:52:49,558
Come on, boys.

1500
01:52:50,266 --> 01:52:52,391
What happened to the ‘Vaathi’ issue?

1501
01:52:52,433 --> 01:52:54,600
They went to get him,
but came back with them instead.

1502
01:52:55,475 --> 01:52:57,725
It shouldn’t go wrong again.
-Ok, uncle.

1503
01:52:58,433 --> 01:53:00,558
It's been a shame.
-Yes, uncle.

1504
01:53:00,891 --> 01:53:02,850
For the last 13 years...

1505
01:53:03,641 --> 01:53:06,225
Have to succeed this time!

1506
01:53:06,266 --> 01:53:07,183
We’ll get him.

1507
01:53:08,391 --> 01:53:10,516
If you had killed her that day,
we won’t be facing this now.

1508
01:53:11,433 --> 01:53:13,225
I wanted to kill her.

1509
01:53:13,350 --> 01:53:16,350
I pointed the gun at her,
but couldn’t pull the trigger.

1510
01:53:16,391 --> 01:53:17,516
Why?

1511
01:53:17,600 --> 01:53:21,266
When I looked into her eyes,
it was electrifying…

1512
01:53:21,433 --> 01:53:25,516
My head was telling me to kill her,
but my heart was holding me back.

1513
01:53:28,266 --> 01:53:29,308
I was stuck.

1514
01:53:29,933 --> 01:53:32,766
She comes in my dreams
every now and then.

1515
01:53:34,433 --> 01:53:37,808
You like her. You’re falling
in love with her.

1516
01:53:39,225 --> 01:53:42,433
But, 'Baldie' said only people
who are going to die come in our dreams.

1517
01:53:42,725 --> 01:53:44,183
Hey, are you crazy?

1518
01:53:44,183 --> 01:53:46,058
If she comes in your dreams
what does it mean?

1519
01:53:46,058 --> 01:53:50,100
It means you like her and you are
thinking of her all the time.

1520
01:53:50,975 --> 01:53:53,725
Don’t confuse him.

1521
01:53:54,308 --> 01:53:56,016
Just close your eyes for a moment.

1522
01:53:59,308 --> 01:54:00,808
Now, who do you see?

1523
01:54:05,683 --> 01:54:08,225
I see that girl, Mark.

1524
01:54:08,725 --> 01:54:12,016
You’re in love for sure.

1525
01:54:12,141 --> 01:54:16,641
But if you run away, what if someone
else kills her? What will you do?

1526
01:54:19,058 --> 01:54:20,100
What are you saying?

1527
01:54:20,391 --> 01:54:22,433
It’s simple.

1528
01:54:22,475 --> 01:54:24,433
You need to make her
fall for you.

1529
01:54:24,475 --> 01:54:28,808
Just tell her that she will stand out
in a bunch of 10 call girls.

1530
01:54:29,183 --> 01:54:32,308
Also tell her she is not someone
you can get over a phone call.

1531
01:54:32,433 --> 01:54:34,141
See what happens.

1532
01:54:34,975 --> 01:54:37,433
Look at my status and look
at hers.-For what?

1533
01:54:37,558 --> 01:54:39,183
Where am I and where is she...

1534
01:54:39,183 --> 01:54:40,433
Where?

1535
01:54:40,475 --> 01:54:42,308
Idiot, she’s educated and has a job.

1536
01:54:42,475 --> 01:54:46,391
Boss, educated or uneducated,
working or not working...

1537
01:54:46,391 --> 01:54:50,933
...earning or not earning, a girl is always
a girl and the heart knows no difference.

1538
01:54:52,308 --> 01:54:54,725
Mark is on the mark for
the first time.

1539
01:54:55,516 --> 01:54:57,016
Where will we find Karthik?

1540
01:55:00,516 --> 01:55:01,808
Deepa, this is Karthik.

1541
01:55:02,391 --> 01:55:03,391
Which Karthik?

1542
01:55:03,516 --> 01:55:04,808
It’s your Karthik.

1543
01:55:04,933 --> 01:55:09,058
Are you the one who has eloped with
a girl and is in hiding?

1544
01:55:09,266 --> 01:55:10,683
So much has happened.

1545
01:55:11,225 --> 01:55:13,683
I am at Durai’s house in Otteri.
Come here, quick.

1546
01:55:14,766 --> 01:55:16,433
I am coming.

1547
01:55:16,933 --> 01:55:19,183
Ask him for the address.

1548
01:55:19,600 --> 01:55:20,683
Where in Otteri?

1549
01:55:20,683 --> 01:55:22,808
Ask for ‘Otteri’ Durai…
Anyone will bring you here.

1550
01:55:22,975 --> 01:55:24,433
That’s it?

1551
01:55:25,516 --> 01:55:26,933
'Otteri' Durai.

1552
01:55:28,766 --> 01:55:31,641
Get in.
-Sounds like a big shot. Hurry!

1553
01:55:33,808 --> 01:55:36,266
We've found Karthik!

1554
01:55:43,391 --> 01:55:45,683
Is that Durai?
He looks short.

1555
01:55:48,975 --> 01:55:50,475
No, it’s our Karthik.

1556
01:55:50,766 --> 01:55:51,975
Deepa, do you know what happened?

1557
01:55:54,850 --> 01:55:57,725
If I slap you, will her men
rush to your defence?

1558
01:55:58,141 --> 01:56:00,183
Go away.

1559
01:56:00,516 --> 01:56:01,683
Why did you slap me so hard?

1560
01:56:01,891 --> 01:56:03,141
They are brother Durai’s men.

1561
01:56:03,183 --> 01:56:04,558
We’ll be safe only here.

1562
01:56:05,016 --> 01:56:06,350
You want to be safe with her?

1563
01:56:06,475 --> 01:56:07,391
Where is she?

1564
01:56:07,558 --> 01:56:08,766
What happened, Karthik?

1565
01:56:08,891 --> 01:56:10,850
She is Deepa.
The one I was telling you about.

1566
01:56:11,933 --> 01:56:14,225
Who do you think you are?

1567
01:56:15,100 --> 01:56:16,308
Who the hell are you?

1568
01:56:16,350 --> 01:56:19,516
How dare you question a don
in his own house. I’ll break your bones.

1569
01:56:19,641 --> 01:56:20,975
Get lost.

1570
01:56:21,516 --> 01:56:22,266
What is this, Deepa?

1571
01:56:22,266 --> 01:56:25,016
I worked so hard to make you a hero.
What have you done?

1572
01:56:25,308 --> 01:56:28,683
Will you just entice any
guy who is good looking?

1573
01:56:28,850 --> 01:56:30,308
Who, this fellow?

1574
01:56:30,558 --> 01:56:31,558
Why is she blabbering, Karthik?

1575
01:56:31,558 --> 01:56:33,016
Deepa, listen to me.

1576
01:56:33,600 --> 01:56:37,433
People warned me saying you
would change once you leave town.

1577
01:56:37,600 --> 01:56:38,975
Your damn friend...

1578
01:56:39,433 --> 01:56:41,183
Deepa, calm down and listen.

1579
01:56:41,225 --> 01:56:43,975
We have nothing going
on between us.

1580
01:56:44,350 --> 01:56:49,433
Karthik was the one who saved me
from getting killed. That’s all.

1581
01:56:49,683 --> 01:56:51,683
You, villain.
She is in love with me!

1582
01:56:51,891 --> 01:56:54,058
I am her friend on Facebook.
-Get lost.

1583
01:56:54,266 --> 01:56:55,516
Please keep quiet, sir.

1584
01:56:55,683 --> 01:56:57,266
Deepa, settle down.

1585
01:56:57,391 --> 01:56:59,100
I’d told you they sent a car to pick
me up on the day of the launch.

1586
01:56:59,391 --> 01:57:00,433
The vehicles got mixed up.

1587
01:57:00,475 --> 01:57:02,558
I got into the car that was
meant for her killer.

1588
01:57:02,641 --> 01:57:03,683
That’s the confusion.

1589
01:57:03,891 --> 01:57:05,891
The guy who got into my car turned
into an actor and I became a murderer.

1590
01:57:07,433 --> 01:57:10,183
I swear. You’re the only
one I have.

1591
01:57:11,433 --> 01:57:13,433
Forget that,
now you settle down.

1592
01:57:14,183 --> 01:57:16,641
Karthik, I need to tell you something.

1593
01:57:16,975 --> 01:57:18,433
Tell him about it.

1594
01:57:18,600 --> 01:57:20,100
Your dad has been kidnapped.

1595
01:57:21,016 --> 01:57:21,933
Who took him?

1596
01:57:21,933 --> 01:57:22,808
Her father.

1597
01:57:22,850 --> 01:57:24,766
Her father?
-My father?

1598
01:57:24,850 --> 01:57:26,350
My parents are not alive.

1599
01:57:26,516 --> 01:57:28,516
She grew up in an orphanage.

1600
01:57:28,558 --> 01:57:31,141
Don't call her an orphan.
She’s got me. -Shut up.

1601
01:57:31,433 --> 01:57:33,641
Karthik, it must be Vetri’s men.

1602
01:57:36,058 --> 01:57:37,100
Who’s Vetri?

1603
01:57:37,433 --> 01:57:38,016
Can you keep quiet for some time?

1604
01:57:38,100 --> 01:57:40,141
My pants might be on
fire again.

1605
01:57:40,391 --> 01:57:41,641
They’ll be looking for you
everywhere.

1606
01:57:41,683 --> 01:57:43,516
It’s safer wearing this.

1607
01:57:43,600 --> 01:57:46,016
Where do we go looking
for her?

1608
01:57:46,100 --> 01:57:48,933
Let's look for her in all places
you followed her.

1609
01:57:49,225 --> 01:57:51,641
I ride fast.
Hold on tight.

1610
01:57:53,933 --> 01:57:55,850
Why are you hitting me?

1611
01:57:56,516 --> 01:57:58,266
Are you the ones from Thoothukudi?

1612
01:57:59,975 --> 01:58:00,766
Come, darling.

1613
01:58:05,183 --> 01:58:07,183
Why did you hit that cockroach?

1614
01:58:10,725 --> 01:58:12,308
Uncle, he is the one who hit me.

1615
01:58:12,350 --> 01:58:16,808
How dare you beat up my boy?

1616
01:58:17,141 --> 01:58:20,391
You also had the guts to
try and kill that girl!

1617
01:58:20,933 --> 01:58:22,433
Bring him inside.

1618
01:58:24,850 --> 01:58:26,683
Wait.

1619
01:58:27,058 --> 01:58:29,808
Brother, I don’t know anything about you.
Can you hear me out?

1620
01:58:30,266 --> 01:58:32,808
He is the one...
‘Otteri’ Durai.

1621
01:58:33,850 --> 01:58:37,475
Brother, I didn’t come to kill her.
Can I speak to her in private?

1622
01:58:37,475 --> 01:58:38,933
Untie me.

1623
01:58:38,975 --> 01:58:40,350
Don’t.

1624
01:58:40,433 --> 01:58:43,433
Brother, I won’t do anything.
Ask them to untie me.

1625
01:58:44,433 --> 01:58:46,016
Untie him.
-Uncle, don't.

1626
01:58:46,350 --> 01:58:48,516
Let’s see what he can do when
so many of us are around.

1627
01:58:48,725 --> 01:58:49,725
Yes, brother.

1628
01:58:49,850 --> 01:58:53,100
I kidnapped you only because
the boss asked me to.

1629
01:58:53,183 --> 01:58:55,808
You’re going to act with Thala.
Can I have a selfie with you?

1630
01:58:55,975 --> 01:58:57,100
I’ll think about it.

1631
01:58:57,141 --> 01:58:58,891
It’s fine. I’ll take it with
the man himself.

1632
01:58:58,891 --> 01:59:00,016
Swetha...

1633
01:59:00,975 --> 01:59:02,433
I just want to talk.

1634
01:59:02,433 --> 01:59:05,683
We’re not idiots. Do you think
you can kill her in front of us?

1635
01:59:06,225 --> 01:59:07,933
Whatever you have to say,
say it from there.

1636
01:59:07,933 --> 01:59:08,725
Well said, uncle.

1637
01:59:08,725 --> 01:59:11,100
Go ahead.
-In front of everyone?

1638
01:59:12,141 --> 01:59:15,266
How do I do that?
-Why are you setting your hair?

1639
01:59:16,308 --> 01:59:17,808
I don't know why...

1640
01:59:17,808 --> 01:59:20,641
I’ve begun to see you
very differently.

1641
01:59:23,100 --> 01:59:24,016
Hang on...

1642
01:59:24,016 --> 01:59:29,225
No matter which street corner, you are
the prettiest of all the call girls standing with you.

1643
01:59:29,433 --> 01:59:31,683
You don’t seem like a girl
we can get with a phone call?

1644
01:59:33,141 --> 01:59:35,058
Why are you saying such
dirty things?

1645
01:59:35,058 --> 01:59:38,558
Oh, no! I am really sorry.
This damn Mark's lines are not working.

1646
01:59:39,725 --> 01:59:40,975
Wait...

1647
01:59:41,100 --> 01:59:42,975
Let me just tell you all that I feel.

1648
01:59:43,433 --> 01:59:46,058
Initially when I saw you,
I didn’t feel anything.

1649
01:59:46,183 --> 01:59:50,475
It’s only after Chandru sang a song
to you, I started having feelings for you.

1650
01:59:51,100 --> 01:59:55,350
Later, as I kept following you,
I fell in love with you completely.

1651
01:59:55,350 --> 01:59:57,600
Idiot, that was not a group song.
It was my solo song.

1652
01:59:57,600 --> 01:59:58,391
Shut up!

1653
01:59:58,725 --> 02:00:04,516
Look here, I like just two people in this world...
Myself and my hero.

1654
02:00:04,683 --> 02:00:07,016
But now I like you more
than my own self.

1655
02:00:07,558 --> 02:00:08,891
Just one last thing...

1656
02:00:08,891 --> 02:00:12,100
If you leave me, my
confidence will be gone.

1657
02:00:12,141 --> 02:00:16,225
If you leave me,
my courage will be gone.

1658
02:00:16,808 --> 02:00:17,725
And then...

1659
02:00:17,850 --> 02:00:21,641
If you leave me, it's like
me deserting my own self.

1660
02:00:22,725 --> 02:00:23,433
That's all.

1661
02:00:24,850 --> 02:00:26,391
Super, bro.
-Thank you.

1662
02:00:27,141 --> 02:00:30,475
Those are my lines. The ones
I spoke during the audition.

1663
02:00:30,683 --> 02:00:32,558
Fraud! You're using my lines to
impress a girl.

1664
02:00:32,850 --> 02:00:34,350
He’s out there proposing to her
and you’re relaxing on the swing.

1665
02:00:34,516 --> 02:00:36,225
Didn’t you come there to kill me?

1666
02:00:36,308 --> 02:00:37,391
Why are you blabbering like a fool?

1667
02:00:37,516 --> 02:00:40,266
I am not blabbering.
I am serious.

1668
02:00:40,350 --> 02:00:45,308
I am clueless about what will happen next.
And you're coming up with new problems.

1669
02:00:45,433 --> 02:00:48,350
Swetha, you have nothing to worry.
I am there to help you.

1670
02:00:48,391 --> 02:00:50,058
Brother Durai is there too.
Don't get scared.

1671
02:00:50,058 --> 02:00:52,225
Hey... Hang on!

1672
02:00:52,391 --> 02:00:53,808
Do I look like a fool to you?

1673
02:00:54,016 --> 02:00:57,850
You’re professing your love
but she says you came to kill her.

1674
02:00:58,516 --> 02:00:59,558
Who sent you?

1675
02:01:00,433 --> 02:01:01,433
‘Baldie’ commissioned this.

1676
02:01:01,641 --> 02:01:04,141
I agreed to kill her for money.

1677
02:01:04,266 --> 02:01:05,475
I don’t know who has
asked him to do this.

1678
02:01:06,350 --> 02:01:07,225
Who is it?

1679
02:01:10,516 --> 02:01:11,308
Vetri?

1680
02:01:11,350 --> 02:01:14,225
The one who runs VS Fisheries.

1681
02:01:14,308 --> 02:01:15,725
What’s his problem with you?

1682
02:01:16,350 --> 02:01:18,683
I got to know he killed his
younger brother.

1683
02:01:19,266 --> 02:01:22,016
That’s when all the trouble started.

1684
02:01:22,100 --> 02:01:25,933
Brother, do you know Vetri?
-I do. But not too well.

1685
02:01:25,933 --> 02:01:28,766
Uncle has been very upset with
Vetri’s younger brother.

1686
02:01:29,350 --> 02:01:31,350
I had a brother who would’ve
been as old as Chandru today.

1687
02:01:31,766 --> 02:01:33,850
Selvam conspired to kill his brother.

1688
02:01:34,475 --> 02:01:38,266
I wanted to kill him myself,
but someone else killed him.

1689
02:01:40,016 --> 02:01:42,391
But you are claiming Vetri
killed Selvam.

1690
02:01:44,850 --> 02:01:46,308
He’s not that kind of a guy.

1691
02:01:47,600 --> 02:01:49,433
What’s the problem, Vetri?

1692
02:01:49,516 --> 02:01:51,558
Why did you want me to
come here all alone?

1693
02:01:51,725 --> 02:01:58,266
Let me tell you. Ever since you came home,
I’ve been gripped by fear.

1694
02:01:59,225 --> 02:02:01,850
What is your fear?
I don’t get it.

1695
02:02:02,141 --> 02:02:04,475
What did you say to me yesterday?

1696
02:02:05,725 --> 02:02:10,308
I asked you if you had anything to
do with the commotion at the market.

1697
02:02:11,516 --> 02:02:13,308
What was my response to that?

1698
02:02:13,850 --> 02:02:17,058
You said you had nothing
to do with it.

1699
02:02:17,891 --> 02:02:19,766
What did you say to that?

1700
02:02:20,308 --> 02:02:24,058
If you had anything do with it,
I asked you to forget about the MLA post.

1701
02:02:24,433 --> 02:02:25,850
That was my fear.

1702
02:02:28,475 --> 02:02:35,600
The fear of not becoming an MLA,
led me to kill my own brother Selvam.

1703
02:02:36,683 --> 02:02:38,975
You are putting the same
fear into me.

1704
02:02:41,141 --> 02:02:43,766
You conned everyone into believing
you are a good man.

1705
02:02:44,433 --> 02:02:45,850
Rascal, I won't let you...

1706
02:02:48,725 --> 02:02:51,391
We should not spare
a monster like you.

1707
02:03:27,641 --> 02:03:30,225
Yes, Velraj.
We know where that girl is.

1708
02:03:30,225 --> 02:03:33,850
The problem is that she is in
‘Otteri’ Durai’s custody.

1709
02:03:36,433 --> 02:03:40,225
Look here, Vetri and I are
not enemies.

1710
02:03:40,641 --> 02:03:44,183
I’ll talk to him and sort this
out amicably. Don’t worry.

1711
02:03:44,266 --> 02:03:45,350
Good, uncle.

1712
02:03:45,350 --> 02:03:46,391
Brother...

1713
02:03:46,391 --> 02:03:51,808
Awesome. It will be great if
you can solve my problems too.

1714
02:03:51,975 --> 02:03:53,850
Brother...
-You stay right there.

1715
02:03:53,975 --> 02:03:56,641
Brother, if I don’t kill her,
Vetri will kill me.

1716
02:03:56,683 --> 02:04:00,100
If you take care of my problems,
I’ll get back to acting with my hero.

1717
02:04:00,183 --> 02:04:03,266
Don’t do that.
Let him die.

1718
02:04:03,725 --> 02:04:05,600
Don’t be childish.

1719
02:04:06,391 --> 02:04:08,391
Brother, we don’t have to feel
ashamed any more.

1720
02:04:08,433 --> 02:04:09,183
What are you saying?

1721
02:04:09,266 --> 02:04:11,683
Because you’ve passed your
12th grade.

1722
02:04:14,475 --> 02:04:18,016
Uncle, we are educated gangsters now.
Give me a high-five!

1723
02:04:26,850 --> 02:04:31,141
"Hey, you!
Don’t get cheeky."

1724
02:04:31,141 --> 02:04:35,600
"Come on, unwind and get
set to rock the stage."

1725
02:04:36,016 --> 02:04:37,183
There's the teacher (Vaathi).

1726
02:04:44,308 --> 02:04:46,183
"Start the music high."

1727
02:04:46,433 --> 02:04:48,308
"Get the glasses out."

1728
02:04:48,433 --> 02:04:52,475
"Loosen up and give me a high-five."

1729
02:04:52,725 --> 02:04:54,766
"Look up at the sky."

1730
02:04:55,100 --> 02:04:57,141
"Now, look down."

1731
02:04:57,391 --> 02:05:01,391
"Use your left hand, right hand
and give me a low-five."

1732
02:05:01,975 --> 02:05:06,308
"Pump up the volume."

1733
02:05:06,308 --> 02:05:10,433
"Put him down,
let the game begin."

1734
02:05:10,600 --> 02:05:14,808
"The teachers he looked at
with glee."

1735
02:05:14,850 --> 02:05:19,225
"The learned rowdy,
in his
vehicle is making his entry."

1736
02:05:19,266 --> 02:05:23,308
"On the throat did he,
place a knife casually..."

1737
02:05:23,350 --> 02:05:28,058
"If the move backfires,
back out tactfully."

1738
02:05:28,141 --> 02:05:30,016
"Start the music high."

1739
02:05:30,266 --> 02:05:32,141
"Get the glasses out."

1740
02:05:32,308 --> 02:05:36,350
"Loosen up and give me a high-five."

1741
02:05:36,558 --> 02:05:38,600
"Look up at the sky."

1742
02:05:38,933 --> 02:05:40,975
"Now, look down."

1743
02:05:41,225 --> 02:05:45,225
"Use your left hand, right hand
and give me a low-five."

1744
02:05:54,350 --> 02:05:58,600
"Hey, you!
Don’t get cheeky."

1745
02:05:58,600 --> 02:06:03,100
"Come on, unwind and get
set to rock the stage."

1746
02:06:46,391 --> 02:06:48,600
"Hey, Beautiful!"

1747
02:06:48,600 --> 02:06:54,016
"Don’t you have a little space
for me in your heart?"

1748
02:06:55,183 --> 02:06:58,475
"Tiny smiles are enough."

1749
02:06:58,725 --> 02:07:02,975
"Am I not a part of you, truly?"

1750
02:07:03,516 --> 02:07:07,516
"You are not alone.
For, I am with you."

1751
02:07:07,516 --> 02:07:12,058
"It is an unspoken secret
bond we share."

1752
02:07:12,183 --> 02:07:16,475
"Someday you’ll love me back."

1753
02:07:16,516 --> 02:07:20,891
"By looking at your eyes,
I’ll know that."

1754
02:07:25,975 --> 02:07:27,850
"Start the music high."

1755
02:07:28,100 --> 02:07:29,975
"Get the glasses out."

1756
02:07:30,141 --> 02:07:34,183
"Loosen up and give me a high-five."

1757
02:07:34,475 --> 02:07:36,308
"It will hit your senses."

1758
02:07:36,391 --> 02:07:38,641
"It will make you tingle all over."

1759
02:07:38,683 --> 02:07:42,725
"A stench it has that you’ll
crave for later."

1760
02:07:43,433 --> 02:07:47,266
"Your body will ask for more.
For alcohol it will roar."

1761
02:07:47,308 --> 02:07:49,225
"Once you drink,
you’ll transform in a blink."

1762
02:07:49,266 --> 02:07:51,683
"The high will leave you
high and dry."

1763
02:08:09,600 --> 02:08:11,475
"Start the music high."

1764
02:08:11,725 --> 02:08:13,600
"Get the glasses out."

1765
02:08:13,766 --> 02:08:17,808
"Loosen up and give me a high-five."

1766
02:08:18,058 --> 02:08:20,100
"Look up at the sky."

1767
02:08:20,391 --> 02:08:22,433
"Now, look down."

1768
02:08:22,683 --> 02:08:26,683
"Use your left hand, right hand
and give me a low-five."

1769
02:09:00,391 --> 02:09:03,975
Hey! Policemen!
We didn’t invite you.

1770
02:09:04,016 --> 02:09:05,433
Never mind.
Join us for dinner.

1771
02:09:05,433 --> 02:09:06,891
We’ve come here to make
an arrest.

1772
02:09:07,475 --> 02:09:08,225
Arrest who?

1773
02:09:08,475 --> 02:09:11,475
We are arresting Karthik and Swetha for the
murders at the market...

1774
02:09:11,766 --> 02:09:14,558
...and arresting Chinna
for the murder at Thoothukudi.

1775
02:09:15,350 --> 02:09:18,850
Inspector, do you realise
who you're talking to?

1776
02:09:19,016 --> 02:09:21,766
This is my territory and
they’re under my protection.

1777
02:09:21,933 --> 02:09:23,433
I won't let you arrest them.

1778
02:09:23,725 --> 02:09:25,850
Chandru, call the commissioner.

1779
02:09:25,891 --> 02:09:27,225
We are going to arrest you
as well.

1780
02:09:29,933 --> 02:09:30,558
Why?

1781
02:09:31,016 --> 02:09:38,100
We suspect you killed Selvam
to avenge your brother’s killing.

1782
02:09:38,516 --> 02:09:39,850
We have a warrant.

1783
02:09:40,600 --> 02:09:42,558
Durai, let’s avoid unnecessary trouble.

1784
02:09:43,058 --> 02:09:45,641
Uncle, the commissioner is not
answering our call.

1785
02:09:47,183 --> 02:09:50,933
Sir, I know you’re doing this
at Vetri’s behest.

1786
02:09:51,266 --> 02:09:53,016
Sir, he is Vetri’s man.

1787
02:09:53,141 --> 02:09:54,808
This has nothing to do
with Vetri.

1788
02:09:54,850 --> 02:09:57,641
I am the one you want.
I’ll come with you, sir.

1789
02:09:57,683 --> 02:10:00,308
Let them go.

1790
02:10:00,308 --> 02:10:02,058
Why are you pleading
with him?

1791
02:10:02,141 --> 02:10:04,516
I’ll take care of everything.
Let’s go.

1792
02:10:04,933 --> 02:10:08,266
Sir, please don’t go.

1793
02:10:08,308 --> 02:10:09,933
Sir, please listen to me.

1794
02:10:09,975 --> 02:10:13,391
If you come with me,
no one will return alive.

1795
02:10:13,766 --> 02:10:16,308
I had a vision of the three
of you dying.

1796
02:10:17,975 --> 02:10:20,225
Sir, I don’t want you to die
because of me.

1797
02:10:20,350 --> 02:10:21,933
I am sure something untoward
is going to happen.

1798
02:10:22,058 --> 02:10:24,225
Sir, trust me.
-What are you saying?

1799
02:10:24,600 --> 02:10:28,058
I could see it when the three
of you held my hand.

1800
02:10:32,808 --> 02:10:35,891
Are you people coming or do you
want me to take you by force?

1801
02:10:36,016 --> 02:10:37,433
Please don't come.

1802
02:10:38,016 --> 02:10:42,016
Sir, please just take me.

1803
02:10:42,850 --> 02:10:44,225
Sir, we’re coming.

1804
02:10:44,308 --> 02:10:47,183
Don’t come.

1805
02:10:49,641 --> 02:10:51,891
Don’t worry.
I’ll come back.

1806
02:10:54,433 --> 02:10:57,516
Chandru, it's over to you now.

1807
02:10:57,516 --> 02:10:59,475
Uncle...

1808
02:11:19,933 --> 02:11:23,058
Shame on you for framing
charges and bringing us here.

1809
02:11:23,516 --> 02:11:25,433
That’s why I don’t respect
policemen like you.

1810
02:11:27,183 --> 02:11:28,850
Vetri sir,
please let them go.

1811
02:11:28,975 --> 02:11:33,016
I am the one you want.
Let them go.

1812
02:11:33,016 --> 02:11:34,100
You...

1813
02:11:35,100 --> 02:11:35,933
Please, sir...

1814
02:11:35,975 --> 02:11:39,266
If you didn’t know about the
murder I committed…

1815
02:11:39,725 --> 02:11:44,725
...and if you hadn’t brought it up,
I would have spared each one of you.

1816
02:11:46,600 --> 02:11:47,350
Vetri...

1817
02:11:48,683 --> 02:11:51,933
I should have killed your brother
when he killed mine.

1818
02:11:52,558 --> 02:11:55,266
I let it go. But you killed
him for me.

1819
02:11:57,058 --> 02:11:59,725
I wanted to talk to you and solve
all the issues peacefully.

1820
02:12:00,225 --> 02:12:02,266
But now I realise you’re
a changed man.

1821
02:12:03,141 --> 02:12:04,141
I am a gangster too.

1822
02:12:04,891 --> 02:12:08,225
But what kind of a gangster kills so many
people just to become an MLA.

1823
02:12:09,016 --> 02:12:11,350
How are you different
from your brother Selvam?

1824
02:12:12,933 --> 02:12:13,975
No difference.

1825
02:12:16,350 --> 02:12:18,475
Absolutely no difference between
Selvam and me.

1826
02:12:20,266 --> 02:12:22,891
Because I am Selvam!

1827
02:12:29,225 --> 02:12:30,141
Vetri...

1828
02:12:47,808 --> 02:12:48,558
Selvam...

1829
02:12:57,891 --> 02:12:59,766
Why, Velraj?

1830
02:13:01,016 --> 02:13:03,058
There’s no point being on
your side.

1831
02:13:03,058 --> 02:13:05,766
But I can gain a lot by
being with him.

1832
02:13:06,100 --> 02:13:09,933
What are you doing, Selvam?

1833
02:13:11,350 --> 02:13:12,933
Why is it that...

1834
02:13:13,183 --> 02:13:17,891
...Vetri commands so much respect
and Selvam is spat upon?

1835
02:13:20,350 --> 02:13:25,225
We were born together...
and we also look alike, right?

1836
02:13:25,891 --> 02:13:30,350
But as you touched great heights,
I was cringing inside.

1837
02:13:31,516 --> 02:13:34,808
The more people praised you,
the more it killed me.

1838
02:13:35,475 --> 02:13:37,350
You can never become Vetri.

1839
02:13:38,683 --> 02:13:40,350
That’s why I’m taking
a ‘short-cut’.

1840
02:13:45,183 --> 02:13:46,641
Vetri...

1841
02:13:47,266 --> 02:13:54,016
The name you've earned, the fame you have,
the respect you command...

1842
02:13:54,016 --> 02:13:55,975
...the MLA post that awaits you...

1843
02:13:56,141 --> 02:13:59,683
...this Selvam is going to
enjoy every bit of it.

1844
02:14:01,100 --> 02:14:04,391
Now, I am going to live as Vetri.

1845
02:14:05,100 --> 02:14:09,350
And you are going to die
as Selvam.

1846
02:14:23,683 --> 02:14:25,391
Hey! Selvam...

1847
02:14:27,308 --> 02:14:29,308
I won't spare you.
-Me?

1848
02:14:39,433 --> 02:14:40,350
Stop it.

1849
02:14:40,391 --> 02:14:42,141
That guy took my place only
by mistake.

1850
02:14:42,225 --> 02:14:44,641
But you intentionally killed your brother and
took his place. Shame on you.

1851
02:14:46,475 --> 02:14:47,391
And you...

1852
02:14:48,350 --> 02:14:52,808
How could you predict Vetri’s
death so accurately?

1853
02:14:53,766 --> 02:14:57,433
So accurately, as if it happened
right in front of you.

1854
02:14:57,433 --> 02:14:58,308
How is that?

1855
02:14:58,891 --> 02:15:02,975
Come on. Hold my hand and tell
me what is going to happen to me.

1856
02:15:03,266 --> 02:15:05,558
Come on, tell me now.

1857
02:15:11,641 --> 02:15:13,350
I see you having a brutal death.

1858
02:15:14,641 --> 02:15:16,766
Bring them.

1859
02:15:28,683 --> 02:15:30,100
Oh no, my son!

1860
02:15:31,100 --> 02:15:32,475
What are you doing to my son?

1861
02:15:32,766 --> 02:15:34,516
How dare you beat my son!

1862
02:15:35,725 --> 02:15:37,725
He's running to his death!

1863
02:15:42,100 --> 02:15:42,975
My son!

1864
02:15:42,975 --> 02:15:44,516
I beg you. Let him go.

1865
02:15:44,808 --> 02:15:45,308
Father!

1866
02:15:45,391 --> 02:15:48,266
Spare my son.
He’s innocent.

1867
02:15:48,266 --> 02:15:49,391
Throw him in as well.

1868
02:15:51,808 --> 02:15:52,975
Finish them.

1869
02:15:58,350 --> 02:15:59,475
Spare my son!

1870
02:16:10,475 --> 02:16:11,225
Karthik!

1871
02:16:13,266 --> 02:16:15,225
-Karthik!
-Uncle!

1872
02:16:17,516 --> 02:16:18,975
Come on, boys!

1873
02:16:23,058 --> 02:16:26,058
Hey, where are you hiding?

1874
02:16:27,266 --> 02:16:28,433
Where is he?

1875
02:16:28,475 --> 02:16:31,350
I don’t know.
He brought us here.

1876
02:16:31,683 --> 02:16:32,683
Where’s my uncle?

1877
02:16:42,058 --> 02:16:42,891
Brother Kailasam…

1878
02:16:43,558 --> 02:16:45,266
There he is in the pit.
Karthik!

1879
02:16:45,266 --> 02:16:45,891
Deepa!

1880
02:16:46,016 --> 02:16:46,641
Uncle!

1881
02:16:48,183 --> 02:16:49,475
Who are you?

1882
02:16:49,516 --> 02:16:51,641
I am ‘Otteri’ Chandru.
I am a gangster.

1883
02:16:52,058 --> 02:16:53,600
Oh, my god! ‘Otteri’
Durai’s men!

1884
02:16:54,600 --> 02:16:57,058
Where is ...
-Shut up. Who the hell are you?

1885
02:16:57,058 --> 02:17:00,600
Who am I? Come to Thoothukudi,
you'll know who I am.

1886
02:17:01,933 --> 02:17:04,433
Don't move.
I'll shoot you if you move.

1887
02:17:04,600 --> 02:17:06,350
Crush them if they move.

1888
02:17:10,975 --> 02:17:12,058
My daughter-in-law!

1889
02:17:13,100 --> 02:17:14,225
Deepa!

1890
02:17:16,683 --> 02:17:18,725
-Give me a hand!
-Karthik, are you all right?

1891
02:17:18,891 --> 02:17:21,100
See, I've rounded up all of you.

1892
02:17:26,475 --> 02:17:28,058
Uncle, have they hurt you badly?

1893
02:17:30,933 --> 02:17:32,016
You wait...

1894
02:17:36,433 --> 02:17:39,100
How dare you borrow money from me
and also kill my man.

1895
02:17:39,683 --> 02:17:41,391
Hey!

1896
02:17:41,683 --> 02:17:44,266
I believe you were not bothered even
when they took my name.

1897
02:17:51,725 --> 02:17:52,725
Uncle!

1898
02:17:54,391 --> 02:17:55,350
Catch him!

1899
02:17:55,850 --> 02:17:57,350
Kill them all.

1900
02:17:59,850 --> 02:18:01,350
I'll take her safely.
You go fight.

1901
02:18:02,058 --> 02:18:03,391
Swetha, let's hide behind the car.

1902
02:18:20,308 --> 02:18:20,933
Deepa!

1903
02:18:23,183 --> 02:18:23,808
Deepa!

1904
02:18:30,641 --> 02:18:31,308
No...

1905
02:18:33,350 --> 02:18:35,058
-No...
-Hey!

1906
02:20:03,725 --> 02:20:05,891
Wait.

1907
02:20:09,558 --> 02:20:10,975
You don't do anything.

1908
02:20:12,141 --> 02:20:14,391
I have to settle scores with him.

1909
02:20:18,058 --> 02:20:19,266
Finish him!

1910
02:20:31,266 --> 02:20:32,433
You cheat.
Wait.

1911
02:20:32,433 --> 02:20:34,683
That's you.
-I know.

1912
02:20:34,766 --> 02:20:36,600
You’re walking away in
‘slow motion’.

1913
02:20:36,641 --> 02:20:38,308
Do you think you’re a big shot
if you become a film hero?

1914
02:20:38,475 --> 02:20:39,891
I hope you’re not hurt.

1915
02:20:40,058 --> 02:20:41,350
I am badly hurt.

1916
02:20:41,350 --> 02:20:44,683
I believe you beat up Kumar
even after he took my name. -No.

1917
02:20:44,808 --> 02:20:47,183
How dare you!
-Please hear me out.

1918
02:20:47,350 --> 02:20:49,308
He tore up tickets to our hero's film.
That is why I beat him up.

1919
02:20:51,725 --> 02:20:53,141
He tore up tickets to
our hero's film?

1920
02:20:53,308 --> 02:20:57,016
Yes. All the tickets I had.
He tore it all up. Ask him why.

1921
02:20:59,641 --> 02:21:04,391
Did Kumar really tear the tickets?
-Yes.

1922
02:21:04,475 --> 02:21:07,475
Had I known this,
I would have killed him myself.

1923
02:21:07,558 --> 02:21:09,933
You made everyone come all
the way just to get beaten up.

1924
02:21:09,933 --> 02:21:11,016
You liar.

1925
02:21:11,308 --> 02:21:12,350
Bring all of them here.

1926
02:21:13,725 --> 02:21:16,225
You get just two days to
return my money.

1927
02:21:16,475 --> 02:21:18,016
I’ll return it in two weeks.
–What?

1928
02:21:18,016 --> 02:21:19,308
I meant two days.

1929
02:21:23,766 --> 02:21:25,100
You don’t need stitches.

1930
02:21:25,100 --> 02:21:26,600
It will be fine in a few days.

1931
02:21:27,308 --> 02:21:30,183
I don’t want your movie role.
You can have it yourself.

1932
02:21:30,183 --> 02:21:31,641
I’ll just come along to see my hero.

1933
02:21:32,350 --> 02:21:36,141
I don’t want your mercy.
I’ll work hard and get to the top.

1934
02:21:36,141 --> 02:21:37,516
I’ll get even with you then.

1935
02:21:37,766 --> 02:21:38,558
Get lost.

1936
02:21:38,891 --> 02:21:41,058
Can I speak to you in private
for 5 minutes?

1937
02:21:41,100 --> 02:21:42,558
Whatever you have to say,
say it here.

1938
02:21:43,350 --> 02:21:44,350
I am madly in love.

1939
02:21:44,350 --> 02:21:45,558
Yes, say it here.

1940
02:21:45,808 --> 02:21:46,975
Why are you curious?

1941
02:21:47,683 --> 02:21:49,183
I spoke from my heart.

1942
02:21:49,475 --> 02:21:50,266
So?

1943
02:21:50,766 --> 02:21:52,141
I told you I liked you.

1944
02:21:52,225 --> 02:21:54,850
We were in trouble then and you
didn’t want to entertain such thoughts.

1945
02:21:54,850 --> 02:21:56,350
All your troubles are gone now.

1946
02:21:56,766 --> 02:21:58,308
You had so many visions
for everyone.

1947
02:21:58,683 --> 02:22:01,058
Hold my hand and tell
me about us.

1948
02:22:01,766 --> 02:22:03,266
I don’t get visions
whenever I want.

1949
02:22:03,558 --> 02:22:06,141
I took a bullet for you.

1950
02:22:06,475 --> 02:22:07,433
It hurts.

1951
02:22:07,725 --> 02:22:09,308
A bullet for me?
-Yes.

1952
02:22:09,558 --> 02:22:12,975
I am sure you saved me only
by accident.

1953
02:22:12,975 --> 02:22:14,725
You are right, Swetha.

1954
02:22:15,391 --> 02:22:17,308
Stop kidding and tell me.

1955
02:22:22,725 --> 02:22:24,100
You have dirty thoughts.

1956
02:22:24,391 --> 02:22:26,725
What…?
I didn't have dirty thoughts.

1957
02:22:26,975 --> 02:22:28,391
What did you see?

1958
02:22:29,725 --> 02:22:32,058
Uncle, he is proposing to her again.

1959
02:22:32,766 --> 02:22:36,683
Let’s not stay here anymore.
We'll shift back to our area.

1960
02:22:37,225 --> 02:22:38,975
We'll continue our 12th grade party.

1961
02:22:39,891 --> 02:22:41,016
Bring everyone.

1962
02:22:43,350 --> 02:22:44,183
Come, Deepa.

1963
02:22:44,266 --> 02:22:44,850
Swetha...

1964
02:22:46,058 --> 02:22:47,266
Why aren't you saying anything?

1965
02:22:48,641 --> 02:22:49,725
We’ll talk later.

1966
02:22:52,308 --> 02:22:55,433
Damn! Had I known, I would have
taken three bullets on my nose!

1967
02:22:55,475 --> 02:22:57,558
Taking bullets for her is
not good enough.

1968
02:22:57,641 --> 02:22:59,391
She just walked away
with a grin.

1969
02:22:59,433 --> 02:23:02,683
Are you an idiot? She’s indirectly
telling you that she loves you.

1970
02:23:02,766 --> 02:23:05,975
Swetha, hold my hand and tell me if
I will date Kareena Kapoor.

1971
02:23:06,475 --> 02:23:07,391
Hey, Swetha!

1972
02:23:08,558 --> 02:23:10,475
Chandru says you like me.

1973
02:23:11,683 --> 02:23:14,350
Do you always need someone
to explain everything to you?

1974
02:23:16,141 --> 02:23:17,641
Don't you understand it yourself?

1975
02:23:36,475 --> 02:23:38,683
Om sir, this is Karthik.

1976
02:23:39,433 --> 02:23:40,225
He's very talented.

1977
02:23:40,225 --> 02:23:41,350
He's appeared for many screen tests.

1978
02:23:42,516 --> 02:23:43,183
Sir is here.

1979
02:23:45,183 --> 02:23:46,308
Karthik, right?

1980
02:23:48,475 --> 02:23:50,850
Looks good, right?
-Yes, I agree.

1981
02:23:51,891 --> 02:23:55,891
S.J. Surya showed me your screen test.
He insisted I see it.

1982
02:23:56,266 --> 02:23:58,433
He said it was fantastic and
mind-blowing. I saw it too.

1983
02:23:58,641 --> 02:24:00,308
Very nice performance, Karthik.
-Thank you, sir.

1984
02:24:00,308 --> 02:24:01,933
Did you tell him, Kaushik?
-No, sir.

1985
02:24:01,933 --> 02:24:03,391
Karthik, I have good news for you.

1986
02:24:03,683 --> 02:24:05,558
You’re the hero of my next film.

1987
02:24:05,766 --> 02:24:07,641
Thank you, sir.

1988
02:24:08,516 --> 02:24:09,225
Karthik...

1989
02:24:11,433 --> 02:24:12,516
I forgot to tell you this.

1990
02:24:12,766 --> 02:24:14,350
Chinna will be acting with you.

1991
02:24:14,641 --> 02:24:15,641
Chinna?

1992
02:24:15,683 --> 02:24:16,683
In this one too?

1993
02:24:16,766 --> 02:24:18,808
My ‘double hero’ subjects have
worked out well in the past.

1994
02:24:18,850 --> 02:24:19,933
Don’t worry about anything.

1995
02:24:19,933 --> 02:24:21,141
Your character will be strong.

1996
02:24:21,141 --> 02:24:22,308
It will be equal to Chinna's.

1997
02:24:22,350 --> 02:24:24,766
Ok, sir.
-All the best. Welcome aboard.

1998
02:24:35,683 --> 02:24:36,808
What is your problem?

1999
02:24:36,933 --> 02:24:38,266
Why did you get into my car?

2000
02:24:38,558 --> 02:24:40,350
You’re the one in my car.

2001
02:24:40,350 --> 02:24:41,808
Brother, isn’t this a grey Innova?

2002
02:24:41,808 --> 02:24:43,850
Yes.
–Heard that?

2003
02:24:43,933 --> 02:24:45,975
Brother, isn’t this meant for a shoot?
-Yes.

2004
02:24:46,225 --> 02:24:47,391
Heard that?

2005
02:24:47,641 --> 02:24:49,850
Brother, wasn’t this car sent for me?

2006
02:24:49,891 --> 02:24:53,975
No.
-Tell him it’s for me.

2007
02:24:54,058 --> 02:24:56,058
This is not for you.
It’s meant for the heroine.

2008
02:24:56,058 --> 02:24:58,766
Both of you are in the wrong car.
Will the two of you get out?

2009
02:24:58,891 --> 02:25:00,308
Again?

2010
02:25:00,808 --> 02:25:02,641
Make sure you check the
next time.

2011
02:25:02,766 --> 02:25:04,183
You too.

2012
02:25:04,725 --> 02:25:05,600
Who’s the heroine?

2013
02:25:05,641 --> 02:25:06,433
Get lost!
