1
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:23,000
warning, warning, warning

2
00:02:27,416 --> 00:02:30,958
We have lost contact with Speed Bird 815...

3
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:34,541
I repeat… We have lost contact with Speed Bird 815

4
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:51,791
Due to a technical fault Flight 815 carrying 250 passengers…

5
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:54,833
It is being said that the death toll has risen to 70 

6
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:02,541
An incident that has rocked the entire aviation industry

7
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:05,000
A political storm has erupted in India

8
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:14,708
According to reports, most of the passengers in this flight were Indian

9
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,541
Crowd: We want justice!

10
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:22,083
No comments!

11
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:27,708
Crowd: We want justice!

12
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,708
Damn it! Let me wear my tie!

13
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:31,000
Journalist 1: What about the DGCA enquiry?

14
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,125
Journalist 2:The Airlines are blaming the Aircraft …your comments?

15
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:36,250
I don’t want to say anything… no...no.....

16
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:47,375
So viewers, as you saw that the crashed Flight 815’s manufacturing company…

17
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:52,333
Adityaraj Aviation has also refused to comment on this incident.

18
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:54,791
In order to shed a little more light on this subject,

19
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:59,000
we have with us today, the Chief of Inquiry for DGCA, Mr Rawat.

20
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,083
News Anchor: Welcome sir! 

21
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:00,666
Thank you!

22
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:03,541
Till now no one has taken responsibility for this unfortunate incident

23
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:08,166
How will we and our viewers know… who is responsible for this?

24
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:10,750
But, for that we first need to find the Black Box

25
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:14,375
Sir can you explain to our viewers what is a black box?

26
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:17,666
The black box is also known as the Cockpit Voice Recorder..

27
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:21,541
Mr. Rawat: ..but just to be clear this is actually… red in colour 

28
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:24,833
Mr. Rawat: Basically it records all the data inside the cockpit of the plane… 

29
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:28,750
Mr. Rawat : Including conversations between the pilots, till just before a plane crash…

30
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,958
Mr. Rawat:By listening to this, you can find out 

31
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:33,416
..what the real reason for the plane crash was…

32
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:36,625
 and if it was caused by negligence…

33
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:39,833
Would this Black Box not be damaged in the crash?

34
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:43,041
No! Not at all! It is very difficult to damage it

35
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:46,416
It doesn’t get damaged even in temperatures as high as a 1000 degrees…

36
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:51,000
So like Mr. Rawat explained, now we need to wait
for someone to find the Black Box.

37
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,250
Only then would it be clear, that who is responsible for this catastrophe.

38
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:01,500
Nathwani: Why don’t we just issue a statement ???

39
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,125
But let the reports come in at least…

40
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:07,875
Are you saying we have never issued a press statement before?

41
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:11,750
But before this, our equipment has never been questioned.

42
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:15,583
We answer the questions! Not You!

43
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,750
Khanna: Let’s not get personal... 

44
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:19,833
It’s a business decision after all…

45
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:25,291
There is a meeting with the investors in Dubai today evening.. 

46
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:27,000
We’ll have to give them something

47
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:29,083
But Mr. Khanna…

48
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:31,958
How can we issue a statement without any verification?

49
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:33,375
Farid Currim: What’s everyone else doing?

50
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:36,416
No one in the entire airline industry is willing to take responsibility! 

51
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:39,125
We! The manufacturers, are the easy target!

52
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:39,916
Nathwani: Exactly!

53
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:43,250
If the landing is bad… the landing gear is blamed

54
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:46,541
If the flight is bumpy…There is a problem with the design of the plane!

55
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:51,083
And even if there is some extra salt in the food they blame the temperature control!!

56
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:53,083
After all, we manufacture these planes !!!

57
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:58,833
Let's assume we issue a statement, that there was no fault in our aircraft…

58
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:02,541
but what happens when they find the black box… 

59
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:06,000
You don’t need to worry… We’ll handle it…

60
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:08,791
I don’t think he will agree.

61
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:10,541
Who ??? Ranveer? 

62
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,541
Who is he to decide ???

63
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:16,208
There is a board of directors and they will take a decision..

64
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:20,458
And let me remind you Mr Balraj.. that you are not one of them … 

65
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:23,125
You are just a substitute!

66
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:25,708
Nathwani, he is the MD of this company

67
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,791
And Balraj is representing him here

68
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:30,083
Nathwani: Represent?

69
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:33,791
The company is taking a hit on Page 1... ..and on page 3

70
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:36,416
this man is being seen gallivanting !

71
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:42,791
I repeat… he won’t agree!

72
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:47,166
Well it’s absolutely fine if he doesn’t agree… But where the hell is he???

73
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:09,750
Dan: Make it fast guys… 

74
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:13,416
Dan: hurry up... hurry up!

75
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:19,583
Capt. Flight 815: What the hell.. what's happening?

76
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:21,083
Co-pilot Flight 815: Sir, air pressure’s dropping..

77
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:23,083
Capt. Flight 815: What do you mean… Can you confirm??

78
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:25,250
Co-pilot Flight 815: I think we’re flying too low Sir!

79
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,916
Capt. Flight 815: How’s that even possible…it says 36000 feet…

80
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:55,458
Move!

81
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:22,500
Go!

82
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:15,958
Ranveer: Dan!

83
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:20,333
Why so serious???

84
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:23,833
Let’s put a smile on that face…

85
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:32,500
Classic Heath Ledger! Always wanted to say these lines ever since. 

86
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,916
Thanks for the opportunity…

87
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:41,000
Oh this?

88
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,625
Well I could have left with it, 

89
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:47,791
but not thanking your employees is bad manners...

90
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:48,625
and I hate that

91
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,916
So thank you Dan... and good job!

92
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:54,833
Sir!..You shouldn’t have come here!

93
00:09:57,208 --> 00:09:58,916
It’s my dad’s company!

94
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:00,916
I come and go as I wish.

95
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:17,375
Shhh…Shhhh! Hello!

96
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:19,375
Good morning Baby!

97
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:22,208
Just Shut up! Ya baby, you were saying!

98
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:24,750
Give me a kiss no!

99
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:26,791
What Baby?

100
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:30,000
What’s this Shu… I’m just asking for a kiss!

101
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,416
Come on, give it to me fast!

102
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:33,125
Just a minute!.. Bloody…

103
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:36,041
What’s all this noise? 

104
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:42,833
What the hell! This Paper… again!

105
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:45,875
How many times do I have to deal with this?

106
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:48,125
Now how do I clean this Sh..?

107
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:50,458
Baby! Listen..listen Baby! Hear me out…

108
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:53,791
Stop Babying me… are you not satisfied with one?

109
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:56,375
Ranveer: Let me explain myself…you are not letting me speak…

110
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:57,750
Ranveer: I can explain about the paper

111
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:00,958
Listen, I was coming from the left, she was coming from the right..

112
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:03,875
She was wearing high heels, she tripped on me…

113
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:05,666
and the paparazzi printed the same photo in the paper

114
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:09,166
Paparazzi? Paparazzi??? 

115
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:12,666
You want to blame the paparazzi for this?

116
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:14,125
But…

117
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,875
Move… Move.. Move!

118
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:25,458
Move… Move.. Move guys…Move!

119
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:29,833
You know what? You’re going to die today… 

120
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:34,166
and I am not saying this… you can happily blame the Paparazzi for this too..

121
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,875
But.. what’s all that noise? Where are you?

122
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:40,416
I am in a meeting!

123
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:45,375
Ya right! And the board members are on the treadmill with you!

124
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:52,750
How’s that possible! They are not that fit!

125
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:59,208
Listen! Promise me… that you’ll come back in the evening and make up for this

126
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:01,333
I am sorry baby! I have another meeting in the evening!

127
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:03,083
Fantastic! Then I have a lot of time… 

128
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:06,250
 Then I have a lot of time… 

129
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:09,291
and I have a lovely surprise waiting for you…

130
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:14,583
And this time you are never going to forget to tell me before you leave…

131
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:23,166
What are you saying? I left a voice note for you

132
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:28,083
What? Where?

133
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:29,791
Right there...

134
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:39,458
Hi Baby! I am so sorry..I had to leave in a rush…

135
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:41,458
Your Tuesday workout playlist is ready… 

136
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:44,583
And your coffee is exactly where you like it to be…

137
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:53,125
All that is really nice! But where do you have the time for me?

138
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:56,708
I don’t want this part of being Bruce Wayne’s girlfriend.

139
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:59,958
At least Mary Jane and Pepper Potts had something to do…

140
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:02,375
you know what Bruce Wayne’s girlfriend did?.... NOTHING!

141
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:04,708
Really Baby!

142
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:10,458
I am still talking to you in this situation and you feel I don’t have any time for you.

143
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:13,083
Ishita: How would you have the time to spare, all you are bothered about is your meetings…

144
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,958
Ishita: and there is always time if you know how to manage

145
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:22,666
Oh… now I know what’s going on… 

146
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:26,166
Ishita: Now I understand which paper you’ve been talking about… 

147
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:28,333
Ishita: and this is definitely not the paparazzi’s fault…

148
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:44,333
FREEZE!

149
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:47,041
Ishita: Hello? Hello? 

150
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:48,041
Stop!

151
00:13:57,791 --> 00:13:59,791
Give me a min!

152
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:16,166
Hello…Hello Baby! Baby are you there? Hello?

153
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:17,333
Dan: Sir!

154
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:20,458
Your girlfriend is too demanding!

155
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:22,250
Sorry!

156
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:24,708
He better agree with us…

157
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:26,041
He can’t decide alone..

158
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:27,750
At least Mr. Malhotra used to listen to us…

159
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,500
After all, our word also carries some weight…

160
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,000
I think we should wait for him

161
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,333
After all we are stakeholders

162
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:34,750
Ranveer always creates problems for us…

163
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,666
Well… You’re in luck Mr. Nathwani!

164
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:40,541
Ranveer is here to solve all your problems

165
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:45,541
Well... that’s a lot of importance! Relax guys! Take a seat!

166
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:49,500
Well I am sure you guys recognise this black box!

167
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,250
Where did you find it?

168
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:54,833
Khanna uncle… Shahrukh Khan once said…

169
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:57,458
Ranveer: that if you really want something in life… 

170
00:14:57,458 --> 00:15:00,666
the entire universe conspires for you to have it… 

171
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:08,791
And the universe in this case was so sweet to us, 

172
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:10,916
that it landed this in our own warehouse.

173
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:13,583
We’ll have to give it to the employees of Adityaraj Avaiation...

174
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:18,250
Before the evidence could be traced, they brought it back home. 

175
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:20,916
I think we should give them a raise…

176
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:24,791
or maybe... someone has already tipped them…

177
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:27,166
Khanna: This is a very serious matter Ranveer!

178
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:29,958
We must immediately have an internal investigation done.

179
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:32,125
Of course we will, Khanna uncle.

180
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:36,416
But before that… the reason that brought us all here today

181
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,375
Capt. Flight 815: What the hell.. what's happening?

182
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:46,291
Co-pilot Flight 815: Sir, air pressure’s dropping..

183
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:48,291
Capt. Flight 815: What do you mean… Can you confirm??

184
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:50,500
Co-pilot Flight 815: I think we’re flying too low Sir!

185
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,875
Capt. Flight 815: How’s that even possible…it says 36000 feet here..and it doesn’t look…

186
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:55,708
Co-pilot Flight 815: Sir! Look out!

187
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:10,041
The pilots could clearly see the plane flying at 36000ft …
and still it crashed into an 8000 feet high mountain…

188
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:15,333
So Mr. Verma… if the pilots were not asleep…
Who was at fault???

189
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:19,750
The Altimeter …

190
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:24,375
Bang on, Khanna uncle! After a little bit of investigation,
I also came to know …

191
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:31,166
that since the last few years instead of our regular suppliers there is a new
company named Falcon Corporation, that’s been supplying us with these parts.. 

192
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:32,333
because we get them cheaper…

193
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:36,875
well… that’s a very good business decision I must say… 

194
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:47,083
And because of this great business decision…
People died! People lost their lives.. It’s our fault!

195
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:48,666
And now?

196
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:54,666
We cancel all flights functioning with this part …
and inform all the Airlines that we’ll compensate them if we have to…

197
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:57,166
Are you serious?? Have you lost it?

198
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:59,125
It’s 40 years of hard work down the drain!

199
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:00,708
Did you see what happened to Air Going?

200
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:03,250
Hardik: These days even if a single passenger has an issue…
the stocks come tumbling down

201
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,833
Avinash: And we are talking about re-calling all the planes..

202
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:07,041
Our stocks have already plunged 300 points
We’ll lose everything!

203
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:09,666
Instead of the Airlines, compensate the families of the victims…

204
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:11,333
2 million! 3 million! Give them more if you want… 

205
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:28,333
I had an eleven year old son… Who was on his first school trip …I WANT JUSTICE!

206
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:35,875
My son and daughter-in-law were on their honeymoon… 

207
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:39,958
who knew that was the last time I was seeing them..

208
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:47,500
I am all alone now... I have nothing to live for…

209
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:58,541
So Mr. Nathwani, if your son was on that plane,
how much compensation would you have agreed to?

210
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:09,166
Mr. Khan! can you convince this woman that the stock price of your company
is more important than the life of her son and daughter-in-law???

211
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:17,416
Sameer! You lost your father last year right?
How many millions can make up for your loss???

212
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:24,333
Adityaraj Aviation was built by one man, alone,
based on his principles and hard work. 

213
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:28,583
If those principles can’t be followed, then this company is worth nothing.

214
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:36,333
I’ll convince the investors… and whoever is accompanying me to Dubai,
will keep their mouths shut… we’ll also issue a press statement from there

215
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:44,791
Can you please book these extraordinary gentlemen on a safe flight?
Because I know they don’t, but I do care for human lives…

216
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:50,500
Khanna Uncle… Can you please send the papers
of the Falcon Corporation deal to the Phoenix?

217
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:51,916
Yes!

218
00:18:51,916 --> 00:19:01,000
And just one last thing… whoever sanctioned this deal…
I am gonna… See you boys in Dubai!

219
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:09,208
So gentlemen… Any airline preferences?

220
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:18,750
Oops! An entire action sequence would have been wasted…
Shall we?

221
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:43,250
Hold on…

222
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:48,875
What the hell is this ???
Why on earth are we paying these buggers such fat salaries..??? Huh ???

223
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:50,416
Sir we tried to stop him… but…

224
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:53,416
Shut up! Idiots! Good for nothing…

225
00:19:56,583 --> 00:20:04,958
And you Mister…Have you ever seen the MD of a company
get into fist fights with goons..? When is this going to stop?

226
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:06,958
The day you take charge of the company…

227
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:10,958
Not again !…Tch.. Son you don’t understand

228
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:18,041
You don’t understand Dadda… You remember as a child, when I used
to take the cycle out for a spin… and get hurt?… What did dad do?

229
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:21,458
Your father used to lock up the cycle in the garage..

230
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:22,541
But?

231
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:28,583
But… you used to sneak out in the night, steal someone’s cycle
and go for a ride… and again come back with bruises...

232
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:33,541
So Exactly! You can take away my toys … but can’t stop me from playing…

233
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:35,250
That’s fine Son! …but you need to be care...

234
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,250
Will you stop behaving like Aunt May???

235
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,500
oho! Just-

236
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:43,583
Wow!!! Now that’s a mean machine !!!  The Phoenix…

237
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:53,500
Dad really put his heart and soul into designing it…

238
00:20:53,500 --> 00:21:04,958
Yup! Your father was an excellent pilot… but a better human being…
Look! He treated this servant like his own brother…

239
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:06,958
Stop this will you???

240
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:17,000
He always said… Hey Ballu! one day
Adityaraj Aviation will make the best planes in the world…

241
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:27,916
I miss him ….Had he been alive today …he would have taught these thugs a lesson...

242
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:35,208
Don’t worry Dadda! you don’t need the High school Principal to handle
these kids… This class President is good enough for them…

243
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:39,875
But I promise you… I won't let him down…

244
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:58,625
I know son… I had found a brother… and then lost him….
but he gave this bachelor a son… please take care of him…

245
00:21:58,625 --> 00:22:10,708
Dadda… If you wanna really see me fly… go raise the limits of your sky …

246
00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:13,458
Dad always used to say this…

247
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:21,583
Son..once you come back… we’ll go visit the Gurudwara…

248
00:22:21,583 --> 00:22:24,125
Can’t expect a cocktail party from you ..Can I?

249
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:35,083
What happened? Lovers tiff?

250
00:22:35,083 --> 00:22:39,833
Is it my fault if someone printed a nasty picture of me in the newspapers ?

251
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:44,291
Of course they would want a young, handsome and
smart celebrity instead of oldies to grace their tabloids… 

252
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:46,166
Of course…

253
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:47,666
Trust issues…

254
00:22:48,583 --> 00:22:50,583
Mollify her…

255
00:22:50,583 --> 00:22:54,708
She is your favourite… why don’t you do it…
And did I tell you… you are not travelling with me?

256
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:59,916
Of course I know… We need someone keep an eye on these thugs

257
00:22:59,916 --> 00:23:05,750
Wow! You really are Aunty May … You already know what I want

258
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:13,208
In any case, there are two beautiful hot girls waiting for me out there…
why would I want you to spoil my fun…

259
00:23:14,125 --> 00:23:22,875
Sure.. You can only talk. How do I put it in your lingo …
You are all fart… but no Shit!

260
00:23:22,916 --> 00:23:28,541
Sense of humor? Not bad… Not bad at all!

261
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:36,583
Oh..Relax… Take care! 

262
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,291
Sir!

263
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:41,166
Thank you!

264
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:42,958
Have a safe flight son!

265
00:23:54,125 --> 00:23:56,708
Hello ladies…
Lily: Sir, may I?

266
00:23:56,708 --> 00:23:58,666
Ranveer: You better keep it safe…

267
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,166
Am I late?
Just by 2 hours…

268
00:24:01,166 --> 00:24:02,541
Bang on time!

269
00:24:22,666 --> 00:24:24,666
 ‘Vash Napitok…’. Your drink Sir!

270
00:24:24,666 --> 00:24:26,666
Dasvidaniya!

271
00:24:26,666 --> 00:24:28,375
It means Goodbye… 

272
00:24:28,375 --> 00:24:30,375
Can’t blame me for trying!

273
00:24:32,541 --> 00:24:34,541
Are you trying to cheat with Mr. Balraj?? 

274
00:24:35,833 --> 00:24:38,000
Why are the girls not trusting me today?

275
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,375
This game is going on for years…

276
00:24:40,375 --> 00:24:42,375
You’ve also been around for years sweetheart…

277
00:24:43,833 --> 00:24:47,458
You know what? you can’t even make coffee without me in this plane…

278
00:24:47,458 --> 00:24:51,625
Hey! Don’t try to take advantage of my weakness…
And just by the way… How was your father’s surgery??

279
00:24:51,875 --> 00:24:54,416
He's fine!!!... You’ve already asked 3 times!!! 

280
00:24:54,416 --> 00:24:57,666
Hey… Hey… I just wanted to make sure you did not
splurge my money on your boyfriend.

281
00:24:58,541 --> 00:25:02,208
You’ll never change… I’ve got to go check on the Captain 

282
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:04,083
Ok!

283
00:25:04,458 --> 00:25:07,666
And just by the way… I’m going to go and get my own olives 

284
00:25:31,125 --> 00:25:36,333
In a world dealing with water shortage, we have the audacity to use bathtubs…

285
00:25:36,333 --> 00:25:37,750
Sorry?

286
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:39,458
Nothing… you’re looking beautiful!

287
00:25:39,458 --> 00:25:41,333
Thank You!

288
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:45,291
Excuse me Sir! you had requested for some documents to be sent over?

289
00:25:45,291 --> 00:25:46,916
Thank you so much sweetheart!
You’re welcome

290
00:25:47,291 --> 00:25:49,458
Capt. Sanyal: Good afternoon Mr. Malhotra,
we request you to take your seat so that we can prepare for take off…

291
00:25:49,458 --> 00:25:53,125
We request you to take your seat so that we can prepare for take off…

292
00:25:53,125 --> 00:25:55,125
Ok… ok… I’m on my way!

293
00:25:57,458 --> 00:26:02,000
I am on my seat captain. Any more orders for me?

294
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,791
No exchange of pleasantries today?... What’s the matter?
Not in a good mood or you didn’t get your salary on time ??

295
00:26:05,791 --> 00:26:08,708
No Sir, We are already late for departure… that’s why in a hurry.

296
00:26:09,166 --> 00:26:12,625
Ok but don’t overspeed… Lots of crashes happening these days…

297
00:26:12,708 --> 00:26:16,083
Not at all Sir… I’ll personally come and meet you once we take off

298
00:26:16,125 --> 00:26:21,291
Don’t do that… Who’ll fly the plane if you leave the cockpit!!
Just kidding… Anything else for me??

299
00:26:21,916 --> 00:26:23,666
Um… Please fasten your seatbelt Sir!

300
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:26,291
He’s definitely in a bad mood

301
00:26:46,291 --> 00:26:49,041
Jennifer: Mr. Malhotra, welcome aboard the Phoenix. 

302
00:26:49,041 --> 00:26:52,625
Before your departure may we have your attention,
while our cabin crew demonstrate the safety features.

303
00:26:52,625 --> 00:26:54,291
It’s for your safety!

304
00:26:54,291 --> 00:26:59,791
Jennifer: To fasten the seatbelt, insert the metal end
into the buckle as the cabin crew is demonstrating. 

305
00:26:59,791 --> 00:27:04,166
Jennifer: To secure the seat belt, pull the loose end of the
strap. To open, flip the buckle cover away from you.

306
00:27:18,208 --> 00:27:19,250
Excuse me Sir!

307
00:27:21,666 --> 00:27:24,250
Can I have your drink? We’re about to take off

308
00:27:27,833 --> 00:27:30,875
You shouldn’t drink at work sweetheart!

309
00:27:42,333 --> 00:27:48,833
Capt. Sanyal: Once again a very good afternoon Mr. Malhotra! Me, Capt. Sanyal,
co-pilot Sharma, along with the cabin crew are here to serve you.

310
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:55,708
Capt. Sanyal: Once the aircraft is airborne and steady at 40,000ft, you will be able to use your electronic equipment like your mobile phone and  laptop.

311
00:27:55,708 --> 00:28:01,875
Capt. Sanyal: We will take approx. 3 hours and 10 min to touchdown at the Dubai airport.

312
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:19,708
OK!

313
00:28:23,541 --> 00:28:25,666
Cabin crew… prepare to take-off!

314
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:29,250
Capt. Sanyal:We are already late for departure..
That’s why in a hurry..

315
00:31:32,458 --> 00:31:34,750
Captain… Captain!!

316
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Sanyal!!! Sharma...Can you hear me!!!???

317
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,208
Why is no one responding????

318
00:31:50,541 --> 00:31:59,000
Captain???... Captain???
Is everything OK? All fine? Captain...

319
00:32:01,708 --> 00:32:05,375
Why can’t I remember?… take off…

320
00:32:13,083 --> 00:32:16,208
We should have landed by now…

321
00:32:18,375 --> 00:32:20,166
You can’t even make coffee without me in this plane

322
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,500
Lily!!

323
00:33:43,708 --> 00:33:44,875
Cmon ! Cmon !

324
00:33:56,916 --> 00:33:58,291
God..damnit !...

325
00:35:55,708 --> 00:35:59,000
Dasvidaniya!

326
00:36:51,375 --> 00:37:00,083
Okay boys! Look who’s back! Look I know both of you are involved…
because it’s really difficult to hop on to a plane after take off…

327
00:37:00,083 --> 00:37:06,041
unless you’re Tom Cruise !
And definitely you’ve been paid a lot of money for this… 

328
00:37:06,041 --> 00:37:10,833
so much money that post this assignment, Sharma is going
to buy a Yacht in Malibu…and Sanyal...

329
00:37:10,833 --> 00:37:16,000
You will be chilling in Brazil with the hottest women on the beach sipping martinis.

330
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:24,541
And going by Sherlock’s theory of deduction… This has been done by people who
don’t want me to expose the truth behind FLIGHT 815…

331
00:37:24,541 --> 00:37:33,875
I mean this is not rocket science… cmon!
But since you killed those innocent girls, and I’m still alive…

332
00:37:33,875 --> 00:37:42,833
I’m sure there is something more you need from me…
So tell me… How can I help you guys? What can I do for you?

333
00:37:44,833 --> 00:37:57,500
C'mon… tell me… What happened? Say it… C’mon… Say it …Damn!

334
00:39:01,458 --> 00:39:10,166
Look… I know you guys can hear me…
so let me make this simple… I own a 500 billion dollar company… 

335
00:39:10,166 --> 00:39:24,083
You’ll spend the rest of your life counting the number of zeros in 500 billion dollars…
So just name your price… Tell me!!! Say it! Say it… Say… Say it!!

336
00:39:24,083 --> 00:39:34,583
What on earth do you want!!!... You want the money???..
You want the company!!!... Or you want me to kiss you!!??????

337
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:38,833
Say something… Say it!

338
00:39:50,375 --> 00:39:56,333
Maybe this is voice-activated… voice activated… yes!!
Phoenix... open the door!

339
00:40:01,333 --> 00:40:09,291
Open Sesame… Open… Open it… arrr… open damn it … 

340
00:40:09,291 --> 00:40:16,416
Ok..ok..ok! Woosha …woosha ..woosha ..

341
00:40:16,416 --> 00:40:25,250
Ok… I have an idea… The moment we land in Dubai…
We’ll go to the Burj Khalifa and discuss this over drinks and dinner? 

342
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:32,083
What say?..No?... ok!... In fact, I’ll gift you the Burj Khalifa… No?

343
00:40:32,083 --> 00:40:39,708
Tell me.. Say something.. say it… speak up…
speak up god damn it open the door…

344
00:41:16,625 --> 00:41:21,666
Cmon… cmon… cmon… May day… May day… May day… Cmon!

345
00:41:23,875 --> 00:41:26,041
Hey man! Someone pick up the phone? 

346
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:35,958
Anybody there??? … 

347
00:41:39,458 --> 00:41:41,500
You’re the military… you guys should respond at least!

348
00:41:57,791 --> 00:42:00,708
Cmon! C’mon… somebody pick up the phone!

349
00:42:04,083 --> 00:42:09,250
Okay Okay okay… Okay Okay okay okay okay!!!
I’ve stopped!

350
00:42:13,791 --> 00:42:17,708
Damn Bro! I had no clue pilots could make the plane bounce like that

351
00:42:19,541 --> 00:42:22,041
C’mon I’m getting bored, I need someone to talk to…

352
00:42:35,958 --> 00:42:37,958
Afternoon…

353
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,541
Good afternoon Ladies and gentlemen! Welcome aboard the Phoenix!

354
00:42:46,541 --> 00:42:54,541
Take a deep breath… and look outside the window…
You’ll be able to spot GOD any moment now…

355
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:01,625
No need to fasten your seatbelts… because our destiny
is far more screwed than this plane.

356
00:43:02,291 --> 00:43:09,791
So sit back… relax… the bar is open… make a drink…
enjoy yourself and get drunk before dying!

357
00:43:09,791 --> 00:43:13,708
Cheers to Sharma and Sanyal!

358
00:43:15,541 --> 00:43:21,208
(SINGING PATRIOTIC SONG)

359
00:43:21,208 --> 00:43:25,166
Sanyal… don’t stand up, it’s not the National Anthem!!

360
00:43:26,875 --> 00:43:28,375
(CONTINUES SINGING)

361
00:43:33,916 --> 00:43:35,916
What was that??? Hello…

362
00:43:42,916 --> 00:43:49,166
You bloody Sanyal… What the heck are you trying to do???
Stop playing basketball with the damn plane and speak up!!

363
00:43:53,541 --> 00:44:01,333
Look… This is my last warning… I swear won’t tell anyone you tried to kill me…
Pinky swear! So stop this shit and get the hell out!

364
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:09,041
You won’t come out right?… then I am coming in…

365
00:46:58,333 --> 00:47:02,583
Open it damn it… why don’t you open the door… 

366
00:47:02,583 --> 00:47:10,833
Ranveer: What’s your problem ?? Say something!
Speak up!!! Why don’t you open it?

367
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:03,833
Hi Baby! I think these are my last words… 

368
00:48:03,833 --> 00:48:08,791
You said I was going to die today… and here I am! 

369
00:48:08,791 --> 00:48:17,416
I wish I had replied to your last message…
I wish I could attend to one more of your complaining calls

370
00:48:19,458 --> 00:48:25,375
I don’t even know if you’ll get this message… But if you do… 

371
00:48:25,375 --> 00:48:32,541
Please don’t try and find me in someone else…
because to find a person as smart and handsome as me is just not possible

372
00:50:39,708 --> 00:50:41,333
Khanna: Ranveer Malhotra…

373
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:48,791
Khanna: Ranveer Malhotra… The M.D of Adityaraj Aviation…

374
00:50:50,041 --> 00:51:01,916
Faith and principles were words that his father…
late Mr. Adityaraj left behind… and Ranveer represented that legacy. 

375
00:51:01,916 --> 00:51:10,583
But with a heavy heart, I wish to inform you that he passed away in a plane crash today.

376
00:51:14,458 --> 00:51:32,000
After an internal investigation, we’ve discovered that he had
signed some fraudulent deals which resulted in the tragedy called Flight 815.

377
00:51:34,583 --> 00:51:42,208
His decision not only harmed the company
but also resulted in the loss of many innocent lives.

378
00:51:42,208 --> 00:51:54,416
On behalf of the entire staff of Adityaraj Aviation
I apologise for all the losses caused.

379
00:51:54,416 --> 00:52:02,250
We will try to the best of our capabilities to
compensate everyone for this tragic loss.

380
00:52:02,250 --> 00:52:08,083
May his soul rest in peace…

381
00:52:17,875 --> 00:52:19,875
How did you find the rehearsal?

382
00:52:22,041 --> 00:52:27,291
… of the press conference that I am going to have in
Dubai in the evening… Nice no?

383
00:52:30,125 --> 00:52:35,833
Oh yeah! I wonder if you’ll ever be able to see this video…
I don’t know… 

384
00:52:38,041 --> 00:52:41,791
I think you‘ll watch it… you’ll watch it for sure 

385
00:52:43,250 --> 00:52:49,000
Khanna: You are really thick skinned, exactly like your father… you won’t die so soon

386
00:52:51,916 --> 00:53:00,750
Oh yeah… what was that you said???… One man…
who built this company… alone… on the basis of his principles… One man?

387
00:53:01,875 --> 00:53:06,208
Alone?? So were we f…

388
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:10,500
Alone? Alone my foot!!

389
00:53:13,375 --> 00:53:19,833
What principles are you talking about?...
What did you watch on TV last night?… 

390
00:53:20,125 --> 00:53:25,291
You turned the boardroom into a bloody sitcom…

391
00:53:27,125 --> 00:53:33,083
All your father did was preach. We ran this company…
we made it what it is today… do u understand?

392
00:53:34,666 --> 00:53:40,000
All alone… in a room I would get frustrated… I used to scream by myself… 

393
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,958
Here comes another idiot after his father, preaching to us about principles… and today?

394
00:53:44,708 --> 00:53:51,541
and today?… Today you just crossed all limits… ha ha fooling around with bloody wires…

395
00:53:59,333 --> 00:54:03,791
Oh yeah …yeah... you must be wondering how we managed to pull this off?

396
00:54:04,041 --> 00:54:07,916
Let me tell you and help you die in peace…

397
00:54:09,833 --> 00:54:11,875
We found an excellent pilot…

398
00:54:15,041 --> 00:54:18,125
Khanna: Who would switch your favourite drink…

399
00:54:29,625 --> 00:54:33,875
And then kill the co-pilot …

400
00:54:40,916 --> 00:54:46,291
Khanna: Block all communications, change the flight route… And shift the plane to Autopilot

401
00:54:49,666 --> 00:54:53,333
Khanna: And shift the plane to Autopilot

402
00:55:00,541 --> 00:55:05,375
Finish off the Cabin crew…
So that there is no one to help you

403
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:40,541
Then take all the evidence and leave you all alone…

404
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:16,416
…and you were thinking this was a hijack???

405
00:57:18,833 --> 00:57:23,500
C’mon… How cheap do you think we are?

406
00:57:27,291 --> 00:57:29,291
Think beyond… 

407
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,750
Think big!

408
00:57:33,333 --> 00:57:41,125
We’ll put you in your father’s plane and turn you into ashes at 30,000 feet..

409
00:57:43,333 --> 00:57:48,791
And guess what… missing planes are trending these days!

410
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:55,541
And now I’ll rightly take what was mine… 

411
00:57:55,541 --> 00:58:05,458
With one foot on your father’s grave
and the other on the news of you never returning back

412
00:58:10,125 --> 00:58:12,125
Thank you!

413
00:58:13,208 --> 00:58:17,375
Such is life… Ranveer… Such is life! 

414
00:58:18,958 --> 00:58:20,958
Cheers! 

415
00:58:27,541 --> 00:58:30,416
Enjoy the Flight!

416
00:59:19,375 --> 00:59:23,541
Sir… Sir the last message was relayed at 12:00am, before exiting Mumbai airspace…

417
00:59:23,833 --> 00:59:25,708
everything was normal.

418
00:59:26,125 --> 00:59:29,750
We have put all the airports on the flight route of Phoenix on radio alert…

419
00:59:29,750 --> 00:59:33,458
They are also checking, but no emergency SOS message has been received anywhere…

420
00:59:33,458 --> 00:59:35,416
Sir, we are doing our best.

421
00:59:39,208 --> 00:59:41,166
Do you see our plane out there?

422
00:59:43,333 --> 00:59:44,291
Do you????

423
00:59:44,291 --> 00:59:45,333
Umm… no sir

424
00:59:45,333 --> 00:59:48,583
So save the story of your best efforts for your seniors.

425
00:59:48,750 --> 00:59:51,458
Sir, we have engaged our best teams in this search operation

426
00:59:51,458 --> 00:59:54,791
The world's most important plane is missing from your airspace…

427
00:59:54,791 --> 00:59:57,041
and your team is working like nothing’s happened!!

428
00:59:57,041 --> 00:59:58,875
This is your best team? 

429
00:59:59,750 --> 01:00:02,500
I’m surprised you continue to expect from them. 

430
01:00:07,250 --> 01:00:09,541
Excuse me Miss! What do we have?

431
01:00:09,541 --> 01:00:10,750
Greetings sir.

432
01:00:11,166 --> 01:00:16,375
This is the last radio message
sent from your aircraft to Mumbai ATC at 12:00hrs.

433
01:00:18,375 --> 01:00:24,541
Captain: VICTOR TANGO Phoenix 461 GLF6 Alpha, to Control.

442
01:00:52,958 --> 01:00:53,875
Have a safe flight. 

443
01:00:54,166 --> 01:00:55,250
Wilco. Out.

444
01:01:00,583 --> 01:01:01,375
That’s it??

445
01:01:01,583 --> 01:01:02,333
Yes sir…

446
01:01:02,750 --> 01:01:07,583
As per schedule… they should have radioed us an hour ago… but…

447
01:01:07,583 --> 01:01:08,916
...there has been nothing.

448
01:01:13,583 --> 01:01:14,958
Thank you!

449
01:01:23,916 --> 01:01:28,291
I want crew lists, check-in documents, pre-flight check reports, security camera feeds…

450
01:01:28,291 --> 01:01:32,125
anything and everything that we have on that flight’s record… and I need it immediately. 

451
01:01:32,125 --> 01:01:32,833
Yes Sir!

452
01:01:32,833 --> 01:01:36,250
And whoever is on that plane… I need their history… 

453
01:01:36,250 --> 01:01:38,166
if it doesn't exist… dig it out!

454
01:01:38,208 --> 01:01:38,875
Yes Sir!

455
01:01:38,875 --> 01:01:39,666
One last thing… 

456
01:01:39,666 --> 01:01:42,875
Till we find the Phoenix… This information remains inside this room.

457
01:01:43,291 --> 01:01:44,041
Is it clear??

458
01:01:44,041 --> 01:01:44,583
Yes Sir!

459
01:01:44,583 --> 01:01:45,333
Now move!

460
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:29,250
Okay… those were not my last words… 

461
01:02:30,750 --> 01:02:31,750
I’m still alive…

462
01:02:32,958 --> 01:02:34,375
...playing golf…

463
01:02:35,083 --> 01:02:36,250
...getting bored!!

464
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:40,750
Ignore the golf playing part… 

465
01:02:44,125 --> 01:02:45,833
But what else should I do?? 

466
01:02:46,166 --> 01:02:48,541
What an excellent plan Uncle! 

467
01:02:49,708 --> 01:02:50,916
He could’ve kidnapped me, 

468
01:02:51,458 --> 01:02:54,375
burnt me, shot me! Would have cost him nothing! 

469
01:02:54,666 --> 01:02:56,583
I mean… the oldest trick in the book…

470
01:02:56,583 --> 01:02:58,833
The world's most tried and tested plan…

471
01:02:58,833 --> 01:02:59,750
Bomb!

472
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,750
Just blow me up with a bomb! But no… 

473
01:03:02,250 --> 01:03:03,416
‘let’s frustrate him!’

474
01:03:04,375 --> 01:03:06,666
There are more ways to frustrate a person

475
01:03:08,291 --> 01:03:10,000
I mean I understand revenge…

476
01:03:10,583 --> 01:03:12,250
Iron Man 1, Iron Man 2…

477
01:03:12,250 --> 01:03:13,583
completely understand that…

478
01:03:14,375 --> 01:03:15,416
but the plane???

479
01:03:16,583 --> 01:03:20,250
If you ever meet him… please ask him this…
Does he even know how expensive this plane is?

480
01:03:30,541 --> 01:03:33,166
He had to give a long speech didn't he?

481
01:03:33,166 --> 01:03:36,208
but why the hell did he need to tell me there is no pilot in the cockpit! 

482
01:03:36,333 --> 01:03:38,125
Now who will fly the plane???

483
01:03:38,125 --> 01:03:40,041
And who will I chit-chat with???   

484
01:05:28,666 --> 01:05:32,208
Our plane took off from Mumbai to Dubai.

485
01:05:33,833 --> 01:05:37,375
This is where the Phoenix sent it’s last radio message from…

486
01:05:38,583 --> 01:05:41,750
and at this point… the Phoenix went off the radar.

487
01:05:42,208 --> 01:05:47,000
On a good day, the plane should’ve flown this route… 

488
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,083
and should’ve landed here by now.

489
01:05:49,083 --> 01:05:51,208
But that clearly did not happen.

490
01:05:51,541 --> 01:05:56,000
Between Mumbai and Dubai, there are a thousand radio towers along the coast
belonging to several countries… 

491
01:05:56,166 --> 01:06:02,458
if the plane had to go anywhere near them… they would’ve picked up something.

492
01:06:02,458 --> 01:06:04,291
But they’ve got nothing either.

493
01:06:04,583 --> 01:06:10,666
Which means our plane has gone off course and has drifted towards the sea…

494
01:06:11,083 --> 01:06:13,000
and whatever happened to the Phoenix… 

495
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:16,416
happened between these two points.  

496
01:06:17,208 --> 01:06:17,791
Shoot!

497
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:22,333
Pre-taxi check reports confirm all technical specifications as ‘updated’

498
01:06:22,416 --> 01:06:27,833
Sir.. hydraulics, pressurization, transponder, electrical and autopilot features were functional

499
01:06:27,833 --> 01:06:30,125
Emergency equipment was also in place.

500
01:06:30,125 --> 01:06:34,541
Sir, as per the air traffic controller on duty, the take off was recorded as ‘smooth’…

501
01:06:34,541 --> 01:06:37,416
but his duty changed 15 minutes after the take off.

502
01:06:37,416 --> 01:06:40,708
Interestingly, the controller who took the next shift never saw the plane on his screen. 

503
01:06:40,708 --> 01:06:44,583
Sir I think the plane went off the radar during their changeover. 

504
01:06:45,416 --> 01:06:51,541
Because during the changeover… there is a 5 to 10 seconds
window of ‘no eyes’ on the screen.  

505
01:06:51,666 --> 01:06:52,458
And the Pilot?

506
01:06:52,458 --> 01:06:55,666
Captain Sanjay Sanyal… with 1st Officer P.K. Sharma. 

507
01:06:56,041 --> 01:06:58,416
Their check-in security feeds have just come in…

508
01:07:09,458 --> 01:07:10,250
Stop!

509
01:07:35,750 --> 01:07:39,333
Capt. Sanyal is holidaying in Venice with his family right now…

510
01:07:42,625 --> 01:07:44,666
This photograph was taken 4 hours ago… 

511
01:07:46,291 --> 01:07:49,416
Exactly at the same time when the Phoenix was taking off.

512
01:07:51,916 --> 01:07:53,291
So Gentlemen… 

513
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,791
our plane is not lost… 

514
01:07:59,333 --> 01:08:00,541
it’s been made to vanish

515
01:08:00,541 --> 01:08:01,333
What?

516
01:08:42,125 --> 01:08:43,625
Wow!… What a wish… 

517
01:08:45,083 --> 01:08:47,208
I should’ve asked for something better.

518
01:08:47,625 --> 01:08:51,291
If this is what you wanted to do… Why beat around the bush? 

519
01:08:51,791 --> 01:08:54,291
I mean... Why all this drama?

520
01:08:55,291 --> 01:08:57,791
Whoosha! Whoosha! Whoosha! 

521
01:08:57,916 --> 01:09:00,416
Focus Ranveer focus! Focus…

522
01:09:00,583 --> 01:09:03,041
Okay… my favourite color…

523
01:09:03,041 --> 01:09:06,833
ah.. Grey? Green? Red?

524
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,208
Maybe matching colors?

525
01:09:11,458 --> 01:09:12,666
Matching matching?

526
01:09:13,041 --> 01:09:16,416
It's a red colored cylinder… so the red wire?…

527
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,208
how do I… 

528
01:09:19,375 --> 01:09:23,541
Damn!… Tony Stark would have flown off into space with this thing by now.

529
01:09:24,166 --> 01:09:27,291
That’s your problem… Hurtlocker was the film to watch…

530
01:09:27,291 --> 01:09:31,458
at least you would’ve learnt to diffuse a bomb…
so much so for a being superhero fan boy.

531
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:32,875
Ok…

532
01:09:36,083 --> 01:09:38,291
I think my family reunion in hell just got confirmed. 

533
01:09:53,333 --> 01:09:56,083
Shut up!... Shut Up. Shut Up!

534
01:10:42,750 --> 01:10:43,708
Sir...

535
01:10:44,125 --> 01:10:46,708
Hmm… thank you… Match this with that one… okay?… 

536
01:10:47,833 --> 01:10:48,625
Sir...

537
01:10:49,166 --> 01:10:52,208
25mins after the Phoenix went off our radars,

538
01:10:52,208 --> 01:10:56,875
a military base radar in Somalia spotted an unidentified aircraft. 

539
01:10:57,166 --> 01:10:59,583
They tried to contact the flight crew, 

540
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:03,083
but lost the plane again before any communication.

541
01:11:04,375 --> 01:11:05,750
Somalia??

542
01:11:14,666 --> 01:11:16,625
My hunch was right.

543
01:11:16,791 --> 01:11:19,416
Sir we’re not sure it was the Phoenix

544
01:11:20,416 --> 01:11:22,000
Did you get what I asked for?

545
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,791
Yes Sir. The office received an email this morning from Capt. Sanyal…

546
01:11:24,791 --> 01:11:28,500
saying he was back from his holiday and was ready to fly immediately. 

547
01:11:28,916 --> 01:11:31,625
His fit-to-fly reports were already submitted.

548
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:38,333
He was our regular pilot who flew the Phoenix,
so the other stand-by pilot was relieved from his duty.

549
01:11:39,750 --> 01:11:43,083
We traced the Captain’s email… It came from our office.

550
01:11:44,708 --> 01:11:49,833
Sir, our security department also received a
‘lost Pilot ID’ complaint from Capt. Sanyal this morning. 

551
01:11:50,875 --> 01:11:51,625
And?

552
01:11:51,666 --> 01:11:53,541
Security issued a duplicate ID immediately.  

553
01:11:53,791 --> 01:11:55,166
Without verification?

554
01:11:55,333 --> 01:11:56,708
Sir, the order came directly-

555
01:11:57,916 --> 01:11:59,375
Wait a minute… let me guess… 

556
01:12:00,166 --> 01:12:03,791
that order too came directly from our office. 

557
01:12:04,958 --> 01:12:05,916
Yes sir.

558
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:07,583
Sir, there’s one more thing…

559
01:12:07,708 --> 01:12:09,625
Ya c'mon… Surprise me!

560
01:12:09,833 --> 01:12:13,750
The Captain also got into an argument with the airport staff at the security check...

561
01:12:13,750 --> 01:12:15,541
when the staff asked for his baggage to be scanned-  

562
01:12:15,541 --> 01:12:16,625
Tell me something...

563
01:12:18,583 --> 01:12:19,916
...the co-pilot… what was his name?

564
01:12:19,916 --> 01:12:21,000
P.K. Sharma

565
01:12:21,541 --> 01:12:24,791
How did he not know that the Captain was not Captain. Sanyal? 

566
01:12:24,958 --> 01:12:26,708
Sir… this is his first flight

567
01:12:27,708 --> 01:12:31,416
Sir we need to alert the authorities, dispatch teams, start a search op-

568
01:12:31,416 --> 01:12:33,041
No no no no no no no no...

569
01:12:33,916 --> 01:12:36,375
If the plane is really hijacked…

570
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:41,541
then whoever planned this… 

571
01:12:43,250 --> 01:12:45,666
is waiting to hear some news about it 

572
01:12:45,875 --> 01:12:50,750
And we’re not going to give it to them till we know ourselves… 

573
01:12:50,750 --> 01:12:52,041
so hold it!

574
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,083
Have the board members arrived?

575
01:12:54,333 --> 01:12:56,916
Yes Sir. Investors are scheduled to meet in about 20 minutes from now.

576
01:12:56,916 --> 01:12:58,833
Ok. Listen up… You go there and...

577
01:13:00,166 --> 01:13:04,750
Do not let the meeting start till I reach there. 

578
01:13:05,041 --> 01:13:05,708
Yes Sir!

579
01:13:45,833 --> 01:13:47,041
Shizz

580
01:20:09,583 --> 01:20:12,625
Cmon cmon cmon Cmon cmon cmon cmon!

581
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:27,666
Get out, Get out, out!

582
01:20:38,166 --> 01:20:40,416
Sorry Tom Cruise, I was forced to do this

583
01:22:51,250 --> 01:22:52,666
come on! come on!

584
01:22:53,375 --> 01:22:54,791
come on! come on!

585
01:22:57,750 --> 01:22:59,166
warning, warning, warning

586
01:23:37,916 --> 01:23:39,333
Think Think Think…

587
01:23:45,875 --> 01:23:46,791
May day! May day!

588
01:23:46,791 --> 01:23:47,916
May day! May day! May day!

589
01:23:49,916 --> 01:23:51,041
May day! May day! May day!

590
01:23:51,916 --> 01:23:52,833
May day! May day!

591
01:23:53,708 --> 01:23:54,833
Hello. Hello 

592
01:23:55,375 --> 01:23:56,000
Hello!

593
01:23:57,916 --> 01:23:59,791
Can anybody hear me? 

594
01:24:05,166 --> 01:24:05,833
Shiz!

595
01:26:10,291 --> 01:26:11,833
Oh shi…

596
01:26:40,916 --> 01:26:43,458
Contact…. Abu Dhabi ATC… Hurry up!

597
01:26:45,916 --> 01:26:48,250
Sir… you think he’s still alive?

598
01:26:53,250 --> 01:26:55,583
If you want to really see him fly, 

599
01:26:59,583 --> 01:27:02,458
go raise the limits of your sky.

600
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:07,750
Sir …connected!

601
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:23,916
Yessss!!!!

602
01:27:30,791 --> 01:27:31,708
Oh Shizz!!!!

603
01:27:46,875 --> 01:27:47,791
Sorry!

604
01:27:51,833 --> 01:27:52,750
Hello?… 

605
01:27:53,041 --> 01:27:53,958
Balraj: Hello?… 

606
01:27:54,791 --> 01:27:55,708
Balraj: Hello?… 

607
01:27:56,083 --> 01:27:57,416
Balraj: Hello... Ranveer? 

608
01:27:57,416 --> 01:28:03,375
Balraj: Son… if you’re listening to this,
you need to press down the black button to speak—  

609
01:28:04,166 --> 01:28:06,250
Ranveer: Hello! Hello Dadda can you hear me? Hello?

610
01:28:06,250 --> 01:28:07,500
Hello... Dadda...

611
01:28:09,375 --> 01:28:11,750
Yes… Yes Son, I can…  

612
01:28:15,291 --> 01:28:17,291
How’s the party going?

613
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,583
Party?? It's an orgy up here!

614
01:28:22,500 --> 01:28:23,708
Ranveer: Now don't get all emotional! 

615
01:28:23,958 --> 01:28:28,458
Uncle almost got away with my memorial service plans

616
01:28:28,750 --> 01:28:34,166
Dont worry son… we’ll hold one for them soon

617
01:28:34,166 --> 01:28:35,791
Oh I can't wait for it… 

618
01:28:35,791 --> 01:28:39,250
By the way… you’re welcome. I have 3 dead souls up here.

619
01:28:39,791 --> 01:28:42,500
Had you joined me.. you’d be dead meat. 

620
01:28:43,833 --> 01:28:47,083
Now if we’re done wasting time… will somebody help me!!!

621
01:28:49,291 --> 01:28:51,083
Please…. do something …save him!!!

622
01:28:51,083 --> 01:28:52,333
As-salamu alaikum Sir

623
01:28:53,791 --> 01:28:58,541
Habibi… we can greet each other for the rest of the day
if you can try a little harder to save me first

624
01:28:59,500 --> 01:29:01,125
Just tell him … what’s to be done…

625
01:29:01,125 --> 01:29:02,708
Sir, do you have a chute on board???

626
01:29:02,708 --> 01:29:03,250
What?

627
01:29:03,750 --> 01:29:04,500
A Chute.. .

628
01:29:04,875 --> 01:29:05,416
Seriously?

629
01:29:05,583 --> 01:29:06,750
Chute sir… A Chute!

630
01:29:07,250 --> 01:29:11,000
Ok Listen.. I’m a one woman man… so let's not get too cozy right now

631
01:29:11,291 --> 01:29:13,458
She means Parachute you Idiot! 

632
01:29:13,666 --> 01:29:17,583
If I had one.. I would’ve jumped off long ago…

633
01:29:22,250 --> 01:29:23,791
Then just Auto Eject

634
01:29:28,791 --> 01:29:30,000
Can't do it Dadda… 

635
01:29:30,458 --> 01:29:31,625
I’m flying over a city

636
01:29:31,958 --> 01:29:34,875
You’re asking me to kill hundreds of people to save one life… 

637
01:29:35,541 --> 01:29:37,583
How’re we different from them?  

638
01:29:39,833 --> 01:29:43,833
But your life is very important Ranveer…

639
01:29:44,125 --> 01:29:46,875
What’s important is that we land this plane Dadda

640
01:29:46,875 --> 01:29:50,833
Do whatever you want to do man… just help me land this plane safely.

641
01:29:51,125 --> 01:29:52,500
Can you do something …help him!

642
01:29:52,500 --> 01:29:53,208
Yes Sir...

643
01:29:53,208 --> 01:29:54,791
Dadda! stop flirting with the woman… Hello?…

644
01:29:55,375 --> 01:29:56,500
Sir… listen to me carefully… 

645
01:29:56,500 --> 01:30:00,500
you will need to turn on the transponder so that we can track you. 

646
01:30:02,166 --> 01:30:04,333
Why don't you come up here and show me where it is!

647
01:30:04,750 --> 01:30:06,333
‘Ana la ‘afham
Balraj: Calm down

648
01:30:06,333 --> 01:30:08,666
Habibi I make planes... I don't fly them

649
01:30:09,458 --> 01:30:11,250
Talk me through it step-by-step.

650
01:30:11,416 --> 01:30:15,958
Press the first button to the right of the keypad in front of you.

651
01:30:20,125 --> 01:30:21,541
Okay… he’s online!

652
01:30:21,750 --> 01:30:22,625
Yes!!

653
01:30:22,833 --> 01:30:23,708
Rukhsana:Very good Sir

654
01:30:24,041 --> 01:30:26,666
Now we shall level you off ok?

655
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:31,625
Extend the right wing flaps to 15 degrees, airspeed down to 110knots, 

656
01:30:31,625 --> 01:30:35,125
flip the master and gently push forward on the stick—

657
01:30:35,125 --> 01:30:38,666
‘Ana la ‘afham!!! I don't understand you!!!.. ‘Ana la ‘afham!!!

658
01:30:38,833 --> 01:30:41,625
Sir, your airspeed is increasing rapidly, 

659
01:30:41,625 --> 01:30:44,666
the aircraft will start stalling… this is no time for joke

660
01:30:44,750 --> 01:30:46,750
Exactly! no time for joke! 

661
01:30:46,750 --> 01:30:49,166
Slowly… steadily… Baby-Talk me through this…

662
01:30:49,750 --> 01:30:51,583
You see the Big lever in the center?

663
01:30:53,083 --> 01:30:54,625
Yes yes… Big Bad lever… 

664
01:30:55,208 --> 01:30:57,583
Good! Pull it back slowly… 

665
01:30:59,583 --> 01:31:02,958
...till you see 110N on the display panel

666
01:31:04,750 --> 01:31:07,750
Display panel? There are 4 of them. Which one?

667
01:31:07,750 --> 01:31:09,791
The one with a lot of circles on it!

668
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,750
Oh! You mean the Map Page with the Primary Engine Indicators?

669
01:31:12,916 --> 01:31:13,750
What?

670
01:31:17,250 --> 01:31:19,291
You won't find it there… it’s not part of the standard manual.

671
01:31:21,166 --> 01:31:22,666
Get to the point now!!!!

672
01:31:22,791 --> 01:31:24,791
Now push ahead on the center stick slowly

673
01:31:26,125 --> 01:31:27,041
Okay…

674
01:31:27,416 --> 01:31:29,291
Pushing… Pushing…

675
01:31:32,625 --> 01:31:33,333
Pushing… 

676
01:31:33,333 --> 01:31:35,750
Do you see a panel with blue and brown colors?

677
01:31:35,750 --> 01:31:37,958
I mean the ..pri..Primary Flight Indicator

678
01:31:39,125 --> 01:31:43,083
I see all blue… no brown… no brown.. not even Dan Brown!

679
01:31:43,291 --> 01:31:47,166
You need to keep pushing on the stick till you see half of both the colors… 

680
01:31:47,416 --> 01:31:49,791
Okay okay okay….pushing

681
01:31:57,750 --> 01:31:58,708
Leveled off!  Levelled off!

682
01:31:58,833 --> 01:32:03,375
Very good. Now let go of the center stick… and enter these coordinates into the keypad.

683
01:32:34,791 --> 01:32:37,541
Mr.Ranveer, because you have a breach… 

684
01:32:37,541 --> 01:32:44,041
Please try and maintain the same low altitude of 8000ft, or else there will be a decompressing pressure on the aircraft. 

685
01:32:44,875 --> 01:32:45,375
That means?

686
01:32:46,041 --> 01:32:48,041
That means it’ll explode!

687
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:50,916
Is that a warning or a threat?

688
01:32:51,125 --> 01:32:52,541
It's just information

689
01:32:53,625 --> 01:32:56,500
If I die after all this… it's because of you girl.

690
01:33:18,250 --> 01:33:20,375
Are you out of your mind?

691
01:33:20,375 --> 01:33:22,458
Do you even know what you’re saying?

692
01:33:22,458 --> 01:33:25,458
I pay you half in advance… and I clean up your mess too!!!
How is this working?

693
01:33:25,458 --> 01:33:29,666
If Mr. Khanna found out about this he is going to—

694
01:33:31,083 --> 01:33:35,041
Mr. Khanna… it's the pilot… he wants the rest of his payment

695
01:33:37,583 --> 01:33:39,458
You call yourself a contract killer? 

696
01:33:39,708 --> 01:33:42,375
One man… you could not kill ONE MAN

697
01:33:43,041 --> 01:33:48,166
He’s performing aerial stunts in front of the public out there
and all you care about is your balance payment?

698
01:33:49,416 --> 01:33:52,833
If you ever try to call me again… I will pay twice the amount and have you dead.

699
01:33:53,625 --> 01:33:55,750
Buzz off!! Idiot!

700
01:33:56,208 --> 01:34:00,083
With all due respect Mr. Khanna… we could’ve done it the simple way… 

701
01:34:00,083 --> 01:34:03,000
there was no need for this extravaganza.

702
01:34:03,666 --> 01:34:06,291
Making a black box disappear from a crash site was simple

703
01:34:06,291 --> 01:34:08,916
Don't tell me what's simple when you can't do it yourself.

704
01:34:09,416 --> 01:34:12,041
Don't worry… we still have a chance… 

705
01:34:13,250 --> 01:34:18,500
The bomb worked as a backup. No one can survive that blast. 

706
01:34:18,750 --> 01:34:21,000
Look at the time you idiot…

707
01:34:21,333 --> 01:34:23,583
...the bomb went off 20 minutes ago.

708
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,250
With this boy… it’s not that simple.

709
01:34:31,708 --> 01:34:35,083
I want him dead… I don’t know how…

710
01:34:37,166 --> 01:34:40,041
Sir, the investors are here.

711
01:35:10,416 --> 01:35:13,291
We have a visual!... I repeat… we have a confirmed visual. 

712
01:35:13,291 --> 01:35:14,750
Phoenix approaching runway!

713
01:35:15,791 --> 01:35:17,250
Yes!! Rukhsana!!!

714
01:35:19,125 --> 01:35:21,166
Dispatch emergency services to runway no: 3

715
01:35:21,166 --> 01:35:21,875
Yes Sir!

716
01:35:33,083 --> 01:35:34,750
Uncle is worried...

717
01:35:34,875 --> 01:35:37,458
He should be… wait till I land

718
01:35:38,125 --> 01:35:42,000
You’re almost there… Prepare to land son

719
01:35:43,041 --> 01:35:43,958
Finally!

720
01:35:43,958 --> 01:35:45,041
Mr. Ranveer...

721
01:35:45,041 --> 01:35:47,250
...you have already been aligned with the runway

722
01:35:47,916 --> 01:35:52,083
The aircraft is equipped with an auto-landing feature.
You just need to feed some values to initiate it.  

723
01:35:52,208 --> 01:35:54,125
You know I love listening to you talk

724
01:35:56,416 --> 01:35:57,375
Ignore him

725
01:35:57,625 --> 01:35:59,083
Reduce speed to 80N. 

726
01:35:59,541 --> 01:36:00,416
Ok

727
01:36:06,333 --> 01:36:09,041
You should see a black lever next to the center keypad

728
01:36:09,041 --> 01:36:11,666
You need to set it to 25 degrees.

729
01:36:14,708 --> 01:36:18,416
Now lower the landing gear by flipping the landing gear lever.

730
01:36:50,875 --> 01:36:52,166
Shizzz!

731
01:36:53,083 --> 01:36:53,958
What?

732
01:36:56,041 --> 01:36:56,916
It's gone… 

733
01:36:57,375 --> 01:36:59,125
What?… Can you repeat?

734
01:36:59,541 --> 01:37:02,291
This aircraft does not have a landing gear anymore.

735
01:37:09,291 --> 01:37:13,875
Sir, you cannot land on the runway anymore, you will have to land on water. 

736
01:37:14,125 --> 01:37:17,041
That’s not happening… It’s a lot to learn in one day!

737
01:37:17,458 --> 01:37:20,291
Mr. Ranveer… you listen to me or you die!

738
01:37:20,625 --> 01:37:22,333
Ok ok listening… listening

739
01:37:22,625 --> 01:37:24,333
Woosha... Woosha...

740
01:37:35,541 --> 01:37:36,916
Tell me something… 

741
01:37:38,291 --> 01:37:40,208
...does this run on anything apart from fuel?

742
01:37:40,375 --> 01:37:41,166
What?

743
01:37:42,125 --> 01:37:43,208
I just ran out of fuel

744
01:37:46,833 --> 01:37:48,291
This man.. Bad News...

745
01:38:03,916 --> 01:38:06,291
Sir, he’s not going to make it. 

746
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:11,791
The safest area for a sea landing is a 100 Nautical miles from here to avoid any casualties.

747
01:38:12,333 --> 01:38:14,375
But he does not have the fuel to reach there.   

748
01:38:29,625 --> 01:38:30,708
Son...

749
01:38:30,791 --> 01:38:32,458
I know… We have a problem…

750
01:38:33,208 --> 01:38:34,875
Listen to me son… 

751
01:38:36,875 --> 01:38:38,541
...just Auto Eject

752
01:38:39,166 --> 01:38:41,250
We don't an option

753
01:38:42,666 --> 01:38:43,458
Dadda…

754
01:38:43,958 --> 01:38:45,666
I’m in no mood to die today

755
01:38:46,166 --> 01:38:48,583
Give it to me straight up… how much time do I have?

756
01:38:48,875 --> 01:38:49,750
But son...

757
01:38:50,416 --> 01:38:51,583
How much time we have?

758
01:38:52,666 --> 01:38:53,833
5 min

759
01:38:57,750 --> 01:38:58,916
5 minutes buddy…

760
01:38:59,375 --> 01:39:01,083
That’s a lot of time Dadda…

761
01:39:01,458 --> 01:39:04,833
Let's talk about something else. How’s your favorite girl doing?

762
01:39:05,041 --> 01:39:06,416
Still upset?

763
01:39:08,541 --> 01:39:09,458
Anyways…

764
01:39:09,833 --> 01:39:11,791
Who is our insurance agent?

765
01:39:12,166 --> 01:39:12,791
What?

766
01:39:13,333 --> 01:39:16,333
I mean I’m sure we’re insured… like accidental insurance or something…

767
01:39:17,250 --> 01:39:18,375
Ohh No No No…

768
01:39:18,666 --> 01:39:19,333
We don't?

769
01:39:20,166 --> 01:39:21,166
Yes we do but...

770
01:39:22,208 --> 01:39:25,500
You’re not going to do what I’m thinking!… 

771
01:39:25,500 --> 01:39:27,166
Don't even think about it!

772
01:39:27,708 --> 01:39:31,708
Wow! Aunt May is back!… You got me there...

773
01:39:33,916 --> 01:39:35,250
Hey hey.. listen… son.. 

774
01:39:37,166 --> 01:39:40,541
We can still think of another option

775
01:39:42,500 --> 01:39:43,083
Dadda listen...

776
01:39:43,083 --> 01:39:45,375
We have 4 minutes left...

777
01:39:47,958 --> 01:39:50,916
Let go of the emotion… It's time for some action.  

778
01:40:51,083 --> 01:40:53,000
Sir, we have to evacuate. Now! 

779
01:40:53,250 --> 01:40:53,833
Why?

780
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:58,333
A short circuit has caused a fire outbreak on the 3rd floor
So we have to leave... NOW!

781
01:40:58,333 --> 01:40:58,875
Ok

782
01:41:05,083 --> 01:41:08,708
You… take the investors down from here… I’ll get them out of the other exit. 

783
01:41:08,708 --> 01:41:09,750
Sir let’s go..

784
01:41:11,375 --> 01:41:12,208
Please follow me

785
01:42:07,833 --> 01:42:10,458
Everyone is going down. Why are we headed up?

786
01:42:10,458 --> 01:42:13,916
Sir, we’re going to airlift you from the terrace… that’s the fastest way to safety.

787
01:42:14,541 --> 01:42:15,750
Ok ok lets go!

788
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:27,208
Where is the helicopter?

789
01:42:27,541 --> 01:42:30,333
Sir, your helicopter should be here in 2 to 3 minutes

790
01:42:30,333 --> 01:42:32,208
Meanwhile,  I’ll go check on the rest of them. 

791
01:42:32,208 --> 01:42:33,166
Ok ok go.

792
01:42:34,125 --> 01:42:37,708
Hello… There seems to be a fire in the building…
I’ll have to call you back later

793
01:42:39,625 --> 01:42:40,500
Where is the helicopter?

794
01:42:40,500 --> 01:42:42,666
How the hell should I know?... You tell me!

795
01:42:43,416 --> 01:42:44,291
Hello…

796
01:42:45,083 --> 01:42:45,958
Mr. Khanna...

797
01:42:46,083 --> 01:42:46,833
Khanna: Yes…

798
01:42:47,208 --> 01:42:48,958
Someone wants to have a word...

799
01:42:50,375 --> 01:42:51,125
Yes...

800
01:42:51,958 --> 01:42:53,791
Whats Up Khanna uncle!!!

801
01:42:59,708 --> 01:43:00,958
Surprised?

802
01:43:00,958 --> 01:43:04,833
You were right… I am thick skinned…

803
01:43:04,833 --> 01:43:06,666
...and I ain’t dying so soon

804
01:43:09,125 --> 01:43:13,041
That was one hell of a plan. I must admit… 

805
01:43:13,208 --> 01:43:14,750
...you almost got it right.

806
01:43:15,291 --> 01:43:19,250
You spent all your life trying to outshine my father… 

807
01:43:19,750 --> 01:43:22,000
...you forgot one thing, I am his son.

808
01:43:30,375 --> 01:43:32,500
I’m appalled by your confidence

809
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:36,041
You’re still cocky knowing how this ends for you.

810
01:43:37,916 --> 01:43:42,125
In fact, you should thank me! 

811
01:43:42,583 --> 01:43:47,041
You almost destroyed our company this morning.
I’m the one trying to save it. 

812
01:43:47,625 --> 01:43:52,083
Adityaraj Aviation does not need to be saved… 

813
01:43:52,750 --> 01:43:54,625
Ranveer: All it needs is a makeover. 

814
01:43:56,041 --> 01:44:00,583
By the way, if you’re expecting fireworks in the sky…
you need to have the guts to look up. 

815
01:44:02,291 --> 01:44:03,291
Confused?

816
01:44:04,875 --> 01:44:06,291
So let the fun begin…

817
01:44:44,375 --> 01:44:45,666
Holy mother! 

818
01:44:45,666 --> 01:44:48,625
Hey Khanna … Khanna… 

819
01:44:49,291 --> 01:44:52,250
Hey Khan... Chuck it, I’m out. 

820
01:46:17,666 --> 01:46:19,708
Move! Move! Move!.. Quick!!!.... Hurry up!!! 

821
01:46:31,208 --> 01:46:34,833
Such is life Khanna Uncle… Such is life.

822
01:46:44,208 --> 01:46:45,875
This one’s for you Lily!

823
01:47:54,833 --> 01:47:55,875
The job’s done… 

824
01:47:57,458 --> 01:47:58,791
It’s time to come back.
