listen first

372
00:28:41,773 --> 00:28:43,087

374
00:28:44,652 --> 00:28:47,774

377
00:28:51,006 --> 00:28:53,459
Do not make a mistake and accept fault

378
00:28:53,459 --> 00:28:55,751

They fled from the cockpit

461
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,971
where and how, we are at the bottom of it all

462
00:37:21,971 --> 00:37:24,444

469
00:37:39,745 --> 00:37:41,949
The pilot has escaped from the plane

The pilot will be back

472
00:37:48,337 --> 00:37:51,827

The plane is being hijacked

484
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:35,171

00:40:13,241 --> 00:40:14,576
How can we get Cybrus?

Kill them all

501
00:40:31,275 --> 00:40:36,127
We must let all the passengers alive

502
00:40:36,127 --> 00:40:39,989
They are just one of the ways to call the pilot to return to air

503
00:40:45,547 --> 00:40:46,574
Sit here

504
00:40:46,892 --> 00:40:49,813

506
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:54,722
In the air there were approximately 300 passengers

507
00:40:54,722 --> 00:40:56,059
what will we do now ?

508
00:40:54,722 --> 00:40:59,034

514
00:41:21,426 --> 00:41:23,280
Aku, neeraja Bnuda

00:41:26,576 --> 00:41:30,193
The pilot we had not been in the cockpit for today

517
00:41:30,193 --> 00:41:32,903
We need another pilot

518
00:41:32,903 --> 00:41:35,659
If you are all quiet

519
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:38,733
and listen to the words they are then you all will feel safe

520
00:41:41,244 --> 00:41:44,600
They are not hostile to you

521
00:41:49,606 --> 00:41:53,195
I beg your hands down / No

522
00:41:53,195 --> 00:41:55,410
No, my hands were still above

523
00:41:55,410 --> 00:41:58,669

524
00:41:58,669 --> 00:41:59,908
I want to help you

525
00:41:59,908 --> 00:42:02,545

526
00:42:02,545 --> 00:42:07,099
they will believe and your job will be easier

527
00:42:02,545 --> 00:42:09,537
Listen

528
00:42:09,537 --> 00:42:11,845

529
00:42:11,845 --> 00:42:14,849
They let down their arms

530
00:42:14,849 --> 00:42:17,746
Please, drop all your hands

531
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,705
Sir, some of the passengers were from Pakistan

532
00:42:25,705 --> 00:42:28,176
Do I ask how many citizens of Pakistan?

533
00:42:28,176 --> 00:42:29,179
What do you want ?

534
00:42:29,179 --> 00:42:30,714
I have to get there

535
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:32,446
checking their passports

536
00:42:32,446 --> 00:42:34,377
if a citizen of Pakistan, I have to save him

537
00:42:34,377 --> 00:42:36,137
and to any others I should apologize

538
00:42:36,137 --> 00:42:37,438
Sorry, Sir

539
00:42:37,438 --> 00:42:39,680
Give it to me

540
00:42:44,374 --> 00:42:46,348
Prepare the car, I want to go there

545
00:43:15,429 --> 00:43:16,611
Do you hear my voice?

546
00:43:17,223 --> 00:43:19,305
I came to give relief to you

547
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:24,230
We should ask those same pilots

548
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:27,280
if not, we will kill the passengers ..

549
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:31,160
You can discuss these issues and we can talk

550
00:43:34,666 --> 00:43:36,422
Do you hear my voice / Close the window

551
00:43:37,647 --> 00:43:40,084

served to him, he does not think about his mother

1118
01:44:33,358 --> 01:44:40,419
how you care for your child so that he

1119
01:44:40,419 --> 01:44:43,040
brave as a soldier

1120
01:44:43,040 --> 01:44:45,014
not afraid of guns

1121
01:44:45,014 --> 01:44:48,256
I've never know

1122
01:44:48,256 --> 01:44:53,269
that my daughter was so brave

1123
01:44:53,269 --> 01:44:56,435
good daughter

1124
01:44:56,435 --> 01:45:00,306
but I always scolded him

1125
01:45:02,467 --> 01:45:04,625
do not do a lot of work

1126
01:45:04,625 --> 01:45:06,312
run with passion

1127
01:45:06,312 --> 01:45:08,431
always confident

1128
01:45:08,431 --> 01:45:12,793
when in a dangerous situation, think of honor and salvation

1129
01:45:12,793 --> 01:45:17,661
This is what we always teach our young daughter

1130
01:45:17,661 --> 01:45:23,795
Here, a man is said to be 'VEER "(brave)

1131
01:45:23,795 --> 01:45:27,465
Woman tying rakhi to men

1132
01:45:27,465 --> 01:45:31,747
Women's sister we never said please save us

1133
01:45:31,747 --> 01:45:35,604
I also take care of Neerja the same way

1134
01:45:36,027 --> 01:45:37,656
with laughter with him

1135
01:45:37,656 --> 01:45:41,529
with movie dialogue maupu n songs from the movie actor Rajesh Khanna

1136
01:45:41,529 --> 01:45:44,556
but I do not know my daughter

1137
01:45:44,556 --> 01:45:49,153
different from the others

1138
01:45:49,153 --> 01:45:52,592
the fate inscribed

1139
01:45:52,592 --> 01:45:55,005
he will be the light for everyone

1140
01:45:55,005 --> 01:45:57,892
but like this

1141
01:45:57,892 --> 01:46:02,646
died at a very young age at the age of 23 years

1142
01:46:02,646 --> 01:46:06,567
I can not say my pain

1143
01:46:09,494 --> 01:46:11,893
with the loss of your son

1144
01:46:11,893 --> 01:46:15,713
The greatest misery for a mother

1145
01:46:15,713 --> 01:46:19,778
I think, I want to die with him

1146
01:46:28,260 --> 01:46:30,755
Orang Mengtakn, neeraja Tidk Meninggl

1147

1148
01:46:34,904 --> 01:46:36,548
I give understanding to the heart

1149
01:46:36,548 --> 01:46:39,954
Laddoku have become immortal

1150
01:46:39,954 --> 01:46:42,537
but what I can do

1151
01:46:42,537 --> 01:46:44,891
I always remember

1152
01:46:44,891 --> 01:46:50,515
bhawa I could no longer see him

1153
01:46:56,864 --> 01:46:59,897
when he went into the final flight

1154
01:47:00,423 --> 01:47:05,310
I have not told you jgn do it and he had already left

1155
01:47:08,187 --> 01:47:14,042
If at that time I could have hugged him tightly

1156
01:47:43,115 --> 01:47:48,209
When Neerja received an award from the government for services services

1157
01:47:48,209 --> 01:47:53,064
they gave me the spirit

1158
01:47:53,064 --> 01:48:00,114
He said no one in this country ibupun

1159
01:48:00,114 --> 01:48:02,880
you should be proud

1160
01:48:07,807 --> 01:48:10,191
with sacrificing his life to save the lives of others

1161
01:48:10,191 --> 01:48:16,040
Neerja has been awarded the highest award of the State of India

1162
01:48:18,772 --> 01:48:22,595
I and Harishji do a good deed once

1163
01:48:22,595 --> 01:48:26,279
because Neerja was our daughter

1164
01:48:29,562 --> 01:48:33,490
the rest of his life did he teach me to live

1165
01:48:33,490 --> 01:48:36,518
there is a small child in the plane

1166
01:48:36,518 --> 01:48:41,798
told my mother

1167
01:48:41,798 --> 01:48:48,093
