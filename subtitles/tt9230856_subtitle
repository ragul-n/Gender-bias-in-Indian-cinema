" Snow Falling Time "

2
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:33,367
My name is Anand,

3
00:02:33,616 --> 00:02:34,436
Anand Krishna!

4
00:02:34,742 --> 00:02:36,383
This is my favourite place in Vizag…

5
00:02:37,211 --> 00:02:39,906
taking baby steps with mom,

6
00:02:42,023 --> 00:02:43,352
riding on dad’s shoulders.

7
00:02:43,428 --> 00:02:46,249
Dad used to take me till that big wave.

8
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:51,847
Mom got busy after my sister’s birth!

9
00:02:52,382 --> 00:02:59,890
Mom beat me for the very first time when I came to this beach without informing her.

10
00:03:00,074 --> 00:03:00,847
aaa...

11
00:03:01,027 --> 00:03:04,902
Dad still recollects that day when mom had cried because of me

12
00:03:04,972 --> 00:03:07,238
Partying with friends, fighting with them….

13
00:03:07,472 --> 00:03:10,426
If Mother Scolds me, I feel hurt and I sit here

14
00:03:11,049 --> 00:03:16,418
Never ending memories just like those waves!

15
00:03:32,095 --> 00:03:33,572
Hai..Hello..Namaste...

16
00:03:33,697 --> 00:03:34,970

Happyness

19
00:03:56,697 --> 00:04:00,618
My day started with my Dad’s Question Mark Face on why was I up so early

20
00:04:01,751 --> 00:04:04,392
Here comes my Columbus!

21
00:04:07,408 --> 00:04:08,330
Hai Brother

22
00:04:08,602 --> 00:04:09,141
Yes ?

23
00:04:09,266 --> 00:04:12,665
The road around the street is under repair,
you can take the adjacent lane to the main road.

24
00:04:12,815 --> 00:04:13,268
ohh...

25
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:14,438
Thanks Columbus

26
00:04:14,978 --> 00:04:18,541

Let’s start our program on a positive note…

32
00:04:38,742 --> 00:04:46,727
It’s me Krish… Call me on 0891226622…

33
00:04:47,437 --> 00:04:47,906
Krish!

34
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:54,623
This is not the first time I am warning you
not to discuss your personal matters on the show.

35
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:58,312
Do those make any sense even?

36
00:04:59,654 --> 00:05:00,951
You should go by the trend…

37
00:05:01,687 --> 00:05:06,029
there should be rhyming in all that you say.

38
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:09,704
Personally, I do not feel like having lunch without a punch(line)

39
00:05:10,109 --> 00:05:14,312
Rhyming and Timing is everything!

40
00:05:14,508 --> 00:05:21,032
‘Timing’… It’s time for the show! I need your script to give the show TRP’s a lift!

41
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:24,188
Hey hey hey… Script… Lift! You seem to have got it!

42
00:05:24,602 --> 00:05:25,407
Script Please

43
00:05:26,484 --> 00:05:27,680
I do not have it

44
00:05:28,531 --> 00:05:31,962
You can finish 10 scripts by the time a song is played.

45
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,540
This idiot does not even know the full form of TRP!

46
00:05:35,461 --> 00:05:40,807
You start the program .. I'll push the words with the pilot pen

47
00:05:40,885 --> 00:05:43,244

48
00:05:43,846 --> 00:05:45,744

00:05:45,859 --> 00:05:49,268
Today’s topic is ‘ Crazy Love ’

50
00:05:49,627 --> 00:05:50,033
Yes…

51
00:05:50,229 --> 00:05:55,565
Call me and share your crazy love incidents..
Let’s take the first call

52
00:05:56,979 --> 00:05:58,283
Hello..This is Ramu

53
00:05:58,315 --> 00:05:59,073
Yes Ramu

54
00:05:59,487 --> 00:06:03,893
Actually…I proposed to a girl yesterday morning and she accepted it instantly

55
00:06:04,244 --> 00:06:04,823
Very Good

56
00:06:05,182 --> 00:06:06,603
She broke up with me in the evening

57
00:06:06,854 --> 00:06:07,307
What???

58
00:06:07,776 --> 00:06:08,313
Why?

59
00:06:08,602 --> 00:06:10,713
That was my reaction as well

60
00:06:10,893 --> 00:06:15,963
I proposed to her in the morning,
we were in love during the afternoon...and broke up in the evening

61
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,510
What did you do?..Ramu

62
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:20,768
Loaned 4000 Rs!

63
00:06:21,141 --> 00:06:21,610
aaaa

64
00:06:22,016 --> 00:06:25,268
Oh my God! Looks like the guy who loaned me is coming…Talk to you later…Bye sir

65
00:06:25,323 --> 00:06:26,440
Ramu! Ramu! Raa

66
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:33,924
Started the day with a proposal and ended it with a break up

67
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:35,471
This for sure is ‘ Crazy Love ’

68
00:06:35,518 --> 00:06:37,213
Let’s check who our next caller is…

69
00:06:39,244 --> 00:06:39,776
Hello

70
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,994
Hai Tell us about your ‘ Crazy Love ’

71
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:45,166
Mine is not ‘ Crazy Love ’... But I am getting mad.

72
00:06:45,509 --> 00:06:46,111
Why?

73
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,369
My Name Is Surya

74
00:06:48,526 --> 00:06:50,323
I am in love with her for 3 years now

75
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:52,119
Very Good Surya..Did you tell her the same?

76
00:06:52,322 --> 00:06:55,698
I tried many times...but i could not.....

77
00:06:55,869 --> 00:06:56,478
why?

78
00:06:57,057 --> 00:06:58,174
She is my best friend

79
00:06:59,462 --> 00:07:01,080
That does not mean you should not propose her

80
00:07:01,237 --> 00:07:02,338
Not that I should not…

81
00:07:03,407 --> 00:07:04,876
just in case she does not like it

82
00:07:05,018 --> 00:07:08,088
You are worried that your friendship will be affected right?

83
00:07:08,768 --> 00:07:09,158
Yes!

84
00:07:09,635 --> 00:07:10,603
Just in case you don’t tell her,

85
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:16,597
she will never know,

86
00:07:18,597 --> 00:07:20,543
and what if she also has feelings for you?

87
00:07:21,168 --> 00:07:22,175
She would have said it

88
00:07:22,504 --> 00:07:26,621
If it is this difficult for you as a boy to express, imagine a girl’s plight!

89
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:30,472
This is quite common for those who are in love.

90
00:07:30,806 --> 00:07:32,876
Just go and express how much you like her,

91
00:07:33,269 --> 00:07:33,900
she will for sure agree

92
00:07:34,556 --> 00:07:35,707
Even if she does not,

93
00:07:36,285 --> 00:07:38,496
she will at least know that you are loving her.

94
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:40,449
whatever happens will only happen if you say

95
00:07:43,884 --> 00:07:44,892
Paddu is coming!

96
00:07:45,228 --> 00:07:47,496
Oh is it! Go then…all the best Surya

97
00:07:56,603 --> 00:07:59,472
I have been hiding this for 3 years,

98
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:02,379
I cannot do it any further,

99
00:08:07,746 --> 00:08:08,589
I love you Paddu

100
00:08:19,306 --> 00:08:22,449
you took so much time to say this!...i was waiting for this moment

101
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:23,175
Yesssss!

102
00:08:25,871 --> 00:08:28,402
Who else will like us more than our friends?

103
00:08:28,447 --> 00:08:32,457
So…lets hum a happy happy song in this happy mood!

104
00:09:02,506 --> 00:09:07,279
Right or Wrong…Doing it is happiness

105
00:09:07,319 --> 00:09:12,272
Sweet our Sour, Tasting it is happiness

106
00:09:12,564 --> 00:09:17,240
Like it or Not, experiencing is happiness

107
00:09:17,462 --> 00:09:22,228
If you look at it properly, everything is immense happiness..

108
00:09:22,626 --> 00:09:24,907
Happiness when love happens

109
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:27,243

Gather your naughtiness and play lovely games…Age is a Happiness

118
00:10:27,467 --> 00:10:32,428
Mom’s lullaby that words can’t weigh….is Happiness…

119
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:37,177
All the friendship with hand in hand…Happiness in us…

120
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:42,553
Childhood mischief….memories for a hundred years…more happiness…

121
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,138
Happiness is a colorful dream,

122
00:10:45,381 --> 00:10:47,443
imaginations are Happiness…

123
00:10:47,904 --> 00:10:50,099
Happiness is moonlight,

124
00:10:50,396 --> 00:10:52,334
Cold is Happiness…

125
00:10:52,881 --> 00:10:54,928
Happiness is the first wake up,

126
00:10:55,428 --> 00:10:57,490
light is happiness…

127
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,920
Happiness is every relation,

128
00:11:00,138 --> 00:11:03,084
life is happiness.

129
00:11:03,256 --> 00:11:05,769
Happiness…

130
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:17,256
Happiness…

131
00:11:33,404 --> 00:11:34,936
The concept of our program is….

132
00:11:36,334 --> 00:11:36,873
One Second…

133
00:11:40,451 --> 00:11:42,865
every program here should go as per my vision...

134
00:11:44,483 --> 00:11:45,068
what mister

135
00:11:45,553 --> 00:11:47,561
gave you the script…why are you still here?

136
00:11:49,545 --> 00:11:50,904
You need my blessings?

137
00:11:51,108 --> 00:11:54,576
Sir! You said you would shift my program to prime time.

138
00:11:58,068 --> 00:12:01,551
Prime time is not pop-corn to give you as soon as you ask for it.

139
00:12:02,522 --> 00:12:04,043
I need to get the permission from the Superiors

140
00:12:04,264 --> 00:12:05,576
Motivation in you

141
00:12:05,881 --> 00:12:10,332
the inspiration of bringing you up..must come in me

142
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:16,397
For now, give it an intermission and manage your mission first.

143
00:12:16,983 --> 00:12:18,412
Give me once chance sir!

144
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:19,647
Look

145
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:23,521
If you pester me like this for Prime Time,I will shift you to Crime Time!

146
00:12:23,904 --> 00:12:27,201
You will commit suicide after reporting all those rape and murder related stuff

147
00:12:27,389 --> 00:12:27,858
Go...

148
00:12:33,389 --> 00:12:35,490
You know about him and why do you still ask?

149
00:12:37,545 --> 00:12:41,772
If you stop trying because there is a problem, how will you fulfil your dreams?

150
00:12:45,897 --> 00:12:50,803
I am not sure what this squirrel faced Guy wrote in the script.

151
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,912
Seeing the girl

152
00:12:58,951 --> 00:13:02,678
Hai Listeners! Today’s topic on our show is ‘Love at first sight’

153
00:13:02,881 --> 00:13:04,631
Love born at first glance

154
00:13:04,772 --> 00:13:08,154
We heard in ' RAMAYANA ' that Sita loved Rama at her first sight.

155
00:13:08,561 --> 00:13:12,537
All the love stories from Tretayug to Kaliyug began with Love First Sight.

156
00:13:12,795 --> 00:13:13,287
So…

157
00:13:13,623 --> 00:13:18,225
let’s start our show with a poem on the magic of ‘Love at first sight’ by PD….

158
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,248
“At your first glance on the girl"

159
00:13:22,723 --> 00:13:25,529
“At your first glance on the girl"
Lightning should come from your eyes

160
00:13:25,576 --> 00:13:27,865
Thunders should strike her heart

161
00:13:29,107 --> 00:13:33,193
In that love cyclone… Girl Father & Mother should be washed away..

162
00:13:34,506 --> 00:13:36,584
Aaaa...Let’s take our first call....

163
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:40,248

166
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:53,608
Yes please

167
00:13:54,358 --> 00:13:56,496
“Dear PD…Dear PD…

168
00:13:56,834 --> 00:14:01,809
Your ears will be pierced if I start abusing you

169
00:14:02,051 --> 00:14:06,670
Your body will get stiches if I start bullying you

170
00:14:07,348 --> 00:14:14,662
Your photo will be garlanded if I come over to your office…Dirty idiot!

171
00:14:15,115 --> 00:14:16,356
You cannot write anything just because we are listening!

172
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:18,410
Thanks a lot for your affection!

173
00:14:19,965 --> 00:14:22,732
This guy’s words had meaning along with rhyming!

174
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:25,537
Let’s see who our next caller is!

175
00:14:27,599 --> 00:14:28,263
Hello…

176
00:14:30,599 --> 00:14:31,068
Hello…

177
00:14:31,826 --> 00:14:33,053
aaa....Hello…

178
00:14:34,295 --> 00:14:36,013
Why don’t you speak?

179
00:14:36,685 --> 00:14:38,621
Sorry Brother! I am just fixing my peg.

180
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:39,270
aah

181
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,201
Peg? In the Early Morning?

182
00:14:41,535 --> 00:14:45,045
Not the Whisky, Brandy, Vodka peg you know of…poison!

183
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:46,576
Po…Po… Poisonnn???

184
00:14:46,638 --> 00:14:48,131
I decided to end my life brother.

185
00:14:49,207 --> 00:14:54,217
The reason I called you is to let you know that you are the reason for it

186
00:14:54,904 --> 00:14:55,365
Meee???

187
00:14:55,684 --> 00:14:56,170
Yes you!!!

188
00:14:56,545 --> 00:14:57,748
how come i am the reason?

189
00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:05,277
I took the advice you gave a caller last week to propose his love and not hide it.

190
00:15:05,402 --> 00:15:08,826
I proposed my love to my Girl Friend and she rejected!

191
00:15:09,553 --> 00:15:10,615
I just want to die now!

192
00:15:13,014 --> 00:15:15,215
Do you have to end your life just because your Girl Friend rejected Sir?

193
00:15:15,607 --> 00:15:16,834
What else should i do?

194
00:15:17,777 --> 00:15:21,514
How will a person like you who gives free love
advice on air understand the pain in life?

195
00:15:23,107 --> 00:15:26,495
I might be the reason for you to propose her,

196
00:15:26,834 --> 00:15:30,534
but I do not agree that Love Failure is the reason for your suicide

197
00:15:30,706 --> 00:15:31,201
Why?

198
00:15:32,428 --> 00:15:33,862
There is nothing called Love Failure!

199
00:15:34,084 --> 00:15:34,576
aaa

200
00:15:35,342 --> 00:15:36,428
Nothing called Love Failure?

201
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:37,724
Absolutely

202
00:15:38,131 --> 00:15:39,662
How old are you brother?

203
00:15:40,459 --> 00:15:41,185
For?

204
00:15:41,568 --> 00:15:42,842
You speak like a kid

205
00:15:43,178 --> 00:15:44,099
What do you mean?

206
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:46,081
Had you ever been in love, you will never speak like this

207
00:15:46,209 --> 00:15:48,089
So, you mean that I was never in love?

208
00:15:48,576 --> 00:15:49,951
So, you say this when you are in love then?

209
00:15:50,373 --> 00:15:51,014
Yes

210
00:15:53,045 --> 00:15:55,060
Is it? Well then…tell us about your love story and lover

211
00:15:55,592 --> 00:15:58,527
If you prove that there is no Love Failure I will Drop

212
00:15:59,527 --> 00:16:01,269
This program is for you people to tell…not me

213
00:16:01,537 --> 00:16:06,842
Tell us If you cannot, accept that what you had just said is wrong
 and l will go ahead with my suicide.

214
00:16:11,717 --> 00:16:15,386
Just in case you are thinking that you are in a fix

215
00:16:15,527 --> 00:16:18,706
you should think twice before you say anything to a clever guy like me

216
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:20,151
No…

217
00:16:22,318 --> 00:16:23,568
I am just thinking from where I need to start

218
00:16:24,107 --> 00:16:28,474
The topic that day was ‘Love at First Sight’, so you can start from there

219
00:16:29,685 --> 00:16:32,341
I was walking along on the beach side that day…

220
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:35,529
Running waves in the moonlight,

221
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:41,380
the sea appeared more excited than usual.

222
00:16:42,693 --> 00:16:47,232
After I walked for a while, I could understand the reason why!

223
00:16:48,334 --> 00:16:51,264
She looked like a Peacock dancing on the Sea shore

224
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,334
Her face like smile

225
00:16:57,373 --> 00:16:59,615
the silence between her lips.

226
00:17:00,779 --> 00:17:03,506
The foam from the waves gently touched her feet.

227
00:17:04,654 --> 00:17:08,927
Unknown anguish in her constant gaze towards the moon…

228
00:17:09,724 --> 00:17:10,435
And then?

229
00:17:10,661 --> 00:17:17,224
To know what happened then, tune into our show next week
 on Radio City 91.1. Just another week of wait.

230
00:17:17,451 --> 00:17:18,576
Till next week?

231
00:17:19,474 --> 00:17:21,404
Hello…. Hello brother…

232
00:17:21,858 --> 00:17:24,897
How many times should I remind you not to tell personal stories?

233
00:17:26,084 --> 00:17:26,451
Sir!

234
00:17:26,944 --> 00:17:28,139
It was not my personal story

235
00:17:28,983 --> 00:17:29,530
it was fictitious!

236
00:17:30,084 --> 00:17:30,802
Fictitious???

237
00:17:31,225 --> 00:17:34,209
Yes Sir! Instantly cooked up story only to divert the caller from his suicide plot

238
00:17:34,849 --> 00:17:36,716
You counted on that unwise caller’s words?

239
00:17:37,045 --> 00:17:40,108
It is those people like him who commit suicide for petty reasons

240
00:17:41,092 --> 00:17:42,194
What if he calls again?

241
00:17:42,787 --> 00:17:43,615
Good for us

242
00:17:44,061 --> 00:17:45,858
We will know at least that he did not commit suicide

243
00:17:46,209 --> 00:17:50,865
What if he asks what had happened next in Your fictitious Story

244
00:17:51,052 --> 00:17:53,647
I can figure out something sir…don’t worry!

245
00:17:53,967 --> 00:17:56,334
What is the concept of the show and what is that you are doing?

246
00:17:57,677 --> 00:18:02,935
Live programs do not run on concepts...
they run on improvisations! You have to improvise based on the situation

247
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:10,021
Hello Radio City 91.1

248
00:18:10,529 --> 00:18:12,873
What had happened next? Did Krish meet the girl?

249
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,576
Which girl?

250
00:18:13,771 --> 00:18:15,099
The girl he saw on the beach

251
00:18:15,318 --> 00:18:16,389
Girl on the beach?

252
00:18:16,693 --> 00:18:18,037
The girl from Krish’s love story

253
00:18:18,216 --> 00:18:23,388
where is that girl to meet!..where?..where do you come from...Yoooo...cut the call

254
00:18:44,553 --> 00:18:45,724
Hey Baby!

255
00:18:48,967 --> 00:18:55,006
Here is a rose with a dash of love dose…
only if you could give me a smiling pose…

256
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:56,842
I have something for you on my feet! Do you need love?

257
00:18:57,474 --> 00:19:02,818
Your Something is Yours...My Flower is Mine...My Lover is Somewhere...Aaaahhh..

258
00:19:06,256 --> 00:19:06,787
Seshu

259
00:19:07,263 --> 00:19:08,099
Ware is sinkaa..

260
00:19:12,772 --> 00:19:13,834
Sinka! Why do you look so tensed?

261
00:19:13,866 --> 00:19:14,959
Kattappa is in the campus

262
00:19:15,194 --> 00:19:16,076
Kattappa????

263
00:19:16,771 --> 00:19:17,991
What are you saying?

264
00:19:24,693 --> 00:19:25,655
Fresh Chicken,

265
00:19:27,123 --> 00:19:28,442
Singareni Kaatam Raju

266
00:19:28,725 --> 00:19:30,100
Singarakonda Sivagami

267
00:19:31,873 --> 00:19:34,295
How did you dare lay your hand on Kaatam Raju?

268
00:19:34,326 --> 00:19:35,248
Kadhiri Kattappa

269
00:19:35,678 --> 00:19:36,991
Jai Mahishmathi

270
00:19:42,943 --> 00:19:44,694
Why don’t you give me an idea instead of smiling?

271
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:50,483
You need to praise their beauty for girls to fall for you

272
00:19:52,061 --> 00:19:54,670
Sinka will sincerely follow your advice

273
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:56,100
Let’s see!

274
00:19:56,483 --> 00:19:58,100
Hey Anand, are you up for the beach this evening?

275
00:20:12,506 --> 00:20:16,288
Baby is alone for a while now, let me do a trial

276
00:20:19,029 --> 00:20:20,396
Enough footage for Facebook

277
00:20:21,895 --> 00:20:22,880
You are beautiful

278
00:20:25,513 --> 00:20:26,725
In fact, you are very beautiful!

279
00:20:26,888 --> 00:20:27,693
One more time

280
00:20:28,389 --> 00:20:29,842
You are very beautiful

281
00:20:29,889 --> 00:20:30,748
Say it loud

282
00:20:30,773 --> 00:20:31,654
You are very....

283
00:20:31,786 --> 00:20:32,444
Say it now

284
00:20:33,224 --> 00:20:34,631
You look very angry

285
00:20:40,678 --> 00:20:41,319
Hello mom

286
00:20:41,427 --> 00:20:43,100
Why dint you come home?

287
00:20:43,498 --> 00:20:44,599
I am at the beach

288
00:20:45,482 --> 00:20:46,959
Ok. Come back early

289
00:20:47,443 --> 00:20:48,685
Ok mom, I will

290
00:20:48,851 --> 00:20:49,303
Bye Darling

291
00:20:49,365 --> 00:20:49,779
Bye

292
00:20:58,459 --> 00:21:01,436
She looked like a Peacock dancing on the Sea shore

293
00:21:04,342 --> 00:21:05,896
Her face like smile

294
00:21:08,365 --> 00:21:10,819
the silence between her lips.

295
00:21:13,092 --> 00:21:16,014
The foam from the waves gently touched her feet.

296
00:21:17,912 --> 00:21:23,200
Unknown anguish in her constant gaze towards the moon…

297
00:21:34,475 --> 00:21:34,881
He..

298
00:21:52,834 --> 00:21:54,600
Did you not go to sleep?

299
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,592
Where have you been? You mobile is switched off as well

300
00:21:59,615 --> 00:22:02,146
I did not check that

301
00:22:02,974 --> 00:22:04,733
It’s ok. Come have dinner

302
00:22:05,686 --> 00:22:06,826
I don’t feel hungry mom

303
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,115
What happened darling?

304
00:22:23,936 --> 00:22:25,795
Senseless Fellows, Senseless Fellows!

305
00:22:25,936 --> 00:22:27,147
Sir Script

306
00:22:28,208 --> 00:22:30,748
I have decided not to write any scripts

307
00:22:31,216 --> 00:22:31,795
Why?

308
00:22:32,264 --> 00:22:34,748
I am being abused in live for my creative poems.

309
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:39,701
People like your fake stories and they call me up to know what happened next

310
00:22:42,006 --> 00:22:42,811
Hello

311
00:22:43,193 --> 00:22:44,451
Is that Krish?

312
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:45,584
I am his boss

313
00:22:45,998 --> 00:22:47,686
What sir? Krish still did not start the program

314
00:22:47,896 --> 00:22:51,545
He will. Can’t you wait till he does?

315
00:22:54,506 --> 00:22:55,920
That is why I have decided

316
00:22:56,076 --> 00:22:58,701
not to give Ph.D. lectures to a 10th grade students

317
00:22:59,216 --> 00:23:02,763
For those who like fake stories, my creativity will be a burden

318
00:23:03,014 --> 00:23:05,404
Go..Continue Your Fake Story

319
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:06,944
Sirrr fake story

320
00:23:06,969 --> 00:23:07,647
I understand

321
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:12,083
Running the show without my guidance will be a challenge, but you have to.

322
00:23:12,943 --> 00:23:18,475
My only concern is that my creativity is being killed

323
00:23:19,787 --> 00:23:20,506
I will continue sir

324
00:23:20,531 --> 00:23:21,154
aa..aaa

325
00:23:21,771 --> 00:23:24,303
Krish! What happened next? Did you meet her?

326
00:24:03,569 --> 00:24:04,327
It happened

327
00:24:04,616 --> 00:24:09,240
How did you meet a girl whom
you could not find on searching for hours that night?

328
00:24:09,584 --> 00:24:13,834
Even if you had missed her,
how long it would have taken you to find her in Vizag?

329
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:15,452
I had the same thought,

330
00:24:16,014 --> 00:24:16,834
but the next day

331
00:24:16,923 --> 00:24:17,657
Did you see her?

332
00:24:17,798 --> 00:24:19,868
Women’s Colleges, Engineering Colleges,

333
00:24:19,893 --> 00:24:21,353
Cinema Halls, Shopping Malls,

334
00:24:21,378 --> 00:24:22,751
Kailasagiri to Simhachalam,

335
00:24:22,923 --> 00:24:26,251
Gangavaram, Yarada, Ramakrishna, Rushikonda, Bheemili Beach.

336
00:24:26,321 --> 00:24:28,212
From Andhra University to Araku Valley,

337
00:24:28,915 --> 00:24:29,798
apart from these,

338
00:24:29,962 --> 00:24:30,915
Jagadamba Junction

339
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:31,993

Seethammadhara….

346
00:24:38,056 --> 00:24:40,267
I covered every nook and corner of the city for her

347
00:24:40,326 --> 00:24:40,599
Ohh!

348
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:46,735
Girls are all the same brother. They appear, they make you run,
they make you fall in love and then they make you drink alcohol

349
00:24:47,638 --> 00:24:48,365
Is it?

350
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:52,220
Brother! Do not let yourself down that you could not see her again.
 If not her, someone else

351
00:24:52,337 --> 00:24:53,798
Where is the girl to see?

352
00:24:54,017 --> 00:24:55,431
Did I say I did not see her again?

353
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:56,149
aaahhh.....

354
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:57,712
That is what I thought you said till now?

355
00:24:57,892 --> 00:25:00,563
You did not let me finish!

356
00:25:00,806 --> 00:25:01,751
Ohh! Sorry brother

357
00:25:02,415 --> 00:25:03,337
What happened next?

358
00:26:55,704 --> 00:26:56,321

00:26:57,384 --> 00:26:58,040

00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:08,935
Java was designed by James Gosling.

364
00:27:09,423 --> 00:27:12,782
Do you know which company helped him?

365
00:27:13,407 --> 00:27:14,196
Microsoft!

366
00:27:14,688 --> 00:27:15,071
No!

367
00:27:15,415 --> 00:27:16,095
Oracle sir

368
00:27:16,634 --> 00:27:17,142
Good guess,

369
00:27:17,423 --> 00:27:17,923
but no.

370
00:27:18,322 --> 00:27:19,361
Oracle Developed it

371
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:21,782
any one ?

372
00:27:26,063 --> 00:27:27,188
Sun Microsystems.

373
00:27:30,833 --> 00:27:31,544
One more question.

374
00:27:32,009 --> 00:27:36,337
What was the language first used to develop the ‘WhatsApp’ we are using?

375
00:27:36,774 --> 00:27:37,360
Java

376
00:27:37,876 --> 00:27:38,321
No

377
00:27:38,743 --> 00:27:39,349
Oracle Sir

378
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:42,063
Don’t know you another name than Oracle?

379
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:43,423
Any guesses?

380
00:27:52,954 --> 00:27:55,806
Did you get your seat in third counselling? You have joined pretty late.

381
00:27:55,831 --> 00:27:56,743
No for sure!

382
00:27:56,813 --> 00:28:02,032
She was noting down every question and answer in the class
In my opinion, you are a studious girl

383
00:28:03,071 --> 00:28:03,790
He is Aa..

384
00:28:03,815 --> 00:28:04,532
Anand

385
00:28:04,595 --> 00:28:05,298
Her Name

386
00:28:05,323 --> 00:28:05,813
I don’t know

387
00:28:05,838 --> 00:28:06,313
Geeta

388
00:28:07,532 --> 00:28:13,321
Instead of writing the answer in the notebook,
you should have said it aloud in the class

389
00:28:14,321 --> 00:28:15,587
You have a smile for everything.

390
00:28:15,798 --> 00:28:16,563
Canteen?

391
00:28:17,079 --> 00:28:18,610
No. Library!

392
00:28:18,712 --> 00:28:22,001
So…the girl you were searching for ended up in your class

393
00:28:22,548 --> 00:28:23,079
Next

394
00:28:23,704 --> 00:28:26,075
What do you think happened next?

395
00:28:26,353 --> 00:28:27,556
How would I know brother?

396
00:28:27,595 --> 00:28:28,423
Do you want to?

397
00:28:28,556 --> 00:28:29,735
Don’t you want to tell us?

398
00:28:30,068 --> 00:28:36,044
I do! I will get to know about her and tell you in our next show!

399
00:29:04,712 --> 00:29:07,040
When the snow falls,

400
00:29:07,212 --> 00:29:09,462
all the beauty like you…

401
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:11,962
you create hope on you..

402
00:29:12,095 --> 00:29:14,532
the noise does not stop

403
00:29:14,557 --> 00:29:16,821
Is one glimpse enough?

404
00:29:16,978 --> 00:29:19,306
To make me lost…

405
00:29:19,438 --> 00:29:21,728
The foot leaving the ground…

406
00:29:21,884 --> 00:29:24,470
to fly in the air…

407
00:29:24,495 --> 00:29:29,353
Oh dear, your walk…like the Niagara falls

408
00:29:29,407 --> 00:29:34,204
Your words sounding…like a Telugu tune to the ears

409
00:29:34,229 --> 00:29:39,057
Do not hide your heart, out of obligation….Oh partner…

410
00:29:39,149 --> 00:29:43,829
Come soon…to meet my dream concealed by my eyes

411
00:30:25,431 --> 00:30:27,431
It is like watching the same movie in a loop.

412
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:29,642
One week of my wait is not worth it.

413
00:30:29,946 --> 00:30:31,454
I too feel the same brother.

414
00:30:31,845 --> 00:30:33,540
This is not the type of girl I was looking for.

415
00:30:33,735 --> 00:30:35,173
What were you looking for in a girl then?

416
00:30:40,407 --> 00:30:42,782
At that moment we are to meet,

417
00:30:42,985 --> 00:30:45,313
why do you keep looking for me

418
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:50,232
That music of silence even before I say a Hi

419
00:30:50,407 --> 00:30:55,063
The time I let my heart out, all the naughtiness like me

420
00:30:55,251 --> 00:31:00,228
Is following you enough? Do we become one?

421
00:31:00,313 --> 00:31:05,063
Is being with you to share your dreams enough…

422
00:31:05,165 --> 00:31:09,743
Adding life to a tireless wish…

423
00:31:10,055 --> 00:31:14,899
For you to know that I am a walking shadow…not to go back…

424
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:19,423
For me to gift my breath to you!

425
00:31:22,306 --> 00:31:24,825
I like your thoughts, but do you find such traits in a girl?

426
00:31:25,579 --> 00:31:26,454
Not sure,

427
00:31:27,407 --> 00:31:28,923
but life will be good if we can find

428
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:29,821
Is it?

429
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:31,618
How exactly?

430
00:31:32,625 --> 00:31:36,938
Hey…Hey…What happened?

431
00:31:37,423 --> 00:31:41,860
This feels good…

432
00:31:42,446 --> 00:31:46,719
Heart wished for a bit

433
00:31:47,297 --> 00:31:51,641
more of something…

434
00:31:51,743 --> 00:32:01,329
My world has changed, the time has changed…
Changed like this with you…

435
00:32:01,452 --> 00:32:10,765
Happiness… your beauty…should be mine…
Like those lines in the palm….

436
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:23,624
You had a nice dream…

437
00:32:24,117 --> 00:32:24,632
after that?

438
00:32:29,304 --> 00:32:29,757
Geeta…

439
00:32:31,038 --> 00:32:33,765
we all are planning a trip to Araku tomorrow.
I hope you are coming as well.

440
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:35,484
No Anand.

441
00:32:36,171 --> 00:32:37,843
Do you have any plans with your parents?

442
00:32:38,663 --> 00:32:39,460
Nope. Will stay home.

443
00:32:39,703 --> 00:32:40,531
You can come with us then.

444
00:32:41,593 --> 00:32:42,406
Sorry Anand.

445
00:32:42,788 --> 00:32:43,507
I don’t like it.

446
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:49,749
Ok. You should not anything you don’t like. Bye!

447
00:32:51,343 --> 00:32:54,015
Dreams and Reality are far apart.

448
00:32:54,867 --> 00:32:56,624
I wish guys understand this.

449
00:32:57,179 --> 00:32:58,148
Next?

450
00:33:00,374 --> 00:33:01,179
Who are you?

451
00:33:01,523 --> 00:33:02,547
We are...

452
00:33:02,937 --> 00:33:03,820
We are thieves

453
00:33:04,008 --> 00:33:04,883
aaa

454
00:33:05,515 --> 00:33:11,297
We have information that you have lot chocolates and ice creams in store at your home.
We just came to steal them.

455
00:33:11,328 --> 00:33:13,039
Not lot of them, only two of them.

456
00:33:13,429 --> 00:33:14,023
No

457
00:33:15,046 --> 00:33:18,008
I don’t trust you. Guys! Let’s go and search.

458
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:19,289
We really don’t have any of those

459
00:33:19,314 --> 00:33:20,336
Who is that honey?

460
00:33:20,447 --> 00:33:21,853
Thieves apparently!.....Hai Aunty

461
00:33:25,345 --> 00:33:26,908
Geeta did not tell you about us right?

462
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:28,627
Where is Geeta?

463
00:33:29,634 --> 00:33:30,447
In the kitchen

464
00:33:30,712 --> 00:33:33,181
I will ask her why.

465
00:33:35,611 --> 00:33:37,243
Did you add cashew to upma?

466
00:33:39,275 --> 00:33:40,048
Good Morning.

467
00:33:41,595 --> 00:33:43,111
How did you all come uninformed?

468
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,525
Just to give you a surprise.

469
00:33:47,791 --> 00:33:50,025
So early in the morning?

470
00:33:50,548 --> 00:33:52,361
I did not say anything yet.

471
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:56,608
Your face says, if not you. Can you smile a bit?

472
00:33:59,064 --> 00:34:00,564
Are you all from the same class?

473
00:34:00,589 --> 00:34:02,002
Yes aunty. We all are from the same group and class

474
00:34:02,244 --> 00:34:04,007
I will just be back. Come with me.

475
00:34:07,517 --> 00:34:08,252
Very Nice

476
00:34:09,235 --> 00:34:10,375
Did you all not go to Araku?

477
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:16,304
It is raining in Araku. One of my friends called me and informed.

478
00:34:16,999 --> 00:34:19,725
Upma will get over...

479
00:34:19,874 --> 00:34:22,874
Sinka is already in the kitchen.

480
00:34:25,835 --> 00:34:27,132
Did you leave anything for us?

481
00:34:27,577 --> 00:34:29,093
There was hardly any upma.

482
00:34:29,118 --> 00:34:30,249
Hardly any upma?

483
00:34:33,132 --> 00:34:35,812
Geeta…I have a lot of video games in my mobile.

484
00:34:36,296 --> 00:34:37,171
Games…

485
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:01,734
Have it Sruthi.

486
00:35:01,984 --> 00:35:02,827
Thank you, Aunty.

487
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:04,421
Have it son.

488
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:07,335
Aunty…you should make a post in FB if you want to give him anything.

489
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:10,241
FB? What?

490
00:35:11,187 --> 00:35:12,038
Don’t you know FB?

491
00:35:13,187 --> 00:35:14,640
This needs to be posted urgently in FB

492
00:35:14,796 --> 00:35:16,984
Friends She is the second person in Vizag who does not know FB.

493
00:35:17,249 --> 00:35:18,851
Who is the first one?

494
00:35:19,147 --> 00:35:19,898
My mom.

495
00:35:30,452 --> 00:35:31,913
Dad is home.

496
00:35:36,303 --> 00:35:36,920
Hai Uncle.

497
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:38,295
Hai.

498
00:35:39,514 --> 00:35:41,014
They are Geeta’s classmates.

499
00:35:41,663 --> 00:35:47,249
Aunty, let us discuss what we need to prepare for lunch over a cup of Boost.

500
00:36:23,942 --> 00:36:25,833
Surprise!

501
00:36:26,091 --> 00:36:28,622
Happy Birthday!

502
00:36:29,325 --> 00:36:32,059
You must be wondering…why all this?

503
00:36:33,881 --> 00:36:37,780
Small gestures like this can get us big treats.

504
00:36:37,991 --> 00:36:39,084
Treat?

505
00:36:39,264 --> 00:36:42,725
Yes Treat! Our group is expecting a solid party from you.

506
00:36:43,725 --> 00:36:46,163
Don’t you all want a party?

507
00:36:46,342 --> 00:36:48,202
Yes We Want

508
00:36:49,491 --> 00:36:59,366
Happy Birthday Geeta… Happy Birthday to you Geeta

509
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:02,686
Happy Birthday to you

510
00:37:09,514 --> 00:37:10,795
Happy Birthday

511
00:37:10,827 --> 00:37:11,420
Thank You

512
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:12,952
Happy Birthday

513
00:37:15,467 --> 00:37:17,983
Will you have all of it? Spare me some

514
00:37:48,514 --> 00:37:52,975
Anand…our balloon concept got 5000 likes in 5 minutes.

515
00:37:53,803 --> 00:37:56,764
Enough of your FB now! Geeta where is the party?

516
00:37:56,936 --> 00:37:57,819
Come over to my place.

517
00:37:57,999 --> 00:37:59,061
Nooo

518
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:03,624
That is not where we are expecting you to treat us

519
00:38:03,756 --> 00:38:04,569
Then?

520
00:38:05,545 --> 00:38:06,194
There!

521
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:08,303
Cheers!

522
00:38:09,334 --> 00:38:09,983
Don’t we have anything?

523
00:38:10,022 --> 00:38:10,318
aahh...

524
00:38:12,475 --> 00:38:13,835
give the sprite,we will drink

525
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:41,952
The Brightness of the sky comes together to form this Beauty...Standing on the seashore

526
00:38:42,686 --> 00:38:45,272
Look at the waves..Racing to touch you

527
00:38:45,999 --> 00:38:53,583
the moon says....how much ever you try...you can reach only her feet

528
00:38:54,897 --> 00:38:58,077
The tired waves rise so hopefully...

529
00:38:58,835 --> 00:39:03,147
Form into Breeze Showers...Gently touching you and feel happy, they won

530
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:08,030
Does he have this perspective on the side ... two eyes are looking surprisingly!

531
00:39:10,116 --> 00:39:12,569
now smiling gently

532
00:39:16,421 --> 00:39:18,124
Are you the lone child at home?

533
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:20,312
No Geeta. I have a sister.

534
00:39:24,569 --> 00:39:29,663
Tell me Shruthi Don’t I have enough wealth and status?

535
00:39:29,765 --> 00:39:31,085
Who said that?

536
00:39:31,194 --> 00:39:32,241
You have more of everything.

537
00:39:35,265 --> 00:39:39,562
Everyone has a day… even I do

538
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,350
Isn’t an animal missing from the statement?

539
00:39:42,155 --> 00:39:45,577
You moron I can kick you to the other end of the sea.

540
00:39:46,646 --> 00:39:48,007
Sruthi can you hear my inner voice?

541
00:39:54,757 --> 00:39:57,905
Reach home safe and call me as soon as you do.

542
00:39:58,507 --> 00:39:59,499
Bye

543
00:39:59,694 --> 00:40:00,405
Bye

544
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:05,780
What?

545
00:40:05,882 --> 00:40:06,976
I need some more Drink

546
00:40:08,265 --> 00:40:09,890
Go home, it’s already late.

547
00:40:10,687 --> 00:40:11,515
Are you coming or not?

548
00:40:17,833 --> 00:40:19,741
You did not call me as soon as you reached. Did you?

549
00:40:34,245 --> 00:40:35,776
Day dream

550
00:40:36,362 --> 00:40:39,096
Why will Geeta come here so early in the morning.

551
00:40:54,501 --> 00:40:57,470
Geeta…this is not a dream.... O my god

552
00:41:02,283 --> 00:41:04,142
Take whatever you want

553
00:41:05,189 --> 00:41:07,548
I will have one first

554
00:41:08,798 --> 00:41:09,861
Have you started it again?

555
00:41:10,095 --> 00:41:12,251
I warned you not to have ice cream for a week

556
00:41:13,751 --> 00:41:15,587
Let her have one.

557
00:41:15,736 --> 00:41:19,528
She recovered from cold only today.

558
00:41:20,771 --> 00:41:22,747
What are you waiting for? Put it back in the fridge.

559
00:41:24,533 --> 00:41:25,040
oooh...

560
00:41:31,626 --> 00:41:32,814
Guess she is upset.

561
00:41:33,048 --> 00:41:35,283
That hardly lasts a couple of minutes.

562
00:41:38,978 --> 00:41:40,114
Hey…did Geeta also come?

563
00:41:40,224 --> 00:41:41,286
Hai Geeta. Hai Aunty.

564
00:41:41,325 --> 00:41:42,614
Happy Anniversary Aunty

565
00:41:42,845 --> 00:41:43,556
Thank you

566
00:41:45,947 --> 00:41:49,626
Sharat…she is Geeta, Anand’s classmate.

567
00:41:50,337 --> 00:41:51,626
Happy Anniversary Uncle.

568
00:41:51,767 --> 00:41:52,384
Thank you.

569
00:41:55,603 --> 00:41:56,181
Hey.

570
00:41:56,658 --> 00:41:57,720
When did you come?

571
00:42:03,587 --> 00:42:05,587
What happened to you sweetheart

572
00:42:05,923 --> 00:42:07,689
Geeta Akka did not let me have Ice Cream

573
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,283
Geetha Look there!

574
00:42:11,619 --> 00:42:14,064
They are up to come mischief!

575
00:42:18,525 --> 00:42:18,970
ohhh...

576
00:42:24,244 --> 00:42:26,712
Hai Geeta. Hey Sruthi! When did you all come?

577
00:42:26,814 --> 00:42:28,431
Anand, come here.

578
00:42:28,462 --> 00:42:29,322
One second.

579
00:42:32,595 --> 00:42:34,017
How may Ice Creams did you have?

580
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:37,939
Ice Creams aa...Not even one

581
00:42:38,478 --> 00:42:40,439
You asked me not to.

582
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:44,806
Wipe your mouth properly sweetheart!

583
00:42:48,970 --> 00:42:50,978
Sweetheart, Mom is calling you for something.

584
00:42:55,215 --> 00:42:56,400
Hello Sinka… can you hear me?

585
00:43:03,056 --> 00:43:07,994
If we are destined to get what we had desired for,
things fall in place.

586
00:43:08,512 --> 00:43:14,634
Geeta calling me to check if I had reached safe,

587
00:43:14,884 --> 00:43:16,486
Mom picking the call instead, inviting Geeta

588
00:43:16,767 --> 00:43:18,642
and liking her as well.

589
00:43:19,017 --> 00:43:22,126
Looks like

590
00:43:22,517 --> 00:43:26,314
The winds of destiny are towards us!

591
00:43:31,767 --> 00:43:32,814
Why do you need all this?

592
00:43:35,533 --> 00:43:40,314
Whatever you say or ask, Geeta only has a smile
to answer

593
00:43:41,908 --> 00:43:43,923
Occasionally comes a little bit of anger

594
00:44:06,134 --> 00:44:12,845
I recollected a joke my friend in the US shared me on WhatsApp. Sorry…Sorry

595
00:44:14,205 --> 00:44:17,353
Can we also hear the joke?

596
00:44:17,915 --> 00:44:21,017
It is a very popular joke in the USA

597
00:44:21,455 --> 00:44:23,525
Don’t keep us waiting till the next show for the joke.

598
00:44:24,301 --> 00:44:26,017
Why did the Chicken cross the road?

599
00:44:26,376 --> 00:44:29,080
Why did the chicken cross the road? Is that a joke?

600
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:32,540
Yes it depends on the answer we think of

601
00:44:33,254 --> 00:44:37,431
Coming up is a Megastar remake from Magadheera

602
00:44:39,681 --> 00:44:41,775
Why did the chicken cross the road?

603
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:46,782
Rangi…Rangi…

604
00:44:47,110 --> 00:44:48,978
Why did the chicken cross the road?

605
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:51,814
I am not sure if she understood the question.

606
00:44:52,728 --> 00:44:54,142
Why did the chicken cross the road I say???

607
00:44:54,478 --> 00:44:57,228
Did you start drinking already? You bloody moron!

608
00:44:57,290 --> 00:45:00,611
I never knew a joke would evoke such an emotion

609
00:45:02,427 --> 00:45:03,231
aaaaaa....

610
00:45:03,458 --> 00:45:05,767
if I asked... why the chicken lays egg?

611
00:45:10,489 --> 00:45:14,970
Why don’t you (Anand) tell me the answer bro?

612
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:16,275
To get to the other side

613
00:45:16,989 --> 00:45:18,736
To get to the other side?

614
00:45:18,845 --> 00:45:19,212
Yes

615
00:45:19,978 --> 00:45:21,861
Chicken crossed the road to get to the other side?

616
00:45:22,205 --> 00:45:26,317
Thank God, I did not let my inner thoughts out…

617
00:45:36,213 --> 00:45:36,697
Geetha

618
00:45:37,369 --> 00:45:38,377
Daily over there

619
00:45:39,025 --> 00:45:39,971
you can sit here also

620
00:45:43,571 --> 00:45:46,439
the people who sat there might have become software engineers

621
00:45:46,705 --> 00:45:49,431
the people who sat here became Great Celebrities

622
00:45:50,259 --> 00:45:50,767
hey..what do you say?

623
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:51,447
Yes..Yes

624
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:05,696
Hai Geeta.

625
00:46:06,524 --> 00:46:09,266
Where are you all going?

626
00:46:09,713 --> 00:46:11,298
Same question here, where are you going?

627
00:46:11,517 --> 00:46:12,298
College

628
00:46:14,252 --> 00:46:16,798
Are there special classes only for you alone?

629
00:46:18,345 --> 00:46:21,353
There is a Student’s union strike in the University.

630
00:46:21,658 --> 00:46:23,048
Get ready, we will go out.

631
00:46:26,071 --> 00:46:31,754
Go have some fun with friends. Life is not only College and Home.

632
00:46:41,244 --> 00:46:42,259
What about me?

633
00:46:42,728 --> 00:46:43,861
You also can go.

634
00:46:44,431 --> 00:46:44,994
Come on.

635
00:47:17,811 --> 00:47:20,647
Just do it…whatever happens…

636
00:47:21,990 --> 00:47:25,771
Justice will be done for life in this world..

637
00:47:26,170 --> 00:47:29,834
Nothing happens if you keep thinking…

638
00:47:30,342 --> 00:47:35,092
Let’s invite all the hardships with love…

639
00:47:35,741 --> 00:47:40,848
Life is small….Hey…

640
00:47:44,053 --> 00:47:48,623
Let’s reach every happiness by giving it some space....

641
00:48:08,909 --> 00:48:09,731
Come over…crazy guy!

642
00:48:09,756 --> 00:48:10,199
Brother..Brother

643
00:48:10,224 --> 00:48:10,692
Yes dear

644
00:48:10,824 --> 00:48:12,839
Are these the waterfalls from Bahubali?

645
00:48:12,941 --> 00:48:15,183
Yes, and he is Kalakeya

646
00:48:43,276 --> 00:48:44,174
Hey…

647
00:48:44,221 --> 00:48:46,228
Boom Boom say Boom Boom hey

648
00:48:46,253 --> 00:48:48,049
Get your hands up Boom Boom hey..

649
00:48:48,111 --> 00:48:52,236
Let’s make all the sorrows, a zero…Oh my bro Oh my bro..

650
00:48:52,261 --> 00:48:56,447
Leave your narrow thoughts… Oh my bro Oh my bro..

651
00:48:56,705 --> 00:48:58,580
Boom Boom say Boom Boom hey

652
00:48:58,729 --> 00:49:00,565
Get your hands up Boom Boom hey..

653
00:49:00,596 --> 00:49:04,551
Life has to be crazy my bro..

654
00:49:04,791 --> 00:49:07,166
Life has to be crazy

655
00:49:07,276 --> 00:49:09,072
my bro..

656
00:49:10,221 --> 00:49:13,401
If there is hope, even a little of it

657
00:49:14,455 --> 00:49:18,314
Won’t all happies be a goldmine…

658
00:49:18,533 --> 00:49:22,494
Be it a bypass or a N.H,

659
00:49:22,807 --> 00:49:27,721
we will reach the destination if there is a route…

660
00:49:28,057 --> 00:49:33,447
One and only life for every being…Hey…

661
00:49:36,502 --> 00:49:41,033
Let’s welcome every second of it…Hey!

662
00:49:47,223 --> 00:49:47,838
One

663
00:49:48,244 --> 00:49:48,830
Two

664
00:49:49,033 --> 00:49:49,713
Three

665
00:49:49,994 --> 00:49:51,861
Can we together on my bike?

666
00:49:57,095 --> 00:49:58,104
why two bikes?

667
00:50:03,423 --> 00:50:05,393
You need to be cognizant of the deteriorating Petrol reserves.

668
00:50:06,627 --> 00:50:10,846
What can we do to not endanger our future generations?

669
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:12,049
What can we do?

670
00:50:13,095 --> 00:50:20,557
Same College, same bike. We need to step forward towards realizing this goal.

671
00:50:24,176 --> 00:50:27,192
The beginning of any great accomplishment is ONE (Person)

672
00:50:27,986 --> 00:50:34,166
In this process, I am OK to even travel with you on your scooty

673
00:50:40,916 --> 00:50:43,018
Can we go together today at least?

674
00:51:40,033 --> 00:51:42,322
Looks like brother got pissed off

675
00:51:52,509 --> 00:51:52,900
Bye!

676
00:51:54,212 --> 00:51:55,408
Serious…

677
00:51:58,517 --> 00:51:59,134
Anand

678
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:00,540
can we go to the beach?

679
00:52:00,759 --> 00:52:05,298
When it comes to females, a male heart melts like ice

680
00:52:07,470 --> 00:52:09,322
Serious looks do not really suit you.

681
00:52:11,431 --> 00:52:13,001
Cheer up Anand Krishna!

682
00:52:29,509 --> 00:52:32,822
Isn’t the sea very bewitching on a full moon day?

683
00:52:33,634 --> 00:52:37,400
Yes, and I am seeing you for the second time on such an occasion

684
00:52:37,783 --> 00:52:38,540
Second time?

685
00:52:39,337 --> 00:52:40,626
When was the first time then?

686
00:52:41,728 --> 00:52:42,626
In my dreams.

687
00:52:43,939 --> 00:52:46,697
I am serious Geeta. I had imagined a Girl like you,

688
00:52:48,455 --> 00:52:50,517
like this...on full moon night

689
00:52:51,618 --> 00:52:52,712
beautiful sea

690
00:52:53,189 --> 00:52:55,978
wearing a white dress and gazing at the moon.

691
00:52:58,392 --> 00:53:01,689
I could not believe my eyes when I had first seen you for real.

692
00:53:02,497 --> 00:53:04,439
I kept staring at you

693
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:07,595
Yes, you were staring at me?

694
00:53:07,705 --> 00:53:08,884
Did you also see me that day?

695
00:53:09,142 --> 00:53:10,142
Yes, for the second time

696
00:53:10,501 --> 00:53:12,595
Second? Where was the first?

697
00:53:13,103 --> 00:53:14,993
You were going past our house

698
00:53:17,618 --> 00:53:21,829
This is for sure his deed. The guy above must have done this

699
00:53:22,681 --> 00:53:25,033
The guy above…who?

700
00:53:25,434 --> 00:53:26,665
who else...God

701
00:53:30,497 --> 00:53:33,619
I was minding my way when he diverted me towards your home.

702
00:53:36,892 --> 00:53:38,681
It is okay that he did,

703
00:53:39,634 --> 00:53:43,657
but he showed me to you and not vice-versa.
He had left you to my imagination

704
00:53:45,368 --> 00:53:53,634
and when I finally found you,
he made me search every nook and corner of Vizag.

705
00:53:55,369 --> 00:53:58,197
When I almost left my hope that you were for real

706
00:53:58,939 --> 00:54:01,072
he made you stand by side with a smile on your face.

707
00:54:04,064 --> 00:54:09,986
he made you sit beside me with smile...to convey all this to you

708
00:54:13,009 --> 00:54:14,884
What else does he have in stock for me?

709
00:54:15,525 --> 00:54:16,330
What else!

710
00:54:16,705 --> 00:54:19,236
He wants you to go home

711
00:54:22,861 --> 00:54:27,712
You should not have let that moment gone. That was the best situation

712
00:54:27,994 --> 00:54:28,806
What for?

713
00:54:28,831 --> 00:54:29,884
Expressing your love

714
00:54:32,095 --> 00:54:32,759
So soon?

715
00:54:33,189 --> 00:54:34,705
How many more days do you need?

716
00:54:35,947 --> 00:54:36,955
It is not about days,

717
00:54:38,087 --> 00:54:40,650
just to understand what does she think about me

718
00:54:40,876 --> 00:54:43,080
For you know that, first she should know that you love her

719
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:48,618
No way one will know about your love other than letting them know

720
00:54:48,891 --> 00:54:51,032
Let he know brother. You anyways have to do it one fine day

721
00:54:53,837 --> 00:54:56,711
If not for Surya proposing her, Paddu would have never known

722
00:54:57,134 --> 00:55:00,540
Telugu women are very intelligent.

723
00:55:01,134 --> 00:55:03,134
They make you tell them how much you love them.

724
00:55:06,345 --> 00:55:09,173
No woman would reject a guy like you

725
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:11,485
True Krish! She will definitely say a yes

726
00:55:11,845 --> 00:55:12,876
Wow...

727
00:55:13,798 --> 00:55:14,681
Super

728
00:55:15,392 --> 00:55:17,892
who else like us..except our friends

729
00:55:18,571 --> 00:55:19,251
Krish!

730
00:55:19,915 --> 00:55:21,814
we are the number one show in Vizag

731
00:55:24,368 --> 00:55:26,978
and out listener count is half a million now

732
00:55:29,782 --> 00:55:31,712
Brother, what have you decided?

733
00:55:34,063 --> 00:55:36,586
Such things are easier said than done

734
00:55:36,884 --> 00:55:40,048
What a Following For this Fake Story!..

735
00:55:41,376 --> 00:55:42,829
Unbelievable

736
00:55:42,892 --> 00:55:45,110
Are you still assuming this is fake ?

737
00:55:48,642 --> 00:55:50,431
What have you decided Krish?

738
00:55:52,064 --> 00:55:53,236
Does Geeta listen to FM?

739
00:55:53,501 --> 00:55:54,712
No clue

740
00:55:55,064 --> 00:55:55,876
When are you proposing her?

741
00:55:57,759 --> 00:55:59,767
Do it brother. You will have to do it anyway

742
00:56:00,087 --> 00:56:04,189
Anand always has his plans. We do not have to worry

743
00:56:10,165 --> 00:56:11,665
What are you thinking?

744
00:56:16,103 --> 00:56:17,759
Geeta is elder to me

745
00:56:20,743 --> 00:56:23,134
How can a girl from the same batch be elder to you?

746
00:56:23,431 --> 00:56:25,024
She is 1 year elder to me

747
00:56:27,008 --> 00:56:30,501
Such petty things do not matter, as long as you like Geeta

748
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:31,571
Thank you mom!

749
00:56:59,314 --> 00:57:04,509
Poets weave a thin cloth for you with their golden imaginative threads…

750
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:10,681
painters bestow divinity to the shape…

751
00:57:12,853 --> 00:57:15,197
The sea offers her pearls…

752
00:57:16,220 --> 00:57:17,916
mines give you gold…

753
00:57:18,525 --> 00:57:23,736
Spring forests gift their pretty flowers for your decoration

754
00:57:24,884 --> 00:57:26,088
What can I give you?

755
00:57:27,103 --> 00:57:31,338
The smile on your lips when you see me

756
00:57:32,392 --> 00:57:35,142
and a never-ending happiness if you wish so…

757
00:57:35,767 --> 00:57:36,736
I Love you Geeta!

758
00:58:18,744 --> 00:58:19,244
Hai

759
00:58:21,399 --> 00:58:23,814
When did you come to India?

760
00:58:24,478 --> 00:58:25,837
2 days

761
00:58:29,478 --> 00:58:30,564
She is in your room.

762
00:58:31,611 --> 00:58:33,962
She does not want to go with he mom

763
00:58:47,626 --> 00:58:50,525
I will stay with you

764
00:59:39,533 --> 00:59:40,150
Let’s go

765
00:59:40,205 --> 00:59:41,611
No!

766
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:42,813
Wait!

767
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:45,759
What do you think about yourself?

768
00:59:46,384 --> 00:59:48,103
Can you find a guy better than Anand?

769
00:59:49,978 --> 00:59:51,533
What do you girls need basically?

770
01:00:02,103 --> 01:00:07,837
Listen to Krish on Radio City. You will understand what you are missing

771
01:00:19,970 --> 01:00:23,134
Geeta does not like her little sweetheart going

772
01:00:28,017 --> 01:00:31,962
Sorry Krish! We should not have forced you

773
01:00:32,860 --> 01:00:36,321
as you said...we should have waited for some time

774
01:00:36,619 --> 01:00:40,892
Without the girl having any liking
the reply will be the same whenever you propose

775
01:00:43,165 --> 01:00:46,955
She prefers you as a good friend than a lover

776
01:00:47,313 --> 01:00:52,236
All these girls are like this
They need college students to hang around, but software engineers to marry

777
01:00:54,455 --> 01:00:56,994
Don’t we have the right to think even?

778
01:00:57,353 --> 01:01:01,298
We do not ask you go jump into the sea for you to think about it
 it is just a love proposal

779
01:01:02,696 --> 01:01:04,845
You men never were able to understand us

780
01:01:05,306 --> 01:01:06,603
Can you all please stop your nonsense?

781
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:09,486
why do you leave the main point

782
01:01:10,150 --> 01:01:16,048
Look Krish, there is no guy in Vizag
who never had failed in love and never had Mansion House.

783
01:01:16,477 --> 01:01:19,134
Let me know if you need company

784
01:01:19,501 --> 01:01:24,923
You are 100% correct brother
1 week of spend for a girlfriend can give us one full year of Vodka!

785
01:01:25,087 --> 01:01:30,080
Krish knows where exactly to stop
What is the kick, had the girl accepted his love?

786
01:01:34,048 --> 01:01:36,900
Krish... I just send Primetime Proposal to the head office

787
01:01:40,352 --> 01:01:43,055
Now tell me, isn’t there anything called love failure?

788
01:01:43,375 --> 01:01:44,766
It’s Seenu

789
01:01:44,985 --> 01:01:46,102
Yes, there is nothing called Love Failure

790
01:01:46,275 --> 01:01:48,322
Didn’t your girlfriend reject your love proposal

791
01:01:48,689 --> 01:01:50,939
I was rejected, not love

792
01:01:52,744 --> 01:01:53,619
Did not get you!

793
01:01:53,923 --> 01:01:55,267
what is there not to understand?

794
01:01:55,939 --> 01:01:57,111
Love never fails

795
01:01:57,540 --> 01:02:02,970
A statement that love does not fail is not enough, you need to elaborate

796
01:02:04,423 --> 01:02:05,790
How do I explain him?

797
01:02:05,962 --> 01:02:11,602
This is precisely the reason why a show
should always go as per a script and not with improvisations

798
01:02:11,673 --> 01:02:13,033
You will hit such dead-ends!

799
01:02:13,712 --> 01:02:16,158
‘Love does not fail’ – it is just a logical thought

800
01:02:16,540 --> 01:02:18,494
and I am not sure if Seenu has the maturity to understand this.

801
01:02:19,017 --> 01:02:21,822
Let us see if Krish has the courage to explain this to the audience understanding…

802
01:02:23,352 --> 01:02:25,915
let's see... this story turns which way

803
01:02:26,408 --> 01:02:27,954
I will try to explain this to you.

804
01:02:28,673 --> 01:02:33,470
Tell me one thing, did you meet the girl after she had rejected you?

805
01:02:33,611 --> 01:02:34,064
No

806
01:02:34,329 --> 01:02:35,157
Why?

807
01:02:35,415 --> 01:02:37,853
How can we meet again after she rejected on my face?

808
01:02:37,962 --> 01:02:40,111
Ok, so you just started drinking after that?

809
01:02:40,267 --> 01:02:43,173
You did not allow me to die, what else can I do then?

810
01:02:43,939 --> 01:02:49,439
If your love is so eternal, instead of binge drinking,
did you bother to ask her the reason for her rejection even?

811
01:02:49,767 --> 01:02:53,212
It is easier said than done brother. Did you ask your lover?

812
01:02:53,384 --> 01:02:56,494
I would not have advised you without myself deciding to ask

813
01:02:56,775 --> 01:02:57,908
Why late then? Go and ask her

814
01:02:57,977 --> 01:03:01,524
Super decision Krish! Go and talk to her

815
01:03:01,790 --> 01:03:03,564
Just think over it Krish

816
01:03:03,962 --> 01:03:08,095
You will never know if you keep thinking. Go and ask her Krish

817
01:03:08,642 --> 01:03:11,470
Don’t act in haste, they are just trying to provoke you

818
01:03:11,759 --> 01:03:13,923
Don’t listen to these women

819
01:03:14,212 --> 01:03:15,908
This is just the twist I like.

820
01:03:17,220 --> 01:03:19,283
Krish..I will be waiting for the next show

821
01:03:32,658 --> 01:03:38,611
Not that you should not ask...
your friendship should not be spoilt by doing so

822
01:03:39,267 --> 01:03:43,439
No harm in him expressing his love
You just need to explain him the reason for your rejection

823
01:03:45,876 --> 01:03:50,790
Looks like Krish does not have the right experience in dealing with girls.
She had left him without saying anything and now she will slap him!

824
01:04:33,602 --> 01:04:35,305
Do you think that I need to change myself Geeta?

825
01:04:40,048 --> 01:04:46,157
I am sure there must be something wrong in me for a friend like you to reject.

826
01:04:48,017 --> 01:04:49,454
Is it because that I am younger to you?

827
01:04:51,509 --> 01:04:56,189
If so, I am the unluckiest guy in the whole of Vizag.

828
01:04:57,594 --> 01:05:06,243
I do not have goal for myself…friends…parties…. why will you even adore me?

829
01:05:09,361 --> 01:05:11,353
Did I say anything about the reason?

830
01:05:12,579 --> 01:05:15,493
Why do you make yourself less

831
01:05:16,540 --> 01:05:19,806
I could only think of these Geeta

832
01:05:20,439 --> 01:05:25,415
There are not the reasons and in fact you are not the reason

833
01:05:29,814 --> 01:05:35,509
Why don’t you read Bhagavad-Gita
every morning instead of spending time on those books?

834
01:05:39,634 --> 01:05:44,447
You do not stop doing this and
she does not stop giving you an earful either!

835
01:05:47,634 --> 01:05:50,658
6 Years after our marriage,

836
01:05:51,166 --> 01:05:52,978
I was reading this ‘Geetanjali’

837
01:05:53,634 --> 01:05:59,666
when your mom came and whispered the news of your arrival.

838
01:06:01,142 --> 01:06:08,939
I could not get enough of my ‘Geetanjali’s’ smiles
and read enough of Ravindranath’s ‘Geetanjali’ ever since

839
01:06:10,267 --> 01:06:10,720
Geeta,

840
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:17,009
day after tomorrow is an auspicious day.
Step into your college at 7:10 AM sharp

841
01:06:17,353 --> 01:06:19,790
They don’t even open the college gate by then

842
01:06:20,111 --> 01:06:24,517
I told you not to prefer such colleges.

843
01:06:25,001 --> 01:06:28,501
Why do you have to go that far for such a college?

844
01:06:28,790 --> 01:06:32,892
Ok mom! I will try and request the watchman to open the gate

845
01:06:33,189 --> 01:06:36,876
or at least put my foot in from around the corner

846
01:06:38,415 --> 01:06:41,017
You both never take my words seriously

847
01:06:43,181 --> 01:06:43,962
Mom

848
01:06:44,548 --> 01:06:47,087
I think your mom does not like you going so far

849
01:06:58,853 --> 01:07:01,743
The only train is half an hour late.

850
01:07:02,353 --> 01:07:03,416
What can we do now?

851
01:07:06,993 --> 01:07:08,501
Maybe a cup of coffee will do!

852
01:07:39,759 --> 01:07:41,517
with beautiful green grass fields....

853
01:07:42,150 --> 01:07:43,939
reed bed as the roof of the huts....

854
01:07:44,220 --> 01:07:46,025
with the misty surroundings.....

855
01:07:46,377 --> 01:07:48,353
our beautiful village...like a Pretty Girl

856
01:07:55,572 --> 01:07:56,424
One coffee please!

857
01:07:59,751 --> 01:08:01,408
with traditional rangolis.....

858
01:08:01,595 --> 01:08:02,955
and marigolds all around....

859
01:08:03,314 --> 01:08:04,689
accompanied by the fields of Red chillis....

860
01:08:04,947 --> 01:08:06,697
ready for our festival

861
01:08:07,767 --> 01:08:08,424
Madam coffee!

862
01:08:08,924 --> 01:08:09,744
Thank you

863
01:08:21,782 --> 01:08:23,220
I am Anjali, and you?

864
01:08:24,314 --> 01:08:25,088
Prakash

865
01:08:25,447 --> 01:08:26,861
‘Geetanjali’ Prakash?

866
01:08:29,657 --> 01:08:35,056
in your happy life, Suddenly one day you got to know that... you have cancer!

867
01:08:36,681 --> 01:08:42,517
in your last days, instead of your native place,you decided to stay peacefully in Ooty

868
01:08:42,650 --> 01:08:43,228
No..No

869
01:08:43,517 --> 01:08:44,710
i am not the guy with cancer and I do not have any such diseases

870
01:08:45,158 --> 01:08:45,970
Prakash,

871
01:08:46,509 --> 01:08:47,759
can I ask you one thing?

872
01:08:47,978 --> 01:08:48,494
Yes

873
01:08:48,884 --> 01:08:52,202
Who is that young girl with the traditional dress in your poem?

874
01:08:53,507 --> 01:08:59,267
that girl...wearing Traditional Ghagra..Beutiful Half Saree

875
01:08:59,595 --> 01:09:00,955
Oh, that lady? My friend

876
01:09:01,549 --> 01:09:02,806
Friend?

877
01:09:02,892 --> 01:09:04,892
Girlfriend rather

878
01:09:05,463 --> 01:09:06,549
Girlfriend

879
01:09:07,416 --> 01:09:08,580
Where does she stay?

880
01:09:09,166 --> 01:09:09,900
In the US

881
01:09:13,267 --> 01:09:17,322
Oh, so there are girls who wear traditional dress in the USA

882
01:09:17,494 --> 01:09:18,525
Can I see her?

883
01:09:18,963 --> 01:09:20,002
Why do you have to see her?

884
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:27,220
Is she as pretty as me?

885
01:09:27,775 --> 01:09:29,947
Ah, she is pretty

886
01:09:30,392 --> 01:09:34,374
She may be pretty, but is she a topper like me in academics.

887
01:09:35,642 --> 01:09:42,015
India’s best engineering college had offered me a seat

888
01:09:42,603 --> 01:09:43,416
B.I.I.T?

889
01:09:43,556 --> 01:09:45,095
Yes, how do you know?

890
01:09:45,275 --> 01:09:46,877
My friend works as a faculty there

891
01:09:47,095 --> 01:09:48,611
Are you coming to Ooty as well?

892
01:09:48,759 --> 01:09:50,384
No, I am heading back

893
01:09:50,939 --> 01:09:51,892
Is it?

894
01:09:52,595 --> 01:09:53,197
Why?

895
01:09:53,463 --> 01:09:56,187
I did not find what I was looking for in Ooty

896
01:09:56,353 --> 01:09:58,759
How will you find when Anjali had not stepped in yet?

897
01:09:59,751 --> 01:10:01,939
Prakash, I am not sure what you were looking for,

898
01:10:03,251 --> 01:10:06,681
but these many days you were staying in the Ooty...without Anjali

899
01:10:06,783 --> 01:10:09,743
but once in step in…

900
01:10:09,776 --> 01:10:10,525
Once you step in?

901
01:10:11,142 --> 01:10:12,455
Flowers will be full of life

902
01:10:13,306 --> 01:10:14,876
streams will get a movement,

903
01:10:15,345 --> 01:10:16,736
Air will jump in joy,

904
01:10:17,009 --> 01:10:22,439
nature will be thrilled in ecstasy and overall, the Spring will celebrate

905
01:10:22,970 --> 01:10:25,853
If you stay here for long, you will miss the train

906
01:10:26,890 --> 01:10:30,296
Didn’t you like my peom?

907
01:10:30,564 --> 01:10:31,533
It is good

908
01:10:31,830 --> 01:10:32,439
Is it good?

909
01:10:32,916 --> 01:10:33,431
See..

910
01:10:33,681 --> 01:10:35,681
you are here..to go to Ooty by Train...Right?

911
01:10:36,728 --> 01:10:37,525
yes..yes

912
01:10:37,578 --> 01:10:39,469
Finish your coffee and catch the train.

913
01:10:39,985 --> 01:10:41,860
If you miss it, you will have to take a taxi

914
01:10:43,126 --> 01:10:46,259
Oh, I almost forgot!

915
01:10:48,165 --> 01:10:49,853
Hot coffee turned cold

916
01:10:52,642 --> 01:10:53,400
Mine too

917
01:11:02,954 --> 01:11:05,525
Time flies when I am with you

918
01:11:05,962 --> 01:11:08,993
You are leaving when Anjali just arrived

919
01:11:09,134 --> 01:11:11,681
I have to leave

920
01:11:12,993 --> 01:11:16,165
you are about to join a great college. Study well!

921
01:11:18,095 --> 01:11:20,423
I should have come a few days before

922
01:11:37,915 --> 01:11:39,118
New joiner?

923
01:11:39,290 --> 01:11:39,822
vooo..voo

924
01:11:40,118 --> 01:11:41,845
Are you dumb?

925
01:11:43,079 --> 01:11:44,189
I can speak

926
01:11:44,564 --> 01:11:45,228
What is your name?

927
01:11:46,962 --> 01:11:47,892
Anjali

928
01:11:48,001 --> 01:11:50,783
Don’t you know that you have to tell your full name?

929
01:11:51,298 --> 01:11:52,353
Geetanjali

930
01:11:52,657 --> 01:11:54,439
Where is Prakash then?

931
01:11:55,806 --> 01:11:57,603
I am not Maniratnam’s ‘Geetanjali’

932
01:11:57,931 --> 01:11:58,993
I am Tagore’s ‘Geetanjali’!

933
01:11:59,751 --> 01:12:01,735
When did Chiru do ‘Geetanjali’?

934
01:12:02,454 --> 01:12:04,837
Whatever ‘Geetanjali’ you are,

935
01:12:05,399 --> 01:12:07,884
meet us in the cafeteria at noon

936
01:12:09,251 --> 01:12:09,665
Okay!

937
01:12:31,251 --> 01:12:32,196
May I come in sir?

938
01:12:34,001 --> 01:12:34,860
New joiner?

939
01:12:35,134 --> 01:12:35,712
voo..voo

940
01:12:36,939 --> 01:12:37,845
Are you dumb?

941
01:12:38,993 --> 01:12:40,228
I just joined today

942
01:12:40,728 --> 01:12:43,212
and my name is Gadde Geetanjali. I am from Vizag

943
01:12:43,642 --> 01:12:45,329
It is already a week since the classes began.

944
01:12:46,673 --> 01:12:47,001
Come in

945
01:13:21,149 --> 01:13:22,392
Pig faced!

946
01:13:32,110 --> 01:13:33,204
Hai Geetanjali!

947
01:13:35,259 --> 01:13:35,774
Hai!

948
01:13:36,321 --> 01:13:37,845
How was Murthy’s class?

949
01:13:40,907 --> 01:13:42,126
Be careful

950
01:13:44,415 --> 01:13:44,767
Mmm

951
01:14:41,821 --> 01:14:43,001
ohhhhhh....

952
01:14:48,056 --> 01:14:48,759
Aaaaaa....

953
01:14:48,798 --> 01:14:51,220
I think I saw you before.

954
01:14:52,290 --> 01:14:53,837
You were in my dreams, recently right?

955
01:14:55,595 --> 01:14:57,579
Oh, it this a dream as well?

956
01:14:58,212 --> 01:14:59,126
Can you please get up?

957
01:15:00,149 --> 01:15:03,243
Let me be for a while Prakash. It’s nice!

958
01:15:08,376 --> 01:15:10,235
Ohhhhhhh...God

959
01:15:21,689 --> 01:15:22,540
did he leave?

960
01:15:32,376 --> 01:15:33,173
Come get up

961
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:39,876
Thank you!

962
01:15:42,540 --> 01:15:49,181
If my lecturer sees me with a boy, he will a worried soul.

963
01:15:49,485 --> 01:15:54,462
Ok, leave it.
You did not stay when I had asked you, why did you come back again?

964
01:15:55,188 --> 01:15:56,907
Spring…Celebrations?

965
01:15:57,173 --> 01:15:59,923
Spring just began and celebrations are being planned.

966
01:16:00,626 --> 01:16:01,353
Where are you staying?

967
01:16:01,782 --> 01:16:02,454
Friend’s room.

968
01:16:03,618 --> 01:16:04,618
Isn’t it time for colleage?

969
01:16:06,280 --> 01:16:09,251
Oh my god! Today is Murthy sir’s first class

970
01:16:09,665 --> 01:16:11,407
and I have to be before time.

971
01:16:11,532 --> 01:16:13,696
Bye Prakash! I will meet you in the evening, ok!

972
01:16:31,632 --> 01:16:33,704
Can’t you be on time even for a day? Get out of my class!

973
01:16:33,735 --> 01:16:37,751
Sir, I was on time. You came early rather

974
01:16:37,776 --> 01:16:40,766
So, you teach me what time sense is… you stupid girl!

975
01:17:00,055 --> 01:17:00,555
Hai

976
01:17:06,476 --> 01:17:09,873
Looks like you are in a serious thought about something.

977
01:17:13,891 --> 01:17:14,805
If it is about love,

978
01:17:16,547 --> 01:17:20,383
let me help!

979
01:17:20,938 --> 01:17:23,938
We have been trying for 3 years.What will you do?

980
01:17:24,196 --> 01:17:25,172
Is he handsome?

981
01:17:25,546 --> 01:17:30,258
That is the issue! I cannot utter anything when I see him and I come back

982
01:17:30,664 --> 01:17:32,446
Why do YOU have to say it?

983
01:17:33,875 --> 01:17:38,124
However handsome guys might be, not more than us.

984
01:17:38,961 --> 01:17:44,343
They should forget themselves and stare at us.

985
01:17:46,258 --> 01:17:48,117
You do not have to go to him.

986
01:17:48,772 --> 01:17:53,969
Just stand in front of him and maintain eye contact.

987
01:17:54,594 --> 01:17:56,047
Do not bother about anyone else near you.

988
01:17:56,586 --> 01:18:00,508
Boys know very well why a girl does that.

989
01:18:03,102 --> 01:18:04,406
See you in the party!

990
01:18:15,203 --> 01:18:15,773
Hai

991
01:18:18,999 --> 01:18:20,391
How did you know that I am here?

992
01:18:20,648 --> 01:18:24,562
I am a pretty girl and I know where the poets are

993
01:18:24,953 --> 01:18:26,367
Who told you that I am a poet?

994
01:18:26,711 --> 01:18:32,226
No need for someone to tell me. I can figure it out just like that
as easy as having an ice-cream

995
01:18:32,586 --> 01:18:33,523
I am not a poet

996
01:18:33,867 --> 01:18:35,101
You can still have the ice-cream

997
01:19:03,671 --> 01:19:04,788
Who is that?

998
01:19:05,812 --> 01:19:06,656
I will check

999
01:19:13,250 --> 01:19:16,640
Is this how your guys thrown stones into a girl’s house?

1000
01:19:16,812 --> 01:19:18,148
I am not sure, I have never done that

1001
01:19:18,547 --> 01:19:21,195
how can you? there are no stones on the streets in America

1002
01:19:21,508 --> 01:19:22,898
Come Lets Have Coffee

1003
01:19:23,164 --> 01:19:25,320
I cannot… in this cold

1004
01:19:25,570 --> 01:19:28,351
I knew, I knew you would say this

1005
01:19:29,516 --> 01:19:36,734
On a cold morning in Ooty, if a girl invites you for a coffee…
do you know what the stalwart Sri Sri had said?

1006
01:19:37,577 --> 01:19:38,522
What would he say?

1007
01:19:42,211 --> 01:19:44,437
I got it in a piece of paper so that I do not miss out on the flow.

1008
01:19:48,866 --> 01:19:52,466
‘Coffee is calling…another cup of coffee is calling…

1009
01:19:52,771 --> 01:19:58,622
go ahead...go forward...towards the cafe nearby

1010
01:19:59,055 --> 01:20:07,047
all you lazy, lethargic, aged brothers… you die…
I am going out for a coffee with my girl’!

1011
01:20:08,578 --> 01:20:10,742
Who is that…die, jump?

1012
01:21:15,172 --> 01:21:16,305
What do you write in your diary?

1013
01:21:18,351 --> 01:21:21,273
You say you are not a poet and you keep writing something.

1014
01:21:22,430 --> 01:21:23,523
Who are you?

1015
01:21:24,086 --> 01:21:24,758
Prakash

1016
01:21:25,258 --> 01:21:28,094
Who is Prakash?

1017
01:21:30,054 --> 01:21:31,336
Won't you say?

1018
01:22:19,046 --> 01:22:23,046
something...in the diary...There is something

1019
01:22:29,633 --> 01:22:30,508
I got it.

1020
01:22:33,047 --> 01:22:37,984
I know all your secrets are in this diary!
I will get to know everything and return it safe

1021
01:22:38,117 --> 01:22:38,711
Ok

1022
01:22:47,430 --> 01:22:50,859
You are the sky

1023
01:22:51,344 --> 01:22:54,922
I am your cloud..

1024
01:22:55,422 --> 01:22:59,086
You are the happiness

1025
01:22:59,414 --> 01:23:03,039
And I am your smile…

1026
01:23:03,405 --> 01:23:07,030
I am time with all the seasons…

1027
01:23:07,406 --> 01:23:11,133
Bore fruit today for you….

1028
01:23:11,375 --> 01:23:15,086
I am the fun from a trickling cold breeze…

1029
01:23:15,430 --> 01:23:19,140
Shall I tickle you…without a momentary gap…

1030
01:23:19,367 --> 01:23:23,039
I will slip by your looks into your lap…

1031
01:23:23,437 --> 01:23:27,273
Will become a baby…

1032
01:23:27,414 --> 01:23:30,976
I cannot stop myself in your company…

1033
01:23:31,344 --> 01:23:35,172
Will be a waterfall…

1034
01:24:07,414 --> 01:24:11,125
Shall I be a woodfire in the cold mist…

1035
01:24:11,359 --> 01:24:15,163
Touching your body gently…

1036
01:24:15,437 --> 01:24:19,234
Shall I be the little drizzle in the hot summers…

1037
01:24:19,430 --> 01:24:23,390
Making you wet all over…

1038
01:24:23,437 --> 01:24:27,140
Shall I play the whole day

1039
01:24:27,422 --> 01:24:31,195
jumping here and there…Shall I run…

1040
01:24:31,375 --> 01:24:35,117
On those evenings after a tiring day…

1041
01:24:35,414 --> 01:24:39,297
Should I be the soothing lilly…

1042
01:24:59,367 --> 01:25:00,765
The man who designed Java is…

1043
01:25:03,719 --> 01:25:04,594
Are you even listening?

1044
01:25:06,281 --> 01:25:06,765
Mmm

1045
01:25:07,305 --> 01:25:09,180
Tell me who designed Java?

1046
01:25:13,258 --> 01:25:14,515
Did you even understand the question?

1047
01:25:17,226 --> 01:25:18,570
Aren’t there any options Sir?

1048
01:25:18,687 --> 01:25:19,242
Get Up

1049
01:25:22,922 --> 01:25:24,508
Do you know the answer or not?

1050
01:25:27,719 --> 01:25:31,812
You are here to study and not to day dream!

1051
01:25:41,148 --> 01:25:41,687
Hai

1052
01:25:44,414 --> 01:25:45,031
Hai

1053
01:25:45,062 --> 01:25:48,390
I told you not to take my diary
Now you are sulking after knowing about me

1054
01:25:51,648 --> 01:25:54,054
This is not a diary... This is a notebook

1055
01:25:55,273 --> 01:25:56,906
there is nothing about you

1056
01:25:57,758 --> 01:25:59,742
Is that a story you are writing is Movie?

1057
01:25:59,767 --> 01:26:00,117
Yes

1058
01:26:00,547 --> 01:26:01,523
is Mahesh the hero?

1059
01:26:01,875 --> 01:26:02,351
Nope

1060
01:26:02,742 --> 01:26:03,547
Is it Pawan Kalyan,

1061
01:26:06,250 --> 01:26:06,969
who else?

1062
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:14,241
My stories are not for stars, it is for people like you and me. A small love story

1063
01:26:15,273 --> 01:26:18,781
I like the way you described a woman

1064
01:26:19,422 --> 01:26:21,984
Looks like the woman resembles me

1065
01:26:24,758 --> 01:26:25,523
Hai

1066
01:26:25,750 --> 01:26:26,203
Hai

1067
01:26:26,351 --> 01:26:27,437
Till where have you come?

1068
01:26:27,515 --> 01:26:28,515
Till the party

1069
01:26:29,562 --> 01:26:30,367
Is it?

1070
01:26:30,648 --> 01:26:33,289
Be Ready, we will call you at 7

1071
01:26:33,555 --> 01:26:34,328
Ok

1072
01:26:37,476 --> 01:26:39,305
Prakash, come and join me for the party

1073
01:26:39,367 --> 01:26:40,125
Why me?

1074
01:26:40,414 --> 01:26:43,687
Me alone won’t be enough.

1075
01:26:44,398 --> 01:26:47,086
I need to take a revenge for all that we juniors had spent on them.

1076
01:26:48,680 --> 01:26:49,984
I will tell them that you are by boyfriend

1077
01:26:50,562 --> 01:26:52,070
It won’t look good

1078
01:26:52,203 --> 01:26:53,515
Oh, Prakash!

1079
01:26:53,547 --> 01:26:54,601
Bye, meet you tomorrow!

1080
01:26:54,640 --> 01:26:55,094
Oh mannn

1081
01:27:14,913 --> 01:27:19,265
What did you think of us when you gave us a treat?

1082
01:27:23,804 --> 01:27:24,921
Tell us, we won’t mind

1083
01:27:26,265 --> 01:27:27,156
Pig faced

1084
01:27:28,577 --> 01:27:30,608
We won’t think that way

1085
01:27:31,609 --> 01:27:35,343
You can think whatever you want, I need another chocolate

1086
01:27:35,523 --> 01:27:36,890
You should not eat more

1087
01:27:37,593 --> 01:27:38,882
Will you get me or not?

1088
01:27:47,078 --> 01:27:50,851
Come on babe…let’s rock!

1089
01:27:56,562 --> 01:28:00,203
Come on babe…let’s rock!

1090
01:28:08,015 --> 01:28:09,257
Murthy Sir

1091
01:28:10,593 --> 01:28:13,335
Please let Prakash know that I came here…

1092
01:28:14,772 --> 01:28:16,945
Please Tell Sir..

1093
01:28:20,546 --> 01:28:21,570
Sir…Sir

1094
01:28:32,578 --> 01:28:33,679
One

1095
01:28:35,820 --> 01:28:37,288
Two

1096
01:28:37,976 --> 01:28:39,390
Three

1097
01:28:41,078 --> 01:28:42,148
Ohhhh...

1098
01:28:45,367 --> 01:28:46,695
Guess the party went well

1099
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:51,976
The had to spend a bomb. They will never invite me a person like me.

1100
01:28:52,296 --> 01:28:54,616
It would have been good if you had joined as well.

1101
01:28:55,062 --> 01:29:00,132
I kept two chocolates aside for you anyways

1102
01:29:04,124 --> 01:29:05,132
Take it

1103
01:29:06,742 --> 01:29:07,468
Thank you

1104
01:29:07,843 --> 01:29:08,921
shall I accompany you to the hostel?

1105
01:29:10,546 --> 01:29:13,257
Did you really come to India for filming a movie?

1106
01:29:13,484 --> 01:29:15,351
Why did you even get that doubt?

1107
01:29:16,796 --> 01:29:19,124
Do you know what does an American guy like you

1108
01:29:20,562 --> 01:29:25,203
who wants to film the spring night and snow filled moonlight

1109
01:29:25,874 --> 01:29:34,898
as a love story would do to a pretty girl like me?

1110
01:29:35,210 --> 01:29:36,070
What does he do?

1111
01:29:36,749 --> 01:29:37,976
Don’t you know?

1112
01:29:38,062 --> 01:29:39,765
I do not know as well.

1113
01:29:41,226 --> 01:29:50,156
I got a bit greedy and had my tummy full, can we sit and talk?

1114
01:29:50,210 --> 01:29:51,046
Let’s go

1115
01:29:54,124 --> 01:29:56,640
No.No... the gate is open

1116
01:30:05,773 --> 01:30:10,671
What should we do, man with the dimples?

1117
01:30:12,132 --> 01:30:14,515
How long would you stare at me like that?

1118
01:30:16,281 --> 01:30:19,726
Don’t you know why a girl gets close to you?

1119
01:30:21,765 --> 01:30:32,601
Oh God, looks like I have to train him to kiss.

1120
01:30:34,210 --> 01:30:37,273
holding like thissssss.....

1121
01:30:39,593 --> 01:30:40,820
Ohhhhhh...

1122
01:30:46,101 --> 01:30:46,609
Ohhh....

1123
01:30:47,156 --> 01:30:50,249
What is the use in trying to teach you when your parents are the culprits?

1124
01:30:51,054 --> 01:30:52,835
What did my mom and dad do?

1125
01:30:53,507 --> 01:30:57,382
Had they given you the right upbringing,
would you have got drunk like this and misbehave?

1126
01:30:58,296 --> 01:30:59,726
What did I drink?

1127
01:30:59,859 --> 01:31:01,390
How do I know what Drink you had?

1128
01:31:01,570 --> 01:31:04,984
Murthy Sir, I do not get what you say!

1129
01:31:05,304 --> 01:31:06,945
You would not understand till the Drink goes down

1130
01:31:07,296 --> 01:31:09,093
What did I drink?

1131
01:31:09,445 --> 01:31:11,531
Whisky, Brandy…how do I know?

1132
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:14,249
Whisky???

1133
01:31:15,351 --> 01:31:16,749
When did I have that?

1134
01:31:17,265 --> 01:31:18,913
Can you please leave my room first?

1135
01:31:19,265 --> 01:31:22,132
I did not drink and I do not have such habits!

1136
01:31:22,288 --> 01:31:23,437
Will you leave or not?

1137
01:31:23,781 --> 01:31:26,070
I did not booze, you are deliberately trying to….

1138
01:31:26,202 --> 01:31:26,593
Get out!!!

1139
01:31:44,156 --> 01:31:45,070
Where is Anjali?

1140
01:31:46,640 --> 01:31:47,609
I am asking you!

1141
01:31:48,484 --> 01:31:51,913
Prakash, you seem to have forgotten the reason you came here

1142
01:31:52,015 --> 01:31:53,679
What is that I am asking and what is that you saying?

1143
01:31:53,882 --> 01:31:55,210
I am saying this for your own good,

1144
01:31:55,929 --> 01:31:57,390
you are not on the right path

1145
01:31:57,929 --> 01:31:59,976
What happened?

1146
01:32:34,023 --> 01:32:35,132
Did Anjali come to the class?

1147
01:32:35,812 --> 01:32:38,820
It is not my job to track who came to the class and who did not

1148
01:32:39,023 --> 01:32:41,827
Tell her that I wanted to meet her

1149
01:32:52,312 --> 01:32:55,273
What does a boy ask a girl he newly met, as a first thing?

1150
01:33:03,171 --> 01:33:07,453
We may or may not find what we are searching for…
if you keep searching at the same place

1151
01:33:28,781 --> 01:33:29,296
Hello!

1152
01:33:29,546 --> 01:33:29,953
Hai!

1153
01:33:30,789 --> 01:33:31,250
Who?

1154
01:33:31,578 --> 01:33:34,601
What does a boy ask a girl he newly met, as a first thing?

1155
01:33:36,101 --> 01:33:36,843
Prakash

1156
01:33:37,328 --> 01:33:38,039
Where are you?

1157
01:33:38,820 --> 01:33:39,562
Temple

1158
01:33:39,937 --> 01:33:41,695
Temple? Didn’t you go to the college?

1159
01:33:42,562 --> 01:33:43,195
I did not

1160
01:33:43,742 --> 01:33:44,539
Why?

1161
01:33:45,289 --> 01:33:50,039
I had to apologize for the mistake I did

1162
01:33:50,523 --> 01:33:51,539
What mistake?

1163
01:33:52,343 --> 01:33:55,476
For having those alcoholic chocolates!

1164
01:33:55,601 --> 01:33:58,577
That’s ok, God will consider your apologies

1165
01:34:08,914 --> 01:34:14,296
I keep saying that you have a smiling face
and just about the time when she is expected you have become dull

1166
01:34:14,547 --> 01:34:15,383
She?

1167
01:34:16,468 --> 01:34:18,703
That lady in the traditional dress with a fog dupatta!

1168
01:34:19,906 --> 01:34:20,586
Is it?

1169
01:34:21,500 --> 01:34:23,078
Why is she coming now?

1170
01:34:23,750 --> 01:34:25,968
To confirm if I had said the truth

1171
01:34:28,125 --> 01:34:32,812
Why does she have to come this far just to see if I was smiling or crying?

1172
01:34:33,828 --> 01:34:34,984
When is she coming?

1173
01:34:43,554 --> 01:34:45,109
I warned you not come towards my room

1174
01:34:45,742 --> 01:34:47,250
Prakash asked me to

1175
01:34:47,539 --> 01:34:49,234
Exams notification is out.

1176
01:34:53,085 --> 01:34:55,039
The person who offered you a seat here should be blamed.

1177
01:35:13,734 --> 01:35:14,991
How was the journey sister?

1178
01:35:15,023 --> 01:35:16,070
It went well Murthy.

1179
01:35:17,843 --> 01:35:18,500
Hai Anjali!

1180
01:35:20,398 --> 01:35:20,945
My sister

1181
01:35:23,468 --> 01:35:24,578
Hai sisterinlaw

1182
01:35:30,484 --> 01:35:35,406
Traditional dress, fog dupatta… that was you right?

1183
01:35:38,406 --> 01:35:40,015
Will you let her in first?

1184
01:35:42,116 --> 01:35:43,086
Sure Brother

1185
01:35:46,944 --> 01:35:48,710
What do your parents do Anjali?

1186
01:35:48,749 --> 01:35:52,272
Dad is a professor in Andhra University and Mom is a homemaker

1187
01:35:53,601 --> 01:35:55,765
Do your parents know about Prakash?

1188
01:35:56,712 --> 01:35:59,780
His likes and everything about him?

1189
01:36:00,444 --> 01:36:01,202
Everything?

1190
01:36:01,515 --> 01:36:04,054
His cinema dreams, not everyone will be comfortable with that

1191
01:36:04,265 --> 01:36:06,140
Why will they not like cinema?

1192
01:36:06,444 --> 01:36:08,288
Everyone likes to watch movies,

1193
01:36:08,507 --> 01:36:12,538
but they do not quite like people pursuing it as a career

1194
01:36:12,991 --> 01:36:15,835
Dad has respect Literature and Artists.

1195
01:36:16,921 --> 01:36:19,140
They will never say no to my likes.

1196
01:36:20,716 --> 01:36:26,476
Will your mom and dad like me,
given that I can only watch movies and not make them?

1197
01:36:29,812 --> 01:36:32,990
We lost our parents when we were kids.

1198
01:36:33,858 --> 01:36:35,554
Prakash and I were brought up by our brother in law

1199
01:36:37,950 --> 01:36:45,286
Do not feel bad. I will adapt you all and then you will have a family.

1200
01:36:45,780 --> 01:36:48,780
Give me that little one as my dowry

1201
01:36:48,937 --> 01:36:49,999
What dowry?

1202
01:36:50,218 --> 01:36:54,023
Oh, don’t you know this?

1203
01:36:55,421 --> 01:36:58,405
The trend of late is that girls take dowry instead of giving

1204
01:36:59,218 --> 01:37:00,812
that too..you are from film Industry

1205
01:37:02,952 --> 01:37:05,007
Why are you laughing sis?

1206
01:37:05,202 --> 01:37:07,984
Anjali wants this little one as her dowry

1207
01:37:08,960 --> 01:37:09,679
Dowry?

1208
01:37:10,726 --> 01:37:11,616
Nice girl!

1209
01:37:30,077 --> 01:37:31,663
Someone!...

1210
01:37:31,843 --> 01:37:33,241
Someone!....

1211
01:37:33,687 --> 01:37:36,780
exaggerated! Who are you?

1212
01:37:37,218 --> 01:37:40,311
The dream or the art…!

1213
01:37:40,694 --> 01:37:44,257
Who are you?

1214
01:37:44,288 --> 01:37:47,593
The shining in the daylight…!

1215
01:37:47,741 --> 01:37:50,882
Careless fun...

1216
01:37:51,178 --> 01:37:54,467
Summer lilly’s look a like…

1217
01:37:54,734 --> 01:37:57,851
Venue for a celabration…!

1218
01:38:39,765 --> 01:38:46,842
Your honey coated eyes…are they to hunt…

1219
01:38:46,913 --> 01:38:53,554
Are those little smiling sounds…to defeat me..

1220
01:38:53,749 --> 01:39:00,515
No news till now in the air…

1221
01:39:00,812 --> 01:39:07,859
Gossiping trance…because of you..

1222
01:39:08,288 --> 01:39:09,710
Someone!....

1223
01:39:10,007 --> 01:39:11,437
Someone!....

1224
01:39:11,819 --> 01:39:14,937
exaggerated! Who are you?

1225
01:39:15,319 --> 01:39:18,412
The dream or the art…!

1226
01:39:18,812 --> 01:39:22,351
Who are you?

1227
01:39:43,312 --> 01:39:49,974
The magic changed its form to you…

1228
01:39:50,312 --> 01:39:57,396
Met me the other day…chasing me all over…

1229
01:39:57,538 --> 01:40:04,318
Another world touched the heart gently…

1230
01:40:04,538 --> 01:40:11,951
Should I seek you in the presence of these moments…

1231
01:40:19,734 --> 01:40:21,249
Why do you have to go now?

1232
01:40:21,640 --> 01:40:22,914
Will be back in a week

1233
01:40:23,171 --> 01:40:25,156
What will happen if you do not go, it is only for a week right?

1234
01:40:25,492 --> 01:40:27,945
Some work there. It will helpful to my sister if I go

1235
01:40:28,648 --> 01:40:29,999
Shall I come as well?

1236
01:40:30,109 --> 01:40:30,953
Why?

1237
01:40:33,468 --> 01:40:36,023
I mean, I will be back in a week

1238
01:40:38,975 --> 01:40:42,124
You both come to Vizag as soon as your exams are over.

1239
01:40:43,015 --> 01:40:43,429
Mmm...

1240
01:40:44,453 --> 01:40:45,202
Bye Murthy!

1241
01:40:45,327 --> 01:40:45,999
Bye Sister!

1242
01:41:08,898 --> 01:41:09,539
Stop…

1243
01:41:10,523 --> 01:41:11,046
Stop…

1244
01:41:11,453 --> 01:41:12,773
Hey...Stop…

1245
01:41:17,382 --> 01:41:18,992
I will get down at the hostel

1246
01:41:19,601 --> 01:41:20,117
Ok

1247
01:41:27,070 --> 01:41:28,164
Please stop near the hostel

1248
01:41:31,312 --> 01:41:34,647
No.. No.. don’t stop! I have nothing to do there now,

1249
01:41:34,937 --> 01:41:37,078
will give you guys a send-off at the station and will go back

1250
01:42:02,014 --> 01:42:08,109
Why are you not saying anything?
I will get down at ‘Mettupallayam’ and head back.

1251
01:42:12,273 --> 01:42:13,437
don’t believe me, right?

1252
01:42:13,796 --> 01:42:14,999
No, we do!

1253
01:42:16,593 --> 01:42:22,460
How can you be so good all the time?
It is not always smiling, you should also show your anger when needed as well

1254
01:42:35,452 --> 01:42:38,882
Booked the cab. You will get a call on your mobile.
Call me as soon as you reach Ooty

1255
01:42:41,647 --> 01:42:45,780
I will be waiting for you. Come back soon!

1256
01:44:23,843 --> 01:44:26,437
Over! It’s all over!

1257
01:44:27,023 --> 01:44:29,585
I was always worried that this would happen!

1258
01:44:29,874 --> 01:44:30,648
What happened sir?

1259
01:44:31,585 --> 01:44:36,850
We do not have any other show for the No: 1 slot.
He ended the story and there is nothing to listen to in this show from tomorrow

1260
01:44:40,218 --> 01:44:42,265
We do know what to say Krish.

1261
01:44:42,874 --> 01:44:47,256
Should we feel happy that her love was a success
or should we feel bad that your love failed?

1262
01:44:48,890 --> 01:44:51,851
All the girls are the same.
They do not let you know anything till you are drowned

1263
01:44:52,632 --> 01:44:54,835
That girl’s behaviour was weird from the beginning itself!

1264
01:44:55,249 --> 01:44:58,804
Attempt was never made to understand that girl properly.That is the problem.

1265
01:44:59,663 --> 01:45:01,515
We understand your pain.

1266
01:45:02,171 --> 01:45:05,898
She is your friend and friend can only understand a friend’s love

1267
01:45:06,406 --> 01:45:12,101
Oh god!
A friend should understand a friend’s love? Who will understand a lover’s love then?

1268
01:45:12,984 --> 01:45:18,507
See Krish, this is quite common now a days!

1269
01:45:19,202 --> 01:45:23,445
Leave it.We will find a new lovely girl

1270
01:45:23,734 --> 01:45:26,335
The right advice in time. Krish, do not worry any more about this

1271
01:45:26,906 --> 01:45:29,890
Yes Krish, those you just advised you now cannot think of more

1272
01:45:30,460 --> 01:45:34,796
Can you please stop the crap?
You look for chances to fight with each other.

1273
01:45:35,515 --> 01:45:36,859
Whose problem is this? Krish’s or yours?

1274
01:45:37,577 --> 01:45:39,140
What should we do now?

1275
01:45:45,031 --> 01:45:45,929
Hello, Radio City!

1276
01:45:46,288 --> 01:45:47,616
Sir, why is Krish not picking up the call?

1277
01:45:47,781 --> 01:45:48,656
Krish just left

1278
01:45:49,007 --> 01:45:50,624
Krish left? The show it still on right?

1279
01:45:50,851 --> 01:45:53,171
Yes, but there is nothing else to say. It’s all over

1280
01:45:53,437 --> 01:45:54,109
All over?

1281
01:45:54,820 --> 01:45:55,179
Hello…

1282
01:45:55,835 --> 01:45:56,273
Hello…

1283
01:45:56,546 --> 01:45:56,929
Hello…

1284
01:46:17,140 --> 01:46:19,640
What should i say to the listeners if you leave suddenly like this?

1285
01:46:20,945 --> 01:46:21,843
I did not see the time Sir

1286
01:46:23,679 --> 01:46:25,406
Hmmm...ok. What are you planning for today's show?

1287
01:46:26,577 --> 01:46:29,898
It is only your love and affection that placed the show at the No: 1 spot

1288
01:46:30,226 --> 01:46:34,406
For it to continue like that, let us start our show today with a fresh topic.

1289
01:46:34,796 --> 01:46:36,905
How about childhood love?

1290
01:46:37,718 --> 01:46:38,710
childhood love

1291
01:46:39,390 --> 01:46:41,077
Let's see who our fresh caller is

1292
01:46:45,476 --> 01:46:45,991
Hello...

1293
01:46:46,320 --> 01:46:48,390
I don’t have any childhood stories

1294
01:46:49,366 --> 01:46:51,421
However, i have my doubts on the your story.

1295
01:46:52,530 --> 01:46:56,671
Not just me, in fact most of the listeners.

1296
01:47:00,390 --> 01:47:04,577
I do not deny the reason she gave to reject your love...

1297
01:47:06,609 --> 01:47:10,491
but...how did she land in Vizag from Ooty?

1298
01:47:13,303 --> 01:47:18,054
What happened to the guy who went to Ooty to script his movie?

1299
01:47:19,452 --> 01:47:24,812
And last but not the least,

1300
01:47:25,640 --> 01:47:28,788
May be it was only a 'story' she told just to reject you?

1301
01:47:30,945 --> 01:47:31,609
Yes!

1302
01:47:32,359 --> 01:47:37,570
You are not as dumb as i thought Seenu!
Those were just the right questions, keep them coming !

1303
01:47:44,640 --> 01:47:49,109
We are at the climax brother.
Clarify our doubts so that we can start with a new topic

1304
01:48:03,306 --> 01:48:04,118
Serious?

1305
01:48:05,720 --> 01:48:07,454
Is it because i travelled against your wish?

1306
01:48:08,126 --> 01:48:11,283
Did you express your liking for me at least once?

1307
01:48:11,470 --> 01:48:13,033
I really like you Anjali

1308
01:48:13,436 --> 01:48:16,681
Let it be! You don’t have to pretend just because I asked you.

1309
01:48:17,829 --> 01:48:21,509
I think it is only a one way thing from my side

1310
01:48:22,759 --> 01:48:25,709
every time i used to roam around you..this time also

1311
01:48:26,204 --> 01:48:28,533
True that you like me more than I do,

1312
01:48:29,134 --> 01:48:29,767
but

1313
01:48:29,829 --> 01:48:32,009
I am the first to like you.

1314
01:48:34,806 --> 01:48:38,702
Had you stayed for another moment that day,
I would have said how much I liked you.

1315
01:48:38,962 --> 01:48:42,454
I did not want to lose that happiness by expressing….

1316
01:48:42,759 --> 01:48:45,369
What is that happiness and why would you lose it?

1317
01:48:45,994 --> 01:48:47,751
You coming for me every day

1318
01:48:49,682 --> 01:48:51,267
looking around for me if I was not there…

1319
01:48:51,697 --> 01:48:53,603
those ice-creams, chocolates,

1320
01:48:54,127 --> 01:48:56,712
small fights with Murthy and many more to say…

1321
01:48:58,510 --> 01:49:01,127
Many girls are blessed with such happiness,

1322
01:49:01,439 --> 01:49:04,858
but it is only me who is blessed with Anjali!

1323
01:49:15,541 --> 01:49:17,213
Can’t you see?

1324
01:49:17,252 --> 01:49:19,353
he came upon us sir...

1325
01:49:19,541 --> 01:49:20,283
Where are you going?

1326
01:49:20,392 --> 01:49:21,838
Looks like that they got hurt

1327
01:49:30,517 --> 01:49:31,674
Sorry sir. Please don’t…

1328
01:49:31,799 --> 01:49:34,041
Don’t worry, I just came to check if you need any help

1329
01:49:34,066 --> 01:49:36,205
No worries Sir, I did not see you at the turning…Sorry Sir

1330
01:49:36,244 --> 01:49:37,619
Take Care

1331
01:49:37,908 --> 01:49:38,580
Thank You Sir

1332
01:49:44,283 --> 01:49:45,182
Hey Prakash,

1333
01:49:45,783 --> 01:49:46,994
you were doing something…Leave me

1334
01:50:01,111 --> 01:50:02,307
Leave me…Prakash

1335
01:50:02,588 --> 01:50:03,971
What did you ask me to do then?

1336
01:50:04,549 --> 01:50:05,783
Please..Leave me…

1337
01:50:05,916 --> 01:50:08,486
Let me be like this for a while, I like it…

1338
01:50:45,584 --> 01:50:49,322
Anjali came out of coma after 2 months

1339
01:50:50,853 --> 01:50:54,330
Keep her in observation for 24 hours and keep me updated every hour

1340
01:51:14,213 --> 01:51:18,228
I saw you somewhere. In my dream!

1341
01:51:20,572 --> 01:51:25,873
God.. where did you find this inncocent guy?

1342
01:51:54,119 --> 01:51:55,307
What did the doctor say uncle?

1343
01:51:55,471 --> 01:51:56,783
They will discharge her tomorrow

1344
01:52:21,174 --> 01:52:21,892
Have

1345
01:52:24,369 --> 01:52:25,080
Have some food Geeta

1346
01:52:27,260 --> 01:52:29,244
Eat...I Will

1347
01:52:31,291 --> 01:52:32,869
How long will I have to ask you like this?

1348
01:52:34,635 --> 01:52:35,689
It is really tiring

1349
01:52:51,752 --> 01:52:52,971
How long will you be like this?

1350
01:53:01,103 --> 01:53:01,767
Please have some food

1351
01:53:04,158 --> 01:53:06,041
Prakash is an innocent guy.

1352
01:53:09,227 --> 01:53:13,580
I am the one who chased him…and killed him

1353
01:53:14,197 --> 01:53:16,125
I also want to die....

1354
01:53:28,783 --> 01:53:31,204
She is Not listening to us

1355
01:53:43,939 --> 01:53:51,244
Knowing that it was not you, saying that you are responsible for it is stupidity.

1356
01:53:52,992 --> 01:53:56,799
Small Girl...she understood when we said

1357
01:53:58,002 --> 01:54:00,549
How do I explain you and how many times?

1358
01:54:02,049 --> 01:54:03,611
We are leaving to the US

1359
01:54:04,767 --> 01:54:07,774
and we will never come back to you Geeta

1360
01:54:10,525 --> 01:54:13,080
Prakash is not going to come back irrespective of what you do.

1361
01:54:15,195 --> 01:54:17,135
Say ‘bye’ to Akka darling

1362
01:54:19,525 --> 01:54:20,252
Bye Akka!

1363
01:54:23,673 --> 01:54:25,962
No one wants to be with me

1364
01:54:26,845 --> 01:54:29,658
If you be like this for long, you will go away from yourself

1365
01:54:34,275 --> 01:54:37,939
Are you also leaving me Darling?

1366
01:54:57,682 --> 01:54:58,416
Have something Anjali.

1367
01:55:00,228 --> 01:55:03,883
We cannot change the past, we have to change ourselves

1368
01:55:04,697 --> 01:55:08,783
The earlier you recover, the better for you

1369
01:55:27,142 --> 01:55:31,563
I cannot resist my tears. I can imagine her plight

1370
01:55:32,352 --> 01:55:37,986
We do not have words to console you Krish

1371
01:55:38,399 --> 01:55:45,775
Looks like she had revealed her past only to say ‘No’ to Krish

1372
01:55:46,471 --> 01:55:50,736
Not necessary that rejecting Krish was the reason

1373
01:55:51,307 --> 01:55:53,471
Why don’t we ask Krish himself to clarify?

1374
01:55:55,328 --> 01:55:59,328
Krish, tell us the truth. Why did she reveal her past to you?

1375
01:55:59,984 --> 01:56:02,760
Tell us Krish

1376
01:56:03,228 --> 01:56:04,088
Tell us Krish

1377
01:56:04,267 --> 01:56:04,900
Tell us Krish

1378
01:56:05,072 --> 01:56:05,767
Tell us Krish

1379
01:56:05,807 --> 01:56:06,533
Tell us Krish

1380
01:56:06,558 --> 01:56:07,307
Tell us Krish

1381
01:56:07,377 --> 01:56:07,971
Tell us Krish

1382
01:56:07,996 --> 01:56:11,414
Will you all kill him if he doesn’t tell you? He should think of something now

1383
01:56:11,899 --> 01:56:14,127
We do not have time left for the show…Please

1384
01:56:15,392 --> 01:56:16,033
Silence!

1385
01:56:16,353 --> 01:56:16,963
Silence!

1386
01:56:17,627 --> 01:56:18,799
Silence is all I get from her.

1387
01:56:19,721 --> 01:56:21,689
That is the only answer for all my questions.

1388
01:56:23,799 --> 01:56:25,205
She told me everything

1389
01:56:25,885 --> 01:56:27,103
and then it is all silence.

1390
01:56:27,867 --> 01:56:31,439
I have to find my answers in that silence…

1391
01:56:33,096 --> 01:56:35,635
We do not get what you say Krish

1392
01:56:36,109 --> 01:56:39,885
What is there to be confused about, she indirectly said ‘No’

1393
01:56:40,267 --> 01:56:43,978
When did she? When did she say that she does not like Krish?

1394
01:56:44,314 --> 01:56:46,814
What else can we infer from her silence?

1395
01:56:47,103 --> 01:56:49,025
Silence is half acceptance, may be?

1396
01:56:49,510 --> 01:56:51,486
May be it was, in the good olden days.

1397
01:56:51,861 --> 01:56:54,650
Now, silence means you go and die your death

1398
01:56:54,838 --> 01:56:55,830
Have you started it again?

1399
01:56:56,877 --> 01:56:57,494
Stop

1400
01:56:58,861 --> 01:56:59,455
Krish,

1401
01:57:00,088 --> 01:57:03,096
all of them are thinking in their point of view

1402
01:57:03,603 --> 01:57:05,822
and advising you accordingly.

1403
01:57:06,533 --> 01:57:09,674
Leave aside her silence,

1404
01:57:11,603 --> 01:57:12,791
what is your decision?

1405
01:57:24,599 --> 01:57:28,961
It is not what I decide, it is what the destiny does.

1406
01:57:30,781 --> 01:57:37,037
How did a fictitious story I told to save someone’s life turned real in my life?

1407
01:57:37,709 --> 01:57:40,295
What did she lose Prakash whom she loved immensely?

1408
01:57:42,677 --> 01:57:48,328
Why did it(destiny) get her closer to me and why is it taking her away?

1409
01:57:50,138 --> 01:57:54,141
Why did it make me so indecisive?

1410
01:58:01,342 --> 01:58:01,912
Anand,

1411
01:58:02,193 --> 01:58:02,623
Mom

1412
01:58:03,521 --> 01:58:04,201
come home

1413
01:58:05,623 --> 01:58:06,373
Ok mom

1414
01:58:23,131 --> 01:58:28,123
Are tears hindering your vision..

1415
01:58:28,506 --> 01:58:33,521
Are they darkening your world..?

1416
01:58:33,888 --> 01:58:38,927
Clueless on where to head to..

1417
01:58:39,279 --> 01:58:44,334
Is vaccum travelling along..?

1418
01:58:44,670 --> 01:58:54,531
Is the merciless time pushing you to a devastation?

1419
01:58:55,724 --> 01:59:00,490
Oh heart…Oh heart…

1420
01:59:01,183 --> 01:59:05,941
I am at your mercy now…

1421
01:59:06,566 --> 01:59:15,859
Oh heart…Oh heart…it is all because of you!

1422
01:59:38,293 --> 01:59:43,308
All the unfulfilling memories

1423
01:59:43,683 --> 01:59:49,043
Should I touch them frequently

1424
01:59:49,082 --> 01:59:54,089
The little time we were together

1425
01:59:54,464 --> 01:59:59,878
Should I treasure it for the whole life

1426
02:00:00,477 --> 02:00:05,656
Strong belief that you would never go past me…

1427
02:00:05,941 --> 02:00:11,230
Such is that love…

1428
02:00:11,324 --> 02:00:13,542
The reason why…

1429
02:00:13,972 --> 02:00:21,979
the thought of you not being here…is not any near…

1430
02:00:22,253 --> 02:00:23,855
I do understand what you say.

1431
02:00:25,355 --> 02:00:30,555
It is difficult for us to know what she has in mind,

1432
02:00:32,753 --> 02:00:35,543
it is very difficult for a person to speak in geetha's condition

1433
02:00:36,269 --> 02:00:38,847
You cannot even ask her

1434
02:00:39,543 --> 02:00:46,001
You did whatever you could and irrespective of whatever happens you

1435
02:00:46,143 --> 02:00:50,916
to be as a friend....or love her forever

1436
02:00:51,516 --> 02:00:55,511
you said what you needed to say..she will think about herself

1437
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:59,613
along with these..you have a life

1438
02:01:01,699 --> 02:01:05,305
thinking about this..don't spoil your life

1439
02:01:28,808 --> 02:01:38,940
Uttering your name in my sleep….

1440
02:01:39,621 --> 02:01:49,183
All the dreams I come across are yours!

1441
02:01:50,378 --> 02:01:55,410
All the marks on my heart did not fade away…

1442
02:01:55,792 --> 02:02:01,003
How can I get wet in a new raining love?

1443
02:02:01,183 --> 02:02:06,238
Moist eyes haven’t dried yet…

1444
02:02:06,605 --> 02:02:12,003
How can I reach a new dream destination?

1445
02:02:12,628 --> 02:02:17,886
Accept… and go away from my past..

1446
02:02:18,082 --> 02:02:23,386
Reject….and stay in my yesterday?

1447
02:02:23,488 --> 02:02:28,699
at night....leaving all the moonshine

1448
02:02:28,832 --> 02:02:35,074
shall i go towards the sunshine....

1449
02:02:58,402 --> 02:02:59,175
Dad,

1450
02:03:02,343 --> 02:03:13,234
that I had always wanted and... that i had always wanted to stay with me…
left me forever in a moment!

1451
02:03:15,082 --> 02:03:24,382
Something which I never expected
and someone who is younger to me came into my life,
and now his life is being ruined as well.

1452
02:03:28,547 --> 02:03:32,651
What kind of a life is this?

1453
02:03:37,824 --> 02:03:40,878
A human life runs itself through various phases, Geeta.

1454
02:03:42,902 --> 02:03:43,683
Dreams

1455
02:03:44,207 --> 02:03:45,152
tears,

1456
02:03:45,652 --> 02:03:47,113
unexpected happiness,

1457
02:03:47,582 --> 02:03:48,987
unforeseen sorrow,

1458
02:03:49,316 --> 02:03:53,191
unforgettable memories, unbreakable relations….

1459
02:03:53,683 --> 02:03:56,941
they all touch your heart and go…like those waves do.

1460
02:03:57,699 --> 02:04:03,414
Some hit us hard and their impact lasts longer.

1461
02:04:06,074 --> 02:04:10,410
It is important that we recover from such jolts and move ahead.

1462
02:04:11,933 --> 02:04:14,324
All you need to think now

1463
02:04:14,832 --> 02:04:19,242
is what your heart want and what kind of a future are you looking forward to.

1464
02:04:19,574 --> 02:04:22,175
Your likes and choices are the ones which would create a future for you.

1465
02:04:38,317 --> 02:04:38,824
Move…

1466
02:04:41,078 --> 02:04:44,644
Oai...Anand Krishna..move aside

1467
02:04:53,300 --> 02:04:56,113
May I know the intension behind this, Ms. Gadde Geetanjali?

1468
02:04:56,902 --> 02:05:01,292
All those who sat and studied here later became big celebrities

1469
02:05:01,582 --> 02:05:02,808
I do not understand these girls!

1470
02:05:10,222 --> 02:05:16,023
Hello Listeners, Welcome back to my show
Special guest on our show today is Geeta

1471
02:05:17,589 --> 02:05:18,050
What

1472
02:05:18,144 --> 02:05:18,964
Say Hi!

1473
02:05:21,238 --> 02:05:22,941
Hi, I am Geeta!

1474
02:05:25,425 --> 02:05:28,160
So good to see you both together,

1475
02:05:28,972 --> 02:05:33,277
feeling even better to see another couple as well

1476
02:05:33,753 --> 02:05:34,324
Who are they sir?

1477
02:05:34,574 --> 02:05:36,214
Our Seenu

1478
02:05:40,128 --> 02:05:41,105
What happened…

1479
02:05:42,019 --> 02:05:43,574
why are your faces like that?

1480
02:05:46,480 --> 02:05:47,839
Please tell me,

1481
02:05:49,089 --> 02:05:50,628
he did not even call us on the show today.

1482
02:05:51,128 --> 02:05:52,777
OMG…did he commit suicide…?

1483
02:05:52,870 --> 02:05:55,179
No sir, nothing like that…

1484
02:05:55,253 --> 02:05:55,988
but

1485
02:05:56,675 --> 02:06:00,402
What but? Don’t , please tell me what happened

1486
02:06:01,964 --> 02:06:06,862
I called up Seenu to meet him personally.
He shared his location asking me to come

1487
02:06:06,988 --> 02:06:07,519
Aaaa

1488
02:06:09,457 --> 02:06:11,191
It is the same location shown in the map.

1489
02:06:12,972 --> 02:06:13,832
I think this is

1490
02:06:15,644 --> 02:06:16,027
Brother,

1491
02:06:17,535 --> 02:06:18,832
do you know if this address here is that of Seenu?

1492
02:06:18,980 --> 02:06:23,843
I am Seenu brother, please wait for a while…I have some work

1493
02:06:27,492 --> 02:06:28,485
Oh my God!

1494
02:06:28,652 --> 02:06:31,172
Seenu : Please Come Out
Geeth : What happenend Anand? Why are you rushing?

1495
02:06:31,542 --> 02:06:32,160
Come down…

1496
02:06:32,410 --> 02:06:33,121
take a step…

1497
02:06:34,886 --> 02:06:35,597
another step

1498
02:06:35,622 --> 02:06:36,347
Tell me

1499
02:06:37,542 --> 02:06:43,617
I thought of ending my life after your rejection,
but I realized that my love for you will not die even if I do.
Why are you unable to understand that?

1500
02:06:43,824 --> 02:06:46,378
Why? Why? Why?

1501
02:06:47,152 --> 02:06:48,332
Because…I cannot you idiot!

1502
02:06:48,425 --> 02:06:51,698
Because I am married and because I have a husband as well

1503
02:06:51,793 --> 02:06:52,707
Ahhhhhhh....

1504
02:06:52,972 --> 02:06:54,675
Can’t married women and women with husbands fall in love?

1505
02:07:02,316 --> 02:07:06,347
I have seen a lot of such petty things before my marriage.

1506
02:07:09,125 --> 02:07:11,765
Why are you both still in a state of shock?

1507
02:07:11,941 --> 02:07:15,847
Is there anything left to say about him…

1508
02:07:17,152 --> 02:07:18,668
say it right away…

1509
02:07:19,339 --> 02:07:21,519
if you are in shock, don’t you see that there is a lag in the scene

1510
02:07:21,644 --> 02:07:24,222
The address we visited is that of you sir.
The lady seenu proposed is none other than your wife

1511
02:07:28,730 --> 02:07:29,628
Hello…Radio City

1512
02:07:29,964 --> 02:07:31,191
Krish came here to meet me…

1513
02:07:31,402 --> 02:07:32,574
and I could not see him after that…

1514
02:07:32,683 --> 02:07:33,738
he is not picking my calls either.

1515
02:07:33,918 --> 02:07:35,480
How can I meet him urgently?

1516
02:07:36,386 --> 02:07:42,023
How long will you take to come to Radio City 91.1 office at Aseelmetta?

1517
02:07:42,219 --> 02:07:43,500
Just 5 minutes

1518
02:07:47,168 --> 02:07:48,394
How dare you…

1519
02:07:49,113 --> 02:07:50,472
to propose my wife

1520
02:07:50,750 --> 02:07:53,828
and to call me up to come to my office itself?

1521
02:07:54,250 --> 02:07:54,883
Come…

1522
02:07:55,359 --> 02:07:55,844
Come

1523
02:07:56,016 --> 02:07:57,976
I will ensure that your generator is broken!
