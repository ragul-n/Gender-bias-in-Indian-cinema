5
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,680
How this becomes not good?

6
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,500
That is not good.

7
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,519
vergheese, is this how you do business?

8
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:07,280
Yes...

9
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,759
ls this how you do business?

10
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,560
l was patient while you kept
these aside.

11
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:12,920
What so big deal in it?

12
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,200
They are not at all  coconuts.

13
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,760
Then, are they beetle nuts?

14
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,159
Anyway, l'm not going to replace them.

15
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,360
Don't try to fool me.

16
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:28,479
There is no use talking to him.

17
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,039
No need to check again.

18
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,599
Let me see.

19
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,800
There is nothing to be surprised about it.

20
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,640
He is the son of the man who doesn't
even mind taking a coin from shit.

21
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,520
He resembles his father.

22
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:49,560
Careful! Don't abuse my father.

23
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,200
Why are you getting tensed?

24
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,000
Now dare to abuse my father again.

25
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,759
l wasn't talking to you at all.

26
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,800
Then what you said?

27
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,039
l was talking to vergheese.

28
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:02,200
But still it was about me
you were talking about.

29
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:03,599
Catch him.

30
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,319
Let them say anything.

31
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,280
Why are you getting tensed unnecessarily?

32
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:10,039
Mother, you didn't hear what he said.

33
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,439
May be he is drunk.

34
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,540
l should've chopped him into pieces.

35
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,400
Leave me.

36
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:22,200
How can he talk like that?

37
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,280
He never used to open his mouth
when your father was alive.

38
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,800
But now, look how he is talking.

39
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,480
After his father's death,
everyone has started to wag their tails.

40
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,400
He will say anything he likes.

41
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:35,000
He has the right on our land.

42
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,840
Everyone is on his side.

43
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:38,240
Landlords have none on their side.

44
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,960
Stop, don't go.
- What did he think of me?

45
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:42,240
Go inside.

46
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:49,080
l'm talking to you knowing
the current market rates.

47
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,520
It is Rs. 1 .20.

48
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,280
90 paise is your price, not mine.

49
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,920
There are totally 60 trees.

50
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:06,240
l can't tell you how much l will get.

51
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,000
May be.

52
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,560
May be few more than your count.

53
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,800
l'm not desperate to sell.

54
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:21,120
lf you accept my rate, come.

55
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,319
Orelse why waste time & money.

56
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,840
Listen, if you don't come
on the said date,

57
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,439
then there is no point in blaming me.

58
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:34,800
l'll find a another buyer.

59
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:36,959
Okay. Bye.

60
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:44,240
Don't take bath..

61
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,920
Just tally your accounts..

62
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:49,879
Let the pond cool down.
lt is still hot.

63
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,959
You never know to take bath
& keep yourself clean.

64
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:56,680
To take bath...?
Only now l came back from work.

65
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,959
That's what l'm trying to say.

66
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,500
Me too.

67
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,199
Who is that at this hour?

68
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,560
ls it Rishi?

69
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:10,560
So, you have come!

70
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,319
He is not going to take bath.

71
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:14,319
Have you got it?
- Yes.

72
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:19,000
lf we give it to him,
it is very tough to get it back.

73
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,120
Don't you know anyother guy
other than him?

74
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,800
Why to blame him?

75
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,840
How many times have you got it repaired?

76
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,079
8 or 9 times?

77
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:28,879
lt has been repaired very well.

78
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,519
Here on, it will run very smoothly.

79
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,879
lt will run for another 8 1/2 months.

80
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:36,280
Why 8 1/2?
Why not 9 months?

81
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,360
l've a doubt.
Will you tell the truth?

82
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,519
Tell me sister.

83
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,800
You take this to town to get it repaired

84
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,360
and bring it back.

85
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,600
Don't you charge for these?
- Charge means?

86
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,800
Won't you take money for it?

87
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,439
Hey...

88
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:56,759
He charges for all his expenses.

89
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,199
Rs.5 for taking it
& Rs. 6 for bringing it back.

90
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,120
Totally Rs. 1 1 for transportation.

91
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,800
What do you think of him?

92
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,360
He is very clever.

93
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,959
Just for Rs. 1 1? So sad!

94
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,400
You both gel very well.

95
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:17,040
How is your new venture?
ls it profitable?

96
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,000
lt's better we don't discuss about it.

97
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,160
Only if any bulb in a near by house get fused,

98
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,680
l'll get business.

99
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:26,240
The wires & cables which l bought
are still untouched.

100
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:27,439
lt's better they don't rust.

101
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:30,280
There is a solution for it.

102
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:32,240
l know what you do.

103
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:40,480
You sit on a chair
& ogle at the girls who pass by.

104
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:45,400
There is a little truth
in what you said.

105
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,160
l can atleast have a good view
of the girls.

106
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,400
That's why l stay there.

107
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,720
There is nothing in this village.

108
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:56,400
l'm only an ordinary guy.
You can lead a luxurious life since

109
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,519
you're the son of Thambooran.
But can l lead such a life?

110
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:04,079
l'm getting few proposals for marriage.

111
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,720
lf they ask about my job, l will tell
them that l've business in town.

112
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,879
When l live in town, l can look
after the business & ogle at girls.

113
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,120
You can only ogle at girls & nothing more.

114
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,400
From your face
I can read that.

115
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,120
Yes, it is true.

116
00:07:21,005 --> 00:07:25,005
You have to see what boys
do in town

117
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,639
They are only kids.

118
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:29,879
Why talk about town?

119
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:33,539
Do you know what all is happening here?

120
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,600
You should listen to the
experiences of little boys.

121
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,319
Those are real life experiences.

122
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,480
We'll be shocked to hear that.

123
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,920
We must also break that.

124
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,639
Go ahead. Who is stopping you?

125
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,480
Tresya Joseph lives close to your house.

126
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,879
Not possible..
-Why not possible?

127
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,160
She is now the dream girl of this village.

128
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,879
She is the cuckoo of this village.

129
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:00,800
Really?

130
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,480
All the boys of the village are after her.

131
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:09,879
She goes to town very frequently
in different A/C cars.

132
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:11,879
l've heard some rumours about her.

133
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:13,439
Since she is your neighbour,

134
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:16,079
Why not try once?
There is nothing to lose.

135
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:16,920
No.

136
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,640
l can't spoil may image in the village.

137
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:24,079
lf we lose our status
& image here, where else can we go?

138
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,600
lf we are not careful,
our image will get spoiled.

139
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,120
You will die due to constipation.

140
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,000
You too.

141
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,320
Where is Devi electricals shop?
- Go that way.

142
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:04,200
That way...?

143
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:14,200
l've found you.

144
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,680
lt was very difficult to find your shop.

145
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,399
How come you are here?

146
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,360
lt's very hot.

147
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,200
Jose, order 2 teas please.
- No tea. l've to go.

148
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,680
C'mon, you came just now.

149
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,860
That doesn't mean l've no urgent work.

150
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,360
You showroom is well decorated.

151
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,080
What brought you here?

152
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,440
l came here to buy a goat's head.

153
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:42,759
To make soup for my mother.

154
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:44,639
lt is a good cure for the pain
in the joints.

155
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,919
Unlike in village,
we get it very fresh here.

156
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:51,080
Since l've come this far,
l will buy some vegetables too.

157
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,039
The prices are very cheap.

158
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,039
But still,

159
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,680
Will you spend this much bus fair
for just this?

160
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,759
Do you believe me now?

161
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,279
Yes.
- Then, come with me.

162
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:07,599
The bike is in the workshop.

163
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,480
No need for any bike.

164
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:12,000
Jose, l'll be back soon.

165
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,519
Take it. 20...22...23.

166
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,639
This is less.

167
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,960
This is enough.
- What?

168
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,240
What l have given you is enough.

169
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,039
You've given me less.

170
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,680
l counted before giving you.

171
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:43,840
l've given you what l told you.

172
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:45,399
Wonderful!

173
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:46,680
Are you the deciding authority?

174
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:48,399
Yes, in this matter, l decide.

175
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,240
Take this too.

176
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,840
What is this?
- Why bargain for a dead goat's head?

177
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:56,399
That's what l'm telling you.

178
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,879
So do l.

179
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:06,600
very hot!

180
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:08,759
Summer has just started.

181
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,000
l can't stay in my room,
if it is too hot.

182
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,919
You are really great.

183
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:18,279
Can we have a lime juice?

184
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,360
Lime juice with salt is good during summer.

185
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,039
Yes, it is good.
But it might cost 3 rupees.

186
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:24,840
lt's okay.

187
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:28,399
What is the use in earning
if we don't spend a little?

188
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,159
Need more salt?
- Salt?

189
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:43,639
Salt doesn't cost much, right?

190
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:45,360
Got lce cubes?
- No ice.

191
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,200
What lime juice without ice cubes?

192
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:48,039
No ice cubes.

193
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,399
You should've told this before.

194
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:53,840
You should've asked me before.
- Should l?

195
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:54,759
Yes, you must.

196
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,879
They why did you put up this board?

197
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,240
What is the meaning of COOLDRlNKS?

198
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,639
lt means cool.

199
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:02,720
Okay, l'll goto school & learn.

200
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:03,440
What did you say?

201
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:05,680
No brother...
- Shut your mouth.

202
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,399
lnspite of you giving you
my hard earned money.

203
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,279
should l have to hear what ever you say?

204
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,840
Drink if you want
or else pour it down & leave.

205
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:13,399
l won't mind if you don't pay for it.

206
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,159
Who wants your charity?

207
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:17,600
l don't want your dirty lime juice.

208
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,840
You drink it yourself.

209
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,800
l'll find out a shop which gives
lime juice with ice.

210
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:22,879
Come, lets go.

211
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:28,200
Shall we go?- But where?

212
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,200
Just come with me.

213
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:35,080
Go.

214
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:43,159
Come.

215
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:44,519
Let the auto wait here.

216
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,920
We'll have a glass of fresh juice.

217
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:47,759

218

Come.

219
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,840
Hey...- Leave my hand. Come.

220
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:14,440
Nobody's here.

221
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,759
Thank god! No one here knows me.

222
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,360
Men of our age used to come here.

223
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,000
And l've caught them red handed.

224
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,200
lf anyone sees us here...
- So what?

225
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:33,519
My honour goes into this air.
- How?

226
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,159
What are you blabbering man?

227
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,440
Will you lose your honour
for drinking lime juice?

228
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,360
Come here.

229
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,440
Got ice cubes?
- For what? To cool your head?

230
00:13:43,465 --> 00:13:45,465
Got Ice?
-Yes.

231
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:50,039
2 fresh lime juice with ice
& without soda.

232
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,680
Add salt instead of sugar.

233
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:55,360
Squeeze one full lime.

234
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:59,840
Shouldn't we enjoy our life?

235
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:04,920
Enjoy? ls this the way to enjoy?

236
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,879
What you said is right?

237
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:11,440
Enjoy means we must enjoy fully.

238
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,200
Can we have a beer each?

239
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:20,560
lt's nice to have a beer
in this hot summer.

240
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:25,519
That's true. But now...here?

241
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,039

242
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,399
Yes, we have.
- 2 bottles of beer.

243
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:47,080
l was wondering what you are up to.

244
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,000
Please start having it.

245
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,519

No. very rarely.

247
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,720
Who is that?

248
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,639
You again landed ?

249
00:16:10,004 --> 00:16:12,004

6 beers please.

253
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:22,480
Stop staring at us.

254
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,159
You drink.

255
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,480
Mr. George, what's the hot news?

256
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,920
Nothing hot.

257
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:35,560
l was watching him performing
a new play.

258
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:40,560
Come here.

259
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,879
How are you?

260
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,360
ls it your bag?
What's in it?

261
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,759
vegetables...

262
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,600
There is goat's head in it.

263
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,840
Keep it down.

264
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,240
Look, he is Babu.

265
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,079
3 of his buses run in our place.

266
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,680
Devamadha...

267
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,319
Yes, Devamadha.

268
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:10,759
He is the owner of Devamadha.

269
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,960
His family owns totally 1 7 buses.

270
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:17,519
Babu, he is Rishi into electrical business.

271
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,240
Electrical business?
What business is that?

272
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:26,039
Where?
- ln the market. Devi Electricals.

273
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,039
Devi Electricals...?

274
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,960
Electricity to Devi (Goddess)?

275
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:38,880
He is my friend.
He lives near my house.

276
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,279
Don't rag him.- Okay.

277
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,880
Lets not waste time.
Lets party.

278
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
How did you escape from the party?

279
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,360
That's a very big story.

280
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,079
We didn't drink the lime juice.

281
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,240
Don't pay for it.

282
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:04,079
Never pay for the bills.
- Sit here.

283
00:19:08,004 --> 00:19:12,004
Thangal, what's your next programme?
- As you said.

284
00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:17,029
Can we break his ..............?

285
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:23,160
l'm going there only.
You bring him there.- Okay.

286
00:19:26,085 --> 00:19:28,085
We came in an autorikshaw,
I remember very well...

287
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,120
Bye David.

288
00:19:35,045 --> 00:19:37,045
One autorikshaw...

289
00:19:45,079 --> 00:19:46,160
What's happening?

290
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,920
Even your intestines might come out.

291
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:55,240
What's this?
Can you keep quiet for a while?

292
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,920
lt's enough.

293
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:03,600
What's all this?

294
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:05,759
Enough.

295
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,400
Make no noise. Take it.

296
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:12,720
Lime juice...
- We didn't pay for the lime juice.

297
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,319
Stop it.

298
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:22,720
l'll beat you.
Stop it.

299
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,160
l think the boy in the counter
is from our place.

300
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:39,880
Let him be.

301
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,160
What bothers me?

302
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,559
Will he cause me some trouble
in the hotel?

303
00:20:46,759 --> 00:20:48,600
No trouble.

304
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:54,279
Because we have booked the entire floor.

305
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,720
lf any problem crops up,
l'll buy this hotel.

306
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:01,640
Want to see that happen? Come.

307
00:21:05,065 --> 00:21:08,065
Keep quite and come...
Hold this..

308
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Enjoyment is inside...

309
00:21:28,025 --> 00:21:32,025
You told me about your desire,
didn't you?

310
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:41,050
You get in.

311
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:25,880
Do you recognize her?
Tresia Jose.

312
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,440
She is from our village.

313
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,640
Are you going to say you don't know me?

314
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,759
l know you.

315
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,799
You both don't have any problem,
do you?

316
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:56,000
You are leaving, right?
- Yes.

317
00:23:56,319 --> 00:23:57,079
l knew it.

318
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,559
lf l stay here, this play will continue.

319
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,160
Don't stay here.

320
00:24:00,759 --> 00:24:03,039
Will you be here?
- Yes. You can leave.

321
00:24:03,559 --> 00:24:06,480
He is my friend.
- l'll take care of him.

322
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,640
Bye.

323
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:46,559
lt's only a child's play to him.

324
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,160
When compared to his other activities,
these are nothing.

325
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,400
Did he leave last night itself?

326
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:57,079
ln your town, people hate him
for being so stingy.

327
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:00,720
Which of the two is true?

328
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:01,959
To him, everything means fun.

329
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:04,160
You can stay here till 12 O'clock.

330
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,759
No, l'll move now.

331
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:15,799
What you told me about him is true, ah?

332
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,799
Yes, whatever l told you about him is true.

333
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,680
Why should l lie to you about him?

334
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:24,480
You said he never slept
with any girl till now.

335
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:25,600
As far as l know, he never did.

336
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,000
He does such things for his friends.

337
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,079
l understood.

338
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,319
Does he have lot of friends in this town?

339
00:25:33,559 --> 00:25:34,240
l didn't know.

340
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:38,360
He lived here for more than 4 yrs.

341
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:41,279
He used to be a hero
when he was in college.

342
00:25:41,799 --> 00:25:44,600
He had spent most of his father's earnings.

343
00:25:45,079 --> 00:25:48,400
He never needs any money
to do anything in this town.

344
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,360
How is that possible?

345
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:50,240
Yes, it is possible.

346
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,799
Everyone knows about him.

347
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,279
He personally comes
& pays the dues within a week.

348
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,120
That his secret.

349
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,879
And he'll leave without anyone's knowledge.

350
00:26:02,104 --> 00:26:04,104
He is more trustworthy than a bank.

351
00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:13,480
So, hotels, bars, taxis
offer their free service to him.

352
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,640
lf l tell this to the villagers,
they will beat me.

353
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,000
Why do you want to tell them unnecessarily?

354
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:22,079
l told you all this because he told me
to tell you if you ask about him.

355
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:42,279
We should have brought aunty with us.

356
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,079
All the 9 houses are in different continents.

357
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:46,200
My mother knows.

358
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,279
That's why she sent us.

359
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,680
She sent us to wander around the village.

360
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,039
Somebody is coming this way.

362
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,160
Stop staring at them. Do your work.

00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,079
Where is Mannarthodi's house?

364
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,400
Mannarthodi...?

365
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,200
What's the matter?

366
00:27:34,099 --> 00:27:35,820
Where are you coming from?

367
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,400
From town.- l knew it.

368
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:42,640

Sapthathi means 70th birthday, right?

387
00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:45,039
You don't look like 70 yr. old women?

388
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:45,840
Not us.

389
00:28:46,039 --> 00:28:48,160
lt is for our Great grandmother.
- Whose great grandmother?

390
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:51,799
Ours. She is Radha, my cousin.

391
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,360
My father's sister's daughter.

That means my mother's brother,
Baskar uncle.

00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,600
So she is from Thiruvarpathu...?

So, you have also come here before.

00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,279
Yes. But long back.

412
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:55,000
Wow! You've grown up very fast.

413
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,799
When you came here before,
you were very bony.

414
00:29:58,079 --> 00:30:03,079
While coming this way,
you sit on Madhavan cycle's hand bar

415
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:07,440
and you used to look like
a little lizard.

416
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,480
Are you not coming with us
to your house?- l'll try.

417
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:15,799
Go straight & you'll end up
in our garden.

418
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:17,840
From there, you can see our house.

419
00:30:18,039 --> 00:30:18,880
Go straight.

420
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,360
What did you say your name is?

421
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,680
Radha.- Yes, Radha.

422
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:36,799
When you meet anyone,
try to give some respect.

423
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:48,200
What is this?
- He is very uncultured.

424
00:31:09,079 --> 00:31:11,519
l told her that l like her.

425
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:15,279
You could've told me when she was here.

426
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,400
What would've happened?

427
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,880
l would've enquired about
that girl with Ranjini.

428
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:23,400
Why beat around the bush?

429
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,720
l myself would've told her.

430
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,440
Will she pounce on me if l tell her?

431
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,920
How can we talk about this to girls
of this generation?

432
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:33,079
lf we take this proposal to them,
they'll surely accept it.

433
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,680
lt isn't because you're smart.

434
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,400
lt's because you are the
son of Justice Thambooran.

435
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,559
Or else no intelligent
& modern girl will ever marry you.

436
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,360
l'll throw this on you.

437
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:23,600
Now the bell will ring.

438
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,120
Everyone will go to their classes.

439
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:27,120
We'll have to wait here
for another 1 1/2 hr.

440
00:32:27,319 --> 00:32:29,640
l'll make her come out the class.

441
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,840
What do you think of me?
This is our college.

442
00:32:33,079 --> 00:32:35,120
We had spent 4 yrs. studying here.

443
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:40,360
Do you know l made this college principal
drink his first peg of liquor?

444
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:41,920
Actually, he was my professor.

445
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,440
Go. But beware of boys.

446
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,480
What boys!

447
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,440
l came in search of you.
Please come.

448
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:26,759
Come l say.

449
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:38,960
l would like to marry you.
Do you have any objection?

450
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,759
lf you've any problem, just tell me now.

451
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,319
l feel disturbed. That's why l came here.

452
00:33:46,519 --> 00:33:51,880
Since when are you disturbed?
- From the moment l saw you.

453
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,279
lt's better you change yourself.

454
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:04,759
l'm very serious.
You don't have to reply right away.

455
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:08,880
l couldn't stop myself saying this to you.
That's why l came here.

456
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,039
Why did you come to college
early morning?

457
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:19,000
l'm not here to create any problem.

458
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,079
You don't have to reply to me.

459
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:24,159
Malini sister or Ranjini will talk to you.

460
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,639
Tell your decision to them.

461
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,720
Till then, let this disturbance continue.

462
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:29,920
l like it.

463
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:33,599
l've nothing to say
to Malini sister or Ranjini.

464
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:34,880
l tell you my decision right now.

465
00:34:35,079 --> 00:34:36,280
l don't like you.

466
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,920
l've heard a lot about you.

467
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:44,920
After seeing you, l realized that
you're more than what l heard about you.

468
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,920
You want to be disturbed, right?

469
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:49,880
But please relieve me out of it.

470
00:34:58,039 --> 00:35:04,599
Who is he? What is he to you? Shall we deal with him?

471
00:35:11,639 --> 00:35:16,119
Radha had ''Moolakuru'' problem in the morning.

472
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:20,960
l mean Piles.

473
00:35:21,159 --> 00:35:24,679
Her mother sent me to know how she is.

474
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:27,679
When l spoke to her,
it busted.

475
00:35:28,039 --> 00:35:28,960
She is hot because of that.

476
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:31,519
Don't worry my dear.
lt will pain for a while.

477
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,679
You don't have to worry about that.

478
00:35:33,079 --> 00:35:34,440
Now, go to your class.

479
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:20,079
Met her?
- l couldn't meet her.

480
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:21,880
l told you, didn't l?

481
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,559
What should we do now?

482
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,880
Lets go.- Then...?

483
00:36:27,639 --> 00:36:31,800
We'll have lime juice.

484
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:39,400
Lime juice? Now?

485
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,559
Did it happen like that?

486
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:03,000
lf she tells this to her family,
everyone will know this.

487
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,920
l don't care about that.

488
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,800
lt's not that.

489
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,960
Only now l realise how foolish l was.

490
00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:16,400
Why did I control myself till this age ?

491
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,360
Why should l?

492
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,240
She said she doesn't like me.

493
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:25,880
l like her & everyone woman in this city.

494
00:37:26,039 --> 00:37:28,360
Now you'll see who l am.

495
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,320
Drink & leave quickly.

496
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,960
There will be problem
if you stay.

497
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,440
You've a bus now.

498
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,880
Or else l'll take you in my scooter.

499
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:40,559
Don't stay in this town
with your disturbed mind.

500
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,119
No need.

501
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:56,119
Thangal,
Please sit.

502
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:10,320
How did you know that l was here?

503
00:38:10,519 --> 00:38:14,720
To be frank,
l would've phoned your home in 2 days.

504
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,720
I wanted to see you.
-What?

505
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:18,880
Nothing.

506
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,599
lt is to discuss some personal matter.

507
00:38:22,119 --> 00:38:24,039
Okay, l'll move. You continue.

508
00:38:24,639 --> 00:38:26,280
l've some work in my shop.

509
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:32,320
Better don't create new problems.

510
00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:36,039
Don't even offer him a drop of liquor.

511
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,679
He is very upset.

512
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,200
Really...?
- He is joking.

513
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,039
Bye.

514
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,440
What is so personal you want to discuss?

515
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,920
A small favour.

516
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,880
Favour...?
For you? From me?

517
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,360
Tell me what it is.

518
00:38:57,599 --> 00:38:58,880
There is something.

519
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:02,639
We'll talk about it having a beer?
- No.

520
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:06,519
It should not be discussed with drinks.

521
00:39:07,039 --> 00:39:10,920
l thought of coming to your house
& discuss it.

522
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,200
What is so serious about it?

523
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,800
lt's about bringing a new girl
into this profession.

524
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:25,559
We've our own place.
Lets go there & talk.

525
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:29,240
lf we stay here,
unnecessary thoughts will disturb us.

526
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,599
That will create problems,

527
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,880
which in turn makes things more difficult.
Come..

528
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,159
l think this is the address.
Read it.

529
00:39:47,159 --> 00:39:48,599
Clara.- Yes.

530
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:52,159
Who is this Clara?

531
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,159
ls she into this profession?

532
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,480
lf she is in this profession,
why would l disturb you?

533
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,840
She wanted to come to this profession
through me.

534
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:03,659
What for?
- For livelihood, what else?

535
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:08,035
She wanted to get out of
that house in a nice way.

536
00:40:08,036 --> 00:40:12,079
l & her step mother made a plan for that.

537
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:14,200
That's why l'm giving you this address.

538
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:19,200
What should we do with this address?

539
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,840
We have to write a letter to this address,

540
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:24,360
as if Mother Superior
of a church around here.

541
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:26,200
Should l write the letter?

542
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:29,480
l came for your help
because l'm an illeterate.

543
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,599
What should Mother Superior write?

544
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,119
l'll tell you.

545
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,320
But before that,
you must know who she is,

546
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:39,760
who are her relatives & more.

547
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,559
When did you first see her?

548
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,519
l met her in this town a year back,

549
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:49,559
in a group which had come for an excursion.

550
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,639
l noticed her then.

551
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,960
l saw her last week.

552
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:00,800
Just because l'm old, no one suspects me.

553
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,639
That's how l met her.
- Then what?

554
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,800
Her mother is dead. She lives with her father.

555
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:07,880
And her qualification?
- She had failed in her pre-degree.

556
00:41:08,159 --> 00:41:09,480
Her father is a drunkard.

557
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:13,720
Because of that,
she has financial problems at home.

558
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,200
She has a step-mother.

559
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:18,159
Her step-mother's children
are her only relatives.

560
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:20,639
Have you been to her house?- Yes.

561
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:23,400
l met her step-mother.
- Then...?

562
00:41:23,679 --> 00:41:26,840
She was expecting a person like me.

563
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:32,119
She had planned to bring Clara
to this profession long back.

564
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,800
First get Clara
join the christian missionary.

565
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,119
We got her father's permission too.

566
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:42,440
This letter is to convince him and
her uncle.

567
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:43,599
Letter from the missionary.

568
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,159
On seeing the letter,
she will come out.

569
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,800
We shouldn't go there for some days.

570
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,039
l had promised her step mother
that l'll give the letter.

571
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:52,400
l don't know how to write
like a mother superior.

572
00:41:52,639 --> 00:41:55,840
lt is just a formality.
lt'll be fine.

573
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:58,519
But still, we do need their letter head,
don't we?

574
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,119
That's not a matter of concern.

575
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:02,280
lf nothing works out,
we'll print one.

576
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,159
l'll come tomorrow morning with all these.

577
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:08,440
You be ready with the contents.

578
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,079
As that boy said, go home
& don't drink any lime juice.

579
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:42,000
''May god bless you''

580
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:45,240
To dear Clara,

581
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:28,480
l was very happy to read your letters.

582
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:37,280
By god's grace, l'm happy to inform you that
you've been selected to serve god.

583
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:44,800
You & your step-mother
must come to the missionary on 23rd.

584
00:43:56,559 --> 00:44:02,079
Your step-mother can stay here
for a couple of days.

585
00:44:10,679 --> 00:44:16,320
We feel very happy on your growth.

586
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:29,960
While coming, bring snacks to eat.

587
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Clara...

588
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:07,440
You shouldn't have been
so rude to him.

589
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:10,280
What else can l do?
There is a limit to everything.

590
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,440
He is both stingy & shameless.

591
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,599
Since l was so rude to him,
he won't disturb me anymore.

592
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:19,360
After his visit to college,
boys have something to talk about.

593
00:46:19,559 --> 00:46:21,679
Now boys have given me a nick name.
- Nick name?

594
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:24,400
lt has started.
- What do they call you?

595
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:27,480
Really?

596
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:29,880
Shit!

597
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:40,559
Did Jaikrishnan of Mannarthuudi
met you in college?

598
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:42,559
Yes. How did you know that?

599
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:44,519
Brother of a girl studying there told me.

600
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,760
So, that has become the hot news, ah?

601
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,079
Radha, come inside.

602
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:52,920
l wonder what else is going
to happen. Rogue!

603
00:46:57,679 --> 00:46:58,800
When l told him to get lost,

604
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:03,679
he started to blabber like a lunatic.
That's all.

605
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:06,039
He must be knowing
that you are my sister.

606
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,200
He knows & he even told me.

607
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:15,240
lf he approches you again,
inform me.

608
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:19,159
Approch? He won't come near me.

609
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:21,679
He got very nicely from me.

610
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:25,360
He must be after someother girl by now.

611
00:47:25,559 --> 00:47:28,599
No. You must be careful at this point.

612
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:32,320
l know him for many years.

613
00:47:32,519 --> 00:47:35,480
l can narrate you 100 different stories
about him.

614
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:41,679
But this is first time
Jayakrishnan has approched a girl.

615
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:43,280
The first time.

616
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:48,559
l think, since you had been very rude
to him, he must have felt hurt.

617
00:47:49,559 --> 00:47:54,400
Not even his close friends
can predict his next move.

618
00:47:54,599 --> 00:47:58,400
Once he takes a decision,
he never steps back.

619
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:01,960
He has people to do anything
for him in this town.

620
00:48:02,159 --> 00:48:02,880
Do you know that?

621
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:04,880
That's why l'm telling you,

622
00:48:05,079 --> 00:48:08,280
if he approaches you at anytime,
inform me.

623
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:09,280
Got it?

624
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:11,519
Now you can go.

625
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:58,720
l don't recognize you.

626
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:02,880
Mannarkudi Jayakrishnan...
- This is his house.

627
00:49:03,079 --> 00:49:05,200
He is inside. l'll call him.

628
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:06,519
Please sit inside.

629
00:49:07,159 --> 00:49:10,599
Where are you coming from?
- Actually...

630
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:13,200
l haven't seen you before.

631
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:16,159
l come here very rarely.

632
00:49:16,519 --> 00:49:18,431
Master.....

633
00:49:23,432 --> 00:49:26,159
how come you are here?

634
00:49:26,679 --> 00:49:28,039
Mother, don't you know Kurukkal master?

635
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:29,800
He was my teacher
when l was in 5th class.

636
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,240
Kurukkal master.

637
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,519
lt's been very long since we met.

638
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,559
How did you remember me now?

639
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:37,800
Please sit inside. Come.

640
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:51,320
Sit...please sit.

641
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:57,519
What would you like to have?
Coffee or horlicks?

642
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:59,039
No thanks.

643
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:02,880
No way. You must have something.

644
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:06,720
Tea. You don't drink tea, do you?

645
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,039
very good memory.

646
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:09,360
The same old kid.

647
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,200
He is stubborn even now.

648
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:18,079
We can give him a lime juice.

649
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:19,639
ls that enough?

650
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:21,119
Yes, that's enough.

651
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,920
Would you like to have tender coconut?

652
00:50:24,119 --> 00:50:25,960
No. Lime juice is enough.

653
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:34,599
The girl has come.- Who?

654
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:35,599
Clara.

655
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:47,079
Mother, do you have oats?- Yes.

656
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:50,920
Mix it with banana & bring it.

657
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:52,760
Master is very hungry.

658
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:55,039
He felt little shy to tell you.

659
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:57,559
Till then,
l'll show him our house & lands.

660
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:04,280
She is with her step-mother.

661
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,360
You must also do me another favour.

662
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:10,840
You must find out what's in her heart.

663
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:12,480
How can l?

664
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:17,840
l came for your help because
l don't trust anyone else.

665
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:20,840
lf l could get her,

666
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:24,400
my business will go on even
if l don't have other girls.

667
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:25,800
She'll also be profited.

668
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:28,440
very huge profits.

669
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:33,159
But we have find out whether
she will stay with me.

670
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:36,720
Don't you know how to keep girls
under your custody?

671
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:39,360
l think it is difficult in her case.

672
00:51:39,559 --> 00:51:41,599
What do you want me to do?

673
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:43,280
Nothing much.

674
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:44,960
Come with me to town.

675
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,119
lf possible,
stay for a couple of days.

676
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:49,800
Tell your mom that l've a problem
to be solved & come with me.

677
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
You must find out what's in her heart.

678
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:53,639
What do you mean?

679
00:51:53,840 --> 00:52:00,119
l want to know whether if someone
offers her a bungalow & a car,

680
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:03,000
will she accept that offer
& go with him?

681
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:06,880
Ideal job for me !!!

682
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:24,159
What contractor?
- Punnoose contractor.

683
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:25,519
Don't change the name.

684
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:27,200
Punnoose contractor.

685
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:42,639
Please get inside.

686
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:52,639
This is the best suit available.

687
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:53,840
Please sit.

688
00:52:56,519 --> 00:52:58,240
Punnoose contractor,
didn't l tell you?

689
00:52:58,440 --> 00:52:59,400
Yes...

690
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:01,159
Where is she?

691
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:08,360
There she is.

692
00:53:13,519 --> 00:53:15,920
Punnoose contractor.
A big timber merchant.

693
00:53:18,639 --> 00:53:20,480
Please sit.- No, l like to stand.

694
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:25,639
Please come here.
- Come & sit here.

695
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:32,880
Shall l order for soda?

696
00:53:32,905 --> 00:53:34,905
Yes.

697
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:42,320
What's it?

698
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:48,400
l've seen people drinking in the evenings,
but you....

699
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:51,320
lt is funny to her.

700
00:53:51,519 --> 00:53:55,079
She thinks l'm talking
about her drunkard father.

701
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,519
What's your name?

702
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:01,639
My real name is Glory.

703
00:54:01,664 --> 00:54:05,664
But everyone including her father
calls me Beatrice.

704
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:08,680
Since everyone call me that way,
it has become my name.

705
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:12,680
Now, l like that name.

706
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:23,039
They will bring soda in a moment.

707
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:23,800
The brief...

708
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:27,320
Are you going to be here
till the soda comes?

709
00:54:27,519 --> 00:54:29,360
Oh! No way.

710
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:48,280
That's 310. This is 31 1 .

711
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:51,039
lf you need anything, just call.

712
00:54:52,119 --> 00:54:54,280
Your daughter is very lucky.

713
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:58,119
One should fall in the
right hands to come up in life.

714
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:00,480
Who do you think he is?
- ls he very rich?

715
00:55:01,159 --> 00:55:03,639
lf he likes her, he'll treat her like a queen.

716
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:05,280
lt's true.

717
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:11,000
l'll meet you later.

718
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:20,960
Why haven't you fallen in love till now?

719
00:55:21,039 --> 00:55:22,240
lt isn't true, is it?

720
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:24,200
Why should l lie to you?

721
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:26,400
So, you never felt like falling in love.

722
00:55:26,599 --> 00:55:29,680
What is the reason?
- How do l know?

723
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:33,079
The men l met aren't qualified for that.

724
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:35,559
Am l qualified?

725
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,240
What is the use of it?

726
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,280
You've a wife & children.

727
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:42,840
What should l ruin your happy family life?

728
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:49,240
l will ask you something.
Will you tell me the truth?

729
00:55:50,119 --> 00:55:51,000
Go ahead.

730
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:55,519
ls it your own decision?
- Yes.

731
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:57,079
What is the reason?

732
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:02,920
I didn't ask you the reason
for coming here?

733
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:03,920
Did I ?

734
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:06,159
No.

735
00:59:39,039 --> 00:59:41,400
You had this before, right?

736
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:11,119
l didn't expect that.

737
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:15,800
l expected something different.

738
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:40,639
From the day l knew,
it is quarrel everyday.

739
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:43,519
l was fed up with my life.
So...

740
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:46,559
Quarrel with whom? ls it Beatrice?

741
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:48,669
l used to quarrel much with her frequently.

742
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:50,840
She fights with me for every reason.

743
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:52,720
First she used to beat me.

744
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:56,440
When l lost control,
l slapped her once.

745
01:00:57,079 --> 01:00:59,240
After that incident,
we fight everyday.

746
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,480
And l started winning.

747
01:01:02,039 --> 01:01:06,240
lf l have to live in that house,
l must chose this profession.

748
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:09,200
They themselves are finding ways
to push me in to this profession.

749
01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:14,040
Do you want to be saved from getting ruined?

750
01:01:14,599 --> 01:01:15,920
Anyway, l will get ruined.

751
01:01:16,039 --> 01:01:18,000
Then I can get ruined in a prestigous way.

752
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:22,199
And l can die after fulfulling
all my desires, right?

753
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:49,200
l think you didn't open the briefcase.

754
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,079
Here is what you told me to buy.

755
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:54,240
l don't know whether
this is what you asked for.

756
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:03,360
Just a second.

757
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:22,960
Are you telling the truth?
- Yes.

758
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:27,000
She hadn't been touched
by a man till now.

759
01:02:29,025 --> 01:02:31,025
She was a virgin, I know.

760
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:33,480
Even I didn't expect that.

761
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:36,840
May be she was waiting for you.

762
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:41,920
l should'nt have done that.

763
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:46,039
You must rather feel lucky.

764
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:48,159
Forget it.

765
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:50,920
Did you find out what's in her mind?

766
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,639
Were you not able to find out
or was she very stubborn?

767
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:55,360
l never asked.

768
01:02:56,119 --> 01:02:59,519
And she is not easily understandble.

769
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:00,960
l knew that.

770
01:03:01,159 --> 01:03:03,200
That's why l sought your help.

771
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,119
l don't think I can do that.

772
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:13,119
Everygirl coming to this profession
has a soft story.

773
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:16,720
l'll lose before her.

774
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:18,240
Everything will be alright.

775
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:19,960
First you open the briefcase.

776
01:03:20,159 --> 01:03:22,360
The mood will change. Come.

777
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:27,360
l forgot to ask you.

778
01:03:28,159 --> 01:03:31,079
We know each other
for more than 5 yrs, right?

779
01:03:31,079 --> 01:03:31,800
Yes.

780
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:33,800
There are lot many stories between us.

781
01:03:35,119 --> 01:03:38,599
You used to trap others
in such situations.

782
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:41,240
But in this, you got trapped, right?

783
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:47,400
Like her,
is this the first time for you too?

784
01:03:52,039 --> 01:03:52,680
Yes.

785
01:04:07,039 --> 01:04:12,800
l'll get you a beautiful bungalow.

786
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:17,240
A bungalow costing Rs. 7 - 8.

787
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:20,519
Rs. 8 means, a cartboard house?

788
01:04:21,519 --> 01:04:26,400
Rs. 8 means 8 lacs.

789
01:04:31,159 --> 01:04:39,039
Grinder, mixie, Tv...
a fully furnished house.

790
01:04:40,599 --> 01:04:45,119
And a Maruthi...
a green coloured one.

791
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:48,760
To girls like you,
Maruthi is the best.

792
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:50,119
Maruthi is enough.

793
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:52,079
Will you teach me how to drive?

794
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:53,711
Sure..

795
01:04:54,012 --> 01:04:57,379
Are you making fun of me?
- No.

796
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:02,079
You didn't have a drop of liquor.

797
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:07,920
You made me drink a bottle of whisky
and enjoying?

798
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:11,960
Dear, are you enjoying?

799
01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:19,320
You don't have to enjoy that way.

800
01:05:19,519 --> 01:05:21,440
Lets go to the beach

801
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:22,599
Beach?

802
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:26,000
Beach behind this coconut groove.

803
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:27,639
A beautiful beach.

804
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:30,400
l don't want to go.
Don't be crazy.

805
01:05:30,599 --> 01:05:33,480
Breathing fresh air
in the beach means crazy to you?

806
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:36,039
In the evenings, it is ok.

807
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:38,160
But at night, it is crazy.

808
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:40,119
ls this the law?- Yes.

809
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:43,960
Lets break that law.
Come.

810
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:48,360
Why are you rubbing against me?

811
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:54,840
Everyone here know you, right?
- Yes.

812
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:57,440
What would the hotel men think about you?

813
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Who cares what they think about us?

814
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:02,519
Now, l'm going to buy this hotel.

815
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:05,119
Want to see that?

816
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:09,240
What hotel is this!?

817
01:06:09,519 --> 01:06:12,079
Full of steps.

818
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:28,480
Why are repeating the same thing?

819
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:33,400
Because you didn't give me perfect reply.

820
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:37,559
l don't want to be your keep.

821
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:39,639
ls that enough?

822
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:46,280
What's the reason?
- Reason.....

823
01:06:46,300 --> 01:06:49,851
I know that there are many people waiting
to make me their keep.

824
01:06:50,079 --> 01:06:54,320
Let me count the number of people
who wants me.

825
01:06:58,559 --> 01:06:59,800
Even if l wish to,

826
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,240
Why should I become
a timber contractor's keep?

827
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:06,519
l can rather search for richer customer, right?

828
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:17,440
very greedy.
- What did you say? Come again

829
01:07:19,079 --> 01:07:21,760
very greedy!

830
01:07:45,519 --> 01:07:48,720
O timber merchant!

831
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:54,760
Who are you? Tell me the truth.

832
01:07:58,639 --> 01:08:06,000
l know whatever you said from morning
till now are lies.

833
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:10,280
Even knowing that,
l told you the truth about me.

834
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:14,200
But we both can to be united.

835
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:18,000
lf you tell me the truth,
it'll be useful for both of us.

836
01:08:19,319 --> 01:08:20,279
Tell me the truth.

837
01:08:20,440 --> 01:08:21,520
Everything will come good.

838
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:34,199
It was me...
It was me...

839
01:08:37,079 --> 01:08:41,560
It was me... mother superior.

840
01:08:45,119 --> 01:08:46,239
l guessed.

841
01:09:22,279 --> 01:09:29,159
lf Radha wasn't rude to me,
l wouldn't have met Clara.

842
01:09:31,319 --> 01:09:36,399
l might have met you,
but not this way.

843
01:09:39,079 --> 01:09:43,039
l had controlled myself all these years
without losing to any woman.

844
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:52,840
Was to give myself
to a woman l liked.

845
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:59,720
From now on,
l'm afraid that l may try everyone.

846
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:01,880
Nothing like that.

847
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:04,159
You meet Radha once more.

848
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:09,199
Not in the college.
But somewhere else.

849
01:10:09,224 --> 01:10:11,224
No way....

850
01:10:13,239 --> 01:10:14,199
She will come.

851
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:19,199
One day she will in Mannarthodi.

852
01:10:21,279 --> 01:10:23,640
With 3-4 children just like you.

853
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:28,800
And l will come to see that.

854
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:40,280
Some admance... some believes.... some bad habbits..

855
01:10:40,300 --> 01:10:42,380
l'm a mixture of all these.

856
01:10:43,319 --> 01:10:44,159
l knew it.

857
01:10:44,399 --> 01:10:48,720
And today,
Clara broke my stubborness.

858
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:57,119
l never wanted to be the firstman
to spoil a girl's life.

859
01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:04,720
l never wanted to take away
a girl's virginity.

860
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:13,640
lf that happens, l had taken a vow
to make her my life partner.

861
01:11:20,199 --> 01:11:24,239
Shall I marry you, Clara?

862
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:34,279
You don't have any problem,
do you?

863
01:11:36,079 --> 01:11:36,760
No.

864
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:42,159
But you have to join us (joins our cast).

865
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:44,560
What do you mean?
- To go into the sea.

866
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:46,600
We'll go.

867
01:11:47,319 --> 01:11:48,359
lt's not enough if you go.

868
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:51,319
While coming back,
there should be something in the net.

869
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:54,039
ls it enough if you have anything
in the net?

870
01:11:54,159 --> 01:11:54,960
No...

871
01:11:55,159 --> 01:11:55,920
Then...?

872
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:59,279
l want the boat full of...

873
01:12:50,471 --> 01:12:52,271
The clouds get denser.

874
01:12:52,471 --> 01:12:54,431
The desires start to pour.

875
01:13:08,311 --> 01:13:10,431
With whom we begin ourjourney,

876
01:13:10,630 --> 01:13:17,191
with whom we share our pain,

877
01:13:17,431 --> 01:13:19,071
with whom we share our life,

878
01:13:19,271 --> 01:13:26,231
we never know.

879
01:14:10,951 --> 01:14:19,830
You made me forget the heat of
this summer. You're my destiny.

880
01:14:24,991 --> 01:14:33,431
You made me forget the heat of
this summer. You're my destiny.

881
01:14:33,951 --> 01:14:37,670
The dreams start to sprout
on a new relationship,

882
01:14:37,911 --> 01:14:41,311
and bloom there on.

883
01:14:41,511 --> 01:14:50,471
lt then grows & becomes a big jungle.

884
01:14:50,670 --> 01:14:52,750
The clouds get denser,

885
01:14:52,951 --> 01:14:54,951
the desires start to pour,

886
01:14:55,151 --> 01:14:58,991
and l hear a new melody in my heart.

887
01:15:40,151 --> 01:15:44,351
As the sea becomes rough,

888
01:15:44,550 --> 01:15:48,870
the pearls shine.

889
01:15:53,590 --> 01:15:57,790
As the sea becomes rough,

890
01:15:58,031 --> 01:16:02,271
the pearls shine.

891
01:16:06,911 --> 01:16:10,071
lt's an ever lasting melody

892
01:16:10,271 --> 01:16:19,391
which gives birth to a new tune.

893
01:16:19,590 --> 01:16:21,550
The clouds get denser.

894
01:16:21,750 --> 01:16:23,790
The desires start to pour.

895
01:16:23,991 --> 01:16:27,951
and l hear a new melody in my heart.

896
01:16:28,590 --> 01:16:30,590
With whom we begin ourjourney,

897
01:16:30,790 --> 01:16:32,790
with whom we share our pain,

898
01:16:33,031 --> 01:16:34,750
with whom we share our life,

899
01:16:34,951 --> 01:16:41,550
we never know.

900
01:16:41,750 --> 01:16:43,670
The clouds get denser.

901
01:16:43,870 --> 01:16:45,870
The desires start to pour.

902
01:16:46,111 --> 01:16:50,590
and l hear a new melody in my heart.

903
01:18:25,151 --> 01:18:26,630
Do you remember what l said?

904
01:18:27,670 --> 01:18:29,870
l didn't say that because
l was in a romantic mood.

905
01:18:30,071 --> 01:18:30,951
You know, right?

906
01:18:34,391 --> 01:18:36,870
l'll be back soon.
l'm not going anywhere.

907
01:18:45,951 --> 01:18:49,191
l advice you not to take
any hasty decision.

908
01:18:49,550 --> 01:18:51,630
She will only see you for
next few days.

909
01:18:51,630 --> 01:18:55,191
Not for just few days. 
Forever...

910
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:01,000
For the first time, l fell in love with a girl.
She left me.

911
01:19:01,271 --> 01:19:03,151
l made love with another girl.

912
01:19:03,630 --> 01:19:08,231
And if she also leaves....,
l will ruin myself.

913
01:19:10,750 --> 01:19:13,031
l know myself better than you do.

914
01:19:15,951 --> 01:19:20,071
l treat you as my elder brother.

915
01:19:20,951 --> 01:19:23,231
Don't try to make business out of her.

916
01:19:23,550 --> 01:19:25,870
l'll bear all your loses.

917
01:19:26,951 --> 01:19:29,231
She will come to Mannarthudi.

918
01:19:30,271 --> 01:19:35,031
Talk to her step-mother
& take a proper decision and do help me.

919
01:19:35,911 --> 01:19:41,031
Be as my elder brother
& help us in getting married.

920
01:19:57,710 --> 01:19:58,710
What is it, Andappa?

921
01:19:58,870 --> 01:20:01,710
A boy from the hotel came
& asked you to go there immediately.

922
01:20:01,830 --> 01:20:02,630
Has it been raided?

923
01:20:02,911 --> 01:20:05,031
Not raid. But something else.

924
01:20:05,271 --> 01:20:07,271
That lady is creating problems.

925
01:20:08,991 --> 01:20:10,550
You came in taxi, right?- Yes.

926
01:20:11,790 --> 01:20:13,951
You don't have to come.
- No, l will.

927
01:20:17,391 --> 01:20:21,391
My daughter left without informing me.

928
01:20:21,590 --> 01:20:23,431
Don't shout like this.

929
01:20:23,630 --> 01:20:25,071
Oh my daughter...

930
01:20:25,271 --> 01:20:26,870
Where did she go?
- Who knows?

931
01:20:27,071 --> 01:20:28,550
When l came & saw, she wasn't here.

932
01:20:28,790 --> 01:20:31,391
He says that she left a while ago.

933
01:20:31,630 --> 01:20:34,431
l saw my daughter only yesterday.

934
01:20:34,630 --> 01:20:36,071
l never saw her after that.

935
01:20:36,311 --> 01:20:37,830
You must find my daughter
& bring her back to me.

936
01:20:38,071 --> 01:20:39,630
l brought my daughter to you.

937
01:20:39,790 --> 01:20:41,071
Don't shout.
- l will shout.

938
01:20:41,311 --> 01:20:44,511
Let the police come
& find out where you've hidden my daughter.

939
01:20:46,790 --> 01:20:49,271
l say don't talk.

940
01:21:09,550 --> 01:21:11,391
Damodaran, tell me what really happened?

941
01:21:11,590 --> 01:21:13,550
She escaped from this place.

942
01:21:13,750 --> 01:21:16,311
Did you see her leaving?
- Yes, l saw.

943
01:21:16,511 --> 01:21:18,191
That's why l'm able to tell you.

944
01:21:18,391 --> 01:21:20,511
She left after 30 mins. after you left.

945
01:21:20,830 --> 01:21:23,670
We thought you both had
come to an understanding.

946
01:21:24,590 --> 01:21:26,670
Where might she had gone?

947
01:21:28,231 --> 01:21:29,590
She might have gone somewhere.

948
01:21:29,790 --> 01:21:31,911
She asked for train timings before leaving.

949
01:21:32,111 --> 01:21:32,951
The manager told me.

950
01:21:33,151 --> 01:21:34,111
When is the train?

951
01:21:34,311 --> 01:21:35,351
The trains would have left early morning.

952
01:21:35,550 --> 01:21:36,951
She left on that time.

953
01:21:37,151 --> 01:21:38,311
Are you telling the truth?

954
01:21:38,511 --> 01:21:40,231
l can say this in any court.

955
01:21:40,431 --> 01:21:41,550
ls that enough?

956
01:21:41,870 --> 01:21:46,471
O lord! Hope she is safe.

957
01:21:47,911 --> 01:21:49,391
Come with me. l've to talk to you.

958
01:21:49,710 --> 01:21:50,991
Shall l search in the railway station?

959
01:21:51,191 --> 01:21:53,311
You go & search.
But l don't think we can find her.

960
01:21:53,550 --> 01:21:56,071
She is very clever.
l knew that.

961
01:24:40,630 --> 01:24:46,071
He didn't say a word about this to me.

962
01:24:46,271 --> 01:24:48,191
He might have felt shy.

963
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:51,501
The other day,
he told me that he likes Radha.

964
01:24:51,590 --> 01:24:54,391
But l never expected this.

965
01:24:54,630 --> 01:24:56,431
Mad! He could've have told me.

966
01:24:56,630 --> 01:24:59,471
Did he ever enquire about Radha
after that incident?

967
01:24:59,630 --> 01:25:01,670
He & his busy schedule!

968
01:25:01,870 --> 01:25:04,670
He is busy with farming, coconut business

969
01:25:04,870 --> 01:25:06,351
and sometimes goes to Guruvayoor temple.

970
01:25:06,550 --> 01:25:08,031
He would've forgetton that long back.

971
01:25:08,231 --> 01:25:10,111
But she is directly opposite to him.

972
01:25:10,311 --> 01:25:11,790
You mean Radha?
- Yes.

973
01:25:11,991 --> 01:25:13,951
She had some assumption about him.

974
01:25:14,151 --> 01:25:15,991
Only she knows what it is.

975
01:25:16,191 --> 01:25:20,191
After that incidient,
l & Madhavan told her a lot about Jaikrishnan.

976
01:25:20,391 --> 01:25:22,710
Anyway, she feels guilty.

977
01:25:22,911 --> 01:25:24,870
She thinks she shouldn't
have been so rude to him.

978
01:25:25,431 --> 01:25:27,830
She planned to talk to him today, 
if he comes.

979
01:25:28,031 --> 01:25:30,031
When he didn't turn up,
she felt bad.

980
01:25:30,471 --> 01:25:32,151
What should l do now?

981
01:25:32,511 --> 01:25:33,830
Do one thing.

982
01:25:34,071 --> 01:25:36,710
Talk to him & send us his horoscope.

983
01:25:36,911 --> 01:25:38,870
lf the horoscopes match,
l'll take care of the rest.

984
01:25:39,111 --> 01:25:41,191
Baskaran uncle is so adamant on such things.

985
01:25:41,391 --> 01:25:43,151
You know him, right?
That is the reason.

986
01:25:49,951 --> 01:25:52,391
l don't want to give my horoscope to anyone.

987
01:25:53,670 --> 01:25:55,311
l don't want to get married in that way.

988
01:25:55,511 --> 01:25:58,670
This is an usual custom.
Let them go ahead.

989
01:25:58,870 --> 01:26:02,391
Or else, we'll get her horoscope.
- I said no...

990
01:26:02,416 --> 01:26:05,916
If they are ready without checking horoscope match,
this marriage will happen.

991
01:26:06,271 --> 01:26:08,630
Tell them that l said this.

992
01:26:09,590 --> 01:26:11,911
What does she think of herself?

993
01:26:12,071 --> 01:26:14,750
After doing all such nonsense .....

994
01:26:16,271 --> 01:26:18,431
What are you doing, Jaikrishnan?

995
01:26:20,271 --> 01:26:24,271
After she said she doesn't like you,
you had lime juice in front of me.

996
01:26:25,111 --> 01:26:26,391
l saw your plight.

997
01:26:27,790 --> 01:26:32,750
Now she likes you, why are you
creating unnecessary problems?

998
01:26:34,071 --> 01:26:35,191
What's your problem?

999
01:26:37,630 --> 01:26:39,351
l've no problem.

1000
01:26:41,471 --> 01:26:43,951
To fall in love....

1001
01:26:44,710 --> 01:26:46,031
and express love to her....

1002
01:26:46,951 --> 01:26:49,790
And she would either accept 
or reject it.

1003
01:26:50,311 --> 01:26:52,111
These things happens in everyone's life.

1004
01:26:52,670 --> 01:26:53,911
l know that.

1005
01:26:54,750 --> 01:26:57,151
lt should've happened at the age of 20.

1006
01:26:58,710 --> 01:27:00,550
Those are lost golden moments.

1007
01:27:01,710 --> 01:27:06,031
Being the son of Justice Thambooran,
l had no freedom.

1008
01:27:06,231 --> 01:27:07,710
No freedom to fall in love too.

1009
01:27:10,550 --> 01:27:16,710
lf the girl we like rejects our love,
then it is a shame.

1010
01:27:17,710 --> 01:27:19,590
But now she likes you.

1011
01:27:20,311 --> 01:27:23,471
No Rishi. Now she is not in my mind.

1012
01:27:24,271 --> 01:27:28,830
lf our horoscopes don't match,
it will again cause pain.

1013
01:27:30,431 --> 01:27:32,590
Why get disturbed unnecessarily?

1014
01:27:35,191 --> 01:27:36,511
So, I am in trouble.

1015
01:27:36,710 --> 01:27:39,231
Even she says she doesn't want to
match horoscopes.

1016
01:27:41,630 --> 01:27:44,590
Only you must tell this to Jaikrishnan.

1017
01:27:44,991 --> 01:27:47,630
Then l am in trouble, not you.

1018
01:27:49,670 --> 01:27:51,271
Why is she so stubborn all of a sudden?

1019
01:27:51,471 --> 01:27:53,431
The main reason is you.

1020
01:27:54,111 --> 01:27:54,750
Don't stare.

1021
01:27:54,951 --> 01:27:58,231
lt was you who created a good image
about him in her mind.

1022
01:27:58,431 --> 01:27:59,471
What did l say?

1023
01:27:59,670 --> 01:28:02,111
You told that he has an 
underworld connections.

1024
01:28:02,311 --> 01:28:03,550
And he can do anything.

1025
01:28:03,750 --> 01:28:06,151
l thought he would create
some problems.

1026
01:28:06,351 --> 01:28:09,271
When she knew that
he didn't create any problem,

1027
01:28:09,471 --> 01:28:11,511
she started to gather information
about him.

1028
01:28:11,710 --> 01:28:15,550
From friends, college staff
& from me.

1029
01:28:16,071 --> 01:28:18,630
Bus owner Babu's neice
is her classmate.

1030
01:28:18,870 --> 01:28:21,391
When enquired about him, many stories were unfolded.

1031
01:28:21,500 --> 01:28:22,100
Night trips,

1032
01:28:22,111 --> 01:28:24,031
going elsewhere
rather than going to Guruvayoor.

1033
01:28:24,231 --> 01:28:24,951
very lavish,

1034
01:28:25,151 --> 01:28:26,670
making people fall in traps.

1035
01:28:26,911 --> 01:28:30,071
When she found that Jaikrishnan
is different from what he is,

1036
01:28:30,271 --> 01:28:31,630
she got curious.

1037
01:28:32,111 --> 01:28:35,550
She says Jaikrishnan is neither of these.

1038
01:28:35,750 --> 01:28:36,830
What happened to her?

1039
01:28:37,031 --> 01:28:40,991
Jaikrishnan does not want to marry her
after horoscope match, right?

1040
01:28:41,191 --> 01:28:45,991
And this statement has made
him a hero to her.

1041
01:28:46,111 --> 01:28:48,311
Even if he agrees,

1042
01:28:48,511 --> 01:28:52,670
l wonder how l'm going to
convince my father.

1043
01:28:58,870 --> 01:29:01,830
Relative's marriage or any marriage..

1044
01:29:02,031 --> 01:29:04,830
my father checks the horoscopes match secretly.

1045
01:29:05,031 --> 01:29:09,750
l told her.
But nothing bothers her.

1046
01:29:09,951 --> 01:29:16,511
l did a foolish thing by going
to college on that day. But...

1047
01:29:16,710 --> 01:29:18,111
No need to tell me.

1048
01:29:19,271 --> 01:29:21,111
l know you from college days.

1049
01:29:21,311 --> 01:29:23,590
Though you know many girls,

1050
01:29:23,830 --> 01:29:27,431
I am sure that this will be your first love.

1051
01:29:27,670 --> 01:29:28,951
l told this to Radha too.

1052
01:29:29,471 --> 01:29:36,471
My mood at that time
& my mental distress now...

1053
01:29:36,670 --> 01:29:39,271
Do onething.
Talk to her directly.

1054
01:29:39,471 --> 01:29:42,511
That's good rather than beating around the bush.

1055
01:29:42,750 --> 01:29:45,951
Come home & talk to her.
- l can't.

1056
01:29:46,191 --> 01:29:49,311
After all this,
l can't even think about that.

1057
01:29:49,710 --> 01:29:50,790
Then, how?

1058
01:29:52,071 --> 01:29:53,550
On every Tuesdays & Fridays,

1059
01:29:53,750 --> 01:29:56,311
she goes to vadakumnathan temple,
early morning.

1060
01:29:56,750 --> 01:30:00,271
Believe in god atleast for a day.

1061
01:30:08,911 --> 01:30:17,351
l came to college & expressed my love,
because of my extreme affection to you.

1062
01:30:18,191 --> 01:30:22,590
l thought of giving you a surprise
& win your heart.

1063
01:30:22,600 --> 01:30:24,640
Thats what happened.

1064
01:30:25,191 --> 01:30:28,630
That's why l started liking you.

1065
01:30:29,790 --> 01:30:30,670
But...

1066
01:30:32,550 --> 01:30:35,111
On that day, l had the right to
express my love to you.

1067
01:30:36,231 --> 01:30:40,670
lf l had seen a fraction of affection
towards me in your eyes,

1068
01:30:40,870 --> 01:30:47,790
l would've taken you to a registrar's
office & married you.

1069
01:30:47,815 --> 01:30:50,815
Then I was totally free,
I was prepared.

1070
01:30:52,710 --> 01:30:56,550
At that time, you were the
only one in my heart.

1071
01:30:57,790 --> 01:31:00,351
But now, it is not the same.

1072
01:31:01,231 --> 01:31:05,111
You told me to remain disturbed, didn't you?

1073
01:31:06,071 --> 01:31:09,951
lt has happened as you said.

1074
01:31:10,670 --> 01:31:11,231
Who is that?

1075
01:31:11,431 --> 01:31:18,471
She came from nowhere
& vanished into thin air.

1076
01:31:18,830 --> 01:31:21,911
Don't know where she went?
- No.

1077
01:31:22,590 --> 01:31:26,231
Then, let her go.
- lt's not like that.

1078
01:31:27,311 --> 01:31:32,790
She came to this town because l wrote a letter to her.

1079
01:31:34,151 --> 01:31:38,790
And l spoiled her.

1080
01:31:40,031 --> 01:31:42,830
l became the reason
for her to take a wrong path.

1081
01:31:43,471 --> 01:31:47,151
All my stubborness
& arrogance has vanished into thin air.

1082
01:31:49,710 --> 01:31:56,511
l think that we were bonded
by god in some birth.

1083
01:31:57,550 --> 01:32:01,151
Or else, it wouldn't have be
possible to lose myselft to her?

1084
01:32:02,590 --> 01:32:03,630
l still remember,

1085
01:32:04,951 --> 01:32:09,191
When l wrote the letter to her, it was raining.

1086
01:32:10,311 --> 01:32:13,750
Again when we met, it was raining.

1087
01:32:16,710 --> 01:32:19,191
what's her name?- Clara.

1088
01:32:33,071 --> 01:32:34,550
What happened to Beatrice?

1089
01:32:35,471 --> 01:32:39,311
Thangalam & Andappan
gave her some money & sent her away.

1090
01:32:40,031 --> 01:32:41,431
She would've told the villagers,

1091
01:32:41,630 --> 01:32:44,071
that clara has joined the missionary.

1092
01:32:46,031 --> 01:32:51,311
lf Clara had accepted,
wouldn't you have married her?

1093
01:32:52,710 --> 01:32:57,111
l swear by the Sun,
l would've married her.

1094
01:33:00,471 --> 01:33:04,550
Then, why did she go away? Poor girl!

1095
01:33:05,590 --> 01:33:08,750
Even you didn't understand me first, right?

1096
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
Agreed.

1097
01:33:12,030 --> 01:33:14,790
Both of you said ''NO'' to me.

1098
01:33:15,030 --> 01:33:17,070
But there was only one difference.

1099
01:33:17,550 --> 01:33:23,031
When you said ''NO'',
there is a family to back you up.

1100
01:33:23,391 --> 01:33:26,271
But she had none.

1101
01:33:27,311 --> 01:33:32,830
And she had gone somewhere
not knowing where she is heading to.

1102
01:33:33,550 --> 01:33:35,550
But after thinking for a while,

1103
01:33:35,550 --> 01:33:37,710
l understood that she didn't
go away from me,

1104
01:33:38,550 --> 01:33:42,031
but it was from her life and
from her step-mother,

1105
01:33:42,231 --> 01:33:44,231
and from the clutches of the Thangal.

1106
01:33:44,391 --> 01:33:49,111
l praise her for her brilliance
l accept her move.

1107
01:33:50,111 --> 01:33:53,431
But Clara will come back.

1108
01:33:54,191 --> 01:33:57,511
l think she will come back for me.

1109
01:33:58,151 --> 01:33:59,391
Why do you think so?

1110
01:33:59,511 --> 01:34:02,031
Just an intuition.

1111
01:34:03,471 --> 01:34:06,191
My such intuitions hasn't gone wrong till now.

1112
01:34:06,391 --> 01:34:07,630
lf she comes...

1113
01:34:08,951 --> 01:34:10,431
l don't think she will come.

1114
01:34:10,750 --> 01:34:11,550
What if she comes...?

1115
01:34:11,750 --> 01:34:13,830
lf she comes...?
- lf she comes...?

1116
01:34:16,550 --> 01:34:18,710
Even l'm not sure what l should do.

1117
01:34:18,911 --> 01:34:22,271
lf you meet Clara now,
she'll not be the same old Clara.

1118
01:34:22,471 --> 01:34:24,710
l know it will not be like that.

1119
01:34:24,911 --> 01:34:28,111
lf you get fixed to it,
you'll not see Clara anymore.

1120
01:34:28,670 --> 01:34:30,670
And you will never see her.

1121
01:34:31,111 --> 01:34:34,511
ls it true?- Yes, it is.
You will see for yourself.

1122
01:34:39,471 --> 01:34:44,911
l know why you are taking me to backwaters.

1123
01:34:45,151 --> 01:34:48,151
Try your tricks with someone else
& not with me.

1124
01:34:48,391 --> 01:34:49,710
Why are you shouting?

1125
01:34:49,911 --> 01:34:51,550
l only asked you to see that place.

1126
01:34:51,750 --> 01:34:53,511
l can see that place only if l'm interested.

1127
01:34:53,710 --> 01:34:55,670
You decide after seeing that.

1128
01:34:56,071 --> 01:34:58,431
Go & see. Buy it only if you like it.

1129
01:34:58,630 --> 01:34:59,951
l don't want to see anything.

1130
01:35:00,151 --> 01:35:01,630
l'm not interested to see that place.

1131
01:35:01,870 --> 01:35:05,511
Do you want me & my children
get washed away in the floods?

1132
01:35:05,710 --> 01:35:06,471
lt will never happen.

1133
01:35:06,670 --> 01:35:08,511
What kind of a person are you?

1134
01:35:08,710 --> 01:35:11,311
Are you trying to hurt me?

1135
01:35:12,031 --> 01:35:14,511
lf anyone desires to chase me out,

1136
01:35:14,600 --> 01:35:17,720
the desire will remain a desire.

1137
01:35:19,071 --> 01:35:20,471
What is the matter? Enough.

1138
01:35:20,670 --> 01:35:21,991
Nothing.

1139
01:35:22,191 --> 01:35:24,511
l want to show him the
land near the backwater.

1140
01:35:24,710 --> 01:35:25,790
Why should l see the land?

1141
01:35:26,031 --> 01:35:28,311
Am l a surveyor to see the land?

1142
01:35:28,511 --> 01:35:31,151
lf you like that land, l can dump you there.

1143
01:35:31,351 --> 01:35:34,191
That's what l'm telling you.
l don't want to get dumped.

1144
01:35:35,870 --> 01:35:39,311
Since l'm poor,
you think you can do anything.

1145
01:35:39,511 --> 01:35:40,870
lt is very sad.

1146
01:35:41,111 --> 01:35:43,590
lf you are ready to throw me
in the backwaters in broad daylight,

1147
01:35:43,790 --> 01:35:45,830
what happened to law & order
in this country?

1148
01:35:45,991 --> 01:35:49,830
lf you shout anymore,
l'll throw you into the sea.

1149
01:35:52,151 --> 01:35:54,830
Where is my sickle?

1150
01:35:58,351 --> 01:36:02,191
Why do you want to talk to him?
- Leave me.

1151
01:36:12,550 --> 01:36:18,191
Father, don't kill us.

1152
01:36:19,391 --> 01:36:20,710
l'll kill everyone.

1153
01:36:20,911 --> 01:36:25,351
l'll kill everyone here itself.

1154
01:36:25,511 --> 01:36:26,710
Get inside.

1155
01:36:27,151 --> 01:36:29,231
l'll make Mannarthudi a cemetry.

1156
01:36:29,431 --> 01:36:31,431
Stop shouting.

1157
01:36:31,590 --> 01:36:33,391
Do onething.

1158
01:36:33,590 --> 01:36:36,391
Take this & kill everyone of us.

1159
01:36:36,590 --> 01:36:38,191
Kill me...

1160
01:36:38,431 --> 01:36:41,031
Why are you behaving like an idiot?

1161
01:36:41,271 --> 01:36:42,271
Come.- Kill me.

1162
01:36:43,031 --> 01:36:43,911
Lets go.

1163
01:36:44,071 --> 01:36:46,071
l've been living in this village all these years.

1164
01:36:47,151 --> 01:36:50,111
l won't leave this place.

1165
01:36:50,311 --> 01:36:53,471
You can't make that happen.

1166
01:37:29,550 --> 01:37:31,830
l sang the first raga,

1167
01:37:32,031 --> 01:37:34,431
l search for the one & only you.

1168
01:37:34,630 --> 01:37:39,391

Our eyes chanting the hymns,

1183
01:39:10,670 --> 01:39:12,951
our silence singing the devotional songs.

1184
01:39:13,191 --> 01:39:17,790
We can see all these in this holy place.

1185
01:39:17,991 --> 01:39:20,311

1186
01:39:20,511 --> 01:39:22,790

O dove! Even god is your ardent lover.

1191
01:40:07,351 --> 01:40:12,071
The long nights go hand in hand with the sleep.

1192
01:40:12,271 --> 01:40:17,511
The doors of the temple inside my heart are open.

1193
01:40:26,870 --> 01:40:31,550
The long nights go hand in hand with the sleep.

1194
01:40:31,830 --> 01:40:36,630
The doors of the temple inside my heart are open.

1195
01:40:36,830 --> 01:40:38,870
The girl you were the other day

1196
01:40:39,071 --> 01:40:41,351
and the girl you are today are totally different.

1197
01:40:41,431 --> 01:40:46,111

O dove! Even god is your ardent lover.

What are you doing?

1205
01:41:42,431 --> 01:41:45,191
Go there & dig.

1206
01:41:58,111 --> 01:41:59,351
Someone is coming.

1207
01:42:12,590 --> 01:42:14,951
A telegram.- ls it for me?- Yes.

1208
01:42:25,271 --> 01:42:27,550
Meet my mother & go.- Okay.

1209
01:42:28,191 --> 01:42:30,231
Why is it raining off season?

1210
01:43:49,710 --> 01:43:51,191
See her if you want to.

1211
01:43:51,391 --> 01:43:52,830
Or else don't see her.

1212
01:43:53,031 --> 01:43:56,111
This is exam time for Radha.
Don't tell this to her & upset her.

1213
01:43:58,151 --> 01:44:00,830
When is the train arriving?
- 3:30 am.

1214
01:44:01,031 --> 01:44:02,391
lt will be very cold.

1215
01:44:03,111 --> 01:44:06,590
Anyway l will go.
She would be expecting me.

1216
01:44:06,911 --> 01:44:09,750
Else Why should she remember only me?

1217
01:44:10,191 --> 01:44:14,750
She might be having a busy schedule.

1218
01:44:14,991 --> 01:44:17,231
You got early morning slot.

1219
01:44:17,590 --> 01:44:18,750
Let it be.

1220
01:44:18,951 --> 01:44:21,391
She has allocated me time
in the early morning.

1221
01:44:22,031 --> 01:44:24,031
She would expect me in the station.

1222
01:44:24,100 --> 01:44:26,940
l have to be there at that time.

1223
01:46:10,391 --> 01:46:13,511
What is it?
Why are you staring at me? (In Telugu)

1224
01:46:17,311 --> 01:46:20,351
Men don't allow us to walk freely
even during ealry mornings. (In Telugu)

1225
01:46:20,750 --> 01:46:23,630
When will you learn
as how to behave with a girl? (In Telugu)

1226
01:46:23,750 --> 01:46:26,231
Don't you have mother, sister?
(In Telugu)

1227
01:46:26,431 --> 01:46:28,750
This country is becomig
worse day by day. (In Telugu)

1228
01:46:38,271 --> 01:46:41,630
Last week, i was in Andhra.

1229
01:46:42,750 --> 01:46:46,271
l was Jamuna Rani
who knew only Telugu.

1230
01:46:47,911 --> 01:46:50,670
This was only a continuation of it.
Now, it will become alright.

1231
01:46:51,471 --> 01:46:53,911
Did you get my telegram?
- What question is that?

1232
01:46:54,471 --> 01:46:55,550
Without getting telegram,

1233
01:46:55,750 --> 01:46:57,750
why would l be waiting
on this platform at this hour?

1234
01:46:57,951 --> 01:47:02,231
You always sleep here, right?

1235
01:47:02,871 --> 01:47:04,710
Stop talking & take my bag.

1236
01:47:08,710 --> 01:47:14,191
Where are we going now?
You tell me where to go.

1237
01:47:15,550 --> 01:47:17,991
We're not going anywhere.
We are only going for a walk.

1238
01:47:18,191 --> 01:47:21,071
At this hour?
- Yes. We are two.

1239
01:47:23,951 --> 01:47:25,431
l love to walk.

1240
01:47:25,710 --> 01:47:29,590
Because l'm fed up living
between four walls.

1241
01:47:30,630 --> 01:47:32,311
Lets walk, contractor.

1242
01:47:32,511 --> 01:47:34,191
Lets walk till dawn.

1243
01:48:27,191 --> 01:48:30,391
Where is he taking
her to at this hour?

1244
01:48:30,871 --> 01:48:35,550
She makes my dick stiff.

1245
01:48:36,191 --> 01:48:39,830
Do the villagers have license
to talk like this at midnight?

1246
01:48:40,031 --> 01:48:41,351
Forget it.

1247
01:48:41,590 --> 01:48:44,911
lf anyone wants to take me,
let them take.

1248
01:48:45,111 --> 01:48:47,750
Lets walk.
- Shall l hire a taxi?

1249
01:48:47,951 --> 01:48:50,750
No need. Just walk.

1250
01:49:02,670 --> 01:49:06,191
While joining the missionary,
l took a photo.

1251
01:49:06,391 --> 01:49:08,031
To send it home.
Want to see that?

1252
01:49:08,550 --> 01:49:09,351
lt looks funny.

1253
01:49:18,391 --> 01:49:21,630
How do l look?- very good.

1254
01:49:22,031 --> 01:49:27,031
A very suitable attire
for beautiful girls like you.

1255
01:49:27,271 --> 01:49:30,191
You mean to say this
is best suitable dress for me.

1256
01:49:30,391 --> 01:49:34,231
lf not this, you will look beautiful
without any clothes.

1257
01:50:05,431 --> 01:50:07,031
Can we find a place,

1258
01:50:07,231 --> 01:50:09,511
where we can stay not like prisoners.

1259
01:50:09,710 --> 01:50:10,351
That....

1260
01:50:10,550 --> 01:50:15,191
House with a small verandah 
& a soothing breeze.

1261
01:50:17,391 --> 01:50:19,111
l can't stay in rooms anymore.

1262
01:50:19,951 --> 01:50:23,071
Earlier as l hated my life,
now l hate rooms.

1263
01:50:23,311 --> 01:50:25,590
Walls! Walls everywhere.

1264
01:50:25,790 --> 01:50:28,670
The walls of bedroom, sideroom & bathroom.

1265
01:50:28,871 --> 01:50:30,431
Walls everywhere.

1266
01:50:30,630 --> 01:50:31,391
After that,

1267
01:50:31,590 --> 01:50:34,991
Walls in the moving cars & trains.

1268
01:50:36,151 --> 01:50:39,790
l need to ask my friends
for any vacant house.

1269
01:50:39,871 --> 01:50:41,351
We don't need much facility.

1270
01:50:41,550 --> 01:50:44,511
l want to see the sky, day & night.

1271
01:50:44,710 --> 01:50:45,670
That's enogh.

1272
01:50:46,590 --> 01:50:50,471
There is a house, but will Clara come?

1273
01:50:51,391 --> 01:50:57,431
Nobody lives there.
But it is Thangal's house.

1274
01:50:58,151 --> 01:50:59,431
You remember Thangal, don't you?

1275
01:51:02,750 --> 01:51:07,471
Okay, lets go there.
But is better we don't see him.

1276
01:51:08,351 --> 01:51:13,991
Are you scared?
- No. But l'm not interested to see him.

1277
01:51:14,271 --> 01:51:17,151
l can't face him because
l had cheated him.

1278
01:51:41,871 --> 01:51:42,911
He is inside.

1279
01:51:44,151 --> 01:51:45,830
Park the car. l'll be back soon.

1280
01:52:12,031 --> 01:52:14,830
Taxi driver knows the place.

1281
01:52:15,071 --> 01:52:18,191
There is no facility.
because nobody lives there.

1282
01:52:18,351 --> 01:52:19,271
lt's okay.

1283
01:52:19,431 --> 01:52:21,031
lf you need anything...

1284
01:52:21,231 --> 01:52:22,271
A boy living below will come.

1285
01:52:22,511 --> 01:52:24,670
He'll get you anything you need.

1286
01:52:25,311 --> 01:52:27,191
Will you stay there for a couple of days?

1287
01:52:27,750 --> 01:52:28,750
l don't know.

1288
01:52:30,511 --> 01:52:31,710
The girl...

1289
01:52:33,151 --> 01:52:34,391
Did she enquire about me?

1290
01:52:36,231 --> 01:52:37,991
She doesn't want to see you.

1291
01:52:39,550 --> 01:52:41,630
She is waiting in the car.

1292
01:52:43,710 --> 01:52:45,391
No need to see me.

1293
01:52:57,911 --> 01:52:58,991
Wonderful!

1294
01:53:00,111 --> 01:53:03,431
l should've come here
on that day itself.

1295
01:53:03,590 --> 01:53:07,890
l ran away from this place.

1296
01:53:07,991 --> 01:53:11,550
But today, l begged for the key.

1297
01:53:15,830 --> 01:53:17,871
What's that noise?
l heard that earlier too.

1298
01:53:18,071 --> 01:53:19,431
A mad man's cry!

1299
01:53:21,911 --> 01:53:25,351
A mad man lives near by.

1300
01:53:26,151 --> 01:53:27,951
He has been chained for many days.

1301
01:53:28,431 --> 01:53:33,431
The boy said, since the mad man was
chained, his legs got bruised.

1302
01:53:33,511 --> 01:53:37,111
When the chains brush the wound,
he cires in pain.

1303
01:53:44,231 --> 01:53:46,871
l like to be the mad man's wound.

1304
01:53:47,351 --> 01:53:53,710
A wound which have contact only with that chain.

1305
01:54:03,111 --> 01:54:06,511
Why did you tell her about me?
There wasn't any need.

1306
01:54:06,830 --> 01:54:10,511
l had only our story to tell her.
So l did.

1307
01:54:10,750 --> 01:54:11,830
Should not have told her.

1308
01:54:12,031 --> 01:54:14,031
lt would've created an
unwanted disturbance to her.

1309
01:54:15,311 --> 01:54:21,231
Radha is afraid of only one girl.
And that's you.

1310
01:54:25,151 --> 01:54:28,830
lf l knew this, l wouldn't have come here.

1311
01:54:29,750 --> 01:54:30,511
Yes.

1312
01:54:47,231 --> 01:54:48,191
Over here.

1313
01:54:55,191 --> 01:54:57,351
lt will be cold by now.

1314
01:55:01,710 --> 01:55:05,710
How is it?
- A bit cold but too spicy.

1315
01:55:05,911 --> 01:55:09,911
lt's very far.
lt takes time to come here.

1316
01:55:10,111 --> 01:55:12,271
so, it will get cold.

1317
01:55:18,951 --> 01:55:20,031
l'll leave.

1318
01:55:32,630 --> 01:55:33,991
l always remember you,

1319
01:55:34,670 --> 01:55:36,630
whenever l see a new face.

1320
01:55:37,871 --> 01:55:41,071
The number of faces keep growing, right?

1321
01:55:42,231 --> 01:55:45,871
As the numbers increase,
one day you will forget mine.

1322
01:55:47,471 --> 01:55:49,151
Will I forget?

1323
01:55:49,630 --> 01:55:51,991
Yes, you will.

1324
01:56:03,151 --> 01:56:05,670
But l don't want to forget.

1325
01:56:20,590 --> 01:56:22,911
While coming, l thought,

1326
01:56:23,670 --> 01:56:29,590
if you propose to marry me,
what should l do?

1327
01:56:35,111 --> 01:56:38,710
But l knew that such a question
will not be raised again.

1328
01:56:40,590 --> 01:56:42,670
If I have asked?

1329
01:56:43,670 --> 01:56:45,670
You didn't ask, right?

1330
01:56:49,830 --> 01:56:51,830
I don't know whether you noticed...

1331
01:56:51,951 --> 01:56:55,911
We spoke a lot about Radha this time.

1332
01:56:58,710 --> 01:56:59,910
lt's good.

1333
01:57:04,271 --> 01:57:11,231
One must be lucky to marry
their first love.

1334
01:57:12,191 --> 01:57:14,511
Only good people will get such a chance.

1335
01:57:17,231 --> 01:57:22,750
Whom did Clara love at first sight?

1336
01:57:25,391 --> 01:57:26,710
lt is the contractor.

1337
01:57:28,231 --> 01:57:31,590
The first & the last.

1338
01:57:39,431 --> 01:57:42,630
Who is he?
- A marwadi boy.

1339
01:57:43,031 --> 01:57:46,790
When l met him for the first time,
he forced me to marry him.

1340
01:57:47,111 --> 01:57:48,111
Just like us.

1341
01:57:48,911 --> 01:57:49,830
What?

1342
01:57:49,871 --> 01:57:56,071
The boy brought his parents,
but l ran away from there.

1343
01:57:56,790 --> 01:58:02,750
Who is he having offices in all the states?

1344
01:58:06,590 --> 01:58:09,391
ls he a Malayalee?
- Yes. From Muvatupuzha.

1345
01:58:09,590 --> 01:58:12,351
But he got settled in Hyderabad long back.

1346
01:58:14,231 --> 01:58:16,991
Regular friend?
- l can't say like that.

1347
01:58:17,590 --> 01:58:20,231
But he too wants to marry me now.

1348
01:58:21,351 --> 01:58:23,391
ls he a Bachelor play boy?- No.

1349
01:58:23,416 --> 01:58:26,416
His wife died in an accident.

1350
01:58:27,710 --> 01:58:29,670
ls he an old man?

1351
01:58:32,005 --> 01:58:39,005
Hey Kid... you contractor....
Why are you asking such unnecessary questions?

1352
01:58:52,231 --> 01:58:54,231
I was just thinking....

1353
01:58:55,511 --> 01:58:57,710
It didn't rain this time, as we met.

1354
01:58:58,830 --> 01:59:03,830
Which means we won't meet again, right?

1355
01:59:04,055 --> 01:59:06,055
No...

1356
01:59:06,670 --> 01:59:10,871
Why should we meet again?
- l don't know.

1357
01:59:11,231 --> 01:59:15,790
But don't leave me saying
that we'll not meet again.

1358
01:59:18,431 --> 01:59:21,471
My visit shouldn't be a
trouble to Radha.

1359
01:59:23,630 --> 01:59:26,911
No. - Radha shouldn't know
about our meeting.

1360
01:59:27,500 --> 01:59:28,219
No, she won't.

1361
01:59:28,511 --> 01:59:31,911
Lets not get seperated saying
that we'll not meet again.

1362
01:59:32,191 --> 01:59:34,710
But someday we will have to part ways.

1363
01:59:34,911 --> 01:59:35,991
How do you know that?

1364
01:59:36,871 --> 01:59:37,830
l know.

1365
01:59:38,311 --> 01:59:44,710
Only till Radha comes to Mannarthudi,
you can meet me.

1366
02:00:02,550 --> 02:00:05,191
Shall l go now, Mr. Contractor?

1367
02:00:58,790 --> 02:01:08,590
In this period, nasty desires, happiness
& a couple of girls came in my life.

1368
02:01:10,111 --> 02:01:13,151
There l stood as myself.

1369
02:01:14,191 --> 02:01:16,911
But l know, if Clara comes into my life...

1370
02:01:17,111 --> 02:01:18,871
What if Clara comes...?

1371
02:01:19,111 --> 02:01:20,151
She came & went away.

1372
02:01:20,630 --> 02:01:21,351
She is gone.

1373
02:01:21,951 --> 02:01:23,451
She won't come back again.

1374
02:01:23,550 --> 02:01:25,951
Even if she comes, please don't meet her.

1375
02:01:28,071 --> 02:01:28,991
will you go?

1376
02:01:30,590 --> 02:01:31,511
You won't go.

1377
02:01:33,670 --> 02:01:37,351
l...

1378
02:01:37,550 --> 02:01:40,431
Promise me that you won't meet her again.

1379
02:01:42,471 --> 02:01:42,951
l...

1380
02:01:43,151 --> 02:01:46,031
Promise me now
& you can break that without my knowledge.

1381
02:01:47,191 --> 02:01:49,031
What is the use then?

1382
02:01:49,231 --> 02:01:50,991
There is use,
Promise me.

1383
02:01:54,191 --> 02:01:55,311
l promise.

1384
02:01:55,750 --> 02:01:58,471
Even you can't break your promise.

1385
02:01:59,151 --> 02:02:01,471
Then, l've escaped.
- Now l promise.

1386
02:02:01,951 --> 02:02:03,750
lf you break your promise,

1387
02:02:03,951 --> 02:02:05,951
or if l know that you've broken,

1388
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:09,239
Radha will not be yours.

1389
02:02:17,670 --> 02:02:22,151
Babu, can we finish him off?
- Yes, we can.

1390
02:02:22,630 --> 02:02:26,991
lt's better, right?
- Yes.

1391
02:02:27,750 --> 02:02:28,750
Okay get up.

1392
02:02:29,750 --> 02:02:31,590
Whom are you going to finish?

1393
02:02:34,391 --> 02:02:36,351
lt's Raman Unni Nair.

1394
02:02:37,031 --> 02:02:38,590
We're going to finish him off.

1395
02:02:39,071 --> 02:02:41,351
Lets go.

1396
02:02:51,511 --> 02:02:53,790
How are we going to finish him off?

1397
02:02:54,471 --> 02:02:56,710
We've decided to finish him off. Lets do it.

1398
02:02:56,911 --> 02:02:59,071
How can we step back?

1399
02:02:59,191 --> 02:03:03,511
Will you go there
& kill him straight away?

1400
02:03:03,750 --> 02:03:04,550
No.

1401
02:03:04,830 --> 02:03:08,911
We'll tie his legs
& hands & bring him here.

1402
02:03:09,830 --> 02:03:12,550
We'll throw him from the dam.

1403
02:03:12,951 --> 02:03:14,550
What do you say Babu?

1404
02:03:14,790 --> 02:03:16,830
Then, there is another problem.

1405
02:03:17,311 --> 02:03:20,071
He lives with his wife & children.- Yes.

1406
02:03:20,071 --> 02:03:21,750
Won't they scream?

1407
02:03:22,351 --> 02:03:25,311
On hearing their scream,
the villagers will surround us.

1408
02:03:25,311 --> 02:03:30,471
Babu, stop the car.

1409
02:03:44,710 --> 02:03:51,231
There is a way.
Can we burn his house?

1410
02:03:52,790 --> 02:03:55,590
Won't everyone run for their lives?

1411
02:03:57,191 --> 02:04:02,911
when they are in a confusion,
we can bring him here,

1412
02:04:03,271 --> 02:04:04,911
and dump him in the dicky.

1413
02:04:05,710 --> 02:04:08,031
lt'll be a confusion all over
when the house is on flames.

1414
02:04:08,231 --> 02:04:11,830
Which was the car? Who took him?

1415
02:04:11,830 --> 02:04:12,670
That's a good idea.

1416
02:04:46,151 --> 02:04:49,351
ls everything ready?
- Yes.

1417
02:04:50,511 --> 02:04:51,750
Who is there?

1418
02:04:56,630 --> 02:04:59,710
lt's me.- What do you want?

1419
02:05:00,151 --> 02:05:01,351
ls there any problem?

1420
02:05:01,550 --> 02:05:03,951
Come here, Mr. nair.

1421
02:05:04,071 --> 02:05:05,471
A small problem.

1422
02:05:12,071 --> 02:05:15,911
l was wondering to see a car at midnight.

1423
02:05:20,431 --> 02:05:22,951
What are you doing here at this late hour?

1424
02:05:33,750 --> 02:05:34,391
Open the door.

1425
02:06:11,550 --> 02:06:13,031
Take your hands off from his mouth.

1426
02:06:13,151 --> 02:06:15,351
Lets see whether he will shout.

1427
02:06:16,311 --> 02:06:19,431
Don't kill me.

1428
02:06:22,750 --> 02:06:25,750
lf you shout, l'll kill you.

1429
02:06:28,231 --> 02:06:29,151
l'll move from that place.

1430
02:06:29,351 --> 02:06:31,951
l'll kill you. Don't shout.

1431
02:06:33,231 --> 02:06:35,151
Now, you don't need
to move from that place.

1432
02:06:35,351 --> 02:06:37,351
We are going to throw you in to the dam.

1433
02:06:38,511 --> 02:06:41,151
Oh my god! Save my children.

1434
02:06:46,351 --> 02:06:48,031
Shut his mouth with a cloth.

1435
02:06:52,630 --> 02:06:54,391
No need of that. l won't shout anymore.

1436
02:06:54,590 --> 02:06:56,311
You shouldn't.- No l won't.

1437
02:06:56,550 --> 02:06:58,750
Can l pray?- yes.

1438
02:08:09,590 --> 02:08:11,351
We can put him on the floor.

1439
02:08:28,670 --> 02:08:31,871
Stab him.

1440
02:08:32,790 --> 02:08:39,630
lf l kick you, you'll fly like a football.

1441
02:08:47,311 --> 02:08:50,311
When will you move from that place?
- By tomorrow.

1442
02:08:50,630 --> 02:08:52,111
Do you know where you've to go?- l know.

1443
02:08:52,311 --> 02:08:54,911
Where?- As Menon told.

1444
02:08:55,111 --> 02:08:57,271
Don't change your mind tomorrow.

1445
02:08:57,471 --> 02:08:58,231
No.

1446
02:09:00,911 --> 02:09:05,191
Can you find the way back to your house?
- l know.

1447
02:09:05,670 --> 02:09:07,071
How do you know?- l know.

1448
02:09:07,271 --> 02:09:09,550
How do you know?- l said l know.

1449
02:09:12,151 --> 02:09:14,151
Do you want us to drop you there?

1450
02:09:14,200 --> 02:09:15,200
l can go by myself.

1451
02:09:15,351 --> 02:09:17,231
No one should know about this.

1452
02:09:17,431 --> 02:09:19,550
No.
Not even my children will know about this.

1453
02:09:21,231 --> 02:09:22,991
Then, can we leave him?

1454
02:09:28,231 --> 02:09:33,231
Should we leave him 
just like that?

1455
02:10:18,951 --> 02:10:20,670
Did he leave that place after that?

1456
02:10:21,391 --> 02:10:22,391
He's going to move.

1457
02:10:22,911 --> 02:10:24,750
Work has started to build a new house.

1458
02:10:26,111 --> 02:10:32,790
Father gave this place to
Malani Sister to build a house.

1459
02:10:33,351 --> 02:10:34,790
Sister has no one.

1460
02:10:35,151 --> 02:10:37,991
lt is difficult to stay somewhere all alone.

1461
02:10:40,431 --> 02:10:44,111
lf he didn't agree to move,
would you kill him?

1462
02:10:44,431 --> 02:10:45,351
l won't.

1463
02:10:46,271 --> 02:10:48,991
Thank god everything went fine.

1464
02:10:49,311 --> 02:10:54,790
Or else this problem would have
continued for a long time.

1465
02:10:55,191 --> 02:10:58,351
Atlast, everything ended in peace.

1466
02:11:00,271 --> 02:11:02,151
Mother doesn't know about this, does she?

1467
02:11:02,351 --> 02:11:05,830
Mother feels your arrival is a good sign.

1468
02:11:06,111 --> 02:11:08,311
Raman changed his mind

1469
02:11:08,511 --> 02:11:10,991
and was ready to move from there.

1470
02:11:11,271 --> 02:11:12,271
That's good.

1471
02:11:12,431 --> 02:11:13,590
But l'm not talking about that.

1472
02:11:13,790 --> 02:11:15,471
This should've been done 5 yrs. back.

1473
02:11:15,710 --> 02:11:17,431
Who?- Both of you.

1474
02:11:17,630 --> 02:11:20,151
Everything needs time.

1475
02:11:21,111 --> 02:11:23,871
You don't have to take it so lightly.

1476
02:11:24,071 --> 02:11:29,790
lf it is not so, you should've come
to Mannarthudi 1 1/2 yr back.

1477
02:11:30,111 --> 02:11:31,710
Why did you come so late?

1478
02:11:31,951 --> 02:11:33,151
Why didn't that happen?

1479
02:11:38,670 --> 02:11:40,351
So, this is good.

1480
02:11:40,376 --> 02:11:42,376
You too checked it?

1481
02:11:42,401 --> 02:11:44,070
Yes...

1482
02:11:44,071 --> 02:11:46,351
Apart from me,

1483
02:11:46,550 --> 02:11:51,271
l've also asked Nanuezhuthachan
to look into the horoscopes.

1484
02:11:51,911 --> 02:11:53,191
And the surpise thing is that,

1485
02:11:53,391 --> 02:11:58,031
he too has seen such matching
horoscopes very rarely.

1486
02:11:58,550 --> 02:12:00,311
lt is because of our good deeds.

1487
02:12:00,550 --> 02:12:03,471
Radha's exams got over last week.- yes.

1488
02:12:03,670 --> 02:12:04,710
He told.

1489
02:12:05,750 --> 02:12:08,271
So, you are also interested
to perform this marriage soon.

1490
02:12:08,790 --> 02:12:11,911
Father, have you fixed the auspicious hour?

1491
02:12:12,111 --> 02:12:16,790
Auspicious dates are plenty
for the next two months.

1492
02:12:16,871 --> 02:12:18,630
Most of the marriages are
performed in these 2 months.

1493
02:12:19,031 --> 02:12:21,991
Lets fix a date which is
convenient for both the families.

1494
02:12:22,111 --> 02:12:24,111
Only the venue has to be fixed.

1495
02:12:24,271 --> 02:12:25,951
That's enough, ah?

1496
02:12:28,550 --> 02:12:31,151
That's why you bought a car.- Yes.

1497
02:12:31,351 --> 02:12:33,550
And also to go round with the new bride.

1498
02:12:34,750 --> 02:12:37,151
You need petrol to run a car.

1499
02:12:37,431 --> 02:12:38,231
l know.

1500
02:12:38,590 --> 02:12:41,351
You shouldn't become a
Thambooran of Mannarthudi then.

1501
02:12:41,550 --> 02:12:45,231
You shouldn't say that
bus is better for us.

1502
02:12:45,431 --> 02:12:48,630
lf you are very scared,
postpone your marriage.

1503
02:12:48,871 --> 02:12:51,431
Only after becoming a husband,
we'll know about your stingy character.

1504
02:12:51,630 --> 02:12:52,670
Now you are very lavish.

1505
02:12:52,871 --> 02:12:54,191
C'mon, please stop it.

1506
02:12:54,391 --> 02:12:58,511
To be frank, only after her exams,
Radha has become a free bird.

1507
02:12:58,710 --> 02:13:00,471
lf l were Radha,

1508
02:13:00,670 --> 02:13:03,431
l would've agreed
for marriage only after a year.

1509
02:13:04,031 --> 02:13:05,790
Still, l don't have any problem.

1510
02:13:06,071 --> 02:13:08,670
What? Don't have any problem?

1511
02:13:09,991 --> 02:13:11,191
You've to pay for that too.

1512
02:13:50,511 --> 02:13:51,951
Yes, it is Jaikrishnan speaking.

1513
02:14:13,191 --> 02:14:17,511
Where are you calling from?
- From a far off place.

1514
02:14:20,351 --> 02:14:24,590
ls it raining there?
- No.

1515
02:14:24,831 --> 02:14:26,331
But it is raining here.

1516
02:14:28,550 --> 02:14:31,391
Marriage over?
- No.

1517
02:14:33,590 --> 02:14:37,311
As you said, Radha's exams
must be over by now.

1518
02:14:38,710 --> 02:14:39,910
Yes, her exams are over.

1519
02:14:40,391 --> 02:14:42,790
So, was Clara counting the days?

1520
02:14:42,991 --> 02:14:46,031
Yes, 
why are you delaying your marriage?

1521
02:14:46,231 --> 02:14:48,911
It will happen in next month.

1522
02:14:49,991 --> 02:14:52,471
We are busy to fix the date.

1523
02:14:53,031 --> 02:14:55,871
So, are you sure it will happen next month?

1524
02:14:58,951 --> 02:15:01,231
Do you remember we had a promise.

1525
02:15:02,031 --> 02:15:05,391
We can meet till Radha
comes to Mannarthudi.

1526
02:15:06,511 --> 02:15:07,391
l do remember.

1527
02:15:08,271 --> 02:15:09,391
l'm coming.

1528
02:15:10,311 --> 02:15:12,710
l'll inform you about the time
& date in a telegram.

1529
02:15:12,911 --> 02:15:13,951
Just like before.

1530
02:15:16,431 --> 02:15:19,511
Will you really come or not?

1531
02:15:20,391 --> 02:15:24,271
l will come.
When l say l will come, l mean it.

1532
02:16:16,311 --> 02:16:22,111
She is coming on 1 7th. By 3:30 pm train.- Yes.

1533
02:16:23,750 --> 02:16:28,151
Today is saturday. Only 4 more days.

1534
02:16:29,590 --> 02:16:31,191
At Ottapalam station.

1535
02:16:35,031 --> 02:16:38,910
When she phoned me,
l had a doubt that she'll come.

1536
02:16:39,951 --> 02:16:44,111
That's why l didn't tell you
about her phone call.

1537
02:16:45,670 --> 02:16:49,351
You have the freedom
not to meet her.

1538
02:16:49,951 --> 02:16:52,230
l do have the freedom, but...

1539
02:16:54,111 --> 02:16:55,310
l don't know what to do.

1540
02:16:55,551 --> 02:16:59,471
l don't know how to react
in this girl's matter.

1541
02:17:01,230 --> 02:17:02,670
What is your suggestion?

1542
02:17:03,711 --> 02:17:06,150
lt is your wish.

1543
02:17:43,070 --> 02:17:45,431
Your father & uncle were waiting
for you to come.

1544
02:17:45,590 --> 02:17:47,750
Do you have anything else to say?

1545
02:17:47,951 --> 02:17:49,631
lf you are so hesitating...

1546
02:17:49,711 --> 02:17:51,431
They don't need to go there.

1547
02:17:51,670 --> 02:17:53,830
What if the date is not fixed today.

1548
02:17:54,511 --> 02:17:55,551
We can have it after a week.

1549
02:17:55,750 --> 02:17:57,471
You can go there after l tell you to go.

1550
02:17:57,711 --> 02:18:00,150
what are you saying, my dear?
That's enough.

1551
02:18:00,511 --> 02:18:02,111
Anyway, 1 1/2 yrs. has passed away.

1552
02:18:02,351 --> 02:18:05,070
A week more will make no difference.

1553
02:18:05,271 --> 02:18:07,391
lf you fix the date without my permission,

1554
02:18:07,590 --> 02:18:09,391
the marriage won't happen in that date.

1555
02:18:11,670 --> 02:18:14,230
No point in trying to convince me, sister.

1556
02:18:14,431 --> 02:18:16,391
You're creating a problem on your own,

1557
02:18:16,590 --> 02:18:19,750
spoil your name in the village,

1558
02:18:19,951 --> 02:18:22,471
and when the decision is made,
you disagree.

1559
02:18:22,670 --> 02:18:24,111
ls it a joke?

1560
02:18:24,191 --> 02:18:26,670
Even after asking her many times,
she didn't say anything.

1561
02:18:26,871 --> 02:18:28,511
No need. She will remain here always.

1562
02:18:28,711 --> 02:18:32,070
No need to think about anyother alliance.

1563
02:18:32,310 --> 02:18:35,431
Nowadays, girls go out with their fiance

1564
02:18:35,631 --> 02:18:37,150
and finally disagree with the marriage.

1565
02:18:37,750 --> 02:18:38,631
So be it.

1566
02:18:38,830 --> 02:18:42,711
Whenever l spoke about marriage,
she was angry with me.

1567
02:18:43,070 --> 02:18:44,471
What happened to that now?

1568
02:18:54,371 --> 02:18:56,371
Till now she was hurrying for marriage.

1569
02:18:56,631 --> 02:18:57,711
What happend to her now?

1570
02:18:57,910 --> 02:19:00,031
ls there any problem between you two?
- Nothing.

1571
02:19:00,230 --> 02:19:01,511
Then, why did she say so?

1572
02:19:03,830 --> 02:19:05,631
How did you come?- By taxi.

1573
02:19:05,830 --> 02:19:07,791
My mom won't allow me to sit at home.

1574
02:19:07,999 --> 02:19:09,720
She asked me to talk to you.

1575
02:19:10,351 --> 02:19:12,871
Now our home looks very odd.

1576
02:19:14,670 --> 02:19:17,631
Madavan, you go.
l'm coming to town.

1577
02:19:18,070 --> 02:19:19,631
l'll talk to Radha.

1578
02:19:22,230 --> 02:19:25,631
May be this is our last meeting...

1579
02:19:29,031 --> 02:19:31,830
May be she is coming here
to wish me good bye...

1580
02:19:32,031 --> 02:19:34,070
l already told you. You can do as you wish.

1581
02:19:35,310 --> 02:19:37,310
l won't do anything l feel wrong.

1582
02:19:37,511 --> 02:19:40,990
lf l don't meet her after seeing the telegram,

1583
02:19:41,191 --> 02:19:43,910
then it will be my mistake.

1584
02:19:44,031 --> 02:19:46,391
l didn't tell you to goto railway station.
- Then?

1585
02:19:46,711 --> 02:19:49,310
You try to remember. You'll come to know.

1586
02:20:10,070 --> 02:20:12,631
She knows about it only when l told her.

1587
02:20:12,830 --> 02:20:16,070
l know people
who hides a lot.

1588
02:20:16,271 --> 02:20:18,750
Why did you tell her?
- Because l was sincere.

1589
02:20:19,230 --> 02:20:20,551
lf she can't understand that,

1590
02:20:20,750 --> 02:20:23,271
she doesn't have to come to Mannarthudi.

1591
02:20:24,590 --> 02:20:31,150
l need a girl who understands me.
Let it be Clara or Radha.

1592
02:20:33,471 --> 02:20:36,471
l don't want anyone to come here at this hour.

1593
02:20:37,951 --> 02:20:39,070
l said no.

1594
02:20:42,191 --> 02:20:44,951
l don't want to talk to you.
Then, why come here?

1595
02:20:47,431 --> 02:20:49,590
l won't be here. That's it.

1596
02:20:53,150 --> 02:20:55,791
Who was that?
- Madhavan.

1597
02:20:58,431 --> 02:20:59,791
He wants to talk to me.

1598
02:21:00,111 --> 02:21:02,471
He said he is coming with his friends.

1599
02:21:02,670 --> 02:21:05,590
You can't talk like that.
- What else can l talk?

1600
02:21:06,551 --> 02:21:08,590
l can talk like this only.

1601
02:21:08,615 --> 02:21:10,615
Your anger & talk are crossing limits.

1602
02:21:11,230 --> 02:21:12,951
With whom are you going to create problem?

1603
02:21:13,310 --> 02:21:14,910
What did she tell you?

1604
02:21:54,511 --> 02:21:56,471
Radha, come with me.- For what?

1605
02:21:56,670 --> 02:21:57,791
l want to talk to you.

1606
02:21:57,990 --> 02:22:00,351
Go ahead.
- l can't talk about it here.

1607
02:22:00,351 --> 02:22:03,031
That's why l'm asking to come with me.
Get inside.

1608
02:22:09,111 --> 02:22:12,230
l'll drop you back.
lt won't be late.

1609
02:22:35,551 --> 02:22:36,351
Come.

1610
02:22:56,391 --> 02:22:57,431
She is Mrs. Babu.

1611
02:22:58,511 --> 02:22:59,871
You know them, right?

1612
02:23:01,031 --> 02:23:03,070
You can sit upstairs.
- Go upstairs.

1613
02:23:03,391 --> 02:23:04,271
Come.

1614
02:23:06,951 --> 02:23:10,150
Come. Let play the elephant game.

1615
02:23:16,431 --> 02:23:18,031
Why are playing at this time?

1616
02:23:18,230 --> 02:23:20,031
Get lost.
- Can't you keep quiet.

1617
02:23:20,830 --> 02:23:21,951
Get lost.

1618
02:23:30,511 --> 02:23:32,111
l can understand your doubts.

1619
02:23:32,351 --> 02:23:35,830
Like the register marriage, you want to
know whether this is valid or not?

1620
02:23:36,031 --> 02:23:37,551
Yes. - lt is valid. This is it.

1621
02:23:39,031 --> 02:23:42,111
We have the seal, inkpad & the peon.

1622
02:23:42,351 --> 02:23:44,791
Now, this is a registrar's office since l'm here.

1623
02:23:45,551 --> 02:23:48,631
You sign here & you, here.

1624
02:24:01,791 --> 02:24:02,910
Please come.

1625
02:24:09,511 --> 02:24:13,111
Official function can be later.

1626
02:24:13,310 --> 02:24:14,590
They can decide about that.

1627
02:24:15,750 --> 02:24:18,791
This is for my peace of mind.

1628
02:24:21,310 --> 02:24:23,670
Like you, even Clara also said something to me.

1629
02:24:24,750 --> 02:24:29,111
lf l become your husband,
Clara can't have me.

1630
02:24:30,670 --> 02:24:33,711
Today is 1 7th.- yes.

1631
02:24:36,111 --> 02:24:38,391
She is coming in the afternoon, right?

1632
02:24:38,416 --> 02:24:40,416
Yes.

1633
02:24:40,871 --> 02:24:44,590
Let her come & go.

1634
02:24:46,750 --> 02:24:48,191
Have this in mind.

1635
02:24:48,830 --> 02:24:53,471
lf l ever sign in a marriage register,
it will be next to your signature.

1636
02:24:53,830 --> 02:24:55,750
Otherwise, l will never sign.

1637
02:24:58,830 --> 02:25:04,230
l will sign on someother day, but not today.

1638
02:25:04,471 --> 02:25:08,070
This is only for my peace of mind.
- No need.

1639
02:25:09,791 --> 02:25:15,511
Either you drop me back, 
or let me go by auto.

1640
02:25:20,910 --> 02:25:22,750
Come. l'll drop you.

1641
02:27:48,631 --> 02:27:52,150
l thought you won't come.
- Why did you think so?

1642
02:27:52,351 --> 02:27:54,910
Because you're getting married very soon.

1643
02:27:56,631 --> 02:27:58,471
This time, it will happen, right?

1644
02:27:59,511 --> 02:28:03,951
That's why l came to see you.

1645
02:28:04,150 --> 02:28:09,150
lt will happen. lf not now,
it will never happen.

1646
02:28:09,830 --> 02:28:13,670
Why is it so?
- lt is like that.

1647
02:28:35,750 --> 02:28:37,750
Mr. Moni Joseph, my husband.

1648
02:28:40,830 --> 02:28:44,830
You know him, right?
Mother superior.

1649
02:28:44,871 --> 02:28:45,791
l know him.

1650
02:28:54,150 --> 02:28:57,431
l can't say like that.
But he wants to marry me.

1651
02:28:57,670 --> 02:28:58,830
A bachelor play boy?

1652
02:28:59,031 --> 02:28:59,551
No.

1653
02:29:00,830 --> 02:29:03,431
His wife died in an accident.

1654
02:29:15,271 --> 02:29:16,750
l've to get some water.

1655
02:29:22,711 --> 02:29:23,670
Don't cry.

1656
02:29:25,670 --> 02:29:29,031
When was your marriage?
A year back.

1657
02:29:29,351 --> 02:29:31,910
To be frank, after our last meeting,

1658
02:29:32,111 --> 02:29:35,910
A week after lisitening to that
mad man's cries.

1659
02:29:40,311 --> 02:29:46,311
lf l didn't do this, l feared that
our lives will be ruined.

1660
02:29:54,951 --> 02:29:58,511
We had passed by this place
a couple of times.

1661
02:29:58,871 --> 02:30:00,191
Why didn't you inform me.?

1662
02:30:00,631 --> 02:30:02,750
For you not to remember about me.

1663
02:30:02,951 --> 02:30:05,791
lf you don't see me, you can forget easily.

1664
02:30:31,311 --> 02:30:35,551
My wishes to you & Radha,
though l've not seen her.- l'll tell her.

1665
02:30:35,750 --> 02:30:36,830
Give my wishes to her.

1666
02:30:37,191 --> 02:30:41,791
But don't tell her about my visit.

1667
02:30:41,816 --> 02:30:44,816
Why should she get
worried unnecessarily?
