10 paise on Aslam,
10 paise on Aslam".

27
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:22,002
Rs. 500 on Dedh Taang.

28
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:24,838
Hey Dedh Taang...

29
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:27,207
ask Chilliya Uncle to give the horn's signal faster next time onwards...

30
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,411
turning around at the very end is quite tough.

31
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,012
Speed up.

32
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:33,308
Halt.

33
00:04:33,506 --> 00:04:34,450
He did signal.

34
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:36,879
The meals of the scrupulous remain simple...

35
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,012
while those of scoundrels are sumptuous.

36
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:41,519
Uncle Chilliya, two ‘kheema pao'.

37
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,059
Aslam, my child...

38
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:01,670
Dude, he seems too quiet...

39
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:03,714
think he might make us screm.

40
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,643
The bike was at fault...
not the biker.

41
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:08,918
The money bet on me is wasted.

42
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:13,285
I haven't bet on you yet, but I think maybe I should.

43
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:18,852
Uncle Chilliya, take the amount for the next race from him.

44
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:21,831
lam not talking about loose change...

45
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,525
lam thinking big bucks...

46
00:05:25,224 --> 00:05:27,397
if you two work for me.

47
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:30,604
Your father will receive the money.

48
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:33,109
Don't waste our time,sir.

49
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,779
My dad could even sell me for a bottle of liquor...

50
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:38,442
If you are here for me, transact with me.

51
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:40,548
Far too overconfident, aren't you?

52
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,954
I have no choice but to be, sir.

53
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:46,446
No one's ever tucked me in bed with a lullaby...

54
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:48,683
Nor has anyone ever kissed my head and picked me up when I was down

55
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,456
Check out that attitude!

56
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:53,354
If there is no attitude people are rather rude.

57
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,755
Bloody...

58
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:58,064
Javed, find work for these two.

59
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,136
Your training starts tomorrow onwards.

60
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:07,477
Sir, do tell us your name, at least.

61
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:13,614
Revealing my name will create a dispute for my repute.

62
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:21,320
What's this boss?

63
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:24,484
Of what use can these cradle dwellers be?

64
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:31,995
Javed, the hand that rocks the cradle, rules the world.

65
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:38,238
The loyalty of youth has certain stubbornness.

66
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:43,176
It has the kind of obsession that can spew venom if provoked.

67
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:44,911
Seemed like a big wig.

68
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:46,039
Look Dedh Taang...

69
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,745
so far we have only been kicked around.

70
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:50,447
For the first time ever someone's offered a helping hand.

71
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:51,886
And as I keep saying...

72
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:54,815
stand by those who help you stand.

73
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,887
They may have won you over...

74
00:06:58,451 --> 00:06:59,794
but they are yet kids.

75
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:03,096
We have a whole range of minions dying to work for us.

76
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:08,671
And yet, this kid was the one who dared to negotiate with me.

77
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:12,807
The affluent may inhabit the mansions of this city.

78
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:19,111
But the Lion who rules the jungle, is born on its concrete.

79
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:23,554
Tonight marks the end of our toils. - Yes.

80
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:31,487
We shall dedicate our lives to the bigwig starting tomorrow.

81
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:36,430
Lord, be kind. Lord, have mercy.

82
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,690
And it's time for the match to begin...

83
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:08,992
the umpire is present along with the captains of both of the teams.

84
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,695
Why aren't they tossing?

85
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:18,339
I really can't understand. It's already 5 past start time.

86
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,911
The audience are watching eagerly...

87
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:24,642
they seem quite baffled and restless...

88
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:25,978
as to what is stalling the toss.

89
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:29,876
We should have been well past two overs...

90
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:31,114
when are we going to toss?

91
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,264
Looks like sir doesn't have a coin...

92
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:43,425
shall I give one to you, sir?

93
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:50,637
Heads.

94
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:53,674
He's won the toss.

95
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:55,268
If its heads, we'll bat.

96
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:57,078
Shohaib.

97
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:06,386
Razzak is about to bowl the first ball.

98
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:20,664
Pappaji seems to be playing splendidly...

99
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,438
he's going to hit a six.

100
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:29,406
He is facing the formidable Mustaaq... surely you're joking?

101
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:32,973
Hold your heart...
it's about to start beating faster.

102
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:38,381
Maybe you should hold your heart...

103
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:40,416
it's about to break.

104
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,587
How'd that happen...

105
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:50,158
are you a magician?

106
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:52,463
Not a magician...

107
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:54,465
I am a genie.

108
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:03,737
A genie that fullfils the wishes of beautiful girls.

109
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:10,612
You are quite an astute player.

110
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,120
I used to be a player...

111
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:16,353
now, I am the game.

112
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:23,030
These black shades quite suit you.

113
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:25,626
Someone ones told me that...

114
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:27,762
my future was very bright,

115
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:31,131
since then, I have been wearing these shades.

116
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,935
The batsman is on 99.

117
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:39,510
So close to a century, and out...

118
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:40,646
My God!

119
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:45,182
God isn't interested in today's match, I am...

120
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,121
Papaji will be scoring a century.

121
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,057
The ball has been flung, right into the hold of the fielder.

122
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:50,854
You want to bet?

123
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,156
What are the stakes?

124
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:56,530
If he scores a 100, I score 100 minutes with you in bed.

125
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:57,863
What?

126
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:01,304
Have you lost your mind?

127
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,837
I am a married woman.

128
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:05,637
Out...

129
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,677
wish I had bet...
I would have won.

130
00:11:09,735 --> 00:11:11,146
Why don't you, now?

131
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:13,244
The bet is on.

132
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:14,814
Look...

133
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,145
No ball...

134
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:22,482
no, this can't be.

135
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,358
hat bet was a mere joke...

136
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:29,661
don't take it seriously.

137
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,960
I may relinquish my profits in business...

138
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,367
but not the rewards I win.

139
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:38,674
Come home tonight with the whole reward.

140
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,436
I have... plans for the night.

141
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,205
I know.

142
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:47,115
Tonight you and your husband, Samir Dixit are coming over to mine.

143
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:49,215
You...

144
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:50,776
Shohaib...

145
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,416
My name is Shohaib.

146
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,054
lam having a modest party at mine,

147
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:57,127
your husband can feast on the food...

148
00:11:57,516 --> 00:12:00,053
and I will, on you...

149
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:07,234
You, me, your black saree and red lingerie.

150
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:41,694
You are my desire

151
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:45,133
You are lethal

152
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:49,111
Your poisonous look

153
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:52,843
lntoxicates me

154
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:58,244
A surge of noise fills my ears

155
00:12:58,477 --> 00:13:02,084
it rings across every gathering

156
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:09,732
I have let your passion fill my heart and intoxicate me

157
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:13,630
A surge of noise fills my ears

158
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:17,570
it rings across every gathering

159
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:25,014
I have let your passion fill my heart and intoxicate me

160
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:27,549
You are my desire

161
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:31,545
You are lethal

162
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:35,521
Your poisonous look

163
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,027
lntoxicates me

164
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,064
Mr. DK...
thank you very much for coming.

165
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:47,661
I love my family, sir.

166
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,636
Which film are you making?

167
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:50,037
lam launching my boy.

168
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:52,970
lam interested in girls...
not boys.

169
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:54,511
She is a newbie... rather naive.

170
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,045
The previous one was quite loose.

171
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:57,808
This one could make Satan pray.

172
00:13:58,704 --> 00:14:02,447
You have stolen my heart

173
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,987
With a kiss,

174
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:08,314
Ignited with passion,

175
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:11,657
My heart is on fire

176
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:19,001
In my thoughts... And in my words

177
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:22,765
I find you in everything

178
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:30,276
I have let your passion fill my heart and intoxicate me

179
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:33,007
You are my desire

180
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,686
You are lethal

181
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:52,131
The red light and I go way back.

182
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:54,870
Always chasing me.

183
00:14:55,861 --> 00:14:59,707
Tonight it will be facing me.

184
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:13,550
Samir.

185
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:15,088
Hi.

186
00:15:16,882 --> 00:15:18,520
Your wife is amazing.

187
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,026
You are lucky to have found such a wife.

188
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:22,497
After all, she is my wife.

189
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,499
Surprisingly, she is indeed yours...

190
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:25,934
where is she at the moment?

191
00:15:25,991 --> 00:15:26,901
She must be out...

192
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:30,269
can't expect her to be here with us, can we?

193
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:32,434
What would she do here in your presence.

194
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:33,306
True.

195
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:35,072
Anyway, I will be back.

196
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:36,275
Bye.

197
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:41,916
Mr.Vardhan, why did you stand up?

198
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:44,419
I recall standing up upon your entrance... and besides.

199
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:51,019
I have called for this meeting to ensure no one stands up to me.

200
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:54,256
Sit.

201
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:56,530
Javed.

202
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:02,634
This map belongs to Sultan.

203
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:08,211
And this is Shohaib's Bombay.

204
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:15,783
This map looks like its charred, every spot looks blackened.

205
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:17,985
Which areas are ours?

206
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:21,022
Mr.Vardhan, have you called us here to rub it in our faces?

207
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,919
These grand decisions are out of your comprehension...

208
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:25,989
It's clear...

209
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:29,599
one color... one ruler.

210
00:16:31,623 --> 00:16:34,536
What if we object?

211
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:40,035
If any of you feel they are ahead of me...

212
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:45,708
Then by all means, mark your territories right here on Bombay...

213
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,417
But do remember...

214
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:55,589
the ones who've resisted me, lie in their graves.

215
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:03,590
Post Sultan, Shohaib is the only one worthy of reigning over Bombay.

216
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:06,434
You cannot liken Sultan to Shohaib, Mr.Vardhan...

217
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:08,130
Sultan was a noble guy.

218
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:11,231
I don't care about nobility.

219
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:16,338
I hear the Almighty calls them over to heaven rather hastily.

220
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:18,877
I feel, it is not even his birthday...

221
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:21,810
he called us over here and took away everything...

222
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,046
he didn't leave anything for us.

223
00:17:23,108 --> 00:17:25,054
No point is fighting amongst yourselves.

224
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:26,852
It's all mine...

225
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:31,460
but you'll all get your shares... indeed you will.

226
00:17:32,484 --> 00:17:35,124
We shall keep accounts of all of your businesses, starting today...

227
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:37,128
but we won't steal your right.

228
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:39,927
The remainder of your lives will be dignified and comfortable...

229
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:42,737
you will earn more than you currently do.

230
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:46,732
Mr.Vardhan, where is Rawal?

231
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:50,175
I will explain it to him...

232
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:51,771
he won't go against you.

233
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:54,147
If Rawal agrees, great!

234
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:59,518
If not, I have been using wrong means since I was a kid.

235
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:13,565
Boss?

236
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:16,569
Do you think we overdid it yesterday?

237
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:23,477
Javed, it took me 10 years to make this happen...

238
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:26,509
to gather so much power and funds that...

239
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:29,610
anyone would think twice before raising their voice against me.

240
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:34,324
I don't wish for a part of Bombay...

241
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,593
I want the entire Bombay.

242
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:44,026
Charity at this point, will hurt my craft.

243
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,264
What is happening, Boss?

244
00:18:59,838 --> 00:19:00,714
Stop the car.

245
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:04,443
Get out everyone.

246
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:41,914
Damn it, his name should be Satan not Shohaib,

247
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:43,918
a bloody bomb couldn't kill him.

248
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:47,694
Now, go into hiding, get a disguise, wear a veil... or...

249
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,790
start begging outside temples.

250
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:51,731
But do not get caught...

251
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,628
if even one of our men is caught...

252
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:55,732
only women will be left in all of our homes...

253
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:56,838
only women.

254
00:19:57,729 --> 00:19:58,434
Relax.

255
00:19:58,497 --> 00:19:59,339
What relax?

256
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:02,173
Relax darling, you are getting scared unnecessarily...

257
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:04,710
Shohaib has several rivals.

258
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:07,409
And the bomb didn't have your name written on it.

259
00:20:08,173 --> 00:20:10,915
He does not prove you were behind this.

260
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:15,854
This dirty deed has to be Rawa
's...

261
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:21,728
but he seems to have forgotten that what he begins...

262
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:24,457
is often put to an end by me.

263
00:20:25,023 --> 00:20:27,230
He is taking advantage of your absence in Bombay.

264
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:29,769
He thinks he is secure there.

265
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:35,978
A mosquito gets swatted by the person whose blood it sucks.

266
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:39,046
But it's important to trap the mosquito for that purpose.

267
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:41,182
Javed...

268
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:47,515
there's nothing in Bombay that I can't catch.

269
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:50,224
Meaning?

270
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:52,117
Meaning...

271
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:55,654
Bombay seems to be beckoning after many days...

272
00:20:56,321 --> 00:21:02,738
it's time to see whether she embraces or erases.

273
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:19,345
Sir, the target has stepped out of her home.

274
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:20,287
Follow her...

275
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:22,382
I want you to report each and every movement.

276
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:26,061
Let's go.

277
00:22:02,287 --> 00:22:03,994
Sir, this is a fiasco!
- What happened?

278
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:06,892
Sir, about 5 - 6 taxis have appeared out of nowhere.

279
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:10,103
And sir, a lady wearing a black veil is sitting in all of them.

280
00:22:17,936 --> 00:22:20,314
Were you waiting for Christmas to note down the taxi number?

281
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:26,812
Damle, what is this?

282
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:29,088
Sir, all the taxis have the same number.

283
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:30,057
Bravo...

284
00:22:30,482 --> 00:22:32,826
maybe you morons should switch your professions...

285
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:35,093
and drive taxis for a living instead.

286
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:55,048
You shouldn't have come here on your own...

287
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,918
the entire police force is on your prowl.

288
00:22:58,443 --> 00:23:02,653
The meter can't outrun the taxi no matter what it does.

289
00:23:04,449 --> 00:23:06,122
You haven't changed a bit...

290
00:23:07,986 --> 00:23:11,433
12 years... 6 months... 15 days.

291
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:14,800
Do you remember?

292
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,903
I remember vividly.

293
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:20,475
Do concentrate on the roads though... they have changed.

294
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:23,775
Bombay may have changed it's preferences.

295
00:23:24,803 --> 00:23:29,081
But, I can still drive you around the city with my eyes shut.

296
00:23:39,384 --> 00:23:40,692
Greetings, boss.
- Greetings!

297
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:44,599
Till I am in Bombay...

298
00:23:44,956 --> 00:23:47,129
you will reside upstairs on the second floor.

299
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:52,370
If its your decision, it must be right.

300
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:55,668
Let's lose the cops and put our feet up.

301
00:23:58,136 --> 00:23:59,137
Yes, boss.

302
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:01,244
Where is Aslam?

303
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:05,615
Remember, the Angadiyas, who smuggle diamonds?

304
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,985
He has gone to deal with them...

305
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:12,418
says he gets charged up when he encounters challenges.

306
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:36,810
Hey!
Do you want to get yourself killed?

307
00:24:38,877 --> 00:24:41,348
I have only just made an entrance.

308
00:24:41,374 --> 00:24:43,044
My exit is ages away.

309
00:27:43,194 --> 00:27:45,731
You have looted me and yet saved me.

310
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:49,208
I only indulge in one wrong deed a day.

311
00:27:49,567 --> 00:27:51,103
I didn't get you?

312
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:54,949
To get me, you need a heart, not a mind.

313
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:03,322
Bloody...

314
00:28:03,381 --> 00:28:04,860
Hey, what the hell are you doing Aslam?

315
00:28:05,817 --> 00:28:07,819
How many times am I going to have to bail you out.

316
00:28:07,986 --> 00:28:10,227
I bet you were my wife in my past life...

317
00:28:10,388 --> 00:28:12,129
You are always making me spend.

318
00:28:12,257 --> 00:28:13,395
Let it go man...

319
00:28:13,591 --> 00:28:15,298
I will repay everything someday, okay?

320
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,962
Come on.

321
00:28:26,137 --> 00:28:27,013
Akbar bail?

322
00:28:27,672 --> 00:28:28,343
Greetings.

323
00:28:28,406 --> 00:28:29,646
Greetings to you too.

324
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:33,716
You are here, that means boss is in Bombay too, right?

325
00:28:34,312 --> 00:28:35,985
He has called for you.

326
00:28:38,349 --> 00:28:39,453
Let's go Dedh Taang.

327
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:40,988
Only you.

328
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:55,544
I apologize boss...

329
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,742
I don't feel right about greeting you empty handed...

330
00:28:59,504 --> 00:29:00,949
hence, I got a bit delayed...

331
00:29:04,709 --> 00:29:09,454
These shining coals may make women forgive errors...

332
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:11,192
not Shohaib.

333
00:29:12,183 --> 00:29:13,355
Which error, boss?

334
00:29:13,985 --> 00:29:16,056
I haven't come here to felicitate people.

335
00:29:17,722 --> 00:29:19,326
I have come here to silence someone...

336
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:22,898
he's been whispering to the cops of late.

337
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:24,463
Who is it, boss?

338
00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:29,244
You whisper his name and soon you will hear his scream.

339
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:53,201
Empty this barrel On that traitor.

340
00:29:55,493 --> 00:29:56,437
Who is he?

361
00:30:03,768 --> 00:30:04,439
No.

362
00:30:06,938 --> 00:30:09,384
Either this photo is wrong... or the information you have is wrong.

363
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:12,819
Being wrong hasn't got me where I stand, today...

364
00:30:13,845 --> 00:30:15,381
this pal of yours...

365
00:30:16,247 --> 00:30:20,491
doesn't get arrested over and over again to hobnob with the cops...

366
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:24,596
he goes downtown to tip them off about us.

367
00:30:26,457 --> 00:30:28,368
Bloody mole.

388
00:30:34,532 --> 00:30:35,374
Greetings, boss.

389
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:49,890
Time to step off the fence and choose a side Aslam.

390
00:30:50,949 --> 00:30:54,362
Let's see what weighs more...
friendship or fealty.

391
00:30:55,253 --> 00:30:56,061
Go on.

392
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:00,064
Go on.

393
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:11,671
Dedh Taang, it takes a lifetime to gain trust...

394
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,545
and just a moment to shatter it...

395
00:31:16,107 --> 00:31:17,085
True that!

396
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:20,216
We may not be high borns... but we must refuse to stoop low.

397
00:31:20,912 --> 00:31:21,947
Well said!

398
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,827
You tried to chop off the hand that...

399
00:31:26,951 --> 00:31:28,760
once extended help to us.

400
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,128
Hey...

401
00:31:30,955 --> 00:31:31,956
what are you saying...

402
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:34,032
In our line of work, they say...

403
00:31:36,027 --> 00:31:38,769
your word counts more than your life.

404
00:31:39,964 --> 00:31:42,444
And you have sold out your word.

405
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,444
- What...
- Tell me?

406
00:31:43,801 --> 00:31:44,939
Hey, what are you doing?

407
00:31:45,036 --> 00:31:47,209
You have breached the friendship of all these years...

408
00:31:47,772 --> 00:31:49,877
how dare you deceive boss?

409
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:52,480
Do you believe I am capable of treason?

410
00:31:52,543 --> 00:31:54,921
If boss says you are a traitor, a traitor is what you are.

411
00:31:56,848 --> 00:31:57,758
Aslam...

412
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,594
so duty trumps friendship, then!

413
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:05,934
If your heart is against me Aslam...

414
00:32:06,658 --> 00:32:10,128
place the gun right against my heart and shoot here.

415
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:13,271
Shoot me!

416
00:32:13,998 --> 00:32:14,806
Dammit!

417
00:32:20,905 --> 00:32:21,815
Boss...

418
00:32:24,175 --> 00:32:26,382
words can lie... but not hearts.

419
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:29,023
Dedh taang is a part of me.

420
00:32:30,848 --> 00:32:32,919
if you believe he has betrayed you, I must be punished.

421
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:33,822
Hey!

422
00:32:34,018 --> 00:32:35,520
Stop, Aslam.

423
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:49,412
I wonder why they lament gambling.

424
00:32:51,336 --> 00:32:56,513
I threw a dice upon you both, and won back every penny.

425
00:33:00,044 --> 00:33:02,490
But boss, why do you carry an empty gun around?

426
00:33:03,047 --> 00:33:06,517
Aslam, many have tried to unveil the mystery that is Shohaib.

427
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:09,090
Yet, I am the only one who has ever truly gauged me.

428
00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:16,031
Mention of my name brings men to their knees.

429
00:33:17,462 --> 00:33:19,738
The capacity to drink, the strength to live...

430
00:33:19,931 --> 00:33:22,605
the balance in one's account and the fear of one's name...

431
00:33:23,568 --> 00:33:25,206
should never mitigate.

432
00:33:26,604 --> 00:33:28,447
Right from the first train in the morning...

433
00:33:28,573 --> 00:33:30,109
till the last bottle of liquor at night...

434
00:33:30,775 --> 00:33:35,485
only hunt for Rawal.

435
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:40,253
Get to work.

436
00:33:42,954 --> 00:33:46,333
You know him...

437
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:48,635
I hear he has a lot of pull.

438
00:33:49,427 --> 00:33:52,340
Notify Rawal, that his father's arrived.

439
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:55,272
Awhile ago, I had seen his car...

440
00:33:55,666 --> 00:33:57,577
but, it's been many days since I saw his last.

441
00:33:58,469 --> 00:34:01,006
I don't know, he is crazy...

442
00:34:01,072 --> 00:34:04,053
he comes in a loincloth and chews on betel leaf.

443
00:34:04,242 --> 00:34:06,688
He comes, wearing a hat, and lights ajoint.

444
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:11,193
He is a big fan of Prem Chopra.

445
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:15,993
Hey... where is Rawal?

446
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,027
He is a huge fan of Prem Chopra.

447
00:34:18,089 --> 00:34:20,194
He watches all of his films.

448
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:21,803
This is the information you got?

449
00:34:22,326 --> 00:34:23,828
That he is a fan of Prem Chopra?

450
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:25,931
What do you suggest we do?

451
00:34:26,264 --> 00:34:27,868
Go ask Prem Chopra of his whereabouts?

452
00:34:28,032 --> 00:34:29,568
He even tries to dress up like him.

453
00:34:30,301 --> 00:34:31,871
So are we supposed to go to all the tailors in Bombay...

454
00:34:31,936 --> 00:34:33,438
and ask them for his measurements.

455
00:34:33,504 --> 00:34:35,142
He isn't a burn out like you...

456
00:34:35,807 --> 00:34:38,014
he must be bragging about having the same tailor as Prem Chopra.

457
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:41,681
Connoisseurs often go to great lengths.

458
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:45,420
We need to find out where film stars get their clothes stitched from.

459
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:56,031
lam Turram...

460
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:58,262
Turram Khan.

461
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:01,509
I want a a suit identical to...

462
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:03,409
the one Prem Chopra is wearing in his new film... pronto.

463
00:35:03,701 --> 00:35:07,706
I will pay you twice the cost...
even thrice.

464
00:35:08,005 --> 00:35:11,919
Another Prem Chopra obsessor.

465
00:35:12,376 --> 00:35:14,754
Look at this, even this is a Prem Chopra inspired suit...

466
00:35:14,912 --> 00:35:16,516
we even have to get this one delivered.

467
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:17,525
I could take it off your hands...

468
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:19,994
Certainly not...
what do you mean you can take it off my hands...

469
00:35:20,051 --> 00:35:21,689
how can I give this one away.

470
00:35:21,752 --> 00:35:23,891
Do you know who this is for...

471
00:35:24,088 --> 00:35:27,126
he is a regular here.

472
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:30,739
In fact we sew his clothes keeping Prem Chopra's posters as a reference...

473
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:32,536
prior to film's release.

474
00:35:32,997 --> 00:35:34,442
Then get another one made for him.

475
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:36,308
Excuse me!

476
00:35:36,567 --> 00:35:39,741
Look, we are supposed to deliver this today.

477
00:35:41,439 --> 00:35:42,315
Today itself?

478
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,325
Inside, Rawal is probably playing dress up.

479
00:36:34,158 --> 00:36:35,796
Just keep the car running.

480
00:36:41,632 --> 00:36:44,340
You never step out of home...
with the fear of being spotted.

481
00:36:44,802 --> 00:36:47,806
You are dressing up as though you are getting ready for a party.

482
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,277
My deeds may be filthy...

483
00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:53,921
but I also have a filthy obsession with neatness.

484
00:36:55,746 --> 00:36:58,158
You had promised to show me the world and treat me like a queen...

485
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:01,027
I have been stuck under this roof for 15 days!

486
00:37:02,286 --> 00:37:07,565
Shohaib is on my trail and you keep nagging me...

487
00:37:09,594 --> 00:37:12,438
wait for the matters to cool down...

488
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:14,168
you will soon witness my heat.

489
00:37:16,968 --> 00:37:18,879
You feeling hot Rawal...

490
00:37:19,537 --> 00:37:20,982
Time to cool down.

491
00:37:35,219 --> 00:37:36,027
Rawal?

492
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:52,041
Bastard! you aren't worthy of shooting darts...
let alone bullets.

493
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:57,742
Profanity can be tolerated...
but how dare you slap me.

494
00:37:58,376 --> 00:38:00,481
But what you did deserves slaps...
not claps.

495
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:02,451
Boss, I almost had him...

496
00:38:02,513 --> 00:38:04,686
Like balls, you almost had him!

497
00:38:06,517 --> 00:38:07,962
I had sent you to hunt the crocodile...

498
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:09,692
not start a wild life adventure show.

499
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:14,063
Can you hear the laughter...

500
00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:16,167
can you hear it ring in your ears?

501
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,130
That's the city laughing at us...

502
00:38:18,562 --> 00:38:20,701
mocking my right to rule it.

503
00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:24,571
Remember...

504
00:38:25,736 --> 00:38:31,414
when your foes escape your grasp...
the world emasculates you.

505
00:38:31,876 --> 00:38:34,288
Boss, Rawal might have broken free...

506
00:38:34,912 --> 00:38:36,983
but not without a broken heart.

507
00:38:39,617 --> 00:38:40,857
What do you plan to do?

508
00:38:41,185 --> 00:38:42,789
Kill him in bits and parts?

509
00:38:45,923 --> 00:38:50,895
And anyway, not like Mona was the Juliet to Rawa
's Romeo.

510
00:38:52,296 --> 00:38:56,369
Javed, love is a lot like housemaids these days...

511
00:38:57,601 --> 00:39:01,674
it comes by... does it's work, and leaves.

512
00:39:03,774 --> 00:39:04,775
So true, boss...

513
00:39:06,043 --> 00:39:08,045
people in love are like cars without brakes.

514
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:11,589
Make sure you lock my tyre if it ever happens to me.

515
00:39:13,551 --> 00:39:15,053
That shall not be needed Aslam...

516
00:39:15,953 --> 00:39:18,194
the one who hungers for love...
has no hunger for food.

517
00:39:33,804 --> 00:39:35,477
You wimp, coward, weakling...

518
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:37,277
aren't you ashamed of attempting to commit suicide?

519
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,377
Come on, step down from there, step down.

520
00:39:39,744 --> 00:39:42,156
Hey, what makes you think lam trying to commit suicide?

521
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,892
You were certainly not trying to count fish, come on down.

522
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:49,593
Listen girl, my name is Shohaib.

523
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:52,167
So? It isn't that bad a name...

524
00:39:52,456 --> 00:39:53,594
change it if you dislike it...

525
00:39:53,657 --> 00:39:54,795
why kill yourself?

526
00:39:55,126 --> 00:40:01,077
Looks like the Lord blessed you with goods only neck down.

527
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:03,568
That's no way to talk to a lady!

528
00:40:04,168 --> 00:40:09,413
Talking to women is a waste of time. It's not in my nature.

529
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:11,485
No wonder you are alone.

530
00:40:12,009 --> 00:40:13,079
As are you.

531
00:40:13,644 --> 00:40:14,918
lam new to this city...

532
00:40:15,279 --> 00:40:17,281
I don't know anyone, hence, I am alone.

533
00:40:18,382 --> 00:40:19,827
lam known to this city...

534
00:40:20,384 --> 00:40:23,524
everyone knows me, yet, I am alone.

535
00:40:24,522 --> 00:40:26,502
Why do you always speak such twisted things?

536
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:28,897
Even saints don't walk in straight lines these days...

537
00:40:29,193 --> 00:40:30,729
l, on the other hand...

538
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:33,764
am Satan.

539
00:40:37,034 --> 00:40:38,980
You won't try to commit suicide again, right?

540
00:40:41,038 --> 00:40:42,381
You don't know me...

541
00:40:43,073 --> 00:40:44,643
lam very powerful.

542
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:46,880
The world shivers at my name.

543
00:40:47,211 --> 00:40:48,053
I get it.

544
00:40:48,412 --> 00:40:50,688
You are extremely powerful and hence people are afraid of you...

545
00:40:51,048 --> 00:40:52,721
I"IO wonder YOU are on your OVVH.

546
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:57,327
If I wanted to, I could grab you right here and drown you in the deep sea.

547
00:40:57,721 --> 00:40:59,394
No one will bother to investigate your disappearance.

548
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,360
Why are you talking to me like this?

549
00:41:01,992 --> 00:41:03,528
To begin with, I am trying to save your life...

550
00:41:03,594 --> 00:41:05,471
Why on earth do you think I want to end my life...

551
00:41:05,563 --> 00:41:07,113
But I stopped you, didn't I?

552
00:41:07,139 --> 00:41:08,467
That proves I am nice.

553
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:11,006
And yet, you are being so uncouth to me...

554
00:41:11,335 --> 00:41:15,010
Mr. Shohaib, nevermind your name, change your identity.

555
00:41:21,912 --> 00:41:24,040
Boss, what was she saying?

556
00:41:24,066 --> 00:41:25,783
Want me to get her?

557
00:41:29,587 --> 00:41:33,091
For the first time someone's wishing a virtue upon me...

558
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:34,926
let us not sin.

559
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,366
Let her be...

560
00:41:38,028 --> 00:41:40,770
anyway, people like me hardly come across good people.

561
00:41:43,534 --> 00:41:46,276
When a girl weeps, reasons are multiple.

562
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:50,780
But when a guy weeps, the reason is always a girl.

563
00:41:51,442 --> 00:41:53,115
Fie on Shaheen's father.

564
00:41:53,611 --> 00:41:55,522
The old man isn't letting her meet me.

565
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:57,249
And she won't let me touch him.

566
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:59,627
Says she'll leave me if I hurt him.

567
00:41:59,884 --> 00:42:01,864
This old guy is my bete noir.

568
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:04,360
We are both very sad.

569
00:42:06,457 --> 00:42:08,437
Our friendship is like a tyre and its tube.

570
00:42:09,159 --> 00:42:11,139
If you get deflated, I end up collapsing.

571
00:42:14,064 --> 00:42:16,635
He is you father in law to be...
you can't fight him...

572
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:18,541
but I can.

573
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:19,870
What do you mean?

574
00:42:24,642 --> 00:42:26,588
Father does not let me step foot out of home...

575
00:42:26,677 --> 00:42:28,418
thank goodness he let you come here.

576
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:30,686
Or else, I'd have died of loneliness.

577
00:42:31,248 --> 00:42:34,195
And anyway, I will die or elope but...

578
00:42:34,418 --> 00:42:36,898
I won't be able to survive without Dedh Taang.

579
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:48,039
Maybe you should change his name before pining for him.

580
00:42:48,165 --> 00:42:51,078
Or your wedding card would read, Shaheen and Dedh Taang.

581
00:43:03,213 --> 00:43:09,289
The soldier has arrived on your frontier

582
00:43:09,353 --> 00:43:13,802
He keenly focuses on his target.

583
00:43:13,991 --> 00:43:19,236
The soldier has arrived on your frontier

584
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:24,004
He keenly focuses on his target.

585
00:43:24,201 --> 00:43:29,549
Oh Taiyab... Tell me...
Tell me how how how

586
00:43:29,673 --> 00:43:33,519
Taiyab Tell me... Tell me how how

587
00:43:34,078 --> 00:43:38,959
Your daughter is as beautiful as the taj mahal, And we are awestruck

588
00:43:39,683 --> 00:43:45,190
Your daughter is as beautiful as
the taj mahal, And we are awestruck

589
00:43:45,255 --> 00:43:50,068
Why don't you let Salma be a bride?

590
00:43:50,094 --> 00:43:54,099
Tayab Ali the enemy of love, shame upon you

591
00:43:54,331 --> 00:43:58,245
my best friends enemy <i>,</i> shame upon you

592
00:43:59,036 --> 00:44:02,449
Tayab Ali the enemy of love, shame upon you

593
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:06,644
my best friends enemy shame upon you

594
00:44:07,578 --> 00:44:09,615
The girl and boy are ready

595
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:11,793
But the priest objects

596
00:44:12,049 --> 00:44:14,188
He is so stubborn

597
00:44:14,284 --> 00:44:16,230
He breaks their heart

598
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:21,163
Why don't you let Salma be a bride?

599
00:44:21,225 --> 00:44:25,332
Tayab Ali the enemy of love, shame upon you

600
00:44:25,396 --> 00:44:29,469
my best friends enemy shame upon you

601
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:33,707
Tayab Ali the enemy of love, shame upon you

602
00:44:34,371 --> 00:44:37,909
my best friends enemy shame upon you

603
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:08,107
You are an old player

604
00:45:08,238 --> 00:45:10,013
But we are the new

605
00:45:10,507 --> 00:45:14,421
Between the generation gap are stuck our views

606
00:45:15,012 --> 00:45:16,923
Your days are numbered

607
00:45:17,181 --> 00:45:18,888
So why are you jealous of the young?

608
00:45:19,416 --> 00:45:23,193
Well I know your little secret

609
00:45:23,487 --> 00:45:27,833
Once revealed you are in trouble

610
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:32,271
Once revealed you are in trouble

611
00:45:32,362 --> 00:45:36,174
Once revealed you are in trouble

612
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:41,108
Why don't you let Salma be a bride?

613
00:45:41,171 --> 00:45:45,210
Tayab Ali the enemy of love, shame upon you

614
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:49,585
my best friends enemy shame upon you

615
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:18,845
Oh my eyes are desperate for a glimpse

616
00:46:19,376 --> 00:46:21,356
My desires are on fire

617
00:46:21,578 --> 00:46:25,492
Let your beautiful daughter come to my parlor

618
00:46:26,016 --> 00:46:28,121
My youthful days are flying by

619
00:46:28,252 --> 00:46:30,254
Trying to woo your daughter

620
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:34,527
let the couple now become a family

621
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:38,903
At least now Let two hearts meet

622
00:46:38,996 --> 00:46:43,342
At least now Let two hearts meet

623
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:47,415
At least now Let two hearts meet

624
00:46:47,604 --> 00:46:52,144
Why don't you let Salma be a bride?

625
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:56,348
Tayab Ali the enemy of love, shame upon you

626
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:00,428
my best friends enemy shame upon you

627
00:47:45,095 --> 00:47:46,335
You are quite theatrical!

628
00:47:46,563 --> 00:47:48,907
What with all the singing and dancing.

629
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:52,536
Well, I have always been so.

630
00:47:53,403 --> 00:47:56,407
Even as a kid, I'd dress up in costumes.

631
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:01,887
These two are killing me.

632
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:03,956
You should be ashamed.

633
00:48:03,981 --> 00:48:08,623
Hey Dedh Taang, do you plan on compressing my car to half its size?

634
00:48:13,156 --> 00:48:15,227
What is it that you were saying?

635
00:48:15,759 --> 00:48:17,500
I wasn't saying, I was asking...

636
00:48:17,861 --> 00:48:19,363
what do you do?

637
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:23,302
I slit pockets...
and I slit necks...

638
00:48:24,434 --> 00:48:25,435
Are you a goon?

639
00:48:27,137 --> 00:48:28,172
I am a tailor.

640
00:48:29,172 --> 00:48:30,048
That's okay...

641
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:31,710
I am very scared of gangsters...

642
00:48:32,009 --> 00:48:34,353
you know in Kashmir, where I come from, there isn't a single one.

643
00:48:35,279 --> 00:48:37,225
You are going to get someone screwed someday.

644
00:48:37,881 --> 00:48:40,020
You are quite a top class hottie. But, half-witted.

645
00:48:41,485 --> 00:48:43,021
You can speak English?

646
00:48:43,453 --> 00:48:44,761
Oh indeed. Fluently.

647
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:46,329
Will you teach me?

648
00:48:47,658 --> 00:48:51,003
You will need two lives to learn...
I have only one.

649
00:48:52,996 --> 00:48:54,236
Help me out, please.

650
00:48:58,902 --> 00:48:59,744
Alright.

651
00:49:00,637 --> 00:49:03,015
Pay attention...
to all that I mention.

652
00:49:05,742 --> 00:49:06,584
"A" for...

653
00:49:10,213 --> 00:49:11,556
A... B...
C... D, I know the alphabets.

654
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:14,126
Just want to be able to introduce myself.

655
00:49:14,685 --> 00:49:18,326
I was born in Kashmir...
how would you say this?

656
00:49:18,822 --> 00:49:22,599
That's all?
That's a cakewalk...

657
00:49:24,761 --> 00:49:27,469
'I came out of my mother in Kashmir'

658
00:49:28,265 --> 00:49:29,300
In Kashmir...

659
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:32,511
my father used to work for a newspaper.

660
00:49:33,503 --> 00:49:35,710
My father working for paper.

661
00:49:37,374 --> 00:49:38,478
For paper...

662
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:41,453
I have two sister...?

663
00:49:42,279 --> 00:49:44,088
I two sisters.

664
00:49:45,182 --> 00:49:46,058
Sisters.

665
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:51,629
I have studied till the 11th class...
what do you say...

666
00:49:52,255 --> 00:49:54,667
inter...

667
00:49:54,725 --> 00:49:55,726
Intercourse.

668
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:57,396
Oh yes... perhaps that.

669
00:49:57,494 --> 00:49:58,529
That's right.

670
00:49:59,229 --> 00:50:00,936
But I couldn't complete the intercourse...

671
00:50:01,565 --> 00:50:04,409
I really did want to...
but I couldn't.

672
00:50:07,471 --> 00:50:09,451
I left intercourse in between...

673
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:14,049
heart and body wanted intercourse...
conditions apply.

674
00:50:15,545 --> 00:50:16,853
Conditions apply...

675
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:20,161
maybe that's why my English is so weak.

676
00:50:21,084 --> 00:50:23,906
I don't know English medium intercourse...

677
00:50:23,932 --> 00:50:26,081
only Hindi medium intercourse.

678
00:50:29,826 --> 00:50:30,770
One more.

679
00:50:32,262 --> 00:50:34,105
The Lord has blessed us with a long life...

680
00:50:34,297 --> 00:50:36,573
why do you want to know everything in a day itself.

681
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:39,681
This is enough for today, rest, tomorrow.

682
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:42,350
Alright. Thank you.

683
00:50:43,573 --> 00:50:45,052
This is Bombay.

684
00:50:45,242 --> 00:50:47,654
Out here the slang is, I thank you, now, get going.

685
00:50:48,245 --> 00:50:50,088
I thank you, now, get going.

686
00:50:50,914 --> 00:50:51,790
No big.

687
00:50:52,182 --> 00:50:52,956
What?

688
00:50:53,917 --> 00:50:57,763
If someone thanks you, you say, no big.

689
00:50:58,155 --> 00:50:58,997
No big.

690
00:51:07,264 --> 00:51:09,004
Dude, Shaheen and I don't meet to talk...

691
00:51:09,030 --> 00:51:10,429
what were you ranting on about.

692
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:12,244
What could I do,

693
00:51:12,869 --> 00:51:15,213
you were totalling my car, and that girl.

694
00:51:16,039 --> 00:51:17,211
Who... Jasmine?

695
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:18,879
She is pretty good man...

696
00:51:19,009 --> 00:51:20,215
inexpensive, nice looking and durable.

697
00:51:20,310 --> 00:51:21,846
I don't know about durable...

698
00:51:22,479 --> 00:51:25,323
she has studied till the 11th, and yet I had to teach her,

699
00:51:26,349 --> 00:51:28,693
That 11th is called intercourse in English.

700
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:29,397
What?

701
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:32,529
Dude, do you even know what intercourse means?

702
00:51:32,689 --> 00:51:34,191
Yeah...education till the 11th class.

703
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:38,069
That's called intermediate, not intercourse.

704
00:51:39,296 --> 00:51:40,536
Intercourse means sex.

705
00:51:44,434 --> 00:51:44,935
What?

706
00:51:45,068 --> 00:51:46,069
Yes, sex.

707
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:48,507
Man, she was fumbling with words...

708
00:51:48,572 --> 00:51:50,779
I suffixed inter with course and told her it was intercourse.

709
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:53,588
Way to go, my man!

710
00:51:54,211 --> 00:51:57,249
You taught her sex in the first meeting, itself.

711
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:03,189
If she ends up telling people that she's studied intercourse.

712
00:52:19,536 --> 00:52:20,412
Let's go, mother.

713
00:52:21,171 --> 00:52:23,310
My jaw is aching from faking a smile...

714
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:25,480
yet no one is even throwing me a glance.

715
00:52:26,042 --> 00:52:27,350
Don't be crazy...

716
00:52:28,278 --> 00:52:30,224
you are soon going to be a big heroine...

717
00:52:31,047 --> 00:52:32,822
get used to these parties.

718
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:36,729
Hello.

719
00:52:36,887 --> 00:52:37,831
How are you?

720
00:52:37,888 --> 00:52:38,730
Very well... and you?

721
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:40,096
Doing very well.

722
00:52:41,758 --> 00:52:43,101
You are looking great, child.

723
00:52:45,629 --> 00:52:46,300
Very nice.

724
00:52:51,034 --> 00:52:51,774
Yes ma'am...

725
00:52:52,269 --> 00:52:55,876
Not you... you, come here.

726
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:06,725
You look greaﬂ!

727
00:53:08,151 --> 00:53:09,721
You look no better.

728
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:11,824
Let me tell you one thing...

729
00:53:11,888 --> 00:53:13,697
get rid of your dark shades, it's night time...

730
00:53:14,291 --> 00:53:15,736
people will snigger at you.

731
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:20,030
People don't laugh at me behind my back....

732
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:22,336
who'd dare to do so to my face and invite their death?

733
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:23,772
Just my luck!

734
00:53:24,067 --> 00:53:25,774
Wonder why I keep bumping into you.

735
00:53:26,069 --> 00:53:29,243
Those who are about to have a bright luck, usually come to my notice.

736
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:31,778
I am quite wary of this brightness...

737
00:53:32,309 --> 00:53:34,448
the whole of Kashmir does not have as many boats...

738
00:53:34,511 --> 00:53:35,854
as this party does, people.

739
00:53:36,179 --> 00:53:39,388
Forget about the boatmen...
come lets find a corner.

740
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:43,326
Hey what kind of girl do you take me for?

741
00:53:43,553 --> 00:53:45,157
I too, have done intercourse.

742
00:53:45,322 --> 00:53:46,164
Intercourse?

743
00:53:46,423 --> 00:53:47,094
Intercourse.

744
00:53:47,324 --> 00:53:47,927
Hey!

745
00:53:48,158 --> 00:53:48,966
Sorry.

746
00:53:49,759 --> 00:53:51,067
Looks are deceptive...

747
00:53:51,328 --> 00:53:52,636
I topped intercourse.

748
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:55,635
Had Mr.DK not called me here to become an actress...

749
00:53:55,932 --> 00:53:57,912
I would have gone way beyond intercourse.

750
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:00,245
You are DK's new find?

751
00:54:00,604 --> 00:54:01,241
Yes.

752
00:54:01,972 --> 00:54:03,383
Mr. DK was right...

753
00:54:04,507 --> 00:54:11,152
The previous one was a floosy and this one could force prayers out of Satan.

754
00:54:12,816 --> 00:54:15,456
Usually I get quite flattered when people praise me...

755
00:54:15,819 --> 00:54:17,492
but with you I am unsure.

756
00:54:17,554 --> 00:54:23,027
Look lady, I have seen more moonlit nights that you can count...

757
00:54:23,393 --> 00:54:25,031
don't cross my path again.

758
00:54:25,295 --> 00:54:27,138
Hey, you seem offended...

759
00:54:27,697 --> 00:54:28,835
please don't go...

760
00:54:29,332 --> 00:54:31,676
if you leave, I will be completely alone here.

761
00:54:34,638 --> 00:54:36,777
Come on then, come with me.

762
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:43,152
Back inside, I was feeling like I was marooned at some unknown place...

763
00:54:43,546 --> 00:54:45,890
everyone seemed like a stranger.

764
00:54:46,883 --> 00:54:49,159
I am not a stranger anymore... that itself is enough...

765
00:54:50,387 --> 00:54:55,598
and anyway, apart from the sea, Bombay is known for Shohaib.

766
00:54:59,262 --> 00:55:00,969
Back inside, there are so many big stars...

767
00:55:01,064 --> 00:55:02,873
and here, the sky seems devoid of all stars.

768
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,536
You want to gaze at stars?

769
00:55:06,002 --> 00:55:08,448
Just say it and I will show them to you,

770
00:55:08,605 --> 00:55:10,676
to many, I have shown stars during the day...

771
00:55:11,608 --> 00:55:13,417
I can certainly show you stars at night.

772
00:55:13,543 --> 00:55:16,285
ls there such a place? Let's go there.

773
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:19,483
We needn't go anywhere" I just have to make a call.

774
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:22,259
Hundreds will clamour to paint the skies for you.

775
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:23,663
How come?

776
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:26,122
I will order a power cut in the city...

777
00:55:26,756 --> 00:55:28,463
then it will be easy to spot stars...

778
00:55:28,858 --> 00:55:31,031
keep counting them for as long as you like.

779
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:35,703
You plan on robbing the light from other people's home for me?

780
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:37,910
No thanks...
I don't wish to see the stars.

781
00:55:38,768 --> 00:55:40,227
So what do you wish for?

782
00:55:40,253 --> 00:55:42,502
Say the word and you shall have it.

783
00:55:44,107 --> 00:55:45,609
Are you my father?

784
00:55:45,775 --> 00:55:49,313
You speak as though, you have taken me
piggyback and brought me to a carnival.

785
00:55:49,379 --> 00:55:51,552
What do you want, say it, I will get it for you.

786
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:54,017
To begin with, I am quite stressed out...

787
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:56,587
I came all the way to be an actress, but I am scared now.

788
00:55:57,554 --> 00:56:01,024
lam a nonentity around these bigwigs... what's my identity?

789
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:04,368
Come with me.

790
00:56:04,828 --> 00:56:05,533
Where?

791
00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:08,639
You wish you see stars, don't you?

792
00:56:09,799 --> 00:56:12,006
Come I will turn you into one.

793
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:13,758
What's the matter?

794
00:56:13,784 --> 00:56:15,067
You seem pretty nervous.

795
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:16,616
Not at all.

796
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:19,778
lam just not used to speaking without a script. Hence...

797
00:56:19,843 --> 00:56:21,345
Save your energy.

798
00:56:21,845 --> 00:56:24,348
As it is, best actress award is going to be mine.

799
00:56:24,447 --> 00:56:25,755
lam going to hand it over.

800
00:56:49,706 --> 00:56:54,018
And the award for this year's most beautiful face goes to...

801
00:56:54,544 --> 00:56:55,750
Ms. Jasmine...

802
00:56:58,848 --> 00:57:02,955
Jasmine Sheikh.

803
00:57:25,542 --> 00:57:28,489
The most beautiful face of tonight's night.

804
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:35,824
These awards last just for one year...

805
00:57:37,086 --> 00:57:41,796
but blessings stay with you forever... and hence...

806
00:57:43,793 --> 00:57:45,864
I would like to entreat you all to pray for me.

807
00:57:53,703 --> 00:57:57,014
And yes, I thank you, now, get going.

808
00:58:31,441 --> 00:58:33,443
There are two kinds of men in this world.

809
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:35,285
Ones that desert you at every chance...

810
00:58:35,612 --> 00:58:37,250
and ones that look for chances to be there for you.

811
00:58:37,547 --> 00:58:39,288
The ones that let go of chances are not real men...

812
00:58:39,649 --> 00:58:42,289
but today I shall drop you home.

813
00:58:42,852 --> 00:58:45,856
I keep making room for chances, come on, sit.

814
00:58:56,933 --> 00:58:59,072
Tonight, I realized that you are no ordinary man.

815
00:59:00,169 --> 00:59:02,479
Ordinary men are like fruits...

816
00:59:02,839 --> 00:59:06,446
people extract them, or chop them...

817
00:59:07,343 --> 00:59:10,051
or even eat them up.

818
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:12,957
Even your talks are quite profound.

819
00:59:13,283 --> 00:59:14,887
Don't judge me by my looks...

820
00:59:15,151 --> 00:59:18,132
they say my brain is worthy of being kept in a museum.

821
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:21,534
Alright...
what does your father do?

822
00:59:22,959 --> 00:59:24,961
Poor guy was a cop.

823
00:59:25,662 --> 00:59:26,640
And you?

824
00:59:26,863 --> 00:59:27,773
A thief.

825
00:59:29,132 --> 00:59:32,045
As a kid my dad and I would play the game chase,

826
00:59:32,435 --> 00:59:34,176
You are bound to win that game.

827
00:59:35,038 --> 00:59:36,108
And why is that?

828
00:59:36,906 --> 00:59:38,886
You roam around wearing these dark shades...

829
00:59:39,309 --> 00:59:41,619
no one can tell what lies in your heart.

830
00:59:41,978 --> 00:59:43,218
Very aptly observed.

831
00:59:45,148 --> 00:59:47,424
Take those shades offjust once...

832
00:59:48,151 --> 00:59:49,892
I will be the cop then, and you the theif,

833
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:51,731
and then we can see who wins.

834
00:59:52,488 --> 00:59:55,697
Take it off... what happened, are you afraid?

875
01:00:04,867 --> 01:00:07,211
These eyes are like avenues of peril...

876
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:10,341
on one side you have an abyss and on the other, a steep hill...

877
01:00:11,341 --> 01:00:12,684
try not to fall.

878
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:21,051
You do look decent without them...
quiet and docile...

879
01:00:21,417 --> 01:00:23,328
why are you so fond of looking like a ruffian?

880
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:32,569
You know what your eyes say?

881
01:00:32,762 --> 01:00:33,740
What?

882
01:00:34,931 --> 01:00:38,276
That you have never been in love...
but in doubt several times.

883
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:40,076
In doubt?

884
01:00:40,203 --> 01:00:43,480
Yes. Doubt about whether anyone's made for you or not...

885
01:00:44,107 --> 01:00:46,212
doubt about whether she is trustworthy"

886
01:00:46,676 --> 01:00:47,984
Doubts...

887
01:00:50,413 --> 01:00:52,859
get rid of these glasses Mr.Shohaib...

888
01:00:52,885 --> 01:00:54,750
..eyes show the path to hear.

889
01:00:55,418 --> 01:00:58,524
And yours show that, that path has not been ventured for a long time, now.

890
01:01:04,594 --> 01:01:08,872
Now don't ask me to get rid of anything else...

891
01:01:09,832 --> 01:01:12,335
Or my decency will start wearing off.

892
01:01:12,935 --> 01:01:14,346
ls there any left?

893
01:01:31,788 --> 01:01:32,926
What are you doing here?

894
01:01:33,089 --> 01:01:35,626
As the saying goes...
woman makes the world go round.

895
01:01:36,125 --> 01:01:38,662
The skull in the danger symbol, has got to be that of a woman's.

896
01:01:39,095 --> 01:01:40,574
Why do you seem so stressed?

897
01:01:40,630 --> 01:01:43,474
Stressed... I haven't been able to find any rest&

898
01:01:47,637 --> 01:01:50,846
tell me, do you often meet a lot of people?

899
01:01:51,674 --> 01:01:53,517
I meet people, don't keep a count.

900
01:01:55,411 --> 01:01:57,152
You haven't told anyone, have you?

901
01:01:57,814 --> 01:01:58,588
What?

902
01:01:59,215 --> 01:02:00,193
That you...

903
01:02:02,585 --> 01:02:03,563
have done intercourse.

904
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:05,365
I did tell one &

905
01:02:05,888 --> 01:02:07,799
and why not?
what's there to be ashamed of.

906
01:02:07,857 --> 01:02:09,029
You are dead, As
am&

907
01:02:09,425 --> 01:02:11,200
you have stoked all the wrong sparks.

908
01:02:12,929 --> 01:02:14,237
I don't get this...

909
01:02:14,630 --> 01:02:16,871
earlier, I was distressed about having had intercourse...

910
01:02:17,033 --> 01:02:19,206
now you seem distressed about the intercourse...

911
01:02:19,869 --> 01:02:21,507
why are you so scared of intercourse?

912
01:02:21,838 --> 01:02:23,112
The thing is...

913
01:02:24,474 --> 01:02:27,182
intercourse is not an educational qualification.

914
01:02:27,810 --> 01:02:29,153
What is it, then?

915
01:02:30,046 --> 01:02:31,354
How do I put it&

916
01:02:33,082 --> 01:02:35,688
in films, when two flowers collide...

917
01:02:36,419 --> 01:02:38,421
intercourse is what is transpiring behind them&

918
01:02:39,288 --> 01:02:41,632
and clothes are found strewn on the floor...

919
01:02:42,492 --> 01:02:43,698
intercourse is taking place...

920
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:47,071
and when a girl screams out to all her gods and begs to be released...

921
01:02:47,130 --> 01:02:49,701
that means she isn't interested in the intercourse...

922
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:53,903
intercourse means sex.

923
01:02:54,971 --> 01:02:56,917
God! What have you made me say!

924
01:02:57,373 --> 01:02:58,818
Look, don't be upset&

925
01:02:59,075 --> 01:02:59,984
you want to study, don't you?

926
01:03:00,010 --> 01:03:01,137
Here, I have got you some stuff...

927
01:03:01,644 --> 01:03:03,214
look, here's a pen&

928
01:03:03,479 --> 01:03:04,787
it's quite an amazing tool...

929
01:03:05,014 --> 01:03:10,123
when you twist it's neck, it changes.

930
01:03:10,586 --> 01:03:11,860
Who do you think I am...

931
01:03:12,021 --> 01:03:13,694
to start with you made me say obscene things...

932
01:03:13,756 --> 01:03:15,429
and then you show me these obscene things.

933
01:03:15,591 --> 01:03:16,729
I thought you were a well mannered guy!

934
01:03:16,826 --> 01:03:18,271
But, I am well mannered&

935
01:03:18,594 --> 01:03:19,690
I did say sorry, didn't I?

936
01:03:19,716 --> 01:03:21,190
Or I would never do such a thing.

937
01:03:21,264 --> 01:03:23,266
But you have brought disgrace upon me.

938
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:25,275
Look, don't take my words to heart...

939
01:03:25,701 --> 01:03:28,477
ask me for anything...
I will bring you the moon and stars, even...

940
01:03:28,738 --> 01:03:31,309
just remember, if I bring you the moon...

941
01:03:31,374 --> 01:03:33,820
the others won't be able to celebrate Eid...

942
01:03:34,076 --> 01:03:36,613
and if I bring you the stars, the moon will be quite lonesome.

943
01:03:37,914 --> 01:03:39,757
If that's the case, let the moon be lonely...

944
01:03:40,283 --> 01:03:43,389
I won't talk to you till you show me stars.

945
01:03:52,061 --> 01:03:55,372
Boss, why do you come and stand here everyday?

946
01:03:56,532 --> 01:04:00,981
You'll only spot the waves, not the girl.

947
01:04:01,337 --> 01:04:02,315
Let's go.

948
01:04:03,639 --> 01:04:06,017
Javed, what do I say?

949
01:04:08,444 --> 01:04:11,186
Since, I have met her even your face looks appealing to me.

950
01:04:16,085 --> 01:04:17,996
Aslam, where are you taking me?

951
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:19,689
Wait up...

952
01:04:23,626 --> 01:04:26,072
look forget the about the stars, the intercourse and everything.

953
01:04:26,195 --> 01:04:27,572
I don't wish to see anything.

954
01:04:27,663 --> 01:04:28,816
Just do as I say...

955
01:04:28,842 --> 01:04:30,965
and hurry up or we'll get killed.

956
01:04:55,091 --> 01:04:57,537
Open your eyes Kashmiri hottie...

957
01:04:59,061 --> 01:05:00,369
did that hurt you at all?

958
01:05:02,999 --> 01:05:04,205
Look, this is Bombay.

959
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:07,506
Your dreams will only come true if you keep your eyes open...

960
01:05:08,404 --> 01:05:09,610
nevermind.

961
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:12,015
No.. one more time... please.

962
01:05:38,501 --> 01:05:40,640
if I could live such a life just for two days even..

963
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:42,477
I'd gladly accept death on the third.

964
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:46,020
I wish I could spend the entire night here.

965
01:05:47,209 --> 01:05:48,552
Yeah, so stay put.

966
01:05:48,578 --> 01:05:49,771
No rent here...

967
01:05:51,213 --> 01:05:53,454
and anyway, Bombay works on two things...

968
01:05:53,916 --> 01:05:55,793
one is luck and the other is local train...

969
01:05:56,152 --> 01:05:57,631
if one leaves, another one is always close behind.

970
01:05:57,720 --> 01:05:59,757
I must say, thank you, now get going.

971
01:06:00,022 --> 01:06:00,796
No big!

972
01:06:01,390 --> 01:06:04,166
lowed you this...
I had to make it up.

973
01:06:04,527 --> 01:06:05,980
I wasn't talking about you...

974
01:06:06,006 --> 01:06:07,658
I meant Shaheen and Dedh Tanng.

975
01:06:08,264 --> 01:06:10,801
Has they not met me, I wouldn't have met you...

976
01:06:11,367 --> 01:06:14,439
and I would not have been able to witness this view.

977
01:06:15,171 --> 01:06:17,082
Dedh Taang's my mate...
that's cool...

978
01:06:17,373 --> 01:06:19,148
but don't speak of Shaheen to me.

979
01:06:19,342 --> 01:06:20,218
Why?

980
01:06:21,544 --> 01:06:23,251
He was my sole friend...

981
01:06:23,312 --> 01:06:25,292
the shotgun to my car...
just him and I...

982
01:06:26,182 --> 01:06:29,026
but since he's met Shaheen...
he has lost it.

983
01:06:29,285 --> 01:06:31,492
Oh I see. You are jealous...

984
01:06:32,221 --> 01:06:35,293
your mate is getting married and you are still single.

985
01:06:39,428 --> 01:06:42,034
I don't get the way this city functions...

986
01:06:43,165 --> 01:06:46,442
everyone is alone...
everyone has a yearning...

987
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:51,577
pining heart...
yet they are afraid to love...

988
01:06:52,908 --> 01:06:54,251
to make friends.

989
01:06:55,277 --> 01:06:56,881
Real friends are like tears...

990
01:06:58,080 --> 01:07:00,617
they come as soon as your heart breaks.

991
01:07:02,985 --> 01:07:06,728
If you ever doubt my friendship...
toss a coin...

992
01:07:07,323 --> 01:07:09,394
if its heads, my friendship is true.

993
01:07:10,326 --> 01:07:11,361
And if its tails?

994
01:07:11,827 --> 01:07:13,329
Then turn the coin around, mate...

995
01:07:13,629 --> 01:07:15,165
no one will know if you are alone.

996
01:07:18,734 --> 01:07:20,680
Love is that curse

997
01:07:22,538 --> 01:07:24,449
Love is that curse

998
01:07:25,274 --> 01:07:28,346
The one who has been touched by it, has burnt

999
01:07:29,612 --> 01:07:31,717
It begins from the heart

1000
01:07:32,681 --> 01:07:34,217
It begins from the heart

1001
01:07:34,350 --> 01:07:37,058
And takes over the senses

1002
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:40,098
Sometimes with itself, sometimes with god

1003
01:07:40,289 --> 01:07:42,701
Sometimes it has even fought with the world

1004
01:07:44,293 --> 01:07:46,933
Many have condemned it

1005
01:07:47,630 --> 01:07:49,906
Yet everyone speaks of it

1006
01:08:01,677 --> 01:08:09,994
The conspiracy of love&

1007
01:08:12,121 --> 01:08:20,006
The game of love

1008
01:08:22,565 --> 01:08:27,565
I have lost it all, in the gamble of two hearts

1009
01:08:43,419 --> 01:08:46,025
Why have you made me so lazy

1010
01:08:46,055 --> 01:08:48,535
Why did you stir up feelings in my heart?

1011
01:08:48,657 --> 01:08:51,035
Gave me an abundance of love

1012
01:08:51,227 --> 01:08:53,639
What have you done ?

1013
01:08:53,929 --> 01:08:56,341
I wander without a purpose

1014
01:08:56,532 --> 01:08:58,773
A star away from the moon

1015
01:08:59,101 --> 01:09:01,604
lam lost in love

1016
01:09:01,670 --> 01:09:04,276
What have you done ?

1017
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:09,380
I have defeated the world and come here,

1018
01:09:09,678 --> 01:09:14,525
Only to lose to you, thus is your effect on me

1019
01:09:14,650 --> 01:09:17,290
Ill tell you the secret of my heart,

1020
01:09:17,353 --> 01:09:19,833
Whenever to breathe

1021
01:09:19,955 --> 01:09:22,458
I say your name

1022
01:09:22,525 --> 01:09:25,028
What have you done ?

1023
01:09:46,382 --> 01:09:52,389
Or my body is addicted to the fragrance of your breath

1024
01:09:52,488 --> 01:09:56,868
I have started living it up a little more

1025
01:09:56,926 --> 01:10:02,774
When the shadow of your eyes fall on the desert of my heart

1026
01:10:02,865 --> 01:10:05,869
I drink a little more to life

1027
01:10:07,069 --> 01:10:12,178
what you mean to me I cannot fathom, but...

1028
01:10:12,308 --> 01:10:17,121
Wherever I go, Its only you I mention

1029
01:10:17,279 --> 01:10:19,850
I have a feeling you will accept my love

1030
01:10:20,049 --> 01:10:22,325
Seems like this battle I have won

1031
01:10:22,551 --> 01:10:24,929
I feel rejuvenated

1032
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:27,498
What have you done?

1033
01:10:27,790 --> 01:10:30,293
Ill tell you the secret of my heart,

1034
01:10:30,392 --> 01:10:32,872
Whenever to breathe

1035
01:10:33,062 --> 01:10:35,474
I say your name

1036
01:10:35,564 --> 01:10:38,067
What have you done?

1037
01:10:59,555 --> 01:11:02,832
My heart wants to listen to you speak

1038
01:11:02,891 --> 01:11:05,371
Its a raw deal I made

1039
01:11:05,561 --> 01:11:09,338
A profit without aninvestment

1040
01:11:10,065 --> 01:11:13,046
Why should I ruin myself?

1041
01:11:13,335 --> 01:11:15,713
Sacrifice myself for you

1042
01:11:15,904 --> 01:11:19,943
Strange are the rules of love

1043
01:11:20,142 --> 01:11:25,023
Now that our paths have crossed

1044
01:11:25,214 --> 01:11:30,186
I have decided to tread on it carefree

1045
01:11:30,352 --> 01:11:32,923
Tell me, whose permission I need

1046
01:11:33,088 --> 01:11:35,432
Tell me, should a request be made

1047
01:11:35,591 --> 01:11:38,037
My smiles now seem so fake

1048
01:11:38,260 --> 01:11:40,740
What have you done?

1049
01:11:40,796 --> 01:11:43,242
Ill tell you the secret of my heart,

1050
01:11:43,465 --> 01:11:45,741
Whenever to breathe

1051
01:11:46,101 --> 01:11:48,581
I say your name

1052
01:11:48,637 --> 01:11:51,140
What have you done?

1053
01:12:06,989 --> 01:12:11,989
I have lost it all, in the gamble of two hearts

1054
01:12:35,851 --> 01:12:36,761
ACP Sawant.

1055
01:12:37,186 --> 01:12:39,188
How many years have it been since you were posted?

1056
01:12:40,322 --> 01:12:43,394
As many as, have been since your birth...
who is this?

1057
01:12:43,625 --> 01:12:44,968
Your promotion...

1058
01:12:46,128 --> 01:12:48,938
I have news that will ensure a badge on your sleeve.

1059
01:12:49,798 --> 01:12:50,606
What news?

1060
01:12:50,733 --> 01:12:53,907
The corpse found in the Madh Island bungalow was Mona's.

1061
01:12:54,903 --> 01:12:56,473
Jimmy is her murderer...

1062
01:12:56,805 --> 01:12:58,580
and Jimmy is one of Shohaib's henchmen.

1063
01:12:58,707 --> 01:12:59,708
And who are you?

1064
01:12:59,808 --> 01:13:01,344
The cops want Mr.Shohaib's.

1065
01:13:02,444 --> 01:13:04,185
Even I want Mr.Shohaib's.

1066
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:07,524
Get hold of Jimmy, you will get your answers.

1067
01:13:14,490 --> 01:13:15,468
Say it...

1068
01:13:16,191 --> 01:13:18,102
you shot on Shohaib's orders...

1069
01:13:19,461 --> 01:13:20,531
why did you kill Mona?

1070
01:13:20,863 --> 01:13:22,672
Who is Mona? Which Mona?

1071
01:13:23,499 --> 01:13:25,536
I don't know any Monas...

1072
01:13:26,068 --> 01:13:28,844
I only know that federal dogs like you all...

1073
01:13:28,904 --> 01:13:33,410
can't harm me in any way without evidence.

1074
01:13:38,113 --> 01:13:41,560
We may not be able to harm you...
but we can hang you..

1075
01:13:43,085 --> 01:13:46,123
but if you wish to you can save your beloved neck.

1076
01:13:47,256 --> 01:13:49,566
Confess that you shot on his behest...

1077
01:13:49,858 --> 01:13:51,462
become a federal witness.

1078
01:13:51,660 --> 01:13:53,196
If you have evidence against me...

1079
01:13:53,495 --> 01:13:55,941
arrest me... drag me to the court.

1080
01:13:56,432 --> 01:14:00,847
Shohaib will destroy all evidence before your judge can announce the verdict.

1081
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:10,755
I won't get scared and help federal dogs like you win a medal.

1082
01:14:11,513 --> 01:14:15,393
Officer, nor am I going to be your way to a medal...

1083
01:14:18,220 --> 01:14:21,758
and neither am I going to betray Shohaib... get it?

1084
01:14:26,195 --> 01:14:26,798
Fine...

1085
01:14:27,796 --> 01:14:29,639
get going then... come on...

1086
01:14:30,566 --> 01:14:31,909
you are of no use to me.

1087
01:14:35,370 --> 01:14:36,212
Should I leave?

1088
01:14:36,505 --> 01:14:38,246
Yes, before I change my mind.

1089
01:14:41,810 --> 01:14:42,811
Okay.

1090
01:14:51,453 --> 01:14:53,490
The ones who walk on your path...

1091
01:14:54,323 --> 01:14:56,860
are the ones who often try to cross your path.

1092
01:14:56,959 --> 01:14:57,798
What's the matter?

1093
01:14:57,824 --> 01:14:58,895
Who is bothering you?

1094
01:14:59,528 --> 01:15:00,336
Jimmy!

1095
01:15:01,263 --> 01:15:03,800
In his bid to scale greater heights, he has fallen to ground.

1096
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:06,279
He is a bloody traitor.

1097
01:15:07,436 --> 01:15:08,244
Jimmy?

1098
01:15:09,605 --> 01:15:12,051
He had shot Rawa
's girl, right?

1099
01:15:12,841 --> 01:15:14,286
The cops nabbed him.

1100
01:15:14,343 --> 01:15:15,822
Just command us boss...

1101
01:15:16,178 --> 01:15:18,317
we'll go finish him while he is still locked up.

1102
01:15:19,081 --> 01:15:23,120
Sreenu caught him and released him within 10 minutes...

1103
01:15:23,819 --> 01:15:28,791
he had Shohaib by the scruff of his collar, and he let it go...

1104
01:15:30,325 --> 01:15:31,099
why?

1105
01:15:31,793 --> 01:15:33,932
Looks like Jimmy has joined hands with the police...

1106
01:15:34,663 --> 01:15:37,303
he has saved his life and endangered ours.

1107
01:15:37,933 --> 01:15:41,039
Javed, if he truly has tattled to the cops...

1108
01:15:42,170 --> 01:15:44,116
I will put an end to his tale.

1109
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:45,641
Come on, get the car out.

1110
01:15:45,707 --> 01:15:46,549
No, boss...

1111
01:15:48,277 --> 01:15:52,020
perhaps the cops have released the goat as a bait for the lion,

1112
01:15:52,047 --> 01:15:54,049
to get him to emerge, so they can grab him...

1113
01:15:56,218 --> 01:15:59,597
it's best if you don't go...
you want Jimmy, right?

1114
01:16:01,757 --> 01:16:03,065
I will bring Jimmy to you.

1115
01:16:55,510 --> 01:16:57,922
Looks like there are several dogs trying to guard the house...

1116
01:16:59,014 --> 01:17:00,288
that means Jimmy is inside.

1117
01:17:00,482 --> 01:17:03,190
If boss has asked for jimmy, he wants him at any cost, Aslam.

1118
01:17:03,619 --> 01:17:05,155
Even I have given him my word...

1119
01:17:05,754 --> 01:17:08,496
now, even if I have to lose my life, boss will have jimmy...

1120
01:17:35,984 --> 01:17:38,089
Hey, if you can't handle it, why do you drive it?

1121
01:17:38,987 --> 01:17:40,173
I will ride it the way I want.

1122
01:17:40,199 --> 01:17:41,424
Your father didn't pay for it.

1123
01:17:41,623 --> 01:17:43,762
Tell your mother to put a learners' sign on it.

1124
01:17:45,427 --> 01:17:46,997
Looks like this one wants to play.

1125
01:17:47,095 --> 01:17:48,938
Let's go teach him how it's done.

1126
01:18:07,549 --> 01:18:09,051
Hey, stop this tussle...

1127
01:18:09,117 --> 01:18:11,461
stop this chaos.

1128
01:18:17,993 --> 01:18:21,236
Sir, ACP sir...
inspector Damle here.

1129
01:18:21,363 --> 01:18:22,433
Tell me Damle, what's the matter?

1130
01:18:22,497 --> 01:18:25,808
Out here, near the lodge, some bikers have broken into a fight...

1131
01:18:27,235 --> 01:18:28,771
one guy is entering the lodge, sir.

1132
01:18:28,970 --> 01:18:30,347
My guess was right...

1133
01:18:30,872 --> 01:18:34,547
whoever it is, should not escape...
I will be right there.

1134
01:18:44,653 --> 01:18:46,360
Aslam, you?
What's happening here...

1135
01:18:46,688 --> 01:18:48,326
what's all the chaos about?

1136
01:18:49,291 --> 01:18:50,599
Boss has sent for you...

1137
01:18:51,059 --> 01:18:52,340
he is quite concerned.

1138
01:18:52,366 --> 01:18:53,530
You are one of us.

1139
01:18:54,629 --> 01:18:55,630
Wear that.

1140
01:18:56,231 --> 01:18:58,233
A lot of federal traffic...
let's go...

1141
01:18:59,134 --> 01:19:00,477
What's the hurry?

1142
01:19:01,870 --> 01:19:03,816
Bombay Police can sniff such things from a distance.

1143
01:19:04,372 --> 01:19:05,578
What did you think?

1144
01:19:05,707 --> 01:19:07,209
That you'd be able to slink away?

1145
01:19:07,409 --> 01:19:09,446
Tell me...tell me where Shohaib is.

1146
01:19:10,979 --> 01:19:12,322
Tell me...tell me where Shohaib is.

1147
01:19:15,217 --> 01:19:16,662
Shohaib is here.

1148
01:19:18,987 --> 01:19:20,762
Boss, what are you doing here?

1149
01:19:20,956 --> 01:19:25,837
Aslam, tables are turned when people turn.

1150
01:19:27,696 --> 01:19:29,266
Boss... what are you sayin?

1151
01:19:29,798 --> 01:19:30,742
I am your boy.

1152
01:19:31,233 --> 01:19:32,712
I will count to three.

1153
01:19:32,968 --> 01:19:34,917
Girls have boys.

1154
01:19:34,943 --> 01:19:36,770
I need a man.

1155
01:19:37,739 --> 01:19:39,309
Boss, I was there just for 5 minutes...

1156
01:19:39,741 --> 01:19:43,120
they only asked me a few things and let me go.

1157
01:19:43,345 --> 01:19:44,415
One...

1158
01:19:44,613 --> 01:19:46,354
How is it my fault...
I have done no wrong.

1159
01:19:46,448 --> 01:19:49,986
Your fault is that the police have sniffed you now...

1160
01:19:51,052 --> 01:19:53,123
and your scent can bring them to me.

1161
01:19:53,522 --> 01:19:54,330
Two...

1162
01:19:56,091 --> 01:19:58,162
Those bastards have tricked me, they have tricked me, boss.

1163
01:19:58,260 --> 01:19:59,432
You may be right...

1164
01:20:01,429 --> 01:20:03,204
but, what can I do Jimmy...

1165
01:20:05,167 --> 01:20:07,169
I can watch you die.

1166
01:20:07,936 --> 01:20:08,710
Boss.

1167
01:20:09,137 --> 01:20:11,208
But I can't watch you with skepticism.

1168
01:20:11,807 --> 01:20:12,478
Three...

1169
01:20:20,615 --> 01:20:22,026
Aslam come.

1170
01:20:23,018 --> 01:20:24,793
Move... leave...

1171
01:22:32,514 --> 01:22:35,051
You are mourning over Jimmy's death...

1172
01:22:35,951 --> 01:22:37,555
or over my victory?

1173
01:22:39,454 --> 01:22:42,901
Boss, it is a possibility that he was trapped into this?

1174
01:22:44,726 --> 01:22:47,639
He was trapped today... he could have gotten me trapped someday...

1175
01:22:48,229 --> 01:22:50,368
did you notice the Police arrangement...

1176
01:22:51,032 --> 01:22:55,811
had we been caught, they'd have killed us.

1177
01:22:58,340 --> 01:23:01,378
Jimmy may have slackened...
but he couldn't have backstabbed you.

1178
01:23:01,643 --> 01:23:04,852
Look Aslam... my ways are clear...

1179
01:23:05,613 --> 01:23:13,555
Champagne for true friends...
and real pain for sham friends.

1180
01:23:18,093 --> 01:23:21,131
A man's virtue can be suppressed...
not destroyed...

1181
01:23:21,997 --> 01:23:25,342
you helped me out of my mucky life, you will always be my hero.

1182
01:23:26,101 --> 01:23:28,945
Every bloody person wants to have a hero...

1183
01:23:29,604 --> 01:23:31,777
people live for the last reel of the film...

1184
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:38,921
hoping that the last reel would have a happy ending...

1185
01:23:40,115 --> 01:23:44,791
I want to decide the ending for everyone in the film, instead...

1186
01:23:45,353 --> 01:23:46,855
I want to have fun...

1187
01:23:47,822 --> 01:23:51,326
heroes need me to be able to exist...

1188
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:56,365
Aslam, I am the villian.

1189
01:24:08,777 --> 01:24:11,018
What if I end up messing up someday?

1190
01:24:16,885 --> 01:24:18,796
Aslam, you are like a son to me...

1191
01:24:19,454 --> 01:24:21,764
I will have an extra peg when I grieve over you...

1192
01:24:22,323 --> 01:24:24,303
but I will kill you.

1193
01:24:29,564 --> 01:24:32,841
I only leave one way open for those who err...

1194
01:24:34,135 --> 01:24:35,375
the way to their graves.

1195
01:24:40,341 --> 01:24:41,251
Shohaib!

1196
01:24:52,487 --> 01:24:54,296
lam glad you called me...

1197
01:24:54,956 --> 01:24:58,233
I do not wish to live on the morsels Shohaib deigns to throw at me.

1198
01:24:58,760 --> 01:24:59,830
No tension.

1199
01:25:00,762 --> 01:25:02,799
I planted a bomb, but he got away...

1200
01:25:03,164 --> 01:25:05,269
joined hands with the cops...
yet, he escaped...

1201
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:09,348
Now, I could bow down, to even a dog who dares to bite him.

1202
01:25:11,406 --> 01:25:14,114
Let me throw you a bone, then.

1203
01:25:14,742 --> 01:25:15,447
Who is this?

1204
01:25:15,743 --> 01:25:17,222
That's Shohaib's latest flame.

1205
01:25:17,612 --> 01:25:19,888
His flames light up and die down every day.

1206
01:25:21,382 --> 01:25:23,293
This dame received an award...

1207
01:25:23,551 --> 01:25:25,292
for having the prettiest face...

1208
01:25:26,121 --> 01:25:28,795
her face hit the headlines before it hit the big screen...

1209
01:25:29,324 --> 01:25:30,029
why?

1210
01:25:31,626 --> 01:25:35,199
Only one person could have managed this... Shohaib.

1211
01:25:36,898 --> 01:25:40,243
He said it and everyone agreed to it.

1212
01:25:42,504 --> 01:25:43,414
I see...

1213
01:25:44,272 --> 01:25:46,411
a chink in his armor.

1214
01:25:46,641 --> 01:25:48,018
I would say.

1215
01:25:49,110 --> 01:25:49,918
Good...

1216
01:25:51,112 --> 01:25:52,819
we have the reins in our hands...

1217
01:25:53,882 --> 01:25:55,657
controlling the horse, should be easy.

1218
01:25:56,117 --> 01:25:59,394
No tension.

1219
01:26:00,054 --> 01:26:02,591
I feel like a pawn, torn between love and friendship...

1220
01:26:02,991 --> 01:26:03,969
What do I do now?

1221
01:26:04,659 --> 01:26:08,163
It is very difficult to choose one of the two.

1222
01:26:09,531 --> 01:26:11,670
But, I will invariably bend towards...

1223
01:26:11,833 --> 01:26:14,404
the one who tugs on my heart strings, won't I?

1224
01:26:14,836 --> 01:26:16,645
She is right, old man!

1225
01:26:17,238 --> 01:26:18,410
Cut!

1226
01:26:18,740 --> 01:26:19,776
Who was that?

1227
01:26:19,802 --> 01:26:21,075
Who said that?

1228
01:26:22,177 --> 01:26:23,160
Very good, Jasmine.

1229
01:26:23,186 --> 01:26:24,478
Come on. Let's proceed.

1230
01:26:24,612 --> 01:26:25,386
Come on!

1231
01:26:25,647 --> 01:26:26,455
Yes.

1232
01:26:26,681 --> 01:26:27,659
Start sound.

1233
01:26:28,383 --> 01:26:30,090
33 by 6. Take 1.

1234
01:26:31,119 --> 01:26:31,927
Action.

1235
01:26:32,086 --> 01:26:34,566
It makes me lose faith in my life...

1236
01:26:35,056 --> 01:26:38,196
as getting what I deserve seems like a strife.

1237
01:26:41,930 --> 01:26:43,034
Okay, cut it!

1238
01:26:43,865 --> 01:26:44,741
Way to go.

1239
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:47,040
Very good, Jasmine.

1240
01:26:47,235 --> 01:26:48,236
Thank you, sir.

1241
01:26:48,570 --> 01:26:51,744
If the big guy has decided to applaud you...
how can I not.

1242
01:26:52,574 --> 01:26:54,212
come on, everyone, pack up...

1243
01:26:54,275 --> 01:26:55,811
go home... rest of it, tomorrow.

1244
01:27:04,752 --> 01:27:05,753
Shall we leave?

1245
01:27:07,488 --> 01:27:08,489
You are back?

1246
01:27:08,556 --> 01:27:10,763
If my mother finds out, she'll kick me out of the house.

1247
01:27:11,259 --> 01:27:14,172
If you want, we could find your old lady a wonderful old man.

1248
01:27:14,662 --> 01:27:16,835
Oh God, you should really consider thinking before talking.

1249
01:27:17,031 --> 01:27:19,170
Thinking,will slight my thoughts.

1250
01:27:21,069 --> 01:27:23,071
I have never met anyone like you.

1251
01:27:23,705 --> 01:27:25,013
And, you never will.

1252
01:27:25,106 --> 01:27:27,143
Because I am unique...just me!

1253
01:27:27,408 --> 01:27:28,386
Come in.

1254
01:27:29,377 --> 01:27:34,190
Well, since you are here anyway, drop me off at Shaheen's.

1255
01:27:36,084 --> 01:27:38,030
Do you see a meter attached to my car?

1256
01:27:38,152 --> 01:27:40,132
Do I look like a taxi driver to you?

1257
01:27:40,622 --> 01:27:43,000
lam here to meet you, not to drop you off.

1258
01:27:43,224 --> 01:27:46,831
I didn't mail you or phone you, and ask you to come, did I?

1259
01:27:46,995 --> 01:27:48,201
Then, do what I ask for.

1260
01:27:49,130 --> 01:27:50,905
Who do you take me for?

1261
01:27:51,899 --> 01:27:54,106
I know you are a very powerful guy...

1262
01:27:54,302 --> 01:27:55,713
that people are afraid of you.

1263
01:27:55,770 --> 01:27:57,215
Now, drive the motorcar, motormouth.

1264
01:27:57,338 --> 01:27:59,511
Who are these people, that are more important to you?

1265
01:28:00,041 --> 01:28:01,714
Shaheen wants to meet her lover...

1266
01:28:01,976 --> 01:28:04,354
and she won't be allowed to go until I accompany her...

1267
01:28:04,646 --> 01:28:06,148
her mother trusts me a lot.

1268
01:28:07,015 --> 01:28:10,428
Wow... trusts you a lot, it seems.

1269
01:28:19,327 --> 01:28:22,501
When in love, a man is much like half a glass of water.

1270
01:28:23,197 --> 01:28:25,177
His thirst is not quenched and nor is his heart contented.

1271
01:28:25,333 --> 01:28:26,209
ls that so?

1272
01:28:30,305 --> 01:28:33,377
When in love, a man is like a cricketer.

1273
01:28:33,841 --> 01:28:35,821
The mind keeps appealing even after the heart is out.

1274
01:28:37,445 --> 01:28:38,515
ls that so?

1275
01:28:41,349 --> 01:28:42,259
When in love...

1276
01:28:42,517 --> 01:28:43,655
What is the matter with you?

1277
01:28:43,885 --> 01:28:45,523
You are going on and on about love.

1278
01:28:46,988 --> 01:28:48,797
lam only telling you the advantages of love.

1279
01:28:49,557 --> 01:28:51,127
Last I checked, you thought love was venom.

1280
01:28:51,225 --> 01:28:52,727
What made it turn to elixir of life?

1281
01:28:55,697 --> 01:28:57,438
A man lives twice as much, when in love.

1282
01:28:57,832 --> 01:28:59,334
At nights, when the world sleep...

1283
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:01,443
he stays up that's twice as much, isn't it?

1284
01:29:04,639 --> 01:29:08,177
Looks like the tailor is wearing his heart on his sleeves these days.

1285
01:29:09,143 --> 01:29:11,214
Not just my heart, my mind as well.

1286
01:29:12,246 --> 01:29:13,850
Yesterday, lost in her thoughts...

1287
01:29:13,948 --> 01:29:15,950
I reached Haji Ali from Bhindi bazaar on foot.

1288
01:29:16,851 --> 01:29:18,228
Who is she, some friend?

1289
01:29:18,986 --> 01:29:19,691
No.

1290
01:29:19,954 --> 01:29:21,262
Who then?
A lover?

1291
01:29:22,023 --> 01:29:23,400
Lover? No way.

1292
01:29:24,158 --> 01:29:25,262
Who else?

1293
01:29:27,028 --> 01:29:28,871
Quite a slice, she is.

1294
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:35,847
Why don't you pour out your heart to this slice of yours?

1295
01:29:38,506 --> 01:29:39,576
You think I should?

1296
01:29:40,775 --> 01:29:41,810
You should.

1297
01:29:44,345 --> 01:29:47,189
Lord, be kind.
Lord, have mercy.

1298
01:30:00,628 --> 01:30:05,270
You our us me...

1299
01:30:07,568 --> 01:30:08,945
What are you trying to say?

1320
01:30:12,273 --> 01:30:15,083
I guess I will only be able to say when
I will lose everything but my speech.

1321
01:30:16,611 --> 01:30:18,818
Why don't you ask your friend to help you?

1322
01:30:19,147 --> 01:30:20,455
There is a saying...

1323
01:30:21,349 --> 01:30:23,761
in my line of work using your friend's pull leaves the friendship dull.

1324
01:30:25,620 --> 01:30:28,760
Your vocation and the sayings you quote do not match at all...

1325
01:30:29,223 --> 01:30:31,225
and what's with your language pull slice.

1326
01:30:31,292 --> 01:30:33,135
Can't you call a girl, a girl, instead?

1327
01:30:34,796 --> 01:30:35,774
When in love...

1328
01:30:37,532 --> 01:30:38,670
Shaheen is here, I am leaving.

1329
01:30:38,766 --> 01:30:40,404
But, Jasmine, listen...

1330
01:30:46,474 --> 01:30:49,614
lfl remain mute, I will never get ahead of the meetcute.

1331
01:30:55,183 --> 01:30:58,926
I asked her if she thinks I am her driver but she doesn't get it.

1332
01:30:59,987 --> 01:31:01,022
When I am around her...

1333
01:31:01,122 --> 01:31:04,729
I feel like a hunter facing a tiger without his rifle she is insane...

1334
01:31:05,893 --> 01:31:06,633
Thank you.

1335
01:31:06,727 --> 01:31:07,831
Now you know...

1336
01:31:08,629 --> 01:31:11,166
what it feels like to have no control around someone.

1337
01:31:11,466 --> 01:31:17,314
I doubt she is capable of thinking she fools around with me...

1338
01:31:17,839 --> 01:31:21,878
lam a pain in the neck of this world and she is.

1339
01:31:24,145 --> 01:31:25,453
This is a...

1340
01:31:28,649 --> 01:31:29,923
Don't another word.

1341
01:31:32,787 --> 01:31:33,697
I won't.

1342
01:31:36,057 --> 01:31:40,403
But bear in my mind, that the life of the one who could give life for...

1343
01:31:41,929 --> 01:31:43,966
may be very different.

1344
01:31:49,837 --> 01:31:54,081
I will turn her life around before that could happen.

1345
01:31:57,345 --> 01:31:59,222
I am so close to these stars...

1346
01:32:00,181 --> 01:32:03,162
it's almost as if they could respond if
I were to speak to them look at them...

1347
01:32:03,417 --> 01:32:04,896
winking at me.

1348
01:32:06,120 --> 01:32:10,728
Not just stars... Lord himself, will be your devotee once he sees you.

1349
01:32:10,892 --> 01:32:13,078
Don't say such things it's a sin.

1350
01:32:13,104 --> 01:32:14,626
Let me stay grounded.

1351
01:32:15,096 --> 01:32:18,407
You are destined for the wide skies, not ground.

1352
01:32:20,935 --> 01:32:23,006
I have dreamt of such a home since childhood.

1353
01:32:24,038 --> 01:32:25,915
I saw your dream, while asleep.

1354
01:32:27,108 --> 01:32:28,280
What do you mean?

1355
01:32:28,876 --> 01:32:30,753
This is the tallest building of the city.

1356
01:32:31,379 --> 01:32:33,723
No one will be closer to these stars than you.

1357
01:32:33,881 --> 01:32:35,588
You can reach over and touch them whenever you want.

1358
01:32:35,783 --> 01:32:36,818
This house belongs to you now.

1359
01:32:37,118 --> 01:32:38,893
Mr. Shohaib, it's not funny.

1360
01:32:40,354 --> 01:32:42,766
You have no idea of the cost of your dreams.

1361
01:32:43,090 --> 01:32:45,366
Dreams are invaluable.

1362
01:32:45,693 --> 01:32:48,469
If the value is high enough, dreams can be bought.

1363
01:32:50,231 --> 01:32:52,138
What are you made of?

1364
01:32:52,164 --> 01:32:55,069
I must check don't you get it?

1365
01:32:55,570 --> 01:32:59,382
The palace of my dreams is not for sale it will be built by my hard work.

1366
01:33:00,207 --> 01:33:04,485
Hard work can get you a mere house not the palace of your dreams.

1367
01:33:05,112 --> 01:33:09,288
Look around this place is replete with everything you need above you...

1368
01:33:10,184 --> 01:33:15,133
these stars crown your head and down below they adorn your feet...

1369
01:33:18,526 --> 01:33:21,132
all of this is for you.

1370
01:33:22,763 --> 01:33:23,741
For me...

1371
01:33:26,500 --> 01:33:28,173
looks like you have misconstrued...

1372
01:33:29,370 --> 01:33:33,250
I should leave it's best if we don't meet again.

1373
01:33:39,013 --> 01:33:40,151
Don't meet again.

1374
01:33:40,448 --> 01:33:43,725
Yes I think you have misunderstood me.

1375
01:33:44,552 --> 01:33:45,724
I have misunderstood?

1376
01:33:46,020 --> 01:33:49,058
Yes I only consider you a good friend.

1377
01:33:50,424 --> 01:33:51,459
Friend...

1378
01:33:54,295 --> 01:33:55,865
what do I do with this house?

1379
01:33:56,263 --> 01:33:57,640
How should I know?

1380
01:33:58,065 --> 01:33:59,703
Sell it, burn it, return it.

1381
01:34:00,635 --> 01:34:01,545
Burn it.

1382
01:34:03,638 --> 01:34:07,484
lam like ash and ashes cannot be set to fire...

1383
01:34:08,275 --> 01:34:11,779
but you have sparked up love in me and
are claiming it to be just friendship.

1384
01:34:12,013 --> 01:34:14,050
But Mr. Shohaib, lam not in love with you.

1385
01:34:14,248 --> 01:34:15,659
Who are you in love with, then?

1386
01:34:15,716 --> 01:34:20,062
Tell me his name I will destroy everything him as well as you...

1387
01:34:20,988 --> 01:34:25,903
remember, a falling star cannot bereave the sky.

1388
01:34:26,327 --> 01:34:28,568
Let me go, Mr. Shohaib.

1389
01:34:30,665 --> 01:34:33,111
It will take me just 5 minutes to defame you in a day...

1390
01:34:33,334 --> 01:34:35,814
I can wipe out your identity...

1391
01:34:36,737 --> 01:34:40,116
Shohaib does not love, lovingly...

1392
01:34:40,875 --> 01:34:42,513
move and leave now.

1393
01:35:01,696 --> 01:35:04,006
Enough of this fun and laughter family drama...

1394
01:35:06,167 --> 01:35:07,475
it's time for some action!

1395
01:35:10,037 --> 01:35:10,913
Mr. Shohaib?

1396
01:35:11,972 --> 01:35:13,815
Your leading lady is rather naive Dk.

1397
01:35:16,010 --> 01:35:19,981
I am her biggest fan, and yet, she is the one with the airs.

1398
01:35:20,581 --> 01:35:22,754
Mr. Shohaib, what are you doing?

1399
01:35:24,151 --> 01:35:25,562
What am I doing?

1400
01:35:26,353 --> 01:35:32,099
She has called my enmity upon herself even my friendship daunts most.

1401
01:35:32,626 --> 01:35:35,038
But Jasmine is just an innocent, young lass, Mr. Shohaib.

1402
01:35:35,463 --> 01:35:38,273
Yes. So innocent that she could make the satan pray...

1403
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:44,548
DK, satan does not pray he possesses the girl he desires.

1404
01:35:52,580 --> 01:35:56,289
Get up, let's go stop the make-up the film has been scrapped he has lost it.

1405
01:35:56,650 --> 01:35:57,628
Who?
- Shohaib.

1406
01:35:57,718 --> 01:35:58,753
Shohaib?

1407
01:35:58,819 --> 01:36:00,457
Yes, Shohaib, the gangster.

1408
01:36:00,688 --> 01:36:01,996
Shohaib, the gangster.

1409
01:36:02,423 --> 01:36:05,199
He is the biggest don on Bombay...

1410
01:36:05,426 --> 01:36:08,498
he has ruined the entire set have you never heard of him?

1411
01:36:34,855 --> 01:36:38,530
I grant you 24 hours If you don't come on your own...

1412
01:36:39,493 --> 01:36:42,235
no angel will come to save you from the devil pack up...

1413
01:36:43,664 --> 01:36:44,574
pack up!

1414
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:46,710
Pack up!

1415
01:36:51,572 --> 01:36:53,108
What have you one?

1416
01:36:56,043 --> 01:36:59,889
I did not know that Shohaib would misapprehend my friendship for love.

1417
01:37:01,148 --> 01:37:05,153
If men could tell friendship and love...

1418
01:37:06,220 --> 01:37:07,893
apart hearts would not have soured...

1419
01:37:08,956 --> 01:37:12,403
you don't belong to this city you haven't been able to gauge the situation...

1420
01:37:13,627 --> 01:37:15,834
Shohaib owns this city and now...

1421
01:37:16,430 --> 01:37:21,345
Shohaib owns you your friendship and your love.

1422
01:37:22,870 --> 01:37:25,510
And if you even dare to give someone else a thought...

1423
01:37:26,106 --> 01:37:29,280
your biggest foe will be Shohaib.

1424
01:37:30,578 --> 01:37:32,683
Does this city not have a police force?

1425
01:37:33,180 --> 01:37:35,387
The Police force exists and they want to arrest him too...

1426
01:37:35,783 --> 01:37:37,285
but they are helpless.

1427
01:37:38,118 --> 01:37:41,861
Had it been anyone else, you would have had my support...

1428
01:37:43,157 --> 01:37:47,105
but I am sorry.

1429
01:38:23,230 --> 01:38:25,904
Look sis now it looks like an actress's home.

1430
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:28,370
Farida, what's all this?

1431
01:38:28,736 --> 01:38:29,840
Look this...

1432
01:38:32,006 --> 01:38:36,352
This is an upgrade to radio any song
can be heard at the highest volume...

1433
01:38:36,577 --> 01:38:40,024
without disturbing anyone it's called a walkman.

1434
01:38:41,315 --> 01:38:44,489
Sis, check out this chandelier.

1435
01:38:45,352 --> 01:38:47,093
Just like in the movies.

1436
01:38:47,388 --> 01:38:51,063
Nothing stays new around here.

1437
01:38:51,292 --> 01:38:54,535
All of this could serve as dowry atyour weddings come on now, rewrap it.

1438
01:38:59,166 --> 01:39:03,046
Child, within a blink of an eye...

1439
01:39:04,038 --> 01:39:06,109
we have received everything one can dream of.

1440
01:39:08,242 --> 01:39:09,516
Who gave us all of this?

1441
01:39:10,344 --> 01:39:12,756
Some gentleman names Shohaib sent this perhaps...

1442
01:39:13,714 --> 01:39:15,159
a fan of yours?

1443
01:39:16,517 --> 01:39:19,191
This glamour has blinded you all...

1444
01:39:21,055 --> 01:39:23,160
do you know what lies around it.

1445
01:39:24,458 --> 01:39:27,530
I don't want any of this not a thing throw it away.

1446
01:39:27,695 --> 01:39:28,901
What are you doing?

1447
01:39:30,698 --> 01:39:32,109
What is the matter with you?

1448
01:39:32,499 --> 01:39:36,914
He is trying to purchase me do you not know who Shohaib is?

1449
01:39:37,538 --> 01:39:41,384
He is a gangster a goon he even shut my film down...

1450
01:39:42,476 --> 01:39:45,855
I do not wish to nurture any relationship with him...

1451
01:39:47,014 --> 01:39:50,086
return all of these things return everything.

1452
01:39:53,454 --> 01:39:56,560
Alright.

1453
01:39:57,725 --> 01:40:00,831
Alright alright child, we will return everything...

1454
01:40:02,196 --> 01:40:04,870
but you say he is a gangster...

1455
01:40:06,600 --> 01:40:09,103
will he take kindly to all the stuff being returned.

1456
01:40:11,772 --> 01:40:15,720
you say he is a dangerous guy why then, are you not afraid...

1457
01:40:17,111 --> 01:40:19,387
what has evoked such courage...

1458
01:40:20,581 --> 01:40:25,428
in you look, tread carefully as it may be easy...

1459
01:40:27,454 --> 01:40:31,925
to turn your back to evil but not to escape it.

1460
01:41:06,827 --> 01:41:09,535
What do you think I look different, don't I?

1461
01:41:10,364 --> 01:41:11,502
Quite dapper.

1462
01:41:12,566 --> 01:41:15,137
The thing is, to reveal one's inner self...

1463
01:41:15,869 --> 01:41:17,246
one must preen one's outer self.

1464
01:41:19,106 --> 01:41:20,915
Even I have an important matter to discuss with you.

1465
01:41:21,041 --> 01:41:24,488
But, me first I have memorized a few lines...

1466
01:41:24,711 --> 01:41:26,884
with much difficulty if I fumble it will be a huge mess.

1467
01:41:28,449 --> 01:41:30,053
You look quite pleased.

1468
01:41:31,819 --> 01:41:33,890
Don't say anything that might make me cry.

1469
01:41:38,492 --> 01:41:39,903
From where I am...

1470
01:41:40,794 --> 01:41:45,106
the candle light is making your eyes
resemble the head lights of a police jeep.

1471
01:41:47,768 --> 01:41:50,078
I refuse to bring tears to these eyes and get arrested.

1472
01:41:51,371 --> 01:41:52,782
Aslam. - No don't stop me...

1473
01:41:57,044 --> 01:42:01,254
the thing is my...

1474
01:42:04,351 --> 01:42:05,989
heart has been attacked by love.

1475
01:42:07,855 --> 01:42:08,560
And...

1476
01:42:08,722 --> 01:42:10,998
Aslam we cannot interact with each other anymore.

1477
01:42:14,561 --> 01:42:15,596
You have got to be kidding me.

1478
01:42:15,662 --> 01:42:18,905
Why don't you understand my mother wants to get me married off...

1479
01:42:19,333 --> 01:42:20,903
she has even put up an ad in a matrimonial...

1480
01:42:21,201 --> 01:42:23,147
Kashmiri educated well off...

1481
01:42:24,071 --> 01:42:25,948
she has mentioned all the details about me, as well

1482
01:42:28,275 --> 01:42:31,552
All the details all of them did she mention that...

1483
01:42:34,748 --> 01:42:37,695
you have envisioned dreams and not comfort did she mention that...

1484
01:42:39,553 --> 01:42:42,830

you toss a coin to assess friendship did she mention that...

1487
01:42:54,902 --> 01:42:59,112
you are like a dream that could give one, sleepless nights.

1488
01:43:03,010 --> 01:43:04,546
No Aslam...

1489
01:43:06,079 --> 01:43:09,026
she hasn't mentioned any of this because no one knows all this about me.

1490
01:43:11,418 --> 01:43:13,455
Even my soul is acquainted with all of this.

1491
01:43:22,029 --> 01:43:25,408
My beloved

1492
01:43:42,449 --> 01:43:45,020
My beloved has become a part of me

1493
01:43:45,085 --> 01:43:47,429

1497
01:43:56,163 --> 01:44:00,908
From me you have separated

1498
01:44:01,368 --> 01:44:08,718
lam Lost in your thoughts

1499
01:44:09,443 --> 01:44:14,222
My days mock me

1500
01:44:14,781 --> 01:44:19,161
The night, gossips about your absence

1501
01:44:19,753 --> 01:44:22,199
My beloved has become a part of me

1502
01:44:22,356 --> 01:44:24,632

My beloved, your love means the world to me

1506
01:44:41,742 --> 01:44:46,851
I dream of you, while I am still awake

1507
01:44:47,247 --> 01:44:50,888
You have taken over my sleep as well

1508
01:44:52,452 --> 01:44:57,629
I stay awake counting stars

1509
01:44:57,858 --> 01:45:02,466
In the moon I see your face embedded

1510
01:45:02,629 --> 01:45:05,337
In the nights you are a punishment

1511
01:45:05,399 --> 01:45:09,142
In the day you are intoxication

1512
01:45:13,473 --> 01:45:19,515
As In your thoughts I am enraptured

1513
01:45:24,117 --> 01:45:28,759
My days mock me

1514
01:45:29,489 --> 01:45:33,938
The night, gossips about your absence

1515
01:45:34,394 --> 01:45:36,772
My beloved has become a part of me

1516
01:45:37,097 --> 01:45:39,441

My love is in your heart, my beloved

1519
01:45:51,278 --> 01:45:52,916
Boss, since when are you a reader?

1520
01:45:53,280 --> 01:45:55,556
Dude, I am not good with words...

1521
01:45:57,017 --> 01:46:02,831
and women pay do not heed you, till you use the right words.

1522
01:46:03,824 --> 01:46:05,326
That's the problem with women...

1523
01:46:05,992 --> 01:46:07,994
we give away our hearts without a thought,
they do not even give us a thought.

1524
01:46:08,228 --> 01:46:09,366
What is the matter with you?

1525
01:46:09,863 --> 01:46:11,900
You look rather gloomy.

1526
01:46:13,133 --> 01:46:15,374
I have been jacked, boss.

1527
01:46:19,172 --> 01:46:20,674
I can't even swallow water...

1528
01:46:21,408 --> 01:46:23,354
let's drink today, rum, whiskey, anything.

1529
01:46:30,484 --> 01:46:33,021
Another one bites the dust.

1530
01:46:34,454 --> 01:46:36,297
Boss, I have learnt one thing.

1531
01:46:38,692 --> 01:46:41,400
A woman can turn a man's life to heaven...

1532
01:46:42,529 --> 01:46:44,805
and a woman can also send a man to heaven.

1533
01:46:45,699 --> 01:46:49,613
Aslam, love is a big riddle.

1534
01:46:50,704 --> 01:46:55,653
If you get it, it's like an almond if not, you get peanuts.

1535
01:46:58,044 --> 01:46:59,614
Boss, you know you needn't worry.

1536
01:47:00,647 --> 01:47:03,890
A glance from you is enough to get a girl to plan a wedding.

1537
01:47:07,220 --> 01:47:08,528
You are right...

1538
01:47:10,557 --> 01:47:12,434
come on, tell me, who is she...

1539
01:47:14,094 --> 01:47:16,040
where does she stay what does she do...

1540
01:47:16,963 --> 01:47:18,772
tell me why are you keeping mum?

1541
01:47:20,033 --> 01:47:23,412
Okay, tell me her name we'll abduct her tell me.

1542
01:47:25,005 --> 01:47:26,814
If I say her, I will end up telling her tale.

1543
01:47:28,275 --> 01:47:32,621
And the tales of love are not for sale.

1544
01:47:37,551 --> 01:47:40,122
You tell me, who are writing to.

1545
01:47:43,156 --> 01:47:46,501
There is this girl a new heroine...

1546
01:47:48,829 --> 01:47:49,899
her name is...

1547
01:47:56,603 --> 01:47:57,411
Hello.

1548
01:48:08,682 --> 01:48:11,595
Aslam, your line may not connect your girl's...

1549
01:48:12,285 --> 01:48:14,356
but your Shohaib's bell has rung.

1550
01:48:14,955 --> 01:48:15,956
Go, get her.

1551
01:48:16,423 --> 01:48:17,993
Building no. 22, Antop hill.

1552
01:48:18,325 --> 01:48:18,962
Go.

1553
01:48:19,125 --> 01:48:21,105
And listen, which building, again?

1554
01:48:21,561 --> 01:48:22,767
22, Antop hill.

1555
01:48:22,963 --> 01:48:24,965
Correct, and listen...

1556
01:48:25,699 --> 01:48:28,441
get her carefully, she is your sister in law.

1557
01:48:41,548 --> 01:48:46,793

01:48:47,020 --> 01:48:51,696
But I know you won?!" "!t meet me know

But return empty handed

1561
01:49:02,469 --> 01:49:04,972
Mixed in my breath

1562
01:49:05,238 --> 01:49:09,015
You are the smoke of love

1563
01:49:13,146 --> 01:49:19,563
lam Lost in your thoughts

1564
01:49:23,790 --> 01:49:29,001
My days mock me

1565
01:49:29,262 --> 01:49:33,733
The night, gossips about your absence

1566
01:49:34,134 --> 01:49:36,671
My beloved has become a part of me

1567
01:49:36,836 --> 01:49:39,316
My love is in your heart, my beloved

1568
01:49:39,573 --> 01:49:41,917
My beloved has become a part of me

1569
01:49:42,208 --> 01:49:44,449
My love is in your heart, my beloved

1570
01:49:44,511 --> 01:49:52,828
My beloved, your love means the world to me

1571
01:49:55,121 --> 01:50:04,508
My beloved, your love means the world to me

1572
01:50:27,187 --> 01:50:28,825
You cam all the way here?

1573
01:50:30,457 --> 01:50:32,767
Did I not tell you that nothing could happen between us?

1574
01:50:33,259 --> 01:50:34,966
Why have you come here, Aslam?

1575
01:50:35,528 --> 01:50:37,439
For God's sake leave me alone.

1576
01:50:39,699 --> 01:50:42,646
Leave, before anyone can spot you.

1577
01:50:44,571 --> 01:50:46,312
I haven't come here for myself.

1578
01:50:46,873 --> 01:50:48,045
What do you mean?

1579
01:50:49,876 --> 01:50:51,378
My boss, Shohaib has sent me...

1580
01:50:53,279 --> 01:50:54,417
for you.

1581
01:50:56,549 --> 01:50:58,187
You work for Shohaib?

1582
01:51:02,455 --> 01:51:04,025
You are the one boss loves?

1583
01:51:28,148 --> 01:51:29,593
The wound is not very deep...

1584
01:51:29,749 --> 01:51:31,126
but, she has lost a lot of blood...

1585
01:51:31,418 --> 01:51:32,522
which is why she is unconscious...

1586
01:51:32,686 --> 01:51:33,596
she will get better, soon.

1587
01:51:35,955 --> 01:51:36,956
Doctor...

1588
01:51:38,124 --> 01:51:39,535
if anything happens to her...

1589
01:51:40,326 --> 01:51:42,101
your postmortem is certain.

1590
01:51:42,228 --> 01:51:43,571
Come with me...

1591
01:51:46,499 --> 01:51:47,876
let me tell you how it works.

1592
01:52:14,928 --> 01:52:16,669
You have started loving her.

1593
01:52:19,599 --> 01:52:22,011
You can't leave this girl and nor can I.

1594
01:52:23,536 --> 01:52:24,310
What?

1595
01:52:25,004 --> 01:52:27,143
Both of us... love Jasmine a lot.

1596
01:52:29,843 --> 01:52:32,915
No, boss. Who said so?
- I said so...

1597
01:52:34,781 --> 01:52:35,759
you and me...

1598
01:52:38,051 --> 01:52:39,655
and Jasmine between us.

1599
01:52:44,924 --> 01:52:46,369
And thus, the fight begins.

1600
01:52:49,262 --> 01:52:51,708
No, boss.
- Not for real, silly...

1601
01:52:52,465 --> 01:52:55,969
but, to lure Rawal out of his hideout, we can pretend so.

1602
01:52:57,737 --> 01:52:58,909
I don't understand.

1603
01:52:59,873 --> 01:53:07,849
Rawal should get the whiff of the conflict between us over Jasmine...

1604
01:53:11,918 --> 01:53:13,989
an enemy of an enemy is a friend...

1605
01:53:14,120 --> 01:53:17,829
as soon as he hears this, he will try to join hands with you.

1606
01:53:19,125 --> 01:53:24,370
That's when we will nab him and his men.

1607
01:53:30,303 --> 01:53:32,749
Boss, do we need to drag Jasmine between all of this?

1608
01:53:33,540 --> 01:53:38,717
The world knows that friendship wanes in front of love...

1609
01:53:40,513 --> 01:53:46,122
Aslam, get prepapred to die for love.

1610
01:53:52,325 --> 01:53:53,790
Aslam has made a big mistake.

1611
01:53:53,816 --> 01:53:55,331
Boss will never forgive him.

1612
01:53:55,361 --> 01:53:58,899
This is like a brother-in-law falling for his sister-in-law

1613
01:53:59,833 --> 01:54:03,337
If Aslam so much as glances at her, boss will gouge his eyes out.

1614
01:54:03,536 --> 01:54:05,607
Loyalty comes to an end, the moment a girl enters the picture.

1615
01:54:05,705 --> 01:54:08,083
Aslam has lost it. He has put his hand in lion's mouth.

1616
01:54:08,174 --> 01:54:09,915
If boss catches him, Aslam will be dead.

1617
01:54:09,976 --> 01:54:11,785
Aslam has chosen the wrong path.

1618
01:54:17,417 --> 01:54:18,725
I have decided...

1619
01:54:20,987 --> 01:54:22,523
I will leave your life...

1620
01:54:24,891 --> 01:54:26,063
end of story.

1621
01:54:34,467 --> 01:54:36,469
The thing I wanted to say to you...

1622
01:54:39,038 --> 01:54:40,608
I cannot say to myself, anymore...

1623
01:54:44,777 --> 01:54:45,755
that l...

1624
01:54:53,286 --> 01:54:54,890
that I love you a lot.

1625
01:55:09,969 --> 01:55:12,449
When a girl drives a wedge between men, they forget loyalty.

1626
01:55:13,072 --> 01:55:18,420
The strings that Aslam has loosened, will be the noose around his neck.

1627
01:55:18,978 --> 01:55:21,015
Could he not find anyone else?

1628
01:55:21,547 --> 01:55:22,855
How could he fall for bss's girl?

1629
01:55:23,082 --> 01:55:24,993
Aslam has turned loyalty to betrayal.

1630
01:55:25,051 --> 01:55:26,291
Will boss chop his head off.

1631
01:55:26,386 --> 01:55:27,160
If boss catches him.

1632
01:55:27,220 --> 01:55:28,790
Aslam has made a big mistake.

1633
01:55:28,988 --> 01:55:30,365
Will boss chop his legs off.

1634
01:55:30,857 --> 01:55:32,495
In my line of work, they say...

1635
01:55:35,795 --> 01:55:39,299
three's a crowd.

1636
01:55:41,734 --> 01:55:43,441
It had to happen with me...

1637
01:55:45,271 --> 01:55:49,617
I was on the verge of hurting my benefactor...

1638
01:55:52,545 --> 01:55:53,683
I have sinned.

1639
01:55:57,083 --> 01:56:00,621
The moment, you gain consciousness and boss gets Rawal...

1640
01:56:01,988 --> 01:56:02,989
lwill...

1641
01:56:06,326 --> 01:56:07,964
thank you and get going.

1642
01:56:08,294 --> 01:56:11,571
ls it true, Chote?

1643
01:56:12,832 --> 01:56:15,335
I hear Shohaib's right hand man has turned into his bete noir?

1644
01:56:15,702 --> 01:56:17,079
100 %, guaranteed news.

1645
01:56:18,037 --> 01:56:19,812
Aslam solicited me for assitance too.

1646
01:56:20,340 --> 01:56:22,445
But, I do not want to mess with Shohaib.

1647
01:56:29,415 --> 01:56:31,918
When we shot Jasmine, they were together...

1648
01:56:33,286 --> 01:56:36,096
if I had known, I would have shook hands with him instead of shooting.

1649
01:56:36,856 --> 01:56:41,362
Anyway, I will do it now...

1650
01:56:42,462 --> 01:56:43,532
no tension.

1651
01:56:46,799 --> 01:56:48,403
My heart is very stubborn...

1652
01:56:50,069 --> 01:56:52,549
I tried to appease it and tell it that it would have to separate from you...

1653
01:56:53,773 --> 01:56:54,911
but it won't listen.

1654
01:56:57,877 --> 01:56:59,515
I am standing on a fence...

1655
01:57:01,614 --> 01:57:03,059
on one side, there's boss...

1656
01:57:05,218 --> 01:57:06,595
and on the other, there's you.

1657
01:57:08,354 --> 01:57:09,958
You are Aslam, right?

1658
01:57:12,492 --> 01:57:13,766
You have got a call.

1659
01:57:22,135 --> 01:57:23,842
lam extending my hand over the phone...

1660
01:57:24,170 --> 01:57:25,308
shake it...

1661
01:57:26,339 --> 01:57:28,615
I will get the job done...

1662
01:57:29,675 --> 01:57:32,349
a house wherever you want...
the car you want...

1663
01:57:32,979 --> 01:57:34,617
the amount you quote...

1664
01:57:34,747 --> 01:57:38,024
you just have to tell me where Shohaib is.

1665
01:57:39,719 --> 01:57:43,030
Post that, you and Jasmine will be free and me too.

1666
01:57:44,357 --> 01:57:46,633
No one knows the consequences of betraying Shohaib like you...

1667
01:57:47,994 --> 01:57:49,496
yet, you are asking me to go against him.

1668
01:57:49,595 --> 01:57:53,839
You went against him, the day you got close to Jasmine.

1669
01:57:57,437 --> 01:57:59,041
I know him since I was a kid...

1670
01:58:00,073 --> 01:58:01,245
he won't harm me.

1671
01:58:01,507 --> 01:58:02,952
Aslam, you are a nice guy.

1672
01:58:04,444 --> 01:58:09,223
Even if you were to leave Jasmine for him, he will not forgive you.

1673
01:58:10,249 --> 01:58:12,991
When she will be forced to love Shohaib...

1674
01:58:13,986 --> 01:58:16,227
you will be resting in peace...

1675
01:58:17,090 --> 01:58:18,330
no tension.

1676
01:58:19,225 --> 01:58:22,172
When she would need to bury her head in your chest...

1677
01:58:22,895 --> 01:58:24,966
you would already be buried underground...

1678
01:58:25,898 --> 01:58:26,899
no tension.

1679
01:58:27,967 --> 01:58:31,642
If, Shohaib were to be weeded out...

1680
01:58:33,139 --> 01:58:36,450
throughout your life you will have... no tension.

1681
01:58:39,612 --> 01:58:40,522
Aslam...

1682
01:58:42,515 --> 01:58:43,425
hello...

1683
01:58:43,983 --> 01:58:45,621
are you listening to me, Aslam.

1684
01:58:46,152 --> 01:58:47,392
lam listening.

1685
01:58:47,887 --> 01:58:50,731
Tell me where Shohaib is.

1686
01:58:52,492 --> 01:58:54,028
Hotel Sheesh Mahal...

1687
01:58:56,129 --> 01:58:56,937
503...

1688
01:59:01,167 --> 01:59:02,544
kill the bastard.

1689
01:59:24,190 --> 01:59:27,228
I don't know if I have done the right thing or not...

1690
01:59:29,028 --> 01:59:30,632
but I did not have a choice.

1731
02:01:03,189 --> 02:01:05,032
How dare you shoot my Jasmine...

1732
02:01:05,858 --> 02:01:07,201
my Jasmine...

1733
02:01:11,430 --> 02:01:12,932
how dare you.

1734
02:01:17,603 --> 02:01:20,709
had you asked me for Bombay, I would have given it to you...

1735
02:01:21,407 --> 02:01:23,045
but, you shot Jasmine...

1736
02:01:24,377 --> 02:01:27,017
this is the end.

1737
02:01:50,503 --> 02:01:54,280
Boss, we will have to leave Bombay today itself...

1738
02:01:55,908 --> 02:01:58,218
so many people have seen you murder him...

1739
02:01:58,644 --> 02:02:00,146
and anyway, Rawal is dead...

1740
02:02:00,513 --> 02:02:02,151
our work is done...end of story.

1741
02:02:04,850 --> 02:02:07,421
In a short while, there will be police dogs everywhere...

1742
02:02:08,487 --> 02:02:10,694
the entire city will be cordoned off by the cops..

1743
02:02:11,223 --> 02:02:12,301
and the cops...

1744
02:02:12,327 --> 02:02:15,128
- Why do you keeping saying police...

1745
02:02:15,194 --> 02:02:16,400
are you crazy.

1746
02:02:22,535 --> 02:02:25,277
Akbar, stop in front of the police station.

1747
02:02:26,872 --> 02:02:27,502
What are you doing, boss.

1748
02:02:27,528 --> 02:02:28,308
This place is very dangerous.

1749
02:02:28,341 --> 02:02:29,149
Quiet.

1750
02:02:39,585 --> 02:02:41,656
Yes sir, the news is sure.

1751
02:02:42,288 --> 02:02:43,665
Rawal was the one who died...

1752
02:02:44,023 --> 02:02:45,661
Shohaib was the one who killed him.

1753
02:02:46,092 --> 02:02:49,938
I have sent two gypsies at mauka-e-vardaat.

1754
02:02:50,229 --> 02:02:53,142
Sawant sir has ordered immediate cordoning...

1755
02:02:53,466 --> 02:02:55,173
this time, Shohaib must not escape.

1756
02:03:01,640 --> 02:03:04,280
Just a black-and-white photo of a man with so many colors

1757
02:03:05,411 --> 02:03:07,618
I must ask Javed to send them another one.

1758
02:03:20,059 --> 02:03:22,232
Today, everyone shall drink an extra peg...

1759
02:03:23,429 --> 02:03:24,999
I have conquered both the domains...

1760
02:03:25,097 --> 02:03:27,008
the heart as well as the world.

1761
02:03:27,133 --> 02:03:29,340
Boss, please do not invite Aslam.

1762
02:03:29,402 --> 02:03:30,244
Why?

1763
02:03:30,302 --> 02:03:31,872
He will rain on your party...

1764
02:03:32,171 --> 02:03:33,912
he seems to be lost in his own world, these days.

1765
02:03:34,039 --> 02:03:36,041
He had come to me as well...

1766
02:03:36,142 --> 02:03:40,386
he looked lovelorn enough to be Romeo's cousin.

1767
02:03:40,880 --> 02:03:42,826
He is quite upset these days, boss...

1768
02:03:43,048 --> 02:03:44,721
he loves that girl a lot.

1769
02:03:45,384 --> 02:03:47,864
Who is this girl?
How is she?

1770
02:03:49,121 --> 02:03:51,328
She is a very nice girl...

1771
02:03:51,857 --> 02:03:53,768
only, she tends to be daft as a brush...

1772
02:03:55,194 --> 02:03:58,300
One day, Aslam, told her that...

1773
02:03:58,631 --> 02:04:01,305
her educational qualification was called intercourse in English...

1774
02:04:02,368 --> 02:04:05,975
she took his word for it and went around telling everyone that...

1775
02:04:06,038 --> 02:04:07,711
she has intercourse.

1776
02:04:08,240 --> 02:04:09,480
What is her name?

1777
02:04:10,443 --> 02:04:11,276
What happened, boss?

1778
02:04:11,302 --> 02:04:12,175
- What is her name?

1779
02:04:15,014 --> 02:04:15,924
Jasmine.

1780
02:04:29,462 --> 02:04:30,463
Jasmine.

1781
02:04:32,431 --> 02:04:33,671
What are you doing?

1782
02:04:34,533 --> 02:04:37,810
I must get out of here, Aslam.
Help me.

1783
02:04:38,170 --> 02:04:40,309
No need to be scared...

1784
02:04:41,474 --> 02:04:42,782
Shohaib is there for you.

1785
02:04:43,175 --> 02:04:44,176
Shohaib...

1786
02:04:46,011 --> 02:04:46,955
where is he?

1787
02:04:47,112 --> 02:04:48,853
He will be here.

1788
02:04:49,448 --> 02:04:51,724
Take me away before he gets here...

1789
02:04:52,284 --> 02:04:55,561
take me somewhere far...
help me.

1790
02:04:56,355 --> 02:04:58,164
Save me from Shohaib.

1791
02:04:59,191 --> 02:05:00,033
What?

1792
02:05:00,259 --> 02:05:02,330
Free me from Shohaib...

1793
02:05:03,762 --> 02:05:06,572
or inject poison in me and kill me right here.

1794
02:05:10,503 --> 02:05:14,542
I bet he has been turning Jasmine against me.

1795
02:05:17,042 --> 02:05:19,249
I will crush him like I would, a snake.

1796
02:05:21,046 --> 02:05:24,323
In stead of ruining my life...
it is better I end my life.

1797
02:05:25,651 --> 02:05:27,562
I am scared of Shohaib.

1798
02:05:28,420 --> 02:05:30,024
Your love has changed him.

1799
02:05:30,256 --> 02:05:31,257
No, Aslam...

1800
02:05:31,824 --> 02:05:34,566
the mannerisms of people like Shohaib may change...

1801
02:05:34,827 --> 02:05:35,805
but, not their nature.

1802
02:05:35,995 --> 02:05:37,906
Deceiving is like second nature to him...

1803
02:05:38,531 --> 02:05:42,377
even, the day I took him under my wing, he was deceiving someone.

1804
02:05:43,836 --> 02:05:47,283
Shohaib loved you a lot...
I know it.

1805
02:05:47,573 --> 02:05:50,850
His love is out of pride...
and by force...

1806
02:05:51,777 --> 02:05:54,485
it isn't love... it cannot be love.

1807
02:05:56,081 --> 02:05:57,685
Boss will make you very happy...

1808
02:05:58,117 --> 02:06:01,098
he will make your dreams come true before you can see them.

1809
02:06:01,787 --> 02:06:04,097
Perhaps, even you won't help me Aslam...

1810
02:06:05,291 --> 02:06:09,364
but, he can only snatch me...

1811
02:06:10,629 --> 02:06:12,165
he will never have me.

1812
02:06:15,467 --> 02:06:17,674
Just like I won over Bombay, twice...

1813
02:06:18,704 --> 02:06:20,911
I will also win over Jasmine.

1814
02:06:31,584 --> 02:06:35,088
I was going to meet Shohaib and kill myself in front of his eyes...

1815
02:06:35,821 --> 02:06:39,894
to prove to him that I am not some city that he can conquer...

1816
02:06:40,459 --> 02:06:41,938
that he can hold in his fist.

1817
02:07:02,214 --> 02:07:05,320
We must leave here, right away.

1818
02:07:26,005 --> 02:07:26,915
Find him.

1819
02:08:04,777 --> 02:08:06,222
So, you don't love boss...

1820
02:08:06,779 --> 02:08:09,020
you showed me the door too...
what's the matter?

1821
02:08:09,648 --> 02:08:10,956
ls there someone else?

1822
02:08:11,684 --> 02:08:15,131
I rejected you only because I did not you to land up in trouble due to me.

1823
02:08:17,156 --> 02:08:18,294
And what about now?

1824
02:08:18,657 --> 02:08:19,601
What about now?

1825
02:08:19,692 --> 02:08:22,434
Did you think I would be willing to run away with just anyone?

1826
02:09:22,254 --> 02:09:23,699
If Shohaib escapes again...

1827
02:09:23,756 --> 02:09:26,396
we will have to approach the Embassy instead of the moles...

1828
02:09:26,658 --> 02:09:29,298
to get tipped off about him.

1829
02:09:30,095 --> 02:09:31,870
This is our last chance.

1830
02:09:32,064 --> 02:09:36,444
We have gheraod all the highways, stations and airports...

1831
02:09:36,735 --> 02:09:39,306
his purpose of coming to Bombay was to kill Rawal...

1832
02:09:39,438 --> 02:09:41,918
hence, he will definitely try to flee Bombay...

1833
02:09:42,674 --> 02:09:44,745
but he won't be successful in doing so.

1834
02:09:45,911 --> 02:09:46,616
Sir.

1835
02:09:56,088 --> 02:09:57,166
Aslam, how did this happen?

1836
02:09:57,192 --> 02:09:58,150
ls everything alright?

1837
02:09:58,457 --> 02:10:00,459
Uncle, look after Jasmine.

1838
02:10:03,462 --> 02:10:05,874
Do not worry nothing will happen to you.

1839
02:10:06,899 --> 02:10:07,707
And you?

1840
02:10:09,368 --> 02:10:11,314
Me and boss are closer than blood brothers...

1841
02:10:12,104 --> 02:10:15,779
he may whack me a little out of rage but he will never truly harm me.

1842
02:10:44,469 --> 02:10:45,504
Aslam...

1843
02:10:47,806 --> 02:10:52,118
it is the end of your tenure and the beginning of boss's with Jasmine.

1844
02:12:13,692 --> 02:12:18,300
You put an end to 12 years of affinity with one bullet...

1845
02:12:20,632 --> 02:12:25,479
if it's come to this know that lam only alive...

1846
02:12:27,839 --> 02:12:29,011
for Jasmine.

1847
02:12:34,046 --> 02:12:36,026
now everyone has to be buried some day...

1848
02:12:37,549 --> 02:12:39,790
if I prostate myself while still alive, my life will be soiled.

1849
02:12:40,285 --> 02:12:43,494
Aslam, the fault is mine...

1850
02:12:44,022 --> 02:12:45,501
I sent Akbar...

1851
02:12:46,792 --> 02:12:51,764
a grave mistake no one else will touch you...

1852
02:12:52,631 --> 02:12:55,737
now no one will lay a hand upon you no one will face you know why?

1853
02:12:57,669 --> 02:13:02,118
Because, bastard, only I will kill you, now.

1854
02:13:04,576 --> 02:13:07,750
Alright then, you stay true to your word...

1855
02:13:09,781 --> 02:13:11,351
and I won't turn my back to my word.

1856
02:13:18,991 --> 02:13:20,698
Boss, we don't have a lot of time.

1857
02:13:21,293 --> 02:13:23,739
When relationships are so fragile...

1858
02:13:24,496 --> 02:13:27,443
ending them does not require a lot of time.

1859
02:13:28,433 --> 02:13:30,936
I will take care of Aslam I will get Jasmine too...

1860
02:13:31,503 --> 02:13:32,641
you must leave here...

1861
02:13:32,804 --> 02:13:34,875
every second step has 4 cops...

1862
02:13:35,340 --> 02:13:37,342
it won't be wise of you to go to Dongri right now.

1863
02:13:37,409 --> 02:13:38,820
Shut down Dongri...

1864
02:13:40,012 --> 02:13:45,086
ban the lawmakers from every entrance and exit to Dongri go.

1865
02:13:46,051 --> 02:13:47,052
Okay boss.

1866
02:13:50,155 --> 02:13:54,103
Shohaib wait, Shohaib don't do this...

1867
02:13:55,093 --> 02:13:57,073
vanquishing your dear ones will won't make you victorious.

1868
02:13:57,095 --> 02:14:00,338
If I let him go now, the world will laugh at me.

1869
02:14:00,899 --> 02:14:02,520
Why do you care for the world?

1870
02:14:02,546 --> 02:14:03,734
Think about Jasmine.

1871
02:14:03,769 --> 02:14:05,248
Jasmine is mine alone...

1872
02:14:06,671 --> 02:14:11,347
Aslam has reduced his life's worth by harboring costly desires.

1873
02:14:11,977 --> 02:14:14,014
The fight for love should be chaste Shohaib...

1874
02:14:14,112 --> 02:14:15,489
yours is just a chase if you kill Aslam...

1875
02:14:16,181 --> 02:14:18,661
Jasmine will be as good as dead and even if she lives...

1876
02:14:18,784 --> 02:14:24,462
even her life even her life will be ruined like mine.

1877
02:14:32,431 --> 02:14:34,342
I have ruined your life?

1878
02:14:35,300 --> 02:14:40,579
A house, clothes, jewelry I have given you all of these valuables.

1879
02:14:42,140 --> 02:14:45,349
You gave me many valuables and took away everything invaluable.

1880
02:14:47,045 --> 02:14:49,548
You gave me joy, but not the kind I could share...

1881
02:14:50,048 --> 02:14:52,255
you gave me presents, but not the kind
I could praise you swept me to the skies...

1882
02:14:52,317 --> 02:14:54,627
and took away the ground from under my feet.

1883
02:14:58,056 --> 02:15:03,005
If you are so unhappy, how about I stop your breathing.

1884
02:15:04,696 --> 02:15:07,233
End it Kill me...

1885
02:15:08,567 --> 02:15:09,910
that's all you can do...

1886
02:15:10,869 --> 02:15:13,281
chop off the head that faces you...

1887
02:15:15,440 --> 02:15:19,388
I don't want this life lam tired of running...

1888
02:15:19,744 --> 02:15:23,385
of hiding, of listening to people's taunts...

1889
02:15:26,985 --> 02:15:31,525
if you don't stop right now, Shohaib, soon Jasmine will take my place.

1890
02:15:35,494 --> 02:15:40,603
Do not invite such ill will, that people start willing your death...

1891
02:15:42,534 --> 02:15:44,810
asking you to make good, would be pointless...

1892
02:15:47,539 --> 02:15:50,019
but, if possible, try to spare one life...

1893
02:15:51,409 --> 02:15:53,389
try to be the hero for once.

1894
02:15:55,046 --> 02:16:00,223
Being a hero would tarnish my identity.

1895
02:16:12,330 --> 02:16:15,800
Son, it's best to call for a truce.

1896
02:16:17,002 --> 02:16:18,572
These are matters of heart, uncle.

1897
02:16:20,438 --> 02:16:22,213
A truce without bruise is not possible.

1898
02:16:33,585 --> 02:16:34,928
Look at your state.

1899
02:16:35,487 --> 02:16:39,458
You cannot even stand...
how will you face Shohaib?

1900
02:16:41,593 --> 02:16:43,800
Courage does not need feet to march ahead.

1901
02:16:54,639 --> 02:16:55,447
ACP Sawant.

1902
02:16:55,540 --> 02:16:57,747
Sawant sir, Shohaib is in Dongri.

1903
02:18:08,580 --> 02:18:12,187
When I first met you, you only reached my knees...

1904
02:18:16,988 --> 02:18:20,902
Today, I will have to bring you down to your knees.

1905
02:18:24,663 --> 02:18:25,437
Aslam.

1906
02:18:26,264 --> 02:18:27,800
It is very easy to shout out...

1907
02:18:27,899 --> 02:18:30,277
half baked threats over a phonecall worth half a penny...

1908
02:18:31,403 --> 02:18:33,508
just like it is, to turn tail, instead of facing me.

1909
02:18:41,479 --> 02:18:42,287
Aslam.

1910
02:18:59,064 --> 02:18:59,804
Aslam.

1911
02:19:03,168 --> 02:19:05,478
Your blood is not thick enough Aslam.

1912
02:19:07,072 --> 02:19:08,983
You could not do right by your loyalties.

1913
02:19:09,207 --> 02:19:11,778
At least try to do right by your your virility... get up...

1914
02:19:14,279 --> 02:19:15,257
get UP-"

1915
02:19:16,948 --> 02:19:18,018
fight back.

1916
02:20:06,598 --> 02:20:07,440
Aslam...

1917
02:20:08,032 --> 02:20:09,272
Rise, Aslam...

1918
02:20:10,835 --> 02:20:14,544
or you will forever fall in the eyes of the one you love.

1919
02:20:46,971 --> 02:20:50,942
Can't you think of any sayings from your line of work...

1920
02:20:52,043 --> 02:20:53,078
tell me, Aslam.

1921
02:21:01,152 --> 02:21:03,564
Look, the love of your life is watching you...

1922
02:21:03,788 --> 02:21:06,394
look at her, bloody coward.

1923
02:21:19,037 --> 02:21:20,038
Aslam...

1924
02:21:34,285 --> 02:21:37,061
Nothing is going to happen to you, Aslam.

1925
02:21:55,139 --> 02:22:01,317
Shohaib... how many more allies do you plan on killing...

1926
02:22:02,547 --> 02:22:04,220
I feel sorry for you...

1927
02:22:04,749 --> 02:22:10,256
you may have the world in your palms,
but even your shadows are averting you.

1928
02:22:11,055 --> 02:22:13,399
You think you are superior to the others...

1929
02:22:14,192 --> 02:22:17,435
I have never come across a more inferior being that you.

1930
02:22:19,631 --> 02:22:23,670
This place, these people and this city...

1931
02:22:23,935 --> 02:22:26,176
and yet, you stand all alone... do you know why?

1932
02:22:27,005 --> 02:22:30,509
Because relationships are formed by feelings... not by force.

1933
02:22:32,010 --> 02:22:34,513
I used to think, no man can be evil...

1934
02:22:35,046 --> 02:22:36,821
but you have proved me wrong.

1935
02:22:37,815 --> 02:22:41,024
I hate you now.

1936
02:22:43,221 --> 02:22:46,532
Go away, leave us alone.

1937
02:22:47,191 --> 02:22:49,637
For God's sake, leave us alone.

1938
02:24:41,439 --> 02:24:45,012
Who claims, that morals are only found in books...

1939
02:24:46,911 --> 02:24:48,549
I managed to hold this city.

1940
02:24:49,347 --> 02:24:53,022
But my heart, slipped out of my hand, like sand.

1941
02:24:54,285 --> 02:24:57,425
I could not even fight and yet, I lost.

1942
02:24:59,057 --> 02:25:00,035
Do you know?

1943
02:25:00,491 --> 02:25:03,904
I used to look at myself in the mirror and secretly, laugh...

1944
02:25:05,496 --> 02:25:09,273
now my fear, taunts me by repeating your name...

1945
02:25:10,902 --> 02:25:13,508
since childhood, this city has given me all of my rights...

1946
02:25:15,239 --> 02:25:20,086
look... it turned it's back when it came to love...

1947
02:25:21,379 --> 02:25:22,881
and people say lam the bad guy.

1948
02:25:24,782 --> 02:25:27,661
If someone were to take you away from me now...

1949
02:25:28,019 --> 02:25:31,091
my pride, will have to accept defeat.

1950
02:25:31,556 --> 02:25:40,442
<i>The conspiracy of love,</i>

1951
02:25:42,066 --> 02:25:50,281
<i>The game of love</i>

1952
02:25:52,510 --> 02:25:57,510
<i>I have lost it all, in the gamble of two hearts</i>

1953
02:26:13,264 --> 02:26:15,767
<i>Why have you made me so lazy</i>

1954
02:26:15,967 --> 02:26:18,379
<i>Why did you stir up feelings in my heart?</i>

1955
02:26:18,536 --> 02:26:20,982
<i>Gave me an abundance of love</i>

1956
02:26:21,172 --> 02:26:23,584
<i>What have you done ?</i>

1957
02:26:23,741 --> 02:26:26,187
<i>I wander without a purpose</i>

1958
02:26:26,377 --> 02:26:28,721
<i>A star away from the moon</i>

1959
02:26:28,980 --> 02:26:31,460
<i>lam lost in love</i>

1960
02:26:31,616 --> 02:26:34,119
<i>What have you done ?</i>

1961
02:26:34,318 --> 02:26:39,267
<i>I have defeated the world and come here,</i>

1962
02:26:39,457 --> 02:26:44,406
<i>Only to lose to you, thus is your effect on me</i>

1963
02:26:44,595 --> 02:26:47,075
<i>Ill tell you the secret of my heart,</i>

1964
02:26:47,231 --> 02:26:49,643
<i>Whenever to breathe</i>

1965
02:26:49,834 --> 02:26:52,212
<i>I say your name</i>

1966
02:26:52,470 --> 02:26:55,212
<i>What have you done ?</i>

1967
02:27:08,553 --> 02:27:14,265
<i>Or my body is addicted to the fragrance of your breath</i>

1968
02:27:14,592 --> 02:27:18,472
<i>I have started living it up a little more</i>

1969
02:27:19,030 --> 02:27:24,742
<i>When the shadow of your eyes fall on the desert of my heart</i>

1970
02:27:24,902 --> 02:27:28,372
<i>I drink a little more to life</i>

1971
02:27:29,106 --> 02:27:34,021
<i>what you mean to me I cannot fathom, but...</i>

1972
02:27:34,345 --> 02:27:39,124
<i>Wherever I go, Its only you I mention</i>

1973
02:27:39,417 --> 02:27:41,863
<i>I have a feeling you will accept my love</i>

1974
02:27:42,053 --> 02:27:44,363
<i>Seems like this battle I have won</i>

1975
02:27:44,655 --> 02:27:47,033
<i>I feel rejuvenated</i>

1976
02:27:47,191 --> 02:27:49,603
<i>What have you done?</i>

1977
02:27:49,827 --> 02:27:52,205
<i>Ill tell you the secret of my heart,</i>

1978
02:27:52,463 --> 02:27:54,773
<i>Whenever to breathe</i>

1979
02:27:55,099 --> 02:27:57,511
<i>I say your name</i>

1980
02:27:57,702 --> 02:28:00,182
<i>What have you done?</i>

1981
02:28:11,215 --> 02:28:14,253
<i>My heart wants to listen to you speak</i>

1982
02:28:14,452 --> 02:28:16,898
<i>It's a raw deal I made</i>

1983
02:28:17,188 --> 02:28:20,465
<i>A profit without aninvestment</i>

1984
02:28:21,626 --> 02:28:24,664
<i>Why should I ruin myself?</i>

1985
02:28:24,896 --> 02:28:27,137
<i>Sacrifice myself for you</i>

1986
02:28:27,498 --> 02:28:31,503
<i>Strange are the rules of love</i>

1987
02:28:31,736 --> 02:28:36,617
<i>Now that our paths have crossed</i>

1988
02:28:36,874 --> 02:28:41,687
<i>I have decided to tread on it carefree</i>

1989
02:28:41,979 --> 02:28:44,459
<i>Tell me, whose permission I need</i>

1990
02:28:44,649 --> 02:28:47,095
<i>Tell me, should a request be made</i>

1991
02:28:47,218 --> 02:28:49,596
<i>My smiles now seem so fake</i>

1992
02:28:49,820 --> 02:28:52,494
<i>What have you done?</i>
