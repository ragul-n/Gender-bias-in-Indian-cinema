00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,520
'All characters in this
movie speak in Tamil...'

2
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,520
'...for the understanding
of Tamil people'

3
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,200
Hello dear friends!

4
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,640
We welcome you to the today’s
episode of Aayudha Ezhuthu

5
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,120
We are going to discuss about an
important topic in today’s program

6
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,240
'An injured head is found
at India-Pakistan border'

7
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:06,240
In Kashmir border, two military
soldiers were found beheaded and dead

8
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,040
This incident which has caused agony
and turmoil all over the country is

9
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,480
Not happening for
the first time or the last time!

10
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,640
These incidents continue to happen
frequently at the border!

11
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,120
The border security
personnel deployed at the border...

12
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,840
...who undertake vigorous
security measures to safeguard

13
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,760
Our country lose their precious lives...

14
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,840
...or sometimes disappear in
mysterious circumstances frequently

15
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:32,040
We are going to discuss about this
issue in today’s Aayudha Ezhuthu program!

16
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,840
We have with us, retired
Major Mr Madhan Gandhi!

17
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,440
Greetings!

18
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,960
Also, we have Human Rights
activist Mr Chandra Mohan with us!

19
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Central Government Attorney
Mr Rajan MP Nathan joins us!

20
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,720
I would like to ask my first question to

21
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,760
At the border

22
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,800
If a military personnel is killed
or his eyes extorted or beheaded

23
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,200
We say it is because of terrorists!

24
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,880
When the security forces personnel
goes missing all of a sudden

25
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,400
What is the reasoning behind this?

26
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,320
When a Jawan or an Officer goes
missing from a force

27
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,880
If it is featured in news

28
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,200
It affects our army!

29
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,920
And also affects our country
as well and that is their aim

30
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,320
If something happens toa
soldier at the border

31
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,880
What is the reason that we ignore
and treat the incident as habitual?

32
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,840
It has become customary

33
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:17,000
If someone joins the army,
it is his duty to die!

34
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,440
We just speak of their sacrifice...!

35
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,560
What did our country do?

36
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,240
How many of them are beheaded?

37
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,720
How many were missing?

38
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,080
What has happened until now?

39
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,120
If these incidents continue to happen...!

40
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,240
What does the central
government accomplish?

41
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,680
Will this question surface or not?

42
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:35,880
The news which should be investigated
is termed as Invisible Enemies in English!

43
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,200
If a soldier is killed at the border...

44
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:43,920
...you assume that he should have been
killed by the soldier of another country!

45
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,640
But that is not a finest
intelligence report!

46
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,840
Sir, you might be aware

47
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:51,040
This happens frequently at the
border on a daily basis!

48
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,120
No one can disappear from the Army

49
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,920
This is not black magic!

50
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,200
They may go missing!

51
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,520
Major...! I differ...!

52
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,000
Is he a five year old kid to go missing?

53
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,560
You talk as if they got here
normally and went missing!

54
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,440
What I am trying
to say Major...In Army...!

55
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:11,720
Were there no incidents of
soldiers missing reported earlier?

56
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,840
It has happened!

57
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,400
If someone stays stealthily!

58
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:18,400
There are chances
for this at the border

59
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,040
It doesn't happen regularly

60
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,800
Once in the way...a social activist
cannot use this as a weapon

61
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:29,360
Once in the way once in the blue man once
in the Accidentally...incidentally...

62
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,960
You should not bring all these here

63
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:36,840
The Sovereignty of the India’s integrity
and righteous approach is in Military

64
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,280
The debate continues...!

65
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,080
Most recently, a border
security personnel

66
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,400
From Tamil Nadu has gone missing!

67
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,000
He is Vasu from Sevarakkottai
village of Sivaganga District!

68
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,400
Let us listen to what Vasu’s
family has to say about this!

69
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,960
It has been one and half
months since I spoke to my son

70
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,720
I want to see him somehow!

71
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,480
Someone please do something! Officers...!

72
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,600
I request and pray to you!

73
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,920
The authorities are answerable to this

74
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,320
Vasu should come back!

75
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,880
The army should safeguard people!

76
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,040
Who is a responsible if an
army man has no security?

77
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,360
Where is missing Vasu?

78
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,520
Is he alive, kidnapped or...!

79
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:19,280
Will his head be thrown
at the border, someday?

80
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,760
We have lot of questions!

81
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,680
Let us keep searching for the answers!

82
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:44,080
CHIKAR MILITARY PRISON (PAKISTAN)

83
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,560
'ZAHEER ABBAS
Major, 24th Battalion, Pakistan Army'

84
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,160

Major, 24th Battalion, Pakistan Army'

85
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,120

86
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,720
'Major General, 24th Battalion,
Pakistan Army'

87
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,400
Dog!

88
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,720
To me, all of you Indian sin
a way are same

89
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,280
You have no language for yourselves!

90
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,720
You have no religion for yourselves!

91
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:05,000
You wave your tail for
the bone that is thrown from Delhi

92
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,800
You join the army for mere salary!

93
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,120
But one language

94
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,840
One religion

95
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,280
One country

96
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,640
Our country!

97
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,360
We do not lose even a part
of our country to the enemy

98
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,360
You chase our people in the border

99
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,000
Do you know?
What is the retaliation for that?

100
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,880
Your head!

101
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:32,200
When we behead your heads and throw...!

102
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:37,440
Each one in the border security force
should repent joining the army in fear

103
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,880
He should at least take ten steps back!

104
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,880
Your border will shrink!

105
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,000
Our border will expand!

106
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:49,040
The day Kashmir becoming a part
of Pakistan is not far away!

107
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,840
Those who want to escape from
this place should know this!

108
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,160
If you have come here,
you will die here

109
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,600
You can never escape from this place

110
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,880
Who should be killed subsequently...!

111
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,800
Will be decided by me!

112
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:09,800
Are you curious to know
who is going to be beheaded today?

113
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,240
Sir!

114
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:24,360
Those who are here should
have strength in your body!

115
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,920
Those who have stamina may survive!

116
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,240
If not...die!

117
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,680
Kill him!

'The reason is...'

'He is perfect in all aspects!'

the National flag then!'

'He was very keen to go to 8th grade'

00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,760
"We do not have a good name tag!"

179
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,880
"But we are genuinely good!"

180
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:44,880
"Do not detach any nail!"

181
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:51,280
"Not even one!"

182
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,360
"We are aging!"

183
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,800
"Times are changing!"

184
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,600
"Arrogance towering!"

185
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,840
"When touched, see it bursts!"

186
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,120
"Didn’t search for money!"

187
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,200
"Affection is adequate!"

188
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,400
"We do not live in guise!"

189
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,280
"No need to be in pride!"

190
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:49,400
"The Nail...! The Nail!"

191
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,040
"Do not detach any nail!"

192
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:59,400
"Not even one!"

193
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,760
'Though my brother and I
roam around together...'

194
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,200
'...in NCC, school, college
and temple...!'

195
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,880
'We can never walk together in this street
where my home is located'

196
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:30,280
'The reason is my father Meiyappan
and my uncle Azhagappan!'

197
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,760
'They have a long pending feud!'

198
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,600
'They fight for the same name'

199
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:38,960
'Because, they are in the same business!'

200
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,640
'Both their provision stores are
located facing each other’s'

201
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,680
'Welcome! Always quarrel!'

202
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,480
'You shouldn’t prosper!'

203
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,440
'Though they both always quarrel,
both my brother and I...!'

204
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,240
No dad

205
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,680
Do you want a college
student to sell Jaggery?

206
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,640
I can’t!

207
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,000
You should learn how to run
the shop from tomorrow!

208
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,120
We should expand our shop and
make it bigger than his shop

209
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,920
After our graduation, they made us
take charge of our respective shops

210
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,280
Not today! Tomorrow!

211
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,520
Dad...What is this?

212
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,560
I am going to the movie!

213
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,440
Only the two of us!

214
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,680
Do you understand?

215
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,720
What do you want?
Eggs?

216
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,720
What life is this?

217
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,040
Why did we earn a degree for
sitting amidst these gunny bags?

218
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,160
Leave it Vasu...!

219
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,480
This misery will last
only for few more days

220
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,480
Only for few more days?

221
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,400
We are going to Kashmir!

222
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,360
We are going!

223
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:11,360
Enough of our difficulties
in this hot barren land!

224
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,480
We are going to Kashmir!

225
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,240
Whole of Kashmir is Air conditioned!

226
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,280
One should sleep with blankets
even in the month of May!

227
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,680
That's fine

228
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,560
Why do we go to Kashmir?

229
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,840
To start a provision store?

230
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,800
Leave that Vasu
We are joining the army!

231
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,440
Get lost!

232
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,160
It won’t suit us!

233
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,440
We may have to fight war with guns!

234
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,280
Idiot! Does war happens often?

235
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,440
It is occasional!

236
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,800
There was a war in 1971!

237
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,800
Kargil war happened in the year 1999!

238
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,800
What did they do in between these years?

239
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:47,120
Had good food, explored
Kashmir and took rest!

240
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,240
Even if war happens, we should avail
our leave and come back to our village

241
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,280
That is a government job, isn't?

242
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,320
I am going to tell you an
important matter, Listen!

243
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,080
How many departments are
there in the Government?

244
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,880
Are they providing liquor to
any of those departments?

245
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,120
Giving!

246
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,840
Military have the glory that
no other department possesses!

247
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,200
Government pays our salary
and also supply liquor!

248
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,840
'He will get me trapped
in war for a beer!'

249
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:15,320
For chilled beer, we roam
around many shops here

250
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,600
We get liquor anytime in military!

251
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,640
With subsidised rates!

252
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,120
Super! How do you know all these?

253
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,920
If I was active in NCC,
I would have known these too!

254
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,600
No...! I did not learn this in NCC!

255
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,480
How many shocks are you going
to give me in one night?

256
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,240
I am going to tell you a truth! Listen!

257
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,440
The photo with garland in
our home, Nagappa Uncle!

258
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,920
He is still alive

259
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,360
He is in BSF!

260
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,880
Is he still alive?

261
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,720
Yes

262
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:50,400
So we are going to join BSF
and meet uncle Nagappa!

263
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,040
He is my mentor

264
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,240
I will travel in his path

265
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,880
Now, I am your mentor

266
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,960
You should travel in the path which I show!

267
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,280
We may start anytime
Be ready!

268
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,120
Boss...Go ahead!

269
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,720
Why do you fear?
This is just an eye wash!

270
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,880
Come

271
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,480
Where do look and run?

272
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,240
If you run like this,
you will not be selected at all

273
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,960
Don't get tense!

274
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,600
Uncle Nagappa would have made a call!

275
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,000
Is everything what you said is true?

276
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,240
What...? The occasional wars!

277
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,600
Let it happen anytime!

278
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,920
You were telling me that
liquor is accessible anytime?

279
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,440
What is your doubt on that?

280
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,960
'He questions very often?'

281
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,760
Shall I confirm this with that man?

282
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,720
To whom?

283
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:58,800
Sir!

284
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,720
Yes!

285
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,920
Please come here!

286
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,120
I have a small doubt!

287
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,360
For him!

288
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,160
What is his doubt?

289
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,120
Why does the policeman interview people?

290
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,480
He is a BSF officer!

291
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,760
Not that!

292
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,080
Will you please keep quiet?

293
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,240
But he is wearing khaki’s?

294
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,240
We use Khaki uniform in office
and use green in the field!

295
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,560
What is this?

296
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,560
For height?

297
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,160
Heroes who act with Anushka (actress)
use this to match height! Oh!

298
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,480
Oh!

299
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,360
Come on! Come on!

300
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,200
Is this not too much for you?

301
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,080
Be patient! Let’s first confirm Kashmir!

302
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,160
Next?

303
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,040
Sir, one minute

304
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,880
Sir!

305
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,560
Sir, did Nagappan give a call?

306
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,560
Who is Nagappan?

307
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,640
He is a BSF officer like you!

308
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,120
He will definitely give a call

309
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,520
I was born to become military personnel

310
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,720
I am fit!

311
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:02,840
My brother who stands behind
is new to the ground!

312
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,640
I am Nagappa’s brother’s son
He is related too!

313
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,920
Please take him in this too

314
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:08,600
Go man...!

315
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,880
Go and stand in the queue!

316
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,360
Thank you, sir

317
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,280
Ok

318
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,560
Next

319
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,160
Wait!

320
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:18,840
Sir!

321
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,840
Remove your shoes!

322
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,840
Why sir?

323
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,640
Are you here to dance with Anushka?

324
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,840
- Sir!
- Remove your shoes!

325
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,680
Sir...Please sir!

326
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,680
Remove your shoes!

327
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,960
Look at him and his style!

328
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:27,880
Go!

329
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,120
How tall?

330
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,280
Stand properly!

331
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,640
- Raju...Come here!
- Sir!

332
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,960
Sir...! Just a minute sir!

333
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,760
Could you please confirm
whether Nagappa gave a call?

334
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,640
42

335
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,720
In expanded posture!

336
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,760
Chest in expanded posture!

337
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,840
Pazhani, Kashmir confirmed!

338
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,440
We shall drink chilled
beer lying naked on ice!

339
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,920
Not possible!

340
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:06,920
Why?

341
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,200
I was ready to safeguard the
country from terrorists!

342
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,880
Than safeguarding
the country from terrorists...

343
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,520
...saving it from you
people is a big deal

344
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,360
Go!

345
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,800
He feels a lot!

346
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,360
Get lost!

347
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,280
Do everything that will degenerate you!

348
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:34,360
Do not shout just as you do in shop

349
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,960
It is his wish
Let him go!

350
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,480
Vasu!

351
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,600
Come on!

352
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,440
Come!

353
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,960
Stand facing the east!

354
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,360
Frontier deity!
Please take care of my son!

355
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,280
- Raise your shirt!
- Mom!

356
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,040
- Lift it!
- Why do you do all these?

357
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,040
This is for your well being!

358
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,520
He would have prospered
if it is tied in his 6 years!

359
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,520
What is the use now?

360
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,880
This is the string of God
that is equal to life!

361
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:00,000
Nothing will possess you
Do not remove this in any situation!

362
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,280
Nothing will possess you
Do not remove this in any situation!

363
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,480
You can live like a king
if you take care of the shop!

364
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,800
King? Does a King lift gunny bags?

365
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,360
Leave
Let him be

366
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,160
Are you really going to Bangalore
for training or explore the city?

367
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,600
Sister...! This room is for you from now!

368
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,400
What is this?

369
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,760
Is he going on exile?

370
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,720
He is going to be in
any one of the cities!

371
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,080
We are destined to be here!

372
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:28,360
Listen! If there is any
difficulty, you should not suffer

373
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,600
You should come back to your mother!

374
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,320
I am leaving!

375
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:42,600
BANGALORE TRAINING CAMP

376
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:52,360
AFTER 38 WEEK TRAINING!
INDIA - PAKISTAN BORDER

377
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,480
The most dangerous border of the world!

378
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,080
Is the place where
you are standing!

379
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:10,360
And the most costly place of India!

380
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,080
Yes

381
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,120
To safeguard this place...!
Our government spends many crores yearly!

382
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,000
For what?

383
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,360
This is our country’s honour!

384
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,040
After all with the man power of 5
lakhs 50 thousand, Pakistan combats

385
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,640
With our country which has
1.1 million man power?

386
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,880
The reason is this land!

387
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:29,080
It is your duty to safeguard
the honour of India hereafter

388
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,440
Proud to be our self

389
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,480
Because nobody can get this chance

390
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,520
You are all lucky

391
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,880
Get ready to prove your
love our country

392
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,240
Go...!

393
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,880
Wake up...wake up

394
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,280
The loon is coming!

395
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,160
From which world is he from?

396
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,080
Vasu!

397
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,720
Come on! Come on!

398
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,880
INTERNATIONAL BORDER

399
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:06,200
PAKISTAN-INDIA

400
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:14,120
'People did not join the army with the
intension of safeguarding the country'

401
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,720
'It is because, men who are angry
with their dad just like me!'

402
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:17,720
'No!'

403
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,720
'Who couldn’t pay the debt of their father'

404
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,000
'There are a lot of people
who have joined...'

405
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,400
'...this job only in the interest
of their families...!'

406
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,880
'When I left my village,'

407
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:29,480
'I was so happy that I am going
to a make it big in life!'

408
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:34,280
'I had no idea that I am going
to be alone at the top!'

409
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:37,720
'I wanted to join a job
that has no difficulties!'

410
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:41,240
'But holding a gun and sitting idle'

411
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:46,760
'And simply staring the glaciers
is the toughest job I suppose!'

412
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,320
'If I had known the nature
of this job earlier'

413
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,640
'I would have never opted for this at all!'

414
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,040
'Without meeting people!'

415
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,160
'Working for two three
days in the same place!'

416
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,520
'Is cruel!'

417
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,960
'Loneliness! Loneliness! Loneliness!'

418
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,160
'Creates sorrow in me!'

419
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,280
'And I cannot share this with anybody!'

420
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,760
'That leads to frustration!'

421
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,880
'Only till the river flows, it is
potable and can be used by people'

422
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:20,600
'If it is stagnated, it starts stinking!'

423
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,200
'My life is the same now!'

424
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,520
'It has stagnated in one place
And become a gutter'

425
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:29,320
'Loneliness, sadness, frustration
started pestering my brain!'

426
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:34,560
'I have escaped from my dad and
confined in deep distress of life'

427
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,040
'This is the end of the road'

428
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,280
'There is no way after this!'

429
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,560
'Would like to go back to my village!'

430
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,000
'When life went on in
its usual routines...!'

431
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,360
'One day!'

432
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,640
Brother! What happened?

433
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:59,880
Muscle torn and sags!
You don’t seem to be bothered!

434
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,240
What happened?

435
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:13,120
Beyond the check post, on the Salamabad
route a girl came running suddenly!

436
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,040
For a minute...!

437
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,520
I was completely gone!

438
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,320
But my life has just arrived!

439
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:48,400
'I had nothing in my mind till yesterday!'

440
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,120
'But after she arrived!'

441
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,640
There is no place in it!

442
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,640
'The void in my life was'

443
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,600
'Filled with contentment!'

444
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,600
'Though I am surrounded by snow'

445
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,320
'My heart was in storm!'

446
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,720
'Feel like laughing at
this strange feeling!'

447
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,640
'Didn’t know what happened to me!'

448
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,640
'But I knew that something has happened!'

449
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,040
'If I happen to see her
again, I will stay there'

450
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,320
'If not!'

451
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:29,480
"Something! Something! Something!"

452
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:32,440
"Happens in me!"

453
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:38,720
"Deep within! Deep within! Heart longs!"

454
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:41,760
"Glaciers in all directions!"

455
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,640
"Why volcanoes in me?"

456
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:47,400
"You have crossed once!"

457
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:50,280
"I’m dissolved many a times!"

458
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:53,000
"For a second, you make me...you make me"

459
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:56,680
"Inclined as wind!"

460
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:08,320
"You are magical! You are magical!"

461
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,920
Ruhi!

462
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,280
Come on! Come on!

463
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:23,240
"You are magical!"

464
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,600
Two Lavas please!

465
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,600
Thank you

466
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,480
Kanoam!

467
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,400
Kanoam!

468
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,080
Kanoam!

469
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:44,920
What is Kanoam?

470
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,760
Her name!

471
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,600
But for me, she is Kajal!

472
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:59,280
"Shall we live as strangers?"

473
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:02,280
"You are me! I am you!"

474
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,040
"Shall we unite?"

475
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,200
"Will I be here?"

476
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,680
"Will I give life?"

477
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,760
"Do I love you?"

478
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,880
"Will I conquer you with love?"

479
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,280
"Will I marry you?"

480
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,440
"Do I wait eternally?"

481
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:19,600
"Will this too pass?"

482
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:22,400
"Will the heart overcome this?"

483
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:26,840
"Heart is melting!"

484
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:37,760
"You are magical! You are magical!"

485
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:34,400
"The same day! The same day!"

486
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:37,360
"Should prolong in my life!"

487
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:40,080
"Likewise! Likewise!"

488
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:43,040
"I should walk with you!"

489
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,040
"Be the air you breathe!"

490
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:48,760
"I should become your breeze
and Unite in your life!"

491
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,800
"To the home you sleep"

492
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:54,520
"I should become a wall
And gaze at you!"

493
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:57,480
"Will this too pass?"

494
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:00,360
"Will the heart overcome this?"

495
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:05,000
"Heart is melting!"

496
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:23,160
"You are magical! You are magical!"

497
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,400
Check point 14 calling

498
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,120
Emergency!

499
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,520
Fence break! Over!

500
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,880
Yes sir!

501
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:07,800
What were you doing?

502
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,280
The lamb was grazing here and when
it crossed the fence, they shot!

503
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,720
What were you doing?

504
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,920
Is this how you execute your duty?

505
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,400
You could have stopped the
lamb from moving this far?

506
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,680
It was a lamb
and I thought they won’t fire!

507
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,960
Listen! They do not differentiate
between lamb and men!

508
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,400
They will fire if anything crosses the fence!

509
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:23,360
To show compassion and be considerate,
they are not Indians!

510
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,280
Be careful

511
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,000
Yes sir!

512
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,040
Picket 89!

513
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,080
Damaged fence!

514
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,720
Inform Nagappan immediately!

515
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,240
Nagappan uncle

516
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,440
Uncle

517
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:53,600
Uncle! I am Vasu
Your brother's son

518
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,680
I know...I know

519
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,600
What is this Uncle?

520
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,120
We meet after so many years?
You don't seem to be happy at all

521
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,760
Do you want me to hug
you and show my affection?

522
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,240
Your dad betrayed me

523
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,120
I did not want to
meet you people and

524
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,040
that's why did not come
home for all these years

525
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:11,800
And continue to live in Kashmir
alone in spite of danger and hardship

526
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,520
Wait! What did I ask you now?

527
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,440
I just asked whether
you are happy at seeing me?

528
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,480
Is that wrong?

529
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,680
Why do you burst like this?

530
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,240
Yes, I am not happy

531
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,240
Move

532
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,360
Brother told me that,

533
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,520
Uncle would be
angry till he meets us

534
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,720
But, he will shower his love
on us as soon as he meets us

535
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,640
But, you are not that type

536
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,000
I left home and live
a helpless life here

537
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,400
I was happy that
I have a father figure here

538
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,520
It is my fault! My fault!

539
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,880
Son

540
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:45,080
Wait
Wait

541
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,280
Come on

542
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,800
Uncle you are just the
same type as brother said

543
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,200
Come on

544
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:49,600
Do not think bad of your uncle
for drinking while on duty

545
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,240
What else do you want me to do?

546
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,520
When I go near that fence,
I become nervous

547
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,080
I start shivering

548
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:00,760
One day in tension,
I kept my leg in their territory

549
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,160
I drink this to gain courage

550
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:08,480
I am not a habitual drinker
I drink in fear

551
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,040
Don't look at me like this

552
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:16,600
One day a man went to mend
the fence in Gurez sector

553
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,720
...his thumb is not found
when he returned

554
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,840
When asked,

555
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:23,440
...he said his cutting player fell on the
other side, he placed his hand they fired

556
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,720
The fool left his thumb in Pakistan...

557
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,400
...and brought back the
cutting player to India

558
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,880
Stay vigilant and be careful

559
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:33,120
To which camp do you belong?

560
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,760
Frontier four Baramullah

561
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,200
Okay! I will come and
meet you when I am free

562
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,800
Stay safe

563
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,360
- Jawan
- Yes sir

564
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:46,040
The name of the operation
to be executed tomorrow is

565
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:46,960
Snake Bite

566
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
This is a training program

567
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:50,960
If terrorists enter village
and mingle among them

568
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,720
How do we attack and
capture them is what

569
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,240
...we are going to do
in this operation tomorrow

570
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,680
The operation is headed
by our SI at Salamabad

571
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,920
Start

572
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,840
Only the four of you
I choose are the terrorists

573
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:04,800
You are going to enter
the houses of the villagers

574
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,080
- Naseer
- Yes sir

575
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,520
- Vasu
- Yes sir

576
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,240
- Vishal Reddy
- Yes sir

577
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,840
- Jojan Thomas
- Yes sir

578
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,760
- All Jawans ready?
- Yes sir

579
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,200
Mr Mohammed Malik

580
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:17,360
Receive all of them at
your respective homes tomorrow

581
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,240
Okay

582
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,640
Vasu

583
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,160
Kanoam
Kanoam

584
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,320
Come here for a minute

585
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,200
I'm coming

586
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,200
- Come on
- What?

587
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:02,320
Terrorists have entered our village

588
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,080
What do you say?

589
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:05,040
Yes, the army personnel have come

590
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,720
Is it true?

591
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,120
What happened?

592
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:12,040
Somebody is in

593
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,080
Wait I will come

594
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,720
Come soon! Come soon!

595
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,000
Where? Where?

596
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,200
Look there

597
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,440
You go that side

598
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,560
Nobody is found
There?

599
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:31,000
Kanoam, Come here!
He is here

600
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,600
Hold his hand

601
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,960
He is trying to escape

602
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:38,720
Tie his leg

603
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,720
He is taking his gun

604
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,040
Hold his leg!
I am!

605
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,600
Kanoam, Come on! Come on!

606
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:48,720
Don't run! Stop!

607
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,800
Catch him
Catch him!

608
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,200
Are you trying to escape?

609
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,880
Everybody come out

610
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,840
We have captured the terrorist
We have captured the terrorist

611
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:57,800
Come on

612
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:00,120
- Stop! Stop it!
- Come faster

613
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:03,520
Very good girl
One should be like this

614
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:06,160
If terrorists enter home,
you should act like this

615
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,320
But, he is not a terrorist

616
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:10,440
He is a BSF Jawan and
this is a training program

617
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:12,880
Are you a Jawan?

618
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,520
What did I say and what did you do?

619
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:15,640
Remove your mask

620
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,200
Idiot

621
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:30,440
Come on guys

622
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:37,960
Jawan ji

623
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:00,120
Tell me

624
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,640
You know my dad

625
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,280
Your grandfather

626
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:05,200
He has two wives

627
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:09,600
Your dad and his brother
were born to his second wife

628
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:11,280
Everyone knows that

629
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:13,840
Your dad was afraid of me that,

630
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:16,640
I may come and claim
a share in the property some day

631
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:20,000
Therefore, he conspired and
chased me out of the village

632
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:26,800
Yes, I was very fond of Torino
in my childhood

633
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:27,920
What was that?

634
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:32,120
It is a soft drink like Miranda,
Fanta and Coco cola

635
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,800
I used to drink that a
lot from a shop nearby...

636
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:37,920
...my school and had to
pay 500 rupees for that

637
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:41,320
The shopkeeper kept chasing me
for that amount

638
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:43,640
You dad came to know about this and
summoned me

639
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:48,240
He said that he will give me 500 rupees
and demanded signature on a paper

640
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:50,400
Do you know
what did he write on it?

641
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:57,320
I was not born to my dad and I should not
use his name as my initials

642
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:01,680
500 rupees was more important to me
than my dad's initials then

643
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:03,120
Therefore, I signed

644
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:05,600
The villagers came to
know this and teased me...

645
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:10,440
...saying that I sold my
initials for just 500 rupees

646
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:15,120
Unable to tolerate the humiliation,
I left the village

647
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,720
Leave that uncle

648
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:22,480
I think you are high

649
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:24,160
I haven't started drinking yet

650
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,600
You finished half of the bottle

651
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:31,040
- Uncle
- What?

652
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:32,640
The hip band which is tied by
my mom is not found

653
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:35,760
Not found?

654
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:37,160
What is the noise?

655
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:43,240
His hip band is missing
in today's operation

656
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:46,520
I suspect it should be
somewhere here

657
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:47,920
Why do you come here and shout?

658
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:50,120
Who is he?
You could have come in the morning?

659
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:53,960
That was given to me by
my mom! It is precious!

660
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,760
I won't sleep and eat
without that band

661
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,560
Correct! There are a lot of strings
in Tamil Nadu like this

662
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,880
There are three
important among those

663
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:04,560
Umbilical cord

664
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:06,720
Nuptial knot and,

665
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:08,880
The hip band

666
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:12,800
Everybody listen carefully

667
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:16,560
If someone has taken his band,
please return

668
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,640
If you cheat,
you will vomit blood and die

669
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:23,440
It is that powerful

670
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:25,520
It will come now

671
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:27,360
Go! Go!

672
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:31,840
This is a kind of technique
May look childish but you will get it

673
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:33,760
Oh God!

674
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,280
They threaten of blood vomiting

675
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:38,840
I am afraid

676
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:40,760
Uncle, come on

677
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:44,600
I knew you must have taken it

678
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:53,040
My friend is good
She did not take it intentionally

679
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:54,600
That's alright! That's alright!

680
00:46:58,840 --> 00:46:59,720
Keep telling

681
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:02,200
Nothing will happen to her, right?

682
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:03,440
No...No

683
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:05,480
Anything may happen

684
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:07,040
It will happen

685
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:08,520
Little girl

686
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:12,640
What is the remedy?
Please tell me

687
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:14,560
I will ask her to do

688
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:19,560
Remedy!
Yes!

689
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:21,800
But, the little girl
cannot perform that

690
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:23,560
You should do

691
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:24,400
Me?

692
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:25,720
Sinner

693
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:27,680
What should I do?

694
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:29,000
Hold this

695
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:32,440
You should tie this

696
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,320
Oh!
I cannot do this!

697
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:35,480
Son!

698
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,400
They may tie us here
like they do the horses

699
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,560
Let them uncle
Let her tie this first

700
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:41,160
Tie it...Tie it

701
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:42,880
Your friend will vomit blood

702
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:44,560
Please! Please!

703
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:47,120
Okay, I will tie

704
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:49,560
Son!
Please don't

705
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:52,240
Nothing will happen
to my friend, right?

706
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:58,800
No

707
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:03,760
That's alright!
I was kidding!

708
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:06,480
Nothing will happen to your friend

709
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:07,480
Go

710
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:25,080
Mom

711
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:25,920
Vasu

712
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,720
- How are you?
- I am fine, Mom

713
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:29,120
Your friends
Are they doing well?

714
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:31,360
What do you say, Rotti or Reddy?
Are they fine?

715
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:32,280
Yes, they are

716
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:34,040
The officer, cook?

717
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:36,320
Driver, cleaner, security, gardener,

718
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:38,640
...the one who Irons
clothes everybody are fine

719
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:39,840
Why are you shouting?

720
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:42,760
Only if people surrounded by
you are fine, you will be good too

721
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:43,640
Okay! Tell me!

722
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:46,240
How long am I asking you to
send me your photo with uniform?

723
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:47,720
I haven't taken a photo with uniform

724
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,720
Broker Ponnusamy keeps asking me

725
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,000
I want your photo by this week,
keep that in mind

726
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:03,880
What?

727
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,320
What is that son?

728
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:12,560
What are you staring at the
sky lying on the rock?

729
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:13,920
Are you missing your mom?

730
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:14,760
Yes

731
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:16,800
I was thinking about mom

732
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:20,160
She gives a call daily and wants
me to send my photo

733
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:21,400
She just wants your photo?

734
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,440
Why don't you send her one?

735
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:25,040
I will send

736
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:27,120
Why do you say so as if you are
going to send a bomb

737
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:28,040
Yes uncle,

738
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:29,880
I am going to send a bomb

739
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:30,960
Tell me clearly

740
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,800
My mom wants my photo to
find a girl for me

741
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:37,520
What if I send the girl's photo
who I like instead of mine?

742
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:40,200
Whether it is a bomb to
your mom or not,

743
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:42,080
It will be a bomb
to your dad for sure

744
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:42,960
That's it

745
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:44,760
What are you doing now, uncle

746
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:45,560
This evening

747
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:48,840
Get a good photographer and come to the
village we went to yesterday

748
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,760
- The hip band girl?
- Yes

749
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:51,840
No my son

750
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:55,400
The area is dangerous and the
people are too worse

751
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:58,520
That is why one should not
drink with older people

752
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:00,520
You start advising very soon

753
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:02,560
No! This won't suit your life

754
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:05,040
Uncle, only if it suits
will I ever get a life

755
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:06,200
That's why

756
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:07,680
It's not that

757
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:08,760
Do no talk unnecessarily

758
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:11,920
Bring a photographer to the
village at seven O' clock sharp

759

(Famous Hindi Song)

760
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:42,840
What happened?

761
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:45,600
She looks gorgeous in
kashmiri dress, uncle

762
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:47,840
Must be of make up

763
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,560
Okay! Go! Go!

764
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,160
Where is the photographer?

765
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:54,040
Here he is! Come on!

766
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,560
- What is this uncle?
- He will take

767
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:58,560
Start! Lift it and take a picture

768
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:01,720
Did you see how he
managed to take that?

769
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:03,280
You go ahead

770
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:04,640
Give it

771
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:07,760
Come fast

(Famous Hindi Songs)

774
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:00,720
My granddaughter

(Famous Hindi Songs)

776
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:40,520
Jawan sir

777
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:43,320
Why are you hiding looking at me?
Why do you smile at me?

778
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:46,320
Nothing of that sort

779
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:49,120
I just came here to
ask you something

780
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:50,400
Ask me?

781
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:52,000
What?

782
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:55,600
Your photo

783
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:57,520
What did you ask?

784
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:01,240
No! I just came
here to talk to you

785
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:02,760
Tell me

786
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:08,920
I am Vasu

787
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:10,760
Vasu

788
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:14,160
- My name...
- Kanoam! I know!

789
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,160
But, Kajal for me

790
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:19,480
You danced well last night

791
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:22,560
Your dance was just alright

792
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:24,760
You have ruined

793
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,840
You seized the snake courageously

794
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:29,680
You were just alright seizing it

795
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:38,480
She is stunning, Vasu

796
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:39,840
you would have missed

797
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:41,800
What have you missed?

798
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:44,760
I was talking about this village

799
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,120
It is too beautiful

800
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:48,480
But I did not like it
when I came here

801
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:50,240
I regretted coming here

802
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:55,200
I was in confusion whether
I should stay here or leave

803
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:58,120
Then, I somehow stayed here

804
00:53:58,160 --> 00:53:59,760
Why so much confusion?

805
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:03,280
If you didn't like,
you could have left already?

806
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:09,920
Just for a second, do what your
heart and mind tells you

807
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:11,800
You will be happy

808
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:16,920
Instead, if u keep adjusting
You will never be happy in your life

809
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:17,680
Hello

810
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:19,400
I do not adjust here and live

811
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:20,760
I am living happily

812
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:22,760
Much happier

813
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:24,600
What happiness?

814
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:28,240
She come and fell
on the trap herself

815
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:29,360
Tell her Vasu

816
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:31,040
What are you going to say?

817
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:54,320
"I feel like telling you"

818
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:55,800
"By looking at your eyes"

819
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:59,440
"I gaze without telling"

820
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:02,200
"I want to fetch you,"

821
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:03,920
"When I come near you"

822
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:07,320
"I shower in fear"

823
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:11,480
"Your eyes speak volumes"

824
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:15,400
"I become speechless"

825
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:19,640
"Just as the swing,
That oscillates front and back"

826
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:23,480
"My love wanders here and there"

827
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,800
"I feel like telling you"

828
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:27,160
"By looking at your eyes"

829
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:30,760
"I gaze without telling"

830
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:33,680
"I want to fetch you,"

831
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:35,120
"When I come near you"

832
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:38,360
"I shower in fear"

833
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:52,040
- Okay, I am leaving
- Just a minute

834
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:55,880
Nothing! Go ahead!

835
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:14,320
"When love is disclosed
The love ends there"

836
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:17,960
"If not disclosed
It lives in one's heart"

837
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,800
"Dwells in my tongue
Words never end"

838
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:26,360
"Like the droplet of honey,
that sleeps in a flower"

839
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:30,120
"On my behalf, the air
will tell about my love"

840
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:33,840
"Your love will be
disclosed to me by the sky"

841
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:36,000
"Dear swan, Goldie"

842
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:38,240
"Language is not
necessary to reveal love"

843
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:40,640
"I feel like telling you"

844
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:42,200
"By looking at your eyes"

845
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:46,200
"I gaze without telling"

846
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:21,400
"The aroma of your top"

847
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:24,840
"Speak volumes about everything"

848
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:28,760
"The part which is not touched,
Build fire in heart"

849
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:33,320
"That compels to
perform unsolicited deeds"

850
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:37,240
"Ought to disclose tomorrow,"

851
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:40,760
"It has become months"

852
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:45,080
"At any moment,
The bud will bloom"

853
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:47,720
"I feel like telling you"

854
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:50,120
"By looking at your eyes
After that, I left"

855
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:55,160
"I gaze without telling"

856
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:56,160
Kajal!

857
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:58,240
Can you please stay
for some more time?

858
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:00,320
Some more time?
For how long?

859
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:05,200
The whole day?

860
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:08,240
The whole year?

861
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:17,440
Stay with me for the
whole life Kajal

862
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:49,800
Jojo!

863
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:51,600
One minute! I will come!

864
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:52,800
Leave that

865
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:54,520
Find who he is at once

866
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:55,920
Go and talk to him

867
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:58,760
Let us talk patiently
and ask to move aside

868
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:00,560
If he disagrees,

869
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:04,040
let us bring him here threaten and
make him run away

870
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:04,960
What?

871
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,160
Whom?

872
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:07,160
Dude

873
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:09,000
How many Hindi
movies did we watch?

874
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:12,320
When hero proposes and the
heroine leaves silently,

875
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:14,880
...it means she is already engaged

876
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:17,440
You are correct, dude

877
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:18,400
Did you hear?

878
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:21,760
Let us kidnap that Pav Bajji
groom, as you said

879
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:24,120
- Let us kidnap
- Kajal confusion is cleared dude

880
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:25,880
Let us confirm love

881
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:27,560
Nothing like that

882
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:29,760
If so, wouldn't she have told me?

883
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:33,800
No girl will accept that
she is seeing a man

884
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:37,520
You don't even understand this
You are so innocent

885
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:22,360
For how many days,
Do we wait patiently?

886
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:24,400
They keep beheading

887
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:25,960
And should we tolerate this?

888
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,240
Our government won't
allow us do anything

889
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:29,800
We should decide

890
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:32,400
For each Indian, 10
Pakistanis must be beheaded

891
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:33,640
They will then understand who we are

892
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:35,840
We should not even spare a
single Pakistani at the border

893
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:38,000
We should show our country's valour

894
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:40,880
After this, they should be afraid of
touching another Indian

895
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:42,840
In Jammu Kashmir Baramulla
Let us kill the enemy and save India

896
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:44,640
Near Pakistan border
Jai Bharath

897
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:48,880
A beheaded body of an
Indian soldier is found

898
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:52,560
This incident has caused furore
all over the country

899
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:55,240
The border area seems to be in
high tension and unease

900
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:59,680
People all over the country are
staging protests against Pakistan

901
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:03,040
People stage protests demanding
Pakistanis at the border leave the country

902
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:03,880
Jawans

903
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:06,000
You could have faced similar
situations many times already

904
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:08,800
It is during curfew
Some anti social elements surface

905
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:11,760
We should be more
responsible and cautious

906
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:14,160
While providing security to the people,

907
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:18,400
It is also our duty to vigilantly watch,
That no culprit crosses the border

908
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:26,680
Our duty is not just
combating at the border...

909
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:28,360
...you might have understood this now

910
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:29,840
- Are you ready?
- Yes sir

911
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:31,080
Let's move

912
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:37,480
- Vasu
- Sir

913
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:38,760
What happened?

914
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:22,360
The army and the border
security force are on high alert

915
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:25,440
Government has made
all arrangements for the...

916
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:29,000
...safe transit of Pakistani
people to go to their country

917
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:05,880
Making use of the current situation,

918
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:09,320
There is a chance of riots by some
anti social elements! And therefore,

919
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:13,960
...rule 144 came into immediate
effect in the state of Jammu and Kashmir

920
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:34,760
Indian troops have fired on Kashmir
protesters killing a teenage student

921
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:36,960
It comes on the second day
of violent clashes

922
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,680
In the disputed Himalayan region

923
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:41,000
Now according to police
A boy was killed

924
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:42,520
When security forces

925
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:49,440
Pakistanis leave India

926
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:52,320
Pakistanis leave India

927
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:45,840
Pakistanis leave India

928
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:49,160
India is our country

929
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:35,800
'Intermission'

930
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:05,240
My father has
shawl business in India

931
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:09,560
I am coming here
for business sake

932
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,040
And you?

933
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:12,360
For studies?

934
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:15,440
No

935
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:18,320
I am here to visit my grandfather

936
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:19,920
My grandfather is from here

937
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:21,560
My grandmother is
from the other side

938
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:25,080
Before partition,
my grandmother lived here

939
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:26,920
When there was problem...

940
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:32,600
...my grandmother’s brother wanted both
of them to come and live in Pakistan

941
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:36,400
My grandfather disagreed to
that and stayed here

942
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:39,240
My grandmother was
separated from him

943
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:41,440
My mom was just
eight years old then

944
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:47,880
People from different parts of
the world meet and talk to each other

945
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:54,480
I asked my dad that couldn’t I meet
my grandfather who is just 20 miles away?

946
01:06:54,560 --> 01:06:57,760
He arranged for visa
and sent me here happily

947
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:02,000
When I came and met my grandfather
I experienced new happiness

948
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:06,360
But it didn’t last longer

949
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:18,000
- Pakistani...!
- Quit India!

950
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:22,720
- Pakistani...!
- Move out of India!

951
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:24,400
- Pakistani...!
- Quit India!

952
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:26,640
- Pakistani...!
- Move out of India!

953
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:30,880
- Pakistani...!
- Quit India!

954
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:34,640
Stop! Why are you
shouting slogans here?

955
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:38,360
How can he stay here after sending his
granddaughter to Pakistan?

956
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:40,880
He should go where he belongs

957
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:44,880
- Pakistani...!
- Move out!

958
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:47,880
- Move out!
- Quit India

959
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:49,080
Pathan

960
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:52,600
Why should I go?

961
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:54,080
This is my country

962
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:56,320
My soil
This is my origin

963
01:07:56,360 --> 01:07:59,360
I will not leave this
and go anywhere

964
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:01,360
In all agitation...

965
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:04,200
I live with a pride
that India is my country

966
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:06,840
I love this soil

967
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:11,680
I see the people
here as my brothers

968
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:15,840
Even a tree cannot survive
if it is uprooted

969
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:17,680
I am human

970
01:08:18,280 --> 01:08:21,640
This won’t be solved

971
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:24,400
After so many years

972
01:08:25,080 --> 01:08:30,040
My granddaughter came
to visit me with affinity

973
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:32,280
The only happiness
Allah favored on me

974
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:34,440
That too for only some days

975
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:38,680
She won’t come here anymore

976
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:45,840
I should die a lonely death

977
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:49,400
You all go there

978
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:51,760
Come, let us go down and see

979
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:54,000
Please don’t harm us

980
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:59,000
Not even one Pakistani
should go back alive

981
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:01,000
Don’t spare anyone
Kill everybody

982
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:02,240
Come, let’s leave

983
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:16,880
There is tension all over

984
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:19,040
They come in to the village
and chase them it seems

985
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:21,400
I spoke to my friend at the embassy

986
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:24,320
They have asked the embassy to close
till the situation becomes normal

987
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:27,160
It may take another five or six days
for the situation become normal

988
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:29,160
To the Police commissioner
or higher officials-

989
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:31,120
No, if they do not have
a passport and visa...

990
01:12:31,160 --> 01:12:33,280
...it will be treated as
without paper, illegal stay

991
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:35,960
The policemen make it a big issue
saying non-bailable offense

992
01:12:36,040 --> 01:12:37,320
It won’t work

993
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:39,880
What shall we do now, uncle?

994
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:45,480
Don’t be tensed
I will go to my place somehow

995
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:48,000
The border is just 4 kilometers
away from here

996
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:51,640
If I cross that, my village
is in the 14th kilometer

997
01:12:51,720 --> 01:12:53,640
Please help me for this

998
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:55,480
Border is completely
secured and sealed

999
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:56,880
How can you cross?

1000
01:12:56,920 --> 01:13:04,720
Than fearing for life and staying here,
I can walk 18 kilometers

1001
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:07,480
You cannot cross the border?

1002
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:09,200
Don’t you understand
what I am talking?

1003
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:12,920
I will somehow
go back to my village

1004
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:14,120
Please

1005
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:18,120
Hey, come here

1006
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:28,040
Vasu, look at the poor girl

1007
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:31,080
I should not say this
But then, I say

1008
01:13:31,160 --> 01:13:34,200
Three kilometers from here,
there is a river point

1009
01:13:34,280 --> 01:13:35,920
There won’t be any security

1010
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,200
Take her and send in that boat

1011
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:39,960
If she crosses the river,

1012
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:41,640
She won’t have any problem

1013
01:13:41,680 --> 01:13:43,120
She will reach her place

1014
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:47,520
Okay, uncle

1015
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:51,840
You are in love with
a Pakistani which is a risk

1016
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:54,000
If you go with her
it is ever more risky

1017
01:13:54,040 --> 01:13:55,640
I do not love a Pakistani

1018
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:57,760
The girl I love happened
to be a Pakistani

1019
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:04,200
Come, let us go

1020
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:18,640
Come on

1021
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:26,760
Hold it

1022
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:30,000
Go back Vasu
I will go after this

1023
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:31,120
I will come

1024
01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:34,440
No Vasu, you should not
get into the trouble

1025
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:35,880
Go back, Vasu

1026
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:39,160
It is 7 O' clock now, I will come
with you and return within 8 O'clock

1027
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:40,520
There won’t be any problem

1028
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:44,760
This second...

1029
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:47,000
My heart and mind says
I should go with you

1030
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:48,440
I am coming

1031
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:07,360
Vasu, I am afraid

1032
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:16,000
Vasu...careful, Vasu

1033
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:34,680
Vasu

1034
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:37,720
Kajal

1035
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:40,080
Hold

1036
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:41,400
Hold my hand

1037
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:43,600
Kajal

1038
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:46,720
Hold! Hold! Hold!

1039
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:51,960
- Vasu
- Hold

1040
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:29,280
'Hattian Bala
Pakistan'

1041
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:58,000
- Oh! Sorry
- Okay

1042
01:18:00,520 --> 01:18:01,600
Go

1043
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:29,920
How long is your village from here?

1044
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:32,160
- Approximately, 8 kilometers
- 8 kilometers?

1045
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:33,760
Shall we run for some yards?

1046
01:18:35,680 --> 01:18:37,000
Yes, we can reach soon

1047
01:18:40,240 --> 01:18:41,480
Come on

1048
01:18:42,440 --> 01:18:43,720
Ready

1049
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:45,600
One

1050
01:18:46,240 --> 01:18:48,400
Two...Three

1051
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:05,360
What happened?

1052
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:21,360
You are great

1053
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:25,480
Yes, only if I go first to my place,
can I show you the path

1054
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:28,880
What if you go and tumble
without knowing the path?

1055
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:39,480
What?

1056
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:44,400
How dare you come
to our country from here

1057
01:19:44,440 --> 01:19:47,520
Gather students and take tuition classes?

1058
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:52,760
When you have the guts to propose to a girl
coming from 3000 kilometres away

1059
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:54,680
Won’t I have some courage too?

1060
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:52,040
That is my village

1061
01:20:53,960 --> 01:20:57,120
Opposite to that mosque
That is my home

1062
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:02,000
Okay

1063
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:06,120
Please go back

1064
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:10,000
You don't need

1065
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:14,200
You don’t need me anymore?

1066
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:30,320
Vasu

1067
01:21:31,320 --> 01:21:32,720
Go safe

1068
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:56,240
Vasu

1069
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:28,920
Do we ever meet again, Kajal?

1070
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:32,400
I will definitely come to India
after the problem ends

1071
01:22:38,440 --> 01:22:40,440
Visit my home and then leave, Vasu

1072
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:43,040
I want to show you to my parents

1073
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:45,080
My mom...that is her grandmother

1074
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:48,240
They used to always speak about India

1075
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:51,240
About their love,
honesty, hard work

1076
01:23:51,480 --> 01:23:54,280
You are the first Indian
I have ever met

1077
01:23:55,080 --> 01:23:58,040
I trust what her mother told now

1078
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:01,920
All of us have
great respect for Indians

1079
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:05,360
Only some people create
problems with the border

1080
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:10,600
Even now, the wind from
the other side of the mountain

1081
01:24:10,640 --> 01:24:12,080
Blows here too

1082
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:15,200
Can the people who
constructed fence block this?

1083
01:24:15,240 --> 01:24:16,880
People who separated the mountains,

1084
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:18,800
...want to divide people too

1085
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:20,360
Son

1086
01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:24,400
We are happy that our daughter
returned amidst all this

1087
01:24:25,080 --> 01:24:29,560
We will be in peace only
when you go back to your parents

1088
01:24:31,880 --> 01:24:35,080
If I leave now, I will reach
the border before it dawns

1089
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:40,640
I will come with you
to show you the path

1090
01:24:40,680 --> 01:24:43,120
No, I can go alone
I remember the path we came

1091
01:24:44,760 --> 01:24:45,760
Son

1092
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:48,200
We will come to India definitely

1093
01:24:48,240 --> 01:24:49,800
And visit your home

1094
01:24:49,880 --> 01:24:54,840
To meet your mother who has raised
a brave and confident son

1095
01:24:55,480 --> 01:24:57,040
You can meet a mother like her...

1096
01:24:57,120 --> 01:25:00,200
...in all the families anywhere
after you cross 21 kilometers

1097
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:02,040
Please come

1098
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:03,640
I take leave

1099
01:25:31,080 --> 01:25:33,040
You have faced a lot
of difficulties for this

1100
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:35,160
Mom asked

1101
01:25:35,200 --> 01:25:36,840
So, you don’t need

1102
01:25:37,560 --> 01:25:38,560
I need for myself

1103
01:25:38,640 --> 01:25:41,040
To you or for your mom...tell me?

1104
01:25:42,440 --> 01:25:43,840
I want for myself

1105
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:54,000
Vasu

1106
01:25:55,800 --> 01:25:56,960
Don’t beat

1107
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:00,920
Mom

1108
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:03,920
He is of no fault

1109
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:05,760
Mom

1110
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:07,080
Tell him

1111
01:26:13,320 --> 01:26:15,240
Vasu...Vasu

1112
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:18,960
Mom, please tell them

1113
01:26:19,680 --> 01:26:21,040
Vasu

1114
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:24,160
Please leave him

1115
01:26:28,640 --> 01:26:31,240
He is of no fault, dad

1116
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:34,080
Tell him, dad

1117
01:26:34,160 --> 01:26:35,520
Vasu

1118
01:26:37,560 --> 01:26:39,160
Vasu

1119
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:46,040
He is my life, mom

1120
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:12,000
"Can the beloved love..."

1121
01:27:12,280 --> 01:27:17,880
"...be left helpless like an orphan?"

1122
01:27:18,360 --> 01:27:23,200
"Can the beloved love..."

1123
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:28,920
"...be left helpless like an orphan?"

1124
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:32,080
"I cry with love"

1125
01:27:32,120 --> 01:27:34,840
"Burn in tears"

1126
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:37,760
"Like an infant that can’t speak"

1127
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:41,200
"I dissolve without words"

1128
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:43,920
"Love is like wind"

1129
01:27:43,960 --> 01:27:46,640
"Both cross borders of countries"

1130
01:27:46,680 --> 01:27:49,080
"Speaks the wound of a girl"

1131
01:27:50,040 --> 01:27:55,560
"Can the beloved love..."

1132
01:27:55,640 --> 01:28:00,720
"...be left helpless like an orphan?"

1133
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:06,680
"Can the beloved love..."

1134
01:28:06,720 --> 01:28:12,720
"...be left helpless like an orphan?"

1135
01:28:13,320 --> 01:28:15,040
Leave me

1136
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:41,520
"With the stone of love, you have
broken the heart of a naive girl"

1137
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:47,480
"Without soliciting my heart,
You have in-filtered into my border"

1138
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:53,040
"My love, do not separate from me
How do little lass survive?"

1139
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:58,760
"A small sparrow,
does not fly though it has feathers"

1140
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:02,000
"My dear love
My dear love"

1141
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:09,080
"My blood spills on your body
My heart longs to run to you"

1142
01:29:10,720 --> 01:29:15,480
"Can the beloved love..."

1143
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:21,560
"...be left helpless like an orphan?"

1144
01:29:36,560 --> 01:29:39,440
Arrange your daughter’s
marriage with a Pakistani

1145
01:29:39,480 --> 01:29:42,080
Invitations should be ready
in a month’s time

1146
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:50,520
"The voiceless heart beats
to run to you and speak"

1147
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:56,640
"Fences prevent sharing the agony"

1148
01:29:56,720 --> 01:30:02,560
"Blood Rivers mix on the red earth"

1149
01:30:02,600 --> 01:30:08,120
"The preserved new love,
Exploded with noise"

1150
01:30:08,160 --> 01:30:15,920
"On your wounds,
My tear drops are the medicine"

1151
01:30:19,840 --> 01:30:25,000
"Can the beloved love..."

1152
01:30:25,200 --> 01:30:30,640
"...be left helpless like an orphan?"

1153
01:30:30,720 --> 01:30:33,520
"I cry with love"

1154
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:36,400
"Burn in tears"

1155
01:30:36,440 --> 01:30:39,320
"Like an infant that can’t speak"

1156
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:42,800
"I dissolve without words"

1157
01:30:42,840 --> 01:30:45,520
"Love is like wind"

1158
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:48,160
"Both cross borders of countries"

1159
01:30:48,240 --> 01:30:51,480
"Speaks the wound of a girl"

1160
01:31:06,640 --> 01:31:08,560
What happened to
the marriage invitation?

1161
01:31:10,360 --> 01:31:11,680
What happened?

1162
01:31:12,200 --> 01:31:14,000
Didn’t your daughter get a Pakistani?

1163
01:31:14,040 --> 01:31:15,680
She is not accepting

1164
01:31:16,400 --> 01:31:19,240
I cannot go against her wish

1165
01:31:19,280 --> 01:31:22,400
She won’t accept and you gave up

1166
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,160
Are you a Pakistani
Government servant?

1167
01:31:25,240 --> 01:31:27,280
You need money
the government allocates

1168
01:31:27,320 --> 01:31:29,160
You require wheat grown here

1169
01:31:29,640 --> 01:31:34,480
But your daughter wants
a groom from India

1170
01:31:36,720 --> 01:31:37,760
Go

1171
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:39,320
You daughter will agree

1172
01:31:39,400 --> 01:31:40,480
Go

1173
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:42,160
Go

1174
01:31:52,920 --> 01:31:56,160
Is our government aware of
the torture camps here?

1175
01:31:56,240 --> 01:31:57,520
How do they know?

1176
01:31:58,200 --> 01:32:01,560
Nobody has ever
gone alive from here

1177
01:32:06,120 --> 01:32:07,760
I request from all of you

1178
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:10,800
If a situation arises,
where they are going to kill me

1179
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:13,520
You all should kill me

1180
01:32:13,560 --> 01:32:15,600
They should not take my life

1181
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:20,880
The enemy who is carrying the body
should be ashamed that he is a loser

1182
01:32:21,040 --> 01:32:23,160
You can take away
life from my body

1183
01:32:23,200 --> 01:32:25,520
But can never take off the pride
that I am an Indian

1184
01:32:25,560 --> 01:32:27,960
My dead body should challenge him

1185
01:32:51,240 --> 01:32:54,800
Love makes your ears go deaf

1186
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:57,960
Nobody here has a desire or dream

1187
01:32:58,000 --> 01:32:59,080
Except one

1188
01:32:59,120 --> 01:33:00,320
Some or the other day

1189
01:33:00,360 --> 01:33:03,160
Will I be able to go back to
my country and meet my family

1190
01:33:03,240 --> 01:33:04,280
But, for you

1191
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:06,480
You want to meet the girl you love?

1192
01:33:07,080 --> 01:33:09,720
That is your dream, desire,
aim and everything

1193
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:14,760
You keep trying to jailbreak
any number of times for that

1194
01:33:15,080 --> 01:33:19,120
All of them here were indulged
in some issue and got caught

1195
01:33:19,960 --> 01:33:21,760
Everyone here has a similarity

1196
01:33:22,280 --> 01:33:26,080
In safeguarding their country and
being a captive for the country

1197
01:33:26,240 --> 01:33:31,200
But, you have come to the enemy and
die because of your undignified love

1198
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:34,400
Are you a BSF?

1199
01:33:34,440 --> 01:33:36,360
A BSF should not fall in love?

1200
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,760
Do people posted at the border
should necessarily die for the country?

1201
01:33:39,800 --> 01:33:42,000
Let me die for love, so what?

1202
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:44,440
Why don’t you talk?

1203
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:48,440
Government spends on you
for 38 weeks training...

1204
01:33:48,480 --> 01:33:50,640
...and also pays for your job

1205
01:33:50,680 --> 01:33:52,240
You will talk like this

1206
01:33:52,680 --> 01:33:54,320
Like Israel and Singapore...

1207
01:33:54,360 --> 01:33:58,640
...if there is a rule of compulsory
army service for two years

1208
01:33:59,200 --> 01:34:00,440
Will you talk like this?

1209
01:34:00,520 --> 01:34:02,120
Nothing is going to happen if we argue

1210
01:34:02,160 --> 01:34:04,240
Both of us are the same here

1211
01:34:04,280 --> 01:34:06,920
We are same in
our government’s opinion

1212
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,480
What, we both are the same?

1213
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:13,440
I am not a fool trying to
escape and get caught?

1214
01:34:14,240 --> 01:34:17,640
I will make a proper plan
and escape one day

1215
01:34:18,640 --> 01:34:20,440
Whether I go home alive or not,

1216
01:34:21,120 --> 01:34:27,240
I will definitely inform our government
about this torture camp and the 23 inmates

1217
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:33,640
When the day arrives...

1218
01:34:34,120 --> 01:34:36,320
...I will kill you for sure
and then escape from here

1219
01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:39,960
As you are in no way helpful
for the country

1220
01:34:40,480 --> 01:34:42,000
You shouldn’t enter India

1221
01:35:25,160 --> 01:35:28,280
'I cannot act against her wish'

1222
01:35:32,280 --> 01:35:37,520
Are you curious to know?
Who will be beheaded today?

1223
01:38:16,400 --> 01:38:19,880
It is me who decides,
who should be killed

1224
01:38:19,920 --> 01:38:21,480
This time,

1225
01:38:21,960 --> 01:38:27,400
The person who wins should die
The person who wins should die

1226
01:40:02,720 --> 01:40:05,600
I know only you will win if you are
allowed to combat with anyone here

1227
01:40:05,640 --> 01:40:07,560
Therefore, in tomorrow’s fight,

1228
01:40:07,960 --> 01:40:10,240
The general has decided
to kill the one who wins

1229
01:40:10,640 --> 01:40:14,240
My 12 year old daughter
has an Indian heart

1230
01:40:14,320 --> 01:40:17,360
No hospital here
could save my child

1231
01:40:17,440 --> 01:40:21,080
Indian doctors operated
and gave her second life

1232
01:40:21,160 --> 01:40:24,880
I wanted to show this gratitude
to an Indian for a very long time

1233
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:27,360
There won’t be a good chance
than this anymore

1234
01:40:28,960 --> 01:40:31,160
He should not cross our border

1235
01:40:31,280 --> 01:40:34,440
Behead him and throw his head
in their border before dawn

1236
01:40:34,480 --> 01:40:37,440
But, before killing the enemy,
betrayal should be killed

1237
01:40:37,480 --> 01:40:39,400
The girl is treason

1238
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:42,120
She doesn’t deserve
to live in this country

1239
01:40:42,200 --> 01:40:43,280
Kill her

1240
01:41:14,280 --> 01:41:15,600
Kill her

1241
01:41:30,840 --> 01:41:31,920
What happened?

1242
01:41:31,960 --> 01:41:33,720
Her father comes in front

1243
01:41:33,800 --> 01:41:37,080
Kill whoever tries to save treason

1244
01:41:37,120 --> 01:41:38,200
Okay, sir

1245
01:41:43,240 --> 01:41:44,720
Dad

1246
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:24,600
Mom

1247
01:42:26,840 --> 01:42:28,440
Mom

1248
01:42:40,400 --> 01:42:41,800
Chottu

1249
01:42:42,520 --> 01:42:44,120
Chottu...no

1250
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:53,640
No...Chottu

1251
01:43:17,840 --> 01:43:19,600
Allah

1252
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,280
Dad...Dad

1253
01:44:29,040 --> 01:44:31,160
Chottu

1254
01:44:59,280 --> 01:45:00,600
Allah

1255
01:45:05,440 --> 01:45:06,840
Vasu

1256
01:45:15,640 --> 01:45:18,000
Leave dear

1257
01:45:18,040 --> 01:45:21,120
Your family lays here
to keep you alive

1258
01:45:21,160 --> 01:45:24,920
Your dad wanted to
give the life you desired

1259
01:45:25,480 --> 01:45:27,640
All these happened in the midst

1260
01:45:29,040 --> 01:45:30,440
Listen to me, dear

1261
01:45:32,160 --> 01:45:34,240
Please leave, dear

1262
01:45:34,920 --> 01:45:37,480
They will be with Allah

1263
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:39,760
For sure

1264
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:43,880
Please leave, dear

1265
01:46:32,120 --> 01:46:34,680
'Hattian Bala
Pakistan'

1266
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,440
Death would have grabbed me

1267
01:48:09,760 --> 01:48:12,200
Now, it is going to
take you along too

1268
01:48:12,240 --> 01:48:13,640
I haven’t escaped to die

1269
01:48:13,680 --> 01:48:14,840
To live

1270
01:48:15,040 --> 01:48:16,400
To live with you

1271
01:48:19,240 --> 01:48:20,880
I am afraid, Vasu

1272
01:48:21,560 --> 01:48:23,440
Only hope kills fear

1273
01:48:23,480 --> 01:48:24,640
No

1274
01:48:24,800 --> 01:48:28,000
They won’t spare us anymore

1275
01:48:28,440 --> 01:48:32,840
Your family had faith that you will be
safe and happy in my company

1276
01:48:33,160 --> 01:48:34,640
It won’t go in vain

1277
01:48:35,240 --> 01:48:36,400
Not only that

1278
01:48:37,120 --> 01:48:41,080
Death of good people in this world
shouldn’t go vain without destroying evil

1279
01:48:41,600 --> 01:48:46,080
23 men are enduring torture
just because they are Indians

1280
01:48:46,600 --> 01:48:49,320
The agony of my family without me...

1281
01:48:49,400 --> 01:48:51,400
Is similar to the families of 23 men

1282
01:48:53,440 --> 01:48:55,280
If dead, only the both of us will go

1283
01:48:55,600 --> 01:48:58,120
If we manage to escape,
23 lives will survive

1284
01:48:58,160 --> 01:48:59,480
How do we escape?

1285
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:03,200
Abandon fear and let us hope that
somehow we are going to escape

1286
01:49:05,720 --> 01:49:08,480
The river we have crossed is
just 8 kilometers away

1287
01:49:11,560 --> 01:49:12,680
I repeat,

1288
01:49:14,560 --> 01:49:17,160
Only hope kills fear

1289
01:49:17,200 --> 01:49:19,640
I just have that right now

1290
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:20,960
Let's go

1291
01:50:01,080 --> 01:50:03,920
"Victory, victory, victory to thee"

1292
01:50:03,960 --> 01:50:06,120
"Salutations to mother India"

1293
01:50:06,600 --> 01:50:09,440
"Victory, victory, victory to thee"

1294
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:11,840
"Salutations to mother India"

1295
01:50:11,880 --> 01:50:14,680
"Your country is your breathe"

1296
01:50:14,720 --> 01:50:17,480
"Recite that louder"

1297
01:50:17,560 --> 01:50:20,360
"Self-respect is your valour"

1298
01:50:20,440 --> 01:50:22,800
"Conquer each and every blow"

1299
01:50:23,520 --> 01:50:26,360
"Victory, victory, victory to thee
Salutations to mother India"

1300
01:50:26,400 --> 01:50:29,080
"Salutations to mother India"

1301
01:50:29,160 --> 01:50:31,920
"Victory, victory, victory to thee
Salutations to mother India"

1302
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,680
"Salutations to mother India"

1303
01:50:34,720 --> 01:50:37,200
"Victory, victory, victory to thee"

1304
01:50:37,480 --> 01:50:41,120
"Victory, victory, victory to thee"

1305
01:51:10,360 --> 01:51:12,240
He is caught

1306
01:51:12,760 --> 01:51:14,760
Surround him up
Come on Come on

1307
01:51:48,160 --> 01:51:49,640
- Sir
- Tell me

1308
01:51:49,720 --> 01:51:51,360
We have entered the forest, sir

1309
01:51:51,440 --> 01:51:53,000
We are searching

1310
01:51:53,040 --> 01:51:55,600
He should be running
towards the border

1311
01:51:56,280 --> 01:51:58,040
I have sent extra choppers

1312
01:51:58,920 --> 01:52:00,520
I have sent extra force too

1313
01:52:01,120 --> 01:52:03,720
They both shouldn’t leave alive

1314
01:52:03,760 --> 01:52:04,960
- Yes, sir
- Search

1315
01:52:42,680 --> 01:52:43,720
Kajal

1316
01:52:49,040 --> 01:52:50,160
Kajal

1317
01:53:01,680 --> 01:53:03,200
The girl is with us

1318
01:53:44,600 --> 01:53:47,520
1...2...3

1319
01:54:44,040 --> 01:54:45,080
Malik

1320
01:54:45,520 --> 01:54:46,920
Where are you guys?

1321
01:54:46,960 --> 01:54:48,080
Malik

1322
01:54:53,760 --> 01:54:55,240
Malik, give reply

1323
01:54:55,480 --> 01:54:56,840
Malik, give reply

1324
01:54:57,560 --> 01:54:58,560
Malik

1325
01:54:58,720 --> 01:54:59,760
Malik

1326
01:55:01,720 --> 01:55:03,120
Malik, do you receive?

1327
01:55:03,160 --> 01:55:04,600
Malik, do you receive?

1328
01:55:05,520 --> 01:55:06,560
Malik

1329
01:55:06,800 --> 01:55:07,920
Malik

1330
01:55:23,320 --> 01:55:24,960
Sir...sir?

1331
01:55:25,200 --> 01:55:26,200
What?

1332
01:55:26,240 --> 01:55:28,480
They are running towards
Dera point at the North East

1333
01:55:28,520 --> 01:55:30,360
The border is just half
a kilometer away

1334
01:55:34,240 --> 01:55:36,480
- Sir
- Don’t shoot

1335
01:55:52,600 --> 01:55:53,880
Come on

1336
01:55:54,360 --> 01:55:56,520
Indian BSF

1337
01:55:57,120 --> 01:55:58,600
Pakistan

1338
01:55:59,160 --> 01:56:00,480
Or India?

1339
01:56:01,080 --> 01:56:02,360
Let’s see

1340
01:56:03,200 --> 01:56:04,200
Come

1341
01:56:04,240 --> 01:56:05,720
Come...come on

1342
01:56:07,760 --> 01:56:08,960
Come

1343
01:56:21,120 --> 01:56:22,440
Vasu

1344
01:56:47,520 --> 01:56:50,320
In front of Pakistani’s valour,

1345
01:56:50,360 --> 01:56:52,600
You should bow down

1346
01:56:53,080 --> 01:56:54,720
Have you become valiant?

1347
01:56:54,760 --> 01:56:55,920
Have you?

1348
01:56:55,960 --> 01:56:57,120
Come on

1349
01:57:10,480 --> 01:57:15,760
The day Kashmir uniting with
Pakistan is not far away

1350
01:57:15,840 --> 01:57:18,360
Till a last Jawan like me survives,

1351
01:57:18,480 --> 01:57:21,320
You can never take even one
square feet from India

1352
01:57:22,120 --> 01:57:23,120
Come on

1353
01:57:23,200 --> 01:57:25,880
"Victory, victory, victory to thee"

1354
01:57:25,920 --> 01:57:27,960
"Salutations to mother India"

1355
01:57:28,720 --> 01:57:31,560
"Victory, victory, victory to thee"

1356
01:57:31,600 --> 01:57:33,720
"Salutations to mother India"

1357
01:57:33,800 --> 01:57:36,680
"Your country is your breathe"

1358
01:57:36,760 --> 01:57:39,560
"Recite that louder"

1359
01:57:39,600 --> 01:57:42,400
"Self-respect is your valour"

1360
01:57:42,440 --> 01:57:44,760
"Conquer each and every blow"

1361
01:57:45,520 --> 01:57:48,280
"Victory, victory, victory to thee
Salutations to mother India"

1362
01:57:48,320 --> 01:57:51,080
"Salutations to mother India"

1363
01:57:51,120 --> 01:57:53,920
"Victory, victory, victory to thee
Salutations to mother India"

1364
01:57:53,960 --> 01:57:56,680
"Salutations to mother India"

1365
01:57:56,840 --> 01:58:02,840
"Victory, victory, victory to thee"

1366
01:58:49,280 --> 01:58:51,640
If I desire, I can kill you right now

1367
01:58:51,840 --> 01:58:53,320
But that is not what I want

1368
01:58:54,360 --> 01:58:55,680
I should go back to India

1369
01:58:56,360 --> 01:58:58,240
If you still want to prevent me,

1370
01:58:59,040 --> 01:59:00,680
I will kill you and then go

1371
01:59:03,920 --> 01:59:06,840
Even if you spare me,

1372
01:59:06,880 --> 01:59:10,880
I am never going to say
'Indians are good and I like them'

1373
01:59:11,400 --> 01:59:12,520
Still

1374
01:59:13,080 --> 01:59:15,240
I hate Indians

1375
01:59:15,280 --> 01:59:17,440
Why do you have so much
hatred towards Indians?

1376
01:59:17,480 --> 01:59:19,360
Because, I am a Pakistani

1377
01:59:19,720 --> 01:59:22,800
For our development,
India should be ruined

1378
01:59:22,840 --> 01:59:26,560
The effort for your development
should start from within your country

1379
01:59:28,080 --> 01:59:29,920
A country’s downfall

1380
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:33,200
Can never be a reason for
another country’s progress

1381
01:59:33,720 --> 01:59:34,760
Like this,

1382
01:59:35,360 --> 01:59:36,680
India, Pakistan

1383
01:59:36,720 --> 01:59:38,160
Israel, Palestine

1384
01:59:38,320 --> 01:59:40,040
North Korea, South Korea

1385
01:59:40,080 --> 01:59:42,640
Framed these neighboring
countries as enemies

1386
01:59:42,680 --> 01:59:44,120
That is the victory of superpowers

1387
01:59:44,160 --> 01:59:45,720
Failing to understand this

1388
01:59:45,800 --> 01:59:47,680
In the name of patriotism

1389
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:51,320
We fight with each other and
neglect our development

1390
01:59:52,160 --> 01:59:56,360
It is not necessary to prove our
patriotism by creating an enemy

1391
01:59:56,440 --> 01:59:59,480
It is not necessary to contemplate
Pakistan as enemy

1392
01:59:59,520 --> 02:00:01,640
You don’t hate Pakistan?

1393
02:00:01,960 --> 02:00:03,560
You don’t consider us as enemies?

1394
02:00:03,600 --> 02:00:05,200
If I had a thought like this...

1395
02:00:05,640 --> 02:00:08,600
...I would have not come
this far for a girl I love

1396
02:00:26,440 --> 02:00:30,200
'An illegal torture camp
which was being operated...

1397
02:00:30,240 --> 02:00:32,600
'...in Pakistan for many years
have been found'

1398
02:00:32,640 --> 02:00:38,200
'The person who gave details of the secret
torture camp to Indian government...'

1399
02:00:38,240 --> 02:00:41,480
'Vasu...is responsible
for rescuing 23 Indians...'

1400
02:00:41,520 --> 02:00:44,840
'...belongs to the border
security force from Tamil Nadu'

1401
02:00:44,880 --> 02:00:48,240
'...is appreciated by the President and
the prime minister of our country'

1402
02:00:48,280 --> 02:00:50,600
'For many years they were
separated from their families'

1403
02:00:50,680 --> 02:00:55,720
'When they got to meet them, their families
celebrate the reunion cheerfully'

1404
02:02:15,840 --> 02:02:18,720
"Victory, victory, victory to thee"

1405
02:02:18,760 --> 02:02:20,840
"Salutations to mother India"

1406
02:02:21,040 --> 02:02:23,840
"Your country is your breathe"

1407
02:02:23,880 --> 02:02:26,640
"Recite that louder"

1408
02:02:26,680 --> 02:02:29,560
"Self-respect is your valour"

1409
02:02:29,600 --> 02:02:31,960
"Conquer each and every blow"

1410
02:02:32,640 --> 02:02:35,520
"Victory, victory, victory to thee
Salutations to mother India"

1411
02:02:35,560 --> 02:02:38,240
"Salutations to mother India"

1412
02:02:38,320 --> 02:02:41,080
"Victory, victory, victory to thee
Salutations to mother India"

1413
02:02:41,160 --> 02:02:43,800
"Salutations to mother India"

1414
02:02:43,840 --> 02:02:46,320
"Victory, victory, victory to thee"

1415
02:02:46,640 --> 02:02:50,240
"Victory, victory, victory to thee"
