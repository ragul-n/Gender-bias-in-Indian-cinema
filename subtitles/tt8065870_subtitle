1
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:38,860
EVEN AS THIS STORY IS
ACTUALLY HAPPENING IN MUMBAI,

2
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:42,530
WE HAVE MADE THE CHARACTERS SPEAK IN TELUGU
TO BE UNDERSTOOD BY THE TELUGU AUDIENCE

3
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:21,820
I am about to kill the three of them.

4
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:25,650
But I need 50 Lakhs for each killing.

5
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:27,600
There would be no further
discussion on that.

6
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:29,780
Okay.

7
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,520
Acid..

8
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:55,010
Either if you don't fear me

9
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:58,690
or deny anything I ask for,
this is what would happen.

10
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,000
Not just that

11
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:06,400
I am not just killing you,

12
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:10,840
but I am going to torture
you and then kill you

13
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:16,940
Pasari Sir

14
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,190
I don't understand something

15
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:23,650
Why do you torture them when
you decided to kill them?

16
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:30,790
Bhushim, once people get to know
how cruel their deaths were,

17
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:39,740
No one would even think of
revolting like these people

18
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:43,400
Sir, those three are dead

19
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:51,940
Kuldeep, bring the bodies of those
we already killed and place them here

20
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:52,940
Yes sir

21
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,730
Breaking News

22
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:29,810
Fake encounter report on Narayan Pasari,
the most famous police officer of Mumbai

23
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,760
The allegation is that before Pasari
killed some criminals in the encounter

24
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:37,470
he brutally tortured them and killed them,
say the sources

25
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:40,310
An underworld gang killed them.

26
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,830
I reached there along with my team in the
last minute and finished the entire gang

27
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,900
But sir, why did that gang torture
them so badly before killing them?

28
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:53,100
To induce fear in others to even think
about revolting against them in the future

29
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:55,940
Pasari Sir,
there has been such a huge allegation on you.

30
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:57,010
What is your response on this?

31
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:00,060
Whatever I did was for the system.

32
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,190
The truth is on my side.

33
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,400
Whatever is the truth of Pasari,

34
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,470
the same system has
approached the High Court

35
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:11,590
and formed a Special Investigation
Team for enquiry on Narayan Pasari

36
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:17,650
IPS officer Shivaji Rao from Hyderabad
has been appointed as its chief.

37
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:38,560
The mistake you did was
not looking into my eyes.

38
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:40,890
You can make out the
next move from the eyes.

39
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,660
Come on. Let's try again.

40
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:21,940
I told you to look into my eyes,
not my face.

41
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:25,020
Your fight is generated in your mind.

42
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:31,480
You may think why do we need to fight
when everyone possesses guns in 2018,

43
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:36,770
But once you join the Police Department,
you should be ready for anything.

44
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:37,840
Yes sir.

45
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,100
Sir.

46
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,850
SIT stands for Special Investigation Team

47
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:52,350
If an enquiry is to be done on any
Police Officer in the department,

48
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:55,230
they usually appoint an
officer from another state

49
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:57,390
so that the enquiry
would be done impartially

50
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,730
Who is that officer you are talking about?

51
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:00,650
His name is Pasari.

52
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:07,900
Pasari has many fans of among the cops.

53
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:09,770
Including me.

54
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,650
Few years back

55
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,060
He is the one who finished the Mumbai mafia;
right?

56
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:18,600
Of course,
who does not know about Pasari, dad?

57
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,060
Then what is this enquiry suddenly?

58
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:23,270
Just an enquiry.

59
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,230
They put allegations on Mahatma Gandhi too.

60
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:34,730
Ok, at least with this reason you
got a chance to spend time with Shalu

61
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,440
Shalu, your dad has called.

62
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:04,980
Hi Shalu.

63
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,650
Hi dad, how are you?

64
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:07,940
I am fine dear.

65
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,940
I am coming to Mumbai.

66
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,190
To see me?

67
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:14,310
Yes, and also on work.

68
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:17,270
I am posted there on a job.

69
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:18,850
What job is it?

70
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:27,840
Welcome to Mumbai

71
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,200
Hey Prasad

72
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,130
Hi Boss

73
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:32,390
You are more fit than earlier.
- Am I?

74
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:34,310
As i said, he is John

75
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,940
Hey John!
- Great to meet you sir.

76
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,980
Prasad was talking a lot about you.

77
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:39,310
Was it in a good way?

78
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:40,900
I don't have a habit of lying at all boss.

79
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:41,900
Okay.
- Let's go.

80
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,150
Please sir.

81
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,480
Hey John, where are you from?
- Delhi Sir

82
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:48,400
Nice

83
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,720
How is the job in Mumbai Prasad?
- It is fine sir.

84
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,730
Shivaji Rao...

85
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:07,930
That guy from Hyderabad thinks
he can meddle with us in Mumbai?

86
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:12,710
Bhushim, break the legs of that Kaleem

87
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,320
and tell him that we wouldn't
warn him a second time.

88
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:20,850
This time,
its just his neck that would be broken.

89
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:23,690
Boss

90
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,450
The underworld in Mumbai is curbed.

91
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,460
we can say it almost doesn't exist.

92
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:32,740
One or two incidents like the
Pasari one keep happening.

93
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:38,000
Hey,
such crimes keep happening in every city.

94
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:39,950
Why should we blame just Mumbai?

95
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,190
Sir to be speaking the truth,

96
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:48,130
There is no city in the entire
country as peaceful as Mumbai.

97
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,730
- Ah!

98
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:52,100
Hello Shalu.

99
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:54,230
Have you reach?
- Yes dear, I came to Mumbai.

100
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:57,400
Prasad uncle has picked me up,
say hello to him.

101
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,770
Hey Shalu
- Hello uncle

102
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:05,650
Do you know, your dad has not informed me
even when you are in Mumbai since so long?

103
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:08,930
Anyway, we got a chance to meet
once again because of this case

104
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:20,440
In my opinion,
some gang is doing this to trap Pasari

105
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:26,190
I am very sad to be running an enquiry
over a great officer like Pasari

106
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,350
That is the beauty in our duty boss.

107
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,020
No one can understand what,
when and where will one have to do.

108
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:33,440
What I understood is

109
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,440
before understanding something,

110
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,090
we should understand the
need to understand it.

111
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:40,810
I did not understand.

112
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:43,020
Would you not have been the boss
yourself if you understood it dude!

113
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,650
I got it.

114
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:47,090
Daddy!

115
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,010
Daddy.

116
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:57,300
Hey!

117
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:03,770
Missed you too.

118
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,150
Will you shower your entire love on your
dad or is something left for me too?

119
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,270
Tell me a new joke Prasad uncle.

120
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,190
I,
myself have become a joke these days dear.

121
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,900
John, she is my daughter Shalu.

122
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,690
She likes dance very much.

123
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:21,230
She has been here in Mumbai since two months
and is learning dance in an institute.

124
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:22,170
Oh.. Wow!

125
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:27,520
Daddy, my school is sending us to the
Asiatic ballet competition in Russia.

126
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,480
Wow!

127
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:30,350
Why did you come to Mumbai actually?

128
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,650
It is slightly complicated.

129
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:35,440
I know, it is about Narayan Pasari right?

130
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:38,940
It's the effect of media.

131
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:41,270
Do you think he is bad too?

132
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:43,900
What I think does not matter.

133
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:46,020
My job is to find out the truth.

134
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:48,940
By the way grandma has
sent you home made sweets

135
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:23,400
Sir, the new SIT officer Sivaji Rao

136
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:28,150
has come to the Crime Branch
to meet JCP Ramdas sir.

137
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,060
Sir

138
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:51,310
I've been appointed as the SIT chief
for Narayan Pasari case investigation

139
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:53,020
Happy.

140
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,520
but unfortunate
- Sorry?

141
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:01,230
Happy in case of your appointment,

142
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:05,250
but regarding an enquiry on
people in our own department

143
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,290
I'm not happy.

144
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,480
Unfortunate

145
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:09,810
System?

146
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,100
Yes, system

147
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:12,900
How much sugar?

148
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:16,020
How much sugar do you need in coffee?

149
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:17,900
I will have tea Sir

150
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:22,450
I know that SIT is not under
the limits of Mumbai Police

151
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:25,930
but is under the High Court.

152
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,100
Happy

153
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:29,940
If you need something...

154
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:31,940
What is it sir?

155
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:38,940
If you need any help from the Mumbai police

156
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:44,060
I will happily get it done
- Thank you Sir

157
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:46,230
I have selected my team.

158
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:48,270
An old colleague of my team named Prasad,

159
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:50,400
I know him well from the Academy days

160
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:53,270
I took his help in team selection

161
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,520
I do not know who he is

162
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,980
Sir, he is in our department and...
- It's a joke.

163
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:04,650
It is my habit. I know Prasad very well.

164
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:08,020
But I'm not happy.
- Why sir?

165
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,020
An enquiry on an officer
from our own Department?

166
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:15,590
Sir, you know it.
Aren't we all a part of this system?

167
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:17,600
No.

168
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:19,650
Thanks

169
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:22,020
Joke?

170
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:25,560
Thanks

171
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:27,940
Thank you sir, thank you

172
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:34,610
After that Chhattisgarh incident,

173
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,760
It's been a long time.

174
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:38,060
You and here?

175
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,600
You always thought I was unintelligent;
didn't you?

176
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:47,110
But the foolish cops here
believed that I was intelligent

177
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:49,700
and made me as DCP of the Mumbai
Crime Branch Intelligence wing

178
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:52,100
Wow! Congrats.

179
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:56,240
Do you even remember me ever?

180
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,900
Do not lie, I have become intelligent now.

181
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:02,290
You have not changed at all, always happy.

182
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:07,480
The reason for my happiness
is not my marriage.

183
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,520
Are you married?

184
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,950
I got divorced too.

185
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,770
I got bored of him.

186
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,650
What bigger reason do
you need for a divorce?

187
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:23,440
But there is another reason too.

188
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,270
Shall I tell you?

189
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:29,480
Anyone would seem boring
after meeting a guy like you.

190
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,690
Ok, now don't get embarrassed.

191
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:36,190
I know Geetha was your first and last love.

192
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,060
That is why I married someone else.

193
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:40,850
Ok, leave it.

194
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,020
How is Shalu?

195
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,770
Daddy, do you keep thinking
about mom a lot of times?

196
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:55,310
More than her, I keep thinking about
the mistake that happened because of me.

197
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,940
I was their target.

198
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,980
But, your poor mom was dragged into it.

199
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:04,560
Daddy, whererever mom is,
she would believe that it's not your mistake.

200
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:05,900
Even all of us.

201
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:17,020
But, I can never think so dear.

202
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:20,730
That is why I am taking my job so seriously.

203
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:25,390
Yes minister sir, why would you fear me?

204
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:31,930
Your contact is directly with the
Inspector General of Police; isn't it?

205
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:33,800
Good!

206
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,890
But, Minister sir,

207
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:42,300
you should be alive in
order to complain to IG sir!

208
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:58,390
You should have remembered one thing.

209
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:02,150
Whatever heights you reach in life,

210
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:06,320
there would always be someone on top of you.

211
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:12,180
Hello

212
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,760
Sir, my name is Shivaji.

213
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:20,800
I've taken charge as the SIT chief in the
enquiry Mumbai High Court has put on you.

214
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:26,050
I need to meet you once before
I start my investigation.

215
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:28,220
Okay.

216
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,640
Ok sir

217
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,220
Good morning sir.
- Good morning sir.

218
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:29,890
Sir, I always admired you for
finishing the Mumbai underworld.

219
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:38,430
But, I am very sad for meeting
you in such a situation

220
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:43,680
You are doing your job just
like I am doing my job.

221
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:44,980
It's ok.

222
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,430
Thanks for understanding sir.

223
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,550
It is been many days since
that incident took place.

224
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:53,140
This is the statement given by you then.

225
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,050
If you wish to change your statement,

226
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:00,930
I will start my investigation from there.

227
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,390
I have no intention to
change my statement at all.

228
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:07,300
That is confirmed.

229
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:14,890
In that case,
sign on this old statement on today's date.

230
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,680
I feel there is a lot of anger in him.

231
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,680
What anger?

232
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:46,410
Pasari is more mafia than a policeman.

233
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:48,680
What does he actually think of himself?

234
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,960
Whatever it is, he is elder to you.

235
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:52,860
Don't talk as you like.

236
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:59,790
If the department looks down on the very
guy who did so much for the department,

237
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,890
what else would he feel other than anger?

238
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:04,100
Don't talk like you know everything.

239
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:05,680
It's not 'like I know' but I do know.

240
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:07,720
that's why I am working above
you in the Intelligence wing

241
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:13,930
Someone would beat you up badly someday.

242
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:16,220
No such person is born till date.

243
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:17,640
Jokes apart Meena.

244
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,350
Crime is a legal word.

245
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:25,010
In many instances, the reason behind
a crime may be morally correct

246
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:28,850
We need to know the reason Pasari had

247
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:29,890
There is a guy.

248
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:31,570
May be he can help you.

249
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:34,180
Bhajarangi, a suspended cop.

250
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,890
Both of them used to work together earlier,
but have become enemies now.

251
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:40,390
But be careful Shiva, he is a bit mad.

252
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,720
Who are you?

253
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:06,220
Bhajarangi?

254
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:09,140
Who are you?
- Shivaji

255
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:17,180
But, why should I believe you?

256
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,970
What if I ask you the same thing?

257
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:29,890
Pasari used to be more with
the underworld than the police.

258
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:34,930
He is completely...
- Completely?

259
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:40,100
with underworld Don Nakki

260
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:43,220
But Nakki retired long back, didn't he?

261
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,060
In police, politics and Mafia,
whatever is visible from outside is not true.

262
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:53,390
It is just a show man.

263
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:55,350
Then what is Pasari's show?

264
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,220
What is my profit in telling you?

265
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:01,180
I will get you a reward from the
Government if the information is correct.

266
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,430
Reward!

267
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:04,600
It is not for the money,

268
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:08,260
I am doing it for my revenge.

269
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:12,180
Then tell me the truth of Pasari,
but do not lie

270
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:17,550
I will say both,
the false truth and true lies of Pasari

271
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:23,050
Forget which truth Bhajarangi said
is a lie and which lie is a truth.

272
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,180
Send our men as security to Bhajarangi.

273
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:29,140
But no one should know about this

274
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:31,770
Including Bhajarangi
- Ok.

275
00:27:58,210 --> 00:27:58,970
Swamy

276
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:06,390
Wait... I came to talk about Pasari.

277
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:24,680
I am completely convinced about Pasari.

278
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,650
I need your witness for that.

279
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:28,300
What is the guarantee for my safety then?

280
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:32,760
There is no guarantee.
Pasari may either kill you or even me.

281
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:35,720
But we should finish
him before he does that.

282
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:38,260
I need a detailed statement about Pasari.

283
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:49,900
Tell me Shivaji.

284
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:55,100
Sir, I need to submit a report
regarding my investigation in the Court.

285
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,330
I need your signature on a
document related to that.

286
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:01,260
Can you please come to the office once?

287
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:06,930
Only one signature sir.

288
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,470
Okay.

289
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:29,970
Read this completely once and
write something if you wish to.

290
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:32,050
Court will take that as your statement.

291
00:33:56,500 --> 00:34:00,220
You would have understood by now.
You are under arrest.

292
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:10,350
Can I make a phone call?

293
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:19,450
You have to handover your guns.

294
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:32,600
Stop..

295
00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:50,720
Whatever I did, I did it for the system.

296
00:34:51,850 --> 00:34:55,140
I too am doing it for the same system

297
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:22,280
This is not a happy news.

298
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,560
This is shameful for the entire department.

299
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:28,000
But Sir, Narayan Pasari is a
highly renowned police officer

300
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:31,970
Your department has praised
him a lot many times

301
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:34,100
Then why did he do such a thing?

302
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:37,510
Human will not be the same always.

303
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:38,090
But sir that is...

304
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:44,600
Rule, money,
power and greed keep changing a human.

305
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:48,930
Maybe the greed Pasari had,
changed him this way.

306
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:54,760
His ego might have grown, making him think
that department doesn't exist without him.

307
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:57,580
Else, he would have thought
he was the system himself.

308
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,680
He is just arrested.

309
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:03,010
Who knows what will be proved in the court?

310
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:06,470
I some times feel you are
a member of Pasari's team.

311
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:09,220
Wow, you are so intelligent!

312
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,300
Vikram

313
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,800
What Meena said is right.

314
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:17,550
No single person should have
the power to take a decision

315
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:19,950
That is the greatness in our system.

316
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:25,050
That is why there are so many levels
and procedures to provide justice.

317
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:31,980
Daddy, after watching Pasari's arrest on TV

318
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:35,540
all my friends are treating me like
a hero too for being your daughter

319
00:36:36,350 --> 00:36:40,930
I forgot to tell you.
Daddy, I saw mom yesterday night.

320
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,510
Was it in your dream?

321
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,470
No, like a star in the sky.

322
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:48,550
How do you know that star is your mom?

323
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,800
I just know it, that's all.

324
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:53,350
Even mom came to know about
what a great job you have done

325
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:56,330
And this party is for all three of us.

326
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:00,580
Thank you Shalu

327
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,600
Do you know?
whole Mumbai is now talking about you

328
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,530
This is not a happy news.

329
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:09,920
This is shameful for the entire department.

330
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:13,600
But Sir,
Narayan Pasari is a renowned police officer.

331
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:17,550
Your department has praised
him a lot many times.

332
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,260
Then why did he do such a thing?

333
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:22,680
Human will not be the same always.

334
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:27,620
Rule, money,
power and greed keep changing a human.

335
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:31,450
Maybe the greed Pasari had,
changed him this way.

336
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:43,340
Happy birthday to you.
Happy birthday to you.

337
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:46,380
Happy birthday to you dear Meena.

338
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:47,830
Happy birthday to you

339
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:48,740
Vikram

340
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:53,930
John and Prasad sound like Balasubrahmanyam
and Jesudas when compared to you.

341
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:12,520
Oh yeah! Oh yeah!

342
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:20,660
"Trumphet and percussions!"

343
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:27,750
"The shehnai is playing"

344
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:31,010
"How good is the fun in dancing"

345
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:34,390
"Just don't care about anything,
there are no more worries"

346
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:41,290
"It's crazy inside,
the leg is shaking to the music"

347
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:51,080
"Have fun and frolic dude,
get high on dance moves dude"

348
00:38:54,460 --> 00:39:00,630
"The shehnai is playing"

349
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:04,030
Oh yeah!

350
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:07,570
"Today is small but the night is very long"

351
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:11,150
"You keep toppling till the morning"

352
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:15,480
"Once you are tired after
singing and dancing"

353
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:18,770
"When your words overlap and become a mess"

354
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:30,800
Scotch, whiskey and vodka
will never cheat you.

355
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:48,730
"Open the soda bottle and
drink as much as you want to"

356
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:51,260
"Join hands with me dude"

357
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:57,990
"Do I disclose the secret inside?
Do I shock you by disclosing it?"

358
00:39:58,870 --> 00:40:04,160
"Whatever the drink is or whatever is the
ocassion, it is the same dance always"

359
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:11,320
"Writing a song and making a tune for it,
you feel proud raising your collar"

360
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:17,390
"The song and dance are superb, dear cupid!
drink with some ice now"

361
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:27,890
"How good is the fun in dancing"

362
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:31,170
"Just don't care about anything,
there are no more worries"

363
00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:37,930
"It's crazy inside,
the leg is shaking to the music"

364
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:47,880
"Have fun and frolic dude,
get high on dance moves dude"

365
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:57,500
"The shehnai is playing"

366
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:02,250
The shehnai is playing,
the shehnai is playing.

367
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:07,010
By the way Vikram,
Why do you seem so happy these days?

368
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,940
Please don't tell me
you are getting married.

369
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:18,360
After seeing a woman like you, I have
decided not to marry any woman in my life.

370
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:23,180
Does that mean you would marry a man?

371
00:41:26,770 --> 00:41:27,490
Damn it man.

372
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:31,690
Vikram, I never thought you are like that.

373
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:37,340
Ok madam.
- It is ok.

374
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:39,000
Once again happy birthday to you
- Chill.

375
00:41:43,730 --> 00:41:45,100
Bye Vikram.
- Bye.

376
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:47,430
Brother, call from boss

377
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:49,570
But the boss is right here.

378
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:53,590
I mean the real boss... wife!

379
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:56,610
Thats right.
- You are too much.

380
00:41:56,890 --> 00:41:58,100
Ok, I will take leave boss.

381
00:41:58,460 --> 00:41:59,130
I am coming too.

382
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,010
Ok bye.
- Bye.

383
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,580
- Hey
- Bye bye

384
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:03,440
Happy birthday.

385
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:05,950
Bye guys, drive safe.

386
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:09,080
Hey, no drinking and driving. Call a taxi.
- Ok Boss.

387
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:15,660
Watch out! Slowly.

388
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,640
Calamity comes slowly,
the whole world is behind Meena.

389
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:23,770
These beauty lovers wish for romance

390
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,590
You and your poetry... I will leave now

391
00:42:26,970 --> 00:42:27,880
Hey wait

392
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:29,980
Meena, it is too late.
- Shiva please wait.

393
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,610
Come on, let me go.
- Please.

394
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:35,530
Climate is not good, right?

395
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,700
Stay back here.

396
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:46,890
As a police officer I assure
you that I won't do you any harm

397
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:49,900
Shall I go for the kill?

398
00:42:50,570 --> 00:42:51,110
Go on.

399
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:54,820
Not you, but this mind of yours.

400
00:42:56,610 --> 00:42:59,950
It is always thinking of
something or the other.

401
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:02,200
You know what?

402
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:06,360
There is one more reason for my divorce.

403
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:08,030
What is that?

404
00:43:08,490 --> 00:43:10,110
I couldn't love him at all.

405
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:15,400
Meena, love just happens.

406
00:43:56,570 --> 00:43:59,690
Hello Prasad, is your head okay?

407
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:00,890
Hope you don't have a hangover!

408
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:04,090
What about John?

409
00:44:04,570 --> 00:44:06,820
He was late.
Hope his boss wasn't upset with him.

410
00:44:23,990 --> 00:44:26,900
You pick up the witness Swamy and
bring him to the court yourself.

411
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:27,740
Is that okay?

412
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:28,530
Okay.

413
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:31,320
Shivaji.
- What? Coming.

414
00:44:34,530 --> 00:44:35,240
Look there

415
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:43,490
Just wait here.

416
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,150
They killed Swamy and threw his body here.

417
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:31,740
Swamy's murder is planned
done by Pasari for sure.

418
00:45:33,110 --> 00:45:37,650
But as he was in the lockup at
that time, we cannot charge him.

419
00:45:38,490 --> 00:45:40,280
But why did they throw the body there?

420
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:45,490
To warn us that he can
do anything from anywhere.

421
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:51,360
I feel somebody is doing this
wantedly to trap Pasari.

422
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:54,700
Anyone would think Pasari is behind this.

423
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:59,610
Maybe the people doing
all of this intend us to think so?

424
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:15,530
Your honor, my client Mr. Narayan Pasari was
in jail when the murder of Swamy took place

425
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:17,320
Coming to the second matter,

426
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:22,550
The entire case of the Special Investigation
Team depends only on Swamy's witness.

427
00:46:23,490 --> 00:46:26,110
Now there is no Swamy and hence no witness.

428
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:31,430
As the prosecution could not prove
the allegations on Narayan Pasari,

429
00:46:32,070 --> 00:46:34,250
The court not only declares him as innocent.

430
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,530
but also orders the Police to
take him back into the department.

431
00:46:43,650 --> 00:46:45,240
I have already said,

432
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:48,360
whatever I did was for the system.

433
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:50,530
Truth is on my side.

434
00:46:51,490 --> 00:46:56,240
That Pasari did this along with Nakki gang.

435
00:46:56,780 --> 00:47:01,490
You do one thing, there is a common
rival for both Pasari and Nakki.

436
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:03,150
Underworld don kaana.

437
00:47:03,490 --> 00:47:05,860
You join hands with him.
I will arrange a meeting.

438
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:10,510
Should we take the help from an underworld
criminal to catch another one?

439
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:11,700
Nonsense!
- Eh!

440
00:47:12,110 --> 00:47:14,400
Don't talk cinematic.
Do what I say.

441
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:15,570
Understood?

442
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:17,780
Okay. Thanks for the advise.

443
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:20,240
So? What does this mean?

444
00:47:20,570 --> 00:47:21,740
What else dad?

445
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:24,570
They took Pasari back
again into the department.

446
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:28,610
They cancelled SIT as
my investigation failed.

447
00:47:29,530 --> 00:47:33,900
I, myself requested to post
me in Mumbai Crime branch.

448
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:35,610
Why?

449
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:39,860
Dad, it is my responsibility
to finish what I started.

450
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:42,400
Underworld is no more now.

451
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:48,320
The reason for that is because
I had finished it long back.

452
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:55,570
Every rich person in Mumbai is
living happily because of me.

453
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:00,990
Because I saved its prestige,

454
00:48:03,490 --> 00:48:08,400
The entire Police department
is moving with heads high.

455
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:10,070
It is because of me.

456
00:48:21,530 --> 00:48:24,450
This system has used me completely.

457
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:29,700
And threw me aside after that.

458
00:48:32,950 --> 00:48:35,650
But the idiots in the system
are unaware of something.

459
00:48:37,530 --> 00:48:39,780
That Pasari is not as much
of an idiot as they think he is.

460
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:42,700
They don't know.

461
00:48:50,610 --> 00:48:53,780
For risking my life wihtout any thought,

462
00:48:55,070 --> 00:48:59,700
If I accumulated some money, why
are these rascals so jealous?

463
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:14,930
Now this whole city will know what
will happen if Pasari is provoked.

464
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:17,990
I will form my own gang.

465
00:49:20,030 --> 00:49:24,900
That underworld gang will make
the whole city pee with fear.

466
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:03,700
Good morning sir.

467
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:08,280
Good morning sir.

468
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:19,240
Move back... Move it

469
00:50:39,070 --> 00:50:40,360
Is this the plan?
- Yes Sir.

470
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:49,030
Is this for the new unit?

471
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:49,860
Yes sir.

472
00:50:49,950 --> 00:50:51,820
When will it arrive?
- It would be delivered in the next month.

473
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:53,170
See that it is delivered in time.
- Okay sir.

474
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:55,530
And then these two..

475
00:51:16,070 --> 00:51:16,740
Sir.

476
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:25,350
Cut!

477
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:27,280
Hello sir.

478
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:28,950
Hi master, how is it going?

479
00:51:28,990 --> 00:51:29,780
It is going good sir.

480
00:51:30,030 --> 00:51:32,110
Tinku one more.
- Will the fight be done today?

481
00:51:32,150 --> 00:51:33,740
One more... It will be done sir.

482
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:08,710
Hit him.

483
00:52:21,570 --> 00:52:23,900
Today's news is not just news.

484
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:27,070
Breaking news that
will give you goosebumps

485
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:30,700
A spate of murders that
took place at the same time

486
00:52:31,050 --> 00:52:32,990
made the whole
country shiver in fear

487
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:38,450
Stunning fact is that Joint
Commissioner of Police GR Ramdas,

488
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:42,070
biggest film maker of Bollywood Adil Chopra

489
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:45,950
and biggest industrialist of the country
Sunil Singhania are among the dead.

490
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:49,860
And also Inter India Airlines
CEO Shahabuddin Ahmed

491
00:52:50,030 --> 00:52:53,110
and Angel five star hotel
owner Sethia are among the dead.

492
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:58,070
They say that the main reason behind these
murders is to ignite fear among the public.

493
00:52:59,570 --> 00:53:00,820
Not just me

494
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:06,490
Everyone including the government and public
thought that underworld is totally finished.

495
00:53:07,070 --> 00:53:09,550
But in the entire crime history of Mumbai,

496
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:13,760
No one would have witnessed
a chapter like this.

497
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:16,520
When compared with this
new underworld company,

498
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:20,190
all the crimes commited by the old
companies seem like child's play.

499
00:53:21,070 --> 00:53:23,710
After a discussion with the
Chief Minister this morning,

500
00:53:24,350 --> 00:53:25,880
The government has taken a decision.

501
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:32,900
That is to immediately form a special
squad to finish this new company.

502
00:53:33,450 --> 00:53:37,780
Mr. Narayan Pasari will be the
head of this special squad.

503
00:53:40,030 --> 00:53:44,820
because he has a great experience
in terminating the underworld.

504
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:47,020
In handling this matter,

505
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:53,950
we believe that there is no better
officer than him in the entire department.

506
00:53:54,450 --> 00:53:57,320
That is why he would
not only form a special squad

507
00:53:57,930 --> 00:54:00,320
but will also select
the members for it.

508
00:54:02,150 --> 00:54:07,780
The aim of this special squad is to
completely end this new company

509
00:54:09,150 --> 00:54:09,820
That's all.

510
00:54:15,570 --> 00:54:18,280
Sir, I have already selected
the special squad team.

511
00:54:20,570 --> 00:54:25,110
Neenak Joshi, Vasaab Malik, Chaitanya Dev,

512
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:30,740
Meer Kadam, Yakub Deewan

513
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:33,990
Shivaji Rao.

514
00:54:58,030 --> 00:54:59,950
Shivaji, your assumption is meaningless.

515
00:55:00,070 --> 00:55:03,820
Your doubt that Pasari is behind the
new company is really ridiculous.

516
00:55:04,550 --> 00:55:07,850
You are psyching yourself as the
case you filed on him failed.

517
00:55:08,860 --> 00:55:10,610
Pasari is an officer with an
extraordinary track record.

518
00:55:11,030 --> 00:55:15,620
I too believe that Pasari is the only person
who can save this city from that new company

519
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:17,790
Sorry

520
00:55:19,110 --> 00:55:20,320
Hope I did not disturb you.

521
00:55:21,530 --> 00:55:23,070
Not at all, please come sir.

522
00:55:34,650 --> 00:55:40,200
Shivaji, who do you think could
be behind this new company?

523
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:45,360
Who would know that better than you?

524
00:55:56,070 --> 00:55:57,490
Thanks for the compliment.

525
00:55:59,610 --> 00:56:03,320
By the way, do you know why I
took you into the special squad?

526
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:09,900
It is because I trust you.

527
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:13,950
I trust you more.

528
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:46,960
Sir, why did you take Shivaji
Rao into the special squad?

529
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:50,520
Bushim, we should keep our friends close.

530
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:53,940
and the enemies more closer.

531
00:56:55,770 --> 00:56:56,850
That is fine sir

532
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:00,270
but I do not understand one thing.

533
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:03,190
Why are you not killing Shivaji Rao?

534
00:57:05,150 --> 00:57:10,230
I wish to give more pain to him
than death for what he did to me.

535
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:12,310
Just wait and see.

536
00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:13,850
Revenge

537
00:57:19,310 --> 00:57:22,650
This is the work of someone who
wants revenge over the whole system.

538
00:57:23,350 --> 00:57:23,900
Who?

539
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:25,230
Pasari.

540
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:27,230
Pasari?

541
00:57:28,630 --> 00:57:29,850
But boss,

542
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:32,650
Whatever kind of person Pasari may be today,

543
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:37,850
Going by his track record I don't
think he would cross such limit.

544
00:57:40,150 --> 00:57:43,230
There would be both,
a god and a demon in every human

545
00:57:44,650 --> 00:57:49,150
Some situations that happened,
transformed Pasari into a demon.

546
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:53,650
Didn't I tell you? Did you listen? No.

547
00:57:54,730 --> 00:57:55,810
Keep watching

548
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:59,900
that Pasari will turn Mumbai city into hell.

549
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:06,310
Bhajarangi! I have no doubts in the matter
that Pasari is behind the new company.

550
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:10,730
But I need your help to finish it.

551
00:58:30,610 --> 00:58:32,230
Why did you call for me?

552
00:58:33,150 --> 00:58:35,310
Money is very bad Bajarangi.

553
00:58:36,350 --> 00:58:41,600
Before that ends us, we should finish it.

554
00:58:41,690 --> 00:58:44,100
Why have you called me here?

555
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:45,980
Money

556
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:47,190
What do you mean?

557
00:58:47,350 --> 00:58:50,770
The matter is safe till
the money is in the safe.

558
00:58:51,190 --> 00:58:57,190
But the moment humans learn to
earn it, this becomes a curse.

559
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:59,520
Then, we have to finish it.

560
00:58:59,770 --> 00:59:02,650
Say what you wish to say straight,
I don't have time.

561
00:59:07,150 --> 00:59:10,150
Bhajarangi,
you just have time alone with you.

562
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:14,060
You just swat flies all
day long in that warehouse.

563
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:17,810
You are even unable to
maintain both your families.

564
00:59:18,850 --> 00:59:20,730
What else do you have other than time?

565
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:23,900
Tell me

566
00:59:25,850 --> 00:59:28,900
Will you work along
with me and earn money?

567
00:59:29,150 --> 00:59:30,900
I am listening, tell me.

568
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:33,400
Shivaji

569
00:59:33,850 --> 00:59:36,770
We could meet again after
so long because of him

570
00:59:40,650 --> 00:59:45,480
Let us forget the past
and work together again.

571
00:59:46,190 --> 00:59:46,900
What do you say?

572
00:59:47,150 --> 00:59:49,560
What is the guarantee that
you will not cheat me again?

573
00:59:50,030 --> 00:59:53,980
Look Bajarangi, it is okay even
if you do not believe in my words.

574
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:59,020
But at least believe these bundles of notes.

575
01:00:02,310 --> 01:00:03,440
Think about it.

576
01:00:04,150 --> 01:00:06,020
I am anyhow burning all this money.

577
01:00:20,110 --> 01:00:23,770
Everyone is shivering in fear
listening to the happenings in Mumbai

578
01:00:24,070 --> 01:00:27,060
Son, listen to me. Please come back.

579
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:31,190
I cannot return back till the
people who started this are finished.

580
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:35,190
Son, they look like they want to
finish the whole city of Mumbai.

581
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:39,730
Look, anyway you had been on SIT
work and that anyways is not there now

582
01:00:40,810 --> 01:00:43,520
Listen to us and come back son.

583
01:00:43,770 --> 01:00:46,270
Dad, you are saying this in fear.

584
01:00:47,270 --> 01:00:49,850
Do you remember what you have
been saying since my childhood?

585
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:52,190
Life does not mean just living,

586
01:00:52,310 --> 01:00:54,480
animals, birds and insects live too.

587
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:58,190
But life is about living for what
you believe without any fear

588
01:00:59,020 --> 01:01:01,060
And now, it is you who is
trying to instill fear in me.

589
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:06,600
I am fighting for good,
truth and the justice I believe in.

590
01:01:07,060 --> 01:01:08,810
Please do not stop me.

591
01:01:13,990 --> 01:01:16,100
Dad, I will talk to you later

592
01:01:18,690 --> 01:01:19,350
Prasad.

593
01:01:19,770 --> 01:01:21,940
Sir, Pasari and Bhajarangi are together.

594
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:25,480
Both are cheaters.

595
01:01:26,310 --> 01:01:29,600
The security we put behind Bhajarangi
have witnessed them meeting.

596
01:01:34,690 --> 01:01:36,480
I have met Pasari.

597
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:39,810
Pasari has a thousand
eyes in the department.

598
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:44,940
Before he comes to know about
us, I have told him everything.

599
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:51,940
We will need to play a very
high level game to fight Pasari.

600
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:54,310
Come inside.

601
01:02:18,020 --> 01:02:20,020
Hey Pasari.

602
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:30,100
I told Shivaji whatever
you wanted me to tell him.

603
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:36,310
Poor Shivaji!

604
01:02:40,730 --> 01:02:43,980
By the way, I heard he has a daughter.

605
01:02:45,810 --> 01:02:47,020
She is very cute.

606
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:00,560
Daddy

607
01:03:02,650 --> 01:03:06,190
Do you know why I brought
you to Essel World suddenly?

608
01:03:07,270 --> 01:03:08,770
Today is your birthday.

609
01:03:10,060 --> 01:03:13,980
Daddy, I cannot be happy if you are serious.

610
01:03:14,770 --> 01:03:16,270
Please smile.

611
01:03:45,940 --> 01:03:46,980
Shalu.

612
01:03:47,420 --> 01:03:54,680
"I'm not happy when you are
not smiling as usual Daddy"

613
01:03:57,090 --> 01:04:01,410
"I will smile if you do"

614
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:05,740
"Let's play in the smiles daddy"

615
01:04:06,620 --> 01:04:10,900
"Smile should bloom like a flower everyday"

616
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:15,620
"Smile should ring like a bell everytime"

617
01:04:16,030 --> 01:04:20,430
"Smile, smile, smile always"

618
01:04:20,750 --> 01:04:24,610
"Smile, smile, keep smiling."

619
01:04:44,590 --> 01:04:50,500
"Smile is a raindrop
that reaches the hearts"

620
01:04:54,060 --> 01:04:59,980
"Smile is the happy feeling
that you feel in yourself"

621
01:05:04,030 --> 01:05:09,940
"A cool smile touches the
heart and spreads happiness"

622
01:05:13,830 --> 01:05:17,830
"Smile should bloom like a flower everyday"

623
01:05:18,660 --> 01:05:22,900
"Smile should ring like a bell everytime"

624
01:05:23,300 --> 01:05:27,650
"Smile, smile, smile always"

625
01:05:27,850 --> 01:05:32,150
"Smile, smile, keep smiling."

626
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:41,040
"Daddy, daddy"

627
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:06,940
Daddy!

628
01:06:26,310 --> 01:06:27,230
Daddy

629
01:08:00,690 --> 01:08:02,270
This way, come on let us go.

630
01:08:36,900 --> 01:08:37,900
Come on Shalu.

631
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:40,350
Move, move, move. Let's go.

632
01:09:26,850 --> 01:09:27,360
Come here

633
01:09:30,110 --> 01:09:30,650
You are okay?

634
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:33,230
Are you okay dear?

635
01:09:50,610 --> 01:09:52,230
You are hiding something from me.

636
01:09:53,310 --> 01:09:55,060
There was an attack on you to kill you.

637
01:09:56,270 --> 01:09:57,150
Who would have done it?

638
01:09:58,150 --> 01:09:59,310
Is it the new Company?

639
01:09:59,940 --> 01:10:00,600
Is it them?

640
01:10:01,770 --> 01:10:03,650
May be or may not be.

641
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:05,850
Still, what would you do if
you get to know about it?

642
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:09,850
Shivaji, are you hiding anything from me?

643
01:10:11,060 --> 01:10:13,150
May be or may not be.

644
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:22,190
Pasari will try to kill you 100%.

645
01:10:23,150 --> 01:10:25,260
We cannot even lodge a complaint
with the police this time.

646
01:10:26,190 --> 01:10:28,770
Because Pasari himself is
the police at this time.

647
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:32,480
Only underworld can save you from Pasari.

648
01:10:32,650 --> 01:10:34,430
Khana is Pasari's biggest enemy.

649
01:10:35,020 --> 01:10:39,180
And unlike Nakki who operates from outside,
he is running a gang from inside Mumbai

650
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:42,150
Bhajrangi has good contacts with him.

651
01:10:42,690 --> 01:10:44,440
He can arrange a meeting between you both.

652
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:50,770
Bhajarangi

653
01:11:12,940 --> 01:11:15,940
That new company belongs to Pasari for sure,

654
01:11:16,690 --> 01:11:18,440
but we cannot prove it.

655
01:11:19,150 --> 01:11:19,730
Then what do we do?

656
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:22,650
The only way is to kill him.

657
01:11:23,350 --> 01:11:24,560
It would be foolishness.

658
01:11:24,970 --> 01:11:25,620
You!
- Hey.

659
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:32,980
What is foolish in this?

660
01:11:33,650 --> 01:11:35,400
Pasari cannot manage all of this alone.

661
01:11:35,810 --> 01:11:37,770
There is an organization behind him.

662
01:11:38,020 --> 01:11:39,900
We should destroy that organization.

663
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:44,620
If we kill him, we would lose
the connection with that network.

664
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:48,940
He is not a mad guy dude.

665
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:52,100
Tell me

666
01:11:55,070 --> 01:11:57,230
We are on the opposite sides of law.

667
01:11:57,940 --> 01:12:01,400
But we both should be on one side
when it comes to finishing Pasari.

668
01:12:02,350 --> 01:12:06,350
I need your support to destroy his system.

669
01:12:08,190 --> 01:12:11,690
This is not madness

670
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:40,360
Daddy

671
01:12:42,990 --> 01:12:44,650
Any problem?

672
01:12:45,570 --> 01:12:46,400
No dear

673
01:12:47,190 --> 01:12:48,650
It is okay. Tell me.

674
01:12:58,780 --> 01:13:01,070
You are not old enough to know such things.

675
01:13:01,650 --> 01:13:03,230
Would something happen dad?

676
01:13:04,230 --> 01:13:04,940
I don't know.

677
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:08,650
Can't we return back to Hyderabad?

678
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:16,610
I cannot run away dear.

679
01:13:17,150 --> 01:13:19,280
Is it so necessary to do this job?

680
01:13:19,980 --> 01:13:21,860
It is not a job that I am doing now.

681
01:13:23,030 --> 01:13:25,320
I am fighting for the truth I believe in.

682
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:30,900
If something happens to me by chance,
grandpa and grandma will look after you.

683
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:33,730
Nothing will happen to you dad.

684
01:13:48,570 --> 01:13:50,350
The reason behind calling
all of you here is,

685
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:55,980
I got a confirmed information that
Khaana is the head of the new company.

686
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:03,820
Listen to my plan now

687
01:14:32,070 --> 01:14:34,860
Kaana, Pasari came to know
about the place you are at.

688
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:37,940
We are all coming there with
the squad to attack on you

689
01:14:38,690 --> 01:14:40,480
You flee from there with your men.

690
01:14:42,570 --> 01:14:46,610
Shivaji is really stupid.
He is asking us to flee.

691
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:52,070
We will not get a better
chance to kill Pasari than this.

692
01:14:52,990 --> 01:14:56,190
The new company and it's
people are Shivaji's problem

693
01:14:56,650 --> 01:14:58,440
We will kill Pasari.

694
01:15:02,650 --> 01:15:07,190
Pasari wants to finish
Kaana using his position.

695
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:12,110
Considering the rivalry between them
I doubt he will follow your advise

696
01:15:12,650 --> 01:15:17,190
Whatever it is, we need to save
Khaana from Pasari at any cost.

697
01:15:19,430 --> 01:15:20,280
We are ready sir

698
01:17:02,870 --> 01:17:03,550
Here, come on.

699
01:17:04,910 --> 01:17:05,380
Go that side.

700
01:17:32,780 --> 01:17:33,440
Go, go

701
01:18:43,230 --> 01:18:46,320
I will give you some more
pain before I kill you.

702
01:19:16,690 --> 01:19:17,820
Prasad

703
01:19:20,570 --> 01:19:21,780
He killed Kaana.

704
01:19:24,810 --> 01:19:25,400
What?

705
01:19:50,490 --> 01:19:51,090
Prasad

706
01:20:04,430 --> 01:20:06,070
I think Kaana has killed him.

707
01:20:15,860 --> 01:20:17,780
Kaana already died earlier.

708
01:20:29,750 --> 01:20:30,480
Meena

709
01:20:32,030 --> 01:20:36,640
I came to know about a few
shocking facts about Shivaji.

710
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:46,190
Shivaji is the reason for the death of
all our officers in the attack on Kaana.

711
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:47,780
Shivaji?

712
01:20:48,120 --> 01:20:50,190
I checked all the call records.

713
01:20:51,030 --> 01:20:53,190
Shivaji himself called and gave them a tip.

714
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:55,910
Look at this.

715
01:21:13,860 --> 01:21:16,900
Shivaji and Kaana together
started a new underworld company.

716
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:20,280
Now that Kaana is dead,
Shivaji is its leader of that company now.

717
01:21:20,570 --> 01:21:25,400
But, why would a sincere officer
like Shivaji befriend Kaana?

718
01:21:26,150 --> 01:21:30,980
Why does a Police officer need
to form an underworld gang?

719
01:21:31,430 --> 01:21:33,860
We will know that only after arresting him,
right?

720
01:21:50,780 --> 01:21:51,280
Hello

721
01:21:51,450 --> 01:21:54,700
Sir, Pasari is coming to arrest
you. Please leave from there urgently.

722
01:22:52,060 --> 01:22:55,450
He might be hinding in some room here.
Check all the rooms. Don't leave any place.

723
01:23:41,950 --> 01:23:45,230
Team B, come in.

724
01:23:49,530 --> 01:23:52,190
Shivaji, stop. All of you go that side.

725
01:24:25,950 --> 01:24:27,530
Shivaji stop.

726
01:24:36,900 --> 01:24:37,960
Shivaji, surrender.

727
01:24:47,780 --> 01:24:51,030
Come on try to arrest him.
Shoot him if that's not possible.

728
01:25:04,910 --> 01:25:06,280
All units alert.

729
01:25:06,370 --> 01:25:08,990
Shivaji is escaping from the back.
Catch him at any cost

730
01:25:34,570 --> 01:25:38,110
Is the Hyderabad police officer
Shivaji the chief of the new company?

731
01:25:38,390 --> 01:25:39,510
As per the information received,

732
01:25:39,930 --> 01:25:43,210
it is believed that Shivaji Rao
is the chief of that new company.

733
01:25:43,780 --> 01:25:47,230
But there is a need to know whether
this is an allegation or the truth

734
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:50,380
The news that he is running an underworld
company being a police officer,

735
01:25:50,640 --> 01:25:52,160
is shocking to everyone.

736
01:25:55,940 --> 01:25:58,110
Meena, I cannot surrender.

737
01:25:58,280 --> 01:26:00,650
Shivaji, listen to me and surrender.
Where are you?

738
01:26:01,400 --> 01:26:04,110
You know very well that no
one can escape from the police.

739
01:26:04,430 --> 01:26:06,250
Hey, don't tell me about the police.

740
01:26:06,580 --> 01:26:07,690
Stop it Shivaji.

741
01:26:08,030 --> 01:26:12,030
Tell me something,
is it you behind that new company?

742
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:15,650
Hey, what is the point in saying
yes or no if I don't prove it?

743
01:26:15,980 --> 01:26:18,150
I am telling you based on
the relationship between us

744
01:26:18,280 --> 01:26:22,190
Arrest that Bhajarangi and you will surely
get some information about that new company.

745
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:35,280
Bhajarangi

746
01:26:36,940 --> 01:26:39,610
I am unable to decide on one thing.

747
01:26:39,940 --> 01:26:42,780
Are you my person or Shivaji's person?

748
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:54,400
Anyway, you are an expert
at playing a double game

749
01:27:03,480 --> 01:27:05,360
My grandpa always used to say one thing.

750
01:27:05,570 --> 01:27:07,480
Grandpa, grandpa.

751
01:27:07,610 --> 01:27:09,150
Stop this nonsense and
come to the point directly.

752
01:27:09,530 --> 01:27:11,860
If by chance you have
any doubt in your heart,

753
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:13,230
Do not take a risk

754
01:27:13,430 --> 01:27:14,280
So don't take it.

755
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:17,320
And thus, fly away oh parrot.

756
01:27:17,860 --> 01:27:20,730
Fly away, oh parrot

757
01:27:24,780 --> 01:27:26,820
The tiny parrot has flown away.

758
01:27:27,530 --> 01:27:29,330
It is in a hurry to fly away.

759
01:27:44,150 --> 01:27:46,150
Sir, Pasari has killed Bajarangi.

760
01:27:47,530 --> 01:27:48,190
I've heard about it.

761
01:27:50,860 --> 01:27:51,820
Where is Shalu?

762
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:53,980
She is right here sir, talk to her.

763
01:27:56,110 --> 01:27:58,480
Daddy, where are you and how are you?

764
01:27:58,570 --> 01:28:00,150
Shalu, sorry dear

765
01:28:00,360 --> 01:28:04,320
I had to bring you out from the hostel
fearing that they might harm you.

766
01:28:04,530 --> 01:28:08,450
I understood that dad,
but about the talk on you in the TV

767
01:28:08,650 --> 01:28:09,120
Shalu

768
01:28:09,900 --> 01:28:13,510
you will hear much more than what you
heard till now about me in the coming days.

769
01:28:14,030 --> 01:28:19,230
The very department I dedicated my whole
life for is now branding me as a criminal.

770
01:28:20,690 --> 01:28:23,610
But after they see what
I will do from now on,

771
01:28:24,030 --> 01:28:28,690
even the ones who trapped me into
this would look lesser dangerous.

772
01:28:28,900 --> 01:28:30,980
Daddy, I am scared.

773
01:28:33,320 --> 01:28:35,650
Shalu, do you trust me?

774
01:28:35,980 --> 01:28:37,230
More than yourself.

775
01:28:51,730 --> 01:28:55,230
If you don't answer to
every question I ask,

776
01:28:58,650 --> 01:29:01,530
My next punch would kill you.

777
01:29:42,280 --> 01:29:45,190
Your red light will never turn green now.

778
01:29:57,370 --> 01:29:59,070
I need a few answers.

779
01:30:04,820 --> 01:30:06,610
By the time you woke up and
come out of your sleepiness,

780
01:30:09,360 --> 01:30:11,280
the moment of your death arrived.

781
01:30:19,980 --> 01:30:22,230
He killed five special squad officers.

782
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:26,610
What more proofs do you need to say that
Shivaji is the head of the new company?

783
01:30:27,650 --> 01:30:30,030
Special squad is the new company

784
01:30:32,110 --> 01:30:32,650
Yes.

785
01:30:33,190 --> 01:30:37,030
all the officers other than
us belong to the new company

786
01:30:38,110 --> 01:30:40,820
That is the reason I have killed
some of them after investigation.

787
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:43,150
Shivaji, are you out of your mind?

788
01:30:43,380 --> 01:30:45,530
Meena, no need to believe me.

789
01:30:46,030 --> 01:30:48,280
I sent you a few documents and evidence.

790
01:30:48,570 --> 01:30:50,690
Study those and start the investigation.

791
01:30:51,690 --> 01:30:53,190
Tap everyone's phones,

792
01:30:54,190 --> 01:30:54,980
including mine.

793
01:30:56,150 --> 01:31:00,070
No one except Shivaji knows
that we are the new company.

794
01:31:01,490 --> 01:31:04,530
We have to kill Shivaji
before this news gets out.

795
01:31:05,010 --> 01:31:08,110
Kill anyone if required during this process.

796
01:31:14,310 --> 01:31:16,170
Hey. What is this man?
- Come on walk.

797
01:31:16,500 --> 01:31:17,680
Leave me.
- Walk.

798
01:31:18,610 --> 01:31:19,610
I said leave me.

799
01:31:20,390 --> 01:31:21,240
Sit.
- Jenny

800
01:31:21,780 --> 01:31:22,280
Son

801
01:31:22,860 --> 01:31:25,280
Do not move.

802
01:31:25,320 --> 01:31:27,650
I beg you, do not harm my son.

803
01:31:27,740 --> 01:31:28,860
Pasari, leave my son.

804
01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:30,650
Pasari, I'm telling you.

805
01:31:32,490 --> 01:31:34,610
Pasari, I am telling you.

806
01:31:35,610 --> 01:31:37,080
It will lead to bad circumstances.
Don't do it Pasari.

807
01:31:37,860 --> 01:31:39,320
Pasari no, leave my son.

808
01:31:39,740 --> 01:31:40,700
Leave my son.

809
01:31:41,200 --> 01:31:44,900
No...no... Pasari... Pasari...

810
01:31:45,320 --> 01:31:45,990
Pasari.

811
01:31:46,240 --> 01:31:47,990
Pasari, no.

812
01:31:48,280 --> 01:31:49,860
No, do not harm my son

813
01:31:50,200 --> 01:31:52,950
Pasari, do not harm my son

814
01:31:53,610 --> 01:31:56,530
Pasari, I will kill you

815
01:32:04,780 --> 01:32:06,900
I dont waste my time giving warnings.

816
01:32:07,320 --> 01:32:10,110
I need Shalu to catch Shivaji.

817
01:32:12,990 --> 01:32:15,240
If you do not act as I say,

818
01:32:18,150 --> 01:32:21,950
it is not the finger but his
head that will be cut next

819
01:32:28,580 --> 01:32:30,030
John, tell me.

820
01:32:31,320 --> 01:32:34,240
Sir, I doubt that my phone is tapped.

821
01:32:35,030 --> 01:32:36,900
I think they also discovered
Shalu's whereabouts.

822
01:32:37,820 --> 01:32:39,570
You immediately take Shalu away from there.

823
01:32:41,900 --> 01:32:42,570
Ok sir.

824
01:32:51,650 --> 01:32:54,240
Shalu, listen carefully.

825
01:32:54,700 --> 01:32:57,950
Start from there immediately and come
down to the last bus stop in Gandhi road.

826
01:32:59,200 --> 01:33:00,200
I will meet you there.

827
01:33:02,900 --> 01:33:03,780
Ok daddy.

828
01:33:17,530 --> 01:33:19,450
Pasari, leave both of them now.

829
01:33:32,620 --> 01:33:33,450
Yadav

830
01:33:35,900 --> 01:33:36,990
follow her.

831
01:33:54,580 --> 01:33:55,520
Shalu is on the move.

832
01:34:01,820 --> 01:34:04,940
Be alert..
Shivaji might not fall so easily in our trap

833
01:34:41,660 --> 01:34:45,570
Shoot him the moment he comes near
the girl. It's ok if you kill the girl too.

834
01:34:52,070 --> 01:34:54,280
Shalu, here. This way.

835
01:34:54,450 --> 01:34:55,120
Get in fast, come on.

836
01:34:58,890 --> 01:35:00,360
Oh no.
- Oh.

837
01:35:16,620 --> 01:35:17,680
Come on. Go fast.

838
01:35:30,740 --> 01:35:32,110
Come on. Fast, fast.

839
01:35:40,720 --> 01:35:41,120
Hey.

840
01:35:49,170 --> 01:35:50,190
Move, move.

841
01:36:33,300 --> 01:36:34,490
Daddy.

842
01:38:01,800 --> 01:38:03,490
Shalu, come dear.

843
01:38:06,200 --> 01:38:07,950
You are ok?
- Yes daddy

844
01:38:52,190 --> 01:38:53,400
Vikram, stay down

845
01:38:53,860 --> 01:38:55,630
Shalu fast, come on

846
01:39:42,370 --> 01:39:43,570
Come on, come on.

847
01:39:45,690 --> 01:39:49,240
Shalu, just listen to me.
Don't move from here. Okay?

848
01:40:28,500 --> 01:40:30,950
For what you did to me,

849
01:40:32,950 --> 01:40:34,860
for what you did to this city

850
01:40:36,610 --> 01:40:40,740
and above all for what
you did to our department,

851
01:40:41,990 --> 01:40:43,820
I am not just killing you

852
01:40:44,820 --> 01:40:47,650
But I am going to give you
an unbearable punishment

853
01:40:53,700 --> 01:40:59,950
You think I will just fold my hands like
a child and take the punishment you give me?

854
01:41:00,480 --> 01:41:01,770
I will be disappointed.

855
01:41:03,080 --> 01:41:04,880
The more you resist,

856
01:41:07,330 --> 01:41:09,790
My punch would grow harder.

857
01:44:22,040 --> 01:44:23,260
Daddy...
- Shalu

858
01:44:40,020 --> 01:44:43,290
Hey, see how I will kill you.

859
01:45:00,320 --> 01:45:01,360
Shalu

860
01:45:24,910 --> 01:45:27,010
I will kill you. I will kill you.

861
01:47:11,530 --> 01:47:14,200
How much more punishment will you give?
Kill me.

862
01:47:19,840 --> 01:47:24,280
I need to finish your
entire company using you.

863
01:47:47,190 --> 01:47:48,500
"Officer"

864
01:47:50,260 --> 01:47:52,390
"He is an officer"

865
01:47:54,670 --> 01:47:56,120
"Officer"

866
01:47:57,710 --> 01:47:59,870
"He is an officer"
