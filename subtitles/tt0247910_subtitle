00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,718
Hello, Ms. Asha!!

2
00:03:40,753 --> 00:03:41,720
Hello!

3
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:54,199
We are very proud to announce
that the famous writer, Asha Shri...

4
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:58,936
has come here on the release
of her 50th book...

5
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:04,332
on the behalf of publisher Agarwal,
you all and myself...

6
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:06,745
I would like to welcome her!

7
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:25,554
Ms. Asha has covered all
aspects of a woman's life...

8
00:04:25,965 --> 00:04:29,093
through her stories,
novels and plays!

9
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:33,369
We are sure that our sisters must
have been very inspired with them!

10
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:37,139
Ms. Asha's novel 'Parikrama',
is very close to her life.

11
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:42,207
I would like publisher Agarwal to
present this book to Ms. Asha...

12
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:46,051
and would also like her to speak
few words on this occasion!

13
00:04:54,827 --> 00:04:55,794
Thank you.

14
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:06,500
I am very thankful to
everyone for honoring me!

15
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:11,803
I've been asked to speak something
but I don't know what to say.

16
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:16,081
I've expressed a lot in my books...

17
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:22,046
in fact, this book
is my autobiography.

18
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:26,549
But there is something
which I could never say...

19
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:30,156
nor write, I would like to
say it today!

20
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:36,158
There is some story
behind every person...

21
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:39,162
and there are memories hidden
in the depths of the heart!

22
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:43,137
But there is no outlet
to these moments!

23
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:47,642
My memories would have
yet been within me...

24
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:51,448
if my friend, Mr. Alok would
have not helped me to...

25
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:54,853
traverse on the path of my memories!

26
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:59,614
I would like to uncover
this story of my life...

27
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:03,187
in front of my friend!
Please come here, Mr. Alok.

28
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:32,289
On the banks of Ganga, in village
Basantpur I had a small house...

29
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:35,894
my mother, father, grandmother,
lived there...

30
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:38,890
along with their pet child,
Nisha, that is me!

31
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:44,562
I have very faint memories of that
place because, till I grew up...

32
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:48,304
our entire village
was wiped out in a flood!

33
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:55,904
Everything was over! Only a few
handful escaped & I was one of them!

34
00:06:56,682 --> 00:06:59,913
On hearing this news, my maternal
uncle took me home along with him.

35
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:04,111
But frankly speaking, that place
was never a home for me!

36
00:07:04,957 --> 00:07:09,155
Because, I was just a burden for
my aunt and her daughter, Indu!

37
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:12,595
My aunt was a selfish and
a hot-tempered lady...

38
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:17,925
and Indu could go to any extents
to satisfy her wishes and fads!

39
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:20,931
I had only one close friend, Abha!

40
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:26,603
She too was getting married
and going far away from me!

41
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,967
Get down carefully!

42
00:07:58,711 --> 00:08:00,679
And this is for
my sister-in-law's friends!

43
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:05,313
Watch out!

44
00:08:15,361 --> 00:08:17,989
You'll can't take it? All right,
I'll make it easier for you all.

45
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:24,795
Don't use your hand, even
I can snatch it from his mouth!

46
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:28,199
Come on, try it now!

47
00:08:35,147 --> 00:08:38,310
Wow! This girl has
really taken a bold decision!

48
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:39,685
No, Indu!!

49
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:59,034
- Congratulations, Indu!
- How did you know my name?

50
00:09:00,072 --> 00:09:02,700
Kabir is very learned
when it comes to women!

51
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:06,044
He sees a woman and knows everything
about her! He's an astrologer!

52
00:09:06,412 --> 00:09:10,644
Actually, when you were taking the
money, someone called out your name.

53
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:14,052
- She was my sister!
- What is her name?

54
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:20,047
- We've to go and meet sister-in-law!
- Oh yes, let's go!

55
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:23,721
- Girls, who wants this tenner?
- Nobody!

56
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:26,189
All right then I'll keep it!

57
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:33,270
Mother, he is so good looking that
you can't help watching him!

58
00:09:34,807 --> 00:09:40,074
He is so handsome that
you just cannot forget his face!

59
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,305
He looks like a prince!

60
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:48,719
And someone said
that he is a very rich man.

61
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:52,549
He was completely besotted by me!

62
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:57,391
Keep away from these rich men!
They just know how to have fun!

63
00:09:57,897 --> 00:10:01,697
Mother, I am not a child that I
cannot understand a man's intentions!

64
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:06,764
I am confident that one day, he'll
come here to ask for my hand!

65
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:10,835
That's good, what more would we ask
for if we get such a good proposal!

66
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:15,704
Aunty, Abha's parents have invited
few guests home for dinner...

67
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:18,514
she wanted me to go there
early to help them out.

68
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:21,717
That means, even he'll be there!
I will also come with you!

69
00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:27,421
Nisha, take her along and
try to assess the boy properly!

70
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:32,130
Sister, please try to
fix up something!

71
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:39,399
There was a man in our village...

72
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:43,933
in a marriage procession,
he'd stand in front of the groom.

73
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:46,470
To bless the groom?
- Right...

74
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:49,938
he'd tell the groom 'you fool!
Climb down from the horse's back...

75
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:54,548
you'll cry all your life,
it's not yet late, come down! '

76
00:10:56,088 --> 00:11:00,149
See, even he is laughing, he's a new
groom, but he too will cry later!

77
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:07,460
Shall I come along?

78
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:14,566
- How are you?
- So far, so good.

79
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:20,167
But I think this beauty
is going to injure someone today!

80
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:23,511
And perhaps, I'm the fortunate one.

81
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:26,908
Your cousin has not come along?

82
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:30,413
Sister? She loves
being in the kitchen!

83
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:33,588
There she is!

84
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:47,863
Why do you always keep working?
Come with me!

85
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:51,209
Sister in law, this is wrong!

86
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:53,706
- Why?
- I wish...

87
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:58,210
- you'd care so much about me too!
- I cannot compare you with Nisha!

88
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:02,815
That is true, I cannot
be compared with her!

89
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:08,921
God has taken lot of efforts in
making her but he missed one thing.

90
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:13,025
- What is that?
- He made her dumb!

91
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:18,359
Mr Kabir, my friend not only
has a sweet voice...

92
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:22,499
but also a heart
which is extremely sensitive!

93
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:27,344
She has brains that can turn
feelings into poems or stories.

94
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,042
- Really?
- Of course.

95
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:32,873
Nisha, why don't you
sing that prize winning song?

96
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:34,445
Come on!

97
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:34,285
Chief, this Singapuri has
sent a series of letters!

98
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:38,259
I've never heard
of that name before!

99
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:44,102
I mean the Singapore beauty whom...
- I promised to marry?

100
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:49,132
Forget the marriage but at least,
write to her a couple of lines.

101
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:53,102
- I think this girl will...
- I don't care about them!

102
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:58,983
I remember them only till
the time they are in my arms!

103
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:01,519
Wow! What a fragrance!

104
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:06,656
But chief, for how long
will you keep flitting around?

105
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:12,020
Raman, one has to very carefully
choose a life partner.

106
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:16,898
I want to find a wife
who is beautiful...

107
00:17:17,302 --> 00:17:21,295
and very understanding in regards
to her husband's personal life...

108
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:24,870
which means, no nagging
or questioning!

109
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:29,874
Now I understand!
You really are great!

110
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:35,151
- That's okay!
- But who are you going to meet now?

111
00:17:35,587 --> 00:17:40,547
- The one at the party last night.
- Oh! She was just terrific!

112
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:43,557
- Enough! Don't open your
mouth there, come!

113
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:47,564
And don't try to explain them
the meaning of your name.

114
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:50,226
- Yes, aunty?
- You did not tell me about lunch.

115
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:53,765
- We'll eat outside.
- Yes, it's a special day!

116
00:18:05,617 --> 00:18:08,108
Mother, look who is here!

117
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:12,582
- She's so pretty!
- Don't say a word more!

118
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:16,594
Why are you standing there son,
please come in!

119
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:20,192
Greetings! My name is Kabir Suri.

120
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:24,193
I know it! Who is he?

121
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:26,934
He's my close pal,
Radha Raman Goswami!

122
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:31,871
You don't need to tell
them my full name!

123
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:36,110
- Can we come in, aunty?
- Sure, let's go inside!

124
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:38,411
- Please come!
- All right!

125
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:47,750
I am very close to Kabir and
people lovingly call me Raman!

126
00:18:48,727 --> 00:18:52,356
Indu, do you know what Raman means?

127
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:56,628
- No!
- What? How is that possible?

128
00:18:57,069 --> 00:19:01,972
That's very strange!
Raman means 'keli'!

129
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:07,310
She has yet not understood.
Aunty, you are experienced...

130
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,739
you surely must be knowing
the meaning of 'keli'.

131
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:16,052
I am sure he means those tiny
bananas, I really like them a lot!

132
00:19:16,421 --> 00:19:19,857
- Bananas?!
- Yes, the tiny ones!

133
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:24,294
No, 'keli' doesn't mean bananas...

134
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:28,188
it means a small,
light hearted romance!

135
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:32,661
It means an affair, my name
means 'to have an affair! '

136
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:37,270
Oh! So this is what your name means?
- Yes, this is the meaning!

137
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:39,677
Your parents have kept
a very wrong name!

138
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,972
- Why?
- See...

139
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:45,815
how shy my Indu is feeling
listening to your name!

140
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:48,353
Then I am sure she must be
remembering her lover...

141
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,211
and why shouldn't she, after all,
he is in front of her!

142
00:19:51,723 --> 00:19:54,692
- Yes, chief?
- Stop this nonsense and sit here!

143
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:57,118
As you please. I am sorry, ladies!

144
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:02,427
- Son, who all are in your family?
- My family? Oh, his!

145
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:07,932
I am alone but with your blessings,
your daughter will soon be with me!

146
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:14,701
I am sure you've done some good
deeds to get a son in law like him!

147
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,412
He has a very successful
business of books...

148
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:20,115
he has his own press
and 5-6 flats...

149
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:22,385
and he lives in a palatial bungalow!

150
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:27,315
Kabir, where is the farm
where you go for fresh air?

151
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:29,727
It's around 40-50 kilometers
from here.

152
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:33,396
Aunty, all that I lack is
the person to take care of me...

153
00:20:33,765 --> 00:20:37,326
if I had a family, I would have not
come here to speak to you!

154
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:40,567
- Son, don't feel disheartened.
- Yes chief, that too in my presence.

155
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:45,842
To tell you the truth, I've been
dying with tension...

156
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,406
to find a beautiful
and a cultured girl...

157
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:53,149
who would save my innocent
friend's house from being ruined!

158
00:20:55,787 --> 00:21:02,750
When I saw your daughter, I knew she
was the right girl for my friend!

159
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:04,757
Did I goof up?

160
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:12,167
- Greetings!
- Greetings! Where are you going?

161
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:14,766
- I've some work.
- Something here is more important.

162
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,164
Please wait here!

163
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:20,437
Aunty, I like your daughter,
Nisha...

164
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:23,440
I had come here to ask for her hand!

165
00:21:37,562 --> 00:21:38,961
You go inside!

166
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:42,799
Son, Nisha is not my daughter.

167
00:21:43,835 --> 00:21:45,928
She is my deceased
sister in law's daughter!

168
00:21:46,838 --> 00:21:48,806
What is the difference between
a daughter and a niece?

169
00:21:49,174 --> 00:21:51,142
And when Kabir has asked for her
hand then she is not an orphan!

170
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:53,137
Come on, accept this proposal.

171
00:21:53,578 --> 00:21:56,445
I cannot give my consent until
I don't speak to her uncle!

172
00:21:56,848 --> 00:22:01,342
You can talk to him, we'll come
again on next Sunday, good bye!

173
00:22:01,753 --> 00:22:04,051
Keep the sweets ready
on next Sunday!

174
00:22:04,856 --> 00:22:06,824
Chief, you really made
a great choice!

175
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,824
Child, don't get disheartened...

176
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:13,464
this was fated.

177
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:22,974
Yes mother, this was fated...

178
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:27,843
but mother, I cannot tolerate this.

179
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:34,846
I'll never forget the humiliation
I had to go through because of her!

180
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:39,522
Forget it child, girl's are
born with their destiny!

181
00:22:39,891 --> 00:22:43,657
And perhaps, you are destined
to have someone better than him!

182
00:22:44,062 --> 00:22:49,523
We should feel happy that an orphan
is getting married in a rich family!

183
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:51,869
She'll always be happy!

184
00:22:53,772 --> 00:22:57,606
You're concerned about her welfare,
whereas, we'll be rotting here...

185
00:22:57,976 --> 00:23:00,877
and that madam,
she killed my desires...

186
00:23:01,246 --> 00:23:06,206
and will be living like a queen,
I won't be able to bear this!

187
00:23:06,651 --> 00:23:10,883
It's not wise to fight
someone else's destiny!

188
00:23:13,024 --> 00:23:17,484
Child, understand that if once the
doors of the rich family open to us...

189
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:19,897
then we all can live very happily!

190
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:24,568
Mother, there is a vast difference
in your and my understanding.

191
00:23:25,203 --> 00:23:30,140
I feel as if I've been cheated
by someone close to me!

192
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:42,076
Nisha, there is nothing to
worry or think about!

193
00:23:42,687 --> 00:23:44,917
Every girl has to go through
this experience once in a lifetime!

194
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:47,515
I cannot get hold
of the situation, Abha.

195
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:53,929
It feels as if a prince
from the fairy tales...

196
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:58,930
has come on a horse and waved
his magic wand on a statue...

197
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:01,339
made me a queen
and has taken me along!

198
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:03,905
Nisha, you are crazy,
why don't you understand?

199
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:07,608
What should I understand?
Hearing aunt's talks, I feel...

200
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:11,073
she wants to marry me there so that
they are linked to a rich family...

201
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,613
which in return can prove to be
a beneficial deal for the family!

202
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:19,184
Forget about them! Once you get
married, don't associate with them!

203
00:24:19,991 --> 00:24:23,256
I am very glad that you are
getting such a nice husband.

204
00:24:23,728 --> 00:24:26,219
He's my husband's close pal
and he praises him a lot!

205
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:28,631
But Abha, I don't even know him.

206
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,195
Now don't think too much...

207
00:24:31,736 --> 00:24:36,298
by marrying Kabir, you'll begin
a new chapter in your life!

208
00:24:36,741 --> 00:24:40,609
A beautiful chapter! For my
sake dear, please don't refuse!

209
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:44,782
You are the closest to me
in this whole world.

210
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:49,646
If you think this is right then
I give me consent too!

211
00:24:51,022 --> 00:24:52,580
Come, let me hug you!

212
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:06,202
Daughter in law!

213
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,338
Aunty, what is this?

214
00:25:11,743 --> 00:25:15,679
Son, the Goddess of this house
cannot enter inside without rituals.

215
00:25:16,114 --> 00:25:19,015
Child, place your feet in this.

216
00:25:43,608 --> 00:25:46,702
We got married in haste
besides, I live alone...

217
00:25:47,078 --> 00:25:49,842
that is why, I've bought
whatever I felt was right!

218
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,273
Look at this!

219
00:26:02,794 --> 00:26:04,056
Why did you get this?

220
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:07,732
I thought of gifting you at least
one thing that I like the most!

221
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,727
How did you find this shawl?

222
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:14,071
This is just not a shawl,
it's your love.

223
00:26:17,108 --> 00:26:23,069
I wish, our life passes away
in these moments of love!

224
00:26:25,016 --> 00:26:31,387
I don't know of the next birth but
this one will surely be full of love!

225
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:43,090
- Aunty, we are... here she is!
- May no evil eye cast upon you both!

226
00:26:43,468 --> 00:26:46,904
- You look like Lord Ram and Seeta.
- Really? Let's go!

227
00:26:47,305 --> 00:26:50,672
Son, tell me what to
cook for tonight?

228
00:26:51,076 --> 00:26:54,375
Aunty, from now on, she's in charge
of this, please free me!

229
00:26:56,214 --> 00:26:59,445
Aunty, from now on, you please
stop worrying about food!

230
00:26:59,818 --> 00:27:02,116
- I will cook myself.
- You?

231
00:27:02,854 --> 00:27:05,118
Aunty, please don't be
so formal with me!

232
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:08,120
Nisha, hurry up,
we are getting late.

233
00:27:08,493 --> 00:27:09,460
Bye.

234
00:27:13,064 --> 00:27:16,693
Here is your salad,
what shall I do next?

235
00:27:17,235 --> 00:27:20,636
Now you go and rest for some time.

236
00:27:21,072 --> 00:27:24,473
Will you do all
the work by yourself?

237
00:27:24,876 --> 00:27:29,506
You've been working since many years
and to tell you frankly...

238
00:27:29,914 --> 00:27:33,873
I feel very good to
cook myself and feed him!

239
00:27:34,252 --> 00:27:38,154
- May God bless you!
- Okay, now you go and rest!

240
00:27:38,923 --> 00:27:44,657
I wonder how such a cultured girl
exists in today's day and age!

241
00:27:51,202 --> 00:27:57,437
Go and take wash, change
and then have your dinner.

242
00:27:57,909 --> 00:28:03,506
No, that's wrong, I shouldn't
waste my time on food.

243
00:28:04,816 --> 00:28:08,513
- That means you are not hungry?
- I am very hungry!

244
00:28:08,953 --> 00:28:11,353
- Then, come on, start!
- Let's start!

245
00:28:11,823 --> 00:28:14,383
- Sit down!
- Not here!

246
00:28:25,236 --> 00:28:29,935
Nisha, why are you always
involved in domestic chores?

247
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,536
We have many servants in the house
to take care of all that.

248
00:28:33,945 --> 00:28:36,209
From now on, you will be
busy with these things.

249
00:28:36,948 --> 00:28:40,907
See this, the welfare society has
started a home for the women.

250
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:47,224
The name of this place is 'Aadhaar',
you have to inaugurate that place!

251
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:21,449
I would like to say
a few words to my sisters...

252
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:24,459
who have come to
the refuge of 'Aadhaar'.

253
00:29:25,363 --> 00:29:29,265
Sister, by coming here, please
don't feel that you are helpless!

254
00:29:30,168 --> 00:29:35,037
Don't think you are a criminal and
you have to go through a sentence.

255
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,706
It's not like that, please forget
whatever happened in your past...

256
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:44,070
and start a new life
with dedication and faith!

257
00:29:44,482 --> 00:29:48,009
I am sure you will achieve success!

258
00:29:52,323 --> 00:29:56,885
An idol of a Goddess kept in temple
or home is not a symbol of strength...

259
00:29:57,328 --> 00:30:04,291
in fact, you're the strength, in you
is the strength to work and endure!

260
00:30:05,336 --> 00:30:11,639
Recognize your strengths & don't
think of this place only as a home...

261
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:18,210
consider it as an instrument which
will take you to your destination!

262
00:30:20,351 --> 00:30:24,651
Good! We thought, like others,
you'd also just cut the red ribbon.

263
00:30:25,056 --> 00:30:27,115
But your speech was too good!

264
00:30:38,369 --> 00:30:42,100
Yes, tell me... yes, she is
there, I'll call her!

265
00:30:43,107 --> 00:30:45,575
Child, there is a call for you.

266
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,673
- It's his call, isn't it?
- Yes, it is.

267
00:30:54,085 --> 00:30:57,350
Come home from wherever you are!
I am making your favorite dish!

268
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:01,358
I am not destined to eat that dish!

269
00:31:03,394 --> 00:31:06,693
You cook so well that along with
your hand, I feel like kissing you!

270
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:11,368
If there is an educated cook at
home, you need to praise her!

271
00:31:14,138 --> 00:31:18,006
Nisha, I am in Delhi, I have to
attend to some important matters.

272
00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:22,038
- Suddenly?!
- Yes, I do everything suddenly.

273
00:31:22,914 --> 00:31:29,945
I met you also suddenly. Tomorrow
is Holi, I'll celebrate it with you!

274
00:31:30,421 --> 00:31:34,050
Invite all friends
and also call Indu.

275
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:49,970
From now on, all the festivals will
be marked in your personal file?

276
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:57,806
Forget about her,
you are my confidential file!

277
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:03,951
- You are close to me now.
- And what about your married life?

278
00:32:05,156 --> 00:32:11,026
You're naive! Married men play more
safe in regards to their marriage!

279
00:32:11,462 --> 00:32:14,431
Besides, they do get a caretaker
to run their home!

280
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:17,825
That is why, I married
a very domesticated girl!

281
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:20,760
- Did you understand, my love?
- Yes, I have.

282
00:32:21,205 --> 00:32:23,230
Different facets of a man
is worth an applaud!

283
00:32:23,474 --> 00:32:27,433
That is why I say that
a man is born free!

284
00:36:52,977 --> 00:36:57,107
Doctor, I was feeling strange
since past two months.

285
00:36:57,515 --> 00:36:59,483
Your pregnancy is
confirmed, Mrs. Kabir.

286
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:01,718
Congratulations! Come with me.

287
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:10,718
There is no doubt in your pregnancy
but your case is little complicated.

288
00:37:16,767 --> 00:37:18,132
Please come, Mr. Kabir.

289
00:37:23,674 --> 00:37:25,733
You are going to be a father!

290
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:29,402
Father?! Nisha,
why didn't you tell...

291
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:34,077
But Mr. Kabir, you'll have to take
good care of her till her delivery.

292
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:38,419
Complete rest, no climbing
steps and eating out

293
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:42,748
I've prescribed few medicines,
there is no other problem.

294
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,763
Aunty, why are you worried?

295
00:37:57,808 --> 00:38:01,767
There are servants for the domestic
chores, we'll hire a nurse for Nisha.

296
00:38:02,813 --> 00:38:06,579
Why, doesn't she have a family
that you require to hire a nurse?

297
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:09,784
When will my services be of use,
isn't it, sister?

298
00:38:11,522 --> 00:38:13,490
That's right, after
her graduation she is at home...

299
00:38:13,824 --> 00:38:15,792
instead of staying there,
she'll stay here!

300
00:38:18,529 --> 00:38:20,861
Son, she's a very
compassionate girl.

301
00:38:21,532 --> 00:38:23,693
But aunty, how will you
manage the house alone?

302
00:38:24,101 --> 00:38:28,128
No more discussions, it's done!
So you tell me...

303
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:31,239
when are you coming here
to light up our house?

304
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:34,873
Let her stay from today,
I'll send her clothes later.

305
00:38:35,279 --> 00:38:38,612
Mother, you are saying as if
sister has dearth of clothes.

306
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:44,477
All my clothes are yours
excepting for one shawl.

307
00:38:45,856 --> 00:38:47,824
Is it a special shawl?

308
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:53,824
It's your brother-in-law's
first gift. It is priceless for me!

309
00:38:54,598 --> 00:39:00,059
Before she changes her mind, you
give the charge of the house to Indu.

310
00:39:00,871 --> 00:39:02,236
I'll be right back.

311
00:39:03,607 --> 00:39:08,169
Aunty, you have wiped out
my worries by leaving Indu here!

312
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:11,912
- I've not done any favor on you!
- Indu, come here!

313
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:14,914
Yes sister, tell me.

314
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:20,987
Take this and handle it carefully!

315
00:39:23,627 --> 00:39:28,462
My dear sister, until you
don't get your baby...

316
00:39:28,899 --> 00:39:31,868
you will be imprisoned
in this room, downstairs.

317
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:35,672
My worries are over
with your presence.

318
00:39:36,307 --> 00:39:40,437
Or else, I would keep
worrying about his needs.

319
00:39:40,811 --> 00:39:46,545
In a couple of days I'll know
everything about his needs.

320
00:39:46,917 --> 00:39:54,653
That can be done later but tell me
what do I need at the moment?

321
00:39:55,092 --> 00:40:00,894
- Please order, sir.
- I need a hot cup of tea!

322
00:40:01,432 --> 00:40:02,899
I'll get it right away!

323
00:40:13,644 --> 00:40:16,909
- Yes?
- Oh sorry, I forgot!

324
00:40:17,348 --> 00:40:19,908
- I'll get used to it in a few days.
- But what is the matter?

325
00:40:20,651 --> 00:40:24,052
- There is no button here!
- I'll be back in a moment!

326
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:33,924
Let me see!

327
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:51,648
What happened?

328
00:41:04,995 --> 00:41:05,962
Have this!

329
00:41:07,064 --> 00:41:10,556
I took so much pains to make it and
you don't even want to try?

330
00:41:11,001 --> 00:41:12,969
Okay, you feed me!

331
00:41:15,005 --> 00:41:17,098
- One more.
- How much more will you feed me?

332
00:41:17,708 --> 00:41:19,300
As much as I feel like!

333
00:41:23,747 --> 00:41:25,442
I'll leave for office now.

334
00:41:27,751 --> 00:41:31,209
- Hey! Where is my briefcase?
- I'll get it in a moment!

335
00:41:33,023 --> 00:41:33,990
Please listen.

336
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:40,392
- What is your order, my princess?
- Rubbish!

337
00:41:41,031 --> 00:41:43,158
You were leaving without meeting me?

338
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:47,729
You have put me in this room like a
handicapped person and to top it...

339
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:50,800
Hey! Don't talk like this.

340
00:41:51,742 --> 00:41:55,007
Whatever I am doing,
is for your own good!

341
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:59,009
- Okay, I'll go now.
- Listen...

342
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:03,315
- have you changed your menu too?
- What does that mean?

343
00:42:05,055 --> 00:42:08,718
You used to have a sweet dish
before leaving.

344
00:42:09,126 --> 00:42:11,151
Oh, I forgot!

345
00:42:25,075 --> 00:42:26,337
Okay, I am going.

346
00:42:27,478 --> 00:42:30,811
Here is your bag and come back
early in the evening.

347
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:33,843
Because of you, we cannot
sleep at proper hours.

348
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:38,211
I will surely abide to my
sister in law's commands!

349
00:42:57,107 --> 00:43:00,634
- Where are you going?
- I'll serve food to brother in law.

350
00:43:02,012 --> 00:43:05,311
He must have eaten,
you don't bother, go to sleep.

351
00:43:29,206 --> 00:43:33,233
So how does it feel
in cold water?

352
00:44:17,955 --> 00:44:20,446
Indu, please give me water.

353
00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:12,208
- What happened, child?
- It broke!

354
00:45:13,243 --> 00:45:16,212
Never mind, I'll get water for you!

355
00:45:19,016 --> 00:45:22,383
Sister, what are you doing
here at this hour?

356
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:26,856
There was no water and
neither were you around!

357
00:45:27,257 --> 00:45:31,853
I had gone to give him coffee.
You should have called out to me.

358
00:45:32,262 --> 00:45:35,231
What are you doing here? Have you
forgotten what the doctor said?

359
00:45:36,366 --> 00:45:38,231
Come on, go inside!

360
00:45:41,271 --> 00:45:44,240
I'll get a bell fixed
at your bedside...

361
00:45:44,608 --> 00:45:46,576
so that other's don't have to
go through any trouble.

362
00:45:48,278 --> 00:45:50,246
The trouble has already started!

363
00:45:51,181 --> 00:45:55,242
Darling, the result of this trouble
will be worthwhile!

364
00:45:56,286 --> 00:45:57,583
Go and rest now.

365
00:46:25,215 --> 00:46:26,273
Aunty!

366
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:42,292
- What did she say?
- Sister has delivered a baby girl!

367
00:46:44,067 --> 00:46:46,592
- The first one should've been a boy.
- What can we do now?

368
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:50,631
Let's go home, she'll be in the
post-operation room for 24 hours.

369
00:46:51,008 --> 00:46:52,976
Okay, let's go home and rest.

370
00:46:53,343 --> 00:46:56,312
You both look very tired!

371
00:46:57,281 --> 00:47:01,012
- Even I shouldn't be staying here.
- We'll drop you on the way.

372
00:47:01,351 --> 00:47:03,319
- All right.
- Let's go!

373
00:47:15,365 --> 00:47:17,333
Where are you going?

374
00:47:18,869 --> 00:47:21,667
- To sleep!
- Won't you feel scared...

375
00:47:22,105 --> 00:47:23,902
to sleep alone today?

376
00:47:39,089 --> 00:47:41,148
You have got a daughter!

377
00:47:43,126 --> 00:47:45,754
- Where is my baby?
- Do you want to see her?

378
00:47:48,899 --> 00:47:50,867
Please call the baby's father too...

379
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:56,529
I'd like to see the gift
of our love together!

380
00:47:57,074 --> 00:48:00,373
The baby's father is not here,
they have left long back!

381
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:12,715
Who is it?

382
00:48:18,428 --> 00:48:21,522
I was scared alone!

383
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:33,075
I told you! Come, now you
will not feel scared!

384
00:48:59,202 --> 00:49:02,603
Why do you need to sweep
the house early in the morning?

385
00:49:02,973 --> 00:49:04,770
All the dirt stays back!

386
00:49:05,142 --> 00:49:09,442
You are an outsider, you don't know,
I've been doing this since years.

387
00:49:09,813 --> 00:49:13,078
Goddess Laxmi visits a clean house!

388
00:49:13,483 --> 00:49:17,442
It was different then, now
you'll have to do as I say!

389
00:49:17,821 --> 00:49:21,450
From tomorrow, you will sweep only
after 8 a.m., did you get that?

390
00:49:37,507 --> 00:49:39,270
Come out carefully.

391
00:49:40,577 --> 00:49:43,478
We'll name her Pooja.

392
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:49,218
- How are you?
- May no evil eye cast...

393
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:52,147
upon the mother and the child!
You've got a new birth...

394
00:49:52,522 --> 00:49:55,150
may you always be happy!

395
00:49:58,595 --> 00:50:03,089
Pooja, this is your home,
isn't it nice?

396
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:06,165
Where is Indu?

397
00:50:06,603 --> 00:50:09,299
She's not feeling well.
I think she is sleeping upstairs.

398
00:50:22,552 --> 00:50:26,010
My dear child will sleep now!

399
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:37,527
Child, can I say something
if you don't mind?

400
00:50:38,568 --> 00:50:41,332
- Please tell me!
- By God's grace...

401
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:47,143
everything has went off well. You
have come back home with a baby...

402
00:50:47,577 --> 00:50:52,776
your aunt did a favour by sending
her daughter to take care of you.

403
00:50:53,583 --> 00:50:58,350
Child, now you send
your sister back to her house.

404
00:50:59,656 --> 00:51:03,217
- What is the matter, aunt?
- What can I say?

405
00:51:04,594 --> 00:51:10,123
I have grayed with experience.
The elders have not made a mistake...

406
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:16,698
if they've said that a man and
a woman are like the fuel and fire!

407
00:51:17,808 --> 00:51:21,710
Child, in short, I've
explained a lot to you.

408
00:51:22,779 --> 00:51:25,304
I'll go and get you a glass of milk.

409
00:51:36,626 --> 00:51:40,255
Hey! What is this?
Why are you silent?

410
00:51:42,632 --> 00:51:45,396
Don't ask me, ask your wife!

411
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:50,933
Wait here!

412
00:51:59,649 --> 00:52:01,947
Have you asked Indu to leave?

413
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:04,948
Yes.

414
00:52:06,656 --> 00:52:07,953
Why?

415
00:52:08,859 --> 00:52:11,623
After all, how long can
an outsider live here?

416
00:52:12,395 --> 00:52:14,829
Besides, what will her mother think?

417
00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:22,964
Nisha, Indu is your sister...

418
00:52:23,373 --> 00:52:27,002
then how is she an outsider? And
your aunt is very magnanimous!

419
00:52:27,410 --> 00:52:29,435
She is very concerned
about your welfare!

420
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:33,646
If she could leave Indu here for so
long then why not for sometime more?

421
00:52:34,584 --> 00:52:36,984
Besides darling, you need to rest!

422
00:52:39,422 --> 00:52:41,913
That is why, you don't
get tensed unnecessarily!

423
00:52:57,707 --> 00:53:00,005
Hey! Is the stuff genuine?
- Of course!

424
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:03,178
Then I'm sure
the water is adulterated.

425
00:53:06,483 --> 00:53:10,010
Came alone? Where is your wife?
- She's not well.

426
00:53:12,622 --> 00:53:16,490
Mr. Kabir likes to have
women at his side!

427
00:53:21,731 --> 00:53:24,700
- Just a minute, chief!
- I'll be back in a minute.

428
00:53:27,804 --> 00:53:32,264
Listen, it's my duty to say
whether you listen to me or not!

429
00:53:32,742 --> 00:53:38,510
You may spend your time
with any woman you please...

430
00:53:38,915 --> 00:53:43,045
but when you step out of the house,
your wife should be on your side...

431
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:46,719
if you do that, people look upon
you and respect you, understand?

432
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:07,502
These 10 months have
passed like 10 years.

433
00:54:07,877 --> 00:54:09,868
You are right child,
well actually...

434
00:54:15,785 --> 00:54:19,084
Today our dear baby
will sleep in her room!

435
00:55:08,238 --> 00:55:11,799
Sister, what are you doing?
- Throwing the dirt out of my room!

436
00:55:12,175 --> 00:55:14,143
What condition have you
kept this room...

437
00:55:19,849 --> 00:55:25,151
You wore this shawl? How dare you?

438
00:55:28,525 --> 00:55:35,829
You very well know that
my life is in this shawl!

439
00:55:36,866 --> 00:55:39,835
Yet, how could you touch it?

440
00:55:41,871 --> 00:55:45,637
You leave this place,
this is my house!!

441
00:55:46,876 --> 00:55:51,904
No, Nisha! Aunty, you take
the baby downstairs!

442
00:55:53,983 --> 00:55:58,181
Nisha, if you scream,
you will fall sick!

443
00:55:59,556 --> 00:56:04,118
These broken frames & clothes strewn
around, why is this room in a mess?

444
00:56:04,494 --> 00:56:06,655
I should be asking you
this question!

445
00:56:07,163 --> 00:56:11,463
Under the pretext of my sickness,
you have come this far?

446
00:56:11,901 --> 00:56:15,860
- I had never thought of this!
- You shouldn't ever think!

447
00:56:16,306 --> 00:56:22,575
You just need to rest,
go and rest in your room, go!

448
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:32,086
This room belongs to me, this
house belongs to me so do you!

449
00:56:32,989 --> 00:56:37,119
Enough of all this!
Remember one thing...

450
00:56:37,927 --> 00:56:41,886
nothing in this house
belongs to you!

451
00:56:43,032 --> 00:56:45,330
Whatever that's here,
is given by me!

452
00:56:46,936 --> 00:56:52,704
And I can give anything that belongs
to me to whomever I feel like!

453
00:56:55,945 --> 00:56:58,539
Here, wear this in front of her!

454
00:56:58,948 --> 00:57:02,577
Only then, will she stop
living in illusions!

455
00:57:06,656 --> 00:57:10,319
So, how does your sister
look in this shawl?

456
00:57:20,970 --> 00:57:23,939
Go and sleep in your room!

457
00:57:25,975 --> 00:57:30,275
- Darling, where are you going?
- To sleep downstairs!

458
00:57:31,681 --> 00:57:34,172
What is the point in
putting up an act now?

459
00:57:34,984 --> 00:57:39,580
When a person bares in front of
anyone then he has no shame left!

460
00:57:39,989 --> 00:57:42,958
Besides, Nisha is
a very understanding woman.

461
00:58:13,590 --> 00:58:17,117
Child, you should not lose hopes.

462
00:58:18,027 --> 00:58:22,293
I've heard and seen everything,
I had already cautioned you...

463
00:58:23,032 --> 00:58:26,661
have faith in God,
everything will be fine!

464
00:58:28,938 --> 00:58:34,308
No aunty, I will not be able to
breathe in this house!

465
00:58:36,045 --> 00:58:39,208
There is poison in the air!

466
00:58:40,583 --> 00:58:44,644
Think before you act, your life
doesn't only belong to you...

467
00:58:45,054 --> 00:58:50,185
it belongs to her too. You're just
not a wife, you are a mother too!

468
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:58,594
If you have to consume poison for
her sake then you must do it!

469
00:58:59,068 --> 00:59:04,370
- But aunty...
- Child, kill the wife within you.

470
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:08,041
And learn to live like a mother
in this house!

471
00:59:22,091 --> 00:59:25,390
- Where is Nisha?
- I think she is in her room.

472
00:59:25,828 --> 00:59:29,628
I've invited few guests
for dinner in a hotel.

473
00:59:30,466 --> 00:59:34,232
All of them are coming with their
spouses, her presence is required.

474
00:59:35,104 --> 00:59:38,198
Convey this to her
and you also come there!

475
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:49,708
Whenever you publish a new novel,
send me one copy of it!

476
00:59:50,119 --> 00:59:52,087
She is very fond of your novels.

477
00:59:53,222 --> 00:59:57,886
Mr. Kabir, our board of directors
have taken the decision that...

478
00:59:58,261 --> 01:00:00,422
the paper agency should be given
to you for this state!

479
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:15,100
Come Nisha, meet them,
they are Mr. & Mrs. Pratik...

480
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:19,243
she is Nisha, my wife!

481
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:22,278
Oh, we thought that
Indu was your wife!

482
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:31,119
Nisha wait, where are you going?

483
01:00:35,164 --> 01:00:37,257
I think she's not well!

484
01:00:37,867 --> 01:00:40,131
Since the time she has delivered,
she's not keeping well...

485
01:00:40,503 --> 01:00:43,939
you know, the post
delivery problems!

486
01:00:44,307 --> 01:00:49,142
Whatever the problem may be,
Mrs. Kabir's behavior was not right!

487
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:52,643
You'll please have a drink.

488
01:00:55,184 --> 01:00:57,812
We have lost the mood to
drink or have dinner.

489
01:00:58,187 --> 01:01:01,156
It would be better if you go home
and take care of your wife!

490
01:01:14,203 --> 01:01:17,172
Everyone was asking about you...

491
01:01:18,074 --> 01:01:21,840
why did you leave immediately,
why don't you speak?

492
01:01:23,046 --> 01:01:25,571
Didn't you feel ashamed
to behave like a child?

493
01:01:26,015 --> 01:01:32,181
I feel ashamed when someone calls
me sister in law or Mrs. Kabir!

494
01:01:33,089 --> 01:01:40,188
- Oh! So you've learnt to talk?
- I've been silent for too long!

495
01:01:41,230 --> 01:01:44,688
And this silence is killing me!

496
01:01:47,970 --> 01:01:49,870
I cannot bear it anymore.

497
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:57,407
I cannot bear to see my husband
being snatched away from me!

498
01:01:57,747 --> 01:02:01,410
Who is snatching
your husband away from you?

499
01:02:01,984 --> 01:02:05,647
You are Mrs. Kabir even today and
people look at you with respect.

500
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:08,357
Can anyone else get this respect?

501
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:16,823
Marital status doesn't only mean
a husband's home and his gifts...

502
01:02:17,266 --> 01:02:24,570
it means a bond of love
the husband and wife share...

503
01:02:24,941 --> 01:02:30,243
and the faith they share,
these are very fragile things!

504
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:35,842
It's my fault that I married a girl
from a lower middle class family!

505
01:02:36,285 --> 01:02:40,244
As Mrs. Kabir you've given speech,
you think you can lecture me too?

506
01:02:41,991 --> 01:02:46,894
Remember one thing, the popularity,
the respect that you've received...

507
01:02:47,296 --> 01:02:51,596
is not because, you are
educated, talented and capable...

508
01:02:51,968 --> 01:02:54,664
you are getting it because,
you are known as Mrs. Kabir!

509
01:02:57,039 --> 01:02:59,599
Besides, what do you lack?

510
01:03:00,309 --> 01:03:03,506
You have the freedom to live your
own life in and outside the house...

511
01:03:03,913 --> 01:03:06,006
a beautiful and
colorful lifestyle...

512
01:03:06,415 --> 01:03:08,610
I've given you love,
attention and caring...

513
01:03:08,985 --> 01:03:10,748
was that all a fake?

514
01:03:11,387 --> 01:03:15,687
I am hurt because,
all that was real!

515
01:03:17,260 --> 01:03:21,458
And I am living only because of
those beautiful memories!

516
01:03:23,866 --> 01:03:28,303
Kabir, a man's love is
like a mountain spring...

517
01:03:29,071 --> 01:03:31,505
which ends when flows
from the mountain top.

518
01:03:32,441 --> 01:03:34,966
But a woman's love
is like a river...

519
01:03:35,344 --> 01:03:38,575
- which keeps flowing forever!
- You have become insane!

520
01:03:39,048 --> 01:03:44,577
And the answer for your sonnet is
that however I may be...

521
01:03:45,021 --> 01:03:47,114
you will have to accept me this way!

522
01:03:48,357 --> 01:03:53,818
Listen for the last time, you live
peacefully & let us live peacefully!

523
01:04:43,746 --> 01:04:44,713
Listen...

524
01:04:48,417 --> 01:04:50,180
I want to tell you something.

525
01:04:55,524 --> 01:04:57,389
It won't take long.

526
01:05:01,030 --> 01:05:01,997
Tell me.

527
01:05:02,431 --> 01:05:06,959
I want to know
my position in your life!

528
01:05:08,170 --> 01:05:11,196
There is no point in repeating
the same things every now and then!

529
01:05:12,441 --> 01:05:14,409
We've spoken about this last night!

530
01:05:15,177 --> 01:05:17,737
And yet if you'd like to know
then listen...

531
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:20,148
you are my wife!

532
01:05:21,317 --> 01:05:23,410
Wife? And who is she?

533
01:05:27,857 --> 01:05:30,485
She is a very beautiful,
smart and cultured girl.

534
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:34,088
She exactly knows
how to keep a man happy!

535
01:05:35,464 --> 01:05:41,562
All right then you make
a choice between both of us!

536
01:05:42,138 --> 01:05:44,106
Nisha, what's wrong with you?

537
01:05:45,474 --> 01:05:48,238
I am tired!

538
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:53,772
A woman who has been proclaimed
insane in her house and...

539
01:05:54,984 --> 01:06:00,980
outside she's called Ms. Kabir! I'm
fed up of living this two faced life!

540
01:06:01,991 --> 01:06:03,652
Then what do you want?

541
01:06:06,495 --> 01:06:11,762
Just tell me who I am
amongst these two personalities?

542
01:06:17,073 --> 01:06:20,201
Kabir, I want to know your decision!

543
01:06:22,511 --> 01:06:24,274
So you want my decision?

544
01:06:25,214 --> 01:06:29,275
Very well then, soon you'll
know my decision in the court!

545
01:06:30,519 --> 01:06:34,011
Court?! No, Kabir!

546
01:06:35,324 --> 01:06:39,488
Do you know that divorce becomes
easier if the wife is insane?

547
01:06:40,529 --> 01:06:42,929
Wait, Kabir!

548
01:06:44,967 --> 01:06:50,098
Don't go to the court, the strongest
verdict is announced by one's mind!

549
01:06:50,539 --> 01:06:54,498
And you've already
announced your verdict!

550
01:06:57,279 --> 01:07:02,307
If you go to the court and
if some people malign me...

551
01:07:03,552 --> 01:07:06,680
then a few may even accuse you!

552
01:07:08,457 --> 01:07:10,186
And I'll not be able to bear this.

553
01:07:13,362 --> 01:07:18,197
That is why, here,
at this very moment...

554
01:07:20,569 --> 01:07:22,332
I set you free!

555
01:07:41,590 --> 01:07:43,057
What are you doing?

556
01:07:43,592 --> 01:07:46,060
There is no need to touch
the baby's belongings!

557
01:07:50,332 --> 01:07:53,096
Please Kabir, without her, I will...

558
01:07:53,602 --> 01:07:56,127
She has a house and
a respectable father...

559
01:07:56,672 --> 01:08:00,369
she is not an orphan like you
who will wander around!

560
01:08:00,743 --> 01:08:07,080
I plead to you, I have
no one else besides her!

561
01:08:07,550 --> 01:08:11,077
She will live in her house,
understand?

562
01:08:48,924 --> 01:08:51,950
She will not go anywhere,
she will live here!

563
01:08:53,162 --> 01:08:56,188
She has a home and
a respectable father!

564
01:08:56,665 --> 01:09:00,761
She is not an orphan like you
who will wander around!

565
01:09:39,708 --> 01:09:46,272
My child, I did not have
parents or any siblings...

566
01:09:48,284 --> 01:09:50,878
I did not have a family of my own...

567
01:09:53,722 --> 01:09:57,214
but when I got you I thought that...

568
01:09:58,727 --> 01:10:00,695
I had conquered the whole world!

569
01:10:04,533 --> 01:10:08,697
You bestowed me with the
highest honor by making me a mother!

570
01:10:11,607 --> 01:10:17,705
But your unfortunate mother
cannot give you her love!

571
01:10:19,782 --> 01:10:25,721
I feel that I won't be able to
repay your favor in this birth!

572
01:10:27,690 --> 01:10:33,720
But my child, wherever I may be,
I'll pray that...

573
01:10:35,631 --> 01:10:37,724
my daughter should...

574
01:10:39,468 --> 01:10:46,738
not encounter any problems, if
there is a problem in your life...

575
01:10:47,643 --> 01:10:50,874
then let it come in my share!

576
01:11:02,524 --> 01:11:03,752
My child...

577
01:11:06,795 --> 01:11:08,558
may you always be happy!

578
01:11:10,733 --> 01:11:12,098
Please forgive me!

579
01:12:04,753 --> 01:12:06,482
Let her go if she wants!

580
01:12:06,855 --> 01:12:11,087
- But where are you going?
- Aunty!!

581
01:12:11,727 --> 01:12:13,422
What stains are these?

582
01:12:14,997 --> 01:12:17,158
These are the
Goddess's blood stains!

583
01:12:17,533 --> 01:12:23,165
One day, the Goddess of this house
entered with these similar marks.

584
01:12:23,605 --> 01:12:27,598
And today, she has exited from here,
leaving behind her blood stains!

585
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:29,602
Here, take these keys, I'm leaving!

586
01:12:31,013 --> 01:12:36,417
- Aunty, where are you going?
- How are you concerned?

587
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:40,179
I cannot live in this hell
even for a minute!

588
01:12:40,889 --> 01:12:44,450
O God, I've never cursed anyone...

589
01:12:44,893 --> 01:12:49,193
but today I am saying that
the one who has hurt my madam...

590
01:12:49,631 --> 01:12:51,997
God will surely teach
a lesson to that person!

591
01:12:56,038 --> 01:12:58,871
The baby is crying,
go and handle her!

592
01:13:07,116 --> 01:13:11,678
It was my mistake that I married
a lower middle class girl like you!

593
01:13:13,922 --> 01:13:19,883
Your greatest ability is that
you are known as Mrs. Kabir!

594
01:13:20,629 --> 01:13:24,895
No, I am not Mrs. Kabir Suri!

595
01:13:25,834 --> 01:13:28,462
I am Nisha Sharma!

596
01:13:29,638 --> 01:13:32,698
I yet have the strength
to fight life!

597
01:13:33,675 --> 01:13:38,578
I will fight and move ahead
without the help of any support...

598
01:13:39,148 --> 01:13:41,912
at least, I will make an effort!

599
01:13:44,953 --> 01:13:47,922
From here, my fate took a turn!

600
01:13:48,657 --> 01:13:51,319
The women's home that was
inaugurated by me...

601
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:53,928
and people had cheered me...

602
01:13:54,696 --> 01:13:56,721
I had to seek refuge
in that same institution!

603
01:13:57,766 --> 01:14:00,929
And once again, I was
known as Nisha Sharma!

604
01:14:07,709 --> 01:14:10,940
Then began my encounter
with struggles...

605
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:15,639
a search for a job but
I could not get a job easily...

606
01:14:16,118 --> 01:14:20,350
because, I had the stigma of a
rejected woman attached to my name.

607
01:14:20,989 --> 01:14:23,514
And my biggest fault was...

608
01:14:23,992 --> 01:14:26,961
that I was abandoned by a man!

609
01:14:31,567 --> 01:14:34,434
Somehow, I managed to get one job.

610
01:14:37,272 --> 01:14:42,471
But there too, an evil man tried
to molest me by saying...

611
01:14:43,011 --> 01:14:49,473
that an abandoned woman has no self
respect that she'd want to restore!

612
01:14:50,486 --> 01:14:54,320
And she just puts up an act
to keep her respect intact!

613
01:14:56,024 --> 01:14:57,457
An abandoned woman!

614
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:03,120
As if being rejected by one man,
she becomes a public property!

615
01:15:03,699 --> 01:15:10,730
But I had vowed to save my honor &
I would not compromise on anything!

616
01:15:11,907 --> 01:15:15,570
I would live with respect
and die with respect!

617
01:15:16,778 --> 01:15:21,010
I wanted to prove that
a woman has her own identity!

618
01:15:26,054 --> 01:15:29,490
I completely dedicated my mind and
body in the services of 'Aadhaar'.

619
01:15:30,225 --> 01:15:35,128
I planned to host a charity show
long with the residents of 'Aadhaar'.

620
01:16:07,629 --> 01:16:11,861
Alok, we will have to cover the
function organized by 'Aadhaar'.

621
01:16:12,334 --> 01:16:14,529
We have instructions from
the Directorate that...

622
01:16:14,903 --> 01:16:17,531
in the concluding year of the
'world women's decade'...

623
01:16:17,906 --> 01:16:20,067
we must try to focus
on such programs!

624
01:21:04,559 --> 01:21:08,461
Our audience has appreciated
your script and performance!

625
01:21:09,397 --> 01:21:12,025
Here is the fan mail and we are
receiving many phone calls too.

626
01:21:13,068 --> 01:21:14,035
Thank you!

627
01:21:14,402 --> 01:21:19,032
I've always tried to encourage new
talents wherever I was posted.

628
01:21:20,075 --> 01:21:26,378
Seeing your ability, I feel you can
also be an asset for this media!

629
01:21:27,482 --> 01:21:33,512
Your greatest ability is that
you are Mrs. Kabir Suri!

630
01:21:34,155 --> 01:21:35,713
What are you thinking?

631
01:21:37,759 --> 01:21:41,957
If you are interested then I can
try for you through proper channels.

632
01:21:43,498 --> 01:21:46,899
I will be very thankful to you
if this is possible!

633
01:21:47,335 --> 01:21:49,303
Of course this is possible!
Good day!

634
01:21:57,445 --> 01:22:00,539
Hello, I'm sure you've not
recognized me, I was sure of this!

635
01:22:00,949 --> 01:22:04,077
This is what India lacks!
- No, I've recognized you, but...

636
01:22:04,452 --> 01:22:09,116
you didn't give me a chance to say!
You are Mr. Alok, the cameraman!

637
01:22:10,458 --> 01:22:12,221
I never forget any face
if I see it once!

638
01:22:12,460 --> 01:22:14,758
That's very nice,
come let me drop you to the gate!

639
01:22:15,363 --> 01:22:19,026
Actually, when I saw you going in
the cabin, I was waiting for you.

640
01:22:19,467 --> 01:22:22,095
- Why, was it something important?
- No, not important.

641
01:22:23,171 --> 01:22:25,139
It's time for transmission,
this is where India lacks.

642
01:22:25,473 --> 01:22:26,997
I'll tell you some other time!

643
01:22:29,477 --> 01:22:34,005
Actually, I was trying to
congratulate you since a long time!

644
01:22:34,482 --> 01:22:36,450
- Congratulate?!
- Yes, for the program...

645
01:22:36,818 --> 01:22:40,948
you hosted on that day!
'She is tender, not weak...

646
01:22:41,489 --> 01:22:45,653
a woman's second name is strength! '
That's all for now, bye, see you!

647
01:23:18,259 --> 01:23:19,886
Listen, please wait!

648
01:23:21,029 --> 01:23:24,829
Please accept my best wishes!

649
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:29,500
I cannot say anything else besides
this, here is a rose for you!

650
01:23:30,305 --> 01:23:33,297
Thank you not only for
your wishes and this flower...

651
01:23:40,248 --> 01:23:43,183
This is what India lacks...

652
01:23:43,551 --> 01:23:46,179
Anyway, you are doing the
announcement for the first time...

653
01:23:46,554 --> 01:23:48,647
so do it with full confidence!

654
01:23:56,898 --> 01:24:00,698
You have heard
Dr. Harivanshrai Bachchan's poem...

655
01:24:01,269 --> 01:24:04,136
'neither are you sleeping
nor am I...

656
01:24:04,572 --> 01:24:07,541
but the darkness of the night
is enveloping us! '

657
01:24:12,047 --> 01:24:14,345
And when such restless
feelings are aroused...

658
01:24:14,749 --> 01:24:17,718
then what transpires, we shall
not tell you about it...

659
01:24:18,253 --> 01:24:20,881
that will be expressed in the song
which you are about to listen.

660
01:25:18,379 --> 01:25:21,871
Now is the time for the last
presentation of 'Mehfil-e-Mausiki'.

661
01:25:22,650 --> 01:25:28,384
Everyone knows red is considered
as the color of love in literature.

662
01:25:28,823 --> 01:25:34,284
But our poet has named love
in a thousand colored rainbow!

663
01:25:34,662 --> 01:25:36,289
So let's hear the sonnet.

664
01:25:36,664 --> 01:25:42,625
If you'd know it yourself, your
husband wouldn't have thrown you out!

665
01:25:55,817 --> 01:25:57,808
Mr. Kuwar would like
to speak to you.

666
01:25:58,386 --> 01:26:00,354
You have yet not replied
to the office memo.

667
01:26:00,688 --> 01:26:05,148
Do you know you can be dismissed
for spoiling such an important show?

668
01:26:05,693 --> 01:26:08,992
Your program is not more important
than any woman's honor!

669
01:26:09,397 --> 01:26:12,059
I don't care what
you think, Mr. Alok!

670
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:15,663
We're not concerned with that and if
you like to restore women's honor...

671
01:26:16,004 --> 01:26:17,801
then go and become a social worker!

672
01:26:18,173 --> 01:26:20,471
I not interested in working
in a place wherein...

673
01:26:20,842 --> 01:26:23,333
you put up an act of principles
on the screen...

674
01:26:23,711 --> 01:26:26,339
and behind the screen, those very
principles are stifled! Bye!

675
01:26:26,714 --> 01:26:30,480
Wait, Alok! Mr. Kuwar,
I'll see you later.

676
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:38,018
Come here, Alok. I am
nearing my retirement age...

677
01:26:38,726 --> 01:26:41,388
everything has changed
with time...

678
01:26:41,863 --> 01:26:44,696
I feel happy and also a sense of
remorse seeing things!

679
01:26:48,436 --> 01:26:51,030
Our values have been
changing very rapidly...

680
01:26:51,406 --> 01:26:53,203
I am not saying that change is bad.

681
01:26:53,541 --> 01:26:58,843
But the regret is the consequences
of these changes are very harsh!

682
01:27:00,949 --> 01:27:05,318
I'm glad to have someone like you
in my staff in such an environment!

683
01:27:05,753 --> 01:27:07,721
Very good, keep it up!

684
01:27:08,756 --> 01:27:12,055
Oh yes, information secretary,
Mr. Dayal is visiting tomorrow.

685
01:27:12,493 --> 01:27:14,723
I've hosted a dinner, there
will be some local VIP's too.

686
01:27:15,096 --> 01:27:17,530
I'd like you to take charge
of all the arrangements.

687
01:27:17,932 --> 01:27:20,400
Sir, you be rest assured,
your arrangements will be done!

688
01:27:24,939 --> 01:27:27,737
I was waiting for you.

689
01:27:28,109 --> 01:27:31,078
Wow! These days women wait for me?

690
01:27:31,479 --> 01:27:34,414
This is where India lacks! No
sorry, now it cannot lack anywhere!

691
01:27:34,782 --> 01:27:38,878
Stop joking! You unnecessarily got
into a fight because of me!

692
01:27:39,454 --> 01:27:41,422
I've heard that Mr. Kuwar
has given you a memo.

693
01:27:41,789 --> 01:27:45,384
We Governments officials don't call
it a memo, we call it a love letter!

694
01:27:45,793 --> 01:27:48,421
We receive it, we read and then
the chapter is closed!

695
01:27:48,863 --> 01:27:52,264
What is the point doing this,
how many people will you fight?

696
01:27:53,268 --> 01:27:57,762
In the past three years, I've grown
accustomed to hearing such barbs!

697
01:27:58,873 --> 01:28:01,535
I don't want that someone should
get into trouble because of me!

698
01:28:01,909 --> 01:28:05,436
And even I don't like that someone
can insult a woman in this manner!

699
01:28:05,980 --> 01:28:08,471
- But you...
- Don't say any further!

700
01:28:08,916 --> 01:28:12,579
Change your mood, Mr. Kumar said
that there is function tomorrow...

701
01:28:12,954 --> 01:28:16,788
at his place and you've to make
the arrangements, understand? Bye!

702
01:28:20,495 --> 01:28:21,792
Please come in!

703
01:28:27,835 --> 01:28:29,302
I know her very well.

704
01:28:33,574 --> 01:28:35,542
Nisha, you wait here
to welcome other guests.

705
01:28:58,199 --> 01:29:00,497
Hello sister, how are you?

706
01:29:13,381 --> 01:29:15,508
To make this a memorable evening...

707
01:29:15,883 --> 01:29:19,512
there are many known
artists present amidst us...

708
01:29:19,887 --> 01:29:24,517
but first, I'd like to call upon
Doordarshan's famous announcer...

709
01:29:24,892 --> 01:29:30,387
in fact, she is a multi channel
artist, Ms. Nisha Sharma.

710
01:29:32,333 --> 01:29:36,099
Ms. Nisha, please come here!

711
01:29:43,811 --> 01:29:45,574
Alok, without asking me you have...

712
01:29:45,913 --> 01:29:48,882
I didn't feel the need, you are
supposed to entertain the guests now!

713
01:29:52,120 --> 01:29:56,887
I'm not a singer but I'll surely
try to convey something in my song.

714
01:29:57,925 --> 01:30:02,419
Actually, it is quite difficult
to say something in the parties...

715
01:30:02,930 --> 01:30:06,798
because, one doesn't know who is
your friend or a foe! But yet...

716
01:34:32,299 --> 01:34:35,496
- There your mother is!
- Why did you get the baby here?

717
01:34:35,903 --> 01:34:38,963
Can't you see, there's no child here?
- She was crying a lot!

718
01:34:40,708 --> 01:34:42,801
Madam, she has fever!

719
01:34:43,210 --> 01:34:47,840
If she has fever, there is Metacin
in the car, give it to her.

720
01:34:48,215 --> 01:34:50,911
Take her, I'll come soon.

721
01:34:58,926 --> 01:35:02,191
This is what India lacks!
Few people applauded your song...

722
01:35:02,563 --> 01:35:04,997
and that has brought
tears to your eyes.

723
01:35:05,399 --> 01:35:08,800
But this is wrong!
That's all I wanted to tell you.

724
01:35:26,454 --> 01:35:31,221
- Why is the baby crying?
- She has high fever.

725
01:35:32,993 --> 01:35:35,860
- Is she Mr. Kabir's daughter?
- Yes, she is.

726
01:35:36,263 --> 01:35:40,029
But madam, the child would be
taken care if she had a mother.

727
01:35:48,008 --> 01:35:48,975
Child!

728
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:56,044
Please stop crying child,
you'll be all right!

729
01:35:58,285 --> 01:36:00,446
Child, tell me your name?

730
01:36:06,093 --> 01:36:09,961
- Do you go to school?
- Yes, she goes to St. Teresa's.

731
01:36:10,364 --> 01:36:14,562
- She is in the K.G. Class.
- My dear child!

732
01:36:16,003 --> 01:36:18,597
- Who are you?
- I?

733
01:36:22,009 --> 01:36:24,739
Child, I am your aunty!

734
01:36:26,447 --> 01:36:32,010
No, you are a very nice aunty.
Will you tell me a story?

735
01:36:33,120 --> 01:36:37,489
Yes, she will,
she knows a lot of stories!

736
01:36:38,325 --> 01:36:42,284
- Who is he?
- Child, he is uncle!

737
01:36:43,063 --> 01:36:46,624
This is where India lacks!
I am a very nice uncle!

738
01:36:47,001 --> 01:36:49,299
Even I know many stories,
will you listen to them?

739
01:36:50,337 --> 01:36:54,637
I'll tell you someday.
Nisha, why have you come here?

740
01:36:55,075 --> 01:36:59,444
Mr. Kumar was asking for you, a lot
of work has to be dome, let's go!

741
01:37:00,047 --> 01:37:01,105
I'll just come.

742
01:37:17,364 --> 01:37:19,662
Child, don't ever cry!

743
01:37:51,131 --> 01:37:53,656
- Where is Nisha?
- She left!

744
01:37:54,101 --> 01:37:56,035
- What are you doing?
- Collecting the papers...

745
01:37:56,403 --> 01:37:59,372
- she writes and throws!
- She has written on them?

746
01:38:03,577 --> 01:38:08,480
'Darkness is guided by million stars
and disappointment with hope! '

747
01:38:20,127 --> 01:38:22,391
My daughter will turn
4 years old tomorrow.

748
01:38:25,232 --> 01:38:26,995
May you live long, my child!

749
01:38:36,577 --> 01:38:40,104
- Come in!
- No, I came here to congratulate you

750
01:38:40,581 --> 01:38:45,075
lf, you have written this!

751
01:38:46,453 --> 01:38:49,422
Where did you find it?

752
01:38:49,924 --> 01:38:53,416
You should not throw away
such priceless gems!

753
01:38:54,461 --> 01:38:56,429
- I found this...
- Okay, please come in!

754
01:38:56,797 --> 01:38:59,061
No, some other time,
actually I was...

755
01:38:59,466 --> 01:39:03,061
This is not right, you've come for
the first time, I can't let you go!

756
01:39:03,470 --> 01:39:04,664
Please come in.

757
01:39:09,677 --> 01:39:10,666
Please sit.

758
01:39:13,480 --> 01:39:15,948
- How do you find my house?
- Very beautiful!

759
01:39:17,484 --> 01:39:21,580
It's very simple, not heavily
decorated and practical.

760
01:39:23,557 --> 01:39:28,654
You write very well, if you don't
mind, can I give you a suggestion?

761
01:39:29,129 --> 01:39:32,860
- Sure, please tell me.
- You change your name.

762
01:39:35,035 --> 01:39:37,799
Why do you joke all the while,
do you ever talk seriously?

763
01:39:38,372 --> 01:39:41,808
This is what India lacks! People
think I'm joking when I'm serious!

764
01:39:42,209 --> 01:39:45,975
- Alok, that now what I meant!
- Even I was not joking!

765
01:39:46,714 --> 01:39:51,742
In simple words I would like
to say that your poems...

766
01:39:52,219 --> 01:39:56,087
have the inspiration and
courage to fight life...

767
01:39:56,523 --> 01:39:59,492
you should start calling
yourself Asha (hope) now!

768
01:40:00,594 --> 01:40:04,587
Whether you listen to this or not,
you'll have to listen to one thing!

769
01:40:05,199 --> 01:40:06,063
What?

770
01:40:06,333 --> 01:40:08,824
You will have to make for me
a hot cup of tea!

771
01:40:09,336 --> 01:40:11,167
I'll just get it!

772
01:40:34,962 --> 01:40:37,192
You must've got bored alone,
here is your tea!

773
01:40:37,564 --> 01:40:38,724
Not at all.

774
01:40:40,567 --> 01:40:45,766
These walls make me feel very
comfortable, it feels like a home!

775
01:40:47,474 --> 01:40:50,534
A home is just not made with walls!

776
01:40:53,180 --> 01:40:58,277
True! And the truth is
that this tea is excellent!

777
01:40:59,119 --> 01:41:01,280
And I am not joking,
I am saying the truth!

778
01:41:10,998 --> 01:41:15,833
Take him to baby Pooja Suri
in K.G. Class.

779
01:41:28,615 --> 01:41:30,583
Baby, that uncle
has come to meet you.

780
01:41:34,955 --> 01:41:37,355
Oh! He is my nice uncle!

781
01:41:41,361 --> 01:41:43,329
- Hasn't aunty come along?
- No...

782
01:41:43,764 --> 01:41:46,892
but she's sent many gifts for you!

783
01:41:47,634 --> 01:41:50,933
- Lot's of them?
- Yes, this is a sweet kiss.

784
01:41:51,338 --> 01:41:54,034
Here, is one more
and wait a minute...

785
01:41:59,213 --> 01:42:01,272
these are sweets for your class...

786
01:42:01,782 --> 01:42:05,616
and this is a sweet little doll
for a doll like you!

787
01:42:06,153 --> 01:42:08,280
Aunty has also wished you
happy birthday!

788
01:42:15,028 --> 01:42:17,622
Uncle, is it my birthday today?

789
01:42:18,565 --> 01:42:20,692
- Yes, child.
- Really?

790
01:42:22,369 --> 01:42:24,303
Uncle, please turn your face.

791
01:42:24,805 --> 01:42:28,866
This is for you... and
this is for my nice aunty!

792
01:42:29,676 --> 01:42:34,636
Please give it to her or
I shall not speak to you, bye!

793
01:43:16,490 --> 01:43:20,017
- Where are you running?
- Well, I was...

794
01:43:20,727 --> 01:43:22,888
- What brings you here?
- I had to meet.

795
01:43:25,732 --> 01:43:27,700
- Whom did you have to meet?
- A child!

796
01:43:28,635 --> 01:43:29,863
Whose child?

797
01:43:30,737 --> 01:43:33,706
My child, all right I am going!

798
01:43:35,742 --> 01:43:38,142
Alok, wait! What is the matter?

799
01:43:38,545 --> 01:43:40,945
Nothing!

800
01:43:41,748 --> 01:43:45,411
You never mentioned about a wife in
all these years and now this child?

801
01:43:45,752 --> 01:43:50,348
This where India lacks!
You are just assuming things!

802
01:43:50,757 --> 01:43:54,887
So what if I did not mention about
a wife, is it necessary?

803
01:44:12,479 --> 01:44:14,174
Come here, child.

804
01:44:15,949 --> 01:44:17,416
May you live long!

805
01:44:17,784 --> 01:44:23,745
Aunty, thanks for sending sweets
for my class and this doll for me!

806
01:44:25,259 --> 01:44:28,387
- I sent it?!
- Yes, through uncle!

807
01:44:28,795 --> 01:44:32,424
Aunty, how did you know
that today is my birthday?

808
01:44:35,369 --> 01:44:36,358
My child!

809
01:44:39,706 --> 01:44:43,369
Aunty, you are so big
and yet you are crying?

810
01:44:44,678 --> 01:44:46,908
No child, I am not crying!

811
01:44:48,515 --> 01:44:51,780
This is your birthday gift.

812
01:44:52,486 --> 01:44:54,579
You already gave me one,
is the another one?

813
01:44:56,623 --> 01:44:58,488
This is from uncle!

814
01:44:59,026 --> 01:45:01,790
Okay aunty, tell him
thanks on my behalf.

815
01:45:09,036 --> 01:45:16,408
Aunty, I had sent a kiss for you,
did uncle give it to you?

816
01:45:16,910 --> 01:45:20,038
Yes, he gave me.
Now can I go, child?

817
01:45:20,480 --> 01:45:24,416
- Okay, when will you come again?
- Very soon!

818
01:45:55,382 --> 01:45:59,842
Nisha, you have honored me by
coming to my humble abode!

819
01:46:10,630 --> 01:46:12,860
I came to know from office
that your health...

820
01:46:14,901 --> 01:46:16,926
What could go wrong
with my health, I was...

821
01:46:18,905 --> 01:46:20,566
Why are you looking at me like this?

822
01:46:20,907 --> 01:46:26,641
I was trying to see how cleverly,
if need be, you hide your tears!

823
01:46:27,080 --> 01:46:30,277
- Tears, not at all!
- Alok, stop pretending!

824
01:46:30,684 --> 01:46:33,380
- I have seen everything!
- Well, Nisha...

825
01:46:33,787 --> 01:46:36,517
I want to know why you have
tears in your eyes?

826
01:46:36,923 --> 01:46:39,983
These tears well up with joy,
without even thinking twice!

827
01:46:40,360 --> 01:46:43,420
Next time, I will put up
a 'no entry' board!

828
01:46:43,797 --> 01:46:46,391
Well actually, today is
Pooja's birthday...

829
01:46:46,733 --> 01:46:48,997
it's a happy occasion,
that is the reason!

830
01:46:51,638 --> 01:46:53,401
Listen, Nisha...

831
01:46:53,874 --> 01:46:58,504
Don't call me! I am not interested
in being friendly with a person...

832
01:46:58,945 --> 01:47:02,574
who is a hypocrite! The man who
likes to impose favors on others...

833
01:47:02,949 --> 01:47:06,248
but thinks it's below his
dignity to ask for support!

834
01:47:06,653 --> 01:47:10,020
This is where India lacks!
You are upset again!

835
01:47:10,690 --> 01:47:13,124
- There is nothing that I...
- You are lying again!

836
01:47:13,493 --> 01:47:19,489
Alok, don't you feel stifled
leading this farcical life?

837
01:47:20,967 --> 01:47:24,198
You like to gather
everyone's sorrows...

838
01:47:24,671 --> 01:47:28,607
but you don't want to let anyone
come close to your sorrows!

839
01:47:28,975 --> 01:47:31,273
I would like to know
why do you do that?

840
01:47:31,645 --> 01:47:35,741
What do you think you are?
God, Almighty, Messiah?

841
01:47:39,553 --> 01:47:46,789
I am sorry, some day,
I will tell you everything.

842
01:47:47,060 --> 01:47:49,756
Why some other day, why not today?

843
01:47:51,131 --> 01:47:56,967
Alok, by talking,
the pain does not end...

844
01:47:58,004 --> 01:48:02,964
but when it reaches out
to other person...

845
01:48:04,778 --> 01:48:09,181
then it relieves you
and you feel relaxed!

846
01:48:10,016 --> 01:48:11,313
This is the truth!

847
01:48:20,193 --> 01:48:25,597
Nisha, today is an unfortunate day
when a mother, who raised her son...

848
01:48:26,032 --> 01:48:31,402
with hard work and dreamt that her
son would be a rich man some day...

849
01:48:33,206 --> 01:48:39,805
did not die a natural death!
It was hunger that killed her!

850
01:48:42,516 --> 01:48:44,347
A terminal disease killed her.

851
01:48:46,186 --> 01:48:49,019
And her useless son
could not do anything for her.

852
01:48:50,857 --> 01:48:56,420
After her death, everything
went off the way she wanted.

853
01:49:00,166 --> 01:49:02,691
Believe me...

854
01:49:05,138 --> 01:49:08,266
in everything I gained,
I felt a sense of loss...

855
01:49:09,309 --> 01:49:13,245
my victories felt like defeat...

856
01:49:17,083 --> 01:49:22,544
sometimes I think,
why do I have all this?

857
01:49:29,095 --> 01:49:36,866
Forgive me, inspite of wanting,
I could not be a part of your joy!

858
01:49:44,444 --> 01:49:47,811
Child, now go to sleep, if your
mother returns, she'll scold you!

859
01:49:48,181 --> 01:49:51,241
Do you know, today is my birthday!

860
01:49:51,685 --> 01:49:54,153
Uncle and aunty told me about it...

861
01:49:54,588 --> 01:49:58,080
even father does not remember,
I will tell him!

862
01:49:59,125 --> 01:50:03,653
What will you tell me?
Come here, child!

863
01:50:04,130 --> 01:50:09,966
- Look at this, father!
- Who got you that many toys?

864
01:50:10,403 --> 01:50:13,702
Who'll get it, someone must
have given it to her in school!

865
01:50:14,140 --> 01:50:17,701
No father, uncle and aunty
have given them.

866
01:50:18,144 --> 01:50:23,241
- Today is my birthday!
- Oh, is it so?

867
01:50:26,886 --> 01:50:32,847
Indu, I am busy with work but
you should have remembered!

868
01:50:33,293 --> 01:50:37,252
How many things can I remember? You
are her father and even you forgot!

869
01:50:39,599 --> 01:50:43,399
Mary, put her to sleep or she'll
harass us to go to school tomorrow.

870
01:50:45,872 --> 01:50:48,670
- Come, child!
- No, I'll sleep with father.

871
01:50:49,075 --> 01:50:50,872
All right, you sleep with me.

872
01:50:52,979 --> 01:50:55,470
My dear child will sleep
with me tonight!

873
01:50:56,016 --> 01:51:00,282
You sit here, I'll change and be
right back, you watch the television!

874
01:51:06,192 --> 01:51:07,159
Greetings!

875
01:51:08,595 --> 01:51:11,758
Father, she is my nice aunty!

876
01:51:12,198 --> 01:51:14,166
She's the one who gave me toys!

877
01:51:14,601 --> 01:51:18,833
After giving me the toys,
she started crying! My nice aunty!

878
01:51:21,608 --> 01:51:25,476
Father, she kissed me
and began to cry!

879
01:51:30,950 --> 01:51:36,752
You did not ask her why she was
crying? You should have asked!

880
01:51:37,223 --> 01:51:40,522
You have yet not slept,
you have to go to school tomorrow.

881
01:51:40,927 --> 01:51:42,758
Go to your room!

882
01:51:48,101 --> 01:51:50,831
Why did you scold her?
How is she to be blamed?

883
01:51:51,237 --> 01:51:57,540
Kabir, I don't like Nisha meeting
her on sly and giving her presents.

884
01:51:58,945 --> 01:52:01,880
I think she has planned
to do something!

885
01:52:03,249 --> 01:52:04,910
What can she do?

886
01:52:05,251 --> 01:52:08,220
She is her mother, she must be
getting the urge to see her daughter!

887
01:52:08,955 --> 01:52:11,549
Today she felt like meeting her
and she landed up in the school...

888
01:52:11,925 --> 01:52:15,884
tomorrow, she can come here too!
Kabir, if she loves her so much...

889
01:52:16,262 --> 01:52:19,789
then why did she leave
such a small child here?

890
01:52:28,675 --> 01:52:31,974
I think that the serials
are improving.

891
01:52:35,281 --> 01:52:38,045
- Nisha, someone is waiting for you.
- Where?

892
01:52:55,034 --> 01:52:56,661
Here are your things.

893
01:52:58,037 --> 01:52:59,265
My things?!

894
01:53:00,006 --> 01:53:03,874
The one you gave Pooja
on the pretext of her birthday.

895
01:53:06,446 --> 01:53:09,938
- But she had...
- Don't poison her mind...

896
01:53:10,316 --> 01:53:13,012
and instigate her against me!

897
01:53:16,055 --> 01:53:20,287
If you really loved her then you
wouldn't leave the infant back there.

898
01:53:21,327 --> 01:53:26,526
At that time perhaps, this glamour
and popularity was beckoning you!

899
01:53:29,335 --> 01:53:34,034
- Please, this is my office.
- I'm not interested in coming here!

900
01:53:34,808 --> 01:53:37,299
I did not know your address
and I had to meet you.

901
01:53:38,444 --> 01:53:43,006
I just want to tell you that Pooja
does not mean anything to you!

902
01:53:43,416 --> 01:53:45,384
Don't ever try to meet her again!

903
01:53:47,754 --> 01:53:51,884
But Indu, I'd like to
meet Pooja sometimes...

904
01:53:52,792 --> 01:53:54,726
First you'll meet her...

905
01:53:57,530 --> 01:53:59,327
and then, Kabir...

906
01:54:02,101 --> 01:54:06,037
and then that house,
isn't that what you've planned?

907
01:54:07,273 --> 01:54:12,905
No, Indu! I really
don't want anything.

908
01:54:15,515 --> 01:54:22,148
Just let me meet my daughter
once in a while...

909
01:54:58,892 --> 01:55:03,056
If you loved her so much then why
did you leave the infant behind?

910
01:55:04,197 --> 01:55:09,396
At that time perhaps, this glamour
and popularity was beckoning you?

911
01:55:11,137 --> 01:55:14,402
First it is Pooja... then Kabir...

912
01:55:16,442 --> 01:55:20,208
and then that house. Isn't
that what you have planned?

913
01:55:21,581 --> 01:55:27,417
Don't poison her mind and try
to instigate her against me!

914
01:55:49,642 --> 01:55:50,768
Coward!!

915
01:55:53,212 --> 01:55:58,980
Foolish woman! You were
trying to commit suicide?

916
01:56:18,504 --> 01:56:21,473
I am really very weak!

917
01:56:23,242 --> 01:56:28,270
I tried hard to be strong!

918
01:56:29,682 --> 01:56:33,482
I have tried hard to fight life!

919
01:56:34,687 --> 01:56:38,919
But I have lost, Alok!

920
01:56:43,529 --> 01:56:46,657
I cannot live
this hypocritical life!

921
01:56:47,767 --> 01:56:52,636
I have lost, I am very tired!

922
01:56:59,212 --> 01:57:00,304
Get up, Nisha!

923
01:57:04,050 --> 01:57:05,176
Get up!

924
01:57:12,458 --> 01:57:13,755
Come with me!

925
02:02:20,733 --> 02:02:23,827
After hearing this, I don't
think that you are so weak!

926
02:02:27,873 --> 02:02:30,842
I've come to this house
once before...

927
02:02:31,777 --> 02:02:34,507
to tell you that
you write very well.

928
02:02:35,548 --> 02:02:39,382
But today, I was
compelled to come here...

929
02:02:39,885 --> 02:02:44,117
to remind you that you are the same
person who used to write very well.

930
02:02:46,225 --> 02:02:49,854
Listen, you are not weak!

931
02:02:51,897 --> 02:02:54,866
I don't know much
about your past...

932
02:02:55,901 --> 02:02:57,869
and neither do I want to know!

933
02:02:59,405 --> 02:03:03,637
I would want you also to forget
about it thinking that...

934
02:03:04,143 --> 02:03:08,546
it was your last birth and now,
this moment...

935
02:03:08,914 --> 02:03:11,212
you've got a new birth!

936
02:03:11,984 --> 02:03:16,444
You don't have a right
over it, I have!

937
02:03:19,725 --> 02:03:24,526
No, please don't misunderstand me!
I am not asking you for anything!

938
02:03:27,633 --> 02:03:30,693
All I want is the strength
that is hidden within you...

939
02:03:31,070 --> 02:03:34,301
you should acknowledge that and
use it in the right direction...

940
02:03:34,707 --> 02:03:37,904
to bring about joy in the
hearts of millions like you!

941
02:03:41,947 --> 02:03:46,145
And this is your strength!
Yes, Nisha...

942
02:03:46,952 --> 02:03:49,216
your verses have the power!

943
02:03:53,692 --> 02:03:55,922
You have to promise me
one more thing.

944
02:03:56,962 --> 02:04:01,490
You will never feel weak
and give up on life!

945
02:04:03,669 --> 02:04:10,939
I am sure that tomorrow will bring
a new ray of hope in your life!

946
02:04:12,511 --> 02:04:16,277
Oh, it's 7 o'clock!
This is where India lacks!

947
02:04:16,715 --> 02:04:19,616
I've to cover the information and
broadcasting Minister's speech.

948
02:04:19,985 --> 02:04:22,613
If I don't do that,
I'll have to lose my job!

949
02:04:26,992 --> 02:04:30,052
Always keep smiling this way!

950
02:04:31,697 --> 02:04:33,289
Just like this!

951
02:05:28,787 --> 02:05:31,347
Oh! It's time for the transmission.

952
02:06:34,286 --> 02:06:36,254
It's a super hit,
created a sensation!!

953
02:06:37,289 --> 02:06:40,087
- Where are you?
- I am here, Alok!

954
02:06:42,828 --> 02:06:44,762
- May I come in?
- Sure!

955
02:06:47,166 --> 02:06:49,760
You have overwhelmed
everyone, Asha Shri!

956
02:06:50,135 --> 02:06:52,433
Listen to what Navbharat Times
has to say...

957
02:06:53,138 --> 02:06:56,767
'a fresh wave of air
in the world of literature'!

958
02:06:58,143 --> 02:07:02,443
Hear this, 'Patjhad, is a story
of a leaf fallen from a branch...

959
02:07:02,815 --> 02:07:04,783
which stirs the depths
of your heart! '

960
02:07:06,018 --> 02:07:08,714
And listen to Dr. Dharmveer
Bharati's comments.

961
02:07:09,154 --> 02:07:14,717
'The writer has words in form of
colors to express her thoughts and...

962
02:07:15,160 --> 02:07:17,594
That's enough!!

963
02:07:18,163 --> 02:07:23,465
This is what India lacks!
I wish I had your talent in me.

964
02:07:23,902 --> 02:07:30,137
I would love to listen to people
praising me all my life!

965
02:07:31,877 --> 02:07:36,837
The talent you posses, a lifetime
is insufficient to laud it!

966
02:07:37,282 --> 02:07:39,273
- Stop kidding!
- Alok...

967
02:07:39,718 --> 02:07:43,882
you posses the talent of humanity!
The art of sharing other's griefs.

968
02:07:44,256 --> 02:07:45,450
That's enough!

969
02:07:46,392 --> 02:07:51,694
I am sure your publishers
have given you this novel...

970
02:07:52,898 --> 02:07:55,492
- but this is a gift from me!
- Thank you!

971
02:08:04,410 --> 02:08:05,377
What is this?

972
02:08:05,611 --> 02:08:09,172
Isn't the face looking prettier
with the vermilion?

973
02:08:09,948 --> 02:08:11,506
It does look but...

974
02:08:12,217 --> 02:08:16,176
Give me this book.
Will you do me a favour?

975
02:08:17,523 --> 02:08:19,286
Turn towards the mirror.

976
02:08:22,361 --> 02:08:24,625
Now shut your eyes!

977
02:08:26,365 --> 02:08:28,333
Are you going to show me
a magical trick?

978
02:08:36,408 --> 02:08:38,000
Now, open your eyes!

979
02:08:42,915 --> 02:08:45,475
- What does this mean?
- Did I make a mistake?

980
02:08:46,251 --> 02:08:48,276
No, Alok!!

981
02:08:53,258 --> 02:08:56,625
- It's very late now!
- You don't think I'm worthy of you.

982
02:08:57,930 --> 02:09:01,366
Alok, I respect you immensely!

983
02:09:02,267 --> 02:09:05,361
Or perhaps, it is more than that!

984
02:09:06,805 --> 02:09:10,332
But now, I have nothing to offer...

985
02:09:11,276 --> 02:09:15,235
excepting an impassive
and an empty life!

986
02:09:16,682 --> 02:09:20,550
The autumn in my life
has come forever!

987
02:09:22,287 --> 02:09:28,590
I cannot talk like you but
I don't have a bad memory...

988
02:09:29,995 --> 02:09:36,059
you had written in your novel
that the seasons keep changing...

989
02:09:38,003 --> 02:09:41,268
there is spring after autumn!

990
02:09:42,307 --> 02:09:44,275
This is the truth, Nisha!

991
02:09:48,981 --> 02:09:50,812
And there is one more truth!

992
02:09:54,019 --> 02:09:56,510
I can wait for the season to change!

993
02:11:44,229 --> 02:11:48,029
- Whose letter is it?
- It's the solicitor's notice.

994
02:11:50,435 --> 02:11:55,065
To repay the bank loan
we'll have to sell our farms.

995
02:11:58,443 --> 02:12:01,412
- So this is the state we are in?
- Yes.

996
02:12:03,448 --> 02:12:08,750
Kabir, today I am remembering
Parvati aunty's words!

997
02:12:09,521 --> 02:12:16,757
She said while leaving, we really
are under a curse of a chaste woman!

998
02:12:18,463 --> 02:12:22,559
Yes Indu, at that time
I could not understand...

999
02:12:24,169 --> 02:12:26,103
but today I realize...

1000
02:12:27,606 --> 02:12:31,440
that when your happiness is
the cause of someone's grief...

1001
02:12:32,611 --> 02:12:34,579
it tends to become a great sin!

1002
02:12:47,492 --> 02:12:51,553
Has your fever subsided, child?
How are you feeling now?

1003
02:12:52,164 --> 02:12:53,256
I am fine!

1004
02:12:57,202 --> 02:13:01,798
Kabir smokes that many cigarettes,
why don't you stop him?

1005
02:13:02,240 --> 02:13:04,140
He'll harm his lungs with them!

1006
02:13:05,243 --> 02:13:08,269
We both have already
harmed ourselves, mother!

1007
02:13:10,115 --> 02:13:16,486
He immerses his sorrows
in cigarettes and alcohol...

1008
02:13:20,525 --> 02:13:22,493
but I can't even do that!

1009
02:13:23,228 --> 02:13:26,493
Why are you talking like that?
You have got whatever you wanted.

1010
02:13:28,233 --> 02:13:32,693
Yes, I wanted but
whatever I wanted...

1011
02:13:34,473 --> 02:13:39,172
I had no right to ask for it!

1012
02:13:41,213 --> 02:13:43,738
I was naive and stupid...

1013
02:13:45,250 --> 02:13:50,517
the glitter of wealth and
my youth had made me heady...

1014
02:13:52,024 --> 02:13:57,929
but you were matured,
you are a woman, a wife, a mother...

1015
02:14:00,565 --> 02:14:04,194
if you wanted, you could
have explained me that...

1016
02:14:06,271 --> 02:14:11,538
by snatching away a sister's husband
and a child from her mother...

1017
02:14:12,577 --> 02:14:16,946
I could never live happily!
Never!

1018
02:14:23,588 --> 02:14:25,954
When the flood water recedes...

1019
02:14:27,325 --> 02:14:31,557
it leaves behind filth and stench!

1020
02:14:33,765 --> 02:14:39,567
My life too is nothing else
but a heap of filth!

1021
02:14:42,340 --> 02:14:44,570
I feel I've stolen everything.

1022
02:14:46,611 --> 02:14:50,570
In the true sense,
neither could I be a wife...

1023
02:14:53,351 --> 02:14:55,080
nor a mother!

1024
02:14:55,620 --> 02:15:00,387
Frankly speaking, I've
started detesting myself!

1025
02:15:10,635 --> 02:15:15,595
Sir, the problem is that as per laws,
we can't sack our staff.

1026
02:15:16,341 --> 02:15:17,899
I know that!

1027
02:15:20,445 --> 02:15:24,211
Sir, we are getting back
the books from all the places.

1028
02:15:25,650 --> 02:15:32,613
People complain that our old writers
have no new thoughts to express.

1029
02:15:34,993 --> 02:15:37,291
Sir, have you read any
of Asha Shri's novels?

1030
02:15:37,796 --> 02:15:40,560
No, but I've heard
quite a lot about her.

1031
02:15:40,932 --> 02:15:44,800
You've heard it right!
She writes extremely well.

1032
02:15:46,371 --> 02:15:50,637
She pens down pain in such a way as
if she uses tears instead of ink!

1033
02:15:51,009 --> 02:15:54,445
All the publishers seem to be
approaching her these days.

1034
02:15:54,813 --> 02:15:57,646
Then what are you'll doing?

1035
02:15:58,316 --> 02:16:02,650
Sir, we did ask her for a book
but she refused to give it to us!

1036
02:16:04,089 --> 02:16:07,650
All right, I'll personally go
and request her.

1037
02:16:10,028 --> 02:16:11,655
Perhaps, she may agree.

1038
02:16:17,702 --> 02:16:19,670
Madam, someone has come to see you.

1039
02:16:30,182 --> 02:16:31,342
Send him in.

1040
02:16:42,727 --> 02:16:45,161
I have disturbed you without
a prior appointment.

1041
02:16:45,730 --> 02:16:47,698
Never mind, please sit!

1042
02:16:48,733 --> 02:16:49,927
Thank you very much.

1043
02:16:51,736 --> 02:16:55,399
- Well actually, I...
- You must have received my letter.

1044
02:16:55,807 --> 02:16:59,903
Yes, that's why I have personally
come here to request you.

1045
02:17:00,745 --> 02:17:05,011
Ms. Asha, it will be a honor
for us to publish your novel.

1046
02:17:05,517 --> 02:17:09,044
Because, your name tops the list
of popular and saleable writers.

1047
02:17:10,488 --> 02:17:13,389
Although, I, myself have not
read any of your novels.

1048
02:17:13,758 --> 02:17:17,194
But I've heard that
you pen down beautifully...

1049
02:17:17,562 --> 02:17:19,723
the sensitive moments of life!

1050
02:17:20,332 --> 02:17:22,232
Especially, pain!

1051
02:17:22,767 --> 02:17:25,463
- Pain!
- Yes, that's what I've heard!

1052
02:17:25,904 --> 02:17:29,340
You please be rest assured
about the royalty...

1053
02:17:29,774 --> 02:17:33,210
although my business condition is
not very favorable these days...

1054
02:17:33,578 --> 02:17:36,411
but I promise to give you
the royalty you ask for!

1055
02:17:36,781 --> 02:17:38,749
The full value of your work!

1056
02:17:39,784 --> 02:17:41,752
The value of work...

1057
02:17:42,787 --> 02:17:45,756
or the cash for a lifetime woe?

1058
02:17:47,792 --> 02:17:51,387
No, I am Asha Shri!

1059
02:17:52,664 --> 02:17:54,859
Nisha is dead long back, Mr. Kabir.

1060
02:17:56,801 --> 02:17:59,099
I had no idea that
you were Asha Shri.

1061
02:17:59,537 --> 02:18:02,028
Yes, I am Asha Shri!

1062
02:18:03,808 --> 02:18:09,303
Everything is different,
a new name, a new profession...

1063
02:18:11,016 --> 02:18:17,353
a new destination and none of these
have Mr. Kabir Suri's name on it!

1064
02:18:17,822 --> 02:18:23,021
Time has taught me a lesson,
don't embarrass me further, Nisha!

1065
02:18:24,763 --> 02:18:29,791
I have realized the potential of
your capabilities and you!

1066
02:18:30,735 --> 02:18:35,570
But it was too late. Whenever I
saw your program on the television...

1067
02:18:35,974 --> 02:18:43,346
I was forced to think where you had
hidden so much fire within you?

1068
02:18:44,049 --> 02:18:46,517
And now you write these books too!

1069
02:18:49,721 --> 02:18:53,088
Then, I was just a wife
and a mother...

1070
02:18:54,592 --> 02:18:58,824
the fire within me,
emitted out in form of love!

1071
02:19:01,566 --> 02:19:05,832
Anyway, forget about the past.
Let's talk something pleasant.

1072
02:19:07,872 --> 02:19:10,340
How is your wife?

1073
02:19:12,877 --> 02:19:19,248
You must be very happy because,
your wife is beautiful, smart...

1074
02:19:19,651 --> 02:19:25,988
cultured and also knows
the art of keeping a man happy!

1075
02:19:26,391 --> 02:19:30,851
Stop it Nisha, I cannot
hear it any further.

1076
02:19:33,898 --> 02:19:39,530
- How is Pooja?
- She has grown up now.

1077
02:19:40,905 --> 02:19:45,865
I was thinking of getting her
married once my business gets stable.

1078
02:19:47,712 --> 02:19:51,614
You have not seen her but
she looks exactly like you!

1079
02:19:52,650 --> 02:19:56,142
- She has the same eyes, the same...
- Stop it, Mr. Kabir.

1080
02:20:03,094 --> 02:20:07,963
For me she is yet this age!

1081
02:20:10,101 --> 02:20:12,899
She is always very close to me!

1082
02:20:14,939 --> 02:20:18,568
I speak with her
whenever I feel like.

1083
02:20:25,350 --> 02:20:30,982
Oh yes! You had taken the pains
of coming here for some work.

1084
02:20:32,657 --> 02:20:36,650
I will write a novel for you!

1085
02:20:37,695 --> 02:20:39,925
But you will have to
wait for sometime.

1086
02:20:41,065 --> 02:20:44,432
You've already spoken
about the royalty...

1087
02:20:45,670 --> 02:20:47,501
you'll give me whatever I demand.

1088
02:20:47,972 --> 02:20:50,941
All right, good bye!

1089
02:21:34,686 --> 02:21:35,653
You?!

1090
02:21:38,723 --> 02:21:43,990
Why did you take the trouble, you
should have called up, I'd come over!

1091
02:21:48,132 --> 02:21:50,999
Why are you standing?
Please sit down!

1092
02:21:53,037 --> 02:21:56,165
You've done a big favor
by coming here!

1093
02:21:57,075 --> 02:22:01,705
It is not a favour, Mr. Kabir,
I have enough decency in me...

1094
02:22:02,213 --> 02:22:06,274
that to repay the money,
I should come here!

1095
02:22:07,218 --> 02:22:09,015
After all, I am indebted!

1096
02:22:13,057 --> 02:22:14,354
Indebted?!

1097
02:22:14,792 --> 02:22:17,090
Don't think that
I am indebted to you!

1098
02:22:17,929 --> 02:22:22,366
I'm indebted to the child
who gave me the highest honor...

1099
02:22:22,734 --> 02:22:24,827
by making me a mother!

1100
02:22:25,937 --> 02:22:29,600
But in return, I could not
lavish my love on her!

1101
02:22:32,443 --> 02:22:37,642
This feeling has always
weighed on my conscience!

1102
02:22:39,150 --> 02:22:41,641
I'll never be able to
repay this debt...

1103
02:22:42,086 --> 02:22:45,055
but I may perhaps get the
satisfaction that I made an attempt!

1104
02:22:46,791 --> 02:22:49,726
I am sure that with
the sale of this novel...

1105
02:22:50,094 --> 02:22:56,055
my daughter will get
married as per your status!

1106
02:22:57,368 --> 02:22:58,392
Wait, Nisha!

1107
02:23:00,905 --> 02:23:04,068
Oh yes, I did not speak
about the royalty.

1108
02:23:04,809 --> 02:23:09,803
My royalty will be that
you will never tell Pooja...

1109
02:23:10,281 --> 02:23:15,082
that Asha Shri is her mother!

1110
02:23:16,120 --> 02:23:17,087
Good bye!

1111
02:23:18,122 --> 02:23:21,216
Wait Nisha, I want
to tell you something.

1112
02:23:24,862 --> 02:23:29,196
You have progressed
so much in life...

1113
02:23:30,134 --> 02:23:33,103
that inspite of wanting,
I cannot get you back!

1114
02:23:33,871 --> 02:23:35,634
I can only realize one thing...

1115
02:23:36,007 --> 02:23:39,374
that by losing you,
life taught me a tough lesson!

1116
02:23:41,145 --> 02:23:44,114
I was leading a life in darkness.

1117
02:23:44,849 --> 02:23:48,615
For me, marriage meant a wife...

1118
02:23:49,153 --> 02:23:52,452
who was a woman in the bed,
a caretaker at home...

1119
02:23:52,857 --> 02:23:55,382
and a pretty doll who was called
Mrs. So and so in the society!

1120
02:23:56,327 --> 02:24:01,128
Where a woman can be very simply
defined only in terms of her body!

1121
02:24:02,166 --> 02:24:05,658
But today...

1122
02:24:08,172 --> 02:24:10,367
when your individuality...

1123
02:24:11,175 --> 02:24:13,143
is known to the entire world...

1124
02:24:14,178 --> 02:24:17,545
I feel ashamed to even look at you!

1125
02:24:19,283 --> 02:24:22,946
Nisha, if possible,
please forgive me!

1126
02:24:24,389 --> 02:24:27,153
Please do me one more favor!

1127
02:24:28,259 --> 02:24:32,559
Please attend
your daughter's marriage.

1128
02:25:29,387 --> 02:25:33,448
The marriage rituals are over.
Now the bride shall leave the house.

1129
02:26:10,294 --> 02:26:12,387
Pooja has to leave.

1130
02:26:18,102 --> 02:26:24,268
Even I've strained my eyes waiting
for the one you've been looking for!

1131
02:26:31,816 --> 02:26:35,274
I wish sister would come here
for two minutes...

1132
02:26:36,187 --> 02:26:37,950
and bless Pooja!

1133
02:26:39,323 --> 02:26:45,558
Then I would feel that to some
extent, we've atoned for our sins.

1134
02:26:47,231 --> 02:26:52,567
Even I wished for the same but I
was also sure that she wouldn't come!

1135
02:26:54,338 --> 02:26:56,306
And she shouldn't even come here!

1136
02:26:59,343 --> 02:27:03,302
Indu, there are some sins
that can never be atoned.

1137
02:27:32,677 --> 02:27:35,407
May God always keep you happy!

1138
02:28:26,430 --> 02:28:28,398
My daughter got married...

1139
02:28:29,100 --> 02:28:30,897
and the story of my life ended!

1140
02:28:43,447 --> 02:28:48,544
- Hello!
- Alok, why are you standing there?

1141
02:28:50,454 --> 02:28:51,614
Come and sit.

1142
02:28:54,458 --> 02:28:56,221
- Did you read the novel?
- Yes...

1143
02:28:56,627 --> 02:28:59,221
I felt as though I'd seen the world.
And...

1144
02:28:59,597 --> 02:29:01,121
- And what?
- That...

1145
02:29:01,599 --> 02:29:05,763
when a woman is accused...
and labeled abandoned...

1146
02:29:07,204 --> 02:29:11,231
at the same time, people wait
to take advantage of her situation.

1147
02:29:12,209 --> 02:29:14,734
- But hats off to you, Nisha!
- Please sit.

1148
02:29:15,479 --> 02:29:18,448
You have erased the label
of an abandoned woman...

1149
02:29:20,217 --> 02:29:22,185
and made a new place for yourself!

1150
02:29:24,455 --> 02:29:27,253
Your courage must have shaken up
millions of women...

1151
02:29:27,625 --> 02:29:30,116
who in the eyes of the society,
wear a mask of a perfect wife...

1152
02:29:30,494 --> 02:29:32,462
but actually lead a stifling life!

1153
02:29:35,299 --> 02:29:39,065
It's the truth that a man and
a woman compliment each other...

1154
02:29:39,503 --> 02:29:43,803
but there is one more truth, a
woman is not only a man's shadow...

1155
02:29:44,175 --> 02:29:47,941
she has her own
personality and identity!

1156
02:29:51,248 --> 02:29:57,619
I am sure you remember, years back,
I repeated the words you wrote...

1157
02:29:58,556 --> 02:30:03,687
that seasons keep changing,
I had also said...

1158
02:30:04,195 --> 02:30:07,096
that I can wait for
the season to change.

1159
02:30:14,538 --> 02:30:18,030
Nisha, look into my eyes.

1160
02:30:19,543 --> 02:30:23,741
Look at yourself in my eyes,
the autumn of your life has ended...

1161
02:30:25,549 --> 02:30:32,182
there is a tiny bud waiting to
bloom in the spring of life!

1162
02:30:43,267 --> 02:30:52,403
Alok, what will people say if
they hear that in this age...

1163
02:30:54,812 --> 02:30:57,212
Is that all?

1164
02:30:58,582 --> 02:31:01,881
Nisha, when the world never
cared about your feelings...

1165
02:31:02,253 --> 02:31:04,778
then why are you
concerned about them?

1166
02:31:05,723 --> 02:31:11,161
One more thing, a man can get spring
in his life whenever he pleases...

1167
02:31:11,595 --> 02:31:14,792
then why should there be
autumn in a woman's life forever?

1168
02:31:18,302 --> 02:31:19,564
Answer me...

1169
02:31:20,704 --> 02:31:23,571
why is it so?
