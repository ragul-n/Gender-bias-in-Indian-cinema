00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:00,825
'Yet another page of the
countless pages written on love.'

2
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:03,597
'One that nature seems
to have dressed in leisure..

3
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,463
"With its colours.'

4
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:08,767
'This is the story
of our Mark and Soniyo.'

5
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:11,567
I want him. I want her.

6
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:13,769
They are going to be our stars.

7
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,781
Mark. Soniyo.

8
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,116
'It has been said".

9
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:27,988
..even the time that a leaf breaking
off from the tree is preordained.'

10
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:32,763
'Nothing happens before
its set time or after.'

11
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:36,361
'And this was Mark
and Soniyds love story.'

12
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:40,602
'Life gave Mark and Soniyo
several occasions to meet.'

13
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:43,940
'Once they met for this
advertisement for kindergarten.'

14
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:47,233
Mark, be careful.

15
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:50,744
'Another time they bumped into
each other at the pastry shop.'

16
00:02:51,237 --> 00:02:52,648
Oh god! So sorry.

17
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:53,844
What happened, baby?

18
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:55,617
He spoiled me.

19
00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:59,052
Don't worry.
I'll get a new one, okay.

20
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,659
He's a bad boy.

21
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:06,658
Marky, are you crazy or what?
You come. Come, come.

22
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:09,524
What you think am I fool, bad boy.

23
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:17,700
'Other times they chanced
upon each other on the street.'

24
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:20,602
Hey, what are you doing?

25
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:22,941
Sorry.

26
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:26,608
'The series of coincidental
meetings went on this way.'

27
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:30,843
'But perhaps destiny
was waiting for another time.'

28
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:54,535
"Flowers are blooming
and he is fast asleep."

29
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:58,547
"It seems like he has planted
a dream in a ﬂowerpot of sleep."

30
00:03:58,838 --> 00:04:02,718
"An angel will appear
with a magic wand."

31
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:07,085
"In a snap she will put
the scattered stuff in order."

32
00:04:11,217 --> 00:04:15,222
"He postpones all
his chores to tomorrow."

33
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:19,302
"The sun has been shining
on his face for long."

34
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:23,371
"Valentine's day is here
bringing colour to life."

35
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:27,544
"But his calendar still
shows it is October."

36
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:32,908
"This is a strange game.
It is a blend of relations."

37
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:36,248
"Searching for joy here and there."

38
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:41,091
"This is a mystery.
It is nice and dandy."

39
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:43,988
"Some complications
are unravelled here."

40
00:05:07,106 --> 00:05:12,818
"The heart is alert here,
kind of like a doe."

41
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:21,957
"A mystical melody keeps playing."

42
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:29,574
"The day dawns on seeing her."

43
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:39,410
"Anyone who sees her
weaves a million dreams."

44
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:44,086
"Things come in
order at her touch."

45
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:48,349
"Nature corrects her clock."

46
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:50,528
"The sun borrows
light from her glow."

47
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:52,324
"The day ends in her tresses."

48
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:56,397
"The sun goes crazy
and moves to her tune."

49
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:01,738
"They are so incompatible.
They are no match."

50
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:05,104
"Looking for happiness
here and there."

51
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:09,979
"This is a mystery.
It is nice and dandy."

52
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:13,012
"Some complications
are unravelled here."

53
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:18,254
"This is a strange game.
It is a blend of relations."

54
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:21,958
"Searching for joy here and there."

55
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:26,563
"This is a mystery.
It is nice and dandy."

56
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:30,360
"Some complications
are unravelled here."

57
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:49,177
Yes, exactly. Exactly what I said.

58
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:50,209
Correct.

59
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:51,947
Excuse me, please.

60
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:53,679
What?

61
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:57,285
You don't look like you're
from this college. I card please.

62
00:06:57,617 --> 00:06:58,618
H ey!

63
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:00,924
They are with me.

64
00:07:01,654 --> 00:07:05,192
Thomas, my boy,
you know the rules of this college.

65
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,405
Outsiders aren't allowed inside.

66
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:12,038
You want me to demonstrate
my rule to you in the corner?

67
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,572
Oh no, Thomas.
I don't want to go to the corner.

68
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:17,370
You may enter.

69
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:19,274
Come along.

70
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:22,613
You have great say
in this college, brother.

71
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:23,676
Continue to observe.

72
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:24,877
Hey Vinay!

73
00:07:25,077 --> 00:07:27,921
Look my attitude. Let's enjoy.

74
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:33,190
Hey, do you have a license
to ride the bicycle?

75
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:36,098
But a license is not
required to ride a bicycle.

76
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,962
Brother says you need a license"

77
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,560
..so you must get
it made right away.

78
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:44,207
I ow lift the cycle
on your shoulder and leave.

79
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,506
What are you waiting for, you dope?

80
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:49,638
Hey! Who's that?

81
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:54,145
Thomas, please give me the ball.

82
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:56,218
What if I don't?

83
00:07:56,375 --> 00:08:00,824
"Marky! Everyone will be crazy."

84
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,618
Give me the ball or else.

85
00:08:03,182 --> 00:08:04,183
Or else what?

86
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:14,433
Or else I'll go complain
to the Principal, get it.

87
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:19,171
Hey sissy, show me your
strength and take the ball.

88
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:22,545
Why you dragging the Principal
into this, you weakling?

89
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:24,715
You're the <i>sissy</i>
who needs hired hands.

90
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:27,683
..to show your strength, get that?

91
00:08:27,773 --> 00:08:29,013
Damn you!

92
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:37,352
"Everyone will be crazy."

93
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:40,522
Thomas, you've crossed
all the boundaries today.

94
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:42,523
So what will you do?

95
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:48,032
I can do plenty,
but I need to clip the power..

96
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:52,371
..you are demonstrating
today because of these outsiders.

97
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:53,871
Get him

98
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:58,144
Beat him.
- Damn you!

99
00:09:37,376 --> 00:09:38,377
Look him!

100
00:09:45,851 --> 00:09:47,228
Nlarky!

101
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,697
Come here. Come here.
- Io!

102
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:57,203
Troublemaker!

103
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:01,503
Baldy, if I see you in the lane
outside, much less this college..

104
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:06,415
...I'll build a new college
on your head, get it. Go!

105
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:23,823
Cheers!

106
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:28,060
Hey headlight.

107
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:30,199
I'm the one who got into a ﬁght.
- Yes.

108
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:32,170
So why is your face swollen?

109
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:34,842
Mark, you know our
headlighfs problem.

110
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:38,145
He loses his eyesight by 6:00 PM.

111
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:39,114
So?

112
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:40,707
Last night..
- Hey"

113
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,378
Let him tell, let him tell.
- Sit back and relax.

114
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:44,410
Last night he went to
say I love you to Seema Lagoo.

115
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:45,512
At her home.

116
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,019
Only when he got
a slap on his face"

117
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:49,754
..did he realise it
was her mother Reema Lagoo.

118
00:10:50,616 --> 00:10:51,560
Then, then, then, then.

119
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:54,929
Then she had a slipper in
her hand with his cheek in front.

120
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,364
I plucked the courage.
I went to her house.

121
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:57,833
I've told you so many times"

122
00:10:58,024 --> 00:10:59,697
..to do something about your
condition. - What can I do?

123
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,500
Or you'll be in great trouble
someday, I'm warning you.

124
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:04,905
Look, Charmy from the
ﬁrst year is coming this way.

125
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,277
Bablu, the moon rises at night,
doesn't it?

126
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,177
So how come it's
shown up during the day?

127
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:14,273
That's right.

128
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:17,984
Reshma, owls make a sound at night,
don't they?

129
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,789
So how come it's making
a sound during the day?

130
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,629
Why do you let
them insult you, man.

131
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:27,219
You keep your mouth shut.

132
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:30,397
When the squint girl from
the third year swore at you..

133
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:33,096
..were you revered then?
Weren't you insulted then?

134
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:34,468
He forgot.

135
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:36,700
Who? Pammi?
- Yes, her.

136
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:39,399
What do you see
in that squint girl?

137
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:40,910
Why are you chasing her?

138
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:48,681
One of her eyes is so beautiful
even the other eye looks at it.

139
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:50,345
You know?

140
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:53,882
Let's go play cricket.

141
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:54,922
Cricket?

142
00:11:54,947 --> 00:11:57,791
What cricket? We have
professor Vaswani's class now.

143
00:11:58,084 --> 00:12:01,622
If we miss even one class, we
will surely fail at Math this time.

144
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:05,763
Oh freak, Vaswani!
Someone get him to miss class.

145
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:07,097
Mark, please do something.

146
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:08,196
That's right.
- I ow".

147
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:12,141
Professor Sneh
ata's protest
can save us from class.

148
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:14,875
Friends, are you with ma? Come on.

149
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,311
Yes! Yes! Yes!

150
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:22,485
We won't permit the stink from
that toilet to reach our college.

151
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:24,412
Man, I can't endure this protest.

152
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:29,259
Look straight ahead, you pumpkin!

153
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:32,221
The municipality must take action!

154
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:35,131
They must move the toilet from there.
-We look like losers, man!

155
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:38,859
Everybody pick up the
placards and join the protest.

156
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:44,637
A toilet cannot prevail
where our college exists!

157
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:50,271
A toilet cannot prevail
where our college exists!

158
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:55,045
Hey, let's go!
Come, come, come, come.

159
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:56,385
C'mon!

160
00:12:56,408 --> 00:13:00,948
A toilet cannot prevail
where our college exists!

161
00:13:01,313 --> 00:13:02,849
They will never mend
their ways, father.

162
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:04,793
They marked their
attendance in the protest..

163
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,258
..so they could bunk class.

164
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:09,296
And they disappeared from
the protest within ﬁve minutes.

165
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:11,960
I was very tempted to
exposing the four of them.

166
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:14,768
I remained silent because
he is Meenu's brother.

167
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:18,269
Cool it, my dear. Cool it.

168
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,443
I don't send you to college"

169
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,571
..so you might get
involved in these muddles.

170
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:26,309
Keep your mind on your
studies and your grades.

171
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:31,447
In any case it is unbecoming
of girls to deal with louts.

172
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:33,551
And keep control on your anger.

173
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:35,290
You are old enough to marry..

174
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,691
..and you're running
around being a do-gooder.

175
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:41,159
Sons, are the payments
coming on time?

176
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:44,660
What can I do, father?
A lot of money is tied up.

177
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:46,431
Nobody makes payments on time.

178
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:49,199
Father, I think if I go to
all the offices and make a noise..

179
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:50,262
"than perhaps.

180
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:55,344
Look boys,
the payment should come in on time.

181
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:57,570
You may do what you
please to achieve this.

182
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:01,908
Io, my boy,
we don't want any ﬁghts.

183
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:03,718
We aren't that kind of people.

184
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:05,917
And what son of a father are you?

185
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:08,216
You are teaching your
sons the wrong things.

186
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:13,494
Okay Pammi, starting today
you manage our business.

187
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:15,858
..and we shall manage your kitchen.

188
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:18,190
Nonsense!

189
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,769
Give me ﬁve. Give me ﬁve.

190
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:26,868
Hello sir.

191
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,167
May we enter?

192
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:29,969
Oh no!

193
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:34,609
The veterans of our college,
our stars on earth"

194
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:38,711
..our backbench scholars
have ﬁnally arrived in college.

195
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:40,156
Applause.

196
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:41,749
Thank you, thank you.
Thank you, guys.

197
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:42,857
Silence.

198
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:44,553
Tell me, why have you arrived late?

199
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:47,329
Come on, sir, how could
we come late for your class? -Yes.

200
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:49,264
We're here for the next class"
- Vaswani.

201
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:51,665
We're here early for professor
Vaswani's class. You see?

202
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:54,135
Silence!

203
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:55,331
Io point talking to you.

204
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:58,234
Why don't you just get out!
Get lost!

205
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:00,542
Really?

206
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:08,474
Io, it's correct. Sometimes
one should come late to class.

207
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,645
Good boy! Good boy! Go, sit. Sit.

208
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:11,944
We'll learn.

209
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:13,579
Sit, sit.
- Come.

210
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:16,526
All is well. All is well.

211
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:22,964
Today we shall learn
how to identify a species.

212
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:24,934
"through the body pans.

213
00:15:25,157 --> 00:15:27,034
Any questions? All clear?

214
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:28,727
Very clear, sir.

215
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:33,475
You came in only just now
and it's all clear for you. How'?

216
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,340
Yes sir. That's because
you are a great teacher..

217
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:38,972
..and I am a great student.

218
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:41,549
Very good, my bright student!

219
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:45,317
Low tell me to which
bird do those legs belong?

220
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:46,813
That, sir?

221
00:15:49,181 --> 00:15:50,683
I don't know that, sir.

222
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:52,023
You don't know? I know.

223
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:54,364
The Principal will
answer your question.

224
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:56,432
The bell has rung.

225
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:58,861
Anyway, I'll leave now.
I'll deal with you later.

226
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:00,435
I will ﬁx them.

227
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:02,400
The rascal regards
himself a good actor.

228
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,270
Vaswani.

229
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:08,142
These students are very naughty.

230
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:10,171
Teach them a lesson?

231
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,551
You four! Get up.

232
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:21,413
Low get out.

233
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:24,257
He's teaching them
a lesson upon arrival.

234
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:28,931
Despite the last warning
you missed the last class. Out!

235
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:30,828
But for a good cause, sir.

236
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:33,668
Ma'am Sneh
ata's toilet protest.

237
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:39,536
Oh, the toilet protest!
Sit down, sit down.

238
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:44,503
So class,
every student has a dream.

239
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:48,082
Your brother Veer and his
friends will come to naught.

240
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:50,576
Why don't you speak to Veer?

241
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:52,581
What do I say to him?

242
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:55,616
We are twins but our
minds are very diverse.

243
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:59,289
And in any case,
when father has given up on him..

244
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:00,762
..what could I possibly do?

245
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:02,955
lever mind.
They will come to naught.

246
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:08,369
Mark, come here, boy.
Dinner's on the table.

247
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:09,929
Come to the chair quickly.

248
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,308
Mark!

249
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:16,335
Mario!

250
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:23,619
Mark, Don't thank this
father if you don't want to..

251
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:27,151
..but at least thank god,
the father before you eat.

252
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:29,459
Oh god, pop! Give me a break.

253
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:32,519
Thank you, god,
for giving us this lovely meal".

254
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,959
..and for the good
appetite to eat it.

255
00:17:35,687 --> 00:17:37,189
Learn from your brother.

256
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,301
Very good boy, Mario! Very nice!

257
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:41,871
Very good boy, Mario!
Very good! Idiot!

258
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:49,611
What's the matter, pop?
The food is delicious today.

259
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:56,581
If you must praise someone,
praise your mummy.

260
00:17:56,909 --> 00:18:00,049
She taught me to cook this food.

261
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:02,887
Had she been alive today,
you know how pleased she'd be?

262
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:04,756
Oh god! Stop it, pop.

263
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:06,729
Why do you get so sentimental
every two minutes?

264
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:10,463
So Mario, did you tell pop..

265
00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:12,195
..how much you scored
in the math exam?

266
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:13,699
Shut up, Mark!

267
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:15,829
How much did you score?

268
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:18,603
I'll tell. The math
paper is one hundred marks.

269
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:21,811
He didn't understand questions
amounting to twenty marks.

270
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:23,842
He didn't see questions
amounting to thirty marks..

271
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,707
..and he didn't know the answers.

272
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:27,148
..to questions amounting
to ﬁfty marks.

273
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:29,443
What does that leave, Mario?

274
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,286
You see this egg.
This is left. Eat it.

275
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:33,254
I'll hit you.

276
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:34,723
Mark, stop hitting him!

277
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:38,392
And Mario,
why do I send you to school?

278
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:41,121
To study, not to lay eggs.

279
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:42,154
Very bad! Very bad!

280
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:47,327
In any case, this is my problem.

281
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:49,531
"because if you're
mother had been alive"

282
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:52,368
"would he go lay eggs in school.

283
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:53,171
0h gosh!

284
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:55,109
Oh god, please stop it, pop.

285
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:56,846
Even the two of us miss mama..

286
00:18:57,035 --> 00:18:58,412
..but to get so sentimental
every two minutes.

287
00:18:58,504 --> 00:18:59,505
Grow up, man!

288
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:01,006
H ey!

289
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,781
Don't be too smart.
Don't try to be my father.

290
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:04,943
Eat quietly.

291
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,919
This duffer Mario started this.

292
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:08,590
You called me duffer?
- Yes.

293
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,555
ll ow you will suffer.
- Really?

294
00:19:10,582 --> 00:19:12,823
Dad broke your ugly glass pad.

295
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:17,496
What?! That was my
favourite piece. Oh you!

296
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,542
Mark! Mark!

297
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:30,607
Mark! Come on, man!

298
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:32,709
Come on out. Where are you?

299
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:33,906
Mark!

300
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:39,583
Why are you howling? You
want to give the dogs a complex.

301
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:40,646
Where are you?

302
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:41,747
Over here.

303
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:44,554
Mark, give me ﬁve hundred rupees.

304
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:45,320
Why?

305
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,193
I was returning from Juhu
and met her on the street.

306
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:50,257
She kissed me all the way here.

307
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,259
She's so beautiful!

308
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:54,532
What are you saying, man?

309
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,268
If you see her you'll tell
me to give her one thousand.

310
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:01,967
Honey, you're coming or..

311
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:07,514
I left the house to sweet".

312
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:10,687
..and I see a sweatshop here.

313
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:12,483
Ooh la la la.

314
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,654
Hello, baby.

315
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:17,761
What a handsome hunk!

316
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:20,988
Honey, would you like to join us..

317
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:23,157
..for some naughty, naughty"

318
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:25,065
Didn't I tell you she's hot?

319
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:27,831
Excuse us just one minute, please.

320
00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:31,172
Hurry up!

321
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:35,905
Headlight, your madam
was once upon a time Adam.

322
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:38,913
What? Nonsense!
You are jealous of me.

323
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:42,017
That's why you're calling
my fair lady a man.

324
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:44,980
You dope, this isn't a lady.
You are insane.

325
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:48,353
Trust me. Or shall I
get pop and Mario to conﬁrm?

326
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:52,590
Oh no. But see
how sexy she is, man!

327
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:55,790
Okay, you go with her and at
night you'll automatically know..

328
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:57,591
"whether she's sexy or a dude.

329
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:04,837
Oh man! Oh man! Who have
I been kissing on the way here?

330
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,805
Honey, what happened? What's wrong?

331
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:14,143
Actually I think he's
feeling slightly unwell.

332
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,145
Poor chap! So sad!

333
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:22,783
Anyway, what about you,
my haughty, naughty, poochie?

334
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,856
Madam, I don't believe
in back door entry.

335
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:29,999
Hey dude, don't be so rude!

336
00:21:30,188 --> 00:21:30,825
<i>0K3‘!-</i>

337
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:32,335
Anyway, it's your loss.

338
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:35,428
You'll look for me
after I leave. Loser!

339
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:37,164
You wasted my time.

340
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:39,499
What are you smiling at?

341
00:21:39,564 --> 00:21:43,068
Sorry ma'am. They don't know
a good thing when they see it.

342
00:21:44,002 --> 00:21:45,640
Why don't you focus on ma?

343
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:48,280
Everything goes for me.

344
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:51,511
Shut up, idiot!
I'll kick you on your focus.

345
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:53,316
Damn you! Drop me off at home.

346
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:54,346
<i>0K3‘!-</i>

347
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,486
You crossed the line today.

348
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:58,992
Why do you go out when
you can't see at night?

349
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:00,119
What can I do?
- Forget it.

350
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:01,825
Let's have a drink. Come.
- Yes, let's go.

351
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:04,860
Mark.
- Yes.

352
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:08,269
You rescued me once again.
You are very cool.

353
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,907
But my night blinders
are the worst rascals.

354
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:14,266
So is my brother too.

355
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:15,501
Who? Mario.

356
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:17,476
Why do you tease him so?

357
00:22:17,969 --> 00:22:19,539
He is very simple.

358
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,615
If I don't tease him today"

359
00:22:22,908 --> 00:22:26,879
..dudes like us will
tease him in future.

360
00:22:27,713 --> 00:22:29,158
You are right, Marky.

361
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:34,219
I'd like to tell you something
from the heart today.

362
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:39,998
When all the pages
of my life are over"

363
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:44,231
..and god gives me
one chance to read them.

364
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:49,837
...I will start with the
page where I met you, Marky.

365
00:22:50,602 --> 00:22:51,546
You are drunk.

366
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:52,571
Io.

367
00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:55,213
I'll will keep drinking today"

368
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,651
I'll will keep drinking"

369
00:22:56,975 --> 00:23:00,115
...until the two trees in
front of seem like four to me.

370
00:23:01,446 --> 00:23:02,948
Then you're deﬁnitely drunk.

371
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:05,055
Because there's only
one tree in front.

372
00:23:05,283 --> 00:23:08,196
What? They chop so many trees.

373
00:23:08,353 --> 00:23:09,627
They chop so many trees.

374
00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:11,457
There were so many trees here.

375
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:12,593
You buffoon!

376
00:23:18,663 --> 00:23:19,835
Look, look.

377
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:21,571
I think this"
- Look here.

378
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:25,781
He looks like your Adam.

379
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:28,043
Listen to him.

380
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:34,183
What's he saying?

381
00:23:36,214 --> 00:23:37,215
Oh no!

382
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:55,467
Forget him.

383
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:00,276
I'll be back right away.

384
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:05,610
Listen!

385
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:07,782
Someday look here.

386
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:15,987
Your zip is open.

387
00:24:18,657 --> 00:24:19,658
Yeah.

388
00:24:20,725 --> 00:24:21,499
Oh shit!

389
00:24:21,526 --> 00:24:22,527
0h god!

390
00:24:25,363 --> 00:24:26,808
Let it go. Come.

391
00:24:31,336 --> 00:24:32,576
Hello sir.

392
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:35,416
The college geniuses are here.

393
00:24:36,107 --> 00:24:38,986
Tell me, you don't make
an appearance in my class"

394
00:24:39,544 --> 00:24:41,421
..so how come you show
up in Vaswani's class?

395
00:24:41,513 --> 00:24:44,119
Actually sir, we have
difﬁculty understand math"

396
00:24:44,182 --> 00:24:45,923
"but biology is super easy.

397
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:49,464
You clowns! If this goes on,
you will fail in biology.

398
00:24:49,721 --> 00:24:52,258
Look at the other students.
They are so interested.

399
00:24:52,357 --> 00:24:53,392
So many questions.

400
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:55,802
And you guys don't ask
any questions or interest.

401
00:24:56,461 --> 00:24:58,236
Io sir, we have a question too.

402
00:24:58,263 --> 00:25:00,030
Very good! Very good! Ask, ask.

403
00:25:00,031 --> 00:25:01,408
You recall the other day you said..

404
00:25:01,433 --> 00:25:03,310
..if someone suffers
an asthma attack"

405
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:06,243
"one such blow in their
mouth for a long duration.

406
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:08,342
Oh yeah, correct.
Correct. Very good!

407
00:25:08,573 --> 00:25:10,575
So sir, my question is,
what can we do..

408
00:25:10,742 --> 00:25:12,744
..to cause a girl
to have an asthma attack?

409
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,887
Come here, headlight.
Come, come here.

410
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:21,820
Sea, why don't you show her
your face? -Yes sir.

411
00:25:22,787 --> 00:25:25,199
She will suffer a heart attack
along with an asthma attack.

412
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,608
Why is he messing with you?

413
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:40,472
Come.

414
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,683
Alright class, get seated.

415
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:45,982
Here are your test papers.

416
00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:49,588
He's giving us a test.
- What test is this?

417
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:50,785
I don't know.

418
00:25:53,585 --> 00:25:55,656
Mark. Mark, sit here.

419
00:26:00,258 --> 00:26:02,636
Alright now. Silence everybody.

420
00:26:02,827 --> 00:26:04,101
And you can start.

421
00:26:06,264 --> 00:26:09,973
"We don't know anything.
Know nothing."

422
00:26:14,205 --> 00:26:17,516
"History complicates
us in its mystery."

423
00:26:17,542 --> 00:26:21,581
"When the exams are
on the heart palpitates."

424
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:27,686
Thanks.

425
00:26:28,553 --> 00:26:29,554
For what?

426
00:26:30,956 --> 00:26:34,369
"Normally a hero
but a zero at studies."

427
00:26:38,697 --> 00:26:42,076
"When the whole class
bunks but you fail."

428
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:46,147
"Without work how can you success."

429
00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:48,740
Thanks.

430
00:26:49,507 --> 00:26:50,485
For what?

431
00:26:50,508 --> 00:26:51,043
This.

432
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:53,715
This. - "Our life's
funda is very good."

433
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:58,291
You left it blank?

434
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,693
Tell him. You don't understand.

435
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:01,129
What's up? What's up? What's up?

436
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,431
I have a major problem, Mark.

437
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:07,162
I knew no answers in today's
test so I left the paper blank.

438
00:27:07,592 --> 00:27:09,196
Even Bablu left the paper blank.

439
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:10,732
Yes, so what?

440
00:27:11,696 --> 00:27:12,902
What are you talking, man?

441
00:27:13,031 --> 00:27:14,704
ll ow professor Vaswani
is going to think..

442
00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:16,041
"we copied each other.

443
00:27:17,268 --> 00:27:18,508
Well said.

444
00:27:19,204 --> 00:27:20,205
Silly boy!

445
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:22,747
That reminds me.

446
00:27:23,174 --> 00:27:25,279
Why did Soniyo let
you copy from her?

447
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:27,716
Yes.
- What's going on?

448
00:27:28,013 --> 00:27:29,993
I don't like to kiss and tell.
- Indeed.

449
00:27:30,081 --> 00:27:33,028
You guys know all the
girls are crazy about me.

450
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,996
All of them do
things to impress me.

451
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:38,896
Forget it. I can't tell
you everything about all.

452
00:27:41,126 --> 00:27:42,230
Oh, really?

453
00:27:46,364 --> 00:27:48,366
I was referring to other girls.

454
00:27:48,533 --> 00:27:50,171
I see.
- Obviously not you.

455
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:52,042
Lot you, obviously. Io..

456
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:54,509
You really hurt me.
- Soniyo!

457
00:27:55,807 --> 00:27:57,718
Shit! Are you pleased now?

458
00:27:58,076 --> 00:27:59,885
I too will have to
leave the next paper blank.

459
00:28:00,145 --> 00:28:02,682
And Vaswani will think the
three of copied from each other.

460
00:28:03,581 --> 00:28:04,582
Idiots!

461
00:28:06,885 --> 00:28:08,592
Bablu, do something.

462
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,891
You saw Soniyo got upset and left.

463
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:12,495
You really hate me, Mark.

464
00:28:12,624 --> 00:28:13,625
What can I do?

465
00:28:14,426 --> 00:28:16,201
Why are you stressing over this?

466
00:28:16,661 --> 00:28:18,937
Every Sunday Soniya
goes to Veer's house"

467
00:28:18,997 --> 00:28:20,499
..to play badminton with Meenu.

468
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:24,003
You meet her there
and apologize to her.

469
00:28:24,602 --> 00:28:25,603
That's all.

470
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:51,768
Who's looking for trouble?

471
00:28:56,701 --> 00:28:57,702
Who is it?

472
00:28:59,971 --> 00:29:01,644
It is l, Mark, uncle.

473
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:05,918
Mark uncle? Mark uncle who?

474
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:09,748
Uncle, I'm Mark, you are uncle.

475
00:29:10,682 --> 00:29:13,663
Oh Mark! Our Mark. - Yes, uncle.

476
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:15,331
Come on in. Come.

477
00:29:16,454 --> 00:29:20,766
You ass, most people enter
through the door, not the window.

478
00:29:21,025 --> 00:29:22,026
Come. Take a seat.

479
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,274
Good morning, uncle.

480
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:32,410
What's the matter, boy?

481
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:37,045
Your morning is good
so early on a Sunday?

482
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:41,446
Didn't you party like
Saturday night fever?

483
00:29:41,646 --> 00:29:43,387
Io, uncle. I was at home.

484
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:45,150
Really, my b0!!-

00:29:45,216 --> 00:29:46,058

00:29:46,084 --> 00:29:47,927
You had a large peg last night..

487
00:29:48,219 --> 00:29:50,256
..and pulling a fast one over ma?

488
00:29:53,391 --> 00:29:54,461
ls aunty at home?

489
00:29:54,526 --> 00:29:58,235
Io, my boy, she ran away
with Salman Khan this morning.

490
00:29:58,263 --> 00:29:59,264
What?

491
00:30:00,431 --> 00:30:03,810
You ass! Where will your aunty go?

492
00:30:04,202 --> 00:30:05,408
She must be at home.

493
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:09,347
Low tell me, are you here
to see aunty or to see Veer?

494
00:30:09,841 --> 00:30:11,548
If you're hereto see Veer"

495
00:30:11,709 --> 00:30:13,950
..you have no chance
of doing so until noon.

496
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:18,825
When you didn't call out to him,
"Oh Veeru!" I guessed.

497
00:30:20,251 --> 00:30:21,195
I'll go see aunty.

498
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:22,960
Talk to me ﬁrst, boy.

499
00:30:23,054 --> 00:30:24,055
Okay, uncle.

500
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:29,671
Low tell me, do Veer and
you intend to pass this year?

501
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,967
We sure intend to do so but
I don't know about the teacher.

502
00:30:32,363 --> 00:30:33,068
What do you mean?

503
00:30:33,097 --> 00:30:35,373
Read the paper.
Lose weight now, ask me how.

504
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,002
Page sixteen.
Read it, read it, read it.

505
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,514
Lose weight now, ask me how.

506
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,241
Yeah!

507
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:44,342
Punjabi!

508
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:46,586
Punjabi!

509
00:30:46,644 --> 00:30:48,089
Hi aunty.

510
00:30:48,413 --> 00:30:51,417
You're up early, son?
Veer is still..

511
00:30:51,783 --> 00:30:52,761
I know, I know, I know.

512
00:30:52,784 --> 00:30:53,785
Okay sit.

513
00:31:00,124 --> 00:31:01,330
What are you looking for?

514
00:31:01,426 --> 00:31:03,599
Nothing. I wanted some fresh air.

515
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:09,168
We are preparing
mango pickle. - Yes.

516
00:31:09,601 --> 00:31:11,774
Why don't you taste some
pickle with your fresh air.

517
00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:12,904
Cool!

518
00:31:13,304 --> 00:31:15,910
Oh, hi Meenu. How are you?

519
00:31:19,077 --> 00:31:20,920
Aunty, what do you put in this?

520
00:31:21,746 --> 00:31:24,784
Son, obviously a mango
pickle will have mangoes, my boy.

521
00:31:24,816 --> 00:31:25,886
Oh yeah. Right.

522
00:31:26,618 --> 00:31:28,529
Incidentally even my
mom used to prepare pickles.

523
00:31:29,153 --> 00:31:30,655
Fish pickle. With ﬁsh.

524
00:31:30,755 --> 00:31:31,563
Fish?

525
00:31:31,589 --> 00:31:33,091
Yes. It's very famous in Goa.

526
00:31:33,691 --> 00:31:34,965
Although even this is very yummy.

527
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:38,233
So take some with you.
Mario can have some.

529
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:42,067

Meenu, today is Sunday.
Io badminton in the garden?

531
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:51,783
Her partner hasn't come today.

532
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,282
Where is Soniyo?

533
00:31:53,444 --> 00:31:54,980
One of her cousin's
is getting married.

534
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,888
She must be busy with
the wedding procession.

535
00:31:57,348 --> 00:31:58,759
Low way she's coming today.

536
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:00,161
Thanks.

537
00:32:01,786 --> 00:32:02,787
For the pickle.

538
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:05,492
The pickle.

539
00:32:07,492 --> 00:32:09,267
Since there's no chance
of seeing Veer before noon..

540
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:11,039

541
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:14,474
I just wanted to tell him,

542
00:32:14,732 --> 00:32:15,733
Bye.

543
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,409
Stop it, stop it.

544
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:22,707
It's going in my eyes.

545
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:27,646
Mark, tell me something.

546
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:28,924
Yes.

547
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:30,756
Why did you come to
my house early this morning?

548
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:32,323
Morning walk.

549
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:34,696
At my house?

550
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:36,255
Yes, I was passing from there..

551
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:38,229
..so I thought
of passing some time.

552
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:40,731
Passing time at my house?

553
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:44,072
Am I in such dire straits?
- Damn you!

554
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:53,571
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

555
00:32:53,705 --> 00:32:56,345
It's evening and it's
getting cold over here.

556
00:32:56,774 --> 00:32:57,684
Let's go.

557
00:32:57,742 --> 00:32:59,153
Oh really! Silly aunty.

558
00:33:00,411 --> 00:33:03,085
Pop must be waiting
up for me for dinner, boys.

559
00:33:03,414 --> 00:33:04,950
And Mario must be starving.

560
00:33:05,216 --> 00:33:06,695
I'm leaving. Bye.

561
00:33:10,955 --> 00:33:12,400
Meet us at night after dinner.

562
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:13,424
Yes, okay, okay.

563
00:33:43,988 --> 00:33:45,228
Mark! What is he doing here?

564
00:33:45,256 --> 00:33:47,167
What's the matter, boy? Come.

565
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:50,298
Thanks, brother.
- What happened, son?

566
00:33:54,065 --> 00:33:55,009
I love wedding processions.

567
00:33:55,066 --> 00:33:56,807
Come join the procession.

568
00:34:15,686 --> 00:34:17,165
I'll be back right away, brother.

569
00:34:19,857 --> 00:34:20,892
Soniya.
- Yes.

570
00:34:23,194 --> 00:34:25,105
Actually I came to apologize.

571
00:34:27,298 --> 00:34:29,778
You came up all
the way here for this?

572
00:34:30,668 --> 00:34:33,581
Obviously.
I don't know to dance that dance.

573
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,849
You might as well learn
now that you're here.

574
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:38,910
Just do this.

575
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:55,735
Your belt is open and
your trouser has dropped down.

576
00:35:04,402 --> 00:35:06,211
Why are your briefs wet?

577
00:35:07,338 --> 00:35:08,339
Oh!

578
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:09,774
What's the matter, son?

579
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:11,275
Strange thing.

580
00:35:12,143 --> 00:35:14,589
Go change your trousers
if you want to.

581
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:16,950
Strange man!

582
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:19,759
And you should have
seen his face then.

583
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:21,119
Really?

584
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:23,356
Oh my god! That was so funny.

585
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:25,627
If that wasn't all
our Bunty questioned him.

586
00:35:25,756 --> 00:35:26,962
Why are your briefs wet?

587
00:35:30,061 --> 00:35:32,268
Do you have a second?
- What?

588
00:35:32,997 --> 00:35:33,998
<i>Ms“.</i>

589
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,236
Kiss?!
- lot kiss.

590
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,801
Tale, tale.

591
00:35:38,336 --> 00:35:41,215
The tale about the wet briefs
and trousers dropping down.

592
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,815
Please don't tell anyone or..

593
00:35:44,942 --> 00:35:46,649
I know. Or what?

594
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:48,958
What are you discussing
on the street?

595
00:35:49,113 --> 00:35:52,390
Shut up! I just felt like".

596
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:56,823
Felt like?
You feel like anything at any time.

597
00:35:56,954 --> 00:35:57,989
Damn you!

598
00:35:58,356 --> 00:35:59,391
Let's go, let's go!

599
00:35:59,524 --> 00:36:00,468
I'm going.

600
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:04,133
You hear that, Meenu?

601
00:36:04,262 --> 00:36:06,742
He feels like doing
anything any time.

602
00:36:08,432 --> 00:36:09,137
Yes right.

603
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:11,511
We must win this time.
- Come on, man! I will do it.

604
00:36:11,636 --> 00:36:14,242
Bablu, will you give
an exam in ﬁreworks?

605
00:36:14,438 --> 00:36:15,314
Fireworks?

606
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:16,682
It is the festival of lights today,
isn't it?

607
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:17,817
Today?

608
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:18,616
Io.

609
00:36:18,643 --> 00:36:20,418
Then why is he glowing
like a lantern?

610
00:36:21,879 --> 00:36:23,950
Festival of lights,
lantern, ﬁreworks.

611
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:25,958
I'll light ﬁreworks
under you guys.

612
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:30,958
I told you today is my
sister Meenu's engagement.

613
00:36:30,988 --> 00:36:32,228
Oh no!

614
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:33,835
How could all of you forget?

615
00:36:34,292 --> 00:36:36,238
Bablu! Whose engagement is it?

616
00:36:36,294 --> 00:36:38,103
Meenu's. Who is Meenu's brother?

617
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:38,932
You.
- Yes.

618
00:36:38,963 --> 00:36:41,000
So you go. Who's stopping you?

619
00:36:41,432 --> 00:36:42,934
What will we do there?

620
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:45,540
In any case our pool competition
is today. - Yes.

621
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:47,379
In any case, we will lose
face if we don't go there.

622
00:36:47,405 --> 00:36:48,042
Yes.

623
00:36:48,072 --> 00:36:49,813
This concerns our reputation.
We have to go.

624
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,841
Yes, right. Come, come.

625
00:36:51,676 --> 00:36:54,555
Headlight! Come on, Bablu.

626
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:57,421
Oh no. He's shouting.
- We have our game.

627
00:36:57,448 --> 00:36:59,928
Does the pool game mean more to you
than my sister's engagement?

628
00:37:00,017 --> 00:37:01,052
Headlight! Bab
u..

629
00:37:01,085 --> 00:37:03,326
Stop, stop. Come out!
What are you doing?

630
00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:05,163
Didn't I tell you Mark would yell?

631
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:07,792
Headlight,
we have to go to the engagement.

632
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:08,859
Huh?

633
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,704
But the pool. Our reputation?

634
00:37:11,929 --> 00:37:14,239
Pool. Go drown in your pool.

635
00:37:14,865 --> 00:37:16,310
Does our reputation
mean more to us..

636
00:37:16,467 --> 00:37:17,878
"than Meenu's engagement?

637
00:37:18,102 --> 00:37:18,876
Nonsense!

638
00:37:18,936 --> 00:37:20,415
But you..
- Yes.

639
00:37:20,972 --> 00:37:22,212
I was kidding.

640
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,720
There will be many
more pool competitions.

641
00:37:25,042 --> 00:37:27,682
"but our one and only
Veer's one and only Meenu's..

642
00:37:27,945 --> 00:37:30,516
..one and only engagement
is only once in a lifetime.

643
00:37:30,848 --> 00:37:32,156
So drop all this and let's go.

644
00:37:32,216 --> 00:37:34,059
My buddy! Thank you, Mark!

645
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:36,330
You're my only true friend.
- Yes.

646
00:37:36,787 --> 00:37:38,130
Let's go, you scoundrels!

647
00:37:38,155 --> 00:37:39,361
Let's go, you scoundrels!

648
00:37:43,861 --> 00:37:45,534
Come along.
- Coming.

649
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:54,411
So it's a done deal?
- Of course it's a done deal!

650
00:37:54,672 --> 00:37:55,742
wow,

651
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:57,644
Congratulations!

652
00:37:57,908 --> 00:37:58,943
Congratulations!

653
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:00,680
Congratulations!

654
00:38:00,878 --> 00:38:01,879
Keep away evil eyes on you.

655
00:38:02,413 --> 00:38:03,983
Congratulations!
- Thank you.

656
00:38:14,725 --> 00:38:16,705
You? What is it?

657
00:38:17,061 --> 00:38:19,268
The food is ready, Veer's friends.

658
00:38:19,664 --> 00:38:21,109
Let's go eat.

659
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:25,113
Mark, got your plan man.

660
00:38:25,903 --> 00:38:28,042
That means game out.
And eat till we drop.

661
00:38:28,072 --> 00:38:30,143
Yes. You guys go and
I'll answer nature's call.

662
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:34,211
Hello, aunty.

663
00:38:35,446 --> 00:38:36,447
Yes coming.

664
00:38:39,016 --> 00:38:41,053
Soniyo looks pretty, doesn't she?

665
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:44,862
Yes. Her name beﬁts her qualities.

666
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:47,530
Why don't we make
her our daughter-in-law?

667
00:38:48,392 --> 00:38:51,100
Wonderful! You need to ask.

668
00:38:51,228 --> 00:38:52,229
Let go.

669
00:38:57,635 --> 00:38:58,636
Thanks.

670
00:38:59,904 --> 00:39:00,678
What for?

671
00:39:00,705 --> 00:39:04,710
For not telling anyone
the story of my trousers.

672
00:39:05,376 --> 00:39:06,480
Oh!

673
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:16,521
This is Mark.

674
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:17,690
Mark,
- Greetings, aunty.

675
00:39:17,722 --> 00:39:21,329
Meenu and Soniyo told
us the story of your trousers.

676
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:23,731
So this is brief boy.

677
00:39:25,796 --> 00:39:26,900
So sweet!

678
00:39:28,432 --> 00:39:29,843
He's such a nice boy.

679
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:35,275
You are too much.

680
00:39:44,081 --> 00:39:45,082
You know what?

681
00:39:46,684 --> 00:39:49,096
My parents are making
plans for my marriage.

682
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,492
What are you saying?

683
00:39:50,588 --> 00:39:51,589
Really?
- What?

684
00:39:51,856 --> 00:39:53,767
Really? Wow!

685
00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:55,693
With whom?

686
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:57,228
With Soniyo.

687
00:39:57,428 --> 00:39:58,133
Soniyo?

688
00:39:58,162 --> 00:40:01,735
But it doesn't matter to me.
I just don't want to get on a mare.

689
00:40:02,533 --> 00:40:03,534
What rubbish!

690
00:40:05,836 --> 00:40:07,782
He's right. He's only a kid.

691
00:40:08,038 --> 00:40:09,108
Sure, he's a kid.

692
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,881
We're here if he's
made to saddle a horse.

693
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:12,487
We'll bring him down in a snap.

694
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,753
Don't stress.

695
00:40:14,879 --> 00:40:17,450
Who's providing for ma?
My father or you?

696
00:40:18,816 --> 00:40:21,194
But Soniyo and you?

697
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:23,121
I mean, isn't it weird?

698
00:40:24,155 --> 00:40:26,362
Why? After all she's a Punjabi.

699
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:28,528
And our fathers are friends.

700
00:40:30,694 --> 00:40:32,002
She doesn't seem to be your type.

701
00:40:32,062 --> 00:40:33,063
Why?

702
00:40:33,697 --> 00:40:35,370
She's a girl, isn't she?

703
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:38,537
And if she were
a little more nasty..

704
00:40:38,803 --> 00:40:40,407
..then she would be my type.

705
00:40:41,505 --> 00:40:42,779
Amazing!
- Hey"

706
00:40:42,807 --> 00:40:46,414
Look at that girl.
She's just my type.

707
00:40:48,512 --> 00:40:50,719
What a sexy babe, man!

My Minnie mouse!

855
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:18,317
So how is my Soniyo?

856
00:51:19,309 --> 00:51:21,255
When she was little and
her dolls got misplaced".

857
00:51:21,278 --> 00:51:22,416
...I was always searched.

858
00:51:22,679 --> 00:51:25,250
Because they were found
with you four out of ten times.

859
00:51:25,982 --> 00:51:30,021
So I'm back. I'll bring
you as many dolls as you like.

860
00:51:32,355 --> 00:51:34,926
So girls, what's the plan?

871
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:17,972
Pasta vindaloo.

872
00:52:18,335 --> 00:52:18,938
What?

873
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:23,076
I tried something innovative
with a fusion of Italian and Goan.

874
00:52:23,406 --> 00:52:27,513
I see. And for whom are you
taking this fusion in confusion?

875
00:52:28,411 --> 00:52:29,412
Suzie.

876
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:32,252
You haven't lost your
milk teeth as yet, you imp..

877
00:52:32,749 --> 00:52:34,251
..and you already
have a girlfriend.

878
00:52:34,518 --> 00:52:37,931
Suzie is pop's age.
She runs a cooking class.

879
00:52:39,589 --> 00:52:41,193
But it's time for your
football now, isn't it?

880
00:52:41,525 --> 00:52:44,062
Only fat bullies come to football.

881
00:52:44,227 --> 00:52:48,004
They play less and
bother kids like me more.

882
00:52:48,231 --> 00:52:49,403
What are you saying, Mario?

883
00:52:49,466 --> 00:52:50,945
ls that why you bunk classes?

884
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:54,149
You take it in your stride
when I tease you at home.

885
00:52:54,371 --> 00:52:56,715
So why are you afraid
of a handful of stooges?

886
00:52:56,773 --> 00:52:59,913
I learn to survive
bullying from you at home"

887
00:53:00,043 --> 00:53:01,750
..so why should I waste
my money over there?

888
00:53:01,878 --> 00:53:02,856
I see.

889
00:53:02,879 --> 00:53:05,723
So you pay your football
fees to cooking aunty?

890
00:53:06,416 --> 00:53:09,022
Very smart, little rascal!
Does pop know?

891
00:53:09,252 --> 00:53:12,790
Oh no! You topped at football,
you topped at karate.

892
00:53:13,089 --> 00:53:15,160
<i>As it is pop considers me</i> a <i>sissy.</i>

893
00:53:15,425 --> 00:53:18,406
Oh Mario,
do you know how mature you are?

894
00:53:18,628 --> 00:53:21,837
And so responsible too.
Just like our mama.

895
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:24,611
You are my little man,
Mario Braganza.

896
00:53:24,968 --> 00:53:27,244
We are a family that
cares for each other.

897
00:53:27,771 --> 00:53:30,581
We love each other.
We conﬁde in each other.

898
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:33,184
The truth, fast, fast, okay?

899
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:34,988
So.
- Really I should tell pop?

900
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:36,482
Yes, really.

901
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:42,719
Really?

902
00:53:43,353 --> 00:53:44,354
Come here.

903
00:53:45,989 --> 00:53:47,730
Okay, I gotta go now. Bye.

904
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:50,603
He kissed ma?!

905
00:53:51,695 --> 00:53:53,572
Junior fell! Junior fell, uncle!

906
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:56,267
Junior fell!
Junior fell! Uncle, uncle"

907
00:53:56,299 --> 00:53:58,677
Whose junior fell?
- I'll go fetch water.

908
00:53:59,469 --> 00:54:02,109
Mario. Mario.

909
00:54:05,141 --> 00:54:06,950
Actually this is my fault.

910
00:54:07,210 --> 00:54:10,282
Because would you faint this
way if your mother were alive?

911
00:54:10,447 --> 00:54:11,357
Uncle, uncle.

912
00:54:11,381 --> 00:54:12,860
Tend to junior.
- Quiet!

913
00:54:13,016 --> 00:54:14,017
lam tending to him.

914
00:54:14,217 --> 00:54:15,252
"Tend to junior."

915
00:54:18,221 --> 00:54:19,791
Are you alright, Mario?
Are you okay?

916
00:54:19,823 --> 00:54:20,563
Yes.

917
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:22,433
He's okay. My son is okay.

918
00:54:24,394 --> 00:54:27,375
Mr car? Mr car?

919
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:29,608
Who cleaned my car?

920
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:30,767
Mark.

921
00:54:32,135 --> 00:54:33,136
Mark?

922
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:35,979
Oh mother Mary!

923
00:54:38,375 --> 00:54:39,683
What happened to uncle?

924
00:54:39,909 --> 00:54:41,752
It happens. It happens.

925
00:54:41,878 --> 00:54:43,084
Sprinkle water on him.
Sprinkle water.

926
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:53,897
'I have to tell
Soniyo my feelings.'

927
00:54:55,492 --> 00:54:56,493
'How I feel.'

928
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:58,969
'Before army return Vikram battle.'

929
00:55:01,498 --> 00:55:04,172
'Love you Soniyo. What say you?'

930
00:55:04,934 --> 00:55:06,936
H ey Mark!
Mark! Mark! Mark! Mark! Mark!

931
00:55:07,070 --> 00:55:09,050
Can't you see in the day now,
headlight?

932
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:10,846
Mark, I was coming
to you only, buddy.

933
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:12,885
Very important stuff, buddy.

934
00:55:12,942 --> 00:55:13,943
What now?

935
00:55:14,244 --> 00:55:19,216
I convinced Julie today
to go for a romantic evening.

936
00:55:19,549 --> 00:55:22,189
Sunset time.
On the rocks. Lovers point.

937
00:55:22,385 --> 00:55:24,456
So what do you want from ma?
You want the three of us to go?

938
00:55:24,688 --> 00:55:28,033
Io. Come pick me up after sunset.

939
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:30,035
You know at sundown I..

940
00:55:30,126 --> 00:55:31,662
I know.
- Yes.

941
00:55:32,228 --> 00:55:33,229
I'll come.

942
00:55:33,697 --> 00:55:34,971
You will come, won't you?
- Yes, I'll come. -Sure?

943
00:55:35,098 --> 00:55:35,769
You..!

944
00:55:35,799 --> 00:55:36,800
Friends?
- Friends.

945
00:55:36,966 --> 00:55:38,274
Thanks. See ya.
- Yes.

946
00:56:14,104 --> 00:56:16,641
Vikram's so cute, na?
Cute, na? Cute, na?

947
00:56:16,973 --> 00:56:18,475
Idiot! Stupid Vikram!

948
00:56:18,508 --> 00:56:20,044
Idiot Vikram! Take this, Vikram!

949
00:56:21,244 --> 00:56:22,245
Mark!

950
00:56:24,314 --> 00:56:25,315
Mark!

951
00:56:25,448 --> 00:56:26,392
Oh shit!

952
00:56:26,416 --> 00:56:27,793
Come on out, scoundrel!

953
00:56:29,519 --> 00:56:30,520
Come out!

954
00:56:31,688 --> 00:56:32,860
A blemish on friendship!

955
00:56:32,956 --> 00:56:34,026
Why are you yelling?

956
00:56:34,958 --> 00:56:36,403
Why didn't you come to pick me up?

957
00:56:36,793 --> 00:56:39,899
Oh my.. Shit! It slipped my mind.

958
00:56:39,929 --> 00:56:40,532
Sorry.

959
00:56:40,563 --> 00:56:41,940
It slipped your mind?

960
00:56:42,031 --> 00:56:45,240
Watch what else I
make you slip on now.

961
00:56:46,703 --> 00:56:47,704
What are you doing?

962
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:50,573
Careful.

963
00:56:51,941 --> 00:56:52,942
What is this?

964
00:56:52,976 --> 00:56:55,217
That scared you, didn't it?

965
00:56:55,445 --> 00:56:58,483
I wouldn't be here if I was scared.

966
00:57:01,284 --> 00:57:02,262
Where are you?

967
00:57:02,285 --> 00:57:03,923
Stand in one place.
I want to hit you.

968
00:57:04,554 --> 00:57:05,931
Headlight!
Hold the scoundrel!

969
00:57:06,055 --> 00:57:06,931
Headlight!

970
00:57:06,990 --> 00:57:07,866
Hold it, hold it!

971
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:09,096
Are you going to kill him?

972
00:57:09,225 --> 00:57:11,865
Hold it, hold it.
- Let it go!

973
00:57:13,396 --> 00:57:15,171
Low look, I'm really sorry, man.

974
00:57:15,331 --> 00:57:18,175
Shut up, man! Do you
know how much I was insulted?

975
00:57:18,535 --> 00:57:21,345
Julie slapped me red.
One the cheeks.

976
00:57:21,738 --> 00:57:25,185
Then the police slapped me red.
All over, man.

977
00:57:25,208 --> 00:57:26,687
Nothing is over.

978
00:57:26,976 --> 00:57:28,580
I was beaten all over.

979
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:31,425
Sorry. Let it go now.

980
00:57:31,748 --> 00:57:33,386
Veer has invited us to a party.

981
00:57:34,651 --> 00:57:37,564
Many beautiful babes will attend.

982
00:57:38,521 --> 00:57:41,127
Even an aunty will do.
I can't see anyway.

983
00:57:41,758 --> 00:57:43,760
But let me know if
anyone ﬂirts with me.

984
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:45,539
For sure. Come.
- Come.

985
00:57:45,628 --> 00:57:46,629
Let's go.

986
00:57:47,530 --> 00:57:54,539
"Whoa, my darling.
You are my wine."

987
00:57:54,571 --> 00:57:56,244
"You are divine."

988
00:57:56,339 --> 00:58:00,014
Yes, Marky goes anywhere
he gets free food.

989
00:58:00,210 --> 00:58:00,950
Yes.

990
00:58:00,977 --> 00:58:02,581
"Pretty baby, will you love ma?"

991
00:58:02,812 --> 00:58:05,622
Exactly who is being watched?

992
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:09,494
The glass in your hand
or the alcohol inside."

993
00:58:09,886 --> 00:58:11,866
Or the one standing next to..

994
00:58:12,689 --> 00:58:14,327
Standing? Who is it?

995
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:15,162
Who is standing?

996
00:58:15,191 --> 00:58:17,171
Nobody. Mark is drunk.

997
00:58:17,427 --> 00:58:18,337
I see.

998
00:58:18,361 --> 00:58:19,362
Take a sip.

999
00:58:19,863 --> 00:58:22,070
Break your silence and
tell me what you thinking.

1000
00:58:22,098 --> 00:58:23,099
That's right, buddy.

1001
00:58:23,199 --> 00:58:28,410
Actually I was thinking
this music is very boring.

1002
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:29,741
That's right.

1003
00:58:29,973 --> 00:58:30,974
Veer, come here!

1004
00:58:32,642 --> 00:58:33,643
Come.

1005
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:34,947
What's the matter?
- Bro.

1006
00:58:35,478 --> 00:58:36,582
Please don't mind..
- What?

1007
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:38,860
"but what son of music
are you playing at the party?

1008
00:58:38,948 --> 00:58:41,224
That's right.
- Let's have some peppy music.

1009
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:42,193
That's right.

1010
00:58:42,218 --> 00:58:43,458
So why don't you sing?

1011
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:44,698
You want me to sing?

1012
00:58:44,721 --> 00:58:47,224
Why not? I'll sing.
- Good idea. -Yes.

1013
00:58:47,257 --> 00:58:48,702
You're going to sing a song, Marky?

1014
00:58:48,725 --> 00:58:50,466
Yes, I'll sing.
- You are my buddy!

1015
00:58:51,928 --> 00:58:53,464
Look, Vikram is over there.
Let me introduce you.

1016
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:55,041
Let's go meet him.
- Yes, let's go. Come, come, come.

1017
00:58:56,132 --> 00:58:57,873
Oh no.
- That is all.

1018
00:58:59,035 --> 00:59:00,742
Brother, these are my
good friends from childhood.

1019
00:59:00,904 --> 00:59:03,578
Mark, Bablu, headlight.
Do you remember?

1020
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:05,048
Of course, I remember. Hello.

1021
00:59:05,275 --> 00:59:06,276
How are you gulls?

1022
00:59:06,442 --> 00:59:09,116
Thank god you guys are out
of your shorts and in trousers.

1023
00:59:10,013 --> 00:59:12,220
I hope you guys are having fun.
- Yeah, yeah. Absolutely.

1024
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:16,390
My friends are complaining
this is very boring music.

1025
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:19,859
They wish to sing a song
that would get the party going.

1026
00:59:20,089 --> 00:59:22,194
Fantastic! Thank god!

1027
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:24,068
Even I was bloody getting
bored of this music.

1028
00:59:24,527 --> 00:59:26,200
Hold on. Ladies and gentlemen.

1029
00:59:26,829 --> 00:59:29,867
And now presenting some new
entertainment for this evening.

1030
00:59:30,466 --> 00:59:32,912
Mark Braganza and
the childhood buddies.

1031
00:59:34,370 --> 00:59:35,371
Thank you. Thank you.

1032
00:59:36,272 --> 00:59:37,808
Let's go have a peg. Come.

1033
00:59:38,441 --> 00:59:39,749
Oh sure. Why not?
- Thanks.

1034
00:59:48,718 --> 00:59:55,101
"Your love blended with me."

1035
00:59:57,126 --> 01:00:03,566
"Surviving without you gets
tougher with each passing day."

1036
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:09,045
"I don't know how
love came on my heart."

1037
01:00:09,472 --> 01:00:12,942
"I don't know how
it landed so softly."

1038
01:00:13,743 --> 01:00:22,322
"Neither you nor I know how
it made a niche in our hearts."

1039
01:00:40,069 --> 01:00:44,040
"Just got the feeling
that you just can't say no."

1040
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:47,978
"Thought about it claps no more."

1041
01:00:48,711 --> 01:00:53,023
"We'll be the next to see,
this is reality."

1042
01:00:53,549 --> 01:00:56,530
"Feel like I'm dreaming"

1043
01:00:56,586 --> 01:01:04,471
"Love was the only
thing she heard aloud."

1044
01:01:05,194 --> 01:01:13,238
"And I believed what people said."

1045
01:01:13,803 --> 01:01:21,813
"I learnt the existence
of love after meeting you."

1046
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:30,491
"I'd heard and seen
every form of love."

1047
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:37,567
"I ow my heart is
completely besotted."

1048
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:19,742
"if you say yes,
it would clinch the deal."

1049
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:28,147
"Life would be wonderful
if I had your hand."

1050
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:36,827
"You appear the nicest
and most honest to me."

1051
01:02:37,453 --> 01:02:45,167
"You are close to me
even when you aren't around."

1052
01:02:45,862 --> 01:02:52,575
"I ow my heart is
completely besotted."

1053
01:03:10,086 --> 01:03:14,091
"Just got the feeling
that you just can't say no."

1054
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:18,132
"Thought about it claps no more."

1055
01:03:18,394 --> 01:03:21,136
Meenu said your engagement
will be discussed today.

1056
01:03:21,597 --> 01:03:22,632
Good thing.

1057
01:03:22,832 --> 01:03:24,869
Quick engagement
and quick nuptials.

1058
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:28,180
You'll have it made.

1059
01:03:29,005 --> 01:03:31,110
Vikram is a very smart guy.

1060
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:38,557
What's the matter, Soniyo?
- Huh?

1061
01:03:38,781 --> 01:03:40,089
You don't seem happy?

1062
01:03:40,550 --> 01:03:43,292
l? Nothing is the matter to ma?
I'm good.

1063
01:03:43,619 --> 01:03:46,429
You liar! Your face is pale.

1064
01:03:46,856 --> 01:03:47,994
What's the matter?

1065
01:03:50,927 --> 01:03:55,467
Tell me the truth.
Do you or don't you like Vikram?

1066
01:03:56,165 --> 01:03:57,405
It's not that.

1067
01:03:57,767 --> 01:03:59,713
Just that everything
is moving so fast.

1068
01:03:59,936 --> 01:04:01,381
...I haven't had the time to think.

1069
01:04:04,073 --> 01:04:06,383
Why don't you tell
that to your father?

1070
01:04:07,009 --> 01:04:08,113
He wouldn't understand.

1071
01:04:08,878 --> 01:04:09,879
He will.

1072
01:04:09,979 --> 01:04:13,483
He will surely understand, Soniyo.
Speak to him.

1073
01:04:13,883 --> 01:04:16,090
You could ask him for
a little time if nothing more.

1074
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:17,687
To think.

1075
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:20,396
I don't know why I am confused.

1076
01:04:25,628 --> 01:04:26,629
Get go!

1077
01:04:26,829 --> 01:04:27,830
He's crazy.

1078
01:04:30,967 --> 01:04:31,968
Soniyo.

1079
01:04:33,302 --> 01:04:34,303
What?

1080
01:04:37,139 --> 01:04:39,244
I'll be back in ajiffy.

1081
01:04:39,308 --> 01:04:42,619
Soniyo, you're sitting here.
- Yes.

1082
01:04:42,945 --> 01:04:44,356
Everyone is waiting
for you upstairs.

1083
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:46,321
Come along. Come with me.
- Yes.

1084
01:04:58,995 --> 01:05:04,308
Friends, there are two
reasons for today's celebration.

1085
01:05:05,434 --> 01:05:09,075
The ﬁrst reason,
my son Vikram has returned"

1086
01:05:09,605 --> 01:05:11,448
..from the army as a captain.

1087
01:05:12,241 --> 01:05:15,279
And the second and
more important reason"

1088
01:05:15,478 --> 01:05:18,391
...I am getting my
son Vikram engaged..

1089
01:05:19,181 --> 01:05:22,253
..to my friend Tejinder
Singh's daughter Soniyo.

1090
01:05:22,318 --> 01:05:23,319
Papal

1091
01:05:24,287 --> 01:05:27,427
Our friendship will turn
into a relationship from now on.

1092
01:05:27,556 --> 01:05:30,298
Hold on, Bali,
let me speak as well, buddy?

1093
01:05:31,294 --> 01:05:33,740
Listen to me, dad.
- Just a minute, my dear.

1094
01:05:34,764 --> 01:05:35,504
Friends"

1095
01:05:35,564 --> 01:05:37,908
I have to discuss very important with dad.
-The function we will host next..

1096
01:05:37,967 --> 01:05:40,811
Listen, what your dad has to say.
- "will be grander than this.

1097
01:05:40,970 --> 01:05:44,110
Because very soon

1098
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:47,580
"Will be joined in
holy matrimony with Vikram.

1099

1100
01:06:40,562 --> 01:06:41,199

1101
01:06:41,262 --> 01:06:43,003

1102

ll-

1103
01:06:45,700 --> 01:06:47,407

1104
01:06:47,669 --> 01:06:48,773
I want to talk to you.

1105
01:06:48,836 --> 01:06:49,837

1106
01:06:50,305 --> 01:06:51,249

What you are doing with your life?

1112
01:07:04,218 --> 01:07:05,288
What do you mean?

1113
01:07:05,453 --> 01:07:06,830
Do you love Vikram?

1114
01:07:09,223 --> 01:07:09,928
It's different.

1115
01:07:09,958 --> 01:07:11,494
Soniyo, Do you know him?

1116
01:07:13,261 --> 01:07:15,207
I love you, I love you.

1117
01:07:18,766 --> 01:07:23,112
College's dance rehearsals, connection
between you and me, I mean..

01:07:23,371 --> 01:07:24,611

You don't like ma?

1123
01:07:41,055 --> 01:07:43,865
Of course I like you,
but just like a friend.

1124
01:07:44,592 --> 01:07:47,368
And Vikram is better
because he is Punjabi, right?

1125
01:07:47,895 --> 01:07:54,278
Io, because he is my dad's
choice and I am ok with him.

1126
01:07:54,602 --> 01:07:56,843
Because I am a very simple girl..

1127
01:07:57,238 --> 01:08:01,015
..and I want my life
simple and no complications.

1128
01:08:03,044 --> 01:08:04,022

He should be the boss.

1317
01:21:11,865 --> 01:21:13,367

Thank you Kutty for the lift!

1352

Why you are thanking him?

1353
01:22:57,838 --> 01:23:00,819
This milestone says that
we are near the Granny's home.

1354
01:23:01,642 --> 01:23:03,451
0k, but we have to go to camp.

a short distance to granny's home..

..and other is a far
away which goes to camp"

1357
01:23:10,784 --> 01:23:14,630
..now you decide that you want to go
to granny house to join the party"

1358
01:23:14,922 --> 01:23:18,369
..or in this dangerous
road in this dark night?

1359
01:23:19,426 --> 01:23:23,932
Io, I am frightened, I think
we should go to granny home.

1360
01:23:23,964 --> 01:23:24,965
Yes.

1361
01:23:25,933 --> 01:23:29,312
But what I was thinking that How
your family will react seeing ma?

1362
01:23:29,503 --> 01:23:32,279
You don't worry about them, those
guys are dam broadminded, really.

Hey, at last he came no?
Then why to bother him?

Oh no. - She is not my girlfriend.

1375
01:24:16,283 --> 01:24:17,853
I am not that drunk that..

1376
01:24:17,951 --> 01:24:20,989
I cannot understand the difference
between girlfriend and boyfriend.

1377
01:24:21,288 --> 01:24:24,098

Yo, Soniyo, wonderful.

God bless you my child,

1387
01:24:52,185 --> 01:24:53,186
A phone call.

1388
01:24:57,658 --> 01:24:58,728
Hello?

1389
01:25:02,629 --> 01:25:03,630
What?

1390
01:25:05,565 --> 01:25:06,737
But how it happened?

1391
01:25:08,168 --> 01:25:09,647
You are telling me this now?

1392
01:25:10,904 --> 01:25:13,441
Isn't there anything
like responsibility?

1393
01:25:14,675 --> 01:25:16,882
You denied the children
to carry the mobile with them.

1394
01:25:18,045 --> 01:25:19,319
What no network zone?

1395
01:25:23,784 --> 01:25:24,785
Kutty?

1396
01:25:28,422 --> 01:25:29,457

1397
01:25:32,225 --> 01:25:33,226

1401
01:25:46,973 --> 01:25:47,974
What?

1402
01:25:48,975 --> 01:25:51,012
Hello, hello?

1403
01:25:53,680 --> 01:25:55,182
Disconnected,
I think they don't have money.

1404
01:25:55,282 --> 01:25:56,283
Who's money ﬁnished?

1405
01:25:56,450 --> 01:25:58,452
I think they were at phone booth.

1406
01:25:58,752 --> 01:26:00,356
Where is Soniyo?

1407
01:26:00,554 --> 01:26:04,559
I don't know,

they may be together"

01:26:15,268 --> 01:26:17,043
God help them.

1413
01:26:22,809 --> 01:26:30,125
"I don't know how does
love touched my heart."

1414
01:26:30,250 --> 01:26:36,064
"Don't know how love stepped
lightly on the earth of my heart"

1415
01:26:37,691 --> 01:26:43,733
"it has made a home
in our heart in such a way."

1416
01:26:44,931 --> 01:26:49,971
"That neither of us got to know."

"than abstract glass is produced.

1480
01:31:35,255 --> 01:31:36,962
What you have to
do is to take it out.

This lightening, which makes
beautiful glasses, killed my mom.

01:32:26,739 --> 01:32:28,946
Mark, I am so sorry.

1491
01:32:31,077 --> 01:32:35,685
I was small at that time, so they did
not show me my mom for last time.

1492
01:32:38,118 --> 01:32:41,292
Same time the lightening
struck that evening..

1493
01:32:42,689 --> 01:32:45,727

01:32:48,027 --> 01:32:49,472

1581
01:38:23,930 --> 01:38:25,238
Mark my words.

1582
01:38:25,798 --> 01:38:28,005
You are a pan of my family.

1583
01:38:28,835 --> 01:38:30,337
Okay. I love you so much.

1584
01:38:30,436 --> 01:38:31,312
God bless you.

1585
01:38:31,337 --> 01:38:32,816
. Bye, bye...

1586
01:38:32,939 --> 01:38:35,078

Bye!
- Bye, bye...

1588
01:38:36,843 --> 01:38:37,844
Bye.

1589
01:38:49,922 --> 01:38:56,635
"Know not what has come
over me after meeting you"

1590
01:38:57,697 --> 01:39:03,909
"I'm getting lost in you"

1591
01:39:05,171 --> 01:39:11,952
"There is something
which is left unsaid"

1592
01:39:12,979 --> 01:39:18,952
"ll either you nor I know"

1593
01:39:39,272 --> 01:39:40,273
Mark.

1594
01:39:42,875 --> 01:39:43,819
Mark.

1595
01:39:43,843 --> 01:39:44,844
Yes.

1596
01:39:49,248 --> 01:39:50,192
I am in love.

1597
01:39:51,517 --> 01:39:52,791
I know.

1598
01:39:53,185 --> 01:39:58,294
It's with this soil, with sky
and with granny.

1599
01:39:58,457 --> 01:39:59,902
Io, Mark.

1600
01:40:02,795 --> 01:40:03,796
With you.

1601
01:40:10,937 --> 01:40:11,938
What?

1602
01:40:14,974 --> 01:40:16,009
I love you, Mark.

1603
01:40:18,945 --> 01:40:20,356
I don't believe this.

1604
01:40:22,315 --> 01:40:23,589
Am I hearing right?

1605
01:40:26,452 --> 01:40:27,863
Or is it some dream?

1606
01:40:29,789 --> 01:40:31,097
Just pinch me. Pinch.

1607
01:40:34,093 --> 01:40:36,198
Oh, no! I believe you.

1608
01:40:40,132 --> 01:40:41,372
I love you too, Soniyo.

1609
01:40:45,137 --> 01:40:46,138
Oh.

1610
01:40:46,906 --> 01:40:50,115
But we can't tell our families.
Io one would understand.

1611
01:40:52,678 --> 01:40:53,679
Don't worry.

1612
01:40:54,580 --> 01:41:00,030
I'll plan something that
your family would agree.

1613
01:41:00,620 --> 01:41:01,621
Okay?

1614
01:41:02,154 --> 01:41:03,155
<i>0K3‘!-</i>

1615
01:41:04,056 --> 01:41:05,057
All right.

1616
01:41:12,164 --> 01:41:13,837
Found out?
- 0k, we've to go that side.

1617
01:41:14,300 --> 01:41:17,304
There's Soniyo! Hurry up.
Listen up.

1618
01:41:18,237 --> 01:41:19,648
Mark! Soniyo!

1619
01:41:19,739 --> 01:41:21,878
How did you escaped from
that bloody gang of Kutty?

1620
01:41:22,041 --> 01:41:23,748
Sir, she'll explain.
- Yeah.

1621
01:41:24,577 --> 01:41:28,491
Actually when I went to see
that place, than there...

1622
01:41:51,404 --> 01:41:52,678
C'mon Soniyo!

1623
01:41:54,440 --> 01:41:56,078
I was not at fault too, dad.

1624
01:41:56,375 --> 01:41:59,982
And, the way you think
it's nothing of that kind.

1625
01:42:00,446 --> 01:42:03,655
Then what were you two doing
alone in the camps alone.

1626
01:42:04,650 --> 01:42:05,924
Waiting for the oldie?

1627
01:42:06,719 --> 01:42:10,792
Actually... I had gone to take
some photos with my camera.

1628
01:42:11,657 --> 01:42:15,298
And Mark was there to collect
some wood for bonﬁre..

1629
01:42:15,728 --> 01:42:18,265
..he started to talk about
his glass pieces.

1630
01:42:18,531 --> 01:42:21,307
Glass pieces?
Hey, what's that?

1631
01:42:21,867 --> 01:42:24,143
Brother, it's Mark's hobby.

1632
01:42:24,370 --> 01:42:26,714
He makes hand toned glass pieces.

1633
01:42:26,939 --> 01:42:29,010
And he had to exhibit that.

1634
01:42:29,341 --> 01:42:33,414
So... He asked me to talk
about it with dad.

1635
01:42:35,214 --> 01:42:37,558
All these years, before this"

1636
01:42:37,917 --> 01:42:42,423
..We.. I and Mark were not even
on hello, hi, terms.

1637
01:42:49,662 --> 01:42:54,907
Just, while dancing, we developed
a friend type rapport.

1638
01:42:56,502 --> 01:42:59,972
Listen dear, I feel that
Soniyo is not a fault at all.

1639
01:43:00,139 --> 01:43:02,415
Look, how scared she looks,
my dear child.

1640
01:43:02,708 --> 01:43:04,346
You keep quiet.
Don't interfere.

1641
01:43:04,944 --> 01:43:05,945
Then?

1642
01:43:06,746 --> 01:43:13,493
And then... I saw a wolf...
a wild dog is staring us.

1643
01:43:14,286 --> 01:43:15,993
I was just paralyzed.

1644
01:43:16,222 --> 01:43:19,760
But the wolf or the dog
whatever it was came towards us..

1645
01:43:19,792 --> 01:43:20,463
Oh God!

1646
01:43:20,493 --> 01:43:22,063
And than Mark came and saved me.

1647
01:43:22,561 --> 01:43:23,835
And we climbed up the tree.

1648
01:43:24,363 --> 01:43:27,105
And when climbed down, we
fell in the hands of Kutti Karan.

1649
01:43:29,468 --> 01:43:30,469
<i>0K3‘!-</i>

1650
01:43:32,104 --> 01:43:33,105
You go sleep.

1651
01:43:33,405 --> 01:43:34,406
Yes.

1652
01:43:34,907 --> 01:43:36,853
Hey, handover your mobile
than go.

1653
01:43:36,942 --> 01:43:37,716
What?

1654
01:43:37,743 --> 01:43:39,222
Give it.
-Take the mobile.

1655
01:43:41,981 --> 01:43:43,688
You check her messages.

1656
01:43:51,590 --> 01:43:52,625
This Mark too is...

1657
01:43:56,228 --> 01:43:58,799
I should meet Mark and
clear everything.

1658
01:44:29,728 --> 01:44:30,729
Soniyo?

1659
01:44:31,564 --> 01:44:32,565
Vikram!

1660
01:44:32,731 --> 01:44:33,801
What do I do now?

1661
01:44:35,167 --> 01:44:37,943
Hey, good that you met.
I was coming to see you.

1662
01:44:42,708 --> 01:44:44,381
Meet ma? Really?

1663
01:44:44,944 --> 01:44:45,820
Yes.

1664
01:44:45,845 --> 01:44:48,951
If you have any misunderstanding
or doubt, to clear that.

1665
01:44:50,616 --> 01:44:51,594
Look.

1666
01:44:51,617 --> 01:44:53,494
If there was something
between Mark and me..

1667
01:44:53,686 --> 01:44:55,688
"than why'd I have got
engaged with you?

1668
01:44:56,255 --> 01:44:58,929
Also everyone is aware
that Mark is a good boy.

1669
01:44:59,425 --> 01:45:01,701
And now days who
believes in cast and creed.

1670
01:45:02,494 --> 01:45:04,804
Dad too understands this.

1671
01:45:05,397 --> 01:45:08,901
So you know, I felt that
you deserve an explanation.

1672
01:45:10,069 --> 01:45:11,070
Of course.

1673
01:45:11,103 --> 01:45:14,312
We are to be married so
I deserve, don't l?

1674
01:45:14,607 --> 01:45:17,349
But, don't tell this at home,
please.

1675
01:45:17,810 --> 01:45:21,223
Otherwise what would they feel
that I came to see you so late.

1676
01:45:21,513 --> 01:45:24,084
Oh, sure, sure, sure. Something
that's juse between you and me.

1677
01:45:24,116 --> 01:45:24,856
Yeah.

1678
01:45:24,884 --> 01:45:26,386
Come I'll drop you home.

1679
01:45:26,418 --> 01:45:28,420
Io, it's close by.
I will go.

1680
01:45:29,488 --> 01:45:30,558
Okay. - Yeah

1681
01:45:30,756 --> 01:45:32,235
Good night.
- Good night. Thanks.

1682
01:45:55,848 --> 01:45:56,849
Soniyo.

1683
01:45:58,050 --> 01:45:59,051
Soniyo!

1684
01:46:00,119 --> 01:46:01,120
Soniyo!

1685
01:46:15,167 --> 01:46:16,168
Who's it?

1686
01:46:18,237 --> 01:46:19,045
Oh no.

1687
01:46:19,104 --> 01:46:20,879
You too go and see.
- Yes, dad.

1688
01:46:23,275 --> 01:46:24,879
Who is it? Oh, you!

1689
01:46:25,177 --> 01:46:26,178
Come.

1690
01:46:29,415 --> 01:46:31,622
Hey, you came to meet
Soniyo on the sly? - Io, no.

1691
01:46:31,784 --> 01:46:34,264
Actually I came to see you guys.
Mother's swear.

1692
01:46:34,853 --> 01:46:38,266
Just to clear any doubts between
me and Soniyo.

1693
01:46:38,457 --> 01:46:40,334
Just a minute. A Minute.
- Okay.

1694
01:46:40,893 --> 01:46:42,895
Soniyo told us what has happened.

1695
01:46:43,495 --> 01:46:45,600
Io you say it. Speak.

1696
01:46:46,098 --> 01:46:49,170
So that I can match whether
your stories tally.

1697
01:46:49,401 --> 01:46:50,471
Go call Soniyo.

1698
01:46:55,507 --> 01:46:57,509
Soniyo! Soniyo?

1699
01:46:58,177 --> 01:46:59,520
Soniyo!

1700
01:47:01,647 --> 01:47:02,682
Dad!

1701
01:47:03,482 --> 01:47:05,985
Dad, Soniyo is not there.

1702
01:47:06,819 --> 01:47:07,820
God!

1703
01:47:08,053 --> 01:47:11,500
As it is people were pointing
ﬁngers, and now she's disappeared!

1704
01:47:11,824 --> 01:47:12,894
We are damned.

1705
01:47:13,492 --> 01:47:15,199
Oh, oh!
- What'll happen now?

1706
01:47:15,594 --> 01:47:18,803
Pummy, Pummy, don't take
tension. Be cool.

1707
01:47:18,964 --> 01:47:21,137
Tell me the truth, do you have
any hand in this?

1708
01:47:21,333 --> 01:47:24,473
Come on, bro. lot only hand
check nose, ears and tongue too.

1709
01:47:28,607 --> 01:47:29,608
Come here!

1710
01:47:31,643 --> 01:47:32,644
Stop there!

1711
01:47:36,415 --> 01:47:37,416
Come here.

1712
01:47:43,655 --> 01:47:44,656
Dad...

1713
01:47:44,823 --> 01:47:45,893
Where were you?

1714
01:47:46,191 --> 01:47:47,534
That... I...

1715
01:47:48,927 --> 01:47:50,736
Vikram... he had called me.

1716
01:47:50,996 --> 01:47:53,704
Vikram? - Asked to come
without informing anyone.

1717
01:47:53,932 --> 01:47:54,933
Why?

1718
01:47:56,301 --> 01:47:57,575
He had few questions.

1719
01:47:57,936 --> 01:48:03,352
And... He did not want that
anyone of you inﬂuence my answers.

1720
01:48:03,542 --> 01:48:04,543
wow,

1721
01:48:05,611 --> 01:48:09,354
Do these fools think that
we tutor our daughter?

1722
01:48:09,548 --> 01:48:10,720
Io, dad...
- You listen...

1723
01:48:10,916 --> 01:48:13,453
You aren't sent off yet.
You still are from this house.

1724
01:48:13,886 --> 01:48:15,627
And stop siding them.

1725
01:48:16,255 --> 01:48:19,759
Brother, not all of them.
This was only Vikram's plan.

1726
01:48:20,092 --> 01:48:22,868
See dad. They have started
to teach planning to the girl.

1727
01:48:23,762 --> 01:48:27,335
Why not.
He's an army returned.

1728
01:48:28,434 --> 01:48:30,471
So his mouth has opened
a big wider.

1729
01:48:31,437 --> 01:48:32,643
I'll talk to him.

1730
01:48:33,005 --> 01:48:35,611
Dad, please.
At least you be cool.

1731
01:48:36,408 --> 01:48:39,855
Vikram is hot minded.
God knows what he might do.

1732
01:48:40,679 --> 01:48:42,989
It'd be nothing to you.
You well send me there..

1733
01:48:43,949 --> 01:48:46,759
"but it's me who will have
to spend my life with them.

1734
01:48:47,152 --> 01:48:48,153
Saw?

1735
01:48:48,687 --> 01:48:50,564
How matured my Soniyo has become!

1736
01:48:51,190 --> 01:48:52,362
She is right, dear.

1737
01:48:52,458 --> 01:48:55,667
Look, don't mention anything
to them about this.

1738
01:48:56,428 --> 01:48:58,032
That's right, but...

1739
01:48:59,031 --> 01:49:02,274
Vikram, without informing
both the families.

1740
01:49:02,901 --> 01:49:06,007
..is not right asking questions
to Soniyo like this.

1741
01:49:06,605 --> 01:49:08,312
Uncle, he must have made mistake.

1742
01:49:08,607 --> 01:49:09,677
Actually I too thought.

1743
01:49:09,741 --> 01:49:12,654
..that I should meet Soniyo in the
college and sort the matter out.

1744
01:49:13,312 --> 01:49:16,521
But than I felt, elders of the
family must be informed ﬁrst.

1745
01:49:16,815 --> 01:49:19,352
..so that there is no doubts
or misunderstanding in future.

1746
01:49:19,918 --> 01:49:20,919
Isn't it, uncle?

1747
01:49:22,321 --> 01:49:23,425
You did right.

1748
01:49:25,057 --> 01:49:27,367
The amount of garbage
you kids scatter"

1749
01:49:27,626 --> 01:49:31,597
"cleaning of that can only
be done by we elders.

1750
01:49:31,763 --> 01:49:32,764
Of course. Of course.

1751
01:49:32,998 --> 01:49:36,639
Low let it be, Bunnu.
What had to happen, happened.

1752
01:49:36,969 --> 01:49:40,712
It was good that Mark was
with Soniyo so our child survived.

1753
01:49:41,173 --> 01:49:44,245
If she was kidnapped alone, and

As of today, there shouldn't
be any dance.

1866

01:59:33,832 --> 01:59:36,403
She said Soniyo reached
home half an hour ago.

1889
01:59:37,135 --> 01:59:38,546

saw Soniyo. She is dancing there.

01:59:46,811 --> 01:59:50,349
But son...

1894

02:02:01,045 --> 02:02:02,046
God bless you.

1929
02:02:03,248 --> 02:02:04,249
Okay, son.

1930
02:02:08,920 --> 02:02:10,991
Low tell me what happened?

1931
02:02:11,589 --> 02:02:12,932
What's there to tell.

1932
02:02:13,791 --> 02:02:18,262
Your to be son-in-law has
gone senile in his youth.

1933
02:02:19,631 --> 02:02:20,632
God!

1934
02:02:21,132 --> 02:02:23,339
Low I am worried about my Soniyo.

1935
02:02:29,173 --> 02:02:31,517
Bro, are you going
to Ofﬁceﬂs Club?

1936
02:02:32,443 --> 02:02:34,013
Drop me to mid way.

1937
02:02:34,646 --> 02:02:35,681
Where are you going?

1938
02:02:35,780 --> 02:02:36,952
Just at Mark's house.

1939
02:02:39,651 --> 02:02:40,721
What?

1940
02:02:42,654 --> 02:02:46,329
What can one expect from others
when one's own coin is bad.

1941
02:02:46,457 --> 02:02:47,458
Brother".

1942
02:02:47,859 --> 02:02:50,703
..as it is melodramatic serials
are in overdose at home"

1943
02:02:51,129 --> 02:02:52,540
..and now you too don't start.

1944
02:02:57,135 --> 02:02:58,409
0k, tell me something.

1945
02:02:59,904 --> 02:03:01,975
Does Mark says
anything about Soniyo?

1946
02:03:03,841 --> 02:03:06,378
Bro, even if he has something
in his heart.

1947
02:03:06,678 --> 02:03:09,181
..why would he say it
in front of me? Common sense.

1948
02:03:10,949 --> 02:03:12,292
Come. I will drop you.

1949
02:03:15,086 --> 02:03:16,463
Soniyo! - Yes.

1950
02:03:16,988 --> 02:03:18,865
The boy is indeed talented.

1951
02:03:20,458 --> 02:03:22,369
Handloom graphics are
much in demand.

1952
02:03:22,694 --> 02:03:25,106
In big hotels and big people.
Isn't it, dad?

1953
02:03:25,496 --> 02:03:26,839
Yes, of course.

1954
02:03:27,332 --> 02:03:30,905
I will do this, all the real estate
customers which I have..

1955
02:03:31,002 --> 02:03:32,913
...I will invite all of them
to the exhibition.

1956
02:03:33,237 --> 02:03:34,978
And of course exhibition
will be a success.

1957
02:03:35,106 --> 02:03:37,882
..when there will be hot tea
and hot dumplings.

1958
02:03:40,178 --> 02:03:41,122
Just tea?

1959
02:03:41,145 --> 02:03:42,146
Why, should I make it coffee?

1960
02:03:43,348 --> 02:03:44,793
Hey, go ahead say the rest.

1961
02:03:45,149 --> 02:03:49,256
Actually, uncle... I was thinking
more like... wine and cheese-

1962
02:03:51,756 --> 02:03:53,793
Budget will slightly increase.

1963
02:03:54,025 --> 02:03:58,770
But now days in posh places
it's wine and cheese which rules.

1964
02:03:59,030 --> 02:04:01,067
And these elite don't eat
samosas etc. now a days.

1965
02:04:01,165 --> 02:04:03,907
Last time too you distributed
all the Samosas among relatives.

1966
02:04:04,002 --> 02:04:04,810
Do you remember?

1967
02:04:04,836 --> 02:04:05,837
Brilliant point.

1968
02:04:05,903 --> 02:04:08,144
Fine, than we'll this"

1969
02:04:08,573 --> 02:04:11,452
...along with wine we'll keep
cheese dumplings.

1970
02:04:12,310 --> 02:04:13,380
Why not!

1971
02:04:29,627 --> 02:04:30,628
What?

1972
02:04:31,696 --> 02:04:33,767
Good that I came to drop you here.

1973
02:04:41,072 --> 02:04:42,210
Bye, bro.

1974
02:04:44,575 --> 02:04:45,053
Bye.

1975
02:04:45,076 --> 02:04:47,113
0k, Mark. I will make a move.

1976
02:04:47,712 --> 02:04:49,555
Take care. - Okay.

1977
02:04:53,951 --> 02:04:55,055
Oh! - Hi, bro.

1978
02:05:01,893 --> 02:05:04,635
In this condition, will it be right
for you to go to Mark's exhibition?

1979
02:05:05,696 --> 02:05:07,198
So, should I keep mourning?

1980
02:05:07,999 --> 02:05:10,001
There is no logic for anything
in this house, man.

1981
02:05:12,370 --> 02:05:13,713
Mark is my best friend.

1982
02:05:14,939 --> 02:05:16,509
You are hiding something, isn't it?

1983
02:05:16,841 --> 02:05:18,081
Why are you thinking so?

1984
02:05:18,709 --> 02:05:22,316
Look, if you know something,
tell us.

1985
02:05:22,780 --> 02:05:24,157
It's only a...

1986
02:05:24,382 --> 02:05:26,020
Soniyo is also my friend.

1987
02:05:26,717 --> 02:05:29,960
And that's I have this feeling...
there is something cooking.

1988
02:05:32,223 --> 02:05:33,327
I feel, marriage"

1989
02:05:35,026 --> 02:05:36,869
..is a bond of love.

1990
02:05:37,595 --> 02:05:40,007
In which application of force
isn't good.

1991
02:05:40,698 --> 02:05:43,008
But this alliance is ﬁnalized
with Soniyo's consent, isn't it?

1992
02:05:43,534 --> 02:05:45,207
Then what force?

1993
02:05:46,204 --> 02:05:48,582
Who did ever consulted
the poor girl.

1994
02:05:49,107 --> 02:05:51,815
She was just informed that
she is getting married to Vikram.

1995
02:05:52,009 --> 02:05:53,989
Of course she could have
then informed everyone.

1996
02:05:54,112 --> 02:05:55,614
At least to her family?

1997
02:05:56,180 --> 02:05:58,353
Even today India is full of
all types of families.

1998
02:05:58,583 --> 02:05:59,891
Few are very modern"

1999
02:06:00,118 --> 02:06:01,722
..and a few are still traditional.

2000
02:06:02,587 --> 02:06:05,830
And all the children
try their hard..

2001
02:06:06,190 --> 02:06:09,899
..that they do not hurt their
family's beliefs and culture.

2002
02:06:11,229 --> 02:06:12,401
Isn't it Mitesh?

2003
02:06:12,597 --> 02:06:13,871
Well, I don't know what to say.

2004
02:06:15,166 --> 02:06:17,806
As it is, take example of you both.

2005
02:06:18,936 --> 02:06:21,507
Mitesh and you meet
at Mintu's wedding"

2006
02:06:22,273 --> 02:06:23,911
..and both of you fall in love.

2007
02:06:25,376 --> 02:06:28,414
But you conﬁde this love
before the families...

2008
02:06:29,213 --> 02:06:30,214
ll o way.

2009
02:06:32,116 --> 02:06:33,993
And than Mitesh does
something as such"

2010
02:06:34,418 --> 02:06:36,796
"that his alliance with you
is taken up.

2011
02:06:37,788 --> 02:06:40,166
And then you meet for an
arranged marriage meeting.

2012
02:06:40,591 --> 02:06:42,264
And again approve of each other.

2013
02:06:44,328 --> 02:06:46,171
Just an absolute perfect marriage.

2014
02:06:46,430 --> 02:06:49,775
Man, I did not want both the
families to feel uncomfortable.

2015
02:06:50,268 --> 02:06:54,182
And if something can achieved
with an arranged marriage then..

2016
02:06:54,672 --> 02:06:55,946
..why unnecessary trouble?

2017
02:06:56,340 --> 02:06:57,341
Exactly.

2018
02:06:57,508 --> 02:06:58,509
Exactly.

2019
02:06:58,843 --> 02:07:00,948
This is also somewhat the
situation of Mark and Soniyo.

2020
02:07:01,913 --> 02:07:02,914
Meaning?

2021
02:07:03,481 --> 02:07:05,017
Soniyo and Mark?

2022
02:07:06,484 --> 02:07:07,485
Yeah.

2023
02:07:07,818 --> 02:07:09,161
What a great love story.

2024
02:07:11,389 --> 02:07:13,391
Despite being so close
for such a long time"

2025
02:07:14,659 --> 02:07:16,832
"they fell in love now.

2026
02:07:17,862 --> 02:07:19,500
But now they can't hurt
their families.

2027
02:07:21,399 --> 02:07:22,275
I see.

2028
02:07:22,300 --> 02:07:23,802
So whose side you are now?

2029
02:07:24,135 --> 02:07:27,275
On your brother's or your friend's?

2030
02:07:28,773 --> 02:07:31,049
Marriage is a lifelong bond.

2031
02:07:32,510 --> 02:07:35,753
A small mistake meaning,
repent forever.

2032
02:07:36,981 --> 02:07:41,430
And I don't wish that Soniyo should
undergo punishment by marrying brother.

2033
02:07:43,988 --> 02:07:44,989
I'm with her.

2034
02:07:45,890 --> 02:07:46,891
Great!

2035
02:07:47,291 --> 02:07:50,602
Then let Mark and Soniyo's
secret remain a secret. - Yes.

2036
02:07:50,795 --> 02:07:53,401
And let everything continue
the way it is continuing.

2037
02:07:53,965 --> 02:07:55,808
But, brother...?

2038
02:07:56,601 --> 02:07:57,705
He won't understand.

2039
02:07:57,768 --> 02:07:59,179
Of course he won't understand...

2040
02:08:06,077 --> 02:08:09,684
That my own brother turned out
to be such a rascal.

2041
02:08:18,990 --> 02:08:20,663
Are we going to
the exhibition or not?

2042
02:09:01,098 --> 02:09:02,099
This my...

2043
02:09:02,566 --> 02:09:03,601
Hey, Mark is here.

2044
02:09:13,210 --> 02:09:15,690
Damn you! You are here too?
Come.

2045
02:09:16,247 --> 02:09:18,227
Today you have had it.
Always your pants drying..

2046
02:09:18,249 --> 02:09:20,320
Today I'll show you whether
my underpants are wet or not!

2047
02:09:20,351 --> 02:09:21,955
Come, I will show you.

2048
02:09:22,219 --> 02:09:24,165
Come. This way.

2049
02:09:29,393 --> 02:09:30,804
Look. Take a look.

2050
02:09:30,995 --> 02:09:32,303
ls it wet, yeah?

2051
02:09:32,463 --> 02:09:33,840
It's wet. ls it wet?

2052
02:09:34,265 --> 02:09:35,266
Uncle!

2053
02:09:41,005 --> 02:09:42,006
What's it?

2054
02:09:42,673 --> 02:09:43,845
I'll die over you.

2055
02:09:44,475 --> 02:09:47,081
Today my beloved looking
so sexy!

2056
02:09:49,480 --> 02:09:50,424
<i>0K3‘!-</i>

2057
02:09:51,415 --> 02:09:52,257
H ey.

2058
02:09:52,316 --> 02:09:53,420
In hurry?

2059
02:09:54,652 --> 02:09:56,256
Okay, so it's this?

2060
02:09:57,355 --> 02:09:59,699
All right. So let's celebrate
honeymoon here itself.

2061
02:10:01,225 --> 02:10:03,637
You seem half ready.

2062
02:10:04,829 --> 02:10:06,206
Come on, let's go, man.

2063
02:10:07,264 --> 02:10:08,265
Please don't go.

2064
02:10:08,332 --> 02:10:10,812
Are you mad,
my pants are down too.

2065
02:10:10,901 --> 02:10:11,777
Mark!

2066
02:10:11,802 --> 02:10:13,179
Oh dad!

2067
02:10:13,971 --> 02:10:15,450
Come on, Mark let's go.
Please!

2068
02:10:15,539 --> 02:10:17,280
Dad is here.
Have you gone mad?

2069
02:10:17,308 --> 02:10:18,378
Mark!
- What are you doing...

2070
02:10:19,610 --> 02:10:20,611
H ey, Mark.

2071
02:10:21,545 --> 02:10:23,024
Where has he gone?

2072
02:10:23,714 --> 02:10:25,921
Guests have started coming
and he's not to be...

2073
02:10:27,051 --> 02:10:29,895
low! The showroom door
is kept open.

2074
02:10:34,258 --> 02:10:35,259
Strange.

2075
02:10:35,459 --> 02:10:36,631
Mansher too is nowhere.

2076
02:10:37,895 --> 02:10:39,203
Where have they all gone?

2077
02:11:01,852 --> 02:11:02,853
Dad...

2078
02:11:03,187 --> 02:11:04,188
He's left.

2079
02:11:06,157 --> 02:11:09,229
Oh! And he also locked the door.

2080
02:11:11,262 --> 02:11:12,707
Come on, get out of here somehow.

2081
02:11:14,231 --> 02:11:15,642
You don't leave.

2082
02:11:19,270 --> 02:11:20,874
Leave here.
- 0k, ﬁne. Let's go.

2083
02:11:21,338 --> 02:11:22,544
Come on, let's go.

2084
02:11:23,073 --> 02:11:24,279
Easy, 839V-

2085
02:11:25,509 --> 02:11:27,546
Almost there. Almost there.
ExceHenL

2086
02:11:29,747 --> 02:11:30,748
Come, come.

2087
02:11:31,315 --> 02:11:32,316
Easy!

2088
02:11:35,486 --> 02:11:36,487
0k, let's go.

2089
02:11:39,023 --> 02:11:39,956
Mark! - Yes?

2090
02:11:39,957 --> 02:11:41,561
My earring is lost.

2091
02:11:41,759 --> 02:11:42,567
Earring?

2092
02:11:42,593 --> 02:11:43,594
Search.

2093
02:11:47,131 --> 02:11:49,077
Wow! Look here.

2094
02:11:52,336 --> 02:11:53,337
Yes, son.

2095
02:11:53,637 --> 02:11:54,980
Everything is just before us.

2096
02:11:55,105 --> 02:11:57,381
Where before you, uncle?
Saw my earring?

2097
02:11:57,575 --> 02:11:59,316
Earring? Which earring?

2098
02:11:59,577 --> 02:12:01,853
_ ear_ring.
Whnch Mark ls helpmg me to search.

2099
02:12:02,680 --> 02:12:04,557
Whenever this Mark is with you..

2100
02:12:04,949 --> 02:12:07,395
..either earrings are lost or you!

2101
02:12:07,485 --> 02:12:08,862
Come buddy, Balli!

2102
02:12:09,119 --> 02:12:12,931
For God's sake at least shut
your box of complaints today.

2103
02:12:13,190 --> 02:12:14,931
This is a big day for this boy.

2104
02:12:15,292 --> 02:12:18,034
And ﬁrst time at my place there
is party with cheese and wine.

2105
02:12:18,362 --> 02:12:19,636
Come let's join it, man!

2106
02:12:20,364 --> 02:12:22,401
Join the fun. My foot!

2107
02:12:22,633 --> 02:12:25,443
Let it be. First tell me..

2108
02:12:26,170 --> 02:12:28,514
..do we look fools?

2109
02:12:29,340 --> 02:12:31,547
Come on, Bally,
what are you saying?

2110
02:12:31,575 --> 02:12:33,282
Just let your false game be.

2111
02:12:33,744 --> 02:12:35,690
These guys look innocent
children to you?

2112
02:12:36,280 --> 02:12:37,816
All of them have gone
blind in their minds.

2113
02:12:39,850 --> 02:12:40,851
Uncle!
- Granny...

2114
02:12:41,418 --> 02:12:42,453
Blind?

2115
02:12:43,220 --> 02:12:45,257
What is he talking about?
- Who it is?

2116
02:12:45,322 --> 02:12:46,858
What are you talking?
- ls she hot?

2117
02:12:47,324 --> 02:12:49,702
Damn you, she's Mark's granny.
- It's enough now.

2118
02:12:49,927 --> 02:12:52,533
I don't want to let my son have
any relations with your kind.

2119
02:12:54,064 --> 02:12:55,065
Why, uncle?

2120
02:12:55,199 --> 02:12:58,703
Just because Mark was helping me
to look for my earring?

2121
02:12:58,969 --> 02:13:02,314
With this innocent face or yours
ask this questions to someone else.

2122
02:13:02,540 --> 02:13:03,644
Io, no, no.

2123
02:13:04,141 --> 02:13:06,212
He himself has come to our
house and stayed.

2124
02:13:06,644 --> 02:13:10,091
And my life's experience
cant's lie to me.

2125
02:13:11,181 --> 02:13:14,651
Soniyo is very innocent and
pure hearted.

2126
02:13:15,019 --> 02:13:17,260
And my Mark's heart is a child.

2127
02:13:17,621 --> 02:13:18,929
They are both innocents, sir.

2128
02:13:18,989 --> 02:13:20,935
Innocent? Let that be.

2129
02:13:21,525 --> 02:13:24,267
I doubt not only the girl
but her entire family.

2130
02:13:24,695 --> 02:13:27,198
Son, come. I don't want to
stay here even for a minute.

2131
02:13:27,631 --> 02:13:28,405
Dear, come let's go.

2132
02:13:28,432 --> 02:13:29,433
<i>“w, Ban!</i>

2133
02:13:33,537 --> 02:13:35,414
As it is this ﬂower like girl..

2134
02:13:35,673 --> 02:13:38,017
..and in a place like yours?
My foot!

2135
02:13:44,114 --> 02:13:47,561
Then take her to your home.
For good.

2136
02:13:48,319 --> 02:13:50,560
I would certainly, my child.

2137
02:13:50,955 --> 02:13:53,959
If everything is happening
due to my Mark..l

2138
02:13:54,224 --> 02:13:56,568
"than it becomes
my responsibility too.

2139
02:13:57,127 --> 02:13:59,107
So, today,
in presence of everyone..

2140
02:13:59,496 --> 02:14:02,477
...I raise the topic of alliance
with Soniyo and Mark".

2141
02:14:02,967 --> 02:14:06,210
..so that this nonsense talks
are stopped for ever.

2142
02:14:08,572 --> 02:14:09,607
Then ﬁne.

2143
02:14:10,207 --> 02:14:11,652
There is no need of this too.

2144
02:14:16,280 --> 02:14:17,281
Stop it!

2145
02:14:18,449 --> 02:14:19,723
Vikram you're hurting me!

2146
02:14:21,218 --> 02:14:22,288
Brother!
- Mark!

2147
02:14:28,659 --> 02:14:29,660
Mark, leave him!

2148
02:14:40,904 --> 02:14:41,905
Mark!

2149
02:14:43,807 --> 02:14:45,548
Stop!
What you two are doing?

2150
02:14:50,047 --> 02:14:52,687
Mark.
What have you done?

2151
02:14:53,283 --> 02:14:55,729
Whatever he did is right.

2152
02:14:56,120 --> 02:15:00,500
Will anyone behave in such barbaric
manner with an innocent girl?

2153
02:15:01,125 --> 02:15:04,334
So of course there should be a
real man to give a beﬁtting reply.

2154
02:15:04,862 --> 02:15:06,307
Mark, my child, come here.

2155
02:15:09,166 --> 02:15:10,167
Come my child.

2156
02:15:11,869 --> 02:15:12,870
Soniyo.

2157
02:15:13,137 --> 02:15:15,174
Do you accept Mark's proposal?

2158
02:15:17,675 --> 02:15:19,586
Whatever you think appropriate.

2159
02:15:20,411 --> 02:15:21,583
And Mark, you?

2160
02:15:23,347 --> 02:15:25,588
Granny this all started due to me..

2161
02:15:26,183 --> 02:15:27,287
..so I and it.

2162
02:15:29,720 --> 02:15:31,757
Soniyo, will you marry ma?

2163
02:15:31,889 --> 02:15:34,426
But son, you are still very young?

2164
02:15:34,925 --> 02:15:37,872
What was your age
when you got married?

2165
02:15:38,295 --> 02:15:41,504
Me...? I was... I was in college.

2166
02:15:42,166 --> 02:15:45,409
So brother, are these two
school going kids?

2167
02:15:45,836 --> 02:15:48,783
And as it is, we will get them
married a leisure, sir.

2168
02:15:49,573 --> 02:15:51,575
Yeah. Yes... yes...

2169
02:15:51,809 --> 02:15:53,083
Unless of course...

2170
02:15:54,111 --> 02:15:58,582
You or your family has any problems
with us or Mark.

2171
02:15:58,849 --> 02:16:01,329
Io brother. Why are you saying it?

2172
02:16:01,952 --> 02:16:03,898
Actually we should be the one
to ask this question.

2173
02:16:03,954 --> 02:16:08,835
Because isn't Soniyo's engagement
is broken before you.

2174
02:16:09,226 --> 02:16:10,728
Hey, forget about him.

2175
02:16:10,894 --> 02:16:12,396
Low that topic has become sissy.

2176
02:16:13,330 --> 02:16:14,274
Mark!

2177
02:16:14,298 --> 02:16:15,299
Yes.

2178
02:16:17,835 --> 02:16:20,247
Here, take this and
put this in her ﬁngers.

2179
02:16:20,771 --> 02:16:21,772
Thanks, granny.

2180
02:16:22,372 --> 02:16:23,373
Soniyo!

2181
02:16:52,202 --> 02:16:53,613
Ladies and gentlemen!

2182
02:16:54,371 --> 02:16:55,873
This is Mark Braganza..

2183
02:16:56,707 --> 02:17:01,918
...for whose hand blown glasses'
exhibition we've gathered here.

2184
02:17:02,179 --> 02:17:03,385
Give him a big hand!

2185
02:17:06,283 --> 02:17:08,354
And now everybody let's 90..

2186
02:17:08,552 --> 02:17:10,759
..among the an. Please.

2187
02:17:10,821 --> 02:17:12,129
Hey!
- Come with me!

2188
02:17:12,289 --> 02:17:13,233
Let's go.

2189
02:17:13,257 --> 02:17:14,258
Come.

2190
02:17:16,326 --> 02:17:17,236
How're you feeling?

2191
02:17:17,261 --> 02:17:18,604
lam feeling good.
How're you feeling?

2192
02:17:18,729 --> 02:17:20,640
I mean, we have done it, somehow.

2193
02:17:22,900 --> 02:17:23,901
Finally.

2194
02:17:25,068 --> 02:17:26,069
ll-

2195
02:17:27,504 --> 02:17:28,574
Look there.
- What's the matter?

2196
02:17:28,605 --> 02:17:29,811
Look over there.
- What?

2197
02:17:36,446 --> 02:17:37,584
Let's go check it up. Come.

2198
02:17:47,291 --> 02:17:49,328
What?
All this was a drama?

2199
02:17:50,060 --> 02:17:51,869
I mean... when was it...?

2200
02:17:52,129 --> 02:17:54,473
Just before coming here.

2201
02:17:55,566 --> 02:17:58,672
Hey, I know you guys since
childhood. Had you said once...

2202
02:17:58,936 --> 02:18:00,108
I can't believe this!

2203
02:18:00,337 --> 02:18:02,783
And we felt that...
You are really cross with us.

2204
02:18:02,906 --> 02:18:04,180
Soniyo, I am a soldier"

2205
02:18:05,509 --> 02:18:07,511
..and entire nation trusts us.

2206
02:18:08,412 --> 02:18:10,153
You should just said once
and seen.

2207
02:18:11,615 --> 02:18:15,188
Who knows to sacriﬁce
better than an Army Ofﬁcer?

2208
02:18:16,220 --> 02:18:17,722
Vikram, acutely thing is..

2209
02:18:18,255 --> 02:18:21,361
"we felt that you won't be
able to understand.

2210
02:18:21,458 --> 02:18:22,937
Mark, how could you think so?

2211
02:18:23,560 --> 02:18:26,598
A soldier who at the border
and places his life at stake"

2212
02:18:26,930 --> 02:18:29,206
...and insures the
smiles of millions..

2213
02:18:29,666 --> 02:18:32,306
..how could he snatch smiles
from your faces?

2214
02:18:33,337 --> 02:18:34,338
ll ot fair.

2215
02:18:36,340 --> 02:18:38,081
I think, you deserve a salute.

2216
02:18:39,810 --> 02:18:41,153
Come on guys now...

2217
02:18:43,413 --> 02:18:44,790
Damn you, who are you
saluting there?

2218
02:18:45,182 --> 02:18:46,456
A driver is standing there.

2219
02:18:46,717 --> 02:18:48,060
Vikram is here.

2220
02:18:51,521 --> 02:18:52,591
Brother".

2221
02:18:52,956 --> 02:18:55,129
...I mean, you should have told me.

2222
02:18:55,392 --> 02:18:57,895
Then your reactions wouldn't
have been natural.

2223
02:18:59,596 --> 02:19:01,906
You know, dude.
You are really something else.

2224
02:19:02,165 --> 02:19:03,940
And... I am sorry for the punch.

2225
02:19:05,769 --> 02:19:06,770
What? Really?

2226
02:19:07,237 --> 02:19:08,238
Yeah.

2227
02:19:10,507 --> 02:19:11,508
Take it back then.

2228
02:19:12,409 --> 02:19:13,080
Oh!

2229
02:19:13,110 --> 02:19:14,384
Vikram... - Brother!
- What do you...

2230
02:19:14,645 --> 02:19:16,215
What are you doing?
- Continue the drama.

2231
02:19:16,313 --> 02:19:18,350
Soniyo's father is coming.
- Oh!

2232
02:19:18,482 --> 02:19:19,722
Damn you, come...

2233
02:19:20,050 --> 02:19:21,051
Minu, Minu!

2234
02:19:21,518 --> 02:19:23,259

2235
02:19:23,387 --> 02:19:24,388
Here take this!

2236
02:19:24,554 --> 02:19:25,464
What are you doing?

2237
02:19:25,489 --> 02:19:26,934
He's hitting him.

2238
02:19:27,925 --> 02:19:28,926
Stop them.

2239
02:19:29,159 --> 02:19:29,967
Take one more.

2240
02:19:29,993 --> 02:19:31,131
Someone stop them.

2241
02:19:31,361 --> 02:19:33,238
Will you dare...

2242
02:19:33,697 --> 02:19:35,904
Look they are hitting
my father. Look he...

2243
02:19:36,033 --> 02:19:37,341
Take some more.
- Why are you hitting. Stop

Hey...

What were you doing?
He's her dad.

2249
02:19:54,084 --> 02:19:55,188
Don't know he...

2250
02:20:08,265 --> 02:20:10,802

2261
02:21:11,928 --> 02:21:14,704
"You got this story hidden"

2262
