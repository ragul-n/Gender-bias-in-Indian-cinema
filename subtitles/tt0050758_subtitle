00:08:29,122 --> 00:08:30,384
Both are equaI partners.

81
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:38,524

Jumma Dada I toId you severaI
times not to caII me master.

88
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:15,100
The master for both

89
00:09:15,168 --> 00:09:16,362
This is true.

90
00:09:16,436 --> 00:09:17,494
Again the same.

91
00:09:17,904 --> 00:09:20,236
If this is the matter of the tongue
then it couId be stopped.

92
00:09:20,306 --> 00:09:23,241
But this is the matter of
heart and we wiII say this.

93
00:10:03,082 --> 00:10:06,142
Kisna, why did you cut this tree?

94
00:10:06,419 --> 00:10:09,081
Orders! I am a worker
of the factory.

95
00:10:09,155 --> 00:10:11,623
This tree beIongs to me
and not your master.

96
00:10:12,091 --> 00:10:13,183
Didn't you see that mark?

97
00:10:13,393 --> 00:10:16,226
Why are you getting angry? If
it is your's then take it.

98
00:10:16,462 --> 00:10:18,259
Did this beIong to your
father that you cut it?

99
00:10:18,331 --> 00:10:21,425
If you take the name of my father
then I wiII kiII you.

100
00:10:21,968 --> 00:10:25,529
Kishan you sIap him he

00:10:25,605 --> 00:10:27,539
I wiII teach him a
Iesson some one day

102
00:10:27,607 --> 00:10:30,132
Hey get Iost from here. - Who
are you to teach him a Iesson..

103
00:10:52,098 --> 00:10:57,502
Those who betray in Iove..

104
00:10:58,438 --> 00:11:04,001
Those who betray in Iove..

105
00:11:04,077 --> 00:11:08,673
They are the seIfish ones.

106
00:11:09,282 --> 00:11:13,446
What can they ever give?

107
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:18,388
They are the seIfish ones.

108
00:11:18,491 --> 00:11:24,293
What can they ever give?

109
00:11:30,636 --> 00:11:35,630
We wiII show the worId.

110
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:42,304
We wiII show the worId.

111
00:11:42,382 --> 00:11:51,654
For the probIems of our friends,

112
00:11:51,991 --> 00:12:02,492
For the probIems of our friends,

113
00:12:34,367 --> 00:12:39,395
This is the country of vaIorous
men those who aIways stay happy.

114
00:12:39,472 --> 00:12:47,777
This country is the
jeweI of the worId.

115
00:13:04,597 --> 00:13:09,796
The braves have a broad chest
the women are innocent Iooking.

116
00:13:09,869 --> 00:13:18,140
The Iovers sing with joy, there
is jamboree in the settIements.

117
00:13:35,428 --> 00:13:42,766
The trees are fiIIed with swings,
the paths are Iined with fIowers.

118
00:13:42,835 --> 00:13:49,263
The dark tresses keep fIying,
the cheeks turn rosy red.

119
00:14:05,725 --> 00:14:10,856
The bravery of the young men, the
amazing feats of the archers.

120
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:15,867
Fairs are heId here every time,

121
00:14:15,935 --> 00:14:19,371
the drums and castanets
are aIways pIayed.

00:14:36,489 --> 00:14:38,753
Our Ioved ones are very
precious to us.

123
00:14:38,824 --> 00:14:41,384
We are very IethaI for our enemies.

124
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:49,890
If we enter the battIefieId

couId be earned.

367
00:34:42,527 --> 00:34:48,432

faster than the men.

Brother Shankar, your

The entire viIIage says that.

My horse is nice, my carriage

432

You. Sister, what do you think?

433
00:39:08,626 --> 00:39:09,752
What do I know?

434
00:39:10,962 --> 00:39:13,795
You don't say what's in

00:39:15,967 --> 00:39:17,025
I don't know.

437
00:39:17,301 --> 00:39:20,634
The heart knows, whose fauIt it is..

438
00:39:20,705 --> 00:39:24,641
..who has Iocked eyes with me..

439

Quiet!

442
00:39:43,728 --> 00:39:47,323
Your sister knows how
to get angry too.

443
00:39:47,999 --> 00:39:50,832
First she used to Iove me
and get angry on me too.

444
00:39:50,902 --> 00:39:53,063
Now she onIy gets angry on me.

445
00:39:53,137 --> 00:39:55,230
No, your sister Ioves

446

She might Iove you, but she
onIy gets angry on me.

447
00:39:58,209 --> 00:39:59,403
What did you say, say it again.

450
00:42:47,511 --> 00:42:49,103
It seems very strange
here, isn't it?

451
00:42:52,183 --> 00:42:55,414
Who knows what peopIe come
to ask for from him.

452
00:42:56,387 --> 00:42:58,014
What did you ask for yourseIf?

453
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:03,589
I wanted to ask something,
but I didn't.

454
00:43:04,929 --> 00:43:05,987
Why?

455
00:43:07,498 --> 00:43:09,864
Whatever I wouId have

456
00:43:09,934 --> 00:43:13,392
..I wouId have asked
it for Kishna too.

457
00:43:14,438 --> 00:43:15,871
And the thing I wanted

458
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:18,602
..I couIdn't have asked
it for Kishna.

459
00:43:26,384 --> 00:43:27,612
Did you ask anything for yourseIf?

460
00:43:33,224 --> 00:43:34,282

461
00:43:36,227 --> 00:43:37,353

462
00:43:40,097 --> 00:43:41,189
What did you ask for?

463
00:43:50,975 --> 00:43:59,110
By asking for your Iove, I
asked for the entire worId.

464
00:43:59,183 --> 00:44:07,090
By asking for your Iove, I

By asking for your Iove..

467
00:44:35,152 --> 00:44:38,349
The heart says, I have
found my beIoved.

468
00:44:39,023 --> 00:44:43,016
I say I have found Iove.

469
00:44:43,094 --> 00:44:46,291
The heart says, I have
found my beIoved.

470
00:44:46,964 --> 00:44:50,627
I say I have found Iove.

471
00:44:50,701 --> 00:44:54,637
I found my Iove, I found my darIing.

472

I found a new worId.

473

I found my Iove, I found my darIing.

474
00:45:03,047 --> 00:45:06,676
I found a new worId.

475
00:45:10,988 --> 00:45:14,719
I found hope, I found desires.

476
00:45:18,662 --> 00:45:22,655
I have found a reason to Iive.

477
00:45:22,733 --> 00:45:25,566
We have found a support.

478
00:45:26,537 --> 00:45:34,706
By asking for your Iove, asked
for the entire worId.

479
00:45:35,079 --> 00:45:38,515
By asking for your Iove

480
00:45:54,598 --> 00:45:58,364
The heart is young, and
the ambience beautifuI.

481
00:45:58,569 --> 00:46:02,596
Let us set out somewhere.

482
00:46:02,673 --> 00:46:06,109
The heart is young, and
the ambience beautifuI.

483
00:46:06,610 --> 00:46:10,512
Let us set out somewhere.

484

You are the ray of hope.

491
00:46:46,417 --> 00:46:54,415
By asking for your Iove, I
asked for the entire worId.

492
00:46:54,492 --> 00:46:58,519
By asking for your Iove,

493

Greetings.
- Come Maharaj.

494
00:47:34,665 --> 00:47:38,362
The sir's horoscope has

495
00:47:38,435 --> 00:47:41,131
This is not a horoscope Maharaj,
they are machines.

496
00:47:41,472 --> 00:47:43,133
They are the horoscopes

..then they must have
come from foreign.

498

The Iines are a bit crooked,
but they are nice.

499
00:47:48,646 --> 00:47:50,671
What do you think?

500
00:47:50,748 --> 00:47:53,216
What if we instaII machines
in the workshop?

501
00:47:53,284 --> 00:47:55,411
Then the entire viIIage
wiII benefit from it.

502
00:47:55,486 --> 00:47:56,544

00:48:02,159 --> 00:48:03,626
Here, you benefit too.

505
00:48:04,495 --> 00:48:07,396
Sir was born during sunrise.

507
00:48:13,170 --> 00:48:14,762
Sir, when are the machines arriving?

508

00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,174
..they wiII arrive any day.

510
00:48:41,765 --> 00:48:43,756
Young master, start the machines.

511
00:48:43,834 --> 00:48:44,892
Yes, start it.

Whenever your tresses fIy.

The girI's hearts gets restIess.

00:49:55,406 --> 00:49:58,864
The girI's hearts gets restIess.

518

When they have such fair faces.

519
00:50:02,746 --> 00:50:05,681
When they have such fair faces.

520
00:50:05,816 --> 00:50:08,546
Then why won't my
sight get diverted?

521
00:50:09,019 --> 00:50:12,682
Then why won't my
sight get diverted?

522
00:50:30,441 --> 00:50:33,501

Look here too.

530
00:51:01,338 --> 00:51:04,000
I am tired to waiting, my dear.

531
00:51:04,541 --> 00:51:08,068
I am tired to waiting, my dear.

532
00:51:25,896 --> 00:51:28,831

00:51:59,863 --> 00:52:03,594
Our paths are the same.

542
00:52:21,084 --> 00:52:24,144

The neighbourhood

Let the moon hide first.

551
00:52:55,452 --> 00:52:58,979
Let the moon hide first.

552
00:53:16,607 --> 00:53:19,599
Your gait is Iike a serpent.

553
00:53:19,877 --> 00:53:22,937
Your gait is Iike a serpent.

00:53:26,950 --> 00:53:29,885

The hermits wiII catch you.

558
00:53:40,964 --> 00:53:43,899

00:54:12,529 --> 00:54:15,123
Nathu, now we have become

00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:17,794
My hands had deveIoped boiIs

565
00:54:17,868 --> 00:54:19,733
Now see, the work done
wiII be much faster.

566
00:54:22,005 --> 00:54:26,135
Mansaram, I say take that
Iog cutting machine.

567
00:54:26,543 --> 00:54:29,603
Jumma dada Iet the young
master give the orders.

568
00:54:30,147 --> 00:54:32,081
Accountant is coming

569
00:54:40,157 --> 00:54:42,557

571
00:54:44,628 --> 00:54:46,892

Seems Iike they are going

582
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,192
Yes Ramu, with Lord's grace.

583
00:55:25,602 --> 00:55:29,060
Listen brother, now machines
have come in the workshop..

584
00:55:29,139 --> 00:55:32,336
..now there is no need
for so many men.

585
00:55:32,876 --> 00:55:35,606
The machine operators have
been caIIed from the city..

586
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:37,670
..because they can operate it.

587
00:55:37,881 --> 00:55:42,284
That's why from today, you are
terminated from your jobs.

588
00:55:44,688 --> 00:55:45,746
What?

589
00:55:46,289 --> 00:55:47,347
Everyone has been terminated.

590
00:56:01,304 --> 00:56:03,101
We are no more needed.

591
00:56:03,306 --> 00:56:04,773
What has happened?

592
00:56:06,243 --> 00:56:07,904
What are you saying accountant?

593
00:56:08,245 --> 00:56:11,112
I am teIIing you the young
master's orders.

594
00:56:11,848 --> 00:56:13,247
What a terribIe thing has happened?

595
00:56:13,784 --> 00:56:16,378
As if the earth has sIipped
from under us.

596
00:56:17,254 --> 00:56:21,315
Happiness is very short Iived.

597
00:56:22,259 --> 00:56:23,317
Accountant.

598
00:56:23,727 --> 00:56:25,854

00:56:28,932 --> 00:56:30,661
Accountant, pIease Iisten to me.

601
00:56:31,802 --> 00:56:32,860
The young master is coming.

602
00:56:36,206 --> 00:56:37,264
Accountant.
- Yes sir.

603
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:38,671
Didn't you give them their money?

604
00:56:38,742 --> 00:56:40,801
I am giving it sir.

605
00:56:47,017 --> 00:56:48,075
Young master.

606
00:56:50,821 --> 00:56:54,279
I have a request on the
behaIf of everyone.

607
00:56:54,891 --> 00:56:57,155
I know what you want to say?

608
00:56:57,694 --> 00:56:59,286
I don't want to fire
aII of you myseIf..

00:56:59,362 --> 00:57:01,159

What is your heIpIessness
young master?

Jumma dada, you are sensibIe

612
00:57:06,169 --> 00:57:10,697
When the machines are here, I
wiII have to pay you for free..

613
00:57:10,774 --> 00:57:12,036
..do you want my Ioss?

614
00:57:12,109 --> 00:57:14,703
No young master, the workshop
that we deveIoped..

615
00:57:14,778 --> 00:57:17,770
..with our hard work, we wouId
never want it to suffer Ioss.

616
00:57:17,848 --> 00:57:20,373
Then fine, you wiII find much work.

617
00:57:31,394 --> 00:57:32,452
What is the matter?

618
00:57:34,064 --> 00:57:38,865
The thing is that, the
machine crippIed us.

619
00:57:53,083 --> 00:57:54,141
Here, eat.

620
00:57:55,752 --> 00:57:59,279
So Raja, how are you? Are you fine?

621
00:58:05,228 --> 00:58:07,423
Raja, shaII I teII you something?

622
00:58:09,966 --> 00:58:11,490
I saw a dream yesterday.

623
00:58:12,903 --> 00:58:13,961
Do you know what?

624
00:58:16,973 --> 00:58:21,307
That trumpets are being
pIayed in our courtyard.

625
00:58:22,445 --> 00:58:26,176
And you have come aIong with
your master to take me.

626
00:58:26,983 --> 00:58:28,041
Did you understand?

627
00:58:28,985 --> 00:58:32,512
But Iisten, don't teII
your master anything.

628
00:58:34,124 --> 00:58:36,524
Yes Raja, don't teII
your master anything.

629
00:58:37,127 --> 00:58:39,254
He has heard everything himseIf.

630
00:58:41,865 --> 00:58:42,923
My bangIes.

631
00:58:43,466 --> 00:58:46,401
Now you wiII be wearing
the marriage bangIes.

632
00:58:48,071 --> 00:58:49,197
You have dreamt it.

633
00:58:50,207 --> 00:58:52,471
Sometimes dreams aIso
occur the opposite way.

634
00:58:52,542 --> 00:58:53,941
That's ever better.

635
00:58:54,477 --> 00:58:56,945
I wiII not come for you, you wiII.

636
00:58:57,013 --> 00:58:59,072
Am I right?
- Shut up.

637
00:59:00,951 --> 00:59:02,009
Rajjo.

638
00:59:04,354 --> 00:59:05,412
Look.

639
00:59:07,824 --> 00:59:08,882
Hey Rajjo..

640
00:59:11,161 --> 00:59:12,219
Take a Iook.

641
00:59:14,898 --> 00:59:15,956
Crazy.

642
00:59:27,978 --> 00:59:29,445
What has happened to you?

643
00:59:32,849 --> 00:59:33,907
Leave me.

644
00:59:40,991 --> 00:59:42,856
You are Iooking very happy today.

645
00:59:42,926 --> 00:59:45,326
Yes mother, I am happy today.

646
00:59:46,129 --> 00:59:47,858
Now I wiII have to get you married.

647
00:59:47,931 --> 00:59:49,865
Why? What mistake have I committed..

648
00:59:49,933 --> 00:59:51,400
..that you wiII get me married?

649
00:59:52,269 --> 00:59:55,067
If you don't commit a mistake,
then won't I get you married?

650
00:59:58,008 --> 01:00:00,203
TeII me, how do you find Rajni?

651
01:00:00,277 --> 01:00:01,335
Who?

652
01:00:01,611 --> 01:00:06,878
Our Rajni.
- Aunt Durga's daughter.

653
01:00:06,950 --> 01:00:10,078
Yes, how do you find her?

654
01:00:13,023 --> 01:00:16,083
She is a girI.
- Yes she is a girI.

655
01:00:16,293 --> 01:00:17,487
So do you Iike her?

656
01:00:20,297 --> 01:00:23,095
Why are you asking me mother,
do you Iike her?

657
01:00:23,166 --> 01:00:24,497
Yes, I Iike her a Iot.

658
01:00:25,101 --> 01:00:26,159
WiII you marry her?

659
01:00:26,903 --> 01:00:27,961

01:00:32,976 --> 01:00:34,034
TeII me.

662
01:00:35,245 --> 01:00:36,906
What are you doing?

663
01:00:37,580 --> 01:00:38,979
TeII me, wiII you marry her or not?

664
01:00:40,050 --> 01:00:42,109
Okay, if you say so then
I wiII marry her.

665
01:00:42,385 --> 01:00:44,444
You wiII marry her because I say so?

666
01:00:44,521 --> 01:00:46,318
Yes, I wiII just because you say so.

667
01:00:46,589 --> 01:00:48,454
My son is so innocent.

668
01:00:48,525 --> 01:00:50,322
But mother.
- What?

669
01:00:51,594 --> 01:00:56,122
Our Manju, she shouId
get married first.

670
01:00:56,466 --> 01:00:58,263
I was about to say the same thing.

671
01:00:59,202 --> 01:01:02,603
The engagement has been decided,
but they are from another viIIage.

672
01:01:03,406 --> 01:01:06,341
Go some day and fix the date.

673
01:01:07,010 --> 01:01:10,343
Why some day, I wiII send the
news there today itseIf.

674
01:01:10,613 --> 01:01:13,343
Yes, you wiII want to hurry
up everything now?

675
01:01:13,416 --> 01:01:15,680
Why? Why?
- Why?

676
01:01:52,122 --> 01:01:57,458
Greetings uncIe.
- Come on, are you fine.

677
01:01:58,194 --> 01:02:01,391
I have come to ask
about your heaIth.

678
01:02:01,531 --> 01:02:04,125
I am absoIuteIy fine.

679
01:02:05,335 --> 01:02:10,534
I am trying to make my ends
meet in this oId age.

680
01:02:19,616 --> 01:02:23,609
It seems Iike the miII
workers are in troubIe.

681
01:02:24,687 --> 01:02:30,216
Don't ask. These are
very troubIed times.

682
01:02:32,028 --> 01:02:36,692
Since these machines have arrived,
peopIe's homes have been ruined.

683
01:02:38,168 --> 01:02:41,626
Son, but you stiII feeI hungry.

684
01:02:42,639 --> 01:02:46,166
What shaII we do to our wife
and chiIdren? StrangIe them.

685
01:02:48,111 --> 01:02:51,308
PeopIe are thinking of
Ieaving the viIIage.

686
01:03:02,592 --> 01:03:04,321
That's a very terribIe thing uncIe.

687
01:03:05,462 --> 01:03:06,793
But what can be done, son.

688
01:03:08,465 --> 01:03:12,526
No, this cannot happen.

689
01:03:14,337 --> 01:03:15,463
It cannot happen.

690
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:38,491
So you drive a horse carriage?

691
01:03:40,497 --> 01:03:41,759
My father used to do this too.

692
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:45,092
There are onIy two castes
in our viIIage..

693
01:03:45,168 --> 01:03:47,636
..the workshop workers and
the horse carriage drivers.

694
01:03:49,105 --> 01:03:53,371
And since your arrivaI the workshop
workers have become jobIess.

695
01:03:54,244 --> 01:03:56,439
But what do you care about
the workshop workers.

696
01:03:57,180 --> 01:03:58,238
What do I care?

697
01:03:58,648 --> 01:04:00,309
If try to understand,
it is very deep.

698
01:04:01,251 --> 01:04:03,719
It is one viIIage, and everyone
Ioves each other.

699
01:04:03,786 --> 01:04:05,117
And when there is a
probIem amongst us..

700
01:04:05,188 --> 01:04:06,849
..then everyone tries to
find a soIution for it.

701
01:04:07,457 --> 01:04:10,517
Fine, but why don't they
Iook for some other work?

702
01:04:10,593 --> 01:04:12,390
What other work wiII they do sir?

703
01:04:13,196 --> 01:04:14,788
There isn't it farming
in this viIIage.

704
01:04:14,864 --> 01:04:17,662
Yes, but they can go
in the city and work.

705
01:04:22,739 --> 01:04:24,866
You want to send the residents
here to the foreign Iand.

706
01:04:27,410 --> 01:04:29,810
No one wants to I eave their pIace.

707
01:04:31,347 --> 01:04:34,680
But I have Ieft the city too
and come here for work.

708
01:04:35,285 --> 01:04:37,150
You have come to expand
your justice..

709
01:04:37,220 --> 01:04:40,417
..and you are sending these poor
peopIe out to beg, is this justice?

710
01:04:42,292 --> 01:04:47,161
Sir, I have aIways heard that rich
peopIe aIways buiId viIIages..

711
01:04:47,230 --> 01:04:49,357
..do you want to demoIish this one?

712
01:04:51,234 --> 01:04:54,897
Look, I don't argue
much with peopIe.

713
01:04:55,772 --> 01:04:58,172
Now much more work is done in the
workshop, we earn much more..

714
01:04:58,241 --> 01:05:00,766
..I had instaIIed the machines
for that purpose.

715
01:05:01,311 --> 01:05:04,178
Can't you find a way so
that you benefit too..

716
01:05:04,247 --> 01:05:07,375
..and the poor peopIe
meet their basic needs.

717
01:05:18,328 --> 01:05:20,387
Do you smoke cigar?
- What?

718
01:05:32,809 --> 01:05:35,277
We poor peopIe are not
worthy of it sir.

719
01:05:36,479 --> 01:05:38,674
Rich peopIe Iike you
drink up everything.

720
01:05:39,549 --> 01:05:41,540
If you want, then you
drink up our bIood too.

721
01:05:41,618 --> 01:05:43,210
You have come to argue with me!

722
01:05:43,286 --> 01:05:45,618
The rich and poor can
never quarreI sir!

723
01:05:46,422 --> 01:05:48,549
The quarreI is between the
hands and the machines.

724
01:06:28,798 --> 01:06:30,789
You are Ieaving this viIIage
in this oId age.

725
01:06:31,334 --> 01:06:34,997
Yes, or eIse we wiII have
to Ieave this worId.

726
01:06:38,408 --> 01:06:39,466
Okay.

727
01:06:40,610 --> 01:06:41,668
Bye.

728
01:07:16,579 --> 01:07:18,444
No aunt, you must have
heard it wrong.

729
01:07:18,514 --> 01:07:21,574
Why wiII I Iie?

730
01:07:21,851 --> 01:07:24,649
I toId you what I heard.

731
01:07:24,987 --> 01:07:26,921
But aunt we have some respected too.

732
01:07:27,590 --> 01:07:28,989
After aII we are the bride's famiIy.

733
01:07:29,459 --> 01:07:30,926
The issue wiII spread quickIy.

734
01:07:31,527 --> 01:07:33,461
Who aII wiII I answer?

735
01:07:33,730 --> 01:07:35,664
What is the matter mother,
what happened?

736
01:07:35,732 --> 01:07:39,327
What can happen, you didn't taIk to
the grooms famiIy for so Iong..

737
01:07:39,402 --> 01:07:42,530
..now they are fixing the
marriage with someone eIse.

738
01:07:42,605 --> 01:07:44,596
What, they are fixing
it with someone eIse.

739
01:07:44,674 --> 01:07:46,073
Yes, ask aunt.

740
01:07:46,809 --> 01:07:48,936
But they had come to ask
for her hand themseIves.

741
01:07:49,412 --> 01:07:51,073
When they had fixed it themseIves,
then what's the matter.

742
01:07:51,481 --> 01:07:54,541
That's what I am saying, what
wiII happen to my daughter now?

743
01:07:54,884 --> 01:07:56,408
How wiII I face anyone now?

744
01:07:56,486 --> 01:07:59,546
Do heII with them, is this a joke?

745
01:07:59,956 --> 01:08:01,082
I wiII not Iet that happen.

746
01:08:01,891 --> 01:08:03,552
Come on aunt, come with me.

747
01:08:03,826 --> 01:08:05,885
You don't worry mother,
come on aunt.

748
01:08:06,429 --> 01:08:10,490
I had understood that your
intentions have gone bad!

749
01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:11,958
Then you can think that.

750
01:08:12,368 --> 01:08:16,361
It is very cIear, the brides famiIy
is giving me 2000 rupees..

751
01:08:16,439 --> 01:08:18,771
..you give me, and the proposaI
wiII stay in your house.

752
01:08:19,041 --> 01:08:20,440
This is business.

753
01:08:20,777 --> 01:08:23,109
I wiII not Iet that happen,
understand.

754
01:08:23,913 --> 01:08:26,780
I wiII not Iet you pIay with
my respect for money!

755
01:08:27,650 --> 01:08:29,914
Then wiII you bring your
sister at my threshoId.

756
01:08:29,986 --> 01:08:33,854
Quiet! I wiII kiII you
if you say that again!

757
01:08:34,991 --> 01:08:37,391
Just Iike you had fixed the
marriage in front of everyone..

758
01:08:37,460 --> 01:08:40,452
..you wiII have to break
it, understood!

759
01:08:40,530 --> 01:08:41,588
Come on get up!

760
01:08:41,664 --> 01:08:42,722
Come on! Come, come.

761
01:08:42,799 --> 01:08:44,790
Let me see, what can they do to me?

762
01:08:44,867 --> 01:08:46,596
You dare taIk so much.

763
01:08:46,803 --> 01:08:47,997
Come on, Iet us see.

764
01:08:49,071 --> 01:08:51,869
Come on, who are afraid
of the viIIage heads.

765
01:08:51,941 --> 01:08:56,674
They are the protectors,
what is so great.

766
01:08:56,746 --> 01:08:58,543
Say it in front of everyone!

767
01:08:59,081 --> 01:09:01,413
Say it in front of everyone that
it is not my sister's fauIt..

768
01:09:01,484 --> 01:09:03,145
..and you are breaking
the reIation for money!

769
01:09:03,619 --> 01:09:06,884
So what if I am breaking it fro
money, who are you to stop me?

770
01:09:07,023 --> 01:09:09,548
This doesn't happen in our viIIage.

771
01:09:09,625 --> 01:09:12,560
Why not, he is my son I can get
him married wherever I want.

772
01:09:12,628 --> 01:09:14,027
It is a sin to break the reIation
after binding it!

773
01:09:14,096 --> 01:09:15,893
And it defames the
viIIage too Ganpat!

774
01:09:15,965 --> 01:09:17,956
I don't care about
the entire viIIage.

775
01:09:18,034 --> 01:09:20,832
Look, this proposaI wiII
stay in Shankar's house..

776
01:09:20,903 --> 01:09:22,768
..or eIse we wiII throw
you out of the viIIage.

777
01:09:22,839 --> 01:09:23,897
Yes, that's right!

778
01:09:25,775 --> 01:09:28,903
Okay brothers, if that's
your advice..

779
01:09:28,978 --> 01:09:30,969
..then I wiII keep the proposaI
in Shankar's house.

780
01:09:31,047 --> 01:09:34,107
Who wiII send their sister in
a scoundreI's house Iike you!

781
01:09:34,984 --> 01:09:37,976
Good that you showed your true
face before the marriage!

782
01:09:38,654 --> 01:09:40,986
I am breaking the reIation myseIf.

783
01:09:41,591 --> 01:09:44,458
But remember, you have ignored
her for weaIth..

784
01:09:44,527 --> 01:09:45,994
..you wiII suffer aII your Iife!

785
01:10:20,029 --> 01:10:21,223
What happened?

786
01:10:22,632 --> 01:10:23,690
Nothing mother.

787
01:10:25,968 --> 01:10:28,095
They turned out to be crooks.

788
01:10:28,638 --> 01:10:30,037
I broke the engagement myseIf.

789
01:10:31,107 --> 01:10:32,574
You broke the engagement.
- Yes.

790
01:10:32,642 --> 01:10:34,974
What did you do, the
girI wiII be defamed.

791
01:10:35,044 --> 01:10:38,639
She wiII not be defamed,
don't taIk nonsense.

792
01:10:38,714 --> 01:10:40,181
What wiII happen now?

793
01:10:40,249 --> 01:10:42,717
What wiII we do now? We have to
get Manju married, isn't it?

794
01:10:42,919 --> 01:10:44,910
Then wiII we keep her
unmarried in the house?

795
01:10:44,987 --> 01:10:47,182
I wiII get her married,
why are worried.

796
01:10:47,523 --> 01:10:48,785
Who wiII you get her married too?

797
01:10:48,858 --> 01:10:53,989
Look, my friend Kishna. I wiII
get her married to him.

798
01:10:55,531 --> 01:10:56,657
Kishna.
- Yes.

799
01:10:57,199 --> 01:10:59,724
I didn't even think about it.
- See.

800
01:11:00,536 --> 01:11:02,868
Kishna is one our own.
- That he is.

801
01:11:02,939 --> 01:11:05,271
But who wiII taIk to him?

802
01:11:05,741 --> 01:11:09,006
I wiII taIk to him, why
are you worried I wiII.

803
01:11:09,078 --> 01:11:10,136
You wiII.
- Yes.

804
01:11:13,149 --> 01:11:17,745
Kishna.. oh Kishna..
- Oh Shankar..

805
01:11:18,888 --> 01:11:19,946
Come, come, come.

806
01:11:20,022 --> 01:11:22,286
You have come at the right moment.

807
01:11:25,561 --> 01:11:30,965
Come sit, have something.
- No, I wiII drink water.

808
01:11:31,033 --> 01:11:32,091
First have something.

809
01:11:32,635 --> 01:11:35,229
Look, such deIicious vegetabIe.
- Give me.

810
01:11:36,839 --> 01:11:38,773
I waited for you in the morning,
but you didn't come.

811
01:11:39,709 --> 01:11:44,043
I had gone to the other viIIage.
- Okay.

812
01:11:45,581 --> 01:11:46,912
I have broken Manu's engagement.

813
01:11:48,651 --> 01:11:49,709
You have broken her engagement.

814
01:11:50,653 --> 01:11:52,985
You did a very nice thing.
- A nice thing?

815
01:11:53,055 --> 01:11:55,580
It was a different viIIage..

816
01:11:55,658 --> 01:11:57,250
..she wiII find someone
better in our viIIage.

817
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:07,731
Take my advice, get married.

818
01:12:08,270 --> 01:12:12,331
Marriage, you just said
what I was about to.

819
01:12:12,808 --> 01:12:17,802
But there is one thing, both of
us shouId get married together.

820
01:12:20,149 --> 01:12:21,343
Then I wiII get married too.

821
01:12:22,351 --> 01:12:24,342
If you say, then I wiII
fix the marriage today.

822
01:12:25,688 --> 01:12:26,746
But ask her first.

823
01:12:27,957 --> 01:12:29,015
Whom do I have to ask?

824
01:12:30,826 --> 01:12:33,021
I have to do everything,
whom shouId I ask.

825
01:12:34,697 --> 01:12:37,359
That's fine, but someone
shouId taIk to aunt too.

826
01:12:37,767 --> 01:12:41,225
My mother has taIked to aunt,
you teII me your wiII.

827
01:12:42,972 --> 01:12:44,963
I feeI a bit shy whiIe saying it.

828
01:12:45,775 --> 01:12:46,833
You are feeIing shy.

829
01:12:48,310 --> 01:12:49,368
Hey you..

830
01:12:49,779 --> 01:12:55,376
I am a Ioudmouth, but when
Rajni is concerned..

831
01:13:01,323 --> 01:13:03,655
Rajni.
- Yes.

832
01:13:06,662 --> 01:13:08,186
How wiII she suite me?

833
01:13:14,336 --> 01:13:15,394
Why are you quiet?

834
01:13:20,009 --> 01:13:21,067
Yes, teII me.

835
01:13:24,346 --> 01:13:26,405
Where are you going?

836
01:13:27,883 --> 01:13:29,680
You didn't taIk about
your marriage..

837
01:13:29,752 --> 01:13:30,810
..then how wiII we get
married together?

838
01:13:31,687 --> 01:13:32,813
We cannot get married together now?

839
01:13:32,888 --> 01:13:34,412
What happened?

840
01:13:34,690 --> 01:13:35,884
You wiII not be abIe
to hear it Kishna.

841
01:13:36,025 --> 01:13:38,687
Look, you are under
my oath, teII me!

842
01:13:38,761 --> 01:13:40,023
Don't give me your oath.

843
01:13:40,229 --> 01:13:42,094
Look, you are under the oath
of out friendship, teII me.

844
01:13:44,100 --> 01:13:46,432
Okay, then Iisten.

845
01:13:47,837 --> 01:13:49,828
Even I wanted to marry her.

846
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:52,969
You too.
- Yes.

847
01:13:53,375 --> 01:13:57,038
Don't joke with me.

848
01:13:58,714 --> 01:13:59,772
Joke.

849
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:06,447
Fate has pIayed a joke on us friend.

850
01:14:07,723 --> 01:14:11,454
Are you teIIing the truth?
- Yes it is true.

851
01:14:15,131 --> 01:14:16,462
But how is that possibIe?

852
01:14:19,201 --> 01:14:20,259
Yes, how can it be possibIe?

853
01:14:21,804 --> 01:14:24,932
We both are one, but she can
beIong onIy to one of us.

854
01:14:29,879 --> 01:14:33,144
This is a very big probIem.

855
01:14:34,083 --> 01:14:35,812
I wiII soIve the probIem.

856
01:14:36,418 --> 01:14:38,215
You get married to Rajni..
- Kishna..

857
01:14:39,822 --> 01:14:41,084
Look, you are taIking
indifferentIy..

858
01:14:41,157 --> 01:14:43,887
..there shouId not be difference
in our friendship, friend.

859
01:14:49,298 --> 01:14:51,027
How did Iove come

860
01:15:09,451 --> 01:15:10,509
Have you thought of anything?

861
01:15:11,453 --> 01:15:13,978
What can I think of, you
thing of something.

862
01:15:20,196 --> 01:15:22,391
I can see onIy one soIution.

863
01:15:25,334 --> 01:15:26,995
You marry her, I wiII
move out of your way.

864
01:15:35,010 --> 01:15:37,274
No, I don't want to come
between your Iove!

865
01:15:37,346 --> 01:15:39,007
Then how wiII we decide!

866
01:15:52,828 --> 01:15:53,886
Krishna.
- Yes.

867
01:15:54,363 --> 01:15:56,354
Let us do one thing.
- TeII me.

868
01:15:58,500 --> 01:16:02,095
Let us Ieave the decision of
our fates on God. - On God!

869
01:16:02,171 --> 01:16:03,229
Yes.
- How is that?

870
01:16:04,039 --> 01:16:07,372
Tomorrow is the veneration
in the viIIage tempIe.

871
01:16:07,443 --> 01:16:09,911
The entire viIIage wiII go to
offer fIowers. - She wiII.

872
01:16:09,979 --> 01:16:11,037
Rajni wiII go too.

873
01:16:11,113 --> 01:16:14,844
If Rajni offers the white fIowers,
then she is yours.

874
01:16:14,917 --> 01:16:15,975
What?

875
01:16:16,051 --> 01:16:17,848
Look, Rajni wiII go to
the tempIe tomorrow.

876
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:21,055
if she offers the white fIowers,
then she is yours..

877
01:16:21,123 --> 01:16:23,250
..and if she offers the yeIIow
fIowers then she is mine.

878
01:16:23,325 --> 01:16:26,385
Why? - You have aIready
pIanned your victory.

879
01:16:26,929 --> 01:16:29,989
You know that the yeIIow fIowers
are aIways offered in the tempIe.

880
01:16:30,065 --> 01:16:31,532
Then you take the yeIIow fIowers..

881
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:34,068
..and she offers the white fIowers,
then she is mine.

882
01:16:34,270 --> 01:16:36,864
Remember, if she offers
the white fIowers..

883
01:16:36,939 --> 01:16:38,873
..then she is yours. - And if
she offers the yeIIow fIowers..

884
01:16:38,941 --> 01:16:40,067
..then she is yours.

885
01:16:40,142 --> 01:16:41,200
Fine.
- Yes.

886
01:16:41,343 --> 01:16:42,401
Do you agree?
- I agree.

887
01:16:43,145 --> 01:16:44,203
Then shake hands.

888
01:16:51,553 --> 01:16:55,489
Come if you have too.

889
01:16:58,427 --> 01:17:08,632
There are no turns in the path.

890
01:17:10,372 --> 01:17:24,378
There is deIay but not deniaI.

891
01:17:42,938 --> 01:17:44,929
Come if you have too.

892
01:17:45,007 --> 01:17:48,670
There are no turns in the path.

893
01:17:49,345 --> 01:17:55,079
There is deIay but not deniaI.

894
01:17:55,484 --> 01:17:57,418
Come if you have too.

895
01:17:57,486 --> 01:18:01,149
There are no turns in the path.

896
01:18:01,623 --> 01:18:07,152
There is deIay but not deniaI.

897
01:18:07,963 --> 01:18:09,555
Come if you have too.

898
01:18:27,983 --> 01:18:33,444
When you can't soIve your probIems.

899
01:18:34,256 --> 01:18:39,455
When you can't soIve your probIems.

900
01:18:40,195 --> 01:18:45,599
Have faith in Lord's justice.

901
01:18:52,608 --> 01:18:58,137
He wiII resoIve your probIems.

902
01:18:58,547 --> 01:19:04,144
He wiII resoIve your probIems.

903
01:19:04,686 --> 01:19:10,215
The Lord wiII do what
you couIdn't do.

904
01:19:10,692 --> 01:19:16,153
The Lord wiII do what
you couIdn't do.

905
01:19:16,632 --> 01:19:19,157
The Lord wiII do..

906
01:19:19,701 --> 01:19:21,760
Come if you have too.

907
01:19:22,037 --> 01:19:25,438
There are no turns in the path.

908
01:19:26,108 --> 01:19:31,512
There is deIay but not deniaI.

909
01:19:32,181 --> 01:19:34,046
Come if you have too.

910
01:19:52,401 --> 01:19:57,668
There is no need to say anything,
your arrivaI is enough.

911
01:19:58,407 --> 01:20:03,606
There is no need to say anything,
your arrivaI is enough.

912
01:20:04,346 --> 01:20:09,613
Bowing at this threshoId is enough.

913
01:20:16,625 --> 01:20:21,824
He knows everything
that's in your heart.

914
01:20:22,564 --> 01:20:28,093
He knows everything
that's in your heart.

915
01:20:28,570 --> 01:20:33,837
The Lord knows your every condition.

916
01:20:34,643 --> 01:20:42,846
The Lord knows your every condition.

917
01:20:43,652 --> 01:20:45,711
Come if you have too.

918
01:20:45,787 --> 01:20:49,450
There are no turns in the path.

919
01:20:49,791 --> 01:20:55,388
There is deIay but not deniaI.

920
01:20:56,131 --> 01:20:57,860
Come if you have too.

921
01:21:16,218 --> 01:21:21,554
Your wishes are fuIfiIIed
without asking.

922
01:21:22,224 --> 01:21:27,560
Your wishes are fuIfiIIed
without asking.

923
01:21:28,230 --> 01:21:33,566
Those whose hearts are pure
get take sheIter here.

924
01:21:40,442 --> 01:21:45,846
This is the court where
you get justice.

925
01:21:46,582 --> 01:21:51,849
This is the court where
you get justice.

926
01:21:52,654 --> 01:21:57,921
He is the uItimate master
of the worId.

927
01:21:58,727 --> 01:22:04,188
He is the uItimate
master of the worId.

928
01:22:04,266 --> 01:22:06,928
He is the uItimate
master of the worId.

929
01:22:07,736 --> 01:22:09,601
Come if you have too.

930
01:22:09,671 --> 01:22:13,402
There are no turns in the path.

931
01:22:14,276 --> 01:22:19,407
There is deIay but not deniaI.

932
01:22:19,815 --> 01:22:21,749
Come if you have too.

933
01:22:50,579 --> 01:22:51,637
Kishna!

934
01:22:54,316 --> 01:22:55,374
Kishna!

935
01:23:09,731 --> 01:23:10,993
What is this, Iisten to me!

936
01:23:23,945 --> 01:23:26,743
WiII teII me something,
what is the matter?

937
01:23:27,349 --> 01:23:29,010
ScoundreI, you deceived me!

938
01:23:29,484 --> 01:23:30,542
You betrayed your friend!

939
01:23:32,354 --> 01:23:33,412
I betrayed.

940
01:23:33,689 --> 01:23:36,021
Not just that, You showed
your true face!

941
01:23:36,558 --> 01:23:38,287
You showed me what
a Iow Iife you are!

942
01:23:39,561 --> 01:23:41,495
Such taIks don't suit you.

943
01:23:41,830 --> 01:23:43,695
This didn't but she did, isn't it?

944
01:23:44,433 --> 01:23:46,697
You made your sister
exchange the fIowers!

945
01:23:46,835 --> 01:23:47,893
Move, deceiver.

946
01:23:48,904 --> 01:23:51,771
If you want to change
the topic, then do it.

947
01:23:52,307 --> 01:23:53,365
But don't say such things.

948
01:23:53,575 --> 01:23:56,373
I swear on our friendship..
- You betrayed our friendship!

949
01:23:56,445 --> 01:23:57,639
And that too for a girI!

950
01:23:58,580 --> 01:24:01,515
Mind your tongue. That's enough now!

951
01:24:01,583 --> 01:24:03,642
Why shouId I mind my tongue
for a scoundreI?

952
01:24:04,453 --> 01:24:05,511
Go away from here.

953
01:24:05,854 --> 01:24:07,515
I might raise my hand,
get out of here!

954
01:24:07,789 --> 01:24:08,847
You wiII raise your hand!

955
01:27:10,505 --> 01:27:12,837
Are you angry with me?
- No.

956
01:27:15,644 --> 01:27:16,702
You don't even taIk to me.

957
01:27:18,580 --> 01:27:20,047
You aIways Iook away
whenever I come.

958
01:27:22,651 --> 01:27:23,913
What can I say?

959
01:27:27,188 --> 01:27:29,053
If someone eIse wouId have done it..

960
01:27:29,124 --> 01:27:30,648
..then I wouIdn't have minded.

961
01:27:33,061 --> 01:27:34,995
When you do it, it
doesn't feeI right.

962
01:27:36,064 --> 01:27:37,531
I feeI very hurt.

963
01:27:39,801 --> 01:27:42,793
I feeI as if I am of no importance.

964
01:27:48,076 --> 01:27:51,944
Because of you, I Iost my friend.

965
01:27:54,683 --> 01:27:58,016
I am not at fauIt for it.

966
01:28:00,021 --> 01:28:02,546
If I had known that this
wouId have resuIted..

967
01:28:02,624 --> 01:28:04,956
..then I wouIdn't have
even Iooked at you.

968
01:28:07,095 --> 01:28:08,619
Don't make me feeI any more ashamed.

969
01:28:10,031 --> 01:28:14,627
I am the one who is feeIing
ashamed, what did you Iose?

970
01:28:16,638 --> 01:28:18,902
It was my mistake that I
feII in Iove with you.

971
01:28:20,241 --> 01:28:23,972
Anyway, I cannot go back
from where I am now.

972
01:28:25,246 --> 01:28:29,842
But I wiII not stop you, you can go.

973
01:28:30,785 --> 01:28:33,652
A woman couId never understand
a man's friendship.

974
01:28:34,789 --> 01:28:39,192
I don't even want to,
I know my worth now.

975
01:28:39,794 --> 01:28:40,852
That's enough.

976
01:29:03,685 --> 01:29:04,743
Why have you come here?

977
01:29:05,153 --> 01:29:07,678
I have come to say something.

978
01:29:07,889 --> 01:29:10,016
I don't want to hear anything,
go away!

979
01:29:10,959 --> 01:29:12,824
But there is no harm in
Iistening to what I say.

980
01:29:13,094 --> 01:29:15,153
There is no harm in Iistening,
but the intentions are bad!

981
01:29:15,630 --> 01:29:16,892
He is dead for aII of you.

982
01:29:17,298 --> 01:29:21,098
For God's sake don't say that,
may I die first.

983
01:29:21,169 --> 01:29:22,227
Quiet!

984
01:29:22,904 --> 01:29:24,633
You know very weII to
twist the matter..

985
01:29:24,706 --> 01:29:26,640
..and your brother knows
how to ruin everything..

986
01:29:26,708 --> 01:29:27,970
..but you cannot harm me!

987
01:29:28,176 --> 01:29:29,370
I don't care for anyone, understood.

988
01:29:29,911 --> 01:29:31,173
But pIease Iisten to me.

989
01:29:31,312 --> 01:29:33,644
I don't even want
to see your faces..

990
01:29:33,715 --> 01:29:35,842
..don't you dare step
foot on this threshoId!

991
01:29:36,117 --> 01:29:37,175
WiII you go or not?

992
01:29:38,186 --> 01:29:39,244
I am going.

993
01:29:44,192 --> 01:29:47,787
Wait! - I was saying that, you
didn't understand anything..

994
01:29:48,196 --> 01:29:50,061
Here, the symboI of
friendship and Iove!

995
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:54,928
Everything your brother
ate is in this?

996
01:29:55,203 --> 01:29:57,330
Take it aIong!

997
01:29:58,006 --> 01:30:01,669
And teII him, tiII now
you saw my friendship..

998
01:30:01,743 --> 01:30:03,734
..and now you wiII see my enmity!

999
01:30:19,761 --> 01:30:21,228
You seem to be a sensibIe man.

1000
01:30:22,697 --> 01:30:24,221
It can be very beneficiaI.

1001
01:30:26,034 --> 01:30:27,831
Then you think about the benefit..

1002
01:30:29,838 --> 01:30:31,169
..and I wiII think about the Iosses.

1003
01:30:32,774 --> 01:30:33,832
Take this..

1004
01:30:40,915 --> 01:30:43,440
I didn't give you this
idea for money, sir.

1005
01:31:08,943 --> 01:31:10,410
Traverse an hours journey
in 10 minutes.

1006
01:31:10,478 --> 01:31:11,809
One rupee, one rupee.

1007
01:31:13,748 --> 01:31:15,079
Where did this aeropIane come from?

1008
01:31:15,750 --> 01:31:16,808
Motorcar.

1009
01:31:43,311 --> 01:31:44,505
Come quickIy.

1010
01:31:55,857 --> 01:31:57,051
Chaudhary, what is this going on.

1011
01:31:57,258 --> 01:32:00,250
I say, who has brought
this bus here?

1012
01:32:00,328 --> 01:32:02,319
Who eIse can it be other
than the young master?

1013
01:32:02,397 --> 01:32:05,924
He seems to be a crook.

1014
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,867
You don't know, he wants
us to become jobIess!

1015
01:32:09,003 --> 01:32:11,995
We wiII set his bus on fire.
- Yes, we wiII!

1016
01:32:12,340 --> 01:32:14,205
Listen, if you don't Iisten to me..

1017
01:32:14,275 --> 01:32:19,212
..then I wiII burn his bus
and workshop down to ashes.

1018
01:32:19,280 --> 01:32:22,875
Come, today we wiII come
to a decision! - Yes!

1019
01:32:33,962 --> 01:32:36,487
Go and caII your master.
- Yes, caII him.

1020
01:32:37,498 --> 01:32:39,557
Why, what is the matter?

1021
01:32:43,438 --> 01:32:46,965
Sir, have you brought this bus?
- Why?

1022
01:32:47,842 --> 01:32:49,173
Do you want us to die of starvation?

1023
01:32:49,377 --> 01:32:51,311
Do you want us to
Ieave this viIIage?

1024
01:32:51,446 --> 01:32:54,108
Do you want to make us jobIess?

1025
01:32:54,249 --> 01:32:56,843
Thinking that we are weak,
you want to progress..

1026
01:32:56,918 --> 01:32:57,976
..at the price of our jobs?

1027
01:32:58,186 --> 01:33:00,916
No, you are getting me wrong.

1028
01:33:01,456 --> 01:33:03,583
I want to progress
the entire viIIage.

1029
01:33:04,459 --> 01:33:06,859
Think, understand it is
the era of progress..

1030
01:33:06,928 --> 01:33:10,864
..machines and motorcars are being
used aII over the worId..

1031
01:33:10,932 --> 01:33:13,400
..and it is for the betterment
of our country.

1032
01:33:16,938 --> 01:33:19,532
Whatever is happening in the
country, it must be fine.

1033
01:33:20,408 --> 01:33:23,866
But this viIIage is in that country
to, think about it too!

1034
01:33:23,945 --> 01:33:25,207
But whatever I am doing..

1035
01:33:25,280 --> 01:33:26,941
..it is for the betterment
of the viIIage.

1036
01:33:27,081 --> 01:33:29,413
You are thinking about the
viIIages betterment.

1037
01:33:29,550 --> 01:33:32,417
As you instaIIed the machines,
the workers became jobIess.

1038
01:33:32,553 --> 01:33:34,487
They had to Ieave
on a empty stomach.

1039
01:33:35,089 --> 01:33:36,351
And now you have brought motorcars..

1040
01:33:36,424 --> 01:33:38,289
..so that we carriage
drivers Ieave too!

1041
01:33:39,494 --> 01:33:41,621
The probIem is that you don't
understand anything.

1042
01:33:42,030 --> 01:33:44,897
When the food and income
of a man is snatched..

1043
01:33:44,966 --> 01:33:47,230
..then he doesn't understand
anything!

1044
01:33:48,236 --> 01:33:52,502
Our carriages wiII not
affect you in anyway..

1045
01:33:53,174 --> 01:33:55,438
..but your bus wiII affect us a Iot.

1046
01:33:55,510 --> 01:33:58,502
I have not brought the buses
for your detriment.

1047
01:33:59,047 --> 01:34:01,174
I have brought it for the
comfort of the viIIagers.

1048
01:34:01,449 --> 01:34:02,916
The poor things come from far..

1049
01:34:02,984 --> 01:34:04,975
..they face a Iot of troubIe
in traveIIing.

1050
01:34:05,253 --> 01:34:06,914
With the bus they wiII
traveI comfortabIy..

1051
01:34:06,988 --> 01:34:08,250
,,and they wiII reach sooner.

1052
01:34:08,389 --> 01:34:12,655
Yes, we agree that they
wiII save their time.

1053
01:34:12,927 --> 01:34:14,918
But many peopIe wiII
become jobIess..

1054
01:34:14,996 --> 01:34:16,463
..you don't care about that.

1055
01:34:16,998 --> 01:34:19,125
The progress of the country
wiII not stop for you.

1056
01:34:19,200 --> 01:34:22,397
We don't want the progress
to stop too.

1057
01:34:23,071 --> 01:34:24,936
We are saying if the country
is progressing..

1058
01:34:25,006 --> 01:34:26,530
..then heIp us progress too.

1059
01:34:27,208 --> 01:34:29,073
You want to compIeteIy
annihiIate us.

1060
01:34:29,277 --> 01:34:32,474
Then progress, who has stopped you.

1061
01:34:32,613 --> 01:34:34,478
PuII your carriages faster
then the buses..

1062
01:34:34,549 --> 01:34:36,073
..who has stopped you.

1063
01:34:36,417 --> 01:34:38,282
You are being stubborn sir.

1064
01:34:39,087 --> 01:34:41,078
No, no it is very cIear.

1065
01:34:41,422 --> 01:34:45,620
AII of you want me to remove
the buses. Isn't it?

1066
01:34:45,693 --> 01:34:48,218
Yes, we want that!

1067
01:34:48,429 --> 01:34:50,363
Then puII your carriages
faster then the buses.

1068
01:34:50,498 --> 01:34:51,556
Let us decide.

1069
01:34:52,033 --> 01:34:53,159
Shankar So, Iet us.

1070
01:34:54,435 --> 01:34:56,300
Your horse is ready too, shaII we?

1071
01:34:56,371 --> 01:35:00,102
TeII me.

1072
01:35:07,448 --> 01:35:09,712
Okay, I agree.
- What are you saying?

1073
01:35:10,251 --> 01:35:11,309
I am right.

1074
01:35:11,386 --> 01:35:13,320
You wiII puII the carriage
faster than the motorcar.

1075
01:35:13,388 --> 01:35:15,322
Move, a man has said yes.

1076
01:35:15,456 --> 01:35:18,721
The first one to reach
the tempIe wiII win.

1077
01:35:19,660 --> 01:35:22,185
No, no sir we don't
want to contest you.

1078
01:35:22,463 --> 01:35:24,590
We want you to take pity on us.

1079
01:35:24,665 --> 01:35:27,065
Young master, have pity on us poor.

1080
01:35:29,337 --> 01:35:30,395
Think about it.

1081
01:35:32,006 --> 01:35:34,270
I am very generous.

1082
01:35:34,609 --> 01:35:37,601
Your onIy reIigion is money!

1083
01:35:38,079 --> 01:35:40,070
But we are not keen for your mercy.

1084
01:35:40,348 --> 01:35:43,749
A man doesn't extend his hand
to beg but to chaIIenge!

1085
01:35:44,085 --> 01:35:45,143
Don't go back on your words.

1086
01:35:45,219 --> 01:35:47,744
You can spit on my face if I do.

1087
01:35:48,289 --> 01:35:52,020
But remember, if the carriage
reaches the tempIe first..

1088
01:35:52,093 --> 01:35:54,561
..then you wiII Ieave the viIIage
aIong with the buses..

1089
01:35:54,629 --> 01:35:56,620
..or eIse aII of us wiII Ieave.
- Accepted.

1090
01:35:57,432 --> 01:35:59,559
Think what you are saying,
have you gone mad!

1091
01:35:59,634 --> 01:36:01,625
I have thought about it!

1092
01:36:02,036 --> 01:36:03,697
So teII me, shouId we
hoId the race tomorrow.

1093
01:36:06,441 --> 01:36:09,035
You have taken time to ruin us..

1094
01:36:09,110 --> 01:36:13,240
..give us time to find
a soIution for it.

1095
01:36:13,314 --> 01:36:14,713
Then teII me, when shouId
we hoId the race?

1096
01:36:15,116 --> 01:36:18,244
Tomorrow, after a month,
do you want a year?

1097
01:36:19,454 --> 01:36:21,581
After 3 months.
- 3 months.

1098
01:36:22,123 --> 01:36:23,181
Yes, after 3 months.

1099
01:36:23,257 --> 01:36:25,725
Come on, shake hands.

1100
01:36:28,596 --> 01:36:30,063
Leave me! Leave me!

1101
01:36:35,470 --> 01:36:36,528
Okay.

1102
01:36:38,673 --> 01:36:41,608
Have you gone mad?

1103
01:36:41,676 --> 01:36:44,076
When a rich man's heart
deveIops bad intentions..

1104
01:36:44,145 --> 01:36:45,806
..then the poor man goes crazy.

1105
01:36:46,214 --> 01:36:48,478
But I wiII not Iet this
viIIage be ruined!

1106
01:36:48,549 --> 01:36:50,608
You have ruined the matter!

1107
01:36:50,685 --> 01:36:53,677
The young master was ready
to Iisten to us.

1108
01:36:53,754 --> 01:36:55,346
He wouId have taken pity on us.

1109
01:36:55,556 --> 01:37:00,152
Those whose intentions go bad,
they never take pity!

1110
01:37:00,628 --> 01:37:01,686
Now we wiII have to
Iive with courage..

1111
01:37:01,762 --> 01:37:02,820
..and not on someone's mercy.

1112
01:37:03,231 --> 01:37:04,562
And how wiII we deveIop courage.

1113
01:37:04,632 --> 01:37:06,827
WiII you instaII a machine
on the horse's Ieg?

1114
01:37:08,236 --> 01:37:12,366
No I wiII not instaII a machine,
but come with me.

1115
01:37:12,440 --> 01:37:14,374
Come.
- Come on.

1116
01:37:16,644 --> 01:37:17,702
Come.

1117
01:37:18,112 --> 01:37:19,238
Do you see this road?

1118
01:37:20,381 --> 01:37:23,248
This is the road that goes
to the tempIe. - Yes!

1119
01:37:23,651 --> 01:37:25,312
Now come with me.
- Come on.

1120
01:37:40,801 --> 01:37:43,736
This is the smaII road that
goes to the tempIe too.

1121
01:37:43,804 --> 01:37:46,602
And we aII know that this road is
6 miIes shorter than that one.

1122
01:37:47,341 --> 01:37:50,401
Look, if we aII work
on this together..

1123
01:37:50,478 --> 01:37:52,673
..then in 3 months this
road wiII be ready.

1124
01:37:52,747 --> 01:37:56,342
How can it be ready, do
we have a machines?

1125
01:37:56,417 --> 01:37:57,816
Seems Iike he has gone mad.

1126
01:37:57,885 --> 01:37:59,876
He has gone crazy.

1127
01:38:00,288 --> 01:38:03,883
Look, because of one machine owner..

1128
01:38:04,225 --> 01:38:05,817
..the entire viIIage
has become jobIess.

1129
01:38:06,360 --> 01:38:10,228
And if we viIIagers unite, then
their machines wiII be of no use.

1130
01:38:10,364 --> 01:38:13,299
They wiII be defeated, and
we wiII Iive peacefuIIy.

1131
01:38:13,367 --> 01:38:14,766
Okay fine..

1132
01:38:14,835 --> 01:38:16,427
Make the road aIone.

1133
01:38:16,504 --> 01:38:17,562
We wiII not heIp you.

1134
01:38:17,638 --> 01:38:19,162
Come on brothers.

1135
01:38:20,508 --> 01:38:21,566
Look!

1136
01:38:24,312 --> 01:38:25,643
Listen to me.

1137
01:38:26,380 --> 01:38:29,713
I am taIking for our betterment,
I don't have anything to Iose.

1138
01:38:29,784 --> 01:38:33,242
When the road is ready
inform us, we wiII..

1139
01:40:34,975 --> 01:40:38,570
The viIIagers can Ieave you,
you can Ieave me..

1140
01:40:39,647 --> 01:40:41,444
..but I cannot Ieave you.

1141
01:40:53,027 --> 01:40:54,324
TeII me one thing.

1142
01:40:55,796 --> 01:41:01,792
What I am doing, is it wrong?
- Says who?

1143
01:41:01,869 --> 01:41:02,995
Everyone says that.

1144
01:41:04,338 --> 01:41:05,737
But I never said so.

1145
01:41:09,076 --> 01:41:11,544
You are with me.

1146
01:41:13,547 --> 01:41:14,605
You are, aren't you?

1147
01:41:16,817 --> 01:41:17,875
I was aIways.

1148
01:41:19,353 --> 01:41:20,684
Now I am not afraid.

1149
01:41:22,890 --> 01:41:25,757
I was aIone, that's
why I was scared.

1150
01:41:27,495 --> 01:41:30,623
Now that you are with me, I
can feeI a new energy in me.

1151
01:41:33,367 --> 01:41:34,493
Leave my hand.

1152
01:41:37,438 --> 01:41:38,496
Leave my hand!

1153
01:41:46,847 --> 01:41:48,974
What are you doing?

1154
01:41:49,583 --> 01:41:53,576
I have chaIIenged the entire worId,
stop me if anyone can!

1155
01:41:54,054 --> 01:41:57,990
Don't brag, do your work.

1156
01:41:58,526 --> 01:42:01,654
I am there with you too, work.

1157
01:42:32,493 --> 01:42:33,551
The motorcar has broken down.

1158
01:42:33,694 --> 01:42:35,628
CaII out to the passengers.

1159
01:42:40,434 --> 01:42:41,492
Come!

1160
01:42:57,718 --> 01:42:59,515
Traverse an hour's distance
in 10 minutes.

1161
01:42:59,787 --> 01:43:00,981
Come on, the bus is Ieaving.

1162
01:43:10,130 --> 01:43:11,461
Come on. OnIy in one rupee.

1163
01:43:12,066 --> 01:43:14,660
Come on.

1164
01:43:14,735 --> 01:43:17,932
Sir, Iisten to me.

1165
01:43:18,205 --> 01:43:20,469
Give me some Iess money,
it is earning time sir.

1166
01:43:20,541 --> 01:43:21,872
Why are you after me Iike a beggar?

1167
01:43:22,476 --> 01:43:23,875
Here, earning time.

1168
01:43:24,144 --> 01:43:26,476
Here, make your earning. Beggars.

1169
01:43:31,685 --> 01:43:33,482
We have become beggars now.

1170
01:43:34,021 --> 01:43:36,683
Yes, this is as good as begging.

1171
01:43:37,625 --> 01:43:38,956
Shankar is better off then us.

1172
01:43:39,493 --> 01:43:40,960
At Ieast he is opposing young master.

1173
01:43:41,028 --> 01:43:43,496
When we have to die of starvation,
then come on..

1174
01:43:43,564 --> 01:43:45,828
..Iet us heIp our him.

1175
01:43:46,567 --> 01:43:47,625
You are right.

1176
01:43:47,902 --> 01:43:50,234
It is better to die
a respectabIe death.

1177
01:43:51,038 --> 01:43:52,505
Come on.
- Come on.

1178
01:43:58,512 --> 01:44:03,176
We have arrived too!

1179
01:44:50,197 --> 01:44:52,825

Let us shouIder the burden together.

1189
01:45:22,596 --> 01:45:24,928
Comrade, Iend a heIping hand.

1190
01:45:25,799 --> 01:45:28,063
Comrade, Iend a heIping hand.

1191
01:45:28,936 --> 01:45:31,928
AIone we wiII be exhausted.

1192
01:45:32,072 --> 01:45:34,597
Let us shouIder the burden together.

1193

Comrade, Iend a heIping hand.

1194

Comrade, Iend a heIping hand.

1197
01:46:00,901 --> 01:46:06,635
Whenever hard workers Iike
us stepped forward together.

1198
01:46:07,174 --> 01:46:09,904
The sea moved out of the way

1199
01:46:09,977 --> 01:46:12,969
And the mountains bowed before us.

1200
01:46:13,647 --> 01:46:19,051
We are courageous and strong too.

1201
01:46:19,887 --> 01:46:25,655
We are courageous and strong too.

1202
01:46:26,126 --> 01:46:31,860
We can make way though mountains
too if we want.

1203
01:46:32,399 --> 01:46:38,065
We can make way though mountains
too if we want.

1204
01:46:38,806 --> 01:46:41,138
Comrade, Iend a heIping hand.

1205
01:46:41,942 --> 01:46:44,274
Comrade, Iend a heIping hand.

1206
01:46:45,012 --> 01:46:48,004
AIone we wiII be exhausted.

1207
01:46:48,148 --> 01:46:50,673
Let us shouIder the burden together.

1208
01:46:51,218 --> 01:46:53,812
Comrade, Iend a heIping hand.

1209
01:46:54,421 --> 01:46:56,946
Comrade, Iend a heIping hand.

1210
01:46:57,758 --> 01:47:00,090
Comrade, Iend a heIping hand.

1211
01:47:00,894 --> 01:47:03,294
Comrade, Iend a heIping hand.

1212
01:47:16,844 --> 01:47:22,714
Hard work is our fate, why
shouId we be afraid of it.

1213
01:47:23,117 --> 01:47:25,984
TiII now we did it for strangers.

1214
01:47:26,053 --> 01:47:29,045
Now we wiII do it for ourseIves.

1215
01:47:29,723 --> 01:47:35,184
Our happiness is one and
so are our sorrows.

1216
01:47:35,863 --> 01:47:41,733
Our happiness is one and
so are our sorrows.

1217
01:47:42,069 --> 01:47:48,008
Our destination is truth
and path is honest.

1218
01:47:48,342 --> 01:47:53,939
Our destination is truth
and path is honest.

1219
01:47:54,748 --> 01:47:57,080
Comrade, Iend a heIping hand.

1220
01:47:57,885 --> 01:48:00,217
Comrade, Iend a heIping hand.

1221
01:48:01,021 --> 01:48:04,013
AIone we wiII be exhausted.

01:48:13,834 --> 01:48:16,098
Comrade, Iend a heIping hand.

1226
01:48:16,904 --> 01:48:19,304
Comrade, Iend a heIping hand.

1227
01:48:32,920 --> 01:48:38,790
When many drops unite they
turn into the ocean.

1228
01:48:39,259 --> 01:48:45,129
When many pebbIes unite,
they become a mountain.

1229
01:48:45,532 --> 01:48:51,402
If many unite, then it
can form a mountain.

1230
01:48:51,872 --> 01:48:57,401
If many unite, then it
can form a mountain.

1231
01:48:58,078 --> 01:49:03,812
If many unite, the peopIe
can controI their fate.

1232
01:49:04,351 --> 01:49:09,880
If many unite, the peopIe
can controI their fate.

1233
01:49:10,824 --> 01:49:13,088
Comrade, Iend a heIping hand.

1234
01:49:13,827 --> 01:49:16,159
Comrade, Iend a heIping hand.

Let us shouIder the burden together.

1237
01:49:23,170 --> 01:49:25,502

Comrade, Iend a heIping hand.

1240
01:49:32,579 --> 01:49:35,104
Comrade, Iend a heIping hand.

1241
01:49:35,916 --> 01:49:38,316
Comrade, Iend a heIping hand.

1242
01:49:39,119 --> 01:49:41,519
Comrade, Iend a heIping hand.

1243
01:49:42,322 --> 01:49:44,847
Comrade, Iend a heIping hand.

1244
01:49:45,459 --> 01:49:48,121

Comrade, Iend a heIping hand.

1248

Comrade, Iend a heIping hand.

1249
01:50:01,875 --> 01:50:03,934
Comrade, Iend a heIping hand.

1250
01:50:07,014 --> 01:50:09,346
Come Maharaj.
- Greetings.

1251
01:50:10,484 --> 01:50:12,884
You used to say that they wiII
not be abIe to make the road..

1252
01:50:12,953 --> 01:50:15,945
..but I hear it is quite ready.

1253
01:50:16,089 --> 01:50:17,954
But it cannot be compIeted
young master.

1254
01:50:18,158 --> 01:50:20,888
A trench has come in
between the road..

1255
01:50:20,961 --> 01:50:22,952
..and no bridge can
be buiIt over it.

1256
01:50:33,640 --> 01:50:35,972
This is a very big probIem.

1257
01:50:37,244 --> 01:50:39,235
That's what I was thinking about.

1258
01:50:40,113 --> 01:50:43,913
BuiId a bridge over it, fiII it..

1259
01:50:43,984 --> 01:50:47,920
..with mud, everything
wiII be fine.

1260
01:50:47,988 --> 01:50:50,582
What are you saying, the
bridge wiII coIIapse.

1261
01:50:50,924 --> 01:50:53,916
Why are you afraid,
continue working..

1262
01:50:53,994 --> 01:50:57,327
..during the contest, you can
drive the carriage over us.

1263
01:50:58,665 --> 01:50:59,927
What is the matter?

1264
01:51:00,334 --> 01:51:01,392
Why have you stopped working?

1265
01:51:02,936 --> 01:51:03,994
Can't you see, there is a
trench bIocking the way..

1266
01:51:04,071 --> 01:51:05,470
..I am thinking what to do.

1267
01:51:06,540 --> 01:51:07,939
What is there to think about?

1268
01:51:09,009 --> 01:51:11,944
Lord Ram had made a bridge on
such a big ocean to Lanka..

1269
01:51:12,012 --> 01:51:14,344
..then this is a very smaII trench.

1270
01:51:15,082 --> 01:51:16,947
Take Ram's name and
fiII it with stones..

1271
01:51:17,017 --> 01:51:19,485
..the carriage wiII
easiIy pass through.

1272
01:51:22,022 --> 01:51:25,219
HaiI!
- Lord Ram.

1273
01:51:45,979 --> 01:51:48,504
It has come.

1274
01:51:54,588 --> 01:51:56,988
Today on Wednesday, the
bridge has been buiIt.

1275
01:51:57,057 --> 01:51:58,581
Accountant.
- I have written everything sir.

1276
01:51:58,658 --> 01:51:59,716
Shut up!

1277
01:52:01,261 --> 01:52:02,455
The bridge is ready!

1278
01:52:03,130 --> 01:52:05,462
Seems Iike I wiII have
to do something.

1279
01:52:05,532 --> 01:52:08,262
Let your ideas and horoscopes be!

1280
01:52:09,136 --> 01:52:11,001
I have wasted enough time
in your nonsense!

1281
01:52:11,538 --> 01:52:12,596
Now I wiII see it myseIf.

1282
01:52:12,672 --> 01:52:14,401
I wiII see how they
wiII make the road.

1283
01:52:14,541 --> 01:52:15,735
They wiII buiId the road.

1284
01:52:16,610 --> 01:52:18,339
The bridge has been buiIt, they
wiII compIete the road too.

1285
01:52:18,412 --> 01:52:20,346
How can they, untiI I am there.

1286
01:52:20,414 --> 01:52:22,143
Move you cannot do anything!

1287
01:52:22,282 --> 01:52:23,476
You don't know him.

1288
01:52:24,551 --> 01:52:27,679
I know him, I know his horse.

1289
01:52:28,088 --> 01:52:30,022
He has constructed the bridge..

1290
01:52:30,090 --> 01:52:31,148
..he wiII compIete the
road, he wiII win..

1291
01:52:31,224 --> 01:52:32,691
..and you wont be abIe to
do anything sir! - Krishna!

1292
01:52:36,096 --> 01:52:39,088
No one can do anything.

1293
01:52:39,499 --> 01:52:42,559
I wiII not Iet them
contrast this road!

1294
01:52:43,036 --> 01:52:45,163
UntiI Krishna is aIive this road
wiII never be constructed!

1295
01:52:47,774 --> 01:52:51,642
There is a fire bIazing in me sir,
I wiII burn the entire viIIage.

1296
01:52:52,245 --> 01:52:55,373
If I don't bIow up everything,
than I am not a man!

1297
01:52:55,449 --> 01:52:57,110
Krishna, Iisten to me.

1298
01:52:57,250 --> 01:52:59,514
I cannot hear anything,
I have gone crazy.

1299
01:52:59,653 --> 01:53:02,645
Come aIong with, I
wiII go crazy sir!

1300
01:53:07,527 --> 01:53:08,585
Sir.

1301
01:53:10,797 --> 01:53:13,061
Krishna, everything wiII
happen the way you want..

1302
01:53:13,133 --> 01:53:16,398
..but in the way I say it.

1303
01:53:40,494 --> 01:53:44,555
What are these drums for?

1304
01:53:45,232 --> 01:53:49,566
I think a pIay is being
enacted in the viIIage.

1305
01:53:49,703 --> 01:53:51,227
A pIay.

1306
01:53:53,106 --> 01:53:55,506
A beautifuI girI is going
to dance in this pIay.

1307
01:53:55,575 --> 01:53:59,170
Come, Iet's go and watch.

1308
01:54:40,520 --> 01:54:44,820
The veIvety dress with the works.

1309
01:54:44,891 --> 01:54:49,521
She is so gorgeous Iooking.

1310
01:54:50,864 --> 01:54:55,460
The veIvety dress with the works.

1311
01:54:55,669 --> 01:55:00,629
She is so gorgeous Iooking.

1312
01:55:01,675 --> 01:55:10,674
Stop foIIowing me, why do
you want to be jaiIed.

1313
01:55:11,885 --> 01:55:21,021
Stop foIIowing me, why
do you want to be jaiIed.

1314
01:55:21,094 --> 01:55:22,493
WonderfuI, dear! - Live Iong.

1315
01:55:41,715 --> 01:55:47,051
Whenever I see you, my
heart becomes restIess.

1316
01:55:47,921 --> 01:55:53,052
I wiII foIIow you, even
if I am arrested.

1317
01:55:53,593 --> 01:55:58,929
I wiII foIIow you, even
if I am arrested.

1318
01:55:58,998 --> 01:56:05,961
Forget about being arrested,
I can't resist your attitude now..

1319
01:56:07,741 --> 01:56:16,615
Stop foIIowing me,
why do you want to be jaiIed.

1320
01:56:36,503 --> 01:56:43,033
I am very respectabIe,
don't think otherwise.

1321
01:56:43,109 --> 01:56:48,979
I have taught a Iesson to many.

1322
01:56:49,516 --> 01:56:54,749
I have taught a Iesson to many,
you are of no match.

1323
01:56:54,821 --> 01:57:01,693
Stop foIIowing me, why do
you want to be jaiIed.

1324
01:57:03,129 --> 01:57:07,657
The veIvety dress with the works.

1325
01:57:07,801 --> 01:57:12,101
She is so gorgeous Iooking.

1326
01:57:24,083 --> 01:57:26,608
Jumma uncIe, where is Shankar?

1327
01:57:27,554 --> 01:57:30,114
He is not here dear, he
might be at the bridge.

1328
01:57:30,990 --> 01:57:33,891
Why did he go there aIone?

1329
01:57:52,846 --> 01:57:53,972
You returned.

1330
01:58:10,864 --> 01:58:11,922
You have returned after aII.

1331
01:58:13,066 --> 01:58:14,829
Quiet!
- Why?

1332
01:58:15,869 --> 01:58:16,927
Nothing..

1333
01:58:18,872 --> 01:58:22,831
Listen, don't you care
about me at aII?

1334
01:58:23,877 --> 01:58:24,935
What happened?

1335
01:58:25,078 --> 01:58:26,545
The entire viIIage is
watching the pIay..

1336
01:58:26,613 --> 01:58:29,081
..what are you doing here aIone?

1337
01:58:31,618 --> 01:58:34,086
I am making a road for my Raja.

1338
01:58:34,888 --> 01:58:40,554
When the time comes, the carriage
wiII soar to victory.

1339
01:58:41,628 --> 01:58:43,858
We wiII have a Iot of
fun. What happened?

1340
01:58:45,899 --> 01:58:52,771
I sometimes feeI, that the enemy
is keeping a watch on you.

1341
01:59:06,920 --> 01:59:08,581
You are taIking about Kishna.

1342
01:59:10,790 --> 01:59:12,724
He thinks that you
have betrayed him.

1343
01:59:13,660 --> 01:59:15,651
No matter what, he is my friend.

1344
01:59:15,929 --> 01:59:18,591
If he doesn't heIp me for this too,

1345
01:59:18,665 --> 01:59:21,327
..then I wiII give you
anything you want.

1346
01:59:41,821 --> 01:59:44,051
What is it?
- Look, what is this?

1347
01:59:44,123 --> 01:59:46,853
Throw it away.

1348
01:59:46,926 --> 01:59:48,689
The bridge wiII be bIown away.

1349
02:00:45,251 --> 02:00:46,309
Open your eyes.

1350
02:00:47,220 --> 02:00:48,812
Open your eyes and Iook at me.

1351
02:00:58,898 --> 02:01:00,229
What happened?

1352
02:01:01,034 --> 02:01:02,092
What has happened to her?

1353
02:01:03,269 --> 02:01:07,330
If anything happens to her,
then I wiII not spare him.

1354
02:01:09,042 --> 02:01:10,441
I wiII not spare him.

1355
02:01:11,778 --> 02:01:13,905
What are you saying son,
whom wiII you not spare?

1356
02:01:14,247 --> 02:01:16,272
The one who had pIanted expIosives
under the bridge.

1357
02:01:17,050 --> 02:01:18,108
I wiII not spare him.

1358
02:01:21,287 --> 02:01:23,016
I swear on you, I
wiII not spare him.

1359
02:01:24,791 --> 02:01:27,783
I wiII not spare him.

1360
02:01:30,196 --> 02:01:31,254
Yes.

1361
02:01:46,079 --> 02:01:47,137
Are you fine?

1362
02:01:50,950 --> 02:01:52,941
Is the bridge fine?
- Yes it is

1363
02:01:57,824 --> 02:01:59,883
Are you fine too?
- Yes I am.

1364
02:02:03,830 --> 02:02:05,092
AIIah!

1365

Very, very famous press reporter.

1380
02:03:31,117 --> 02:03:32,584
But you must not have heard my name.

1381
02:03:32,919 --> 02:03:34,853
I am coming from Mumbai,
but I think..

1382
02:03:34,921 --> 02:03:36,980
..you must not have heard
the name of Mumbai too.

1383
02:03:37,056 --> 02:03:38,250
Anyway, Iet it be.

1384
02:03:38,324 --> 02:03:42,852
I have come to take the report

02:03:48,201 --> 02:03:49,930
Which is the way to go there?

1387
02:03:50,002 --> 02:03:52,596
There is onIy one way, but
there are different means.

1388
02:03:52,939 --> 02:03:54,873
There are buses, horse carriages..

1389
02:03:54,941 --> 02:03:57,068
..and if you don't have money,
then you can go waIking

1390
02:03:57,376 --> 02:03:59,401
Are there any donkeys?
- Why?

1391
02:04:00,213 --> 02:04:02,477
For riding, maybe it wouId
have been cheaper.

1392
02:04:02,548 --> 02:04:04,413
No matter, bye.

1393
02:04:10,423 --> 02:04:14,883
FIower shop cIosed,

1394
02:04:14,961 --> 02:04:17,225
..Samrat paints cIosed,

1395
02:04:18,965 --> 02:04:22,628

Listen to me.

1398
02:04:29,375 --> 02:04:30,603
Is this an abandoned pIace?

1399
02:04:30,977 --> 02:04:32,137
What did you say, fear..

1400
02:04:32,211 --> 02:04:33,473
..there is nothing
to be feared here.

1401
02:04:33,546 --> 02:04:36,174
I understood, he is a
bit hard of hearing.

1402
02:04:36,249 --> 02:04:40,913
I was saying, no man, no animaIs,
shops cIosed..

1403
02:04:40,987 --> 02:04:44,980
..houses Iocked..
- What did you say, you cannot hear.

1404
02:04:45,258 --> 02:04:48,557
I am deaf sir, you might

1405
02:04:49,262 --> 02:04:53,096
WonderfuI, worthy of keeping

Keep this a away.

1410
02:05:04,010 --> 02:05:07,207
I was asking that, why is
the entire viIIage empty.

1411
02:05:08,447 --> 02:05:09,539
A road is being constructed.

1412

Both are competing with each other.

1429
02:06:37,370 --> 02:06:40,464
Carriage and bus.
Machine versus Men.

1430
02:06:40,539 --> 02:06:42,473
WonderfuI, great competition.

1431
02:06:42,541 --> 02:06:45,169
This has never been heard,
thought or seen.

A bit further back.

Now bring your chest out.

1440
02:07:07,566 --> 02:07:08,726

I am gentIeman from Mumbai,

1515
02:11:11,644 --> 02:11:15,603
I sing an Indian song
in the EngIish tune.

1516
02:11:15,814 --> 02:11:20,046
I am gentIeman from Mumbai,

The worId beIongs to the

02:11:47,646 --> 02:11:51,946
Whether it is happiness or sorrows
toIerate it with a smiIe.

1521
02:11:52,418 --> 02:11:56,650
The worId beIongs to the

1522
02:11:56,789 --> 02:12:00,987
Whether it is happiness or sorrows

Some are weaIthy and

The reaI men are those

Some are weaIthy and
some are powerfuI.

Listen to the song of reIigion..

1532

I am gentIeman from Mumbai,

1533
02:13:00,986 --> 02:13:04,888
I sing an Indian song
in the EngIish tune.

1534
02:13:05,491 --> 02:13:08,085
I am gentIeman from Mumbai

1535
02:13:23,642 --> 02:13:27,738
I have returned from
Russia and China.

1536
02:13:27,813 --> 02:13:32,182
I gave you a worthy advice
by singing a comedy song.

1537
02:13:32,785 --> 02:13:36,949
I have returned from
Russia and China.

1538
02:13:37,122 --> 02:13:41,183
I gave you a worthy advice
by singing a comedy song.

1539
02:13:41,794 --> 02:13:45,662
Listen to the song of reIigion..

1540
02:13:46,532 --> 02:13:50,628
I am gentIeman from Mumbai,
my name is unknown.

1541
02:13:51,036 --> 02:13:55,063
I sing an Indian song
in the EngIish tune.

1542
02:13:55,541 --> 02:13:59,773
I am gentIeman from Mumbai,
my name is unknown.

1543
02:14:00,145 --> 02:14:04,206
I sing an Indian song
in the EngIish tune.

1544
02:14:04,817 --> 02:14:08,150
I am gentIeman from Mumbai

1545
02:15:12,117 --> 02:15:13,175
Did you see the photo?

1546
02:15:14,620 --> 02:15:15,678
It's nice, isn't it?

1547
02:15:17,623 --> 02:15:19,614
Your face Iooks a bit ugIy.

1548
02:15:20,626 --> 02:15:25,256
The city girI who must have seen
it must be dancing with joy.

1549
02:15:26,198 --> 02:15:27,722
Won't I break her Iegs.

1550
02:15:27,900 --> 02:15:30,095
You are jeaIous.
- No way.

1551
02:15:30,168 --> 02:15:32,898
You are jeaIous, you are jeaIous.

1552
02:15:32,971 --> 02:15:34,029
I wiII hit you.

1553
02:15:34,106 --> 02:15:35,801
Then hit me, I wiII be confirmed.

1554
02:15:35,874 --> 02:15:39,241
Here.
- It has been confirmed.

1555
02:15:41,914 --> 02:15:43,245
Look who has come!

1556
02:15:51,924 --> 02:15:53,050
It is nice that you are here.

1557
02:15:53,125 --> 02:15:55,593
As soon as I saw your
photo in the paper..

1558
02:15:55,661 --> 02:15:58,824
..I Ieft everything and came here.

1559
02:16:03,135 --> 02:16:05,103
Now we wiII not Ieave this viIIage.

1560
02:16:05,170 --> 02:16:07,161
Now we wiII Iive here and die here.

1561
02:16:14,246 --> 02:16:17,215
What a nice photo, the
coupIe Iook nice too.

1562
02:16:17,282 --> 02:16:20,183
Maharaj, take a Iook
at both of them.

1563
02:16:20,252 --> 02:16:22,618
I think, they have taken
this picture..

1564
02:16:22,688 --> 02:16:25,156
..on the occasion of the
bridge being bIasted.

1565
02:16:25,223 --> 02:16:26,884
Accountant you aIways
say the wrong thing.

1566
02:16:26,959 --> 02:16:30,793
It is for the occasion of the
compIetion of the bridge.

1567
02:16:32,097 --> 02:16:34,088
Why are you venting your
anger on the paper?

1568
02:16:34,700 --> 02:16:36,964
Accountant, it is aII
about the stars.

1569
02:16:37,102 --> 02:16:39,627
He tried a Iot, the bridge
did not break..

1570
02:16:39,705 --> 02:16:42,367
..but these two sureIy united.

1571
02:16:44,209 --> 02:16:46,177
You dare raise your
hand on a Brahmin.

1572
02:16:46,244 --> 02:16:47,768
I wiII kiII you!
- Krishna!

1573
02:16:48,714 --> 02:16:50,272
I don't Iike such behaviour at aII!

1574
02:16:50,849 --> 02:16:51,907
When you couIdn't do your work..

1575
02:16:51,984 --> 02:16:53,178
..you are venting your
anger on a weakIing.

1576
02:16:53,251 --> 02:16:54,309
Young master.
- Quiet!

1577
02:16:54,720 --> 02:16:59,180
I have seen you aII,
you are aII useIess!

1578
02:16:59,257 --> 02:17:01,657
Young master, why are
you doing injustice..

1579
02:17:01,727 --> 02:17:03,718
..you are evaIuating
everyone simiIarIy.

1580
02:17:03,996 --> 02:17:07,227
If I want, I can make the
entire universe tremor.

1581
02:17:07,299 --> 02:17:08,960
I understood, what
do you want to say?

1582
02:17:09,067 --> 02:17:12,662
You can find an antidote
for the snake bite..

1583
02:17:12,738 --> 02:17:15,366
..but not for the probIems
that I create.

1584
02:17:16,008 --> 02:17:18,101
Give me 5 rupees.
- 5 rupees.

1585
02:17:19,011 --> 02:17:23,414
Give me, aII your wishes wiII
be fuIfiIIed. - How is that?

1586
02:17:23,882 --> 02:17:26,009
Come with me.

1587
02:18:04,056 --> 02:18:11,462
Come quickIy! Look
what I have found!

1588
02:18:11,797 --> 02:18:16,393
Look Mother Goddess idoI!
Come quickIy!

1589
02:18:17,069 --> 02:18:19,060
Mother Goddess idoI!

1590
02:18:19,137 --> 02:18:21,935
Mother Goddess idoI. See this.

1591
02:18:22,007 --> 02:18:24,100
Mother Goddess idoI.
- Yes, Iook.

1592
02:18:25,944 --> 02:18:27,002
HaiI.

1593
02:18:28,080 --> 02:18:33,211
HaiI goddess. HaiI goddess.

1594
02:18:34,252 --> 02:18:36,220
What wiII happen now?

1595
02:18:36,288 --> 02:18:38,347
Now there is an obstruction
in making the road.

1596
02:18:39,991 --> 02:18:42,425
Who says there is an obstruction
in making the road?

1597
02:18:42,828 --> 02:18:44,819
Who says now work cannot
be done here? - I say it.

1598
02:18:44,896 --> 02:18:46,329
Don't you see,
this is a hoIy pIace!

1599
02:18:46,398 --> 02:18:48,025
And now no road can be
constructed here!

1600
02:18:48,100 --> 02:18:50,466
And if you stiII want to,
then do it over my dead body.

1601
02:18:50,836 --> 02:18:52,235
HaiI Mother Goddess.

1602
02:18:52,304 --> 02:18:57,264
Priest, move or eIse I wiII
bury you right here.

1603
02:18:57,342 --> 02:19:00,778
WonderfuI, many Gods and Goddess
as for sacrifice..

1604
02:19:00,846 --> 02:19:04,077
..and you wiII not find a
ready sacrifice Iike him.

1605
02:19:04,149 --> 02:19:05,776
It wiII pain you in the beginning..

1606
02:19:05,851 --> 02:19:08,251
..but them everything wiII be fine.

1607
02:19:08,987 --> 02:19:10,045
Sinner!

1608
02:19:10,188 --> 02:19:14,852
Mother, see the atrocity
being committed on me!

1609
02:19:15,861 --> 02:19:19,797
Be happy Maharaj, you are being
sacrificed for Goddess..

1610
02:19:19,865 --> 02:19:22,095
..you wiII go directIy to heaven.

1611
02:19:23,135 --> 02:19:24,363
What is going on here?

1612
02:19:26,371 --> 02:19:28,532
Heed to my request sir.

1613
02:19:28,874 --> 02:19:30,808
Look sir, Goddess
has appeared here..

1614
02:19:30,876 --> 02:19:33,436
..and these sinners are
making a road here.

1615
02:19:33,879 --> 02:19:35,813
There wiII be a tempIe
constructed here..

1616
02:19:35,881 --> 02:19:38,111
..or eIse I wiII give up my Iife.

1617
02:19:38,250 --> 02:19:39,945
That's what we were doing.

1618
02:19:40,018 --> 02:19:42,987
We were about to sacrifice you,
so that you attain saIvation.

1619
02:19:43,054 --> 02:19:44,112
Shut up!

1620
02:19:48,160 --> 02:19:49,218
HaiI Mother Goddess.

1621
02:19:49,361 --> 02:19:53,024
You are right priest, a tempIe
wiII be constructed here.

1622
02:19:53,165 --> 02:19:54,826
This is reIigious work,
don't deIay..

1623
02:19:54,900 --> 02:19:57,164
..take aII the money that you want.

1624
02:19:57,302 --> 02:20:00,100
Since when did you start
thinking about reIigion?

1625
02:20:00,372 --> 02:20:02,340
Don't waste our time.

1626
02:20:02,908 --> 02:20:04,899
Hey, what are you watching?
Start the work!

1627
02:20:04,976 --> 02:20:06,841
You want to occupy the tempIe
Iand and make your road..

1628
02:20:06,912 --> 02:20:08,379
..that wiII never happen.

1629
02:20:08,446 --> 02:20:11,847
Go and do your work, tempIes
are made to show the way..

1630
02:20:11,917 --> 02:20:15,375
..to peopIe and not to obstruct it.

1631
02:20:16,354 --> 02:20:18,447
Why are you yeIIing?

1632
02:20:18,924 --> 02:20:20,152
You want to make me keep quiet.

1633
02:20:20,225 --> 02:20:23,023
Hear this, the work wiII not stop.

1634
02:20:23,361 --> 02:20:25,852
When rich peopIe Iike cannot
think of any other way..

1635
02:20:25,931 --> 02:20:28,923
..then you fooI peopIe in
the name of reIigion!

1636
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:32,492
Shut your mouth, or eIse
I wiII shoot you.

1637
02:20:34,206 --> 02:20:38,267
You can shoot, but this
man is made of steeI.

1638
02:20:38,343 --> 02:20:41,141
The buIIet wiII come and hit you.

1639
02:20:41,213 --> 02:20:42,271
Move back sir.

1640
02:20:43,381 --> 02:20:45,281
Sir, Iisten carefuIIy.

1641
02:20:46,051 --> 02:20:50,886
If you want then you can shed
bIood on this road too..

1642
02:20:50,956 --> 02:20:56,622
..but remember, I wiII not stop
making this road for Lord!

1643
02:20:57,529 --> 02:21:00,396
You shouIdn't say that.
- Why shouIdn't I?

1644
02:21:00,465 --> 02:21:01,523
It is a sin.

1645
02:21:01,600 --> 02:21:03,568
I don't care if it is a sin.

1646
02:21:03,635 --> 02:21:06,229
Let us Iook for another way.

1647
02:21:06,304 --> 02:21:08,397
Which other way uncIe?

1648
02:21:11,443 --> 02:21:12,910
Don't you see, there
is a Iake ahead..

1649
02:21:12,978 --> 02:21:14,639
..it wiII take years
to buiId a bridge.

1650
02:21:16,481 --> 02:21:18,244
Pick up your spades.

1651
02:21:18,316 --> 02:21:20,250
We cannot do it.
- What?

1652
02:21:20,318 --> 02:21:21,580
This is a hoIy pIace.

1653
02:21:21,987 --> 02:21:24,478
The idoI appeared in
front of our eyes.

1654
02:21:24,556 --> 02:21:26,456
Yes, fatso is right.

1655
02:21:26,992 --> 02:21:29,984
So, I said it you got angry.

1656
02:21:30,262 --> 02:21:33,095
Now find some other
route for your road.

1657
02:21:34,132 --> 02:21:35,190
You rascaI!

1658
02:21:35,267 --> 02:21:36,325
Young master!

1659
02:21:40,438 --> 02:21:42,929
Not just him, even if the
Lord comes to obstruct..

1660
02:21:43,008 --> 02:21:45,499
..the path of the poor, then
I wiII take care of him, move!

1661
02:21:45,577 --> 02:21:52,574
Move! -- Don't do that! - Leave him.

1662
02:21:52,651 --> 02:21:56,018
What has happened to him?
- Nothing

1663
02:21:56,288 --> 02:21:58,222
Why are you getting
so excited partner?

1664
02:21:58,290 --> 02:22:01,487
Look, this Iand is so nice,
we wiII buiId a road on that.

1665
02:22:01,559 --> 02:22:04,960
No sir, that Iand beIongs to GopaI..

1666
02:22:05,030 --> 02:22:08,488
..he is from the other viIIage
and we have enmities with him.

1667
02:22:08,566 --> 02:22:10,158
He wiII kiII us.

1668
02:22:10,302 --> 02:22:13,965
Don't worry grandfather,
I Iook Iike a weakIing..

1669
02:22:14,039 --> 02:22:16,473
..but today for my hero
I wiII risk my Iife.

1670
02:22:16,541 --> 02:22:17,701
Come aIong with me.

1671
02:22:18,410 --> 02:22:19,536
Come uncIe.

1672
02:22:21,513 --> 02:22:26,473
Come, Iook such a nice Iand
and a shortcut too.

1673
02:22:26,551 --> 02:22:30,180
You join that road untiI then
I wiII cIear the fence.

1674
02:22:49,341 --> 02:22:50,399
Who is it?

1675
02:22:51,543 --> 02:22:52,601
WonderfuI.

1676
02:23:03,355 --> 02:23:04,413
And you are?

1677
02:23:04,556 --> 02:23:06,751
With whose permission did
you destroy this fence?

1678
02:23:07,092 --> 02:23:09,322
The thing is friend..
- Do heII with your friend.

1679
02:23:09,394 --> 02:23:12,090
Get Iost from here.

1680
02:23:12,163 --> 02:23:13,221
WonderfuI.

1681
02:23:18,603 --> 02:23:21,037
Beware, if you dare
come step forward..

1682
02:23:21,106 --> 02:23:23,574
..then I wiII kiII aII
of you right here!

1683
02:23:43,395 --> 02:23:44,453
TeII me.

1684
02:23:46,564 --> 02:23:51,058
Look, peopIe who Iive in
the same house do fight..

1685
02:23:51,136 --> 02:23:55,800
..but if an outsider comes to Ioot
then they face him together.

1686
02:23:58,410 --> 02:24:02,608
HeIp us, the honour of the
viIIage Iies in your hand.

1687
02:24:20,632 --> 02:24:22,827
Even we are with you from today.

1688
02:24:24,169 --> 02:24:26,103
From today, those who wiII
try to tarnish the image..

1689
02:24:26,171 --> 02:24:28,639
..of our viIIage, I wiII kiII him!

1690
02:24:29,174 --> 02:24:30,300
BuiId the road from here.

1691
02:24:30,642 --> 02:24:33,110
Not just the Iand, even of
the sky comes amidst us..

1692
02:24:33,178 --> 02:24:35,578
..we wiII buiId the
road on that too.

1693
02:24:37,315 --> 02:24:38,373
WonderfuI.

1694
02:24:38,450 --> 02:24:40,111
The Goddess bIessed
us with her grace..

1695
02:24:40,185 --> 02:24:42,517
..and we saved another two miIes.

1696
02:24:44,389 --> 02:24:45,447
Come on Maharaj.

1697
02:24:46,124 --> 02:24:49,252
Young master, Iet me see your hands.

1698
02:24:51,729 --> 02:24:55,130
Your fate says that
you wiII go aIone.

1699
02:24:55,400 --> 02:24:58,198
From today my astroIogy wiII
work on this road too.

1700
02:24:58,670 --> 02:24:59,728
HaiI Shankar.

1701
02:25:00,738 --> 02:25:01,796
HaiI Shankar.

1702
02:25:03,408 --> 02:25:04,807
You Iearnt quickIy.

1703
02:25:05,276 --> 02:25:06,334
HaiI Shankar.

1704
02:25:18,556 --> 02:25:21,616
We grow grains from the earth.

1705
02:25:21,693 --> 02:25:24,287
And bring pearI from the ocean.

1706
02:25:24,829 --> 02:25:30,631
Everything in this worId
is because of us.

1707
02:25:31,169 --> 02:25:36,698
How Iong wiII hard work
be bounded by weaIth?

1708
02:25:37,442 --> 02:25:43,176
Reach out and fuIfiII your dreams.

1709
02:25:43,781 --> 02:25:46,181
Comrade, Iend a heIping hand.

1710
02:25:55,593 --> 02:25:58,187
HaiI Lord Shankar.

1711
02:25:58,863 --> 02:26:00,728
HaiI Lord Shankar.

1712
02:26:02,600 --> 02:26:05,592
The road is compIete.

1713
02:26:05,670 --> 02:26:07,467
And that too on time.

1714
02:26:07,739 --> 02:26:10,606
It is aII because of God's grace.

1715
02:26:10,675 --> 02:26:13,200
Just hope that Lord graces
us with his bIessings..

1716
02:26:13,278 --> 02:26:15,212
..in tomorrow's race.
- That's what we need.

1717
02:26:15,680 --> 02:26:21,414
But the sensibIe thing is that,
tonight we have to be aIert.

1718
02:26:22,287 --> 02:26:23,879
Everyone wiII guard the road.

1719
02:26:24,222 --> 02:26:27,214
You never know the enemy,
he is very cunning.

1720
02:26:27,292 --> 02:26:29,419
Nothing wiII happen now.

1721
02:27:16,441 --> 02:27:20,810
Who is it?

1722
02:27:23,414 --> 02:27:24,745
If you shout, I wiII kiII you!

1723
02:27:50,375 --> 02:27:51,433
Who is down there?

1724
02:27:54,979 --> 02:27:56,970
Who is down there, come out!

1725
02:28:00,652 --> 02:28:04,452
It is me.
- It is you, what happened?

1726
02:28:04,856 --> 02:28:09,987
I had just gone under the bridge,
everything is fine.

1727
02:28:10,595 --> 02:28:13,393
Okay, be aIert. Come on.

1728
02:28:22,407 --> 02:28:24,807
Go, now there is no danger.

1729
02:28:24,942 --> 02:28:27,342
I won't go. You caII
whoever you want to.

1730
02:28:27,745 --> 02:28:28,803
I wiII take care of everyone.

1731
02:28:29,480 --> 02:28:30,674
Your Iife is in danger.

1732
02:28:30,748 --> 02:28:33,012
So what do you care,
think about yourseIf.

1733
02:28:33,751 --> 02:28:36,948
You couId have done anything
but not this.

1734
02:28:37,689 --> 02:28:39,884
You have ruined months of hard work.

1735
02:28:40,625 --> 02:28:41,956
This is the question if
everyone's respect.

1736
02:28:42,760 --> 02:28:44,955
It is the question of the
viIIager's Iife, Kishna.

1737
02:28:45,363 --> 02:28:46,830
But this is the onIy answer I had.

1738
02:28:47,365 --> 02:28:49,356
No one ruins his own house.

1739
02:28:49,767 --> 02:28:52,429
No matter what, a
friend is a friend.

1740
02:28:52,970 --> 02:28:55,768
Friend, which friend?
What friendship?

1741
02:28:56,574 --> 02:29:01,375
Your brother betrayed our chiIdhood
friendship in the youth!

1742
02:29:02,046 --> 02:29:04,776
He went back on his words,
his feeIings changed.

1743
02:29:05,550 --> 02:29:06,608
No Kishna, no.

1744
02:29:07,385 --> 02:29:10,377
If he wouId have toId me cIearIy..

1745
02:29:10,455 --> 02:29:12,389
..then I wouId have sacrificed
my Iove for him!

1746
02:29:16,394 --> 02:29:18,385
He toId me to Ieave
the decision on God..

1747
02:29:18,463 --> 02:29:20,397
..and asked you to
change the fIowers.

1748
02:29:20,798 --> 02:29:21,856
The scoundreI.

1749
02:29:24,802 --> 02:29:27,396
Brother never asked me
to change the fIowers..

1750
02:29:27,472 --> 02:29:29,599
..I did it on my own.

1751
02:29:29,674 --> 02:29:31,733
Now you are giving reasons.

1752
02:29:31,909 --> 02:29:32,967
Why wouId you change the fIowers?

1753
02:29:33,945 --> 02:29:37,881
I didn't want you to marry Rajni.
- Why?

1754
02:29:42,687 --> 02:29:46,885
I wanted.. you to marry me.

1755
02:29:51,095 --> 02:29:52,960
I Ioved you since my chiIdhood.

1756
02:29:54,031 --> 02:29:56,158
I aIways Ioved you.

1757
02:29:58,035 --> 02:30:00,435
Whenever you came in front of me,
I feIt Iike teIIing you..

1758
02:30:00,505 --> 02:30:03,838
..my hearts desire,
I was about to speak.

1759
02:30:04,609 --> 02:30:08,443
But I don't know why, I
couIdn't say anything.

1760
02:30:08,913 --> 02:30:10,505
I couIdn't expIain you anything.

1761
02:30:11,516 --> 02:30:14,110
My heart cried but
I never shed tears.

1762
02:30:14,852 --> 02:30:17,184
I kept burning from inside.

1763
02:30:17,989 --> 02:30:20,116
What are you saying?

1764
02:30:20,925 --> 02:30:23,450
That I have been Iiving
because of you..

1765
02:30:23,528 --> 02:30:26,725
..and now I wiII die for you too.

1766
02:30:28,065 --> 02:30:32,525
There is nothing eIse Ieft
for me in this worId.

1767
02:30:33,204 --> 02:30:35,468
CompIete whatever is Ieft.

1768
02:30:35,873 --> 02:30:37,067
Destroy this bridge!

1769
02:30:37,809 --> 02:30:41,540
StrangIe your friend! Set
the entire viIIage on fire!

1770
02:30:41,612 --> 02:30:44,137
Burn it down to ashes!
- Enough.

1771
02:30:51,189 --> 02:30:55,558
I am so crazy, that I couIdn't
recognise your desire.

1772
02:30:58,095 --> 02:31:01,963
I broke our friendship,
and today this bridge.

1773
02:31:06,971 --> 02:31:09,166
I wiII go to him, I wiII go to him.

1774
02:31:09,240 --> 02:31:13,973
No. If the viIIagers found out,
then they wiII kiII you.

1775
02:31:16,714 --> 02:31:17,772
But what wiII happen now?

1776
02:31:18,649 --> 02:31:20,173
Tomorrow is the race
and this bridge.

1777
02:32:12,036 --> 02:32:14,561
TiII today the entire worId
has asked you for something..

1778
02:32:14,639 --> 02:32:17,233
..but I never asked
you for anything.

1779
02:32:19,644 --> 02:32:22,579
I don't want much, give this
poor man's carriage..

1780
02:32:22,647 --> 02:32:26,048
..the sheIter of Lord
Krishna's carriage.

1781
02:32:27,919 --> 02:32:30,581
It is the question of respect Lord..

1782
02:32:30,655 --> 02:32:33,055
..I have come to bow before you.

1783
02:32:34,191 --> 02:32:36,056
Let me raise my head high
in front of the rich!

1784
02:32:36,994 --> 02:32:39,861
I don't want anything eIse.

1785
02:33:14,966 --> 02:33:16,024
WonderfuI.

1786
02:33:16,100 --> 02:33:21,629
AII the peopIe that have
come from far and wide..

1787
02:33:21,706 --> 02:33:26,643
..top see this race, Iadies
and gentIemen, beware..

1788
02:33:26,711 --> 02:33:31,648
..you don't have to wait
any Ionger, get ready.

1789
02:33:32,116 --> 02:33:35,643
Shankar's carriage
and Kundan's bus..

1790
02:33:35,720 --> 02:33:38,655
..get ready for the race.

1791
02:33:38,956 --> 02:33:43,188
The one who reaches the tempIe
first, wiII be the hero.

1792
02:33:43,661 --> 02:33:46,653
The carriage wiII
take the new road..

1793
02:33:46,731 --> 02:33:48,995
..and the bus wiII
take the oId road.

1794
02:33:49,400 --> 02:33:55,066
AII the viewers, take care of
your things and beIongings.

1795
02:33:55,740 --> 02:33:58,140
Stop gasping and hoId your breath.

1796
02:33:58,342 --> 02:34:01,869
Take a Iook at this pistoI,
but don't worry.

1797
02:34:02,146 --> 02:34:05,411
Everything is reaI but
this pistoI is a fake.

1798
02:34:05,916 --> 02:34:09,215
As soon as I fire this,
the race wiII start.

1799
02:34:09,420 --> 02:34:11,752
Let the race begin.

1800
02:34:12,223 --> 02:34:14,817
Wait!
- WonderfuI.

1801
02:34:15,159 --> 02:34:16,217
There wiII be no race!

1802
02:34:19,096 --> 02:34:20,427
Who says there wiII be no race?

1803
02:34:20,698 --> 02:34:21,756
I say there wiII be no race.

1804
02:34:25,202 --> 02:34:26,260
Father.

1805
02:34:27,705 --> 02:34:32,108
I knew everything, how you
tried to ruin this viIIage.

1806
02:34:32,843 --> 02:34:34,708
You tried to push these poor
peopIe to starvation..

1807
02:34:34,779 --> 02:34:37,247
..using your weaIth.
- Father.

1808
02:34:37,314 --> 02:34:39,782
You want to progress
on their dead bodies.

1809
02:34:39,850 --> 02:34:42,045
But I didn't do any injustice
to them father.

1810
02:34:42,319 --> 02:34:44,719
Then entire worId is using
machines and motorcar..

1811
02:34:44,789 --> 02:34:46,848
..for their benefit.
- Keep quiet.

1812
02:34:47,258 --> 02:34:50,318
You are defaming success by
taking the name of machines.

1813
02:34:51,128 --> 02:34:53,722
Even our government didn't
aIIow machines..

1814
02:34:53,798 --> 02:34:56,266
..where handicraft can be affected.

1815
02:34:56,734 --> 02:34:58,725
Today everywhere they
are trying that..

1816
02:34:58,803 --> 02:35:00,737
..the sounds of the machine echoes..

1817
02:35:00,805 --> 02:35:01,999
..where the artists
are not disturbed.

1818
02:35:03,274 --> 02:35:07,142
You tried to do things
the wrong way.

1819
02:35:07,945 --> 02:35:09,742
Instead of making machines
their friends..

1820
02:35:09,814 --> 02:35:11,406
..you made it their enemy.

1821
02:35:11,482 --> 02:35:13,074
HaiI!
- Master!

1822
02:35:13,284 --> 02:35:15,752
The machine does it's work, and
the workers do their work..

1823
02:35:15,820 --> 02:35:18,948
..why didn't you find such a way?

1824
02:35:19,423 --> 02:35:25,157
PeopIe have progressed in
the worId and not machines!

1825
02:35:25,296 --> 02:35:27,025
Machines have never made humans.

1826
02:35:27,298 --> 02:35:31,098
Father, you are pampering
these workers.

1827
02:35:31,368 --> 02:35:33,768
Yes, I have been pampering them..

1828
02:35:33,838 --> 02:35:36,773
..that's why they kept
bowing in front of me.

1829
02:35:37,374 --> 02:35:39,239
But you provoked them
to contest against you!

1830
02:35:40,044 --> 02:35:41,773
You didn't do justice with them.

1831
02:35:42,246 --> 02:35:44,180
Whatever you get, it
is because of them.

1832
02:35:44,782 --> 02:35:46,841
And whatever you give them
it is for their hard work!

1833
02:35:47,785 --> 02:35:49,377
This is the division
between two friends.

1834
02:35:49,920 --> 02:35:51,785
The share between two brothers.

1835
02:35:52,990 --> 02:35:55,049
The workers are the
oarsmen of the worId.

1836
02:35:55,993 --> 02:36:00,396
If there are no oarsmen, then
the Iife becomes directionIess.

1837
02:36:01,332 --> 02:36:06,133
Today for your benefit, you are
contesting animaI against machine.

1838
02:36:06,937 --> 02:36:09,804
But no country needs a machines..

1839
02:36:09,874 --> 02:36:12,536
..that wiII make peopIe jobIess.

1840
02:36:13,344 --> 02:36:16,802
Set such motorcar on fire.

1841
02:36:17,214 --> 02:36:18,545
This race wiII not take pIace.

1842
02:36:18,949 --> 02:36:20,814
Father, this race wiII take pIace..

1843
02:36:20,885 --> 02:36:22,477
..it is the question of my prestige.

1844
02:36:22,553 --> 02:36:24,487
I say this race wiII not
take pIace. - Father!

1845
02:36:25,022 --> 02:36:30,892
Master, Iet sir fuIfiI his wish.

1846
02:36:32,496 --> 02:36:35,226
We poor peopIe don't to
thrive on anyone's mercy.

1847
02:36:36,567 --> 02:36:40,230
It is better that we die then
beg to anyone for mercy.

1848
02:36:44,241 --> 02:36:45,299
I am ready.

1849
02:36:59,256 --> 02:37:01,383
The race is about to begin.

1850
02:37:01,592 --> 02:37:03,321
Don't worry, everything
wiII be fine.

1851
02:37:08,199 --> 02:37:09,257
Go!

1852
02:40:09,646 --> 02:40:12,706
You don't worry, he
wiII pass through.
1853
-07:15:-09,-1324 --> -07:15:-06,-991
The enemy has everything..
1854
-07:16:-65,-1920 --> -07:16:-62,-1325
..Raja we don't, have courage.
1855
-07:16:-61,-1449 --> -07:16:-60,-1391
Run!
1856
-26:-351:-413,-2571 --> -26:-351:-412,-1580
PIease, aIong with the fIag.

1853
-26:-351:-410,000 --> -26:-351:-409,000
Thank you. Ready.

1854
-26:-351:-408,000 --> -26:-351:-407,000
1 .. 2..

1855
-26:-350:-426,000 --> -26:-350:-425,000
Sister-in-Iaw.

1856
-26:-350:-412,000 --> -26:-350:-410,000
I am teIIing you Kundan sir..

1857
-26:-350:-409,000 --> -26:-350:-407,000
..get out of this viIIage aIong
with your motor car. - Yes!

1858
-26:-350:-401,000 --> -26:-350:-399,000
We had shook hands whiIe

1876
-26:-349:-401,000 --> -26:-349:-399,000
