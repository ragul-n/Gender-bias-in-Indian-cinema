00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,375


3
00:01:59,958 --> 00:02:02,083
Brother + hood

4
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,958
- Brotherhood...
- Brotherhood

5
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:13,750
- Sweet is the Tamil language...
- Sweet is the Tamil language...

6
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:16,542
- What is it?
- Banumathi ma'am has asked for Madhan.

7
00:02:16,583 --> 00:02:17,208
Madhan

8
00:02:17,917 --> 00:02:18,917
Go check what it is.

9
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:22,542
- Let's drink water and go.
- Sister, why have I been called?

10
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:24,708
Why? Well, you've been caught red-handed.

11
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,417
- You're about to feel her wrath...
- Sit down.

12
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,708
Come in.

13
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:29,792
Come in kid.

14
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:38,792
You, who is this?

15
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:43,125
Kitty

16
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:46,125
Silence!

17
00:02:48,292 --> 00:02:50,792
- She's my sister.
- And what is this?

18
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:52,625
It's the mark sheet.

19
00:02:52,667 --> 00:02:54,250
I'm aware of that. What is this?

20
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:55,917
This...

21
00:02:56,542 --> 00:02:58,083
It's my signature.

22
00:02:58,167 --> 00:03:00,750
- Our parents...
- I'm aware that they are no more...

23
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:03,708
Aren't you both staying with your Aunt?

24
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:05,125
We used to...

25
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:07,833
My uncle... He's an alcoholic...

26
00:03:08,292 --> 00:03:09,375
He abuses us...

27
00:03:09,667 --> 00:03:12,000
So we shifted back to our house.

28
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:14,458
Listen child...

29
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,000
- In the absence of parents,
a Guardian has to sign... - Teacher!

30
00:03:17,292 --> 00:03:20,000
Kitty is my mother, and I am her father.

31
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,167
I will be signing her
mark sheet henceforth.

32
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:40,458
In this all-encompassing world

33
00:03:40,667 --> 00:03:43,417
Everything seems beautiful

34
00:03:44,167 --> 00:03:47,375
This mortal life

35
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,708
Is a poem in itself

36
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:55,167
Like the nails that outgrow a finger
Hey, brother-in-law!

37
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:58,583
- Come here...
His love overflows

38
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:00,708
Is it a boon?
- Who's a brother-in-law?

39
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:05,708
- The one who will marry Raji...
Or is it burden? It's hard to understand.

40
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:07,917
A brother
- Rajalakshmi!

41
00:04:07,917 --> 00:04:09,750
And a father
- What? - Come here! - Kitty!

42
00:04:09,792 --> 00:04:11,750
He has chosen to be
- Go!

43
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,458
He has chosen to be
I said go!

44
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:20,750
He has crossed the state
of being just a brother

45
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:24,375
In this all-encompassing world

46
00:04:24,417 --> 00:04:27,125
Everything seems beautiful

47
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,875
This mortal life

48
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:34,250
- It looks good! - My brother got it.
Is a poem in itself

49
00:04:34,292 --> 00:04:36,125
- Madhan! Raji!
- Aunty!

50
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:41,667
Mom, look at them!

51
00:04:42,292 --> 00:04:44,375
- Raji, I'm keeping the money here.
- Okay, aunty...

52
00:04:47,667 --> 00:04:50,042
- Don't fret over anything.
- I'll take my leave then.

53
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,458
Listen, child. Come join
the hostel in Salem.

54
00:04:53,542 --> 00:04:55,917
Your brother will stay at
the hostel in Chennai, okay?

55
00:04:57,292 --> 00:05:03,583
Even while asleep, his senses don't fail

56
00:05:04,542 --> 00:05:10,500
Even in a dream, he'll be a guardian

57
00:05:11,792 --> 00:05:15,125
She fills his world
I'll do it.

58
00:05:15,167 --> 00:05:19,250
Look at how beautifully he lives
No, continue your work.

59
00:05:19,292 --> 00:05:22,333
She's like a daughter to him

60
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:26,417
He's a shorter version of a mother

61
00:05:26,417 --> 00:05:30,167
To explain the extent of his love

62
00:05:30,167 --> 00:05:33,292
No language will suffice

63
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,708
A brother

64
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,625
And a father
Madhan!

65
00:05:37,667 --> 00:05:40,833
He has become
- Where's the kitty? - That way!

66
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:48,375
He has crossed the state
of being just a brother

67
00:06:10,917 --> 00:06:13,083
Lady, who rides this bike?

68
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:16,042
- My brother...
- Roads aren't for his speeding! - Loafer!

69
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:18,750
I said he's my brother! Don't
you dare call him that!

70
00:06:18,792 --> 00:06:19,792
He did make a mistake.

71
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:22,708
Here, you can keep this.

72
00:06:24,292 --> 00:06:30,500
Her silence means anger. It knows no words.

73
00:06:31,667 --> 00:06:37,625
Her tears can be painful.
It can be unbearable.

74
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:46,208
His wishes have become
the center of her life

75
00:06:46,292 --> 00:06:53,375
To lose to him means a huge victory to her

76
00:06:53,542 --> 00:07:00,375
In her heart, he remains a child

77
00:07:00,417 --> 00:07:07,750
A mother and a sister, she has chosen to be

78
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:14,167
She forgets that she is indeed his sister
Kitty, I'm sorry.

79
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:15,458
You're my brother!

80
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:19,167
In this all-encompassing world
Please change the channel...

81
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:22,625
Everything seems beautiful
-It's the finals... - Give it to me!

82
00:07:22,667 --> 00:07:25,250
Go away!
This mortal life

83
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,500
Let go, I'll do it...

84
00:07:26,542 --> 00:07:28,750
Is a poem in itself

85
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:36,792
Like the nails that outgrow a
finger, his love overflows

86
00:07:37,292 --> 00:07:41,000
Is it a boon? Or burden?
- Kitty!

87
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:44,167
- Kitty! - Hey! She's your sister!'s
It's hard to understand

88
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:46,542
- Sister! - Let's go...
A brother

89
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:48,375
You didn't buy it?
and a father

90
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:51,708
He has chosen to be!

91
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:59,250
He has crossed the state
of being just a brother

92
00:07:59,292 --> 00:08:03,000
In this all-encompassing world
- Can I see the ruby-stone earrings?

93
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,042
Everything seems beautiful

94
00:08:06,042 --> 00:08:06,625
Step aside...

95
00:08:06,667 --> 00:08:13,000
This mortal life is a poem in itself
Sorry, it was a mistake.

96
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,500
- Jaya?
- Yes...

97
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:31,458
- Hurry up!
- Wake up earlier!

98
00:08:31,542 --> 00:08:33,292
- Hold her, I'm late!
- Hand her over...

99
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:35,542
- Lock the gate.
- I'll do that. You get going.

100
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:40,667
- Bye, baby!
- Say 'bye' to daddy...

101
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:42,208
Say 'bye' to mommy...

102
00:08:42,667 --> 00:08:43,750
Have you tuned the bike?

103
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:44,958
It's only been two days.

104
00:08:45,917 --> 00:08:46,917
Shit, it's aunt!

105
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,792
- Tell me aunty...
- Where are you?

106
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,500
Hold that!

107
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:55,500
- In my neighborhood.
- Are you lying? I heard the revving!

108
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,500
Are you at the mechanic's? Lying to me!

109
00:08:57,792 --> 00:08:58,500
Hit your head!

110
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:02,042
- I did...
- How dare you lie to me?

111
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:07,042
- I'll come there!
- Sure, try me.

112
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:09,042
I really am coming tonight.

113
00:09:09,292 --> 00:09:10,667
I'll see you at the bus stand then.

114
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:13,292
- Start the bike.
- Won't you ask why I'm coming?

115
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:15,875
I'll take my leave, sir.
Inform kitty whatever it is.

116
00:09:16,042 --> 00:09:18,125
- Careful kids! - See you, sir!
- Win it!

117
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,917
I've seen girls fall for
guys, but check this out!

118
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:37,583
Her father must be a pauper!

119
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:41,417
You wouldn't let me take an auto,
at least go faster! I'm embarrased!

120
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,833
Stop nudging! I've made sure you get shade!

121
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,500
What's free babe?

122
00:09:45,667 --> 00:09:48,250
- Which one is free?
- Everyone's overtaking us!

123
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:51,083
- There's space! Go faster!
- Shut up!

124
00:09:51,167 --> 00:09:52,208
I am going fast.

125
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,375
You might as well turn off
the engine at this speed.

126
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,250
- At least someone will tow us back home.
- Turn your engine off!

127
00:09:58,667 --> 00:10:00,042
Shall I tow you back home?

128
00:10:00,167 --> 00:10:00,875
Dingleberry!

129
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:02,333
What? Hey!

130
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:08,958
Dingleberry?

131
00:10:19,167 --> 00:10:19,750
Look at that!

132
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:24,917
- Hey, stop the bike!
- What is it?

133
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:28,875
- It'll take that guy a week. Our friends
are waiting! - She's giving me looks!

134
00:11:13,292 --> 00:11:14,417
Piece of cake!

135
00:11:40,292 --> 00:11:41,583
Awesome, man!

136
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:43,208
That's how you do it!

137
00:11:43,292 --> 00:11:46,917
You think you're big now?
Racing with this piece of crap?

138
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:25,167
It doesn't matter which bike you race with
in traffic. The difference is the rider.

139
00:12:25,417 --> 00:12:28,333
It comes down to who can take
those tiny gaps. Am I right?

140
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:40,417
Greetings!

141
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,250
- Welcome, sir!
- Greetings!

142
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:44,917
- Are you the one who's racing?
- No, it's Karthi.

143
00:12:44,917 --> 00:12:45,417
Yes sir.

144
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:46,583
- The opponent?
- This guy.

145
00:12:47,542 --> 00:12:48,208
Greetings, sir!

146
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:49,792
Madhan with the RX 100.

147
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:51,708
Karthik with the Duke 200.

148
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:57,667
We're racing from Ashok Pillar
to Tirusulam in traffic.

149
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:03,292
The winner gets to do whatever
with the loser's bike.

150
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:07,417
We're bound by this agreement in
Sir Java Thangavel's presence.

151
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:29,542
- They're here! Quick!
- Get him Karthi!

152
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:34,125
Hey! Damn it!

153
00:13:52,792 --> 00:13:53,333
Hey!

154
00:13:56,792 --> 00:14:01,375
- Look, Madhan is here!
- Let's go!

155
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:19,458
Kasi Theatre walkie to Control.

156
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,458
Hello. Hello. Alandur Signal.

157
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,792
Two rash drivers. Black
Yamaha and an orange Duke.

158
00:14:32,792 --> 00:14:33,792
I'll take care.

159
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,958
- What is this? - Manohar!
- Sir?

160
00:14:38,042 --> 00:14:39,083
Two guys are racing...

161
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:41,000
- Stop them.
- Okay, sir.

162
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:41,750
Show that...

163
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:46,208
Hey!

164
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:49,292
Stop! I said stop!

165
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:54,958
- Think you can race? Manohar!
- Move it!

166
00:14:55,917 --> 00:14:58,750
Shankar! Automate the signal
and take him to the hospital!

167
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:35,458
You!

168
00:15:55,667 --> 00:15:57,750
Who is it? Who's there?

169
00:15:58,583 --> 00:15:59,583
Damn you!

170
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:02,333
Stop right there!

171
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:23,333
Stop!

172
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:35,083
I said stop!

173
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:50,958
Saidapet calling Control Room.

174
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:54,417
Send a Patrol vehicle immediately to
3rd Street outside Mount Station.

175
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:00,208
Come out.

176
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:02,250
- Sir...
- Come out I said!

177
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,375
- Come!
- Let me go, sir...

178
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:04,208
Trying to escape?

179
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:07,250
Sir! Let me go, I'll come...

180
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,375
Sir...

181
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:11,083
Let me go, please sir...

182
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:12,167
- Sir...
- Let's go.

183
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:14,125
Sir? How can I come like this?

184
00:17:14,542 --> 00:17:16,583
It'll be embarrassing in the streets.

185
00:17:17,792 --> 00:17:19,583
At least get me that pant, sir.

186
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:21,000
Please, sir...

187
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:40,125
Sir?

188
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:43,042
Sir, please sir, not that...

189
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,000
Don't, sir. Please...

190
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:47,458
Anything except that...

191
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:48,500
Please, sir...

192
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:01,708
Look at that!

193
00:18:02,542 --> 00:18:04,042
He looks good in the
nightie isn't it?

194
00:18:26,042 --> 00:18:27,917
You, whose chain did you snatch?

195
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:29,083
I'm talking to you!

196
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:32,625
Sir, I was just in a bike race.

197
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:35,542
Aren't you racing just to snatch chains?

198
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:38,542
- Welcome, lady cops.
- Greetings, sir.

199
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,208
Stripping them to their
briefs is fine, what's this?

200
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:47,500
- It's Traffic SI Rajasekhar's case.
- How come we never find such nighties?

201
00:18:47,792 --> 00:18:49,750
- What brand is it?
- Why don't you ask him?

202
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:51,583
- Let's go in and discuss.
- Okay, sir.

203
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:52,917
Hey... Madhan!

204
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:54,542
- Madhan!
- Sir, we have 2 grand...

205
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:56,042
Step aside!

206
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,167
He's injured a Traffic constable.

207
00:18:58,167 --> 00:19:00,500
- Sir, did I do that?
- Hey!

208
00:19:01,667 --> 00:19:05,125
Just wait. Our team has
gone to nab your opponent.

209
00:19:05,292 --> 00:19:06,667
Stop with your yapping.

210
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,458
Make sure the Inspector
doesn't file a case.

211
00:19:10,542 --> 00:19:11,542
You, get going.

212
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:12,750
Get us 10 grand.

213
00:19:12,792 --> 00:19:14,625
- Sir, take this...
- Keep it with yourself.

214
00:19:14,792 --> 00:19:15,792
Have you seen your faces?

215
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:17,208
What are you looking at?

216
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:19,333
Sir, I hope you didn't
file a case against them.

217
00:19:19,667 --> 00:19:21,917
We were the winners.
Drop by in the morning.

218
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:23,458
There's 10 grand in this.

219
00:19:26,917 --> 00:19:27,917
Here, eat up.

220
00:19:33,292 --> 00:19:34,292
Racer...

221
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:38,208
It doesn't matter if you're in your
briefs or a nightie. Don't skip food.

222
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:39,833
Eat up!

223
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,792
Greetings, sir!

224
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:50,333
What's the matter?

225
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:53,042
The Crime Sub-Inspector is on leave.
I'm in-charge.

226
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:27,583
What?

227
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:46,375
What are you staring at?

228
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,500
You guys will race

229
00:20:49,167 --> 00:20:51,958
and pay a fine with concession citing
under-age, and we're supposed to do nothing?

230
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:55,042
I've uploaded your procession on YouTube.
Take a look.

231
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:59,167
This is the punishment for
all you illegal racers.

232
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:01,833
It'll remain until you die.

233
00:21:02,667 --> 00:21:04,000
It'll remain even after your death.

234
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:06,500
Are you disrespecting Sir?

235
00:21:06,542 --> 00:21:08,000
How dare you?

236
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,125
You have the guts to disrespect cops?

237
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:15,167
We should thrash you!

238
00:21:15,667 --> 00:21:17,667
You think you're big? I've
been watching you all day!

239
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:20,250
How disrespectful!

240
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:25,125
- Here Madhan, wear the tee.
- It's fine.

241
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,125
Where are you taking the bike?

242
00:21:28,167 --> 00:21:31,125
We won the race. The bike is ours.
Get your hands off.

243
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:33,125
You do remember the bet, don't you?

244
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:37,708
Listen up. All relatives and
the owner of the bike...

245
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:41,250
Whoever loaned the bike,
and tuned the bike...

246
00:21:41,292 --> 00:21:46,125
Take one last look at the bike.
I'm about to burn it.

247
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:48,083
Come here, loser.

248
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:49,917
The honor is yours.

249
00:21:49,917 --> 00:21:52,542
- Shall we burn it?
- Do it!

250
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:53,375
Here...

251
00:22:34,667 --> 00:22:37,167
Get your hands off. I'll
thrash you if you drum on it.

252
00:22:57,583 --> 00:22:58,917
- Tea! - Here...
- Two teas!

253
00:22:59,042 --> 00:22:59,958
Take the tea.

254
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,708
Hey, it's your Aunt.

255
00:23:06,583 --> 00:23:07,250
My aunt?

256
00:23:07,667 --> 00:23:10,417
Since your phone was confiscated
by the cops she's been calling me.

257
00:23:10,458 --> 00:23:12,667
I didn't pick up fearing she'll
find out that you were racing.

258
00:23:13,208 --> 00:23:15,833
Shit, that's right. She told
me she was coming from Hosur.

259
00:23:15,875 --> 00:23:17,500
Ask her what it is. Talk to her.

260
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:18,458
Hello...

261
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,000
- Aunty! I'm here!
- Where were you all night?

262
00:23:26,042 --> 00:23:27,042
Come inside first!

263
00:23:27,042 --> 00:23:29,125
- What's happening? - I'll tell you.
- This is my eldest daughter-in-law.

264
00:23:29,167 --> 00:23:30,500
- Is it so?
- Yes.

265
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:33,417
This is Rajalakshmi's only brother, Madhan.

266
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,667
It's his close friend's
brother's wedding today.

267
00:23:35,792 --> 00:23:38,417
He's been helping them with the wedding.

268
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:41,625
- That's why he's late.
- Is it? - Yes.

269
00:23:41,667 --> 00:23:42,667
Come, sit down.

270
00:23:43,417 --> 00:23:44,417
I'm good.

271
00:23:45,208 --> 00:23:47,000
- Look it's Sebastian sir.
- Greetings, welcome...

272
00:23:47,167 --> 00:23:48,750
Where's Kitty? Tell me!

273
00:23:48,792 --> 00:23:51,167
- Go on. - Where?
- She's over there.

274
00:23:54,958 --> 00:23:55,958
Come here.

275
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,875
That's my younger brother.

276
00:23:59,333 --> 00:23:59,917
Is it?

277
00:24:15,958 --> 00:24:17,208
Raji, I really like you.

278
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:19,417
Tell me if you like me.

279
00:24:22,625 --> 00:24:23,625
Well...

280
00:24:23,625 --> 00:24:25,833
Kitty must not like him!

281
00:24:25,875 --> 00:24:26,875
Uh...

282
00:24:27,125 --> 00:24:28,167
Kitty must not like him!

283
00:24:28,542 --> 00:24:30,042
- Kitty must not like him!
- Tell me if you like me...

284
00:24:31,583 --> 00:24:34,625
I feel a little anxious since he's a cop...

285
00:24:34,792 --> 00:24:37,292
- Kitty must not like him!
- But...

286
00:24:37,333 --> 00:24:40,417
- I don't want to miss him.
- Kitty must not like him!

287
00:24:40,458 --> 00:24:42,375
- Tell him you don't like him!
- Raji?

288
00:24:42,625 --> 00:24:43,583
Tell him you don't like him!

289
00:24:43,792 --> 00:24:44,500
I like you!

290
00:24:54,375 --> 00:24:56,375
Son? Are you guys done yet?

291
00:24:56,750 --> 00:25:01,667
You guys took your time in a restaurant.
Imagine if this was at home!

292
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:03,083
Raji?

293
00:25:03,875 --> 00:25:05,375
If you don't mind, can we take a selfie?

294
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:19,875
Brother...

295
00:25:20,458 --> 00:25:22,042
You like the girl right?

296
00:25:22,625 --> 00:25:24,750
We went because she was
beautiful in the photos.

297
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:26,375
But she looks better in person.

298
00:25:26,708 --> 00:25:28,625
Let's visit their house next Sunday.

299
00:25:29,833 --> 00:25:30,458
But...

300
00:25:30,875 --> 00:25:32,625
The girl's brother...

301
00:25:33,833 --> 00:25:35,958
There's something wrong with him.
Isn't it?

302
00:25:36,458 --> 00:25:38,375
- You're right.
- Am I going to marry him?

303
00:25:38,792 --> 00:25:40,167
What's with the humor?

304
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:42,125
Brothers-in-law are a boon.

305
00:25:42,625 --> 00:25:43,667
Look at my brothers-in-law.

306
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:47,042
- They dance to my tunes.
- Shut up!

307
00:25:48,542 --> 00:25:50,792
But there's something
wrong with that guy.

308
00:25:50,792 --> 00:25:51,542
Raj...

309
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:54,042
You think he would have been
at the marriage hall last night?

310
00:25:57,125 --> 00:25:58,667
- Something fishy...
- Increase the volume.

311
00:25:58,917 --> 00:25:59,917
It's a nice song.

312
00:26:00,333 --> 00:26:00,917
Isn't it?

313
00:26:02,875 --> 00:26:07,333
Madhan will use his brother-in-law's influence
to escape the traffic cops hereafter.

314
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:08,833
That's true.

315
00:26:09,417 --> 00:26:12,000
I feel like they're a really nice family.

316
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:13,708
If this alliance works out

317
00:26:13,792 --> 00:26:15,625
my brother and his wife

318
00:26:15,917 --> 00:26:18,833
- will let out a huge sigh of relief.
- Don't worry.

319
00:26:18,875 --> 00:26:20,125
Everything will fall in place.

320
00:26:20,208 --> 00:26:23,625
Our thoughts aside, I wonder
what those two are thinking.

321
00:26:23,667 --> 00:26:25,333
- They're all smiles.
- Madhan...

322
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:27,000
You like the groom right?

323
00:26:28,292 --> 00:26:30,625
I didn't feel like I was
talking to a new person.

324
00:26:30,625 --> 00:26:33,208
I spoke to him just like I would to you.

325
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:35,333
We have sought many alliances...

326
00:26:36,083 --> 00:26:38,750
But he's the only guy who
didn't ask for my number.

327
00:26:39,042 --> 00:26:40,375
I really like that.

328
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:42,667
He will get it from Aunt.

329
00:26:43,292 --> 00:26:44,125
He will?

330
00:26:44,583 --> 00:26:45,708
Will he, Madhan?

331
00:26:46,083 --> 00:26:46,917
He will.

332
00:26:47,583 --> 00:26:48,583
He will, right?

333
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:14,708
Who are you, oh woman?

334
00:27:15,375 --> 00:27:18,875
You make me ache for you

335
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:24,375
Unfulfilled desires you seem to instigate

336
00:27:26,833 --> 00:27:30,500
Lean on my shoulders

337
00:27:30,792 --> 00:27:34,292
I've fallen for you

338
00:27:34,458 --> 00:27:39,583
You tickle my senses away

339
00:27:42,167 --> 00:27:45,625
Those words that you uttered

340
00:27:45,625 --> 00:27:46,250
I like you.

341
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:50,125
I'm keeping as a heartfelt memory

342
00:27:50,167 --> 00:27:56,875
Those words that you uttered,
have now become by breath.

343
00:27:56,917 --> 00:27:58,875
O' little lovebird

344
00:27:58,875 --> 00:28:00,833
Nest in my heart

345
00:28:00,875 --> 00:28:02,917
What have you done to me?

346
00:28:02,958 --> 00:28:04,875
I'm aching within

347
00:28:04,917 --> 00:28:08,708
I don't need anyone but you by my side

348
00:28:08,708 --> 00:28:13,208
With you resting on my lap,
even death is fearless.

349
00:28:14,292 --> 00:28:16,792
Your sister will understand if
you don't like him. Tell her.

350
00:28:17,042 --> 00:28:18,125
How will he?

351
00:28:18,292 --> 00:28:21,125
You know what will happen if his
sister finds out about the race.

352
00:28:22,042 --> 00:28:23,167
If that happens...

353
00:28:23,625 --> 00:28:24,625
I can never race.

354
00:28:40,458 --> 00:28:42,500
- What does your brother say?
- He's fine with it.

355
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:45,792
- Did he say anything about me?
- Ask him yourself.

356
00:28:45,833 --> 00:28:47,250
- Here...
- No way!

357
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:48,708
- Talk to him.
- You talk to him.

358
00:28:49,708 --> 00:28:52,708
He doesn't have his license
yet, so he's freaking out.

359
00:28:53,333 --> 00:28:55,250
- that's all...
- Did I say that?

360
00:28:55,292 --> 00:28:59,125
To hold your hand in mine

361
00:28:59,125 --> 00:29:02,583
I need you in my life

362
00:29:02,958 --> 00:29:06,750
Every moment that I don't see you

363
00:29:06,792 --> 00:29:10,083
My heart sheds tears of love

364
00:29:10,917 --> 00:29:14,458
I didn't foresee this with you

365
00:29:14,458 --> 00:29:17,958
Let's begin by holding hands

366
00:29:18,292 --> 00:29:22,125
I can feel your pulse in my fingers

367
00:29:22,167 --> 00:29:25,667
I'm not sure if I'm
trembling or if it tickles

368
00:29:25,792 --> 00:29:29,083
I'll sweep you off your feet

369
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:33,458
And keep you close to my heart

370
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:37,375
I'll rest on your comforting shoulders.

371
00:29:37,417 --> 00:29:40,708
You are the source of my life!

372
00:29:40,708 --> 00:29:44,292
O' little lovebird. Nest in my heart.
Madhan! Isn't the baby cute?

373
00:29:44,333 --> 00:29:48,208
What have you done to me?
I'm aching within.

374
00:29:48,208 --> 00:29:52,042
I don't need anyone but you by my side

375
00:29:52,083 --> 00:29:56,542
With you resting on my lap,
even death is fearless.

376
00:30:07,875 --> 00:30:10,625
What sort of a hairstyle is this?
You look like a freak.

377
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:14,458
- Stop it. You're just jealous.
- Guys, hold it! Stop!

378
00:30:14,667 --> 00:30:16,333
- You! Stop!
- Where do you stay?

379
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,083
Listen, we're all drunk right now.

380
00:30:20,125 --> 00:30:21,292
What are you saying?

381
00:30:21,417 --> 00:30:22,625
- We don't understand...
- We're drunk!

382
00:30:22,917 --> 00:30:23,458
Let's go.

383
00:30:23,583 --> 00:30:24,583
- Hey
- Yes?

384
00:30:24,583 --> 00:30:27,708
Look at those drunkards
driving like it's a test.

385
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:30,292
- India's future! Stop them!
- Stop right there!

386
00:30:30,292 --> 00:30:32,042
Pull over.

387
00:30:32,042 --> 00:30:34,917
- Bright future!
- Pull over and get off the bike.

388
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:36,583
Move it. Faster!

389
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:40,250
Huh? Blow into it properly.

390
00:30:41,417 --> 00:30:44,958
- How can the readings be negative?
- The straw is broken.

391
00:30:44,958 --> 00:30:46,000
You, blow at me!

392
00:30:47,542 --> 00:30:52,417
Wine? I used to drink it as a kid, silly.

393
00:30:52,458 --> 00:30:53,625
Step aside.

394
00:30:53,667 --> 00:30:55,667
You don't even know who you're blowing at.

395
00:30:55,667 --> 00:30:56,667
Blow at me.

396
00:30:56,875 --> 00:30:58,250
- What?
- I said blow.

397
00:30:58,917 --> 00:31:01,125
- Don't you have Dengue?
- Dengue?

398
00:31:01,833 --> 00:31:02,833
What are you saying?

399
00:31:02,875 --> 00:31:03,875
Constable...

400
00:31:04,167 --> 00:31:04,917
What's the matter?

401
00:31:04,958 --> 00:31:08,250
They're sloshed, but the
meter readings are negative.

402
00:31:08,292 --> 00:31:10,458
How will it be positive?

403
00:31:10,667 --> 00:31:12,583
- Handle it.
- Okay, sir.

404
00:31:12,583 --> 00:31:15,667
Sir, you need to handle this.

405
00:31:15,667 --> 00:31:18,167
- Where do you think you're going?
- Get your hands off me!

406
00:31:18,292 --> 00:31:20,667
Off you go!
Sir, you need to handle this.

407
00:31:20,833 --> 00:31:22,292
Check if I'm drunk.

408
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,500
Check me...

409
00:31:25,917 --> 00:31:27,083
Check me, sir...

410
00:31:29,333 --> 00:31:30,667
I said check me!

411
00:31:32,208 --> 00:31:33,792
Are you visiting our house tomorrow?

412
00:31:35,167 --> 00:31:36,167
- Shankar...
- Sir?

413
00:31:36,708 --> 00:31:38,042
These guys aren't drunk.

414
00:31:38,625 --> 00:31:39,500
Let them go.

415
00:31:39,542 --> 00:31:40,542
Yay!

416
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:42,583
That's the way to do it!

417
00:31:42,625 --> 00:31:46,250
I told you that pill removes
alcohol traces didn't I?

418
00:31:46,667 --> 00:31:48,333
We'll never get caught!

419
00:31:48,333 --> 00:31:50,083
What can you do?

420
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:52,083
- We've taken the pill!
- Sir?

421
00:31:52,417 --> 00:31:54,625
Are these pills for real?

422
00:31:54,708 --> 00:31:57,167
Get on with your work!

423
00:31:57,458 --> 00:31:59,250
Sorry, sir.

424
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:01,125
What will you do?

425
00:32:01,292 --> 00:32:02,750
We'll never get caught!

426
00:32:02,958 --> 00:32:04,500
What can you do?

427
00:32:04,917 --> 00:32:06,542
We've taken the pill!

428
00:32:07,333 --> 00:32:08,667
Mom, hang up. I'll call back.

429
00:32:08,667 --> 00:32:11,375
We'll never get caught! What can you do?

430
00:32:11,417 --> 00:32:13,208
- Tell me kitty
- The pill...

431
00:32:14,583 --> 00:32:15,042
What?

432
00:32:15,875 --> 00:32:18,042
- Over the phone? How?
- What's he asking?

433
00:32:21,292 --> 00:32:23,125
- You're at home...
- Is he talking to his sister?

434
00:32:23,167 --> 00:32:24,167
How can I?

435
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:27,208
- I'm on duty. - Dude, what is this?
- The noise?

436
00:32:27,583 --> 00:32:30,083
Some loafers are pretending to be drunk.

437
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:31,667
Your brother isn't home?

438
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:33,667
No wonder!

439
00:32:33,917 --> 00:32:35,917
Is that why you're dirty talking?

440
00:32:36,458 --> 00:32:37,667
Like the Hollywood scenes?

441
00:32:39,125 --> 00:32:41,583
Let's save that for after we get married.

442
00:32:41,625 --> 00:32:42,417
Madhan...

443
00:32:42,542 --> 00:32:44,375
I think Kitty has started boozing.

444
00:32:46,792 --> 00:32:49,083
Sorry Madhan...

445
00:33:07,708 --> 00:33:09,500
Madhu, please!

446
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,833
I won't challenge you in business again.

447
00:33:11,875 --> 00:33:13,625
I won't stand in your way.

448
00:33:13,667 --> 00:33:17,708
This will be the last time. I won't
cause any trouble whatsoever.

449
00:33:17,708 --> 00:33:20,792
Let me go Madhu, please!

450
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:24,083
It will never happen again!
Please let me go!

451
00:33:25,208 --> 00:33:27,708
I won't challenge you again.

452
00:33:28,083 --> 00:33:29,083
Please...

453
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:40,542
- Challenge? - No
- You're challenging me?

454
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:47,375
The people who challenge me

455
00:33:47,792 --> 00:33:48,792
have never

456
00:33:49,042 --> 00:33:51,375
lived by their terms

457
00:33:51,875 --> 00:33:54,250
nor have they died by their terms.

458
00:34:03,917 --> 00:34:05,625
Pull over here.

459
00:34:05,667 --> 00:34:08,625
- Welcome, sir. Greetings!
- Welcome, sir.

460
00:34:08,875 --> 00:34:11,750
We're Madhan's childhood friends.

461
00:34:11,792 --> 00:34:14,417
Look at what we've done for you.

462
00:34:17,958 --> 00:34:19,958
We got all these from Facebook.

463
00:34:27,917 --> 00:34:30,042
Do you like the pictures and the captions?

464
00:34:31,083 --> 00:34:32,833
Isn't the poster awesome?

465
00:34:36,125 --> 00:34:37,167
- Shall we go?
- Sure.

466
00:34:37,333 --> 00:34:39,375
This way. Let's take the shortcut.

467
00:34:48,958 --> 00:34:52,542
Don't worry it's just my Grandpa's brief.
Let's take the left.

468
00:34:52,708 --> 00:34:54,667
Sir, this is The Goddess!

469
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:57,125
- Pray to her.
- She's powerful I tell you.

470
00:35:04,333 --> 00:35:05,792
- Mom!
- What is it?

471
00:35:05,958 --> 00:35:07,125
Our footwear is missing.

472
00:35:07,167 --> 00:35:11,292
- Yay!
- Come on kids!

473
00:35:11,292 --> 00:35:15,042
The first job was a hit. The
second job should be shit.

474
00:35:15,083 --> 00:35:16,583
Understood? Go on now.

475
00:35:16,625 --> 00:35:19,583
Careful sir, there's cow
dung along the way.

476
00:35:19,583 --> 00:35:22,750
It's a good sign to lose
your footwear while praying.

477
00:35:23,417 --> 00:35:27,250
They hogged and now they're letting loose.

478
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:28,917
Have a lolipop sister!

479
00:35:31,458 --> 00:35:33,083
Move it Four Eyes!

480
00:35:34,083 --> 00:35:35,833
Who the hell are you in between?

481
00:35:35,875 --> 00:35:37,583
- I'll kill you first!
- Prasad!

482
00:35:37,625 --> 00:35:39,875
Calm down bro, you're out on a week's bail.

483
00:35:39,917 --> 00:35:41,667
Take it easy. What's the rush?

484
00:35:41,708 --> 00:35:43,875
I'm letting him go for your sake!

485
00:35:44,875 --> 00:35:46,208
You! Stop!

486
00:35:46,292 --> 00:35:48,667
- I'll kill you!
- Sir, this is common in this area.

487
00:35:48,708 --> 00:35:49,958
There was a murder this morning.

488
00:35:49,958 --> 00:35:50,958
Come, let's go home.

489
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:52,375
Brother...

490
00:35:52,958 --> 00:35:53,958
Look here.

491
00:35:59,208 --> 00:36:01,292
It's very close by. Why
didn't we come this way?

492
00:36:01,417 --> 00:36:04,250
We could have but I instructed
them to give you a tour.

493
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:05,708
It's not enough if you just
take a look at the house.

494
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:07,833
You need to know the neighborhood.
That's why.

495
00:36:07,958 --> 00:36:09,250
Let's go. Come.

496
00:36:12,083 --> 00:36:14,833
- Greetings! How are you?
- Welcome! Come inside.

497
00:36:30,792 --> 00:36:33,292
- Serve everyone.
- When did you finish college?

498
00:36:34,208 --> 00:36:34,833
Take it.

499
00:36:39,625 --> 00:36:42,167
What the hell? Is this the time for this?

500
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:45,250
- Get out I said!
- It's the Corporation's orders.

501
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:48,458
- Who are you? I said get out!
- Hold on, I'm almost done.

502
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:51,083
- Please sit.
- No one's getting Dengue.

503
00:36:55,375 --> 00:36:57,708
How is it the girl's fault
if the neighborhood is bad?

504
00:36:58,708 --> 00:36:59,708
Mom spoke to me.

505
00:37:00,292 --> 00:37:01,708
Their loo was very clean apparently.

506
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Even Pichu bro said...

507
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,792
We have a maid to do those chores.

508
00:37:04,958 --> 00:37:07,417
Is that a place your kids
need to visit in the future?

509
00:37:10,667 --> 00:37:12,042
So you declined the alliance?

510
00:37:12,125 --> 00:37:13,125
See...

511
00:37:13,542 --> 00:37:15,375
You've always had your way since childhood.

512
00:37:15,792 --> 00:37:17,333
You'd do anything to have your way.

513
00:37:17,542 --> 00:37:18,333
Look...

514
00:37:18,792 --> 00:37:20,833
Look at how many people
we have employed here.

515
00:37:21,292 --> 00:37:24,625
Instead of choosing the Central Vigilance
job in Delhi after your studies

516
00:37:24,792 --> 00:37:26,292
you're out here in the streets.

517
00:37:28,292 --> 00:37:30,667
The heat, the dust and the noise!

518
00:37:30,917 --> 00:37:31,667
Okay...

519
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:34,042
I understand that you like this job.

520
00:37:34,208 --> 00:37:35,625
It only affects you.

521
00:37:35,917 --> 00:37:37,917
But the decision you take in marriage

522
00:37:38,417 --> 00:37:39,917
will even affect our
little Neha at home.

523
00:37:43,333 --> 00:37:44,500
We'll look for someone better.

524
00:37:45,875 --> 00:37:49,417
Come on! You're almost there!

525
00:37:49,417 --> 00:37:52,708
He's lost it!

526
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:56,417
Stop screaming guys. The owner might be
here any minute. I will be in trouble.

527
00:37:56,417 --> 00:37:57,250
Get out!

528
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:00,250
Are you showing off?

529
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:16,708
Look, Madhan, it's your Dingleberry.

530
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:20,000
Hello?

531
00:38:20,417 --> 00:38:22,125
Yes, Geetha, you know what?

532
00:38:22,167 --> 00:38:24,625
That was totally unexpected.
And when I looked so...

533
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,375
What a fall!

534
00:38:37,792 --> 00:38:39,375
Shit! Let's get inside!

535
00:38:40,375 --> 00:38:41,375
Damn it!

536
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,167
Shit!

537
00:38:46,542 --> 00:38:47,542
Hello?

538
00:38:49,083 --> 00:38:50,083
Hello!

539
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,208
Won't you tend to your customer?

540
00:38:52,708 --> 00:38:54,833
What do you want customer?

541
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:56,583
How much does this cost?

542
00:38:57,417 --> 00:38:58,500
How much does this cost?

543
00:38:58,833 --> 00:39:00,083
Are you sure you want that one?

544
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,500
Uh, yes?

545
00:39:02,417 --> 00:39:05,542
I'm sorry, but I saw you falling down.

546
00:39:05,583 --> 00:39:07,458
I can't control my laughter.

547
00:39:08,167 --> 00:39:09,458
Can I laugh just once?

548
00:39:09,458 --> 00:39:10,458
Please?

549
00:39:10,792 --> 00:39:11,792
Please, please?

550
00:39:13,583 --> 00:39:14,583
Fine, laugh!

551
00:39:21,708 --> 00:39:23,500
Hey, I'm sorry...Wait up!

552
00:39:23,625 --> 00:39:26,125
You enquired about the price
but you aren't buying?

553
00:39:26,375 --> 00:39:29,042
Shall I convince the owner
to offer you a 1+1?

554
00:39:29,625 --> 00:39:30,625
What?

555
00:39:31,625 --> 00:39:34,750
You can take it like the
chairs you had the other day.

556
00:39:35,917 --> 00:39:36,542
Hey...

557
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:38,625
It's me, Dingleberry.

558
00:39:38,625 --> 00:39:39,583
Dingleberry!

559
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:40,750
Dingleberry?

560
00:39:42,583 --> 00:39:43,583
Oh! Yes!

561
00:39:43,583 --> 00:39:45,750
- Yes, that's me.
- What's Dingleberry?

562
00:39:45,833 --> 00:39:46,833
Come on, I'll tell you.

563
00:40:01,708 --> 00:40:02,292
Bye.

564
00:40:05,625 --> 00:40:07,667
You, can't you pick up my calls?

565
00:40:07,708 --> 00:40:09,000
Scared to race?

566
00:40:09,417 --> 00:40:12,208
We won the race. You don't
get to call the shots.

567
00:40:12,208 --> 00:40:14,125
If you're fearless, you'd come any moment.

568
00:40:14,125 --> 00:40:15,958
Look at the loser being righteous.

569
00:40:16,125 --> 00:40:17,500
Who lost?

570
00:40:17,625 --> 00:40:18,625
If it wasn't for that...

571
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,667
The cop showed up.

572
00:40:20,708 --> 00:40:23,792
Keep your excuses to yourself.

573
00:40:23,833 --> 00:40:26,750
We don't race with guys who wear nighties.

574
00:40:26,833 --> 00:40:28,708
Everyone has an eye on your fashion.

575
00:40:28,792 --> 00:40:30,542
- Even I was turned on bro.
- Take a look.

576
00:40:30,875 --> 00:40:32,625
Don't you look gorgeous in the nightie?

577
00:40:33,417 --> 00:40:34,333
Start the vehicle.

578
00:40:34,708 --> 00:40:35,958
Bloody loser!

579
00:40:48,542 --> 00:40:50,792
I didn't expect that it would
turn out this beautiful.

580
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:52,250
You like it, right?

581
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,208
- Yes, I do.
- Then I'm happy.

582
00:40:55,083 --> 00:40:56,625
The first gift is always special.

583
00:40:57,042 --> 00:40:57,750
Yes.

584
00:40:58,542 --> 00:40:59,833
Hey, Madhan.

585
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:09,292
- Alright, I'll take my leave.
- Okay.

586
00:41:11,333 --> 00:41:13,000
You could have said something...

587
00:41:21,375 --> 00:41:22,375
What happened?

588
00:41:27,208 --> 00:41:28,208
What's the problem?

589
00:41:29,375 --> 00:41:30,375
I don't like him.

590
00:41:33,417 --> 00:41:35,833
- You're telling me now?
- I've told you now!

591
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,750
I hate him!

592
00:41:49,792 --> 00:41:50,917
Why are you crying?

593
00:41:51,333 --> 00:41:52,333
Tell me Kitty.

594
00:41:54,375 --> 00:41:55,792
Kitty, why are you crying?

595
00:42:15,792 --> 00:42:17,542
Why is everyone crying?

596
00:42:18,375 --> 00:42:19,875
Aunty, why are you crying?

597
00:42:19,917 --> 00:42:21,583
Why do you think people cry?

598
00:42:22,208 --> 00:42:25,958
I'm crying with the thought of the
pain she'll undergo every month.

599
00:42:26,375 --> 00:42:28,208
You're a boy. You'll remain in this house.

600
00:42:28,208 --> 00:42:30,625
But she'll leave this house soon.

601
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:31,833
I'm crying because of that.

602
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,417
Why must Kitty leave this house?

603
00:42:34,667 --> 00:42:36,792
Aren't we supposed to get her married?

604
00:42:37,167 --> 00:42:39,958
The guy who'll marry
her, your brother-in-law

605
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,083
must be a good man. The
thought of that brings tears.

606
00:42:47,708 --> 00:42:49,000
Why should you cry over him?

607
00:42:49,292 --> 00:42:52,625
It's not in our hands whether
a person will be good or not.

608
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:54,750
It's not like a jackfruit
whose quality you can check.

609
00:42:55,042 --> 00:42:56,667
It has to happen.

610
00:42:58,625 --> 00:43:01,125
- Look at the way he talks.
- Stop fretting over it.

611
00:43:01,333 --> 00:43:04,417
This Lion will find a fine
match for his sister.

612
00:43:04,708 --> 00:43:07,083
Won't you find you brother-in-law?

613
00:43:07,208 --> 00:43:10,250
I'm sure you'll find her a King.

614
00:43:16,917 --> 00:43:20,292
- Madhan is there. Call him.
- We need to play well.

615
00:43:20,917 --> 00:43:21,917
Hey, brother-in-law!

616
00:43:23,875 --> 00:43:24,958
Keep the Wides at bay.

617
00:43:25,292 --> 00:43:26,292
What did you say?

618
00:43:26,375 --> 00:43:27,875
I said don't bowl Wides.

619
00:43:28,583 --> 00:43:29,583
Before that part.

620
00:43:29,792 --> 00:43:30,792
I didn't say anything.

621
00:43:33,792 --> 00:43:34,958
Alright let's field.

622
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:35,917
Hey, brother-in-law!

623
00:43:37,125 --> 00:43:38,667
Madhan, don't!

624
00:43:40,375 --> 00:43:41,708
Madhan, don't do it!

625
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:42,750
Stop!

626
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,708
Madhan, don't!

627
00:43:45,708 --> 00:43:47,333
Madhan, stop, don't do it !

628
00:43:56,542 --> 00:43:57,333
Let me go!

629
00:43:58,250 --> 00:43:59,250
Let go of me!

630
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:00,750
I said let go!

631
00:44:04,375 --> 00:44:05,583
Brother, please stop!

632
00:44:06,167 --> 00:44:08,042
Please stop, it hurts!

633
00:44:08,542 --> 00:44:10,417
Please let me go!

634
00:44:14,917 --> 00:44:16,208
Please stop!

635
00:44:23,042 --> 00:44:24,042
Damn it!

636
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:33,042
Kitty!

637
00:44:35,375 --> 00:44:36,708
Kitty!

638
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:48,750
Madhan!

639
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:50,500
Madhan!

640
00:44:52,333 --> 00:44:54,500
So what if he calls you brother-in-law?

641
00:44:54,917 --> 00:44:56,417
I'm not gonna marry him!

642
00:44:56,750 --> 00:44:57,750
Even the other day!

643
00:44:58,167 --> 00:45:00,458
You asked Vidya if her
brother would marry me.

644
00:45:01,333 --> 00:45:02,667
Why are you like this?

645
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:10,875
Who else will seek an alliance for you?

646
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:13,042
What did Aunt say the other day?

647
00:45:14,125 --> 00:45:17,625
She was crying hoping you should
get a good person as your groom.

648
00:45:18,542 --> 00:45:20,667
I'm supposed to look for that good person.

649
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:23,292
Madhan...

650
00:45:23,792 --> 00:45:25,125
I need to study first.

651
00:45:25,250 --> 00:45:27,083
I need to work and...

652
00:45:27,583 --> 00:45:28,583
Just like aunt...

653
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,417
I won't marry an alcoholic.

654
00:45:32,083 --> 00:45:34,542
- I'll marry only if I like...
- You don't know anything!

655
00:45:35,625 --> 00:45:36,958
I'll look for the groom.

656
00:45:37,667 --> 00:45:38,667
I need to like him too.

657
00:45:42,833 --> 00:45:43,667
Okay.

658
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:44,792
Look...

659
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:47,958
If I like someone

660
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:49,833
you need to like him too.

661
00:45:50,208 --> 00:45:51,208
Only then I'll marry him.

662
00:45:51,708 --> 00:45:52,417
Okay?

663
00:45:54,167 --> 00:45:55,167
Promise?

664
00:45:56,125 --> 00:45:57,125
Promise!

665
00:46:17,208 --> 00:46:18,792
What actually happened was...

666
00:46:18,958 --> 00:46:20,417
I was speeding the other day...

667
00:46:23,375 --> 00:46:24,375
You don't like him, right?

668
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:27,583
Here. Go return it.

669
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:28,583
Hold it.

670
00:46:29,542 --> 00:46:30,542
Return it.

671
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:33,875
If you don't want him, neither do I.

672
00:46:34,542 --> 00:46:36,042
Go return it. Here.

673
00:46:38,292 --> 00:46:40,125
I'll delete his number right now. Alright?

674
00:46:54,750 --> 00:46:56,333
Hey! Are you nuts?

675
00:46:56,875 --> 00:46:57,875
Is this how you drive?

676
00:47:03,917 --> 00:47:04,917
Pull over.

677
00:47:06,167 --> 00:47:07,875
Stop talking and pay the fine.

678
00:47:08,625 --> 00:47:09,833
Don't you know the traffic rules?

679
00:47:10,292 --> 00:47:12,125
You crossed the stop-line
after the red signal.

680
00:47:12,375 --> 00:47:13,375
You're a cop right?

681
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,125
Don't you know the rules?

682
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:16,625
You just came to visit our house.

683
00:47:16,833 --> 00:47:17,833
The alliance isn't agreed.

684
00:47:18,167 --> 00:47:19,167
Nothing is fixed.

685
00:47:19,625 --> 00:47:21,667
- And you're showing up with gifts?
- Hey!

686
00:47:21,875 --> 00:47:23,667
- Who do you think you're talking to?
- Shankar...

687
00:47:24,167 --> 00:47:25,167
This is a personal issue.

688
00:47:25,375 --> 00:47:26,542
There's nothing personal.

689
00:47:26,667 --> 00:47:28,292
What's personal between us?

690
00:47:28,833 --> 00:47:29,458
Huh?

691
00:47:30,833 --> 00:47:32,042
Let your sister say that.

692
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:37,542
Here, talk to him.

693
00:47:37,625 --> 00:47:38,625
Talk to her.

694
00:47:40,958 --> 00:47:41,542
Raji?

695
00:47:44,167 --> 00:47:45,292
- Sorry...
- Why?

696
00:47:45,792 --> 00:47:48,208
I didn't know that my
brother didn't like this.

697
00:47:52,833 --> 00:47:53,875
This won't work out.

698
00:47:55,583 --> 00:47:57,500
- Forgive me.
- Raji, listen to me.

699
00:47:57,542 --> 00:47:58,542
Hey, give me that!

700
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:02,125
You were just an insect stuck on food.

701
00:48:02,792 --> 00:48:03,833
My sister got rid of you.

702
00:48:03,875 --> 00:48:08,208
If you come by the house,
or make phone calls and send gifts again

703
00:48:08,583 --> 00:48:09,625
you'll be in trouble.

704
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,333
Dude, get me that crap.

705
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:35,333
Hey, brother-in-law!

706
00:48:38,625 --> 00:48:40,875
Bro, don't do it! Wait! Don't go!

707
00:48:40,917 --> 00:48:43,042
- Let go of me!
- Listen to me bro!

708
00:48:43,083 --> 00:48:45,625
Don't go Madhan!

709
00:48:45,667 --> 00:48:47,000
Don't go Madhan!

710
00:48:53,917 --> 00:48:55,333
Sir, let us handle this guy.

711
00:48:55,708 --> 00:48:56,708
Carry on with your duty.

712
00:48:57,375 --> 00:48:59,083
- He's my brother-in-law.
- Nonsense!

713
00:48:59,375 --> 00:49:00,375
Who is your brother-in-law?

714
00:49:00,833 --> 00:49:03,333
I'll decide whose brother-in-law I'll be.

715
00:49:03,625 --> 00:49:04,625
Listen carefully.

716
00:49:05,083 --> 00:49:07,375
This very moment, I've decided.

717
00:49:07,958 --> 00:49:09,250
You are my brother-in-law.

718
00:49:10,167 --> 00:49:11,167
Dear brother-in-law!

719
00:49:11,833 --> 00:49:13,333
Inform your sister about this.

720
00:49:19,292 --> 00:49:20,417
What has gotten into you?

721
00:49:20,667 --> 00:49:22,417
Weren't you both romancing on the phone?

722
00:49:22,583 --> 00:49:23,958
Tell her it's because he's a cop.

723
00:49:24,125 --> 00:49:25,583
No, he's a cop...

724
00:49:25,625 --> 00:49:27,417
- so I feel scared.
- Scared of what?

725
00:49:27,667 --> 00:49:28,833
He's not selling weed.

726
00:49:29,208 --> 00:49:30,875
- Weed?
- Weren't you both singing on the phone?

727
00:49:31,083 --> 00:49:32,500
Tell her he's collecting bribes.

728
00:49:33,167 --> 00:49:34,250
- Tell her.
- Shut up!

729
00:49:34,417 --> 00:49:36,833
I mean, he might be called
for duty at any moment.

730
00:49:37,125 --> 00:49:38,667
You can't tell when he'll be home.

731
00:49:38,708 --> 00:49:41,583
Didn't you already know that?
Someone has changed your mind.

732
00:49:41,583 --> 00:49:42,542
Where's that sly fellow?

733
00:49:42,958 --> 00:49:45,167
- Tell her I'm not here.
- Talk to her.

734
00:49:45,208 --> 00:49:46,208
Talk to her!

735
00:49:46,542 --> 00:49:47,875
You heard Kitty.

736
00:49:47,917 --> 00:49:49,375
- We'll look for another alliance.
- What?

737
00:49:49,583 --> 00:49:50,792
Another alliance?

738
00:49:50,875 --> 00:49:51,875
Let me talk to her.

739
00:49:52,667 --> 00:49:54,458
Hi aunty, it's me Nosy.

740
00:49:54,875 --> 00:49:57,333
- Tell me.
- Yesterday the traffic cop stopped me.

741
00:49:57,542 --> 00:49:59,167
- So?
- I bribed him just 10 bucks.

742
00:49:59,583 --> 00:50:01,083
I don't think that family will suit us.

743
00:50:01,125 --> 00:50:02,792
And you think you know about families?

744
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:06,083
Your father took money from both
political parties to cast a vote.

745
00:50:06,083 --> 00:50:09,417
- How did she find out?
- And don't even get me started with your mom.

746
00:50:09,417 --> 00:50:12,042
- Don't you utter a word about their family.
- I'm out of this!

747
00:50:12,083 --> 00:50:13,292
Madhan!

748
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:14,958
Do you both think this is a joke?

749
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,667
I've promised to get back
to them with good news.

750
00:50:17,667 --> 00:50:19,667
Whatever it is, let me come there first.

751
00:50:21,583 --> 00:50:22,500
What does that mean?

752
00:50:23,625 --> 00:50:25,750
There's only 13 days left
before Aunt gets back.

753
00:50:25,917 --> 00:50:28,333
We have to find a good
alliance before that.

754
00:50:28,375 --> 00:50:29,375
Is that possible?

755
00:50:30,083 --> 00:50:31,083
Why not?

756
00:50:31,583 --> 00:50:33,833
There's heavy traffic between
Sivaji Junction and Senmozhi Park.

757
00:50:33,833 --> 00:50:35,167
We finished our race in 3.5 minutes.

758
00:50:35,208 --> 00:50:37,250
Finding a groom in 13 days
shouldn't be an issue.

759
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:40,042
We'll find him and we'll
get your sister married.

760
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:46,417
One moment please.

761
00:50:46,958 --> 00:50:48,167
Who's available in customer support?

762
00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:01,292
3 months package.
O wily one!

763
00:51:01,333 --> 00:51:02,458
3 months?
O wily one!

764
00:51:02,458 --> 00:51:03,958
Yes, the Classic Package...
O crafty one!

765
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,250
- We have to find a nice groom.
- In 13 days.

766
00:51:06,250 --> 00:51:07,625
She's going through them woes!

767
00:51:08,083 --> 00:51:10,958
No way! He looks better.
O rosy one!

768
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,250
Made of gold!

769
00:51:12,292 --> 00:51:16,292
Nah!
She snapped, like the kite's thread!

770
00:51:16,333 --> 00:51:20,292
With a lion's roar, he challenged!

771
00:51:20,292 --> 00:51:23,292
He's causing her them woes!

772
00:51:24,667 --> 00:51:28,750
A witty, naive man

773
00:51:28,792 --> 00:51:32,250
He wants to find for a groom!

774
00:51:32,875 --> 00:51:37,000
With no mercy, he troubles her!

775
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,917
Despite all the options

776
00:51:38,917 --> 00:51:41,250
he won't budge!

777
00:51:41,292 --> 00:51:43,208
This guy will be fine, right?
A glorius combo he asks

778
00:51:43,250 --> 00:51:45,125
He's alright.
Of Ranbir and Ranvir!

779
00:51:45,167 --> 00:51:49,500
Is his sister Deepika Padukone?

780
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:01,375
He's very strict. He works as a
Physical Trainer at a school.

781
00:52:03,375 --> 00:52:04,000
Too short?

782
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:06,125
Look straight.

783
00:52:09,125 --> 00:52:10,125
Step on it.

784
00:52:11,292 --> 00:52:12,292
Seems a little overweight.

785
00:52:13,542 --> 00:52:14,542
Open your mouth.

786
00:52:15,333 --> 00:52:17,125
What are you looking at? Get out!

787
00:52:17,167 --> 00:52:17,917
She's not a cow!

788
00:52:17,958 --> 00:52:22,083
If the guy's slick, he thinks it's ego!

789
00:52:22,333 --> 00:52:25,792
What can I say, O Lord!

790
00:52:25,917 --> 00:52:30,625
If the guy's shy, he says he's naive!

791
00:52:30,625 --> 00:52:32,583
Thanks!
I can't stand this!

792
00:52:32,625 --> 00:52:34,667
There's only 6 days left. Will we find him?

793
00:52:34,708 --> 00:52:36,583
O his mischief!

794
00:52:36,583 --> 00:52:38,667
You keep finding faults with everyone!
She's losing it!

795
00:52:38,708 --> 00:52:40,833
It's not like your sister is perfect.
Someone show up

796
00:52:40,833 --> 00:52:43,417
What's wrong with my sister?
and cure his madness!

797
00:52:43,458 --> 00:52:46,167
Even if there's something wrong,
the groom needs to be flawless.

798
00:52:46,167 --> 00:52:49,208
His sister's love is her curse!
He's pushed her to the edge!

799
00:52:49,208 --> 00:52:51,708
In that case, let me go.
No words can explain!

800
00:52:54,625 --> 00:52:55,625
Get lost!

801
00:53:07,417 --> 00:53:09,417
O wily one!

802
00:53:09,458 --> 00:53:11,583
Sorry.
O crafty one!

803
00:53:11,583 --> 00:53:15,667
She's going through them woes!
- Are you a kid? - He's still a kid.

804
00:53:15,667 --> 00:53:18,500
How is this girl?
O rosy one!

805
00:53:18,542 --> 00:53:20,208
We'll talk to their parents?
Made of gold!

806
00:53:20,250 --> 00:53:24,208
Someone is speaking in English.
She snapped like the kite's thread!

807
00:53:24,375 --> 00:53:25,792
- Can you speak to them?
- I'll talk to them.

808
00:53:25,917 --> 00:53:26,667
Hi, Raji!

809
00:53:26,792 --> 00:53:30,583
Why are you calling our neighbors?
Are you a cop or a criminal?

810
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:31,958
That's how I'll behave.

811
00:53:31,958 --> 00:53:33,333
Oh, really? Okay.

812
00:53:35,208 --> 00:53:36,833
Hello, sir. Sit down.

813
00:53:36,833 --> 00:53:39,208
- My name's Rajasekar. I watch
all your shows. - Please.

814
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:40,917
If you don't mind,
can I take a selfie?

815
00:53:46,625 --> 00:53:47,750
Happy married life!

816
00:53:56,417 --> 00:53:58,917
- Sir, please...
- I'm not your guy!

817
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:04,500
No matter what he does

818
00:54:04,667 --> 00:54:08,417
You cannot hate him!

819
00:54:08,542 --> 00:54:12,917
Even with his twisted questions

820
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,625
He makes her insides go crazy!

821
00:54:16,625 --> 00:54:21,083
Something clueless binds them together!

822
00:54:21,083 --> 00:54:25,667
Their naive hearts can't stop fighting it!

823
00:54:25,750 --> 00:54:27,792
To win his heart!

824
00:54:27,792 --> 00:54:29,833
The witty one has fallen!

825
00:54:29,833 --> 00:54:32,000
It's like the cat and mouse!

826
00:54:32,042 --> 00:54:33,625
This game of hearts!

827
00:54:33,667 --> 00:54:38,000
O wily one! O crafty one!

828
00:54:38,042 --> 00:54:42,000
She's going through them woes!

829
00:54:42,208 --> 00:54:46,208
O rosy one! Made of gold!

830
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:50,333
She comes out twisted and turned!

831
00:54:50,375 --> 00:54:54,458
She's got him with her wits and
he's got her with chivalry.

832
00:54:54,458 --> 00:54:57,458
It's all-night WhatsApp trouble!

833
00:54:58,250 --> 00:55:01,083
She blazes silently

834
00:55:01,125 --> 00:55:02,917
He got caught in the fire!

835
00:55:02,958 --> 00:55:06,167
It's on all day, endlessly!

836
00:55:06,792 --> 00:55:09,000
He's the crazy one!

837
00:55:09,042 --> 00:55:10,958
He never gives up!
- Do you like him? - Yeah.

838
00:55:10,958 --> 00:55:15,292
He's got the variety to win her heart!
- Okay! - They're about to leave. - Shankar!

839
00:55:15,292 --> 00:55:17,167
He's the smart one!

840
00:55:17,208 --> 00:55:19,542
He's filled her heart!
Stop the Black Dio. Go.

841
00:55:19,583 --> 00:55:23,917
He searched for a 'he' but found a 'she'.

842
00:55:26,083 --> 00:55:27,083
Where do you work?

843
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:32,375
Brother...

844
00:55:33,792 --> 00:55:35,417
My friend is really scared.

845
00:55:35,583 --> 00:55:36,917
You beat him in the race.

846
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,542
He wants to know if we can change the bet.

847
00:55:39,042 --> 00:55:40,083
I'll give you cash brother.

848
00:55:40,417 --> 00:55:41,625
We have five thousand bucks.

849
00:55:45,125 --> 00:55:47,042
- Come here, sit down!
- Please let me go!

850
00:55:50,792 --> 00:55:51,792
What was the bet?

851
00:55:51,792 --> 00:55:54,292
- I should kiss the silencer if I lose.
- So kiss it!

852
00:56:01,042 --> 00:56:02,958
How dare you show
up in our streets?

853
00:56:08,708 --> 00:56:11,792
- What do you guys want?
- Why are you showing off to these kids?

854
00:56:11,917 --> 00:56:13,250
I've been asking to race for a while now.

855
00:56:13,583 --> 00:56:16,500
- I can't race you.
- It's fine if you don't have the guts.

856
00:56:16,708 --> 00:56:17,917
What about all of you?

857
00:56:18,417 --> 00:56:20,125
How about a written
agreement conceding loss?

858
00:56:20,167 --> 00:56:21,458
- Hey!
- Hold it!

859
00:56:21,875 --> 00:56:24,750
Fine, I'll race you. But in a one-way road.
Are you up for it?

860
00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:26,875
Why one-way? Let's go no-brake.

861
00:56:27,292 --> 00:56:29,125
- When?
- Anytime!

862
00:56:29,125 --> 00:56:30,875
- How about now?
- Get the bike!

863
00:56:30,917 --> 00:56:33,000
- Stop it Madhan! - Why?
- Hold it right there!

864
00:56:33,250 --> 00:56:34,833
- Come here... - Why?
- Just come.

865
00:56:34,833 --> 00:56:36,250
- Let me go!
- Are you insane?

866
00:56:36,292 --> 00:56:37,875
We've just fixed an
alliance for your sister.

867
00:56:37,958 --> 00:56:40,417
Let her get married first.
We can race them later.

868
00:56:40,458 --> 00:56:41,542
How are they related?

869
00:56:41,542 --> 00:56:43,542
Listen, we lost the previous race.

870
00:56:43,833 --> 00:56:45,250
We will challenge you anytime!

871
00:56:45,375 --> 00:56:47,792
This time we'll decide
when the race will happen.

872
00:56:48,250 --> 00:56:49,250
Let's go.

873
00:56:49,833 --> 00:56:52,333
- Sit.
- Look at the losers running away.

874
00:56:56,833 --> 00:56:58,042
What are these two covers?

875
00:56:58,083 --> 00:56:59,083
This is ours.

876
00:56:59,333 --> 00:57:00,333
That's yours.

877
00:57:01,042 --> 00:57:02,917
I informed Ravi sir that
we've fixed your alliance.

878
00:57:03,167 --> 00:57:04,417
And guess what?

879
00:57:04,458 --> 00:57:07,125
He sent us a sample invite
and has asked you to choose.

880
00:57:07,625 --> 00:57:09,292
Kitty, check them out.

881
00:57:15,625 --> 00:57:16,625
Madhan!

882
00:57:17,667 --> 00:57:18,708
- What happened?
- Madhan!

883
00:57:18,917 --> 00:57:19,917
Madhan!

884
00:57:20,042 --> 00:57:21,042
Hey!

885
00:57:22,208 --> 00:57:24,833
Run Kitty Run!

886
00:57:32,250 --> 00:57:34,542
- Hello?
- Sister, are you free now?

887
00:57:34,583 --> 00:57:35,167
Why?

888
00:57:40,417 --> 00:57:41,417
Hi, sister!

889
00:57:43,708 --> 00:57:45,250
- Sit down.
- Why are we here?

890
00:57:45,375 --> 00:57:46,708
You could have just come home.

891
00:57:47,292 --> 00:57:48,375
I wanted to talk to you alone.

892
00:57:48,708 --> 00:57:52,458
I would have shown your
brother about 1101 profiles.

893
00:57:57,208 --> 00:57:58,875
Yesterday when you said
you liked that guy

894
00:57:58,875 --> 00:58:00,125
- Okay?
- Okay.

895
00:58:00,167 --> 00:58:02,417
I didn't feel like you meant it.

896
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:06,417
It's my job to understand your expectation.

897
00:58:07,458 --> 00:58:08,458
Why are we discussing this?

898
00:58:08,458 --> 00:58:11,292
We still have time. Let's
look for another guy.

899
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:13,333
Why choose someone you don't like?

900
00:58:13,333 --> 00:58:15,250
There's still 3 days for
your Aunt to return.

901
00:58:16,667 --> 00:58:20,042
Were you okay with any other alliance?

902
00:58:22,625 --> 00:58:23,625
No...

903
00:58:24,792 --> 00:58:26,250
I've left that in the past.

904
00:58:26,292 --> 00:58:28,083
Forget the guy.

905
00:58:28,083 --> 00:58:29,875
Just tell me why you liked him.

906
00:58:30,333 --> 00:58:31,083
Rajasekar

907
00:58:33,042 --> 00:58:33,625
Hello!

908
00:58:35,208 --> 00:58:36,250
Can I ask you something?

909
00:58:36,792 --> 00:58:38,375
Why are you getting married?

910
00:58:39,917 --> 00:58:41,292
Umm...

911
00:58:41,458 --> 00:58:44,167
We can't live alone forever, right?

912
00:58:44,333 --> 00:58:45,500
That's why.

913
00:58:46,667 --> 00:58:47,667
What about you?

914
00:58:48,333 --> 00:58:49,333
I have two reasons.

915
00:58:50,125 --> 00:58:51,125
One...

916
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:52,958
Every body has needs.

917
00:58:57,292 --> 00:58:58,083
Hello?

918
00:58:59,167 --> 00:59:00,833
Won't you ask me what
the second reason is?

919
00:59:01,875 --> 00:59:02,875
Tell me...

920
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,167
As a cop...

921
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:08,083
I'm forced to interact with
criminals and their crimes.

922
00:59:09,125 --> 00:59:10,833
Within the department and otherwise.

923
00:59:11,333 --> 00:59:12,917
I'm not able to be honest with anyone.

924
00:59:14,083 --> 00:59:16,792
I can't confess at a temple of
God, because I'm not a believer.

925
00:59:19,333 --> 00:59:20,333
So...

926
00:59:21,250 --> 00:59:22,833
With at least one person in the world

927
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:26,125
I'd like be to utterly honest.

928
00:59:29,792 --> 00:59:30,792
That's why I'm getting married.

929
00:59:31,875 --> 00:59:33,375
Wow, that's amazing.

930
00:59:33,625 --> 00:59:35,292
Why did you let go of him then?

931
00:59:35,375 --> 00:59:36,375
That...

932
00:59:36,625 --> 00:59:38,333
My family must like him, right?

933
00:59:38,375 --> 00:59:42,458
Yeah, right. As if you have a huge family.

934
00:59:44,292 --> 00:59:47,417
Even now you won't accept that
your brother doesn't like him.

935
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,875
But what you did was stupid.

936
00:59:51,083 --> 00:59:52,208
Nonsense!

937
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:55,125
Sorry, sister. I'm sorry.

938
00:59:58,083 --> 00:59:59,083
Can I say something?

939
01:00:01,042 --> 01:00:02,542
Your brother loves me a lot!

940
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:06,708
I like him too.

941
01:00:08,333 --> 01:00:09,875
He never told me!

942
01:00:09,958 --> 01:00:12,333
We still haven't told each other.
Forget that.

943
01:00:12,833 --> 01:00:14,583
Try telling him that you don't like me.

944
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Will he let go of me?

945
01:00:16,583 --> 01:00:17,792
Do you think he will?

946
01:00:19,125 --> 01:00:19,792
Sister...

947
01:00:20,250 --> 01:00:23,917
When he's older and he realizes his mistake

948
01:00:24,958 --> 01:00:27,833
all he can say is 'Sorry'.

949
01:00:28,667 --> 01:00:29,667
But what you lose

950
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,000
is your life.

951
01:00:33,042 --> 01:00:35,042
Just because someone guides us

952
01:00:35,042 --> 01:00:38,583
it doesn't mean they can
decide where we go.

953
01:00:43,667 --> 01:00:44,917
Last morning

954
01:00:45,125 --> 01:00:47,042
I met Traffic Sergeant Rajasekar.

955
01:00:48,458 --> 01:00:50,250
He told me about his love.

956
01:00:51,667 --> 01:00:53,083
He also told me about your love.

957
01:00:54,208 --> 01:00:55,208
One week...

958
01:00:55,750 --> 01:00:57,125
You guys lived together
over the phone, right?

959
01:01:00,708 --> 01:01:01,417
Sister...

960
01:01:01,708 --> 01:01:04,250
Try talking to him just once more, please!

961
01:01:04,833 --> 01:01:05,833
No...

962
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,000
I...

963
01:01:07,333 --> 01:01:08,875
I don't have anything else to tell him.

964
01:01:09,042 --> 01:01:11,000
You can decide after you talk to him. Sir?

965
01:01:17,833 --> 01:01:20,583
Don't worry, I'll convince Madhan.

966
01:01:21,042 --> 01:01:23,500
Okay? All the best. Bye.

967
01:01:27,333 --> 01:01:29,000
Why is your phone turned off?

968
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:31,958
You? How are you here?

969
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,875
I called your office and
they told me you were here.

970
01:01:33,875 --> 01:01:35,458
- Anyway, buy me something.
- I can't!

971
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:37,417
I didn't bring my card along.

972
01:01:37,458 --> 01:01:38,792
You didn't bring your card? Damn!

973
01:01:39,083 --> 01:01:41,042
I don't have cash either.
Anyway, I'll take a leak.

974
01:01:41,042 --> 01:01:43,375
I need to talk to you right here.
Don't go inside.

975
01:01:43,583 --> 01:01:45,958
Why not? I have to go! It's urgent!

976
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,583
Hey! Wait!

977
01:01:47,750 --> 01:01:50,125
I can control my anger, but not this.

978
01:01:50,458 --> 01:01:53,958
I'm sure you can control this, but
you can't control your anger.

979
01:02:03,458 --> 01:02:05,042
Are you out of your mind?

980
01:02:05,375 --> 01:02:06,375
Why did you do that?

981
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,708
- I'm sorry.
- Who asked you to come here?

982
01:02:09,208 --> 01:02:10,333
I asked her to come here.

983
01:02:10,750 --> 01:02:11,917
Kavin helped me.

984
01:02:14,458 --> 01:02:15,458
Kitty, let's leave.

985
01:02:16,417 --> 01:02:17,750
Raji, I need to talk to you.

986
01:02:19,250 --> 01:02:21,292
You've deleted his number from your phone.

987
01:02:21,833 --> 01:02:22,708
Let's leave.

988
01:02:22,917 --> 01:02:24,167
So what if she deleted my number?

989
01:02:25,375 --> 01:02:28,000
Didn't you ask me to return his gifts?

990
01:02:28,042 --> 01:02:29,042
Kitty, let's leave.

991
01:02:29,292 --> 01:02:30,917
She must have refused me because you.

992
01:02:31,833 --> 01:02:33,667
She could not have said she didn't like me.

993
01:02:38,292 --> 01:02:39,708
Kitty, do you like him?

994
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:51,417
You promised that you will marry
someone only if I like him as well.

995
01:02:52,458 --> 01:02:53,750
If I like someone

996
01:02:54,292 --> 01:02:55,583
you need to like him too.

997
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Only then I'll marry him.

998
01:02:57,500 --> 01:02:58,708
Why are you silent?

999
01:03:00,542 --> 01:03:02,583
- Promise?
- Promise.

1000
01:03:02,792 --> 01:03:03,792
I did!

1001
01:03:04,042 --> 01:03:05,958
But that was when you were
nine and you were crying.

1002
01:03:06,375 --> 01:03:07,958
Why do you keep holding on to that?

1003
01:03:08,458 --> 01:03:10,083
Can't someone change their mind?

1004
01:03:10,542 --> 01:03:11,625
Won't you grow up?

1005
01:03:14,792 --> 01:03:16,667
We're the same blood until we die!

1006
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,583
Even if you die, you'll still be my sister.

1007
01:03:18,917 --> 01:03:21,708
But the promise you made
changes with new people?

1008
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,458
Changes with time?

1009
01:03:28,083 --> 01:03:29,083
Kitty...

1010
01:03:29,333 --> 01:03:31,125
Whatever it is, let's go
home and talk, Kitty.

1011
01:03:31,792 --> 01:03:32,792
Let's go, Kitty...

1012
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:35,583
Raji, make your own choice this time.

1013
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:42,500
Blood...

1014
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:47,500
Not over there.

1015
01:03:48,042 --> 01:03:49,417
A glass must have pierced you.

1016
01:03:49,458 --> 01:03:50,542
No, it's alright.

1017
01:03:53,708 --> 01:03:54,875
I'm very sorry.

1018
01:03:55,875 --> 01:03:56,875
I'm extremely sorry.

1019
01:03:59,583 --> 01:04:01,583
Go with him already!

1020
01:04:01,583 --> 01:04:03,625
What the hell did you just say?

1021
01:04:03,667 --> 01:04:05,000
- Don't hit him!
- What did you just say?

1022
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:07,708
- Sister, let him go.
- What did you say to me?

1023
01:04:09,458 --> 01:04:10,875
- Madhan!
- Will you say that again?

1024
01:04:10,917 --> 01:04:12,833
- Where did that come from?
- Sister, let go of him.

1025
01:04:13,292 --> 01:04:15,125
- Tell me!
- Sister, please.

1026
01:04:16,583 --> 01:04:17,583
Sister, please...

1027
01:04:20,167 --> 01:04:21,917
Sister, please...

1028
01:04:23,792 --> 01:04:24,792
Don't cry.

1029
01:04:27,208 --> 01:04:28,625
Raji, please don't cry.

1030
01:04:30,625 --> 01:04:32,042
At least you tell me!

1031
01:04:32,083 --> 01:04:33,792
What is it with you two?

1032
01:04:50,583 --> 01:04:51,833
Did you race?

1033
01:04:52,292 --> 01:04:53,375
Did you?

1034
01:05:00,833 --> 01:05:01,833
Yes, I did.

1035
01:05:02,458 --> 01:05:04,000
But do you know what he did?

1036
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,792
He took a bribe from the opponent

1037
01:05:06,875 --> 01:05:07,875
and let them go.

1038
01:05:08,542 --> 01:05:09,542
But me...

1039
01:05:10,917 --> 01:05:12,250
A pant was available.

1040
01:05:12,417 --> 01:05:15,292
He deliberately made me wear
a nightie and insulted me.

1041
01:05:16,125 --> 01:05:19,750
He wanted to insult me in front of the public,
so he made me wear it and arrested me.

1042
01:05:20,417 --> 01:05:21,708
That didn't satisy him!

1043
01:05:22,917 --> 01:05:25,000
He uploaded it on YouTube as well.

1044
01:05:25,792 --> 01:05:27,708
It'll be on the internet even if I die.

1045
01:05:29,458 --> 01:05:30,125
Kitty...

1046
01:05:30,375 --> 01:05:32,167
Please come home with me.

1047
01:05:43,042 --> 01:05:43,792
Alright...

1048
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,917
I'll stop racing.

1049
01:05:46,375 --> 01:05:48,625
Come home with me. You don't need him.

1050
01:05:49,167 --> 01:05:50,417
Let's go home Kitty.

1051
01:05:52,167 --> 01:05:53,000
Come on, Kitty...

1052
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,208
- Yay!
- Put me down...

1053
01:07:15,875 --> 01:07:18,083
Hey there, loser. Get off the bike.

1054
01:07:18,458 --> 01:07:20,792
Hey, listen carefully.

1055
01:07:21,042 --> 01:07:23,000
There are no doubts on who
your brother-in-law is.

1056
01:07:23,833 --> 01:07:25,167
Until the end of the world

1057
01:07:26,208 --> 01:07:27,792
I'm your sister's husband

1058
01:07:29,417 --> 01:07:30,917
and you are my brother-in-law.

1059
01:07:36,958 --> 01:07:38,250
Let go of me!

1060
01:07:38,875 --> 01:07:40,125
Please don't hit me!

1061
01:07:44,542 --> 01:07:46,250
Please stop! It hurts!

1062
01:07:49,583 --> 01:07:50,583
Please don't beat me!

1063
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:03,208
Kitty...

1064
01:08:05,417 --> 01:08:07,000
Kitty...

1065
01:08:09,042 --> 01:08:10,708
Kitty...

1066
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,708
Congratulations brother-in-law!

1067
01:08:19,833 --> 01:08:21,750
Kitty...

1068
01:09:10,625 --> 01:09:11,333
Raji

1069
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:13,208
After you put up your honeymoon photos

1070
01:09:13,375 --> 01:09:15,083
the room looks great, right?

1071
01:09:15,958 --> 01:09:16,958
Thanks aunty.

1072
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,458
What's with the formality?

1073
01:09:19,792 --> 01:09:20,792
And what's that?

1074
01:09:21,042 --> 01:09:21,708
Let me see.

1075
01:09:25,458 --> 01:09:26,542
This is my brother and I.

1076
01:09:26,708 --> 01:09:27,208
Oh.

1077
01:09:28,625 --> 01:09:30,875
He's your only brother, right? You
must have been like a mother to him.

1078
01:09:35,875 --> 01:09:37,000
But I wasn't a mother.

1079
01:09:39,375 --> 01:09:40,375
I couldn't be one.

1080
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:41,542
I couldn't.

1081
01:09:41,792 --> 01:09:43,167
I became a lover.

1082
01:09:46,667 --> 01:09:48,333
I had to become a wife.

1083
01:09:50,833 --> 01:09:52,000
I couldn't be a mother

1084
01:09:53,542 --> 01:09:55,000
forever.

1085
01:09:55,667 --> 01:09:57,583
Only mothers can do that.

1086
01:09:58,583 --> 01:09:59,708
I feel sad for my brother.

1087
01:10:00,875 --> 01:10:01,417
His trust

1088
01:10:02,167 --> 01:10:03,167
would have been shattered.

1089
01:10:06,792 --> 01:10:07,542
Let that go.

1090
01:10:08,292 --> 01:10:09,333
Listen, Raji...

1091
01:10:09,542 --> 01:10:10,875
More than a sister and brother's bond

1092
01:10:11,333 --> 01:10:13,333
bonds between brothers-in-law are stronger.

1093
01:10:15,417 --> 01:10:16,750
I'm not saying this to please you.

1094
01:10:17,625 --> 01:10:19,042
People who are good friends

1095
01:10:19,250 --> 01:10:20,583
when they become closer

1096
01:10:20,667 --> 01:10:22,333
they treat each other
like brothers-in-law.

1097
01:10:23,292 --> 01:10:25,833
That very bond will reunite
you with your brother.

1098
01:10:29,042 --> 01:10:29,625
Hey!

1099
01:10:29,917 --> 01:10:31,167
How was the blend?

1100
01:10:44,583 --> 01:10:45,708
Hey, move it!

1101
01:10:48,583 --> 01:10:49,417
What happened child?

1102
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:52,167
Her water bottle is with him.

1103
01:11:41,542 --> 01:11:42,208
Let me go!

1104
01:11:43,417 --> 01:11:43,958
Brother...

1105
01:11:44,208 --> 01:11:45,208
Give me a cigarette.

1106
01:11:46,542 --> 01:11:48,625
- You smoke?
- I'm starting today.

1107
01:11:56,083 --> 01:11:57,083
You, hit him!

1108
01:11:58,417 --> 01:11:59,708
I said thrash him!

1109
01:12:00,083 --> 01:12:00,708
Harder!

1110
01:12:01,583 --> 01:12:02,375
Keep at it!

1111
01:12:08,625 --> 01:12:09,667
Come on!

1112
01:12:12,208 --> 01:12:13,750
- Come on, you!
- Brother...

1113
01:12:14,042 --> 01:12:14,833
Come!

1114
01:12:16,917 --> 01:12:18,917
Come on! Thrash him!

1115
01:12:21,583 --> 01:12:22,583
Come on, hit him!

1116
01:12:23,375 --> 01:12:24,375
Come on!

1117
01:12:26,958 --> 01:12:27,792
Thrash him!

1118
01:12:38,542 --> 01:12:39,708
Hey, what the...?

1119
01:12:42,583 --> 01:12:43,917
Why is the damn bike here?

1120
01:12:44,458 --> 01:12:44,875
What?

1121
01:12:45,250 --> 01:12:46,125
How dare you?

1122
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,417
Who is this guy now?

1123
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:52,500
Thrash him first!

1124
01:13:02,875 --> 01:13:03,500
Tea...

1125
01:13:12,708 --> 01:13:13,625
Do you have butter biscuits?

1126
01:13:26,708 --> 01:13:27,625
Stop the vehicle!

1127
01:13:27,625 --> 01:13:29,208
Hey! Stop right there!

1128
01:13:29,292 --> 01:13:30,583
If I catch you!

1129
01:13:30,708 --> 01:13:31,708
Where do you think you're going?

1130
01:13:32,292 --> 01:13:33,667
This way. Stop running!

1131
01:13:48,542 --> 01:13:49,958
You've been like this for a few days.

1132
01:13:50,375 --> 01:13:51,542
Did you do something wrong?

1133
01:13:56,250 --> 01:13:57,250
I did something good.

1134
01:13:59,542 --> 01:14:00,792
But some people...

1135
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:02,792
Look...

1136
01:14:02,875 --> 01:14:04,542
If you want to change everyone

1137
01:14:04,625 --> 01:14:05,875
nothing good will come of it.

1138
01:14:05,917 --> 01:14:06,958
Just let it go and move on.

1139
01:14:15,750 --> 01:14:16,417
Remove your shirt.

1140
01:14:16,917 --> 01:14:18,875
- Sir, here's my license and papers.
- I said remove your shirt!

1141
01:14:24,792 --> 01:14:25,375
- Sir...
- Leave.

1142
01:14:25,875 --> 01:14:26,958
This is my original license.

1143
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,292
Just don't kill anyone.

1144
01:14:28,583 --> 01:14:29,375
That'll do. Leave.

1145
01:14:35,250 --> 01:14:36,500
Move it.

1146
01:14:38,042 --> 01:14:39,083
Come on!

1147
01:14:39,167 --> 01:14:40,625
Move it!

1148
01:14:41,333 --> 01:14:42,333
Get going!

1149
01:14:43,042 --> 01:14:43,875
Come on!

1150
01:14:51,667 --> 01:14:53,250
Shall we go to Pondicherry this week?

1151
01:14:53,292 --> 01:14:54,833
As if you'll take me.

1152
01:14:54,833 --> 01:14:57,000
This time we're going for sure!

1153
01:14:58,833 --> 01:14:59,917
Yes sir, it's the Traffic Sub-Inspector.

1154
01:15:05,250 --> 01:15:05,708
Sir?

1155
01:15:06,250 --> 01:15:06,958
Where are you coming from?

1156
01:15:07,250 --> 01:15:07,917
Mogappair, sir.

1157
01:15:10,708 --> 01:15:11,458
Where to?

1158
01:15:11,583 --> 01:15:12,125
Pallavaram.

1159
01:15:13,542 --> 01:15:14,667
Tell me the Hospital's name quickly.

1160
01:15:14,667 --> 01:15:15,667
Hospital...

1161
01:15:16,750 --> 01:15:17,208
Open it.

1162
01:15:17,417 --> 01:15:18,417
Sir...

1163
01:15:18,583 --> 01:15:19,625
There's a cancer patient inside.

1164
01:15:19,625 --> 01:15:21,292
So what, it's not locked is it?

1165
01:15:21,333 --> 01:15:22,083
Move it!

1166
01:15:22,375 --> 01:15:22,792
Sir...

1167
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:23,875
Sir...

1168
01:15:26,250 --> 01:15:26,792
Open it.

1169
01:15:27,875 --> 01:15:28,417
Sir?

1170
01:15:28,917 --> 01:15:30,125
What's the problem in opening it?

1171
01:15:30,708 --> 01:15:31,542
Open it!

1172
01:15:32,292 --> 01:15:33,708
Will you open it or shall I?

1173
01:15:36,583 --> 01:15:37,250
Open it!

1174
01:15:50,833 --> 01:15:51,542
Who are you?

1175
01:15:51,875 --> 01:15:52,208
Huh?

1176
01:15:52,583 --> 01:15:53,292
Customs?

1177
01:15:55,042 --> 01:15:56,292
Are you from the Crime Department?

1178
01:15:58,417 --> 01:16:00,125
Check if the vehicle's papers are fine.

1179
01:16:00,417 --> 01:16:02,167
Not what's inside.

1180
01:16:05,167 --> 01:16:09,167
We stop the common people
and pave way for ambulances.

1181
01:16:10,208 --> 01:16:13,625
Logically, we have the right
to know what's inside.

1182
01:16:14,750 --> 01:16:15,458
Also

1183
01:16:16,333 --> 01:16:20,458
If there's a crime, any of the 20,000
police officers in the city can intervene.

1184
01:16:20,542 --> 01:16:21,667
But no one's intervening.

1185
01:16:22,375 --> 01:16:23,458
No one except you.

1186
01:16:23,583 --> 01:16:25,542
These 20,000 police officers

1187
01:16:25,875 --> 01:16:26,792
are just for you.

1188
01:16:26,917 --> 01:16:27,875
One Commissioner

1189
01:16:28,208 --> 01:16:29,125
4 Additional Commissioners

1190
01:16:29,542 --> 01:16:30,417
8 Joint-Commissioners

1191
01:16:30,708 --> 01:16:32,042
12 Deputy Commissioners

1192
01:16:32,083 --> 01:16:34,167
These are the only police I know.

1193
01:16:37,083 --> 01:16:39,417
I talk to them as I sit cross-legged.

1194
01:16:40,208 --> 01:16:40,875
And you?

1195
01:16:42,250 --> 01:16:43,250
Stay at your level.

1196
01:16:43,917 --> 01:16:44,500
Hey!

1197
01:16:53,583 --> 01:16:55,958
Take a good look. It's filled with drugs.

1198
01:16:56,708 --> 01:17:01,125
I mix drugs in Ghutka and
Pan Masala and sell it.

1199
01:17:01,375 --> 01:17:03,208
There's no cancer patient inside.

1200
01:17:03,583 --> 01:17:05,083
Only cancer.

1201
01:17:07,917 --> 01:17:09,458
Do what you can.

1202
01:17:10,458 --> 01:17:11,458
- Hey
- Sir?

1203
01:17:11,792 --> 01:17:13,708
The next time someone stops our vehicle

1204
01:17:16,417 --> 01:17:18,500
what you do when a
dog comes in between

1205
01:17:19,167 --> 01:17:20,667
do the same and get going.

1206
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:40,667
Why are you making up stories? Did
someone steal your girlfriend?

1207
01:17:40,833 --> 01:17:42,208
I can't race whenever you call me.

1208
01:17:42,667 --> 01:17:44,083
- You guys lost, right?
- So?

1209
01:17:44,083 --> 01:17:46,833
- So wait.
- So many vehicles in the way!

1210
01:17:46,833 --> 01:17:49,667
- Bro, do you remember the
traffic cop in Saidapet? - Yes?

1211
01:17:49,667 --> 01:17:53,042
He shunned him and married his sister bro.

1212
01:17:53,083 --> 01:17:55,833
We call the cops brothers-in-law
just for fun bro.

1213
01:17:55,875 --> 01:17:58,125
But he really is his brother-in-law.

1214
01:17:58,167 --> 01:18:01,292
- Shut up with the big talk loser!
- Madhan!

1215
01:18:01,292 --> 01:18:02,667
What's that noise over there?

1216
01:18:03,083 --> 01:18:04,875
The shop is open but you're here...

1217
01:18:05,458 --> 01:18:07,958
- I thought I heard you guys fighting,
but you're playing? - Aunty!

1218
01:18:08,167 --> 01:18:11,333
- When did you come?
- There are so many of you!

1219
01:18:11,417 --> 01:18:12,750
Let me bring tea for everyone.

1220
01:18:16,667 --> 01:18:17,667
Children...

1221
01:18:17,958 --> 01:18:20,042
When does Madhan have
to come for the race?

1222
01:18:27,250 --> 01:18:28,750
- Hello?
- Tell me, Raji.

1223
01:18:28,833 --> 01:18:29,250
Aunty?

1224
01:18:29,542 --> 01:18:30,833
Why did you leave so early?

1225
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:32,000
That's no biggie.

1226
01:18:32,208 --> 01:18:32,958
Well...

1227
01:18:33,333 --> 01:18:34,083
Shall I tell her?

1228
01:18:34,375 --> 01:18:36,458
That you were about to
race with your peers?

1229
01:18:36,875 --> 01:18:37,667
- Shall I?
- Hello?

1230
01:18:37,875 --> 01:18:38,792
- Shall I tell her?
- Aunty?

1231
01:18:39,042 --> 01:18:39,708
Tell her.

1232
01:18:40,208 --> 01:18:40,750
Why?

1233
01:18:40,958 --> 01:18:42,500
- Hello?
- To spoil her peace?

1234
01:18:43,250 --> 01:18:43,875
Aunty?

1235
01:18:44,208 --> 01:18:44,958
Can you hear me?

1236
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,000
It's nothing...

1237
01:18:46,542 --> 01:18:48,833
Jaya called me and said her kid is unwell.

1238
01:18:48,958 --> 01:18:50,083
- Damn.
- I spoke to her.

1239
01:18:50,208 --> 01:18:51,208
Nothing to fear.

1240
01:18:51,708 --> 01:18:52,875
Madhan is with me.

1241
01:18:54,292 --> 01:18:55,042
Really?

1242
01:18:57,083 --> 01:18:58,500
Aunty What is he doing?

1243
01:19:01,125 --> 01:19:02,208
He's sleeping.

1244
01:19:02,250 --> 01:19:03,083
He's sleeping?

1245
01:19:04,708 --> 01:19:05,167
Aunty

1246
01:19:05,333 --> 01:19:06,708
Place the phone on his ear.

1247
01:19:07,917 --> 01:19:08,917
Uh...

1248
01:19:08,917 --> 01:19:10,125
Do it!

1249
01:19:11,083 --> 01:19:11,792
It's Raji!

1250
01:19:11,875 --> 01:19:13,167
- Hello? Madhan?
- Talk to her!

1251
01:19:14,042 --> 01:19:14,750
Talk to her!

1252
01:19:14,833 --> 01:19:16,042
- Hello?
- Talk to her!

1253
01:19:16,083 --> 01:19:17,417
- Damn it!
- Oh God!

1254
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
Hey! Stop the bus!

1255
01:19:20,083 --> 01:19:21,500
Hey! Get up!

1256
01:19:21,583 --> 01:19:22,625
Hey, stop the bus!

1257
01:19:24,583 --> 01:19:26,958
Something has gotten into him.
He just threw it!

1258
01:19:30,583 --> 01:19:31,792
Check every seat!

1259
01:19:32,250 --> 01:19:33,250
Sir, he's here!

1260
01:19:33,583 --> 01:19:34,875
- Why are you taking me?
- Get up!

1261
01:19:34,958 --> 01:19:36,000
Sir, tell me what it is!

1262
01:19:36,042 --> 01:19:36,875
Oh God! Madhan!

1263
01:19:36,917 --> 01:19:38,250
- Move it!
- Sir, why are you taking me?

1264
01:19:38,250 --> 01:19:40,083
- Stay quiet.
- I need to know, sir.

1265
01:19:40,083 --> 01:19:42,417
- Just get inside.
- Sir, why are you taking him?

1266
01:19:42,542 --> 01:19:44,292
- Why are you taking me?
- I said get inside.

1267
01:19:44,583 --> 01:19:45,083
Sir?

1268
01:19:45,458 --> 01:19:48,042
- Sir, tell me...
- Why are you taking him, sir?

1269
01:19:48,083 --> 01:19:48,875
- Go away!
- Sir, why?

1270
01:19:48,917 --> 01:19:50,625
- Go away!
- Sir, what did he do?

1271
01:19:50,667 --> 01:19:52,292
Visit the police station and find out.

1272
01:19:52,292 --> 01:19:54,708
Stop following us. Leave.

1273
01:19:54,833 --> 01:19:55,833
Go away!

1274
01:19:57,750 --> 01:20:00,708
- Tell us the truth!
- Sir, we don't know anything!

1275
01:20:00,750 --> 01:20:02,292
Sir, it hurts!

1276
01:20:02,333 --> 01:20:04,667
- Are you going to confess or not?
- Sir, it wasn't us!

1277
01:20:04,667 --> 01:20:06,417
If they imprison you, you
can't get out for 3 years.

1278
01:20:06,458 --> 01:20:07,792
- Speak up!
- Sir, it wasn't our fault!

1279
01:20:07,958 --> 01:20:10,458
Everyone's been fed well by your mothers!

1280
01:20:10,667 --> 01:20:12,125
Sir, Greetings!

1281
01:20:14,125 --> 01:20:15,375
Sir, don't beat us!

1282
01:20:15,542 --> 01:20:17,792
Rascals! You have five minutes to speak up!

1283
01:20:17,917 --> 01:20:19,750
Greetings, sir. I'm the Traffic
Sub-Inspector for Saidapet.

1284
01:20:19,792 --> 01:20:21,250
I know, Rajasekar. Sit down.

1285
01:20:21,417 --> 01:20:23,583
You've come here in person.
What is it?

1286
01:20:23,958 --> 01:20:25,667
You arrested someone on the Hosur bus.

1287
01:20:25,750 --> 01:20:26,417
He's my...

1288
01:20:27,375 --> 01:20:28,417
Wife's brother.

1289
01:20:28,708 --> 01:20:29,708
What's the complaint?

1290
01:20:30,167 --> 01:20:30,875
I'll tell you.

1291
01:20:31,292 --> 01:20:32,792
What do you mean wife's brother?

1292
01:20:33,083 --> 01:20:34,250
You could have said he's
your brother-in-law.

1293
01:20:34,583 --> 01:20:36,542
Hey, which one of you
is his brother in law?

1294
01:20:37,125 --> 01:20:38,125
I'm talking to you!

1295
01:20:38,333 --> 01:20:40,375
- It's him.
- Doesn't he have a mouth?

1296
01:20:41,042 --> 01:20:42,792
Sir, he's the main culprit.

1297
01:20:42,833 --> 01:20:44,833
They've stolen jewels
from the Judge's wife.

1298
01:20:48,208 --> 01:20:52,083
The bike used for the theft
belongs to your brother-in-law.

1299
01:20:52,167 --> 01:20:55,458
But he says they park the
race-bikes in a garage.

1300
01:20:55,458 --> 01:20:57,250
And that someone must have stolen it.

1301
01:20:57,292 --> 01:20:58,292
There's a lot of pressure.

1302
01:20:58,417 --> 01:21:01,833
Either you talk to them
and make them confess

1303
01:21:01,958 --> 01:21:04,000
or I'll file an FIR against them all

1304
01:21:04,417 --> 01:21:05,542
and produce them in Court.

1305
01:21:05,667 --> 01:21:06,792
You take care of it from there.

1306
01:21:07,708 --> 01:21:09,042
Your phone's ringing. Attend it.

1307
01:21:09,917 --> 01:21:10,917
What happened?

1308
01:21:11,333 --> 01:21:12,208
I just reached.

1309
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:14,250
I have to check what the issue is.

1310
01:21:15,083 --> 01:21:16,292
He's very young.

1311
01:21:18,708 --> 01:21:19,750
Raji don't cry, please.

1312
01:21:22,542 --> 01:21:23,792
Did they beat him up?

1313
01:21:24,292 --> 01:21:25,917
They won't imprison him, right?

1314
01:21:26,042 --> 01:21:27,333
I said I'll take care of it.

1315
01:21:28,083 --> 01:21:29,000
Please babe.

1316
01:21:29,958 --> 01:21:32,750
Get him out of there somehow, please.

1317
01:21:32,750 --> 01:21:34,000
Okay, I'll call you back.

1318
01:21:34,583 --> 01:21:35,042
Sorry.

1319
01:21:37,750 --> 01:21:39,500
Is there no other way?

1320
01:21:39,875 --> 01:21:41,333
You're newly-wed, right?

1321
01:21:41,625 --> 01:21:42,208
I understand.

1322
01:21:42,667 --> 01:21:44,417
Everyone respects you.

1323
01:21:44,833 --> 01:21:49,792
It's no mean feat to be selected by
Central Vigilance at such a young age.

1324
01:21:51,208 --> 01:21:51,792
Dhanapal!

1325
01:21:51,833 --> 01:21:53,250
- Sir?
- Check what that noise is about.

1326
01:21:53,625 --> 01:21:54,042
Come with me.

1327
01:21:56,167 --> 01:21:58,875
People don't help each other
within the Department.

1328
01:21:59,000 --> 01:21:59,833
I don't know why.

1329
01:21:59,958 --> 01:22:01,792
I'll handle this case differently.

1330
01:22:01,875 --> 01:22:02,542
Do as I say.

1331
01:22:03,417 --> 01:22:04,417
At your own risk

1332
01:22:04,542 --> 01:22:05,417
take your brother-in-law

1333
01:22:05,542 --> 01:22:07,833
and keep him in your house
under your custody.

1334
01:22:09,458 --> 01:22:11,000
He must be available for
enquiry at all times.

1335
01:22:12,042 --> 01:22:14,125
I don't trust him. I trust you.

1336
01:22:15,917 --> 01:22:17,708
Write it down and take him, Rajasekar.

1337
01:22:28,083 --> 01:22:29,625
Sir, we loathe each other.

1338
01:22:30,417 --> 01:22:31,833
How can I take him home?

1339
01:22:32,333 --> 01:22:34,292
It's not possible. I'm leaving.

1340
01:22:35,042 --> 01:22:35,458
Thanks.

1341
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:38,875
Constable, prepare the FIR for these boys.

1342
01:22:38,917 --> 01:22:40,458
Sir...

1343
01:22:41,167 --> 01:22:41,667
Sir...

1344
01:22:41,917 --> 01:22:43,958
Sir, we're Madhan's friends' parents.

1345
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,542
Our children are irresponsible.

1346
01:22:46,625 --> 01:22:48,167
They drive fast.

1347
01:22:48,375 --> 01:22:49,958
But they're not thieves.

1348
01:22:50,625 --> 01:22:53,958
As soon as you arrived, we
thought they will be set free.

1349
01:22:54,250 --> 01:22:56,708
But even you are leaving in anger.

1350
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:58,917
My wife needs a C-section.

1351
01:22:59,875 --> 01:23:01,542
As I was returning after taking
a loan from the pawn shop

1352
01:23:01,750 --> 01:23:02,667
they nabbed me.

1353
01:23:06,208 --> 01:23:07,125
Look, Madhan.

1354
01:23:08,417 --> 01:23:09,500
If the cops find out

1355
01:23:09,833 --> 01:23:11,167
they will take all of it.

1356
01:23:12,083 --> 01:23:13,375
If your child is sad

1357
01:23:14,292 --> 01:23:14,792
it's the end.

1358
01:23:15,458 --> 01:23:16,750
If he doesn't eat for a week

1359
01:23:17,375 --> 01:23:17,958
you can't handle it.

1360
01:23:18,167 --> 01:23:19,167
How long will he stay hungry?

1361
01:23:19,917 --> 01:23:21,917
You don't have to buy them an
expensive bike to calm them down.

1362
01:23:22,875 --> 01:23:24,625
They'll end up racing and
this is how it'll end.

1363
01:23:25,042 --> 01:23:26,083
Do any of these kids have a license?

1364
01:23:28,917 --> 01:23:29,583
Sir...

1365
01:23:29,917 --> 01:23:31,042
We made a mistake.

1366
01:23:31,792 --> 01:23:33,000
Forgive us this time.

1367
01:23:33,958 --> 01:23:35,250
Even if we have to break their bones

1368
01:23:35,417 --> 01:23:37,042
we'll make sure they don't race again.

1369
01:23:37,167 --> 01:23:41,417
If you stay at your sister's place for
a while, we can all get out of this.

1370
01:23:41,625 --> 01:23:44,292
Madhan, I have an exam from tomorrow.

1371
01:24:18,167 --> 01:24:19,208
My life...

1372
01:24:19,875 --> 01:24:21,625
You have left me

1373
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:24,167
My heart...

1374
01:24:24,500 --> 01:24:27,167
You've cut me into pieces
Come in...

1375
01:24:28,167 --> 01:24:29,167
My life...

1376
01:24:29,833 --> 01:24:31,333
He's gonna stay here for a few days.
You have left me

1377
01:24:33,208 --> 01:24:34,208
My heart...

1378
01:24:34,375 --> 01:24:36,708
You've cut me into pieces

1379
01:24:37,833 --> 01:24:40,583
The pain that you've given me

1380
01:24:40,625 --> 01:24:42,875
The anger that you displayed
- Who's this? - My brother.

1381
01:24:42,917 --> 01:24:46,625
Still lurks within

1382
01:24:47,875 --> 01:24:50,375
The love I gave you

1383
01:24:50,458 --> 01:24:53,083
The care I showed you

1384
01:24:53,083 --> 01:24:56,458
Do you still feel it?

1385
01:25:00,125 --> 01:25:00,875
One!

1386
01:25:01,083 --> 01:25:02,000
Two!

1387
01:25:02,458 --> 01:25:03,167
Three!

1388
01:25:03,917 --> 01:25:04,708
Four!

1389
01:25:05,292 --> 01:25:06,042
Five!

1390
01:25:06,542 --> 01:25:07,167
Six!

1391
01:25:07,833 --> 01:25:08,583
Seven!

1392
01:25:08,667 --> 01:25:09,750
My life...

1393
01:25:10,333 --> 01:25:12,250
You have left me

1394
01:25:13,667 --> 01:25:14,708
My heart...

1395
01:25:15,083 --> 01:25:17,458
You've cut me into pieces

1396
01:25:41,417 --> 01:25:46,500
Like an island that's abandoned
Come and eat, Madhan.

1397
01:25:46,500 --> 01:25:49,417
My life has become...

1398
01:25:51,042 --> 01:25:52,208
Identify the culprit.

1399
01:25:52,250 --> 01:25:54,083
I placed my trust

1400
01:25:54,500 --> 01:25:56,333
My child is born.
In a flower with no roots

1401
01:25:56,375 --> 01:25:59,250
- Not curious? - Very important!
And came crashing down.

1402
01:26:00,583 --> 01:26:05,958
Even if its feathers happen to fall

1403
01:26:06,250 --> 01:26:10,375
The birds won't look for them

1404
01:26:10,917 --> 01:26:13,792
Despite falling off

1405
01:26:13,792 --> 01:26:16,208
the feathers

1406
01:26:16,250 --> 01:26:20,667
never forget the birds.

1407
01:26:20,708 --> 01:26:23,875
Sir, my bike was stolen. The Police
recovered it from this street.

1408
01:26:24,083 --> 01:26:26,875
If we check your CCTV footage, we
can find out who the culprit is.

1409
01:26:26,917 --> 01:26:28,208
Help me sir, please.

1410
01:26:28,292 --> 01:26:29,375
Brother...

1411
01:26:29,625 --> 01:26:30,625
That one?

1412
01:26:30,917 --> 01:26:33,208
That's not even a camera. It's a dummy.

1413
01:26:33,458 --> 01:26:35,875
- It's just to scare thieves.
- Okay.

1414
01:26:35,917 --> 01:26:40,667
Why haven't the memories faded?
Why don't I feel like crying?

1415
01:26:40,708 --> 01:26:45,125
I'm like the shards of a broken mirror

1416
01:26:45,708 --> 01:26:48,292
Go away. I'll become a lonely tree.

1417
01:26:48,292 --> 01:26:50,792
Go away. Who else do I have?

1418
01:26:50,833 --> 01:26:55,250
Go away. I don't need anyone else.

1419
01:26:59,292 --> 01:27:00,125
Sweetheart!

1420
01:27:01,167 --> 01:27:02,583
For the happiness you've given me

1421
01:27:02,958 --> 01:27:04,667
I don't know what to give you!

1422
01:27:05,417 --> 01:27:06,542
Why don't you tell me, please?

1423
01:27:07,167 --> 01:27:09,000
We can't help you with everything.

1424
01:27:09,917 --> 01:27:13,000
It's exciting for women to wonder
what their husbands will gift them.

1425
01:27:13,708 --> 01:27:14,542
Think about it.

1426
01:27:14,958 --> 01:27:18,042
One day, the lights in this
police-brain will turn green.

1427
01:27:20,583 --> 01:27:21,542
My life...

1428
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,333
Talk to him.
You have left me

1429
01:27:25,417 --> 01:27:29,375
He doesn't come out. Go.
My heart, you've cut me into pieces.

1430
01:27:30,125 --> 01:27:32,583
The pain that you've given me

1431
01:27:32,625 --> 01:27:35,167
Talk to me.
The anger that you displayed

1432
01:27:35,167 --> 01:27:37,667
Madhan, I'm a sister too.
Still lurks in me

1433
01:27:37,833 --> 01:27:39,958
Don't play 'hard to get'.
I have a brother too.

1434
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:41,292
It's not enough if he's
just your brother.

1435
01:27:41,292 --> 01:27:43,125
He must have been a
father to his sister.

1436
01:27:43,125 --> 01:27:45,375
The love I gave you and
the care I showed you

1437
01:27:45,375 --> 01:27:48,750
Do you still feel it?

1438
01:28:00,375 --> 01:28:02,292
My life...

1439
01:28:02,958 --> 01:28:05,167
My heart...
Give me two. Thanks.

1440
01:28:09,667 --> 01:28:11,250
My life...

1441
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:12,750
Eat up!

1442
01:28:12,792 --> 01:28:15,333
- For me?
- Hold on, I'm getting it.

1443
01:28:17,958 --> 01:28:18,500
Here.

1444
01:28:18,625 --> 01:28:19,875
- You've paid for two.
- I don't want it now.

1445
01:28:19,917 --> 01:28:21,375
- Brother...
- I don't want it.

1446
01:28:21,375 --> 01:28:22,708
- What happened?
- Go away!

1447
01:28:29,083 --> 01:28:30,542
- Mom, it's Raji.
- Give it.

1448
01:28:31,292 --> 01:28:31,875
Talk to her.

1449
01:28:32,292 --> 01:28:34,625
- Talk to her!
- Why me? You talk to her.

1450
01:28:34,958 --> 01:28:36,375
I can't hear her speak.

1451
01:28:36,417 --> 01:28:38,583
The deal was that I'll tell
your family, which I did.

1452
01:28:38,625 --> 01:28:40,000
Now you tell my family.

1453
01:28:40,042 --> 01:28:41,667
- Tell them!
- Do you want that baby?

1454
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:42,542
Dad will buy that for you.

1455
01:28:42,542 --> 01:28:43,958
- Hello?
- Raji, are you fine?

1456
01:28:44,417 --> 01:28:45,833
Hi Aunty, it's not Raji.

1457
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,542
- It's Rajasekhar.
- Son, how are you?

1458
01:28:48,542 --> 01:28:49,542
Tell me...

1459
01:28:49,750 --> 01:28:50,542
The thing is...

1460
01:28:51,167 --> 01:28:52,167
Raji...

1461
01:28:52,208 --> 01:28:54,167
- She's been two months...
- Tell her!

1462
01:28:54,750 --> 01:28:56,458
Raji is two months...

1463
01:28:56,458 --> 01:28:57,458
she's been carrying...

1464
01:28:57,542 --> 01:28:59,000
- a baby...
- Son!

1465
01:28:59,458 --> 01:29:00,458
Thanks!

1466
01:29:00,542 --> 01:29:01,958
Thank you very much!

1467
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:02,667
Thanks?

1468
01:29:03,167 --> 01:29:04,625
Why is she thanking me?

1469
01:29:04,667 --> 01:29:06,417
- Raji's pregnant!
- Mom!

1470
01:29:06,458 --> 01:29:08,708
- Then you should say 'Congratulations'.
- Okay.

1471
01:29:09,208 --> 01:29:11,292
Son, you've completed a humongous job!

1472
01:29:11,458 --> 01:29:12,542
I mean, you did it...

1473
01:29:12,625 --> 01:29:14,458
I mean, you've told me...

1474
01:29:17,667 --> 01:29:20,667
Son-in-law is laughing, I
don't know what to say.

1475
01:29:21,500 --> 01:29:22,500
Thanks, aunty.

1476
01:29:22,917 --> 01:29:26,000
Also, I need to buy Raji a nice gift.
Tell me what to buy her.

1477
01:29:26,042 --> 01:29:27,292
- I'm not listening!
- Give it to Raji.

1478
01:29:27,542 --> 01:29:28,958
- She's right here.
- I won't listen!

1479
01:29:28,958 --> 01:29:31,333
- I won't listen!
- Tell us aunty!

1480
01:29:31,375 --> 01:29:32,542
- Tell me son...
- Hey!

1481
01:29:32,708 --> 01:29:34,833
Aunty, think of something
nice, I'll call you later...

1482
01:29:34,833 --> 01:29:36,125
Give the phone to Raji.

1483
01:30:03,125 --> 01:30:06,292
It's exciting for women to wonder
what their husbands will gift them.

1484
01:30:06,792 --> 01:30:07,792
Think about it.

1485
01:30:08,125 --> 01:30:11,375
One day, the lights in this
police-brain will turn green.

1486
01:30:55,083 --> 01:30:55,792
What mom?

1487
01:30:56,208 --> 01:30:57,417
You seem to be into the nightie.

1488
01:30:58,292 --> 01:30:58,917
Sit down.

1489
01:30:59,875 --> 01:31:00,458
What happened?

1490
01:31:01,875 --> 01:31:03,042
Raji told me everything.

1491
01:31:03,292 --> 01:31:04,625
That her brother raced

1492
01:31:04,792 --> 01:31:06,292
and how you made him wear a nightie

1493
01:31:06,458 --> 01:31:07,458
and insulted him?

1494
01:31:08,167 --> 01:31:11,542
When we wear your pants,
we feel it's comfortable.

1495
01:31:11,708 --> 01:31:12,750
When we wear your shirts

1496
01:31:13,208 --> 01:31:15,792
we feel proud to wear a man's shirt.

1497
01:31:16,208 --> 01:31:19,917
Even when we dry your briefs, we don't
feel ashamed. We do it wholeheartedly.

1498
01:31:20,958 --> 01:31:23,833
But you men feel insulted
in a woman's clothes is it?

1499
01:31:24,792 --> 01:31:26,833
We're such an irrelevant species, right?

1500
01:31:29,500 --> 01:31:32,375
Isn't it something your
mothers and sisters wear?

1501
01:31:32,667 --> 01:31:33,208
Mom

1502
01:31:34,250 --> 01:31:35,417
He's the one who feels that way.

1503
01:31:36,292 --> 01:31:37,292
I'm talking about you.

1504
01:31:38,042 --> 01:31:41,500
Don't you think that it's an insult
for a man to wear a woman's clothes?

1505
01:31:43,917 --> 01:31:46,500
Only because you felt that way
you made him wear it, right?

1506
01:31:49,208 --> 01:31:51,583
He's six years your junior.

1507
01:31:52,667 --> 01:31:54,625
Change yourself first. Stay grounded.

1508
01:31:59,750 --> 01:32:01,458
- Sir, please sir.
- That's not possible.

1509
01:32:01,583 --> 01:32:05,542
- Let me just ask them once, please!
- No way, now leave!

1510
01:32:10,917 --> 01:32:12,750
- Madhan
- Tell me, aunty.

1511
01:32:13,292 --> 01:32:15,958
I have good news. Raji...

1512
01:32:17,083 --> 01:32:18,458
What's that noise?

1513
01:32:18,750 --> 01:32:19,750
Sorry bro.

1514
01:32:20,458 --> 01:32:22,417
- Sorry, I didn't hear.
- Raji...

1515
01:32:22,458 --> 01:32:23,458
Just hang up!

1516
01:32:23,667 --> 01:32:25,000
If you talk about her again

1517
01:32:25,042 --> 01:32:27,083
I'll block your number just like
I blocked her's.

1518
01:32:38,417 --> 01:32:40,750
Stop! Pull over.

1519
01:32:40,792 --> 01:32:42,708
- Produce your papers.
- What's the load?

1520
01:32:42,958 --> 01:32:43,958
Just clothes, sir.

1521
01:32:44,667 --> 01:32:45,250
What?

1522
01:32:46,417 --> 01:32:47,417
Clothes...

1523
01:32:47,958 --> 01:32:49,667
- There's nothing other than clothes, sir.
- Sir...

1524
01:32:49,667 --> 01:32:51,708
- Check our papers, sir.
- Sir...please...

1525
01:33:03,417 --> 01:33:06,125
Son, it's been half-an-hour
since I kept the food.

1526
01:33:06,583 --> 01:33:08,458
I need to wash the dishes and get home.

1527
01:33:21,208 --> 01:33:24,000
Standing in front of me;
trying to talk to me;

1528
01:33:24,042 --> 01:33:27,125
making mini-dosas;
if you keep doing these things

1529
01:33:27,625 --> 01:33:29,917
I'll forget my friends and go
back to the police station.

1530
01:33:30,125 --> 01:33:30,792
Hey!

1531
01:33:31,750 --> 01:33:34,083
- Why are you talking like that?
- I wasn't talking to you.

1532
01:33:34,583 --> 01:33:36,500
- I'm asking who you were talking to.
- It's her!

1533
01:33:36,667 --> 01:33:38,625
The one who sent me mini-dosas.

1534
01:33:40,167 --> 01:33:42,333
- Who is it?
- I don't know!

1535
01:33:53,083 --> 01:33:54,792
I knew you'd make amends.

1536
01:33:55,042 --> 01:33:56,667
But this is overdoing it.

1537
01:33:56,875 --> 01:33:58,583
Making dosas for him.

1538
01:34:00,208 --> 01:34:01,958
It might get burnt. Give it to him.

1539
01:34:19,208 --> 01:34:19,833
Sir

1540
01:34:20,208 --> 01:34:21,208
Wait a minute.

1541
01:34:22,833 --> 01:34:23,667
May I come in, sir?

1542
01:34:24,417 --> 01:34:25,625
What's wrong with you, man?

1543
01:34:25,750 --> 01:34:27,167
What's your problem with Madhusudhan?

1544
01:34:27,292 --> 01:34:28,958
The other day it was the Ambulance.

1545
01:34:28,958 --> 01:34:31,750
Now it's his container. You even
called the media on your own.

1546
01:34:31,792 --> 01:34:34,375
- He's committing crimes in his vehicles.
- Yes he is.

1547
01:34:34,417 --> 01:34:36,625
He didn't do it in your house.
It was on the road.

1548
01:34:36,708 --> 01:34:38,750
- Both are the same for me.
- What's with the road-talk?

1549
01:34:38,792 --> 01:34:41,000
People keep spitting and
urinating on the roads.

1550
01:34:41,042 --> 01:34:42,458
The public doesn't follow the rules.

1551
01:34:43,167 --> 01:34:45,208
The fault is ours, not the public's.

1552
01:34:45,625 --> 01:34:47,000
We need to show the people.

1553
01:34:47,500 --> 01:34:48,583
Like foreign countries.

1554
01:34:48,625 --> 01:34:50,708
Why are you defending yourself?

1555
01:34:50,708 --> 01:34:52,958
- Is it the ego of having worked
at the Centre? - Rajasekar

1556
01:34:53,167 --> 01:34:55,292
You're working in the
middle of the road.

1557
01:34:56,333 --> 01:34:58,708
Is it so insulting to
work on the roads?

1558
01:34:59,042 --> 01:34:59,542
No, sir.

1559
01:35:00,083 --> 01:35:02,833
It's a bridge for people
to meet and accomplish.

1560
01:35:03,208 --> 01:35:05,750
To understand a country, you
don't have to go inside houses.

1561
01:35:06,208 --> 01:35:07,875
The road will tell you
how the country is.

1562
01:35:08,417 --> 01:35:09,417
The road is my office.

1563
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:11,208
The blazing sun is my A/C.

1564
01:35:12,042 --> 01:35:13,583
Even the cemetery is religion-based.

1565
01:35:14,042 --> 01:35:18,792
But only the signal with its 3 red, yellow
and green eyes is not religion-based.

1566
01:35:19,625 --> 01:35:20,625
Every day

1567
01:35:20,750 --> 01:35:24,375
the thought of having made a father
spend 5 more minutes with his child

1568
01:35:24,625 --> 01:35:28,875
and knowing I've made a sister from another
mother reach on time, helps me sleep well.

1569
01:35:29,458 --> 01:35:33,292
Every year more than 150,000
people die in road accidents.

1570
01:35:33,875 --> 01:35:35,250
Tamil Nadu ranks first.

1571
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:37,000
13,000 people.

1572
01:35:37,625 --> 01:35:39,208
This is only the death-rate.

1573
01:35:39,500 --> 01:35:41,417
The injured and those
in coma are different.

1574
01:35:41,708 --> 01:35:44,625
Last year 197 people died on
the roads I was in-charge of.

1575
01:35:44,792 --> 01:35:45,542
This year

1576
01:35:46,083 --> 01:35:47,208
173 people.

1577
01:35:47,417 --> 01:35:50,208
24 people are living today because
of me and that gives me job satis...

1578
01:35:55,375 --> 01:35:56,167
That's what this is.

1579
01:35:56,833 --> 01:35:58,417
That's what gives me courage
to speak like this.

1580
01:35:58,750 --> 01:36:00,458
It makes me want to prevent crime.

1581
01:36:01,208 --> 01:36:05,208
The guy who's peddling life-threatening
things on a life-saving ambulance!

1582
01:36:06,625 --> 01:36:09,625
- Hey, what can you do to me?
- Sir, please...

1583
01:36:09,917 --> 01:36:12,500
- What will you do? Shoot me?
- Sir, please...

1584
01:36:12,583 --> 01:36:15,208
You can't do shit! You're
not even a cop to me!

1585
01:36:15,333 --> 01:36:18,125
Do you have a gun? I do! Come on!

1586
01:36:18,167 --> 01:36:20,083
Shall we? Will you arrest me?

1587
01:36:20,083 --> 01:36:21,958
- Will you arrest me?
- Get your hands off the uniform!

1588
01:36:23,500 --> 01:36:24,500
I said get your hands off it!

1589
01:36:24,583 --> 01:36:26,875
Sir, we'll talk it out.
Please listen to us.

1590
01:36:27,292 --> 01:36:28,333
Try imprisoning me!

1591
01:36:29,167 --> 01:36:30,167
Not just you.

1592
01:36:30,958 --> 01:36:32,250
I'll imprison your entire family.

1593
01:36:32,708 --> 01:36:36,042
- Sir! - Let go of me!
- Give me the gun! - Listen to us!

1594
01:36:36,750 --> 01:36:37,958
Wait, just a minute.

1595
01:36:42,583 --> 01:36:44,042
I don't have a family.

1596
01:36:45,292 --> 01:36:47,208
But I'll give you the chance of a lifetime!

1597
01:36:48,667 --> 01:36:49,667
One day.

1598
01:36:49,833 --> 01:36:51,042
Just one day.

1599
01:36:52,167 --> 01:36:53,167
Try imprisoning me.

1600
01:36:57,208 --> 01:37:00,083
You can't even put my dog in a jail.

1601
01:37:03,542 --> 01:37:05,292
He thinks he can arrest me!

1602
01:37:08,792 --> 01:37:10,458
What? Why are you silent?

1603
01:37:10,833 --> 01:37:11,833
Challenge me!

1604
01:37:12,333 --> 01:37:13,333
Challenge me!

1605
01:37:14,125 --> 01:37:15,125
You challenge me.

1606
01:37:16,167 --> 01:37:17,167
I'll win.

1607
01:37:20,458 --> 01:37:21,750
If we're done, can I leave, sir?

1608
01:37:32,833 --> 01:37:33,833
- Bye, sister.
- Bye.

1609
01:37:34,167 --> 01:37:35,625
- Bye dad.
- Be careful.

1610
01:37:35,625 --> 01:37:37,375
Hey, I'm on my way.

1611
01:37:38,250 --> 01:37:39,458
I got into the auto-rickshaw.

1612
01:37:39,583 --> 01:37:41,833
I'll be there in five
minutes, okay? Bye.

1613
01:38:15,875 --> 01:38:20,250
Is this the day...

1614
01:38:20,833 --> 01:38:25,250
We've been waiting for?
To see each other?

1615
01:38:25,792 --> 01:38:30,625
Is this the day...

1616
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:35,333
We've been waiting for?
To reunite?

1617
01:38:35,792 --> 01:38:41,042
Will I fall for those looks?
Will I ever let you go?

1618
01:38:41,083 --> 01:38:46,125
Can I ever forget the love
that brought us together?

1619
01:38:46,125 --> 01:38:51,042
Will I be next to you?
Will I be part of your life?

1620
01:38:51,042 --> 01:38:56,458
I wonder, like the last drop on the
edge of a leaf, anticipating its fall.

1621
01:38:57,167 --> 01:39:00,292
I swear I'll make you race with me!

1622
01:39:05,542 --> 01:39:10,292
I need to be next to you whenever I want

1623
01:39:10,333 --> 01:39:14,958
I need to hold you close
to me when we're together

1624
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:22,875
I need to drown in your
presence, my life...

1625
01:39:45,500 --> 01:39:49,917
You heart is like that of a
child that throws tantrums

1626
01:39:50,083 --> 01:39:55,250
I wish to hold and nurture that child

1627
01:39:55,333 --> 01:40:00,042
I lose myself in your laughter

1628
01:40:00,083 --> 01:40:05,792
It is melody to my ears

1629
01:40:06,167 --> 01:40:11,292
My life aches to live for you

1630
01:40:11,333 --> 01:40:15,500
Only the thought of you
helps me get through

1631
01:40:15,500 --> 01:40:17,875
I see you in everything

1632
01:40:17,875 --> 01:40:20,958
I see you in everything

1633
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:22,708
Go away...

1634
01:40:25,833 --> 01:40:30,750
Is this the day?

1635
01:40:31,042 --> 01:40:35,125
We've been waiting for?
To reunite?

1636
01:40:36,083 --> 01:40:40,958
I need to be next to you whenever I want

1637
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:45,583
I need to hold you close
to me when we're together

1638
01:40:50,375 --> 01:40:53,958
My life...
Two minutes.

1639
01:40:58,083 --> 01:40:58,792
Bye.

1640
01:41:11,083 --> 01:41:12,958
You think I betrayed you, right?

1641
01:41:20,042 --> 01:41:20,667
Okay.

1642
01:41:23,708 --> 01:41:25,250
Madhan, look at me.

1643
01:41:26,708 --> 01:41:28,167
Just like we travelled today

1644
01:41:28,667 --> 01:41:30,667
I want to travel with you all my life.

1645
01:41:37,292 --> 01:41:38,125
I'll be waiting.

1646
01:41:41,875 --> 01:41:42,625
When?

1647
01:41:44,167 --> 01:41:44,833
When?

1648
01:41:46,250 --> 01:41:47,375
I'll get there right now!

1649
01:42:07,375 --> 01:42:08,083
Aunty...

1650
01:42:14,708 --> 01:42:15,542
Aunty...

1651
01:42:20,167 --> 01:42:24,667
These two things were supposed to happen
at Raji's wedding. But it didn't happen.

1652
01:42:27,958 --> 01:42:29,792
This is the ring you need to
give your brother-in-law.

1653
01:42:31,958 --> 01:42:32,708
This...

1654
01:42:33,083 --> 01:42:35,292
It's the chain your brother-in-law
needs to put on for you.

1655
01:42:40,792 --> 01:42:43,625
For the both of you,
using her small savings

1656
01:42:43,958 --> 01:42:45,500
Mom had bought this.

1657
01:42:48,792 --> 01:42:50,833
You both need to exchange it.

1658
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:52,917
That's my mom's last wish.

1659
01:43:30,917 --> 01:43:31,417
Thank you.

1660
01:43:40,458 --> 01:43:40,958
Ma'am.

1661
01:44:07,833 --> 01:44:08,833
Madhan!

1662
01:44:46,875 --> 01:44:47,875
Meow!

1663
01:44:49,792 --> 01:44:50,792
Meow!

1664
01:44:53,042 --> 01:44:54,042
Meow!

1665
01:44:54,708 --> 01:44:55,500
Meow!

1666
01:44:56,125 --> 01:44:58,167
Are you guys hungry? Meow!

1667
01:46:01,208 --> 01:46:02,042
Break-in!

1668
01:46:37,083 --> 01:46:38,083
Let me go, sir!

1669
01:46:38,875 --> 01:46:40,167
- Where is the stash?
- Let me go!

1670
01:46:40,292 --> 01:46:41,667
- Tell me!
- I don't know.

1671
01:46:41,708 --> 01:46:43,125
- Tell me everything!
- I don't know anything.

1672
01:46:43,250 --> 01:46:44,292
- I don't know anything.
- Ma'am!

1673
01:46:55,583 --> 01:46:56,500
Look ma'am.

1674
01:46:57,042 --> 01:46:58,375
It's in these ghutka raw materials

1675
01:46:58,417 --> 01:47:00,667
that they're mixing drugs and peddling it.

1676
01:47:01,083 --> 01:47:02,208
It's atrocius!

1677
01:47:02,250 --> 01:47:03,250
Not just this.

1678
01:47:03,292 --> 01:47:06,875
They're mixing cancer causing
chemicals in this Pan Masala.

1679
01:47:07,208 --> 01:47:07,792
Rascals!

1680
01:47:07,833 --> 01:47:10,000
This is a completely banned
business in Tamil Nadu.

1681
01:47:10,292 --> 01:47:12,958
But every day stash worth millions
gets distributed all over the State.

1682
01:47:13,083 --> 01:47:16,375
School-going teens and daily
labourers become addicted to this.

1683
01:47:16,417 --> 01:47:17,417
Enquire him.

1684
01:47:17,500 --> 01:47:18,458
Where are the others?

1685
01:47:20,750 --> 01:47:21,583
He won't speak.

1686
01:47:21,792 --> 01:47:22,792
We'll make him talk later. Let's go.

1687
01:47:25,292 --> 01:47:25,958
Ma'am!

1688
01:47:29,833 --> 01:47:30,458
Yesterday

1689
01:47:30,708 --> 01:47:32,667
In the Madhavaram-Sengundram
area near Chennai

1690
01:47:32,708 --> 01:47:39,583
Illegal drugs worth millions were found in
Madhusudhan's property and has been sealed.

1691
01:47:43,458 --> 01:47:44,667
Hey! That's our bike!

1692
01:47:44,792 --> 01:47:46,500
- That's our bike!
- Freeze the frame, sir.

1693
01:47:46,833 --> 01:47:48,542
Zoom in to the registration plate.

1694
01:47:48,792 --> 01:47:52,583
- 1960, it's our vehicle!
- Zoom in towards that red helmet guy.

1695
01:47:52,583 --> 01:47:53,583
- Yes.
- That guy. Yes.

1696
01:47:53,792 --> 01:47:55,417
- Nosy?
- Yes, it's him!

1697
01:47:55,500 --> 01:47:59,083
- He's got a tattoo. Look!
- Yes! - They're caught!

1698
01:47:59,208 --> 01:47:59,917
Yes!

1699
01:47:59,917 --> 01:48:01,833
- Copy this to my phone. - Okay.
- It's definitely him!

1700
01:48:01,875 --> 01:48:02,625
This is enough!

1701
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:06,083
I need to produce it at the station
and get out of that damn house!

1702
01:48:06,125 --> 01:48:08,417
- But Madhan, the thing is...
- Hey

1703
01:48:08,917 --> 01:48:11,125
Let's show it to the Inspector
through your brother-in-law.

1704
01:48:12,458 --> 01:48:14,208
- Don't talk about him!
- Hey, Madhan!

1705
01:48:14,458 --> 01:48:16,917
- Why do you keep bringing things up?
- You step aside!

1706
01:48:17,500 --> 01:48:19,333
Go on then. Go give it.

1707
01:48:19,833 --> 01:48:22,500
You'll tell them that the guy without
three fingers is the culprit.

1708
01:48:22,542 --> 01:48:23,792
But the Inspector...

1709
01:48:23,958 --> 01:48:26,417
He'll say that you're the
one who was driving.

1710
01:48:28,750 --> 01:48:31,708
Take a look. Your brother-in-law
has deleted it from YouTube.

1711
01:48:32,125 --> 01:48:34,458
Only the person who uploads it
can delete it. You know, right?

1712
01:48:35,083 --> 01:48:36,083
So what?

1713
01:48:36,250 --> 01:48:39,000
He threw a nightie at me the
other day to insult me.

1714
01:48:39,792 --> 01:48:41,042
Get this drilled into your heads.

1715
01:48:41,333 --> 01:48:42,375
Only for you guys

1716
01:48:42,833 --> 01:48:45,000
I've been sitting in his
house like it's the loo.

1717
01:48:47,542 --> 01:48:48,167
Hey

1718
01:48:49,417 --> 01:48:51,333
I'll talk to your sister.

1719
01:48:52,042 --> 01:48:53,375
He's my enemy.

1720
01:48:53,417 --> 01:48:54,333
But she's a backstabber.

1721
01:48:54,917 --> 01:48:56,542
Finding those culprits

1722
01:48:57,167 --> 01:48:57,958
is my job.

1723
01:49:01,500 --> 01:49:03,083
Minister, shut up!

1724
01:49:03,458 --> 01:49:05,208
You've proven to be a politician.

1725
01:49:05,417 --> 01:49:07,292
You'll come to me with open
arms during Elections, right?

1726
01:49:07,833 --> 01:49:10,583
- I'll deal with you then.
- It's Saturday today, the Court...

1727
01:49:20,375 --> 01:49:22,292
To arrest a prominent person like me

1728
01:49:22,625 --> 01:49:24,000
you'll definitely have a warrant.

1729
01:49:44,333 --> 01:49:46,792
The complaint raised by
Traffic SI Rajasekar

1730
01:49:46,833 --> 01:49:49,083
has led to the shutting
down of your factories.

1731
01:49:49,125 --> 01:49:52,833
He's been deputed on the Home
Secretary's special permission.

1732
01:50:00,625 --> 01:50:03,792
You can't even imprison
the dog in my house.

1733
01:50:11,083 --> 01:50:13,333
You think you've won?

1734
01:50:14,333 --> 01:50:15,750
I'll tell you even now.

1735
01:50:16,542 --> 01:50:19,000
You can't put me in jail even for a day.

1736
01:50:20,375 --> 01:50:21,083
Hey

1737
01:50:22,583 --> 01:50:24,167
When it comes to a challenge

1738
01:50:25,417 --> 01:50:27,042
I'll go to any extreme!

1739
01:50:51,042 --> 01:50:52,875
We've crossed Red Hills and are on our way.

1740
01:50:58,708 --> 01:51:00,500
Hey! What are you doing?

1741
01:51:01,250 --> 01:51:02,000
Stop!

1742
01:51:05,875 --> 01:51:08,292
Puzhal Jail is 23kms away from here.

1743
01:51:08,708 --> 01:51:11,083
I can even be in a hospital for 6 months.

1744
01:51:11,542 --> 01:51:13,625
But never in jail for even a day.

1745
01:51:14,375 --> 01:51:15,917
Crash my vehicle.

1746
01:51:31,708 --> 01:51:33,167
Hey, who are you people?

1747
01:51:33,292 --> 01:51:34,917
There's someone staying at your house.

1748
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:36,375
Ask him, he'll tell you.

1749
01:51:37,083 --> 01:51:40,875
If you win a traffic race, it's awesome!

1750
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:44,292
If you're caught by the
cops, it's troublesome!

1751
01:51:44,333 --> 01:51:47,542
If you race in Chennai, it's awesome!

1752
01:51:47,625 --> 01:51:49,083
Are you senseless?

1753
01:51:49,208 --> 01:51:51,333
I told you I got caught in
a case and can't race you.

1754
01:51:51,458 --> 01:51:53,208
Why did you beat him up?
Answer him now.

1755
01:51:54,833 --> 01:51:55,875
- Damn you!
- Hey!

1756
01:51:56,167 --> 01:51:58,750
- Hey! Hold it!
- Wait, listen for a minute!

1757
01:51:58,792 --> 01:52:00,958
Look, you're causing
unnecessary trouble.

1758
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,458
Just because you're a cop you
can't take him so easily.

1759
01:52:03,458 --> 01:52:04,625
Try taking him.

1760
01:52:05,083 --> 01:52:06,542
You can't behave as you wish.

1761
01:52:06,583 --> 01:52:08,458
- Hey!
- Who are you?

1762
01:52:08,500 --> 01:52:10,458
It's you isn't it?

1763
01:52:11,667 --> 01:52:13,083
What is your problem?

1764
01:52:13,083 --> 01:52:14,167
You're the one who stole my bike, right?

1765
01:52:14,167 --> 01:52:15,875
- You're the chain snatcher, right?
- What chain?

1766
01:52:15,917 --> 01:52:17,792
You took our bike and stole the chain!

1767
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:19,917
Everything is recorded on my phone!

1768
01:52:19,958 --> 01:52:22,042
There's proof of these
fingers and the tattoo.

1769
01:52:22,042 --> 01:52:23,625
If you have proof you'll take him?

1770
01:52:23,667 --> 01:52:25,250
Hey, call boss!

1771
01:52:31,708 --> 01:52:34,208
- Snatching chains you thief!
- Don't hit me boss!

1772
01:52:34,583 --> 01:52:35,208
Come.

1773
01:52:35,417 --> 01:52:37,792
- Instead of racing you've become a thief!
- Sorry boss, don't hit me!

1774
01:52:37,833 --> 01:52:38,542
Ask him.

1775
01:52:39,208 --> 01:52:40,000
Sir

1776
01:52:40,042 --> 01:52:42,250
I wanted him to race that's
why I hit your brother.

1777
01:52:42,292 --> 01:52:43,000
Sorry, sir.

1778
01:52:43,667 --> 01:52:44,500
Sorry bro.

1779
01:52:44,917 --> 01:52:45,917
And, Rajasekar...

1780
01:52:46,042 --> 01:52:46,875
The culprit...

1781
01:52:47,417 --> 01:52:49,042
The Counsellor has agreed
to send him.

1782
01:52:49,458 --> 01:52:50,958
- There's no issue.
- Thank you, sir.

1783
01:52:51,292 --> 01:52:52,000
It's okay.

1784
01:52:52,333 --> 01:52:56,833
But they say only if your brother-in-law
wins the race the culprit will surrender.

1785
01:52:57,375 --> 01:52:58,208
What do you say?

1786
01:52:59,208 --> 01:53:00,708
Sir, you have the culprit
and there's evidence.

1787
01:53:01,375 --> 01:53:02,375
Arrest him.

1788
01:53:02,417 --> 01:53:03,417
Do your duty.

1789
01:53:03,792 --> 01:53:05,125
Speak like a Crime Inspector.

1790
01:53:05,875 --> 01:53:06,667
Rajasekar

1791
01:53:06,875 --> 01:53:11,083
I was a Crime Inspector when I sent your
brother-in-law home without remanding him.

1792
01:53:11,917 --> 01:53:14,833
You cannot outweigh the
local power in some areas.

1793
01:53:14,875 --> 01:53:16,000
He won't race.

1794
01:53:16,167 --> 01:53:16,958
I won't let him.

1795
01:53:17,125 --> 01:53:18,542
The person who has to race is silent.

1796
01:53:18,792 --> 01:53:19,875
Who the hell are you?

1797
01:53:20,250 --> 01:53:21,250
I'm his brother-in-law.

1798
01:53:21,458 --> 01:53:23,375
I don't have a damn
brother-in-law or anyone else.

1799
01:53:23,833 --> 01:53:25,250
No one has to speak in my place.

1800
01:53:25,500 --> 01:53:26,500
I'll race.

1801
01:53:27,208 --> 01:53:27,792
Hey

1802
01:53:28,292 --> 01:53:29,917
If we stay here any longer,
it'll be an insult.

1803
01:53:30,208 --> 01:53:31,292
He's insulting you!

1804
01:53:31,458 --> 01:53:32,167
Let's leave.

1805
01:53:32,750 --> 01:53:33,750
Brother, wait.

1806
01:53:34,167 --> 01:53:35,167
Are you coming or not?

1807
01:53:35,875 --> 01:53:36,375
Brother

1808
01:53:36,958 --> 01:53:37,958
What are you saying?

1809
01:53:38,500 --> 01:53:39,500
He's a young boy.

1810
01:53:40,208 --> 01:53:41,083
His age is like that.

1811
01:53:41,250 --> 01:53:42,083
Like our Prabhu.

1812
01:53:42,792 --> 01:53:43,875
Will we abandon him?

1813
01:53:43,958 --> 01:53:45,250
There's a limit to every relationship.

1814
01:53:46,083 --> 01:53:47,083
Prabhu is our brother.

1815
01:53:47,417 --> 01:53:48,417
Is he your brother?

1816
01:53:48,917 --> 01:53:49,542
Or friend?

1817
01:53:49,583 --> 01:53:50,792
Or is he your son?

1818
01:53:51,125 --> 01:53:51,958
All three isn't it?

1819
01:53:52,833 --> 01:53:53,458
Brother-in-law.

1820
01:53:56,667 --> 01:53:58,042
I cannot give up on him.

1821
01:53:59,083 --> 01:54:00,500
Do whatever you want.
I'll be in the car.

1822
01:54:00,625 --> 01:54:01,333
- Brother
- Come...

1823
01:54:01,625 --> 01:54:02,208
Go away!

1824
01:54:04,250 --> 01:54:04,708
Hey

1825
01:54:05,958 --> 01:54:07,792
You don't have to race fearing the case.

1826
01:54:08,208 --> 01:54:09,042
I'll take care of it.

1827
01:54:09,208 --> 01:54:10,250
You don't have to give me advice.

1828
01:54:10,833 --> 01:54:11,833
I'll sign the document, sir.

1829
01:54:12,375 --> 01:54:13,708
Can I go home if I sign it?

1830
01:54:14,875 --> 01:54:15,875
I'm telling you not to do it!

1831
01:54:16,333 --> 01:54:17,250
You're acting all big?

1832
01:54:17,917 --> 01:54:18,875
What's going on, sir?

1833
01:54:19,208 --> 01:54:20,500
Is this how you deal with the case?

1834
01:54:27,292 --> 01:54:29,083
You're young, but you
can't have everything!

1835
01:54:29,333 --> 01:54:30,792
Who is young?

1836
01:54:30,875 --> 01:54:31,875
Who is the young boy?

1837
01:54:32,500 --> 01:54:33,500
What are you even thinking?

1838
01:54:33,542 --> 01:54:34,625
You think no one can question...

1839
01:54:34,833 --> 01:54:35,458
Hey!

1840
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:54,708
Let go!

1841
01:55:02,083 --> 01:55:04,125
You're trying to get me fired?

1842
01:55:04,333 --> 01:55:05,167
My job!

1843
01:55:06,292 --> 01:55:07,500
Get in!

1844
01:55:10,375 --> 01:55:12,375
You might get me imprisoned!

1845
01:55:14,875 --> 01:55:15,958
Let go! What do you want?

1846
01:56:35,875 --> 01:56:37,458
Is the pain intolerable?

1847
01:56:39,042 --> 01:56:40,042
Please bear with it.

1848
01:56:52,333 --> 01:56:54,208
Prabhu, get a cloth from the car quickly.

1849
01:56:54,708 --> 01:56:56,208
Get up slowly.

1850
01:57:05,250 --> 01:57:06,083
Hey!

1851
01:57:06,417 --> 01:57:08,250
Your uncle has intervened the race.

1852
01:57:08,250 --> 01:57:09,667
We have already won.

1853
01:57:09,708 --> 01:57:12,667
Sir, this time around adorn him in a
gorgeous saree isntead of a nightie.

1854
01:57:12,792 --> 01:57:14,708
You're not getting out
of that case anymore.

1855
01:57:14,750 --> 01:57:17,542
Sir, drop him off at the Puzhal
Prison while you're at it.

1856
01:57:17,542 --> 01:57:19,167
Prabhu, take him to the hospital.

1857
01:57:20,042 --> 01:57:20,625
Hold him.

1858
01:57:26,750 --> 01:57:27,417
Get up.

1859
01:57:29,042 --> 01:57:30,542
We're no longer related.

1860
01:57:31,417 --> 01:57:32,417
That's over.

1861
01:57:34,083 --> 01:57:35,083
I'm telling you again.

1862
01:57:35,625 --> 01:57:37,042
Racing is a mistake.

1863
01:57:37,917 --> 01:57:39,875
But you have to win this race for sure.

1864
01:57:40,958 --> 01:57:45,667
For the friends who are waiting at the
finish line hoping to get out of this case

1865
01:57:46,292 --> 01:57:50,917
and for those who think they can cheat and
win, your victory will serve justice.

1866
01:58:13,375 --> 01:58:14,792
Move it bro!

1867
01:58:43,542 --> 01:58:46,458
He's coming! He's here!

1868
01:58:59,042 --> 01:59:00,042
Sir!

1869
01:59:01,250 --> 01:59:02,250
Sir!

1870
01:59:03,958 --> 01:59:06,208
Does it hurt? It would have
been the same for him!

1871
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:27,458
Shit!

1872
01:59:34,125 --> 01:59:34,875
Hands off!

1873
01:59:37,292 --> 01:59:38,292
This is your race!

1874
01:59:39,292 --> 01:59:40,292
You have to ride.

1875
01:59:46,333 --> 01:59:47,625
Hey, it's his brother-in-law!

1876
01:59:47,625 --> 01:59:49,167
Yes! He won it!

1877
01:59:51,792 --> 01:59:53,042
Hey! Who is that now?

1878
01:59:56,958 --> 01:59:57,583
Madhan!

1879
01:59:58,292 --> 01:59:59,167
Madhan!

1880
02:00:56,375 --> 02:00:57,917
You, lift him up!

1881
02:01:05,958 --> 02:01:06,625
Hey!

1882
02:01:07,500 --> 02:01:08,917
You challenged me.

1883
02:01:09,500 --> 02:01:10,292
Did you win?

1884
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:13,000
Did you beat me?

1885
02:01:14,583 --> 02:01:15,333
One day.

1886
02:01:15,542 --> 02:01:17,375
Could you put me in jail for just a day?

1887
02:01:17,708 --> 02:01:18,333
Tell me.

1888
02:01:19,167 --> 02:01:19,875
Hey

1889
02:01:20,375 --> 02:01:22,583
The people who challenge me

1890
02:01:22,875 --> 02:01:26,333
have never lived on their terms nor
have they died on their terms.

1891
02:01:32,625 --> 02:01:33,500
Who is that?

1892
02:01:35,208 --> 02:01:36,083
Tell me!

1893
02:01:36,458 --> 02:01:38,250
Both of them were in the bike together.

1894
02:01:38,542 --> 02:01:41,792
Our men targeted the cop, but
brought him along as well.

1895
02:01:45,417 --> 02:01:46,000
Hey

1896
02:01:47,083 --> 02:01:47,917
Who is he?

1897
02:01:48,583 --> 02:01:49,583
Why was he with you?

1898
02:01:53,083 --> 02:01:54,417
Hey, who are you?

1899
02:01:55,208 --> 02:01:56,208
I'm talking to you!

1900
02:01:57,417 --> 02:01:59,208
How do you know him? Tell me!

1901
02:02:02,417 --> 02:02:04,292
- He's talking to you!
- Stop it!

1902
02:02:06,667 --> 02:02:07,625
I'm his uncle.

1903
02:02:07,667 --> 02:02:09,208
A brother-in-law means all three, right?

1904
02:02:10,583 --> 02:02:11,833
We're not brothers-in-law are we?

1905
02:02:14,083 --> 02:02:15,542
Tell him you gave me a lift!

1906
02:02:25,792 --> 02:02:27,125
He gave you a lift?

1907
02:02:29,500 --> 02:02:31,375
The place he's going now...

1908
02:02:31,417 --> 02:02:32,000
Son

1909
02:02:33,125 --> 02:02:35,708
This cop will you give
will give you a lift.

1910
02:02:56,167 --> 02:02:57,000
Run!

1911
02:03:28,250 --> 02:03:29,250
Catch him!

1912
02:03:32,333 --> 02:03:34,625
If I catch you, I'll kill you!

1913
02:04:10,792 --> 02:04:11,292
Catch it!

1914
02:04:51,083 --> 02:04:52,083
There you are!

1915
02:04:53,750 --> 02:04:54,750
Call him!

1916
02:05:48,375 --> 02:05:49,083
Get going!

1917
02:06:35,458 --> 02:06:36,583
That way!

1918
02:06:44,458 --> 02:06:45,000
Leave.

1919
02:06:46,792 --> 02:06:48,583
At least you can escape from here.

1920
02:06:51,167 --> 02:06:52,167
I said go!

1921
02:06:52,708 --> 02:06:53,875
If you stay

1922
02:06:53,917 --> 02:06:55,667
they will kill you as well.

1923
02:07:04,250 --> 02:07:04,917
Shit!

1924
02:07:19,833 --> 02:07:21,583
Please don't hate your sister!

1925
02:07:27,292 --> 02:07:29,250
You're always in her mind.

1926
02:07:32,042 --> 02:07:33,042
You're her everything!

1927
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:42,208
My Raji!

1928
02:07:44,250 --> 02:07:45,667
It's from her shawl.

1929
02:07:45,667 --> 02:07:47,792
My Raji...Raji...

1930
02:07:48,792 --> 02:07:50,083
I left her at the hosptial...

1931
02:07:50,750 --> 02:07:51,375
Raji...

1932
02:07:52,167 --> 02:07:53,000
What?

1933
02:07:53,208 --> 02:07:54,000
Hospital?

1934
02:07:57,833 --> 02:07:58,292
Why?

1935
02:07:59,667 --> 02:08:00,667
My phone!

1936
02:08:01,333 --> 02:08:02,500
Phone...

1937
02:08:03,167 --> 02:08:04,625
Socks...it's in my socks!

1938
02:08:11,708 --> 02:08:12,375
Control Room?

1939
02:08:30,875 --> 02:08:31,875
Raj...

1940
02:08:33,167 --> 02:08:34,542
It's our baby, Raj!

1941
02:08:35,750 --> 02:08:38,042
The nurse just gave her to me.

1942
02:08:57,375 --> 02:09:01,542
She's crying with eagerness
to see her father!

1943
02:09:05,583 --> 02:09:06,583
Raj!

1944
02:09:07,333 --> 02:09:09,750
This moment, as I'm holding our baby...

1945
02:09:10,875 --> 02:09:12,583
the day my brother was born...

1946
02:09:13,417 --> 02:09:14,750
I held him...

1947
02:09:14,958 --> 02:09:16,375
and placed him on my lap...

1948
02:09:16,417 --> 02:09:19,708
and threw a tantrum, not
letting anyone take him...

1949
02:09:20,333 --> 02:09:21,792
is what this moment reminds me!

1950
02:09:24,583 --> 02:09:25,958
Raj, please!

1951
02:09:27,250 --> 02:09:29,458
Is it possible

1952
02:09:31,042 --> 02:09:34,042
to somehow tell him that I've
become a mother of a child?

1953
02:09:36,417 --> 02:09:37,417
If he knows

1954
02:09:38,500 --> 02:09:40,667
he'll forget everything

1955
02:09:40,958 --> 02:09:43,167
and come visit me, won't he?

1956
02:09:45,458 --> 02:09:46,083
He'll...

1957
02:09:47,375 --> 02:09:50,625
He'll call me 'Kitty', won't he?

1958
02:10:05,625 --> 02:10:08,333
Kitty is my mom and I'm her dad!

1959
02:10:34,500 --> 02:10:37,208
Kitty will always be my mother!

1960
02:10:39,875 --> 02:10:40,750
It was me!

1961
02:10:40,958 --> 02:10:42,500
I made a mistake!

1962
02:10:43,667 --> 02:10:46,333
- I'll only marry if I like someone.
- You don't know anything!

1963
02:10:47,375 --> 02:10:48,625
I'm the one who'll find the groom!

1964
02:10:49,208 --> 02:10:50,458
I need to like him as well!

1965
02:10:52,500 --> 02:10:55,417
I can't stand the sight of him!

1966
02:10:59,333 --> 02:11:00,833
Who asked you to come here?

1967
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:03,042
Go with him already!

1968
02:11:06,333 --> 02:11:09,000
It was me...trying to be her dad...

1969
02:11:11,083 --> 02:11:13,875
I never understood my Kitty!

1970
02:11:16,625 --> 02:11:17,917
Poor thing, my Kitty!

1971
02:11:23,083 --> 02:11:24,667
Not just you.

1972
02:11:25,083 --> 02:11:27,125
All of us...

1973
02:11:27,917 --> 02:11:30,667
are controlling our women
in the name of love.

1974
02:11:32,917 --> 02:11:33,792
I feel sad...

1975
02:11:33,917 --> 02:11:35,208
for our Kitty...

1976
02:11:35,417 --> 02:11:36,500
Forgive me, Kitty!

1977
02:11:37,292 --> 02:11:39,125
Please forgive me, Kitty!

1978
02:11:43,167 --> 02:11:45,000
Will you go visit your sister?

1979
02:11:47,333 --> 02:11:49,000
Please take care of my Raji, okay?

1980
02:11:50,750 --> 02:11:51,750
You will, right?

1981
02:11:53,667 --> 02:11:54,667
Raji...

1982
02:11:56,250 --> 02:11:57,083
Raji...

1983
02:12:16,292 --> 02:12:17,000
You!

1984
02:12:18,167 --> 02:12:19,167
I'm right here!

1985
02:12:54,125 --> 02:12:54,667
You!

1986
02:12:54,833 --> 02:12:56,875
Why are fighting for
someone you gave lift to?

1987
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:00,708
Tell me! Tell me I say!

1988
02:13:01,917 --> 02:13:03,375
Who gave a lift?

1989
02:13:04,458 --> 02:13:05,708
He's my brother-in-law!

1990
02:13:07,333 --> 02:13:09,292
I'm his brother-in-law!

1991
02:13:10,083 --> 02:13:11,333
He's my brother-in-law!

1992
02:13:13,542 --> 02:13:15,542
You must not die so easily!

1993
02:13:16,167 --> 02:13:17,833
At least one day

1994
02:13:17,958 --> 02:13:18,958
you must be in jail!

1995
02:13:19,500 --> 02:13:21,708
If my brother-in-law has
to win the challenge

1996
02:13:22,708 --> 02:13:24,625
you must be in jail at least for a day!

1997
02:17:09,375 --> 02:17:10,083
Brother-in-law...

1998
02:17:10,250 --> 02:17:13,875
Wearing a helmet and riding feels like
Kavin riding with a chair on hear head.

1999
02:17:13,917 --> 02:17:14,708
Madhan!

2000
02:17:15,958 --> 02:17:16,958
How are you doing?

2001
02:17:17,750 --> 02:17:19,333
I won an important race!

2002
02:17:20,167 --> 02:17:20,792
But

2003
02:17:21,125 --> 02:17:22,458
now my life is miserable...

2004
02:17:30,750 --> 02:17:31,292
Damn!

2005
02:17:38,417 --> 02:17:40,000
It's nothing sweetheart!

2006
02:17:40,042 --> 02:17:42,417
It's almost done, my cutiepie!

2007
02:17:42,458 --> 02:17:43,625
Damn it, uncle!

2008
02:17:43,958 --> 02:17:46,500
You messsed it up! You could
have played this card!

2009
02:17:48,417 --> 02:17:49,167
Sister...

2010
02:17:49,542 --> 02:17:51,292
Look at the brothers-in-law
coming together!

2011
02:17:56,125 --> 02:17:57,250
- Here.
- I'll call you back.

2012
02:17:57,292 --> 02:17:59,042
- Not there, here.
- Take a look at that.

2013
02:18:04,125 --> 02:18:06,333
Wait, Raji. What is it baby?
Dad will be right back.

2014
02:18:11,917 --> 02:18:13,875
How many girlfriends do you have?

2015
02:18:14,042 --> 02:18:15,708
- Just one!
- Really?

2016
02:18:15,708 --> 02:18:16,583
Brother-in-law!

2017
02:18:16,958 --> 02:18:18,208
- Yes?
- What does your brother-in-law say?

2018
02:18:18,667 --> 02:18:20,333
He has only one girlfriend apparently.

2019
02:18:20,375 --> 02:18:21,917
- He's upset.
- Really?

2020
02:18:22,167 --> 02:18:22,792
Really?

2021
02:18:23,083 --> 02:18:24,083
Yes, brother-in-law.

2022
02:18:25,417 --> 02:18:26,875
He broke up with the other one!

2023
02:18:26,875 --> 02:18:27,417
Hey!

2024
02:18:27,833 --> 02:18:28,625
Yes...

2025
02:20:43,583 --> 02:20:43,958
