25
00:02:48,882 --> 00:02:52,374
Look in the eye and speak.

00:02:52,486 --> 00:02:55,717
Malti, forget it. l feel
he is a fool. - The same.

27
00:02:55,889 --> 00:02:59,950
Hey, listen. Madam. l am not a fool.

28
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:05,423
Friends, l have not
come to give a lecture.

29
00:03:05,699 --> 00:03:09,635
l say whatever l want to say
with the power of writing.

30
00:03:09,736 --> 00:03:12,102
lf you want to ask me something.

31
00:03:12,472 --> 00:03:17,637
On my novels. My stories.
Then you can surely ask.

32
00:03:18,445 --> 00:03:21,573
Devendra, in the beginning
you used to write songs.

33
00:03:22,582 --> 00:03:27,212
Why have you left it now?
- l haven't left writing songs.

34
00:03:27,621 --> 00:03:29,213
l have surely made it less.

35
00:03:29,456 --> 00:03:32,391
Today the demand
for stories are more.

36
00:03:32,826 --> 00:03:34,794
Devendra, it is right
that many editions of..

37
00:03:34,895 --> 00:03:38,456
..your novels are out. Then
too a writer, can he live..

38
00:03:38,698 --> 00:03:40,791
..with so much riches with
the earnings from his writing?

39
00:03:40,901 --> 00:03:45,565
The way you do. - l think you
are talking about my bungalow.

40
00:03:46,773 --> 00:03:49,765
Toilet. - That was
earned by my fore fathers.

41
00:03:50,143 --> 00:03:52,839
My family was the family of lawyers.

42
00:03:52,946 --> 00:03:55,141
That is why l had to study law.

43
00:03:55,482 --> 00:04:00,647
By being a writer l
broke the law of my family.

44
00:04:02,722 --> 00:04:06,681
Zilmil, ek Kahani and
Pyari Muskan leaving aside..

45
00:04:06,793 --> 00:04:09,193
..these two novels. The
heroine of the other novels.

46
00:04:09,396 --> 00:04:11,330
Why are they cheaters?

47
00:04:11,631 --> 00:04:13,599
Have you seen only
this side of a woman?

48
00:04:14,167 --> 00:04:16,328
The way l have presented a woman..

49
00:04:16,703 --> 00:04:18,830
..l feel that is her true self.

50
00:04:19,372 --> 00:04:21,237
Are you a woman hater?

51
00:04:25,812 --> 00:04:26,836
No comments.

52
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,612
Uncle. Uncle. Toilet.

53
00:04:32,252 --> 00:04:37,121
l feel that some girl has
cheated you badly in love.

54
00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:41,454
Tell us the name of that girl?

55
00:04:42,295 --> 00:04:46,322
Look. l have come here
to speak about my writing.

56
00:04:46,433 --> 00:04:50,631
Not about myself. Kindly limit
your questions to that topic.

57
00:04:51,471 --> 00:04:53,666
Which new novel are you printing?

58
00:04:54,774 --> 00:04:59,302
lt's being printed. The
name is Anamika(No name).

59
00:07:11,244 --> 00:07:13,644
Hey, someone fell off that car.

60
00:07:29,896 --> 00:07:31,659
They left her here.

61
00:07:35,502 --> 00:07:36,594
Uncle, wait.

62
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,863
Don't touch her.

63
00:07:38,438 --> 00:07:39,837
l feel they are goons.

64
00:07:40,774 --> 00:07:42,674
Wait here. l will call the police.

65
00:07:43,109 --> 00:07:46,237
Come Hanuman.
- Wait. Wait. Her hands are tied.

66
00:07:46,846 --> 00:07:48,780
Blood is flowing from her head.

67
00:07:49,682 --> 00:07:51,650
l feel something is wrong.

68
00:07:51,751 --> 00:07:53,912
That is why l am saying
let's inform the police.

69
00:07:54,687 --> 00:07:57,713
So much hatred for woman.
That a human forgets humanity.

70
00:07:57,824 --> 00:07:59,758
Come, let's help. Come.
Our house is close by.

71
00:07:59,859 --> 00:08:00,848
Let's take her home.

72
00:08:02,328 --> 00:08:03,693
C'mon. Come.

73
00:08:11,337 --> 00:08:15,273
Can l come in now?
- l told you to come. Come.

74
00:08:22,482 --> 00:08:26,316
ls she very hurt?
- No. Rest is scratches.

75
00:08:26,419 --> 00:08:28,683
She has got hurt on her forehead.
Nothing much.

76
00:08:29,455 --> 00:08:31,446
How did she fall unconscious?

77
00:08:31,758 --> 00:08:35,353
Either she is in shock or scared?

78
00:08:35,528 --> 00:08:38,258
l have injected her.
lf you don't mind.

79
00:08:38,464 --> 00:08:40,125
She will be fine by morning.

80
00:08:56,449 --> 00:09:01,546
You? Why did you get tea?
Wasn't Ram Lakhan there?

81
00:09:01,788 --> 00:09:03,312
Everyone is at home.

82
00:09:04,123 --> 00:09:07,320
But l felt like having tea with you.

83
00:09:08,428 --> 00:09:09,759
That is why l brought tea.

84
00:09:10,697 --> 00:09:13,131
Go and freshen up, l
will prepare tea for you.

85
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:20,704
Listen; don't you remember
what happened last night?

86
00:09:21,808 --> 00:09:23,366
Forget about the night.

87
00:09:23,476 --> 00:09:24,374
The night has gone
and everything with it.

88
00:09:24,477 --> 00:09:27,241
l did what you said last night.
Take, have tea.

89
00:09:27,647 --> 00:09:30,878
Look, l feel you
understood differently.

90
00:09:32,352 --> 00:09:35,287
You always say that
l misunderstand you.

91
00:09:35,755 --> 00:09:37,484
You can understand me well.

92
00:09:38,091 --> 00:09:40,616
lf l say something you
will say l speak a lot.

93
00:09:42,128 --> 00:09:46,531
lf you could give time for
your wife from writing. - Wife?

94
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,258
What are you saying?
Whose wife? What wife?

95
00:09:52,906 --> 00:09:54,737
Am l not your wife now?

96
00:09:56,142 --> 00:09:58,110
Have you gone insane?

97
00:09:58,278 --> 00:09:59,506
Don't you remember anything?

98
00:09:59,712 --> 00:10:01,873
Last night someone pushed
you out of a running car?

99
00:10:02,215 --> 00:10:04,809
You were unconscious. We got
you here on uncle's insistence.

100
00:10:04,918 --> 00:10:07,546
Called the doctor.
Don't you see this bandage?

101
00:10:08,788 --> 00:10:11,484
lt's your habit to make
a mountain out of a mole.

102
00:10:11,824 --> 00:10:13,382
Sometime you say
that l fell in a river.

103
00:10:13,493 --> 00:10:15,154
Sometime you say l jump into a fire.

104
00:10:15,461 --> 00:10:16,758
l fell from the staircase.

105
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:19,421
You say someone pushed
me out of a running car.

106
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:24,236
These things seem good for novels.
Not for your wife.

107
00:10:25,571 --> 00:10:29,837
Uncle, did you hear? l
don't even know her name.

108
00:10:29,943 --> 00:10:32,275
She calls herself my wife.

109
00:10:34,814 --> 00:10:36,304
God bless.
- Uncle.

110
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:41,718
Uncle. You judge us. Don't
a husband and wife fight?

111
00:10:41,821 --> 00:10:44,415
They do fight. But..
- So, the husband refuses..

112
00:10:44,524 --> 00:10:47,459
..to accept her as a wife?
- No dear. But..

113
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,427
Come with me.

114
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,964
l don't know when he
will stop fighting.

115
00:11:10,516 --> 00:11:12,143
Good morning sweet doll.

116
00:11:12,251 --> 00:11:15,778
How do you know
that my name is Dolly?

117
00:11:16,255 --> 00:11:18,314
l am your aunt,
won't l know your name.

118
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:21,889
Will you have tea?
- Kids don't drink tea.

119
00:11:22,161 --> 00:11:23,685
l will look dark.

120
00:11:25,264 --> 00:11:27,664
l told you last night
hand her over to the police.

121
00:11:27,767 --> 00:11:29,758
l thought once she
comes to consciousness..

122
00:11:29,869 --> 00:11:31,894
..we will ask her and
sent her to her home.

123
00:11:32,171 --> 00:11:35,163
She is a girl. Once she
goes to the police station.

124
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:36,842
She will be blamed
and her family too.

125
00:11:36,943 --> 00:11:41,380
You saw it. We helped her.
She is not leaving us now.

126
00:11:41,748 --> 00:11:43,181
Definitely she is
playing some trick.

127
00:11:43,282 --> 00:11:45,716
Alright. l will call up Rishad

128
00:11:45,818 --> 00:11:49,413
l will go to the police
station too. - Do that.

129
00:11:49,589 --> 00:11:52,183
Please solve this problem quickly.

130
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,528
Here. Within moments
she influenced Dolly too.

131
00:12:04,203 --> 00:12:06,364
l feel she is a magician.

132
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:19,909
Dear, Rishad has left from home.

133
00:12:20,186 --> 00:12:21,483
l spoke to the inspector too.

134
00:12:21,587 --> 00:12:23,612
They will be coming

Why do you worry?
The doctor is coming.

As well as the inspector.
They will do what is right.

Take, wear your clothes.

That is why you have
turned your face. - What else?

143

You are standing in a
stranger's room without clothes.

00:15:22,602 --> 00:15:25,230
Didn't you come for my wedding?
- No.

174
00:15:26,472 --> 00:15:29,305
How could l come?
Devendra is not married yet.

175
00:15:29,775 --> 00:15:30,901
Lie.

176
00:15:31,811 --> 00:15:34,905
l am married to him. l am his wife.

177
00:15:36,148 --> 00:15:39,606
No dear. You have forgotten.
Try to remember.

178
00:15:40,453 --> 00:15:42,819
Alright. l don't remember anything.

179
00:15:43,356 --> 00:15:45,256
But l know very well that..

180
00:15:45,725 --> 00:15:47,420
..l am the daughter
in law of this family.

181
00:15:48,728 --> 00:15:50,491
l am married to him.

182
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:55,364
Doctor, l am speaking the truth.

183
00:15:56,135 --> 00:16:00,162
l remember very well
that l am married to him.

184
00:16:03,609 --> 00:16:06,407
Hello inspector. Come.
How do you do? - Fine.

185
00:16:06,512 --> 00:16:08,639
l have spoken to him.

186
00:16:09,815 --> 00:16:12,181
What is your opinion, inspector?
- Yes..

187
00:16:12,385 --> 00:16:15,354
Devendra the case is very strange.
Hello inspector.

188
00:16:15,454 --> 00:16:18,582
Hello. - l feel this
girl has lost her memory.

189
00:16:22,094 --> 00:16:24,153
Why are you standing?
Come, sit down.

190
00:16:25,264 --> 00:16:26,856
Has she got hurt on the head?

191
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:31,497
No. lt's not visible. lf
its an internal wound..

192
00:16:32,371 --> 00:16:35,568
..then in such case people
usually lose their memory.

193
00:16:37,209 --> 00:16:40,906
lt's complicated; she
thinks she is Devendra's wife.

194
00:16:41,514 --> 00:16:43,311
Why? What is the reason?

195
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:48,250
Mr. Devendra, did you ever had
any liaison with this girl..

196
00:16:48,354 --> 00:16:51,414
No inspector. l have not
seen this girl earlier.

197
00:16:51,724 --> 00:16:55,285
How can a girl accept a
stranger as her husband?

198
00:16:55,695 --> 00:16:59,791
Why not? lnspector,
every day many girls write..

199
00:16:59,899 --> 00:17:01,526
..letters to our
boss about marriage.

200
00:17:02,234 --> 00:17:06,364
Many say they are bonded
with him for many lives.

201
00:17:06,605 --> 00:17:10,871
See. See.
- Maullana, Hanuman may be right.

202
00:17:12,378 --> 00:17:14,744
lt's possible that the girl
in her subconscious mind..

203
00:17:15,081 --> 00:17:17,379
..may have wanted to
become Devendra's wife.

204
00:17:18,417 --> 00:17:21,784
l think this is the case
of amnesia plus Visalia.

205
00:17:22,655 --> 00:17:25,818
Pandit is there any
treatment for this or not?

206
00:17:26,158 --> 00:17:29,218
Treatments do exist.
Such case takes time.

207
00:17:29,328 --> 00:17:33,458
No uncle. This isn't
your medical case.

208
00:17:33,866 --> 00:17:37,131
lt's a police case. l feel
she wants to entrap us..

209
00:17:37,236 --> 00:17:39,170
..and earn some money.

210
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,773
lt's possible there
are others involved.

211
00:17:42,108 --> 00:17:45,635
Though you are a writer.
You think like a lawyer.

212
00:17:46,412 --> 00:17:49,779
Like your father you too think
a rope is a snake in the dark.

213
00:17:49,882 --> 00:17:52,350
But.. - Even l don't
agree with your opinion.

214
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:54,609
But if you want then..

215
00:17:55,588 --> 00:17:56,748
Alright uncle.

216
00:17:56,856 --> 00:17:58,790
You take inspector Kulkarni out.

217
00:18:00,126 --> 00:18:01,650
Come inspector.

218
00:18:08,801 --> 00:18:13,397
lf l go, where should l go?

219
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:18,076
Where should l go?

220
00:18:18,677 --> 00:18:31,181
Everything is here. There is
nothing outside this house.

221
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:35,349
lf l go, where should l go?

222
00:18:35,461 --> 00:18:48,135
Everything is here. There is
nothing outside this house.

223
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:53,371
lf l go, where should l go?

224
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:13,225
Just like solitude
likes loneliness.

225
00:19:13,566 --> 00:19:21,473
The world calls out to you.

226
00:19:22,141 --> 00:19:25,804
By coming to your door..

227
00:19:28,547 --> 00:19:36,579
By coming to your door,
l don't want to return.

228
00:19:36,822 --> 00:19:41,282
lf l go, where should l go?

229
00:19:41,393 --> 00:19:53,863
Everything is here. There is
nothing outside this house.

230
00:19:54,139 --> 00:19:59,509
lf l go, where should l go?

231
00:20:15,461 --> 00:20:23,766
l am in love with you, beloved.

232
00:20:24,136 --> 00:20:32,168
l draped a veil gifted by you.

233
00:20:32,478 --> 00:20:36,278
l don't want to lift the veil..

234
00:20:38,851 --> 00:20:47,225
l don't want to lift
the veil anywhere else.

235
00:20:47,326 --> 00:20:51,490
lf l go, where should l go?

236
00:20:51,597 --> 00:21:04,135
Everything is here. There is
nothing outside this house.

237
00:21:04,243 --> 00:21:08,407
lf l go, where should l go?

238
00:21:08,514 --> 00:21:20,654
Everything is here. There is
nothing outside this house.

239
00:21:20,826 --> 00:21:26,731
lf l go, where should l go?

240
00:21:56,328 --> 00:21:58,353
You don't say no to the offerings.

241
00:22:14,413 --> 00:22:17,871
lnspector, do you
feel this girl is fraud?

242
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:21,217
Look, even innocent faces do cheat.

243
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,754
But l feel this girl
is from a good family.

244
00:22:25,324 --> 00:22:27,383
Pandit, what do you think?

245
00:22:27,793 --> 00:22:31,593
The way this girl thinks
she is Devendra's wife..

246
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:34,128
..as a medical man l suggest..

247
00:22:34,333 --> 00:22:36,392
..if you remove her out forcibly.

248
00:22:36,502 --> 00:22:38,470
Her mental condition
will worsen further.

249
00:22:38,904 --> 00:22:42,237
Then it will be better if
she stays here for some days.

250
00:22:42,574 --> 00:22:43,905
lsn't it, Deven?

251
00:22:44,643 --> 00:22:46,270
When you are of the same opinion.

252
00:22:46,378 --> 00:22:49,245
Then why do you ask me?
Do what you want?

253
00:22:49,715 --> 00:22:51,546
Don't involve me in this.

254
00:22:54,453 --> 00:22:58,150
Alright. Come to the
police station and sign the FlR.

255
00:22:58,457 --> 00:23:01,517
lf we get the doctor's
report we'll attach that too.

256
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,524
And after that if required
we will print the girls snap.

257
00:23:05,831 --> 00:23:08,425
That will be fine.
- Shall l leave? - Yes.

258
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:15,165
Hanuman, come to the
dispensary and take the medicines.

259
00:23:15,274 --> 00:23:18,641
For the inspector, right?
- No. For that girl.

260
00:23:20,579 --> 00:23:22,479
Why do you shout?

261
00:23:36,795 --> 00:23:39,161
Mrs. Chopra. Come in.

262
00:23:43,702 --> 00:23:48,730
Oh my, please. Handsome.
- Yes, my dear.

263
00:23:48,841 --> 00:23:51,309
You used to come in my dream.

264
00:23:51,543 --> 00:23:54,341
That is why l visit
you during the day.

265
00:23:54,446 --> 00:23:57,779
Really?
- Yes. l don't tell lies, darling.

266
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:03,479
Hanuman. - Who is it?
You? How did you come in?

267
00:24:04,189 --> 00:24:08,592
Don't you see l am busy? Out. Out!!

268
00:24:08,694 --> 00:24:13,154
And look no one
should come in. Stupid.

269
00:24:16,468 --> 00:24:19,494
Darling, people don't
allow two hearts to meet.

270
00:24:19,605 --> 00:24:23,871
Don't let them live.
- Yes. Don't allow to live.

271
00:24:24,143 --> 00:24:29,706
Don't allow to die. - Don't
allow to live. Don't allow to die.

272
00:24:29,815 --> 00:24:37,847
Jaan. Jaan.
- Hey. Hey. Your name? - Hanuman.

273
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:40,451
Hanuman.
- Give the doctor's prescription.

274
00:24:41,627 --> 00:24:45,290
Prescription. - Expenditure?
Earlier doctors asked for fees.

275
00:24:45,397 --> 00:24:46,830
Now they ask the expenditure.

276
00:24:46,932 --> 00:24:48,627
Have you come to meet the doctor?
- No.

277
00:24:48,734 --> 00:24:51,931
No?
- Yes. Yes. - Then go in. Go inside.

278
00:24:52,304 --> 00:24:53,430
l'm going inside.

279
00:24:57,943 --> 00:24:59,535
l'm going.

280
00:25:01,346 --> 00:25:02,711
Hanuman, come.

281
00:25:05,184 --> 00:25:06,344
Sit down.

282
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:13,321
l have written a
prescription for the girl.

283
00:25:13,425 --> 00:25:14,653
Take the medicines from the chemist.

284
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:19,629
Yawn?
- Take medicines from the chemist.

285
00:25:20,232 --> 00:25:21,392
Oh!

286
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:27,568
Doctor, sometimes
it pains a lot here.

287
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,874
l will check it. Remove
your court and lie down there.

288
00:25:42,921 --> 00:25:45,651
Does it pain here?
- Yes. - Since when?

289
00:25:45,824 --> 00:25:47,485
There is no cough.

290
00:25:50,329 --> 00:25:52,194
Do you wear tight clothes at night?

291
00:25:52,297 --> 00:25:54,595
Yes. l also wear the pajamas.

292
00:25:55,534 --> 00:25:59,368
Do you wake up at night?
- How will the knot untie?

293
00:25:59,471 --> 00:26:01,632
l wear pajamas made of elastic.

294
00:26:06,278 --> 00:26:08,371
Take. Take this medicine from here.

295
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,074
Remember to wear
loose clothes at night.

296
00:26:11,183 --> 00:26:12,741
Yes. l will wet the clothes.

297
00:26:27,466 --> 00:26:28,626
Dolly.

298
00:26:30,369 --> 00:26:31,427
Dolly.

299
00:26:32,271 --> 00:26:34,136
Where has she gone?

300
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:50,916
What happened, dear?
Why are you crying?

301
00:26:52,424 --> 00:26:59,694
Uncle. Save me. Save me.

302
00:26:59,798 --> 00:27:01,197
What happened, dear?

303
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,734
lt seems you got
frightened in your dream.

304
00:27:04,703 --> 00:27:06,170
No.

305
00:27:07,339 --> 00:27:09,432
They are frightening me.

306
00:27:11,443 --> 00:27:13,843
They won't allow me
to live peacefully.

307
00:27:15,747 --> 00:27:17,738
Who is scaring you?

308
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:21,549
Those big unknown faces.

309
00:27:22,387 --> 00:27:29,657
And.. and..
- Yes dear. Try to remember. And?

310
00:27:33,298 --> 00:27:36,756
And l am standing on a hill.

311
00:27:38,503 --> 00:27:41,904
Your nephew is pushing me down.

312
00:27:43,575 --> 00:27:46,510
Below the wolves
are ready to eat me.

313
00:27:48,447 --> 00:27:52,213
Why does he push me?
Why is he angry with me?

314
00:27:53,151 --> 00:27:54,379
No dear.

315
00:27:55,454 --> 00:27:57,149
He is not angry with you.

316
00:27:57,522 --> 00:27:59,649
He is hungry for love.

317
00:28:00,158 --> 00:28:02,251
There is lot of difference in the..

318
00:28:02,361 --> 00:28:04,386
..Devendra of today
and a few years back.

319
00:28:05,497 --> 00:28:08,523
Then a girl had come
in his life. Sapna.

320
00:28:09,301 --> 00:28:12,270
Very beautiful. Good. Sweet girl.

321
00:28:12,671 --> 00:28:17,870
Did he love someone
else before he married me?

322
00:28:18,243 --> 00:28:19,767
He loved her a lot.

323
00:28:20,512 --> 00:28:23,675
He may have dreamt
many things with Sapna.

324
00:28:24,282 --> 00:28:26,682
Today he hates girls.

325
00:28:27,819 --> 00:28:29,582
Why does he hate?

326
00:28:29,888 --> 00:28:32,789
As all his dreams shattered.

327
00:28:33,859 --> 00:28:36,191
Without a word Sapna
married someone else..

328
00:28:36,294 --> 00:28:38,421
..and settled in England.

329
00:28:39,297 --> 00:28:43,324
l think may be she was helpless.
Or why would she go?

330
00:28:43,802 --> 00:28:46,134
But Devendra thinks differently.

331
00:28:46,304 --> 00:28:49,637
lf she was an lndian woman
she would think of herself..

332
00:28:49,741 --> 00:28:53,700
..her security. Her love
is just a show. Fraud.

333
00:28:54,446 --> 00:28:56,710
This is very strongly
embedded in his mind.

334
00:28:59,418 --> 00:29:02,353
l didn't know he was mentally upset.

335
00:29:04,489 --> 00:29:09,449
l will do away with all
the sorrows from his life.

336
00:29:20,872 --> 00:29:22,499
Not now.

337
00:29:32,084 --> 00:29:36,885
Bijlee. - Hey, what are
you doing? l am a maid here.

338
00:29:37,155 --> 00:29:41,524
You are not a maid but
the queen of my heart.

339
00:29:42,427 --> 00:29:49,697
And this hand. ls not for moping?
lt is for kissing.

340
00:29:50,469 --> 00:29:52,403
For kissing.

341
00:29:53,672 --> 00:29:56,869
Hanuman!
- My dear. - Hanuman!

342
00:29:57,576 --> 00:29:59,908
Sir.
- What nonsense is this?

343
00:30:01,113 --> 00:30:04,344
That.. l was thinking
of a plot for the novel.

344
00:30:04,449 --> 00:30:07,850
Something strange.
- Send this to Delhi.

00:30:08,653 --> 00:30:13,647
Cat? - Delhi. - Delhi.

346
00:30:14,326 --> 00:30:16,294

Send it.
- Send it. - Yes.

348
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:29,133
Hey, get up.
- Stupid, why are you touching me?

349
00:30:29,241 --> 00:30:32,210
Don't you have a mother or sister?
- No. No.

350
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:35,746
l came to help you.
- Why did you come to help?

351
00:30:35,847 --> 00:30:39,749
You. - Stupid. l will
crash you. - l came to help.

352
00:30:43,588 --> 00:30:46,682
She bites. She bites.
- Go.

353
00:30:47,559 --> 00:30:49,356
What are you doing, aunt?

354
00:30:52,564 --> 00:30:54,862
Oh God! What happened?

355
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,499
What happened, aunt?
- Look at her face.

356
00:30:58,837 --> 00:31:00,737
lt seems she was
hungry the whole night.

357
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:04,706
Come. Get up quickly.
Give her some tea.

358
00:31:05,143 --> 00:31:08,670
Or she will die.
- Oh God. When will aunt realize?

359
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:12,113
l am fed up explaining to her.
- Why?

360
00:31:12,317 --> 00:31:14,251
Does a doll have tea?

361
00:31:19,124 --> 00:31:23,254
Dolly takes nice care of her toys.

362
00:31:23,562 --> 00:31:26,190
But you don't take
care of your health.

363
00:31:26,665 --> 00:31:28,690
Last night you were again
having breathing problem, right?

364
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:31,462
Oh, what's there to worry?
l had breathing problem.

365
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:33,629
But it didn't stop.
- Don't say that.

366
00:31:33,872 --> 00:31:36,432
Now l won't let you be careless.

367
00:31:36,675 --> 00:31:39,769
When the sunsets you will have food.

368
00:31:40,212 --> 00:31:43,272
Today you won't get
anything other than soup and rice.

369
00:31:43,448 --> 00:31:45,814
Alright.
- Sir, the laundry man is here.

370
00:31:46,585 --> 00:31:50,544
Uncle Ramu, don't trouble
uncle for such minor things.

371
00:31:51,423 --> 00:31:54,790
Let me check.
- Ram Lakhan. - Yes.

372
00:31:56,561 --> 00:31:58,552
lf l get a daughter in law
she should be like this.

373
00:31:59,164 --> 00:32:01,758
You robbed my words.

374
00:32:08,573 --> 00:32:11,201
Listen. Listen.

375
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:14,404
You? What are you doing here?

376
00:32:14,879 --> 00:32:17,541
l am scared.
- Scared? Why are you scared?

377
00:32:17,649 --> 00:32:19,708
Whom are you
frightened of? Go to your room.

378
00:32:20,118 --> 00:32:23,212
Let me sleep with you. - Look,
you are crossing your limits.

379
00:32:23,321 --> 00:32:24,481
You are crossing your limits.

380
00:32:24,656 --> 00:32:28,387
Oh!
- What are you doing? Leave me.

381
00:32:30,262 --> 00:32:31,889
Why are you scolding?

382
00:32:32,163 --> 00:32:34,324
lf l sleep here will l
rob something of yours?

383
00:32:34,432 --> 00:32:36,662
Will you get up or not?
Go to your room.

384
00:32:37,535 --> 00:32:40,561
Stupid. You never speak lovingly.

385
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:43,901
Take this pillow.
Hold it and go to sleep.

386
00:32:44,643 --> 00:32:46,838
May god not let you fall asleep?

387
00:32:55,654 --> 00:32:59,886
Should l really go?
- Yes. Get lost. Leave me alone.

388
00:33:00,158 --> 00:33:03,286
lf that is so, then l won't go.
l will sleep here itself.

389
00:33:03,461 --> 00:33:05,224
l have a right on this bed.

390
00:33:07,499 --> 00:33:10,093
What do you think of yourself?
- Your wife.

391
00:33:10,635 --> 00:33:12,830
Forget this act. Listen carefully.

392
00:33:13,104 --> 00:33:15,163
You have no tie
with this house or me.

393
00:33:15,273 --> 00:33:17,434
We picked you up from the road.
- That's a lie.

394
00:33:17,542 --> 00:33:20,534
lt's isn't a lie. You
are living on our mercy.

395
00:33:20,745 --> 00:33:22,610
No one knows who you are.
What you are?

396
00:33:22,714 --> 00:33:25,877
Where you come from?
- No. No. This is my house.

397
00:33:26,151 --> 00:33:28,915
This isn't your house.
lt is not. Get out.

398
00:33:31,323 --> 00:33:34,121
lf you ever step in this room,
l will break your legs.

399
00:33:57,816 --> 00:33:59,181
Sit down.

400
00:34:06,524 --> 00:34:09,288
lf you get a chance
to do something good.

401
00:34:09,494 --> 00:34:11,359
Then you must thank
god that he has given..

402
00:34:11,463 --> 00:34:13,488
..you the opportunity
to do this good deed.

403
00:34:13,732 --> 00:34:16,166
He gave us this opportunity
that we can help someone.

404
00:34:16,668 --> 00:34:20,536
lt's not that you first
shelter a helpless, innocent girl.

405
00:34:21,172 --> 00:34:23,163
After that make it
impossible for her to live.

406
00:34:23,274 --> 00:34:26,437
Uncle, what happened?
- No uncle. Only doctor.

407
00:34:26,711 --> 00:34:30,909
Being a doctor l am
asking you what her fault is.

408
00:34:31,182 --> 00:34:34,413
That you scolded her. You
hurt her feeling so much.

409
00:34:34,519 --> 00:34:36,714
That she was
unconscious the whole night.

410
00:34:36,821 --> 00:34:39,654
Unconscious?
- Yes. lf you wanted to do this.

411
00:34:39,758 --> 00:34:41,521
Then you shouldn't
have brought her home.

412
00:34:41,893 --> 00:34:43,588
You should have let
the goons carry her away.

413
00:34:43,695 --> 00:34:45,458
You could let her
run pillar to post.

414
00:34:46,131 --> 00:34:48,190
lf she someday would
become a prostitute..

415
00:34:48,299 --> 00:34:50,426
..you wouldn't care.

416
00:34:50,835 --> 00:34:53,133
You would find a new
character for your novel.

417
00:34:53,238 --> 00:34:55,536
But uncle. l didn't
know about this. Really?

418
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,608
No one informed me.
- How could anyone inform you?

419
00:34:58,276 --> 00:35:00,744
lf you were a normal person
anyone would share their sorrow.

420
00:35:00,845 --> 00:35:05,111
You are off your top
at home. lt's shameful.

421
00:35:05,216 --> 00:35:08,151
Being the owner of the
house you don't know anything.

422
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:16,651
Look dear, you know
she has lost her memory.

423
00:35:17,429 --> 00:35:21,490
ln such a condition if
you are strict with her.

424
00:35:21,766 --> 00:35:23,791
She can become more shocked.

425
00:35:24,235 --> 00:35:28,331
Do you want a jovial
person should go mad due to you?

426
00:35:29,908 --> 00:35:32,433
l am sorry, uncle.
- lt's alright.

427
00:35:33,812 --> 00:35:36,781
Let me go. Bye.
- Bye.

428
00:35:40,418 --> 00:35:43,478
Wow! Pandit. You
shouldn't have been a doctor.

429
00:35:43,588 --> 00:35:48,457
But a maulvi at some Masjid.
What a speech?

430
00:35:55,533 --> 00:35:58,434
Doctor, this..
- Not doctor. Uncle.

431
00:36:00,238 --> 00:36:04,470
l came to ask how her health is.

432
00:36:05,076 --> 00:36:10,343
Oh! She is much better.
But she requires rest.

433
00:36:12,784 --> 00:36:14,547
Alright.

434
00:36:21,125 --> 00:36:24,117
Ram Lakhan, serve dinner quickly.

435
00:36:27,232 --> 00:36:30,258
Son, are you back?
Where had you gone?

436
00:36:30,869 --> 00:36:33,599
Doctor uncle had
called me in the evening.

437
00:36:33,805 --> 00:36:36,171
There was a meeting of writers.

438
00:36:36,708 --> 00:36:38,107
Did you have dinner?

439
00:36:38,209 --> 00:36:39,870
Yes. l just did.

440
00:36:40,712 --> 00:36:42,839
Did your daughter eat food?

441
00:36:43,214 --> 00:36:45,580
Dolly? She has finished long back.

442
00:36:46,885 --> 00:36:51,686
And your other daughter?

443
00:36:52,557 --> 00:36:53,819
Other daughter?

444
00:36:53,925 --> 00:36:55,586
Which other daughter?

445
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:57,623
What do l say?

446
00:36:58,196 --> 00:37:00,630
Your daughter
without a name. Anamika.

447
00:37:00,798 --> 00:37:03,790
Wow! You gave a good name to her.

448
00:37:04,068 --> 00:37:06,662
Anamika. The one who has no name.

449
00:37:06,771 --> 00:37:09,501
Yes uncle. You need
a name to call out.

450
00:37:10,375 --> 00:37:15,677
How is she now? - lt seems
doctor's dose has started working.

451
00:37:16,781 --> 00:37:19,443
Did she eat something?
- No dear.

452
00:37:19,551 --> 00:37:22,679
Until you don't eat
she doesn't eat too.

453
00:37:23,688 --> 00:37:26,452
This girl will make me mad one day.

454
00:37:27,458 --> 00:37:30,359
She says it's her duty.

455
00:37:32,096 --> 00:37:34,587
Why does she make me unreligious?

456
00:37:34,699 --> 00:37:38,567
Tell her to eat food on my behalf.

457
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:40,431
And take care of her health.

458
00:37:53,918 --> 00:37:56,478
Listen aunt.
- Catch me.

459
00:38:07,165 --> 00:38:08,723
Wait aunt.

460
00:38:10,602 --> 00:38:15,562
Dolly.
- Aunt, wait. - Dolly.

461
00:38:30,488 --> 00:38:32,353
Go and change your clothes.
Go to your room.

462
00:38:32,457 --> 00:38:33,890
Go quickly.
- Okay aunt.

463
00:38:49,307 --> 00:38:53,710
Good. Yogi
Vishwamitra is not in his room.

464
00:39:33,217 --> 00:39:37,586
Aren't you ashamed?
Why are you staring?

465
00:39:39,657 --> 00:39:43,821
But why should l feel shy
of you? You are everything.

466
00:39:44,195 --> 00:39:46,663
My body, soul everything is for you.

467
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,459
Watch.

468
00:40:00,878 --> 00:40:03,676
You were saying that
you aren't shy of me.

469
00:40:04,348 --> 00:40:07,715
That.. that l was
speaking to your picture.

470
00:40:14,192 --> 00:40:17,559
l am Vishwamitra.
Then you are my Menka.

471
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:21,162
You broke my meditation.

472
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:25,298
Really?
- Yes.

473
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:27,669
l worship you.

474
00:40:28,773 --> 00:40:33,608
And you, my god.

475
00:40:53,664 --> 00:40:57,327
You are very fat. Eat less.

476
00:41:03,174 --> 00:41:04,471
Oh no!

477
00:41:25,596 --> 00:41:28,190
Ram Lakhan.
- Yes. Yes sir.

478
00:41:28,766 --> 00:41:30,734
There are a few packets
in the car, get them.

479
00:41:32,637 --> 00:41:34,730
Uncle, did you get something for me?

480
00:41:34,839 --> 00:41:38,639
No dear. lts saris.
- Oh god! l never were saris.

481
00:41:40,378 --> 00:41:43,814
That's for your aunt.
- Alright. Aunt.

482
00:41:44,816 --> 00:41:46,477
Aunt. Aunt.

483
00:41:47,552 --> 00:41:49,850
That.. give her the saris.

484
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:55,252
Deven.
- Yes.

485
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:58,319
l had gone to the police
station in the evening.

486
00:41:58,863 --> 00:42:02,162
Police station?
- The advertisement we gave..

487
00:42:02,266 --> 00:42:05,133
..about Anamika had no result.

488
00:42:05,803 --> 00:42:09,603
l was thinking that we should
hand her over to the police.

489
00:42:10,708 --> 00:42:12,369
How long will she stay here?

490
00:42:13,477 --> 00:42:16,503
Did you ask her? ls she ready to go?

491
00:42:16,614 --> 00:42:19,606
She will want to live here forever.
Will we keep her?

492
00:42:21,252 --> 00:42:26,280
Since she has come your
studies are pending. Secondly..

493
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:28,858
Uncle. Why don't we
see for another few days?

494
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:30,488
May be she will get well.

495
00:42:34,265 --> 00:42:37,234
Alright uncle. l will
take doctor uncle's advice.

496
00:42:37,435 --> 00:42:40,233
Then.. let's see.

497
00:42:41,505 --> 00:42:45,839
The saris are so good. Look.
lt's very pretty.

498
00:43:05,496 --> 00:43:07,225
Now on don't wear my clothes.

499
00:44:42,226 --> 00:44:48,358
Come embrace me.

500
00:44:48,833 --> 00:44:54,897
Come embrace me.

501
00:44:56,140 --> 00:45:02,170
Why are you shy of me?

502
00:45:02,713 --> 00:45:08,515
Why are you shy of me?

503
00:45:08,886 --> 00:45:20,388
This intimacy is not of now.
lt's for lifetime.

504
00:45:22,166 --> 00:45:28,127
Come embrace me.

505
00:45:29,106 --> 00:45:35,136
Why are you shy of me?

506
00:45:36,447 --> 00:45:41,578
Why are you shy of me?

507
00:45:54,932 --> 00:46:06,571
lf you have to go. Hiding.
Then why did you hold my wrist?

508
00:46:07,778 --> 00:46:19,280
lf you have to go. Hiding.
Then why did you hold my wrist?

509
00:46:19,590 --> 00:46:31,263
No one let's one to go away.

510
00:46:32,136 --> 00:46:37,472
Come embrace me.

511
00:46:40,211 --> 00:46:44,807
Why are you shy of me?

512
00:46:46,550 --> 00:46:51,419
Why are you shy of me?

513
00:47:04,602 --> 00:47:10,336
Sometime do speak to me.

514
00:47:11,308 --> 00:47:16,610
At least meet me
with a broad mind.

515
00:47:17,548 --> 00:47:23,145
Sometime do speak to me.

516
00:47:23,821 --> 00:47:29,259
At least meet me
with a broad mind.

517
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:40,794
This night is ours. You are mine.
l am not scared of anyone.

518
00:47:42,239 --> 00:47:47,734
Come embrace me.

519
00:47:50,147 --> 00:47:54,914
Why are you shy of me?

520
00:47:55,352 --> 00:48:00,756
Why are you shy of me?

521
00:48:01,158 --> 00:48:12,831
This intimacy is not of now.
lt's for lifetime.

522
00:48:13,837 --> 00:48:19,707
Come embrace me.

523
00:48:21,812 --> 00:48:27,079
Why are you shy of me?

524
00:48:28,385 --> 00:48:33,618
Why are you shy of me?

525
00:48:40,598 --> 00:48:44,193
Yes.
- ls Mr. Devendra in? - Dharmendra?

526
00:48:44,368 --> 00:48:47,633
Not Dharmendra. But Devendra.
- Oh, sir.

527
00:48:47,738 --> 00:48:49,501
Yes.
- Come. Sit down.

528
00:48:51,342 --> 00:48:54,436
Did you call up
yesterday for the appointment?

529
00:48:54,545 --> 00:48:59,380
Yes. - Wait for sometime.
- How long? - 28 seconds.

530
00:48:59,750 --> 00:49:02,651
Oh, you take care of every second.
- Yes.

531
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:05,584
The boss says Hanuman
the one who doesn't..

532
00:49:05,689 --> 00:49:08,453
..value small things
can never be great ever.

533
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:14,259
l am the boss' secretary.
- You are very jovial.

534
00:49:15,132 --> 00:49:17,657
The time is up. Come.
- lt's over. - Come.

535
00:49:21,205 --> 00:49:23,503
Come.
- Hello Mr. Devendra. Hello.

536
00:49:23,607 --> 00:49:25,768
Naresh. How are you?
- Fine.

537
00:49:25,876 --> 00:49:27,844
How are you?
- Fine.

538
00:49:29,079 --> 00:49:30,842
How is Mr. Daulatram?

539
00:49:32,149 --> 00:49:36,882
What do l tell you? You
know what paralysis is?

540
00:49:37,421 --> 00:49:42,484
No thanks. - We are doing
medicines for one's joy.

541
00:49:44,795 --> 00:49:47,320
God always testing good people.

542
00:49:49,133 --> 00:49:51,658
l am very sorry to hear
about your elder brother.

543
00:49:52,903 --> 00:49:58,637
Yes. l have got some
copies of Anamika for you.

544
00:50:01,245 --> 00:50:02,473
Look.

545
00:50:04,214 --> 00:50:08,708
Tell me, how is it?
- Good. Very good.

546
00:50:08,819 --> 00:50:11,287
When are you
giving your other novel?

547
00:50:11,689 --> 00:50:15,523
l am working on that. l hope
it will complete next month.

548
00:50:16,293 --> 00:50:18,193
This is your royalty..

549
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:37,679
He is Naresh, the son of the
Delhi publisher, Padmaprakash.

550
00:50:37,915 --> 00:50:40,213
Hello.
- Hello.

551
00:50:54,965 --> 00:50:58,196
Do you recognize her, Naresh?
- No.

552
00:50:59,370 --> 00:51:04,535
l was surprised that a
girl is in your house.

553
00:51:06,410 --> 00:51:10,141
She has a strange story.
What is your program?

554
00:51:11,115 --> 00:51:14,243
Actually, l thought l will
return home in the evening.

555
00:51:14,918 --> 00:51:19,878
But l feel l will have
to wait for some days.

556
00:51:23,494 --> 00:51:28,124
Hey, this is that bungalow.
That is the girl's window.

557
00:51:28,399 --> 00:51:32,426
Tonight execute the work carefully.
Okay. - Okay.

558
00:55:13,290 --> 00:55:17,090
Dear, l am worried about Anamika.
She is very scared.

559
00:55:18,328 --> 00:55:20,626
Why don't we send her
away for a few days?

560
00:55:22,265 --> 00:55:25,325
Where do we send her? To whom?

561
00:55:25,602 --> 00:55:29,299
l was thinking we have
a property at Shimla.

562
00:55:29,673 --> 00:55:33,131
The newspaper says
yesterday there was lot of snow.

563
00:55:33,577 --> 00:55:35,204
The climate will also be good.

564
00:55:35,312 --> 00:55:37,303
Why don't we take
her to visit Shimla?

565
00:55:38,749 --> 00:55:40,376
lt's a good thought.

566
00:55:41,184 --> 00:55:43,243
But Dolly exams are approaching.

567
00:55:43,453 --> 00:55:44,750
How can she go?

568
00:55:46,857 --> 00:55:48,882
l will have to wait here for her.

569
00:55:49,793 --> 00:55:51,385
Why don't you both go?

570
00:55:51,695 --> 00:55:54,892
l will tell Anamika
to start preparing.

571
00:56:13,417 --> 00:56:17,217
Look that side a bit. That side.

572
00:56:18,622 --> 00:56:21,614
Go little behind.
- Not me. You go.

573
00:56:29,166 --> 00:56:32,101
Why are you laughing? What
is there to laugh about?

574
00:56:32,369 --> 00:56:35,634
Even carriages
fall on the war front.

575
00:56:45,248 --> 00:56:48,740
What's that?
- No.

576
00:56:53,657 --> 00:56:56,524
Laugh.
- What are you doing?

577
00:56:56,727 --> 00:56:58,388
What are you doing?

578
00:57:02,265 --> 00:57:05,063
What are you doing? Stop it.
l won't speak to you.

579
00:57:05,469 --> 00:57:07,699
Listen, where are you going?

580
00:57:14,244 --> 00:57:15,506
Anamika.

581
00:57:16,646 --> 00:57:19,308
Listen to me. Oh no.

582
00:57:19,416 --> 00:57:21,350
That's enough. Now halt.

583
00:57:22,252 --> 00:57:24,220
Amazing. You got angry
on such a small thing.

584
00:57:32,562 --> 00:57:34,655
Enough. That's enough.

585
00:57:35,799 --> 00:57:37,130
Who are you?

586
00:57:37,234 --> 00:57:38,531
Why are you following me?

587
00:57:40,203 --> 00:57:44,663
l will follow you throughout life.
- Amazing.

588
00:57:44,841 --> 00:57:46,502
Trying to be friendly when
we don't know each other.

589
00:57:46,610 --> 00:57:47,702
Aunt.

590
00:57:49,746 --> 00:57:51,407
l salute you.

591
00:57:52,516 --> 00:57:54,882
Forget this joke. Let's have coffee.

592
00:57:55,318 --> 00:57:58,651
Come.
- Leave my hand. Or l will scream.

593
00:57:58,889 --> 00:58:01,357
You will scream?
- Yes. - Do that. Come.

594
00:58:01,591 --> 00:58:04,560
Save me. Save me
from this goon. Please!

595
00:58:04,795 --> 00:58:08,697
Save me. Save me. Come soon.
- They are coming.

596
00:58:08,799 --> 00:58:11,700
They will think it's true.
- Then you will know. Save me.

597
00:58:11,802 --> 00:58:13,269
What happened? What happened?

598
00:58:13,370 --> 00:58:15,395
Look this loafer is following me.

599
00:58:15,505 --> 00:58:17,496
He held my hand and
proposes love to me.

600
00:58:17,607 --> 00:58:20,804
She is joking. Joking.
- Joke? Not at all.

601
00:58:21,077 --> 00:58:23,841
He took my muffler too.
-You are shameless.

602
00:58:24,247 --> 00:58:26,875
Don't you have anyone at home?
Go and love them.

603
00:58:27,150 --> 00:58:31,086
l will check his love.
- Hello.

604
00:58:31,188 --> 00:58:36,820
Hey, Tarzen in town. You
look like Sanjeev Kumar.

605
00:58:37,194 --> 00:58:39,094
But you act like Pran.

606
00:58:40,697 --> 00:58:42,358
Sardarji, do your work.

607
00:58:42,465 --> 00:58:44,592
The matter is between us.
- Our matter?

608
00:58:45,135 --> 00:58:49,765
Hey, what is he saying?
- He is lying. Loafer.

609
00:58:50,340 --> 00:58:54,436
Tell me one thing. White lie.
Who is she of yours?

610
00:58:54,744 --> 00:58:56,336
A.. that..

611
00:58:56,746 --> 00:59:00,477
Why don't you speak?
Or l will slap you?

612
00:59:00,750 --> 00:59:04,686
Strange people. She is my..
- Did you see?

613
00:59:05,055 --> 00:59:09,151
He is still in a trance of love.
- We will handle that just now.

614
00:59:09,259 --> 00:59:11,853
Beat him!
- Beat him! - Beat him!

615
00:59:12,128 --> 00:59:19,330
People.. don't beat him.

616
00:59:26,476 --> 00:59:30,640
He is my..

617
00:59:33,383 --> 00:59:36,819
Beloved.

618
00:59:56,506 --> 01:00:07,440
People, don't beat him.
He is my beloved.

619
01:00:09,219 --> 01:00:20,255
The heart met the heart.
lt's not enmity. lt's love.

620
01:00:22,198 --> 01:00:28,137
We had a small fight. We
thought it was a fight.

621
01:00:28,538 --> 01:00:34,773
Sweet talks about our love.

622
01:00:35,145 --> 01:00:37,773
Why is my beloved angry?

623
01:00:38,248 --> 01:00:41,274
You are my sweet dream.

624
01:00:41,651 --> 01:00:47,146
Here, sweetheart. l lost.
My aim back fired.

625
01:00:47,657 --> 01:00:50,649
Why is my beloved angry?

626
01:00:50,927 --> 01:00:53,862
You are my sweet dream.

627
01:00:53,964 --> 01:00:59,766
Here, sweetheart. l lost.
My aim back fired.

628
01:01:00,403 --> 01:01:03,497
Why is my beloved angry?

629
01:01:25,929 --> 01:01:36,897
May my life blossom
with your presence.

630
01:01:38,274 --> 01:01:49,617
May l always be happy. May
this happiness not vanish.

631
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:56,852
Your love, my youth.
Your love, my youth.

632
01:01:56,960 --> 01:02:02,626
l love you. l worship you.
This is my story.

633
01:02:03,199 --> 01:02:05,861
Why is my beloved angry?

634
01:02:06,136 --> 01:02:08,900
You are my sweet dream.

635
01:02:09,406 --> 01:02:14,776
Here, sweetheart. l lost.
My aim back fired.

636
01:02:15,311 --> 01:02:17,404
Why is my beloved angry?

637
01:02:17,881 --> 01:02:21,112
You are my sweet dream.

638
01:02:21,451 --> 01:02:26,787
Here, sweetheart. l lost.
My aim back fired.

639
01:02:27,357 --> 01:02:30,190
Why is my beloved angry?

640
01:02:30,293 --> 01:02:33,160
You are my sweet dream.

641
01:02:33,263 --> 01:02:35,595
Why is my beloved angry?

642
01:02:35,698 --> 01:02:38,690
You are my sweet dream.

643
01:02:48,778 --> 01:02:50,245
Did you say something?

644
01:02:52,449 --> 01:02:53,780
l don't know, Anamika.

645
01:02:54,150 --> 01:02:56,948
Sometimes l feel you are
saying something to me.

646
01:02:59,422 --> 01:03:04,155
Actually, writers have their
own world in their thoughts.

647
01:03:04,594 --> 01:03:07,119
They create their
own things in them.

648
01:03:07,697 --> 01:03:12,430
They speak to them. But
when your thoughts break.

649
01:03:13,369 --> 01:03:17,738
The whole world disappears.
lsn't it?

650
01:03:19,843 --> 01:03:24,280
Anamika, don't you imagine?

651
01:03:25,715 --> 01:03:30,550
What should l imagine?
- That who are you?

652
01:03:30,653 --> 01:03:34,453
Where do you come from?
You may have a mother.

653
01:03:34,724 --> 01:03:37,921
Who gave birth to you! Some father.

654
01:03:38,461 --> 01:03:43,455
Who may have brought you
up lovingly. Some house.

655
01:03:43,833 --> 01:03:47,462
The courtyard of the
house may be waiting for you.

656
01:03:54,144 --> 01:03:57,580
Can this leaf say
from where it has come?

657
01:03:57,780 --> 01:03:59,407
Which tree has it fallen? -

658
01:04:03,620 --> 01:04:04,848
No.

659
01:04:05,522 --> 01:04:07,387
lt surely can't say anything.

660
01:04:08,458 --> 01:04:10,187
But l surely know.

661
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:15,527
When it sprouted the
valley was in blossom.

662
01:04:45,828 --> 01:04:47,591
Anamika?

663
01:04:51,668 --> 01:04:53,226
This picture?

664
01:04:55,405 --> 01:04:57,134
l didn't click this picture.

665
01:04:59,309 --> 01:05:03,473
Maybe, with this l can
find out about her parents.

666
01:05:03,713 --> 01:05:05,180
Take this.

667
01:05:06,516 --> 01:05:10,316
Five was given in advance.
Deduct Rs.5 from your bill.

668
01:05:10,420 --> 01:05:14,789
Listen. Listen. How
did you get that picture?

669
01:05:18,528 --> 01:05:22,328
She allotted it to me.
She allotted it.

670
01:05:22,632 --> 01:05:25,328
Did you click this
picture in your studio? - No.

671
01:05:25,435 --> 01:05:29,371
Last season some one ordered it.
- Ordered.

672
01:05:29,472 --> 01:05:30,871
He didn't return to take the snap.

673
01:05:31,474 --> 01:05:33,908
You may be having his
name in your record.

674
01:05:34,177 --> 01:05:37,146
Surely. Definitely. l
will tell you just now.

675
01:05:40,250 --> 01:05:41,774
lf l pay the bill of that person.

676
01:05:42,218 --> 01:05:43,708
Can you give me this picture?

677
01:05:43,820 --> 01:05:46,846
Why not? lf l am getting
the payment then who..

678
01:05:47,257 --> 01:05:52,661
..will not give. Here is the snap.

679
01:05:54,230 --> 01:06:00,863
Sir, our business is such.

01:06:10,747 --> 01:06:12,840
Hotel Clarkes?

683
01:06:17,654 --> 01:06:22,421
Right sir. Yes sir.
No sir, don't worry.

684
01:06:22,525 --> 01:06:25,619
l will arrange for the car.
Yes sir at 10 o'clock sharp.

685
01:06:26,562 --> 01:06:31,295
Which date did you say?
- 17th April, Mr. G. P. Malhotra.

686
01:06:34,137 --> 01:06:35,604
No sir. l don't think so.

687
01:06:37,206 --> 01:06:39,504
Then too there is no
arrangement about the night.

688
01:06:39,709 --> 01:06:42,507
You should be back in time.
Thank you, sir.

689
01:06:46,349 --> 01:06:50,342
Here. Mr. and Mrs. Malhotra.
- Mrs. Malhotra?

690
01:06:51,187 --> 01:06:55,487
Mrs. Or Miss.
- Mrs. Mrs. Malhotra.

691
01:06:55,692 --> 01:06:58,217
Look, they have written it.

692
01:07:03,633 --> 01:07:06,067
Were you here at that moment?
- Yes. Why?

693
01:07:06,502 --> 01:07:08,163
Can you recognize her?

694
01:07:11,107 --> 01:07:13,132
O yes. She is Mrs. Malhotra.

695
01:07:14,877 --> 01:07:19,314
l remember about them as they
had a fight on the first night.

696
01:07:19,415 --> 01:07:22,350
Mrs. Malhotra left
the hotel in anger.

697
01:07:25,121 --> 01:07:28,181
Can you give me her address?

698
01:07:29,659 --> 01:07:32,253
Dual advertising service,
Rustom Mahal.

699
01:07:32,362 --> 01:07:36,458
Marine drive. Bombay.
- Thank you.

700
01:07:44,540 --> 01:07:46,508
Hello. Hello.

701
01:07:56,753 --> 01:08:03,454
Sir.
- Hey, who is it? What is it?

702
01:08:03,559 --> 01:08:06,756
Keep your legs up. l want to mop.

703
01:08:07,764 --> 01:08:12,167
l am telling you to keep
your legs up. l want to mop.

704
01:08:12,268 --> 01:08:15,499
Beat. Beat. Your
language is very sweet.

705
01:08:15,705 --> 01:08:20,074
Oh my god! l am telling
you l have a bad temper.

706
01:08:20,610 --> 01:08:24,512
You talk sweetly. Beat. Beat.

707
01:08:51,774 --> 01:08:54,265
Secretary, what are you searching?

708
01:09:04,353 --> 01:09:07,117
Hey, you returned. God bless.

709
01:09:07,223 --> 01:09:08,850
You returned so soon from Shimla.

710
01:09:09,125 --> 01:09:11,457
He got bored. He said
let's go back to Bombay.

711
01:09:12,762 --> 01:09:16,254
Why? What's the matter?
Didn't you like Shimla?

712
01:09:16,432 --> 01:09:19,196
Are you fine?
- Uncle, nothing is the matter.

713
01:09:19,402 --> 01:09:21,427
Okay. He only says
nothing is the matter.

714
01:09:21,771 --> 01:09:23,295
He didn't speak to
me at all on the way.

715
01:09:23,873 --> 01:09:26,433
Uncle, writers have that habit?
- What?

716
01:09:26,542 --> 01:09:28,134
Like a chicken..

717
01:09:33,382 --> 01:09:36,374
Come up. Aunt, come up.

718
01:09:40,122 --> 01:09:41,680
Uncle, come with me.

719
01:09:45,328 --> 01:09:48,786
Hello. Naresh speaking.
- Sir, l am Bhosale from Bombay.

720
01:09:48,898 --> 01:09:50,525
Yes tell me. What's the news?

721
01:09:50,766 --> 01:09:52,165
They have just reached home.

722
01:09:52,368 --> 01:09:54,461
Who? Devendra and that girl.
- Yes.

723
01:09:56,172 --> 01:09:57,867
Alright. Keep an eye on them.

724
01:09:58,140 --> 01:09:59,732
l am coming to Bombay
by the evening flight.

725
01:09:59,909 --> 01:10:02,469
Why god doesn't
like to see me happy?

726
01:10:02,778 --> 01:10:04,473
Why does he bless me?

727
01:10:07,383 --> 01:10:09,851
l had turned away from women.

728
01:10:10,653 --> 01:10:14,145
lf she was someone
else's wife then..

729
01:10:14,257 --> 01:10:16,191
..why did she come in my life?

730
01:10:18,194 --> 01:10:20,822
We cannot control what happens.

731
01:10:22,231 --> 01:10:23,926
The one we don't have the
right on, what kind of..

732
01:10:24,333 --> 01:10:25,891
..feelings for her?
What kind of love?

733
01:10:27,236 --> 01:10:32,196
Think it was a gusty wind. lt
brought happiness for a few days.

734
01:10:33,576 --> 01:10:37,706
Sometime l feel l
should forget everything.

735
01:10:38,714 --> 01:10:40,341
Forget that she is someone's wife.

736
01:10:40,650 --> 01:10:43,585
Forget that.. l got the picture.

737
01:10:44,954 --> 01:10:49,288
Listen, did you inform
Anamika about the picture?

738
01:10:49,792 --> 01:10:51,157
No.

739
01:10:52,295 --> 01:10:54,286
lt's useless telling her.

740
01:10:55,264 --> 01:10:56,891
Whether she remembers or not.

741
01:10:57,300 --> 01:10:59,427
Now she is someone's possessions.

742
01:10:59,835 --> 01:11:03,362
We have to return that possession.
- Yes dear.

743
01:11:03,472 --> 01:11:06,373
Even Malhotra may be
worried about his wife.

744
01:11:06,475 --> 01:11:09,876
Mr. Malhotra.
- Yes.

745
01:11:13,115 --> 01:11:16,243
l have got good news for you.
- Please sit down.

746
01:11:20,890 --> 01:11:23,154
Will you have gin?
- No thanks.

747
01:11:30,533 --> 01:11:33,195
Tell me. What is your problem?

748
01:11:35,237 --> 01:11:39,367
l have come to return your wife.

749
01:11:39,675 --> 01:11:47,480
Wife? Why do you insult a bachelor?

750
01:11:47,717 --> 01:11:50,242
l haven't thought of marriage yet.

751
01:11:53,489 --> 01:11:57,323
But, are you Mr. Ganga
Prasad Malhotra? - Yes.

752
01:11:57,426 --> 01:12:00,759
But those days are over long back.

753
01:12:01,130 --> 01:12:03,189
Now l am only G. P. Malhotra.

754
01:12:03,299 --> 01:12:06,359
G for live. P for drink.
Live and drink.

755
01:12:07,370 --> 01:12:10,430
Why did you go to
Shimla last season?

756
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:14,167
l go to Shimla without any
reason during the season.

757
01:12:15,544 --> 01:12:19,878
But you booked a suite in the
name of Mr. & Mrs. Malhotra.

758
01:12:21,384 --> 01:12:24,717
Look. l am from the
publicity business.

759
01:12:25,254 --> 01:12:28,746
You need a girl for publicity.
A room for the girl.

760
01:12:29,291 --> 01:12:35,161
Taking advantage of a girl
and a room is my business art.

761
01:12:35,698 --> 01:12:37,791
That's my consumer surplus.

762
01:12:42,672 --> 01:12:44,230
Was this girl with you?

763
01:12:47,877 --> 01:12:49,606
Oh yes. lt was Kanchan.

764
01:12:49,812 --> 01:12:53,942
Kanchan? - Yes. The name
is Kanchan and the body too.

765
01:12:54,417 --> 01:12:56,783
But she always keeps an
eye on other's treasure.

766
01:12:57,653 --> 01:13:00,281
My friend, in the world of money..

767
01:13:00,389 --> 01:13:02,254
..many Kanchan's have perished.

768
01:13:02,491 --> 01:13:05,517
That night l fought with
her for the same reason.

769
01:13:05,895 --> 01:13:09,194
She said if you don't marry me now.

770
01:13:09,298 --> 01:13:10,890
l will make a commotion.

771
01:13:12,568 --> 01:13:15,128
Are you trapped by her?

772
01:13:15,905 --> 01:13:17,395
Yes. No.

773
01:13:18,641 --> 01:13:20,506
Do you know anything
about this Kanchan?

774
01:13:20,810 --> 01:13:25,509
Look, l don't take much
interest regarding girls.

775
01:13:26,115 --> 01:13:28,413
Then too if you want
to know something more.

776
01:13:28,517 --> 01:13:31,247
Then meet Miss Ruby.
- Miss Ruby?

777
01:13:31,454 --> 01:13:34,617
Yes. She is a cabaret
dancer in Hotel Oceana.

778
01:13:34,724 --> 01:13:37,215
With the name of Miss Rubia.

779
01:13:38,294 --> 01:13:42,924
Ladies and Gentlemen. The
most entertaining program..

780
01:13:43,365 --> 01:13:45,856
..of today which will
give you immense joy.

781
01:13:46,268 --> 01:13:49,260
Presenting to you the
famous cabaret dancer..

782
01:13:49,371 --> 01:13:52,169
..from lndia, Miss Rubia.

783
01:14:23,105 --> 01:14:26,836
Hello. Darling.
Darling, what's the matter?

784
01:14:27,309 --> 01:14:30,437
You haven't still come? Come soon.

785
01:14:30,679 --> 01:14:35,275
Look. Look. The climate
is so good. Come quickly.

786
01:14:35,384 --> 01:14:38,182
Oh, please come soon. Please.

787
01:15:16,358 --> 01:15:23,890
Tonight. Someone is about to come.

788
01:15:25,501 --> 01:15:30,336
Wait. Wait some more.

789
01:15:31,106 --> 01:15:38,376
Tonight. Someone is about to come.

790
01:15:38,647 --> 01:15:45,849
Let him come. My dear then
love him as much as you can.

791
01:16:48,817 --> 01:16:54,551
You didn't come.
Someone else did come.

792
01:16:55,457 --> 01:17:01,225
Come and save me. Save me.

793
01:17:03,132 --> 01:17:08,229
The enemies of my youth are here.

794
01:17:09,672 --> 01:17:16,771
How long will you take? Save me.

795
01:17:21,317 --> 01:17:26,812
lt shouldn't be that
your love is robbed.

796
01:17:34,763 --> 01:17:42,568
Tonight. Someone is about to come.

797
01:17:44,573 --> 01:17:49,704
Wait. Wait some more.

798
01:17:49,812 --> 01:17:57,583
Tonight. Someone is about to come.

799
01:17:57,886 --> 01:18:05,486
Let him come. My dear then
love him as much as you can.

800
01:18:21,143 --> 01:18:25,842
Come. Come now. Come.

801
01:20:14,189 --> 01:20:21,357
Tonight. Someone is about to come.

802
01:20:23,132 --> 01:20:28,126
Wait. Wait some more.

803
01:20:28,470 --> 01:20:35,740
Tonight. Someone is about to come.

804
01:20:36,445 --> 01:20:44,352
Let him come. My dear then
love him as much as you can.

805
01:21:02,337 --> 01:21:03,827
Give the order. Just a moment.

806
01:21:04,306 --> 01:21:05,534
Listen.
- Yes sir.

807
01:21:05,641 --> 01:21:06,733
Where is Miss Rubia's room?

808
01:21:07,142 --> 01:21:11,670
Go out from here. The room
opposite is hers. - Alright.

809
01:21:22,791 --> 01:21:24,520
Come in.

810
01:21:25,627 --> 01:21:28,425
l am sorry.
- lt's okay. Come in.

811
01:21:29,865 --> 01:21:32,698
Whiskey?
- No thanks.

812
01:21:33,168 --> 01:21:34,430
Didn't Kanchan come along?

813
01:21:36,772 --> 01:21:38,740
How long have you known her?
- Why?

814
01:21:39,274 --> 01:21:40,707
Hasn't she told you?

815
01:21:42,878 --> 01:21:44,175
l understood.

816
01:21:45,247 --> 01:21:48,512
Thus she was behaving
like a stranger in the hall.

817
01:21:49,351 --> 01:21:50,943
That's not her fault.

818
01:21:51,820 --> 01:21:53,788
Actually she has lost her memory.

819
01:21:55,557 --> 01:21:59,425
The girl is really clever.
And you very innocent.

820
01:21:59,928 --> 01:22:01,862
Cigarette.
- No thanks.

821
01:22:08,203 --> 01:22:10,671
Are you thinking of marrying her?

822
01:22:12,407 --> 01:22:14,466
You didn't tell me
what you know about her.

823
01:22:14,576 --> 01:22:16,203
l don't know anything.

824
01:22:16,712 --> 01:22:18,441
lf you must know
then ask the police.

825
01:22:19,548 --> 01:22:22,574
Who caught her in a raid?
- Raid?

826
01:22:24,152 --> 01:22:25,744
What raid?

827
01:22:27,189 --> 01:22:29,214
You really are a kid.

828
01:22:29,791 --> 01:22:33,124
Don't you know which kind of
woman is caught in a raid?

829
01:22:33,328 --> 01:22:35,660
She was selling her body.

830
01:22:39,801 --> 01:22:41,234
What proof do you have?

831
01:22:41,870 --> 01:22:43,838
Should l tell you
the customer's name?

832
01:22:44,406 --> 01:22:49,639
One was Mister.
- Please. Thanks.

833
01:23:07,596 --> 01:23:10,588
Listen. - Yes. - Where is
the one who had come with me?

834
01:23:10,699 --> 01:23:14,499
She left after you.
- After me? - Yes sir.

835
01:23:14,603 --> 01:23:16,400
Then she went out.

836
01:23:16,605 --> 01:23:17,697
How long ago?

837
01:23:17,806 --> 01:23:20,240
Some five-ten minutes.
- Was someone with her?

838
01:23:20,342 --> 01:23:21,206
No sir.

839
01:23:23,345 --> 01:23:24,835
Excuse me, sir.

840
01:23:30,530 --> 01:23:35,934
Dear, l just want to say
that such a good mannered girl.

841
01:23:36,136 --> 01:23:40,505
Her past is so bad.
lt's not possible.

842
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:42,667
Surely there is
some misunderstanding.

843
01:23:42,942 --> 01:23:45,001
Surely something is missing.

844
01:23:46,012 --> 01:23:48,446
No. There is no misunderstanding.

845
01:23:48,548 --> 01:23:52,541
There is nothing missing.
The matter is clearly evident.

846
01:23:52,652 --> 01:23:57,055
But you can't see it.
You are taken over by her.

847
01:23:57,991 --> 01:24:01,449
Tell me one thing. lf
she didn't know Rubia.

848
01:24:01,561 --> 01:24:03,586
Then when l went to meet her,
why did she follow me?

849
01:24:04,063 --> 01:24:07,430
Hearing our talks, why did she
disappear without informing?

850
01:24:08,601 --> 01:24:11,434
As she was frightened.

851
01:24:11,971 --> 01:24:15,964
Now she saw cracks in her dreams.

852
01:24:16,209 --> 01:24:20,270
The mask falling. Being
scared she left from our life.

853
01:24:21,181 --> 01:24:23,979
l don't agree.

854
01:24:24,417 --> 01:24:27,318
That Anamika's real self is
that what you are telling me.

855
01:24:27,420 --> 01:24:30,981
Whether you agree or not.
She lost her memory.

856
01:24:31,224 --> 01:24:34,250
She played games
with you with a smile.

857
01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:36,157
Showing love towards me as my wife.

858
01:24:36,262 --> 01:24:38,492
This was a fraud. Con. Deceit.

859
01:24:39,732 --> 01:24:43,429
The way she
jeopardize our love, trust..

860
01:24:43,536 --> 01:24:45,970
..if she comes before
me then l will kill her.

861
01:24:46,072 --> 01:24:50,133
Kill me. lf by killing
me your hatred decreases.

862
01:24:51,044 --> 01:24:52,306
Then kill me.

863
01:24:54,080 --> 01:24:55,240
Why have you come here?

864
01:24:55,515 --> 01:24:59,246
What do you want now?
- l want to say something to you.

865
01:24:59,552 --> 01:25:01,315
Which part of your act
is pending that you..

866
01:25:01,421 --> 01:25:04,185
..have come to show it? Go away.

867
01:25:04,457 --> 01:25:05,981
l am not the one who you think l am.

868
01:25:06,092 --> 01:25:08,083
l know very well who you are.

869
01:25:08,528 --> 01:25:11,395
You are a fraud. Con. Deceit.
- Listen.

870
01:25:11,497 --> 01:25:12,964
l don't want to hear anything.

871
01:25:13,066 --> 01:25:15,728
l don't want to see
your face. Go away.

872
01:25:16,069 --> 01:25:17,297
Get out from here.

873
01:25:21,374 --> 01:25:25,208
Deven. lt's not right
by not listening to her.

874
01:25:27,046 --> 01:25:28,707
There is another side to the coin.

875
01:25:28,982 --> 01:25:31,951
A false coin is
false on both the sides.

876
01:26:11,124 --> 01:26:13,592
Carry and take her away.

877
01:26:19,465 --> 01:26:26,132
Babu. Babu. Didn't you drink tea?
- Make one.

878
01:26:26,773 --> 01:26:30,402
Why to drink this? lt's cold.
l will prepare another one.

879
01:26:50,997 --> 01:26:54,330
Recognized.
Recognized. l recognized Dolly.

880
01:26:54,534 --> 01:26:57,025
Uncle, should l
say what is tomorrow?

881
01:26:57,303 --> 01:26:59,396
What is there tomorrow?
- Don't you remember?

882
01:26:59,639 --> 01:27:02,506
No.
- Tomorrow is my birthday.

883
01:27:02,608 --> 01:27:05,076
Alright. Very good. Very good.

884
01:27:06,446 --> 01:27:09,074
Tell me what you
want for your birthday.

885
01:27:09,182 --> 01:27:12,310
Will you get what l ask for?
- Yes. Surely.

886
01:27:12,585 --> 01:27:17,079
To play..
- Yes tell me, dear. - Get me aunt.

887
01:27:17,190 --> 01:27:19,624
She used to play many games with me.

888
01:27:21,194 --> 01:27:24,721
Yes dear. Your aunt
played many games with me too.

889
01:27:25,164 --> 01:27:29,601
l like aunt a lot.
- lf we didn't like her..

890
01:27:29,702 --> 01:27:30,999
..then why would we be sad.

891
01:27:31,637 --> 01:27:33,605
Where has aunt gone? Get her.

892
01:27:36,442 --> 01:27:39,275
How do l get her?
Where do l get her from?

893
01:27:49,155 --> 01:27:50,918
Uncle, is everything fine?

894
01:27:53,159 --> 01:27:54,319
Take this. Be happy.

895
01:28:01,467 --> 01:28:04,334
Naresh, why have you
locked me in here?

896
01:28:04,537 --> 01:28:08,735
Oh, thank god. You recognized me.

897
01:28:10,109 --> 01:28:11,701
The other day you
didn't recognize me..

898
01:28:11,978 --> 01:28:13,969
..being in love with the writer.

899
01:28:14,647 --> 01:28:16,547
And if you would act today too.

900
01:28:16,749 --> 01:28:20,446
Then surely my work would be
very difficult. - Which work?

901
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:22,678
Nothing special.

902
01:28:24,757 --> 01:28:26,622
l just want your signatures.

903
01:28:27,193 --> 01:28:32,256
Why?
- When father expired l don't know..

904
01:28:32,365 --> 01:28:35,357
..why he wrote the
property in your name.

905
01:28:36,602 --> 01:28:38,467
To improve his mistake..

906
01:28:38,638 --> 01:28:41,368
..l had to get you
to Delhi from Bombay.

907
01:28:42,942 --> 01:28:46,571
And if you still
won't heed to me then..

908
01:28:46,946 --> 01:28:48,208
There is no need to warn me.

909
01:28:48,548 --> 01:28:50,539
l am not
interested in your property.

910
01:28:50,983 --> 01:28:52,951
l can write the
property in your name.

911
01:28:53,352 --> 01:28:56,185
But l have a condition.
- What?

912
01:28:56,556 --> 01:28:58,524
After that you won't ever follow me.

913
01:29:00,126 --> 01:29:01,525
Tell me, do you agree?

914
01:29:03,329 --> 01:29:05,160
The heart says no.

915
01:29:06,299 --> 01:29:09,132
That's fine. l will
get the documents.

916
01:29:09,368 --> 01:29:12,633
Because of your shameful behavior..

917
01:29:12,738 --> 01:29:15,730
..your father has not given
you any share in his property.

918
01:29:16,175 --> 01:29:18,643
What can l do?

919
01:29:19,745 --> 01:29:23,613
Mr. Mehra, you are
our family lawyer.

920
01:29:24,016 --> 01:29:27,452
The heir to the family, that is me..

921
01:29:27,687 --> 01:29:30,053
..should be given his right.

922
01:29:30,523 --> 01:29:34,482
But l cannot cheat my
deceased friend, Daulatram.

923
01:29:36,529 --> 01:29:41,660
lf Archana is ready to
give the property to me, then?

924
01:29:41,934 --> 01:29:44,562
What do you mean?
Did you find Archana?

925
01:29:45,671 --> 01:29:49,937
Then come. Take me to her.
- Sit. Sit lawyer.

926
01:29:50,576 --> 01:29:52,635
Why do you want to meet her?

927
01:29:55,281 --> 01:29:58,580
You want her signatures.
You will get them.

928
01:29:58,684 --> 01:30:01,084
l can understand
with your talks that..

929
01:30:01,187 --> 01:30:03,553
..you want to get the
signatures forcibly.

930
01:30:04,056 --> 01:30:08,049
l am sorry to say l cannot
help you in any illegal work.

931
01:30:10,263 --> 01:30:11,992
l am so stupid.

932
01:30:13,199 --> 01:30:16,532
You make me the owner of 15 lakhs.

933
01:30:17,069 --> 01:30:19,333
And l don't take care of you.

934
01:30:21,173 --> 01:30:24,609
Will 10,000 be
sufficient for your hard work?

935
01:30:27,580 --> 01:30:31,414
lt seems your hands have
not started scratching yet.

936
01:30:32,051 --> 01:30:33,177
25,000.

937
01:30:34,420 --> 01:30:35,614
50,000.

938
01:30:36,989 --> 01:30:37,546
Done.

939
01:30:39,225 --> 01:30:41,989
You are very greedy.
- But lesser than you.

940
01:30:42,261 --> 01:30:43,489
l am sorry to say.

941
01:30:48,434 --> 01:30:49,526
That's good.

942
01:30:52,271 --> 01:30:53,260
Mr. Mehra.

943
01:30:53,673 --> 01:30:56,073
l am sorry to say Mr. Naresh.

944
01:30:56,409 --> 01:30:59,344
The scratching of my hand.
- Oh!!

945
01:31:01,180 --> 01:31:05,207
Your scratching will surely go. l..

946
01:31:05,685 --> 01:31:06,674
Where are you going?
- l will go anywhere.

947
01:31:06,953 --> 01:31:08,545
What's that to you?
- There is a reason.

948
01:31:08,654 --> 01:31:10,349
That is why l am saying.
- Naresh, leave me.

949
01:31:10,456 --> 01:31:13,721
Leave me. - Why are you forcing,
Naresh? Leave her.

950
01:31:14,160 --> 01:31:18,688
How can l leave her?
There are many things left.

951
01:31:18,965 --> 01:31:21,058
Naresh, the documents are with me.

952
01:31:21,233 --> 01:31:22,723
lf you want the
property then leave Archana.

953
01:31:27,306 --> 01:31:31,072
l am sorry. l don't
know whenever l see her.

954
01:31:31,243 --> 01:31:34,406
l go crazy. l am really very sorry.

955
01:31:35,481 --> 01:31:39,349
Lawyer, now the
property and the girl is mine.

956
01:31:39,919 --> 01:31:43,150
You can leave. Please get out.

957
01:31:43,322 --> 01:31:47,520
Mr. Naresh, l am sorry to
say these documents are fake.

958
01:31:47,627 --> 01:31:51,461
Good bye. Come dear.

959
01:31:55,167 --> 01:31:59,501
Cheater. l won't let you go.
- Hands up!

960
01:32:00,573 --> 01:32:03,667
l know how to
tackle loafers like you.

961
01:32:04,944 --> 01:32:07,412
What are you doing?
You are my partner.

962
01:32:07,513 --> 01:32:10,414
Forget 50,000 take one lakh instead.

963
01:32:10,516 --> 01:32:15,249
l am a lawyer. Not an
agent of some market.

964
01:32:15,621 --> 01:32:19,682
My profession is to give the
right to the right person.

965
01:32:20,059 --> 01:32:25,053
Not to take her rights.
l am sorry to say..

966
01:32:25,264 --> 01:32:27,459
..that these papers are real.

967
01:33:13,345 --> 01:33:14,642
Come dear. Come.

968
01:33:30,229 --> 01:33:36,168
Come, embrace me. Come,
embrace me.

969
01:33:36,669 --> 01:33:43,006
Come, embrace me. Come,
embrace me.

970
01:33:43,943 --> 01:33:50,109
Why are you shy of me?

971
01:33:51,584 --> 01:33:56,248
Why are you shy of me?

972
01:33:56,689 --> 01:34:07,122
lf you have to go. Hiding.
Then why did you hold my wrist?

973
01:34:07,433 --> 01:34:11,369
Dear, how long will
you be lost in thoughts?

974
01:34:12,671 --> 01:34:15,231
We have received a few
letters from Padma Prakashan.

975
01:34:15,674 --> 01:34:18,609
You promised them the
next book during this month.

976
01:34:19,411 --> 01:34:22,346
Why don't you complete
the incomplete novel?

977
01:34:24,049 --> 01:34:26,643
That novel will never complete.

978
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:34,153
Write to them that the
writer is dead. - Don't say that.

979
01:34:34,593 --> 01:34:36,322
Failure doesn't help.

980
01:34:38,697 --> 01:34:40,187
The hand doesn't pick up the pen.

981
01:34:41,133 --> 01:34:42,464
The mind doesn't work.

982
01:34:43,602 --> 01:34:45,092
Tell me what should l do?

983
01:34:45,304 --> 01:34:47,465
At least try. lt's
more than a month.

984
01:34:48,140 --> 01:34:51,473
lf something happens to you.
- No uncle.

985
01:34:51,577 --> 01:34:53,943
Nothing will happen to me.
l am a strong man.

986
01:34:55,114 --> 01:35:01,349
lt is my destiny to
be cheated in love.

987
01:35:05,958 --> 01:35:10,327
Deven. Deven, didn't l
tell you that girl is good?

988
01:35:10,496 --> 01:35:12,760
She is from a good family.

989
01:35:13,465 --> 01:35:15,956
Anamika's picture is
printed in this paper.

990
01:35:18,971 --> 01:35:21,735
lsn't it her? Her
real name is Archana.

991
01:35:22,575 --> 01:35:26,170
This may be her new act.
- No dear, it isn't an act.

992
01:35:26,512 --> 01:35:30,642
lt is written. Yesterday
the famous social worker..

993
01:35:31,050 --> 01:35:36,317
..Saraswati Devi was
honored after her death.

994
01:35:37,122 --> 01:35:38,555
Saraswati Devi?

995
01:35:39,491 --> 01:35:41,186
What bond she has with Anamika?

996
01:35:41,493 --> 01:35:46,055
ln this picture,
Anamika meaning Archana..

997
01:35:46,332 --> 01:35:49,529
..is receiving the award as
the daughter of Saraswati Devi.

998
01:35:53,339 --> 01:35:56,934
Uncle, if the mother was righteous.

999
01:35:57,209 --> 01:35:59,200
lt doesn't mean the
daughter is righteous too.

1000
01:36:00,145 --> 01:36:03,205
Every man coming out of a
temple isn't a disciple.

1001
01:36:03,315 --> 01:36:07,308
But dear. Every man
coming out of a wine shop..

1002
01:36:07,419 --> 01:36:11,185
..isn't an alcoholic.
- But his name is spoilt.

1003
01:36:11,423 --> 01:36:14,756
That is what l am say every
blamed person is a disciple.

1004
01:36:15,561 --> 01:36:18,291
The girl was blamed.
Without finding out.

1005
01:36:18,397 --> 01:36:22,493
You thought she was bad. She
came to you with an explanation.

1006
01:36:22,601 --> 01:36:25,069
You threw her out of the house.

1007
01:36:28,307 --> 01:36:30,468
lf you won't go to Delhi
to find out the truth..

1008
01:36:30,576 --> 01:36:32,203
..then l will go.

1009
01:36:36,215 --> 01:36:38,183
lf you go it will be better.

1010
01:36:38,684 --> 01:36:41,710
Tomorrow is the
silver jubilee function..

1011
01:36:42,054 --> 01:36:43,612
..of Padma Prakashan. We
have received the invitation.

1012
01:36:43,722 --> 01:36:46,190
There was a call from Delhi too.

1013
01:36:50,996 --> 01:36:52,020
Alright.

1014
01:37:18,257 --> 01:37:21,124
Listen, why is the
office of Mahila Samaj shut?

1015
01:37:21,493 --> 01:37:24,985
The secretary has died.
- Oh, when will it open?

1016
01:37:25,097 --> 01:37:26,291
Tomorrow.

1017
01:37:35,941 --> 01:37:38,569
Hey, Mr. Devendra. You?
- Hello. - Hello. Hello.

1018
01:37:38,677 --> 01:37:42,704
Our eyes got tired waiting
for you. We had lost hope.

1019
01:37:42,982 --> 01:37:46,418
Come. Welcome.
- Hey. - Hey, one moment.

1020
01:37:47,152 --> 01:37:49,677
Devendra.
- Yes. Mr. Dutt. Hello.

1021
01:37:49,955 --> 01:37:52,981
Hello. - How are you? - l
am alive because of this.

1022
01:37:53,325 --> 01:37:58,228
lt is rightly said. lf we
had insulted our sorrow.

1023
01:37:58,630 --> 01:38:01,724
lf there was no
alcohol we would have died.

1024
01:38:03,502 --> 01:38:06,403
Take. Have a drink.
- Oh no. Thank you, Mr. Dutt.

1025
01:38:06,505 --> 01:38:09,599
l am enjoying life without drinking.

1026
01:38:10,042 --> 01:38:13,068
Yes. The intoxication of
having money and fame.

1027
01:38:13,312 --> 01:38:16,406
lsn't there in this.
- Come Mr. Devendra. - Hello.

1028
01:38:16,515 --> 01:38:19,951
Hello. - l was saying a
phrase of Sahil Velvi.

1029
01:38:20,185 --> 01:38:27,057
Go ahead. - When l sigh.
When l sigh. She perspires.

1030
01:38:27,159 --> 01:38:30,253
When l say no. She
gets scared at night.

1031
01:38:30,362 --> 01:38:32,421
Wow!
- Good.

1032
01:38:37,369 --> 01:38:39,564
What will you say? Go away.

1033
01:38:43,142 --> 01:38:46,339
Oh yes. Deven. You
have written a song..

1034
01:38:46,445 --> 01:38:49,539
..in your new novel, Anamika.
- Yes.

1035
01:38:50,082 --> 01:38:53,347
Something wet lashes.
- lt is like this.

1036
01:38:53,619 --> 01:38:58,579
On my wet lashes. My
dreams are shattered.

1037
01:38:59,024 --> 01:39:02,425
You are waiting for someone.
Anamika..

1038
01:39:08,500 --> 01:39:12,994
One moment. Anamika. Anamika.

1039
01:39:14,706 --> 01:39:18,665
Did you tell me something?
- You don't recognize me now.

1040
01:39:19,378 --> 01:39:25,317
Have we met before?
- How long will you keep acting?

1041
01:39:25,617 --> 01:39:28,051
Do you know l have come
to Delhi to search you?

1042
01:39:28,487 --> 01:39:33,424
You are mistaken. My name
isn't Anamika. lt's Mrs. Kashap.

1043
01:39:33,659 --> 01:39:38,892
Mrs. Kashap? Why are
you trying to cheat me?

1044
01:39:39,298 --> 01:39:42,631
Why are you troubling me? l know..
- Mr. Sharma.

1045
01:39:46,238 --> 01:39:50,470
Yes. - You? - Don't you
know him? He is Devendra.

1046
01:39:50,576 --> 01:39:53,409
Alright.
- Mr. Devendra, she is Mrs. Kashap.

1047
01:39:54,279 --> 01:39:56,110
The new owner of Padma Prakashan.

1048
01:39:56,215 --> 01:39:57,614
Pleased to meet you.

1049
01:39:58,250 --> 01:40:01,117
Mr. Deven, your
novels name is Anamika.

1050
01:40:01,453 --> 01:40:04,445
ls it some one's name?
- Yes.

1051
01:40:05,924 --> 01:40:09,291
She looks innocent like
the heroine of my novel.

1052
01:40:09,528 --> 01:40:11,462
But in reality she is
a cheater and a fraud.

1053
01:40:11,563 --> 01:40:15,226
By speaking of someone's
fraud why do you spoil our mood?

1054
01:40:15,334 --> 01:40:17,302
What happened to the
song that you were saying?

1055
01:40:17,970 --> 01:40:20,234
l am sorry Mr. Dutt.
- What are you saying?

1056
01:40:20,339 --> 01:40:22,933
Did you refuse to
give the royalty cheque?

1057
01:40:23,175 --> 01:40:25,336
No. l..
- Then please request him.

1058
01:40:25,444 --> 01:40:28,379
Mr. Deven, when everyone is
asking for it, then please go ahead.

1059
01:40:28,647 --> 01:40:30,547
We will also get a
chance to hear your song.

1060
01:40:30,649 --> 01:40:32,446
Yes Mr. Devendra, please!

1061
01:40:32,951 --> 01:40:38,116
Friends. Friends, our
friend Mr. Devendra Dutt..

1062
01:40:38,223 --> 01:40:41,090
..will present a song.

1063
01:41:03,215 --> 01:41:11,589
On my wet lashes. My
dreams are shattered.

1064
01:41:12,224 --> 01:41:16,923
Your heart is pained too.

1065
01:41:17,029 --> 01:41:21,193
Anamika, you are
waiting for someone.

1066
01:41:21,400 --> 01:41:24,369
On my wet lashes.

1067
01:41:26,004 --> 01:41:34,412
On my wet lashes. My
dreams are shattered.

1068
01:41:34,947 --> 01:41:37,279
Your heart is pained too.

1069
01:41:37,382 --> 01:41:43,548
Anamika, you are
waiting for someone.

1070
01:41:43,922 --> 01:41:47,016
On my wet lashes.

1071
01:42:13,218 --> 01:42:20,283
Without knowing you.
Without recognizing you.

1072
01:42:22,094 --> 01:42:26,428
l embraced you.

1073
01:42:26,665 --> 01:42:31,034
Without knowing you.
Without recognizing you.

1074
01:42:31,136 --> 01:42:35,197
l embraced you.

1075
01:42:35,507 --> 01:42:44,381
But in return for my love,
you showed me this day.

1076
01:42:44,650 --> 01:42:52,682
The way l spend my
days in waiting. Pinning.

1077
01:42:53,325 --> 01:42:55,953
Your heart is pained too.

1078
01:42:56,061 --> 01:43:02,057
Anamika, you are
waiting for someone.

1079
01:43:02,334 --> 01:43:05,667
On my wet lashes.

1080
01:43:22,554 --> 01:43:29,687
A bond with fire. A
relationship with a woman.

1081
01:43:31,396 --> 01:43:35,696
Why didn't l understand?

1082
01:43:36,134 --> 01:43:40,434
A bond with fire. A
relationship with a woman.

1083
01:43:40,539 --> 01:43:44,566
Why didn't l understand?

1084
01:43:44,976 --> 01:43:47,240
What had happened to me?

1085
01:43:47,346 --> 01:43:53,012
Why did l fall in
love with a cheater?

1086
01:43:53,952 --> 01:44:01,324
The whole world laughs at
your cheating everywhere l pass.

1087
01:44:02,661 --> 01:44:05,425
Your heart is pained too.

1088
01:44:05,530 --> 01:44:10,763
Anamika, you are
waiting for someone.

1089
01:44:11,336 --> 01:44:14,533
On my wet lashes.

1090
01:44:16,007 --> 01:44:24,540
On my wet lashes. My
dreams are shattered.

1091
01:44:24,783 --> 01:44:27,343
Your heart is pained too.

1092
01:44:27,452 --> 01:44:33,413
Anamika, you are
waiting for someone.

1093
01:44:33,725 --> 01:44:37,320
On my wet lashes.

1094
01:45:25,377 --> 01:45:27,072
Anamika.

1095
01:45:30,382 --> 01:45:31,974
l have come to question you.

1096
01:45:32,284 --> 01:45:34,275
lt's useless asking now.

1097
01:45:37,255 --> 01:45:42,283
l just want to say that
whatever you have heard of me.

1098
01:45:44,095 --> 01:45:49,931
That is true. But whatever
you have understood is wrong.

1099
01:45:50,035 --> 01:45:53,937
Don't puzzle me. lf you
have any rights on my love..

1100
01:45:54,039 --> 01:45:58,135
Right? Men have kept
the rights on their side.

1101
01:45:58,510 --> 01:46:00,637
And left
helplessness with the women.

1102
01:46:01,346 --> 01:46:03,371
One girl in life cheated you..

1103
01:46:03,682 --> 01:46:06,708
..so you got the
right to hate all women.

1104
01:46:08,520 --> 01:46:12,650
You don't know, Anamika.
Your different images.

1105
01:46:13,258 --> 01:46:16,625
Your different names.
They are eating my brains.

1106
01:46:18,663 --> 01:46:21,154
Tell me openly what
your real image is.

1107
01:46:23,201 --> 01:46:25,465
On the real image of Anamika..

1108
01:46:26,171 --> 01:46:28,605
..there is lot of blame attached.

1109
01:46:29,708 --> 01:46:33,041
She is not liable to be a
creation of a great writer like you.

1110
01:46:34,479 --> 01:46:39,974
Forget that story. Tear
every page. Each word.

1111
01:46:41,086 --> 01:46:44,613
So that even her shadow
shouldn't befall on you.

1112
01:46:50,228 --> 01:46:55,461
l have lost myself in the
memories of your thoughts.

1113
01:46:56,301 --> 01:46:58,462
l cannot see
anything in this darkness.

1114
01:46:59,271 --> 01:47:00,533
l don't understand anything.

1115
01:47:01,540 --> 01:47:03,303
Somewhere you are Kanchan.

1116
01:47:03,542 --> 01:47:06,170
Somewhere Archana.
Somewhere Dhamyanti.

1117
01:47:07,212 --> 01:47:08,543
Somewhere Mrs. Kashyap.

1118
01:47:10,415 --> 01:47:13,009
ln these names where
did you lose my Anamika?

1119
01:47:16,187 --> 01:47:19,054
For god's sake tell me what
the truth is. What is a lie?

1120
01:47:20,425 --> 01:47:26,455
Alright. lf you want to
know my past. Then listen.

1121
01:47:26,998 --> 01:47:30,058
My connection with you
started when l took..

1122
01:47:30,368 --> 01:47:34,600
..a novel, Jeevan ek kahani
from the college library to read.

1123
01:47:36,007 --> 01:47:37,998
As l started reading the novel.

1124
01:47:38,610 --> 01:47:41,010
Without knowing l
fell in love with you.

1125
01:47:41,379 --> 01:47:46,316
And you became the first joy,
hope and love of my life.

1126
01:47:47,986 --> 01:47:49,453
Day in and out l
used to dream about you.

1127
01:47:49,721 --> 01:47:52,246
Your thoughts. Your books.

1128
01:47:54,960 --> 01:47:56,928
Naresh and l studied
in the same college.

1129
01:47:57,028 --> 01:47:59,462
He always said that
he liked me a lot.

1130
01:47:59,564 --> 01:48:02,362
He used to often tease me.

1131
01:48:07,038 --> 01:48:09,063
Naresh troubled me in the college.

1132
01:48:09,374 --> 01:48:10,739
And mother's health
troubled me at home.

1133
01:48:11,476 --> 01:48:13,501
One day when l reached home.
Mother told me.

1134
01:48:13,712 --> 01:48:16,704
Dr. Kapoor had sent
me to Patel institute.

1135
01:48:17,215 --> 01:48:21,618
To get the report.
- What does it say? - Cancer.

1136
01:48:24,222 --> 01:48:27,453
Bitto, if l die.

1137
01:48:29,027 --> 01:48:31,962
My soul will not rest in
peace thinking about you.

1138
01:48:35,300 --> 01:48:41,136
Agree to me. l have
searched a good boy for you.

1139
01:48:42,240 --> 01:48:44,299
He will keep you happy
throughout your life.

1140
01:48:46,211 --> 01:48:50,204
l will die peacefully
once you get married.

1141
01:49:02,727 --> 01:49:08,461
God poked fun at me.
The one l dreamt of.

1142
01:49:09,467 --> 01:49:11,128
He was standing in front of me.

1143
01:49:11,503 --> 01:49:15,098
But l was getting
married to someone else.

1144
01:49:18,643 --> 01:49:22,272
My first night was strange.
lt was midnight.

1145
01:49:22,514 --> 01:49:24,448
The groom was nowhere around.

1146
01:49:24,549 --> 01:49:28,212
Everyone was tensed.
People went in search for him.

1147
01:49:28,687 --> 01:49:31,053
But there was no
news about my husband.

1148
01:49:35,193 --> 01:49:37,889
You?
- The groom hasn't come yet.

1149
01:49:37,996 --> 01:49:39,987
l thought let me
have fun for sometime.

1150
01:49:40,098 --> 01:49:43,033
Naresh?
- lf this was my first night.

1151
01:49:44,069 --> 01:49:48,665
l will yell. - Think twice.
l am your brother in law.

1152
01:49:50,375 --> 01:49:54,471
Brother in law?
- Give. Give me my right.

1153
01:49:57,148 --> 01:50:02,677
Naresh. Naresh.
- Anyways, what's the hurry?

1154
01:50:03,621 --> 01:50:06,647
Now god has sent you to me.

1155
01:50:11,696 --> 01:50:13,129
A week passed.

1156
01:50:13,565 --> 01:50:15,624
Still my husband's
whereabouts were not known.

1157
01:50:19,504 --> 01:50:22,667
Archana, you are mine forever.

1158
01:50:23,408 --> 01:50:25,603
Aren't you ashamed to speak thus?

1159
01:50:26,211 --> 01:50:30,272
lf your brother comes, then?
- Hey. He will never return.

1160
01:50:30,381 --> 01:50:33,077
What nonsense?
- He surely became a husband.

1161
01:50:33,585 --> 01:50:36,213
But he couldn't fulfill
his duty as a husband.

1162
01:50:37,222 --> 01:50:41,022
Now, l am your brother
in law and your husband.

1163
01:50:41,126 --> 01:50:44,220
Leave me. Leave.
- This wrist full of bangles is..

1164
01:50:44,329 --> 01:50:46,889
..for married ladies not widows.

1165
01:50:47,098 --> 01:50:50,158
Naresh.
- Yes. You are a widow. Widow.

1166
01:50:50,401 --> 01:50:54,895
Naresh. Father.
- What is this?

1167
01:50:55,006 --> 01:50:57,236
Father, she is an unlucky woman.

1168
01:50:57,475 --> 01:50:59,670
As she entered the house,
she brought ill fortune to us.

1169
01:51:00,512 --> 01:51:02,537
Look. Read this letter.

1170
01:51:04,682 --> 01:51:06,274
Brother committed suicide.

1171
01:51:09,087 --> 01:51:12,454
l was not liable for marriage.
Still l got married.

1172
01:51:13,024 --> 01:51:15,458
lnstead of dying
daily it will be better.

1173
01:51:15,660 --> 01:51:18,185
No one should be
blamed for my death.

1174
01:51:21,466 --> 01:51:23,661
That shock
paralyzed my father in law.

1175
01:51:24,435 --> 01:51:27,529
He was not able to go anywhere.

1176
01:51:27,939 --> 01:51:30,271
Daughter in law, there was
a call from the hospital.

1177
01:51:30,375 --> 01:51:32,502
Your mother's condition is
critical. You are called there.

1178
01:51:37,015 --> 01:51:39,677
When l went to the
hospital mother was unconscious.

1179
01:51:40,919 --> 01:51:44,082
After that she never
came to consciousness.

1180
01:51:48,393 --> 01:51:52,295
As father in law was paralyzed.
Naresh got bolder.

1181
01:52:20,358 --> 01:52:21,950
Frightened by Naresh..

1182
01:52:22,293 --> 01:52:25,126
..l not only left this
house but the city of Delhi.

1183
01:52:25,730 --> 01:52:31,293
l went to Bombay. l met Ruby
meaning Rubia in the train.

1184
01:52:32,337 --> 01:52:34,100
She was sympathic with me.

1185
01:52:34,439 --> 01:52:36,566
Gave me a job at Mr.
Malhotra's office.

1186
01:52:38,009 --> 01:52:39,943
l told him my name was Kanchan.

1187
01:52:40,478 --> 01:52:42,343
So that l start a new life.

1188
01:52:43,448 --> 01:52:46,349
After working for a month,
Mr. Malhotra took me..

1189
01:52:46,451 --> 01:52:51,514
..to Shimla for modeling.
We worked the whole day.

1190
01:52:51,990 --> 01:52:55,619
But that night.. Mr.

l left from Shimla that night.

1196
01:53:30,461 --> 01:53:33,328
When l came back to Bombay
and told Rubia everything.

1197
01:53:33,498 --> 01:53:36,331
l didn't know that
he is such a crook.

1198
01:53:37,101 --> 01:53:39,160
Anyway, where are you staying?

1199
01:53:39,370 --> 01:53:41,634
My luggage is at the
station right now. - Station?

1200
01:53:42,240 --> 01:53:46,336
Why at the station? Come with me.

1201
01:53:46,511 --> 01:53:50,641
l will place you in a hostel.
Where some working girls live.

1202
01:53:50,748 --> 01:53:52,079
Come, my dear.

1203
01:53:53,418 --> 01:53:56,080
She is Lily. Commercial artist.
- Hi!

1204
01:54:00,525 --> 01:54:02,425
Oh! She is Rosita.

1205
01:54:03,761 --> 01:54:06,286
Hi!
- And she is Rita.

1206
01:54:06,497 --> 01:54:08,431
She is a model.
- Hello!

1207
01:54:09,467 --> 01:54:11,526
Girls, she is Kanchan.

1208
01:54:12,003 --> 01:54:13,470
She will live with you from now on.

1209
01:54:14,105 --> 01:54:18,371
Rita, take her to
your room. Go my dear.

1210
01:54:20,645 --> 01:54:22,169
What kind of
working girls are these?

1211
01:54:22,447 --> 01:54:24,381
They are not shy. Timid.

1212
01:54:25,516 --> 01:54:30,146
l came to know very soon.
- C'mon, run. Run.

1213
01:54:30,254 --> 01:54:31,448
lt's a police raid. Run.
- Stop! Don't try to run.

1214
01:54:32,223 --> 01:54:37,217
Come. You too come.

1215
01:54:38,062 --> 01:54:39,689
Me?
- Yes, you.

1216
01:54:40,264 --> 01:54:44,963
Where?
- Police station. C'mon. Get up.

1217
01:54:47,171 --> 01:54:50,072
l was arrested along
with the prostitute..

1218
01:54:50,174 --> 01:54:51,368
..even though l was innocent.

1219
01:54:52,643 --> 01:54:56,443
The next day all the girls
spoke for me in the court.

1220
01:54:57,415 --> 01:55:00,248
The magistrate left
me as l was innocent.

1221
01:55:01,152 --> 01:55:03,484
But who pushed you out of
the running car that night?

1222
01:55:04,288 --> 01:55:07,416
My statements were
against Ruby at the court.

1223
01:55:08,326 --> 01:55:10,294
Due to which she was
under the scanner of law.

1224
01:55:11,295 --> 01:55:13,320
Maybe she wanted to
take revenge for it.

1225
01:55:14,232 --> 01:55:15,597
Those two crooks were her men.

1226
01:55:16,501 --> 01:55:18,093
They picked me up
from the road and..

1227
01:55:18,269 --> 01:55:19,566
..were taking me somewhere forcibly.

1228
01:55:21,205 --> 01:55:26,199
To save myself l jumped off
the car. And fell unconscious.

1229
01:55:27,578 --> 01:55:30,138
How did you think
of becoming my wife?

1230
01:55:30,248 --> 01:55:33,684
The next morning when l
awoke l was surprised.

1231
01:55:34,385 --> 01:55:38,515
Where did l come? But l
saw you sleeping in a room.

1232
01:55:39,123 --> 01:55:41,557
l thought l got everything in life.

1233
01:55:42,994 --> 01:55:48,193
l decided. Whatever it may be
l will not leave this house.

1234
01:55:50,268 --> 01:55:52,099
Whether you believe it or not.

1235
01:55:53,004 --> 01:55:55,973
l have told you all the
incidents of my past life.

1236
01:55:57,341 --> 01:56:02,506
But l have no proof to prove it.

1237
01:56:27,705 --> 01:56:29,138
Won't you forgive me?

1238
01:56:50,995 --> 01:56:53,020
Who are you?
- l am Naresh.

1239
01:56:53,231 --> 01:56:55,256
Naresh, you are alive?
- Absolutely.

1240
01:56:55,466 --> 01:56:58,026
How could l die
without fulfilling my wish?

1241
01:57:03,474 --> 01:57:06,170
Naresh.
- Get out!

1242
01:57:33,938 --> 01:57:35,462
ls there some other way to go out?

1243
01:59:16,440 --> 01:59:19,136
Hello. Hello. Police station.

1244
01:59:21,178 --> 01:59:22,702
Hello. Hello.

1245
01:59:24,148 --> 01:59:25,513
Hello. Hello. Police station.

1246
02:02:20,224 --> 02:02:22,385
Deven, enough of this hide and seek.

1247
02:02:23,561 --> 02:02:27,395
But don't be scared. l
don't have any enmity with you.

1248
02:02:28,933 --> 02:02:31,163
l can still let you go alive.

1249
02:02:31,502 --> 02:02:33,402
But the condition is that..

1250
02:02:33,504 --> 02:02:35,904
..you call out to that girl
and tell her to come here.

1251
02:02:36,607 --> 02:02:38,165
Call out. Deven,

1252
02:02:40,678 --> 02:02:42,236
Call out. Deven.

1253
02:02:44,248 --> 02:02:47,115
l am telling you to
call out to her.

1254
02:04:04,328 --> 02:04:10,324
Come embrace me.

1255
02:04:11,769 --> 02:04:17,298
Why are you shy of me?

1256
02:04:17,541 --> 02:04:22,604
Why are you shy of me?
