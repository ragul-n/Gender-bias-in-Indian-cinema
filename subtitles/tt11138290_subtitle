1
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:23,040
In 1995, a gang war broke
out in Poonamallee, Chennai

2
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,320
Dayalan, who ruled over that
place for long was the target

3
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,400
Many tried to finish him
off and take his place

4
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,280
But none of them could even near Dayalan

5
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,000
The reason? His friends; his sidekicks

6
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,800
Dilli Babu and Sakkara Das

7
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,560
When the gang war ended Dayalan
proved that he is king of Poonamallee

8
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:46,320
To celebrate that victory, he arranged
a party and invited every gangsters

9
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,840
During that party, when Dilli
committed a silly mistake

10
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,560
Dayalan embarrassed him in
front of the whole crowd

11
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,400
Everyone laughed at Dilli

12
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,440
Dilli snapped and couldn't
control his anger

13
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,680
He took out a knife and
stabbed Dayalan on the spot!

14
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:02,120
Everyone, who were laughing,
were taken aback!

15
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,680
This news spread like a wildfire
everywhere on the same night

16
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:10,080
At sunrise Poonamallee had a
new king and it was Dillibabu

17
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,800
Instead being a friend to Dilli,
Sakkara Das wanted to become the king

18
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,480
And so he planned to finish off Dilli

19
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,120
Today, even after 25 years and many
attempts still Dilli was unstoppable

20
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,000
Dilli helped those in power by
committing murders for them

21
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,840
He became even more powerful

22
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,600
- Long live! Long live!
- Minister Thangadurai!

23
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:38,800
- Long live! Long live!
- Minister Thangadurai!

24
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,400
Dilli...

25
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,160
here's the details of a person

26
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,800
Snatch our hard disk
that he possess

27
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,440
I'll collect it from
you when I find time

28
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,480
Until then you have it

29
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,720
Now that you've handed the
task over to me., don't worry

30
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,320
That hard disk is very important

31
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,320
If data in it leaks, it'll
topple our government

32
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,440
So you mean the government is
now at the behest of me, Dilli?

33
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,720
Our plight!

34
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,600
After Paul Raj, Sakkara predicted that
he would Dilli Babu's next target

35
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,320
So he started making plans
in order to over take Dilli

36
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,000
Soon we must print a obituary
poster like this for Dilli

37
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,680
We must finish him off

38
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,320
Wait

39
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,240
Whom will you hire to finish him?

40
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,880
Say he is the target and it'll scare
the bejesus out of every hitman!

41
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,200
We shouldn't do it

42
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,760
But we must get it done

43
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,160
One who finishes him off...

44
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,880
must be a guy who is always around us

45
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,760
But...

46
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,600
someone who doesn't know about Dilli

47
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:50,360
So to put an end to this game of cards
filled with Jacks, Kings and Aces...

48
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,360
came along a Joker!

49
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:19,000
(Supernatural Human Beings)

50
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,480
Greetings and a very
warm welcome to the show...

51
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,200
Supernatural Human Beings

52
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,560
Liew Thow Lin from Malaysia...

53
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,680
had magnetic qualities in his body

54
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,800
Michel Lotito from France...

55
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,200
ate a whole aeroplane by biting
and chewing it with his teeth

56
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,080
Natasha Demkina from Russia...

57
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,200
could take X- rays
using her naked eyes

58
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,200
In fact...

59
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,680
Raj Mohan Nair from our country...

60
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:55,880
generated electricity from his
body and lighted up a bulb!

61
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,320
So many such Supernatural humans
live in this world of ours

62
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,360
Based on that, people with unique qualities
and super natural powers from our place...

63
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,200
are the ones we will be
meeting in this show!

64
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,840
I am very curious to know about your son

65
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,440
Tell us about him

66
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,000
My son is a very soft person, madam

67
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,400
How do I put it...He is very emotional type

68
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,760
Even if his favorite star
gets beaten up in a movie...

69
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,080
Dad!

70
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,560
Dear, what happened? Why are you crying?

71
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:29,200
Asin died without finding out the
fact that Surya is Sanjay Ramasamy!

72
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,680
It's a movie! Asin would have
gone home after the shooting

73
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,680
Tell him dear wifey!

74
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,520
Especially when it
comes to friendship...

75
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,920
Friends are his life!

76
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,840
He will do anything for his friends

77
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,800
I'm Thiyagu from Mahalakshmi, Poonamallee

78
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,040
Myself, Gandhi, Mani...

79
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,240
and Dillibabu! We all
are childhood friends

80
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,920
Gandhi will rush to help anyone
and everyone who needs help

81
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,360
You played with us and now you're busted!
Embarrassed?

82
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,800
- Shut up! We just dated, right?
- Of course!

83
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,640
Then stop showing off as I cheated
you after we got married!

84
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,800
One punch and....Stop talking
as if you're innocent!

85
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,640
Oh my God! My stomach hurts!

86
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,800
Sister, do you feel feverish?

87
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,760
- Come on! I am here to help you, sister
- Dude, she is acting!

88
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,920
- Will he come back?
- Who's that emotional fellow?

89
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,560
- I'll take care of you
- It's ok, brother!

90
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,440
Money...here take it. Here!

91
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,560
In the name of solving one issue
he'll tag us to another big one

92
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,400
She cheated me for 4 years
and him for 2 years

93
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,000
We just busted her, caught her
and your friend spoiled it!

94
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,200
Is he your friend?

95
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,640
Worst!

96
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:31,680
Gandhi would the first person to help
anyone in the office,who calls out for help

97
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,360
In these modern days when people
hardly do their own work...

98
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,440
He helps other and does their job too

99
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,920
Wondering that all that we
heard so far was just normal?

100
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,080
Wondering what's so
supernatural about it?

101
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:51,320
The supernatural qualities
of our guest today...

102
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,800
Let's find it out from him

103
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,160
Sounds interesting, isn't it?

104
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,680
Let's welcome Gandhi on our show, today

105
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,040
Come on, let's clap everybody!

106
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,080
Hi

107
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,160
Greetings. Please have a seat

108
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,680
Greetings

109
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,920
So Gandhi...

110
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,480
before this supernatural
quality found you...

111
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,000
what was the biggest
issue in your life?

112
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,640
Of course it was my love life!

113
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:22,480
Just like everyone else, I was an
engineering graduate who worked in I.T

114
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,120
So, in the HR department of our office...

115
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,800
there was this girl named Ankita!

116
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,600
Her eyes...

117
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:44,040
"Your eyes and the way its speak, makes
you look like an angel on earth"

118
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:49,120
"So baby, allow me and I will
follow you back and forth"

119
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:54,640
"Apple like cheeks that shine so bright"

120
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,480
"Smile so cute! Oh my, what a sight"

121
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:07,120
"Mesmerizing voice that attracts me!
I tell myself 'Stop being so crazy'!"

122
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,040
"A queen on the golden chariot"

123
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,760
"She lights up my whole world"

124
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,920
"A flower must have scent and a
gentleman should have good qualities'

125
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:00,560
"So be the daughter of such a
gentleman and have a good reputation"

126
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,200
Everyone's watching!

127
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,440
Can you or can you not?

128
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,200
You! Look at her!

129
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:14,720
Like a pot head hit a jackpot!
Look how beautiful she is

130
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,600
She is way out of you league! Just do it!

131
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,240
But if people find out...

132
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,840
Well, then it'd be a proud
moment for the 90s kids!

133
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,440
Just do it! Do it!

134
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,880
I did it

135
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,720
I love you

136
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,120
"You smile is never a lie and
whatever you say is just fine"

137
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,720
"You are my love life
and soon to be my wife"

138
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,360
"A thousand of butterflies in my
stomach and they make me fly high"

139
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,720
"Blindly in love, I'm hypnotised"

140
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,440
"I follow you everywhere you go"

141
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,080
"All I want is you and that is all I know"

142
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,520
"I will do just about
anything for you"

143
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,680
"Love is beyond science and a
feeling that is always new"

144
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,200
"She is a sweetheart"

145
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,800
"The girl who stole my heart"

146
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,200
"Let me hold your hand"

147
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,000
"And live forever in our love land"

148
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:11,320
"I follow you everywhere you go"

149
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:15,920
"I will gift myself to you"

150
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,040
"A queen on the golden chariot"

151
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,160
"She lights up my whole world"

152
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,440
What are you telling, Ankita?

153
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,120
We have already fixed a groom for you

154
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,240
- Well...
- You know about our financial status!

155
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,760
There is a lot of difference
between his and our family!

156
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,560
Game over?

157
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,040
Please dad!

158
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,680
You have a good job

159
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,000
That is the sole reason I'm considering you

160
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,200
If not for that job I'd have
asked to you forget Ankita

161
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,480
I'll talk to your parents someday

162
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,160
Let's see if things can work out

163
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,480
Guys...

164
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,640
We are happy to inaugurate
our soft skills program...

165
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,880
in front of our executive
officer, Mr. Peter Wilson

166
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:20,840
In this soft skill program,
learning Hindi is mandatory

167
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,080
What? Why are they imposing it on us?

168
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,000
Everyone must attend this class
for an hour after your work hours

169
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,600
Don't you always talk like a rebel. Here
is another chance, speak up and save us!

170
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,600
Why would I knowingly invite trouble?

171
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,320
Whom can I tag instead of me?

172
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,880
I know one guy

173
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,360
He is a specialist!

174
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,440
He will rock it!

175
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,520
Here he is!

176
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,760
Here comes my slave!

177
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,320
Welcome my braveheart!

178
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,080
Hi

179
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,560
Sorry, I'm a bit late

180
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,480
That's ok

181
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:54,160
At the right time you will
reach the right place!

182
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,320
Which I.T company forces their
employees to learn Hindi?

183
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,200
But our company is making us do it

184
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,680
Look what the society says...

185
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,280
'Hear you inner voice? Raise you voice!'

186
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,840
- Protest against injustice!
- No, please. No

187
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,680
- No! No! Sir!
- Get up!

188
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,560
Uh-oh! I'm trapped!

189
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,000
Yes Gandhi?

190
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,600
Sir...

191
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,920
why do we have to impose anything sir?

192
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,800
Let people learn what they want to learn

193
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,520
Wow! Wow!

194
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,160
Excuse me! My training!

195
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,320
Mr Gandhi...

196
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,040
we have our branches in
Delhi and Mumbai as well

197
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,360
Sir but our clients are in
New York and New Jersey!

198
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,000
Nailed it! Nailed it! You rock, buddy!

199
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:32,880
You!

200
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,360
Gandhi, have a seat.
First, have a seat

201
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,920
Give him some water

202
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,560
I have one more point to make

203
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,720
Sir, it seems he has one more point to make

204
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,880
Make!

205
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,760
- Sir, I come to conclusion
- Conclusion!

206
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,600
Stupid!

207
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:50,400
Instead of learning 1 regional
language from 5:30 to 6:30...

208
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,320
we can actually learn 2 programming
languages from 5:30 to 7:30!

209
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,880
It'll actually be helpful, sir

210
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,520
Sit down!

211
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,840
He makes sense

212
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,320
Yes

213
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,880
Ankita...

214
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,360
please email me Gandhi's profile

215
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,560
Err.. Ok, Patel

216
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,160
Sir, he's innocent. He's
a very good resource

217
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,240
- Do what I say
- Yes, sir

218
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,000
This one?

219
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,840
- It's quiet simple
- Then you do it

220
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,320
Ok

221
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,000
Can't you just keep your mouth shut?

222
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,200
What happened, Ankita?

223
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,360
Morning, I was asked to email your profile

224
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,200
Manager wants to meet you

225
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,000
Now, go!

226
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,760
I'm nervous, Ankita

227
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,560
Weren't you nervous to play
a rebel on other's orders?

228
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,760
Girlfriend - A dangerous species!

229
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,560
Ok! Stop making that sad face

230
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,520
Now go with this smiling face
and meet the manager. Ok?

231
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,280
Won't be that bad. Ok?

232
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,000
My profile is that bad!

233
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,040
All the best

234
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:54,520
We are screening few employees this year

235
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:59,440
Since you haven't completed your
degree, your name has come up

236
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,600
Isn't the exams to clear
you backlogs coming up?

237
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,880
Clear off your backlogs

238
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,280
You should've cleared them during training
period. How could you be so careless, Gandhi?

239
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,400
Why are you quiet?

240
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,600
My exam is tomorrow, Ankita

241
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,120
What?

242
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:19,440
Fine...

243
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,000
go home and start preparing right away. Ok?

244
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,920
I just can't imagine
a future without you

245
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,800
What if you screw up in this exam?

246
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,080
Then things will go out
of my control, Gandhi

247
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,360
Really?

248
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:40,400
So call me and tell that you
did this exam well. Ok?

249
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,240
I'll be waiting for your call

250
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:42,880
Ok?

251
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:43,720
Come on

252
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,600
So which subject do you have a backlog in?

253
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,200
DSP - Digital Signal Processing
alias Degree Stopping Paper!

254
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,480
5 units in total

255
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,440
Definitely the exam paper will have 2 2marks
and 1 16 mark question from each unit

256
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,920
It's be enough if I cover these topics...

257
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,280
I can score minimum 80
marks and rock this exam!

258
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:12,360
It's a simple exam. Why
strain yourself so much?

259
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,840
Simple exam? How can you
be so cool about it?

260
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,240
It's an Engineering exam!

261
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,160
Right from childhood the word 'exam'
sends a shiver down my spine!

262
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,040
I haven't even covered
the 1st unit, oh God!

263
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Mr. Manoj!

264
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,720
- Hello
- Hello, Mr. Gandhi...

265
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,160
- What?
- Indeed! So many mistakes!

266
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,000
That pot head Patel ripped me apart!

267
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,920
He asked me if I was really a software
engineer or a server in Saravana Bhavan!

268
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,000
- Wait, I'll call you later
- Before that please place your order!

269
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,120
Hello, Anki...

270
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,560
So, this is how you study for exam?

271
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,440
Whom were talking to?

272
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,040
My friend called me up

273
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,880
So, I don't matter to you?

274
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,840
Come on, baby. Nothing of that sort...

275
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,360
Gandhi, you don't seem to be serious.
You're still playful!

276
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,440
What's more important
than preparing for exam?

277
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,320
If you lose your job, how
will we run a family?

278
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,400
Already my family has a debt of 5 million!

279
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,680
We are pushed to sell our
land and clear the debt

280
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,080
If you don't get your degree,
they won't agree for our marriage

281
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,080
Did I say anything wrong?

282
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,520
No, Anki...

283
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,360
Fine. Don't break your head over
all these and focus on studying

284
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,840
We'll talk later

285
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,040
Bye

286
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,520
Don't break my head and study?

287
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,400
How can I study after hearing all that?

288
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,080
The time is just 10 'O clock...

289
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,520
So, I shall finish studying
the 2nd unit in 2 hours

290
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,680
Attend 3 16 marks question and...

291
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:37,440
Ok!

292
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,040
Ok, worst come I can at least pass

293
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,160
Let's do this!

294
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,440
Why? Why!

295
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,160
Mom...

296
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,920
I have got an exam tomorrow morning.
I've set the alarm

297
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,240
I must wake up at 6

298
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,280
- If I don't wake up, please wake me up
- Ok

299
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,200
I'll wake you

300
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,880
- Dear, it's me, the shop owner. Please, wake up
- Come on, who's troubling me so early!

301
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,520
- Please dear, just wake up
- No way!

302
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,400
God!

303
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,240
God!

304
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,320
Mom, thanks for screwing it all up!

305
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,880
Enough! Now, look at me and howl once!

306
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:33,640
Mom!

307
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,880
Told you to wake me up at 6!

308
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,080
You work so hard at office and I
noticed you were having a sound sleep

309
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,600
Didn't feel like waking
you up from a sound sleep

310
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,200
Uh-oh! A flat tyre?

311
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,720
- Hi dude
- Hi

312
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,240
Good morning

313
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,160
What's up, senior?

314
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,560
Your last chance. Looks like
you have prepared very well

315
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,000
What did he mean by 'Last chance?'

316
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,480
Indeed dude. If we don't clear it this
time then we don't get another chance

317
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,240
What do you mean?

318
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,760
Gandhi...

319
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,000
Wait!

320
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,480
Why are you so upset?

321
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,280
Obvious isn't it? If I fail
this exam then I'll lose my job

322
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,160
If I lose my job I'll lose my girlfriend.
If my girlfriend leave me then my life?

323
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,080
It is at such tough times, like this,
you must not lose confidence, Gandhi!

324
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,160
Such testing times means only one thing!

325
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,200
- It means only one thing!
- What's that?

326
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,040
It means something really good
and big is going to happen

327
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:39,160
Wait and watch, soon you dull
face will turn real bright!

328
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,840
Starting today, your life is
going to touch new heights!

329
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:43,800
Gandhi...

330
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,600
please help me in the exam if you
know any of the answers. Ok?

331
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,160
- Sir?
- Id!

332
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,200
Bro, got an eraser?

333
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,160
Here

334
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:13,600
Bro...

335
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,560
attending backlogs for a longtime?

336
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,320
Sorry, sir

337
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,320
What is it?

338
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:33,680
Pot head!

339
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,640
That was the very second my life changed!

340
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,240
You have a good job

341
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,520
- That is the sole reason I'm considering you
- What if you screw up in this exam?

342
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,080
If you lose your job, how
will we run a family?

343
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,880
Such testing times means only one thing!

344
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,320
- You have good job
- What if you screw up?

345
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,240
'Last chance?'

346
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,000
Already my family has a debt of 5 million!

347
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,440
Such testing times means only one thing!

348
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,520
Did I say anything wrong?

349
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:11,000
Title: NAAN SIRITHAL
(And when I laugh...)

350
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:17,800
Dude...

351
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:21,400
The topper is crying here but look at
Gandhi, who is here to clear backlog?

352
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,120
Dude!

353
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,000
Paper turned out as you expected?

354
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:34,720
We are gonna clear this exam, get ready
for marriage, set out lives and rock!

355
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,320
Now, tell me the answers

356
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,440
First 2 mark answers

357
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,400
Option A?

358
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,000
B?

359
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,760
Dude, say it properly!

360
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,800
My marriage

361
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,800
Come out, I'll split
your head open!

362
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,760
There was no fear in his eyes

363
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,280
The whole department is in shock!

364
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,680
A guy who is not intimidated
by that 16 mark question

365
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,680
He ain't a normal person!

366
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,600
Impossible!

367
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,840
Interesting!

368
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,640
You break out into a laughter
when you become sad?

369
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,200
So, what happens when you're happy?

370
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,360
I won't feel like laughing

371
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,520
Because my heart is full of sorrows

372
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:28,720
Of late I am unable to laugh
when someone cracks a good joke.

373
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,920
Is he laughing or crying?

374
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,160
Let's do a test

375
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,000
How about I crack a good joke?

376
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,280
Come here

377
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,000
Good joke!

378
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,480
You laughed!

379
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,640
You laughed! What else do you need?

380
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,640
Treatment ok!

381
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,320
I didn't find it funny!

382
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,240
Your joke wasn't funny at all, doctor!

383
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,400
I am laughing because
I'm sad, doctor!

384
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,400
Compose!

385
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,880
Compose!

386
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,680
Gandhi!

387
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,040
You have a condition called...

388
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,240
Nervous Laughter!

389
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,000
Sorrow, stress, fear and pain...

390
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,480
in such times, you will break in to
laughter without your knowledge!

391
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,240
Am I correct?

392
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,440
Yes doctor!

393
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,400
Gandhi, hear me out carefully

394
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,440
- Ok
- Don't panic!

395
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,920
Such emotions are very powerful!

396
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,440
Controlling your emotions...

397
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:43,000
with pills or medicines is impossible!

398
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:46,320
You will have to control
your mind to stop this

399
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,680
Now what do I do doctor?

400
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,760
Control yourself, Gandhi!
Nothing an be done

401
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:56,720
Only cure for this condition
is for it to fade away in time

402
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,000
Oh God! That's her...

403
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,000
Wonder why she is calling

404
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,480
Will she ask me how I did the exam?

405
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,200
How did the exam go?

406
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,000
Well...

407
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,600
Why are you quiet?

408
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,880
- Hello
- Sorry, Ankita

409
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,600
Sorry? Screwed it up?

410
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,520
If you fail this exam, you'll lose your job

411
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,000
My family won't agree to our
wedding if you don't have a job

412
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,640
Yet you screw it up. So you
just don't care, right?

413
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,560
- Well, Anki..
- Stop!

414
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,280
Forget it, Gandhi

415
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,160
It's over

416
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,480
Let's break up

417
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,360
I was at Ganesh's house
roof to cut cake for him

418
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,840
Exactly at midnight, I heard a laughter

419
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,040
I checked and it was...

420
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:03,640
What is gong on?

421
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,920
How could you leave you only son
alone in the terrace at night?

422
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,160
Paulraj, who resided in the 2nd street

423
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,280
The Late. Paulraj!

424
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:14,920
Dear...

425
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,680
it sounded exactly like his laughter!

426
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,840
Take your son to Veerabadhran
temple and perform exorcism on him

427
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:36,520
Ok

428
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:40,600
Lord Veerabadhra! Come on, bless us!
Bless us!

429
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:44,360
Lord Veerabadhra! Come on, bless us!
Bless us!

430
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,320
This is taken from the Lord's wrist

431
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,040
Priest, don't you have a brand new one?

432
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,840
This is powerful! You shouldn't
remove it for 6months

433
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,800
Until it's tied to your wrist,
no evil spirit will near you!

434
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,880
What if it unties?

435
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,560
Quiet, dad!

436
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,160
If it unties, then from
the very next minute...

437
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,160
you will find yourself in danger!

438
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,680
You'll come across many wrong people!

439
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,800
Your life will be in danger!

440
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,520
I have conveyed your problems
to Lord Veerabadhran!

441
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,720
He'll take care of you!

442
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,000
Until this vow is complete, you
must not tell about it to anyone!

443
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,880
Understood?

444
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:34,680
What happened?

445
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,360
This is his problem. He keeps laughing!

446
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,000
Gandhi, just tell him if you any problems

447
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,840
"Come on, buddy! Look around!"

448
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,000
"Nothing is mine or yours or
anyone's for that matter!"

449
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,120
"Come on, buddy! Look around!"

450
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,760
"Nothing is mine or yours or
anyone's for that matter!"

451
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:57,320
"She said "Let's break up"
but what's my fault?"

452
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,760
"For no fault of mine, she
called me a baddie villain"

453
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,440
"That electrocuted me and my heart"

454
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:07,000
"I am burnt to ashes and
time to press 'restart'"

455
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,720
"She asked me to get lost and go die!"

456
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,720
"I ask God 'Why me? Why?'"

457
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,840
"She wants me gone! She wants me dead!"

458
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:19,000
"But I got my buddies to
keep me moving ahead"

459
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,840
"Let me tell you why my heart aches"

460
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,120
"She changed her status to
"Single" and that's all it takes"

461
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,880
"I am depressed and I
cannot take it anymore"

462
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,080
"Knowing that my photo is
not her wallpaper anymore!"

463
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,920
"She said 'Let's break up!'"

464
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:52,160
"She told me 'Let's break up!'"

465
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,920
"She said 'Let's break up!'"

466
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,760
"She told me 'Let's break up!'"

467
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:01,520
"I have this laughing condition, I can't
show my emotion and I laugh in depression"

468
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,440
"My life is screwed, so is love.
Now, I laugh in confusion"

469
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:07,520
"I can't even say it out and
so I hid it in delusion"

470
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:10,640
"Problems are all I have and
laugh is only solution"

471
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,440
"I now laugh to forget my love"

472
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:16,320
"I now laugh to forget my girl"

473
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,520
"I now laugh thinking about
how my life in danger"

474
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:22,400
"I now laugh to beat the anger"

475
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:25,480
"Let me tell you why my heart aches"

476
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:28,640
"She changed her status to
"Single" and that's all it takes"

477
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:31,480
"I am depressed and I
cannot take it anymore"

478
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:34,840
"Knowing that my photo is
not her wallpaper anymore!"

479
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,280
"She said 'Let's break up!'"

480
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:40,240
"She told me 'Let's break up!'"

481
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,160
"She said 'Let's break up!'"

482
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:46,240
"She told me 'Let's break up!'"

483
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
"My love life is over
and life in down low"

484
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:53,240
"I have lost control and
going I am going crazy now!"

485
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,320
A vow for 6 months

486
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:25,000
The priest asked me to
keep the vow a secret

487
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,400
Let me tell you how I
struggled those 6 months

488
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,080
What struggles did
you go through?

489
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,240
May 1st!

490
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,240
Labour's day

491
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,840
Thala Ajith Kumar's birthday!

492
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,920
I went for the screening of fans' show

493
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,520
The one person I hate the
most in this world...

494
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,600
is my father!

495
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,000
When my friends ask me about him...

496
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,080
I feel like crying

497
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,040
Excuse me!

498
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,920
His legs are longer and taller than him!

499
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:30,120
Now listen to me!

500
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,360
Take the kid and go to the ground!

501
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,080
How dare you?

502
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,440
Been noticing you
since beginning!

503
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,120
How dare you laugh and
mock at emotional scenes?

504
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,880
You must be a Vijay fan!

505
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:43,000
Nothing like that. I
watch every star's movie

506
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:47,320
Now, listen! Watch it for
our star Thala's hardwork!

507
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,680
Do you know who I am?

508
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,600
'Mankatha' Mahesh!

509
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,560
'Dheena' Dhayal!

510
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,920
'Red' Kannan!

511
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,040
Ball! 'Vaali' Ball!

512
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,440
Is that even a name?

513
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,520
This is your last warning!

514
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,160
Laugh and you'll see
stars around your head!

515
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:04,920
No!

516
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,360
I think they mistook it as our star

517
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,120
You'll be a goner!

518
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,160
Why are you punching from behind?

519
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,120
The same is happening to
our star in the fight!

520
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,800
But nothing will happen to him.
I know!

521
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,920
How emotional!

522
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,120
Can you call me out once

523
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,600
Father!

524
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,400
My dear!

525
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,640
You are a goner!

526
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,480
Hit him!

527
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,160
22nd June

528
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,440
Wait, I know

529
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:34,800
World Chocolate day!

530
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,680
'Thalapathy' Vijay's birthday!

531
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:37,720
Right!

532
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,320
I went for fans' screening
for his movie too

533
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,120
Really?

534
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,800
The last life to be lost
in this hospital...

535
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,600
should be my life

536
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,600
Come on, don't say so

537
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:13,520
Boss!

538
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,600
You shouldn't laugh at that scene!

539
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,520
Ok, brother

540
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,720
Buddy, patience

541
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,240
Guys, I swear I am
touched by the scene

542
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,240
I am not allowed to say
why I laugh like this

543
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:40,440
Lord Veerabadhra, please
ensure I reach home safe

544
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,880
What have you guys done?

545
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,360
How dare you?

546
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,640
Mocking, are you?

547
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,920
You must be an Ajith fan!

548
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:52,760
Believe me, no...

549
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,120
Aren't you the guy who trolls
our star with memes in Facebook

550
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,200
Brother, I am a neutral guy

551
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,640
Neutral? Where do hear that word often?

552
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,520
In bike gear

553
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,680
- Who is known for bike racing?
- Thala! (My Head!)

554
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,360
See that? He said it himself!
That he is a 'Thala' Ajith fan

555
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:08,520
Dear hardcore fan, there is no
logic at all in your judgment!

556
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:11,040
Guys, he just said that there is
no logic in our star's movie!

557
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,640
Amsa, bring the coffee

558
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:21,080
Wondering why I brought my parents to your
home after telling you "Lets break up"

559
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,840
I have talked a great deal
about you to my parents

560
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,560
So, keep a smiling
face like this

561
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,440
Don't speak and screw things up

562
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,200
Ok? Come on

563
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:35,000
Uh-oh! Wonder what's gonna happen now

564
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,480
Lord Veerabadhra! Save me!

565
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,320
Sir, have some chips

566
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,000
No thanks

567
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,280
Fine, I'll have some

568
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,320
Gandhi?

569
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:47,720
Own house

570
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,360
Team lead in an IT company

571
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,520
And a monthly salary of 0.1 million.
My daughter told me

572
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,000
So...

573
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:59,280
I see it's quite conjested outside
your home. Where do you park the car?

574
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,240
Car?

575
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,520
He's talking about your car!

576
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:06,720
Didn't you tell me that kids play and hit
the ball on it. Hence you parked it away

577
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,000
Car! Our car!

578
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:14,400
The crows crap on it. The
neighbour's son pees on it

579
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:16,680
We are tired of washing it.
Also very little space here

580
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:19,520
So parked at a friend's place nearby.
There's lot of space there. Right?

581
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,160
Ankita...

582
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,320
won't it be too sultry
here during summer?

583
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,680
Yes, sir!

584
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,160
But...Winter is coming!

585
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:29,120
See I quoted the 'Game of thrones'

586
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:33,200
So, you just hold a B.E degree...

587
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,720
- Or anything more?
- Well...

588
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,600
I hear that he has written the
CAT or GRE exam. Isn't it?

589
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,680
He cleared GRE, mom

590
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,840
Soon he'll go abroad

591
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,040
Abroad?

592
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,360
He is very "bookish" like that

593
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,320
Also...

594
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,240
something else too...

595
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,080
Not getting it

596
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,200
Something else?

597
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,280
Wonder what else she told him

598
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,000
- Coffee!
- Coffee!

599
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:53,600
Coffee!

600
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,160
- Coffee
- Please have

601
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,120
So, how did you write the exam, Gandhi?

602
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,600
He has done it really well

603
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:03,640
He will clear all his backlogs this time!

604
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,600
Look what you did

605
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:15,480
Dad...

606
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:16,920
Napkin

607
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,520
I had kept it here

608
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:19,360
Sir

609
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,000
Wipe your face

610
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,760
Give it to mom

611
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,400
Why would you do that, dad?

612
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,400
Backlogs?

613
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,520
Don't you worry!

614
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,040
My son will become an engineer soon

615
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,720
He is a responsible boy

616
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:37,800
He wouldn't want to lose his job. Else how
will he repay the bike loan and house rent?

617
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,200
Gandhi, let's run!

618
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,800
- Bike loan?
- Of course!

619
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,000
I can't believe this!

620
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,080
- House rent?
- Yes!

621
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,920
- Why are you laughing?
- Gandhi!

622
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,680
Why are you even laughing?

623
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,080
What's going on?

624
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,160
Are you insulting my father?

625
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,760
Gandhi, now quiet!

626
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,680
Are you guys insulting us?

627
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,560
Not at all

628
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:02,520
Sir...

629
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:03,760
Gandhi...

630
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:04,560
Gandhi!

631
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,200
I am furious and you're
laughing like crazy?

632
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:06,760
Sir please...

633
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,560
"It looks like I am laughing all the time"

634
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,080
"I swear I am not! Not this time!"

635
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:15,600
"What if I tell you that I feel so grey?"

636
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:18,200
"Why does that make you stare
at me in a strange way?"

637
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,680
"It might look like I am laughing"

638
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,000
"But I swear I am not laughing"

639
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,880
"What if I tell you that I feel so grey?"

640
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,080
"Why does that make you stare
at me in a strange way?"

641
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,480
Get lost!

642
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,040
My foot!

643
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,280
"Life is mocking and laughing at me"

644
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,560
"Life is mocking and laughing at me"

645
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,680
"Oh yeah, it is laughing at me"

646
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,440
"Oh God! Fine! Laugh! Laugh all you want"

647
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,800
"Laugh your way to glory!"

648
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:06,120
"To those laughing on me;
I laugh back at you"

649
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:11,320
"To those laughing on me;
I laugh back at you"

650
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,920
"Yes, I am laughing at you"

651
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,600
" I am laughing at you"

652
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:19,080
" I am laughing at you"

653
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:26,120
"In happiness and sorry, keep laughing"

654
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:31,360
"No matter what happens, we will face it.
So keep laughing"

655
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:36,520
"During tough times, keep laughing"

656
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,760
"Keep laughing"

657
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:42,320
"No matter what happens, we will face it.
So keep laughing"

658
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:57,080
"Life is mocking and laughing at me"

659
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,480
"Life is mocking and laughing at me"

660
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,280
"My love life..."

661
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,720
"My life..."

662
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,400
"Day and night...."

663
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,080
"This is my fight..."

664
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:24,360
"And when I laugh..."

665
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,680
"an earthquake occurs and
the Lord will shiver"

666
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,520
"Every living being will run away in fear"

667
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:33,600
Couples who made a Tik Tok video on rail line
where killed when a train rammed them down

668
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,440
"My life..."

669
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,200
"Day and Night..."

670
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,000
Gandhi, please. Stop laughing

671
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,320
Our son's laughing!

672
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,200
- He's laughing!
- Dad's crying!

673
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,000
- He's laughing!
- Dad's crying, mom!

674
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,000
Alright!

675
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,200
I somehow managed to cross 5
months and almost the 6th one

676
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,400
But the last one week...

677
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,440
It took the life out of me!

678
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,520
Why? What happened?

679
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,000
We have so many friends from our school
days to our current working place

680
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:09,480
But friends who grow up with us from
childhood, in the same locality...

681
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,400
Definitely we'll have
one such special friend

682
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,120
We'd hang out with him all the time

683
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,720
But out of the blue he'll
fall in love and forget us

684
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,840
Yet, we'll wish him happiness
no matter where he is

685
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,760
And we'll move on with our work

686
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:25,920
Suddenly if an issue pops
up in his love life and...

687
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:28,120
if he goes missing, how'd
you react to that?

688
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,360
My friend Dillibabu went missing

689
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:38,000
If my husband was alive, at least he
could go around, inquire and find him

690
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,640
Where will I look for him?

691
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,240
Whom can I ask to help me?

692
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,440
Come on, please don't feel so bad

693
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,800
We are here for you as your sons

694
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,240
You just calm down and relax

695
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,480
Call me if you see Dilli

696
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,880
We inquired all around our area
in our pursuit to find Dillibabu

697
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,040
- But none of them saw him
- Did Babu come there?

698
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:01,240
We tried to get the details
of his girlfriend at least

699
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,720
But we had no luck

700
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:07,000
Hand over the hard disk to
the minister after the party

701
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:07,520
Ok, boss

702
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,000
- Invited everyone?
- Yes, boss

703
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,040
'Court' Mariappan?

704
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,320
- Alphonse?
- Invited, boss

705
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,920
- Triplicane Afsal
- Invited, boss

706
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,320
Did you invite Sakkara Das?

707
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,680
I did, boss but looks
like he is out of station

708
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,040
His men will come for the party

709
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,400
He's a nothing!

710
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,760
He'll definitely sketch out
a plan to finish me off

711
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,840
Today's Dilli Babu's birthday right?

712
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,120
Last year my birthday was
celebrated like a festival!

713
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,480
That made him jealous

714
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,280
Boss, he hardly has any good henchmen

715
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,840
We almost finished most of them.
Whom will he send to finish you?

716
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:41,080
It seems he has few. In fact he has a
separate guy for his finance collection

717
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,400
His name is 'Collection' Shekar

718
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,880
He is the man around when it
comes to collect loaned finance

719
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,760
Also, he has hired 2 more men

720
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:50,120
1 guys looks like an IT professional

721
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,480
Quiet sharp fellow it seems

722
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,040
Very dedicated towards his work

723
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:57,200
Another guy is well built
but looks innocent

724
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,560
Quiet an impulsive guy

725
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,320
So, what is our plan?

726
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,160
We are sending vehicles
to pick all our guests

727
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:07,240
That's safe for us. We have
informed everyone about it

728
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:08,680
To board the car...

729
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,200
What's that?

730
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:11,760
Boss?

731
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,640
- A banner with you on it
- I know that!

732
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,120
But why is my face not seen?

733
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,040
Boss, aren't you absconding
according to police?

734
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,640
That is why we are not revealing you

735
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:19,320
Indeed!

736
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,480
Who came up with
this idea, dear?

737
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,600
It is my brainchild, boss

738
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,160
Awesome!

739
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,600
Why are you screaming like
I shot you in the chest?

740
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,320
Stop screaming! So you were saying...

741
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:33,640
The car...

742
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,400
Why are you stuttering?

743
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,000
Drink water and then tell me

744
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,400
Aren't you dead yet?

745
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:41,240
Go!

746
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,880
Make banners where my
face is clear and bold!

747
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,800
Or else you'll obituary
poster will be made!

748
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:46,440
Ok, boss

749
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:48,680
Quenched your thirst?

750
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,560
Now, tell me .To board the car?

751
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:55,640
The last four digits on every
guest's mobile is their code

752
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:59,600
'Court' Kumar's number is 9444131157

753
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,520
So his code is 1157

754
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,080
Only then our driver will pick him up

755
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,600
Who came up with this idea?

756
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:06,400
Him

757
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,440
What the heck!

758
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,040
They'll send a car for pick up

759
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:12,480
I said couple of my men
will attend on my behalf

760
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:13,720
I want you both to go

761
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:14,760
Welcome!

762
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,000
Are you sure you want these 2 to go?

763
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,440
- Wait and see what I do to you
- Mosquito!

764
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:24,280
Did you collect money from the
guy who owes us 5 million?

765
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,000
I'm going to his locality today evening.
I'll collect it

766
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,680
First, focus on your job and get it done

767
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,080
He has been missing for 2 days now

768
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,280
How about we lodge a police complaint

769
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:42,240
Get your bike. Let's go and check it out

770
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,760
I left it for service

771
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:44,640
Book an Ola cab

772
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,640
- That'd work
- He'll only book!

773
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:00,120
The pick up car will wait
by Selva Vinayagar temple

774
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,080
Listen to me!

775
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:08,000
Don't disconnect the call. We want
to hear what they are talking

776
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,200
"8116"

777
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:12,920
"8116"

778
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:15,640
Say this code, board the
vehicle and head to the party

779
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,360
- First time?
- Yes

780
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,400
I came to city to become a gangster

781
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:22,320
Our boss took me in and will make
me a gangster when right time comes

782
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,280
And now suddenly he handed this project

783
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:26,120
- Hope you won't  screw up
- God no!

784
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,400
Tell me and I'll obey you

785
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:30,400
It's loading but no cabs booked yet

786
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,480
Don't worry I'll pay

787
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,360
Seriously it's not loading

788
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:35,880
- Dude! Dude!
- Wait, I'm checking

789
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,640
Hold on! Give me your phone
to recharge net pack

790
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:40,120
- Give me your phone
- Wait! Wait, I'll give

791
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:42,000
- I'll give, wait
- Take out the phone!

792
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:44,040
My PUBG team is getting busted!

793
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:46,480
- Please, quick! Give me the phone
- Wait, I'll give!

794
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,160
If it unties...

795
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:51,800
you will find yourself in danger!

796
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:53,560
We got the One Time
passcode for our cab!

797
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,440
Connected? Good, let's
continue the game

798
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:57,480
Thanks Gandhi

799
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:58,040
Hello

800
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:00,840
Cab driver here. I'm in a different car.
Not in the one that the app shows

801
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:04,240
I am waiting below the deity's
cutout near the temple

802
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:11,080
You'll come across many wrong people!

803
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:12,440
Your life will be in danger!

804
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:18,000
Until this vow is complete, you
must not tell about it to anyone!

805
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:25,040
Ravi will be there to help you

806
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:27,320
Get the work done properly!

807
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:28,480
Properly!

808
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:29,480
Got it?

809
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:31,640
I only understood this

810
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,520
We'll go, step out....

811
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:35,520
and finish him off!

812
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,840
- This car?
- Yes, this one

813
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:55,360
Boss, I saw them

814
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,880
But they have their reservation
about getting into the car

815
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:00,200
But the car number is different

816
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:02,720
The cab driver said that he's
coming in a different car

817
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,640
Boss, tell me how they look

818
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,600
A stout fellow...

819
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,240
but has a childish behaviour

820
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,360
The 2nd guy looks very sweet

821
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:13,360
But he's the real poison
that will kill us

822
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,560
But the number plate
is in white board

823
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:18,040
Correct but there is also a 3rd person

824
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:19,320
'Collection' Shekar!

825
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,120
Sakkara has sent 3 of his men

826
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:23,000
All of them are trapped
like chickens!

827
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,320
Sir, the OTP number please

828
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:27,840
Now what's an OTP?

829
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:28,400
What's that?

830
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:31,640
- Sir, the 4 number code sent to your mobile number
- That one!

831
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:37,640
"8116"

832
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:39,880
- All set. Come on
- Boss, it's them! Confirmed!

833
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:40,920
3 of them are there

834
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,480
Don't disconnect the call.
Just pick them and come

835
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:45,840
We shall finish them nice and slow!

836
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,280
- Correct? Get in!
- Yes

837
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:48,920
- Get in
- Ok

838
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,080
Stop playing with the phone and get in

839
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:53,560
Driver, turn on the AC

840
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:56,600
Sir...

841
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
where's the drop point?

842
00:45:58,120 --> 00:45:59,360
Stop acting like you don't know

843
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:01,720
Just take us to that place. Go!

844
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,280
Fine, I'll follow the map in the app

845
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,360
We'll go, step out
and finish him off!

846
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,680
Why are you selfish?

847
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:30,560
Increase the volume

848
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:31,880
There!

849
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:35,680
Sir...

850
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:40,240
Sir...

851
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:42,920
Aren't you scared at all?

852
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:45,320
Or do you have other ideas?

853
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:49,160
We'll go, step out
and finish him off!

854
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:49,880
Step out...

855
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:51,520
As soon as we step out?

856
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:52,160
Top notch!

857
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:53,560
Listen, Ravi...

858
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,640
my men aren't dummies!

859
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:58,320
They are like two bullets
triggered from two snipers!

860
00:46:58,680 --> 00:46:59,920
Their target is fixed!

861
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:01,600
They won't rest until job is done

862
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,400
They are coming down with a rage!

863
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:04,880
Listen, Sakkara...

864
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,120
I have an excellent plan

865
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:08,520
It'll be more easier

866
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,360
Does your plan end with Dilli's death?

867
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:12,200
I want Dilli dead. Does you
plan end with Dilli's death?

868
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:13,360
Listen to me Sakkara...

869
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:16,080
I want Dilli dead. Does you
plan end with Dilli's death?

870
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:16,880
Listen to me!

871
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,720
You baldie! Hang up now!

872
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,400
Doofus!

873
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:21,880
This is why I don't
attend his calls

874
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,440
Keeps advising all the time!

875
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:25,840
Dilli!

876
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:28,200
I'll bring the grandest and biggest garland

877
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,320
Get that garland shop's contact!

878
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:34,600
'Your time is up...'

879
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:36,840
Drive carefully or all our time will be up!

880
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:38,640
He'll finish 10 of them by himself!

881
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:43,000
Now, we 3 are coming. We'll
finish off the whole gang!

882
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:44,280
Boss!

883
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:46,680
- That too when you are here?
- Too much, right?

884
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:48,880
But sir, there will be
lot of them over there

885
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:52,120
Will you let me enjoy the music?

886
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,800
Nice song. Who is the music director?

887
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,760
Hope you guys are wearing
the bullet proof jacket

888
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:59,000
Bullet proof jacket?

889
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:02,080
Boss, until now we have
seen it only in the movies

890
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:03,920
Of late Dilli Babu is being too arrogant

891
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:05,720
Keeps running off and hides

892
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,800
This time when I catch hold of him...

893
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:09,840
Wait and watch!

894
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,000
First, let the 3 of us go in

895
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:13,360
Hope the sniper is ready

896
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:15,000
Get to the top of the building...

897
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,840
and when you have the aim,
shoot right on the forehead!

898
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:18,920
His head must splash!

899
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:20,640
Boss, why do you look worried?

900
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
If he has sniper, you have me!
I'll kill them all!

901
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:25,920
Look kiddo, make sure our
men are placed all over

902
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:26,640
With weapons!

903
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:27,560
Got it?

904
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:28,520
Ok, boss!

905
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:37,280
Sir Rs. 157

906
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:42,520
Just wait

907
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:52,320
Don't step out. The scene is
totally different outside

908
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:54,880
This song has made an impact inside me

909
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,880
Don't you step out! Things
are not looking good!

910
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,920
I am fearless! What? Things
are not looking good?

911
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:00,840
Increase the volume!

912
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:02,640
I am here to wreck havoc!

913
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,360
- Listen to me!
- Don't you order me!

914
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:05,560
Move!

915
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:07,120
Listen to me!

916
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:09,360
Move away!

917
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:11,040
What was the plan?

918
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,440
We'll get down and put him down!

919
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:14,640
Uh-oh!

920
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:18,720
Thought we'll put him
down not the weapons

921
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,520
- Fine
- Look straight!

922
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:21,800
Straight?

923
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:27,800
Oh Lord, please ensure
we reach home safe!

924
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:29,000
Hallelujah!

925
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:37,320
What's going on?

926
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,360
The trip has already ended in the app

927
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,040
Some problem with the app?

928
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:44,680
Gandhi, do one thing.
Pay and cut the driver off

929
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:46,200
Please! No! God!

930
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:48,520
- Why are you screaming? What's wrong?
- Please! No!

931
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:51,520
Come on, bro. Don't worry

932
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,760
You know our problem
hence you're saying "No"

933
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:56,320
But this is your job and
we must settle you!

934
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:57,880
Please, I have wife and kids

935
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,520
Which is why I'm telling that
it's our duty to cut you off here

936
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:03,680
Wait. Watch we me do it for you

937
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:05,760
You do one thing, wait
here for 5 minutes

938
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:07,920
We'll just check if Dilli
is here and return

939
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:09,720
- Ok. Sounds good
- I'll go check if Dilli is around

940
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,000
Looks like a party. Whoa!

941
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:30,920
Hope you won't tell anyone

942
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:32,240
Looking for Dilli Babu, right?

943
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:33,560
Wearing a blue color coat...

944
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:35,240
He is inside

945
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:37,080
- Go, meet him. Go!
- Coat?

946
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:38,800
That doofus wears a coat?

947
00:50:58,760 --> 00:50:59,600
Uh-oh! Ouch!

948
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,480
Doesn't look like a place
Dilli would like to come

949
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:17,680
How is that you drink so
much when the booze is free?

950
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:18,280
4 out!

951
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:19,600
- Mani! Mani!
- Superb!

952
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:21,240
What are you doing here?

953
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:23,080
I came looking for Dilli

954
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:25,000
Why would Dilli come to such a place?

955
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:26,920
If he is depressed, then
chances are he might

956
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:29,880
Bloody Sakkara Das gang!

957
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:31,400
You are done for!

958
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:34,120
Boss, confirm

959
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:36,040
Sakkara Das' men

960
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,520
They are talking about
finishing off our boss

961
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:42,280
Look at them, boss.
Very dangerous fellows

962
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:45,200
They don't know where is our boss.
They are looking for him

963
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:53,840
See that gesture? They are
planning to butcher him down!

964
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:56,120
They are here with a rage!

965
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:57,920
What's your name?

966
00:51:59,080 --> 00:51:59,880
Nelson, sir

967
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:01,480
- Your name?
- Manickam

968
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:02,800
Where are you coming from?

969
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,840
From Nelson Manickam road

970
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:06,600
Give me that

971
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:07,680
Sir!

972
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:10,360
- Hello
- Ravi!

973
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:11,560
Did Manickam reach?

974
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:14,280
- No, Manickam is not here
- He is not there?

975
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:15,920
3 new guys have come

976
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:16,920
They look weak!

977
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:17,480
Is it?

978
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:19,280
They came in the car sent for you

979
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:21,040
Your men, right?

980
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:22,240
No

981
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:26,160
I sent Manickam and the guy who joined
newly as supervisor in my company

982
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:28,440
- Let me talk to Manickam and get back to you
- Ok

983
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,160
Wonder where they slipped

984
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:33,320
Damn! Enough please

985
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:35,480
Uh-oh!

986
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:37,560
Manickam, where are you?

987
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:40,120
Well, at the Poonamallee po....

988
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:41,400
Po?

989
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:42,440
Po?

990
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:44,240
Complete your sentence!

991
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:48,000
Doofus! I said say it!

992
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:49,880
Is your mouth stuffed?

993
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:52,480
Enough! I'll complete your sentence!

994
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:54,120
Poonamallee Green Park, right?

995
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:56,920
Why are you not replying? Ravi
tells me you're not over there

996
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:58,920
Return only after finishing off Dilli Babu!

997
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:01,880
Boss, they are Sakkara Das' men

998
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:03,320
Shall we finish them off?

999
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:05,800
Never be in a hurry to finish off anyone

1000
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:08,160
After all we are the seniors

1001
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:10,680
First, let's rag them and have some fun...

1002
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:12,120
and then we'll finish them off

1003
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:23,200
What's up, bros?

1004
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:25,160
Aren't you having anything today?

1005
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:27,720
We are teetotalers

1006
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:31,240
For how long will you keep drining tea?
Have some booze today!

1007
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:32,320
Drink and have fun!

1008
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:35,080
This is the last day of your lives

1009
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:39,720
I mean drink and have fun like
it's the last day of you life

1010
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:41,840
Happy Birthday, boss!

1011
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,640
Same to you, boss!

1012
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:45,880
Sir, if we knew it was
your birthday today...

1013
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,240
I would have gifted you a garland!

1014
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,840
I am too going to
gift you a boquet

1015
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:53,400
- He is a bit of crack pot, isn't he?
- You can say so

1016
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:54,160
Shut up!

1017
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:55,160
Uncle...

1018
00:53:58,200 --> 00:53:59,400
That was a bit too much

1019
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:01,000
Tell me, dear

1020
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:02,160
Happy birthday, uncle

1021
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:03,120
Uncle?

1022
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:05,160
Noted! Noted!

1023
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:07,280
But I won't get upset at all today

1024
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:08,040
Ask me why

1025
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:10,360
Because today is my birthday and I'm happy!

1026
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:12,200
So have fun! High-five!

1027
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:13,360
Uncle, me too

1028
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:14,000
No!

1029
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:15,280
Boss...

1030
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:16,400
Lets do it!

1031
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:19,440
Why are you in a hurry?

1032
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:20,640
Sir!

1033
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:21,720
Dude, no!

1034
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:24,320
Thank you, sir

1035
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,240
We still have a minute to go!

1036
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:27,920
Why are you in a hurry?

1037
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:32,560
So eager to have the cake? Even
I'm not as excited as you are

1038
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:33,640
Sir!

1039
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:35,680
His watch!

1040
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:38,560
Why are you guys so eager? We'll do it!

1041
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,280
It's gonna be awesome!

1042
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:41,520
- Correct!
- Come on, dear

1043
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:42,480
Thank you, sir

1044
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:44,120
How does our points table look?

1045
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:47,400
Today's my birthday why are
these guys names on it?

1046
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:48,720
Chennai Gangsters Leagu

1047
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:50,360
We are the senior players...

1048
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:52,920
and like Dhoni we are the kings
in finishing things off in style

1049
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,840
Read it, Winner Dilli Babu!

1050
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,520
Sir! It's time! Cut the cake!

1051
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:59,400
Give me that, I must
first cut him down...

1052
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:01,920
Wondering why such a long
knife to slit your throat?

1053
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:04,200
It's for the cake. That's
the trend these days!

1054
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:04,760
Trend!

1055
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,080
- Shall I cut it?
- Please!

1056
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:07,080
First piece is for you

1057
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:08,920
Me? Look at that dude,
first piece is for me

1058
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,800
No song before cutting the cake?

1059
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:12,560
Boss, he is an expert in singing

1060
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:13,800
Do your HipHop style!

1061
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:15,320
He will sing!

1062
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:17,480
- He can rap in one breath!
- Is it?

1063
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:18,160
Dear...

1064
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:20,560
- Come here
- Yes, uncle?

1065
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:22,240
Breathe and sing

1066
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:23,880
After you finishi singing...

1067
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:25,680
then we'll take a call on your breathing

1068
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:28,840
He is so funny! Superb, sir!

1069
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:40,640
"Knvies that stab in the name of money..."

1070
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:42,800
"is now showing affection
more than your honey"

1071
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:44,920
"Even in a gang of gangsters..."

1072
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:47,240
"the boss is just a sweet monster"

1073
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:49,760
"Come you henchmen, time to rock"

1074
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:51,560
"Let me tell you my story, I'm
the new kid in the block"

1075
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:54,000
"As I sing, keep dancing"

1076
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:56,040
"Let the world watch as we
keep rocking and rolling"

1077
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:59,200
"Happy birthday to you"

1078
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:00,760
"To our dear boss..."

1079
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:03,440
"Happy birthday to you"

1080
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:04,760
"To our king..."

1081
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:07,800
"Happy birthday to you"

1082
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:09,080
"To our dear boss..."

1083
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:12,280
"Happy birthday to you"

1084
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:13,680
"To our king..."

1085
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:34,920
"You handle the machete like a flower,
uncle! So, tell me how are you?"

1086
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:39,840
"I am stuck here and struggling to get out!
Dear buddy, where are you?"

1087
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:44,280
"Threatens us and snatches
all our money, your honour"

1088
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:48,880
"Must make him quite famous
so let's erect a banner"

1089
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,040
"All we know is roam in a luxury car"

1090
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:53,120
"Take money and commit murder"

1091
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:57,480
"One blow by him will make
the whole place go crazy"

1092
00:56:57,560 --> 00:57:00,480
"Happy birthday to you"

1093
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:01,840
"To our braveheart..."

1094
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:04,800
"Happy birthday to you"

1095
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:06,040
"To our darling..."

1096
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:09,280
"Happy birthday to you"

1097
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:10,560
"To our braveheart..."

1098
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:13,680
"Happy birthday to you"

1099
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:15,000
"To our darling..."

1100
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:35,640
"Happy birthday to you"

1101
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:36,920
"To our dear boss..."

1102
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:39,840
"Happy birthday to you"

1103
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:41,200
"To our king..."

1104
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:44,360
"Happy birthday to you"

1105
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:45,560
"To our dear boss..."

1106
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:48,840
"Happy birthday to you"

1107
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:50,360
"To our king..."

1108
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:52,080
"To our king..."

1109
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:03,200
- Hello, excuse me....
- Who are these new kids?

1110
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:04,680
They are showing off too much

1111
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:06,600
They are Sakkara Das' men

1112
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:08,040
They are here to finish off our boss

1113
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:09,160
Wait and watch...

1114
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:12,040
our boss will massacre them tonight!

1115
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:12,760
Thiyagu!

1116
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:13,840
Let's leave at once

1117
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:14,440
Let's leave

1118
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:16,160
- Gandhi?
- We'll call him!

1119
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:17,640
- Come on! Come on
- Fine, wait

1120
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:19,280
I can't hear you

1121
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:21,240
Did you get hold of Dilli or not?

1122
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:23,720
If I catch hold of
Dillibabu, he will be dead!

1123
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:59,360
Whom were you talking to?

1124
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:01,040
To a friend

1125
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:04,800
Never trust your friends

1126
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:07,200
Because I too had a friend

1127
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:09,320
His name is Sakkara Das

1128
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:13,880
He wanted become powerful than me

1129
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,240
Nothing wrong in it

1130
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:15,840
No

1131
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:18,720
But he wants to finish off the
person who taught him the trade

1132
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:19,760
Now, that's wrong. Isn't it?

1133
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:20,280
Definitely!

1134
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:24,320
That too he sends his men to
finish me off on my birthday!

1135
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:24,840
Birthday?

1136
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:26,800
Oh my God!

1137
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:30,840
I thought you are a good singer and a
dancer but you are also an excellent actor!

1138
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:33,480
Guess why I wanted you to sing?

1139
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:35,560
You don't know, right?

1140
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:38,800
Tell me why people have a goat farm?

1141
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:40,040
To decorate it and enjoy?

1142
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:43,240
No!

1143
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:45,480
Why do people have chicken farm?

1144
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:46,400
To pamper them?

1145
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,560
It is for meat!

1146
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:12,200
Do you think this is a toy gun?

1147
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:15,760
Why are you laughing?

1148
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:19,120
Answer me! Why are you laughing?

1149
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:27,520
Was this Sakkara Das' idea?

1150
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:30,760
Did he ask you to embarrass
me in front of my people?

1151
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:33,520
Tell me! The why are you laughing?

1152
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:35,600
Shall I finish you off? Shall I?

1153
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:38,000
Boss, he is mocking at us!

1154
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:41,400
- Look at him!
- Just finish him off, boss!

1155
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:45,440
No, I think Sakkara Das has
planned up something else

1156
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:49,000
He has planned up some idea to
finish us all with his help

1157
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:49,760
No!

1158
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:52,120
No! He must cry!

1159
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:53,800
He must cry and beg for life!

1160
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:55,840
He must cry begging to me for life!

1161
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,200
He must weep!

1162
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:02,560
Tie him up on this lamp
post and rip him apart!

1163
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:03,280
Now!

1164
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:09,240
Look! He's laughing even
after he has been tied up!

1165
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:10,680
I am scared! Please, boss!

1166
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:21,000
It'd have been over
if he has kept quiet

1167
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:22,720
Look at him laugh!

1168
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:25,160
They will finish him
off nice and slow

1169
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:27,560
Poor fellow

1170
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:28,920
He is kind person

1171
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:30,800
He tipped me 200 rupees

1172
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:34,840
Poor fellow!

1173
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,360
I have conveyed your problems
to Lord Veerabadhran!

1174
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:45,840
He'll take care of you!

1175
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,480
25 years ago Dayalan laughed
and embarrassed Dilli...

1176
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:08,360
Dilli finished him at that very
moment and took over his place

1177
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:10,320
25 years later...

1178
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:12,880
this fellow laughs at Dilli

1179
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:15,120
Look, he keeps laughing!

1180
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:16,800
Arrogant fellow!
Doesn't stop laughing!

1181
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:17,880
He's laughing at our boss!

1182
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:19,760
He's laughing at our boss!

1183
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:53,800
Lord Veerabhadra, save me!

1184
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:23,600
Don't got out in rain,
you'll catch cold!

1185
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:25,520
Must be an urgent ride

1186
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:28,320
You....doofus!

1187
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,240
Watering the plants? Fool, come on!

1188
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:41,040
Coming

1189
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:42,360
What's this?

1190
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:44,200
- Look! Police!
- You better hand over the gun!

1191
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:46,280
He doesn't know to shoot!

1192
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:48,680
Come on! Don't run, officer!

1193
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:55,760
That fear in your eyes, thats all I need

1194
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:59,160
Don't I know that I won't get
bail if I shoot an officer?

1195
01:03:59,360 --> 01:03:59,840
Take it

1196
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:01,560
Come, let's go

1197
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:03,760
Come on, all of you

1198
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:05,280
Sir...

1199
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:07,320
- Dilli Babu got arrested
- What?

1200
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:08,720
He has our hard disk

1201
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:11,480
So this is the awesome
plan you always talk of?

1202
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:15,720
No Sakkara, I have something even
more awesome matter in my hands

1203
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:16,360
Really?

1204
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:18,280
How did it happen?

1205
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:20,360
Some new guy, gave him
a run for his money

1206
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:22,760
He laughed at you once
and here we are, in cuffs

1207
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:24,560
Look! He's still laughing at you, boss

1208
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:30,640
Remember, he must die only at our hands!

1209
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:34,280
By the way, what's his name?

1210
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:36,320
They said his name is Manickam

1211
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,200
They have thrashed you so bad...

1212
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:46,160
even a cat would leap to save it's life

1213
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:48,640
You have never even raised hands on anyone

1214
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:50,800
Won't you ever get angry?

1215
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:05,760
A tiny fellow!

1216
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:06,840
He is all over the place!

1217
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:08,520
Top notch!

1218
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,360
What a daring boy!

1219
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:11,920
He shook the whole world!

1220
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:28,280
Welcome back after a short commercial break

1221
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:32,640
For some people their own
words are their enemies

1222
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:35,240
But in the case of our
special guest today...

1223
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:36,680
his life is his enemy

1224
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:39,120
Well, let's hear out more
interesting things...

1225
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:40,000
No...

1226
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:42,400
Let's hear about more stranger
things in Gandhi's life

1227
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:43,840
So, let's get back to the show

1228
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,480
Tell me! Who are you?

1229
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:47,040
What business do you have in that place?

1230
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:49,360
Sir, I work in an IT company

1231
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:52,120
My childhood friend went missing

1232
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:54,280
So we booked a cab to
go lodge a complaint

1233
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:56,040
- Dad, dip it in the milk and feed me
- Ok, dear

1234
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:56,600
Sir...

1235
01:05:57,360 --> 01:06:00,000
we got into the wrong car
and ended up in that place

1236
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:02,360
Sir, the main guy over there;
his name is also Dilli Babu

1237
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:03,400
Sir...

1238
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:05,920
my missing friend's name is also Dilli Babu

1239
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:07,760
Yes, sir. Hence the confusion

1240
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,320
Someone else took the cab that
we were suppose to ride in

1241
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:13,440
Must slap myself with a crappy footwear
for believing he's a gangster!

1242
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:14,080
Here, take it

1243
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:16,760
Don't panic, drink it!

1244
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:19,720
Careful. Don't choke yourself

1245
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:20,840
Don't disturb the hair gel

1246
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:23,040
Do you need all this in this age?

1247
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:24,640
You often say that you feel giddy

1248
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:27,080
You have so many medical issues
and you want to be a gangster?

1249
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:28,480
Shall I tell you something?

1250
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:31,920
I wasn't a thug earlier

1251
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,480
You are not a thug even now

1252
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:35,320
I have been growing
long hair for 3 years

1253
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:37,160
- Isn't it part of a thug life?
- No

1254
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:37,920
Fine, forget it

1255
01:06:38,520 --> 01:06:40,600
Myself and boss Sakkara
hail from the same native

1256
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:44,880
I was running a Parotta outlet in
Pookuvaampatti near Coimbatore

1257
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:45,880
Kuvaa?

1258
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:49,160
Don't spoil my village's
name by pronouncing it wrong

1259
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:51,320
Even if 100 people come
from Pookuvaampatti...

1260
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:53,760
I will single handedly wield it

1261
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:54,280
Wield what?

1262
01:06:54,360 --> 01:06:55,280
Of course the Parotta bread

1263
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:58,920
Boss Sakkara loaned me money seeing
my style of preparing the batter

1264
01:06:59,040 --> 01:07:01,560
It is to repay that loan along
with interest, I joined under him

1265
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:04,560
Have you pledged your
hotel or house to him?

1266
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:06,640
If I had that much why would
I loan amount from him

1267
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:08,040
Does he have any empty bond
paper with your sign on it?

1268
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:09,440
Do I look like a fool to you?

1269
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:12,600
Don't I know that one must not
sign in an empty bond paper?

1270
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:14,240
You are indeed a fool!

1271
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:17,400
Then why are you working under him.
Can't you go settle down?

1272
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:18,280
Look here Nelson!

1273
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:23,920
The whole world knows that Pookuvaampatti
people live by their words!

1274
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:25,800
Your village won't even be
visible in the world map!

1275
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:27,320
Stop barking like a mad dog!

1276
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:29,320
- Am I the one barking?
- Of course it's you!

1277
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:31,080
Look at him! Come here

1278
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:32,760
Hear me out carefully

1279
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:35,000
If Dilli Babu gang catches
us, we will be dead meat!

1280
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:37,120
We didn't complete the
job Sakkara assigned us

1281
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:38,240
Sakkara?

1282
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:39,920
Did you just disrespect Sakkara?

1283
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,240
Shut up! I am telling you that
Sakkara will finish us both!

1284
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:42,880
Dude...

1285
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:45,360
The call saved you

1286
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:47,840
It's our boss. Wait, I'll tell him!

1287
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:48,600
Look here...

1288
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:51,440
'Collection' Shekar is going to
collect 5 million from a party

1289
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:56,280
If we follow him and rob
him of that 5 million...

1290
01:07:56,560 --> 01:07:59,200
even if we die there will be a
meaning for all the risk that we took

1291
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,840
5 million! Two shares, one
for you and one share for me

1292
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:03,920
Correct!

1293
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:06,160
With that I can clear my debts, right?

1294
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:07,760
Crazy fellow!

1295
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:09,200
I won't repeat, I'll slap you

1296
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:11,400
5 million. Take your share
and go settle down somewhere

1297
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:12,160
Brother...

1298
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:14,120
Come, let's make a plan to rob Shekar

1299
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:15,640
Shekar...

1300
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:18,880
is all the welcoming party
ready for darling Gandhi?

1301
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,240
All set as per your orders, boss

1302
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:21,600
Superb!

1303
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:24,360
Why such a big build up for this fellow?

1304
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:25,320
Fool!

1305
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:28,440
Will you laugh if Dilli Babu
points a gun on your head?

1306
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:29,120
God!

1307
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:32,160
Will you laugh if Dilli Babu
points a gun on your head?

1308
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:32,720
Boss...

1309
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:35,440
Will you laugh if Dilli Babu
points a gun on your head?

1310
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:37,080
That's really difficult, boss

1311
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:39,040
You know, right?

1312
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:40,360
You know it's difficult, right?

1313
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:43,040
This fellow has looked in to
the gun and laughed heartily

1314
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:45,920
Garland is too less. Even erecting his
statue will fall short of praises

1315
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:53,640
I wouldn't have been this
happier if Dilli Babu had died

1316
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:56,800
Dilli Babu was insulted!

1317
01:08:56,920 --> 01:09:01,160
I shall pour moire oil into that
insult, set a wick and light it up!

1318
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:03,160
Hit it!

1319
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:39,440
What a grace you got when you laugh!

1320
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:41,280
You laughter is going to take you places!

1321
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,560
- Tell me
- Boss...

1322
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:57,600
I beat Ravi to pulp and got the truth out

1323
01:09:57,840 --> 01:09:59,840
He has handed over the
hard disk to Sakkara Das

1324
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:04,480
Sakkara Das is making a deal with the
minister to finish you off inside the prison

1325
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:07,720
- Did you inquire properly?
- Yes, boss!

1326
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:10,400
Those 3 guy who came that day,
all that was a total confusion

1327
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:12,800
The 2 men whom Sakkara Das
sent the other day...

1328
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:14,160
Finish them off!

1329
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:15,320
Boss, that hard disk?

1330
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:18,000
Hard disk, my foot! Forget about it

1331
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:20,520
Nab that guy who kept laughing at me!

1332
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:22,560
I want to finish him off
with my hands! Got it?

1333
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:23,120
Ok, boss!

1334
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:33,280
Mr. Minister! Stop beating around the bush!

1335
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:36,560
Told you! Finish off Dilli Babu first...

1336
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:38,920
then I shall hand over
you the hard disk. Ok?

1337
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:41,880
(The subscriber you have called
in speaking to someone else)

1338
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:45,600
Sakkara, Dilli Babu is calling me...

1339
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:47,520
Dilli Babu?

1340
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:51,000
Minister, I can't trust you.
After you are a pollutician...

1341
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:53,920
Attend his call and put me in a
conference call. I shall quietly listen

1342
01:10:57,880 --> 01:11:00,080
- Tell me, Dilli
- What's up? Where are you?

1343
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:01,000
At home

1344
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:09,920
What's up, Sakkara? How have you been?

1345
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:14,240
If you want to eavesdrop
in a conference call...

1346
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:16,320
the first thing you must do
is put your phone in mute!

1347
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:19,680
Mr. Thangadurai, did he lick you feet?

1348
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:22,360
- Or did you...
- Shut up! Don't you go over board!

1349
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:25,120
Do you think our politics
run on your behest?

1350
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:27,520
Remember this Dilli...

1351
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:28,800
You are just a number for me

1352
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:30,400
I have 10 Dillis like you under me

1353
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:33,120
Minister! Sorry for the interruption

1354
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:35,880
Why do you need 10 Dilli?
Isn't 1 Sakkara enough?

1355
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:39,240
Sakkara will be only worth
serving you tea and coffee

1356
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:41,200
You can't finish off your
enemies, Thangadurai!

1357
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:45,000
Doofus! Did someone train in you
in prison on stand up comedy?

1358
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:47,040
There! You got it right!

1359
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:50,720
Is that how you ended up making
that little kiddo laugh at you?

1360
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,240
I can see you confidence raise
as I am inside the prison!

1361
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:56,080
I am not talking too much
in fact it's very less

1362
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:58,040
Let me tell you what the
word is talking about

1363
01:11:58,200 --> 01:12:00,680
"Look at Dilli Babu and laugh non stop!"

1364
01:12:01,240 --> 01:12:02,280
Now in a kid's voice

1365
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:06,320
"Look at Dilli Babu and laugh non stop!"

1366
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:09,320
How dare you? I'll finish you both
off the moment I step out of prison!

1367
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:11,800
Shut up you fool! Hang up now!

1368
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:13,560
Stop boring us!

1369
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:17,280
Shameless mongrel!

1370
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:18,680
I'll take care of you soon!

1371
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:20,160
Wait and watch!

1372
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:25,280
You mongrels! Why are you laughing?
That too looking over here!

1373
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:27,240
Boss, we were laughing
over something else

1374
01:12:27,320 --> 01:12:29,320
In that case, look away and laugh!

1375
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:31,000
- Ok, boss!
- Or else I'll finish you off!

1376
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:38,000
First, ensure Dilli Babu is finished off!

1377
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:39,840
Once we get the hard disk...

1378
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:42,080
- then order Sakkara also to be finished off!
- Ok, sir

1379
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:44,360
Give me this hard disk
once Dilli Babu is dead

1380
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:46,520
- Then we'll hand it over to the minister
- Ok, boss

1381
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:14,640
Dear...

1382
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:15,480
Darling

1383
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:16,520
My baby

1384
01:13:17,080 --> 01:13:17,920
Apple of my eye

1385
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:19,920
I will say something...

1386
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:22,040
You must not think I'm advising you

1387
01:13:22,120 --> 01:13:24,000
- That means it's an advice. Tell me
- Dear...

1388
01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:26,360
have you ever been in a plane?

1389
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:27,400
No, dad

1390
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:29,360
In a flight journey...

1391
01:13:29,800 --> 01:13:33,000
every passenger has an
individual oxygen mask assigned

1392
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:35,480
So that in case of any emergency...

1393
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:38,320
"First help yourself with the oxygen mask"

1394
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:41,600
"Then help your co-passengers"

1395
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:42,920
That's how they announce it

1396
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,080
Same goes for our lives

1397
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:46,680
First, if you take care of yourself...

1398
01:13:47,480 --> 01:13:50,440
the you may take good care
of everyone around you

1399
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:51,720
Dad...

1400
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:54,280
have you ever been in a plane?

1401
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:55,280
No dear

1402
01:14:02,440 --> 01:14:04,400
Stop playing with the phone all the time!

1403
01:14:05,080 --> 01:14:08,000
- Save my son, Lord Veerabhadra!
- Stop scolding him all the time

1404
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:09,880
Darling, it's ok. You don't mind her

1405
01:14:10,040 --> 01:14:11,480
Can't you even apply
the ash properly?

1406
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:13,240
You applied it like applying
calcium sulphate on a wall!

1407
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:13,920
What if it hurts his eyes?

1408
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:16,000
Gandhi, we have an
important meeting tomorrow

1409
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:16,600
Be there

1410
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:18,600
Patel sir himself has sent me a message!

1411
01:14:19,720 --> 01:14:22,640
Sir, usually don't we send
an email for such things?

1412
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:25,280
- Will you tell or should I do it?
- Sir, it'll be insulting

1413
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:27,160
- Really?
- Yes, sir

1414
01:14:27,240 --> 01:14:28,600
Then I shall do it

1415
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:30,200
Listen up, guys...

1416
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:34,760
We are going to fire a few employees today

1417
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:38,440
Remember, I told you! It's you!

1418
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:42,600
Why are you laughing like you
are going to receive sweet?

1419
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:43,920
Gandhi, can you step forward?

1420
01:14:46,160 --> 01:14:48,000
Does he think this a
bride choosing ceremony?

1421
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:54,000
Our company has had the history of
excellence for the past 25 years

1422
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:56,200
There are 10 engineers in every
street, who are unemployed

1423
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:58,240
No matter what, don't laugh Gandhi!

1424
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:03,560
I don't need employees who punch 'In time'
and while away time waiting for 'Lunch time'

1425
01:15:04,360 --> 01:15:06,760
Uh-oh! I must some how control myself!

1426
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:12,800
Only a good employee can be a
good resource for the company

1427
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:17,720
- Everyone's eyes are on me!
- Look at all the resumes here

1428
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:20,080
It is all a big fat lie!

1429
01:15:20,240 --> 01:15:21,640
Is there a single fact in it?

1430
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:24,520
- Come on, tell me
- If there was a fact, why would we work under you?

1431
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:26,120
We have a book of rules

1432
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:29,720
If even he basic criteria is not met...

1433
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:32,560
then we don't need such
employees for the company!

1434
01:15:34,360 --> 01:15:35,480
What the hell is he doing?

1435
01:15:35,640 --> 01:15:37,280
Sir, book of rules

1436
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:39,520
You only told, sir. Hence proved!

1437
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:40,040
Shut up!

1438
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:42,840
Gandhi!

1439
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,560
You are fired!

1440
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:51,080
He just fired me!

1441
01:15:52,200 --> 01:15:53,640
Are you joking?

1442
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:55,080
Why are you laughing?

1443
01:15:55,160 --> 01:15:56,720
So I'm fired for real, sir?

1444
01:15:57,480 --> 01:15:59,080
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

1445
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:00,320
Why should I be, sir?

1446
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:02,880
- Sir, it's so embarrassing!
- Manoj, ask him to get out!

1447
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,280
Sir, let me tell you something...

1448
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:07,480
I am so saddened by the fact
that I must leave you all

1449
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:10,240
Get lost!

1450
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:10,920
Get out!

1451
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:11,480
Bye!

1452
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:14,360
Sir!

1453
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:17,120
Our company's award fell down!

1454
01:16:18,760 --> 01:16:19,640
I am sorry!

1455
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:21,000
Bye!

1456
01:16:22,720 --> 01:16:24,680
You! I can understand others laughing.
Why are you laughing?

1457
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:27,280
Sir, when you said our company
is a reputed company...

1458
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:28,440
he stuffed his mouth!

1459
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:30,880
So that he can prevent
himself from laughing

1460
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:32,480
Everyone, get back to work!

1461
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:33,440
Sorry, sir. Sorry

1462
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:36,480
Sir, please don't mistake

1463
01:16:45,480 --> 01:16:47,080
Dude, that was some awesome mocking!

1464
01:16:58,280 --> 01:16:59,280
Hop on

1465
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:06,440
- Gandhi
- Dad?

1466
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:08,000
Why are you upset?

1467
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:11,040
- I got fired, dad
- You got fired?

1468
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:13,400
Thought I'll be shocked like that?

1469
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:14,880
It's after all a job

1470
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:16,320
You don't lose your life!

1471
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:20,720
So what if you lost an IT job. Run
a tea stall in the IT corridor

1472
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:23,720
A tea shop owner earns more
than all of you in IT company

1473
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:24,440
Got it?

1474
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:25,920
Take daddy for example

1475
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:27,680
I was a bus driver

1476
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:29,240
Suddenly I lost my job

1477
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:31,440
Didn't I become an ambulance driver?

1478
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:34,040
What job do we do doesn't matter, Gandhi

1479
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:39,840
What matters is that job we do must
make us happy and keep us at peace

1480
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:41,080
Stop crying

1481
01:17:42,160 --> 01:17:45,600
Well not just that, dad.
Ankita is pretty upset with me

1482
01:17:46,240 --> 01:17:48,840
I though I shall convince her somehow

1483
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:50,640
But now that I lost my job...

1484
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,720
That's it! Already her dad
is against our relationship

1485
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,080
My love life is over, dad

1486
01:17:57,760 --> 01:18:00,200
Dad, middle class boys like me...

1487
01:18:00,720 --> 01:18:02,240
can't afford to fall in love, right?

1488
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:04,800
Looks like he is too serious about her

1489
01:18:05,320 --> 01:18:06,440
Is that all?

1490
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:07,840
Come

1491
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:09,120
What is it, dad?

1492
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:11,720
Dad!

1493
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:13,680
Why did you bring me to Anki's home?

1494
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:14,480
Call her out

1495
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:15,400
Call her

1496
01:18:16,040 --> 01:18:16,840
I said, call her

1497
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:18,680
Anki...

1498
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:20,600
Anki...

1499
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:21,360
And then what?

1500
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:23,920
Stop being a wuss!

1501
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:26,360
- Anki!
- Dad! Dad!

1502
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:28,080
Ankita!

1503
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:29,240
Dad, please no!

1504
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:30,160
Ankita!

1505
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:31,880
Who is that at this hour?

1506
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:37,920
Greetings, sir

1507
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:40,000
Why are you here?

1508
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:40,560
Sir...

1509
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:43,680
Let's put aside the past.
Please don't mistake us

1510
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:45,240
It's my fault, forgive me

1511
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:48,040
My son is suffering a lot
without your daughter's love

1512
01:18:48,680 --> 01:18:50,880
Youths, they fell in love with each other

1513
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:52,520
It's us the elders who
must give up our ego

1514
01:18:52,720 --> 01:18:55,840
Your son isn't suitable for my daughter.
We have fixed another alliance, Leave!

1515
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,280
Sir! Sir!

1516
01:18:57,680 --> 01:18:59,680
Please, sir. It's their life

1517
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,240
Please have some consideration

1518
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:03,880
- Please dad. Spare a thought for us
- Shut up!

1519
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:06,080
I made this decision after a
giving it a good thought!

1520
01:19:06,160 --> 01:19:08,720
If I marry off my daughter to
your son, imagine her life!

1521
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:11,080
She will be fine. I swear,
she'll have a great life!

1522
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:13,440
My son is first person stand
up for people's problems

1523
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:15,840
So imagine how he much he'll
take care of his wife!

1524
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:20,080
He'll take care? How? With what?

1525
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,280
Minimum 3 bhk?

1526
01:19:23,480 --> 01:19:24,440
Does he own a car?

1527
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:26,320
At least a salary of Rs. 100,000?

1528
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:27,400
And you say he'll take care of her?

1529
01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:29,000
Your hurting them pa!

1530
01:19:29,160 --> 01:19:32,080
So you won't marry you daughter to a
middle class boy without all these?

1531
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:33,720
Yes, I won't. Get out!

1532
01:19:34,160 --> 01:19:34,880
Confirm?

1533
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:37,360
Confirm it seems

1534
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:40,160
Excuse me!

1535
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:42,160
Listen to me you
'Donald Duck' face!

1536
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:46,600
How much more should I play humble?

1537
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:49,280
What did you ask?

1538
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:52,280
3 bhk, 1 car...

1539
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:54,760
and a salary of Rs. 100,000?

1540
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:57,800
How about a wedding in
the middle of an ocean?

1541
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,360
How about the groom arrives in
a helicopter for the wedding

1542
01:20:00,440 --> 01:20:03,000
A new dress everyday. 365 dress a year

1543
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:04,640
Keep demanding!

1544
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:08,320
If the same thing the groom's family demands?
You'll call it dowry and press charges!

1545
01:20:09,480 --> 01:20:13,000
What do you call these
demands that you are making?

1546
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:16,120
Gandhi, wipe it!

1547
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:17,400
Dad, already spat and did it

1548
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:18,240
Get that!

1549
01:20:19,240 --> 01:20:22,120
Fine, forget all this. What did
you have when you got married?

1550
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:23,400
Tell me

1551
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:25,000
Tell me!

1552
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:27,280
Right! Like he had a lot!

1553
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:28,640
It was all dowry from my parents

1554
01:20:29,080 --> 01:20:29,760
Shut up!

1555
01:20:32,760 --> 01:20:34,920
Dear Ankita, you're helpless

1556
01:20:35,240 --> 01:20:36,560
You must obey your father

1557
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:39,120
You guys easily call off a relationship

1558
01:20:39,880 --> 01:20:42,080
Boys don't vent out their feelings

1559
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:45,320
The keep all the feelings within and...

1560
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:47,560
Look he's crying. Don't cry, dear

1561
01:20:47,640 --> 01:20:48,760
Please dear, don't cry

1562
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:51,000
Don't laugh and play spoilsport!

1563
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:52,400
My baby

1564
01:20:52,680 --> 01:20:55,000
Everyone's making my son suffer a lot

1565
01:20:55,800 --> 01:20:56,280
Sir!

1566
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,520
- Don't see what are the boy's possession
- Whoa! Here comes the punch dialogue!

1567
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:01,600
See to that the boy is genuine and kind

1568
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:07,520
- Stop it!
- Dad!

1569
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:08,520
Who's that?

1570
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,480
- Dear! What's going on?
- Gandhi!

1571
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:12,040
Stop it!

1572
01:21:12,760 --> 01:21:13,240
Excuse me!

1573
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:16,920
We promised we'll repay the money! Then
why are they breaking stuffs. Stop it!

1574
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:17,520
Just a minute

1575
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:20,520
Stay quiet and only house
hold stuffs will break

1576
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,600
- Or else you're head will also break!
-  Sir, please!

1577
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:25,440
- Sir!
- Anki! No!

1578
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:57,280
Sir!

1579
01:21:57,640 --> 01:21:58,760
Do you know him?

1580
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:01,000
How are you related to him?

1581
01:22:01,720 --> 01:22:03,080
His son-in-law

1582
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:05,000
Dad, quiet!

1583
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:05,680
Really?

1584
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:07,680
Say yes!

1585
01:22:07,880 --> 01:22:08,680
Stop thinking!

1586
01:22:09,080 --> 01:22:10,720
Just stop thinking and say yes!

1587
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:11,440
Yes

1588
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:15,080
Oh! Come on, sir. You should have
told us that he is your son-in-law

1589
01:22:15,640 --> 01:22:17,560
Guys, stop it! Stop!

1590
01:22:18,040 --> 01:22:18,520
Stop it!

1591
01:22:21,480 --> 01:22:22,400
Tell me, Shekar

1592
01:22:22,760 --> 01:22:24,560
Boss, I came to collect the money

1593
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:27,360
The concerned party is
Gandhi's father-in-law

1594
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:29,000
Gandhi's father-in-law?

1595
01:22:29,080 --> 01:22:30,840
- Put the call on speaker mode
- Sure, boss

1596
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:32,760
Sir, greetings

1597
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,840
If you had given me a hint that
you are Gandhi's father-in-law...

1598
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,600
I wouldn't have sent
my men to you home!

1599
01:22:37,680 --> 01:22:39,040
He is great guy!

1600
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:41,640
Widen you chest. More!

1601
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:45,280
- But why dad?
- Or else they'll finish all of us!

1602
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:49,760
Having the documents of such a guy's
father-in-law with me is insulting for my image

1603
01:22:50,080 --> 01:22:51,920
I shall courier your documents tomorrow

1604
01:22:52,040 --> 01:22:54,240
Just sign it, ok?

1605
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:54,800
Sir...

1606
01:22:55,560 --> 01:22:57,520
I couldn't repay because
the interest was too much

1607
01:22:58,040 --> 01:23:00,000
Along with the principle
we'll return the 2 million

1608
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:01,400
We don't need your money, sir

1609
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:02,720
Come on, sir

1610
01:23:03,080 --> 01:23:04,280
Ok, as you wish

1611
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:06,360
Sir, put Shekar on the line

1612
01:23:08,120 --> 01:23:08,600
Ok, boss

1613
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:10,000
I shall say that

1614
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:12,520
Sir, return the money when you can

1615
01:23:12,680 --> 01:23:13,160
Sir! Sir!

1616
01:23:13,640 --> 01:23:15,120
I shall repay it tomorrow

1617
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:17,000
Sir, come on. Don't be so innocent

1618
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:18,000
Gandhi!

1619
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:19,480
Put your arms around her shoulder

1620
01:23:19,560 --> 01:23:20,520
- Why?
- Just do it!

1621
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:22,880
- No need, dad
- He'll marry her off to someone else

1622
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:27,400
Ankita...

1623
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:30,200
It's ok. Let it be

1624
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:32,560
Sir...

1625
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:34,520
your scooter is damaged

1626
01:23:35,320 --> 01:23:36,360
I shall repair it

1627
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:38,240
Dear, you drop them home

1628
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:40,200
On the way back, have dinner at...

1629
01:23:40,440 --> 01:23:43,200
- what's that multicuisine restaurant at Adyar?
- Sir...

1630
01:23:43,480 --> 01:23:48,080
Sir, what you spend on 3 people at a 5 star
hotel is a feast for 30 people in our hood

1631
01:23:48,280 --> 01:23:51,520
She's coming as my daughter-in-law to our
locality for the first time. Come on, sir!

1632
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:23,760
"Rice cake with fish gravy
is the best combo as you and me!"

1633
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:27,120
"You are important to me
like how a salad is nothing without the broccoli"

1634
01:24:27,680 --> 01:24:30,840
"There are many such flavors of love,
shall I show them all to you?"

1635
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:34,600
"How about I feed some love too?"

1636
01:24:34,920 --> 01:24:38,680
"Instead of sitting inside
and just being formal"

1637
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:42,000
"Step down and check out
the local flavours"

1638
01:24:42,040 --> 01:24:45,440
"Our leader, Gandhi's smile can
be found in the currency note"

1639
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:49,560
"Our boy Gandhi's smile can be
found in your heart's beat"

1640
01:24:49,640 --> 01:24:52,840
"Our leader, Gandhi's smile can
be found in the currency note"

1641
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:56,800
"Our boy Gandhi's smile can be
found in your heart's beat"

1642
01:25:21,400 --> 01:25:24,840
"Welcome to my hood and meet
my people, who raised me"

1643
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:28,400
"Here they are, to meet the
girl who swept me of my feet"

1644
01:25:28,600 --> 01:25:32,200
"Please meet the juniors of my hood"

1645
01:25:32,240 --> 01:25:35,840
"They too are here to meet
the one who stole my heart"

1646
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:39,400
"My good time that I found my love"

1647
01:25:39,480 --> 01:25:43,320
"I am so excited that I
am singing and dancing"

1648
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:51,000
"A flying kiss from her drove me crazy"

1649
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:11,400
"Millions of soap bubbles and nostalgia"

1650
01:26:11,480 --> 01:26:15,000
"The nostalgia in it is my
baby's face that I see in it"

1651
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:18,760
"Come, let me take you
on this colorful ride"

1652
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:22,560
"We shall dine and have dessert at
the famous outlets by the seashore"

1653
01:26:22,640 --> 01:26:25,840
"He is the king of laughter and
she is the queen of beauty"

1654
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:29,640
"Love has sparked between them
and nothing can separate them"

1655
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:36,760
"You are mine forever"

1656
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:40,680
"Our leader, Gandhi's smile can
be found in the currency note"

1657
01:26:40,760 --> 01:26:44,600
"Our boy Gandhi's smile can be
found in your heart's beat"

1658
01:26:44,840 --> 01:26:48,120
"Our leader, Gandhi's smile can
be found in the currency note"

1659
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:52,160
"Our boy Gandhi's smile can be
found in your heart's beat"

1660
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:14,320
Dude, our friend Dillibabu has
posted a suicide note status

1661
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:15,040
Yes!

1662
01:27:15,320 --> 01:27:18,160
My friend Dillibabu has posted
that he is going to commit suicide

1663
01:27:18,240 --> 01:27:20,440
Mani, Dillibabu wants to
commit suicide it seems

1664
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:23,040
- Let's get him before he does something crazy
- Come on!

1665
01:27:28,200 --> 01:27:29,520
Anki, careful with the money

1666
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:31,280
I'll send you the location. Be there

1667
01:27:31,480 --> 01:27:32,520
I am on my way

1668
01:27:32,920 --> 01:27:34,320
Inform that finance person too

1669
01:27:34,520 --> 01:27:37,200
Ok. Mom, I'm stepping out. Bye

1670
01:27:37,320 --> 01:27:39,240
Don't say 'Bye'.  Say 'See you'

1671
01:27:39,720 --> 01:27:41,120
How many times should I tell him!

1672
01:27:41,560 --> 01:27:43,040
Lord, save us all

1673
01:27:43,240 --> 01:27:45,880
Famous gangster Dilli Babu who
was arrested an Panmai...

1674
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,320
attacked the police and
broke out from prison

1675
01:27:48,440 --> 01:27:51,680
The police has set up a
force to hunt him down

1676
01:27:52,920 --> 01:27:55,400
I'm standing right opposite to the
shop you told me. Make it fast

1677
01:27:56,600 --> 01:27:58,000
- Shekar
- Where?

1678
01:27:58,800 --> 01:27:59,280
Indeed him!

1679
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:01,600
- Let's go inside
- Screw up and I'll finish you off!

1680
01:28:01,800 --> 01:28:02,520
Lets go in first

1681
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:04,520
These guys look familiar

1682
01:28:06,120 --> 01:28:07,080
It's indeed them!

1683
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:11,040
Perumal boss, it's me Papa

1684
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:12,480
Remember the photo you
sent me other day?

1685
01:28:12,680 --> 01:28:14,800
I just saw those guys entering
a gift shop in Anna Nagar

1686
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:15,360
Who?

1687
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:17,200
Those guys who laughed at our boss?

1688
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:20,360
Not them, the photo of Sakkara's men
and were meant to come that day

1689
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:21,200
Those guys!

1690
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:23,480
Sakkara Das' men

1691
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:28,440
- Keep an eye on them, I'll be there
- On it, boss

1692
01:28:30,120 --> 01:28:31,440
You, one more tea!

1693
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,360
Let me see how they can
escape my eagle eyes!

1694
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:36,880
Nelson...

1695
01:28:40,720 --> 01:28:41,560
it's so nice. Buy  me one

1696
01:28:41,680 --> 01:28:44,120
- Fool! Stop acting like a kid
- Forget it!

1697
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:51,400
Sorry, it was an accident

1698
01:28:51,560 --> 01:28:52,480
I am very sorry

1699
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:54,560
What are they doing for so long inside?

1700
01:28:54,680 --> 01:28:56,520
He owes us Rs. 3000

1701
01:28:56,680 --> 01:28:58,680
He'll wait meanwhile he'll
get the cash from the ATM

1702
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:00,840
I'll be back after lunch.
You take care of the shop

1703
01:29:01,320 --> 01:29:03,160
Please do come back.
Please have trust on us!

1704
01:29:03,400 --> 01:29:04,920
What's the ATM pin? 3550?

1705
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:05,680
It's 5035

1706
01:29:05,880 --> 01:29:07,520
- 5035! 5035!
- You!

1707
01:29:08,080 --> 01:29:09,120
Are you nuts?

1708
01:29:09,480 --> 01:29:10,520
Don't we have a gun?

1709
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:12,480
Indeed, will it compensate for Rs. 3000?

1710
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:15,040
Don't make me raise hands on you!

1711
01:29:15,160 --> 01:29:16,760
Use this to threaten! Got it?

1712
01:29:17,200 --> 01:29:17,680
Go!

1713
01:29:18,200 --> 01:29:20,920
- This shop, right?
- Yes

1714
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:22,280
Do you have egg fritters?

1715
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:24,400
You want me to pay up Rs. 3000?

1716
01:29:27,480 --> 01:29:28,000
Excuse me

1717
01:29:29,240 --> 01:29:30,920
Do you know anyone called Priya?

1718
01:29:31,360 --> 01:29:33,160
Anyone called Priya working here?

1719
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:35,240
Are you all Dillibabu's friends?

1720
01:29:36,680 --> 01:29:38,800
Yes. We have been looking
for him for the past 3 days

1721
01:29:39,200 --> 01:29:40,920
Did I just hear the name Dilli Babu?

1722
01:29:41,200 --> 01:29:42,000
Give it to me, sir

1723
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:45,400
Shymala...

1724
01:29:46,080 --> 01:29:47,080
how much for the metallic gun?

1725
01:29:47,200 --> 01:29:48,200
It's Rs. 300

1726
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:51,040
Priya works here

1727
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:53,480
She said things didn't
work out with Dillibabu

1728
01:29:53,560 --> 01:29:55,200
I asked her why...

1729
01:29:55,320 --> 01:29:57,040
and she said 'No means no!'

1730
01:29:57,360 --> 01:29:59,840
She said he didn't earn enough

1731
01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:02,720
She spoke as if she didn't knew
all these facts about him earlier

1732
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:05,200
It was me who gave him
Priya's wedding invitation

1733
01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:08,400
- Priya is getting married?
- Why are these guys looking for Dilli Babu?

1734
01:30:08,840 --> 01:30:10,160
Where is wedding? Any idea?

1735
01:30:10,520 --> 01:30:12,520
Somewhere in Ulundurpettai

1736
01:30:12,720 --> 01:30:14,360
I think it's KRK Mahal

1737
01:30:14,440 --> 01:30:15,560
Assumptions won't work out

1738
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:16,840
Give us the detailed address

1739
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:19,240
Wait, first let me
attend to the customer

1740
01:30:19,560 --> 01:30:20,040
Excuse me...

1741
01:30:20,840 --> 01:30:22,320
That was embarrassing!

1742
01:30:22,680 --> 01:30:23,400
Shut up!

1743
01:30:25,320 --> 01:30:26,640
Why did that girl become upset?

1744
01:30:26,680 --> 01:30:29,080
- Anki...
- That's it he won't mind us now

1745
01:30:29,120 --> 01:30:30,800
- Hi
- Hi

1746
01:30:30,920 --> 01:30:34,160
That guy is waiting right opposite to this
shop. Shall we go and hand him the money?

1747
01:30:34,240 --> 01:30:37,000
Not good to deal money in the open road.
Call and ask him to come here

1748
01:30:40,360 --> 01:30:42,680
These guys look quite familiar

1749
01:30:43,080 --> 01:30:45,000
Where have I seen them?

1750
01:30:45,800 --> 01:30:47,280
Sir, birthday?

1751
01:30:51,080 --> 01:30:52,760
Birthday! Correct!

1752
01:30:53,080 --> 01:30:53,560
Ok, sir

1753
01:30:54,440 --> 01:30:56,040
Sir, Rs. 300

1754
01:30:56,120 --> 01:30:56,600
Rs. 300?

1755
01:30:56,880 --> 01:30:57,360
Yes, sir

1756
01:30:57,640 --> 01:30:59,120
Your owner said Rs. 3000

1757
01:31:00,160 --> 01:31:01,400
Did my hairstyle intimidate him?

1758
01:31:02,640 --> 01:31:03,120
Cool

1759
01:31:04,240 --> 01:31:04,720
Thank you

1760
01:31:04,920 --> 01:31:05,520
No thanks!

1761
01:31:05,560 --> 01:31:08,600
- Let's head to KRK hall at Ulundurpettai!
- We must! We will!

1762
01:31:08,640 --> 01:31:10,760
- And we'll nab Dillibabu!
- Yes! We will!

1763
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:12,360
Nab Dilli Babu?

1764
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:14,400
- He is driving us furious!
- Driving them furious?

1765
01:31:14,760 --> 01:31:15,440
Nelson!

1766
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:18,360
Like us, another group
is chasing Dilli Babu

1767
01:31:18,480 --> 01:31:19,120
Who are they?

1768
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:22,320
- Remember that birthday party..
- Shekar! Shekar!

1769
01:31:25,440 --> 01:31:27,720
The principle on Rs. 2 million is there.
Please check it

1770
01:31:27,800 --> 01:31:28,280
Ok

1771
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:32,240
Ok, boss. See you

1772
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:35,440
Ready for the hunt?

1773
01:31:35,560 --> 01:31:37,520
Meet me, I'm Dora! Where are we headed now?

1774
01:31:37,560 --> 01:31:38,360
Tell me, where?

1775
01:31:38,520 --> 01:31:39,400
- To loot the money!
- Super!

1776
01:31:39,440 --> 01:31:40,040
Shall we?

1777
01:31:44,720 --> 01:31:47,000
Why are you looking into
the bag, you doofus! Look away!

1778
01:31:47,080 --> 01:31:49,360
Let me puncture his bike tyres

1779
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:51,680
Puncture!

1780
01:31:51,800 --> 01:31:53,680
- Give me the bag!
- Please give us the bag!

1781
01:31:53,880 --> 01:31:55,920
Poor fellow, don't beat him too much.
He might faint

1782
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,120
- Come on!
- The money is now ours

1783
01:31:58,440 --> 01:32:00,160
Stop! Stop!

1784
01:32:00,720 --> 01:32:02,200
They just escaped from my eagle eyes!

1785
01:32:04,040 --> 01:32:05,200
- Here
- Thank you

1786
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:13,480
Quick, pick up the call!

1787
01:32:14,280 --> 01:32:14,760
Hello?

1788
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:15,480
Boss!

1789
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:17,840
They ran away! Quick, come to the main road

1790
01:32:19,560 --> 01:32:22,400
Looks like they escaped.
They aren't in there

1791
01:32:24,640 --> 01:32:26,560
Look! It's Perumal!

1792
01:32:27,040 --> 01:32:28,680
- Uh-oh!
- Uh-oh! It's indeed Perumal!

1793
01:32:29,080 --> 01:32:30,360
Run! Run!

1794
01:32:56,120 --> 01:32:57,160
Oh God!

1795
01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:04,760
Whoa! Police! Disperse! Run!

1796
01:33:05,240 --> 01:33:07,480
We slipped again! What
will I tell our boss now?

1797
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:09,280
What happened?

1798
01:33:09,320 --> 01:33:11,320
- Check if they left
- He's checking

1799
01:33:11,720 --> 01:33:13,440
- No one's here. They left!
- No one's here?

1800
01:33:13,640 --> 01:33:14,560
No one's around it seems

1801
01:33:14,600 --> 01:33:16,640
- Come, let's escape!
- Come on! Come on!

1802
01:33:17,480 --> 01:33:19,240
- Dad's ambulance sound!
- Thank God!

1803
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:20,920
They ran away buddy.
Didn't I tell you?

1804
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:21,840
Come on bro

1805
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:23,160
It sounds like
father's ambulance

1806
01:33:23,640 --> 01:33:24,600
Excuse me!

1807
01:33:26,040 --> 01:33:27,840
Did you see that?

1808
01:33:37,080 --> 01:33:39,160
Wow, uncle how come you
came by the right time?

1809
01:33:39,240 --> 01:33:42,000
25 years of experience as
an ambulance driver...

1810
01:33:42,640 --> 01:33:43,720
and as his father too

1811
01:33:47,120 --> 01:33:49,200
Look at him. My
son is all smiles

1812
01:33:49,280 --> 01:33:50,920
Come on. Get into the car

1813
01:33:51,080 --> 01:33:52,400
Get in. Get into the car

1814
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:54,520
Close the door Gandhi

1815
01:33:54,600 --> 01:33:57,560
Gandhi close the door.
Close the door

1816
01:33:57,640 --> 01:33:58,160
Close

1817
01:33:58,200 --> 01:33:59,720
And off we go! There

1818
01:34:07,560 --> 01:34:09,280
BOSS, they escaped

1819
01:34:10,680 --> 01:34:12,000
I took care of the
vehicle's number

1820
01:34:12,120 --> 01:34:12,720
- TN 0
- Stop it

1821
01:34:13,480 --> 01:34:14,000
You tell me

1822
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:16,280
KRK Mahal, Ulundurpettai

1823
01:34:16,480 --> 01:34:18,120
Start the car

1824
01:34:21,480 --> 01:34:22,000
Anbu!

1825
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:24,840
Come to KRK Mahal, Ulundurpettai
along with our brother

1826
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,480
Gandhi is headed there too.
Let's finish him off

1827
01:34:29,640 --> 01:34:30,120
Oh my God

1828
01:34:31,480 --> 01:34:34,400
- Nelson, they are new bank notes
- Keep it inside

1829
01:34:35,160 --> 01:34:37,600
- Why are you so scared?
- Keep your mouth shut, monkey

1830
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:39,880
What is this?

1831
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:44,800
A Powerbank. He will be scared
if I show anything to him

1832
01:34:45,680 --> 01:34:46,400
We will keep it

1833
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:50,600
My body is tired after all the fights

1834
01:34:50,680 --> 01:34:52,800
- Shall we stop for a juice?
- What ?

1835
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:54,840
Let's have Fig juice.
It will be good

1836
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:55,440
Let's drink

1837
01:34:55,880 --> 01:34:57,240
Why is the whole town so quiet?

1838
01:35:00,160 --> 01:35:01,360
Don't pop your head out?

1839
01:35:01,560 --> 01:35:03,440
Headquarters? Head
straight and take a left

1840
01:35:03,720 --> 01:35:06,120
Hey, fool. Beware not
to lose your head

1841
01:35:06,160 --> 01:35:07,480
- No need to say thanks buddy
- Thyagu!

1842
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:09,400
- Why isn't he answering?
- Thyagu

1843
01:35:09,640 --> 01:35:11,160
Thyagu, buddy

1844
01:35:11,240 --> 01:35:12,880
Can't you hear Mani
bro calling you?

1845
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:14,720
They called me to ask for directions.
I helped them

1846
01:35:19,800 --> 01:35:21,200
Why is the town so quiet?

1847
01:35:21,240 --> 01:35:22,280
There is no reaction

1848
01:35:23,200 --> 01:35:23,680
Thyagu

1849
01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:28,360
Buddy, you are bleeding

1850
01:35:28,440 --> 01:35:29,320
Blood?

1851
01:35:30,120 --> 01:35:32,520
Daddy, thyagu is
bleeding from his ears

1852
01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:33,840
Why do you laugh while I bleed?

1853
01:35:33,920 --> 01:35:35,440
You were bleeding, that's why I laughed

1854
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:38,080
We will wipe of the blood. Dillibabu
has updated another status

1855
01:35:41,200 --> 01:35:43,760
Love reminds you of Rose flower

1856
01:35:44,120 --> 01:35:45,040
She...

1857
01:35:45,160 --> 01:35:47,120
She was so beautiful
from the inside...

1858
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:50,000
I kept her in my heart
like a rose flower

1859
01:35:51,080 --> 01:35:51,560
But...

1860
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:52,880
while leaving...

1861
01:35:53,240 --> 01:35:56,120
while leaving it was like
uprooting the entire plant...

1862
01:35:56,400 --> 01:36:02,760
the thorns were all over my body,
wounding me, covering my body with blood

1863
01:36:03,080 --> 01:36:03,800
With that pain...

1864
01:36:05,680 --> 01:36:06,600
I am leaving too...

1865
01:36:06,680 --> 01:36:09,080
Daddy, take us to the
marriage hall now

1866
01:36:09,120 --> 01:36:10,680
Ask him to be quiet.
Look at my driving now

1867
01:36:11,240 --> 01:36:14,640
See how difficult it is to
earn 5 million rupees

1868
01:36:15,760 --> 01:36:18,040
It is too risky to be here.
Let's leave soon

1869
01:36:18,120 --> 01:36:18,680
Is it?

1870
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:23,000
There isn't enough sugar in here.
Bro, add some sugar in this

1871
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:25,920
Hey, it's Sakkarai

1872
01:36:26,040 --> 01:36:27,400
Wait, let me get it first

1873
01:36:27,480 --> 01:36:29,400
Two spoons are enough.
We are going to get it

1874
01:36:29,720 --> 01:36:31,400
The master idiot is here.
Let's manage

1875
01:36:32,680 --> 01:36:33,160
Hey!

1876
01:36:33,640 --> 01:36:35,080
What are you doing here?

1877
01:36:35,160 --> 01:36:36,280
We were searching you
all over the place

1878
01:36:36,360 --> 01:36:37,440
Brother

1879
01:36:38,080 --> 01:36:38,640
It's nothing brother

1880
01:36:39,440 --> 01:36:41,600
He is crying because he
couldn't finish off Dilli babu

1881
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:45,200
How come you are holding
Collection Shekar's bike?

1882
01:36:45,760 --> 01:36:47,920
There were two of them...

1883
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:49,280
escaping fast...

1884
01:36:49,400 --> 01:36:51,880
When inquired we found that the
bag belongs to our company

1885
01:36:52,040 --> 01:36:53,400
Then we assaulted them...

1886
01:36:53,560 --> 01:36:54,640
to recover the bag

1887
01:36:54,800 --> 01:36:57,920
We were about to call you
to return this bag to you

1888
01:36:58,000 --> 01:36:59,920
Now I am here. Give me that

1889
01:37:01,680 --> 01:37:03,240
What did I ask you to do?

1890
01:37:03,400 --> 01:37:05,720
Can't you even attend your phone?

1891
01:37:05,800 --> 01:37:07,600
I will see to you guys. Follow me now

1892
01:37:07,720 --> 01:37:08,800
- Come over
- Come

1893
01:37:10,040 --> 01:37:11,200
Nelson, what about the bike?

1894
01:37:11,280 --> 01:37:12,880
Don't feel sympathetic over
the bike that is not yours

1895
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:14,280
Head to the warehouse

1896
01:37:21,280 --> 01:37:22,120
Shekar

1897
01:37:22,400 --> 01:37:24,280
You useless fool!

1898
01:37:24,360 --> 01:37:27,200
Had these not for these two men, the
money you lost couldn't have been saved

1899
01:37:27,280 --> 01:37:29,000
The irony is your name
is collection Shekar

1900
01:37:29,160 --> 01:37:31,400
I learnt now that you
are the snappy Shekar

1901
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:36,360
Bro, I kept it inside
this bag only.

1902
01:37:36,440 --> 01:37:37,600
The hard disk is missing

1903
01:37:38,200 --> 01:37:40,280
What do you mean?

1904
01:37:40,600 --> 01:37:43,160
- Senior please search properly
- I remember keeping it here,brother

1905
01:37:43,240 --> 01:37:45,400
Is it? It's alright. Please
search one more time

1906
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:47,720
- Bro, its missing
- Oh my God. What will I do now?

1907
01:37:47,800 --> 01:37:51,240
I scolded the minister based on this hard
disk. He won't spare me if gets to know

1908
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:53,000
Any idea?

1909
01:37:53,520 --> 01:37:54,360
Did you guys see the hard disk?

1910
01:37:54,640 --> 01:37:56,560
The person who took the bag must
have taken the hard disk, sir

1911
01:37:56,840 --> 01:37:57,600
That's right

1912
01:37:58,160 --> 01:38:00,000
This seems to be
perfectly planned ordeal

1913
01:38:01,880 --> 01:38:03,440
They were wearing Chotta
Bheem and Dora masks

1914
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:05,280
Where in the city will
I find a Chotta Bheem

1915
01:38:05,320 --> 01:38:05,800
Boss...

1916
01:38:06,200 --> 01:38:08,240
We would find Chotta Bheem in
Dolakhpur said the actress

1917
01:38:09,400 --> 01:38:12,280
It must Dilli Babu's men
who planned the robbery

1918
01:38:13,040 --> 01:38:14,680
Where will the republic
nation could ask for?

1919
01:38:14,760 --> 01:38:17,440
Dilli babu is headed towards
Ulundurpettai KRK Marriage hall

1920
01:38:18,200 --> 01:38:19,880
- How do you know?
- That was!!!

1921
01:38:20,280 --> 01:38:22,000
Why do you cough together?

1922
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:24,080
Minister has started calling me

1923
01:38:25,040 --> 01:38:27,520
How do I talk to him? He talks a lot.

1924
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:33,920
Yes, minister

1925
01:38:34,080 --> 01:38:35,840
Did you kill Dilli Babu?

1926
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:37,160
Did you check the news?

1927
01:38:37,880 --> 01:38:40,560
Dilli has escaped from Jail. He
must be on his way to kill us!

1928
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:42,240
I will track him
down and kill him

1929
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:43,560
Keep the hard disk safe

1930
01:38:43,800 --> 01:38:44,880
Is it safe?

1931
01:38:45,640 --> 01:38:46,800
Sakkara

1932
01:38:47,800 --> 01:38:49,320
If something is to
happen to the hard disk

1933
01:38:49,440 --> 01:38:50,200
I will kill you too

1934
01:38:52,120 --> 01:38:53,280
Why have you gone all silent?

1935
01:38:53,640 --> 01:38:54,480
Be quiet

1936
01:38:54,840 --> 01:38:58,000
Do you know where is Dilli Babu?

1937
01:38:59,120 --> 01:39:01,200
KRK mahal, Ulundur pettai

1938
01:39:01,240 --> 01:39:02,160
How is my update?

1939
01:39:02,200 --> 01:39:05,280
I ask you to move to
KRK Mahal immediately

1940
01:39:05,320 --> 01:39:08,640
Kill Dilli Babu and his remains must
be displayed for public viewing

1941
01:39:08,720 --> 01:39:10,600
Do the job I asked you to? I
will take care of my work

1942
01:39:10,640 --> 01:39:11,120
Ok

1943
01:39:12,160 --> 01:39:13,440
Oh my God!

1944
01:39:13,640 --> 01:39:16,440
He is the ruling party. He
will anything he wishes to do

1945
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:18,400
You are cursed, bloody fool

1946
01:39:18,480 --> 01:39:20,640
They will play with the butt plugs

1947
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:24,560
Pull over daddy. This is the place.
Do not drive into the kitchen

1948
01:39:24,640 --> 01:39:25,920
Get down. Get down dear

1949
01:39:26,040 --> 01:39:28,000
- Get down
- Make way buddy

1950
01:39:28,480 --> 01:39:29,680
Come on buddy

1951
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:43,120
Do stay for the feast

1952
01:39:43,640 --> 01:39:45,000
- Manoj
- Manoj, how come you are here

1953
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:46,360
Welcome Gandhi

1954
01:39:46,840 --> 01:39:48,000
Although I didn't invite you

1955
01:39:48,040 --> 01:39:49,000
You made it to the right place

1956
01:39:49,160 --> 01:39:50,160
Came to the right place?

1957
01:39:50,520 --> 01:39:52,080
This is my sister's wedding

1958
01:39:52,200 --> 01:39:54,280
Look at my sister. She
is an epitome of beauty

1959
01:39:54,480 --> 01:39:55,760
Isn't she an angel?

1960
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:57,520
Did he just swear his sister?

1961
01:39:58,520 --> 01:40:00,160
He called her an angel.
Now come along

1962
01:40:01,320 --> 01:40:03,200
That's my dear sister

1963
01:40:03,440 --> 01:40:04,800
She is an angel from heaven

1964
01:40:05,080 --> 01:40:06,440
An unboxed fresh
doughnut in the oven

1965
01:40:06,640 --> 01:40:08,320
She is the apple of our eyes

1966
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:10,360
The dream girl of all the guys

1967
01:40:12,240 --> 01:40:14,000
- Gandhi, recognize her?
- Oh my God

1968
01:40:14,480 --> 01:40:17,520
Dillibabu has
fallen for this girl

1969
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:22,840
Dillibabu, were you planning
to take your life for her?

1970
01:40:23,400 --> 01:40:24,480
Pity on him

1971
01:40:25,400 --> 01:40:27,000
Come along buddy. Don't feel shy

1972
01:40:27,080 --> 01:40:27,600
Come

1973
01:40:28,880 --> 01:40:29,840
Gandhi

1974
01:40:30,040 --> 01:40:31,280
The groom ...

1975
01:40:31,800 --> 01:40:34,200
did his MS in US and MBA in UK...

1976
01:40:34,280 --> 01:40:38,400
he is a big shot now. Tell me I will get
you a job. You are my friend after all

1977
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:40,440
Mr.Groom... Mr.Groom

1978
01:40:43,800 --> 01:40:45,280
This is Gandhi

1979
01:40:46,840 --> 01:40:47,840
Buddy...

1980
01:40:47,920 --> 01:40:48,520
Buddy...

1981
01:40:48,560 --> 01:40:50,080
Do you know the groom already?

1982
01:40:50,160 --> 01:40:52,480
- Bro, he is my backlogs friend....
- Hey!

1983
01:40:53,480 --> 01:40:55,440
He intends to say that
he is my all time friend

1984
01:40:55,600 --> 01:40:56,280
Buddy!

1985
01:40:56,720 --> 01:40:59,160
For the first time something
good is happening in my life

1986
01:40:59,640 --> 01:41:01,120
A dream girl like her...

1987
01:41:02,440 --> 01:41:04,400
She is a dream girl to me...

1988
01:41:05,120 --> 01:41:06,080
Buddy

1989
01:41:06,520 --> 01:41:09,520
Don't you spoil anything
with this mouth of yours

1990
01:41:10,440 --> 01:41:11,400
Do enjoy the feast

1991
01:41:13,040 --> 01:41:15,040
Lover no 2, the guy who spoiled
our plan in coffee shop...

1992
01:41:15,200 --> 01:41:16,240
has come here too

1993
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:17,280
Where is the thing I asked for?

1994
01:41:17,360 --> 01:41:18,160
- I have it here
- Take it

1995
01:41:18,240 --> 01:41:19,000
Here

1996
01:41:19,640 --> 01:41:21,840
If we make her drink this...

1997
01:41:22,080 --> 01:41:23,040
within 7 seconds...

1998
01:41:23,160 --> 01:41:24,720
her bones will freeze

1999
01:41:25,040 --> 01:41:26,320
within the next 18 seconds...

2000
01:41:26,720 --> 01:41:28,120
her pulse will plummet

2001
01:41:28,560 --> 01:41:29,680
In 20 seconds...

2002
01:41:29,840 --> 01:41:31,520
all her senses will shut down...

2003
01:41:31,920 --> 01:41:33,280
and she will freeze all over

2004
01:41:33,360 --> 01:41:34,680
I will then walk up to her...

2005
01:41:34,760 --> 01:41:36,400
and shout 'Oh my God, My stomach aches'

2006
01:41:36,520 --> 01:41:38,600
I will tease her to my heart's content

2007
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:42,520
Dillibabu has updated
another status

2008
01:41:42,600 --> 01:41:43,480
What's with him

2009
01:41:59,640 --> 01:42:01,320
Won't you attend my call?

2010
01:42:02,640 --> 01:42:04,640
He asks her to attend the call.
She keeps staring at her phone

2011
01:42:04,720 --> 01:42:05,760
It must be Dillibabu who is calling her

2012
01:42:05,840 --> 01:42:07,520
You snatch her phone somehow

2013
01:42:07,680 --> 01:42:08,680
You want me to steal?

2014
01:42:08,760 --> 01:42:10,280
Yeah. Please go and
take her phone

2015
01:42:10,360 --> 01:42:13,760
The crowd looks happy. I guess
Dilli babu hasn't died yet

2016
01:42:13,800 --> 01:42:14,280
Boss

2017
01:42:16,200 --> 01:42:17,440
Dilli is still alive

2018
01:42:18,280 --> 01:42:19,880
The hard disk is still inside, isn't it?

2019
01:42:20,360 --> 01:42:21,800
When Dilli sees me...

2020
01:42:21,880 --> 01:42:23,360
won't he be shocked?

2021
01:42:23,560 --> 01:42:25,680
Of course bro. 200 % sure

2022
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:27,600
That's my boy

2023
01:42:27,680 --> 01:42:29,040
See how confident he is

2024
01:42:29,240 --> 01:42:30,440
We kill him first...

2025
01:42:30,520 --> 01:42:31,880
and we take the hard disk then

2026
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:33,000
Hey!

2027
01:42:34,080 --> 01:42:37,000
How could you see when
your hair is like this?

2028
01:42:37,200 --> 01:42:38,520
Paste your hair this way

2029
01:42:38,600 --> 01:42:40,160
- Come now
- I am coming idiot

2030
01:42:40,240 --> 01:42:41,240
I am in the CCTV room alright

2031
01:42:41,840 --> 01:42:42,800
I am watching them

2032
01:42:42,920 --> 01:42:44,080
Search carefully

2033
01:42:44,160 --> 01:42:45,400
Ok

2034
01:42:46,280 --> 01:42:47,000
What is that sound?

2035
01:42:47,760 --> 01:42:48,880
He keeps doing this

2036
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:52,000
I lost my ears now

2037
01:42:52,080 --> 01:42:53,480
If I catch him once,
I will kill...

2038
01:42:53,560 --> 01:42:54,800
Who is this mallu uncle?

2039
01:42:54,920 --> 01:42:56,240
Aren't you Gandhi?

2040
01:42:56,440 --> 01:42:57,120
Yes, sir

2041
01:42:58,040 --> 01:42:59,240
Aren't you searching
for Dilli babu?

2042
01:42:59,320 --> 01:43:00,520
- Yes, sir
- I thought so

2043
01:43:00,680 --> 01:43:01,520
Do you know me?

2044
01:43:02,840 --> 01:43:03,800
Das

2045
01:43:04,080 --> 01:43:05,040
Sakkara Das

2046
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:06,680
Forget it

2047
01:43:06,760 --> 01:43:08,520
I wanted to ask you something

2048
01:43:08,640 --> 01:43:10,720
How did you manage to
laugh at Dilli babu?

2049
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:12,840
I was waiting to properly
thank you since then

2050
01:43:12,920 --> 01:43:14,560
- I need to gift you something
- No thank you, sir

2051
01:43:14,680 --> 01:43:15,720
Wait there

2052
01:43:15,920 --> 01:43:17,680
Drink up this juice first, we
will take care of the rest then

2053
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:18,800
Sir... sir...

2054
01:43:19,200 --> 01:43:20,360
There is no sugar in it

2055
01:43:20,480 --> 01:43:22,640
- I have diabetes
- A lizard fell in it

2056
01:43:22,720 --> 01:43:23,720
You know this is wasted

2057
01:43:23,800 --> 01:43:24,800
Why the hell do you
serve this then?

2058
01:43:25,080 --> 01:43:26,080
Thank you, sir

2059
01:43:26,280 --> 01:43:27,240
Thank you so much

2060
01:43:27,520 --> 01:43:29,320
Why does he laugh after
somebody hit him?

2061
01:43:29,840 --> 01:43:30,800
Nervous laughter...

2062
01:43:31,040 --> 01:43:32,200
May be he is like me...

2063
01:43:32,920 --> 01:43:34,080
- Brother!
- Mr.Sweet smile

2064
01:43:34,560 --> 01:43:35,360
Now what you got to do is...

2065
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:37,800
Keep up your spirit and walk ahead...

2066
01:43:38,240 --> 01:43:39,160
pull out your knife...

2067
01:43:39,240 --> 01:43:40,240
and point it at Dilli babu...

2068
01:43:44,560 --> 01:43:48,200
I know this knife is nothing
before your smile...

2069
01:43:48,400 --> 01:43:50,000
Your smile is
equivalent of 10 knives

2070
01:43:50,360 --> 01:43:53,680
We are going to make this the
last night of Dilli babu

2071
01:43:53,880 --> 01:43:55,520
What a perverted being?

2072
01:43:56,200 --> 01:43:58,760
Why should we meet up
at his wedding night?

2073
01:43:59,120 --> 01:44:02,480
Babu, how am I going to
find you with these idiots?

2074
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:04,640
That's the smile... that's the spirit

2075
01:44:05,760 --> 01:44:08,840
Keep up the smile. Dilli babu,
you are done with today

2076
01:44:08,920 --> 01:44:12,480
Why am I surrounded by idiots?

2077
01:44:12,840 --> 01:44:16,080
- Why do you worry? Let me take care of the
phone - It's alright sister, thank you

2078
01:44:16,520 --> 01:44:19,480
You look really busy,
hand me the phone

2079
01:44:19,560 --> 01:44:20,840
No, I am waiting for
an important call

2080
01:44:20,920 --> 01:44:22,680
- I will take care of this. Thank you
- Ok

2081
01:44:39,640 --> 01:44:41,280
Isolate that laughing mongrel first

2082
01:44:43,320 --> 01:44:45,480
Serving juice in a feast seems
to be brilliant idea now

2083
01:44:45,720 --> 01:44:47,640
Bro, hand me the juice

2084
01:44:47,720 --> 01:44:48,360
This is not for you

2085
01:44:54,400 --> 01:44:56,080
Wasn't it right here?
Where has it gone now?

2086
01:44:56,160 --> 01:44:56,880
Boss!

2087
01:44:57,600 --> 01:44:58,560
Drink this up

2088
01:44:58,840 --> 01:44:59,640
You look tired

2089
01:45:00,600 --> 01:45:01,720
- Drink up
- We couldn't find it

2090
01:45:01,800 --> 01:45:02,720
I will find it out for you

2091
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:03,760
Where will I search now?

2092
01:45:21,720 --> 01:45:24,040
Dilli babu, Ulundurpettai is going
to be your final resting place

2093
01:45:24,200 --> 01:45:25,400
Dear, what is this?

2094
01:45:25,480 --> 01:45:26,520
Who are they?

2095
01:45:26,600 --> 01:45:27,560
They are my friends

2096
01:45:27,640 --> 01:45:29,320
- Friends?
- Yes

2097
01:45:29,400 --> 01:45:31,000
- Don't you have any girl friends?
- No

2098
01:45:31,720 --> 01:45:33,000
Careful guys

2099
01:45:33,240 --> 01:45:36,080
Sister, could you hold this for a second?

2100
01:45:36,160 --> 01:45:37,000
See how big the gift is?

2101
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:39,240
- Let's take a selfie bro
- Hey, keep your hands off her

2102
01:45:39,360 --> 01:45:41,440
Sister! Sister, my phone!

2103
01:45:47,240 --> 01:45:48,440
Sister, give my phone back

2104
01:45:48,600 --> 01:45:49,600
It's Ok. I will take care

2105
01:45:50,360 --> 01:45:51,640
Hey, show me your face

2106
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:56,880
Pose for the photo

2107
01:45:58,800 --> 01:46:01,920
In 18 seconds, his pulse will plummet

2108
01:46:06,680 --> 01:46:07,880
Look, there he is

2109
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:08,680
Did you see Dillibabu?

2110
01:46:09,680 --> 01:46:11,520
Dillibabu peed... on whom?

2111
01:46:11,600 --> 01:46:12,080
Come here

2112
01:46:12,200 --> 01:46:12,800
Gandhi!

2113
01:46:14,840 --> 01:46:15,440
It's Dillibabu

2114
01:46:15,840 --> 01:46:18,840
Hey, this is your end my son

2115
01:46:21,080 --> 01:46:21,920
Laugh now

2116
01:46:22,880 --> 01:46:23,480
He is laughing!

2117
01:46:23,560 --> 01:46:26,280
His senses will shut down
and he will freeze over

2118
01:47:03,760 --> 01:47:06,160
When you couldn't taste the
ice cream that is nearby

2119
01:47:06,240 --> 01:47:08,480
I couldn't kill even
with him by my side

2120
01:47:08,560 --> 01:47:11,000
What has happened to my body? Move

2121
01:47:25,360 --> 01:47:26,440
Gandhi... Run

2122
01:47:26,520 --> 01:47:28,040
Hey! What is happening?

2123
01:47:31,080 --> 01:47:32,600
Sir, look at that

2124
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:33,600
Oh my God

2125
01:47:33,920 --> 01:47:35,680
Where are you off to? Sit down, sir

2126
01:47:35,760 --> 01:47:37,440
It is too violent outside.
It is safe to stay here

2127
01:47:37,520 --> 01:47:38,520
Hey! I own this place

2128
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:45,040
My bladder is full, I
couldn't leak one drop

2129
01:47:45,160 --> 01:47:46,680
What is this new form of disease?

2130
01:47:46,760 --> 01:47:48,280
Where is he off to?

2131
01:47:48,640 --> 01:47:49,800
Nelson

2132
01:47:50,360 --> 01:47:52,200
He poses like a model in a beach

2133
01:47:52,720 --> 01:47:56,760
Bro, even in death you got a smile. The
wedding has now turned into a funeral now

2134
01:47:58,280 --> 01:47:59,240
- He has got pulse
- Pulse?

2135
01:47:59,520 --> 01:48:00,560
Lift him up!

2136
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:01,880
Lift him. Lift him

2137
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:02,800
Snatch that 5 million

2138
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,200
Make him frown. Kill the smile

2139
01:48:06,280 --> 01:48:08,600
My smile kills too, you idiots

2140
01:48:08,680 --> 01:48:09,760
Let's go now

2141
01:48:11,640 --> 01:48:13,600
He escapes somehow!

2142
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:19,800
So it's a one on one then

2143
01:48:19,920 --> 01:48:21,160
I can't even finish one buddy

2144
01:48:21,240 --> 01:48:23,400
Here I come for you buddy

2145
01:48:24,880 --> 01:48:26,880
Won't you ever learn your lesson?

2146
01:48:29,880 --> 01:48:31,360
Enter the dragon

2147
01:48:36,080 --> 01:48:37,800
It looks like a train journey

2148
01:48:38,040 --> 01:48:40,200
- It was you who started it all
- I started it?

2149
01:48:40,280 --> 01:48:42,840
- Yes - Why did you cheat
Dillibabu in the name of love?

2150
01:48:43,280 --> 01:48:45,040
- Dillibabu?
- Don't you know?

2151
01:48:45,520 --> 01:48:46,600
He is not my lover

2152
01:48:47,160 --> 01:48:48,280
He is my boy bestie

2153
01:48:48,360 --> 01:48:49,880
Who are these boy besties?

2154
01:48:50,840 --> 01:48:52,600
Dillibabu has posted a Tik
Tok video in the group

2155
01:48:52,680 --> 01:48:53,560
Who is that bugger?

2156
01:48:53,640 --> 01:48:54,520
Hello buddies!

2157
01:48:55,400 --> 01:48:56,360
Hello from the marriage hall!

2158
01:48:56,680 --> 01:48:57,680
Rohith...

2159
01:48:57,920 --> 01:48:58,880
I am Dillibabu

2160
01:48:59,800 --> 01:49:01,000
How long have you known her?

2161
01:49:01,360 --> 01:49:02,320
6 months?

2162
01:49:02,880 --> 01:49:04,120
I have known her for years

2163
01:49:04,520 --> 01:49:08,240
- To hell with this marriage - Trust
me I have changed. You are my last...

2164
01:49:09,560 --> 01:49:10,840
You could marry her now

2165
01:49:11,120 --> 01:49:12,880
But she will elope with me someday

2166
01:49:13,280 --> 01:49:15,400
Because the love
that we had is ...

2167
01:49:16,120 --> 01:49:17,080
TRUE

2168
01:49:17,280 --> 01:49:19,000
True... Funny face

2169
01:49:20,040 --> 01:49:22,320
Pig faced boy bestie...

2170
01:49:22,480 --> 01:49:25,320
I am going to tear you apart

2171
01:49:27,480 --> 01:49:28,440
Give me that

2172
01:49:28,520 --> 01:49:30,240
We got 2 million now, it's alright

2173
01:49:30,360 --> 01:49:31,800
We will divide the share
once we are outside

2174
01:49:32,240 --> 01:49:33,760
- What happened?
- Stay quiet

2175
01:49:34,240 --> 01:49:35,000
Oh my!

2176
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:36,920
No power in my phone

2177
01:49:37,120 --> 01:49:38,200
Use this to charge your phone

2178
01:49:39,280 --> 01:49:40,240
Plug it in

2179
01:49:40,720 --> 01:49:41,880
What is this?

2180
01:49:42,200 --> 01:49:42,880
Power bank

2181
01:49:43,200 --> 01:49:44,160
This is the hard disk

2182
01:49:44,280 --> 01:49:45,920
Everyone are searching this, you idiot

2183
01:49:46,480 --> 01:49:47,840
How can a power bank
be used as hard disk?

2184
01:51:09,320 --> 01:51:10,240
Dillibabu!

2185
01:51:10,880 --> 01:51:12,000
Dillibabu!

2186
01:51:12,360 --> 01:51:14,760
Open the door! It's me Gandhi!

2187
01:51:18,760 --> 01:51:19,680
Dillibabu!

2188
01:51:24,640 --> 01:51:25,840
Dillibabu!

2189
01:51:27,680 --> 01:51:28,680
What happened?

2190
01:51:30,520 --> 01:51:32,520
Let me tell you why
I'll only tell you this

2191
01:51:32,680 --> 01:51:34,480
Because every time I tell
my sorrows to others...

2192
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:35,520
they laugh

2193
01:51:36,360 --> 01:51:37,360
But if I tell you...

2194
01:51:37,800 --> 01:51:40,000
you consider it as your own
sorrow and feel bad about it

2195
01:51:43,640 --> 01:51:45,160
It's been an hour since I died

2196
01:51:46,480 --> 01:51:48,040
He's dead?

2197
01:51:49,480 --> 01:51:50,400
Fool!

2198
01:51:50,560 --> 01:51:51,600
Watch your step!

2199
01:51:52,480 --> 01:51:53,440
I'm talking to him

2200
01:51:53,840 --> 01:51:56,560
The moment she didn't pick my calls,
even after calling her 47 times...

2201
01:51:57,240 --> 01:51:58,360
is the moment I died, buddy

2202
01:52:01,120 --> 01:52:02,280
What is it?

2203
01:52:03,240 --> 01:52:04,720
Well buddy, you're right

2204
01:52:05,200 --> 01:52:07,120
But she didn't bother to pick your call

2205
01:52:07,680 --> 01:52:09,080
She has moved on

2206
01:52:09,720 --> 01:52:11,000
Then why are you calling her?

2207
01:52:11,120 --> 01:52:12,120
Don't call her

2208
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:14,160
Just 3 more miss calls

2209
01:52:15,400 --> 01:52:16,800
Shall I round it off to 50 calls?

2210
01:52:20,880 --> 01:52:21,840
Buddy...

2211
01:52:22,160 --> 01:52:24,200
This love has only
given you troubles

2212
01:52:24,520 --> 01:52:25,440
Forget it

2213
01:52:25,520 --> 01:52:26,880
Just forget it right here, right now

2214
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:28,320
Well, nothing wrong in telling you

2215
01:52:29,160 --> 01:52:30,240
When you guys called me

2216
01:52:30,680 --> 01:52:31,720
I put your calls on wait...

2217
01:52:32,080 --> 01:52:33,440
because I'd be talking to her

2218
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:35,240
But now when I call her...

2219
01:52:37,040 --> 01:52:39,480
her phone is always engaged

2220
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:42,760
Buddy!

2221
01:52:45,600 --> 01:52:48,000
She moved on easily and is
all set for another future

2222
01:52:48,080 --> 01:52:50,160
Right here, downstairs her
reception is happening

2223
01:52:50,280 --> 01:52:52,800
If she can move on then
can't you move on too?

2224
01:52:53,560 --> 01:52:54,520
People change

2225
01:52:54,800 --> 01:52:55,760
What was that?

2226
01:52:57,600 --> 01:52:58,600
People change

2227
01:52:59,160 --> 01:53:00,120
Memories don't

2228
01:53:00,720 --> 01:53:01,840
Google!

2229
01:53:05,600 --> 01:53:07,240
What makes me realize that I'm alive is...

2230
01:53:07,360 --> 01:53:09,400
is the pain that I am going through

2231
01:53:13,640 --> 01:53:14,600
He's laughing!

2232
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:16,200
Told you, didn't I?

2233
01:53:16,280 --> 01:53:19,160
I'm crying! I swear, I'm crying!

2234
01:53:24,080 --> 01:53:25,560
Come on, guys!

2235
01:53:27,840 --> 01:53:29,560
Why are you picking your nose?

2236
01:53:30,840 --> 01:53:32,520
I thought I shouldn't tell you this

2237
01:53:32,600 --> 01:53:35,200
Do you know what she told her friend
at the shop she used to work?

2238
01:53:35,360 --> 01:53:35,880
What?

2239
01:53:36,560 --> 01:53:38,920
You aren't earning as much
as she expected you to earn

2240
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
And it seems you aren't worth
her or her expectations

2241
01:53:41,800 --> 01:53:43,440
Which is why she agreed to this marriage

2242
01:53:43,520 --> 01:53:46,720
Go inquire around and you'll
find out about her games!

2243
01:53:48,200 --> 01:53:49,160
Beyond all this...

2244
01:53:49,760 --> 01:53:55,080
I feel so bad to see you
feel so bad for losing her

2245
01:53:56,560 --> 01:53:58,480
You guys have a wrong notion about her

2246
01:53:59,360 --> 01:54:01,360
If she is talking about my earnings then...

2247
01:54:01,520 --> 01:54:04,000
it is her concern for me, so
that I'll be driven to earn more

2248
01:54:04,560 --> 01:54:06,040
As far as this groom is concerned...

2249
01:54:06,320 --> 01:54:08,000
she's just a girl working
in the gift shop

2250
01:54:08,640 --> 01:54:09,880
But as far as I'm concerned...

2251
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:12,280
she is herself a gift!

2252
01:54:13,360 --> 01:54:15,760
How can you all judge her?

2253
01:54:27,600 --> 01:54:28,760
You tell me buddy...

2254
01:54:29,920 --> 01:54:31,920
does she looks like someone
who is behind money?

2255
01:54:33,080 --> 01:54:34,080
Tell me

2256
01:54:34,440 --> 01:54:35,400
Tell me, buddy!

2257
01:54:35,520 --> 01:54:36,480
Uh-oh!

2258
01:54:37,480 --> 01:54:38,520
What?

2259
01:54:39,360 --> 01:54:40,320
I said, tell me

2260
01:54:40,400 --> 01:54:42,680
I cannot control it anymore!

2261
01:54:47,720 --> 01:54:49,000
Why are you laughing?

2262
01:54:49,120 --> 01:54:50,560
No, I am crying!

2263
01:54:50,760 --> 01:54:53,160
Does my love life appear to you as a joke?

2264
01:54:53,280 --> 01:54:55,160
Buddy!

2265
01:54:56,680 --> 01:54:59,480
Shall we prove it by living a
successful life for you all to see?

2266
01:54:59,560 --> 01:55:02,240
Wanna bet? Shall me
and my girl prove it?

2267
01:55:03,480 --> 01:55:05,360
Are you laughing and
trying to provoke me?

2268
01:55:05,760 --> 01:55:07,040
I'll slit my wrist!

2269
01:55:09,080 --> 01:55:11,800
Now, do you believe that my
love is sincere and true!

2270
01:55:12,560 --> 01:55:14,520
He slit his wrist for real!

2271
01:55:15,880 --> 01:55:18,720
Hey! Dude! Buddy! He's still alive

2272
01:55:18,840 --> 01:55:20,440
Look, he's still laughing

2273
01:55:20,520 --> 01:55:22,880
- Are you crazy?
- Dude, get up!

2274
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:24,160
Why did you do this?

2275
01:55:24,320 --> 01:55:26,240
True love never fails

2276
01:55:26,320 --> 01:55:27,440
Why didn't you slit your throat instead?

2277
01:55:27,520 --> 01:55:28,800
Look, he's still laughing!

2278
01:55:28,880 --> 01:55:30,280
He slit himself and you wanna laugh?

2279
01:55:30,400 --> 01:55:31,760
Die you stonehearted idiot!

2280
01:55:31,840 --> 01:55:32,520
Kick him!

2281
01:55:34,760 --> 01:55:36,440
Why is he laughing instead of crying?

2282
01:55:37,520 --> 01:55:40,560
At least we laughed in a quiet manner! You
laugh so hard that too sitting next to him

2283
01:55:40,640 --> 01:55:42,520
I swear I am not laughing!

2284
01:55:42,720 --> 01:55:44,400
But that last thing he said...

2285
01:55:44,480 --> 01:55:46,480
asking if she is someone
behind money...

2286
01:55:47,160 --> 01:55:48,720
Ok, I'll go check on him.
You wait here

2287
01:56:09,040 --> 01:56:11,840
Did you ever meet that
gangster Dilli Babu again?

2288
01:56:13,640 --> 01:56:14,400
No. Never

2289
01:56:19,440 --> 01:56:20,480
Hi Dilli sir

2290
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,200
So you laugh when something
bad happens to you?

2291
01:56:31,520 --> 01:56:32,640
Holy guacamole!

2292
01:56:32,840 --> 01:56:34,880
Without realizing that I
was running behind you!

2293
01:56:36,760 --> 01:56:37,720
That's ok

2294
01:56:37,920 --> 01:56:41,760
We are all running without realizing
what is that we are running for

2295
01:56:51,880 --> 01:56:53,760
Don't you worry about this condition

2296
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:55,000
It's actually a good one!

2297
01:56:55,120 --> 01:56:58,920
Others cry in sorrow but you're laughing.
Be happy about it!

2298
01:57:01,880 --> 01:57:05,080
I understood one thing really
well in those 6 months

2299
01:57:05,920 --> 01:57:08,680
I am not some
supernatural person...

2300
01:57:09,120 --> 01:57:11,280
There are many out there like me

2301
01:57:11,680 --> 01:57:13,760
Hiding millions of worried inside...

2302
01:57:14,160 --> 01:57:16,360
but when someone asks them 'How are you?"

2303
01:57:16,800 --> 01:57:19,200
They'd smile and say "I am fine!"

2304
01:57:19,680 --> 01:57:20,440
They'll say so

2305
01:57:20,840 --> 01:57:24,400
Most of them whom we think
are very happy in life...

2306
01:57:24,480 --> 01:57:27,120
but they have thousands
of issues in their life

2307
01:57:27,600 --> 01:57:30,920
Like I realized this fact, if
you all could realize it...

2308
01:57:31,320 --> 01:57:34,560
then you will try your
best not to hurt anyone

2309
01:57:35,040 --> 01:57:37,000
Then you laughing habit...

2310
01:57:37,160 --> 01:57:38,120
How did it get cured?

2311
01:57:39,440 --> 01:57:41,320
I went and met my friend again

2312
01:57:42,120 --> 01:57:44,320
This without being myself...

2313
01:57:44,920 --> 01:57:46,800
I just acted as if I'm concerned

2314
01:57:47,360 --> 01:57:52,120
That's what, the fruits and energy drink
powder. Isn't that the whole world believes in?

2315
01:57:54,200 --> 01:57:57,000
I'm sure he'd have
laughed inside!

2316
01:57:57,080 --> 01:57:59,760
What we feel inside...

2317
01:58:00,320 --> 01:58:01,200
that's not important

2318
01:58:01,560 --> 01:58:04,760
The world judges us based on
how we show out our emotions

2319
01:58:05,800 --> 01:58:06,760
Well, then...

2320
01:58:07,480 --> 01:58:09,480
I started acting in front of everyone

2321
01:58:09,600 --> 01:58:10,920
Dad, let's leave

2322
01:58:11,160 --> 01:58:12,880
Just one final question

2323
01:58:13,520 --> 01:58:17,400
Can you tell us what issues
of late have made you laugh

2324
01:58:18,120 --> 01:58:21,600
When the whole nation were worried that our
satellite Chandrayan didn't land in moon...

2325
01:58:21,680 --> 01:58:23,200
Our locality boys alone...

2326
01:58:23,320 --> 01:58:24,680
Were also worried about 3rd block Chandru

2327
01:58:24,760 --> 01:58:28,640
Worried that he slipped and
fell into the drainage

2328
01:58:29,240 --> 01:58:31,000
That made me laugh!

2329
01:58:31,480 --> 01:58:33,200
When our beloved Abdul Kalam sir died...

2330
01:58:33,920 --> 01:58:37,600
half of the students who status saying
that we'll make sure his dreams come true....

2331
01:58:37,680 --> 01:58:40,200
but today those students are
fighting over their favorite stars

2332
01:58:40,280 --> 01:58:43,480
They indulge in violence and
even set each other ablaze!

2333
01:58:43,560 --> 01:58:44,880
All this makes me laugh!

2334
01:58:45,440 --> 01:58:47,880
Back then we bowed in
front of our rulers...

2335
01:58:48,280 --> 01:58:49,760
today we are doing the same at work

2336
01:58:49,840 --> 01:58:51,920
Half life is over at work place

2337
01:58:52,040 --> 01:58:54,440
The rest is over by the time we reach home

2338
01:58:54,600 --> 01:58:56,200
Think about such a life...

2339
01:58:56,800 --> 01:58:59,240
and that makes me laugh!

2340
01:59:00,840 --> 01:59:02,200
17 guys!

2341
01:59:02,280 --> 01:59:05,760
They abducted a minor, raped her
for months and finished her off!

2342
01:59:06,360 --> 01:59:07,560
We destroy the forest...

2343
01:59:07,840 --> 01:59:11,400
yet we live in a concrete
jungle like beasts

2344
01:59:11,840 --> 01:59:13,240
That makes me laugh!

2345
01:59:13,800 --> 01:59:17,640
Being a bystander and witnessing all
such issues happening right in front...

2346
01:59:17,720 --> 01:59:19,120
and by passing comments on it...

2347
01:59:19,200 --> 01:59:21,800
by having no compassion or concern...

2348
01:59:22,280 --> 01:59:27,000
and getting on with my life
because I have my own works...

2349
01:59:27,440 --> 01:59:29,840
and when I think that it just
makes me a normal human being

2350
01:59:32,840 --> 01:59:34,080
My inefficiency...

2351
01:59:34,600 --> 01:59:36,000
that makes me laugh!
