morning (Lahiruu7@gmail.com)

3
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,770
oh god... oh...

4
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,850
There is a story.

5
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:38,480
If our love is real, it breaks down here.

6
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,210
There's a lot of darkness here

7
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,020
I do not see anything.

8
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:45,280
What is this place?

9
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:47,490
I've been here for a month.

10
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:50,100
So, how are you paying a year?

11
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:51,830
The beating bell.

12
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:53,670
Oh, God... God... God...

13
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:59,070
Who?

14
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:00,530
House.

15
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:14,730
Who's there?

16
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:03,820
Who's... Who is?

17
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:27,410
Saddam came from here,

18
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:29,640
That's who, woman.

19
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,280
Gōṭi.

20
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,610
Holy shit!

21
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:23,510
This is awesome.

22
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,640
Karan.

23
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:27,290
Karan.

24
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,560
What was baby?

25
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,730
This is not fair.

26
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,320
What more are you from me
Hiding?

27
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,970
We're going to Paris.

28
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:41,480
Commemorate our second anniversary.

29
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:44,240
You hid one more thing.

30
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:45,380
What?

31
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,990
You suggest to me in Paris
There is.

32
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:51,210
Yes.

33
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,450
I do not want to go to Paris.

34
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,640
If you want to make volunteering for me.

35
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:57,970
So I need to go here.

36
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,850
What did you do there?

37
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:08,120
It's boring in an hour,
I do not care.

38
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,410
Do not try any other reasons

39
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:12,440
Paris, let's go.

40
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,330
It's okay.

41
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:17,420
Besides, we can drive there.

42
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,180
Just you and me.

43
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:20,910
It will be very romantic.

44
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:22,820
Please Ahana, I'm all set apart.

45
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:24,130
Please.

46
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:25,960
Then cancel.

47
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:29,530
If Ahah will want to see our Summer House.

48
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,850
You have to go with him over there.

49
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,140
But grandma.

50
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:36,500
She will soon be our admirer
To be part of a family.

51
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:40,660
You're my will
We need to take care of happiness.

52
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:45,060
Or the finger stretches
As far as we're looking.

53
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,580
We will not be angry.

54
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,750
Go to Sumear House.

55
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,870
You are my best grandmother.

56
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,710
Whatever it is there eight years ago.

57
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,700
No one else went there then.

58
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:03,260
You did not accept it.

59
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:05,400
A new beginning is needed.

60
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:08,670
The past is left behind
and left for the first time.

61
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,560
This is your chance.

62
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:15,070
Make a new bond with that house.

63
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:17,300
Make new memories with Ahana.

64
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,810
Wow.

65
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,140
Karan.

66
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:29,270
What happened?

67
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,040
What's wrong with that? Nothing.

68
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:35,250
Come on, let's go.

69
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:43,260
What is this red doll.

70
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,150
This is Molly.

71
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:46,390
Pooja doll.

72
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,130
This is security.

73
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,640
But who got involved here?

74
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:53,530
It's very stupid to cut it.

75
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:55,100
No, no, wait, wait.

76
00:12:57,450 --> 00:12:58,450
Gōṭi.

77
00:12:58,780 --> 00:12:59,440
Gōṭi.

78
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:00,710
Gōṭi.

79
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:02,820
Who is this guy?

80
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:05,410
He's the one to take care of himself here

81
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:07,110
I'll find him.

82
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,180
Gōṭi.

83
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,510
Gōṭi.

84
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,840
Aha!

85
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,600
Wow... instead of protecting
If a lock was made.

86
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:33,100
Maybe there was a lot of protection

87
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,060
you idiot.

88
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:50,450
Wow.

89
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,600
Gōṭi.

90
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,530
Karan.

91
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,340
Karan.

92
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:41,820
Karan.

93
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,160
Karan.

94
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,700
Look up.

95
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:55,770
Karan.

96
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:56,820
Karan.

97
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Hey.

98
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,200
Ahana.

99
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:10,400
What's in this room?

100
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,530
Why is it locked?

101
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:16,120
Is there a hidden treasure
in the family of the Umbera?

102
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:21,100
Or something big secret.

103
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:24,050
It's a big secret.

104
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:29,080
But you do not worry about madam
Deal with the Goths.

105
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:33,220
Unless he met you
The loving face is like a bad dream.

106
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,620
What happened?

107
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:40,030
Are you OK? I think it's boring.

108
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,480
Stop.

109
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,330
What is this?

110
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:51,040
Madam, I'm double.

111
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,600
Acrobats.

112
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,500
You said Butler.

113
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,920
God is so funny.

114
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:02,360
You're the Goetty,
Sergey Maharaj.

115
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:03,960
It's a name that Gotti.

116
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:06,220
Sergey Maharaj... my name.

117
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:08,590
Gorplatoonnewtextsearcher
O'Church Thimbknath Niphsi o.

118
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:09,870
What.

119
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:12,590
Give me the gifts I did
not say the full name

120
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,610
Sharma, or else I'm gutting.

121
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:17,790
Because I'm single.

122
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:20,070
Therefore, only Gothic.

123
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:22,750
You have been able to do this.

124
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:25,070
How to talk, Sergey Maharaj.

125
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:27,410
It's a big deception with me.

126
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,840
Yes,

127
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,530
When I was in the village, I got a call.

128
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:33,910
My job in London was fixed.

129
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,420
That's why I'm Hindi, it's Greek.

130
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:40,600
From Ba'd Mann, Johar
Everybody watched the movies.

131
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,620
The waiter was well in those films.

132
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:48,270
They were drawing this uniform.

133
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:49,730
Then what?

134
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,210
Do not be this to anyone,

135
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:55,460
I've looted all of my property.

136
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,770
This uniform was picked up.

137
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,470
He's dragged here.

138
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,840
But around here... All right.

139
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,120
Where were you?

140
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:04,710
You knew we were coming here.

141
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,320
Did you know, Sergei Maharaj?

142
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:09,900
But you did not know, you are this.

143
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:12,430
The guard will come in to the trunk.

144
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:16,770
You should have stayed
fixed for this security.

145
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:20,000
Well, you should have locked it.

146
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:24,340
I was locked in from behind.

147
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,350
But how is it?

148
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,140
Sergey Maharaj.

149
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,680
I got it all.

150
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:40,760
This has all been done.

151
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:42,790
Who is he ...?

152
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,120
She.

153
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,520
She's madam.

154
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:47,530
The one here.

155
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,860
Who's at home?

156
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:53,240
You know, at least a lot of this house
From here is the roof.

157
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:55,430
No Sergei Maharaj.

158
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:57,920
These people are not anywhere.

159
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,000
He's here.

160
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:02,010
The demon.

161
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,830
What demon...

162
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,670
Yes, ma'am.

163
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,080
Here.

164
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,960
There's a ghost here.

165
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:11,280
A woman ghost.

166
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,280
All night he's coming here to walk.

167
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,580
What are you talking about?

168
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:20,340
Too.

169
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:22,300
It's 3.00.

170
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:24,350
There are no demons.

171
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:29,320
You do not have the
right to make fun of them.

172
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:31,310
They,

173
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,820
If I'm angry...
Then he will beat me.

174
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,370
So, madam.

175
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,470
Come out of here
Wherever you are.

176
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:47,410
Come quickly and see me.

177
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:49,520
Scared of a scoundrel. What am I doing?

178
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:54,250
If I have the strength, my old age
Come and show me.

179
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:56,920
Come on,

180
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,010
Show me a fuss.

181
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,760
These are all bags.

182
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:10,740
Bring him upstairs.

183
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:22,470
Right?

184
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:32,350
Hello - Hey, Karen.

185
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,040
Hi Dock.

186
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:37,230
I'm sorry, my eyour listing
I forgot to cancel it.

187
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,920
You'll find the site again.

188
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,290
But I'm your way this way
Listen, call.

189
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,390
Third round.

190
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:50,340
That means you feel better, right?

191
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,210
I feel very well, Shivani.

192
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,810
Actually, I'm off of the office
He left with Ahana.

193
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:57,580
Really.

194
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:59,460
That's great.

195
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:03,560
Do you know what a doctor says to the
doctor? They're telling their patients.

196
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:05,160
You do not want to see him again.

197
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:06,830
I think so.

198
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,980
Do you have a good time?

199
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:11,380
That's where you are?

200
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:13,660
I'm Duck.

201
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:15,460
The Summer House arrived.

202
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:18,540
Stay.

203
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:20,640
Is your Summer House?

204
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,600
Karen, did you take the medicine?

205
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:26,680
Yes, Doc, he's with me.

206
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:29,360
No, you're taking medication, right?

207
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,440
It's me.

208
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:34,390
Karan.

209
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,460
Your doctor for so long.

210
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,400
When I lie, I know.

211
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:40,680
Doc have my feelings, right?

212
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:42,210
Like.

213
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,160
It's always mine
It looks like you are.

214
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:46,110
It looks like someone looks at the o.

215
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,950
Somebody's listening to me.

216
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:49,370
That feeling has disappeared.

217
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:50,660
It's gone now

218
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,100
that's fine.

219
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:55,240
But please, you are yours
Take it in medication.

220
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:56,750
Especially now.

221
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,930
You... at that house.

222
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:00,990
You can not take a chance.

223
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:02,140
You're right,

224
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,880
I'm very sorry

225
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:05,350
I'll get my medicine.

226
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,150
Well.

227
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,520
Happiness.

228
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:10,430
Then ask something right
If you have a problem, at any time.

229
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:11,770
Call me.

230
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:12,910
All right, Doc.

231
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,960
Be careful - Bye.

232
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:15,070
Bye.

233
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,330
Oh, my God..

234
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:34,370
They would not have to break this guard.

235
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:37,230
It was a bad sign.

236
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:40,130
I feel.

237
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,610
It's going to be a big big deal.

238
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:44,350
Please.

239
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,780
We'll protect you all.

240
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,530
Strange.

241
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:13,230
Gōṭi.

242
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:15,930
Gōṭi.

243
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,230
Sergey Maharaj.

244
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:21,310
What's for breakfast?

245
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,500
Eggs Bujju, Panier Bujji, Pasta Parata,
Paneer paratay, Mai Parata.

246
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:27,610
Goli Opa, Itali, Wade Sambaru,
Miracle Samurai, Saddle Samurai.

247
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,420
Saeedwan Dosa, Kitty Potato Potatoes.

248
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,620
Karm seeds.

249
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:35,160
These are nothing.

250
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,700
But sir, if you tell me what you eat

251
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:40,180
I'll bring you to the shop.

252
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,280
How long will it take?

253
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:42,720
It's mine.

254
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:44,970
What?

255
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,220
What do you mean...

256
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:49,960
The tea is hot tonight.

257
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,490
I went and this came
After three or four hours.

258
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,600
Right.

259
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,550
Just wait, I'll come with you too.

260
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:00,790
Great Goodbye.

261
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:04,300
Looks like Chathurycs in a car
Like sitting in time.

262
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,500
We have not seen such
a mystery here before.

263
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,220
Open your mouths and tell.

264
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,370
I said.

265
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:41,550
When this fog comes out of here
No, sir. Maharaj.

266
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:45,890
He's our grandmother every day
This is what I said.

267
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,950
The dark shadows will stop the light.

268
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:51,340
To stop the car? From here.

269
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:53,300
What do you mean?
Keep your mouth shut.

270
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:54,520
Close your mouth.

271
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,820
But you do not mind if your
teeth are out of the way.

272
00:28:58,370 --> 00:28:59,610
Oh, shit.

273
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,340
What happened, Sergei Maharaj.

274
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,510
Where is he, Sergei? Maharaj.

275
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:16,810
There was somebody there

276
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,300
where is?

277
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:21,040
You do not have any eyes anymore.

278
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,590
This is definitely the women
Do the demon.

279
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,700
Go and see.

280
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:28,780
Go.

281
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:35,460
Going

282
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,340
Sergei Maharaj, there's no one here.

283
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,590
Nothing.

284
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,690
How is it?

285
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:22,880
I looked right For God's sake.

286
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:27,310
Get out of here.
Where are you going?

287
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:11,900
Ma'am.

288
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:17,270
Sergey Maharaj.

289
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,470
Mmm... this is very tasty.

290
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:22,870
What's this?

291
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,940
Ma'am, this is this.

292
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,110
What?

293
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:33,620
Sergey Maharaj is a
type of specialty noodle.

294
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:38,420
Actually, my mom made me
Sergey Maharaj taught.

295
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,550
Whatever's better.

296
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:41,850
You like that.

297
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:45,850
Actually, my grandma very much likes this.

298
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:50,550
And in the grandmother's tale we
are in the village It's all made.

299
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:53,060
Grandma's threeteen.

300
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:54,820
On the day she lost her.

301
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,780
A story tells us that a man died.

302
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:02,200
They have their spirits
It's been for 7 days

303
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,400
around the orbit around the spinning...
Gothy.

304
00:32:06,810 --> 00:32:08,170
You have to bring the wine back ..

305
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:10,170
Gōṭi.

306
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,780
Leave the demons
Get used to fearing.

307
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:16,130
Bring.

308
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,890
Sergey Maharaj - Ma'am.

309
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:28,530
I hate this sound.

310
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:30,490
Stop this clock

311
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:32,250
I hate that sound.

312
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:34,420
His watch Sergey Maharaj

313
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:35,960
what?

314
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:37,940
It's its clock.

315
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:39,750
How can I stop it?

316
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:42,760
Sergey Maharaja, is I okay?

317
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:44,880
How's your name? Stop it.

318
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,300
Right.

319
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:51,600
What happened again?

320
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:53,110
Hmm...

321
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:02,950
Ahana Gotvia.

322
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,500
Ahana.

323
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:06,430
What are you doing here?

324
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:08,926
You do not know that it does
not fill the hair at night.

325
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:10,750
This is a brainstorming method.

326
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:13,350
What's wrong with you?
Are you true?

327
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:14,770
Demons.

328
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,980
When did you ever begin to accept these?

329
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:19,360
Do not comb in today.

330
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:21,950
Tomorrow I'll tell the cat to
get into the middle of the road.

331
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,250
Then I'll say Amavas is a night.

332
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:27,570
God damn it.

333
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,200
Yes, I'm sorry

334
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:32,600
you are crazy.

335
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:36,050
I do not understand you
How loving you.

336
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,830
I'm a crazy guy too.

337
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,710
All right, then, Mr. Ahmed
I need to bathe my hair.

338
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:39,080
<i>More than breathing.</i>

339
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:44,620
<i>You need me...</i>

340
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:48,160
<i>It's been.</i>

341
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:54,600
<i>I was just incompatible.</i>

342
00:36:57,140 --> 00:37:00,650
<i>Your job was complete</i>

343
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,680
Maya.

344
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,630
Karan.

345
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:34,340
Wow... Some wording.

346
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:37,230
How to use these words...

347
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,570
Oh, God... God... God...

348
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:41,160
What was happening.

349
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:43,810
This is the woman's ghost.

350
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:46,090
I swear, my God.

351
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:48,790
Today I am never after this
Do not swear.

352
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:51,050
By God's name... no... no...

353
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:53,600
What are they saying to the market?
Got to go.

354
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,420
Oh god... oh...

355
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:06,600
Is anyone scared of this, Ma'am?

356
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:10,700
Ahana - Yes.

357
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:13,600
Okay, we're going to be late.
OK, I'm coming.

358
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:16,750
We're going to the hostel
Make food.

359
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:18,380
Right.

360
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:23,340
But where to put it.

361
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:24,900
That's not so...

362
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:26,320
Madam.

363
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,430
Where is my place?

364
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:37,880
So you've been in your for 15 years
I spent all the holiday here.

365
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,320
Yes.

366
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,820
Today is the same.

367
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,460
Has not changed anything.

368
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:46,310
Come on.

369
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:48,770
We have to do
Organize all to the show.

370
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,320
Miss Smith - Sorry.

371
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:50,960
Right.

372
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:52,210
Aduragattada?

373
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:55,460
My God, Karan Admira

374
00:40:58,470 --> 00:40:59,780
how are your?

375
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,460
How long after you came.

376
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:03,660
Look at you.

377
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:06,920
You're getting grown
up like a Hanseatic boy.

378
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:10,780
I was just like I was, but you are
It's still beautiful.

379
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:14,280
This is Ahana - Hi.

380
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,310
Ahana Miss Smith.

381
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:19,570
I'm a lot of Metr from here
Have you ever heard of the blunder?

382
00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:22,320
But the chocolate even more.

383
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:27,930
Good luck to you again.

384
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,640
Happily seen.

385
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:34,630
Wait a minute.

386
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:37,120
This is just the Milk Shaikh.

387
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:39,080
Yes, that's it.

388
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:41,570
Your favorite, double chocolate.

389
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:44,040
Go to your little boy
Take Milk Shake.

390
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:46,030
We'll drink Potihon's tea.

391
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,500
I like him.

392
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:49,780
Come on.

393
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:52,740
Oh, I'm very curious.

394
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:55,290
Attention all photos Got it.

395
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:58,170
Karan with this hostel
I've been too busy.

396
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:02,020
The last thing I remember was running out.

397
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:05,120
The devil is very bad.

398
00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:08,000
Today I am very happy to see it.

399
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:10,350
Thank you, Ahana.

400
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:13,190
She's never coming alone.

401
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:16,460
No... No, Karan is coming
I was very happy.

402
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:19,310
What else did he say?

403
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:20,740
Did not she just say?

404
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:24,040
There are many photos
Let me show you.

405
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:44,950
This is very cute.

406
00:42:46,810 --> 00:42:48,260
And who is this?

407
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:51,110
These two too were together.

408
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:52,570
Bound.

409
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:54,280
Best friends.

410
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,320
Karan.

411
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,870
And this is Samir.

412
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,760
Actually, they're not two of them.

413
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,710
These are really three.

414
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:03,950
Three - Three.

415
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:06,230
He was with a girl.

416
00:43:06,310 --> 00:43:07,890
His name - Miss Smith.

417
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:10,890
Why do you remember the old stories?

418
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:13,540
Ahan's habit makes me uncomfortable
Look at appointments.

419
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:15,470
He tried to tell me something.
No no.

420
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:16,980
Please do not tell me my secrets.

421
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:17,820
Karan.

422
00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:19,010
Take this Drink Milk Shake.

423
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:20,070
No, I drank some tea.

424
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:21,320
Try it out.

425
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:27,280
Tasty... thank you.

426
00:43:31,850 --> 00:43:33,770
Does not the cher chirp in the bell sound?

427
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:36,550
Nothing has changed here.

428
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:39,110
Everything is exactly the same

429
00:43:39,310 --> 00:43:40,660
I think that's my pressure.

430
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:43,700
Ahana gets close to Karu.

431
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:44,880
Let's go. Let's go.

432
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:46,180
Definitely.

433
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:48,530
Thank you, Miss Smith.

434
00:43:48,910 --> 00:43:51,260
Nice to meet you - Me too.

435
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:55,650
For Karen secrets
I'll be back in a day.

436
00:43:55,730 --> 00:43:56,730
Definitely.

437
00:43:56,830 --> 00:43:58,590
Careful, Darling - Bye

438
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:02,120
Maya.

439
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:05,260
Is this true.

440
00:45:12,330 --> 00:45:14,310
No, you're not.

441
00:45:19,530 --> 00:45:20,530
Ahana.

442
00:45:23,330 --> 00:45:25,280
I'm sorry, Ahana
It's one weekend.

443
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:28,160
Willingly be forgiven?

444
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:55,940
Maya.

445
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:58,690
What happened?

446
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:02,630
Are you OK?

447
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:08,880
Do not be scared.

448
00:49:09,430 --> 00:49:10,730
It must have been a bad dream.

449
00:49:11,810 --> 00:49:13,770
It's okay to sleep.

450
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:26,060
Shivani looks strange dreams.

451
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:27,330
Scary.

452
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:29,330
It's like dreams.

453
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:32,750
But this road is very strange.

454
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:34,840
It's just that everything is real.

455
00:49:35,410 --> 00:49:38,700
Calm down... Calm down... they're dreaming.

456
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:42,570
Even when it feels so bad, I open my eyes
And all of it ends.

457
00:49:43,370 --> 00:49:44,840
I know it's not easy, but.

458
00:49:45,110 --> 00:49:46,750
You have to face it.

459
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:49,160
Whenever you jump from your past.

460
00:49:49,450 --> 00:49:52,240
Be the master
You need to be strong.

461
00:49:52,730 --> 00:49:54,840
- Get the medicine, right?
- Yes.

462
00:49:55,330 --> 00:49:56,880
Did not miss the same dose.

463
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:00,040
But I still think it's always
Someone's staying with me.

464
00:50:00,570 --> 00:50:02,330
Someone's watching me.

465
00:50:03,630 --> 00:50:05,230
And now these dreams.

466
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:08,380
Shivani: I'm crazy.

467
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:10,410
Whatever happens, right?

468
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:13,380
Nothing happens... do something.

469
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:16,270
At least one slice before bedtime
Drink two pills instead.

470
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:18,070
Calm down, okay?

471
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:22,050
After years of work
It took you a break.

472
00:50:22,490 --> 00:50:24,480
Renew old memories at home.

473
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:27,550
But you have to keep your mind clear.

474
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:29,580
Just remembering good things.

475
00:50:29,950 --> 00:50:32,230
And bad things Forget about it

476
00:50:32,290 --> 00:50:33,290
let go.

477
00:50:34,430 --> 00:50:35,430
Be careful.

478
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:39,150
Listen to the medicine
Or call me.

479
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:42,180
Thank you - Good.

480
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:50,060
Ahana.

481
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:51,360
What is this?

482
00:50:51,790 --> 00:50:53,380
Where are you taking me?

483
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:56,980
You know I do not like this.

484
00:50:57,340 --> 00:50:59,660
Remove the belt from your fist.
Right, baby.

485
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:00,920
All right.

486
00:51:01,180 --> 00:51:02,340
Further steps

487
00:51:02,450 --> 00:51:03,000
1

488
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:03,890
2

489
00:51:04,330 --> 00:51:05,330
3

490
00:51:24,950 --> 00:51:26,470
Ahana, you are not yourself.

491
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:31,560
All of this is what I want to do.

492
00:51:31,710 --> 00:51:33,480
From now on.

493
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:35,980
You and my own separate world.

494
00:51:36,270 --> 00:51:37,860
We need to stay in.

495
00:51:38,350 --> 00:51:39,770
Timeless

496
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:42,220
me too.

497
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:43,580
Timeless.

498
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:52,890
Champagne.

499
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:17,380
Cheers to us - Cheers to us.

500
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:32,740
To hear one thing?

501
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:35,150
Anything you want?

502
00:52:36,630 --> 00:52:37,630
Who is the Maya?

503
00:52:40,310 --> 00:52:41,560
How do you know him?

504
00:52:41,890 --> 00:52:42,890
I do not know.

505
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:44,590
That's why I want to know.

506
00:52:45,210 --> 00:52:46,620
Ex-boyfriend

507
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:49,950
Maya... Maya is a good friend.

508
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,330
Just a friend?

509
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:54,920
Then why are you dreaming about him?

510
00:52:55,590 --> 00:52:57,740
It's dreaming.

511
00:52:58,020 --> 00:53:00,430
Those in the heart, right?

512
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:04,860
No, Ahana is a pretty friend
The hostel was.

513
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:08,630
We've been all over for a long time
We passed with each other.

514
00:53:10,830 --> 00:53:12,950
I think we are hosts yesterday
Have you gone together?

515
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,380
So maybe you remember old memories.

516
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:18,760
So you must be a very good friend.

517
00:53:24,110 --> 00:53:25,110
I know.

518
00:53:25,370 --> 00:53:27,530
From time to time, I respond very well.

519
00:53:28,510 --> 00:53:30,580
But I would never like
to give you a sorrow.

520
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:33,860
I love you - I love you too.

521
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:36,510
It's not that easy.

522
00:53:40,810 --> 00:53:42,740
Where does Ahana go?
Do not go there.

523
00:53:42,830 --> 00:53:44,950
Let's go if you can stop me.

524
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:47,200
Ahana is not a joke.

525
00:53:47,410 --> 00:53:48,210
Come back.

526
00:53:48,370 --> 00:53:49,540
Not coming.

527
00:53:51,410 --> 00:53:53,210
Ahana come back.

528
00:53:54,130 --> 00:53:55,820
I'm telling you to come out

529
00:53:57,110 --> 00:53:58,300
I'll tell you.

530
00:53:58,810 --> 00:53:59,870
Come with me.

531
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:01,860
Ahana, oh well...

532
00:54:02,050 --> 00:54:02,880
Come out

533
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:04,300
I say so.

534
00:54:04,540 --> 00:54:06,360
Come with me.

535
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:09,760
Ahana is the last time.

536
00:54:10,030 --> 00:54:11,910
Or I'm going Come out.

537
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:13,100
Ahana.

538
00:54:13,850 --> 00:54:15,100
I'm going.

539
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:25,810
What happened to her?

540
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:34,880
Who's there?

541
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:54,520
Karan.

542
00:58:54,790 --> 00:58:56,010
Karan.

543
00:58:56,750 --> 00:58:58,200
Karan.

544
00:58:58,400 --> 00:58:59,890
Karan.

545
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:06,560
Ahana.

546
00:59:10,310 --> 00:59:11,390
Ahana.

547
00:59:25,990 --> 00:59:27,470
I love you Maya

548
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:49,980
Maya.

549
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:09,130
I love you Maya.

550
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:47,590
Is this the Maya?

551
01:00:50,470 --> 01:00:52,440
Only a good friend.

552
01:00:57,350 --> 01:00:59,110
This is your secret.

553
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:02,740
That's why I was unhappy with coming here.

554
01:01:05,950 --> 01:01:07,410
Now I understand.

555
01:01:07,690 --> 01:01:09,310
That call is coming from whom.

556
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:13,120
Here, I get the magic.

557
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:17,760
Answer me?

558
01:01:18,750 --> 01:01:21,090
Who is defrauding
for me? Person?

559
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:22,730
Or is it you?

560
01:01:23,350 --> 01:01:24,750
I trusted you.

561
01:01:25,150 --> 01:01:27,090
I never thought you were me

01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:31,530
Surprisingly surprising!

01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:33,050
Are you still here?

565
01:03:38,210 --> 01:03:39,680
Ahana - Do not waste your time.

01:03:40,090 --> 01:03:42,200
Go to her.

567

I can not - why?

568
01:03:46,790 --> 01:03:48,590
Did you even give in?

569
01:03:49,410 --> 01:03:52,930
Oh, there will be a good friend.

570
01:03:54,490 --> 01:03:56,090
Is that the truth?

571
01:03:58,520 --> 01:03:59,730
It's so sad.

572
01:04:00,170 --> 01:04:03,270
Lying liar... liar... enough.

573
01:04:04,870 --> 01:04:06,510
You want to hear the truth?

574
01:04:11,970 --> 01:04:13,910
The truth is for you Then listen

575
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:21,710
I'll tell you.

576
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:24,180
Maya's story.

577
01:04:52,010 --> 01:04:53,170
Come on.

578
01:04:53,860 --> 01:04:54,730
Hiyam

579
01:04:54,860 --> 01:04:55,870
Maya Maya.

580
01:04:56,300 --> 01:04:57,000
Yes.

581
01:04:57,240 --> 01:04:59,800
Current really Sameer, with Karen
Get out.

582
01:04:59,890 --> 01:05:01,200
So come to get permission.

583
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:02,440
It's okay.

584
01:05:03,590 --> 01:05:05,940
But it's like looking for you like a clone.

585
01:05:06,090 --> 01:05:09,970
No... No... Madam, what are you doing? The nightmare
is not combing the hair and the demons come.

586
01:05:10,110 --> 01:05:11,110
What,

587
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:14,050
The spirits come back alright.

588
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:17,460
Darling, is this you shower?
Captain is holding on.

589
01:05:17,940 --> 01:05:18,610
Yes, ma'am.

590
01:05:18,730 --> 01:05:23,220
It was really even in the evenings, then, at dawn
The hairpiece did not need to fill up at night.

591
01:05:23,340 --> 01:05:24,340
Look at this.

592
01:05:25,340 --> 01:05:27,590
Wow is beautiful - Thank you.

593
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:29,840
But this is all blind belief.

594
01:05:30,300 --> 01:05:31,670
You're even better.

595
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:33,780
Ma'am, this is all true.

596
01:05:34,340 --> 01:05:37,760
Now if you go to the partying, or else
Standing with me?

597
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:40,670
Ma'am, do not do it - Go now

598
01:05:52,910 --> 01:05:53,910
Samir.

599
01:05:56,270 --> 01:05:58,360
Karan you too.

600
01:05:59,170 --> 01:06:02,180
Now your hair is thinner
And you do not comb in the night.

601
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:04,030
What to do now? You're the same.

602
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:06,390
This is why Maiten was funny about my hair.

603
01:06:06,410 --> 01:06:07,410
Now you are

604
01:06:07,450 --> 01:06:09,970
I've been making fun of you,
Leave them off

605
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:12,980
I look like a fool now
You can not go with anywhere.

606
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:14,670
Excuse me... I'll kiss you.

607
01:06:14,910 --> 01:06:16,050
Do not do it at all.

608
01:06:16,290 --> 01:06:18,110
You also laughed at me beat it.

609
01:06:18,230 --> 01:06:19,510
Now I do not need to go anywhere

610
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:20,840
Maya Maya - Maya.

611
01:06:20,950 --> 01:06:22,090
Oh, it's just a joke.

612
01:06:22,730 --> 01:06:24,160
Do not scream so much now

613
01:06:24,590 --> 01:06:25,590
beat it.

614
01:06:25,610 --> 01:06:26,610
Okay, so stay.

615
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:28,700
Watch this I'm with you two...

616
01:06:39,530 --> 01:06:41,920
You two are really crazy.

617
01:06:59,270 --> 01:07:00,680
Who is there?

618
01:07:20,410 --> 01:07:21,410
Who's there?

619
01:09:11,180 --> 01:09:12,180
Miss Smith.

620
01:09:37,570 --> 01:09:39,400
How scary?

621
01:09:39,450 --> 01:09:42,190
And your last one
The last one is great.

622
01:09:42,210 --> 01:09:44,360
You wear masks and wear it
You lose weight.

623
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:45,440
It's fun.

624
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:48,360
Now let's face it
Are you going to scare us?

625
01:09:52,990 --> 01:09:55,050
Are you really crazy?

626
01:09:55,250 --> 01:09:58,500
Once you're dead,
you will also be ditched us If so,

627
01:09:59,090 --> 01:10:00,560
I can not do anything for anyone.

628
01:10:00,620 --> 01:10:03,710
You do not have to be more a hero
You should stay in the hostel.

629
01:10:04,230 --> 01:10:05,710
Just for one more day.

630
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,350
One more day... Why?

631
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:15,260
Ladies and Gentlemen this is a great worry
Letter to Germany for my internship training

632
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:17,020
I leave Germany.

633
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:18,380
Wow.

634
01:10:18,830 --> 01:10:20,420
Are you leaving us?

635
01:10:20,630 --> 01:10:22,300
Now do not feel emotional.

636
01:10:22,550 --> 01:10:24,010
This is awesome.

637
01:10:24,860 --> 01:10:28,910
So why are we waiting?
Let's go and celebrate a party.

638
01:10:29,630 --> 01:10:32,890
Anything you like
The next 24 hours, you boss.

639
01:10:32,940 --> 01:10:34,490
We are saying that we are doing.

640
01:10:34,590 --> 01:10:36,890
- Really?
- Of course.

641
01:10:39,470 --> 01:10:40,470
Then.

642
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:42,760
The next 24 hours.

643
01:10:43,860 --> 01:10:45,150
I am Karan Ahmedera.

644
01:10:46,780 --> 01:10:47,780
That means...

645
01:10:48,180 --> 01:10:50,310
Karan is all about Aladdin.

646
01:10:50,830 --> 01:10:52,910
It's all mine.

647
01:10:53,550 --> 01:10:54,550
Right.

648
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:58,800
For the next 24 hours,
we're your employees.

649
01:11:01,740 --> 01:11:03,350
Your order is my Majesty.

650
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:04,690
That's the perfect story.

651
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:06,590
We go and party.

652
01:14:07,110 --> 01:14:08,160
The beer is over.

653
01:14:08,620 --> 01:14:09,890
Get some more.

654
01:14:10,390 --> 01:14:11,520
Excuse me.

655
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:12,920
Get it now.

656
01:14:13,740 --> 01:14:16,320
That's the story... That's my best friend
Ladies and gentlemen.

657
01:14:18,830 --> 01:14:21,180
And Darling, you're for me
What are you doing?

658
01:14:21,260 --> 01:14:22,390
Tell me what to do.

659
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:23,880
Kiss me, baby

660
01:14:27,390 --> 01:14:28,390
Sam.

661
01:14:28,930 --> 01:14:29,930
Leave.

662
01:14:30,710 --> 01:14:32,750
Where are you going... before coming to me?
Leave.

663
01:14:32,820 --> 01:14:34,250
What are you doing, Sam?

664
01:14:34,350 --> 01:14:36,360
I like it - Leave me.

665
01:14:37,450 --> 01:14:40,540
You're crazy, Samir
We've been friends since age 10.

666
01:14:43,030 --> 01:14:44,320
That's right, right.

667
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:46,050
What's the problem?

668
01:14:46,300 --> 01:14:47,600
For one night only.

669
01:14:48,190 --> 01:14:49,510
Forget everything in the morning.

670
01:14:50,150 --> 01:14:52,850
And you said that
I want something.

671
01:14:53,110 --> 01:14:54,440
Everything you give me.

672
01:14:54,830 --> 01:14:56,940
Leave Samer, Sameer.

673
01:14:58,610 --> 01:15:00,820
- Karan Karan...
- Sameer.

674
01:15:01,820 --> 01:15:03,370
What are you doing? Crazy

675
01:15:04,350 --> 01:15:05,350
are you OK?

676
01:15:06,180 --> 01:15:08,930
The Awamble said the next 24 hours.

677
01:15:09,140 --> 01:15:11,120
All of your things are mine.

678
01:15:12,500 --> 01:15:14,180
Put your hand on it.

679
01:15:14,450 --> 01:15:15,930
The problem with me.

680
01:15:16,040 --> 01:15:16,750
Send in here.

681
01:15:16,820 --> 01:15:19,460
Sameer is very drunk.
You're out of here

682
01:15:22,390 --> 01:15:23,950
Karen... Karen... Karen... my friend.

683
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:25,900
You do one thing.

684
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:27,570
You get out of here

685
01:15:28,090 --> 01:15:29,170
I'll handle her.

686
01:15:29,830 --> 01:15:31,320
Maya's here - Sameer.

687
01:15:34,180 --> 01:15:36,620
Try to touch him once more.

688
01:15:36,850 --> 01:15:37,850
Take care.

689
01:15:39,180 --> 01:15:41,910
My friend thought that it was not a brother
I am your brother.

690
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:44,800
Since when did this happen to Sameer?

691
01:15:45,080 --> 01:15:47,500
With this mage? Shame on you.

692
01:15:48,150 --> 01:15:50,110
We're with a dumpy guy like you.

693
01:15:50,740 --> 01:15:52,180
Sameer's out.

694
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:53,900
You get out of here.

695
01:15:54,490 --> 01:15:56,530
Do not show your brain after today.

696
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:18,950
After that day.

697
01:16:20,020 --> 01:16:21,600
I never saw Saamir again.

698
01:16:22,140 --> 01:16:25,460
So when he left, you and I are
Only remains.

699
01:16:26,130 --> 01:16:27,130
After...

700
01:16:27,420 --> 01:16:29,230
What happened next?

701
01:16:30,740 --> 01:16:32,670
After Sameer was gone.

702
01:16:33,210 --> 01:16:36,210
We are with each other at the moment
Practice yourself.

703
01:16:37,740 --> 01:16:39,700
We were very close.

704
01:16:41,260 --> 01:16:42,990
That's when we felt.

705
01:16:43,460 --> 01:16:44,830
We're in love.

706
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:46,120
What?

707
01:16:46,490 --> 01:16:48,320
What do you mean? Where are you?

708
01:16:48,370 --> 01:16:50,690
Office roof, three hours drive.

709
01:16:50,790 --> 01:16:53,320
Your birthday was celebrating with you.

710
01:16:53,640 --> 01:16:54,640
And nobody's home

711
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:56,120
come soon

712
01:16:56,150 --> 01:16:58,050
Karen has prepared a dine at home.

713
01:16:58,130 --> 01:17:00,620
All family is here
I was told before.

714
01:17:00,980 --> 01:17:03,110
I do not have to come.

715
01:17:03,390 --> 01:17:05,790
You're definitely coming
I'm waiting for you.

716
01:17:06,460 --> 01:17:07,460
And.

717
01:17:07,730 --> 01:17:09,880
Listen, you also have a spree.

718
01:17:11,930 --> 01:17:12,930
Karan.

719
01:18:14,510 --> 01:18:15,950
I love you Maya

720
01:19:23,380 --> 01:19:24,380
Maya

721
01:19:30,610 --> 01:19:33,680
Karen, you have so much... these.

722
01:19:34,290 --> 01:19:35,510
For me.

723
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:40,820
From today... from now.

724
01:19:41,380 --> 01:19:44,200
My entire life is with you
I would like to pay.

725
01:19:45,430 --> 01:19:46,430
I am my pleasure.

726
01:19:46,660 --> 01:19:48,160
And your grief

727
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:50,000
I like being myself.

728
01:19:51,290 --> 01:19:53,100
You are my present Future.

729
01:19:53,330 --> 01:19:54,590
To join?

730
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:02,090
Will you marry me?

731
01:20:45,780 --> 01:20:51,030
<i>More than breathing.</i>

732
01:20:52,040 --> 01:20:55,060
<i>More than breathing.</i>

733
01:20:55,380 --> 01:20:58,250
<i>You need</i>

734
01:20:58,540 --> 01:21:01,820
<i>I was just incompatible.</i>

735
01:21:01,880 --> 01:21:04,730
<i>You perfected it.</i>

736
01:21:04,820 --> 01:21:07,930
<i>More than breathing.</i>

737
01:21:08,210 --> 01:21:11,170
<i>You wanted</i>

738
01:21:11,300 --> 01:21:14,510
<i>I was just incompatible.</i>

739
01:21:14,590 --> 01:21:17,940
<i>You perfected it.</i>

740
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:21,350
<i>My mind...</i>

741
01:21:21,540 --> 01:21:24,280
<i>Your Pneumatics...</i>

742
01:21:24,710 --> 01:21:30,670
<i>Inside, the only one in their own heart.</i>

743
01:21:31,090 --> 01:21:34,340
<i>My mind...</i>

744
01:21:34,350 --> 01:21:37,160
<i>Your Pneumatics...</i>

745
01:21:37,460 --> 01:21:43,120
<i>Inside, the only one in their own heart.</i>

746
01:21:43,220 --> 01:21:46,430
<i>More than breathing.</i>

747
01:21:46,570 --> 01:21:49,180
<i>You wanted</i>

748
01:21:49,540 --> 01:21:52,930
<i>I was just incompatible.</i>

749
01:21:53,070 --> 01:21:55,950
<i>You've completed it.</i>

750
01:21:56,590 --> 01:21:59,850
<i>My mind...</i>

751
01:21:59,960 --> 01:22:02,670
<i>Your Puma...</i>

752
01:22:03,030 --> 01:22:08,880
<i>In one's own bedroom.</i>

753
01:22:09,420 --> 01:22:12,660
<i>My mind...</i>

754
01:22:12,750 --> 01:22:15,280
<i>Your Puma...</i>

755
01:22:15,780 --> 01:22:21,640
<i>Inside, the only one in their own heart.</i>

756
01:22:35,710 --> 01:22:38,700
<i>My eyes...</i>

757
01:22:38,870 --> 01:22:41,570
<i>Tell me...</i>

758
01:22:41,990 --> 01:22:45,020
<i>Your heartbeat...</i>

759
01:22:45,240 --> 01:22:47,870
<i>It belongs to me...</i>

760
01:22:48,360 --> 01:22:50,900
<i>My eyes...</i>

761
01:22:51,530 --> 01:22:54,250
<i>Tell me...</i>

762
01:22:54,670 --> 01:22:57,690
<i>Your heartbeat...</i>

763
01:22:57,800 --> 01:22:59,990
<i>It belongs to me...</i>

764
01:23:00,290 --> 01:23:03,330
<i>In the life of the questions.</i>

765
01:23:03,450 --> 01:23:06,660
<i>You want to fill in the color.</i>

766
01:23:06,730 --> 01:23:09,690
<i>Do not do anything with your lips.</i>

767
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:12,910
<i>Forget questions.</i>

768
01:23:13,030 --> 01:23:16,020
<i>In the life of the questions.</i>

769
01:23:16,250 --> 01:23:19,620
<i>You want to fill in the color.</i>

770
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:22,450
<i>No leverage through your lips.</i>

771
01:23:22,630 --> 01:23:25,020
<i>Forget questions.</i>

772
01:23:26,130 --> 01:23:28,950
<i>My mind...</i>

773
01:23:29,570 --> 01:23:32,430
<i>Your heartbeat...</i>

774
01:23:32,620 --> 01:23:37,960
<i>Inside, the only one in their own heart.</i>

775
01:23:38,940 --> 01:23:41,750
<i>My mind...</i>

776
01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:44,460
<i>Your heartbeat...</i>

777
01:23:45,270 --> 01:23:50,870
<i>There's only one snooker in my heart.</i>

778
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:11,110
Would you suggest him marry?

779
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:14,790
Then why the hell are you with me?
Why are not you with him?

780
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:19,430
Because he left me

781
01:24:20,270 --> 01:24:21,270
why?

782
01:24:22,020 --> 01:24:23,020
He said no?

783
01:24:23,310 --> 01:24:24,510
Or did you stop dating?

784
01:24:28,530 --> 01:24:29,770
Before taking hold of the hand.

785
01:24:30,410 --> 01:24:32,900
Destiny we separated.

786
01:24:34,340 --> 01:24:35,340
Magic

787
01:24:36,210 --> 01:24:38,200
I've snatched them from me forever.

788
01:24:40,460 --> 01:24:41,460
That night.

789
01:24:42,020 --> 01:24:43,280
This house.

790
01:24:43,990 --> 01:24:44,990
Out.

791
01:24:46,100 --> 01:24:47,910
He fell off the balcony.

792
01:24:49,140 --> 01:24:50,570
He was on this.

793
01:24:51,270 --> 01:24:52,780
I did not have bedding with me.

794
01:24:54,490 --> 01:24:55,850
She.

795
01:24:56,410 --> 01:24:57,410
Dead.

796
01:24:59,950 --> 01:25:01,810
So since that day.

797
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:05,490
I never had a walk in this house.

798
01:25:06,930 --> 01:25:08,120
And that's the room.

799
01:25:08,730 --> 01:25:10,520
That room is not by any of you.

800
01:25:11,290 --> 01:25:12,870
He was hiding from me.

801
01:25:13,880 --> 01:25:15,590
I'm sorry, Ahana.

802
01:25:16,010 --> 01:25:18,000
I could have just told you all this.

803
01:25:19,480 --> 01:25:21,620
But this is the truth in my life.

804
01:25:22,100 --> 01:25:23,950
I want to forget.

805
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:29,160
This is Mayagui's story.

806
01:25:35,110 --> 01:25:38,150
And you're talking about that ghost.

807
01:25:38,510 --> 01:25:39,940
That's Shivani.

808
01:25:40,810 --> 01:25:42,530
Dr Shiwani Roy.

809
01:25:43,420 --> 01:25:45,040
My psychiatrist.

810
01:26:01,310 --> 01:26:02,310
Ahana.

811
01:26:06,020 --> 01:26:07,020
Karan.

812
01:26:08,470 --> 01:26:09,470
Karan.

813
01:26:09,620 --> 01:26:10,620
Karan.

814
01:26:12,240 --> 01:26:13,650
God damn it.

815
01:26:17,960 --> 01:26:20,300
What happened? What happened?

816
01:26:21,110 --> 01:26:22,110
Maya

817
01:26:22,450 --> 01:26:23,450
Maya

818
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:29,110
Maya.

819
01:26:39,160 --> 01:26:41,370
Is she ok, Doctor?
There's nothing to worry about.

820
01:26:41,650 --> 01:26:43,120
It looks like a bad thing.

821
01:26:43,850 --> 01:26:45,226
Can I go with him tomorrow to London?

822
01:26:45,250 --> 01:26:48,140
No, I do not approve of it
She's not fit enough to travel

823
01:26:48,520 --> 01:26:50,520
I'll check in two days.

824
01:26:50,540 --> 01:26:51,540
Two days.

825
01:26:52,350 --> 01:26:53,350
Yes.

826
01:26:53,450 --> 01:26:55,890
Thank you, Doctor - Yes.

827
01:27:08,590 --> 01:27:10,130
Ma'am.

828
01:27:10,670 --> 01:27:13,240
Who's to meet Sarny Maharaja?
A madman is here.

829
01:27:13,420 --> 01:27:16,180
Much to do with Maya's death.

830
01:27:17,180 --> 01:27:20,380
He was not able to save him
She was very honored with the mistake.

831
01:27:22,050 --> 01:27:24,030
He was very impressed by that pressure.

832
01:27:24,450 --> 01:27:27,190
So I got a lot of bad dreams.

833
01:27:27,420 --> 01:27:31,480
Anyone who does that strange sensation
Everything is waiting for everything.

834
01:27:32,130 --> 01:27:34,300
It's always around her
Just like somebody else.

835
01:27:35,720 --> 01:27:36,720
But.

836
01:27:36,970 --> 01:27:40,580
Daily minds with medication
She was very good.

837
01:27:41,490 --> 01:27:42,550
But then,

838
01:27:42,700 --> 01:27:44,180
I brought him back here.

839
01:27:45,620 --> 01:27:47,930
All his problems started again.

840
01:27:48,510 --> 01:27:49,510
Right?

841
01:27:52,440 --> 01:27:53,710
Siva

842
01:27:54,100 --> 01:27:57,050
I mean, Karan's feelings are not the same.

843
01:27:57,220 --> 01:27:58,720
It's true... then.

844
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:00,700
That's it...

845
01:28:01,800 --> 01:28:04,680
I also saw the spirit of the Maya.

846
01:28:05,690 --> 01:28:07,220
- What?
- I also saw him.

847
01:28:07,620 --> 01:28:09,840
That's what happened.

848
01:28:11,610 --> 01:28:13,750
You think you're crazy.

849
01:28:17,410 --> 01:28:18,410
You know Ahana.

850
01:28:18,670 --> 01:28:20,870
Medicine does not accept such talks.

851
01:28:22,160 --> 01:28:24,370
But each coin has both sides.

852
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:26,520
If there is a God,

853
01:28:27,060 --> 01:28:28,060
There is evil.

854
01:28:28,710 --> 01:28:29,970
If you have a good saying,

855
01:28:30,700 --> 01:28:32,230
There's got to be bad.

856
01:28:32,860 --> 01:28:34,020
If there is light,

857
01:28:34,570 --> 01:28:36,320
There's dark too.

858
01:28:38,240 --> 01:28:41,670
I know from a doctor's mouth
It is strange to ask for things.

859
01:28:42,410 --> 01:28:45,310
But the truth is always for us
It just does not look like that.

860
01:28:48,450 --> 01:28:49,850
What is Disease?

861
01:28:50,710 --> 01:28:54,130
No, I do not.

862
01:28:55,210 --> 01:28:58,120
I believe in biology and just as much.

863
01:28:58,350 --> 01:29:00,270
Believe in the strange powers.

864
01:29:01,240 --> 01:29:02,770
That means you trust me.

865
01:29:03,380 --> 01:29:04,660
I believe in God.

866
01:29:05,010 --> 01:29:06,770
So I believe in ghosts.

867
01:29:07,060 --> 01:29:08,060
You

868
01:29:08,260 --> 01:29:10,890
I do not believe in God
So I do not believe in ghosts either.

869
01:29:11,320 --> 01:29:12,320
Is it silly?

870
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:16,160
God did not come before
But I noticed.

871
01:29:17,620 --> 01:29:19,310
I do not know what to do
Ally Shivani.

872
01:29:20,080 --> 01:29:21,940
To a soul that wants revenge.

873
01:29:22,220 --> 01:29:24,990
Or to come to an imperfect desire.

874
01:29:25,750 --> 01:29:27,590
She's very dangerous.

875
01:29:28,600 --> 01:29:32,460
To do the Maid for so long
What's wrong with not doing damage?

876
01:29:33,160 --> 01:29:34,920
Because it's mentally strong.

877
01:29:35,940 --> 01:29:39,050
But this house,
at the place where she died.

878
01:29:40,020 --> 01:29:41,920
His soul is very powerful.

879
01:29:42,690 --> 01:29:44,080
It's too dangerous.

880
01:29:46,140 --> 01:29:48,060
If Maya is back.

881
01:29:48,630 --> 01:29:51,030
He wants to take her with him
It's coming.

882
01:29:51,990 --> 01:29:54,840
Get it to a limit We can go.

883
01:29:56,130 --> 01:29:58,010
He can be a lot worse.

884
01:30:01,170 --> 01:30:03,120
I will not let her
Give me a hurt.

885
01:30:05,890 --> 01:30:07,630
I'm not giving anything to do.

886
01:30:08,520 --> 01:30:09,520
Did you hear Maya?

887
01:30:09,820 --> 01:30:11,150
Careen me

888
01:30:11,350 --> 01:30:13,340
I do not let you take him.

889
01:30:13,790 --> 01:30:15,850
You will never get remedies

890
01:30:16,160 --> 01:30:17,870
I will not let you win

891
01:30:55,220 --> 01:30:56,560
Maya

892
01:30:57,810 --> 01:30:59,090
Maya

893
01:30:59,480 --> 01:31:00,670
Maya.

894
01:31:05,780 --> 01:31:07,950
I know you're here. Maya.

895
01:31:08,210 --> 01:31:10,080
Why come after Karan?

896
01:31:43,960 --> 01:31:46,280
You made a big mistake.

897
01:31:46,620 --> 01:31:48,780
You left the carriers alone, right?

898
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:49,880
Dear God!

899
01:31:52,680 --> 01:31:53,680
Karan.

900
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:01,640
What happened to Ahana?

901
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:04,060
Maya... and he's going to take her!

902
01:32:06,810 --> 01:32:07,810
Karan

903
01:32:13,070 --> 01:32:14,220
do not,

904
01:32:38,680 --> 01:32:40,190
I'm the sage's little sister.

905
01:32:40,720 --> 01:32:41,720
Rūhī.

906
01:32:44,180 --> 01:32:46,000
How did you get in this house?

907
01:32:47,570 --> 01:32:49,160
I was not alone by myself.

908
01:32:49,560 --> 01:32:50,900
I got help.

909
01:32:54,930 --> 01:32:55,930
Gōṭi.

910
01:32:56,540 --> 01:32:58,250
I helped with this.

911
01:32:59,590 --> 01:33:02,130
Because I wanted justice to him

912
01:33:05,070 --> 01:33:08,640
I've been watching this house long ago
But Karan never came.

913
01:33:09,060 --> 01:33:11,700
And he came here to take care of this

914
01:33:11,810 --> 01:33:14,310
I asked him all about him.

915
01:33:15,180 --> 01:33:17,110
Gaulty understood my pain

916
01:33:17,130 --> 01:33:19,270
I was ready to help.

917
01:33:20,170 --> 01:33:21,310
From then on.

918
01:33:21,450 --> 01:33:23,830
We both scared you.

919
01:33:44,450 --> 01:33:47,550
I had the doll you found in the room.

920
01:33:47,880 --> 01:33:49,650
I wanted you to send it to me.

921
01:33:51,280 --> 01:33:53,880
I had to know that bottle
Give me Maya.

922
01:33:54,270 --> 01:33:55,490
Where did you come from?

923
01:33:56,170 --> 01:33:58,740
You were tempted to do something

924
01:33:58,800 --> 01:33:59,200
why?

925
01:33:59,400 --> 01:34:02,370
Because I want revenge
on my sister's death.

926
01:34:07,720 --> 01:34:09,430
Maya's death is not murder

927
01:34:09,470 --> 01:34:10,470
an accident.

928
01:34:10,670 --> 01:34:12,070
Karan did not kill him.

929
01:34:12,180 --> 01:34:13,990
He did not kill her!

930
01:34:15,650 --> 01:34:18,930
He likes you like the rest of you.

931
01:34:19,890 --> 01:34:21,880
All evidence of Maya's death.

932
01:34:21,950 --> 01:34:23,890
To act against.

933
01:34:24,070 --> 01:34:26,210
The family of the Ajmer saved her.

934
01:34:27,240 --> 01:34:30,580
Money and power are people's always
Misuse.

935
01:34:31,100 --> 01:34:32,820
But I know the truth

936
01:34:33,070 --> 01:34:35,520
I'm the one I've always judged

937
01:34:35,880 --> 01:34:37,710
I remember today that night.

938
01:34:41,490 --> 01:34:42,630
Where did you come from?

939
01:34:43,230 --> 01:34:47,590
You all fooled foolishly
It's going to be planned.

940
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:48,620
And.

941
01:34:48,820 --> 01:34:50,300
You are my best brother.

942
01:34:50,390 --> 01:34:51,810
Nobody says anything.

943
01:34:51,880 --> 01:34:54,430
The plan first Then decide.

944
01:34:54,990 --> 01:34:58,700
Rehine, really, make me
From London to come amazed.

945
01:34:59,130 --> 01:35:01,030
No one in his house.

946
01:35:01,180 --> 01:35:03,570
Amazingly alone.

947
01:35:03,720 --> 01:35:05,220
Birthdays.

948
01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:08,920
So now what?

949
01:35:09,060 --> 01:35:11,020
Or are you going to go here or go?

950
01:35:11,090 --> 01:35:14,400
Act really quick
I'll handle it here.

951
01:35:14,700 --> 01:35:16,310
You're good.

952
01:35:22,550 --> 01:35:23,550
Karan.

953
01:35:24,140 --> 01:35:26,130
Um... What happened?

954
01:35:26,530 --> 01:35:27,530
I guess..

955
01:35:28,440 --> 01:35:30,310
There's someone out there.

956
01:35:31,380 --> 01:35:33,010
We were waiting for the longest.

957
01:35:33,960 --> 01:35:35,740
Here, right now

958
01:36:25,950 --> 01:36:27,050
Maya

959
01:36:39,020 --> 01:36:40,620
Maya.

960
01:36:44,660 --> 01:36:45,970
He lied to me.

961
01:36:46,100 --> 01:36:49,170
Not only you He lied to all.

962
01:36:49,590 --> 01:36:51,090
He lied to all.

963
01:36:51,240 --> 01:36:52,960
He said a lot easier.

964
01:36:53,110 --> 01:36:54,490
When she is unconscious.

965
01:36:54,650 --> 01:36:56,690
A third has come up with
the illusion of killing.

966
01:36:57,200 --> 01:36:58,310
But the truth is.

967
01:36:58,460 --> 01:37:01,700
That there was a third person in the police
station I did not receive a testimony.

968
01:37:01,790 --> 01:37:03,400
There was no third person.

969
01:37:04,250 --> 01:37:07,800
And the third of three is why kill magic?

970
01:37:08,470 --> 01:37:10,340
Maya never hurt anyone.

971
01:37:10,840 --> 01:37:12,450
Nobody has thought bad.

972
01:37:12,940 --> 01:37:14,160
So tell me.

973
01:37:14,500 --> 01:37:16,930
Do not kill Magick.

974
01:37:17,370 --> 01:37:19,020
Who has to be.

975
01:37:26,540 --> 01:37:27,540
I know

976
01:37:28,600 --> 01:37:29,730
Samir

977
01:37:30,450 --> 01:37:31,840
Samir - Yes.

978
01:37:31,960 --> 01:37:33,750
Sameer behaved unnecessarily.

979
01:37:33,790 --> 01:37:37,660
After that, Samir after that
I did not try to contact.

980
01:37:38,740 --> 01:37:42,140
I'm sure that Maya should have been killed

981
01:37:42,380 --> 01:37:44,650
Maya saw the third person.

982
01:37:44,670 --> 01:37:46,210
He wants to be a seeder.

983
01:37:46,340 --> 01:37:47,560
It's not possible.

984
01:37:48,570 --> 01:37:49,950
This was not the murder of Sameer

985
01:37:50,270 --> 01:37:51,430
I'm telling you, Sivani.

986
01:37:51,660 --> 01:37:53,190
Sameer was very angry.

987
01:37:53,450 --> 01:37:55,700
This could have been revenge on the Sameer.

988
01:37:55,760 --> 01:37:57,260
That's what she wants to be.

989
01:37:57,780 --> 01:37:59,350
No Ahana... that.

990
01:38:00,540 --> 01:38:01,870
It can not be Samir.

991
01:38:02,170 --> 01:38:04,970
Why are you protecting him?
Why Saemir Can not Be?

992
01:38:05,310 --> 01:38:05,760
I am,

993
01:38:05,810 --> 01:38:08,010
Because Samir was dead tonight.

994
01:38:12,730 --> 01:38:15,410
Sameer acted unnecessarily
with me at night.

995
01:38:16,300 --> 01:38:17,890
I got him out of the house.

996
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:22,121
I have no relationship with him
I did not want to keep it.

997
01:38:22,610 --> 01:38:23,610
But.

998
01:38:39,930 --> 01:38:41,120
Now let me know who.

999
01:38:52,530 --> 01:38:53,530
Karan.

1000
01:39:09,640 --> 01:39:10,640
Karan.

1001
01:39:10,960 --> 01:39:12,410
Stop Samir.

1002
01:39:12,840 --> 01:39:15,130
The devil I'll kill you.

1003
01:39:15,970 --> 01:39:17,740
You do not know who I am.

1004
01:39:17,890 --> 01:39:19,190
You're going to be killed.

1005
01:39:27,580 --> 01:39:28,580
Holy shit!

1006
01:39:29,070 --> 01:39:30,070
I killed her.

1007
01:39:30,840 --> 01:39:31,910
I killed her

1008
01:39:35,660 --> 01:39:36,660
Maya

1009
01:39:36,820 --> 01:39:38,100
Maya does not mind.

1010
01:39:38,310 --> 01:39:39,310
It's okay

1011
01:39:40,610 --> 01:39:42,380
I've put him to death.

1012
01:39:42,700 --> 01:39:43,810
Not anything.

1013
01:39:44,020 --> 01:39:47,350
Sameer has no family or relatives
He's an orphan.

1014
01:39:47,810 --> 01:39:50,091
Everyone knows that he is tomorrow
That he was in Germany.

1015
01:39:50,740 --> 01:39:54,140
We'll put her body on it
Nobody knows anything.

1016
01:40:14,160 --> 01:40:15,970
And then we put her body in here.

1017
01:40:21,230 --> 01:40:23,460
This is the whole story of Karen Alamera.

1018
01:40:26,530 --> 01:40:27,530
Rūhi.

1019
01:40:28,810 --> 01:40:30,450
I did not kill magic.

1020
01:40:31,450 --> 01:40:33,590
I loved him very much.

1021
01:40:35,290 --> 01:40:37,990
I promised him.

1022
01:40:38,240 --> 01:40:40,250
That I will not let her go.

1023
01:40:43,840 --> 01:40:45,610
I could not save him.

1024
01:40:47,360 --> 01:40:49,160
But you still feel that way

1025
01:40:49,380 --> 01:40:51,240
I'm your fault.

1026
01:40:52,980 --> 01:40:54,760
Then I'm sorry.

1027
01:41:08,890 --> 01:41:11,690
Now listen and listen
Nothing is left.

1028
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,800
We will return as soon as tomorrow morning.

1029
01:41:33,560 --> 01:41:34,560
Karan.

1030
01:41:36,380 --> 01:41:37,950
Is not that what's left?

1031
01:41:38,600 --> 01:41:40,000
Is it all over?

1032
01:41:41,580 --> 01:41:43,840
Things that happened... that's the past.

1033
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:45,510
It's over.

1034
01:41:45,880 --> 01:41:47,740
But that's what... the present.

1035
01:41:48,310 --> 01:41:50,220
Then be things to be

1036
01:41:50,550 --> 01:41:51,550
the future.

1037
01:41:52,460 --> 01:41:54,410
Want to finish it?

1038
01:41:58,910 --> 01:42:01,380
My present... Only the future is Ahana.

1039
01:42:03,670 --> 01:42:05,500
I lied to you.

1040
01:42:05,690 --> 01:42:07,670
Hiding many things.

1041
01:42:08,940 --> 01:42:11,840
After that, you can not even think of us...

1042
01:42:14,210 --> 01:42:15,210
today.

1043
01:42:15,790 --> 01:42:17,590
After I know the whole truth,

1044
01:42:18,460 --> 01:42:21,210
My trust strengthened you.

1045
01:42:21,750 --> 01:42:24,350
I totally live my whole life.

1046
01:42:24,580 --> 01:42:26,810
You just have to pay with it.

1047
01:42:28,540 --> 01:42:30,760
Before my answer, yes...

1048
01:42:31,730 --> 01:42:33,600
It's still the same today.

1049
01:42:35,570 --> 01:42:40,130
But you're asking me about this question
I would like to ask.

1050
01:42:48,720 --> 01:42:50,060
Will you marry me?

1051
01:43:19,420 --> 01:43:20,720
What happened?

1052
01:43:21,090 --> 01:43:22,090
What happened?

1053
01:43:53,840 --> 01:43:55,980
I think we should leave here.

1054
01:43:56,130 --> 01:43:57,760
This is not a man's business.

1055
01:43:59,420 --> 01:44:01,670
You mean this house is really
There is a soul.

1056
01:44:01,760 --> 01:44:03,330
It's like real ghosts

1057
01:44:27,230 --> 01:44:28,850
I'll check.

1058
01:44:31,580 --> 01:44:33,050
Please.

1059
01:44:33,570 --> 01:44:35,260
Please... let's get out of here.

1060
01:44:37,060 --> 01:44:38,950
For years I was scared of my fears.

1061
01:44:41,360 --> 01:44:45,740
For the first time today, I have gone
before my fears It needs to face that.

1062
01:44:47,950 --> 01:44:49,570
I need to do this.

1063
01:44:57,980 --> 01:44:58,980
Rūhī.

1064
01:45:00,070 --> 01:45:03,240
Ahana, you're left at Rihína
I'll get him a water.

1065
01:45:03,280 --> 01:45:04,280
But Shivani

1066
01:45:04,550 --> 01:45:05,550
do not be scared.

1067
01:45:06,310 --> 01:45:07,310
There is this blessing.

1068
01:45:07,630 --> 01:45:09,480
This will not happen to me.

1069
01:45:10,210 --> 01:45:11,210
Take care.

1070
01:45:14,390 --> 01:45:15,880
Ahana.

1071
01:45:17,210 --> 01:45:17,770
Karan.

1072
01:45:18,090 --> 01:45:21,240
No... do not go... please...
Please do not go Ahana...

1073
01:45:21,390 --> 01:45:22,390
Help.

1074
01:45:22,700 --> 01:45:23,700
Please.

1075
01:45:23,860 --> 01:45:24,860
Karan.

1076
01:45:26,770 --> 01:45:27,770
Karan.

1077
01:46:31,540 --> 01:46:32,540
Rūhī.

1078
01:46:33,960 --> 01:46:35,020
Rūhī.

1079
01:46:39,420 --> 01:46:40,420
Holy shit.

1080
01:46:44,100 --> 01:46:45,470
Let's go.

1081
01:46:49,710 --> 01:46:51,230
Wait, - What happened?

1082
01:46:51,300 --> 01:46:52,310
Karen

1083
01:46:52,440 --> 01:46:53,440
I can not leave him.

1084
01:46:53,560 --> 01:46:56,020
Ahana he's coming. Let's go
Come with me now.

1085
01:46:56,040 --> 01:46:57,590
No... Karan.

1086
01:46:57,880 --> 01:46:59,270
Karan.

1087
01:47:00,330 --> 01:47:01,330
Ahana

1088
01:47:03,690 --> 01:47:06,090
Khan, you were I was scared.

1089
01:47:06,260 --> 01:47:07,630
Rūhīt.

1090
01:47:24,110 --> 01:47:25,390
Now it's your turn.

1091
01:47:32,180 --> 01:47:34,260
Leave him... Leave.

1092
01:47:34,580 --> 01:47:35,580
Leave.

1093
01:47:37,580 --> 01:47:38,820
Leave him.

1094
01:47:54,950 --> 01:47:56,640
This room is protected from the spells.

1095
01:47:57,020 --> 01:47:58,450
He can not come here.

1096
01:47:58,880 --> 01:48:00,000
We are safe here.

1097
01:48:01,420 --> 01:48:03,110
What's Shivani doing?

1098
01:48:04,050 --> 01:48:06,050
I do not understand anything.

1099
01:48:07,190 --> 01:48:09,560
How's Samir coming back?

1100
01:48:12,430 --> 01:48:14,420
Sameer has not returned yet.

1101
01:48:15,390 --> 01:48:16,920
He's never gone

1102
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:21,020
Karen for eight years for the Samir's soul
There's inside.

1103
01:48:22,280 --> 01:48:23,280
And today.

1104
01:48:23,590 --> 01:48:25,890
On the upcoming day, this place is back.

1105
01:48:27,170 --> 01:48:28,870
She's very powerful.

1106
01:48:30,110 --> 01:48:32,960
That's why he did it completely
It's closed.

1107
01:48:44,510 --> 01:48:46,910
You really understood Shivani.

1108
01:48:47,630 --> 01:48:49,900
But it's too late.

1109
01:48:52,120 --> 01:48:55,910
I'm going into the body
Make mistakes.

1110
01:48:56,460 --> 01:48:57,460
But do it.

1111
01:48:57,840 --> 01:48:59,760
She really cares about love.

1112
01:49:00,580 --> 01:49:02,540
Propose that marriage.

1113
01:49:05,280 --> 01:49:07,270
A year... two do not mind.

1114
01:49:07,750 --> 01:49:08,750
But marriage.

1115
01:49:09,360 --> 01:49:11,460
With all your life, with one girl.

1116
01:49:12,420 --> 01:49:13,420
Not at all.

1117
01:49:14,990 --> 01:49:16,720
That's why I killed Maya.

1118
01:49:25,030 --> 01:49:26,030
Karan.

1119
01:49:37,210 --> 01:49:38,370
Aduragattada?

1120
01:49:38,700 --> 01:49:39,870
I'm back.

1121
01:49:42,100 --> 01:49:44,470
Innocently he cried.

1122
01:49:44,910 --> 01:49:46,540
It's possible.

1123
01:49:48,370 --> 01:49:50,350
Sameer Maya was killed.

1124
01:49:50,900 --> 01:49:54,190
Listen, let's get out of this house
You have to find a way, okay?

1125
01:49:54,770 --> 01:49:56,510
You have done the job.

1126
01:49:56,590 --> 01:49:58,720
He's not Kran He is Samir Ahana.

1127
01:49:58,850 --> 01:50:00,930
No, the Samir inherited it.

1128
01:50:01,210 --> 01:50:02,750
But do it yourself

1129
01:50:02,980 --> 01:50:05,470
I love her I'm not leaving him.

1130
01:50:06,340 --> 01:50:07,800
Please help me, Shivani.

1131
01:50:12,490 --> 01:50:14,070
Holy shit.

1132
01:50:16,310 --> 01:50:17,660
That body.

1133
01:50:18,020 --> 01:50:19,020
Hey?

1134
01:50:19,470 --> 01:50:20,470
Body.

1135
01:50:20,540 --> 01:50:22,790
Samir's body is Ahana.

1136
01:50:23,200 --> 01:50:25,810
A soul can not be inherited
directly from a soul.

1137
01:50:26,060 --> 01:50:28,780
It's just something from the marble
Comes with the body!

1138
01:50:29,650 --> 01:50:32,000
We have Samir's body burned.

1139
01:50:32,240 --> 01:50:33,520
But.

1140
01:50:37,790 --> 01:50:38,790
Do you hear him?

1141
01:50:40,010 --> 01:50:41,010
Not.

1142
01:50:43,830 --> 01:50:45,480
This is our chance.

1143
01:50:46,600 --> 01:50:48,800
We have to hurry our work.

1144
01:50:49,740 --> 01:50:52,040
We're not going to be anymore, okay?

1145
01:50:52,960 --> 01:50:55,560
Something to burn in here
Definitely.

1146
01:50:56,570 --> 01:50:58,270
Come with me... come on.

1147
01:51:09,420 --> 01:51:10,420
Ahana.

1148
01:51:10,670 --> 01:51:12,980
You told me everyday
I'm with you.

1149
01:51:13,470 --> 01:51:15,800
This Samer will not let me live.

1150
01:51:16,100 --> 01:51:17,100
Please...

1151
01:51:17,240 --> 01:51:18,700
Help me.

1152
01:51:18,960 --> 01:51:19,960
Please help me.

1153
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,200
He is torturing himself.
No. No, Ahana.

1154
01:51:23,240 --> 01:51:24,360
Please do not listen to him,

1155
01:51:24,380 --> 01:51:27,140
Do not listen to him
He's playing with your mind.

1156
01:51:27,260 --> 01:51:29,890
Ahana will die because of this peace.

1157
01:51:30,480 --> 01:51:32,840
Please come closer to me... please.

1158
01:51:49,630 --> 01:51:52,340
First we have to leave here
Let's go.

1159
01:52:09,210 --> 01:52:10,420
Trust this.

1160
01:52:10,880 --> 01:52:14,560
This is for you, Sameer
You can not even carry a hand.

1161
01:52:14,990 --> 01:52:17,140
Exceptions are fulfilled
When you have faith.

1162
01:52:17,410 --> 01:52:20,130
Trust this is protecting you.

1163
01:52:20,200 --> 01:52:21,200
Right?

1164
01:52:21,280 --> 01:52:22,710
Oh, God... Let's go.

1165
01:52:47,990 --> 01:52:49,670
Slowly slowly...

1166
01:52:49,750 --> 01:52:52,300
Tell me this moment is coming
Slowly... slowly.

1167
01:52:52,450 --> 01:52:55,330
Let's go slowly.

1168
01:52:55,770 --> 01:52:58,740
But empty-handed.

1169
01:53:01,990 --> 01:53:03,860
From what I've been waiting...

1170
01:53:04,780 --> 01:53:06,590
How far did you go?

1171
01:53:09,540 --> 01:53:10,540
Come on.

1172
01:53:11,030 --> 01:53:12,030
Come closer.

1173
01:53:12,330 --> 01:53:14,150
Come quickly... quickly.

1174
01:53:15,300 --> 01:53:17,040
Do not burn your body.

1175
01:53:23,300 --> 01:53:24,560
No no, Karen.

1176
01:53:24,770 --> 01:53:26,500
There is no one else.

1177
01:53:26,850 --> 01:53:28,840
It's all on your head.

1178
01:53:30,840 --> 01:53:32,170
Double the dose.

1179
01:53:32,310 --> 01:53:33,630
Be strong

1180
01:53:36,020 --> 01:53:37,330
Sarah Kant

1181
01:53:37,420 --> 01:53:39,390
I am his strength.

1182
01:53:40,520 --> 01:53:41,840
Ask Ahana.

1183
01:53:42,120 --> 01:53:44,250
The lion is telling me this is me.

1184
01:53:44,590 --> 01:53:45,590
Oh, Ahana.

1185
01:53:46,080 --> 01:53:47,830
How much I loved you.

1186
01:53:48,230 --> 01:53:49,740
Count it.

1187
01:53:49,840 --> 01:53:51,840
In the shower.

1188
01:53:52,030 --> 01:53:54,280
Show my favorite heart to the doctor.

1189
01:53:56,980 --> 01:53:59,220
Come on... come with me.

1190
01:53:59,950 --> 01:54:02,850
Come on... I have a coffin for you
Getting ready.

1191
01:54:03,130 --> 01:54:04,300
Come on.

1192
01:54:11,990 --> 01:54:14,220
Ahana... do not go Ahana.

1193
01:54:14,640 --> 01:54:17,030
Do not ask a soul,
or listen to what he says.

1194
01:54:17,330 --> 01:54:18,460
Do not listen to him,

1195
01:54:18,930 --> 01:54:19,930
Ahana...

1196
01:54:20,360 --> 01:54:21,360
Stay.

1197
01:54:21,590 --> 01:54:22,590
Please.

1198
01:54:22,640 --> 01:54:25,060
Ahana... do not listen to him.

1199
01:54:25,520 --> 01:54:26,606
Come on.
Please do not listen to him.

1200
01:54:26,630 --> 01:54:27,630
Come on.

1201
01:54:27,880 --> 01:54:28,980
Ahana...

1202
01:54:40,950 --> 01:54:43,150
Shivani, quickly fire.

1203
01:55:00,820 --> 01:55:01,820
Siva.

1204
01:55:05,690 --> 01:55:07,350
Ahana...

1205
01:55:33,150 --> 01:55:34,150
Ahana...

1206
01:55:34,390 --> 01:55:36,500
It means that the soul is with the body
Not married!

1207
01:55:36,740 --> 01:55:39,380
There's something else
Add Sameer with Karen.

1208
01:55:39,490 --> 01:55:40,490
Find it.

1209
01:55:40,610 --> 01:55:43,980
After that, you were done
Let's get saved.

1210
01:55:44,290 --> 01:55:45,540
Go.

1211
01:56:32,220 --> 01:56:33,220
Karan.

1212
01:56:33,270 --> 01:56:35,160
Will you save?

1213
01:56:35,240 --> 01:56:37,680
I do not believe in God
So I do not even believe in the ghost.

1214
01:56:37,740 --> 01:56:39,920
Exceptions are fulfilled
When you have faith.

1215
01:56:40,160 --> 01:56:41,160
Trust me.

1216
01:56:42,180 --> 01:56:44,950
Oh, my God, my God Help me.

1217
01:56:49,810 --> 01:56:51,210
Please help me.

1218
01:57:21,610 --> 01:57:22,920
What happened?

1219
01:57:24,500 --> 01:57:26,850
I hate this sound.

1220
01:59:26,050 --> 01:59:27,100
Karan.

1221
01:59:28,680 --> 01:59:29,680
Ahana.

1222
01:59:29,840 --> 01:59:32,340
What's going on?
Sameer's spirit's inside your body.

1223
01:59:32,900 --> 01:59:34,470
That's what killed Majesty.

1224
01:59:34,670 --> 01:59:38,030
She's a Haiti rie
Shivani was also killed.

1225
01:59:39,060 --> 01:59:40,960
Now he wanted to kill me.

1226
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,870
We burn her body.

1227
01:59:45,020 --> 01:59:47,410
But he did not die.

1228
01:59:47,970 --> 01:59:50,450
There's something else for him
Stay with you.

1229
01:59:50,610 --> 01:59:52,490
What the fuck?

1230
01:59:53,010 --> 01:59:54,160
Remind me.

1231
01:59:54,510 --> 01:59:57,000
What do you have, Sameer?

1232
02:00:27,660 --> 02:00:29,970
I know what that is.

1233
02:00:38,660 --> 02:00:40,660
Sameer is bound with me.

1234
02:00:41,230 --> 02:00:42,230
That's the mark.

1235
02:00:42,510 --> 02:00:44,440
At the time of his death, he gave me.

1236
02:00:45,570 --> 02:00:47,310
Then remove this mark.

1237
02:00:48,130 --> 02:00:49,720
The only way.

1238
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:55,630
I have to lose myself.

1239
02:01:00,330 --> 02:01:01,330
Karan.

1240
02:01:02,870 --> 02:01:04,040
Stay.

1241
02:01:06,630 --> 02:01:07,750
Karan.

1242
02:01:10,750 --> 02:01:12,280
Do not do it.

1243
02:01:16,950 --> 02:01:18,020
Karan.

1244
02:01:21,640 --> 02:01:23,590
Ahana will not let him win.

1245
02:01:26,240 --> 02:01:27,240
Ahana.

1246
02:02:05,740 --> 02:02:06,860
Karan

1247
02:02:43,740 --> 02:02:45,030
do not!

1248
02:02:59,490 --> 02:03:01,840
Please do not!
