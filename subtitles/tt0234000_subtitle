26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,750
Rohit!

27
00:01:56,833 --> 00:01:59,541
Rohit!

28
00:01:59,625 --> 00:02:04,125
Rohit!

29
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:07,166
Rohit!

30
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:47,041
Amit! Hey, Amit!

31
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:51,375
Get up or you'll get late for school.

32
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:55,500
Brother, have you forgotten that it's Sunday today?

33
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:57,333
You also go back to sleep.

34
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:00,375
Is it Sunday today?
- Yes.

35
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:03,072
I'm sorry.

36
00:04:03,098 --> 00:04:05,416
I unnecessarily woke you up.

37
00:04:05,442 --> 00:04:06,483
Go to sleep.

38
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:09,583
Where are these kids!

39
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:10,689
They'll come.

40
00:04:10,715 --> 00:04:12,525
- Good morning, Uncle.

41
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:14,541
Good morning, Rohit.

42
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:15,926
Good morning, Aunt.

43
00:04:15,952 --> 00:04:17,525
- Good morning, Rohit.

44
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:19,831
You didn't bring you younger brother.

45
00:04:19,857 --> 00:04:20,441
Where is he?

46
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,958
Aunt, have you also forgotten that it is Sunday?
Sunday.

47
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,989
He's sleeping.

48
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:28,191
- Does Sunday come two days in advance now?

49
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,583
What! - He fooled you.

50
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:33,250
He made a fool of me?

51
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:34,492
He's very naughty.

52
00:04:34,518 --> 00:04:37,608
Wake him quickly or he'll get late for school.

53
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:41,125
There's just one advantage of getting retired.

54
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:45,291
It makes no difference whether it's a Friday or a Sunday!

55
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:48,416
Amit! You fooled me!

56
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,125
You say it's a Sunday on a Friday! You lie!

57
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:53,583
Brother, a small lie is fine, isn't it?

58
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:55,083
That too, early in the morning!

59
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:57,000
Shall I say something?
- Yes.

60
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:59,208
Anybody can fool you!

61
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:01,416
Why? Is it apparent on my face?

62
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,958
Because you are too innocent and simple as well.

63
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,090
Why insult me in installments?

64
00:05:07,116 --> 00:05:09,066
Can't you say it in one go?

65
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:12,000
I enjoy teasing you.

66
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:14,583
Really? You enjoy teasing me?!

67
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:16,265
Shall I say something?

68
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:17,816
When you tease me,..

69
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:19,625
..even I enjoy it a lot!

70
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:29,354
Good morning, Uncle.

71
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,275
Good morning, Aunt.

72
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:31,382
Good morning, child.

73
00:05:31,408 --> 00:05:32,543
- Good morning. Come.

74
00:05:32,569 --> 00:05:33,216
Please sit.

75
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:36,416
What aroma! I think aunt has prepared omelete today.

76
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:40,000
See?
- Brother, aunt is very great.

77
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:43,791
With the omelette, she butters & applies jam on the bread, too!

78
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:44,602
Hey, Amit!

79
00:05:44,628 --> 00:05:46,055
Stop buttering me.

80
00:05:46,081 --> 00:05:47,733
There's no jam today.

81
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:48,616
No problem.

82
00:05:48,642 --> 00:05:51,941
Brother will buy me a chocolate on the way.

83
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:53,085
Aunt, did you see that?

84
00:05:53,111 --> 00:05:54,608
After you, I'm his next target!

85
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:56,666
Indeed!
He is very smart!

86
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,333
He knows how to get his work done!

87
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:01,166
Shall I say something?

88
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:04,583
If you have to survive in this world, you've got to be smart!

89
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:07,541
And to be smart, it's very important to eat chicken.

90
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:10,291
Oh! I understand!

91
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:13,208
I'll surely prepare chicken for you in the evening.

92
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:16,187
Uncle, what does the newspaper say today?

93
00:06:16,213 --> 00:06:17,275
How many people..

94
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:19,625
Forget that. Rohit, there's a good news for you.

95
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:21,916
Your boss, the owner of that five star hotel..

96
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,416
..wants to hire a singer for the night.

97
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,389
Look, he's advertised for it.

98
00:06:24,415 --> 00:06:25,150
Why don't you try, man?

99
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:27,125
Hey! How many jobs will this child do?!

100
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:29,125
You remain idle but employ others!

101
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:30,180
As it is, he works in the day.

102
00:06:30,206 --> 00:06:31,275
Will he work in the night, too?!

103
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:32,625
Lady!

104
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:36,458
For once in your life, just listen to what your man says!

105
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:39,583
The job that he does in the day is his livelihood.

106
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:44,250
But he'll do this job in order to fulfil his dream.

107
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:47,000
What will you understand, you domesticated woman?!

108
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:50,750
Music brings happiness to life!

109
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:53,458
Music is the food for life.

110
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:47,000
"He stepped into my motor shop, it's the grace of God"

111
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:49,416
"Sometimes, I'd see him, And he.."

112
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,694
What are the wordings?

113
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,316
Forget it!

114
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:53,750
It's great that you have come here, Sirjee.

115
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:57,166
You have changed all your habits but you still call me Sirjee!

116
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,958
Oh, I forget! Tell me, what brings you here?

117
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,977
I want a car.

118
00:09:01,003 --> 00:09:01,980
- Forget car.

119
00:09:02,006 --> 00:09:04,258
I can even give you my life!

120
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:06,955
Rohit, come here.

121
00:09:06,981 --> 00:09:08,066
- Yes, sir.

122
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:09,534
He's my star salesman!

123
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:12,441
One look at him, and the girls buy the car!

124
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,014
And he is my best friend!

125
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,358
My companion, my buddy, Saxena!

126
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:21,625
He is a millionaire. Show him a splendid car.

127
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:23,750
Yes, sir. Please come.

128
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:26,750
You are fortunate that various new models have started coming to India.

129
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,531
Look at this - a Lexus GS-300.

130
00:09:28,557 --> 00:09:29,858
It's the latest model.

131
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:32,625
Please take it, sir.

132
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:34,236
It's nice but..

133
00:09:34,262 --> 00:09:36,066
- Then, please come here, sir.

134
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:38,294
The Mercedes, C-180.

135
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,525
It's automatic..

136
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:42,458
..and it's colour suits your personality, cent percent!

137
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,791
Take it, sir.

138
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:48,000
What kind of a car would you like to buy?

139
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:49,625
An auto rickshaw, sir.

140
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:52,250
Not you. I know that you will buy only an auto rickshaw!

141
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:57,708
You!
- Sir, if I had the money, I would have liked to buy that car.

142
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:01,833
Look, sir. It's small and zooms, too!

143
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:03,271
That's more like it!

144
00:10:03,297 --> 00:10:04,525
- Then buy it, sir.

145
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:06,875
I have. It's mine!

146
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:10,666
Rohit, you've spoken to your boss for the job of a singer, haven't you?

147
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,750
Yes, but his son, Atul, handles the hotel business.

148
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:15,458
We'll have to speak to him.

149
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:17,083
Come in, Rohit.

150
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,250
I will call you later. Bye.

151
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:20,583
Come.

152
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:23,503
Dad had called me.

153
00:10:23,529 --> 00:10:25,691
Both of you are here for a singer's job, right?

154
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,500
Yes, sir.
- Please listen to us.

155
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:28,266
All right.

156
00:10:28,292 --> 00:10:31,025
Get your band, and I'll take the audition.

157
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:34,083
Band?
- Yes, your band.

158
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:39,458
We have no band. I sing, and Tony plays the flute.

159
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:41,208
Please hear us, sir.

160
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:43,791
Look here, friends. This is a five star hotel.

161
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:47,833
All the musical shows here have a band.

162
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:49,130
Electronic gadgets, synthesizers..

163
00:10:49,156 --> 00:10:50,441
That's what works in today's world!

164
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,833
Please hear us, sir.

165
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:52,699
No way, buddy.

166
00:10:52,725 --> 00:10:54,233
This is a hotel business.

167
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:56,097
It's the question of our reputation.

168
00:10:56,123 --> 00:10:57,025
It is not a joke.

169
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:57,883
I am sorry.

170
00:10:57,909 --> 00:11:00,441
I would advice you to go and try in a restaurant.

171
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,199
Good luck.

172
00:11:01,225 --> 00:11:02,483
- Thank you, sir.

173
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:14,333
Daddy, what is all this?

174
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:16,698
Happy birthday to you.

175
00:11:16,724 --> 00:11:19,108
Happy birthday to you.

176
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:22,316
Happy birthday, dear Sonia.

177
00:11:22,342 --> 00:11:25,025
Happy birthday to you.

178
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,223
Happy, birthday, my darling.

179
00:11:28,249 --> 00:11:29,733
- This is a real surprise, Daddy.

180
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:30,597
Anything for you.

181
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:32,566
What's your programme for this evening?

182
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:35,041
Atul is giving a party in my honour at his outhouse.

183
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:36,391
That's fantastic.

184
00:11:36,417 --> 00:11:37,460
- That's fine.

185
00:11:37,486 --> 00:11:40,091
But where is my birthday present?

186
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:43,041
It awaits you at the door, my child!

187
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:46,375
Really?
- Go and enjoy your gift!

188
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:48,500
You are so sweet, Daddy.

189
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:53,000
Hello.

190
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:04,416
How's the gift, Sonia?

191
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,041
Extremely beautiful!

192
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:16,375
How's the colour?

193
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:25,958
Clean and immaculate, Daddy!

194
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,083
Why don't you take a ride?

195
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,166
Do you function with a key?

196
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,166
That depends on your temperament.

197
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:37,083
What! I don't understand such difficult words!

198
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:40,708
I know. Will you please take a look at your present now?

199
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:42,375
I already am.

200
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:59,791
Wow! What a beauty?

201
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:01,082
What do you think?

202
00:13:01,108 --> 00:13:02,650
- It's very beautiful.

203
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:06,000
But please don't ruin it with fake embellishments.

204
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:08,500
Because true beauty lies in simplicity.

205
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:11,750
Point noted. Mr.. - Rohit.

206
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,875
Excuse me, Miss.. - Sonia.

207
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:20,916
Happy birthday. - Thank you.

208
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,854
What happened to the flute?

209
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,483
- It was fine a while ago.

210
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:36,958
Come on, play it.

211
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,708
Who is it! Should I give you one!

212
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:52,708
Thank you.
Go over there.

213
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:57,125
Hey, Rohit! Isn't he our boss' son?

214
00:13:58,291 --> 00:13:59,625
Oh, yes!

215
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:04,166
He didn't want to hear us sing but he will have no choice now!

216
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,583
How?

217
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:08,458
Got it?

218
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:14,541
Happy birthday, Sonia. - Hi!

219
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:17,492
Thank you.

220
00:14:17,518 --> 00:14:19,483
- Many happy returns of the day, Sonia.

221
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:21,175
Thank you.

222
00:14:21,201 --> 00:14:22,015
- Happy birthday.

223
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:23,441
- Thank you so much. Thanks.

224
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,750
Hi. - Hi, Sonia. - Hi.

225
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:28,025
Many happy returns of the day.

226
00:14:28,051 --> 00:14:28,566
- Thank you.

227
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:30,166
Looking very pretty.

228
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,291
I have never seen you dressed this way before.

229
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:36,625
Yes, even I realised today that beauty lies in simplicity.

230
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:38,458
Really? - Yes.

231
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:44,541
Hey!
What's the matter with the sound?

232
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:46,750
Excuse me, Sonia, I'll go and check.
- Yes.

233
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:49,333
Music! Music! Music!

234
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,083
Rohit!

235
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:09,000
"The moon and stars. Flowers and fragrance ."

236
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:16,041
"The moon and stars. Flowers and fragrance are all outdated."

237
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:19,000
"A new bud has bloomed."

238
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:22,250
"I am crazy about her."

239
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:38,500
"Clouds, the rains.. The monsoons.."

240
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:44,826
"Clouds, the rains..

241
00:16:44,852 --> 00:16:48,441
The monsoons are all bygones."

242
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,291
"A new bud has bloomed."

243
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:54,333
"I am crazy about her."

244
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:43,958
"She has new styles."

245
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
"My craziness for her is new, too."

246
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:55,541
"She has new styles."

247
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:58,416
"My craziness for her is new too."

248
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,875
"She has worn the crown of youth."

249
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:05,791
"Her childhood has passed happily."

250
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:16,375
"Songs and hymns are all outdated."

251
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:25,208
"Songs and hymns are all outdated, she has her new songs."

252
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:28,083
"A new bud has bloomed."

253
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:31,208
"I am crazy about her."

254
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:20,833
"Her face is so simple."

255
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:24,833
"..how beautiful her soul must be!"

256
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:32,458
"Her face is so simple.."

257
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:35,208
"..how beautiful her soul must be!"

258
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:38,750
"Without any jewellery or make-up.."

259
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:42,541
".. she looks like a bride."

260
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:52,875
"Kohl, bindis, bangles, ear-ring.."

261
00:19:55,875 --> 00:20:02,041
"Kohl, bindis, bangles, ear-ring are all ancient."

262
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:05,000
"A new bud has bloomed."

263
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:08,000
"I am crazy about her."

264
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:33,319
"The moon and stars..

265
00:20:33,345 --> 00:20:37,233
Flowers and fragrance all are outdated."

266
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:40,083
"A new bud has bloomed."

267
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:43,666
"I am crazy about her."

268
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:29,883
What is the matter?

269
00:21:29,909 --> 00:21:31,400
Why did you call me here?

270
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,500
Because we are in trouble.

271
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,791
I think you have not read the newspapers.

272
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:39,708
The drugs that the police were to burn tonight got burnt last night.

273
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:41,333
Got burnt! - Yes.

274
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:43,849
But I've taken advance from the party already!

275
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:44,650
- Don't worry.

276
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:49,666
We've managed to salvage narcotics worth Rs.100 million.

277
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:53,208
We are worried that somebody may find out.

278
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:56,583
So have those drugs taken away today itself.

279
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:59,416
And give us our share.

280
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,833
Share! Share!!

281
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:05,958
Like always, you will get your share even this time!

282
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:10,625
Lily, hear this!

283
00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:13,375
The drugs worth millions which the police had seized..

284
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:16,958
.. were burnt last night by them.

285
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,075
Disgusting!

286
00:22:18,101 --> 00:22:19,281
I know it all!

287
00:22:19,307 --> 00:22:22,425
They print this only to deceive us!

288
00:22:22,458 --> 00:22:24,708
You're worried about the whole world..

289
00:22:24,791 --> 00:22:26,750
..but not about what we are going to cook at home!

290
00:22:26,833 --> 00:22:30,041
Will I boil the newspaper and prepare noodles of it?!

291
00:22:30,125 --> 00:22:33,750
Rohit hasn't paid this month's rent or the money for food!

292
00:22:33,833 --> 00:22:35,791
How am I supposed to manage?!

293
00:22:35,875 --> 00:22:36,884
What're you saying!

294
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:39,191
If he hasn't yet paid, he will pay later!

295
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,806
He, himself, must have not got his pay.

296
00:22:40,832 --> 00:22:42,108
The expenses are very high now!

297
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:44,470
That's exactly what I'm saying!

298
00:22:44,496 --> 00:22:46,650
The prices have skyrocketed!

299
00:22:46,708 --> 00:22:49,833
Everybody comes to eat, but how am I supposed to manage?

300
00:22:51,333 --> 00:22:51,954
What's this?

301
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:52,858
- My piggy bank.

302
00:22:52,916 --> 00:22:56,125
Take all the money but don't speak ill about brother!

303
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,341
What did you say!

304
00:22:57,367 --> 00:22:58,566
What did you say!

305
00:22:59,375 --> 00:23:03,083
A small boy like you flaunts money to me!

306
00:23:03,166 --> 00:23:04,197
What do you think I am!

307
00:23:04,223 --> 00:23:05,566
Come on, eat your breakfast!

308
00:23:05,625 --> 00:23:06,847
No! I don't want to eat!

309
00:23:06,873 --> 00:23:07,941
I don't want to eat.

310
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,708
Hey, Amit! Listen!..

311
00:23:10,791 --> 00:23:11,833
Come back!

312
00:23:11,859 --> 00:23:14,150
- Amit, listen to me!

313
00:23:14,875 --> 00:23:16,375
What's the matter, Aunty?

314
00:23:16,458 --> 00:23:18,750
Amit is angry with me.

315
00:23:19,208 --> 00:23:22,333
He didn't even have breakfast; he's left like that only.

316
00:23:23,208 --> 00:23:24,708
I'll go and see.

317
00:23:41,583 --> 00:23:45,458
Amit, why did you leave without having your breakfast?

318
00:23:45,541 --> 00:23:46,426
Aunt is so upset.

319
00:23:46,452 --> 00:23:47,441
What's the matter?

320
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:50,375
Then why does she talk ill about you?

321
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:52,458
What did she say?

322
00:23:52,541 --> 00:23:54,916
That you haven't paid her.

323
00:23:55,583 --> 00:23:57,012
She isn't wrong.

324
00:23:57,038 --> 00:23:59,983
- Yet, I don't approve of that.

325
00:24:00,583 --> 00:24:04,250
Amit, there's something called helplessness.

326
00:24:04,333 --> 00:24:08,291
I'm helpless because I'm unable to pay aunt.

327
00:24:08,708 --> 00:24:11,458
And she is helpless because she doesn't have money to run the house.

328
00:24:11,541 --> 00:24:15,583
You have seen her temper, not her tears.

329
00:24:16,166 --> 00:24:17,750
She is like our mother.

330
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:20,000
Like our mother, but she's not our mother.

331
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:24,625
But she is no less than a mother.

332
00:24:24,708 --> 00:24:28,416
Brother, why did our mother leave us?

333
00:24:29,791 --> 00:24:31,041
What do I say?

334
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:35,250
The truth is that even I don't know.

335
00:24:36,625 --> 00:24:38,166
Perhaps it was our destiny.

336
00:24:39,625 --> 00:24:43,333
First, mother left us, and then, father did.

337
00:24:44,666 --> 00:24:46,625
Perhaps it was God's will.

338
00:24:48,958 --> 00:24:51,500
But I promise you one thing.

339
00:24:51,583 --> 00:24:55,750
I will never ever let you feel their absence.

340
00:25:09,333 --> 00:25:10,653
He loves me.

341
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:12,108
He hates me.

342
00:25:12,333 --> 00:25:14,791
He loves me. He hates me.

343
00:25:14,875 --> 00:25:17,083
Whom are you doing this for?

344
00:25:17,166 --> 00:25:20,250
Guess. - Rohit, of course.

345
00:25:20,333 --> 00:25:21,750
How did you know?

346
00:25:21,776 --> 00:25:23,275
- Come on, dumbo!

347
00:25:23,333 --> 00:25:27,458
The way both of you were looking at each other last night..

348
00:25:27,541 --> 00:25:29,333
Anybody in the world can guess.

349
00:25:29,416 --> 00:25:31,413
Sending messages with the eyes!

350
00:25:31,439 --> 00:25:32,275
Am I right?

351
00:25:32,958 --> 00:25:34,396
A little. - Atul. Boys.

352
00:25:34,422 --> 00:25:36,358
The cruise tickets have come.

353
00:25:37,958 --> 00:25:39,375
Yours and yours.

354
00:25:39,458 --> 00:25:43,041
The cruise leaves exactly at 9 O'clock for Singapore. Okay?
- Okay.

355
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:45,291
But I don't want to come.

356
00:25:45,375 --> 00:25:46,017
What!

357
00:25:46,043 --> 00:25:47,191
- Come on, Sonia.

358
00:25:47,217 --> 00:25:48,633
Don't spoil the fun.

359
00:25:48,666 --> 00:25:50,166
But I'm not in the mood!

360
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:51,781
Fine! Don't come!

361
00:25:51,807 --> 00:25:53,608
Neither will Rohit!

362
00:25:54,208 --> 00:25:55,133
What? Rohit?

363
00:25:55,159 --> 00:25:58,858
- Yes! Rohit will also be coming with us on the cruise.

364
00:25:58,916 --> 00:26:01,125
I've engaged him as a singer.

365
00:26:01,208 --> 00:26:03,500
Are you sure Rohit is coming? - Am I?

366
00:26:03,583 --> 00:26:05,958
I have already paid him Rs.10,000 as advance money.

367
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,708
You're coming now, aren't you?

368
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,291
When did I ever refuse!

369
00:26:21,833 --> 00:26:23,205
Rohit has still not come!

370
00:26:23,231 --> 00:26:24,108
Now what, Atul?

371
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:25,666
It's time for the ship to leave.

372
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,278
Suppose he doesn't come, then?

373
00:26:27,304 --> 00:26:28,525
- Stop talking rubbish!

374
00:26:28,583 --> 00:26:29,958
He must be on his way.

375
00:26:34,458 --> 00:26:37,375
Captain. Could you please delay the ship just for five minutes?

376
00:26:37,458 --> 00:26:38,213
I am expecting a friend.

377
00:26:38,239 --> 00:26:39,150
He will be here any minute.

378
00:26:39,208 --> 00:26:40,904
Just five minutes, Captain. Please.

379
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:41,608
- I am sorry.

380
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:43,146
I could not delay the ship.

381
00:26:43,172 --> 00:26:44,816
The ship has to sail on time.

382
00:26:51,708 --> 00:26:53,453
There's no chance of him coming now.

383
00:26:53,479 --> 00:26:54,108
- No chance.

384
00:26:54,166 --> 00:26:55,583
I've lost my 10,000, too!

385
00:26:55,666 --> 00:26:58,250
Stupid! You're more concerned about your money!

386
00:27:03,333 --> 00:27:04,616
Stupid. Idiot.

387
00:27:04,642 --> 00:27:06,566
He missed the ship!

388
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:09,500
All my planning has gone down the drain!

389
00:27:09,583 --> 00:27:14,000
Now, what will I do alone on this stupid ship?!

390
00:27:14,083 --> 00:27:16,250
Why did he do this!

391
00:27:16,833 --> 00:27:19,166
Why did he do this!

392
00:27:30,458 --> 00:27:34,375
Rohit is here! Rohit is here!

393
00:27:38,166 --> 00:27:39,666
Rohit is here!

394
00:28:01,041 --> 00:28:02,291
Idiot.

395
00:28:51,541 --> 00:28:55,416
"In a love boat.."

396
00:28:59,125 --> 00:29:01,416
"In a love boat .."

397
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:04,041
"..amongst high tides.."

398
00:29:04,125 --> 00:29:06,583
"..along the roar of the winds .."

399
00:29:06,666 --> 00:29:09,125
"..together we went.."

400
00:29:09,208 --> 00:29:12,791
"..far off in the sky."

401
00:29:19,333 --> 00:29:21,750
"In a love boat.."

402
00:29:21,833 --> 00:29:24,250
"..amongst high tides.."

403
00:29:24,333 --> 00:29:26,791
"..along the roar of the winds.."

404
00:29:26,875 --> 00:29:29,250
"..together we went.."

405
00:29:29,333 --> 00:29:32,791
"..far off in the sky."

406
00:29:34,375 --> 00:29:39,416
"Far off in the sky."

407
00:30:04,875 --> 00:30:10,125
"Will we find love there, will flowers bloom?"

408
00:30:12,333 --> 00:30:17,375
"Will we find love there, will flowers bloom?"

409
00:30:17,458 --> 00:30:22,666
"The one my heart is looking for, will I find that lover?"

410
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:32,666
"There dreams will come true, everyone will be dear to you."

411
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:38,000
"The heart's wish will be fulfilled, you will get your lover."

412
00:30:43,583 --> 00:30:44,078
"I heard.." "

413
00:30:44,104 --> 00:30:44,941
- What did you hear?"

414
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:45,588
" What you said" "

415
00:30:45,614 --> 00:30:46,233
- What did I say?"

416
00:30:46,291 --> 00:30:47,958
"We have to go far off."

417
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,791
"In the boat of love.. amongst high tides.."

418
00:30:52,875 --> 00:30:55,500
".. along the roar of the winds .."

419
00:30:55,583 --> 00:30:57,916
".. together we went .."

420
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,333
".. far off in the sky."

421
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,625
" Far off in the sky."

422
00:31:46,125 --> 00:31:51,291
"If I get your love, may I never lose it."

423
00:31:56,250 --> 00:32:01,041
"If I get your love, may I never lose it."

424
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:06,500
"If we get together, may we never part."

425
00:32:11,416 --> 00:32:16,416
"Where everyone is in love, how can we lose our love."

426
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:21,708
"Where all are lovers, how can we part?"

427
00:32:27,291 --> 00:32:28,172
"Then come, let's go." "

428
00:32:28,198 --> 00:32:28,858
- Yes, let's go."

429
00:32:28,916 --> 00:32:29,979
"Together, like this." "

430
00:32:30,005 --> 00:32:30,713
- Yes, together.

431
00:32:30,739 --> 00:32:31,800
Drowned in happiness!"

432
00:32:31,833 --> 00:32:34,166
"In a love boat .."

433
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:36,791
".. amongst high tides.."

434
00:32:41,833 --> 00:32:44,291
"In a love boat .."

435
00:32:44,375 --> 00:32:46,916
"..amongst high tides.."

436
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,291
"..along the roar of the winds .."

437
00:32:49,375 --> 00:32:51,875
".. together we went .."

438
00:32:51,958 --> 00:32:55,333
"..far off in the sky"

439
00:33:05,875 --> 00:33:10,875
"Oh God!"

440
00:33:10,958 --> 00:33:15,875
"Oh God!"

441
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,833
"Oh God! - Oh God!"

442
00:33:19,916 --> 00:33:22,416
"Oh God! - Oh God!"

443
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,018
"Oh God!

444
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:28,191
-Oh God!"

445
00:33:38,875 --> 00:33:41,958
Thank you. Oh.

446
00:33:42,375 --> 00:33:43,500
See you!

447
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,291
Where were you?
I was so afraid.

448
00:33:49,625 --> 00:33:50,846
How did you get late?

449
00:33:50,872 --> 00:33:52,150
Why did you get late?

450
00:33:52,208 --> 00:33:55,666
Late? I had reached here three hours earlier.
- What!

451
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,333
Actually, I was unable to sleep the whole night.
- Me, too.

452
00:33:59,416 --> 00:34:00,851
It's the first time, isn't it?

453
00:34:00,877 --> 00:34:02,358
- What happens the first time?

454
00:34:02,916 --> 00:34:05,916
There's restlessness and a feeling of joy as well.

455
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,208
You are voicing my feelings.

456
00:34:08,416 --> 00:34:09,091
You, too?

457
00:34:09,117 --> 00:34:11,066
- I just cannot tell you.

458
00:34:11,333 --> 00:34:12,875
Sometimes I feel that..

459
00:34:12,958 --> 00:34:16,625
.. all the stars in the sky have fallen on my lap.

460
00:34:17,041 --> 00:34:18,291
And sometimes I feel that..

461
00:34:18,375 --> 00:34:21,250
Come on. Come on, Rohit. One photograph.

462
00:34:21,333 --> 00:34:22,253
What are you doing!

463
00:34:22,279 --> 00:34:23,150
Stop it! Stop it!

464
00:34:23,208 --> 00:34:24,425
Leave him alone.

465
00:34:24,451 --> 00:34:25,338
Enough now.

466
00:34:25,364 --> 00:34:26,733
Go from here. Go!

467
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,125
Rohit, let's pose.

468
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:31,438
- Am I looking fine?

469
00:34:31,464 --> 00:34:32,900
- Ready, girls. Smile.

470
00:34:33,166 --> 00:34:34,666
One more. One more.

471
00:34:35,791 --> 00:34:38,083
Nice. - One minute.

472
00:34:40,416 --> 00:34:40,943
Ready.

473
00:34:40,969 --> 00:34:42,900
- What are you doing?

474
00:34:43,041 --> 00:34:44,416
Put up your hands.

475
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:47,543
Wow! That's a lovely Titanic pose.

476
00:34:47,569 --> 00:34:48,608
- Wow, Titanic!

477
00:34:50,083 --> 00:34:51,130
Stop it. Enough now.

478
00:34:51,156 --> 00:34:52,150
- What's going on!

479
00:34:53,416 --> 00:34:56,583
Oh, no. - How mean, friend. Miss J.

480
00:35:00,666 --> 00:35:04,000
There's nobody here. So where were we?

481
00:35:04,541 --> 00:35:06,458
I think you were talking about the stars.

482
00:35:06,916 --> 00:35:10,375
Forget about me, tell me what you were thinking about.

483
00:35:10,958 --> 00:35:11,848
What do I say?

484
00:35:11,874 --> 00:35:14,733
I never thought my dream would be realised.

485
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,875
What! Has your dream been realised?

486
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,666
Not fully, but at least, it has begun.

487
00:35:21,083 --> 00:35:22,500
Even I feel a little..

488
00:35:23,041 --> 00:35:25,375
But you must have gone on a cruise so many times.
- Cruise?

489
00:35:25,833 --> 00:35:27,750
And seen many a ships, too.
- Ship?

490
00:35:27,958 --> 00:35:29,958
Were you talking about cruise and ship until now?

491
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,666
Yes. What did you think?

492
00:35:32,875 --> 00:35:37,583
I thought.. well, you.. you.. me..

493
00:35:37,958 --> 00:35:39,047
Hi! Hi handsome.

494
00:35:39,073 --> 00:35:40,025
- Hi. - Come.

495
00:35:40,083 --> 00:35:40,876
Come with me.

496
00:35:40,902 --> 00:35:41,816
- What's this!

497
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:45,125
You've got me totally smitten!

498
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:46,768
What a voice you have!

499
00:35:46,794 --> 00:35:47,483
- Thanks!

500
00:35:48,125 --> 00:35:50,583
You are present in every breath I take!

501
00:35:51,041 --> 00:35:52,833
Etch your name on my heart.

502
00:35:52,916 --> 00:35:55,708
What!
- I mean here.

503
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,791
Pen. - Sure.

504
00:36:02,375 --> 00:36:06,250
I knew this scene was inevitable but I didn't know it'd happen so soon!

505
00:36:06,791 --> 00:36:11,041
Just look at the way he's writing his name on her heart!

506
00:36:11,125 --> 00:36:13,125
Not her heart, he's writing it on her hand!

507
00:36:13,208 --> 00:36:16,458
Yes!
The matter begins with the hand only!

508
00:36:19,625 --> 00:36:20,931
Oh! How sweet!

509
00:36:20,957 --> 00:36:21,983
Thank you.

510
00:36:30,833 --> 00:36:33,208
Excuse me. Hey, Sonia!

511
00:36:33,416 --> 00:36:34,875
Go to hell.

512
00:36:35,958 --> 00:36:37,375
Listen to me!

513
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,875
What a silly girl!

514
00:36:40,125 --> 00:36:40,725
Let's go.

515
00:36:40,751 --> 00:36:43,150
My parents are waiting for you over tea.

516
00:36:43,375 --> 00:36:45,750
What! - Let's go. Please!

517
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:54,291
"My young, pudgy brother, I am in the land of dreams here."

518
00:36:54,708 --> 00:36:57,458
"Let alone the ship, the entire city seems to be running over water!"

519
00:36:58,041 --> 00:36:59,833
"I miss you terribly."

520
00:37:00,416 --> 00:37:02,250
"If I ever become successful,..

521
00:37:02,333 --> 00:37:04,916
.. I'll surely take aunt, uncle and you on a cruise."

522
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:06,222
"Hey, guess what!

523
00:37:06,248 --> 00:37:08,650
Do you remember the girl at the signal?"

524
00:37:08,916 --> 00:37:10,333
"She's also on this ship."

525
00:37:10,416 --> 00:37:13,916
"Her name is Sonia but all her friends here call her Miss J!"

526
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,291
"She is so irritable and gets angry at the drop of a pin!"

527
00:37:18,666 --> 00:37:20,000
Who does he think he is!

528
00:37:20,083 --> 00:37:21,625
He isn't the only boy in this world!

529
00:37:21,791 --> 00:37:23,336
He flirts in front of me!

530
00:37:23,362 --> 00:37:25,400
I'll show him what flirting is!

531
00:37:25,458 --> 00:37:26,791
He doesn't know me!

532
00:37:29,333 --> 00:37:30,140
It must be him!

533
00:37:30,166 --> 00:37:31,941
He must have come to apologise!

534
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,155
I am sorry.

535
00:37:33,181 --> 00:37:34,441
I am sorry.

536
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:40,250
You! - Why?
Were you expecting somebody else?

537
00:37:40,583 --> 00:37:43,625
When you're around, can I expect anybody else?

538
00:37:43,791 --> 00:37:46,375
You have made my evening by coming here!

539
00:37:46,583 --> 00:37:48,916
You are sounding quite different!

540
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,142
Just watch!

541
00:37:50,168 --> 00:37:54,733
If I don't drive you crazy, then I'll change my name!

542
00:37:56,375 --> 00:37:58,139
Aren't you ready yet?

543
00:37:58,165 --> 00:38:01,691
Will you wear this and go for the party?

544
00:38:01,916 --> 00:38:04,666
Hey, get up! Hurry!

545
00:38:05,625 --> 00:38:07,833
Will you wear this coat to the party?

546
00:38:07,916 --> 00:38:10,708
Why not? This is my best Sunday coat.

547
00:38:10,791 --> 00:38:12,208
I bought it from the flea market.

548
00:38:12,291 --> 00:38:14,416
I wear this even to the church.

549
00:38:14,666 --> 00:38:16,225
It won't do here.

550
00:38:16,251 --> 00:38:17,900
- Then what will?

551
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:22,750
Read this.
The dress code is a DJ.

552
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,723
DJ? - A dinner jacket - which

553
00:38:24,749 --> 00:38:26,233
means a bow and a suit.

554
00:38:26,416 --> 00:38:27,708
Do we have that?

555
00:38:28,041 --> 00:38:29,500
We don't.

556
00:38:29,958 --> 00:38:33,625
Does that mean, we cannot go for the Christmas party?

557
00:38:34,333 --> 00:38:37,041
Sit. Both of us will celebrate Christmas.

558
00:38:42,833 --> 00:38:43,958
Idea!

559
00:38:44,458 --> 00:38:46,916
Laundry, sir. Laundry, sir.

560
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:47,561
Laundry, sir.

561
00:38:47,587 --> 00:38:49,400
Free pressing, sir.
Christmas time, sir.

562
00:38:49,458 --> 00:38:50,791
Laundry, sir.

563
00:38:51,291 --> 00:38:53,291
Yes? - Laundry boy sir.

564
00:38:53,375 --> 00:38:54,547
Merry christmas, sir.

565
00:38:54,573 --> 00:38:55,329
Free ironing.

566
00:38:55,355 --> 00:38:56,191
Free pressing.

567
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:58,000
Free ironing? Excellent.

568
00:38:58,041 --> 00:38:59,583
Shirt, sir. - Shirt?

569
00:38:59,666 --> 00:39:02,250
Yes. Take this.

570
00:39:02,333 --> 00:39:04,088
Pantaloon, sir. Pants.

571
00:39:04,114 --> 00:39:06,108
- Pants. Come back soon.

572
00:39:06,166 --> 00:39:07,500
See the moon.

573
00:39:07,583 --> 00:39:08,490
See the moon?

574
00:39:08,516 --> 00:39:10,400
But there isn't any moon?

575
00:39:10,458 --> 00:39:12,416
Yes, sir. Somewhere in the sky.

576
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,644
You keep watching it.

577
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:15,358
I wish you a merry Christmas.

578
00:39:15,416 --> 00:39:17,264
I wish me a merry..

579
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:18,650
Laundry, sir.

580
00:39:19,375 --> 00:39:21,000
Yes. - Laundry, brother.

581
00:39:23,416 --> 00:39:25,666
Wow! Look who's here!

582
00:39:28,583 --> 00:39:31,708
My God! He is so handsome.

583
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:34,750
Me, too.

584
00:39:40,291 --> 00:39:42,000
Hi! - Wow.

585
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,083
Wow!

586
00:39:45,875 --> 00:39:48,750
A special gift for someone so special.

587
00:39:49,041 --> 00:39:50,416
For me? - Yes.

588
00:39:50,958 --> 00:39:51,633
Thank you.

589
00:39:51,659 --> 00:39:52,400
- Welcome.

590
00:39:55,166 --> 00:39:56,583
Excuse me. - Yes.

591
00:40:01,541 --> 00:40:04,041
This rose is for you on my behalf.

592
00:40:04,541 --> 00:40:07,000
This rose is for you on my behalf.

593
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:11,500
One does not give someone a gift presented by somebody else.

594
00:40:11,583 --> 00:40:13,375
Exactly!

595
00:40:13,458 --> 00:40:16,958
One does not give someone a gift presented by somebody else!

596
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,416
But Sonia, what will I do with this rose?

597
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:23,000
It looks so beautiful in your hand.

598
00:40:23,041 --> 00:40:26,000
But you know.. you know that I am..

599
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,083
.. allergic to roses!

600
00:40:29,166 --> 00:40:32,791
Hello. Hello.

601
00:40:32,875 --> 00:40:35,791
Ladies and gentlemen, your attention please.

602
00:40:36,041 --> 00:40:41,125
The two magicians who were to present the magic show here..

603
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:43,166
..they have been delayed somehow.

604
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:48,083
Please bear with us as the magicians will be here any moment.

605
00:40:48,416 --> 00:40:50,746
Laundry, boy. Laundry, boy.

606
00:40:50,772 --> 00:40:52,066
- Laundry boy!

607
00:40:53,333 --> 00:40:56,500
This is for you. - Me?

608
00:40:56,666 --> 00:41:00,083
This rose has travelled the hall and come here!

609
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:02,207
It's befitting only on you.

610
00:41:02,233 --> 00:41:03,441
Please take it.

611
00:41:03,666 --> 00:41:04,407
Thank you.

612
00:41:04,433 --> 00:41:07,025
But how did you find out my name?

613
00:41:08,041 --> 00:41:10,250
This is called the magic of love!

614
00:41:10,916 --> 00:41:12,541
Fire brigade!

615
00:41:13,583 --> 00:41:16,021
Oh my God! Pigeon! Pigeon!

616
00:41:16,047 --> 00:41:17,733
- Pigeon. Pigeon.

617
00:41:20,083 --> 00:41:21,666
Pigeon. Pigeon. Pigeon.

618
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:24,666
Oh no! Oh no!

619
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,291
Take this. - Yes, thanks.

620
00:41:31,208 --> 00:41:32,375
Wow!

621
00:41:37,916 --> 00:41:39,375
Wow!

622
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,916
Wow!

623
00:41:50,416 --> 00:41:52,041
Wow!

624
00:41:57,833 --> 00:41:59,000
Thank you.

625
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:02,920
What's happening!

626
00:42:02,946 --> 00:42:04,483
Where did you get these clothes from?

627
00:42:05,125 --> 00:42:06,961
I think it belongs to the magicians.

628
00:42:06,987 --> 00:42:08,108
They were to perform.

629
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:09,458
Magic?

630
00:42:10,166 --> 00:42:11,583
Wow!

631
00:42:11,833 --> 00:42:13,166
Wow!

632
00:42:14,541 --> 00:42:15,014
How cute!

633
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,382
- One more magic, please.

634
00:42:16,408 --> 00:42:17,775
- One more magic, please.

635
00:42:18,416 --> 00:42:20,708
Wow! - How sweet.

636
00:42:20,916 --> 00:42:23,250
That's great. Thank you.

637
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:25,666
Merry Christmas!

638
00:42:32,125 --> 00:42:33,583
Merry Christmas!

639
00:42:33,708 --> 00:42:36,291
Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas!

640
00:42:46,916 --> 00:42:48,166
Merry Christmas, Sonia.

641
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,208
Wow! - Merry Christmas.

642
00:42:54,916 --> 00:42:56,666
Mr. Atul, Merry Christmas.

643
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:57,958
Merry Christmas!

644
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:00,919
What happened?

645
00:43:00,945 --> 00:43:02,191
Won't you wish me?

646
00:43:02,583 --> 00:43:04,673
Your face has become a poster!

647
00:43:04,699 --> 00:43:06,858
There's no space left to wish!

648
00:43:06,916 --> 00:43:09,458
Okay, Tony. Relax. Merry Christmas.

649
00:43:09,833 --> 00:43:11,250
Cheers!

650
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,291
Sonia!

651
00:43:29,708 --> 00:43:30,916
Sonia!

652
00:43:35,291 --> 00:43:37,750
He tries to act too smart!

653
00:43:39,208 --> 00:43:42,166
His face is fully covered with lipstick marks!

654
00:43:42,625 --> 00:43:44,875
And he wants me to wish him!

655
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,666
Who does he think he is!

656
00:43:47,692 --> 00:43:48,316
- Sonia!

657
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:49,503
What are you doing there?

658
00:43:49,529 --> 00:43:51,108
- Why are you shouting from there?

659
00:43:51,166 --> 00:43:53,625
If you're a man, come here and talk!

660
00:43:58,541 --> 00:44:00,041
What are you doing?

661
00:44:00,375 --> 00:44:02,657
Can't you see at night?!

662
00:44:02,683 --> 00:44:04,108
I'm drinking!

663
00:44:04,916 --> 00:44:06,083
What's the occasion?

664
00:44:06,875 --> 00:44:09,583
Why are you bothered if I drink in joy or in sorrow?

665
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:12,416
Go and flirt with those stupid girls!

666
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:16,291
But what can I do if girls run after me?

667
00:44:16,375 --> 00:44:19,208
Indeed! Girls are after you!

668
00:44:19,291 --> 00:44:20,687
Have you seen your face?

669
00:44:20,713 --> 00:44:22,108
You look like a baboon!

670
00:44:22,166 --> 00:44:24,000
What did you say! One minute!

671
00:44:25,583 --> 00:44:27,226
And what were you doing?!

672
00:44:27,252 --> 00:44:29,025
Openly flirting with Atul!

673
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:31,625
Why? Were you offended?

674
00:44:31,708 --> 00:44:33,833
Why should I feel offended?

675
00:44:33,859 --> 00:44:35,275
Do as you please!

676
00:44:35,416 --> 00:44:36,666
What are you doing?!

677
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:39,092
Can't you see at night?!

678
00:44:39,118 --> 00:44:40,191
I'm drinking!

679
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:44,791
Hey! If you finish my bottle, then I will finish you off!

680
00:44:46,208 --> 00:44:48,416
Finished! - You!

681
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:12,291
What's wrong? Oh, no!

682
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,750
Wow!

683
00:45:24,958 --> 00:45:25,888
It is gorgeous.

684
00:45:25,914 --> 00:45:27,525
- Ship? Where's the ship?

685
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:29,919
Can't you see in the day either?!

686
00:45:29,945 --> 00:45:30,733
It's gone!

687
00:45:30,791 --> 00:45:35,083
Gone?
It left us behind! - Yes.

688
00:45:35,166 --> 00:45:36,322
You are responsible for all this!

689
00:45:36,348 --> 00:45:37,608
If you were not to drink at night..

690
00:45:37,666 --> 00:45:40,041
..you wouldn't have been tipsy nor would you have sat on this boat!

691
00:45:40,125 --> 00:45:42,166
Mister! You're forgetting one thing!

692
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:44,666
If you were not to flirt, I wouldn't have drank!

693
00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:46,083
Neither would I have been tipsy..

694
00:45:46,166 --> 00:45:48,000
..nor would I have come here on this boat!

695
00:45:48,041 --> 00:45:51,958
I think you're still high! You talk nonsense!

696
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:54,208
You don't know the trouble we are in!

697
00:45:54,291 --> 00:45:56,916
Trouble? Where is trouble?

698
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,583
Blue, blue skies above, gusty breeze!

699
00:46:00,666 --> 00:46:02,708
Water on all sides!

700
00:46:02,791 --> 00:46:06,000
Indeed! When you feel thirsty, drink this saline water!

701
00:46:06,041 --> 00:46:08,458
When you feel hungry, eat the gusty breeze!

702
00:46:08,541 --> 00:46:11,833
And when you feel cold at night, wrap the blue, blue skies!

703
00:46:12,083 --> 00:46:13,113
Why are you shouting?

704
00:46:13,139 --> 00:46:15,150
If people hear you, what will they say?

705
00:46:15,208 --> 00:46:17,375
That you are crazy!

706
00:46:17,833 --> 00:46:19,155
And anyway, who will hear us?!

707
00:46:19,181 --> 00:46:20,150
There's nobody here!

708
00:46:20,208 --> 00:46:22,208
You speak, and I'll listen.

709
00:46:22,291 --> 00:46:25,666
Just shut up, and let me think what to do!

710
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,095
Shall I tell you what to do?

711
00:46:28,121 --> 00:46:30,066
Let's play hide-and-seek.

712
00:46:30,333 --> 00:46:32,958
Shut up!

713
00:46:42,791 --> 00:46:44,208
Did you find out anything?
- No.

714
00:46:44,750 --> 00:46:45,438
Excuse me, Captain.

715
00:46:45,464 --> 00:46:46,150
We need your help.

716
00:46:46,458 --> 00:46:48,458
Rohit and Sonia are not to be found on the ship.
- What?

717
00:46:48,541 --> 00:46:50,833
Yes. - Have you searched the whole ship?

718
00:46:53,583 --> 00:46:56,583
Wow! How beautiful!

719
00:46:57,541 --> 00:46:59,740
For how long will I keep rowing?

720
00:46:59,766 --> 00:47:01,483
I don't sight any place!

721
00:47:06,458 --> 00:47:09,291
Island! Look, there's an island over there!

722
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:19,500
Superb! Wow!

723
00:47:19,583 --> 00:47:20,875
What a shore!

724
00:47:20,958 --> 00:47:22,625
It appears that on every shore..

725
00:47:22,708 --> 00:47:24,416
..is written the names of the people who will be here!

726
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:26,289
Bravo! Go on!

727
00:47:26,315 --> 00:47:27,691
Heave ho!

728
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:28,354
Heave ho!

729
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:30,191
- Hey madam, don't scream!

730
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:32,583
One swat, and you'll stop doing that!

731
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:34,375
Swat? My, my!

732
00:47:34,401 --> 00:47:37,275
What a romantic word!

733
00:47:37,416 --> 00:47:39,041
I've heard it for the first time.

734
00:47:39,125 --> 00:47:41,208
Where did you learn that word from?

735
00:47:41,291 --> 00:47:43,500
Damn! Romance in every thing!

736
00:47:43,791 --> 00:47:45,047
What are you looking at?

737
00:47:45,073 --> 00:47:46,066
Get down and push!

738
00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:50,750
She keeps rattling like a parrot!

739
00:47:51,291 --> 00:47:52,750
Come on, push!

740
00:48:15,125 --> 00:48:16,333
She's gone crazy!

741
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,583
Is somebody here?!

742
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,833
Hey, wait!

743
00:48:42,083 --> 00:48:45,375
Wow! Superb!

744
00:48:45,541 --> 00:48:46,573
This is so lovely!

745
00:48:46,599 --> 00:48:47,400
Right, Rohit?

746
00:48:47,458 --> 00:48:51,541
Just like Adam and Eve, both of us are together in this Eden,..

747
00:48:51,666 --> 00:48:53,916
.. much before the world came into existence.

748
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:55,875
Remove your skirt.

749
00:48:56,166 --> 00:48:58,041
What! Skirt?

750
00:48:58,458 --> 00:49:00,125
Have you taken me so seriously?!

751
00:49:00,208 --> 00:49:02,583
We are not the actual Adam and Eve!

752
00:49:02,666 --> 00:49:04,000
Heed me, and remove your skirt!

753
00:49:04,083 --> 00:49:05,958
What! Are you crazy?!

754
00:49:06,125 --> 00:49:08,000
You are trying to take advantage of a beautiful..

755
00:49:08,083 --> 00:49:09,583
..lone girl in a desolate place?

756
00:49:09,791 --> 00:49:11,500
Heartless, shameless!

757
00:49:12,291 --> 00:49:13,822
That's it! I don't know any more words!

758
00:49:13,848 --> 00:49:15,025
- You won't heed me this way!

759
00:49:15,625 --> 00:49:18,125
No! Don't touch me!

760
00:49:18,208 --> 00:49:20,166
Rohit! Leave me!

761
00:49:21,416 --> 00:49:22,958
Rohit, what are you doing?!

762
00:49:23,666 --> 00:49:25,000
Leave me!

763
00:49:27,083 --> 00:49:28,458
What have you done?!

764
00:49:28,625 --> 00:49:30,375
You! I will kill you.

765
00:49:30,401 --> 00:49:31,150
- Sorry.

766
00:49:31,208 --> 00:49:32,833
What do you mean by sorry?

767
00:49:33,625 --> 00:49:36,916
Swine! You idiot! I will kill you.

768
00:49:59,166 --> 00:50:00,458
What are you doing?

769
00:50:00,666 --> 00:50:02,416
Can't you see I'm hoisting a flag?

770
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,500
A flag? But why?

771
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:08,416
If they come to search for us, they may sight this flag.

772
00:50:08,583 --> 00:50:10,916
And they'll know that we are somewhere nearby.

773
00:50:11,125 --> 00:50:13,916
Maybe, we'll be saved. Understood?

774
00:50:14,041 --> 00:50:16,916
But I don't want them to come and disturb us.

775
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,629
I don't want to go back.

776
00:50:18,655 --> 00:50:19,400
- Meaning?

777
00:50:19,458 --> 00:50:22,000
I'm happy here.. extremely happy!

778
00:50:22,083 --> 00:50:25,500
Look there! Our tree house will be built atop that hill!

779
00:50:25,583 --> 00:50:27,041
We'll stay there!

780
00:50:27,875 --> 00:50:32,000
You will leave for work in the morning, and I will wait for you.

781
00:50:32,208 --> 00:50:35,916
And at dusk, when you return tired after cutting the logs..

782
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
.. I will look at you and smile.

783
00:50:38,041 --> 00:50:41,000
You will light the firewood, and I'll keep watching you.

784
00:50:41,083 --> 00:50:42,666
Then you will cook, and I..

785
00:50:42,750 --> 00:50:44,791
Will you do anything or not?!

786
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:45,963
I will. - What?

787
00:50:45,989 --> 00:50:47,400
- Eat from your hand!

788
00:50:47,541 --> 00:50:50,708
Yes. Then I will sing you a lullaby and put you to sleep.

789
00:50:51,375 --> 00:50:55,250
I'll wake you at dawn by singing 'Raag Bhairavi'.

790
00:50:55,750 --> 00:50:57,375
And when you still won't wake up,..

791
00:50:57,458 --> 00:50:59,458
.. then I'll give you two slaps!

792
00:50:59,541 --> 00:51:02,333
Slaps? How mean! Why will you slap me?

793
00:51:02,416 --> 00:51:04,625
A person needs to be slapped to snap him out of his dreams!

794
00:51:07,583 --> 00:51:09,458
Hey! Where are you going?

795
00:51:09,875 --> 00:51:11,636
To fetch a hamburger from McDonald!

796
00:51:11,662 --> 00:51:12,566
Will you eat one?

797
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:15,708
Yes. But get me a vegetarian one.

798
00:51:48,541 --> 00:51:50,708
Hey, helicopter! Oh, no!

799
00:51:59,708 --> 00:52:01,083
Where's the flag?

800
00:52:07,333 --> 00:52:09,416
Hey, Sonia! What are you doing?!

801
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:11,833
Catching fishes for dinner.

802
00:52:12,333 --> 00:52:14,666
With that flag?! - Yes.

803
00:52:16,041 --> 00:52:17,801
I had put up the flag as a signal!

804
00:52:17,827 --> 00:52:19,483
The search party came and left!

805
00:52:19,541 --> 00:52:20,749
Foolish girl!

806
00:52:20,775 --> 00:52:23,191
- You called me foolish?!

807
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:26,041
Yes, I did! You are a foolish, crazy, haughty girl!

808
00:52:26,125 --> 00:52:27,583
You push me! Huh?

809
00:52:27,708 --> 00:52:29,476
Push you? I'll kill you!

810
00:52:29,502 --> 00:52:30,900
- You'll kill me?!

811
00:52:34,833 --> 00:52:36,083
Help!

812
00:52:37,125 --> 00:52:39,791
Rohit, I can't swim. Rohit!

813
00:52:39,875 --> 00:52:41,300
How do I save you?

814
00:52:41,326 --> 00:52:42,408
I can't swim!

815
00:52:42,434 --> 00:52:43,066
- Help.

816
00:52:54,541 --> 00:52:55,708
Here!

817
00:53:03,125 --> 00:53:04,375
Help!

818
00:53:04,708 --> 00:53:07,458
He's actually drowning! Rohit!

819
00:53:27,708 --> 00:53:33,250
Rohit. Rohit. Rohit. Oh my God!

820
00:53:40,791 --> 00:53:43,500
Rohit! Rohit!

821
00:53:44,541 --> 00:53:48,416
Rohit. Rohit.

822
00:53:51,416 --> 00:53:55,502
Rohit! You're all right, aren't you?

823
00:53:55,528 --> 00:53:56,775
Thank God.

824
00:53:57,041 --> 00:53:58,958
Stupid. Idiot. Fool!

825
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,083
When you can't swim, why did you dive into the water?

826
00:54:01,166 --> 00:54:02,461
I was just kidding!

827
00:54:02,487 --> 00:54:04,941
Why did you risk your life for me?

828
00:54:06,875 --> 00:54:10,000
Why? Answer me.

829
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,708
Because I love you.

830
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,166
What!

831
00:54:14,833 --> 00:54:16,478
What did you say?

832
00:54:16,504 --> 00:54:17,858
Say it again!

833
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,291
Why? Did I say something wrong?

834
00:54:20,416 --> 00:54:22,791
Repeat what you said!

835
00:54:22,958 --> 00:54:24,750
I love you.

836
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,833
Say it again. - What?

837
00:54:27,083 --> 00:54:28,128
Say you love me.

838
00:54:28,154 --> 00:54:29,525
- I said I love you.

839
00:54:30,416 --> 00:54:34,625
That's it! Just keep saying it, again and again!

840
00:55:05,875 --> 00:55:09,000
I love you.

841
00:55:17,708 --> 00:55:25,902
"My heart is eager to hear all the time.

842
00:55:25,928 --> 00:55:29,525
Say you love me.."

843
00:55:29,583 --> 00:55:33,000
".. say you love me."

844
00:55:33,041 --> 00:55:36,500
"Yes, I love you."

845
00:55:36,583 --> 00:55:40,333
"Yes, I love you."

846
00:55:42,416 --> 00:55:50,625
"In your sweet talks there is an impulsive consent."

847
00:55:50,708 --> 00:55:54,208
"Say you love me."

848
00:55:54,291 --> 00:55:57,708
"Say you love me."

849
00:55:57,791 --> 00:56:01,208
"Yes, I love you."

850
00:56:01,291 --> 00:56:05,958
"Yes, I love you."

851
00:56:48,166 --> 00:56:55,666
"If love wasn't there in this world then tell me what would there be."

852
00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:09,333
"If love wasn't there in this world then tell me what would there be."

853
00:57:09,416 --> 00:57:15,875
"There would not be any heart beating then."

854
00:57:15,958 --> 00:57:17,687
"My heart beats for you.

855
00:57:17,713 --> 00:57:19,441
Oh darling, come to me.

856
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:24,041
"This is my confession of love to you."

857
00:57:24,125 --> 00:57:27,666
"Say you love me."

858
00:57:27,750 --> 00:57:31,083
"Say you love me."

859
00:57:31,166 --> 00:57:34,708
"Yes, I love you."

860
00:57:34,791 --> 00:57:39,458
"Yes, I love you."

861
00:58:09,208 --> 00:58:13,208
"Two lovers, ones crazy in love.

862
00:58:13,234 --> 00:58:16,608
What do they do, tell me!"

863
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:27,130
"Two lovers, ones crazy in love.

864
00:58:27,156 --> 00:58:30,358
What do they do, tell me!"

865
00:58:30,416 --> 00:58:36,958
"Why ask me, ask your heart!"

866
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:45,250
"I know what you are waiting for."

867
00:58:45,333 --> 00:58:48,791
"Say you love me."

868
00:58:48,875 --> 00:58:52,291
"Say you love me."

869
00:58:52,375 --> 00:58:55,916
"Yes, I love you."

870
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:00,291
"Yes, I love you."

871
00:59:32,083 --> 00:59:39,625
"If we hadn't met, what would have happened, tell me."

872
00:59:46,208 --> 00:59:53,250
"If we hadn't met, what would have happened, tell me."

873
00:59:53,333 --> 01:00:00,000
"To tell you the truth then my dream wouldn't have come true!"

874
01:00:00,041 --> 01:00:08,208
"My heart says our union is the memorable forever."

875
01:00:08,291 --> 01:00:11,750
"Say you love me."

876
01:00:11,833 --> 01:00:15,208
"Say you love me."

877
01:00:15,291 --> 01:00:18,708
"Yes, I love you."

878
01:00:18,791 --> 01:00:23,541
"Yes, I love you."

899
01:00:38,166 --> 01:00:39,958
Already counting the stars, are you?

900
01:00:42,291 --> 01:00:44,000
I'm looking for a face in them.

901
01:00:45,583 --> 01:00:46,750
Whose?

902
01:00:48,333 --> 01:00:49,458
My mother's.

903
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,291
I don't understand.

904
01:00:54,208 --> 01:00:55,666
Mother used to say that..

905
01:00:56,791 --> 01:00:59,291
..when someone close dies..

906
01:01:00,666 --> 01:01:02,291
..then he turns into a star.

907
01:01:05,125 --> 01:01:07,541
Even I lost my mother in childhood.

908
01:01:07,625 --> 01:01:08,532
Will she also..

909
01:01:08,558 --> 01:01:10,733
- She must have also become a star.

910
01:01:11,708 --> 01:01:15,416
And today, these stars have brought light into our lives.

911
01:01:16,916 --> 01:01:18,375
Then, make me a promise.

912
01:01:19,916 --> 01:01:23,166
That this light will burn bright in our hearts forever.

913
01:01:24,208 --> 01:01:25,500
I promise.

914
01:01:26,791 --> 01:01:30,041
Like these stars, forever!

915
01:02:16,875 --> 01:02:19,541
I love you!

916
01:02:35,083 --> 01:02:36,291
What are you doing?

917
01:02:36,375 --> 01:02:38,083
Hoisting a flag. - Why?

918
01:02:38,166 --> 01:02:39,916
So that I can return to the city..

919
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:46,083
..and tell the whole world that I love you.

920
01:02:54,041 --> 01:02:55,166
What's wrong?

921
01:02:56,958 --> 01:02:58,561
Today, I don't want to go back.

922
01:02:58,587 --> 01:02:59,775
- What are you saying!

923
01:03:00,250 --> 01:03:01,375
Yes, Sonia.

924
01:03:02,416 --> 01:03:08,250
Because in that city and world, there are many barriers between us.

925
01:03:08,333 --> 01:03:09,862
Where are the barriers?

926
01:03:09,888 --> 01:03:11,150
I don't sight any.

927
01:03:11,708 --> 01:03:13,208
Tell me now, is there any barrier?

928
01:03:32,083 --> 01:03:35,000
Daddy! Daddy!

929
01:03:55,125 --> 01:03:59,041
Malik, sack Rohit right away!

930
01:03:59,250 --> 01:04:01,291
Don't worry, Saxena.

931
01:04:01,375 --> 01:04:04,000
I have already decided to do that.

932
01:04:04,083 --> 01:04:07,166
And I will also try and see that he doesn't get a job anywhere else.

933
01:04:07,250 --> 01:04:08,416
Good!

934
01:04:08,583 --> 01:04:10,416
Let him roam in the streets!

935
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:16,333
Daddy, I have never seen this side of you.

936
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:20,516
Daddy, I cannot tell you how nice Rohit is!

937
01:04:20,542 --> 01:04:22,275
You don't know him.

938
01:04:22,458 --> 01:04:25,083
Your hatred for him prevents you from knowing him better!

939
01:04:25,166 --> 01:04:27,166
There is no need for me to know him!

940
01:04:28,041 --> 01:04:31,500
I know you, and I know myself!

941
01:04:34,541 --> 01:04:40,041
I have decided that you will go to New Zealand, to my brother.

942
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:42,375
To complete your studies.

943
01:04:43,416 --> 01:04:46,916
I have made all the arrangements. Okay?

944
01:04:47,791 --> 01:04:48,958
Good.

945
01:05:36,916 --> 01:05:39,041
Sonia, here's your passport and ticket.

946
01:05:39,125 --> 01:05:41,083
I have spoken to brother.

947
01:05:41,166 --> 01:05:43,083
They'll come to receive you at the airport.

948
01:05:47,458 --> 01:05:49,500
I know that you are feeling miserable now.

949
01:05:50,208 --> 01:05:53,791
But try and understand that we are poles apart.

950
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:01,666
Rohit!

951
01:06:06,416 --> 01:06:07,541
Do you see the difference?!

952
01:06:08,458 --> 01:06:13,458
You are in a luxurious car, and he rides a godforsaken cycle!

953
01:06:14,458 --> 01:06:17,375
Look! He is on land, and you are..

954
01:06:21,875 --> 01:06:23,750
There's no difference now, right?

955
01:06:37,208 --> 01:06:40,541
Great! He took away Sonia right before your eyes..

956
01:06:40,625 --> 01:06:42,048
.. and you just kept watching!

957
01:06:42,074 --> 01:06:43,733
You didn't even try and stop him!

958
01:06:43,875 --> 01:06:45,564
Malik, I had no time to think!

959
01:06:45,590 --> 01:06:46,941
I thought my daughter..

960
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,201
Anyway, it's still not too late.

961
01:06:49,227 --> 01:06:51,358
Inform the police immediately.

962
01:06:51,416 --> 01:06:53,916
Or they'll get married and come here to seek your blessing.

963
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,375
You are wrong, sir.

964
01:06:57,583 --> 01:06:59,208
We sure have come back.

965
01:07:00,833 --> 01:07:02,458
But we didn't get married.

966
01:07:04,583 --> 01:07:07,666
Eloping and marrying would be belittling our love, sir.

967
01:07:09,208 --> 01:07:14,375
I love Sonia, and I respect my love.

968
01:07:16,125 --> 01:07:21,041
I will marry her only when I start earning.

969
01:07:21,416 --> 01:07:26,041
And I guess you need my help for that?

970
01:07:26,333 --> 01:07:29,833
No, sir. I don't need your help.

971
01:07:30,708 --> 01:07:33,500
I have confidence and faith in myself.

972
01:07:33,625 --> 01:07:39,416
Rohit, I am very impressed with your talks and feelings.

973
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,666
I am really, really impressed.

974
01:07:42,125 --> 01:07:45,041
I promise, if you succeed in your purpose..

975
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:49,041
..then I'll willingly give away my daughter's hand in marriage to you.

976
01:07:49,125 --> 01:07:50,291
Daddy.

977
01:07:51,875 --> 01:07:52,719
Oh, Daddy!

978
01:07:52,745 --> 01:07:55,108
You are a sweetheart, Dad.

979
01:07:55,166 --> 01:07:56,033
I love you.

980
01:07:56,059 --> 01:07:59,525
- Before leaving, I would like to tell you something.

981
01:08:00,916 --> 01:08:04,458
Do not consider me coming here, a weakness.

982
01:08:05,833 --> 01:08:09,166
I entrust Sonia to you as a possession.

983
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:16,500
I will be honest, and so will you.

984
01:08:16,875 --> 01:08:20,291
I promise that I will definitely be honest.

985
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,877
Anyway, honesty is my profession.

986
01:08:23,903 --> 01:08:24,958
Am I right, Malik?

987
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,166
Indeed!

988
01:08:28,416 --> 01:08:29,583
Bye, Sonia.

989
01:08:31,875 --> 01:08:34,000
Rohit, what you did was absolutely correct!

990
01:08:34,791 --> 01:08:36,366
And I'll help you.

991
01:08:36,392 --> 01:08:37,441
- But how?!

992
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:40,708
He has his voice, and we'll take it to the people.

993
01:08:40,833 --> 01:08:42,958
Will he stand at Churchgate station and sing?!

994
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,916
No. But he can at least stand on the stage and sing.

995
01:08:46,166 --> 01:08:49,208
Idea. We'll record his voice in a cassette..

996
01:08:49,291 --> 01:08:51,000
.. and distribute it in all the colleges!

997
01:08:51,083 --> 01:08:51,965
And discos too!

998
01:08:51,991 --> 01:08:54,108
- And near traffic signals as well!

999
01:08:54,166 --> 01:08:56,333
When his voice gets popular, we'll have a stage show.

1000
01:08:56,416 --> 01:08:59,000
Fantastic!
And I'll organise the show!

1001
01:09:26,125 --> 01:09:27,666
This is called a stroke!

1002
01:09:27,958 --> 01:09:30,875
Well, Rohit is the one hitting strokes!

1003
01:09:31,416 --> 01:09:34,125
Go anywhere in the town, and it's Rohit!

1004
01:09:34,208 --> 01:09:36,916
I think he will succeed in achieving his goal!

1005
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,708
And you will be forced to fulfil your promise!

1006
01:09:42,750 --> 01:09:47,000
Malik, I made the promise, after giving it much thought.

1007
01:09:47,833 --> 01:09:51,708
We will decide his success and goal.

1008
01:09:52,416 --> 01:09:53,916
And his goal is still very distant.

1009
01:09:57,666 --> 01:09:59,458
Hello! - This is Shinde speaking.

1010
01:10:00,250 --> 01:10:02,541
I just met Commissioner Verma.

1011
01:10:03,083 --> 01:10:05,000
He's been enquiring a lot about you.

1012
01:10:05,708 --> 01:10:08,333
I fear he may take some action against you.

1013
01:10:10,125 --> 01:10:11,392
Don't worry.

1014
01:10:11,418 --> 01:10:16,483
Before he can do that, fix a meeting between us.

1015
01:10:16,541 --> 01:10:22,375
1. 2. 3. 4. 5. - Look, who is there! Sonia.

1016
01:10:23,333 --> 01:10:24,666
Hi!

1017
01:10:27,083 --> 01:10:28,333
Sonia.

1018
01:10:35,208 --> 01:10:36,416
Rohit.

1019
01:10:36,750 --> 01:10:39,625
Sonia, why have you come here?

1020
01:10:40,416 --> 01:10:42,272
I'm meeting you after so many days.

1021
01:10:42,298 --> 01:10:43,941
Please don't ask no questions.

1022
01:10:44,250 --> 01:10:46,583
Just let me feel the experience of being with you.

1023
01:10:47,125 --> 01:10:51,458
Rohit, I cannot live without you for even a moment now.

1024
01:10:52,458 --> 01:10:56,875
When you are not with me, nothing seems good.

1025
01:10:57,958 --> 01:11:01,250
And, do you think I can live without you?

1026
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,375
I am doing all this only to be with you.

1027
01:11:05,458 --> 01:11:08,791
I don't know why I am feeling scared today.

1028
01:11:09,666 --> 01:11:10,916
Aren't you feeling the same?

1029
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,166
I used to feel scared.

1030
01:11:15,541 --> 01:11:16,791
Whenever I'd wonder..

1031
01:11:16,875 --> 01:11:18,916
..whether I'd be able to sing before people or not..

1032
01:11:19,625 --> 01:11:21,000
..I used to feel really scared.

1033
01:11:23,416 --> 01:11:25,875
But you've filled my heart with so much love today..

1034
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,041
.. that there's probably no place for fear.

1035
01:11:30,458 --> 01:11:32,250
I am not at all scared today.

1036
01:11:34,166 --> 01:11:36,041
Sonia, we will be victorious.

1037
01:11:37,625 --> 01:11:39,375
There is no need for us to feel scared.

1038
01:11:41,791 --> 01:11:43,416
Because you are with me.

1039
01:11:44,625 --> 01:11:45,875
And I'm with you.

1040
01:11:48,125 --> 01:11:51,708
And with us, are the stars.

1041
01:11:51,916 --> 01:11:54,833
And us as well!

1042
01:11:54,916 --> 01:11:58,750
Luck is also with us! All the tickets for the show are sold!

1043
01:11:58,833 --> 01:12:00,666
The show is house-full.

1044
01:12:03,208 --> 01:12:06,041
Oh, I forgot something! What's the time?

1045
01:12:06,208 --> 01:12:07,333
5 o'clock.

1046
01:12:07,416 --> 01:12:08,513
I had to pick up Amit.

1047
01:12:08,539 --> 01:12:09,958
Do you have your motorbike?

1048
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,291
Yes. - May I borrow it?

1049
01:12:11,750 --> 01:12:12,916
Here. - Thanks.

1050
01:12:14,041 --> 01:12:15,327
I'll be back in a jiffy.

1051
01:12:15,353 --> 01:12:16,263
- Come back soon.

1052
01:12:16,289 --> 01:12:17,466
I will wait for you.

1053
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:19,125
Come on, dear. Let's get ready for the show.

1054
01:12:41,250 --> 01:12:42,833
Welcome, Mr. Commissioner.

1055
01:12:46,041 --> 01:12:51,083
I'm grateful to you for making time to meet me.

1056
01:12:51,166 --> 01:12:53,333
Even I wanted to meet you..

1057
01:12:53,416 --> 01:12:55,916
.. but not at such an unsuitable place.

1058
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,750
This is indeed quite an unsuitable place.

1059
01:12:58,291 --> 01:13:01,875
But secrets are let out only at such places.

1060
01:13:01,958 --> 01:13:04,791
Your secrets are no more a secret.

1061
01:13:05,166 --> 01:13:08,791
Because I very well know that..

1062
01:13:08,875 --> 01:13:12,166
.. most of the drugs disposed off from my department..

1063
01:13:12,250 --> 01:13:14,583
.. to be set ablaze reach you instead!

1064
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,583
So why don't you arrest me?

1065
01:13:17,666 --> 01:13:20,250
I have come here to do that only, Mr. Malik.

1066
01:13:20,500 --> 01:13:22,708
But if you become the State witness and reveal the names..

1067
01:13:23,083 --> 01:13:27,416
..of the men from my department who supply drugs to you..

1068
01:13:27,708 --> 01:13:30,041
.. then I can have your sentence reduced.

1069
01:13:30,291 --> 01:13:32,333
You are indeed talking for my well-being.

1070
01:13:32,583 --> 01:13:37,500
But if I reveal the names before these officers, will it be safe?

1071
01:13:37,583 --> 01:13:41,416
Of course! Both of them are reliable!

1072
01:14:17,750 --> 01:14:18,916
Rohit!

1073
01:15:15,416 --> 01:15:18,458
Sirjee, Rohit has witnessed it all!

1074
01:15:23,791 --> 01:15:24,958
Kill him.

1075
01:15:30,875 --> 01:15:32,833
Drive faster. Faster.

1076
01:15:44,416 --> 01:15:45,541
Faster.

1077
01:17:04,875 --> 01:17:10,166
Rohit! Rohit! Rohit! Rohit!

1078
01:17:10,250 --> 01:17:13,000
Everybody is here but there's no sign of Rohit!

1079
01:17:13,041 --> 01:17:14,583
Rohit! Rohit!

1080
01:17:14,666 --> 01:17:18,583
Sonia! Sonia! Rohit is.. - Yes?

1081
01:17:18,666 --> 01:17:19,530
What's wrong?

1082
01:17:19,556 --> 01:17:21,816
- Rohit has met with an accident!

1083
01:17:21,875 --> 01:17:23,041
Accident!

1084
01:17:24,666 --> 01:17:26,500
No!

1085
01:17:37,250 --> 01:17:38,416
Rohit!

1086
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:41,208
Rohit! Rohit!

1087
01:17:41,583 --> 01:17:42,905
Please wait! - Where's Rohit?!

1088
01:17:42,931 --> 01:17:43,900
- You can't go ahead.

1089
01:17:43,958 --> 01:17:45,692
Where is my Rohit?!

1090
01:17:45,718 --> 01:17:47,816
What happened to him?!

1091
01:17:57,958 --> 01:17:59,730
He fell in the water?!

1092
01:17:59,756 --> 01:18:01,608
But Rohit cannot swim!

1093
01:18:01,666 --> 01:18:05,105
Atul, Rohit cannot swim!

1094
01:18:05,131 --> 01:18:07,566
Please save him!

1095
01:18:07,625 --> 01:18:08,910
Sonia. Sonia.

1096
01:18:08,936 --> 01:18:11,900
- Save Rohit! He cannot swim!

1097
01:18:29,208 --> 01:18:30,875
Sir, we didn't find the body.

1098
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:32,958
Rohit!

1099
01:18:45,875 --> 01:18:48,666
Amit! My child!

1100
01:18:50,625 --> 01:18:52,750
Doctor, why doesn't he say anything?

1101
01:18:53,625 --> 01:18:55,333
What does he blankly stare at?

1102
01:18:57,500 --> 01:19:01,541
Rodriquez.
What has happened to our children?

1103
01:19:02,458 --> 01:19:04,125
Why did God do this?!

1104
01:19:05,458 --> 01:19:07,166
Why?!

1105
01:19:08,666 --> 01:19:10,916
Why did God do this?

1106
01:19:13,750 --> 01:19:17,958
"My heart says .."

1107
01:19:20,208 --> 01:19:24,833
".. our union .."

1108
01:19:26,750 --> 01:19:34,791
".. is memorable forever."

1109
01:19:36,250 --> 01:19:41,625
"Say I love you."

1110
01:19:42,333 --> 01:19:48,250
"Say I love you."

1111
01:19:52,166 --> 01:19:55,541
Saxena, I have some very good news for you.

1112
01:19:55,625 --> 01:19:57,916
Kadam and Shinde have had closed the commissioner's case..

1113
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:59,208
.. saying that he was killed in an encounter.

1114
01:19:59,291 --> 01:20:01,125
There! We've won this case, too!

1115
01:20:02,416 --> 01:20:09,000
Malik, this victory has devastated a father.

1116
01:20:10,208 --> 01:20:11,500
It's been a month now.

1117
01:20:12,500 --> 01:20:14,916
Sonia has become lifeless, grieving for Rohit.

1118
01:20:16,125 --> 01:20:18,208
As if life has severed ties with her.

1119
01:20:18,291 --> 01:20:22,666
My friend! Time heals all wounds!

1120
01:20:22,875 --> 01:20:25,625
Change her surroundings. Send her somewhere far away.

1121
01:20:27,708 --> 01:20:29,208
You may be right.

1122
01:20:30,458 --> 01:20:33,166
I'll send her to my brother.

1123
01:21:05,666 --> 01:21:06,333
Sonia!

1124
01:21:06,359 --> 01:21:08,001
- Why are you shouting?

1125
01:21:08,027 --> 01:21:09,000
Cool it, Mom.

1126
01:21:09,041 --> 01:21:09,736
Sonia! Sonia!

1127
01:21:09,762 --> 01:21:11,018
Daddy, where is Sonia?

1128
01:21:11,044 --> 01:21:12,525
- She must be in her room.

1129
01:21:12,583 --> 01:21:13,204
She isn't!

1130
01:21:13,230 --> 01:21:15,650
That's why I'm asking you! - Careful!

1131
01:21:15,708 --> 01:21:16,461
Don't worry, Dad.

1132
01:21:16,487 --> 01:21:17,858
I'm destined to keep falling!

1133
01:21:17,916 --> 01:21:19,212
Sonia! Sonia!

1134
01:21:19,238 --> 01:21:20,733
Where are you?

1135
01:21:25,833 --> 01:21:27,208
She has gone mad.

1136
01:21:33,916 --> 01:21:35,688
Sonia, why are you standing here?

1137
01:21:35,714 --> 01:21:36,733
We have to go out!

1138
01:21:36,791 --> 01:21:38,541
Come on! We'll get late.

1139
01:21:38,791 --> 01:21:40,493
I'm not in the mood, Neeta.

1140
01:21:40,519 --> 01:21:41,400
You carry on.

1141
01:21:41,458 --> 01:21:42,166
Oh God!

1142
01:21:42,192 --> 01:21:45,025
What do you mean by you're not in the mood?

1143
01:21:45,166 --> 01:21:48,125
Do you know, Sonia you've been here for 2 weeks..

1144
01:21:48,208 --> 01:21:50,041
.. and you've not stepped out of the house even once!

1145
01:21:50,125 --> 01:21:51,833
I don't care. We are going out.

1146
01:21:52,083 --> 01:21:55,250
And for God's sake get out of that 'Salwar' (Indian dress).

1147
01:22:15,250 --> 01:22:17,500
Hey! By the time this signal turns to green..

1148
01:22:17,583 --> 01:22:20,625
.. I'll call mother and inform her that we'll be late.

1149
01:22:53,958 --> 01:22:55,083
Rohit?

1150
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:15,041
All right. I am going.

1151
01:23:16,125 --> 01:23:19,708
I told mother that we'll return by two o'clock.

1152
01:23:23,750 --> 01:23:24,656
Come on, baby.

1153
01:23:24,682 --> 01:23:26,233
Time to rock and roll.

1154
01:23:27,125 --> 01:23:28,500
What's wrong, Sonia?

1155
01:23:29,291 --> 01:23:30,501
I'm not feeling too well.

1156
01:23:30,527 --> 01:23:32,316
If you want to go, please carry on.

1157
01:23:32,375 --> 01:23:33,329
You're too much!

1158
01:23:33,355 --> 01:23:35,441
This is New Zealand's best disco!

1159
01:23:35,500 --> 01:23:37,833
If you listen to the music, you'll be perfectly fine!

1160
01:23:37,916 --> 01:23:39,041
Come on. Let's go, man.

1161
01:24:33,958 --> 01:24:38,291
"Life lasts a moment, then you have to leave."

1162
01:24:38,375 --> 01:24:43,375
"What gift can you take along.."

1163
01:24:51,708 --> 01:24:56,000
"Life lasts a moment, then you have to leave."

1164
01:24:56,083 --> 01:25:00,500
"What gift can you take along.."

1165
01:25:00,583 --> 01:25:04,875
"We came empty handed, we will go empty handed."

1166
01:25:04,958 --> 01:25:08,750
"Only words of love will be immortal."

1167
01:25:08,833 --> 01:25:13,541
"Then smile and make everyone smile too."

1168
01:25:13,625 --> 01:25:18,000
"Oh my heart you sing along.."

1169
01:25:22,333 --> 01:25:26,916
"Oh my heart you sing along.."

1170
01:26:15,541 --> 01:26:24,625
"I dream of my love.."

1171
01:26:26,666 --> 01:26:35,833
"I have someone in the world."

1172
01:26:37,208 --> 01:26:41,750
"A special face, close to your heart."

1173
01:26:41,833 --> 01:26:46,083
"I desire her, I hope to meet her."

1174
01:26:46,166 --> 01:26:51,000
"But there is no place you can find your mate."

1175
01:26:51,041 --> 01:26:55,625
"Oh my heart you sing along.."

1176
01:26:59,916 --> 01:27:04,375
"Oh my heart you sing along.."

1177
01:27:48,666 --> 01:27:57,666
"Life is a breeze of happiness."

1178
01:27:59,750 --> 01:28:08,958
"And this breeze is an illusion."

1179
01:28:10,375 --> 01:28:14,791
"What happiness is this that you don't get.."

1180
01:28:14,875 --> 01:28:19,208
"Happiness you get, but you still feel deprived."

1181
01:28:19,291 --> 01:28:24,041
"But friends, don't worry, come what may."

1182
01:28:24,125 --> 01:28:28,583
"Oh my heart you sing along.."

1183
01:28:32,916 --> 01:28:37,458
"Oh my heart you sing along.."

1184
01:29:13,541 --> 01:29:16,166
Hi! So we meet again.

1185
01:29:17,708 --> 01:29:18,833
Who are you?

1186
01:29:19,833 --> 01:29:25,000
They call me Raj Chopra.

1187
01:29:26,375 --> 01:29:27,583
This is a strange coincidence.

1188
01:29:27,666 --> 01:29:30,500
I mean, if I'm not mistaken, then this is our second meeting.

1189
01:29:30,916 --> 01:29:34,166
But I haven't seen you around. You are not from here. Are you?

1190
01:29:34,250 --> 01:29:36,625
Naturally, Raj. She is my cousin

1191
01:29:36,708 --> 01:29:40,208
Sonia Saxena and has come from India.

1192
01:29:40,291 --> 01:29:42,375
She will be staying with us for some days.

1193
01:29:42,458 --> 01:29:43,583
Fantastic.

1194
01:29:43,666 --> 01:29:45,875
If seems as if the Taj Mahal itself has come here!

1195
01:29:45,958 --> 01:29:47,416
India must have become prosperous.

1196
01:29:47,500 --> 01:29:50,291
Idiot! Not prosperous but empty!

1197
01:29:50,375 --> 01:29:52,291
I mean, it must've become desolate.

1198
01:29:52,375 --> 01:29:54,625
Sonia, don't mind what he says.

1199
01:29:54,708 --> 01:29:57,583
He's got a passion for speaking in Urdu!

1200
01:29:57,666 --> 01:30:00,625
You won't believe it, he's been trying to learn Urdu since a child.

1201
01:30:00,708 --> 01:30:02,583
But he has still not succeeded!

1202
01:30:03,208 --> 01:30:03,675
Hi, Nita.

1203
01:30:03,701 --> 01:30:05,566
- Hi. I will catch you guys in a moment. Okay?

1204
01:30:06,208 --> 01:30:09,583
Anyways, it was nice to meet you.

1205
01:30:59,583 --> 01:31:01,333
Raj, have you had your breakfast?

1206
01:31:01,416 --> 01:31:03,416
Yes, Mom. Done that.

1207
01:32:20,166 --> 01:32:22,375
David! Who is it?

1208
01:32:22,458 --> 01:32:24,442
Madam, a very cute young girl.

1209
01:32:24,468 --> 01:32:25,525
Asking for Raj.

1210
01:32:25,708 --> 01:32:28,291
Hello, Aunty! - Hello.

1211
01:32:28,541 --> 01:32:30,350
I am Sonia, Neeta's cousin.

1212
01:32:30,376 --> 01:32:31,983
I have come from India.

1213
01:32:32,375 --> 01:32:34,125
I wanted to meet Raj.

1214
01:32:34,208 --> 01:32:35,890
He has just left to go skiing.

1215
01:32:35,916 --> 01:32:37,316
Please come in, my dear.

1216
01:32:37,375 --> 01:32:38,720
Why are you standing there?

1217
01:32:38,746 --> 01:32:39,691
- Thank you, Aunt.

1218
01:32:40,125 --> 01:32:41,291
Please.

1219
01:32:51,541 --> 01:32:53,112
What a beautiful house!

1220
01:32:53,138 --> 01:32:54,025
- Thank you.

1221
01:32:55,708 --> 01:32:59,000
For how long have you been staying here?

1222
01:32:59,416 --> 01:33:01,916
We left India around 25-26 years ago.

1223
01:33:02,166 --> 01:33:05,750
We came here after marriage, and settled here.

1224
01:33:07,250 --> 01:33:09,625
Didn't any of you ever go back to India?

1225
01:33:09,708 --> 01:33:11,000
We never got a chance.

1226
01:33:11,458 --> 01:33:13,708
Raj was born a year after we got married.

1227
01:33:14,166 --> 01:33:16,750
Raising him, his school and college..

1228
01:33:16,833 --> 01:33:18,368
..my husband's business.

1229
01:33:18,394 --> 01:33:19,608
Time just went by.

1230
01:33:19,666 --> 01:33:23,125
And Raj? Didn't he ever go to India?

1231
01:33:23,416 --> 01:33:25,875
No, my dear. Raj has never been to India.

1232
01:33:26,125 --> 01:33:28,166
And anyway, whom will he go to?

1233
01:33:28,375 --> 01:33:30,000
We don't have anybody there.

1234
01:34:07,416 --> 01:34:09,583
Hey! Raj!

1235
01:34:11,291 --> 01:34:12,239
Hey! Nita.

1236
01:34:12,265 --> 01:34:14,066
- Hi! How are you?

1237
01:34:14,541 --> 01:34:15,321
Here I go again.

1238
01:34:15,347 --> 01:34:16,419
- Gosh.
What happened?

1239
01:34:16,445 --> 01:34:17,175
Are you okay?

1240
01:34:17,458 --> 01:34:20,083
Nothing. As usual.

1241
01:34:20,208 --> 01:34:22,708
When I was born, the priest had said..

1242
01:34:22,791 --> 01:34:25,250
"Neeta is, where injury is!"

1243
01:34:25,458 --> 01:34:28,458
But why is she absent in your presence?

1244
01:34:28,541 --> 01:34:29,708
Who?

1245
01:34:30,166 --> 01:34:32,458
Oh. Sonia!

1246
01:34:32,541 --> 01:34:35,500
She disappeared in the morning itself that's why I'm quiet.

1247
01:34:35,791 --> 01:34:38,833
But why are you so pensive?

1248
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:40,714
Because of your cousin Sonia.

1249
01:34:40,740 --> 01:34:42,275
- Why? What has she done?

1250
01:34:42,333 --> 01:34:44,083
Ask what she's not done!

1251
01:34:44,166 --> 01:34:48,083
She doesn't let me sleep at night, eat, ski or drive!

1252
01:34:48,208 --> 01:34:50,000
Wherever I look, I see her!

1253
01:34:50,125 --> 01:34:51,222
That's funny.

1254
01:34:51,248 --> 01:34:53,525
But you've only seen her.

1255
01:34:53,583 --> 01:34:54,958
I know. That's what I am saying.

1256
01:34:55,541 --> 01:34:57,000
I'm unable to fathom a thing.

1257
01:34:58,416 --> 01:35:00,000
One look from her has worked wonders!

1258
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:06,333
Neeta, I just can't tell you the way she was looking at me!

1259
01:35:08,125 --> 01:35:12,583
I just cannot forget those eyes that held so many questions.

1260
01:35:14,500 --> 01:35:16,375
There were so many things apparent on her face.

1261
01:35:17,500 --> 01:35:18,605
So simple.

1262
01:35:18,631 --> 01:35:20,066
So innocent.

1263
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:23,666
And then, the way she just walked away.

1264
01:35:24,208 --> 01:35:26,208
I mean it left so many questions unanswered, you know.

1265
01:35:26,375 --> 01:35:29,666
Too much. Wow! Raj.

1266
01:35:29,750 --> 01:35:31,291
That is so romantic.

1267
01:35:31,375 --> 01:35:35,833
If you were to say the same to Sonia, she'd have fallen unconscious!

1268
01:35:35,916 --> 01:35:37,849
Nita. You've got to help me.

1269
01:35:37,875 --> 01:35:40,566
I want to meet her, get to know her..

1270
01:35:40,625 --> 01:35:41,958
I want to tell her something, I want to hear something!

1271
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:43,500
All right. All right.

1272
01:35:43,583 --> 01:35:46,625
If this is the case, then I will have to help you.

1273
01:35:46,791 --> 01:35:49,492
At the waterfront this evening.
All right?

1274
01:35:49,518 --> 01:35:51,025
- All right, then. Done.

1275
01:35:51,291 --> 01:35:54,083
What! A girl from India had come to meet Raj?

1276
01:35:54,166 --> 01:35:56,333
And her questions seemed like..

1277
01:35:56,416 --> 01:35:58,375
.. she wanted to decide something about Raj.

1278
01:35:58,458 --> 01:36:00,708
Amazing! Raj has never mentioned her!

1279
01:36:01,291 --> 01:36:02,611
There he comes.

1280
01:36:02,637 --> 01:36:04,483
Welcome, gentleman!

1281
01:36:04,958 --> 01:36:07,000
Hi, Dad. Hi, Mom.

1282
01:36:07,250 --> 01:36:08,772
What are you hiding from us?

1283
01:36:08,798 --> 01:36:09,775
Who is that girl?

1284
01:36:09,833 --> 01:36:12,250
Girl? Which girl?

1285
01:36:12,333 --> 01:36:13,281
Stop pretending!

1286
01:36:13,307 --> 01:36:15,025
Sonia had come to meet you.

1287
01:36:16,166 --> 01:36:17,583
Sonia! - Yes.

1288
01:36:18,166 --> 01:36:20,500
You mean Nita's cousin, Sonia.
- Yes!

1289
01:36:20,708 --> 01:36:22,333
The one who's come from India?
- Yes!

1290
01:36:22,750 --> 01:36:24,001
She was here!

1291
01:36:24,027 --> 01:36:25,566
- Yes, she was!

1292
01:36:25,625 --> 01:36:28,291
Well. Mom, she.. she came here..

1293
01:36:28,583 --> 01:36:30,875
It appears that the flame burns bright on both the sides!

1294
01:36:31,041 --> 01:36:32,541
Dad. Dad. Relax, Dad.

1295
01:36:32,625 --> 01:36:35,083
There's no flame! All right.

1296
01:36:35,333 --> 01:36:36,996
It seemed so from her talks.

1297
01:36:37,022 --> 01:36:38,150
What do you think?

1298
01:36:38,291 --> 01:36:39,458
Of course.

1299
01:36:41,875 --> 01:36:43,250
What did it seem like, from her talks?

1300
01:36:43,791 --> 01:36:45,583
You're caught!

1301
01:36:49,166 --> 01:36:50,333
Dad..

1302
01:36:50,625 --> 01:36:56,416
Do you think she must be also feeling the same way that I do?

1303
01:36:56,750 --> 01:36:59,541
Yes.
This is what love is.

1304
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:03,791
Is this love?!
- Yes.

1305
01:37:05,416 --> 01:37:06,957
I don't believe it.

1306
01:37:06,983 --> 01:37:08,441
Ma, is this love?

1307
01:37:09,333 --> 01:37:10,916
Really, Dad? - Yes.

1308
01:37:11,625 --> 01:37:12,750
Finally.

1309
01:37:12,916 --> 01:37:14,000
Okay. Bye.

1310
01:37:14,083 --> 01:37:16,288
Hey! Where are you going?

1311
01:37:16,314 --> 01:37:19,400
- Don't ask me, Dad! I am in love.

1312
01:38:07,541 --> 01:38:10,916
"Why does the wind blow?"

1313
01:38:12,666 --> 01:38:15,875
"Why do the clouds sway?"

1314
01:38:17,708 --> 01:38:22,708
"Why does the heart throb?"

1315
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:26,125
"Neither do you know nor do I."

1316
01:38:28,041 --> 01:38:31,583
"Neither do you know nor do I."

1317
01:38:35,875 --> 01:38:39,541
"Why do flowers blossom?"

1318
01:38:40,958 --> 01:38:44,208
"Why do we crave?"

1319
01:38:46,041 --> 01:38:51,125
"Why does one fall in love?"

1320
01:38:51,208 --> 01:38:54,166
"Neither do you know nor do I."

1321
01:38:56,291 --> 01:39:00,583
"Neither do you know nor do I."

1322
01:39:41,250 --> 01:39:46,291
"This solitaire, this loneliness.."

1323
01:39:46,375 --> 01:39:52,125
"..who's shadow does it adhere in it's threshold?"

1324
01:39:56,625 --> 01:40:01,750
"This wet weather is conducive to love."

1325
01:40:01,833 --> 01:40:07,500
"I know not where love will lead me to."

1326
01:40:08,208 --> 01:40:11,333
"Why is every path lost?"

1327
01:40:13,416 --> 01:40:16,500
"Why does one get engrossed?"

1328
01:40:18,458 --> 01:40:23,416
"Why does one enjoy?"

1329
01:40:23,666 --> 01:40:26,791
"Neither do you know nor do I."

1330
01:40:28,750 --> 01:40:32,791
"Neither do you know nor do I."

1331
01:41:11,083 --> 01:41:16,166
"My heart beats and craves as well."

1332
01:41:16,250 --> 01:41:21,916
"Why does it go astray then?"

1333
01:41:26,541 --> 01:41:31,625
"It's fragrant and glowing, too."

1334
01:41:31,708 --> 01:41:37,416
"But does this heart even understand loyalty?"

1335
01:41:38,083 --> 01:41:41,041
"Why do eyes meet?"

1336
01:41:43,125 --> 01:41:46,166
"Why does it invoke love?"

1337
01:41:48,208 --> 01:41:53,250
"Why does it cast a magic spell?"

1338
01:41:53,583 --> 01:41:56,833
"Neither do you know nor do I."

1339
01:41:58,625 --> 01:42:02,125
"Why do flowers blossom?"

1340
01:42:03,791 --> 01:42:07,500
"Why do we crave?"

1341
01:42:08,875 --> 01:42:13,958
"Why does one fall in love?"

1342
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:17,291
"Neither do you know nor do I."

1343
01:42:19,041 --> 01:42:22,875
"Neither do you know nor do I."

1344
01:43:07,666 --> 01:43:09,916
Come on, Sonia. Change your mood.

1345
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
For how long will you remain dejected?

1346
01:43:12,541 --> 01:43:15,000
I'd say, you have to face things bravely.

1347
01:43:15,333 --> 01:43:16,625
You'll have to live for at least..

1348
01:43:16,708 --> 01:43:20,000
.. the ones who love you if not for yourself.

1349
01:43:20,541 --> 01:43:23,625
Then watch how amazing life is!

1350
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:27,208
And who knows, when and how a miracle takes place!

1351
01:43:29,041 --> 01:43:30,958
A miracle has already taken place, Neeta.

1352
01:43:31,583 --> 01:43:33,250
That's why I'm scared.

1353
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:37,375
You don't know the game that fate is playing with me.

1354
01:43:38,541 --> 01:43:41,250
I hadn't even got over grieving for Rohit.

1355
01:43:41,791 --> 01:43:43,000
And in front of me was..

1356
01:43:52,958 --> 01:43:54,291
Hi, Raj.

1357
01:43:54,375 --> 01:43:55,426
Hi, Nita. How are you?

1358
01:43:55,452 --> 01:43:56,358
- What a surprise!

1359
01:43:56,416 --> 01:43:57,398
What are you doing here?

1360
01:43:57,424 --> 01:43:58,650
- This is called coincidence.

1361
01:43:58,833 --> 01:44:00,317
Coincidence number 3.

1362
01:44:00,343 --> 01:44:02,816
This is our third meeting. Right?

1363
01:44:04,666 --> 01:44:05,791
Hi.

1364
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:10,166
Hey!

1365
01:44:12,125 --> 01:44:13,375
What's the matter with her?

1366
01:44:13,458 --> 01:44:15,253
Does my face appear fine?

1367
01:44:15,279 --> 01:44:16,858
- Let me take a look.

1368
01:44:18,375 --> 01:44:19,875
Yes, it's perfectly fine.

1369
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:21,908
Then why does she run seeing me?

1370
01:44:21,934 --> 01:44:23,066
- I'll go and see.

1371
01:44:26,541 --> 01:44:28,583
Sonia! Sonia!

1372
01:44:32,833 --> 01:44:34,500
Sonia, what is the matter with you?

1373
01:44:34,583 --> 01:44:36,708
Why did you run away like a fool?!

1374
01:44:37,833 --> 01:44:40,666
Sonia, Raj is a very nice boy.

1375
01:44:40,750 --> 01:44:41,958
He is my best friend.

1376
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:43,791
He also hails from a good family.

1377
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:48,041
Girls covet him but you're the one he's crazy about.

1378
01:44:48,125 --> 01:44:50,833
Please, Nita.
Don't say such things.

1379
01:44:51,333 --> 01:44:52,625
I don't like it.

1380
01:44:52,708 --> 01:44:54,791
Why don't you like it?

1381
01:44:55,458 --> 01:44:59,416
What's the matter with you, and what are you doing to yourself?

1382
01:45:00,375 --> 01:45:04,000
You will have to forget the past and live in the present.

1383
01:45:04,083 --> 01:45:07,625
But the same Raj does not let me forget my past!

1384
01:45:08,125 --> 01:45:13,666
Whenever I see him, my past stares right into me!

1385
01:45:14,250 --> 01:45:17,375
Raj!
What does Raj have to do with your past?

1386
01:45:17,458 --> 01:45:20,625
He does! He has a lot to do with my past!

1387
01:45:21,166 --> 01:45:23,916
Because Raj looks just like Rohit!

1388
01:45:24,625 --> 01:45:26,625
And whenever I see Raj..

1389
01:45:27,500 --> 01:45:31,000
..I think about my Rohit!

1390
01:45:35,791 --> 01:45:37,117
What did you say?

1391
01:45:37,143 --> 01:45:39,483
Rohit looks like me! Really?

1392
01:45:39,541 --> 01:45:42,416
So even he has two eyes, one nose,
one mouth and two ears, right?

1393
01:45:47,208 --> 01:45:49,250
There's nothing to laugh about, Raj!

1394
01:45:49,333 --> 01:45:51,250
There is nothing to laugh about.

1395
01:45:51,458 --> 01:45:53,666
That's why she runs away when she sees you.

1396
01:45:54,458 --> 01:45:58,291
She says that your face tortures her.

1397
01:45:58,583 --> 01:46:01,958
Yes, right. I see.

1398
01:46:02,416 --> 01:46:04,083
Nope. She is not interested.

1399
01:46:04,166 --> 01:46:05,579
She doesn't want to meet me.

1400
01:46:05,605 --> 01:46:06,816
These are only excuses.

1401
01:46:06,958 --> 01:46:08,708
They are not excuses, Raj.

1402
01:46:08,875 --> 01:46:11,083
I have seen Rohit's pictures for myself.

1403
01:46:11,375 --> 01:46:13,041
It's unbelievable.

1404
01:46:13,583 --> 01:46:17,791
The same eyes, the same nose, the same face.

1405
01:46:17,875 --> 01:46:19,288
What are you saying, Nita?

1406
01:46:19,314 --> 01:46:20,400
That is impossible.

1407
01:46:20,666 --> 01:46:21,986
I'd like to see those pictures.

1408
01:46:22,012 --> 01:46:22,650
Where's Sonia?

1409
01:46:22,708 --> 01:46:24,750
I am here!

1410
01:46:25,500 --> 01:46:27,208
Hey! Where's he gone?

1411
01:46:36,708 --> 01:46:37,754
Stop laughing!

1412
01:46:37,780 --> 01:46:38,900
You scared me!

1413
01:46:38,958 --> 01:46:39,969
You got scared!

1414
01:46:39,995 --> 01:46:42,691
Suppose I were to look this way, then?

1415
01:46:42,750 --> 01:46:44,875
Then I'd have looked at you in the same manner!

1416
01:46:44,958 --> 01:46:47,000
And suppose I looked this way?

1417
01:46:47,041 --> 01:46:49,541
Then I'd have looked at you in the same fashion!

1418
01:46:49,833 --> 01:46:52,458
And suppose this is how I were to look, then?

1419
01:46:52,916 --> 01:46:54,875
Then this is how I'd have looked at you!

1420
01:46:54,958 --> 01:46:56,243
You can barely see your nose!

1421
01:46:56,269 --> 01:46:57,775
How would you have looked at me?

1422
01:46:57,833 --> 01:47:00,541
I don't need eyes to see you.

1423
01:47:00,625 --> 01:47:02,916
I can see you even with my eyes shut.

1424
01:47:03,166 --> 01:47:04,541
Do you love me so much?

1425
01:47:04,791 --> 01:47:08,541
I love you so much that you are all I can see everywhere.

1426
01:47:08,750 --> 01:47:10,458
And how much do you love me?

1427
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,750
I love you so much..

1428
01:47:13,916 --> 01:47:17,208
.. that whenever you'll open your eyes, you'll find me before you.

1429
01:47:17,291 --> 01:47:19,208
You'll see me.

1430
01:47:29,666 --> 01:47:31,541
I would like to see Rohit's pictures.

1431
01:47:34,125 --> 01:47:35,291
That's enough, Sonia!

1432
01:47:36,458 --> 01:47:39,083
I want to see how my face tortures you!

1433
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:41,583
How it reminds you of Rohit!

1434
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:46,125
Come along.

1435
01:47:47,583 --> 01:47:50,291
Look at this! And this too!

1436
01:48:12,541 --> 01:48:14,000
How is it possible!

1437
01:48:15,375 --> 01:48:16,541
My face!

1438
01:48:17,541 --> 01:48:19,250
Unbelievable.

1439
01:48:21,875 --> 01:48:26,083
Even I had thought, how could this be possible?!

1440
01:48:27,708 --> 01:48:29,958
When I saw you for the first time..

1441
01:48:30,125 --> 01:48:32,750
.. I felt that my Rohit had come back.

1442
01:48:33,125 --> 01:48:35,083
That he got saved from getting drowned.

1443
01:48:36,375 --> 01:48:41,000
My happiness knew no bounds thinking that my Rohit had returned!

1444
01:48:42,208 --> 01:48:46,000
But when I realised that you were not my Rohit..

1445
01:48:46,833 --> 01:48:47,958
.. then..

1446
01:48:48,916 --> 01:48:52,666
.. then I lost it again.

1447
01:49:06,958 --> 01:49:08,125
It is a carbon copy.

1448
01:49:09,291 --> 01:49:12,458
I had heard that two faces look alike.

1449
01:49:12,833 --> 01:49:14,541
But such uncanny resemblance!

1450
01:49:14,958 --> 01:49:16,208
I hope it is not a joke.

1451
01:49:18,208 --> 01:49:19,583
It is a joke, Dad.

1452
01:49:21,333 --> 01:49:23,041
That life has played on me.

1453
01:49:25,083 --> 01:49:27,833
I fell in love for the first time, Dad.

1454
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:31,958
And I lost her even before I could win her.

1455
01:49:35,208 --> 01:49:38,666
Because my face reminds her of Rohit!

1456
01:49:42,083 --> 01:49:43,750
She doesn't want to meet me.

1457
01:49:45,583 --> 01:49:47,166
She runs away from me, Dad!

1458
01:49:53,083 --> 01:49:58,791
No lover in this world must have ever faced such a dilemma!

1459
01:49:59,958 --> 01:50:02,083
Where his own face has let him down!

1460
01:50:07,041 --> 01:50:11,375
You tell me, what's my fault?

1461
01:50:13,458 --> 01:50:14,750
What do I do, Dad?

1462
01:50:16,625 --> 01:50:17,833
What do I do?

1463
01:50:20,250 --> 01:50:25,625
As far as I know you, you have never conceded defeat in life.

1464
01:50:27,083 --> 01:50:29,791
You have always got what you've wanted.

1465
01:50:30,791 --> 01:50:32,208
You love her, don't you?

1466
01:50:33,166 --> 01:50:33,864
Yes, Dad.

1467
01:50:33,890 --> 01:50:35,983
- Then don't give up, son.

1468
01:50:37,291 --> 01:50:38,458
Go and get her.

1469
01:50:40,458 --> 01:50:41,708
Come on.

1470
01:50:50,250 --> 01:50:53,791
Nita! Nita!

1471
01:50:55,041 --> 01:50:56,958
Yes, Raj.
- Hi, Aunt.

1472
01:50:57,416 --> 01:50:58,625
Is Neeta at home?

1473
01:50:58,708 --> 01:51:01,916
No. She has gone to see off Sonia at the airport.

1474
01:51:02,708 --> 01:51:03,916
Airport!

1475
01:51:04,208 --> 01:51:05,583
Oh no!

1476
01:51:21,750 --> 01:51:23,053
Any drink, please.

1477
01:51:23,079 --> 01:51:24,525
- Yes. Coke please.

1478
01:51:27,208 --> 01:51:28,333
What about you, sir?

1479
01:51:28,416 --> 01:51:29,763
A coke for me too, please.

1480
01:51:29,789 --> 01:51:30,358
Thank you.

1481
01:51:32,833 --> 01:51:34,208
You! - Hello.

1482
01:51:34,291 --> 01:51:36,041
You have followed me even here?!

1483
01:51:37,500 --> 01:51:38,625
And what's this?

1484
01:51:39,333 --> 01:51:42,375
Well, some people see my face and flee.

1485
01:51:42,583 --> 01:51:45,083
Therefore, I had to take the hint from this moustache.

1486
01:51:46,500 --> 01:51:48,416
I mean, I had to take the help of this moustache.

1487
01:51:48,833 --> 01:51:52,833
However, if this isn't enough, then I have brought a beard, too.

1488
01:51:53,166 --> 01:51:55,085
Stop all this nonsense, Raj.

1489
01:51:55,111 --> 01:51:56,275
Remove all this!

1490
01:51:56,791 --> 01:51:57,402
Okay. Okay.

1491
01:51:57,428 --> 01:51:59,816
If you are offended, then I'll remove it.

1492
01:52:00,166 --> 01:52:03,416
But I was only trying to make you laugh.

1493
01:52:04,375 --> 01:52:07,125
Raj, I totally disapprove of jokes.

1494
01:52:07,416 --> 01:52:09,416
Please. Leave me alone.

1495
01:52:23,041 --> 01:52:25,458
Sonia, I know that you have endured a lot of trauma.

1496
01:52:28,416 --> 01:52:32,583
I may not even be able to gauge what you must have gone through.

1497
01:52:35,833 --> 01:52:37,791
But you forget one thing, Sonia.

1498
01:52:40,375 --> 01:52:43,041
You forget that life is still with you!

1499
01:52:44,083 --> 01:52:45,416
You are alive.

1500
01:52:46,416 --> 01:52:50,083
And there surely is a reason and purpose behind it!

1501
01:52:52,166 --> 01:52:55,083
Which will certainly bring back the smile on your lips.

1502
01:52:57,500 --> 01:53:02,791
I want to lend you a hand in finding that purpose.

1503
01:53:04,875 --> 01:53:06,083
The choice is eventually yours.

1504
01:53:27,666 --> 01:53:28,791
Look. Look.

1505
01:53:31,166 --> 01:53:32,833
Funny.
- Very funny.

1506
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:42,416
Really, very funny.

1507
01:54:00,583 --> 01:54:04,208
Raj, I wanted to tell you something.

1508
01:54:04,291 --> 01:54:07,750
Its okay, Sonia. I know what your answer is.

1509
01:54:08,750 --> 01:54:11,958
Perhaps we were destined to be together only until here.

1510
01:54:13,291 --> 01:54:16,916
I'll spend the night at some hotel and return by tomorrow's flight.

1511
01:54:17,875 --> 01:54:21,166
Anyways, it was nice meeting you.

1512
01:54:28,666 --> 01:54:29,875
Take care.

1513
01:54:32,375 --> 01:54:33,583
Taxi!

1514
01:54:37,750 --> 01:54:38,916
Sonia!

1515
01:54:42,875 --> 01:54:46,375
These are some of your pictures which I had clicked.

1516
01:54:47,625 --> 01:54:49,375
Perhaps I have no right over them now.

1517
01:54:53,250 --> 01:54:54,625
But yes! The memories are mine.

1518
01:54:56,000 --> 01:55:00,000
You take these pictures, I'll take the memories.

1519
01:55:10,333 --> 01:55:11,500
Taxi!

1520
01:55:16,541 --> 01:55:17,833
Driver, stop the taxi!

1521
01:55:20,416 --> 01:55:21,583
Raj!

1522
01:55:21,791 --> 01:55:25,375
Raj! Raj! Are you all right? Raj!

1523
01:55:30,708 --> 01:55:31,916
Come on!

1524
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:33,291
Police. Police.

1525
01:55:41,208 --> 01:55:42,333
Come on! Get up!

1526
01:55:43,541 --> 01:55:44,791
Inspector Kadam.

1527
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,059
Kadam, this is weird!

1528
01:55:47,085 --> 01:55:48,358
I saw Rohit!

1529
01:55:50,583 --> 01:55:53,208
What! Have they found his body?

1530
01:55:53,833 --> 01:55:56,875
Not a dead body but a moving one! He's alive!

1531
01:55:57,083 --> 01:55:58,099
What rubbish!

1532
01:55:58,125 --> 01:56:00,233
Are you out of your mind?

1533
01:56:00,541 --> 01:56:03,958
I know that unless I catch him and bring him before you,..

1534
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:05,375
..none of you are going to believe me!

1535
01:56:05,791 --> 01:56:07,500
Kadam, just do me a favour.

1536
01:56:07,875 --> 01:56:10,000
Deploy our forces outside Rohit and Sonia's homes.

1537
01:56:10,083 --> 01:56:10,850
And yes!

1538
01:56:10,876 --> 01:56:13,941
ap their telephone lines, too.

1539
01:56:15,333 --> 01:56:16,666
Hello. - Daddy!

1540
01:56:16,750 --> 01:56:19,250
Where are you calling from?

1541
01:56:19,833 --> 01:56:21,250
You didn't even inform me about the flight!

1542
01:56:21,333 --> 01:56:23,958
I have reached Mumbai, and I am fine.

1543
01:56:24,083 --> 01:56:25,166
I'm on my way.

1544
01:56:25,250 --> 01:56:28,361
Daddy, someone is trying to kill my friend Raj!

1545
01:56:28,387 --> 01:56:29,941
We need you help, Daddy!

1546
01:56:30,083 --> 01:56:31,375
But where are you now?!

1547
01:56:31,458 --> 01:56:34,256
Near Globe shopping centre, is a telephone booth.

1548
01:56:34,282 --> 01:56:35,400
That's where we are.

1549
01:56:35,458 --> 01:56:37,666
Don't worry, I'll be there soon.

1550
01:56:37,750 --> 01:56:38,916
Okay, Daddy!

1551
01:56:45,666 --> 01:56:46,875
Let me tie.

1552
01:56:57,791 --> 01:56:59,000
Yours is a strange city!

1553
01:57:00,083 --> 01:57:01,500
Anybody gets shot here!

1554
01:57:02,166 --> 01:57:04,291
I had barely landed in India, and this..

1555
01:57:04,458 --> 01:57:09,291
If it hadn't missed my heart,
I'd have taken off again.. straight up!

1556
01:57:31,041 --> 01:57:32,029
There's nobody here.

1557
01:57:32,055 --> 01:57:33,191
Did you hear it right?

1558
01:57:33,333 --> 01:57:35,250
At your behest, I had the phones tapped.

1559
01:57:35,333 --> 01:57:37,541
She had given this address.

1560
01:57:41,541 --> 01:57:45,125
Kadam, they are somewhere around.

1561
01:57:53,625 --> 01:57:55,875
What's happening?!

1562
01:58:05,333 --> 01:58:06,792
I don't understand a thing.

1563
01:58:06,818 --> 01:58:08,816
Some people are trying to kill you.

1564
01:58:08,916 --> 01:58:10,875
The telephones at my place are tapped!

1565
01:58:11,541 --> 01:58:13,375
Even I cannot exactly fathom what's happening.

1566
01:58:14,375 --> 01:58:17,166
Who are they, and why do they want to kill me?

1567
01:58:17,791 --> 01:58:21,083
I've come to India for the first time, and somebody is firing at me!

1568
01:58:21,250 --> 01:58:23,250
I mean, it makes no sense.

1569
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:27,291
Neither do I know anybody here nor does anybody know me.

1570
01:58:27,375 --> 01:58:31,083
Why would anybody fire at an unknown person?

1571
01:58:47,833 --> 01:58:49,541
They know this face!

1572
01:58:50,833 --> 01:58:52,000
What do you mean?

1573
01:58:53,375 --> 01:58:55,750
Just the way you had wrongly believed that I was Rohit,..

1574
01:58:57,041 --> 01:58:58,833
.. even they could be misled.

1575
01:59:02,125 --> 01:59:06,708
They are not trying to kill me but Rohit!

1576
01:59:06,916 --> 01:59:09,125
What! Kill Rohit?!

1577
01:59:09,750 --> 01:59:11,179
Was he involved in any shady issue?

1578
01:59:11,205 --> 01:59:11,816
- Not at all.

1579
01:59:11,875 --> 01:59:13,791
He was a very simple boy.

1580
01:59:14,125 --> 01:59:15,394
How did he die?

1581
01:59:15,420 --> 01:59:16,941
- In an accident.

1582
01:59:18,041 --> 01:59:22,583
He may not have died in an accident but got killed instead.

1583
01:59:23,041 --> 01:59:27,000
Got killed? What are you saying!

1584
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:29,791
I cannot be certain.

1585
01:59:31,458 --> 01:59:33,291
However, the present situation indicates so.

1586
01:59:34,750 --> 01:59:37,041
Else, why would anybody fire at a stranger?

1587
01:59:38,166 --> 01:59:40,000
And then, they have tapped the phone at your house.

1588
01:59:42,291 --> 01:59:43,875
There's certainly something fishy.

1589
01:59:44,833 --> 01:59:48,583
You saw Rohit and Sonia together at the airport?!

1590
01:59:49,458 --> 01:59:51,000
You then fired at them?!

1591
01:59:52,500 --> 01:59:55,458
And then, you dared to tap the telephones at my house?!

1592
01:59:55,791 --> 01:59:57,083
And pursued them again!

1593
01:59:57,166 --> 01:59:59,125
Yes, sir. But Kadam was also with me!

1594
01:59:59,208 --> 02:00:01,250
Kadam, did you see Rohit?

1595
02:00:01,333 --> 02:00:04,208
No. I did not see Rohit.

1596
02:00:04,291 --> 02:00:06,041
Because they had disappeared again.

1597
02:00:06,125 --> 02:00:09,166
Hey! Tell me something.

1598
02:00:09,750 --> 02:00:14,416
Explain to me how one can see a dead man alive!

1599
02:00:14,791 --> 02:00:16,833
This is the effect of your drinking!

1600
02:00:16,916 --> 02:00:18,538
Sir, that is irrelevant!

1601
02:00:18,564 --> 02:00:19,958
Have I become blind?

1602
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:21,118
I saw him myself!

1603
02:00:21,144 --> 02:00:22,525
- Shut up, you fool!

1604
02:00:24,125 --> 02:00:27,750
Had Rohit been alive, we'd have been behind bars now!

1605
02:00:27,833 --> 02:00:30,541
And because of your stupidity, Sonia has still not come home!

1606
02:00:30,625 --> 02:00:34,708
Sir..
- Now go and seek the help of the police force and bring her back!

1627
02:00:38,750 --> 02:00:39,560
Don't get worked up.

1628
02:00:39,586 --> 02:00:40,233
We'll find her.

1629
02:00:41,333 --> 02:00:42,875
They are the same people who were following us last night.

1630
02:00:42,958 --> 02:00:45,125
Yes. But what are they doing outside my house?

1631
02:00:45,291 --> 02:00:47,250
Perhaps they are waiting for you to return home.

1632
02:00:58,583 --> 02:01:00,666
I think he's deploying his men outside.

1633
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:03,166
I hope dad is not in danger.

1634
02:01:04,666 --> 02:01:06,625
I think we should inform the cops.
- Yes.

1635
02:01:06,833 --> 02:01:07,958
Let's go.

1636
02:01:12,166 --> 02:01:12,708
What is this!

1637
02:01:12,734 --> 02:01:14,900
What were you doing inside for the past two hours?!

1638
02:01:14,958 --> 02:01:15,965
What had you eaten?

1639
02:01:15,991 --> 02:01:17,316
Sleeping pills or food?!

1640
02:01:17,458 --> 02:01:19,375
Did you attend somebody's wedding?!

1641
02:01:19,458 --> 02:01:19,964
You were in for two hours.

1642
02:01:19,990 --> 02:01:20,650
Does this belong to your father?

1643
02:01:20,708 --> 02:01:22,500
This is for the officers, not for constables!

1644
02:01:24,791 --> 02:01:26,625
Hello! Hey!

1645
02:01:27,250 --> 02:01:28,375
Who's this impertinent fellow?!

1646
02:01:31,250 --> 02:01:32,416
It's all right.

1647
02:01:41,666 --> 02:01:44,916
Inspector, we are here to lodge a complaint.
- Really?

1648
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:46,750
While coming from the airport last night, a man..

1649
02:01:46,833 --> 02:01:50,958
Airport.
And this is a police station!

1650
02:01:51,500 --> 02:01:56,458
There are so many facilities at the airport for people, right?

1651
02:01:56,583 --> 02:01:59,148
They can stand or sit as they wish!

1652
02:01:59,174 --> 02:02:00,566
There's enjoyment!

1653
02:02:00,625 --> 02:02:02,125
But here..! Hey!

1654
02:02:02,666 --> 02:02:05,000
Inspector, we have a problem.

1655
02:02:29,083 --> 02:02:31,875
We've been wanting to tell you something for so long.

1656
02:02:31,958 --> 02:02:33,208
Can you hear or not?!

1657
02:02:34,250 --> 02:02:37,416
I don't have the strength to hear or understand.

1658
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:41,750
I have never controlled before, this is the first time.

1659
02:02:44,416 --> 02:02:45,583
What is it?

1660
02:02:46,791 --> 02:02:50,250
We came out of the International Airport last night, and someone..

1661
02:02:51,666 --> 02:02:52,791
Someone..

1662
02:02:57,500 --> 02:03:01,958
Yes, Parab.
She is Sonia Saxena.

1663
02:03:03,208 --> 02:03:05,583
She has run away with this boy named Rohit.

1664
02:03:06,250 --> 02:03:09,666
Make copies of these photos and send it to all the police stations.

1665
02:03:10,208 --> 02:03:16,166
Remember! Wherever you see them, arrest them immediately!

1666
02:03:20,666 --> 02:03:22,875
I think I have seen them somewhere.

1667
02:03:22,958 --> 02:03:25,125
Where?
- That's what I'm thinking, sir.

1668
02:03:25,208 --> 02:03:26,500
Think fast!

1669
02:03:26,625 --> 02:03:27,851
Please don't scream.

1670
02:03:27,877 --> 02:03:30,941
I'm in such a position that anything can happen.

1671
02:03:35,666 --> 02:03:38,367
Sir, they are right here!

1672
02:03:38,393 --> 02:03:41,525
They are right here with me!

1673
02:03:41,583 --> 02:03:42,750
Come!

1674
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:44,746
Where are they?

1675
02:03:44,772 --> 02:03:45,566
- They're gone.

1676
02:03:46,708 --> 02:03:48,083
Parab! - Yes?

1677
02:03:48,166 --> 02:03:50,333
Are you sure it was them?
- Yes.

1678
02:03:50,500 --> 02:03:51,958
Look at it intently!

1679
02:04:06,583 --> 02:04:07,791
Turn right!

1680
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:37,041
Why are the police following us?

1681
02:04:37,625 --> 02:04:40,666
I can't fathom a thing!

1682
02:04:40,958 --> 02:04:43,000
The police are pursuing us, and so are the hoodlums.

1683
02:04:59,166 --> 02:05:00,375
Let's go!

1684
02:05:01,625 --> 02:05:04,036
Hey, Rohit!

1685
02:05:04,062 --> 02:05:06,691
Hey, Rohit!

1686
02:05:06,916 --> 02:05:09,083
You're alive, Rohit?!

1687
02:05:09,416 --> 02:05:10,513
Where were you?

1688
02:05:10,539 --> 02:05:12,170
What happened to you?

1689
02:05:12,196 --> 02:05:13,050
Answer me!

1690
02:05:13,333 --> 02:05:15,375
We wept uncontrollably for you!

1691
02:05:16,208 --> 02:05:19,375
Why did you harass us so much?!

1692
02:05:20,333 --> 02:05:21,541
Answer me!

1693
02:05:21,666 --> 02:05:24,125
Your younger brother, Amit.

1694
02:05:24,708 --> 02:05:27,375
He has become mute, hearing about your death.

1695
02:05:27,458 --> 02:05:28,916
He doesn't speak a word.

1696
02:05:29,916 --> 02:05:32,536
If he sees you, he'll be thrilled.

1697
02:05:32,562 --> 02:05:34,025
Come on, let's go.

1698
02:05:35,958 --> 02:05:39,736
Look, what I've got for you!

1699
02:05:39,762 --> 02:05:41,650
An aeroplane!

1700
02:05:41,708 --> 02:05:45,916
Remember you'd tell Rohit, you can't be a pilot without a plane?

1701
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:47,200
So I've brought you one.

1702
02:05:47,226 --> 02:05:48,525
Look at the way it flies!

1703
02:05:55,041 --> 02:05:57,125
Amit! Look at this aeroplane!

1704
02:05:57,750 --> 02:06:00,791
I've cooked chicken for you.

1705
02:06:01,208 --> 02:06:03,083
You're very fond of chicken, right?

1706
02:06:07,416 --> 02:06:08,583
Yes!

1707
02:06:09,708 --> 02:06:11,000
Inspector Shinde.

1708
02:06:12,041 --> 02:06:14,333
We are pursuing a hardcore criminal.

1709
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:16,416
He's hiding in this area.

1710
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:18,600
The Police Force is looking for him.

1711
02:06:18,626 --> 02:06:19,691
Come on, go and search!

1712
02:06:20,458 --> 02:06:22,833
But nobody has come here, sir.

1713
02:06:23,458 --> 02:06:25,166
I mean..

1714
02:06:26,041 --> 02:06:27,541
That's for me to see.

1715
02:06:29,250 --> 02:06:30,625
Who is it?

1716
02:06:49,583 --> 02:06:50,310
What's wrong?

1717
02:06:50,336 --> 02:06:51,733
- Is this Rohit's house?

1718
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:52,714
Stop joking!

1719
02:06:52,740 --> 02:06:54,941
Don't you recognise your own house?

1720
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:56,247
Sir, we searched the whole house.

1721
02:06:56,273 --> 02:06:57,066
There's nobody here.

1722
02:06:57,125 --> 02:06:58,833
What are they doing at your house?

1723
02:06:59,125 --> 02:06:59,916
Let's go from here.

1724
02:06:59,942 --> 02:07:01,066
I'll tell you everything.

1725
02:07:05,625 --> 02:07:08,166
Yes, Tony. And this is the truth.

1726
02:07:09,500 --> 02:07:10,875
I just can't believe it!

1727
02:07:12,375 --> 02:07:14,333
This is God's miracle!

1728
02:07:14,791 --> 02:07:16,833
He looks exactly like Rohit!

1729
02:07:17,041 --> 02:07:20,000
I feel, the more I think about it, the crazier I'll become!

1730
02:07:20,041 --> 02:07:22,750
I'll go and arrange for some food.

1731
02:07:41,375 --> 02:07:41,867
This is..

1732
02:07:41,893 --> 02:07:43,150
- Rohit's tune. Right?

1733
02:07:43,291 --> 02:07:44,323
But how do you..

1734
02:07:44,349 --> 02:07:46,733
- The notes are written in his book.

1735
02:07:47,291 --> 02:07:48,791
And music is my hobby.

1736
02:07:53,166 --> 02:07:55,333
This was the song which he was going to sing at the show.

1737
02:07:57,041 --> 02:07:59,333
Do you remember the lyrics of this song?

1738
02:08:02,083 --> 02:08:03,291
Somewhat..

1739
02:08:18,333 --> 02:08:21,750
"The heart..

1740
02:08:22,583 --> 02:08:28,125
..has sent a message."

1741
02:08:44,541 --> 02:08:47,416
"My destination.."

1742
02:08:51,458 --> 02:08:54,750
"Destination.."

1743
02:08:56,208 --> 02:09:01,541
"..is your love."

1744
02:09:10,083 --> 02:09:17,208
"You're my anchor!"

1745
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:18,125
Tony!

1746
02:10:19,583 --> 02:10:21,375
Damn! What do I eat?

1747
02:10:23,291 --> 02:10:24,916
There's nothing to eat here!

1748
02:10:25,458 --> 02:10:28,916
An egg. How does one prepare it?

1749
02:10:34,541 --> 02:10:37,083
1. 2.

1750
02:10:40,375 --> 02:10:42,333
Is this how you shake an egg in your country?

1751
02:10:42,875 --> 02:10:44,083
What!

1752
02:10:44,500 --> 02:10:45,281
I mean break..

1753
02:10:45,307 --> 02:10:47,316
Is this how you break an egg here?

1754
02:10:47,458 --> 02:10:50,291
Why?
How do they break it in your country?

1755
02:10:58,916 --> 02:11:00,625
And how do they beat it?

1756
02:11:05,375 --> 02:11:07,041
And how do they cut onions?

1757
02:11:18,875 --> 02:11:20,666
Add some green chilly, too. Okay?

1758
02:11:20,916 --> 02:11:23,083
Will you do anything or not?!

1759
02:11:23,166 --> 02:11:25,791
I will! I will eat from your hand!

1760
02:11:31,875 --> 02:11:33,833
At your fate!

1761
02:11:36,041 --> 02:11:37,250
Am I wrong?

1762
02:11:37,333 --> 02:11:40,708
I mean, feet.. At your feet!

1763
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:43,375
So, what type of an omelette would you prefer?

1764
02:11:43,541 --> 02:11:46,875
Spanish, Japanese, cheese, sphagnum, ham..

1765
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:56,875
God, help me. "The policeman."

1766
02:11:56,958 --> 02:11:58,416
Hey! Where are you going?

1767
02:11:58,666 --> 02:12:02,125
Can't you see that I'm the milkman?

1768
02:12:02,208 --> 02:12:04,666
I've been here since 4 days but I've never seen you before.

1769
02:12:04,750 --> 02:12:08,125
That must have been my pop.. my father must have come here.

1770
02:12:08,208 --> 02:12:10,958
Father? But a lady was here yesterday.

1771
02:12:11,791 --> 02:12:16,791
A lady? That must have been my mother.

1772
02:12:16,875 --> 02:12:18,708
Does your entire family sell milk?

1773
02:12:20,250 --> 02:12:21,758
Make me a constable, sir.

1774
02:12:21,784 --> 02:12:24,316
There's no extra income in selling milk!

1775
02:12:24,458 --> 02:12:26,041
Go inside!

1776
02:12:26,125 --> 02:12:28,750
Milk!

1777
02:12:28,833 --> 02:12:29,736
Milk! - Yes?

1778
02:12:29,762 --> 02:12:31,191
Whom do you want?

1779
02:12:31,250 --> 02:12:34,625
I'm the milkman! Tony!

1780
02:12:34,833 --> 02:12:36,541
Stop saying Tondu!

1781
02:12:36,625 --> 02:12:40,041
And I drink only buffalo milk! Go!

1782
02:12:40,125 --> 02:12:42,332
Don't go in!
I'll call the police!

1783
02:12:42,358 --> 02:12:42,941
- Uncle!

1784
02:12:44,208 --> 02:12:46,833
Hey! Tony, you!

1785
02:12:58,375 --> 02:12:59,541
What's the matter?

1786
02:13:01,458 --> 02:13:03,291
I was wondering if Amit..

1787
02:14:26,625 --> 02:14:28,041
Sir, there! - Police!

1788
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:30,125
Aunty!

1789
02:14:53,750 --> 02:14:56,133
Come this way.
Move aside!

1790
02:14:56,159 --> 02:14:56,983
Come on!

1791
02:14:59,833 --> 02:15:03,250
Move aside!

1792
02:15:03,333 --> 02:15:04,708
Don't block the way.

1793
02:15:09,875 --> 02:15:12,166
Move aside! This way!

1794
02:15:16,250 --> 02:15:17,791
Move away!

1795
02:15:18,416 --> 02:15:19,686
Move aside. Move aside.

1796
02:15:19,712 --> 02:15:20,650
Get to one side.

1797
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:25,541
Get aside. Get aside.

1798
02:15:25,625 --> 02:15:27,375
Get aside. Get aside.

1799
02:15:27,458 --> 02:15:29,166
What is he doing?

1800
02:15:30,541 --> 02:15:32,291
Get aside. Get aside.

1801
02:15:32,375 --> 02:15:33,916
Move aside. Move aside.

1802
02:15:37,041 --> 02:15:38,333
Pick him up.

1803
02:15:40,250 --> 02:15:41,416
Raj!

1804
02:15:45,375 --> 02:15:47,583
Sonia, run. Sonia. Run.

1805
02:16:20,250 --> 02:16:22,291
How much for this? - 200, Sir.

1806
02:16:26,916 --> 02:16:28,000
Sonia?

1807
02:16:31,333 --> 02:16:32,073
Oh my God!

1808
02:16:32,099 --> 02:16:34,316
Sonia, where have you been?!

1809
02:16:34,666 --> 02:16:36,375
Your dad is worried sick about you.

1810
02:16:36,458 --> 02:16:37,875
All of us are worried about you..

1811
02:16:37,958 --> 02:16:38,592
We have been looking for you..

1812
02:16:38,618 --> 02:16:39,400
- There's an important announcement.

1813
02:16:39,666 --> 02:16:43,000
This is Sonia Saxena's photo who has been missing from home.

1814
02:16:43,041 --> 02:16:47,958
The one who provides information about her will be duly rewarded.

1815
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,708
She's fair, 5 feet 3 inches tall..
- Mumy..

1816
02:16:50,791 --> 02:16:52,916
..has black eyes and brown hair.
- Let's go!

1817
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:56,208
Anyone who sights this girl may contact at this number.

1818
02:16:56,291 --> 02:16:59,666
Manager! She is the one!

1819
02:17:01,208 --> 02:17:02,333
Stop!

1820
02:17:04,041 --> 02:17:05,250
Take your positions!

1821
02:17:09,041 --> 02:17:10,916
Somebody from here reported about a girl.

1822
02:17:10,942 --> 02:17:11,566
Where is she?

1823
02:17:11,625 --> 02:17:13,041
She.. - She escaped, sir.

1824
02:17:13,125 --> 02:17:13,826
Escaped?..

1825
02:17:13,852 --> 02:17:16,000
And was there a boy with her?

1826
02:17:16,041 --> 02:17:17,625
Yes, there was.

1827
02:17:23,500 --> 02:17:24,708
It was this boy, right?

1828
02:17:25,166 --> 02:17:27,416
No, he wasn't the one.

1829
02:17:31,833 --> 02:17:36,750
With whose permission did you flash Sonia's picture on TV?!

1830
02:17:36,833 --> 02:17:39,875
Sir, I felt it was the best option to catch Sonia and Rohit.

1831
02:17:39,958 --> 02:17:41,597
Rohit.. Rohit.. Rohit..

1832
02:17:41,623 --> 02:17:42,691
Are you nuts?!

1833
02:17:42,750 --> 02:17:46,208
Didn't that lady clearly tell you that it was some other boy with Sonia?!

1834
02:17:46,375 --> 02:17:49,875
Hey, Kadam! What is the matter with this fool!

1835
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,625
Looking at your stupidity, I feel like shooting you!

1836
02:17:53,666 --> 02:17:55,000
Hello. - Hello, Daddy.

1837
02:17:55,208 --> 02:17:57,708
Sonia, where are you?

1838
02:17:57,791 --> 02:17:59,926
I can't tell you, Daddy!

1839
02:17:59,952 --> 02:18:02,441
Your phone has been tapped.

1840
02:18:02,500 --> 02:18:04,458
And there's a ring of policemen outside the house.

1841
02:18:04,541 --> 02:18:05,847
I'm perfectly fine.

1842
02:18:05,873 --> 02:18:07,316
I'll call you again.

1843
02:18:07,458 --> 02:18:09,041
Hello? - What's wrong?

1844
02:18:14,833 --> 02:18:16,708
Have you deployed your force outside my house?

1845
02:18:16,791 --> 02:18:17,916
Yes, sir.
- Why?!

1846
02:18:18,791 --> 02:18:20,708
You know that Sonia's life is in danger!

1847
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:22,958
Then why don't you want her to return home?!

1848
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:25,464
There are no restrictions on her coming home.

1849
02:18:25,490 --> 02:18:26,400
It's for Rohit..

1850
02:18:26,458 --> 02:18:27,583
Rohit again!

1851
02:18:28,041 --> 02:18:30,083
If you don't stop mentioning Rohit,..

1852
02:18:30,166 --> 02:18:31,625
.. I'll have you sacked from the Force!

1853
02:18:31,708 --> 02:18:33,083
Rohit is dead!

1854
02:18:41,083 --> 02:18:42,250
Sonia! Amit?

1855
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:48,125
How have you come here?

1856
02:18:48,500 --> 02:18:52,666
Brother, I have come to take you home.
Come on.

1857
02:18:53,875 --> 02:18:57,416
No, Amit.
It's not advisable for me to come home now.

1858
02:18:57,750 --> 02:19:02,708
I know.
You're afraid that the cops will fire at you again.

1859
02:19:04,541 --> 02:19:06,958
How do you know that?

1860
02:19:07,166 --> 02:19:09,166
I had witnessed everything.

1861
02:19:10,125 --> 02:19:11,291
What?

1862
02:19:11,666 --> 02:19:15,208
I was waiting for you on the day of your show.

1863
02:19:15,750 --> 02:19:17,791
You were supposed to take me for it.

1864
02:19:17,958 --> 02:19:20,542
I wanted to give you a present.

1865
02:19:20,568 --> 02:19:23,150
So I went to a shop to buy it.

1866
02:19:23,375 --> 02:19:26,541
When I returned, I saw..

1867
02:19:59,291 --> 02:20:02,125
Sirjee, Rohit has witnessed everything.

1868
02:20:07,208 --> 02:20:09,333
Who is Sirjee?

1869
02:20:11,500 --> 02:20:13,523
Amit, can you identify those 3 men?

1870
02:20:13,549 --> 02:20:15,108
Have you seen them before?

1871
02:20:15,250 --> 02:20:18,208
No. But if I see them, I will be able to identify them.

1872
02:20:19,041 --> 02:20:22,291
But where will we get to see all three of them together?

1873
02:20:22,583 --> 02:20:26,250
There is a way to get the three of them together.

1874
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:28,375
I will have to come to the forefront.

1875
02:20:28,916 --> 02:20:31,708
They will think that I'm Rohit and try to attack me again.

1876
02:20:32,083 --> 02:20:33,416
And then, Amit will identify them.

1877
02:20:34,125 --> 02:20:37,208
But the question is, how do I come to the forefront?

1878
02:20:38,875 --> 02:20:40,458
Hey! I have an idea.

1879
02:20:41,041 --> 02:20:43,875
Why don't we announce the show which Rohit had left incomplete?

1880
02:20:44,333 --> 02:20:47,000
We'll put posters all over the city saying, Rohit is back!

1881
02:20:47,083 --> 02:20:51,041
That's a fantastic idea!

1882
02:20:51,208 --> 02:20:55,041
When they hear about the show, they will have to come here!

1883
02:20:55,125 --> 02:20:57,291
We'll place TV cameras everywhere,

1884
02:20:57,375 --> 02:20:58,601
..and those.. what's it called?

1885
02:20:58,627 --> 02:20:59,733
- Close circuit television.

1886
02:20:59,791 --> 02:21:01,708
Yes! Amit will identify them on it!

1887
02:21:01,791 --> 02:21:04,083
Hey! Good idea, man. Good idea.

1888
02:21:04,166 --> 02:21:07,583
But nobody else, other than us, should learn about it.

1889
02:21:07,708 --> 02:21:09,432
Atul, let's make the arrangements.

1890
02:21:09,458 --> 02:21:10,066
- Let's go.

1891
02:21:25,583 --> 02:21:26,750
Sonia!

1892
02:21:31,083 --> 02:21:32,321
What's the matter, Sonia?

1893
02:21:32,347 --> 02:21:33,733
Why are you standing alone?

1894
02:21:34,541 --> 02:21:36,583
You are going back. - Going back?

1895
02:21:37,333 --> 02:21:38,435
And what about the show?

1896
02:21:38,461 --> 02:21:39,608
- There will be no show!

1897
02:21:39,875 --> 02:21:41,745
I will not let any show take place!

1898
02:21:41,771 --> 02:21:42,358
- Why not?

1899
02:21:42,875 --> 02:21:44,916
Don't you want Rohit's killers to be found?

1900
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:48,375
Yes, I do! But not at the cost of putting your life in danger!

1901
02:21:48,791 --> 02:21:50,416
Anything can happen in the show!

1902
02:21:50,708 --> 02:21:52,375
I'm not bothered about my life.

1903
02:21:53,041 --> 02:21:54,958
At least, you'll find out the truth.

1904
02:21:55,166 --> 02:21:58,416
But why do you want to risk your life for me?!

1905
02:22:02,041 --> 02:22:03,166
Why?!

1906
02:22:04,083 --> 02:22:08,083
Because I love you.

1907
02:22:27,250 --> 02:22:29,875
Look at this! Rohit is back.

1908
02:22:30,541 --> 02:22:31,916
He's holding a show.

1909
02:22:35,250 --> 02:22:36,821
All of you slapped me!

1910
02:22:36,847 --> 02:22:38,775
You thought I was insane!

1911
02:22:39,125 --> 02:22:41,375
You threatened to have me sacked!
- Shinde..

1912
02:22:41,458 --> 02:22:42,583
Leave me!

1913
02:22:42,666 --> 02:22:44,800
My brains have rotted, drinking!

1914
02:22:44,826 --> 02:22:46,025
Right?! Now look!

1915
02:22:46,166 --> 02:22:48,000
See the messenger of your death for yourself!

1916
02:22:48,083 --> 02:22:50,019
Shinde is so confident.

1917
02:22:50,045 --> 02:22:52,233
Let's go and take a look.

1918
02:22:52,291 --> 02:22:54,000
Fine! Let's go!

1919
02:22:54,083 --> 02:22:55,625
Hats off to your common sense!

1920
02:22:56,375 --> 02:22:59,208
If he is indeed Rohit and sees all of you together,..

1921
02:22:59,291 --> 02:23:00,541
.. he will identify you.

1922
02:23:00,750 --> 02:23:02,208
And we'll be in a tight spot then!

1923
02:23:02,500 --> 02:23:04,375
I am the only one he hasn't seen.

1924
02:23:05,625 --> 02:23:06,833
I'll go and see him.

1925
02:23:06,958 --> 02:23:10,235
Rohit! Rohit!

1926
02:23:10,261 --> 02:23:12,025
Rohit!

1927
02:23:12,083 --> 02:23:14,166
Everyone knows what they have to do?
- Yes.

1928
02:23:14,250 --> 02:23:14,955
All right then.

1929
02:23:14,981 --> 02:23:15,733
Let's go, guys.

1930
02:23:15,791 --> 02:23:17,541
And let's do it right. Good luck.

1931
02:23:18,083 --> 02:23:20,333
Atul, we must start operating the cameras..

1932
02:23:20,416 --> 02:23:21,811
..and the monitors immediately.

1933
02:23:21,837 --> 02:23:22,691
- Okay. And Tony..

1934
02:23:29,375 --> 02:23:30,310
What's the matter, Amit?

1935
02:23:30,336 --> 02:23:31,816
Why are you looking at me like that?

1936
02:23:32,750 --> 02:23:34,750
Aren't you my brother?

1937
02:23:38,416 --> 02:23:39,541
Who says so?

1938
02:23:40,208 --> 02:23:43,125
Everybody says that you are not my brother Rohit.

1939
02:23:47,458 --> 02:23:48,833
What does your heart say?

1940
02:23:49,333 --> 02:23:51,000
That you are my brother.

1941
02:23:53,750 --> 02:23:55,208
Even my heart says the same.

1942
02:24:07,541 --> 02:24:08,801
Amit! Come on. Come fast.

1943
02:24:08,827 --> 02:24:10,691
We have to go to the monitory room.

1944
02:24:10,750 --> 02:24:13,625
Come. Hurry up.

1945
02:24:13,833 --> 02:24:15,958
That's a good boy. Let's go!

1946
02:24:17,250 --> 02:24:18,458
Raj!

1947
02:24:22,750 --> 02:24:23,916
All the best.

1948
02:24:24,541 --> 02:24:25,833
And take care.

1949
02:24:25,916 --> 02:24:26,680
Hey, Sonia!

1950
02:24:26,706 --> 02:24:28,858
Your dad is here to meet you.

1951
02:24:28,916 --> 02:24:30,041
Daddy?

1952
02:24:32,666 --> 02:24:33,875
Daddy! - My child!

1953
02:24:34,416 --> 02:24:36,458
What's all this?

1954
02:24:37,208 --> 02:24:39,083
You've come here long back but have been missing?

1955
02:24:39,458 --> 02:24:41,583
Where were you all along and with whom?

1956
02:24:41,666 --> 02:24:44,000
And what's all this about Rohit being back and his show?

1957
02:24:44,083 --> 02:24:47,458
Daddy, he's not Rohit but Raj Chopra.

1958
02:24:47,666 --> 02:24:51,250
Raj Chopra?
- Yes. He looks just like Rohit.

1959
02:24:51,333 --> 02:24:53,511
I met him in New Zealand.

1960
02:24:53,537 --> 02:24:57,108
He's helping us find Rohit's murderers.

1961
02:24:58,583 --> 02:25:01,125
Rohit's murderers?

1962
02:25:01,708 --> 02:25:06,000
Rohit! Rohit!

1963
02:25:12,500 --> 02:25:14,916
Two policemen shot Rohit?

1964
02:25:16,541 --> 02:25:17,875
What proof do you have?

1965
02:25:17,958 --> 02:25:19,016
There is proof.

1966
02:25:19,042 --> 02:25:22,566
Rohit's younger brother, Amit, has witnessed it.

1967
02:25:22,625 --> 02:25:24,125
Sonia, the show is about to begin.

1968
02:25:24,208 --> 02:25:26,500
Come on. - Carry on. I'll join you.

1969
02:25:30,458 --> 02:25:35,125
Rohit! Rohit! Rohit!

1970
02:25:35,333 --> 02:25:36,522
Malik, where are you?

1971
02:25:36,548 --> 02:25:37,566
- In the stadium.

1972
02:25:37,625 --> 02:25:38,302
Are you mad?!

1973
02:25:38,328 --> 02:25:40,150
I had asked you not to come here!

1974
02:25:40,208 --> 02:25:43,250
Don't worry. Even you will not be able to recognise me!

1975
02:25:43,333 --> 02:25:47,958
Sonia has told me everything but don't do anything foolish.

1976
02:25:48,458 --> 02:25:50,583
He is not Rohit but his look-alike Raj.

1977
02:25:50,875 --> 02:25:52,083
Raj Chopra!

1978
02:26:52,416 --> 02:26:55,750
"Music will echo amidst a gathering of stars."

1979
02:26:55,833 --> 02:26:59,083
"My heart sings."

1980
02:26:59,166 --> 02:27:05,291
"Her heart yearns for me."

1981
02:27:05,458 --> 02:27:08,833
"Here I am."

1982
02:27:08,916 --> 02:27:12,916
"Once again."

1983
02:27:13,041 --> 02:27:19,041
"My destination is your love."

1984
02:27:19,125 --> 02:27:27,208
"I'm the ocean and you are the shore."

1985
02:27:29,958 --> 02:27:33,208
"Music will echo amidst a gathering of stars."

1986
02:27:33,291 --> 02:27:36,625
"My heart sings."

1987
02:27:36,708 --> 02:27:42,958
"Her heart yearns for me."

1988
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:46,333
"Here I am."

1989
02:27:46,416 --> 02:27:51,125
"Once again."

1990
02:28:27,916 --> 02:28:34,958
"My feet have lead me to that path."

1991
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:41,208
"Where we are facing each other."

1992
02:28:41,666 --> 02:28:54,916
"Our eyes have met in secrecy."

1993
02:28:55,083 --> 02:28:58,666
"Your secret is an honour to me."

1994
02:28:58,750 --> 02:29:03,458
"What do they hint?"

1995
02:29:03,541 --> 02:29:07,208
"Is my heart an aim or is he aiming at my heart?"

1996
02:29:07,291 --> 02:29:10,375
"One in love is engrossed."

1997
02:29:10,458 --> 02:29:16,666
"My heart sings. Her heart yearns for me."

1998
02:29:16,791 --> 02:29:24,458
"Here I am once again."

1999
02:29:24,541 --> 02:29:30,416
"My destination is your love."

2000
02:29:30,500 --> 02:29:37,750
"I'm the ocean and you are the shore."

2001
02:29:37,833 --> 02:29:41,208
"Music will echo amidst a gathering of stars."

2002
02:29:41,291 --> 02:29:44,708
"My heart sings."

2003
02:29:44,791 --> 02:29:48,125
"Music will echo amidst a gathering of stars."

2004
02:29:48,208 --> 02:29:52,250
"My heart sings."

2005
02:30:02,875 --> 02:30:05,000
Are you with me?

2006
02:30:05,041 --> 02:30:07,916
Yes!

2007
02:30:08,583 --> 02:30:10,625
Can you feel it?

2008
02:30:10,708 --> 02:30:13,541
Yes!

2009
02:30:15,041 --> 02:30:16,666
Then let's go for it.

2010
02:30:33,416 --> 02:30:41,125
"My heart craves to hear you say that you love me."

2011
02:30:41,208 --> 02:30:44,500
"Say that you love me."

2012
02:30:44,583 --> 02:30:48,041
"Say that you love me."

2013
02:30:54,833 --> 02:30:58,250
"Love is what brings us together."

2014
02:30:58,333 --> 02:31:02,541
"Love is what the world rests in."

2015
02:31:02,625 --> 02:31:05,791
"Say that you love me."

2016
02:31:05,875 --> 02:31:09,166
"Say that you love me."

2017
02:31:09,250 --> 02:31:12,458
"Say that you love me."

2018
02:31:12,541 --> 02:31:15,666
"Say that you love me."

2019
02:31:15,750 --> 02:31:19,000
"Say that you love me."

2020
02:31:19,083 --> 02:31:22,291
"Say that you love me."

2021
02:31:22,375 --> 02:31:25,583
"Say that you love me."

2022
02:31:25,666 --> 02:31:29,291
"Say that you love me."

2023
02:31:47,375 --> 02:31:48,541
Thank you.

2024
02:31:50,333 --> 02:31:52,048
Thank you, friends.

2025
02:31:52,074 --> 02:31:53,066
Thank you.

2026
02:31:54,791 --> 02:31:59,375
It's only your love that has saved me from the jaws of death.

2027
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:06,000
This is a kind of miracle, an incredible incident.

2028
02:32:06,958 --> 02:32:09,708
A dead man stands before you today.

2029
02:32:10,791 --> 02:32:15,375
A man who was said to have died in an accident.

2030
02:32:18,041 --> 02:32:21,958
But, friends, he did not die in an accident.

2031
02:32:23,583 --> 02:32:25,125
He was murdered.

2032
02:32:30,666 --> 02:32:36,041
Perhaps God kept me alive so that I could tell you the truth.

2033
02:32:37,541 --> 02:32:39,708
So that I could show you those killers.

2034
02:32:42,208 --> 02:32:43,833
And reveal their identities to you.

2035
02:32:45,583 --> 02:32:51,708
So that they could get punished both by God and the law.

2036
02:32:53,625 --> 02:32:54,833
Their..

2037
02:32:57,416 --> 02:33:00,916
Excuse me, sir, would you please switch off your mobile phone?

2038
02:33:06,250 --> 02:33:07,500
And now..

2039
02:33:09,375 --> 02:33:11,083
.. I'm going to reveal their names.

2040
02:33:14,416 --> 02:33:15,958
They were three of them.

2041
02:33:19,166 --> 02:33:22,666
Two of them were police inspectors.

2042
02:33:28,541 --> 02:33:29,708
And their names are..

2043
02:33:33,750 --> 02:33:34,916
Their names are..

2044
02:33:36,416 --> 02:33:37,708
Hey, what happened?

2045
02:33:39,625 --> 02:33:41,583
Brother! - Raj.

2046
02:33:46,500 --> 02:33:48,478
Raj. Are you all right?

2047
02:33:48,504 --> 02:33:50,566
- I am okay. I am okay.

2048
02:34:01,458 --> 02:34:04,000
Malik, I'd told you not to do anything!

2049
02:34:04,083 --> 02:34:08,875
Don't shout! You conspire with your daughter to have us trapped!

2050
02:34:09,291 --> 02:34:11,208
Rohit hasn't seen you.

2051
02:34:11,500 --> 02:34:13,041
It will be the three of us who will get trapped!

2052
02:34:13,250 --> 02:34:15,041
Now, you watch my maneuver!

2053
02:34:27,916 --> 02:34:30,041
Hello.
- Give the phone to Rohit!

2054
02:34:31,083 --> 02:34:33,375
Raj! There's a call for Rohit!

2055
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:40,291
Hello!
- You've been very smart!

2056
02:34:40,750 --> 02:34:42,708
Before revealing our names, hear this voice!

2057
02:34:42,791 --> 02:34:43,916
Leave me!

2058
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:45,125
Leave me! - Sonia!

2059
02:34:46,333 --> 02:34:47,495
You heard her voice?

2060
02:34:47,521 --> 02:34:48,566
Now listen to me!

2061
02:34:49,208 --> 02:34:51,000
There's a white car waiting outside.

2062
02:34:51,166 --> 02:34:53,833
Its number is MH-O2-M-3818.

2063
02:34:54,250 --> 02:34:56,541
Memorise the number. She is waiting.

2064
02:34:56,625 --> 02:34:58,083
Come alone. Understood?

2065
02:34:58,791 --> 02:35:00,125
What's the matter?

2066
02:35:00,958 --> 02:35:02,041
They have kidnapped Sonia.

2067
02:35:02,125 --> 02:35:03,250
Oh my God.

2068
02:35:03,333 --> 02:35:05,708
They've asked me to come alone.
- Listen.

2069
02:35:10,208 --> 02:35:11,416
What's wrong?

2070
02:35:21,458 --> 02:35:22,625
Hello.

2071
02:35:22,708 --> 02:35:25,875
Start the car, and do as tell you.

2072
02:35:31,666 --> 02:35:33,041
Turn right.

2073
02:35:37,208 --> 02:35:39,125
Now enter the gate ahead of you.

2074
02:36:05,583 --> 02:36:08,791
I'm here! Release Sonia!

2075
02:36:08,958 --> 02:36:11,375
No, Raj! Go away or..

2076
02:36:11,791 --> 02:36:14,250
Come here and take her away!

2077
02:36:35,250 --> 02:36:36,416
Sir!

2078
02:36:37,291 --> 02:36:38,500
He's not here!

2079
02:36:43,541 --> 02:36:44,708
Rohit!

2080
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:48,375
If you don't show up before I count 3..

2081
02:36:48,458 --> 02:36:50,750
..you will see another dead body!

2082
02:36:50,916 --> 02:36:52,208
One!

2083
02:36:57,583 --> 02:36:59,125
Two!

2084
02:37:15,125 --> 02:37:16,291
He won't heed this way!

2085
02:37:18,291 --> 02:37:21,291
Call him! - I won't!

2086
02:37:23,041 --> 02:37:25,250
Call Rohit! - I won't!

2087
02:37:30,208 --> 02:37:31,375
Call him!

2088
02:37:40,291 --> 02:37:41,416
Scream!

2089
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:13,583
Rohit, come out!

2090
02:38:15,208 --> 02:38:17,185
Kadam, he won't come.

2091
02:38:17,211 --> 02:38:20,316
Her death will beckon him here!

2092
02:39:43,750 --> 02:39:47,291
Hit them, Raj. Hit them.

2093
02:39:47,875 --> 02:39:50,208
Kill them, Raj! Kill them!

2094
02:39:59,750 --> 02:40:01,750
Come on, Raj! Kill them.

2095
02:40:06,541 --> 02:40:08,041
Kill them, Raj!

2096
02:40:10,458 --> 02:40:14,583
Kill them, Raj!

2097
02:40:24,125 --> 02:40:26,041
Uncle? You!

2098
02:40:32,750 --> 02:40:34,000
Yes, me.

2099
02:40:34,291 --> 02:40:36,958
Misfortune and circumstances compelled me to do this.

2100
02:40:37,416 --> 02:40:39,166
And you're seeing this facet of me.

2101
02:40:39,250 --> 02:40:43,750
But why do you want to kill us?

2102
02:40:45,125 --> 02:40:48,583
Because Rohit had seen us murder the commissioner.

2103
02:40:51,166 --> 02:40:52,750
I am shocked.

2104
02:40:52,833 --> 02:40:56,708
You'll be shocked now, when I tell you..

2105
02:40:57,166 --> 02:41:00,083
.. the name of my fourth accomplice.

2106
02:41:01,666 --> 02:41:03,291
Would you like to hear his name?

2107
02:41:11,500 --> 02:41:12,666
Daddy!

2108
02:41:30,000 --> 02:41:31,125
Brother!

2109
02:41:33,291 --> 02:41:37,166
He is the same man who had called Sirjee.

2110
02:42:57,583 --> 02:43:00,041
What's all this?

2111
02:43:00,625 --> 02:43:02,000
So, you are Sirjee?

2112
02:43:06,166 --> 02:43:09,458
Daddy, you! You also..

2113
02:43:12,041 --> 02:43:13,250
Yes.

2114
02:43:15,000 --> 02:43:16,541
I have committed a crime.

2115
02:43:18,541 --> 02:43:21,750
And I hid it from you..

2116
02:43:23,416 --> 02:43:25,583
.. and the world, as well.

2117
02:43:26,958 --> 02:43:29,791
However, I could not hide it from Him!

2118
02:43:31,500 --> 02:43:35,500
Nobody knows when He'll punish,..

2119
02:43:36,541 --> 02:43:40,583
.. in which form, and how.

2120
02:43:43,000 --> 02:43:44,333
Please forgive me, dear.

2121
02:44:02,375 --> 02:44:03,541
Raj!

2122
02:44:09,916 --> 02:44:11,208
Where are you going, Raj?

2123
02:44:12,500 --> 02:44:18,666
I'm taking Amit with me, and going back to my house.

2124
02:44:20,375 --> 02:44:21,600
What about me?

2125
02:44:21,626 --> 02:44:23,900
Won't you take me along?

2126
02:44:29,083 --> 02:44:30,929
I have lost my love once.

2127
02:44:30,955 --> 02:44:33,316
I don't want to lose it again.

2128
02:44:37,375 --> 02:44:38,500
Say it.

2129
02:44:39,875 --> 02:44:41,041
Say it just once..

2130
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:44,541
Say you love me.

2131
02:45:12,958 --> 02:45:14,708
"My heart throbs to see you."

2132
02:45:14,791 --> 02:45:16,375
"Come, let's unite."

2133
02:45:16,458 --> 02:45:21,000
"It's an expression of love."

2134
02:45:21,083 --> 02:45:24,625
"Say, you love me!"

2135
02:45:24,708 --> 02:45:28,041
"I love you!"
