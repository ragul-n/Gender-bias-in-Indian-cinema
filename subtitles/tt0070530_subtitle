1
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:11,622
Mother! Father!

2
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,324
Father!

3
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,497
What happened?
- What happened, Shanta?

4
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:20,229
He didn't come.

5
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:21,430
It's one 0' clock.

6
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:22,631
I knew it.

7
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:24,299
One day he'll go and never return.

8
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:27,743
The people of Japan, Africa, Nepal,
Bhutan keep guests at home.

9
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:29,271
That too for months.

10
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:31,007
For years! But they never
keep their son-in-law!

11
00:04:31,137 --> 00:04:32,673
Shanta! Yes!

12
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:35,478
Just because he was
an ordinary writer.

13
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,588
He didn't used to do the illegal
and smuggling business.

14
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:39,588
He could not have earned
a lot of money.

15
00:04:39,912 --> 00:04:41,619
That's why neither you allowed
me to go with him.

16
00:04:41,914 --> 00:04:43,018
Nor you let him stay in the house.

17
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:45,258
He used to enter his own
house like a thief.

18
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:46,455
What happened?

19
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:47,689
Oh God!

20
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:49,491
You?

21
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:50,692
What's the matter?

22
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:52,196
Huh! Oh shucks!

23
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:53,766
This is too much!

24
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,666
What a nuisance! Come on, dear.

25
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:05,144
Why do you come late; dear Gopal?

26
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:07,209
You know that impatient girl.

27
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:10,944
Shanta, go. The food is ready.

28
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:12,247
Go and feed him.

29
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,220
Where were you? Where were you?

30
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,422
Where were you?

31
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:22,498
I was at the distant of one
hand from you, Shanta.

32
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:24,296
You didn't spread your arms.

33
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:26,494
Yes! My name is Shanta.

34
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:28,733
I am so impatient from within.

35
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,172
Actually I had gone
to one publisher.

36
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:33,471
Whatever it is! You return home
as soon as it is evening!

37
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:37,180
When it is night; then I don't
know what happens to me!

38
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,174
All right! All right, darling!

39
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:40,774
I will not be late from tomorrow.

40
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:42,277
Come.

41
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:55,957
Psst! Psst!

42
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:06,976
It's true! When men go out then
sometimes they get late.

43
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:08,939
Now will you stop blabbering or not?

44
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:11,612
This girl has ruined her life.

45
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:13,740
Along with her she has
ruined our lives too!

46
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,348
Now did you see?

47
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:16,978
He'll write for the entire night.

48
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,147
And he'll keep the lights
on for the entire night.

49
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:19,348
This Shekhar Gopal!

50
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:24,987
You read me and write me.

51
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:27,123
Am I less than any book?

52
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:31,331
You are a lot more beautiful
than it, my darling!

53
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:34,131
I ask you; till when will
you keep awake at nights?

54
00:06:35,294 --> 00:06:37,900
Even you keep me awake. Don't you?

55
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:40,137
Shucks! Don't you have any shame?

56
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,477
I will keep awake till
that time, Shanta.

57
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:44,275
Till I don't earn enough money.

58
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:45,474
Till I don't purchase a house.

59
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:47,482
And until I don't
take you from here.

60
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:49,280
Your father..
- Let your father say anything.

61
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:52,115
Neither I will stay here
nor let you stay here.

62
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:56,458
Listen, you don't earn
a lot of money.

63
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:58,095
Why? Why shouldn't I earn?

64
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:01,555
No female wants that her husband
should be very rich.

65
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:02,958
Why, darling?

66
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:04,460
You don't understand.

67
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:06,464
Then he doesn't belong
to her anymore.

68
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:08,395
But your father and your mother.

69
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:10,702
Oh yes, yes! You have seen
mother, haven't you?

70
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,976
She is living. Yes?

71
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:16,179
You don't worry, my Shanta.

72
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:21,444
A writer never has the danger
to earn more money.

73
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:23,345
Did you understand?

74
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:26,150
Aren't we less in number today?

75
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:31,087
Oh yes, pal! This is the
problem with the oldies.

76
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,627
Today someone is present;
tomorrow he is no more!

77
00:07:36,255 --> 00:07:38,531
Oh, yes! Go! Your controlling
power if very weak!

78
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:41,331
Pal Rajjab Ali!
- Yes?

79
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,873
I have heard you have married
some unmarried girl.

80
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:46,103
At your native place.
- Yes!

81
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,673
Hey, neither you have intestines
nor teeth, scoundrel!

82
00:07:48,734 --> 00:07:50,213
Hey but, doctor Effendi.

83
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:54,647
After all what one has to do
with teeth in a marriage.

84
00:07:57,076 --> 00:07:59,386
You find some medicine, Rajjab Ali.

85
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:02,092
If not lying down; then at least
you'll be able to sit.

86
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:04,889
Wow. Come on; brothers. Now
even the roads are tired!

87
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,221
Come on! Come on!
- Let's go!

88
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:14,830
You wretched fellow!
So you are spying?

89
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,064
My eyesight is weak.

90
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:17,265
That's why I am spying.

91
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:18,500
Here, even you spy a little!
- Give me!

92
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:24,645
Hey, just look! Just look!

93
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:26,979
Our Indian brothers are too much!

94
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:28,546
Where-where they grasp
an opportunity!

95
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:32,951
They all are our guests.

96
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,426
The husband is Indian and the
wife is Japanese. - Yes.

97
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,730
I think he is romancing with her!

98
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:45,364
Damle, I heard there is some guests
have arrived at your place!

99
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:47,666
Mr. Nasir, all these
are businessmen.

100
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,930
Oh! Those ones! Those ones!

101
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:50,472
The dumb ones with crooked faces!

102
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:54,343
Yesterday night my daughter
did a drama in front of them.

103
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,541
Come there.

104
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:00,378
Day by day you are making
your daughter a neurotic.

105
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,384
Towards her husband; because
of your attitude.

106
00:09:03,442 --> 00:09:05,547
That poor one is always fearful
and insecure regarding him.

107
00:09:06,412 --> 00:09:10,189
Mr. Nasir, first that girl married
against my wishes. - I see!

108
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:12,826
At least she should
have found a man..

109
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:13,989
...Equal to me and my position.

110
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:16,597
That pauper; worthless writer!

111
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,893
What does one gets by
writing down on paper?

112
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:23,063
I tried to involve
him in my business.

113
00:09:23,462 --> 00:09:24,907
You know; what he said?

114
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:27,433
The man who does the adulteration
of grains.

115
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:29,376
He is not ready to work with him.

116
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:33,748
In fact this is a proof of his
honesty and high status!

117
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,716
<i>High status mam? My foot!</i>

118
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:39,018
He has written an article about
the entire business community.

119
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:42,551
Whoever reads it; he'll recognise
that I am its villain.

120
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:45,519
By just looking at him
my anger is aroused!

121
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,489
That scoundrel!

122
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:49,690
He back bites the person
who feeds him!

123
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:52,527
I know him very well, Damle.

124
00:09:52,658 --> 00:09:54,660
He is a very self respected
and a sincere boy.

125
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,471
Forget the food of your house.

126
00:09:56,562 --> 00:09:58,132
He is not even ready
to drink the water.

127
00:09:58,297 --> 00:10:00,299
He comes to your house
only for this reason.

128
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:02,910
Because he is madly
in love with Shanta.

129
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:04,948
Listen to one thing carefully.

130
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:08,016
These writers and artists
are very sensitive!

131
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:10,343
The day their self respect is hurt.

132
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:13,652
Hey, what story have you
two started telling?

133
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:14,983
Come on!

134
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:16,519
Listen brother!
- Yes?

135
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:18,526
Some people are arriving for
dinner at my place tonight.

136
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:20,357
Oh! Those with the crooked faces?

137
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,580
Shamrao, today is Tuesday, isn't it?

138
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:38,113
Yes brother, today is Tuesday.

139
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:41,443
Oh! But why does it seem old?

140
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:46,420
All right! Wednesday is pure!

141
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:49,322
Yes! That is true!

142
00:10:58,124 --> 00:10:59,728
Are you a psychiatrist?

143
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,229
What is she speaking?

144
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,430
She says are you mental doctor?

145
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:05,171
No madam, for you kind information.

146
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:06,742
I am not a mad doctor.

147
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,971
In fact I am a doctor
of the mad ones.

148
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:12,542
Hey listen, pal Effendi.
- Yes?

149
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:14,879
When some man comes to you.
- Yes, yes.

150
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,987
How do you come to know he is mad?

151
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:19,186
Firstly when he talks like you.

152
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,525
After that by looking at him.

153
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:24,252
Come pal Effendi, I'll introduce
you to some people.

154
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:25,521
Oh yes, I am coming.

155
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:29,558
Greetings, brother doctor.

156
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,134
Oh yes! Greetings, sister-in-law.

157
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:32,895
Sister-in-law, today you are
looking very beautiful!

158
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:37,169
He is Mr. Marker, the king
of the race course.

159
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:38,366
He is doctor Effendi.

160
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:40,101
Oh, oh! I understood! I understood!

161
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:42,778
The people start the food course
and he starts the race course.

162
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:45,605
I regularly do the race course,
doctor Effendi.

163
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:46,809
But this wretched Shamrao!

164
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:48,417
He makes money directly.

165
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,018
He is Seth Chunibhai.

166
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:53,556
Overseas film distributor.

167
00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:55,017
He is doctor Effendi.

168
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:56,492
How are you, Mr. Chunibhai?

169
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:57,957
I am fine! I am fine!

170
00:11:58,084 --> 00:12:00,394
Chunibhai, you might never
have purchased any films.

171
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:03,557
Then how do the films reach to
America in the vegetable basket?

172
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,129
Effendi!
- Yes?

173
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,433
Pal, this man's eyes
are not in focus.

174
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:11,599
He'll look that way.

175
00:12:11,697 --> 00:12:12,937
You'll think he is looking
towards you.

176
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:15,670
Which man? He?
- Yes.

177
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:17,744
He is Prince Rustogia, the banker.

178
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:18,974
Doctor Effendi.

179
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:20,776
Greetings! How are you?

180
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:25,386
Whom are you asking?

181
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:26,582
I am addressing you.

182
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:29,023
What are you with me?
- Addressing! Addressing!

183
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:32,125
Oh, oh! So you are addressing
me and I am addressing you.

184
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,321
That's it!

185
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:34,522
The food is laid out, sir.

186
00:12:34,653 --> 00:12:35,927
Oh! Thank God! Thank God!

187
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:37,898
Please come. Come.

188
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:42,970
Oh wow! Fantastic!

189
00:12:43,295 --> 00:12:46,538
Dear, you were telling that the
skirt top won't suit you. Yes?

190
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:48,339
Hey uncle, I forgot to thank you.

191
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:49,538
It's very beautiful!

192
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:50,978
It's very beautiful, isn't it?
- Yes. - Come now.

193
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:57,015
Please come, dear. Sit here.

194
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:00,015
Come! Come!

195
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:01,817
Oh yes! Sit down, sister-in-law!

196
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:04,152
Ahaa!

197
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:08,523
Start eating, brothers.

198
00:13:10,322 --> 00:13:12,495
But some people have
still not arrived.

199
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,299
I know! But what will he
do coming to this party?

200
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:20,269
Let's start!

201
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:34,983
Greetings, sir!

202
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:37,892
Hey shoo! Shoo off!

203
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:49,099
I am sorry.
- I thought the party must be over.

204
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:51,941
I was waiting for you only, Gopu.

205
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:55,575
By the way, Mr. Damle,
who is this gentleman?

206
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:56,971
You eat food.

207
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:03,612
There is no vacant chair.

208
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:05,077
You please sit here.

209
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:06,648
Sit down, Viju.

210
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:13,894
You sit, I.. I will change
clothes and come.

211
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:32,873
I am not enjoying today, Shamrao.

212
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,245
Why, what happened?

213
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:37,579
I don't like it.

214
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:41,456
Uncle...?
- You eat food, dear.

215
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,186
I can't bear to see this.

216
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:46,219
Brother. .
- No, sister-in-law.

217
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:50,760
Hey, you all eat, brothers.

218
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:17,152
Gopu!

219
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,426
Shanta, I am here!

220
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:26,233
Forgive me! Please forgive me.

221
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:28,528
Daily he criticizes you.

222
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:29,731
And he humiliates you.

223
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:32,672
Hey, that man is humiliated,
darling.

224
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:34,710
The one who has any respect!

225
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:37,212
Shucks! If you'll say this
thing again then I..

226
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:38,406
What will you do?

227
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:40,375
I..I..

228
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:45,682
As if you will not need me again!

229
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:52,259
Shanta, you love me
very much, don't you?

230
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:54,764
Move aside! You have
made me unhappy.

231
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,561
Is my love such; that
you have a need to ask?

232
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:00,530
There is no need, Shanta.

233
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:04,903
But I don't know why I feel like
asking you again and again!

234
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:11,105
I walk with you love
like this, Gopu!

235
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:14,509
As one walks in a storm
with a lamp in hand.

236
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:17,753
Why? Do you fear anything?

237
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:24,152
Yes, I fear that what if
you leave me and go away?

238
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:27,262
All my family members.. - I am not
bothered about your family members.

239
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:30,499
Yes but if you say anything
wrong some day..

240
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:33,263
No darling! Do you see this?

241
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:37,232
I know! You writers and artists
are very sensitive!

242
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:38,533
Yes darling!

243
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:57,787
Will there be any shortage of
saris with sister-in-law?

244
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:01,761
Mr. Hitashi, Shanta has
thousands of saris.

245
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:05,695
But she'll become so happy by
getting one sari of my earnings.

246
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:07,927
You can never guess this!

247
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:12,900
The matter is such, that I strictly
don't prefer giving an advance.

248
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:16,472
At the end of the year I
pay the entire accounts.

249
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:20,410
I am not talking about the
accounts but feelings!

250
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,610
So we'll do one thing.

251
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:25,849
By which we both will be satisfied.

252
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:30,289
You consider this as the advance.

253
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:32,053
And I'll consider this as a debt.

254
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:40,096
How will I buy a good
sari in 100 rupees?

255
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:41,329
Then give it back.

256
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,871
I mean you take it afterwards.

257
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:44,332
Yes? What do you want?

258
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:45,907
Do you have Mr. Gopal's
novel, 'Agla Kadam'?

259
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:47,102
Yes, of course.
- Please give me.

260
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:50,470
Laxmi, bring Mr. Gopal's
novel, 'Agla Kadam.'

261
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:53,075
Just see the copy will be in
front on the third shelf.

262
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,866
After all what price
sari do you want?

263
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:18,101
Err.. around 100 or 125 rupees.

264
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:21,139
There is no question of Banarasi
sari at this low price range.

265
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:23,447
Yes! This costs 86
rupees fifty paisa!

266
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:26,243
This is very inferior.

267
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:29,112
This.. how much is this for?

268
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:33,048
This costs 166 rupees.
- No.

269
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:36,952
Listen.

270
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:43,192
You.. are Shamrao Damle's
son-in-law? - Yes.

271
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:44,934
Then why are you talking
about money?

272
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:46,327
The money will be taken later.

273
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:47,528
No!

274
00:18:48,026 --> 00:18:50,973
Listen! Please listen!
Please listen..

275
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:55,340
It's Holi today!

276
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:56,537
Hey, colour him!

277
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:01,611
Happy Holi!
- Same to you!

278
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:12,089
Come on Shanta, let's play Holi.

279
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:13,691
No, no. He is going to come.

280
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:15,092
I'll go and change my sari.

281
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,290
Then we'll play. Okay?

282
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:19,394
Come, Shanta.

283
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:22,134
Hey listen; it's such
an expensive sari.

284
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:24,335
She'll change it first
and then play. Okay?

285
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,268
We will not put colours
on her. Please come.

286
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:27,469
Hey but..

287
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:58,137
"O' play Holi with your beloved."

288
00:19:58,263 --> 00:19:59,901
"Play Holi with your beloved."

289
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:03,140
"Play Holi with your beloved."

290
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:04,508
"Phagun has arrived."

291
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:07,174
"O' Phagun has arrived!"

292
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:10,783
"Drench your drape, O fair lass."

293
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:12,286
"Phagun has arrived."

294
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:14,721
"O' Phagun has arrived."

295
00:20:15,614 --> 00:20:16,684
"Dhin-Na-tinak-dhin."

296
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:17,986
"Dhin-din-tinak-dhin."

297
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,358
"Dhin-din-tinak-dhin."

298
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:20,521
"Dhin-din-tinak-dhin."

299
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:22,921
"Ta-ta-ta ! "

300
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,227
"Dhin-Na-tinak-dhin."

301
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:25,393
"Dhin-din-tinak-dhin."

302
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:26,594
"Dhin-din-tinak-dhin."

303
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:27,897
"Dhin-din-tinak-dhin."

304
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:57,799
"Wherever you see!"

305
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,161
"There is a commotion!"

306
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:03,004
"The glosses fly in the lane."

307
00:21:03,228 --> 00:21:05,105
"And the colours in the sky."

308
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,271
"Somewhere someone, Oh my, my!"

309
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:12,676
"Stares lovingly at the body!"

310
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,578
"The story of love moves ahead."

311
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:17,415
"And the cheeks are blush!"

312
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:20,455
"Someone teases the beloved."

313
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:22,719
"Someone teases the beloved."

314
00:21:22,914 --> 00:21:24,120
"Phagun has arrived."

315
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:26,622
"O' Phagun has arrived!"

316
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:28,556
"Dhin-Na-tinak-dhin."

317
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:29,893
"Dhin-din-tinak-dhin."

318
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,161
"Dhin-din-tinak-dhin."

319
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,360
"Dhin-din-tinak-dhin."

320
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:35,001
"Ta-ta-ta ! "

321
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:56,424
"Someone says, O lover girl,
listen to the call."

322
00:21:57,215 --> 00:22:02,688
"Your beloved has arrived
after many years."

323
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:10,971
"Today you definitely embrace me."

324
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:16,138
"With the excuse of
Holi; meet once."

325
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:23,253
"There are colours on my body."

326
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:25,781
"There are colours on my heart."

327
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:30,458
"Some beloved had put colours!"

328
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:35,093
"Across the garden."

329
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,657
"O' fair lass your beloved
awaits you."

330
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:42,201
"With love in eyes and
glow on the face."

331
00:22:58,944 --> 00:23:00,355
My sari was so expensive!

332
00:23:00,645 --> 00:23:02,420
What right you have
to spoil that thing?

333
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:04,083
Which you can't buy
and give me yourself?

334
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:12,730
You are telling the
right thing, Shanta.

335
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:16,237
The thing which I can't buy for you.

336
00:23:17,362 --> 00:23:19,399
I had no right to spoil it also.

337
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,204
I didn't have any right.

338
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,241
I didn't have any right.

339
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:48,905
Goodness me! Was this
a less punishment?

340
00:23:49,294 --> 00:23:51,535
You had reduced me to
a living dead body!

341
00:23:51,696 --> 00:23:53,505
Now you have converted my
daughter to the same!

342
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:55,909
Oh God!

343
00:23:56,201 --> 00:23:57,305
Harsuiya!

344
00:23:57,502 --> 00:23:58,572
Harsuiya is no more!

345
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:01,816
Hey, how many children do we have?

346
00:24:02,507 --> 00:24:04,384
After all everything belongs to her.

347
00:24:04,976 --> 00:24:07,422
Will we take all this
with us when we die?

348
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:08,650
I say..
- Silent!

349
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:11,428
You didn't allowed sister-in-law
to live peacefully all her life.

350
00:24:11,516 --> 00:24:12,995
Now you are stopping her
from weeping also?

351
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:14,889
You shut up!
This is my family matter.

352
00:24:15,253 --> 00:24:16,323
Shamrao!

353
00:24:17,322 --> 00:24:18,426
I am sorry, Effendi.

354
00:24:20,492 --> 00:24:21,562
Come inside the room.

355
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:31,743
Greetings!
- Greetings!

356
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:33,274
Have a seat.

357
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:36,883
Come, Jagyani Seth!
- Greetings, brother.

358
00:24:37,008 --> 00:24:38,715
Sit down! Sit down!
- How did you come?

359
00:24:39,377 --> 00:24:41,414
Your son-in-law had come to
purchase sari for your daughter.

360
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,057
He had less money so
he returned back.

361
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:44,794
I went on telling him to take it.

362
00:24:44,883 --> 00:24:45,953
The money will be taken later.

363
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:52,493
Gopu!

364
00:24:52,591 --> 00:24:54,730
Hey? What's this? - Hey, pick her
up, make her sit on the chair.

365
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:55,996
But what has happened to her?
- Control her!

366
00:24:56,294 --> 00:24:57,364
Come, dear.

367
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:58,634
Oh yes, yes! Lie down on this chair.

368
00:24:59,364 --> 00:25:00,900
Hey, bring a glass of water.
Bring a glass of water.

369
00:25:02,701 --> 00:25:05,307
Dear! My daughter is
my lifetime savings.

370
00:25:05,904 --> 00:25:07,008
What happened, brother doctor?

371
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:09,249
Sister-in-law!
- Yes?

372
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:14,949
Oh!

373
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:18,519
Mother?

374
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:27,928
Greetings, sir.

375
00:25:31,263 --> 00:25:32,333
Greetings, sir.

376
00:25:32,497 --> 00:25:34,875
Hey? You shouldn't run like
this at such time, dear.

377
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,340
Mother, did you come
to know anything?

378
00:25:38,937 --> 00:25:40,780
Father! Uncle!

379
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,143
Did you come to know anything?

380
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:45,446
Uncle!

381
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:46,918
We are telling you, dear.
We are telling you.

382
00:25:58,924 --> 00:26:02,098
Father! Mother! Please tell me.

383
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:05,837
Uncle! Speak! At least
speak something.

384
00:26:06,431 --> 00:26:07,501
What should I tell you, dear?

385
00:26:08,633 --> 00:26:09,703
We searched a lot.

386
00:26:10,268 --> 00:26:11,338
But we didn't come to know anything.

387
00:26:11,469 --> 00:26:13,642
I say, that rogue didn't
loved Shanta at all!

388
00:26:14,005 --> 00:26:15,109
Only because of my wealth..

389
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:17,208
Father!
- I am telling the right thing.

390
00:26:17,342 --> 00:26:19,344
This is a simple of desertion!

391
00:26:19,477 --> 00:26:21,479
Doctor, let the time pass.

392
00:26:21,613 --> 00:26:23,024
I will take divorce from the court.

393
00:26:23,281 --> 00:26:25,318
And get Shanta remarried again.

394
00:26:26,284 --> 00:26:27,388
Mother!

395
00:26:40,665 --> 00:26:41,871
This baby girl is born
in the seventh month.

396
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:44,741
We have kept her in the incubator.

397
00:26:45,537 --> 00:26:47,175
The chances of her survival
are fifty-fifty.

398
00:26:48,373 --> 00:26:49,579
Doctor!

399
00:26:49,674 --> 00:26:50,778
Sister-in-law!

400
00:27:38,857 --> 00:27:47,333
"O my beloved, he has
become heartless."

401
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:51,876
"Someone go and make him up."

402
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:55,416
"O my beloved!"

403
00:27:57,876 --> 00:28:01,619
"He didn't know my value."

404
00:28:01,713 --> 00:28:07,163
"O' he didn't know my value."

405
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:13,995
"He forgot me."

406
00:28:14,426 --> 00:28:21,435
"My beloved! He became heartless!"

407
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:25,604
"Someone go and make him up."

408
00:28:25,904 --> 00:28:29,147
"O my beloved!"

409
00:28:43,521 --> 00:28:51,872
"I fell in love with an
uncompassionate man."

410
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:59,780
"Without him I have gone crazy."

411
00:29:02,373 --> 00:29:05,377
"He didn't know my value."

412
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:12,084
"He forgot me."

413
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,821
"O my beloved."

414
00:29:17,555 --> 00:29:22,061
"Beloved, you don't know, how.."

415
00:29:22,861 --> 00:29:26,638
"..alone I am without you.."

416
00:30:31,529 --> 00:30:35,375
Dear, from today I am your father.

417
00:30:36,568 --> 00:30:37,774
You don't worry.

418
00:30:38,469 --> 00:30:39,709
You are not alone.

419
00:30:40,405 --> 00:30:41,577
I promise you.

420
00:30:42,974 --> 00:30:44,453
That I'll find out your husband.

421
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:12,947
Santosh, don't harass me.

422
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:15,279
Mangla, take her away from here.

423
00:31:18,576 --> 00:31:21,182
No, no, no! I'll stay here only.
- Dear, come here.

424
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:22,653
Okay, okay. Let her be here.

425
00:31:26,451 --> 00:31:27,521
Again the same thing.

426
00:31:27,652 --> 00:31:28,722
It's tickling me.

427
00:31:30,455 --> 00:31:31,525
What are you doing?

428
00:31:34,525 --> 00:31:36,596
Mummy, shall I light a cracker?

429
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:39,332
Yes, yes, but on the terrace.

430
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:48,077
Santosh! My butter toast!

431
00:31:56,314 --> 00:31:59,352
Baby has become four years old.
- Yes.

432
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:03,292
And now she'll become young
within some time. - Yes.

433
00:32:04,322 --> 00:32:05,665
Then you'll have to get her married.

434
00:32:06,057 --> 00:32:07,695
And she'll go away with her husband.

435
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:09,129
Leaving this house?

436
00:32:11,562 --> 00:32:12,905
What are you blabbering
standing here?

437
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:14,504
Don't you have any work at home?

438
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:15,703
Go away from here.

439
00:32:22,874 --> 00:32:24,547
Don't grow big so soon!

440
00:32:35,486 --> 00:32:38,023
Mangla, prepare the tea.

441
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:39,666
Santosh is going to
arrive from college.

442
00:32:58,209 --> 00:32:59,813
Hi Santosh! Listen!

443
00:33:04,048 --> 00:33:06,255
Hi! Why are you going
to college so late?

444
00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:07,521
My class was late today.

445
00:33:08,052 --> 00:33:10,089
And listen, Yasmin was calling you.

446
00:33:10,221 --> 00:33:11,291
She is at the hospital.

447
00:33:11,422 --> 00:33:12,492
I will meet her.

448
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:13,727
Okay! Bye-bye!
- Bye.

449
00:34:00,071 --> 00:34:03,382
Hi Santosh! Yeah!

450
00:34:04,108 --> 00:34:05,553
Sheena was telling
you had called me.

451
00:34:05,643 --> 00:34:07,213
Yes, I remembered you. Sit.

452
00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:10,951
What's the matter?

453
00:34:11,649 --> 00:34:13,890
I want that today you accompany me.
- Where?

454
00:34:14,285 --> 00:34:15,389
At the club!

455
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:18,060
Hey pal, what hunks come there!

456
00:34:18,456 --> 00:34:20,094
There is a lot of music
and dance there.

457
00:34:21,292 --> 00:34:23,863
And then slowly the lights go off!

458
00:34:23,961 --> 00:34:25,065
No, no, I can't go there.

459
00:34:25,329 --> 00:34:27,741
You killjoy! You always
blabber such things!

460
00:34:28,299 --> 00:34:29,937
Hey, I am not a free girl like you.

461
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:31,876
Mother waits for me every moment.

462
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:34,006
I can't even sit here for more time.

463
00:34:37,275 --> 00:34:38,618
Hey, you have grown up now.

464
00:34:38,776 --> 00:34:40,915
Till when you will bother
about your mother.

465
00:34:41,479 --> 00:34:43,789
Just breathe in the
fresh air of outside.

466
00:34:48,352 --> 00:34:50,423
I didn't mean to say this, silly.

467
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:51,659
I mean to say.

468
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:54,135
Shucks! Shameless girl!

469
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,166
It's great fun!

470
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,600
No pal, I am afraid.

471
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:01,433
Hey, these men are brave till
the time we are cowards!

472
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:04,741
You start teasing them first.

473
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:07,041
Then just see how they
perspire with fright!

474
00:35:10,508 --> 00:35:12,454
But won't you go to hospital today?

475
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:13,850
Hospital? Forget it!

476
00:35:14,245 --> 00:35:16,953
Huh! Today I have a new duty today!

477
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,726
Miss Shameful, I'll leave now.

478
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:26,359
BYE-bye!
" BYE-bye!

479
00:35:48,446 --> 00:35:50,255
So my darling daughter has arrived!
- Oh yes!

480
00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:54,622
Mama!
- Yes?

481
00:35:55,052 --> 00:35:57,931
Father was very handsome,
wasn't he? - Yes.

482
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:00,324
And you were impressed by him!

483
00:36:01,926 --> 00:36:02,996
What a personality, mother!

484
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:04,765
So big eyes.

485
00:36:06,631 --> 00:36:10,078
Mother, when father used to smile.

486
00:36:10,301 --> 00:36:11,371
Hey, what should I tell you?

487
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:13,573
The entire world used
to brighten up!

488
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:14,942
Mother!

489
00:36:15,439 --> 00:36:16,543
Father?

490
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:22,287
Come on run from here!
Come on, run. Go now.

491
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:44,472
You sat here again?

492
00:36:44,936 --> 00:36:46,438
I have refused you several times.

493
00:36:46,571 --> 00:36:48,050
Don't sit on this chair and table.

494
00:36:48,472 --> 00:36:49,974
If you want to study then
go down and study.

495
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,218
Mummy !
- Yes

496
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:58,451
I don't know what the matter is.

497
00:36:58,549 --> 00:36:59,653
But the people see me.

498
00:37:00,618 --> 00:37:02,689
What do they see?
- I don't know.

499
00:37:03,321 --> 00:37:04,561
When I go there then
they see from here.

500
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:05,996
And if I go here then
they see from there.

501
00:37:07,258 --> 00:37:10,239
Someone whistles at me
and someone.. - Huh?

502
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,642
Listen, you go directly
to the college from home.

503
00:37:14,865 --> 00:37:15,935
And come to home directly
from college.

504
00:37:16,467 --> 00:37:17,969
If anyone whistles at you
or makes passes on the way.

505
00:37:18,603 --> 00:37:21,049
Then you tell him clearly.

506
00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:22,409
Don't you have mother
or sister at home?

507
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,744
Okay?
- Yes.

508
00:37:45,896 --> 00:37:46,966
What are you staring at?

509
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:49,137
Don't you have mother
or sister at home?

510
00:37:50,401 --> 00:37:51,505
No!

511
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:54,678
No? Then what?

512
00:37:55,539 --> 00:37:56,779
'Mummy didn't tell
me anything else.'

513
00:37:59,877 --> 00:38:00,981
Oh God!

514
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:09,698
How are you, sweetheart?

515
00:38:11,422 --> 00:38:12,492
Yasmin!

516
00:38:13,858 --> 00:38:15,428
I am going to watch a movie.
- Will you come?

517
00:38:15,526 --> 00:38:17,028
No! I'll miss my college.

518
00:38:17,261 --> 00:38:19,502
Let it be missed!
- Oh shut up!

519
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:22,110
Sit down! Let's go!

520
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,381
Come on; let's go immediately.

521
00:38:31,509 --> 00:38:32,579
Shut the door properly.

522
00:38:39,884 --> 00:38:40,988
You stay behind, minor girl!

523
00:38:41,118 --> 00:38:42,222
This is an adult film.

524
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,424
No one will give you a ticket.

525
00:38:49,026 --> 00:38:52,473
Two balcony tickets! Thank you!

526
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:02,340
You? You can't go inside.

527
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,544
This is an adult film.

528
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:05,143
What do you think?
- I am the mother of a child.

529
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:13,158
Pal, how do you come to know
that the girl is adult?

530
00:39:13,284 --> 00:39:14,558
What should I tell you, pal?

531
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:16,498
I myself is an outsider.

532
00:39:16,654 --> 00:39:22,263
"O' about the water of the rains."

533
00:39:22,993 --> 00:39:28,306
"I will tell you; I'll
talk something to you."

534
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:35,245
"A light one! A light
one! A light one!"

535
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:08,078
"The foggy-foggy night; as
if it is the meeting bed."

536
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:21,887
"The foggy-foggy night; as
if it is the meeting bed."

537
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:33,033
"As if some moon rising and
hiding behind the clouds."

538
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:37,403
Oh wow!

539
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:40,042
Today I enjoyed a lot!
It was real fun!

540
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:42,247
Yes! And I missed my college.

541
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:43,443
If mother comes to know.

542
00:40:43,641 --> 00:40:45,314
Then I'll get so severe
scolding! Don't ask!

543
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:55,154
What is this? Yes?

544
00:40:56,053 --> 00:40:59,330
Hey, that only! Whatever that
happens in this world!

545
00:40:59,924 --> 00:41:00,994
What happens in the world?

546
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:02,928
Hey pal, you are totally dumb!

547
00:41:04,028 --> 00:41:06,201
Read this book; you'll
get some senses!

548
00:41:06,664 --> 00:41:08,075
They are the practical things!

549
00:41:09,266 --> 00:41:11,940
But listen, this book shouldn't
go in your mother's hands.

550
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:13,974
All right.

551
00:41:17,374 --> 00:41:18,444
This boy?

552
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:21,787
Hey, the same one whom
we met in the morning.

553
00:41:23,047 --> 00:41:26,460
Till today no girl had
the guts to refuse him.

554
00:41:29,053 --> 00:41:30,123
But this scoundrel!

555
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:32,365
He doesn't give a pass to any girl.

556
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:33,760
He does such a thing.

557
00:41:33,891 --> 00:41:35,734
As if he is not a boy but a father.

558
00:41:36,927 --> 00:41:38,929
If he were your father then..

559
00:41:39,363 --> 00:41:41,036
Oh God! I totally forgot.

560
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:42,402
Today there is an operation
at the hospital.

561
00:41:42,566 --> 00:41:44,102
Come on; drop me there while going.

562
00:41:44,368 --> 00:41:45,711
Please come now.

563
00:41:58,315 --> 00:41:59,453
No!!!

564
00:42:11,562 --> 00:42:12,666
What's wrong with you?

565
00:42:13,464 --> 00:42:14,534
What happened?

566
00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:15,969
What happened? Yes?

567
00:42:16,467 --> 00:42:20,347
He.. whose father was he?

568
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,610
Father?
- Yes.

569
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:28,421
You are a very manner less
and misbehaved girl.

570
00:42:29,613 --> 00:42:30,683
Why did you allowed
her to come inside?

571
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:32,952
I.. what did I know?

572
00:42:34,084 --> 00:42:37,156
Don't you know some people
can't see blood? Yes?

573
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:41,093
Now how are you, Miss..
- Santosh!

574
00:42:41,191 --> 00:42:42,295
Yes, Miss Santosh!

575
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:44,964
Yes?

576
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:47,034
I hate you.

577
00:42:50,701 --> 00:42:51,771
I hate you.

578
00:42:52,703 --> 00:42:54,808
Hey? This is too much!

579
00:43:00,711 --> 00:43:02,088
She lives in my area.

580
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,320
She studies in I.V. College.

581
00:43:04,515 --> 00:43:07,428
But why was she uttering
the father's name?

582
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,592
She doesn't have a father, doctor.

583
00:43:10,688 --> 00:43:13,362
I mean she had; but
she doesn't have now.

584
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:18,667
Mama!
- So you have arrived, dear!

585
00:43:20,364 --> 00:43:21,468
Mangla!

586
00:43:21,899 --> 00:43:23,310
Yes! Coming!

587
00:43:30,007 --> 00:43:34,683
Mummy, there is one boy
whom I hate a lot.

588
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:37,588
Why? What did he do?

589
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:40,626
He didn't do anything. - Then?

590
00:43:41,352 --> 00:43:42,456
Just like that!

591
00:43:46,557 --> 00:43:50,095
Listen girl, neither you have
to hate anyone or love!

592
00:43:50,527 --> 00:43:52,632
Don't dare to think anything
except your studies.

593
00:43:52,896 --> 00:43:55,240
Or think of anything else!
- Understood? Now go inside.

594
00:43:55,366 --> 00:43:57,778
Freshen up and change your clothes.
Go now.

595
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:02,041
I am leaving.

596
00:44:07,878 --> 00:44:09,186
Now it's her age, madam.

597
00:44:11,882 --> 00:44:14,692
Yes! If you won't search
a boy for her.

598
00:44:14,885 --> 00:44:16,091
Then she'll find one herself.

599
00:44:16,253 --> 00:44:18,733
No! Don't talk such things, Mangla!

600
00:44:24,261 --> 00:44:25,331
'Please come now.'

601
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:28,067
'I can't manage alone anymore.'

602
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:59,170
Huh? Aaah!

603
00:44:59,296 --> 00:45:00,366
Suman!

604
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:03,436
Move aside!

605
00:45:05,002 --> 00:45:08,313
Suman! I love you, Suman!

606
00:45:09,506 --> 00:45:10,576
Don't blabber!

607
00:45:10,908 --> 00:45:12,854
What is love; what does
a girl like you know?

608
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:21,089
You are not a girl.

609
00:45:21,652 --> 00:45:22,722
You are a dead body. A dead body!

610
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:25,260
The one whom anyone can
take and anywhere.

611
00:45:26,423 --> 00:45:27,493
Oh darling!

612
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,094
In spite of being a
modern man of today.

613
00:45:29,293 --> 00:45:30,567
You are talking such things.

614
00:45:31,028 --> 00:45:32,371
What's the matter of today
and future in this?

615
00:45:32,996 --> 00:45:36,876
A man always likes that girl who
has saved herself for him.

616
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:39,343
Understood?
- Oh, come on, Suman!

617
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:40,974
You be a boy only.

618
00:45:41,338 --> 00:45:42,578
Don't try to become my father.

619
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:45,118
Yes! Father is not
a worthless thing.

620
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:47,479
The girl who had not got
the love of a father.

621
00:45:47,611 --> 00:45:49,181
She keeps on wandering aimlessly.

622
00:45:49,279 --> 00:45:50,724
Just like you!
- Suman!

623
00:45:52,449 --> 00:45:54,019
Mean, rascally fellow!

624
00:45:54,485 --> 00:45:55,555
Who?
A rogue!

625
00:45:56,286 --> 00:45:57,890
Hey, this wretched doctor!

626
00:45:58,689 --> 00:46:00,327
No decent girl can marry him.

627
00:46:00,457 --> 00:46:01,527
Yes?

628
00:46:01,725 --> 00:46:03,762
No decent girl can marry him.

629
00:46:04,061 --> 00:46:05,335
Yasmin!
- Huh?

630
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:08,334
I'll be right back.

631
00:46:22,846 --> 00:46:23,950
Hello!

632
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:25,859
Oh! Hello!

633
00:46:26,517 --> 00:46:28,895
Is that man saved?
- Who?

634
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,028
That one.. the man that day.

635
00:46:31,555 --> 00:46:33,034
You.. you know..

636
00:46:35,325 --> 00:46:37,100
Yes! He'll recover in
some days and go away.

637
00:46:38,362 --> 00:46:39,705
Did his daughter and wife
come to meet him?

638
00:46:40,264 --> 00:46:42,574
Daughter?
- Yes. - He doesn't have a daughter.

639
00:46:42,866 --> 00:46:43,936
Yes, he has one son.

640
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:45,974
And his wife left him years before.

641
00:46:46,603 --> 00:46:49,379
Oh God! What's happening
in this world?

642
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:52,784
If I'll love someone; then
I'll never desert him.

643
00:46:53,677 --> 00:46:55,384
You mean after marriage?

644
00:46:58,348 --> 00:47:00,760
By the way, you are
a good man, doctor.

645
00:47:01,618 --> 00:47:02,688
But remember this.

646
00:47:04,354 --> 00:47:06,391
No decent girl will marry you.

647
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:07,594
Hey?

648
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:09,896
Listen!

649
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:13,274
Santosh! Santosh!

650
00:47:16,433 --> 00:47:17,503
Hey, at least listen to me.

651
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:32,588
Where have you brought me?

652
00:47:33,584 --> 00:47:34,688
I myself don't know.

653
00:47:35,319 --> 00:47:37,196
I went on steering and
the car went on!

654
00:47:52,469 --> 00:47:54,972
Actually I had come to warn
you regarding Yasmin.

655
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:56,977
Yes.

656
00:47:57,341 --> 00:47:58,479
She is a student doctor
for name sake.

657
00:47:58,609 --> 00:48:01,681
But she is not interested
in becoming a doctor.

658
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:03,217
At least she is interested
in a doctor!

659
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:04,882
What are you blabbering?

660
00:48:05,249 --> 00:48:06,489
She is an outline and a flirt girl.

661
00:48:06,617 --> 00:48:07,857
She wanders in the entire city.

662
00:48:08,285 --> 00:48:09,423
Don't you dare to meet her!

663
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:10,623
What do you mean?

664
00:48:13,624 --> 00:48:15,467
Who are you to order me?

665
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:19,072
I? If I were something of yours.

666
00:48:19,162 --> 00:48:20,266
Then had I just talked with you.

667
00:48:20,364 --> 00:48:21,468
Then what you would have done?

668
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:23,067
I would have caught your plait
and given you a tight slap!

669
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:24,303
Ouch!!!

670
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:26,711
On the way you are going. Just look!

671
00:48:27,437 --> 00:48:29,110
Do you want to die? Yes?

672
00:48:31,008 --> 00:48:33,545
Whether I live or die; why
are you concerned? Yes?

673
00:48:33,677 --> 00:48:36,180
Every boy wants that the
girl should fell down.

674
00:48:36,346 --> 00:48:37,416
And he should save her.

675
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:41,393
Mamma.

676
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:43,993
I have heard your father
has gone somewhere.

677
00:48:46,056 --> 00:48:49,469
Yes! There is no news about
him from 17 to 18 years.

678
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:53,541
But mummy still waits
for his return.

679
00:48:55,499 --> 00:48:57,501
She thinks he'll definitely
return some day.

680
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:01,674
My mother is not only
a Goddess, Suman!

681
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:05,849
She is my mother!

682
00:49:11,548 --> 00:49:12,686
You are very foolish!

683
00:49:15,419 --> 00:49:17,456
You? Who told you?

684
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:19,532
What? What he told me?

685
00:49:20,424 --> 00:49:21,528
This only. A foolish girl!

686
00:49:21,825 --> 00:49:22,895
Foolish girl?

687
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:26,469
Yes! When father used
to adore mummy a lot.

688
00:49:27,431 --> 00:49:29,433
Then he used to call mummy
as a foolish girl!

689
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:33,838
Oh! Err.. not a sweeper
but a washer woman.

690
00:49:35,238 --> 00:49:36,342
N'), a sweeper!

691
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:38,113
A washer woman! Sweeper!

692
00:49:38,208 --> 00:49:39,278
Washer woman!

693
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:41,285
Oh, oh! He used to
call her a sweeper.

694
00:49:41,445 --> 00:49:42,549
He must be calling
her a washer woman.

695
00:49:43,013 --> 00:49:44,253
I hate you!

696
00:49:44,881 --> 00:49:47,623
Really? Hate me a little more.

697
00:49:48,418 --> 00:49:49,488
Hate me a little more.

698
00:49:50,854 --> 00:49:51,924
A little more!

699
00:49:52,255 --> 00:49:53,325
A little more!

700
00:49:58,328 --> 00:50:01,741
Hey? Even my father had
so broad shoulders.

701
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:03,402
Really?
- Yes.

702
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:06,242
And so large eyes!

703
00:50:09,072 --> 00:50:10,745
I swear!
- Really?

704
00:50:15,312 --> 00:50:16,450
By the way, I will never marry.

705
00:50:18,215 --> 00:50:19,285
And if I'll marry
then only that man.

706
00:50:19,916 --> 00:50:21,122
The one who keeps mummy with him.

707
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:23,456
Then it's fine!

708
00:50:23,553 --> 00:50:24,896
If not a father, then
I'll get a mother.

709
00:50:25,589 --> 00:50:26,693
What do you mean?

710
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:27,960
Your parents?

711
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:29,769
I don't have them.
- I am an orphan.

712
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:31,403
It's such a good thing!

713
00:50:32,496 --> 00:50:33,770
It's a very sad thing.

714
00:50:34,331 --> 00:50:35,571
Doesn't matter!

715
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:37,774
I am a half orphan and
you are a full orphan.

716
00:50:38,268 --> 00:50:39,440
How much are we both together?

717
00:50:40,103 --> 00:50:42,982
One and a half orphan! Come on!

718
00:50:45,275 --> 00:50:46,345
Listen! Listen!

719
00:50:46,943 --> 00:50:48,650
Whenever you meet mummy.

720
00:50:50,414 --> 00:50:52,155
Then you tell her
that I study a lot.

721
00:50:52,949 --> 00:50:54,360
Yes, that is true!

722
00:50:56,586 --> 00:50:58,566
Come on. Scholar!

723
00:51:05,862 --> 00:51:06,932
Go!

724
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:11,743
Go now! Mother! Mother!

725
00:51:16,673 --> 00:51:17,981
Go! Go!

726
00:51:32,889 --> 00:51:33,959
Toshi!

727
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:54,047
He is that boy, isn't he?

728
00:51:54,344 --> 00:51:55,948
About whom you were telling me.

729
00:51:56,646 --> 00:51:57,716
Yes!

730
00:52:07,257 --> 00:52:08,702
Call him inside.
- But, mother.

731
00:52:11,661 --> 00:52:13,368
I am telling you. Go and call him.

732
00:52:14,865 --> 00:52:15,935
Mummy!

733
00:52:28,078 --> 00:52:29,489
Come, mummy is calling you.

734
00:52:29,613 --> 00:52:30,683
Mummy!?

735
00:52:31,214 --> 00:52:32,352
Hey, I was giving you so
many hints from when.

736
00:52:32,516 --> 00:52:33,961
And you were stuck
in your first gear!

737
00:52:34,084 --> 00:52:35,529
What should I do? In love.

738
00:52:35,919 --> 00:52:37,489
Only the first gear works!

739
00:52:38,922 --> 00:52:40,299
Come on; mummy seems to agree.

740
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:42,461
Hey, mummy seems to agree?

741
00:52:42,893 --> 00:52:44,770
I'll hit you! Shameless fellow!

742
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:51,979
Santosh, will your mummy hit me?

743
00:52:52,302 --> 00:52:53,406
So what happened!

744
00:52:53,603 --> 00:52:56,015
Get thrashed up! - Huh? - Can't
you do this much for me?

745
00:52:56,373 --> 00:52:57,818
No! I can never be thrashed up.
- That too for others!

746
00:52:58,241 --> 00:53:00,084
Please do this much for my sake!

747
00:53:00,544 --> 00:53:02,649
All right! I understood!
Please come.

748
00:53:04,714 --> 00:53:06,455
Give me your hand.- Here.

749
00:53:14,257 --> 00:53:15,497
Greetings, mother. Live long, dear.

750
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:19,932
Have a seat.

751
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:26,973
Are you still studying?

752
00:53:28,572 --> 00:53:29,983
Didn't Santosh tell you?

753
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:33,613
I have passed my MBBS
two years back.

754
00:53:34,311 --> 00:53:35,881
I am a house surgeon
at the hospital.

755
00:53:36,279 --> 00:53:38,054
And my salary is..
- You don't worry about that.

756
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:40,357
Your parents?

757
00:53:41,484 --> 00:53:44,158
They are no more.

758
00:53:45,288 --> 00:53:46,926
I have studied by giving tuitions.

759
00:53:49,693 --> 00:53:51,502
If I get you both married.

760
00:53:51,962 --> 00:53:53,134
Then will you live here?

761
00:53:54,130 --> 00:53:55,200
I have such a big house.

762
00:53:55,332 --> 00:53:56,402
And I am alone here.

763
00:53:56,533 --> 00:53:57,603
Mother..

764
00:53:58,635 --> 00:54:01,377
From the time he left;
he didn't return back.

765
00:54:03,273 --> 00:54:04,650
There will be a male in the house.

766
00:54:06,042 --> 00:54:07,180
You stay with us.

767
00:54:08,044 --> 00:54:10,456
Err.. I don't know where
I will get the job.

768
00:54:12,315 --> 00:54:13,419
It's one and the same thing.

769
00:54:13,850 --> 00:54:16,126
Whether I stay with you
or you stay at my place.

770
00:54:17,854 --> 00:54:18,924
Please wait!

771
00:54:42,379 --> 00:54:43,449
What is this, mother?

772
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:44,784
This is your auspicious gift.

773
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:47,353
I'll start preparing for
your marriage from now.

774
00:54:55,592 --> 00:54:57,003
You don't worry about the clothes.

775
00:54:57,193 --> 00:54:58,297
I'll do all that.

776
00:54:58,495 --> 00:55:00,168
You just give your measurement.

777
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:03,740
Mother!
- Live long!

778
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:10,114
Yes, yes! Go dear! Go and leave him.

779
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:11,944
Go!

780
00:55:13,443 --> 00:55:14,547
Thank you, mother.

781
00:56:01,491 --> 00:56:02,561
Listen! Listen!

782
00:56:04,327 --> 00:56:05,829
Whatever mother has given you.

783
00:56:06,229 --> 00:56:07,503
Give back to me.
- Why?

784
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:12,745
Now listen, I am your future wife.

785
00:56:12,836 --> 00:56:13,940
Really?

786
00:56:14,904 --> 00:56:17,748
So whatever you'll earn;
you'll give it to me.

787
00:56:17,907 --> 00:56:19,682
And I'll return it
to you one by one.

788
00:56:20,143 --> 00:56:21,213
This will not happen.

789
00:56:21,344 --> 00:56:22,414
Why it won't happen?

790
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:23,615
My Wish!
- Hey?

791
00:56:25,515 --> 00:56:27,859
"When do they agree?"

792
00:56:28,184 --> 00:56:30,494
"The crazy lovers!"

793
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:37,037
"O' when do they agree;
the crazy lovers."

794
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:41,164
"Even though God comes
to make them up!"

795
00:56:41,297 --> 00:56:47,248
"O' when do they agree;
the crazy lovers."

796
00:57:13,830 --> 00:57:21,442
"O' I have given you my
heart and my consent."

797
00:57:21,838 --> 00:57:28,551
"O' in spite of losing my heart;
I have given you love."

798
00:57:28,645 --> 00:57:36,723
"O' I have given you my
heart and my consent."

799
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:42,497
"O' in spite of losing my heart;
I have given you love."

800
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:46,300
"So we are crazy about each other."

801
00:57:46,396 --> 00:57:50,208
"Then why should anyone
come to teach us?"

802
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:52,378
"We live lost in each other."

803
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:53,675
"Wherever we go!"

804
00:57:53,870 --> 00:57:59,616
"O' when do they agree;
the crazy lovers."

805
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:03,587
"Even though God comes
to make them up!"

806
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:09,631
"O' when do they agree;
the crazy lovers."

807
00:58:21,431 --> 00:58:29,350
"O' your open hair makes
me desperate."

808
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:37,186
"Your lashes arouse the
feelings of my heart."

809
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:44,898
"O' your open hair makes
me desperate."

810
00:58:45,255 --> 00:58:50,329
"Your lashes arouse the
feelings of my heart."

811
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:54,306
"Your loving gestures impress me."

812
00:58:54,464 --> 00:58:57,968
"Your love has brought such
a colourful effect."

813
00:58:58,334 --> 00:59:01,611
"Just look I am feeling so elated."

814
00:59:01,771 --> 00:59:06,720
"O' when do they agree;
the crazy lovers."

815
00:59:06,809 --> 00:59:12,987
"O' when do they agree;
the crazy lovers."

816
00:59:13,416 --> 00:59:17,262
"Even though God comes
to make them up!"

817
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:22,393
"O' when do they agree;
the crazy lovers."

818
00:59:22,492 --> 00:59:28,841
"O' when do they agree;
the crazy lovers."

819
00:59:59,895 --> 01:00:00,965
Gardener!

820
01:00:11,874 --> 01:00:13,319
One week has passed since
we arrived here.

821
01:00:13,475 --> 01:00:15,386
But it seems we have arrived
here yesterday.

822
01:00:17,212 --> 01:00:22,719
Hey! I feel like eating
with these hands so much.

823
01:00:24,586 --> 01:00:26,088
You spare time sometime.

824
01:00:27,923 --> 01:00:28,924
Let my posting be done.

825
01:00:29,058 --> 01:00:30,128
Then I have a lot of free time.

826
01:00:42,638 --> 01:00:46,142
I think; far from Mumbai.

827
01:00:47,276 --> 01:00:48,880
I should work at some such hospital.

828
01:00:49,845 --> 01:00:50,915
Where everything is..

829
01:00:55,317 --> 01:00:56,421
Why far off?

830
01:00:57,252 --> 01:00:58,492
Are you telling because of mummy?

831
01:00:58,620 --> 01:01:01,726
Mummy? What are you saying?

832
01:01:02,057 --> 01:01:03,730
You bring mummy in every thing.

833
01:01:04,993 --> 01:01:06,165
Just like that!

834
01:01:32,454 --> 01:01:33,524
Hey just listen..

835
01:01:35,824 --> 01:01:36,894
'Where has she gone?'

836
01:01:37,626 --> 01:01:40,698
Santosh! Hey butter toast!

837
01:01:43,832 --> 01:01:44,936
What happened?

838
01:01:48,437 --> 01:01:50,417
Do you think I said anything
regarding your mummy?

839
01:01:50,539 --> 01:01:51,609
Yes?

840
01:01:54,276 --> 01:01:55,380
You are feeling all right,
aren't you?

841
01:01:57,412 --> 01:01:58,482
What's this?

842
01:02:00,315 --> 01:02:02,522
Oh! I have understood.

843
01:02:03,285 --> 01:02:05,925
You have recollected you
childhood boyfriend. Yes?

844
01:02:10,259 --> 01:02:11,567
Tell me the truth.
- What's the matter?

845
01:02:12,861 --> 01:02:13,931
Yes?

846
01:02:14,563 --> 01:02:17,134
When I can feed morsels to you.

847
01:02:18,467 --> 01:02:20,879
Do you get that in your hands
by putting in my mouth?

848
01:02:22,004 --> 01:02:23,210
We are married yesterday.

849
01:02:23,372 --> 01:02:24,680
And today the situation is this!

850
01:02:27,876 --> 01:02:29,150
You got angry over
such a small thing?

851
01:02:29,244 --> 01:02:30,484
It must be a small thing for you.

852
01:02:32,014 --> 01:02:33,550
And then from the time we came here.

853
01:02:33,815 --> 01:02:37,820
You didn't call me a
sweeper even once.

854
01:02:37,986 --> 01:02:41,263
Yes sweeper! I have definitely
committed this mistake.

855
01:02:43,458 --> 01:02:45,495
Please forgive me. Hey!

856
01:02:49,932 --> 01:02:51,570
Shall I ask you one thing?
- Ask.

857
01:02:54,503 --> 01:02:56,847
You will not leave me and go away.

858
01:02:59,274 --> 01:03:03,518
Toshi! You are a real darling!

859
01:03:05,447 --> 01:03:07,188
I will..
- Hey!

860
01:03:17,859 --> 01:03:18,929
Ouch!

861
01:03:19,561 --> 01:03:20,665
What happened?

862
01:04:00,402 --> 01:04:01,506
Mother!

863
01:04:02,537 --> 01:04:06,610
"When the evening arrives."

864
01:04:07,142 --> 01:04:10,385
"My heart becomes sad."

865
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:15,092
"Where should I go?"

866
01:04:15,651 --> 01:04:19,258
"What should I do?"

867
01:04:20,022 --> 01:04:24,300
"When the evening arrives."

868
01:04:24,559 --> 01:04:28,097
"My heart becomes sad."

869
01:04:28,997 --> 01:04:32,809
"Where should I go?"

870
01:04:33,302 --> 01:04:36,806
"What should I do?"

871
01:04:37,606 --> 01:04:42,988
"When the evening arrives."

872
01:04:55,057 --> 01:04:58,698
"Who is my dear one?"

873
01:04:59,027 --> 01:05:07,105
"Whom should I call?"

874
01:05:08,170 --> 01:05:11,617
"I am sitting alone."

875
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:16,648
"I look at the birds."

876
01:05:16,878 --> 01:05:20,257
"I look at the birds."

877
01:05:21,383 --> 01:05:25,331
"Even the birds go away."

878
01:05:25,654 --> 01:05:29,067
"Everyone returned back."

879
01:05:30,192 --> 01:05:33,867
"Only you didn't return back."

880
01:05:34,529 --> 01:05:37,976
"What should I do?"

881
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:44,580
"When the evening arrives."

882
01:06:06,528 --> 01:06:14,709
"My every night; it is the
night of isolation."

883
01:06:15,137 --> 01:06:18,209
"It is a lonely night."

884
01:06:19,474 --> 01:06:22,978
"What is the heart; they
don't know this."

885
01:06:23,645 --> 01:06:27,855
"These two eyes of mine."

886
01:06:28,049 --> 01:06:31,258
"These two eyes of mine."

887
01:06:32,421 --> 01:06:40,238
"One night passes and
other night arrives."

888
01:06:41,263 --> 01:06:45,143
"You only tell me."

889
01:06:45,534 --> 01:06:49,175
"What should I do?"

890
01:06:49,905 --> 01:06:54,047
"When the evening arrives."

891
01:06:54,409 --> 01:06:57,822
"My heart becomes sad."

892
01:06:58,447 --> 01:07:02,486
"Where should I go?"

893
01:07:02,984 --> 01:07:06,431
"What should I do?"

894
01:07:07,255 --> 01:07:13,262
"When the evening arrives."

895
01:07:13,528 --> 01:07:17,340
Ahaa! No one is happier than
us in this world. - Oh!

896
01:07:30,979 --> 01:07:32,049
Greetings, mother.

897
01:07:32,214 --> 01:07:34,319
Live long! How are you, Jiyaram?

898
01:07:35,817 --> 01:07:36,887
Suman! Mummy!

899
01:07:41,590 --> 01:07:42,796
Oh mummy!

900
01:07:43,391 --> 01:07:44,870
Why didn't you tell before?

901
01:07:47,796 --> 01:07:48,900
Greetings, mother.

902
01:07:49,397 --> 01:07:50,501
Forgive me, dear.

903
01:07:51,132 --> 01:07:53,476
I.. it's such a big house.

904
01:07:53,568 --> 01:07:55,309
I was not able to live there alone.

905
01:07:56,238 --> 01:07:57,342
You don't worry.

906
01:07:57,439 --> 01:07:58,611
I will serve you.

907
01:07:58,974 --> 01:08:01,454
I.. I will not come your way.

908
01:08:01,610 --> 01:08:03,180
Mummy won't come in our way.

909
01:08:04,212 --> 01:08:05,953
What are you talking, mother?

910
01:08:06,248 --> 01:08:07,454
Such a big bungalow..

911
01:08:07,582 --> 01:08:09,584
Yes, such a big bungalow
and no place for you?

912
01:08:09,851 --> 01:08:11,694
You were alone there.
- Its better you came here.

913
01:08:11,853 --> 01:08:12,991
She did the right thing, didn't she?

914
01:08:13,455 --> 01:08:14,866
Yes! She has done the right thing.

915
01:08:15,857 --> 01:08:17,700
Come on! Jiyaram, bring the luggage.

916
01:08:17,826 --> 01:08:18,896
Hurry UP!

917
01:08:31,940 --> 01:08:33,419
'Move aside from here.'
- 'What are you doing?'

918
01:08:35,577 --> 01:08:37,784
'Oh, oh!
- All right. That's it!'

919
01:08:37,946 --> 01:08:39,619
'Is it done this way?
- Fine? Happy?'

920
01:08:39,948 --> 01:08:42,428
'Happy? I'll give you a tight
slap.' - 'Don't you feel ashamed?'

921
01:08:42,551 --> 01:08:43,621
'Behave yourself.'

922
01:08:43,785 --> 01:08:44,855
'Let me do it.'

923
01:08:46,087 --> 01:08:47,191
Santosh!

924
01:08:54,596 --> 01:08:58,203
'Hey, no. It's okay.
Okay! Your turn.'

925
01:08:58,333 --> 01:08:59,403
'Do whatever you want.'

926
01:08:59,534 --> 01:09:00,808
'Okay?
- Yes.'

927
01:09:00,902 --> 01:09:01,972
'Come here.'

928
01:09:49,484 --> 01:09:57,995
"O my beloved, he has
become heartless."

929
01:09:58,493 --> 01:10:02,566
"Someone go and make him up."

930
01:10:02,697 --> 01:10:06,338
"O my beloved"

931
01:10:44,339 --> 01:10:46,410
Jiyaram, your sir is
going to wake up now.

932
01:10:46,541 --> 01:10:48,282
Go and warm up water for his bath.

933
01:10:48,410 --> 01:10:49,650
All right. Take this.
- You give this to me.

934
01:10:49,844 --> 01:10:50,914
Keep this over there.

935
01:11:00,455 --> 01:11:01,729
Get up, I am feeling very hungry.

936
01:11:13,535 --> 01:11:14,605
Get up!

937
01:11:16,871 --> 01:11:19,215
Hey, get up, I am feeling
very hungry.

938
01:11:21,476 --> 01:11:22,546
I am feeling sleepy.

939
01:11:35,423 --> 01:11:36,493
Toshi!

940
01:11:39,461 --> 01:11:41,839
Oh! My hands are paining.

941
01:11:47,836 --> 01:11:49,941
No!
Hey go

942
01:12:07,856 --> 01:12:08,926
It's mummy!

943
01:12:10,892 --> 01:12:12,872
Greetings, dear.
- Greetings, mother.

944
01:12:13,294 --> 01:12:15,001
You were telling you were
feeling hungry. Take this.

945
01:12:15,363 --> 01:12:17,570
You.. why did you take the trouble?

946
01:12:17,665 --> 01:12:19,975
Yes, mummy. Why do you work so much?

947
01:12:20,268 --> 01:12:21,406
What are you telling, dear?

948
01:12:21,936 --> 01:12:23,279
Do I have anyone else in this world?

949
01:12:23,438 --> 01:12:24,508
For whom I can do something.

950
01:12:24,639 --> 01:12:25,709
Yes? Eat it.

951
01:12:25,907 --> 01:12:28,080
Hey? The fork and knife? Jiyaram!

952
01:12:29,811 --> 01:12:30,881
Jiyaram!

953
01:12:34,549 --> 01:12:37,928
How did mother come to know
that I am feeling hungry?

954
01:12:39,454 --> 01:12:41,695
This means she roams
nearby only. Yes?

955
01:12:44,359 --> 01:12:46,100
We don't even have our
bedroom privacy?

956
01:12:48,029 --> 01:12:49,201
Don't blame mother.

957
01:12:49,998 --> 01:12:51,341
Mother is a very loving lady.

958
01:12:51,633 --> 01:12:53,340
She may be a sea of love.

959
01:12:53,501 --> 01:12:55,538
But I think I won't be
able to bear this love.

960
01:12:57,405 --> 01:13:01,581
Santosh, I don't why but
I fear a big danger.

961
01:13:02,043 --> 01:13:03,249
You are just like this!

962
01:13:03,645 --> 01:13:04,715
Toshi, why don't you understand?

963
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:06,918
I don't mother's love but your love!

964
01:13:07,882 --> 01:13:09,862
You cook and feed me.

965
01:13:10,285 --> 01:13:11,355
You wash and iron my clothes.

966
01:13:11,452 --> 01:13:12,522
You go for an outing with me.

967
01:13:12,654 --> 01:13:13,724
You..
- Okay darling, fine!

968
01:13:14,856 --> 01:13:15,926
Now eat this.

969
01:13:48,423 --> 01:13:51,563
Hey sweeper!
- What is it?

970
01:13:51,893 --> 01:13:54,271
There is no button on my shirt.

971
01:13:55,029 --> 01:13:56,702
I'll stitch it just now. Give me.

972
01:14:01,402 --> 01:14:02,472
I will sew the button, dear.

973
01:14:02,971 --> 01:14:04,041
You get ready.

974
01:14:04,239 --> 01:14:05,343
Mummy!

975
01:14:28,863 --> 01:14:33,312
Take it, dear.
- Hey? You are in such a hurry?

976
01:14:35,803 --> 01:14:36,907
Toshi!

977
01:14:40,441 --> 01:14:42,182
Mummy, you don't know
what you are doing?

978
01:14:44,279 --> 01:14:45,485
But what am I doing?

979
01:14:45,613 --> 01:14:47,422
You are making your daughter's
life miserable.

980
01:14:47,548 --> 01:14:49,050
He had told me to sew the button.

981
01:14:49,851 --> 01:14:51,455
So what happened if I sewed it?

982
01:14:51,586 --> 01:14:53,998
Oh, oh! Now how should I tell you?

983
01:14:55,123 --> 01:14:57,330
Your parents had ruined your
life with their motherhood.

984
01:14:59,227 --> 01:15:00,706
You are ruining your daughter's
life with your motherhood!

985
01:15:02,897 --> 01:15:09,542
Oh God! I thought that how much
sorrow my father gave him.

986
01:15:10,538 --> 01:15:12,848
I will give your husband
that much happiness!

987
01:15:14,342 --> 01:15:15,412
And I should show the world!

988
01:15:38,533 --> 01:15:45,610
Mother! Please forgive me.
- Santosh!

989
01:15:47,208 --> 01:15:48,812
Go! He is calling you.

990
01:15:49,210 --> 01:15:50,416
Let him call me.

991
01:15:51,012 --> 01:15:53,492
Until you won't forgive me.
- I will not go!

992
01:15:54,215 --> 01:15:55,285
Toshi!

993
01:15:55,416 --> 01:15:56,486
Go now.

994
01:15:56,617 --> 01:15:58,528
Go he is calling you.
- I beg in front of you.

995
01:15:58,820 --> 01:15:59,890
I plead in front of you.

996
01:16:00,054 --> 01:16:01,124
Go now.

997
01:16:09,831 --> 01:16:10,935
What happened?

998
01:16:11,499 --> 01:16:12,978
You don't know anything
about emotions.

999
01:16:13,901 --> 01:16:15,505
You may be a doctor of body.

1000
01:16:15,870 --> 01:16:17,042
But not of the heart.

1001
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:20,451
What is someone's feeling?

1002
01:16:21,242 --> 01:16:22,312
How do anyone feels?

1003
01:16:23,011 --> 01:16:24,115
You will never understand this.

1004
01:16:24,312 --> 01:16:25,916
Santosh, don't you dare!

1005
01:16:26,381 --> 01:16:27,724
Does anyone talks like
this with her husband?

1006
01:16:28,049 --> 01:16:29,494
Did I teach you this and sent you?

1007
01:16:30,218 --> 01:16:31,424
Now if you speak one more word.

1008
01:16:31,552 --> 01:16:32,997
Then I'll pull off your tongue!

1009
01:16:33,388 --> 01:16:35,425
Toshi is at no fault
in this, mother.

1010
01:16:35,590 --> 01:16:36,660
Then entire fault is mine!

1011
01:16:36,791 --> 01:16:38,464
No dear, she is the root cause.

1012
01:16:38,593 --> 01:16:41,335
Oh, oh! Now even you
are getting angry.

1013
01:16:41,462 --> 01:16:42,532
Oh yes, I just remembered!

1014
01:16:42,663 --> 01:16:44,336
Today there is a very good
programme at the theater.

1015
01:16:44,465 --> 01:16:45,944
Even you will have to accompany us.

1016
01:16:46,300 --> 01:16:48,075
No dear, I will not come.

1017
01:16:48,169 --> 01:16:49,239
You will not come?

1018
01:16:50,204 --> 01:16:52,013
If you will not come then
even I will not go.

1019
01:16:52,140 --> 01:16:53,210
I am sitting here.

1020
01:16:53,374 --> 01:16:55,183
Neither I'll go anywhere
nor eat anything.

1021
01:16:56,611 --> 01:16:59,057
Mother, he is requesting
you so lovingly.

1022
01:17:00,548 --> 01:17:03,085
No dear, don't kill me like this.

1023
01:17:04,519 --> 01:17:06,692
You just let me live.

1024
01:17:07,822 --> 01:17:09,426
You be in front of my eyes.

1025
01:17:09,957 --> 01:17:11,698
I don't want anything else.

1026
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:14,067
Mother! I don't want anything.

1027
01:17:14,162 --> 01:17:15,436
Mother!

1028
01:17:26,474 --> 01:17:28,385
Huh? What are you doing?

1029
01:17:28,476 --> 01:17:29,454
What? Hush!

1030
01:18:48,189 --> 01:18:50,829
Yes. Your..

1031
01:18:54,795 --> 01:18:55,899
What nonsense?

1032
01:18:56,264 --> 01:18:57,709
Why did you give it to her
when I have the token?

1033
01:18:58,499 --> 01:19:00,501
Didn't she come with you?

1034
01:19:00,801 --> 01:19:01,905
I thought that. .

1035
01:19:02,203 --> 01:19:03,307
Why did you understand this?

1036
01:19:03,404 --> 01:19:04,712
Without the token how
can you give the thing?

1037
01:19:04,972 --> 01:19:06,713
Sir, that is fine.
- It is wrong.

1038
01:19:06,908 --> 01:19:08,649
It's wrong! Wrong! Wrong
on principles.

1039
01:19:09,043 --> 01:19:10,545
Suman!
- Let it be, dear.

1040
01:19:12,446 --> 01:19:13,550
I am sorry, sir.

1041
01:19:13,848 --> 01:19:15,293
What the hell do you mean by sorry?

1042
01:19:15,449 --> 01:19:17,224
I'll see that you are
fired this very moment!

1043
01:19:17,318 --> 01:19:18,422
Where is the secretary
of this place?

1044
01:19:18,519 --> 01:19:19,623
Where is the secretary?

1045
01:19:20,288 --> 01:19:21,392
I say come.

1046
01:19:21,522 --> 01:19:23,695
It's hell! Hell, hell,
hell out of it!

1047
01:19:28,262 --> 01:19:29,832
At least you should have
thought about us.

1048
01:19:29,931 --> 01:19:31,308
You were not ready to
understand anything.

1049
01:19:31,399 --> 01:19:32,503
This is the limit!

1050
01:19:33,034 --> 01:19:34,240
I am talking about some principle!

1051
01:19:34,368 --> 01:19:35,438
Let it be, dear.

1052
01:19:35,570 --> 01:19:36,844
Even I am talking about
one principle.. - Toshi!

1053
01:19:37,238 --> 01:19:39,684
I can't bear someone's interference
in everything.

1054
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:42,411
And I will not bear considering
every good thing as wrong.

1055
01:19:43,010 --> 01:19:44,921
Between us; forget human beings.

1056
01:19:45,046 --> 01:19:46,184
I will not even allow
God to come between us.

1057
01:19:46,280 --> 01:19:48,487
Oh, oh! Is there any God
greater than a human?

1058
01:19:48,616 --> 01:19:50,220
There is! Your mother!

1059
01:19:50,451 --> 01:19:52,021
She is not your mother but
a rival lady! - Shut up!

1060
01:19:53,054 --> 01:19:54,533
Don't dare to say anything
to my mother.

1061
01:19:54,655 --> 01:19:56,328
I will say. I will
say several times.

1062
01:19:58,492 --> 01:20:00,096
I had told you before marriage.

1063
01:20:00,194 --> 01:20:01,298
That mother will live with us.

1064
01:20:01,462 --> 01:20:02,941
I understood as soon
as I got married.

1065
01:20:03,030 --> 01:20:04,134
That what wrong thing I have done!

1066
01:20:04,432 --> 01:20:06,139
We can't manage even for two days.

1067
01:20:06,267 --> 01:20:08,770
You don't need
a husband but a mother!

1068
01:20:26,687 --> 01:20:30,225
I say sir, it the mad
ones laugh very nicely.

1069
01:20:30,691 --> 01:20:32,500
The society people cry. They weep!

1070
01:20:35,129 --> 01:20:37,700
What happened?
- Nothing.

1071
01:20:40,234 --> 01:20:41,338
If you ask the truth.

1072
01:20:41,435 --> 01:20:42,743
Then the ones who look mad.

1073
01:20:42,870 --> 01:20:43,974
They are not mad ones in reality.

1074
01:20:44,438 --> 01:20:46,975
And those who don't look mad they..

1075
01:20:48,242 --> 01:20:49,880
Chalu!
- Yes?

1076
01:20:52,647 --> 01:20:54,183
Who named you as Chalu?

1077
01:20:55,650 --> 01:20:57,652
My parents name was Bat-aalu!

1078
01:20:58,286 --> 01:20:59,356
Bataata-Aloo!

1079
01:21:00,254 --> 01:21:02,200
And they named their love as Chalu!

1080
01:21:02,890 --> 01:21:04,096
Chalu!
- Yes, sir.

1081
01:21:04,292 --> 01:21:05,532
So you are the in charge here?
- Yes.

1082
01:21:05,660 --> 01:21:08,402
The big officer of the mad ones?
- Yes! No! Junior one!

1083
01:21:08,529 --> 01:21:09,633
You are the senior one!

1084
01:21:10,364 --> 01:21:11,775
I have heard you steal their money.

1085
01:21:11,866 --> 01:21:13,641
Yes! No! Look at this.

1086
01:21:14,335 --> 01:21:16,246
If someone gives with happiness.

1087
01:21:16,470 --> 01:21:17,574
Then I don't refuse.

1088
01:21:17,672 --> 01:21:19,709
Hey? What? What does this contains?

1089
01:21:19,874 --> 01:21:21,080
Sweets!
- Sweets?

1090
01:21:21,509 --> 01:21:23,921
Sweets! Go eat it; enjoy yourself!

1091
01:21:25,079 --> 01:21:27,753
Keep it inside, sir.

1092
01:21:32,253 --> 01:21:35,700
Doctor, there is a
cat in my stomach.

1093
01:21:41,228 --> 01:21:42,298
What are you doing?

1094
01:21:42,596 --> 01:21:45,406
I am feeding milk
to the cat, doctor.

1095
01:21:45,533 --> 01:21:47,012
Just look, she is shaking.

1096
01:21:57,011 --> 01:21:59,218
Hey, have you seen Hyderabad?

1097
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:01,726
<i>Yes, 1 have seen. - Have you
seen the Kutub Miner there?</i>

1098
01:22:01,882 --> 01:22:04,658
Kutub Minar? Kutub
Minar is at Delhi!

1099
01:22:05,052 --> 01:22:06,690
The Char Minar is present
at Hyderabad.

1100
01:22:07,021 --> 01:22:10,127
Oh, oh! At least it's
a Minar! Go to sleep!

1101
01:22:13,861 --> 01:22:15,272
Have you passed B.A.?

1102
01:22:15,496 --> 01:22:17,407
Not B.A. but I have passed metric.

1103
01:22:17,531 --> 01:22:19,272
Oh, oh! At least you have passed it.

1104
01:22:19,867 --> 01:22:20,971
Go to sleep.

1105
01:22:23,037 --> 01:22:27,110
Sir! Have you passed
the doctor's degree?

1106
01:22:28,576 --> 01:22:29,577
Shall I go to sleep?

1107
01:22:34,615 --> 01:22:37,459
Cobra! Cobra! Doctor, a cobra!

1108
01:22:40,221 --> 01:22:41,291
Where is the cobra?

1109
01:22:41,422 --> 01:22:42,696
Doctor, a cobra! Here it is!

1110
01:22:42,857 --> 01:22:45,463
Let him enter the hole, doctor.
Let him enter the hole.

1111
01:22:45,559 --> 01:22:48,130
He will bite me. He'll kill me,
doctor. He'll kill me.

1112
01:22:52,833 --> 01:22:54,972
Madhavi! Madhavi! Madhavi!
- Hey?

1113
01:23:03,177 --> 01:23:05,487
Chalu, it's the Superintendent
sir's order.

1114
01:23:05,646 --> 01:23:06,989
The patients should be
taken for an outing.

1115
01:23:07,114 --> 01:23:08,491
Outing?
- Give me this board.

1116
01:23:08,916 --> 01:23:10,088
You go and gather everyone.

1117
01:23:15,556 --> 01:23:17,092
Come on! Let's go for an outing!

1118
01:24:28,362 --> 01:24:29,500
Driver, stop the bus.

1119
01:24:31,198 --> 01:24:33,974
Chalu, come out. Come out.

1120
01:24:36,170 --> 01:24:37,410
Yes Chalu!
- Yes, sir?

1121
01:24:37,538 --> 01:24:39,176
I have some work here.
- Yes, sir.

1122
01:24:39,306 --> 01:24:41,343
You count all these patients and
take them carefully. - Yes, sir.

1123
01:24:41,442 --> 01:24:43,683
And listen, don't count yourself.

1124
01:24:44,845 --> 01:24:46,256
Otherwise one mad patient
will be reduced.

1125
01:24:46,447 --> 01:24:48,484
One minute! Two! Two! Even
you are going, aren't you?

1126
01:24:49,617 --> 01:24:51,062
But there will be only
one while counting.

1127
01:25:05,499 --> 01:25:07,410
This is fine! It's matching
blouse piece?

1128
01:25:07,601 --> 01:25:10,548
I'll match it with it and send it
to the hospital with the boy.

1129
01:25:10,638 --> 01:25:12,208
All right. Okay.

1130
01:25:12,339 --> 01:25:13,409
Most welcome!

1131
01:25:20,848 --> 01:25:23,852
"My tresses are tangled."

1132
01:25:25,019 --> 01:25:32,335
"Untangle them, O beloved."

1133
01:25:33,594 --> 01:25:42,446
"Henna is adorned in my hands."

1134
01:25:44,238 --> 01:25:46,946
"My tresses are tangled."

1135
01:25:48,108 --> 01:25:56,118
"Untangle them, O beloved."

1136
01:26:15,302 --> 01:26:17,543
It's mother! She saw
both of us together.

1137
01:26:31,385 --> 01:26:35,026
It seems I have come to another
asylum from on asylum.

1138
01:26:48,268 --> 01:26:50,714
Doctor, I had kept my keys here.

1139
01:26:51,572 --> 01:26:52,642
Where are my keys?

1140
01:26:56,810 --> 01:26:57,880
They are not here.

1141
01:26:58,412 --> 01:27:00,619
Oh! Then they must have fallen down.

1142
01:27:03,917 --> 01:27:05,919
Did you kept them here only?
- Yes, yes, doctor.

1143
01:27:10,090 --> 01:27:11,160
They are not here.

1144
01:27:11,625 --> 01:27:13,434
Doctor, then they must be up there.

1145
01:27:18,999 --> 01:27:21,036
Hey doctor, he is mad!

1146
01:27:23,270 --> 01:27:24,374
You go out.

1147
01:27:24,872 --> 01:27:26,283
What should I do by
going out, doctor?

1148
01:27:26,373 --> 01:27:27,443
My keys are not found.

1149
01:27:27,841 --> 01:27:28,842
You go out.

1150
01:27:28,976 --> 01:27:30,922
Doctor! Brother doctor,
my keys are not found!

1151
01:27:31,011 --> 01:27:32,115
Get out from here. No.

1152
01:27:32,212 --> 01:27:34,920
Doctor! Doctor, my
keys are not found.

1153
01:27:35,015 --> 01:27:36,085
Doctor, my keys are not found.

1154
01:27:36,216 --> 01:27:37,286
Get out from here.
- Doctor! Doctor!

1155
01:27:38,185 --> 01:27:40,791
Sir, the senior officer
has sent you greetings.

1156
01:27:41,388 --> 01:27:43,095
All right. Give my regards
to him also.

1157
01:27:43,290 --> 01:27:44,496
Hey no! What are you talking?

1158
01:27:45,192 --> 01:27:46,262
How can I give him your greetings?

1159
01:27:46,393 --> 01:27:47,463
Why?

1160
01:27:47,594 --> 01:27:50,598
Oh! You are new here now.
- So?

1161
01:27:50,964 --> 01:27:52,136
By greetings it means
he has called you.

1162
01:27:52,299 --> 01:27:53,471
So say this.

1163
01:27:55,202 --> 01:27:56,306
Sir!
_ Yes?

1164
01:27:58,205 --> 01:28:00,116
Please tell something about
me to the senior officer.

1165
01:28:01,008 --> 01:28:03,079
I am a poor man.
- I have wife and kids.

1166
01:28:03,243 --> 01:28:04,654
I have nine kids. Nine!

1167
01:28:04,812 --> 01:28:05,882
You have nine kids!?

1168
01:28:06,013 --> 01:28:09,051
Yes! Eight girls and four boys.

1169
01:28:09,216 --> 01:28:10,286
That is twelve!

1170
01:28:10,417 --> 01:28:13,694
No! Nine! Two are no more.
One is here.

1171
01:28:14,021 --> 01:28:15,193
And one is going to arrive.

1172
01:28:16,623 --> 01:28:18,102
How many years of your
marriage have passed?

1173
01:28:18,959 --> 01:28:20,267
13! 13 years!

1174
01:28:20,461 --> 01:28:23,931
13 years and 12 kids!
- Yes.

1175
01:28:25,899 --> 01:28:27,003
Chalu!
- Yes?

1176
01:28:27,901 --> 01:28:28,902
You change your name.

1177
01:28:30,170 --> 01:28:31,274
Sir!
_ Yes?

1178
01:28:32,106 --> 01:28:33,915
Sir, it's not my fault in this
but the government's fault!

1179
01:28:34,274 --> 01:28:35,912
The government has started
the family planning now.

1180
01:28:43,984 --> 01:28:45,054
May I come in, sir?

1181
01:28:45,185 --> 01:28:46,255
Yes, come in.

1182
01:28:49,790 --> 01:28:50,860
Good afternoon, sir.

1183
01:28:52,793 --> 01:28:53,863
Good afternoon.

1184
01:28:54,595 --> 01:28:55,665
Have a seat, doctor. Have a seat.

1185
01:28:58,198 --> 01:28:59,302
Sit! Sit!

1186
01:29:00,801 --> 01:29:01,905
Thank you, doctor.

1187
01:29:03,837 --> 01:29:05,942
So you have settled nicely?
- Yes, doctor.

1188
01:29:06,974 --> 01:29:09,386
Something seems to be missing!

1189
01:29:10,244 --> 01:29:11,348
Not at all!

1190
01:29:11,545 --> 01:29:13,252
Then you are a young man.

1191
01:29:13,413 --> 01:29:14,483
From the time you have arrived.

1192
01:29:14,615 --> 01:29:15,685
I didn't see a smile on your face.

1193
01:29:17,818 --> 01:29:20,697
To always keep on smiling
is sir, that..

1194
01:29:22,055 --> 01:29:24,160
Oh yes! I understood! I understood!

1195
01:29:24,424 --> 01:29:25,869
That's why I keep on laughing.

1196
01:29:26,260 --> 01:29:30,436
Young man, until one doesn't
expresses craziness of living.

1197
01:29:30,631 --> 01:29:33,407
Then it is difficult to survive
in this beautiful world of Allah!

1198
01:29:33,834 --> 01:29:34,938
Right?

1199
01:29:35,235 --> 01:29:37,272
But you are one your place!

1200
01:29:37,437 --> 01:29:38,973
Keep on disturbing
the other mad ones.

1201
01:29:39,439 --> 01:29:40,543
I am sorry, sir.

1202
01:29:41,041 --> 01:29:42,714
By the way, I tolerate everything.

1203
01:29:42,876 --> 01:29:44,685
But sometimes the matter
crosses the limit.

1204
01:29:45,245 --> 01:29:46,315
But why?

1205
01:29:46,580 --> 01:29:49,254
I ask you who is such
a man in this world.

1206
01:29:49,449 --> 01:29:51,952
The one who doesn't have
any problem with someone.

1207
01:29:52,486 --> 01:29:54,727
Even you be having some problem!
- Yes, doctor.

1208
01:30:00,460 --> 01:30:02,940
The matter is such there
is one lady at my house.

1209
01:30:03,530 --> 01:30:05,635
Because of her I am upset all
the time.. - Who? Who is she?

1210
01:30:06,466 --> 01:30:07,570
My mother-in-law!

1211
01:30:07,734 --> 01:30:11,272
Oh! The matter of mother-in-laws
is such!

1212
01:30:11,438 --> 01:30:12,883
Just think! What not
a female undergoes!..

1213
01:30:12,973 --> 01:30:15,453
...While becoming a mother-in-law
from a daughter-in-law!

1214
01:30:16,677 --> 01:30:18,748
If mother-in-law is present then
only you get a wife. Right?

1215
01:30:18,946 --> 01:30:20,050
Actually the matter is such.

1216
01:30:20,147 --> 01:30:21,649
That lady has made
my life miserable!

1217
01:30:22,549 --> 01:30:25,189
She has brought up her
daughter in such a way.

1218
01:30:25,352 --> 01:30:26,524
As if she doesn't has any intention!

1219
01:30:26,687 --> 01:30:28,189
As if she is a living dead body.

1220
01:30:28,488 --> 01:30:29,558
Whatever the male says;
she does only that!

1221
01:30:30,290 --> 01:30:31,360
It is possible.

1222
01:30:31,491 --> 01:30:35,439
That your mother-in-law has
some fear regarding males.

1223
01:30:36,897 --> 01:30:40,003
Yes, sir. She was the daughter
of some very rich man.

1224
01:30:40,367 --> 01:30:41,937
But she married one poor writer.

1225
01:30:42,236 --> 01:30:45,183
You are not only the son-in-law
of that house; but mine also!

1226
01:30:46,573 --> 01:30:48,177
After your father-in-law went away.

1227
01:30:48,275 --> 01:30:49,379
I searched a lot for him.

1228
01:30:52,279 --> 01:30:53,587
You see those magazines, don't you?

1229
01:30:54,514 --> 01:30:57,552
Gopal left Mumbai and
went to Ilahbad.

1230
01:30:58,285 --> 01:31:00,094
And there he published one edition.

1231
01:31:01,255 --> 01:31:04,202
First he used to write on the
name of Santosh and then Vivek.

1232
01:31:05,659 --> 01:31:07,866
He became very famous
as a writer very soon.

1233
01:31:09,263 --> 01:31:13,006
His writing style disturbed Shanta.

1234
01:31:13,367 --> 01:31:15,040
And Shanta recognised him.

1235
01:31:16,870 --> 01:31:20,613
Then I, Shanta and Damle;
we three reached Ilahbad.

1236
01:31:22,009 --> 01:31:24,489
But before we reached there;
Gopal came to know.

1237
01:31:25,512 --> 01:31:26,923
And he left Ilahbad and went away.

1238
01:31:28,916 --> 01:31:31,294
From that day till now;
I am searching for him.

1239
01:31:34,021 --> 01:31:35,432
You come to our house, doctor.

1240
01:31:36,323 --> 01:31:38,269
My mother-in-law will be
very happy to meet you.

1241
01:31:38,425 --> 01:31:42,532
Hey, no, no, dear! How
can I confront Shanta?

1242
01:31:43,430 --> 01:31:44,966
I had promised here.

1243
01:31:46,133 --> 01:31:49,740
That dear, one day I'll
bring your husband.

1244
01:31:51,371 --> 01:31:52,645
If she'll see me.

1245
01:31:54,041 --> 01:31:56,317
Then she'll recollect her
past sorrows once more.

1246
01:32:06,853 --> 01:32:07,923
He has arrived.

1247
01:32:14,928 --> 01:32:16,874
Oh flowers! I like
flowers very much!

1248
01:32:17,597 --> 01:32:20,271
Come on; give them to me. I will..
Hey no! They are not for you.

1249
01:32:20,667 --> 01:32:22,271
I have brought them for
mother's veneration.

1250
01:32:22,469 --> 01:32:24,779
She will worship the statue
and I'll worship her.

1251
01:32:25,272 --> 01:32:28,082
You!? Oh! So surprising!

1252
01:32:29,476 --> 01:32:30,614
Oh! Ask for anything!

1253
01:32:30,677 --> 01:32:32,281
What will I get if I ask? Yes?

1254
01:32:32,612 --> 01:32:33,886
If you ask then you get nothing!

1255
01:32:34,047 --> 01:32:35,424
Okay darling, don't ask.

1256
01:32:36,516 --> 01:32:37,620
Let it be!

1257
01:32:42,289 --> 01:32:44,895
'Shanta, you love me very much!'

1258
01:32:48,295 --> 01:32:50,639
'Oh God! What was I imagining?'

1259
01:32:52,632 --> 01:32:53,736
'I am a great sinner!'

1260
01:32:54,501 --> 01:32:56,412
'I'll be a sinner if
I offer his flowers.'

1261
01:32:57,337 --> 01:32:58,407
'Oh God!'

1262
01:33:03,910 --> 01:33:06,288
Just look how lovingly your
house is decorated!

1263
01:33:06,646 --> 01:33:07,716
My house?

1264
01:33:07,848 --> 01:33:09,850
Oh, oh! Are our houses
different ones?

1265
01:33:10,650 --> 01:33:15,650
"I don't have anyone besides
you, Girdhar Gopal!"

1266
01:33:25,132 --> 01:33:33,608
"I don't have anyone besides
you, Girdhar Gopal!"

1267
01:33:34,307 --> 01:33:39,307
"I don't have anyone,
Girdhar Gopal."

1268
01:33:55,128 --> 01:34:03,343
"Your divine and majestic face."

1269
01:34:03,637 --> 01:34:07,744
"I am totally impressed by you."

1270
01:34:08,175 --> 01:34:11,850
"In all the three worlds."
"There is no one like you."

1271
01:34:12,045 --> 01:34:16,323
"I don't have anyone,
Girdhar Gopal."

1272
01:34:30,497 --> 01:34:34,809
"With great difficulty
I tried and tried."

1273
01:34:34,901 --> 01:34:38,815
"And started the saga of love."

1274
01:34:39,506 --> 01:34:42,817
"With great difficulty
I tried and tried."

1275
01:34:42,876 --> 01:34:46,881
"And started the saga of love."

1276
01:34:47,380 --> 01:34:55,424
"Now the love has spread
and reached its height."

1277
01:34:55,489 --> 01:34:59,665
"I don't have anyone,
Girdhar Gopal."

1278
01:35:12,005 --> 01:35:16,181
"Your devotee is crazy after you."

1279
01:35:16,576 --> 01:35:20,456
"She is weeping amidst the world."

1280
01:35:28,855 --> 01:35:32,928
"Your devotee is crazy after you."

1281
01:35:33,326 --> 01:35:36,899
"She is weeping amidst the world."

1282
01:35:37,297 --> 01:35:40,540
"Your maid.."

1283
01:35:43,603 --> 01:35:51,681
"Your maid is sitting at
your feet and weeping."

1284
01:35:52,212 --> 01:36:00,222
"I don't have anyone besides
you, Girdhar Gopal!"

1285
01:36:00,387 --> 01:36:06,030
"I don't have anyone, Girdhar
Gopal." "I don't have anyone."

1286
01:36:12,098 --> 01:36:13,168
Mother!

1287
01:36:15,235 --> 01:36:16,578
I don't want your flowers.

1288
01:36:17,237 --> 01:36:18,443
After all even I am a human being.

1289
01:36:18,538 --> 01:36:19,608
Even I have a life.

1290
01:36:19,673 --> 01:36:20,845
This is not possible that
for a lady I should..

1291
01:36:20,941 --> 01:36:22,249
Not a lady, your mother!

1292
01:36:23,510 --> 01:36:25,512
Doctor!
- Sit down.

1293
01:36:28,481 --> 01:36:30,586
Listen, I was searching for
Gopal from the beginning.

1294
01:36:31,184 --> 01:36:32,390
But during these days.

1295
01:36:32,452 --> 01:36:33,863
I have come to know something
else about him.

1296
01:36:35,188 --> 01:36:36,326
Do you see that painting?

1297
01:36:38,792 --> 01:36:39,896
That is mother-in-law's photograph!

1298
01:36:40,927 --> 01:36:42,099
This Chitrang?

1299
01:36:42,495 --> 01:36:44,600
This Chitrang is actually Gopal!

1300
01:36:44,965 --> 01:36:46,103
Your father-in-law!

1301
01:36:46,600 --> 01:36:48,705
He left Ilahbad and went to Pune.

1302
01:36:49,402 --> 01:36:52,349
And he presented himself
as a painter.

1303
01:36:53,607 --> 01:36:55,678
He earned a lot of money.

1304
01:36:56,276 --> 01:36:57,880
He purchased one house also.

1305
01:36:59,813 --> 01:37:01,383
One evening he returned back home.

1306
01:37:02,148 --> 01:37:04,628
That time the folks
were burning Holi.

1307
01:37:05,685 --> 01:37:08,325
On one side the ladies were
offering veneration.

1308
01:37:09,456 --> 01:37:10,526
On the other hand.

1309
01:37:11,057 --> 01:37:12,832
The people were filtering
the intoxicating drink.

1310
01:37:12,892 --> 01:37:15,338
And singing and dancing.

1311
01:37:18,431 --> 01:37:22,846
Hey, so brother Ramraj, you are
celebrating Holi in a grand way!

1312
01:37:22,936 --> 01:37:28,045
No sir, today the Holi will
be burned! - I see!

1313
01:37:28,141 --> 01:37:29,950
Holi will be played tomorrow.

1314
01:37:30,010 --> 01:37:33,583
I see! I see! Come Mr. Gopal, the
intoxicating drink is drunk by all!

1315
01:37:33,647 --> 01:37:34,853
Even you drink one glass.

1316
01:37:34,948 --> 01:37:37,258
Hey no brother, I don't drink
the intoxicating drink.

1317
01:37:37,350 --> 01:37:39,660
Sometimes I drink liquor.

1318
01:37:39,786 --> 01:37:40,856
Good bye!
- Good bye!

1319
01:37:40,954 --> 01:37:42,024
Good bye!
- Good bye!

1320
01:37:42,088 --> 01:37:44,398
Talking lovingly with the people.

1321
01:37:44,591 --> 01:37:47,333
Gopal entered the courtyard
of his house.

1322
01:37:47,894 --> 01:37:52,138
And he saw one flower in his
garden was facing him.

1323
01:37:53,133 --> 01:37:55,477
He came inside. Then he saw
Shanta's photo in front.

1324
01:37:56,136 --> 01:37:57,547
The one which himself had painted.

1325
01:37:58,305 --> 01:38:00,410
He stopped in front
of her for a moment.

1326
01:38:00,974 --> 01:38:02,612
And he started murmuring to himself.

1327
01:38:03,143 --> 01:38:04,816
'I am coming, my darling!'

1328
01:38:05,045 --> 01:38:06,149
'I am coming!'

1329
01:38:07,547 --> 01:38:10,619
And sometimes even one small
thing disturbs someone.

1330
01:38:11,484 --> 01:38:13,293
Gopal had only one desire.

1331
01:38:13,620 --> 01:38:17,432
That he'll make his wife
wear the costliest sari.

1332
01:38:17,524 --> 01:38:19,697
And he will drench her with colours.

1333
01:38:20,126 --> 01:38:23,232
And no brave man will
be able to stop him.

1334
01:38:25,332 --> 01:38:27,039
Whatever income he used to get.

1335
01:38:27,634 --> 01:38:29,409
He used to purchase saris with that.

1336
01:38:30,337 --> 01:38:31,509
And within some time.

1337
01:38:31,571 --> 01:38:33,881
His house became a
wardrobe of saris.

1338
01:38:34,941 --> 01:38:37,649
Some saris were Banarasi
and some were Kanjiwaram.

1339
01:38:37,977 --> 01:38:40,184
Some Chanderi, and some Venkatwaram.

1340
01:38:40,847 --> 01:38:45,193
And then Bandhani, Lehriya,
chiffon and many more.

1341
01:38:46,052 --> 01:38:50,660
His entire world was that
house and those saris!

1342
01:39:18,818 --> 01:39:22,630
That day Gopal purchased the most
expensive sari of his life!

1343
01:39:23,890 --> 01:39:26,461
And even a doll with that.

1344
01:39:30,964 --> 01:39:33,342
'My dolly! My daughter!'

1345
01:39:39,139 --> 01:39:41,949
'Oh, oh! Papa, your beard hurts me.'

1346
01:39:45,645 --> 01:39:46,715
'So your beard hurts you?'

1347
01:39:48,448 --> 01:39:49,518
'So you have arrived, master.'

1348
01:39:49,849 --> 01:39:50,919
'Shall I serve the food?'

1349
01:39:51,451 --> 01:39:54,455
'No Chhotu, I am not feeling
hungry today.'

1350
01:39:54,654 --> 01:39:55,724
'Why will you feel hungry?'

1351
01:39:56,089 --> 01:39:57,295
'Tomorrow you have to go
to Mumbai, don't you?'

1352
01:39:57,657 --> 01:39:59,159
'You have to make up your
unhappy relatives.'

1353
01:40:00,059 --> 01:40:03,268
'Yes Chhotu, I have to make
up the angry ones.'

1354
01:40:03,863 --> 01:40:06,969
'Look at this! I have brought
so superb sari today.'

1355
01:40:07,534 --> 01:40:09,377
'Wow! It's so beautiful, master.'

1356
01:40:10,036 --> 01:40:11,106
'And this doll?'

1357
01:40:12,272 --> 01:40:13,979
'This is for my daughter.'

1358
01:40:15,675 --> 01:40:17,746
'Now she must have become
4 years old.'

1359
01:40:19,679 --> 01:40:21,022
'Shall I keep these saris, master?'

1360
01:40:22,515 --> 01:40:25,894
'No Chhotu, I will get up and pack
them myself tomorrow morning.'

1361
01:40:26,686 --> 01:40:28,893
'You go and go to sleep.' 'All
right, master. Good night.'

1362
01:40:32,559 --> 01:40:33,902
Sometimes Gopal used to think.

1363
01:40:34,294 --> 01:40:35,967
That Shanta is very lovely!

1364
01:40:37,330 --> 01:40:38,536
Then he used to say, no, no.

1365
01:40:38,598 --> 01:40:39,906
His daughter is more darling to him.

1366
01:40:40,333 --> 01:40:41,744
The one whom he has not even seen.

1367
01:40:42,635 --> 01:40:43,739
But then he used to think.

1368
01:40:43,937 --> 01:40:46,975
No, no! Shanta is lovelier
than all the females.

1369
01:40:47,574 --> 01:40:49,110
Shanta and his daughter!

1370
01:40:49,442 --> 01:40:50,853
His daughter and Shanta!

1371
01:40:51,010 --> 01:40:54,856
He didn't knew that when he'll
go to them tomorrow.

1372
01:40:54,914 --> 01:40:56,450
Then whom will he embrace first?

1373
01:41:07,994 --> 01:41:10,372
He kept the sari under his
head and went to sleep.

1374
01:41:11,598 --> 01:41:14,772
For quite some time
he caressed the sari.

1375
01:41:15,368 --> 01:41:16,972
And somewhere far off!

1376
01:41:17,437 --> 01:41:19,417
Someone with incomplete dreams,
colours in hands.

1377
01:41:19,672 --> 01:41:22,949
And with tears of repent
in eyes was calling him!

1378
01:41:23,543 --> 01:41:25,614
And there was a commotion
of the folks outside.

1379
01:41:25,945 --> 01:41:27,288
And it was going on increasing.

1380
01:41:28,114 --> 01:41:30,219
Slowly-slowly their dance
became a commotion.

1381
01:41:30,817 --> 01:41:32,296
And then a havoc!

1382
01:41:34,621 --> 01:41:35,827
Some spark fired back.

1383
01:41:35,889 --> 01:41:38,130
And it reached the
saris in some time.

1384
01:41:39,125 --> 01:41:40,331
Gopal was sleeping.

1385
01:41:40,960 --> 01:41:44,737
While his destiny
was getting ruined!

1386
01:41:46,032 --> 01:41:48,137
Whether the sari is
Banarasi or Chanderi!

1387
01:41:48,835 --> 01:41:50,246
It is Lehriya or Bandhani!

1388
01:41:50,637 --> 01:41:52,639
Though it has the seven
colours of the rainbow.

1389
01:41:52,839 --> 01:41:55,911
But after burning; only
one colour is left out.

1390
01:41:56,843 --> 01:41:58,015
The colour of ashes!

1391
01:41:58,244 --> 01:42:01,282
When he woke up; then
his destiny was ruined!

1392
01:42:04,651 --> 01:42:07,359
No one should ever be unfortunate
like Gopal, my Allah!

1393
01:42:08,254 --> 01:42:11,258
He saw his own funeral pyre
burning in front of him!

1394
01:42:12,325 --> 01:42:15,169
Just as a devotee plucks the
flowers for veneration.

1395
01:42:15,862 --> 01:42:19,036
Like that Gopal picked up the
sari and doll from his pillow.

1396
01:42:21,134 --> 01:42:23,273
'Help! Come here! Extinguish
the fire!'

1397
01:42:23,670 --> 01:42:27,117
'Bring water! Extinguish the
fire!' 'Cool down the fire!'

1398
01:42:44,424 --> 01:42:46,062
First he came out of the house.

1399
01:42:46,526 --> 01:42:50,133
And then beyond understanding life.

1400
01:43:14,921 --> 01:43:18,733
After that where he went; there
is no news about that.

1401
01:43:24,163 --> 01:43:25,233
What's this, doctor?

1402
01:43:26,032 --> 01:43:28,911
This is the greatest day
of my life, doctor Suman.

1403
01:43:33,506 --> 01:43:38,421
To live life with some
aim is so beautiful!

1404
01:43:39,812 --> 01:43:41,951
I don't have any complains
with anyone.

1405
01:43:43,116 --> 01:43:45,221
As much love I gave
to the people, dear.

1406
01:43:45,451 --> 01:43:47,431
I have received much more than that.

1407
01:43:52,425 --> 01:43:53,699
Do you see art?

1408
01:43:55,828 --> 01:44:00,174
Towards this I bow out
of thankfulness!

1409
01:44:02,635 --> 01:44:05,241
The emotions are expressed
in my eyes.

1410
01:44:08,641 --> 01:44:10,177
I will not allow them to go waste.

1411
01:44:11,010 --> 01:44:12,182
I will not let them go waste.

1412
01:44:14,914 --> 01:44:16,860
Some immature person
might hurt them.

1413
01:44:27,460 --> 01:44:28,905
We'll celebrate that day, doctor.

1414
01:44:29,128 --> 01:44:31,199
Oh yes, yes! We'll definitely
celebrate it.

1415
01:44:31,297 --> 01:44:32,605
We'll celebrate it together.

1416
01:44:32,699 --> 01:44:33,973
We'll celebrate it together, dear.

1417
01:44:34,067 --> 01:44:37,708
'Play the colours, its Holi today.'

1418
01:44:38,905 --> 01:44:40,942
'Play the colours, its Holi today.'

1419
01:44:57,924 --> 01:44:59,028
Open the door.

1420
01:45:04,497 --> 01:45:05,703
Don't dare to put colour on me!

1421
01:45:05,832 --> 01:45:08,438
I will! I will definitely
put colour on you today.

1422
01:45:08,835 --> 01:45:11,076
If any one drop falls on me
then just see, I will..

1423
01:45:11,170 --> 01:45:13,741
A drop!? I will drench
you from": head to toe!

1424
01:45:13,940 --> 01:45:17,012
Today on the day of Holi; I will
overcome your daily grief.

1425
01:45:17,243 --> 01:45:19,018
Suman, you'll see me dead!

1426
01:45:24,851 --> 01:45:26,922
You wretched fellow!
You unlucky one!

1427
01:45:31,891 --> 01:45:32,995
Mother!

1428
01:45:33,059 --> 01:45:34,663
Yes! Do you know this?

1429
01:45:34,861 --> 01:45:36,534
Till today I am drenched with
coloured only by him!

1430
01:45:36,596 --> 01:45:37,700
And not by anyone else!

1431
01:45:37,797 --> 01:45:40,710
From the time he has left.. Oh, oh!
He left! He left! He left!

1432
01:45:41,534 --> 01:45:43,445
I don't know why you don't
understand such a small thing.

1433
01:45:43,536 --> 01:45:45,209
That so many years have
passed; he is no more!

1434
01:45:45,304 --> 01:45:47,716
Suman! You wretched fellow!
You rascal!

1435
01:45:47,807 --> 01:45:49,047
Who gave you this right?

1436
01:45:49,142 --> 01:45:51,554
You scoundrel! What do
you think of yourself?

1437
01:45:53,146 --> 01:45:54,216
You do such a thing.

1438
01:45:54,614 --> 01:45:55,888
As if I will never die!

1439
01:45:56,382 --> 01:45:58,123
As if my funeral pyre
won't be lighted!

1440
01:45:58,818 --> 01:46:00,422
You have harassed this sad lady!

1441
01:46:00,987 --> 01:46:02,261
May God bless you!

1442
01:46:02,822 --> 01:46:04,631
Neither I have any daughter or son!

1443
01:46:05,091 --> 01:46:06,331
When my husband is not my own!

1444
01:46:06,893 --> 01:46:08,304
Then who else will be
there in this world?

1445
01:46:14,567 --> 01:46:15,841
What should I do, Santosh?

1446
01:46:16,636 --> 01:46:17,740
Where should I go?

1447
01:46:18,237 --> 01:46:19,341
What is my fault?

1448
01:46:20,473 --> 01:46:22,578
That I loved you!

1449
01:46:23,176 --> 01:46:25,656
No!
- Santosh?

1450
01:46:28,381 --> 01:46:32,295
If you had loved me then..

1451
01:46:35,988 --> 01:46:37,058
Santosh!

1452
01:46:41,594 --> 01:46:42,664
Mother!

1453
01:47:01,881 --> 01:47:04,054
Santosh, mother is not present
here. Mother has gone away somewhere.

1454
01:47:04,217 --> 01:47:05,287
Huh?

1455
01:47:07,286 --> 01:47:11,428
Let her go! We have got rid
of the trouble forever!

1456
01:47:12,525 --> 01:47:14,971
Be thankful about that! Yes,
but where will she go?

1457
01:47:15,061 --> 01:47:16,165
Let her go anywhere.

1458
01:47:16,629 --> 01:47:17,733
Let her wander in the lanes.

1459
01:47:18,130 --> 01:47:21,043
Let her roam on streets, get
ill-treated, beg on roads!

1460
01:47:21,133 --> 01:47:22,237
Why are we concerned?

1461
01:47:23,169 --> 01:47:24,739
At least she won't harass us.

1462
01:47:24,971 --> 01:47:26,382
Did I wanted such happiness?

1463
01:47:27,740 --> 01:47:29,378
What else happiness did you wanted?

1464
01:47:31,577 --> 01:47:33,420
Couldn't she have lived
in her bungalow?

1465
01:47:34,113 --> 01:47:35,786
Couldn't she have lived separately
living here? No!

1466
01:47:38,484 --> 01:47:45,424
Suman, she.. she was me!

1467
01:47:48,394 --> 01:47:53,104
I was she!

1468
01:47:55,468 --> 01:47:56,538
Santosh!

1469
01:47:57,370 --> 01:48:04,219
"I fell in love with
a heartless fellow."

1470
01:48:06,078 --> 01:48:12,427
"I became crazy without him."

1471
01:48:12,485 --> 01:48:13,589
Shanta!

1472
01:48:17,356 --> 01:48:18,664
Didn't I promise you?

1473
01:48:19,692 --> 01:48:21,228
That I'll find out your
husband and bring to you.

1474
01:48:22,828 --> 01:48:23,932
My husband?

1475
01:48:29,468 --> 01:48:30,572
Here is your Gopal!

1476
01:48:35,841 --> 01:48:38,253
Dear, your Shanta!

1477
01:48:39,512 --> 01:48:40,786
And why have you all stopped?

1478
01:48:40,846 --> 01:48:43,190
Play together! Play together!
- Happy Holi!

1479
01:48:48,087 --> 01:48:49,327
"Beyond the gardens."

1480
01:48:49,588 --> 01:48:51,864
"O' fair lass your beloved
awaits you."

1481
01:48:52,091 --> 01:48:56,096
"With love in eyes and
glow on the face."

1482
01:48:56,896 --> 01:48:58,807
"The sari and the blouse
are drenched!"

1483
01:48:59,198 --> 01:49:01,610
"The sari and the blouse
are drenched!"

1484
01:49:01,801 --> 01:49:03,144
"Phagun has arrived!"

1485
01:49:03,202 --> 01:49:05,409
"O' Phagun has arrived!"

1486
01:49:21,988 --> 01:49:24,434
"O' play Holi with your beloved."

1487
01:49:24,490 --> 01:49:26,265
"Play Holi with your beloved."

1488
01:49:27,126 --> 01:49:29,163
"Play Holi with your beloved."

1489
01:49:29,495 --> 01:49:30,735
"Phagun has arrived."

1490
01:49:30,830 --> 01:49:33,140
"O' Phagun has arrived!"

1491
01:49:33,199 --> 01:49:35,736
Where had you gone? Where
had you gone away?

1492
01:49:39,638 --> 01:49:43,381
Such a small mistake and
such a big punishment!

1493
01:49:44,243 --> 01:49:45,313
Gopu!

1494
01:49:46,379 --> 01:49:48,120
I have given this punishment
to myself!

1495
01:49:50,549 --> 01:49:52,722
Come on! Let's go home. Come on.

1496
01:49:53,019 --> 01:49:54,930
Home? To my parent's house?

1497
01:49:55,154 --> 01:49:56,724
No I will not go there.

1498
01:49:56,856 --> 01:49:57,960
Which parent's house?

1499
01:49:58,657 --> 01:50:00,500
I have purchased our house, Shanta.

1500
01:50:00,860 --> 01:50:01,930
Our house!

1501
01:50:03,462 --> 01:50:06,375
Your house!
- Yes! Our house? - Yes Shanta!

1502
01:50:06,532 --> 01:50:07,602
My house!?
- Yes.

1503
01:50:08,067 --> 01:50:09,171
My house!

1504
01:50:11,670 --> 01:50:15,743
Shanta, where is.. where
is my doll daughter?

1505
01:50:16,275 --> 01:50:18,414
There she is! And that
doll boy with her!

1506
01:50:25,885 --> 01:50:31,062
My dolly! Come! Come
to me! Come, my dear!

1507
01:50:32,458 --> 01:50:36,338
My dear, I was desperate
day and night to see you!

1508
01:50:37,430 --> 01:50:41,378
Father! Your beard hurts me!

1509
01:50:42,334 --> 01:50:43,938
"Beyond the gardens."

1510
01:50:44,236 --> 01:50:46,341
"O' fair lass your beloved
awaits you."

1511
01:50:46,839 --> 01:50:50,844
"Love in eyes and glow on the face."

1512
01:50:51,644 --> 01:50:53,988
"The sari and the blouse
are drenched!"

1513
01:50:54,046 --> 01:50:56,322
"The sari and the blouse
are drenched!"

1514
01:50:56,649 --> 01:50:57,957
"Phagun has arrived!"

1515
01:50:58,050 --> 01:51:00,326
"O' Phagun has arrived!"
