1
00:01:46,652 --> 00:01:48,549
There's a cycle for 
everything in this world.

2
00:01:49,167 --> 00:01:50,175
Time has a cycle.

3
00:01:50,608 --> 00:01:51,925
Weather has a cycle.

4
00:01:52,506 --> 00:01:54,154
Every organism has 
a food chain cycle.

5
00:01:54,451 --> 00:01:57,502
Well, even the piece of 
paper that we mint out,

6
00:01:57,527 --> 00:02:00,640
for which everyone goes 
crazy is called the same,

7
00:02:00,665 --> 00:02:02,112
Chakaram (Money).

8
00:02:02,168 --> 00:02:03,463
Did you know,

9
00:02:03,646 --> 00:02:07,938
in this world, which was cluelessly 
spinning, the most greatest invention

10
00:02:07,963 --> 00:02:12,254
of all time, which transformed human 
life significantly, was also called,

11
00:02:12,563 --> 00:02:13,571
Chakaram (Wheel).

12
00:02:18,277 --> 00:02:19,285
Gautham.

13
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:25,952
Hurry up.

14
00:02:27,014 --> 00:02:29,234
- Where were you? 
- I was coming here.

15
00:02:29,546 --> 00:02:30,593
Where's the key?

16
00:02:30,672 --> 00:02:31,786
Oh no! I forgot to take it.

17
00:02:31,811 --> 00:02:33,491
Go and get it fast.

18
00:02:35,785 --> 00:02:37,121
Is that Molushi?

19
00:02:38,266 --> 00:02:39,610
Ramendran from Palakkad,

20
00:02:39,635 --> 00:02:42,045
a gentle and kind soul,

21
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:46,103
and moreover the only postmaster for this 
remote village; was my father, and it is

22
00:02:46,128 --> 00:02:47,973
here, in his ancestral 
home, that me, Gautham,

23
00:02:47,998 --> 00:02:50,351
spent the first 10 
year's of his life.

24
00:02:53,369 --> 00:02:55,705
Sreenu, 
I can't find my cycle's keys.

25
00:02:56,252 --> 00:02:57,260
Its should be there.

26
00:02:57,776 --> 00:02:58,784
Just check there itself.

27
00:02:59,816 --> 00:03:02,136
I had put it on top of 
the cupboard yesterday.

28
00:03:02,161 --> 00:03:03,308
Dad, here are the keys.

29
00:03:08,652 --> 00:03:10,417
Where you out spinning 
the wheel this early.

30
00:03:10,811 --> 00:03:11,818
Dada's Gautham.

31
00:03:14,421 --> 00:03:15,429
Tell him.

32
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:17,754
Dad, please bring honey 
candy when you come.

33
00:03:17,932 --> 00:03:18,939
Why not?

34
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:20,106
How many do you want?

35
00:03:20,915 --> 00:03:21,923
- How many? - Three.

36
00:03:21,948 --> 00:03:22,955
Three.

37
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,940
Does one person 
need three candies?

38
00:03:24,965 --> 00:03:25,981
This kid!

39
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:27,545
Raman, don't waste your money.

40
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:28,867
Dada will bring it.

41
00:03:28,937 --> 00:03:31,070
But let's not give granny any.

42
00:03:31,095 --> 00:03:32,212
Then you needn't buy any.

43
00:03:32,237 --> 00:03:33,245
You may leave.

44
00:03:33,726 --> 00:03:36,054
I will buy it mom, 
you don't worry.

45
00:03:36,573 --> 00:03:38,800
Your blood sugar will shoot up.

46
00:03:41,227 --> 00:03:43,805
Granny, 
used to be my best buddy there.

47
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:47,790
Every evening, granny used to 
tell me epics from mythology.

48
00:03:49,302 --> 00:03:51,247
What an epic!

49
00:03:52,003 --> 00:03:56,612
In order to kill baby Krishna, 
Sakadasuran came rushing toward's him.

50
00:03:56,688 --> 00:04:00,918
I used to gulp down mom's rice and sambar 
listening to granny’s epic thrillers.

51
00:04:01,076 --> 00:04:05,546
And for the war of Mahabharata, 
on a chariot drawn by 7

52
00:04:05,571 --> 00:04:10,280
horses, Krishna and Arjun, 
race towards the battlefield.

53
00:04:10,305 --> 00:04:14,397
Of all of granny's 
stories, I liked Krishna's.

54
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:17,285
Aren't there supposed 
to be 7 horses?

55
00:04:17,894 --> 00:04:19,894
Over here, we have only 2.

56
00:04:20,382 --> 00:04:21,836
The remaining 5 are out grazing.

57
00:04:22,755 --> 00:04:25,160
Because he was the one riding.

58
00:04:26,523 --> 00:04:31,322
She occasionally used to take a break from 
epics, and used to say a real life story.

59
00:04:31,363 --> 00:04:33,621
Back in the day, 
my Raman's father,

60
00:04:33,914 --> 00:04:35,258
your grandfather,

61
00:04:35,889 --> 00:04:38,661
when he used to drive his 
car from Ceylon (Sri Lanka),

62
00:04:40,068 --> 00:04:42,794
he used to have a 
handful of honey candy,

63
00:04:42,819 --> 00:04:46,273
and used to take me out 
for a drive in his car.

64
00:04:47,178 --> 00:04:49,717
Gautham, 
have you ever been inside a car?

65
00:04:50,496 --> 00:04:52,402
Lambi car!

66
00:04:53,299 --> 00:04:55,877
If there's ever a 
car, that's the car.

67
00:04:56,732 --> 00:04:59,982
The man who drive's 
it, that's the man.

68
00:05:00,007 --> 00:05:01,091
Eh?

69
00:05:01,815 --> 00:05:05,932
He used to bring your 
grandfather from, Ceylon

70
00:05:05,976 --> 00:05:09,139
to Palakkad, 
without any damage whatsoever.

71
00:05:10,241 --> 00:05:11,687
If he was there today,

72
00:05:13,138 --> 00:05:15,934
there would have been 
a car in our driveway.

73
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:18,879
The car that was driven from 
Ceylon to Palakkad. Got it?

74
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,534
Catching a glimpse of 
the Ambassador car that

75
00:05:27,559 --> 00:05:30,360
came to our neighbour 
Ousepettan's house

76
00:05:31,019 --> 00:05:33,088
sowed the seeds of 
love in my heart.

77
00:05:33,356 --> 00:05:36,559
And like any boy, 
my first love too was car.

78
00:05:36,584 --> 00:05:39,780
Oh, wish I could even 
get inside an Amby car.

79
00:05:39,816 --> 00:05:44,596
That's when, dad got transferred 
from Palakkad to Cochin.

80
00:05:44,621 --> 00:05:50,043
So finally, an Amby car came to 
my ancestral home's driveway too.

81
00:05:50,702 --> 00:05:54,452
That day, I was really excited about 
getting in the car for the first time..

82
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:59,404
As a souvenir of Palakkad's 
memories, we loaded dad's One

83
00:05:59,429 --> 00:06:03,904
cycle, and drove into a new 
life in Cochin, in a car.

After 8 years, due to the 
unavailability of honey candy, granny

122
00:09:03,952 --> 00:09:06,119
will upgrade herself 
to Cadbury's Silk,

123
00:09:06,144 --> 00:09:09,154
joining forces with all the 
women in the neighborhood,

124
00:09:09,179 --> 00:09:11,696
my mom will start a 
Thiruvathira club,

125
00:09:12,598 --> 00:09:16,747
From that old One's Raleigh Bicycle, 
my father never upgrading his

126
00:09:16,772 --> 00:09:20,122
ride, these were all things that 
I never expected will happen.

127
00:09:21,433 --> 00:09:22,605
Granny, granny.

128
00:09:22,628 --> 00:09:24,596
Granny, do you need silk candy.

129
00:09:25,764 --> 00:09:27,459
Give me some, 
please give me some.

130
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,763
Bug off.

131
00:09:29,837 --> 00:09:30,869
I am leaving.

132
00:09:30,894 --> 00:09:35,025
Back in the day, when your grandfather 
came by car from Ceylon to Palakkad..

133
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:37,095
Granny, I have told you 
many times that you can

134
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,163
no longer fool me with 
this dumb story of yours.

135
00:09:39,721 --> 00:09:40,729
See old lady.

136
00:09:40,776 --> 00:09:41,784
I have got brains now.

137
00:09:41,987 --> 00:09:43,470
- Okay? - Oh!

138
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:46,135
Since when do yo 
have this brain?

139
00:09:47,706 --> 00:09:50,362
Only after my Ramendran was 
born, right?

140
00:09:50,568 --> 00:09:53,530
Listen, whatever it is, 
not just grandpa, but

141
00:09:53,555 --> 00:09:56,063
no one can drive from 
Sri Lanka to here.

142
00:09:56,088 --> 00:09:58,431
You and your dumb stories.

143
00:09:58,456 --> 00:10:01,072
There's a big ocean between 
India and Sri Lanka.

144
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:04,300
My dear genius, you are wrong.

145
00:10:04,781 --> 00:10:07,987
Your grandfather came 
here using the Rama Sethu

146
00:10:08,012 --> 00:10:11,150
(Adam's bridge) built 
by Lord Ram and Hanuman.

147
00:10:11,838 --> 00:10:13,896
Granny, Ramasethu exist's 
only in the mythology.

148
00:10:14,003 --> 00:10:15,011
That doesn't exists now.

149
00:10:15,143 --> 00:10:16,151
Get lost.

150
00:10:16,451 --> 00:10:20,210
Whatever Lord Ram has built, 
will never cease to exist.

151
00:10:20,529 --> 00:10:22,037
Then, I have got news for you.

152
00:10:22,229 --> 00:10:24,463
All of it got washed 
away, a long time ago.

153
00:10:24,862 --> 00:10:27,008
There's no use talking to 
you, silly boy.

154
00:10:27,033 --> 00:10:28,806
Isn't the Ramasethu 
debate over yet?

155
00:10:28,831 --> 00:10:31,235
Mom, she doesn’t get it.

156
00:10:31,716 --> 00:10:33,528
80 years of age, 
but what's the use of it,

157
00:10:33,553 --> 00:10:34,870
don't have the any sense at all.

158
00:10:34,901 --> 00:10:36,031
Mom, do you know,

159
00:10:36,056 --> 00:10:38,730
while I was in 5th grade, 
I boasted this story in school and

160
00:10:38,755 --> 00:10:41,341
got mocked for it till 12th 
grade, by being called Hanuman.

161
00:10:41,698 --> 00:10:43,557
Oh... Hanuman.

162
00:10:43,948 --> 00:10:45,360
The son of Marut.

163
00:10:46,487 --> 00:10:48,182
The immortal one.

164
00:10:48,221 --> 00:10:49,229
Vayu..

165
00:10:49,843 --> 00:10:51,131
Give me back my Silk.

166
00:10:51,495 --> 00:10:52,503
You have had enough.

167
00:10:53,604 --> 00:10:54,612
Move... Move aside.

168
00:10:55,658 --> 00:10:58,112
Why? Why are you hiding it?

169
00:10:58,181 --> 00:11:00,541
Let you students see what their 
spiritual teacher was up to?

170
00:11:00,588 --> 00:11:02,360
No wonder you have this 
tremor in your hands.

171
00:11:02,518 --> 00:11:04,322
It's because you say 
such eye-popping lies.

172
00:11:04,409 --> 00:11:05,417
Here, hold it.

173
00:11:05,651 --> 00:11:08,776
This is because I killed 
a cat while I was a kid.

174
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:10,088
That's why I have these tremors.

175
00:11:11,182 --> 00:11:13,260
Oh, is it? And it has 
nothing to do with your age?

176
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:15,143
Oh, not at all.

177
00:11:15,276 --> 00:11:16,284
Here, just hold me.

178
00:11:18,362 --> 00:11:19,815
Wow, 
you haven't even aged a day.

179
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,352
Hey, 
get off my back you silly boy.

180
00:11:22,385 --> 00:11:24,447
- Oh, is it? 
- Hey Gautham, open up.

181
00:11:27,088 --> 00:11:28,361
After moving out to Cochin,

182
00:11:28,557 --> 00:11:31,025
when granny's stories 
started to do re-run's,

183
00:11:31,456 --> 00:11:32,463
to escape from that,

184
00:11:32,549 --> 00:11:35,970
I arranged the kids from 
the neighborhood for her.

185
00:11:36,651 --> 00:11:37,940
Little did I know,

186
00:11:38,026 --> 00:11:39,955
that it would evolve into 
a weekly Purana Class

187
00:11:40,081 --> 00:11:41,932
and without any shame,

188
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:44,894
that my bestie Venkedi 
will also join.

189
00:11:48,439 --> 00:11:49,447
Payasam.

190
00:11:49,557 --> 00:11:50,564
Behave.

191
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:59,619
And that's how Krishna's 
moral advice helped.

192
00:12:00,135 --> 00:12:04,818
All of a sudden, Karnan's chariots 
wheels got stuck in the battle field.

193
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:08,537
Knew it, this is what happens, 
when you make battlefields over sinkholes.

194
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:09,905
Can you just be quiet?

195
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,846
Venkedi, to whom are 
you lecturing communism?

196
00:12:11,871 --> 00:12:14,623
She is the one, who supports those 
who built road by filling the sea?

197
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:17,260
These ignorant children.

198
00:12:17,549 --> 00:12:21,461
Gautham, don't dare to say a 
word more about Adam's bridge.

199
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:24,009
Adam's bridge doesn't exist, 
doesn't exist, doesn't exist.

200
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:25,997
- Whatever, 
granny continue with you story.

201
00:12:26,022 --> 00:12:27,865
After Karnan's vehicle's 
wheel got stuck, then?

202
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:29,392
This is enough for today.

203
00:12:29,426 --> 00:12:31,394
Spoiled my mood completely.

204
00:12:31,898 --> 00:12:34,394
You kid's go and come 
back after a week.

205
00:12:35,995 --> 00:12:38,268
- Nobody leave. 
- Where are you all to, like small kids?

206
00:12:38,293 --> 00:12:39,503
Sit down, have got a surprise.

207
00:12:39,528 --> 00:12:40,535
Isn't it Payasam?

208
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,945
- Mom, do you want it now? 
- No.

209
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,612
Isn't it Payasam? 
I got the smell of it.

210
00:12:45,002 --> 00:12:46,022
Have it?

211
00:12:46,094 --> 00:12:47,190
I will have the big glass.

212
00:12:47,276 --> 00:12:48,776
Take whichever one you want.

213
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:51,319
Hey, 
how was today's story session?

214
00:12:51,434 --> 00:12:53,357
The story got stuck along 
with Karnan's chariot's

215
00:12:53,382 --> 00:12:54,989
wheel, 
now need to get it out of there.

216
00:12:55,042 --> 00:12:57,094
- Are you upset? 
- What's so special about today,

217
00:12:57,612 --> 00:12:58,799
to have Payasam?

218
00:12:59,471 --> 00:13:01,034
Today is Gautham's 
18th birthday.

219
00:13:01,938 --> 00:13:05,043
Venkedi was really shocked 
to learn the truth.

220
00:13:05,437 --> 00:13:06,608
You turned 18?

221
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,736
I feel shy to wish 
you, happy birthday.

222
00:13:11,902 --> 00:13:13,719
Oh, I almost forgot. 
Happy birthday.

223
00:13:13,787 --> 00:13:14,798
- Thank you. 
- Rock it.

224
00:13:14,837 --> 00:13:16,644
Thank you.

225
00:13:16,669 --> 00:13:17,685
Hey, wish me.

226
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:19,915
As Venkedi stood blushing, 
dad had this piece of advice.

227
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,361
- Happy birthday. 
- Thank you.

228
00:13:21,858 --> 00:13:23,344
- Gautham. 
- Yes dad.

229
00:13:24,921 --> 00:13:26,514
- My dear boy. 
- This is good.

230
00:13:26,588 --> 00:13:27,889
You are a man now.

231
00:13:28,069 --> 00:13:30,139
Without any delay whatsoever,

232
00:13:30,315 --> 00:13:31,643
you need to get a 
driving license.

233
00:13:33,995 --> 00:13:38,730
Realizing that, it was my step 
towards fulfilling my childhood dream,

234
00:13:38,966 --> 00:13:41,344
got prepared for a big battle.

235
00:13:42,082 --> 00:13:45,884
Dad, itself arranged my 
Dhronacharya (Guru) for me.

236
00:13:46,055 --> 00:13:47,406
Master Shibu.

237
00:13:48,195 --> 00:13:49,448
You are Ramettan's son?

238
00:13:49,473 --> 00:13:50,481
Yes.

239
00:13:51,474 --> 00:13:55,052
Ramettan and me, 
we have been friend's for years.

240
00:13:56,307 --> 00:13:57,450
My dad told me.

241
00:13:57,475 --> 00:13:59,639
That's what I am saying, 
don't ruin our friendship.

242
00:14:00,686 --> 00:14:01,693
Absolutely never, uncle.

243
00:14:01,942 --> 00:14:03,153
Don't uncle me.

244
00:14:03,955 --> 00:14:05,064
Master, that's enough.

245
00:14:05,821 --> 00:14:06,969
Okay master.

246
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:09,930
So from tomorrow onwards, 
early morning 6.30.

247
00:14:10,421 --> 00:14:13,210
You should be on the grounds 
here, and not be roaming around.

248
00:14:13,726 --> 00:14:14,937
- Yes Master. 
- Yes Master.

249
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:17,122
Is he also there?

250
00:14:17,158 --> 00:14:21,499
No Master, I will only become 
an adult after 2 more months.

251
00:14:22,353 --> 00:14:24,155
Looks like you will 
need more than that.

252
00:14:25,533 --> 00:14:26,580
My scooter,

253
00:14:26,605 --> 00:14:27,722
Come here, come here.

254
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,509
Will you push my 
scooter to the ground?

255
00:14:29,534 --> 00:14:31,453
Run 10 rounds around the 
ground, in the 8 shape.

256
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,516
I don't this is 
going to work out.

257
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:46,544
So, from tomorrow onwards you are going 
to start running in the shape of 8.

258
00:14:46,751 --> 00:14:47,759
Eh?

259
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:49,270
You are totally screwed.

260
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:53,527
That day,

261
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:56,051
I sat in the driving seat 
of a car for the first time.

262
00:14:56,862 --> 00:14:59,426
Felt my hands on the steering 
wheel, till my hands ached.

263
00:15:00,694 --> 00:15:03,750
Hey, if you touch it so 
softly, like it was some

264
00:15:03,775 --> 00:15:06,894
girls hand, 
you are sure to crash into somewhere.

265
00:15:08,456 --> 00:15:10,029
Well, I was just.

266
00:15:11,532 --> 00:15:12,608
So, shall I start the car?

267
00:15:12,633 --> 00:15:13,962
You aren't ready to start yet.

268
00:15:13,987 --> 00:15:15,577
I will let you know, 
when you are ready.

269
00:15:15,602 --> 00:15:16,742
So, shouldn't I drive this?

270
00:15:16,767 --> 00:15:20,789
Before you drive, there are a few 
things I need to clear with you.

271
00:15:20,814 --> 00:15:21,939
What is it?

272
00:15:22,613 --> 00:15:23,936
What is driving?

273
00:15:31,178 --> 00:15:32,186
Don't know?

274
00:15:33,758 --> 00:15:34,765
Listen,

275
00:15:35,807 --> 00:15:37,545
driving is an art.

276
00:15:38,352 --> 00:15:40,726
An art which requires your 
mind, body and soul.

277
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,307
There is a method to it.

278
00:15:43,662 --> 00:15:44,842
You need to have flow for it.

279
00:15:46,457 --> 00:15:47,973
Not everyone can master it.

280
00:15:49,435 --> 00:15:51,517
And that's what you are 
going to learn from today.

281
00:15:51,542 --> 00:15:52,550
Okay?

282
00:15:52,888 --> 00:15:53,896
Okay.

283
00:15:54,324 --> 00:15:57,810
You need to have a few 
things to learn this art.

284
00:15:58,497 --> 00:15:59,505
Know what are those?

285
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:00,537
No...

286
00:16:00,951 --> 00:16:02,750
Hmm. No. Note it down.

287
00:16:04,365 --> 00:16:06,612
Well, I don't have 
a book or pen on me.

288
00:16:06,637 --> 00:16:09,035
Damn, you ruined it.

289
00:16:09,978 --> 00:16:11,745
You won't get to 
learn this elsewhere.

290
00:16:12,042 --> 00:16:14,189
These are stuff that I 
figured out on my own.

291
00:16:14,674 --> 00:16:15,682
Well Master,

292
00:16:15,707 --> 00:16:17,742
I didn't bring it because 
it was the driving class.

293
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,461
Fine, let it be.

294
00:16:20,933 --> 00:16:21,949
Keep these in your mind.

295
00:16:21,974 --> 00:16:23,099
- Don't loose it. 
- Never.

296
00:16:24,146 --> 00:16:25,177
Okay.

297
00:16:26,499 --> 00:16:28,188
The things that we 
need for driving are:

298
00:16:28,531 --> 00:16:30,433
1. Patience.

299
00:16:30,645 --> 00:16:32,491
2. Confidence.

300
00:16:32,516 --> 00:16:34,105
3. Consciousness.

301
00:16:34,238 --> 00:16:35,912
4. Concentration.

302
00:16:36,247 --> 00:16:38,121
5. Compromise.

303
00:16:39,726 --> 00:16:41,871
If you have these five 
things, you can make it

304
00:16:41,896 --> 00:16:43,995
out alive, 
without getting run over by a truck.

305
00:16:44,338 --> 00:16:45,346
Okay?

306
00:16:46,278 --> 00:16:47,286
Master!

307
00:16:49,543 --> 00:16:50,813
You are awesome.

308
00:16:51,129 --> 00:16:52,765
There is a lot more to 
learn, my child.

309
00:16:52,946 --> 00:16:53,954
Is it?

310
00:16:54,238 --> 00:16:55,246
Alright, lets begin.

311
00:16:55,691 --> 00:16:56,831
Start it.

312
00:16:59,064 --> 00:17:00,072
What about the belt?

313
00:17:00,631 --> 00:17:02,780
- Put on the belt. 
- Oh, sorry, sorry.

314
00:17:02,805 --> 00:17:03,868
I forgot.

315
00:17:03,893 --> 00:17:04,901
Put it.

316
00:17:06,739 --> 00:17:07,770
Okay... Okay.

317
00:17:07,795 --> 00:17:10,155
- Now start it. 
- Oh God watch over me.

318
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,099
Gear.. Gear.

319
00:17:15,314 --> 00:17:16,321
Like this?

320
00:17:16,346 --> 00:17:18,416
Press. Accelerator.

321
00:17:20,259 --> 00:17:21,846
Release.

322
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:28,102
- Do you start it in gear? 
- Sorry..Sorry.

323
00:17:28,146 --> 00:17:30,803
Clutch, clutch, accelerator. 
Clutch, clutch, accelerator.

324
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,770
- Tell me the A B C of the car. 
- This car's?

325
00:17:35,593 --> 00:17:37,353
Model name: Maruthi 
Suzuki 800 AC.

326
00:17:37,378 --> 00:17:38,549

Maximum power: 47 bhp.

Predicted Mileage: 22.47 Km pl.

331
00:17:47,116 --> 00:17:49,297
Hey, not that. Not that.

332
00:17:49,322 --> 00:17:50,322
- Then? 
- ABC.

333
00:17:50,347 --> 00:17:51,347
Accelerator.

334
00:17:51,372 --> 00:17:53,290
Brake. Clutch.

335
00:17:53,315 --> 00:17:56,815
Hey, first look at the neutral, 
after that press the clutch slowly.

336
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:00,043
Press the accelerator, 
press it slowly, put it in neutral.

337
00:18:00,068 --> 00:18:01,450
After that, slowly start it.

338
00:18:08,311 --> 00:18:09,350
Consciousness.

339
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:13,929
Patience.

340
00:18:14,683 --> 00:18:15,691
Confidence.

341
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:18,457
Consciousness.

342
00:18:19,174 --> 00:18:20,181
Then.

343
00:18:20,618 --> 00:18:22,397
Hey, you only need go 
as far as third now.

344
00:18:24,609 --> 00:18:26,773
- Concentration, concentration. 
- Concentration.

345
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,255
Hey, patience.

346
00:18:40,945 --> 00:18:41,953
Confidence.

347
00:18:51,418 --> 00:18:53,305
Hit the breaks. 
Hit the breaks....

348
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:55,461
We are gonna crash.

349
00:19:04,656 --> 00:19:06,694
Just like that, 
after tons of experiments,

350
00:19:06,898 --> 00:19:07,906
Compromise.

351
00:19:07,983 --> 00:19:08,991
That day finally came.

352
00:19:09,935 --> 00:19:10,943
My trial by fire.

353
00:19:10,968 --> 00:19:12,134
Driving Test.

354
00:19:14,844 --> 00:19:16,570
In my granny's words,

355
00:19:16,881 --> 00:19:21,131
I got nervous, like the Abhimanyu 
who got stuck in Chakravyuha.

356
00:19:23,752 --> 00:19:29,515
But, with Dronacharya guiding me from 
outside, by the skin of my teeth,

357
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:31,550
I cleared my driving test.

358
00:19:56,697 --> 00:20:00,827
Like Eklavya, who gifted his own 
thumb to his guru, Dronacharya,

359
00:20:01,351 --> 00:20:05,515
I gifted a bottle of Whiskey to Master 
Shibu, and got going from there.

360
00:20:14,183 --> 00:20:15,191
He got his license.

361
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:20,509
- Gautham. 
- Yes dad.

362
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:24,119
You are the one who has to take care 
of this family, after I am gone.

363
00:20:25,647 --> 00:20:27,714
In the coming future, 
you won't be able to make it

364
00:20:27,739 --> 00:20:29,486
anywhere, 
if you travel by cycle like me.

365
00:20:29,511 --> 00:20:31,496
As if, he has made it somewhere?

366
00:20:32,918 --> 00:20:34,381
It's not like that.

367
00:20:35,828 --> 00:20:39,335
In today's world, 
one can't live without a car.

368
00:20:39,372 --> 00:20:40,403
What?

369
00:20:41,504 --> 00:20:43,561
So, why don't we buy a car?

370
00:20:43,595 --> 00:20:45,135
Eh? For real.

371
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,408
Dad!

372
00:20:46,831 --> 00:20:51,620
And, just like that, 
my dad got my heart racing once more.

373
00:20:56,144 --> 00:20:58,454
It's for you to choose, 
the car you wish to drive.

374
00:20:58,511 --> 00:20:59,549
Wow!

375
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:02,333
"Who needs a cab, 
if your friend has a ride?",

376
00:21:02,641 --> 00:21:08,125
with that as their motto, Kichu and 
Alby also joined in to choose a car.

377
00:21:09,069 --> 00:21:12,276
We need to have car that has an 
opening on top, one that can fly.

378
00:21:12,382 --> 00:21:14,843
It needs to have a boot large 
enough to fit 12 case of beer.

379
00:21:14,999 --> 00:21:16,859
I am not allowed to drive our car,

380
00:21:16,926 --> 00:21:18,580
I hope I atleast get to drive yours.

381
00:21:19,341 --> 00:21:20,349
Honda City.

382
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:21,715
How is it?

383
00:21:21,941 --> 00:21:23,708
This is the same car we have at 
home, you buy

384
00:21:23,733 --> 00:21:25,424
this, atleast I get 
to drive it that way.

385
00:21:25,472 --> 00:21:27,764
Look, this car goes well 
with our swag.

386
00:21:27,933 --> 00:21:29,115
- Is it? 
- Yeah, this is it.

387
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:31,435
Please buy this. Please. 
This is an awesome car.

388
00:21:32,053 --> 00:21:35,282
If that's what you all 
feel, then we will fix this.

389
00:21:37,949 --> 00:21:41,190
Hmm, this car looks regal.

390
00:21:46,609 --> 00:21:48,914
This would look splendid 
in our driveway,

391
00:21:48,939 --> 00:21:50,197
- Isn't it Sreenu? 
- Let me see.

392
00:21:52,571 --> 00:21:53,836
Yeah.

393
00:21:55,238 --> 00:21:56,246
- Dad. 
- Yes.

394
00:21:56,271 --> 00:21:57,798
Our Alby also has the same car.

395
00:21:57,876 --> 00:21:59,879
- Oh. 
- Uncle, it's an awesome car.

396
00:22:00,035 --> 00:22:01,246
Power steering, power window,

397
00:22:01,277 --> 00:22:03,035
power bag, ADBS, has got everything.

398
00:22:04,151 --> 00:22:05,965
If the car crashes, 
a balloon will pop in the

399
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:07,722
car. That's why he 
doesn't get to drive it.

400
00:22:07,752 --> 00:22:10,049
If it has balloon in it,

401
00:22:10,074 --> 00:22:11,551
then why don't we fix this.

402
00:22:11,613 --> 00:22:12,621
Let's fix it.

403
00:22:13,002 --> 00:22:14,096
Dad.

404
00:22:14,155 --> 00:22:16,402
They only have the base 
model at Alby's home,

405
00:22:16,427 --> 00:22:18,454
but we need to have 
the full option model.

406
00:22:18,479 --> 00:22:19,676
Well, full?

407
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:21,105
We will go for the full portion.

408
00:22:21,277 --> 00:22:22,285
Full?

409
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:23,433
Full, yes we will have full.

410
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:27,387
Full, that's nice. That's the right thing 
to do. You need to buy full when buying it.

411
00:22:27,412 --> 00:22:29,285
By the way, 
how much do we need to pay upfront.

412
00:22:29,574 --> 00:22:33,875
Base model is around 0.8, 
but we will get the full option for 1.

413
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:35,215
Yes, 1 million.

414
00:22:35,418 --> 00:22:36,511
It's a steal for 1 million.

415
00:22:36,668 --> 00:22:39,980
I thought it would have been 1.4, 
especially a Honda City, getting it for 1.

416
00:22:42,933 --> 00:22:45,409
When dad got scared on 
hearing the price of new car,

417
00:22:45,434 --> 00:22:47,861
that's when dad announced 
the name of his new drama.

418
00:22:49,121 --> 00:22:50,191
Never buy it fresh,

419
00:22:50,886 --> 00:22:52,484
always buy it used.

420
00:22:53,483 --> 00:22:54,631
Dad, what are you saying,

421
00:22:54,656 --> 00:22:56,100
buying used is not going to workout.

422
00:22:57,403 --> 00:23:00,253
You dad, doesn't have that 
kind of money, my dear.

423
00:23:01,093 --> 00:23:02,820
0.8 to 1 million!

424
00:23:03,113 --> 00:23:04,308
We will buy a good used...

425
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,558
Dad, used cars are trouble,

426
00:23:05,652 --> 00:23:07,402
it will breakdown easily.

427
00:23:08,027 --> 00:23:09,613
Hey, make him understand.

428
00:23:09,829 --> 00:23:11,110
Used cars are...

429
00:23:11,144 --> 00:23:13,746
it will drain our money 
for parts and service.

430
00:23:13,777 --> 00:23:15,683
We needn't fear that for new.

431
00:23:15,722 --> 00:23:17,308
If all of you try really hard,

432
00:23:17,333 --> 00:23:21,418
we will have a car with all the 
desired qualities in our driveway.

433
00:23:21,443 --> 00:23:23,090
Is this a marriage 
proposal or what?

434
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:24,254
Exactly!

435
00:23:24,285 --> 00:23:27,636
- Here we go. 
- Bringing a car home,

436
00:23:27,902 --> 00:23:30,269
is like bringing a new person home.

437
00:23:30,294 --> 00:23:33,771
It will go on to become a 
symbol of the whole family.

438
00:23:33,949 --> 00:23:37,815
So we need to be mindful of 
everything, when buying it.

439
00:23:38,006 --> 00:23:39,436
Heard that?

440
00:23:39,461 --> 00:23:40,476
So, it's decided then.

441
00:23:40,501 --> 00:23:42,441
Dad, lets not go for an used.

442
00:23:42,496 --> 00:23:43,504
We will go for a new one.

443
00:23:43,535 --> 00:23:44,715
Just think it over.

444
00:23:45,047 --> 00:23:46,875
I am feeling thirsty, 
what's there for dinner.

445
00:23:47,019 --> 00:23:48,027
Porridge.

446
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,423
- Perfect. 
- Then get me some.

447
00:23:49,558 --> 00:23:50,605
Alright then.

448
00:23:56,816 --> 00:23:59,778
But Venkedi's 
determination to find a

449
00:23:59,803 --> 00:24:02,703
super-car among used 
car's got me here.

450
00:24:03,558 --> 00:24:04,808
Isn't it awesome?

451
00:24:07,208 --> 00:24:08,966
Step away from the 
front, Gautham.

452
00:24:09,105 --> 00:24:10,230
Let me see it.

453
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:15,503
Hmm, it looks really regal.

454
00:24:15,528 --> 00:24:16,921
Enough about it's regalness,

455
00:24:16,946 --> 00:24:18,494
don't spoil it when 
you hear the price.

456
00:24:18,519 --> 00:24:19,527
That's true.

457
00:24:19,878 --> 00:24:21,143
It costs 250,000.

458
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:22,176
Can you buy it dad?

459
00:24:31,352 --> 00:24:32,540
In that case,

460
00:24:32,881 --> 00:24:34,746
we need to pay a token 
advance today itself.

461
00:24:38,936 --> 00:24:39,944
Sreenu,

462
00:24:44,485 --> 00:24:46,724
On agreeing to granny's 
condition, that the

463
00:24:46,749 --> 00:24:49,190
vehicle should be bought 
in on an auspicious day,

464
00:24:49,894 --> 00:24:55,992
me and Venkedi, handed over the token 
advance amount of 1501 to the dealer.

465
00:24:56,768 --> 00:24:59,493
And now the wait begins.

Granny,

488
00:27:33,661 --> 00:27:35,005
Where's dad?

489
00:27:35,149 --> 00:27:39,082
My son Raman and his 
friend, has gone to get him.

490
00:27:41,837 --> 00:27:45,691
Someone new is going to join, 
to be the symbol of our family.

491
00:27:48,204 --> 00:27:50,931
Like Lord Ganesha has 
Mushak as his vehicle,

492
00:27:50,956 --> 00:27:53,688
like Lord Ayyappa has 
tiger as his vehicle,

493
00:27:53,787 --> 00:27:57,396
to make my Gautham's 
life eventful,

494
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,493
Gautham's chariot.

495
00:28:38,288 --> 00:28:42,456
And that's how, a Mahabharata 
War got started in our kitchen.

496
00:28:42,602 --> 00:28:44,143
My Mitsubishi Lancer.

497
00:28:44,168 --> 00:28:45,648
Hey Gautham, 
just hear out your dad.

498
00:28:45,673 --> 00:28:46,681
Why did you cheat me?

499
00:28:46,782 --> 00:28:48,243
This isn't what you promised me.

500
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:49,747
From where did you find this?

501
00:28:49,977 --> 00:28:52,206
- Mom, are you in support of this. 
- Just hear me out.

502
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:53,367
Mom, not a word.

503
00:28:53,445 --> 00:28:54,911
- Dad, you speak. 
- Let me explain.

504
00:28:54,936 --> 00:28:55,994
No need for that too.

505
00:28:56,019 --> 00:28:58,040
Get this damn car off here now.

506
00:28:58,079 --> 00:29:00,666
- It's not a damn car. 
- Give me the keys.

507
00:29:00,691 --> 00:29:02,414
Is it with Master? 
I will ask him.

508
00:29:02,439 --> 00:29:03,876
Master. Give me those.

509
00:29:04,056 --> 00:29:05,389
Not that. The keys.

510
00:29:05,425 --> 00:29:06,523
- Go. 
- Gautham.

511
00:29:06,548 --> 00:29:08,579
What's this my dear? 
Let me explain.

512
00:29:09,063 --> 00:29:10,071
No need, let me speak.

513
00:29:10,102 --> 00:29:13,159
Isn't it because you all agreed that 
I paid the advance for the vehicle.

514
00:29:13,485 --> 00:29:14,889
I really wished for it.

515
00:29:15,118 --> 00:29:16,871
And then you come with a bug.

516
00:29:17,111 --> 00:29:19,276
Granny, don't you atleast 
feel like saying something.

517
00:29:19,392 --> 00:29:23,788
It's not the bug, my dear, 
it's a really cute looking car.

518
00:29:23,813 --> 00:29:26,070
- Our Kunjuttan. 
- Kunjuttan?

519
00:29:26,161 --> 00:29:27,407
Dad, are you hearing this?

520
00:29:27,621 --> 00:29:32,290
Yes, my dear, what you told is entirely 
correct, and we all liked that car too.

521
00:29:32,931 --> 00:29:37,589
But, only later did I realize that 
we were going into a grave danger.

522
00:29:38,087 --> 00:29:39,095
Danger?

523
00:29:39,282 --> 00:29:40,477
- Hmm. 
- What danger?

524
00:29:40,985 --> 00:29:41,993
Financial danger.

525
00:29:42,321 --> 00:29:46,365
That's when dad told how the Lancer 
got magically transformed into a Nano.

526
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:48,798
Shibu, this is Ramendran.

527
00:29:49,102 --> 00:29:52,298
What is it Ramettan?

528
00:29:52,727 --> 00:29:57,173
Nothing much, 
I have decided to buy a car.

529
00:29:57,374 --> 00:29:59,501
Awesome, which car, what car?

530
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:01,407
Car... Car... Car....

531
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:02,868
Mitsu.

532
00:30:02,893 --> 00:30:04,634
Misushibu Lancer.

533
00:30:04,937 --> 00:30:07,554
Stop.. Stop... Stop... 
My dear Ramettan.

534
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,930
Are you mad to pour 
money down the drain?

535
00:30:12,618 --> 00:30:14,364
What is it Shibu? 
Is there something wrong?

536
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,140
- Ramettan. 
- Yeah.

537
00:30:17,285 --> 00:30:20,945
Driving your own car, is not like 
driving the car from the driving school.

538
00:30:21,146 --> 00:30:23,739
Before driving our own car, 
we need to be really experienced.

539
00:30:24,852 --> 00:30:26,602
We need to have a bond with car.

540
00:30:27,396 --> 00:30:31,775
In Ladakh, who was it that helped 
me drive through the twisty roads?

541
00:30:32,461 --> 00:30:33,469
Who was it?

542
00:30:33,755 --> 00:30:34,763
This bond.

543
00:30:36,225 --> 00:30:38,029
It's true that Gautham is my disciple,

544
00:30:38,154 --> 00:30:39,162
and he respects me too.

545
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:42,302
But he is not experienced 
enough to drive his own car.

546
00:30:42,435 --> 00:30:43,552
He has a long way to go.

547
00:30:44,303 --> 00:30:45,970
To gain experience,

548
00:30:46,324 --> 00:30:47,902
its better that you 
go for a small car.

549
00:30:48,615 --> 00:30:49,849
- Is it? 
- Yes.

550
00:30:50,378 --> 00:30:54,779
Now Ramettan, the car that you are thinking 
about buying is as huge as a Patton tank.

551
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,162
If you buy it, 
he is going to go cruising on it.

552
00:30:57,187 --> 00:30:58,730
And he is bound to 
crash it somewhere.

553
00:30:58,755 --> 00:31:00,349
And when you go for repairs,

554
00:31:00,374 --> 00:31:01,762
that's when you 
find out about it.

555
00:31:01,787 --> 00:31:04,574
Spare parts for this vehicle 
are no longer available.

556
00:31:04,848 --> 00:31:06,184
Is it?

557
00:31:12,484 --> 00:31:16,528
Master Shibu, the one who got high on 
my Whiskey, and screwed me from behind.

558
00:31:17,047 --> 00:31:18,781
Oh my teacher!

559
00:31:18,926 --> 00:31:21,336
Dad, then why didn't you 
tell me about this earlier?

560
00:31:21,478 --> 00:31:24,774
Master Shibu told that, 
let this be a surprise for you.

561
00:31:25,505 --> 00:31:27,084
Is this a surprise?

562
00:31:27,443 --> 00:31:29,498
I didn't even tell your mother.

563
00:31:29,787 --> 00:31:30,794
Weren't you surprised?

564
00:31:30,869 --> 00:31:33,205
Of course, 
I was really surprised.

565
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:35,566
My dear, just listen your dad.

566
00:31:35,838 --> 00:31:38,800
When you gain a little more experience, 
like how Master Shibu suggested,

567
00:31:38,925 --> 00:31:40,562
then we will buy a 
new car immediately.

568
00:31:40,714 --> 00:31:41,722
Exactly.

569
00:31:41,793 --> 00:31:43,349
Gain experience, 
and get a new car.

570
00:31:44,188 --> 00:31:46,133
You have nothing to fear,

571
00:31:46,158 --> 00:31:48,963
just remember what I taught you.

572
00:31:49,389 --> 00:31:51,662
You have all my blessings.

573
00:31:51,776 --> 00:31:52,784
- Master, 
- Yes.

574
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:55,876
Wouldn't someone die, 
even if they get run over by a Nano car?

575
00:31:57,878 --> 00:31:59,681
I need to go 
somewhere immediately.

576
00:32:00,334 --> 00:32:01,545
Here, accept this.

577
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:02,748
Give it to him.

578
00:32:08,178 --> 00:32:09,318
Don't be silly.

579
00:32:10,823 --> 00:32:12,354
Hold it. Bye then.

580
00:32:12,531 --> 00:32:14,200
It's a big deal, 
what you have done Shibu.

581
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:19,352
This four legged beast that came into 
my house, shattering all my hopes,

582
00:32:20,185 --> 00:32:23,861
slowly started to take up 
my place in the family.

583
00:32:27,842 --> 00:32:31,491
For dad, he became dad's 
favorite plaything.

584
00:32:31,836 --> 00:32:35,004
I am leaving. 
There's no one to pamper me like this.

585
00:32:35,163 --> 00:32:37,067
Mom, where is the shampoo?

586
00:32:37,149 --> 00:32:39,905
But it was mom's name for 
him, that stuck.

587
00:32:40,078 --> 00:32:41,086
Move.

588
00:32:41,111 --> 00:32:42,991
Shibu asked to bathNanappan with shampoo.

589
00:32:43,868 --> 00:32:47,596
Even granny too had shifted her 
allegiance and he became her Kunjuttan.

590
00:32:47,621 --> 00:32:50,051
Kunjuttan, 
did you have your bath?

591
00:32:50,246 --> 00:32:53,598
Now, you will look really 
smart, if you go to the temple.

592
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:57,421
Granny has kept a gift for you.

593
00:33:04,337 --> 00:33:05,345
Sonny,

594
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:06,378
please wait.

595
00:33:06,505 --> 00:33:08,568
From now on, 
you don't have to hurl the newspaper,

596
00:33:08,675 --> 00:33:12,194
you can fold and 
keep it like this.

597
00:33:12,856 --> 00:33:13,864
That's enough.

598
00:33:14,056 --> 00:33:16,064
So, there are such advantages 
too of buying a car.

599
00:33:18,842 --> 00:33:20,576
Yes, it's good to 
have ones own car.

600
00:33:21,613 --> 00:33:23,323
You owe us a treat.

601
00:33:24,771 --> 00:33:26,036
It's better if you say it.

602
00:33:27,944 --> 00:33:28,951
I can't, you say it.

603
00:33:29,566 --> 00:33:31,206
Didn't you agree to say it?

604
00:33:31,459 --> 00:33:35,225
Hey, we were all kind 
of waiting for you.

605
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:39,665
My wish is to get our Kunjuttan 
baptized in Guruvayoor.

606
00:33:40,112 --> 00:33:41,120
Baptize?

607
00:33:41,747 --> 00:33:45,679
Well, to bless Kunjuttan's 
keys from there.

608
00:33:46,631 --> 00:33:47,819
That, we can do.

609
00:33:47,861 --> 00:33:49,562
But, we are not going 
there anytime soon.

610
00:33:49,586 --> 00:33:50,662
Well, we need to go there.

611
00:33:50,687 --> 00:33:52,170
There's a function 
happening there.

612
00:33:52,195 --> 00:33:54,058
Tomorrow, 
at our family home in Guruvayoor,

613
00:33:54,083 --> 00:33:56,072
it's Rajeevan's daughters 
ear piercing ceremony.

614
00:33:56,153 --> 00:33:58,217
Don't you remember 
Uncle Rajeevan?

615
00:33:59,226 --> 00:34:00,719
So what?

616
00:34:01,345 --> 00:34:04,660
So, tomorrow all of us go to 
Guruvayoor tomorrow with Nanappan,

617
00:34:04,685 --> 00:34:07,578
and while we are there, 
we get Nanappan's keys blessed.

618
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:13,061
To have your keys blessed in front of Lord 
Guruvayoor Appan, well what can I say,

619
00:34:13,174 --> 00:34:14,737
Kunjuttan is really lucky.

620
00:34:14,762 --> 00:34:15,917
Oh my Lord Guruvayoor Appan.

621
00:34:16,287 --> 00:34:19,026
Dad, I can't come tomorrow,

622
00:34:19,327 --> 00:34:20,835
I have got other 
plans for tomorrow.

623
00:34:21,015 --> 00:34:22,546
What is this, Gautham?

624
00:34:22,797 --> 00:34:26,112
We buy a car for the first time, and when 
we plan to go to the temple together.

625
00:34:26,185 --> 00:34:27,706
And you say, 
you have got other plans?

626
00:34:28,109 --> 00:34:29,585
Whatever it is, 
have it postponed.

627
00:34:30,466 --> 00:34:33,260
It's not like that mom, 
I have got important stuff...

628
00:34:33,285 --> 00:34:36,394
Aren't you the one who is supposed 
to take care of Dad, Mom and Granny?

629
00:34:36,419 --> 00:34:38,428
Who else do we have?

630
00:34:38,734 --> 00:34:41,031
My dear, 
can't you drive that far?

631
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,828
And so even that got decided.

632
00:34:45,106 --> 00:34:48,298
I was to become 
Nanappan's caretaker.

633
00:34:48,916 --> 00:34:49,923
We will go.

634
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,048
- Hmm? 
- Belt.

635
00:35:07,506 --> 00:35:08,514
So shall we leave?

636
00:35:08,538 --> 00:35:10,688
Wait. 
Just don't leave yet Gautham.

637
00:35:13,075 --> 00:35:19,017
Isn't it our Kunjuttan's Baptism 
today, here’s a gift from Granny.

638
00:35:21,652 --> 00:35:24,870
The son of Marut. 
Anjaneya Swami.

639
00:35:26,696 --> 00:35:31,031
Kunjuttan will get my 
Gautham out of any trouble,

640
00:35:32,094 --> 00:35:33,101
Shall we go?

641
00:35:48,701 --> 00:35:49,708
Hey Sashindran,

642
00:35:49,937 --> 00:35:51,398
I bought a new car.

643
00:36:00,974 --> 00:36:01,982
Hey Gautham,

644
00:36:02,289 --> 00:36:03,594
what wrong with this Ramettan?

645
00:36:03,913 --> 00:36:07,365
With this 125,000, 
couldn't you have bought a better car?

646
00:36:07,642 --> 00:36:08,830
Your dad's crazy.

647
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:11,250
Isn't he your own 
brother in law,

648
00:36:11,386 --> 00:36:12,609
can't you say it to his face?

649
00:36:12,701 --> 00:36:14,147
I loose it, when I see them....

650
00:37:02,505 --> 00:37:03,513
Prakashettan,

651
00:37:03,716 --> 00:37:04,724
I am leaving.

652
00:37:04,788 --> 00:37:05,796
Are you leaving by train?

653
00:37:05,872 --> 00:37:08,552
I forgot to say, 
I bought a new car.

654
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:10,697
That's good, 
it's more than enough for him.

655
00:37:12,159 --> 00:37:13,230
Hey Gautham,

656
00:37:14,698 --> 00:37:17,830
Gautham my dear. 
This is an awesome car, make it fly.

657
00:37:19,054 --> 00:37:20,374
Trial..Trial..

658
00:37:20,468 --> 00:37:23,788
- It was trial. 
- It was out.

659
00:37:23,921 --> 00:37:26,771
That's not an out. 
His leg was still in the crease.

660
00:37:26,796 --> 00:37:29,836
Move aside. Move. 
All of you go and play alone.

661
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:33,329
Gautham, did you clear 
all your paper in college?

662
00:37:33,699 --> 00:37:34,707
Yes, I did.

663
00:37:34,746 --> 00:37:36,231
Really, did you pass everything.

664
00:37:37,217 --> 00:37:38,712
Yes, I did pass. 
What is it with you?

665
00:37:39,285 --> 00:37:41,613
Heard your dad bought a 
four wheeled auto rickshaw.

666
00:37:42,264 --> 00:37:43,520
Hey Venky, don't go there.

667
00:37:43,708 --> 00:37:45,276
Don't go where?

668
00:37:45,301 --> 00:37:47,335
Weren't you the one, 
trying to avoid me in college?

669
00:37:47,424 --> 00:37:49,198
We were supposed 
to buy a Lancer.

670
00:37:49,223 --> 00:37:52,027
That's when you dad buy's a four 
wheeled air conditioned auto rickshaw.

671
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:54,496
Don't be so mean. No matter 
what, a car will always be a car.

672
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,856
There are 2 types of cars. 
The first one is, car;

673
00:37:57,153 --> 00:37:58,865
and there is, 
whatever that he bought now.

674
00:37:58,898 --> 00:38:00,168
Hey, don't push it.

675
00:38:00,193 --> 00:38:01,670
- Why? 
- Those who don't get to touch

676
00:38:01,695 --> 00:38:02,989
their own car's needn't lecture.

677
00:38:03,247 --> 00:38:04,255
But I will.

678
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,356
What all did you say then?

679
00:38:05,381 --> 00:38:07,198
Even if you didn't buy, 
I had a lot of dreams.

680
00:38:07,231 --> 00:38:08,356
Trip to Munnar,

681
00:38:08,401 --> 00:38:10,355
with a boot filled with 
beer, sunroof.

682
00:38:10,434 --> 00:38:11,442
You had to ruin it all.

683
00:38:11,785 --> 00:38:14,051
Hey, we still can go 
for trip to Munnar.

684
00:38:14,133 --> 00:38:15,499
We can hire a cab, 
if we have to.

685
00:38:15,633 --> 00:38:17,771
Hiring a cab till Munnar, brilliant. 
Move aside.

686
00:38:18,132 --> 00:38:20,591
Go and sit in your auto rickshaw. 
I have to go to the store.

687
00:38:20,746 --> 00:38:23,003
Hey, it wasn't me, 
but my dad who bought the car.

688
00:38:23,285 --> 00:38:25,283
You don't need to say 
much about your dad,

689
00:38:25,308 --> 00:38:27,398
doesn't he still cycle 
with center stand on.

690
00:38:28,668 --> 00:38:29,676
Gauthametta.

691
00:38:30,525 --> 00:38:31,533
What is it?

692
00:38:31,837 --> 00:38:33,823
Can you atleast 
install a sunroof?

693
00:38:34,117 --> 00:38:37,004
Hey Kichu, assume we only 
got 1000 sq feet of land,

694
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:40,754
and if 800 sq feet goes for the pool, 
then what am I to do with the rest?

695
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,686
What is it, all gloomy?

696
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:54,375
Nothing like that.

697
00:38:54,879 --> 00:38:56,372
- Are you upset with me? 
- Why?

698
00:38:57,238 --> 00:38:58,535
Then I am upset with you.

699
00:38:58,759 --> 00:39:01,152
Upset! For what?

700
00:39:01,442 --> 00:39:03,411
Why didn't you tell me 
that you bought a car?

701
00:39:07,171 --> 00:39:08,304
Who told you about the car?

702
00:39:08,491 --> 00:39:09,511
Venkedi.

703
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:12,273
Oh my God!

704
00:39:14,517 --> 00:39:16,548
Sir, how about we do 
Malayalam poetry recitation...

705
00:39:16,573 --> 00:39:17,964
Yeah, it was Venkedi.

706
00:39:19,769 --> 00:39:22,210
Why didn't you tell me 
that you bought a car?

707
00:39:22,644 --> 00:39:25,137
Well, I wanted it to 
be a surprise for you.

708
00:39:25,162 --> 00:39:26,186
Really?

709
00:39:26,916 --> 00:39:28,237
What's there to 
be surprised now?

710
00:39:28,262 --> 00:39:32,228
Since your surprise has been ruined 
anyway, will you do something for me?

711
00:39:32,397 --> 00:39:33,522
Why not?

712
00:39:33,713 --> 00:39:35,422
What is it that my 
dear Nimmy wishes for?

713
00:39:35,447 --> 00:39:36,814
Isn't the college day tomorrow?

714
00:39:36,839 --> 00:39:37,847
Yes it is.

715
00:39:37,945 --> 00:39:39,507
Could you then bring 
your car tomorrow?

716
00:39:41,441 --> 00:39:43,040
- Car? 
- Why, is it too much to ask?

717
00:39:44,668 --> 00:39:45,675
Tomorrow?

718
00:39:46,469 --> 00:39:47,994
Tomorrow is Friday, 
sorry can't do it.

719
00:39:48,253 --> 00:39:50,143
I have to get the vehicle 
registered, tomorrow.

720
00:39:50,168 --> 00:39:52,236
Tomorrow is Thursday, 
they won't register it then.

721
00:39:52,261 --> 00:39:53,269
Then, it should be fine?

722
00:39:53,387 --> 00:39:55,099
- Tomorrow is Thursday? 
- Yes.

723
00:39:56,492 --> 00:39:57,500
- So,.. 
- So?

724
00:39:57,548 --> 00:39:59,475
- You can bring the car? 
- I can bring the car.

725
00:39:59,577 --> 00:40:00,585
So, it's fixed?

726
00:40:01,834 --> 00:40:03,351
I will, I will bring the car.

727
00:40:04,082 --> 00:40:05,160
All right then, bye.

728
00:40:05,381 --> 00:40:06,389
See you tomorrow.

729
00:40:38,292 --> 00:40:40,314
What's this? 
Is this your Halloween costume?

730
00:40:40,339 --> 00:40:42,565
You need to be dressed to 
kill, even after you are dead.

731
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:44,164
I won't give up that 
easily, you looser.

732
00:40:45,766 --> 00:40:47,820
I don't plan on loosing 
my face in front of her.

733
00:40:47,845 --> 00:40:50,334
Not even in my dreams, 
had I thought that you will bring this.

734
00:40:50,359 --> 00:40:51,367
What's wrong with it?

735
00:40:51,392 --> 00:40:53,405
Anyways, isn't she supposed 
to be my life partner?

736
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:55,053
So she needs to know 
the truth about me.

737
00:40:55,078 --> 00:40:56,994
Isn't the truth a bit too naked?

738
00:40:57,073 --> 00:40:58,081
My dear moron Venkedi,

739
00:40:58,106 --> 00:40:59,887
there's something that 
you don't know about.

740
00:40:59,912 --> 00:41:01,099
Girl's like simplicity.

741
00:41:01,425 --> 00:41:03,040
I will be out taking 
a joyride with her,

742
00:41:03,065 --> 00:41:04,163
- for you to see. 
- Gautham.

743
00:41:04,188 --> 00:41:05,674
Bloody fool.

744
00:41:05,699 --> 00:41:07,296
Did you bring your car?

745
00:41:07,376 --> 00:41:08,454
Of course, yes.

746
00:41:08,479 --> 00:41:11,557
Since, my dad gone out with the Honda 
City, I had to come with this car.

747
00:41:11,638 --> 00:41:13,702
I could call and ask my dad 
to bring the Honda City.

748
00:41:14,105 --> 00:41:15,542
- No, it's alright. 
- My dad's cool.

749
00:41:15,715 --> 00:41:16,770
I will just come now.

750
00:41:16,926 --> 00:41:18,012
Okay.. Okay..

751
00:41:20,007 --> 00:41:22,555
When did that cycle 
got renamed as City?

752
00:41:22,713 --> 00:41:26,188
Listen looser, God has given me 
something he didn't give you.

753
00:41:26,523 --> 00:41:27,885
I know, stinginess.

754
00:41:27,996 --> 00:41:29,985
No, intelligence.

755
00:41:30,198 --> 00:41:32,162
Where to keep these?

756
00:41:32,187 --> 00:41:33,570
You can put it in the boot.

757
00:41:33,609 --> 00:41:34,788
Let me take that.

758
00:41:34,946 --> 00:41:35,954
Seems heavy.

759
00:41:36,117 --> 00:41:38,582
Are those flip down seats, 
your so called boot?

760
00:41:38,765 --> 00:41:40,984
Zip it, and just get the 
stuff inside the car.

761
00:41:41,388 --> 00:41:45,187
Not good for anything 
other than harm.

762
00:41:48,833 --> 00:41:51,490
Nimmy, isn't it great that 
this car has such a feature?

763
00:41:51,515 --> 00:41:53,155
- Shut up.. 
- Don't keep that in the boot.

764
00:41:53,411 --> 00:41:54,528
Keep that on the rear seat.

765
00:41:54,755 --> 00:41:56,215
Don't worry, both are the same.

766
00:41:56,275 --> 00:41:57,799
I will keep those.

767
00:41:57,824 --> 00:42:00,057
- Isn't this the Madhalam? 
- No, Chenda.

768
00:42:00,183 --> 00:42:01,277
Oh, its a Chenda.

769
00:42:01,511 --> 00:42:02,519
You dumbo,

770
00:42:02,674 --> 00:42:04,012
you still don't get it, right?

771
00:42:04,363 --> 00:42:06,647
This is her tactics, 
to make sure that no one else sits

772
00:42:06,672 --> 00:42:08,833
in the rear, and for her to 
sit with me in the front.

773
00:42:08,858 --> 00:42:10,223
So, 
ain't I sitting in the front?

774
00:42:10,348 --> 00:42:11,356
No, your dad.

775
00:42:11,555 --> 00:42:14,211
Weren't you making fun of it calling 
a four wheeled auto rickshaw,

776
00:42:14,404 --> 00:42:16,237
- Now, get off my auto rickshaw. 
- Gautham.

777
00:42:16,262 --> 00:42:17,273
-You get lost.

778
00:42:17,298 --> 00:42:19,155
Please drop these at 
festive collection.

779
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:20,858
- Alright then. 
- Shall we leave?

780
00:42:21,244 --> 00:42:23,105
Gautham, you go ahead, 
I will follow you.

781
00:42:24,258 --> 00:42:26,212
My friend is 
waiting, that's why?

782
00:42:27,007 --> 00:42:28,014
Bye.

783
00:42:28,354 --> 00:42:30,396
Weren't we going together...?

784
00:43:33,298 --> 00:43:34,305
What do you think now?

785
00:43:34,757 --> 00:43:36,223
Haven't I become 
experienced now?

786
00:43:37,139 --> 00:43:38,462
- Wat.... 
- Eh?

787
00:43:39,027 --> 00:43:40,771
To drink, water.

788
00:43:42,505 --> 00:43:43,926
I can't be seen 
with this car now.

789
00:43:43,998 --> 00:43:45,267
I am an experienced driver now.

790
00:43:46,698 --> 00:43:47,706
Listen to your dad.

791
00:43:48,191 --> 00:43:50,973
We bought this car for 125,000.

792
00:43:52,202 --> 00:43:55,713
After paying that much money, how can we 
junk it without using it to it's maximum.

793
00:43:55,879 --> 00:43:58,208
We are not junking 
it, but selling it.

794
00:43:58,233 --> 00:44:02,400
But still, 
125,000 is not a small amount.

795
00:44:02,730 --> 00:44:05,444
Do you know how many zero's 
are there in 125,000?

796
00:44:05,469 --> 00:44:06,712
Didn't you promise me that we

797
00:44:06,737 --> 00:44:07,877
will, once I am experienced?

798
00:44:07,902 --> 00:44:09,428
Now, you are going 
back on your word?

799
00:44:09,539 --> 00:44:11,752
I am not, 
I was just explaining things.

800
00:44:11,777 --> 00:44:13,326
Now, I am going to 
give you my word?

801
00:44:16,816 --> 00:44:18,591
Use it to the maximum.

802
00:44:18,863 --> 00:44:21,513
If anything goes wrong with it, 
we will trade it for a new car.

803
00:44:21,538 --> 00:44:22,791
Dad, please don't,

804
00:44:23,293 --> 00:44:24,683
make a fool out of me.

805
00:44:26,591 --> 00:44:27,746
I am running out of breath.

806
00:44:27,922 --> 00:44:29,360
My tongue is going weak.

807
00:44:31,026 --> 00:44:32,158
Looks like low blood sodium.

808
00:44:33,465 --> 00:44:34,473
I am tired.

809
00:44:34,498 --> 00:44:35,506
Water.

810
00:44:36,310 --> 00:44:37,317
Water.

811
00:44:40,565 --> 00:44:42,217
It's really sweet, have it.

812
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:45,887
I got embarrassed everywhere.

813
00:44:46,129 --> 00:44:49,939
In front of neighbours, 
family and even the girl I loved.

814
00:44:51,597 --> 00:44:53,677
I am thinking of 
fleeing this place.

815
00:44:54,219 --> 00:44:55,862
Will you get high 
if you drink cola?

816
00:44:56,098 --> 00:44:58,555
- If you are really sad, you will. 
- Oh, is it.

817
00:44:59,066 --> 00:45:01,358
Everyone at home, 
loves him more than me.

818
00:45:01,746 --> 00:45:03,136
Him? Who is that?

819
00:45:03,598 --> 00:45:06,120
Everyone calls that 
Nano as Nanappan.

820
00:45:06,683 --> 00:45:08,542
Nanappan!

821
00:45:08,567 --> 00:45:10,553
I am just the driver.

822
00:45:10,674 --> 00:45:12,015
I have had enough.

823
00:45:12,118 --> 00:45:14,451
Can't you tell this to 
your folks and sell it?

824
00:45:14,734 --> 00:45:16,769
Tell them what? 
I have already tried my best.

825
00:45:16,832 --> 00:45:18,740
I see a bright political 
future for my dad.

826
00:45:18,875 --> 00:45:19,882
Going back on promises.

827
00:45:19,952 --> 00:45:21,751
Buttering and diplomacy.

828
00:45:21,924 --> 00:45:23,549
So what did uncle say?

829
00:45:23,574 --> 00:45:24,699
Will sell it is worn off?

830
00:45:24,730 --> 00:45:26,752
Gautham, won't your life 
be also worn off by then?

831
00:45:27,967 --> 00:45:29,240
My life is over. It's over.

832
00:45:29,824 --> 00:45:31,120
My life is screwed.

833
00:45:31,429 --> 00:45:33,820
Gautham, 
don't get too sentimental?

834
00:45:33,887 --> 00:45:35,420
Then, what should I do?

835
00:45:35,944 --> 00:45:38,132
I am going to flee this place. 
I have had enough.

836
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:40,648
I will give you an idea.

837
00:45:40,998 --> 00:45:42,006
What is it?

838
00:45:42,648 --> 00:45:43,718
You better go somewhere.

839
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,814
- Great idea. 
- Don't mess with me.

840
00:45:46,122 --> 00:45:47,576
You are going to go to Munnar.

841
00:45:47,913 --> 00:45:49,713
And we are all coming 
with you as planned.

842
00:45:50,378 --> 00:45:52,266
But, how will we go?

843
00:45:53,941 --> 00:45:56,110
Hey we will go to 
Munnar with Nanappan,

844
00:45:56,416 --> 00:45:57,423
will have a blast.

845
00:45:57,657 --> 00:46:00,267
Will come back with a brilliant 
idea to junk Nanappan.

846
00:46:00,321 --> 00:46:01,329
Awesome.

847
00:46:02,737 --> 00:46:05,174
Then, 
I will be needing a jacket.

848
00:46:05,199 --> 00:46:07,017
- I don't have a jacket. 
- Jacket, for what?

849
00:46:07,042 --> 00:46:08,991
Isn't it really cold in Munnar?

850
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:12,545
Who is taking you there to Munnar? 
You aren't old enough for that.

851
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:14,483
We could drop you at Marine 
drive, on the way.

852
00:46:14,508 --> 00:46:16,257
- She wants to go to Munnar! 
- But...?

853
00:46:16,282 --> 00:46:19,187
- Isn't this going to cost money? 
- Of course, for petrol, food.

854
00:46:19,212 --> 00:46:20,219
We will all need to pool.

855
00:46:20,894 --> 00:46:22,941
We three alone 
can't pull it off.

856
00:46:23,392 --> 00:46:24,812
There is someone else who can.

857
00:46:25,878 --> 00:46:27,378
He will jump in, 
on hearing trip.

858
00:46:27,403 --> 00:46:29,089
And he will take care 
of all the expenses.

859
00:46:29,114 --> 00:46:30,122
Who is that?

860
00:46:30,973 --> 00:46:32,121
He is my cousin.

861
00:46:32,658 --> 00:46:33,666
The name is Sampath.

862
00:46:33,934 --> 00:46:34,942
Sampath?

863
00:46:35,899 --> 00:46:37,728
We can't tolerate 
you, to begin with.

864
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:39,196
That's when you 
bring in your cousin.

865
00:46:39,221 --> 00:46:42,428
I thought, you could go to 
Munnar and solve your issues.

866
00:46:42,453 --> 00:46:45,461
- Stop here, Sampath bro. 
- Venkedi, my boy.

867
00:46:45,845 --> 00:46:47,284
Where will I sit?

868
00:46:47,309 --> 00:46:48,798
- In the rear. 
- Rear. Damn.

869
00:46:48,823 --> 00:46:51,095
- Will we come back with an idea? 
- Definitely.

870
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:52,970
So we all rallied behind 
Venkedi's idea, and

871
00:46:52,995 --> 00:46:55,151
decided to finally 
make that Munnar trip.

872
00:46:55,176 --> 00:46:58,490
Open the windows, 
aren't we going to a cold place?

873
00:46:58,515 --> 00:46:59,528
Oh! Fresh air, fresh air.

874
00:46:59,961 --> 00:47:02,338
I was well planned 
when you called.

875
00:47:02,769 --> 00:47:04,441
That's why I called you itself.

876
00:47:04,549 --> 00:47:08,891
I am sure there is no one else in this 
world, like you to go for this trip.

877
00:47:09,270 --> 00:47:10,345
I am really starving.

878
00:47:10,370 --> 00:47:14,885
I am thinking about stopping and 
having lunch before continuing.

879
00:47:14,949 --> 00:47:16,694
We needn’t stop for lunch.

880
00:47:16,906 --> 00:47:18,812
I have all sort's 
of food in my bag.

881
00:47:22,258 --> 00:47:23,266
Have this banana.

882
00:47:23,967 --> 00:47:25,508
Don't you want it, 
it's really good.

883
00:47:25,548 --> 00:47:27,967
I have Pappada Vada, Rice Flour

884
00:47:27,992 --> 00:47:30,357
Cannoli, Tapioca Chips, have it.

885
00:47:30,612 --> 00:47:31,688
- KFC? 
- KFC!

886
00:47:32,073 --> 00:47:35,017
I have KFC too, 
Kattappana Fried Chips.

887
00:47:38,782 --> 00:47:40,625
Pass it.

888
00:47:40,921 --> 00:47:41,929
Here, hold it.

889
00:47:43,461 --> 00:47:45,859
Come fast, else Sampath 
will have it all by himself.

890
00:47:47,850 --> 00:47:49,025
Step aside, keep these too.

891
00:47:49,050 --> 00:47:50,058
Come, come let's go.

892
00:48:00,921 --> 00:48:03,350
Hey, they tricked you, 
this thing doesn't have a fuel tank.

893
00:48:03,574 --> 00:48:05,759
You fool, 
it's fuel tank is up front.

894
00:48:05,784 --> 00:48:06,792
Hey, move aside.

895
00:48:07,187 --> 00:48:08,195
Don't know a thing.

896
00:48:09,468 --> 00:48:11,935
Oh no, where has it gone, 
it's engine is missing.

897
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:13,121
What, it's engine is missing?

898
00:48:13,146 --> 00:48:15,419
- We came this far without an engine. 
- Didn't I say that

899
00:48:15,444 --> 00:48:17,428
there was something odd 
when we came up that hill.

900
00:48:17,453 --> 00:48:19,078
You morons, 
it's engine is in the rear.

901
00:48:19,103 --> 00:48:20,423
- Oh! Rear engined. 
- Rear engine.

902
00:48:20,514 --> 00:48:21,811
These damn fools.

903
00:48:21,836 --> 00:48:23,329
Hey bro, petrol.

904
00:48:23,354 --> 00:48:24,611
Sampath bro, for how much?

905
00:48:24,636 --> 00:48:25,648
Fill it.

906
00:48:27,027 --> 00:48:28,348
- As much as you want. 
- How much?

907
00:48:28,527 --> 00:48:29,590
- Say thousand. 
- Thousand.

908
00:48:29,615 --> 00:48:30,764
Bro, for a thousand bugs.

909
00:48:31,179 --> 00:48:32,187
Sampath bro.

910
00:48:35,152 --> 00:48:36,168
Sampath bro, the cash.

911
00:48:36,301 --> 00:48:37,381
- Give it. 
- Yeah, the cash.

912
00:48:37,406 --> 00:48:38,414
Just give it.

913
00:48:41,879 --> 00:48:43,528
Damn, we are screwed. 
Where is the beer?

914
00:48:43,591 --> 00:48:44,599
In the boot.

915
00:48:44,848 --> 00:48:45,887
Open the boot.

916
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:47,481
Sir, 
this car doesn’t have a boot.

917
00:48:47,574 --> 00:48:49,785
Boss, they are saying that 
this car doesn’t have a boot.

918
00:48:49,817 --> 00:48:50,825
Boss will let you know.

919
00:48:50,958 --> 00:48:53,505
Sir, we have a few 
beer, that's all.

920
00:48:56,339 --> 00:48:57,347
What a relief?

921
00:48:57,973 --> 00:48:58,980
Beautiful place.

922
00:48:59,488 --> 00:49:00,496
What a breeze?

923
00:49:00,703 --> 00:49:01,710
In the valley.

924
00:49:08,636 --> 00:49:09,644
Close, get closer.

925
00:49:10,187 --> 00:49:11,195
Stop, stop.

926
00:49:11,363 --> 00:49:13,066
Not with the car.

927
00:49:13,288 --> 00:49:14,296
I will stand here.

928
00:49:15,136 --> 00:49:18,890
Ready! One, Two, Three.

929
00:49:19,363 --> 00:49:20,723
- Show me. 
- It came out good.

930
00:49:26,619 --> 00:49:27,627
This is Echo Point.

931
00:49:40,971 --> 00:49:41,979
Hey Gautham.

932
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:47,580
Didn't your dad tell that he will buy 
a new car if anything happens to this?

933
00:49:48,445 --> 00:49:50,125
Why don't we wreck 
this car then?

934
00:49:53,099 --> 00:49:54,244
That's true.

935
00:49:55,704 --> 00:49:56,759
Let's wreck it.

936
00:50:11,337 --> 00:50:12,890
Hey stop, stop.

937
00:50:14,121 --> 00:50:15,128
Isn't this my dad's car?

938
00:50:15,832 --> 00:50:17,707
My dad lost his 125,000.

939
00:50:18,378 --> 00:50:20,050
No, I won't let you 
ruin my dad's cash.

940
00:50:22,668 --> 00:50:24,121
I won't let you ruin it.

941
00:50:24,613 --> 00:50:25,620
That's enough.

942
00:50:25,968 --> 00:50:27,211
That's enough of wrecking.

943
00:50:27,675 --> 00:50:29,029
Clean it, everyone clean it up.

944
00:50:29,270 --> 00:50:30,705
Everyone just 
finish up the beer.

945
00:50:30,911 --> 00:50:32,791
- How will we clean this up? 
- Just drink it up.

946
00:50:33,899 --> 00:50:34,907
His damn idea.

947
00:50:35,190 --> 00:50:36,812
It's stinking with 
the smell of beer.

948
00:50:36,923 --> 00:50:37,931
That's true.

949
00:50:38,854 --> 00:50:39,862
Idiot.

950
00:50:40,269 --> 00:50:41,277
Finish it up.

951
00:50:46,898 --> 00:50:48,164
Damn, even the beer got over.

952
00:50:51,684 --> 00:50:54,078
Hey Venky, please don't sleep.

953
00:50:54,103 --> 00:50:57,277
Who is sleeping, you better don't 
sleep, we are all wide awake here.

954
00:50:57,309 --> 00:50:58,389
You better be.

955
00:50:59,237 --> 00:51:02,141
All of you are high, 
only I am sober.

956
00:51:02,699 --> 00:51:04,020
I haven't had a sip.

957
00:51:11,927 --> 00:51:15,340
I have a small desire, can you please 
overtake that auto rickshaw at least?

958
00:51:15,790 --> 00:51:17,606
Please, I would love to see it.

959
00:51:18,036 --> 00:51:22,107
This can overtake an auto 
rickshaw, I will show it to you.

960
00:51:22,435 --> 00:51:25,508
Hey, watch out, we are going to 
overtake an auto rickshaw. Ready?

961
00:51:25,731 --> 00:51:27,327
Stop, stop the car.

962
00:51:27,502 --> 00:51:31,002
Gauthaman's car is 
chasing an auto rickshaw?

963
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:40,504
Hey, you prick in the auto.

964
00:51:40,999 --> 00:51:44,499
If we can't chase an auto rickshaw, 
then whats the point of we being in a car?

965
00:51:47,053 --> 00:51:48,259
Just wait for it.

966
00:51:48,323 --> 00:51:50,090
His damn auto rickshaw.

967
00:51:52,857 --> 00:51:56,036
Gautham, 
you are a pro driver now.

968
00:51:56,954 --> 00:51:58,490
- Venky. 
- Yeah.

969
00:51:59,015 --> 00:52:00,954
Venky, we lost the brakes.

970
00:52:01,004 --> 00:52:04,872
You are not getting the brake? 
Awesome.

971
00:52:04,897 --> 00:52:08,845
Mission Success. 
We have successfully wrecked this vehicle.

972
00:52:10,926 --> 00:52:13,364
- Hey Venky, we don't have brakes. 
- Don’t have brakes?

973
00:52:13,389 --> 00:52:14,424
No, don't have.

974
00:52:14,449 --> 00:52:15,778
I can't get the brakes.

975
00:52:16,102 --> 00:52:18,019
You might be stamping 
on the wrong thing,

976
00:52:18,044 --> 00:52:20,532
stamp on the middle pedal. 
That's the brake.

977
00:52:23,995 --> 00:52:25,003
It doesn't have brakes.

978
00:52:28,237 --> 00:52:31,561
Here red flag, 
somebody please save us.

979
00:52:36,862 --> 00:52:40,119
Red flag, 
somebody please save us.

980
00:52:57,615 --> 00:52:59,450
What happened?

981
00:52:59,545 --> 00:53:00,631
What is it?

982
00:53:00,989 --> 00:53:03,340
They are gone... 
They are gone....

983
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:06,381
While coming downhill, we couldn't stop. 
Looks like we lost the brake.

984
00:53:06,406 --> 00:53:08,084
That's why we stopped. 
Hey, what is it?

985
00:53:08,109 --> 00:53:09,515
- We have lost 
Sampath bro and Alby.

986
00:53:10,181 --> 00:53:12,556
Hey, what is it that you lost?

987
00:53:13,153 --> 00:53:15,161
Hey, they are high and asleep.

988
00:53:15,241 --> 00:53:17,435
If they ask about Sampath, 
what so I tell them?

989
00:53:17,485 --> 00:53:18,507
- Are you drunk? 
- No bro.

990
00:53:18,766 --> 00:53:20,797
I haven't touched 
it, not even a drop.

991
00:53:21,162 --> 00:53:22,537
I will be right back.

992
00:53:22,607 --> 00:53:24,849
What do I tell, 
if they call from home?

993
00:53:24,974 --> 00:53:28,653
I am going to miss 
you Sampath bro.

994
00:53:28,716 --> 00:53:31,270
Hey Venky, come here.

995
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:34,342
Sampath bro, 
I am going to miss...

996
00:53:35,631 --> 00:53:37,762
Finally, some relief.

997
00:53:37,787 --> 00:53:38,832
Give me that.

998
00:53:39,881 --> 00:53:41,521
- Are you okay now, Venky? 
- Hey, wake up.

999
00:53:42,045 --> 00:53:43,264
He isn't waking up.

1000
00:53:43,295 --> 00:53:44,912
Sampath bro is just awesome.

1001
00:53:44,937 --> 00:53:47,787
He isn't even old enough to drink, 
but still had way too much to drink.

1002
00:53:47,927 --> 00:53:50,693
Sampath is just asleep, 
there is nothing wrong with him, Venky.

1003
00:53:50,929 --> 00:53:53,436
- Sampath bro is just awesome. 
- Don’t cry.....Don’t cry....

1004
00:53:53,461 --> 00:53:54,500
Put him inside.

1005
00:53:54,695 --> 00:53:56,859
- I will fix it. 
- Sampath bro is just awesome.

1006
00:53:59,165 --> 00:54:00,451
Get inside.

1007
00:54:02,224 --> 00:54:03,239
Lie down, be quiet.

1008
00:54:03,349 --> 00:54:04,365
What's wrong?

1009
00:54:04,390 --> 00:54:06,357
Their car doesn't have 
brakes, and they are drunk.

1010
00:54:06,382 --> 00:54:08,554
- Where's his head? 
- They are all bottoms up!

1011
00:54:11,803 --> 00:54:14,240
- Sorry bro. 
- My dear, the weather is really bad here.

1012
00:54:14,748 --> 00:54:16,303
Those sober can't 
drive through here.

1013
00:54:16,396 --> 00:54:18,147
So how can those who 
are drunk like you all.

1014
00:54:18,172 --> 00:54:19,419
- That's true. 
- Are you drunk?

1015
00:54:19,443 --> 00:54:20,467
He isn't.

1016
00:54:20,514 --> 00:54:21,522
What happened then?

1017
00:54:21,553 --> 00:54:24,990
It was all fine, but as we came 
down this hill, we lost our brake.

1018
00:54:25,015 --> 00:54:26,856
It didn't stop, 
even though I tried to brake.

1019
00:54:26,881 --> 00:54:28,475
I then managed to stop somehow.

1020
00:54:28,601 --> 00:54:30,305
- Be quiet. 
- Open the bonnet.

1021
00:54:30,330 --> 00:54:31,337
Yeah sure.

1022
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:34,531
Where are you coming from?

1023
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:35,636
We are coming from Munnar.

1024
00:54:35,661 --> 00:54:36,668
Where to?

1025
00:54:36,693 --> 00:54:37,725
To Ernakulam.

1026
00:54:37,756 --> 00:54:39,443
Looks like you are 
out of brake fluid.

1027
00:54:39,468 --> 00:54:41,076
It's better that 
you show it a garage

1028
00:54:41,101 --> 00:54:42,129
tomorrow before leaving.

1029
00:54:42,171 --> 00:54:43,194
Bro, that's.

1030
00:54:43,523 --> 00:54:45,092
Wasn't there a lot 
of twists and turns,

1031
00:54:45,357 --> 00:54:46,638
that’s how you lost the brakes.

1032
00:54:47,053 --> 00:54:50,498
We need to leave tonight 
itself, tomorrow we need to...

1033
00:54:50,607 --> 00:54:52,724
From where are you going to 
find a mechanic, tonight.

1034
00:54:52,749 --> 00:54:55,035
In this condition, 
you wouldn't make it home, in this car.

1035
00:54:55,997 --> 00:54:57,912
It's better that 
you don't leave.

1036
00:54:57,951 --> 00:55:01,255
One guy just left now, without listening, 
need to wait and see what happens to him.

1037
00:55:01,959 --> 00:55:05,115
We have nothing to gain, 
by making you stay back.

1038
00:55:05,443 --> 00:55:08,904
All of those who had dinner from here, 
and continued with their journey,

1039
00:55:08,929 --> 00:55:11,962
despite our advise, they all end 
up in the next day's newspaper.

1040
00:55:12,786 --> 00:55:14,311
It's better that 
you don't leave now.

1041
00:55:14,897 --> 00:55:16,740
Hey, the brake fluid is clogged.

1042
00:55:16,803 --> 00:55:18,904
The brake fluid is jammed.

1043
00:55:18,929 --> 00:55:20,568
Hey bro, we will stay back.

1044
00:55:20,601 --> 00:55:22,039
That's better.

1045
00:55:22,274 --> 00:55:25,935
Lose of face, 
love and money....Hmm...

1046
00:55:30,164 --> 00:55:31,172
You just wait and watch,

1047
00:55:31,861 --> 00:55:33,493
you will be out of my home soon.

1048
00:55:34,633 --> 00:55:36,968
You won't get to be this 
arrogant for much long.

1049
00:55:37,539 --> 00:55:38,968
You better watch out!

1050
00:55:50,937 --> 00:55:52,936
My dear, don’t leave. 
I have got something to say.

1051
00:55:52,961 --> 00:55:53,969
Stop.

1052
00:55:54,077 --> 00:55:55,101
The brake got fixed.

1053
00:55:55,133 --> 00:55:57,544
That's what happen, 
when you cross paths with nice people.

1054
00:55:58,459 --> 00:55:59,906
Don't wear it off again.

1055
00:55:59,931 --> 00:56:00,939
What happened?

1056
00:56:01,071 --> 00:56:02,750
We really didn't have 
brakes yesterday.

1057
00:56:02,775 --> 00:56:05,352
And that was a blessing in disguise. 
It stopped you from leaving.

1058
00:56:05,377 --> 00:56:06,606
Would have reached home then.

1059
00:56:06,631 --> 00:56:10,752
That Auto rickshaw guy that 
left before you, a tree

1060
00:56:10,777 --> 00:56:14,422
fell and both his vehicle 
and him are no more.

1061
00:56:14,992 --> 00:56:17,436
Your car broke down 
at the right time.

1062
00:56:17,898 --> 00:56:18,906
Just think about it,

1063
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:23,027
had you guys too left, 
what would have happened.

1064
00:56:23,178 --> 00:56:27,060
You guys are lucky that your 
car stopped at the right place.

1065
00:56:28,010 --> 00:56:32,475
It was the first and last time, 
that Nanappan ever got cranky with me.

1066
00:56:32,551 --> 00:56:35,520
When my last-ditch effort to 
avoid him from life also failed,

1067
00:56:35,545 --> 00:56:37,107
I realised something,

1068
00:56:37,132 --> 00:56:40,562
my life is going to get 
burned in this 700 cc.

1069
00:56:40,587 --> 00:56:45,909
All the festivals and seasons 
came and went thrice after that.

1070
00:56:46,311 --> 00:56:52,108
The wheel of time, was spinning faster 
than Nanappan's fuel price could rise,

1071
00:56:52,506 --> 00:56:55,935
bringing it to the Residential 
Associations 15th anniversary.

1072
00:56:58,234 --> 00:57:00,689
Mom tried out new 
experiments, in Thiruvathira.

1073
00:57:02,031 --> 00:57:05,712
Dad gracefully welcomed the 3 
new Grey hair's in his mustache.

1074
00:57:06,882 --> 00:57:12,180
Even in the ripe age of 82, granny found 
ways to keep herself busy and enjoy.

1075
00:57:12,812 --> 00:57:15,944
Kichu and friends, 
started grooving to new tracks.

1076
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,326
Venkedi and me were at final 
year, with a

1077
00:57:19,351 --> 00:57:21,748
project that we were 
absolutely clueless about.

1078
00:57:21,936 --> 00:57:24,540
Even though time's and 
timepieces's had changed,

1079
00:57:24,565 --> 00:57:26,843
Nanappan and me were 
still stuck together.

1080
00:57:28,952 --> 00:57:30,452
Gautham, my dear,

1081
00:57:31,092 --> 00:57:33,568
will anyone of you, 
get a vehicle and

1082
00:57:33,593 --> 00:57:36,521
go to Habib's place and give 
the pots and some money..

1083
00:57:36,952 --> 00:57:38,522
Sure uncle, I will take my car.

1084
00:57:38,902 --> 00:57:40,942
Which car do you plan to take? 
Does it have diesel?

1085
00:57:41,092 --> 00:57:42,917
Don't you have exams? 
Go and prepare for that.

1086
00:57:42,942 --> 00:57:43,989
Fine, I will.

1087
00:57:44,530 --> 00:57:45,796
My dear, you please go...

1088
00:57:45,821 --> 00:57:46,946
Just go with Nanappan and...

1089
00:57:47,138 --> 00:57:48,146
Please.

1090
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:50,027
Please go my dear.

1091
00:57:50,484 --> 00:57:51,890
No need to push him, he will go.

1092
00:57:52,964 --> 00:57:55,634
The good things about Nano is 
that, If you put fuel

1093
00:57:55,659 --> 00:57:57,824
for 300 Rupees, 
you can cover 600 KM's with that.

1094
00:57:57,849 --> 00:57:59,989
- 600! 
- Almost 600.

1095
00:58:00,467 --> 00:58:01,827
- 600? 
- Around 60.

1096
00:58:01,852 --> 00:58:03,889
- I am not coming anywhere. 
- You better come.

1097
00:58:03,921 --> 00:58:04,929
- Leave me. 
- Just come.

1098
00:58:04,954 --> 00:58:06,016
Stop fooling around.

1099
00:58:06,330 --> 00:58:08,610
Won't even let to sit in 
peace, his dad's damn pot.

1100
00:58:17,563 --> 00:58:20,000
Hey Gautham, 
I was just thinking, how about

1101
00:58:20,025 --> 00:58:22,161
we rent out this car 
to some caterers.

1102
00:58:22,186 --> 00:58:24,016
I have an even better idea.

1103
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:27,543
How about selling you 
off to child traffickers?

1104
00:58:29,519 --> 00:58:33,001
You needn't pull my leg, just 
because, I don’t have facial hair.

1105
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:38,471
My mustache slowly is 
connecting to my beard.

1106
00:58:41,144 --> 00:58:43,402
What are you laughing about? 
Nothing much to laugh about.

1107
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:44,669
Who is that?

1108
00:58:44,694 --> 00:58:45,702
Stop there!

1109
00:58:45,949 --> 00:58:47,262
Stop the bike, you idiot.

1110
00:58:49,716 --> 00:58:52,341
You are the first person I am 
going to hit after my 10th grade.

1111
00:58:52,366 --> 00:58:53,530
Stop it..Stop right now.

1112
00:58:53,555 --> 00:58:54,906
Chase, chase, chase.

1113
00:58:54,931 --> 00:58:56,523
He could be some chain snatcher.

1114
00:58:56,548 --> 00:58:58,156
Overtake him.

1115
00:58:58,181 --> 00:59:00,681
Hook him from the left 
and stick him to the wall.

1116
00:59:01,645 --> 00:59:03,418
Stop. Do you seem him get 
away, you fool.

1117
00:59:03,443 --> 00:59:05,910
You fool, his engine is 
half the size of our's.

1118
00:59:05,935 --> 00:59:07,013
Overtake him.

1119
00:59:07,718 --> 00:59:08,828
Faster. He is getting away.

1120
00:59:08,853 --> 00:59:12,685
There he is. Got him, got him.

1121
00:59:13,087 --> 00:59:14,751
Hey Shaji, come fast.

1122
00:59:18,473 --> 00:59:20,754
How dare you ride off, 
after crashing into us?

1123
00:59:20,779 --> 00:59:22,613
- Gautham, go easy on him. 
- Mom.

1124
00:59:48,207 --> 00:59:49,926
Why didn't you stop?

1125
00:59:49,951 --> 00:59:52,023
How dare you run your mouth, 
after crashing into me?

1126
00:59:52,048 --> 00:59:53,515
Is that how you want to play it?

1127
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:54,571
You break my side mirror,

1128
00:59:54,596 --> 00:59:57,004
then you slap me and now you 
are trying to justify yourself.

1129
00:59:57,331 --> 00:59:58,444
Didn't you crash into her?

1130
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:00,378
We all saw it.

1131
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:01,547
"We"? Who all are "we"?

1132
01:00:01,848 --> 01:00:03,879
That's us. We all saw.

1133
01:00:04,262 --> 01:00:07,430
Bro, she broke our side mirror, and then 
didn't stop, no matter how many times

1134
01:00:07,544 --> 01:00:10,551
we honked. That's how we got to this 
intersection, and finally cornered her.

1135
01:00:10,576 --> 01:00:13,312
If she had any decency, 
would we have needed to do any of this.

1136
01:00:13,376 --> 01:00:15,166
You can ask my friend. 
Hey Venkedi come here.

1137
01:00:15,191 --> 01:00:16,644
Won't your friend 
speak in favour of

1138
01:00:16,669 --> 01:00:18,403
you. He saw everything 
from the front seat.

1139
01:00:18,434 --> 01:00:20,786
He is the wishnes... Witness.

1140
01:00:20,811 --> 01:00:21,819
Ask him?

1141
01:00:21,844 --> 01:00:24,002
Hey, isn't she the one who 
crashed into us? Tell them.

1142
01:00:24,027 --> 01:00:25,889
- Looks like he was sleeping. 
- Are you hurt?

1143
01:00:25,914 --> 01:00:26,922
My hand's are aching.

1144
01:00:26,947 --> 01:00:28,807
Somebody please get some water.

1145
01:00:28,832 --> 01:00:31,090
What all are you looking at 
when someone is about to die?

1146
01:00:31,115 --> 01:00:32,241
Get her some water.

1147
01:00:32,266 --> 01:00:33,478
You moron, what are you doing?

1148
01:00:33,503 --> 01:00:34,698
My hands are really paining.

1149
01:00:34,723 --> 01:00:36,351
That's because your 
hands are restless.

1150
01:00:36,376 --> 01:00:38,570
Don't try acting smart 
after causing all of this.

1151
01:00:38,595 --> 01:00:40,321
If you dare touch us, 
things will get ugly.

1152
01:00:40,346 --> 01:00:42,806
Yes, things will get ugly, 
that’s what even I have got to say.

1153
01:00:42,850 --> 01:00:44,280
My crew will be here.

1154
01:00:44,397 --> 01:00:46,365
- Which crew? 
- Our neighbourhood crew.

1155
01:00:46,538 --> 01:00:48,684
Yeah, our crew will 
come, we are not to

1156
01:00:48,709 --> 01:00:50,723
be taken easily. 
Got that, you fatso.

1157
01:00:50,748 --> 01:00:51,756
Hey, I am an assole.

1158
01:00:51,802 --> 01:00:53,950
If you are an assole, 
how does it affect us.

1159
01:00:54,374 --> 01:00:59,155
We are only happy about it. So no one 
has any problem, let's all go home.

1160
01:00:59,180 --> 01:01:01,738
- Hey, do you have a problem? 
- She does.

1161
01:01:01,763 --> 01:01:03,084
Wow, 
the brakes worked this time.

1162
01:01:03,109 --> 01:01:04,151
What's going on here?

1163
01:01:04,176 --> 01:01:06,146
Gautham, I will go and get 
a lawyer for your bail.

1164
01:01:06,171 --> 01:01:07,933
Catch him.

1165
01:01:08,919 --> 01:01:11,204
Sir, he tried killing this 
girl by running over her.

1166
01:01:12,566 --> 01:01:13,683
- Is that true? 
- Yes sir.

1167
01:01:13,708 --> 01:01:15,232
Come her. Are you drunk?

1168
01:01:15,257 --> 01:01:16,655
- No Sir. 
- Blow into this.

1169
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:18,559
- Don't lie. 
- They are the one's who hit her.

1170
01:01:19,754 --> 01:01:21,676
Sir, let me explain.

1171
01:01:23,020 --> 01:01:26,520
She overtook from the left 
side, isn't that wrong?

1172
01:01:26,668 --> 01:01:28,688
- No sir. 
- Look at that mirror.

1173
01:01:28,713 --> 01:01:33,611
While we were coming from there, 
she came crashed our mirror and sped off.

1174
01:01:33,747 --> 01:01:36,075
- We were honking asking her to stop. 
- No sir.

1175
01:01:36,543 --> 01:01:38,895
- Didn't we honk? 
- It's not like that.

1176
01:01:39,283 --> 01:01:42,691
You know what sir, she put the right turn 
indicator and turned towards the left side.

1177
01:01:42,716 --> 01:01:44,767
She herself crashed into 
our vehicle and fell down.

1178
01:01:44,792 --> 01:01:45,965
Sir, these guys are lying,

1179
01:01:45,990 --> 01:01:47,420
she can't move her hand.

1180
01:01:47,446 --> 01:01:49,463
Not only that sir, 
they wrecked my new bike, just

1181
01:01:49,488 --> 01:01:51,319
off the showroom floor, 
yet to be registered.

1182
01:01:51,344 --> 01:01:53,714
Do you hit, yet to be 
registered vehicles on purpose?

1183
01:01:53,739 --> 01:01:56,053
Sir, when we hit, 
we don't check whether it's

1184
01:01:56,078 --> 01:01:57,702
yet to be registered or 
old, we just hit.

1185
01:01:57,727 --> 01:02:00,559
Let me just hit... Enough of it, 
we need to take her to the hospital.

1186
01:02:00,584 --> 01:02:02,082
Sir, won't you take 
her to hospital?

1187
01:02:02,107 --> 01:02:05,676
Not me, take her in your car. 
Get her in, you too.

1188
01:02:05,701 --> 01:02:09,529
Get in the car, all of you.

1189
01:02:09,554 --> 01:02:10,945
And you in this car.

1190
01:02:10,970 --> 01:02:15,739
Are you all happy now that I 
am bring sent to the prison.

1191
01:02:15,764 --> 01:02:17,749
So, there's no one to 
come from your home?

1192
01:02:17,774 --> 01:02:19,165
- No, my dad's abroad. 
- Oh, is it?

1193
01:02:19,190 --> 01:02:21,243
- And, what do you do? 
- I am studying architecture.

1194
01:02:21,268 --> 01:02:22,943
What has she got 
this much to say?

1195
01:02:23,054 --> 01:02:25,445
She is scheming ways 
to get you locked up.

1196
01:02:25,470 --> 01:02:27,283
Stop it. She is the one 
who crashed into us.

1197
01:02:27,308 --> 01:02:31,076
Yes, she did, but then didn't 
you chase and crash into her?

1198
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:33,941
- But, didn't you ask to chase her? 
- Congratulations.

1199
01:02:34,703 --> 01:02:36,265
- Why sir? 
- Did he become a father?

1200
01:02:36,290 --> 01:02:37,540
You broke that girls hand and..

1201
01:02:38,194 --> 01:02:40,217
It broke, 
she totally deserves it.

1202
01:02:40,441 --> 01:02:42,281
- That's good. 
- Come, the boss is calling you.

1203
01:02:42,729 --> 01:02:43,885
Will we get arrested sir?

1204
01:02:43,910 --> 01:02:45,365
And you don't know 
them from before.

1205
01:02:45,390 --> 01:02:46,515
May I come in sir?

1206
01:02:46,540 --> 01:02:48,341
Does this look like a 
school, come inside.

1207
01:02:49,174 --> 01:02:51,407
Look at the innocence 
drooling off their faces?

1208
01:02:52,198 --> 01:02:53,314
Yes good morning.

1209
01:02:53,339 --> 01:02:58,600
Catch him, don’t let him go. 
He is an escaped convict.

1210
01:02:58,625 --> 01:02:59,645
Damn.

1211
01:02:59,670 --> 01:03:01,154
Shit, just missed him. Sorry.

1212
01:03:01,179 --> 01:03:02,220
Just miss.

1213
01:03:02,601 --> 01:03:04,127
Hey, 
couldn't you have missed him.

1214
01:03:04,152 --> 01:03:05,786
It happened all too fast for me.

1215
01:03:06,448 --> 01:03:08,721
If you want I, 
no we could go and catch him.

1216
01:03:08,868 --> 01:03:11,105
No need, 
you have got a lot to do here.

1217
01:03:11,272 --> 01:03:14,464
This girls hand broke, 
due to your death race.

1218
01:03:14,506 --> 01:03:16,063
So, what should we do next?

1219
01:03:17,337 --> 01:03:18,671
Do we need to go to the station?

1220
01:03:18,708 --> 01:03:19,716
Or compromise?

1221
01:03:20,452 --> 01:03:22,627
Sir, if she pays for our 
broken mirror, we will

1222
01:03:22,652 --> 01:03:24,554
get going. 
We don't want to press charges.

1223
01:03:26,330 --> 01:03:28,008
My dear, 
you are ready to press charges.

1224
01:03:28,743 --> 01:03:29,751
I am ready sir.

1225
01:03:29,776 --> 01:03:30,784
- Subash. 
- Yes.

1226
01:03:34,090 --> 01:03:35,266
- My dear Gautham. 
- Sir.

1227
01:03:35,461 --> 01:03:37,851
You stalked and chased 
the girl name Kalyani,

1228
01:03:37,876 --> 01:03:40,895
and tried to kill 
her by running her

1229
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:43,010
over with your car, 
and in front of the

1230
01:03:43,035 --> 01:03:46,180
public, 
abused the above mentioned girl.

1231
01:03:46,205 --> 01:03:50,058
If I charge such a case, you will be 
locked up for a minimum of ten years.

1232
01:03:50,083 --> 01:03:51,914
Sir, he was the one who was 
driving, it's his

1233
01:03:51,939 --> 01:03:53,705
car, I was riding 
shotgun, and I was wearing

1234
01:03:53,730 --> 01:03:55,579
my seat belt too. 
I didn't do anything, you can

1235
01:03:55,604 --> 01:03:57,334
check with the girl. 
I don't know anything.

1236
01:03:57,359 --> 01:03:58,792
So he will go in, not you.

1237
01:03:58,817 --> 01:03:59,825
Thank you sir.

1238
01:04:00,153 --> 01:04:01,559
- I will get a lawyer. 
- You Brutus.

1239
01:04:01,670 --> 01:04:03,359
Sir, so what about 
this hag slapping me?

1240
01:04:03,575 --> 01:04:05,558
Those are trivial issues.

1241
01:04:05,658 --> 01:04:10,226
Then, even for you addressing her as a 
hag, I can charge a case against you.

1242
01:04:10,316 --> 01:04:12,220
Haven't you heard, 
"Woman Empowerment"?

1243
01:04:13,387 --> 01:04:15,753
So, what's your decision? 
How do you

1244
01:04:15,778 --> 01:04:17,707
want the case? 
Settlement or compromise?

1245
01:04:17,732 --> 01:04:19,788
- Aren't both the same? 
- Keep quiet, he is a fool.

1246
01:04:19,813 --> 01:04:22,423
We prefer settlement, 
because we are people friendly.

1247
01:04:22,448 --> 01:04:23,676
Definitely.

1248
01:04:23,701 --> 01:04:24,709
Say it.

1249
01:04:25,595 --> 01:04:26,603
- Sir. 
- Yes.

1250
01:04:30,917 --> 01:04:33,028
- Compromise. 
- Subash, read it out loud.

1251
01:04:33,053 --> 01:04:36,444
Compromise deed. Both parties agree 
that, till such time that Miss Kalyani's

1252
01:04:36,469 --> 01:04:40,682
broken hand is healed, all her hospital 
procedure's will be overseen by Gautham.

1253
01:04:40,707 --> 01:04:44,972
Ramendran, and the damage done to Gautham 
Ramendran's car will be fixed by Miss.

1254
01:04:44,997 --> 01:04:50,383
Kalyani; in the presence of south station 
inspector Dundu Francis. Name. Signed.

1255
01:04:50,979 --> 01:04:53,368
You will learn to be punctual, 
when cops get involved.

1256
01:04:53,870 --> 01:04:55,009
Hello.

1257
01:04:55,034 --> 01:04:57,109
Are you going on a 
road trip or what?

1258
01:04:57,937 --> 01:05:01,486
I thought I will dress decently, 
since we are going to the hospital.

1259
01:05:02,133 --> 01:05:04,030
Are you going grocery shopping?

1260
01:05:05,783 --> 01:05:07,881
What is it that you 
guy's are doing?

1261
01:05:08,015 --> 01:05:10,158
- You hand.. 
- Get off me.

1262
01:05:10,269 --> 01:05:12,912
It's only because of that 
Inspector, that I am getting in your

1263
01:05:12,937 --> 01:05:15,327
crappy car, else I could have 
gone in some auto rickshaw.

1264
01:05:15,537 --> 01:05:16,944
Hey listen Kallu, we just..

1265
01:05:16,969 --> 01:05:18,584
Kallu, who is Kallu!

1266
01:05:18,796 --> 01:05:23,071
Listen, I only need a driver to get to 
the hospital, and don't need a bodyguard.

1267
01:05:25,236 --> 01:05:26,542
Open the door.

1268
01:05:26,620 --> 01:05:29,053
What, bodyguard! 
You are on your own now.

1269
01:05:37,647 --> 01:05:39,310
What are you waiting for?

1270
01:05:41,686 --> 01:05:46,485
So Nanappan contributed one more person 
to suck the blood out of my life.

1271
01:05:46,676 --> 01:05:48,049
Biker Vampire.

1272
01:05:48,339 --> 01:05:52,312
From then on, for me it was 
sleepless nights, sorry days.

1273
01:05:52,484 --> 01:05:54,504
Dude, I am done.

1274
01:05:54,529 --> 01:05:57,457
She calls up early in the morning 
and order's me to come with the car.

1275
01:05:59,050 --> 01:06:01,293
Hello. I could manage it, 
if I was to take her to the

1276
01:06:01,318 --> 01:06:03,585
hospital alone. 
But that alone is not enough for her.

1277
01:06:03,610 --> 01:06:05,601
- Need to go to that hospital. 
Appointments at 10.

1278
01:06:05,768 --> 01:06:07,487
This early!

1279
01:06:07,545 --> 01:06:09,640
A tornado would have 
completed the picture.

1280
01:06:09,965 --> 01:06:11,070
Hey.

1281
01:06:11,198 --> 01:06:13,223
It's the Biker Vampire, 
I won't pick up.

1282
01:06:13,248 --> 01:06:15,253
She want's to assign 
me with the next task.

1283
01:06:15,278 --> 01:06:16,639
Couldn't you fixed this earlier?

1284
01:06:16,811 --> 01:06:19,082
- I will hit you this. 
- I dare you to.

1285
01:06:19,719 --> 01:06:21,804
Hospital or police station, 
what is it going to be.

1286
01:06:21,970 --> 01:06:23,231
Hospital.

1287
01:06:23,796 --> 01:06:27,069
I did her entire grocery shopping. 
Can't take it anymore.

1288
01:06:27,094 --> 01:06:28,818
No, don't.

1289
01:06:28,986 --> 01:06:31,542
Stop, could you please 
open the car door.

1290
01:06:31,567 --> 01:06:32,703
No, I can't.

1291
01:06:35,341 --> 01:06:37,305
I will make you pay for this.

1292
01:06:37,524 --> 01:06:38,722
You can't!

1293
01:06:50,464 --> 01:06:52,979
You will suffer for this.

1294
01:06:56,857 --> 01:07:00,841
Mom, where is Nanappan's key?

1295
01:07:00,866 --> 01:07:02,801
It should be there somewhere. 
Just look around.

1296
01:07:02,826 --> 01:07:03,896
Mom.

1297
01:07:03,921 --> 01:07:05,273
I am tired of this boy.

1298
01:07:05,298 --> 01:07:06,975
What is it?

1299
01:07:07,042 --> 01:07:08,050
Where did you keep it?

1300
01:07:08,587 --> 01:07:09,594
Move.

1301
01:07:10,437 --> 01:07:11,444
I am running late.

1302
01:07:11,644 --> 01:07:12,652
Hold it.

1303
01:07:12,965 --> 01:07:14,015
How's this possible?

1304
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:16,478
- Have your breakfast and go. 
- I will have it later.

1305
01:07:16,503 --> 01:07:19,769
Dad, move, move, move...

1306
01:07:21,089 --> 01:07:23,282
- What is this? 
- I was giving him a bath.

1307
01:07:23,307 --> 01:07:24,655
What are you doing?

1308
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:26,455
Dad, have you ever given 
me a bath like this?

1309
01:07:27,542 --> 01:07:28,808
Where are you rushing to?

1310
01:07:29,909 --> 01:07:30,917
Get out of my way.

1311
01:07:45,222 --> 01:07:46,230
Where?

1312
01:07:46,871 --> 01:07:47,879
Come, get in.

1313
01:07:57,215 --> 01:07:58,734
Could you please 
close that door?

1314
01:08:01,569 --> 01:08:02,980
With this hand?

1315
01:08:06,392 --> 01:08:07,992
Shouldn't move your 
other hand at all.

1316
01:08:08,055 --> 01:08:09,630
You can have that 
too plastered soon.

1317
01:08:09,655 --> 01:08:10,724
Pure trouble.

1318
01:08:11,042 --> 01:08:12,050
I don't want to hear you.

1319
01:08:12,456 --> 01:08:15,340
Who is talking to you anyway?

1320
01:08:16,737 --> 01:08:18,253
Can you please go fast?

1321
01:08:18,782 --> 01:08:20,193
This car will only 
travel slowly.

1322
01:08:23,198 --> 01:08:24,568
Already half an hour late.

1323
01:08:27,394 --> 01:08:28,927
Damn, my hands hurt.

1324
01:08:28,952 --> 01:08:30,706
That's normal when you 
go over speed bumps.

1325
01:08:32,620 --> 01:08:34,536
Kalyani's driver, 
please pay this bill.

1326
01:08:34,717 --> 01:08:35,896
Driver?

1327
01:08:42,571 --> 01:08:43,579
Isn't it 800?

1328
01:08:44,085 --> 01:08:45,093
Here.

1329
01:08:46,550 --> 01:08:47,558
Let's go.

1330
01:08:47,732 --> 01:08:49,109
I just would like to know,

1331
01:08:49,420 --> 01:08:51,185
How many times did you 
watch Erin Brockovich?

1332
01:09:11,829 --> 01:09:13,292
Wow, look who is here?

1333
01:09:13,964 --> 01:09:15,129
Nair, is that you?

1334
01:09:15,660 --> 01:09:18,722
Diwakaran, you should be on your 
way back after selling all the milk.

1335
01:09:18,759 --> 01:09:20,503
Is your dad and 
that cycle twins?

1336
01:09:21,995 --> 01:09:23,081
Don't go there.

1337
01:09:23,283 --> 01:09:24,909
That cycle is as old 
as my grandfather.

1338
01:09:25,903 --> 01:09:27,270
So it's family heirloom.

1339
01:09:27,295 --> 01:09:29,015
- Is Nandini, your cow fine?

1340
01:09:29,081 --> 01:09:30,089
Who is that?

1341
01:09:30,128 --> 01:09:31,666
-Yes she is fine.

1342
01:09:31,691 --> 01:09:32,698
It's that Biker Vampire.

1343
01:09:33,028 --> 01:09:38,222
In this whole village, 
only you Diwakar has got pure milk?

1344
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:41,581
Even though this society 
has got adulterated,

1345
01:09:42,448 --> 01:09:44,075
Diwakar can't be like that.

1346
01:09:54,963 --> 01:09:56,325
This scene is not there.

1347
01:09:56,496 --> 01:09:58,736
Is that all, I thought he is 
going to be a mean villain?

1348
01:09:58,761 --> 01:10:01,050
- Anirudhan. 
- Dad, dad.

1349
01:10:03,338 --> 01:10:05,437
Anirudhan... Anirudhan...

1350
01:10:07,487 --> 01:10:10,558
- What happened? Is he over? 
- Someone get a metal key fast.

1351
01:10:10,798 --> 01:10:14,298
- I have a key. 
- Dad's not waking up.

1352
01:10:14,323 --> 01:10:16,362
Somebody get some water fast.

1353
01:10:16,387 --> 01:10:17,780
Will someone call an Ambulance?

1354
01:10:18,284 --> 01:10:20,049
- Anirudhan. 
- Uncle, what will we do now.

1355
01:10:20,134 --> 01:10:22,822
- Hey, go and get your car. 
- My car keys are locked in his hands.

1356
01:10:22,847 --> 01:10:24,487
Someone please get a car.

1357
01:10:24,731 --> 01:10:26,880
Somebody bring a car, please.

1358
01:10:27,177 --> 01:10:28,938
- Anirudha..Anirudhaa.. 
- I will get the car.

1359
01:10:31,577 --> 01:10:32,585
I will get the car.

1360
01:10:34,003 --> 01:10:35,011
Our car?

1361
01:10:35,136 --> 01:10:38,058
We will take our car, you go and 
bring Kichu's dad to the entrance.

1362
01:10:45,648 --> 01:10:47,374
This road might be blocked.

1363
01:10:47,399 --> 01:10:49,305
- Alby, 
he is not opening his eye's.

1364
01:10:55,133 --> 01:10:57,860
There's a shortcut through which 
only Auto rickshaw's can pass.

1365
01:10:58,056 --> 01:10:59,063
- Where? 
- Through there.

1366
01:11:02,219 --> 01:11:03,248
- Which one? 
- This one.

1367
01:11:03,273 --> 01:11:04,929
- This left? 
- Yes, through here.

1368
01:11:05,010 --> 01:11:06,127
- He is not moving.

1369
01:11:06,384 --> 01:11:08,086
- You please don't worry.

1370
01:11:09,420 --> 01:11:10,460
Bro..

1371
01:11:10,485 --> 01:11:11,493
Bro.

1372
01:11:11,738 --> 01:11:12,894
Honey.

1373
01:11:13,110 --> 01:11:14,550
Through this pocket road.

1374
01:11:14,583 --> 01:11:16,042
Gautham, pull over to the side.

1375
01:11:29,587 --> 01:11:30,595
- Open it. 
- Call them.

1376
01:11:31,024 --> 01:11:32,328
Gautham, get a stretcher.

1377
01:11:33,614 --> 01:11:34,638
We need a stretcher.

1378
01:11:35,770 --> 01:11:36,849
Hey, lay him down.

1379
01:11:36,874 --> 01:11:38,061
- Lay him here. 
- Be careful.

1380
01:11:39,022 --> 01:11:40,483
- Okay bro, keep moving. 
- Hurry up.

1381
01:11:49,710 --> 01:11:50,718
Uncle.

1382
01:11:51,482 --> 01:11:52,944
Dad, 
he has been taken to the ICU.

1383
01:11:52,969 --> 01:11:54,006
Did the doctor check him?

1384
01:12:02,738 --> 01:12:06,027
At times, I feel that Nanappan 
isn't that big a trouble maker.

1385
01:12:13,878 --> 01:12:16,604
It's not just a 
feeling, it's a fact.

1386
01:12:27,210 --> 01:12:29,452
Kichu don't cry like this, 
let me get some water.

1387
01:12:29,477 --> 01:12:30,788
Why are you crying like this?

1388
01:12:30,819 --> 01:12:31,943
Nothing happened for that.

1389
01:12:32,701 --> 01:12:34,343
Isn't this common 
for those with fits?

1390
01:12:34,443 --> 01:12:36,663
She got scared, 
she is really sensitive.

1391
01:12:36,975 --> 01:12:38,919
When you have really 
nice brothers like this,

1392
01:12:38,944 --> 01:12:40,304
why do you have to be scared?

1393
01:12:40,412 --> 01:12:42,171
- Thanks. 
- Please sign here.

1394
01:12:48,062 --> 01:12:49,099
- How much? 
- 35 rupees.

1395
01:12:52,514 --> 01:12:54,901
Nurse, do you have any 
injection to make them stop cry?

1396
01:12:54,926 --> 01:12:56,312
Don't you that facility here?

1397
01:12:57,334 --> 01:12:59,342
Sister, isn't it enough 
that someone signs for it.

1398
01:12:59,367 --> 01:13:00,375
Yeah.

1399
01:13:00,888 --> 01:13:03,396
Hey you, are you trying 
to cheat me or what?

1400
01:13:03,421 --> 01:13:04,567
Your next patients here.

1401
01:13:04,592 --> 01:13:06,138
Hey, you itself.

1402
01:13:06,163 --> 01:13:07,412
How many time's did I call you?

1403
01:13:07,437 --> 01:13:09,748
I knew it then itself that 
you aren't responsible at all.

1404
01:13:09,772 --> 01:13:11,639
- You broke my hand and my bike.. 
- Keep quiet.

1405
01:13:11,742 --> 01:13:14,007
This is a hospital. 
You can't make noise over here.

1406
01:13:14,092 --> 01:13:15,663
Gautham, 
I have told you many times, we

1407
01:13:15,688 --> 01:13:17,919
need not have anything 
to do with her.

1408
01:13:17,944 --> 01:13:18,952
Look at her carefully,

1409
01:13:18,977 --> 01:13:20,600
you can make it out 
that she is a crook.

1410
01:13:20,682 --> 01:13:22,284
Today he plaster 
is on this hand,

1411
01:13:22,309 --> 01:13:23,716
yesterday it was 
on the other hand.

1412
01:13:23,741 --> 01:13:25,272
Tomorrow it will 
be on her forehead,

1413
01:13:25,297 --> 01:13:27,385
and the day after, 
she will cover her entire body,

1414
01:13:27,410 --> 01:13:29,375
like, THE MUMMY and will 
continue to cheat us.

1415
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:30,446
- Silence. 
- You shut up.

1416
01:13:31,725 --> 01:13:32,732
What is it?

1417
01:13:33,154 --> 01:13:34,162
Sorry sister.

1418
01:13:34,515 --> 01:13:36,428
Sorry Kichu, 
your bro got a bit emotional.

1419
01:13:41,701 --> 01:13:44,358
Why is your friend, overreacting? 
How many time's did I call you?

1420
01:13:44,452 --> 01:13:47,794
One minute. Kichu, didn't the 
nurse tell you that it's all fine.

1421
01:13:47,819 --> 01:13:49,319
Then, 
why are you crying like this?

1422
01:13:49,344 --> 01:13:50,839
It's not like, 
there's nothing wrong.

1423
01:13:50,864 --> 01:13:52,973
Because, he got here on 
time, there's nothing wrong.

1424
01:13:52,998 --> 01:13:54,036
Let me just comfort her?

1425
01:13:54,061 --> 01:13:55,706
- Don't we have to show my hand? 
- What?

1426
01:13:55,731 --> 01:13:58,621
Hey, why don't you register 
your car as an ambulance here?

1427
01:13:58,715 --> 01:13:59,902
Yeah, right. That's enough.

1428
01:14:02,285 --> 01:14:04,331
Kichu, I will be right back. 
You come here.

1429
01:14:05,015 --> 01:14:06,067
What is it?

1430
01:14:06,092 --> 01:14:08,622
I called you many times, 
but you didn't answer.

1431
01:14:10,074 --> 01:14:11,082
My phone is in the car.

1432
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:13,951
My friend's dad had 
seizure yesterday.

1433
01:14:14,260 --> 01:14:16,610
Almost immediately, 
we rushed him to the hospital.

1434
01:14:16,635 --> 01:14:18,940
I left my phone in the car, 
so I couldn’t attend. Sorry.

1435
01:14:19,136 --> 01:14:20,716
Why is that girl crying?

1436
01:14:20,769 --> 01:14:21,777
That girl?

1437
01:14:22,139 --> 01:14:24,427
She is crying from the joy 
of her dad having seizure.

1438
01:14:24,452 --> 01:14:26,350
We are having a party tonight. 
Ain't you coming?

1439
01:14:26,375 --> 01:14:27,922
Then, you stay with here.

1440
01:14:28,215 --> 01:14:30,071
I will get it dressed.

1441
01:14:30,409 --> 01:14:31,752
You will go alone?

1442
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:33,548
So you are capable of 
understanding things?

1443
01:14:33,738 --> 01:14:35,628
No, I will give it a try alone.

1444
01:14:35,679 --> 01:14:37,057
No worries, I will also come.

1445
01:14:37,082 --> 01:14:38,493
Well, I don't have a problem..

1446
01:14:38,518 --> 01:14:39,732
I have a problem..

1447
01:14:39,757 --> 01:14:43,257
I will also come, let's go.

1448
01:15:05,862 --> 01:15:08,463
I thought you were 
a typical jerk.

1449
01:15:10,851 --> 01:15:11,858
But you are not.

1450
01:15:14,046 --> 01:15:15,412
- Shall I go? 
- Hmm.

1451
01:15:17,913 --> 01:15:20,019
Doesn't mean that you have 
to be arrogant about it.

1452
01:15:20,233 --> 01:15:21,577
Okay.

1453
01:15:21,804 --> 01:15:25,000
Hey, I could come to 
pick you tomorrow.

1454
01:15:25,378 --> 01:15:26,386
No need for that.

1455
01:15:26,580 --> 01:15:27,588
No, it's alright.

1456
01:15:27,702 --> 01:15:28,710
- I will come. 
- No need.

1457
01:15:29,253 --> 01:15:30,503
Call me.

1458
01:15:30,530 --> 01:15:31,554

If you are free 
tomorrow morning,

1479
01:17:57,656 --> 01:18:00,133
will you come somewhere with me?

1480
01:19:57,103 --> 01:19:58,975
No one is against for 
being in a relationship.

1481
01:19:59,149 --> 01:20:01,006
But no one should even 
talk about marriage

1482
01:20:01,031 --> 01:20:03,652
till you get a job 
and get on your feet.

1483
01:20:04,343 --> 01:20:07,260
Is it because I had a job 
Sreenu, that I married you?

1484
01:20:07,594 --> 01:20:11,546
We got till here, by selling the 
fruits and nuts off our farm.

1485
01:20:11,571 --> 01:20:13,556
The God that gave us life, 
will give us the means.

1486
01:20:13,581 --> 01:20:14,589
Granny, massage my hair.

1487
01:20:15,063 --> 01:20:16,071
Your fruits and nuts!

1488
01:20:16,383 --> 01:20:19,124
These day's, to live in the 
city, you need real money.

1489
01:20:19,149 --> 01:20:21,008
Don't entertain his craziness.

1490
01:20:22,610 --> 01:20:24,337
My dear boy, 
dad isn't encouraging you.

1491
01:20:24,657 --> 01:20:26,001
You don't have anything.

1492
01:20:29,202 --> 01:20:31,985
You two needn't 
quarrel over this.

1493
01:20:32,916 --> 01:20:36,280
My boy, is old enough to 
think about his future.

1494
01:20:36,566 --> 01:20:41,715
I married my Raman's 
father, when I was sixteen.

1495
01:20:41,852 --> 01:20:43,124
Listen dear,

1496
01:20:43,197 --> 01:20:46,119
your grandfather was 
only your age then.

1497
01:20:46,144 --> 01:20:48,293
- Your grandfather was really 
- If you do that today,

1498
01:20:48,318 --> 01:20:50,933
- graceful, like Apollo. 
- you will get booked for child abuse.

1499
01:20:51,035 --> 01:20:54,945
Your grandfather used to buy me 
honey candy from then itself.

1500
01:20:55,102 --> 01:20:56,621
So, grandpa was really romantic?

1501
01:20:57,818 --> 01:20:59,115
Those used to be the days.

1502
01:20:59,851 --> 01:21:02,993
Those days, from Ceylon 
your grandfather used to..

1503
01:21:03,018 --> 01:21:05,042
No, that's enough, 
I don't want to hear this story.

1504
01:21:05,089 --> 01:21:06,753
Play with Tutu for now.

1505
01:21:06,778 --> 01:21:08,043
I will come now. Yeah Venkedi.

1506
01:21:08,348 --> 01:21:09,971
You get lost. There are

1507
01:21:09,996 --> 01:21:12,081
people, who came from Ceylon.

1508
01:21:12,442 --> 01:21:13,450
That’s enough.

1509
01:21:15,874 --> 01:21:17,987
Do you really want to 
go to the middle east?

1510
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:20,992
Didn't you attend 
the campus interview?

1511
01:21:21,065 --> 01:21:22,375
You will definitely get placed.

1512
01:21:22,435 --> 01:21:24,726
Why don't you wait till then?

1513
01:21:26,044 --> 01:21:27,849
This campus interview is a joke.

1514
01:21:27,874 --> 01:21:30,292
If I keep waiting for that, 
the bank will foreclose my home.

1515
01:21:30,317 --> 01:21:32,632
And the people we owe money, 
will start to eat our brains.

1516
01:21:32,657 --> 01:21:35,319
I decided to go there, with my 
uncle, to avoid facing this music.

1517
01:21:35,344 --> 01:21:37,123
In that case, 
I have got an awesome idea, you

1518
01:21:37,148 --> 01:21:38,665
go and cheat some 
Arab there and make

1519
01:21:38,690 --> 01:21:40,234
a lot of money and 
come, we will start

1520
01:21:40,259 --> 01:21:41,839
a big business with 
that money together.

1521
01:21:42,698 --> 01:21:44,982
Hey don't forget to get 
dates while you are there.

1522
01:21:45,007 --> 01:21:46,035
Definitely.

1523
01:21:46,060 --> 01:21:49,142
Instead of trying to stop him from 
leaving, you guys are just fooling around.

1524
01:21:49,456 --> 01:21:51,152
I don't have a choice.

1525
01:21:51,177 --> 01:21:54,214
I have a lot of pressure from 
home, and moreover there are a lot

1526
01:21:54,239 --> 01:21:57,276
of debts owed by my dad, 
when he tried to do business like Trump.

1527
01:21:58,700 --> 01:21:59,708
So, you have decided?

1528
01:22:00,052 --> 01:22:02,911
It's decided, I have to settle 
all these commitments, after

1529
01:22:02,936 --> 01:22:05,794
going abroad, and then get 
married, to make new commitments.

1530
01:22:06,146 --> 01:22:07,474
Not funny.

1531
01:22:07,820 --> 01:22:08,836
Didn't like it?

1532
01:22:09,310 --> 01:22:10,317
Get lost.

1533
01:22:12,685 --> 01:22:14,193
- Has he gone mad? 
- See you guys.

1534
01:22:14,310 --> 01:22:16,997
I am going to start the life 
of an expat in a far off land.

1535
01:22:18,161 --> 01:22:20,649
After that, I need to help you all out. 
You stop

1536
01:22:20,674 --> 01:22:23,035
fooling around and try 
to help out your family.

1537
01:22:24,161 --> 01:22:25,169
Hey Venkedi.

1538
01:22:29,247 --> 01:22:32,146
Hey, do think over about that campus 
interview, before deciding anything.

1539
01:22:34,481 --> 01:22:39,329
If one has to leave his friends and family 
behind, he should be really desperate.

1540
01:22:56,498 --> 01:22:57,506
Gautham,

1541
01:22:58,989 --> 01:23:00,473
what are you doing up here?

1542
01:23:01,959 --> 01:23:03,459
Granny is really upset.

1543
01:23:05,091 --> 01:23:06,739
You forgot that it's 
her birthday today.

1544
01:23:07,422 --> 01:23:09,414
- Damn. 
- She is really grumpy.

1545
01:23:09,503 --> 01:23:10,885
You do one thing.

1546
01:23:11,091 --> 01:23:12,099
You hold this.

1547
01:23:12,645 --> 01:23:13,810
- Here. 
- Silk?

1548
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:14,928
Give this to her.

1549
01:23:15,077 --> 01:23:16,085
And cheer her up.

1550
01:23:17,395 --> 01:23:18,522
- Gautham. 
- Hmm.

1551
01:23:18,794 --> 01:23:19,973
- Come. 
- I will.

1552
01:23:25,575 --> 01:23:26,582
Granny.

1553
01:23:28,539 --> 01:23:29,547
Granny.

1554
01:23:30,360 --> 01:23:31,538
Granny, why are you upset?

1555
01:23:31,755 --> 01:23:32,763
Please don't hurt me.

1556
01:23:33,091 --> 01:23:35,051
Look what Gautham has 
got for your birthday.

1557
01:23:35,239 --> 01:23:36,669
Look... Look..

1558
01:23:37,461 --> 01:23:40,025
Granny's favorite Silk, here.

1559
01:23:44,849 --> 01:23:46,458
Didn't like it, what happened?

1560
01:23:47,411 --> 01:23:48,579
Hey, this isn't cool.

1561
01:23:48,806 --> 01:23:50,892
To be upset on your 
birthday, you are 80 now.

1562
01:23:51,091 --> 01:23:52,840
We need to score a 100.

1563
01:23:52,966 --> 01:23:54,544
Yeah right!

1564
01:23:54,630 --> 01:23:57,658
Will anyone be happy when they grow 
old, you fool?

1565
01:23:57,930 --> 01:23:59,120
What if you have grown old?

1566
01:23:59,532 --> 01:24:01,801
You are still a dream 
girl, Mr granny.

1567
01:24:02,177 --> 01:24:04,019
That reminds of something,

1568
01:24:04,044 --> 01:24:07,460
back then your grandfather, 
my Raman's father.

1569
01:24:07,485 --> 01:24:09,930
That’s' enough, 
I don't want to hear this story.

1570
01:24:09,955 --> 01:24:13,252
It's not that, 
back then he used to say,

1571
01:24:13,277 --> 01:24:16,042
I used to look like 
Sheela in Chemmeen.

1572
01:24:16,067 --> 01:24:18,116
Yeah right! 
And then Pareekutty used to drive

1573
01:24:18,141 --> 01:24:20,164
all the way from Ceylon 
to see his Karuthamma.

1574
01:24:20,189 --> 01:24:23,226
(Song from Chemmeen.)

1575
01:24:23,251 --> 01:24:25,682
Honey, here is your honey candy. 
Isn't this that story.

1576
01:24:25,917 --> 01:24:27,882
Look at her, 
an old beauty queen.

1577
01:24:27,936 --> 01:24:28,944
You get lost.

1578
01:24:29,880 --> 01:24:30,888
What to do?

1579
01:24:31,286 --> 01:24:36,191
I had big plans for mom's 80th 
birthday, by calling friends and family.

1580
01:24:36,216 --> 01:24:37,544
Dad, you can still do that.

1581
01:24:37,685 --> 01:24:38,856
What's the use of all that?

1582
01:24:39,131 --> 01:24:42,316
All our relatives are scattered 
across Chennai and Mumbai.

1583
01:24:42,997 --> 01:24:44,560
What's the use of 
mom being upset?

1584
01:24:45,642 --> 01:24:47,095
So, that's the real reason.

1585
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:50,114
Dad, that's not an issue.

1586
01:24:50,851 --> 01:24:51,859
I will fix it now.

1587
01:24:52,872 --> 01:24:53,880
Mr Karuthamma,

1588
01:24:55,161 --> 01:24:56,169
today is your big day.

1589
01:24:56,526 --> 01:24:58,066
What more do you 
need to be happy?

1590
01:24:58,626 --> 01:24:59,634
Evening at temple,

1591
01:25:00,114 --> 01:25:01,122
more of Silk.

1592
01:25:01,356 --> 01:25:02,599
What do you want, tell me?

1593
01:25:03,075 --> 01:25:06,438
Mom, don't have it all, 
you are getting older.

1594
01:25:06,474 --> 01:25:07,481
Tell me Karuthamma.

1595
01:25:07,601 --> 01:25:08,695
I don't want anything.

1596
01:25:10,950 --> 01:25:11,958
Look here.

1597
01:25:12,349 --> 01:25:14,313
Your grandchild is 
worth 300 rupees.

1598
01:25:14,981 --> 01:25:15,989
Tell me, granny.

1599
01:25:16,257 --> 01:25:19,397
I will get you anything under the 
sky, that can be bought for money.

1600
01:25:19,531 --> 01:25:20,926
This Gautham will fulfill it.

1601
01:25:21,784 --> 01:25:23,147
Will you fulfill my wish?

1602
01:25:23,209 --> 01:25:24,418
For sure, I will arrange it.

1603
01:25:24,747 --> 01:25:27,229
Then I need to see Rama Sethu.

1604
01:25:28,153 --> 01:25:29,403
Will you arrange that for me?

1605
01:25:30,481 --> 01:25:31,489
Rama Sethu!

1606
01:25:33,310 --> 01:25:34,765
- Dad? 
- I heard.

1607
01:25:34,873 --> 01:25:36,185
Here's my share of 300.

1608
01:25:36,317 --> 01:25:38,509
A pilgrimage to Rameshwaram, 
through Dhanushkodi.

1609
01:25:38,677 --> 01:25:41,616
Dad arrange it, 
let's go and wash off your sins.

let's have breakfast from here.

01:27:46,680 --> 01:27:48,375
We will go to the place 
we went yesterday.

1625
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:50,743
- Granny, aren't you hungry? 
- Isn't it around the corner?

1626
01:27:50,978 --> 01:27:52,767
- Dad, what' this? 
- This is a rundown shop.

1627

Mom, hold her please. 
I am really hungry,

1628
01:27:54,598 --> 01:27:55,744
- I am leaving. 
- Please do.

1629
01:27:56,087 --> 01:27:59,119
What else? 
Let him go on his own.

1630
01:27:59,415 --> 01:28:01,047
You know what, 
will you buy me a tea?

1631
01:28:01,117 --> 01:28:03,891
No, can't buy you tea, but can buy 
you coffee instead. Filter coffee.

1632
01:28:03,916 --> 01:28:05,791
That's what I am talking about. 
Come, let's go.

1633

1649
01:30:36,445 --> 01:30:41,531
But, granny never believed in it, 
and left this world to join grandpa.

1650
01:30:42,974 --> 01:30:48,544
Even then, her last breath 
was filled inside Nanappan.

1651
01:32:04,226 --> 01:32:05,793
Don't you have just one luggage?

1652
01:32:09,661 --> 01:32:10,669
So Gautham,

1653
01:32:11,539 --> 01:32:13,398
I don't have much 
of advice for you.

1654
01:32:13,544 --> 01:32:16,249
Don't get yourself into 
trouble, I can't be there with

1655
01:32:16,287 --> 01:32:18,515
you like before to get 
beaten up and hatch schemes.

1656
01:32:18,583 --> 01:32:21,701
I will be an expat as soon 
as I cross those gates.

1657
01:32:22,591 --> 01:32:23,599
So anyways,

1658
01:32:25,575 --> 01:32:26,930
I am only leaving physically.

1659
01:32:27,808 --> 01:32:31,274
I have left my soul in the 
front seat of your Nanappan,

1660
01:32:31,299 --> 01:32:34,331
go and keep it safely in 
our neighborhood’s fence wall.

1661
01:32:36,343 --> 01:32:38,791
All right then I am leaving, 
I might cry if I stay.

1662
01:33:04,217 --> 01:33:05,537
I am totally feeling low.

1663
01:33:10,607 --> 01:33:11,615
Granny is no more.

1664
01:33:14,123 --> 01:33:15,131
Venkedi too has left.

1665
01:33:17,654 --> 01:33:20,021
I feel like I am 
loosing everyone I love.

1666
01:33:20,857 --> 01:33:21,865
I get it.

1667
01:33:23,646 --> 01:33:25,419
How attached you were 
with your granny,

1668
01:33:26,631 --> 01:33:28,237
and what Venkedi meant to you?

1669
01:33:28,912 --> 01:33:31,302
- But, if you are 
going to be like this,

1670
01:33:31,327 --> 01:33:32,740
They were a part of my life.

1671
01:33:33,506 --> 01:33:34,514
I know that.

1672
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:37,865
I am like half dead now.

1673
01:33:40,115 --> 01:33:41,536
I feel empty inside.

1674
01:33:42,326 --> 01:33:43,959
But, there's something 
you need to know.

1675
01:33:44,943 --> 01:33:47,529
Nothing or nobody 
is constant in life.

1676
01:33:48,427 --> 01:33:50,325
Everyone will get busy 
with their own stuff.

1677
01:33:51,537 --> 01:33:52,545
But if you keep looking,

1678
01:33:52,849 --> 01:33:54,083
there will always be someone.

1679
01:33:55,106 --> 01:33:56,114
And maybe,

1680
01:33:56,982 --> 01:33:59,044
that person can bring 
light into your life.

1681
01:34:00,771 --> 01:34:02,255
But, 
I am surrounded by darkness.

1682
01:34:04,584 --> 01:34:06,027
I feel all alone.

1683
01:34:07,388 --> 01:34:08,396
What about me?

1684
01:34:10,568 --> 01:34:11,576
It's not that.

1685
01:34:13,357 --> 01:34:15,377
I smell a break-up.

1686
01:34:17,904 --> 01:34:19,216
So, that's what it is all about?

1687
01:34:20,646 --> 01:34:25,083
Usually, it's in such 
scenarios that it takes place.

1688
01:34:25,239 --> 01:34:26,896
We will make a call 
on this, today itself.

1689
01:34:26,921 --> 01:34:28,765
Are you going to break-up with 
me, now itself?

1690
01:34:29,802 --> 01:34:31,903
Aren't your parent's fine 
with our relationship?

1691
01:34:32,591 --> 01:34:34,372
So you need to know 
what's my parent's feel?

1692
01:34:34,482 --> 01:34:35,490
Hmm.

1693
01:34:36,178 --> 01:34:38,763
I will talk to my dad, 
and get you an appointment.

1694
01:34:40,841 --> 01:34:43,154
Who is your dad, 
to be met only by appointment?

1695
01:35:21,114 --> 01:35:22,380
Aren't you Gautham?

1696
01:35:22,895 --> 01:35:24,848
You should have got my photo?

1697
01:35:25,545 --> 01:35:27,558
- I too got one. 
- I don't need a photo for this.

1698
01:35:28,488 --> 01:35:31,576
I figured out it was you, 
from your excitement.

1699
01:35:32,869 --> 01:35:34,169
Kalayani has told me everything.

1700
01:35:34,848 --> 01:35:37,497
I can make a decision, 
if I get to hear what Gautham has to say.

1701
01:35:39,505 --> 01:35:40,513
Uncle,

1702
01:35:43,278 --> 01:35:44,286
Sir, order please.

1703
01:35:44,311 --> 01:35:45,951
Fresh lime.

1704
01:35:46,162 --> 01:35:47,170
Give us something chill.

1705
01:35:47,568 --> 01:35:48,576
The best in the menu.

1706
01:35:48,708 --> 01:35:49,716
What about Mojito?

1707
01:35:50,895 --> 01:35:52,290
- Good choice. 
- Isn't that Mogito?

1708
01:35:52,444 --> 01:35:54,116
- Mogito? 
- No Mojito.

1709
01:35:54,443 --> 01:35:55,451
Mojito.

1710
01:35:55,476 --> 01:35:56,484
Now tell me.

1711
01:35:56,748 --> 01:35:57,756
What's you position?

1712
01:36:01,990 --> 01:36:03,232
Uncle, I love Kalyani.

1713
01:36:04,263 --> 01:36:05,987
Will you let me marry Kalyani?

1714
01:36:08,465 --> 01:36:12,711
Usually, at this point the girl's 
father turn's out to be the villain.

1715
01:36:13,298 --> 01:36:18,251
But the smartness you showed in 
presenting things with a cool mind.

1716
01:36:19,629 --> 01:36:20,637
I liked that.

1717
01:36:20,965 --> 01:36:22,598
I am impressed.

1718
01:36:22,623 --> 01:36:23,817
Thank you.

1719
01:36:23,849 --> 01:36:26,076
Gautham, 
who all do you have at home?

1720
01:36:26,506 --> 01:36:28,052
Mom, Dad and Granny.

1721
01:36:32,040 --> 01:36:34,629
Only Dad, Mom and me at my home.

1722
01:36:34,654 --> 01:36:35,771
Are they working?

1723
01:36:37,129 --> 01:36:38,993
My dad's a retired Postmaster.

1724
01:36:39,224 --> 01:36:40,232
My mom's a homemaker.

1725
01:36:40,458 --> 01:36:41,466
You are the only son?

1726
01:36:41,693 --> 01:36:42,701
Yes.

1727
01:36:42,896 --> 01:36:44,083
Pampered?

1728
01:36:44,529 --> 01:36:46,138
Nothing like that.

1729
01:36:47,052 --> 01:36:48,528
What do you do now, Gautham?

1730
01:36:49,262 --> 01:36:51,731
Now, I have got through 
my campus selection.

1731
01:36:52,802 --> 01:36:53,833
Just waiting for now.

1732
01:36:54,685 --> 01:36:55,843
They will call soon.

1733
01:36:55,897 --> 01:36:58,070
Move that car, 
they need to put lights.

1734
01:36:58,095 --> 01:36:59,894
So, you and Kalayani are 
the same age?

1735
01:36:59,919 --> 01:37:01,646
Almost the same age.

1736
01:37:01,671 --> 01:37:03,605
Excuse me sir, 
could you please move your car.

1737
01:37:03,630 --> 01:37:04,872
Fine, I will do it in 10 min's.

1738
01:37:04,897 --> 01:37:05,905
Okay sir, that's alright.

1739
01:37:07,318 --> 01:37:08,496
Gautham, is that your car?

1740
01:37:08,881 --> 01:37:10,748
This is my dad's car, 
that we use at home.

1741
01:37:11,583 --> 01:37:13,160
So Gautham do you 
have a different car?

1742
01:37:13,747 --> 01:37:15,450
I too drive this.

1743
01:37:16,162 --> 01:37:17,389
- It's a nice car. 
- Yes.Yes.

1744
01:37:17,414 --> 01:37:18,461
How much did it cost?

1745
01:37:18,486 --> 01:37:21,243
- 125,000. 
- Hmm?

1746
01:37:21,912 --> 01:37:23,489
One hundred and 
twenty five thousand.

1747
01:37:24,114 --> 01:37:25,121
That's it.

1748
01:37:25,264 --> 01:37:26,717
We bought it used.

1749
01:37:26,858 --> 01:37:27,866
Did you buy it, Gautham?

1750
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:30,361
- My dad. 
- Nice car.

1751
01:37:30,739 --> 01:37:33,591
There was an incident behind 
which the company chairman

1752
01:37:33,616 --> 01:37:36,060
decided to launch such a 
car, in the car market.

1753
01:37:37,544 --> 01:37:39,033
Do you know that story Gautham?

1754
01:37:40,544 --> 01:37:44,320
One day this company's chairman, 
while traveling through the streets

1755
01:37:44,345 --> 01:37:47,904
of Mumbai, in his luxury car, 
gets to a sight at the traffic stop.

1756
01:37:48,355 --> 01:37:50,612
A person going for 
work in his bike,

1757
01:37:50,684 --> 01:37:55,502
along with his wife and 3 
kids, and all of their stuff.

1758
01:37:56,536 --> 01:37:59,223
An entire life traveling 
on a bike cramped,

1759
01:37:59,248 --> 01:38:02,114
with all their live's 
hanging by a thin thread.

1760
01:38:02,302 --> 01:38:03,786
That's what he got to saw?

1761
01:38:04,106 --> 01:38:05,114
Oh!

1762
01:38:05,373 --> 01:38:08,396
Had it been Gautham or me in his 
position, we would have made cliche

1763
01:38:08,421 --> 01:38:12,224
comment of, couldn't you have squeezed 
one more in, and would have left.

1764
01:38:12,654 --> 01:38:15,794
But what he thought and 
did, became history.

1765
01:38:17,222 --> 01:38:20,789
What kind of an industrialist are 
you, if you can't do

1766
01:38:20,830 --> 01:38:24,637
anything to ensure the safe 
travel of a normal family, in

1767
01:38:24,725 --> 01:38:28,455
one's own country, 
was the question he asked to himself,

1768
01:38:28,487 --> 01:38:31,955
and the answer is the car 
that Gautham's dad bought.

1769
01:38:33,552 --> 01:38:34,599
India's cheapest car.

1770
01:38:36,701 --> 01:38:39,924
How will I get my daughter 
married to you Gautham, to someone

1771
01:38:39,949 --> 01:38:42,912
who can't even afford to buy 
such a used car on his own?

1772
01:38:44,607 --> 01:38:47,207
Uncle, 
I am not asking you to rush.

1773
01:38:47,337 --> 01:38:48,384
Then?

1774
01:38:48,786 --> 01:38:52,041
- After I get a good job. 
- That's the kind of life she is used to.

1775
01:38:54,319 --> 01:38:57,091
I would like to marry her off 
to somewhere better than that.

1776
01:38:57,717 --> 01:38:58,724
So Gautham,

1777
01:38:58,749 --> 01:39:01,553
just see it as an 
immature decision.

1778
01:39:02,982 --> 01:39:05,409
You two talk it 
out among yourself.

1779
01:39:08,841 --> 01:39:09,849
Nice meeting you.

1780
01:39:11,513 --> 01:39:12,521
Here is my card.

1781
01:39:12,634 --> 01:39:14,642
Maybe I can help you 
in some other way.

1782
01:39:14,755 --> 01:39:15,763
Check please.

1783
01:40:28,848 --> 01:40:31,609
We took many decisions, 
without thinking it over.

1784
01:40:32,791 --> 01:40:34,857
We should have taken life 
a little more seriously.

1785
01:40:35,537 --> 01:40:36,545
Otherwise, it will..

1786
01:40:36,570 --> 01:40:38,518
- I know of all this Kalyani. 
- What do you know?

1787
01:40:38,543 --> 01:40:40,329
You father told me 
all of this yesterday.

1788
01:40:40,354 --> 01:40:41,627
Why aren't you understanding?

1789
01:40:41,868 --> 01:40:42,962
I understood, Kalyani.

1790
01:40:43,334 --> 01:40:44,808
And what did you understand?

1791
01:40:44,936 --> 01:40:47,093
We fell in love, 
without thinking about the future.

1792
01:40:47,490 --> 01:40:48,498
I get it now.

1793
01:40:49,710 --> 01:40:52,219
That's not it, why aren't you 
thinking about our parents.

1794
01:40:53,204 --> 01:40:55,161
Damn cliche.

1795
01:40:55,380 --> 01:40:56,388
Uptown Girl.

1796
01:40:56,552 --> 01:40:57,560
Downtown boy.

1797
01:40:58,435 --> 01:40:59,443
Our families don't match.

1798
01:40:59,873 --> 01:41:00,880
But it's true.

1799
01:41:01,504 --> 01:41:04,372
I won't be able to provide an 
environment like the one you grew up.

1800
01:41:04,568 --> 01:41:06,928
See, this is not the 
way to handle it.

1801
01:41:06,973 --> 01:41:08,928
Yeah. 
This isn't how you handle it.

1802
01:41:09,349 --> 01:41:10,654
That's what your dad told too.

1803
01:41:11,221 --> 01:41:12,898
There's no need 
to keep it going.

1804
01:41:13,373 --> 01:41:14,841
Let me just speak, Gautham.

1805
01:41:15,091 --> 01:41:16,546
I know what you 
are about to say.

1806
01:41:17,295 --> 01:41:19,002
And I have come 
prepared for that.

1807
01:41:19,543 --> 01:41:20,551
Say it.

1808
01:41:21,480 --> 01:41:26,704
In my present state, there are a 
lot of limits, to what I could do.

1809
01:41:26,811 --> 01:41:28,678
I am trying my best..

1810
01:41:28,835 --> 01:41:30,379
Why are you stretching it?

1811
01:41:31,948 --> 01:41:33,308
Aren't you a practical person?

1812
01:41:33,826 --> 01:41:34,834
This won't work out.

1813
01:41:35,552 --> 01:41:36,560

Dad, I got a job.

Is this how you say it?

1854
01:44:49,463 --> 01:44:50,612
Sreenu.

1855
01:44:50,671 --> 01:44:51,796
- Yeah. 
- Come here.

1856
01:44:52,374 --> 01:44:53,874
Our son, got a job.

1857
01:44:54,179 --> 01:44:55,249
Oh my God!

1858
01:44:55,913 --> 01:44:57,617
My prayer's got answered.

1859
01:44:58,921 --> 01:45:01,157
Let me just call Shibu.

1860
01:45:01,182 --> 01:45:03,652
No dad, 
I need to join next week.

1861
01:45:04,565 --> 01:45:07,770
Before that, 
we need to decide a few things.

1862
01:45:08,460 --> 01:45:11,310
Listen, 
it's written Mumbai in this.

1863
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:15,763
After training, 
first posting will be in Mumbai.

1864
01:45:17,210 --> 01:45:20,931
So it's just Dad, Mom and 
Nanappan, all alone here?

1865
01:45:23,374 --> 01:45:25,236
You try for a transfer slowly..

1866
01:45:25,261 --> 01:45:26,308
I was coming to that.

1867
01:45:27,648 --> 01:45:30,007
Before I leave, 
we need to sell the car.

1868
01:45:32,663 --> 01:45:35,663
Is that needed? Let it be here.

1869
01:45:35,776 --> 01:45:37,972
If I am not here, 
there's no need for that too here.

1870
01:45:38,130 --> 01:45:39,413
Who is going to drive it here?

1871
01:45:39,577 --> 01:45:41,640
It's not like you 
are gone forever.

1872
01:45:41,665 --> 01:45:42,985
Won't you come for the holidays?

1873
01:45:43,021 --> 01:45:44,106
You can drive it then.

1874
01:45:44,398 --> 01:45:45,406
- Yeah. 
- No Mom.

1875
01:45:45,671 --> 01:45:47,427
With such a good job,

1876
01:45:47,751 --> 01:45:48,781
that car won't look nice.

1877
01:45:49,531 --> 01:45:51,222
We will buy a new one.

1878
01:45:52,843 --> 01:45:53,851
We can buy a new one,

1879
01:45:54,015 --> 01:45:55,771
but there is no need 
to sell Nanappan.

1880
01:45:56,125 --> 01:45:59,321
Dad, can we afford to maintain 
2 car's at the same time.

1881
01:46:00,531 --> 01:46:03,559
My dear, even after you have 
left, when the car is still

1882
01:46:03,584 --> 01:46:06,239
there, we get the feeling 
that you are still here.

1883
01:46:06,505 --> 01:46:08,585
Dad, could you please stop 
your cheap sentiment's?

1884
01:46:10,781 --> 01:46:11,788
That vehicle is worn out.

1885
01:46:13,288 --> 01:46:14,296
It's time is over.

1886
01:46:31,159 --> 01:46:32,175
Gauthametta,

1887
01:46:32,632 --> 01:46:33,840
Shall we buy Nanappan?

1888
01:46:33,865 --> 01:46:34,933
For what?

1889
01:46:34,958 --> 01:46:37,224
I will pay the money that you 
have agreed to sell it for.

1890
01:46:37,249 --> 01:46:38,257
Are you mad, Kichu?

1891
01:46:38,429 --> 01:46:40,761
Why do you need this completely 
worn out heap of trash?

1892
01:46:40,852 --> 01:46:42,126
Other than wasting your money.

1893
01:46:42,386 --> 01:46:45,839
Its not that bro, 
its the car that saved my dad's life.

1894
01:46:46,452 --> 01:46:48,350
- Kichu. 
- I feel bad to see it go.

1895
01:46:49,749 --> 01:46:50,757
This is just a machine.

1896
01:46:51,468 --> 01:46:52,476
It doesn't have a soul.

1897
01:46:53,515 --> 01:46:55,472
You needn't get 
emotional with it.

1898
01:46:56,164 --> 01:46:57,172
Got it.

1899
01:47:01,296 --> 01:47:02,304
I will open it.

1900
01:47:02,939 --> 01:47:05,439
There's a small issue with the 
lock, we can change that.

1901
01:47:06,507 --> 01:47:07,656
Even the clutch has issues.

1902
01:47:07,726 --> 01:47:08,734
Oh, is the clutch loose?

1903
01:47:08,795 --> 01:47:09,982
And the wiring is loose too.

1904
01:47:10,067 --> 01:47:11,623
You may deduct the 
price for those.

1905
01:47:11,648 --> 01:47:12,712
Please sign this paper.

1906
01:47:12,737 --> 01:47:14,874
I will get it signed 
and bring it over.

1907
01:47:17,132 --> 01:47:18,734
Dad, please sign these.

1908
01:47:21,951 --> 01:47:23,312
Can't you just think it over?

1909
01:47:24,599 --> 01:47:27,434
Dad, it's going to get rusted without 
being used, please listen to me.

1910
01:47:27,804 --> 01:47:28,812
Please sign it.

1911
01:47:45,655 --> 01:47:46,834
- Alright then. 
- Take it.

1912
01:47:56,466 --> 01:47:58,111
One minute, let me try.

1913
01:48:01,987 --> 01:48:02,995
Just stamp your feet.

1914
01:48:05,920 --> 01:48:07,670
- That's it, not a big issue. 
- Okay.

1915
01:48:07,741 --> 01:48:08,749
Alright then.

1916
01:49:09,371 --> 01:49:10,714
Has it been long, 
since you came.

1917
01:49:10,879 --> 01:49:11,887
No, I just came.

1918
01:49:12,106 --> 01:49:13,543
All the papers are in this.

1919
01:49:13,731 --> 01:49:16,059
We had transferred 
the first installment.

1920
01:49:16,200 --> 01:49:17,680
- Didn't you get it? 
- Yeah, I got it.

1921
01:49:18,457 --> 01:49:19,496
So, shall I leave?

1922
01:49:19,521 --> 01:49:21,544
- Alright then. 
- Call me, if there is anything.

1923
01:49:21,568 --> 01:49:22,576
Sure.

1924
01:49:23,129 --> 01:49:24,137
Sir, just a minute.

1925
01:49:24,270 --> 01:49:25,762
There's a few of 
your stuff inside

1926
01:49:25,793 --> 01:49:27,153
the car, 
please take those as well.

1927
01:50:04,993 --> 01:50:07,344
Shibu asked to bath 
Nanappan with shampoo.

1928
01:50:18,395 --> 01:50:20,402
Buy me a silk.

1929
01:50:31,098 --> 01:50:32,137
Sir, what happened?

1930
01:50:32,270 --> 01:50:33,278
Is anything missing?

1931
01:50:34,911 --> 01:50:35,918
No, I found it.

1932
01:50:35,957 --> 01:50:36,965
Okay.

1933
01:50:42,035 --> 01:50:44,660
Give him, 
to someone who is good.

1934
01:50:44,762 --> 01:50:45,770
Sure sir.

1935
01:51:09,864 --> 01:51:11,854
There's no point in being 
sentimental with me,

1936
01:51:11,879 --> 01:51:13,614
I won't fall for your 
sentiments as well.

1937
01:51:13,887 --> 01:51:15,481
If it meant that much, why

1938
01:51:15,506 --> 01:51:16,535
did you sell the car.

1939
01:51:19,218 --> 01:51:21,480
Basheerikka, 
that was a blunder I made 3 years ago.

1940
01:51:22,151 --> 01:51:24,190
I have come to correct it.

1941
01:51:25,832 --> 01:51:27,512
Haven't you heard that 
we only realise the

1942
01:51:27,537 --> 01:51:29,762
true value of something 
after we loose it.

1943
01:51:30,183 --> 01:51:31,855
That's absolutely true.

1944
01:51:33,192 --> 01:51:34,746
I was persistent after that bro.

1945
01:51:35,668 --> 01:51:38,410
Persistent to prove myself in 
front of Kalayani and her dad.

1946
01:51:38,778 --> 01:51:40,918
You do things according 
to your whims and fancies,

1947
01:51:40,943 --> 01:51:42,784
and then there's no point 
in crying out to me.

1948
01:51:42,809 --> 01:51:44,020
I won't give you the car!

1949
01:51:49,191 --> 01:51:50,199
Bro,

1950
01:51:50,747 --> 01:51:51,754
my life's,

1951
01:51:52,340 --> 01:51:54,692
memorable moment's 
took place in that car.

1952
01:51:55,768 --> 01:51:57,509
My memories of my dad and 
mom, and my late

1953
01:51:57,534 --> 01:51:59,416
granny is there in the 
car that is with you.

1954
01:52:00,324 --> 01:52:03,870
From here on, 
I wish that car to be in my driveway.

1955
01:52:04,911 --> 01:52:07,567
That's why I came all 
this way to see you.

1956
01:52:08,536 --> 01:52:10,934
Have you seen the movie 
" In Harihar Nagar"?

1957
01:52:11,121 --> 01:52:13,239
In that, 
the baddie John Honai says the

1958
01:52:13,264 --> 01:52:14,636
dialogue, 
"Give me that briefcase."

1959
01:52:14,661 --> 01:52:18,082
There's no use saying, 
"Give me that car", like that.

1960
01:52:18,176 --> 01:52:19,184
I don't wish to sell it.

1961
01:52:25,043 --> 01:52:26,051
Basheerikka,

1962
01:52:26,753 --> 01:52:28,268
for how much did 
you buy that car?

1963
01:52:28,801 --> 01:52:31,512
I paid 100,000+tax for that car.

1964
01:52:32,301 --> 01:52:33,575
My dear bro, they tricked you.

1965
01:52:34,504 --> 01:52:36,512
I sold them this car for 40,000. 
Do you know that?

1966
01:52:36,942 --> 01:52:37,950
For 40,000?

1967
01:52:38,285 --> 01:52:39,293
Yeah.

1968
01:52:39,382 --> 01:52:41,882
Oh my God, 
so that's a loss of 60,000+tax.

1969
01:52:42,129 --> 01:52:43,247
Let me make you an offer.

1970
01:52:43,272 --> 01:52:44,573
You also go ahead and trick me.

1971
01:52:44,598 --> 01:52:46,551
I will give you 125,000.

1972
01:52:46,738 --> 01:52:48,012
Will you sell me the car then?

1973
01:52:49,090 --> 01:52:52,028
My dear boy, 
my Biryani business runs out of it.

1974
01:52:52,411 --> 01:52:53,676
- Biryani? 
- Yeah.

1975
01:52:53,701 --> 01:52:55,456
Haven't you seen it by 
the side of the road?

1976
01:52:55,481 --> 01:52:56,948
Ummukulsu Biryani for 50 rupees.

1977
01:52:56,973 --> 01:52:57,981
It's a big business.

1978
01:52:58,012 --> 01:52:59,200
That's mine.

1979
01:53:04,215 --> 01:53:05,223
Alright,

1980
01:53:05,332 --> 01:53:07,316
Then I will give you 135,000. 
Is it a deal then?

1981
01:53:07,582 --> 01:53:08,589
Do we have a deal?

1982
01:53:09,918 --> 01:53:11,840
I could change my business 
to an auto rickshaw.

1983
01:53:11,865 --> 01:53:13,949
- Of course. 
- But that won't work out.

1984
01:53:14,106 --> 01:53:16,910
My wife and kid haven't 
got enough of that car.

1985
01:53:21,497 --> 01:53:22,543
Bro,

1986
01:53:23,117 --> 01:53:26,469
165,000. Don't ask for more, 
it's my 2 month's salary.

1987
01:53:30,015 --> 01:53:32,459
Well, we can somehow 
convince the wife and kid.

1988
01:54:11,376 --> 01:54:13,353
That's my daughter, Ummukulsu.

1989
01:54:14,295 --> 01:54:15,756
Go ahead, and check out the car.

1990
01:54:27,104 --> 01:54:28,112
Hi.

1991
01:54:36,144 --> 01:54:37,519
- Haven't you found it? 
- Yeah.

1992
01:54:38,043 --> 01:54:40,152
- Who is that? 
- That's Honai from Bombay.

1993
01:54:40,177 --> 01:54:41,591
This car used to be 
his, before we

1994
01:54:41,616 --> 01:54:43,332
bought it. 
Now, he want's it back.

1995
01:54:46,645 --> 01:54:49,339
You are selling the car? 
What are you saying? No, you can't.

1996
01:54:49,442 --> 01:54:52,870
He is ready to pay a premium for it. 
We will buy a new car.

1997
01:54:52,919 --> 01:54:54,630
But still, 
this is our first car.

1998
01:54:54,756 --> 01:54:56,848
That won't be a problem, 
it will be alright.

1999
01:54:56,873 --> 01:55:00,075
Hello. Come, 
don't we have to close the deal?

2000
01:55:18,283 --> 01:55:19,291
Your daughter.

2001
01:55:21,889 --> 01:55:25,404
Come here my dear. 
Aren't you a good girl.

2002
01:55:25,699 --> 01:55:28,096
This uncle will be 
taking this car.

2003
01:55:28,121 --> 01:55:30,771
He has paid dad a lot of 
money, to buy

2004
01:55:30,796 --> 01:55:33,431
car, toys and chocolates. 
Shall we buy it?

2005
01:55:33,456 --> 01:55:35,621
Come, aren't you a good girl?

2006
01:55:36,731 --> 01:55:40,062
Ain't you a good girl?

2007
01:55:40,720 --> 01:55:43,653
Don't you worry about this. 
Here, take it.

2008
01:55:49,510 --> 01:55:52,229
What's bothering you? 
You have nothing to worry.

2009
01:56:07,080 --> 01:56:08,088
I am not taking him bro.

2010
01:56:12,815 --> 01:56:16,424
From your wife's and 
daughter's face I

2011
01:56:16,449 --> 01:56:19,716
can make out his 
place in your home.

2012
01:56:21,331 --> 01:56:25,460
I have gone through the 
same, I can understand that.

2013
01:56:26,907 --> 01:56:28,546
He belong's here now.

2014
01:56:30,286 --> 01:56:31,294
Alright then.

2015
01:56:41,028 --> 01:56:42,955
- Yeah dad. 
- My dear.

2016
01:56:44,987 --> 01:56:46,577
Isn't he there itself?

2017
01:56:47,174 --> 01:56:48,181
No dad.

2018
01:56:48,948 --> 01:56:50,502
Someone else bought it from him.

2019
01:56:52,775 --> 01:56:54,179
Can we get that 
person's address.

2020
01:56:54,292 --> 01:56:55,575
He doesn't have the address.

2021
01:56:55,829 --> 01:56:57,321
There's no use searching for it.

2022
01:56:57,346 --> 01:57:00,127
- But still, if we try..? 
- I will call you back.

2023
01:57:06,210 --> 01:57:07,218
Hello.

2024
01:57:08,080 --> 01:57:09,088
Stop.

2025
01:57:10,561 --> 01:57:12,762
My wife will surely understand.

2026
01:57:12,977 --> 01:57:17,606
And she is only 5, if you buy her a 
few candy, she will forget all of this.

2027
01:57:18,181 --> 01:57:20,499
But that's not how 
it is for old people.

2028
01:57:21,823 --> 01:57:25,159
The joy on your father's 
and mother's face, when

2029
01:57:25,184 --> 01:57:28,633
you take home Nanappan, 
that's worth a lot more.

2030
01:57:29,870 --> 01:57:32,984
I will only be relieved, 
if you leave with that car, come on.

2031
01:57:37,768 --> 01:57:38,776
Go on.

2032
01:57:56,956 --> 01:57:59,909
What's in that car to 
pay such a premium?

2033
01:58:00,159 --> 01:58:04,367
In that, 
it has a lot of his precious gems.

2034
01:58:09,748 --> 01:58:12,263
A few of you might be 
wondering, why am I so

2035
01:58:12,288 --> 01:58:15,430
possessive for this 
heap of nuts and bolts?

2036
01:58:16,087 --> 01:58:19,368
But first car, 
that's an emotion.

2037
01:58:20,015 --> 01:58:22,850
Every family must 
have had a first car.

2038
01:58:23,880 --> 01:58:28,502
I now understand, 
what my grandmother meant when she

2039
01:58:28,527 --> 01:58:31,771
said that a new car is 
like a new family member.

2040
01:58:32,441 --> 01:58:37,195
As a family, we might spend 
the most time together at home.

2041
01:58:37,708 --> 01:58:44,364
But everyone in a family sits 
closest to each other in a car.

2042
02:00:38,162 --> 02:00:41,235
You might be thinking 
that the movie is over.

2043
02:00:41,392 --> 02:00:43,010
But it isn't over.

2044
02:00:43,769 --> 02:00:47,999
There's something that I did 
not mention to Basheerikka.

2045
02:01:32,375 --> 02:01:34,682
Sir, I am slowly regaining 
all that I have lost.

2046
02:02:22,200 --> 02:02:23,208
I am going to..

2047
02:02:23,387 --> 02:02:24,395
Hey, stop there.

2048
02:02:24,763 --> 02:02:26,317
Leave, 
after you have heard me out.

2049
02:02:28,004 --> 02:02:31,177
Listen, in my present state 
I can't convince my dad.

2050
02:02:31,415 --> 02:02:32,937
But there is something 
else I can do.

2051
02:02:33,087 --> 02:02:34,094
I can wait.

2052
02:02:34,344 --> 02:02:36,381
Then, if you get a 
good job and come for

2053
02:02:36,465 --> 02:02:38,149
me, I will come with 
you in your Nanappan.

2054
02:02:40,252 --> 02:02:41,336
Really?

2055
02:02:41,903 --> 02:02:44,535
And, don't interrupt other's 
while they are talking.

2056
02:02:46,242 --> 02:02:49,123
Now, do you realise that girls can 
also makeup and not just breakup?

2057
02:02:50,327 --> 02:02:51,948
Awesome. Awesome.

2058
02:02:52,495 --> 02:02:53,502
Simply awesome.

2059
02:02:59,089 --> 02:03:04,595
Putting an end to the tradition of 
breakup's, Biker Vampire waited for

2060
02:03:04,631 --> 02:03:09,671
me in her dad's fort with a bag, 
not so heavy with social status.

2061
02:03:10,672 --> 02:03:13,863
As I held Kalayani's hand and walked 
out of there, in front of her dad,

2062
02:03:14,165 --> 02:03:18,149
it reminded me of Ramayana's 
climax that my granny used to say.

2063
02:03:19,031 --> 02:03:22,725
If she was there today, 
she would have said something like this.

2064
02:03:23,927 --> 02:03:29,842
And like Sree Raman who 
after reaching Lanka and

2065
02:03:29,867 --> 02:03:35,637
killing Ravana, 
goes back to Ayodhya along with

2066
02:03:35,662 --> 02:03:41,698
Seetha to a new life, 
my Gautham too along with

2067
02:03:41,723 --> 02:03:47,637
Kalayani in Gautham's 
Chariot are on their way.
