1
00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:28,502
This road you're seeing... do
you know which city it is in?

2
00:03:29,669 --> 00:03:34,544
This road, enveloped by water on both
sides, is actually in Chennai City.

3
00:03:36,002 --> 00:03:38,168
This road, that originates
from the Bay of Bengal...

4
00:03:39,043 --> 00:03:42,043
This road, which is sweltering
under the 3 PM sun...

5
00:03:42,964 --> 00:03:44,632
"Please let it rain here!"...

6
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:49,252
some people from the village
of Rameswaram are now praying.

7
00:03:49,711 --> 00:03:53,168
Our Father, Who art in heaven.

8
00:03:53,377 --> 00:03:57,669
We pray that India must lose in today's
cricket match played in Chennai.

9
00:03:57,996 --> 00:03:59,960
Or the match must be
cancelled due to rains.

10
00:04:00,011 --> 00:04:02,284
In these times, even
wishing for India to

11
00:04:02,341 --> 00:04:04,776
lose in cricket considered
anti-nationalism.

12
00:04:04,918 --> 00:04:09,793
Then why have these simple fisherwoman
turned into anti-nationals?

13
00:04:11,043 --> 00:04:13,918
Their men have gone
fishing into this sea.

14
00:04:15,377 --> 00:04:19,711
And India is playing against the neighbours
from the other side of this sea.

15
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:22,918
If India were to
win this match...

16
00:04:23,642 --> 00:04:27,168
the neighbour's military
may confiscate the boats.

17
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,294
They may confiscate the catch.
Or else...

18
00:04:29,793 --> 00:04:32,585
A father and his son, a man and his
brother, an uncle and his nephew...

19
00:04:32,786 --> 00:04:34,752
may be forced to perfrom
homosexual intercourse.

20
00:04:34,835 --> 00:04:36,585
Or, they might just
shoot them dead.

21
00:04:36,711 --> 00:04:41,544
And that's why they pray for India to
lose, or a rain to cancel the match.

22
00:04:41,793 --> 00:04:43,793
'I go to Buddha for refuge.'

23
00:04:44,043 --> 00:04:47,043
The Holiness of God the
Father, the noble soul; Amen.

24
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:51,377
We don't know if their prayers made
it rain, or if it just rained.

25
00:04:51,711 --> 00:04:54,210
Nor do we know the fate
of those fishermen.

26
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,627
We don't even know if the
cricket match was halted.

27
00:04:57,419 --> 00:05:01,085
If you feel this comparison is a bit
like comparing apples and oranges...

28
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:04,669
Let me tell you, this story is all
about comparing apples and oranges.

29
00:05:05,294 --> 00:05:08,502
If you see an apple, it's an apple.
If you see an orange, it's an orange.

30
00:05:08,793 --> 00:05:10,419
And now, it's the
story of oranges.

31
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:15,294
This girl ceaselessly riding her
scooter in the ceaseless rain...

32
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:16,822
goes by Althea Johnson.

33
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,085
An Anglo-Indian.

34
00:05:19,544 --> 00:05:21,835
She's got a corporate job,
makes 80 thousand a month.

35
00:05:23,419 --> 00:05:27,043
Her 80 thousand salary doesn't
keep Activa tyres from going flat.

36
00:05:27,793 --> 00:05:30,586
If it's meant to go
flat, it will go glat.

37
00:06:07,085 --> 00:06:12,085
The 65 year old man accused of
raping the minor school-girl...

38
00:06:12,428 --> 00:06:16,553
has been sentenced to life imprisonment
by Thiruvarur Women's Bench.

39
00:06:16,752 --> 00:06:25,752
A fast-track women's court in Karur sentenced
the abuser of a 3 year old child...

40
00:06:26,002 --> 00:06:29,931
Police Department's
statistics state that nearly

41
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:33,997
92 women fall victim to
sexual assault everyday.

42
00:06:34,544 --> 00:06:37,460
Don't look at me that way. I'm
not going to rape you, okay?

43
00:06:38,002 --> 00:06:39,502
I didn't come here to rape you.

44
00:06:39,793 --> 00:06:42,085
Like you, I'm just a guy
taking refuge from the rain.

45
00:06:42,134 --> 00:06:43,883
A guy shivering in the rain.

46
00:06:44,377 --> 00:06:45,168
Okay?

47
00:06:46,252 --> 00:06:48,419
If you're feeling so
shivery, go down some shots.

48
00:06:48,669 --> 00:06:49,669
What a grumpus.

49
00:06:58,585 --> 00:06:59,294
What?

50
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:00,752
Why are you staring at my legs?

51
00:07:01,377 --> 00:07:04,419
Your legs aren't nice enough
to ogle at or admire.

52
00:07:04,918 --> 00:07:07,252
Be quiet. Don't pluck
words from my mouth.

53
00:07:08,043 --> 00:07:11,711
She wears a skirt and accuses me of
staring at her legs and her kegs.

54
00:07:11,876 --> 00:07:12,626
Shit.

55
00:07:15,418 --> 00:07:18,833
This car, that splashes
slush on them, is an Audi.

56
00:07:19,286 --> 00:07:21,869
It's not something you buy
in our Aadi season sale.

57
00:07:22,094 --> 00:07:24,219
'Cause the price of this
car is 15 million rupees.

58
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,601
But that's not the point.

59
00:07:25,784 --> 00:07:29,117
This car will end up killing
someone in five minutes.

60
00:07:32,078 --> 00:07:36,078
Unfazed by all this, the pouring rain
poured on. And it got them talking.

61
00:07:38,121 --> 00:07:40,121
The beautiful girl in the skirt.

62
00:07:41,568 --> 00:07:43,568
And the uncouth boy
with the beard.

63
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,270
What could he say?

64
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,531
He told his love story.

65
00:07:47,985 --> 00:07:49,985
You know, the same
old sympathy story.

66
00:07:52,585 --> 00:07:54,051
Name- Prabhunath.

67
00:07:54,076 --> 00:07:55,660
Education- M.A. in English.

68
00:07:55,876 --> 00:07:56,960
Hometown- Cooum.

69
00:07:57,497 --> 00:08:00,002
But unlike the stinky Cooum
river, I don't stink.

70
00:08:00,043 --> 00:08:05,460
The River Cooum, and I, didn't
stink till we reached Chennai.

71
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:09,711
When my father, the last of my
family in the town, died...

72
00:08:10,277 --> 00:08:12,694
with his farm dying
before he did...

73
00:08:13,085 --> 00:08:14,752
I came to Chennai
in search of a job.

74
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:18,043
Not North Chennai
or South Chennai.

75
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,560
I came to the Chennai
beyond Taramani.

76
00:08:20,585 --> 00:08:21,711
The New Chennai.

77
00:08:25,246 --> 00:08:28,246
Upon seeing that road, I
felt like I'd find a job.

78
00:08:28,848 --> 00:08:31,474
Because the road was named
after my dad's favourite...

79
00:08:31,585 --> 00:08:33,960
The Harbinger of
Revolution- M.G.R.

80
00:08:34,377 --> 00:08:35,294
M.G.R. Road.

81
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:39,752
'Who is the man, who feeds the whole
world? Who is he? Who is he?'

82
00:08:39,963 --> 00:08:44,085
'The Farmer...'

83
00:08:45,544 --> 00:08:47,252
I got a job at a call-center...

84
00:08:47,544 --> 00:08:49,502
a multi-national
company's call center.

85
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:51,933
Where I'd speak to people
of multiple-nationalities.

86
00:08:53,075 --> 00:08:56,294
Hi. Thanks for calling Janex. This
is Thomas. How can I help you, sir?

87
00:09:05,171 --> 00:09:09,776
'Is there a thing lacking
in our great nation?

88
00:09:09,957 --> 00:09:13,973
Why must we bow before
foreign nations?'

89
00:09:14,627 --> 00:09:22,669
'Toil hard in your farmland; And your
value will soar in faraway lands.'

90
00:09:23,168 --> 00:09:26,711
For a meagre 12 thousand,
my ears nearly bled.

91
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,752
I wish I had never
taken up this job.

92
00:09:29,002 --> 00:09:30,669
But there was a silver lining.

93
00:09:30,889 --> 00:09:32,889
In the building opposite
my office building...

94
00:09:33,085 --> 00:09:35,876
Sowmya worked as a software
engineer in an IT company.

95
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,627
The Exquisite Sowmya.

96
00:09:37,669 --> 00:09:40,419
If you're wondering what's
exquisite about her...

97
00:09:40,558 --> 00:09:44,793
she was the only traditionalist who wore
long tunics over her jeans in M.G.R Road.

98
00:09:44,835 --> 00:09:49,502
Not just that. She even covered
her upper body with a wrap.

99
00:09:49,711 --> 00:09:53,460
She even wore the
traditional saree.

100
00:09:54,214 --> 00:09:56,590
Only problem with her, was
that she cried often.

101
00:09:58,033 --> 00:09:59,575
You're crying today
also, Sowmya?

102
00:10:02,767 --> 00:10:06,350
My team leader asked me not
to wear saree often to work.

103
00:10:06,835 --> 00:10:09,168
In my office, they ask me
to shave off my beard.

104
00:10:09,398 --> 00:10:11,335
Is that something
worth crying over?

105
00:10:11,918 --> 00:10:12,876
You're shaving it off?

106
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:14,072
Does it look good?

107
00:10:14,168 --> 00:10:16,918
No. But you'd look
worse without it.

108
00:10:17,185 --> 00:10:18,477
Oh, I'll whack you!

109
00:10:18,681 --> 00:10:19,806
Yeah, right.

110
00:10:27,097 --> 00:10:28,348
I've got good news. - What?

111
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:31,627
They said I'll be sent to the
US to work on-site next month.

112
00:10:31,836 --> 00:10:33,793
Superb, Sowmya! Superb.

113
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:40,419
If I find another job there and settle
down, all my problems will be solved.

114
00:10:40,676 --> 00:10:41,509
Okay.

115
00:10:43,335 --> 00:10:45,335
But I'll need 300
thousand rupees for that.

116
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:47,999
Do you have it?

117
00:10:53,043 --> 00:10:54,043
Keep the money inside.

118
00:10:54,681 --> 00:10:55,639
How?

119
00:10:56,876 --> 00:10:58,168
This is nothing!

120
00:10:58,538 --> 00:11:01,766
If you ask for it, I'd even rob a bank
to get you 3 million in 3 minutes.

121
00:11:02,296 --> 00:11:03,835
Then why did it
take you 30 days?

122
00:11:04,001 --> 00:11:05,710
Sowmya, I'll whack you!

123
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,273
Thanks.

124
00:11:11,298 --> 00:11:14,673
Three hours later, she
departed from Chennai.

125
00:11:15,585 --> 00:11:16,876
I feel strange.

126
00:11:17,252 --> 00:11:20,002
I didn't feel like working.
Or eating. Or sleeping.

127
00:11:21,191 --> 00:11:25,650
Thank God for Skype! I don't know
what I'd have done without it.

128
00:11:26,168 --> 00:11:28,669
Exquisite Sowmya! You're
crying even in the U.S?

129
00:11:28,851 --> 00:11:31,502
I'm not able to sleep at nights.

130
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,095
You miss me too much?

131
00:11:33,627 --> 00:11:34,544
No.

132
00:11:35,669 --> 00:11:36,419
Jetlag.

133
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:37,335
Woman!

134
00:11:37,439 --> 00:11:39,377
I work night shifts at
a call-center, too.

135
00:11:39,587 --> 00:11:40,921
Is that something to cry about?

136
00:11:42,085 --> 00:11:43,793
You never cry for anything?

137
00:11:44,585 --> 00:11:46,585
Someday, I will make you cry.

138
00:11:47,335 --> 00:11:49,627
Okay, wipe those tears and go to sleep.
I'm sleepy.

139
00:11:49,627 --> 00:11:51,460
Wait! Don't fall asleep.

140
00:11:51,564 --> 00:11:52,439
Talk to me.

141
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,544
I'm sleepy now. Good night.

142
00:11:55,544 --> 00:11:59,585
Wait! Now my sleep-cycle is broken.
Please talk for a while longer.

143
00:11:59,921 --> 00:12:02,890
Go to sleep, Monkey. I've got
a long day ahead tomorrow.

144
00:12:02,915 --> 00:12:05,915
Don't be so selfish!
- You're the selfish one. Good night.

145
00:12:06,676 --> 00:12:07,634
Sowmya...

146
00:12:08,168 --> 00:12:09,002
Sowmya!

147
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:11,750
You've put on lipstick?

148
00:12:12,692 --> 00:12:13,692
Isn't it nice?

149
00:12:13,881 --> 00:12:15,544
You've changed your hairstyle?

150
00:12:15,876 --> 00:12:17,876
Yes, I can't braid my
hair all the time.

151
00:12:18,576 --> 00:12:19,909
What's with that top?

152
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:22,791
You're freaking out for that?
Now watch this...

153
00:12:23,014 --> 00:12:24,306
Tadah!

154
00:12:24,752 --> 00:12:26,043
Can't see?

155
00:12:26,252 --> 00:12:27,002
OH NO!

156
00:12:28,069 --> 00:12:35,528
My Exquisite Sowmya, the
traditionalist from M.G.R. Road...

157
00:12:35,798 --> 00:12:39,918
how did she change so suddenly
when she went to work abroad?

158
00:12:40,014 --> 00:12:41,514
I still don't believe it.

159
00:12:42,454 --> 00:12:45,162
Unlike our country where people
ogle at fully covered bodies...

160
00:12:45,316 --> 00:12:47,102
dressing down is not
a problem here.

161
00:12:47,127 --> 00:12:49,544
Prabhu, listen to me!

162
00:12:49,544 --> 00:12:51,793
I'm with a friend.
I'll call you later.

163
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:53,730
Please, Prabhu! Try
to understand.

164
00:12:53,755 --> 00:12:55,711
I've been calling you
for so many days!

165
00:12:55,752 --> 00:12:57,335
I told you I'd call you back.

166
00:12:57,587 --> 00:13:01,545
She said she'd call back. But it
took her several days to do so.

167
00:13:01,711 --> 00:13:02,460
Bye.

168
00:13:04,504 --> 00:13:05,835
You finally felt
like calling me?

169
00:13:05,835 --> 00:13:07,835
I have to say something.
Will you listen to me?

170
00:13:08,119 --> 00:13:08,531
Tell me.

171
00:13:08,556 --> 00:13:10,639
I couldn't find
another job here.

172
00:13:10,769 --> 00:13:13,306
I don't know how I'll
repay your 300 thousand.

173
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,544
There are problems at home, too.
- That's not a problem.

174
00:13:15,741 --> 00:13:17,116
Come back home. I'll handle it.

175
00:13:18,136 --> 00:13:21,043
I have something important to say
to you. Please don't get mad.

176
00:13:21,043 --> 00:13:21,752
What?

177
00:13:22,043 --> 00:13:24,252
I met somebody here.
He is an Indian.

178
00:13:24,335 --> 00:13:28,168
He wants to marry me. He
even has a citizenship here.

179
00:13:28,355 --> 00:13:30,669
Stop joking, Sowmya.
- I'm being serious.

180
00:13:31,035 --> 00:13:33,168
Let's be practical about it...

181
00:13:33,339 --> 00:13:34,548
Practical, my foot!

182
00:13:34,918 --> 00:13:36,918
Sowmya, listen to me.

183
00:13:37,095 --> 00:13:38,220
Come back. I'll handle it.

184
00:13:38,641 --> 00:13:41,002
I'll call you later, Prabhu.
I'm busy.

185
00:13:41,377 --> 00:13:42,335
Wait a minute, Sowmya!

186
00:13:43,006 --> 00:13:43,673
Hello?

187
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:46,627
Bitch.

188
00:13:50,809 --> 00:13:53,267
She never spoke
to me after that.

189
00:13:53,918 --> 00:13:55,711
Her phone stopped working.

190
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:58,377
The mails I sent
her bounced back.

191
00:13:59,377 --> 00:14:02,168
She'd gone beyond my coverage area.
She was lost to me.

192
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:09,460
I went where one went when
they have nowhere to go.

193
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,127
Railway Station- Taramani.

194
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,085
Stupid idiot!

195
00:14:44,406 --> 00:14:46,812
Had you fallen, you'd have
turned to gravy, you know?

196
00:14:46,837 --> 00:14:48,962
Like gooey masala gravy.
Get lost!

197
00:14:49,697 --> 00:14:50,781
Barnabas.

198
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,711
The night constable at
Taramani Railway station.

199
00:14:53,912 --> 00:14:57,168
He slapped me and dragged me away. And
thus became an elder brother to me.

200
00:14:57,294 --> 00:14:59,585
But to this day, I
address him as 'sir'.

201
00:15:00,513 --> 00:15:02,793
Felt awkward to call him
'brother', somehow.

202
00:15:03,893 --> 00:15:06,893
To keep him company, I started sleeping
in the railway station at nights.

203
00:15:06,957 --> 00:15:09,957
He showed me a small room, and
I built a new life there.

204
00:15:10,272 --> 00:15:11,855
And the beard grew longer.

205
00:15:12,063 --> 00:15:13,127
End of story.

206
00:15:16,709 --> 00:15:18,058
Bye.

207
00:15:30,085 --> 00:15:30,918
Hello!

208
00:15:31,506 --> 00:15:32,548
I'll push it for you?

209
00:15:34,502 --> 00:15:35,210
Okay.

210
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:44,180
This is the man that the Audi hit and
ran. Name - Ravi. Surname - Chamar.

211
00:15:44,205 --> 00:15:45,996
Hometown- Nawada. State- Bihar.

212
00:15:46,142 --> 00:15:49,517
Don't know when the last of his pulsating
life will abandon him forever.

213
00:15:49,637 --> 00:15:53,345
Don't know if the news of his death
will reach his wife and children.

214
00:15:53,469 --> 00:15:55,010
But that's not our problem.

215
00:15:55,524 --> 00:15:59,357
Let's stick to our story that started
at the building where he worked.

216
00:15:59,461 --> 00:16:00,586
See...

217
00:16:00,846 --> 00:16:04,513
Love is just a part of life.
You should celebrate life.

218
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,797
Be happy. Move on!

219
00:16:07,997 --> 00:16:10,414
I didn't share my story so
you could give me advice.

220
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,267
If not for you, I'd
have told my story to

221
00:16:13,292 --> 00:16:14,914
the bus-stand or this
rock or the rains.

222
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:16,260
I don't like advices.

223
00:16:16,325 --> 00:16:17,325
So...

224
00:16:18,427 --> 00:16:19,219
See...

225
00:16:19,498 --> 00:16:21,248
These days, after a break-up...

226
00:16:21,325 --> 00:16:24,992
you must get clean-shaved, take a nice
picture, upload it on Facebook...

227
00:16:25,463 --> 00:16:27,922
and change your relationship
status to 'Single'.

228
00:16:28,805 --> 00:16:30,805
This beard thing...

229
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,407
is very old-fashioned.

230
00:16:32,648 --> 00:16:34,939
This is not an advice.
Just an update.

231
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:37,260
Thanks a lot for the update.

232
00:16:37,536 --> 00:16:38,953
Madam, the vehicle is ready.

233
00:16:39,028 --> 00:16:39,945
Oh!

234
00:16:44,112 --> 00:16:44,987
Thanks.

235
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:55,088
Shall I drop you somewhere?

236
00:16:57,286 --> 00:16:59,411
I was just being polite!

237
00:17:00,064 --> 00:17:02,398
Even I offered to push your
vehicle out of politeness!

238
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:04,338
But you made me
push it for 2 kms!

239
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:05,263
Let's go.

240
00:17:11,853 --> 00:17:13,478
What you said is true.

241
00:17:13,963 --> 00:17:15,588
About the beard and everything.

242
00:17:16,081 --> 00:17:17,581
It's not just the break-up.

243
00:17:17,969 --> 00:17:19,969
I'm a thief.

244
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:23,635
The 300 thousand I gave her...?

245
00:17:23,974 --> 00:17:25,391
Did I tell you how I got it?

246
00:17:34,025 --> 00:17:34,859
Sir...

247
00:17:38,633 --> 00:17:39,508
Sir?

248
00:17:40,438 --> 00:17:41,354
Sir!

249
00:17:41,815 --> 00:17:42,690
Your money!

250
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,713
Sir...

251
00:18:07,489 --> 00:18:11,239
To steal is a great sin. But to steal
for someone else, is a greater sin.

252
00:18:11,492 --> 00:18:13,441
Stealing with the hope
that someone else

253
00:18:13,466 --> 00:18:15,557
would return the money
is the greatest sin.

254
00:18:16,148 --> 00:18:19,189
To this day, I haven't been
able to return the money.

255
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,576
Only when you steal,
you know the burden

256
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:25,487
of living your whole
life with the guilt.

257
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:30,981
When I was in second grade, I
stole an eraser from my friend.

258
00:18:31,977 --> 00:18:34,435
It was a pink, jasmine
scented eraser.

259
00:18:36,954 --> 00:18:38,954
Whether it's 3 rupees
or 300 thousand...

260
00:18:39,536 --> 00:18:40,828
stealing is stealing.

261
00:18:41,948 --> 00:18:43,740
I stole out of greed.

262
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,166
But you stole for need.

263
00:18:46,922 --> 00:18:47,838
Besides...

264
00:18:48,876 --> 00:18:50,626
you intended to return it.

265
00:18:51,716 --> 00:18:52,674
It's okay.

266
00:18:53,914 --> 00:18:55,664
Shit happens in life.

267
00:18:55,798 --> 00:18:57,048
You have to move on.

268
00:18:59,021 --> 00:19:00,563
I'm not just a thief.

269
00:19:01,323 --> 00:19:03,323
But a murderer, too.

270
00:19:03,606 --> 00:19:04,773
What?

271
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:09,836
After seeing Sowmya off at the airport, I
saw the newspaper later in the evening.

272
00:19:10,148 --> 00:19:15,273
A 65 year old man named Rahim has been
found dead at the Velachery train.

273
00:19:15,826 --> 00:19:19,451
The railway police suspect that he
may have suffered a heart attack.

274
00:19:20,705 --> 00:19:22,705
It was the heart attack
that killed him!

275
00:19:22,924 --> 00:19:25,258
He was sitting up when
I took the money.

276
00:19:26,062 --> 00:19:29,353
But in the newspaper
photograph, he was lying down.

277
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:32,123
Maybe...

278
00:19:34,029 --> 00:19:35,503
after I took the money...

279
00:19:36,927 --> 00:19:38,927
he woke up to find
that it's gone...

280
00:19:39,516 --> 00:19:40,682
and died from the shock?

281
00:19:41,099 --> 00:19:41,849
Then?

282
00:19:42,095 --> 00:19:44,095
I went to the Railway
Police Station.

283
00:19:44,518 --> 00:19:46,018
What do you want?

284
00:19:46,447 --> 00:19:48,447
Taking refuge from the rain.
- Okay, sit.

285
00:19:48,836 --> 00:19:50,409
Sir, Rahim Bhai...? - You are?

286
00:19:50,635 --> 00:19:53,302
He's my paternal uncle.
- Wait, the inspector will be here.

287
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:02,622
Where did you buy this?
It's all rice and no meat.

288
00:20:08,361 --> 00:20:10,361
Who is Rahim Bhai? - Sir...

289
00:20:12,565 --> 00:20:14,565
Check the belongings
and sign here.

290
00:20:18,073 --> 00:20:19,782
Mother, how much
money was there?

291
00:20:19,823 --> 00:20:21,198
500 thousand.

292
00:20:23,093 --> 00:20:23,884
Sir!

293
00:20:24,199 --> 00:20:24,805
Sir?

294
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:25,455
What?

295
00:20:25,786 --> 00:20:28,703
There should be 500 thousand.
Only 5000 is there.

296
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:30,149
So the money?

297
00:20:31,036 --> 00:20:33,953
Look, the thief has left a note!

298
00:20:34,117 --> 00:20:37,283
Forgive me, sir. I've
taken your 300 thousand.

299
00:20:37,401 --> 00:20:40,068
This money will change my life.

300
00:20:40,403 --> 00:20:42,570
I will return it
within three months.

301
00:20:42,672 --> 00:20:45,005
I've noted down your address.

302
00:20:45,103 --> 00:20:46,603
Forgive me. Yours
truly, Prabhunath.

303
00:20:46,646 --> 00:20:48,354
He has written his name, too.

304
00:20:48,483 --> 00:20:50,483
Must be a ballsy guy.

305
00:20:50,508 --> 00:20:52,049
Anyway, give me
that wad of cash.

306
00:20:52,721 --> 00:20:54,013
You pocketed a few notes?

307
00:20:54,038 --> 00:20:55,247
No, sir. 195 grand, intact.

308
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:58,458
Then, 75 grand for the inspector.
75 for the sub-inspector.

309
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:01,508
And we'll clear the rest
between the three of us.

310
00:21:03,514 --> 00:21:06,562
Thank the Almighty for paving the
way for this month's medical bills.

311
00:21:06,587 --> 00:21:07,503
Lord Easwara!

312
00:21:07,982 --> 00:21:09,524
To sum it up...

313
00:21:09,909 --> 00:21:13,993
Thieves steal from us. Police
steal from thieves AND us.

314
00:21:14,065 --> 00:21:18,940
And the hospitals steal from cop
and civilian alike, no disparity.

315
00:21:19,447 --> 00:21:21,031
Long live democracy!

316
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:22,607
Thanks.

317
00:21:22,721 --> 00:21:24,846
My house is this way. Yours?

318
00:21:24,973 --> 00:21:28,390
That's my room, with the asbestos,
next to the orange house...

319
00:21:28,443 --> 00:21:29,235
But...

320
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,403
why do you ask?

321
00:21:30,841 --> 00:21:33,424
I only told you my story because
you were a total stranger.

322
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:36,458
Even if we do stumble upon each other,
pretend like you don't know me.

323
00:21:36,573 --> 00:21:37,865
Please. Bye.

324
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:39,791
Hey...

325
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:42,065
I know you don't like advice...

326
00:21:42,393 --> 00:21:44,185
But here are three
pieces of advice.

327
00:21:44,924 --> 00:21:48,883
1- Don't tell your story
to random strangers.

328
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:51,766
There's no guarantee that everyone
will be a nice person like me.

329
00:21:52,213 --> 00:21:54,213
Oh. And?

330
00:21:54,273 --> 00:21:56,564
2- You weren't the only thief.

331
00:21:56,931 --> 00:21:58,556
Those cops did steal, too.

332
00:21:59,013 --> 00:22:00,555
So have I.

333
00:22:00,924 --> 00:22:03,123
Unwittingly or not,
everyone in this world

334
00:22:03,148 --> 00:22:05,448
might have been a cause
for another's death.

335
00:22:05,856 --> 00:22:08,189
So you should just--
- "Move on", shouldn't I?

336
00:22:08,214 --> 00:22:09,547
Okay. Bye.

337
00:22:09,779 --> 00:22:11,779
Wait. There's one more.

338
00:22:12,076 --> 00:22:12,951
What?

339
00:22:13,648 --> 00:22:15,273
Don't smoke from now.

340
00:22:15,423 --> 00:22:17,234
Why? Because I'll get cancer?

341
00:22:17,268 --> 00:22:19,268
No. Because you don't
know how to smoke.

342
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:20,704
That's why! Bye.

343
00:22:28,235 --> 00:22:31,462
When fishermen from Rameswaram
were fishing near Dhanushkodi...

344
00:22:31,487 --> 00:22:36,134
the Sri Lankan navy
launched an assault

345
00:22:36,231 --> 00:22:37,731
three fishermen were shot dead.

346
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,075
What are you looking at?

347
00:23:06,216 --> 00:23:08,216
Did you bring the cops?

348
00:23:08,528 --> 00:23:09,986
Why did you come here?

349
00:23:10,395 --> 00:23:13,103
Yesterday, you looked like some
derelict who hadn't eaten in days.

350
00:23:13,317 --> 00:23:14,984
See, you're attracting
all these flies.

351
00:23:15,096 --> 00:23:16,388
I was just passing by...

352
00:23:16,502 --> 00:23:18,502
thought I could bring
you some food.

353
00:23:18,982 --> 00:23:20,065
Thank you very much.

354
00:23:20,406 --> 00:23:22,406
Go to the station.
I'll see you there.

355
00:23:30,268 --> 00:23:32,143
The Indian Team has
leaped to victory.

356
00:23:32,479 --> 00:23:37,146
With this win, India move up to
the top spot in the ICC rankings.

357
00:23:42,659 --> 00:23:44,659
How can you just
come to my room?

358
00:23:44,836 --> 00:23:46,294
I'm not even paying for it.

359
00:23:46,454 --> 00:23:50,495
If it is known that a pretty girl like
you had come, I'll get thrown out.

360
00:23:50,802 --> 00:23:52,802
Not just that. I'm a guy.

361
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:54,052
A bearded guy.

362
00:23:54,359 --> 00:23:55,525
What if I did something to you?

363
00:23:57,068 --> 00:23:58,360
Why are you laughing?

364
00:24:00,283 --> 00:24:02,033
You can't do anything.

365
00:24:02,184 --> 00:24:02,976
What?

366
00:24:03,044 --> 00:24:03,669
Of course.

367
00:24:03,987 --> 00:24:07,154
You told a random girl on the
road, "I'm a thief, a murderer".

368
00:24:07,469 --> 00:24:10,177
"A girl dumped me.
I'm depressed."

369
00:24:10,521 --> 00:24:13,479
Who narrates his life history?
Please.

370
00:24:13,836 --> 00:24:15,461
You're an innocent fool.

371
00:24:16,617 --> 00:24:21,200
You're the first person who
said my legs aren't beautiful.

372
00:24:23,735 --> 00:24:24,568
Let's see.

373
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,325
Your legs are alright. Didn't
look that way yesterday.

374
00:24:29,883 --> 00:24:34,049
Especially the curve of your
hamstring and the bend of your knee.

375
00:24:34,548 --> 00:24:35,506
Superb.

376
00:24:37,698 --> 00:24:40,365
Don't talk this way. You
don't know about me.

377
00:24:42,435 --> 00:24:45,185
I wasn't coming to touch you.

378
00:24:45,503 --> 00:24:47,126
I would tell you first
before touching you.

379
00:24:47,392 --> 00:24:48,100
One minute.

380
00:24:50,229 --> 00:24:53,479
Althea Johnson. Human
Resource Manager. Dembos.

381
00:24:56,547 --> 00:24:58,380
Your height must
be around 5'11''?

382
00:24:59,227 --> 00:25:00,643
But you're wearing heels.

383
00:25:01,164 --> 00:25:02,664
You must be 5'9''.

384
00:25:04,033 --> 00:25:05,533
And weigh around 60 kgs?

385
00:25:07,549 --> 00:25:11,258
34 - 28 - 36

386
00:25:13,489 --> 00:25:15,353
Please. Don't talk this way.

387
00:25:15,432 --> 00:25:16,641
I'm already married.

388
00:25:16,857 --> 00:25:19,107
You lie so blatantly!

389
00:25:19,424 --> 00:25:21,049
Why do you think it's a lie?

390
00:25:22,158 --> 00:25:26,325
No married woman in Tamil
Nadu has a waist size of 28.

391
00:25:26,947 --> 00:25:28,406
They're all extra large.

392
00:25:28,911 --> 00:25:30,911
I wish I could be
extra large, too.

393
00:25:31,641 --> 00:25:34,849
To eat well, nap in the afternoons
and watch TV all the time.

394
00:25:35,959 --> 00:25:36,917
But I didn't get that.

395
00:25:37,776 --> 00:25:39,401
But I've got a nice little boy.

396
00:25:39,617 --> 00:25:40,617
I have a son.

397
00:25:41,817 --> 00:25:45,109
I didn't ask you to come to
my room or get me a sandwich.

398
00:25:45,275 --> 00:25:46,942
You came and spoke to me.

399
00:25:46,995 --> 00:25:49,204
Then why do you lie about a son?

400
00:25:49,313 --> 00:25:52,646
I'm not going to ask you out. I didn't
even think about us being friends.

401
00:25:52,971 --> 00:25:56,055
We're just strangers. Let's
better be strangers.

402
00:25:56,573 --> 00:25:57,740
Okay. Bye, Stranger.

403
00:26:00,895 --> 00:26:06,728
Wondering why a girl would listen to a
bearded man's sob story in pouring rain?

404
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,306
Even that's okay...

405
00:26:08,403 --> 00:26:13,320
Wondering why she'd knock on his
door and bring him a sandwich?

406
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:15,071
Maybe even that's plausible.

407
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:18,783
Wonder why a girl would
speak to a guy who

408
00:26:18,808 --> 00:26:23,478
comments on her figure,
rather than slap him?

409
00:26:24,228 --> 00:26:25,769
You would have
wondered, for sure.

410
00:26:26,271 --> 00:26:30,813
But none of you ever wondered why they
built so many structures on this wetland?

411
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,306
Then you must not wonder
about this either.

412
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:34,097
Is there a connection
between building in

413
00:26:34,122 --> 00:26:35,787
swamp and this love story?
Yes, there is.

414
00:26:35,821 --> 00:26:38,821
That's the story of
apples and oranges.

415
00:26:39,204 --> 00:26:44,120
If you see an apple, it's an apple.
If you see an orange, it's an orange.

416
00:26:45,554 --> 00:26:47,554
Hello, Stranger!

417
00:26:47,862 --> 00:26:49,862
Practising smoking, huh?

418
00:26:50,955 --> 00:26:53,110
When it started raining, I was
wondering if you'd turn up.

419
00:26:53,213 --> 00:26:54,630
And here you are. Welcome!

420
00:26:56,568 --> 00:26:58,068
Do you believe me at least now?

421
00:27:01,656 --> 00:27:02,572
My son.

422
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:04,696
Hi.

423
00:27:04,721 --> 00:27:05,804
Hi!

424
00:27:06,638 --> 00:27:08,638
Can I get a towel?
He's drenched.

425
00:27:08,775 --> 00:27:10,067
Come to my room.

426
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,908
How do you know Althea?

427
00:28:32,276 --> 00:28:33,568
I...

428
00:28:34,258 --> 00:28:35,508
No, I mean...

429
00:28:35,552 --> 00:28:38,219
Beardwala! Mommy is calling you.

430
00:29:51,549 --> 00:29:53,549
I'm going to touch that tree.

431
00:30:30,477 --> 00:30:36,018
Leave me down. Leave me down.
- Okay!

432
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,666
Okay, go.

433
00:30:39,314 --> 00:30:40,954
Do you know where my dad is?

434
00:30:41,127 --> 00:30:41,919
Where?

435
00:30:44,794 --> 00:30:46,419
He went into the sea.

436
00:30:46,654 --> 00:30:47,946
Why?

437
00:30:48,062 --> 00:30:49,728
To swim with the dolphins.

438
00:30:50,328 --> 00:30:51,494
When did he go?

439
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:58,940
Long, long, long back.

440
00:30:59,103 --> 00:31:00,437
How long?

441
00:31:05,497 --> 00:31:07,497
Long, long, long, long.

442
00:31:07,829 --> 00:31:09,360
100 years ago!

443
00:31:09,505 --> 00:31:11,005
What's your age then?

444
00:31:13,007 --> 00:31:15,188
One hundred and five!

445
00:31:15,344 --> 00:31:16,510
Really?

446
00:31:22,518 --> 00:31:23,935
You don't believe me?

447
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:25,360
I believe you, okay?

448
00:31:25,459 --> 00:31:27,334
Promise? - God promise.

449
00:31:38,363 --> 00:31:39,154
Stop it.

450
00:31:40,358 --> 00:31:42,858
How many time do I have to
tell you, Adrian? Stop it.

451
00:31:43,292 --> 00:31:45,542
Who gave you this ball?
- Stranger.

452
00:31:45,761 --> 00:31:46,660
Stranger?

453
00:31:47,317 --> 00:31:49,067
Beardwala!

454
00:31:49,175 --> 00:31:51,858
Beardwala? He is a
very bad man, Adrian.

455
00:31:52,175 --> 00:31:55,567
Don't take anything from him.

456
00:31:56,051 --> 00:31:57,608
He's a bad man.
- No, he's a good man!

457
00:31:57,759 --> 00:31:59,884
Bad man. - He's a good man.

458
00:32:00,278 --> 00:32:02,483
Listen, Adrian. He's evil.

459
00:32:03,106 --> 00:32:05,692
Mommy said he's a good man.

460
00:32:06,108 --> 00:32:07,733
Don't believe your mother.

461
00:32:08,121 --> 00:32:10,954
She is useless.
She'll never change.

462
00:32:11,379 --> 00:32:12,462
She is a bitch.

463
00:32:13,292 --> 00:32:14,167
Bitch means?

464
00:32:14,317 --> 00:32:15,983
Go ask your mother.

465
00:32:18,662 --> 00:32:19,746
Mommy...

466
00:32:20,326 --> 00:32:21,326
Mommy!

467
00:32:22,535 --> 00:32:23,826
What does bitch mean?

468
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:25,233
Who told you that?

469
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:29,942
Granny said you're a bitch.

470
00:32:30,233 --> 00:32:31,608
Bitch, bitch, bitch.

471
00:32:31,708 --> 00:32:33,208
Bitch, bitch, bitch.

472
00:32:33,233 --> 00:32:34,525
Bitch, bitch, bitch.

473
00:32:52,375 --> 00:32:55,192
You never sleep before me, dear!

474
00:32:55,358 --> 00:32:57,358
Okay, I'll hang up, then.

475
00:32:57,978 --> 00:32:59,478
Goodbye, dear.

476
00:33:00,048 --> 00:33:01,256
Oh, Jesus.

477
00:33:01,996 --> 00:33:03,787
It's been 20 years
since I got married.

478
00:33:04,439 --> 00:33:08,147
Even I may fall asleep on night
duty, but my Venus never does.

479
00:33:08,595 --> 00:33:12,262
This Barnabas is one
lucky man, what say?

480
00:33:12,894 --> 00:33:15,817
You say this every night.
I need a favour.

481
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:16,811
What?

482
00:33:17,621 --> 00:33:20,454
Althea has walked out of her house.
- Why?

483
00:33:20,868 --> 00:33:22,108
They spoke to her rudely.

484
00:33:22,305 --> 00:33:24,650
What did they say to
make her leave home?

485
00:33:29,375 --> 00:33:30,750
They called her a bitch.

486
00:33:30,923 --> 00:33:32,256
'Bitch' is like 'witch'?

487
00:33:34,025 --> 00:33:34,942
What?

488
00:33:36,801 --> 00:33:37,926
Slut.

489
00:33:38,326 --> 00:33:39,743
Disgusting. - Forget it, sir.

490
00:33:40,594 --> 00:33:42,594
She needs a place
to crash tonight.

491
00:33:44,163 --> 00:33:46,442
She'll leave to her friend's
place at 4:30 in the morning.

492
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:48,358
Can she be at the
station till then?

493
00:33:49,105 --> 00:33:53,105
Railway Station is the first place
for everyone with nowhere to go.

494
00:33:53,346 --> 00:33:54,608
Ask her to come.

495
00:33:54,712 --> 00:33:55,754
Thanks a lot, sir.

496
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:58,567
Why don't you marry that girl?

497
00:33:59,583 --> 00:34:00,375
What?

498
00:34:00,512 --> 00:34:05,008
You will marry the
conservative Venus from

499
00:34:05,509 --> 00:34:09,424
suburbs who waits on
you hand and foot...

500
00:34:09,986 --> 00:34:14,528
But I should marry a city girl who already
has a child from previous marriage?

501
00:34:15,514 --> 00:34:16,431
I'm not stupid.

502
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:20,067
What village girl - city girl?
A girl is just a girl.

503
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:23,108
Education seems to have
made these kids duller.

504
00:34:23,928 --> 00:34:26,553
But I can't fix him.

505
00:34:27,494 --> 00:34:31,400
Jesus is everything;
Jesus is my everything.

506
00:35:10,417 --> 00:35:12,625
Sorry, Thea. This is
all because of me.

507
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:14,650
Not at all.

508
00:35:15,595 --> 00:35:17,483
Really sorry. I mean it.

509
00:35:18,594 --> 00:35:19,511
It's okay.

510
00:35:25,519 --> 00:35:29,650
You lie down, then. I'll
be with Officer Baus.

511
00:35:30,856 --> 00:35:34,106
You're afraid? That I'll come
with you in the morning?

512
00:35:34,734 --> 00:35:37,442
Don't worry. I'll leave by 4:30.

513
00:35:37,965 --> 00:35:38,965
I promise.

514
00:35:39,673 --> 00:35:40,506
Sit.

515
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:54,567
You will never ask?

516
00:35:55,946 --> 00:35:56,779
What?

517
00:35:59,192 --> 00:36:02,650
The question that everyone asks me
within three minutes of seeing me.

518
00:36:03,733 --> 00:36:05,317
"Where is your husband?"

519
00:36:08,567 --> 00:36:11,192
You didn't say. I didn't ask.

520
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,400
To each person, I tell
a different story.

521
00:36:19,025 --> 00:36:22,275
That he's gone to Dubai.
Or Australia.

522
00:36:22,692 --> 00:36:24,192
Or the Moon.

523
00:36:25,152 --> 00:36:26,233
That he's passed away.

524
00:36:27,317 --> 00:36:29,317
That he went to swim
with the dolphins.

525
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:36,317
He believes the dolphin
story to be true.

526
00:36:41,337 --> 00:36:45,400
And the others pretend
to believe me.

527
00:36:52,879 --> 00:36:55,087
I should tell someone
the truth, shouldn't I?

528
00:36:58,981 --> 00:37:01,689
Three months after our
marriage, I found out...

529
00:37:18,564 --> 00:37:20,004
Why didn't you tell me?

530
00:37:20,567 --> 00:37:23,900
We've known each other since we
were kids. We're good friends.

531
00:37:41,691 --> 00:37:43,108
How could I, Thea?

532
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,858
What do you mean?

533
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:49,275
If I tell you, and my parents find out, I
was scared they would kill themselves.

534
00:37:50,595 --> 00:37:52,595
The first time I...

535
00:37:52,858 --> 00:37:55,233
I wanted to kill myself
when I realised it.

536
00:37:56,723 --> 00:37:58,514
In fact, I tried twice.

537
00:38:05,192 --> 00:38:06,525
Do you like me?

538
00:38:08,186 --> 00:38:09,181
A lot.

539
00:38:09,525 --> 00:38:11,817
No, as a woman.

540
00:38:12,025 --> 00:38:13,442
Do you like me like that?

541
00:38:16,775 --> 00:38:18,775
Tell me the truth, Jacob.
Please!

542
00:38:23,025 --> 00:38:24,192
Then...

543
00:38:25,192 --> 00:38:27,817
How did you sleep with
me all this time?

544
00:38:28,275 --> 00:38:29,900
It was more like masturbation.

545
00:38:30,272 --> 00:38:31,356
What did he say?

546
00:38:31,832 --> 00:38:35,207
Like fantasizing about someone
else and masturbating.

547
00:38:37,108 --> 00:38:38,692
Let us separate, Jacob.

548
00:38:40,317 --> 00:38:41,400
Yes, Thea.

549
00:38:41,525 --> 00:38:43,400
But what will we tell everyone?

550
00:38:43,547 --> 00:38:45,483
If people find out...

551
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:50,567
Tell them anything. Tell
them it's my fault.

552
00:38:51,192 --> 00:38:53,192
Tell them I'm of bad character.

553
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,900
That I had an affair
with my boss.

554
00:38:56,733 --> 00:38:58,317
Whatever pleases you.

555
00:38:59,902 --> 00:39:01,193
I could never, Thea.

556
00:39:03,334 --> 00:39:04,709
About you, that too.

557
00:39:05,608 --> 00:39:06,983
It's fine, Jacob.

558
00:39:08,192 --> 00:39:09,567
I can understand.

559
00:39:13,028 --> 00:39:14,317
It's not a sin.

560
00:39:15,457 --> 00:39:17,123
And it's not your fault.

561
00:39:21,358 --> 00:39:22,817
I like you a lot.

562
00:39:24,358 --> 00:39:25,650
You're a good man.

563
00:39:27,817 --> 00:39:29,525
This is not your fault, Jacob.

564
00:39:30,108 --> 00:39:31,442
You're a good soul.

565
00:39:32,317 --> 00:39:33,525
That's fine.

566
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:35,358
But why didn't you
say the truth?

567
00:39:35,858 --> 00:39:37,567
Why did you do bring
this upon yourself?

568
00:39:39,817 --> 00:39:41,192
It's okay for me.

569
00:39:41,233 --> 00:39:43,608
I'm a straight woman. I
will get on with life.

570
00:39:45,025 --> 00:39:47,025
But no one will understand him.

571
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:49,900
Even you don't
understand, right?

572
00:39:52,108 --> 00:39:53,192
That's why.

573
00:39:54,304 --> 00:39:55,900
Does he know about the son?

574
00:39:58,108 --> 00:39:59,025
He doesn't.

575
00:40:00,775 --> 00:40:03,275
I found out about Adrian
only after he left.

576
00:40:05,248 --> 00:40:06,873
My naughty little imp.

577
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,483
Do you know where he is now?

578
00:40:13,275 --> 00:40:14,025
I do.

579
00:40:15,774 --> 00:40:18,316
In this same planet, somewhere.

580
00:40:20,108 --> 00:40:22,108
Maybe he's swimming
with dolphins.

581
00:40:23,775 --> 00:40:25,400
Or flown to the moon.

582
00:40:26,162 --> 00:40:27,787
Or gone to Australia.

583
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,567
Must be around, somewhere.

584
00:40:35,442 --> 00:40:36,525
Sorry, Thea.

585
00:40:38,608 --> 00:40:40,525
Why do you feel sorry?

586
00:40:43,442 --> 00:40:44,733
Even I don't.

587
00:40:47,126 --> 00:40:49,126
I'm sleepy. I'll sleep now.

588
00:40:49,817 --> 00:40:51,358
Wake me up at 4 AM, please.

589
00:40:52,048 --> 00:40:56,840
I don't need to bother. The 4
AM train will wake you up.

590
00:40:57,317 --> 00:40:58,358
Sleep peacefully.

591
00:40:58,983 --> 00:41:00,108
Good night.

592
00:41:00,733 --> 00:41:01,692
I'll be over there.

593
00:41:02,025 --> 00:41:04,025
Yeah, good night. - Good night.

594
00:42:25,766 --> 00:42:27,308
Hi, morning! - Hi.

595
00:42:27,333 --> 00:42:29,233
I'm so sorry we're late.
- No worries.

596
00:42:29,392 --> 00:42:31,767
They've only given the keys to three
rooms. Their stuff is in the other rooms.

597
00:42:31,817 --> 00:42:33,275
Thank you. - Okay, see you then.

598
00:42:33,379 --> 00:42:34,442
Bye. - Bye!

599
00:42:34,525 --> 00:42:35,650
Say bye. - Bye.

600
00:42:47,817 --> 00:42:49,442
Whose house is this?

601
00:42:50,608 --> 00:42:51,733
My friend Gautham.

602
00:42:51,983 --> 00:42:53,983
He bought this house
and left to Canada.

603
00:42:54,179 --> 00:42:57,650
I said I'll stay for a few days. He said
I could stay for free for six months.

604
00:42:58,746 --> 00:43:01,037
If it's free, can
I stay here too?

605
00:43:01,483 --> 00:43:04,025
No, it's too complicated.

606
00:43:04,214 --> 00:43:06,900
Please, mom. Let him stay here.

607
00:43:07,118 --> 00:43:10,035
I love this Beardwala!

608
00:43:10,426 --> 00:43:11,967
Please, mom. Please.

609
00:43:13,817 --> 00:43:14,817
Okay.

610
00:43:18,817 --> 00:43:19,983
Thank you, young man.

611
00:43:20,233 --> 00:43:21,650
Welcome, old man.

612
00:43:22,692 --> 00:43:24,108
I'll go get the bags.

613
00:43:24,483 --> 00:43:25,525
Bye. - Bye!

614
00:43:29,858 --> 00:43:32,025
Okay, let's get you
ready for school.

615
00:43:32,335 --> 00:43:33,667
Come on. - No school.

616
00:43:33,742 --> 00:43:36,317
No, you have to go to school.
Get up. Get up!

617
00:43:36,537 --> 00:43:37,454
No!

618
00:43:41,983 --> 00:43:46,942
Before these people came here,
before this house sprung up here...

619
00:43:47,233 --> 00:43:52,150
since the time this place was a marshy
field, this pigeon has been visiting here.

620
00:43:52,733 --> 00:44:00,608
It goes in search of it's partner,
to speak of the lost marshy fields.

621
00:44:07,733 --> 00:44:08,817
Hi. - Hi!

622
00:44:09,525 --> 00:44:11,525
Thanks for bringing the suitcase.
- It's okay.

623
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:15,442
I made some tea. - Fine.

624
00:44:18,741 --> 00:44:19,700
Here.

625
00:44:21,355 --> 00:44:22,567
Where is Adrian?

626
00:44:22,698 --> 00:44:23,900
He's gone to school.

627
00:44:31,317 --> 00:44:32,483
I need to say something.

628
00:44:33,032 --> 00:44:33,858
What?

629
00:44:34,192 --> 00:44:35,817
I'm in love with you. - What?

630
00:44:36,556 --> 00:44:37,973
I said I'm in love with you.

631
00:44:50,238 --> 00:44:53,154
If you have such thoughts, get
out of this place immediately.

632
00:44:53,858 --> 00:44:55,400
Have I said something wrong?

633
00:44:58,525 --> 00:45:00,525
My son is my only
priority in life.

634
00:45:02,858 --> 00:45:04,858
Then why tell me everything?

635
00:45:07,025 --> 00:45:09,442
Before you came along, I
was talking to my scooter.

636
00:45:09,525 --> 00:45:11,108
Then I talked to you.

637
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:12,233
That's all.

638
00:45:14,029 --> 00:45:15,446
So I'm like that scooter?

639
00:45:17,775 --> 00:45:20,650
No. You are lesser
than my scooter.

640
00:45:21,185 --> 00:45:21,894
Okay?

641
00:45:41,884 --> 00:45:43,217
Serves me right!

642
00:45:44,162 --> 00:45:45,329
So humiliating.

643
00:45:56,608 --> 00:45:57,900
You haven't left?

644
00:46:01,942 --> 00:46:02,983
I need five minutes.

645
00:46:13,927 --> 00:46:15,386
You're panting so hard!

646
00:46:15,411 --> 00:46:19,619
The elevator wasn't working. I
climbed up and down 28 levels.

647
00:46:20,267 --> 00:46:21,817
Let us be friends.

648
00:46:21,858 --> 00:46:22,817
I'll think about it.

649
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:29,317
You shouldn't smoke.

650
00:46:29,622 --> 00:46:30,580
Why?

651
00:46:31,438 --> 00:46:33,438
Because you are the
mother of a child.

652
00:46:34,123 --> 00:46:34,915
So?

653
00:46:35,068 --> 00:46:36,860
You are the son to some mother.

654
00:46:38,192 --> 00:46:39,192
My life is difficult.

655
00:46:39,733 --> 00:46:41,108
My future looks bad.

656
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:43,879
The girl I proposed
to, didn't like me.

657
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:47,108
My life is difficult, too.

658
00:46:47,192 --> 00:46:48,275
I have a bad past.

659
00:46:48,844 --> 00:46:51,344
And I don't like any of the
men who have proposed to me.

660
00:47:02,983 --> 00:47:04,233
We'll be friends.

661
00:47:04,650 --> 00:47:05,317
Okay.

662
00:47:07,733 --> 00:47:09,233
You don't know
anything about me.

663
00:47:09,942 --> 00:47:11,442
You don't even
know that I smoke.

664
00:47:12,275 --> 00:47:14,608
Suppose I cheat on
you, like that girl?

665
00:47:15,173 --> 00:47:16,256
I'll kill you.

666
00:47:17,154 --> 00:47:20,238
Killing can wait. First
shave off this beard.

667
00:50:10,587 --> 00:50:13,462
Can I call Beardwala 'dad'?

668
00:51:26,506 --> 00:51:27,756
I love you.

669
00:51:40,783 --> 00:51:45,950
When a girl tells a guy 'I love
you', what would he do next?

670
00:51:49,979 --> 00:51:52,520
He'll drop her at work
the very next day.

671
00:51:52,604 --> 00:51:54,395
Okay, I'm late. Bye. - Bye.

672
00:51:55,087 --> 00:51:57,301
He'll promptly pick her
up in the evening.

673
00:52:03,062 --> 00:52:03,979
Superb.

674
00:52:04,437 --> 00:52:07,270
He'll master 'ing' verbs that
don't have words in Tamil yet:

675
00:52:07,312 --> 00:52:10,937
such as, packing, body
guarding, shopping.

676
00:52:11,943 --> 00:52:15,491
As a reward for it, he may occasionally
win an upper body garment.

677
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:17,479
No. - Why?

678
00:52:17,838 --> 00:52:20,504
Poor chap. Today is not his day.

679
00:52:23,736 --> 00:52:28,402
He'd sit at glass-doored coffee houses
with wistful dreams about the future.

680
00:52:29,347 --> 00:52:31,347
There is a walk-in
interview at DCS BPO.

681
00:52:31,854 --> 00:52:32,937
10 AM.

682
00:52:34,062 --> 00:52:37,437
You don't have to work at a BPO!
I've got a job.

683
00:52:37,604 --> 00:52:40,145
Do your MBA from home.
You'll find a good job.

684
00:52:42,270 --> 00:52:46,097
He would master the art
of spying on her phone

685
00:52:46,122 --> 00:52:49,378
under the guise of
sipping fruit juice.

686
00:52:49,586 --> 00:52:52,270
Sarah has invited for a party tomorrow.
2 o clock.

687
00:52:52,983 --> 00:52:54,108
You really need to go?

688
00:52:56,604 --> 00:52:58,312
Fine, I won't. Okay?

689
00:52:58,938 --> 00:52:59,854
Okay.

690
00:53:02,939 --> 00:53:03,980
Where are you going now?

691
00:53:04,229 --> 00:53:05,437
To the toilet!

692
00:53:05,770 --> 00:53:08,270
May I go there?
- Have a nice trip.

693
00:53:09,094 --> 00:53:14,062
A week later, he would embrace her in
front of the ocean and exchange kisses.

694
00:53:15,687 --> 00:53:21,812
A week after that, he'd gently lead her
into the bedroom and shut the door.

695
00:53:24,187 --> 00:53:28,937
This amazing lover, after
all that, would ask her...

696
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:33,979
How do you have 2,248
friends on Facebook?

697
00:53:38,479 --> 00:53:39,270
Why?

698
00:53:39,431 --> 00:53:41,431
I only have fifteen friends!

699
00:53:42,895 --> 00:53:44,895
What can I do if you
don't make any friends?

700
00:53:47,369 --> 00:53:49,270
Who is this Arun K Vishwa?

701
00:53:50,937 --> 00:53:52,937
Don't know. Must be
some friend's friend.

702
00:53:54,729 --> 00:53:59,604
He has commented on your photo
saying, 'You look gorgeous'.

703
00:54:00,062 --> 00:54:00,854
So?

704
00:54:01,562 --> 00:54:03,562
But a total stranger...

705
00:54:04,015 --> 00:54:06,557
Wouldn't you like it if
someone called you beautiful?

706
00:54:06,957 --> 00:54:08,145
So you like it?

707
00:54:08,270 --> 00:54:09,479
Of course I like it.

708
00:54:09,645 --> 00:54:11,645
He will encounter
many such surprises.

709
00:54:12,303 --> 00:54:13,470
Your skirt...

710
00:54:14,270 --> 00:54:16,270
Yes, it's a skirt.

711
00:54:17,937 --> 00:54:21,604
Instead of wearing one this short,
wear one that falls below your knees?

712
00:54:22,437 --> 00:54:23,395
Why?

713
00:54:23,770 --> 00:54:26,946
Everyone might look at
you with bad intent.

714
00:54:27,187 --> 00:54:28,145
Would you?

715
00:54:28,187 --> 00:54:30,979
I wouldn't! But others will.

716
00:54:31,437 --> 00:54:34,979
Don't talk about my skirt. I know
how to dress and carry myself.

717
00:54:35,371 --> 00:54:38,187
Don't start a fight over it.
- No, I was just saying...

718
00:54:38,229 --> 00:54:39,145
Then...

719
00:54:40,908 --> 00:54:42,574
Happy birthday, Thea.

720
00:54:48,062 --> 00:54:49,520
Don't go to work today?

721
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:51,578
Don't start.

722
00:54:52,621 --> 00:54:54,705
I told you already,
I must go to work.

723
00:54:56,812 --> 00:54:59,062
No. You're spending
the day with me.

724
00:55:03,687 --> 00:55:04,812
Then...

725
00:55:12,117 --> 00:55:12,992
Say it.

726
00:55:13,270 --> 00:55:14,229
What?

727
00:55:15,062 --> 00:55:18,062
You always say important
things in the elevator.

728
00:55:18,395 --> 00:55:19,979
Isn't that why you've come?

729
00:55:20,776 --> 00:55:21,734
Say it.

730
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:27,562
I saw your birthday pictures
from last year on Facebook.

731
00:55:28,697 --> 00:55:32,437
I saw you cutting a cake
with random colleagues...

732
00:55:33,511 --> 00:55:35,511
hugging and getting
gifts from them.

733
00:55:37,584 --> 00:55:39,584
So I thought, this year,
you could be with me...?

734
00:55:41,042 --> 00:55:43,354
Is this why you asked
me to take the day off?

735
00:55:45,229 --> 00:55:49,187
Look, I didn't share my Facebook
password so that you could spy on me.

736
00:55:49,929 --> 00:55:50,929
Grow up.

737
00:55:51,784 --> 00:55:54,062
No. I'm sorry, Thea!
- It's fine. Let it go.

738
00:55:56,050 --> 00:55:57,300
Sorry, Thea.

739
00:55:57,831 --> 00:55:58,665
It's fine.

740
00:55:59,146 --> 00:56:01,063
Just leave it.
- I didn't mean to hurt you.

741
00:56:01,088 --> 00:56:02,171
It's okay.

742
00:56:04,062 --> 00:56:05,062
Then...

743
00:56:11,541 --> 00:56:12,499
Hi!

744
00:56:13,479 --> 00:56:14,158
Where is Adrian?

745
00:56:14,183 --> 00:56:16,132
I dropped him at his
friend's place.

746
00:56:17,241 --> 00:56:19,137
Althea!
- So the party went well?

747
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:20,545
Althea!

748
00:56:21,222 --> 00:56:23,972
I think someone is calling you.

749
00:56:27,229 --> 00:56:29,229
It's my boss. - Oh, boss?

750
00:56:31,312 --> 00:56:33,312
Two minutes? - Carry on then.

751
00:57:01,139 --> 00:57:04,084
You're unwrapping my gift in the
middle of the road like Adrian!

752
00:57:04,109 --> 00:57:05,317
Are you a kid ot what?

753
00:57:05,579 --> 00:57:08,620
Oh, yes. All this happens to
me because I'm like Adrian.

754
00:57:08,645 --> 00:57:09,479
What?

755
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:11,187
Read what's witten here.

756
00:57:12,979 --> 00:57:14,812
'Hope this fits you.' So?

757
00:57:15,035 --> 00:57:16,202
What does that mean?

758
00:57:17,707 --> 00:57:18,957
Don't you know what it means?

759
00:57:19,525 --> 00:57:20,812
What does it mean?

760
00:57:21,437 --> 00:57:24,145
Don't behave like this outside
my office for everyone to see.

761
00:57:24,145 --> 00:57:25,270
What does it mean, Althea?

762
00:57:25,395 --> 00:57:27,062
He's asking if it's my size.
Enough?

763
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:29,520
Oh. How does he know?

764
00:57:30,038 --> 00:57:32,979
Prabhu, please. It's my birthday.
Don't ruin my birthday.

765
00:57:33,062 --> 00:57:36,687
How does he know?
- Prabhu, not in the road!

766
00:57:37,041 --> 00:57:40,124
How does he know, Althea?
- I don't know, go ask him.

767
00:57:40,631 --> 00:57:42,589
Oh. It's that
Gopalakrishnan, right?

768
00:57:42,699 --> 00:57:43,991
Ask him to come here.
I'll ask him.

769
00:57:44,184 --> 00:57:45,309
Let's go, Prabhu.

770
00:57:45,395 --> 00:57:48,437
He's at your office upstairs?
Will you ask him or shall I?

771
00:57:50,542 --> 00:57:51,333
Shit.

772
00:57:54,979 --> 00:57:57,062
Althea, wait.

773
00:57:57,937 --> 00:57:59,979
Althea, stop. Listen to me.

774
00:58:00,791 --> 00:58:02,666
Althea, please. Listen to me.

775
00:58:03,354 --> 00:58:05,479
Get on to the scooter. Please.

776
00:58:05,957 --> 00:58:07,957
I won't bring this up again.
Get on the scooter.

777
00:58:08,605 --> 00:58:11,064
Promise?
- I promise I won't talk about it.

778
00:58:15,979 --> 00:58:16,770
Let's go?

779
00:58:17,270 --> 00:58:17,895
Yeah.

780
00:58:25,991 --> 00:58:27,562
What did your boss say?

781
00:58:29,230 --> 00:58:31,230
He said 'Happy birthday'.

782
00:58:31,270 --> 00:58:33,270
He had to hug you on
the road to say that?

783
00:58:34,062 --> 00:58:37,229
Look, I'm not Adrian to
believe all your lies.

784
00:58:37,379 --> 00:58:40,588
It's normal in corporate culture
to hug your boss. And that's fine.

785
00:58:40,645 --> 00:58:42,645
But I felt possessive.
I'll let that go, too.

786
00:58:42,770 --> 00:58:47,062
Tell me what this note means.
Come on, tell me.

787
00:58:47,145 --> 00:58:49,812
The signal is on. Go now.
- Signal, my foot.

788
00:58:56,437 --> 00:58:58,437
Please don't test my patience.
Answer me.

789
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:02,520
How did he have the guts
to write such a thing?

790
00:59:04,645 --> 00:59:06,229
Are you that close with him?

791
00:59:06,753 --> 00:59:08,087
Tell me, woman!

792
00:59:09,229 --> 00:59:11,062
How does he know your size?

793
00:59:13,434 --> 00:59:16,226
How does he know your size?
Answer me.

794
00:59:18,770 --> 00:59:22,645
You always shut me up by saying
our lifestyles are different.

795
00:59:22,687 --> 00:59:26,979
Tell me, how does he know your size?
- Look, pull over. Pull over!

796
00:59:27,132 --> 00:59:28,799
Open your mouth, woman.
- Stop or I'll jump!

797
00:59:28,889 --> 00:59:30,347
Jump, then.

798
00:59:31,229 --> 00:59:32,229
Get lost!

799
01:00:04,188 --> 01:00:06,854
Thea, please don't cry. Please.

800
01:00:06,937 --> 01:00:10,187
I'm sorry, Thea. I
didn't mean to do that.

801
01:00:10,442 --> 01:00:12,651
I've made a mistake.
Please forgive me, Thea.

802
01:00:13,249 --> 01:00:14,874
I couldn't control it, Thea.

803
01:00:15,288 --> 01:00:17,770
Please don't cry.
Please, please!

804
01:00:17,812 --> 01:00:18,979
Just stop, okay?

805
01:00:19,645 --> 01:00:22,479
The door was open. I thought
you had left. That's all.

806
01:00:22,812 --> 01:00:24,062
Thea, where would I go?

807
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:26,437
If you're leaving, just
tell me first. Okay?

808
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:29,119
I've never loved anyone
in my life so much.

809
01:00:29,364 --> 01:00:30,604
Or depended on them.

810
01:00:30,715 --> 01:00:31,882
Or trusted so much.

811
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:34,979
I depend on you so much I
only hate myself for it.

812
01:00:35,427 --> 01:00:38,270
Thea, you're everything to me.

813
01:00:38,385 --> 01:00:43,495
When a girl tells a guy
that she loves him,

814
01:00:43,965 --> 01:00:49,325
depends on him, trusts
him, what will he do next?

815
01:00:51,053 --> 01:00:51,729
Hi!

816
01:00:52,197 --> 01:00:53,280
Hi!

817
01:00:54,604 --> 01:00:57,437
Who drew this?
- Beardwala and I.

818
01:00:57,783 --> 01:00:58,824
Really?

819
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:00,682
Who is this?

820
01:01:00,979 --> 01:01:01,979
This is Beardwala!

821
01:01:02,229 --> 01:01:03,895
And this? - This is me.

822
01:01:04,204 --> 01:01:05,204
This is you.

823
01:01:05,229 --> 01:01:06,437
Me?

824
01:01:07,479 --> 01:01:08,437
And this?

825
01:01:08,798 --> 01:01:10,214
This is our sweet home.

826
01:01:10,449 --> 01:01:11,533
Wow!

827
01:01:12,479 --> 01:01:13,437
Very good, baby!

828
01:01:13,846 --> 01:01:16,579
So mommy is going
to Delhi tomorrow.

829
01:01:16,651 --> 01:01:18,484
Will you stay with Beardwala?
- Okay!

830
01:01:18,817 --> 01:01:20,401
I love Beardwala!

831
01:01:20,812 --> 01:01:22,270
You're going to Delhi tomorrow?

832
01:01:22,432 --> 01:01:23,687
An official trip with my boss.

833
01:01:26,517 --> 01:01:27,558
Then...

834
01:01:28,986 --> 01:01:30,520
Good morning. - Good morning!

835
01:01:30,744 --> 01:01:33,395
As usual, your boyfriend has
called on the landline four times.

836
01:01:33,437 --> 01:01:34,937
Go. Give your attendance.

837
01:01:52,354 --> 01:01:53,187
Hello.

838
01:01:53,562 --> 01:01:55,562
You know I'll call as soon
as I reach the office.

839
01:01:55,979 --> 01:01:58,312
What was the hurry? Why do
you call so many times?

840
01:01:58,608 --> 01:02:00,108
You left your phone behind.

841
01:02:01,846 --> 01:02:02,637
Sorry.

842
01:02:03,807 --> 01:02:06,932
Can you put my phone on charge? I may
not have time before the flight.

843
01:02:07,170 --> 01:02:10,395
I live to charge your phone, carry
water cans and iron your clothes.

844
01:02:10,497 --> 01:02:11,247
Huh?

845
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:13,562
Your boss has sent a text.

846
01:02:13,854 --> 01:02:15,437
Oh. Saying what?

847
01:02:16,895 --> 01:02:20,479
To put it in civilised English, "Shall we
extend our trip to Kulu Manali for two days?'

848
01:02:20,604 --> 01:02:24,187
In uncivilised Tamil, "Will you
sleep with me in Kulu Manali?"

849
01:02:24,668 --> 01:02:26,252
And you're going
to Delhi with him?

850
01:02:30,908 --> 01:02:32,491
What's his problem today?

851
01:02:32,976 --> 01:02:34,101
It's nothing.

852
01:02:42,354 --> 01:02:43,979
I'm going to Delhi, right?

853
01:02:44,580 --> 01:02:47,746
And our stupid boss has sent
a disgusting text as usual.

854
01:02:48,229 --> 01:02:50,270
And my boyfriend read it. So...

855
01:02:50,295 --> 01:02:52,379
What? He checked your mobile?

856
01:02:52,741 --> 01:02:56,437
So cheap! If my husband had even touched
my mobile, I'd have chopped them off.

857
01:02:56,910 --> 01:02:59,910
If you give him so much
space, he will control you.

858
01:03:00,124 --> 01:03:01,541
The mistake is all yours.

859
01:03:03,057 --> 01:03:03,890
No.

860
01:03:04,812 --> 01:03:07,604
His lifestyle is different.
He won't understand all this.

861
01:03:08,901 --> 01:03:10,068
You keep saying that.

862
01:03:10,147 --> 01:03:11,689
Hi, Vishwa! - Good morning.

863
01:03:11,770 --> 01:03:13,270
Good morning. - Morning!

864
01:03:14,762 --> 01:03:15,645
Pick up the damned phone!

865
01:03:23,908 --> 01:03:25,116
Want to go for a coffee?

866
01:03:25,423 --> 01:03:26,048
Now?

867
01:03:26,145 --> 01:03:27,062
Let's go.

868
01:03:27,262 --> 01:03:29,054
Pick up the phone, woman.
Pick up.

869
01:03:32,814 --> 01:03:34,270
Hello. - Don't hang up!

870
01:03:34,389 --> 01:03:35,222
I won't.

871
01:03:35,562 --> 01:03:38,270
Why do you torture me when I'm at work?
What do you want?

872
01:03:38,270 --> 01:03:40,270
He's sent such a disgusting text.
Don't go with him.

873
01:03:40,645 --> 01:03:42,645
What do you care whether
or not I go with him?

874
01:03:43,145 --> 01:03:46,437
He is being so cheap!
- Is that your problem?

875
01:03:46,562 --> 01:03:49,937
I get to decide whether or not I
will sleep with him. Not him.

876
01:03:50,062 --> 01:03:51,062
Get that?

877
01:03:51,062 --> 01:03:52,812
Listen--
- No, you listen...

878
01:03:52,890 --> 01:03:54,765
I've been on this
job for ten years.

879
01:03:54,895 --> 01:03:56,895
I know how to handle these men.

880
01:03:57,171 --> 01:04:00,088
I know how to take care of myself.
I don't need a bodyguard.

881
01:04:00,354 --> 01:04:01,645
If that's fine, be my lover.

882
01:04:01,815 --> 01:04:02,854
No, you listen to me.

883
01:04:02,949 --> 01:04:06,533
You don't need to say anything. I
have a lot of work, and a meeting.

884
01:04:07,554 --> 01:04:08,512
I'll call you later.

885
01:04:08,579 --> 01:04:10,829
Don't you dare hang up!
I'll jump from the tower.

886
01:04:10,854 --> 01:04:12,729
Fine, jump if you want to.

887
01:04:12,835 --> 01:04:13,585
Stupid.

888
01:04:35,437 --> 01:04:37,229
Did you send me a text?

889
01:04:37,855 --> 01:04:38,647
What?

890
01:04:38,812 --> 01:04:40,520
Did you or did you not?

891
01:04:41,369 --> 01:04:43,699
Yes, what's wrong in that?

892
01:04:44,081 --> 01:04:45,687
What's wrong in that?

893
01:04:46,312 --> 01:04:49,937
There's nothing wrong. You're the
perfect gentleman in this office.

894
01:04:50,145 --> 01:04:52,312
What are you saying?
- Everybody, listen up.

895
01:04:52,701 --> 01:04:56,229
Mr. Ankit is the nicest
guy in the entire office.

896
01:04:56,479 --> 01:04:58,562
Let's talk in my cabin.
- Get your hands off me.

897
01:04:58,783 --> 01:05:00,783
Come, Althea.
- Get your hands off, man!

898
01:05:01,662 --> 01:05:02,954
You moron.

899
01:05:02,979 --> 01:05:06,145
Not just Delhi, I wouldn't even
ride the elevator with you.

900
01:05:07,145 --> 01:05:08,687
You and your sucky job.

901
01:05:14,354 --> 01:05:16,354
You want to fire me? Go ahead.

902
01:05:21,340 --> 01:05:22,299
Relax.

903
01:05:22,598 --> 01:05:24,598
There is a lot of
stress in our office.

904
01:05:25,729 --> 01:05:29,229
I think everyone here needs a
psychological counselling.

905
01:05:29,922 --> 01:05:33,270
Everybody focus on your jobs.
Back to work!

906
01:05:33,842 --> 01:05:35,842
What's going on here? Tell me.

907
01:05:46,937 --> 01:05:48,937
What? - Are you going to Delhi?

908
01:05:50,810 --> 01:05:52,687
What is it to you?

909
01:05:52,729 --> 01:05:55,979
I've packed my bags, Thea. If
you're going, I'm moving out.

910
01:05:56,145 --> 01:05:57,479
Damn it! Fine, go.

911
01:05:59,072 --> 01:06:00,238
Wait, Thea.

912
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:02,145
I really will move
out of the house.

913
01:06:02,586 --> 01:06:05,062
Fine, go one then. The
door is over there.

914
01:06:05,312 --> 01:06:07,395
You asked me to tell
you before going!

915
01:06:07,467 --> 01:06:09,467
You've told me now.
You've told me.

916
01:06:09,766 --> 01:06:10,724
Get lost.

917
01:06:10,749 --> 01:06:12,207
Stop, Thea. Stop!

918
01:06:12,580 --> 01:06:16,062
I'm talking to you, and
you'd just walk away?

919
01:06:19,009 --> 01:06:21,270
Do I look like scum to you? Huh?

920
01:06:21,270 --> 01:06:23,270
Yes, you are. You're scum.

921
01:06:23,837 --> 01:06:27,770
Some random man texts you asking to
go to Manali, and it's my fault?

922
01:06:28,009 --> 01:06:30,009
Am I wrong for questioning it?

923
01:06:30,198 --> 01:06:32,437
Who are you to question me?
Who are you?

924
01:06:32,590 --> 01:06:33,507
Who am I?

925
01:06:33,953 --> 01:06:34,745
Who am I?

926
01:06:34,770 --> 01:06:40,562
You live off me, eat my food, live
in my house. You're a beggar!

927
01:06:40,804 --> 01:06:44,179
What did you say? I'm a beggar?

928
01:06:45,296 --> 01:06:48,129
Just because you're 6 ft tall
and fair, you're so stuck up.

929
01:06:48,395 --> 01:06:51,395
All this will wear out. It will rot.
It will decay.

930
01:06:52,699 --> 01:06:55,616
Who is this? This
Gautham from Canada?

931
01:06:55,812 --> 01:06:57,479
What is he to you?
- You really want to know?

932
01:06:57,479 --> 01:06:59,562
Why should he let you live
here for free for six months?

933
01:06:59,604 --> 01:07:02,187
I slept with him? Okay?

934
01:07:02,270 --> 01:07:03,979
I screwed him. - How was he?

935
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:05,565
How was he?

936
01:07:05,645 --> 01:07:07,645
Much, much, much
better than you.

937
01:07:08,501 --> 01:07:10,770
You are a bitch. Your
mother was right about you.

938
01:07:10,895 --> 01:07:13,145
Now I get it. You were
sleeping with your boss.

939
01:07:13,293 --> 01:07:16,252
That's why your husband left you.
- Stop it! Shut up!

940
01:07:16,729 --> 01:07:19,562
And now I know why
that girl left you.

941
01:07:20,062 --> 01:07:22,062
No woman can live with you.

942
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:24,979
You're worse than any thief.
You're worse than any murderer.

943
01:07:25,261 --> 01:07:26,768
You're a rapist.

944
01:07:26,793 --> 01:07:28,793
Who are you calling a rapist?

945
01:07:31,048 --> 01:07:32,006
Mom?

946
01:07:41,026 --> 01:07:42,026
It's okay.

947
01:07:42,604 --> 01:07:44,604
It's okay. Don't look at him.

948
01:07:44,812 --> 01:07:45,895
Don't look at him.

949
01:07:52,210 --> 01:07:53,418
"Who am I?"

950
01:07:54,149 --> 01:07:55,562
She says I'm the rapist?

951
01:08:01,270 --> 01:08:02,187
Come out.

952
01:08:02,489 --> 01:08:04,169
Come out now.
- What do you want?

953
01:08:04,194 --> 01:08:05,520
Come out. Answer me.

954
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:07,520
Come on, come on.
- Adrian, stay there.

955
01:08:08,498 --> 01:08:11,120
What now? Want me to
answer your questions?

956
01:08:11,145 --> 01:08:13,229
You want answers? - Yes, I do.

957
01:08:13,386 --> 01:08:14,539
Go. - Where?

958
01:08:14,564 --> 01:08:15,814
First, get out.

959
01:08:15,854 --> 01:08:18,479
First answer me.
- Go out. I will answer.

960
01:08:18,895 --> 01:08:19,729
Get out.

961
01:08:19,979 --> 01:08:21,604
Get out!

962
01:08:21,687 --> 01:08:23,437
What?
- You want answers? Go out.

963
01:08:23,479 --> 01:08:25,979
Answer me!
- Get out, you mongrel.

964
01:08:26,194 --> 01:08:28,582
I'm a mongrel?

965
01:08:28,895 --> 01:08:32,645
Now you've showed me that a
mongrel shouldn't be pampered.

966
01:08:33,093 --> 01:08:35,093
Get out. Get out, you mongrel!

967
01:08:35,426 --> 01:08:37,426
I'm a dog! - Get out!

968
01:08:40,585 --> 01:08:42,585
Althea, open the door.

969
01:08:44,085 --> 01:08:45,377
Open the door, Althea.

970
01:08:46,884 --> 01:08:48,550
Althea, listen to me.

971
01:08:50,116 --> 01:08:51,033
Althea!

972
01:08:55,241 --> 01:09:01,949
The cries heard from skyscrapers, the
ocean, the singing migratory birds...

973
01:09:02,062 --> 01:09:05,229
the lakes, the pigeons, the
farmers and the fisherfolk...

974
01:09:05,658 --> 01:09:07,333
the buildings that have
sprung up on these lakes...

975
01:09:07,358 --> 01:09:10,483
the immigrant workers from Bihar
and Orissa who built them..

976
01:09:10,890 --> 01:09:13,723
the IT and BPO workers who
speak in global languages...

977
01:09:13,748 --> 01:09:15,253
the real estate men...

978
01:09:15,278 --> 01:09:18,570
and the hotels and shops that came along
to feed and clothe these people...

979
01:09:18,994 --> 01:09:24,285
and so the sun sets in Taramani, the
home to all of these creatures.

980
01:09:32,005 --> 01:09:34,172
Two dosas, please.

981
01:09:41,713 --> 01:09:44,380
What?
- When will Beardwala come?

982
01:09:45,468 --> 01:09:47,051
He will come soon. Okay?

983
01:10:26,130 --> 01:10:30,713
You, you, you.

984
01:10:31,338 --> 01:10:33,588
My love for you,
is vast as the oceans.

985
01:10:35,130 --> 01:10:38,005
My hatred for you,
is stronger than mountains.

986
01:11:57,275 --> 01:11:57,984
Hello.

987
01:11:59,041 --> 01:11:59,958
Who is this?

988
01:12:42,598 --> 01:12:46,931
Are you the tiger, disguised as cattle?
Or am I?

989
01:13:03,355 --> 01:13:04,022
Hello.

990
01:13:04,203 --> 01:13:05,661
Hello, who is this?

991
01:13:11,031 --> 01:13:11,739
Why?

992
01:13:11,914 --> 01:13:12,789
Where should I come?

993
01:13:13,443 --> 01:13:14,255
I will try.

994
01:13:40,859 --> 01:13:41,609
Come in.

995
01:13:43,284 --> 01:13:45,289
I didn't think you would come.

996
01:13:45,369 --> 01:13:46,453
I just generally called.

997
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:48,645
Thanks for coming.

998
01:13:56,747 --> 01:13:58,580
Where is your husband?

999
01:13:59,026 --> 01:14:00,797
He’s out on some visa work.

1000
01:14:01,028 --> 01:14:02,736
He’ll be back in 30 minutes.

1001
01:14:03,005 --> 01:14:05,922
Oh! So I must leave
in 30 minutes, right?

1002
01:14:12,791 --> 01:14:13,583
What’s this?

1003
01:14:14,552 --> 01:14:15,802
Chocolates.

1004
01:14:20,874 --> 01:14:23,088
I think about what I've done
every single day.

1005
01:14:23,611 --> 01:14:25,403
I regret it everyday.

1006
01:14:26,088 --> 01:14:27,088
Yeah, I can see that.

1007
01:14:28,119 --> 01:14:29,453
It’s written all over your face.

1008
01:14:34,676 --> 01:14:37,426
I know there's no way
I can undo my mistake.

1009
01:14:38,710 --> 01:14:40,751
I know that no words
can set it right.

1010
01:14:41,547 --> 01:14:43,713
If you want to, you can.

1011
01:14:44,585 --> 01:14:46,626
If you want to set it right,
you can set it right.

1012
01:14:48,813 --> 01:14:49,938
What I should do?

1013
01:14:49,963 --> 01:14:50,922
Sleep with me.

1014
01:14:51,582 --> 01:14:52,332
What?

1015
01:14:52,664 --> 01:14:55,789
Oh, you forgot Tamil
after going abroad?

1016
01:14:56,575 --> 01:14:57,783
Sleep with me.

1017
01:14:59,422 --> 01:15:01,088
Ankit, I want to know something.

1018
01:15:02,463 --> 01:15:05,588
Do you send such messages only to me
or to other women too?

1019
01:15:08,470 --> 01:15:13,172
Althea, I am not a womanizer.

1020
01:15:13,688 --> 01:15:14,963
Then why did you text me?

1021
01:15:15,130 --> 01:15:17,588
Because, you're pretty and...

1022
01:15:17,922 --> 01:15:19,130
...you’re sexy.

1023
01:15:19,479 --> 01:15:21,604
Oh, am I the only pretty woman
in the office?

1024
01:15:22,761 --> 01:15:24,834
According to me, in the entire world,

1025
01:15:24,859 --> 01:15:26,650
there isn’t even a single woman
who isn't beautiful.

1026
01:15:27,130 --> 01:15:28,172
Then, why me?

1027
01:15:28,422 --> 01:15:29,213
Why?

1028
01:15:30,442 --> 01:15:31,859
You’re single.

1029
01:15:31,992 --> 01:15:33,117
Stylish.

1030
01:15:33,481 --> 01:15:34,689
You wear skirts.

1031
01:15:35,463 --> 01:15:36,547
You smoke.

1032
01:15:37,268 --> 01:15:39,477
So I gave it a shot.

1033
01:15:39,963 --> 01:15:41,505
If you don’t like it,
you can refuse.

1034
01:15:41,734 --> 01:15:42,984
There’s nothing wrong.

1035
01:15:43,797 --> 01:15:46,005
The only mistake I made was...

1036
01:15:46,505 --> 01:15:48,713
I didn't know you had a boyfriend.

1037
01:15:49,088 --> 01:15:49,797
Oh.

1038
01:15:51,486 --> 01:15:52,922
That’s the only mistake you made?

1039
01:15:55,588 --> 01:15:57,130
I’m not evil.

1040
01:15:57,297 --> 01:15:58,963
Even if I’m a bad man,
remember...

1041
01:15:59,141 --> 01:16:00,349
I’m your boss.

1042
01:16:00,422 --> 01:16:02,630
If I wanted to,
I could have fired you then.

1043
01:16:02,713 --> 01:16:04,880
We work in the same office.

1044
01:16:04,922 --> 01:16:07,047
And it was odd that
we weren't talking.

1045
01:16:07,570 --> 01:16:09,153
That’s why I called you.

1046
01:16:09,255 --> 01:16:11,797
To ease the tension.

1047
01:16:12,130 --> 01:16:15,088
And, I’m just a harmless flirt.

1048
01:16:23,423 --> 01:16:25,340
Can I take a picture with you?

1049
01:16:27,468 --> 01:16:29,093
Why are you so quiet?

1050
01:16:33,624 --> 01:16:36,624
Take off that shrug.

1051
01:16:49,742 --> 01:16:50,700
Smile.

1052
01:17:00,231 --> 01:17:01,898
One more?
- Of course.

1053
01:17:03,570 --> 01:17:04,445
Look here.

1054
01:17:05,309 --> 01:17:06,142
Look.

1055
01:17:07,306 --> 01:17:08,890
I’m talking to you, look here.

1056
01:17:10,348 --> 01:17:11,431
Look.

1057
01:17:12,078 --> 01:17:14,453
Hello. I'm talking to you.

1058
01:17:22,297 --> 01:17:24,713
You're not worth sleeping with.

1059
01:17:30,922 --> 01:17:31,713
Ankit.

1060
01:17:32,005 --> 01:17:34,005
I don’t know if you are
a good man or not.

1061
01:17:34,153 --> 01:17:35,695
But I am a bad woman.

1062
01:17:36,130 --> 01:17:36,797
What?

1063
01:17:37,539 --> 01:17:38,705
You’ll know tomorrow.

1064
01:17:41,861 --> 01:17:43,820
What?
Your sacred wedding chain is here.

1065
01:17:44,005 --> 01:17:45,630
Forgot to wear it after showering?

1066
01:17:46,153 --> 01:17:47,880
Probably 10 sovereigns, right?

1067
01:17:48,461 --> 01:17:49,752
Must be expensive.

1068
01:17:50,184 --> 01:17:51,184
Sowmya...

1069
01:17:52,038 --> 01:17:53,329
I have 3 photos of us.

1070
01:17:53,514 --> 01:17:55,544
We have 15 minutes
till your husband returns.

1071
01:17:55,757 --> 01:17:56,798
300 thousand rupees.

1072
01:17:57,047 --> 01:17:58,130
If you don't pay me back...

1073
01:17:58,260 --> 01:18:00,760
I’ll wait here till your man shows up.

1074
01:18:02,591 --> 01:18:03,716
Wait in the living room.

1075
01:18:29,286 --> 01:18:31,078
I asked for money, what’s this?

1076
01:18:31,884 --> 01:18:33,176
Open it and see.

1077
01:18:41,380 --> 01:18:44,380
I thought you wouldn’t
accept my money.

1078
01:18:44,797 --> 01:18:46,172
So I gave it in a box of chocolates.

1079
01:18:48,137 --> 01:18:50,470
If I'd come back from the US...

1080
01:18:50,963 --> 01:18:53,422
everyone who loaned money to my dad...

1081
01:18:55,505 --> 01:18:58,130
would have done to me everyday
what you just did.

1082
01:19:02,447 --> 01:19:03,989
There's 500 thousand here...

1083
01:19:04,235 --> 01:19:05,797
I didn't ask for an interest.

1084
01:19:08,341 --> 01:19:10,549
Keep the extra 200 thousand rupees.

1085
01:19:20,759 --> 01:19:22,272
I’ll delete the photos.

1086
01:19:22,382 --> 01:19:23,382
It’s okay.

1087
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:29,005
Even if I hadn't paid you,
you woudn't have done anything.

1088
01:19:30,625 --> 01:19:31,875
Because...

1089
01:19:32,547 --> 01:19:35,713
you’re the only good man
I have ever met in my life.

1090
01:19:51,161 --> 01:19:52,980
Why do you keep scolding that poor girl?

1091
01:19:53,005 --> 01:19:54,963
Dumbo, are you paying attention to me?

1092
01:19:56,379 --> 01:19:58,212
Barnabas' words are like the Bible.

1093
01:20:00,022 --> 01:20:00,563
Superb, sir.

1094
01:20:00,588 --> 01:20:03,297
Yeah, yeah.
Barnabas' words are like the Bible.

1095
01:20:03,436 --> 01:20:04,588
She’s good and I'm evil.

1096
01:20:04,655 --> 01:20:06,505
Superb, sir.

1097
01:20:06,771 --> 01:20:09,207
Oh, Venus sent
a note even today?

1098
01:20:09,260 --> 01:20:10,302
Yes, as usual.

1099
01:20:10,897 --> 01:20:12,897
Take the white tablet before food.

1100
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:14,083
Here it is.

1101
01:20:14,942 --> 01:20:17,147
Do not drink water while eating.

1102
01:20:17,210 --> 01:20:18,043
I won’t.

1103
01:20:19,253 --> 01:20:21,792
Take the yellow tablet after food.

1104
01:20:21,963 --> 01:20:22,922
Yellow, yellow.

1105
01:20:24,112 --> 01:20:24,797
Next, Rosie.

1106
01:20:24,797 --> 01:20:28,797
Feed biscuits to Rosie
and keep her close for safety.

1107
01:20:29,133 --> 01:20:30,799
Signed, Venus.
With a cross at the bottom.

1108
01:20:31,188 --> 01:20:35,338
Sir, Sowmya looks like a good person to you
because you have a wife like Venus.

1109
01:20:35,463 --> 01:20:37,213
Here, can you feel my pulse?

1110
01:20:38,094 --> 01:20:39,005
Am I breathing?

1111
01:20:39,005 --> 01:20:40,338
I've been alive
these past two years?

1112
01:20:40,380 --> 01:20:42,963
Don’t I have a phone? Facebook?
Mail ID? WhatsApp?

1113
01:20:43,196 --> 01:20:47,713
She could’ve told me this before!
She could have told me I’m a good person.

1114
01:20:47,899 --> 01:20:48,963
She could have!

1115
01:20:48,963 --> 01:20:54,130
Why did I have to grow a beard
and live like a beggar all this time?

1116
01:20:54,369 --> 01:20:56,338
She’s handing me a chocolate box!

1117
01:20:56,626 --> 01:20:58,297
Sitting there with
her hair stylish and loose.

1118
01:20:58,728 --> 01:20:59,588
I threatened her.

1119
01:20:59,892 --> 01:21:02,172
She claimed she did
what anyone would have done.

1120
01:21:02,512 --> 01:21:04,922
Althea called me a rapist!

1121
01:21:05,145 --> 01:21:08,505
Tell me, am I a rapist?
Tell me, sir. Am I?

1122
01:21:09,176 --> 01:21:13,213
"Beat her out! Kick her out!
Don't need her at all."

1123
01:21:13,643 --> 01:21:15,005
Director Selvaraghavan was right.

1124
01:21:15,005 --> 01:21:17,380
I should’ve slapped her!

1125
01:21:17,752 --> 01:21:22,422
But I pretended to be
a good man and left.

1126
01:21:22,968 --> 01:21:27,176
"Beat her out! Kick her out!
Don't need her at all."

1127
01:21:45,234 --> 01:21:46,442
Sir…

1128
01:21:46,999 --> 01:21:48,499
Sir…

1129
01:21:49,380 --> 01:21:50,496
Don't you touch me.

1130
01:21:50,521 --> 01:21:51,979
Sorry, sir.

1131
01:21:52,238 --> 01:21:55,422
I shouldn’t have
used you like a pickle to my booze.

1132
01:21:55,672 --> 01:21:58,297
I came here to give you
the 300 thousand rupees.

1133
01:21:58,540 --> 01:21:59,797
Why are you giving this to me?

1134
01:21:59,797 --> 01:22:01,963
Sir, I wanted to give it
to Rahim Bhai’s family...

1135
01:22:02,657 --> 01:22:03,797
but they have left the city.

1136
01:22:03,898 --> 01:22:06,731
Their neighbours have promised
to get me the new address.

1137
01:22:08,790 --> 01:22:11,130
I don't know if I'll even
be able to absolve my sins.

1138
01:22:12,411 --> 01:22:14,036
Please keep it till then.

1139
01:22:15,331 --> 01:22:20,338
You don’t even know where I live.
How can you trust me? And I’m a cop, too!

1140
01:22:21,538 --> 01:22:26,871
Sir, besides my father,
you’re the only good person I’ve known.

1141
01:22:26,968 --> 01:22:27,730
Can I sit down?

1142
01:22:27,755 --> 01:22:28,838
Sit, sit, sit.

1143
01:22:30,386 --> 01:22:33,588
Sir, just one more. Please, sir.
Last one.

1144
01:22:33,697 --> 01:22:36,322
No, that's enough.
Your liver is already burned.

1145
01:22:36,922 --> 01:22:38,713
Just one more.

1146
01:22:39,861 --> 01:22:42,528
Sir, am I really a rapist?

1147
01:22:43,720 --> 01:22:45,213
Tell me, sir.
Am I really a rapist?

1148
01:22:45,330 --> 01:22:46,830
You’re not.

1149
01:22:47,005 --> 01:22:48,547
Sir, am I a bad person?

1150
01:22:49,806 --> 01:22:50,681
Tell me, sir.

1151
01:22:50,984 --> 01:22:52,775
You’re not. Let it go.

1152
01:22:53,255 --> 01:22:55,297
Am I good, sir?
-You are a good man.

1153
01:22:55,398 --> 01:22:57,731
Barnabas’ words are like the Bible.
Enough?

1154
01:23:03,088 --> 01:23:06,963
I shouldn’t have doubted Althea, sir.

1155
01:23:08,262 --> 01:23:10,054
It’s all because Sowmya betrayed me.

1156
01:23:11,142 --> 01:23:12,684
That's why I...

1157
01:23:14,538 --> 01:23:16,713
If I talk to Althea...
I know the words that can fix it.

1158
01:23:16,797 --> 01:23:18,713
Here. Talk.

1159
01:23:19,164 --> 01:23:21,705
Oh, come on, sir!

1160
01:23:21,950 --> 01:23:24,172
She'll yell at me even if
I call during the day.

1161
01:23:24,293 --> 01:23:26,297
Now it's late. And I'm drunk.

1162
01:23:26,505 --> 01:23:28,213
If I call her now
she will swear at me.

1163
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:32,313
Will things be okay if I speak to her?
- Yes. First speak to her.

1164
01:23:32,528 --> 01:23:35,070
Will it be alright sir?
- You speak to her.

1165
01:23:35,103 --> 01:23:36,478
Hey, just talk to her.

1166
01:23:38,797 --> 01:23:40,880
He said he'd talk it out
but he's passed out!

1167
01:23:45,145 --> 01:23:47,687
Hey, Ankit.
Why are you so worked up?

1168
01:23:48,115 --> 01:23:49,547
We could talk in your cabin, right?

1169
01:23:50,099 --> 01:23:51,505
Don’t joke, Althea.

1170
01:23:51,547 --> 01:23:52,963
I’m not joking.

1171
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:57,876
Please delete the photos
you uploaded on Facebook.

1172
01:23:58,598 --> 01:24:01,181
That is my Facebook account.
I uploaded the photos.

1173
01:24:01,338 --> 01:24:02,630
What’s it to you?

1174
01:24:02,926 --> 01:24:05,605
My wife…
she is not like you.

1175
01:24:05,761 --> 01:24:06,759
She’s traditional.

1176
01:24:06,790 --> 01:24:09,082
The kind who wears saris.

1177
01:24:09,354 --> 01:24:11,938
My daughter is a 14 year old teenager.

1178
01:24:12,083 --> 01:24:13,338
If they see the photos...

1179
01:24:13,510 --> 01:24:14,718
I’m sorry, Ankit.

1180
01:24:14,943 --> 01:24:17,422
That is your shit.
You have to clean it.

1181
01:24:18,359 --> 01:24:19,900
Be a Gandhian.

1182
01:24:20,740 --> 01:24:22,922
I never expected you
to be this kind of woman.

1183
01:24:23,092 --> 01:24:24,772
What kind did you think I was?

1184
01:24:24,906 --> 01:24:26,531
No…
- No what?

1185
01:24:26,621 --> 01:24:27,996
Listen…
- Listen what?

1186
01:24:29,362 --> 01:24:33,088
Oh, yeah. I’m an Anglo-Indian.
Modern.

1187
01:24:33,463 --> 01:24:34,463
Open minded.

1188
01:24:34,713 --> 01:24:37,380
So if you ask me out,
I should sleep with you?

1189
01:24:37,426 --> 01:24:39,630
If you apologise,
I should smile and walk away?

1190
01:24:39,754 --> 01:24:41,418
But I shouldn’t do all this?
Is this what you mean?

1191
01:24:41,443 --> 01:24:42,777
I’ll fall at your feet.

1192
01:24:44,527 --> 01:24:47,172
Money? Money?
How much money do you need?

1193
01:24:47,463 --> 01:24:48,688
Please delete it.

1194
01:24:48,713 --> 01:24:50,629
Will you people never learn?

1195
01:24:51,055 --> 01:24:54,263
Please, tell me what I should do.
I’ll do it. Please.

1196
01:24:54,359 --> 01:24:56,984
I can’t work here, seeing your face.

1197
01:24:57,338 --> 01:25:00,797
And I can't quit this job,
because I have no choice.

1198
01:25:01,734 --> 01:25:03,775
It would be better if you quit.

1199
01:25:03,984 --> 01:25:06,422
I will leave.
But you delete it. Please.

1200
01:25:06,710 --> 01:25:07,588
When are you leaving?

1201
01:25:07,713 --> 01:25:08,797
Soon.

1202
01:25:09,005 --> 01:25:10,422
How soon?

1203
01:25:10,902 --> 01:25:14,463
I will leave in a month.
Please delete it. I promise.

1204
01:25:14,707 --> 01:25:19,422
I swear on my wife.
Please delete it. I swear on my daughter.

1205
01:25:20,004 --> 01:25:22,213
Please delete it.
- Relax..

1206
01:25:24,671 --> 01:25:25,754
Deleted.

1207
01:25:26,079 --> 01:25:27,288
Thanks a lot, Ankit.

1208
01:25:35,375 --> 01:25:36,375
Althea?

1209
01:25:37,305 --> 01:25:39,596
Don’t mistake me for asking this.

1210
01:25:39,813 --> 01:25:40,563
What?

1211
01:25:40,588 --> 01:25:42,338
Has he left?

1212
01:25:45,710 --> 01:25:47,626
Good riddance. Be happy.

1213
01:25:50,422 --> 01:25:53,047
I dumped my frustration
from seven years on him.

1214
01:25:54,728 --> 01:25:57,770
Maybe if I had explained it to him
a little patiently...

1215
01:25:58,583 --> 01:25:59,750
he might have understood.

1216
01:26:01,772 --> 01:26:03,688
He loved me in his own way, you know?

1217
01:26:03,759 --> 01:26:05,343
You’ll never change.

1218
01:26:06,513 --> 01:26:08,430
Now you sound like my mother.

1219
01:26:15,047 --> 01:26:15,880
Is it him?

1220
01:26:32,005 --> 01:26:33,005
Hello, Prabhu.

1221
01:26:35,116 --> 01:26:37,324
Can you hear me?
- I can hear you just fine, woman!

1222
01:26:38,297 --> 01:26:40,880
You spoke like you were some
epitome of chastity?

1223
01:26:41,047 --> 01:26:42,922
Look what's happened.
Just like I said.

1224
01:26:43,255 --> 01:26:46,297
You slept with him.
You took photos hugging him!

1225
01:26:46,505 --> 01:26:47,838
Did you enjoy?

1226
01:26:48,087 --> 01:26:49,213
Did he do you well?

1227
01:26:49,230 --> 01:26:50,063
Tell me!

1228
01:26:50,088 --> 01:26:51,213
Open your mouth!

1229
01:26:51,255 --> 01:26:52,588
Tell me, you bloody bitch!

1230
01:26:53,672 --> 01:26:55,838
You think I can’t see your photos
if you block me on Facebook?

1231
01:26:56,047 --> 01:26:57,755
You think you’re that smart?
Smart ass.

1232
01:26:58,047 --> 01:27:02,463
Do you know how your 2248 friends
became 2278?

1233
01:27:02,713 --> 01:27:05,463
The extra thirty are my fake profiles.
Find and block them if you can.

1234
01:27:05,505 --> 01:27:08,866
When you accept random
friends just so they

1235
01:27:09,334 --> 01:27:11,946
can call you hot or
sexy or gorgeous...

1236
01:27:12,092 --> 01:27:13,755
this is what happens.
Do you understand?

1237
01:27:16,356 --> 01:27:19,213
I feel ashamed to have lived
under a roof with you for 10 months.

1238
01:27:19,382 --> 01:27:20,298
I’m disgusted.

1239
01:27:20,617 --> 01:27:22,117
What kind of woman are you?

1240
01:27:22,172 --> 01:27:24,130
Shit! Hang up.

1241
01:27:35,502 --> 01:27:41,502
Sexual predator seduces and cheats
married women by calling their phone.

1242
01:27:42,127 --> 01:27:45,198
A 30 year old resident
of Coimbatore has

1243
01:27:45,223 --> 01:27:48,442
stolen women's phone
numbers from a store.

1244
01:27:48,775 --> 01:28:00,566
He lured women with dirty texts to a
public place and robbed their jewels.

1245
01:28:02,265 --> 01:28:04,432
Is this even possible?

1246
01:28:04,752 --> 01:28:06,377
Looks fake.

1247
01:28:07,002 --> 01:28:08,418
It happens, sir.

1248
01:28:09,038 --> 01:28:09,913
Really?

1249
01:28:10,043 --> 01:28:13,085
Even worse things happen.
- It happens, it really happens.

1250
01:28:13,292 --> 01:28:14,768
How do you know?

1251
01:28:14,871 --> 01:28:16,371
Should I prove it to you?

1252
01:28:17,310 --> 01:28:19,685
Why the hell should
you prove it to me?

1253
01:28:19,769 --> 01:28:24,227
Exactly. Why should I prove it to you?
I should prove it to myself.

1254
01:28:24,314 --> 01:28:26,855
What? Prove to yourself?

1255
01:28:29,473 --> 01:28:35,807
No... I need to know if these women
play only me or other men too.

1256
01:28:35,835 --> 01:28:36,835
And by knowing it?

1257
01:28:37,483 --> 01:28:40,538
Knowing that other
people also eat the same

1258
01:28:40,897 --> 01:28:43,340
shit, I'll eat it a
little more gladly.

1259
01:28:43,631 --> 01:28:47,210
Shit...? - You don't know
what it means? Poop, sir.

1260
01:28:47,332 --> 01:28:48,957
Bro! - Tell me, sir.

1261
01:28:49,151 --> 01:28:52,277
You’re the first civilised city person
to know the old Tamil word for 'shit'.

1262
01:28:52,333 --> 01:28:56,416
You've been played a lot?
- Oh, quite a lot.

1263
01:28:57,152 --> 01:29:01,611
Go, on. Drink that tea. And
automatically shit will come.

1264
01:29:04,088 --> 01:29:05,713
Sir, just a minute.

1265
01:29:05,894 --> 01:29:08,627
I have my ex-girlfriend’s number.
Please note it down.

1266
01:29:08,685 --> 01:29:11,143
And torture her to your level best.
Don’t spare her, sir.

1267
01:29:11,168 --> 01:29:12,210
Keep torturing her.
Here's her number.

1268
01:29:12,252 --> 01:29:14,127
Bro... - Tell me.

1269
01:29:14,152 --> 01:29:15,627
Can you give me the number?

1270
01:29:15,674 --> 01:29:19,882
Yeah. Note it down. Please beware.
Her husband is a jerk.

1271
01:29:21,705 --> 01:29:26,080
These days, the way a guy celebrates
his heartbreak has changed.

1272
01:29:26,722 --> 01:29:30,049
Some peculiar guys flirt
with unknown women...

1273
01:29:30,074 --> 01:29:32,283
and torture whichever girl
gets stuck with them.

1274
01:29:32,480 --> 01:29:35,090
P.S : Apologies for not
knowing the exact translation

1275
01:29:35,170 --> 01:29:37,392
for the words 'flirt'
and 'torture' in Tamil.

1276
01:29:37,920 --> 01:29:40,244
Therefore, our sincere
apologies for the scant

1277
01:29:40,277 --> 01:29:42,452
usage of Tamil words
in the following song.

1278
01:30:32,921 --> 01:30:35,088
Who are you talking to today?
- Just a minute, sir.

1279
01:30:35,310 --> 01:30:38,139
How did you land so many girls?
- Please leave, sir.

1280
01:30:38,167 --> 01:30:40,126
Someday, their men
will come after you.

1281
01:30:45,038 --> 01:30:45,955
Drink your tea.

1282
01:30:46,043 --> 01:30:48,543
You should come out
of this shit, Althea.

1283
01:30:51,226 --> 01:30:53,685
This Friday night is
Salsa night at the pub.

1284
01:30:53,741 --> 01:30:55,491
I’m going with my husband.
You’re coming.

1285
01:30:56,030 --> 01:30:57,780
What will I do in the pub?

1286
01:30:58,178 --> 01:31:02,345
Is there some rule that only men
should drink because of heartbreaks?

1287
01:31:39,502 --> 01:31:40,835
The sea, the rain and me.

1288
01:31:40,894 --> 01:31:42,060
You are so romantic.

1289
01:31:42,085 --> 01:31:43,002
Then come over.

1290
01:31:43,085 --> 01:31:44,710
Okay, done. Where should I come?

1291
01:31:49,915 --> 01:31:51,123
Cheers.

1292
01:31:57,972 --> 01:31:59,764
You don’t dance Salsa?

1293
01:32:00,983 --> 01:32:02,602
I can’t dance.

1294
01:32:02,627 --> 01:32:04,335
She loves to dance.

1295
01:32:04,377 --> 01:32:08,043
I love to watch her dance.

1296
01:32:18,627 --> 01:32:20,002
Hi. - Prabunath.

1297
01:32:26,356 --> 01:32:28,518
You look wow. - Thank you.

1298
01:32:28,543 --> 01:32:29,627
Okay, shall we leave?

1299
01:32:29,627 --> 01:32:31,085
No!

1300
01:32:31,223 --> 01:32:33,739
There's a prayer early morning.
Mom has already called thrice.

1301
01:32:33,764 --> 01:32:34,806
You and your mom…

1302
01:32:35,256 --> 01:32:38,089
She'll be waiting for us.
- No, no, no. Please, please…

1303
01:32:38,154 --> 01:32:39,571
Okay. - Please.

1304
01:32:39,650 --> 01:32:43,650
I will bring the car to the entrance.
You finish your dance and come soon.

1305
01:32:43,942 --> 01:32:44,893
Thank you, baldy!

1306
01:32:44,918 --> 01:32:46,085
I love you. - So sweet.

1307
01:32:46,127 --> 01:32:47,335
See you! - Bye.

1308
01:32:50,707 --> 01:32:51,416
Bye!

1309
01:33:09,309 --> 01:33:11,518
Okay, I have to go.
He is waiting.

1310
01:33:11,629 --> 01:33:12,629
It’s already late.

1311
01:33:14,066 --> 01:33:15,191
You are very lucky.

1312
01:33:15,714 --> 01:33:17,006
You've got a good husband.

1313
01:33:17,184 --> 01:33:19,935
There are no good dogs and bad dogs.
Dogs are dogs.

1314
01:33:20,022 --> 01:33:22,022
Just throw them the
correct biscuits.

1315
01:33:28,435 --> 01:33:29,310
Hey, babe...

1316
01:33:29,335 --> 01:33:30,627
This for you...

1317
01:33:31,598 --> 01:33:33,140
Drink, drink!

1318
01:33:48,322 --> 01:33:50,780
Think you're a beauty queen or what?
I'm talking to you.

1319
01:33:50,877 --> 01:33:52,168
Let it go, buddy.

1320
01:33:53,049 --> 01:33:56,007
Hey, hey, hello.

1321
01:33:56,230 --> 01:33:57,064
What?

1322
01:33:57,728 --> 01:33:58,728
How much?

1323
01:33:59,347 --> 01:34:00,181
Huh?

1324
01:34:00,627 --> 01:34:03,127
Hey, she is an English bitch.

1325
01:34:03,362 --> 01:34:04,237
How much?

1326
01:34:04,926 --> 01:34:05,760
What?

1327
01:34:06,168 --> 01:34:08,502
Wait. -Ask her buddy.

1328
01:34:09,830 --> 01:34:12,538
25,000 rupees, one night?

1329
01:34:16,085 --> 01:34:17,918
She's started stripping. Superb.

1330
01:34:20,072 --> 01:34:23,822
Hey, what did you say?
What did you say?

1331
01:34:24,227 --> 01:34:26,310
Who the hell do you
think you are?

1332
01:34:26,413 --> 01:34:31,038
How dare you? How dare you
talk to me like that?

1333
01:34:31,830 --> 01:34:35,330
Scoundrels... You think you can
say whatever you want to a woman.

1334
01:34:35,606 --> 01:34:39,143
Are you guys creating
ruckus here?

1335
01:34:39,168 --> 01:34:41,527
Get out of this place.
Won't you guys listen?

1336
01:34:41,552 --> 01:34:43,335
I’ll bloody kill you.
- Madam, you leave please.

1337
01:34:46,418 --> 01:34:47,752
Go out immediately.

1338
01:34:47,793 --> 01:34:49,043
Get lost.

1339
01:34:49,518 --> 01:34:52,185
Wedding ring. Platinum.
150 thousand rupees.

1340
01:34:52,288 --> 01:34:55,913
Such a small ring costs so much?
- Of course, it is.

1341
01:34:56,257 --> 01:34:58,132
Can I give you some advice?
- What?

1342
01:34:58,478 --> 01:35:00,728
Don’t answer a call
from a stranger.

1343
01:35:01,010 --> 01:35:03,135
Even if you do,
don’t talk to him.

1344
01:35:03,269 --> 01:35:05,310
Even if you talk,
don’t flirt with him.

1345
01:35:05,411 --> 01:35:08,393
Even if you flirt, don’t
come to the beach like this.

1346
01:35:08,480 --> 01:35:10,939
Even if you come to the beach,
don’t come on a rainy night.

1347
01:35:11,345 --> 01:35:14,845
Even if you come on a rainy night,
don’t give him your ring when he asks.

1348
01:35:15,205 --> 01:35:16,163
What?

1349
01:35:16,897 --> 01:35:21,772
I know people don’t like free advice. So
I'm taking this ring as payment for it.

1350
01:35:21,916 --> 01:35:22,874
Are you joking, Prabhu..?

1351
01:35:23,018 --> 01:35:24,768
No, ma'am. I'm not
at all joking.

1352
01:35:24,840 --> 01:35:27,132
One second. Wait.

1353
01:35:28,231 --> 01:35:29,393
You see this phone?

1354
01:35:29,543 --> 01:35:32,543
I got it from Kavitha two days
ago for the advice I gave her.

1355
01:35:34,089 --> 01:35:38,881
Wait, relax. Cool.
- I'll go to the police.

1356
01:35:39,178 --> 01:35:40,470
To the police? - Yes.

1357
01:35:40,620 --> 01:35:43,995
All our conversations are
recorded in this. - No, Prabhu...

1358
01:35:44,920 --> 01:35:46,712
Do you know WhatsApp? - Yes.

1359
01:35:47,527 --> 01:35:49,652
I can send them
anywhere and to anyone.

1360
01:35:50,050 --> 01:35:52,675
Now, I will walk this way. You
shouldn't scream. - No, Prabhu.

1361
01:35:52,787 --> 01:35:55,704
Even if you do, there is nobody
around to listen to your screams.

1362
01:35:55,798 --> 01:35:57,131
Okay? Can I go?

1363
01:35:57,214 --> 01:36:00,798
Bye. Bye, Mamta and
don’t forget my advice.

1364
01:36:02,630 --> 01:36:05,199
Dear public, it is a criminal
offence to upload/share

1365
01:36:05,224 --> 01:36:07,339
the photos and voice
notes of any individual

1366
01:36:07,364 --> 01:36:09,518
on social networking sites
including WhatsApp without

1367
01:36:09,543 --> 01:36:11,352
explicit consent of the
individual concerned.

1368
01:36:11,377 --> 01:36:15,020
The offence is liable for
sentence of 3 to 5 years

1369
01:36:15,045 --> 01:36:18,901
under IT Act and Prevention
of Sexual Harassment Act.

1370
01:36:19,502 --> 01:36:22,085
Suppose you’re asking how can you
announce this during a film?

1371
01:36:22,127 --> 01:36:24,427
The Indian censor board
tells us to caution against

1372
01:36:24,452 --> 01:36:26,418
drinking and smoking in
the middle of films.

1373
01:36:26,460 --> 01:36:28,127
This, too, can be said.

1374
01:36:33,472 --> 01:36:35,431
Hello. What's up at this hour?

1375
01:36:35,665 --> 01:36:38,456
Hello, Mr. Assistant Commissioner.
Are you busy?

1376
01:36:38,645 --> 01:36:43,122
No, my wife was sleeping next to me.
Phone was on silent.

1377
01:36:43,252 --> 01:36:46,252
Sorry have I wrongly called
you at the right time?

1378
01:36:46,491 --> 01:36:47,491
Tell me, what’s up?

1379
01:36:48,416 --> 01:36:50,957
I went to Kanathur
beach with a guy…

1380
01:36:51,290 --> 01:36:52,331
Which guy?

1381
01:36:52,583 --> 01:36:55,918
No idea. We spoke over the phone.
I liked him.

1382
01:36:56,186 --> 01:36:59,478
Oh! You go places
with unknown men?

1383
01:36:59,911 --> 01:37:01,518
But when I call you,
you wouldn't come.

1384
01:37:01,598 --> 01:37:03,293
Nothing like that.

1385
01:37:03,293 --> 01:37:06,085
Okay, you went to the beach.

1386
01:37:06,601 --> 01:37:07,435
Then?

1387
01:37:07,519 --> 01:37:09,227
He snatched my ring!

1388
01:37:09,393 --> 01:37:10,518
It’s just a ring right?

1389
01:37:10,543 --> 01:37:11,918
No… It’s my wedding ring.

1390
01:37:12,043 --> 01:37:14,460
Hubby will be back in 15 days.

1391
01:37:15,335 --> 01:37:18,627
If my ring is missing, it’ll
become a big problem.

1392
01:37:19,043 --> 01:37:21,043
He’s recorded all my calls, too.

1393
01:37:21,085 --> 01:37:22,710
So please help me.

1394
01:37:23,127 --> 01:37:24,835
Now you're all sweet.

1395
01:37:25,252 --> 01:37:27,210
But if I ask you out for a
coffee, do you ever come?

1396
01:37:27,627 --> 01:37:30,543
Please do me this favor! Whatever
you tell me to drink, I’ll drink!

1397
01:37:30,585 --> 01:37:31,460
Really?

1398
01:37:31,963 --> 01:37:32,768
Promise!

1399
01:37:32,793 --> 01:37:35,585
Okay. Let me note
the number down.

1400
01:37:35,689 --> 01:37:37,314
Wait for a minute. - Okay.

1401
01:37:40,566 --> 01:37:41,941
Give me the number.

1402
01:37:42,304 --> 01:37:46,679
7-6-3-9.. -7-6-3-9..

1403
01:37:46,761 --> 01:37:48,970
2-3-8.. -2-3-8..

1404
01:37:48,995 --> 01:37:51,287
2-2-5. -2-2-5.

1405
01:37:51,759 --> 01:37:53,717
Okay. I will call
you in morning.

1406
01:37:57,960 --> 01:38:00,543
See, Althea... you have become
the talk of this company.

1407
01:38:00,726 --> 01:38:02,268
In fact, the talk of this town.

1408
01:38:02,293 --> 01:38:03,043
What?

1409
01:38:04,377 --> 01:38:07,627
The recent incident of
you drinking at the pub!

1410
01:38:07,876 --> 01:38:09,084
Don’t you people drink?

1411
01:38:09,710 --> 01:38:13,710
See, it’s not a crime to drink.
But to beat up a guy after that…

1412
01:38:13,735 --> 01:38:15,697
They spoke to me indecently.
They behaved badly.

1413
01:38:15,763 --> 01:38:16,638
So I beat them up.

1414
01:38:17,040 --> 01:38:18,831
See, as men we have
some privileges.

1415
01:38:19,392 --> 01:38:22,892
If we make a mess after drinking,
it won’t appear in newspapers.

1416
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:26,738
But you’re a female… and
our company’s image…

1417
01:38:26,811 --> 01:38:30,019
The paper hasn’t printed my name. How
would it print the company’s name?

1418
01:38:30,428 --> 01:38:33,136
I think you haven’t checked
Facebook since last night.

1419
01:38:39,960 --> 01:38:42,043
This has been going
viral since yesterday.

1420
01:38:42,127 --> 01:38:45,168
Many people have mentioned your name.
And the company’s name, too.

1421
01:38:53,002 --> 01:38:54,002
So what?

1422
01:38:54,870 --> 01:38:57,745
In fact, I was talking to the
head office before you came in.

1423
01:38:57,928 --> 01:38:59,595
They want you to quit.

1424
01:39:04,418 --> 01:39:05,877
In how many days should I quit?

1425
01:39:06,710 --> 01:39:11,043
You can take 30 minutes
to send your resignation.

1426
01:39:14,810 --> 01:39:16,602
Okay. Thanks.

1427
01:39:16,736 --> 01:39:20,361
But don’t worry! I
am there for you.

1428
01:39:21,100 --> 01:39:24,267
You can call me for
anything, at any time.

1429
01:39:28,127 --> 01:39:31,918
Only thing is, you have
to be a little flexible.

1430
01:39:34,210 --> 01:39:36,210
I hope you understand.

1431
01:39:42,181 --> 01:39:49,056
Corporate companies do not ensure
job security, or women’s safety.

1432
01:39:49,402 --> 01:39:53,152
To form a union or demand
any right is not permitted.

1433
01:39:53,377 --> 01:39:56,585
Anybody can be thrown out
of their job at anytime.

1434
01:39:56,918 --> 01:40:01,085
The employees are similar to Chennai
battling during heavy rains.

1435
01:40:04,793 --> 01:40:08,627
It’s only been 4 days! Think it’s
easy to tap a phone unofficially?

1436
01:40:08,893 --> 01:40:10,018
We found out... - Sir?

1437
01:40:10,043 --> 01:40:14,127
that he’s on his way to Perungudi
to meet a woman like you.

1438
01:40:14,152 --> 01:40:18,277
I'm here now. Within 2 hours,
I’ll catch him by the neck...

1439
01:40:19,210 --> 01:40:24,460
get your ring and phone,
and then come see you.

1440
01:40:24,681 --> 01:40:26,185
What now? - The phone.

1441
01:40:26,210 --> 01:40:27,168
Tell me.

1442
01:40:27,335 --> 01:40:29,127
Be careful while speaking
over the phone, sir.

1443
01:40:29,152 --> 01:40:30,902
These days everything
is leaked on WhatsApp.

1444
01:40:31,322 --> 01:40:34,103
Especially if a cop is on
the phone with a woman.

1445
01:40:34,128 --> 01:40:36,628
Sir, our team is in conference call..
-Wait.

1446
01:40:37,084 --> 01:40:40,834
Okay, I’ll call you. No, no, no.
I won’t.

1447
01:40:41,168 --> 01:40:43,085
No, no, no. You don’t
call me either.

1448
01:40:43,502 --> 01:40:45,002
Please don’t call me.

1449
01:40:45,335 --> 01:40:48,710
I’ll come and see you with the
ring in two hours. Hang up.

1450
01:40:50,127 --> 01:40:51,168
Now tell me.

1451
01:40:51,168 --> 01:40:54,835
Sir, I told everyone that it’s not
official and it's your personal issue.

1452
01:40:55,377 --> 01:40:57,418
Kumaresan is in the tea shop.
- Then?

1453
01:40:57,768 --> 01:40:59,439
Thangaraj is in the auto.

1454
01:40:59,464 --> 01:41:00,923
Grandpa is downstairs. -Okay.

1455
01:41:01,043 --> 01:41:02,252
Pushparaj is on the roof.

1456
01:41:02,416 --> 01:41:05,332
Everyone knows what to do?
- Yes, sir.

1457
01:41:11,877 --> 01:41:12,710
Hello.

1458
01:41:12,710 --> 01:41:14,043
Reached? - Yes.

1459
01:41:14,043 --> 01:41:15,710
Where are you?
- In the tea shop.

1460
01:41:15,710 --> 01:41:16,627
Turn around.

1461
01:41:17,460 --> 01:41:21,085
Can you see me by the window?
- Yes. I can.

1462
01:41:22,569 --> 01:41:25,027
Sir, looks like the lady is
talking to someone on the phone.

1463
01:41:31,292 --> 01:41:34,126
How can we tell who it is?
Ask them to wait.

1464
01:41:34,710 --> 01:41:36,460
My husband will
leave now for duty.

1465
01:41:36,485 --> 01:41:41,193
I'll call you. You come up then.
- Okay.

1466
01:41:48,189 --> 01:41:49,064
Where is your son?

1467
01:41:50,057 --> 01:41:53,765
He has gone to tuition.
I have to go by 8.

1468
01:41:54,272 --> 01:41:57,064
How will he be faithful to God if you
don’t bring him to church often?

1469
01:41:57,334 --> 01:42:00,417
Not only God lives in the
Church, Father. Satan does too.

1470
01:42:00,627 --> 01:42:02,627
Satan? What do you mean?

1471
01:42:03,960 --> 01:42:05,252
I meant my mother.

1472
01:42:08,835 --> 01:42:11,877
Your mother is not so bad
that you must curse her so.

1473
01:42:12,543 --> 01:42:15,377
In fact, she's a much
better mother than you are.

1474
01:42:15,964 --> 01:42:17,756
Look how pious she is!

1475
01:42:19,379 --> 01:42:20,838
You don’t get it, Father.

1476
01:42:21,085 --> 01:42:22,127
Why wouldn’t I?

1477
01:42:22,252 --> 01:42:23,627
Because you are a Father.

1478
01:42:23,627 --> 01:42:24,543
Meaning?

1479
01:42:25,379 --> 01:42:26,921
Meaning you are a man.

1480
01:42:28,918 --> 01:42:30,585
Forget it, child.

1481
01:42:32,642 --> 01:42:35,850
Your mother prayed to take her
grandson to Velankanni on pilgrimage.

1482
01:42:36,233 --> 01:42:38,400
You have every right
to reject your mother.

1483
01:42:38,585 --> 01:42:41,710
But you don’t have the right to
severe her ties with her grandson.

1484
01:42:41,793 --> 01:42:43,835
Send your son.
- Let her take him.

1485
01:42:44,293 --> 01:42:47,543
You go tell her
yourself, please.

1486
01:42:53,918 --> 01:42:55,252
15 days only, right?

1487
01:42:55,293 --> 01:42:58,043
Take him. But take care of him.

1488
01:42:59,002 --> 01:43:01,085
Not like how you
took care of me.

1489
01:43:17,543 --> 01:43:19,710
Sir, the husband is coming down.

1490
01:43:20,710 --> 01:43:23,043
Ask everyone to wait
in their positions.

1491
01:43:23,293 --> 01:43:25,543
We will handle it once he
enters the house. - Okay, sir.

1492
01:43:52,293 --> 01:43:55,168
Put this on my tab.
Don’t tell Venus.

1493
01:44:13,665 --> 01:44:15,498
Sir, they are asking
if they can enter?

1494
01:44:16,852 --> 01:44:18,893
We are here unofficially.
- Correct, sir.

1495
01:44:18,918 --> 01:44:21,377
Ask them to wait till he enters.
- Okay, sir.

1496
01:45:43,168 --> 01:45:44,210
Adrian?

1497
01:45:44,762 --> 01:45:48,929
He is on a tour with his grandma for 15
days. I e-mailed you the leave letter.

1498
01:45:49,322 --> 01:45:51,447
It's okay. Read this.

1499
01:45:52,085 --> 01:45:53,710
An essay he wrote in class.

1500
01:45:54,252 --> 01:45:55,585
Please have a seat
there and read it.

1501
01:45:55,678 --> 01:45:57,470
I will finish some
work and talk to you.

1502
01:45:57,627 --> 01:45:58,627
Sure.

1503
01:46:20,502 --> 01:46:23,407
When everyone writes
about their sweet home,

1504
01:46:23,736 --> 01:46:26,401
it has a mother, father,
grandpa and grandma.

1505
01:46:26,619 --> 01:46:28,702
But in my sweet home,
there are only 3 people.

1506
01:46:28,866 --> 01:46:31,574
Me, mom and grandma.
There’s no dad.

1507
01:46:31,710 --> 01:46:35,627
Mom said dad went to
swim with the dolphins.

1508
01:46:35,793 --> 01:46:40,043
Then another day she told
someone he went to Australia.

1509
01:46:40,127 --> 01:46:44,418
Then on another day she
told someone he’s in Dubai.

1510
01:46:44,835 --> 01:46:47,210
I know very well that
my mom lied to me.

1511
01:46:47,330 --> 01:46:51,371
But I didn’t ask her why.
Because I love her so much.

1512
01:46:51,478 --> 01:46:57,228
One day, my grandma scolded
my mom with the word 'bitch'.

1513
01:46:57,550 --> 01:47:00,627
I think it’s a bad word.
But I’m not sure.

1514
01:47:00,652 --> 01:47:04,082
So my mom took me
and left the house.

1515
01:47:04,267 --> 01:47:08,725
Then one day, Beardwala came.
He swam with the dolphins.

1516
01:47:08,750 --> 01:47:10,480
I thought he could be my father.

1517
01:47:10,835 --> 01:47:16,722
Then one day, he called my mother a
bitch just like my grandma and left.

1518
01:47:16,944 --> 01:47:19,069
Only my mother and I
remain at our home.

1519
01:47:19,207 --> 01:47:22,915
Whenever this word came up,
it took my sweet home away.

1520
01:49:12,105 --> 01:49:21,522
If you’re contemplating suicide,
please call 104 immediately.

1521
01:49:22,050 --> 01:49:25,917
Government employees are
waiting to counsel you

1522
01:49:25,942 --> 01:49:29,732
with love and care to
help change your mind.

1523
01:51:30,308 --> 01:51:32,266
This is all you need.
- Don't overreact.

1524
01:51:32,377 --> 01:51:34,419
It’s been 15 days. And I
still haven't got my ring!

1525
01:51:35,522 --> 01:51:37,563
You want it without filing
a complaint, right?

1526
01:51:37,772 --> 01:51:40,980
And your Casanova has switched
off his phone for 15 days.

1527
01:51:41,063 --> 01:51:42,605
Can’t even tap it.

1528
01:51:42,938 --> 01:51:45,688
Wouldn’t it be better to file
a complaint? - A complaint?

1529
01:51:45,765 --> 01:51:48,849
That he brandished a knife and snatched
your ring when you were in public?

1530
01:51:49,147 --> 01:51:52,313
My husband has to believe it, right?
- He's just your husband. Wait.

1531
01:51:57,438 --> 01:51:59,688
Mr. Gupta. How are you?

1532
01:51:59,897 --> 01:52:01,522
I am at your place.

1533
01:52:01,688 --> 01:52:03,548
This morning when your
missus went for the walk...

1534
01:52:03,573 --> 01:52:06,740
somebody flashed a knife and stole
her wedding ring, it seems.

1535
01:52:07,112 --> 01:52:09,195
Sister is so upset.

1536
01:52:09,563 --> 01:52:12,897
She is fine. She is fine.
Can we file a complaint?

1537
01:52:14,508 --> 01:52:16,633
Sure, sure. Speak to her.

1538
01:52:19,605 --> 01:52:21,563
I will talk to you later.

1539
01:52:26,258 --> 01:52:29,092
You know I’m on another call. Why
the hell do you keep calling?

1540
01:52:29,313 --> 01:52:31,605
Sir, you asked us to tap
someone’s phone unofficially.

1541
01:52:31,630 --> 01:52:34,356
That guy turned his phone
on after a long time now...

1542
01:52:34,493 --> 01:52:37,535
and we tapped his last conversation
and sent it to you through WhatsApp.

1543
01:52:37,672 --> 01:52:39,297
Delete it once you're
done listening, sir.

1544
01:52:39,322 --> 01:52:43,155
Where are you speaking from? - Sir, I'm
outside the station. Nobody knows.

1545
01:52:43,522 --> 01:52:45,938
Okay, I'll call you back.
- Okay, sir.

1546
01:52:48,146 --> 01:52:50,229
Hello - Hello. Who's this?

1547
01:52:50,372 --> 01:52:52,747
You dont't know me. But
I know all about you.

1548
01:52:53,022 --> 01:52:53,829
Why did you call me?

1549
01:52:53,980 --> 01:52:55,876
This is guy, right?
- Yes, he is.

1550
01:52:55,970 --> 01:52:58,897
You have something I need. If you give
it to me, I will tell you something.

1551
01:52:58,897 --> 01:52:59,815
Tell me what?

1552
01:52:59,840 --> 01:53:01,881
Say that you'll come to my home.
Then I will tell you.

1553
01:53:02,120 --> 01:53:04,120
Sorry, I'm not who
you think I am.

1554
01:53:04,784 --> 01:53:06,522
Be whatever you want.

1555
01:53:06,772 --> 01:53:08,354
Come home and I will tell you.

1556
01:53:08,438 --> 01:53:09,897
Your wife?

1557
01:53:16,256 --> 01:53:18,506
Stop it! stop it!

1558
01:53:19,897 --> 01:53:22,938
Loose woman, you’re
laughing at a cop?

1559
01:53:23,063 --> 01:53:24,063
I’ll kill you!

1560
01:53:25,008 --> 01:53:27,425
Superb, Commissioner! Superb.

1561
01:53:27,688 --> 01:53:30,647
First go clean your home.
Then come to kill me.

1562
01:53:30,772 --> 01:53:31,897
I'll deal with you later.

1563
01:53:31,980 --> 01:53:33,938
He is going to kill me…?

1564
01:53:38,468 --> 01:53:39,802
Whose is this?

1565
01:53:40,133 --> 01:53:41,675
Mamta.

1566
01:53:42,522 --> 01:53:43,855
Mamta!

1567
01:53:45,772 --> 01:53:46,980
Can I keep this?

1568
01:53:47,355 --> 01:53:48,480
Keep it.

1569
01:53:49,830 --> 01:53:50,622
Thank you.

1570
01:53:50,740 --> 01:53:52,198
Okay. I’ll leave.

1571
01:53:52,230 --> 01:53:54,438
Wait. First drink some tea.

1572
01:53:58,105 --> 01:54:01,022
Asura - The epic story
of ten headed Ravana.

1573
01:54:03,748 --> 01:54:05,539
Can I have a look
at these paintings?

1574
01:54:05,844 --> 01:54:06,761
Sure.

1575
01:54:12,639 --> 01:54:15,055
Be careful. There
is broken glass.

1576
01:54:15,772 --> 01:54:17,611
He broke it a couple of
days ago in a fit of rage.

1577
01:54:17,636 --> 01:54:20,095
For asking whose phone
and ring it was.

1578
01:54:20,663 --> 01:54:24,038
I haven’t cleaned it yet,
hoping it will cut him.

1579
01:54:25,392 --> 01:54:26,122
No luck so far.

1580
01:54:29,980 --> 01:54:31,313
My daughter's paintings.

1581
01:54:31,897 --> 01:54:32,772
It's nice.

1582
01:54:32,942 --> 01:54:35,063
Not now. She painted
when she was a kid.

1583
01:54:35,147 --> 01:54:36,480
What is she studying now?

1584
01:54:36,637 --> 01:54:37,772
She is isn't studying.

1585
01:54:37,772 --> 01:54:39,105
She is no more.

1586
01:54:39,222 --> 01:54:40,139
Sorry.

1587
01:54:40,316 --> 01:54:44,524
It's okay. I'm always
alone in this house.

1588
01:54:45,188 --> 01:54:48,647
No one to talk to. No one
to ask if I've eaten.

1589
01:54:48,980 --> 01:54:50,980
No one to care for me.

1590
01:54:51,102 --> 01:54:52,811
On top of that, I have
a cop for a husband.

1591
01:54:53,378 --> 01:54:54,980
He treats me like a criminal.

1592
01:54:55,316 --> 01:54:58,772
For the first time in life, I've
got this proof to skin him alive.

1593
01:54:59,344 --> 01:55:01,569
Thanks a lot. - It's okay.

1594
01:55:01,594 --> 01:55:03,232
When you called that
day I misunderstood.

1595
01:55:04,264 --> 01:55:06,264
That's the only way men think.

1596
01:55:06,484 --> 01:55:08,276
Sorry. -It's okay.

1597
01:55:19,367 --> 01:55:22,010
I can't imagine what would've
become of me without these books.

1598
01:55:50,605 --> 01:55:52,272
Why have you left
the doors open?

1599
01:55:52,647 --> 01:55:54,438
My dearest emperor!

1600
01:55:54,688 --> 01:55:58,105
I regret causing
disappointment to you!

1601
01:55:58,230 --> 01:55:59,272
I’ll thrash you!

1602
01:56:00,860 --> 01:56:04,694
Who are you searching for? Wandering
in forest after forest? Sea after sea?

1603
01:56:04,906 --> 01:56:08,740
Oh? Are you searching
for Ravana?

1604
01:56:08,844 --> 01:56:10,136
My, my.

1605
01:56:10,352 --> 01:56:13,061
Your search is futile,
your majesty!

1606
01:56:13,147 --> 01:56:16,647
Shouldn’t you be
searching for me, Sita?

1607
01:56:17,063 --> 01:56:19,063
What the hell are you doing?
-I'm reading.

1608
01:56:19,167 --> 01:56:20,834
Reading a book now?

1609
01:56:23,355 --> 01:56:27,147
Why is My Lord drinking liqour
instead of searching for Ravana?

1610
01:56:27,414 --> 01:56:28,581
Teasing me?

1611
01:56:28,688 --> 01:56:29,647
Where is he?

1612
01:56:29,688 --> 01:56:30,938
Whom do you seek?

1613
01:56:36,397 --> 01:56:38,272
He may be Ravana.

1614
01:56:38,772 --> 01:56:40,313
And I may be Sita.

1615
01:56:41,316 --> 01:56:43,191
But you are not Rama.

1616
01:56:44,401 --> 01:56:46,526
You are certainly not Rama.

1617
01:56:48,147 --> 01:56:52,605
So you’re here? You
are dead today!

1618
01:56:53,522 --> 01:56:55,772
Come down. Come. - Sir, sir...!

1619
01:56:56,188 --> 01:56:57,647
Sir!

1620
01:56:57,772 --> 01:56:59,688
You dare to come here?
- Sir. Sir.

1621
01:56:59,688 --> 01:57:00,938
Don't hit the poor chap.

1622
01:57:01,122 --> 01:57:02,330
You came to steal?
- Yes, sir. I did.

1623
01:57:02,355 --> 01:57:05,230
You dare mess with me?
- Sir. I'm a thief.

1624
01:57:05,415 --> 01:57:07,313
Look at her when you say that!
- I'm telling the truth.

1625
01:57:07,355 --> 01:57:08,313
Don’t do this.

1626
01:57:08,338 --> 01:57:10,838
Look at her and say that.
- Please, leave him.

1627
01:57:10,897 --> 01:57:13,938
Tell her. Tell her. Tell her. Tell her.
- Leave him, please.

1628
01:57:13,938 --> 01:57:15,105
Let him go.

1629
01:57:15,688 --> 01:57:16,980
Let him go!

1630
01:57:17,563 --> 01:57:19,967
Let him go, man.
- You speak to me that way now?

1631
01:57:19,992 --> 01:57:21,617
I have given you more
respect than you deserve.

1632
01:57:21,772 --> 01:57:23,522
Run away. Run away now!

1633
01:57:23,563 --> 01:57:26,772
Where are you going?
- Let him go. He is innocent.

1634
01:57:26,892 --> 01:57:29,747
Is he? Is he a poor thing?

1635
01:57:29,772 --> 01:57:32,480
I'll kill you. Sit.

1636
01:57:32,688 --> 01:57:34,127
Tell me. Why did he come?

1637
01:57:34,152 --> 01:57:35,193
To sleep with you?

1638
01:57:35,563 --> 01:57:37,384
Why did he come here?
- Don't you know?

1639
01:57:37,409 --> 01:57:39,576
Did he come to sleep with you?
- YES.

1640
01:57:39,601 --> 01:57:41,226
How was he? Better than me?

1641
01:57:43,358 --> 01:57:45,316
How was he?

1642
01:57:45,688 --> 01:57:47,897
Much, much, much
better than you.

1643
01:57:48,521 --> 01:57:50,771
How was he? Better than me?

1644
01:57:50,855 --> 01:57:55,355
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.
Better than you!

1645
01:57:55,522 --> 01:57:58,438
He was superb. Superb. Superb.
Superb. Superb.

1646
01:57:58,480 --> 01:58:01,980
He was superb? Was he?
Was he superb?

1647
01:58:02,313 --> 01:58:03,024
Stop it...

1648
01:58:03,049 --> 01:58:07,466
Yes, he was! Superb, superb...
- Stop it, woman.

1649
01:58:07,605 --> 01:58:09,855
This guy was superb? Stop it!

1650
01:58:09,897 --> 01:58:11,688
STOP IT!

1651
01:58:11,897 --> 01:58:13,022
I won't.

1652
01:58:13,105 --> 01:58:17,236
SUPERB. SUPERB. SUPERB.
ARE YOU HAPPY NOW?

1653
01:58:17,353 --> 01:58:19,077
You came into MY house?

1654
01:58:19,521 --> 01:58:23,271
Why do you show your valor to him?
Come show it to me!

1655
01:58:23,778 --> 01:58:28,397
What did you say? I'll show you?
- Take your hands off me.

1656
01:58:28,438 --> 01:58:30,980
I’ll kill you! - I will scream.

1657
01:58:31,105 --> 01:58:33,105
Go on, scream! Scream!
Let me hear you.

1658
01:58:34,758 --> 01:58:38,217
Stop it! Stop it!

1659
01:58:41,313 --> 01:58:44,272
Stop screaming! Stop!

1660
01:58:52,605 --> 01:58:54,711
I knew it when I saw
you reading so much,

1661
01:58:54,736 --> 01:58:57,131
that you’ll sleep around
when I’m not around!

1662
01:58:57,820 --> 01:58:58,904
Bloody bitch!

1663
01:58:59,480 --> 01:59:00,980
Bloody educated bitch.

1664
01:59:03,862 --> 01:59:06,063
What do you know about books?
You police dog!

1665
01:59:06,284 --> 01:59:07,980
Not just when you aren’t around,
even when you are here...

1666
01:59:07,980 --> 01:59:10,772
I have and I will keep doing this.
- Watch your tongue.

1667
01:59:10,855 --> 01:59:11,855
I’ll shoot you.

1668
01:59:12,040 --> 01:59:14,438
You threaten to shoot me
once every three days!

1669
01:59:14,526 --> 01:59:16,443
If you want to shoot,
shoot, you mongrel.

1670
01:59:19,580 --> 01:59:24,029
Shoot! Shoot! Come!
Shoot me, you dog!

1671
01:59:24,078 --> 01:59:26,203
COME ON!

1672
01:59:27,525 --> 01:59:29,858
I’m coming...

1673
01:59:35,782 --> 01:59:37,032
I will shoot you!

1674
01:59:37,688 --> 01:59:39,188
Seriously, I will shoot you!

1675
01:59:40,015 --> 01:59:41,522
You don’t have the
balls to shoot me.

1676
01:59:41,625 --> 01:59:43,917
And you don’t deserve
to shoot me.

1677
01:59:44,579 --> 01:59:47,938
Don't, woman. Don't do it!

1678
01:59:50,647 --> 01:59:51,688
Don't!

1679
02:00:14,633 --> 02:00:16,008
Sorry, Althea...

1680
02:00:18,563 --> 02:00:20,438
Sorry, Althea..

1681
02:00:20,813 --> 02:00:22,438
I didn't do it on
purpose, Althea.

1682
02:00:22,855 --> 02:00:24,355
I shot you...

1683
02:00:26,770 --> 02:00:30,438
If I'd had a gun that day,
I would have shot you.

1684
02:00:31,022 --> 02:00:34,522
Why did you do this?
I didn’t shoot you.

1685
02:00:34,721 --> 02:00:36,804
Sorry, Althea. I shot you.

1686
02:00:37,772 --> 02:00:41,772
Why? Why did you do this? Why?

1687
02:00:42,022 --> 02:00:44,938
I didn't do it on purpose...

1688
02:00:46,357 --> 02:00:49,732
Please forgive me. I didn't
do it on purpose, Althea...

1689
02:00:52,230 --> 02:00:53,397
Get out.

1690
02:00:53,855 --> 02:00:54,772
Get out.

1691
02:00:55,855 --> 02:00:57,647
It was my fault, Althea.
- GET OUT!

1692
02:01:00,688 --> 02:01:03,272
Get out of my house. Go!

1693
02:01:04,938 --> 02:01:06,522
Get out.

1694
02:01:46,259 --> 02:01:50,313
Wife killed in a gas cylinder explosion.
Assistant commissioner under suspicion.

1695
02:01:50,355 --> 02:01:51,313
Oh, Jesus.

1696
02:02:08,772 --> 02:02:09,688
Sir...

1697
02:02:10,147 --> 02:02:12,355
Why do you shut the door on me?

1698
02:02:14,734 --> 02:02:17,938
I heard Rahim Bhai’s family is in Nagore.
That’s why I asked for the money back.

1699
02:02:17,980 --> 02:02:20,063
Did you mistake me for that?
Sir?

1700
02:02:20,398 --> 02:02:23,565
Please, sir.
- The money is in my lunch bag. Take it.

1701
02:02:24,772 --> 02:02:29,772
Forget about the money. Atleast
come out and slap me hard.

1702
02:02:31,516 --> 02:02:34,141
My elder daughter wanted the
chocolate box to keep her bangles.

1703
02:02:35,079 --> 02:02:36,288
Couldn't ask her to return it.

1704
02:02:36,359 --> 02:02:37,276
Please, sir.

1705
02:02:37,906 --> 02:02:39,406
That’s why I wrapped
the money in paper.

1706
02:02:39,554 --> 02:02:42,600
I never asked you for the chocolate box.
Why, sir?

1707
02:02:43,272 --> 02:02:46,522
Whatever it is, please tell
it to me face-to-face.

1708
02:02:46,772 --> 02:02:47,647
Look...

1709
02:02:49,480 --> 02:02:50,355
Get lost.

1710
02:02:50,482 --> 02:02:51,980
If I leave, I'll never return.

1711
02:02:52,191 --> 02:02:53,399
Listen to me. Go.

1712
02:03:11,230 --> 02:03:12,272
Sir?

1713
02:03:14,497 --> 02:03:15,851
Get lost. Get lost.

1714
02:03:15,876 --> 02:03:18,418
Please, sir.

1715
02:03:18,804 --> 02:03:20,179
Did you...?

1716
02:03:20,417 --> 02:03:21,334
Jesus!

1717
02:03:22,855 --> 02:03:24,063
That house...

1718
02:03:26,438 --> 02:03:28,722
Did you take my Venus'
number from my phone…?

1719
02:03:28,805 --> 02:03:31,639
I locked myself in the room, so
I wouldn’t ask such questions.

1720
02:03:31,855 --> 02:03:33,688
Leave now. Forgive me.

1721
02:03:34,201 --> 02:03:35,701
Not from your phone, sir.

1722
02:03:35,726 --> 02:03:37,642
I happened to find it
in a payphone booth.

1723
02:03:37,727 --> 02:03:39,000
Sorry, sir. Forgive me.

1724
02:03:39,025 --> 02:03:41,542
I didn’t know it was Venus’ number.
Please, sir.

1725
02:03:41,875 --> 02:03:44,792
Who am I to forgive you? Go now.

1726
02:03:46,562 --> 02:03:48,354
Don't make me talk.
Get lost from here.

1727
02:03:49,355 --> 02:03:50,772
I ruined your life.

1728
02:03:51,047 --> 02:03:52,922
I ruined everyone’s lives.

1729
02:03:54,313 --> 02:03:56,147
Who are you to ruin my life?

1730
02:03:56,417 --> 02:03:58,792
Nobody can ruin anybody’s life.

1731
02:04:00,187 --> 02:04:02,771
That night you went near my
place, the police came home.

1732
02:04:04,022 --> 02:04:06,688
Even a cop’s wife, will be
afraid of the police, right?

1733
02:04:07,224 --> 02:04:09,663
When I went home in the morning,
Venus told me everything.

1734
02:04:09,750 --> 02:04:11,042
The children weren’t around.

1735
02:04:11,456 --> 02:04:14,289
I slapped her. I
beat her like hell.

1736
02:04:15,022 --> 02:04:16,438
I strangled her neck.

1737
02:04:18,662 --> 02:04:20,412
I was afraid she would die.

1738
02:04:21,917 --> 02:04:25,292
Then I went to a bar
and drank to the brim.

1739
02:04:27,480 --> 02:04:29,980
I was afraid I would hurt
her more if I went home.

1740
02:04:31,409 --> 02:04:34,313
I went home late at night.
The door was open.

1741
02:04:35,688 --> 02:04:37,480
Venus and the kids
were sleeping inside.

1742
02:04:37,855 --> 02:04:39,855
Poor thing.

1743
02:04:41,201 --> 02:04:44,159
You know, I haven’t even raised a
little finger against her before?

1744
02:04:46,881 --> 02:04:47,922
Lust.

1745
02:04:49,063 --> 02:04:51,874
In my 23 years of married life, I
too have faltered a few times.

1746
02:04:52,016 --> 02:04:54,391
But I hid it. Because I’m a man.

1747
02:04:55,795 --> 02:04:57,795
But Venus, a woman,
confided in me.

1748
02:04:59,373 --> 02:05:02,017
If my daughter had done this, I would
have beat her and corrected her.

1749
02:05:02,042 --> 02:05:04,833
I would have done the same
with my sisters, too.

1750
02:05:06,933 --> 02:05:08,891
Venus is also somebody’s
older sister, too.

1751
02:05:10,772 --> 02:05:13,105
Venus is somebody's
little sister.

1752
02:05:15,563 --> 02:05:18,105
She's some father's
darling girl.

1753
02:05:20,890 --> 02:05:23,890
You’ve done a good thing, boy.

1754
02:05:24,569 --> 02:05:26,027
You didn’t ruin anything.

1755
02:05:28,938 --> 02:05:31,188
Come here, my boy. Come here!

1756
02:05:33,063 --> 02:05:34,438
I said, come.

1757
02:05:34,818 --> 02:05:37,234
I didn't know, sir. Forgive me.

1758
02:05:37,355 --> 02:05:38,147
Jesus.

1759
02:06:20,779 --> 02:06:23,070
Rahim Bhai from Chennai...?

1760
02:06:23,272 --> 02:06:24,897
Heard his family moved here.

1761
02:06:25,472 --> 02:06:26,805
The elders would know.

1762
02:06:26,855 --> 02:06:29,688
You come in the morning. I'll help.
You can sleep in the Dargah.

1763
02:06:30,188 --> 02:06:33,188
Anybody can sleep in the Dargah.
No problem.

1764
02:07:09,264 --> 02:07:10,147
Brother..

1765
02:07:11,063 --> 02:07:12,063
Keep this.

1766
02:07:12,455 --> 02:07:14,580
No, sir... - Don't worry.

1767
02:07:14,722 --> 02:07:16,889
We'll find Rahim
Bhai's house tomorrow.

1768
02:08:01,297 --> 02:08:03,797
Saharama! Saharama!

1769
02:08:06,003 --> 02:08:09,670
A man has come from
Chennai to see you.

1770
02:08:09,834 --> 02:08:10,959
Bye, Uncle.

1771
02:08:11,735 --> 02:08:13,902
I'm from Chennai. Rahim Bhai...?

1772
02:08:14,191 --> 02:08:15,358
He passed away.

1773
02:08:15,399 --> 02:08:16,483
I know.

1774
02:08:50,951 --> 02:08:52,492
Allah...

1775
02:08:53,632 --> 02:08:54,924
Who are you?

1776
02:09:00,230 --> 02:09:03,063
I saw your husband in
a train one night.

1777
02:09:04,063 --> 02:09:06,605
He was asleep.
Nobody was around.

1778
02:09:07,647 --> 02:09:09,855
He had 500 thousand
rupees in his bag.

1779
02:09:10,522 --> 02:09:13,230
I stole 300 thousand
rupeesfrom that.

1780
02:09:14,147 --> 02:09:19,272
I knew from the next day's newspaper
that he died of a heart attack.

1781
02:09:20,313 --> 02:09:24,563
He would’ve lived if I
had not taken the money.

1782
02:09:27,855 --> 02:09:30,147
Here is the 300 thousand rupees.

1783
02:09:30,605 --> 02:09:31,772
Please take it.

1784
02:09:38,633 --> 02:09:40,717
It’s not because of you, son.

1785
02:09:41,897 --> 02:09:45,647
He died of a heart attack at 6 PM,
according to the post-mortem report.

1786
02:09:45,855 --> 02:09:51,105
He was in the train – an orphaned
corpse – from morning to night.

1787
02:09:53,398 --> 02:09:56,023
But I am at fault.

1788
02:09:56,897 --> 02:09:58,897
I will accept any
punishment you give me.

1789
02:09:59,659 --> 02:10:01,605
Even if you hand me
over to the police.

1790
02:10:01,808 --> 02:10:04,475
Atleast take this money. Please.

1791
02:10:05,459 --> 02:10:06,709
Tonight...

1792
02:10:06,772 --> 02:10:13,563
our honourable Prime Minister is set to
announce that 500 and 1000 notes are invalid.

1793
02:10:14,443 --> 02:10:17,234
We don't know whether this
woman holds a bank account.

1794
02:10:17,573 --> 02:10:21,740
Or if she can exchange
the currency notes.

1795
02:10:22,318 --> 02:10:23,859
Vande Mataram.

1796
02:10:27,772 --> 02:10:28,938
Sahara.

1797
02:10:32,688 --> 02:10:34,855
Uncle… here.

1798
02:10:36,397 --> 02:10:37,355
Eat it.

1799
02:10:43,105 --> 02:10:44,980
Eat, child.

1800
02:10:48,219 --> 02:10:50,094
Don’t worry. Eat up.

1801
02:10:50,781 --> 02:10:51,948
I will.

1802
02:12:15,601 --> 02:12:16,393
Son!

1803
02:12:17,391 --> 02:12:18,266
Son!

1804
02:12:19,456 --> 02:12:20,789
Is this phone yours?

1805
02:12:21,397 --> 02:12:22,730
It was lying there.

1806
02:12:23,397 --> 02:12:24,272
It's not mine.

1807
02:12:24,730 --> 02:12:26,522
Not yours? It’s okay. Keep it.

1808
02:12:26,647 --> 02:12:28,348
No. You keep it.

1809
02:12:28,538 --> 02:12:29,872
I have a phone.

1810
02:12:29,897 --> 02:12:32,897
Your phone fell in the water, right?
You keep this.

1811
02:12:36,105 --> 02:12:37,563
I have nobody to talk to.

1812
02:12:37,758 --> 02:12:41,133
What are you saying? Don’t you
remember even one number?

1813
02:12:41,397 --> 02:12:43,272
I have committed many sins.

1814
02:12:44,022 --> 02:12:47,897
All your sins were washed away in
that water. Take this and talk.

1815
02:13:45,626 --> 02:13:46,876
What’s in the bag?

1816
02:13:49,269 --> 02:13:50,561
Bottles?

1817
02:13:51,697 --> 02:13:54,401
Give it to me. I’ll
give you money.

1818
02:13:56,230 --> 02:13:57,522
Who drank all this?

1819
02:13:58,672 --> 02:14:00,042
I’m asking you? Who drank this?

1820
02:14:00,105 --> 02:14:01,272
My father.

1821
02:14:59,938 --> 02:15:01,438
Are you okay, mom?

1822
02:15:08,709 --> 02:15:11,125
Promise not to get mad
if I say something?

1823
02:15:12,453 --> 02:15:13,287
What?

1824
02:15:14,235 --> 02:15:16,027
What is a 'bitch'?

1825
02:15:18,188 --> 02:15:19,105
Why?

1826
02:15:19,605 --> 02:15:21,522
Granny said you’re a 'bitch'.

1827
02:15:21,748 --> 02:15:23,748
Beardwala said you’re a bitch.

1828
02:15:23,972 --> 02:15:26,139
My school friends
say you’re a bitch.

1829
02:15:26,331 --> 02:15:27,956
Is that something wrong?

1830
02:15:38,063 --> 02:15:39,272
Love you, mom.

1831
02:15:48,495 --> 02:15:49,370
Hello.

1832
02:15:49,565 --> 02:15:51,232
Prabhu here, Althea.

1833
02:15:51,875 --> 02:15:54,709
Which Prabhu?
- Prabhunath here, Althea.

1834
02:15:55,232 --> 02:15:56,355
What do you want?

1835
02:15:56,438 --> 02:15:58,438
I feel like seeing you.

1836
02:15:58,807 --> 02:16:01,182
I don't feel like it.
If I do, I'll tell you.

1837
02:16:01,514 --> 02:16:04,639
No Althea, I'm here downstairs.
Can I come home?

1838
02:16:05,170 --> 02:16:07,586
Planning to create
a ruckus again?

1839
02:16:07,698 --> 02:16:09,448
No, Althea. Please!

1840
02:16:12,313 --> 02:16:14,688
First, go and stand at the main gate.
- Okay.

1841
02:17:09,269 --> 02:17:10,977
Tell me? What is it?

1842
02:17:12,938 --> 02:17:13,897
I just...

1843
02:17:14,560 --> 02:17:16,018
wanted to see you.

1844
02:17:16,522 --> 02:17:17,480
That's all.

1845
02:17:19,422 --> 02:17:20,506
Now you've seen me.

1846
02:17:22,425 --> 02:17:23,545
You've seen me?

1847
02:17:25,779 --> 02:17:26,779
So leave.

1848
02:17:26,906 --> 02:17:27,781
Althea, wait!

1849
02:17:29,123 --> 02:17:30,373
I need to talk to you.

1850
02:17:41,279 --> 02:17:42,320
Tell me.

1851
02:17:43,480 --> 02:17:45,438
Forgive me, Althea.

1852
02:17:46,964 --> 02:17:48,214
Okay. Then?

1853
02:17:49,699 --> 02:17:52,230
It was all my fault.

1854
02:17:52,524 --> 02:17:53,858
Okay. Then?

1855
02:17:55,609 --> 02:17:59,984
I have really changed, Althea.

1856
02:18:01,315 --> 02:18:02,023
Okay.

1857
02:18:03,503 --> 02:18:04,253
Then?

1858
02:18:05,480 --> 02:18:07,980
Please forgive me, Althea.
Please.

1859
02:18:08,862 --> 02:18:10,070
Okay. I’ve forgiven you.

1860
02:18:11,570 --> 02:18:12,820
Now, leave. Please.

1861
02:18:13,300 --> 02:18:14,425
Althea, stop.

1862
02:18:14,450 --> 02:18:15,408
Althea, please.

1863
02:18:15,480 --> 02:18:16,980
Stop Althea. Althea,
listen to me.

1864
02:18:17,855 --> 02:18:19,563
Please wait, Althea.
Listen to me.

1865
02:18:19,897 --> 02:18:21,897
Just wait a second, Althea.

1866
02:18:22,143 --> 02:18:24,768
One second, Althea.
Please, Althea.

1867
02:18:24,793 --> 02:18:25,834
What?

1868
02:18:27,709 --> 02:18:30,167
Please forgive me, Althea.
Please.

1869
02:18:32,956 --> 02:18:34,706
Who am I to forgive you?

1870
02:18:35,328 --> 02:18:40,037
You did to me what
most men do to women.

1871
02:18:40,584 --> 02:18:43,000
I didn’t mean to do it, Althea.
Please.

1872
02:18:43,025 --> 02:18:44,025
No, Prabhu.

1873
02:18:44,483 --> 02:18:45,608
Only difference is...

1874
02:18:46,568 --> 02:18:49,526
when everyone I came across
only wanted to sleep with me,

1875
02:18:50,339 --> 02:18:52,631
you’re the only one who
wanted to live with me.

1876
02:18:54,493 --> 02:18:56,160
You gave me so much happiness.

1877
02:18:56,899 --> 02:18:58,774
You gave me a lot of pain.

1878
02:19:00,584 --> 02:19:02,334
You gave me
everything in excess.

1879
02:19:04,749 --> 02:19:08,040
Enough, Prabhu. Please. I
can’t do this anymore.

1880
02:19:08,812 --> 02:19:13,729
I won’t do this again, Althea.
Please Althea.

1881
02:19:14,066 --> 02:19:15,191
No, Prabhu.

1882
02:19:15,516 --> 02:19:17,891
You and I are fighting...?
That's fine.

1883
02:19:18,545 --> 02:19:19,628
But Adrian?

1884
02:19:21,615 --> 02:19:23,865
You didn’t feel like
seeing him even once?

1885
02:19:24,606 --> 02:19:27,647
No, I wanted to Althea.
I really wanted to.

1886
02:19:30,062 --> 02:19:32,937
It’s not just your fault Prabhu.
It's mine too.

1887
02:19:34,367 --> 02:19:35,742
When you were with me...

1888
02:19:36,359 --> 02:19:37,901
I thought you were everything.

1889
02:19:39,940 --> 02:19:41,232
I even forgot Adrian.

1890
02:19:42,903 --> 02:19:45,427
I didn’t even worry
what he would think.

1891
02:19:47,678 --> 02:19:49,897
I can’t repeat that
mistake, Prabhu.

1892
02:19:52,188 --> 02:19:55,063
No, Althea. Please listen to me.
Please.

1893
02:19:55,250 --> 02:19:56,375
Please, Prabhu.

1894
02:19:57,647 --> 02:19:59,063
Do me this one favour.

1895
02:20:03,983 --> 02:20:05,483
I like you very much.

1896
02:20:05,878 --> 02:20:07,670
That's why I am asking
you this favour. Okay?

1897
02:20:09,554 --> 02:20:10,804
I will surely do it, Althea.

1898
02:20:11,451 --> 02:20:12,576
Surely.

1899
02:20:13,139 --> 02:20:15,014
Hereafter, don’t
come back to see me.

1900
02:20:15,513 --> 02:20:16,846
Don’t call me.

1901
02:20:18,910 --> 02:20:21,077
If possible, leave this city.
Please.

1902
02:20:23,852 --> 02:20:24,977
Because...

1903
02:20:29,101 --> 02:20:31,018
if you come back,
I’ll be disturbed.

1904
02:20:33,980 --> 02:20:35,480
That's why I am asking you this.

1905
02:20:37,592 --> 02:20:39,008
Will you do this for me?

1906
02:20:52,893 --> 02:20:54,397
I’ll do it.

1907
02:20:56,647 --> 02:20:58,063
Okay. Thanks.

1908
02:20:59,039 --> 02:21:00,081
Take care.

1909
02:21:18,167 --> 02:21:19,084
What?

1910
02:21:20,508 --> 02:21:23,925
It will take at least a
minute to reach the elevator.

1911
02:21:25,089 --> 02:21:26,631
Can I walk with you till then?

1912
02:21:30,685 --> 02:21:32,685
Don’t deny me this. Please.

1913
02:22:05,427 --> 02:22:09,385
It would take atleast a minute
for the elevator to your floor.

1914
02:22:09,484 --> 02:22:11,276
I swear, I will leave then.

1915
02:22:50,328 --> 02:22:52,370
All the best. Bye.

1916
02:24:26,619 --> 02:24:32,397
When a girl tells a guy to leave
her because she loves him...

1917
02:24:33,025 --> 02:24:37,897
after doing everything
that he normally does...

1918
02:24:38,007 --> 02:24:43,264
after apologising to her
with all those roses...

1919
02:25:23,449 --> 02:25:30,241
Pristine raindrops and the purest love
are the dirt that cleansed from the sea.

1920
02:25:30,948 --> 02:25:34,740
You must be thinking, why does this
guy keep talking during a movie?

1921
02:25:35,688 --> 02:25:37,438
People update their Facebook
status during movies.

1922
02:25:37,901 --> 02:25:39,901
And I update mine IN the movie.

1923
02:25:40,136 --> 02:25:41,011
That's all.

1924
02:25:41,203 --> 02:25:42,162
Thanks.
