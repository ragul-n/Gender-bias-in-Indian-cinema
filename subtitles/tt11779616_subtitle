1
00:05:35,453 --> 00:05:37,670
Close the windows and drive. I
have been saying this to many people.

2
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,455
Why sir? Any problem?

3
00:05:39,608 --> 00:05:41,393
Are you new to Ranagiri?
- Yes sir.

4
00:05:41,473 --> 00:05:44,486
Okay. Okay. Close the windows

5
00:05:44,852 --> 00:05:48,332
and drive without stopping
even if you hear any sound.

6
00:05:48,498 --> 00:05:50,255
Close the windows and go.

7
00:05:50,401 --> 00:05:51,549
Go.

8
00:06:08,527 --> 00:06:09,357
What happened?

9
00:06:12,042 --> 00:06:13,522
Sir, car not starting.

10
00:06:14,235 --> 00:06:15,439
Go and check.

11
00:06:15,868 --> 00:06:17,224
Will get down and check.

12
00:06:25,202 --> 00:06:26,120
Anwar!

13
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:41,008
Anwar!

14
00:06:43,454 --> 00:06:45,324
'Roshan!'

15
00:06:52,534 --> 00:06:54,329
'Roshan!'

16
00:06:57,075 --> 00:06:58,599
'Roshan!'

17
00:07:03,562 --> 00:07:04,913
Sir!

18
00:07:06,296 --> 00:07:09,129
Look there! Something fell...

19
00:07:10,967 --> 00:07:13,907
What fell down?
- I felt something fell...

20
00:07:16,642 --> 00:07:17,775
Where did you go?

21
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:21,071
I saw a hotel on the way.
Since the car got repaired

22
00:07:21,235 --> 00:07:22,818
I thought we could get some help.

23
00:07:22,898 --> 00:07:24,098
We will get some
help if we go there.

24
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:26,269
Alright.

25
00:07:26,658 --> 00:07:28,501
Lock the car.
- Okay sir.

26
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:11,647
Hello sir. Seen you somewhere.

27
00:08:12,063 --> 00:08:13,135
Very familiar face.

28
00:08:13,215 --> 00:08:16,076
Sir, he is home minister
Rajiv Ravi's son, Roshan Ravi.

29
00:08:16,499 --> 00:08:19,353
Welcome to Ranagiri.
We have 6 rooms.

30
00:08:20,071 --> 00:08:21,783
Are you a bachelor or married?
- Look,

31
00:08:22,181 --> 00:08:23,695
I have not come here to stay.

32
00:08:23,989 --> 00:08:25,001
There is some problem
with the car.

33
00:08:25,321 --> 00:08:26,722
Is there a mechanic here?

34
00:08:27,362 --> 00:08:29,602
Mechanic will not be
available here at this time.

35
00:08:29,682 --> 00:08:31,037
I will surely help
you tomorrow morning.

36
00:08:31,201 --> 00:08:34,791
You do not realize my urgency.
I have to go to Bangalore.

37
00:08:35,119 --> 00:08:36,961
I understand your urgency

38
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:40,914
but I think you do
not know about Ranagiri.

39
00:08:41,649 --> 00:08:44,157
No one moves around
after it is dark.

40
00:08:45,923 --> 00:08:47,782
Brother! Tea.

41
00:08:48,154 --> 00:08:49,564
Sir please.
- Yes.

42
00:08:49,918 --> 00:08:51,509
You are visiting Ranagiri
for the 1st time.

43
00:08:51,665 --> 00:08:53,542
It is not safe to travel at night.

44
00:08:54,294 --> 00:08:56,612
Yes sir.
Even I would suggest the same.

45
00:08:57,789 --> 00:08:59,873
Okay. You guys have convinced me.

46
00:09:00,453 --> 00:09:01,491
But one thing...

47
00:09:01,571 --> 00:09:04,276
Do not address me brother.
Call me Roshan.

48
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:13,720
Come. I will show you the room.
Please...

49
00:09:15,129 --> 00:09:16,156
Anwar!
- Sir.

50
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:18,720
Car should be ready in the morning.
We should leave for our place.

51
00:09:18,876 --> 00:09:19,723
Alright sir.

52
00:09:24,834 --> 00:09:26,965
Why are you carrying the luggage?

53
00:09:27,194 --> 00:09:28,100
Don't you have boys to help you?

54
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,888
Whoever joins here leave
the job within a month.

55
00:09:31,151 --> 00:09:32,922
I am fed up of searching.

56
00:09:33,101 --> 00:09:34,955
Why? What is the problem here?

57
00:09:35,121 --> 00:09:36,076
Curse.

58
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:40,143
Since British period there was a
fear that sorcery is practiced here.

59
00:09:40,223 --> 00:09:41,707
That fear still persists.

60
00:09:41,787 --> 00:09:43,956
Is that why guards at the check post

61
00:09:44,036 --> 00:09:46,321
told me to raise the window glass?
- Yes sir.

62
00:09:46,401 --> 00:09:48,736
I am also trying to
sell my property here.

63
00:09:48,816 --> 00:09:50,245
But no buyers.

64
00:09:50,431 --> 00:09:51,462
Please this way.

65
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:00,616
Don't we get mobile network here?

66
00:10:00,771 --> 00:10:02,670
Network is not very strong.

67
00:10:03,705 --> 00:10:05,216
Sir, one personal request.

68
00:10:05,296 --> 00:10:07,734
It is not safe to come
out of the room at night.

69
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,726
Call the landline number
if you need anything.

70
00:10:10,031 --> 00:10:10,966
Sir, take the key.

71
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:12,040
Yes.

72
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,480
Good night, sir.
- Good night.

73
00:10:44,915 --> 00:10:47,131
'How do you hit that down there?'

74
00:10:49,844 --> 00:10:52,817
'That is picked up.
Beautifully batted!'

75
00:10:56,662 --> 00:10:57,734
'Roshan!'

76
00:11:39,771 --> 00:11:41,561
Sir, Roshan.

77
00:12:09,685 --> 00:12:11,069
My son is not dead.

78
00:12:11,969 --> 00:12:12,937
Still there is time.

79
00:12:13,474 --> 00:12:14,477
Rahim!
- Sir.

80
00:12:14,737 --> 00:12:16,951
Send the best officer from
your department to Ranagiri.

81
00:12:17,031 --> 00:12:18,568
Yes sir.
- I should know

82
00:12:18,648 --> 00:12:19,926
what happened to my son.

83
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:22,243
Keep it off the record.

84
00:12:23,255 --> 00:12:25,686
You still have 48 hours from now.
- Definitely sir.

85
00:12:25,848 --> 00:12:28,152
This information should not
be leaked to media for any reason.

86
00:12:28,232 --> 00:12:29,276
Alright sir.

87
00:12:29,356 --> 00:12:30,338
Yes sir.
- Okay.

88
00:12:30,418 --> 00:12:31,375
Okay.

89
00:12:33,685 --> 00:12:35,415
This way, sir.

90
00:12:36,271 --> 00:12:37,655
Do not send...

91
00:12:43,076 --> 00:12:43,920
What happened?

92
00:12:44,941 --> 00:12:47,778
What sort of a man he is?
Never attends to calls.

93
00:12:48,202 --> 00:12:50,096
He calls the next
day after a missed call.

94
00:12:50,382 --> 00:12:51,654
Wonder where he is now!

95
00:12:51,734 --> 00:12:52,735
Who is he?

96
00:12:52,815 --> 00:12:57,059
He is the Sherlock Holmes
of our department.

97
00:12:57,691 --> 00:12:59,741
He is a crazy fellow.

98
00:12:59,922 --> 00:13:03,442
He imagines things and solves
crimes through his imagination.

99
00:13:04,047 --> 00:13:07,083
His name is Shivaji Surathkal.

100
00:13:30,205 --> 00:13:31,373
Sir.
- Shivaji.

101
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:33,915
How many times should I call you?
You are responding now.

102
00:13:34,329 --> 00:13:36,223
There is an important case.
Where are you?

103
00:13:36,303 --> 00:13:41,386
A Psycho has been dodging
our department since 3-4 years.

104
00:13:41,466 --> 00:13:42,943
Got a clue about him.
I am on that sir.

105
00:13:43,023 --> 00:13:45,451
Shivaji drop that psycho case.

106
00:13:45,763 --> 00:13:49,110
Go immediately to a place
called Ranagiri near Madikeri.

107
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:50,049
Madikeri!

108
00:13:55,726 --> 00:13:56,634
'Ji!'

109
00:13:57,845 --> 00:13:58,745
Shivaji!

110
00:13:58,825 --> 00:13:59,800
'Ji!'

111
00:14:00,259 --> 00:14:01,798
Shivaji!
- 'Ji!'

112
00:14:02,577 --> 00:14:03,390
'Ji!'

113
00:14:03,675 --> 00:14:05,768
Shivaji, can you hear me?

114
00:14:05,941 --> 00:14:06,918
Yes sir.

115
00:14:06,998 --> 00:14:09,349
Sir, I do not want
to handle this case.

116
00:14:09,429 --> 00:14:10,447
Come on Shivaji?

117
00:14:10,527 --> 00:14:13,197
Why are you still
brooding over the past?

118
00:14:13,277 --> 00:14:15,939
I know that you have not
gone to Madikeri since 5 years.

119
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:18,880
I am not asking you to
go now for a personal case.

120
00:14:19,148 --> 00:14:20,938
It is an official case.

121
00:14:21,137 --> 00:14:22,997
Sir, but I am really...
- No excuses.

122
00:14:23,619 --> 00:14:27,096
I am sending all the information
that you require though Whatsapp.

123
00:14:27,373 --> 00:14:28,731
Go to Madikeri immediately.

124
00:14:29,224 --> 00:14:30,123
Fine sir.

125
00:14:32,267 --> 00:14:33,123
Govindu!
- Sir.

126
00:14:33,203 --> 00:14:35,104
Take U turn.
We should go to Madikeri.

127
00:14:36,072 --> 00:14:37,369
Madikeri?!
- Yes.

128
00:14:42,655 --> 00:14:43,883
Where are you going?

129
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:45,785
Madikeri?

130
00:14:46,512 --> 00:14:47,775
One more new case?

131
00:14:48,199 --> 00:14:51,140
'Yes. Case No.101.'

132
00:14:51,364 --> 00:14:56,216
'It is actually a very interesting
and bizarre case in my experience.'

133
00:14:56,296 --> 00:14:58,421
'The dead person's name is Roshan,'

134
00:14:58,603 --> 00:15:00,506
'son of home minister Rajiv Ravi.'

135
00:15:00,661 --> 00:15:04,294
'The place where he died is
Ranagiri, near Madikeri.'

136
00:15:04,597 --> 00:15:07,183
'I have exactly 48 hours
to crack this case.'

137
00:15:07,408 --> 00:15:09,994
'And my time starts now.'

138
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,159
He died of fear.

139
00:15:20,568 --> 00:15:22,311
No blood stains. Heart attack?

140
00:15:22,526 --> 00:15:24,560
May be. Only postmortem can confirm.

141
00:15:33,383 --> 00:15:34,469
Rigor mortis set in.

142
00:15:34,704 --> 00:15:37,043
So he must have died
minimum 8 hours back.

143
00:15:41,802 --> 00:15:42,998
Two finger rings in his right hand.

144
00:15:43,171 --> 00:15:44,334
One new and another old.

145
00:15:44,672 --> 00:15:45,876
New one is in his ring finger.

146
00:15:45,956 --> 00:15:47,910
He must have got engaged recently.

147
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:49,792
Or is it the girl's gift?

148
00:15:55,028 --> 00:15:56,169
Govindu!
- Sir.

149
00:15:56,437 --> 00:15:57,510
Take out your wallet.

150
00:16:00,243 --> 00:16:01,566
Govinda is a right hander.

151
00:16:01,646 --> 00:16:03,831
So he keeps his wallet
in the right side of his pant.

152
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:06,867
He has kept it left side.
So he must be left hander.

153
00:16:07,143 --> 00:16:08,579
Watch is on the left hand.

154
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:12,237
There is a scratch in the watch!

155
00:16:18,051 --> 00:16:20,291
Victim's height - Almost 6 ft.

156
00:16:22,888 --> 00:16:24,349
Where is the driver
who was with him?

157
00:16:24,429 --> 00:16:26,694
Sir, driver is missing.
- What do you mean?

158
00:16:26,774 --> 00:16:28,285
He is missing since yesterday night.

159
00:16:28,365 --> 00:16:30,654
I see. Arrange for a search party.
- Yes sir.

160
00:16:30,734 --> 00:16:31,678
Fax his photo to
local police station

161
00:16:31,758 --> 00:16:32,652
and tell them to search for him.

162
00:16:32,732 --> 00:16:34,702
Okay sir.
- Shift this body to mortuary.

163
00:16:34,782 --> 00:16:37,192
Should get the
post mortem report fast.

164
00:16:37,272 --> 00:16:39,745
Yes sir.
- Right. You look smart.

165
00:16:39,926 --> 00:16:41,215
Thank you sir.
- What is your height?

166
00:16:41,295 --> 00:16:44,597
5'11"
- Oh! Almost 6'. Can you swim?

167
00:16:44,995 --> 00:16:47,347
No sir. Played in well water.
That's all.

168
00:16:54,419 --> 00:16:56,246
I thought you will drown.
But you survived.

169
00:16:57,255 --> 00:16:58,155
Sir!

170
00:16:59,703 --> 00:17:02,306
How will a 6' tall
person drown in 5' water?

171
00:17:02,386 --> 00:17:03,431
No chance.

172
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,723
Something is wrong.
Something is wrong here.

173
00:17:06,423 --> 00:17:09,562
Something is wrong about this place.
Something wrong...

174
00:17:09,804 --> 00:17:11,248
Something...

175
00:17:21,824 --> 00:17:22,883
Roshan's mobile.

176
00:17:29,233 --> 00:17:31,038
Who shifted the body?
- Me.

177
00:17:31,403 --> 00:17:33,108
Who are you?
- This resort owner.

178
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:34,690
Order a coffee.

179
00:17:37,016 --> 00:17:39,740
So... You are Pritam Shetty.
- Yes sir.

180
00:17:40,129 --> 00:17:41,781
Your wife's name is Smitha Shetty.

181
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:43,779
You both got married
on 26th Jan 2013.

182
00:17:43,859 --> 00:17:46,209
You were working as
pilot in Commercial Airline.

183
00:17:46,289 --> 00:17:49,311
But now you have resigned
the job and managing this resort.

184
00:17:49,391 --> 00:17:50,271
Am I right?

185
00:17:51,092 --> 00:17:54,465
Yes sir. You are right.
But how do you know this?

186
00:17:54,545 --> 00:17:58,789
Can make out from your bright face.

187
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:02,560
No dark circles. No wrinkles.
So you do not work in the open.

188
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,558
You work happily
and comfortably in AC.

189
00:18:04,638 --> 00:18:07,499
But not IT job.
No fat. You are physically fit.

190
00:18:07,663 --> 00:18:10,119
You are 6' tall.
Hairstyle is perfect.

191
00:18:10,199 --> 00:18:12,083
Side locks trimmed properly.

192
00:18:12,163 --> 00:18:15,681
Classy body language... Classy...
Even the perfume.

193
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:20,740
So you were in a job which gave
importance to physical appearance.

194
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,201
Which job?!

195
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,356
By seeing the photos
hung at the back,

196
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,603
I can make out you have seen
nook and corner of this world.

197
00:18:26,683 --> 00:18:31,517
Your favorite collections
explain that you love flying.

198
00:18:31,716 --> 00:18:34,811
The gift bag given by
Air Asia to Pilots is lying there.

199
00:18:34,891 --> 00:18:36,852
So you are a commercial Pilot.

200
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:39,507
But what made you
leave the job? Why?

201
00:18:40,242 --> 00:18:43,104
The photo there shows
you without specs.

202
00:18:43,184 --> 00:18:44,998
But now you use specs.

203
00:18:45,078 --> 00:18:47,230
Still no specs mark on your nose.

204
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:49,686
So you must have
got eye power recently.

205
00:18:49,766 --> 00:18:50,646
You know the rule...

206
00:18:50,726 --> 00:18:53,869
One can work as pilot
only if he has perfect vision.

207
00:18:53,949 --> 00:18:56,294
So you lost your pilot job.
Where else will you work then?

208
00:18:56,374 --> 00:18:59,901
Another photo there shows your
entire family belongs to this place.

209
00:18:59,981 --> 00:19:02,163
So you have come here

210
00:19:02,243 --> 00:19:05,823
to live happily with family
and managing this resort.

211
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:07,802
Am I right again?

212
00:19:07,882 --> 00:19:09,197
You are absolutely right sir.

213
00:19:09,277 --> 00:19:12,764
Yes. Shivaji Surathkal
is always right.

214
00:19:13,217 --> 00:19:14,526
But how did you know
our marriage date?

215
00:19:14,698 --> 00:19:15,974
Very simple. Facebook profile?

216
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:17,683
But I am not active on Facebook.

217
00:19:17,763 --> 00:19:22,965
You may not be active.
But your wife is very active.

218
00:19:26,878 --> 00:19:30,571
But no updates since 4-5 months.

219
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,693
Any problem?

220
00:19:33,892 --> 00:19:35,293
No... No problem.

221
00:19:35,373 --> 00:19:37,231
Right. Let me come to the point.

222
00:19:37,311 --> 00:19:39,688
When Roshan fell into the
swimming pool, his watch stopped.

223
00:19:39,768 --> 00:19:42,533
According to me,
time of death is 1.30 at night.

224
00:19:42,686 --> 00:19:48,089
But you informed local
SI Rudresh at 5.30 in the morning.

225
00:19:48,169 --> 00:19:52,040
Why so much delay?

226
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:54,191
There was phone network problem.

227
00:19:54,419 --> 00:19:56,349
So could not call the station.

228
00:19:56,516 --> 00:19:59,305
I had to go and call SI Rudresh.

229
00:19:59,685 --> 00:20:01,560
So it got little delayed.
- Little!

230
00:20:16,619 --> 00:20:17,786
Govindu.
- Yes sir.

231
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,654
Give this for laundry.
- Okay sir.

232
00:20:19,734 --> 00:20:20,791
Thank you for the room.

233
00:20:20,871 --> 00:20:23,057
Welcome sir.
How many days will you be here?

234
00:20:23,321 --> 00:20:25,639
My wish. Till the case is solved.

235
00:20:25,783 --> 00:20:27,430
Okay sir.
- Contact that tall inspector.

236
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:28,454
Rudresh.
- Yes.

237
00:20:28,534 --> 00:20:31,311
Tell him that my tablets
are over and ask him to get.

238
00:20:31,391 --> 00:20:32,840
Will send Whatsapp message.
- Very important.

239
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,795
Right sir.

240
00:20:35,607 --> 00:20:36,936
How many rooms are
there in your resort?

241
00:20:37,016 --> 00:20:37,953
Total 6 rooms.

242
00:20:38,033 --> 00:20:39,869
Roshan's room number?
- 1001

243
00:20:40,353 --> 00:20:42,332
1001
- Yes sir.

244
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:46,345
Pritam, what is your opinion
about home minister's son Roshan?

245
00:20:46,425 --> 00:20:47,469
In what way?

246
00:20:47,549 --> 00:20:49,707
About his character.
You have spoken to him.

247
00:20:49,787 --> 00:20:51,955
What do you think about him?

248
00:20:52,035 --> 00:20:53,891
Being minister's son... So...

249
00:20:54,129 --> 00:20:57,459
Arrogant, haughty, high handedness.

250
00:20:57,539 --> 00:20:59,059
So you did not like him.

251
00:20:59,139 --> 00:21:00,951
Sir, I did not say like that.

252
00:21:01,124 --> 00:21:04,292
You didn't say. But you think so...

253
00:21:04,519 --> 00:21:06,281
No sir. He was good...

254
00:21:06,616 --> 00:21:10,064
You may say so but your
eyes say he was bad. Was he bad?

255
00:21:10,301 --> 00:21:12,409
Sir...
- Right. Let us stop this topic.

256
00:21:12,489 --> 00:21:13,847
Show me Roshan's room.
- Sir, this way.

257
00:21:13,927 --> 00:21:14,946
Oh! That way.

258
00:21:29,248 --> 00:21:30,459
Jaanu!

259
00:21:33,096 --> 00:21:36,600
Jaanu! Brought your favorite coffee.

260
00:21:37,454 --> 00:21:38,848
Come here.

261
00:21:45,902 --> 00:21:47,708
Jaanu! Where are you?

262
00:21:53,129 --> 00:21:54,318
Jaanu!

263
00:21:55,356 --> 00:21:56,653
Where did Gulma go?

264
00:21:57,091 --> 00:22:00,182
'Mahesh was kidnapping girls'
- Why have you played TV so loudly?

265
00:22:00,262 --> 00:22:02,136
'from Mysore, Bangalore,
Hubli, Mangalore,'

266
00:22:02,216 --> 00:22:03,708
'Bombay throughout the country...'

267
00:22:08,444 --> 00:22:09,600
Jaanu!

268
00:22:19,603 --> 00:22:20,615
Jaanu!

269
00:23:17,885 --> 00:23:19,371
'Ji!'

270
00:24:14,417 --> 00:24:19,759
'Four years back, on May 15th 2015,'

271
00:24:20,084 --> 00:24:24,959
'both Janani and Gulma
went missing from house.'

272
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:27,922
'Janani's phone was not reachable.'

273
00:24:28,246 --> 00:24:29,684
'Where did Janani go?'

274
00:25:23,249 --> 00:25:24,157
Note this.

275
00:25:25,108 --> 00:25:26,751
Only one pair of clothes is packed.

276
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:28,161
So it is a one day trip.

277
00:25:29,406 --> 00:25:32,796
I think Roshan was a
neat and organized person.

278
00:25:32,952 --> 00:25:33,972
How do you say?

279
00:25:34,052 --> 00:25:35,183
Apart from clothes,

280
00:25:35,263 --> 00:25:37,527
he has packed other items
in the individual packets correctly.

281
00:25:37,864 --> 00:25:42,708
Trimmer, cosmetics, shampoo, belt...

282
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:47,231
Look at this beauty.
Beretta M9 semi automatic.

283
00:25:47,612 --> 00:25:49,333
He is minister's son. Self defence?

284
00:25:57,299 --> 00:25:59,002
There was something in this cover.

285
00:25:59,781 --> 00:26:00,724
But not there now.

286
00:26:01,096 --> 00:26:02,082
What would it have been?

287
00:26:02,679 --> 00:26:04,945
Check Roshan's recent Facebook post.

288
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,400
I will check the Instagram.

289
00:26:11,464 --> 00:26:12,474
Pretty girlfriend!

290
00:26:13,124 --> 00:26:16,030
Dr Anjali. Oh! Psychiatrist.

291
00:26:21,906 --> 00:26:23,151
We have a problem. Come.

292
00:26:26,066 --> 00:26:26,915
Govindu!
- Sir.

293
00:26:26,995 --> 00:26:29,014
Close and seal all
the exits of the resort.

294
00:26:29,094 --> 00:26:30,470
Yes sir
- No one should go out.

295
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:32,163
Yes sir. But why sir?

296
00:26:32,413 --> 00:26:34,234
It is not a natural death.

297
00:26:34,314 --> 00:26:35,541
Somebody has murdered him.

298
00:26:35,621 --> 00:26:39,247
How do you say it is murder?
So soon?

299
00:26:39,454 --> 00:26:40,984
From the Instagram photos,

300
00:26:41,064 --> 00:26:44,533
I could see that Roshan has won
prize in swimming in high school.

301
00:26:44,713 --> 00:26:45,834
He is an expert swimmer.

302
00:26:45,986 --> 00:26:47,681
How will he drown in water and die?

303
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:51,694
Point sir. But it can be suicide?

304
00:26:52,607 --> 00:26:55,174
Think that you are Roshan.
- Yes sir.

305
00:26:55,254 --> 00:26:59,028
If you have a loaded
revolver in hand,

306
00:26:59,108 --> 00:27:02,959
won't you shoot yourself and die

307
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:05,676
rather than search
for water and drown in it?

308
00:27:05,756 --> 00:27:06,700
Excellent sir.

309
00:27:06,837 --> 00:27:10,975
So this is not accident or suicide.

310
00:27:11,514 --> 00:27:14,268
It is a cold blooded murder.

311
00:27:15,887 --> 00:27:21,076
And there should be a murderer here.

312
00:27:21,374 --> 00:27:22,370
Come. Let us search.

313
00:27:22,923 --> 00:27:23,830
Hello!
- Hello!

314
00:27:24,157 --> 00:27:25,003
Hello!

315
00:27:25,175 --> 00:27:26,802
Hello! Hello!

316
00:27:27,156 --> 00:27:28,313
Did Janani come there today?

317
00:27:28,468 --> 00:27:29,443
No. She has not come.

318
00:27:29,523 --> 00:27:31,623
'It is 12.30 in the afternoon.'

319
00:27:31,894 --> 00:27:33,914
'I have been calling
everyone since one hour.'

320
00:27:33,994 --> 00:27:35,979
'Nobody had information
about Janani.'

321
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:38,309
'Called Govindu and told
him to come to my house.'

322
00:27:57,579 --> 00:27:59,939
You may attend call later.
There has been a murder here.

323
00:28:00,195 --> 00:28:02,430
Sorry sir.
- Time of death is 1.30 at night.

324
00:28:11,212 --> 00:28:12,098
What is this?

325
00:28:12,721 --> 00:28:14,370
How is it that the footage has gone

326
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:15,855
blank exactly at the time
of Roshan's murder?

327
00:28:16,007 --> 00:28:18,180
There was power cut yesterday.

328
00:28:18,332 --> 00:28:21,010
CCTV doesn't work
if there is power cut.

329
00:28:22,698 --> 00:28:23,736
Do you believe this?!

330
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:27,887
Is it sir?! I didn't know.

331
00:28:28,897 --> 00:28:29,734
Go further.

332
00:28:30,323 --> 00:28:31,478
How many guests
were there yesterday?

333
00:28:31,558 --> 00:28:32,426
Five.

334
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:33,789
Show their footages.

335
00:28:39,096 --> 00:28:41,365
Who is this person?
He is taking selfies everywhere.

336
00:28:42,064 --> 00:28:43,012
Guest.

337
00:28:43,185 --> 00:28:46,202
Name?
- Makali Bhujanga Gowda.

338
00:28:46,367 --> 00:28:48,436
It was the name given by my family.

339
00:28:48,776 --> 00:28:51,688
But everyone call me Bro.

340
00:28:52,623 --> 00:28:53,972
Why?

341
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:57,860
Need a cool name for FB, Insta page.

342
00:28:58,081 --> 00:28:59,804
So I call myself Bro.

343
00:29:00,302 --> 00:29:01,983
What is that Insta?

344
00:29:02,063 --> 00:29:04,488
Insta... Don't you know Instagram?

345
00:29:07,242 --> 00:29:08,882
What do you do in it?

346
00:29:09,151 --> 00:29:11,006
Photo blogger.

347
00:29:11,086 --> 00:29:13,932
Take a photo shoot
with a model every week.

348
00:29:14,012 --> 00:29:16,631
And then upload it in Insta page.

349
00:29:16,991 --> 00:29:18,423
What is the use of it?

350
00:29:18,749 --> 00:29:21,752
Fame. Likes, followers.

351
00:29:22,008 --> 00:29:23,316
Do you know one thing?

352
00:29:23,516 --> 00:29:26,561
I have hundred thousand of followers
for my Insta page.

353
00:29:26,641 --> 00:29:27,674
Super.

354
00:29:27,812 --> 00:29:32,953
Many girls follow me
to take a selfie with me.

355
00:29:33,652 --> 00:29:35,776
Then you are one
sort of celebrity.

356
00:29:35,856 --> 00:29:38,627
You build up and
show off in your area.

357
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:39,997
Very good...

358
00:29:40,537 --> 00:29:44,149
But no one knows me in my area.

359
00:29:44,229 --> 00:29:46,183
Then what sort of
a celebrity are you?

360
00:29:47,366 --> 00:29:50,244
Bro, this is online matter.

361
00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:52,922
It is difficult for me
to explain about this to you.

362
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,234
Oh! Online?

363
00:29:55,314 --> 00:29:58,036
Our cyber crime branch was
saying that there is a terrorist,

364
00:29:58,116 --> 00:30:00,187
who looks like a kid lost in a fair,

365
00:30:00,267 --> 00:30:03,924
but applies make up and
posts fake messages in Facebook.

366
00:30:04,004 --> 00:30:05,432
He must be that terrorist.

367
00:30:06,206 --> 00:30:08,578
No, bro!
- Get up.

368
00:30:09,746 --> 00:30:12,263
Do I look so cheap?
Call me sir.

369
00:30:12,764 --> 00:30:13,897
Shivaji sir.

370
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:15,030
Okay bro.
- Hey!

371
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:15,947
Sorry sir.

372
00:30:17,132 --> 00:30:18,265
What are you hiding?

373
00:30:19,333 --> 00:30:20,428
What is that?

374
00:30:21,547 --> 00:30:23,104
What is this?
- Nothing.

375
00:30:23,344 --> 00:30:25,022
I got it in the forest.

376
00:30:30,272 --> 00:30:31,544
Why did you go to forest?

377
00:30:31,846 --> 00:30:33,395
It seems there is something
queer in this place.

378
00:30:33,585 --> 00:30:36,151
So madam from
the site brought me here

379
00:30:36,231 --> 00:30:38,229
to take photos for a documentary.

380
00:30:38,463 --> 00:30:44,171
Unmarried bachelors here go missing
suddenly since last 5 years...

381
00:30:44,811 --> 00:30:47,095
Under very mysterious circumstances.

382
00:30:47,175 --> 00:30:48,305
What do you mean by mysterious?

383
00:30:48,573 --> 00:30:51,609
They say black magic
practices are increasing.

384
00:30:51,903 --> 00:30:52,820
Hearsay...

385
00:30:53,408 --> 00:30:54,990
Have you seen it personally?

386
00:30:55,362 --> 00:30:56,478
No sir.

387
00:30:56,789 --> 00:30:59,928
Actually I am not
well since I came here.

388
00:31:00,187 --> 00:31:01,485
A sort of...

389
00:31:01,822 --> 00:31:03,180
Sorry sir. Acidity.

390
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:06,366
So... You say that you were inside
the room yesterday night

391
00:31:06,446 --> 00:31:07,834
and did not go out.

392
00:31:07,914 --> 00:31:09,910
Yes sir. I was sleeping.

393
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:14,511
Sir, I think we can make her talk if
we call our constable Saroja here.

394
00:31:16,261 --> 00:31:17,098
Sir, coffee.

395
00:31:21,332 --> 00:31:22,865
I asked for coffee
and you have given.

396
00:31:22,945 --> 00:31:24,487
Why are you still standing here?
Get out!

397
00:31:29,199 --> 00:31:30,161
What is this?
- Sir!

398
00:31:30,534 --> 00:31:31,710
It is my personal diary.

399
00:31:32,395 --> 00:31:35,647
We are investigating a murder.
Nothing is personal here.

400
00:31:35,807 --> 00:31:37,057
You have been staying
in this resort since 3 days

401
00:31:37,137 --> 00:31:38,858
and Roshan stayed in the
room beneath this floor.

402
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:40,305
But you say that you
did not see him at all.

403
00:31:40,699 --> 00:31:44,158
I was sleeping.
I had this terrible nightmare.

404
00:31:44,296 --> 00:31:46,310
Bad dream.

405
00:31:46,497 --> 00:31:50,053
Dreamt as if a woman
is following me near the well.

406
00:31:50,219 --> 00:31:52,530
Felt she was looking at me.
Calling my name.

407
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:54,419
'Surekha!'

408
00:31:58,467 --> 00:32:01,172
Just weird sir.
Something is not right.

409
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:04,660
And something about this place...
- Sir.

410
00:32:05,208 --> 00:32:07,431
I feel this madam and Bro
are the killers.

411
00:32:08,036 --> 00:32:09,679
They are just pretending
about documentary.

412
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:12,525
Sir!
- Wait. What is that about well?

413
00:32:25,609 --> 00:32:28,474
What sort of a hotel is this?
Very shabby!

414
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:30,829
I told you to book a hotel
in another place.

415
00:32:30,909 --> 00:32:31,913
And we will get a good hotel.

416
00:32:31,993 --> 00:32:33,864
He didn't listen to me.
- Hello. What happened?

417
00:32:33,944 --> 00:32:35,138
Who are you?
- Madam!

418
00:32:35,346 --> 00:32:36,266
Who am I?!
- Yes.

419
00:32:36,346 --> 00:32:38,319
He is from police department.

420
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:40,159
Has come for investigation.
Please madam.

421
00:32:40,239 --> 00:32:42,720
ACP Shivaji Surathkal, crime branch.

422
00:32:43,538 --> 00:32:45,182
I am so sorry sir.

423
00:32:45,436 --> 00:32:47,838
Sir, please go and
look at the balcony sir.

424
00:32:48,026 --> 00:32:50,207
Disgusting. Please go.

425
00:32:51,508 --> 00:32:55,313
Wait. Where are you going?
Clean it. It is so dirty...

426
00:33:35,916 --> 00:33:38,634
Bhat! Room No 1005. Come fast.
- Okay.

427
00:33:41,391 --> 00:33:43,389
Sir, did you see that?

428
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,525
Such things are
happening frequently.

429
00:33:45,837 --> 00:33:48,682
This resort and this place...
Not alright.

430
00:33:48,855 --> 00:33:50,626
I can't sleep at night.

431
00:33:50,706 --> 00:33:53,048
Feel like someone
is knocking the door.

432
00:33:53,269 --> 00:33:55,518
But no one is there
if I open and see.

433
00:33:58,521 --> 00:34:00,458
If such things had
happened in San Diego,

434
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:02,416
they would have cancelled
the hotel license.

435
00:34:02,496 --> 00:34:04,145
It will affect every living being,
you know.

436
00:34:04,225 --> 00:34:07,376
Mister! Why are you silent?

437
00:34:07,702 --> 00:34:08,781
Any problem?

438
00:34:09,082 --> 00:34:11,244
Sir, he doesn't know Kannada.

439
00:34:11,324 --> 00:34:12,487
Doesn't know?
- Yes.

440
00:34:12,567 --> 00:34:13,459
Why?

441
00:34:13,539 --> 00:34:16,924
Sir, I will write a negative
review about this hotel.

442
00:34:17,004 --> 00:34:19,714
This place is haunted. It is scary.

443
00:34:19,794 --> 00:34:22,399
Soukhya! Don't exaggerate.

444
00:34:22,479 --> 00:34:25,331
No Som. I can't stay here
any longer. Let us get back.

445
00:34:26,057 --> 00:34:28,376
Sir, can we leave this hotel?

446
00:34:28,873 --> 00:34:31,696
Hello! A murder investigation
is going on here.

447
00:34:31,934 --> 00:34:34,021
Nobody is allowed
to leave this place.

448
00:34:34,101 --> 00:34:36,207
And trust me madam,
If you are genuine,

449
00:34:36,634 --> 00:34:37,973
you will definitely fly back home.

450
00:34:42,661 --> 00:34:44,188
Sir, he doesn't know Kannada.

451
00:34:44,769 --> 00:34:46,253
I feel he is the killer.

452
00:34:48,478 --> 00:34:50,166
I have to do all the work here.

453
00:34:51,254 --> 00:34:52,479
Are you Bhat?

454
00:34:53,837 --> 00:34:54,667
Yes sir.

455
00:34:54,747 --> 00:34:56,334
People are scared
to come to this resort.

456
00:34:56,414 --> 00:34:58,562
But you have been working
here since long. Why this loyalty?

457
00:34:59,108 --> 00:35:03,121
Sir, I am single.
I had two daughters.

458
00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:04,594
2nd daughter died.

459
00:35:04,803 --> 00:35:06,283
Have taken lot of loan.

460
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,805
Owner pays me salary in time.

461
00:35:09,998 --> 00:35:11,680
So I work here.

462
00:35:12,274 --> 00:35:16,045
Few pigeons have died and
fallen in that room balcony.

463
00:35:17,201 --> 00:35:19,865
Not few. Look here.

464
00:35:29,587 --> 00:35:32,312
Bad time for me on full moon days.

465
00:35:32,632 --> 00:35:34,163
Pigeons die in lots here.

466
00:35:34,243 --> 00:35:36,498
I bury them here.
What else can I do?

467
00:35:36,749 --> 00:35:38,055
It is so strange!

468
00:35:38,384 --> 00:35:42,103
Weird incidents happen
in Ranagiri often.

469
00:35:42,475 --> 00:35:45,139
Cannot find reasons
for some of the incidents.

470
00:35:46,705 --> 00:35:50,121
Even if there is a reason,
you will not tell. Right?

471
00:35:50,471 --> 00:35:51,301
That...

472
00:36:04,392 --> 00:36:06,086
Wait!
- Why?

473
00:36:06,166 --> 00:36:07,804
Sir, please don't lift it.

474
00:36:08,009 --> 00:36:10,216
This is a well.
There is some problem with this.

475
00:36:10,296 --> 00:36:11,613
Please sir.
- What problem?

476
00:36:11,693 --> 00:36:14,022
'Ji!'
- Problems are not few...

477
00:36:19,601 --> 00:36:21,428
Why this thread?
All of you have tied it.

478
00:36:22,038 --> 00:36:25,813
This... Our guest
Vidyasagar tied this.

479
00:36:26,022 --> 00:36:28,978
I am able to sleep well
at night after he tied this to me.

480
00:36:35,124 --> 00:36:38,085
Why are you giving colorful
threads to everyone?

481
00:36:38,259 --> 00:36:40,452
It is not a colorful thread.
It is for protection.

482
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:41,704
Protection from whom?

483
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:44,728
I am a professional palm reader.

484
00:36:45,165 --> 00:36:50,471
The color of the thread depends
on the lines in their palms.

485
00:36:50,551 --> 00:36:52,699
We do not want to know its rules.

486
00:36:52,949 --> 00:36:55,253
It is not a rule. It is a fact.

487
00:36:55,591 --> 00:36:59,757
There is close connection between
your life and the lines in palm.

488
00:36:59,837 --> 00:37:04,378
Can predict a person's past,
present and future from this.

489
00:37:05,998 --> 00:37:09,436
You look at the palm
and predict a person's future.

490
00:37:09,955 --> 00:37:11,270
We are from department.

491
00:37:11,595 --> 00:37:14,327
We will know the full details
of a person by looking at his face.

492
00:37:14,407 --> 00:37:15,365
Do you know?

493
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:18,646
I think you do not believe my words.

494
00:37:19,269 --> 00:37:22,071
Tell me your birth date.
Say. No problem.

495
00:37:22,151 --> 00:37:23,509
10th January.

496
00:37:23,589 --> 00:37:26,000
1001.

497
00:37:27,073 --> 00:37:28,512
Reflective number.

498
00:37:30,284 --> 00:37:32,173
Show your hand.

499
00:37:37,328 --> 00:37:39,701
You are searching
for someone. But...

500
00:37:39,902 --> 00:37:41,617
We have come for investigation.

501
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:43,361
Where is the question of searching?

502
00:37:43,625 --> 00:37:44,953
Everyone knows the reason.

503
00:37:45,033 --> 00:37:47,216
I am not saying that.

504
00:37:47,296 --> 00:37:48,613
This is an old incident.

505
00:37:48,693 --> 00:37:51,540
You have not got the
person you are searching for.

506
00:37:51,934 --> 00:37:53,173
Path to the aquarium.

507
00:37:53,858 --> 00:37:55,760
'It was 2 O'clock in the afternoon.'

508
00:37:55,840 --> 00:38:00,189
'I started enquiring the
neighbors if they saw Janani.'

509
00:38:02,416 --> 00:38:03,523
Madam, greetings.

510
00:38:03,731 --> 00:38:05,004
I am Janani's husband.

511
00:38:05,398 --> 00:38:07,206
She is not there in the house.
Did you see her?

512
00:38:09,502 --> 00:38:11,684
Did you see? Today?

513
00:38:11,764 --> 00:38:13,473
Where did you see? Did she go out?

514
00:38:14,872 --> 00:38:16,132
Where did she go alone?
She doesn't go.

515
00:38:17,017 --> 00:38:18,083
Did she go with someone?

516
00:38:19,425 --> 00:38:20,532
With whom?

517
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:22,096
Did she go in a car?

518
00:38:23,589 --> 00:38:24,586
Which vehicle?

519
00:38:25,036 --> 00:38:29,487
Auto? Or Cab? Which vehicle?
At least... Which color was it?

520
00:38:29,567 --> 00:38:30,471
Red.

521
00:38:31,091 --> 00:38:33,215
Blue, yellow, green.

522
00:38:34,101 --> 00:38:35,367
Which color vehicle?

523
00:38:35,692 --> 00:38:36,633
Which color was it?

524
00:38:41,053 --> 00:38:42,022
White color vehicle?

525
00:38:43,645 --> 00:38:45,112
White color vehicle. Which one?

526
00:38:50,542 --> 00:38:51,433
Ambulance.

527
00:38:55,354 --> 00:39:02,123
A life-changing incident happened
in your life 3-4 years back.

528
00:39:03,467 --> 00:39:06,912
You are in extreme
sorrow because of that.

529
00:39:11,754 --> 00:39:17,078
1001. Two more days.
A trouble awaits you.

530
00:39:17,617 --> 00:39:20,384
But it will not
be because of humans.

531
00:39:20,811 --> 00:39:23,622
Believe me. Wear this red thread.

532
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:27,911
You will get peace of mind
and escape from the threat.

533
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:43,647
Govindu!
- Sir...

534
00:39:44,201 --> 00:39:47,197
Did you observe a
point about that palmist?

535
00:39:47,391 --> 00:39:49,654
We went to enquire him.

536
00:39:49,734 --> 00:39:53,321
But he provoked our feelings.

537
00:39:55,604 --> 00:39:57,839
He is playing some mind game.

538
00:39:58,656 --> 00:39:59,701
Understand?

539
00:39:59,781 --> 00:40:01,611
Sir, he is the killer.

540
00:40:01,901 --> 00:40:02,861
Confirm.

541
00:40:04,295 --> 00:40:05,769
Earlier you said Bhat is the killer.

542
00:40:05,849 --> 00:40:07,069
Before that you said
the girl is the killer.

543
00:40:07,149 --> 00:40:09,020
Sir, this is double confirm.

544
00:40:15,767 --> 00:40:16,618
Good coffee.

545
00:40:17,843 --> 00:40:18,867
Why did you bring it?

546
00:40:19,446 --> 00:40:21,366
Sit down. Please sit.

547
00:40:21,446 --> 00:40:22,672
Thank you.

548
00:40:23,321 --> 00:40:24,229
Is it okay?

549
00:40:25,197 --> 00:40:28,536
Madam, you have to
tell us whatever you know.

550
00:40:28,787 --> 00:40:32,272
Should not lie. We cannot show you
'Bhagwat Gita' to take oath.

551
00:40:32,352 --> 00:40:33,475
Understand?

552
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:36,510
Mr Govindu!
- Yes sir.

553
00:40:36,675 --> 00:40:39,096
I had told Rudresh to get my tablet.

554
00:40:39,303 --> 00:40:40,895
Enquire him about that.
- Okay sir.

555
00:40:41,162 --> 00:40:43,351
Go and call from a distance.

556
00:40:44,527 --> 00:40:45,738
Alright sir.

557
00:40:49,561 --> 00:40:51,896
Why are you doing
work in this condition?

558
00:40:52,233 --> 00:40:53,954
You can go to your
mother's place and relax.

559
00:40:54,741 --> 00:40:57,275
Sir, we have staff problem.

560
00:40:57,681 --> 00:41:00,258
Pritam will be left alone.
That is why.

561
00:41:00,604 --> 00:41:01,530
Alright.

562
00:41:04,419 --> 00:41:05,785
What exactly happened yesterday?

563
00:41:06,179 --> 00:41:08,338
Anything unusual?

564
00:41:09,162 --> 00:41:11,149
Did anything strange happen?
Did you observe anything?

565
00:41:11,344 --> 00:41:13,237
Do not hesitate
because I am a police.

566
00:41:13,629 --> 00:41:16,375
Tell me honestly. Please.

567
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:21,141
I was in reception yesterday night.

568
00:41:21,268 --> 00:41:23,083
Got a call from Roshan's room.

569
00:41:32,704 --> 00:41:33,613
Hello!

570
00:41:33,789 --> 00:41:34,642
Hello!

571
00:41:43,218 --> 00:41:44,214
Pritam!

572
00:41:55,798 --> 00:41:58,190
'Smita!'

573
00:42:01,913 --> 00:42:06,626
So... You say that
Roshan ran out of the room.

574
00:42:07,113 --> 00:42:08,346
Why did he run?

575
00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:11,513
Did you see from whom he ran away?

576
00:42:12,781 --> 00:42:15,200
No. I didn't see anyone.

577
00:42:15,511 --> 00:42:19,119
According to Smita no one was seen.

578
00:42:20,727 --> 00:42:22,565
Not seen means...

579
00:42:22,886 --> 00:42:26,219
What is it mean?
Think. Just think...

580
00:42:26,299 --> 00:42:27,484
Think like Roshan.

581
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,920
You are very scared.
Came running out of the room.

582
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,058
What will he do first?

583
00:42:31,273 --> 00:42:32,352
Will call my girlfriend.

584
00:42:32,432 --> 00:42:34,421
Exactly.
He must have done the same thing.

585
00:42:34,501 --> 00:42:36,047
Hello! Darling!

586
00:42:37,009 --> 00:42:40,032
He was going this side. Why did
he turn and walk towards the pool?

587
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:44,286
He saw someone there.
Got scared and ran.

588
00:42:45,276 --> 00:42:46,348
Sir...

589
00:42:48,056 --> 00:42:48,965
No problem.

590
00:42:49,437 --> 00:42:52,758
He must also have dashed
against the pillar just as me.

591
00:42:53,622 --> 00:42:55,283
Yes. A mark in the watch.

592
00:42:55,363 --> 00:42:56,286
Was there a mark in the watch?

593
00:42:56,366 --> 00:42:57,968
Thank God! You did not ask what?

594
00:42:58,048 --> 00:43:00,313
Watch was there and there
was a mark in it. The reason was...

595
00:43:01,475 --> 00:43:03,489
This Pillar.
Look there! There is a mark.

596
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:05,067
You are a genius sir.

597
00:43:05,147 --> 00:43:07,682
I know...

598
00:43:07,862 --> 00:43:09,294
Who scared Roshan?

599
00:43:10,297 --> 00:43:11,916
Who is that...?

600
00:43:11,996 --> 00:43:13,701
That is the only missing link.

601
00:43:44,089 --> 00:43:46,697
Post mortem report
says death was by drowning.

602
00:43:47,236 --> 00:43:49,944
An expert swimmer
cannot drown unless...

603
00:43:50,024 --> 00:43:54,746
The Killer must have pushed
him down in water and killed him.

604
00:43:54,826 --> 00:43:56,012
Exactly.

605
00:43:56,092 --> 00:43:58,429
But Smita says

606
00:43:58,509 --> 00:44:02,765
that she saw only Roshan
and not anyone else.

607
00:44:02,918 --> 00:44:06,287
Which means we have
a mysterious killer.

608
00:44:06,367 --> 00:44:08,231
That person brought
Roshan out of the room,

609
00:44:08,311 --> 00:44:12,742
forcibly drowned him in
swimming pool and killed him.

610
00:44:13,751 --> 00:44:16,664
But nobody could see the killer.

611
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:18,545
A bull killer!

612
00:44:19,597 --> 00:44:20,558
Who is that killer?

613
00:47:28,161 --> 00:47:30,939
'Govindu and I roamed
the whole day.'

614
00:47:31,354 --> 00:47:33,610
'But did not get any
information about Janani.'

615
00:47:34,122 --> 00:47:37,298
'But the next day at
3 O'clock in the morning.'

616
00:47:39,235 --> 00:47:42,944
Sir, gas is getting wasted.
Petrol rate is high.

617
00:47:43,083 --> 00:47:46,002
Light it.
- Sir...!

618
00:47:46,210 --> 00:47:48,639
Sir no...
- Loafer! This is my wife's mobile.

619
00:47:48,719 --> 00:47:51,095
From where did you steal it?
- I will tell the truth.

620
00:47:51,175 --> 00:47:54,395
I was drinking tea in the shop.

621
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:57,253
A mobile fell from an ambulance.

622
00:48:02,595 --> 00:48:04,360
If Manja was telling the truth,

623
00:48:05,252 --> 00:48:07,148
who threw the mobile
from the ambulance?

624
00:48:07,681 --> 00:48:10,248
Whose ambulance was it?
Something is terribly wrong.

625
00:48:10,394 --> 00:48:12,912
Remember that incident properly.

626
00:48:13,058 --> 00:48:14,815
Tell me in detail about
whatever you saw there.

627
00:48:14,895 --> 00:48:16,760
Tell.
- Sir...

628
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:19,520
I do not remember anything else.

629
00:48:19,907 --> 00:48:21,215
Govindu!
- Sir!

630
00:48:21,962 --> 00:48:26,404
I think he doesn't know
why government has banned plastic!

631
00:48:31,710 --> 00:48:33,799
Sir! I will tell one thing.

632
00:48:33,879 --> 00:48:36,276
A dog died after getting
hit by the ambulance.

633
00:48:36,595 --> 00:48:37,626
What?

634
00:48:40,117 --> 00:48:41,812
This dog?

635
00:48:41,892 --> 00:48:44,463
I promise. I saw the same dog.

636
00:48:44,968 --> 00:48:46,047
Sir, it is our Gulma.

637
00:48:52,266 --> 00:48:54,376
'May 16th,
4 O'clock in the morning...'

638
00:48:55,712 --> 00:48:57,829
'As per Manja's information,'

639
00:48:58,265 --> 00:49:02,112
'I and Govinda went to
the place where the mobile fell.'

640
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:06,741
'We searched there
for some information.'

641
00:49:07,918 --> 00:49:08,942
'Then...'

642
00:49:34,675 --> 00:49:35,659
Sir!

643
00:49:39,281 --> 00:49:40,388
See here.

644
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:42,922
Our Gulma...

645
00:50:15,986 --> 00:50:20,042
'May 16th 5.30 a.m.'

646
00:50:20,647 --> 00:50:24,150
'I lost my dear friend Gulma.'

647
00:50:25,526 --> 00:50:26,641
'Forever.'

648
00:50:37,589 --> 00:50:40,657
'Good boy! Jump!'

649
00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:46,215
'Come on Gulma! Jump!'

650
00:50:48,796 --> 00:50:50,421
Sir, there is a fire.

651
00:50:51,053 --> 00:50:52,134
Fire! Where?

652
00:51:03,984 --> 00:51:05,956
Extinguish the fire!

653
00:51:06,036 --> 00:51:07,772
Spray with force.

654
00:51:09,006 --> 00:51:12,386
Extinguish the fire fully.

655
00:51:12,742 --> 00:51:14,479
Shivaji Surathkal.

656
00:51:14,887 --> 00:51:16,181
What is this?

657
00:51:16,707 --> 00:51:18,153
What have you thrown in it?

658
00:51:19,384 --> 00:51:20,817
How did the sofa catch fire?

659
00:51:21,149 --> 00:51:23,217
Don't know.
Caught fire automatically.

660
00:51:23,397 --> 00:51:24,719
How is it possible?

661
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:28,400
No wires for short circuit, no
kerosene nearby, no matchstick here.

662
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:29,783
How did it catch fire?

663
00:51:30,025 --> 00:51:32,488
Whose room is this?
That documentary girl?

664
00:51:32,568 --> 00:51:33,525
Yes sir.

665
00:51:33,706 --> 00:51:35,387
Where is she?
- Don't know.

666
00:51:35,670 --> 00:51:37,005
Saw fire from the window.

667
00:51:37,510 --> 00:51:40,714
Use our master key to
open the door and came inside.

668
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:43,745
What is this box?

669
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:46,837
Open it.
- No sir!

670
00:51:47,085 --> 00:51:48,988
It is cursed. Curse.

671
00:51:49,202 --> 00:51:50,081
No!

672
00:51:50,161 --> 00:51:51,679
You open it.
- Sir, no sir.

673
00:51:51,759 --> 00:51:52,794
Should not touch it sir.

674
00:51:53,015 --> 00:51:54,524
Open it.
- Sir! No!

675
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:55,801
No sir.

676
00:52:09,147 --> 00:52:10,617
Whose photo is this?

677
00:52:12,131 --> 00:52:14,683
Why are you staring at
each other's face? Who is this?

678
00:52:17,295 --> 00:52:18,273
Sir!
- Say.

679
00:52:18,353 --> 00:52:19,613
That is 'Moggine Jade' (Braid adorned
with flowers) Ranganayaki's photo.

680
00:52:19,693 --> 00:52:20,608
Who is she?

681
00:52:23,477 --> 00:52:27,196
'There is a reason for people
getting scared of Ranagiri.'

682
00:52:27,507 --> 00:52:29,972
'This is an old story.'

683
00:52:30,136 --> 00:52:32,800
'Many people who
practiced sorcery, '

684
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:35,431
'black magic,
human sacrifice lived here.'

685
00:52:35,645 --> 00:52:40,653
'People were scared of coming
out of their houses at night.'

686
00:52:40,826 --> 00:52:43,981
'It was Ranganayaki who made it an'

687
00:52:44,061 --> 00:52:45,998
'everlasting feeling
among the people.'

688
00:52:46,578 --> 00:52:48,411
'She grew up normally
like other kids.'

689
00:52:48,783 --> 00:52:53,817
'But nobody married
her since she was dumb.'

690
00:52:54,103 --> 00:52:59,189
'So she started doing sorcery
and started enticing boys.'

691
00:52:59,716 --> 00:53:04,239
'She sacrificed Pigeons
and drank its milk.'

692
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:08,288
'On full moon days,
she dressed up like a bride,'

693
00:53:08,486 --> 00:53:12,784
'wore anklets and
scared unmarried boys.'

694
00:53:13,121 --> 00:53:17,073
'Then she taunted them. Then she
killed them in a horrific way.'

695
00:53:17,523 --> 00:53:20,368
'Even now many boys who
travelled have gone missing.'

696
00:53:20,448 --> 00:53:22,729
'Ranganayaki is
responsible for that.'

697
00:53:24,458 --> 00:53:27,537
'Only day she killed Patel's son.'

698
00:53:28,254 --> 00:53:30,849
'As revenge,
he formed a group of men,'

699
00:53:31,125 --> 00:53:34,879
'chased her towards
the well and killed her.'

700
00:53:36,141 --> 00:53:38,839
'But the troubles did not end.'

701
00:53:39,306 --> 00:53:43,362
'From next full moon day
many boys went missing.'

702
00:53:44,236 --> 00:53:46,745
'People said Ranganayaki's
ghost is the cause for it.'

703
00:53:47,029 --> 00:53:49,641
'So they performed her final rites,'

704
00:53:49,831 --> 00:53:54,328
'put all her clothes
in a box and threw it.'

705
00:53:54,951 --> 00:53:57,113
We did not have any
trouble for few years.

706
00:53:57,408 --> 00:54:00,418
But someone opened
this trunk few years back.

707
00:54:00,659 --> 00:54:04,724
So bachelors go missing in Ranagiri.

708
00:54:05,217 --> 00:54:07,812
Now we saw that this trunk is here.

709
00:54:08,876 --> 00:54:10,779
Let us throw it at the earliest.
- Hey!

710
00:54:12,950 --> 00:54:15,077
This box is an important
evidence for this case.

711
00:54:15,665 --> 00:54:17,991
Keep it in my room.
- Sir, No!

712
00:54:18,225 --> 00:54:21,762
It is an act off ghost.
You will also be in trouble.

713
00:54:22,185 --> 00:54:24,451
Are you scaring me?

714
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:27,106
I am sending it to my room.
Not yours.

715
00:54:27,729 --> 00:54:30,215
I will be in trouble. Not you.
- No sir...

716
00:54:35,527 --> 00:54:38,706
Right. Let this matter be rested.

717
00:54:38,786 --> 00:54:41,949
First of all how did this
trunk appear in this room?

718
00:54:42,029 --> 00:54:43,767
That...
- Bro...

719
00:54:44,009 --> 00:54:46,007
Sorry sir. I know.

720
00:54:46,293 --> 00:54:50,133
Site madam brought this snake skin,
old trunk,

721
00:54:50,213 --> 00:54:53,647
cat's hair and many other
items for black magic documentary

722
00:54:53,727 --> 00:54:55,950
shoot and kept them in this room.

723
00:54:56,188 --> 00:54:57,885
It must be the effect of this.

724
00:54:57,965 --> 00:55:00,437
She used to walk
everywhere at night.

725
00:55:00,609 --> 00:55:04,988
When I ask,
she pleaded ignorance about it.

726
00:55:12,175 --> 00:55:14,718
You mean sleep walk?

727
00:55:14,798 --> 00:55:17,607
Yes sir. I told you sir.

728
00:55:17,884 --> 00:55:19,959
Look! She is standing there.

729
00:55:20,206 --> 00:55:23,936
Like the fishes that
sleep with eyes open!

730
00:55:24,595 --> 00:55:27,580
Sir, every day night

731
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:31,936
madam stands in the
balcony for a long time.

732
00:55:32,016 --> 00:55:33,871
I am seeing since 3 days.

733
00:55:34,455 --> 00:55:36,380
Roshan fell into the pool here.

734
00:55:36,888 --> 00:55:39,266
She is in the direct line of sight.

735
00:55:39,883 --> 00:55:42,661
That means I have an eye witness.

736
00:55:43,093 --> 00:55:45,288
But she is sleeping.

737
00:55:47,536 --> 00:55:49,418
I want you to relax, Surekha.

738
00:55:49,807 --> 00:55:51,547
This is a scientific procedure.

739
00:55:51,796 --> 00:55:56,304
I will help you to recollect
whatever happened in your sleep.

740
00:56:01,011 --> 00:56:02,957
See this.

741
00:56:04,497 --> 00:56:05,708
Focus.

742
00:56:06,279 --> 00:56:08,216
You are getting sleep.

743
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:10,906
Go to sleep.

744
00:56:15,014 --> 00:56:16,043
Good.

745
00:56:16,865 --> 00:56:20,749
Yesterday night you
were walking in sleep.

746
00:56:21,527 --> 00:56:23,300
You came to the end of corridor.

747
00:56:23,931 --> 00:56:25,125
What did you see there?

748
00:56:27,053 --> 00:56:28,653
Swimming pool.

749
00:56:29,467 --> 00:56:30,487
Good.

750
00:56:31,447 --> 00:56:33,402
Roshan came running
towards swimming pool.

751
00:56:33,558 --> 00:56:34,846
Yes.

752
00:56:35,712 --> 00:56:38,255
Someone followed him.
- Yes.

753
00:56:38,497 --> 00:56:42,207
Chased him,
drowned Roshan and killed him.

754
00:56:42,371 --> 00:56:43,772
Yes.

755
00:56:44,143 --> 00:56:46,539
Who was it? Who killed him?

756
00:56:47,482 --> 00:56:49,316
Was it a man or woman?

757
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:51,625
Where did the person
go after killing him?

758
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:53,182
To the well.

759
00:56:57,273 --> 00:56:58,241
Who was it?

760
00:57:18,703 --> 00:57:21,903
'Two more days.
A trouble awaits you.'

761
00:57:22,076 --> 00:57:26,989
'But it is not because
of humans 1001.'

762
00:57:41,635 --> 00:57:43,462
Saw your photos
in Roshan's Instagram.

763
00:57:43,711 --> 00:57:45,149
I think you were very close.

764
00:57:45,325 --> 00:57:47,824
We were to be engaged in 4 months.

765
00:57:49,112 --> 00:57:50,634
What happened to him?

766
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:54,682
Cannot say anything clearly for now.

767
00:57:55,270 --> 00:57:59,344
But the incidents happening here...

768
00:58:02,103 --> 00:58:03,331
What happened, sir?

769
00:58:04,438 --> 00:58:05,632
Did you hear the sound?

770
00:58:05,935 --> 00:58:07,621
'Shivaji!'
- What sort of sound?

771
00:58:08,312 --> 00:58:10,198
'Will you marry me?'

772
00:58:10,431 --> 00:58:12,273
Didn't hear any sound.

773
00:58:14,653 --> 00:58:16,495
Right. Leave that matter.

774
00:58:16,575 --> 00:58:18,889
You and Roshan wanted
to get married.

775
00:58:19,140 --> 00:58:20,472
Do you doubt anyone?

776
00:58:20,844 --> 00:58:23,983
I doubt someone after this incident.

777
00:58:24,287 --> 00:58:26,950
Why did Roshan come here?

778
00:58:27,192 --> 00:58:29,458
Something not right
about the place, sir.

779
00:58:29,693 --> 00:58:30,843
'Ji!'

780
00:58:31,838 --> 00:58:33,654
'Will you marry me?'

781
00:59:03,267 --> 00:59:05,092
Sir tea!

782
00:59:06,856 --> 00:59:08,205
I told you to order Coffee.

783
00:59:08,285 --> 00:59:10,722
Coffee powder is over.

784
00:59:11,059 --> 00:59:13,195
You give tea if we ask coffee.

785
00:59:13,275 --> 00:59:14,674
Get cold water in
place of hot water.

786
00:59:14,847 --> 00:59:17,536
Pigeons flying high
have fallen down.

787
00:59:17,692 --> 00:59:18,877
What is this nonsense?

788
00:59:19,992 --> 00:59:21,272
You may go. Thanks.

789
00:59:25,303 --> 00:59:26,237
Sir.

790
00:59:28,373 --> 00:59:31,712
Shall we throw all
this out as Bhat said?

791
00:59:32,005 --> 00:59:33,925
Why? Are you scared?

792
00:59:34,349 --> 00:59:37,247
Sir, you do not understand.

793
00:59:38,284 --> 00:59:39,426
What?

794
00:59:40,550 --> 00:59:42,833
Roshan was unmarried.
- Yes.

795
00:59:43,179 --> 00:59:45,125
Came out of the room alone.

796
00:59:45,497 --> 00:59:47,278
He went near the wretched well.

797
00:59:47,996 --> 00:59:49,293
It was a full moon day.

798
00:59:49,786 --> 00:59:51,697
Ranganayaki's ghost must have...

799
00:59:51,896 --> 00:59:56,671
So... Like them do you
also say that a ghost killed him?

800
00:59:57,475 --> 01:00:01,341
It is the truth.
Only you cannot see it.

801
01:00:01,608 --> 01:00:02,698
Really?

802
01:00:03,061 --> 01:00:04,393
Shall I tell one thing?
- Sir.

803
01:00:04,473 --> 01:00:07,628
Ghost, vampires, etc
are only our imagination.

804
01:00:08,138 --> 01:00:10,880
Fear has a thousand forms.
It is like that.

805
01:00:11,874 --> 01:00:15,524
You look for ghost
and vampires in Google.

806
01:00:15,940 --> 01:00:17,263
How can I explain to you?

807
01:00:18,089 --> 01:00:22,111
I will tell one thing
if you will not scold me.

808
01:00:22,191 --> 01:00:23,146
Tell.

809
01:00:23,996 --> 01:00:24,843
Sir.

810
01:00:25,659 --> 01:00:27,437
This place Ranagiri is not alright.

811
01:00:28,550 --> 01:00:29,934
Let us give up this case.

812
01:00:30,716 --> 01:00:32,535
Let us go back to our place.

813
01:00:32,715 --> 01:00:34,203
What nonsense are you talking?

814
01:00:34,376 --> 01:00:36,334
We work for department.
We should be practical.

815
01:00:36,414 --> 01:00:37,343
Who will believe us
if we talk about ghost?

816
01:00:37,423 --> 01:00:39,813
'Ji! Will you marry me?'

817
01:00:41,704 --> 01:00:43,905
Power is fluctuating.
Go and check the fuse.

818
01:00:52,892 --> 01:00:54,432
'Open the door.'

819
01:01:01,210 --> 01:01:03,882
'Follow me. Come.'

820
01:01:17,746 --> 01:01:20,550
'Follow me. Come to me.'

821
01:01:36,356 --> 01:01:37,705
'Shivaji!'

822
01:01:48,837 --> 01:01:50,074
You!

823
01:02:18,416 --> 01:02:23,450
'Ji! Will you marry me?'

824
01:02:26,985 --> 01:02:28,769
'Roshan killed me.'

825
01:03:41,887 --> 01:03:43,747
'What happened, Ji?'

826
01:03:46,331 --> 01:03:47,498
'Ji!'

827
01:07:35,929 --> 01:07:37,356
'Listen to me.'

828
01:07:39,027 --> 01:07:40,768
'Will you marry me?'

829
01:08:01,681 --> 01:08:03,811
'Ji! What shall we name our child?'

830
01:08:04,042 --> 01:08:05,313
'Two more days.'

831
01:08:05,393 --> 01:08:06,948
'You will be in trouble.
- Ji!'

832
01:08:07,028 --> 01:08:08,815
'You're not going well.
- You will be in trouble.'

833
01:08:09,041 --> 01:08:10,364
'But it will not
be because of humans'.

834
01:08:10,774 --> 01:08:12,755
'If she is dead...'

835
01:08:13,264 --> 01:08:15,129
'Shivaji...'

836
01:08:15,209 --> 01:08:17,215
'Where is murder the weapon?'

837
01:08:17,295 --> 01:08:19,230
'Invisible killer...'

838
01:08:20,773 --> 01:08:23,549
'1-2...
- Come on.'

839
01:08:23,629 --> 01:08:25,706
'Ji, you are perfectly alright.'

840
01:08:29,557 --> 01:08:30,586
Don't you have coffee?

841
01:08:30,915 --> 01:08:31,884
Will get in the afternoon.

842
01:08:32,082 --> 01:08:33,890
Please adjust.
Will give you in the afternoon.

843
01:08:34,844 --> 01:08:35,847
Sir.

844
01:08:36,455 --> 01:08:39,714
I do not drink tea or coffee.
My drink is different.

845
01:08:48,586 --> 01:08:50,064
Sir what happened?

846
01:08:50,895 --> 01:08:53,040
I saw her yesterday.

847
01:08:53,252 --> 01:08:54,262
Who?

848
01:08:55,188 --> 01:08:56,503
I saw her.

849
01:08:57,209 --> 01:08:58,115
Who?

850
01:08:58,966 --> 01:08:59,963
Ranganayaki.

851
01:09:00,043 --> 01:09:02,654
Sir, you saw...

852
01:09:02,896 --> 01:09:04,045
It was she.

853
01:09:05,214 --> 01:09:06,783
The incidents happening
here are because of her.

854
01:09:06,863 --> 01:09:08,735
The people here
are saying the truth.

855
01:09:10,076 --> 01:09:13,619
They said she will first scare us.

856
01:09:13,889 --> 01:09:15,640
Then she will turn us mad.

857
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:17,910
And finally she will kill.

858
01:09:18,215 --> 01:09:19,516
All that is happening to me.

859
01:09:20,077 --> 01:09:21,807
She scared me there.

860
01:09:22,056 --> 01:09:24,000
When I went near the well...

861
01:09:24,312 --> 01:09:28,484
'Moggine Jade' Ranganayaki
was standing there.

862
01:09:28,718 --> 01:09:32,094
I went near and saw. It was
not Ranganayaki. She was my Janani.

863
01:09:32,278 --> 01:09:34,527
My Janani.
She resembled Ranganayaki.

864
01:09:34,607 --> 01:09:36,907
She walked strangely
like Ranganayaki. - Sir...

865
01:09:36,987 --> 01:09:39,855
She is turning me mad.
Then she will kill me tomorrow.

866
01:09:39,935 --> 01:09:42,345
Sir you said...
- Just as she killed Roshan.

867
01:09:42,539 --> 01:09:44,421
We should leave this place

868
01:09:44,501 --> 01:09:45,645
Sir...
- as soon as possible.

869
01:09:45,725 --> 01:09:47,451
This place is dangerous.
- You said

870
01:09:47,531 --> 01:09:48,738
there are no ghosts or vampires.

871
01:09:48,818 --> 01:09:50,509
And we should be practical.
- Yeah.

872
01:09:50,689 --> 01:09:52,335
Listen...

873
01:09:54,412 --> 01:09:56,101
I am also rational. Okay?

874
01:09:56,350 --> 01:09:57,630
I told you.

875
01:09:58,696 --> 01:10:02,273
I told you yesterday evening.
But I experienced it at night.

876
01:10:02,944 --> 01:10:04,314
I saw her.

877
01:10:05,206 --> 01:10:06,832
I saw Ranganayaki.

878
01:10:06,912 --> 01:10:08,894
Listen to me.
- I saw her.

879
01:10:09,350 --> 01:10:10,852
It was dark yesterday night.

880
01:10:11,301 --> 01:10:13,529
You must have seen something else.

881
01:10:13,938 --> 01:10:17,162
You have not slept
properly since 2 days.

882
01:10:17,578 --> 01:10:21,667
And you have not taken tablets also.

883
01:10:22,144 --> 01:10:24,614
You are saying I am mad.
- No sir.

884
01:10:24,694 --> 01:10:26,621
You think I am imagining things.

885
01:10:26,701 --> 01:10:29,658
I am just imagining. Am I mad?
- I did not mean it sir.

886
01:10:29,990 --> 01:10:33,048
I am saying I saw
Ranganayaki standing there.

887
01:10:33,128 --> 01:10:35,082
No sir. - Do you say it is
only my imagination?

888
01:10:35,162 --> 01:10:36,854
I did not say so.
- Then what do you mean?

889
01:10:36,934 --> 01:10:39,116
I mean...
- Spirits and ghosts are there.

890
01:10:39,196 --> 01:10:41,482
Sir, I do not mean that.

891
01:10:42,084 --> 01:10:43,655
You had not taken tablets.

892
01:10:43,735 --> 01:10:45,115
Just shut up and go.

893
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,311
Bullshit! Go. Out!

894
01:11:35,825 --> 01:11:40,217
'Ji, are you unable to differentiate
between the truth and false?'

895
01:11:41,785 --> 01:11:44,325
Since yesterday everything...

896
01:11:50,830 --> 01:11:52,117
Hey!

897
01:11:56,019 --> 01:11:57,652
What is happening here?

898
01:11:58,047 --> 01:12:00,425
Sir, what happened?

899
01:12:01,101 --> 01:12:02,506
That...

900
01:12:03,912 --> 01:12:06,547
My hand slipped
and tea cup fell down.

901
01:12:07,271 --> 01:12:08,298
What happened?
- Look there.

902
01:12:08,378 --> 01:12:10,709
Your hand did not slip.
You have a problem.

903
01:12:10,789 --> 01:12:13,509
No! What problem?
I have no problems.

904
01:12:13,865 --> 01:12:16,613
Look! Your hand is shaking.
- No problem.

905
01:12:16,693 --> 01:12:19,407
You look so weak.
- No. I am perfectly okay.

906
01:12:19,487 --> 01:12:21,759
What is wrong with me?
- Your pupils are dilated.

907
01:12:22,002 --> 01:12:23,645
No problem.

908
01:12:24,985 --> 01:12:26,807
Why? Are you not getting sleep?

909
01:12:26,887 --> 01:12:29,084
No. I am perfectly okay.

910
01:12:35,079 --> 01:12:36,169
I am okay...

911
01:12:40,169 --> 01:12:44,245
They all are laughing.

912
01:12:44,498 --> 01:12:46,083
Let us go down and talk.

913
01:12:46,163 --> 01:12:48,234
Please...

914
01:12:48,797 --> 01:12:50,072
Please.

915
01:12:53,453 --> 01:12:56,061
I don't know what is happening here.
What sort of a person is he?

916
01:13:01,589 --> 01:13:04,771
I feel sad to hear about your wife.

917
01:13:06,336 --> 01:13:08,256
That is why you have
clinical depression.

918
01:13:09,104 --> 01:13:11,396
I do not have depression.

919
01:13:11,759 --> 01:13:16,282
Of course I cannot
sleep properly at night.

920
01:13:16,966 --> 01:13:19,431
I have anger issues since birth.

921
01:13:19,699 --> 01:13:21,265
But the incidents which happened
yesterday and day before...

922
01:13:21,740 --> 01:13:22,787
What happened?

923
01:13:23,471 --> 01:13:26,022
The Voice...
The Wretched well... Leave it.

924
01:13:26,102 --> 01:13:29,203
Being a psychiatrist,
I can see you have a problem.

925
01:13:29,283 --> 01:13:32,050
Like... You are seeing
things which others do not see.

926
01:13:32,682 --> 01:13:35,570
You are hearing things
which others do not hear.

927
01:13:36,695 --> 01:13:41,711
You think it is extraordinary
memory power or something else?

928
01:13:43,025 --> 01:13:46,069
Sir, your tea is
getting cold. Drink.

929
01:13:47,566 --> 01:13:49,676
Personally I feel you need a break.

930
01:13:49,875 --> 01:13:50,792
How can I take a break?

931
01:13:51,371 --> 01:13:53,464
You know this is a serious case.

932
01:13:54,018 --> 01:13:55,307
How can I leave it and go?

933
01:13:56,310 --> 01:13:59,147
But how will you solve
it when your mind is not clear?

934
01:13:59,415 --> 01:14:02,381
As a doctor, it is a personal
suggestion. Take a break.

935
01:14:02,995 --> 01:14:04,379
At least for a few hours.

936
01:14:05,331 --> 01:14:06,740
You will feel much better.

937
01:14:07,380 --> 01:14:08,643
You are right.

938
01:14:12,361 --> 01:14:15,855
Rudresh! Sir! Sir...

939
01:14:23,111 --> 01:14:25,887
How is it that you are
going to my mother's house?

940
01:14:26,406 --> 01:14:28,551
Is it because the new girl,
a doctor, told you?

941
01:14:28,631 --> 01:14:31,950
Come on Janu!
You also think like normal girls.

942
01:14:32,305 --> 01:14:33,412
Then why?

943
01:14:33,601 --> 01:14:35,565
You were avoiding my
family all these years.

944
01:14:35,868 --> 01:14:39,154
Why are you going there
suddenly now? What is the matter?

945
01:14:39,414 --> 01:14:42,121
Have you started? You are a lawyer.

946
01:14:42,337 --> 01:14:45,408
How can I argue with you? I don't
want to have this conversation.

947
01:14:47,016 --> 01:14:49,697
Okay. Shall we play music?
- Yes.

948
01:14:52,033 --> 01:14:54,386
Oh! Your favorite song.
- Yes.

949
01:15:05,911 --> 01:15:06,820
Ji!

950
01:15:11,162 --> 01:15:12,909
'Hello! Police control room?'

951
01:15:13,090 --> 01:15:18,115
'Bunty and his friend are
kidnapping in an ambulance.'

952
01:15:18,953 --> 01:15:20,813
'The Lawyer is wearing green shawl.'

953
01:15:21,134 --> 01:15:23,417
'Around 28-30 years old.'

954
01:15:23,590 --> 01:15:25,034
'She is pregnant.'

955
01:15:25,114 --> 01:15:27,482
'I cannot say more. Sorry.'

956
01:15:27,638 --> 01:15:30,181
'But the information is 100% true.'

957
01:15:30,431 --> 01:15:31,581
'I am really sorry.'

958
01:15:31,661 --> 01:15:32,957
Our additional branch...

959
01:15:33,112 --> 01:15:34,366
Some anonymous call.

960
01:15:34,446 --> 01:15:37,064
Can we consider it a
kidnap case on that basis?

961
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:38,569
We want proper evidence.

962
01:15:38,794 --> 01:15:41,017
You are emotional
because it is your wife.

963
01:15:41,830 --> 01:15:43,655
Do one thing.
Apply for one week's leave.

964
01:15:44,035 --> 01:15:45,376
Patil will handle this case.

965
01:15:45,652 --> 01:15:47,606
Patil!
- Thank you sir.

966
01:15:47,779 --> 01:15:48,860
But why sir?

967
01:15:49,103 --> 01:15:52,684
No buts. It is my order.
You can go now.

968
01:15:57,414 --> 01:16:00,994
'May 16th around 1 O'clock...'

969
01:16:01,427 --> 01:16:04,661
'I started off the
record investigation'

970
01:16:04,826 --> 01:16:09,616
'to collect information about
Bunty who kidnapped Janani.'

971
01:16:11,657 --> 01:16:13,214
This is Janani's number. Okay.

972
01:16:13,724 --> 01:16:16,699
Find out with whom she talked last.

973
01:16:16,779 --> 01:16:17,781
One minute sir.

974
01:16:26,542 --> 01:16:27,675
This number.

975
01:16:28,038 --> 01:16:29,197
He has called repeatedly.

976
01:16:30,322 --> 01:16:31,679
Check whether you can
get the call recordings.

977
01:16:31,759 --> 01:16:32,786
One minute sir.

978
01:16:35,139 --> 01:16:38,961
'Hello! Madam! Heard you have
taken up a new case yesterday.'

979
01:16:39,412 --> 01:16:41,167
'Got information from your office.'

980
01:16:41,247 --> 01:16:43,814
'Who are you?
Why are you bothered?'

981
01:16:43,996 --> 01:16:46,712
'Influential people
are involved in this.'

982
01:16:46,911 --> 01:16:49,523
'Better leave this case.
Let us come to a compromise.'

983
01:16:49,921 --> 01:16:52,230
'Will come to your house
if you need settlement.'

984
01:16:52,421 --> 01:16:55,292
'What do you say?
- Settlement! My foot! Hang up.'

985
01:16:55,551 --> 01:16:58,700
Bastard! How dare he threaten her?

986
01:16:58,994 --> 01:17:01,398
Just find who he is.
It must be Bunty. Check.

987
01:17:03,423 --> 01:17:06,831
No sir. His name is Peter Tom.
No.33, BB Mohalla, Mysore.

988
01:17:20,937 --> 01:17:23,756
Why?
Why did you threaten my wife?

989
01:17:24,872 --> 01:17:27,153
Tell me. Who is Bunty?
- Leave me.

990
01:17:27,233 --> 01:17:28,915
What is your relationship with him?
Tell me.

991
01:17:29,666 --> 01:17:32,243
Will pull out your ears. Tell.
- I did not call anyone.

992
01:17:32,412 --> 01:17:34,682
Sir, leave him.
- Who is Bunty?

993
01:17:34,762 --> 01:17:37,461
We do not have warrant. He may die.

994
01:17:37,541 --> 01:17:40,250
Sir, lost my phone 2 weeks back.

995
01:17:40,330 --> 01:17:42,304
Then why did you run on seeing us?

996
01:17:42,384 --> 01:17:43,904
I am scared of police.

997
01:17:43,984 --> 01:17:46,477
Sir, Leave him.
He is not the person.

998
01:17:46,975 --> 01:17:48,629
Get lost!

999
01:17:48,958 --> 01:17:50,143
Get lost!
- Idiot.

1000
01:17:50,307 --> 01:17:51,163
Go!

1001
01:17:56,162 --> 01:17:58,843
'Dummy ambulance
was used to kidnap.'

1002
01:17:59,094 --> 01:18:02,294
'Janani got threatening
call from a stolen phone.'

1003
01:18:03,419 --> 01:18:07,086
'Not even a small
clue from CCTV footages.'

1004
01:18:07,337 --> 01:18:08,988
'Looks like someone who is aware '

1005
01:18:09,068 --> 01:18:11,081
'of police procedures
must have done this.'

1006
01:18:11,323 --> 01:18:15,085
Is it?! Do you mean to say that
there is a mole in our department?

1007
01:18:15,250 --> 01:18:18,182
I mean why it should not
be a person from our department?

1008
01:18:19,661 --> 01:18:21,243
Cannot believe anyone.

1009
01:18:22,126 --> 01:18:25,481
Now we should leave our
regular police investigation route

1010
01:18:25,561 --> 01:18:27,124
and use some other network.

1011
01:18:27,877 --> 01:18:28,967
How?

1012
01:18:29,564 --> 01:18:30,895
Informer network.

1013
01:18:59,993 --> 01:19:01,074
It must be here.

1014
01:19:01,229 --> 01:19:03,002
The ambulance in which Janani
was kidnapped must be here.

1015
01:19:03,331 --> 01:19:05,164
Aslam Bhai's information
has never been wrong.

1016
01:19:05,467 --> 01:19:07,914
Sir, all are of white color.

1017
01:19:08,415 --> 01:19:10,240
How can we search from this?

1018
01:19:44,263 --> 01:19:45,550
Sir!

1019
01:19:52,803 --> 01:19:54,305
Govindu! Are you okay?

1020
01:19:54,608 --> 01:19:55,970
The car has gone!
- You are alright?

1021
01:19:56,629 --> 01:19:59,976
It was aimed at me.
- Forget it.

1022
01:20:00,056 --> 01:20:02,994
Bunty has escaped. Do not leave him.

1023
01:20:03,384 --> 01:20:04,888
We can find out madam.

1024
01:20:07,611 --> 01:20:09,573
It is sticking here.
- Where?

1025
01:20:09,788 --> 01:20:12,597
Here. Something sticky here.

1026
01:20:27,943 --> 01:20:29,402
Govindu!
- Sir!

1027
01:20:29,622 --> 01:20:30,800
You are a genius.

1028
01:20:55,601 --> 01:20:59,049
'May 16th , 3.30 p.m.'

1029
01:20:59,590 --> 01:21:01,838
'could find the ambulance in which
Janani was kidnapped'

1030
01:21:02,206 --> 01:21:03,979
'but not Janani.'

1031
01:21:23,779 --> 01:21:27,464
Janani always used to say
that you like this dish very much.

1032
01:21:30,828 --> 01:21:33,059
When did I come here?

1033
01:21:33,423 --> 01:21:36,493
You came early in the
morning and slept off.

1034
01:21:36,573 --> 01:21:38,361
I did not try to wake you up.

1035
01:21:39,226 --> 01:21:40,895
Did I drive the car?

1036
01:21:41,241 --> 01:21:43,014
Yes. Why?

1037
01:21:45,817 --> 01:21:47,832
Excuse me. Just...

1038
01:21:48,369 --> 01:21:49,649
Hello!
- Sir,

1039
01:21:49,934 --> 01:21:51,153
could get hold of
the missing driver.

1040
01:21:51,233 --> 01:21:52,862
Is it? Excellent.

1041
01:21:52,942 --> 01:21:54,544
I will come there right now.
- Okay sir.

1042
01:21:54,624 --> 01:21:55,658
Hold him.
- Okay sir.

1043
01:21:55,941 --> 01:21:59,200
Eat breakfast and go.
- No. I have to go now. Please.

1044
01:21:59,365 --> 01:22:01,697
You are coming here
after many years.

1045
01:22:01,912 --> 01:22:03,475
Why are you in a hurry to go?

1046
01:22:03,555 --> 01:22:05,848
I came to Madikeri for a case.

1047
01:22:05,928 --> 01:22:07,302
Have some urgent work.

1048
01:22:07,382 --> 01:22:08,969
Will come some other day.
- I will pack it.

1049
01:22:09,049 --> 01:22:10,664
No. Excuse me. No.
Thanks. Please.

1050
01:22:11,114 --> 01:22:13,197
Shiva! Shiva!

1051
01:22:14,408 --> 01:22:15,418
Sorry. Bye.

1052
01:22:26,015 --> 01:22:27,404
Sir, he is the missing driver.

1053
01:22:27,640 --> 01:22:28,972
His name is Anwar. Right?
- Yes sir.

1054
01:22:29,281 --> 01:22:31,308
Hey! He!

1055
01:22:34,473 --> 01:22:35,597
How dare you?
- Sir...

1056
01:22:35,677 --> 01:22:37,488
Sir... What are you doing?

1057
01:22:37,568 --> 01:22:40,034
He has come here right
after meeting with an accident.

1058
01:22:40,172 --> 01:22:42,912
His pulse rate is very bad.

1059
01:22:43,147 --> 01:22:45,624
You please calm down.
- I will calm down, madam.

1060
01:22:45,704 --> 01:22:48,142
I am investigating
an important case.

1061
01:22:48,222 --> 01:22:50,618
Are you playing tricks with me?
- Sir...

1062
01:22:50,698 --> 01:22:52,743
Your boss was murdered 2 days back.

1063
01:22:52,823 --> 01:22:55,220
Where did you go? Where did you go?

1064
01:22:55,300 --> 01:22:57,247
Sir...

1065
01:22:57,327 --> 01:22:58,803
Stop that drama.

1066
01:22:58,883 --> 01:23:00,616
Sir! Just a minute.
- Shut up.

1067
01:23:00,754 --> 01:23:03,217
I told you not to speak harshly
since he is an accident victim.

1068
01:23:03,297 --> 01:23:04,123
Look what happened now!

1069
01:23:04,203 --> 01:23:06,019
If he is an accident victim he
should have been taken to hospital.

1070
01:23:06,099 --> 01:23:08,054
Who brought him here?
- I brought him.

1071
01:23:09,299 --> 01:23:10,399
Why did you bring him?

1072
01:23:10,479 --> 01:23:13,755
I have to follow
senior officer instruction.

1073
01:23:13,835 --> 01:23:16,468
Who is that senior officer?
- You!

1074
01:23:17,257 --> 01:23:19,609
He came from the right
side and hit the trunk.

1075
01:23:19,689 --> 01:23:22,951
Idiot! Diffuse that spot.
No need to go to hospital.

1076
01:23:23,089 --> 01:23:25,995
You will be in problem if my
vehicle no. is mentioned in FIR.

1077
01:23:26,075 --> 01:23:27,730
Delete his mobile recordings.

1078
01:23:27,810 --> 01:23:28,886
He is driver Anwar.

1079
01:23:29,031 --> 01:23:33,189
I don't care. Clear the crowd.
- Hey! Disperse... Go!

1080
01:23:33,269 --> 01:23:36,808
What are you blabbering?
Have you gone crazy?

1081
01:23:37,383 --> 01:23:39,894
When did I say? Why are you lying?

1082
01:23:39,974 --> 01:23:42,122
Sir, please... He may be lying.

1083
01:23:42,202 --> 01:23:43,761
But you can tell the truth.

1084
01:23:43,841 --> 01:23:45,630
You know the truth.

1085
01:23:45,976 --> 01:23:48,398
You advised me to take a break.
I said okay.

1086
01:23:48,478 --> 01:23:50,640
So I went with my wife
to my In-law's place.

1087
01:23:50,720 --> 01:23:53,048
When I was enjoying
my trip with my wife,

1088
01:23:53,128 --> 01:23:54,875
this idiot dashed against the car.

1089
01:23:55,159 --> 01:23:56,301
With wife?

1090
01:23:56,867 --> 01:23:58,424
Oh! With wife!

1091
01:23:58,639 --> 01:24:01,946
Oh! With wife!

1092
01:24:02,686 --> 01:24:06,333
Today morning he was saying
that his wife died 4 years back.

1093
01:24:06,734 --> 01:24:07,695
But now...

1094
01:24:07,896 --> 01:24:09,660
You are imagining things, sir.
- Anjali!

1095
01:24:09,740 --> 01:24:12,497
Miss Anjali, I shared my past

1096
01:24:12,577 --> 01:24:14,496
and feelings with you
since you are a doctor.

1097
01:24:14,718 --> 01:24:17,008
You do not twist it and
fabricate a new story. Okay?

1098
01:24:17,088 --> 01:24:20,065
Please do not manipulate. No...
- No... You are hallucinating.

1099
01:24:20,145 --> 01:24:21,809
No...
- You seem to have memory issue.

1100
01:24:21,889 --> 01:24:25,713
I don't have any problems
and my memory is perfect.

1101
01:24:26,090 --> 01:24:27,999
Oh! Really?
- Yes.

1102
01:24:28,586 --> 01:24:30,941
Okay. You were travelling happily

1103
01:24:31,021 --> 01:24:32,764
and there was an accident.
- Yes.

1104
01:24:32,844 --> 01:24:34,604
Then what happened yesterday night?

1105
01:24:34,785 --> 01:24:36,420
Yesterday night we were talking

1106
01:24:36,500 --> 01:24:38,348
about the suspect in your
boyfriend Roshan's murder.

1107
01:24:38,428 --> 01:24:40,289
Power went off.
- Sir, I will go and check.

1108
01:24:40,898 --> 01:24:43,116
Govind went that side
and I went the other side.

1109
01:24:43,196 --> 01:24:46,342
When I went near the pool, that boy
Makaligowda, he fell into the pool.

1110
01:24:46,422 --> 01:24:47,846
I stretched my hand to save him.

1111
01:24:47,926 --> 01:24:50,306
Hello!
When did I fall into the pool?

1112
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:53,650
You have also become
a psyche like our madam here.

1113
01:24:54,393 --> 01:24:56,063
Didn't you fall into the water?
- No.

1114
01:24:56,143 --> 01:24:58,024
Do not lie.
- Why should I tell lie, Bro?

1115
01:24:58,104 --> 01:24:59,366
Do not call me Bro.

1116
01:24:59,446 --> 01:25:01,476
I have told you many times
not to address me like that.

1117
01:25:01,556 --> 01:25:03,272
Call me Shivaji.
- Leave him.

1118
01:25:03,352 --> 01:25:05,753
You killed the minister's
son and are trying to frame me.

1119
01:25:05,833 --> 01:25:07,521
Sir!
- Why are you beating me?

1120
01:25:07,601 --> 01:25:10,040
I am Shivaji...
- Sir!

1121
01:25:10,120 --> 01:25:12,055
Surathkal! I am sure.

1122
01:25:12,460 --> 01:25:15,725
Loafer! Bengali Tiger!
How dare you record this?

1123
01:25:15,805 --> 01:25:16,903
Get out of my sight.

1124
01:25:16,983 --> 01:25:18,567
What's happening?
What is happening here?

1125
01:25:18,647 --> 01:25:21,140
Keep quiet. Why are you interfering?
- Stop.

1126
01:25:21,550 --> 01:25:24,419
He says he was hypnotized.

1127
01:25:24,499 --> 01:25:26,419
That boy fell in
pool yesterday night.

1128
01:25:26,499 --> 01:25:27,831
You are not mentally stable sir.

1129
01:25:27,911 --> 01:25:29,680
You are not fit to
investigate this case.

1130
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:32,328
You have a problem.
- I have no problems.

1131
01:25:32,408 --> 01:25:33,697
You have a problem.

1132
01:25:33,777 --> 01:25:36,521
I don't have any problem.
- Sir, please...

1133
01:25:38,213 --> 01:25:42,251
I will give you just one hour time.

1134
01:25:42,331 --> 01:25:45,742
Get out of here otherwise...

1135
01:25:46,206 --> 01:25:49,968
You have a problem.

1136
01:25:50,643 --> 01:25:53,159
You have become a psyche.

1137
01:25:53,239 --> 01:25:55,590
Ranganayaki scares...

1138
01:25:56,395 --> 01:25:58,176
Makes people crazy...

1139
01:25:58,349 --> 01:26:00,503
Kills.

1140
01:26:00,988 --> 01:26:04,101
It is a bad time for you, sir.

1141
01:26:07,630 --> 01:26:09,014
Govindu!
- Sir...

1142
01:26:10,164 --> 01:26:11,972
Pack the bags.
- Alright sir.

1143
01:26:12,421 --> 01:26:13,528
Let us leave.

1144
01:26:15,473 --> 01:26:17,558
What is this? I miss something...

1145
01:26:17,638 --> 01:26:20,273
I miss something...

1146
01:26:20,741 --> 01:26:22,990
What is it? Well...

1147
01:26:23,750 --> 01:26:26,881
'Have I become crazy as he said?'

1148
01:26:27,617 --> 01:26:31,526
'She scares.
Makes us mad... Kills.'

1149
01:26:31,682 --> 01:26:34,441
'I am missing some clue.'

1150
01:26:34,735 --> 01:26:36,473
'Missing a clue.'

1151
01:26:36,988 --> 01:26:38,346
'Open the door.'

1152
01:26:38,557 --> 01:26:40,443
'Come on.'

1153
01:26:41,492 --> 01:26:44,065
'Could not see anyone.'

1154
01:26:44,965 --> 01:26:46,605
'What do you mean by that?'

1155
01:26:48,128 --> 01:26:50,896
'Something is wrong.
Something...'

1156
01:26:50,976 --> 01:26:52,833
'Wrong...
- Ranagiri!'

1157
01:26:52,913 --> 01:26:54,339
'Something is wrong.'

1158
01:26:57,443 --> 01:26:59,199
'What is it that I am missing?'

1159
01:26:59,916 --> 01:27:01,923
'Well...'

1160
01:27:09,292 --> 01:27:12,671
'Do not open the well.'

1161
01:27:13,481 --> 01:27:15,265
'Don't open.'

1162
01:27:15,603 --> 01:27:17,343
'Do not open the well.'

1163
01:27:20,254 --> 01:27:21,413
Sir!

1164
01:27:31,479 --> 01:27:32,885
One hour over.

1165
01:27:34,080 --> 01:27:36,406
For the 1st time
I feel that I have lost.

1166
01:27:36,717 --> 01:27:39,234
I am unable to come to a
logical conclusion to this case.

1167
01:27:39,780 --> 01:27:41,045
As they say,

1168
01:27:42,083 --> 01:27:45,315
there is no logic for the
incidents happening in Ranagiri.

1169
01:27:47,073 --> 01:27:49,495
To me the case is closed.

1170
01:27:53,404 --> 01:27:55,203
Have you packed the luggage?

1171
01:27:55,445 --> 01:27:56,405
Ready sir.

1172
01:27:56,648 --> 01:27:57,737
Let us start

1173
01:28:22,609 --> 01:28:23,829
Bye Bro.

1174
01:28:24,573 --> 01:28:26,095
Bye.
- Thank you sir.

1175
01:28:26,812 --> 01:28:29,347
Sir.
- Sir, safe journey.

1176
01:28:29,427 --> 01:28:30,618
Thank you.

1177
01:28:33,896 --> 01:28:34,856
See you.

1178
01:28:36,179 --> 01:28:37,606
Take care of your health.
Be safe.

1179
01:28:38,479 --> 01:28:39,482
Okay sir.
- Bye.

1180
01:28:39,562 --> 01:28:40,733
Thanks.
- Take care.

1181
01:28:40,930 --> 01:28:42,628
Bye sir.
- Clear your loans soon.

1182
01:28:42,708 --> 01:28:43,621
Alright sir.

1183
01:28:47,553 --> 01:28:50,615
Sir, I left the car keys
in the room.

1184
01:28:50,695 --> 01:28:51,600
Go and get it.

1185
01:28:51,782 --> 01:28:52,667
Wait!

1186
01:28:52,978 --> 01:28:53,815
Sir.

1187
01:28:53,961 --> 01:28:55,884
What did you say?
- I left the keys in the room.

1188
01:28:56,479 --> 01:28:59,945
'Left the keys in the room, sir.'

1189
01:29:03,674 --> 01:29:04,622
Govindu!

1190
01:29:04,702 --> 01:29:06,213
Sir!
- You are a genius.

1191
01:29:09,739 --> 01:29:11,339
What happened, sir?

1192
01:29:12,118 --> 01:29:13,347
He is coming back.

1193
01:29:13,427 --> 01:29:14,454
He is back.

1194
01:29:15,214 --> 01:29:16,127
Pritam.
- Sir.

1195
01:29:16,207 --> 01:29:17,669
He has left the
car keys in the room.

1196
01:29:17,749 --> 01:29:18,908
Will you give the master key?

1197
01:29:18,988 --> 01:29:20,725
Sure sir. Take.

1198
01:29:22,474 --> 01:29:23,554
Thank you.

1199
01:29:29,476 --> 01:29:31,517
Why are you going that side?
Our room is in this side.

1200
01:29:31,597 --> 01:29:33,195
Is it? Then here?

1201
01:29:33,498 --> 01:29:35,763
It is Roshan's room.
- I have to go there. Come.

1202
01:29:35,843 --> 01:29:36,853
What?

1203
01:29:37,701 --> 01:29:38,903
Govindu!
- Sir.

1204
01:29:38,983 --> 01:29:40,491
How many times have
we come to Roshan's room?

1205
01:29:40,571 --> 01:29:42,588
This is the 2nd time.
- Who opened the door last time?

1206
01:29:42,668 --> 01:29:44,034
Pritam.
- How?

1207
01:29:44,255 --> 01:29:47,993
With this Key.
- Exactly. Then which key is that?

1208
01:29:52,120 --> 01:29:54,187
A room has 2 keys.

1209
01:29:54,671 --> 01:29:57,196
One is with the customer

1210
01:29:57,559 --> 01:30:00,223
and the other a
master key which is with the hotel.

1211
01:30:00,570 --> 01:30:02,879
'I used the master key and came in.'

1212
01:30:03,165 --> 01:30:05,725
Roshan's key is here.

1213
01:30:06,261 --> 01:30:08,285
It means Roshan did not
get out of the room.

1214
01:30:08,365 --> 01:30:10,291
But the body was found in the pool.

1215
01:30:10,525 --> 01:30:12,981
Postmortem report says
that death was by drowning.

1216
01:30:13,061 --> 01:30:15,169
'Postmortem says
he died of drowning.'

1217
01:30:15,249 --> 01:30:17,919
'Body was found in the pool.
But he did not leave the room. How?'

1218
01:30:18,110 --> 01:30:20,019
It says he died of drowning.

1219
01:30:20,331 --> 01:30:22,219
But it is not necessary
that he drowned in the pool.

1220
01:30:22,558 --> 01:30:23,790
It might have happened here.

1221
01:30:24,918 --> 01:30:26,717
How is it possible in this room?

1222
01:30:26,925 --> 01:30:29,236
Here means... There.

1223
01:30:32,923 --> 01:30:34,048
Yes.

1224
01:30:34,128 --> 01:30:36,275
The murderer drowned
Roshan in this bathtub

1225
01:30:36,355 --> 01:30:38,664
and then shifted his
body to the swimming pool.

1226
01:30:38,854 --> 01:30:41,250
You mean like the
famous 'Sridevi' case.

1227
01:30:41,441 --> 01:30:43,335
Roshan weighed 100 Kgs.

1228
01:30:43,671 --> 01:30:45,358
How is it possible to drown

1229
01:30:45,438 --> 01:30:47,719
and kill him in
the bathtub so easily?

1230
01:30:47,996 --> 01:30:50,461
You have a point.
Why didn't Roshan attack back

1231
01:30:50,541 --> 01:30:52,191
when the killer attacked him?

1232
01:30:52,271 --> 01:30:54,811
The gun was nearby.
But he did not use it.

1233
01:30:54,891 --> 01:30:56,038
Why? Think.

1234
01:30:56,687 --> 01:30:58,503
Roshan knew the attacker.

1235
01:30:58,583 --> 01:31:01,296
And the attacker made Roshan
a dummy before drowning him.

1236
01:31:01,376 --> 01:31:04,375
How is it possible?
- Weakness...

1237
01:31:04,455 --> 01:31:07,090
He knew Roshan's
weakness and misused it.

1238
01:31:07,170 --> 01:31:09,149
What was his weakness?
What was Roshan's weakness?

1239
01:31:09,229 --> 01:31:12,533
Sir...
- Please I am thinking. Shut up...

1240
01:31:22,305 --> 01:31:23,230
Asthalin.

1241
01:31:30,167 --> 01:31:32,367
Missing object. Asthalin inhaler.

1242
01:31:32,858 --> 01:31:34,435
Roshan was an Asthma patient.

1243
01:31:34,635 --> 01:31:38,330
They hid his inhaler and
made him suffer from Asthma attack.

1244
01:31:38,558 --> 01:31:42,753
The fact is if strong
deodorants are used in rooms,

1245
01:31:42,833 --> 01:31:44,480
the Asthma patients get attack.

1246
01:31:44,619 --> 01:31:47,781
Point. Asthma, Asthalin.
These are personal details.

1247
01:31:47,970 --> 01:31:49,188
Who knew about it?

1248
01:31:49,699 --> 01:31:50,664
Who?

1249
01:31:50,744 --> 01:31:54,016
Family, family friend,
family doctor.

1250
01:31:54,355 --> 01:31:56,458
Or a close friend
with medical knowledge.

1251
01:31:56,811 --> 01:31:58,036
Exactly.

1252
01:31:59,745 --> 01:32:01,869
Who is it?
- Dr Anjali.

1253
01:32:03,128 --> 01:32:04,650
Am I a suspect now?

1254
01:32:04,817 --> 01:32:06,498
What happened?
- This is what happened.

1255
01:32:06,671 --> 01:32:09,681
Killer Dr Anjali.
Murder weapon is deodorant spray.

1256
01:32:09,761 --> 01:32:12,746
She knew he was asthmatic,
misused it and made him dummy.

1257
01:32:12,826 --> 01:32:15,500
But... Something is wrong.

1258
01:32:15,992 --> 01:32:19,119
How did Anjali shift Roshan who
weighed 100 kgs from the bathtub?

1259
01:32:19,486 --> 01:32:20,952
Anjali did not kill him alone.

1260
01:32:21,340 --> 01:32:22,710
She had an accomplice.

1261
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:26,702
Someone helped her and
that person is lying to me.

1262
01:32:26,958 --> 01:32:28,107
Who is that person?

1263
01:32:28,501 --> 01:32:30,355
Pritam! What did Pritam say?

1264
01:32:30,435 --> 01:32:33,060
I had to go and call SI Rudresh.

1265
01:32:33,140 --> 01:32:36,305
But when we sat in the same
car next day, he adjusted the seat.

1266
01:32:37,004 --> 01:32:42,092
So the person who drove
before him was shorter than him.

1267
01:32:42,172 --> 01:32:43,357
It is some other person.

1268
01:32:43,617 --> 01:32:44,470
Who was it?

1269
01:32:49,464 --> 01:32:52,240
Anwar! Anwar, Pritam and Anjali
together committed the murder.

1270
01:32:52,396 --> 01:32:55,604
Anwar and Anjali will escape.
Pritam will be in resort.

1271
01:32:55,684 --> 01:32:57,161
Anwar was missing since 2 days.

1272
01:32:57,241 --> 01:33:02,308
They said so.
But he never went missing.

1273
01:33:02,388 --> 01:33:04,167
They have planned it together.

1274
01:33:04,418 --> 01:33:06,027
But Rudresh was searching for him.

1275
01:33:06,107 --> 01:33:08,171
He didn't go missing.
Then how will Rudresh get him?

1276
01:33:08,251 --> 01:33:09,694
He is also part of the gang.

1277
01:33:10,031 --> 01:33:12,859
Do you say he fixed us
in spite of being in our side?

1278
01:33:12,939 --> 01:33:16,639
Yes. SI Rudresh was posted
in Ranagiri 3 months back.

1279
01:33:16,719 --> 01:33:20,013
Anwar joined as Roshan's
driver 3 months back.

1280
01:33:20,206 --> 01:33:22,573
So it was all preplanned.

1281
01:33:22,653 --> 01:33:26,282
Anjali, Anwar, Pritam, Rudresh.
Total 4 persons are killers.

1282
01:33:26,531 --> 01:33:29,831
And of course Ranganayaki.

1283
01:33:30,779 --> 01:33:35,546
Someone has created
a ghost named Ranganayaki.

1284
01:33:36,106 --> 01:33:38,002
Who told that story first?

1285
01:33:38,082 --> 01:33:39,677
'This has been done by a spirit.'

1286
01:33:39,757 --> 01:33:44,091
The persons who confirmed
it are Bro and Eureka.

1287
01:33:44,439 --> 01:33:45,503
'Well...'

1288
01:33:45,659 --> 01:33:49,678
The persons who supported
them and validated it...

1289
01:33:49,758 --> 01:33:51,692
'Felt as if someone
knocked at my door.'

1290
01:33:51,772 --> 01:33:53,249
'This place is haunted, sir.'

1291
01:33:53,329 --> 01:33:58,909
NRI Soukhya Ajjampura
and her Bengali husband Somjit.

1292
01:33:59,956 --> 01:34:02,931
Soukhya! Don't exaggerate.

1293
01:34:03,224 --> 01:34:05,655
That Bengali is an
electrical engineer.

1294
01:34:07,316 --> 01:34:10,585
So lights flicker
in the entire building.

1295
01:34:14,268 --> 01:34:16,690
'Why have you tied colorful
threads to everyone?'

1296
01:34:16,770 --> 01:34:19,691
'It is not a thread.
It is for protection.'

1297
01:34:19,855 --> 01:34:21,827
He said your time is bad.

1298
01:34:23,912 --> 01:34:28,089
Ranganayaki is a ploy. It is drama.

1299
01:34:29,732 --> 01:34:32,837
But you saw Ranganayaki.

1300
01:34:34,204 --> 01:34:36,582
I cannot understand only that.

1301
01:34:37,438 --> 01:34:38,857
I saw that ghost.

1302
01:34:44,271 --> 01:34:46,485
You did not see. Isn't it?
- No sir.

1303
01:34:47,825 --> 01:34:49,690
I could see but you did not.

1304
01:34:49,770 --> 01:34:51,958
I was affected but
you were not affected.

1305
01:34:52,038 --> 01:34:53,856
Then you have not done
something which I did.

1306
01:34:53,936 --> 01:34:55,509
They have used it. What is that?

1307
01:35:03,636 --> 01:35:04,901
'Sir, tea.'

1308
01:35:06,230 --> 01:35:11,106
Tea Govindu. I drink coffee but
they were supplying me tea often.

1309
01:35:11,252 --> 01:35:14,203
You do not drink coffee or tea.
- My drink is different.

1310
01:35:14,283 --> 01:35:18,683
So they mixed some medicine
which will create anxiety.

1311
01:35:18,891 --> 01:35:20,620
Some hallucination.

1312
01:35:21,235 --> 01:35:22,437
'Clinical depression.'

1313
01:35:23,441 --> 01:35:25,612
They knew I have anxiety problems.

1314
01:35:25,692 --> 01:35:27,921
And they knew that
my tablets are exhausted.

1315
01:35:28,120 --> 01:35:31,181
They also knew that I have informed
Rudresh to get those tablets.

1316
01:35:31,261 --> 01:35:33,370
So when I was weak,

1317
01:35:33,450 --> 01:35:37,745
they induced some drug
to me and made me imagine things.

1318
01:35:37,825 --> 01:35:41,203
So Ranganayaki was
just an imagination.

1319
01:35:43,916 --> 01:35:47,825
Sir, all of them targeted you.
- Yes.

1320
01:35:48,052 --> 01:35:50,944
They were smart. But I am smarter.

1321
01:35:51,319 --> 01:35:53,976
I am Shivaji Surathkal.

1322
01:35:54,056 --> 01:35:57,228
When Roshan was in the room...

1323
01:36:02,122 --> 01:36:03,082
Who is it?

1324
01:36:04,345 --> 01:36:05,400
Anjali!

1325
01:36:07,657 --> 01:36:09,993
Give the Asthalin. Anjali!
What are you doing?

1326
01:36:10,296 --> 01:36:11,316
Catch him.

1327
01:36:11,745 --> 01:36:12,818
Hurry up.

1328
01:36:13,704 --> 01:36:15,925
Who are you? Leave me.

1329
01:36:16,229 --> 01:36:18,193
Lift him.
- I am home minister's son.

1330
01:36:18,273 --> 01:36:19,459
Leave me.

1331
01:36:19,729 --> 01:36:21,022
Anjali!
- Come on.

1332
01:36:21,327 --> 01:36:23,234
I can't breath.
- Quick...

1333
01:36:23,882 --> 01:36:24,981
Leave me.

1334
01:36:30,949 --> 01:36:32,039
Leave.

1335
01:36:38,854 --> 01:36:40,368
Come.

1336
01:36:44,414 --> 01:36:45,647
Careful...

1337
01:36:46,285 --> 01:36:48,296
Come on. Push him.

1338
01:36:49,607 --> 01:36:52,539
Run!
- Run fast.

1339
01:36:52,619 --> 01:36:54,209
Let's go.

1340
01:37:08,119 --> 01:37:12,238
So the murder was not committed
by one or two persons,

1341
01:37:12,735 --> 01:37:14,573
11 persons have committed it.

1342
01:37:17,105 --> 01:37:17,996
Wicked people.

1343
01:37:18,076 --> 01:37:19,630
An entire cricket team.

1344
01:37:21,221 --> 01:37:23,124
Call SP and minister.

1345
01:37:23,289 --> 01:37:26,895
Tell the case investigation
is over and he can come to Ranagiri.

1346
01:37:26,975 --> 01:37:30,779
Let me update score
card to the cricket team!

1347
01:37:35,971 --> 01:37:41,613
Stars shine in darkness.
Truth also shines in the same way.

1348
01:37:41,693 --> 01:37:46,822
The more you hide it, it will come
out with force and prick our eyes.

1349
01:37:46,902 --> 01:37:51,812
It is logical to have
one murderer in a murder case.

1350
01:37:52,038 --> 01:37:55,952
But 11 persons have joined
and committed the murder.

1351
01:37:56,536 --> 01:37:58,049
Wow!

1352
01:37:58,287 --> 01:38:00,427
Great team work People.

1353
01:38:00,729 --> 01:38:04,373
Did you think that if
everyone says the same lie,

1354
01:38:04,453 --> 01:38:06,027
people will believe it?

1355
01:38:06,589 --> 01:38:08,027
What is it called in Psychiatry?

1356
01:38:08,107 --> 01:38:11,206
Yes. Gas light effect.

1357
01:38:11,887 --> 01:38:14,698
You almost made me believe

1358
01:38:14,778 --> 01:38:18,672
it by saying that I am
crazy and imagining things.

1359
01:38:19,001 --> 01:38:21,751
Great team, people!

1360
01:38:22,971 --> 01:38:25,678
But remember one thing.

1361
01:38:25,938 --> 01:38:30,132
You may deceive anyone
in life except two persons.

1362
01:38:30,547 --> 01:38:36,956
One is your conscience and
the other is Shivaji Surathkal.

1363
01:38:37,284 --> 01:38:38,313
But one question.

1364
01:38:38,393 --> 01:38:42,300
If you are one team, what
is the connection amongst you all?

1365
01:38:42,517 --> 01:38:45,215
You cannot be friends because
you belong to different age groups.

1366
01:38:45,295 --> 01:38:46,893
You do not belong
to the same native,

1367
01:38:46,973 --> 01:38:48,640
because your accents are different.

1368
01:38:48,849 --> 01:38:51,651
You do not work in the same place.
You are not friends

1369
01:38:51,731 --> 01:38:55,417
family or colleagues.
But what is the connection?

1370
01:38:58,967 --> 01:39:04,143
Can you say Mrs Soukhya Ajjampura?

1371
01:39:05,139 --> 01:39:06,751
Daughter of Srinivasa Ajjampura.

1372
01:39:06,910 --> 01:39:08,718
Your father was a
popular stage artist.

1373
01:39:08,798 --> 01:39:13,190
He died in 2006 on
stage due to heart attack.

1374
01:39:13,270 --> 01:39:15,271
Correct? May his soul rest in peace!

1375
01:39:15,351 --> 01:39:18,820
You were running that
drama troupe after he died.

1376
01:39:19,575 --> 01:39:23,248
You all were doing different
characters in that drama troupe.

1377
01:39:23,328 --> 01:39:25,235
You are all actors.

1378
01:39:26,003 --> 01:39:27,490
Artists!

1379
01:39:29,614 --> 01:39:34,160
It is easy to apply make-
up and act as killer on stage.

1380
01:39:34,298 --> 01:39:40,020
But you have committed a cold
blooded murder in real life. How?

1381
01:39:40,823 --> 01:39:44,103
And people like you.
And you. You...

1382
01:39:44,849 --> 01:39:46,558
You are all middle class people.

1383
01:39:47,160 --> 01:39:52,527
You get scared even when there
is police verification for passport.

1384
01:39:53,642 --> 01:39:57,810
But you have planned
and killed a person...

1385
01:39:58,831 --> 01:40:00,846
There must be a strong
reason for that.

1386
01:40:01,123 --> 01:40:02,282
What is the motive?

1387
01:40:07,093 --> 01:40:09,774
Why did you kill?
Personal revenge?

1388
01:40:10,337 --> 01:40:12,810
Vengeance. What is the reason?

1389
01:40:13,234 --> 01:40:14,826
Why did you kill?

1390
01:40:17,005 --> 01:40:18,761
Eureka Lobo

1391
01:40:20,068 --> 01:40:23,502
D/o Valerian Lobo

1392
01:40:23,934 --> 01:40:26,339
alias Bhat.

1393
01:40:26,494 --> 01:40:29,789
They call you 'Bhat'.
Is it because you cook well?

1394
01:40:29,979 --> 01:40:33,041
When we met 1st time you said that
after your last daughter died...

1395
01:40:34,053 --> 01:40:35,385
Last daughter...

1396
01:40:36,146 --> 01:40:39,657
If she is the 1st daughter,
who is the last daughter?

1397
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:40,869
Tell me.

1398
01:40:41,777 --> 01:40:42,702
Come on.

1399
01:40:42,782 --> 01:40:45,721
No! Sir, please do not
harm him. Please.

1400
01:40:45,894 --> 01:40:46,940
Jessica...

1401
01:40:47,961 --> 01:40:49,483
Jessica is my sister.

1402
01:40:50,582 --> 01:40:53,081
She was 16 years old.

1403
01:40:53,272 --> 01:40:56,783
Yes. Jessica was blind.

1404
01:40:57,596 --> 01:41:01,159
But no limits to her dreams.

1405
01:41:04,791 --> 01:41:08,061
She was the centre of
attraction for our entire group.

1406
01:41:10,093 --> 01:41:11,519
She entertained everyone.

1407
01:41:12,592 --> 01:41:14,002
Very lively girl.

1408
01:41:28,525 --> 01:41:34,006
But she was unable to
apply even henna on her own.

1409
01:41:34,579 --> 01:41:37,141
Such an innocent girl.
How could she...?

1410
01:41:39,043 --> 01:41:40,157
Okay.

1411
01:41:40,838 --> 01:41:42,254
I get it.

1412
01:41:44,113 --> 01:41:47,518
But Dr Anjali, you loved Roshan.

1413
01:41:47,746 --> 01:41:49,821
Why did you join them
and commit this murder?

1414
01:41:50,595 --> 01:41:54,920
Roshan acted differently
when he was with his friends.

1415
01:41:56,347 --> 01:41:57,661
Bunty was a rogue.

1416
01:41:59,036 --> 01:42:00,169
What did you say?

1417
01:42:01,035 --> 01:42:02,098
Who is Bunty?

1418
01:42:03,612 --> 01:42:06,846
Roshan's friends called him Bunty.

1419
01:42:07,988 --> 01:42:09,363
'Bunty!'

1420
01:42:11,128 --> 01:42:12,918
'But she is pregnant.'

1421
01:42:15,936 --> 01:42:20,001
Bunty committed 3 murders.

1422
01:42:21,471 --> 01:42:24,195
It started with Jessica.

1423
01:42:31,283 --> 01:42:32,251
Hello!

1424
01:42:32,666 --> 01:42:34,015
Hi Sweetheart!
- Bunty,

1425
01:42:34,095 --> 01:42:36,111
will come home in the evening.

1426
01:42:36,388 --> 01:42:39,751
Okay sweetheart. I am in a meeting.

1427
01:42:40,298 --> 01:42:42,519
Cannot hear properly.
Will call later.

1428
01:42:42,948 --> 01:42:44,422
You are a lucky fellow.

1429
01:42:44,573 --> 01:42:46,044
Your girlfriend believes you a lot.

1430
01:42:46,124 --> 01:42:49,892
Rakesh, we have to act in front
of girlfriend but do as we please.

1431
01:42:50,118 --> 01:42:52,609
That is why I told
you to find a girlfriend.

1432
01:42:52,790 --> 01:42:56,016
There is a girl in your station.
Try to woo her.

1433
01:42:56,273 --> 01:42:58,554
Her boyfriend is SI.

1434
01:42:58,758 --> 01:43:01,802
He will harm us if we try.

1435
01:43:02,476 --> 01:43:03,748
Wicked fellow!

1436
01:43:05,962 --> 01:43:09,283
Sir, someone told
me the bathroom is here.

1437
01:43:09,363 --> 01:43:11,083
Ladies toilet is the next one.
Go there.

1438
01:43:13,279 --> 01:43:14,274
Thank you.

1439
01:43:17,646 --> 01:43:21,244
She is blind but
did you see her dress!

1440
01:43:21,849 --> 01:43:23,760
Wicked fellow!

1441
01:43:24,807 --> 01:43:27,653
Are you thinking what I am thinking?

1442
01:43:29,235 --> 01:43:33,222
Anyone can harm her here.
Nobody can identify.

1443
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:35,851
She is very young.

1444
01:43:36,301 --> 01:43:39,267
Come. I am the striker
and you are non-striker.

1445
01:43:39,543 --> 01:43:40,625
Let us go.

1446
01:43:52,534 --> 01:43:53,494
Sir!

1447
01:43:54,065 --> 01:43:55,310
Who is that?

1448
01:43:58,570 --> 01:43:59,980
Who is here?

1449
01:44:02,670 --> 01:44:03,838
Who is that?

1450
01:44:07,600 --> 01:44:09,459
Who is that? Please.

1451
01:44:22,562 --> 01:44:23,496
Sir.

1452
01:44:25,755 --> 01:44:28,141
Leave me!
- Catch her...

1453
01:44:28,711 --> 01:44:30,597
Leave me!

1454
01:44:31,520 --> 01:44:33,762
Come on.
- Leave me!

1455
01:44:33,842 --> 01:44:35,275
Help!

1456
01:44:48,597 --> 01:44:49,959
Help!

1457
01:45:12,303 --> 01:45:14,033
Bunty! What did you do?

1458
01:45:14,487 --> 01:45:16,130
She is dead.
- What?

1459
01:45:16,991 --> 01:45:19,034
What happened?
- She is dead.

1460
01:45:19,315 --> 01:45:21,521
What to do now?
- I have an idea.

1461
01:45:21,794 --> 01:45:23,354
Let us change the place of death.

1462
01:45:23,434 --> 01:45:26,125
Come on. Bring her.

1463
01:45:34,195 --> 01:45:36,513
Rakesh used police influence

1464
01:45:36,770 --> 01:45:39,676
and shifted Jessica's
body to government hospital.

1465
01:45:45,192 --> 01:45:48,338
Sister, what happened actually?
What is the cause of death?

1466
01:45:48,543 --> 01:45:50,651
Sir, that...

1467
01:45:51,354 --> 01:45:53,332
How can I tell you?
- Please say.

1468
01:45:54,608 --> 01:45:56,241
To say in medical terms,

1469
01:45:56,321 --> 01:45:58,468
her hymen ruptured and
there was plenty of blood loss.

1470
01:46:02,089 --> 01:46:04,737
She must have been a virgin.

1471
01:46:06,444 --> 01:46:10,088
Because of forcible and stressful
intercourse she had lot of pain,

1472
01:46:10,168 --> 01:46:12,488
couldn't bear and
had cardiac arrest.

1473
01:46:20,273 --> 01:46:22,100
Is there any other
information you can give us?

1474
01:46:22,180 --> 01:46:23,308
Sorry sir.

1475
01:46:23,388 --> 01:46:27,105
Since this is police case,
you have to speak to SI Rakesh.

1476
01:46:27,277 --> 01:46:28,953
Can't help you.
- Okay doctor.

1477
01:46:29,033 --> 01:46:30,337
Thank you.

1478
01:46:30,628 --> 01:46:33,277
Lobo, come with me.

1479
01:46:41,114 --> 01:46:43,849
You know that girl.
I can understand your sorrow.

1480
01:46:44,033 --> 01:46:46,736
But case is closed.
- Case closed!

1481
01:46:47,558 --> 01:46:50,001
How can you close the case?
- How can the case be closed?

1482
01:46:50,081 --> 01:46:53,515
That girl's dead body
was lying on the road.

1483
01:46:53,595 --> 01:46:55,288
I brought it to hospital.

1484
01:46:55,472 --> 01:46:58,066
Someone raped her and
dumped her on the road.

1485
01:46:58,521 --> 01:47:01,781
The girl was wearing
a revealing dress.

1486
01:47:01,861 --> 01:47:04,099
Mister! Do not comment on Jessica's
character. Wonder who she was with!

1487
01:47:04,585 --> 01:47:07,590
She was a gem of a girl.
- Oh! Feeling for her!

1488
01:47:07,774 --> 01:47:09,136
Is there something
between you and the girl?

1489
01:47:09,216 --> 01:47:10,441
What nonsense is he saying!
- Sir!

1490
01:47:10,521 --> 01:47:12,500
Mind your words.
What are you talking?

1491
01:47:12,580 --> 01:47:14,247
Sir, no use talking with him.

1492
01:47:14,585 --> 01:47:16,911
I know a Lawyer. Let us file a case.

1493
01:47:16,991 --> 01:47:18,122
Truth will be proved in court.

1494
01:47:18,295 --> 01:47:19,713
Go!
- Let's go.

1495
01:47:19,852 --> 01:47:22,037
We know how to handle
court and lawyers.

1496
01:47:22,117 --> 01:47:24,934
Go! We have contacts everywhere.

1497
01:47:25,014 --> 01:47:26,200
Pritam knows a lawyer.
- Yes sir.

1498
01:47:26,280 --> 01:47:27,216
We can talk to her and see.

1499
01:47:27,296 --> 01:47:28,308
Will call her now.

1500
01:47:28,463 --> 01:47:30,574
Don't worry sir.
I will take up the case.

1501
01:47:30,930 --> 01:47:33,257
But we need a strong witness.

1502
01:47:33,413 --> 01:47:34,987
Spoke to lawyer.

1503
01:47:35,480 --> 01:47:37,642
She feels it will be
better if we have a witness.

1504
01:47:39,078 --> 01:47:41,257
Where can we search for witness?

1505
01:47:44,483 --> 01:47:46,671
I am there as witness.

1506
01:47:48,704 --> 01:47:49,984
You?

1507
01:47:52,699 --> 01:47:55,302
I am Anjali, Roshan's girlfriend.

1508
01:48:07,449 --> 01:48:08,692
I am sorry.

1509
01:48:09,220 --> 01:48:10,880
I was terribly scared.

1510
01:48:11,356 --> 01:48:14,253
Didn't know how to
handle the situation.

1511
01:48:15,628 --> 01:48:17,202
Why are you apologizing?

1512
01:48:17,282 --> 01:48:19,338
Now I know what
happened to my sister.

1513
01:48:20,021 --> 01:48:21,292
That is enough.

1514
01:48:22,010 --> 01:48:25,029
Sir, give me the
lawyer madam's number.

1515
01:48:25,109 --> 01:48:26,447
I will go and meet her.

1516
01:48:28,972 --> 01:48:32,579
I went to her house
to meet the lawyer.

1517
01:48:33,123 --> 01:48:35,709
I saw Bunty again there.

1518
01:48:59,239 --> 01:49:00,986
Hello! Police control room?

1519
01:49:01,168 --> 01:49:03,772
Bunty and his friend...

1520
01:49:04,109 --> 01:49:05,449
In an ambulance...

1521
01:49:05,648 --> 01:49:07,923
The Lawyer is wearing green shawl.

1522
01:49:08,003 --> 01:49:11,284
I cannot say more. Sorry.

1523
01:49:11,364 --> 01:49:13,689
I am telling 100% truth.

1524
01:49:15,374 --> 01:49:19,914
After 2 days I came to know
that Bunty committed 2 more murders.

1525
01:49:21,795 --> 01:49:23,601
He has killed lawyer madam.

1526
01:49:24,041 --> 01:49:26,143
She was the only one to support us.

1527
01:49:26,223 --> 01:49:27,700
Now he has killed her.

1528
01:49:27,907 --> 01:49:30,164
Roshan and his father
are very influential.

1529
01:49:30,475 --> 01:49:33,632
They killed Rakesh
and spread stories

1530
01:49:33,712 --> 01:49:35,794
that he is responsible
for the other murders.

1531
01:49:36,070 --> 01:49:38,985
25000 rape cases are being
filed in India every year.

1532
01:49:39,065 --> 01:49:40,620
But how many are punished?

1533
01:49:40,700 --> 01:49:42,168
Isn't there Justice?

1534
01:49:42,248 --> 01:49:43,646
Are those two lives unworthy?

1535
01:49:43,726 --> 01:49:44,831
How can we fight for justice?

1536
01:49:44,911 --> 01:49:46,769
They have money. What do we have?

1537
01:49:46,849 --> 01:49:48,196
We are there.

1538
01:49:48,361 --> 01:49:50,773
Yes. Intelligence is mightier
than physical strength.

1539
01:49:50,937 --> 01:49:52,788
If we decide, we can do anything.

1540
01:49:52,868 --> 01:49:55,487
Then let us kill the wicked Roshan.

1541
01:49:55,677 --> 01:49:58,522
But who will kill him?
- I will kill.

1542
01:49:58,894 --> 01:50:01,377
I have no one.
I have nothing to lose.

1543
01:50:01,457 --> 01:50:02,708
What the hell are you talking?

1544
01:50:02,891 --> 01:50:04,456
Commit murder? We?

1545
01:50:04,785 --> 01:50:05,944
We have family.

1546
01:50:06,024 --> 01:50:08,175
Do you know the consequences
if police know about this?

1547
01:50:08,373 --> 01:50:12,663
They indulge in such heinous
act because we remain quiet.

1548
01:50:12,819 --> 01:50:16,296
Before other girls are harmed...
- Let us kill the bloody bastard.

1549
01:50:16,376 --> 01:50:20,153
He killed my sister and lawyer.
Let us scare him and kill.

1550
01:50:20,233 --> 01:50:22,316
We will kill Roshan.

1551
01:50:41,518 --> 01:50:46,688
Sir, if you still want to arrest us,

1552
01:50:47,932 --> 01:50:49,737
arrest only me.

1553
01:50:50,508 --> 01:50:55,135
Because 2 crimes happened
in front of my eyes,

1554
01:50:55,514 --> 01:50:57,254
but I couldn't stop them.

1555
01:50:58,389 --> 01:51:01,470
What would you have done
if Jessica was your sister?

1556
01:51:02,940 --> 01:51:08,475
Or if the lawyer was your wife,
what would you have done?

1557
01:51:12,776 --> 01:51:14,013
The lawyer

1558
01:51:16,841 --> 01:51:17,776
is my wife.

1559
01:51:23,251 --> 01:51:24,678
Her name is

1560
01:51:26,786 --> 01:51:28,029
Janani.

1561
01:51:30,640 --> 01:51:34,883
She was 7 months pregnant

1562
01:51:36,129 --> 01:51:38,150
when she was murdered.

1563
01:51:41,674 --> 01:51:46,950
Since last 3-4 years,

1564
01:51:48,042 --> 01:51:53,339
I have been searching
for her killer.

1565
01:51:55,015 --> 01:51:59,328
Now I know that my wife gave up

1566
01:51:59,408 --> 01:52:02,604
her life fighting
for an innocent girl.

1567
01:52:04,756 --> 01:52:05,891
Thank you.

1568
01:52:06,561 --> 01:52:07,782
Thanks to you.

1569
01:52:08,409 --> 01:52:11,458
And... Thank you all.

1570
01:52:18,337 --> 01:52:19,340
Anyway,

1571
01:52:21,978 --> 01:52:23,587
as a police officer,

1572
01:52:24,296 --> 01:52:28,275
I cannot justify the murder
committed by all of you together.

1573
01:52:29,149 --> 01:52:30,588
You will be punished

1574
01:52:32,815 --> 01:52:33,863
as per law.

1575
01:53:02,534 --> 01:53:03,606
Shit!

1576
01:53:04,290 --> 01:53:07,110
Ji! Why are you so confused?

1577
01:53:08,035 --> 01:53:09,194
Jaanu!

1578
01:53:09,696 --> 01:53:13,587
I had promised you that I will find
out your killer and punish them.

1579
01:53:13,899 --> 01:53:15,551
Now Roshan has been punished.

1580
01:53:16,078 --> 01:53:18,898
But I cannot agree to the
way the punishment was given.

1581
01:53:19,962 --> 01:53:22,297
They have planned and
committed this murder.

1582
01:53:22,377 --> 01:53:23,404
It is against law.

1583
01:53:23,484 --> 01:53:26,898
Law did not help when
Jessica and I were killed.

1584
01:53:26,978 --> 01:53:29,977
Come on Jaanu. You are a lawyer.
How can you speak against law?

1585
01:53:30,245 --> 01:53:33,047
Justice and duty are
more important than law.

1586
01:53:33,376 --> 01:53:36,888
We have to find out another route
if law doesn't give us justice.

1587
01:53:37,077 --> 01:53:39,118
Do not argue for the sake of it.

1588
01:53:39,464 --> 01:53:40,814
They have done a wrong thing.

1589
01:53:41,575 --> 01:53:44,152
You think they are wrong.

1590
01:53:44,429 --> 01:53:46,756
But they feel they
did a right thing.

1591
01:53:47,024 --> 01:53:48,157
That's what matters.

1592
01:53:48,779 --> 01:53:52,818
But still... I cannot justify this.

1593
01:53:53,493 --> 01:53:57,247
Exactly. Think from your heart.

1594
01:53:57,782 --> 01:54:00,377
Heart is not as confused as mind.

1595
01:54:00,792 --> 01:54:02,868
Right means right
and wrong means wrong.

1596
01:54:03,084 --> 01:54:05,765
They have done whatever
they felt was right.

1597
01:54:06,310 --> 01:54:09,095
And you do whatever
you feel is right.

1598
01:54:53,118 --> 01:54:54,545
Welcome sir.
- Thank you.

1599
01:54:56,199 --> 01:54:57,735
Have I seen you somewhere before?

1600
01:54:57,815 --> 01:54:58,958
Definitely you have seen.

1601
01:54:59,038 --> 01:55:01,596
You decide the fate
of policemen like us.

1602
01:55:01,676 --> 01:55:04,406
Rakesh death case...

1603
01:55:04,596 --> 01:55:05,452
Yes.

1604
01:55:05,867 --> 01:55:07,277
Sorry. I have become aged.
So forgot.

1605
01:55:07,615 --> 01:55:08,591
But I have not forgotten.

1606
01:55:09,151 --> 01:55:11,026
Nice. You are...

1607
01:55:11,106 --> 01:55:12,562
Shivaji Surathkal.

1608
01:55:12,769 --> 01:55:15,156
Oh! Shivaji Surathkal?
- Yes sir.

1609
01:55:15,695 --> 01:55:17,439
You solve crimes with imagination.

1610
01:55:18,248 --> 01:55:19,182
Sir!
- Tell me.

1611
01:55:19,777 --> 01:55:21,431
It was his wife who died.

1612
01:55:23,714 --> 01:55:25,561
I am very sorry. Really.

1613
01:55:27,221 --> 01:55:30,788
FIR says Rakesh was the only
person guilty. But it is not so.

1614
01:55:30,868 --> 01:55:32,605
There are two masks.
There are 2 Pizza covers.

1615
01:55:32,685 --> 01:55:34,360
Two persons committed the murder.
Not one.

1616
01:55:35,363 --> 01:55:37,162
Two?
- Yes, sir.

1617
01:55:37,603 --> 01:55:39,419
One is Rakesh from our department.

1618
01:55:39,499 --> 01:55:42,835
I have heard the other person's
voice in my wife's call trace.

1619
01:55:43,016 --> 01:55:45,957
He speaks with Telugu accent.
His name is Bunty.

1620
01:55:47,202 --> 01:55:48,128
Bunty!

1621
01:55:48,863 --> 01:55:49,866
Yes sir.

1622
01:55:49,946 --> 01:55:53,819
Rakesh and Bunty kidnapped
my wife and brought her here.

1623
01:55:54,121 --> 01:55:56,266
Something happened here.

1624
01:55:56,551 --> 01:55:58,696
Bunty killed my wife with a rod.

1625
01:55:58,973 --> 01:56:00,339
Rakesh objected to it.

1626
01:56:00,419 --> 01:56:02,683
Bunty...
- Bunty got angry and killed him.

1627
01:56:02,899 --> 01:56:05,122
Then he planted evidence
that Rakesh is the killer

1628
01:56:05,202 --> 01:56:06,526
and escaped from there.

1629
01:56:06,928 --> 01:56:08,000
I will not spare him.

1630
01:56:08,080 --> 01:56:11,381
I will catch that bastard
Bunty within 48 hours.

1631
01:56:11,461 --> 01:56:13,211
Shiva relax...
- I will finish that bastard.

1632
01:56:13,784 --> 01:56:15,687
You are emotional because
it is your wife's case.

1633
01:56:16,179 --> 01:56:18,178
I perfectly understand.
- Go there.

1634
01:56:18,884 --> 01:56:20,641
Send them away.
- Go away.

1635
01:56:20,822 --> 01:56:24,876
Who allowed them inside?
- Media has already come here.

1636
01:56:25,124 --> 01:56:26,670
Waiting for some information.

1637
01:56:26,845 --> 01:56:28,920
Just imagine what they will write...

1638
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,102
You and your wife were
childless since many years.

1639
01:56:31,361 --> 01:56:33,934
Your wife and he had an affair.

1640
01:56:34,182 --> 01:56:35,565
Your wife was pregnant.

1641
01:56:35,738 --> 01:56:41,025
They will start gossiping
about the father of the child.

1642
01:56:41,105 --> 01:56:42,528
What nonsense is he talking?

1643
01:56:43,458 --> 01:56:47,663
It is not his words. He is
just saying what media will say.

1644
01:56:47,966 --> 01:56:49,220
Don't mistake us.

1645
01:56:49,480 --> 01:56:52,291
Media will cook up
stories after death.

1646
01:56:52,371 --> 01:56:53,480
Who wants it?

1647
01:56:53,664 --> 01:56:57,048
You have earned the reputation
of a sincere officer in this state.

1648
01:56:57,307 --> 01:56:58,729
If your reputation is spoiled,

1649
01:56:58,809 --> 01:57:01,529
our department's reputation
will also be spoiled. Do we need it?

1650
01:57:02,248 --> 01:57:04,810
Sir is right. Follow it.

1651
01:57:05,059 --> 01:57:06,237
Please...

1652
01:57:06,730 --> 01:57:08,525
Patil...
- Yes sir.

1653
01:57:09,984 --> 01:57:12,222
Just for record. Sign this.

1654
01:57:15,745 --> 01:57:18,199
Sir, Bunty's name
is not there in this.

1655
01:57:18,279 --> 01:57:20,978
Bunty's final rites
should be performed.

1656
01:57:21,058 --> 01:57:22,416
Concentrate on that.

1657
01:57:23,378 --> 01:57:24,686
I will take care of this.

1658
01:57:25,854 --> 01:57:26,978
Listen.
- Sir.

1659
01:57:27,394 --> 01:57:28,466
This is on record.

1660
01:57:28,804 --> 01:57:31,693
Full investigation must
be done off the record.

1661
01:57:31,773 --> 01:57:32,730
Yes sir.

1662
01:57:32,912 --> 01:57:35,264
And he should get justice.
- Definitely sir. Yes.

1663
01:57:35,982 --> 01:57:37,539
Sign. Please.

1664
01:57:57,923 --> 01:58:00,869
Shivaji! Many names are there!

1665
01:58:01,488 --> 01:58:03,218
Totally 11 persons.

1666
01:58:04,309 --> 01:58:05,812
Who are they?
- It is them.

1667
01:58:11,616 --> 01:58:15,141
There is an important connection
between them and your son's death.

1668
01:58:15,606 --> 01:58:17,000
What?
- Yes.

1669
01:58:17,368 --> 01:58:19,649
They are witnesses.

1670
01:58:19,973 --> 01:58:22,276
Then who killed my son?

1671
01:58:22,644 --> 01:58:24,244
I have written in the report.

1672
01:58:25,228 --> 01:58:28,017
Murdered by unidentified individual.

1673
01:58:28,212 --> 01:58:29,693
What do you mean?
- Sir.

1674
01:58:31,347 --> 01:58:35,553
Off the record...
I don't know how to say this.

1675
01:58:36,191 --> 01:58:40,353
One girl.
It is actually a supernatural power.

1676
01:58:40,732 --> 01:58:44,732
This place Ranagiri. No sir.

1677
01:58:45,488 --> 01:58:48,288
What nonsense is he talking?
Nonsense.

1678
01:58:48,516 --> 01:58:50,668
No sir. It is a fact.

1679
01:58:50,885 --> 01:58:54,312
She kills unmarried
boys on full moon day.

1680
01:58:54,788 --> 01:58:57,854
Your son was smart.
Why didn't you get him married?

1681
01:58:57,934 --> 01:58:59,030
Will you please shut up?

1682
01:58:59,333 --> 01:59:00,907
Do not become emotional
because he is your son.

1683
01:59:00,987 --> 01:59:04,125
Shivaji, be practical.
- I am very practical.

1684
01:59:04,513 --> 01:59:07,004
I studied this case from all angles.

1685
01:59:07,722 --> 01:59:09,082
I did not believe when I heard it.

1686
01:59:09,497 --> 01:59:10,904
And I did not believe when I saw it.

1687
01:59:10,984 --> 01:59:14,381
But I experienced it.
- What experience?

1688
01:59:42,953 --> 01:59:46,318
'May 17th, 2015. 5.00 p.m.'

1689
01:59:46,521 --> 01:59:51,751
'That was the last time
I heard Janani's voice.'

1690
01:59:54,151 --> 01:59:56,292
Ji!
- Jaanu, where are you?

1691
01:59:56,372 --> 02:00:00,141
I don't know.
- Trace the call.

1692
02:00:00,221 --> 02:00:02,953
I feel dizzy.
- Listen to me.

1693
02:00:03,033 --> 02:00:06,520
Now... Tell me in
detail about your place.

1694
02:00:06,600 --> 02:00:08,327
Forest.
- Okay. Forest. What else?

1695
02:00:08,604 --> 02:00:09,960
What else do you see nearby?

1696
02:00:10,107 --> 02:00:11,429
Beer bottles are lying here.

1697
02:00:12,284 --> 02:00:13,972
Two persons were wearing masks.
- Two persons?

1698
02:00:14,891 --> 02:00:16,361
Can see sacks.
- What sacks?

1699
02:00:16,441 --> 02:00:17,564
Do not stop talking.

1700
02:00:17,644 --> 02:00:19,170
What else is there?
What is the sound that I hear?

1701
02:00:19,250 --> 02:00:21,818
Can hear train sound.
- Yes. Train is going.

1702
02:00:22,155 --> 02:00:24,888
She is phoning.
- Will kill her.

1703
02:00:25,606 --> 02:00:27,379
But she is pregnant.

1704
02:00:27,560 --> 02:00:29,351
How dare you sympathize with her?

1705
02:00:29,431 --> 02:00:31,133
Jaanu, Bunty is behind you.

1706
02:00:46,080 --> 02:00:47,337
Jaanu!

1707
02:00:53,975 --> 02:00:56,775
Hello father! A problem here.

1708
02:00:57,326 --> 02:00:58,937
Again problem?

1709
02:00:59,488 --> 02:01:01,467
Okay come. I will take care.

1710
02:01:06,331 --> 02:01:07,596
Ji!

1711
02:01:09,402 --> 02:01:13,597
'May 17th 2015.'

1712
02:01:14,710 --> 02:01:20,364
'That was the last
day I saw Janani.'

1713
02:01:21,705 --> 02:01:22,883
Jaanu!

1714
02:01:36,816 --> 02:01:38,320
Jaanu!

1715
02:01:59,390 --> 02:02:00,536
Jaanu!
