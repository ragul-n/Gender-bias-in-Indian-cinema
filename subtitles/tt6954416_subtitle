1
00:00:00,124 --> 00:00:02,840
Smoking and drinking alcohol is
injurious to health.

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:05,948
Smoking and drinking alcohol is
injurious to health.

3
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:15,852
Be quiet. Don't make noise.

4
00:01:16,581 --> 00:01:19,406
Your stick is making
more noise than our slippers.

5
00:01:19,486 --> 00:01:21,325
Oh dear, I forgot.

6
00:01:23,163 --> 00:01:24,839
Now it's okay. Come on.

7
00:01:24,919 --> 00:01:26,892
What's the time?
- 9 O' clock.

8
00:01:26,972 --> 00:01:29,627
How do you know?
- Can't you smell it?

9
00:01:29,845 --> 00:01:32,299
I'm sure 'Prema Nagar'
movie started by now.

10
00:01:32,667 --> 00:01:35,466
I can forget her when I drink,
but she won't let me drink.

11
00:01:35,546 --> 00:01:38,893
I can drink when I forget her,
but she won't let me forget.

12
00:01:40,937 --> 00:01:43,023
Why does Father drink every night?

13
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,453
Because his wife left him.

14
00:01:44,859 --> 00:01:46,372
Why did she leave him?

15
00:01:46,452 --> 00:01:48,630
Because he drinks every night.

16
00:01:51,304 --> 00:01:54,263
Do you think the moon came today?

17
00:01:54,343 --> 00:01:56,736
I don't know.
He didn't tell me anything.

18
00:01:56,816 --> 00:01:58,871
Do you think the moon
is our hostel watchman..

19
00:01:58,951 --> 00:02:00,696
..to tell you before he comes?

20
00:02:06,697 --> 00:02:08,291
I'm scared.

21
00:02:08,371 --> 00:02:11,941
It's okay. Whatever happens..
- You are responsible for it.

22
00:02:12,021 --> 00:02:13,770
Hey!
- Wait for me.

23
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:15,526
I think they are coming
back from tuitions.

24
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:22,350
Is that him?
- No.

25
00:02:24,297 --> 00:02:26,216
This one?
- No, no.

26
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,324
That's him. That's him.
The balloon boy. Catch him.

27
00:02:31,404 --> 00:02:32,811
Get ready.

28
00:02:37,121 --> 00:02:38,486
Hey!

29
00:02:38,566 --> 00:02:41,378
Beat him up. Beat him up.

30
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:44,267
Why are you so confused? Beat him up!

31
00:02:44,347 --> 00:02:46,740
Okay. Okay.
- Beat him up.

32
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:49,078
Stop it!

33
00:02:49,158 --> 00:02:50,591
Why are you beating me?

34
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:52,524
How dare you call my friend blind?

35
00:02:52,604 --> 00:02:54,281
Do you know what she did?

36
00:02:54,361 --> 00:02:55,645
What did she do?

37
00:02:55,725 --> 00:02:57,092
I came to give her chocolates
on my birthday and..

38
00:02:57,172 --> 00:02:58,498
..she said 'I love you' to me.

39
00:02:58,808 --> 00:03:00,092
Is that true?

40
00:03:00,308 --> 00:03:04,957
Actually, I liked his voice..
So I said it.

41
00:03:13,268 --> 00:03:15,201
They say that you
beat him up last night..

42
00:03:15,281 --> 00:03:17,065
..while he was returning
from tuitions. Is that true?

43
00:03:17,145 --> 00:03:20,809
We? Beat him up?
It is clear that they are senseless.

44
00:03:20,998 --> 00:03:22,674
But what happened to your sense?

45
00:03:22,863 --> 00:03:24,890
You know that we bump
into things and fall down..

46
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:27,404
..while walking in the hostel.
Say something.

47
00:03:27,484 --> 00:03:29,740
You think we can go to Tilak Street..
- That's enough.

48
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,707
How do you know it was Tilak Street?

49
00:03:31,787 --> 00:03:33,275
Father mentioned it just now.

50
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:34,431
Me? No.

51
00:03:34,511 --> 00:03:37,534
You said it, Father.
You do this in everything.

52
00:03:37,614 --> 00:03:39,988
You brought me slippers
of two different sizes.

53
00:03:40,068 --> 00:03:41,258
Show me.

54
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,785
You wore Adilaxmi's
slipper on one foot.

55
00:03:43,865 --> 00:03:45,758
Adilaxmi!

56
00:03:45,974 --> 00:03:48,028
Why is she shouting on
her when it is her mistake?

57
00:03:48,108 --> 00:03:50,001
She is like that. She's a devil.

58
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:51,636
What is this nonsense, dad?

59
00:03:51,716 --> 00:03:54,226
Father, he is an idiot.
- Say it now.

60
00:03:54,306 --> 00:03:55,771
Father, he is an idiot.

61
00:03:55,851 --> 00:03:58,528
Uncle, do you know what your son did?

62
00:03:58,608 --> 00:04:01,512
He gave me chocolates
on his birthday..

63
00:04:01,592 --> 00:04:02,852
..and said 'I love you' to me.

64
00:04:02,932 --> 00:04:04,874
No, dad. I said 'I hate you' to her.

65
00:04:04,954 --> 00:04:07,501
See that?
He is changing his words before you.

66
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:09,060
He must have said the
same thing to many others.

67
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:11,049
Maybe one of them beat him up.

68
00:04:11,129 --> 00:04:14,044
Idiot! You are still a kid!
You want girls and love already?

69
00:04:14,124 --> 00:04:16,303
I will teach you a lesson at home.
I'm sorry, sir.

70
00:04:16,382 --> 00:04:19,763
Let's go, you idiot! Let's go!
- Ouch! Why are you beating me, dad?

71
00:04:19,844 --> 00:04:22,289
Tell me the truth.
You guys did this, right?

72
00:04:22,369 --> 00:04:24,657
Is it true that you
drank last night, Father?

73
00:04:25,857 --> 00:04:27,360
That's not true. That's a lie.

74
00:04:27,543 --> 00:04:28,646
Then this is a lie too.

75
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:30,322
You idiots..

76
00:05:05,678 --> 00:05:09,664
"Black darkness is
spread before our eyes."

77
00:05:09,854 --> 00:05:13,854
"But our hearts as
pure as white snow."

78
00:05:13,934 --> 00:05:18,016
"Our smiles are as
green as tender leaves."

79
00:05:18,096 --> 00:05:22,097
"Our friendship shines
bright as the yellow sun."

80
00:05:22,327 --> 00:05:30,516
"There are many colors in
us if you see with your heart."

81
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:38,462
"Let's run wild with
our hearts full of joy."

82
00:05:38,542 --> 00:05:42,813
"Let's do mischief and
watch the wonders unfold."

83
00:05:42,893 --> 00:05:44,935
"We don't have
blindfolds on our eyes."

84
00:05:46,962 --> 00:05:51,137
"Let's flap our colorful
wings and touch the stars."

85
00:05:51,327 --> 00:05:55,219
"We don't have boundaries
to our sights."

86
00:06:07,962 --> 00:06:12,029
I cooked it myself.
Eat and tell me how it is.

87
00:06:12,488 --> 00:06:15,015
It is good. But if you add salt..

88
00:06:15,095 --> 00:06:17,474
It will be even better.

89
00:06:17,718 --> 00:06:19,420
Sorry, I forgot.

90
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,623
I will ask you something,
you answer me honestly.

91
00:06:21,703 --> 00:06:23,623
What will you become if
you are able to see in the future?

92
00:06:23,853 --> 00:06:25,677
I will become a doctor, Father.

93
00:06:26,163 --> 00:06:30,150
Oh. Doctors should prescribe
medicines, not drink alcohol.

94
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:32,677
I will become an engineer, Father.

95
00:06:32,907 --> 00:06:34,474
I will become a good police officer..

96
00:06:34,691 --> 00:06:37,258
..and arrest everybody
that drinks at night.

97
00:06:38,123 --> 00:06:39,556
People who drink and drive?
- Yes.

98
00:06:39,745 --> 00:06:43,853
But I don't drive after I drink.
- But you oversee the hostel.

99
00:06:46,761 --> 00:06:48,578
Gautham, what will you become?

100
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:50,134
I will see, Father.

101
00:06:50,214 --> 00:06:52,016
See? What will you see?

102
00:06:52,096 --> 00:06:54,373
They say that Taj Mahal
is a symbol of love.

103
00:06:54,453 --> 00:06:56,352
I will see how it looks.

104
00:06:57,725 --> 00:06:59,908
I will see the sunrise in Kanyakumari.

105
00:07:01,357 --> 00:07:03,130
I will see the sunset in Goa.

106
00:07:04,917 --> 00:07:06,247
I will see Prince
Mahesh Babu's movie..

107
00:07:06,327 --> 00:07:07,923
..first day, first show.

108
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,243
There is no problem in your eyes.
Why did you consult me?

109
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:39,356
But my eyes are my problem, doctor.
Remove them.

110
00:07:39,436 --> 00:07:41,283
What?
- You heard me right.

111
00:07:41,363 --> 00:07:42,818
I came here to get my eyes removed.

112
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:45,153
I beg of you. Remove them, doctor.

113
00:07:45,233 --> 00:07:48,126
Hey! They are not teeth
filled with cavities..

114
00:07:48,206 --> 00:07:50,904
..or stones in your
kidneys to get them removed.

115
00:07:51,163 --> 00:07:53,887
They are eyes.
They are a gift from god.

116
00:07:53,967 --> 00:07:55,390
They are a gift to everybody else.

117
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:57,509
But for me they are a curse.

118
00:07:58,028 --> 00:08:01,747
Ever since I was born,
I was eager to get my eyesight.

119
00:08:02,018 --> 00:08:05,564
But ever since I got my sight,
I'm wishing I remained blind.

120
00:08:05,644 --> 00:08:07,488
What is the problem that
has you so disheartened?

121
00:08:07,661 --> 00:08:09,293
What is your sorrow?

122
00:08:09,373 --> 00:08:12,029
You won't believe me, doctor.
You will think I'm mad.

123
00:08:12,109 --> 00:08:14,234
That's what I think
of you now as well.

124
00:08:14,314 --> 00:08:15,918
First tell me your problem.

125
00:08:15,998 --> 00:08:18,924
Then I will decide what
you should do. Tell me.

126
00:08:20,091 --> 00:08:22,362
I had no eyesight
two years back, doctor.

127
00:08:23,761 --> 00:08:25,318
But I used to live like a king.

128
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:47,998
'If I help him cross the
road and upload that photo..'

129
00:08:48,078 --> 00:08:49,436
'..on Facebook, I'll get many likes.'

130
00:08:50,549 --> 00:08:51,987
Come, I will help you cross the road.

131
00:08:52,067 --> 00:08:54,041
Did I ask for help?
Did I ask for help?

132
00:08:54,121 --> 00:08:55,728
You want to upload this
pic on Facebook, right?

133
00:08:55,808 --> 00:08:57,501
Don't play these tricks with me.

134
00:08:57,581 --> 00:08:59,966
Did I get ready so well
to get help from you? - Okay.

135
00:09:00,046 --> 00:09:03,303
Some lucky girl will
help me cross the road.

136
00:09:07,741 --> 00:09:11,778
Desire.
- "I am waiting for you, baby."

137
00:09:11,858 --> 00:09:16,228
She is here.
- "I am waiting for you, baby."

138
00:09:16,417 --> 00:09:19,561
Wow, she is beautiful.
- "I am waiting for you, baby."

139
00:09:20,264 --> 00:09:21,583
She is mine.

140
00:09:23,118 --> 00:09:27,096
Supriya! Supriya!
Will you help me cross the road?

141
00:09:27,176 --> 00:09:28,963
Is that my every day job?

142
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:30,931
Nobody here has humanity.

143
00:09:31,011 --> 00:09:32,856
I've been standing here
for the past half hour.

144
00:09:33,029 --> 00:09:34,520
Nobody offered to
help me cross the road.

145
00:09:35,191 --> 00:09:37,893
So, please..
- Come on.

146
00:09:38,769 --> 00:09:40,228
How do you know my name?

147
00:09:40,434 --> 00:09:42,878
I can tell your measurements
too if you have no objection.

148
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:44,431
No need.
- I was just joking.

149
00:09:44,511 --> 00:09:45,966
Idiot.
- 'He is too smart.'

150
00:09:46,046 --> 00:09:47,263
Supriya!
- Hmm?

151
00:09:47,343 --> 00:09:49,371
What do you feel when
we walk seven steps..

152
00:09:49,451 --> 00:09:51,090
..holding each other's hands like this?
- What?

153
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:53,382
She feels that she is helping
a blind man cross the road.

154
00:09:53,462 --> 00:09:55,028
Why are you still here?

155
00:09:55,108 --> 00:09:56,206
Why are you still here?
- I'm leaving.

156
00:09:56,286 --> 00:09:57,352
Supriya!
- Hmm?

157
00:09:57,525 --> 00:09:59,363
You don't have a boyfriend, right?
- How do you know?

158
00:09:59,443 --> 00:10:01,168
If you had a boyfriend,
you would be on his bike..

159
00:10:01,248 --> 00:10:02,487
..not at the bus stop.

160
00:10:03,654 --> 00:10:05,384
I earn 18,000 a month.

161
00:10:05,464 --> 00:10:07,697
After all the deductions
I get 15,000 rupees in hand.

162
00:10:07,777 --> 00:10:10,335
I already applied in a
couple of hospitals for my eyes.

163
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:13,070
If someone dies I will
get a call immediately..

164
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:14,346
..and I will get a pair of eyes.

165
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,782
Recently I paid two
chits in Sriram Chits.

166
00:10:16,862 --> 00:10:18,653
One for 50,000 and
the other for 20,000.

167
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,717
If you agree, I'll use
the first one for our wedding..

168
00:10:20,797 --> 00:10:23,939
..and the second one for
our honeymoon. Should I do that?

169
00:10:24,019 --> 00:10:26,963
I help you cross the
road as an act of kindness.

170
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:29,635
If you cross your limits,
I will push you under a truck.

171
00:10:29,715 --> 00:10:30,986
You will die instantly.

172
00:10:31,235 --> 00:10:34,586
Oh, really? That's fantastic,
marvelous and barbarous.

173
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:35,765
Thank you very much.

174
00:10:35,845 --> 00:10:36,921
Idiot!

175
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,500
Useless life!

176
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,013
What did you say to that girl?
Why did she leave?

177
00:10:40,093 --> 00:10:42,468
She proposed, but I rejected her.
- You rejected her?

178
00:10:42,548 --> 00:10:44,372
Don't be so shocked. We will
be late for the show. Let's go.

179
00:10:44,452 --> 00:10:45,442
Hop on.

180
00:10:48,101 --> 00:10:52,198
Good morning, Vizag!

181
00:10:52,278 --> 00:10:55,096
You are listening to Radio
2.7 Big FM 'Listen, Play, Live.'

182
00:10:55,176 --> 00:10:56,743
I'm Love Doctor Gautham.

183
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:58,116
Are you facing problems in love?

184
00:10:58,196 --> 00:10:59,738
Don't you have the courage
to propose to someone?

185
00:10:59,818 --> 00:11:01,240
Then call me immediately.

186
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,494
I will show the right
path for your love.

187
00:11:02,574 --> 00:11:03,824
He can't see his own path.

188
00:11:04,099 --> 00:11:06,510
He says he will show the
path to others. What is this crap?

189
00:11:10,715 --> 00:11:11,785
Hello! Who is this?

190
00:11:11,865 --> 00:11:14,543
My name is Swapna.
I'm so happy to talk to you, Gautham.

191
00:11:14,623 --> 00:11:15,613
I'm happy too.

192
00:11:15,693 --> 00:11:17,592
Gautham, I've a small
problem in my love life.

193
00:11:17,672 --> 00:11:20,110
Don't worry. The solution is in my pocket.
- Really?

194
00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:22,199
You say you are in love,
did you see the Taj Mahal?

195
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:23,215
Did he see it?

196
00:11:23,295 --> 00:11:27,777
I saw it 25 times. In fact,
I see it in a new light every time.

197
00:11:27,983 --> 00:11:29,467
What is he talking about?

198
00:11:29,547 --> 00:11:31,045
Does he even know how it looks?

199
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,385
Why do you care?

200
00:11:32,465 --> 00:11:33,834
Okay, Swapna. What is your problem?

201
00:11:33,914 --> 00:11:36,321
I'm afraid to propose to my cousin.
Please help me.

202
00:11:36,401 --> 00:11:38,148
Definitely.
There's only one rule to this.

203
00:11:38,228 --> 00:11:40,613
Go to him,
close your eyes and tell him.

204
00:11:40,693 --> 00:11:42,051
Close your eyes?
- Yes.

205
00:11:42,131 --> 00:11:43,629
Because if you close your eyes,
it will be dark.

206
00:11:43,709 --> 00:11:44,343
If it is dark,
you will get the courage.

207
00:11:44,423 --> 00:11:45,099
And if you get the courage,
you will be reckless.

208
00:11:45,179 --> 00:11:46,408
And recklessness is
a very thrilling thing.

209
00:11:46,488 --> 00:11:48,721
Rubbish! He is talking
from his own experience.

210
00:11:48,801 --> 00:11:50,757
He can be so positive
about his problems.

211
00:11:50,837 --> 00:11:52,378
Okay, Swapna. All the best!

212
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:54,951
I'm playing a lovely
song for all of you. Enjoy.

213
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,670
Now watch me.

214
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:05,437
How did he jump like that?

215
00:12:07,145 --> 00:12:08,248
Who kept this bottle here?

216
00:12:10,594 --> 00:12:11,772
Look where he hit me.

217
00:12:11,852 --> 00:12:13,924
It's okay. He is blind.

218
00:12:14,821 --> 00:12:16,310
How did you know that
he wanted to trip you?

219
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:18,764
He never washes his socks.

220
00:12:20,635 --> 00:12:21,889
Hello?

221
00:12:24,593 --> 00:12:25,716
Thank you, sir. I'm coming.

222
00:12:25,796 --> 00:12:27,565
Buddy, there's a heart
attack patient at the hospital.

223
00:12:27,645 --> 00:12:29,629
I might get my eyes if he dies. Let's go.
- Really? Come on.

224
00:12:31,911 --> 00:12:33,230
Not that way, this way.

225
00:12:33,532 --> 00:12:35,835
Why did you buy such a big garland?
Isn't it too much?

226
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:38,094
He is going to give me his eyes.

227
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:40,840
Not just a buy garland,
I can even hoist a flag in his honor.

228
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:41,889
But he should die first.

229
00:12:42,105 --> 00:12:45,986
Oh, Jesus!
How can I live without Thomas?

230
00:12:46,354 --> 00:12:47,576
I think he died.

231
00:12:47,656 --> 00:12:48,732
Come on, let's comfort her.

232
00:12:48,812 --> 00:12:50,159
How can I live?

233
00:12:53,457 --> 00:12:56,300
Auntie, past is past.
We can do nothing to change it.

234
00:12:56,473 --> 00:12:57,598
Think about the future now.

235
00:12:57,678 --> 00:12:59,046
If we can order a coffin,
we can pack uncle's body..

236
00:12:59,126 --> 00:13:00,863
..after removing his eyes.

237
00:13:00,943 --> 00:13:02,770
Hey! What are you talking, man?

238
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:03,959
He is undergoing a surgery.

239
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:05,537
Uncle is still alive?

240
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:07,170
Oh God! Auntie!

241
00:13:07,678 --> 00:13:09,245
Be quiet.

242
00:13:09,418 --> 00:13:10,618
Oh my God!
- Sorry, auntie.

243
00:13:10,698 --> 00:13:12,559
Auntie, how long
have you been married?

244
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,342
We aren't married yet.
We are still living together.

245
00:13:16,525 --> 00:13:18,093
We'll get married very soon.

246
00:13:18,173 --> 00:13:19,434
What will they do after
getting married at this age?

247
00:13:19,514 --> 00:13:21,401
That is not our concern. Auntie!
- Yes?

248
00:13:21,481 --> 00:13:22,644
Does uncle have eyesight problems?

249
00:13:22,724 --> 00:13:24,849
No. He doesn't use specs.

250
00:13:25,055 --> 00:13:26,914
He can thread a needle in a second.

251
00:13:26,994 --> 00:13:29,630
Wow! I can wait all day for such eyes.

252
00:13:29,814 --> 00:13:31,425
My God! Sit down. Sit down.

253
00:13:31,505 --> 00:13:32,755
Oh, Jesus.

254
00:13:33,717 --> 00:13:36,095
Jesus, if you quickly
finish this case..

255
00:13:36,175 --> 00:13:37,900
..I'll come to the church
and light 100 candles.

256
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:42,696
Oh, God! I will light 10,000
candles if you save Thomas.

257
00:13:42,776 --> 00:13:45,107
Ignore that, Jesus.
If I get my eyesight..

258
00:13:45,187 --> 00:13:46,620
..I will directly
come to Medak Church.

259
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,966
I will directly come to Jerusalem.

260
00:13:49,046 --> 00:13:51,960
Why? Why don't you
two go to Him directly?

261
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,744
God bless my Thomas.

262
00:13:54,122 --> 00:13:55,927
Nothing to worry. He is out of danger.

263
00:13:56,652 --> 00:13:57,884
Thank you, doctor.

264
00:13:57,964 --> 00:14:01,290
My son, Thomas is alive.
Let us go and see him.

265
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:03,711
I can't see. First you go and see him.

266
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:05,084
Thank you, Jesus.

267
00:14:05,164 --> 00:14:07,214
Happy married life.
- Hey!

268
00:14:14,383 --> 00:14:15,940
God!

269
00:14:16,178 --> 00:14:18,729
All these years I thought
I don't have eyes.

270
00:14:18,979 --> 00:14:20,947
But I just realized
that you don't have ears.

271
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:26,081
What's wrong? He gave us chips to eat
and beer to drink.

272
00:14:26,161 --> 00:14:29,335
I see. Are you upset that
He didn't give you pickle to lick?

273
00:14:29,415 --> 00:14:30,730
Shut up!

274
00:14:31,097 --> 00:14:34,156
I've been praying to Him for 25 years.
Can't He hear me?

275
00:14:34,696 --> 00:14:37,551
I don't have any big dreams.

276
00:14:38,274 --> 00:14:42,555
One girl, two eyes,
three kids and 60 years of life.

277
00:14:42,761 --> 00:14:45,150
But even these small wishes
are not coming true. Darn.

278
00:14:47,172 --> 00:14:48,901
Do you know something?
- What is that?

279
00:14:48,981 --> 00:14:50,317
That girl this morning..

280
00:14:50,397 --> 00:14:51,560
That one you rejected?

281
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,427
She rejected me.
- Oh God!

282
00:14:54,507 --> 00:14:58,763
Not just her,
many girls left me because I'm blind.

283
00:14:59,054 --> 00:15:01,973
We can't see if we are blind..

284
00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:03,681
..but who says we can't love someone?

285
00:15:03,761 --> 00:15:07,908
Nonsense. Gaining eyesight
is not in our hands.

286
00:15:08,189 --> 00:15:10,578
But invoking love in
someone is in our hands.

287
00:15:10,762 --> 00:15:15,297
Yes. See a girl's heart,
not her beauty.

288
00:15:15,594 --> 00:15:18,189
Then, your life will be good.
- Come near.

289
00:15:19,302 --> 00:15:23,308
I can't even see the person,
how can I see the heart?

290
00:15:23,388 --> 00:15:27,005
That's very easy.
Generally girls with good hearts..

291
00:15:27,085 --> 00:15:29,762
..place their hands around
a lamp to protect it from wind..

292
00:15:29,842 --> 00:15:33,156
..place dolls in the hands of street
children while they are asleep..

293
00:15:33,236 --> 00:15:37,693
..in one word,
girls who help others willingly.

294
00:15:37,773 --> 00:15:41,877
One of those girls can
bring light to your life.

295
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:47,317
Two, not one.
We should have four pegs.

296
00:15:47,512 --> 00:15:50,106
They may close the Janatha
Bar before we reach.

297
00:15:50,387 --> 00:15:51,782
First start the bike.
- Okay.

298
00:15:55,844 --> 00:15:57,671
Hey, what's wrong?

299
00:15:57,751 --> 00:16:00,428
The bike is giving me trouble.
Let me check.

300
00:16:14,589 --> 00:16:15,519
Excuse me!

301
00:16:16,905 --> 00:16:17,889
Any problem?

302
00:16:18,072 --> 00:16:19,370
Do you want a ride?

303
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:24,224
In one word,
girls who help others willingly.

304
00:16:24,304 --> 00:16:26,040
Thanks. Let's go.

305
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,293
What about my bike?
- Stay here and get it in the morning.

306
00:16:28,373 --> 00:16:29,433
No.

307
00:16:29,513 --> 00:16:31,401
Come on.
- Hello!

308
00:16:33,206 --> 00:16:34,525
Oh dear!
- Buddy!

309
00:16:34,605 --> 00:16:36,557
Very nice.
Is the car color your choice?

310
00:16:36,637 --> 00:16:37,444
Yes.

311
00:16:38,016 --> 00:16:39,022
I love this color.

312
00:16:39,102 --> 00:16:40,633
Oh.
- Which color is this?

313
00:16:40,713 --> 00:16:42,608
I will tell you in the room. Let's go.

314
00:16:43,354 --> 00:16:44,240
Sit behind.

315
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,516
This is behind. Maybe he
thinks this is the front seat.

316
00:16:49,538 --> 00:16:51,321
Where do you have to go?
- Janatha Bar.

317
00:16:51,401 --> 00:16:52,359
What?

318
00:16:52,439 --> 00:16:54,035
Drop us at Gajuvaka Central.

319
00:16:54,115 --> 00:16:55,386
You both had drinks, right?

320
00:16:55,743 --> 00:16:57,615
We drank Thumbs Up.

321
00:16:57,695 --> 00:16:58,804
Did you mix whiskey with it?

322
00:16:58,988 --> 00:17:00,653
Did you mix alcohol in it?
- No.

323
00:17:00,733 --> 00:17:01,809
No, he didn't.

324
00:17:01,889 --> 00:17:03,528
Look, don't pretend before me.

325
00:17:03,745 --> 00:17:06,347
If you drink and drive,
you'll put yourselves..

326
00:17:06,426 --> 00:17:08,603
..and others in danger.
That's why I offered you a ride.

327
00:17:08,834 --> 00:17:10,861
She is a girl with a good heart.

328
00:17:10,941 --> 00:17:12,198
Did you notice it too?

329
00:17:12,278 --> 00:17:13,563
What will you get by drinking alcohol?

330
00:17:13,752 --> 00:17:15,320
Drink water instead of beer.

331
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,982
Drink pineapple juice instead of wine.

332
00:17:17,061 --> 00:17:21,391
Sister! Beer is 80% water.
Wine is 70% juice.

333
00:17:21,472 --> 00:17:22,555
That's why we drank it. Is it wrong?

334
00:17:22,635 --> 00:17:24,649
Yes, it is wrong. She said so.

335
00:17:25,163 --> 00:17:26,947
We are very sorry.

336
00:17:27,027 --> 00:17:29,609
I understood your problem.
I have a good idea..

337
00:17:29,689 --> 00:17:30,919
..to help you to stop drinking.

338
00:17:30,999 --> 00:17:32,176
What is that?

339
00:17:32,256 --> 00:17:33,881
In order to kill a bad habit..

340
00:17:33,961 --> 00:17:36,746
..you need to shift to a good habit.
- Oh.

341
00:17:36,953 --> 00:17:38,910
In the same way,
if you want to stop drinking..

342
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:40,553
..find a good girl and love her.

343
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:43,959
Then all your
concentration on drinking..

344
00:17:44,187 --> 00:17:45,484
..will be diverted to love.

345
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,192
Done.
- Huh?

346
00:17:47,272 --> 00:17:49,105
Done.
- Looks like he fell for her.

347
00:17:49,387 --> 00:17:51,339
Sister! You are
digging your own grave.

348
00:17:51,419 --> 00:17:53,468
What?
- He is drunk.

349
00:17:53,548 --> 00:17:55,328
Shut up.
You continue.

350
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:59,847
If you feel like drinking,
close your eyes and think of her.

351
00:17:59,927 --> 00:18:01,436
You will never touch
alcohol in your life again.

352
00:18:01,516 --> 00:18:02,854
This idea is superb.

353
00:18:04,551 --> 00:18:07,665
You destination is here.
- Oh God! So soon?

354
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:10,800
We should've said Steel Plant.
- Or Amaravati. Get down.

355
00:18:11,399 --> 00:18:12,167
You drive well.
- Thank you.

356
00:18:12,247 --> 00:18:13,507
It's okay.

357
00:18:16,718 --> 00:18:18,426
Thanks. Bye.

358
00:18:18,685 --> 00:18:20,534
Bye. Remember us.

359
00:18:21,042 --> 00:18:22,426
She is a good girl.

360
00:18:23,151 --> 00:18:24,773
Hey.. Note the car number.
Note it down.

361
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:26,276
I noted it. But why?

362
00:18:26,356 --> 00:18:28,365
To fall in love.
- To fall in love?

363
00:18:28,445 --> 00:18:29,489
Yes.

364
00:18:29,824 --> 00:18:32,646
Girls reject me because
I'm blind, right?

365
00:18:32,726 --> 00:18:34,971
So I will approach
her as if I'm normal and..

366
00:18:35,188 --> 00:18:36,939
..make her fall in love with me.
- How will you do that?

367
00:18:37,144 --> 00:18:39,793
I will tell you.
But I want full details about..

368
00:18:39,873 --> 00:18:40,999
..her office,
the place where she has coffee..

369
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:43,034
..and the park that
she goes for jogging.

370
00:18:48,097 --> 00:18:49,697
Why did you bring me to a hospital?

371
00:18:49,924 --> 00:18:51,309
Did someone die to give me his eyes?

372
00:18:51,389 --> 00:18:52,887
You will die if I tell you the reason.

373
00:18:52,967 --> 00:18:54,628
She works as an eye
doctor in this hospital.

374
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:57,201
She is an eye doctor
and I'm a love doctor.

375
00:18:57,281 --> 00:18:58,779
We are a family of doctors.

376
00:18:58,974 --> 00:19:00,768
As if you studied MBBS.
Do you think it is possible..

377
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,006
..for a blind man to convince
an eye doctor otherwise..

378
00:19:02,086 --> 00:19:02,936
..and make her fall in love?

379
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:05,552
Stop your nonsense.
You will see it with your own eyes.

380
00:19:05,632 --> 00:19:08,546
Don't worry. First give me
the blueprints of this hospital.

381
00:19:08,741 --> 00:19:11,206
This hospital is spread
across 5 acres of land.

382
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,838
I got it.

383
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,476
The mortuary is to the right
and the pharmacy is to the left.

384
00:19:19,556 --> 00:19:21,940
Now I'll go to the pharmacy
and buy a Crocin tablet.

385
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,238
Superb.
- Watch me.

386
00:19:23,318 --> 00:19:24,923
Move aside.
- Be careful.

387
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,596
Oh God!

388
00:19:33,109 --> 00:19:34,958
Sorry, sir.
- Watch where you are going.

389
00:19:35,942 --> 00:19:38,450
Oh God!
- Hey, get up.

390
00:19:39,672 --> 00:19:41,034
Who kept a dustbin here?

391
00:19:41,114 --> 00:19:42,742
The doctors kept it here
as a part of 'Clean India' program.

392
00:19:42,822 --> 00:19:44,655
Do you want the details now? Let's go.

393
00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:51,326
This is the hospital canteen.
Don't move until I tell you to.

394
00:19:51,406 --> 00:19:53,115
She comes here for lunch every day.

395
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,388
Let's practice, okay?

396
00:20:07,604 --> 00:20:08,739
Okay?
- Done.

397
00:20:09,323 --> 00:20:10,437
Hey!

398
00:20:16,012 --> 00:20:17,309
Hey!

399
00:20:19,395 --> 00:20:20,574
Sorry, sir.

400
00:20:23,028 --> 00:20:24,768
Your love story will
be the cause of my death.

401
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:28,586
Madam, see these reports.

402
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:29,926
Keep them in my room.
I will check them later.

403
00:20:30,006 --> 00:20:31,397
Okay, madam.

404
00:20:33,645 --> 00:20:34,791
Hello, mom!

405
00:20:34,871 --> 00:20:37,535
Nethra, your dad selected
a marriage alliance for you.

406
00:20:37,615 --> 00:20:39,805
The boy will come to
the hospital canteen today.

407
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:41,005
Meet him.

408
00:20:41,085 --> 00:20:43,535
Is this necessary now?
I'm not interested.

409
00:20:43,751 --> 00:20:45,643
Why are you so scared of marriage?

410
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:48,327
Do you love anybody?
Just tell me, I will help you.

411
00:20:48,662 --> 00:20:49,776
Shut up!
- Give it to me.

412
00:20:50,089 --> 00:20:52,749
Look, Nethra. You have
to meet the boy today. - Mom!

413
00:20:52,829 --> 00:20:55,246
Otherwise I'll be
in trouble with your dad.

414
00:20:55,326 --> 00:20:56,662
Okay.

415
00:20:58,631 --> 00:20:59,842
I'm tense.

416
00:21:02,836 --> 00:21:05,496
Understood? I'm perfect.

417
00:21:07,431 --> 00:21:09,831
Secret Temptation. She is here.

418
00:21:11,799 --> 00:21:13,420
You are more dangerous
than a dog squad.

419
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,523
Hey!
- Yes?

420
00:21:14,603 --> 00:21:15,993
You stay connected with Bluetooth.

421
00:21:16,073 --> 00:21:17,723
If I do something wrong..
- Should I run away?

422
00:21:17,803 --> 00:21:19,507
Inform me.
- Okay.

423
00:21:19,587 --> 00:21:21,033
Now maintain distance.
- Okay, bye.

424
00:21:25,769 --> 00:21:28,017
Hi, good morning.
I'm your love doctor Gautham.

425
00:21:28,097 --> 00:21:29,023
I'm here.
- Why?

426
00:21:29,103 --> 00:21:30,074
She is long gone.

427
00:21:30,154 --> 00:21:31,457
You can start your FM program there.
Let's go.

428
00:21:31,537 --> 00:21:32,355
Where did she go?

429
00:21:32,435 --> 00:21:33,511
There.
- Where?

430
00:21:33,591 --> 00:21:34,735
To the canteen.

431
00:21:40,476 --> 00:21:41,471
Nethra?

432
00:21:42,022 --> 00:21:45,049
Rajesh. Since my parents
selected this alliance..

433
00:21:45,222 --> 00:21:46,536
..I thought you'll
be a plain looking girl.

434
00:21:46,855 --> 00:21:48,569
You are hot.

435
00:21:49,607 --> 00:21:51,098
What? Are you shocked?

436
00:21:51,844 --> 00:21:54,655
I'm very open.
I like people who are open.

437
00:21:54,735 --> 00:21:57,293
If we want to become close,
first we should open up.

438
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,033
How do I look?
Give me an honest reply.

439
00:21:59,113 --> 00:22:00,244
You are very black.

440
00:22:00,324 --> 00:22:02,796
Black? Black?
Do you think black is cheap?

441
00:22:02,876 --> 00:22:04,996
You like black money,
but you don't like a black man.

442
00:22:05,245 --> 00:22:06,834
Sorry.

443
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:10,802
Oh no, come on, control Rajesh.

444
00:22:11,299 --> 00:22:13,699
It's okay.
Be open with me. I won't mind.

445
00:22:15,915 --> 00:22:17,342
Order, sir.
- Huh?

446
00:22:18,336 --> 00:22:20,401
Openly tell him what you want.

447
00:22:20,617 --> 00:22:22,185
One chocolate with ice-cream.

448
00:22:22,265 --> 00:22:24,369
Chocolate?
Chocolate? Are you a small kid?

449
00:22:24,563 --> 00:22:26,336
Will you die if you don't eat it?
Order something else.

450
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:31,633
One chocolate ice-cream
with two spoons.

451
00:22:31,713 --> 00:22:33,957
Okay, sir.
- You are..

452
00:22:34,037 --> 00:22:35,721
Didn't you openly
tell him about me yet?

453
00:22:35,801 --> 00:22:37,278
She is to your right.

454
00:22:37,358 --> 00:22:38,982
I'm asking you.
- What is he doing here?

455
00:22:39,062 --> 00:22:40,981
Hi. I'm Gautham. I'm her boyfriend.

456
00:22:42,213 --> 00:22:43,662
Their parents didn't
agree to our marriage.

457
00:22:43,742 --> 00:22:46,048
But their refusal didn't
stop our love, bro.

458
00:22:46,128 --> 00:22:49,345
I'm a very open person like you.

459
00:22:49,583 --> 00:22:52,870
I heard that you are
going to marry her. Congrats.

460
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:54,547
I'm not saying this because
she is my girlfriend..

461
00:22:54,627 --> 00:22:56,017
..but she is very caring, bro.

462
00:22:56,374 --> 00:22:58,277
Once when I had fever,
she stayed in my house..

463
00:22:58,461 --> 00:23:00,526
..for five days, you know.
- Me?

464
00:23:00,753 --> 00:23:01,985
Five days?

465
00:23:02,158 --> 00:23:04,180
Openly. She told her
parents that she is..

466
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,385
..going on a botanical tour.

467
00:23:05,688 --> 00:23:08,856
That reminds me, she loves Goa, bro.

468
00:23:09,753 --> 00:23:11,353
She stops talking to
me if I don't take her there..

469
00:23:11,433 --> 00:23:12,466
..every three months.

470
00:23:13,677 --> 00:23:15,688
This is all a part of my plan.
Don't worry.

471
00:23:16,632 --> 00:23:18,448
After your marriage,
all three of us can plan a trip.

472
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:20,924
Three of us?
- Yes.

473
00:23:21,004 --> 00:23:23,445
You can openly continue
as her husband before others.

474
00:23:23,525 --> 00:23:26,299
I will be her boyfriend
when nobody is around.

475
00:23:26,379 --> 00:23:29,391
Disgusting. I've never
heard worse words than these.

476
00:23:29,471 --> 00:23:30,505
Think about it, bro.

477
00:23:30,585 --> 00:23:33,575
Shut up. It is so gross
that I can't even imagine it.

478
00:23:34,407 --> 00:23:37,713
I said I'm an open man,
but not so open. I'm leaving.

479
00:23:37,793 --> 00:23:39,918
Bro! Just think about it once.
- Shut up.

480
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:44,123
Thanks, you helped me a lot.
- It's okay.

481
00:23:44,203 --> 00:23:45,987
How did you know about my problem?

482
00:23:46,067 --> 00:23:47,890
I heard you on the
phone a few minutes back.

483
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:50,372
Oh, okay. What brings you here?

484
00:23:50,452 --> 00:23:53,572
You told me to find
a good girl and love her. - Yes.

485
00:23:53,652 --> 00:23:55,961
So, I came to find someone here.

486
00:23:57,474 --> 00:23:58,761
She got up.

487
00:23:58,841 --> 00:24:00,967
You saved me. Thank you.

488
00:24:02,491 --> 00:24:04,264
By the way, I'm Nethra.

489
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:07,345
She wants to shake hands with you.

490
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:31,847
"For the first time ever,
my heartbeat says I love you."

491
00:24:32,117 --> 00:24:36,798
"For the first time ever,
my pulse-rate is not in control."

492
00:24:37,144 --> 00:24:41,987
"For the first time ever,
there is sunrise in my life."

493
00:24:42,258 --> 00:24:46,398
"For the first time ever,
I like my life because of you."

494
00:24:46,478 --> 00:24:51,480
"I lost my mind. I became crazy."

495
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:56,852
"I lost my mind.
I can't sleep anymore."

496
00:24:56,932 --> 00:25:01,608
"I lost my mind.
My heart is beating rapidly."

497
00:25:01,688 --> 00:25:07,144
"I lost my mind.
My life has a meaning now."

498
00:25:07,446 --> 00:25:12,203
"For the first time ever,
my heartbeat says I love you."

499
00:25:12,538 --> 00:25:17,295
"For the first time ever,
my pulse-rate is not in control."

500
00:25:17,375 --> 00:25:20,019
"She's really super,
I'm in a stupor.."

501
00:25:20,099 --> 00:25:22,625
"..she has made me an
offer and changed my future."

502
00:25:22,705 --> 00:25:25,090
"Everything is set, this
is the beginning of my love story.."

503
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:27,890
"..my life will be a helicopter
ride after my marriage."

504
00:25:47,922 --> 00:25:50,376
"I was searching for a torch light.."

505
00:25:50,456 --> 00:25:52,851
"..and you found me like a satellite."

506
00:25:53,025 --> 00:25:57,954
"I was lost and you came
to me like a Google map."

507
00:25:58,034 --> 00:26:00,495
"One touch from you
and my heart is singing.."

508
00:26:00,575 --> 00:26:02,927
"..a love song in high pitch."

509
00:26:03,007 --> 00:26:05,500
"One word from you and
my heart soars like a kite.."

510
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:09,769
"..revolving around you."

511
00:26:09,942 --> 00:26:14,883
"I lost my mind. I became crazy."

512
00:26:14,963 --> 00:26:19,921
"I lost my mind.
I can't sleep anymore."

513
00:26:20,224 --> 00:26:25,013
"I lost my mind.
My heart is beating rapidly."

514
00:26:25,093 --> 00:26:30,516
"I lost my mind.
My life has a meaning now."

515
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:56,061
"You filled my body
with your flavor.."

516
00:26:56,141 --> 00:26:58,548
"..as if I've been dipped
in a perfumed river."

517
00:26:58,628 --> 00:27:03,553
"You occupied my mind
like a high-beam light."

518
00:27:03,633 --> 00:27:08,591
"You made me hot with just one smile."

519
00:27:08,671 --> 00:27:11,186
"As if luck came
knocking on my door.."

520
00:27:11,266 --> 00:27:15,468
"..you held my hand,
walked with me, changed my fate."

521
00:27:15,548 --> 00:27:20,581
"I lost my mind. I became crazy."

522
00:27:20,661 --> 00:27:25,845
"I lost my mind.
I can't sleep anymore."

523
00:27:25,925 --> 00:27:30,613
"I lost my mind.
My heart is beating rapidly."

524
00:27:30,693 --> 00:27:36,202
"I lost my mind.
My life has a meaning now."

525
00:27:36,451 --> 00:27:41,272
"For the first time ever,
my heartbeat says I love you."

526
00:27:41,619 --> 00:27:46,851
"For the first time ever,
my pulse-rate is not in control."

527
00:27:48,492 --> 00:27:51,767
Good morning, Vizag!
If you get hurt, consult a doctor.

528
00:27:51,847 --> 00:27:54,459
If your heart is hurt,
consult this love doctor.

529
00:27:54,665 --> 00:27:56,697
I will play a lovely
song for you now. Enjoy.

530
00:27:57,530 --> 00:28:00,643
Will he take a needle and thread
and stitch a heart back?

531
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:05,632
Hello, Nethra. I'm Kishore.

532
00:28:06,383 --> 00:28:07,767
Gautham is in a program now.

533
00:28:07,847 --> 00:28:09,832
Will you come to Yarada
Beach immediately?

534
00:28:09,912 --> 00:28:11,626
Okay, we will come. Bye.

535
00:28:12,123 --> 00:28:13,853
Who was it? Girlfriend?
- Yes.

536
00:28:15,291 --> 00:28:17,074
Does this black face
need a girlfriend?

537
00:28:17,154 --> 00:28:18,871
She is not my girlfriend,
she is Gautham's girlfriend.

538
00:28:18,951 --> 00:28:22,655
This is not fair. You can trip
a girl and make her fall for you.

539
00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:24,655
But he can't do that too.

540
00:28:25,055 --> 00:28:27,898
Stop it. That girl
is interested in Gautham.

541
00:28:29,205 --> 00:28:33,010
Why do girls search for
such defected guys to love?

542
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:36,199
They just use a normal
man like me and discard me.

543
00:28:36,279 --> 00:28:37,551
Disgusting.
- What is it, Sudarshan?

544
00:28:37,631 --> 00:28:39,615
He is here. - Looks like
you are cribbing about something.

545
00:28:39,695 --> 00:28:40,915
He has nothing else to do.

546
00:28:40,995 --> 00:28:42,807
Nethra called up.
- What did she say?

547
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:44,258
She asked us to come to Yarada Beach.

548
00:28:44,338 --> 00:28:45,306
Let's go then.

549
00:28:45,386 --> 00:28:47,404
Wait here. I will go give
this program sheet to Nalini.

550
00:28:47,672 --> 00:28:49,088
Hurry up.
- I'm coming.

551
00:28:49,168 --> 00:28:49,915
Water, sir.

552
00:29:05,927 --> 00:29:07,721
Oh God!

553
00:29:11,148 --> 00:29:13,386
Sorry, buddy. I think you became wet.

554
00:29:13,466 --> 00:29:15,516
Wet? I'm burning here.

555
00:29:15,596 --> 00:29:17,210
It's just water. It will dry off.

556
00:29:18,248 --> 00:29:22,226
Oh God! How did he find
out that it was coffee?

557
00:29:22,561 --> 00:29:23,891
Okay, thank you.

558
00:29:27,539 --> 00:29:28,436
Careful.
- Hi!

559
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:29,323
Hi!
- Hi!

560
00:29:29,403 --> 00:29:30,620
Why did you call
us here all of a sudden?

561
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,663
We would've come prepared
if you had told us earlier.

562
00:29:32,743 --> 00:29:33,691
Prepared?

563
00:29:33,771 --> 00:29:35,961
He meant that we could've
taken leave from work.

564
00:29:36,041 --> 00:29:37,787
Oh, I see.
- So, why did you call us?

565
00:29:38,092 --> 00:29:41,389
Our hospital is conducting an eye
donation camp. - Oh, very nice.

566
00:29:41,469 --> 00:29:44,265
But nobody here is willing
to donate their eyes. - Oh.

567
00:29:44,345 --> 00:29:46,143
If you donate first, you
might inspire them to do the same..

568
00:29:46,223 --> 00:29:47,397
..so I asked you to come.

569
00:29:48,564 --> 00:29:50,229
What? Aren't you interested?

570
00:29:50,445 --> 00:29:51,645
Why not? I can donate them.

571
00:29:51,725 --> 00:29:54,143
They want eyes. Will you donate them?

572
00:29:54,223 --> 00:29:57,311
Yes, eyes.
Our eyes. Let's donate them.

573
00:29:57,391 --> 00:30:00,121
What will you give? You've no eyes.

574
00:30:01,051 --> 00:30:02,392
But I will get new eyes very soon.

575
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:03,905
What will I do with them after I die?

576
00:30:03,985 --> 00:30:05,224
I can help somebody
else if I return them.

577
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:07,372
Come on, you also donate your eyes.
- Thank you. Sign here.

578
00:30:07,858 --> 00:30:09,923
First you, buddy.
- Okay.

579
00:30:15,577 --> 00:30:17,567
Done.
- Thank you so much.

580
00:30:17,804 --> 00:30:20,204
Did you see that?
How simple it is to donate your eyes.

581
00:30:20,464 --> 00:30:22,787
Please come forward and do it.
It won't harm you.

582
00:30:23,014 --> 00:30:24,981
How can we do that?
We will donate some money..

583
00:30:25,061 --> 00:30:26,916
..if you want, but who
would want to donate their eyes?

584
00:30:26,996 --> 00:30:28,159
Who said that?

585
00:30:28,949 --> 00:30:30,484
People without eyes are not blind.

586
00:30:30,808 --> 00:30:32,084
You are blind because
even though you have eyes..

587
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:33,197
..you do not understand
the pain of others.

588
00:30:35,175 --> 00:30:37,077
We still have blind
people amongst us..

589
00:30:37,157 --> 00:30:39,185
..because nobody wants
to donate their eyes.

590
00:30:40,439 --> 00:30:43,229
Otherwise they all would
be seeing the world by now.

591
00:30:43,422 --> 00:30:46,233
Why do you love those eyes
that will turn to dust after you die?

592
00:30:47,314 --> 00:30:49,574
We can't stop someone
from being born as a blind man.

593
00:30:49,654 --> 00:30:52,276
But we can definitely stop
a man from dying a blind man.

594
00:31:01,608 --> 00:31:05,176
Wow! Your speech
about eyes is amazing!

595
00:31:05,256 --> 00:31:06,364
I'm sure that girl fell for you.

596
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:09,078
Actually..
- Sir, shall I send the patients in?

597
00:31:09,699 --> 00:31:13,440
No. Don't send anybody in.
Cancel all my appointments.

598
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,185
Okay, sir.
- Hey, Geetha!

599
00:31:15,265 --> 00:31:17,109
Yes, sir?
- You also don't come in.

600
00:31:17,812 --> 00:31:19,131
Okay, sir.

601
00:31:21,423 --> 00:31:24,266
Interesting. What next?

602
00:31:25,149 --> 00:31:27,614
The location is a coffee shop.

603
00:31:29,257 --> 00:31:30,705
Why did you bring me to a coffee shop?

604
00:31:30,785 --> 00:31:33,841
Surprise.
Sit here. I will be right back. Okay?

605
00:31:33,921 --> 00:31:35,125
I will be back.

606
00:31:35,205 --> 00:31:36,585
Surprise?

607
00:31:39,233 --> 00:31:40,942
Sit on the right side. Right side.

608
00:31:41,022 --> 00:31:42,520
Why can't I sit on the left?

609
00:31:42,747 --> 00:31:44,931
Sure. Sit on the girl's
lap if she agrees.

610
00:31:45,131 --> 00:31:46,482
Oh no! Forget it.

611
00:31:48,731 --> 00:31:49,801
Hi!
- Good morning, madam.

612
00:31:49,881 --> 00:31:51,931
I designed it as you asked.

613
00:31:53,023 --> 00:31:54,104
Wow, superb.

614
00:31:54,184 --> 00:31:55,909
All the best.
- Thank you.

615
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:00,456
This is for you.

616
00:32:02,716 --> 00:32:05,710
We'll have coffee later.
First tell me what the surprise is.

617
00:32:05,977 --> 00:32:07,977
Your coffee will tell you that.

618
00:32:10,431 --> 00:32:11,436
Coffee will tell you?

619
00:32:11,516 --> 00:32:13,177
What will coffee and tea say?

620
00:32:13,257 --> 00:32:15,490
I don't know. How will I know?
I'm sitting in a corner.

621
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:37,399
'Why is he drinking it
like that without any feeling?'

622
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:41,109
Yuck. Waste coffee.
- Waste?

623
00:32:41,189 --> 00:32:42,627
Worst.
- Worst?

624
00:32:42,707 --> 00:32:44,433
It was full of bubbles.
- Bubbles?

625
00:32:44,768 --> 00:32:47,113
So, you didn't like it?
- Not at all.

626
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:50,437
If you don't like my surprise,
I can't journey with you.

627
00:32:50,517 --> 00:32:52,704
Goodbye.
- Goodbye? Where are you going?

628
00:32:52,784 --> 00:32:53,869
Nethra! Nethra!

629
00:32:53,949 --> 00:32:55,545
What did you do?
She left without paying the bill.

630
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,686
What did I do?
I just said the coffee is not nice.

631
00:32:57,766 --> 00:32:59,783
What did you do?
Madam went to great lengths..

632
00:32:59,863 --> 00:33:00,961
..to write 'I love
you' in that coffee.

633
00:33:01,041 --> 00:33:02,788
But you simply mixed
sugar in it and drank it.

634
00:33:02,868 --> 00:33:04,529
She wrote 'I love you' in the coffee?

635
00:33:04,609 --> 00:33:06,183
Why didn't she directly
say it with her mouth?

636
00:33:06,263 --> 00:33:07,318
Why do such creative things?

637
00:33:07,398 --> 00:33:09,899
God gave you such big, big eyes.
Can't you see it?

638
00:33:09,979 --> 00:33:11,575
Hey! Tell him!

639
00:33:11,655 --> 00:33:13,078
He is a dark night.

640
00:33:13,964 --> 00:33:16,083
Nethra! Nethra!

641
00:33:17,013 --> 00:33:18,958
Sorry, Nethra. You said
that I need to love a good girl..

642
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:21,466
..if I want to change.
You are the only good girl I know.

643
00:33:21,546 --> 00:33:23,985
I love you.
- Hey! Who are you? What is this?

644
00:33:24,065 --> 00:33:25,704
Why did you say 'I love you' to me?

645
00:33:25,784 --> 00:33:27,217
Sorry, madam. Sorry, madam.

646
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:30,046
Every woman that wears
the same perfume is not Nethra.

647
00:33:30,295 --> 00:33:32,230
Sorry, madam. My friend is blind.

648
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,678
Oh, it's okay.

649
00:33:36,392 --> 00:33:38,078
'He is blind?'

650
00:33:43,366 --> 00:33:44,890
First remove those specs.

651
00:33:46,425 --> 00:33:47,647
You remove that Bluetooth.

652
00:33:49,341 --> 00:33:51,276
You were with me all this
time and I didn't even realize..

653
00:33:51,514 --> 00:33:53,957
..that you are blind.
I'm such a big fool.

654
00:33:54,141 --> 00:33:55,244
Correct, sister.

655
00:33:55,946 --> 00:33:57,222
And you donated your eyes?

656
00:33:57,302 --> 00:33:59,719
But he inspired so many
to donate their eyes, right?

657
00:33:59,799 --> 00:34:02,099
He cheated me with your help, right?

658
00:34:02,179 --> 00:34:04,523
How did he pretend
to see normally before me?

659
00:34:04,603 --> 00:34:06,165
Practice makes man perfect, sister.

660
00:34:06,368 --> 00:34:08,111
If it was a really big location,
we used to go there..

661
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:09,490
..the previous night and
worked hard to get it right.

662
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:11,963
If it was a small location,
we managed it with Bluetooth.

663
00:34:12,043 --> 00:34:13,098
Yes.
- Yes.

664
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:15,855
I had a really tough
time as his coach, sister.

665
00:34:18,275 --> 00:34:21,491
Why did you hit him?
I did all this for your love.

666
00:34:21,571 --> 00:34:24,052
Oh. Are you trying to cover
it up because you got caught?

667
00:34:24,362 --> 00:34:26,876
I wanted to tell you the truth,
but before I could..

668
00:34:26,956 --> 00:34:29,930
Don't tell me stories.
Don't try to cheat me more.

669
00:34:30,242 --> 00:34:31,728
You believed me every
time I said a lie.

670
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:32,985
Why not believe me
when I'm telling the truth?

671
00:34:33,065 --> 00:34:34,688
Are all girls like this?
Don't they use your brains?

672
00:34:34,949 --> 00:34:37,125
How dare you blame
me for your mistake?

673
00:34:37,205 --> 00:34:39,030
You are blind but still very arrogant.

674
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:40,692
What did you say?

675
00:34:44,463 --> 00:34:47,922
I fell down many times
and got hurt because I'm blind.

676
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:50,256
I didn't feel any pain then.

677
00:34:51,688 --> 00:34:53,499
But I'm feeling the pain now.

678
00:34:54,513 --> 00:34:55,931
Let's go.

679
00:34:56,337 --> 00:34:57,702
Careful.

680
00:35:07,167 --> 00:35:09,437
I'm a very unlucky man.

681
00:35:10,423 --> 00:35:12,982
My parents left me
because I was born blind.

682
00:35:14,468 --> 00:35:17,272
My friends left me after
they got their eyesight.

683
00:35:19,671 --> 00:35:21,259
Now she left me too.

684
00:35:21,339 --> 00:35:23,792
Hey, don't be sad.

685
00:35:23,872 --> 00:35:27,038
They should be sad for
losing a person like you.

686
00:35:29,638 --> 00:35:32,004
Do you think I will
ever get my eyesight?

687
00:35:32,629 --> 00:35:34,825
Or will I remain blind all my life?

688
00:35:45,384 --> 00:35:48,171
He called me, you know.

689
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:53,357
Hi, Nethra. - Kishore, can you
come to my hospital right now?

690
00:35:53,797 --> 00:35:55,095
May I come in, sir?
- Come in.

691
00:35:56,078 --> 00:35:57,430
Sir, look at this file.

692
00:35:58,924 --> 00:36:01,173
It will be good if we
donate these eyes to my friend.

693
00:36:02,027 --> 00:36:05,335
Sorry, Nethra.
We have so many applications for eyes.

694
00:36:05,529 --> 00:36:08,915
You know that too.
- I know, sir. But please help him.

695
00:36:09,232 --> 00:36:10,897
I need to answer so many people.

696
00:36:17,517 --> 00:36:20,306
Okay.
- Thank you, sir. Thank you so much.

697
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:25,388
Okay?
- Done.

698
00:36:25,594 --> 00:36:26,891
Thank you, sister. Thank you.

699
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:29,215
But don't tell Gautham
that I helped him.

700
00:36:29,399 --> 00:36:31,399
Why?
- Just don't tell him.

701
00:36:34,475 --> 00:36:36,399
Yes! Yes! He will be able to see!

702
00:36:39,517 --> 00:36:40,911
Wait, wait, wait.

703
00:36:40,991 --> 00:36:43,203
I can't believe that
I will be able to see.

704
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:46,057
I'm nervous. Are the doctors perfect?

705
00:36:47,585 --> 00:36:49,639
Perfect.
- Are there any cases on this hospital?

706
00:36:49,719 --> 00:36:51,823
No, buddy. Let's go.

707
00:36:52,382 --> 00:36:53,603
Do they have a generator
to use if there is a power-cut?

708
00:36:53,683 --> 00:36:55,182
Yes.
- Wait a minute.

709
00:36:55,809 --> 00:36:58,582
Tell them to see if their
eye drops have bacteria in it.

710
00:37:00,398 --> 00:37:01,998
Tell them that we
know the MLA of Tenali.

711
00:37:02,078 --> 00:37:03,338
Then they will take
their job seriously.

712
00:37:03,511 --> 00:37:06,203
They called you here
to give you eyesight.

713
00:37:06,283 --> 00:37:08,753
Don't ruin it. Just shut up.
Sorry. Please don't mind.

714
00:37:10,224 --> 00:37:11,380
Doctor!
- Yes?

715
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:13,034
Do you guarantee that
I will get my eyesight?

716
00:37:13,114 --> 00:37:14,083
What will you do if
you get your eyesight?

717
00:37:14,163 --> 00:37:16,688
One girl ditched me because
I don't have eyesight, doctor.

718
00:37:16,915 --> 00:37:17,748
I see.

719
00:37:17,828 --> 00:37:19,879
As soon as I get my eyesight,
I will find a girl..

720
00:37:19,959 --> 00:37:21,868
..who is more beautiful than
her and fall in love with her.

721
00:37:52,156 --> 00:37:53,237
Doctor!
- Hmm?

722
00:37:53,317 --> 00:37:54,967
What if I can't see anything?

723
00:37:55,183 --> 00:37:56,740
Then you will never see in your life.

724
00:37:58,945 --> 00:38:00,005
One minute.

725
00:38:05,327 --> 00:38:09,272
That's good.
Now open your eyes slowly. Slowly.

726
00:38:12,529 --> 00:38:14,734
Oh God! I can't see anything!

727
00:38:14,972 --> 00:38:16,356
Buddy! Buddy!

728
00:38:16,436 --> 00:38:18,486
Now I'll never be able to see,
Kishore.

729
00:38:18,566 --> 00:38:20,313
Sue everyone in this hospital.
- Hello!

730
00:38:20,393 --> 00:38:21,482
Don't leave anyone out.

731
00:38:21,655 --> 00:38:22,877
Hello, listen! Relax!
- Don't leave anyone out.

732
00:38:23,104 --> 00:38:24,844
Even we can't see
clearly in this room.

733
00:38:24,924 --> 00:38:27,984
This is the dark room.
Since heavy rays can damage..

734
00:38:28,064 --> 00:38:29,551
..your eyes, we brought you here.

735
00:38:29,631 --> 00:38:31,043
Mr. Rao! Put on the light.

736
00:38:31,123 --> 00:38:32,048
Okay, doctor.

737
00:38:34,362 --> 00:38:35,930
Open your eyes slowly.

738
00:38:36,988 --> 00:38:38,242
Slowly.

739
00:38:39,604 --> 00:38:40,891
Good.

740
00:38:44,328 --> 00:38:45,431
Can you see now?

741
00:38:46,166 --> 00:38:48,231
I can see, doctor. I can see.

742
00:38:50,295 --> 00:38:52,090
Very good.
- I can see, doctor.

743
00:38:52,339 --> 00:38:55,431
Buddy! It is me. Your friend Kishore.

744
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:57,440
Kishore!
- Yes?

745
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,932
Why are you so ugly?

746
00:39:00,218 --> 00:39:03,342
I was just kidding.
I got my eyesight. I can see.

747
00:39:03,515 --> 00:39:04,899
I can see. I got my eyesight.
- Yes, buddy.

748
00:39:04,979 --> 00:39:06,099
I got my eyesight.
- You got your eyesight.

749
00:39:06,179 --> 00:39:07,266
I can see.

750
00:39:07,346 --> 00:39:09,613
You can see. Don't jump too much.

751
00:39:09,693 --> 00:39:11,451
Your eyes are still fresh,
they will fall down.

752
00:39:11,531 --> 00:39:13,343
Shut up.
- You can see the world now.

753
00:39:13,423 --> 00:39:14,813
I can see.

754
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:35,749
'Whose vehicle is that?
How is it connected to me?'

755
00:39:39,985 --> 00:39:41,390
Don't assume that it is true.

756
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:44,223
I wonder if that 9999
number plate really exists.

757
00:39:44,303 --> 00:39:46,288
Don't think too much. Forget it.

758
00:39:46,741 --> 00:39:48,204
Really?
- Yes.

759
00:39:49,404 --> 00:39:50,571
Okay.

760
00:40:21,888 --> 00:40:24,277
Priest! Offer special
prayers on my son's name.

761
00:40:32,021 --> 00:40:33,351
Why did you come here?

762
00:40:33,524 --> 00:40:35,200
Why do people come to the temple, sir?

763
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,275
I came to join my hands
and pray before God.

764
00:40:37,355 --> 00:40:41,065
Maybe you don't know,
but this God is very powerful.

765
00:40:48,568 --> 00:40:51,262
One year back, one customs
officer cancelled my contract..

766
00:40:51,435 --> 00:40:54,116
..stating that I'm smuggling goods.

767
00:40:54,603 --> 00:40:57,262
I came and prayed here that day.

768
00:40:57,467 --> 00:41:00,440
Within a week he died in an accident.

769
00:41:00,985 --> 00:41:03,818
When I heard that
you seized my goods..

770
00:41:03,991 --> 00:41:06,834
..I came here to pray about it.

771
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:11,597
If my work is done I
will offer a goat, otherwise..

772
00:41:15,835 --> 00:41:18,213
What? Are you threatening me?

773
00:41:18,293 --> 00:41:22,035
Forget me, you can't scare
even my four year old son.

774
00:41:23,527 --> 00:41:26,511
He is just four years old, sir.
He doesn't know about me.

775
00:41:26,591 --> 00:41:28,641
I can understand if
he is not scared of me.

776
00:41:28,825 --> 00:41:33,071
But you are 40 years old, sir.
You know me very well.

777
00:41:33,151 --> 00:41:34,963
You have to be afraid of me.

778
00:41:35,043 --> 00:41:36,877
Hey, get out!

779
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:51,405
Husband!

780
00:41:58,237 --> 00:42:03,470
Husband! Husband!

781
00:42:10,944 --> 00:42:12,923
You are troubling God
for giving you eyesight..

782
00:42:13,003 --> 00:42:14,408
..and me for giving you a bike.

783
00:42:14,488 --> 00:42:16,019
I'm catching up on
what I missed till now.

784
00:42:16,099 --> 00:42:17,381
Hey, be careful.

785
00:42:19,684 --> 00:42:21,221
Oh God!

786
00:42:21,716 --> 00:42:23,219
I'm sorry.

787
00:42:30,702 --> 00:42:32,475
Buddy, help me.

788
00:42:35,314 --> 00:42:36,482
Get up. Get up.

789
00:42:37,174 --> 00:42:39,195
God gave me eyesight
and sent me an angel too.

790
00:42:39,379 --> 00:42:40,671
Where?
- There.

791
00:42:40,751 --> 00:42:42,087
After getting his eyesight,
he is flirting with me..

792
00:42:42,167 --> 00:42:43,135
..without realizing who I am.

793
00:42:43,215 --> 00:42:45,254
She is..
- I will kill you if you tell him.

794
00:42:47,034 --> 00:42:48,277
Any trouble?

795
00:42:49,253 --> 00:42:50,679
Gastric trouble. Get lost.

796
00:42:51,209 --> 00:42:53,014
Go away. Do your work.

797
00:42:53,436 --> 00:42:55,133
I'm really sorry.
My driving is perfect.

798
00:42:55,328 --> 00:42:57,360
But my buddy doesn't
know how to sit properly.

799
00:42:57,912 --> 00:42:59,879
I hope you didn't get hurt.

800
00:43:00,333 --> 00:43:01,971
'He might recognize me if I talk.'

801
00:43:07,528 --> 00:43:08,414
Mute?

802
00:43:09,668 --> 00:43:10,436
Yes, she is mute.

803
00:43:10,516 --> 00:43:12,130
Why do you want to talk
to a mute girl? Let's go.

804
00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:14,217
Shut up! If I run away
from her because she is mute..

805
00:43:14,297 --> 00:43:15,709
..like Nethra ran away
from me because I'm blind..

806
00:43:16,941 --> 00:43:18,433
..what will be the difference
between me and her?

807
00:43:18,725 --> 00:43:20,682
Do you know how Nethra looks like?

808
00:43:21,563 --> 00:43:24,082
Even if she is more beautiful
than her, I will love this girl.

809
00:43:29,076 --> 00:43:30,341
Please come.

810
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:44,412
Listen! I love you!

811
00:43:52,704 --> 00:43:57,709
"This world is full of mystery.
Life is full of mystery."

812
00:43:57,789 --> 00:44:02,434
"I became a rocket
launched from Sriharikota."

813
00:44:02,514 --> 00:44:06,975
"Is this a dream or reality?
I fell in love."

814
00:44:07,233 --> 00:44:12,228
"I became excited just
like a kid in a candy store."

815
00:44:12,308 --> 00:44:14,606
"With just one look of yours.."

816
00:44:14,686 --> 00:44:17,200
"..you imprinted a permanent
love symbol in my heart."

817
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:21,298
"You gave my life 100
marks with a permanent marker."

818
00:44:21,504 --> 00:44:26,120
"My heart is dancing
at a record speed."

819
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:31,028
"I hit the love jackpot
by a lucky chance."

820
00:44:31,108 --> 00:44:35,698
"My heart is dancing
at a record speed."

821
00:44:35,778 --> 00:44:40,942
"My pulse rate is jumping
like Rehman's music beats."

822
00:44:42,538 --> 00:44:43,392
Aarthi.

823
00:44:45,327 --> 00:44:46,127
Archana.

824
00:44:48,161 --> 00:44:49,275
Pooja.

825
00:44:59,395 --> 00:45:03,817
"How can a single look
from you give me such a high?"

826
00:45:04,218 --> 00:45:08,964
"My heart is rotating
around itself like the earth."

827
00:45:09,364 --> 00:45:13,915
"I understood what true
love is after I saw you."

828
00:45:14,132 --> 00:45:18,207
"Shall I forget my flashback
and start a new story?"

829
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:23,687
"My heart is filled
with mute love for you."

830
00:45:23,767 --> 00:45:27,817
"How can I ever express
my happiness in words?"

831
00:45:27,897 --> 00:45:32,574
"My heart is dancing
at a record speed."

832
00:45:32,654 --> 00:45:37,525
"I hit the love jackpot
by a lucky chance."

833
00:45:37,605 --> 00:45:42,260
"My heart is dancing
at a record speed."

834
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:47,254
"My pulse rate is jumping
like Rehman's music beats."

835
00:45:47,334 --> 00:45:51,546
"This world is full of mystery.
Life is full of mystery."

836
00:45:52,216 --> 00:45:56,638
"I became a rocket
launched from Sriharikota."

837
00:46:02,806 --> 00:46:04,341
'That's the gift I gave him.'

838
00:46:04,698 --> 00:46:06,828
I brought it as a
special gift for you.

839
00:46:06,908 --> 00:46:09,050
'You are giving me
the gift I gave you?'

840
00:46:11,503 --> 00:46:15,957
"You came down on me
like a monsoon of jasmines."

841
00:46:16,151 --> 00:46:21,254
"You completely changed my
dull life and made it thrilling."

842
00:46:21,334 --> 00:46:26,054
"I feel like I'm surrounded
by colorful festivals."

843
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:30,292
"All the clouds in the
sky are under my feet now."

844
00:46:31,082 --> 00:46:35,881
"I feel like I got
a lifetime free Jio sim."

845
00:46:35,961 --> 00:46:39,817
"My body is rushing forward
like a vehicle with no brakes."

846
00:46:40,152 --> 00:46:44,897
"My heart is dancing
at a record speed."

847
00:46:44,977 --> 00:46:49,676
"I hit the love jackpot
by a lucky chance."

848
00:46:49,756 --> 00:46:54,465
"My heart is dancing
at a record speed."

849
00:46:54,545 --> 00:46:59,481
"My pulse rate is jumping
like Rehman's music beats."

850
00:46:59,561 --> 00:47:01,740
"This world is full of mystery."

851
00:47:03,075 --> 00:47:05,010
What is this? What is going on?

852
00:47:05,090 --> 00:47:07,443
You committed a murder
and now you are coolly joking.

853
00:47:07,523 --> 00:47:09,778
If you get caught, you will
get 14 years of imprisonment..

854
00:47:09,858 --> 00:47:12,578
..under IPC Section 497, you know?

855
00:47:12,658 --> 00:47:15,745
Lawyer sir, Section 497
is for illegitimate affairs.

856
00:47:16,263 --> 00:47:18,945
Oh. Then they will punish
you under Section 376.

857
00:47:19,025 --> 00:47:20,026
That will be for a rape case.

858
00:47:21,896 --> 00:47:23,647
You tell me which section it is.

859
00:47:23,882 --> 00:47:25,807
According to the India Penal Code..

860
00:47:26,315 --> 00:47:30,272
..Section 302 for murder
and 307 for attempted murder.

861
00:47:30,693 --> 00:47:33,482
Oh God! Everyone commits crimes,
researches the law..

862
00:47:33,562 --> 00:47:36,911
..and think they
are Kamna Bhattmalani.

863
00:47:37,268 --> 00:47:40,554
Not Kamna Bhattmalani, sir.
Ram Jethmalani.

864
00:47:40,976 --> 00:47:44,057
And it takes great
courage to arrest boss.

865
00:47:49,170 --> 00:47:51,872
Stop. You need
permission to meet boss.

866
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:54,327
Move aside!

867
00:47:59,481 --> 00:48:01,676
Babji! You are happily
eating 'Biryani' here..

868
00:48:01,756 --> 00:48:03,524
..after committing a murder?

869
00:48:03,697 --> 00:48:06,638
Sir! One says,
'Star hero is my father.'

870
00:48:07,275 --> 00:48:09,059
Another says, 'Sridevi is my wife.'

871
00:48:09,139 --> 00:48:11,707
Every idiot has the
right to say something.

872
00:48:12,086 --> 00:48:14,097
But there should be some evidence.

873
00:48:16,486 --> 00:48:17,556
Read it.

874
00:48:18,361 --> 00:48:19,572
See what it is, Lawyer.

875
00:48:22,847 --> 00:48:26,123
Oh God! What you are eating
is not Chicken 'Biryani'..

876
00:48:26,318 --> 00:48:27,416
..it is 'Peacock Biryani.'
Put it away.

877
00:48:27,496 --> 00:48:28,248
Peacock meat?

878
00:48:28,328 --> 00:48:31,319
I'll arrest you with a
6 month non-bailable warrant..

879
00:48:31,399 --> 00:48:33,286
..for eating peacock meat.

880
00:48:33,366 --> 00:48:37,189
In these 6 months I'll gather
evidences for your crimes..

881
00:48:37,269 --> 00:48:39,211
..and make sure that you
remain in jail permanently.

882
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:40,768
Who served me Peacock 'Biryani'?

883
00:48:40,995 --> 00:48:42,465
DCP!

884
00:48:42,930 --> 00:48:45,495
A criminal thinks
only like a criminal.

885
00:48:45,575 --> 00:48:48,371
But a policeman can choose
to think like a criminal too.

886
00:48:48,451 --> 00:48:49,754
Let's go.
- Hey!

887
00:48:54,576 --> 00:48:57,654
Oh God! Alexander the Great
conquered the whole world..

888
00:48:57,734 --> 00:49:00,390
..but died with a fever.
In the same way, he killed..

889
00:49:00,573 --> 00:49:03,222
..so many people but went
to jail for killing a peacock.

890
00:49:03,302 --> 00:49:04,271
Do something, sir.

891
00:49:04,351 --> 00:49:07,480
I will. According to Section 490..

892
00:49:08,756 --> 00:49:10,593
Forget it.
I will read the book tonight and..

893
00:49:10,673 --> 00:49:11,956
..say it correctly tomorrow.

894
00:49:19,448 --> 00:49:22,140
Idiot! Can't you see?
- Sorry.

895
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:23,875
Sorry? Is it enough to say sorry?

896
00:49:23,955 --> 00:49:25,540
It's okay. He said sorry.

897
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:27,051
We don't want any trouble with goons.
Let it go.

898
00:49:27,131 --> 00:49:28,910
Why should I let it go?
Did God give me a mouth..

899
00:49:28,990 --> 00:49:30,500
..to keep quiet when I face injustice?

900
00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:31,645
You are right.

901
00:49:31,725 --> 00:49:34,208
You! Have you gone blind? Idiot!

902
00:49:43,475 --> 00:49:44,588
Oh God!

903
00:49:49,135 --> 00:49:50,778
Why did you call me here?

904
00:49:50,994 --> 00:49:52,464
She pretended to be mute.

905
00:49:52,544 --> 00:49:54,572
We also pretended in the past.

906
00:49:56,616 --> 00:49:57,902
How can you cheat me like this?

907
00:49:57,982 --> 00:49:59,624
We cheated her in the past.

908
00:50:01,538 --> 00:50:03,268
Hello! You can discuss
your grievances with me.

909
00:50:03,348 --> 00:50:05,192
I don't discuss anything
with cheaters like you.

910
00:50:05,462 --> 00:50:06,511
What do you call what you did?

911
00:50:06,591 --> 00:50:08,403
You gave me the same
gift that I gave you.

912
00:50:09,057 --> 00:50:10,906
I had to do that because
I didn't have money.

913
00:50:11,306 --> 00:50:12,247
What should I do?
- Yes.

914
00:50:12,327 --> 00:50:14,441
Modi sir banned all
old notes during that time.

915
00:50:15,338 --> 00:50:18,474
Look! You did a mistake
and I did a mistake. Tit for tat.

916
00:50:18,554 --> 00:50:20,169
What is tit for tat?

917
00:50:22,288 --> 00:50:23,164
Do you know what that means?

918
00:50:23,244 --> 00:50:25,034
I have nobody else
in this world except you.

919
00:50:26,526 --> 00:50:27,629
Do you know what that means?

920
00:50:27,709 --> 00:50:29,466
I will die without you.

921
00:50:30,361 --> 00:50:32,847
I learnt mute language
for you in just 30 days.

922
00:50:33,517 --> 00:50:35,561
What did you do? What did you do?

923
00:50:36,361 --> 00:50:39,139
Do you know who gave you those eyes?

924
00:50:39,312 --> 00:50:41,402
Dr. Hidimbi.
- Rubbish.

925
00:50:41,849 --> 00:50:43,200
She did.

926
00:50:46,457 --> 00:50:47,917
She wanted to show you the world..

927
00:50:47,997 --> 00:50:49,668
..even if you don't want to see her.

928
00:50:51,052 --> 00:50:52,652
She requested the Dean
to give you those eyes..

929
00:50:52,732 --> 00:50:54,911
..and she herself made
the arrangements for surgery.

930
00:50:57,053 --> 00:50:58,740
Then why didn't you tell me?

931
00:50:58,820 --> 00:51:01,378
I didn't want you to
love me because I helped you..

932
00:51:01,802 --> 00:51:03,648
..or did a favor to you.

933
00:51:04,015 --> 00:51:06,599
I wanted you to love me for who I am.

934
00:51:14,053 --> 00:51:16,962
Superb. Superb.

935
00:51:19,048 --> 00:51:21,556
Your love is a success too.

936
00:51:22,032 --> 00:51:24,407
So, why do you want
me to remove your eyes?

937
00:51:28,472 --> 00:51:33,088
Exactly at that moment,
one villain entered my life, sir.

938
00:51:39,090 --> 00:51:40,258
Shall I go?

939
00:51:40,593 --> 00:51:42,653
You can go after you give
me the four things I want.

940
00:51:42,733 --> 00:51:44,101
No way.
- At least three?

941
00:51:44,413 --> 00:51:46,142
If you talk too much,
I'll give you one punch.

942
00:51:47,371 --> 00:51:48,530
Bye.

943
00:51:54,051 --> 00:51:54,984
Is she beautiful?

944
00:51:55,064 --> 00:51:58,738
Beautiful?
Whoever is my darling's father..

945
00:51:59,136 --> 00:52:00,839
..I will put a garland around
his neck and touch his feet.

946
00:52:00,919 --> 00:52:03,366
What are you waiting for?
Go ahead and do that.

947
00:52:03,936 --> 00:52:05,009
Sir, you are..

948
00:52:05,089 --> 00:52:06,695
Her father.
- Father in law!

949
00:52:06,775 --> 00:52:10,076
I'll hit you with my shoe.
I'm not your father in law.

950
00:52:10,292 --> 00:52:14,631
You borrow 3,000 or
4,000 rupees from a girl.

951
00:52:14,826 --> 00:52:16,567
How dare you call me father in law?

952
00:52:16,761 --> 00:52:19,356
I wasn't talking about money, sir.
- Then? You said 3.

953
00:52:19,550 --> 00:52:20,944
I meant H-U-G.

954
00:52:21,024 --> 00:52:22,544
A hug?
- Yes.

955
00:52:22,739 --> 00:52:23,874
What is four?

956
00:52:23,954 --> 00:52:25,104
K-I-S-S.

957
00:52:25,184 --> 00:52:27,233
K-I-S-S, a kiss. This is very wrong.

958
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:28,624
No, sir. I said 'Kismis'
which means raisins.

959
00:52:28,704 --> 00:52:31,860
Don't act innocent now.
You asked for a kiss.

960
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:35,081
How can you ask a girl
to kiss you in a public place?

961
00:52:35,161 --> 00:52:37,406
Sir, as a father you
may feel this is wrong.

962
00:52:37,486 --> 00:52:40,411
But these things are common
in love affairs these days.

963
00:52:40,491 --> 00:52:41,676
What do you do for a living?

964
00:52:41,756 --> 00:52:42,832
I'm a jockey, sir.

965
00:52:42,912 --> 00:52:45,967
Jockey? Do you sell
underwear on the streets?

966
00:52:46,047 --> 00:52:48,497
No. I'm a radio jockey, sir.
- How much do you earn?

967
00:52:48,577 --> 00:52:50,191
I get 15,000 rupees in
hand after all the deductions.

968
00:52:50,375 --> 00:52:52,295
Do you have any savings?
- No.

969
00:52:52,375 --> 00:52:53,996
So you don't have foresight.

970
00:52:54,076 --> 00:52:55,618
I got my eyesight
just one month back, sir.

971
00:52:55,698 --> 00:52:56,903
How will I have foresight?

972
00:52:56,983 --> 00:52:58,222
Disgusting.

973
00:52:58,302 --> 00:53:02,114
Why should I give you my daughter?

974
00:53:02,194 --> 00:53:04,308
I love her, sir.
What other qualification do you need?

975
00:53:04,388 --> 00:53:05,573
Really?

976
00:53:05,653 --> 00:53:07,913
Are you such a great lover?
- Yes.

977
00:53:08,156 --> 00:53:10,134
Come with me.
I will settle this right now.

978
00:53:12,276 --> 00:53:14,006
Get a blood test done.
- A blood test? Why?

979
00:53:14,254 --> 00:53:17,897
BP, diabetes,
ulcers, cancer, HIV, bolli..

980
00:53:18,081 --> 00:53:20,341
..I have to make sure that
you have none of these diseases.

981
00:53:20,421 --> 00:53:22,200
Why will I have HIV or bolli?

982
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:23,839
I'm a gentleman.
I have no such diseases.

983
00:53:23,919 --> 00:53:25,245
I have.
- What?

984
00:53:25,325 --> 00:53:26,628
Doubts.

985
00:53:26,874 --> 00:53:29,353
I'm the girl's father.
You have no money.

986
00:53:29,433 --> 00:53:32,034
So I have to make sure
that you are at least healthy.

987
00:53:32,114 --> 00:53:33,569
Is that what you want?
- Yes.

988
00:53:33,649 --> 00:53:36,102
I will get a clean certificate.
Wait and watch.

989
00:53:36,182 --> 00:53:37,119
Go ahead.
- Sister!

990
00:53:37,199 --> 00:53:39,973
Yes, sir? - Do all the tests
available in this hospital.

991
00:53:40,053 --> 00:53:41,551
Okay, sir.

992
00:53:46,906 --> 00:53:49,760
A clean certificate.
Perfect. See for yourself.

993
00:53:50,690 --> 00:53:52,355
Okay. Next test.

994
00:53:54,459 --> 00:53:56,145
Do you know this place?

995
00:53:56,535 --> 00:53:57,886
Yes, I know.

996
00:53:57,966 --> 00:53:59,562
24,000 rupees per square yard.

997
00:53:59,642 --> 00:54:00,783
How much land do you own?

998
00:54:00,863 --> 00:54:02,340
And how much will
you give me as dowry?

999
00:54:02,535 --> 00:54:03,897
So that you can sit and eat.

1000
00:54:04,081 --> 00:54:05,638
I didn't bring you
here to give you any land.

1001
00:54:05,718 --> 00:54:07,281
Then?
- I brought you here to make you run.

1002
00:54:07,962 --> 00:54:09,324
Forget it.

1003
00:54:15,726 --> 00:54:17,586
Fitness test is done.

1004
00:54:17,780 --> 00:54:19,542
If you do another 19 rounds.

1005
00:54:19,622 --> 00:54:20,937
19 rounds?
- Yes.

1006
00:54:21,142 --> 00:54:22,926
Do you think these are
like your walks after dinner?

1007
00:54:23,006 --> 00:54:24,526
No.
- Wait a minute.

1008
00:54:26,461 --> 00:54:30,224
Hello! - If your father doesn't
approve of us, will you elope with me?

1009
00:54:30,304 --> 00:54:32,656
I will marry you only if my dad agrees.
- Otherwise?

1010
00:54:32,736 --> 00:54:35,034
You can marry another girl
and I will marry another boy.

1011
00:54:37,389 --> 00:54:38,751
Did she give her answer?

1012
00:54:46,459 --> 00:54:47,949
Can I get a drinks break?

1013
00:54:48,241 --> 00:54:49,441
You can take a break if you want.

1014
00:54:49,521 --> 00:54:51,895
But then you'll have
to start from scratch again.

1015
00:54:53,474 --> 00:54:55,841
Hit me with your
shoe if I ask for water.

1016
00:54:56,717 --> 00:54:58,079
Good boy.

1017
00:55:07,782 --> 00:55:09,404
You finished 20 rounds.

1018
00:55:09,577 --> 00:55:10,572
I'm finished.

1019
00:55:10,652 --> 00:55:13,426
Good. You have average fitness.

1020
00:55:14,377 --> 00:55:16,302
Next.
- Next?

1021
00:55:19,183 --> 00:55:22,594
If you ride so fast, you will
meet with an accident. Be careful.

1022
00:55:22,674 --> 00:55:25,459
I'm feeling tired, sir.
- You are riding a bike, not a bicycle.

1023
00:55:25,963 --> 00:55:28,082
How should my son in law drive?

1024
00:55:28,309 --> 00:55:32,244
If he twists the accelerator,
the silencer should scream.

1025
00:55:32,324 --> 00:55:34,071
Then watch me.

1026
00:55:43,416 --> 00:55:45,081
Actually, it is..

1027
00:55:46,132 --> 00:55:48,571
You got drunk and rammed
into a police vehicle?

1028
00:55:48,651 --> 00:55:51,036
Alcohol? I didn't even drink water.

1029
00:55:51,935 --> 00:55:53,293
My brakes failed, sir.

1030
00:55:54,185 --> 00:55:56,260
We rammed into his car on purpose.
What will he do?

1031
00:55:56,340 --> 00:55:57,523
Be quiet. Let me talk. Please.

1032
00:55:57,603 --> 00:55:58,578
Srinivas!
- Yes, sir?

1033
00:55:58,658 --> 00:55:59,945
Take the bike.
- Okay, sir.

1034
00:56:00,025 --> 00:56:01,449
Let him pay a fine in the
court tomorrow to get it back.

1035
00:56:01,529 --> 00:56:03,595
Sir! Sir! Sir!
- Get out!

1036
00:56:03,675 --> 00:56:04,910
Go.

1037
00:56:07,772 --> 00:56:10,972
He made this Kulkarni walk.
I will make him limp.

1038
00:56:11,127 --> 00:56:12,173
What?

1039
00:56:12,253 --> 00:56:14,725
I will make sure that
he limps his way back home.

1040
00:56:14,906 --> 00:56:17,181
Go fail the brakes of his car.

1041
00:56:17,579 --> 00:56:18,867
That is a police vehicle, sir.

1042
00:56:19,624 --> 00:56:22,149
Having physical
strength is not enough.

1043
00:56:22,305 --> 00:56:25,176
Courage is very important.
Prove that you have it.

1044
00:56:25,256 --> 00:56:26,552
This is your final test.

1045
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:28,290
What kind of tests are these?

1046
00:56:28,468 --> 00:56:29,704
You don't want them? Okay.

1047
00:56:29,903 --> 00:56:31,659
Wait, wait, wait.

1048
00:56:32,152 --> 00:56:33,648
Do I have a choice?

1049
00:56:34,548 --> 00:56:35,611
Go then.

1050
00:56:36,964 --> 00:56:38,642
Okay, okay. No problem.

1051
00:56:41,798 --> 00:56:42,784
I'm coming right away.

1052
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:50,266
I did it.
- Good boy. I'm happy now.

1053
00:56:50,703 --> 00:56:53,393
Come to my house tomorrow morning.
We can discuss..

1054
00:56:53,826 --> 00:56:58,294
..the wedding venue,
number of guests and expenses.

1055
00:56:58,374 --> 00:56:59,228
Sir!

1056
00:56:59,308 --> 00:57:02,333
Don't call me sir. Call me father.

1057
00:57:02,413 --> 00:57:03,777
Father!

1058
00:57:19,515 --> 00:57:22,032
Father! Father! Father!

1059
00:57:22,112 --> 00:57:23,087
Why did you directly come home?

1060
00:57:23,167 --> 00:57:24,056
What are these clothes?

1061
00:57:24,136 --> 00:57:25,068
These are traditional clothes.

1062
00:57:25,148 --> 00:57:26,261
I came to discuss about our wedding.

1063
00:57:26,341 --> 00:57:27,256
Wedding?

1064
00:57:27,473 --> 00:57:28,364
Who is he?

1065
00:57:28,684 --> 00:57:29,730
Your grandmother?

1066
00:57:30,050 --> 00:57:32,645
Uncle didn't mention her.
I thought she was dead.

1067
00:57:34,522 --> 00:57:37,158
How much is your BP?
190? Bring it down.

1068
00:57:37,408 --> 00:57:38,671
Bring it down to normal.

1069
00:57:38,965 --> 00:57:41,067
She has to be healthy if
she wants to play with our kids.

1070
00:57:42,226 --> 00:57:44,754
I'm your future son in law.
Bless me, mother.

1071
00:57:45,221 --> 00:57:46,207
She is our maidservant.

1072
00:57:46,287 --> 00:57:47,677
Idiot! You are always in a rush.

1073
00:57:47,757 --> 00:57:48,931
I know. Sometimes a 100 rupees note..

1074
00:57:49,011 --> 00:57:50,375
..is more valuable
than a 1,000 rupee note.

1075
00:57:50,455 --> 00:57:51,301
Who is it?

1076
00:57:52,453 --> 00:57:53,569
Santoor Mom?

1077
00:57:54,451 --> 00:57:55,619
You are...?

1078
00:57:55,699 --> 00:57:56,587
Oh God!

1079
00:57:56,769 --> 00:57:58,092
Bless me, mother.

1080
00:57:59,813 --> 00:58:02,146
A small secret. You are
more beautiful than your daughter.

1081
00:58:02,226 --> 00:58:04,455
Take this as a compliment
and please bring me coffee.

1082
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:05,813
Just a minute.

1083
00:58:05,893 --> 00:58:07,378
Why are you creating a scene here?
My dad is upstairs.

1084
00:58:07,458 --> 00:58:10,170
Don't worry. I passed all the tests.

1085
00:58:10,250 --> 00:58:11,398
So, the only thing
left is our wedding.

1086
00:58:11,571 --> 00:58:13,387
Don't you believe me?
I will ask uncle to say it.

1087
00:58:13,467 --> 00:58:15,039
Uncle!
- He is upstairs.

1088
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:16,812
My little brother in law.

1089
00:58:16,892 --> 00:58:19,774
If he is with me, I'll feel
as if I have an elephant with me.

1090
00:58:20,068 --> 00:58:22,636
Uncle! Uncle! Un..

1091
00:58:25,888 --> 00:58:28,007
What is he doing here?
- What are you doing here?

1092
00:58:28,406 --> 00:58:30,169
I came to meet Nethra's father, sir.

1093
00:58:30,249 --> 00:58:31,293
Tell me.

1094
00:58:31,373 --> 00:58:32,947
No, sir.
I have to say this to her father.

1095
00:58:33,027 --> 00:58:34,810
I'm Nethra's father. Tell me.

1096
00:58:35,004 --> 00:58:37,091
You must be someone else's father,
sir. Try to remember.

1097
00:58:37,383 --> 00:58:39,739
What are you talking about?
- Dad! Dad! He is the one I love.

1098
00:58:39,819 --> 00:58:41,037
How can you love this man?

1099
00:58:41,117 --> 00:58:43,469
Dad? If he is your dad,
who is the man that..

1100
00:58:43,648 --> 00:58:44,924
..made me go through
all the tests and..

1101
00:58:45,004 --> 00:58:47,129
..asked me to come home
to talk about the wedding?

1102
00:58:47,691 --> 00:58:49,594
Do you know what you are talking?

1103
00:58:49,674 --> 00:58:52,137
Yes, Nethra. He asked me
to fail the brakes of his car.

1104
00:58:52,217 --> 00:58:54,537
You failed the brakes of my car?
- Sir! Sir! Sir! - Dad!

1105
00:58:55,572 --> 00:58:58,188
Sir, I didn't do it on purpose.
He asked me to do it.

1106
00:58:58,268 --> 00:58:59,259
Who is he?

1107
00:58:59,339 --> 00:59:01,713
The man that was with me last night.
You saw him.

1108
00:59:01,909 --> 00:59:04,049
Nobody was with you.
- Good morning, sir.

1109
00:59:04,606 --> 00:59:06,486
Come, Srinu! Did you see him?

1110
00:59:06,566 --> 00:59:09,005
Yes, sir.
Last night we took his bike keys.

1111
00:59:09,085 --> 00:59:10,724
Did you see anyone beside him?

1112
00:59:11,664 --> 00:59:12,724
I think so, sir.

1113
00:59:12,804 --> 00:59:14,561
Have you gone blind?
There was nobody beside him.

1114
00:59:14,641 --> 00:59:15,707
Yes, sir.

1115
00:59:15,787 --> 00:59:18,669
No, Nethra. I'm sure
your dad is playing some game.

1116
00:59:18,749 --> 00:59:20,377
He came to the hospital
with me yesterday.

1117
00:59:20,457 --> 00:59:22,885
He made me do a blood test.
I can prove it if you want.

1118
00:59:22,965 --> 00:59:23,923
Is that so?
- Yes.

1119
00:59:24,003 --> 00:59:26,601
Is that so?
Come on, then. I will prove it to you.

1120
00:59:26,861 --> 00:59:29,066
I will prove it to you..
- Dad, please.

1121
00:59:29,146 --> 00:59:31,737
I will finish you if I'm right.
Come on.

1122
00:59:33,423 --> 00:59:34,645
Yes, sir.

1123
00:59:36,443 --> 00:59:37,773
Sister!
- Okay, sir.

1124
00:59:37,853 --> 00:59:39,578
Tell me, sir.
- You gave me my blood test file, right?

1125
00:59:39,658 --> 00:59:40,627
Yes, sir.

1126
00:59:40,707 --> 00:59:42,248
See? See?

1127
00:59:42,573 --> 00:59:43,870
There was a man with
me yesterday, right?

1128
00:59:43,950 --> 00:59:46,411
Nobody was with you, sir.
You came alone.

1129
00:59:47,399 --> 00:59:50,491
When you were talking to yourself
I thought you had some problem.

1130
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:53,161
Yes, sir. I thought the same.

1131
00:59:53,241 --> 00:59:54,729
Why will I have a problem?

1132
00:59:54,809 --> 00:59:56,331
I did all the tests
because he asked me to.

1133
00:59:56,411 --> 00:59:59,499
She said there was nobody with you.
Stop your drama.

1134
01:00:03,769 --> 01:00:04,885
There was nobody with me?

1135
01:00:04,965 --> 01:00:07,642
I will prove it to you.
Get the CCTV camera footage.

1136
01:00:09,674 --> 01:00:11,415
Hello! Show us yesterday's
CCTV camera footage..

1137
01:00:11,495 --> 01:00:12,755
..at the reception area.
- Yes, sir.

1138
01:00:14,750 --> 01:00:16,750
Yes, that's the one. Play it.
- Sir.

1139
01:00:43,316 --> 01:00:44,602
Do you understand it now?

1140
01:00:45,216 --> 01:00:47,097
He is definitely mad.

1141
01:00:47,270 --> 01:00:50,470
He is imagining a non-existent
man and talking to him. Let's go.

1142
01:00:54,956 --> 01:00:57,204
Nethra! Nethra!

1143
01:00:59,539 --> 01:01:00,804
Wait, Nethra.

1144
01:01:00,884 --> 01:01:02,782
Believe me.
A man named Ranjith Kulakarni..

1145
01:01:02,862 --> 01:01:04,372
..was with me the whole day yesterday.

1146
01:01:06,490 --> 01:01:07,582
What was his name?

1147
01:01:07,662 --> 01:01:09,171
Ranjith Kulakarni.

1148
01:01:09,251 --> 01:01:10,922
Ranjith Kulakarni?

1149
01:01:11,106 --> 01:01:12,533
Kulakarni?

1150
01:01:12,955 --> 01:01:14,328
Dad, just a minute.
I will be right back.

1151
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:29,354
Is he the one you are talking about?

1152
01:01:30,597 --> 01:01:31,441
Yes, it is him.

1153
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:33,841
What are you talking?
This man died two months ago.

1154
01:01:35,592 --> 01:01:37,560
We gave you his eyes.

1155
01:01:38,916 --> 01:01:41,413
Why are you still talking
to this crazy man, dear?

1156
01:01:42,376 --> 01:01:45,403
I don't mind if my
daughter loves a poor man..

1157
01:01:45,483 --> 01:01:48,495
..but I won't allow her
to love a crazy man like you.

1158
01:01:50,299 --> 01:01:53,618
I'll shoot you if I see
you with my daughter again.

1159
01:01:55,186 --> 01:01:56,440
Come on.

1160
01:02:02,010 --> 01:02:03,448
Gautham!

1161
01:02:14,764 --> 01:02:17,788
'If he is dead,
who was with me all day yesterday?'

1162
01:02:21,096 --> 01:02:22,675
I'm the girl's father.

1163
01:02:24,869 --> 01:02:27,280
How should my son in law drive?

1164
01:02:27,453 --> 01:02:29,853
Call me father!

1165
01:02:49,702 --> 01:02:52,524
I'm a spirit, son in law.

1166
01:03:05,790 --> 01:03:09,455
What? The man that traveled
with you is a spirit?

1167
01:03:09,535 --> 01:03:10,666
I can't believe it.

1168
01:03:10,746 --> 01:03:13,389
It is true, sir.
Here, this is the man.

1169
01:03:16,092 --> 01:03:18,968
Why did he approach
you as your father in law?

1170
01:03:19,649 --> 01:03:22,243
Why did he do those physical
tests and medical tests?

1171
01:03:22,323 --> 01:03:24,854
You have a couple of doubts, sir.
I had a thousand doubts.

1172
01:03:25,070 --> 01:03:26,021
Who will clear them?

1173
01:03:26,101 --> 01:03:28,140
I can't ask him because
he is a spirit. I'm doomed.

1174
01:03:28,220 --> 01:03:30,810
Understood.
Do you want to remove your eyes..

1175
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:32,129
..because you are
scared of this spirit?

1176
01:03:32,209 --> 01:03:35,030
No, sir. I got my eyesight
after so many years..

1177
01:03:35,484 --> 01:03:37,808
..I'm not a fool to lose
them for such a small reason.

1178
01:03:37,888 --> 01:03:40,522
Then, what is the reason?

1179
01:03:42,176 --> 01:03:45,276
Ever since that day, I started
getting scared for everything.

1180
01:04:30,442 --> 01:04:34,330
Come out. Why are you so scared of me?

1181
01:04:34,517 --> 01:04:35,955
I'm a human being like you.

1182
01:04:36,035 --> 01:04:39,769
But you are still alive and I'm dead.
That's all.

1183
01:04:39,849 --> 01:04:41,413
Why don't you say you are a ghost?

1184
01:04:41,493 --> 01:04:42,645
Why are you following me?

1185
01:04:42,725 --> 01:04:45,802
Because you have my eyes.

1186
01:04:47,294 --> 01:04:49,910
Nobody can see me except you.

1187
01:04:50,223 --> 01:04:53,564
Ours is an eye-relationship.

1188
01:04:53,780 --> 01:04:55,780
Will you torture me all my life?

1189
01:04:55,860 --> 01:04:59,597
No. I have two wishes.
If you fulfill them..

1190
01:04:59,677 --> 01:05:01,889
..my soul will go to heaven.

1191
01:05:01,969 --> 01:05:03,359
You won't have to
bear my torture anymore.

1192
01:05:03,439 --> 01:05:05,716
Thank God! I understood everything.

1193
01:05:05,911 --> 01:05:07,554
So you want me to donate
food on your name..

1194
01:05:07,634 --> 01:05:09,254
..or offer prayers to pacify
your soul. Is that right?

1195
01:05:09,334 --> 01:05:10,995
Almost.

1196
01:05:11,075 --> 01:05:13,276
That's very easy. I know a priest.

1197
01:05:13,356 --> 01:05:15,092
He'll recite mantras as long
as you want if I pay him 100 rupees.

1198
01:05:15,172 --> 01:05:16,564
And there are lots
of beggars in Vizag..

1199
01:05:16,644 --> 01:05:18,628
..that I can donate food to.
- Shut up.

1200
01:05:19,483 --> 01:05:21,807
I will tell you what to do.

1201
01:05:24,456 --> 01:05:25,904
5,000 rupees are enough
to donate food to the poor.

1202
01:05:25,984 --> 01:05:27,299
Why did you ask me
to bring 100,000 rupees?

1203
01:05:27,379 --> 01:05:31,710
I will tell you. I will tell you.
Right here. Stop the bike.

1204
01:05:33,725 --> 01:05:35,963
You get delicious snacks here.
- Snacks?

1205
01:05:36,493 --> 01:05:38,212
Why did we come so far to buy snacks?

1206
01:05:38,292 --> 01:05:39,952
And why only these snacks?

1207
01:05:40,032 --> 01:05:43,016
One of my friends likes these snacks.

1208
01:05:43,466 --> 01:05:46,856
He asked me for them before my death.
But I died without taking them to him.

1209
01:05:46,936 --> 01:05:49,113
Now I have to give them to him.

1210
01:05:49,193 --> 01:05:51,527
I got it. Sentiment, right?
- Yes.

1211
01:05:51,607 --> 01:05:52,764
I will bring them.

1212
01:05:53,508 --> 01:05:56,016
He is a soft soul.
He wants snacks and sweets.

1213
01:05:56,457 --> 01:05:58,165
Stop. Whom do you want?

1214
01:05:58,347 --> 01:06:00,284
I want snacks.
- Snacks?

1215
01:06:03,519 --> 01:06:06,741
Father, someone is here.
He wants snacks.

1216
01:06:08,946 --> 01:06:09,958
He is coming.

1217
01:06:12,345 --> 01:06:13,591
Who sent you?

1218
01:06:14,442 --> 01:06:16,509
Rahim Bhai.
- Rahim Bhai.

1219
01:06:16,589 --> 01:06:18,290
100,000 rupees.
- 100,000 rupees for snacks?

1220
01:06:18,370 --> 01:06:20,747
Yes. That's why I asked
you to bring 100,000 rupees.

1221
01:06:20,827 --> 01:06:21,966
But sir..

1222
01:06:22,046 --> 01:06:26,138
If you do this for me,
one of my wishes will be fulfilled.

1223
01:06:27,521 --> 01:06:29,165
'Who is he talking to?'

1224
01:06:29,398 --> 01:06:31,759
Give me the money.
- Bring the snacks.

1225
01:06:35,409 --> 01:06:37,346
Here you go. Take them safely.

1226
01:06:39,212 --> 01:06:41,599
When will the lawyer
bring our boss out?

1227
01:06:41,679 --> 01:06:43,017
Didn't he arrange for the bail yet?

1228
01:06:43,097 --> 01:06:47,246
That lawyer is a useless man.

1229
01:06:48,368 --> 01:06:50,150
Yes, here. Stop.

1230
01:06:52,433 --> 01:06:54,197
Why does this place look so shady?

1231
01:06:54,457 --> 01:06:57,257
Why do you care?
Give him the snacks on my name.

1232
01:06:57,337 --> 01:06:58,606
Will you go away if
I give this parcel to him?

1233
01:06:58,686 --> 01:07:00,344
I have to give some
sweets to another friend.

1234
01:07:00,424 --> 01:07:01,477
Once you do that,
I will surely go away.

1235
01:07:01,557 --> 01:07:02,541
I wonder how many thousands
that will cost me.

1236
01:07:02,621 --> 01:07:04,452
You'll understand my pain
if you stand in the ATM queue.

1237
01:07:05,843 --> 01:07:06,898
Stop.

1238
01:07:06,978 --> 01:07:08,074
Is sir inside?

1239
01:07:08,154 --> 01:07:09,406
Yes.
- Take this.

1240
01:07:09,744 --> 01:07:12,407
What is this?
- Snacks. I brought them for sir.

1241
01:07:12,487 --> 01:07:13,654
I will give it to him. Now go.

1242
01:07:13,734 --> 01:07:16,465
Tell him that Kulakarni sent them.
Don't forget.

1243
01:07:16,545 --> 01:07:17,995
Okay.
- Thanks.

1244
01:07:18,938 --> 01:07:21,929
Boss, Kulakarni sent you these snacks.

1245
01:07:22,009 --> 01:07:23,599
Hurry up. Start the bike.

1246
01:07:25,008 --> 01:07:26,669
Let me start.
- Let's go. Let's go.

1247
01:07:27,927 --> 01:07:30,228
What happened? What's wrong?
Why isn't the bike starting?

1248
01:07:30,946 --> 01:07:32,823
Don't worry, sir.
It will start any minute. Wait.

1249
01:07:32,903 --> 01:07:35,927
Don't worry?
What you gave them is not snacks.

1250
01:07:36,007 --> 01:07:37,760
Then?
- It is a bomb.

1251
01:07:41,661 --> 01:07:44,114
Where did he go?
- Catch him! Don't let him get away!

1252
01:07:44,487 --> 01:07:46,119
Oh God!

1253
01:07:46,617 --> 01:07:48,357
Hey! Stop! Stop!

1254
01:07:49,134 --> 01:07:50,550
Hurry up!

1255
01:07:55,891 --> 01:07:59,408
Sir! Sir! Sir?

1256
01:08:01,786 --> 01:08:03,678
Who tried to kill me with a bomb?

1257
01:08:03,758 --> 01:08:05,451
Sir, I didn't know that
there was a bomb inside.

1258
01:08:05,531 --> 01:08:06,770
Sir! Sir!

1259
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:08,649
How dare you try to kill me!

1260
01:08:08,729 --> 01:08:10,541
I'm innocent, sir.
That spirit is doing everything.

1261
01:08:10,951 --> 01:08:12,205
I will kill you!

1262
01:08:12,389 --> 01:08:14,141
Sir! Sir! Sir!
- How dare you mess with me!

1263
01:08:14,221 --> 01:08:15,503
Sir! Sir! No, sir!
- You are dead!

1264
01:08:15,583 --> 01:08:16,811
I'm innocent, sir!
- I will kill you!

1265
01:08:17,051 --> 01:08:20,067
I will kill you!
- Sir! I'm innocent, sir!

1266
01:08:20,148 --> 01:08:22,847
It will fire! It will fire!

1267
01:08:30,336 --> 01:08:32,022
Oh God!

1268
01:08:33,741 --> 01:08:39,633
Sir! Sir! Oh God!
He made me commit a murder too.

1269
01:08:47,060 --> 01:08:48,390
Why did you leave me and run?

1270
01:08:48,627 --> 01:08:50,335
I ran away because they
will kill me if I get caught.

1271
01:08:50,416 --> 01:08:51,644
You are already dead.

1272
01:08:52,100 --> 01:08:55,408
Right? I forgot that
in all that chaos.

1273
01:08:55,928 --> 01:08:57,755
Don't you have any sense?
- Why?

1274
01:08:57,835 --> 01:08:59,717
You gave me a bomb
in the name of snacks.

1275
01:08:59,796 --> 01:09:01,305
I escaped death by an inch.

1276
01:09:01,609 --> 01:09:03,438
Will you commit a
murder if I ask you to?

1277
01:09:03,631 --> 01:09:05,837
That's why I had to plan this.

1278
01:09:06,377 --> 01:09:08,107
So, your two wishes are?

1279
01:09:08,188 --> 01:09:09,719
Two murders.

1280
01:09:10,876 --> 01:09:12,973
The sweets?
- My next target.

1281
01:09:13,053 --> 01:09:16,903
Impossible. You can't
make me commit another murder.

1282
01:09:16,983 --> 01:09:18,875
Please, don't say that.

1283
01:09:19,118 --> 01:09:21,745
You will not say this
if you know how Babji is.

1284
01:09:21,973 --> 01:09:25,674
He and his gang commit
so many atrocities in Vizag city.

1285
01:09:37,455 --> 01:09:40,353
No, please! No!

1286
01:09:43,304 --> 01:09:44,904
No! No!

1287
01:09:54,158 --> 01:09:59,061
As a journalist,
I wanted to expose his crimes.

1288
01:10:04,944 --> 01:10:06,717
Unload the goods.
- Okay, boss.

1289
01:10:11,950 --> 01:10:13,269
Careful.

1290
01:10:21,894 --> 01:10:24,608
You clicked nice photos
even without proper lighting.

1291
01:10:24,688 --> 01:10:26,721
For your silly newspaper
that costs 2 rupees..

1292
01:10:26,801 --> 01:10:30,094
..you were going to make
me lose goods worth 2 billion?

1293
01:10:30,321 --> 01:10:31,457
Isn't that wrong?

1294
01:10:31,537 --> 01:10:33,900
That newspaper that costs
2 rupees has the power..

1295
01:10:34,538 --> 01:10:38,750
..to drag a CM or a PM to
the streets if he commits a crime.

1296
01:10:39,463 --> 01:10:40,501
Be ready.

1297
01:10:40,581 --> 01:10:42,977
Check him to see
if he has anything else.

1298
01:10:45,106 --> 01:10:46,371
Hey!

1299
01:10:47,079 --> 01:10:48,420
Camera.

1300
01:10:52,376 --> 01:10:53,987
Kashi!

1301
01:10:54,776 --> 01:10:56,257
Crush him!

1302
01:11:17,943 --> 01:11:22,429
Now tell me. Is it wrong
to kill the people who killed me?

1303
01:11:27,553 --> 01:11:28,710
Hey!

1304
01:11:30,232 --> 01:11:32,968
Sorry, sir.
I fall asleep when I hear stories.

1305
01:11:33,692 --> 01:11:36,222
Does my revenge sound
like a story to you?

1306
01:11:36,302 --> 01:11:39,751
Revenge? You can narrate
it to your son or daughter.

1307
01:11:39,956 --> 01:11:43,719
Sorry, there's no chance for that.
I'm a bachelor.

1308
01:11:43,799 --> 01:11:45,524
So, you have to help me.

1309
01:11:45,762 --> 01:11:47,751
I killed a man and
somehow escaped from there.

1310
01:11:47,831 --> 01:11:48,821
Don't create new problems.

1311
01:11:48,901 --> 01:11:50,408
I will not commit a second murder.

1312
01:11:53,262 --> 01:11:55,176
He is the man that died in the blast.

1313
01:11:57,468 --> 01:11:59,035
Who killed him?

1314
01:11:59,230 --> 01:12:01,633
Name is Kulakarni.
We didn't find any other details..

1315
01:12:01,713 --> 01:12:03,525
..except for his wallet and his photo.

1316
01:12:03,605 --> 01:12:06,379
He looks like a kid
but he is very dangerous.

1317
01:12:06,459 --> 01:12:07,914
Sir, we are getting late
to go to the court. Let's go.

1318
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:09,633
Ganga!
- Yes, boss?

1319
01:12:10,196 --> 01:12:12,513
List out all the gangs.
Inquire about him.

1320
01:12:12,593 --> 01:12:17,670
He shouldn't be alive
when I come out of jail.

1321
01:12:17,853 --> 01:12:19,583
You committed a murder?

1322
01:12:19,821 --> 01:12:21,118
I didn't do it.
I turned the gun towards him..

1323
01:12:21,313 --> 01:12:24,124
..when he pressed the trigger.
That's it. He died.

1324
01:12:24,204 --> 01:12:26,935
That's called murder.
Why did you go there?

1325
01:12:27,151 --> 01:12:29,638
I didn't go. He took me there.

1326
01:12:32,492 --> 01:12:35,119
He made this mess and
now he is coolly watching TV.

1327
01:12:35,778 --> 01:12:36,870
Yes!

1328
01:12:39,843 --> 01:12:42,232
I'm not watching TV
to while away my time.

1329
01:12:42,470 --> 01:12:44,632
I'm looking for new
methods to make you..

1330
01:12:45,042 --> 01:12:46,642
..commit the second murder.

1331
01:12:46,722 --> 01:12:48,847
Did you hear his cruel words?

1332
01:12:49,128 --> 01:12:51,658
What should I hear
and what should I think?

1333
01:12:52,945 --> 01:12:54,242
Who are you talking to?

1334
01:12:54,322 --> 01:12:56,384
Kulakarni who gave me his eyes.

1335
01:12:56,464 --> 01:12:57,876
Kulakarni who gave you his eyes?

1336
01:12:58,060 --> 01:12:59,519
Yes, his spirit.
- Spirit?

1337
01:12:59,876 --> 01:13:02,578
'God! Did you give him
eyes and take away his brain?'

1338
01:13:02,658 --> 01:13:04,396
Hey! The other day
you said you had a dream..

1339
01:13:04,476 --> 01:13:05,834
..and now you are
talking of Kulakarni.

1340
01:13:05,914 --> 01:13:08,169
I think you will take
your own life and my life too..

1341
01:13:08,249 --> 01:13:11,034
..with your craziness.

1342
01:13:11,380 --> 01:13:13,585
Say that to him, not me.

1343
01:13:13,665 --> 01:13:14,536
He is asking me to
commit another murder.

1344
01:13:14,616 --> 01:13:15,649
Another murder?

1345
01:13:25,581 --> 01:13:26,619
Dharma I.P.S?

1346
01:13:26,814 --> 01:13:29,581
Why did you bring me here?
Will you kill him too?

1347
01:13:29,863 --> 01:13:31,495
I want to meet Nethra.

1348
01:13:31,722 --> 01:13:34,025
Her father put her on house
arrest thinking that I'm mad.

1349
01:13:34,556 --> 01:13:37,292
I want to see her once.
- But I want to live.

1350
01:13:37,540 --> 01:13:39,108
Many people die for love.

1351
01:13:39,188 --> 01:13:42,178
Lovers die for their love.
Not their friends.

1352
01:13:43,508 --> 01:13:45,670
I will be back in ten minutes.
- But.. But, listen to me.

1353
01:13:45,750 --> 01:13:48,344
You are going for your love.
I know I will die.

1354
01:13:59,381 --> 01:14:00,408
Nethra!

1355
01:14:00,625 --> 01:14:01,825
Gautham?

1356
01:14:02,181 --> 01:14:04,549
What happened to you?
My dad thinks you are crazy.

1357
01:14:05,085 --> 01:14:06,706
Why did you say you saw a dead man?

1358
01:14:06,786 --> 01:14:07,658
Actually..

1359
01:14:07,738 --> 01:14:09,463
Why did you behave like
that in the hospital that day?

1360
01:14:09,543 --> 01:14:10,652
Are you really mad?

1361
01:14:10,732 --> 01:14:13,225
No, not at all. Since I
got my eyesight all of a sudden..

1362
01:14:13,409 --> 01:14:14,933
..it was a hallucination
induced by my imagination.

1363
01:14:15,013 --> 01:14:15,852
That's all. Now everything is perfect.

1364
01:14:15,932 --> 01:14:17,268
You don't have a problem now?

1365
01:14:17,852 --> 01:14:20,187
I don't have a problem now?
- No.

1366
01:14:20,598 --> 01:14:23,657
I don't have a problem now?

1367
01:14:23,841 --> 01:14:24,836
No.

1368
01:14:25,222 --> 01:14:27,806
No problem?
- No.

1369
01:14:45,023 --> 01:14:48,558
"Lover! Lover!"

1370
01:14:48,742 --> 01:14:52,418
"Your companionship is a celebration."

1371
01:14:52,602 --> 01:14:56,223
"I don't want any
distance between us."

1372
01:14:56,303 --> 01:14:59,943
"Our union is a gift for me."

1373
01:15:00,023 --> 01:15:07,359
"Don't stay beyond reach.
Don't stay within limits."

1374
01:15:07,439 --> 01:15:13,607
"Find time for me.
This moon belongs to you."

1375
01:15:15,045 --> 01:15:18,180
"Wanna.. Wanna be with you."

1376
01:15:18,688 --> 01:15:21,975
"Wanna be with you forever."

1377
01:15:22,407 --> 01:15:25,704
"Wanna.. Wanna be with you."

1378
01:15:26,029 --> 01:15:29,510
"Wanna be with you forever."

1379
01:15:30,028 --> 01:15:33,164
"Lover! Lover!"

1380
01:15:33,618 --> 01:15:37,110
"Your companionship is a celebration."

1381
01:15:55,790 --> 01:16:03,239
"One you. One me.
There is nobody else in our world."

1382
01:16:03,319 --> 01:16:10,720
"There is no space between
us even for light breeze."

1383
01:16:11,314 --> 01:16:18,644
"My luscious lips
are glazed with honey."

1384
01:16:18,881 --> 01:16:26,103
"Lover, come to me. Caress my cheeks."

1385
01:16:26,330 --> 01:16:29,465
"Wanna.. Wanna be with you."

1386
01:16:30,006 --> 01:16:33,195
"Wanna be with you forever."

1387
01:16:33,747 --> 01:16:37,487
"Wanna.. Wanna be with you."

1388
01:16:37,567 --> 01:16:41,109
"Wanna be with you forever."

1389
01:16:55,822 --> 01:17:03,249
"I won't let this
night end in this world."

1390
01:17:03,422 --> 01:17:10,817
"I'll make this night stay
with us for a hundred years."

1391
01:17:11,249 --> 01:17:18,557
"This passion has taken
hold of our hearts."

1392
01:17:18,752 --> 01:17:26,178
"There is no looking back for us now."

1393
01:17:26,362 --> 01:17:29,756
"Wanna.. Wanna be with you."

1394
01:17:30,027 --> 01:17:33,746
"Wanna be with you forever."

1395
01:17:33,826 --> 01:17:36,892
"Wanna.. Wanna be with you."

1396
01:17:37,486 --> 01:17:40,665
"Wanna be with you forever."

1397
01:17:48,732 --> 01:17:51,338
30 seconds for a hug
and 2 minutes for a kiss.

1398
01:17:51,418 --> 01:17:53,403
This idiot has been gone
for 15 minutes now. So..

1399
01:17:57,233 --> 01:17:58,000
What was that sound?

1400
01:17:58,080 --> 01:17:59,373
Nothing, dad.
- Really?

1401
01:17:59,453 --> 01:18:00,606
Hmm.

1402
01:18:02,778 --> 01:18:03,762
Okay.

1403
01:18:14,752 --> 01:18:15,995
Hello!
- You have been gone for 20 minutes.

1404
01:18:16,075 --> 01:18:18,400
What are you doing? Come soon.

1405
01:18:18,594 --> 01:18:19,751
You also come upstairs.

1406
01:18:28,086 --> 01:18:29,707
Dad, your gun.

1407
01:18:34,161 --> 01:18:36,360
I told you that you'll die
if you come to see my daughter.

1408
01:18:36,440 --> 01:18:37,441
Why did you come?

1409
01:18:37,521 --> 01:18:39,204
Because I felt death is
better than staying away from her.

1410
01:18:39,539 --> 01:18:40,814
That's why I came.

1411
01:18:41,906 --> 01:18:43,387
How dare you!

1412
01:18:43,467 --> 01:18:45,268
Oh dear! Don't harm him.

1413
01:18:45,348 --> 01:18:47,236
All my hopes are pinned on him.

1414
01:18:47,757 --> 01:18:50,276
Be patient until he
commits that second murder.

1415
01:18:50,356 --> 01:18:52,590
Then you can chop him into pieces.
I don't mind.

1416
01:18:52,670 --> 01:18:53,984
Will you stop your crying?

1417
01:18:54,200 --> 01:18:56,060
Who are you talking to?

1418
01:18:56,140 --> 01:18:57,768
I was talking to your daughter, sir.
- Daughter?

1419
01:19:01,474 --> 01:19:02,999
She didn't cry.

1420
01:19:03,388 --> 01:19:05,474
I thought she will cry.
So, I said it as a precaution.

1421
01:19:05,554 --> 01:19:07,139
Why did you love this mad man?

1422
01:19:07,219 --> 01:19:08,696
Yes, sir. I'm mad.

1423
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:12,789
But not like you think.
I'm mad about your daughter.

1424
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:15,438
If you think I'm mad
for imagining things..

1425
01:19:15,632 --> 01:19:17,448
..you are mad too for
not seeing my true love.

1426
01:19:17,686 --> 01:19:20,244
Yes, he is mad.
- Mother!

1427
01:19:20,324 --> 01:19:23,981
He is madly in love with
your daughter. Don't call him mad.

1428
01:19:24,205 --> 01:19:29,729
Your father left the Salt
March and came back for me.

1429
01:19:30,799 --> 01:19:32,745
He left the Salt March
for this old woman?

1430
01:19:32,825 --> 01:19:35,059
The Salt..
- Will you stop with your salt nonsense?

1431
01:19:35,232 --> 01:19:36,756
So you think he is not mad?

1432
01:19:36,836 --> 01:19:41,397
You will stay here for a week.
Everyone will observe you.

1433
01:19:41,477 --> 01:19:44,446
Me too. If you talk to
the air in this one week..

1434
01:19:44,526 --> 01:19:48,399
..or behave like a crazy man,
I will throw you out.

1435
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:50,540
You should never think
about him in your life again.

1436
01:19:50,777 --> 01:19:52,561
Are you okay with this?

1437
01:19:53,512 --> 01:19:56,645
Wow! What a condition!
Now your remote is in my hand.

1438
01:19:56,725 --> 01:19:58,472
You have to stab if I ask you to stab.

1439
01:19:58,656 --> 01:20:01,542
You have to shoot
if I tell you to shoot.

1440
01:20:01,622 --> 01:20:04,991
Otherwise I'll make
you look crazy before them.

1441
01:20:07,394 --> 01:20:09,913
Hey, mad man!
What are you thinking about?

1442
01:20:10,811 --> 01:20:12,021
I'm okay with it, sir.

1443
01:20:18,702 --> 01:20:20,378
This is exactly what I wanted.

1444
01:20:21,891 --> 01:20:24,205
You already committed
a murder this morning.

1445
01:20:24,285 --> 01:20:25,567
Now you have challenged this man.

1446
01:20:25,647 --> 01:20:27,737
I'm scared that you'll
harm them tomorrow morning.

1447
01:20:27,817 --> 01:20:30,407
This is not craziness.
This is my planning.

1448
01:20:30,580 --> 01:20:33,435
This is the right thing
to do to keep me and my love safe.

1449
01:20:33,515 --> 01:20:38,111
Don't worry about Kulakarni,
I know how to get rid of him.

1450
01:20:38,490 --> 01:20:40,219
Oh dear! He is talking
about Kulakarni again.

1451
01:20:40,299 --> 01:20:41,549
God! What is this torture?

1452
01:20:41,629 --> 01:20:43,279
Hey!
- Sorry, sir.

1453
01:20:49,853 --> 01:20:51,053
Hi, uncle!

1454
01:20:57,011 --> 01:20:58,275
What is all this?

1455
01:20:58,524 --> 01:21:00,740
This is Misamma. This is Pochamma.

1456
01:21:00,946 --> 01:21:02,686
This is Pedhamma.
- My grandmother!

1457
01:21:02,957 --> 01:21:05,292
Mad man! Why didn't you
go to Kadapa Dargah as well?

1458
01:21:05,372 --> 01:21:06,329
That's here, uncle.

1459
01:21:07,344 --> 01:21:09,808
He has so much devotion
at such a young age.

1460
01:21:10,100 --> 01:21:12,998
That is fear, not devotion.

1461
01:21:13,078 --> 01:21:15,084
Does this look like
a house to you or a temple?

1462
01:21:15,376 --> 01:21:16,435
Remove them.

1463
01:21:16,932 --> 01:21:18,911
Remove them, son.
You look like a sorcerer.

1464
01:21:19,127 --> 01:21:20,759
Do it. Remove them.

1465
01:21:21,105 --> 01:21:22,392
He will be back if I remove them.

1466
01:21:22,565 --> 01:21:23,700
Who will be back?

1467
01:21:24,316 --> 01:21:25,862
Bad luck.
- It is already here.

1468
01:21:25,942 --> 01:21:27,257
You are the most
ill-fated person on earth.

1469
01:21:27,337 --> 01:21:28,633
Remove them.

1470
01:21:36,049 --> 01:21:38,265
You tried to get rid of me, right?

1471
01:21:38,951 --> 01:21:41,134
You are finished.
- Show him his room.

1472
01:21:41,214 --> 01:21:43,210
Hey, not you.

1473
01:21:43,488 --> 01:21:44,939
Gurudev, show him his room.

1474
01:21:48,652 --> 01:21:50,219
This is your room.

1475
01:21:55,192 --> 01:22:00,418
Wow! This is a comfortable
place for spirits. I like it.

1476
01:22:00,498 --> 01:22:02,191
I hate it.

1477
01:22:04,796 --> 01:22:08,044
Do you call this a room?
This is a dumping yard.

1478
01:22:08,124 --> 01:22:09,763
You got that right.

1479
01:22:11,644 --> 01:22:12,692
What is that smell?

1480
01:22:12,887 --> 01:22:14,833
That's my old bed. I peed on it.

1481
01:22:15,741 --> 01:22:18,863
All his sweet memories are in it.

1482
01:22:18,943 --> 01:22:21,371
Can any human being stay here?

1483
01:22:21,598 --> 01:22:23,846
You usually imagine
things that don't exist.

1484
01:22:24,063 --> 01:22:28,531
Imagine that this sofa as a bed,
this window as an AC..

1485
01:22:28,611 --> 01:22:32,698
..and this tap water
as distilled water.

1486
01:22:34,249 --> 01:22:36,539
Instead of imagining
some unknown man..

1487
01:22:36,619 --> 01:22:39,164
..if you just imagine
that my sister is with you..

1488
01:22:39,244 --> 01:22:40,965
..there won't be any problem at all.

1489
01:22:41,334 --> 01:22:42,951
Sir, coffee.
- Give that to me.

1490
01:22:44,177 --> 01:22:45,522
Imagine that you drank it.

1491
01:22:45,602 --> 01:22:47,258
You! Come with me!
- Okay, sir.

1492
01:22:50,417 --> 01:22:52,143
What kind of a life is this?

1493
01:22:52,327 --> 01:22:54,410
I told you to murder
that man and become a hero.

1494
01:22:54,490 --> 01:22:57,459
But instead you chose to
be insulted by this little kid.

1495
01:22:57,643 --> 01:22:59,437
Look! No matter how
much you provoke me..

1496
01:22:59,517 --> 01:23:01,162
..I won't do another murder.
You can't make me do it.

1497
01:23:01,242 --> 01:23:03,094
I don't care what you say or do.

1498
01:23:03,564 --> 01:23:05,600
If a living man can be so obstinate..

1499
01:23:05,788 --> 01:23:07,492
..imagine how obstinate
a dead man can be.

1500
01:23:08,056 --> 01:23:13,003
You are finished.
I will make you commit that murder.

1501
01:23:22,062 --> 01:23:23,169
Son! 'Puri'?

1502
01:23:27,778 --> 01:23:28,733
No, I don't want it.

1503
01:23:28,972 --> 01:23:29,709
Will you have 'Wada'?

1504
01:23:31,435 --> 01:23:32,693
I don't want it.

1505
01:23:37,273 --> 01:23:43,705
"Listen, brother!
This is our handsome hero's story."

1506
01:23:45,661 --> 01:23:49,683
"Listen, brother!
This is our handsome hero's story."

1507
01:23:49,763 --> 01:23:53,661
"He became a puppet
in a ghost's hands."

1508
01:24:10,406 --> 01:24:16,600
"I doubt how his future will be."

1509
01:24:18,482 --> 01:24:22,493
"The ghost is dangerous.
He is playing tricks."

1510
01:24:22,666 --> 01:24:26,698
"He is making this handsome
hero's life miserable."

1511
01:24:55,952 --> 01:24:57,984
"He looks funny."

1512
01:24:59,865 --> 01:25:02,417
"He tortures the
very life out of you."

1513
01:25:04,028 --> 01:25:08,028
"He is controlling this hero's life."

1514
01:25:08,108 --> 01:25:12,439
"He is bringing this
handsome man to his knees."

1515
01:25:51,148 --> 01:25:54,392
Why are you sitting like
a man who lost his wife?

1516
01:25:54,472 --> 01:25:55,911
I'm losing my dignity.
Isn't that enough?

1517
01:25:56,096 --> 01:25:58,548
I lost my life.
Who should I complain to?

1518
01:25:58,933 --> 01:26:02,329
This is just the warm-up match.

1519
01:26:02,409 --> 01:26:04,163
I haven't started the series yet.

1520
01:26:04,243 --> 01:26:08,297
I can't do this anymore.
Let's come to an understanding.

1521
01:26:08,547 --> 01:26:09,675
First let me make my love a success..

1522
01:26:09,755 --> 01:26:11,183
..then I will see about your revenge.

1523
01:26:11,263 --> 01:26:15,968
Don't think you can trick
me with your smooth words.

1524
01:26:16,738 --> 01:26:18,106
You don't believe me
when I tell you the truth.

1525
01:26:18,186 --> 01:26:20,425
You don't leave me alone too.
What should I do with you?

1526
01:26:21,397 --> 01:26:23,836
I swear on the girl I love.
Are you happy?

1527
01:26:23,916 --> 01:26:26,871
Alright then. I will help
you to gain the girl you love..

1528
01:26:26,951 --> 01:26:28,903
..instead of causing trouble.

1529
01:26:29,211 --> 01:26:31,211
You'll have no problems from me.

1530
01:26:31,291 --> 01:26:34,263
Take this.
- Is this Kulakarni your gang member?

1531
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:36,297
No.

1532
01:26:36,857 --> 01:26:38,654
Boss! Kulakarni is not
a part of Shankar's gang.

1533
01:26:38,734 --> 01:26:40,569
Find him. Find him.

1534
01:26:56,257 --> 01:26:58,562
Why are you drawing
lines on the wall, Babji?

1535
01:26:58,642 --> 01:27:01,288
Are you counting how
many days are left in jail?

1536
01:27:01,542 --> 01:27:03,373
You will be permanently here now.

1537
01:27:04,628 --> 01:27:06,781
I gathered evidences against
all the crimes you did..

1538
01:27:06,861 --> 01:27:10,731
..and created a file. I'm
going to submit in court in 4 days.

1539
01:27:11,002 --> 01:27:12,952
Then your fate will be sealed.

1540
01:27:19,588 --> 01:27:22,250
Why are you smiling, sir?
He will do what he said.

1541
01:27:22,330 --> 01:27:24,594
He knows that he has
that file in his house.

1542
01:27:24,843 --> 01:27:28,336
He doesn't know that I
bought a servant in his house..

1543
01:27:28,641 --> 01:27:30,353
..to steal that file for me.

1544
01:27:32,564 --> 01:27:35,022
Darn! What happened to that file?

1545
01:27:35,102 --> 01:27:36,514
Why did you ask me to steal this file?

1546
01:27:36,594 --> 01:27:38,819
I heard your father in
law tell your mother in law..

1547
01:27:38,899 --> 01:27:41,142
..that this is a very important file.

1548
01:27:41,413 --> 01:27:46,592
When he doesn't find this
file and becomes worried..

1549
01:27:46,897 --> 01:27:47,999
..coolly go to him and say..

1550
01:27:48,079 --> 01:27:51,068
..'Uncle! Is this the file?
It was lying outside'..

1551
01:27:51,148 --> 01:27:54,018
..'so I kept it safe thinking
that it might be an important file.'

1552
01:27:54,391 --> 01:27:57,747
That's it. Your father in
law will look at you adoringly..

1553
01:27:58,002 --> 01:28:00,870
..like you are the new
2,000 rupee note in the market.

1554
01:28:00,950 --> 01:28:03,396
After that?
- He will marry you.

1555
01:28:03,594 --> 01:28:05,569
Sir?
- Isn't it obvious?

1556
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:08,130
He will start having positive vibes..

1557
01:28:08,323 --> 01:28:09,961
..about you instead
of having negative vibes.

1558
01:28:10,276 --> 01:28:12,283
Sir! Even though
they burnt your body..

1559
01:28:12,363 --> 01:28:14,149
..your brain is still very sharp.

1560
01:28:14,388 --> 01:28:16,656
I'm glad you realized that.
Go do your work.

1561
01:28:18,829 --> 01:28:20,456
Is it safe?
- Yes.

1562
01:28:22,290 --> 01:28:23,570
Your idea is superb, sir.

1563
01:28:23,776 --> 01:28:25,577
But why should I impress her family?

1564
01:28:27,574 --> 01:28:28,691
Who are you talking to?

1565
01:28:32,259 --> 01:28:34,733
Bluetooth. Kishore. Yes, tell me.
- Is it? Give it to me.

1566
01:28:36,784 --> 01:28:38,423
Okay, talk to you later. Bye.

1567
01:28:39,464 --> 01:28:40,961
I need to talk to you.

1568
01:28:46,484 --> 01:28:48,687
Do you really know what you are doing?

1569
01:28:48,767 --> 01:28:51,171
It is okay if you
don't impress my family..

1570
01:28:51,251 --> 01:28:53,243
..but don't appear like
a fool in front of them.

1571
01:28:55,023 --> 01:28:58,474
Usually parents test their
son in law to see if he is good.

1572
01:28:58,554 --> 01:29:01,295
But in your case, they are
testing to see if you are mad.

1573
01:29:01,375 --> 01:29:03,150
If this continues..
- It won't.

1574
01:29:03,599 --> 01:29:06,052
Definitely not.
We came to a compromise.

1575
01:29:06,132 --> 01:29:07,364
Compromise? With who?

1576
01:29:08,449 --> 01:29:11,476
Your mother,
grandmother and fat brother.

1577
01:29:11,556 --> 01:29:13,885
Only your father is left.
I've a master-plan to impress him.

1578
01:29:13,965 --> 01:29:15,111
Don't worry.
- Hi, everyone!

1579
01:29:15,191 --> 01:29:16,511
Attention please!

1580
01:29:16,591 --> 01:29:18,844
We are conducting a
selfie contest to promote..

1581
01:29:18,924 --> 01:29:20,829
..our brand new mobile.

1582
01:29:20,909 --> 01:29:23,238
If you take the best selfie..

1583
01:29:23,318 --> 01:29:26,161
We will gift them
a car worth 1 million!

1584
01:29:26,241 --> 01:29:27,669
Are you ready, guys?
- Are you ready, guys?

1585
01:29:27,749 --> 01:29:29,351
Ready.
- We are ready.

1586
01:29:39,304 --> 01:29:40,563
Kulakarni!

1587
01:29:40,643 --> 01:29:42,060
Where is this man?

1588
01:29:42,440 --> 01:29:44,024
He went this way, sir.

1589
01:30:01,294 --> 01:30:04,592
You are like buffaloes.
Can't you catch a single man?

1590
01:30:04,672 --> 01:30:06,252
We found his phone number, boss.

1591
01:30:09,549 --> 01:30:10,754
Bye.

1592
01:30:12,804 --> 01:30:15,115
Hello!
- Pantham Babji.

1593
01:30:16,372 --> 01:30:19,030
You are coolly going around
the city with your lover..

1594
01:30:19,110 --> 01:30:20,549
..after killing my man?

1595
01:30:20,629 --> 01:30:23,544
Do you think you can
survive after targeting me?

1596
01:30:25,041 --> 01:30:27,265
I will bring you out from your hiding.

1597
01:30:27,596 --> 01:30:29,625
Should I describe your death to you?

1598
01:30:45,649 --> 01:30:46,853
You..

1599
01:30:47,027 --> 01:30:48,676
Pantham Babji found my number.

1600
01:30:49,078 --> 01:30:50,988
He explained in great
detail how he will kill me.

1601
01:30:51,454 --> 01:30:56,369
There's only one way
to get out of this alive.

1602
01:30:56,449 --> 01:30:57,639
What is that, sir?

1603
01:30:57,719 --> 01:31:00,486
Kill him before he kills you.

1604
01:31:01,113 --> 01:31:03,058
Do you have a conscience?

1605
01:31:03,275 --> 01:31:06,508
I'm scared that he will kill
me and you want me to kill him.

1606
01:31:06,588 --> 01:31:08,966
There is no other way out of this.

1607
01:31:09,046 --> 01:31:10,398
How can the file go missing?

1608
01:31:10,478 --> 01:31:13,620
I kept it safely.
But I can't find it now.

1609
01:31:15,790 --> 01:31:18,286
How can you tell me so
coolly that the file is missing?

1610
01:31:19,887 --> 01:31:22,621
Uncle, that file is with me.

1611
01:31:24,130 --> 01:31:26,473
I saw it lying on the table,
so I kept it safely with me..

1612
01:31:26,553 --> 01:31:27,764
..assuming that it
must be an important file.

1613
01:31:27,844 --> 01:31:30,140
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Go bring it.

1614
01:31:30,545 --> 01:31:32,140
Okay.
- Good boy.

1615
01:31:38,998 --> 01:31:39,985
Where is the file?

1616
01:31:43,289 --> 01:31:44,439
It is not here.

1617
01:31:44,819 --> 01:31:45,904
It is missing?

1618
01:31:49,495 --> 01:31:50,841
Where is the file?

1619
01:31:50,921 --> 01:31:53,281
The file is missing, uncle.
- It is missing?

1620
01:31:53,685 --> 01:31:56,408
It is missing?
Do you know how valuable that file is?

1621
01:31:58,095 --> 01:32:00,135
And how did you know
that it is an important file?

1622
01:32:00,215 --> 01:32:02,642
Actually..
- Answer me.

1623
01:32:02,722 --> 01:32:04,649
In order to impress you..

1624
01:32:04,729 --> 01:32:06,276
..it was Kulkarni's idea to steal it.

1625
01:32:06,482 --> 01:32:08,609
Huh? Kulakarni?

1626
01:32:08,796 --> 01:32:11,487
The one who gave his eyes to me.
His spirit is here.

1627
01:32:11,747 --> 01:32:12,745
Spirit?

1628
01:32:14,557 --> 01:32:18,137
Did you hear that?
He can see a spirit.

1629
01:32:18,549 --> 01:32:19,592
Do you believe that he is mad?

1630
01:32:21,583 --> 01:32:22,894
Because of your craziness..

1631
01:32:23,044 --> 01:32:26,742
..a dangerous criminal
will get out of jail tomorrow.

1632
01:32:26,959 --> 01:32:29,415
This is what happened
when he stayed here a week.

1633
01:32:29,495 --> 01:32:31,811
So, imagine what will happen
if he stays here forever.

1634
01:32:34,504 --> 01:32:36,049
Nethra, believe me. I'm not mad.

1635
01:32:36,129 --> 01:32:38,358
Hey, stop it.
- I can really see his spirit.

1636
01:32:41,580 --> 01:32:43,663
I can really see his spirit.

1637
01:32:46,198 --> 01:32:49,036
He is right, sir. Trust him.

1638
01:32:49,652 --> 01:32:51,091
Consult a good doctor, Gautham.

1639
01:32:57,856 --> 01:32:59,887
I won't raise my hand
on a mad man like you.

1640
01:33:00,798 --> 01:33:02,083
Get out of my house.

1641
01:33:03,723 --> 01:33:05,138
He says he sees a spirit.

1642
01:33:06,763 --> 01:33:07,821
Hey!

1643
01:33:08,203 --> 01:33:10,434
I'm sorry.
I didn't expect this to happen.

1644
01:33:10,514 --> 01:33:13,828
Don't say a word.
You made me look like a crazy man..

1645
01:33:13,908 --> 01:33:15,510
..to my lover and her family.

1646
01:33:15,987 --> 01:33:17,637
And that gangster
will kill me very soon.

1647
01:33:18,973 --> 01:33:20,909
I imagined great things for
my life after getting my eyesight.

1648
01:33:21,352 --> 01:33:23,131
Did you let at least
one of my dreams come true?

1649
01:33:24,250 --> 01:33:26,698
You died in the blink of an eye.

1650
01:33:27,453 --> 01:33:30,526
Do you know how painful
it is to lose the person you love?

1651
01:33:31,153 --> 01:33:34,017
Forget it. I'm facing all
these problems because of my eyes.

1652
01:33:34,217 --> 01:33:35,892
I won't be able to see
you if I don't have these eyes.

1653
01:33:36,378 --> 01:33:37,576
I will get them removed.

1654
01:33:37,656 --> 01:33:39,251
What are you saying?

1655
01:33:39,331 --> 01:33:40,896
I lived without eyesight for 25 years.

1656
01:33:40,976 --> 01:33:42,128
Can't I live another 25 years?

1657
01:33:42,208 --> 01:33:45,679
I don't want your eyes.
I will get them removed tomorrow.

1658
01:33:45,878 --> 01:33:47,059
Hey! Hey!

1659
01:33:51,933 --> 01:33:53,061
Now tell me, sir.

1660
01:33:53,141 --> 01:33:54,580
Is it right to remove my eyes or not?

1661
01:33:55,396 --> 01:33:59,469
It took time for me
to believe what you said.

1662
01:33:59,756 --> 01:34:01,935
How will they believe you so easily?

1663
01:34:03,107 --> 01:34:06,414
Look! You shouldn't take
a rash decision in this matter.

1664
01:34:06,934 --> 01:34:08,610
Come and meet me tomorrow.
Then we will talk.

1665
01:34:08,835 --> 01:34:11,077
There's no talking, sir.
Just do as I say.

1666
01:34:12,136 --> 01:34:13,985
Where do you stay?

1667
01:34:14,176 --> 01:34:15,747
MVP Complex.
- I will drop you home.

1668
01:34:15,946 --> 01:34:18,290
No, sir. I will go.
Bye, sir.

1669
01:34:25,703 --> 01:34:26,753
What is it, doctor?

1670
01:34:26,833 --> 01:34:28,325
Why did you suddenly think of me?

1671
01:34:28,405 --> 01:34:29,992
I need to talk to you about Gautham.

1672
01:34:30,252 --> 01:34:33,117
He is crazy.
What is there to talk about him?

1673
01:34:33,603 --> 01:34:36,260
We have to talk.
If a person suddenly starts behaving..

1674
01:34:36,340 --> 01:34:40,392
..like a crazy man,
there will be a strong reason for it.

1675
01:34:40,583 --> 01:34:44,289
Do you know the reason
for Gautham's craziness?

1676
01:34:44,502 --> 01:34:45,839
A spirit.

1677
01:34:47,610 --> 01:34:51,524
Yes, he can really see a spirit.

1678
01:34:51,604 --> 01:34:53,551
How can he see a spirit?
That's foolish.

1679
01:34:53,631 --> 01:34:55,643
You studied science,
do you believe this?

1680
01:34:55,723 --> 01:35:01,686
Yes. Because science has
no answers for many questions.

1681
01:35:03,096 --> 01:35:05,266
What do you actually
know about Gautham?

1682
01:35:13,874 --> 01:35:15,592
If he is not seeing a spirit..

1683
01:35:15,757 --> 01:35:18,691
..how does he know
so much about Kulakarni?

1684
01:35:19,473 --> 01:35:22,033
Why would he want to appear
like a fool before you..

1685
01:35:22,113 --> 01:35:23,839
..by saying that he can see a spirit?

1686
01:35:23,919 --> 01:35:26,495
That's true. Without realizing
that you insulted him..

1687
01:35:26,677 --> 01:35:28,587
..by calling him a mad man.

1688
01:35:29,949 --> 01:35:32,640
You forbid him from
seeing your daughter.

1689
01:35:33,482 --> 01:35:35,531
He doesn't want his eyesight
if he can't see your daughter..

1690
01:35:35,839 --> 01:35:40,266
..so he came to me
to get his eyes removed.

1691
01:35:42,245 --> 01:35:43,087
Oh.

1692
01:35:43,167 --> 01:35:48,745
He didn't do a single
mistake on his own till now.

1693
01:35:49,995 --> 01:35:52,573
That spirit made him do those things.

1694
01:35:58,327 --> 01:36:01,035
Hello!
- Gautham, I have good news for you.

1695
01:36:01,115 --> 01:36:02,049
What is that, sir?

1696
01:36:02,129 --> 01:36:04,853
Your father in law is a close
friend to me. I spoke to him.

1697
01:36:05,165 --> 01:36:07,396
You don't have to get
your eyes removed now.

1698
01:36:07,709 --> 01:36:09,028
Thank you, sir. Thank you very much.

1699
01:36:09,108 --> 01:36:11,122
You will gain your love now.

1700
01:36:11,202 --> 01:36:12,893
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

1701
01:36:27,219 --> 01:36:30,592
"Mind-blowing, baby! Mind-blowing!"

1702
01:36:30,672 --> 01:36:34,030
"Your super-duper
glamour is mind-blowing."

1703
01:36:34,110 --> 01:36:37,122
"Let's meet. Come, let's date."

1704
01:36:37,202 --> 01:36:40,906
"Let's skip the theories
and start practicing our love."

1705
01:36:40,986 --> 01:36:43,015
"Like Physics in B.Com.."

1706
01:36:43,095 --> 01:36:46,463
"..where is your waist, my darling?"

1707
01:36:47,274 --> 01:36:49,425
"Like Physics in B.Com.."

1708
01:36:49,505 --> 01:36:51,220
"..where is your waist, my darling?"

1709
01:36:51,300 --> 01:36:55,447
"Whether it is tiny or large,
my waist belongs to you."

1710
01:36:55,782 --> 01:36:59,144
"Handsome is here to play.
He is here to hunt at dusk."

1711
01:36:59,224 --> 01:37:00,917
"He sprayed perfume from Gulf."

1712
01:37:00,997 --> 01:37:02,388
"He has jasmines wrapped
around his wrists."

1713
01:37:02,468 --> 01:37:05,934
"Handsome is here to play.
He is here to hunt at dusk."

1714
01:37:06,014 --> 01:37:07,674
"He sprayed perfume from Gulf."

1715
01:37:07,754 --> 01:37:09,966
"He has jasmines wrapped
around his wrists."

1716
01:37:16,570 --> 01:37:20,278
"I'll become a cell phone
and pinch your chubby cheeks."

1717
01:37:23,457 --> 01:37:27,230
"If you touch me, I'll come
to life like a touch-screen."

1718
01:37:30,538 --> 01:37:34,095
"I will come like Rambo,
filled with energy from Red Bull.."

1719
01:37:34,175 --> 01:37:37,468
"..and enjoy all your
beauty to my satisfaction."

1720
01:37:37,548 --> 01:37:40,679
"I'll wait for you and welcome you.."

1721
01:37:40,759 --> 01:37:44,290
"..I'll give you green
signals all your way."

1722
01:37:45,523 --> 01:37:48,917
"Handsome is here to play.
He is here to hunt at dusk."

1723
01:37:48,997 --> 01:37:50,625
"He sprayed perfume from Gulf."

1724
01:37:50,705 --> 01:37:52,478
"He has jasmines wrapped
around his wrists."

1725
01:37:52,558 --> 01:37:55,808
"Handsome is here to play.
He is here to hunt at dusk."

1726
01:37:55,888 --> 01:37:57,494
"He sprayed perfume from Gulf."

1727
01:37:57,574 --> 01:38:00,727
"He has jasmines wrapped
around his wrists."

1728
01:38:06,900 --> 01:38:10,252
"Your beautiful body is
like a tsunami filled with fire."

1729
01:38:13,548 --> 01:38:17,127
"The man inside is
you is my sweet enemy."

1730
01:38:20,611 --> 01:38:23,994
"Every day spent with you
is like a carnival, Baby Doll."

1731
01:38:24,074 --> 01:38:27,475
"I want to have candle
light dinners with you."

1732
01:38:27,555 --> 01:38:30,470
"Having fun with you
adds spice to my life."

1733
01:38:30,550 --> 01:38:34,622
"I want you to play
Candy Crush with my beauty."

1734
01:38:34,702 --> 01:38:38,028
"Handsome is here to play.
He is here to hunt at dusk."

1735
01:38:38,108 --> 01:38:39,736
"He sprayed perfume from Gulf."

1736
01:38:39,816 --> 01:38:41,607
"He has jasmines wrapped
around his wrists."

1737
01:38:41,687 --> 01:38:44,893
"Handsome is here to play.
He is here to hunt at dusk."

1738
01:38:44,973 --> 01:38:46,645
"He sprayed perfume from Gulf."

1739
01:38:46,725 --> 01:38:49,369
"He has jasmines wrapped
around his wrists."

1740
01:38:52,313 --> 01:38:53,478
Hey!

1741
01:38:55,576 --> 01:38:57,712
You don't worry. I'll take care.

1742
01:39:03,441 --> 01:39:06,666
Ranjith Kulakarni is an industrialist?
What is this?

1743
01:39:11,518 --> 01:39:12,811
Hey, stop the car.

1744
01:39:15,423 --> 01:39:16,490
Please come.

1745
01:39:18,886 --> 01:39:20,353
Excuse me.
- Yes?

1746
01:39:20,433 --> 01:39:22,227
Is he not a journalist?

1747
01:39:22,401 --> 01:39:24,614
You are mistaken.
He is a famous businessman.

1748
01:39:25,234 --> 01:39:26,293
A businessman?

1749
01:39:26,373 --> 01:39:31,058
As a journalist,
I wanted to expose his crimes.

1750
01:39:31,501 --> 01:39:34,377
Then, who are they?

1751
01:39:36,373 --> 01:39:38,100
They are his family members.

1752
01:39:38,180 --> 01:39:39,177
Family members?

1753
01:39:39,784 --> 01:39:41,234
I'm a bachelor.

1754
01:39:41,314 --> 01:39:42,478
Last month,
while returning from abroad..

1755
01:39:42,558 --> 01:39:44,101
..he died of a heart attack.

1756
01:39:44,181 --> 01:39:45,152
Heart attack?

1757
01:39:46,757 --> 01:39:47,764
'He died in an accident.'

1758
01:39:48,085 --> 01:39:49,361
Okay, thank you.

1759
01:39:49,991 --> 01:39:51,803
'Something is wrong.'

1760
01:39:53,550 --> 01:39:56,197
The number you are calling is
switched off. - Darn!

1761
01:39:57,933 --> 01:39:59,018
Where do you stay?

1762
01:39:59,098 --> 01:40:01,857
MVP Complex.
- Driver, take me to MVP Complex.

1763
01:40:11,884 --> 01:40:15,171
How dare you kill our Kashi!

1764
01:40:15,388 --> 01:40:17,656
Bring him down.

1765
01:40:22,948 --> 01:40:25,075
We found Kulakarni, boss.

1766
01:40:29,979 --> 01:40:33,027
Who are you? Why did you target me?

1767
01:40:34,069 --> 01:40:35,892
I have nothing against you, sir.

1768
01:40:35,972 --> 01:40:38,138
I'm just a radio jockey, sir.

1769
01:40:38,376 --> 01:40:40,015
I don't have the means
to fight against you.

1770
01:40:40,095 --> 01:40:41,458
That spirit is making
me do these things, sir.

1771
01:40:46,239 --> 01:40:48,691
Boss, he has been telling
the same story to us.

1772
01:40:48,771 --> 01:40:50,970
He won't tell us the truth. Kill him!

1773
01:40:51,050 --> 01:40:55,668
Sir! Sir!
Sir! I'm innocent, sir. Please, sir.

1774
01:40:55,748 --> 01:40:58,391
That spirit made me do it.
I really don't know anything.

1775
01:40:58,471 --> 01:41:03,451
No, sir. I beg of you.
I don't know anything, sir.

1776
01:41:03,531 --> 01:41:05,686
I'm innocent, sir. Please let me go, sir.
- Kill him!

1777
01:41:17,812 --> 01:41:19,570
Hey! Hey!

1778
01:43:04,900 --> 01:43:07,200
Hey, no! No! Don't kill him!

1779
01:43:18,429 --> 01:43:19,894
Who are you?

1780
01:43:19,974 --> 01:43:22,677
Are you a policeman?
Are you a gangster?

1781
01:43:22,757 --> 01:43:24,261
Enemy.

1782
01:43:24,478 --> 01:43:26,214
Enemy?

1783
01:43:26,670 --> 01:43:30,912
I'm your enemy. I killed Kashi.

1784
01:43:31,227 --> 01:43:32,345
You are dead.

1785
01:43:32,425 --> 01:43:33,364
You said there is a spirit.

1786
01:43:33,603 --> 01:43:35,231
Spirit my foot.

1787
01:43:35,311 --> 01:43:36,652
I came to kill you.

1788
01:43:40,460 --> 01:43:42,695
I'm going to get you out of jail.

1789
01:43:43,552 --> 01:43:45,776
I stole the file too.

1790
01:43:48,738 --> 01:43:51,039
And I'm going to finish you tomorrow.

1791
01:43:51,222 --> 01:43:53,099
This is my plan.

1792
01:43:54,986 --> 01:43:56,907
What is your enmity with me?

1793
01:43:56,987 --> 01:44:01,692
You will find out.
You will find out before you die.

1794
01:44:25,564 --> 01:44:29,769
'So, there is no spirit.
What he told me is a lie.'

1795
01:44:37,058 --> 01:44:38,425
Welcome.

1796
01:44:38,505 --> 01:44:40,270
Just a little.
- You came at the right time.

1797
01:44:40,350 --> 01:44:41,908
Gautham, he is my best friend.
- Hello, sir.

1798
01:44:41,988 --> 01:44:43,101
Without knowing that,
you went to him..

1799
01:44:43,181 --> 01:44:44,957
..to get your eyes removed.

1800
01:44:45,130 --> 01:44:48,270
'He knows everything.
You and I are fools.'

1801
01:44:48,350 --> 01:44:50,581
Thanks, uncle.
I gained my love because of you.

1802
01:44:50,960 --> 01:44:51,861
I'm glad.

1803
01:44:51,941 --> 01:44:53,944
I don't know how I
can ever repay you, sir.

1804
01:44:54,024 --> 01:44:55,919
It is good that you don't know.

1805
01:44:56,212 --> 01:44:57,351
What's wrong?

1806
01:44:57,590 --> 01:44:58,512
Nothing.

1807
01:44:58,592 --> 01:45:00,715
No, don't sit there.

1808
01:45:00,795 --> 01:45:03,536
Why?
- Mr. Kulakarni is sitting there.

1809
01:45:05,066 --> 01:45:07,214
Yes, sir. He is sitting there.

1810
01:45:08,370 --> 01:45:11,105
He is not sitting in that chair, is he?
- No, sir.

1811
01:45:11,832 --> 01:45:13,275
Come, brother. Sit here.

1812
01:45:19,168 --> 01:45:20,361
Whose plate is this?

1813
01:45:21,544 --> 01:45:22,900
Kulakarni brother's plate.

1814
01:45:24,224 --> 01:45:27,869
I never thought you will
take my words so seriously.

1815
01:45:27,949 --> 01:45:31,292
What are you saying, sir?
He is your childhood friend.

1816
01:45:31,372 --> 01:45:32,637
Your words are a law to him.

1817
01:45:32,844 --> 01:45:34,580
'Is that why you used me?'

1818
01:45:34,660 --> 01:45:35,849
This has been possible
only because of you, sir.

1819
01:45:35,929 --> 01:45:38,008
I couldn't have achieved
it without your support.

1820
01:45:38,088 --> 01:45:41,764
Hey, I didn't support
any of your deeds.

1821
01:45:41,844 --> 01:45:44,734
Are you plotting to frame
me for the murders you do?

1822
01:45:45,290 --> 01:45:48,301
Why are you so frustrated?
He is talking about his love.

1823
01:45:48,381 --> 01:45:53,766
Yeah, right. I know what he's saying.

1824
01:45:56,818 --> 01:46:00,642
Son, ask Mr. Kulakarni
if he wants yogurt.

1825
01:46:03,545 --> 01:46:04,386
Okay.

1826
01:46:04,466 --> 01:46:06,195
He is still enjoying his lentil soup
so he wants some clarified butter.

1827
01:46:06,275 --> 01:46:07,226
Put some clarified butter.

1828
01:46:07,429 --> 01:46:09,097
Hey, you..

1829
01:46:09,177 --> 01:46:11,349
You ask what you want.

1830
01:46:11,932 --> 01:46:13,614
Okay, sir.

1831
01:46:13,694 --> 01:46:14,983
Eat, son.

1832
01:46:15,377 --> 01:46:17,574
I have a stomach upset.

1833
01:46:18,091 --> 01:46:20,627
'He has the whole family fooled.'

1834
01:46:21,238 --> 01:46:22,743
Son!

1835
01:46:23,218 --> 01:46:27,585
I have to talk to you in private.
Will you come out?

1836
01:46:30,799 --> 01:46:31,916
Yeah, sure.

1837
01:46:33,191 --> 01:46:34,683
What did you want to talk to me, sir?

1838
01:46:34,914 --> 01:46:37,558
Kulakarni, he wants to talk
to me in private. You go down.

1839
01:46:37,816 --> 01:46:40,732
I will kill you if you
continue this drama before me.

1840
01:46:41,017 --> 01:46:44,000
You created a non-existent
spirit and fooled me.

1841
01:46:44,080 --> 01:46:46,796
Who are you? Why did you do all this?

1842
01:46:48,613 --> 01:46:52,967
I didn't do it for myself, sir.
I did it for my friends.

1843
01:47:04,955 --> 01:47:07,694
Only three children will
get eyes during this camp.

1844
01:47:07,925 --> 01:47:09,918
Raju. Kiran. Divya.

1845
01:47:09,998 --> 01:47:13,280
Yeah! My friends will be able to see!

1846
01:47:13,781 --> 01:47:15,856
What are you talking about?
- Yes..

1847
01:47:15,936 --> 01:47:18,677
..if you don't get eyes,
we don't want them too. That's it.

1848
01:47:18,757 --> 01:47:20,142
You don't want them?
- No.

1849
01:47:20,222 --> 01:47:21,769
We want to see the world
if you can see it too.

1850
01:47:21,849 --> 01:47:23,817
Will you spend all your
lives without eyesight?

1851
01:47:23,897 --> 01:47:25,355
Yes, we will.

1852
01:47:25,435 --> 01:47:28,651
I will get new eyes sooner or later.

1853
01:47:28,731 --> 01:47:32,679
And even if I don't get eyes,
you all can take care of me.

1854
01:47:33,072 --> 01:47:35,811
I bind you by oath
to accept those eyes.

1855
01:47:58,770 --> 01:48:00,261
Post!

1856
01:48:00,465 --> 01:48:04,113
Post? Father,
is there a letter from my friends?

1857
01:48:04,193 --> 01:48:05,578
Nothing for you, son.

1858
01:48:05,768 --> 01:48:09,774
'I waited for their letters
and phone calls and became sad.'

1859
01:48:10,018 --> 01:48:11,672
'But one day..'

1860
01:48:12,052 --> 01:48:15,171
Son, you have letters
from your friends.

1861
01:48:16,039 --> 01:48:17,911
Yeah!

1862
01:48:17,991 --> 01:48:22,062
'But after that I didn't get
any letters from them for years.'

1863
01:48:22,618 --> 01:48:25,995
'But I continued waiting for them.'

1864
01:48:29,114 --> 01:48:31,298
Father! Is there any letter for me?

1865
01:48:31,378 --> 01:48:32,600
No, son.

1866
01:48:32,840 --> 01:48:34,698
They left and forgot about you.

1867
01:48:34,778 --> 01:48:37,140
You should forget them too.

1868
01:48:37,220 --> 01:48:39,269
I can't forget them
if I'm here, Father.

1869
01:48:39,349 --> 01:48:41,846
Please send me somewhere far.

1870
01:48:43,772 --> 01:48:47,121
After I got my eyesight
I didn't want to see Nethra or Father.

1871
01:48:47,201 --> 01:48:49,670
I wanted to see my childhood
friends who left me.

1872
01:48:49,750 --> 01:48:51,541
I wanted to hit them for doing so.

1873
01:48:51,772 --> 01:48:53,861
And the only thing
that can lead me to them..

1874
01:48:53,941 --> 01:48:55,502
..was the letters they
wrote me when we were children.

1875
01:49:04,677 --> 01:49:05,857
Where are the postal stamps on them?

1876
01:49:05,937 --> 01:49:07,633
Who wrote these letters?
Did you write them?

1877
01:49:07,850 --> 01:49:11,038
Will you listen to me first?
- I won't. What did you do to my friends?

1878
01:49:11,118 --> 01:49:13,208
I want to see them right now.

1879
01:49:14,600 --> 01:49:16,580
You wanted to see them
as soon as you got eyesight.

1880
01:49:16,770 --> 01:49:19,658
They wanted to see you as
soon as they opened their eyes.

1881
01:49:19,943 --> 01:49:23,496
Gautham will be so
surprised to meet us, right?

1882
01:49:23,576 --> 01:49:26,548
Yes. I want to see Gautham too.

1883
01:49:28,525 --> 01:49:31,387
Hello!
- Father, we are almost there.

1884
01:49:31,467 --> 01:49:34,248
We want to see our
friend Gautham first.

1885
01:49:34,328 --> 01:49:36,690
Don't tell him that we are coming.

1886
01:49:36,770 --> 01:49:38,480
Come soon.

1887
01:49:43,776 --> 01:49:45,335
Uncle, what happened?

1888
01:49:45,864 --> 01:49:48,061
Sir! Sir, get up!

1889
01:49:48,141 --> 01:49:51,099
Take me away. Otherwise they will..

1890
01:49:52,388 --> 01:49:54,409
Uncle!
- Uncle!

1891
01:49:54,626 --> 01:49:56,131
Uncle!

1892
01:50:27,458 --> 01:50:29,031
Who are you?

1893
01:50:31,147 --> 01:50:33,765
No, sir. Don't kill me. Don't kill me.

1894
01:50:37,497 --> 01:50:39,029
Hide.

1895
01:50:41,742 --> 01:50:43,302
Father!
- What happened, dear?

1896
01:50:43,382 --> 01:50:46,503
Somebody is killing people here, Father.
- What?

1897
01:50:48,781 --> 01:50:50,734
Where are you, dear?

1898
01:50:50,965 --> 01:50:53,582
Looks like there is
a temple here, Father.

1899
01:50:58,723 --> 01:51:00,798
Please, sir.
- Please, leave us.

1900
01:51:03,928 --> 01:51:05,912
Sir, please. Don't harm us.
- Please, sir.

1901
01:51:05,992 --> 01:51:10,065
Please don't harm us, sir.
We are from Sharada Devi Blind School.

1902
01:51:10,145 --> 01:51:11,692
We got our eyesight just now.

1903
01:51:11,772 --> 01:51:14,575
We wanted to see our
friend Gautham first.

1904
01:51:14,655 --> 01:51:16,575
So, as soon as you got your eyesight..

1905
01:51:16,655 --> 01:51:18,948
..you saw me killing two men.

1906
01:51:20,281 --> 01:51:22,858
So, you will never
forget this Pantham Babji.

1907
01:51:22,938 --> 01:51:24,740
But we won't tell anyone, sir.

1908
01:51:24,820 --> 01:51:26,808
This is the problem
with being able to see.

1909
01:51:26,888 --> 01:51:31,640
You have to see such things
and report them to others.

1910
01:51:31,894 --> 01:51:33,047
Please, sir. Leave us.
- Am I right, Kashi?

1911
01:51:33,127 --> 01:51:34,876
Yes, boss.
- Kill them.

1912
01:51:34,956 --> 01:51:38,435
Please, sir. Please leave us.
Please, sir. Don't kill us.

1913
01:51:41,140 --> 01:51:42,757
Run!

1914
01:51:45,165 --> 01:51:46,239
Run!

1915
01:51:46,619 --> 01:51:50,406
Hey! Stop!
Hey! Catch them!

1916
01:51:50,486 --> 01:51:52,679
Run! Get away!

1917
01:51:57,105 --> 01:51:59,232
Don't get caught. Run.

1918
01:52:11,542 --> 01:52:15,513
Hello! Father!
They killed Raju and Kiran.

1919
01:52:15,593 --> 01:52:17,596
Killed them? Where are you, dear?

1920
01:52:19,289 --> 01:52:21,361
Divya! Divya!

1921
01:52:29,672 --> 01:52:31,386
Kiran! Kiran!

1922
01:52:40,519 --> 01:52:44,328
Raju! Raju! Raju!

1923
01:52:46,075 --> 01:52:47,844
Divya! Divya!

1924
01:52:50,165 --> 01:52:52,151
Search everywhere.

1925
01:52:58,988 --> 01:53:00,322
Search that side.

1926
01:53:01,136 --> 01:53:02,243
She is not here.

1927
01:53:03,219 --> 01:53:04,380
Come on.

1928
01:53:05,161 --> 01:53:06,637
Let's go.
- Let's go.

1929
01:53:08,698 --> 01:53:10,401
Oh no! Someone is here.

1930
01:53:19,825 --> 01:53:21,485
Divya! Divya!

1931
01:53:21,565 --> 01:53:23,449
Father? Fath..

1932
01:53:38,895 --> 01:53:39,763
Divya..

1933
01:53:39,843 --> 01:53:45,828
She is dead.
I'm sure you understood what happened.

1934
01:53:46,169 --> 01:53:48,426
If you file a complaint
with the police..

1935
01:53:48,506 --> 01:53:52,267
..Pantham Babji will kill
all the kids in your blind school..

1936
01:53:52,347 --> 01:53:54,209
..and you too.

1937
01:54:03,413 --> 01:54:06,212
I knew you will be shattered
if I tell you that they are dead.

1938
01:54:06,701 --> 01:54:08,514
I wanted to erase
them from your mind..

1939
01:54:09,230 --> 01:54:11,281
..that's why I stopped
writing letters to you.

1940
01:54:12,540 --> 01:54:14,091
Gautham!

1941
01:54:43,060 --> 01:54:45,262
They didn't want to
see if I couldn't see.

1942
01:54:45,794 --> 01:54:47,910
They wanted to see me
first after opening their eyes.

1943
01:54:48,170 --> 01:54:50,946
If there is anything left
for me to do for such dear friends..

1944
01:54:51,026 --> 01:54:53,637
..it is to kill Pantham Babji.

1945
01:54:54,732 --> 01:54:58,031
Ever since that day,
I don't fear death or desire life.

1946
01:54:58,111 --> 01:55:02,342
I have only one goal, sir.
He should die. He should die.

1947
01:55:14,522 --> 01:55:17,300
But because of my bad luck,
he got arrested.

1948
01:55:17,380 --> 01:55:18,981
I got to know that
uncle is preparing a file..

1949
01:55:19,061 --> 01:55:20,663
..to keep him in jail forever.

1950
01:55:21,637 --> 01:55:22,982
I can't kill him if he is inside.

1951
01:55:23,062 --> 01:55:25,608
And I have to steal that file
in order to get him out of jail.

1952
01:55:25,688 --> 01:55:26,823
I have to enter that house.

1953
01:55:26,903 --> 01:55:29,134
The only way I can do that is Nethra.

1954
01:55:30,208 --> 01:55:33,298
Nethra is the same girl
that I loved when I was blind.

1955
01:55:34,948 --> 01:55:36,825
I felt that God is on my side.

1956
01:55:38,300 --> 01:55:39,038
But..

1957
01:55:39,118 --> 01:55:41,534
Nethra, will you
introduce me to your dad?

1958
01:55:41,803 --> 01:55:43,344
No, I'm scared of my dad.

1959
01:55:47,749 --> 01:55:49,875
When I was wondering what to do next..

1960
01:55:50,440 --> 01:55:52,306
..I remembered Kulakarni,
the man who gave me his eyes.

1961
01:55:59,774 --> 01:56:02,345
I found out this truth
because you gave me your eyes.

1962
01:56:02,597 --> 01:56:07,208
I need your help to do
justice to that truth, sir.

1963
01:56:17,923 --> 01:56:20,169
Your spirit will be with me from now.

1964
01:56:20,972 --> 01:56:23,077
I'm going to pretend
that it is with me.

1965
01:56:24,917 --> 01:56:29,550
I had to become mad in
order to fool everyone around me.

1966
01:56:30,808 --> 01:56:33,759
Even Pantham Babji thought
Kulakarni is his enemy.

1967
01:56:33,839 --> 01:56:35,246
Name is Kulakarni.

1968
01:56:35,326 --> 01:56:38,047
I was doing everything
and it was my revenge..

1969
01:56:38,127 --> 01:56:39,435
..but I let Kulakarni take the blame.

1970
01:56:39,515 --> 01:56:41,312
I entered into this house
in the name of that spirit.

1971
01:56:41,392 --> 01:56:43,493
I stole the file in
the name of that spirit.

1972
01:56:43,573 --> 01:56:45,674
I killed Kashi in
the name of that spirit.

1973
01:56:46,426 --> 01:56:48,856
How did you know about me?

1974
01:56:48,936 --> 01:56:52,936
My brother. Mother. Grandmother.

1975
01:56:54,748 --> 01:56:56,039
He is my dad.

1976
01:56:56,827 --> 01:56:57,869
Who is he?

1977
01:56:57,949 --> 01:57:01,037
Dr. Ashish uncle.
His word is law to my dad.

1978
01:57:01,395 --> 01:57:03,815
That's when I realized
that if I want them to believe..

1979
01:57:03,895 --> 01:57:07,189
..that the spirit is beside me,
I have to convince you first.

1980
01:57:11,372 --> 01:57:13,184
You are too smart.

1981
01:57:13,264 --> 01:57:16,569
Do you think you can kill
Pantham Babji with this plan?

1982
01:57:16,649 --> 01:57:18,299
Hey, Gautham!
- And..

1983
01:57:18,647 --> 01:57:19,677
Yes, sir.

1984
01:57:19,757 --> 01:57:21,272
He is getting released tomorrow.

1985
01:57:21,663 --> 01:57:23,410
If you want Kulkarni's
soul to rest in peace and..

1986
01:57:23,490 --> 01:57:26,524
..if you want him to leave you alone,
there's only one way.

1987
01:57:26,708 --> 01:57:27,489
What is that, sir?

1988
01:57:27,703 --> 01:57:30,036
Kill Pantham Babji.

1989
01:57:38,873 --> 01:57:40,208
How can I kill him, sir?

1990
01:57:40,288 --> 01:57:41,727
Yes, you have to kill him.

1991
01:57:41,900 --> 01:57:44,656
He is not Gandhi. Kill him.
I will take care of the rest.

1992
01:57:44,736 --> 01:57:45,947
You come with me.

1993
01:57:46,027 --> 01:57:47,358
Sir, I can't do it.
- You are not an ordinary man.

1994
01:57:47,438 --> 01:57:48,790
Sir! Sir!

1995
01:57:55,398 --> 01:57:57,731
He gave special discount to you.
- He was such an idiot.

1996
01:57:57,811 --> 01:58:00,362
Hey! Who are you? What are you doing?

1997
01:58:00,442 --> 01:58:01,903
Nethra! Nethra!

1998
01:58:02,109 --> 01:58:04,778
Since there is no evidence
against him, the court..

1999
01:58:04,858 --> 01:58:08,586
..finds the accused named
Pantham Babji not guilty.

2000
01:58:10,178 --> 01:58:13,477
Hello! - I missed out on entertainment
when I was in jail.

2001
01:58:13,726 --> 01:58:16,091
I found your girl at the correct time.

2002
01:58:16,171 --> 01:58:17,752
Hey! Hey!
- Yes.

2003
01:58:17,832 --> 01:58:20,453
Come to the old factory in Walthare
with that same anger in you.

2004
01:58:36,570 --> 01:58:37,959
I have some bad news for you.

2005
01:58:38,039 --> 01:58:40,119
I'm going to kill Kulakarni.

2006
01:58:40,199 --> 01:58:41,995
You can't.
- Why?

2007
01:58:42,075 --> 01:58:43,712
Because he is already dead.

2008
01:58:44,026 --> 01:58:46,435
Dead?
- You killed him.

2009
01:58:46,515 --> 01:58:47,715
When did I kill him?

2010
01:58:47,795 --> 01:58:51,751
Kashi killed him, but he did
it for Pantham Babji, that's you.

2011
01:58:51,831 --> 01:58:54,235
The names match,
but the situations don't match.

2012
01:58:54,315 --> 01:58:55,808
Shut up, you idiot.

2013
01:58:55,888 --> 01:58:57,382
What are you talking about?

2014
01:58:57,462 --> 01:59:00,702
If Kashi killed Kulakarni,
how can Kulakarni kill Kashi?

2015
01:59:00,782 --> 01:59:03,934
A person dies but
a spirit doesn't die.

2016
01:59:04,184 --> 01:59:05,258
That's why he got him killed.

2017
01:59:05,338 --> 01:59:06,896
A spirit?
- A spirit?

2018
01:59:06,976 --> 01:59:08,111
A spirit?

2019
01:59:09,500 --> 01:59:10,423
Lord Hanuman!

2020
01:59:10,503 --> 01:59:12,517
Boss, my wife made fish curry today.

2021
01:59:12,777 --> 01:59:14,166
Can I go to have lunch?
- Hey!

2022
01:59:14,939 --> 01:59:16,596
Yes, the spirit is
making him do these things.

2023
01:59:16,676 --> 01:59:18,437
There is no spirit, sir.
It is his imagination.

2024
01:59:20,147 --> 01:59:20,989
Who is he?

2025
01:59:21,069 --> 01:59:23,116
Kulkarni's sim card
was on his name, sir.

2026
01:59:23,975 --> 01:59:25,850
Are you Kulkarni's friend?

2027
01:59:25,930 --> 01:59:27,317
No, sir. I'm Gautham's friend.

2028
01:59:27,514 --> 01:59:28,859
What about Kulakarni?

2029
01:59:28,939 --> 01:59:29,831
He is Gautham's friend.

2030
01:59:29,911 --> 01:59:31,359
So you all are friends, right?

2031
01:59:31,439 --> 01:59:34,484
No, sir. I'm a visible friend,
he is an invisible friend.

2032
01:59:34,564 --> 01:59:36,543
What are you talking about?

2033
01:59:41,343 --> 01:59:43,139
I will explain everything
clearly to you.

2034
01:59:43,976 --> 01:59:48,125
This is me. This is you.
This is Kashi. This is Gautham.

2035
01:59:48,205 --> 01:59:49,375
Where is Kulakarni?

2036
01:59:49,540 --> 01:59:51,215
Kulakarni doesn't exist, sir.

2037
01:59:51,295 --> 01:59:53,517
Then why are you showing
me these fingers?

2038
01:59:54,940 --> 01:59:59,193
Tell me why he killed my men.
Or I will kill you.

2039
01:59:59,714 --> 02:00:02,641
Who are you talking about?
Kulakarni or Gautham?

2040
02:00:03,665 --> 02:00:04,967
Kulakarni.

2041
02:00:05,124 --> 02:00:06,287
Kulakarni can't kill, sir.

2042
02:00:06,367 --> 02:00:08,613
The thing is,
Gautham killed Kashi because..

2043
02:00:08,693 --> 02:00:11,546
..Kulakarni asked him
to and blamed it on Kulakarni.

2044
02:00:11,702 --> 02:00:13,273
And you want revenge from
Kulakarni for killing Kashi..

2045
02:00:13,353 --> 02:00:15,582
..but you are chasing
after Gautham, sir.

2046
02:00:15,662 --> 02:00:17,413
What are you talking about?

2047
02:00:19,566 --> 02:00:21,606
You didn't understand?
What I said was..

2048
02:00:21,823 --> 02:00:23,542
You can't bring back Kashi to life.

2049
02:00:23,622 --> 02:00:25,252
You want to kill Kulakarni
but he doesn't exist.

2050
02:00:25,332 --> 02:00:27,770
And Gautham who killed
him won't come to save me.

2051
02:00:27,850 --> 02:00:29,289
Without understanding that..

2052
02:00:29,369 --> 02:00:31,597
..if you keep asking me
about Kulakarni like a fool..

2053
02:00:31,677 --> 02:00:33,030
..where will I bring him from?

2054
02:00:33,110 --> 02:00:34,375
Oh God!

2055
02:00:34,669 --> 02:00:36,335
What are you trying to say?
You just killed my buzz.

2056
02:00:36,415 --> 02:00:37,525
How should I explain it to you?

2057
02:00:37,605 --> 02:00:38,766
This is all just
Gautham's imagination.

2058
02:00:38,846 --> 02:00:40,432
No, it is a spirit.
- No, it is his imagination.

2059
02:00:40,512 --> 02:00:41,587
Spirit.
- Imagination.

2060
02:00:41,667 --> 02:00:43,488
Calm down. What is all this nonsense?

2061
02:00:43,568 --> 02:00:46,691
Why are you both fighting
like cats and dogs?

2062
02:00:46,771 --> 02:00:49,911
If you are telling the truth,
if that Kulkarni is really..

2063
02:00:49,991 --> 02:00:52,008
..a spirit or just imagination,
how could we see him?

2064
02:00:52,088 --> 02:00:53,614
Did you see him? Show me.

2065
02:00:53,694 --> 02:00:55,298
Show him.

2066
02:00:56,053 --> 02:00:58,015
Look at them kissing.

2067
02:00:58,197 --> 02:00:59,438
He is Gautham, you fool.

2068
02:01:00,413 --> 02:01:01,533
Ever since he is able to see,
he is imagining that..

2069
02:01:01,613 --> 02:01:02,887
..he can see a man named Kulakarni..

2070
02:01:02,967 --> 02:01:03,998
..who wants him to kill all of you.

2071
02:01:04,078 --> 02:01:05,231
That is not his imagination,
it is the truth.

2072
02:01:05,311 --> 02:01:06,836
Hey, shut up.

2073
02:01:07,175 --> 02:01:10,083
Does that mean Gautham
couldn't see before?

2074
02:01:10,163 --> 02:01:13,415
No, sir. He grew up in
Sharada Devi Blind School.

2075
02:01:13,495 --> 02:01:14,448
Which school?

2076
02:01:14,528 --> 02:01:15,611
Sharada Devi Blind School.

2077
02:01:17,373 --> 02:01:20,385
We are from Sharada Devi Blind School.

2078
02:01:20,786 --> 02:01:24,284
'I killed his friends 15 years ago.'

2079
02:01:24,518 --> 02:01:28,059
'That's why he targeted
me and made this plan.'

2080
02:01:43,806 --> 02:01:45,213
Gautham!

2081
02:01:46,223 --> 02:01:48,132
He doesn't know anything.
He is innocent.

2082
02:01:49,851 --> 02:01:51,431
How can you hit a girl?

2083
02:01:53,861 --> 02:01:56,560
Hey! Get up. Get up. Get up.

2084
02:01:56,640 --> 02:01:58,791
How dare you kill
my men and target me!

2085
02:02:01,525 --> 02:02:04,200
Before dying, your friends begged me..

2086
02:02:04,280 --> 02:02:07,359
..that they have to see you.
But I didn't show mercy.

2087
02:02:07,439 --> 02:02:09,920
I did a really big mistake
by separating you all.

2088
02:02:10,241 --> 02:02:13,271
I will send you to them now.
They will be happy..

2089
02:02:13,351 --> 02:02:14,737
..and you will be happy.

2090
02:02:18,840 --> 02:02:23,961
You know how I killed
your friend Divya?

2091
02:02:24,204 --> 02:02:28,434
Like this.
Like this. I held her head like this..

2092
02:02:33,631 --> 02:02:37,071
..and twisted her throat
like a hen's throat and killed her.

2093
02:02:49,128 --> 02:02:51,331
Hey! Hey! Hey!

2094
02:03:04,508 --> 02:03:06,450
What is this jumping
around in darkness?

2095
02:03:06,530 --> 02:03:08,121
Maybe he is stronger in darkness..

2096
02:03:08,295 --> 02:03:09,922
..just like a crocodile
is stronger in water.

2097
02:03:43,611 --> 02:03:45,359
I will walk without making noise.

2098
02:03:50,806 --> 02:03:53,681
I recently admitted my
little son in kindergarten.

2099
02:03:53,985 --> 02:03:55,601
Please leave me.
- Call them.

2100
02:03:55,970 --> 02:03:58,682
What?
- Call your men one after the other.

2101
02:03:58,762 --> 02:04:00,191
Okay.

2102
02:04:01,167 --> 02:04:05,429
There is no time, my friend.
Peace or war?

2103
02:04:07,693 --> 02:04:09,277
His time came to an end.

2104
02:04:09,484 --> 02:04:11,936
'Let's do bashing up.'

2105
02:04:14,556 --> 02:04:16,835
He bashed him up.

2106
02:04:18,896 --> 02:04:19,955
'Tell me, boys!'

2107
02:04:20,035 --> 02:04:21,988
'What to do, what not to do?'
- This phone will be my death.

2108
02:04:23,318 --> 02:04:24,918
Hey!

2109
02:04:25,732 --> 02:04:27,733
Hey! Hey! Where are you?

2110
02:04:27,813 --> 02:04:29,371
Hey!

2111
02:04:31,867 --> 02:04:34,403
Hey!

2112
02:04:35,528 --> 02:04:36,735
I will kill you!

2113
02:04:39,290 --> 02:04:41,378
Hey! Show yourself!

2114
02:04:43,169 --> 02:04:44,728
Hey!

2115
02:04:50,587 --> 02:04:52,855
Did my friends plead
you in the same way?

2116
02:04:56,422 --> 02:04:59,202
No.
- We were born in darkness..

2117
02:04:59,392 --> 02:05:02,661
..we ate in darkness
and we walked in darkness.

2118
02:05:03,023 --> 02:05:06,662
We lived with the hope
that we'll see the world one day.

2119
02:05:10,365 --> 02:05:13,810
If we had known that
there are monsters like you..

2120
02:05:14,094 --> 02:05:15,993
..in this world,
we wouldn't have wished for eyes.

2121
02:05:16,073 --> 02:05:18,661
We would've wanted
to stay in that darkness.

2122
02:05:22,865 --> 02:05:25,808
They wanted to see me first
when they got their eyesight.

2123
02:05:26,723 --> 02:05:28,300
So you saw how much they loved me.

2124
02:05:28,380 --> 02:05:31,402
Now you have to see
how much I love them.

2125
02:05:31,724 --> 02:05:33,674
No, don't shoot.

2126
02:05:33,754 --> 02:05:35,403
Don't kill me.

2127
02:05:37,870 --> 02:05:39,972
No matter what you say,
I can't do it, Kulakarni.

2128
02:05:40,052 --> 02:05:42,718
I can't kill him.
- Who are you talking to?

2129
02:05:45,278 --> 02:05:47,414
No, sir.
Please, sir. I can't kill him.

2130
02:05:47,652 --> 02:05:49,737
Listen to me. Do as Kulakarni said.

2131
02:05:49,817 --> 02:05:51,873
No, sir. No, sir.
- I will take care of the rest.

2132
02:05:51,953 --> 02:05:52,941
I can't do it, sir.
- Hey, crazy man!

2133
02:05:53,021 --> 02:05:54,399
What are you saying to him?
- Shoot him.

2134
02:05:54,479 --> 02:05:57,007
I can't do it, sir.
- Hey!

2135
02:06:14,619 --> 02:06:17,535
Finally you turned me into a murderer.
Are you happy?

2136
02:06:19,061 --> 02:06:21,214
Sir, arrest me. Please, sir.

2137
02:06:21,398 --> 02:06:23,096
No. This is not your fault.

2138
02:06:23,333 --> 02:06:25,520
Tell me where is Kulkarni's spirit.

2139
02:06:26,608 --> 02:06:28,253
Where?

2140
02:06:29,084 --> 02:06:31,186
'He is a bigger fool than me.'

2141
02:06:33,237 --> 02:06:37,018
Hey, Kulakarni!
Your work is done, right? Now go. Go.

2142
02:06:40,425 --> 02:06:43,239
Don't torture my son in law. Go.

2143
02:06:43,319 --> 02:06:46,275
Will you go or not?
Shoot.. Do you want me to shoot?

2144
02:06:46,355 --> 02:06:48,089
Sir! Sir, Kulakarni is
leaving after your warning.

2145
02:06:48,169 --> 02:06:50,056
'He started it again.'
- He is leaving.

2146
02:06:50,276 --> 02:06:51,938
Sir, he is thanking
us for helping him.

2147
02:06:52,018 --> 02:06:53,718
Sir, he is saying bye to us.
- Say bye to him.

2148
02:06:53,798 --> 02:06:55,718
Bye.
- Bye. - Fools!

2149
02:06:55,798 --> 02:06:57,837
Sir, there is no spirit.
Who are you waving to?

2150
02:06:57,917 --> 02:07:00,053
How can you say that when
we can see him? See there!

2151
02:07:00,133 --> 02:07:03,189
There! Say bye! Wave your hand.
- Bye.

2152
02:07:03,269 --> 02:07:04,257
Bye.

2153
02:07:04,511 --> 02:07:06,868
Gautham, come here.
- Bye.

2154
02:07:06,948 --> 02:07:08,834
I've seen men who leave their
parents after getting wives..

2155
02:07:08,914 --> 02:07:10,733
..and men who leave friends
after getting lovers.

2156
02:07:10,813 --> 02:07:14,175
But you did all this for
your dead friends. I like you.

2157
02:07:37,050 --> 02:07:39,102
I can see the spirit that I created?

2158
02:07:39,182 --> 02:07:41,984
Imagination.
It's all in my imagination.

2159
02:07:42,064 --> 02:07:43,781
Are you done with your jokes?

2160
02:07:43,861 --> 02:07:45,205
I will slap you!

2161
02:07:45,285 --> 02:07:47,460
So you are a spi..

2162
02:07:47,540 --> 02:07:49,426
I'm a spirit.

2163
02:07:50,270 --> 02:07:55,102
The same spirit that
you used like a credit card.

2164
02:07:55,322 --> 02:08:00,662
I broke the new tiles
on my grave and came here..

2165
02:08:00,900 --> 02:08:02,721
..because I couldn't bear
to see your crimes.

2166
02:08:02,801 --> 02:08:03,748
What did I do, sir?

2167
02:08:03,930 --> 02:08:07,912
What did you do? You have my eyes.

2168
02:08:08,100 --> 02:08:10,053
You committed murders on my name..

2169
02:08:10,133 --> 02:08:13,210
..and fooled the policemen.
You will pay for it.

2170
02:08:13,290 --> 02:08:15,771
I used my brain, sir.
I didn't use you.

2171
02:08:15,851 --> 02:08:17,865
This is the first time
that I'm seeing your spirit.

2172
02:08:18,085 --> 02:08:23,272
So you think you killed
Babji without my help?

2173
02:08:23,352 --> 02:08:25,442
Go back two reels.

2174
02:08:29,906 --> 02:08:32,478
If I hadn't saved you like that,
you would've been sleeping..

2175
02:08:32,558 --> 02:08:36,167
..in a grave beside me
instead of sleeping on this bed.

2176
02:08:36,247 --> 02:08:38,141
Is that so? Thank you, sir.

2177
02:08:38,221 --> 02:08:40,532
Keep that to yourself.

2178
02:08:40,612 --> 02:08:42,604
I'm saying that I can't
repay you in this life.

2179
02:08:42,684 --> 02:08:45,349
No. You have to repay
me in this very life.

2180
02:08:45,523 --> 02:08:46,336
How?

2181
02:08:46,416 --> 02:08:50,481
I didn't die of a heart
attack as everyone thinks.

2182
02:08:50,561 --> 02:08:52,113
It was a pre-planned murder.

2183
02:08:52,373 --> 02:08:53,741
Murder?
- Yes.

2184
02:08:54,511 --> 02:08:58,124
They deceived me in a
business deal and killed me.

2185
02:08:58,308 --> 02:09:03,032
He is a big don in Dubai,
his name is Jaffar Khan.

2186
02:09:03,357 --> 02:09:04,735
So?

2187
02:09:04,815 --> 02:09:06,178
You have to murder him.

2188
02:09:06,721 --> 02:09:08,728
Another murder?

2189
02:09:10,431 --> 02:09:13,509
Looks like you are in a good mood.
Very stiff.

2190
02:09:13,683 --> 02:09:16,862
'Not stiff.
I gave him such a big shock..'

2191
02:09:17,112 --> 02:09:19,976
'..that he can't consummate
his marriage for a year.'

2192
02:09:29,393 --> 02:09:32,668
"Handsome is here to play.
He is here to hunt at dusk."

2193
02:09:32,748 --> 02:09:34,377
"He sprayed perfume from Gulf."

2194
02:09:34,457 --> 02:09:36,333
"He has jasmines wrapped
around his wrists."

2195
02:09:36,413 --> 02:09:39,501
"Handsome is here to play.
He is here to hunt at dusk."

2196
02:09:39,581 --> 02:09:41,317
"He sprayed perfume from Gulf."

2197
02:09:41,397 --> 02:09:41,397
"He has jasmines wrapped
around his wrists."
