1
00:01:38,083 --> 00:01:39,208
Good morning sir.

2
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,458
(Moans)

3
00:01:53,541 --> 00:01:54,208
Hey

4
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,916
(Moaning continues)

5
00:01:58,791 --> 00:01:59,333
(Gunshot)

6
00:01:59,416 --> 00:02:00,708
(Screams of pain)

7
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:07,125
(Blood splashes)

8
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,625
Hey what happened? Where is Sivan?

9
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:15,500
I just saw him here.

10
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:17,791
He was shot by someone.

11
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:19,458
He was wearing white clothes.

12
00:02:19,708 --> 00:02:21,208
There was blood all over his clothes.

13
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:23,041
Ok. Where is the body?

14
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:25,875
Movie is still playing inside.

15
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:27,166
You must have misconceived
something from the sound of the movie.

16
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,458
The main reason why you shouldn't
drink while watching a movie.

17
00:02:29,708 --> 00:02:32,041
You can come and check sir.
I witnessed the body.

18
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:35,166
Are you bluffing? Murdered or died?
Be clear in what you say.

19
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:35,875
Where is the blood?

20
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:37,333
The body was here sir.

21
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:38,791
As soon as he opened
the door someone shot him sir.

22
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:40,375
Was he Actor Surya or Actor Vijayakanth
(Famous Tamil Action Heroes).

23
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:41,750
Do we look insane to you?

24
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:45,083
Movie is over. Move away. Open the door.

25
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:53,541
Security.
Someone has died inside the theatre.

26
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:54,625
Ha where?

27
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:55,625
Come, I'll show you.

28
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,291
There is nothing here.

29
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:04,458
No. He was lying dead in this seat.

30
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:05,958
Alright. Where is the dead body?
Where is the blood?

31
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:09,916
I guess you have watched a murder
film and panicked. Come let's go.

32
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,250
I am uttering the truth.

33
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:12,458
Alright. Ok.

34
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,791
Two days before, another guy
just like you watched this movie..

35
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:17,250
..and told me someone
is lying dead in the bathroom.

36
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,541
I checked none was found. Just go.

37
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:12,291
'Dear god everything will be alright.'

38
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:14,458
'My name is Deepak.'

39
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:17,208
'There was a time when
my theatre was celebrated.'

40
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:21,000
(Crowd cheering)

41
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:27,875
(Movie sounds)

42
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:30,666
(Crowd cheering)

43
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:34,708
'But my father was addicted to gambling..'

44
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:36,583
'..and never sustained
the quality of the theatre.'

45
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,333
'He stopped buying new
films to play in the theatre.'

46
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:44,500
'From that day both our family
and theatre plunged down into deep well.'

47
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:55,000
'So my father was
depressed and also died.'

48
00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:01,583
'From that moment, there will
always be some muddle in our theatre.'

49
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:04,708
'Save me. Save me.'

50
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:06,333
'Everyday people who watch movies here..'

51
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:08,291
'..would always fall
into some complications.'

52
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:09,666
'Open the gate!'

53
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:16,541
'Few people said there
were wraiths in this place.'

54
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,541
'Ultimately this became
our living home too.'

55
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:20,833
'She is my sister Mahima.'

56
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:22,375
Hey, you're late to school. Get up.

57
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:23,166
'He is my son Chintu.'

58
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,250
I'll sleep for 2 more minutes
please Mahima.

59
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:26,416
'And Cauvery my wife.'
- He is not getting up. Ask him.

60
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:28,833
You two have started it again.

61
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:32,208
Chintu wake up.
Your aunt is yelling at you.

62
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:34,250
I'll sleep for 2 more minutes mom.

63
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:36,666
Mmm. Give him 2 minutes.
You sleep darling.

64
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:37,916
(Mahima) Brother...

65
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:42,875
'His name is Narayanan.'

66
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:44,583
'He works here from my father's time.'

67
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:46,416
'He is an honest man.'

68
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:49,041
'After my father's demise..'

69
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:54,125
'..to settle his pending
debts we are playing lewd movies.'

70
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:59,291
'Also I know cinema completely,
that is the only way I could live.'

71
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:04,416
'This is my factory,
my business and everything.'

72
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:08,333
'Though my family never wanted to partake,
they still engaged in it for me.'

73
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:24,750
Stop! This is the place.

74
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:27,958
This is the theater where they are seeing.
- This is the theater? - Yes.

75
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:30,833
I will show him an action movie
in this theater, let's go.

76
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:32,958
Come, sister! I am a small boy?

77
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:34,666
He will there inside for sure.

78
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:38,125
He doesn't let me watch the movie,
today he's finished!

79
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:39,625
He sits inside after taking
a ticket for Rs 10.

80
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:42,208
Hey man, today I won't spare you.

81
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:45,375
I know that you are here. Will you
come to me without fuss or not?

82
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:46,541
You are watching a movie?

83
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:47,916
I will show you a real movie.

84
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,375
Play the sound.
- Okay.

85
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,458
Take him on, sister.

86
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:55,291
(Song playing in theatre)

87
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:04,625
Alas, everyone is touching her waist!

88
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,833
In a short while
even the others may join.

89
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:11,291
I should go there before that.

90
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:12,916
Wait, I am coming!

91
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:16,375
This is a sin! I pray to you.

92
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:18,958
Hey, you are not able to
do anything at home.

93
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:21,000
But you watch the movie here
and wasting the sweat.

94
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:23,541
Yes, sister. He's wasting all his
energy here and so became like this.

95
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:26,458
I will watch only your movie at home
and never see such films again.

96
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:27,625
Let's go home.
- Okay.

97
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:30,875
Let's go. - Madam, will you please
give your phone number?

98
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:33,250
You want phone number?!
Come, my dear.

99
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:47,916
Is he in police uniform?

100
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,000
Hope he's not the SI from my factory area.

101
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:54,375
(Phone rings)

102
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:55,833
Tell me sir?

103
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:56,958
Cut all the obscene shots in this show.

104
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:59,250
Sir, it's the weekend we
will get more people for this show.

105
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,208
Narayana, I can a smell a crow.

106
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:04,625
A crow must have died near
the ticket counter.

107
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:06,041
I will come later and clean it up.

108
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:08,166
No, just listen to me..

109
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,625
..I guess there is a cop in this show,
so don't play any obscene shots.

110
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:11,916
We will show it in the next show.

111
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:12,875
Ok sir.

112
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:28,375
Hello, will there be
pornographic scenes in this film?

113
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:29,208
Yes sir.

114
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:30,166
Ok then let's watch it.

115
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:35,958
The movie ended soon.

116
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:39,583
Why has he come again?

117
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:48,250
Narayanan, don't play any
pornographic scenes in this show too.

118
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:49,666
What happened now?

119
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:51,916
The crow is doing rounds near our theater.

120
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:52,833
(Laughs)

121
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:56,750
Would a crow come to see the clip
in the theater? What even if it sees?

122
00:08:57,333 --> 00:09:00,083
Narayana, I told you that police
are referred to as crows.

123
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:02,666
Instead of speaking in code language..

124
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,791
..why don't you say directly
that police are here?

125
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:06,458
This doesn't look good.

126
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,791
This seat would do.

127
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,083
Sir, will they play porn?

128
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:18,458
I am also eager to watch the same.
- Okay, okay.

129
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:20,541
(Movie playing)

130
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:29,708
Hello, who is the owner of the theatre?

131
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:30,666
It's me sir.

132
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,041
Usually you will play lewd
scenes during weekends right?

133
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:33,000
Why didn't you play it today?

134
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:34,500
We don't play all those
scenes in our theatre sir.

135
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:35,916
I'm not so stupid to believe this.

136
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:38,416
I came here getting the tip. Understand?

137
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:40,333
Why didn't you play porn scenes?

138
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:41,541
If we play those scenes,
we'll get caught sir.

139
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:42,541
Only if they see, can they catch.

140
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:43,500
What to catch sir?

141
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,500
Ahh I meant the chair.
I'm a harsh officer.

142
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:47,208
I won't move from this
place until I see some porn.

143
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:48,375
Are you going to show me or not?

144
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:49,833
How would it help
if the fence ate up the crop?

145
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,541
What do you mean by saying
fence and crop?

146
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,583
Being a cop it's immoral
of you to ask for porn sir.

147
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:56,416
Cop? Who is the cop here?

148
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:57,458
You aren't the police?

149
00:09:57,708 --> 00:09:59,625
I wanted to become
a police officer but couldn't.

150
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:01,000
I'm from the electrical department.

151
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:03,166
I am Line-man Venkatasamy.

152
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,791
Now if you don't play the porn scenes,
I'll cut it.

153
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:06,708
What will you cut sir?

154
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:08,333
Why aren't you realising
the point old rag?

155
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:09,250
I'm the one who plays the porn scenes sir.

156
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:11,583
Ohh it's you.
Please, I beg you to play the porn scenes.

157
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:14,041
I saw it in the poster,
and I want to watch it as a movie.

158
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:17,000
Please help me, I'll be happy sir.

159
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:18,666
Sir please come with me.

160
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:20,166
Are you going to play it?

161
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:20,916
Yes sir.

162
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,125
Whoever is going to play it,
I want to see it.

163
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:25,250
You're so sweet sir.
I want to see...

164
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,750
Don't know what clip they will show.
- (Door closes)

165
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:30,833
(Moans of pain)

166
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:36,000
Alas, my back is broken.

167
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:43,083
I have been working here since 15 yes.

168
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:45,375
Eureka!

169
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:47,833
Instead of showing respect
after taking a loan..

170
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:49,916
For the sin I committed
in taking a loan from you..

171
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,208
I am not able to go outside with dignity.

172
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:55,958
Your men come every day to our
home and give a lot of trouble.

173
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:58,708
You are threatening a lot.
We also can do the same.

174
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:01,583
I will make a police complaint against
you that you tried to rape my wife.

175
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:02,916
(Laughs)

176
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:05,958
Show his performance
when he came to ask for money.

177
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:09,083
'I will mortgage everything and
repay the loan. Please lend me, bro'.

178
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,833
Now the performance has changed.
Don't be tense.

179
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:13,833
Let's play a game for fun.
- A game?

180
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:15,750
A guest of mine will come to your home.

181
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:18,041
You should keep him
in your house for a week.

182
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:20,208
If you do that, you win.

183
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:22,500
You need not repay me any money.

184
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:26,208
But if you send him away before a week,
I am the winner.

185
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:28,000
And then you have to pay me
the entire amount.

186
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:31,000
Why just one week,
I will keep him for a full month.

187
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:32,875
You will not face any problem
because of him.

188
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:35,958
He doesn't eat or drink
or even go to the bathroom.

189
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:38,166
He keeps sleeping all the time.

190
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:41,333
Because he is dead!

191
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,416
Salute the boss.

192
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,708
May you live long, daughter.

193
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:55,958
You won the game,
I am repaying you the money.

194
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:57,250
Please get the body removed.

195
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:59,708
You just showed a dead body
and recovered the money.

196
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:01,416
You will perform the last rites
for the body.

197
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:03,333
Your villainism seems to be a new type.

198
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:05,250
(Laughs)

199
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,791
That is boss' style!

200
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:10,000
All this is fine, brother-in-law.

201
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:12,875
The theatre owner took money
and not returning.

202
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:14,416
But you don't take any action against him.

203
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:15,791
(Laughs)

204
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:19,708
The guesthouse,
our home and these cars.

205
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:23,583
Our jewellery all that
we got because of his father.

206
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:26,625
Is that so?
- I am thinking with sentiment.

207
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,083
Mom please feed me first.

208
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:33,291
Eat quickly, finish the homework
and sleep early.

209
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:34,791
(To Deepak) This is for you.

210
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,375
Brother..

211
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:37,250
Hmm.

212
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:39,166
Nothing much.

213
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,250
Hey, tell me what it is.

214
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:45,333
Brother..
My school has arranged for a tour.

215
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:46,208
Ok.

216
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:47,916
I was also planning to go too.

217
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,875
No dad, nobody else
in school is going for it.

218
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:52,625
Hey, you please shut yourself.

219
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:54,083
Why are you smacking him?

220
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:58,416
My friends are going too.
So I planned for it.

221
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,625
How much money do you need for it?

222
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:00,750
Rs.10,000.

223
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:02,458
Do you think your brother is a king?

224
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:05,583
He has a thousand horses and
you think you can ride them for your tour?

225
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:07,541
She is just a small girl. Please be calm.

226
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:09,833
We should have some wealth to give too.

227
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:12,083
You need to understand our
financial circumstances Mahima.

228
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,583
You needn't go anywhere.

229
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:15,458
Just concentrate on your education.

230
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:43,416
Nine, Ten, Eleven, Twelve...

231
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,291
Greetings sir.

232
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:47,250
Hey Cheenu. Your mom was unhealthy right?
What happened?

233
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:48,083
Hello sister.

234
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:49,083
Is she alright?
- Hello Cheenu.

235
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:51,375
She is back from the hospital.
She looks fine.

236
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:55,041
You don't look like a samosa seller.

237
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:56,666
You like a college-goer.
- (Laughs)

238
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:59,416
We cannot be dirty for our job sir.

239
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,625
Don't joke around brother.

240
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:01,750
If you want to work in a theatre.

241
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:03,291
You need to be fashion
finesse to a little level.

242
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:05,000
Hey.
- If you give me my salary on time..

243
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:05,958
..I can buy more outfits.

244
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:08,750
I know you will bring up wage issues
as soon as I ask you about your fashion.

245
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:11,208
I'll give it to you in five days time.
Don't worry.

246
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:11,875
Alright brother.

247
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:15,875
Ok, take these and put them in my room.

248
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:17,041
Can someone accompany
me to count these bottles?

249
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:17,958
Mahima..
- Ha.

250
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:20,541
..you go with Cheenu
and count those bottles.

251
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:21,458
Go soon.
- Ok sister.

252
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:22,833
I don't like your outfit.

253
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:25,791
Hey where is your shirt?

254
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:28,083
You said you didn't like it,
so I removed it.

255
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:29,583
How about your pants?

256
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:30,666
You don't like that either.
Wait, I'll remove it.

257
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:33,125
Hey it's ok. Don't do it.
It looks good.

258
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:34,333
Thank god. I'm saved.

259
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:36,125
Keep it there.
- Haa no I'll keep it here.

260
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,083
There's space there. Just do what I say.

261
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:38,291
No, I'll keep it here.
- I asked you to keep it there right?

262
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:39,166
No way.. I'll keep it right there.

263
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:39,708
(Glass bottle breaks)

264
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:40,500
Won't you listen to me?

265
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:42,208
It happened because of you.
- No it was you.

266
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:43,750
It was definitely you.
- No you.

267
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:46,458
Ok, We can decide who broke
it in the spin-the-bottle game.

268
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:50,375
If this bottle spins & points at me,
you broke the bottle.

269
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:51,833
You should do what I say!

270
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:54,583
If this bottle spins to me,
you should do what I tell you.

271
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:55,916
Deal?
- Deal.

272
00:14:57,708 --> 00:14:59,416
It won't point at you.
It will be my direction, just see.

273
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,250
Let's see that too.

274
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:04,666
Yes..
See, I won the game.

275
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:05,583
It's the bottle's mistake.

276
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:06,708
(Giggles)

277
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:09,166
I have a long time desire.
Will you do it for me?

278
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:10,166
What is that?

279
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,666
You should never tell it to anyone.

280
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:12,500
I won't.

281
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,166
Promise?
- Promise.

282
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,208
Do you smoke?

283
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:17,291
No I won't.

284
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:19,541
It's a shame that you're
a man and you don't smoke.

285
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:20,250
Haa.. (Shocks)

286
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:20,958
(Giggles)

287
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:21,916
Why are you shaming me like this?

288
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,041
I want to know what is so
special about cigarettes, Cheenu.

289
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:27,583
What's so special? Haa..

290
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:28,750
Will you bring me a cigarette?

291
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:29,750
Are you even a girl?

292
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:31,625
You promised me to do anything,
if you lose that game.

293
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:33,291
Go. Buy me a cigarette and come.

294
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:34,666
(Giggles)

295
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,166
Did you buy it? Nobody saw you right?

296
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,250
Shopkeeper saw me.

297
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:49,458
(Coughs)

298
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:54,208
Why does it infuriate?
How do men smoke these?

299
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,458
Wait, I'll try it for myself and see.

300
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:00,916
Hey Cheenu, why are you taking it?
You have no habit too.

301
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:05,708
If you renovate this theatre and build an
apartment you can make huge profits sir.

302
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:07,541
This Deepak doesn't get the idea of it.

303
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:11,500
My dear god. You're my saviour.

304
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:13,791
Why has Raj come here?
Is there any problem?

305
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:16,875
Greetings sir.

306
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:17,791
You will be good, Deepak.

307
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:21,291
You just cross your legs stylishly.
Your photo will look stylish sir.

308
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:22,333
Greetings sir.

309
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:24,958
Greetings madam.
How are the theatre profits?

310
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:27,875
Profits are not left for me because
I spend it on maintaining the theatre..

311
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:31,041
..my family and also
to pay your interests sir.

312
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:33,458
I was going this way.
You jogged my memory.

313
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:36,666
Hence I landed here
to see you and your family.

314
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:37,750
Bring quickly.
- I will bring.

315
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:40,291
Get one glass without salt.

316
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,041
Okay.
- Why?

317
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,083
Did you forget it, brother in law?
What did my sister say?

318
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:44,625
She said that I should
take good care of you.

319
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:46,416
If you take more salt, you BP will rise.

320
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,958
Tell that to everyone.

321
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:50,125
Tell everyone that I have BP and sugar.

322
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:51,833
Please take this.

323
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:54,625
I don't want.

324
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:56,375
For you?
- Enough, stop drinking.

325
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:58,666
If you drink more, you will catch cold.
Didn't sister say that?

326
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:00,458
Thanks.

327
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:04,500
I'll take leave.

328
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:06,958
You forgot to speak something.

329
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:09,708
Haa. Deepak, he is my son-in-law.

330
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:11,291
He came back from America.
- Hi.

331
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:13,791
He and his friends are staying
here for 4 days. Please help them.

332
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:14,875
I can help sir.

333
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:17,833
There is no safety for
their vehicles in my place.

334
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:21,375
So they feel it will
be comfortable in your place.

335
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:23,041
But we will keep here only if you wish.

336
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,208
Why are you asking me all these sir?
You can keep them.

337
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:27,625
(Laughs) I already told you.
Deepak is our friend.

338
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:28,458
Thank you brother.

339
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:51,958
Cheenu, did you see that liplock scene?
- Ha

340
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:53,333
Shall we try it?
- Haa..

341
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,500
Close your eyes first.

342
00:17:57,916 --> 00:18:01,250
No, don't close your eyes. Open them.

343
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:01,916
Ok.

344
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:03,791
Okay.

345
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:08,166
Cheenu, did you brush your teeth?

346
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:11,416
Hey, please don't spoil my moment.

347
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:12,666
Let's try it now.

348
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:20,625
Cheenu, I didn't brush my teeth.
Shall we try kissing later?

349
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:21,250
(Frowns)

350
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,666
Bye.

351
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:51,000
You don't have to hit them
to the wall to kill them.

352
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:52,791
Just the stink of
the toilet can kill them.

353
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:54,833
The movie bits in the theater are superb.

354
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:57,333
Hey come here. Come here I said.

355
00:18:57,958 --> 00:18:58,541
Yes tell me brother.

356
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:01,250
Call the guy from that ticket counter.

357
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:02,041
Ok, brother.

358
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:02,958
Just go.

359
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,708
Give me three Rs. 20 ticket.

360
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:05,625
Brother, Sir is calling you.

361
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:06,375
Who?

362
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:07,541
Raj sir's son-in-law.

363
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:09,083
Give me three Rs. 20 ticket

364
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:09,750
Sir.. sir.. Sir..

365
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:11,208
I'll be right back.
- Give me a ticket.

366
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:15,166
Finally, you have arrived..
I'm in alcohol aftereffect. Get me a soda.

367
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:17,458
There is a huge crowd outside the counter.
They will be waiting for me.

368
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:18,250
Public?

369
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:20,750
(Laughs)

370
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:22,875
Is it Bahubali-2?
(Famous Indian blockbuster movie).

371
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:24,583
The counter is too crowded?

372
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:27,000
You're playing an adult movie.

373
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,958
Is this even a theatre?
And you're the owner?

374
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:34,083
Don't create too much hype.
Get me a soda.

375
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:35,041
Ok sir.

376
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:38,958
I told you right?
We can do whatever we want here.

377
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,083
Sir, sir...

378
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:47,291
You came so early?
Hey stop right there.

379
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:51,041
(Whooshing sound)

380
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:53,333
Do you want some?

381
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:55,708
This is very costly.

382
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:58,666
(Laughs)

383
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:05,500
Soda was really tasty.

384
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:12,208
Sir, please come here.

385
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:14,625
(Arrives anxiously)

386
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:15,291
Ha..

387
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:17,125
Narayanan, What happened?
Why is he like that?

388
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:19,291
It smells so bad.

389
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:20,958
What? Is he dead?

390
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,250
No sir. I'm speaking about
that bathroom's bad smell.

391
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:24,916
We are in the bathroom.
It has a foul smell.

392
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:26,250
First check whether he is alive.

393
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,666
(Nods) He has no breath.

394
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:35,250
(Shocks) Oh. Shit. Let's call the police.

395
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:36,750
(Weeps)

396
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:39,208
Why are you impelling
to call the police sir?

397
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:42,083
Hey, he is dead. What else should we do?
Just wait, Cauvery.

398
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:43,750
I'm frightened.
- He is not alive?

399
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:44,666
I said wait.

400
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:47,916
If cops come here, they will
close our theatre and seal it sir.

401
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:51,291
Moreover he is Nagu, a local thug.
I'll take care of this sir.

402
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:53,791
That is also true.
If cops arrive we'll be in trouble.

403
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,666
Then what shall we do?

404
00:20:57,041 --> 00:21:02,125
Nagu, you have molested
3 women and killed 5 people.

405
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:06,291
I was expecting your death.
That dream has come true now.

406
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:10,375
You should be inside this burial ground,
that will do good for all.

407
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:20,416
Seems like he is catching my leg?

408
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:22,666
Does he want me to burn him?

409
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:29,083
Alright he wants me to bury him.

410
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:35,041
I saw Narayanan with an uncertain
look coming out of the bathroom.

411
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:45,583
There's a chance that Narayanan
might have killed him.

412
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,083
I guess I should keep an eye on him.

413
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:03,791
(Wakes up shocks)

414
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:04,625
What happened?

415
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,041
I've been having a nightmare
of that dead body for the past 2 days.

416
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,041
Two days..?

417
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,958
I've been having this nightmare
for the past two days.

418
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:34,583
Hello, what do you want?

419
00:22:35,125 --> 00:22:36,125
Sorry sir.

420
00:22:51,791 --> 00:22:53,541
Daily I'm delayed
to school because of you.

421
00:22:53,625 --> 00:22:54,791
You're not listening to me.

422
00:23:30,125 --> 00:23:31,750
(Bell rings)

423
00:23:32,208 --> 00:23:33,916
(Crowd murmurs)

424
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:40,375
Come and take it boys.

425
00:23:40,666 --> 00:23:43,791
This brand will be really tasty. Enjoy.

426
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:45,125
Cheers bro.

427
00:23:45,208 --> 00:23:46,208
Cheers brother.

428
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:47,208
Cheers.

429
00:23:47,291 --> 00:23:49,333
Where is the starter for this drink?

430
00:23:49,541 --> 00:23:52,416
Ohh shit. Oh.

431
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,208
Hey you, come here. (Whistles)

432
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:03,666
Now we will get something to eat.
Just wait and see.

433
00:24:03,958 --> 00:24:05,000
Awesome brother.

434
00:24:05,083 --> 00:24:05,916
Come soon. (Snaps finger)

435
00:24:08,916 --> 00:24:10,208
Haa.

436
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:11,916
Sir...

437
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:16,791
We need something to
eat along with this drink.

438
00:24:17,375 --> 00:24:20,333
Sir, it's very late now.
All the shops would be closed now sir.

439
00:24:20,708 --> 00:24:21,625
We know that.

440
00:24:22,375 --> 00:24:25,208
Ask your wife to cook something.
(Laughs wickedly)

441
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:30,500
Ask her to make an omelette
with more onion and green chillies.

442
00:24:30,666 --> 00:24:31,625
Just go.
- Ok. sir.

443
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:37,583
No, she is sleeping.

444
00:24:40,083 --> 00:24:41,666
I don't know how to make an omelette.

445
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:47,583
Sir..

446
00:24:48,375 --> 00:24:51,333
Hey guys, omelette has come.
- It has come so early.

447
00:24:51,375 --> 00:24:52,875
Omelette has come. Take it.

448
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:54,708
Here it is. It looks so good.

449
00:24:56,916 --> 00:24:58,291
(Disgusts)

450
00:24:58,375 --> 00:24:59,291
(Spits)

451
00:24:59,375 --> 00:25:00,000
Is it not good sir?

452
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:02,583
Does your wife have no
clue on how to make an omelette?

453
00:25:02,958 --> 00:25:03,875
I made it sir.

454
00:25:04,208 --> 00:25:05,291
It tastes grumpy, none will eat this!

455
00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:09,500
Why are you staring at me?
Will you slap me?

456
00:25:10,166 --> 00:25:13,375
You eat the omelette you made.

457
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:15,583
Today we have made goat delicacy.

458
00:25:15,666 --> 00:25:19,791
Are you kidding me?

459
00:25:19,875 --> 00:25:20,833
Will you drink?
Wait, I'll get you some booze.

460
00:25:20,916 --> 00:25:21,708
You make him drink bro.

461
00:25:22,166 --> 00:25:22,750
(Spits)

462
00:25:22,833 --> 00:25:23,500
Here take a sip.

463
00:25:27,208 --> 00:25:28,125
(Shocks)

464
00:25:32,041 --> 00:25:33,500
What are you doing?

465
00:25:48,291 --> 00:25:50,875
Hail the leader!
- Victory!

466
00:25:50,958 --> 00:25:53,625
Hail the leader!
- Victory!

467
00:25:53,833 --> 00:25:56,458
Hail the leader!
- Victory!

468
00:25:56,541 --> 00:25:59,000
Hail the leader!
- Victory!

469
00:26:10,875 --> 00:26:14,750
(Audience whistles)

470
00:26:26,291 --> 00:26:27,291
(Sighs)

471
00:26:27,916 --> 00:26:32,750
He is smoking..
I like his smoking modish.

472
00:26:34,375 --> 00:26:35,166
Hi all.

473
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:37,958
I have also smoked cigars once.

474
00:26:38,375 --> 00:26:40,416
But I couldn't enjoy it.

475
00:26:40,625 --> 00:26:44,541
But you all seem to enjoy it very much.
How is it?

476
00:26:44,625 --> 00:26:46,541
Both are different.

477
00:26:47,791 --> 00:26:48,625
Meaning?

478
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:54,458
You know heaven up above the sky?

479
00:26:55,125 --> 00:26:55,875
Yes.

480
00:26:56,166 --> 00:26:58,166
If you take one puff from the cigar..

481
00:26:58,250 --> 00:26:59,333
Ok then?

482
00:26:59,416 --> 00:27:02,416
You can see heaven right down here.

483
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,375
Can I try it?

484
00:27:03,458 --> 00:27:04,375
Yeah you can.

485
00:27:04,458 --> 00:27:05,333
(Take a puff)

486
00:27:07,708 --> 00:27:09,875
This cigar is really good.
I feel no inflammation.

487
00:27:09,958 --> 00:27:10,833
Have some more.

488
00:27:22,875 --> 00:27:25,000
If you come with me,
I'll show you the real heaven..

489
00:27:25,083 --> 00:27:26,333
Hey, hey

490
00:27:27,125 --> 00:27:29,166
(Moans in pain)

491
00:27:32,875 --> 00:27:35,041
He has thrashed Raja's son-in-law.

492
00:27:35,458 --> 00:27:38,208
You have stomped on me right? You're done.

493
00:27:38,291 --> 00:27:42,083
You will die soon. I'll tell
my uncle about it. You will see his rage.

494
00:27:45,541 --> 00:27:46,833
Sorry uncle.

495
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:51,916
I'm responsible for all this confusion.
My brother is not to blame.

496
00:27:52,083 --> 00:27:54,958
Why should you say sorry?
It was our boy who did wrong.

497
00:27:55,166 --> 00:27:56,291
Raghav!

498
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,708
Yes, uncle!
- Say sorry to that girl.

499
00:28:02,875 --> 00:28:04,500
Say sorry to her.
- Please don't mind.

500
00:28:05,333 --> 00:28:07,291
It's okay, brother.
- Say it quickly!

501
00:28:07,541 --> 00:28:09,416
Say sorry to the girl.

502
00:28:10,458 --> 00:28:13,250
Sorry!
- There was no need for you to slap him.

503
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:17,708
I am saying sorry for
the silly thing that he did. - No!

504
00:28:17,791 --> 00:28:19,291
Why should you say sorry, bro?

505
00:28:19,375 --> 00:28:21,833
But you beat my son-in-law in public.

506
00:28:23,708 --> 00:28:25,458
You did a mistake, Deepak.

507
00:28:26,416 --> 00:28:28,000
It was a big mistake.

508
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:31,958
Saying sorry would not be
enough for that mistake.

509
00:28:32,166 --> 00:28:34,791
I will give you an opportunity
for the respect I have for you.

510
00:28:34,875 --> 00:28:37,041
In the same area that
you beat my son-in-law..

511
00:28:37,125 --> 00:28:39,208
..In the same area you should get
trashed by our men.

512
00:28:39,291 --> 00:28:41,541
You must let my respect be restored.

513
00:28:41,625 --> 00:28:43,166
Yes!
- Brother!

514
00:28:43,375 --> 00:28:45,708
Okay, brother.
- Didn't I say that Deepak is a good man?

515
00:28:45,791 --> 00:28:47,458
I take your leave, bro.
- Deepak!

516
00:28:48,083 --> 00:28:51,500
Bro?!
- Till then your sister will stay with me.

517
00:28:51,666 --> 00:28:54,083
Bro?!
- You need not worry.

518
00:28:54,916 --> 00:28:56,791
I will take care of her like my daughter.

519
00:28:56,875 --> 00:28:59,208
That is okay, but brother..

520
00:28:59,291 --> 00:29:00,875
Come, my dear.
We are here to take care.

521
00:29:01,083 --> 00:29:02,958
Madam, please try to understand.

522
00:29:03,125 --> 00:29:05,416
Come, my child.
- Brother!

523
00:29:05,666 --> 00:29:09,666
Both off you act in the TV serials,
you will earn a lot.

524
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,250
Don't be scared, come and sit.

525
00:29:12,541 --> 00:29:16,833
This thrashing isn't enough for him.
You're a total waste.

526
00:29:17,458 --> 00:29:20,541
Just go and sit.
This stomping is not enough.

527
00:29:20,833 --> 00:29:22,500
Rajamundry Devaraj, come!

528
00:29:25,958 --> 00:29:27,750
(Moans in pain)

529
00:29:28,083 --> 00:29:31,208
What are you doing?
Don't you know how to thrash someone?

530
00:29:40,666 --> 00:29:42,333
(Laughs) That's it..

531
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:46,708
That's how you beat someone..

532
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,791
Don't be afraid of us.

533
00:29:49,958 --> 00:29:50,875
He will just get 4 stomping. That's all.

534
00:29:51,666 --> 00:29:54,625
We aren't going to kill your brother.

535
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:02,583
Brother...

536
00:30:02,666 --> 00:30:04,125
(Groans)

537
00:30:04,416 --> 00:30:06,375
Brother.. Brother..

538
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,708
What happened there?

539
00:30:14,125 --> 00:30:16,916
Ahhh... (Shouts)

540
00:30:21,291 --> 00:30:22,041
Hey..

541
00:30:28,208 --> 00:30:29,708
(Shouts in pain)

542
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:36,458
Hey.. hey.. Take your leg off.

543
00:30:36,541 --> 00:30:38,875
Your sister is in our custody.
Don't smart-act now.

544
00:30:38,958 --> 00:30:39,875
Kill him now.

545
00:30:47,458 --> 00:30:49,791
(Screams in pain)

546
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,583
Kill him now.

547
00:32:04,708 --> 00:32:05,541
Hey Deepak.

548
00:32:05,625 --> 00:32:08,666
Your daughter is fond
of her husband right?

549
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,666
No, bro! Please don't harm my sister.

550
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,958
You thought that
I would plead like that?

551
00:32:15,041 --> 00:32:17,958
But your daughter
likes her husband, right?

552
00:32:18,166 --> 00:32:21,083
Raghav.. Raghav.. Where is Raghav?

553
00:32:21,666 --> 00:32:22,916
Don't do anything to him.

554
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:27,083
My daughter will die.
Please don't hurt him.

555
00:32:27,166 --> 00:32:28,750
Don't panic. I won't kill him.

556
00:32:29,041 --> 00:32:31,291
Bring my sister here
and take Raghav with you.

557
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,541
(Tires screeching)

558
00:32:43,208 --> 00:32:43,958
Brother..

559
00:32:44,416 --> 00:32:46,083
Raghav.. Were you hurt?

560
00:32:49,708 --> 00:32:50,375
Sister..

561
00:32:50,458 --> 00:32:52,750
Deepak, you made a mistake.

562
00:32:53,666 --> 00:32:56,541
Do you know how big your mistake is?
- (Phone rings)

563
00:32:56,833 --> 00:32:59,416
In both the States of AP and Telangana..
- Sister!

564
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,833
I will get together all my supporters.

565
00:33:00,916 --> 00:33:02,291
He is not listening to me, sister.

566
00:33:02,375 --> 00:33:04,958
He is just going about his way.
- They will destroy everything.

567
00:33:05,208 --> 00:33:07,125
He is saying punch dialogs!

568
00:33:07,333 --> 00:33:09,125
He is taking the names of movies.

569
00:33:09,208 --> 00:33:11,125
I will grind you to dust.

570
00:33:11,208 --> 00:33:14,375
I will finish anyone who opposes me!
- He is shouting, sister.

571
00:33:14,458 --> 00:33:16,083
It seems he might get a heart attack.

572
00:33:16,666 --> 00:33:18,083
Brother-in-law, take this tablet.

573
00:33:19,291 --> 00:33:21,000
Drink some water.
- Let's not keep fighting.

574
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:23,416
Deepak, will you settle
my money or leave this theatre?

575
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:26,083
Brother I'll return
your money in six months.

576
00:33:26,291 --> 00:33:30,875
Meanwhile if someone wants
to hurt my family I won't be calm.

577
00:33:31,083 --> 00:33:32,250
Brother you're a good man.

578
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:38,583
But people around you
also should be honest people.

579
00:33:40,833 --> 00:33:45,250
Leopard shadows underground
not because its afraid.

580
00:33:46,708 --> 00:33:48,583
It can hunt and succumb you down.

581
00:33:49,458 --> 00:33:51,166
Then nobody will be alive here.

582
00:33:52,375 --> 00:33:53,708
We will meet after 6 months.

583
00:33:54,125 --> 00:33:56,458
Durga Rao,
you cannot settle for 2.5 lakhs.

584
00:33:56,791 --> 00:33:59,583
You promised me 3.5 lakhs.

585
00:34:00,083 --> 00:34:02,375
Sir, you can reduce Rs.1 Lakh.

586
00:34:02,416 --> 00:34:04,125
I'll get the amount from our producer.

587
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:05,750
Also our hero is the "Burning star"

588
00:34:05,958 --> 00:34:07,583
Whatever it may be.

589
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:08,750
I need the promised amount.

590
00:34:08,916 --> 00:34:10,083
That is the reason I
left this place for shooting.

591
00:34:10,416 --> 00:34:13,541
Ok. The film producer is in the Dormobile.
Get it from him.

592
00:34:15,666 --> 00:34:16,583
Greetings sir.

593
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:19,166
You're the theatre owner right? Sit down.
- Yes sir.

594
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:21,375
Thank you.

595
00:34:21,458 --> 00:34:22,625
Give him the payment.

596
00:34:25,708 --> 00:34:29,125
I'm giving the theatre for
this purpose for the first time.

597
00:34:30,041 --> 00:34:31,416
Please make sure there's no chaos sir.

598
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:37,333
(Music)

599
00:34:37,916 --> 00:34:41,375
"After one peg, we get up"

600
00:34:41,458 --> 00:34:44,791
"We are energised after the second peg"

601
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:49,416
"After the third fourth and fifth pegs,
we start dancing"

602
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:52,916
"We started dancing merrily"

603
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:59,083
"Merrily.. Merrily"

604

"We have all the things for enjoyment"

606
00:35:05,333 --> 00:35:08,791
"But the right person is not available"

607
00:35:08,875 --> 00:35:12,083
"We are chic, hot, shapely"

608
00:35:12,166 --> 00:35:15,208
"But no one has the guts to take us on"

609
00:35:15,291 --> 00:35:18,916
"Find the right time and come to me"

610
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,541
"Break the bed and enthrall me"

611
00:35:22,583 --> 00:35:25,958
"I became lovely with almonds and pista"

612
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:29,375
"I have beauty which mesmerizes the gods"

613
00:35:30,833 --> 00:35:34,375
"We have all the things for enjoyment"

614
00:35:34,458 --> 00:35:37,458
"But the right person is not available"

615
00:35:37,833 --> 00:35:41,416
"It is a nice duty to enjoy the beauty"

616
00:35:41,458 --> 00:35:44,750
"It is sweet candy,
I want the duty to enjoy it"

617
00:35:44,916 --> 00:35:48,166
"It is a nice duty to enjoy the beauty"

618
00:35:48,333 --> 00:35:51,666
"It is sweet candy,
I want the duty to enjoy it"

619
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:54,458
"Come, dear man"

620
00:35:55,166 --> 00:35:58,541
"I am ready for a good time and a date"

621
00:35:58,625 --> 00:36:01,000
"Get ready"

622
00:36:01,833 --> 00:36:05,291
"How will you treat me,
will you give the slip"

623
00:36:05,375 --> 00:36:08,916
"My lovely figure I developed for you"

624
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,208
"I reserved it for you"

625
00:36:12,291 --> 00:36:15,666
"I offer my beauty
which is like ice cream"

626
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:19,125
"If you have the power,
take me with you"

627
00:36:20,875 --> 00:36:24,250
"We have all the things for enjoyment"

628
00:36:24,333 --> 00:36:27,583
"But the right person is not available"

629
00:36:27,666 --> 00:36:30,916
"We are chic, hot, shapely"

630
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,041
"But no one has the guts to take us on"

631
00:36:35,291 --> 00:36:38,250
(Music)

632
00:36:56,916 --> 00:36:58,958
5, 6, 7, 8.

633
00:36:59,041 --> 00:37:00,625
1, 2, 3, 4.

634
00:37:00,708 --> 00:37:02,375
5, 6, 7, 8.

635
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:04,708
Pack up.

636
00:37:30,833 --> 00:37:33,125
Movie is boring.
- No this movie is great.

637
00:37:33,166 --> 00:37:34,875
Lets drink something.

638
00:37:36,958 --> 00:37:38,500
My girlfriend will come anytime.

639
00:37:38,583 --> 00:37:40,875
Grandpa. I know him very well.

640
00:37:41,375 --> 00:37:42,708
I couldn't see you for a long time now?

641
00:37:42,791 --> 00:37:45,291
You're an old man, but I'm
a young and energetic guy grandpa..

642
00:37:45,916 --> 00:37:47,625
I'm leaving.
We'll meet at the Red Café.

643
00:37:47,708 --> 00:37:49,541
Are you disguised? You never
told me you work for a porn film theatre?

644
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,083
Did you buy the snacks? Then leave.

645
00:37:52,166 --> 00:37:52,916
What happened grandpa?

646
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,708
There you're an action hero.

647
00:37:54,791 --> 00:37:56,375
Here you're behaving like a joker.

648
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:59,500
What is the matter? Why are you so tense?

649
00:37:59,583 --> 00:38:00,666
My owner is here.
Just leave from here now.

650
00:38:00,708 --> 00:38:02,750
Owner huh? Are you frightened of him?

651
00:38:02,958 --> 00:38:05,541
Are you panicking because
I'll tell him your secrets?

652
00:38:05,625 --> 00:38:09,541
Now I have an urge to tell him.
Hello, boss.

653
00:38:09,625 --> 00:38:16,000
Hey.. stop it. If you subdue
my respect here I'll kill you.

654
00:38:16,083 --> 00:38:17,875
(Laughs)
- Got it? Get lost.

655
00:38:17,958 --> 00:38:19,416
Relax grandpa.

656
00:38:19,875 --> 00:38:20,875
Don't panic.

657
00:38:20,958 --> 00:38:23,750
If you don't want me to let
out your secrets, give me something.

658
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,791
If you do then it will be a secret.

659
00:38:27,333 --> 00:38:29,083
Here, take it and leave this place.

660
00:38:29,166 --> 00:38:30,333
Okay.
- Go.

661
00:38:30,416 --> 00:38:33,791
I love you grandpa.
Lend me more money like this always.

662
00:38:33,958 --> 00:38:36,166
If we set him free,
he might reveal the truth..

663
00:38:37,375 --> 00:38:39,500
..or he might blackmail me for money.

664
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:42,708
We should finish this soon.

665
00:39:10,833 --> 00:39:13,916
I feel like revealing the
truth because of your panic.

666
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:28,541
(Panics)

667
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:31,666
Oh God. One more person has been killed.

668
00:39:34,916 --> 00:39:35,750
Deepak..

669
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:38,833
What happened?

670
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:49,916
(Screams)

671
00:39:50,083 --> 00:39:53,291
Is the movie over?
Who asked you to finish this soon?

672
00:39:53,541 --> 00:39:55,375
He didn't get killed.

673
00:39:55,833 --> 00:39:57,666
Did you plan to kill me?

674
00:39:58,583 --> 00:40:02,041
Did you throw everyone else out?

675
00:40:02,125 --> 00:40:04,416
Hey you, drunkard, movie ended way back.

676
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:05,708
Hey,.. don't call me a drunkard.

677
00:40:05,791 --> 00:40:12,791
Only if I drink and come to your theatre,
the movie will be piquant.

678
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,375
Ok, get out from here.

679
00:40:14,458 --> 00:40:16,500
Hey I got the ticket to watch full movie.

680
00:40:16,541 --> 00:40:17,000
Ok.

681
00:40:17,083 --> 00:40:17,958
I didn't watch the climax.

682
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:18,625
So?

683
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:20,083
If you play the climax once more,
I'll watch and leave.

684
00:40:20,166 --> 00:40:21,500
We cannot do all that. Get out.

685
00:40:21,583 --> 00:40:22,875
I won't go from here without watching it.

686
00:40:22,958 --> 00:40:25,750
Why are you arguing with him?
First throw him out.

687
00:40:26,041 --> 00:40:28,375
If you don't play the climax
again I'm not leaving this seat.

688
00:40:28,458 --> 00:40:29,583
What shall we do now?

689
00:40:30,416 --> 00:40:32,958
You want to see the climax right?
Show me your ticket?

690
00:40:33,583 --> 00:40:35,041
Correct Deepak.
- (Laughs)

691
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:39,791
Your right. I'll show you the ticket,
then you show me the climax.

692
00:40:39,875 --> 00:40:41,625
Alright show me the ticket.

693
00:40:41,916 --> 00:40:45,083
This is bus ticket.
We don't show cinema for this one.

694
00:40:45,583 --> 00:40:48,041
When I have bus ticket,
wont I have your movie ticket?

695
00:40:48,125 --> 00:40:51,708
Did you think I'm a drunkard thief
who watched your movie without a ticket.

696
00:40:51,791 --> 00:40:54,416
Show me your ticket.
- Give me a minute.

697
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,375
This side has more pockets. Just wait.

698
00:40:57,791 --> 00:40:59,916
Where is it? Your still searching?

699
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:01,916
Where is the ticket?
- Where is the ticket?

700
00:41:02,875 --> 00:41:05,791
Hey.. climax is waiting.
- I don't want you to play it just for me.

701
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,250
You wanted to see climax right?
Where are you running?

702
00:41:07,333 --> 00:41:08,791
You don't force me to see the climax.
It's ok. I'm not interested.

703
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:09,500
Alright bye.

704
00:41:09,583 --> 00:41:10,958
I'll go and close the balcony door.

705
00:41:11,041 --> 00:41:11,750
Are you coming?

706
00:41:11,833 --> 00:41:12,500
2 minutes.

707
00:41:15,208 --> 00:41:20,541
Narayanan.. Narayanan what's all this?

708
00:41:20,625 --> 00:41:23,666
He stole some money from our
theatre and kept in his stomach sir.

709
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:25,041
I was trying to take that sir.

710
00:41:25,125 --> 00:41:27,208
I saw you yelling at him in the canteen.

711
00:41:27,291 --> 00:41:28,583
Tell me the truth, you killed him right?

712
00:41:28,666 --> 00:41:31,000
Please don't hurt me sir.

713
00:41:31,083 --> 00:41:33,666
I used to go to hustler when I was young.

714
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:34,791
You have come here after a long time.

715
00:41:34,875 --> 00:41:36,791
Shall I show you a new one?

716
00:41:36,958 --> 00:41:38,875
Not necessary. I want your sister.

717
00:41:38,958 --> 00:41:40,625
Come Jancy. Let's go.

718
00:41:40,666 --> 00:41:42,791
Don't mistake me sir.
From then I know him.

719
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:44,250
Did you kill him?

720
00:41:44,333 --> 00:41:45,125
I killed sir.

721
00:41:45,958 --> 00:41:50,541
I mean I killed all my desires.
I never killed him sir.

722
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,166
I also saw you coming out
of the bathroom the other day.

723
00:41:58,250 --> 00:41:59,875
Don't lie to me, it's you right?

724
00:42:00,083 --> 00:42:04,125
You know that well sir? I'm sorry sir.
I thought you shouldn't know it.

725
00:42:04,208 --> 00:42:04,833
Hey what are you talking about?

726
00:42:04,916 --> 00:42:05,708
I'll tell you.

727
00:42:05,791 --> 00:42:08,583
Sir, I have drinking habits too.

728
00:42:08,875 --> 00:42:12,166
I have hidden the bottle
in the restroom sir.

729
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:15,083
So I go there to drink.

730
00:42:15,666 --> 00:42:16,416
You didn't kill him?

731
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:17,708
I didn't kill him sir.

732
00:42:18,166 --> 00:42:24,208
But I kept pushing this
wood inside like this...

733
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:26,458
..and tried to kill him sir.

734
00:42:27,041 --> 00:42:28,541
But someone else killed him before me sir.

735
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:33,375
If your saying the truth,
you never killed him nor this guy.

736
00:42:34,208 --> 00:42:37,666
Then who else is murdering
all these people?

737
00:42:40,583 --> 00:42:44,333
Yes! I think that Rajubhai killed him.

738
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:45,875
Raju bhai?
- Yes.

739
00:42:46,416 --> 00:42:48,375
It was him.

740
00:42:48,458 --> 00:42:50,416
If his money is not repaid,
he kills people and puts bodies like this.

741
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:53,000
Right. What should we do with this corpse?

742
00:42:53,333 --> 00:42:55,250
No one should know about this,
they will inform police.

743
00:42:57,125 --> 00:42:58,916
We know how to bury people.

744
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,458
Let's take the body and bury it
without anyone coming to know.

745
00:43:01,541 --> 00:43:04,541
Hope what we do is correct.
- I will take care of it.

746
00:43:30,708 --> 00:43:34,125
Usually in our theatre
small problems will occur.

747
00:43:34,291 --> 00:43:37,458
Now people are dying.
I don't understand why?

748
00:43:37,541 --> 00:43:39,083
Deepak can we call the cops?

749
00:43:39,458 --> 00:43:40,208
Just keep quiet.

750
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:42,416
Your tensed and your making me the same.

751
00:43:43,125 --> 00:43:45,375
We can bury this body here.
What's your opinion Narayana?

752
00:43:45,458 --> 00:43:46,541
Nobody is here sir.

753
00:44:09,166 --> 00:44:13,958
Your all caught red handed.

754
00:44:14,041 --> 00:44:15,000
Did you think I'll leave this?
- (Panics)

755
00:44:15,083 --> 00:44:16,958
I'll put you through
agony just wait and watch.

756
00:44:17,041 --> 00:44:18,875
Who is he sir? Is he related to this body?

757
00:44:18,958 --> 00:44:20,958
Didn't I tell you about a drunkard?
That is him.

758
00:44:21,541 --> 00:44:23,791
(Laughs)

759
00:44:23,875 --> 00:44:26,500
You asked me to show
the ticket for the movie.

760
00:44:26,583 --> 00:44:30,625
So here it is. Now show me the movie.

761
00:44:30,708 --> 00:44:31,708
We are burying a dead body sir.

762
00:44:31,791 --> 00:44:33,333
That doesn't matter to me.

763
00:44:33,416 --> 00:44:36,583
I want to watch a movie right now.
I want to see the climax now.

764
00:44:36,666 --> 00:44:37,833
You want to see the climax right?
- Yes.

765
00:44:37,916 --> 00:44:39,291
Sir the dead body.

766
00:44:39,708 --> 00:44:41,166
I'll show you the real cinema now.

767
00:44:42,041 --> 00:44:44,833
I want the real cinema.
- Cauvery get a seat for him.

768
00:44:44,916 --> 00:44:46,458
Bring it soon sister.

769
00:44:48,625 --> 00:44:52,458
Narayanan, this guy is drunk, we will bury
the body saying this is a movie scene.

770
00:44:52,541 --> 00:44:53,916
After he watches let him leave.

771
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:54,833
Ok sir.

772
00:44:55,166 --> 00:44:57,041
Why did you die so soon? (Weeps)

773
00:44:57,125 --> 00:44:58,791
Live cinema is here.

774
00:44:58,875 --> 00:44:59,958
Why did you die so soon?

775
00:45:00,041 --> 00:45:02,541
Cry. Cry some more.
- Who should I give money to?

776
00:45:02,625 --> 00:45:03,791
Why did you die coming here?

777
00:45:03,875 --> 00:45:07,250
(Coughs)
- (Weeping continues)

778
00:45:07,291 --> 00:45:08,958
It feels like I'm drinking water now.

779
00:45:09,041 --> 00:45:09,708
Sir...

780
00:45:09,791 --> 00:45:12,125
This is a sad scene,
but why am I not crying?

781
00:45:13,083 --> 00:45:16,208
Its paining.
Enough. It is paining like real.

782
00:45:17,458 --> 00:45:19,791
Why did you die brother?

783
00:45:19,958 --> 00:45:22,125
Why didn't tell me your dying?

784
00:45:23,291 --> 00:45:25,666
It feels like I'm crying more.

785
00:45:27,458 --> 00:45:29,708
He is thrashing him, but I feel it.

786
00:45:29,791 --> 00:45:32,125
Bury him, feels like I'm being buried.

787
00:45:32,208 --> 00:45:33,541
What a real movie?!

788
00:45:33,625 --> 00:45:35,333
I've never seen such
a live cinema in my life.

789
00:45:35,416 --> 00:45:38,291
Climax is over. End music is being played.

790
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:51,416
Where did this drunkard go?

791
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:56,250
Sorry sir.
I think I buried him with the dead body.

792
00:45:56,333 --> 00:45:56,916
Buried him?

793
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:57,916
Hey...

794
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:02,625
You said you will show cinema
and you're trying to kill me?

795
00:46:02,708 --> 00:46:05,291
I know it now. I know everything now.

796
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:08,375
You will see my power now.
I'll revenge you all.

797
00:46:08,458 --> 00:46:09,375
Hey..

798
00:46:09,666 --> 00:46:14,875
I know your plans now. Your burying
everybody whose watching cinema here?

799
00:46:15,458 --> 00:46:16,583
(Screams of pain)

800
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:24,208
I don't understand anything Deepak.

801
00:46:24,875 --> 00:46:27,166
Already we have dead bodies here.

802
00:46:27,625 --> 00:46:29,833
Meanwhile now we have this drunkard too.

803
00:47:09,541 --> 00:47:13,625
"When I keep looking at you"

804
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:20,750
"My heart is filled with you"

805
00:47:23,166 --> 00:47:29,166
"Somehow I'm able to find my love"

806
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:34,125
"You are my partner"

807
00:47:36,541 --> 00:47:40,666
"My place is in your heart"

808
00:47:43,166 --> 00:47:49,958
"You remain as my hero"

809
00:48:03,791 --> 00:48:05,125
What are you doing madam?

810
00:48:05,208 --> 00:48:06,708
I'm sweeping here.

811
00:48:06,791 --> 00:48:08,083
Your throwing papers down.

812
00:48:08,541 --> 00:48:11,458
You shouldn't tear down
your school books madam.

813
00:48:11,958 --> 00:48:14,125
Ok madam, you tear it all.

814
00:48:16,458 --> 00:48:18,500
"My heart is filled with you"

815
00:48:18,666 --> 00:48:20,708
(Laughs)

816
00:48:23,125 --> 00:48:26,541
"Somehow I am able to find"

817
00:48:26,625 --> 00:48:30,125
I won't leave you.

818
00:48:31,208 --> 00:48:32,500
She littered the floor.

819
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:34,833
Why is she warning me about it?

820
00:48:34,916 --> 00:48:36,583
Will she litter like this everyday?

821
00:48:36,666 --> 00:48:38,000
Then I'm done.

822
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:42,208
(Moans in pain)

823
00:48:42,291 --> 00:48:43,500
Prayer sound is here.

824
00:48:43,583 --> 00:48:45,416
I think it's the dawn.
Then we need to escape from here.

825
00:48:46,458 --> 00:48:47,791
Who is pulling me?

826
00:48:47,875 --> 00:48:49,875
I guess it won't go away.

827
00:48:50,416 --> 00:48:52,375
Thank god I'm not buried.
I should leave this place at once.

828
00:48:52,416 --> 00:48:53,291
Come with me.

829
00:48:56,541 --> 00:48:57,666
Door is the problem.

830
00:48:59,875 --> 00:49:01,416
We need to inform cops about this.

831
00:49:07,333 --> 00:49:11,083
'Dear pick up my call. Pick my call'
(Ringtone)

832
00:49:12,125 --> 00:49:12,833
Hello.

833
00:49:13,083 --> 00:49:14,708
Hello.

834
00:49:14,750 --> 00:49:15,916
Hello.

835
00:49:16,666 --> 00:49:17,916
You called me, tell me.

836
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,916
Sir I'm calling from Sanjay hospital.
I'm Dr. Sujitha.

837
00:49:20,125 --> 00:49:23,125
Sir, your deaf one side.
You can only hear with your left ear.

838
00:49:23,208 --> 00:49:23,750
Hello.

839
00:49:25,625 --> 00:49:26,416

840
00:49:26,625 --> 00:49:29,500

841
00:49:29,583 --> 00:49:32,125
Tell me madam. What do you want?

842
00:49:32,208 --> 00:49:35,083
We have admitted an accident
case in our hospital sir.

843
00:49:35,166 --> 00:49:36,750
I have come near the police station.
I have come police..

844
00:49:38,791 --> 00:49:42,708
From the time he arrived, he's
been murmuring Deepak theatre and murder.

845
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:43,541
I see.

846
00:49:43,625 --> 00:49:45,416
He's bluffing something sir.

847
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:48,958
Malathi, I'm attending my 10th case.

848
00:49:49,458 --> 00:49:50,708
This time I'll get my promotion.

849
00:49:51,208 --> 00:49:56,875
Make my country chicken delicacy
and you be ready. I'll come soon steady.

850
00:49:57,208 --> 00:49:58,791
Haa. ok.

851
00:49:59,958 --> 00:50:02,250
(Laughs) Its Malathi, my wife.

852
00:50:02,458 --> 00:50:03,666
Doctor whose the patient?

853
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:04,541
He is the one sir.

854
00:50:08,125 --> 00:50:10,791
Don't panic.
Me, sub inspector Raghul will protect you.

855
00:50:10,875 --> 00:50:17,208
I know that you went for
a evening show in Deepak Theatre.

856
00:50:17,375 --> 00:50:20,541
Tell me what happened there.

857
00:50:20,625 --> 00:50:22,916
You don't panic.
Sub inspector Raghul is there with you.

858
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:23,458
I'll tell sir.

859
00:50:23,541 --> 00:50:25,333
Constable note it down.

860
00:50:25,375 --> 00:50:26,083
Ok sir.

861
00:50:26,166 --> 00:50:29,125
Yesterday morning I got up,
brushed my teeth..

862
00:50:29,208 --> 00:50:33,125
..and had coffee that my wife made for me.

863
00:50:33,208 --> 00:50:34,500
Then I went to take a dump.

864
00:50:35,083 --> 00:50:36,875
Madam..

865
00:50:36,958 --> 00:50:39,666
..I asked him about yesterday evening,
he is talking about morning events.

866
00:50:39,708 --> 00:50:43,291
He had an accident, so Hiroshima Nirisha,
a disease has accompanied him.

867
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:45,458
Whatever you ask him,
he will say from the beginning.

868
00:50:45,916 --> 00:50:46,833
Shall I say sir?

869
00:50:46,916 --> 00:50:47,833
Yes yes.

870
00:50:48,916 --> 00:50:52,833
Yesterday morning I got up, brushed
my teeth, my wife made me some coffee.

871
00:50:53,041 --> 00:50:55,416
Doctor, why is he starting
from the morning events again?

872
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:57,125
Sir, actually due to that disease,

873
00:50:57,291 --> 00:51:01,125
..if you barge in between his speaking,
he will start from the beginning.

874
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:04,416
Hmm.. Malathi.

875
00:51:04,666 --> 00:51:05,958
Does he have the same disease?

876
00:51:06,041 --> 00:51:07,916
Your husband is having a hard day.

877
00:51:09,875 --> 00:51:10,541
You tell me.

878
00:51:10,625 --> 00:51:14,583
Morning I got up,
brushed my teeth, my wife gave me coffee.

879
00:51:14,666 --> 00:51:16,666
I took a dump after that.

880
00:51:16,750 --> 00:51:18,666
Hey.. how many times will
you get up and take a dump?

881
00:51:18,750 --> 00:51:19,958
What did you think of our sir?

882
00:51:20,041 --> 00:51:23,208
He's a sincere constable Raghul.
Sorry sir. Yes sir.

883
00:51:23,541 --> 00:51:25,250
Hey come here.

884
00:51:25,583 --> 00:51:27,916
Already I am half deaf,
your making me completely deaf?

885
00:51:28,208 --> 00:51:32,416
His speaking is better than yours.
Nobody should utter a word now.

886
00:51:32,958 --> 00:51:35,791
Be quiet. You tell me dear.

887
00:51:35,875 --> 00:51:40,416
I got up in the morning. Brushed my teeth.
Had the coffee my gave me.

888
00:51:40,875 --> 00:51:44,541
Took a dump in my bathroom and came out.

889
00:51:44,625 --> 00:51:46,500
Then I switched on the TV with the remote.

890
00:51:46,583 --> 00:51:48,916
Actor Sivaji Ganesan's Vasantha
Malaigai movie song was playing.

891
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,291
(Sings 'Yarukaga Ithu Yarukaga')

892
00:51:50,375 --> 00:51:54,708
(Song from the famous
Tamil movie Vasantha Maligai)

893
00:51:54,958 --> 00:51:56,166
After that the lyrics..?

894
00:51:56,250 --> 00:51:57,916
Nethu Rathiri (Song from Tamil movie
'Sakalakala Vallavan')

895
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,166
Start singing from there.

896
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
His torment is better than yours.

897
00:52:04,083 --> 00:52:04,666
This is getting more crazy.

898
00:52:04,875 --> 00:52:07,291
Slip a plaster on your mouths now.

899
00:52:10,791 --> 00:52:11,500
You start dear.

900
00:52:11,583 --> 00:52:15,416
I got up in the morning. Brushed my teeth.
Had the coffee my wife made for me.

901
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:17,375
Afternoon had lunch too.

902
00:52:17,666 --> 00:52:21,125
That time Venkatesh phoned me.

903
00:52:21,208 --> 00:52:23,500
I asked him the purpose of the call.

904
00:52:23,583 --> 00:52:26,708
He invited me to the evening party.

905
00:52:26,791 --> 00:52:31,875
I asked him why is he being so formal?
- (Cough)

906
00:52:32,958 --> 00:52:35,791
You old sack, why did you cough now?

907
00:52:36,041 --> 00:52:36,958
Why did you?

908
00:52:37,166 --> 00:52:39,500
Already in this corona
issue people are panicking.

909
00:52:40,166 --> 00:52:41,583
Malathi...

910
00:52:42,250 --> 00:52:43,625
You tell me dear.

911
00:52:45,041 --> 00:52:48,208
Tell me. After that what happened?
Tell me darling. Say it.

912
00:52:48,291 --> 00:52:50,666
I got up in the morning. Brushed my teeth.

913
00:52:51,458 --> 00:52:53,166
Afternoon I had tummy full lunch.

914
00:52:53,458 --> 00:52:54,583
Then Venkatesh phoned me

915
00:52:54,666 --> 00:52:55,666
Bell rang in the phone.

916
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:57,541
He isn't leaving even the phone sound.

917
00:52:57,583 --> 00:52:59,458
I asked him the purpose for his call.

918
00:52:59,541 --> 00:53:04,541
He invited me to a party in the evening.

919
00:53:04,625 --> 00:53:05,875
I asked him the time
and venue of the party.

920
00:53:05,958 --> 00:53:08,458
Then both of us left for the bar

921
00:53:08,541 --> 00:53:12,750
We went tipsy. We thought of leaving home.

922
00:53:12,833 --> 00:53:17,458
On the way home we saw a lustful
movie poster in Deepak Theatre.

923
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:19,791
Without a thought I got
the ticket and went inside.

924
00:53:19,875 --> 00:53:23,291
With full concentration I was
watching the movie, good scene came.

925
00:53:23,375 --> 00:53:24,458
I dozed off.

926
00:53:24,541 --> 00:53:26,708
As soon as I opened my eyes,
I realised I missed the climax.

927
00:53:27,083 --> 00:53:29,916
So I called the owner
& told him I missed the climax.

928
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,708
He yelled at me back asking for my ticket,
so I got one more ticket and came back.

929
00:53:33,791 --> 00:53:35,833
That time they were doing
something else. What...!

930
00:53:35,916 --> 00:53:37,875
(Farts)

931
00:53:39,541 --> 00:53:43,416
Why did you fart idiot?
Why can't you control it for a while?

932
00:53:43,791 --> 00:53:46,500
Sir you came here early morning 9 am.

933
00:53:46,583 --> 00:53:47,500
Now the time is 2PM.

934
00:53:47,583 --> 00:53:49,708
6 hours, I controlled it very well.

935
00:53:49,791 --> 00:53:55,000
Now that I released it,
I feel very relaxed.

936
00:53:55,083 --> 00:53:55,833
Say no more.

937
00:53:55,916 --> 00:53:58,041
We aren't here to listen
to your fart stories.

938
00:53:58,250 --> 00:53:59,958
If you had swayed for sometime more.

939
00:54:00,166 --> 00:54:02,541
He would have finished his story
and I would have got my promotion.

940
00:54:02,625 --> 00:54:04,833
Seal all his holes at once.

941
00:54:06,208 --> 00:54:07,166
You say me dear.

942
00:54:07,250 --> 00:54:11,250
I got up in the morning, brushed my teeth,
had the coffee my wife gave me.

943
00:54:12,375 --> 00:54:14,458
After I woke up realised
I missed the climax.

944
00:54:14,541 --> 00:54:17,250
Hence I called the owner to replay it.

945
00:54:17,416 --> 00:54:19,416
He asked me for the ticket..

946
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:21,083
..so I went out got another
ticket and came back inside.

947
00:54:21,166 --> 00:54:24,541
They were into other work.
I asked him for the climax.

948
00:54:25,208 --> 00:54:29,125
Hasn't your enquiry done for the day?

949
00:54:29,625 --> 00:54:30,750
Malathi... (Faints)

950
00:54:30,833 --> 00:54:33,958
Why did you call me Venkatesh I asked him?

951
00:54:34,041 --> 00:54:36,250
He invited me to a party in the evening.

952
00:54:36,375 --> 00:54:39,958
I told him, I'm eager to come
to the party. We boozed well in the bar.

953
00:54:41,041 --> 00:54:43,125
Oh god. His Blood pressure is shooting up.

954
00:54:43,208 --> 00:54:44,750
Then, we left home.

955
00:54:44,833 --> 00:54:48,291
On the way, I saw a lewd
movie poster in Deepak theatre.

956
00:54:48,458 --> 00:54:51,000
I got the ticket and went inside.
I sat on the seat.

957
00:54:51,083 --> 00:54:55,000
I was watching the movie,
and then I slept off through the climax.

958
00:54:55,166 --> 00:54:56,750
I asked them to replay the climax.

959
00:54:56,833 --> 00:54:58,791
After that they asked me
for a ticket to replay the climax.

960
00:54:58,875 --> 00:55:02,208
I went out to buy the ticket.
They were doing something else.

961
00:55:02,291 --> 00:55:04,333
From morning you have
been bluffing the same thing.

962
00:55:04,541 --> 00:55:05,833
You never got up from morning.

963
00:55:05,875 --> 00:55:06,750
Who said?

964
00:55:06,916 --> 00:55:08,875
I got up morning,
brushed my teeth, took a dump too.

965
00:55:08,958 --> 00:55:10,291
You never had lunch.

966
00:55:10,333 --> 00:55:14,166
Who said? Venkatesh called me,
while I was having my lunch.

967
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:15,916
You never went to the movie theatre.

968
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:20,333
You dinosaur face, I went to the theatre,
I even saw a live movie.

969
00:55:20,416 --> 00:55:24,250
I saw it they were burying two
bodies at once. I saw it with my own eyes.

970
00:55:25,125 --> 00:55:27,875
This is the twist.
Now anybody can fart, anybody can speak.

971
00:55:27,958 --> 00:55:30,541
He came out of the disease.

972
00:55:30,625 --> 00:55:31,208
Yes..

973
00:55:31,291 --> 00:55:32,583
From now he will speak normally.

974
00:55:51,833 --> 00:55:56,583
Narayana... guess what I have bought you.

975
00:55:56,916 --> 00:55:58,083
What is it madam?

976
00:55:58,958 --> 00:56:00,333
New outfit for you.

977
00:56:00,416 --> 00:56:02,125
You are always wearing these old rugs.

978
00:56:02,583 --> 00:56:03,958
I never liked them on you.

979
00:56:04,041 --> 00:56:07,583
I've got you new kurta. Here wear it now.

980
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,125
Not necessary madam.
- No wear it.

981
00:56:09,208 --> 00:56:10,000
No madam.

982
00:56:10,083 --> 00:56:10,875
Listen to me, wear it.

983
00:56:10,958 --> 00:56:11,708
Listen to me madam.

984
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:14,166
Wait I'll put it on you.
Lift your hands up.

985
00:56:15,083 --> 00:56:17,250
No madam, I'll wear it myself.

986
00:56:19,416 --> 00:56:21,250
"My place is in your heart"

987
00:56:21,333 --> 00:56:22,250
(Laughs)

988
00:56:22,333 --> 00:56:23,875
You look so handsome.

989
00:56:26,083 --> 00:56:29,708
"You appear like my hero"

990
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,916
She couldn't tolerate
my stink of my body I guess.

991
00:56:33,166 --> 00:56:37,125
Why didn't she simplify
and buy me a perfume?

992
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:38,750
She just a child.

993
00:56:38,958 --> 00:56:41,375
(Police siren wails)

994
00:56:42,333 --> 00:56:45,041
Just stop it. Get down sir.

995
00:56:45,208 --> 00:56:48,416
Thrash this theatre owner
and hell furnish you all the details.

996
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:49,291
He is the theatre owner.

997
00:56:49,375 --> 00:56:50,250
Greetings sir.

998
00:56:50,458 --> 00:56:51,708
Ticket counter is closed sir.

999
00:56:52,166 --> 00:56:53,250
You're a murderer.

1000
00:56:53,666 --> 00:56:55,041
Murderer movie is running now sir.

1001
00:56:55,125 --> 00:56:56,666
We cannot play any
lewd scenes in this sir.

1002
00:56:56,750 --> 00:56:58,041
I didn't come here for those scenes.

1003
00:56:58,125 --> 00:56:58,708
Ah.. sir..

1004
00:56:58,791 --> 00:57:00,750
I have come here to check your premises.

1005
00:57:00,833 --> 00:57:01,500
You can check sir.

1006
00:57:01,583 --> 00:57:04,291
If someone utters this
sub inspector Raghul's name..

1007
00:57:04,375 --> 00:57:05,666
..suspect's heart
will pound like a train.

1008
00:57:05,750 --> 00:57:07,875
Sir, when is Nellai Express train?

1009
00:57:08,166 --> 00:57:10,583
I need to reach Madurai.

1010
00:57:11,125 --> 00:57:12,291
Can you come to the front?

1011
00:57:13,458 --> 00:57:15,583
Oh God.. I'll cancel my trip..
Leave me sir.

1012
00:57:16,583 --> 00:57:17,583
Why are you thrashing me for travelling.

1013
00:57:17,666 --> 00:57:21,041
I stomped you because you
were talking into my deaf right ear.

1014
00:57:21,250 --> 00:57:23,083
Come this side, and tell me again.

1015
00:57:23,208 --> 00:57:25,791
You earless frog,
don't thrash me continuously..

1016
00:57:25,875 --> 00:57:27,291
..hear everything and investigate.

1017
00:57:27,375 --> 00:57:30,083
How did they designate you
in police with this deafened ear?

1018
00:57:30,166 --> 00:57:32,291
Don't keep stomping, investigate better.

1019
00:57:33,166 --> 00:57:33,625
Come to the front.

1020
00:57:33,708 --> 00:57:35,250
You follow me first.
I'll show you the body.

1021
00:57:35,458 --> 00:57:36,333
Search.

1022
00:57:39,916 --> 00:57:41,666
It was here somewhere.

1023
00:57:42,291 --> 00:57:44,291
Why is he taking round turns?

1024
00:57:44,375 --> 00:57:45,625
Its over there.

1025
00:57:46,125 --> 00:57:47,833
It was right here. Where is it now?

1026
00:57:49,208 --> 00:57:50,458
Will he stomp me again?

1027
00:57:50,750 --> 00:57:53,291
Sir you cannot take a leak here.
Restroom is over there.

1028
00:57:53,375 --> 00:57:56,416
If I bury the dead body from here.
You'll take a leak.

1029
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:58,291
You said it right, we buried it here.

1030
00:57:58,375 --> 00:57:59,125
He concurred the truth.

1031
00:57:59,208 --> 00:58:02,166
If you want to say something,
say it to my left ear.

1032
00:58:02,208 --> 00:58:03,625
Narayana, come here.

1033
00:58:04,958 --> 00:58:10,291
Sir.. he's asking how
do you believe this drunkard?

1034
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:12,333
He spoke in this ear.

1035
00:58:12,625 --> 00:58:20,541
Moreover he repeated the same
dialogues for a day and deceased me.

1036
00:58:20,625 --> 00:58:22,916
That is why this sub inspector Raghul..

1037
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:27,708
..trusted his words and is
about to take out the buried bodies.

1038
00:58:27,958 --> 00:58:29,083
Search the body.

1039
00:58:29,166 --> 00:58:30,375
Sir.
- Come here.. Come..

1040
00:58:30,458 --> 00:58:32,916
Your spending time on his worthless words.
- Start digging here.

1041
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,041
Don't speak with him.
He will persuade you.

1042
00:58:35,125 --> 00:58:36,083
Will we be apprehended?

1043
00:58:36,333 --> 00:58:37,541
Sir, how much time are you digging here?

1044
00:58:37,625 --> 00:58:38,500
Until the I find the body!

1045
00:58:38,583 --> 00:58:39,208
Faster, dig quick..

1046
00:58:39,458 --> 00:58:41,291
Sir it doesn't seem
your searching for the body.

1047
00:58:41,375 --> 00:58:43,125
It feels like we are going to bury some.
- Faster, dig quick.

1048
00:58:43,208 --> 00:58:45,458
Don't be hasty. Quick..

1049
00:58:46,833 --> 00:58:48,458
What a shame.

1050
00:58:48,791 --> 00:58:50,875
Your getting water at 10 ft here?

1051
00:58:51,791 --> 00:58:55,458
We didn't get the body
but reached to the water level.

1052
00:58:55,541 --> 00:58:57,791
I already warned you
there was no dead body here.

1053
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,708
If you want a dead body bury him under,
he will be dead body soon.

1054
00:59:01,791 --> 00:59:04,416
Sir, in our theatre...
- Narayanan..

1055
00:59:04,625 --> 00:59:06,250
Whatever you want to tell him,
tell it this side.

1056
00:59:06,333 --> 00:59:08,666
Sir, then you will
be able to listen to him.

1057
00:59:08,750 --> 00:59:10,500
Are they deriding me?

1058
00:59:11,333 --> 00:59:14,291
We had water scarcity
here for many months.

1059
00:59:14,541 --> 00:59:17,250
You came found the water body sir.
Thank you very much sir.

1060
00:59:17,333 --> 00:59:18,166
Come to the front.

1061
00:59:18,375 --> 00:59:23,125
You always keep saying come
to the front & keep palpitating me.

1062
00:59:25,041 --> 00:59:26,708
Whichever ear I tell him,
he is never going to understand it.

1063
00:59:26,916 --> 00:59:28,333
Tell him you never found any dead body.

1064
00:59:29,958 --> 00:59:33,458
This family does magic sir.

1065
00:59:33,708 --> 00:59:34,958
You are not aware of them.

1066
00:59:35,041 --> 00:59:36,500
They even kidnapped me for
two days thinking I'll call you.

1067
00:59:36,583 --> 00:59:37,916
Wont they hide the dead body also?

1068
00:59:38,083 --> 00:59:40,291
If you think well,
you can find the dead body sir.

1069
00:59:40,333 --> 00:59:44,541
'Darling please pick up my call..'
(ringtone)

1070
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:47,875
Malathi... oh wrong ear.

1071
00:59:48,041 --> 00:59:49,208
Whose that?

1072
00:59:49,541 --> 00:59:51,208
Malathi.. Not you dear.

1073
00:59:51,291 --> 00:59:53,583
The next body will be yours.
- I have wasted two days.

1074
00:59:54,416 --> 00:59:59,791
Next month I'll be with you for 4 days.
It's a promise.

1075
01:00:00,208 --> 01:00:03,083
Sir, you should find the dead body..

1076
01:00:03,166 --> 01:00:05,000
..instead your romancing
with your other body.

1077
01:00:05,083 --> 01:00:08,791
Sir, lets search inside, otherwise
they will hide the body from there too.

1078
01:00:08,875 --> 01:00:13,041
I can remember my wife and also you.
Do you get it?

1079
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:15,166
Come on search.

1080
01:00:15,541 --> 01:00:16,750
Come sir. This place sir.

1081
01:00:31,458 --> 01:00:33,250
Sir, they would have concealed
it here somewhere. Search sir.

1082
01:00:42,458 --> 01:00:44,000
Take your hand moron. Don't disturb me.

1083
01:00:45,291 --> 01:00:46,666
I'm not a homosexual.

1084
01:00:50,041 --> 01:00:51,250
Hello get up.

1085
01:00:57,083 --> 01:00:58,916
Hey, what are you doing?

1086
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
You dead rag.

1087
01:01:01,083 --> 01:01:04,000
My name is Yogi dharma.
I'll kill you with my finger. Hey..

1088
01:01:06,333 --> 01:01:09,708
Your insulting my serenity.
Now see me in action.

1089
01:01:16,625 --> 01:01:18,083
Sir, yogi dharma sir.

1090
01:01:18,166 --> 01:01:18,916
Yeah it's me

1091
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,041
How are you?
- I'm good.

1092
01:01:20,083 --> 01:01:22,625
Why is he sleeping like this? Is he alive?

1093
01:01:23,375 --> 01:01:25,916
He nudged me in the wrong place.
I've used Varma art on him.

1094
01:01:25,958 --> 01:01:27,416
I'll revoke him once movie gets over.

1095
01:01:27,833 --> 01:01:29,625
Super sir. Lets meet again soon.

1096
01:01:37,750 --> 01:01:39,916
Are you kicking a cop.

1097
01:01:42,416 --> 01:01:44,041
Your glaring me too.

1098
01:01:44,625 --> 01:01:46,041
Your making me fierce.

1099
01:01:46,875 --> 01:01:48,083
I'm sub inspector Raghul.

1100
01:01:48,125 --> 01:01:49,000
Apologize to me.

1101
01:01:49,541 --> 01:01:50,416
Get up you bugger.

1102
01:02:07,708 --> 01:02:08,416
Ahh (Screams of pain)

1103
01:02:12,291 --> 01:02:13,916
Your beating a cop?

1104
01:02:14,458 --> 01:02:18,875
Your thrashing me in my private area?
You.. shag...

1105
01:02:24,125 --> 01:02:26,958
If you mess up with sub
inspector Raghul you will be dead.

1106
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,083
(Applause)

1107
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:33,125
What kind of cop is he? Instead of inquiry
he is been thrashing a guy.

1108
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,125
Sir.. sir.. Listen to me.

1109
01:02:37,208 --> 01:02:39,041
I'm uttering the truth.
- There is no dead body.

1110
01:02:40,041 --> 01:02:41,041
There is no dead body.

1111
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:42,583
Thank you.

1112
01:02:43,458 --> 01:02:44,291
Trust me sir.

1113
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:45,875
Did you find it sir?

1114
01:02:46,041 --> 01:02:47,833
We didn't even find a dirt.

1115
01:02:48,125 --> 01:02:51,958
Your listening to this
bugger and wasted your vigour.

1116
01:02:52,916 --> 01:02:55,250
Sir, I assure you I saw two dead bodies.

1117
01:02:55,416 --> 01:02:58,041
I saw it 3D effect,
they buried it right there.

1118
01:02:58,083 --> 01:02:58,666
You shag..

1119
01:02:58,708 --> 01:02:59,708
What you heard is true.
- Sir!

1120
01:02:59,791 --> 01:03:03,166
Sir take off your hands from me,
at least now will you trust me?

1121
01:03:03,250 --> 01:03:04,083
Narayanan...

1122
01:03:04,666 --> 01:03:05,666
He did see sir.

1123
01:03:05,833 --> 01:03:07,333
But it was the climax of the movie.

1124
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:09,125
He saw burial of two dead bodies.

1125
01:03:09,208 --> 01:03:10,000
(Gasping)

1126
01:03:11,750 --> 01:03:13,041
Where are we going sir?

1127
01:03:17,041 --> 01:03:18,666
Hospital or police station?

1128
01:03:18,750 --> 01:03:20,958
I never spoke to my wife
Malathi because of your chaos. Go.

1129
01:03:23,416 --> 01:03:25,000
We found his abscond at the right time.

1130
01:03:25,083 --> 01:03:25,791
Yes sir.

1131
01:03:27,666 --> 01:03:28,500
Narayanan..

1132
01:03:28,750 --> 01:03:29,291
That drunkard bolted.

1133
01:03:29,375 --> 01:03:32,125
Before he comes back with police,
we need to hide these dead bodies.

1134
01:03:32,291 --> 01:03:35,041
Shall we unearth them,
and bury them in another place? - Shut up!

1135
01:03:35,416 --> 01:03:39,708
Let us clean both the dead bodies and
put in between the audience in theatre.

1136
01:03:39,958 --> 01:03:41,250
Ok sir. But body will foul-smelled sir.

1137
01:03:41,333 --> 01:03:42,208
Just litter some alcohol on it.

1138
01:03:42,291 --> 01:03:43,000
They will think the guy is drunk.

1139
01:03:43,291 --> 01:03:45,583
We are still not aware
who did these murders.

1140
01:03:45,875 --> 01:03:47,250
But for now dead body chaos is over.

1141
01:03:47,416 --> 01:03:49,083
We must celebrate
Vinayaka Chaturti grandly.

1142
01:03:49,666 --> 01:03:53,083
(Music)

1143
01:04:07,333 --> 01:04:10,750

1144
01:04:10,833 --> 01:04:15,083

1145
01:04:17,625 --> 01:04:21,041

1146

young Ganesha"

1147
01:04:24,875 --> 01:04:28,083
"Grant us victory and energy"

1148
01:04:28,166 --> 01:04:31,666

heroic Ganesha"

1149
01:04:31,750 --> 01:04:35,458

I have nothing to fear"

1152
01:04:42,541 --> 01:04:46,041

1153
01:04:46,083 --> 01:04:49,583
"This is a great chance, use it"

1154
01:04:49,666 --> 01:04:53,375
"Pick your target, and achieve it"

1155
01:04:53,458 --> 01:04:58,208
(Music)

1156
01:05:10,833 --> 01:05:14,291
"Never mind
whether you are young or old"

1157
01:05:14,375 --> 01:05:17,833
"We must learn to imbibe
all the good things"

1158
01:05:17,916 --> 01:05:20,875
"Everyone gets to live a human life"

1159
01:05:21,041 --> 01:05:24,916
"But you must be able to convert
that into a success"

1160
01:05:24,958 --> 01:05:28,416
"Don't wait for someone
to help you to stand up"

1161
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:31,875
"You will be the hero if you wipe tears
and move forward"

1162
01:05:31,958 --> 01:05:35,458
"People will follow you
if this is the truth"

1163
01:05:35,541 --> 01:05:38,958
"You will succeed in every endeavour
if you believe in yourself"

1164
01:05:39,041 --> 01:05:42,541
"This is a great chance, use it"

1165
01:05:42,625 --> 01:05:46,083
"Pick your target, and achieve it"

1166
01:05:46,166 --> 01:05:49,916
(Music)

1167
01:06:13,041 --> 01:06:14,250
(Thundering)

1168
01:06:42,583 --> 01:06:43,833
Good morning sir.

1169
01:06:57,291 --> 01:06:58,250
(Moans in hangover)

1170
01:06:58,333 --> 01:06:59,083
Hey.

1171
01:07:03,875 --> 01:07:07,000
(Screams)
- (Gunshot)

1172
01:07:08,250 --> 01:07:12,500
We haven't come to watch action film here,
play the lewd scene soon.

1173
01:07:12,583 --> 01:07:16,125
We will leave. Play the lewd scene.
(Crowd screams)

1174
01:07:20,166 --> 01:07:22,166
(Audience whistles)

1175
01:07:23,250 --> 01:07:26,291
We expected this.
Now the movie is getting more craving.

1176
01:07:26,916 --> 01:07:29,833
"When I keep looking at you"

1177
01:07:30,416 --> 01:07:33,000
I won't leave you.

1178
01:07:33,458 --> 01:07:37,125
"You fill my heart"
- (Laughs)

1179
01:07:41,541 --> 01:07:45,375
Hey Narayana.. Hi Cheenu. What is this?

1180
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:48,083
It's a special gift for you.

1181
01:07:52,041 --> 01:07:54,208
Cheenu did you think I'm addicted to this?

1182
01:07:54,291 --> 01:07:59,458
Don't get furious.
One minute. Take this. Open it.

1183
01:08:00,625 --> 01:08:01,458
Is it a pen?
- Yes.

1184
01:08:01,541 --> 01:08:02,291
Will it write?

1185
01:08:02,375 --> 01:08:06,291
Yes, I'll write.. I..

1186
01:08:06,791 --> 01:08:07,916
I..

1187
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:10,666
Rain.. (Giggles)

1188
01:08:11,041 --> 01:08:15,875
Hey... wow.. (Giggles)

1189
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:27,625
You..

1190
01:09:04,916 --> 01:09:09,250
"When I keep looking at you"

1191
01:09:11,791 --> 01:09:15,583
"You fill my heart"

1192
01:09:16,375 --> 01:09:18,041
Hi Narayana..

1193
01:09:18,791 --> 01:09:20,291
Why are you here at this time madam?

1194
01:09:20,375 --> 01:09:21,375
Are you insomniac?

1195
01:09:21,458 --> 01:09:22,291
Yes..

1196
01:09:23,541 --> 01:09:28,375
I couldn't sleep.
I wanted to know what will make me sleep.

1197
01:09:28,583 --> 01:09:31,041
Mahima, you go sleep.

1198
01:09:33,125 --> 01:09:34,041
Mahima..

1199
01:09:34,125 --> 01:09:35,166
(Giggles)

1200
01:09:37,250 --> 01:09:40,166
Do not switch off the lights..
Please switch it on.

1201
01:09:43,291 --> 01:09:45,750
I'm already blind in the daylight.

1202
01:09:46,083 --> 01:09:48,041
Now it's pitch-dark.

1203
01:09:50,416 --> 01:09:52,166
She is still Kiddush.

1204
01:09:58,791 --> 01:10:00,791
I'm stuck in this film roll.

1205
01:10:01,416 --> 01:10:03,750
I can't unroll it. Can you help?

1206
01:10:04,958 --> 01:10:06,166
Please...

1207
01:10:09,541 --> 01:10:11,625
Come Narayana. Please.

1208
01:10:18,250 --> 01:10:20,000
Why did you do this madam?

1209
01:10:52,041 --> 01:10:56,625
"When I see you"

1210
01:10:58,541 --> 01:11:02,833
"You fill my heart"

1211
01:11:05,250 --> 01:11:11,500
"Somehow I look at you with love."

1212
01:11:12,375 --> 01:11:14,000
Thanks Narayanan.

1213
01:11:41,291 --> 01:11:43,291
What happened to this Mahima?

1214
01:11:43,333 --> 01:11:44,916
Why is she behaving this way?

1215
01:11:54,791 --> 01:11:55,333
Wear this on!

1216
01:11:55,416 --> 01:11:55,916
No madam.

1217
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,958
Wear this I say!

1218
01:12:15,083 --> 01:12:17,791
Switch on the lights Mahima.

1219
01:12:18,833 --> 01:12:24,583
Unroll me from this.
Please. Come Narayanan.

1220
01:12:37,916 --> 01:12:42,875
As Mahima grew up here, she
has learnt everything from these movies.

1221
01:13:00,458 --> 01:13:01,833
Just look how she has hurted my son.

1222
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,166
He did me wrong, so I did it.

1223
01:13:03,250 --> 01:13:05,541
When Mahima imitates
scenes from the cinema.

1224
01:13:06,208 --> 01:13:08,958
I thought she was acting all childish.

1225
01:13:09,250 --> 01:13:11,500
But after seeing all these incidents.

1226
01:13:13,791 --> 01:13:19,833
One day, she dressed as the
character in one of our porn films.

1227
01:13:20,333 --> 01:13:27,458
I thought she was just
imitating it for fun.

1228
01:13:31,708 --> 01:13:32,625
(Calling out)

1229
01:14:20,125 --> 01:14:23,000
After seeing Nagu's dead body that day..

1230
01:14:23,083 --> 01:14:25,833
..it was the same way how the
heroine killed the villain in that movie.

1231
01:14:25,916 --> 01:14:29,291
Now, I doubt Mahima for that murder sir.

1232
01:14:31,291 --> 01:14:35,166
(Laughs)

1233
01:14:36,750 --> 01:14:38,750
I guess just like the other cinema..

1234
01:14:38,958 --> 01:14:43,416
..I doubt she murdered
Broker James the other day.

1235
01:15:31,083 --> 01:15:33,291
Except for this movie's climax..

1236
01:15:34,375 --> 01:15:37,041
..Mahima has imitated
all the other movie's endings.

1237
01:15:39,166 --> 01:15:40,791
Now this movie's climax is playing sir.

1238
01:15:42,291 --> 01:15:46,916
"When I look at you"

1239
01:15:48,875 --> 01:15:53,041
"You fill my heart"

1240
01:15:55,625 --> 01:16:00,916
"Somehow I look and love you."

1241
01:16:02,250 --> 01:16:06,291
"I want to be with you"

1242
01:16:08,958 --> 01:16:13,166
"My place is in your heart"

1243
01:16:15,583 --> 01:16:21,750
"You appear like my hero."

1244
01:16:32,250 --> 01:16:33,375
Narayanan.

1245
01:16:57,666 --> 01:16:58,625
I unable to believe this.

1246
01:16:58,708 --> 01:17:00,250
Even I couldn't believe it sir.

1247
01:17:00,333 --> 01:17:01,583
Did our Mahima?

1248
01:17:04,125 --> 01:17:05,750
She is not in her mental state sir.

1249
01:17:05,833 --> 01:17:09,333
Whatever we explain to her now,
she won't appreciate it.

1250
01:17:09,750 --> 01:17:12,208
Her life is now cinema sir.

1251
01:17:12,416 --> 01:17:13,875
I'm leaving sir.

1252
01:17:14,166 --> 01:17:18,208
Please show our Mahima
to a good psychiatrist.

1253
01:17:18,291 --> 01:17:22,458
She won't remember anything
tomorrow at dawn sir.

1254
01:17:22,541 --> 01:17:24,666
Cheenu will maintain our theatre.

1255
01:17:25,083 --> 01:17:27,625
I'm leaving sir.
May all good deeds follow you sir.

1256
01:17:31,333 --> 01:17:34,250
She is not in her mental state sir.

1257
01:17:35,750 --> 01:17:39,750
Whatever we explain to her now,
she won't appreciate it.

1258
01:17:40,708 --> 01:17:43,166
She is not in her mental state sir.

1259
01:17:45,125 --> 01:17:46,333
It's my mistake.

1260
01:17:46,583 --> 01:17:48,666
I shouldn't have behaved
like that to an elder.

1261
01:17:48,750 --> 01:17:50,125
It's my fault.

1262
01:17:50,208 --> 01:17:53,666
It's always been mine.
I have to die, that's the one way now.

1263
01:17:53,750 --> 01:17:56,583
(Screams)

1264
01:17:59,958 --> 01:18:01,333
It's my mistake.

1265
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,166
I shouldn't have behaved
like that to an elder.

1266
01:18:05,791 --> 01:18:11,500
I have to die, that's the one way now.

1267
01:18:12,666 --> 01:18:14,000
(Screams)

1268
01:18:20,833 --> 01:18:22,083
Brother.

1269
01:18:27,541 --> 01:18:28,750
Brother.

1270
01:19:00,875 --> 01:19:03,708
Who are you, tell me.

1271
01:20:57,500 --> 01:20:59,458
You beat me in the theatre
before everyone.

1272
01:20:59,666 --> 01:21:03,291
But you made my father-in-law slap me
in front of ladies at home.

1273
01:21:03,333 --> 01:21:06,000
I can never forget that.

1274
01:21:09,791 --> 01:21:12,875
I thought I should
kill your entire family.

1275
01:21:13,666 --> 01:21:16,666
Now that's not necessary.

1276
01:21:16,958 --> 01:21:19,125
Your own kith and kin
will destroy themselves.

1277
01:21:19,208 --> 01:21:21,458
(Wicked laugh)

1278
01:21:21,708 --> 01:21:24,625
Do you know who it is?
(Laugh) Your sweet sibling.

1279
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:28,708
Your sister has some mental disorder?

1280
01:21:29,083 --> 01:21:32,500
She will turn herself into
whatever character she sees in a film?

1281
01:21:33,833 --> 01:21:35,833
You're uncertain about how I know this?

1282
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:39,333
The projector man Narayanan
from your theatre..

1283
01:21:39,541 --> 01:21:40,500
Hello!

1284
01:21:40,833 --> 01:21:42,666
You are Narayana
who works in the Deepak Theater, right?

1285
01:21:42,708 --> 01:21:43,416
Yes.

1286
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:47,625
Why are you going with all your belongings,
did they remove you from work? - No.

1287
01:21:48,166 --> 01:21:50,875
I cannot reveal that to anyone.
- Okay, don't do it.

1288
01:21:51,333 --> 01:21:54,041
Who are you to advise me?
I will tell you.

1289
01:21:57,666 --> 01:22:01,083
Narayana told everything
about your sister.

1290
01:22:01,458 --> 01:22:03,625
Now you know what movie
is playing in your theatre?

1291
01:22:03,708 --> 01:22:06,250
In the end of the movie,
the heroine kills everyone in her family.

1292
01:22:06,333 --> 01:22:08,208
'The killing family'.

1293
01:22:08,291 --> 01:22:09,291
(Furiously screams)

1294
01:22:09,375 --> 01:22:12,250
Which is why I have locked you up here.

1295
01:22:12,583 --> 01:22:14,458
Thinking that I made the mistake
by holding your sister..

1296
01:22:14,541 --> 01:22:17,083
..my father in law let
you go out of sympathy.

1297
01:22:18,041 --> 01:22:21,541
I'm handling this projector
for the first time. Let's try it once.

1298
01:22:34,416 --> 01:22:37,041
Kill him. Kill him.

1299
01:22:37,125 --> 01:22:42,083
Kill him. Kill him. Kill him.

1300
01:22:42,166 --> 01:22:43,666
Kill him. Kill him.

1301
01:22:55,083 --> 01:22:59,750
Kill everyone.

1302
01:23:11,666 --> 01:23:14,958
Hey Mahi..
Why are you holding a knife in hand?

1303
01:23:15,291 --> 01:23:17,500
Are you going to murder me?

1304
01:23:17,708 --> 01:23:22,666
I'll die happily in your arms.
Just poke me.

1305
01:23:23,708 --> 01:23:25,125
(Screams in pain)

1306
01:23:27,041 --> 01:23:30,833
Sister.. Mahima is trying to kill me.

1307
01:23:31,416 --> 01:23:33,666
Hey blabbermouth, Mahima?
What is this blood?

1308
01:23:33,750 --> 01:23:36,708
I thought she was kidding.
But see this sister.

1309
01:23:36,958 --> 01:23:37,958
She has poked me everywhere.

1310
01:23:38,166 --> 01:23:41,083
I think she will kill our whole family.
- What are you saying?

1311
01:23:41,166 --> 01:23:42,583
See there sister..

1312
01:23:43,541 --> 01:23:44,708
What are you saying?

1313
01:23:44,750 --> 01:23:47,833
Where are you trying to hide?
I won't any of you alone.

1314
01:23:47,916 --> 01:23:50,166
I'm going to kill all of you.
- Mahima..

1315
01:23:50,250 --> 01:23:51,833
Die off.

1316
01:23:52,041 --> 01:23:53,666
Your sister would have started her action.

1317
01:24:10,875 --> 01:24:13,958
I have to kill you.
I will kill you.

1318
01:24:23,541 --> 01:24:25,375
Hey stop right there.

1319
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:29,666
Hey you.. You're done.

1320
01:24:30,166 --> 01:24:31,958
Don't kill me. Don't kill Mahima.

1321
01:24:33,416 --> 01:24:34,666
Just die.

1322
01:24:35,916 --> 01:24:37,583
Mahima, don't kill my wife.

1323
01:24:37,666 --> 01:24:38,458
I'll explain everything to you.

1324
01:24:38,541 --> 01:24:40,333
You are not a good woman.
- No, dear.

1325
01:24:40,541 --> 01:24:43,250
You have to be killed.
I will kill you!

1326
01:25:33,583 --> 01:25:37,208
You said we will run away.
Come let's leave soon.

1327
01:25:40,750 --> 01:25:43,375
Men don't have enough courage.

1328
01:26:58,416 --> 01:27:01,958
Deepak. Deepak

1329
01:27:02,166 --> 01:27:06,125
Just stop it. What are you doing?

1330
01:27:06,166 --> 01:27:07,208
Just see there.

1331
01:27:22,833 --> 01:27:25,416
Mahima has been imitating
everything she sees from movies.

1332
01:27:25,875 --> 01:27:31,208
So I'm playing movies
continuously to make her normal.

1333
01:27:47,083 --> 01:27:51,041
You can't do anything to me.

1334
01:27:53,208 --> 01:27:55,041
Anjali, get up.

1335
01:27:55,250 --> 01:27:57,666
Anjali, get up.

1336
01:27:57,916 --> 01:28:00,500
Dad! Dad!
Ask Anjali to wake up.

1337
01:28:00,750 --> 01:28:03,208
Dad! Dad!
Ask Anjali to wake up.

1338
01:28:03,458 --> 01:28:04,458
Ask Anjali to wake up.

1339
01:29:34,041 --> 01:29:39,958
Mahima... wake up Mahima.

1340
01:29:47,250 --> 01:29:50,291
Brother.. What happened?

1341
01:29:51,208 --> 01:29:52,833
Why are we all here?

1342
01:29:55,416 --> 01:29:57,416
Don't panic about whatever I say now.

1343
01:29:57,916 --> 01:30:00,541
I don't know how this all happened?

1344
01:30:01,583 --> 01:30:03,666
You have been imitating
all the characters from the movie.

1345
01:30:04,625 --> 01:30:11,750
I thought you were imitating it for fun.

1346
01:30:12,625 --> 01:30:18,833
But we never knew you began altering
yourself, like those characters.

1347
01:30:34,750 --> 01:30:37,875
Nothing jogs my memory bro.

1348
01:30:38,166 --> 01:30:39,416
I know that too.

1349
01:30:39,916 --> 01:30:41,916
Cinema theatre is our house.

1350
01:30:43,041 --> 01:30:45,291
You have been watching
movies as you grew up.

1351
01:30:46,375 --> 01:30:47,708
You're deeply psychologically
affected by this.

1352
01:30:51,625 --> 01:30:53,875
(Weeps)

1353
01:30:55,083 --> 01:30:56,291
Mahima..

1354
01:30:58,250 --> 01:30:59,250
Sister..

1355
01:30:59,666 --> 01:31:06,208
Chintu.. Chintu.. Chintu...

1356
01:31:08,208 --> 01:31:09,166
Mahima

1357
01:31:09,375 --> 01:31:10,583
Sister..

1358
01:31:10,666 --> 01:31:11,666
Don't cry, dear.

1359
01:31:11,750 --> 01:31:13,750
Please forgive me sister.
- Don't cry.

1360
01:31:16,458 --> 01:31:18,250
Cheenu forgive me.

1361
01:31:18,333 --> 01:31:19,583
It's okay, Mahima.

1362
01:31:22,833 --> 01:31:25,541
Bro I'm very sorry.

1363
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,666
For all her activities
we should have called the cops.

1364
01:31:31,375 --> 01:31:35,833
She just killed a bunch of murderers.

1365
01:31:40,458 --> 01:31:42,458
I respect the law.

1366
01:31:42,791 --> 01:31:45,625
But I love my sister more.

1367
01:31:46,375 --> 01:31:50,708
Hence, I have put her in hospital.

1368
01:31:52,541 --> 01:31:56,958
I'm waiting for her recovery.

1369
01:32:09,833 --> 01:32:15,958
Since then, I have removed
all porn movies from my theatre.

1370
01:32:41,041 --> 01:32:42,916
Let me go.
- Keep quiet.

1371
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:44,208
You did not take my advice.

1372
01:32:44,291 --> 01:32:45,916
Hey, let me go.

1373
01:32:46,166 --> 01:32:48,083
Hey!
- It is not restricted to some people.

1374
01:32:48,291 --> 01:32:49,875
Stop it, all of you.

1375
01:32:50,708 --> 01:32:53,625
They cannot stop it like this.
- You!

1376
01:32:53,708 --> 01:32:56,500
You people won't change.
- Hey!

1377
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:58,000
Hey!

1378
01:33:00,625 --> 01:33:02,041
Shock!

1379
01:33:07,750 --> 01:33:11,750
Burning Star! Burning Star!
- Who are you it?

1380
01:33:12,375 --> 01:33:14,791
Anji, only when fans like him exist..

1381
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,125
..the heros get their license!
- Hail the Burning Star!

1382
01:33:17,333 --> 01:33:20,166
Hail Burning Star! Hail Burning Star!

1383
01:33:20,333 --> 01:33:21,666
Cool down!
- Sir!

1384
01:33:21,750 --> 01:33:24,625
Normal heroes don't
give even a single photo.

1385
01:33:24,791 --> 01:33:28,333
But it seems you will feed me,
you are a real hero.

1386
01:33:28,416 --> 01:33:31,750
When I see you, my entire body burns.
- Why so?

1387
01:33:31,833 --> 01:33:34,083
It is out of respect for you.
- Tell me what you want.

1388
01:33:34,166 --> 01:33:35,916
Sir, you might have saved many lives.

1389
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:37,625
Please save my life this time.

1390
01:33:37,708 --> 01:33:39,000
I will sacrifice my life for my fans.

1391
01:33:39,083 --> 01:33:41,250
I don't want your life, I want you
to save mine. - Don't disturb him.

1392
01:33:41,333 --> 01:33:43,125
Okay, what is your problem?

1393
01:33:44,125 --> 01:33:46,916
Sir! - He is a big hero,
you shouldn't come like this.

1394
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:48,625
Please hold on.

1395
01:33:48,708 --> 01:33:51,375
Tell me what it is.
- I have a very good story with me.

1396
01:33:51,458 --> 01:33:54,166
I have a great story for the Burning Star!

1397
01:33:54,708 --> 01:33:56,958
Let me narrate it.
- The matter is..

1398
01:33:57,041 --> 01:34:01,500
Tell me. - The hero is fully drunk
and watching a movie.

1399
01:34:01,708 --> 01:34:04,666
Is it wrong for the hero to drink?
- It is not wrong.

1400
01:34:04,750 --> 01:34:05,666
We do it sometimes.

1401
01:34:05,750 --> 01:34:07,250
You do it, it is not wrong.
- Yes, tell me.

1402
01:34:07,583 --> 01:34:11,416
The hero gets fully drunk
and goes to sleep in the seat.

1403
01:34:11,666 --> 01:34:13,500
In the end the climax gets missed.

1404
01:34:13,708 --> 01:34:16,791
Is it wrong to ask
if the climax gets missed?

1405
01:34:16,875 --> 01:34:19,916
Sir, He is talking rubbish.

1406
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,875
You wait. You sit.
- Hail Burning Star!

1407
01:34:24,166 --> 01:34:27,916
What happened after that?
- The hero to the ticket into his hand.

1408
01:34:28,166 --> 01:34:31,375
They are showing a live cinema.
- A live one!

1409
01:34:31,625 --> 01:34:34,083
They are burying a dead body.
- A dead body?!

1410
01:34:34,166 --> 01:34:38,208
What happened after that, come up?
- Okay! - Not like this, I mean the story.

1411
01:34:38,291 --> 01:34:41,666
After that it is buried
and covered with soil.

1412
01:34:41,750 --> 01:34:43,250
They covered it up like that.
- I see!

1413
01:34:43,333 --> 01:34:45,875
The hero got up suddenly.
- Hey!

1414
01:34:45,958 --> 01:34:47,875
He is the gatekeeper in our theater, sir.

1415
01:34:48,208 --> 01:34:52,000
He gets drunk and tells this
story released 2 weeks ago to everyone.

1416
01:34:52,083 --> 01:34:53,750
The movie already came and went?
- Yes sir.

1417
01:34:54,166 --> 01:34:57,250
How does it help if
you tell me old stories?

1418
01:34:57,333 --> 01:35:00,583
Come with a fresh story.
- The Burning Star!

1419
01:35:01,291 --> 01:35:04,791
He blew me off!
- He is busy, go away.

1420
01:35:09,208 --> 01:35:10,375
Here, you.

1421
01:35:26,333 --> 01:35:27,500
What is the matter?

1422
01:35:34,583 --> 01:35:37,750
What is your name?
- Why?

1423
01:35:37,958 --> 01:35:40,958
I asked for general knowledge
and out of curiosity.

1424
01:35:41,666 --> 01:35:43,125
What is your name, tell me.

1425
01:35:43,958 --> 01:35:47,416
Cauvery!
- Is that why you give me water everyday?

1426
01:35:48,750 --> 01:35:51,375
Why don't you get me some biriyani?
- Biriyani!

1427
01:35:51,541 --> 01:35:54,000
I don't want to eat
that and become very strong.

1428
01:35:54,166 --> 01:35:55,750
If I don't eat for a few days..

1429
01:35:55,833 --> 01:35:57,416
..My body will become very weak.

1430
01:35:57,625 --> 01:35:59,291
The ropes will become loose.

1431
01:35:59,375 --> 01:36:01,416
The hands will automatically become free.

1432
01:36:01,500 --> 01:36:04,875
Then I will go out and
tell everyone about you.

1433
01:36:05,083 --> 01:36:09,541
That's why I warned you. - I will get
Biriyani for you from tomorrow.

1434
01:36:09,625 --> 01:36:12,375
I will tell my husband and bring it.
- Okay.

1435
01:36:13,291 --> 01:36:17,916
Hey! - You are like my sister
and don't have any false intentions.

1436
01:36:18,416 --> 01:36:20,750
Come close, I want to tell you something.

1437
01:36:21,416 --> 01:36:22,833
Your husband.
- Yes?

1438
01:36:23,041 --> 01:36:25,708
He kills the people who come
to the theatre and buries them.

1439
01:36:25,791 --> 01:36:27,916
Do you know about it?
- I know it.

1440
01:36:30,708 --> 01:36:33,500
Your entire family is full of killers.

1441
01:36:34,541 --> 01:36:36,625
Give me the balance before you go.

1442
01:36:41,208 --> 01:36:44,541
You look great. - I got this
new shirt for you, do you like it?

1443
01:36:45,166 --> 01:36:46,708
One thing got missed.
- What is it?

1444
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:48,125
I will come right back.
- Okay.

1445
01:36:49,708 --> 01:36:50,833
Just stay here.

1446
01:36:52,500 --> 01:36:54,875
Srinu, show your shirt.
- See this.

1447
01:36:55,083 --> 01:36:58,875
It has everything, buttons and pockets.
- Silly!

1448
01:36:59,541 --> 01:37:03,208
Mahima! - The shirt looks great now.
- Why did you spoil my new shirt?

1449
01:37:03,291 --> 01:37:06,708
I will spoil your dress too!
- My face!

1450
01:37:07,041 --> 01:37:10,250
Sorry!
- Why do you say that? - There!

1451
01:37:11,541 --> 01:37:13,583
Crap, I will not speak to you.

1452
01:37:19,083 --> 01:37:21,916
We must do something about him.

1453
01:37:22,208 --> 01:37:24,125
I will not spare him.
- We will do something.

1454
01:37:24,750 --> 01:37:27,041
I'm not able to enjoy the drink too, crap!

1455
01:37:28,833 --> 01:37:30,458
I'm going crazy, father-in-law!

1456
01:37:31,333 --> 01:37:33,041
We must finish him immediately.

1457
01:37:33,125 --> 01:37:37,291
In front of everyone, won't leave him.
- I will use my style on him..

1458
01:37:37,375 --> 01:37:39,791
..And put two bodies in his theater.

1459
01:38:28,833 --> 01:38:31,041
Raju my son, he's dead!

1460
01:38:31,083 --> 01:38:33,625
Are you telling the truth?

1461
01:38:35,083 --> 01:38:36,416
Not dead?

1462
01:38:36,500 --> 01:38:39,041
Why do you talk about
death early in the morning?

1463
01:38:40,291 --> 01:38:42,125
As if I am dead!

1464
01:38:42,333 --> 01:38:45,041
Father-in-law,
why did you get dressed like a corpse?

1465
01:38:45,875 --> 01:38:47,875
What is all this?

1466
01:38:51,041 --> 01:38:53,583
What's that cell?
- Hey, what's up buddy?

1467
01:38:53,833 --> 01:38:54,916
Is the phone charged?

1468
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:58,041
If you listen what I'm about to say,
your battery will get low!

1469
01:38:58,500 --> 01:39:00,666
When you see your dead
body even before you die..

1470
01:39:01,500 --> 01:39:03,166
..Do you feel scared?

1471
01:39:03,416 --> 01:39:05,250
Every person who has a family..

1472
01:39:05,458 --> 01:39:07,166
..Feels scared the same way.

1473
01:39:07,416 --> 01:39:10,333
You scare everyone by keeping
dead bodies in their homes.

1474
01:39:10,583 --> 01:39:14,041
But I made you like a
dead body for a brief time.

1475
01:39:14,333 --> 01:39:15,666
You look great in this get up.

1476
01:39:15,875 --> 01:39:18,583
Do you know why I put
cotton only in one nostril?

1477
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:22,625
If I put in the other one too,
you will be really dead.

1478
01:39:22,708 --> 01:39:26,166
What is this?
- Don't take me on.

1479
01:39:27,166 --> 01:39:29,250
He should not remain in that theatre.

1480
01:40:25,125 --> 01:40:27,291
Rahul, steady!

1481
01:40:33,375 --> 01:40:34,416
One minute!

1482
01:40:37,083 --> 01:40:39,625
Radha, tell me.

1483
01:40:40,291 --> 01:40:41,916
I am Nallakannaya speaking.

1484
01:40:42,500 --> 01:40:44,875
Money? Did you take it?

1485
01:40:45,666 --> 01:40:47,833
I will bring everything that you asked.

1486
01:40:48,708 --> 01:40:50,791
Is it okay Radha?

1487
01:40:51,583 --> 01:40:54,416
Are you wondering that I used
to take the name of Malathi earlier..

1488
01:40:54,625 --> 01:40:56,666
..but now talking to Radha?

1489
01:40:57,875 --> 01:40:59,833
I was a sincere officer before.

1490
01:41:00,083 --> 01:41:02,166
I could not get everything
that Malathi asked.

1491
01:41:02,958 --> 01:41:05,541
That's why she went
away with another officer.

1492
01:41:06,583 --> 01:41:09,458
Now I have Radha,
and need to maintain her.

1493
01:41:10,166 --> 01:41:14,166
That's why I put my sincerity
aside and started this side business.

1494
01:41:14,375 --> 01:41:16,958
You are my first client.

1495
01:41:17,375 --> 01:41:18,541
I take your leave.

1496
01:41:34,291 --> 01:41:36,916
When did you come?
- I came one day earlier than you.

1497
01:41:37,083 --> 01:41:40,166
Aren't you scared inside?
- Yes, I feel scared.

1498
01:41:40,875 --> 01:41:43,083
Crap, You became a ghost but still scared.

1499
01:41:43,458 --> 01:41:46,125
Are you not scared?
- I am very much scared.

1500
01:41:46,291 --> 01:41:48,291
Are you not ashamed?
- No.

1501
01:41:48,458 --> 01:41:50,333
What shall we do?
- Let's do one thing.

1502
01:41:50,583 --> 01:41:53,833
There are four family
members in this theatre.

1503
01:41:54,291 --> 01:41:57,708
Let's kill them and bring them along.

1504
01:41:58,083 --> 01:42:00,166
Then we will get more courage.

1505
01:42:14,583 --> 01:42:17,333
Hey, Since you mind Khakhi,
I came today in a white dress.

1506
01:42:17,416 --> 01:42:18,625
Why didn't you show the clip today?

1507
01:42:18,708 --> 01:42:21,083
Today someone else came in
that dress so we didn't show it.

1508
01:42:21,166 --> 01:42:22,833
Who is that?
- Over there.

1509
01:42:22,916 --> 01:42:26,083
He is coming this side.
- Hey, don't you have any common sense?

1510
01:42:26,291 --> 01:42:28,250
Don't you know that they won't
show the clip if you come in uniform?

1511
01:42:28,458 --> 01:42:29,500
Didn't they tell you?

1512
01:42:29,583 --> 01:42:32,083
Because of you I was
unable to see the clip today.

1513
01:42:32,166 --> 01:42:33,458
What rubbish is he talking?

1514
01:42:33,541 --> 01:42:36,375
Sir, he is forcing us to
show the clip since yesterday.

1515
01:42:36,458 --> 01:42:38,666
You say that you will
close the theatre if we do it.

1516
01:42:38,750 --> 01:42:41,500
If we don't show it, he will
not go from here. Tell us what to do.

1517
01:42:42,208 --> 01:42:43,833
He says that it can't be done, go away.

1518
01:42:44,041 --> 01:42:46,041
Who are you to tell me?
- Ah!

1519
01:42:46,125 --> 01:42:48,000
I am the SI of this area, Ravindra!

1520
01:42:48,458 --> 01:42:51,916
Sorry, sir!
please tell them to show the clip.

1521
01:42:52,083 --> 01:42:54,791
Why do you clamour for that at this age?
He says that he can't do it.

1522
01:42:54,875 --> 01:42:55,958
Don't make a scene for the small issue.

1523
01:42:56,041 --> 01:42:57,500
Is this a small issue, Sir?

1524
01:42:57,583 --> 01:43:00,291
Do you know how much trouble
one has to face for this small thing?

1525
01:43:00,375 --> 01:43:02,541
I wanted to see the movie
and got dressed neatly.

1526
01:43:02,625 --> 01:43:05,666
When I came out,
my wife gave me a carriage..

1527
01:43:05,750 --> 01:43:08,166
..And asked me where I was going.

1528
01:43:08,416 --> 01:43:12,708
I told her a lie that
I was going to office.

1529
01:43:12,750 --> 01:43:14,000
Is this a small thing for you?

1530
01:43:14,416 --> 01:43:17,250
I didn't want to miss the
show and came before everyone.

1531
01:43:17,333 --> 01:43:19,750
I took the ticket and
without anyone noticing..

1532
01:43:20,041 --> 01:43:24,041
..I lurked in the dark,
and smoked many cigarettes due to tension.

1533
01:43:24,125 --> 01:43:25,916
I did not care even for my health..

1534
01:43:26,166 --> 01:43:28,875
..After everyone went,
I went inside the theatre.

1535
01:43:28,958 --> 01:43:32,750
I sat with tension that
I might miss something.

1536
01:43:33,083 --> 01:43:35,708
Sir, at that time someone
appears on the screen.

1537
01:43:35,791 --> 01:43:39,458
The girl pulls her skirt above her knees.

1538
01:43:39,875 --> 01:43:42,291
When I feel happy that
the clip is about to start..

1539
01:43:42,625 --> 01:43:45,916
..Suddenly they pan
the camera onto the fan!

1540
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,333
I could not see it in the movie hall..

1541
01:43:48,416 --> 01:43:52,083
..And wished to see it
in my bedroom after going home.

1542
01:43:52,250 --> 01:43:55,625
I'm afraid of children at home. And
when I think of watching it on cellphone..

1543
01:43:55,875 --> 01:44:00,166
I am old and can't see the small screen.
I want to see on the big screen..

1544
01:44:00,458 --> 01:44:02,375
But they are not showing the clips!

1545
01:44:02,583 --> 01:44:04,875
Is this a small issue for you?

1546
01:44:05,041 --> 01:44:08,333
Tell me what you would do in my position.

1547
01:44:08,375 --> 01:44:11,166
What a tragedy he has!

1548
01:44:11,250 --> 01:44:14,500
Deepak, give him a show with the clip.
To ensure that no police comes..

1549
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:16,166
I will be on guard myself!
