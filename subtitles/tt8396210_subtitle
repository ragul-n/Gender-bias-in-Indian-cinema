00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Salvatore D'Aquila

2
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,500
He was the Mafia King of New York City

3
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:52,500
Having spearheaded operations from 1910 to 1926, he was succeeded by Carlo Gambino, another person of Italian descent.

4
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:59,500
It was in 1920 that Carlo's underworld presence was felt in American Mafia circles.

5
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:04,500
And his family went on to become the one of the world's first Crime Families

6
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:09,000
Carlo's gang was known to have a hand in almost every illegal deal in the area

7
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,500
They were famous for committing all kinds of crimes and leaving behind no trace

8
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:24,500
They were well-networked with officials in high positions who were given handsome rewards for joining hands with them.

9
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:30,500
In 1976 Carlo Gambino died of a cardiac arrest

10
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:40,500
Even though he is no more, the Gambino family seems to continue their illegal operations all around the world

11
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It was in the 1970's that the Kerala Police's reports began to talk of a similar crime family

12
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:04,000
The deals made by a person called Carlos and his family -- who had migrated to North Malabar -- were giving the police a hard time.

13
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Every effort put into arresting that criminal family kept resulting in failure

14
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,500
Kerala Police began referring to this family as the "Gambinos"

15
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:23,500
In due course, Carlos become the King of Kerala's Underworld Mafia. He had no competitors. The story goes on ...

16
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,000
I'm the Doctor. Where is your mother?

17
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Yeah, come on in. She is over there.

18
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
God takes back his favourite people a bit too early. Don't let the tension get to you, son.

19
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Grandma came to know of it only when the Doctor called.

20
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I have made all the necessary arrangements.

21
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:30,000
The Doctor tells me that she had been sick. Before her death ...

22
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Mummy did not want anybody to know about her illness. That's why I did not inform anyone. I'm sorry.

23
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
In a way that's better.

24
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
She left without having to trouble anyone.

25
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
You don't have to live all alone there, son, Grandma is coming

26
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You can go about your work even if you stay here.

27
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
OK

28
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Phew! These steps!

29
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Come...

30
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You've grown

31
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
When I last saw you when you were a very young boy.

32
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,500
Take your luggage.

33
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,500
Hmm

34
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Come, let's go. It's getting dark.

35
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,500
Get in

36
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
It was after Dad's sudden death

37
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
that my mummy became ill

38
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,500
For the past few years mummy and I had only each other, to call our own

39
00:11:55,500 --> 00:12:01,500
Now, after mom's death I feel really lonely.

40
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,900
How is your new place?

41
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,900
It's not bad.

42
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,400
Grandma's house is near Jawahar Colony.

43
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,400
Really? I stay near there.

44
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,000
My place is barely a a kilometre away.

45
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Oh, is it?

46
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,500
Who else lives with "mamma?"

47
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,500
My uncles. Four of them.

48
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,500
Why have you never spoken about them?

49
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:31,500
I didn't respond to that question of hers.

50
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:35,500
Even my mummy had never told me everything about them.

51
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:44,500
Maybe she did not like seeing them or being associated with them.

52
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,500
Mother was afraid of them.

53
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,500
Similarly, they also lived a life of fear.

54
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:15,500
Mother tried telling me something about them before she died

55
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:20,500
But she couldn't talk clearly with all the pain she was in.

56
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:24,500
What could it have been, I wonder.

57
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:42,500
3...4...5...yeah

58
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,500
Hey, I've already counted that.

59
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,500
Can't we just put it away, then.

60
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,500
Hmm...yeah

61
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,800
Don't sniff that thing it in like that!

62
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,800
The oldest among them is Jose uncle.

63
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,800
He's gone into hiding.

64
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:59,300
The police come looking for him, every now and then.

65
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:04,300
My other uncles too do the same business as Jose uncle.

66
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:13,300
I always see them stacking money.

67
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:18,300
But I don't really understand their business.

68
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,300
I think it's something to do with drugs.

69
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:24,300
Oh..you're up Mustafa?

70
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,300
Here

71
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,800
Do you need some juice, son?

72
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,800
No, Grandma

73
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,800
Do you like your stay here?

74
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,800
Yes, all's good.

75
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,800
The juice is good. (You should have some)

76
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,800
Thank you, I don't want it.

77
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,300
Hey... hey, come here

78
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,300
come, come, come

79
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:52,700
Ah! here he comes.

80
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,700
Haven't you finished counting as yet?

81
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,700
Yes we're done. How much do you want?

82
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,700
Put three stacks in my bag.

83
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,800
Haven't you heated the water as yet, mother?

84
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,600
Oh no! I forgot.

85
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,100
I'd told you that I had an appointment at 9.

86
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,900
Don't get angry. I'll get it done right away.

87
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,900
What is this mother?

88
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:14,900
This baby will fall sick if he bathes in cold water.

89
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:15,700
Keep it in

90
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:16,700
Get lost, man!

91
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,700
Their mother means everything to them.

92
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,700
And to her, they (mean everything to her).

93
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:26,700
Their mother supports them in all their illegal activities.

94
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:31,700
I'm trying to get used to all of this.

95
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:38,700
The most decent one among them is Aby Uncle.

96
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,700
Only Aby uncle has a family.

97
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:54,700
He is the only one who wishes to stop all these illegal activities and lead a new, clean life.

98
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:59,700
He's even talked about this to everybody other than Jose Uncle.

99
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:03,700
They all make fun of Aby uncle

100
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:08,700
However, he still hopes for a better life.

101
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:33,700
Hey, give it to her also. Be careful

102
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,700
What happened? Isn't lunch ready, yet?

103
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,700
It's getting ready

104
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,700
Just 5 minutes more...

105
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:42,700
It's been taking forever. I'm starving here.

106
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,700
Hurry up!

107
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,700
What's up?

108
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,700
Are you hungry?

109
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,700
I'm hungry, too.

110
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:12,700
We seem to have the same menu.

111
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,700
Idly in the mornings,

112
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,700
Rice in the afternoons.

113
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,700
Why isn't there anything on the table, yet?

114
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,700
Please calm down, Aby.

115
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,700
Catch!

116
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,700
Don't you have a car to play with?

117
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,700
I will buy you a Benz.

118
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:35,700
This isn't today's paper.

119
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,200
Is it in the bedroom, then?

120
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,200
No, I haven't brought it in, yet.

121
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,200
It's already noon. You couldn't have done that, by now?

122
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,700
I have been busy all day.

123
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,700
Okay, I will get it.

124
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:16,700
The police keep looking for Jose uncle. They keep an eye here, all the time.

125
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:20,700
Aby uncle usually mocks them and sends them away.

126
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:25,700
Even though it gets on their nerves, they don't make it obvious.

127
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:32,200
The person you are looking for is not here, nor does he ever come here.

128
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,200
What do you know about what our intentions are?

129
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,200
Get Lost!

130
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,200
Do you want this flower?

131
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,700
It's got a really good fragrance

132
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:42,500
You won't find such fragrant flowers anywhere around here.

133
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,000
Take it, sir.

134
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Haven't you been waiting for a long time! Take it.

135
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,500
What arrogance!

136
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,500
I'll take care of that arrogance!

137
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,500
Forget it. We'll get him another time

138
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,500
My wife and kids are in the car

139
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,500
I told them I was going to go get some vegetables.

140
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,500
You said you had something to say --

141
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Things are not the same anymore.

142
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,400
You have to increase 'my share.'

143
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,400
My answer is still the same.

144
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,400
That just won't happen.

145
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,400
Then, we are going to have some problems.

146
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,200
No way.

147
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,200
You won't share the losses of this business, would you?

148
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,200
Now, that...

149
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,100
The way things are, you're getting stuff for free.

150
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,200
That is how it is when you get easy-money.

151
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,680
Typical human behaviour!

152
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:53,180
Solomon, don't forget that I'm a police Inspector.

153
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:56,180
I've been passing on a lot of information to you from our department,

154
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:59,680
That's because we give you ten times what your department pays you in a whole year.

155
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:04,680
I can easily replace you with any of your superiors in the department.

156
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:08,480
But you've been part of our deals since my father was running the business.

157
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,980
So now don't start getting too greedy, Sudhakaran.

158
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,980
Musthafa...

159
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:21,480
Ask Jose to stay in hiding for a few more days.

160
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,480
Sound the horn.

161
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,480
Speed up...overtake them.

162
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,480
Sound the horn... We'll deal with them right away.

163
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,480
Hey stop, you buffoon.

164
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,480
How dare you drive while you are on the phone!

165
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,480
Get lost, you bugger!

166
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,480
I'm gonna...

167
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,480
They don't know who they're messing with

168
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,480
I'll teach them a lesson

169
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,480
Shit!

170
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,680
Hey, hold this out.

171
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,680
Why do we need this?

172
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,680
Just blow his brains out.

173
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,680
Shoot!

174
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,680
Get down!

175
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,680
Come out!

176
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,680
Hey, look there...

177
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,180
What is your problem?

178
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,180
Get down.

179
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,680
Come, if you've got the guts.

180
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,680
Where are you going?

181
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,680
Why are you loitering around?

182
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,080
Bang him right in his chest!

183
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,080
Bro, let's scoot!

184
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,080
Run!

185
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,080
Now do you see how powerful this is?

186
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:24,080
What do you say, Musthafa!

187
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,080
What do you want?

188
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,080
Hey, What do you want.

189
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,080
I asked my son. Not you.

190
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,080
Eat, son.

191
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:40,080
What an appetite you have!

192
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,080
What is it?

193
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,080
Why aren't you eating anything, mother?

194
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,080
Jose...

195
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,080
I wonder where he is, now.

196
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,080
He'd called me.

197
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,080
It's all because of his carelessness.

198
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,080
Nothing will happen to Jose. Don't worry.

199
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,080
Eat something, mother.

200
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,080
Hi

201
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,380
Catch it

202
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:27,380
Pass it here.

203
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:30,380
This is Salma, my classmate.

204
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:32,380
Sorry, WAS my classmate.

205
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,980
Where do you stay, Salma?

206
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:34,980
Kottaram Road.

207
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,180
This is my Grandma.

208
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:38,180
I'm Solomon.

209
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:40,180
These are my uncles.

210
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:42,180
We stay in Jawahar Colony.

211
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:44,180
Come, visit us some day.

212
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:45,680
Let's get to know each other better.

213
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,680
I will come.

214
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,680
Go,go.

215
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:15,680
We were supposed to have some good family-time, today.

216
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,180
But this guy has been sniffing ever since he got here.

217
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:18,680
Can't you stop this?

218
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:21,680
You are the only one with a family of your own.

219
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,680
You all had (families), too.

220
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,680
But you ruined it all.

221
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,180
Don't get me started...

222
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:28,180
Aby, let it be.

223
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:31,180
Or he will use it as an excuse to take in more drugs

224
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:34,180
He's just looking for reasons (to do so).

225
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:36,180
We make a living from the money we get from this.

226
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:38,180
Let's not forget that.

227
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:40,180
His lousy advice!

228
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:46,180
One day we will have to stop all of this.

229
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:49,180
That day you won't be able to stop even if you want to.

230
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:51,180
You're right.

231
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:53,180
I'm telling you, too.

232
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:58,180
Musthafa, bring me some water

233
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:16,180
What happened Musthafa?

234
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:23,180
Do you know who I am?

235
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,180
Aren't you Jose uncle?

236
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:29,180
Yes

237
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:31,180
Musthafa...

238
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:37,180
Go.

239
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:55,180
How much longer will you have to live hidden like this?

240
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:57,180
It's not a simple crime.

241
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:59,180
You are considered a traitor now.

242
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:01,680
He won't even get bail.

243
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:04,680
What evidence do they have?

244
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:07,180
The weapons that were seized from my vehicle?

245
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,180
Isn't that enough? Aren't weapons considered evidence?

246
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:12,180
It's true that I used that car,

247
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:14,180
Bu the RC (of that car) is not in my name.

248
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:18,680
The kids are falling asleep, let's go

249
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,680
Don't start nagging while we're are in the middle a serious conversation

250
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,680
They will sleep over there, don't worry.

251
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,680
Brother...brother...police!

252
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,680
Police? Where?

253
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,680
Close the door immediately!

254
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,680
Brother, get away from here!

255
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,980
Solomon, Where?

256
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:33,980
Fooled You!

257
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,980
You got me all tensed up

258
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:12,980
We have to buy some groceries.

259
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:14,980
What?

260
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,980
We have to do some grocery shopping.

261
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,980
We're running out of them.

262
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,980
I have to go to the supermarket, anyway.

263
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,980
Make a list and hand it over to me.

264
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,980
Hurry. I'll be waiting.

265
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:28,480
By the way, why were you going to the supermarket?

266
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:31,980
Just to meet brother Jose.

267
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:36,580
What is he doing in the supermarket if he supposed to be in hiding?

268
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,580
What are you guys upto?

269
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:40,580
Nothing much. It's just a small deal

270
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:43,580
Why are you making it small? Make a big one, instead.

271
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,580
Haven't I told you not to interfere in these matters

272
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:48,580
Don't you remember -- we have kids.

273
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:50,580
I'm interfering because...

274
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:53,080
What am I supposed to say when they ask me what their father does for a living?

275
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,080
That he is a drug dealer?

276
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:57,680
Didn't you know all about this from the very beginning?

277
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,680
Haven't I told you everything about my business?

278
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:04,680
You did. But back then, I wasn't mature enough to understand these things.

279
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:07,680
The police visit our house almost everyday looking for Jose.

280
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,680
Why do they have to come here?

281
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,680
The kids are getting scared, too.

282
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:15,680
Aby, we can work hard together to lead a decent life.

283
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,680
Or else...

284
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,680
Be patient for a little longer, Daisy.

285
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,680
I'm really fed up.

286
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:28,680
I know. This is like a whirlpool

287
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:32,180
I want to get out of this, too.

288
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:36,180
I want to end all of this before our kids start realizing things.

289
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:39,180
You go now. I have work to do.

290
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:44,180
You send me the list on Whatsapp.

291
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:54,180
I have to sneak in and out of places to get meet you

292
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:56,180
Can't we put an end to all this?

293
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:58,180
What are you going do instead?

294
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:02,180
We can invest in the Share Market, maybe?

295
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,980
Don't I need to have computer skills for that?

296
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,980
I don't know anything about computers.

297
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,980
Or we can start some other business.

298
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,980
Why do we need to start some other business (when we have this)?

299
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:14,480
Hasn't Dad already established a good business for us?

300
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,480
The "medicine" Business?

301
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,480
It's called Drug Dealing.

302
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:21,980
Drugs are also medicines.

303
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:23,980
This will do for now

304
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:26,480
Fine. I was only hoping we could clean up our act.

305
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,480
Hey --

306
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,480
Any common man do what you've been suggesting.

307
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,480
But to be a Gambino --

308
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,480
That's not everyone's cup of tea

309
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,480
You need to have guts!.

310
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,280
Forget it, if you're not interested.

311
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,280
I'm going shopping.

312
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,280
I can drop you.

313
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,280
Hey

314
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:29,580
You could've seen him if you had come 5 minutes earlier.

315
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:31,580
That won't be necessary.

316
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:34,080
We can make do with you.

317
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:36,080
Let me know when you decide.

318
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,080
Okay, I have to go now.

319
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,080
Did you tell her?

320
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,080
Okay

321
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,080
I will call you later

322
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,080
Does she know?

323
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,080
No, I haven't told her yet.

324
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,080
What is this Solomon?

325
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:19,080
This is all fate.

326
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,080
What fate are you talking about?

327
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:37,080
Son,

328
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:39,080
Solomon ...

329
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,080
Solomon!

330
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:47,080
What are you doing?

331
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,580
Where is Mother?

332
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,580
She went to big brother's house.

333
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:47,680
Aren't you ashamed to drink beer like girls?

334
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,380
I'll do what I like

335
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:51,380
Okay.

336
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:56,880
I have been wanting to ask you something for a while now

337
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,880
What is it?

338
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,180
Do you have a case going on?

339
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:04,680
Stop beating around the bush and tell me what it is.

340
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,680
Don't you have a girlfriend?

341
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,880
No.

342
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,880
Why not?

343
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,680
I don't have the time for relationships.

344
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,480
Then, how do you plan to pass your time?

345
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,480
By drinking beer?

346
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,480
Or by drugging yourself?

347
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,480
Hey

348
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:37,480
It's been a week since Aby's death.

349
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,480
For him,

350
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:44,980
and for his soul,

351
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:48,180
have we done anything at all?

352
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:52,180
No!

353
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:54,180
Alex.

354
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:56,180
Shouldn't we do something for Alex?

355
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:58,180
Yes, we should!

356
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,180
Finish your bath quickly and come

357
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:18,180
I need to go somewhere.

358
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:19,680
I need a car.

359
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,680
We have a car here.

360
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,680
Hey, you don't tell me what to do.

361
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,680
I'll tell you, you just obey.

362
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:28,180
There will be abandoned cars on road.

363
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:31,680
Bring me one of them. And bring it before 11 pm.

364
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,180
How can I do all this?

365
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:35,680
You can.

366
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,680
This is also an opportunity for you.

367
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:38,680
You will get more opportunities like this,

368
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,680
if you can prove yourself.

369
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,680
This is how you learn new things.

370
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,680
So, I'll see you at sharp 11 pm,

371
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,680
Ok?

372
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,680
His bloody drugs! We have important things to do!

373
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:58,680
I'm gonna thrash you.

374
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,680
Take that too.

375
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:05,680
Where is the car?

376
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,680
It is parked behind the house.

377
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:09,480
We will be back soon.

378
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,480
If anyone calls,

379
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:13,480
Tell them we all are right here

380
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:15,480
Here.

381
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:17,480
If they ask for us again, tell them that we are in the toilet.

382
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,480
Let's go.

383
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,480
Come.

384
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:34,480
There is a suspicious car on Thondayadu Bypass Road.

385
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:37,480
Can you please tell us the exact location.

386
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,480
It is somewhere on the Thondayadu Bypass Road

387
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,480
We are on our way there.

388
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,480
Hey

389
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,980
You messed with the Gambinos, you bastard!

390
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:14,980
What happened?

391
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:16,680
Why are you alone?

392
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:18,180
Where are the others?

393
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:20,180
Just shut up and go.

394
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:23,180
Get lost!

395
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:34,180
Phone ringing

396
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:40,180
Phone ringing

397
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:44,180
Phone ringing

398
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:11,980
Hey Musthafa

399
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:13,980
I like your hairstyle.

400
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:15,980
At what salon did you get it cut?

401
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:18,480
It's not from a salon.

402
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,480
Did you do it yourself?

403
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,480
A friend of mine did it.

404
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,780
Friend? As in girlfriend?

405
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:27,780
What was her name?

406
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:29,780
I forget

407
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:30,780
Salma

408
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:32,780
Sal...ah

409
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:35,380
It's hard to believe she cuts so well

410
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:39,380
Does she cut for others too?

411
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:43,380
See this hair?

412
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:46,380
I'd like to make it more stylish.

413
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:49,080
She will cut for me if you ask her to.

414
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:51,080
Won't you ask her?

415
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:53,080
After all,

416
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:55,080
I am your Uncle

417
00:46:58,080 --> 00:46:59,880
Hey, Mustafa...

418
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:24,680
What is your name?

419
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:25,680
Musthafa

420
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:31,680
I need to clarify a few things with you regarding a murder case

421
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:33,680
Okay

422
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:35,180
Jose..Alex..

423
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:36,880
Then there's one more person, Who's that?

424
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:37,380
Solomon

425
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:39,380
Yeah, Solomon

426
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:40,380
He's the one who got away.

427
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:42,380
The police is looking for him

428
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:44,380
What is your full name?

429
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:45,380
Mustafa Ahmed

430
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:46,880
And 'Ahmed' is your Father

431
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:47,880
Yes

432
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:49,880
What is your relationship with these people?

433
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:51,880
..this family?

434
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:53,880
They are my mother's family

435
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:55,880
So Jose and Alex?

436
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:56,880
They are my mothers siblings.

437
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,380
What is your mothers name?

438
00:48:58,380 --> 00:48:59,580
Aleena Carlos.

439
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:01,080
How is your mother's relationship with them?

440
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:03,080
Does she visit often?

441
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:04,080
No.

442
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:06,580
Even I had no connection with them till mother's death.

443
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:07,580
Has it been long since your mother's death?

444
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:09,580
She passed away last month.

445
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:11,580
She had cancer.

446
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:13,580
Where were you yesterday?

447
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:15,080
At Jose uncle's house.

448
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:17,080
Where did you say they had gone yesterday night?

449
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:18,080
I never said that they did.

450
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,080
Then tell me now.

451
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:21,080
Where did they go?

452
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:22,780
They were at home.

453
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:23,780
Okay.

454
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:26,280
How was your relationship with this Aby, who died in a police encounter.

455
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:27,280
He was very friendly.

456
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,480
Everyone liked him.

457
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,480
What about the other uncles?

458
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:33,980
They are troublemakers, aren't they?

459
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:34,980
That's not what I meant.

460
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:36,980
Aby uncle was a decent guy.

461
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:38,980
Where were you at the time of Aby's death?

462
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:40,980
I was at home with grandmother.

463
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:43,980
How did your uncles react to the news of his death?

464
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:44,980
I'm not sure I understand you.

465
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:46,980
He was shot, right?

466
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:48,980
How did your uncles react to that?

467
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:50,980
They all were very depressed

468
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:56,180
Didn't they want to take revenge on whoever killed Aby?

469
00:49:56,180 --> 00:49:58,180
Anyone would react that way, wouldn't they?

470
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:01,680
Only Solomon Uncle created a ruckus.

471
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:05,280
So it must be this Solomon who planned the revenge, right?

472
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:06,280
No. sir.

473
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:08,280
He did create a ruckus.

474
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:10,280
And then he cried a lot.

475
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:12,280
I forgot to introduce myself.

476
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:14,580
I'm Crime Branch D.Y.S.P Pradeep Kumar.

477
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:17,580
He is North C.I, Alex Paul.

478
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:21,580
Have you had anything to eat, Musthafa?

479
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:22,580
Yes sir

480
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:24,580
Ok, we will call you when we need you again.

481
00:50:24,580 --> 00:50:26,580
We might have to meet again

482
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:40,080
My being at Aby's house at the time, was the reason for all of this.

483
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:43,280
None of this would've happened if I were home.

484
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:46,280
They were digging their own graves by killing Aby.

485
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:50,280
Couldn't you have said a word about this before you set off?

486
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:54,780
What else were we supposed to do to those who killed Aby?

487
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:57,780
Weren't we supposed to kill those bastards?

488
00:50:57,780 --> 00:51:00,280
You tell me. Shouldn't we have done that?

489
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:03,280
He is my Son.

490
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:07,080
He's the one I pampered the most.

491
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:09,080
He came from my womb.

492
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:16,080
So, I should be the one having a grudge against his murderers. A much bigger grudge than any of you.

493
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:18,080
But

494
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:20,080
We are not safe.

495
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:24,080
Jose ...

496
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:26,580
The police already have you on watch.

497
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:30,080
Now they will use this as an excuse to raid the entire house.

498
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:34,080
When your father was alive

499
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:37,080
not a soul had the guts to come near our house.

500
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:43,080
Now his kids...

501
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:46,880
Are living in fear of the cops.

502
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,880
You should be able to strike fear in your enemies.

503
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,880
Like your father Carlos, did.

504
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:52,880
And that is why

505
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:55,880
they called him 'Gambino'

506
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:58,880
Even that name is tarnished, now.

507
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:00,880
Phone ringing

508
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,880
Tell me

509
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:06,880
I am inside

510
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:08,880
Never mind. I will come there.

511
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:11,180
Mother, Solomon is standing outside.

512
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:13,180
I will go and get him.

513
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:19,180
Jose

514
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:22,180
You should go and meet that psychiatrist.

515
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:24,180
And continue your medication.

516
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:26,180
What?

517
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:34,180
Come

518
00:52:40,180 --> 00:52:41,180
Solomon,

519
00:52:41,180 --> 00:52:43,380
I spoke to the lawyer.

520
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:49,380
That won't work, mother.

521
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:52,880
We can then get you out on bail, son.

522
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:54,880
This is not an ordinary case.

523
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,880
It is murder of policemen.

524
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:58,880
They won't go easy on you.

525
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,880
You know what will happen if they catch you.

526
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:04,880
You first get an anticipatory bail

527
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:07,880
I cannot go and surrender.

528
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:11,880
But

529
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:13,880
Where is he?

530
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:15,380
That's right --

531
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:17,380
Alex, where is Musthafa?

532
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:28,980
Do you know cooking?

533
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:30,980
Yes. Sort of

534
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:32,980
I used to help mummy, at times.

535
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:35,780
She was a great cook.

536
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:38,280
And my father was a big time foodie.

537
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:40,280
He loved the fish curry she made.

538
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:43,780
You too have been chatting?

539
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:47,780
Somebody here has been so hungry that he's begun blabbering. Come, let's eat.

540
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:07,780
Salma tells me that you have quit your education and have started looking for a job.

541
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:09,780
Your education is important.

542
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:11,780
Mamma has also been saying that.

543
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:13,780
Yeah

544
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:20,780
The vehicle used for the killing of the cops on Thondayadu Bypass Road seems to be a stolen one.

545
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:25,780
Kerala police are also searching for the car jackers who might have links to this case.

546
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:31,780
Senior police officers tell the media that the culprits will be found at any cost.

547
00:54:31,780 --> 00:54:38,780
Family members of the deceased cops will be getting a compensation amount of Rs 10 lakh from the government.

548
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:45,780
How can I help you?

549
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:47,080
Is Musthafa here?

550
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:48,580
He is inside.

551
00:54:48,580 --> 00:54:50,580
Tell him Alex has come.

552
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:54,580
Musthafa,

553
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:56,580
A person named Alex has come to see you

554
00:55:04,580 --> 00:55:06,580
Why are you here?

555
00:55:06,580 --> 00:55:08,580
Hurry up. Let's go.

556
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:02,280
What did they ask you at the police station?

557
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:04,280
Will you be able to recall and tell us everything?

558
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:06,280
Don't leave anything out.

559
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:08,280
Not even a word.

560
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:12,280
They try to trap you using what you said

561
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:14,280
So tell me everything -- word by word.

562
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:16,980
They did not ask too many questions.

563
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:22,380
And what did you tell them?

564
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:24,380
Tell me all about it.

565
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:26,380
They asked me my name.

566
00:56:27,380 --> 00:56:29,880
The police tend to re-phrase questions.

567
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:32,880
And ask you things from different angles.

568
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:34,880
We should be careful not to spill the beans.

569
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:36,880
It is only natural that they ask questions.

570
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:38,880
They are doing their duty.

571
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:41,380
We should keep our mouths shut. That is what's ideal for us.

572
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:43,380
Especially in your case.

573
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:45,880
I hope you haven't given them any clues.

574
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:55,880
What was her name again?

575
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:57,880
Whose?

576
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:00,380
The girl you keep hanging out with...

577
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:02,380
Salma

578
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:04,880
Did you share anything with her?

579
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:06,880
No.

580
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,880
Are you sure?

581
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:10,880
I haven't said anything

582
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:12,880
I am sure.

583
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:17,380
We should always be careful while sharing secrets with women.

584
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:20,880
They tend to tell it to others.

585
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:23,880
Especially with the police

586
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:25,880
they are sure to blurt it all out.

587
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:29,380
You don't mind not telling her, do you?

588
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:32,380
I haven't said anything till now.

589
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:36,380
It would be better for both if you do not see each other anymore

590
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:39,680
You shouldn't see that girl again

591
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:41,680
Isn't that better?

592
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:42,680
Let all of this get sorted out

593
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:44,680
You don't have to worry

594
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:46,680
He will not see her again

595
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:48,680
Right, son?

596
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:12,680
Fuel for 500 Rupees.

597
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:22,680
Don't make noise and give away your location Solomon. Just Stop.

598
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:30,180
This is the real deal. This is what I have been looking for.

599
00:59:37,180 --> 00:59:40,480
I have stopped dealing with weapons.

600
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:43,280
Your father Carlos was the one who brought me into this field.

601
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:45,080
So what? You did make a fortune out of it, didn't you?

602
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:47,080
That is why I agreed to do this.

603
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:50,680
This weapons business is a risky one, Solomon.

604
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:53,180
Didn't you get hefty payments for the risk you took?

605
00:59:53,180 --> 00:59:56,080
Just arrange for me to stay here for 2 days.

606
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:57,580
I forgot to tell you something...

607
00:59:57,580 --> 01:00:00,380
Who asked you to come here, now?

608
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:03,380
2 Men had come here yesterday when you were out.

609
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:05,680
Who were they?

610
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:06,180
I don't know

611
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:08,780
They asked if there were any other people living here.

612
01:00:08,780 --> 01:00:09,780
I said No.

613
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:10,780
Is there a problem?

614
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:11,780
Was it the cops?

615
01:00:11,780 --> 01:00:14,480
I'm not sure. They looked that way though.

616
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:15,780
Might it have been the police?

617
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:17,480
How am I supposed to know whether it was the cops or not?

618
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:18,480
Who turned on this phone?

619
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:19,580
Who would want to do that, now?

620
01:00:19,580 --> 01:00:21,080
I had turned it off

621
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:23,080
The police can track and find me if the phone is turned on.

622
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:24,080
Shit!

623
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:25,580
They must be on their way here.

624
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:27,580
I swear I didn't do it, Solomon.

625
01:00:27,580 --> 01:00:29,580
Do you have an extra sim card?

626
01:00:29,580 --> 01:00:31,080
I don't even have a mobile phone.

627
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:32,780
Useless!

628
01:00:32,780 --> 01:00:34,780
Solomon,

629
01:03:12,780 --> 01:03:14,780
Don't give up, son

630
01:03:18,780 --> 01:03:22,280
*died in a police encounter last week*

631
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:23,580
Geethu, turn up the volume

632
01:03:23,580 --> 01:03:28,580
This happened in between an ongoing murder investigation where the police were looking for Solomon, one of the suspects.

633
01:03:28,580 --> 01:03:33,780
Solomon died in an encounter with Crime Branch D.Y.S.P Pradeep Kumar and his team.

634
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:37,780
Sir, the Mafia seems to have grown stronger in the city in recent times.

635
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:40,280
Even with the police presence and judicial system we have in place.

636
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:42,280
You are right. There has been a spike in such crimes in the city.

637
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:44,280
Now the responsibility is on my shoulders.

638
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:46,280
Such incidents will not happen again.

639
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:50,280
We've started making movements against them.

640
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:52,280
You will hear more about it in the next few days.

641
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:06,280
Why is this happening to my kids?

642
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:12,280
Jesus, are you keeping me alive in order to see all of this?

643
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:15,280
Didn't we ask him to surrender?

644
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:17,280
But he just wouldn't listen.

645
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:19,280
Now see what's happened.

646
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:21,780
Why are you blaming him alone?

647
01:04:21,780 --> 01:04:23,780
So, I am the culprit now?

648
01:04:23,780 --> 01:04:25,780
Did I ask him to go into hiding?

649
01:04:25,780 --> 01:04:27,780
You speak as if it is all my fault.

650
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:29,780
Of course

651
01:04:29,780 --> 01:04:32,280
It was your impatience that lead to this.

652
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:35,080
What do you mean by that?

653
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:40,080
Have you forgotten all about the debt that dad had left us with when he died?

654
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:42,580
We shouldn't forget our past.

655
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:46,580
I single-handedly brought the family into the position we are in, now.

656
01:04:46,580 --> 01:04:48,580
What position are you talking about?

657
01:04:48,580 --> 01:04:54,580
Having to see my children's blood-soaked bodies?

658
01:04:54,580 --> 01:04:56,580
Is that the position you are talking about?

659
01:04:56,580 --> 01:04:58,080
Is that the guts you were talking about?

660
01:04:58,080 --> 01:05:00,080
They brought that upon themselves.

661
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:05,080
You and your kids lived happily till now, haven't you all?

662
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:07,580
All this time, there have been no words of appreciation.

663
01:05:07,580 --> 01:05:09,580
Now all the blame is mine.

664
01:05:09,580 --> 01:05:12,280
You should be thankful.

665
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:16,280
What should I be thankful for? Tell me...

666
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:18,780
For giving birth to you?

667
01:05:18,780 --> 01:05:22,780
Let's not get started on how you brought us up.

668
01:05:24,780 --> 01:05:26,280
Get out.

669
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:28,280
You are a psycho.

670
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:30,280
You...you

671
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:31,780
You are the one who killed my kids.

672
01:05:31,780 --> 01:05:33,280
Hey don't talk nonsense.

673
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:34,980
Am I the one who killed them?

674
01:05:34,980 --> 01:05:37,480
Don't blame me for their mistakes

675
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:38,480
Enough!

676
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:41,480
Don't say another word.

677
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:43,480
You old fag...

678
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:45,480
Leave Grandma alone.

679
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:47,480
What?

680
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:49,480
Don't hurt Grandma.

681
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:51,480
Hey, who are you to say that?

682
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:53,280
Jose leave him alone.

683
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:54,280
Who the hell are you?

684
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:56,280
Jose let go. Don't say anything.

685
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:57,280
Let me go.

686
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:58,780
Listen to me, Jose.

687
01:05:58,780 --> 01:05:59,780
Who the hell are you?

688
01:05:59,780 --> 01:06:01,780
No Jose, don't hurt him.

689
01:06:01,780 --> 01:06:03,780
Stop there.

690
01:06:03,780 --> 01:06:05,780
Stop!

691
01:06:14,780 --> 01:06:16,780
What is the issue?

692
01:06:19,780 --> 01:06:22,780
Hey it's nothing. We were just playing around.

693
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:26,780
Musthafa is everything ok?

694
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:30,280
He is okay. Aren't you?

695
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:34,280
I'll be taking him with me.

696
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:36,580
I've got to ask him a few things.

697
01:06:36,580 --> 01:06:41,580
Sir, if he doesn't co-operate with you, please let me know.

698
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:43,580
I will set him straight.

699
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:49,180
Whatever you want to ask him, you can ask me. I will give you all the answers.

700
01:06:49,180 --> 01:06:50,680
That will not be necessary.

701
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:54,180
I will definitely ask you if the need ever arises.

702
01:06:55,180 --> 01:07:02,180
I will be able to give you some crucial information regarding the police murders.

703
01:07:02,180 --> 01:07:05,180
I am ready to help you in any way possible.

704
01:07:07,180 --> 01:07:09,180
Right now I just need him.

705
01:07:09,180 --> 01:07:11,180
Musthafa

706
01:07:12,180 --> 01:07:13,180
Go

707
01:07:14,180 --> 01:07:16,180
I will send the lawyer along with you.

708
01:07:16,180 --> 01:07:18,180
Come

709
01:07:33,180 --> 01:07:38,680
I will pray that this case be solved as soon as possible.

710
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:42,680
Everything will be settled quickly if your prayers are with us.

711
01:07:54,680 --> 01:07:56,680
They are the police.

712
01:07:57,680 --> 01:07:59,680
They will try to brainwash you; they have their ways.

713
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:02,680
Don't give them anything.

714
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:05,680
They are doing their duty.

715
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:07,680
That's all.

716
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:14,180
You are my blood relation.

717
01:08:15,180 --> 01:08:19,180
Our issues are just temporary.

718
01:08:26,180 --> 01:08:31,680
Your mother was a favorite of mine.

719
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:34,180
And you are my Aleena's Son

720
01:08:35,180 --> 01:08:40,180
I'll be there for you if you ever need me.

721
01:08:40,180 --> 01:08:42,180
Even if it is a life or death situation.

722
01:08:43,180 --> 01:08:48,180
I'm ready to spend any amount of money for you, because

723
01:08:48,180 --> 01:08:50,180
You are my blood.

724
01:08:51,180 --> 01:08:56,180
It is my duty to protect you.

725
01:08:56,180 --> 01:08:58,180
Hey

726
01:09:10,180 --> 01:09:13,180
I have already asked you this once, 
I'll repeat myself once more.

727
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:24,980
They were talking about the funeral rites.

728
01:09:24,980 --> 01:09:26,980
Did they get very emotional and say anything out of the ordinary?

729
01:09:26,980 --> 01:09:31,980
It's normal for any person to get emotional when their brother dies.

730
01:09:34,980 --> 01:09:36,980
Why are you silent, Mustafa?

731
01:09:36,980 --> 01:09:40,980
Did the lawyer ask you not to say anything?

732
01:09:40,980 --> 01:09:42,980
I only need a statement from you.

733
01:09:42,980 --> 01:09:47,980
We are looking for answers that could help solve this case, do you understand?

734
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:51,480
He is not a small kid, He understands.

735
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:54,980
Firstly, your understanding of things itself is incorrect.

736
01:09:54,980 --> 01:09:58,480
Then how can he give a statement that will help you.

737
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:00,280
And if it is evidence that you want

738
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:04,280
then he or someone else will have to make false evidence for you.

739
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:08,280
Such false evidences and statements won't hold up in court.

740
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:10,280
Am I not right?

741
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:15,280
We'll have to meet again

742
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:19,280
Come.

743
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:24,280
That D.Y.S.P is a tough guy.

744
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:26,280
As of now, they haven't got anything from Mustafa.

745
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:28,280
But this is not forever.

746
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:31,780
They know how to make him talk if they manage to get hold of him alone.

747
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:35,080
You did something very foolish.

748
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:40,080
You shouldn't have sent an amateur like him to steal the vehicle.

749
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:45,080
If he admits to stealing the car, then we will be finished.

750
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:48,880
Why did you send him to steal that car?

751
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:50,880
Why?

752
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:52,680
I had asked Alex to do it

753
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:53,680
Nobody told me anything.

754
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:55,680
I had told you to do it first.

755
01:10:55,680 --> 01:10:58,180
Jose, you had told him to do it.

756
01:10:58,180 --> 01:11:00,180
Now don't blame me when there is an issue.

757
01:11:00,180 --> 01:11:02,180
This is his problem.

758
01:11:02,180 --> 01:11:04,180
You could've stolen that vehicle.

759
01:11:04,180 --> 01:11:06,180
You didn't listen to me and made him steal the vehicle.

760
01:11:06,180 --> 01:11:07,380
That lead to all these issues

761
01:11:07,380 --> 01:11:08,080
I made him do it?

762
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:09,080
Yeah Alex, that is the cause of all of this.

763
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:09,980
What are you saying, Jose?

764
01:11:09,980 --> 01:11:12,780
You should've gone and stolen the vehicle but you never listen. That is the problem.

765
01:11:12,780 --> 01:11:14,780
Stop. Stop. Stop.

766
01:11:14,780 --> 01:11:16,780
I didn't call you both here to argue.

767
01:11:16,780 --> 01:11:17,780
Tell that to him.

768
01:11:17,780 --> 01:11:18,780
Hey

769
01:11:18,780 --> 01:11:20,780
Now you understand, right?

770
01:11:21,780 --> 01:11:24,280
Alex, no matter who did it, it was a stupid mistake.

771
01:11:25,980 --> 01:11:27,980
What can we do now?

772
01:11:29,980 --> 01:11:31,980
Musthafa!

773
01:11:31,980 --> 01:11:33,980
The whole case now lies with him.

774
01:11:33,980 --> 01:11:35,980
We should always keep an eye on him.

775
01:11:35,980 --> 01:11:37,980
Always. Do you understand?

776
01:11:37,980 --> 01:11:39,980
Yes.

777
01:11:39,980 --> 01:11:41,980
Alex,

778
01:11:41,980 --> 01:11:42,980
Where would he be, now?

779
01:11:42,980 --> 01:11:44,980
He is always at that girl's house.

780
01:11:44,980 --> 01:11:47,180
Perfect! I had told you guys that.

781
01:11:47,180 --> 01:11:49,180
To him, as well as you.

782
01:11:49,180 --> 01:11:52,180
He will never see her again!

783
01:12:04,180 --> 01:12:06,180
What is it?

784
01:12:06,180 --> 01:12:07,180
Is Mustafa here?

785
01:12:07,180 --> 01:12:07,680
Yes he is.

786
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:08,680
Can you please call him?

787
01:12:08,680 --> 01:12:10,680
Musthafa...

788
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:30,680
Why did you come?

789
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:34,080
Didn't we tell you to never come here? And not to meet her ever again?

790
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:36,080
What wrong with my meeting her?

791
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:38,080
You can meet her. But after this issue is resolved.

792
01:12:39,380 --> 01:12:41,080
Haven't we told you?

793
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:42,780
What is the connection between this and the case?

794
01:12:42,780 --> 01:12:43,780
I don't understand.

795
01:12:43,780 --> 01:12:45,580
You only need to understand this much for now.

796
01:12:45,580 --> 01:12:47,580
Have you forgotten what the lawyer said?

797
01:12:47,580 --> 01:12:50,280
He doesn't have any right to interfere in my personal matters.

798
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:53,780
I don't know anything about that but this is something that affects our family.

799
01:12:53,780 --> 01:12:55,780
It's better that you do as you are asked to.

800
01:12:57,080 --> 01:12:59,080
You've got a call.

801
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:00,080
Say I'm busy.

802
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:02,080
They said it's important.

803
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:03,380
Salma, just go inside.

804
01:13:03,380 --> 01:13:05,380
Can't you see that we are discussing something here.

805
01:13:05,380 --> 01:13:07,380
What a time for a call!

806
01:13:07,380 --> 01:13:09,380
Come, let's go.

807
01:13:10,380 --> 01:13:12,380
There should be no contact with her henceforth.

808
01:13:12,380 --> 01:13:13,580
This is what I can't understand...

809
01:13:13,580 --> 01:13:15,580
Why should I keep my life on hold?

810
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:19,380
I have nothing to do with this case.

811
01:13:19,380 --> 01:13:21,380
This is your problem.

812
01:13:22,380 --> 01:13:24,880
So please don't drag me into this.

813
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:26,880
Please leave.

814
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:28,880
I will go.

815
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:31,880
If you think we are the only ones who will be affected by this case.

816
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:32,880
You are wrong.

817
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:34,880
You are the one who stole the car that night.

818
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:36,880
The murder took place inside that car.

819
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:39,880
The only evidence that the police has in this case, is that car.

820
01:13:41,380 --> 01:13:43,380
So even you are damned.

821
01:13:43,380 --> 01:13:45,380
There's no doubt about that.

822
01:13:45,380 --> 01:13:47,380
If you love her sincerely

823
01:13:47,380 --> 01:13:49,880
stay away from her until this issue is solved.

824
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:51,880
Or else

825
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:53,880
she will also be trapped in all of this.

826
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:56,880
One more thing --

827
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:58,880
None of your plans will work.

828
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:03,880
You have tonight to think again, and make you decisions regarding her.

829
01:14:25,880 --> 01:14:26,880
Salma,

830
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:29,380
Why aren't you responding?

831
01:14:29,380 --> 01:14:33,380
If you want me to respond to us never meeting again, then I have nothing to say about that.

832
01:14:33,380 --> 01:14:35,880
Why don't you tell me why you're doing this?

833
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:37,880
That is our family matter.

834
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:42,880
How did this family matter suddenly pop up out of nowhere?

835
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:46,880
Or did you make it all up just to get rid of me?

836
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:48,880
It's just for a while, I promise.

837
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:50,880
Then we will meet again

838
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:55,380
Let me discuss this with Mamma. Till then please do as I say.

839
01:14:55,380 --> 01:14:58,380
Since you have already made up your mind,

840
01:14:58,380 --> 01:15:00,380
I have nothing to say

841
01:15:00,380 --> 01:15:02,380
I'm leaving.

842
01:15:03,380 --> 01:15:07,880
By the way, I will also have to think about this decision to not meet each other.

843
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:09,880
Salma, please sit down.

844
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:11,880
Please sit

845
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:18,580
Salma, this is what is best for you.

846
01:15:18,580 --> 01:15:21,580
Best for me? I don't understand.

847
01:15:21,580 --> 01:15:23,580
Tell me what it is.

848
01:15:23,580 --> 01:15:25,580
What? Now you have nothing to say?

849
01:15:27,580 --> 01:15:29,580
You are not what I thought you were.

850
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:33,080
You will pay for toying with my feelings.

851
01:15:33,080 --> 01:15:35,080
Just wait and see.

852
01:15:38,780 --> 01:15:40,780
What is it? What's the problem?

853
01:15:42,780 --> 01:15:44,780
Girlfriend?

854
01:15:44,780 --> 01:15:46,780
No need to tell if it's a secret.

855
01:15:47,580 --> 01:15:49,580
You have to come with me now.

856
01:15:49,580 --> 01:15:51,580
Please leave me alone.

857
01:15:51,580 --> 01:15:53,580
The vehicle is downstairs.

858
01:15:53,580 --> 01:15:55,580
Come and get in.

859
01:15:55,580 --> 01:15:58,080
I just told you I can't come in this situation.

860
01:15:58,080 --> 01:16:02,080
Whatever the situation you might be, remember this is a call from the Crime Branch D.Y.S.P.

861
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:04,080
What will you do if I don't come?

862
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:06,080
I'll force you into the vehicle. That's what I usually do.

863
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:11,080
And by your look I know that you are the obedient type.

864
01:16:11,080 --> 01:16:12,580
If you try to disobey.

865
01:16:12,580 --> 01:16:17,580
We will have to bring your girlfriend into the investigation.

866
01:16:17,580 --> 01:16:19,580
That's how the police work.

867
01:16:19,580 --> 01:16:22,580
So are you coming or do you want to trouble her too?

868
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:25,580
I'll come.

869
01:16:25,580 --> 01:16:27,580
Then come

870
01:17:37,580 --> 01:17:39,580
Is Musthafa home?

871
01:17:39,580 --> 01:17:41,580
What is it?

872
01:17:41,580 --> 01:17:43,580
I just wanted to meet him. Can you please call him?

873
01:17:43,580 --> 01:17:45,180
Yeah

874
01:17:45,180 --> 01:17:47,180
Come inside.

875
01:17:59,180 --> 01:18:01,180
Be seated.

876
01:18:01,180 --> 01:18:03,180
Never mind. Can you please hurry?

877
01:18:03,180 --> 01:18:04,480
No problem. Sit.

878
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:06,480
Isn't mamma here?

879
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:07,480
She's gone out.

880
01:18:07,480 --> 01:18:09,480
Then I will come back later.

881
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:11,480
Hey sit. Let me call him.

882
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:13,480
Sit.

883
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:15,480
I'll be right back.

884
01:18:48,980 --> 01:18:50,480
Why have you brought me here?

885
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:52,480
Believe me, it is for your safety

886
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:54,480
Come.

887
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:26,480
I called him.

888
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:30,480
Here,

889
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:32,480
No. Thank You.

890
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:34,480
I'll come and meet Mustafa some time later.

891
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:36,480
It's okay. Sit.

892
01:19:39,780 --> 01:19:41,780
I called him.

893
01:19:41,780 --> 01:19:43,780
He said he is almost here.

894
01:19:44,580 --> 01:19:46,580
How can I not offer anything to our guest.

895
01:19:46,580 --> 01:19:48,580
Drink this.

896
01:19:48,580 --> 01:19:50,580
Have it.

897
01:20:02,580 --> 01:20:04,580
Mustafa is very young.

898
01:20:04,580 --> 01:20:07,580
Don't hesitate to ask me for any help you may need.

899
01:20:07,580 --> 01:20:09,580
Okay?

900
01:20:09,580 --> 01:20:12,580
I am ready to do anything.

901
01:20:12,580 --> 01:20:14,580
Drink it.

902
01:20:20,580 --> 01:20:24,080
Has he told you anything about us?

903
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:28,080
Specifically, has he said anything recently?

904
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:29,080
Has he?

905
01:20:29,080 --> 01:20:30,080
No.

906
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:38,080
Salma,

907
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:40,080
Shall I tell you a fact?

908
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:44,080
You are really gorgeous.

909
01:20:44,080 --> 01:20:48,080
Especially your eyes.

910
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:51,080
Take your hands off me

911
01:20:59,080 --> 01:21:02,080
Did the police ever come to your house?

912
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:08,080
Didn't you hear me?

913
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:11,080
Has the police ever come there?

914
01:21:11,080 --> 01:21:13,080
Tell me!

915
01:21:13,080 --> 01:21:15,080
What did you tell them?

916
01:21:17,080 --> 01:21:19,080
Did you tell them anything that Mustafa told you?

917
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:21,580
Tell me...tell me!

918
01:21:22,580 --> 01:21:24,580
I'm asking you --

919
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:28,080
Don't act smart with me.

920
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:30,080
Tell me the truth.

921
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:34,080
So you won't tell me, huh?

922
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:40,080
You don't have to tell.

923
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:08,080
Jose, Jose.

924
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:12,080
Even if you wish to say,

925
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:14,080
I won't allow you to.

926
01:22:17,080 --> 01:22:18,080
Jose, let go.

927
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:20,080
Shut up!

928
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:22,080
Let it all end with you.

929
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:24,080
Let it end.

930
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:26,080
Let it end. let it end!

931
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:13,080
Hey Mustafa

932
01:24:31,080 --> 01:24:33,080
Ask him to have breakfast and get ready

933
01:24:33,080 --> 01:24:35,080
I'll wait outside.

934
01:24:39,080 --> 01:24:41,080
Musthafa,

935
01:24:42,080 --> 01:24:44,080
Have you ever thought about these trees?

936
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:48,580
They offer shade to several living creatures.

937
01:24:49,580 --> 01:24:55,580
But if their branches spread to our homes or electric posts, we cut them without any mercy.

938
01:24:56,580 --> 01:24:58,580
Criminals have to be treated the same way.

939
01:24:59,080 --> 01:25:04,080
When they start affecting the peace and goodness in the society, we use the law to take them down.

940
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:06,080
That's our duty as the police.

941
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:14,080
The many things one does right is what forms the foundation of his life.

942
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:16,580
But one misdeed can ruin it all.

943
01:25:17,580 --> 01:25:20,080
As long as they aren't caught they keep repeating the same wrong-doings

944
01:25:21,080 --> 01:25:23,080
Finally when they begin to realize that they will get caught,

945
01:25:23,080 --> 01:25:25,580
they start erasing the evidence.

946
01:25:26,580 --> 01:25:29,080
Businessmen, Politicians, Celebrities ...

947
01:25:29,080 --> 01:25:31,080
All kinds of people.

948
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:36,580
Take the case of your own uncles...

949
01:25:37,580 --> 01:25:42,080
They used political power and money to get away from all the cases against them.

950
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:45,080
They think it will always work.

951
01:25:45,080 --> 01:25:46,780
But the final victory --

952
01:25:46,780 --> 01:25:48,780
That will always be that of the truth.

953
01:25:48,780 --> 01:25:50,780
And only the truth!

954
01:25:50,780 --> 01:25:52,780
Now they might be feeling

955
01:25:52,780 --> 01:25:54,780
that they are strong.

956
01:26:00,780 --> 01:26:02,780
Do you think they will protect you?

957
01:26:03,780 --> 01:26:05,780
They will betray you.

958
01:26:06,780 --> 01:26:09,780
They will get rid of you when they feel you are in their way.

959
01:26:09,780 --> 01:26:11,780
Just a small decision of yours will do.

960
01:26:11,780 --> 01:26:14,780
We can beat a much greater wrong.

961
01:26:14,780 --> 01:26:17,780
If you have unknowingly committed any mistake

962
01:26:17,780 --> 01:26:20,780
I can keep you protected you by making you a witness.

963
01:26:22,780 --> 01:26:24,780
I know your situation.

964
01:26:24,780 --> 01:26:26,780
All I can do is advice.

965
01:26:26,780 --> 01:26:28,780
You are the one who has to decide.

966
01:26:31,780 --> 01:26:33,780
Why are you telling me all this?

967
01:26:33,780 --> 01:26:35,780
I don't know anything. I'm leaving.

968
01:27:09,780 --> 01:27:12,780
Where were you yesterday?

969
01:27:12,780 --> 01:27:14,780
I..

970
01:27:14,780 --> 01:27:16,780
Was at Salmas house.

971
01:27:20,780 --> 01:27:22,780
Was there an occasion?

972
01:27:26,780 --> 01:27:28,780
How's Salma doing?

973
01:27:30,280 --> 01:27:31,280
Fine

974
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:33,280
Phone ringing

975
01:28:37,280 --> 01:28:39,280
Don't run..Stop

976
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:41,280
Hey, stop there.

977
01:28:43,280 --> 01:28:45,280
Musthafa

978
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:47,280
Hey --

979
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:49,280
Shit!

980
01:28:53,280 --> 01:28:55,280
Where are the car keys?

981
01:28:55,280 --> 01:28:57,280
Hey, where are the car keys?

982
01:28:57,280 --> 01:28:59,280
I haven't seen them.

983
01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:01,280
One can't find anything in this house!

984
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:02,680
What? What is it?

985
01:29:02,680 --> 01:29:04,280
Mother, where are the car keys?

986
01:29:04,280 --> 01:29:05,780
It must be somewhere around here.

987
01:29:05,780 --> 01:29:07,280
Move. Just move aside.

988
01:29:07,280 --> 01:29:09,280
Always making silly excuses.

989
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:11,280
Can't find it anywhere!

990
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:13,280
Jose,

991
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:15,280
Shouldn't it be there?

992
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:21,280
Hey,

993
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:23,280
Where is that girl's house?

994
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:24,280
Which girl?

995
01:29:24,280 --> 01:29:25,880
Salmas. Where is Salma's house?

996
01:29:25,880 --> 01:29:26,880
Don't you already know that?

997
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:28,880
Hurry up and tell me where it is.

998
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:30,880
Didn't we both go together.

999
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:33,880
Just answer my question. No need to interrogate me.

1000
01:29:33,880 --> 01:29:35,180
What happened to you, Jose?

1001
01:29:35,180 --> 01:29:36,180
Hey shut up.

1002
01:29:36,180 --> 01:29:38,180
Just tell me, bastard!

1003
01:29:38,180 --> 01:29:39,180
Tell me.

1004
01:29:40,180 --> 01:29:42,680
Tell me. Where is Salma's house?

1005
01:29:48,680 --> 01:29:50,680
Where is Salma?

1006
01:29:50,680 --> 01:29:52,180
She is not here.

1007
01:29:52,180 --> 01:29:53,180
Where did she go?

1008
01:29:53,180 --> 01:29:55,180
She went to her aunt's house yesterday.

1009
01:29:55,180 --> 01:29:57,680
She's not been answering calls.

1010
01:29:57,680 --> 01:29:59,680
Take a seat.

1011
01:30:00,680 --> 01:30:02,680
Uncle, could I use the toilet?

1012
01:30:02,680 --> 01:30:04,680
Sure. Go ahead.

1013
01:31:12,680 --> 01:31:14,680
Phone ringing

1014
01:31:16,680 --> 01:31:18,680
Phone ringing

1015
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:22,180
Hey, hurry up and leave that house.

1016
01:31:22,180 --> 01:31:23,980
Jose is on his way there.

1017
01:31:23,980 --> 01:31:25,980
Hurry up and leave that place.

1018
01:31:25,980 --> 01:31:27,980
Can you hear me?

1019
01:31:33,980 --> 01:31:36,480
Uncle, I need a favour--

1020
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:37,480
What is it?

1021
01:31:37,480 --> 01:31:39,980
I need to go to the town urgently.

1022
01:31:43,980 --> 01:31:45,980
Come

1023
01:31:57,980 --> 01:31:59,980
Hey, stop there.

1024
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:01,980
Hey. You!

1025
01:32:01,980 --> 01:32:03,980
Hey! Stop!

1026
01:33:42,980 --> 01:33:44,980
Is that how you cut vegetables? You're falling asleep over them.

1027
01:33:44,980 --> 01:33:46,980
Put it in this.

1028
01:33:52,680 --> 01:33:54,680
Here, this is a special preparation.

1029
01:33:54,680 --> 01:33:56,680
Taste it and tell me how it is.

1030
01:34:02,180 --> 01:34:02,780
It's good, sir.

1031
01:34:02,780 --> 01:34:04,780
Take it off the stove in 5 minutes.

1032
01:34:04,780 --> 01:34:06,780
I'll just take a shower and come.

1033
01:34:06,780 --> 01:34:08,780
Don't fall asleep, now.

1034
01:34:36,780 --> 01:34:40,780
We're not getting bail as expected.

1035
01:34:40,780 --> 01:34:45,780
The court has already rejected the bail twice.

1036
01:34:45,780 --> 01:34:49,780
You are not putting in enough efforts.

1037
01:34:49,780 --> 01:34:51,780
How can you say that?

1038
01:34:53,280 --> 01:34:55,280
Do you think I won't do my best?

1039
01:34:55,280 --> 01:34:58,280
Things are getting out of hand.

1040
01:34:58,280 --> 01:35:01,280
The high Court is our last hope.

1041
01:35:01,280 --> 01:35:03,280
High Court or Supreme Court.

1042
01:35:03,280 --> 01:35:05,280
You must throw in some more money, if you need to.

1043
01:35:05,280 --> 01:35:08,280
Change the lawyer if you have to.

1044
01:35:08,280 --> 01:35:10,280
Don't get tensed, son.

1045
01:35:10,280 --> 01:35:12,280
The lawyer is not a problem.

1046
01:35:12,280 --> 01:35:14,280
I need to get out of here. And fast.

1047
01:35:14,280 --> 01:35:18,280
Do whatever is necessary to make that happen.

1048
01:35:18,280 --> 01:35:22,280
By hook or crook. Understand?

1049
01:35:24,280 --> 01:35:25,280
Alex

1050
01:35:25,280 --> 01:35:27,280
Why are you so silent?

1051
01:35:27,280 --> 01:35:31,280
Why aren't you talking to mother? Whose death are you mourning?

1052
01:35:32,280 --> 01:35:35,280
Jail and court are meant for real men.

1053
01:35:35,280 --> 01:35:36,280
Enough!

1054
01:35:36,280 --> 01:35:38,280
Now don't start arguing.

1055
01:35:39,080 --> 01:35:42,080
You've always thought of me as a squabbler.

1056
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:46,580
After all, I grew up watching you and dad fight.

1057
01:35:48,580 --> 01:35:52,580
Just get lost without creating a scene here.

1058
01:35:52,580 --> 01:35:54,580
I am out of here.

1059
01:35:54,580 --> 01:35:58,580
It's because of you that everyone is suffering today.

1060
01:35:58,580 --> 01:36:01,080
I decide whether to bring you out or not.

1061
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:04,080
I am your mother.

1062
01:36:04,080 --> 01:36:06,080
You should remember that.

1063
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:16,080
Son,

1064
01:36:16,080 --> 01:36:19,080
Say something --

1065
01:36:43,080 --> 01:36:45,080
Why did you ask me to come?

1066
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:49,080
We have to do something about his case.

1067
01:36:51,080 --> 01:36:53,080
If you're talking about Musthafa, then it's risky.

1068
01:36:53,080 --> 01:36:57,080
Because he is the sole witness in this case.

1069
01:36:57,080 --> 01:37:00,580
If something happens to him in their custody then it will be a huge headache for all of us.

1070
01:37:00,580 --> 01:37:03,580
Not just that, he is in their secret hideout.

1071
01:37:03,580 --> 01:37:05,580
And it's hard to find it.

1072
01:37:09,580 --> 01:37:11,580
He is in this address.

1073
01:37:23,580 --> 01:37:25,580
This is a huge risk.

1074
01:37:25,580 --> 01:37:29,080
Is there anything else we can do? There are chances we could get a bail.

1075
01:37:29,080 --> 01:37:31,080
Only a chance?

1076
01:37:31,080 --> 01:37:33,080
You cannot guarantee it, can you?

1077
01:37:38,080 --> 01:37:40,580
How did you get this address that is known only to the police?

1078
01:37:40,580 --> 01:37:42,580
Narendran,

1079
01:37:43,580 --> 01:37:47,580
I've been seeing all this ever since Carlos was running the business

1080
01:37:48,580 --> 01:37:52,580
I've been playing this game for quite some time now.

1081
01:37:52,580 --> 01:37:56,580
Even when Carlos got shot,

1082
01:37:56,580 --> 01:37:58,580
I never gave up.

1083
01:37:58,580 --> 01:38:01,580
It is for these children that I stayed strong.

1084
01:38:01,580 --> 01:38:04,080
What I'm saying is --

1085
01:38:04,080 --> 01:38:08,080
If anyone comes between my kids and me,

1086
01:38:08,080 --> 01:38:12,080
I will do away with them!

1087
01:38:12,080 --> 01:38:14,080
But, Musthafa...

1088
01:38:15,580 --> 01:38:17,580
Musthafa!

1089
01:38:17,580 --> 01:38:19,580
He's gone.

1090
01:38:19,580 --> 01:38:21,580
Not just from my house.

1091
01:38:21,580 --> 01:38:23,580
But also from my heart.

1092
01:38:24,580 --> 01:38:26,580
Don't expect anything of him anymore.

1093
01:38:27,580 --> 01:38:31,580
One time, she chose her path, leaving the family behind.

1094
01:38:31,580 --> 01:38:33,580
His mother, I mean.

1095
01:38:33,580 --> 01:38:35,580
Now, he follows in her footsteps.

1096
01:38:36,580 --> 01:38:41,580
There is no point in trying to fix what cannot be mended.

1097
01:38:43,580 --> 01:38:45,580
Nothing is more important to me than my kids.

1098
01:38:45,580 --> 01:38:52,580
If the lord decides Mustafa should be sacrificed in order to save my kids, then, so be it.

1099
01:38:54,580 --> 01:38:58,580
To me, my kids are more important than my grandkids.

1100
01:38:59,880 --> 01:39:02,380
Even if they are biggest scoundrels.

1101
01:39:03,380 --> 01:39:08,380
I cannot think of a life without them.

1102
01:39:13,380 --> 01:39:15,380
This puts my career at risk.

1103
01:39:15,380 --> 01:39:16,880
No matter what you offer,

1104
01:39:16,880 --> 01:39:19,380
I won't put my career at risk and join you.

1105
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:23,380
You should've raised them properly.

1106
01:39:23,380 --> 01:39:26,880
You and your kids alone, must have to suffer the consequences.

1107
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:31,380
You cannot burden us with into your issues and then leave us stranded.

1108
01:39:33,180 --> 01:39:37,680
The main evidence of this case is the gun used to commit the murder.

1109
01:39:37,680 --> 01:39:41,280
Forget the police, even the military won't be able to find it.

1110
01:39:41,280 --> 01:39:43,280
And that car

1111
01:39:43,280 --> 01:39:45,280
that is in their custody --

1112
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:48,680
Even though the car belongs to someone else,

1113
01:39:48,680 --> 01:39:52,180
It was stolen by Musthafa.

1114
01:39:52,180 --> 01:39:56,180
He is also considered a witness in Salma's murder

1115
01:39:56,180 --> 01:39:58,180
If he opens up about all of these, to the police,

1116
01:39:58,180 --> 01:40:00,180
Then, we will all end up behind bars.

1117
01:40:00,180 --> 01:40:02,180
Not all of us, just your kids.

1118
01:40:02,180 --> 01:40:04,180
Only them. Isn't that right?

1119
01:40:04,180 --> 01:40:06,180
It might be right.

1120
01:40:06,180 --> 01:40:11,180
You know the share you have in the various deals with my kids.

1121
01:40:12,680 --> 01:40:15,180
Don't forget all that, Sudhakaran.

1122
01:40:15,180 --> 01:40:17,180
Do you have any evidence to prove that?

1123
01:40:17,180 --> 01:40:19,180
Your thinking that I don't have evidence, doesn't mean the evidence doesn't exist. Correct?

1124
01:40:20,180 --> 01:40:25,180
Mustafa had once accompanied Solomon for a deal with you ...

1125
01:40:31,180 --> 01:40:33,180
Are you trying to blackmail me?

1126
01:40:36,180 --> 01:40:38,180
I hadn't thought of it that way, until now.

1127
01:40:39,180 --> 01:40:41,680
I need my children out of prison

1128
01:40:41,680 --> 01:40:44,180
For that I will do whatever it takes

1129
01:40:44,180 --> 01:40:47,180
No matter how gruesome the means have to be.

1130
01:40:49,180 --> 01:40:50,680
I need some time to think.

1131
01:40:50,680 --> 01:40:52,680
Go ahead, think.

1132
01:40:52,680 --> 01:40:54,680
Take your time.

1133
01:40:54,680 --> 01:40:57,680
You have time until dawn to think.

1134
01:40:57,680 --> 01:40:59,680
Then it's time to act.

1135
01:40:59,680 --> 01:41:03,680
You know me very well, Sudhakaran

1136
01:41:05,380 --> 01:41:07,380
I'm not like my children.

1137
01:42:05,380 --> 01:42:09,380
I never thought I would have to see my kids in this condition.

1138
01:42:11,080 --> 01:42:13,580
As prisoners.

1139
01:42:23,580 --> 01:42:25,580
Musthafa?

1140
01:42:31,580 --> 01:42:33,580
Come in, son.

1141
01:42:33,580 --> 01:42:35,580
Who is that?

1142
01:42:35,580 --> 01:42:37,580
She's our neighbour.

1143
01:42:38,580 --> 01:42:40,580
Grandma, please come with me.

1144
01:42:40,580 --> 01:42:41,580
Why?

1145
01:42:41,580 --> 01:42:43,580
I need to tell you something.

1146
01:42:45,580 --> 01:42:47,580
Sure, we can speak.

1147
01:42:47,580 --> 01:42:49,180
Don't get tensed.

1148
01:42:49,180 --> 01:42:53,180
Mamma will take care of you, okay?

1149
01:43:07,180 --> 01:43:09,180
Now you must've understood

1150
01:43:09,180 --> 01:43:11,180
that police custody is not exactly safe.

1151
01:43:11,180 --> 01:43:13,180
You stay with Grandma.

1152
01:43:14,180 --> 01:43:16,180
She needs a helping hand at this time.

1153
01:43:16,180 --> 01:43:18,180
And you don't have to be scared of your uncles either.

1154
01:43:21,180 --> 01:43:24,180
What problem do you have here anyway?

1155
01:43:24,180 --> 01:43:32,680
It is natural to have uncles and nephews having tussles and then working it out. It happens in every family.

1156
01:43:32,680 --> 01:43:35,680
For me, you all are equally important.

1157
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:40,680
I won't let anything happen to you while I'm alive.

1158
01:44:00,680 --> 01:44:02,680
I am Advocate Arundathi Menon.

1159
01:44:02,680 --> 01:44:04,680
Aren't you Mustafa?

1160
01:44:04,680 --> 01:44:06,680
Yes.

1161
01:44:32,680 --> 01:44:34,680
Where were you till now?

1162
01:44:34,680 --> 01:44:36,680
Come with me.

1163
01:44:38,680 --> 01:44:41,180
Tell me, where were you?

1164
01:44:41,180 --> 01:44:43,180
I was just staying away for a while.

1165
01:44:43,180 --> 01:44:45,180
We arrested the guy who came to attack you

1166
01:44:46,480 --> 01:44:48,480
Why didn't you call me?

1167
01:44:48,480 --> 01:44:50,480
I lost my phone during the incident.

1168
01:44:50,480 --> 01:44:52,980
Did you meet anyone while you were gone?

1169
01:44:52,980 --> 01:44:54,980
No

1170
01:45:16,980 --> 01:45:18,980
Musthafa,

1171
01:45:19,980 --> 01:45:21,980
I'm in a lot of tension.

1172
01:45:21,980 --> 01:45:23,980
We will know the verdict of the case today.

1173
01:45:47,280 --> 01:45:49,280
They must have told you most of the things.

1174
01:45:50,680 --> 01:45:56,180
Now all you have to do is support them. Leave the rest to your conscience.

1175
01:45:57,180 --> 01:46:00,180
You have the freedom to decide things yourself.

1176
01:46:04,180 --> 01:46:08,680
A single statement can decide the outcome of a case in court.

1177
01:46:12,280 --> 01:46:14,280
Many things are in our favour, in this case.

1178
01:46:14,280 --> 01:46:18,280
Now it's your statement that is going to turn things around.

1179
01:46:19,980 --> 01:46:23,980
Every word you speak in court is like a fired weapon.

1180
01:46:23,980 --> 01:46:26,980
Just one mistake and it will turn against us.

1181
01:46:26,980 --> 01:46:29,980
Then it will be used as evidence by the prosecution.

1182
01:46:29,980 --> 01:46:34,980
Then they will have to continue as prisoners without ever getting bail.

1183
01:46:35,980 --> 01:46:39,980
The prosecution has no solid witness other than you.

1184
01:46:39,980 --> 01:46:41,980
Similarly only you

1185
01:46:41,980 --> 01:46:43,980
can save your uncles.

1186
01:46:51,980 --> 01:46:53,980
Musthafa,

1187
01:46:53,980 --> 01:46:55,980
I know you loved her a lot.

1188
01:46:57,980 --> 01:46:59,980
There's nothing we can do about what has happened.

1189
01:46:59,980 --> 01:47:04,980
If it will make you feel any better -- your mother and Salma are in God's care, now.

1190
01:47:05,680 --> 01:47:08,680
Now all you have left in this world are your Grandmother and your Uncles.

1191
01:47:10,080 --> 01:47:12,880
The Police need you only until the judgement of this case is passed.

1192
01:47:13,880 --> 01:47:15,880
Policemen are like that --

1193
01:47:15,880 --> 01:47:17,880
They will forget you once the case is over.

1194
01:47:18,880 --> 01:47:21,380
Then they will replace you with another person for another case.

1195
01:47:21,380 --> 01:47:23,380
You are disposable.

1196
01:47:23,380 --> 01:47:27,380
They grow in their ranks by using people like you, as pawns.

1197
01:47:30,580 --> 01:47:35,580
The standing of the prosecution depends on your decision, Musthafa.

1198
01:47:36,280 --> 01:47:40,280
You have to listen to your conscience.

1199
01:47:42,280 --> 01:47:44,280
Maybe,

1200
01:47:44,280 --> 01:47:47,280
When you tell the truth

1201
01:47:47,280 --> 01:47:49,280
you lose a few things in life.

1202
01:47:49,280 --> 01:47:54,280
But you will never have to feel guilty for standing up for the truth.

1203
01:47:55,080 --> 01:47:58,080
Sometimes we'll have to hide some facts

1204
01:47:58,080 --> 01:47:59,080
Because

1205
01:47:59,780 --> 01:48:05,280
Sharing them with the society will not bring back the people that we lost.

1206
01:48:07,280 --> 01:48:09,280
Do this for the sake of your deceased mother.

1207
01:48:09,280 --> 01:48:13,280
You will be helping her brothers.

1208
01:48:13,280 --> 01:48:14,280
And as a result,

1209
01:48:14,980 --> 01:48:16,980
I will get back my kids.

1210
01:48:16,980 --> 01:48:19,180
It's a mother's humble request.

1211
01:48:21,180 --> 01:48:23,180
They are culprits.

1212
01:48:23,180 --> 01:48:25,180
And they deserve the punishment for that.

1213
01:48:26,180 --> 01:48:28,180
I trust you.

1214
01:48:28,180 --> 01:48:30,180
You are not like them.

1215
01:48:31,180 --> 01:48:33,180
You cannot become like them.

1216
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:44,480
In order to win the case I will ask you in court whether Salma was a drug addict.

1217
01:48:44,480 --> 01:48:46,480
And you should say that she was.

1218
01:48:48,480 --> 01:48:49,980
Then I will ask you

1219
01:48:49,980 --> 01:48:54,480
If you were aware of her illicit relationships with other men.

1220
01:48:54,480 --> 01:48:56,980
Even for that you should say, Yes.

1221
01:48:58,180 --> 01:48:59,180
As for the reason of her death,

1222
01:48:59,180 --> 01:49:02,680
it has been proven that she overdosed. It's in the post-mortem report.

1223
01:49:41,680 --> 01:49:43,680
Isn't this such a big insult to the entire Kerala Police Department, Sir?

1224
01:51:19,680 --> 01:51:22,180
Do you think you did the right thing?

1225
01:52:07,180 --> 01:52:09,180
This is the victory of truth.

1226
01:52:10,180 --> 01:52:14,180
How many innocent people are being punished in this country!

1227
01:52:14,180 --> 01:52:15,180
This judgement

1228
01:52:15,180 --> 01:52:19,180
is a befitting reply to the arrogance of the police.

1229
01:52:20,180 --> 01:52:26,680
The trust in our Judicial system has been restored once again.

1230
01:52:28,380 --> 01:52:31,080
They turned my grandson into a false witness.

1231
01:52:31,580 --> 01:52:35,580
They threatened him and forced him to give a fake statement.

1232
01:52:37,580 --> 01:52:43,080
Not falling for their threats, he told the truth.

1233
01:52:45,080 --> 01:52:49,080
The police has a habit of arresting innocents when they fail to find the actual culprits.

1234
01:52:51,080 --> 01:52:57,080
The plans of those who are jealous of my children's stature, have been shattered here.

1235
01:53:00,080 --> 01:53:03,580
Sir, please sit there. I need to take a closeup shot. You can say anything you like...

1236
01:53:03,580 --> 01:53:07,580
Pack all this up and leave this place immediately!

1237
01:53:07,580 --> 01:53:10,080
Or I will throw all this away

1238
01:53:34,080 --> 01:53:35,080
Sir

1239
01:53:36,380 --> 01:53:38,380
How are you?

1240
01:53:39,780 --> 01:53:42,280
Were you able to find the actual culprits?

1241
01:53:44,280 --> 01:53:49,780
I hope you will be able to find them soon and bring them to justice.

1242
01:53:52,780 --> 01:53:56,780
Mine and my family's prayers will always be there with you.

1243
01:53:58,780 --> 01:54:00,580
Don't be fooled thinking you are very smart.

1244
01:54:00,580 --> 01:54:05,580
Maybe this case will also rust and remain unsolved, just like many other cases in the country.

1245
01:54:05,580 --> 01:54:07,580
Just maybe.

1246
01:54:11,080 --> 01:54:16,080
You can never escape from your own conscience.

1247
01:54:18,080 --> 01:54:20,080
It will follow you till your death.

1248
01:54:21,880 --> 01:54:24,880
I hope you have this same level of self confidence when we meet next.

1249
01:54:26,680 --> 01:54:28,680
That is my prayer for you.

1250
01:54:52,680 --> 01:54:55,380
How are you and your mother?

1251
01:54:55,380 --> 01:54:56,680
We are doing fine.

1252
01:54:56,680 --> 01:54:58,680
Ok, Jose.

1253
01:55:11,680 --> 01:55:13,680
Hey, Mamma ...

1254
01:55:13,680 --> 01:55:15,680
Musthafa

1255
01:55:17,680 --> 01:55:19,680
Where were you till now, son?

1256
01:55:19,680 --> 01:55:22,180
I got a job in an I.T company, nearby.

1257
01:55:23,180 --> 01:55:25,180
That's really good news.

1258
01:55:25,180 --> 01:55:27,180
You should stay with us.

1259
01:55:27,180 --> 01:55:29,180
We have kept your room intact.

1260
01:55:29,180 --> 01:55:30,480
Where is everybody?

1261
01:55:30,480 --> 01:55:32,480
They have gone to church. They'll be back soon.

1262
01:55:32,480 --> 01:55:34,480
Come in.

1263
01:55:50,480 --> 01:55:52,480
Alex, just call and inform them.

1264
01:55:52,480 --> 01:55:54,480
Okay.

1265
01:56:04,480 --> 01:56:08,480
Mother,

1266
01:56:12,480 --> 01:56:13,480
I'm right here

1267
01:56:13,480 --> 01:56:14,880
Did you pray well?

1268
01:56:14,880 --> 01:56:16,880
Yes I did. Whole heartedly.

1269
01:56:16,880 --> 01:56:18,480
Mustafa is here.

1270
01:56:18,480 --> 01:56:20,480
Oh is he?

1271
01:56:20,480 --> 01:56:21,780
You go and bring him down for lunch.

1272
01:56:21,780 --> 01:56:23,780
Okay, I will bring him.

1273
01:56:25,280 --> 01:56:27,280
Hey, Mustafa.

1274
01:56:27,280 --> 01:56:29,280
Why are you sitting here?

1275
01:56:31,280 --> 01:56:33,280
Long time!

1276
01:56:37,280 --> 01:56:39,280
Son,

1277
01:56:39,280 --> 01:56:43,280
Life is unpredictable.

1278
01:56:45,280 --> 01:56:47,280
We expect something

1279
01:56:47,280 --> 01:56:51,280
Not knowing that something else awaits us.
