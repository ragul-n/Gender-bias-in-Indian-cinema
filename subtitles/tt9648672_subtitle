1
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,940
Welcome to the Ground
Zero Battle 2017.

2
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:14,990
The biggest and the baddest
ground battle arena.

3
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:16,630
This is the semi-final round...

4
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,990
...between the Predators
and Street Dancers.

5
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:19,870
Hey DJ.

6
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:21,510
Drop the goddamn beat.

7
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,090
Street dancer!

8
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:00,560
Street dancer!

9
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,950
Street dancer!

10
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,420
Street dancer!

11
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,920
Street dancer!

12
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,520
Street dancer!

13
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,110
Street dancer!

14
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:17,620
Come on, brother.

15
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,990
Come on, brother.

16
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,160
Street dancer!

17
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,620
Street dancer!

18
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,910
Street dancer!

19
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,280
Street dancer!

20
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,530
Street dancer!

21
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:54,980
Street dancer!

22
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:55,890
Street dancer!

23
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:57,100
Street dancer!

24
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,230
Street dancer!

25
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,670
Street dancer!

26
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:33,000
- Brother.
- Your beloved son's awake.

27
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,080
I hardly see him
since he returned from Punjab.

28
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:36,880
- He's coming, get a good look.
- Mom.

29
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,080
- Where is brother?
- He's outside.

30
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:43,450
- You can wish us good morning as well.
- Morning.

31
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,490
- Yeah...
- And one more.

32
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:47,540
Yeah...

33
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,160
- Better-Better-Better.
- And again.

34
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:51,370
Yeah...

35
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:53,620
- Care for one more?
- One more. One more.

36
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,870
- Brother, are you okay?
- I am okay. What's wrong with you?

37
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:58,740
- Yeah, better.
- Well, I have a surprise for you.

38
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:01,030
Come on.
Put it down. Put it down.

39
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,080
I have a surprise for you.
Come on.

40
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,160
- Can you get that?
- Yes.

41
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,250
- You're unbelievable.
- Is she coming too?

42
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:07,370
You never stop, do you?

43
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,990
Yeah, thank you so much.
See you tomorrow.

44
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,370
Yeah, see you tomorrow.

45
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:12,580
Come every day.

46
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:13,950
Come on.

47
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,370
Where are you taking me, Sahej?

48
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:18,330
Stop asking questions, brother.
It's a surprise.

49
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,990
Come on, you're going to love it.

50
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,580
Okay, you ready?

51
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,160
Attention! Attention Everyone!

52
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,990
This is where all the
magic's going to happen.

53
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,030
Welcome to our Dance Studio.

54
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,160
Enter without any pass...

55
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,200
What's the matter?

56
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:45,620
No "yeah", no "wow".

57
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:47,160
I mean...

58
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:51,450
- Don't you like it?
- No, Sahej. It's wonderful.

59
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,160
But how did you pay for this place?

60
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,740
"How" is not important.

61
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:56,580
I got it all figured out,
that's important.

62
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,450
- Now we're going to...
- Sahej. Sahej. Sahej.

63
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,700
This is a huge place?
Now give me a straight answer.

64
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,080
Where did you get the money?

65
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,160
On my trip to India,
I made some bets on the IPL matches.

66
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,160
After that, I used money laundering.

67
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:12,160
And then I saw that you're standing like
Saajan's Sanjay Dutt, all serious.

68
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,830
Can you believe your brother
can do anything like that?

69
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:17,740
When I was attending the wedding...

70
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:19,620
...some guy saw my dance.

71
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,120
And he offered me a show.

72
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,530
I wish he had seen you dance,
he would've been mind-blown.

73
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:24,870
But enough of that.

74
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,450
The Street Dancer Crew
are going to practise here now.

75
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,740
And you will be teaching the kids.

76
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:44,700
Only your knee's broken,
not your dreams.

77
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,830
I will make all your dreams come true.

78
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,120
Thank you.

79
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:53,740
But I've another question.

80
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,700
Are we going to practise
alone in this huge place?

81
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,280
Where are the others?

82
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:00,780
Where's the gang?

83
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:06,780
Welcome to Antique shop.

84
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:09,330
Do you understand Hindi?

85
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,980
- Of course, we do.
- Great.

86
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,770
You'll find everything
here that's related to the Queen.

87
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:17,140
Dogs, cats,
fans, etcetera...except for the queen.

88
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,710
As you can see we keep
only the best stuff here.

89
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,270
These frames are antique as well.

90
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,270
- Would you like some tea?
- No thanks.

91
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:24,810
- No, thank you.
- No, but I insist.

92
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:26,230
The tea here is very good.

93
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:28,940
Chotu. Two cups of tea... not!

94
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,940
Wow...beautiful watch.

95
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:35,810
This watch belongs to
Queen Victoria's royal family.

96
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,980
What?
But the needles are missing.

97
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:39,890
- What? No needles?
- No.

98
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:43,020
What do you need the needles for?
Stitch a cloth?

99
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,190
- What?
- Do you know...

100
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:46,340
The Queen would always
look at the lump.

101
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:47,430
What?

102
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:51,140
I mean she used to watch the pendulum.

103
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:53,230
Look, sir. Come closer.

104
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:56,810
Only for you, 450 pounds.

105
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:57,980
Deal?

106
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,520
No.
Let's see something else.

107
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:03,190
See what you like...
Everything here is antique.

108
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:05,060
That's our boss.
Even he's antique.

109
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,140
- Isn't it, boss?
- Hello.

110
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,150
- D...
- Wait a minute.

111
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:09,270
Come on, let's go.

112
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:10,770
Boss, can I go?

113
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:12,190
- Go away.
- Thank you, boss.

114
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:13,810
Let's go. Let's go.

115
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,060
It's superb.

116
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:17,250
Yo boys, look...
new jackets and new studio!

117
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:18,190
What is it?

118
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:20,320
- Bro.
- What is this place?

119
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,060
Boys, Street Dancer's in the House.

120
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,940
- This place is huge.
- This one's yours, Sushi.

121
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,690
- Yo-Yo-Yo...
- Bro.

122
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:29,100
- Come on, D.
- Street Dance.

123
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:30,270
What is this?

124
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:33,480
Did you sell your organs in Punjab?
How did you do it?

125
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:36,100
- Tell us the secret.
- Don't ask "how".

126
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,350
Ask "who" I did it for.

127
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:39,890
I did it for you guys.

128
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,150
Bro...

129
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:42,690
But what did you guys do for me?

130
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:44,190
Did you guys practice?

131
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:46,390
Swear on my job,
we used to meet every day.

132
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,600
As William And Kate,
we were never late.

133
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,230
Oh my, God.

134
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,600
Then show me.

135
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:55,100
Go...let's go...

136
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:56,890
- Let be.
- Lets go.

137
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:59,580
- Wow, that's amazing!
- So cool!

138
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,810
What bro?

139
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,960
Slow motion... slow motion.

140
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:36,100
Enough!

141
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,270
Boys...

142
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,350
Stop it!

143
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,690
Wasn't that amazing?

144
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:43,310
- You liked it, didn't you?
- I like your moves, bro.

145
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:44,850
- I did good right?
- Right...

146
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:47,440
When God is kind,
He blesses with abundance.

147
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,310
And when He's furious,
He takes with a tight slap.

148
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,020
He's snatched your
youth a long time ago.

149
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,810
You guys have been doing the same
steps for the last couple of years.

150
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:56,850
But we upgraded our moves.

151
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,770
- This one...and that one...
- Can't you think of anything new?

152
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,890
Great, Sahej, new studio.

153
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,270
New jacket.

154
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:04,850
New passion.

155
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:08,610
But the same old dance moves.

156
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:10,850
Get out. Get out.
Only Street Dancers allowed here.

157
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:13,140
Someone's got to talk to them.

158
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:16,230
- Someone's got to talk to them, Sahej.
- When Elephants stride through the jungle,

159
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:18,140
dogs bark at them.
So let them bark.

160
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,150
- Yeah, exactly.
- So as I was saying...

161
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:20,940
just focus like horses.

162
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:22,520
- Okay.
- Wait a minute.

163
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:25,270
- Are we elephants or horses?
- You guys are donkeys.

164
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:26,770
We've got this beautiful studio...

165
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,190
Sahej is right.

166
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:30,770
You guys are donkeys.

167
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:31,940
See...

168
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,390
- See, Poddy.
- Oh man,

169
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,770
I thought since we're
all meeting after a long time...

170
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:38,390
...we'll get to see something new.

171
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:40,650
But I guess these guys
don't know anything new.

172
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:42,520
I think they are all scared.

173
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,770
Doesn't that make your blood boil?

174
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,690
Do something. Go do it there.

175
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:48,480
Beat them.

176
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:50,020
Calm down, boys.
What are you doing?

177
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,480
Beat them.

178
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,980
Come on.
Come on.

179
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:56,690
Guys, guys, stop.

180
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:58,110
- Please.
- Back. Back. Back.

181
00:11:58,190 --> 00:11:59,060
- Scared?
- Hey...

182
00:11:59,150 --> 00:11:59,900
Leave it, Sahej.

183
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,690
You guys wanted to see something new,
didn't you?

184
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,720
About turn losers.

185
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:34,100
"With my kohl laden eyes..."

186
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:36,980
"...I aim straight for the heart."

187
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:43,960
"With my kohl laden eyes..."

188
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:46,730
"...I aim straight for the heart."

189
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:49,480
"Don't get your hopes too high,
sweetheart."

190
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:51,770
"Don't get your hopes too high,
sweetheart."

191
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:54,690
"You're not my type at all,
sweetheart."

192
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:56,850
"Keeps the guys hanging
by the noose..."

193
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,690
"...my attitude's
sharper than a sword."

194
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:01,940
"Keeps the guys hanging
by the noose..."

195
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:04,480
"...my attitude's
sharper than a sword."

196
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:22,940
"I am a hot topic, sweetheart..."

197
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:26,020
"...because I hit the gym twice a day,
to stay fit sweetheart."

198
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:27,870
"...stay fit, sweetheart!"

199
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:33,020
"Everyone talks about me..."

200
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:37,270
"...because my natural beauty's
is a hit, sweetheart."

201
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,160
"Don't try to hit on me, sweetheart."

202
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,320
"Don't try to hit on me, sweetheart."

203
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,100
"You're not my type, sweetheart."

204
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:47,310
"Keeps the guys hanging
by the noose..."

205
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,150
"...my attitude's
sharper than a sword."

206
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:52,400
"Keeps the guys hanging
by the noose..."

207
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,650
"...my attitude's
sharper than a sword."

208
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:09,940
"Hey!"

209
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:30,270
"I find you to be hot."

210
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,020
"You go straight for my heart."

211
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,400
"I find you to be hot."

212
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,810
"You go straight for my heart."

213
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:45,810
"Come and shake a leg with me,
sweetheart."

214
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:48,020
"Shake a leg with me, sweetheart."

215
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,730
"I'll make you feel like a superstar."

216
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:53,350
"It pierces through my heart... "

217
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,900
"...your attitude's
sharper than a sword."

218
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:58,100
"It pierces through my heart... "

219
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:00,900
"...your attitude's
sharper than a sword."

220
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:03,100
"Keeps the guys hanging
by the noose..."

221
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:05,770
"...my attitude's
sharper than a sword."

222
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:08,230
"Keeps the guys hanging
by the noose..."

223
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:11,480
"...my attitude's
sharper than a sword."

224
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:41,940
What happen?

225
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:45,100
- Come on, everyone.
- What happened, losers?

226
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:47,480
Next time you want to compete...

227
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:49,100
...learn some new steps first.

228
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,400
We've better things to
do than humiliate you guys.

229
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:53,650
Understood.

230
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,940
Goodbye, losers.

231
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:59,480
Bye, Street Dancers.
What losers!

232
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,730
Look at her attitude.

233
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,020
Attitude.

234
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,190
She's just plain arrogant.

235
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:09,850
You guys never focus on the right
thing. Always on the wrong thing.

236
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:12,850
- It's fine...
- What fine?

237
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,520
We were humiliated

238
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:17,350
You guys better get
one thing straight.

239
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:21,310
Rule no.
1 of dance is, never be no. 2.

240
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,980
Killer...Killer...Killer, guys.

241
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:27,100
We were amazing today, guys.

242
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:30,190
- What a day. What a day. What a day.
- I have to get off.

243
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:32,480
- Zain, let's go.
- Why me?

244
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:34,730
Let me take some advantage
of you being my cousin.

245
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:36,270
- Always
- I get it.

246
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:38,730
Okay, guys, rehearsals on time, okay.

247
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:40,650
- Please.
- Sure, sure...

248
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,480
- See you.
- Bye.

249
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:44,440
- See you.
- Bye.

250
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,690
Inu...I've never
really understood you.

251
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:52,980
- You're so different from the others.
- Why? What's wrong?

252
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,350
When your mom-dad-and your
brother ask where you've been...

253
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:58,270
...you never tell
them you were dancing.

254
00:16:58,580 --> 00:16:59,850
But you don't lie to them either.

255
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:02,020
- I don't understand.
- It's simple, Zain.

256
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:04,730
- What?
- My mind says I should hide the truth...

257
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:07,730
- ...and my heart says don't lie.
- Wonderful.

258
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:11,150
Someday you will get yourself
in trouble, as well as me.

259
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:15,980
Hi, sis.

260
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,770
- Where is everyone?
- Everyone's having dinner.

261
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,150
We're late.

262
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,770
- Inu, practice.
- Practise...

263
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,100
3...4...5...

264
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,690
- Don't be crazy.
- Every player is carefully researched.

265
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:30,850
Sis is back.

266
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:33,940
But Cricket is and will
always be a batsman's game.

267
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,730
- Hello, father.
- Hello.

268
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:37,520
- Hello.
- Hello.

269
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:38,980
- Hello.
- How are you?

270
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:39,940
Join us.

271
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,480
- How are you?
- Where are you?

272
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:44,650
- Sit. Have dinner.
- Please carry on, and I'll join you guys.

273
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:45,440
Fine.

274
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,400
Hey, cutie.

275
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,940
- Greetings, aunty.
- Mom...

276
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,060
Inayat.

277
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:53,110
I was about to call you.

278
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,440
See...I made your favourite Biryani.

279
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:58,480
I already had dinner.

280
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,480
But where have you been since morning?

281
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,440
First I some took some turns...

282
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:11,020
Then stopped in one place.

283
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,480
Did some stretching.

284
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,730
And when I saw the time, I was shaken.

285
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:19,930
And came home.

286
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:21,920
She's back.
That's the only reply you have.

287
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,650
Inayat...where were you from 10 to 2?

288
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,400
Dancing.

289
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,070
Ask her a dozen questions
and she has only one answer?

290
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:43,160
Dancing!

291
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,730
Come, leave these two alone.

292
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:47,840
And finish your dinner.

293
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:33,570
It's 4 am...

294
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:35,920
- It's 4 am...when are you going home.
- Hey Losers.

295
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,320
- Hey...little kids.
- Duplicate Shoaib Akhtar.

296
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,440
Come on, Zain.

297
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,030
Are you going to bark or also bite?

298
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:44,440
Bro, why do you take
everything so personally?

299
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:46,280
- Let's go.
- Wait a second.

300
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:49,360
I meant him, not you.
Shoaib Akhtar.

301
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,700
Move, move...

302
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:53,570
- Come on, we're going to get late...
- Clean bowled!

303
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:59,860
- Let's go, Let's go, Let's go, doing great.
- The match has taken an interesting turn.

304
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,610
Run. Run faster.

305
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:03,280
Let's go, boys. Let's go.

306
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:05,780
They are playing well.

307
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,660
I am worried.

308
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,660
Come on, come on.

309
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:13,700
- Score quick runs.
- Go...come on.

310
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:16,030
- Let's go.
- Yes, yes, yes. Go...

311
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:17,820
Come on, India, come on!

312
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:20,360
These two boys have been spectacular.

313
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:25,490
Boys, can you please give me a beat.

314
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:32,320
"Don't mind, it's Kohli..."
"Don't mind, it's Kohli..."

315
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:35,490
"Don't mind, it's Kohli..."
"Don't mind, it's Kohli..."

316
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:39,200
"Don't mind, it's Kohli..."
"Don't mind, it's Kohli..."

317
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:41,610
"Look at her face..."

318
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:43,780
"...the mirror's right here."

319
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:47,700
"Coming up next is Dhoni,
and later..."

320
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,450
"Raina as well..."

321
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:51,410
- "Don't mind, it's Kohli..."
- Get lost. Get lost.

322
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:52,700
"Don't mind, it's Kohli..."

323
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:55,200
- "Don't mind, it's Kohli..."
- Go back to your side. Go...

324
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,100
- Inu, relax.
- Come on, boys.

325
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,580
Let's go, boys.

326
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:00,030
Well played.. well played.

327
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:01,450
Come on. Come on.

328
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,700
Come on.

329
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,320
And that's a magnificent placement.

330
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:08,240
Run. Run. Run.
Hurray!

331
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:10,360
Yeah.

332
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:11,950
Come on.

333
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:13,660
Boys, can you give me a beat, please?

334
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,490
Take it.

335
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:20,860
"Why would we mind, it's Kohli?"
"Why would we mind, it's Kohli?"

336
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:22,990
"Why would we mind, it's Kohli?"

337
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:24,530
- "Why would we mind, it's Kohli?"
- She's telling you.

338
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:28,110
"When his team is
disappearing one by one."

339
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:31,660
Gone. Gone. Gone. Gone. Gone.

340
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,280
Copycats.

341
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:35,660
- Come on, India.
- Come on.

342
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,620
- Bro...
- Cross your fingers.

343
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,780
Everything is cross. let's see.

344
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:42,950
Come on, boys.

345
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:44,820
Come, come.

346
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:47,110
Gone. Gone. Gone. Gone.

347
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,750
That's a Six...

348
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:56,200
"You are seeing red..."

349
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,530
"...like ketchup on bread."

350
00:21:57,610 --> 00:21:59,360
"Your team playing okay-okay."

351
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:00,950
"But India's..."

352
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:02,820
"...blasting everyone."

353
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:05,780
First, make your English okay- okay.

354
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:08,820
At least his English
is much better than your team.

355
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:13,280
One day a commentator
asked their captain.

356
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,110
"Do you know English?"
He said, "English comes to me".

357
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,110
Meaning "I know English".

358
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,660
How was that?

359
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:29,030
- She hit me.
- Come on, attack.

360
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:32,320
Stay away. Stay away.

361
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:34,780
Move. Move. Move.

362
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,820
Bloody...

363
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:41,660
In my TUC anybody can eat,
but nobody can fight.

364
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:45,570
Cool. Cool. Cool.

365
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:47,450
Slow breathe.
Cool.

366
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:49,230
Calm. Cool.

367
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:52,160
- Cool.
- Just cricket, guys.

368
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:55,020
One needs a solid reason to fight.

369
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:57,240
Solid...
Start.

370
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,490
I told you don't go there.

371
00:22:58,570 --> 00:22:59,320
Start.

372
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,490
What?

373
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:52,030
Stop it!

374
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:54,070
Stop it!
What's going on?

375
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,320
I mean...

376
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,660
This Police uniform
is full of miracles.

377
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:08,780
Turns wild dogs into little kittens.

378
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:11,490
But I know...

379
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,820
Never seen this lot be
so friendly before.

380
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,950
No, sir. We are not fighting.

381
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:20,530
Yes, sir.
I admit she's from another country.

382
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:22,360
And we're very good looking Indians.

383
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:22,780
Yeah.

384
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,700
But, as my grandma always says...

385
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:26,620
"Love thy neighbour..."

386
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,200
He's so funny.

387
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:29,700
Listen, son.

388
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,660
I think you should be an actor.

389
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,360
- Ask why?
- Why?

390
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:35,490
Why, sir?

391
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:37,410
Because you are very
good at doing drama.

392
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:42,580
It's true, sir. We're buddies.

393
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:45,200
Yeah, ...we're all buddies.

394
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,160
But you see, her country lost today.

395
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:51,700
And she can't shut up...

396
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:53,060
Officer!

397
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,160
Sir...my friend wants you to join us.

398
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,450
- Please...join us.
- Join us, please.

399
00:24:58,530 --> 00:24:59,280
Come.

400
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:00,780
I am letting you go today

401
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:04,450
but remember...

402
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:06,660
Come on. quick.

403
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:09,070
- Come on, get out.
- Bye sir.

404
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,360
Out.

405
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:11,660
I'll kill you.

406
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,030
Clean.

407
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:16,450
The problem isn't that we lost...

408
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:18,280
...the problem is how they make
fun of us when we lose.

409
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:22,280
Yeah, and what does Virat
Kohli have that we don't.

410
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:23,660
Anushka.

411
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:24,990
Shut up, man.

412
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:27,660
Let's go. Come on.
We've already lost the match.

413
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,490
Come on, man.

414
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,740
Hey...

415
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,530
Come on. Hurry up.

416
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,160
- Come on.
- Inayat, let's go.

417
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:41,160
Let's go.

418
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:10,140
She's in?

419
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:21,200
Alright, let's go.

420
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:00,280
- Good job. Nice one.
- Good job, guys.

421
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:02,660
Yeah man, so good.

422
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:05,360
- I'll just be back, one second.
- Hey, that was amazing.

423
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:07,410
Babe!

424
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:08,700
Looking nice.

425
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:12,160
What are you doing here?

426
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,490
How long have you been here?

427
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:14,790
- I... I just came here.
- Come on.

428
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:16,840
- That routine was sick.
- I know.

429
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,820
Listen Boo.

430
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,390
Do you know what
happened with me today?

431
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:20,950
You fought with her again.

432
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:24,570
Yeah...but, what else can
you expect from a Punjabi Indian?

433
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:26,200
She pisses me off, man.

434
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:28,660
I just want
to defeat Inayat and her gang.

435
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:31,490
They behave like
they own the streets.

436
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,110
But you have your own studio.

437
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,530
Why are you dancing in the streets?

438
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:36,490
- Hi...
- But battles happen on the streets.

439
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:37,410
Yeah.

440
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:40,910
Listen...your team's so tough.

441
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:43,610
If we can be even
half as good as you guys...

442
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:45,660
...then I am sure we can
defeat Inayat and her team.

443
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,160
Can you train my team, please baby?

444
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,660
See, that's wrong.

445
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:50,950
What's wrong?

446
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:54,950
Sahej. Every time a dancer dances,
they compete with themselves.

447
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:55,860
Not others.

448
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:57,610
I can clearly see it...

449
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:59,360
- You want to prove...
- Hi...

450
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:00,910
You want to prove that
you're better than her.

451
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:02,660
That's not it.

452
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,360
Fine, that's how it is.

453
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:05,950
Her failure is my victory.

454
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:09,700
I want to break the pride
that reflects in her big brown eyes.

455
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:11,660
Okay, what's the colour of my eyes?

456
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:13,360
Its...

457
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:18,780
It's blackish, greyish,
a tinge of bluish.

458
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:20,570
Cream and...

459
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:22,610
Wow! Really?

460
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:25,110
- No, baby, actually I never noticed.
- Clearly.

461
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,450
Love is colour blind.

462
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:30,580
No, I mean...I know the
rest of your body parts.

463
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:33,360
In fact,
I know what colour is your top.

464
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:37,030
In fact, today you really
showed your true colours.

465
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:38,570
Don't call me.

466
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:39,860
- Bye.
- Baby...

467
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,360
- Boo Boo...
- Great.

468
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:43,700
Bravo, my man.

469
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:48,780
You mean you still don't know
the colour of your "Boo Boo's" eyes.

470
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:51,660
Where else do you look
except for in her eyes?

471
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:53,030
Come on, bro.

472
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:54,200
Nonsense.

473
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:57,110
D bro...honestly speaking,
she is so beautiful...

474
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,570
...that I get busy checking her out,
instead of looking in her eyes.

475
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:02,580
But now her eyes have opened...

476
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:05,490
...and now she's giving me an eye
for an eye in front of the London Eye.

477
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:08,700
An eye for an Eye, let's go for Bai.

478
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:09,830
What's wrong with him?

479
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:10,660
What Bai?

480
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:14,200
I know a maid who lives
in my neighbourhood.

481
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:16,240
I can put in a good
word for you if you like.

482
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:20,200
- Bro...
- Shut up.

483
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,110
Guys.

484
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:24,660
Boo Boo...

485
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:27,070
- Don't you want to rehearse?
- Boo Boo...

486
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:33,700
You're doing this for me, Boo Boo.

487
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:36,530
No Boo Boo, I am doing
it for your light brown eyes.

488
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,950
"Boo Boo... Boo Boo... Boo Boo..."

489
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:44,570
"What's the colour of her eyes..."

490
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:46,200
"What's the colour of her eyes..."

491
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:48,740
"He doesn't know what's the colour..."

492
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,950
"...what kind of a lover."

493
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:53,320
"But I love you, Boo Boo."

494
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:55,570
"I truly love you, Boo Boo."

495
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:59,660
"Lovers like me are very few."

496
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:01,660
"I love you."

497
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:07,200
- "Boo Boo... Boo Boo... Boo Boo..."
- Let's go.

498
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,540
5... 6... 7... 8...

499
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:24,610
"Your eyes cast a spell, sweetheart."

500
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:29,660
"You rock the entire place
with your moves."

501
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:34,660
"The boys jaws drop..."

502
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:37,700
"The boys jaws drop..."

503
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:40,200
"...when you smile."

504
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:42,740
"Where do you come from..."

505
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:45,160
"...tell me, sweetheart."

506
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,070
"You look..."

507
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:53,660
"You look like you're from Lahore..."

508
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,200
"...the way you smile."

509
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:58,660
"You look like you're from Punjab..."

510
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,410
"...the way you stare at me."

511
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:03,740
"You look like you're from Lahore..."

512
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,490
"...the way you smile."

513
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:11,410
"Can someone find out
where she comes from."

514
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:13,740
"You look like you're from Lahore..."

515
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:16,410
"...the way you smile."

516
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,950
"You look like you're from Punjab..."

517
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:21,480
"...the way you stare at me."

518
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:25,740
"Her attitude..."

519
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:30,610
"...and her unique style."

520
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:36,700
"You Don't impress me, sweetheart."

521
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,610
"No matter how hard you try..."

522
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,780
"...but you can never convince me."

523
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:45,410
"I am not your type..."

524
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:49,870
"I am not your type..."

525
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:52,070
"...trust me, sweetheart."

526
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:56,950
"Is there anything else left to say,
sweetheart."

527
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,280
"Shoots..."

528
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:04,410
"Shoots from her eyes..."

529
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:07,030
"...but loves me too."

530
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:09,570
"You look like you're from Lahore..."

531
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:12,070
"...the way you smile."

532
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,490
"You look like you're from Punjab..."

533
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:16,990
"...the way you stare at me."

534
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,240
"Find out..."

535
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:21,950
"Find out..."

536
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:24,410
"Find out..."

537
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:26,950
"Find out..."

538
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,460
I can guarantee you one thing...

539
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,820
If Imam-Ul-Haq sits it out tomorrow...

540
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,660
...then Pakistan is
definitely going to win.

541
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:38,910
Wow, Inu sis, how did you do it?

542
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:41,240
Takes a lot of practice.

543
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:44,240
I can do this too.

544
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,250
Takes a lot of practice.
Not without it.

545
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:48,030
Uncle's coming.

546
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:49,280
Inu, dad's coming.

547
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:50,530
Hey kids.

548
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:51,660
What are you guys, watching?

549
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:54,280
- Cartoons.
- Just cartoons.

550
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:56,200
Okay.

551
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,450
Play it again, please.

552
00:33:58,530 --> 00:33:59,990
Sushi, India's going to blast
everyone out of the ground today.

553
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:01,780
Bro, Pakistan is bowling first.

554
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:02,820
We've Virat.

555
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:05,660
D...let's go. Let's go,
the Finals are about to begin.

556
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:06,240
Come on.

557
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:06,990
- Let's go.
- Can I go?

558
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:09,070
It's the finals.
India Vs. Pakistan.

559
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,160
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

560
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,610
It's a bouncy track, bro.
Shikhar will crush them.

561
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:14,950
Keep it back, you'll break it.

562
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:17,910
- Let's go.
- Move it. Move it.

563
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,410
India's will be on a roll tonight.

564
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:22,450
- Glutton.
- Hail Mother India.

565
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:23,110
Ask Sushi.

566
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,160
Pass me as well.

567
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:27,610
Come on, let's go, let's go.

568
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:30,360
India. India.

569
00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:33,450
India. India...

570
00:34:34,410 --> 00:34:36,450
Before firing begins at the border...

571
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:38,280
...I am here to declare a ceasefire.

572
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:41,030
We're all going to watch
the match today peacefully.

573
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:41,780
Understand.

574
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:42,820
Okay.

575
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:44,030
- Sit.
- Sit.

576
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:48,820
Sir.
Anna, my lace.

577
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,410
Tie it.

578
00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:55,410
Chill, guys. Let's focus on the match.

579
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:56,410
Come on. Come on.

580
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,110
No worries.

581
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:58,990
Come on. Come on.

582
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:00,490
Come on. Come on. Come on, boys.

583
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:01,700
And match...

584
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:03,410
Waiting for the first ball...

585
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,780
That's a fantastic shot.

586
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:10,360
Sir is on our team?

587
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,490
Are you on our team?
Great.

588
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:13,200
- What?
- Sir...

589
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,360
This is not fair.

590
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:15,860
Great.

591
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:17,660
Unbelievable, sir.
You're on their side.

592
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,860
Yeah...

593
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:28,250
Bro...look at that.

594
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:29,620
- I had told him earlier.
- What is the meaning of this?

595
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,110
Now he's cheering us.

596
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:33,490
What are you all watching?

597
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:34,820
Fine, let me explain.

598
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:36,700
My mom was from India,
and father from Pakistan.

599
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:38,780
Between Father-Mother...
Mother and father...

600
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:40,910
...I am getting screwed.
S*** happens.

601
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:42,070
You guys enjoy the match.

602
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:43,070
Sit.

603
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,410
What a weird guy?

604
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:46,240
Relax, guys.

605
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,110
Chotu.

606
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:48,410

Four burgers.

00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,030
I'll have two.

618
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:00,990
Jolly good.

Doughnut.

Get 6 doughnuts,
and bring our order first.

00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:23,950
Understood.

One more. One more.

639
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:47,110
Four.

640
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,160
Losers.

641
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,160
India! India!

642
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:54,780
Calm down.

643
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:56,770
And oh my, God.

644
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:02,030
- Oh no.
- Come on, keep the form.

645
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:02,990
Yes.

646
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:04,490
What are they doing?

647
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,240
Trying to field on the left...

648
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,860
Run. Run. Run.

649
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:10,320
- Run.
- Just got saved. Bravo.

650
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:12,070
Well done, my boy. Run.

00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,610
Nick of time.

652
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,240
Nick of time.

653
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,160
Come on.

654
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,700
Everyone holding hands.

655
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:19,990
Last ball, pin drop silence.

656
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:22,360
No one knows what's going to happen.

657
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:23,990
Everyone's tensed.

658
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:25,360
Everyone looks worried.

659
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:26,620
Let's see what happens.

660
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,030
Two runs required of one ball."

661
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:29,570
Come on. Come on. Please, please...

662
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:31,360
And that's a four.

663
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:34,280
What a shot!

664
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:35,410
Yeah...

665
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:37,170
Come on.

666
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:44,860
Hey, why are you pushing me?

667
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:46,820
- What the hell! Stop pushing.
- No, no...

668
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:50,530
No, no...stop, stop...
No fighting. No fighting.

669
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:53,610
Sir...no fighting,
but dancing is allowed.

670
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:54,490
Officer.

671
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:55,660
Sir, no...

676
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:11,490
"I am gonna break the floor tonight."

677
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:15,410
"I am gonna break the floor tonight."

678
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:19,160
"I am in the mood for some dancing..."

679
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:22,530
"I am in a hardcore mood to dance."

680
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:24,860
"I am gonna break the floor tonight."

681
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:28,740
"I am gonna break the floor tonight."

682
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:33,070
"Come on the dance floor
and show me your flow..."

683
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:36,660
"...if you got what it takes to."

684
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:40,570
"Come on the dance floor

685
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:43,410
"...if you got what it takes to."

686
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:45,660
"I have no worries..."

687
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:47,570
"...cause this is my area."

688
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:49,450
"I am a bomb and you're a cracker."

689
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:51,950
"I am not scared of anyone."

690
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:55,660
"So baby...let's go."

691
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:59,450
"Keep dancing...dancing...dancing...."

"Shake...shake...shake it like me."

695
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:21,100
"Gonna give
all your trash talk right back."

696
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:24,870
"Gonna get in your area, and hi-jack."

697
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:28,620
"Gonna give
all your trash talk right back."

698
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:32,640
"Gonna get in your area, and hi-jack."

699
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:34,540
"Your baby's got his eyes on me."

700
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:36,280
"He's getting edgy."

701
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:37,950
"I'll give him my heart..."

702
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:40,660
"...and give you a heart attack."

703
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:44,410
"Keep dancing...dancing...dancing...."

"Keep dancing...dancing...dancing...."

707
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,500
"Hey.. Come on.."

708
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:04,200
"Careless... Carefree..."

709
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,110
"Baby's dancing on the floor alone..."

710
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,700
"...and making the Dj's head spin."

711
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:10,030
"She is pretty insane."

712
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:11,950
"Wonder what's her diet..."

713
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:15,200
"...is beyond what I can understand."

714
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:19,030
"Everyone knows that she
wants to get high tonight."

715
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:23,120
"The way she's moving, she
won't stop until the floor's broken."

716
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,740
"She won't give up until
she's shown all her moves tonight."

717
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:28,450
"Someone introduce me..."

718
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:30,280
"...bring her to me."

719
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:34,030
"She will make my heart
explode with her moves."

720
00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:34,740
"Baby..."

721
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:38,280
"Keep dancing...dancing...dancing...."

722
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:42,320
"Keep dancing...dancing...dancing...."

723
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:46,070
"Keep dancing...dancing...dancing...."

724
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:49,910
"Keep dancing...dancing...dancing...."

725
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:03,880
- Very nice. Very nice.
- What happened?

726
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,490
You guys wanted to see something new.

727
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:07,110
This was new.

728
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:08,820
How was it?

729
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,410
And you know what...

730
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:11,910
Even we have better things to do.

731
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:14,450
Anna, we're going to
pay their bill as well.

732
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:17,370
India has won. Chill, our treat.

733
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:18,730
Enough.
You guys finished dancing?

734
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:20,470
Now back to your homes. Come on.

735
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:25,700
- India. India. India. India.
- Come on.

736
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:26,860
Love you, Anna.

737
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:28,280
- You guys too.
- India. India.

738
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,240
Zain, we'll deal with
them some other day.

739
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:31,780
- Today is a bad day.
- I'll leave too?

740
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:33,330
- Thank you.
- Okay, bye.

741
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:34,320
Let's go.

742
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:35,500
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

743
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:36,780
Guys, this is not fair.

744
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:38,940
We lost the match
and we lost the dance battle.

745
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:40,940
Inu.

746
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:42,690
Your phone.

747
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:43,820
You left it inside.

748
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:48,320
Let's go. Let's go.

749
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:29,650
Chotu, ready.

750
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,580
What's going on here?

751
00:42:37,370 --> 00:42:40,200
Do you guys do something illegal
here after the restaurant shuts down?

752
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:43,580
- Does your boss know about this?
- Chotu, fill up the boxes.

753
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:45,120
Fast.

754
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,580
Has everyone eaten? Let's go.

755
00:42:47,830 --> 00:42:48,790
Hello.

756
00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:51,250
Don't try to change the topic
or I'll call the cops right now.

757
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:53,120
What illegal activity
is going on here?

758
00:42:53,290 --> 00:42:55,660
Yes...I am doing something illegal.

759
00:42:56,370 --> 00:42:59,830
I repack the food that
you guys waste and feed them.

760
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:05,580
That's the illegal thing I am doing.

761
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,160
Say thank you.

762
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:10,580
She paid for the food
which you guys are eating.

763
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:14,160
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

764
00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:16,830
What are you looking at?

765
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,000
These are our people.

766
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Some ours, and some yours.

767
00:43:35,950 --> 00:43:38,000
Even though they are
all from different countries...

768
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:40,250
...there is just one thing
that binds them.

769
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:43,040
Their helplessness.

770
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:50,910
You guys are always fighting over
nationality, cricket, and religion.

771
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:53,370
They are fighting too.

772
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:55,790
But together.

773
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,500
Only for survival.

774
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:09,370
They don't even know where their
next meal will come from, or how.

775
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,200
Would you like to know more?

776
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:23,370
But the reality is very different.

777
00:44:23,450 --> 00:44:27,080
No jobs, no future, no money...

778
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:30,250
Living on the streets,
parched and starving and cold.

779
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,700
Always on the run and
hiding from the Police.

780
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:37,370
Even I know that giving them food is only
a temporary solution to their problem.

781
00:44:37,830 --> 00:44:39,580
But their problems will end...

782
00:44:40,370 --> 00:44:44,140
...when they go back to their
countries, back to their home.

783
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:28,160
Inu, you could've at least
called to say that you'll be late.

784
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:30,370
You must have already had dinner.

785
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:31,700
No, mom.

786
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:35,580
I am going to eat my fill tonight.

787
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:44,910
Do let me know, okay.

788
00:46:45,370 --> 00:46:47,000
Right, keep us posted.

789
00:46:52,190 --> 00:46:53,910
Sir, if I know something
I'll inform you.

790
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:54,540
Yes.

791
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:55,500
- Let's go.
- Alright.

792
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:58,750
- Thank you, sir.
- Cheers.

793
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:02,290
Sahej. Sahej.

794
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:04,000
What were the cops doing here?

795
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:05,330
What happened?

796
00:47:05,450 --> 00:47:06,330
Nothing, bro.

797
00:47:06,410 --> 00:47:07,290
Remember my trip to Punjab.

798
00:47:07,370 --> 00:47:09,000
- Yeah.
- They are inquiring about it.

799
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:10,580
What happened in Punjab?

800
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:12,750
Nothing.

801
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:14,450
I went to Punjab to
attend Goldie's wedding.

802
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:15,410
You know how it is.

803
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:17,370
Singing-dancing, orchestra.

804
00:47:17,450 --> 00:47:19,080
All that big-fat Indian wedding.

805
00:47:19,370 --> 00:47:21,700
But the main attraction
was these drummers.

806
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:23,450
They were too good.

807
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:25,920
I got goosebumps.
International stuff.

808
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:29,370
But they had a shady manager.

809
00:47:29,450 --> 00:47:30,580
Mr. Chawla.

810
00:47:30,950 --> 00:47:32,450
He just wanted to drink.

811
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:36,950
- Here you go.
- It's all done...

812
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:37,790
Here you go.

813
00:47:37,950 --> 00:47:39,080
At least add some water.

814
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:42,040
Our mouth automatically starts
watering at the sight of alcohol.

815
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:43,750
What else do you want to add?

816
00:47:43,830 --> 00:47:44,620
Wait.

817
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:45,830
Calm down.

818
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:46,830
Be patient.

819
00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:48,700
By the way,
guys, you all are very talented.

820
00:47:48,790 --> 00:47:50,620
- You guys play really well.
- Thank you, brother.

821
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:52,580
They are very talented boys.

822
00:47:53,290 --> 00:47:55,660
But...no respect.

823
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:58,660
And look at you.
You went abroad.

824
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:02,830
And you're running your
brother's dance group so nicely.

825
00:48:02,910 --> 00:48:03,290
Yeah.

826
00:48:03,370 --> 00:48:04,250
Admirable.

827
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:06,250
Brother and I are not different.

828
00:48:06,330 --> 00:48:06,870
See...

829
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:10,960
This generosity...everyone
doesn't have it.

830
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,000
Not at all.

831
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:17,200
In fact, in my advice only you
can give these boys a better future.

832
00:48:17,290 --> 00:48:18,540
- Yes... Yes...
- Me?

833
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:19,120
Yes...

834
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:20,000
But how?

835
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:20,830
Brother...

836
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:22,660
Take them to London.

837
00:48:22,750 --> 00:48:23,540
London?

838
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:24,330
Yeah...

839
00:48:24,410 --> 00:48:26,160
It's not hard at all.

840
00:48:26,450 --> 00:48:31,950
All you have to say is they
are musicians of your dance group.

841
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:33,540
- Drummers.
- That's all. That's all.

842
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:35,080
You can drop them off at the airport.

843
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:36,830
Everything can be arranged.

844
00:48:36,910 --> 00:48:38,040
There's no dearth of work.

845
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:39,080
- Right.
- You tell him.

846
00:48:39,290 --> 00:48:41,120
We won't give you
a reason to complain.

847
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:43,540
I sure someone helped
your family to get there too.

848
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:47,120
Brother, I admit that your
lives will change for good in London.

849
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:47,610
Yes...

850
00:48:47,690 --> 00:48:48,750
But I'll get in trouble.

851
00:48:48,950 --> 00:48:50,750
- It's risky, and frankly illegal.
- Bro..

852
00:48:50,830 --> 00:48:52,160
And I am not some travel agent.

853
00:48:52,250 --> 00:48:53,580
I only came here
to attend this wedding.

854
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:55,000
- But...
- Thanks.

855
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,040
What's wrong? Come on, let's go.

856
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:57,250
Let's talk. Let's talk.

857
00:48:57,330 --> 00:48:58,580
Brother, please, come on.

858
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:00,690
- I'll do something.
- Please.

859
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:03,330
Stop blaming me.

860
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:04,540
Fine, brother.

861
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:05,380
I am trying.

862
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:08,780
Don't ask me.
Wherever I went, they reached there.

863
00:49:24,330 --> 00:49:26,500
Hello sir. This is from tomato...
- Please taste it.

864
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:28,000
This is very tasty.

865
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:29,790
- One thing I have to tell you.
- Please... Take us.

866
00:49:29,870 --> 00:49:32,460
- They play drums very well.
- Sorry, sorry, sorry, sit, sit, sit.

867
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:34,220
- I love that.
- Are you satisfied now?

868
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:35,040
Now be quiet.

869
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:36,120
Not a word.

870
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:37,950
No one's going to talk about London.

871
00:49:38,410 --> 00:49:39,450
Eat your meal.

872
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:41,080
No one's going to talk about London.

873
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:42,580
Would you like some buttermilk?

874
00:49:43,450 --> 00:49:48,120
Son, I knew you didn't want to come...

875
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:50,410
...but you were forced to.

876
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:52,250
What is it called?

877
00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:55,250
- Here you go.
- Family formality.

878
00:49:57,250 --> 00:50:00,580
But anyway, at least you came.

879
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:06,620
You haven't completely
forgotten your motherland yet.

880
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:09,430
B to the B, BG (Grandma).

881
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:11,600
I may still have some
Indian-ness left in me,

882
00:50:11,810 --> 00:50:13,640
but the glow on the
face is from London.

883
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:14,310
I see...

884
00:50:14,390 --> 00:50:17,890
NRI is no longer Non-Resident-Indian.

885
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:20,560
It's now National Rockstar of India.

886
00:50:20,970 --> 00:50:21,390
I see...

887
00:50:21,470 --> 00:50:22,930
We even have our own home now.

888
00:50:23,390 --> 00:50:23,930
See...

889
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:25,600
See, grandma.

890
00:50:26,010 --> 00:50:26,760
That's the lawn.

891
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:27,560
Yeah.

892
00:50:27,890 --> 00:50:28,600
Brother.

893
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:29,470
See...

894
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:30,680
Your Brit daughter-in-law.

895
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:32,180
I see...

896
00:50:32,930 --> 00:50:33,760
And your son.

897
00:50:34,890 --> 00:50:37,100
And next to him is
my little brother Shadow.

898
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:38,810
You call this home?

899
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:42,640
This is a house.

900
00:50:42,970 --> 00:50:46,260
Home is when you live among family.

901
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:49,180
Look at your father.

902
00:50:49,810 --> 00:50:51,560
Even that dog doesn't care about him.

903
00:50:53,130 --> 00:50:57,060
He always thought about himself,
and not his family.

904
00:50:57,560 --> 00:51:01,470
Son, always remember one thing.

905
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:08,470
Always chanting the name
of God is not necessary.

906
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:17,640
But the moment when you help
someone is also as good as devotion.

907
00:51:28,930 --> 00:51:31,060
Grandma, you got me emotional.

908
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:34,970
Why does everyone in India
put emotion in everything?

909
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:41,970
I am feeling sleepy.

910
00:51:48,810 --> 00:51:49,850
Goodnight, grandma.

911
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,640
How many times do
I have to tell you guys?

912
00:51:57,810 --> 00:51:58,810
Don't you get it?

913
00:51:59,390 --> 00:52:01,010
Stop giving me emotional looks.

914
00:52:03,470 --> 00:52:06,350
And Mr. Chawla, that emotional
body language won't work with me.

915
00:52:07,010 --> 00:52:07,930
I can get in trouble.

916
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:10,600
We won't let you get in trouble.
Believe me.

917
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:12,060
Just help us get there.

918
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:14,890
You'll be doing a
favour to four families.

919
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:18,010
Imagine, four moms will bless
you for the rest of their lives.

920
00:52:18,090 --> 00:52:19,010
Wait a minute.

921
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:21,560
I've arranged for their jobs.

922
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:25,180
Business visas,
tickets, everything's ready.

923
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:31,510
And look Im ready to deposit 2 million
Rupees for this job in your account.

924
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:32,430
No...

925
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:36,100
Let's double the amount.

926
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:39,180
I'm willing to pay
you 4 million rupees.

927
00:52:40,180 --> 00:52:44,640
Look, Mr. Chawla, if you think I'll do
your job if you double the amount...

928
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:51,180
Then you're right.

929
00:52:54,470 --> 00:52:55,510
Money first.

930
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:57,100
I don't mind.

931
00:52:57,180 --> 00:52:58,260
Tell him to stop kissing me.

932
00:52:58,350 --> 00:52:59,850
Stop kissing him.
Stop kissing him.

933
00:52:59,930 --> 00:53:01,060
Can I kiss you?

934
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:05,470
London. London. London. London.

935
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:09,390
London. London. London.
London. London. London.

936
00:53:14,810 --> 00:53:15,470
Number 10...

937
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:16,260
Yes...

938
00:53:17,010 --> 00:53:18,970
Guys, wait. You're all going together.

939
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:20,060
How is it going, mate?

940
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:21,720
Are you all together?

941
00:53:21,810 --> 00:53:23,310
Yeah, they are with me actually.

942
00:53:23,470 --> 00:53:25,180
I am Sahej Singh from England...

943
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:28,260
...and these guys
are brilliant musicians.

944
00:53:28,350 --> 00:53:29,140
Remove the hat.

945
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:31,180
Yeah, they play and I dance.

946
00:53:31,350 --> 00:53:32,180
Street Dance.

947
00:53:32,390 --> 00:53:35,640
And sir, we're putting up
this massive extravaganza at the O2...

948
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:36,890
...or maybe the Wembly.

949
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:41,560
And...it's basically this fusion
of Hip-Hop meeting Indian folk.

950
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:48,560
London. London. London.
London. London. London.

951
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:50,720
Calm down. Calm down.

952
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:52,220
London. London. London.
London. London. London..

953
00:53:52,310 --> 00:53:53,430
Calm down, guys.

954
00:53:53,510 --> 00:53:54,560
Or else they will send everyone back.

955
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:55,970
And you stop kissing me.

956
00:53:56,260 --> 00:53:58,140
For us first there's
God and then there's you.

957
00:53:58,220 --> 00:53:59,180
I haven't done anything.

958
00:53:59,260 --> 00:54:00,220
Please don't tell anyone.

959
00:54:00,430 --> 00:54:01,970
You're an angel of God.

960
00:54:02,060 --> 00:54:03,180
Here's your pending payment.

961
00:54:03,350 --> 00:54:05,060
I forgot all about this.

962
00:54:05,310 --> 00:54:08,220
Can I borrow your phone?
I want to call my mother.

963
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:09,640
Your mother?

964
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:11,180
Why didn't you tell me earlier?
Stupid.

965
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:12,220
Here you go.

966
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:17,430
Hello.

967
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:18,760
Greetings, mom.

968
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:20,600
Amrinder speaking.

969
00:54:21,010 --> 00:54:23,180
I've reached London,
under the open sky.

970
00:54:23,390 --> 00:54:25,390
Bless you, son. Take care.

971
00:54:26,010 --> 00:54:27,640
Don't forget to call your mother.

972
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:31,470
Eat properly,
and look after the other kids as well.

973
00:54:31,970 --> 00:54:32,680
Yes.

974
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:36,010
Soon I'll get rid of all the debts.

975
00:54:36,390 --> 00:54:37,760
Don't worry.

976
00:54:37,970 --> 00:54:39,260
Just be happy and work hard.

977
00:54:39,470 --> 00:54:41,310
Listen...is this your number?

978
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:44,180
No, this is Sahej's number.
I'll soon send you my number.

979
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:46,010
- Okay, bye.
- Goobye.

980
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:48,720
Your future's will be bright.

981
00:54:49,070 --> 00:54:51,060
Everyone in fact.
This is London after all.

982
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:52,560
Have fun. Good times ahead.

983
00:54:52,810 --> 00:54:54,060
What did I do wrong?

984
00:54:54,510 --> 00:54:56,220
If I hadn't done it,
then someone else would.

985
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:57,760
Where are they now?

986
00:54:58,180 --> 00:55:00,640
We are still in touch.
Soon they will all settle down.

987
00:55:00,930 --> 00:55:02,930
But that's great.
You did a favour to them.

988
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:04,390
What are you worried for?

989
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:07,720
Look...don't tell anyone about this?

990
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:11,970
Have I ever told any of your secrets?

991
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:13,890
Relax, man.

992
00:55:14,390 --> 00:55:15,310
Come on.

993
00:55:16,970 --> 00:55:19,510
But why don't they go back home?

994
00:55:20,470 --> 00:55:22,010
Financially it's not possible.

995
00:55:22,350 --> 00:55:26,680
Plus legalising them,
paperwork, tickets, etc etc.

996
00:55:26,970 --> 00:55:28,810
But there must be
something that can be done.

997
00:55:28,890 --> 00:55:30,810
What about the local authorities?

998
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:33,640
It's not that the UK government
doesn't want to help.

999
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:35,760
But it's a long process.

1000
00:55:35,890 --> 00:55:40,260
And I am talking not less
than 3000 immigrants in our area.

1001
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:43,600
We don't have that kind of money.

1002
00:55:48,570 --> 00:55:50,220
Bro, you know what?

1003
00:55:50,390 --> 00:55:51,890
- Thank you.
- You guys are the best team.

1004
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:52,970
Big brother...

1005
00:55:53,890 --> 00:55:57,350
I think you should give
me a gift on your birthday.

1006
00:55:57,640 --> 00:55:58,760
- Me?
- What?

1007
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:01,310
- Get a GF.
- GF?

1008
00:56:01,510 --> 00:56:02,970
Girlfriend.
Homely Friend.

1009
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:05,470
Someone who will take
care of you when you grow old.

1010
00:56:05,930 --> 00:56:08,100
What are you saying?
What GF?

1011
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:09,010
What else do you want?

1012
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:11,060
You're always standing
in a corner and sulking.

1013
00:56:11,180 --> 00:56:13,510
Sahej, on a serious note,
will you give me something I want?

1014
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:15,180
We've everything we want.

1015
00:56:15,470 --> 00:56:16,760
You always wanted a studio,
now we have one.

1016
00:56:16,850 --> 00:56:18,470
You wanted a crew,
and now we have a Street Dancer crew.

1017
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:21,180
Followers on Instagram,
likes on Facebook...

1018
00:56:23,010 --> 00:56:24,060
This is what I want.

1019
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:27,850
Ground Zero.

1020
00:56:28,010 --> 00:56:28,720
Yes, Ground Zero.

1021
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:30,720
But this is where...

1022
00:56:30,890 --> 00:56:36,180
I know things didn't go
well the last time I participated.

1023
00:56:36,890 --> 00:56:38,260
My dream couldn't be fulfilled.

1024
00:56:39,350 --> 00:56:40,640
But now I have you.

1025
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:45,100
Sahej, will you fulfil my dream?

1026
00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:47,890
Will you fulfil your brother's dream?

1027
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:50,890
We got to win.

1028
00:56:52,550 --> 00:56:53,220
Guys...

1029
00:56:53,430 --> 00:56:55,390
- Guys, everyone, come here.
- Guys, guys, fast... Come here.

1030
00:56:55,470 --> 00:56:56,220
- Come, guys.
- What happened?

1031
00:56:56,310 --> 00:56:56,980
- Yes.
- Yes.

1032
00:56:57,060 --> 00:57:02,010
Guys, this year Street
Dancer crew will win Ground Zero.

1033
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:05,720
We will do it.

1034
00:57:05,810 --> 00:57:06,720
Let's do it.

1035
00:57:06,810 --> 00:57:07,850
- We love you.
- Let's do it.

1036
00:57:07,930 --> 00:57:08,970
- Let's do it.
- We're gonna do it.

1037
00:57:11,390 --> 00:57:12,600
Yes...

1038
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:17,850
Guys, the coffees are here.

1039
00:57:17,930 --> 00:57:20,430
Come on, do your move.

1040
00:57:21,350 --> 00:57:21,970
Thank you, buddy.

1041
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:24,100
Hey, guys, come here.

1042
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:25,600
Ground Zero Event is back.

1043
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:26,640
Are you serious?

1044
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:27,470
Yeah.

1045
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:29,810
Qualifies are in October.

1046
00:57:30,430 --> 00:57:31,010
That's now.

1047
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:32,810
- Inu...Ground Zero.
- That's now.

1048
00:57:32,890 --> 00:57:34,350
Guys, relax.
Not possible.

1049
00:57:34,430 --> 00:57:35,700
- Guess, what is prize money?
- Inu...

1050
00:57:35,930 --> 00:57:36,470
How much?

1051
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:37,390
- How much?
- How much?

1052
00:57:37,510 --> 00:57:38,760
100,000 pounds.

1053
00:57:39,890 --> 00:57:40,470
What?

1054
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:41,930
Bro, that's crazy.

1055
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:53,180
100,000 pounds! Imagine
the number of people we can help.

1056
00:57:53,390 --> 00:57:54,600
If the prize money is so huge...

1057
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:56,390
...you can imagine the
level of competition as well.

1058
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:57,350
I know...

1059
00:57:57,560 --> 00:58:00,010
The best of the best teams from
all over the world compete for it.

1060
00:58:00,260 --> 00:58:01,640
And you feel you can win.

1061
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:03,890
Of course sir, we have the best team.

1062
00:58:11,180 --> 00:58:12,600
The Ground Zero Event.

1063
00:58:14,170 --> 00:58:17,100
Here, Rules are only
meant to be broken.

1064
00:58:17,180 --> 00:58:18,100
There are judges...

1065
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:20,760
...but only the
audience gets to decide.

1066
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:23,890
So no rules, no jury, only fury.

1067
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:28,890
The world's top teams and dancers
come here every year to compete.

1068
00:58:29,140 --> 00:58:30,720
Only the best of the best qualify.

1069
00:58:30,930 --> 00:58:32,810
But only the craziest team wins.

1070
00:58:32,970 --> 00:58:36,720
So welcome to the Ground Zero Mania.

1071
00:58:50,390 --> 00:58:52,310
This is big, bro.

1072
00:59:25,110 --> 00:59:28,640
Bro, look. That's Inayat right there.

1073
00:59:31,230 --> 00:59:33,100
Come on, boys. Let's go, let's go.

1074
00:59:33,180 --> 00:59:34,440
Come on.

1075
00:59:35,970 --> 00:59:37,220
Yahoo!

1076
00:59:39,010 --> 00:59:40,470
You can beat them.

1077
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:42,060
Hey...

1078
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:44,970
Ladies and Gentlemen,
hold your hearts.

1079
00:59:45,180 --> 00:59:48,010
Because the breaking news
is that Street Dancer crew...

1080
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:51,970
...are participating in
the Ground Zero competition.

1081
00:59:52,140 --> 00:59:56,510
And this news has made the
Rule-Breakers restless and ticklish...

1082
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:59,060
...and uneasy to the core.

1083
00:59:59,140 --> 01:00:02,180
Call it embarrassment or superfluity.

1084
01:00:02,260 --> 01:00:06,010
All I can say is,
Take it easy Urvashi.

1085
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:08,180
No violence got it.

1086
01:00:09,260 --> 01:00:11,350
If you wise guys want to
see yourself getting humiliated...

1087
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:13,600
...then you must take
part in this competition.

1088
01:00:15,930 --> 01:00:17,220
You're right.

1089
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:21,760
We all know Inayat cannot win.

1090
01:00:22,930 --> 01:00:24,390
And it's also true...

1091
01:00:26,180 --> 01:00:27,560
that you can't win either.

1092
01:00:28,060 --> 01:00:29,930
But if you guys team-up...

1093
01:00:31,810 --> 01:00:33,640
Then you can blow
away your competition.

1094
01:00:34,580 --> 01:00:38,220
Physics says two negatives
make one positive.

1095
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:44,060
Economics says, rather than
making a loss, share the profit.

1096
01:00:44,260 --> 01:00:48,810
And Moral Science says,
united we stand and divided we fall.

1097
01:00:49,430 --> 01:00:55,640
History also says...these guys
left India when we all stood together.

1098
01:01:07,490 --> 01:01:08,890
With this guy...

1099
01:01:10,140 --> 01:01:10,930
Never.

1100
01:01:12,010 --> 01:01:14,470
So, you think I am dying to join you?

1101
01:01:14,810 --> 01:01:17,810
We can...never be one.

1102
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:21,430
Never!

1103
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:30,220
And the undisputed champions.

1104
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:36,890
Ladies and Gentlemen, The Royals.

1105
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:50,160
Aunty, the phone's ringing.

1106
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:51,580
- It is?
- I am going to play.

1107
01:01:51,660 --> 01:01:52,580
Hello.

1108
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:53,740
Hello.

1109
01:01:53,990 --> 01:01:56,080
Is this Sahej speaking?

1110
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:57,540
Yes, who is this?

1111
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:01,830
Son, this is Amrinder's mother.

1112
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:03,740
Is he with you?

1113
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:05,290
No, he's not with me.

1114
01:02:06,150 --> 01:02:09,490
If there's a problem,
then please speak with Mr. Chawla.

1115
01:02:09,770 --> 01:02:11,740
I am not responsible for him, okay.

1116
01:02:11,820 --> 01:02:13,290
Don't ever call on this number again.

1117
01:02:13,510 --> 01:02:15,870
Son, if you can provide
me with a number...

1118
01:02:17,890 --> 01:02:21,260
- Sister, is everything alright?
- Hello.

1119
01:02:21,340 --> 01:02:23,360
What's wrong?
Why are you crying?

1120
01:02:28,830 --> 01:02:29,540
Hi...

1121
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:30,870
Hi, Purnima, how are you?

1122
01:02:30,950 --> 01:02:32,120
Come on, we're getting late.

1123
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:32,660
Catch you later.

1124
01:02:32,740 --> 01:02:33,160
Who is she?

1125
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:34,080
Purnima.

1126
01:02:34,370 --> 01:02:36,480
A white beauty with a dark knight,
isn't it a rare sight, boys?

1127
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:38,660
I am handsome.
Brown beauty.

1128
01:02:38,740 --> 01:02:39,410
Sorry.

1129
01:02:39,580 --> 01:02:41,330
Why are you guys always late?

1130
01:02:41,410 --> 01:02:43,260
Why are you guys always late?

1131
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:45,330
Let's go, everyone.

1132
01:02:45,410 --> 01:02:46,910
Sushi, let's go.

1133
01:02:46,990 --> 01:02:48,450
Baby, why are you always late?

1134
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:02,230
Bro, can you play a music.

1135
01:03:09,940 --> 01:03:11,490
Poddy.

1136
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:22,330
"Someone turn up the AC."

1137
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:26,220
"This is going to be fun, bro."

1138
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:29,310
"Let's begin."

1139
01:03:32,510 --> 01:03:34,760
"Everything looks fake..."

1140
01:03:34,850 --> 01:03:36,850
"...whenever around
you I hit the brakes."

1141
01:03:36,970 --> 01:03:39,140
"I keep my distance from you,
sweetheart..."

1142
01:03:39,220 --> 01:03:41,140
"...starts getting
hotter the closer I get."

1143
01:03:41,220 --> 01:03:45,720
"The temperature's soaring
and it's hit the roof."

1144
01:03:45,890 --> 01:03:49,850
"Poor beloved covered in sweat."

1145
01:03:50,010 --> 01:03:52,140
"This is so unfair..."

1146
01:03:52,220 --> 01:03:54,180
"...baby, you are so heartless."

1147
01:03:54,260 --> 01:03:56,850
"Even in this winter,"

1148
01:03:56,930 --> 01:03:58,680
"it feels like..."
"Feels like..."

1149
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:01,060
"Feels like..."

1150
01:04:04,010 --> 01:04:05,310
"So hot..."

1151
01:04:08,350 --> 01:04:09,220
"So hot..."

1152
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:14,010
"So hot..."

1153
01:04:17,050 --> 01:04:18,140
"So hot..."

1154
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:23,560
"December feels like summer."

1155
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:25,760
"You're Lamborgini and I am Hummer."

1156
01:04:25,930 --> 01:04:27,890
"There is no hurry, baby..."

1157
01:04:27,970 --> 01:04:30,310
"Because I've always
been a latecomer."

1158
01:04:30,390 --> 01:04:32,430
"You are a billion in one..."

1159
01:04:32,510 --> 01:04:34,640
"Your waist shakes like a snake."

1160
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:39,020
"I can write an essay on
your beauty without taking a break."

1161
01:04:39,100 --> 01:04:41,140
"Getting to the point..."

1162
01:04:41,220 --> 01:04:43,350
"...you're going to make me wait."

1163
01:04:43,430 --> 01:04:45,350
"If you want to feel
what hotness feels like..."

1164
01:04:45,430 --> 01:04:48,010
"...then take me in your embrace."

1165
01:04:48,470 --> 01:04:50,510
"Don't look away..."

1166
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:52,680
"...and give me a heartbreak."

1167
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:54,640
"In this red dress..."

1168
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:57,140
"...you look just
like a red velvet cake."

1169
01:04:57,220 --> 01:05:01,430
"Many like you have
been heartbroken before."

1170
01:05:01,510 --> 01:05:05,600
"Romeos have put their
life for me at stake."

1171
01:05:05,890 --> 01:05:08,010
"This is so unfair..."

1172
01:05:08,100 --> 01:05:10,100
"Even in this winter, you made it..."

1173
01:05:10,180 --> 01:05:13,010
"Made it..."
"Made it..."

1174
01:05:13,810 --> 01:05:14,510
"So hot..."

1175
01:05:18,170 --> 01:05:19,060
"So hot..."

1176
01:05:22,470 --> 01:05:23,440
"So hot..."

1177
01:05:26,850 --> 01:05:27,760
"So hot..."

1178
01:05:31,220 --> 01:05:32,010
"So hot..."

1179
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:36,640
"So hot..."

1180
01:05:39,980 --> 01:05:40,640
"So hot..."

1181
01:05:44,310 --> 01:05:45,650
"So hot..."

1182
01:06:12,540 --> 01:06:13,730
"So hot..."

1183
01:06:17,050 --> 01:06:18,390
"So hot..."

1184
01:06:21,350 --> 01:06:22,630
"So hot..."

1185
01:06:44,470 --> 01:06:45,740
"So hot..."

1186
01:06:55,370 --> 01:06:56,770
"So hot..."

1187
01:06:59,710 --> 01:07:00,830
"So hot..."

1188
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:51,370
- Sushi...
- Yo...alright.

1189
01:07:51,460 --> 01:07:52,210
Back up.

1190
01:07:52,370 --> 01:07:53,120
Sushi...

1191
01:07:53,290 --> 01:07:54,240
That was nice, man.

1192
01:07:55,030 --> 01:07:56,200
- Thanks, mate.
- Alright.

1193
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:58,490
But if you want to be the best...

1194
01:07:58,860 --> 01:08:00,200
...come and train with my crew.

1195
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:00,740
Yeah.

1196
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:03,660
So you, you, you and you.

1197
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:05,320
See you tomorrow, yeah.

1198
01:08:05,950 --> 01:08:07,370
- Let's go, man.
- What did he say?

1199
01:08:07,450 --> 01:08:08,320
What did he say?

1200
01:08:08,610 --> 01:08:09,610
What happened?

1201
01:08:10,700 --> 01:08:11,860
Poddy, Royals.

1202
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:13,570
What are you doing, man?

1203
01:08:13,780 --> 01:08:14,900
They selected us.

1204
01:08:15,170 --> 01:08:16,470
They're good dancers, man.

1205
01:08:17,070 --> 01:08:18,530
- They should be with us, not against us.
- Sushi...

1206
01:08:18,610 --> 01:08:19,530
Yeah, whatever.

1207
01:08:20,340 --> 01:08:21,610
Did you check out his move?

1208
01:08:21,780 --> 01:08:22,740
It was great.

1209
01:08:22,820 --> 01:08:24,660
- Inu, let's go. Getting late.
- Yeah, that's what I am saying.

1210
01:08:24,910 --> 01:08:28,360
Inu...I hope you're not too
serious about the competition?

1211
01:08:29,700 --> 01:08:30,280
I guess she is.

1212
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:33,200
I am because I have a serious reason.

1213
01:08:46,860 --> 01:08:48,670
Here you go.
Eat your fill.

1214
01:08:50,750 --> 01:08:52,950
Hey guys, shall I start from here.

1215
01:08:53,910 --> 01:08:56,280
One packet for each, okay.

1216
01:09:02,610 --> 01:09:03,660
- Hello.
- Thank you.

1217
01:09:03,740 --> 01:09:04,740
Where are you two from?

1218
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:06,320
Your house?

1219
01:09:06,610 --> 01:09:08,240
House? Sri Lanka.

1220
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:09,240
Sri Lanka.

1221
01:09:09,820 --> 01:09:10,610
And you?

1222
01:09:10,950 --> 01:09:12,490
I am from Karachi, son.

1223
01:09:12,950 --> 01:09:13,830
Karachi.

1224
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:15,280
Even I am from Karachi.

1225
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:16,610
That's great.

1226
01:09:18,090 --> 01:09:22,950
It's been ages since
I last went back home.

1227
01:09:23,450 --> 01:09:24,740
When did you last go there?

1228
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:27,990
Well, sir.
We grew up here.

1229
01:09:28,780 --> 01:09:31,740
- And frankly speaking, I never had the...
- I speak English.

1230
01:09:33,150 --> 01:09:38,240
Never had the intention of
going there, and never felt the need.

1231
01:09:38,820 --> 01:09:40,320
Isn't this weird, son?

1232
01:09:41,610 --> 01:09:46,450
You can go to your country
whenever you want, but you don't.

1233
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:48,240
And us...

1234
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:52,320
We want to go, but we can't.

1235
01:09:52,990 --> 01:09:56,270
We left the country
that gave us everything.

1236
01:09:56,990 --> 01:09:58,160
But, thank you anyway, son.

1237
01:09:58,910 --> 01:09:59,720
Thank you.

1238
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:01,780
May God bless you.

1239
01:10:01,860 --> 01:10:02,610
So be it.

1240
01:10:02,700 --> 01:10:03,750
God bless.

1241
01:10:03,990 --> 01:10:05,510
I'll get some more.

1242
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:09,820
Inu.

1243
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:12,740
Thank you.

1244
01:10:13,730 --> 01:10:15,680
We finally understand
why you brought us here.

1245
01:10:16,990 --> 01:10:20,770
And sir, dancing for
yourself is one thing...

1246
01:10:22,410 --> 01:10:25,370
...but dancing for others,
that's what counts.

1247
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:36,320
It's showtime.

1248
01:10:49,460 --> 01:10:50,240
That was cool man.

1249
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:51,910
- Take your jackets off.
- Jackets.

1250
01:10:52,570 --> 01:10:53,610
Poddy, take off your jacket.

1251
01:10:56,780 --> 01:10:58,360
Excuse me, what are you doing here?

1252
01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:00,320
- Actually, our friends are inside.
- No, no, please leave.

1253
01:11:00,410 --> 01:11:01,660
They are inside.

1254
01:11:01,860 --> 01:11:02,770
That was cool, man.

1255
01:11:02,850 --> 01:11:04,530
Leave. Out... out.. out...

1256
01:11:04,610 --> 01:11:07,150
- Yeah, Sahej.
- Please, leave. Thank you.

1257
01:11:10,610 --> 01:11:11,820
Let's go.

1258
01:11:20,120 --> 01:11:22,190
Sushi, let's take
a picture for Instagram.

1259
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,150
Come here. Come here, my brother.

1260
01:11:26,450 --> 01:11:27,110
The Royals.

1261
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:29,630
- Royals.
- Royals. Royals!

1262
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:31,740
What?

1263
01:11:31,820 --> 01:11:33,860
- Sushi, your outfit's are amazing.
- Yeah, see...

1264
01:11:33,950 --> 01:11:35,280
Can you get us in too, please?

1265
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:37,660
We just got in.

1266
01:11:37,820 --> 01:11:39,700
But I'll help you guys get in too.

1267
01:11:39,860 --> 01:11:41,780
- Won't go.
- These guys are very good.

1268
01:11:41,940 --> 01:11:44,100
Come on, guys, we're Rule Breakers.

1269
01:11:44,610 --> 01:11:46,220
Our team's much better.

1270
01:11:46,490 --> 01:11:47,200
Hello.

1271
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:50,610
Confidence thrills,
overconfidence kills.

1272
01:11:50,930 --> 01:11:52,660
If you want to win
Ground Zero battle then...

1273
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:54,610
...you'll need top-level dancers.

1274
01:11:54,820 --> 01:11:55,530
Understand.

1275
01:11:55,910 --> 01:11:58,910
Talk about the top level
and the top level's here.

1276
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:01,110
What happened?

1277
01:12:02,490 --> 01:12:04,240
Royals?

1278
01:12:04,610 --> 01:12:05,870
You went and joined them?

1279
01:12:05,950 --> 01:12:07,890
So what?
You want me to join these guys?

1280
01:12:08,270 --> 01:12:09,610
We don't want your support?

1281
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:11,950
You guys don't have
an identity of your own.

1282
01:12:12,030 --> 01:12:13,580
Identity...

1283
01:12:13,660 --> 01:12:15,110
Identity, huh.

1284
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:19,490
Just admit that you're jealous
of seeing us in these outfits?

1285
01:12:19,610 --> 01:12:20,860
Yeah...

1286
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:22,200
And by the way, Anna.

1287
01:12:22,720 --> 01:12:25,410
Rule no.
1 of dancing is, never be no. 2.

1288
01:12:26,420 --> 01:12:29,110
And I know...how to be no. 1.

1289
01:12:29,290 --> 01:12:30,780
- Sahej, watch it.
- Hey...

1290
01:12:30,910 --> 01:12:31,950
- Stay away.
- Come on.

1291
01:12:32,030 --> 01:12:34,990
Anna...why don't you
mind your own business?

1292
01:12:35,610 --> 01:12:36,490
Stop meddling in other's business.

1293
01:12:36,660 --> 01:12:38,530
This is not like
making doughnuts, Anna.

1294
01:12:38,700 --> 01:12:39,860
Do you even know the ABCD of Dance?

1295
01:12:40,110 --> 01:12:41,780
- Guys...
- Ignore them.

1296
01:12:41,860 --> 01:12:42,780
Leave it.

1297
01:12:43,470 --> 01:12:44,660
Anna's grown old.

1298
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:46,680
Chotu, set the table for the Royals.

1299
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:47,860
Guys...let's move out.

1300
01:12:47,950 --> 01:12:50,660
Come on, I am going to treat
you to a royal breakfast today.

1301
01:12:50,740 --> 01:12:51,990
Great.

1302
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:55,410
- What happened to the lights?
- Didn't you pay the bill, Anna?

1303
01:12:55,750 --> 01:12:57,660
"We're the sounds of the streets."

1304
01:13:13,690 --> 01:13:16,610
"I am here tonight..."

1305
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:20,110
"...to steal your heart."

1306
01:13:21,650 --> 01:13:25,530
"If anyone gets in my way..."

1307
01:13:25,610 --> 01:13:28,250
"...I'll make sure he's gone."

1308
01:13:29,590 --> 01:13:31,580
"Face-off..."

1309
01:13:31,660 --> 01:13:36,520
"It's a face-off...sweetheart."

1310
01:13:37,450 --> 01:13:44,580
"It's a face-off...sweetheart."

1311
01:13:56,730 --> 01:13:58,010
"Pull up the base."

1312
01:14:05,100 --> 01:14:06,930
"Pull up the base."

1313
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:09,640
"I am your Romeo..."

1314
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:11,760
"...be my Juliet."

1315
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:15,680
"And together we'll
cast our spell tonight."

1316
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:19,680
"Your words make
my heart skip a beat."

1317
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:23,720
"Tell me what are your intentions?"

1318
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:26,500
"Hold your heart..."

1319
01:14:27,220 --> 01:14:31,030
"...because I am your champion."

1320
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:38,530
"Everything you said and did,
stole my heart."

1321
01:14:39,640 --> 01:14:41,550
"Face-off..."

1322
01:14:41,630 --> 01:14:46,760
"It's a face-off...sweetheart."

1323
01:14:47,630 --> 01:14:54,550
"It's a face-off...sweetheart."

1324
01:14:56,160 --> 01:14:57,840
- "Pull up the base."
- What is this?

1325
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:05,260
You're so good.

1326
01:16:05,340 --> 01:16:07,090
ABCD Of dance, huh?

1327
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:09,950
Now that's what you call dancing.

1328
01:16:10,030 --> 01:16:12,090
My boss...

1329
01:16:15,190 --> 01:16:17,050
Clap for them. What are you doing?

1330
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:21,380
Anna, I am your fan now.

1331
01:16:22,540 --> 01:16:26,630
But you see, Anna, even the
champion uses his trump card...

1332
01:16:27,170 --> 01:16:28,590
...when the other player has a king.

1333
01:16:31,570 --> 01:16:32,880
This will be fun.

1334
01:16:33,150 --> 01:16:35,430
"Urvashi... Urvashi... "

1335
01:16:35,510 --> 01:16:37,340
Get lost...bring it on.

1336
01:16:37,430 --> 01:16:40,050
- Get out! See you! Come on.
- See you never!

1337
01:16:40,130 --> 01:16:44,130
Sir, why didn't you ever
tell us that you dance so well.

1338
01:16:44,910 --> 01:16:46,370
Never needed to.

1339
01:16:46,570 --> 01:16:47,910
But now it is.

1340
01:16:49,990 --> 01:16:51,910
A big smile is very important,
alright.

1341
01:16:52,070 --> 01:16:53,530
Dance makes you happy.

1342
01:16:53,620 --> 01:16:55,200
We'll start with
the choreography, okay.

1343
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:55,780
Remember...

1344
01:16:55,870 --> 01:16:58,370
We'll start with the right leg.
Right together...

1345
01:16:58,450 --> 01:17:00,780
Right and clap.
Left together...

1346
01:17:00,870 --> 01:17:01,820
Left and clap.

1347
01:17:02,070 --> 01:17:03,120
Right together...

1348
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:04,910
Ta-dah!

1349
01:17:06,870 --> 01:17:08,320
What is this?

1350
01:17:08,670 --> 01:17:10,950
Me, Sushi, Poddy, D...

1351
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:12,700
...we are all part of the Royals now.

1352
01:17:14,570 --> 01:17:15,910
Kids, take five.

1353
01:17:16,780 --> 01:17:17,780
Show.

1354
01:17:20,820 --> 01:17:23,120
What is this, brother?
Why can't you ever be happy?

1355
01:17:23,330 --> 01:17:25,030
There's never a full
smile on your face.

1356
01:17:26,870 --> 01:17:29,160
You wanted us to win Ground Zero,
didn't you?

1357
01:17:29,340 --> 01:17:31,950
So this year we're
going to win Ground Zero.

1358
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:41,410
Is your knee okay?

1359
01:17:41,820 --> 01:17:43,120
Yes, it is.

1360
01:17:43,740 --> 01:17:46,320
But Sahej, it just got replaced.

1361
01:17:47,330 --> 01:17:48,530
It's going to hurt a bit.

1362
01:17:49,700 --> 01:17:51,390
But I'll be fine, don't worry.

1363
01:17:53,410 --> 01:17:54,950
You don't look happy, brother.

1364
01:17:56,590 --> 01:17:57,700
Are you happy?

1365
01:17:58,240 --> 01:17:59,200
I am very happy.

1366
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:00,530
Then so am I.

1367
01:18:04,570 --> 01:18:05,870
Well, I'll take the class.

1368
01:18:06,530 --> 01:18:07,820
Kids, come on.

1369
01:18:08,430 --> 01:18:10,120
5... 6... 7... 8...

1370
01:18:43,080 --> 01:18:44,130
Look Sahej.

1371
01:18:45,820 --> 01:18:46,790
Hi!

1372
01:18:52,730 --> 01:18:53,920
He his not looking at us.

1373
01:18:55,260 --> 01:18:56,050
Look at them.

1374
01:18:56,710 --> 01:19:00,970
If he's on our team,
nobody can beat us.

1375
01:19:01,550 --> 01:19:04,260
No, sir. We don't want
such arrogant people.

1376
01:19:04,470 --> 01:19:04,880
Yeah, right.

1377
01:19:04,970 --> 01:19:06,550
I wonder what they
think of themselves.

1378
01:19:06,630 --> 01:19:08,610
- We don't need them, sir.
- Let's go.

1379
01:19:08,690 --> 01:19:11,100
Inayat, we'll need better dancers.

1380
01:19:35,370 --> 01:19:36,830
Just see these hungry faces.

1381
01:19:36,910 --> 01:19:38,580
Are they all immigrants?

1382
01:19:40,580 --> 01:19:41,410
Poor guys.

1383
01:19:41,490 --> 01:19:42,580
It's not done.

1384
01:19:42,910 --> 01:19:43,870
I know it's not.

1385
01:19:43,950 --> 01:19:44,790
Not done.

1386
01:19:44,950 --> 01:19:46,580
That's why we're dancing for them.

1387
01:19:47,370 --> 01:19:48,580
We need your help.

1388
01:19:49,950 --> 01:19:51,330
Poddy, these are your people too.

1389
01:19:51,410 --> 01:19:52,740
It's not about you and me, Alisha.

1390
01:19:52,950 --> 01:19:53,950
It's about them.

1391
01:19:57,200 --> 01:19:58,200
Alright, okay...

1392
01:19:58,580 --> 01:20:00,410
See okay, baby, I'll handle it.

1393
01:20:01,330 --> 01:20:01,830
Right.

1394
01:20:01,990 --> 01:20:03,790
5... 6... 7... 8...

1395
01:20:03,870 --> 01:20:07,240
And 2...3...4... and 5... 6...

1396
01:20:07,540 --> 01:20:08,240
7... 8...

1397
01:20:08,330 --> 01:20:09,540
Wait, wait.

1398
01:20:10,410 --> 01:20:11,830
Are you good?
Are you here?

1399
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:13,040
Are you sure?

1400
01:20:13,620 --> 01:20:14,910
I want you to switch, anyway.

1401
01:20:16,740 --> 01:20:19,240
Wait a second, you switch as well.

1402
01:20:19,370 --> 01:20:19,910
Yeah, right.

1403
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:20,990
Switch

1404
01:20:22,040 --> 01:20:23,950
Come on, let's go.
Come on.

1405
01:20:24,450 --> 01:20:26,160
5... 6... 7... 8...

1406
01:20:26,240 --> 01:20:29,580
And 2...3...4... and 5... 6...

1407
01:20:29,740 --> 01:20:31,580
Na-na-na...
Sorry, sorry...

1408
01:20:31,870 --> 01:20:34,120
What's wrong, man?
How many times do I have to tell you?

1409
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:35,790
Get it right, man, let's go.

1410
01:20:35,950 --> 01:20:38,160
- Mark. Mark. Mark.
- What?

1411
01:20:38,330 --> 01:20:39,580
- Bro, what the hell is he doing?
- Poddy, wait.

1412
01:20:39,700 --> 01:20:42,200
- Mark, I'll talk to him.
- I will punch him.

1413
01:20:42,740 --> 01:20:43,620
- Come outside.
- Go...

1414
01:20:43,740 --> 01:20:45,330
- Yeah.
- Forget it, man.

1415
01:20:46,990 --> 01:20:47,990
Let's go, man.

1416
01:20:48,290 --> 01:20:48,830
Poddy...

1417
01:20:48,910 --> 01:20:49,830
I don't want to dance with him.

1418
01:20:49,910 --> 01:20:51,450
- We're better without him.
- Poddy, listen to me.

1419
01:20:51,580 --> 01:20:52,580
- I don't want to be a Royal.
- Calm down.

1420
01:20:53,490 --> 01:20:54,620
Mark is the leader of the Royals.

1421
01:20:54,870 --> 01:20:55,790
What do you think you're doing?

1422
01:20:57,660 --> 01:20:59,290
Bro, I met Alisha.

1423
01:20:59,580 --> 01:21:00,490
Alisha, who?

1424
01:21:00,620 --> 01:21:02,580
- She's on the Pakistani team.
- Yeah, she is. So?

1425
01:21:02,830 --> 01:21:04,580
We've been dating each other.

1426
01:21:04,830 --> 01:21:05,450
Okay.

1427
01:21:05,740 --> 01:21:08,580
- What?
- So together, we...decided...

1428
01:21:08,870 --> 01:21:09,660
That...

1429
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:10,870
What happened?

1430
01:21:13,910 --> 01:21:14,910
Rascal...

1431
01:21:15,160 --> 01:21:16,290
You're a bloody pervert...

1432
01:21:16,490 --> 01:21:17,910
Can't say about being
the best dancer...

1433
01:21:18,160 --> 01:21:19,870
...but you turned out to be a player.

1434
01:21:20,450 --> 01:21:21,990
Look, man,
she's good for time pass, but dance...

1435
01:21:22,120 --> 01:21:25,490
Bro...I am telling you...
We're in love.

1436
01:21:25,870 --> 01:21:28,540
We...love each other.

1437
01:21:28,910 --> 01:21:30,240
So stay in your limits, Sahej.

1438
01:21:30,330 --> 01:21:31,580
You stay in your limits.

1439
01:21:31,870 --> 01:21:33,580
We're training for
the Ground Zero battle...

1440
01:21:33,870 --> 01:21:35,330
...and what are you doing?

1441
01:21:35,790 --> 01:21:37,490
Dating a member of the rival team.

1442
01:21:37,740 --> 01:21:39,620
It's a trap. They are setting you up.

1443
01:21:39,870 --> 01:21:42,700
- You can't stop drooling when you see...
- Sahej... Sahej...

1444
01:21:42,790 --> 01:21:45,580
Sahej, shut up.
Shut up, man.

1445
01:21:47,700 --> 01:21:50,160
They are not doing this out of greed.

1446
01:21:50,450 --> 01:21:53,410
They want to win the competition
for Indian and Pakistani immigrants.

1447
01:21:53,490 --> 01:21:54,120
Understand.

1448
01:21:54,240 --> 01:21:55,580
Listen, don't give
me these useless talks.

1449
01:21:56,410 --> 01:21:58,620
And you know these immigrants are in this
Condition because of people like you.

1450
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:01,120
Remember now?

1451
01:22:02,450 --> 01:22:03,120
Sahej.

1452
01:22:04,450 --> 01:22:06,160
- But you won't understand.
- Why wouldn't I understand?

1453
01:22:06,330 --> 01:22:07,410
Because you're busy.

1454
01:22:07,490 --> 01:22:08,120
Busy?

1455
01:22:08,200 --> 01:22:09,240
- Yes, you're busy.
- Busy doing what?

1456
01:22:09,330 --> 01:22:10,740
You're busy sucking up to them.

1457
01:22:10,830 --> 01:22:11,870
- Shut up.
- Sahej.

1458
01:22:12,040 --> 01:22:12,870
- Poddy, shut up.
- Sahej.

1459
01:22:12,950 --> 01:22:14,830
Go and lick their boots.

1460
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:16,370
- I said shut up.
- Sahej.

1461
01:22:16,740 --> 01:22:17,290
Sahej.

1462
01:22:17,370 --> 01:22:18,370
I'm telling you just shut up.

1463
01:22:18,580 --> 01:22:20,120
What are you doing?

1464
01:22:20,580 --> 01:22:21,120
Wait, wait, what's happening?

1465
01:22:21,290 --> 01:22:22,870
- Babe?
- What are you doing?

1466
01:22:23,160 --> 01:22:24,870
- What's going on?
- Come on.

1467
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:25,950
- Come on.
- Get out, yeah?

1468
01:22:26,120 --> 01:22:27,580
- Poddy. Poddy. Poddy.
- Let him go.

1469
01:22:27,740 --> 01:22:29,160
- Go, get out.
- You can go.

1470
01:22:29,290 --> 01:22:31,240
Don't come running back to
me when you see their true colours.

1471
01:22:31,330 --> 01:22:31,870
Leave it.

1472
01:22:31,950 --> 01:22:32,790
What's wrong with you?

1473
01:22:32,910 --> 01:22:34,700
I was giving you this
opportunity but ain't worth it.

1474
01:22:35,240 --> 01:22:36,240
What's wrong?

1475
01:22:37,830 --> 01:22:38,700
Sahej.

1476
01:22:41,580 --> 01:22:43,580
- I am ready.
- Let's go, man. Let's go.

1477
01:22:45,410 --> 01:22:46,450
It's not going to be easy.

1478
01:22:46,740 --> 01:22:47,830
Hey, guys.

1479
01:22:52,910 --> 01:22:53,950
When did this happen?

1480
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:08,580
Alright Ladies and Gentlemen,
Boys and girls.

1481
01:23:08,910 --> 01:23:15,620
Welcome to the qualifying round of the
Breezer Vivid presents Ground Zero Battle.

1482
01:23:15,740 --> 01:23:17,290
It's going to be insane.

1483
01:23:17,450 --> 01:23:20,290
Now, remember,
there are no rules, no jury.

1484
01:23:20,540 --> 01:23:21,620
Only fury.

1485
01:23:21,830 --> 01:23:25,240
No matter what happens,
the show must go on.

1486
01:23:25,660 --> 01:23:30,450
Are we ready?

1487
01:23:41,960 --> 01:23:44,610
Oh, man...

1488
01:24:05,540 --> 01:24:08,000
Only the Royals that had to rule.

1489
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:10,120
Just like every year.

1490
01:24:10,290 --> 01:24:13,950
Another cakewalk for the Royals.

1491
01:24:45,940 --> 01:24:47,030
Give it up. Give it up. Give it up.

1492
01:24:47,150 --> 01:24:49,900
Make some noise.

1493
01:25:13,740 --> 01:25:14,740
Oh...

1494
01:25:15,610 --> 01:25:16,400
Ohh...

1495
01:25:16,490 --> 01:25:18,240
that was crazy.

1496
01:25:18,570 --> 01:25:19,990
Now coming up next...

1497
01:26:04,360 --> 01:26:06,820
Yo, here we go, here we go.

1498
01:26:16,310 --> 01:26:18,220
Rule Breakers.

1499
01:26:32,110 --> 01:26:33,740
Rule Breakers!

1500
01:26:33,820 --> 01:26:36,820
Make some noise

1501
01:26:36,900 --> 01:26:39,240
Alright for Rule Breakers...

1502
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:42,820
...let me hear you say yay.

1503
01:26:44,860 --> 01:26:47,240
Yes...

1504
01:26:47,610 --> 01:26:49,240
Let's go...

1505
01:26:49,570 --> 01:26:51,940
You the man, sir. You the man.

1506
01:26:53,190 --> 01:26:55,240
Hey guys, look who's here.

1507
01:26:58,860 --> 01:27:01,610
Hey guys, that was really
nice on stage, you know.

1508
01:27:01,860 --> 01:27:03,780
How did you guys qualify?

1509
01:27:05,190 --> 01:27:06,570
It's all thanks to you, man.

1510
01:27:06,860 --> 01:27:07,900
What do you guys think?

1511
01:27:08,820 --> 01:27:10,570
S** happens, ain't it.

1512
01:27:10,820 --> 01:27:12,610
Look at their faces, though.

1513
01:27:12,780 --> 01:27:14,940
- Mind your language.
- Dancers are just lucky.

1514
01:27:15,110 --> 01:27:16,440
You guys are pathetic, man.

1515
01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:18,400
Get out of my face.

1516
01:27:25,550 --> 01:27:26,740
Sahej...

1517
01:27:28,820 --> 01:27:31,610
Do you know the difference
between your dance and ours?

1518
01:27:33,650 --> 01:27:36,860
You dance for yourself,
and we dance for others.

1519
01:27:45,530 --> 01:27:46,530
Leave it, Anna.

1520
01:27:46,650 --> 01:27:48,150
What's the point talking
to a selfish man like him?

1521
01:27:48,570 --> 01:27:50,610
- Who are you calling selfish?
- Hey...who are you calling selfish.

1522
01:27:50,740 --> 01:27:51,570
I am not saying anything to him.

1523
01:27:51,650 --> 01:27:52,440
Just look at him.

1524
01:27:52,860 --> 01:27:54,360
Don't judge me if you don't know me.

1525
01:27:55,360 --> 01:27:56,610
I dance for my brother.

1526
01:27:57,690 --> 01:27:58,740
Brother?

1527
01:28:01,110 --> 01:28:01,820
Brother?

1528
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:05,440
We dance to express, and you...

1529
01:28:08,150 --> 01:28:09,610
You dance to impress.

1530
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:14,360
Sahej.
Sahej.

1531
01:28:14,440 --> 01:28:15,030
Listen...

1532
01:28:15,190 --> 01:28:16,860
No, guys, they are calling me selfish.

1533
01:28:17,030 --> 01:28:18,110
Poddy is selfish.

1534
01:28:18,360 --> 01:28:20,440
He quit our team and joined them.

1535
01:28:21,190 --> 01:28:22,360
And what did we do?

1536
01:28:24,940 --> 01:28:26,150
We did the exact same thing

1537
01:28:29,360 --> 01:28:30,530
Leave it, let's go.

1538
01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:33,150
Look Sahej, everything else is okay.

1539
01:28:33,490 --> 01:28:34,820
But Mark is also at fault.

1540
01:28:35,030 --> 01:28:37,530
Yeah...but Poddy
should also understand.

1541
01:28:38,030 --> 01:28:39,740
But Sahej, Poddy is our best friend.

1542
01:28:39,990 --> 01:28:40,570
Give me the burger.

1543
01:28:40,940 --> 01:28:42,660
Where are you going? Sit here.

1544
01:28:42,740 --> 01:28:43,610
I want to listen to some music.

1545
01:28:48,650 --> 01:28:50,740
Bro...
Hello, brother.

1546
01:28:51,190 --> 01:28:51,820
Hello.

1547
01:28:52,360 --> 01:28:53,070
Brother.

1548
01:28:53,740 --> 01:28:55,650
It's Amrinder, from Amritsar.

1549
01:28:56,530 --> 01:28:57,570
Remember?

1550
01:28:58,360 --> 01:28:59,320
How are you, brother?

1551
01:28:59,610 --> 01:29:00,940
What have you done to yourself,
Amrinder?

1552
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:05,740
This is because...we've
been running from the Police.

1553
01:29:06,360 --> 01:29:07,860
Thankfully the driver is my friend.

1554
01:29:08,530 --> 01:29:10,070
And lets me sleep here sometimes.

1555
01:29:12,860 --> 01:29:16,610
Why did you lie to us?

1556
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:19,400
What the hell did I lie about?

1557
01:29:19,860 --> 01:29:23,440
At the airport, you were
saying that our futures are bright.

1558
01:29:24,030 --> 01:29:25,360
There are going to
be good times ahead.

1559
01:29:26,190 --> 01:29:27,780
But we went through
the worst of times.

1560
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:30,110
You've no clue what
we've been through.

1561
01:29:30,860 --> 01:29:35,030
We took God's name and arrived
at the address given by Mr. Chawla.

1562
01:29:36,280 --> 01:29:38,570
Clean streets, grand entry...

1563
01:29:39,820 --> 01:29:41,780
We thought everything's
going to be amazing.

1564
01:29:42,030 --> 01:29:43,400
No one can stop us.

1565
01:29:44,070 --> 01:29:47,530
Moreover, we were busy discussing how much
money we're going to send back home.

1566
01:29:48,360 --> 01:29:53,190
But once we entered, we realised that
the situation is completely different.

1567
01:30:00,280 --> 01:30:01,900
Look, we've got more company.

1568
01:30:02,610 --> 01:30:05,650
We were told to burn our passports,
so that no one can deport us.

1569
01:30:06,360 --> 01:30:07,320
So we burnt our passports.

1570
01:30:09,750 --> 01:30:13,080
Everything happened so quickly...

1571
01:30:13,570 --> 01:30:16,250
Whatever remaining pounds we had,
we had to give it to the caretaker.

1572
01:30:16,940 --> 01:30:22,230
The moment we felt that it
can't get more worse... it would.

1573
01:30:22,310 --> 01:30:23,790
Run, Police.

1574
01:30:23,870 --> 01:30:25,470
Take your stuff and run.

1575
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:41,140
"The apple of your eye's...
been shattered to pieces."

1576
01:30:41,640 --> 01:30:48,140
"Please find the heart...
to forgive me, mother."

1577
01:30:48,760 --> 01:30:56,180
"So much happened,
and yet I am alive."

1578
01:30:56,720 --> 01:31:03,590
"I cannot even die willingly."

1579
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:07,720
"I couldn't even keep
the name you gave me."

1580
01:31:08,090 --> 01:31:13,760
"There's nothing else left to lose."

1581
01:31:18,010 --> 01:31:19,430
Brother, only you can help us now.

1582
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:24,930
"I want to go back home."

1583
01:31:25,010 --> 01:31:29,840
- Please send me back.
- Go and tell this to Chawla.

1584
01:31:30,050 --> 01:31:31,090
He sent you guys here.

1585
01:31:31,430 --> 01:31:32,640
Can you lend me some money?

1586
01:31:32,760 --> 01:31:34,590
- I don't have money.
- Then get me a job.

1587
01:31:34,680 --> 01:31:35,010
Stay away.

1588
01:31:35,140 --> 01:31:35,840
I don't have any job for you.

1589
01:31:35,930 --> 01:31:37,590
- I am prepared to do anything.
- Can you dance?

1590
01:31:37,680 --> 01:31:38,550
No.
But I will play the drums for you.

1591
01:31:38,640 --> 01:31:40,260
I don't want your drums.

1592
01:31:40,510 --> 01:31:42,050
I paid you money.

1593
01:31:42,300 --> 01:31:43,300
What money?

1594
01:31:43,930 --> 01:31:45,090
I wasn't responsible for any of you.

1595
01:31:45,220 --> 01:31:46,930
Go and blame that Chawla.

1596
01:31:47,050 --> 01:31:48,390
You weren't like this in Punjab.

1597
01:31:50,260 --> 01:31:51,050
Who is he, Sahej?

1598
01:31:51,260 --> 01:31:52,760
He's emotionally blackmailing me.

1599
01:31:52,970 --> 01:31:54,090
These guys come from India and...

1600
01:31:54,300 --> 01:31:55,050
Please...

1601
01:31:55,510 --> 01:31:56,840
I'll slap you.

1602
01:31:57,840 --> 01:31:59,300
Take me with you, please.
Brother.

1603
01:31:59,930 --> 01:32:00,760
Brother.

1604
01:32:01,720 --> 01:32:02,970
Please, brother.

1605
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:07,890
Sahej, who was he?

1606
01:32:08,640 --> 01:32:11,970
I don't know.
But he's ruined my mood.

1607
01:32:12,760 --> 01:32:14,390
The entire day's wasted.

1608
01:32:15,300 --> 01:32:16,760
See you later.

1609
01:32:18,010 --> 01:32:25,590
"I want to go home."

1610
01:32:25,930 --> 01:32:29,180
"I want to go home."

1611
01:32:29,640 --> 01:32:33,510
"Mom is waiting for me..."

1612
01:32:33,720 --> 01:32:37,470
"I want to go home."

1613
01:32:37,720 --> 01:32:44,720
"I want to go home."

1614
01:32:44,890 --> 01:32:46,590
Sahej...

1615
01:32:54,550 --> 01:33:01,760
Welcome to the quarterfinal round of the
Breezer Vivid presents Ground Zero Battle.

1616
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:40,630
So let's make some noise
for the Royals.

1617
01:34:39,490 --> 01:34:41,360
Say what...

1618
01:34:42,900 --> 01:34:47,570
Alright, coming up next...the
Rule Breakers. vs the Bird Gang.

1619
01:34:47,700 --> 01:34:50,360
DJ, hit that beat.

1620
01:35:20,920 --> 01:35:22,260
Oh my, God.

1621
01:35:22,420 --> 01:35:26,420
Make some noise for the Rule Breakers.

1622
01:35:27,590 --> 01:35:29,210
Look at that. Look at that.

1623
01:35:29,300 --> 01:35:31,880
The anger, the love,
the thrust, the challenge.

1624
01:35:32,050 --> 01:35:34,710
These dancers just
showing the pure emotion...

1625
01:35:34,920 --> 01:35:36,840
...that they are opponents,
not enemies.

1626
01:35:42,190 --> 01:35:43,520
- Mark. Mark. Mark.
- Mark, come on.

1627
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:44,100
See...

1628
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:45,850
Come on, come on, Mark.
Indian drums.

1629
01:35:47,850 --> 01:35:49,020
- Come, come, come.
- I want to see this.

1630
01:35:49,100 --> 01:35:51,520
I want to see this, bro.
I love Indian drums.

1631
01:35:53,730 --> 01:35:54,940
Hip-hip-hurray...

1632
01:35:56,980 --> 01:35:57,770
I am not in the mood.

1633
01:35:57,850 --> 01:35:59,560
Come on, it'll be fun.

1634
01:36:00,440 --> 01:36:02,980
- Come on, come on.
- Listen, listen, I don't want to.

1635
01:36:03,310 --> 01:36:06,100
- Come on, guys, I don't want to.
- Come on Sahej, move it! Dance!

1636
01:36:06,850 --> 01:36:07,900
Come on, man.

1637
01:36:07,980 --> 01:36:09,100
Come on, baby.

1638
01:36:32,020 --> 01:36:34,440
- 'I am your brother.'
- 'Okay, brother.'

1639
01:36:34,650 --> 01:36:38,150
'And don't forget me
after you all become famous.'

1640
01:36:48,730 --> 01:36:52,020
Yo man, why did you stop?
Play the drums, man.

1641
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:53,850
Play some music, bro.

1642
01:36:54,100 --> 01:36:55,600
Play some music.

1643
01:36:56,190 --> 01:36:58,940
- Yeah.
- Come on. Come on.

1644
01:36:59,310 --> 01:37:01,270
Oh shit.

1645
01:37:01,690 --> 01:37:03,190
- Sorry.
- Mark, guys chill.

1646
01:37:03,770 --> 01:37:06,810
Guys, guys, stop, stop.
Relax. Calm down.

1647
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:09,440
What are you doing? Mark?

1648
01:37:09,520 --> 01:37:10,600
Guys, guys.

1649
01:37:10,690 --> 01:37:12,600
Calm down.
What are you doing? Mark?

1650
01:37:13,850 --> 01:37:14,770
Who you talking to?
- Alright.

1651
01:37:14,850 --> 01:37:15,900
Do you know who you're talking to?

1652
01:37:15,980 --> 01:37:17,730
Enough, let's go.

1653
01:37:18,150 --> 01:37:19,060
Let's go, come on.

1654
01:37:19,150 --> 01:37:19,900
Let's go.

1655
01:37:19,980 --> 01:37:21,770
Let's go, baby.

1656
01:37:47,650 --> 01:37:49,190
Yo, you coming or not?

1657
01:37:51,810 --> 01:37:52,850
No, thank you.

1658
01:37:53,270 --> 01:37:54,730
Let's go. Come on.

1659
01:37:55,020 --> 01:37:56,020
Let's go.

1660
01:38:05,730 --> 01:38:06,850
What's going on?

1661
01:38:07,310 --> 01:38:08,100
Nothing.

1662
01:38:10,060 --> 01:38:11,480
Are you hiding something from us?

1663
01:38:11,850 --> 01:38:12,440
No.

1664
01:38:13,230 --> 01:38:16,650
Listen...at least don't
lie to your friends.

1665
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:18,850
I've known you since we were kids.

1666
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:20,850
Do you know what your problem is?

1667
01:38:21,310 --> 01:38:23,560
You never realise your mistake.

1668
01:38:26,060 --> 01:38:28,270
Sahej, we're your friends...

1669
01:38:28,490 --> 01:38:29,850
...so here's a piece of advice.

1670
01:38:30,190 --> 01:38:31,850
Do what you want in life,

1671
01:38:32,190 --> 01:38:33,900
...but never break anyone's heart.

1672
01:38:35,060 --> 01:38:37,690
Because you may
or may not get blessings.

1673
01:38:38,060 --> 01:38:42,270
But you can never outrun a curse.

1674
01:38:47,940 --> 01:38:50,730
"I've been all over the world..."

1675
01:38:50,810 --> 01:38:53,440
"...been every nook and corner."

1676
01:38:53,520 --> 01:38:56,270
"But wonder why I forgot..."

1677
01:38:56,350 --> 01:38:58,940
"...my way back home?"

1678
01:38:59,400 --> 01:39:04,820
"Where did I go wrong?"
"Why did I stray?"

1679
01:39:04,900 --> 01:39:10,850
"I wonder why I hurt
ones close to me?"

1680
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:16,850
"I hope I am forgiven."
"And my tears stop trickling."

1681
01:39:17,190 --> 01:39:20,900
"I hope God hears my plea."

1682
01:39:24,150 --> 01:39:29,560
"Someone pray for me."
"Someone pray for me."

1683
01:39:29,730 --> 01:39:35,440
"Someone pray for me."

1684
01:39:35,650 --> 01:39:40,900
"Someone pray for me."

1685
01:39:41,020 --> 01:39:48,850
"Someone bring the dawn for me."

1686
01:39:58,520 --> 01:40:00,480
"Let me cry...all night."

1687
01:40:00,560 --> 01:40:02,520
"Let me be in pain..."

1688
01:40:02,770 --> 01:40:05,520
"Let my peace and serenity disappear."

1689
01:40:05,730 --> 01:40:09,600
"Let me be restless...
while the world sleeps."

1690
01:40:09,810 --> 01:40:11,100
"My life..."

1691
01:40:11,190 --> 01:40:13,820
"...the things I did with my kin."

1692
01:40:13,900 --> 01:40:16,690
"I've broken their trust."

1693
01:40:16,850 --> 01:40:19,600
"I let others lose so I can win."

1694
01:40:19,690 --> 01:40:20,980
"That's my life..."

1695
01:40:21,060 --> 01:40:23,650
"What's the point of this victory?"

1696
01:40:23,980 --> 01:40:26,690
"It's just a pointless victory."

1697
01:40:26,770 --> 01:40:29,440
"It's just a passing victory."

1698
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:32,400
"This victory has came
from malice and cheat."

1699
01:41:41,060 --> 01:41:46,690
"Someone pray for me."
"Someone pray for me."

1700
01:41:46,770 --> 01:41:52,060
"Someone pray for me."
"Someone pray for me."

1701
01:41:52,270 --> 01:41:54,850
"Someone pray for me."

1702
01:41:55,020 --> 01:41:57,770
"Someone pray for me."

1703
01:41:57,850 --> 01:42:04,650
"Someone bring the dawn for me."

1704
01:42:14,980 --> 01:42:16,310
I had no choice, brother.

1705
01:42:17,810 --> 01:42:19,520
I wasn't a dancer like you.

1706
01:42:20,850 --> 01:42:23,190
Nor did I have your
confidence in my group.

1707
01:42:24,730 --> 01:42:27,100
So I took off the
Street Dancer jacket.

1708
01:42:29,480 --> 01:42:30,900
I was selfish.

1709
01:42:33,560 --> 01:42:34,480
Sorry.

1710
01:42:36,020 --> 01:42:37,100
You know what Sahej...

1711
01:42:39,730 --> 01:42:42,850
....our heart doesn't
rationalize like our mind.

1712
01:42:43,190 --> 01:42:46,900
But when it does, it's always right.

1713
01:42:51,440 --> 01:42:52,770
Time to give your heart a chance,
my brother.

1714
01:42:54,100 --> 01:42:56,440
Just listen to it.

1715
01:42:59,850 --> 01:43:02,520
We have won the first two
rounds of the Ground Zero Battle.

1716
01:43:02,600 --> 01:43:05,020
Only the Semi-Finals
and Finals left to go.

1717
01:43:06,020 --> 01:43:08,850
And we'll succeed only
when you all will pray for us.

1718
01:43:09,480 --> 01:43:11,850
Our prayers will always be with you.

1719
01:43:12,940 --> 01:43:14,650
Support you, don't worry.

1720
01:43:14,850 --> 01:43:16,770
You're doing so much for us.

1721
01:43:17,190 --> 01:43:18,850
Can we come and see you dance?

1722
01:43:19,100 --> 01:43:21,020
And anyway, we don't have any jobs.

1723
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:22,690
So, we'll come there
and cheer for you.

1724
01:43:23,270 --> 01:43:23,810
Huh?

1725
01:43:24,270 --> 01:43:25,100
Can we?

1726
01:43:25,270 --> 01:43:25,850
Yes.

1727
01:43:25,940 --> 01:43:29,730
So be the God's purity,
so be the God's victory.

1728
01:44:10,940 --> 01:44:14,770
Welcome back to Breezer
Vivid Presents Ground Zero Battle.

1729
01:44:14,850 --> 01:44:17,100
We're at the semi-finals, guys.

1730
01:44:17,190 --> 01:44:19,560
We've had the best
team from around the world.

1731
01:44:19,650 --> 01:44:22,350
And now it's come
down to the final four.

1732
01:44:22,440 --> 01:44:23,310
Literally.

1733
01:44:23,480 --> 01:44:25,230
With our first semi-finals...

1734
01:44:25,310 --> 01:44:33,480
...we have The Royals Vs.
Team Recycle.

1735
01:44:33,810 --> 01:44:36,440
Hey DJ, drop the beat.

1736
01:44:36,520 --> 01:44:37,850
Let's go.

1737
01:44:38,100 --> 01:44:39,850
Level up. Level up.

1738
01:45:19,230 --> 01:45:22,190
Now, let's see what The Royal's got.

1739
01:45:22,270 --> 01:45:22,980
Let's go.

1740
01:45:56,350 --> 01:45:57,980
I think we have a winner.

1741
01:45:58,270 --> 01:46:00,100
I think we have our first finalist.

1742
01:46:00,400 --> 01:46:01,850
We have our first finalist.

1743
01:46:01,940 --> 01:46:03,900
Going to...the Finals.

1744
01:46:04,100 --> 01:46:04,980
It's...

1745
01:46:07,850 --> 01:46:09,100
The Royals.

1746
01:46:11,730 --> 01:46:13,690
So we have our first finalist.

1747
01:46:13,980 --> 01:46:14,980
Right now.

1748
01:46:15,400 --> 01:46:18,730
Going into our second
and final semi-final.

1749
01:46:18,940 --> 01:46:19,820
Who is it?

1750
01:46:19,900 --> 01:46:23,850
We have the Wild Ripperz

1751
01:46:26,230 --> 01:46:29,100
VS Rule Breakerz.

1752
01:46:29,190 --> 01:46:30,690
Remember, there are no rules.

1753
01:46:30,770 --> 01:46:33,600
So no matter what happens,
the show must go on.

1754
01:47:23,100 --> 01:47:24,310
Look at their faces.

1755
01:47:48,850 --> 01:47:49,980
Get it.

1756
01:47:53,730 --> 01:47:54,850
Let's go.

1757
01:48:40,770 --> 01:48:41,770
What are you guys doing?

1758
01:48:42,150 --> 01:48:43,060
- What is he doing?
Come on, D.

1759
01:48:44,100 --> 01:48:45,520
What are you guys doing?

1760
01:48:56,150 --> 01:48:58,100
Just go get Mark.
Just go get him.

1761
01:49:16,440 --> 01:49:18,400
He's turning against us.

1762
01:49:32,650 --> 01:49:33,770
Mark, look.

1763
01:49:34,650 --> 01:49:35,270
Look at them.

1764
01:49:45,940 --> 01:49:47,650
"Don't take me..."
"Don't take me..."

1765
01:49:47,850 --> 01:49:50,690
"Don't take me lightly."

1766
01:49:53,690 --> 01:49:55,560
"Be careful..."
"Be careful..."

1767
01:49:55,650 --> 01:49:57,900
"Be careful when you're around."

1768
01:50:01,400 --> 01:50:02,980
"Don't take me..."
"Don't take me..."

1769
01:50:03,060 --> 01:50:04,850
"Don't take me lightly."

1770
01:50:04,940 --> 01:50:06,820
"Be careful..."
"Be careful..."

1771
01:50:06,900 --> 01:50:08,900
"Be careful when you're around."

1772
01:50:08,980 --> 01:50:12,600
"There's a storm raging in my heart."
"I've no other way."

1773
01:50:12,690 --> 01:50:15,520
"I am gonna say what I never did..."

1774
01:50:15,600 --> 01:50:17,400
"I've been..."

1775
01:50:17,480 --> 01:50:19,190
"I've been..."

1776
01:50:19,270 --> 01:50:23,310
"I've been silent for too long."

1777
01:50:23,400 --> 01:50:26,810
"Said nothing though I was wronged."

1778
01:50:27,060 --> 01:50:30,850
"I've been silent for too long."

1779
01:50:30,940 --> 01:50:34,190
"Said nothing though I was wronged."

1780
01:50:34,270 --> 01:50:36,770
"Watch out we're back again. Go..."

1781
01:50:51,440 --> 01:50:53,690
"Watch out we're back again. Go..."

1782
01:50:55,020 --> 01:51:01,560
"My passion..."

1783
01:51:10,690 --> 01:51:14,520
"Don't let anyone stop you."

1784
01:51:14,600 --> 01:51:17,940
"Never bow."

1785
01:51:18,020 --> 01:51:24,350
"You will emerge out of the storm."

1786
01:51:31,520 --> 01:51:33,020
"Dancing is my way to express."

1787
01:51:33,100 --> 01:51:35,020
"Dancing is my bread and water."

1788
01:51:35,100 --> 01:51:36,940
"I am calm but my dancing is a storm."

1789
01:51:37,020 --> 01:51:38,850
"I am the king and
my dance is my queen."

1790
01:51:38,940 --> 01:51:40,690
"Dancing is my faith
and self-respect."

1791
01:51:40,770 --> 01:51:42,690
"Dancing is like an
arrow shot from the bow."

1792
01:51:42,770 --> 01:51:44,520
"Dancing is my religion."

1793
01:51:44,600 --> 01:51:46,900
"Dancing is my only God."

1794
01:51:47,600 --> 01:51:49,440
"Dancing is my only God."

1795
01:52:01,060 --> 01:52:02,650
"I've been silent..."

1796
01:52:04,350 --> 01:52:06,100
"Watch out we're back again. Go..."

1797
01:52:06,190 --> 01:52:09,730
"You can restrain
us...or suppress us."

1798
01:52:09,980 --> 01:52:13,560
"We'll die but will never give up."

1799
01:52:13,650 --> 01:52:17,100
"We were always one,
and always be one."

1800
01:52:17,730 --> 01:52:21,190
"You cannot separate us now."

1801
01:52:21,270 --> 01:52:23,020
"There's a storm raging in my heart."

1802
01:52:23,100 --> 01:52:24,940
"I've no other way."

1803
01:52:25,020 --> 01:52:27,900
"I am gonna say what I never did..."

1804
01:52:27,980 --> 01:52:30,520
"I've been silent for too long."

1805
01:52:30,600 --> 01:52:35,190
"Said nothing though I was wronged."

1806
01:52:35,690 --> 01:52:39,440
"I've been silent for too long."

1807
01:52:39,520 --> 01:52:42,810
"Said nothing though I was wronged."

1808
01:53:05,560 --> 01:53:09,190
"Don't let anyone stop you."

1809
01:53:09,270 --> 01:53:12,690
"Never bow."

1810
01:53:12,770 --> 01:53:18,150
"You will emerge out of the storm."

1811
01:53:26,480 --> 01:53:27,560
Come on.

1812
01:53:30,440 --> 01:53:31,850
- Come on, Poddy.
- Killed it. Killed it.

1813
01:53:32,690 --> 01:53:33,020
Thanks.

1814
01:53:33,100 --> 01:53:33,850
Yo what...

1815
01:53:34,020 --> 01:53:35,230
Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey.

1816
01:53:35,310 --> 01:53:36,520
- Mark.
- Poddy. Poddy.

1817
01:53:36,850 --> 01:53:37,480
Wait.

1818
01:53:37,690 --> 01:53:38,770
Get off me, man.

1819
01:53:38,850 --> 01:53:39,850
Don't touch my friend.

1820
01:53:42,650 --> 01:53:43,730
The last time you did this,

1821
01:53:43,980 --> 01:53:46,150
I behaved like an ass***
and lost my friends.

1822
01:53:47,810 --> 01:53:49,100
But this time I want to thank you.

1823
01:53:52,190 --> 01:53:53,650
Because my friends are back.

1824
01:54:05,690 --> 01:54:06,850
Look at their faces.

1825
01:54:10,850 --> 01:54:12,020
See you in the finals, man.

1826
01:54:12,100 --> 01:54:13,060
Get lost. Get out.

1827
01:54:13,150 --> 01:54:13,980
See you in the finals.

1828
01:54:14,060 --> 01:54:16,020
- Bye-bye.
- Come on, let's go.

1829
01:54:16,270 --> 01:54:17,730
See you in the finals.

1830
01:54:19,850 --> 01:54:21,100
Nora, come on.

1831
01:54:21,190 --> 01:54:22,810
Mark, come on.
Nora, let's go.

1832
01:54:26,400 --> 01:54:26,900
Let her go, bro.

1833
01:54:29,890 --> 01:54:31,140
Brother, Sahej's here.

1834
01:54:34,140 --> 01:54:35,890
- Thank you, brother.
- Thank you, brother.

1835
01:54:35,970 --> 01:54:36,720
Thank you, brother.

1836
01:54:36,800 --> 01:54:37,850
Thank you, brother.

1837
01:54:44,800 --> 01:54:46,100
Call your mom.

1838
01:54:47,160 --> 01:54:48,740
Tell her you're coming home.

1839
01:55:01,440 --> 01:55:02,430
Hello.

1840
01:55:05,590 --> 01:55:06,600
Mom.

1841
01:55:27,220 --> 01:55:28,970
Hey... man...

1842
01:55:29,150 --> 01:55:31,310
You got it boy...
Steal the night...

1843
01:55:33,020 --> 01:55:35,550
I told you if we team-up...

1844
01:55:35,920 --> 01:55:37,390
...we'll definitely win.

1845
01:55:37,470 --> 01:55:38,640
- Yeah...
- Yes, sir.

1846
01:55:38,720 --> 01:55:39,800
Definite chances.

1847
01:55:39,880 --> 01:55:40,810
Wait a minute.

1848
01:55:40,890 --> 01:55:41,640
What?

1849
01:55:42,760 --> 01:55:44,430
What are we going to call our team?

1850
01:55:45,660 --> 01:55:46,760
Rule Breakers is better.

1851
01:55:46,890 --> 01:55:48,380
- Rule Breakers.
- Yeah...

1852
01:55:48,460 --> 01:55:49,830
- Yes.
- Yea.

1853
01:55:50,550 --> 01:55:51,890
Rules Breakers is...

1854
01:55:51,970 --> 01:55:52,660
No...

1855
01:55:52,740 --> 01:55:54,680
- It's good, sir.
- No.

1856
01:55:56,320 --> 01:55:57,470
Street Dancers.

1857
01:55:57,600 --> 01:55:58,400
Street Dancers.

1858
01:55:58,480 --> 01:55:59,580
Wow...

1859
01:55:59,660 --> 01:56:01,150
Street Dancers.

1860
01:56:01,590 --> 01:56:03,550
- Even better.
- Wow...

1861
01:56:03,780 --> 01:56:05,050
Yea.

1862
01:56:06,260 --> 01:56:07,820
The real Street Dancer is here.

1863
01:56:07,900 --> 01:56:08,890
Come on.

1864
01:56:09,160 --> 01:56:09,850
Oh...

1865
01:56:09,930 --> 01:56:10,910
Come on.

1866
01:56:11,230 --> 01:56:14,010
Let's call it Street Dancer.
We're generous people.

1867
01:56:16,680 --> 01:56:20,010
6... 7... 8... 9...

1868
01:56:21,100 --> 01:56:22,090
Excuse me.

1869
01:56:22,570 --> 01:56:23,680
Can I come in?

1870
01:56:26,010 --> 01:56:27,910
Madam, are you guys done?

1871
01:56:29,110 --> 01:56:29,890
Yeah.

1872
01:56:30,030 --> 01:56:31,470
Come on.

1873
01:56:31,550 --> 01:56:32,140
Sorry...

1874
01:56:32,220 --> 01:56:33,350
- Control. Control.
- Come here bro.

1875
01:56:33,430 --> 01:56:33,890
Sir.

1876
01:56:34,480 --> 01:56:35,560
Street Dancer it is...

1877
01:56:35,640 --> 01:56:36,970
Come here.

1878
01:56:37,890 --> 01:56:38,970
- My bag.
- What happened?

1879
01:56:39,260 --> 01:56:40,800
- Where's my bag?
- Did you get stuck?

1880
01:56:45,640 --> 01:56:48,390
All hail...Lord Ganesha!

1881
01:56:58,050 --> 01:57:02,680
"Lord Ganesha..."

1882
01:57:02,890 --> 01:57:07,300
"Lord Ganesha..."

1883
01:57:07,760 --> 01:57:12,100
"Lord Ganesha..."

1884
01:57:12,550 --> 01:57:17,010
"Lord Ganesha..."

1885
01:57:17,390 --> 01:57:19,850
"Lord Ganesha..."

1886
01:57:19,930 --> 01:57:22,050
"Let my voice echo
and the beat resonate."

1887
01:57:22,140 --> 01:57:26,140
"Lord Ganesha..."

1888
01:57:26,930 --> 01:57:29,560
"Lord Ganesha..."

1889
01:57:29,640 --> 01:57:31,810
"I surrender myself
to you when I dance..."

1890
01:57:31,890 --> 01:57:35,890
"Lord Ganesha..."

1891
01:57:36,600 --> 01:57:41,720
"Everything I do is for you...
and only for you..."

1892
01:57:41,800 --> 01:57:43,970
"Lord Ganesha..."

1893
01:57:44,050 --> 01:57:46,100
"I surrender myself
to you when I dance..."

1894
01:57:46,180 --> 01:57:48,890
"Lord Ganesha..."

1895
01:57:50,800 --> 01:57:55,920
"I've won the world
since I surrendered to you."

1896
01:57:56,180 --> 01:58:00,140
"Your devotee's never lost to anyone."

1897
01:58:00,600 --> 01:58:05,000
"I've won the world
since I surrendered to you."

1898
01:58:05,740 --> 01:58:10,100
"Your devotee's never lost to anyone."

1899
01:58:10,180 --> 01:58:12,350
"I am always high on your devotion..."

1900
01:58:12,430 --> 01:58:14,970
"...I am a boat."

1901
01:58:15,310 --> 01:58:17,810
"I won't fear the storm,
or go astray..."

1902
01:58:17,890 --> 01:58:19,550
"...if you're my protector."

1903
01:58:19,640 --> 01:58:23,600
"Lord Ganesha..."

1904
01:58:48,970 --> 01:58:51,220
The world's best dance group.

1905
01:58:51,300 --> 01:58:52,470
- What do we do?
- Win!

1906
01:58:52,550 --> 01:58:53,970
- What do we do?
- Win!

1907
01:59:18,530 --> 01:59:19,800
What are you doing?

1908
01:59:20,680 --> 01:59:21,890
Give me that.

1909
01:59:22,280 --> 01:59:24,550
Mom please.

1910
01:59:24,800 --> 01:59:28,970
1... 2...
3... 4... 5... 6... 7... 8...

1911
01:59:29,260 --> 01:59:30,470
Why are you late, bro?

1912
01:59:30,550 --> 01:59:32,510
- There's something missing, bro.
- I've seen it.

1913
01:59:32,600 --> 01:59:33,640
Why are you late?

1914
01:59:34,050 --> 01:59:35,550
- Where is Inayat?
- You guys watch anything.

1915
01:59:35,720 --> 01:59:36,850
Do like this.

1916
01:59:36,930 --> 01:59:38,260
Now she won't come, Sahej.

1917
01:59:40,720 --> 01:59:41,800
What do you mean?

1918
01:59:42,800 --> 01:59:44,850
Our conservative families
don't approve of dancing.

1919
01:59:45,720 --> 01:59:47,510
They didn't know that we dance.

1920
01:59:48,300 --> 01:59:49,470
Now they know.

1921
01:59:56,050 --> 01:59:57,600
Can you take me to her home?

1922
01:59:58,560 --> 02:00:00,800
Making these videos,
putting it on the internet...

1923
02:00:00,880 --> 02:00:02,760
Putting it on display
isn't right, brother.

1924
02:00:02,890 --> 02:00:04,810
In fact, you should get her married...

1925
02:00:04,890 --> 02:00:06,760
...she should quit
dancing and settle down.

1926
02:00:06,890 --> 02:00:08,970
Dancing on the streets,
making these videos...

1927
02:00:09,220 --> 02:00:10,600
Father...
Zain.

1928
02:00:10,680 --> 02:00:11,350
Greetings.

1929
02:00:12,760 --> 02:00:13,470
Junaid.

1930
02:00:14,550 --> 02:00:15,720
He is...

1931
02:00:19,220 --> 02:00:19,930
Greetings.

1932
02:00:20,770 --> 02:00:21,720
I am Sahej.

1933
02:00:21,930 --> 02:00:24,510
- Inayat and I...
- I know about you.

1934
02:00:25,140 --> 02:00:26,930
I think its best you leave.

1935
02:00:28,930 --> 02:00:30,060
Uncle, I have a request...

1936
02:00:30,140 --> 02:00:31,100
Why are you taking his side?

1937
02:00:31,260 --> 02:00:32,430
- Get out.
- Sir, take it easy.

1938
02:00:32,510 --> 02:00:33,800
- Out of my house, now.
- Sir, take it easy.

1939
02:00:33,890 --> 02:00:35,430
- Shahnawaz.
- Sir, take it easy.

1940
02:00:36,250 --> 02:00:37,000
Please.

1941
02:00:38,500 --> 02:00:42,580
I just came to say
that you guys are right.

1942
02:00:44,200 --> 02:00:45,000
Sahej, please...

1943
02:00:45,080 --> 02:00:47,120
Because a girl from such
a respected and classy family...

1944
02:00:47,330 --> 02:00:51,200
...dresses in short clothes and gets
into a dirty profession like dancing...

1945
02:00:51,660 --> 02:00:53,200
...it would make anyone's blood boil.

1946
02:00:53,700 --> 02:00:55,040
So you guys are absolutely right.

1947
02:00:56,000 --> 02:01:00,200
Doesn't matter that Dance is an art,
and passion for Inayat.

1948
02:01:00,360 --> 02:01:01,410
Frankly, it's her life.

1949
02:01:02,450 --> 02:01:03,790
So you guys are absolutely right.

1950
02:01:04,300 --> 02:01:08,120
And also doesn't matter that
dance isn't some skin show for her.

1951
02:01:08,640 --> 02:01:11,050
In fact, it's a display
of her talent and skills.

1952
02:01:12,390 --> 02:01:13,800
So you guys are absolutely right.

1953
02:01:14,850 --> 02:01:18,310
And this definitely doesn't matter
that she wants to win the tournament...

1954
02:01:18,690 --> 02:01:21,560
...and send those illegal
immigrants back home.

1955
02:01:21,910 --> 02:01:25,100
Something that you
have never thought of.

1956
02:01:25,800 --> 02:01:27,180
She wants to save lives.

1957
02:01:27,490 --> 02:01:28,470
But does that matter?

1958
02:01:30,240 --> 02:01:31,180
It doesn't matter.

1959
02:01:32,220 --> 02:01:33,850
But one thing matters, sir.

1960
02:01:35,060 --> 02:01:35,850
My grandma.

1961
02:01:37,020 --> 02:01:38,560
As my grandma always says...

1962
02:01:39,520 --> 02:01:42,140
Whether you chant
the name of God or not...

1963
02:01:43,190 --> 02:01:47,270
...but the moment when you help
someone else is nothing short of devotion.

1964
02:01:48,390 --> 02:01:50,100
And your daughter
wants to do just that.

1965
02:01:51,150 --> 02:01:53,720
So she is right and you're all wrong.

1966
02:01:55,280 --> 02:01:56,170
You're wrong.

1967
02:01:58,580 --> 02:01:59,680
Say something, Inayat.

1968
02:02:00,710 --> 02:02:02,100
You must speak up today.

1969
02:02:03,390 --> 02:02:06,770
You're such a bully outside.
Tell your father.

1970
02:02:11,680 --> 02:02:12,600
Father...

1971
02:02:15,970 --> 02:02:17,560
Father, remember you told me once ...

1972
02:02:18,430 --> 02:02:21,180
...that Allah needs to like
just one expression in a human being.

1973
02:02:21,820 --> 02:02:25,680
And if Allah likes it, then his world
and Paradise shall both be redeemed.

1974
02:02:27,760 --> 02:02:30,680
If not in me,
at least have faith in my upbringing.

1975
02:02:31,930 --> 02:02:34,850
I've never done or will do
anything to humiliate you.

1976
02:02:35,700 --> 02:02:37,300
This is wrong, brother.

1977
02:02:50,310 --> 02:02:51,230
When are the finals?

1978
02:02:53,630 --> 02:02:58,230
"If I ever stagger..."

1979
02:02:58,310 --> 02:03:02,940
"...don't let me fall."

1980
02:03:03,190 --> 02:03:05,530
"If you dwell in my heart..."

1981
02:03:05,610 --> 02:03:07,960
"...then I'll win it all."

1982
02:03:08,040 --> 02:03:12,500
"No matter who I face."

1983
02:03:12,680 --> 02:03:15,380
"Lord Ganesha..."

1984
02:03:15,460 --> 02:03:17,450
"Let my voice echo
and the beat resonate."

1985
02:03:17,530 --> 02:03:20,630
"Lord Ganesha..."

1986
02:03:21,840 --> 02:03:24,910
"Lord Ganesha..."
Sahej.

1987
02:03:24,990 --> 02:03:27,010
"I surrender myself
to you when I dance..."

1988
02:03:27,090 --> 02:03:29,850
"Lord Ganesha..."

1989
02:03:33,230 --> 02:03:39,650
Guys, welcome to the finale of the
Ground Zero Battle. It's the finals.

1990
02:03:40,540 --> 02:03:42,190
Give it up guys.

1991
02:03:42,270 --> 02:03:49,520
We've had the best crews from around the
world competing to get to this spot today.

1992
02:03:49,600 --> 02:03:53,890
We have the Royals vs. Street Dancers.

1993
02:03:55,220 --> 02:03:56,890
Smash it, boys.

1994
02:03:57,550 --> 02:03:58,380
Watch out.

1995
02:03:59,590 --> 02:04:00,670
Watch out.

1996
02:06:25,800 --> 02:06:29,390
Give it up.
Give it up. Give it up for the Royals.

1997
02:06:30,220 --> 02:06:32,810
- Let's go, man. Let's go.
- - Royals!

1998
02:06:32,890 --> 02:06:35,130
- Royals!
- Royals!

1999
02:06:35,210 --> 02:06:36,340
Woah! Let's go guys.

2000
02:06:36,420 --> 02:06:40,300
Royals! Royals!

2001
02:07:33,060 --> 02:07:37,990
Woah! Woah! Woah! Woah!

2002
02:07:40,520 --> 02:07:42,520
Tashan. Music.

2003
02:07:42,600 --> 02:07:43,700
They will restart it, won't they?

2004
02:07:43,870 --> 02:07:44,930
We'll do it again.

2005
02:07:45,010 --> 02:07:47,120
No Music.

2006
02:07:47,200 --> 02:07:48,520
Something's definitely wrong.

2007
02:07:51,390 --> 02:07:53,140
- Where's the music?
- Just play the track again.

2008
02:07:53,220 --> 02:07:53,720
We'll do it again.

2009
02:07:53,800 --> 02:07:57,260
There is no music guys, it
looks like the Royals are the winners.

2010
02:07:57,350 --> 02:07:58,680
- Just play the track again.
- What?

2011
02:07:58,760 --> 02:07:59,960
No, that's not happening.

2012
02:08:00,040 --> 02:08:01,850
There is no music,
there is no performance.

2013
02:08:01,930 --> 02:08:02,840
That means you cannot win.

2014
02:08:02,920 --> 02:08:05,650
That's not fair. You can't do that.
You can't disqualify us.

2015
02:08:05,970 --> 02:08:07,370
It's my house, my rules.

2016
02:08:07,450 --> 02:08:09,180
- There's no rule.
- We'll do it again.

2017
02:08:09,350 --> 02:08:10,140
Come on.

2018
02:08:10,220 --> 02:08:11,260
Come on, guys.

2019
02:08:11,340 --> 02:08:13,020
What's up, my man. Alright.

2020
02:08:13,100 --> 02:08:14,490
- Come on...
- Sir you can't do this.

2021
02:08:14,880 --> 02:08:16,260
You can't do that.

2022
02:08:16,700 --> 02:08:20,720
Royals. Royals. Royals. Royals.

2023
02:08:20,800 --> 02:08:23,850
Royals. Royals. Royals. Royals.

2024
02:08:23,930 --> 02:08:26,520
Royals. Royals. Royals. Royals.

2025
02:08:26,600 --> 02:08:26,970
What?

2026
02:08:27,050 --> 02:08:28,320
How are you guys be okay with it?

2027
02:08:28,400 --> 02:08:31,750
Royals. Royals. Royals. Royals.

2028
02:08:31,830 --> 02:08:36,840
Royals. Royals. Royals. Royals.

2029
02:08:45,130 --> 02:08:46,940
I can play the drums.

2030
02:08:47,020 --> 02:08:48,390
I don't want your drums.

2031
02:08:52,220 --> 02:08:54,180
They play and I dance.

2032
02:08:54,760 --> 02:08:59,720
"Sometimes in life you
feel it's impossible to make it."

2033
02:09:02,550 --> 02:09:04,550
- "My friend is bound to win because...'
- Music.

2034
02:09:04,640 --> 02:09:06,970
"...he never gives up."

2035
02:09:07,510 --> 02:09:09,680
Let's go. Let's go.

2036
02:09:15,550 --> 02:09:17,100
That's music, bro.

2037
02:09:17,180 --> 02:09:18,140
Hit it.

2038
02:09:20,350 --> 02:09:24,430
"Sometimes in life you
feel it's impossible to make it."

2039
02:09:24,510 --> 02:09:28,430
"Sometimes in life you
feel it's impossible to make it."

2040
02:09:28,510 --> 02:09:32,220
"My friend is bound to win..."

2041
02:09:32,680 --> 02:09:36,470
"My friend is bound to
win because he never gives up."

2042
02:09:36,550 --> 02:09:40,220
"My friend is bound to
win because he never gives up."

2043
02:09:40,300 --> 02:09:43,010
"He dances like a shinning star."

2044
02:09:43,100 --> 02:09:46,140
"He dances like a shinning star."

2045
02:09:46,220 --> 02:09:49,050
"He dances..."

2046
02:09:52,510 --> 02:09:59,180
"Let go of the hatred,
my friend and dance to my drums."

2047
02:10:00,550 --> 02:10:07,680
"It's love that supports everyone
so dance away to my drums, my friend."

2048
02:10:08,970 --> 02:10:12,640
"Love everyone."

2049
02:10:13,010 --> 02:10:16,390
"Reach out and hold somebody's hand."

2050
02:10:16,470 --> 02:10:19,800
"Let's embrace each other once again."

2051
02:10:25,050 --> 02:10:26,550
I tool it out and its still playing.

2052
02:10:26,630 --> 02:10:28,180
What? Are you kidding me?

2053
02:10:28,260 --> 02:10:30,050
- What's that for?
- I did it for us man.

2054
02:10:30,970 --> 02:10:32,140
Go put that back.

2055
02:10:32,480 --> 02:10:33,590
Right now.

2056
02:10:40,070 --> 02:10:43,800
"Your voice and mine..."

2057
02:10:44,050 --> 02:10:47,860
"...together is one voice."

2058
02:10:48,220 --> 02:10:51,680
"Your voice and mine..."

2059
02:10:51,850 --> 02:10:55,640
"...together is one voice."

2060
02:10:56,100 --> 02:10:59,570
"Your voice and mine..."

2061
02:10:59,720 --> 02:11:03,180
"...together is one voice."

2062
02:11:35,580 --> 02:11:38,990
"Your voice and mine..."

2063
02:11:39,070 --> 02:11:42,780
"...together is one voice."

2064
02:11:47,600 --> 02:11:50,890
"Your voice and mine..."

2065
02:11:50,970 --> 02:11:54,930
"...together is one voice."

2066
02:11:55,220 --> 02:11:59,130
"If our dreams could
receive your aid..."

2067
02:11:59,210 --> 02:12:02,800
"O' Lord..."

2068
02:12:02,930 --> 02:12:06,930
"If our dreams could
receive your aid..."

2069
02:12:07,010 --> 02:12:10,680
"We'll make our destiny
if we're courageous."

2070
02:12:10,970 --> 02:12:15,140
"If our desires are true,
we can expect mercy from You."

2071
02:12:15,220 --> 02:12:20,680
"Lord, I pray,
from hatred we stay away."

2072
02:12:20,930 --> 02:12:24,720
"Your voice and mine..."

2073
02:12:25,220 --> 02:12:28,970
"We breathe the same air."

2074
02:12:29,390 --> 02:12:33,180
"We share the same sky."

2075
02:12:33,260 --> 02:12:37,470
"Love everyone."

2076
02:12:37,550 --> 02:12:40,930
"Reach out and hold somebody's hand."

2077
02:12:41,010 --> 02:12:44,680
"Let's embrace each other once again."

2078
02:12:45,010 --> 02:12:48,720
"Your voice and mine..."

2079
02:12:48,970 --> 02:12:52,720
"...together is one voice."

2080
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:32,680
"Your voice and mine..."

2081
02:13:32,890 --> 02:13:36,510
"...together is one voice."

2082
02:13:37,010 --> 02:13:40,720
"Your voice and mine..."

2083
02:13:40,970 --> 02:13:44,220
"...together is one voice."

2084
02:13:44,680 --> 02:13:48,680
"Your voice and mine..."

2085
02:13:49,140 --> 02:13:53,010
"...together is one voice."

2086
02:14:21,070 --> 02:14:24,890
"Your voice and mine..."

2087
02:14:24,970 --> 02:14:28,720
"...together is one voice."

2088
02:14:37,170 --> 02:14:40,760
"Your voice and mine..."

2089
02:14:40,840 --> 02:14:44,810
"...together is one voice."

2090
02:14:49,040 --> 02:14:52,960
"...together is one voice."

2091
02:14:53,040 --> 02:14:56,890
"...together is one voice."

2092
02:15:02,090 --> 02:15:07,960
"When all that there is,
fails, there is family."

2093
02:15:11,820 --> 02:15:16,610
"They can never be forgotten."

2094
02:15:19,590 --> 02:15:24,050
"Your hearts will
always stay linked..."

2095
02:15:27,590 --> 02:15:32,140
"They hear when the soul speaks."

2096
02:15:35,380 --> 02:15:36,590
That day...

2097
02:15:37,820 --> 02:15:39,260
...humanity won, not just us.

2098
02:15:39,950 --> 02:15:41,340
Humans make mistake.

2099
02:15:42,220 --> 02:15:47,690
But it's not God that rectifies
those mistakes. Humans do.

2100
02:15:48,090 --> 02:15:49,620
I made my wrong right.

2101
02:15:51,880 --> 02:15:53,020
Bismillah!

2102
02:16:01,430 --> 02:16:02,140
Poddy.

2103
02:16:04,560 --> 02:16:05,750
We've set everything.
