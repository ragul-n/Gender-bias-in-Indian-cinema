3
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:42,236
Hey.

4
00:02:03,447 --> 00:02:07,281
The bird is beautiful. Free it.

5
00:02:07,847 --> 00:02:12,637
Brother, you speak Farsi very well.

6
00:02:12,767 --> 00:02:17,761
- Farsi is very good language.
- Right. Right.

7
00:02:20,047 --> 00:02:23,005
- Right.
- Wonderful. Wonderful. What nice fruits!

8
00:02:23,167 --> 00:02:24,759
Yes, it is very good.

9
00:02:26,047 --> 00:02:27,703
Eat. If you don't
then you shall regret it.

10
00:02:27,727 --> 00:02:28,796
Eat it.

11
00:02:29,647 --> 00:02:30,762
Oh.

12
00:02:31,567 --> 00:02:34,639
Give me all that you've got, Zabak.

13
00:02:35,687 --> 00:02:40,124
Oh, Katan, you wanderer, you thief.

14
00:02:47,447 --> 00:02:51,326
- I've stolen from him. Did you like it?
- Very much.

15
00:02:51,567 --> 00:02:53,285
But keep it away from my heart.

16
00:02:54,087 --> 00:02:56,681
Thank you. Thank you very much.

17
00:03:00,447 --> 00:03:03,644
- Greetings, mister.
- Greetings, Zabak.

18
00:03:03,727 --> 00:03:06,287
- How is your wound?
- It getting better by the day.

19
00:03:06,367 --> 00:03:09,962
Zabak, if your father
hadn't treated my wound..

20
00:03:10,047 --> 00:03:12,356
I wouldn't have been
here but in the graveyard.

21
00:03:12,447 --> 00:03:14,358
God has blessed my father's hand.

22
00:03:14,447 --> 00:03:17,325
You're right.
But you're not bad either.

23
00:03:17,647 --> 00:03:20,844
- Like father like son.
- Thank you for praising me.

24
00:03:20,927 --> 00:03:22,406
- Allow me to leave.
- Goodbye.

25
00:03:23,447 --> 00:03:26,359
Excuse me, sir.. excuse me, sir.

26
00:03:26,647 --> 00:03:28,638
Were you talking to me? Tell me.

27
00:03:28,807 --> 00:03:31,321
Great. You look like a jolly person.

28
00:03:31,407 --> 00:03:32,726
You know all languages.

29
00:03:33,127 --> 00:03:38,042
Farsi, Pashto, Arabic, Hindi, Urdu.

30
00:03:38,127 --> 00:03:42,564
Mishiri, Vamani, Turkic and all..

31
00:03:42,647 --> 00:03:44,126
Then keep counting.

32
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:47,640
My regards to you.

33
00:03:51,287 --> 00:03:53,357
- Salma.
- Tell me.

34
00:03:53,727 --> 00:04:00,326
Give my regards to Zainab
and offer this flower to her.

35
00:04:02,767 --> 00:04:06,646
They wobble at a glance of beauty,
Galib.

36
00:04:06,767 --> 00:04:09,645
- They wobble.
- Stupid, can't you see?

37
00:04:09,847 --> 00:04:13,362
Commander, you can't see anything
when there is lightening.

38
00:04:13,447 --> 00:04:15,143
What are you saying?
Where is it lightening?

39
00:04:15,167 --> 00:04:18,637
Here, there.. There it is going away.

40
00:04:24,687 --> 00:04:27,679
Imp, you'll know the brightness
of the lightening now.

41
00:04:29,447 --> 00:04:31,438
Not sharp enough. Wait..

42
00:04:33,647 --> 00:04:34,716
Take this.

43
00:04:36,887 --> 00:04:38,286
This will make it sharp again.

44
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,803
- Where is Haji?
- Greetings.

45
00:04:50,887 --> 00:04:53,117
Greetings to you too. Haji.

46
00:04:54,727 --> 00:04:55,796
Haji.

47
00:04:56,767 --> 00:04:59,156
Haji. Haji.

48
00:05:00,447 --> 00:05:02,324
Haji. Haji.

49
00:05:05,087 --> 00:05:06,607
Strange boy.
Wonder where has he gone..

50
00:05:06,647 --> 00:05:08,763
Leaving the customers alone.

51
00:05:09,967 --> 00:05:11,639
- Who is Haji?
- My son.

52
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:15,565
- Zabak?
- Yes. When we went for Haj..

53
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:18,207
God answered our prayers.

54
00:05:18,287 --> 00:05:20,039
That's why we call him Haji.

55
00:05:26,207 --> 00:05:30,803
Hasan Shah, your son has
gone to malign your honour.

56
00:05:30,887 --> 00:05:33,845
- What? I didn't get you.
- Then listen.

57
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:51,083
- God. God. What is this?
- Oh, gosh.

58
00:05:51,767 --> 00:05:55,646
The beauty is praying
for the pride of God..

59
00:05:55,887 --> 00:05:57,161
That too from the tombs?

60
00:06:15,247 --> 00:06:19,399
Can I ask what you have prayed for?

61
00:06:19,887 --> 00:06:26,201
That.. God, keep that boat
which is eager to reach ashore..

62
00:06:27,447 --> 00:06:30,166
Away from the storm.

63
00:06:30,447 --> 00:06:33,883
But I'm riding my boat in a storm..

64
00:06:34,687 --> 00:06:36,757
Called love.

65
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:43,722
When a person is engulfed
in a storm, he prays.

66
00:06:44,087 --> 00:06:47,557
Oh, God Almighty, in Your presence..

67
00:06:47,647 --> 00:06:49,842
This being of yours only prays
for one thing.

68
00:06:50,567 --> 00:06:52,046
You can test me anyway you want.

69
00:06:52,567 --> 00:06:57,766
But make me reach my destiny
with my pious love.

70
00:07:02,887 --> 00:07:03,956
Zabak..

71
00:07:05,287 --> 00:07:08,677
What games is fate
playing with lovers?

72
00:07:09,847 --> 00:07:13,556
It inculcates love in the heart
and then..

73
00:07:13,647 --> 00:07:17,686
Says that keep the flower
away from the world..

74
00:07:18,287 --> 00:07:19,800
Or else it will whither.

75
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:25,717
Zainab, how long will
we hide from the people?

76
00:07:30,447 --> 00:07:33,883
You can hide from the people,
but not from God.

77
00:07:36,647 --> 00:07:39,923
Hasan Shah,
saw what your Haji is up to?

78
00:07:42,967 --> 00:07:45,561
An ordinary person is
committing the mistake of..

79
00:07:45,647 --> 00:07:48,241
Falling in love
with a king's daughter.

80
00:07:48,687 --> 00:07:51,121
All humans stand equal in love.

81
00:07:51,847 --> 00:07:54,725
- There is no one big or small.
- Stop your nonsense.

82
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:57,836
Come with me.

83
00:08:05,687 --> 00:08:08,645
You should remember your status.

84
00:08:13,647 --> 00:08:17,925
Doesn't a commander's
love meet your standards?

85
00:08:23,447 --> 00:08:28,840
Didn't you see how an intelligent
father slapped his son?

86
00:08:30,047 --> 00:08:31,719
- Like this.
- Oh, no.

87
00:08:36,087 --> 00:08:41,241
Did you hear?
Your son wants to touch the moon.

88
00:08:42,567 --> 00:08:46,196
You've pampered him a lot.
Are you listening to me?

89
00:08:46,967 --> 00:08:48,639
I've been listening since long.

90
00:08:50,047 --> 00:08:55,360
You're taunting my Haji as if
he is not our son but our enemy.

91
00:08:55,647 --> 00:08:58,764
We'll know.. when the tiger
and the elephant will fight.

92
00:08:58,847 --> 00:09:00,439
He'll be ripped apart.

93
00:09:00,887 --> 00:09:02,320
I cannot be ripped apart by anyone.

94
00:09:02,967 --> 00:09:06,243
Wonderful, my son.
Who are you so proud of?

95
00:09:06,847 --> 00:09:08,327
I'm proud of the power of God,
Mother.

96
00:09:08,647 --> 00:09:10,877
We toil hard and make a living.

97
00:09:11,047 --> 00:09:12,765
We too stay in Iswahaan.

98
00:09:12,847 --> 00:09:14,724
And he is the king of this place.

99
00:09:14,807 --> 00:09:16,559
He must be the king in his house.

100
00:09:16,647 --> 00:09:18,285
He has two hands and so do we.

101
00:09:18,367 --> 00:09:21,200
But 10,000 men can launch swords
at one signal of his.

102
00:09:21,447 --> 00:09:22,766
Can't you see that?

103
00:09:23,567 --> 00:09:25,558
When he auctions the parlour..

104
00:09:25,647 --> 00:09:28,639
And sets the house on fire
and your Haji will be..

105
00:09:28,807 --> 00:09:30,206
This is not a good omen.

106
00:09:31,047 --> 00:09:32,116
Haji..

107
00:09:33,567 --> 00:09:36,445
- Don't meet Zainab again.
- But Mother, I..

108
00:09:36,687 --> 00:09:39,281
- I..
- What is this "I" that you're stuck at?

109
00:09:39,967 --> 00:09:43,642
Look, Son. Your father's honour
lies in your hands.

110
00:09:43,767 --> 00:09:44,836
Mother.

111
00:09:45,847 --> 00:09:49,078
Now, you should stop being
in touch with Zainab.

112
00:09:52,047 --> 00:09:53,799
You're under the oath of your mother.

113
00:09:55,447 --> 00:09:59,360
- What have you said, Mother?
- Your mother is right.

114
00:10:00,287 --> 00:10:02,039
Our well-being lies in that.

115
00:10:18,047 --> 00:10:21,119
Allow me to meet Zainab just once.

116
00:10:21,447 --> 00:10:26,316
- What for?
- To bid farewell.

117
00:10:26,567 --> 00:10:30,355
- That's impossible.
- Why are you always so cruel?

118
00:10:30,647 --> 00:10:32,956
Nothing will happen
if they meet once.

119
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,716
Sir..

120
00:10:38,447 --> 00:10:40,438
The king has asked for you.

121
00:10:40,647 --> 00:10:43,115
Okay. You may leave, I'll be there.

122
00:10:55,247 --> 00:10:58,956
- Greetings, King.
- Greetings to you too.

123
00:10:59,647 --> 00:11:01,638
- Where were you, Hasan?
- Well..

124
00:11:01,767 --> 00:11:05,043
He is our guest. Royal merchant.
Usman Shah.

125
00:11:06,047 --> 00:11:08,925
I've praised your parlour
and brought him here.

126
00:11:09,007 --> 00:11:12,443
Thank you very much.
Tell me what I can do for you.

127
00:11:12,807 --> 00:11:14,638
First, massage him.

128
00:11:15,047 --> 00:11:17,686
He is going to go back
to Taharam tonight itself.

129
00:11:19,367 --> 00:11:20,436
Please come.

130
00:11:20,727 --> 00:11:25,755
How is that possible?
First, massage my generous King.

131
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:29,796
Then please come with me.

132
00:11:30,167 --> 00:11:34,206
Look dear, it's not good
to argue with the king.

133
00:11:36,287 --> 00:11:39,643
And it's not good to
refuse the guest either.

134
00:11:39,727 --> 00:11:41,843
And you're elder to me.

135
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:47,679
- All are equal in our parlour.
- Wonderful. Well said.

136
00:11:47,967 --> 00:11:49,764
This is called prompt answer.

137
00:11:49,927 --> 00:11:53,636
- Who are you?
- He is the owner's son. Zabak.

138
00:11:53,767 --> 00:11:56,361
- Very good.
- Usman Shah, you should..

139
00:11:56,447 --> 00:11:59,041
Talk to people of lower caste
from a distance.

140
00:11:59,207 --> 00:12:04,679
Right, if you talk to them,
they forget where they stand.

141
00:12:05,167 --> 00:12:08,125
There is no one big or small
by profession, commander.

142
00:12:08,207 --> 00:12:11,438
- Zabak.
- There are only two religions in this world.

143
00:12:11,967 --> 00:12:13,082
Humans and demons.

144
00:12:13,647 --> 00:12:15,239
The ones who do good deeds
are humans.

145
00:12:15,647 --> 00:12:16,783
And the ones who do bad deeds are..

146
00:12:16,807 --> 00:12:18,240
Worse than demons.

147
00:12:19,287 --> 00:12:21,562
But Zabak,
it's difficult to distinguish..

148
00:12:21,647 --> 00:12:23,842
Between the good and the bad.

149
00:12:23,927 --> 00:12:24,996
But not impossible.

150
00:12:25,447 --> 00:12:28,757
Men make the impossible possible.

151
00:12:29,447 --> 00:12:32,439
They are not men at heart,
but they grow moustaches.

152
00:12:32,887 --> 00:12:35,276
Those who stare have a keen sight.

153
00:12:35,647 --> 00:12:37,877
Hey. Now,
you've crossed all the limits.

154
00:12:40,367 --> 00:12:41,436
Bang on target.

155
00:12:43,447 --> 00:12:45,642
Now, he's really head down in water.

156
00:12:46,407 --> 00:12:50,002
Look, even the water is dancing
with joy on our meeting.

157
00:12:50,887 --> 00:12:54,960
No, Zainab, it is squirming today.

158
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:58,398
In jealousy of our pious love?

159
00:12:59,087 --> 00:13:02,966
No.. in the sadness
of our last meeting.

160
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:08,356
Zabak.

161
00:13:09,647 --> 00:13:11,239
How should I explain
it to you, Zainab..

162
00:13:12,087 --> 00:13:14,806
There is a stone wall of
riches standing between us.

163
00:13:15,687 --> 00:13:18,281
It is not difficult
for us to break this wall.

164
00:13:19,807 --> 00:13:23,038
I'll tell father
about our pious love.

165
00:13:23,847 --> 00:13:27,635
And I'm sure that
he'll take my happiness to be his.

166
00:13:29,207 --> 00:13:32,438
Zainab, don't forget
that your father is a king.

167
00:13:34,567 --> 00:13:37,240
And a king only looks
at people of higher class.

168
00:13:38,047 --> 00:13:40,277
I got to know of this in the parlour.

169
00:13:40,447 --> 00:13:42,881
- Zabak..
- Try to forget me.

170
00:13:42,967 --> 00:13:44,719
- But Zabak..
- Forget me.

171
00:13:57,447 --> 00:14:00,564
"I'm going far away
from your world."

172
00:14:00,647 --> 00:14:03,286
"I'm helpless."

173
00:14:03,367 --> 00:14:06,643
"Always remember me."

174
00:14:09,127 --> 00:14:12,164
"I'm going far away
from your world."

175
00:14:12,247 --> 00:14:14,807
"I'm helpless."

176
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:17,879
"Always remember me."

177
00:14:17,967 --> 00:14:20,765
"Wherever you go, my love."

178
00:14:20,847 --> 00:14:26,763
"You're under my oath,
always remember me."

179
00:14:29,447 --> 00:14:32,644
"Wherever you go, my love."

180
00:14:32,727 --> 00:14:37,642
"You're under my oath,
always remember me."

181
00:14:37,727 --> 00:14:42,357
"I'm going far away
from your world."

182
00:14:53,447 --> 00:15:01,447
"When the springs will come,
they shall talk of you."

183
00:15:04,887 --> 00:15:12,887
"When the springs will come,
they shall talk of you."

184
00:15:13,567 --> 00:15:21,567
"In solitude,
your memories will make me cry."

185
00:15:21,727 --> 00:15:26,926
"Will make me cry.
Will make me squirm."

186
00:15:27,167 --> 00:15:30,125
"We would enjoy the spring."

187
00:15:30,207 --> 00:15:32,721
"We would define love."

188
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:35,640
"Always remember."

189
00:15:35,727 --> 00:15:38,639
"Wherever you go, my love.."

190
00:15:38,727 --> 00:15:43,676
"You're under my oath,
always remember me."

191
00:15:43,767 --> 00:15:48,124
"I'm going far away
from your world."

192
00:15:59,087 --> 00:16:04,559
"Take my well wishes with you."

193
00:16:04,647 --> 00:16:07,639
"Why complain to anyone?"

194
00:16:10,447 --> 00:16:15,680
"Take my well wishes with you."

195
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:18,759
"Why complain to anyone?"

196
00:16:18,887 --> 00:16:24,166
"It's neither your mistake
nor mine."

197
00:16:24,247 --> 00:16:26,761
"What had to happen has happened."

198
00:16:26,927 --> 00:16:29,566
"What had to happen has happened."

199
00:16:29,647 --> 00:16:32,320
"Why complain to anyone?"

200
00:16:32,407 --> 00:16:35,240
"My love is crying."

201
00:16:35,447 --> 00:16:40,760
"My heart calls out,
always remember me."

202
00:16:40,847 --> 00:16:43,645
"I'm going far away
from your world."

203
00:16:43,727 --> 00:16:46,195
"I'm helpless."

204
00:16:46,287 --> 00:16:49,006
"Always remember me."

205
00:16:49,087 --> 00:16:52,045
"Wherever you go, my love.."

206
00:16:52,127 --> 00:16:57,076
"You're under my oath,
always remember me."

207
00:16:57,167 --> 00:17:02,002
"I'm going far away
from your world."

208
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:29,680
You foolish girl.

209
00:17:29,767 --> 00:17:32,440
You want to tarnish my image.

210
00:17:32,647 --> 00:17:37,402
Sir, Zainab is not at fault.
This worthless man is at fault.

211
00:17:37,647 --> 00:17:39,922
The one who thinks
he is equal to the king.

212
00:17:40,087 --> 00:17:43,762
Take this accused away, the court
of law will decide about him.

213
00:17:49,687 --> 00:17:51,643
I've done my job.

214
00:17:52,047 --> 00:17:54,686
I hope you too will
fulfil your promise.

215
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:59,798
Kasim, you'll get married to Zainab.

216
00:18:02,287 --> 00:18:04,642
But had I not given my word..

217
00:18:04,807 --> 00:18:06,559
I would have never
let my daughter..

218
00:18:06,647 --> 00:18:08,638
Marry a gossiper like you.

219
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:12,680
I bow down to the decision made
by the king.

220
00:18:28,367 --> 00:18:31,757
This world belongs to God.
The country to the King.

221
00:18:32,207 --> 00:18:34,641
Justice will be done by the judge.

222
00:18:34,967 --> 00:18:36,958
The order is given by the king.

223
00:18:39,567 --> 00:18:43,401
Accused Zabak thought
he was an equal to the king.

224
00:18:43,967 --> 00:18:46,276
And insulted his status.

225
00:18:46,807 --> 00:18:50,482
That's why according to Suhan's law..

226
00:18:50,967 --> 00:18:53,083
Zabak should be dragged
on his knees..

227
00:18:53,167 --> 00:18:56,955
Beaten by whips
and debarred from the city.

228
00:18:58,207 --> 00:19:01,085
The father of the accused purposely..

229
00:19:01,167 --> 00:19:05,445
Helped his son
with his illegitimate deeds.

230
00:19:05,967 --> 00:19:08,083
Hence, Hasan Shah is
to be made bald..

231
00:19:08,167 --> 00:19:10,476
And is to be ridden on a donkey.

232
00:19:10,967 --> 00:19:13,083
So that henceforth
no lower caste person..

233
00:19:13,167 --> 00:19:17,160
Dares to insult
an upper class person.

234
00:19:17,567 --> 00:19:22,277
Signed by the king.
Mahmood Shah Suhani.

235
00:19:22,967 --> 00:19:28,200
My misfortune. God, have mercy.

236
00:19:29,167 --> 00:19:32,239
Have patience, dear.
Have faith in God.

237
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:39,800
This is unjust. It is my fault.

238
00:19:39,967 --> 00:19:41,719
Why is my father being punished?

239
00:19:42,167 --> 00:19:43,395
You can kill me if you want.

240
00:19:50,207 --> 00:19:51,276
Zabak.

241
00:19:54,087 --> 00:19:55,236
Have mercy.

242
00:19:57,967 --> 00:20:02,245
- Forgive me, Father.
- It's not your fault, son.

243
00:20:02,967 --> 00:20:07,882
It is bravery to endure your fate
in silence.

244
00:20:07,967 --> 00:20:09,161
Keep quiet, criminal.

245
00:20:09,327 --> 00:20:12,842
Shave his head
and follow the King's order.

246
00:20:23,767 --> 00:20:25,325
No.. no.

247
00:20:25,407 --> 00:20:26,476
No, no.

248
00:20:26,727 --> 00:20:29,400
I've always lived in honour.

249
00:20:29,967 --> 00:20:31,958
I've given so much to the palace.

250
00:20:32,207 --> 00:20:34,243
And I'm being humiliated for that.

251
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:38,159
For God's sake, instead of
this punishment, behead me.

252
00:20:38,247 --> 00:20:39,362
It will be a favour.

253
00:20:39,967 --> 00:20:45,678
Hasan, not even the King can
go against a judge's decision.

254
00:20:55,727 --> 00:20:59,197
Then look at my final decision
with your bloodshot eyes.

255
00:20:59,327 --> 00:21:00,442
God Almighty.

256
00:21:03,287 --> 00:21:04,356
Oh, God.

257
00:21:04,767 --> 00:21:05,836
Father.

258
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:12,876
God Almighty.

259
00:21:17,207 --> 00:21:18,276
Father.

260
00:21:18,727 --> 00:21:19,796
Wait, Kasim.

261
00:21:21,727 --> 00:21:25,925
Now, Zabak will be punished
only after his father's funeral.

262
00:21:32,807 --> 00:21:33,876
Father.

263
00:21:34,727 --> 00:21:37,878
There is only one God
and Mohammad is His only prophet.

264
00:21:38,807 --> 00:21:41,401
God is with the patient ones.

265
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:43,486
Have patience, dear.

266
00:22:16,487 --> 00:22:17,556
Mother.

267
00:22:25,247 --> 00:22:27,158
- Haji.
- Mother.

268
00:22:27,967 --> 00:22:32,199
My son. You're a child of Iswahaan.

269
00:22:33,887 --> 00:22:36,799
Look towards the motherland
and go on.

270
00:22:37,967 --> 00:22:40,561
So that you've the memory
of your country..

271
00:22:41,287 --> 00:22:45,280
And I've a image of you
in my eyes.

272
00:22:45,567 --> 00:22:46,636
Mother.

273
00:22:47,807 --> 00:22:50,275
- Haji.
- Mother.

274
00:22:56,487 --> 00:22:57,715
- Son.
- Mother.

275
00:23:00,567 --> 00:23:01,636
Mother.

276
00:23:03,647 --> 00:23:09,438
God Almighty,
have mercy on my Zabak.

277
00:23:10,087 --> 00:23:11,156
Mother.

278
00:23:14,887 --> 00:23:17,037
Zabak. Zabak.

279
00:23:19,767 --> 00:23:22,327
Zabak. Zabak.

280
00:23:42,687 --> 00:23:49,638
Oh, my motherland, be witness..

281
00:23:51,047 --> 00:23:53,880
To the fact that
I'm being forced to part with you.

282
00:25:15,967 --> 00:25:17,480
- Father.
- Thank God.

283
00:26:23,767 --> 00:26:26,998
Chief, look how bravely
is he fighting.

284
00:26:33,687 --> 00:26:35,086
Come, let's see who he is.

285
00:26:47,207 --> 00:26:48,481
Take him away.

286
00:26:49,127 --> 00:26:50,879
I'll punish him such
that all disloyal men..

287
00:26:50,967 --> 00:26:53,606
Like him will learn
a lesson from it.

288
00:27:05,087 --> 00:27:06,281
Well-done, Zabak.

289
00:27:07,127 --> 00:27:10,358
You're not only good at art of
conversation, but at fencing too.

290
00:27:10,607 --> 00:27:12,040
How did you recognise me?

291
00:27:15,647 --> 00:27:18,605
Merchant Usman Shah.
What kind of a secret is this?

292
00:27:19,007 --> 00:27:20,076
Bang on target.

293
00:27:21,367 --> 00:27:23,244
This is the first mask
I've unmasked.

294
00:27:24,447 --> 00:27:26,517
But.. You are here,
and in this state?

295
00:27:27,127 --> 00:27:29,641
I'll tell that later.
But who was he?

296
00:27:30,287 --> 00:27:31,959
He was once my right-hand man.

297
00:27:32,607 --> 00:27:35,075
But from today, he has become
a rogue and a disloyal.

298
00:27:35,887 --> 00:27:38,355
He was kidnapping
my daughter Samina.

299
00:27:38,527 --> 00:27:41,280
And then you came as her saviour.

300
00:27:41,367 --> 00:27:43,244
And protected
the honour of our tribe.

301
00:27:46,287 --> 00:27:48,482
I'll never forget
this favour of yours.

302
00:27:56,567 --> 00:27:58,683
Make arrangements
for Zabak to stay with us.

303
00:27:59,127 --> 00:28:00,606
He is my special guest.

304
00:28:01,607 --> 00:28:06,237
- Come with me, I'll take care of you.
- Thank you. But who are you?

305
00:28:06,407 --> 00:28:09,956
- I'm Mr. Khachar Shah, the royal Shah.
- What?

306
00:28:10,567 --> 00:28:13,127
People often call me Khataralu.

307
00:28:20,487 --> 00:28:24,526
Hey. You're humiliating me
in front of everyone.

308
00:28:24,887 --> 00:28:28,243
I'll give you such a kick
which you'll never forget.

309
00:28:41,487 --> 00:28:44,399
You made me fall and others laugh.

310
00:28:44,767 --> 00:28:46,325
Come on, come with me.

311
00:29:26,967 --> 00:29:30,118
The distance is as vast as
from the ground to the sky.

312
00:29:30,207 --> 00:29:36,760
But I feel as if
you're sitting close to me.

313
00:30:00,767 --> 00:30:02,439
You got so scared
as soon as you saw me.

314
00:30:03,367 --> 00:30:07,360
- Why won't you?
- I didn't understand, dear.

315
00:30:13,087 --> 00:30:16,124
The distance is as vast
as from the ground to the sky.

316
00:30:16,207 --> 00:30:21,964
But I feel as if
you're sitting close to me.

317
00:30:28,727 --> 00:30:34,484
Forgive me. I heard your feelings
expressed out aloud.

318
00:30:37,767 --> 00:30:40,361
That girl must be very fortunate..

319
00:30:41,567 --> 00:30:48,962
Whose memories linger on the lips
of a brave man as a poetry.

320
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:54,439
You're sharp.

321
00:30:58,047 --> 00:31:02,086
That's because I'm a woman.

322
00:31:04,967 --> 00:31:08,880
Here, I saw you and forgot,
father wants..

323
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:12,323
To hear your story from you.

324
00:31:13,527 --> 00:31:16,360
- And I too.
- Even I would wish to know..

325
00:31:17,007 --> 00:31:19,885
Why did Mr. Usman Aaga,
the chief of dacoits..

326
00:31:19,967 --> 00:31:21,719
Come to Iswahaan in disguise?

327
00:31:30,167 --> 00:31:32,078
Brave men of the tribe, Usman..

328
00:31:32,567 --> 00:31:34,762
Today is the day of
double celebration for us.

329
00:31:35,767 --> 00:31:37,883
Firstly, this brave young man Zabak..

330
00:31:37,967 --> 00:31:43,963
Risked his life
and saved my daughter's honour.

331
00:31:44,167 --> 00:31:47,955
You can say that he saved
the honour of our tribe.

332
00:31:48,287 --> 00:31:51,040
Service to humanity is my prime duty.

333
00:31:51,127 --> 00:31:52,196
Of course.

334
00:31:53,687 --> 00:31:56,565
And the other good news is that..

335
00:31:56,647 --> 00:31:58,877
The purpose for which
I went to Iswahaan..

336
00:31:58,967 --> 00:32:02,164
In disguise, has been achieved.

337
00:32:02,767 --> 00:32:07,557
Brave men, now we should
get ready to attack Iswahaan.

338
00:32:07,647 --> 00:32:09,080
We're ready.

339
00:32:14,327 --> 00:32:17,956
- Attack Iswahaan?
- Yes, attack Iswahaan.

340
00:32:18,087 --> 00:32:19,600
You too will support us, won't you?

341
00:32:21,087 --> 00:32:23,476
- But I'm not a dacoit.
- Bang on target again.

342
00:32:24,007 --> 00:32:25,122
You're very naTTve.

343
00:32:27,567 --> 00:32:29,125
Iswahaan is my country.

344
00:32:32,767 --> 00:32:34,723
Where you were humiliated.

345
00:32:36,007 --> 00:32:38,567
But I can't dishonour
my motherland for that.

346
00:32:38,647 --> 00:32:39,716
Bang on target again.

347
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:43,000
I won't dishonour your motherland.

348
00:32:43,367 --> 00:32:46,564
We'll just loot its gems and jewels.

349
00:32:46,767 --> 00:32:48,723
And distribute it
among our tribe members.

350
00:32:49,127 --> 00:32:51,687
- May the glory of our chief..
- Last forever.

351
00:32:53,407 --> 00:32:55,363
Hail the chief.

352
00:32:55,647 --> 00:32:58,241
- I'm coming from Iswahaan.
- What news have you brought?

353
00:32:58,767 --> 00:33:02,237
- Entire Iswahaan is celebrating.
- The reason for celebration?

354
00:33:02,767 --> 00:33:05,679
Tomorrow night, commander Kasim Baig
is going to get married.

355
00:33:06,127 --> 00:33:09,961
- With whom?
- With the king's daughter Zainab.

356
00:33:12,527 --> 00:33:13,676
With Zainab?

357
00:33:16,367 --> 00:33:17,436
Heard that, brave men's?

358
00:33:17,607 --> 00:33:19,279
Fate is favouring us.

359
00:33:19,967 --> 00:33:21,878
Tomorrow night,
when entire Iswahaan..

360
00:33:21,967 --> 00:33:25,243
Will be busy celebrating
the wedding, we'll attack them.

361
00:33:25,447 --> 00:33:27,483
Chief, even I will come with you.

362
00:33:27,567 --> 00:33:30,127
Well-done, this is
what I expected from you.

363
00:33:30,767 --> 00:33:32,041
Prepare for the attack.

364
00:35:10,607 --> 00:35:12,677
Loot them. Loot them.

365
00:35:13,007 --> 00:35:14,527
And loot from them
as much as you want.

366
00:35:15,287 --> 00:35:19,644
But as per our principles,
don't return alive unsuccessful.

367
00:35:20,167 --> 00:35:21,361
Attack.

368
00:35:51,167 --> 00:35:52,441
Quickly go and seal the door.

369
00:38:32,887 --> 00:38:34,718
We're quits today.

370
00:38:37,647 --> 00:38:39,399
- Who are you?
- The one whom you thought..

371
00:38:39,487 --> 00:38:42,240
As an ordinary
and a low caste person.

372
00:38:42,887 --> 00:38:45,845
Zabak. A dacoit?

373
00:39:01,287 --> 00:39:03,926
Sir. Sir. .what happened, sir?
Get up. Get up.

374
00:39:07,487 --> 00:39:11,082
- He thought that he killed me.
- Who?

375
00:39:11,647 --> 00:39:14,161
- The foolish Zabak.
- Zabak?

376
00:39:14,247 --> 00:39:19,082
But he doesn't know that
Kasim can even cheat his death.

377
00:39:24,887 --> 00:39:25,956
Leave me.

378
00:39:30,967 --> 00:39:34,642
Wretch. You're hiding behind this.
Come on.

379
00:39:35,647 --> 00:39:37,797
- Leave me.
- Shut up I say. Come on.

380
00:39:52,487 --> 00:39:53,556
Zainab.

381
00:40:03,087 --> 00:40:07,000
Don't worry, Mahmood Shah.
I don't wish to kill you.

382
00:40:07,167 --> 00:40:11,638
- Why?
- Because I've been your guest once.

383
00:40:12,007 --> 00:40:13,076
Who are you?

384
00:40:15,527 --> 00:40:17,119
Merchant Usman Shah?

385
00:40:17,607 --> 00:40:20,679
Yes. I've come to trade Iswahaan.

386
00:40:37,487 --> 00:40:40,604
What's all this, Kasim?
Who are they?

387
00:40:40,687 --> 00:40:45,841
They? They brought
an opportunity for me.

388
00:40:46,927 --> 00:40:48,280
Betrayal.

389
00:40:57,527 --> 00:41:00,644
- Betrayal.
- Not a betrayal..

390
00:41:01,087 --> 00:41:04,636
But a revenge for insult.
You called me a gossiper.

391
00:41:04,967 --> 00:41:06,543
You didn't give your consent
for the alliance happily.

392
00:41:06,567 --> 00:41:07,636
You were forced for it.

393
00:41:07,727 --> 00:41:10,560
No one can live
after insulting Kasim.

394
00:41:23,727 --> 00:41:25,524
Murshad. Sage Murshad.

395
00:41:30,967 --> 00:41:34,596
- Greetings.
- Greetings to you too.

396
00:41:36,487 --> 00:41:37,886
Why are you not facing me?

397
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:40,676
Because you're hiding your face.

398
00:41:41,287 --> 00:41:46,042
- Who are you?
- The one who can't show you his face.

399
00:41:46,567 --> 00:41:50,480
But Murshad, for God's sake,
tell me where's Zabak's mother.

400
00:41:50,807 --> 00:41:53,640
- Why?
- I've brought her son's message for her.

401
00:41:53,887 --> 00:41:55,718
He has brought my son's message?

402
00:41:56,287 --> 00:41:59,279
My Zabak's message. Who is it?

403
00:42:00,287 --> 00:42:03,199
Who is my son's friend? Who is it?

404
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:04,756
Oh, God.

405
00:42:06,527 --> 00:42:09,963
She can't see. A pity.

406
00:42:11,007 --> 00:42:12,963
She did this to herself.

407
00:42:17,927 --> 00:42:20,395
Yes, what's the use seeing
the world..

408
00:42:20,487 --> 00:42:25,720
For a woman who can't see her
husband and her son.

409
00:42:28,887 --> 00:42:30,081
Why don't you say something?

410
00:42:32,127 --> 00:42:34,118
Murshad, who is he?

411
00:42:34,847 --> 00:42:40,285
- A dacoit.
- A dacoit? No. No, no.

412
00:42:40,527 --> 00:42:42,119
He is not my Haji's friend.

413
00:42:42,807 --> 00:42:44,399
The one who was born to me..

414
00:42:44,487 --> 00:42:48,275
In Mecca, he..
He can't be a dacoit's friend.

415
00:42:50,727 --> 00:42:54,481
But he has brought
your son's message, dear.

416
00:42:54,887 --> 00:42:56,923
No. No.

417
00:42:57,887 --> 00:43:02,597
He is a tormentor
who is stealing my son's body.

418
00:43:03,567 --> 00:43:10,598
Look.. look.. even my blind eyes
can see an innocent being tortured.

419
00:43:15,687 --> 00:43:17,917
I wish I couldn't hear too.

420
00:43:18,807 --> 00:43:20,877
Or my Zabak would have been here.

421
00:43:21,687 --> 00:43:24,520
Then he would have washed
the land of Iswahaan with your blood.

422
00:43:24,967 --> 00:43:27,003
Go. Go away from here.

423
00:43:27,127 --> 00:43:28,765
For God's sake, go away from here.

424
00:43:29,567 --> 00:43:32,957
Don't dirty this pious place
with your presence.

425
00:43:33,127 --> 00:43:34,765
Go. Go from here.

426
00:43:34,887 --> 00:43:35,956
Come on.

427
00:43:37,287 --> 00:43:41,917
People, we've got what we wanted.
Let's go from here.

428
00:44:12,207 --> 00:44:15,995
Sir. Sir. Let's go.
Chief is going back.

429
00:45:00,487 --> 00:45:02,318
How long will you keep examining me?

430
00:45:03,447 --> 00:45:06,200
Two doctors are here and none..

431
00:45:06,287 --> 00:45:08,926
Of you can remove a minute object?

432
00:45:09,007 --> 00:45:11,202
Chief, if we make
even a small mistake..

433
00:45:11,287 --> 00:45:13,278
It will be dangerous for your life.

434
00:45:13,367 --> 00:45:16,200
And if its not removed,
the poison will spread and..

435
00:45:16,287 --> 00:45:21,759
- I'll die. Right?
- Father. Don't say that, Father.

436
00:45:24,447 --> 00:45:27,564
Dear, why do you cry?

437
00:45:29,207 --> 00:45:32,802
Dacoit lives in the shadow of death.

438
00:45:32,887 --> 00:45:34,445
But I won't let you die.

439
00:45:36,287 --> 00:45:38,881
Can you even stop the angel of death?

440
00:45:39,407 --> 00:45:41,443
No one can stop the angel of death.

441
00:45:41,687 --> 00:45:44,281
But only a brave can fight it.

442
00:45:44,807 --> 00:45:46,035
I'll remove this arrow.

443
00:45:46,287 --> 00:45:48,323
But you're not a doctor.

444
00:45:48,487 --> 00:45:51,047
I'm Jarah Hasan Shah Suhani's son.

445
00:45:51,287 --> 00:45:53,198
And we've been
treating since generations.

446
00:45:53,287 --> 00:45:57,485
Well-done, Zabak.
This is called bravery.

447
00:45:58,807 --> 00:46:00,559
Make the preparations
to remove the arrow.

448
00:46:02,087 --> 00:46:06,399
Langardeen, keep that
mirror in front of me.

449
00:46:08,607 --> 00:46:09,835
Why, chief?

450
00:46:10,327 --> 00:46:16,084
I want to see
how good Zabak is at this.

451
00:46:16,287 --> 00:46:18,926
Wonderful, such are brave men.

452
00:46:48,767 --> 00:46:51,645
May God be with you.

453
00:46:55,087 --> 00:47:00,207
"What cannot happen if.."

454
00:47:00,287 --> 00:47:05,725
". .A person tries hard?"

455
00:47:05,927 --> 00:47:11,206
"What is it that.."

456
00:47:11,287 --> 00:47:16,407
"Is impossible?"

457
00:47:20,967 --> 00:47:26,200
"If the destiny wants.."

458
00:47:26,287 --> 00:47:32,078
". .Destiny can change."

459
00:47:32,327 --> 00:47:38,197
"The worst.."

460
00:47:38,287 --> 00:47:42,917
". .Can change."

461
00:47:47,447 --> 00:47:53,204
"A human is the one.."

462
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:58,645
". .Who can help someone."

463
00:47:58,887 --> 00:48:04,200
"He can sacrifice himself.."

464
00:48:04,287 --> 00:48:09,315
". .And save someone's life."

465
00:48:36,367 --> 00:48:37,846
Well-done, Zabak.

466
00:48:57,607 --> 00:48:59,757
Friends, celebrate.

467
00:48:59,927 --> 00:49:04,603
Guardian angel Zabak has saved
our beloved chief's life.

468
00:49:04,687 --> 00:49:06,279
So, dance.

469
00:49:06,367 --> 00:49:07,595
Come on.

470
00:50:47,847 --> 00:50:50,839
- Love live.
- Chief.

471
00:51:08,447 --> 00:51:09,596
Wonderful.

472
00:51:13,007 --> 00:51:16,283
Give half of these to the poor.

473
00:51:16,527 --> 00:51:18,279
And the other half
to our tribe members.

474
00:51:18,367 --> 00:51:19,766
- Hail..
- Our chief.

475
00:51:19,847 --> 00:51:21,360
- Hail..
- Our chief.

476
00:51:28,767 --> 00:51:29,836
Jewellery.

477
00:51:32,927 --> 00:51:33,996
Clothes.

478
00:51:34,767 --> 00:51:38,282
Give these clothes
and jewellery to my daughter.

479
00:51:43,607 --> 00:51:46,360
Giving goods stolen
from a wedding to your daughter?

480
00:51:46,447 --> 00:51:47,596
Bang on target again.

481
00:51:48,007 --> 00:51:51,283
Zabak, the rich steal
poor person's destiny.

482
00:51:51,607 --> 00:51:53,837
And we steal the wealth of the rich.

483
00:51:54,287 --> 00:51:57,836
Father, even he is to be given
the honour for this loot.

484
00:51:58,287 --> 00:51:59,356
No.

485
00:52:00,607 --> 00:52:02,359
I've been looted myself.

486
00:52:02,527 --> 00:52:04,199
When will you understand, Zabak?

487
00:52:04,607 --> 00:52:07,360
The one who fights
without fear wins.

488
00:52:07,847 --> 00:52:10,441
Ask. Ask for whatever
you want today.

489
00:52:10,767 --> 00:52:13,281
Not now.
I'll ask when the time is right.

490
00:52:13,607 --> 00:52:14,756
As you wish.

491
00:52:21,447 --> 00:52:22,516
What is it?

492
00:52:24,607 --> 00:52:26,006
Hail the chief.

493
00:52:26,207 --> 00:52:29,199
Taking so much trouble and pain..

494
00:52:29,287 --> 00:52:33,678
I have brought her here.
She now belongs to me.

495
00:52:34,767 --> 00:52:37,361
- He is a stupid king.
- I don't mind being stupid.

496
00:52:37,687 --> 00:52:39,598
At least you agreed that I'm a king.

497
00:52:39,927 --> 00:52:43,363
Khataralu, do you want
to keep her as your girl?

498
00:52:43,687 --> 00:52:48,363
No, sir. No. I want to be her slave.

499
00:52:49,607 --> 00:52:51,006
Okay, go. No problem.

500
00:52:53,007 --> 00:52:54,360
But I don't accept it.

501
00:52:54,447 --> 00:52:55,516
Enough. Enough. Enough.

502
00:52:55,607 --> 00:52:58,201
Nothing can happen now.
Chief has ordered.

503
00:52:58,287 --> 00:53:00,596
Long live my chief. Live long.

504
00:53:00,767 --> 00:53:02,200
Come on, dear.

505
00:53:03,367 --> 00:53:06,598
What's so funny? Come on.

506
00:53:12,847 --> 00:53:15,281
Look, one has left
and the other has come.

507
00:53:15,927 --> 00:53:19,363
Come on. Come on.
Come on, stay there.

508
00:53:19,847 --> 00:53:21,280
You talk too much.

509
00:53:21,607 --> 00:53:23,199
Hail the chief.

510
00:53:24,007 --> 00:53:26,077
I've arrested this beautiful girl.

511
00:53:26,847 --> 00:53:30,999
Hence allow me to marry her.

512
00:53:32,207 --> 00:53:34,926
If you've arrested her
then she belongs to you.

513
00:53:35,007 --> 00:53:39,683
Hail to the chief. Get up. Come on.

514
00:53:39,927 --> 00:53:40,996
Wait, Langardeen.

515
00:53:42,207 --> 00:53:45,916
Remove her veil so that
we can see your bride.

516
00:53:52,847 --> 00:53:53,916
Zainab.

517
00:53:55,367 --> 00:53:56,595
Wonderful.

518
00:53:58,687 --> 00:54:03,363
Had I seen her first,
she would have been my..

519
00:54:03,447 --> 00:54:05,278
- Chief.
- What is it, Zabak?

520
00:54:06,367 --> 00:54:07,436
Zabak.

521
00:54:09,447 --> 00:54:12,007
Chief, it's time I ask for my reward.

522
00:54:12,087 --> 00:54:14,681
I never refused you. Ask for it.

523
00:54:15,527 --> 00:54:17,438
She is king of
Iswahaan's daughter Zainab.

524
00:54:18,007 --> 00:54:19,201
Wonderful.

525
00:54:19,847 --> 00:54:21,997
- So, is she your beloved?
- Yes.

526
00:54:27,207 --> 00:54:29,198
Then she belongs to you, Zabak.

527
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:32,086
That's impossible.

528
00:54:32,927 --> 00:54:35,282
If the chief doesn't keep his word..

529
00:54:35,527 --> 00:54:37,836
Then the tribe members
will stop trusting him.

530
00:54:38,447 --> 00:54:39,596
You're right.

531
00:54:41,367 --> 00:54:42,925
You've given your word to me too.

532
00:54:43,087 --> 00:54:44,281
You're right too.

533
00:54:49,687 --> 00:54:53,441
I leave the decision
of that to this girl.

534
00:54:54,287 --> 00:54:58,519
Zainab, you can marry
anyone you want.

535
00:55:04,207 --> 00:55:07,279
The one who I loved was
not an enemy of our country.

536
00:55:08,447 --> 00:55:11,007
The one who didn't
respect his motherland.

537
00:55:11,527 --> 00:55:14,280
The one who covered
the land of Iswahaan with blood.

538
00:55:14,767 --> 00:55:16,519
The one who saw women being widowed..

539
00:55:16,927 --> 00:55:21,364
And children being orphaned,
I hate such a heartless person.

540
00:55:21,447 --> 00:55:22,516
Zainab.

541
00:55:22,927 --> 00:55:25,361
Instead of loving
a traitor and rebel..

542
00:55:25,927 --> 00:55:28,282
I would prefer being
a slave to a dacoit.

543
00:55:31,287 --> 00:55:33,278
Then come with me. Come.

544
00:55:47,167 --> 00:55:49,681
- Look. Look. Look. Look.
- What?

545
00:55:51,327 --> 00:55:53,761
- Hot water.
- Drown in it.

546
00:55:53,847 --> 00:55:54,916
Oh, no.

547
00:55:57,167 --> 00:55:59,158
Wash your face with the hot water.

548
00:55:59,247 --> 00:56:01,078
- Why?
- Your anger will cool down.

549
00:56:01,247 --> 00:56:03,317
- I won't.
- Then help me wash mine.

550
00:56:11,167 --> 00:56:12,680
Come, what are you doing there?

551
00:56:12,847 --> 00:56:14,678
You keep crying all day long.

552
00:56:15,247 --> 00:56:16,447
Who does the household chores?

553
00:56:19,007 --> 00:56:20,076
Come on.

554
00:56:21,767 --> 00:56:23,166
Come on. Come on.

555
00:56:33,687 --> 00:56:36,076
Hey.. hey, you're crying.

556
00:56:40,767 --> 00:56:44,157
Don't cry. I said don't cry.
Don't cry.

557
00:56:47,687 --> 00:56:49,245
Hey.. hey.

558
00:56:59,407 --> 00:57:04,322
Here. Here, more hot water.
Pour it on me.

559
00:57:05,647 --> 00:57:09,560
- Why?
- Why? Because you'll laugh at me again.

560
00:57:11,807 --> 00:57:16,198
- You're very nice, Khataralu.
- What did you say?

561
00:57:16,727 --> 00:57:19,560
Khataralu? You called me Khataralu?

562
00:57:20,487 --> 00:57:24,480
Enough. Enough. Now, I'm in heaven.

563
00:57:31,487 --> 00:57:34,638
I'll be your slave if you marry me.

564
00:57:37,047 --> 00:57:38,400
But I've one condition.

565
00:57:38,487 --> 00:57:40,463
Why one, one million,
you can keep 1,000 conditions..

566
00:57:40,487 --> 00:57:42,557
I will agree to it.

567
00:57:42,647 --> 00:57:44,399
You'll free the innocent princess..

568
00:57:44,487 --> 00:57:46,876
From that tortuous limp.

569
00:57:46,967 --> 00:57:49,561
That's all? It is very easy for me.

570
00:57:50,407 --> 00:57:55,276
But I need to think
of a very nice idea for that.

571
00:58:01,047 --> 00:58:04,198
Hey, why do you come uncalled?

572
00:58:04,287 --> 00:58:05,959
Can't you see
I'm thinking of an idea?

573
00:58:06,047 --> 00:58:07,400
Come on, go and do your work.

574
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:09,876
He has come here to trouble me..
Making sounds.

575
00:58:13,407 --> 00:58:16,205
What should I do?
What should I do, Salma?

576
00:58:16,807 --> 00:58:18,206
Idea?

577
00:58:22,407 --> 00:58:23,476
Idea..

578
00:58:24,407 --> 00:58:26,557
Wonderful. Wonderful. Wonderful.

579
00:58:26,647 --> 00:58:29,480
You've given me such a great idea.

580
00:58:30,727 --> 00:58:32,638
I got it. I understood the idea.

581
00:58:32,967 --> 00:58:35,640
But we'll need Zabak's help in this.

582
00:58:35,727 --> 00:58:38,639
Really? What say, Brother?
What do you think?

583
00:58:42,807 --> 00:58:45,719
Yes? Yes?
Look, Salma, he too agrees to it.

584
00:58:45,807 --> 00:58:49,117
Wonderful. Wonderful. What brains!

585
00:58:49,207 --> 00:58:51,482
Come, let me massage your feet.

586
00:58:58,487 --> 00:58:59,556
Who are you?

587
00:59:00,047 --> 00:59:03,403
- We stay on ground.
- And know about the sky.

588
00:59:03,487 --> 00:59:06,718
Ask. Ask. Ask about your future.

589
00:59:06,967 --> 00:59:08,958
- Will you be a king..
- Or a pauper.

590
00:59:09,207 --> 00:59:11,402
If you marry, when will you marry?

591
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:14,047
- Who will you marry?
- And how will you marry?

592
00:59:14,127 --> 00:59:17,199
- Oh, are you astrologers?
- Yes.

593
00:59:17,727 --> 00:59:19,638
Wait, I'll come right away.

594
00:59:21,647 --> 00:59:23,877
Hey, gloomy face, smile.

595
00:59:24,487 --> 00:59:28,480
I'm going to fix the wedding date.

596
00:59:36,207 --> 00:59:40,564
Hey dear, the pride of India,
Baluchistan..

597
00:59:40,647 --> 00:59:44,117
China and Japan. Be generous.

598
00:59:47,207 --> 00:59:50,404
"Tell me, my love, who are you?"

599
00:59:50,487 --> 00:59:51,556
"A fairy."

600
00:59:51,647 --> 00:59:53,126
"Tell me where have you come from?"

601
00:59:53,207 --> 00:59:54,799
"From the sky."

602
00:59:55,407 --> 00:59:58,399
- "Will you tell the feelings?
- I will."

603
00:59:58,487 --> 01:00:01,399
- "Will you show your magic?
- I will."

604
01:00:01,487 --> 01:00:04,718
"So, tell me what his destiny is?"

605
01:00:04,967 --> 01:00:07,197
"Wonderful. Wonderful."

606
01:00:07,287 --> 01:00:11,280
"The star of your destiny
is bright."

607
01:00:11,407 --> 01:00:15,400
- "The star of your destiny..
- Is bright."

608
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:19,196
"You'll get what you want."

609
01:00:19,287 --> 01:00:23,485
"The star of your destiny
is bright."

610
01:00:35,207 --> 01:00:37,038
"You've lost your heart."

611
01:00:37,127 --> 01:00:39,118
"What state is this?"

612
01:00:39,207 --> 01:00:41,038
"In someone's black tresses."

613
01:00:41,127 --> 01:00:43,561
"In someone's crooked walk."

614
01:00:47,207 --> 01:00:51,041
"Whom are you
dreaming about like crazy?"

615
01:00:51,127 --> 01:00:52,958
"What trap are you entrapped in?"

616
01:00:53,047 --> 01:00:55,117
"It is a big mess."

617
01:00:55,407 --> 01:00:59,400
"How did you come to know
that I'm in a bad state?"

618
01:00:59,487 --> 01:01:03,196
- "The star of your destiny..
- Is bright."

619
01:01:03,287 --> 01:01:07,200
"The star of your destiny
is bright."

620
01:01:07,287 --> 01:01:11,121
"You'll get what you want."

621
01:01:29,647 --> 01:01:33,720
"Look what my fate lines say."

622
01:01:33,807 --> 01:01:35,638
"What is my destiny?"

623
01:01:35,727 --> 01:01:38,400
"What should I do of my destiny?"

624
01:01:41,887 --> 01:01:45,721
"Your prey will be in your custody."

625
01:01:45,807 --> 01:01:47,638
"In the golden shackle."

626
01:01:47,727 --> 01:01:49,877
"That's written in your destiny."

627
01:01:49,967 --> 01:01:53,960
"Don't worry, dear.
It's a matter of a few days."

628
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:57,960
- "The star of your destiny..
- Is bright."

629
01:01:58,047 --> 01:02:01,960
"The star of your destiny
is bright."

630
01:02:02,127 --> 01:02:06,040
"You'll get what you want."

631
01:02:07,207 --> 01:02:08,276
Zainab.

632
01:02:14,727 --> 01:02:16,797
You? Why did you come here again?

633
01:02:17,287 --> 01:02:18,959
To repent for my sins.

634
01:02:19,207 --> 01:02:22,563
Go back. I don't even
want to see your face.

635
01:02:22,967 --> 01:02:25,197
I'll make sure
to hide my face next time.

636
01:02:25,727 --> 01:02:27,479
But for God's sake,
come with me now.

637
01:02:28,487 --> 01:02:30,478
I've made arrangements
to send you to Iswahaan.

638
01:02:31,407 --> 01:02:32,476
Iswahaan.

639
01:02:34,047 --> 01:02:36,117
There is no time to think,
Zainab. Hurry up.

640
01:02:36,967 --> 01:02:38,036
Okay.

641
01:02:42,127 --> 01:02:46,040
"When am I going to get married?"

642
01:02:46,127 --> 01:02:47,958
"When will she be mine?"

643
01:02:48,047 --> 01:02:50,402
"When will I get her?"

644
01:02:54,207 --> 01:02:58,041
"Apply this magical
kohl in your eyes."

645
01:02:58,127 --> 01:03:00,038
"You should remove
your moustaches too."

646
01:03:00,127 --> 01:03:02,197
"You should get rid
of your beard too."

647
01:03:02,287 --> 01:03:06,405
"Then watch our wonders."

648
01:03:06,487 --> 01:03:10,275
- "The star of your destiny..
- Is bright."

649
01:03:10,407 --> 01:03:14,195
"The star of your destiny
is bright."

650
01:03:14,287 --> 01:03:18,280
"You'll get what you want."

651
01:03:26,727 --> 01:03:28,718
"You'll get her. You'll get her."

652
01:03:28,887 --> 01:03:31,959
- "Will I get her?
- Surely, you'll get her."

653
01:03:32,727 --> 01:03:36,481
"The star of your destiny
is bright."

654
01:03:36,567 --> 01:03:39,798
"The star of your destiny
is bright."

655
01:03:39,967 --> 01:03:43,482
"You'll get what you want."

656
01:03:43,567 --> 01:03:45,398
"Wonderful."

657
01:03:50,727 --> 01:03:54,197
"The star of your destiny
is bright."

658
01:03:54,287 --> 01:03:57,802
"The star of your destiny
is bright."

659
01:03:57,887 --> 01:04:01,482
"You'll get what you want."

660
01:04:18,047 --> 01:04:20,481
I'm dead. I'm dead.

661
01:04:20,567 --> 01:04:23,718
- Red chilli powder.
- What chilli powder, Langardeen, pick him up.

662
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:25,383
I've something in my eyes.
Chilli powder.

663
01:04:25,407 --> 01:04:26,607
- Pick him up.
- Chilli powder.

664
01:04:26,647 --> 01:04:28,463
- You've thrown chilli powder in my eyes.
- Throw him.

665
01:04:28,487 --> 01:04:29,556
What are you doing?

666
01:04:30,487 --> 01:04:36,483
Mr. Langardeen, not yours,
now our destiny is bright.

667
01:04:36,807 --> 01:04:38,206
Let's go. Come on.

668
01:04:46,047 --> 01:04:47,116
Come on. Come on, hurry.

669
01:04:47,207 --> 01:04:48,799
There he is. Come on, come on.

670
01:04:48,887 --> 01:04:50,798
Both of you come down.
Come down. Hurry up.

671
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:54,038
- Don't worry, hurry up. Don't make noise.
- Make the arrangements.

672
01:04:54,127 --> 01:04:55,623
- Hurry up.
- Come, let's quickly make the arrangements.

673
01:04:55,647 --> 01:04:57,717
- Come.
- Yes, come. Come, come.

674
01:04:57,807 --> 01:05:00,640
Come on. Come on.

675
01:05:00,727 --> 01:05:03,195
- Come on. Come on. Hurry. Hurry. Yes.
- Hurry. Hurry.

676
01:05:03,287 --> 01:05:04,402
Change your clothes fast.

677
01:05:16,367 --> 01:05:18,756
Trust me, he is still decent.

678
01:05:19,447 --> 01:05:22,917
Oh, so, Zabak was forced
to become a dacoit.

679
01:05:23,007 --> 01:05:26,443
Yes. He has endured enough
punishment for his mistakes.

680
01:05:37,207 --> 01:05:39,277
So, I misunderstood him.

681
01:05:50,207 --> 01:05:52,767
Zabak, listen.. What?

682
01:05:54,767 --> 01:05:56,678
Salma. Hey. Where are you taking me?

683
01:05:56,847 --> 01:05:57,916
What's wrong with you?

684
01:05:58,007 --> 01:06:00,521
You're strange. Leave me, Salma.

685
01:06:00,607 --> 01:06:02,263
Hey, what are you doing?
What are you doing?

686
01:06:02,287 --> 01:06:04,084
- Oh, gosh.
- God help us.

687
01:06:04,207 --> 01:06:08,280
- Oh, gosh.
- Can't you see? You purposely bumped into me.

688
01:06:08,607 --> 01:06:11,838
No, I didn't.
Khataralu did it intentionally.

689
01:06:12,447 --> 01:06:15,007
I'm not at fault,
but would still like to apologise.

690
01:06:15,767 --> 01:06:16,836
Apologise.

691
01:06:19,607 --> 01:06:22,280
- But you too..
- You too what?

692
01:06:22,767 --> 01:06:24,837
I mean you too bumped into me.

693
01:06:25,007 --> 01:06:28,602
Why would I? Salma did this.

694
01:06:29,367 --> 01:06:30,436
Salma?

695
01:06:31,527 --> 01:06:32,927
Why? Why did Salma have to do that?

696
01:06:33,207 --> 01:06:35,357
- Yes, tell me.
- Okay, wait.

697
01:06:35,447 --> 01:06:36,516
I'll go and ask Salma.

698
01:06:37,007 --> 01:06:39,919
- Don't go to her.
- Okay, then I'll ask Khataralu.

699
01:06:40,687 --> 01:06:41,756
You're so naTTve.

700
01:06:42,207 --> 01:06:45,916
Don't you understand
they did it intentionally?

701
01:06:46,687 --> 01:06:50,202
Intentionally. May I ask why?

702
01:06:58,007 --> 01:07:01,920
You need not worry. I'll take you
to Iswahaan as promised.

703
01:07:02,447 --> 01:07:05,996
- Don't worry.
- But.. but Zabak. Zabak..

704
01:07:08,007 --> 01:07:10,840
- Salma has told me the truth.
- What truth?

705
01:07:12,007 --> 01:07:17,206
- Don't make me feel ashamed. I misunderstood you.
- But..

706
01:07:17,447 --> 01:07:21,440
No buts. Now, I know you.

707
01:07:27,287 --> 01:07:31,519
"I know you.
Whether you believe it or not."

708
01:07:31,607 --> 01:07:35,759
"That's generous of you, my beloved."

709
01:07:35,847 --> 01:07:39,920
"I know you.
Whether you believe it or not."

710
01:07:40,007 --> 01:07:44,285
"That's generous of you, my beloved."

711
01:07:57,007 --> 01:07:59,202
"Walk careful."

712
01:07:59,287 --> 01:08:05,362
"Look, it's not good to bump
into anyone in the way."

713
01:08:09,607 --> 01:08:11,837
"Walk carefully."

714
01:08:11,927 --> 01:08:18,275
"Look, it's not good to bump
into anyone in the way."

715
01:08:18,367 --> 01:08:22,201
"How would you fall?"

716
01:08:22,527 --> 01:08:26,361
"You need excuses
to meet beautiful girls."

717
01:08:26,846 --> 01:08:30,919
"This was a nice opportunity,
I know it."

718
01:08:31,006 --> 01:08:35,363
"I know you.
Whether you believe it or not."

719
01:08:35,447 --> 01:08:39,440
"That's generous of you,
my beloved."

720
01:08:51,926 --> 01:08:56,204
"I'm all yours."

721
01:08:56,287 --> 01:09:00,360
"Whether you believe it or not,
it depends on you."

722
01:09:04,687 --> 01:09:08,760
"I'm all yours."

723
01:09:08,926 --> 01:09:13,204
"Whether you believe it or not,
it depends on you."

724
01:09:13,287 --> 01:09:21,285
"All the desires in your
heart are now my desires."

725
01:09:21,607 --> 01:09:25,759
"I bestow my heart
and my life to you, my beloved."

726
01:09:25,926 --> 01:09:29,999
"I know you.
Whether you believe it or not."

727
01:09:30,087 --> 01:09:34,205
"That's generous of you,
my beloved."

728
01:09:34,287 --> 01:09:38,360
"I know you.
Whether you believe it or not."

729
01:09:38,447 --> 01:09:42,520
"That's generous of you,
my beloved."

730
01:10:03,287 --> 01:10:06,836
- Oh, God. They are all my beloveds.
- What did you say?

731
01:10:06,927 --> 01:10:07,996
You shout a lot.

732
01:10:08,087 --> 01:10:09,918
They are Samina's women army.

733
01:10:10,007 --> 01:10:12,441
- Stop your nonsense.
- Oh, God, I'm scared.

734
01:10:12,847 --> 01:10:14,997
Take them all to the princess.

735
01:10:36,367 --> 01:10:37,767
You too turned out to be a traitor.

736
01:10:39,007 --> 01:10:40,918
You helped an enemy's daughter flee.

737
01:10:46,847 --> 01:10:49,441
Tomorrow, you all will
be presented to father.

738
01:10:49,767 --> 01:10:51,758
And your crimes will be
decided upon in the court.

739
01:11:04,767 --> 01:11:09,079
Samina. Samina,
I saved your honour once.

740
01:11:09,527 --> 01:11:11,279
You can save our honour today.

741
01:11:14,847 --> 01:11:19,204
Nothing will happen
to you, just Zainab.

742
01:11:20,767 --> 01:11:23,281
And I'm pleading to you for Zainab.

743
01:11:25,007 --> 01:11:31,003
You need someone else,
and I need you.

744
01:11:33,527 --> 01:11:35,199
No, Samina.
I wish to wash off my sins..

745
01:11:35,287 --> 01:11:38,085
By sending Zainab to Iswahaan.

746
01:11:40,207 --> 01:11:42,004
Support me just once.

747
01:11:43,527 --> 01:11:46,519
What will I get in place of that?

748
01:11:47,927 --> 01:11:51,761
- I've nothing with me.
- You have a lot.

749
01:11:53,007 --> 01:11:55,919
- A lot? Then ask for it.
- Really?

750
01:11:56,447 --> 01:12:00,599
- Try me.
- Zainab can be free..

751
01:12:01,927 --> 01:12:04,282
If you agree to stay back here.

752
01:12:04,687 --> 01:12:08,202
I agree. But..

753
01:12:09,447 --> 01:12:12,519
She shouldn't know
this secret or else..

754
01:12:12,767 --> 01:12:13,995
What will happen otherwise?

755
01:12:14,087 --> 01:12:15,647
She won't go to Iswahaan
all by herself.

756
01:12:15,847 --> 01:12:16,996
I agree.

757
01:12:31,767 --> 01:12:34,201
Zainab, Samina has agreed to us.

758
01:12:34,287 --> 01:12:35,845
She has freed all of us.

759
01:12:36,207 --> 01:12:38,357
But I'll have to stay here
for sometime.

760
01:12:38,847 --> 01:12:41,998
Khataralu, you and Salma
take Zainab to garden of Zeal.

761
01:12:42,767 --> 01:12:45,281
- But when will you come?
- He'll come.

762
01:12:46,927 --> 01:12:51,762
I'm making him stay back so
that father's fears are assuaged.

763
01:12:54,607 --> 01:12:57,679
Samina, you've fulfilled my desire.

764
01:12:59,927 --> 01:13:01,997
God will fulfil your desire too.

765
01:13:07,447 --> 01:13:10,359
Brother Zabak, come soon. Goodbye.

766
01:13:48,087 --> 01:13:53,002
"What kind of intoxication
of love is this?"

767
01:13:57,007 --> 01:14:01,444
"I've started enjoying
this feeling a little."

768
01:14:05,607 --> 01:14:09,919
"What kind of intoxication
of love is this?"

769
01:14:10,007 --> 01:14:14,444
"I've started enjoying
this feeling a little."

770
01:14:27,527 --> 01:14:31,600
"When the hearts united,
the flowers bloomed."

771
01:14:31,927 --> 01:14:36,205
"I got to know new secrets."

772
01:14:40,687 --> 01:14:44,600
"When the hearts united,
the flowers bloomed."

773
01:14:45,087 --> 01:14:48,921
"I got to know new secrets."

774
01:14:49,447 --> 01:14:57,447
"I swear by you, my love,
I learnt new ways of life."

775
01:14:57,607 --> 01:15:01,919
"I lost my heart to your charms."

776
01:15:02,007 --> 01:15:03,998
"I had no control over it."

777
01:15:04,527 --> 01:15:09,282
"What kind of intoxication
of love is this?"

778
01:15:13,287 --> 01:15:17,758
"What kind of intoxication
of love is this?"

779
01:15:17,847 --> 01:15:22,204
"I've started enjoying
this feeling a little."

780
01:15:35,087 --> 01:15:36,998
"My heart is naTTve."

781
01:15:37,087 --> 01:15:39,282
"This night is beautiful."

782
01:15:39,367 --> 01:15:43,360
"This is a wonderful
moment of our lives."

783
01:15:48,007 --> 01:15:49,918
"My heart is naTTve."

784
01:15:50,207 --> 01:15:51,845
"This night is beautiful."

785
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:56,360
"This is a wonderful
moment of our lives."

786
01:15:56,927 --> 01:16:00,840
"How will the emotions
be controlled?"

787
01:16:01,087 --> 01:16:04,841
"This is the trouble we've to face."

788
01:16:04,927 --> 01:16:09,205
"I got pain which has no cure,
other than your love."

789
01:16:12,087 --> 01:16:16,205
"What kind of intoxication
of love is this?"

790
01:16:20,527 --> 01:16:24,759
"What kind of intoxication
of love is this?"

791
01:16:24,847 --> 01:16:29,363
"I've started enjoying
this feeling a little."

792
01:16:40,287 --> 01:16:41,356
Wonderful.

793
01:16:41,447 --> 01:16:44,996
- What a beautiful sight!
- And the water is so clean too.

794
01:16:45,087 --> 01:16:48,682
- I feel like taking a dip into it.
- Do you wish to drown?

795
01:16:48,767 --> 01:16:52,203
Yes. Yes. No, no.
Now, I can't go anywhere without you.

796
01:16:52,287 --> 01:16:55,199
Now, if God wants
to send me to hell..

797
01:16:55,287 --> 01:16:58,518
I will ask Him to send
my Salma with me.

798
01:16:58,607 --> 01:17:00,598
So, you want to send me to hell?

799
01:17:00,687 --> 01:17:02,687
- Yes, but we'll go together, no problem.
- Really?

800
01:17:03,287 --> 01:17:05,437
What is this? What is this?
What is this?

801
01:17:05,527 --> 01:17:07,367
You're going to hit me.
You're going to hit me.

802
01:17:07,447 --> 01:17:10,837
You're going to hit me.
Save me. Save me.

803
01:17:51,287 --> 01:17:53,278
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, gosh.

804
01:18:44,767 --> 01:18:48,840
Thank God that
I reached here on time.

805
01:18:49,007 --> 01:18:54,206
- Thank you.
- It is my pleasure to be of use to you.

806
01:18:57,607 --> 01:19:00,997
May I know who are you?

807
01:19:01,087 --> 01:19:05,205
I am king of
Iswahaan's daughter Zainab.

808
01:19:05,927 --> 01:19:09,203
But I'm surprised that
which heartless person..

809
01:19:09,287 --> 01:19:12,279
Threw the beauty of
the palace into a jungle.

810
01:19:22,527 --> 01:19:26,679
Help. Help. Salma, save me.

811
01:19:26,767 --> 01:19:29,679
- Who?
- There. Where? Where?

812
01:19:32,287 --> 01:19:33,686
You've come at the right time.

813
01:19:33,767 --> 01:19:35,280
Arrest this ill-mannered person.

814
01:19:37,007 --> 01:19:38,201
Well-done.

815
01:19:47,007 --> 01:19:51,205
Prince, order me. I'll behead this
ill-mannered girl immediately.

816
01:19:55,447 --> 01:19:58,678
- He is Prince of Yemen.
- Then we're doomed.

817
01:20:05,007 --> 01:20:09,683
This beautiful face is worthy
to be stored in the heart.

818
01:20:10,847 --> 01:20:12,280
Take her to the royal palace.

819
01:20:13,007 --> 01:20:14,727
- Sir, take us along.
- And Prince, should..

820
01:20:14,767 --> 01:20:16,758
We take them along too?

821
01:20:17,607 --> 01:20:20,758
I'm interested in the flower
and not the thorns.

822
01:20:22,087 --> 01:20:23,202
Hey.

823
01:20:23,287 --> 01:20:25,357
Hey, what are you doing?
What are you doing?

824
01:20:25,447 --> 01:20:27,287
- Don't you have manners?
- What are you doing?

825
01:20:32,287 --> 01:20:35,199
You wanted to get wet,
right? Do that now.

826
01:20:38,287 --> 01:20:39,423
- Now.. What will happen now?
- Now?

827
01:20:39,447 --> 01:20:41,199
Prince of Yemen took Zainab away.

828
01:20:41,287 --> 01:20:44,006
- What will happen now?
- Now, you too take me away.

829
01:20:44,087 --> 01:20:46,760
- What?
- Yes. What did you say? You stupid.

830
01:20:51,807 --> 01:20:54,162
So, that clever girl
ran away from your house?

831
01:20:54,887 --> 01:20:57,082
And you didn't do anything about it?

832
01:20:57,647 --> 01:21:02,084
Chief, if that person wouldn't
have thrown chilli powder..

833
01:21:02,167 --> 01:21:06,399
In my eyes then I would have
showed him my muscle power.

834
01:21:07,087 --> 01:21:08,236
That's bang on target.

835
01:21:09,567 --> 01:21:11,080
But where's Khataralu?

836
01:21:11,567 --> 01:21:14,081
Father, as soon as
I heard that Zainab ran away..

837
01:21:14,167 --> 01:21:17,079
I immediately sent Khataralu..

838
01:21:17,167 --> 01:21:19,237
And Salma to search for her.

839
01:21:19,647 --> 01:21:23,083
Well-done.
This is called a woman's thinking.

840
01:21:25,167 --> 01:21:29,319
Zabak. I want to give you
a special responsibility.

841
01:21:29,407 --> 01:21:30,476
Tell me.

842
01:21:31,567 --> 01:21:35,242
After Iswahaan,
we'll loot Yemen now.

843
01:21:35,327 --> 01:21:37,795
- Yemen. Long live..
- The chief.

844
01:21:39,167 --> 01:21:41,078
You should make arrangements..

845
01:21:41,167 --> 01:21:43,476
To go there
in disguise immediately.

846
01:21:44,967 --> 01:21:49,563
I'll make you the head of the tribe
if you're successful.

847
01:21:50,327 --> 01:21:53,797
And I'll give you my
most priced possession.

848
01:21:55,087 --> 01:21:59,717
- Most priced possession?
- Yes. My daughter.

849
01:22:03,247 --> 01:22:06,717
And what if
I don't help you in this?

850
01:22:07,167 --> 01:22:08,395
Bang on target again.

851
01:22:09,167 --> 01:22:15,402
Zabak, a tiger always hunts.
And a dacoit always loots.

852
01:22:16,807 --> 01:22:19,082
Everyone loves what they do.

853
01:22:19,647 --> 01:22:21,717
It's a human's duty to be honest.

854
01:22:22,487 --> 01:22:25,638
I love honesty and no one else.

855
01:22:26,967 --> 01:22:28,559
The one who doesn't follow Usman..

856
01:22:28,647 --> 01:22:30,080
Aaga's order loses his life.

857
01:22:35,967 --> 01:22:40,245
I'm already dead.
Now, I wait for salvation.

858
01:22:41,887 --> 01:22:43,320
Arrest this rebel.

859
01:23:46,887 --> 01:23:48,081
Father.

860
01:23:49,567 --> 01:23:51,558
- Chief.
- Leave. Leave me.

861
01:23:51,967 --> 01:23:54,083
Oh, God! My leg.

862
01:23:54,407 --> 01:23:55,886
What happened, Father?

863
01:23:56,247 --> 01:23:57,316
I've injured my leg.

864
01:24:15,807 --> 01:24:18,082
A prey escapes a tiger's clutches..

865
01:24:18,167 --> 01:24:21,079
And he won't do anything about it?
This is impossible.

866
01:24:22,087 --> 01:24:23,566
And I go and get him arrested.

867
01:24:23,647 --> 01:24:25,543
- Chief. Chief.
- Don't go, chief. Chief. Don't go.

868
01:24:25,567 --> 01:24:29,082
Chief, the wound is deep.
Your leg might become useless.

869
01:24:29,167 --> 01:24:31,303
What about the reputation of
mine that he has maligned?

870
01:24:31,327 --> 01:24:35,161
Father, I'm your daughter after all.

871
01:24:35,887 --> 01:24:38,720
Zabak has not only insulted you,
but me too.

872
01:24:38,887 --> 01:24:42,402
I'll seek revenge from him.
Allow me to go to Yemen.

873
01:24:42,887 --> 01:24:46,084
Well-done, dear.

874
01:24:55,567 --> 01:24:57,637
That's Zabak. That's my horse.

875
01:25:06,647 --> 01:25:08,160
- Zabak.
- Here I'm, Khataralu.

876
01:25:08,247 --> 01:25:11,557
- Where's Zainab?
- Zainab. Where is Zainab?

877
01:25:11,647 --> 01:25:13,160
Why? Where's Zainab?

878
01:25:14,807 --> 01:25:19,164
A pity. Prince of Yemen has
taken her to the royal palace.

879
01:25:19,887 --> 01:25:21,400
Prince of Yemen took her away?

880
01:25:23,647 --> 01:25:26,878
Oh, God, what kind of
tests are you taking?

881
01:25:28,327 --> 01:25:30,557
Do you want me to become
the royal traitor too?

882
01:25:45,647 --> 01:25:51,563
Wonderful.
I'm pleased with your choice, Parvez.

883
01:25:52,567 --> 01:25:57,482
Today, I know that
Mahmood Shah Suhani's palace..

884
01:25:57,567 --> 01:26:02,800
Had such a light that
could put a moon to shame.

885
01:26:03,487 --> 01:26:08,322
Your Highness, this light
wishes to extinguish now.

886
01:26:09,647 --> 01:26:12,400
Oh, no, what are you saying?

887
01:26:13,567 --> 01:26:17,242
Your Highness, please give me death.

888
01:26:17,487 --> 01:26:22,163
Oh, no. Oh, no.
I believe Parvez has misbehaved.

889
01:26:23,247 --> 01:26:27,081
If it is a mistake to bring
Zainab to the royal palace..

890
01:26:27,167 --> 01:26:30,398
From the garden of Zeal
then I'm guilty, Father.

891
01:26:30,807 --> 01:26:35,642
It is not your fault, Parvez.
It is of Zainab's beauty.

892
01:26:38,327 --> 01:26:41,080
I give you a chance
to think over it.

893
01:26:41,567 --> 01:26:45,560
But remember emperors'
decisions don't change.

894
01:26:45,647 --> 01:26:47,080
But Your Highness, even what is..

895
01:26:47,167 --> 01:26:49,476
Once decided by the heart,
doesn't change.

896
01:26:49,567 --> 01:26:52,081
Wonderful. Well said.

897
01:26:52,807 --> 01:26:56,083
But time changes the decision made
by the heart.

898
01:26:56,647 --> 01:27:02,563
Maids, make Zainab stay in our
special guest house with honour.

899
01:27:02,807 --> 01:27:04,559
And all her wishes
should be fulfilled.

900
01:27:07,407 --> 01:27:11,400
Keep in mind, till Zainab
doesn't give her consent..

901
01:27:11,487 --> 01:27:15,719
Parvez cannot enter that palace.

902
01:27:25,807 --> 01:27:28,082
It must have been
an auspicious hour..

903
01:27:28,167 --> 01:27:30,158
That His Highness give
in to Prince's request.

904
01:27:30,247 --> 01:27:34,160
And agreed for the alliance.
Now, you'll be our queen.

905
01:27:38,967 --> 01:27:40,082
But..

906
01:27:40,167 --> 01:27:43,876
So, don't you love the young
and handsome prince?

907
01:27:46,407 --> 01:27:50,082
No. Someone else rules my heart.

908
01:28:10,967 --> 01:28:14,721
- Who is that lucky one?
- Where is he?

909
01:28:19,727 --> 01:28:25,723
Far away,
but his image lies in my eyes.

910
01:28:29,807 --> 01:28:31,718
Thank God we're safe.

911
01:28:31,807 --> 01:28:33,407
We've at least reached
the royal gardens.

912
01:28:33,487 --> 01:28:35,079
But how will
we enter the palace now?

913
01:28:35,407 --> 01:28:37,557
The one who has to go will go,
why should we go?

914
01:28:38,407 --> 01:28:39,476
What say, Bahadur?

915
01:28:39,807 --> 01:28:42,082
You stay here.
I'll go and meet Zainab.

916
01:28:49,094 --> 01:28:57,012
"May you be blessed
with the old memories."

917
01:28:57,854 --> 01:29:04,771
"May you be blessed
with the new beginning."

918
01:29:05,854 --> 01:29:13,408
"Don't miss me if it's possible."

919
01:29:13,934 --> 01:29:21,773
"Even if you miss me, forget me."

920
01:29:22,694 --> 01:29:27,609
"The riches of royal palaces.."

921
01:29:28,374 --> 01:29:32,686
"Have snatched my childhood love."

922
01:29:33,254 --> 01:29:37,088
"My childhood love."

923
01:29:37,694 --> 01:29:42,609
"Don't blame me, my love.."

924
01:29:42,694 --> 01:29:47,848
"I beg you to trust me."

925
01:29:47,934 --> 01:29:51,927
"I beg you to trust me."

926
01:30:07,694 --> 01:30:10,003
"You're high up there,
beyond my reach.."

927
01:30:10,094 --> 01:30:12,403
". .And I lie deep down in oblivion."

928
01:30:12,494 --> 01:30:16,612
"How can you know my agony?"

929
01:30:22,174 --> 01:30:24,608
"You're high up there,
beyond my reach.."

930
01:30:24,694 --> 01:30:26,924
". .And I lie deep down in oblivion."

931
01:30:27,014 --> 01:30:31,087
"How can you know my agony?"

932
01:30:32,014 --> 01:30:34,608
"Even if you don't believe.."

933
01:30:34,694 --> 01:30:37,606
"I am yours and only yours.."

934
01:30:37,694 --> 01:30:40,413
". .Even though I reside
among the rich."

935
01:30:40,934 --> 01:30:45,610
"Don't blame me, my love.."

936
01:30:45,694 --> 01:30:50,848
"I beg you to trust me."

937
01:30:50,934 --> 01:30:54,847
"I beg you to trust me."

938
01:31:05,854 --> 01:31:10,848
"I want you to take me with you."

939
01:31:10,934 --> 01:31:14,847
"My heart requests you this."

940
01:31:15,774 --> 01:31:20,609
"I want you to take me with you."

941
01:31:20,694 --> 01:31:24,323
"My heart requests you this."

942
01:31:25,414 --> 01:31:29,612
"Your life is different than mine.."

943
01:31:29,694 --> 01:31:34,165
". .And mine is different than yours."

944
01:31:34,494 --> 01:31:39,090
"The riches of royal palaces.."

945
01:31:39,174 --> 01:31:44,612
"Have snatched my childhood love."

946
01:31:44,774 --> 01:31:48,608
"My childhood love."

947
01:32:04,414 --> 01:32:08,612
"I don't want to be a hurdle.."

948
01:32:08,694 --> 01:32:13,165
". .And an unfinished dream for you."

949
01:32:13,934 --> 01:32:18,610
"I don't want to be a hurdle.."

950
01:32:18,694 --> 01:32:22,687
". .And an unfinished dream for you."

951
01:32:23,774 --> 01:32:27,926
"You would always reside
as my object.."

952
01:32:28,014 --> 01:32:32,246
". .Of love and admiration."

953
01:32:32,614 --> 01:32:37,608
"Don't blame me, my love.."

954
01:32:37,694 --> 01:32:42,609
"I beg you to trust me."

955
01:32:42,694 --> 01:32:46,164
"I beg you to trust me."

956
01:32:47,174 --> 01:32:51,611
"The riches of royal palaces.."

957
01:32:51,694 --> 01:32:56,768
"Have snatched my childhood love."

958
01:32:57,174 --> 01:33:01,406
"My childhood love."

959
01:33:06,614 --> 01:33:07,683
Zabak.

960
01:33:08,174 --> 01:33:10,165
I knew that you'll come for sure.

961
01:33:11,774 --> 01:33:13,093
But why do you look sad..

962
01:33:13,174 --> 01:33:14,607
Instead of being happy?

963
01:33:16,254 --> 01:33:17,403
What happened to you?

964
01:33:18,174 --> 01:33:20,688
Why are you so gloomy
in such a beautiful night, Zabak?

965
01:33:23,334 --> 01:33:24,403
Zainab.

966
01:33:26,414 --> 01:33:29,167
This beautiful night is once
again playing with my fate.

967
01:33:30,174 --> 01:33:31,243
I've..

968
01:33:31,934 --> 01:33:33,974
I've come here to bid you goodbye
for the last time.

969
01:33:36,694 --> 01:33:37,763
How can you say that?

970
01:33:39,094 --> 01:33:41,608
I'm here to sacrifice
my heart at the feet..

971
01:33:41,694 --> 01:33:44,606
Of the would-be Queen of Yemen.

972
01:33:44,694 --> 01:33:46,332
No, no. Don't say that.

973
01:33:47,174 --> 01:33:50,689
I wish to remain in your heart
and that's my bliss.

974
01:33:51,254 --> 01:33:53,609
I am just yours, Zabak. Just yours.

975
01:33:53,694 --> 01:33:55,844
You seem to forget
that I am a dacoit.

976
01:33:57,014 --> 01:33:58,766
You own my fate.

977
01:33:59,094 --> 01:34:00,322
I am a traitor.

978
01:34:01,694 --> 01:34:04,254
You've paid for your sins.

979
01:34:04,934 --> 01:34:06,333
I am not a prince.

980
01:34:07,254 --> 01:34:09,404
But you're an honest man.

981
01:34:09,774 --> 01:34:10,843
Zainab.

982
01:34:11,254 --> 01:34:14,007
Zabak, now, I come in your refuge.

983
01:34:14,854 --> 01:34:16,606
I beg of you.

984
01:34:17,174 --> 01:34:18,607
Take me away from here, Zabak.

985
01:34:18,694 --> 01:34:19,763
Take me away from here.

986
01:34:22,614 --> 01:34:26,402
Oh, God. You're my saviour.

987
01:34:27,494 --> 01:34:29,689
Please don't let me commit this sin.

988
01:34:31,254 --> 01:34:36,328
Zabak, true love always leads you
to the right path.

989
01:34:37,774 --> 01:34:43,849
Zainab, merciful emperor
is the protector of justice.

990
01:34:45,174 --> 01:34:49,167
He wishes you to marry his son
and be a queen.

991
01:34:49,774 --> 01:34:52,686
No, no. I can't marry you.

992
01:34:52,774 --> 01:34:54,605
- Zabak.
- It's not possible.

993
01:34:55,614 --> 01:34:57,923
I've got my countrymen's blood
on my hands.

994
01:34:58,614 --> 01:35:00,411
I cannot touch you with these hands.

995
01:35:01,014 --> 01:35:03,084
- I can't do it, Zainab.
- Zabak.

996
01:35:03,174 --> 01:35:04,243
Forgive me.

997
01:35:04,334 --> 01:35:05,454
- Forget me, Zainab.
- Zabak.

998
01:35:05,494 --> 01:35:07,610
Listen to me, Zabak. Zabak.

999
01:36:09,854 --> 01:36:10,923
You?

1000
01:36:12,214 --> 01:36:13,283
Why have you come here?

1001
01:36:14,374 --> 01:36:16,365
His Excellency has forbidden you,
didn't he?

1002
01:36:18,454 --> 01:36:23,289
I tried my best to obey my father.

1003
01:36:25,694 --> 01:36:30,131
I tried to drown
the pain of my separation..

1004
01:36:30,214 --> 01:36:34,127
In this goblet of spirit.

1005
01:36:39,454 --> 01:36:45,450
But the more I drink,
the more I miss you.

1006
01:36:49,854 --> 01:36:51,606
If you want to protect your honour..

1007
01:36:51,694 --> 01:36:53,685
Then leave this place at once.

1008
01:36:58,294 --> 01:37:01,286
You look lovely when you're angry.

1009
01:37:23,694 --> 01:37:24,830
- What happened?
- What happened?

1010
01:37:24,854 --> 01:37:26,134
- What happened?
- What happened?

1011
01:37:27,294 --> 01:37:28,852
Prince. You're here?

1012
01:37:48,974 --> 01:37:50,885
Attention. Attention.

1013
01:37:51,254 --> 01:37:53,085
Royal court members,
be on your feet.

1014
01:37:53,654 --> 01:37:54,723
Behave properly.

1015
01:37:55,414 --> 01:37:56,563
Observe silence.

1016
01:37:59,174 --> 01:38:00,653
Bow down and pay respect.

1017
01:38:00,894 --> 01:38:02,088
Look down.

1018
01:38:02,414 --> 01:38:05,087
The King of state.
The merciful one.

1019
01:38:05,494 --> 01:38:09,567
The protector.
Sultan of Yemen has arrived.

1020
01:38:19,134 --> 01:38:21,443
Let today's proceedings begin.

1021
01:38:24,134 --> 01:38:25,886
Zainab. Daughter of King Mahmood..

1022
01:38:25,974 --> 01:38:28,693
The King of Iswahaan.

1023
01:38:32,734 --> 01:38:36,204
Zainab, you must have
thought about the decision.

1024
01:38:36,494 --> 01:38:37,563
Yes, Your Excellency.

1025
01:38:37,814 --> 01:38:40,487
So, shall we declare
the wedding announcement..

1026
01:38:40,574 --> 01:38:41,894
With Prince Parvez right away?

1027
01:38:43,694 --> 01:38:45,685
His Excellency is free
to do anything he wants.

1028
01:38:46,454 --> 01:38:48,350
But I always thought that
an Emperor's happiness..

1029
01:38:48,374 --> 01:38:51,172
Lies in his subjects happiness.

1030
01:38:51,294 --> 01:38:55,685
His Excellency wants to make you
his daughter-in-law.

1031
01:38:56,294 --> 01:38:58,364
But you in turn want to accuse him?

1032
01:38:58,454 --> 01:39:02,003
Ignorant girl.
You're refusing wealth and power.

1033
01:39:02,454 --> 01:39:03,523
But why?

1034
01:39:04,454 --> 01:39:07,287
Your Excellency,
the happiness of heart..

1035
01:39:07,374 --> 01:39:10,525
Is far more important
than riches and titles.

1036
01:39:10,774 --> 01:39:13,288
But an Emperor must
think about his son's..

1037
01:39:13,374 --> 01:39:16,605
Happiness as well as
the happiness of his subjects.

1038
01:39:16,694 --> 01:39:19,003
An emperor is like
a father to his subjects.

1039
01:39:19,454 --> 01:39:24,005
And he has no right to sacrifice
their happiness for his son.

1040
01:39:24,094 --> 01:39:27,006
Girl, you're disrespecting
the emperor.

1041
01:39:37,694 --> 01:39:41,846
Zainab, you've stopped me
from treading the wrong path.

1042
01:39:43,294 --> 01:39:46,286
The emperor had forgotten
about his duties..

1043
01:39:46,374 --> 01:39:48,683
As he was more worried
about his son.

1044
01:39:53,094 --> 01:39:57,292
Dear, I won't force you
to be my daughter-in-law.

1045
01:39:57,934 --> 01:40:00,289
But Father.
My decision is irreversible.

1046
01:40:00,854 --> 01:40:03,288
So that history won't
condemn me for..

1047
01:40:03,374 --> 01:40:07,606
Being selfish and sacrificing
a helpless subject.

1048
01:40:08,934 --> 01:40:11,448
The supreme ruler. Hail to him.

1049
01:40:11,534 --> 01:40:13,604
The supreme ruler. Hail to him.

1050
01:40:14,294 --> 01:40:16,091
Continue with the proceeding.

1051
01:40:16,854 --> 01:40:21,291
The commander of
Iswahaan Kasim Baig wishes to..

1052
01:40:21,374 --> 01:40:25,845
See His Excellency
and seeks his permission.

1053
01:40:26,294 --> 01:40:27,522
Permission granted.

1054
01:40:27,934 --> 01:40:29,526
Protector of state.

1055
01:40:30,934 --> 01:40:32,447
Commander of armies.

1056
01:40:33,294 --> 01:40:35,524
Mirza Kasim Baig.

1057
01:40:44,294 --> 01:40:47,684
The humble servant presents himself
in front of the emperor.

1058
01:40:48,294 --> 01:40:52,606
Tell me, Kasim.
How are the people of Iswahaan doing?

1059
01:40:53,094 --> 01:40:55,289
Your Excellency,
this humble servant wants to..

1060
01:40:55,374 --> 01:40:58,605
Tell you the hardships
that our people are facing.

1061
01:40:59,694 --> 01:41:02,288
When I was getting married
to Zainab, the daughter..

1062
01:41:02,374 --> 01:41:05,286
Of our beloved King,
that same night..

1063
01:41:05,374 --> 01:41:09,003
The dacoits attacked us suddenly.

1064
01:41:09,294 --> 01:41:10,522
How dare they?

1065
01:41:11,094 --> 01:41:12,846
How could they
disrespect King of Yemen?

1066
01:41:12,934 --> 01:41:15,289
Iswahaan was robbed
and its womenfolk..

1067
01:41:15,374 --> 01:41:18,286
Were rendered widows
and its helpless..

1068
01:41:18,374 --> 01:41:21,286
Children were subjected
to brutality.

1069
01:41:22,094 --> 01:41:25,450
It was sad that they
abducted my fiancee.

1070
01:41:25,614 --> 01:41:31,007
Kasim Baig, your fiancee is present
in the royal court at this moment.

1071
01:41:36,694 --> 01:41:37,922
God is merciful.

1072
01:41:38,454 --> 01:41:41,287
Chief minister,
please call back our armies..

1073
01:41:41,374 --> 01:41:45,003
From the border
to protect Iswahaan.

1074
01:41:46,774 --> 01:41:53,612
Kasim Baig, you can return
to Iswahaan after the army returns.

1075
01:41:55,374 --> 01:41:58,286
And tell King Mahmood
that emperor himself..

1076
01:41:58,374 --> 01:42:00,444
Would be present
at Zainab's wedding.

1077
01:42:00,614 --> 01:42:04,448
- But Father..
- Keep quiet. This is a royal summon.

1078
01:42:04,774 --> 01:42:08,289
Your Excellency,
I can't seem to bespeak as..

1079
01:42:08,374 --> 01:42:10,524
I tell you this dreadful news.

1080
01:42:14,094 --> 01:42:18,292
On the same wretched night,
our beloved King Mahmood..

1081
01:42:18,374 --> 01:42:22,765
Was murdered
at the hands of the dacoits.

1082
01:42:36,174 --> 01:42:38,165
It's quite true that
our sire is very lucky.

1083
01:42:38,454 --> 01:42:42,367
No, my friend. It's his intelligence
that has done the trick.

1084
01:42:47,854 --> 01:42:53,326
Now, I'm waiting for the day
when I'll make Zainab mine.

1085
01:42:56,614 --> 01:42:59,174
Before that, you'll have to
face the fury of my sword.

1086
01:43:03,294 --> 01:43:08,368
How lucky I am. That I'll be
facing the prince himself.

1087
01:43:16,374 --> 01:43:18,968
We'll decide the fate
our love ourselves.

1088
01:43:19,214 --> 01:43:22,809
Just remember,
the emperor must not know about this.

1089
01:43:23,734 --> 01:43:25,213
- I agree.
- So, it's decided.

1090
01:43:26,214 --> 01:43:27,550
Tomorrow, at the first rays
of the sun..

1091
01:43:27,574 --> 01:43:29,724
We'll meet at the top
of the black mountain.

1092
01:43:29,974 --> 01:43:31,043
God willing, we will.

1093
01:43:39,294 --> 01:43:41,967
Come on, move. Move I say, Salma.

1094
01:43:42,054 --> 01:43:43,190
- Just come with me.
- No, no.

1095
01:43:43,214 --> 01:43:44,350
I won't come. You will. You will.

1096
01:43:44,374 --> 01:43:46,649
How can you refuse me? How can you?

1097
01:43:46,734 --> 01:43:48,550
Come on, touch our master's feet.
What happened?

1098
01:43:48,574 --> 01:43:49,643
What's going on?

1099
01:43:50,054 --> 01:43:51,646
Only you can give us justice, master.

1100
01:43:51,894 --> 01:43:55,807
Salma has made my life hell,
it has caused me great agony.

1101
01:43:55,894 --> 01:43:57,964
Drink the water, you'll feel better.

1102
01:43:58,134 --> 01:44:00,125
Who will bring water for this mule?

1103
01:44:00,294 --> 01:44:01,966
Go and drink it yourselves.

1104
01:44:02,294 --> 01:44:04,489
Salma, be careful.
Don't call me a mule..

1105
01:44:04,574 --> 01:44:06,371
Otherwise I'll kick you..

1106
01:44:12,054 --> 01:44:14,284
Someone has lost his life
and someone laughs over it.

1107
01:44:14,374 --> 01:44:15,523
Hey, wait. Wait.

1108
01:44:30,374 --> 01:44:32,365
You don't trust my sword, do you?

1109
01:46:31,574 --> 01:46:33,212
You didn't trust my sword.

1110
01:46:34,374 --> 01:46:35,894
And you pushed me
when I was off guard.

1111
01:46:36,134 --> 01:46:38,364
Now, it's not feasible
to show mercy upon you.

1112
01:47:06,374 --> 01:47:08,365
I think he saved himself again.
Go and finish him.

1113
01:48:09,214 --> 01:48:10,283
Stop.

1114
01:48:10,374 --> 01:48:11,966
We don't need to kill him.

1115
01:48:12,654 --> 01:48:14,804
But it's dangerous for us
if he lives.

1116
01:48:15,294 --> 01:48:19,048
No, Sajid. We need him to be alive.

1117
01:48:19,574 --> 01:48:20,643
Take him.

1118
01:48:31,574 --> 01:48:32,643
Take a look.

1119
01:48:38,294 --> 01:48:40,094
Yes, some man is being
carried by the current.

1120
01:48:40,134 --> 01:48:41,647
Hey, come here. Save him.

1121
01:48:41,734 --> 01:48:42,883
Save him, at once.

1122
01:48:42,974 --> 01:48:44,805
- Come on.
- Just see over there.

1123
01:48:45,294 --> 01:48:47,046
Come, fast. Come. Come on.

1124
01:48:47,134 --> 01:48:49,364
Come on, save him. Come on. Come on.

1125
01:48:54,894 --> 01:48:57,044
Come on, go
and save that drowning man.

1126
01:49:03,294 --> 01:49:04,363
Come on.

1127
01:50:08,574 --> 01:50:09,643
Who are you?

1128
01:50:10,894 --> 01:50:11,963
Who are you people?

1129
01:50:15,294 --> 01:50:16,363
Where am I?

1130
01:50:19,814 --> 01:50:20,883
Who am I?

1131
01:50:23,294 --> 01:50:24,363
Who am I?

1132
01:50:26,814 --> 01:50:27,883
Who am I?

1133
01:50:28,134 --> 01:50:29,283
Who am I?

1134
01:50:39,374 --> 01:50:41,126
This is prince Yemen.

1135
01:50:42,054 --> 01:50:43,453
How could you tell this?

1136
01:50:44,134 --> 01:50:45,453
Because of the royal ornament.

1137
01:50:46,694 --> 01:50:48,685
Now, our task has become quite easy.

1138
01:50:50,614 --> 01:50:53,970
Your Excellency,
I am sorry that I couldn't..

1139
01:50:54,054 --> 01:50:57,126
Make it in time
with my two officers.

1140
01:50:57,614 --> 01:50:59,206
Dacoits fled as they saw us coming.

1141
01:50:59,534 --> 01:51:02,970
But our brave commander
put his life in danger..

1142
01:51:03,054 --> 01:51:06,285
And captured the leader
of those dacoits.

1143
01:51:06,534 --> 01:51:08,843
After that, we started
searching for Prince.

1144
01:51:09,134 --> 01:51:11,967
But sorry to say,
that prince's body..

1145
01:51:12,054 --> 01:51:14,443
Must have been carried
by the river.

1146
01:51:14,614 --> 01:51:18,448
Why are you quiet after
murdering my beloved son?

1147
01:51:18,774 --> 01:51:19,843
Why don't you speak?

1148
01:51:21,374 --> 01:51:23,842
Zabak, you can say something
in your defence.

1149
01:51:25,294 --> 01:51:26,363
Please say it.

1150
01:51:28,774 --> 01:51:30,814
His silence tells us that
he has accepted the crime.

1151
01:51:31,694 --> 01:51:34,527
Today, my world has been
hurled into the darkness.

1152
01:51:36,694 --> 01:51:39,003
I lost my beloved son.

1153
01:51:39,534 --> 01:51:41,286
You haven't lost your son.

1154
01:51:43,374 --> 01:51:45,683
Hail prince Yemen.

1155
01:51:59,214 --> 01:52:00,442
My son is alive.

1156
01:52:01,374 --> 01:52:02,443
He is alive.

1157
01:52:03,134 --> 01:52:04,772
Son. Son.

1158
01:52:06,054 --> 01:52:07,123
God is merciful.

1159
01:52:08,294 --> 01:52:12,970
Dear, I swear by God,
I'll torture the..

1160
01:52:13,054 --> 01:52:15,045
One who has tormented you.

1161
01:52:17,134 --> 01:52:20,524
What happens is God's will.

1162
01:52:21,614 --> 01:52:24,970
Your Excellency, till now,
I would think that..

1163
01:52:25,054 --> 01:52:28,046
Lord was tormenting
my sins in strange ways.

1164
01:52:28,974 --> 01:52:30,043
But no.

1165
01:52:30,454 --> 01:52:32,206
God can honour anyone He wants to.

1166
01:52:32,694 --> 01:52:34,127
And humiliate the one He wishes to.

1167
01:52:35,134 --> 01:52:36,965
Prince himself will
give a statement..

1168
01:52:37,054 --> 01:52:39,045
About who had attacked him.

1169
01:52:39,454 --> 01:52:41,285
Was it me or was it this brute?

1170
01:52:41,454 --> 01:52:43,126
Idiot, I'll pull out your tongue.

1171
01:52:43,214 --> 01:52:44,283
Stop right there.

1172
01:52:44,454 --> 01:52:45,853
The justice asks for patience.

1173
01:52:50,774 --> 01:52:52,054
So rightly said, Chief minister.

1174
01:52:53,694 --> 01:52:56,606
Dear, which brute had attacked you?

1175
01:53:01,054 --> 01:53:02,123
Samina.

1176
01:53:05,054 --> 01:53:06,123
Samina.

1177
01:53:09,054 --> 01:53:10,123
Samina.

1178
01:53:11,614 --> 01:53:13,844
Speak clearly, Prince.

1179
01:53:15,054 --> 01:53:16,123
Prince?

1180
01:53:18,614 --> 01:53:21,208
Who am I?

1181
01:53:22,774 --> 01:53:23,843
Who am I?

1182
01:53:25,214 --> 01:53:26,283
Samina.

1183
01:53:27,694 --> 01:53:29,764
Samina, what's all this?

1184
01:53:29,854 --> 01:53:30,969
Oh, dear God.

1185
01:53:37,694 --> 01:53:43,052
Unfortunately,
Prince has lost his memory.

1186
01:53:44,054 --> 01:53:47,967
Your Excellency,
the real culprit is not..

1187
01:53:48,054 --> 01:53:49,374
Commander Kasim, but this man.

1188
01:53:49,974 --> 01:53:52,613
Gypsy girl, how can you so be sure?

1189
01:53:53,854 --> 01:53:55,333
I had witnessed this
from a distance.

1190
01:53:56,494 --> 01:53:59,645
I was strolling near
the river bank with my friends.

1191
01:54:00,414 --> 01:54:03,247
Suddenly, I heard few noises
from the mountain top.

1192
01:54:03,934 --> 01:54:06,846
I saw this brute
fighting with Prince.

1193
01:54:07,494 --> 01:54:09,325
- He pushed him.
- Samina.

1194
01:54:12,854 --> 01:54:15,004
And then Prince let out
a scream and fell down.

1195
01:54:16,654 --> 01:54:19,771
But as this brute was there,
so was the God.

1196
01:54:19,854 --> 01:54:21,003
But Your Excellency, I..

1197
01:54:21,094 --> 01:54:22,163
Keep quiet, you brute.

1198
01:54:22,494 --> 01:54:24,405
I don't wish to hear
anything from you.

1199
01:54:25,254 --> 01:54:30,772
Your Excellency,
sorry to interrupt but..

1200
01:54:30,854 --> 01:54:32,333
Everyone has a right to justice.

1201
01:54:38,934 --> 01:54:42,404
Tell us, what did you want
to say in your defence?

1202
01:54:46,574 --> 01:54:47,643
Nothing.

1203
01:54:48,854 --> 01:54:51,243
I'll let fate decide
about my innocence.

1204
01:54:51,774 --> 01:54:54,493
It means you haven't
got any evidence.

1205
01:54:54,934 --> 01:54:56,003
Take away this brute.

1206
01:54:56,254 --> 01:54:58,643
And hang him in the square
the next week.

1207
01:55:12,174 --> 01:55:14,813
I think our sire's luck
is absolutely brilliant.

1208
01:55:15,174 --> 01:55:16,653
Hats off to you, sire.

1209
01:55:16,854 --> 01:55:18,651
The prince has lost his memory.

1210
01:55:18,774 --> 01:55:20,253
And the girl has lost her head.

1211
01:55:20,934 --> 01:55:23,084
After all, she is an ignorant.

1212
01:55:25,174 --> 01:55:27,768
"When someone laughs at me.."

1213
01:55:27,854 --> 01:55:30,163
"For being an ignorant.."

1214
01:55:31,334 --> 01:55:36,169
"Even I feel like laughing
at his own ignorance."

1215
01:55:42,014 --> 01:55:45,165
Samina, so, you lied for a reason?

1216
01:55:46,094 --> 01:55:47,652
Think what you wish to.

1217
01:55:48,494 --> 01:55:50,485
But why did you save me?

1218
01:55:50,934 --> 01:55:56,406
I could fulfil my wish
by saving you.

1219
01:55:57,774 --> 01:55:59,844
Tell me clearly what do you want?

1220
01:56:01,854 --> 01:56:05,483
I can make you a king if I want to.

1221
01:56:07,334 --> 01:56:08,403
A king?

1222
01:56:09,414 --> 01:56:12,645
So, tell me quickly,
how can I become an emperor?

1223
01:56:13,334 --> 01:56:16,804
- Just follow my orders.
- I agree.

1224
01:56:19,334 --> 01:56:24,647
Isn't there any solution which
can bring back Prince's memory?

1225
01:56:27,574 --> 01:56:31,647
Pardon me, Your Excellency.
There's only one solution.

1226
01:56:32,174 --> 01:56:35,086
Tell me.
Please tell me for God's sake.

1227
01:56:36,094 --> 01:56:38,244
Prince was in love with Zainab.

1228
01:56:38,934 --> 01:56:41,767
If Zainab would be presented
in front of..

1229
01:56:41,854 --> 01:56:44,846
Him in a special way,
then he might recover his memory.

1230
01:56:48,574 --> 01:56:51,930
Samina, I give this task to you.

1231
01:56:52,574 --> 01:56:53,643
Make the arrangements.

1232
01:56:54,174 --> 01:56:55,323
As you wish, Sire.

1233
01:56:57,494 --> 01:57:01,646
- Samina.
- Please rest. I'll be back.

1234
01:57:22,094 --> 01:57:24,403
Samina, how could you do this?

1235
01:57:25,014 --> 01:57:26,925
How could you blame Zabak
for nothing?

1236
01:57:27,494 --> 01:57:31,248
So, you crave for him, don't you?

1237
01:57:32,014 --> 01:57:34,403
Craving is inevitable in love.

1238
01:57:35,254 --> 01:57:39,247
Samina, you know very well
that Zabak is an innocent.

1239
01:57:40,334 --> 01:57:43,644
How can you say that Zabak
hasn't attacked Prince?

1240
01:57:44,174 --> 01:57:46,244
You were in your palace resting
I assume.

1241
01:57:46,574 --> 01:57:51,489
My heart says that Zabak can't
have anyone's blood on his hands.

1242
01:57:51,574 --> 01:57:54,327
It's true that Zabak
has proved to be a cheat.

1243
01:57:54,934 --> 01:57:56,083
Have mercy, Samina.

1244
01:57:56,854 --> 01:57:58,253
For God's sake, have mercy.

1245
01:57:58,574 --> 01:58:01,486
Mercy? Why should I
show mercy to him?

1246
01:58:01,934 --> 01:58:04,767
The one who has broken my heart..

1247
01:58:05,494 --> 01:58:06,563
No, Zainab.

1248
01:58:06,934 --> 01:58:09,846
Zabak won't belong to anyone
else if he can't belong to me.

1249
01:58:10,854 --> 01:58:13,652
Samina, I beg of you.

1250
01:58:14,654 --> 01:58:16,485
Even you are a woman.

1251
01:58:16,854 --> 01:58:20,642
Don't worry.
You won't be married to Prince.

1252
01:58:21,934 --> 01:58:24,926
I.. I didn't understand
what you said.

1253
01:58:25,254 --> 01:58:27,245
There's a lot that
you can't understand.

1254
02:02:03,854 --> 02:02:04,923
Zainab.

1255
02:02:47,774 --> 02:02:48,843
Samina.

1256
02:02:49,934 --> 02:02:51,083
Beloved Samina.

1257
02:02:51,254 --> 02:02:53,927
Prince, this is Zainab.

1258
02:02:54,574 --> 02:02:58,249
Zainab? Who?

1259
02:03:00,334 --> 02:03:01,926
Samina, who is she?

1260
02:03:02,574 --> 02:03:03,643
Who is she?

1261
02:03:04,854 --> 02:03:10,645
Unfortunately,
all the efforts are useless.

1262
02:03:11,334 --> 02:03:13,643
The disease became worse
from bad even after the cure.

1263
02:03:14,414 --> 02:03:16,769
Your Excellency,
only lancet can achieve..

1264
02:03:16,854 --> 02:03:18,924
The result and not the medication.

1265
02:03:19,414 --> 02:03:21,245
- But..
- What?

1266
02:03:21,574 --> 02:03:25,931
Healer like me is of no use, only
an experienced surgeon can do this.

1267
02:03:26,934 --> 02:03:29,084
So, declare that in whole city..

1268
02:03:29,494 --> 02:03:32,770
The person who brings
back Prince's memory..

1269
02:03:32,854 --> 02:03:37,006
Will get anything
that he asks for.

1270
02:03:58,934 --> 02:04:02,643
Zabak, tell us if
you've any last wish.

1271
02:04:03,174 --> 02:04:04,323
It'll be fulfilled for sure.

1272
02:04:07,094 --> 02:04:08,925
My mother resides in Iswahaan.

1273
02:04:09,854 --> 02:04:13,767
Tell her that her son
is getting punished..

1274
02:04:13,854 --> 02:04:15,492
For the crime he didn't commit.

1275
02:04:16,494 --> 02:04:19,770
But my conscience tells me
that I'm paying for..

1276
02:04:19,854 --> 02:04:24,644
The sin of attacking
my own motherland.

1277
02:04:33,934 --> 02:04:37,085
It's God's grace
and the emperor rules.

1278
02:04:37,854 --> 02:04:41,767
Every subject is informed that
King of Yemen's beloved son..

1279
02:04:41,854 --> 02:04:46,405
Prince Parvez has
a mental disorder.

1280
02:04:47,174 --> 02:04:48,766
The person is will able
to treat him..

1281
02:04:48,854 --> 02:04:51,414
Will be given
whatever he asks for.

1282
02:04:52,254 --> 02:04:55,769
Is there anyone
who dares to save the..

1283
02:04:55,854 --> 02:04:57,492
Sole heir of Kingdom of Yemen?

1284
02:05:01,334 --> 02:05:04,644
Oh, God, you have strange ways.

1285
02:05:06,854 --> 02:05:11,484
Sire, if I am given a chance,
then I can treat him for sure.

1286
02:05:12,174 --> 02:05:15,484
Sire, this idiot is playing
some trick to save his neck.

1287
02:05:15,854 --> 02:05:18,163
I value my promise more
than my life.

1288
02:05:19,334 --> 02:05:21,484
I've learned this art
from my deceased father.

1289
02:05:22,094 --> 02:05:23,243
What was his name?

1290
02:05:24,654 --> 02:05:26,406
Hasan Shah Iswahaan.

1291
02:05:26,774 --> 02:05:27,843
That one?

1292
02:05:28,014 --> 02:05:30,084
The famous surgeon and the healer?

1293
02:05:30,334 --> 02:05:33,770
A man who would run
a parlour and was..

1294
02:05:33,854 --> 02:05:35,412
Punished for his crimes.

1295
02:05:35,934 --> 02:05:38,084
We're not concerned about the past.

1296
02:05:38,934 --> 02:05:44,645
If Zabak is his son then
he can surely treat Prince.

1297
02:05:46,014 --> 02:05:47,811
But you've been given
a death sentence.

1298
02:05:49,494 --> 02:05:54,090
I can only leave
if someone gives a bail for you.

1299
02:05:54,774 --> 02:05:55,843
I'll do that.

1300
02:05:56,574 --> 02:05:58,087
There is one more condition.

1301
02:05:58,334 --> 02:06:00,484
I am ready to accept
thousand conditions.

1302
02:06:00,854 --> 02:06:03,766
Listen, if Zabak is
unsuccessful then..

1303
02:06:03,854 --> 02:06:05,810
Even you'll be hanged with him.

1304
02:06:07,174 --> 02:06:11,406
Even I will be hanged.
Sire, I take my words back.

1305
02:06:11,574 --> 02:06:13,849
Even your father will
agree to these terms.

1306
02:06:14,014 --> 02:06:15,083
Then call my father.

1307
02:06:16,174 --> 02:06:20,486
Sire, if this man is not ready,
then I am ready to do this.

1308
02:06:20,854 --> 02:06:22,003
I'll give him the bail.

1309
02:06:22,254 --> 02:06:23,323
No, no, Salma.

1310
02:06:23,574 --> 02:06:26,771
If you're hanged
at the scaffold then even..

1311
02:06:26,854 --> 02:06:28,333
I'll suffer for all my life.

1312
02:06:29,934 --> 02:06:31,765
Sire, I agree to this.

1313
02:06:34,094 --> 02:06:35,163
Free Zabak.

1314
02:06:49,094 --> 02:06:52,404
Zabak, are you sure
that you'll be successful?

1315
02:06:53,574 --> 02:06:58,250
Sire, man's efforts go in vain
if God is not with him.

1316
02:06:58,334 --> 02:06:59,403
Just listen to him.

1317
02:06:59,494 --> 02:07:01,928
He's trying to save his neck right
from this moment.

1318
02:07:11,414 --> 02:07:13,006
God has shown me the way.

1319
02:07:13,774 --> 02:07:18,643
- Sire, I needed these clouds.
- Clouds?

1320
02:07:19,094 --> 02:07:20,163
Yes, sire.

1321
02:07:20,254 --> 02:07:22,768
If these clouds produce
lightening then I'll behold..

1322
02:07:22,854 --> 02:07:26,927
That lightening and bring
back Prince's memory in flash.

1323
02:07:28,174 --> 02:07:31,007
Oh, Lord of skies, help me, please.

1324
02:07:36,774 --> 02:07:44,647
"Oh, protector of the poor."

1325
02:07:45,254 --> 02:07:52,490
"You remove everyone's obstacles."

1326
02:07:53,254 --> 02:07:56,769
"You help the sages.."

1327
02:07:56,854 --> 02:08:00,563
". .And save orphans."

1328
02:08:00,854 --> 02:08:03,766
"You heal the wounds
of your own and.."

1329
02:08:03,854 --> 02:08:07,563
". .Those who doesn't belong to you."

1330
02:08:08,254 --> 02:08:12,406
"We ask for your help.."

1331
02:08:12,774 --> 02:08:16,653
". .Oh, Lord of two worlds."

1332
02:08:16,774 --> 02:08:20,562
"You're our only hope.."

1333
02:08:20,854 --> 02:08:24,767
". .Oh, Lord of two worlds."

1334
02:08:25,014 --> 02:08:29,007
"We ask for your help."

1335
02:08:39,934 --> 02:08:43,085
"We all are helpless."

1336
02:08:43,174 --> 02:08:47,850
"You're powerful and able."

1337
02:08:48,254 --> 02:08:51,246
"We all are helpless."

1338
02:08:51,414 --> 02:08:55,930
"You're powerful and able."

1339
02:08:56,494 --> 02:09:00,772
"You're the cure that can.."

1340
02:09:00,854 --> 02:09:04,324
". .Cure any ailment."

1341
02:09:04,774 --> 02:09:08,403
"You know our pain.."

1342
02:09:08,774 --> 02:09:12,608
". .Oh, Lord of two worlds."

1343
02:09:12,934 --> 02:09:16,768
"We ask for your help."

1344
02:09:27,494 --> 02:09:31,487
"There's no obstacle.."

1345
02:09:31,574 --> 02:09:35,089
". .That you haven't trampled."

1346
02:09:35,574 --> 02:09:39,772
"There's no obstacle.."

1347
02:09:39,854 --> 02:09:43,085
". .That you haven't trampled."

1348
02:09:43,654 --> 02:09:47,772
"Anyone who has come to you.."

1349
02:09:47,854 --> 02:09:51,483
". .You have helped him."

1350
02:09:51,774 --> 02:09:55,483
"You're ocean and the shore."

1351
02:09:55,774 --> 02:09:59,483
"You own the two worlds."

1352
02:09:59,854 --> 02:10:03,642
"We ask for your help.."

1353
02:10:03,934 --> 02:10:08,007
". .Oh, Lord of two worlds."

1354
02:10:10,494 --> 02:10:14,567
"Oh, Lord of two worlds."

1355
02:10:16,254 --> 02:10:21,851
"Oh, Lord of two worlds."

1356
02:10:42,174 --> 02:10:44,005
His heartbeat seems fine.

1357
02:10:51,174 --> 02:10:53,642
God willing,
he'll gain consciousness soon.

1358
02:11:09,094 --> 02:11:13,929
Healer. What's going on here?

1359
02:11:14,094 --> 02:11:16,847
God is merciful.
Your memory is back.

1360
02:11:18,654 --> 02:11:19,769
Where is my father?

1361
02:11:19,854 --> 02:11:21,492
Prince, you must be patient.

1362
02:11:21,574 --> 02:11:23,087
You need to rest.

1363
02:11:25,494 --> 02:11:27,485
Congrats, Your Excellency.
Congrats.

1364
02:11:29,654 --> 02:11:31,087
The Prince has got his memory back.

1365
02:11:31,174 --> 02:11:32,323
God is merciful.

1366
02:11:32,414 --> 02:11:33,483
God is merciful.

1367
02:11:33,574 --> 02:11:35,485
Shower him with pearls.

1368
02:11:35,774 --> 02:11:37,332
Donate money to the poor.

1369
02:11:37,774 --> 02:11:40,004
Light lamps in the royal mosque.

1370
02:11:40,174 --> 02:11:42,642
Bathe the entire city in lights.

1371
02:11:42,774 --> 02:11:45,572
Arrange for the grand event.

1372
02:11:45,934 --> 02:11:47,652
Go and celebrate.

1373
02:11:48,334 --> 02:11:49,926
God has heard our pleas.

1374
02:11:50,014 --> 02:11:51,830
- God is merciful. God is merciful.
- There is only one God.

1375
02:11:51,854 --> 02:11:52,990
- God is merciful.
- There is only one God.

1376
02:11:53,014 --> 02:11:54,367
Go. Come on, move. Come on.

1377
02:11:55,174 --> 02:11:57,165
Come, sire.
Let's congratulate Zabak.

1378
02:11:57,254 --> 02:11:58,323
Let's move.

1379
02:12:04,094 --> 02:12:06,085
We're doomed now.
What should we do?

1380
02:12:06,414 --> 02:12:07,534
Samina, what do you suggest?

1381
02:12:07,774 --> 02:12:08,843
Don't be afraid.

1382
02:12:09,014 --> 02:12:10,766
We have still got our final plan.

1383
02:12:11,174 --> 02:12:13,324
Just follow what I tell you.

1384
02:12:13,774 --> 02:12:14,843
Listen.

1385
02:12:15,334 --> 02:12:16,926
- Parvez. My son.
- Father.

1386
02:12:17,174 --> 02:12:18,653
- My darling son.
- Father.

1387
02:12:19,094 --> 02:12:20,243
God is great.

1388
02:12:20,854 --> 02:12:23,846
Your skills are proven beyond doubt.

1389
02:12:23,934 --> 02:12:25,162
Yes, why not? Why not?

1390
02:12:25,254 --> 02:12:27,484
He's our guardian angel.

1391
02:12:28,374 --> 02:12:30,763
We could have been hanged
till death..

1392
02:12:30,854 --> 02:12:32,082
If he would have failed.

1393
02:12:32,854 --> 02:12:36,244
What can I do without God's grace?

1394
02:12:38,574 --> 02:12:42,328
Your Excellency, you can ask Prince
who had attacked him.

1395
02:12:43,014 --> 02:12:44,083
Who else can he be?

1396
02:12:44,574 --> 02:12:46,929
Traitor Kasim and his henchmen.

1397
02:12:47,934 --> 02:12:50,573
They had pushed me off the cliff.

1398
02:12:51,934 --> 02:12:53,390
Now, I am going to exact
my revenge against him.

1399
02:12:53,414 --> 02:12:56,087
No, Prince, you should rest now.

1400
02:12:56,174 --> 02:12:58,404
Zabak, please take care of him.

1401
02:12:58,774 --> 02:13:01,083
Prince, please rest. Lie down.

1402
02:13:01,494 --> 02:13:03,769
Chief minister,
I want to give severe punishment..

1403
02:13:03,854 --> 02:13:06,493
To the brutes who attacked my son.

1404
02:13:07,174 --> 02:13:08,653
- He's here.
- Come on.

1405
02:13:09,254 --> 02:13:11,085
Kasim, I've recognised
your true identity.

1406
02:13:11,174 --> 02:13:13,005
Get lost! How dare you?

1407
02:13:13,094 --> 02:13:15,244
You're a traitor.
I won't let you go.

1408
02:13:15,334 --> 02:13:17,165
I am going to tell your
secret to the emperor.

1409
02:13:17,254 --> 02:13:18,750
Get off me, girl.
Otherwise, I'll kill you.

1410
02:13:18,774 --> 02:13:20,332
- Let go of me.
- Get away.

1411
02:13:34,774 --> 02:13:36,332
Traitors have escaped.

1412
02:13:39,934 --> 02:13:44,485
Samina, what's all this?

1413
02:13:48,774 --> 02:13:51,334
Forgive me, Your Excellency.
Forgive me.

1414
02:13:51,494 --> 02:13:53,644
I am your culprit.
I have committed a sin.

1415
02:13:53,774 --> 02:13:54,843
Please forgive me.

1416
02:13:54,934 --> 02:13:56,003
Samina.

1417
02:13:56,414 --> 02:13:59,008
What's all this? Tell me clearly.

1418
02:14:00,414 --> 02:14:02,006
I want you to confess it.

1419
02:14:02,254 --> 02:14:05,769
Your Excellency,
when you were being ushered..

1420
02:14:05,854 --> 02:14:07,845
Inside, I overheard
Kasim and his..

1421
02:14:07,934 --> 02:14:09,454
Henchmen whispering
about something.

1422
02:14:09,774 --> 02:14:13,369
Then I realised that
my eyes had deceived me.

1423
02:14:13,774 --> 02:14:15,765
It was not Zabak
but that idiot Kasim..

1424
02:14:15,854 --> 02:14:17,845
Who had pushed Prince
off the cliff.

1425
02:14:18,494 --> 02:14:23,409
I tried to stop him so that
I could payback for my crimes.

1426
02:14:24,254 --> 02:14:27,007
But unfortunately, I couldn't do it.

1427
02:14:27,414 --> 02:14:29,006
Forgive me, Your Excellency.

1428
02:14:29,494 --> 02:14:30,847
Forgive me.

1429
02:14:31,774 --> 02:14:35,767
I think it was a grave mistake.
And because..

1430
02:14:35,854 --> 02:14:40,325
You're ashamed of your deed,
I forgive you.

1431
02:14:40,494 --> 02:14:42,246
May His Excellency live long.

1432
02:14:46,654 --> 02:14:49,487
I think something's fishy here.

1433
02:15:03,014 --> 02:15:05,323
Why don't you use that
lancet for my heart?

1434
02:15:10,774 --> 02:15:11,843
Zainab?

1435
02:15:16,614 --> 02:15:18,605
This is for the ones
who have suffered.

1436
02:15:23,774 --> 02:15:26,004
Who must have suffered more than me?

1437
02:15:26,494 --> 02:15:27,847
How can you say that, Zainab?

1438
02:15:28,174 --> 02:15:30,927
You can take out an arrow
from man's heart.

1439
02:15:32,854 --> 02:15:35,243
Can't you take out my heart from me?

1440
02:15:40,494 --> 02:15:42,086
God himself resides in the heart.

1441
02:15:43,254 --> 02:15:45,324
But it's also filled with love.

1442
02:15:46,254 --> 02:15:50,645
If it's devoid of love,
then what's the use?

1443
02:15:51,334 --> 02:15:54,087
Well, the truth is that
you're the would-be queen of Yemen.

1444
02:15:58,094 --> 02:16:01,325
I am nothing more than a toy
at the hands of destiny.

1445
02:16:01,854 --> 02:16:04,766
Zainab, how can you
expect something from me..

1446
02:16:04,854 --> 02:16:06,934
When His Excellency has
already decided your fate?

1447
02:16:07,094 --> 02:16:10,848
Zabak, I agree to his decision.

1448
02:16:11,414 --> 02:16:12,614
Then what can I do about that?

1449
02:16:13,574 --> 02:16:14,643
Everything.

1450
02:16:15,574 --> 02:16:16,643
I didn't get you.

1451
02:16:17,774 --> 02:16:20,572
Promise me, and then
I'll explain you.

1452
02:16:26,854 --> 02:16:29,493
You can rob a treasure
for Usman Aaga.

1453
02:16:29,774 --> 02:16:32,607
You can sacrifice your love
for the emperor.

1454
02:16:32,933 --> 02:16:34,491
Can't you make a promise for me?

1455
02:16:34,574 --> 02:16:35,848
Stop it, Zainab. Stop it.

1456
02:16:37,574 --> 02:16:38,643
I promise.

1457
02:16:40,853 --> 02:16:43,765
Tomorrow, there's gala
arranged to celebrate..

1458
02:16:43,853 --> 02:16:47,766
For Prince's speedy recovery
and I want you to..

1459
02:16:47,853 --> 02:16:52,244
Ask for your future bride
from the emperor.

1460
02:16:57,494 --> 02:16:58,563
Why are you so quiet?

1461
02:17:01,254 --> 02:17:02,846
How can you forget
your promise so soon?

1462
02:17:11,773 --> 02:17:14,412
I will ask for my future bride
from the emperor.

1463
02:18:20,093 --> 02:18:23,085
"The desires glow."

1464
02:18:23,334 --> 02:18:26,167
"And lovers lost their lives."

1465
02:18:26,414 --> 02:18:27,733
"How could you not know?"

1466
02:18:27,894 --> 02:18:31,330
"This sad little story of lovers."

1467
02:18:32,654 --> 02:18:35,487
"The desires glow."

1468
02:18:35,814 --> 02:18:38,567
"And lovers lost their lives."

1469
02:18:39,093 --> 02:18:40,412
"How could you not know?"

1470
02:18:40,494 --> 02:18:43,964
"This sad little story of lovers."

1471
02:18:45,254 --> 02:18:48,166
"The desires glow."

1472
02:19:00,814 --> 02:19:03,726
"May you have pleasant nights."

1473
02:19:03,894 --> 02:19:06,567
"And sensual days."

1474
02:19:10,174 --> 02:19:13,086
"They pray for you.."

1475
02:19:13,174 --> 02:19:15,642
"Your own ardent lovers."

1476
02:19:16,093 --> 02:19:19,085
"May you be blessed with.."

1477
02:19:19,174 --> 02:19:21,563
"Immense happiness."

1478
02:19:22,654 --> 02:19:25,487
"The desires glow."

1479
02:19:25,734 --> 02:19:28,487
"And lovers lost their lives."

1480
02:19:28,974 --> 02:19:32,091
"How could you not know?"

1481
02:19:32,174 --> 02:19:33,971
"This sad little story of lovers."

1482
02:19:35,093 --> 02:19:37,971
"The desires glow."

1483
02:20:09,254 --> 02:20:11,085
"My desires.."

1484
02:20:11,174 --> 02:20:13,165
"They make me crave.."

1485
02:20:13,254 --> 02:20:15,085
". .For the whole day."

1486
02:20:21,814 --> 02:20:24,567
"You've given this pain."

1487
02:20:24,974 --> 02:20:27,249
"May you take it away."

1488
02:20:27,694 --> 02:20:31,084
"That's how you care.."

1489
02:20:31,174 --> 02:20:33,085
". .For an ordinary people like us."

1490
02:20:34,254 --> 02:20:36,973
"The desires glow."

1491
02:20:55,494 --> 02:20:58,566
"We burn like flame."

1492
02:20:58,814 --> 02:21:01,328
"And think about you."

1493
02:21:04,894 --> 02:21:07,567
"I agonise in craving."

1494
02:21:08,094 --> 02:21:10,733
"But I admire the one
who did it to me."

1495
02:21:10,894 --> 02:21:14,091
"Your charm thus has.."

1496
02:21:14,174 --> 02:21:16,085
". .Defeated me all the way."

1497
02:21:17,414 --> 02:21:20,167
"The desires glow."

1498
02:21:20,494 --> 02:21:23,167
"And lovers lost their lives."

1499
02:21:23,574 --> 02:21:24,893
"How could you not know?"

1500
02:21:25,094 --> 02:21:28,404
"This sad little story of lovers."

1501
02:21:29,494 --> 02:21:32,645
"The desires glow."

1502
02:22:20,094 --> 02:22:21,573
That was brilliant, girl.

1503
02:22:22,814 --> 02:22:24,964
I was extremely pleased
with your dancing skills.

1504
02:22:30,094 --> 02:22:34,087
Samina has not only
showed her skills..

1505
02:22:34,174 --> 02:22:37,928
But also brought together friends
and foes alike.

1506
02:22:39,094 --> 02:22:44,327
But Zabak, this happiness
was not possible without you.

1507
02:22:44,974 --> 02:22:46,374
You can ask anything that you want.

1508
02:22:47,734 --> 02:22:51,090
Your Excellency,
I want to ask for something..

1509
02:22:51,174 --> 02:22:54,803
Which will honour my state
and your love too.

1510
02:22:55,414 --> 02:22:56,563
I want to ask for my bride.

1511
02:23:01,414 --> 02:23:02,483
Bride?

1512
02:23:03,574 --> 02:23:06,407
- But Father..
- Have patience, dear.

1513
02:23:07,414 --> 02:23:10,804
- Let me fulfil Zabak's wish.
- Thank you, Your Excellency.

1514
02:23:18,654 --> 02:23:19,803
This is my bride.

1515
02:23:24,334 --> 02:23:26,802
Zabak, how can you say this?

1516
02:23:27,894 --> 02:23:30,249
My fate has forced me to say this.

1517
02:23:30,574 --> 02:23:32,326
I give you the bride.

1518
02:23:33,094 --> 02:23:35,847
I will personally arrange
for Samina and Zabak's wedding.

1519
02:23:36,094 --> 02:23:38,654
No, Your Excellency.
No. This is not possible.

1520
02:23:39,174 --> 02:23:40,323
I am a culprit.

1521
02:23:40,574 --> 02:23:43,247
But I have forgiven you long back.

1522
02:23:44,174 --> 02:23:47,883
Zabak, you're an angel,
and not a man.

1523
02:23:48,694 --> 02:23:51,447
Your Excellency,
I was blinded by lust.

1524
02:23:51,694 --> 02:23:55,733
I became traitor. I betrayed
you in return of your favour.

1525
02:23:55,894 --> 02:23:57,725
I called upon the foes
of our nation.

1526
02:23:57,814 --> 02:24:00,328
Stop them.
Stop them, Your Excellency.

1527
02:24:00,414 --> 02:24:01,893
Otherwise they all will be here.

1528
02:24:01,974 --> 02:24:03,965
They're already here, I dare say.

1529
02:24:13,254 --> 02:24:15,563
Kasim, you're a traitor.

1530
02:24:15,814 --> 02:24:18,009
A man who takes over the power is..

1531
02:24:18,094 --> 02:24:20,085
Called an emperor
and not a traitor.

1532
02:24:20,174 --> 02:24:21,892
And now, this throne belongs to me.

1533
02:24:22,094 --> 02:24:23,163
Attack.

1534
02:24:34,014 --> 02:24:35,242
Kasim, back off.

1535
02:24:35,494 --> 02:24:36,563
I will kill him.

1536
02:24:57,494 --> 02:25:00,088
Fate has brought us together again.

1537
02:25:02,174 --> 02:25:06,247
Kasim, your death is
calling you today.

1538
02:25:56,494 --> 02:25:57,563
Stop it.

1539
02:25:58,494 --> 02:26:00,007
Stop this fight.

1540
02:26:01,174 --> 02:26:02,812
Throw down your weapons.

1541
02:26:15,494 --> 02:26:20,363
Samina, dear, don't leave me.

1542
02:26:22,814 --> 02:26:25,851
Samina. I won't let you die.

1543
02:26:26,734 --> 02:26:29,089
I am going to keep you alive.

1544
02:26:30,254 --> 02:26:31,687
Open your eyes, Samina.

1545
02:26:34,494 --> 02:26:37,327
You opened my eyes..

1546
02:26:38,334 --> 02:26:44,489
When you sacrificed your love
for our motherland.

1547
02:26:45,654 --> 02:26:51,092
Now, I am going
to close them forever.

1548
02:26:53,574 --> 02:26:56,646
Goodbye, Father.

1549
02:27:00,814 --> 02:27:07,003
I strived to achieve
the wealth for her..

1550
02:27:09,654 --> 02:27:11,326
But unfortunately
she has left me.

1551
02:27:14,494 --> 02:27:16,883
All my ideas are in vain.

1552
02:27:18,014 --> 02:27:23,486
You forgot that ideas
are nothing before fate.

1553
02:27:24,414 --> 02:27:27,087
But my idea has defeated fate.

1554
02:28:23,334 --> 02:28:25,086
No. No.

1555
02:28:57,014 --> 02:28:58,083
Zabak.

1556
02:30:21,814 --> 02:30:23,327
- Zainab.
- Zabak.

1557
02:30:35,814 --> 02:30:37,327
Zabak. Zabak.

1558
02:30:37,734 --> 02:30:38,803
Let go of me.

1559
02:30:39,094 --> 02:30:40,163
Zabak.

1560
02:30:41,654 --> 02:30:42,723
Zabak.

1561
02:31:20,734 --> 02:31:22,850
Zabak. Zabak.

1562
02:33:22,014 --> 02:33:24,733
Zabak. Zabak.

1563
02:35:06,734 --> 02:35:09,009
I realised today that
humanity is the greatest..

1564
02:35:09,094 --> 02:35:10,413
Strength in this world.

1565
02:35:12,334 --> 02:35:13,562
Please forgive me, Zabak.

1566
02:35:17,414 --> 02:35:19,484
May you be happy with your love.

1567
02:35:20,654 --> 02:35:21,723
Chief minister.

1568
02:35:22,494 --> 02:35:25,247
Escort Zabak to Iswahaan.

1569
02:36:05,134 --> 02:36:07,170
Haji. Haji.

1570
02:36:07,494 --> 02:36:08,563
Lady, where are you going?

1571
02:36:08,654 --> 02:36:09,723
To my beloved Haji.

1572
02:36:09,814 --> 02:36:11,725
You're blind, you might fall down.

1573
02:36:12,134 --> 02:36:13,203
My son is coming.

1574
02:36:13,294 --> 02:36:15,854
Wait, lady.
Something untoward might happen.

1575
02:36:27,294 --> 02:36:29,569
- Mother.
- Haji.

1576
02:36:30,054 --> 02:36:31,373
- Haji.
- Mother.

1577
02:36:33,374 --> 02:36:36,127
- My beloved Zabak.
- My dear mother.

1578
02:36:36,574 --> 02:36:39,805
- My mother.
- I've got back my son.

1579
02:36:39,894 --> 02:36:43,807
Not only that.
Iswahaan got its new ruler.

1580
02:36:43,894 --> 02:36:46,362
Hail the new King.

1581
02:36:46,654 --> 02:36:47,723
Come, Mother.

1582
02:36:51,214 --> 02:36:53,205
Lord, your grace is great.

1583
02:36:53,814 --> 02:36:57,966
God's justice may be delayed,
but it's never denied.

1584
02:36:58,374 --> 02:37:01,491
Great patriot Zabak
has removed all the..

1585
02:37:01,574 --> 02:37:04,372
Dangers that were looming
large over Iswahaan.

1586
02:37:04,814 --> 02:37:08,363
And our state was blessed
with peace and prosperity.

1587
02:37:08,694 --> 02:37:12,482
May God bless beloved
Zabak with long life.

1588
02:37:12,574 --> 02:37:13,643
Amen.

1589
02:37:13,974 --> 02:37:16,488
Hail the motherland.

1590
02:37:17,214 --> 02:37:19,569
Hail King Zabak.

1591
02:37:20,054 --> 02:37:22,807
Hail King Zabak.

1592
02:37:23,574 --> 02:37:27,726
Wherever you go,
Zabak is being praised.

1593
02:37:27,814 --> 02:37:29,372
As if we didn't do anything.

1594
02:37:29,574 --> 02:37:30,643
Nothing.

1595
02:37:30,894 --> 02:37:33,124
Brothers. King of mules.

1596
02:37:33,494 --> 02:37:37,123
The mule king. Hail him.

1597
02:37:44,574 --> 02:37:46,292
That's great, my friend.

1598
02:37:46,494 --> 02:37:49,884
Only you care for me
in this whole state.
