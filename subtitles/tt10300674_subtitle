They say, Life should 
be like a flowing river

2
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,220
But, mine is diving 
like a waterfall

3
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:44,870
Every movie begins in silence.

4
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:48,050
But, My movie begins 
with violence.

5
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:52,050

I'm sitting right next 
to that person.

11
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,460

Gopal Krishna Gubbi

Though there are many 
other problems in the city

20
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,840
People are more worried 
about my marriage

21
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:31,600

to scout my bride

24
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:40,610

25
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,590

For Me, My husband 
and My child

33

Where is your Husband? 
- He's standing there

34
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,570
I listened to every 
astrologer I knew...

35
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,690
But...

36
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:09,350
Hello Madam,

37
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,390

Come let's get out of here...

00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,930
I became sure of one thing.

41
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:21,610
No matter how early I wake up...

42
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,960
I won't get a girl.

43
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:25,130
Now if I have to say 
something about Nani..

44
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,610
His Dad...

45
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:28,410
Is it a boy!?

46
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,130
I thought it would be a Girl.

47
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:33,530
So, He was born in confusion.

48
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:35,840
And that's the reason, 
He's always confused in life

49
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,500
This is my problem

50
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:39,520

70% of human body is water

58
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:06,700
Water has no life

59
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:08,440

00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:52,670
I'm so happy 
- which power?

185
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,220
No you shut up..

186
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,730
Madam, Sorry, Madam.

187
00:09:57,050 --> 00:10:00,500
Firstly I'll explain 
what I posses

188
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:01,920
My salary is 1.5 Lakhs

189
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:04,620
Really 
- dude, Don't say anything.

190
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:06,130
You should be transparent.

191
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,290
In that 1.5 Lakh, 
80 thousand...

192
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:09,420
Sir even you listen..

193
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,070
80 thousand is 
debited for home loan

194
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,820
Then, I give 30 thousand 
for house expenses

195
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:16,630
10-15 thousand rupees 
remain in my account.

196
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:18,100
Don't share those details..

197
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,720
Stop it, its not a problem

198
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,490
I can give that to you

199
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,850
Other than that...

200
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:25,040
I just have the excel 
file, I saved in my laptop.

201
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:27,550
I have not saved anything 
else, I am sorry.

202
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,480
Just shut-up and sit quite, 
how much do you blabber?

203
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,210
Mom!, You...

204
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:34,190
Why did you kidnap us?

205
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,260
Can't you wear nice clothes 
while you come outside?

206
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,990
What's wrong with this?

207
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:41,840
Isn't this nice? They say parent's 
love their child no matter what

208
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,580
You guys never liked me.

209
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:45,290
We like you, but...

210
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:49,010
You shouldn't look ugly to 
the girl you are about to see

211
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:50,740
Which girl sees me?

212
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,790
Now we are going to 
see a girl for you.

213
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,010
What!

214
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:56,550
Hello, My name is Alphiah

215
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:58,880
She's my wife Alpakumari

216
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:00,270
Hello

217
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:02,760
Go get Alpini

218
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:05,920
Who's the groom here?

219
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:09,230
Is he groom? 
- No, He's not a Man

220
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:11,470
Use the language properly.

221
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:14,340
Say he is not the groom.

222
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,860
What do you mean 
by he's not a Man?

223
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,980
I always say, get 
proper education.

224
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:22,090
you guys never listen

225
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:23,690
I'm Gopal Krishna Gubbi

226
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:25,720

Rukmini Gubbi.

227
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,780

228
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:30,070
Venkata Krishna Gubbi. 
- Dad call me Krissh.

229
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,760
He like's being called Krissh.

230
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:36,130
Did you guys have 
a love marriage?

231
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:38,430
Did he tell you that?

232
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:40,550
Yes, The thing is...

233
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:43,090
I had been to Manglore on work

234
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:45,070
People comeback 
eating fish from there

235
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,500
But I brought a fish from there.

236
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:52,420
Nobody's Laughing? 
- It's an old Joke

237
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:58,840
Why do you look sad, 
such a happy occasion?

238
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,220
The thing is..

239
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,660
In a society where they 
serve upma with fork

240
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,830
How can I look happy?

241
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,710
Sorry sorry..

242
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:11,030
It's a small mishap.

243
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:13,620
Alpini, while coming 
bring a spoon.

244
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,730
Come Sit.

245
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,970
She is My daughter Alpini.

246
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:41,750
She's beautiful...

247
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,680
Who's this...

248
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:49,980
Dad, Who is he...

249
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:51,600
Your Daughter is 
saying something?

250
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:53,360
It's nothing...

251
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:55,360
She's just saying..

252
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,060
If the groom had 
more hair on his head

253
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,580
he would have looked handsome.

254
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:00,770
You shut-up.

255
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:02,900
What do you mean by that, 
isn't he now?

256
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,130
My son's salary is 1.5 Lakhs

257
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:09,240
Take it 
- leave it...

258
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,620
It's OK, if there's 
less hair on the head

259
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,540
But if he had hair and no 
head, it would have been hard

260
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,580
Can you sing any song?

261
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:20,110
Uncle the thing is?

262
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:22,300
I have not learn 
anything academically

263
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,810
If you wish, 
I will sing few lines I know

264
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:26,220
Go on..

265
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,790
I knew you'd ask,

266
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,600
So I have written some lines.

267
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:32,440
Do we need this now? 
- She's very fast

268
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,760
In this note.

269
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:43,890
Voice is very good.

270
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:51,550
[Singing in Gibberish]

271
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,730
What's happening!?

272
00:13:53,750 --> 00:14:02,560
[Singing in Gibberish]

273
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:05,440
Enough child.

274
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:08,330

275
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:10,940

- No you should enjoy this

276
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:13,360

00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:14,880
No you stop it...

278
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,260
[Singing in Gibberish]

279
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,570
What's wrong with him?

280
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,650
Enough child...

281
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:26,920
Tell her to stop 
- you sang well child

282
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,290
Thanks

283
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:32,020
Dad another song.. 
- Enough, Stop it

284
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:35,440
Why did they act crazy

285
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:38,110
I want to talk with 
the girl in person

286
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:40,100
It's Ok go.

287
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:42,880
Go child, Show him the house.

288
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:49,300
Take this and practice.

289
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:51,570
Why should I practice this?

290
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:02,000
This is my third time

291
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:05,290
It's a first for me

292
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:07,470
Tea..

293
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:17,060
Oh! you came in shorts 
to see the bride

294
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:21,080
Actually, I sort of liked it.

295
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,150
I wanted to say something

296
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,600
What is it?

297
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,160
I smoke cigarette.

298
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:39,000
It’s OK

299
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:42,350
All cigarette smoking 
people aren't bad

300
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:45,690
Likewise, all people flaming 
incense sticks are not good

301
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:55,120
I drink liquor daily and 
my liver is also damaged

302
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,630
It's OK.

303
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,840
My teacher used to say...

304
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:02,880
According to chemistry 
Alcohol is a solution

305
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,810
Bloody teacher

306
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:12,000
I'm in a relationship 
with a girl

307
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,800
I'm OK with it.

308
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:18,460
It's good to have experience

309
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:21,750
More than that, 
when we go to buy a vehicle

310
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:24,370
Do we buy it straight away...

311
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:29,170
Don't we test drive 3-4 vehicles

312
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:31,390
Oh! they are already 
here!, Hello.

313
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:33,950
Sorry, I got delayed in 
commissioner’s office

314
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:36,120
He's My brother 
Alpesh Kumar

315
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:37,460
Had your coffee?

316
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:38,980
Hello

317
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:40,970
Hey! 
- Oh!!

318
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:44,040
Is he the Groom? 
- He's not a Man.

319
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:46,240
How many times should I say?

320
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:49,120
Groom is talking 
with Alpini upstairs

321
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,790
Oh! OK, 
So he's not the groom

322
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,880
I'll be back in a minute.

323
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:55,160
What is it?, Come inside.

324
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:57,870
Uncle, he will not 
reach home safely

325
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,630
Look, I'm not interested 
in this wedding

326
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,690
it's OK...

327
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:03,970
But why!?

328
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:06,790
The thing is, 
I should fall in love

329
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:09,700
I will marry only when I'm in love

330
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:11,070
Then love me.

331
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,320
No it should come from inside

332
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:15,460
Then make it...

333
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,870
No no...

334
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,770
Look, you are very 
cute and good looking

335
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,940
You will get a 
better groom than me.

336
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:24,270
Now listen, 
we'll go downstairs

337
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,910
I am not feeling it, 
you understand it right?

338
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:29,360
Now we'll go inside, 
you just sit quite. that's it

339
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,610
you understood it right 
- but the feel...

340
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:34,810
Thank you so much? 
- Alpini come here.

341
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:37,820
I'm coming - OK now come fast.

342
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:41,090
What is happening here?

343
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:43,940
He's here 
- Where?

344
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,130
Oh! you are the groom

345
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:51,220
I will be waiting in the car.

346
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,570
Should I wash the glass!?

347
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,370
OK then

348
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:57,470
We'll let you know 
what our opinion is

349
00:17:57,490 --> 00:17:58,430
OK.

350
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:02,090
If everything goes fine we'll 
finish the engagement very soon

351
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,840
Yes for sure.

352
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,570
Let's do as the elders said

353
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,180
wedding should be lawful, 
& rooms should be architectural

354
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:11,150
Stop it now 
- bye.

355
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:13,880
Why are you still sitting here?

356
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:15,790
See you soon.

357
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:17,970
What bullshit is this?

358
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:20,210
What kind of a son 
did you gave birth to?

359
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,880
He's rejecting such a good girl, 
What's wrong with him?

360
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,300
What is wrong with you?

361
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,560
Haven't you heard the saying...

362
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:28,870
A Man must be married and 
own a house in his lifetime

363
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:31,160
What was wrong with that girl? 
- Answer her

364
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:32,480
Open your mouth

365
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:35,080
Just because she 
sang few lines badly

366
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:36,450
How can you say no 
just for that?

367
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,990
after marriage, 
Will you guys join orchestra

368
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:40,580
Girl was beautiful right?

369
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,090
As if you are an handsome hunk?

370
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,130
So did you guys like the girl 
- yes

371
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,690
OK, then adopt her

372
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:47,720
Don't ask me to marry her

373
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:50,960
Oh my god! 
look how he's talking

374
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,720
He has all your traits...

375
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,950
Only your family 
argues like this

376
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:56,530
Hold it...

377
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:58,390
It's not our family trait

378
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:01,150
It's from your side, 
when my mom saw you...

379
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:03,160
She asked me, 
do really want this truculent

380
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:05,040
I was fooled by 
your fair beauty

381
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:07,560
Ok, blame me for everything

382
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:09,440
I have brought so many sarees

383
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:12,210
Not even a single saree 
has lost its color

384
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,500
I am an expert in 
selecting sarees

385
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,720
But I failed in 
selecting an husband

386
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:20,170
I'm living like a corpse 
after marring him.

387
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:22,950
Am I living like Power 
star Puneeth Rajkumar

388
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,710
Even I am living like a corpse

389
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,370
Look at him!!!

390
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,090
While we elders are 
fighting over him,

391
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:32,130
look at him sitting like a doll

392
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,070
Is there some coffee for me? 
- Come it's here.

393
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,710
Did you drink? 
- Yes.

394
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:41,160
Let me warm it 
- no it's fine

395
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:47,170
You live once and die once

396
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:49,530
Even love blooms only once

397
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:51,060
Go...

398
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:54,300
Express your love right now

399

And I am looking 
for a suitable groom

403
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:17,940
Who will never call 
me with a pet name

404
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:20,080
Guys should strictly 
remember that

405
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:23,300
He shouldn’t call me 
Pumpkin, Honey, Sugar

406
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,250
Or any other sweet name

407
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,860
Because, I am not a dessert

408
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:30,140
Which idiot calls people like that!

409
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:35,650
I am looking for someone 
with good Academic background

410
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:38,820
Clean shaved with a 
pleasant personality

411
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:41,800
Personality: Fair and Handsome

412
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:45,640
If Shah Rukh Khan 
was Software engineer

413
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,210
Even he would have 
an haunch back

414
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:50,410
Who is this Purple Priya?

415
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:53,360
Request Photo.

416
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:01,210
Why should I wait, 
till I get the Photo?

417
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:03,910
What if I copy her Mail ID 
and check in Facebook?

418
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:06,130
If she's in Facebook, 
I will find her

419
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,460
let's do it

420
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:22,950

Welcome Krishna

428
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:14,160

Welcome Krishna

437
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,910
I'm exited and psyched 
from this sweet sound

438
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:18,620
My Heart is pounding... 
I'm intoxicated for you

439
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:22,270
I'm exited and psyched 
from this sweet sound

440
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:26,560
My Heart is pounding... 
I'm intoxicated for you

441
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:31,230
Oh! dear... My dear....

442
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:33,090

Let's go for a ride 
in a Kawasaki bike

445
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:43,970

My heart is pounding hard...

450
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:05,250

Is to reach, 
Fifteen Million dollars.

483
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:35,500
As a team if we work together

484
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,370
Hi! 
- Hi?

485
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:40,200

486
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:43,270
I am talking about 
this High sir...

487
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:47,320
As a team we should focus and

488
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:49,220
concentrate a little better

489
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,010
Why no reply? bye.

490
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:52,760
Why no reply? bye.

491
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:54,900
Mr.Gubbi, 
what's happening here?

492
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:57,110
Sir... please call me Krissh

493
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:58,460
Whatever...

494
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,590
You just take a 
break and comeback

495
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:01,880
Thank you sir.

496
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:05,250
Look

497
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:06,970
I never send much

498
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:10,670
I sent so many stuff 
like a poet

499
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:14,410
But she ended the conversation 
with just three words

500
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,750
Dude...

501
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:19,660
You were not like this before.

502
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:22,740
You used to be 
in high spirits

503
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:25,570
Now you are so pale

504
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:28,540
like all ladies avoided me

505
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:31,000
They are avoiding you

506
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:33,520
If she was avoiding, 
why did she message me?

507
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:35,260
Idiot

508
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,400
We catch a fish with a bait

509
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:41,680
Guys realise about the 
fraudulence

510
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:44,290
only after they 
break-up with the girl

511
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:47,370
I knew about this 
in my third grade

512
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:50,890
When she stole my 
Apsara pencil from me

513
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:53,250
and refused to give it back

514
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,480
That is when I realised

515
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:58,390
All girls are frauds

516
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,800
Look

517
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,640
Promise me 
- Saying?

518
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:05,390
Saying, I will not 
talk to any girl

519
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,860
You are mad stop it 
- never see any girl...

520
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,720
Promise me that you will 
stay bachelor like me.

521
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,010
No I won't

522
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,800
Do You think you look 
like Shah Rukh Khan

523
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:17,820
You look like Bank 
Ganardhan's last brother

524
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,300
Don't say too much

525
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,080
Just promise me

526
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:23,780
will you be quite 
if I promise?

527
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:25,420
Ok, 
- I swear

528
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:27,000
He did it!

529
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:31,740
I'll be back, a messag... 
- What!

530
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:33,880
I will go to the washroom

531
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,420
Hello.

532
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:48,340
It's alright, 
I will teach you

533
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,470
It's not a problem 
- Sign sir

534
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:53,330
Here?

535
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:55,110
Hello sir. 
-Sit down

536
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:59,780
Ok Sir, I will call you later.

537
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:09,800
What is he looking at?

538
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,440
Are you looking at me? 
- Yes

539
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,630
Then it's fine

540
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,890
Nani, How are you.

541
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:21,700
Sir How can I be fine 
in a society where

542
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:23,920
People sell Ambode [Indian snack] as 
Masala Vada

543
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:28,450
Why are you always sad?

544
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:31,180
Why don't you stay 
happy like us?

545
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:34,330
Look, this universe is so vast

546
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:38,610
Everyone in this earth... 
- If everyone's happy in the universe?

547
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:41,050
Why do we cry, 
when we are born?

548
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,170
I can't change him

549
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:47,700
You are like a footwear

550
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:49,580
First you'll bite us

551
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,410
Later we'll like you

552
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,620
I would have been better 
if you had not praised me

553
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:57,040
but you compared me 
to a footwear

554
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:59,180
It hurt me a bit. 
I'll leave now

555
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,640
sit down

556
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:03,430
Sorry, I said it in the flow

557
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:07,460
Bring some tea...

558
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,150

562
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:19,800
Nani

563
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,890
Nobody should know 
that you came here

564
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,990
OK

565
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:27,210
Also...

566
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:29,990
You should only tell the truth

567
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:31,210
OK?

568
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:33,880

00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:35,290
Gubbi

570
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:36,720
How is he..

571
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:38,810
I mean... his character?

572
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:41,070
Like anything unpleasant to hear

573
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:45,930
Or any indecent stuff you see at 
Lal bhag or Cubbon park

574
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,330
You know what I mean?

575
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,720
Oh!, this Ia a 
background verification?

576
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,060
I said, there's something 
unbearable

577
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:53,920
What?

578
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:55,540
Anger

579
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:57,650
Everybody has that.

580
00:30:57,670 --> 00:30:59,980
Every hot blooded 
fellow has anger

581
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,420
Earlier even I had anger issues

582
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:03,080
Now its less, 
Did you know that?

583
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:05,820
Can you see anger? 
Can you see anger in my face?

584
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:07,590
No Sir. 
- Then...

585
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:10,160
It's not a problem.

586
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:14,410
Anything other than that, 
Something special?

587
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:17,010

00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:18,850

594
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:37,480

00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:07,410
And sits 24/7 in 
front of a Computer

622
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,010
Some part of the body 
has to be defective.

623
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,100
I knew it.

624
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,580
I was unaware that the 
main switch was defective

625
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:16,220
By saying the truth

626
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:18,470

What an Idea?

637
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:46,710

He'll repair it himself

638
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:48,240

How can you say no now,

647
00:34:18,410 --> 00:34:21,100

reputation in the society

00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,200
Shall I serve the breakfast? 
- NO.

649
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:32,230

650
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,510

00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:36,780
Drink some water.. 
- No, go pour it on yourself

652
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:38,100
Not for you.

653
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:44,060
What's the problem here?

654
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:49,360
My son is not the problem here.

00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:06,450

668
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:26,870

any problem...

00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,970
why did they 
cancel the wedding?

670
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:30,520

00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:45,870
I meant to say something, 
but I said something else.

728
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:53,410
I was going somewhere, 
But I came near you

729
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:12,670
Nowadays I spend more time 
in front of the mirror

730
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:18,660
Even there I see you, 
and go crazy

731
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:23,240
These sparkling eyes are 
advertisement of fantasy

732
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:28,910
Your words reached me 
even before you spoke

733
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:33,390
If this love blooms this way

734
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:36,480
What can I do Dear...

735
00:41:14,450 --> 00:41:19,890
Flowers from the tree lane are 
Changing into my hearts color

736
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:26,790
It would be beautiful if 
people understood our love

737
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:38,240
Shall I exhibit My 
feelings and pawn it

738
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:42,080
Without a hint

739
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:45,000
If this is happening 
in you also...

740
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,940
Please tell me how to survive it

741
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:09,940
Actually...

742
00:42:09,970 --> 00:42:12,230
Your Facebook profile 
is very interesting

743
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:15,090
It's nice. 
- My Facebook profile?

744
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,170
I have not posted any DP

745
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,300
Actually, that is what 
I found very interesting

746
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:21,690
it's very cute

747
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:24,600
Actually, I was in 
love with a guy

748
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:25,860
Nice

749
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,660
But later I dumped him

750
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:33,570
Actually, this is very nice.

751
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:35,370
Then I told my dad

752
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:38,500
Any groom I see next 
is the final one.

753
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:40,820
Was that the reason 
you finalized me?

754
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:41,950
Yes

755
00:42:42,370 --> 00:42:44,280
Then there is one more thing.

756
00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:47,860
I sent my friend 
Pink, as purple to you

757
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:50,220
But so sweet of you

758
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:51,830
You gave her a chocolate

759
00:42:51,850 --> 00:42:53,410
She grabbed it from me

760
00:42:53,850 --> 00:42:54,750
Sorry...

761
00:42:54,770 --> 00:42:57,060
A gift from me, take it

762
00:42:57,450 --> 00:42:59,050
So sweet of you..

763
00:42:59,070 --> 00:43:01,970
You brought me a purple doll, 
this is my favorite

764
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:03,550
Even I like it

765
00:43:03,570 --> 00:43:04,810
Chocolate...

766
00:43:04,830 --> 00:43:07,080
It has melted a 
bit from the heat

767
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:08,560
Adjust a bit.

768
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:10,590
I'll buy a new one 
- Ok

769
00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:14,760
Look, Bring your parents 
to My home tomorrow itself

770
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:17,600
For wedding? 
- yes

771
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:18,440
OK

772
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:20,080
I have no other conditions

773
00:43:20,110 --> 00:43:22,190
But I have only one condition 
- What is it?

774
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:25,070
I have no problem with 
staying separate from parents

775
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:28,660
That's completely fine with me.

776
00:43:41,070 --> 00:43:43,670
Hello 
- Nani, How are you?

777
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:47,700
They keep a Vada 
between two buns

778
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:49,550
and sell it in the 
name of burger.

779
00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:51,410
How can I be happy 
in this society

780
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:52,730
Look...

781
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:55,040
Don't spoil my mood by 
saying anything bad,

782
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:56,490
I am very happy

783
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:59,040
I want to tell you 
an important thing

784
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:00,620
It's a Happy news

785
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,630
First You tell me what it is

786
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:04,950
I will decide whether 
it's good or bad

787
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:06,230
The thing is...

788
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:09,990
Even you used to say, 
I won't get a beautiful girl

789
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:11,760
Today a girl proposed me

790
00:44:11,790 --> 00:44:13,530
If I say how she is...

791
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,480
You have to wash your 
hands before you touch her.

792
00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:16,710
She's so beautiful

793
00:44:16,730 --> 00:44:18,740
What are you saying?

794
00:44:18,770 --> 00:44:20,930
Wash hands before touching her,

795
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,550
Did you propose to an infant?

796
00:44:23,570 --> 00:44:25,990
It's not that, not an infant

797
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:27,430
But she is as 
beautiful as an infant

798
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:28,720
And the other thing is...

799
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:30,620
Her house is... 
Three roads after my house

800
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,770
there is a beauty parlor

801
00:44:32,890 --> 00:44:35,110
Did you get it? 
There is a huge gate.

802
00:44:40,570 --> 00:44:42,900
Whom do you want?

803
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:44,570
Purple Priya's house?

804
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:45,920
This is it, and you are?

805
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:48,110
Groom... 
- Oh! I was waiting for you.

806
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:50,670
Come, Come...

807
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:53,150
Slowdown

808
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:54,770
Why are you dragging me,

809
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,200
calm down 
- OK sit down

810
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:02,960
Why is he like this?

811
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:05,750
Is he the guy my 
daughter selected?

812
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:07,950
Shit!

813
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:11,630
My daughter said 
you'll be here by 10:30

814
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:14,400
Till then I'll go sit in 
cemetery and come back

815
00:45:14,430 --> 00:45:15,530
Oh!

816
00:45:15,870 --> 00:45:17,830
You said such a 
inauspicious thing

817
00:45:17,850 --> 00:45:19,700
Say sorry 
- Sorry

818
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:22,980
What will you like to drink? 
- Some poison

819
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:25,520
See, again same 
inauspicious words

820
00:45:25,710 --> 00:45:28,520
Once again, say sorry 
- again sorry

821
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:31,780
I meant will you drink 
coffee or tea?

822
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:34,380
Get me some coffee

823
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:36,390
Bring some coffee

824
00:45:36,410 --> 00:45:37,790
Ok Sir.

825
00:45:39,910 --> 00:45:42,730
My daughter was 
raised motherless

826
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,960
So I have raised her 
with lot of pampering

827
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:48,810
I never said no her

828
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:51,430
Now she said, 
I love someone

829
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:53,110
This is not our time

830
00:45:53,130 --> 00:45:57,920
In our time, we were not aware 
of falling behind girls or love

831
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:02,080
The thing is after the invention 
of Facebook and watsapp

832
00:46:02,110 --> 00:46:04,180
Everybody is a Kosher

833
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:08,780
What are you looking for?

834
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,340
It's our own house

835
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:11,470
No.. 
- Yes.

836
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:13,710
No, I meant coffee's not here

837
00:46:13,730 --> 00:46:16,510
Oh!, its on the way. 
come fast

838
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:19,060
I'm coming sir, 
I was cooking upma

839
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:20,510
that's the reason for delay

840
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:22,170
OK serve it.

841
00:46:30,410 --> 00:46:31,710
What happened?

842
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:34,060
Coffee is too strong.

843
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:36,960
Brew fresh coffee and bring it.

844
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:38,910
Bring it Hot.

845
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:42,660
While she comes 
back eat the upma

846
00:46:48,190 --> 00:46:49,690
Is it bitter?

847
00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:52,280
Stone, Rava is not 
roasted well

848
00:46:52,450 --> 00:46:54,270
I think she has roasted like this.

849
00:46:54,290 --> 00:46:56,300
It should be roasted like this.

850
00:46:56,370 --> 00:46:59,370
More than that, 
seasoning has burnt

851
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:03,670
My mouth became bitter

852
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:06,450
Look, I don't want this marriage

853
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:10,380
Does anybody reject a marriage, 
Just because Upma is bad?

854
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,630
You don't get it

855
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:15,440
We agreed for it only 
after you agreed

856
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:16,570
Don't force me.

857
00:47:16,590 --> 00:47:18,240
I once wrote a erotic poem

858
00:47:18,270 --> 00:47:21,650
about not getting into a 
bus, Hall or bed by force

859
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:24,200
I think people of your 
age have not read it

860
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:26,710
Bye. 
- One minute listen to me

861
00:47:26,970 --> 00:47:29,700
Coffee's here, have some. 
We'll talk later

862
00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:38,650
What happened? 
- Same coffee

863
00:47:38,770 --> 00:47:41,070
She has warmed 
that cold coffee

864
00:47:41,090 --> 00:47:43,220
Its still bitter

865
00:47:43,250 --> 00:47:45,570
Listen, I will tell you 
something

866
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:50,610
Never hit on top of the filter, 
to get the dicoction fast

867
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:53,120
That is when it gets 
bitter, bye.

868
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:56,080
Fire her from the job

869
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:57,710
She doesn't know anything

870
00:47:57,730 --> 00:47:59,980
Such idiots...

871
00:48:00,150 --> 00:48:01,760
You have worn a nice saree today

872
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:04,290
It's Priya, Purple Priya 
- Speak to her

873
00:48:05,770 --> 00:48:06,910
Priya tell me.

874
00:48:06,930 --> 00:48:10,070
How can you cancel our wedding

875
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:12,640
I agreed to marry you on pity

876
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:14,770
But you are Shaming me

877
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,780
Don't speak 
- But I...

878
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:20,870
You don't even have enough hair to 
comb, While I tie my hair.

879
00:48:21,010 --> 00:48:22,870
who are you to say the 
wedding is canceled

880
00:48:22,890 --> 00:48:24,910
I'm telling you, this 
wedding is canceled

881
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:26,610
From now on, 
Don't call me or message me

882
00:48:26,630 --> 00:48:28,600
But Priya 
- I don't like you

883
00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:31,640
I don't want you. And I don't want to 
see your face ever again, good bye.

884
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:34,910
If I ever get a call from 
you, I'll teach you a lesson

885
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:39,550
what happened

886
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:41,460
Sir Shall I move?

887
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:43,750
Turn off the car.

888
00:48:43,810 --> 00:48:45,540
Sir what happened?

889
00:48:45,570 --> 00:48:46,750
Gubbi...

890
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:49,390
Even this...

891
00:48:49,410 --> 00:48:50,420
That's it

892
00:48:50,450 --> 00:48:52,270
I knew about this

893
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:54,810
This is some Sage's 
curse, causing us all this

894
00:48:54,830 --> 00:48:56,060
You don't cry now, stop it

895
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:57,340
Tell me sir what happened

896
00:48:57,370 --> 00:48:58,250
You shut-up

897
00:48:58,270 --> 00:49:01,370
In everyone's house dosa has holes. 
In our house even Dumplings has holes

898
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:02,710
He's adding ghee to the fire.

899
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:05,030
Come let's go. 
Everybody get down

900
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:21,950
Aunty how are you? 
- I'm fine.

901
00:49:21,970 --> 00:49:24,900
Take some 
- No, I don't want it

902
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:30,500
How many of you are coming 
- have some...

903
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:32,280
No I've had enough

904
00:49:32,790 --> 00:49:34,160
Go now

905
00:49:45,670 --> 00:49:46,890
Gubbi

906
00:49:47,190 --> 00:49:48,480
Gubbi

907
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:51,030
When is your marriage?

908
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:53,810
What's your age? 
- Eighteen

909
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:55,540
How much 
- Eighteen

910
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:57,630
What are you studying? 
- Engineering

911
00:49:58,230 --> 00:49:59,390
Take this 5 rupees

912
00:49:59,410 --> 00:50:01,460
Now go eat a candy

913
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:03,380
We'll about marriage later

914
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:11,080
Gubbi what is this?

915
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:14,150
Even children are 
questioning you

916
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:18,010
When will you get married?

917
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:42,680
Gubbi, when is your marriage?

918
00:50:44,170 --> 00:50:45,430
What's your problem?

919
00:50:45,650 --> 00:50:47,660
I'm asking seriously 
what's your problem

920
00:50:47,690 --> 00:50:50,220
Have I ever come to you 
saying, I will not marry

921
00:50:50,250 --> 00:50:52,560
I am asking everybody, 
what's your problem?

922
00:50:54,150 --> 00:50:56,760
They say all love stories 
are born in the hospitals

923
00:50:56,790 --> 00:50:58,770
A cute infant boy 
will be sleeping.

924
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:02,690
Next to it they bring a beautiful 
baby girl and put her to sleep

925
00:51:03,350 --> 00:51:05,320
There, love blossoms a bit

926
00:51:05,550 --> 00:51:08,000
But I was born Via home delivery

927
00:51:08,030 --> 00:51:09,740
Was it my fault?

928
00:51:09,770 --> 00:51:11,810
I am asking you, is it my fault. 
It's not right?

929
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:13,230
They joined me to the school.

930
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:14,870
They made us take pledge

931
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:17,790
All Indians are my 
brothers and sisters

932
00:51:18,170 --> 00:51:20,040
I'm Ok with brothers

933
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:21,610
But sisters?

934
00:51:22,770 --> 00:51:26,080
In everyone's life, that 
pledge has been broken

935
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:28,010
But in my life, it 
has become a thorn

936
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:29,160
is it my fault?

937
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:31,000
Answer me...

938
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:33,950
While I was going to college,

939
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:36,250
you said study well 
you'll a beautiful girl

940
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:38,930
I believed you and spent 
time in the library

941
00:51:39,530 --> 00:51:41,260
After graduating from 
college I realised

942
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,350
Girls were partying 
in the canteen

943
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:45,510
You taught me and 
this is your fault

944
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:49,100
On a valentine day, 
I sent her a message saying "Hi"

945
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,950
I got a reply on 
Raksha Bandhan

946
00:51:51,970 --> 00:51:53,660
She said she was busy.

947
00:51:53,850 --> 00:51:55,450
This is my fault right?

948
00:51:56,250 --> 00:51:58,030
While working in the MNC

949
00:51:58,060 --> 00:52:01,040
I thought, I'll catch a high 
profile girl and marry her

950
00:52:01,070 --> 00:52:02,730
But even before me

951
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:05,300
they were running behind 
the Manager with a bucket

952
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:07,700
Just like you were running 
behind us with a bowl

953
00:52:09,330 --> 00:52:11,040
I said f*ck it

954
00:52:11,110 --> 00:52:12,900
I wandered all the markets

955
00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:14,740
Looking for a middle class girl

956
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:19,090
Girls are not coming out 
even to buy curry leaves

957
00:52:19,230 --> 00:52:21,050
They say online shopping.

958
00:52:21,070 --> 00:52:22,860
This is our fault right?

959
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:26,510
If you have a good bike 
with some hair on the head

960
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:28,670
Girls fall in line

961
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:31,050
They chat if you flirt

962
00:52:31,370 --> 00:52:33,260
But for people like us

963
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:37,320
They say, You will get 
a better girl than me.

964
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:41,160
If we try to warn her

965
00:52:41,190 --> 00:52:43,940
Saying he has three 
girlfriends, they shut us

966
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:46,060
by saying, he has a good 
heart and I have seen it.

967
00:52:46,090 --> 00:52:49,090
As if they roam around 
with an X-ray machine.

968
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:50,650
They see heart...

969
00:52:52,730 --> 00:52:55,730
They say law of the 
universe is change

970
00:52:55,850 --> 00:52:58,870
I think, mostly they brought 
me from another universe

971
00:52:59,470 --> 00:53:01,050
There is no change

972
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:04,870
I was single, when I 
came out of my mother

973
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:08,360
Now my stomach is quite big, 
even now I am single

974
00:53:09,670 --> 00:53:11,990
Shit!, 
why am I talking to you guys?

975
00:53:12,010 --> 00:53:14,460
Still so much food is 
left, eat well.

976
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:16,450
Don't waste anything

977
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:18,320
You have roasted me well

978
00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:19,360
I remembered Someone,

979
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:21,250
I will comeback after 
talking to her

980
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:22,280
Eat

981
00:53:28,450 --> 00:53:29,870
Who is it? 
- Krissh

982
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:32,140
We don't need any dish, 
we have it already

983
00:53:32,870 --> 00:53:34,290
Krissh is my name

984
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:36,740
Hey Baldy...

985
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:38,220
Did I come here that day?

986
00:53:38,530 --> 00:53:41,380
I asked, 
did I come here that day

987
00:53:41,540 --> 00:53:42,670
No

988
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:45,250
Go bark that 
to your daughter.

989
00:53:45,270 --> 00:53:46,400
Ok

990
00:53:47,630 --> 00:53:50,490
Telling her is enough right, 
Why bark?

991
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:52,450
Ok do that.

992
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:56,070
Ok, But why should I tell my 
daughter that you were not here

993
00:53:56,090 --> 00:53:57,150
Because...

994
00:53:57,180 --> 00:53:59,080
She thinks I was here

995
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:00,420
No she won't think like that

996
00:54:00,450 --> 00:54:02,980
Look if you were here, 
she'll know you were here

997
00:54:03,010 --> 00:54:04,890
If not, she'll think 
the other way around

998
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:06,020
If you were not here,

999
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:07,500
Why will she think 
you were here

1000
00:54:07,530 --> 00:54:09,440
She called me herself 
and said it.

1001
00:54:09,470 --> 00:54:11,370
She thinks I was here, 
please tell her

1002
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:12,740
Is that it? 
- That's it

1003
00:54:12,770 --> 00:54:14,700
You could have said this before.

1004
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:16,850
Such a nonsense fellow

1005
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:19,780
Priya, 
- Yes dad.

1006
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:22,520
Oh!

1007
00:54:22,540 --> 00:54:24,430
Dad, why is he here?

1008
00:54:24,450 --> 00:54:27,290
The thing is, He was 
not here that day

1009
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:31,390
Now he's here to say, 
I did not come here that day

1010
00:54:31,410 --> 00:54:33,150
I told her, 
are you OK with it?

1011
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:34,380
Now go

1012
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,540
Krissh you may go 
- One minute

1013
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:39,160
Did I come here and tell 
you I don't want this girl?

1014
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:40,470
No.

1015
00:54:40,490 --> 00:54:42,420
That day he did not come here

1016
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:43,560
It was another guy

1017
00:54:43,590 --> 00:54:45,910
Yes Madam, 
That day, he was not here

1018
00:54:45,940 --> 00:54:48,050
It was other guy 
with squint eyes

1019
00:54:48,070 --> 00:54:50,940
Though I brewed coffee 
twice, he said it was bitter

1020
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:53,980
More than that, 
He preaches me on how to cook upma

1021
00:54:54,010 --> 00:54:55,040
Yes child

1022
00:54:55,060 --> 00:54:56,700
Ask this guy...

1023
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:58,500
Krissh! he's my Dad

1024
00:54:58,530 --> 00:55:00,650
I meant ask your dad...

1025
00:55:00,670 --> 00:55:02,070
its Ok

1026
00:55:02,250 --> 00:55:03,420
So...

1027
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:05,730
That day he was supposed to be here 
- Yes

1028
00:55:05,750 --> 00:55:08,040
But the guy who came 
here was different

1029
00:55:08,070 --> 00:55:10,490
But somebody was here

1030
00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:12,300
So...

1031
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:13,760
Is he the guy?

1032
00:55:13,790 --> 00:55:15,820
Yes sir, bless me

1033
00:55:15,850 --> 00:55:16,970
God bless you

1034
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:19,430
Nice beard. 
- Thank you

1035
00:55:20,090 --> 00:55:22,500
You do one thing.

1036
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:26,130
Tomorrow come here 
with your parents

1037
00:55:26,230 --> 00:55:28,030
Let's finish the engagement

1038
00:55:28,110 --> 00:55:29,660
If we delay it...

1039
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:33,280
Some guy other than you... 
- No, No, No

1040
00:55:33,350 --> 00:55:35,510
You take care

1041
00:55:36,830 --> 00:55:38,650
Hi 
- Hi

1042
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,280
But you did not believe me

1043
00:55:49,530 --> 00:55:51,500
Sorry Krissh

1044
00:55:52,070 --> 00:55:54,440
It's Ok

1045
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:56,030
But...

1046
00:55:56,060 --> 00:56:00,070
Somebody is trying 
to spoil our Love

1047
00:56:03,870 --> 00:56:05,720
That squint eyed guy.

1048
00:56:05,750 --> 00:56:07,980
You keep a straight eye on him

1049
00:56:08,010 --> 00:56:09,780
Squint eyed guy right?

1050
00:56:34,710 --> 00:56:36,360
Oh! Donk seena is here...

1051
00:56:36,390 --> 00:56:38,490
He was the one who 
murdered seven people

1052
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:39,850
Close your doors

1053
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:44,750
[People murmuring]

1054
00:56:44,770 --> 00:56:46,570
It's Somebody's last day alive

1055
00:56:46,590 --> 00:56:53,780
[People Murmuring]

1056
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:07,310
Why are holding 
such useless stuff

1057
00:57:07,580 --> 00:57:10,180
Uncle where is Nani?

1058
00:57:10,270 --> 00:57:12,040
What can I say about his misery

1059
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:13,320
See for yourself

1061
00:57:16,610 --> 00:57:18,390
Gubbi

1062
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,430
Finally you came

1063
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:22,010
Slowly...

1064
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:26,190
What's wrong with you?

1065
00:57:27,140 --> 00:57:28,510
Sinner...

1066
00:57:29,450 --> 00:57:32,350
Why did you put Loose 
motion tablets...

1067
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:35,350
in the poison bottle?

1068
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:38,420
I took all of them 
without knowledge

1069
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:42,880
I went 24 times...

1070
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:45,260
Stop with your detailing

1071
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:47,690
I came here to tell 
you an important matter

00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:51,070

Me and purple again

1073

Don't go up or down

1076

Did you come here to tell that?

1077
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:59,930
Yes, who comes so far to see you

1078

Take care

1079
00:58:02,350 --> 00:58:04,980
And firstly remove these 
shitty poems you wrote

00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:19,770
Rukmini, Gubbi 
- I'm coming

1084
00:58:19,790 --> 00:58:22,770

You think and explain it to me

1112
01:00:19,580 --> 01:00:23,700
Thing is, Will I kidnap the 
girl I am supposed to marry?

1113
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:25,630
This is going wrong

1114
01:00:25,650 --> 01:00:27,950
Are you playing games with me? 
- No sir...

1115
01:00:27,980 --> 01:00:30,330

1119
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:39,330
You shouldn’t scold 
a grown-up son

1120
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:42,450
Call him Krissh and sit down, 
I will talk to you later

1126
01:00:54,530 --> 01:00:55,940

1127
01:00:56,170 --> 01:00:57,610

1133
01:01:09,810 --> 01:01:11,130
I should tell...

1134
01:01:11,750 --> 01:01:14,350
Or else she will feel bad.

1135
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:21,610
I will go there and text...

1136
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:24,300
Madam where is 
house number 13?

1137
01:01:24,510 --> 01:01:27,070

1138
01:01:28,020 --> 01:01:29,710
who are you guys,

1139
01:01:29,730 --> 01:01:31,660
Why are you kidnapping me?

1140
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:34,040
Oh! even you are here..

1141
01:01:34,060 --> 01:01:35,870
Today it's her, 
tomorrow its your turn

1142
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:37,380
and then your Gubbi.

1143
01:01:37,410 --> 01:01:39,530
Move fast 
- Stop...

1144
01:01:44,430 --> 01:01:46,150
They kidnapped her!

1145
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:49,460
Who's help shall I seek.

1146
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:57,240
Nani...

1147
01:01:57,260 --> 01:01:59,420
Karnataka has only one Rajkumar

1148
01:01:59,450 --> 01:02:01,960
Police station has only Sai Kumar

1149
01:02:01,980 --> 01:02:04,560
The one man who will always 
help you, is Alpesh Kumar

1150
01:02:04,590 --> 01:02:05,800
Come

1151
01:02:08,450 --> 01:02:09,980
Why did I tell him that!?

1152
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,430
Sir, today is 
My son's engagement

1153
01:02:12,750 --> 01:02:15,070
After many years. 
He finally got a bride

1154
01:02:15,100 --> 01:02:16,380
Now we should 
finish the wedding

1155
01:02:16,410 --> 01:02:18,490
If we leave another year 
- He will get wasted

1156
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:19,660
Not that sir... 
- then

1157
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:22,040
If we get him married when 
he doesn't have Guru's strength

1158
01:02:22,070 --> 01:02:23,440
They say he'll not live long

1159
01:02:23,460 --> 01:02:26,090
You don't need Guru's 
strength for marriage

1160
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:27,420
You need strength

1161
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:29,050
Nani, It's a 
problem right?

1162
01:02:29,070 --> 01:02:30,990
You sort of impressed me

1163
01:02:31,020 --> 01:02:32,890
What? 
- Look

1164
01:02:33,260 --> 01:02:36,400
Though the tablets are expired, 
you have still kept it for sale

1165
01:02:36,430 --> 01:02:37,870
I am happy for you

1166
01:02:37,900 --> 01:02:40,090
It's a problem you 
can't talk about.

1167
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:41,430
Yes sir, it's a problem

1168
01:02:41,450 --> 01:02:43,800
I don't know why, 
all the trouble finds me?

1169
01:02:43,830 --> 01:02:45,390
It's an internal problem

1170
01:02:45,410 --> 01:02:47,440
You can't see it outside

1171
01:02:47,470 --> 01:02:49,900
Why does he keep asking me?

1172
01:02:51,660 --> 01:02:53,900

1173
01:02:53,930 --> 01:02:55,690

1174
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:57,300

OK I will pass it to 
him, take it

1186
01:03:18,570 --> 01:03:20,660
How does he know I'm here? 
- I don't know

1187
01:03:20,690 --> 01:03:24,820
Hello 
- Hello

1188
01:03:25,150 --> 01:03:27,260
Robin hoooood

1189
01:03:28,180 --> 01:03:29,980
Sir!

1190
01:03:30,230 --> 01:03:32,860
Did you remember me?

1191
01:03:32,890 --> 01:03:34,590
Now look

1192
01:03:34,620 --> 01:03:38,780
The girl you love, 
Purple is with me.

1193
01:03:39,050 --> 01:03:41,520
If you want her alive

1194
01:03:41,550 --> 01:03:44,720
Don't inform the 
police And come alone,

1195
01:03:44,740 --> 01:03:45,830
Do you know where?

1196
01:03:45,860 --> 01:03:46,930
He's talking a lot

1197
01:03:46,970 --> 01:03:48,660
You should come to.. 
- where sir?

1198
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:50,330
Shall I tell? 
- yes sir, one second

1199
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:51,400
I won't...

1200
01:03:51,420 --> 01:03:54,150
If you don't 
say, where do I go

1201
01:03:55,210 --> 01:03:59,380
You stole a bike 
that robin hood stole

1202
01:03:59,620 --> 01:04:02,210
It's not hard for you to find me

1203
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:04,810
But remember one thing...

1204
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:06,520
If you want to enter my fort

1205
01:04:06,550 --> 01:04:08,510
You have to say this code

1206
01:04:08,530 --> 01:04:10,290
The code is...

1207
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:12,300
I am an idiot

1208
01:04:12,510 --> 01:04:13,690
Yes...

1209
01:04:13,710 --> 01:04:15,430
I am an idiot

1210
01:04:15,510 --> 01:04:17,240
This is your code.

1211
01:04:17,270 --> 01:04:19,090
If you forget this code

1212
01:04:19,110 --> 01:04:21,180
it's equivalent to 
forgetting your purple

1213
01:04:21,220 --> 01:04:23,220
You know the code right?

1214
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:24,920
Yes sir.

1215
01:04:26,260 --> 01:04:28,970
Robin hoooood

1216
01:04:32,300 --> 01:04:33,440
What is it?

1217
01:04:33,470 --> 01:04:34,670
I am an Idiot

1218
01:04:34,690 --> 01:04:36,750
I know that, 
what did he say?

1219
01:04:36,770 --> 01:04:39,210
Sir 15 days back...

1220
01:04:39,230 --> 01:04:40,590
Little bit

1221
01:04:40,850 --> 01:04:42,240
is it enough? 
yes

1222
01:04:42,260 --> 01:04:43,380
it gets stained

1223
01:04:43,810 --> 01:04:44,960
What is that? 
- turmeric

1224
01:04:44,990 --> 01:04:46,460
Put it here

1225
01:04:50,990 --> 01:04:52,280
give it to me.

1226
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:58,540
White bike, its hard to wash

1227
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:02,370
Do we have to crack coconut? 
- yes

1228
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:03,850
Do that a bit far from here

1229
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:05,350
If it hits the bike

1230
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:07,570
Just a safety precaution

1231
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:14,430
Nani keep an eye.

1232
01:05:18,980 --> 01:05:20,580
Take this

1233
01:05:22,090 --> 01:05:23,220
God bless you

1234
01:05:23,460 --> 01:05:24,560
Offerings?

1235
01:05:24,590 --> 01:05:26,930
For what? let it be.

1236
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:20,610
Why did you take so long?

1237
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:22,220
I brought a new bike so...

1238
01:06:22,420 --> 01:06:25,200
First time in my life... 
- Where

1239
01:06:27,850 --> 01:06:28,950
Where is the bike?

1240
01:06:30,100 --> 01:06:31,580
He took it.

1241
01:06:31,610 --> 01:06:32,960
Who took it?

1242
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:35,470
Thief 
- what were you doing?

1243
01:06:36,590 --> 01:06:37,960
I was feeling sad

1244
01:06:37,980 --> 01:06:39,820
Why didn't you call me?

1245
01:06:44,130 --> 01:06:45,640
He gave this and took it

1246
01:06:45,670 --> 01:06:47,670
Idiot,which side did he go 
with the bike?

1247
01:06:48,210 --> 01:06:50,020
This side 
- come lets go

1248
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:51,090
God!

1249
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:52,380
Come fast

1250
01:06:58,050 --> 01:06:59,580
Did you see

1251
01:06:59,900 --> 01:07:01,580
No I did not 
- To say that...

1252
01:07:06,490 --> 01:07:09,010
You eat the banana, come

1253
01:07:13,430 --> 01:07:16,120
Sir... This bike is mine

1254
01:07:16,150 --> 01:07:18,190
I won't give it get lost

1255
01:07:18,220 --> 01:07:20,930
Come this side, 
Sir, We'll block it.

1256
01:07:21,730 --> 01:07:23,540
Step aside 
- No

1257
01:07:23,700 --> 01:07:26,110
We don't get afraid 
if you start the bike

1258
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:29,180
I won't get afraid even 
if you make a moving sound

1259
01:07:31,540 --> 01:07:33,900
He is turning that side.

1260
01:07:38,540 --> 01:07:39,740
Nani look..

1261
01:07:39,770 --> 01:07:41,040
Look this side

1262
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:44,500
This is a very big 
challenge in our life

1263
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:46,450
By any means

1264
01:07:46,470 --> 01:07:48,830
we have to steal the 
bike, they stole from us

1265
01:07:49,740 --> 01:07:52,770
Now what I am doing is, 
I'm following him everyday

1266
01:07:52,790 --> 01:07:55,430
I know what he does 
at any point of time

1267
01:07:55,930 --> 01:07:56,990
Look

1268
01:07:57,350 --> 01:07:58,730
He comes on Monday

1269
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:01,430
Drinks coffee in the tea shop

1270
01:08:02,310 --> 01:08:03,410
Smokes a cigarette

1271
01:08:04,250 --> 01:08:05,530
Gives him the money

1272
01:08:05,550 --> 01:08:07,680
Then takes the bike and drives away

1273
01:08:07,870 --> 01:08:09,430
He comes on Tuesday

1274
01:08:09,870 --> 01:08:11,560
Drinks coffee in the tea shop

1275
01:08:11,690 --> 01:08:13,060
Smokes a cigarette

1276
01:08:13,260 --> 01:08:14,560
Gives him the money

1277
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:16,810
takes the bike and drives away

1278
01:08:18,100 --> 01:08:20,420
Then he comes on Wednesday 
- does he repeat those things

1279
01:08:20,440 --> 01:08:22,250
Yes he repeats it 
- go forward

1280
01:08:23,750 --> 01:08:24,820
Look...

1281
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:26,780
If we want to do anything

1282
01:08:26,930 --> 01:08:28,430
That is our time

1283
01:08:30,970 --> 01:08:32,570
What do we do?

1284
01:08:33,970 --> 01:08:35,970
Even I don't know what to do

1285
01:08:36,710 --> 01:08:38,900
We have to do something...

1286
01:08:47,420 --> 01:08:49,560
you brought this 
bike with cash right?

1287
01:08:49,590 --> 01:08:51,250
I paid full cash.

1288
01:08:52,350 --> 01:08:53,750
Other key?

1289
01:08:53,770 --> 01:08:55,870
Mother has kept it in the 
Locker, we have it.

1290
01:08:58,260 --> 01:09:00,540
Go start the bike and bring it

1291
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:19,580
Well done 
- Why sir?

1292
01:09:19,610 --> 01:09:22,670
You did all this with 
40kgs of body weight,

1293
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:24,690
Sir now it's 43 
- did you gain weight?

1294
01:09:24,710 --> 01:09:26,070
Diet.

1295
01:09:27,490 --> 01:09:29,730
What did he say in the phone?

1296
01:09:30,290 --> 01:09:32,070
Come near sir...

1297
01:09:32,820 --> 01:09:35,870
He said he has 
kidnapped Purple Priya

1298
01:09:36,550 --> 01:09:39,350
He gave me a code, 
saying don't reveal it to anybody

1299
01:09:39,430 --> 01:09:41,260
He said don't inform the police

1300
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:42,970
We don't have to inform 
them, sir?

1301
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,870
There is no need of it now 
- that is what I thought sir

1302
01:09:47,140 --> 01:09:49,810
Sir!, even you are a police..

1303
01:09:49,830 --> 01:09:51,810
I said it in a flow, sorry

1304
01:09:52,330 --> 01:09:55,050
Who is this Idiot fellow

1305
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:58,330
I've heard of lightning 
striking the head

1306
01:09:58,350 --> 01:10:00,580
lightning has 
struck his brain

1307
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:04,000
He makes a call to police 
station and says not inform them

1308
01:10:04,020 --> 01:10:06,350
Sir, he might be 
having some problem

1309
01:10:06,380 --> 01:10:08,820
Everybody has some sort 
of problems - yes sir

1310
01:10:09,370 --> 01:10:11,360
What was the code?

1311
01:10:11,990 --> 01:10:13,000
Sir...

1312
01:10:13,030 --> 01:10:14,620
It's Ok, say what is it?

1313
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:16,650
I am an Idiot

1314
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:27,830
Excuse me 
- who is it?

1315
01:10:27,850 --> 01:10:30,330
Hello sir, 
I am an Idiot

1316
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,270
What is it?

1317
01:10:35,170 --> 01:10:37,720
What do you want? 
- Idiot is here sir

1318
01:10:38,050 --> 01:10:40,460
Oh! Idiot, come inside

1319
01:10:54,730 --> 01:10:56,070
Sir it's a nice place

1320
01:10:56,100 --> 01:10:59,000
He's sitting on top of it, 
It's a nice spot...

1321
01:10:59,140 --> 01:11:00,900
Sir do you sell Vehicles?

1322
01:11:03,390 --> 01:11:04,770
Where is the boss?

1323
01:11:05,090 --> 01:11:07,530
Robin hoooood

1324
01:11:09,340 --> 01:11:10,520
Sir I can't see you...

1325
01:11:10,540 --> 01:11:12,730
Can you see, where is the Boss?

1326
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:14,370
Where is he?

1327
01:11:15,340 --> 01:11:17,240
Sir, Can you see?

1328
01:11:18,420 --> 01:11:19,580
You can't.

1329
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:21,350
Sir I can't see you

1330
01:11:21,380 --> 01:11:22,570
If you come outside

1331
01:11:22,590 --> 01:11:25,420
It's others era only till I arrive

1332
01:11:25,450 --> 01:11:27,080
I know this...

1333
01:11:27,110 --> 01:11:29,950
After you arrive its your era. 
This is from the movie Ramachari

1334
01:11:29,970 --> 01:11:32,510
It's a nice movie, 
I have seen it thrice

1335
01:11:32,530 --> 01:11:35,560
In the end, there's a Scooter scene 
Between Father-Son, its so emotional.

1336
01:11:35,580 --> 01:11:37,920
I could not control 
it, Sir I cried a lot.

1337
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:39,350
Why?

1338
01:12:23,970 --> 01:12:25,720
Welcome Gubbi, Welcome

1339
01:12:25,750 --> 01:12:27,870
Sir, please call me Krissh.

1340
01:12:27,890 --> 01:12:29,510
What's in the Name

1341
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:34,710
If we don't call rose as rose

1342
01:12:34,740 --> 01:12:36,880
It's scent won't change

1343
01:12:37,580 --> 01:12:39,680
Our Balanna used to say this

1344
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:42,020
Sir actually, 
Shakespeare said it

1345
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:43,090
May be

1346
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:45,120
But Balanna told me

1347
01:12:45,150 --> 01:12:46,840
OK, May be

1348
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:52,830
You stole a bike that 
Robin hood's gang robbed

1349
01:12:53,450 --> 01:12:55,330
I appreciate your talent

1350
01:12:58,580 --> 01:13:00,340
Thank you sir, 
He gave it to me

1351
01:13:00,370 --> 01:13:01,760
I will come to the 
matter directly

1352
01:13:01,790 --> 01:13:02,930
yes sir

1353
01:13:02,950 --> 01:13:04,950
You should do a job for me

1354
01:13:05,300 --> 01:13:06,370
What is it sir?

1355
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:11,170
If you go one KM further 
from the Kengeri Flyover

1356
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:14,210
On the left there is a 
Gramina Pragathi bank

1357
01:13:14,230 --> 01:13:15,250
OK

1358
01:13:15,820 --> 01:13:17,230
Go to that ATM...

1359
01:13:17,260 --> 01:13:19,980
Should I withdraw cash for 
you sir, give me the ATM card

1360
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,940
You should...

1361
01:13:22,020 --> 01:13:24,030
Steal that ATM van 
- Sir!

1362
01:13:24,820 --> 01:13:27,210
Should I do the robbery? 
- Exactly

1363
01:13:27,710 --> 01:13:29,010
Sir it's will be hard

1364
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:31,480
If not for you

1365
01:13:32,020 --> 01:13:34,160
You will do this job 
for your love

1366
01:13:34,180 --> 01:13:37,510
Sir you are such a huge Don, 
sparks fly when you walk

1367
01:13:37,540 --> 01:13:39,580
Sir You can do it yourself.

1368
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:42,900
I Could

1369
01:13:43,410 --> 01:13:44,720
But...

1370
01:13:45,330 --> 01:13:47,220
Recently our guys...

1371
01:13:47,250 --> 01:13:49,480
While waging a war 
with the opposite gang

1372
01:13:50,170 --> 01:13:52,170
Killed some unknown guy

1373
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:53,940
We are unable to go outside

1374
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:56,170
Police are behind our guys

1375
01:13:56,290 --> 01:13:58,220
We need money 
for expenditure

1376
01:13:58,240 --> 01:14:01,210
You will bring that.

1377
01:14:01,350 --> 01:14:02,500
Sir if you don't go outside

1378
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:04,210
why do you need 
money for expenses?

1379
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:08,410
Balanna!

1380
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:10,380
He is calling

1381
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:14,650
If I say eat panipuri, 
you should just eat it

1382
01:14:14,670 --> 01:14:15,840
I will sir.

1383
01:14:15,870 --> 01:14:17,070
You should not ask

1384
01:14:17,100 --> 01:14:19,480
how many times he scratched 
his butt while preparing it?

1385
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:22,680
OK Sir, I will try. 
But I can't guarantee it

1386
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:27,180
Even I will release Purple Priya

1387
01:14:27,210 --> 01:14:29,570
but I can't guarantee her life.

1388
01:14:29,850 --> 01:14:32,050
Oh! you came in that way?

1389
01:14:33,110 --> 01:14:34,500
Sir, I will do it.

1390
01:14:34,520 --> 01:14:35,730
One minute

1391
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:41,100
Other than you and me

1392
01:14:41,340 --> 01:14:43,850
Nobody should know about this.

1393
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:50,670
Sir these guys know, 
You know it right?

1394
01:14:50,690 --> 01:14:52,390
I am deaf

1395
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:54,780
Remember

1396
01:14:54,910 --> 01:14:57,240
We'll be watching you 24/7

1397
01:14:57,270 --> 01:14:59,330
You can't even come out of here

1398
01:14:59,350 --> 01:15:01,010
And you keep watching me 24/7

1399
01:15:01,030 --> 01:15:03,480
Now come open the door.

1400
01:15:03,790 --> 01:15:05,900
You keep watching me,

1401
01:15:05,930 --> 01:15:07,780
First you fix that punctured tier

1402
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:10,570
Bro, come open this

1403
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:14,840
Now close the door, 
you can watch me 24/7 later.

1404
01:15:19,180 --> 01:15:22,500
Your In-law gave this for you

1405
01:15:26,860 --> 01:15:27,940
Hi Krissh

1406
01:15:27,970 --> 01:15:30,780
You like antiques a lot right?

1407
01:15:31,050 --> 01:15:32,860
That's why I brought you this

1408
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:35,020
Actually I searched a lot

1409
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:38,380
Krissh

1410
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:39,970
Today is our engagement

1411
01:15:40,530 --> 01:15:41,640
Today...

1412
01:15:41,660 --> 01:15:46,610
I am a lot more 
Happier than you are

1413
01:15:47,670 --> 01:15:49,080
Because...

1414
01:15:49,240 --> 01:15:52,170
This day comes only 
once in everyone's life

1415
01:15:52,680 --> 01:15:54,170
Krissh...

1416
01:15:54,220 --> 01:15:56,560
I had no clarity in my life

1417
01:15:57,280 --> 01:15:59,550
What to do, 
How I should be...

1418
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:02,270
Without any commitments...

1419
01:16:02,700 --> 01:16:06,540
I was happy and 
jovial like a queen

1420
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:09,000
But...

1421
01:16:09,030 --> 01:16:10,830
From now, I will be with you

1422
01:16:11,890 --> 01:16:13,150
From now...

1423
01:16:13,170 --> 01:16:15,280
Our world is same

1424
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:18,000
It's so surprising

1425
01:16:18,350 --> 01:16:20,120
Your story is different

1426
01:16:20,150 --> 01:16:21,770
and My story is different

1427
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:25,310
But now together we are 
going to write a new story

1428
01:16:26,590 --> 01:16:28,450
Though our story's are different

1429
01:16:29,090 --> 01:16:31,130
I love this story a lot

1430
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:32,970
Do you know why?

1431
01:16:33,620 --> 01:16:36,580
Because this is the story 
that brought us together.

1432
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:39,200
Krissh

1433
01:16:39,900 --> 01:16:41,730
After 80 years

1434
01:16:42,290 --> 01:16:44,870
Both of us should Hold 
each others hand...

1435
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:47,540
and say, Yes we made it.

1436
01:16:48,260 --> 01:16:50,420
Love you Krissh

1437
01:17:13,970 --> 01:17:15,390
Sir...

1438
01:17:26,770 --> 01:17:28,810
Sir are you taking the vehicle? 
- Yes

1439
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:30,740
I will move those bikes aside

1440
01:17:36,750 --> 01:17:38,300
Thank you sir.

1441
01:17:38,330 --> 01:17:40,830
Sir, our country is progressing

Days to rob a house

1452

How is this possible?

1460
01:18:48,290 --> 01:18:51,750
It did not get the spotlight 
between home work and work from home

1461
01:18:51,770 --> 01:18:53,570
You finished your job,

1462

Don't bring her, stop.

01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:32,590
Sir, I don't need lemon tea

1477
01:19:32,610 --> 01:19:35,280
Purple Priya is enough,

I am giving you another task

1483

01:19:52,770 --> 01:19:55,220
Will you do as I say or not?

01:19:55,780 --> 01:19:57,340
Do you want purple or not?

1488
01:20:00,850 --> 01:20:02,930
Now... 
- Where is she?

1489
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:04,920
You don't worry, she's fine.

1490
01:20:05,350 --> 01:20:07,190
In the Andhra-Karnataka border...

1491
01:20:07,220 --> 01:20:10,190

and now you are saying Kidnap

1510
01:21:00,250 --> 01:21:02,920
If you kidnap her

I will take the responsibility 
of your marriage with Purple

1512

01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:26,980
We were searching for it's key

1520
01:21:28,830 --> 01:21:31,080

1530
01:21:55,420 --> 01:21:56,560
I am always like that

1531
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:58,760
even from my childhood

1532
01:21:58,780 --> 01:22:01,000
I laugh twice on a single joke

1533
01:22:01,540 --> 01:22:03,120
Dude, I'm coming

1534
01:22:03,150 --> 01:22:04,770

Listen to me...

1537
01:22:10,410 --> 01:22:12,730
Why are you throwing my clothes?

1538
01:22:12,750 --> 01:22:14,240
You are my only friend

1539
01:22:14,270 --> 01:22:16,770
You should take responsibility 
of my marriage right?

1540
01:22:16,790 --> 01:22:17,820
Yes...

1541
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:21,330
But why do people 
die, for marriage

1542
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:24,700
Marriage is a huge... 
- Please stop.

1543
01:22:24,730 --> 01:22:27,080
Don't give any suggestion 
unless someone asked you to

1544
01:22:27,100 --> 01:22:29,040
they call it suggestion 
when its not requested

1545
01:22:29,060 --> 01:22:30,430
Please stop, I can't bare it.

1546
01:22:30,460 --> 01:22:33,190
Where is the Zip? 
- It has no Zip

1547
01:22:33,220 --> 01:22:35,470
Where are we going now?

1548
01:22:36,130 --> 01:22:37,180
Keep it

1549
01:22:38,700 --> 01:22:40,770
Does this have a spare tire?

1550
01:22:41,110 --> 01:22:42,950
Will you please come back.

1551
01:22:50,510 --> 01:22:53,060
Brother 
- Where is the trunk?

1552
01:22:55,530 --> 01:22:56,890
Here it is

1553
01:22:57,190 --> 01:22:59,470
What is this? 
- This was in the trunk

1554
01:22:59,500 --> 01:23:01,640
Only this was left 
in an ATM van?

1555
01:23:01,660 --> 01:23:05,060
He has stolen that van after 
they have deposited all the cash

1556
01:23:05,090 --> 01:23:06,990
I Had my doubts on him

1557
01:23:07,020 --> 01:23:08,890
You were fooled

1558
01:23:09,940 --> 01:23:12,420
I already sent him...

1559
01:23:13,350 --> 01:23:16,420
At least he brought this 
on his first attempt

1560
01:23:16,520 --> 01:23:18,160
Keep it there and go.

1561
01:23:18,190 --> 01:23:22,600
This is not even 
sufficient for ten Days

1562
01:23:22,750 --> 01:23:25,160
Will he kidnap her within that?

1563
01:23:25,180 --> 01:23:27,550
I have some work to 
do, I will comeback

1564
01:23:27,680 --> 01:23:29,260
Even he's gone

1565
01:23:35,230 --> 01:23:37,130
Ramanna 
- Sir.

1566
01:23:37,260 --> 01:23:39,670

of that ATM van thief?

I sent that photo on watsapp sir

1568
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:44,170

where is the helmet?

1572
01:24:00,250 --> 01:24:01,240

1573
01:24:01,260 --> 01:24:03,750
That is what I am asking you. 
you go that side

1574
01:24:03,780 --> 01:24:06,240
Stop it, get down

1575
01:24:07,240 --> 01:24:09,660
Hello Sir

1576
01:24:10,280 --> 01:24:12,380

1577
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:14,750

Sir why are you arresting me?

1582
01:24:24,300 --> 01:24:26,120
You stole the ATM van

1583
01:24:27,780 --> 01:24:29,270
Sir, How did you know?

1584
01:24:29,290 --> 01:24:33,280

01:24:34,010 --> 01:24:35,540
without Peeping outside

1586
01:24:35,570 --> 01:24:40,530

you in the act of Peeping

1587
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:42,650
Am I in the CCTV footage? 
- Yes

1588
01:24:42,680 --> 01:24:45,520
Sir, Do I look good? 
- Very good, looks natural

01:24:45,550 --> 01:24:47,360
Is that BBC World news?

1590
01:24:47,390 --> 01:24:49,730
Just a CCTV Camera, 
Don't you have any common sense?

1591
01:24:49,750 --> 01:24:52,360
Come to the station 
- Sir, I'm in deep trouble

1619
01:26:03,680 --> 01:26:05,270
Every time...

1620
01:26:05,290 --> 01:26:08,530
He is escaping 
just because of you

1621
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:10,340
Sir You listen to 
him every time,

1622
01:26:10,370 --> 01:26:12,230

to me even once?

01:26:12,260 --> 01:26:14,830
What does he have in 
excess, that I don't possess?

1624
01:26:14,850 --> 01:26:17,460
That thing 
- what is that thing?

1625
01:26:17,480 --> 01:26:19,990

1626
01:26:20,020 --> 01:26:21,820
He does not have it, 
tell him?

1627
01:26:21,850 --> 01:26:23,630

1628
01:26:23,660 --> 01:26:25,610
Sir now what should we do?

1629
01:26:25,640 --> 01:26:28,220
Not you, 
Tell me what I should do?

1630
01:26:28,250 --> 01:26:30,810
The thing is...

1631
01:26:30,840 --> 01:26:35,090
You should help us 
in this Kidnapping.

1632
01:26:36,410 --> 01:26:39,620
Now which place is it? 
- Kolar sir

1633
01:26:39,640 --> 01:26:42,030
Kolar, Via Mulbagilu...

1634
01:26:43,180 --> 01:26:45,750
Do one thing, 
there's a Halli [lizard]

1635
01:26:45,870 --> 01:26:48,370
Sir Halli [lizard] is in bathroom also 
- Idiot.

1636
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:51,030
You are speaking about an 
animal, I am tell you about a man

1637
01:26:51,060 --> 01:26:53,490
Oh OK 
- Now both of you go there

1638
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:56,680
Now go tell him, 
I said like this

1639
01:26:56,710 --> 01:26:57,550
Like this

1640
01:26:57,580 --> 01:26:59,950
He will do like that

1641
01:27:00,570 --> 01:27:01,940
Kidnap his sister,

1642
01:27:01,970 --> 01:27:03,100
and bring her here

1643
01:27:03,130 --> 01:27:04,370
Like this...

1644
01:27:04,710 --> 01:27:08,030
Please don't say anywhere, 
that I told you this

1645
01:27:08,050 --> 01:27:10,890
Nani you be careful

1646
01:27:11,090 --> 01:27:13,220
Already he's hollow 
- what!

1647
01:27:13,250 --> 01:27:14,720
The thing is... 
- Sir Hollow...

1648
01:27:14,740 --> 01:27:18,160
Tell him 
- I will explain it you later

1649
01:27:18,190 --> 01:27:20,020
Bye sir 
- You go now

1650
01:27:20,040 --> 01:27:22,410

- Just go now

1651
01:27:23,230 --> 01:27:25,110

1652
01:27:25,390 --> 01:27:27,140
Go...

1653
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:39,590
You told car was 
in good condition?

1654
01:27:39,800 --> 01:27:43,090
But this stopped 
80 Times in 8 Km's

1655
01:27:43,120 --> 01:27:44,840
I will be fine if a 
Mechanic inspects it

1656
01:27:44,870 --> 01:27:47,580
You are supposed to show to it 
the Scrap guy, not a Mechanic

1657
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:49,360
I doubt weather it will 
be of any use of to him?

1658
01:27:49,380 --> 01:27:51,410
Check if there is 
any smell or smoke?

1659
01:27:52,040 --> 01:27:53,280
Sir...

1660
01:27:53,550 --> 01:27:55,620
Excuse me Sir

1661
01:27:55,940 --> 01:27:57,950
Is any Mechanic available here?

1662
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:12,790
Will you please check it

1663
01:28:18,690 --> 01:28:20,570
Oh!, I should open the bonnet

1664
01:28:37,950 --> 01:28:39,740
Sir...

1665
01:28:40,260 --> 01:28:42,730
What happened, 
you said you will see the car?

1666
01:28:42,750 --> 01:28:44,810
I just saw it, now go

1667
01:28:44,840 --> 01:28:47,790
Sir, Please repair it...

1668
01:28:49,820 --> 01:28:52,770
It's Ok, even if there is 
no punch in the dialogue

1669
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:54,930
There should be clarity

1670
01:29:01,590 --> 01:29:02,990
One minute

1671
01:29:06,670 --> 01:29:08,320
Come, come do it...

1672
01:29:28,110 --> 01:29:30,560
Take a selfie..

1673
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:31,790

1674
01:29:33,420 --> 01:29:36,290
I said self start the car 
- Oh Ok!

1675
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:43,120

1676
01:29:43,290 --> 01:29:45,230
Thanks a lot sir

1677
01:29:45,500 --> 01:29:47,210
Once Test drive it yourself

1678
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:52,620
What if he steals the car?

1679
01:29:53,470 --> 01:29:55,360

1680
01:29:56,150 --> 01:29:57,390

Sir don't feel bad but...

1686
01:30:17,260 --> 01:30:19,600
Your name feels 
like a ladies name

1687
01:30:22,340 --> 01:30:24,320
Everybody has their 
Father's name as last name

1688
01:30:24,350 --> 01:30:27,610
With love, I have kept My 
Mothers name as my First name

1689
01:30:28,970 --> 01:30:30,330
Love you Mom.

1690
01:30:31,900 --> 01:30:33,390

1694
01:30:44,490 --> 01:30:46,190
Sir, I have a suggestion for you

1695
01:30:47,110 --> 01:30:50,000
Next time when you launch a 
rocket, don't sit down

1696
01:30:50,390 --> 01:30:52,780
Ashes get struck to your face

1697
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,350
Sir does anybody stay 
here in such a huge plot?

1698
01:31:00,370 --> 01:31:01,500
No

1699
01:31:03,160 --> 01:31:06,590
Then why does this tea 
seller have a shop here?

1700
01:31:08,110 --> 01:31:09,830
Stop asking silly questions

1701
01:31:09,850 --> 01:31:11,760

You mean murder?

1707
01:31:23,300 --> 01:31:25,230
He took my vehicle 
to murder someone!?

1708
01:31:25,970 --> 01:31:27,600

Nothing will happen...

1716
01:31:38,970 --> 01:31:41,180
No my mom will scold 
me, we should not see it

1717
01:31:41,350 --> 01:31:42,960
What is wrong with you

1718
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:45,400
Give him some tea 
- Lemon tea sir

1719
01:31:48,300 --> 01:31:49,800
It's Ok, give me normal tea

1720
01:32:02,720 --> 01:32:05,190
Such a scumbag... 
- What is it?

1721
01:32:05,210 --> 01:32:07,870
Listen... 
Sir has something to say

1722
01:32:11,150 --> 01:32:12,280

1723
01:32:13,700 --> 01:32:15,570
What's wrong with these guys

1724
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:17,920
They haven't fueled the car

1725
01:32:19,480 --> 01:32:21,380
Boss, did you finish the Deal

1726
01:32:21,970 --> 01:32:24,130
While coming back after 
finishing the deal

1727
01:32:24,150 --> 01:32:25,720
we escaped it a bit

1728
01:32:25,750 --> 01:32:28,860
Or else, I would be dead by now

1729
01:32:28,890 --> 01:32:31,390
Sir you repaired the car

1730
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:35,490
but you don't have the common 
sense to look at the fuel level

1731
01:32:35,510 --> 01:32:37,560
Boss, He's torturing me 
a lot, I will kill him

1732
01:32:37,590 --> 01:32:39,120
Shraddha.

1733
01:32:44,810 --> 01:32:47,730

you are not from around here

1734
01:32:47,840 --> 01:32:49,370
Where are you from?

We had some work, 
so we are searching him

1737
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:59,410
How can you ask for water, while you 
are standing in front of tsunami

1738
01:32:59,430 --> 01:33:03,060
Boss I will squeeze...

01:33:08,270 --> 01:33:10,470
If I knew, I would have 
filled the whole tank

1743
01:33:10,490 --> 01:33:12,860
He is Halli

1744
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:14,450

We just have to kidnap Venkat 
Reddy's Sister, that's it.

Blood was flowing in 
every streets of Kolar

Washed his hands in blood 
and Played with colors.

In this there is bail papers

1800
01:37:00,990 --> 01:37:03,610
As this is Shravana Month, 
Brother is will be busy

1801
01:37:03,630 --> 01:37:05,890
You keep coming and 
take such papers

1802
01:37:05,920 --> 01:37:07,620
Sir I have some work, 
I will meet you later

1803
01:37:07,640 --> 01:37:08,860
Ok all the best

1804
01:37:09,570 --> 01:37:11,410
Come dear

1805
01:37:11,480 --> 01:37:12,920

1806
01:37:13,200 --> 01:37:15,150
Take it 
- Please take it

1807
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:16,680
Thanks

1808
01:37:17,430 --> 01:37:19,160
After drinking the Horlicks...

1809
01:37:19,190 --> 01:37:21,250
You can keep the 
glass here and go

1810
01:37:21,270 --> 01:37:22,690
Bye...

1811
01:37:24,680 --> 01:37:26,990
This is Venkat Reddy

1812
01:37:27,890 --> 01:37:29,520
How will you go to his 
house, and...

1813
01:37:29,550 --> 01:37:31,570
Kidnap his sister

1814
01:37:32,380 --> 01:37:33,840
Can you?

1815
01:37:33,860 --> 01:37:35,080
That aside....

1816
01:37:35,110 --> 01:37:37,010
Sir is there such a 
scarcity of water in Kolar...

1817
01:37:37,030 --> 01:37:38,840
I mean washing hands in blood.

1818
01:37:39,780 --> 01:37:42,160
I said that for build-up in the flow

1819
01:37:42,180 --> 01:37:43,760
They wash there 
hand in water

1820
01:37:43,780 --> 01:37:45,510
Who does that

1821
01:37:46,340 --> 01:37:48,140
OK, OK 
- If it's for the feel of it

1822
01:37:48,250 --> 01:37:49,870
Sir 
- Yes

1823
01:37:49,890 --> 01:37:52,990
As you said you are 
a Police informer

1824
01:37:53,040 --> 01:37:57,050
and also work with Venkat Reddy.

1825
01:37:57,200 --> 01:38:00,910
You could make a deal with 
police and get him arrested?

1826
01:38:07,540 --> 01:38:09,930
Paga 
- What is Paga sir?

1827
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:12,710
Revenge

1828
01:38:14,360 --> 01:38:16,590
My 40 Year old revenge

1829
01:38:16,900 --> 01:38:18,690
Sir what's your age?

1830
01:38:18,710 --> 01:38:19,960
Thirty two

1831
01:38:20,590 --> 01:38:22,750
Forty year old revenge 
for thirty two year old guy?

1832
01:38:22,770 --> 01:38:24,330
It's illogical sir

1833
01:38:25,790 --> 01:38:27,220
Make it thirty

1834
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:30,770
It's just 2 year old baby, 
what does it know about revenge?

1835
01:38:30,790 --> 01:38:32,490
Will Twenty five work?

1836
01:38:32,520 --> 01:38:33,720
Sir how can you?....

1837
01:38:33,750 --> 01:38:34,780
Fifteen?

1838
01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:37,920
Just an intern, after 
finish graduation

1839
01:38:37,940 --> 01:38:39,470
No way!

1840
01:38:40,260 --> 01:38:41,480
Ten

1841
01:38:41,500 --> 01:38:43,440
Decrease it a bit

1842
01:38:43,510 --> 01:38:45,580
Don't negotiate it a lot

1843
01:38:45,600 --> 01:38:48,370
Make it five years 
- No sir

1844
01:38:56,060 --> 01:38:57,380
At least Six months?

1845
01:38:58,400 --> 01:39:02,440
OK sir, as you are requesting a lot... 
I will agree on 6 months

1846
01:39:02,460 --> 01:39:03,490
Thank you

1847
01:39:03,510 --> 01:39:04,670
Don't say anything else

1848
01:39:04,700 --> 01:39:06,250
Thanks 
- Ok sir

1849
01:39:08,060 --> 01:39:10,190
Revenge of Six months

1850
01:39:10,220 --> 01:39:11,970
Who is that Idiot 
Chanting Paga Paga?

1851
01:39:11,990 --> 01:39:13,870
I will come there and 
kick you out

1852
01:39:13,890 --> 01:39:15,440
Shut-up and sleep

1853
01:39:15,470 --> 01:39:16,720
Come close

1854
01:39:17,370 --> 01:39:19,260
Landlady is scolding...

1855
01:39:19,290 --> 01:39:20,980
Lets go outside and talk

1856
01:39:24,140 --> 01:39:27,180
See this is Venkat Reddy's house

1857
01:39:31,810 --> 01:39:32,850
Thank you sir...

1858
01:39:32,870 --> 01:39:35,050
I will kidnap her and comeback

1859
01:39:35,070 --> 01:39:36,890
Boss...

1860
01:39:36,920 --> 01:39:38,170
Shraddha...

1861
01:39:39,720 --> 01:39:43,420
First go steal Venkat 
Reddy's Chappal and comeback

1862
01:39:45,040 --> 01:39:46,910
Sir don't feel bad but...

1863
01:39:46,930 --> 01:39:50,140
I am capable of bringing a 
lone elephant single handedly

1864
01:39:50,160 --> 01:39:52,690
Give me a bigger task 
Sir, Hit me hard

1865
01:39:52,710 --> 01:39:55,160
Shraddha, Now hit him

1866
01:39:55,180 --> 01:39:58,560
Boss you give me the 
order, I will trash him

1867
01:39:58,590 --> 01:40:00,320
I ordered you just now

1868
01:40:02,510 --> 01:40:03,940
God!

1869
01:40:03,970 --> 01:40:05,020
Look...

1870
01:40:05,050 --> 01:40:07,890
Don't think its too easy to 
enter Venkat Reddy's house

1871
01:40:07,910 --> 01:40:11,700
Minimum 100-150 People 
will be guarding the gate

1872
01:40:12,070 --> 01:40:13,630
But I will give you a hint...

1873
01:40:13,660 --> 01:40:16,360
From 11:25-11:30 PM

1874
01:40:16,810 --> 01:40:18,910
Guards go for a smoke break

1875
01:40:19,300 --> 01:40:21,290
In the meantime you go inside...

1876
01:40:21,350 --> 01:40:23,540
And steal Venkat 
Reddy's Chappal

1877
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:32,230
Hello sir, 
I reached here safely

1878
01:40:32,260 --> 01:40:33,770
I had a doubt...

1879
01:40:33,800 --> 01:40:36,740
Should I steal just the 
Chappal or anything big?

1880
01:40:36,830 --> 01:40:40,830
That is what you get easily, 
steal that and comeback

1881
01:40:49,490 --> 01:40:52,970
Hello sir, 
I need an information

1882
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:56,180
Here, there are just 15 
pairs of footwear not 150

1883
01:40:56,350 --> 01:40:59,470
Steal any one and comeback

1884
01:41:06,720 --> 01:41:08,850
Hello sir, Do you want ladies 
or gents footwear

1885
01:41:08,870 --> 01:41:10,980
I don't know your preference

1886
01:41:11,010 --> 01:41:13,140
That Chappal is not for me...

1887
01:41:13,170 --> 01:41:14,630
It's a test for you

1888
01:41:14,660 --> 01:41:16,860
Oh!, Ok fine sir

1889
01:41:25,550 --> 01:41:27,260
How many times do you call?

1890
01:41:27,280 --> 01:41:30,100
there is one with thong, 
and two without it

1891
01:41:30,130 --> 01:41:32,280
2 pairs with a Pin and 
2 pair of ladies Chappal

1892
01:41:32,300 --> 01:41:34,540
Which one do I should 
pick for you, sir...

1893
01:41:34,770 --> 01:41:38,180
Bring the one you are wearing 
- Ok sir

1894
01:41:40,350 --> 01:41:43,080
Calling so many times...

1895
01:41:43,280 --> 01:41:45,500
How do you tolerate him?

1896
01:41:46,270 --> 01:41:48,540
You don't know 
anything about me

1897
01:41:52,240 --> 01:41:53,840
Who are you?

1898
01:41:53,870 --> 01:41:56,730
Sir.. Chappal... footwear, foot....

1899
01:41:57,020 --> 01:41:59,810
Dynamite?, Catch him

1900
01:41:59,840 --> 01:42:02,330
Don't shoot, catch him

1901
01:42:02,350 --> 01:42:06,020
Catch him, stop running

1902
01:42:06,050 --> 01:42:07,440
Stop...

1903
01:42:08,020 --> 01:42:11,860
Boss he's coming... 
- Wait till he's here

1904
01:42:16,570 --> 01:42:18,560
Finally, What did you do?

1905
01:42:18,860 --> 01:42:21,050
They did even let me 
remove my slippers

1906
01:42:21,070 --> 01:42:22,580
I ran fast

1907
01:42:22,640 --> 01:42:24,130
What kind of people are they?

1908
01:42:24,160 --> 01:42:26,920
They waste 400 Rs bullet 
for 40 Rs Chappal

1909
01:42:27,120 --> 01:42:28,850
Comedy...

1910
01:42:28,970 --> 01:42:30,940
How is the security?

1911
01:42:30,970 --> 01:42:33,730
Sir they have security 
but no maturity

1912
01:42:34,490 --> 01:42:37,200
You are talented 
- Thank you sir

1913
01:42:38,210 --> 01:42:40,110
But you lack technique 
- What?

1914
01:42:40,830 --> 01:42:42,600
From tomorrow...

1915
01:42:42,620 --> 01:42:44,870
I will train you

1916
01:42:45,650 --> 01:42:46,760
Ok sir

1917
01:42:50,870 --> 01:42:52,460
This is Power goddess

1918
01:42:52,490 --> 01:42:54,320
This Goddess protected me

1919
01:42:54,340 --> 01:42:56,540
You need it's blessings a lot

1920
01:42:56,560 --> 01:42:58,050
Take its blessings

1921
01:43:01,010 --> 01:43:03,750
That should be in your 
heart, get up

1922
01:43:05,970 --> 01:43:06,970
Ok

1923
01:43:07,690 --> 01:43:09,670
How is the Josh? 
- High sir

1924
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:11,250
Not like that.

1925
01:43:11,280 --> 01:43:12,600
How is the Josh?

1926
01:43:12,630 --> 01:43:13,580

to the world

1934
01:43:49,430 --> 01:43:53,360

Whole world will follow you

1937
01:44:04,170 --> 01:44:08,180
You are the essence of Bheema

1938
01:44:08,350 --> 01:44:15,030
You are from the Creed who 
doesn’t step back without winning

1939
01:44:15,310 --> 01:44:21,590
Oh! Warrior strike like 
Thunder and lightning

1940
01:44:22,760 --> 01:44:29,400

and Kali of the Kaliyuga

1941
01:44:30,600 --> 01:44:35,150

1942
01:44:35,450 --> 01:44:38,320

How is the Josh Now?

1943
01:44:41,850 --> 01:44:43,630
I would have done it here

1944
01:44:43,800 --> 01:44:45,700
You were supposed to jump

1945
01:44:46,150 --> 01:44:47,730
Sir shall I jump now?

1946
01:44:48,880 --> 01:44:52,140
You fiddled enemy's 
eyes, with your finger

1947
01:44:52,170 --> 01:44:55,130
Your Fingers are like knifes

1948
01:44:55,700 --> 01:44:59,510
You filled there heart with fear

1949
01:44:59,710 --> 01:45:03,060
You are an angry Lion

1950
01:45:03,260 --> 01:45:07,290
When the coach is 
with you stop worrying

1951
01:45:07,320 --> 01:45:10,770
Your goal is in 
front of you, go ahead

1952
01:45:10,900 --> 01:45:15,290

1954
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:29,440

1955
01:45:31,530 --> 01:45:34,430
Today Your training 
is completed

1956
01:45:34,600 --> 01:45:36,480
Sir, We trained for just one day!?

1957
01:45:36,800 --> 01:45:39,510
You were saying lone 
elephant, single hand...

1958
01:45:39,540 --> 01:45:40,700
Not like that sir

1959
01:45:40,720 --> 01:45:43,460
I am capable of bringing a 
lone elephant single handedly

1960
01:45:43,480 --> 01:45:45,170
This is the dialogue

1961
01:45:45,200 --> 01:45:47,120
we don't need correction 
during the Kidnap

1962
01:45:47,150 --> 01:45:48,770
Sorry sir

1963
01:45:48,790 --> 01:45:51,660
Ok, You remember the plan right?

1964
01:45:51,680 --> 01:45:53,750
I was involved in the song sir

1965
01:45:53,780 --> 01:45:56,410
I forgot the plan, 
What do I do?

1966
01:45:57,580 --> 01:45:59,200
Listen 
- Yes sir

1967
01:45:59,230 --> 01:46:01,670
As you enter the house 
there are 2 staircases

1968
01:46:01,700 --> 01:46:03,730
From this side its third room

1969
01:46:03,750 --> 01:46:05,510
From that side second room

1970
01:46:05,540 --> 01:46:08,310
As you enter the house 
Shraddha will cut electricity

1971
01:46:08,330 --> 01:46:10,610
You enter the room,

I don't know how to 
drive a car

1982
01:46:33,370 --> 01:46:41,360
Can a flower bloom 
from a shriveled Vine?

1983
01:46:56,730 --> 01:46:58,320
Can you see the light?

1984

You don't say anything, 
be quite

1989
01:47:17,080 --> 01:47:19,340
You went office in the morning

1990

And meet me in the evening

1991
01:47:22,180 --> 01:47:24,240
And went to home in the night

1992
01:47:25,280 --> 01:47:26,830

And in the night, 
you knock doors like a thief.

01:47:37,690 --> 01:47:39,650
Everything for that bloody Owl

1997
01:47:39,830 --> 01:47:40,920

You are taking lot of lenience 
just because you are my friend

2002
01:47:48,530 --> 01:47:50,490
Go away from here

01:54:45,320 --> 01:54:47,270
So simple! 
- It's very simple

2146
01:54:47,300 --> 01:54:49,650
Thank you sir, 
I will come back

2147
01:54:50,590 --> 01:54:52,540
Papi...

2148
01:54:52,560 --> 01:54:54,480
Boss!...

2149
01:54:54,540 --> 01:54:56,930
Idiot, I have a hole in heart

2150
01:54:56,950 --> 01:54:59,840
Sir, can we kill him 
- you should!

2151
01:55:00,410 --> 01:55:03,900
But, His death should 
be so ruthless that

2152
01:55:03,920 --> 01:55:07,670
Media should show it for a week

2153
01:55:07,850 --> 01:55:10,050
It should become such a news

2154
01:55:21,740 --> 01:55:24,490
Why are walking like that?,

2155
01:55:24,520 --> 01:55:26,250
come sit down.

2156
01:55:26,860 --> 01:55:30,080
Sit down, What is it?

2157
01:55:31,630 --> 01:55:33,270
what Happened?

2158
01:55:33,850 --> 01:55:35,910
There is a small error

2159
01:55:37,740 --> 01:55:40,370
Car is exchanged right?

2160
01:55:40,480 --> 01:55:42,740
You are absolutely right sir.

2161
01:55:42,770 --> 01:55:44,400
I... 
- How many cars do you have?

2162
01:55:44,430 --> 01:55:45,800
Just one sir.

2163
01:55:45,830 --> 01:55:48,440
How can one car get exchanged

2164
01:55:49,520 --> 01:55:51,650
My friend took my car...

2165
01:55:51,670 --> 01:55:55,430
And I have brought his car

2166
01:55:55,800 --> 01:55:58,850
So, did both cars 
have the same key?

2167
01:55:58,870 --> 01:56:01,100
How's my point? 
- super

2168
01:56:01,660 --> 01:56:05,080
Madam, had left her 
bag in a room

2169
01:56:05,110 --> 01:56:07,410
She went back to get it,

2170
01:56:07,440 --> 01:56:09,690
My friend took my car

2171
01:56:09,710 --> 01:56:11,910
I drove my friends car

2172
01:56:11,930 --> 01:56:14,020
This is agreeable

2173
01:56:14,050 --> 01:56:15,660
Sir, it's not convincing

2174
01:56:15,760 --> 01:56:17,130
He's not convinced?

2175
01:56:17,160 --> 01:56:18,630
Sir you are a lawyer right?

2176
01:56:18,650 --> 01:56:21,290
You have intelligent, 
How did you know?

2177
01:56:21,320 --> 01:56:24,400
You are in Lawyer costume

2178
01:56:25,270 --> 01:56:27,650
Sir now lets not waste time 
- yes

2179
01:56:27,680 --> 01:56:29,210
Lets do one thing...

2180
01:56:29,240 --> 01:56:31,770
It takes 3 Hours go 
there and come back

2181
01:56:31,790 --> 01:56:35,320
If you give me three hours, 
I will make her sit in front of you

2182
01:56:35,740 --> 01:56:37,790
Is this a comedy show?

2183
01:56:37,930 --> 01:56:40,210
I can't give you three Hours, 
within two...

2184
01:56:40,240 --> 01:56:42,370
Stop... Sir stop it

2185
01:56:42,400 --> 01:56:44,710
Why do you shout so much 
with a hole in the heart

2186
01:56:44,730 --> 01:56:46,590
Why are you telling 
it in front of him?

2187
01:56:46,620 --> 01:56:50,070
I will give you 4 Hours, 
go bring her

2188
01:56:50,220 --> 01:56:52,880
Thank you sir 
- If you don't bring her

2189
01:56:52,910 --> 01:56:55,490
I will teach you a lesson

2190
01:56:55,520 --> 01:56:57,400
Stop... I have...

2191
01:56:57,490 --> 01:56:58,700
Sir, One request 
- What is it?

2192
01:56:58,720 --> 01:57:01,600
Increase his salary, 
He's working hard

2193
01:57:02,980 --> 01:57:06,180
He asked for 3 Hours, 
why did you give him 4 Hours?

2194
01:57:06,240 --> 01:57:08,360
Boss, If he did not 
comeback in four hours

2195
01:57:08,390 --> 01:57:09,790
lets put all our cases on him

2196
01:57:09,820 --> 01:57:11,040
You stay calm,

2197
01:57:11,060 --> 01:57:14,160
I have some work in 
court, I will come back.

2198
01:57:28,460 --> 01:57:31,670
In this election 
let's help that Raju

2199
01:57:31,690 --> 01:57:33,980
Boss, twenty five 
thousand is very less

2200
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:35,670
At least he gave that,

2201
01:57:35,690 --> 01:57:37,570
No other guy is 
giving us anything

2202
01:57:37,590 --> 01:57:39,350
Who is Robin hood here?

2203
01:57:39,370 --> 01:57:41,600
How dare enquire about 
us, in our own place

2204
01:57:41,630 --> 01:57:43,580
It's Ok, let him go. 
you come this side

2205
01:57:43,600 --> 01:57:44,910
What is it?

2206
01:57:44,940 --> 01:57:48,430
Boss is calling, Will you come with 
Me, or should I kidnap you?

2207
01:57:49,130 --> 01:57:50,550
Balanna!

2208
01:57:54,190 --> 01:57:56,210
I am the boss here right? 
- Yes Boss

2209
01:57:56,240 --> 01:57:57,710
Which Boss is he talking about?

2210
01:57:57,740 --> 01:58:00,240
Who is he? 
- Venkat Reddy

2211
01:58:00,260 --> 01:58:01,870
Tell him, I will come

2212
01:58:01,890 --> 01:58:03,100
Now you go, 
we will come

2213
01:58:03,130 --> 01:58:05,730
Come to our place, 
I will teach you a lesson

2214
01:58:08,460 --> 01:58:10,070
Look at the house it's so beautiful

2215
01:58:10,420 --> 01:58:12,950
Yeah! 
- Mom!, Dad!

2216
01:58:13,480 --> 01:58:15,740
Dad did you join Rowdyism?

2217
01:58:15,760 --> 01:58:17,130
They have kidnapped us

2218
01:58:17,160 --> 01:58:19,720
Yeah, even I was wondering 
when you became so gutsy

2219
01:58:19,750 --> 01:58:22,860
Shut up, we prayed 
so much for your birth

2220
01:58:22,990 --> 01:58:24,870
If I knew you would 
turn out like this...

2221
01:58:24,890 --> 01:58:26,870
I would have ate 
two pieces of Papaya

2222
01:58:26,890 --> 01:58:28,860
now shut-up! 
why are you weeping?

2223
01:58:28,880 --> 01:58:31,130
Everything I say 
looks like weeping to you

2224
01:58:31,150 --> 01:58:32,850
Now stop shouting,

2225
01:58:32,870 --> 01:58:34,540
we are in someone else's house

2226
01:58:34,570 --> 01:58:36,560
As if this is a library,

2227
01:58:36,580 --> 01:58:39,580
And scholars are 
widening their knowledge

2228
01:58:40,940 --> 01:58:43,040
Don't spare him, 
He kicked the door frame,

2229
01:58:43,070 --> 01:58:44,570
Collect Three thousand from him

2230
01:58:44,590 --> 01:58:47,160
Didn't I say, we are 
from Rowdyism family

2231
01:58:47,180 --> 01:58:48,870
He's in rowdyism 
from three days,

2232
01:58:48,890 --> 01:58:51,150
He will kill you for sure

2233
01:58:51,180 --> 01:58:53,490
Though it's nice dialogue, 
this is not the right time

2234
01:58:53,510 --> 01:58:56,670
Why, doesn’t it work? 
- it will work on us

2235
01:58:56,700 --> 01:58:57,830
Is it!

2236
01:58:57,850 --> 01:58:59,810
Uncle how did you come here?

2237
01:58:59,830 --> 01:59:02,510
I came to your house 
to talk with your dad...

2238
01:59:02,530 --> 01:59:04,310
Oh! you were Kidnapped,

2239
01:59:04,340 --> 01:59:06,310
You are having a very bad phase

2240
01:59:06,330 --> 01:59:09,380
Yeah! as if you are having 
a tremendous phase in life

2241
01:59:09,410 --> 01:59:13,390
Isn't the Joviality visible... 
- ask him to shut-up.

2242
01:59:39,770 --> 01:59:41,700
Good afternoon sir

2243
01:59:41,730 --> 01:59:44,270
Sir why did you bring 
me, not me..

2244
01:59:44,300 --> 01:59:45,840
Why did you kidnap my family?

2245
01:59:45,870 --> 01:59:47,440
Have I done anything 
to your family?

2246
01:59:47,470 --> 01:59:49,820
You Kidnapped My Wife.

2247
01:59:49,850 --> 01:59:52,680
Oh! Wife is also family

2248
01:59:52,700 --> 01:59:54,090
Sorry

2249
01:59:54,850 --> 01:59:59,290
My House is like a Parliment 
- Yes sir

2250
01:59:59,610 --> 02:00:03,700
To come in, there are 
hundred types of checking

2251
02:00:03,730 --> 02:00:07,860
How did you kidnapped 
My wife so easily

2252
02:00:07,880 --> 02:00:10,790
How? 
- Because of the training sir

2253
02:00:11,390 --> 02:00:13,150
Training?

2254
02:00:13,180 --> 02:00:14,380
He saying, training.

2255
02:00:14,410 --> 02:00:15,560
Sir I did not train him!

2256
02:00:15,590 --> 02:00:17,140
You did not train Him?

2257
02:00:18,630 --> 02:00:20,960
Who? 
- His name is Halli sir

2258
02:00:20,990 --> 02:00:22,490
He trains well

2259
02:00:23,280 --> 02:00:24,990
Lizard?

2260
02:00:25,090 --> 02:00:26,570
Where is the lizard?

2261
02:00:26,600 --> 02:00:29,550
Sir, its not that? 
the short guy

2262
02:00:29,810 --> 02:00:33,580
Our guy, with curly... 
- yes he's the guy

2263
02:00:34,200 --> 02:00:36,690
Bring that dog here 
- Not Dog sir, Halli

2264
02:00:36,710 --> 02:00:38,390
Our guy!

2265
02:00:38,660 --> 02:00:40,780
Slowly...

2266
02:00:42,530 --> 02:00:44,550
Hey Dog, come here

2267
02:00:58,430 --> 02:01:00,530
Get lost, go... stand there

2268
02:01:02,790 --> 02:01:05,040
Do you know him?

2269
02:01:06,350 --> 02:01:09,370
Yes sir, He is Halli. 
He trained me well

2270
02:01:09,870 --> 02:01:12,540
Do you know him? 
- Boss, who is this new guy...

2271
02:01:12,570 --> 02:01:14,680
I don't know him.

2272
02:01:15,090 --> 02:01:16,960
Sir, I think he has 
forgotten me.

2273
02:01:16,980 --> 02:01:18,920
Halli sir, its me 
- be quite

2274
02:01:18,940 --> 02:01:21,170
How is the Josh? 
He taught me

2275
02:01:21,200 --> 02:01:22,890
How is the Josh? 
High sir

2276
02:01:22,910 --> 02:01:24,460
How is the Josh?

2277
02:01:25,360 --> 02:01:28,540
Boss, I don't know him, 
It's the first time I'm seeing him

2278
02:01:28,570 --> 02:01:29,690
Sir!..

2279
02:01:29,890 --> 02:01:31,960
Oh! was I not 
supposed to say it?

2280
02:01:31,990 --> 02:01:33,140
Idiot!

2281
02:01:33,160 --> 02:01:35,210

I had a doubt on 
you from many days

02:01:44,850 --> 02:01:46,910
I knew you would 
cause trouble

2286
02:01:47,680 --> 02:01:49,190
I think this is it

2287
02:01:49,210 --> 02:01:52,530

Oh god

02:02:33,500 --> 02:02:35,530
Aunt, your daughter is here

2299
02:02:35,670 --> 02:02:37,340
Hi Purple!

Was he really here?

2315
02:04:38,760 --> 02:04:40,620
I was with you Boss..

2316
02:04:40,650 --> 02:04:43,660
Why did you come? 
- Oh god

I came here, just now

2320
02:04:50,440 --> 02:04:52,640
Oh!, take that gun 
and shoot yourself

2321
02:04:52,660 --> 02:04:54,520
What is it? 
- Yes sir, he was here.

2322
02:04:54,540 --> 02:04:55,910
In the same spot

2323
02:04:56,970 --> 02:04:59,280
Everybody's hands 
are tied except his,

2324
02:04:59,310 --> 02:05:00,440
Is he your relative?

2325
02:05:00,470 --> 02:05:02,210
No Boss 
- Go tie his hands

2326
02:05:25,190 --> 02:05:26,500
Boss

2327
02:05:26,750 --> 02:05:27,810
Welcome

2328
02:05:28,890 --> 02:05:33,210
I know you are not the 
guys, I was waiting for

2329
02:05:34,250 --> 02:05:36,290
That diamond box in your hand...

2330
02:05:36,500 --> 02:05:38,920
It know it does not have 
any diamonds

2331
02:05:39,400 --> 02:05:41,700
Then why waste time

2332
02:05:42,030 --> 02:05:44,760
Let's go for action

2333
02:05:56,150 --> 02:05:57,530
Come fast

2334
02:05:57,550 --> 02:05:58,670
Go that side

2335
02:05:58,700 --> 02:05:59,760
Even you are here

2336
02:05:59,780 --> 02:06:00,780
So sweet Krissh

2337
02:06:00,810 --> 02:06:02,280
Remove the knot

2338
02:06:17,640 --> 02:06:19,710
Somebody come shoot me

2339
02:06:19,740 --> 02:06:21,800
Please come shoot me

2340
02:06:27,110 --> 02:06:29,410
All this happened 
because I followed you

2341
02:06:29,430 --> 02:06:31,260
Sir, for the wedding...

2342
02:06:31,310 --> 02:06:33,130
What if we add the dish with...

2343
02:06:33,160 --> 02:06:35,110
Carrot and Groundnuts?

2344
02:06:35,140 --> 02:06:36,990
I heard nowadays 
Corn is the trend

2345
02:06:37,010 --> 02:06:38,320
Lets add that

2346
02:06:38,350 --> 02:06:40,350
What do you say? 
- what's in that, anything is fine

2347
02:06:40,380 --> 02:06:42,060
Lower your head

2348
02:06:52,310 --> 02:06:53,700
For god's sake...

2349
02:06:53,730 --> 02:06:55,250
Come, come here 
shoot me

2350
02:06:55,270 --> 02:06:57,780
Leave me, go away...

2351
02:06:58,510 --> 02:07:00,030
Sinners

2352
02:07:01,840 --> 02:07:03,580
Are you afraid Krissh?

2353
02:07:03,600 --> 02:07:06,500
No I'm holding it so 
you don't get afraid

2354
02:07:06,850 --> 02:07:08,750
I am not afraid

2355
02:07:09,970 --> 02:07:13,470
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, Section 302

2356
02:07:23,030 --> 02:07:24,400
Fifteen

2357
02:07:25,970 --> 02:07:27,930
Oh! what is this?

2358
02:07:28,020 --> 02:07:29,560
Bomb!

2359
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:39,940
For my daughter...

2360
02:07:39,970 --> 02:07:42,040
I have kept twenty five Lakhs aside

2361
02:07:42,070 --> 02:07:44,380
Is it! lets have a blast...

2362
02:07:44,400 --> 02:07:45,590
Look you should...

2363
02:07:45,620 --> 02:07:46,420
Oh!!!

2364
02:07:46,440 --> 02:07:48,080
I want to buy 
Kanchivaram Silk saree

2365
02:07:48,110 --> 02:07:50,270
we are dying here, do you 
want to talk about the saree

2366
02:07:50,290 --> 02:07:53,810
I was thinking, 
why don't you go and fight there

2367
02:07:55,860 --> 02:07:58,360
I thought of taking your 
permission, before I fight

2368
02:07:58,380 --> 02:08:00,680
Permission granted, 
Go fight now

2369
02:08:01,700 --> 02:08:03,750
I am a born fighter

2370
02:08:04,120 --> 02:08:05,180
The thing is...

2371
02:08:05,200 --> 02:08:06,300
I will go, 
- Go Krissh

2372
02:08:06,330 --> 02:08:08,040
Go fast 
go, go, go

2373
02:08:49,670 --> 02:08:51,370
Why did you!?

2374
02:08:51,710 --> 02:08:53,950
You saved my life

2375
02:08:54,040 --> 02:08:55,510
You saved Reddy's life

2376
02:08:55,540 --> 02:08:56,690
What do you want? 
Ask me...

2377
02:08:56,710 --> 02:08:58,570
Ask me anything other 
than Money and assets

2378
02:08:58,590 --> 02:09:01,360
I will grant it to you 
- Sir I don't want any of that

2379
02:09:01,390 --> 02:09:03,710
Get your sister married with me

2380
02:09:03,730 --> 02:09:04,980
You are telling me this now?

2381
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:07,950
She went to Bangkok, just because I 
did not buy her Mobile back cover.

2382
02:09:07,970 --> 02:09:09,440
Really? 
- She will comeback

2383
02:09:09,470 --> 02:09:11,760
When she's back, I will 
arrange her marriage with you

2384
02:09:11,780 --> 02:09:12,880
And one more thing,

2385
02:09:12,900 --> 02:09:15,130
don't wear this candy seller 
dress when she's here.

2386
02:09:15,150 --> 02:09:16,740
She will get afraid 
and go to Hongkong

2387
02:09:16,770 --> 02:09:19,890
I will give her to you. 
- Ok sir

2388
02:09:21,660 --> 02:09:23,230
You did not elope?

2389
02:09:25,880 --> 02:09:26,880
Dear...

2390
02:09:27,250 --> 02:09:28,340
I am sorry...

2391
02:09:29,170 --> 02:09:30,210
Forgive me.

2392
02:09:31,940 --> 02:09:34,720
When a husband makes a 
mistake wife forgives

2393
02:09:35,320 --> 02:09:37,980
You made a mistake, 
This Reddy will forgive you

2394
02:09:38,380 --> 02:09:42,450
Papi, Cancel that 
Divorce Application

2395
02:09:43,250 --> 02:09:45,170
Is it deep?

2396
02:09:45,200 --> 02:09:46,930
Sorry it's bleeding

2397
02:09:47,060 --> 02:09:48,520
Krissh 
- What is it?

2398
02:09:48,640 --> 02:09:50,390
I told you to fight

2399
02:09:50,490 --> 02:09:52,540
You fired a gun! 
- Yes I did

2400
02:09:52,570 --> 02:09:55,600
I Did not think your 
life would be so violent

2401
02:09:55,620 --> 02:09:58,540
No, No Krissh. 
we have to breakup

2402
02:09:58,570 --> 02:10:00,880
Bye.. 
- But Purple...

2403
02:10:00,900 --> 02:10:02,600
Why, Purple one minute

2404
02:10:02,620 --> 02:10:03,980
Why, What did I...

2405
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:05,720
I forgot to tell you 
an important dialogue

2406
02:10:05,740 --> 02:10:06,770
What is it?

2407
02:10:06,800 --> 02:10:09,180
You will get a better girl 
than Me, Ok bye

2408
02:10:09,970 --> 02:10:11,040
Purple...

2409
02:10:15,770 --> 02:10:17,390
Gubbi 
- Call me Krissh

2410
02:10:17,420 --> 02:10:18,870
Ok something...

2411
02:10:18,900 --> 02:10:20,740
This is why elders said

2412
02:10:20,770 --> 02:10:23,570
Relationships are 
cattle and wife's....

2413
02:10:23,890 --> 02:10:26,850
Actually it is, Every relations are 
the result of previous birth bondage

2414
02:10:26,880 --> 02:10:30,560
Your life is going haywire, 
do you need corrections now?

2415
02:10:30,890 --> 02:10:32,930
The count of hair I have 
on my 60 year old head

2416
02:10:32,960 --> 02:10:34,620
is not visible on 
your 30 year old head

2417
02:10:34,640 --> 02:10:36,120
Don't talk abut my hair...

2418
02:10:36,150 --> 02:10:37,610
This was meant to happen

2419
02:10:37,680 --> 02:10:39,890
I thought of saying no 
to you when you came home

2420
02:10:39,920 --> 02:10:41,600
But I couldn’t say it that day

2421
02:10:41,630 --> 02:10:43,130
You deserved this

2422
02:10:43,160 --> 02:10:45,670
Listen, not just Mother's curse

2423
02:10:45,700 --> 02:10:47,150
Even Dog's...

2424
02:10:47,310 --> 02:10:50,130
Father's Curse work

2425
02:10:50,150 --> 02:10:52,900
You will be destroyed, 
- What...

2426
02:10:57,330 --> 02:10:58,470
Mom...

2427
02:10:58,490 --> 02:10:59,960
Even she left me

2428
02:11:00,210 --> 02:11:02,010
Now only You can 
find me a girl

2429
02:11:02,390 --> 02:11:03,630
I accept my defeat

2430
02:11:03,660 --> 02:11:05,090
No Gubbi...

2431
02:11:05,110 --> 02:11:06,340
Even I lost

2432
02:11:06,540 --> 02:11:07,550
Mom...

2433
02:11:07,570 --> 02:11:10,240
They say, even when all the god's fail. 
Mother god never fails you

2434
02:11:10,260 --> 02:11:11,600
But you are saying...

2435
02:11:11,630 --> 02:11:13,250
If your words are really true

2436
02:11:13,280 --> 02:11:15,470
Salman Khan would have 
been married by now

2437
02:11:15,490 --> 02:11:17,930
Mom... 
- No Kanchivarm & carrot dish

2438
02:11:18,060 --> 02:11:20,740
Dad, Dad... 
- What is it?

2439
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:22,660
What is your decision on this?

2440
02:11:23,100 --> 02:11:24,600
Same as your mother

2441
02:11:28,820 --> 02:11:30,670
Gubbi what happened?

2442
02:11:30,690 --> 02:11:32,470
Krissh, thank you so much.

2443
02:11:32,490 --> 02:11:34,500
I thought of taking your 
marriage responsibility

2444
02:11:34,530 --> 02:11:36,540
But You made my marriage 
Possible, Thank you

2445
02:11:36,570 --> 02:11:37,520
Stop it.

2446
02:11:37,550 --> 02:11:38,900
You should come to my marriage

2447
02:11:38,920 --> 02:11:40,150
don't miss it 
- I won't come

2448
02:11:40,170 --> 02:11:41,630
Krissh you can't say like that

2449
02:11:41,650 --> 02:11:43,900
You should.. 
- no matter what you do, I won't.

2450
02:11:52,720 --> 02:11:58,160
How can you bring me to eat Palav 
in someone else's wedding

2451
02:11:58,190 --> 02:11:59,780
Is it a right thing?

2452
02:11:59,800 --> 02:12:01,540
Shut up, I will kill you

2453
02:12:08,360 --> 02:12:09,770

You asked me fire

I did not ask you to fire 
- Mostly Mom said...

02:13:16,300 --> 02:13:18,270
After all that, 
why did you break-up

2478
02:13:18,290 --> 02:13:21,090
Do you know I'm in 
Depression, Look at my beard

2541
02:15:46,880 --> 02:15:48,450

02:15:48,470 --> 02:15:50,270

2543
02:15:50,350 --> 02:15:52,180
