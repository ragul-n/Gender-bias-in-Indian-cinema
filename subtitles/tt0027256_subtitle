3
00:02:19,766 --> 00:02:21,635
Hey, open the gate.

4
00:02:22,902 --> 00:02:24,549
The gate can't open.

5
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:27,220
12.50 train is arriving.

6
00:02:29,922 --> 00:02:31,682
It isn't 12 yet.

7
00:02:32,007 --> 00:02:34,195
What's my fault in it, sir?

8
00:02:34,866 --> 00:02:37,935
I just can't open the
gate before 1 O'clock.

9
00:02:38,649 --> 00:02:41,082
Between 12 and 1..

10
00:02:43,585 --> 00:02:46,197
Ghosts come here. Ghosts.

11
00:02:46,795 --> 00:02:48,010
All right.

12
00:02:52,805 --> 00:02:53,808
Here you go.

13
00:02:54,028 --> 00:02:56,693
Lord Rama.

14
00:03:26,393 --> 00:03:27,825
How did it come to you?

15
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:30,216
It fell from your pocket.

16
00:03:35,742 --> 00:03:43,742
"Krishna lives in
the entire universe."

17
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:53,500
"Krishna lives in
the entire universe."

18
00:04:06,505 --> 00:04:14,505
"In water, in land,
in sky and in air."

19
00:04:16,719 --> 00:04:24,719
"In water, in land,
in sky and in air."

20
00:04:26,704 --> 00:04:34,704
"In tall and short houses."

21
00:04:36,772 --> 00:04:44,772
"In tall and short houses."

22
00:04:46,897 --> 00:04:54,897
"Radha stays in his flowers."

23
00:04:55,277 --> 00:04:56,469
Go back.

24
00:04:56,549 --> 00:04:59,611
Is your dear Narendra sitting
here for which you've come?

25
00:04:59,691 --> 00:05:04,898
"Radha stays in his flowers."

26
00:05:05,189 --> 00:05:13,189
"Krishna lives in
the entire universe."

27
00:05:14,687 --> 00:05:22,687
"Krishna lives in
the entire universe."

28
00:05:24,809 --> 00:05:27,242
He sacrificed his life.

29
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,366
To save the lives of others.

30
00:05:31,361 --> 00:05:32,743
Yes.

31
00:05:33,153 --> 00:05:35,514
He sacrificed his life.

32
00:05:35,594 --> 00:05:38,408
To save the lives of others.

33
00:05:44,331 --> 00:05:45,979
She was Goddess.

34
00:05:46,909 --> 00:05:48,936
Yes, Goddess.

35
00:05:49,867 --> 00:05:51,989
Untouchable by birth.

36
00:05:52,417 --> 00:05:54,822
But Goddess by her actions.

37
00:05:55,644 --> 00:05:59,431
Her life story is a pious story.

38
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:06,022
Hearing and narrating
it gives peace the soul.

39
00:06:07,329 --> 00:06:08,384
Peace.

40
00:06:09,372 --> 00:06:11,653
Narrate it to me as well.

41
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:13,690
All right.

42
00:06:14,077 --> 00:06:18,151
I pull curtain from the past world.

43
00:06:18,549 --> 00:06:23,423
So that you see for yourself,
listen and experience.

44
00:06:23,503 --> 00:06:25,366
She loved him more than her own life.

45
00:06:25,744 --> 00:06:28,033
Because he wasn't like other boys.

46
00:06:30,362 --> 00:06:32,998
What will you feel if
someone puts you in a cage?

47
00:06:33,078 --> 00:06:34,416
I'll feel very bad.

48
00:06:34,496 --> 00:06:36,129
- Isn't it, Kasturi?
- Yes.

49
00:06:36,348 --> 00:06:39,441
If you show a red flag,
the train stops.

50
00:06:39,521 --> 00:06:42,184
If you show a green flag,
the train goes.

51
00:06:42,556 --> 00:06:45,604
My father is richer than your father.

52
00:06:45,684 --> 00:06:49,239
He can stop all trains.

53
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:51,145
And my father won't give flour.

54
00:06:51,408 --> 00:06:52,838
The whole village will die of hunger.

55
00:06:52,862 --> 00:06:53,607
Tell me.

56
00:06:53,687 --> 00:06:55,722
The boy belonged to the Brahmin caste.

57
00:06:56,303 --> 00:06:57,798
And girl, untouchable.

58
00:06:58,443 --> 00:07:02,380
Still their fathers were
best friends with each other.

59
00:07:02,924 --> 00:07:03,821
Because.

60
00:07:03,901 --> 00:07:05,270
- What happened?
- What happened?

61
00:07:05,906 --> 00:07:08,414
It's a snake bite.
We've called for a physician.

62
00:07:35,542 --> 00:07:39,539
Nothing to worry.
I sucked all the poison.

63
00:07:55,529 --> 00:07:59,630
Please forgive me, priest.
I touched you.

64
00:07:59,901 --> 00:08:03,113
What do I do?
Your life was a risk.

65
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:10,952
Childhood passed as time passed.

66
00:08:12,126 --> 00:08:13,346
Kasturi.

67
00:08:14,336 --> 00:08:15,465
Pratap.

68
00:08:17,652 --> 00:08:18,652
Where are you going?

69
00:08:18,717 --> 00:08:20,929
I am going to the nearby
village to bring cereals.

70
00:08:21,172 --> 00:08:22,996
- Come on, you also come.
- All right.

71
00:08:38,543 --> 00:08:42,923
Brother, Mohanlal.
Now you stop visiting our house.

72
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:46,218
You belong to a high caste, we low.

73
00:08:46,642 --> 00:08:50,144
Entire village has become
your enemy because of this.

74
00:08:50,633 --> 00:08:51,633
Brother.

75
00:08:52,186 --> 00:08:55,401
Your and my relationship
is not about high and low.

76
00:08:56,465 --> 00:08:58,397
Can I ever forget..

77
00:08:59,022 --> 00:09:02,763
That you risked
your life to save mine?

78
00:09:03,818 --> 00:09:05,814
What you did for me..

79
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,165
A brother doesn't
do it for another brother.

80
00:09:08,828 --> 00:09:10,993
Whole village knows this.

81
00:09:12,296 --> 00:09:14,523
Actually, this physician, Babulal.

82
00:09:14,603 --> 00:09:17,680
He instigates people
against you and me.

83
00:09:18,179 --> 00:09:20,818
Why's Babulal jealous of you?

84
00:09:21,461 --> 00:09:23,589
I don't like that.

85
00:09:23,988 --> 00:09:27,090
I sell quinine to the villagers..

86
00:09:27,435 --> 00:09:30,834
No one takes medicines
from the poor guy.

87
00:09:31,145 --> 00:09:32,720
This is it.

88
00:09:34,835 --> 00:09:37,863
Hey?
How's your daughter?

89
00:09:38,384 --> 00:09:41,504
You took the medicine that day.
Why didn't you come again?

90
00:09:42,073 --> 00:09:45,055
Physician,
your medicine didn't have any effect.

91
00:09:45,609 --> 00:09:47,983
She quickly recovered
with Mohanlal's medicine.

92
00:09:48,344 --> 00:09:49,344
What?

93
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:54,341
Last 15 generations, my forefathers
have been practicing medicine.

94
00:09:54,752 --> 00:09:58,744
And you say that your
medicine didn't have any effect.

95
00:09:59,706 --> 00:10:01,026
Wait and watch.

96
00:10:01,816 --> 00:10:05,754
If I don't take revenge of this
insult from you and your Mohanlal.

97
00:10:06,182 --> 00:10:08,128
Then, don't call
me physician Babulal.

98
00:10:17,302 --> 00:10:21,275
"Raddish from the field
and mango from the orchard."

99
00:10:21,355 --> 00:10:25,345
"I am a boy, you are the price."

100
00:10:25,572 --> 00:10:29,226
"Raddish from the field
and mango from the orchard."

101
00:10:29,531 --> 00:10:33,654
"I am a boy, you are the price."

102
00:10:37,435 --> 00:10:41,167
"The clouds of rain."

103
00:10:41,247 --> 00:10:45,292
"Don't be careless about me."

104
00:10:49,258 --> 00:10:53,056
"Eye kohl at evening."

105
00:10:53,136 --> 00:10:57,139
"In the night it looks
like kohl in the eyes."

106
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:04,696
"A mould of jaggery."

107
00:11:04,776 --> 00:11:08,545
"Stays together like
Bela and jasmine."

108
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:12,134
"A mould of jaggery."

109
00:11:12,498 --> 00:11:16,288
"Stays together like
Bela and jasmine."

110
00:11:19,994 --> 00:11:23,716
"Raddish from the field
and mango from the orchard."

111
00:11:23,796 --> 00:11:27,952
"I am a boy, you are the price."

112
00:11:33,212 --> 00:11:34,453
The train's coming.

113
00:11:34,973 --> 00:11:36,920
Go, close the gate.

114
00:11:37,837 --> 00:11:38,837
Yes, go.

115
00:11:38,901 --> 00:11:40,380
I too will go to the shop.

116
00:12:07,401 --> 00:12:08,963
Pratap's mother.

117
00:12:09,797 --> 00:12:11,889
Hey, Pratap's mother.

118
00:12:13,569 --> 00:12:15,441
Who?
Rambi's daughter-in-law?

119
00:12:15,738 --> 00:12:17,720
Yes. I touch your feet.

120
00:12:17,889 --> 00:12:20,568
May your husband live long.
May you bear a son.

121
00:12:20,648 --> 00:12:21,763
What brings you here?

122
00:12:22,036 --> 00:12:24,185
Nanu's mother has called you.

123
00:12:24,265 --> 00:12:26,474
Guests are coming
to their house tomorrow.

124
00:12:26,554 --> 00:12:28,447
There's a lot of
work to be done today.

125
00:12:28,527 --> 00:12:30,359
Even I have lots of work to do.

126
00:12:30,601 --> 00:12:32,592
I haven't wrapped up
the morning work yet.

127
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:35,789
Anyways, you go.
I'll wrap up and come.

128
00:12:36,926 --> 00:12:38,495
Have they called someone else?

129
00:12:38,575 --> 00:12:40,609
Yes, yes.
They've called everyone.

130
00:12:40,689 --> 00:12:42,878
There's a lot of work.
Grinding flour.

131
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:45,557
Grains are to be cleaned.
Rice is to be beaten.

132
00:12:58,373 --> 00:12:59,642
Kasturi.

133
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:03,286
Hey, Kasturi.

134
00:13:03,751 --> 00:13:05,400
Hey, where are you?

135
00:13:05,627 --> 00:13:06,988
Coming, father.

136
00:13:07,473 --> 00:13:08,577
I'll be back.

137
00:13:11,454 --> 00:13:12,966
Where were you all this while?

138
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:16,277
You won't say.

139
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:18,279
Dumb girl.

140
00:13:21,011 --> 00:13:25,732
Here you go. Bring some flour
and pulses from uncle Mohan's shop.

141
00:13:27,251 --> 00:13:29,131
Should I tell you where I was?

142
00:13:29,588 --> 00:13:32,913
I was roaming in the car with Pratap.

143
00:13:34,205 --> 00:13:38,602
Hey? God has given
me such a naughty daughter.

144
00:13:39,699 --> 00:13:42,243
I need to find a groom for her soon.

145
00:13:43,973 --> 00:13:45,960
I've found one.

146
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:49,181
Is it?

147
00:13:59,634 --> 00:14:00,822
Child.

148
00:14:01,913 --> 00:14:04,096
You're not so lucky.

149
00:14:06,439 --> 00:14:07,489
Why?

150
00:14:09,425 --> 00:14:13,562
You'll get married
to a guy of my choice.

151
00:14:14,361 --> 00:14:16,905
Don't you like Pratap?

152
00:14:18,138 --> 00:14:21,094
Do it, father. Chose him.

153
00:14:22,167 --> 00:14:26,135
You need a witch like
mother-in-law to control you.

154
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:29,981
Pratap's mother is very simple.

155
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:41,556
"River, flow slowly.
Flow slowly, I am entering."

156
00:14:41,636 --> 00:14:46,874
"River, flow slowly.
Flow slowly, I am entering."

157
00:14:53,978 --> 00:15:01,005
"Why your boat and why your sail?"

158
00:15:01,085 --> 00:15:07,956
"Why your boat and why your sail?"

159
00:15:13,183 --> 00:15:18,345
"Which sailor of yours
will take me to the other side?"

160
00:15:18,425 --> 00:15:24,075
"Which sailor of yours
will take me to the other side?"

161
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:34,215
"River, flow slowly.
Flow slowly, I am entering,"

162
00:15:34,295 --> 00:15:39,438
"River, flow slowly.
Flow slowly, I am entering,"

163
00:15:46,373 --> 00:15:53,341
"My boat sails, the sail flutters."

164
00:15:53,421 --> 00:16:00,281
"My boat sails, the sail flutters."

165
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:10,821
"True my boat,
my sailor, I want to cross over."

166
00:16:10,901 --> 00:16:16,366
"True my boat,
my sailor, I want to cross over."

167
00:16:21,253 --> 00:16:26,495
"River, flow slowly.
Flow slowly, I am entering,"

168
00:16:26,575 --> 00:16:31,944
"River, flow slowly.
Flow slowly, I am entering,"

169
00:16:42,988 --> 00:16:45,275
How's your son today?

170
00:16:45,513 --> 00:16:48,331
The fever is not there,
but there's a lot of weakness.

171
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:50,600
Brother, it's Malaria.

172
00:16:51,435 --> 00:16:52,678
It takes a toll.

173
00:16:54,144 --> 00:16:56,409
Are you giving him quinine everyday?

174
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:00,072
His mother went to the physician.

175
00:17:00,462 --> 00:17:02,575
He stopped quinine.

176
00:17:02,655 --> 00:17:04,261
And started other medicine.

177
00:17:04,882 --> 00:17:06,294
Now suffer.

178
00:17:06,828 --> 00:17:09,120
I gave you quinine for free.

179
00:17:09,626 --> 00:17:13,426
But you're not satisfied
without filling Babulal's pockets.

180
00:17:14,253 --> 00:17:15,673
She went.

181
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:19,469
The physician said that sickness
is not cured without spending money.

182
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:22,248
Don't fall for his words.

183
00:17:23,048 --> 00:17:26,921
There's no better medicine
than quinine for Malaria.

184
00:17:47,883 --> 00:17:49,504
Take. Take one more dose.

185
00:17:50,773 --> 00:17:52,039
Go and give him.

186
00:17:58,925 --> 00:18:00,371
Give me massage oil.

187
00:18:22,302 --> 00:18:23,503
Just this much?

188
00:18:24,142 --> 00:18:25,290
How much more?

189
00:18:25,657 --> 00:18:27,587
Should I pour the whole tin?

190
00:18:28,551 --> 00:18:30,412
Okay, give me at least little more.

191
00:18:31,395 --> 00:18:33,395
Do you want little more?

192
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:45,622
Give me a drop for my head.

193
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:50,424
Here you go.

194
00:18:50,877 --> 00:18:54,270
But don't use it
on this marble terrace.

195
00:18:54,745 --> 00:18:57,168
Massage it on the body.
It will show result.

196
00:18:57,457 --> 00:18:58,960
Am I a monkey..

197
00:18:59,736 --> 00:19:02,083
To massage oil on
the body and grow hair?

198
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:05,514
Wow!
You're just like that.

199
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,510
Does oil massage
give hair or strength?

200
00:19:11,111 --> 00:19:12,411
Go and get an oil massage.

201
00:19:12,491 --> 00:19:14,385
Sleep on tamarind leaves.

202
00:19:14,571 --> 00:19:16,016
Enough, Mohanlal.

203
00:19:16,436 --> 00:19:17,938
Mind your tongue.

204
00:19:18,606 --> 00:19:21,801
Physician Babulal was right,
that you're a fraud.

205
00:19:23,107 --> 00:19:25,572
You like to take others money.

206
00:19:25,993 --> 00:19:28,089
And bothering to give stuff.

207
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:30,705
Dishonest.

208
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:41,262
Where's Pratap?

209
00:19:42,116 --> 00:19:44,093
He doesn't help me in anything.

210
00:19:44,348 --> 00:19:47,262
He' still young.
Must be playing somewhere.

211
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:55,323
Stop.

212
00:20:05,345 --> 00:20:07,709
Go, go to the shop.
I'll unload the stock.

213
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:09,780
No, no.
We'll go together.

214
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:12,176
Come, let's quickly
take down the stock.

215
00:20:12,256 --> 00:20:14,913
Come on. You won't unload.
This is men's task.

216
00:20:15,115 --> 00:20:17,630
Is it? Let me see.

217
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:21,710
Enough.

218
00:20:22,248 --> 00:20:23,608
I told you, but who'll understand.

219
00:20:24,126 --> 00:20:25,901
Come on, you pick up the sack.

220
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:28,042
This is women's task.

221
00:20:46,837 --> 00:20:49,106
You are too lenient with Pratap.

222
00:20:50,334 --> 00:20:53,063
He must be sitting and
chatting with that Kasturi.

223
00:20:54,188 --> 00:20:55,689
Did you forget those days..

224
00:20:56,789 --> 00:21:00,592
When like Pratap and Kasturi,
in childhood..

225
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:03,709
Jumped around the well all day?

226
00:21:05,071 --> 00:21:06,591
It was different with us.

227
00:21:07,529 --> 00:21:09,107
You and me belonged to the same caste.

228
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:11,874
Kasturi and Pratap?

229
00:21:13,565 --> 00:21:15,234
God forbid!

230
00:21:15,779 --> 00:21:16,779
Hey.

231
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,477
25 paise have come.

232
00:21:29,632 --> 00:21:32,428
What will you do with money?
Take groceries.

233
00:21:32,712 --> 00:21:35,498
I don't want groceries.
I want money.

234
00:21:38,212 --> 00:21:39,425
Good.

235
00:21:44,562 --> 00:21:45,562
Here you go.

236
00:21:54,426 --> 00:21:55,867
Give me 25 paise.

237
00:22:00,191 --> 00:22:02,597
Don't worry.
You must have forgotten it somewhere.

238
00:22:02,677 --> 00:22:04,055
Yes, left it somewhere.

239
00:22:04,439 --> 00:22:08,381
Let it be, if it's left.
Give it later.

240
00:22:08,461 --> 00:22:11,160
Brother, no matter what
physician Babulal says.

241
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:14,872
No person in the entire
village is as kind as you.

242
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:17,286
Let him talk.

243
00:22:18,103 --> 00:22:19,589
Do you know..

244
00:22:20,045 --> 00:22:22,166
What the ancient
wise people have written?

245
00:22:22,246 --> 00:22:25,857
Hey, for me a black alphabet
resembles a buffalo.

246
00:22:25,937 --> 00:22:26,938
You tell.

247
00:22:27,106 --> 00:22:28,490
They've written.

248
00:22:28,813 --> 00:22:31,976
He who has intelligence also
has the capability to understand.

249
00:22:32,634 --> 00:22:33,656
It's right.

250
00:22:34,192 --> 00:22:36,556
You have both intelligence
and the capability to understand.

251
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,872
Where were you, Pratap?

252
00:22:45,501 --> 00:22:46,803
He was with me.

253
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,716
All right.
All right.

254
00:22:49,049 --> 00:22:50,049
Fine.

255
00:22:51,146 --> 00:22:52,331
But, Pratap.

256
00:22:53,118 --> 00:22:54,609
Now you've grown up.

257
00:22:55,594 --> 00:22:58,370
You should support your old parents.

258
00:23:06,677 --> 00:23:09,353
Kasturi, what will you have, child?

259
00:23:10,393 --> 00:23:12,672
Groceries for today's meal.

260
00:23:13,524 --> 00:23:14,971
Flour, pulses.

261
00:23:15,584 --> 00:23:17,420
Clarified butter, rice, salt.

262
00:23:18,155 --> 00:23:19,167
Oh!

263
00:23:20,274 --> 00:23:21,950
You have just 1 paise in the knot.

264
00:23:22,436 --> 00:23:25,118
But the queen shows such attitude.

265
00:23:25,561 --> 00:23:27,647
As if she'll buy the whole shop.

266
00:23:33,069 --> 00:23:34,765
What will you buy in 1 paise?

267
00:23:34,845 --> 00:23:35,944
How would I know?

268
00:23:36,261 --> 00:23:39,199
It's your shop.
Give me whatever you can.

269
00:23:39,455 --> 00:23:41,543
I just know to cook food.

270
00:23:41,889 --> 00:23:43,963
Look at her.

271
00:23:44,494 --> 00:23:47,101
What all can you cook?

272
00:23:47,302 --> 00:23:49,644
If you don't believe, ask father.

273
00:23:49,983 --> 00:23:51,221
Yes.

274
00:23:51,544 --> 00:23:53,655
He'll praise you.

275
00:23:53,735 --> 00:23:55,922
All right, ask Pratap.

276
00:23:56,128 --> 00:23:58,933
He too has eaten
the food cooked by me.

277
00:24:03,296 --> 00:24:04,393
Pratap?

278
00:24:06,085 --> 00:24:07,318
Pratap?

279
00:24:13,275 --> 00:24:15,545
Did you eat food cooked by Kasturi?

280
00:24:19,729 --> 00:24:22,079
She cooks good food, mother.

281
00:24:23,058 --> 00:24:25,050
Answer what I ask.

282
00:24:26,238 --> 00:24:29,328
Did you eat food cooked by her or no?

283
00:24:30,728 --> 00:24:32,596
I did eat, mother.

284
00:24:34,262 --> 00:24:35,949
Have you lost it?

285
00:24:37,552 --> 00:24:39,892
Being the son of a Brahmin,
you eat food cooked by her?

286
00:24:41,544 --> 00:24:43,656
Mother, don't get angry.

287
00:24:44,105 --> 00:24:46,090
I won't give him food in the future.

288
00:24:49,972 --> 00:24:52,378
Child, go and cook food.

289
00:24:52,709 --> 00:24:54,479
Father must be hungry.

290
00:25:06,455 --> 00:25:07,377
Pratap.

291
00:25:07,457 --> 00:25:11,441
Mother, I swear.
I won't let him eat ever.

292
00:25:11,521 --> 00:25:15,516
Pratap, go.
Deliver this stuff to Kasturi's house.

293
00:25:15,766 --> 00:25:17,598
Come back soon for the meal.

294
00:25:22,048 --> 00:25:23,618
He's still a kid.

295
00:25:24,011 --> 00:25:26,337
Let him play for some more days.

296
00:25:26,417 --> 00:25:28,138
Will they remain kids all their life?

297
00:25:28,895 --> 00:25:30,590
Now they've become
of marriageable age.

298
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:33,430
Yes. They'll make a good pair.

299
00:25:33,655 --> 00:25:34,655
What?

300
00:25:34,774 --> 00:25:39,251
Yes, I said.
If Kasturi belonged to our caste.

301
00:25:39,389 --> 00:25:41,291
She would have been
so good for Pratap.

302
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:43,375
If she was.

303
00:25:44,286 --> 00:25:45,987
But she's the daughter
of an untouchable.

304
00:25:46,575 --> 00:25:48,439
I don't like them meeting each other.

305
00:25:48,848 --> 00:25:50,078
You're right.

306
00:25:50,897 --> 00:25:53,329
They are too attached to each other.

307
00:25:54,834 --> 00:25:57,173
Anyways, there's still time.

308
00:25:58,307 --> 00:26:00,728
We'll find a girl for Pratap.

309
00:26:01,318 --> 00:26:03,039
And tell Dukhiya..

310
00:26:03,206 --> 00:26:05,146
To find a groom for Kasturi as well.

311
00:26:14,067 --> 00:26:15,686
I'll keep this and be right back.

312
00:27:12,538 --> 00:27:20,294
"I'll become a sparrow of
the forest and sing in the forest."

313
00:27:20,374 --> 00:27:28,173
"I'll become a bird of
the forest and dance with you."

314
00:27:28,253 --> 00:27:35,844
"I'll become a sparrow of
the forest and sing in the forest."

315
00:27:35,924 --> 00:27:43,441
"I'll become a bird of
the forest and dance with you."

316
00:27:55,538 --> 00:27:59,355
"I'll fly from one branch to another."

317
00:27:59,435 --> 00:28:03,221
"I won't come in your hands."

318
00:28:03,301 --> 00:28:07,120
"I'll fly from one branch to another."

319
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,022
"I won't come in your hands."

320
00:28:11,102 --> 00:28:18,149
"You on branches, I on leaves."
"I'll definitely catch you."

321
00:28:18,229 --> 00:28:22,077
"I'll dance with you."

322
00:28:22,523 --> 00:28:29,462
"You on branches, I on leaves."
"I'll definitely catch you."

323
00:28:29,542 --> 00:28:33,266
"I'll dance with you."

324
00:28:33,346 --> 00:28:36,932
"I'll sing in the forest."

325
00:28:37,619 --> 00:28:44,758
"I'll become a sparrow of
the forest and sing in the forest."

326
00:28:45,081 --> 00:28:52,111
"I'll become a bird of
the forest and dance with you."

327
00:28:52,733 --> 00:28:59,614
"I'll become a sparrow of
the forest and sing in the forest."

328
00:28:59,751 --> 00:29:03,393
"I'll dance with you."

329
00:29:11,098 --> 00:29:13,540
Babulal, did you hear this?

330
00:29:13,827 --> 00:29:17,176
Mohanlal said that
you don't know medicine.

331
00:29:19,401 --> 00:29:20,639
Ashes in his mouth.

332
00:29:22,537 --> 00:29:28,221
My forefathers have been practicing
medicine for the last 15 generations.

333
00:29:28,719 --> 00:29:31,296
And, I don't understand medicine?

334
00:29:32,303 --> 00:29:37,257
Mohan has become a doctor
by storing a 2 1/2 pill of quinine.

335
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:39,867
Anyways, kid.

336
00:29:40,101 --> 00:29:45,636
If I don't make you forget medicine,
my name is not physician Babulal.

337
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:13,683
You have fever.

338
00:30:14,633 --> 00:30:17,636
Hey, no.
I don't have fever.

339
00:30:18,511 --> 00:30:20,661
No fever.

340
00:30:21,474 --> 00:30:24,514
If you don't have fever
why are you wailing?

341
00:30:24,956 --> 00:30:27,146
I say, you have fever.

342
00:30:27,955 --> 00:30:32,264
Hey, haven't.
How do I believe?

343
00:30:32,769 --> 00:30:34,459
You'll not believe like this.

344
00:30:35,813 --> 00:30:37,914
Are you the physician or me?

345
00:30:38,951 --> 00:30:43,057
If I've said that you have fever,
the fever has to be there.

346
00:30:44,268 --> 00:30:50,758
My forefathers have been practicing
medicine for the last 15 generations.

347
00:30:53,424 --> 00:30:56,237
One feels cold before getting fever.

348
00:30:56,410 --> 00:30:59,332
But I am not feeling cold at all.

349
00:31:00,266 --> 00:31:04,379
Tell me. How do I make
these illiterate understand?

350
00:31:06,168 --> 00:31:09,475
That's why Mohan has the courage..

351
00:31:09,555 --> 00:31:12,995
To consider these people as fools.

352
00:31:13,336 --> 00:31:17,132
Hey, but I haven't gone to Mohanlal.

353
00:31:17,622 --> 00:31:19,033
Good, you're saved.

354
00:31:19,665 --> 00:31:22,940
Or else he would've said
that you don't have fever.

355
00:31:24,306 --> 00:31:29,409
But, physician Babulal doesn't
know how to agree with the patients.

356
00:31:30,486 --> 00:31:34,661
Yes, so. For how many days
have you been getting fever?

357
00:31:34,741 --> 00:31:37,029
Physician, I am telling you.

358
00:31:37,109 --> 00:31:38,817
I don't have fever.

359
00:31:39,116 --> 00:31:41,099
I don't feel cold.

360
00:31:41,179 --> 00:31:43,451
When did I say that
you're feeling cold?

361
00:31:44,324 --> 00:31:46,480
Does one feel cold or hot in fever?

362
00:31:46,663 --> 00:31:48,950
Hey, but I don't feel hot either.

363
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:50,030
Huh?

364
00:31:51,049 --> 00:31:53,393
You are in a scary state.

365
00:31:54,643 --> 00:31:57,932
You neither feel hot nor cold.

366
00:31:58,969 --> 00:32:01,050
Then, what do you feel?

367
00:32:02,273 --> 00:32:03,420
Let me see.

368
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:07,142
Show me your stomach.
Stomach.

369
00:32:07,222 --> 00:32:10,231
Physician, how did you come to know..

370
00:32:10,311 --> 00:32:12,454
That there is pain in my stomach?

371
00:32:21,225 --> 00:32:22,225
Stomach?

372
00:32:23,464 --> 00:32:27,072
I can even tell the
condition of your heart.

373
00:32:28,926 --> 00:32:32,858
My name is physician Babulal.

374
00:32:34,034 --> 00:32:40,255
My forefathers have been practicing
medicine for the last 15 generations.

375
00:32:41,282 --> 00:32:45,118
I found out as soon
as I saw your face..

376
00:32:45,375 --> 00:32:47,988
That you have a stomach fever.

377
00:32:49,233 --> 00:32:50,429
You're right, brother.

378
00:32:51,099 --> 00:32:54,889
The girl has grown up.
I should get her married now.

379
00:32:55,072 --> 00:32:58,342
Yes.
We are getting Pratap also married.

380
00:32:59,026 --> 00:33:01,064
His mother has gone to meet a girl.

381
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:04,891
With God's grace,
Pratap will get many proposals.

382
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:08,811
But, who'll marry Kasturi
without any dowry?

383
00:33:11,337 --> 00:33:12,963
You don't worry about that.

384
00:33:14,113 --> 00:33:16,586
Whatever dowry Pratap gets..

385
00:33:16,879 --> 00:33:18,786
We'll give it in Kasturi's marriage.

386
00:33:19,001 --> 00:33:21,622
Hey, brother.
How's this possible?

387
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:25,060
I can't forget your past favors.

388
00:33:25,474 --> 00:33:26,873
Forget that.

389
00:33:27,189 --> 00:33:28,731
But, remember.

390
00:33:29,196 --> 00:33:32,840
The way Kasturi is your daughter,
she is mine as well.

391
00:33:34,062 --> 00:33:35,859
I'll get her married.

392
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:40,515
Did you hear?
The other day.

393
00:33:41,768 --> 00:33:44,501
I was telling Pratap's mother.

394
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:48,487
Kasturi and Pratap make a good couple.

395
00:33:51,553 --> 00:33:56,143
Dukhiya, it would have been better if
both of us belonged to the same caste.

396
00:33:57,604 --> 00:33:58,604
Yes, brother.

397
00:33:59,705 --> 00:34:02,115
Both of them can die for each other.

398
00:34:02,663 --> 00:34:04,056
I know.

399
00:34:04,924 --> 00:34:08,259
Since Pratap's mother
told him not to meet..

400
00:34:08,674 --> 00:34:10,365
Both of them are restless.

401
00:34:11,248 --> 00:34:15,750
Kasturi comes to see Pratap
on some or the other pretext everyday.

402
00:34:16,601 --> 00:34:20,526
But the poor girl returns
scaring his mother.

403
00:34:23,425 --> 00:34:27,513
Mother says that it's not
good for us to play together.

404
00:34:30,382 --> 00:34:32,440
She says that we're not kids anymore.

405
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,414
There was nothing
wrong with the childhood.

406
00:34:35,507 --> 00:34:38,282
What's wrong if we play together now?

407
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:42,331
Does one have to find
new friends on growing up?

408
00:34:44,217 --> 00:34:48,288
When I'll grow up, I won't
have to follow mother's orders.

409
00:34:50,112 --> 00:34:52,990
And then we can continue
playing together.

410
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:54,176
No, no.

411
00:34:55,221 --> 00:34:58,763
Even after growing up, you'll
have to follow your mother's orders.

412
00:34:58,843 --> 00:35:02,247
Why?
Father didn't listen to granny either.

413
00:35:02,716 --> 00:35:04,409
She used to stop him a lot.

414
00:35:04,748 --> 00:35:07,836
But father never stopped giving
groceries to the people on credit.

415
00:35:08,251 --> 00:35:12,163
She didn't even like your
father and my father meeting.

416
00:35:12,522 --> 00:35:14,215
- And.
- We're untouchables.

417
00:35:15,833 --> 00:35:17,579
Everyone thinks that we are bad.

418
00:35:17,717 --> 00:35:19,171
Not everyone, Kasturi.

419
00:35:19,526 --> 00:35:22,783
Father mingles with
father all the time.

420
00:35:23,541 --> 00:35:26,897
Yes, but now we won't
be able to mingle anymore.

421
00:35:27,521 --> 00:35:29,390
Everyone says the girl is good.

422
00:35:30,081 --> 00:35:33,062
Good and bad is known after testing.

423
00:35:33,142 --> 00:35:36,710
Now you need to check how she looks.

424
00:35:36,925 --> 00:35:41,096
Yes, if the daughter-in-law is pretty,
Pratap will forget Kasturi.

425
00:36:20,603 --> 00:36:23,605
Come, child.
Will you come to our house?

426
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:26,920
I don't have a daughter.

427
00:36:30,114 --> 00:36:31,685
She's very shy.

428
00:36:32,393 --> 00:36:34,299
My Pratap is also very shy.

429
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,267
They'll make a good couple.

430
00:36:38,387 --> 00:36:39,581
All right.

431
00:36:39,705 --> 00:36:41,709
Now let's discuss the dowry.

432
00:36:42,997 --> 00:36:44,682
I don't want anything.

433
00:36:45,357 --> 00:36:47,280
I am getting my son married.

434
00:36:47,989 --> 00:36:50,090
I am not trading him for anything.

435
00:36:50,523 --> 00:36:52,894
You can give whatever you want,
to your daughter.

436
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:04,385
Meera?

437
00:37:04,712 --> 00:37:06,544
Are you getting married?

438
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:11,618
With God's grace,
your husband shouldn't be like mine.

439
00:37:12,706 --> 00:37:15,329
He doesn't even come near me.

440
00:37:20,761 --> 00:37:22,610
I'll go and live in their house.

441
00:37:23,516 --> 00:37:29,040
But, your parents want your husband to
be a son-in-law who stays with them.

442
00:37:37,308 --> 00:37:42,389
Child. Things change with time.

443
00:37:43,553 --> 00:37:46,076
What you did childhood,
can't be done now.

444
00:37:46,891 --> 00:37:49,324
What you do now,
you may not do in the future.

445
00:37:52,786 --> 00:37:54,196
Father.

446
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:58,206
One can't lose childhood friends.

447
00:37:59,731 --> 00:38:01,186
You are the one who said.

448
00:38:02,153 --> 00:38:04,779
Either you don't make
friends with anyone.

449
00:38:05,403 --> 00:38:09,079
Or, if you do,
then stay true to it till the end.

450
00:38:26,148 --> 00:38:29,100
Playing together was
not wrong in childhood.

451
00:38:29,945 --> 00:38:31,605
How did it become now?

452
00:38:36,543 --> 00:38:39,014
Who'll argue with you?

453
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,652
I don't argue, father.

454
00:38:45,195 --> 00:38:47,053
I want to know.

455
00:38:54,233 --> 00:38:56,197
Don't you hear, father?

456
00:38:56,599 --> 00:38:57,999
I do, child.

457
00:39:04,737 --> 00:39:08,009
Then, tell me.
Answer me.

458
00:39:08,906 --> 00:39:13,690
God has given you birth
in the house of an untouchable.

459
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:17,528
And, Pratap in a Brahmin's house.

460
00:39:20,738 --> 00:39:23,146
Then, why should we lost
our friendship because of this?

461
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:25,432
Child.

462
00:39:26,098 --> 00:39:27,637
This is a society.

463
00:39:28,424 --> 00:39:31,397
Here you get both joys and sorrows.

464
00:39:32,669 --> 00:39:35,628
A person should not give up.

465
00:39:37,612 --> 00:39:40,554
Time takes away all the sorrows.

466
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:49,498
Now we have lot of evidence.

467
00:39:51,041 --> 00:39:54,921
Let's call a village court and
throw that Mohanlal out of our caste.

468
00:39:56,361 --> 00:39:57,776
He was being so smart.

469
00:39:58,031 --> 00:40:01,309
But physician.
The village court will ask for proof.

470
00:40:01,389 --> 00:40:02,766
Yes.

471
00:40:02,846 --> 00:40:04,624
I've heard it with my ears.

472
00:40:04,704 --> 00:40:07,288
Mohan's son ate food
at Dukhiya's house.

473
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:09,508
Yes, you heard but did you see?

474
00:40:09,862 --> 00:40:10,923
Yes.

475
00:40:11,051 --> 00:40:12,422
I saw.

476
00:40:12,502 --> 00:40:16,899
Mohan has fixed his son's
marriage to Kasturi in front of me.

477
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:19,677
This is a proper evidence.

478
00:40:20,661 --> 00:40:23,288
Let the marriage take place first.
Then you say.

479
00:40:23,986 --> 00:40:25,307
Yes.

480
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:30,271
Mohan has taken you on his side
by giving you free quinine, hasn't he?

481
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:31,998
I am not on any side.

482
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:34,015
I am friends with him as well as you.

483
00:40:34,095 --> 00:40:35,484
I don't have enmity with anyone.

484
00:40:35,926 --> 00:40:37,454
But, I do.

485
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:42,099
- That day Mohan called me a monkey.
- What?

486
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,442
I'll teach him a lesson.

487
00:40:44,649 --> 00:40:49,140
And that day, when I gave
him 25 paise and asked for change..

488
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:51,424
He started calling
me an owl and a donkey.

489
00:40:51,653 --> 00:40:55,461
If I don't take a revenge for this,
my name is not Ghasita.

490
00:40:56,463 --> 00:41:01,320
And my name is also not physician
Babulal if I don't kill his ego.

491
00:41:04,684 --> 00:41:08,621
My last 15 generations of forefathers.

492
00:41:13,607 --> 00:41:15,526
You hear it from this ear or that.

493
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:19,934
I won't agree without taking
any dowry in Pratap's marriage.

494
00:41:20,785 --> 00:41:22,972
You'll take when you get it.

495
00:41:23,506 --> 00:41:25,439
I've refused those people.

496
00:41:25,519 --> 00:41:27,023
No matter how much you refuse.

497
00:41:27,781 --> 00:41:29,705
I'll take dowry.

498
00:41:30,093 --> 00:41:33,108
Why?
To give these poor villagers?

499
00:41:33,622 --> 00:41:36,209
Not to give to these poor villagers.

500
00:41:36,789 --> 00:41:38,719
In fact, for Dukhiya's daughter.

501
00:41:39,251 --> 00:41:40,613
Then say that..

502
00:41:40,942 --> 00:41:44,046
You're more worried for
Dukhiya's daughter than your own son.

503
00:41:44,354 --> 00:41:45,814
Poor Dukhiya.

504
00:41:46,084 --> 00:41:48,759
He's my only companion
in joys and sorrows.

505
00:41:50,373 --> 00:41:52,351
All right. I am saying.

506
00:41:52,916 --> 00:41:55,199
You won't get dowry
in Pratap's marriage.

507
00:41:55,448 --> 00:41:56,952
And, I also tell you.

508
00:41:57,244 --> 00:41:58,987
I will and surely will.

509
00:41:59,125 --> 00:42:01,149
Or else the marriage
will not take place.

510
00:42:01,468 --> 00:42:03,090
Am I his mother or you?

511
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:04,888
Am I his father or you?

512
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:08,919
I've refused them.

513
00:42:09,052 --> 00:42:11,374
And I've promised Dukhiya.

514
00:42:14,048 --> 00:42:15,409
Great.

515
00:42:16,131 --> 00:42:19,908
Whatever jewellery I have,
I'll give it in Kasturi's marriage.

516
00:42:21,998 --> 00:42:26,547
"Where have you gone, sailer?"

517
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:31,520
"Where have you gone, sailer?"

518
00:42:31,782 --> 00:42:37,187
"Where have you gone, sailer?"

519
00:42:37,587 --> 00:42:42,723
"The boat sinks."

520
00:42:42,803 --> 00:42:46,882
"The boat sinks."

521
00:42:46,962 --> 00:42:51,976
"Where have you gone, sailer?"

522
00:42:52,056 --> 00:42:56,916
"Where have you gone, sailer?"

523
00:42:56,996 --> 00:43:03,457
"Where have you gone, sailer?"

524
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:12,700
"Had I known this."

525
00:43:17,782 --> 00:43:25,782
"Love gives this pain."

526
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:34,570
"But I'm saying to everyone."

527
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:46,700
"No one would have fallen in love."

528
00:43:49,251 --> 00:43:54,547
"He has left me in troubled times."

529
00:43:54,627 --> 00:43:59,996
"He has left me in troubled times."

530
00:44:00,076 --> 00:44:05,828
"He has left me in troubled times."

531
00:44:06,039 --> 00:44:11,334
"The boat sinks."

532
00:44:11,414 --> 00:44:15,860
"The boat sinks."

533
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:21,173
"Where have you gone, sailer?"

534
00:44:21,253 --> 00:44:26,117
"Where have you gone, sailer?"

535
00:44:26,197 --> 00:44:32,146
"Where have you gone, sailer?"

536
00:44:41,985 --> 00:44:46,802
"My friends have separated from me."

537
00:44:46,882 --> 00:44:51,736
"The boatman, my life partner."

538
00:44:51,816 --> 00:44:56,579
"My friends have separated from me."

539
00:44:56,659 --> 00:45:01,678
"The boatman, my life partner."

540
00:45:01,758 --> 00:45:06,666
"The boatman, my life partner."

541
00:45:13,285 --> 00:45:17,507
"Who'll take it to the coast?"

542
00:45:17,587 --> 00:45:22,384
"Who'll take it to the coast?"

543
00:45:22,464 --> 00:45:28,080
"Who'll take it to the coast?"

544
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:33,377
"The boat sinks."

545
00:45:33,457 --> 00:45:37,658
"The boat sinks."

546
00:45:37,738 --> 00:45:42,397
"Where have you gone, sailer?"

547
00:45:42,477 --> 00:45:47,599
"Where have you gone, sailer?"

548
00:45:47,679 --> 00:45:53,804
"Where have you gone, sailer?"

549
00:45:55,523 --> 00:45:56,734
Kasturi.

550
00:45:58,317 --> 00:46:00,763
- Did you get scared?
- No.

551
00:46:02,246 --> 00:46:04,263
Have you come with
the wedding invitation?

552
00:46:05,809 --> 00:46:08,203
Whether you invite me or not.
I'll definitely come.

553
00:46:08,747 --> 00:46:11,222
Mother and father have
taken up the task of inviting.

554
00:46:11,302 --> 00:46:12,342
All right.

555
00:46:12,553 --> 00:46:14,808
- Will you go to your in-laws place tomorrow?
- Yes.

556
00:46:16,027 --> 00:46:19,068
I feel like accompanying
you to see the daughter-in-law.

557
00:46:20,551 --> 00:46:21,568
How's she?

558
00:46:22,243 --> 00:46:23,924
I haven't seen her yet.

559
00:46:24,841 --> 00:46:26,826
Mother must have told you.

560
00:46:28,424 --> 00:46:30,715
Kasturi, wouldn't it be better..

561
00:46:30,963 --> 00:46:33,871
If you also got married with me?

562
00:46:34,789 --> 00:46:36,364
I will.

563
00:46:36,746 --> 00:46:39,937
May God give you a good groom.

564
00:46:41,717 --> 00:46:45,167
May Lord Rama give you a good wife.

565
00:47:00,705 --> 00:47:01,914
Kasturi.

566
00:47:03,550 --> 00:47:06,259
7 Down, train is coming.

567
00:47:08,083 --> 00:47:11,572
I can't stand.

568
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:15,660
You go and wave the flag.

569
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:13,408
Where's your father?

570
00:49:13,877 --> 00:49:15,398
Won't he see the daughter-in-law?

571
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:18,107
He's lying sick.
He can't even sit.

572
00:49:19,161 --> 00:49:20,810
I would like to see him.

573
00:49:36,451 --> 00:49:38,078
She's so pretty.

574
00:49:41,514 --> 00:49:46,008
How will poor
Kasturi look after you?

575
00:49:46,843 --> 00:49:48,374
You come to my house.

576
00:49:53,238 --> 00:49:55,318
Will you make me your friend?

577
00:49:56,362 --> 00:49:58,022
Yes, why not?

578
00:50:04,651 --> 00:50:08,130
Child, I am taking
Dukhiya to my house.

579
00:50:09,091 --> 00:50:11,126
He needs proper care.

580
00:50:12,482 --> 00:50:14,832
You'll mange the work here, will you?

581
00:50:15,125 --> 00:50:19,246
Yes. But how'll I stay
alone without father?

582
00:50:19,326 --> 00:50:23,031
Don't be scared, child. Your father
will get well and come back soon.

583
00:50:23,707 --> 00:50:26,907
And when you feel scared, come there.

584
00:50:27,644 --> 00:50:29,512
Come on, hurry up.
Hurry up.

585
00:51:36,488 --> 00:51:37,488
Child.

586
00:51:38,997 --> 00:51:39,997
Look.

587
00:51:50,192 --> 00:51:53,044
Closing the gate..

588
00:51:53,637 --> 00:51:56,455
And giving the signal..

589
00:51:56,973 --> 00:51:58,561
It shouldn't go wrong.

590
00:51:59,812 --> 00:52:05,867
We are responsible
for hundreds of lives.

591
00:52:12,535 --> 00:52:15,245
That's why I am bringing Dukhiya here.

592
00:52:16,715 --> 00:52:19,232
All right.
Poor guy is sick.

593
00:52:19,912 --> 00:52:22,052
Untouchables are also humans.

594
00:52:22,687 --> 00:52:26,709
Then, we don't have to eat with him.

595
00:52:27,611 --> 00:52:30,396
Kalyani, you're indeed Kalyani.

596
00:52:45,613 --> 00:52:48,145
Wow!
The dice has fallen so well.

597
00:52:48,854 --> 00:52:50,695
Now Mohan is trapped.

598
00:52:51,118 --> 00:52:52,793
Why?
What happened?

599
00:52:53,354 --> 00:52:55,281
Has Mohan got his son married?

600
00:52:55,361 --> 00:52:59,116
Yes, and Dukhiya also brought
an untouchable to his house.

601
00:53:00,898 --> 00:53:03,069
Hey, what are you saying?

602
00:53:04,949 --> 00:53:08,439
Has Mohan made him
stay in his house openly?

603
00:53:09,076 --> 00:53:12,649
Yes.
I've seen with my eyes.

604
00:53:14,185 --> 00:53:17,088
Now the pot of his evils is filled.

605
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:22,369
Let's go. Let's throw
the dirt out of the village.

606
00:54:00,239 --> 00:54:02,794
He calls himself a Brahmin.

607
00:54:03,477 --> 00:54:05,717
Rascal.

608
00:54:06,056 --> 00:54:09,290
He pretends to be a doctor.
Doctor.

609
00:54:36,155 --> 00:54:38,719
We won't tolerate.

610
00:54:39,349 --> 00:54:41,127
Come on.

611
00:54:41,207 --> 00:54:42,463
Throw him out.

612
00:54:42,543 --> 00:54:45,482
Is it true that Dukhiya
is staying in your house?

613
00:54:45,810 --> 00:54:47,892
Yes, what have you got to do with it?

614
00:54:47,972 --> 00:54:49,794
What have you got to do with it?

615
00:54:50,134 --> 00:54:51,697
Throw him out.

616
00:54:53,967 --> 00:54:56,054
Throw him out.

617
00:54:56,134 --> 00:54:57,962
Mohan has made polluted his religion.

618
00:54:58,042 --> 00:55:00,157
We won't let him stay in this village.

619
00:55:14,732 --> 00:55:17,505
And, you've kept a
dirty man in the house.

620
00:55:18,205 --> 00:55:19,829
Do Brahmins do this?

621
00:55:19,909 --> 00:55:22,146
- No, no.
- Throw him out.

622
00:55:22,226 --> 00:55:23,664
- This is not possible.
- Hello.

623
00:55:24,767 --> 00:55:26,344
Am I not a Brahmin?

624
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:29,694
Don't I help the poor?

625
00:55:29,774 --> 00:55:30,774
Yes.

626
00:55:30,853 --> 00:55:33,182
Don't I treat the untouchables?

627
00:55:33,262 --> 00:55:35,169
- Yes.
- I do.

628
00:55:36,144 --> 00:55:38,922
But, I don't make
them sit in my house.

629
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:40,179
Yes, true.

630
00:55:40,259 --> 00:55:41,686
Do you know, why?

631
00:55:41,886 --> 00:55:44,830
Because I am a true Brahmin.

632
00:55:44,910 --> 00:55:46,199
Yes, true.

633
00:55:46,607 --> 00:55:49,084
I believe in my religion.

634
00:55:49,559 --> 00:55:51,552
I have faith and trust.

635
00:55:51,632 --> 00:55:53,360
- Yes, true.
- He's right.

636
00:55:53,515 --> 00:55:57,089
And there's he,
who calls himself a Brahmin.

637
00:55:57,408 --> 00:55:59,688
And makes an untouchable
stay in his house.

638
00:55:59,768 --> 00:56:01,349
- Kill him.
- Kill him.

639
00:56:05,713 --> 00:56:10,504
Throw him out of the house,
society, religion and the village.

640
00:56:16,565 --> 00:56:17,948
Listen, listen.

641
00:56:19,433 --> 00:56:21,511
If you want to throw me out..

642
00:56:22,193 --> 00:56:23,193
Go ahead.

643
00:56:24,542 --> 00:56:26,170
But tell me.

644
00:56:26,984 --> 00:56:28,739
Aren't untouchables humans?

645
00:56:29,481 --> 00:56:33,438
Don't they have life like us
and the feeling of joys and sorrows?

646
00:56:34,826 --> 00:56:35,918
What Brahmin?

647
00:56:36,254 --> 00:56:37,417
What scavenger?

648
00:56:37,589 --> 00:56:39,659
Everyone is the child
of the same father.

649
00:56:43,513 --> 00:56:44,883
Where..

650
00:56:45,070 --> 00:56:46,682
Sun, water.

651
00:56:46,901 --> 00:56:48,363
Air, land.

652
00:56:48,691 --> 00:56:49,998
Is open for everyone.

653
00:56:51,179 --> 00:56:53,662
If God's don't discriminate..

654
00:56:54,215 --> 00:56:58,168
What right do we humans have
to indulge in caste discrimination?

655
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:02,790
You tell me.

656
00:57:03,635 --> 00:57:04,741
You're a physician.

657
00:57:05,909 --> 00:57:09,015
Is the fever of Brahmins
different in medicine?

658
00:57:09,515 --> 00:57:10,988
And different for the untouchables?

659
00:57:12,418 --> 00:57:14,188
Do Brahmins have a different cholera..

660
00:57:14,568 --> 00:57:16,227
And scavengers different?

661
00:57:19,836 --> 00:57:21,855
It's the duty of the man to serve.

662
00:57:23,182 --> 00:57:24,592
Dukhiya is sick.

663
00:57:25,645 --> 00:57:28,477
He needs my care.

664
00:57:28,924 --> 00:57:32,352
Yes.
You're absolutely right.

665
00:57:32,795 --> 00:57:36,534
Entire village needs your care.

666
00:57:36,806 --> 00:57:38,744
Yes.

667
00:57:39,668 --> 00:57:42,438
Whether they need or not,
Dukhiya does.

668
00:57:42,747 --> 00:57:44,565
He is my companion.

669
00:57:44,645 --> 00:57:47,237
Unless he doesn't become all right,
he'll stay here.

670
00:57:47,541 --> 00:57:49,993
This is my personal matter, you don't.

671
00:57:50,073 --> 00:57:51,768
Come on, throw him out.

672
00:57:51,848 --> 00:57:53,162
Listen.

673
00:57:54,075 --> 00:57:56,272
This is his personal matter.

674
00:57:57,648 --> 00:57:59,585
We should not interfere in this.

675
00:58:00,695 --> 00:58:02,951
Our religion is becoming polluted.

676
00:58:03,478 --> 00:58:05,952
Our name is being maligned.

677
00:58:06,032 --> 00:58:08,794
And he says we shouldn't
interfere in this.

678
00:58:08,874 --> 00:58:10,480
Damn you.

679
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:12,048
Yes.

680
00:58:23,499 --> 00:58:24,598
Landlords.

681
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:29,726
You're being unjust to Mohanlal.

682
00:58:31,128 --> 00:58:38,247
There isn't any other kind and
true Brahmin like him in the village.

683
00:58:39,830 --> 00:58:42,833
Hey, I am at fault.

684
00:58:43,730 --> 00:58:47,542
You are unnecessarily
getting angry on him.

685
00:58:48,543 --> 00:58:51,591
I am going right away.

686
00:58:54,478 --> 00:58:55,147
No.

687
00:58:55,227 --> 00:58:56,962
No. Dukhiya, you stay here.

688
00:58:57,506 --> 00:58:59,795
I don't care for their threats.

689
00:59:00,224 --> 00:59:03,304
Till the time me
and my house are there..

690
00:59:03,384 --> 00:59:06,320
No one can throw you out of this.

691
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:10,694
Go! Go!
Go and do whatever you want to.

692
00:59:10,774 --> 00:59:12,116
- What did you say?
- Go!

693
00:59:14,863 --> 00:59:17,328
Do whatever you want to.
I don't care.

694
00:59:17,649 --> 00:59:19,102
Go!

695
00:59:20,446 --> 00:59:23,853
What are you watching?
Throw him out of the house.

696
00:59:26,216 --> 00:59:27,668
Come on.

697
00:59:55,038 --> 00:59:57,517
Come on!

698
01:00:08,741 --> 01:00:10,367
Yes. My dear.

699
01:00:10,858 --> 01:00:11,964
My dear.

700
01:00:12,349 --> 01:00:13,883
The rascals killed him.

701
01:00:13,963 --> 01:00:15,516
No, still there's life.

702
01:00:16,099 --> 01:00:17,784
There's no doctor
or a physician close by.

703
01:00:18,138 --> 01:00:20,614
- I'll go to the city.
- No, you wait here.

704
01:00:20,694 --> 01:00:22,123
No new problem should erupt again.

705
01:00:22,203 --> 01:00:25,679
Somehow I'll call the railway
doctor from the junction.

706
01:01:01,337 --> 01:01:02,477
Hey, let's go.

707
01:01:02,557 --> 01:01:06,201
Mohan called me a monkey when
I asked him for a drop of honey.

708
01:01:06,281 --> 01:01:08,046
I'll teach him a lesson now.

709
01:01:08,126 --> 01:01:10,631
You wait.
I'll see.

710
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:23,471
Give.
Give me the flag.

711
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,161
The post can needs to be stopped.

712
01:01:52,503 --> 01:01:54,966
Stupid. Let your brother go to hell.

713
01:01:55,046 --> 01:01:56,624
With whose orders
did you stop the vehicle?

714
01:01:56,648 --> 01:01:58,285
Wait, I'll report about you.

715
01:01:58,365 --> 01:02:00,245
Chief, you do whatever
you want to, to me.

716
01:02:00,325 --> 01:02:02,492
By please feel pity on
my brother Mohan's condition.

717
01:02:02,572 --> 01:02:04,908
He's dying.
There's no doctor here.

718
01:02:04,988 --> 01:02:07,961
I'll bring the doctor from
the junction. Please take me.

719
01:02:08,041 --> 01:02:10,515
Get aside, you mad.
Start the van.

720
01:02:14,006 --> 01:02:15,466
Oh God!

721
01:02:22,807 --> 01:02:23,891
Father!

722
01:02:30,484 --> 01:02:31,705
Father!

723
01:02:34,095 --> 01:02:37,040
Now the priest will enjoy
for calling me a monkey.

724
01:02:39,246 --> 01:02:42,006
Father!
Father!

725
01:02:46,971 --> 01:02:48,499
Hey, what kind of
an evil person are you?

726
01:02:48,523 --> 01:02:52,450
A Brahmin's house is on fire
and you're just watching the scene.

727
01:02:52,530 --> 01:02:54,250
Come on.
Bring water.

728
01:03:05,389 --> 01:03:06,699
Kasturi.

729
01:03:08,177 --> 01:03:13,434
I couldn't do anything
for brother Mohan.

730
01:03:14,679 --> 01:03:18,207
Now I have faith only in God.

731
01:03:31,702 --> 01:03:32,966
No, no.

732
01:03:34,046 --> 01:03:38,336
Let's go.
Let's go and see brother Mohan.

733
01:03:47,205 --> 01:03:49,054
Hey, police!
Father.

734
01:03:59,595 --> 01:04:01,887
Is it your duty on this crossing?

735
01:04:01,967 --> 01:04:02,975
Yes, sir.

736
01:04:10,638 --> 01:04:12,416
Where's Dukhiya?

737
01:04:13,306 --> 01:04:15,939
He's gone to fetch a doctor
from the junction for you.

738
01:04:16,485 --> 01:04:18,868
Hey, why did you send him?

739
01:04:20,896 --> 01:04:23,712
Poor guy himself is dying.

740
01:04:25,798 --> 01:04:28,021
Is junction close by?

741
01:04:34,092 --> 01:04:38,101
Poor guy must have fallen on the road.

742
01:04:40,391 --> 01:04:42,303
I'll go and see.

743
01:04:42,907 --> 01:04:45,502
Hey priest, you don't get up.
I'll go.

744
01:04:46,783 --> 01:04:47,783
Yes.

745
01:04:56,676 --> 01:04:59,004
I've got a message from
the guard of the postal van..

746
01:04:59,734 --> 01:05:01,878
That there were
riots in this village.

747
01:05:02,786 --> 01:05:05,412
- Do you know anything?
- Yes, sir.

748
01:05:06,424 --> 01:05:08,078
I saw it myself.

749
01:05:08,774 --> 01:05:12,214
That physician Babulal
is the root of this problem.

750
01:05:14,199 --> 01:05:16,604
He destroyed us.
You're the root of this problem.

751
01:05:16,684 --> 01:05:19,032
- You've used us.
- You're used us. - You!

752
01:05:19,112 --> 01:05:20,849
You are the root of the trouble.

753
01:05:20,929 --> 01:05:23,899
I put Mohan's shop on fire
because of your instigation.

754
01:05:23,979 --> 01:05:25,867
- And also put his house on fire.
- Yes, this is it.

755
01:05:25,891 --> 01:05:28,031
- Hey, the police is here.
- Police! - Yes.

756
01:05:28,386 --> 01:05:31,062
I just saw the inspector
go towards Dukhiya's house.

757
01:05:31,802 --> 01:05:33,578
Oh God! All will be doomed.

758
01:05:33,658 --> 01:05:35,170
Why're you dying?

759
01:05:35,953 --> 01:05:38,445
If Mohan's son has called the police..

760
01:05:38,525 --> 01:05:40,384
Then, mind you.
He won't be spared.

761
01:05:41,113 --> 01:05:43,728
All of us will deny everything.

762
01:05:45,785 --> 01:05:48,095
But only if the inspector believes us.

763
01:05:48,175 --> 01:05:51,266
Hey, my name is physician Babulal.

764
01:05:51,790 --> 01:05:54,870
I have a medicine for
the power of police as well.

765
01:05:55,342 --> 01:05:57,506
- Why are you scared?
- Police!

766
01:05:58,223 --> 01:06:00,266
I'll go to the village
for investigations.

767
01:06:01,109 --> 01:06:03,595
If the need arises, I'll call for you.

768
01:06:03,869 --> 01:06:05,838
Salute inspector.
Salute.

769
01:06:06,251 --> 01:06:08,524
If the sir permits me,
I'll narrate everything.

770
01:06:08,875 --> 01:06:11,170
All this is that doing
of that physician Babulal.

771
01:06:11,386 --> 01:06:13,227
He has instigated the villagers..

772
01:06:13,410 --> 01:06:15,705
Got them to beat up Mohan
and put his house on fire.

773
01:06:16,023 --> 01:06:18,419
What?
He even burnt his house?

774
01:06:19,186 --> 01:06:21,971
God!
What injustice is this?

775
01:06:22,617 --> 01:06:27,084
Have uncle Mohan, Pratap, aunt
and Meera. Are everyone saved, or?

776
01:06:27,164 --> 01:06:28,345
Don't be scared.

777
01:06:28,664 --> 01:06:31,069
Everyone is saved.
I congratulate Pratap.

778
01:06:31,149 --> 01:06:33,024
He saved Mohan from the burning fire.

779
01:06:33,659 --> 01:06:35,727
I'll go and investigate.

780
01:06:36,387 --> 01:06:39,122
If Mohanlal is in able..

781
01:06:39,747 --> 01:06:41,589
Quickly reach there along with him.

782
01:06:41,882 --> 01:06:43,325
Very good, sir.

783
01:06:45,825 --> 01:06:49,042
You be here.
You'll be called if the need arises.

784
01:06:53,629 --> 01:06:55,446
Brother, Mohan.

785
01:06:56,193 --> 01:06:59,040
I tried to make you
understand a number of times.

786
01:06:59,652 --> 01:07:02,372
To stay away from us untouchables.

787
01:07:02,967 --> 01:07:04,405
But you didn't listen.

788
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:10,896
Darn! You landed into
this problem because of us.

789
01:07:12,133 --> 01:07:15,264
God!
God!

790
01:07:16,051 --> 01:07:17,748
I'll go, father.

791
01:07:18,455 --> 01:07:21,281
I'll go and see what
state those poor guys are in.

792
01:07:25,505 --> 01:07:27,986
Hari?
They are coming.

793
01:07:34,407 --> 01:07:36,580
Dukhiya, you've been sacked.

794
01:07:37,178 --> 01:07:39,551
Vacate the cabin right
now and give the keys to him.

795
01:07:50,180 --> 01:07:53,034
Why are you staring at my face?
Go and vacate the cabin.

796
01:07:53,409 --> 01:07:54,427
Yes, sir.

797
01:07:55,479 --> 01:07:56,711
All right, sir.

798
01:07:59,301 --> 01:08:01,877
All right, now we'll go.
Work attentively.

799
01:08:02,164 --> 01:08:03,164
Yes.

800
01:08:10,296 --> 01:08:13,507
I'll go and bring our
belongings from the cabin.

801
01:08:16,474 --> 01:08:18,256
But where will we go, father?

802
01:08:19,403 --> 01:08:24,790
Why do you feel bad?
Let the house burn if it has burnt.

803
01:08:25,663 --> 01:08:28,662
He who has given us head,
will also give us shelter.

804
01:08:29,674 --> 01:08:31,901
You don't worry, brother.

805
01:08:32,421 --> 01:08:34,261
These trees are standing.

806
01:08:34,341 --> 01:08:37,302
We'll spend the day
peacefully under their shade.

807
01:08:38,270 --> 01:08:40,164
What's in it to fear?

808
01:08:41,063 --> 01:08:42,998
Pratap is there.
I am there.

809
01:08:43,282 --> 01:08:45,895
We'll soon build a new house.

810
01:08:46,724 --> 01:08:48,597
Till then you stay in my house.

811
01:08:49,178 --> 01:08:51,784
Pratap, you go ahead with
mother and daughter-in-law.

812
01:08:52,033 --> 01:08:55,434
By then brother Mohan and
I will handle the investigations.

813
01:08:58,142 --> 01:09:00,458
Hey, may your enemies
live under the trees.

814
01:09:00,761 --> 01:09:03,714
You stay in this cabin
till you don't get work.

815
01:09:04,675 --> 01:09:07,349
Brother, you're very kind.

816
01:09:08,151 --> 01:09:10,840
Since how many days
have you been working?

817
01:09:11,331 --> 01:09:14,732
Where are you from?
What's your name and caste?

818
01:09:14,885 --> 01:09:16,889
Hey, my name is Mannu.

819
01:09:17,933 --> 01:09:21,042
My father used to
often talk about you.

820
01:09:21,354 --> 01:09:23,199
I am Dhannu's son.

821
01:09:28,783 --> 01:09:30,829
Dhannu's son?

822
01:09:31,595 --> 01:09:34,170
You were so small when I last saw you.

823
01:09:34,499 --> 01:09:36,780
Now you've become a youth.

824
01:09:37,523 --> 01:09:43,027
Dhannu and I left the village
together to work for the company.

825
01:09:45,308 --> 01:09:50,212
Kasturi, he's not a stranger.
He's from our village.

826
01:09:50,854 --> 01:09:55,493
I was friends with his father Dhannu..

827
01:09:55,872 --> 01:09:58,292
Just the way I am with Mohan.

828
01:09:59,454 --> 01:10:02,653
Yes.
And you both..

829
01:10:03,006 --> 01:10:05,895
Had also got engaged
in the childhood.

830
01:10:07,464 --> 01:10:09,758
So sir, I won't let
you go anywhere now.

831
01:10:10,326 --> 01:10:13,395
No, brother.
We should not break the law.

832
01:10:14,169 --> 01:10:17,577
Sir has told me to vacate the cabin.

833
01:10:18,157 --> 01:10:20,570
- So.
- You have vacated it.

834
01:10:20,900 --> 01:10:24,155
What problem does anyone have
if I bring my family in this cabin?

835
01:10:25,303 --> 01:10:26,419
Come on.

836
01:10:42,762 --> 01:10:45,430
Come on, come one.

837
01:10:51,150 --> 01:10:53,327
Tell me the truth without any fear.

838
01:10:54,363 --> 01:10:56,008
Who started this fight?

839
01:10:56,706 --> 01:10:58,296
Who all were a part of this?

840
01:10:59,057 --> 01:11:01,345
Who put Mohanlal's shop on fire?

841
01:11:03,218 --> 01:11:04,310
Who.

842
01:11:09,929 --> 01:11:11,402
Tell me.
Was it anyone from these?

843
01:11:13,159 --> 01:11:14,523
Tell me.

844
01:11:18,713 --> 01:11:21,179
Salute, inspector.
Salute.

845
01:11:21,516 --> 01:11:23,651
Salute, inspector.
Salute.

846
01:11:40,131 --> 01:11:41,968
Hey, who is this for?

847
01:11:42,048 --> 01:11:43,377
For sir.

848
01:11:43,830 --> 01:11:46,079
What did you say?
For sir?

849
01:11:49,492 --> 01:11:52,617
No, sir.
It was a mistake.

850
01:11:52,993 --> 01:11:54,412
He wants to bribe you.

851
01:11:54,492 --> 01:11:56,648
Lord Rama.
Lord Rama.

852
01:11:57,180 --> 01:12:00,673
Sir, taking and giving
bribe is unlawful.

853
01:12:01,984 --> 01:12:04,582
Bhawani.
Bhawani.

854
01:12:05,374 --> 01:12:06,894
Say Bhawani later.

855
01:12:07,540 --> 01:12:08,566
First tell me your name.

856
01:12:08,646 --> 01:12:09,646
Name?

857
01:12:10,100 --> 01:12:12,688
Sir, my name's physician Babulal.

858
01:12:24,538 --> 01:12:26,401
So, you are physician Babulal.

859
01:12:26,611 --> 01:12:28,821
Has sir heard my name?

860
01:12:29,797 --> 01:12:30,874
Why not?

861
01:12:31,549 --> 01:12:34,802
For the last 15 generations,
my forefathers.

862
01:12:34,882 --> 01:12:36,709
Who's asking about your forefathers?

863
01:12:39,113 --> 01:12:40,664
We are bothered about you.

864
01:12:40,744 --> 01:12:42,284
And this fight.

865
01:12:54,580 --> 01:12:56,476
Which fight, sir?

866
01:12:57,126 --> 01:12:58,191
Oh!

867
01:12:59,865 --> 01:13:02,001
As if the poor guy
doesn't know anything.

868
01:13:02,953 --> 01:13:05,332
Sir, the fight..

869
01:13:05,885 --> 01:13:08,810
In which you happily
broke Mohanlal's head..

870
01:13:09,230 --> 01:13:11,237
And put his shop on fire.

871
01:13:11,556 --> 01:13:12,807
No, sir.

872
01:13:13,690 --> 01:13:16,174
To trap us poor..

873
01:13:16,612 --> 01:13:19,553
He broke his head himself.

874
01:13:19,917 --> 01:13:22,068
And also put his shop on fire.

875
01:13:22,842 --> 01:13:25,486
All right.
So, Mohanlal is mad.

876
01:13:25,724 --> 01:13:28,429
Absolutely, sir.
Absolutely mad.

877
01:13:28,931 --> 01:13:32,415
Ask all of them.
They know everything.

878
01:13:33,649 --> 01:13:37,990
If Mohan was not mad, he would
have sold clove oil in his craze.

879
01:13:38,619 --> 01:13:41,252
By fooling us who belonged
to the superior caste..

880
01:13:41,332 --> 01:13:43,714
- Would he make friends with an untouchable?
- Stop it.

881
01:13:46,098 --> 01:13:47,322
Don't talk rubbish.

882
01:13:48,394 --> 01:13:50,537
I know all you miscreants very well.

883
01:13:51,027 --> 01:13:54,781
Sir, you become a deputy
and decide about us.

884
01:13:55,140 --> 01:13:58,280
Yes, you are our deputy, master.

885
01:13:58,950 --> 01:14:03,483
We accept sir,
that we fought with Mohanlal.

886
01:14:04,313 --> 01:14:07,658
But we were fed up of him, sir.

887
01:14:08,582 --> 01:14:10,225
All right, inspector.

888
01:14:10,843 --> 01:14:14,852
These people must have surely
been fed up of my headstrong nature.

889
01:14:15,892 --> 01:14:19,121
All right.
So, are you Mohanlal?

890
01:14:21,582 --> 01:14:24,270
Still I'll have to
file complaint them.

891
01:14:25,696 --> 01:14:27,709
Therefore, you file a proper report.

892
01:14:28,518 --> 01:14:30,539
And investigate them.

893
01:14:36,564 --> 01:14:39,999
Sir, neither do I have
any complaints about anyone..

894
01:14:40,539 --> 01:14:42,978
Nor can I investigate anyone.

895
01:14:44,596 --> 01:14:45,626
But.

896
01:14:46,317 --> 01:14:47,742
The crime is serious.

897
01:14:48,557 --> 01:14:50,135
Therefore, these people..

898
01:14:50,215 --> 01:14:52,315
Will have to a face
a trial from the government.

899
01:14:55,995 --> 01:14:58,352
Arrest them and take
them to the police station.

900
01:14:58,432 --> 01:15:01,068
No.
No, master.

901
01:15:01,148 --> 01:15:03,348
We'll die, master.

902
01:15:19,873 --> 01:15:27,873
"The bird flies in
the air singing this song."

903
01:15:35,277 --> 01:15:43,277
"Come my dear,
we'll play the game of love."

904
01:15:50,165 --> 01:15:58,165
"The bird flies in
the air singing this song."

905
01:16:04,889 --> 01:16:12,889
"Come my dear,
we'll play the game of love."

906
01:16:19,332 --> 01:16:26,777
"Flies along with the bird."

907
01:16:26,857 --> 01:16:33,527
"The colorful river of the heart."

908
01:16:33,862 --> 01:16:41,188
"Flies along with the bird."

909
01:16:41,268 --> 01:16:47,819
"The colorful river of the heart."

910
01:17:10,014 --> 01:17:16,107
"Me sorrowful, I am separated."

911
01:17:16,187 --> 01:17:21,979
"Whom should I play with?"

912
01:17:23,948 --> 01:17:29,912
"Me sorrowful, I am separated."

913
01:17:29,992 --> 01:17:35,787
"Whom should I play with?"

914
01:17:37,599 --> 01:17:45,599
"The bird flies in
the air singing this song."

915
01:17:51,297 --> 01:17:59,297
"Come my dear,
we'll play the game of love."

916
01:18:10,651 --> 01:18:12,953
Tell me, sister.
Hope you're fine.

917
01:18:13,559 --> 01:18:16,395
It's been so many days.
You didn't even think of us.

918
01:18:16,627 --> 01:18:19,823
What can I say, sister?
It was a bad time.

919
01:18:20,503 --> 01:18:22,809
As soon as I stepped
in my marital home..

920
01:18:23,384 --> 01:18:25,602
A mountain of sorrow collapsed.

921
01:18:26,343 --> 01:18:27,738
The house got burnt.

922
01:18:27,893 --> 01:18:30,022
Father-in-law's head broke.

923
01:18:31,633 --> 01:18:33,267
I know, sister.

924
01:18:34,190 --> 01:18:36,832
It's not your fault in this.

925
01:18:38,105 --> 01:18:39,802
We people are at fault.

926
01:18:40,328 --> 01:18:43,475
New daughter-in-law brings happiness
and prosperity to her in-laws.

927
01:18:44,077 --> 01:18:45,697
But since I came..

928
01:18:46,225 --> 01:18:49,221
I don't know why, we are
facing calamities one after the other.

929
01:18:49,884 --> 01:18:51,974
And what's sorrowful is..

930
01:18:52,212 --> 01:18:54,352
That, he too thinks the same.

931
01:18:54,741 --> 01:18:57,359
No, sister.
Why do you say so?

932
01:18:57,686 --> 01:18:59,261
Why does he remain upset?

933
01:19:00,069 --> 01:19:02,137
I regret the fact..

934
01:19:02,358 --> 01:19:04,316
That I couldn't make him happy.

935
01:19:06,636 --> 01:19:08,998
Does he stay away from you?

936
01:19:09,165 --> 01:19:11,657
He doesn't stay away from anyone.

937
01:19:12,255 --> 01:19:14,676
His nature is so good.

938
01:19:15,124 --> 01:19:17,264
What hurts me is..

939
01:19:17,630 --> 01:19:22,148
That, he talks and
mingles with everyone.

940
01:19:22,839 --> 01:19:25,140
But his mind is somewhere else.

941
01:19:26,219 --> 01:19:27,324
Sister.

942
01:19:28,424 --> 01:19:31,675
You haven't read his nature yet.

943
01:19:33,390 --> 01:19:35,946
He definitely loves you.

944
01:19:37,815 --> 01:19:39,192
Don't worry.

945
01:19:40,634 --> 01:19:41,873
What can I do, sister?

946
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:44,403
My mind doesn't agree.

947
01:19:45,376 --> 01:19:46,707
I know..

948
01:19:47,100 --> 01:19:49,564
That he respects me a lot.

949
01:19:49,962 --> 01:19:51,665
He talks and laughs with me.

950
01:19:52,365 --> 01:19:54,607
But, his mind is somewhere else.

951
01:19:55,021 --> 01:19:57,813
No, no.
You're his wife.

952
01:19:58,609 --> 01:20:01,741
Where else can his
mind be if not with you?

953
01:20:02,574 --> 01:20:06,124
What?
Do all husbands love their wives?

954
01:20:06,787 --> 01:20:08,811
You don't know about Kajri.

955
01:20:09,158 --> 01:20:11,176
She stays close to our house.

956
01:20:11,602 --> 01:20:13,394
And belongs to your caste.

957
01:20:13,996 --> 01:20:16,225
It's been years since she got married.

958
01:20:16,408 --> 01:20:19,594
And her husband doesn't
even come near her.

959
01:20:20,317 --> 01:20:23,170
Kajri's parents have sent me to see..

960
01:20:23,469 --> 01:20:25,764
Whether you're actually re marrying.

961
01:20:26,267 --> 01:20:27,595
What do I do if I don't?

962
01:20:28,336 --> 01:20:30,161
They don't send Kajri.

963
01:20:30,963 --> 01:20:33,794
They are ready to give you
their house and their property.

964
01:20:34,153 --> 01:20:36,530
- But you don't agree.
- I may be poor.

965
01:20:37,123 --> 01:20:39,992
But living on in-law's food,
is not acceptable to me.

966
01:20:42,321 --> 01:20:47,246
Brother.
Mannu looks a decent man.

967
01:20:48,318 --> 01:20:50,656
If he didn't have another wife..

968
01:20:50,910 --> 01:20:53,647
I would definitely
get Kasturi married to him.

969
01:20:54,422 --> 01:20:56,683
Hey, what's in it to think?

970
01:20:57,015 --> 01:20:59,000
I too had two mothers.

971
01:20:59,559 --> 01:21:02,008
But they never fought.

972
01:21:04,448 --> 01:21:07,803
If you advise,
then I'll get Kasturi married.

973
01:21:08,306 --> 01:21:10,745
Mannu has done big favor on us.

974
01:21:13,034 --> 01:21:16,016
Is your alliance with
Dukhiya's daughter is fixed?

975
01:21:17,270 --> 01:21:19,951
Father had got the both
of us engaged when we were kids.

976
01:21:20,933 --> 01:21:23,023
Now destiny has brought
us together again.

977
01:21:23,333 --> 01:21:24,682
It's a matter of co-incidence.

978
01:21:25,517 --> 01:21:26,517
Sure.

979
01:21:44,815 --> 01:21:46,911
What problem do they
have if I am getting married?

980
01:21:48,339 --> 01:21:49,984
Go tell them, I don't care.

981
01:21:55,434 --> 01:21:57,452
- Who's he, sir?
- Who?

982
01:21:57,739 --> 01:21:59,734
She, who's laughing looking at you?

983
01:21:59,929 --> 01:22:02,137
She?
She stays in this village.

984
01:22:02,631 --> 01:22:05,064
One is the wife of my acquaintance.

985
01:22:05,144 --> 01:22:08,129
- And the other.
- Yes, I am asking about the other.

986
01:22:08,209 --> 01:22:09,854
She's Dukhiya's daughter, isn't she?

987
01:22:09,934 --> 01:22:11,058
How do you know?

988
01:22:11,182 --> 01:22:13,057
When I was searching for you..

989
01:22:13,137 --> 01:22:15,567
She was standing
outside Dukhiya's hut.

990
01:22:15,647 --> 01:22:18,662
That's why you're re marrying, master.

991
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:19,960
Why?

992
01:22:19,995 --> 01:22:23,940
You're very innocent. Kajri is not
even equal to the dust beneath her feet.

993
01:22:28,448 --> 01:22:29,951
Why, brother?

994
01:22:30,375 --> 01:22:32,959
Kasturi will be happy with Mannu.

995
01:22:41,055 --> 01:22:43,603
There's no doubt about it.

996
01:22:44,075 --> 01:22:47,011
No. What's in it to doubt?

997
01:22:47,559 --> 01:22:51,855
Our Kasturi is a very
innocent and content girl.

998
01:22:52,465 --> 01:22:54,907
No matter how you keep her,
she'll be happy.

999
01:22:55,800 --> 01:22:58,242
She'll quietly suffer
even if she's in sorrow.

1000
01:23:02,564 --> 01:23:03,776
What say, daughter?

1001
01:23:04,842 --> 01:23:08,510
Your father found a
groom for you before me.

1002
01:23:08,944 --> 01:23:09,944
Is it?

1003
01:23:10,108 --> 01:23:12,435
Oh! Very innocent.

1004
01:23:13,010 --> 01:23:16,615
As if she doesn't know anything?
Who the groom is?

1005
01:23:17,031 --> 01:23:18,173
How would I know?

1006
01:23:19,414 --> 01:23:20,750
How would I know?

1007
01:23:21,143 --> 01:23:22,908
Hey, listen.

1008
01:23:23,376 --> 01:23:25,668
Sweetmeats are jumping in your mind.

1009
01:23:26,242 --> 01:23:28,100
And on top of it.

1010
01:23:28,180 --> 01:23:29,228
Stop it, uncle.

1011
01:23:30,790 --> 01:23:33,961
A daughter is born to be given away.

1012
01:23:34,332 --> 01:23:35,872
Yes, but with whom?

1013
01:23:36,848 --> 01:23:38,382
With the one of her caste.

1014
01:23:38,701 --> 01:23:40,055
Who else?

1015
01:23:44,837 --> 01:23:48,192
Did you see the cheat?
She fooled me.

1016
01:23:48,728 --> 01:23:56,728
"Whom would the mad love?
Who's yours?"

1017
01:23:59,019 --> 01:24:07,019
"Whom would the mad love?
Who's yours?"

1018
01:24:09,008 --> 01:24:17,008
"Who's yours? Who's yours?
Who's yours?"

1019
01:24:18,791 --> 01:24:26,791
"Who's yours? Who's yours?
Who's yours?"

1020
01:24:35,447 --> 01:24:43,447
"Whom would the mad love?
Who's yours?"

1021
01:24:46,205 --> 01:24:53,780
"The relationships of the world
are fake."

1022
01:24:54,388 --> 01:25:01,522
"The customs of the world are fake."

1023
01:25:02,323 --> 01:25:10,323
"The worldly meetings are fake.
The customs of the world are fake."

1024
01:25:15,794 --> 01:25:23,794
"You don't have any friend, dear.
Who's yours."

1025
01:25:24,627 --> 01:25:32,627
"Whom would the mad love?
Who's yours?"

1026
01:25:33,965 --> 01:25:40,129
"You don't have any destination."

1027
01:25:46,388 --> 01:25:53,091
"What was mine belongs
to someone else."

1028
01:25:59,102 --> 01:26:07,102
"This life is a burden.
Who's yours?"

1029
01:26:08,474 --> 01:26:16,474
"Whom would the mad love?
Who's yours?"

1030
01:26:17,805 --> 01:26:25,805
"Who's yours? Who's yours?
Who's yours?"

1031
01:26:33,199 --> 01:26:41,199
"Whom would the mad love?
Who's yours?"

1032
01:27:03,624 --> 01:27:04,911
Where had you been?

1033
01:27:05,984 --> 01:27:07,538
To Dukhiya.

1034
01:27:08,498 --> 01:27:10,497
Listen to one spicy news.

1035
01:27:10,692 --> 01:27:11,692
What?

1036
01:27:12,371 --> 01:27:17,000
Kasturi's marriage is fixed.
And luckily we found a nice groom.

1037
01:27:18,070 --> 01:27:21,528
Mannu, who's come in place of Dukhiya.

1038
01:27:23,828 --> 01:27:25,951
But how do we arrange the money?

1039
01:27:26,389 --> 01:27:27,990
I had a wish.

1040
01:27:28,508 --> 01:27:30,918
The way we got Pratap married.

1041
01:27:31,392 --> 01:27:33,710
Similarly,
we should get Kasturi married.

1042
01:27:37,635 --> 01:27:38,635
Yes.

1043
01:27:39,135 --> 01:27:41,395
Mannu, you blame your parents.

1044
01:27:42,271 --> 01:27:44,443
Neither had they stopped
you from going to her house..

1045
01:27:44,853 --> 01:27:46,615
Nor would he remarry.

1046
01:27:47,455 --> 01:27:48,883
Has he got married?

1047
01:27:50,304 --> 01:27:51,489
I don't know properly.

1048
01:27:52,280 --> 01:27:53,280
All right.

1049
01:27:55,705 --> 01:27:57,881
I'll go and find out.

1050
01:28:03,101 --> 01:28:04,955
I just know..

1051
01:28:06,016 --> 01:28:08,020
That I love you.

1052
01:28:10,544 --> 01:28:11,544
Kasturi.

1053
01:28:12,164 --> 01:28:13,579
Listen to me.

1054
01:28:14,693 --> 01:28:16,423
Come, let's elope.

1055
01:28:19,426 --> 01:28:20,993
Won't you come, Kasturi?

1056
01:28:22,766 --> 01:28:23,986
Pratap.

1057
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:54,728
No, Pratap.

1058
01:28:55,929 --> 01:28:57,655
I can't do this.

1059
01:28:58,580 --> 01:29:01,393
Our match is not destined.

1060
01:29:03,414 --> 01:29:05,012
You are a Brahmin.

1061
01:29:08,037 --> 01:29:11,198
I, and untouchable.

1062
01:29:14,538 --> 01:29:15,544
Pratap.

1063
01:29:16,437 --> 01:29:18,742
I can't get away from this marriage.

1064
01:29:23,701 --> 01:29:25,045
God!

1065
01:29:26,167 --> 01:29:29,109
Why didn't you make
me an untouchable as well?

1066
01:29:36,238 --> 01:29:39,472
- Didn't you hear? Kajri won't go.
- Yes.

1067
01:29:41,777 --> 01:29:44,824
Uncle, if Mannu is her husband..

1068
01:29:45,287 --> 01:29:47,328
Let her go if she
wants to go to him.

1069
01:29:47,408 --> 01:29:49,075
What did you say?
Let her go.

1070
01:29:49,155 --> 01:29:51,392
Yes, I'll go.
And definitely go.

1071
01:29:51,569 --> 01:29:54,334
Did you hear? She'll go.

1072
01:29:54,538 --> 01:29:56,805
Keep quiet, Kajri.
Small mouth and big talks.

1073
01:29:56,885 --> 01:30:00,184
Why? I am not a kid to keep quiet.

1074
01:30:00,433 --> 01:30:02,368
So what if he's remarried.

1075
01:30:02,573 --> 01:30:05,497
I too am wedded to him.
How can he leave me?

1076
01:30:05,577 --> 01:30:08,849
Hey, if he cared for you,
he would have come.

1077
01:30:09,258 --> 01:30:11,925
We gave him the house, the property.

1078
01:30:12,005 --> 01:30:13,813
But he kicked everything.

1079
01:30:13,893 --> 01:30:15,629
He called me so many times.

1080
01:30:15,955 --> 01:30:17,519
But did you send me?

1081
01:30:17,599 --> 01:30:19,837
I'll go and definitely go.

1082
01:30:19,917 --> 01:30:21,600
These are modern times.
Modern times.

1083
01:30:21,832 --> 01:30:24,697
A feet long girl and mile long tongue.

1084
01:30:24,919 --> 01:30:28,076
Had I said something like this,
my parents would have skinned me.

1085
01:30:28,156 --> 01:30:29,400
Try touching me.

1086
01:30:29,480 --> 01:30:30,480
Yes!

1087
01:30:31,317 --> 01:30:33,329
Try touching me.

1088
01:30:33,539 --> 01:30:35,402
This is the only cure for women.

1089
01:30:35,482 --> 01:30:37,808
The ghosts who understand beatings,
don't agree with words.

1090
01:30:38,024 --> 01:30:41,491
You may break my bones,
I'll not agree without going.

1091
01:30:41,629 --> 01:30:42,995
Whom will you go to?

1092
01:30:43,133 --> 01:30:45,384
He won't even spit on your face.

1093
01:30:45,715 --> 01:30:48,182
His wife is more beautiful than you.

1094
01:30:48,365 --> 01:30:50,969
When did I say that
she is prettier than Kajri?

1095
01:30:51,357 --> 01:30:52,595
Let her be if she is.

1096
01:30:52,675 --> 01:30:55,211
Let me see,
which fairyland's fairy she is.

1097
01:30:58,114 --> 01:31:01,695
Yes. You're also jealous
of that fairlyland's fairy.

1098
01:31:01,775 --> 01:31:03,573
Yes, jealous.

1099
01:31:03,706 --> 01:31:05,464
Who's she to take away my right?

1100
01:31:05,544 --> 01:31:07,886
Here she's talking about rights.
Try going.

1101
01:31:09,886 --> 01:31:10,886
Look.

1102
01:31:16,386 --> 01:31:17,531
Kasturi.

1103
01:31:18,687 --> 01:31:20,921
Are you happy after
getting married to me?

1104
01:31:22,006 --> 01:31:24,543
My joys lie in your joys.

1105
01:31:25,853 --> 01:31:28,214
My happiness lies in your happiness.

1106
01:31:30,036 --> 01:31:34,419
I always experience a void in my life.

1107
01:31:36,420 --> 01:31:37,936
You've filled it.

1108
01:31:39,102 --> 01:31:41,834
My heart, was lonely.

1109
01:31:43,995 --> 01:31:45,782
You've prospered it.

1110
01:31:47,375 --> 01:31:49,682
As days pass..

1111
01:31:50,573 --> 01:31:53,873
Your love makes a place
for itself in my heart.

1112
01:31:55,730 --> 01:31:57,786
You're very kind.

1113
01:31:58,895 --> 01:32:04,582
You've done a lot of
favors on father and me.

1114
01:32:08,117 --> 01:32:12,841
"Where have you gone, boatman?"

1115
01:32:12,921 --> 01:32:17,796
"Where have you gone, boatman?"

1116
01:32:18,008 --> 01:32:23,370
"Where have you gone, boatman?"

1117
01:32:23,966 --> 01:32:31,966
"The boat sinks.
The boat sinks."

1118
01:32:33,303 --> 01:32:41,303
"Where have you gone, boatman?"

1119
01:32:43,345 --> 01:32:49,686
"Where have you gone, boatman?"

1120
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:59,000
"Had I known that love is painful."

1121
01:33:12,955 --> 01:33:20,955
"In the whole city,
no one would fall in love with anyone."

1122
01:33:35,573 --> 01:33:40,864
"You've left me in trouble."

1123
01:33:40,944 --> 01:33:46,031
"You've left me in trouble."

1124
01:33:46,111 --> 01:33:52,043
"You've left me in trouble."

1125
01:33:52,352 --> 01:33:57,736
"The boat sinks."

1126
01:33:57,816 --> 01:34:02,189
"The boat sinks."

1127
01:34:02,269 --> 01:34:07,504
"Where have you gone, boatman?"

1128
01:34:07,584 --> 01:34:12,842
"Where have you gone, boatman?"

1129
01:34:12,922 --> 01:34:18,535
"Where have you gone, boatman?"

1130
01:34:32,507 --> 01:34:36,984
Kasturi, these tears?
Why?

1131
01:34:37,496 --> 01:34:39,055
What's your grief?

1132
01:34:43,913 --> 01:34:45,126
Nothing.

1133
01:34:53,775 --> 01:34:55,513
Nothing.

1134
01:34:57,518 --> 01:34:58,973
Just like that.

1135
01:35:03,413 --> 01:35:05,443
This mind doesn't agree.

1136
01:35:10,191 --> 01:35:11,905
Save me.

1137
01:35:13,741 --> 01:35:15,589
Protect me, Lord.

1138
01:35:36,379 --> 01:35:41,212
"My companions have
been separated from me."

1139
01:35:41,292 --> 01:35:46,086
"The boatman, life partner."

1140
01:35:46,166 --> 01:35:50,858
"My companions have
been separated from me."

1141
01:35:50,938 --> 01:35:56,013
"The boatman, life partner."

1142
01:35:56,093 --> 01:36:00,991
"The boatman, life partner."

1143
01:36:07,659 --> 01:36:11,769
"Who'll take me to the shore?"

1144
01:36:11,849 --> 01:36:16,660
"Who'll take me to the shore?"

1145
01:36:16,740 --> 01:36:22,073
"Who'll take me to the shore?"

1146
01:36:22,484 --> 01:36:27,748
"The boat sinks."

1147
01:36:27,828 --> 01:36:31,961
"The boat sinks."

1148
01:36:32,041 --> 01:36:36,993
"Where have you gone, boatman?"

1149
01:36:37,073 --> 01:36:41,839
"Where have you gone, boatman?"

1150
01:36:41,919 --> 01:36:48,291
"Where have you gone, boatman?"

1151
01:36:49,923 --> 01:36:53,273
So what?
I too am wedded to him.

1152
01:36:53,793 --> 01:36:56,407
Your daughter might
get married to him.

1153
01:36:56,487 --> 01:36:58,922
She can't snatch my right.

1154
01:36:59,171 --> 01:37:01,481
No matter how many
times a person marries.

1155
01:37:02,639 --> 01:37:05,153
But, which justice is this?

1156
01:37:05,357 --> 01:37:08,576
That he keeps one in the house
and not even see the other's face?

1157
01:37:20,226 --> 01:37:23,606
Do you love someone else?

1158
01:37:24,197 --> 01:37:25,635
Tell me.

1159
01:37:27,421 --> 01:37:28,891
How do I tell you?

1160
01:37:29,562 --> 01:37:33,254
God! Why are you giving
me one grief after the other?

1161
01:37:41,503 --> 01:37:45,887
I've hurt you further by asking.

1162
01:37:46,982 --> 01:37:48,818
Please forgive me.

1163
01:37:50,128 --> 01:37:53,368
No, Meera.
You forgive me.

1164
01:37:54,994 --> 01:37:58,527
I destroyed your life.

1165
01:38:00,487 --> 01:38:02,754
I was yours because of the promise.

1166
01:38:03,887 --> 01:38:07,154
But, I couldn't be yours from my mind.

1167
01:38:09,326 --> 01:38:13,268
My heart knows how much I tried.

1168
01:38:14,301 --> 01:38:17,313
But, all in vain.

1169
01:38:19,145 --> 01:38:22,427
Till now,
no one knew about this secret.

1170
01:38:23,412 --> 01:38:25,614
Today, I'll tell you.

1171
01:38:43,770 --> 01:38:45,141
Come, sister.

1172
01:38:46,701 --> 01:38:49,011
I am your younger sister.

1173
01:38:52,546 --> 01:38:55,743
Snatching an elder sister's
right will be a sin.

1174
01:38:57,781 --> 01:39:01,044
Come.
I'll serve the both of you.

1175
01:39:02,410 --> 01:39:04,444
Come, sister.
Come.

1176
01:39:34,339 --> 01:39:37,147
So you love Kasturi?

1177
01:39:38,599 --> 01:39:41,935
No, no.
I have no right to do that.

1178
01:39:44,210 --> 01:39:46,260
You are my wife, Meera.

1179
01:39:47,096 --> 01:39:48,976
I should love you.

1180
01:39:50,004 --> 01:39:51,749
I'll love you.

1181
01:39:52,945 --> 01:39:53,960
Meera.

1182
01:39:55,875 --> 01:39:57,962
I want to be yours.

1183
01:39:58,977 --> 01:40:02,773
If I can make you happy
even after giving my life..

1184
01:40:03,249 --> 01:40:06,352
Then, I'll consider
that my life was worth it.

1185
01:40:07,133 --> 01:40:10,189
God!
Show me the way.

1186
01:40:16,902 --> 01:40:18,124
Meera.

1187
01:40:24,123 --> 01:40:25,436
I belong to Kasturi.

1188
01:40:26,515 --> 01:40:27,755
And I'll belong to her forever.

1189
01:40:29,380 --> 01:40:32,128
I love her,
and therefore I have married her.

1190
01:40:33,538 --> 01:40:36,706
So what?
You're my master.

1191
01:40:37,254 --> 01:40:39,139
I am your wedded wife.

1192
01:40:39,339 --> 01:40:41,329
How can I live my right?

1193
01:40:42,976 --> 01:40:44,492
Where were you all this while?

1194
01:40:44,572 --> 01:40:47,776
Now you've come to destroy
my happily married life.

1195
01:40:48,884 --> 01:40:50,558
You have married with other girl.

1196
01:40:51,201 --> 01:40:52,864
Till now I had hope..

1197
01:40:53,684 --> 01:40:56,641
That someday you'll
definitely come to me.

1198
01:40:59,193 --> 01:41:01,634
- But.
- I won't come to you ever.

1199
01:41:02,393 --> 01:41:04,668
That's why I've come to you.

1200
01:41:04,748 --> 01:41:06,545
Throw me out if you can.

1201
01:41:06,881 --> 01:41:10,611
No, I can't throw you out.
But I can go.

1202
01:41:11,286 --> 01:41:12,820
Go wherever you want to.

1203
01:41:13,379 --> 01:41:15,435
I too will come along.

1204
01:41:22,521 --> 01:41:23,903
Ruthless.

1205
01:41:25,246 --> 01:41:26,634
Merciless.

1206
01:41:27,113 --> 01:41:28,514
Evil.

1207
01:41:35,053 --> 01:41:38,364
Hey, I would've sent her back.

1208
01:41:38,730 --> 01:41:40,658
But Kasturi didn't agree.

1209
01:41:41,087 --> 01:41:43,609
Kasturi has a different nature.

1210
01:41:43,810 --> 01:41:47,127
Yes.
She has neither worry nor fear.

1211
01:41:47,542 --> 01:41:51,945
On top of it, she handed
over her husband to the other woman.

1212
01:41:52,567 --> 01:41:55,214
After all, what will be the conclusion?

1213
01:41:56,154 --> 01:41:58,151
She's your first wife.

1214
01:41:59,374 --> 01:42:02,271
How can I take away her right?

1215
01:42:03,342 --> 01:42:06,736
But, I love you, Kasturi.

1216
01:42:07,767 --> 01:42:09,329
I love you.

1217
01:42:09,654 --> 01:42:11,623
I am not worthy of this.

1218
01:42:13,683 --> 01:42:17,168
The way your first wife can love you..

1219
01:42:18,749 --> 01:42:20,486
I can't.

1220
01:42:21,023 --> 01:42:24,798
Kasturi, are you testing my love?

1221
01:42:25,382 --> 01:42:29,663
Or, are you saying this on
behalf of Kajri to change my mind?

1222
01:42:32,285 --> 01:42:33,315
Tell me.

1223
01:42:33,944 --> 01:42:35,395
Tell me, Kasturi.

1224
01:42:36,135 --> 01:42:38,146
You love me, do you?

1225
01:42:41,760 --> 01:42:43,537
Who? Kajri?

1226
01:42:43,944 --> 01:42:46,694
Hey! Meera!
What brings you here?

1227
01:42:46,849 --> 01:42:48,607
To my husband.

1228
01:42:48,687 --> 01:42:49,829
Husband?

1229
01:42:57,319 --> 01:42:58,662
Who?

1230
01:43:16,427 --> 01:43:17,532
Mannu.

1231
01:43:20,721 --> 01:43:22,740
Why are you so sad, Kasturi?

1232
01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:26,489
Won't you tell me either?

1233
01:43:26,569 --> 01:43:29,517
Don't ask.
Don't ask.

1234
01:43:30,534 --> 01:43:32,301
I don't know anything.

1235
01:43:34,658 --> 01:43:37,271
I just know..

1236
01:43:38,134 --> 01:43:40,933
That, it's my duty to serve you.

1237
01:43:42,716 --> 01:43:45,481
Destiny made us meet co-incidentally.

1238
01:43:46,802 --> 01:43:50,459
And, no one can escape destiny.

1239
01:43:51,017 --> 01:43:53,913
Kasturi, do you want to escape?

1240
01:43:54,831 --> 01:43:55,831
From me?

1241
01:43:58,455 --> 01:44:00,799
You are my God.

1242
01:44:02,449 --> 01:44:05,796
It's evil even if I think like this.

1243
01:44:21,340 --> 01:44:24,076
Kasturi doesn't love Mannu.

1244
01:44:24,796 --> 01:44:27,289
That's why she was
so hospitable towards me.

1245
01:44:27,655 --> 01:44:32,120
Will any woman hand over her
husband to the other woman like this?

1246
01:44:32,915 --> 01:44:34,594
She can.

1247
01:44:34,806 --> 01:44:36,243
I can.

1248
01:44:36,586 --> 01:44:38,931
Then you may not
be loving your husband?

1249
01:44:40,428 --> 01:44:43,768
God knows, how much I love.

1250
01:44:44,720 --> 01:44:46,710
But he doesn't love me.

1251
01:44:47,276 --> 01:44:49,514
He loves Kasturi.

1252
01:44:49,757 --> 01:44:50,985
No.

1253
01:44:51,400 --> 01:44:55,288
Both have played together
since childhood. Spent time together.

1254
01:44:56,151 --> 01:44:57,808
He can't forget her.

1255
01:44:58,119 --> 01:44:59,424
Kasturi!

1256
01:45:00,132 --> 01:45:03,941
I think, she too loves him.

1257
01:45:04,342 --> 01:45:07,974
Then say it this way.
Kasturi is the cause of all problem.

1258
01:45:08,175 --> 01:45:12,292
She has destroyed our
and our husband's lives.

1259
01:46:26,367 --> 01:46:28,251
Why?
What brings you here?

1260
01:46:28,880 --> 01:46:30,020
Just like that.

1261
01:46:30,100 --> 01:46:31,115
How like that?

1262
01:46:31,541 --> 01:46:35,517
Is anything wrong
in coming to our husband?

1263
01:46:36,513 --> 01:46:40,916
With great difficulty I've got
the chance to talk to you in private.

1264
01:46:41,440 --> 01:46:42,622
What talk?

1265
01:46:43,362 --> 01:46:45,588
It's been so long since I came.

1266
01:46:46,480 --> 01:46:49,563
But, you didn't even look at me.

1267
01:46:50,191 --> 01:46:52,783
What can I do?
Your destiny.

1268
01:46:54,083 --> 01:46:56,398
But your and my destiny is one.

1269
01:46:57,767 --> 01:47:00,622
And, even Kasturi's.

1270
01:47:09,925 --> 01:47:12,158
Tell me, Pratap.
Where are you headed?

1271
01:47:12,510 --> 01:47:15,172
Brother, I've taken a
shop in the Nishanpur fair.

1272
01:47:15,759 --> 01:47:18,359
You know, since the time
we've had the fight with Babulal..

1273
01:47:18,891 --> 01:47:21,700
People have stopped
buying groceries from our shop.

1274
01:47:22,574 --> 01:47:25,239
So, we decided,
let's earn something in the fair.

1275
01:47:25,319 --> 01:47:27,568
Yes, it's good.
You also come along.

1276
01:47:27,819 --> 01:47:29,088
I would've come.

1277
01:47:29,273 --> 01:47:31,500
But I have to report
to the station today.

1278
01:47:32,581 --> 01:47:35,959
Alright, go. With God's grace,
you should have good sales.

1279
01:47:36,206 --> 01:47:37,833
- Good bye.
- Good bye.

1280
01:47:57,557 --> 01:47:59,092
Hey, listen.

1281
01:48:12,136 --> 01:48:20,136
"Why are you talking about pain?"
"No one understands your pain."

1282
01:48:23,950 --> 01:48:31,950
"Why are you talking about pain?"
"No one understands your pain."

1283
01:48:46,102 --> 01:48:51,486
"No one understands what
your heart is going through."

1284
01:48:57,497 --> 01:49:03,237
"No one understands your pain."

1285
01:49:09,594 --> 01:49:17,594
"The wounded understands the condition
of the wounded, and no one else."

1286
01:49:21,117 --> 01:49:29,117
"The wounded understands the condition
of the wounded, and no one else."

1287
01:49:31,572 --> 01:49:39,572
"Why are you talking about pain?"
"No one understands your pain."

1288
01:49:42,458 --> 01:49:50,458
"Why are you talking about pain?"
"No one understands your pain."

1289
01:50:10,124 --> 01:50:11,327
Kajri.

1290
01:50:12,163 --> 01:50:14,464
What?
What are you thinking?

1291
01:50:16,474 --> 01:50:18,177
Same old story.

1292
01:50:21,991 --> 01:50:24,480
Kasturi,
I am going to bring the salary.

1293
01:50:24,777 --> 01:50:26,927
You do the task of showing the flag.
All right.

1294
01:50:27,333 --> 01:50:28,572
But be careful.

1295
01:50:28,652 --> 01:50:31,207
Yes, I know this job very well.

1296
01:50:31,497 --> 01:50:33,812
But who taught you?

1297
01:50:37,724 --> 01:50:40,152
I love him from my heart.

1298
01:50:40,511 --> 01:50:43,013
And he runs from my shadow.

1299
01:50:43,518 --> 01:50:47,582
He can give his life for Kasturi.

1300
01:50:47,662 --> 01:50:50,241
Kajri, this is a matter of destiny.

1301
01:50:50,604 --> 01:50:53,382
I worship my husband like God.

1302
01:50:53,894 --> 01:50:56,230
I don't want my happiness.

1303
01:50:57,004 --> 01:50:59,582
Day and night, I am worried..

1304
01:50:59,948 --> 01:51:02,111
As to somehow he should be happy.

1305
01:51:03,224 --> 01:51:05,270
But, he is not happy.

1306
01:51:08,200 --> 01:51:10,047
His happiness.

1307
01:51:11,001 --> 01:51:13,468
Do you want only his happiness?

1308
01:51:13,751 --> 01:51:16,467
- There's one solution.
- What?

1309
01:51:17,290 --> 01:51:20,098
Look, Pratap is in the fair.

1310
01:51:20,657 --> 01:51:23,854
My husband is going to
the station to bring salary.

1311
01:51:24,242 --> 01:51:27,041
Come, let's somehow
take Kasturi to the fair.

1312
01:51:27,121 --> 01:51:28,210
All right, then?

1313
01:51:28,604 --> 01:51:30,657
Then we'll come here and announce..

1314
01:51:30,919 --> 01:51:33,249
That Kasturi has refused to come.

1315
01:51:33,546 --> 01:51:34,546
And said..

1316
01:51:34,752 --> 01:51:37,491
That she belongs to Pratap.
And I'll stay with him.

1317
01:51:37,733 --> 01:51:40,388
- I don't care about Mannu.
- How'll this help?

1318
01:51:40,780 --> 01:51:43,230
My husband will throw
her out of the house.

1319
01:51:43,750 --> 01:51:45,988
Pratap won't bear to see her in grief.

1320
01:51:46,068 --> 01:51:47,986
And he will call her to him.

1321
01:51:48,313 --> 01:51:50,738
And, malign his name.

1322
01:51:51,708 --> 01:51:53,344
How's this possible?

1323
01:51:53,638 --> 01:51:56,212
Do you want his happiness or malign?

1324
01:51:56,292 --> 01:51:58,940
Happiness,
but not by maligning his name.

1325
01:52:00,572 --> 01:52:02,175
Tell me.

1326
01:52:02,374 --> 01:52:05,454
Is name better or life?

1327
01:52:06,138 --> 01:52:08,887
Meera, the world's
there if there's life.

1328
01:52:09,406 --> 01:52:11,164
Or else, there's nothing.

1329
01:52:11,856 --> 01:52:13,343
You can see for yourself.

1330
01:52:13,742 --> 01:52:16,911
That he's sulking
in Kasturi's memories.

1331
01:52:17,906 --> 01:52:20,173
And if this continues
for some more days..

1332
01:52:20,549 --> 01:52:22,401
- Then, God forbid.
- What?

1333
01:52:22,971 --> 01:52:24,906
The Girdhari in our village..

1334
01:52:25,250 --> 01:52:27,218
Did you forget his son's condition?

1335
01:52:27,859 --> 01:52:30,713
Who gave his life for Champa.

1336
01:52:31,211 --> 01:52:33,663
Entire village went
searching for him..

1337
01:52:33,942 --> 01:52:35,378
But he was not found.

1338
01:52:35,917 --> 01:52:36,945
What was found..

1339
01:52:37,205 --> 01:52:40,764
- Was his corpse hanging from the tree.
- Enough Kajri, enough.

1340
01:52:40,844 --> 01:52:43,592
I am ready to do as you say.

1341
01:52:43,918 --> 01:52:45,621
Somehow his life should be saved.

1342
01:52:46,581 --> 01:52:49,100
Go then.
Quickly go and get ready.

1343
01:52:53,908 --> 01:52:54,965
And, listen.

1344
01:52:55,822 --> 01:52:57,066
Don't be so scared.

1345
01:52:57,265 --> 01:52:59,167
If you get scared,
people will doubt you.

1346
01:52:59,698 --> 01:53:03,325
Go. Wear nice clothes
happily and come to my house.

1347
01:53:04,386 --> 01:53:09,025
And, look. Kasturi and me,
tell both of us to come to the fair.

1348
01:53:09,391 --> 01:53:11,238
- Go. Run.
- All right.

1349
01:53:16,430 --> 01:53:18,573
If Pratap sells
something in the fair..

1350
01:53:18,974 --> 01:53:20,564
Then you'll be fine.

1351
01:53:21,075 --> 01:53:22,845
Then it will be difficult.

1352
01:53:27,197 --> 01:53:28,657
If we don't get good food..

1353
01:53:28,922 --> 01:53:30,780
Then, what will
the other's girl say?

1354
01:53:31,106 --> 01:53:32,953
Who other's girl?

1355
01:53:33,849 --> 01:53:35,320
There she' s coming.

1356
01:53:38,951 --> 01:53:41,926
Mother, shall I go to the fair?

1357
01:53:42,878 --> 01:53:45,217
Kajri and Kasturi are also going.

1358
01:53:47,311 --> 01:53:48,859
Let them go.

1359
01:53:49,208 --> 01:53:50,994
She'll also help Pratap.

1360
01:53:52,299 --> 01:53:55,960
With God's grace,
if the sale is good..

1361
01:53:56,716 --> 01:53:59,228
Then it will be difficult
for him to handle work.

1362
01:54:04,466 --> 01:54:08,307
Yes, your mother has sent
me to ask about your well being.

1363
01:54:08,707 --> 01:54:11,181
Tell her, I am fine.

1364
01:54:11,369 --> 01:54:13,089
And I am adamant.

1365
01:54:13,603 --> 01:54:15,212
All right, I'll leave.

1366
01:54:15,522 --> 01:54:18,682
Your parents are
really worried for you.

1367
01:54:22,906 --> 01:54:25,953
Hey, you should have offered
some refreshments to brother.

1368
01:54:26,307 --> 01:54:28,682
He has always had good food.

1369
01:54:28,877 --> 01:54:31,089
He'll drink jaggery juice over here..

1370
01:54:31,169 --> 01:54:33,403
And the whole village will taunt us.

1371
01:54:33,707 --> 01:54:35,933
Come.
Aren't you coming to the fair?

1372
01:54:36,747 --> 01:54:38,460
Fair?
Let's go.

1373
01:54:38,776 --> 01:54:41,177
Kasturi, you also come.

1374
01:54:41,819 --> 01:54:43,347
He is not at home.

1375
01:54:43,427 --> 01:54:45,593
How can I go without asking him?

1376
01:54:46,161 --> 01:54:49,202
- Then Kajri, you come.
- Wow!

1377
01:54:49,403 --> 01:54:52,578
Younger sister will stay at
home and the elder goes to the fair.

1378
01:54:52,658 --> 01:54:55,589
- How can this happen?
- You're so dramatic.

1379
01:54:55,971 --> 01:54:57,420
If you don't come..

1380
01:54:57,698 --> 01:54:59,549
Then, I will not go either.

1381
01:55:00,191 --> 01:55:03,336
- You go, sister.
- I would've gone.

1382
01:55:03,545 --> 01:55:05,473
But who'll wave flags at the trains?

1383
01:55:05,694 --> 01:55:06,937
I will.

1384
01:55:07,277 --> 01:55:09,170
You go if you want to.

1385
01:55:09,801 --> 01:55:11,271
Won't he say anything.

1386
01:55:11,589 --> 01:55:13,794
Hey, fair doesn't happen everyday.

1387
01:55:14,603 --> 01:55:17,838
Go. I'll talk to him.

1388
01:56:29,485 --> 01:56:31,068
So brother, how're you?

1389
01:56:31,396 --> 01:56:34,142
Why are you asking?
You're sale is so good.

1390
01:56:34,752 --> 01:56:38,029
If this continues, everything will be
sold out before the fair is over.

1391
01:56:38,109 --> 01:56:39,262
Is it?

1392
02:00:48,860 --> 02:00:52,001
"I've brought priceless bangles."

1393
02:00:52,081 --> 02:00:54,795
"Take the bangles. Take them."

1394
02:00:54,875 --> 02:00:57,930
"I've brought priceless bangles."

1395
02:00:58,010 --> 02:01:00,612
"Take the bangles. Take them."

1396
02:01:00,692 --> 02:01:04,501
"The bangles are like silk threads."

1397
02:01:04,581 --> 02:01:08,559
"They may not talk sweetly."

1398
02:01:08,639 --> 02:01:11,544
"Come, bargain."

1399
02:01:11,624 --> 02:01:14,394
"Take the bangles. Take them."

1400
02:01:14,474 --> 02:01:17,410
"Come, bargain."

1401
02:01:17,490 --> 02:01:19,972
"Take the bangles. Take them."

1402
02:01:20,052 --> 02:01:23,713
- "My stuff is priceless."
- "It has no match."

1403
02:01:23,793 --> 02:01:25,693
"Tell me if you want to buy it."

1404
02:01:25,773 --> 02:01:27,573
"Someone buy bangles."

1405
02:01:27,653 --> 02:01:29,619
"My stuff is priceless."

1406
02:01:29,699 --> 02:01:31,600
"It has no match."

1407
02:01:31,680 --> 02:01:33,629
"Tell me if you want to buy it."

1408
02:01:33,709 --> 02:01:35,565
"Someone buy bangles."

1409
02:01:50,024 --> 02:01:53,956
"The married women wear
them to entertain their husbands."

1410
02:01:54,036 --> 02:01:57,973
"Unmarried sisters get married."

1411
02:02:05,942 --> 02:02:09,083
"Other language of love."

1412
02:02:09,998 --> 02:02:13,098
"My stuff is priceless."

1413
02:02:14,061 --> 02:02:16,793
"Other language of love."

1414
02:02:18,072 --> 02:02:21,107
"My stuff is priceless."

1415
02:02:21,187 --> 02:02:23,774
"Take the bangles. Take them."

1416
02:02:47,680 --> 02:02:52,142
"Black bangles in fair hands."

1417
02:02:52,222 --> 02:02:56,342
"These black bangles
are in fair hands."

1418
02:02:56,422 --> 02:03:00,459
"These black bangles
are in fair hands."

1419
02:03:00,539 --> 02:03:04,738
"This strand of hair is
dancing on someone's cheeks."

1420
02:03:04,818 --> 02:03:08,428
"This strand of hair is
dancing on someone's cheeks."

1421
02:03:08,508 --> 02:03:12,777
"Black bangles in fair hands."

1422
02:03:12,857 --> 02:03:16,770
"Your youth allure mind."

1423
02:04:55,872 --> 02:04:57,764
I say, sit at the back.

1424
02:05:11,281 --> 02:05:13,218
Have you lost something?

1425
02:05:13,608 --> 02:05:15,004
The hand shows.

1426
02:05:25,582 --> 02:05:27,412
Hey, Kasturi!

1427
02:05:28,347 --> 02:05:30,764
Pratap!
You too are here?

1428
02:05:34,259 --> 02:05:36,636
Have you seen Meera and Kajri?

1429
02:05:36,952 --> 02:05:39,180
No. I didn't.

1430
02:05:40,142 --> 02:05:42,918
I didn't even know that
you people have come to the fair.

1431
02:05:43,598 --> 02:05:45,608
Meera didn't tell me.

1432
02:05:45,688 --> 02:05:47,137
Let's go.
Hurry up.

1433
02:05:47,734 --> 02:05:49,505
Hey!
Mannu, you're back?

1434
02:05:49,585 --> 02:05:51,317
Hey, you are working at the gate?

1435
02:05:51,747 --> 02:05:53,451
I had told Kasturi.

1436
02:05:53,842 --> 02:05:56,945
Meera has take her
and Kajri to the fair.

1437
02:05:58,344 --> 02:06:01,647
- All right.
- Then I'll meet brother Mohan.

1438
02:06:01,727 --> 02:06:02,727
Good.

1439
02:06:08,504 --> 02:06:10,470
We've searched the whole fair.

1440
02:06:11,088 --> 02:06:12,471
They are not here.

1441
02:06:12,777 --> 02:06:15,648
It seems they returned for
the village searching for you.

1442
02:06:16,592 --> 02:06:20,234
But Meera knew that
I've set up shop here.

1443
02:06:20,862 --> 02:06:22,582
Why didn't they come to me?

1444
02:06:23,826 --> 02:06:27,829
Hope they didn't walk past
your shop searching for me.

1445
02:06:28,665 --> 02:06:30,619
Even I was passing by.

1446
02:06:30,699 --> 02:06:32,302
Just that you called.

1447
02:06:32,617 --> 02:06:34,166
Yes, this must have happened.

1448
02:06:35,139 --> 02:06:36,770
People at home must be worried.

1449
02:06:37,105 --> 02:06:38,793
Come, let's go back to the village.

1450
02:07:59,804 --> 02:08:03,183
Kasturi.
Do you remember those days..

1451
02:08:03,554 --> 02:08:05,511
When we had no worries?

1452
02:08:06,102 --> 02:08:08,624
And we spent all the time playing.

1453
02:08:13,393 --> 02:08:16,318
I become a sparrow of the
forest and sing in the forest.

1454
02:08:17,924 --> 02:08:19,318
Do you remember, Kasturi?

1455
02:08:19,756 --> 02:08:21,856
Yes, I do.

1456
02:08:27,563 --> 02:08:35,031
"I'll become a sparrow in
the forest and sing in the forest."

1457
02:08:35,389 --> 02:08:43,152
"I'll become a bird in
the forest and dance along."

1458
02:08:43,232 --> 02:08:50,547
"I'll become a sparrow in
the forest and sing in the forest."

1459
02:08:50,969 --> 02:08:58,061
"I'll become a bird in
the forest and dance along."

1460
02:09:10,569 --> 02:09:14,030
"I'll fly from branch to branch."

1461
02:09:14,504 --> 02:09:18,305
"I won't get caught."

1462
02:09:18,385 --> 02:09:22,038
"I'll fly from branch to branch."

1463
02:09:22,118 --> 02:09:25,671
"I won't get caught."

1464
02:09:26,114 --> 02:09:28,522
"You fly from branch to branch."

1465
02:09:28,602 --> 02:09:33,170
"I'll fly on every leaf and
won't let you slip away." ♪

1466
02:09:33,250 --> 02:09:36,883
"Will dance along."

1467
02:09:37,542 --> 02:09:39,224
"You fly from branch to branch."

Those were the days.

1476
02:10:28,109 --> 02:10:32,297
Pratap, don't remind me of those days.

1477
02:10:38,024 --> 02:10:39,950
That's not true.
Not true.

1478
02:10:40,397 --> 02:10:42,321
Kasturi will never do this.

1479
02:10:42,984 --> 02:10:44,354
You're lying.

1480
02:10:44,736 --> 02:10:45,736
Is it?

1481
02:10:45,942 --> 02:10:47,341
Ask Meera.

1482
02:10:47,662 --> 02:10:49,348
She won't lie.

1483
02:10:49,669 --> 02:10:52,075
Yes. Kajri is right.

1484
02:10:52,666 --> 02:10:54,496
Kasturi didn't come.

1485
02:10:56,718 --> 02:10:59,555
You've lost your senses
in your love for her.

1486
02:11:00,639 --> 02:11:04,135
If she was true and she loved you..

1487
02:11:04,710 --> 02:11:07,046
Then, would she
let me come near you?

1488
02:11:07,312 --> 02:11:09,108
She is cheating you.

1489
02:11:09,452 --> 02:11:11,806
The witch has maligned our name.

1490
02:11:12,460 --> 02:11:14,620
All right, I'll go to the fair.

1491
02:11:15,106 --> 02:11:17,739
And, I'll clean this
stain with her blood.

1492
02:11:23,573 --> 02:11:26,310
Darn! What have we done?

1493
02:11:26,747 --> 02:11:28,623
If Mannu kills her?

1494
02:11:28,703 --> 02:11:30,288
Or if Pratap?

1495
02:11:30,368 --> 02:11:32,717
Oh God! What will happen now?

1496
02:11:35,858 --> 02:11:37,759
Kajri, what do we do now?

1497
02:11:37,839 --> 02:11:41,295
Meera, run. Go and call
uncle Mohan and father-in-law.

1498
02:11:41,821 --> 02:11:42,821
Darn!

1499
02:11:52,012 --> 02:11:53,012
Yes.

1500
02:11:53,471 --> 02:11:55,880
It's better if we forget those days.

1501
02:11:56,358 --> 02:11:58,009
All right, brother.

1502
02:11:59,563 --> 02:12:02,348
No one gives joys
or sorrows to anyone.

1503
02:12:03,968 --> 02:12:07,547
A person reaps what he sows.

1504
02:12:09,288 --> 02:12:14,887
Deeds of a person don't
leave him for births.

1505
02:12:15,349 --> 02:12:17,312
Let's go.
Hurry up.

1506
02:12:17,712 --> 02:12:20,249
Mannu wants to kill.

1507
02:12:20,816 --> 02:12:24,409
Kasturi and his life is in danger.

1508
02:12:24,983 --> 02:12:27,996
Come on.
Run, save them.

1509
02:12:28,335 --> 02:12:29,335
What?

1510
02:12:34,106 --> 02:12:35,655
What are you doing?

1511
02:12:35,735 --> 02:12:37,729
God save them.

1512
02:12:38,591 --> 02:12:40,665
Leave.
Leave.

1513
02:12:41,405 --> 02:12:42,450
Leave.

1514
02:12:57,068 --> 02:12:58,406
Leave me.

1515
02:13:09,373 --> 02:13:10,684
The post is here.

1516
02:13:12,177 --> 02:13:13,625
The post is here.
Didn't you hear?

1517
02:13:13,796 --> 02:13:15,167
Move the bullock cart.

1518
02:13:15,825 --> 02:13:16,825
The post is here.

1519
02:13:17,633 --> 02:13:19,857
- Don't you hear?
- Don't you hear?

1520
02:13:25,270 --> 02:13:27,547
I don't know how many lives will go.

1521
02:13:28,466 --> 02:13:30,197
I'll stop the van.

1522
02:13:31,237 --> 02:13:33,797
Leave, what are you doing?

1523
02:13:36,103 --> 02:13:37,237
What do I do now?

1524
02:13:37,993 --> 02:13:39,643
I'll stop the van.

1525
02:13:55,788 --> 02:13:58,172
Listen, Kasturi.

1526
02:14:02,607 --> 02:14:03,893
Kasturi!

1527
02:14:24,211 --> 02:14:28,601
She sacrificed her
life to save others lives.

1528
02:14:41,268 --> 02:14:45,033
From her life and death, she showed..

1529
02:14:45,335 --> 02:14:48,122
That great souls
can reside in everyone.

1530
02:14:50,068 --> 02:14:54,438
And, their sacrificed
gave me more strength.

1531
02:14:55,130 --> 02:14:59,219
Now I can die in peace.

1532
02:15:00,232 --> 02:15:02,097
So, did you know?

1533
02:15:02,177 --> 02:15:05,168
- That?
- You want to kill me.

1534
02:15:06,449 --> 02:15:09,357
- Yes.
- Still you came?

1535
02:15:10,146 --> 02:15:11,325
Darn!

1536
02:15:11,573 --> 02:15:13,973
How could I doubt such a true woman?

1537
02:15:14,859 --> 02:15:16,216
It seems..

1538
02:15:16,524 --> 02:15:20,144
This great soul is
still saving people's lives.

1539
02:15:21,811 --> 02:15:25,648
Yes. She saved our lives as well.

1540
02:15:29,119 --> 02:15:37,119
"Krishna lives in
the entire universe."

1541
02:15:38,939 --> 02:15:46,939
"Krishna lives in
the entire universe."
