The baby wasn't moving since yesterday.

16

We got here because we were scared.

There is nothing to fear. 
It's quite common.

Okay, doctor.

Do you think the doctor examined properly?

00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:09,870
Why do you find it so hard to believe?

23
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,830
Then, why can't I sense the 
baby's movements in my womb?

24
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:14,950
Calm yourselves down.

25

us if there is a problem?

Actually, I have to apologise to you.

48
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,300
That day, when you told me 
that the baby wasn't moving...

49
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,870
I've checked the heartbeat and thought 
that everything was alright with the baby.

50
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:46,580
But we understood the situation only 
when we performed the caesarean,

51
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,560
that the umbilical cord was 
tied around the baby's neck

52
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,660
and every time she 
moved, it got tightened.

If you had gone home that day, 
you would have lost your baby for sure.

No. This is Attili Satti's house.

Yes.

You seem very 
enthusiastic to become a Heroine.

135
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:11,200
But the thing is... I don't take 
artists' auditions in a regular manner.

136
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:12,390
Me too.

137
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:15,350
I won't give routine performances. 
It would completely different.

I'll give you a situation...

139
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:20,450
I want you to call some stranger and 
convince them with your performance.

140
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,100
Then, I will give you the 
role of a lead actress.

141
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,410
That's a brilliant idea. 
What's the scene?

-Okay. I'm ready, sir.

-What car is it? 
-It's a Skoda.

150
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,160
Don't worry about that. 
It doesn't have a password.

151
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,830
They have taken you to a 
bungalow and tied you up.

152
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:47,640
Where is that bungalow located?

153
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,780
The kidnappers won't tell you 
their locations or even the Pincode.

154
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,750
Are you here to give audition 
or on a police enquiry?

155
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:54,370
-I was bothered about logics... 
-That's my problem.

156
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:57,240
Just call the person 
and report the situation.

157
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,950
Convince them, make them believe 
and break down in tears.

158
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:02,280
And if possible, 
make them come all the way here.

159
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:03,450
For the role of the heroine, right?

160
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:05,820
Yes. Get started.

to do... Please rescue me.

I don't know, mom. 
This looks to be an abandoned bungalow.

167
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:26,240
They have tied my limbs up.

168

They have even 
taken away my phone.

169
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,950
Mom, they have even 
covered my mouth with tape.

171
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,280
I have a lot of work to do now.

172
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:37,200
Call me in the evening if you want 
to practice your acting skills. Bye.

173
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,560
Mom... Mom...

174
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:40,170
Please believe me... Please.

175
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:42,370
With your hands tied and 
your phone snatched away,

176
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:43,650
how are you able to call me?

177
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:44,210
Oh man!

178
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:46,410
They taped your mouth shut and 
and your nose is bleeding...

179
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:48,480
Stop these 
shenanigans. Disconnect the call.

180
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,700
She didn't believe you, right?

181
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:54,570
Uhuh... One more call?

182
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:58,200
Varsha, tell me. What's up?

183
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,490
Someone kidnapped me... 
at least there is no water

184
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,860
She surpasses the great actress Savithri.

185
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:02,110
They covered my mouth 
with tape. I'm scared.

186
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,370
-Please help me.  
-Enough. Hang up!

187
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,280
Same reaction?

188
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:08,290
Even if you have called the 
police and acted this way,

189
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:09,990
they wouldn't believe 
either. Please leave.

190
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:14,620
[laughs] How would I know that 
you were auditioning for a role?

191
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,240
Never mind, mother. It was all because 
of you that I've lost the audition.

192
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:22,200
Alright, dear. Don't behave this 
way in front of Rahul's parents.

193
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,620
Moreover, it's your first 
time meeting with them.

194
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,490
Rahul is the one who made the 
first move and asked for your hand.

195
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:28,870
He has been waiting for 
you for three years.

196
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:31,570
Varsha... Are you listening to me?

197
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,530
Hmm... [car alarm blips]

198
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:34,950
Oh no!

199
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:39,070
Mom... No western clothes... 
No ripped jeans... No patchwork shirts...

200
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,160
Wear a saree... Wear jewellery... 
Wear a bindi... Isn't that all?

201
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,070
Yes. That's all.

202
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,430
Where do you think I'm going, 
for a dinner or to a temple?

203
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:45,990
Bye.

204
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:51,350
[indistinct chatter]

205
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:52,420
A very good thought, sir.

206
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,280
-Thank you, sir. 
-Best of luck.

207
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:53,880
Mahi...

208
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,360
It's been a long time since I've seen you.

209
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:03,980
My darling...

210
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:12,570
How are you doing?

211
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:13,570
I am good.

212
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,520
Aunty, let's see the exhibition.

213
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:18,900
Let's go.

214
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:20,420
Okay.

215
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:22,850
Mom, Varsha is here.

216
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:25,440
I am telling you once again. Please 
don't discuss her profession. Please.

217
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,270
You might have reminded me that 
for at least fifty times by now.

218
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,420
-Hi. 
-Hi.

219
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:31,190
Come on. Over there.

220
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,060
-Hello, aunty. 
-Hello... Come, sit.

221
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,640
-Hi, uncle. 
-Hello, dear.

222
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:37,460
Sit down.

223
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,520
You look very beautiful in a saree.

224
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:40,310
Thanks, aunty.

225
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:44,970
I love watching movies but I don't have 
a very good opinion on the movie artists.

226
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,100
Ah! I am known to call 
a spade for what it is.

227
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,380
Mom, what did I tell you?

228
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,430
I mean... what did I tell?

229
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,580
Say something...

230
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,560
But I don't mince my words.

231
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:57,920
Women should get married 
and look after the house.

232
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:01,270
Is it necessary for women from our 
families to get into the movie business?

233
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,470
Mom, we are here to have dinner.

234
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,890
Your mother is already in 
the middle of having her full.

235
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:12,470
I felt very happy after I 
heard about your decision.

236
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,620
What are you talking about, aunty?

237
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,590
I heard you have decided to quit acting.

238
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:19,760
Mom, do you want me to order?

239
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:21,010
Varsha... What about you?

240
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,010
Father, would you like me 
to order something for you?

241
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:26,130
Aunty, even I'm like you.

242
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,010
I don't mince my words either.

243
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:30,260
It's my life's ambition 
to become a heroine.

244
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,170
Making things like getting 
married and taking care of the house

245
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,290
were probably 
priorities in your generation.

246
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,720
But for us, it's all about our dreams 
and making those come true.

247
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:41,860
Women are in no way 
inferior to men, aunty.

248
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,310
They are far superior to 
them in all the aspects.

249
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:45,340
What do you say, uncle?

250
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,880
That's true... That's true.

251
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,260
Have you asked for the bill?

252
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:52,760
-We haven't ordered yet. 
-Is it?

253
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:56,480
[phone rings]

254
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:02,710
Isn't it cold in here?

255
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,200
[scoffs]

256
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,670
Geeta, Rahul's mother 
words were very weird.

257
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,340
This doesn't look like a family meeting.

258
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:12,340
This looks like a plan hatched 
to make me quit acting.

259
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:16,840
We heard you were auditioning for 
heroine roles and felt very upset!

260
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,420
I don't mince my words.

261
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:20,920
Women should get married 
and look after the house.

262
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:23,280
Is it necessary or women from our 
families to get into the movie industry?

263
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,290
I call a spade a spade. Ah!

264
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:28,560
Hello? 
Varsha... Varsha...

265
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:30,290
Hello.

266
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:41,510
So, you want me to 
apologise to your mother?

267
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,420
Never mind.

268
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:46,630
Why would you tell them 
that I will quit acting?

269
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:50,740
Why did you lie to them 
that I would quit acting?

270
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,590
They came to meet you only 
when I told them like that.

271
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:54,930
It's been three years.

272
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:57,590
They kept nagging me with questions 
about quitting your profession.

273
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:58,090
So...

274
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:00,630
you decided that I would quit acting.

275
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:02,590
I didn't decide for you. 
I just tried to manage the situation.

276
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:06,090
If only you had been silent for two 
minutes, it would have all been fine.

277
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,920
It wouldn't have been fine, Rahul. It's 
my life's ambition to become a heroine.

278
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,550
It isn't just a silly little wish.

279
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:15,510
What they think of me and my life 
is not of any concern for me.

280
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,800
What do you think?

281
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:19,670
How much longer, Varsha? 
You have been at it for three years now.

282
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,370
Have you made any headway at all?

283
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:23,870
Have you ever supported me?

284
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:26,340
Whenever I did get an 
opportunity in a movie,

285
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:29,960
you'd come up with some complaint 
citing problems with the role or company

286
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,260
and held me back in every aspect.

287
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,340
What is it that you are saying? 
That I am responsible for your failure?

288
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:36,220
So, you have decided that I am a failure.

289
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:37,900
So I should succumb to 
your decisions.

290
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:39,470
-Is that so? 
-I didn't mean that, Varsha.

291
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,920
Stop the car. Stop the car!

292
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,960
[tyres screech] 
[vehicles honking]

293
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,020
Varsha...

294
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:48,090
-Varsha... Please stop. Listen to me. 
-Move the car...

295
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:49,280
-Varsha... 
-What is it in the middle of the road?

296
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,080
-Move your car... 
-Just wait, you guys!

297
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,290
Ow!

298
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,750
[groans]

299
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:26,430
-Excuse me. 
-Yes.

300
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:29,330
-Who is the organiser of this exhibition? 
-You will find them there.

301
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:31,170
Oh! Okay. Thank you. [camera clicks]

302
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:36,740
Hello... Everyone

303
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:41,920
We are very thankful for accepting our 
invitation and coming here. [phone rings]

304
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:52,220
Ever since the advent of the mobiles, 
there is a camera in everybody's hand.

305
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:57,450
But if we go back to 20 years, 
we had only one photo studio per village.

306
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:58,650
[phone rings]

307
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:00,530
Rahul, I am very busy.

308
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:02,410
-I'll call you later. Bye... 
-Varsha... Varsha...

309
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:03,620
Tsk!

310
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:09,300
All the photos that you see right now 
have been clicked in such a photo studio.

311
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:12,160
There is a story behind every photo.

312
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:13,820
There is life in these pictures.

313
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:16,800
And the one to give life to 
these pictures is my father...

314
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:18,250
Mr Anantha Murthy.

315
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:22,220
[phone rings] He didn't just run the 
studio for the money

316
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:23,300
What's your problem?

317
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,190
Varsha, I've parked the 
vehicle in the wrong place.

318
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,290
There is a heavy traffic.

319
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:27,530
This will become a big problem.

320
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:29,310
-Alright. I'll be there.-He never felt photography as profession.

321
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:30,530
He considered it to be his life.

322
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,270
He used to say one thing all the time.

323
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:34,840
Only the camera has the 
power to capture the time.

324
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,370
Dad had a small photo studio in Ooty. 
[camera clicks]

325
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:46,820
In a day, he shot photos 
for at least ten clients...

326
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:48,310
And he did that for forty years.

327
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:50,300
Of the many photos that he took,

328
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:52,940
there were the ones that 
were in displayable condition.

329
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:59,160
Unfortunately, he passed away a year ago.

330
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:03,140
I felt that the only way 
I could show my gratitude

331
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,840
and respect for my 
father's work and talent...

332
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:10,530
and the gratitude of all those in these 
photographs is to organize this exhibition

333
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,570
Thanks a lot for being a 
part of this happy occasion.

334
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:13,770
[applause]

335
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,120
I am sorry, Varsha.

336
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:23,870
I shouldn't have spoken to you like that.

337
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,570
Varsha... It's quite common 
in every relationship to have

338
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:28,630
these kind of minor misunderstandings.

339
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:30,490
This might be a small 
issue for you, Rahul.

340
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,400
But for me, it is a huge issue.

341
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,410
You are asking me to give 
up on my life's ambition.

342
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:37,190
Don't quit. Okay?

343
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,070
No, Rahul.

344
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,320
If you and your mom 
share the same opinion,

345
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:43,460
I think we should give this 
relationship a second thought.

346
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,530
Come on, Varsha.

347
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:46,430
Think. It's just a bad day.

348
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:48,850
It's really a bad day.

349
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:50,390
Then, let's make it a good day.

350
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:53,950
What is this?

351
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:54,770
Car...

352
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:55,770
Gift.

353
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:59,590
If everything went smoothly, 
the car would have been delivered today.

354
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:01,700
Bad luck... 
It got postponed for tomorrow.

355
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:04,070
Go and pick it up from 
the showroom tomorrow.

356
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:08,170
Varsha, I am leaving to the US tonight,

357
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:09,870
on a business work.

358
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:11,550
I will be back in three to four months.

359
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:12,740
I don't want any gift, Rahul.

360
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:17,160
There would be happiness in getting 
things that are earned from hard work,

361
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,970
be it a car or a career.

362
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,530
Please don't mind.

363
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:22,740
And, it's me.

364
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,870
Geeta! I told you I didn't want these 
darned heels. They are broken again.

365
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:39,320
Alright, fine. 
I'll never order online again.

366
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:41,240
Well... Why did you disconnect 
the call suddenly, a while ago?

367
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:41,940
What would it be!

368
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,500
When I was on the call with you,

369
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:45,990
I saw Rahul's mother in the mirror.

370
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:48,210
She looked as determined as 
Dhoni does in a cricket match.

371
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:49,320
Was it a catch?

372
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:50,450
Stumped!

373
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:51,660
[laughs]

374
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:55,210
Look at this.

375
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,310
Hey, was this taken when you were a baby?

376
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,810
I have a feeling that it is my 
photo. But, it's yet to be confirmed.

377
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,390
Please, click it in this pose.

378
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:10,020
It looks worst. 
Please try to understand.

379
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:12,200
-Ok, let's try this pose...  
-I'll just go and ask him. You stay here.

380
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,230
-Okay.-Smile a bit!

381
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,010
Ee...

382
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,740
-Excuse me. [camera clicks] 
-Yes.

383
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,810
-The girl in that picture... 
-She is my girlfriend.

384
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:20,340
Girlfriend? 
-Shouldn't I have one?

385
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,390
-What's her name? 
-I don't know.

386
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:22,990
-Where is she from? 
-I don't remember.

387
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,530
-Do you at least know what she does? 
-Tsk!

388
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:27,940
Huh! It's 10 am, right? 
She might be having breakfast.

389
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:30,250
Why would you ask me 
that? Try to understand.

390
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,340
Every photograph here has a story.

391
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,100
Each of it has a life too.

392
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,250
And so, they have a bit 
of love too, in them.

393
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,290
This is my love story.

394
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:39,140
-Hello. 
-What?

395
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,770
That is the girl in your love story.

396
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:45,710
-[gasps] She looks superb! 
-Hey!

397
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:47,330
-You are superb too! 
-You...

398
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:49,990
Mahi, one more family member is here.

399
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:56,150
[laughs]

400
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:18,630
Hi... Do you know whose photo this is?

401
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:19,630
Why do you ask?

402
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:23,580
I have a feeling that the 
girl in this photo is me.

403
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:26,740
I wanted to know how this 
picture came into your possession.

404
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,030
Don't you remember your own photo?

405
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,550
I know it sounds funny 
when I say it but it's true.

406
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,190
I don't have even a single 
childhood photo of mine.

407
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:35,810
That's why I am 
unable to be so sure of it.

408
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:37,420
You used to live in Ooty, weren't you?

409
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:40,100
My grandfather used to live 
in Ooty. I am from Coonoor.

410
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:42,430
-This photograph was clicked in Ooty. 
-In Ooty?

411
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:44,430
Yes. It was your grandfather 
who got your photograph taken.

412
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,940
I was there as well.

413
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:49,670
-What? Really? 
-Yeah. We are friends.

414
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,780
-Friends? 
-Yes, Varsha.

415
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:56,540
Varsha? I am really shocked.

416
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:00,570
-Stand here in front of the photo... 
-Why?

417
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,880
-It's for the cover of the magazine. 
-Yeah!

418
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:07,080
[camera clicks] I have no memory 
of this photo ever being taken.

419
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:09,270
After you got your photo 
clicked, nobody came to collect it.

420
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:10,840
Maybe that's why you don't remember it.

421
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:16,160
[camera clicks]

422
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:18,360
[phone vibrates] 
One second.

423
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:20,520
Is it? Where is the audition?

424
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:23,960
[camera clicks] 
At Puri sir's office? I am coming.

425
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:31,260
Sorry. I have some work. I really 
have to go. I will meet you later.

426
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,000
It's okay.

427
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,470
If you come to the studio tomorrow, I will 
give you the originals of your photo.

428
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:35,850
-We will talk then. 
-Yeah.

429
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:36,740
Give her our card.

430
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:37,730
Thank you

431
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:39,850
-Bye. I will see you. 
-Bye.

432
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:40,640
Let's go.

433
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:59,170
He is really a good photographer. 
He has won so many awards too.

434
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:02,850
Since when did you want to a photographer?

435
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:06,440
My father is a photographer. 
I observed him very closely.

436
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:09,070
But when I was eight,

437
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,800
I had a bicycle accident 
due to a girl and from then,

438
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,280
I've developed an interest in photography.

439
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,610
Play it again. Play it again.

440
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:16,880
But when I was eight,

441
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:18,610
I had a bicycle accident 
due to a girl and from then,

442
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,290
I've developed an interest in photography.

443
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:54,940
2001, OOTY

444
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,020
Hey!

445
00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:00,300
-Grandpa... 
-Varsha, my angel!

446
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,060
-How have you been, father? 
-I am good, dear.

447
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,460
-Her holidays started from yesterday. 
-We're getting delayed to office.

448
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,070
Hurry.

449
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,230
-We will come on Sunday. 
-Alright.

450
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:07,790
Bye, dear.

451
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:10,020
-Bye, mom. 
-Bye, dad.

452
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,220
Hahaha...

453
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:25,430
[laughs]

454
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:27,920
Very good!

455
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,240
Grandpa, did you get all of these?

456
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,670
Of course! What did you 
think your grandfather was?

457
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,640
Your Grandpa was the 
crown prince of the theatre.

458
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:37,150
When I grow up,

459
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:40,190
I will also become a bigger actor 
than you ever were, Grandpa.

460
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:44,400
Why not? Of course! You will become 
like the legendary actress Savitri.

461
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:48,500
-Grandpa... 
-Yes.

462
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:49,540
Where are the fishes?

463
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,850
Oh no, dear. 
They are dead.

464
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:53,760
The pet shop uncle said 
he would give us new ones.

465
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,800
-I will go and get it. 
-Okay.

466
00:24:56,170 --> 00:25:01,080
[children chatter]

467
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:02,840
-Out of the way! 
-Hey!

468
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,180
Oh God!

469
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:09,400
[crying]

470
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,620
-Thank you. 
-You are welcome.

471
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:33,950
-My name is Varsha. 
-My name is Mahi.

472
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:35,210
-Friends? 
-Friends.

473
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:41,680
-Bye. 
-Bye.

474
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:43,680
Mahi... 
-Yes?

475
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,180
I'll see you tomorrow, right?

476
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:46,230
Done.

477
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:51,360
"Once upon a time..."

478
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:55,870
"the story began like this"

479
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:02,320
"One was a raindrop and the 
other was the foliage..."

480
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:07,590
"and they've become pair like this "

481
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:13,910
"The friendship started"

482
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:19,140
"they've called themselves 
to be half of each other"

483
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:24,620
"And by and by,"

484
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:29,730
"their worlds merged"

485
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:44,740
"Once upon a time..."

486
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:50,190
"the story began thus"

487
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:55,650
"One was a raindrop and the 
other was the foliage..."

488
00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:01,010
"and they've become pair like this "

489
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:05,910
Varsha, this box is looks wonderful.

490
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:09,580
My grandpa gifted me this for my birthday.

491
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:14,290
I'd hide my favourite things in 
this box. This is my treasure box

492
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:15,160
Can I see?

493
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,160
It is just like you.

494
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:21,960
[toy squeaks] 
[laughs]

495
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:24,920
Bangles?

496
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,100
These are my bangles.

497
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:30,380
-What about this? 
-This is my favourite whistle.

498
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,200
[whistles]

499
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:37,390
[indistinct TV playing]

500
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:44,330
Oh no! Grandpa... Is that girl dead?

501
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:47,980
It's just acting. 
Nothing is going to happen to the girl.

502
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,200
Watch... Watch...

503
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,160
TV: Hey, mister! Can't you see?

504
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:55,740
-Phew! So, she is fine?-That is called acting.

505
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:59,300
To be called an actor, you should be 
able to evoke all the nine emotions.

506
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:02,120
You have to breathe life 
into the roles you undertake.

507
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,470
Then, I will do it too.

508
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,200
Hey! Enough with the nonsense. Just eat.

509
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:08,200
He is enough... to pamper her.

[bicycle bell tinkles]

511
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:31,980
-Hey... 
-Oh...

512
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,180
-Ow! 
-Ouch!

513
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:40,400
Are you badly hurt?

514
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:42,510
-Nothing at all... 
-Tsk! Shh!

515
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:48,160
-Do you know how to take a picture? 
-I do.

516
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:50,080
-Will you take mine? 
-Hey!

517
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:52,990
When?

518
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,980
-Umm... After the wounds heal... 
-Okay.

519
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:57,660
You have to be silent.

520
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:00,220
-She isn't bruised much. 
-Okay, sir.

521
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,200
You can take her home.

522
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,660
-Grandpa. 
-Take care, dear.

523
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:06,410
Come Varsha. Come.

524
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,780
-Are you alright ? 
-Yes..

525
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:16,360
For the next two days, make sure that 
your boy doesn't ride the bicycle and

526
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:18,410
indulge in any 
strenuous physical activity.

527
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,230
-Okay, doctor. 
-You can go...

528
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:21,790
-Slowly... 
-Slowly...

529
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:26,370
What is this for, grandpa?

530
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:29,690
Life is like a theatrical play.

531
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:34,900
On this stage, 
one encounters unimagined experiences.

532
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:41,260
If you write those memories in a book 
like this, from fading away with time,

533
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:45,440
they will stay alive forever.

534
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:48,440
Then, can I write about that 
boy who rides the bicycle?

535
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:49,270
Yes.

536
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:54,490
But he got bruised because of me. 
Do you think he will be friends with me?

537
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:55,930
Why wouldn't he be friends with you?

538
00:29:56,570 --> 00:29:59,260
Friendship gets stronger 
when there are problems.

539
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:00,380
[laughs]

540
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:18,920
Father, I want to go out 
and play with my friends.

541
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:21,080
No, son. Let's play chess.

542
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:24,680
I don't like this game. 
At least give me my bicycle.

543
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:29,160
Just be patient. Once you are 
healed, I will give it to you.

544
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:32,490
-Mahi, take your medicine. 
-I don't want it. I will not take it.

545
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:33,390
Hey..

546
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:41,290
Come, let's play.

547
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:42,560
Uhuh!

548
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:48,260
[indistinct children chatter]

549
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:53,340
[fire crackling]

550
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,980
Do you know how to take a picture? 
-I do.

551
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:10,290
Will you take mine?

552
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:15,240
Dad, will you teach me photography?

553
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:21,250
Every photograph needs to have a story. 
There should be life in every photograph.

554
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,830
Look there. Look at that on 
the tree... [camera clicks]

555
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:28,910
As time passes, many things that 
have touched our heart are forgotten.

556
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:29,670
[camera clicks]

557
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:33,620
If those kind of beautiful memories 
aree captured in a photograph,

558
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:35,320
they will remain with us forever. 
[camera clicks]

559
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:38,820
Uhuh!

560
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:42,600
Hey!

561
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:46,280
What's up, my little darling? 
Why are you dull?

562
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,520
The boy who rides the 
bicycle isn't coming.

563
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:50,360
You have a lot of friends, don't you?

564
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:53,370
He told me that he 
will take my photograph.

565
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:57,610
Is that all? 
I will get the photo of my angel taken.

566
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,180
-No, I don't want to come. 
-Why?

567
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:01,700
What if the bicycle boy 
comes here, after we leave?

568
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:05,110
-Listen to your grandpa, darling. Come. 
-Hmm...

569
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:08,780
I will return after giving your father 
his lunch. You sit and watch TV.

570
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,080
-I'll go and give him his lunch. 
-No, son. I'll go.

571
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:15,150
I will not run. I will walk slowly. 
Please, mother. Please... Please...

572
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:17,620
Okay, careful.

573
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,390
Little girl, keep your head straight.

574
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:35,410
Smile. Smile a little.

575
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:38,930
Like this...

576
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:40,430
Look at the camera lens.

577
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:41,640
This side..

578
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,340
I will count one, two and three, 
you'll have to flash a beautiful smile.

579
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:48,160
Okay?

580
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:50,310
One... two...

581
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,350
-Father... 
-Three.

582
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:52,000
[gasps]

583
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,170
[laughs]

584
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,630
That's good. Look at me. [camera clicks]

585
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:00,250
Sir, Photos will be ready in two 
days. Let me give you the receipt.

586
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:01,950
I will come and click it.

587
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,830
-Will you take my picture? 
-Yes.

588
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:11,410
Mwah!

589
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:55,360
-Hi. 
-Hi, please come.

590
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:55,830
Yeah.

591
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,780
You have such a nice place.

592
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:13,310
Hey, isn't that you?

593
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:15,890
Not bad. You did recognize me.

594
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:18,530
The thing is that... This diary is the 
main reason for me to recognise you

595
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:20,210
than that photograph. Look.

596
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:23,210
Reading: Just as I saw the 
heroine on the TV yesterday,

597
00:34:23,410 --> 00:34:26,670
I jumped on the guy who rode a bicycle.

598
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:29,950
It means you jumped on 
my bicycle intentionally?

599
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:33,780
All these days, I was under the impression 
that I was responsible for that accident.

600
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:38,290
-Sorry... Sorry... Sorry... 
-It's okay.

601
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:42,930
Anyways, how can you not 
have a single photo of yours?

602
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:45,420
I lost a few of them 
when we changed houses...

603
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:46,480
and a few of them when 
we changed places.

604
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:48,740
And also, I lost them 
from my memories as well.

605
00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:51,760
Thank you.

606
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:59,110
As I didn't have photos, I have no memory 
of how I looked when I was younger.

607
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:01,920
That was the reason why I had to 
ask if the girl in that photo was me.

608
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,850
It's ok. Well, what do you do?

609
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:07,700
Film heroine... I'm trying for that role.

610
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,960
Oh yeah. You are fond of 
acting since childhood, right?

611
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:11,440
Yeah.

612
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,630
What's the status of your trails?

613
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:16,740
I am attending auditions. It's a 
very competitive industry. Let's see.

614
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:25,230
Your work is really superb. There is a 
mysterious beauty in these photographs.

615
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:27,240
It's because of special people like you.

616
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,050
Thank you.

617
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:37,410
-Wow! How many years has it been? 
-Eighteen years.

618
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:40,140
Thanks. I will leave now.

619
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,080
We met after a very long 
time. Let's have dinner first.

620
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:44,930
And then, I will drop you. 
What do you say?

621
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:48,820
-Umm... Some other time. 
-When? After another eighteen years?

622
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:52,590
Oh! No... No... No... 
Okay, let's go.

You are the reason I 
became a photographer.

my company after you.

your phone is ringing.

00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:50,630
Answer the phone and tell that 
I'll call back in half an hour.

660
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:52,390
I love you.

661
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,290
And I miss you so much.

662
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:56,420
Who are you?

Hello, who is this?

664
00:39:58,830 --> 00:39:59,650
Isn't Varsha there?

665
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:02,060
She is at the beauty parlour. 
Who are you?

666
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:06,240
It's okay. Tell her 
that her fiance called.

667
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:08,550
And also, tell her that I miss her.

668
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:39,750
They have shortlisted six of us 
out of the 25 who have attended.

669
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:42,360
Six heroines in this film? 
-No!

670
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:45,920
The director is going to take the 
audition of six of us and select.

671
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:49,300
One chance... Just one 
chance... to prove myself.

672
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:50,770
Varsha?

673
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,690
Hmm... That's me.

674
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:54,300
The director has selected you.

675
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:03,780
Narayana, take that girl with you, 
fix her make-up, give her a costume

676
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,280
And get her ready for the test shoot.

677
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,810
Madam, this is your dress.

678
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:17,540
Have you got any sense? How can give 
the heroine's costume to her body double?

679
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:20,130
Sorry madam, the dress isn't ready yet.

00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:22,380
Since the director said it was urgent...

681
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:23,810
Do you even know how 
much that dress costs?

682
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:25,780
Can't you differentiate between 
the heroine and her body double...

683
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:26,630
who gets paid on daily basis?

684
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:27,320
Sorry, madam.

685
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:29,710
If that heroine finds out, 
would she wear this dress ever again?

686
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,790
-Go and get another dress. 
-Okay, madam.

687
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:39,470
[weeps] 
[knocking on door]

688
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:56,470
So, you don't want to 
work as a body double?

689
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:59,130
Sorry, sir. I came here to 
bag the role of the heroine.

690
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:02,260
Everyone comes to this industry 
to become heroes and heroines.

691
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:04,840
Do you expect a warm welcome 
with a garland upon your arrival

692
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:06,450
and be declared as a heroine?

693
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,710
Do you think having just right skin 
tone and shape would fetch you the role?

694
00:42:09,090 --> 00:42:10,800
Why don't you go and take a 
good long look at yourself in the mirror?

695
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:13,330
Do you even know what acting means?

696
00:42:15,310 --> 00:42:19,560
Acting doesn't just mean using your 
words to express the emotion.

697
00:42:20,050 --> 00:42:21,990
You must use your body as well.

698
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:26,100
For example, anger.

699
00:42:26,370 --> 00:42:29,040
Anger springs from the heart...

700
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,940
but that emotion should be 
expressed through your entire body.

701
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:36,480
That is when you can charm 
people with your acting skill.

702
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:39,690
-You are Rudramadevi. 
-What about you?

703
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:45,570
I am... the enemy king who 
declared war on your kingdom.

704
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:47,790
-What will you do? 
-Hmm...

705
00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:51,730
Why do you need this?

706
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:55,020
Who wastes time talking to 
the enemy? Let's go to war.

707
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:57,020
Ah... come on...

708
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,140
Rudrama...

709
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:05,990
[groans]

710
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:08,600
-Hey... 
-[groans]

711
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:14,110
Varsha... Varsha...

712
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:18,380
Varsha... Varsha...

713
00:43:24,730 --> 00:43:26,680
Grandpa, get up.

714
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,650
You acted really well, Grandpa...

715
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:31,460
Let's start again, Grandpa. Get up...

716
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:34,440
Grandpa... Grandpa...

717
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:40,660
[weeps]

718
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:44,460
Mom, ask Grandpa to get up.

719
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:47,900
Grandpa is no more.

720
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:50,290
He is right here, isn't he?

721
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:54,670
Grandpa went to the Gods.

722
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:57,600
I want my grandpa.

723
00:43:57,970 --> 00:44:00,730
-If not, I will go to Grandpa as well. 
-Oh no!

724
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:03,600
You shouldn't talk like that.

725
00:44:04,190 --> 00:44:09,200
If you do what Grandpa loves, 
Grandpa will be with you always.

726
00:44:15,550 --> 00:44:19,470
You like acting, right Grandpa?

727
00:44:19,810 --> 00:44:24,810
When I grow up, I will become an actress 
and take up many roles just like you.

728
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:27,870
That way you would always 
stay with me, right?

729
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:55,380
Save water.

730
00:44:56,190 --> 00:44:57,080
Thanks.

731
00:44:58,690 --> 00:44:59,690
How come you are here?

732
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:02,420
Stalking you! I want to abduct you.

733
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:04,370
[scoffs] That will be of no use.

734
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:09,190
I am pretty much useless to 
everybody and it's a huge waste of time.

735
00:45:10,850 --> 00:45:11,560
Who said that?

736
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:13,010
Does it matter?

737
00:45:13,850 --> 00:45:15,690
I have been auditioning for three years.

738
00:45:16,190 --> 00:45:17,470
Nobody selected me.

739
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:20,090
Some people don't want me to act.

740
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,020
Some people don't like my action.

741
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:23,750
And, I don't want to quit acting.

742
00:45:23,950 --> 00:45:27,520
If we get sad just because it is 
nightfall, we will miss out on the stars.

743
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:31,590
If you are in grief because you 
have lost, you will miss success.

744
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:32,440
It's that simple.

745
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,380
It can be called as your 
failure only if you don't try,

746
00:45:35,610 --> 00:45:37,180
Someones's rejection 
has nothing to do with it.

747
00:45:38,850 --> 00:45:41,690
Your eyes are enough, 
Varsha... to know that you can act.

748
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:46,280
One thing is for sure.

749
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:47,880
The earth is round...

750
00:45:48,550 --> 00:45:52,680
and so every rejection that you faced, 
will be turned into a welcome.

751
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:53,600
Trust me.

752
00:45:55,750 --> 00:46:01,710
[water dripping]

753
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:44,790
Why did you ask me to come here?

754
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:45,990
Look there.

755
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:06,640
Congratulations, Varsha!

756
00:47:06,670 --> 00:47:08,290
Hey... How did you know?

757
00:47:08,510 --> 00:47:10,360
Your ad has gone viral on YouTube.

758
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:19,820
Oh!

759
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:32,360
-I saw your ad. It's really good. 
-Thank you, sir.

760
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:35,630
Very expressive eyes 
and natural performance.

761
00:47:35,730 --> 00:47:36,440
Thank you, sir.

762
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:38,720
I think you are the 
right fit for my script.

763
00:47:39,310 --> 00:47:41,810
If you are okay with it, my co-directors 
will fill you in on the dates.

764
00:47:42,010 --> 00:47:43,870
We can go for shoot in one week.

765
00:47:45,190 --> 00:47:46,060
I am in it, sir.

766
00:47:48,850 --> 00:47:49,900
Mahi...

767
00:47:58,350 --> 00:47:59,160
Mahi...

768
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:07,500
I had never felt this excitement that I 
felt today to meet you, for any others.

769
00:48:08,810 --> 00:48:10,270
I got an offer as a heroine.

770
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:12,390
Such a great piece of 
news with this low tone?

771
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:14,440
You should be so loud that 
the entire city hears it.

772
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:17,290
Shouts: Varsha has become a heroine!

773
00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:32,580
"La... La... La... 
My dream has come true..."

774
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:40,440
"La... La... La... 
I'm here because of you..."

775
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:41,960
Action!

776
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:45,680
"So many rays of light for the eyes!"

777
00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:49,700
"So many prances from those smiling lips!"

778
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:54,010
"A new me is born..."

779
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:57,440
"...from my past"

780
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:05,410
"Two different dreams, 
two different thoughts have met"

781
00:49:07,310 --> 00:49:11,110
"Two different hearts, 
two different bonds"

782
00:49:11,390 --> 00:49:14,640
"are sprinting together"

783
00:49:15,150 --> 00:49:21,080
"Two different dreams, 
two different thoughts have met"

784
00:49:23,150 --> 00:49:27,010
"Two different hearts, 
two different bonds are running about"

785
00:49:27,210 --> 00:49:30,940
"are sprinting together"

786
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:37,510
"La... La... La... 
My dream has come true..."

787
00:49:39,450 --> 00:49:45,410
"La... La... La... 
I'm here because of you..."

788
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:07,280
"Are those the stars that 
have caught the wings?"

789
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:11,150
"Are those untangled calculations?"

790
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:17,020
"I am like the night that 
has caught the moonlight. "

791
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:22,110
"Every minute is changing as drastically"

792
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:25,900
"as the seasons"

793
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:30,300
"I walk beside you and ask my heart"

794
00:50:30,650 --> 00:50:35,530
"who else can be above you?' "

795
00:50:35,850 --> 00:50:41,810
"Two different dreams, 
two different thoughts have met"

796
00:50:43,770 --> 00:50:47,620
"Two different hearts, 
two different bonds"

797
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:50,590
"are sprinting together"

798
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:57,560
"Two different dreams, 
two different thoughts have met"

799
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:03,510
"Two different hearts, 
two different bonds are running about"

800
00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:06,280
"are sprinting together"

801
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:07,760
-Action! 
-Oh!

802
00:51:08,350 --> 00:51:10,270
-"Like the words that can't be expressed" 
-One more.

803
00:51:10,950 --> 00:51:11,610
One more.

804
00:51:11,710 --> 00:51:15,040
Varsha, focus please. Just imagine that 
you are with your boyfriend.

805
00:51:15,670 --> 00:51:17,780
-Just feel that... Okay? 
-Okay, sir.

806
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:20,580
You can do it. You can do it 
now... Okay? Okay. Go for take.

807
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:25,170
"In the shadow of your head,"

808
00:51:25,330 --> 00:51:30,510
"my head sees comfort 
and a place to rest"

809
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:34,690
"Of the many loves in my life"

810
00:51:35,470 --> 00:51:37,280
"I didn't know that my heart 
was missing this kind. "

811
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:38,280
Shot okay!

812
00:51:40,850 --> 00:51:46,830
"Two different dreams, 
two different thoughts have met"

813
00:51:48,650 --> 00:51:52,460
"Two different hearts, 
two different bonds"

814
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:55,610
"are sprinting together"

815
00:51:56,560 --> 00:52:02,540
"Two different dreams, 
two different thoughts have met"

816
00:52:04,350 --> 00:52:07,280
"Two different hearts..." 
[phone rings]

817
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:08,110
Hello, sir.

818
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:09,550
Congratulations, Varsha.

819
00:52:09,650 --> 00:52:10,450
What happened, sir?

820
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:13,590
I just saw the first copy of our 
movie. It came out really well.

821
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:15,780
Really, sir?

822
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:16,740
Just mark my words.

823
00:52:17,070 --> 00:52:18,620
You will become a very top heroine.

824
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:21,220
Thank you, sir. Thank you so much.

825
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:32,410
[aeroplane whizzing]

826
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:42,200
Today, I am so happy!

827
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:45,960
Everyone who has seen the first copy 
said that the movie was a great hit.

828
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:46,620
Congratulations!

829
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:48,550
Thank you.

830
00:52:49,790 --> 00:52:53,440
From the next week, Varsha's time 
will start on the silver screen.

831
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:55,760
I am going to be a big star.

832
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:05,260
-And this is all because of you, Mahi! 
-This is all your talent.

833
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,620
-Don't say you didn't do anything, Mahi. 
-What did I do?

834
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:11,920
I was right here before you came. I had 
the same amount of talent before as well.

835
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:14,540
I have been trying since three years.

836
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:18,960
It's the same dog and pony 
show. It was of no use.

837
00:53:19,330 --> 00:53:23,210
I used to feel so disgusted to even look 
at the mirror after going back home.

838
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:28,280
And everyone's words 'you are a failure' 
echoed in my mind in Dolby Atmos sound.

839
00:53:29,370 --> 00:53:33,400
I laughed and it immediately 
followed it with tears and vice versa.

840
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:37,410
And I was constantly scared that if I 
stopped laughing, I would start crying.

841
00:53:44,210 --> 00:53:49,120
You came into my life... [imitates gunfire 
sound] And my life changed overnight.

842
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:51,610
Varsha, the heroine!

843
00:53:54,010 --> 00:53:56,070
If you had come into my life earlier,

844
00:53:56,340 --> 00:53:58,500
I would have had this 
happiness much earlier.

845
00:53:59,670 --> 00:54:00,980
See, I didn't remember you...

846
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:02,860
But you remembered me, right?

847
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:06,220
Didn't you ever feel 
like searching for me?

848
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:09,550
Didn't you ever want 
to meet me once again?

849
00:54:12,070 --> 00:54:13,840
Why didn't you come earlier, Mahi?

850
00:54:14,370 --> 00:54:16,110
You could have come for me.

851
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:19,880
When we were young, 
you were with me and it made me happy.

852
00:54:20,750 --> 00:54:23,540
And now you are with me and 
once again, I am very happy.

853
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:26,280
This equation is very simple.

854
00:54:26,890 --> 00:54:30,350
When you are beside me, 
I will be very happy. That's it!

855
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:33,160
Will you stay with me?

856
00:54:35,020 --> 00:54:36,990
Will you stay with me all my life?

857
00:54:39,110 --> 00:54:44,230
Huh? Promise me.

858
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:48,280
Promise me that you will 
stay with me my entire life.

859
00:55:29,530 --> 00:55:32,690

[phone rings]

865
00:58:28,370 --> 00:58:31,250
Oh, crap! 37 missed calls

866
00:58:32,830 --> 00:58:33,270
Hello...

867
00:58:33,710 --> 00:58:34,810
-Where are you?  
-Geetha...

868
00:58:34,910 --> 00:58:36,520
It's getting late to the flight 
time. Come fast to the airport.

869
00:58:36,620 --> 00:58:38,220
Sorry... Sorry... Sorry... 
I will be there in fifteen minutes.

870
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:39,660
-Fine. Just get here quickly.  
-Hmm.

871
00:58:39,870 --> 00:58:42,060
Hey Geeta... Did you get my luggage?

872
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:43,500
-Yes, I did.  
-Thank God!

873
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:44,950
Well... Listen...

874
00:58:45,250 --> 00:58:46,970
-Would it be late?  
-No... No... No delay.

875
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:48,170
I will be there in fifteen minutes.

876
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:49,950
-Yeah. Okay, bye.  
-Okay, bye

877
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:57,920
Mahi...

878
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:18,510
Mahi... Mahi...

879
00:59:19,060 --> 00:59:21,460
Why did you sleep here? 
Get up... Get up.

880
00:59:21,660 --> 00:59:22,390
Tsk!

881
00:59:27,510 --> 00:59:29,000
Hey Mahi, are you okay?

882
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:35,530
Varsha is here. 
She slept here last night.

883
00:59:36,220 --> 00:59:37,110
What? Varsha?

884
00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:56,710
[phone rings] 
Mahi...

885
01:00:00,490 --> 01:00:01,260
Hello...

886
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:03,670
We are calling from Nova 
Hospital... Is this Mahi?

887
01:00:03,820 --> 01:00:05,180
No, I am Mahi's friend. Please tell me.

888
01:00:05,260 --> 01:00:06,600
His medical reports have come.

889
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:08,700
The doctor has asked him to get 
admitted in the hospital immediately.

890
01:00:09,270 --> 01:00:11,560
Admit? Why? What happened to Mahi?

891
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:15,310
We don't know those details, sir. 
Please inform Mahi when you see him.

892
01:00:15,580 --> 01:00:16,680
Well... Hello... Hello.

893
01:00:23,660 --> 01:00:25,820
Hey, give me the phone. 
Varsha is not over upstairs.

894
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:30,000
-Dialer tone: The number you're calling...  
-What's with getting admitted in hospital?

895
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:32,000
Dialer tone: 
...is not reachable at the moment.

896
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:34,180
-Dialer tone: Please call back in sometime  
-Mahi?

897
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:36,630
It says Varsha's phone 
to be not reachable.

898
01:00:37,470 --> 01:00:40,840
Hey! Why are you talking about Varsha 
when I was asking you about the hospital?

899
01:00:40,870 --> 01:00:41,840
What is happening to you?

900
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:43,780
Nothing. It's a regular checkup.

901
01:00:44,550 --> 01:00:47,760
Mahi, you are hiding something from 
me. Tell me what happened. Please.

902
01:00:52,010 --> 01:00:54,550
We performed all the tests. 
Your son has a heart problem.

903
01:00:55,330 --> 01:00:56,400
Heart problem?

904
01:01:01,930 --> 01:01:04,860
The nerves of your son's 
heart are very weak.

905
01:01:05,790 --> 01:01:09,250
The medical terminology for this 
condition is Atrial fibrillation.

906
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:15,850
The symptoms include breathlessness, 
chest pains, dizziness, fainting spells.

907
01:01:16,270 --> 01:01:17,750
It doesn't matter how much 
the medical expenses cost.

908
01:01:18,340 --> 01:01:21,680
I would even sell my photo 
studio. But please save him.

909
01:01:22,150 --> 01:01:26,010
There is no solution to this problem. All 
that can be done is taking precautions.

910
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:31,930
How could you state such a huge 
problem in a simple manner?

911
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:36,500
It's not worrisome because I 
didn't get this problem recently.

912
01:01:37,470 --> 01:01:38,960
This has been with me 
right from my childhood.

913
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:43,190
The only thing that I have to do 
is go for my monthly checkups

914
01:01:43,230 --> 01:01:45,790
and take regular meditation. Nothing more. 
[message notification tone]

915
01:01:45,980 --> 01:01:47,160
I will visit the hospital now.

916
01:01:59,460 --> 01:02:00,500
Hi Mahi...

917
01:02:00,790 --> 01:02:02,480
When I came to see you, 
you were asleep.

918
01:02:02,580 --> 01:02:03,810
That's why, I didn't wake you up.

919
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:05,530
I am going to Ooty...

920
01:02:05,670 --> 01:02:08,360
I wanted to tell this to you 
yesterday. But I forgot...

921
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:10,500
I visit that place every year for 
my birthday. That's my custom.

922
01:02:11,710 --> 01:02:13,180
But for the first time,

923
01:02:13,470 --> 01:02:16,360
I will be having the feeling of missing 
you, even with everyone around me.

924
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:17,750
It's okay.

925
01:02:17,950 --> 01:02:19,180
Now, I will go to Ooty

926
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:23,660
and revisit those old places where 
we had our childhood memories.

927
01:02:24,190 --> 01:02:25,290
I will find you in these memories.

928
01:02:25,670 --> 01:02:28,650
But, if you were here, this trip 
would have become a life-long memory.

929
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:32,760
Anyhow, bye. 
I'll be back soon.

930
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:41,110
Mahi...

931
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:43,230
Where are you going with that 
bag instead of going to the hospital?

932
01:02:44,570 --> 01:02:45,370
I am going to Ooty.

933
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,670
Hey! The doctor insisted that you 
go to the hospital immediately.

934
01:02:47,770 --> 01:02:49,410
I get the same kind of call 
every time from the hospital.

935
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:50,930
Nothing has happened so far.

936
01:02:51,580 --> 01:02:52,940
-Alright. But still... 
-Hey...

937
01:02:54,710 --> 01:02:57,950
It doesn't matter how I am. But as long 
as I am with Varsha, I will be happy.

938
01:02:58,260 --> 01:03:00,450
Buddy, just give it 
another thought. Please.

939
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:04,290
She wants me to be with her.

940
01:03:05,270 --> 01:03:07,110
-Bye... 
-Hey... Hey... Hey...

941
01:03:08,830 --> 01:03:11,340
-Has Mahi arrived?  
-He is not responding, sir.

942
01:03:11,830 --> 01:03:13,310
I informed his friend.

943
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:15,150
Do you have any idea about 
the patient's condition?

944
01:03:15,570 --> 01:03:17,590
When I told you that it is 
urgent, it means he is in danger.

945
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:18,770
Call him immediately.

you are calling is switched off.

01:03:41,490 --> 01:03:42,420
What happened?

951
01:03:43,300 --> 01:03:44,870
His mobile is switched off.

952
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:49,460
-Sir, anything serious. 
-Yes

953
01:03:50,420 --> 01:03:52,230
He is an Atrial fibrillation patient.

954
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:54,430
Almost all of his 
heart vessels are blocked.

955
01:03:54,530 --> 01:03:56,270
His blood circulation 
is irregular as well.

956
01:03:56,370 --> 01:03:58,240
We need to start his 
treatment immediately.

957
01:03:58,570 --> 01:04:02,130
With each delay, his condition 
becomes even more critical.

958
01:04:08,590 --> 01:04:10,830
Anything can happen at any moment.

959
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:52,470
Varsha, are you okay?

960
01:04:53,050 --> 01:04:53,610
Hmm.

961
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:55,750
Hey! You also come.

962
01:04:55,950 --> 01:04:57,930
I will go. My mother must 
be waiting for me at home.

963
01:04:58,080 --> 01:04:59,870
Call me after you finish your works. 
We will meet in the evening.

964
01:04:59,990 --> 01:05:01,150
-Okay, bye. 
-Okay, bye.

01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:37,670
MAHI

968
01:05:48,870 --> 01:05:49,940
Madam, you are...

969
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:52,050
Are you Varsha, the heroine?

970
01:05:52,150 --> 01:05:53,730
-Yes, I am. 
-Heroine Varsha has come.

971
01:05:53,730 --> 01:05:54,370
Come you guys, come.

972
01:05:54,930 --> 01:05:57,090
Madam, we have all seen you on YouTube.

973
01:05:57,340 --> 01:05:58,780
You are very beautiful, madam.

974
01:05:58,910 --> 01:06:00,860
-Madam, can we get a selfie, please? 
-Okay.

975
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:01,970
[camera clicks]

976
01:06:02,170 --> 01:06:05,020
It seems like someone has 
planned by his actions.

[ritualistic bell ringing] 
Mahi... Mahi...

978
01:06:11,450 --> 01:06:11,960
Mahi...

979
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:14,040
Why would Mahi be here?

980
01:06:15,070 --> 01:06:16,280
-Are you mad? 
-Mahi.

981
01:06:16,550 --> 01:06:17,330
-Varsha. 
-Mahi.

982
01:06:19,150 --> 01:06:20,600
Mahi, I know that you are here.

983
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:21,760
Mahi, come out.

984
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:23,890
Varsha, Varsha...

985
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:25,500
Varsha... Listen to me.

986
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:32,110
Varsha. 
[honks]

987
01:06:32,310 --> 01:06:33,790
Varsha, watch out the jeep.

988
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:44,090
I didn't think 
that you would come.

989
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:45,600
You came without informing me.

990
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:47,950
I was scared if it may take 
another 18 years to meet you again.

991
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:48,880
Which is why, I came.

992
01:06:50,180 --> 01:06:51,330
I want to see Ooty with you.

993
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:52,170
Hmm.

994
01:06:55,180 --> 01:06:57,190
I was confused when I 
woke up in the morning.

995
01:06:57,970 --> 01:06:59,140
I didn't have a clue where I was.

996
01:06:59,550 --> 01:07:01,420
I got clarity only 
after seeing you downstairs.

997
01:07:01,970 --> 01:07:05,090
The flight was already late, mobile 
was switched off and I wasn't ready.

998
01:07:05,150 --> 01:07:07,770
One after the other... 
[sighs]

999
01:07:09,930 --> 01:07:12,100
Don't you remember anything about 
what had happened last night?

1000
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:13,320
Uh-huh!

1001
01:07:14,890 --> 01:07:15,840
Did I beat up someone?

1002
01:07:17,430 --> 01:07:18,950
Did I trouble you a lot?

1003
01:07:21,030 --> 01:07:21,560
Mahi.

1004
01:07:22,010 --> 01:07:23,710
Tell me, what happened?

1005
01:07:24,050 --> 01:07:24,600
It's nothing.

1006
01:07:25,710 --> 01:07:27,840
You were unconscious while you were 
in a conversation at the party.

1007
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:32,250
I thought what people might think if I 
take you to your flat in that situation.

1008
01:07:32,660 --> 01:07:34,770
So, I brought you home and made 
you sleep there. That's all.

1009
01:07:38,510 --> 01:07:39,030
Mahi.

1010
01:07:39,930 --> 01:07:40,530
Thank you.

1011
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:53,640
Have you lost in your thoughts?

1012
01:07:54,850 --> 01:07:58,540
This village, 
the air over here and the sand smell...

1013
01:08:00,460 --> 01:08:02,470
All my childhood memories are here.

1014
01:08:03,470 --> 01:08:04,300
How pure were those days!

1015
01:08:05,100 --> 01:08:06,700
It was all play in the day time

1016
01:08:07,110 --> 01:08:08,330
and nights were only for sleep.

1017
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:20,150
"It's the same village"

1018
01:08:20,390 --> 01:08:21,950
"The same stream"

1019
01:08:22,130 --> 01:08:25,100
"It's the same excitement in the air"

1020
01:08:25,420 --> 01:08:31,360
"We remain silent before we come together"

1021
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:35,320
"It's the same you and the same me" 
-That is my school.

1022
01:08:35,550 --> 01:08:37,700
"But our story has changed" 
-Is it? What a coincidence!

1023
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:38,480
This is my school.

1024
01:08:38,850 --> 01:08:42,010
-"We are like rivers..." 
-Really?

1025
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:44,380
"...that merge into the ocean"

1026
01:08:44,580 --> 01:08:50,490
"These moments of naughtiness 
have turned into"

1027
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:57,000
" lasting memories"

1028
01:08:59,050 --> 01:09:04,980
"It's an abode of friendship 
beyond worldly things"

1029
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:11,650
"Let's relive the springs of our past"

1030
01:09:12,430 --> 01:09:18,390
"It's an abode of friendship 
beyond wordly things"

1031
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:25,050
"Let's relive the springs of our past"

1032
01:09:33,100 --> 01:09:38,680
"When the rain drizzles 
on the tiny lives,"

1033
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:45,370
"The surprised heart holds a lot of tunes"

1034
01:09:46,530 --> 01:09:52,220
"Those old memories greeting us"

1035
01:09:53,240 --> 01:09:58,140
"Our meetings have led to 
realising new shades"

1036
01:09:58,330 --> 01:10:04,240
"Has that friendship come to you"

1037
01:10:05,050 --> 01:10:10,740
"And changed into love?"

1038
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:17,660
"If that dream becomes true..."

1039
01:10:18,410 --> 01:10:23,000
"...then our worlds get united"

1040
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:27,800
Right from my childhood, 
I held the desire to climb that mountain.

1041
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:29,590
But that never happened.

1042
01:10:29,790 --> 01:10:32,420
[birds chirping]

1043
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:33,140
Let's climb now.

1044
01:10:34,100 --> 01:10:35,870
Now? 
No.

1045
01:10:36,390 --> 01:10:38,190
By the time we return, 
it will be night.

1046
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:43,080
Why should we return? 
Let's stay there tonight.

1047
01:10:43,720 --> 01:10:46,210
-Are you crazy? 
-Why? Are you scared?

1048
01:10:47,300 --> 01:10:48,390
Varsha and fear?

1049
01:10:49,050 --> 01:10:50,410
You have hurt my ego.

1050
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:52,070
I will stay over the entire night.

1051
01:10:52,930 --> 01:10:54,270
Let's see who gets there first.

1052
01:10:54,660 --> 01:10:58,960
[chuckles]

1053
01:11:05,130 --> 01:11:07,340
[panting]

1054
01:11:07,540 --> 01:11:11,930
[chuckles]

1055
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:13,100
Come on.

1056
01:11:14,930 --> 01:11:20,870
[panting]

1057
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:30,630
Mahi, what happened?

1058
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:31,840
Are you okay?

1059
01:11:34,930 --> 01:11:35,430
Hey...

1060
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:36,630
Catch me if you can.

1061
01:11:40,300 --> 01:11:41,080
This is cheating.

1062
01:11:49,430 --> 01:11:50,370
Wow.

1063
01:11:52,580 --> 01:11:54,560
What an amazing place!

1064
01:11:54,660 --> 01:11:55,880
Mahi...

1065
01:11:57,020 --> 01:12:02,820
Thank you, Mahi... 
[reverberates]

1066
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:07,920
Did you hear my friends thanking?

1067
01:12:08,930 --> 01:12:13,230
We love you, Varsha madam... 
[reverberates]

1068
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:15,700
See, how many fans of yours are 
expressing their love for you.

1069
01:12:15,820 --> 01:12:20,360
"It's the same childhood 
we shared as individuals"

1070
01:12:21,370 --> 01:12:24,100
"The paths that brought us together..."

1071
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:26,870
-"...are the same" 
-Mahi, let's dance.

1072
01:12:27,140 --> 01:12:28,670
Varsha, I don't know how to dance.

1073
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:29,940
Tsk! 
I am with you, aren't I?

1074
01:12:30,310 --> 01:12:33,020
Anyways, it's your luck that the 
heroine wants to dance with you.

1075
01:12:33,740 --> 01:12:34,570
Don't confuse.

1076
01:12:35,130 --> 01:12:36,280
Look into my eyes.

1077
01:12:37,020 --> 01:12:38,600
Enjoy the breeze and the music.

1078
01:12:39,350 --> 01:12:39,830
Come.

1079
01:12:40,010 --> 01:12:45,960
"Has that friendship come to you"

1080
01:12:46,650 --> 01:12:52,610
"And changed into love?"

1081
01:12:53,260 --> 01:12:59,210
"If that dream becomes true..."

1082
01:13:00,110 --> 01:13:04,490
"...then our worlds get united"

1083
01:13:04,610 --> 01:13:10,490
"It's an abode of friendship 
beyond worldly things"

1084
01:13:11,380 --> 01:13:17,340
"Let's relive the springs of our past"

1085
01:13:25,260 --> 01:13:26,070
What are you thinking?

1086
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:29,140
If we stay here forever,

1087
01:13:29,460 --> 01:13:32,450
we can be happy forever 
by counting the stars!

1088
01:13:34,010 --> 01:13:35,680
-You might get bored. 
-Tsk!

1089
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:38,550
I will never be bored with you.

1090
01:13:40,100 --> 01:13:41,360
By the way, what are you thinking?

1091
01:13:43,350 --> 01:13:44,320
I'm wondering what the 
future would be like.

1092
01:13:45,810 --> 01:13:48,930
I will think about it when I get 
married and become a mother but not now.

1093
01:13:49,510 --> 01:13:50,910
-How many children do you want? 
-Two.

1094
01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:52,050
How many do you want?

1095
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:53,460
Even I want two kids.

1096
01:13:55,100 --> 01:13:56,070
Where would you settle down?

1097
01:13:56,270 --> 01:13:56,930
I am not particular.

1098
01:13:57,470 --> 01:13:58,330
I have my Photo studio.

1099
01:13:58,600 --> 01:13:59,710
I will take photographs 
and live my life.

1100
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:02,130
-What about you? 
-I will stay where my husband wants to.

1101
01:14:07,050 --> 01:14:07,560
What else?

1102
01:14:13,640 --> 01:14:17,490
Life gives surprises to 
everyone at a moment.

1103
01:14:18,510 --> 01:14:22,050
They would be the happiest people 
ever if one can identify those.

1104
01:14:23,390 --> 01:14:25,080
You are the surprise in my life, Varsha.

1105
01:14:28,870 --> 01:14:30,590
If I had known that I would be 
with you in a place like this,

1106
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:34,220
I would have travelled 
hundreds of kilometers.

1107
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:35,550
Do you know something?

1108
01:14:36,930 --> 01:14:38,970
Every time that my 
heartbeat so fast...

1109
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:42,430
everyone scares that something 
terrible would happen to me.

1110
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:45,140
But when you expressed your love for me,

1111
01:14:45,970 --> 01:14:48,050
my heart pounded so 
fast like never before.

1112
01:14:50,010 --> 01:14:51,470
I understood the very moment, Varsha.

1113
01:14:52,760 --> 01:14:54,420
That nothing will happen to 
me if you are by my side.

1114
01:14:57,610 --> 01:14:58,520
I love you Varsha.

1115
01:14:59,390 --> 01:15:01,160
I thought of proposing the 
very next day I met you,

1116
01:15:03,390 --> 01:15:07,040
But I stopped after knowing that 
there is someone else in your life.

1117
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:10,420
It's just me who stopped!

1118
01:15:11,430 --> 01:15:15,830
Both my heart and thoughts 
are travelling with you.

1119
01:15:16,280 --> 01:15:20,810
I am unable to stay away from 
you even after being with you.

1120
01:15:27,100 --> 01:15:29,110
You don't remember what 
you've told me on that night.

1121
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:33,260
And you haven't listened 
to what I said tonight.

1122
01:15:35,140 --> 01:15:36,020
That's probably how life works.

1123
01:15:45,430 --> 01:15:47,200
[door bell rings]

1124
01:15:47,300 --> 01:15:48,020
Coming...

1125
01:15:53,340 --> 01:15:55,100
-Who rang the bell? 
-No one is here.

1126
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:58,870
[birds chirping]

1127
01:16:06,410 --> 01:16:08,570
Mahi? What is this?

1128
01:16:08,770 --> 01:16:10,440
You didn't even tell me 
that you were coming.

1129
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:11,450
I wanted to surprise you.

1130
01:16:11,930 --> 01:16:14,050
Stop it. 
I'm feeling dizzy. Stop.

1131
01:16:15,570 --> 01:16:16,360
Mahi...

1132
01:16:18,210 --> 01:16:19,720
-How are you, my son? 
- I am doing good, mother.

1133
01:16:19,830 --> 01:16:22,200
You might be hungry. 
Come on, eat breakfast.

1134
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:41,070
Your smile makes you look handsome.

1135
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:43,100
You should always keep smiling.

1136
01:16:47,710 --> 01:16:50,280
[sighs] Varsha, cool.

1137
01:16:50,930 --> 01:16:54,090
You should tell mother 
about Mahi at any cost.

1138
01:17:01,300 --> 01:17:02,330
Wow, mother!

1139
01:17:02,530 --> 01:17:03,650
The saree is awesome.

1140
01:17:04,140 --> 01:17:05,380
-Do you like it? 
-Yeah.

1141
01:17:06,730 --> 01:17:09,370
I made this specially for your wedding.

1142
01:17:10,510 --> 01:17:11,540
It was delivered today.

1143
01:17:13,050 --> 01:17:14,600
-Mother. 
-See.

1144
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:16,860
You've become so thin after 
dieting so much.

1145
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:18,440
It's nice.

1146
01:17:19,510 --> 01:17:21,260
Mother, 
what is the need of all these things now?

1147
01:17:26,220 --> 01:17:28,370
When your father, who 
I loved so dearly,

1148
01:17:30,350 --> 01:17:32,780
suddenly betrayed us and abandoned us,

1149
01:17:34,470 --> 01:17:37,350
everyone pitied me.

1150
01:17:39,350 --> 01:17:43,110
That is when I decided that I 
should bring you up very well

1151
01:17:44,140 --> 01:17:45,950
and marry you off to a very nice guy.

1152
01:17:46,300 --> 01:17:47,290
Mother, please.

1153
01:17:49,390 --> 01:17:52,760
Varsha, Rahul isn't like your father.

1154
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:56,360
He has been waiting for 
you for three years.

1155
01:17:57,390 --> 01:17:58,640
Isn't that enough...

1156
01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:03,420
...to know that he would never 
let you go if he holds your hand?

1157
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:10,440
Are you going to invite 
your father to the wedding?

1158
01:18:11,300 --> 01:18:12,880
-Mom... 
-Don't invite him.

1159
01:18:13,430 --> 01:18:15,570
I don't like to see him.

1160
01:18:24,850 --> 01:18:26,670
I saw dad with another girl today.

1161
01:18:27,680 --> 01:18:29,460
Dad hugged her.

1162
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:33,400
I got angry after seeing that.  
[thundering]

1163
01:18:34,440 --> 01:18:37,920
How dare you question me all because 
she scribbled some nonsense?

1164
01:18:38,550 --> 01:18:40,020
She write out of imagination.

1165
01:18:41,780 --> 01:18:42,670
Or it isn't some nonsense either.

1166
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:45,040
She only wrote what she saw.

1167
01:18:45,680 --> 01:18:47,530
-You are the one who betrayed. 
-Hey!

1168
01:18:47,860 --> 01:18:49,290
-Why did you do so? 
-I will live the way that I want.

1169
01:18:49,790 --> 01:18:51,820
There would be no relation to us from now.

1170
01:18:52,070 --> 01:18:53,070
-Mind your bloody lives! 
-[groans]

1171
01:18:56,890 --> 01:18:59,100
Do you think we 
cannot survive without you?

1172
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:00,450
Get lost.

1173
01:19:11,550 --> 01:19:12,160
Mother.

1174
01:19:17,510 --> 01:19:18,430
Don't cry, mother.

1175
01:19:19,970 --> 01:19:21,150
Please mother, don't cry.

1176
01:19:22,510 --> 01:19:23,440
I am there for you.

1177
01:19:24,930 --> 01:19:25,670
Please, mother.

1178
01:20:07,910 --> 01:20:12,760
[breathes heavily]

1179
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:23,570
[breathes heavily]

1180
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:35,300
In unison: Happy birthday to you...

1181
01:20:38,130 --> 01:20:40,150
Every year it was my 
daughter who comes home.

1182
01:20:40,330 --> 01:20:42,750
Now, it's a heroine.

1183
01:20:43,590 --> 01:20:44,560
Happy Birthday!

1184
01:20:46,740 --> 01:20:48,150
May you live a long-life, son.

1185
01:20:54,130 --> 01:20:57,100
Tsk! 
I don't know what to do.

1186
01:20:58,160 --> 01:21:00,070
I don't know how to 
convince my mother.

1187
01:21:00,700 --> 01:21:04,690
And I don't know how to convey this to 
Rahul and when to tell this to Mahi.

1188
01:21:05,150 --> 01:21:07,520
Don't worry so much about what they want. 
What is it that you want?

1189
01:21:07,720 --> 01:21:10,660
Rahul has been waiting for me 
for the past three years.

1190
01:21:11,320 --> 01:21:13,570
But now, if I tell him that 
I don't like him any more

1191
01:21:13,790 --> 01:21:16,890
and that I no longer have feelings 
for him, isn't that betrayal?

1192
01:21:17,370 --> 01:21:19,920
If that's the case, having Mahi in your 
heart and getting married to Rahul,

1193
01:21:20,020 --> 01:21:20,860
what do you think that's called?

1194
01:21:22,950 --> 01:21:26,690
Because of your father's betrayal, your 
mother is still suffering the consequences

1195
01:21:26,890 --> 01:21:28,020
Don't repeat the same mistake.

1196
01:21:28,810 --> 01:21:30,860
Even if you get married to Rahul and 
stay with him for a hundred years,

1197
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:33,130
you will not be able to make 
him happy for even a moment.

1198
01:21:33,230 --> 01:21:34,280
And you will not be happy either.

1199
01:22:07,110 --> 01:22:09,200
-Hello, Murthy sir. 
-Hello, sir.

1200
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:10,700
Come in. 
Please take a seat.

1201
01:22:11,070 --> 01:22:12,780
Did you know that Rangarao sir is dead?

1202
01:22:13,070 --> 01:22:14,360
Mr. Rangarao?

1203
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:17,120
The one who is a stage artist 
and stays in Gandhinagar.

1204
01:22:17,220 --> 01:22:17,710
Hmm.

1205
01:22:17,810 --> 01:22:19,520
He doesn't have any relatives here.

1206
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:22,350
That's why they are taking 
his dead body to their hometown.

1207
01:22:22,410 --> 01:22:25,080
Oh no! 
Hey, where are you going?

1208
01:22:25,450 --> 01:22:27,710
Mahi, don't run. 
Wait.

1209
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:29,710
Hey, Mahi.

1210
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:07,430
Mahi...

1211
01:23:11,010 --> 01:23:13,900
I'll keep my favourite 
things in this box.

1212
01:23:14,200 --> 01:23:18,630
This is my treasure box. 
[phone rings]

1213
01:23:19,570 --> 01:23:21,290
-Tell me, Geeta. 
-Mahi, where are you?

1214
01:23:21,790 --> 01:23:24,030
-I am in the studio. 
-You haven't started yet, did you?

1215
01:23:24,230 --> 01:23:24,760
Uh-huh!

1216
01:23:25,480 --> 01:23:26,110
Which pub is it?

1217
01:23:26,470 --> 01:23:29,040
Sound and spirits. Both of us will be 
there in half an hour. You join us there.

1218
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:37,870
Hi, Varsha. 
Happy birthday.

1219
01:23:38,070 --> 01:23:38,880
Thank you, sir.

1220
01:23:38,980 --> 01:23:41,930
We would have had a grand celebration 
for your birthday if you were here.

1221
01:23:42,050 --> 01:23:42,490
But, we missed it.

1222
01:23:42,570 --> 01:23:45,610
But tomorrow, you shouldn't miss our 
movie's premiere show at any cost.

1223
01:23:45,710 --> 01:23:46,290
Oh!

1224
01:23:46,690 --> 01:23:47,150
Okay?

1225
01:23:47,450 --> 01:23:48,340
Yeah, sir. I'll be there.

1226
01:23:48,790 --> 01:23:49,400
Bye... Bye...

1227
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:50,580
Thank you, sir. 
Bye.

1228
01:23:56,330 --> 01:24:01,100
[laughs] 
[phone ringing]

1229
01:24:01,300 --> 01:24:02,530
You carry on. 
I'll join you.

1230
01:24:06,810 --> 01:24:07,530
Hi, Rahul.

1231
01:24:07,770 --> 01:24:09,490
-Happy birthday, Varsha.-Thanks.

1232
01:24:10,670 --> 01:24:13,270
I am sorry that I've called you lately. 
I've severe workload.

1233
01:24:13,570 --> 01:24:19,510
It's okay. 
[singing Bollywood song]

1234
01:24:22,420 --> 01:24:23,880
We both learned guitar together.

1235
01:24:24,330 --> 01:24:25,500
-He is my best friend. 
-Is it so?

1236
01:24:31,160 --> 01:24:33,590
What is it, Varsha? 
You seem very distant.

1237
01:24:34,130 --> 01:24:34,800
There is nothing as such.

1238
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:38,530
I came out with my friends as it's my 
birthday. Everyone is waiting for me.

1239
01:24:38,730 --> 01:24:40,760
-So...  
-Oh! Okay, no problem.

1240
01:24:41,130 --> 01:24:42,570
Have a great time, okay? 
Bye... Bye...

1241
01:24:42,770 --> 01:24:43,360
Thanks... 
[applauding]

1242
01:24:43,450 --> 01:24:44,300
It's okay.

1243
01:24:45,370 --> 01:24:47,830
-Hey! Who is he? 
-They both are friends it seems.

1244
01:24:48,340 --> 01:24:51,510
What I feel today... 
dates back to our student days.

1245
01:24:52,890 --> 01:24:54,540
It's been years since I held a guitar.

1246
01:24:55,690 --> 01:24:56,540
And it's been years since I met him.

1247
01:24:57,750 --> 01:24:59,100
And most importantly,

1248
01:25:00,350 --> 01:25:05,620
I met my childhood friend who gave 
many unforgettable memories in my life,

1249
01:25:06,140 --> 01:25:07,370
after eighteen years.

1250
01:25:10,630 --> 01:25:11,390
Happy birthday Varsha.

1251
01:25:12,030 --> 01:25:12,570
Thank you.

1252
01:25:12,770 --> 01:25:13,680
You are really special.

1253
01:25:15,030 --> 01:25:15,660
This one is for you.

1254
01:25:33,270 --> 01:25:39,270
"It's you... You are my companion"

1255
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:44,480
"We both have a story"

1256
01:25:44,810 --> 01:25:47,410
"And it's called as love"

1257
01:25:48,610 --> 01:25:52,240
"All my hopes and attention 
of the recent past..."

1258
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:56,190
"...I've been carrying them in 
my heart, do you know that?"

1259
01:25:56,310 --> 01:25:58,000
"I wrote many words"

1260
01:25:58,280 --> 01:26:03,810
"Looked towards you silently and 
hid them deep inside me"

1261
01:26:03,950 --> 01:26:07,090
"You are my heartbeat..."

1262
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:11,100
"You are my heartbeat..."

1263
01:26:11,650 --> 01:26:14,660
"You are my heartbeat..."

1264
01:26:19,310 --> 01:26:22,470
"You are my heartbeat..."

1265
01:26:23,120 --> 01:26:26,710
"You are my heartbeat..."

1266
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:30,120
"You are my heartbeat..."

1267
01:26:49,540 --> 01:26:53,180
"Knowing that you are the 
outcome for many of my dreams"

1268
01:26:53,370 --> 01:26:57,160
"my heart overflows with joy"

1269
01:26:57,230 --> 01:27:00,950
"If you ask me who am I?"

1270
01:27:01,080 --> 01:27:04,690
"Then I'll show you that it's you"

1271
01:27:04,950 --> 01:27:08,550
"Even if the distance alienate us"

1272
01:27:08,750 --> 01:27:12,660
"I have hidden you deep inside my heart"

1273
01:27:12,980 --> 01:27:16,330
"To make me see you with my soul..."

1274
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:20,540
"You have put yourself in my eyelids"

1275
01:27:20,860 --> 01:27:24,100
"You are my heartbeat..."

1276
01:27:24,580 --> 01:27:27,920
"You are my heartbeat..."

1277
01:27:28,410 --> 01:27:31,390
"You are my heartbeat..."

1278
01:27:50,910 --> 01:27:54,710
"Like a small breeze that touched you"

1279
01:27:54,810 --> 01:27:58,510
"has reached me as my life-breath"

1280
01:27:58,610 --> 01:28:02,280
"You've shared every word on your lip..."

1281
01:28:02,500 --> 01:28:06,220
"...to me in the form of love"

1282
01:28:06,390 --> 01:28:10,110
"I cannot live without you"

1283
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:14,010
"I swear on your love, 
I will remain forever"

1284
01:28:14,500 --> 01:28:17,810
"A world without you is emptiness"

1285
01:28:17,910 --> 01:28:21,900
"I got no meaning without you"

1286
01:28:22,230 --> 01:28:25,370
"You are my heartbeat..."

1287
01:28:26,100 --> 01:28:29,290
"You are my heartbeat..."

1288
01:28:29,900 --> 01:28:32,730
"You are my heartbeat..."

1289
01:28:37,560 --> 01:28:40,690
"You are my heartbeat..."

1290
01:28:41,360 --> 01:28:44,930
"You are my heartbeat..."

1291
01:28:45,170 --> 01:28:48,320
"You are my heartbeat..."

1292
01:28:57,680 --> 01:28:59,030
-Shall we sit here? 
-Yeah!

1293
01:28:59,640 --> 01:29:04,750
[cicadas critter]

1294
01:29:07,810 --> 01:29:11,530
I was apparently in an 
accident right before birth.

1295
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:15,330
And because of that my 
mother's amniotic fluid broke

1296
01:29:16,730 --> 01:29:19,750
and she was immediately 
operated for delivery.

1297
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:21,650
That is when the doctors found out that,

1298
01:29:23,150 --> 01:29:28,680
the umbilical cord was tied around my 
neck and acted like a hanging rope.

1299
01:29:29,910 --> 01:29:33,070
If I hadn't been in that accident, 
I wouldn't have been born.

1300
01:29:33,630 --> 01:29:35,040
I would have died in the womb.

1301
01:29:38,360 --> 01:29:41,740
I keep remembering this 
on my every birthday.

1302
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:46,190
God gave me a second 
life even before I was born,

1303
01:29:47,130 --> 01:29:49,170
so there must be a 
certain purpose for my life.

1304
01:29:50,020 --> 01:29:54,740
That is the reason that drives me to 
achieve some form of success in life.

1305
01:30:01,980 --> 01:30:04,040
I have become a little melodramatic. 
Sorry.

1306
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:07,650
It's okay. 
Friends are there for a reason to share.

1307
01:30:08,690 --> 01:30:11,390
Right from sharing a room rent 
to sharing this kind of melodrama.

1308
01:30:17,650 --> 01:30:18,380
When is your birthday?

1309
01:30:20,780 --> 01:30:22,820
It's already past twelve, right? 
It was yesterday.

1310
01:30:23,400 --> 01:30:24,540
-Yesterday? 
-Yeah.

1311
01:30:25,450 --> 01:30:26,550
-Really? 
-Yes.

1312
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:29,700
Unbelievable. 
What a coincidence!

1313
01:30:30,090 --> 01:30:30,490
Yeah!

1314
01:30:30,690 --> 01:30:33,090
-Happy birthday. 
-Happy birthday to both of us.

1315
01:30:33,590 --> 01:30:35,210
Mahi, why didn't you tell me this before?

1316
01:30:36,670 --> 01:30:39,810
Your birthday seemed more 
important to me than mine.

1317
01:30:41,440 --> 01:30:43,370
I wanted you to have all the attention.

1318
01:30:44,430 --> 01:30:49,110
I didn't want even a tiny bit of attention 
taken away from you. That is why...

1319
01:30:51,180 --> 01:30:51,760
Thanks.

1320
01:30:56,900 --> 01:30:58,950
Where were you all these years, Varsha?

1321
01:31:07,170 --> 01:31:08,800
I have to give you something. 
Come.

1322
01:31:09,340 --> 01:31:10,900
-What is it? 
-Surprise.

1323
01:31:11,740 --> 01:31:12,440
Why don't you tell me?

1324
01:31:13,470 --> 01:31:14,120
Can't you come with me?

1325
01:31:15,450 --> 01:31:15,910
Hmm.

1326
01:31:48,200 --> 01:31:49,420
I sat here, didn't I?

1327
01:31:51,070 --> 01:31:51,950
My grandfather sat there.

1328
01:31:53,690 --> 01:31:55,170
And your father sat here, taking my photo.

1329
01:31:57,610 --> 01:31:59,210
And you dlipped the lunch box there.

1330
01:31:59,410 --> 01:32:00,740
Father... [gasps] 
[lunch box clunks]

1331
01:32:02,770 --> 01:32:04,210
I saw you and laughed.

1332
01:32:08,710 --> 01:32:09,330
Close your eyes.

1333
01:32:09,780 --> 01:32:10,220
Huh?

1334
01:32:11,030 --> 01:32:12,980
-Just close your eyes. 
-Hmm.

1335
01:32:41,150 --> 01:32:43,190
I was sure you would come here one 
day and that's why I preserved it.

1336
01:33:59,430 --> 01:34:05,280
[phone ringing]

1337
01:34:21,650 --> 01:34:23,070
Hello, Varsha.

1338
01:34:23,410 --> 01:34:24,040
Good morning.

1339
01:34:24,530 --> 01:34:25,250
Did I disturb you?

1340
01:34:26,150 --> 01:34:27,800
I will call you in ten minutes, Rahul.

1341
01:34:28,330 --> 01:34:29,420
Okay. 
Take your time.

1342
01:34:30,030 --> 01:34:32,540
Hello, Varsha...Do you know where I am right now?

1343
01:34:32,640 --> 01:34:33,270
Where are you?

1344
01:34:33,700 --> 01:34:35,310
2,240 metres above the sea level.

1345
01:34:36,490 --> 01:34:40,610
I'm at a place where there is a beautiful 
tea estate and my most beautiful Varsha.

1346
01:34:42,150 --> 01:34:43,250
Did you come to Ooty?

1347
01:34:43,650 --> 01:34:45,200
Yeah, surprise.

1348
01:34:46,380 --> 01:34:48,160
I really missed you. 
I wanted to see you.

1349
01:34:48,950 --> 01:34:49,570
Come soon.

1350
01:35:04,210 --> 01:35:04,660
Mahi.

1351
01:35:05,770 --> 01:35:07,930
I am going to take a 
very important decision.

1352
01:35:08,990 --> 01:35:09,620
I have to go.

1353
01:35:19,990 --> 01:35:20,510
Take care.

1354
01:35:27,590 --> 01:35:30,570
[coughs]

1355
01:35:31,350 --> 01:35:32,630
-Are you okay? 
-Yeah!

1356
01:36:37,200 --> 01:36:40,400
[coughs]

1357
01:36:50,570 --> 01:36:51,840
It's been so long since I saw you, Varsha.

1358
01:36:52,710 --> 01:36:53,520
I missed you so much.

1359
01:36:54,780 --> 01:36:56,740
I can't stay away from you anymore.

1360
01:36:57,700 --> 01:36:58,990
Anyways, you have attained your goal.

1361
01:37:00,240 --> 01:37:02,260
It makes no sense to 
waste any more time.

1362
01:37:02,950 --> 01:37:05,040
Rahul, I have to tell you something.

1363
01:37:05,200 --> 01:37:05,750
One minute.

1364
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:14,910
Will you marry me?

1365
01:37:16,860 --> 01:37:17,550
I am talking to you.

1366
01:37:18,520 --> 01:37:19,210
Will you marry me?

1367
01:37:20,610 --> 01:37:21,350
Sorry, Rahul.

1368
01:37:22,600 --> 01:37:23,380
I can't marry you.

1369
01:37:25,940 --> 01:37:26,520
Are you joking?

1370
01:37:27,030 --> 01:37:28,930
Uh-uh! 
I'm serious.

1371
01:37:29,480 --> 01:37:30,220
What do you mean by that?

1372
01:37:31,380 --> 01:37:33,840
I am in love with someone else.

1373
01:37:34,700 --> 01:37:35,540
Don't be ridiculous.

1374
01:37:37,030 --> 01:37:37,700
I don't believe you, Varsha.

1375
01:37:38,700 --> 01:37:40,250
I know that you like me.

1376
01:37:40,650 --> 01:37:42,770
It's the truth even if 
you believe it or not.

1377
01:37:43,200 --> 01:37:44,520
Where did I go wrong, Varsha?

1378
01:37:45,470 --> 01:37:46,460
I waited for you.

1379
01:37:46,820 --> 01:37:48,240
I supported you when you were struggling.

1380
01:37:48,860 --> 01:37:51,260
I stood by you even when my 
parents opposed our love.

1381
01:37:51,610 --> 01:37:54,380
When I said I don't have feelings for you, 
I didn't mean that I don't like you.

1382
01:37:55,030 --> 01:37:57,530
I mean I don't have enough feelings 
for you to continue my life's journey.

1383
01:37:59,530 --> 01:38:00,120
Who is he?

1384
01:38:00,780 --> 01:38:01,650
It's not necessary now.

1385
01:38:02,570 --> 01:38:06,260
Give me one good reason for rejecting 
me but not for accepting him.

1386
01:38:06,540 --> 01:38:08,960
We have met a lot of time in these 
three years, isn't it, Rahul?

1387
01:38:09,740 --> 01:38:11,790
Tell me one memory that 
really stands out to you.

1388
01:38:12,640 --> 01:38:15,380
Tell me one memory that made you 
want to cherish it for a lifetime?

1389
01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:20,420
Tell me one memory where you felt 
beautiful to have me around.

1390
01:38:22,240 --> 01:38:23,450
Did he give you that many memories?

1391
01:38:23,490 --> 01:38:24,610
Mind your language, Rahul.

1392
01:38:24,760 --> 01:38:25,410
Never mind me. Tell me.

1393
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:27,000
I can take it.

1394
01:38:28,950 --> 01:38:29,420
That's it...

1395
01:38:30,860 --> 01:38:31,380
That's it.

1396
01:38:32,530 --> 01:38:35,880
Love will not survive in a place where you 
cannot express your likes and dislikes.

1397
01:38:38,030 --> 01:38:39,510
Varsha... I am sorry.

1398
01:38:39,650 --> 01:38:40,760
Varsha... Varsha please...

1399
01:38:42,220 --> 01:38:42,780
I am sorry.

1400
01:38:43,030 --> 01:38:44,220
Give me one more chance.

1401
01:38:44,910 --> 01:38:45,800
-Please. 
-It's too late, Rahul.

1402
01:38:46,650 --> 01:38:47,240
I am sorry.

1403
01:38:52,870 --> 01:38:53,370

1405
01:39:01,800 --> 01:39:03,460
You are in a helpless situation Mahi.

1406
01:39:05,150 --> 01:39:08,090
I have checked all the test reports 
conducted at Hyderabad recently.

1407
01:39:09,420 --> 01:39:13,580
For the past five to six months, your 
condition has taken a turn for the worse.

[phone ringing]

1409
01:39:15,830 --> 01:39:16,290
It's okay.

1410
01:39:16,710 --> 01:39:17,610
Attend the call if it's urgent.

1411
01:39:17,880 --> 01:39:18,590
No, doctor.

1412
01:39:22,950 --> 01:39:25,790
From the past week, you have slipped into 
a very dangerous condition.

1413
01:39:29,490 --> 01:39:31,120
We have to start your 
treatment immediately.

1414
01:39:33,610 --> 01:39:35,080
I need some time, doctor.

1415
01:39:35,760 --> 01:39:36,760
If you delay it further...

1416
01:39:37,860 --> 01:39:38,470
I am sorry.

1417
01:39:46,820 --> 01:39:47,380
Hello.

1418
01:39:48,050 --> 01:39:48,740
Did you start?

1419
01:39:49,570 --> 01:39:50,200
No, not yet.

1420
01:39:50,560 --> 01:39:52,570
Geeta, Mahi isn't answering my phone.

1421
01:39:52,900 --> 01:39:55,700
I can't imagine watching 
the premiere show without him.

1422
01:39:56,150 --> 01:39:58,150
He must be busy. 
He will call you back.

1423
01:39:58,400 --> 01:40:00,640
No, find out his address.

1424
01:40:00,930 --> 01:40:02,620
Let's meet up, go to him and 
remind him about the premier show.

1425
01:40:03,030 --> 01:40:04,760
-I will see you there. Okay, bye. 
-Bye.

1426
01:40:05,660 --> 01:40:08,970
Mother, I will pick up Geeta and 
come directly to the airport.

1427
01:40:09,070 --> 01:40:11,250
-You come there directly. Okay? 
-Don't worry. She will come.

1428
01:40:11,740 --> 01:40:13,810
Let it be, sister. She said she will 
come with her friend, didn't she?

1429
01:40:14,010 --> 01:40:16,090
You always agree with what she says.

1430
01:40:16,190 --> 01:40:17,060
Come back on time, dear.

1431
01:40:17,170 --> 01:40:18,810
We will miss the premier show 
if we miss the flight.

1432
01:40:19,280 --> 01:40:21,310
-Thank you, uncle. 
-Bye, mother. Bye.

1433
01:40:21,400 --> 01:40:21,980
-Bye. 
-Come soon.

1434
01:40:25,950 --> 01:40:27,490
This is the address 
given by Mahi's friend.

1435
01:40:27,700 --> 01:40:28,830
-Just go and come back soon. 
-Hmm.

1436
01:40:29,050 --> 01:40:30,290
-Don't be late. 
-Okay.

[door bell ringing]

1438
01:40:37,030 --> 01:40:38,490
-Hi, Aunty. 
-Who are you?

1439
01:40:38,840 --> 01:40:41,310
Aunty, my name is Varsha. 
I am Mahi's friend.

1440
01:40:41,820 --> 01:40:43,120
-Come inside. 
-Thanks, Aunty.

1441
01:40:47,360 --> 01:40:48,620
Aunty, isn't Mahi around?

1442
01:40:49,200 --> 01:40:50,910
Mahi has gone to his 
father's photo studio.

1443
01:40:51,040 --> 01:40:53,860
I have been waiting for him as well. 
He isn't picking up his calls.

1444
01:40:54,070 --> 01:40:54,810
Just take a seat.

1445
01:40:54,890 --> 01:40:56,140
-I will get you some water. 
-Okay, Aunty.

1446
01:41:36,700 --> 01:41:37,390
Here.

1447
01:41:37,860 --> 01:41:39,420
Aunty, that photo...

1448
01:41:39,580 --> 01:41:42,320
That was the first photo of Mahi, 
taken by his father.

1449
01:41:42,630 --> 01:41:43,610
Who is the other one in that photo?

1450
01:41:43,990 --> 01:41:46,870
That girl and Mahi were born 
at the same time in the hospital.

1451
01:41:47,650 --> 01:41:48,790
Do you know them?

1452
01:41:49,400 --> 01:41:50,100
No, I don't know.

1453
01:41:50,940 --> 01:41:52,960
Aunty, the girl in that photo is me.

1454
01:41:54,170 --> 01:41:54,980
Aren't you believing it, Aunty?

1455
01:41:55,240 --> 01:41:56,960
Uncle was the one that caused 
the accident to our car, right?

1456
01:41:57,240 --> 01:41:57,660
Hmm.

1457
01:41:57,860 --> 01:41:59,630
And that is when my mother went 
into labour, didn't she?

1458
01:42:00,530 --> 01:42:02,040
Hmm, yeah!

1459
01:42:02,700 --> 01:42:04,760
So, are you that girl?

1460
01:42:09,570 --> 01:42:11,560
I will immediately call 
Mahi and tell this to him.

1461
01:42:11,660 --> 01:42:13,640
Please, Aunty... 
I will tell to Mahi.

1462
01:42:13,840 --> 01:42:16,460
I will surprise him. 
Please Aunty, don't tell him.

1463
01:42:17,610 --> 01:42:19,080
-Alright. 
-Promise me.

1464
01:42:19,360 --> 01:42:20,210
I won't tell.

1465
01:42:24,180 --> 01:42:25,600
Geetha, I am so happy.

something important. Open the door.

Where might have he gone?

1485
01:43:32,200 --> 01:43:33,710
He must be in the middle 
of something important.

1486

-He will call you later. 
-It's not that. Please wait for some time.

didn't he?

I don't know what to do.

How do I break this news to her?

1493
01:43:50,770 --> 01:43:53,410
Can she bear the fact 
that I'm going to die?

1494
01:43:56,990 --> 01:43:59,080

entering into her life.

Nothing will happen to you.

Come to Hyderabad immediately. Let's get 
you admitted into a very good hospital.

I am not confident that I would come 
out alive if I admit into a hospital.

even after knowing your condition?

even at this time?

01:46:52,100 --> 01:46:55,010
Hey! Just do what I ask you to. 
Just go directly to the hospital.

1530
01:46:55,270 --> 01:46:56,510
I will tell her the truth.

1531
01:46:56,610 --> 01:47:00,060
In love, 
hiding the truth is as similar to lying.

1532
01:47:01,440 --> 01:47:04,100
She shouldn't mistake 
my love for her as a lie.

1533
01:47:04,980 --> 01:47:06,920
If I go to the hospital, 
I don't know if I will ever see her again.

1534
01:47:07,650 --> 01:47:08,590
I will go and meet her once.

1535
01:47:09,850 --> 01:47:10,940
Mahi, she doesn't mind all that...

1536
01:47:11,130 --> 01:47:12,480
Hello... Hello...

01:47:19,760 --> 01:47:25,660

1539
01:48:05,790 --> 01:48:07,610
You are important in my life.

1540
01:48:08,740 --> 01:48:10,310
But I'll be happy if you are beside me.

1541
01:48:10,820 --> 01:48:11,660
Where are you?

1542
01:48:11,990 --> 01:48:15,830
I'm searching for you though 
they are looking at me.

1543
01:48:16,720 --> 01:48:21,020
You should see the happiness in my eyes 
while everyone is appreciating me.

1544
01:48:21,360 --> 01:48:22,750
Please, come.

1545

1546
01:48:26,120 --> 01:48:27,050
No, Rajesh.

1547
01:48:27,620 --> 01:48:31,540
You need a person to love 
and while I need a soul.

1548
01:48:32,270 --> 01:48:35,780
You need marriage to stay 
together while I want love.

1549
01:48:36,370 --> 01:48:41,630
Life doesn't meant to earn money 
but to gather memories.

1550
01:48:42,240 --> 01:48:46,890
Is it fair to stay with you while 
I have my memories with him?

1551
01:48:48,110 --> 01:48:51,570
Or do you want me to get marry 
to a boy of my parent's choice?

1552
01:48:52,290 --> 01:48:55,320
Then I'll give my life 
to you and my love to him.

1553
01:48:56,440 --> 01:48:58,570
Rajesh, it seems like a old saying.

1554
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:00,040
Though I'm saying it.

1555
01:49:00,820 --> 01:49:02,960
My life and death are with him.

1556
01:49:04,080 --> 01:49:05,090
My heart belongs to him.

1557
01:49:05,940 --> 01:49:09,360
There is no change in this decision 
and no one can change it.

1558
01:49:11,650 --> 01:49:14,650
We both know why you came.

1559
01:49:14,850 --> 01:49:17,350

Can you hear me?

Hello mister!

Hey, come here.

1570
01:50:20,230 --> 01:50:20,660
Hold him.

1571
01:50:26,060 --> 01:50:26,630
Careful.

1572
01:50:30,060 --> 01:50:30,560
Drive fast.

1573
01:50:38,690 --> 01:50:39,140
Hello.

1574
01:50:39,400 --> 01:50:39,800
Hello, Mahi.

1575
01:50:40,570 --> 01:50:42,770
Mahi is unconscious here. 
He is not in a position to speak.

1576
01:50:42,850 --> 01:50:45,510
Oh, my God! He is a heart patient. 
Bring him to Nova hospital immediately.

1577
01:50:46,190 --> 01:50:47,440
Driver, drive to Nova hospital.

Mother, give me the phone.

1580
01:50:56,650 --> 01:50:58,650
-Did Mahi call you? 
-No, he didn't.

1581
01:50:58,850 --> 01:51:00,310
I need to speak to him urgently. 
Call him.

1582
01:51:00,450 --> 01:51:00,950
Okay.

1583
01:51:07,270 --> 01:51:08,480

Rahul, how is it that you are here?

1593
01:52:00,600 --> 01:52:01,250
Where is Mahi?

1594
01:52:02,270 --> 01:52:04,530
Mahi fainted in front of 
the premiere theatre.

1595

His condition is critical. 
I am taking him to the Nova Hospital.

-Don't worry. 
-What happened to my daughter?

-Did the doctors say anything? 
-Nurse.

Madam, the patient is inside 
and is undergoing treatment.

Doctor will come and talk to you.

-Please, don't worry.

Heart transplantation is the 
only option left to save him.

We are trying our best to 
find him a suitable heart.

But she isn't responding to the tests.
