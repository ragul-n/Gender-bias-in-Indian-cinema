1
00:02:09,075 --> 00:02:14,240
'Well, in this world there
are two kinds of ghosts.'

2
00:02:14,381 --> 00:02:15,780
'Two kinds.'

3
00:02:16,316 --> 00:02:21,049
'The ones who stay back
because of an unfulfilled desire.'

4
00:02:21,121 --> 00:02:27,117
'They are stuck in this world
till their desire isn't fulfilled.'

5
00:02:27,561 --> 00:02:29,028
'Like him.'

6
00:02:29,095 --> 00:02:30,187
'Why are you still stuck here, sir?'

7
00:02:30,464 --> 00:02:34,161
Till Sweetie doesn't
offer a wreath to my grave..

8
00:02:34,768 --> 00:02:37,362
This Lobo's ghost
isn't going anywhere.

9
00:02:38,338 --> 00:02:39,100
No.

10
00:02:39,206 --> 00:02:40,195
'l think he has become
a tad too emotional.'

11
00:02:40,407 --> 00:02:42,170
Go..
- 'Okay, okay.. Okay.'

12
00:02:42,476 --> 00:02:44,740
'And what about you, ma'am?'

13
00:02:45,345 --> 00:02:48,473
He took the ulcer out of my stomach
but forgot his mobile inside.

14
00:02:48,648 --> 00:02:52,414
Let him die,
l'll thrash him and escort him up.

15
00:02:53,053 --> 00:02:53,815
'And you?'

16
00:02:54,087 --> 00:02:58,615
l just want to know
who left this manhole open.

17
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:00,118
Same

18
00:03:00,193 --> 00:03:01,421
'Okay.'

19
00:03:01,595 --> 00:03:03,085
'All the best.'

20
00:03:03,363 --> 00:03:05,729
'And then there are
those who are like me.'

21
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,465
'Who, aftertheir
desire is fulfilled..'

22
00:03:08,535 --> 00:03:10,799
'Declare their innings
and return to the pavilion.'

23
00:03:11,738 --> 00:03:14,104
'And this pavilion is called..'

24
00:03:14,274 --> 00:03:15,536
'The Ghost World.'

25
00:03:25,252 --> 00:03:30,315
This Ghost World isn't
like you think it is.'

26
00:03:31,258 --> 00:03:33,852
'lt's like an exotic resort.'

27
00:03:33,894 --> 00:03:35,327
'That's all.'

28
00:03:38,532 --> 00:03:41,990
'Ghosts chill out over here.'

29
00:03:42,068 --> 00:03:44,195
'Spend theirtime as they please.'

30
00:03:44,938 --> 00:03:48,305
'Enjoy their ghostly powers.'

31
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:52,378
'Chitchat.'

32
00:03:52,445 --> 00:03:55,243
That's Mrs. Rastogi.

33
00:03:55,415 --> 00:03:57,542
She too is dead!

34
00:03:57,884 --> 00:03:59,511
She died because of malaria.

35
00:03:59,586 --> 00:04:01,144
How cheap.

36
00:04:01,288 --> 00:04:03,279
Ladies, l tell you.

37
00:04:05,425 --> 00:04:09,452
'And they wait fortheir next life.'

38
00:04:11,898 --> 00:04:15,265
'This grand building
that you see before you..'

39
00:04:15,402 --> 00:04:17,996
'This is the main office.'

40
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:21,266
'The Main office.'

41
00:04:49,569 --> 00:04:51,093
Wow!

42
00:04:52,706 --> 00:04:57,040
Surely the building is amazing.

43
00:05:01,815 --> 00:05:06,514
But the work in here is just
like a government office.

44
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,612
Yes.

45
00:05:15,695 --> 00:05:20,098
So, don't keep your
expectations too high.

46
00:05:21,201 --> 00:05:22,293
Yes.

47
00:05:29,109 --> 00:05:30,098
Brother..

48
00:05:30,443 --> 00:05:32,104
No, brother..

49
00:05:32,212 --> 00:05:35,340
Brother you were born in lndia..

50
00:05:35,482 --> 00:05:37,382
But you died as an NRl, right?

51
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:38,417
ln Canada.

52
00:05:38,485 --> 00:05:40,476
So try the Canada department.

53
00:05:40,687 --> 00:05:42,678
Okay? Okay bye.

54
00:05:43,757 --> 00:05:45,088
Yes?

55
00:05:45,825 --> 00:05:46,849
So?

56
00:05:47,127 --> 00:05:48,788
They got married yesterday, right?

57
00:05:49,162 --> 00:05:51,153
Let Mrs. Apte get pregnant at least.

58
00:05:51,264 --> 00:05:52,288
Then we'll send you.

59
00:05:52,365 --> 00:05:53,798
Okay? okay.

60
00:05:55,869 --> 00:05:57,166
Name?

61
00:05:58,271 --> 00:05:59,670
Kailash Nath.

62
00:05:59,739 --> 00:06:01,263
Kailash Nath!

63
00:06:13,253 --> 00:06:16,120
Oh! So you are
Bhoothnath (Ghost Nath).

64
00:06:16,222 --> 00:06:17,189
Yes.

65
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,322
Bhoothnath (Ghost Nath).

66
00:06:25,298 --> 00:06:27,232
Good. Good.

67
00:06:28,401 --> 00:06:30,426
How long will l have to wait
for my next life?

68
00:06:30,503 --> 00:06:33,131
That depends on what you wish to be.

69
00:06:33,406 --> 00:06:35,397
A mosquito, a fly, an ant, a flea.

70
00:06:35,475 --> 00:06:36,533
Ready delivery.

71
00:06:36,643 --> 00:06:38,406
Dog, cat, goat, pig..

72
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:40,378
lf you wish to be any of
these, then that'll take a week.

73
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:44,539
And to be an actor's dog you'll
have to give a written application.

74
00:06:44,684 --> 00:06:46,379
That's beyond our powers.

75
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:49,317
lt's decided by that lucky draw.

76
00:06:52,659 --> 00:06:55,184
l want to be a human.

77
00:06:55,261 --> 00:06:56,626
Then take this token.

78
00:07:00,033 --> 00:07:01,364
And wait.

79
00:07:03,403 --> 00:07:06,201
Ten crore one thousand twenty-nine.

80
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,632
How long do l have to wait?

81
00:07:08,775 --> 00:07:12,142
''Token number 13,482.''

82
00:07:12,312 --> 00:07:13,677
lt's a long wait.

83
00:07:13,747 --> 00:07:18,184
When yourturn comes,
meet the senior officer.

84
00:07:21,521 --> 00:07:22,545
Next!

85
00:07:23,757 --> 00:07:25,247
Thank you sir.

86
00:08:18,144 --> 00:08:19,304
What?

87
00:08:22,949 --> 00:08:25,110
Everyone's laughing at me.
What's going on?

88
00:08:25,652 --> 00:08:28,018
How do you expect them not to.

89
00:08:28,087 --> 00:08:28,678
Why?

90
00:08:28,955 --> 00:08:31,014
You've made a mockery out of ghosts.

91
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:33,422
Mockery out of ghosts?
- Yes.

92
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,120
How so?

93
00:08:35,195 --> 00:08:38,062
You couldn't scare
a kid on earth.

94
00:08:38,131 --> 00:08:39,962
What was his name?

95
00:08:40,033 --> 00:08:42,126
Aah...Banku!

96
00:08:46,072 --> 00:08:47,562
''Mr. Banku''

97
00:08:47,707 --> 00:08:51,143
''Mr. Banku, never gets scared,
Mr. Banku''

98
00:08:55,081 --> 00:08:56,605
Got it?

99
00:09:04,991 --> 00:09:07,391
Mr. Bhoothnath, where do you think
you are going? Excuse me!

100
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,525
lt's not yourturn.

101
00:09:09,596 --> 00:09:11,154
You cannot go upstairs.

102
00:09:11,231 --> 00:09:13,665
l'll cancel yourtoken Bhoothnath.

103
00:09:14,367 --> 00:09:16,733
Excuse me, sir.
- Sir. Sir. He has come out of turn.

104
00:09:17,003 --> 00:09:17,992
Shh..

105
00:09:18,738 --> 00:09:20,000
Sir..

106
00:09:20,573 --> 00:09:22,268
Sir, for how long will this go on?

107
00:09:22,508 --> 00:09:23,600
For how long what will go on?

108
00:09:23,676 --> 00:09:25,541
Sir, everyone is laughing at me.

109
00:09:27,213 --> 00:09:28,612
You only gave them the chance.

110
00:09:28,681 --> 00:09:32,173
Sir, that kid could see me.
How's that my fault?

111
00:09:32,285 --> 00:09:34,515
Umm..That's ourtechnical fault.

112
00:09:34,587 --> 00:09:38,421
Because of which some people
can see ghosts and some can't.

113
00:09:38,591 --> 00:09:40,149
We're working on it.

114
00:09:40,526 --> 00:09:43,154
But you should've scared him.

115
00:09:45,231 --> 00:09:47,028
Sir, what has happened has happened.

116
00:09:47,133 --> 00:09:49,431
Then what's happening,
let that happen too.

117
00:09:49,636 --> 00:09:52,537
Sir please do something
it's getting very embarrassing.

118
00:09:54,774 --> 00:09:55,741
Please, sir.

119
00:09:56,042 --> 00:09:58,476
Please. Please. Please.

120
00:09:58,711 --> 00:09:59,769
Fine.

121
00:10:00,046 --> 00:10:02,480
Let's do one thing.
Let's send you back to earth.

122
00:10:02,548 --> 00:10:06,678
Go there and scare a
few kids and clear your name.

123
00:10:07,053 --> 00:10:09,521
But sir, my number..

124
00:10:09,656 --> 00:10:11,180
it's going take a long time.

125
00:10:11,257 --> 00:10:13,657
Not as a human being.

126
00:10:14,093 --> 00:10:15,458
But as a...ghost.

127
00:10:19,265 --> 00:10:20,391
Can you do that?

128
00:10:20,466 --> 00:10:22,764
l can do anything.

129
00:10:23,002 --> 00:10:24,264
But you need to think...

130
00:10:24,337 --> 00:10:26,464
Or else, instead of winning respect

131
00:10:26,773 --> 00:10:29,401
You might end up losing
even your self-respect.

132
00:10:32,478 --> 00:10:35,003
Well in that case sir...
You can laugh all you want.

133
00:10:35,081 --> 00:10:36,981
Okay, as you please.

134
00:10:44,457 --> 00:10:46,015
What have you done, sir.

135
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:50,293
Look...there are three things really
missing in our Ghost World.

136
00:10:50,496 --> 00:10:53,488
Entertainment.
Entertainment. Entertainment.

137
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,194
And he is entertainment?

138
00:10:58,404 --> 00:11:04,365
'Forthe first time, a ghost was
returning back to earth as a ghost.'

139
00:11:05,545 --> 00:11:08,343
'What was l supposed to do,
my honourwas at stake.'

140
00:11:20,293 --> 00:11:22,591
'But then, another question arose.'

141
00:11:22,862 --> 00:11:27,026
'Which kid should l scare?'

142
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,125
Uncle, give me a burger.

143
00:11:29,869 --> 00:11:31,530
'Alas l found my target.'

144
00:11:32,505 --> 00:11:34,268
Aye...get lost from here.

145
00:11:34,374 --> 00:11:35,602
How dare you..

146
00:11:36,209 --> 00:11:38,234
One whack on your head
and you'll become a ghost.

147
00:11:38,311 --> 00:11:40,006
What are you doing?

148
00:11:40,213 --> 00:11:42,340
Can't you see his fault..
Do you want one too?

149
00:11:42,415 --> 00:11:44,178
'This kid seems too dangerous.'

150
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:49,511
These ghosts are so funny.

151
00:11:50,923 --> 00:11:52,117
True.

152
00:11:56,195 --> 00:11:58,026
Any passing by spirit, please come.

153
00:11:58,097 --> 00:11:59,928
Any passing by spirit, please come.

154
00:11:59,999 --> 00:12:01,899
Any passing by spirit, please come.

155
00:12:01,968 --> 00:12:03,128
Just a minute.

156
00:12:03,336 --> 00:12:04,894
Why are we calling a ghost?

157
00:12:04,937 --> 00:12:08,134
First we'll bully him
then we'll make him do our homework.

158
00:12:08,307 --> 00:12:12,175
Get going, Bhoothnath!
Better scram off.

159
00:12:14,113 --> 00:12:18,209
Everyone seems like a saint
while taking the token.

160
00:12:19,452 --> 00:12:22,649
By the time they become children
they become complete devils.

161
00:12:23,089 --> 00:12:24,579
Come on, let's go home.

162
00:12:24,657 --> 00:12:26,318
What happened?
- What happened?

163
00:12:26,392 --> 00:12:28,622
Don't you know who stays here?

164
00:12:28,895 --> 00:12:32,160
What's the big deal...
why are you guys getting scared?

165
00:12:32,231 --> 00:12:34,199
A ghost lives here.

166
00:12:34,267 --> 00:12:37,031
We shouldn't play here. My mom
says ghosts come here after dark.

167
00:12:37,103 --> 00:12:39,594
There is no such thing as ghosts.

168
00:12:39,672 --> 00:12:42,505
l too, used to think
so before l died.

169
00:12:42,575 --> 00:12:45,237
Ghosts are real, my boy.

170
00:12:45,411 --> 00:12:48,539
And they can be very scary.

171
00:12:51,217 --> 00:12:53,481
Bwha-ha-ha-ha...

172
00:12:54,954 --> 00:12:56,114
Who laughed?

173
00:12:56,189 --> 00:12:57,520
Must be some drunkard.

174
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:59,385
Bwha-ha-ha-ha...

175
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:01,188
Come before us if you have the guts.

176
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,659
l am a ghost!

177
00:13:06,132 --> 00:13:09,101
Get scared...l am a ghost!

178
00:13:10,603 --> 00:13:11,661
He won't listen like this.

179
00:13:11,938 --> 00:13:13,098
Remove our victory's stuff out.

180
00:13:13,172 --> 00:13:14,434
Yes, boss.

181
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,513
Oh no Ayeee.. Ohhh...

182
00:13:24,383 --> 00:13:25,645
Oh God!

183
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:32,053

These are eyes, not buttons.

Why are you touching your hair?

196
00:14:07,093 --> 00:14:08,492

00:23:15,474 --> 00:23:17,203
Have you lost your mind?

360
00:23:17,576 --> 00:23:19,373
She'll get scared if
you introduce herto a ghost.

361
00:23:19,511 --> 00:23:21,638
l don't hide anything
from my mother.

362
00:23:22,081 --> 00:23:23,981
Anyways, she only fears God.

363
00:23:24,049 --> 00:23:25,311
Come on.
- lt'll be a problem.

364
00:23:25,384 --> 00:23:26,715
Come on!

365
00:23:27,052 --> 00:23:29,043
He's bound to get thrashed.

366
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:39,720
Why are you standing
there like a ghost?

367
00:23:40,499 --> 00:23:42,228
l want to introduce you to someone.

368
00:23:42,434 --> 00:23:43,958
Then ask him to come inside.

369
00:23:44,036 --> 00:23:45,503
He is here.

370
00:23:48,207 --> 00:23:50,038
You've caught a
snake or a frog again?

371
00:23:50,309 --> 00:23:52,300
Oh yes, you cannot see him.

372
00:23:52,377 --> 00:23:54,675
Why?
- Because he's a ghost.

373
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,214
He. Here.

374
00:23:57,382 --> 00:23:59,577
Damn, did you try drugs?

375
00:23:59,651 --> 00:24:00,743
Show me your eyes!

376
00:24:00,986 --> 00:24:02,283
Open your mouth!

377
00:24:02,721 --> 00:24:04,416
l told you, you'll get thrashed.

378
00:24:05,991 --> 00:24:07,515
Akhrot is telling the truth.

379
00:24:07,626 --> 00:24:09,389
l really am a ghost.

380
00:24:11,196 --> 00:24:13,664
''Oh Hanuman, the ocean of knowledge
and virtues, may you be victorious.''

381
00:24:14,199 --> 00:24:15,496
Come on, man.
- l had told you..

382
00:24:15,567 --> 00:24:17,535
..not to pee close to that
sacred tree in the evening.

383
00:24:17,603 --> 00:24:19,127
See now... a ghost is after you.

384
00:24:19,338 --> 00:24:22,034
''You are the trusted
messenger of Rama.''

385
00:24:22,141 --> 00:24:24,166
But he is a very nice ghost.
- Shut up.

386
00:24:25,177 --> 00:24:29,443
''You are known as son of
Anjana and son of the Wind God.''

387
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:32,514
Has he left?

388
00:24:32,584 --> 00:24:35,280
You had said that
she fears only God.

389
00:24:40,025 --> 00:24:43,290
Look Mr. Ghost,
he is a fatherless child.

390
00:24:44,563 --> 00:24:46,793
He has made a mistake.
Please forgive him.

391
00:24:47,466 --> 00:24:49,229
We are very poor.

392
00:24:49,701 --> 00:24:51,760
We have nothing to give you.

393
00:24:52,571 --> 00:24:54,129
Please leave.

394
00:24:59,778 --> 00:25:00,710
He's gone.

395
00:25:01,146 --> 00:25:02,443
He's gone?

396
00:25:03,882 --> 00:25:06,510
Don't utter a word. Stay quiet.

397
00:25:06,819 --> 00:25:07,843
Swear by me.

398
00:25:08,287 --> 00:25:10,653
Swear by me that you
won't meet that ghost again.

399
00:25:10,722 --> 00:25:12,121
But he is a very nice ghost.

400
00:25:12,191 --> 00:25:13,681
Swear by me.

401
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:19,320
l swear.

402
00:25:25,137 --> 00:25:26,729
Tell me something.
- Yes?

403
00:25:26,805 --> 00:25:31,333
Up there, have you met anyone who
died because someone broke a promise?

404
00:25:32,678 --> 00:25:34,168
No, l haven't.

405
00:25:35,514 --> 00:25:36,913
Then it's fine.

406
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:40,717
Don't mind my mother,
she has seen very bad days.

407
00:25:42,287 --> 00:25:44,152
Can l help you in any way?

408
00:25:44,323 --> 00:25:45,290
Why?

409
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:47,219
Because l want to help you.

410
00:25:47,292 --> 00:25:48,350
How can you help me?

411
00:25:48,427 --> 00:25:51,419
l will take some money from
a rich guy and give it to you.

412
00:25:51,496 --> 00:25:55,432
He won't even realize that he suffered
a loss and you'll benefit a little.

413
00:25:56,902 --> 00:26:00,269
lf l had to lead a thief's
life then l could have.

414
00:26:05,577 --> 00:26:06,737
Like this.

415
00:26:06,812 --> 00:26:07,779
Hey..

416
00:26:13,185 --> 00:26:14,243
But no.

417
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:20,387
l don't want to live such a life.

418
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:22,390
What kind of a man are you?
You picked his pocket.

419
00:26:22,527 --> 00:26:24,518
Why are you unnecessarily
raising your blood pressure?

420
00:26:24,696 --> 00:26:26,254
Anyways, you are a ghost.

421
00:26:26,331 --> 00:26:29,767
And a ghost's job is to
cause problems, not solve them.

422
00:26:30,869 --> 00:26:31,927
What do you mean?

423
00:26:32,471 --> 00:26:33,460
l mean..

424
00:26:33,538 --> 00:26:35,267
..take Rawat's building for example.
- Okay.

425
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:36,398
Naseeb Heights.
- Okay.

426
00:26:36,475 --> 00:26:39,273
There's no building as
unfortunate as that one in Mumbai.

427
00:26:39,544 --> 00:26:40,977
lts construction has been
stalled since the past 11/2 years.

428
00:26:41,213 --> 00:26:41,941
Why?

429
00:26:42,214 --> 00:26:44,808
There's a spirit like you
residing overthere. A ghost.

430
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:46,749
Anyone who goes in,
comes out injured.

431
00:26:46,818 --> 00:26:48,718
He throws bricks
and stones at everyone.

432
00:26:56,428 --> 00:26:58,862
You want to make an honest living?
- Yes.

433
00:26:58,931 --> 00:27:00,296
Come.

434
00:27:00,732 --> 00:27:02,597
Where?
- Come on.

435
00:27:07,272 --> 00:27:08,534
Here we less likely to get work..

436
00:27:08,607 --> 00:27:10,268
..more likely to get whacks.

437
00:27:11,276 --> 00:27:12,436
Do you have ten bucks?

438
00:27:12,511 --> 00:27:14,945
He won't agree with that.
- He will. He will.

439
00:27:15,247 --> 00:27:18,307
One cannot even buy half
a cup of tea and bread-butter.

440
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:22,011
Since you have gone up,
prices have gone up too.

441
00:27:22,788 --> 00:27:26,246
But man's greed
is still the same.

442
00:27:26,425 --> 00:27:27,517
Give.

443
00:27:49,982 --> 00:27:51,916
Can l come in, sir?

444
00:27:52,951 --> 00:27:55,818
Who allowed you to come in?

445
00:27:55,954 --> 00:27:58,286
Your Naseeb, sir.
- What?

446
00:28:00,292 --> 00:28:03,750
lf you can spare two minutes
then l can save you millions.

447
00:28:04,529 --> 00:28:05,655
ls it?

448
00:28:15,941 --> 00:28:19,069
Oh damn!
Afreaking dangerous building!

449
00:28:20,912 --> 00:28:22,379
''Oh Lord, save me from all evil!''

450
00:28:22,447 --> 00:28:24,813
''Oh Lord, save me from all evil!''

451
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:29,946
Hey.. that day you were saying 'poor
fears no one'. Now what happened ?

452
00:28:30,455 --> 00:28:32,753
l just made that up
to come across as smart.

453
00:28:34,092 --> 00:28:35,821
You got scared! You got scared!

454
00:28:35,927 --> 00:28:37,360
Damn you!

455
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:40,621
Will you really be able
to make the ghost go away?

456
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:44,598
Come on, man.
Have some confidence in me.

457
00:28:44,703 --> 00:28:46,796
l have confidence.

458
00:28:46,872 --> 00:28:49,966
l was just checking if
l am the only one who has it.

459
00:29:10,162 --> 00:29:11,629
Oh damn!

460
00:29:11,997 --> 00:29:13,191
Excuse me, mister.

461
00:29:13,665 --> 00:29:15,599
Please listen to me.

462
00:29:16,334 --> 00:29:17,562
Go away from here.

463
00:29:22,307 --> 00:29:23,501
What do you want?

464
00:29:23,942 --> 00:29:26,206
l want to help you and this kid

465
00:29:27,112 --> 00:29:29,273
lf you leave you
will get salvation..

466
00:29:29,981 --> 00:29:33,644
..and this kid will make some money.

467
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:40,157
Why should l leave?

468
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,618
l was the engineer of this building.

469
00:29:44,663 --> 00:29:48,121
l died getting crushed under a slab
but it made no difference to anyone.

470
00:29:51,002 --> 00:29:52,970
And those life insurance guys..

471
00:29:53,238 --> 00:29:55,433
.. bloody bribe seekers.

472
00:29:55,941 --> 00:29:59,570
They still haven't
given my family the money.

473
00:30:02,247 --> 00:30:05,182
Go and see in what condition
my wife and child are in.

474
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:07,418
They can't even manage
one square meal a day.

475
00:30:07,486 --> 00:30:09,511
And you are concerned
about his money!

476
00:30:14,993 --> 00:30:17,985
What if l get them
what is rightfully theirs?

477
00:30:19,197 --> 00:30:20,164
Then..

478
00:30:20,432 --> 00:30:23,299
..then why will l stay here.

479
00:30:28,273 --> 00:30:29,501
Fine.

480
00:30:31,143 --> 00:30:32,474
Let me try.

481
00:30:33,478 --> 00:30:34,570
But..

482
00:30:35,547 --> 00:30:37,606
..why haven't you done anything?

483
00:30:40,051 --> 00:30:42,645
What can a person
do after he is dead?

484
00:30:46,191 --> 00:30:48,625
l thought the same before l died.

485
00:30:52,397 --> 00:30:53,659
lt's simple.

486
00:30:54,032 --> 00:30:56,592
Bribe the officer
and get the work done.

487
00:30:56,668 --> 00:30:57,999
Hey..

488
00:30:59,104 --> 00:31:03,632
..bribing the officerwill only
help this engineer get his money.

489
00:31:04,209 --> 00:31:08,145
Nothing will happen to all those
cheques still stuck in his file.

490
00:31:09,147 --> 00:31:10,307
l didn't get you.

491
00:31:10,382 --> 00:31:11,474
Look..

492
00:31:13,351 --> 00:31:18,653
..a person does a bad deed
because he doesn't fearthe good

493
00:31:19,224 --> 00:31:21,658
This is very important.
Listen to me very carefully.

494
00:31:22,394 --> 00:31:27,024
The day the evil in him
starts fearing the good..

495
00:31:27,199 --> 00:31:31,533
..he will think twice before
doing a bad deed.

496
00:31:34,072 --> 00:31:36,336
Don't you think l am a bit
too small to say all this?

497
00:31:36,408 --> 00:31:40,344
No, you go and stand at the crease.
l'll do the batting.

498
00:31:41,112 --> 00:31:42,545
Let's go.

499
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:46,710
And what do you want?

500
00:31:46,785 --> 00:31:49,652
Sir, Mr. Shrivastav's file is stuck.

501
00:31:51,122 --> 00:31:52,487
What's wrong with your voice?

502
00:31:52,624 --> 00:31:58,119
Well, sir, my words are powerful,
hence my voice is also powerful.

503
00:31:58,196 --> 00:32:00,164
Oh really, which file?

504
00:32:00,298 --> 00:32:03,665
Nikhil Shrivastav's
insurance claim file.

505
00:32:04,102 --> 00:32:05,797
Son, such jobs take
time to complete.

506
00:32:06,071 --> 00:32:07,095
Got it?

507
00:32:07,172 --> 00:32:09,197
lt's been 11/2 years.

508
00:32:09,374 --> 00:32:11,535
How much more time do you need?

509
00:32:11,676 --> 00:32:15,373
Another 150 years, what will you do?

510
00:32:15,513 --> 00:32:17,606
Fearthe good, sir.

511
00:32:17,816 --> 00:32:21,513
You won't be able to sleep
in peace if you do such things.

512
00:32:23,188 --> 00:32:25,656
l've been sleeping in
peace since the past 20 years.

513
00:32:26,124 --> 00:32:28,319
At home as well as here.

514
00:32:29,461 --> 00:32:30,758
Are you done?

515
00:32:31,563 --> 00:32:33,428
Get going now.

516
00:32:46,177 --> 00:32:47,838
What are you doing?

517
00:34:00,485 --> 00:34:03,079
lt's been two days
and nothing has happened.

518
00:34:03,621 --> 00:34:07,057
He is a government officer
He takes time in doing everything.

519
00:34:07,392 --> 00:34:09,417
He is bound to take
some time to mend his ways.

520
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:13,324
Look, there he comes.

521
00:34:14,899 --> 00:34:16,867
Look at his condition.

522
00:34:17,535 --> 00:34:19,230
Mr. Shrivastav's cheque.

523
00:34:21,072 --> 00:34:22,937
ls this the full amount or
have you taken a cut?

524
00:34:23,241 --> 00:34:24,333
The full amount.

525
00:34:24,476 --> 00:34:26,034
Okay. Good night.

526
00:34:26,144 --> 00:34:27,475
Good night.

527
00:34:44,129 --> 00:34:45,426
Thanks.

528
00:34:46,331 --> 00:34:47,525
Welcome.

529
00:34:50,168 --> 00:34:51,658
You'll be going
to Ghost World, right?

530
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:53,437
Yes.

531
00:34:54,205 --> 00:34:56,298
Don't have high expectations.

532
00:34:59,577 --> 00:35:03,274
Here you go. Take it.

533
00:35:04,082 --> 00:35:05,344
Thanks.

534
00:35:05,517 --> 00:35:07,985
Hey, whom did you say thank you to?

to help every beggar settle down.

540

That's great, Meena.

546
00:35:37,182 --> 00:35:38,706
Your son's taken
up a good profession.

From where did you
get this money? - Mom..

548

From where did you get it?

549
00:35:42,287 --> 00:35:43,447
lt's an honest income.

550
00:35:45,323 --> 00:35:48,087
Look, we haven't
done anything wrong.

551

Please hear me out.

552

''Come on!''

557
00:36:14,385 --> 00:36:16,216
''This world always
keeps messing around.''

558
00:36:16,287 --> 00:36:18,118
''Then they chant,
hail Goddess Ganga.''

559
00:36:18,189 --> 00:36:20,020
''This world always
keeps messing around.''

560
00:36:20,091 --> 00:36:21,683
''Then they chant,

00:36:25,497 --> 00:36:27,260
''This world always
keeps messing around.''

''Come on!''

568
00:36:40,512 --> 00:36:41,672
''Come on!''

569
00:36:43,615 --> 00:36:47,176
''This is a crooked world,
it doesn't listen to anyone.''

570
00:36:47,352 --> 00:36:51,015
''Everyone does what they please.''

571
00:36:51,289 --> 00:36:54,725
''Relationships survive
only on money.''

572
00:36:55,026 --> 00:36:58,689
''This vehicle runs on
a mixture of water and petrol.''

573
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:00,520
''A clean body and a dirty mind.''

574
00:37:00,598 --> 00:37:02,361
''They have weird dreams.''

575
00:37:02,433 --> 00:37:04,230
''This world always
keeps messing around.''

576
00:37:04,302 --> 00:37:06,167
''Then they chant,
hail Goddess Ganga.''

579
00:37:09,741 --> 00:37:11,572
''They all do bad deeds.''

580
00:37:11,643 --> 00:37:13,440
''Then they chant,
hail Goddess Ganga.''

581
00:37:13,511 --> 00:37:15,342
''This world always
keeps messing around.''

582
00:37:15,413 --> 00:37:17,472
''Then they chant,

''While talking about billions
they don't sound fake.''

589

''Everything they possess is on loan,
still they look up to date.''

590
00:37:46,578 --> 00:37:48,375
''Eat, drink and enjoy.''

591
00:37:48,446 --> 00:37:50,311
''What kind of a generation
is this, honey?''

592
00:37:50,548 --> 00:37:54,245
''All they eye for is black money.''

593
00:37:54,319 --> 00:37:57,652
''Honesty is now taught by crooks.''

594
00:37:57,722 --> 00:38:01,488
''The person you are trying to
contact is currently unavailable.''

595
00:38:01,593 --> 00:38:03,117
''This world always
keeps messing around.''

596
00:38:03,194 --> 00:38:05,162
''Then they chant,
hail Goddess Ganga.''

597
00:38:05,229 --> 00:38:07,026
''This world always
keeps messing around.''

598
00:38:07,065 --> 00:38:08,657
''Then they chant,
hail Goddess Ganga.''

599
00:38:08,733 --> 00:38:10,598
''They all do bad deeds.''

600
00:38:10,668 --> 00:38:12,465
''Then they chant,
hail Goddess Ganga.''

601
00:38:12,537 --> 00:38:14,300
''This world always
keeps messing around.''

602
00:38:14,439 --> 00:38:17,408
''Then they chant,
hail Goddess Ganga.''

603
00:38:18,142 --> 00:38:21,134
''Hail Goddess Ganga.''

604
00:38:30,788 --> 00:38:32,221
Who was on the line?

605
00:38:33,224 --> 00:38:34,623
One of Bhau's men.

606
00:38:35,193 --> 00:38:36,421
Who's Bhau?

607
00:38:36,527 --> 00:38:38,222
He was a local goon of our area..

608
00:38:38,429 --> 00:38:40,090
..now he has become a dacoit.

609
00:38:40,431 --> 00:38:41,489
What do you mean?

610
00:38:41,733 --> 00:38:44,065
l mean he's the
politician of our area.

611
00:38:45,203 --> 00:38:46,534
Oh.

612
00:38:48,139 --> 00:38:50,334
He wants you to vacate
another building?

613
00:38:50,475 --> 00:38:51,373
Yes.

614
00:38:51,442 --> 00:38:52,773
Can't you refuse it?

615
00:38:53,778 --> 00:38:55,439
No, l will have to go there.

616
00:39:03,855 --> 00:39:05,254
Bhau, that boy is sitting inside.

617
00:39:05,323 --> 00:39:06,483
ls he of any use?
- Yes.

618
00:39:06,557 --> 00:39:08,718
What has he done so far?
- He got Rawat's building vacated.

619
00:39:08,793 --> 00:39:10,658
How long did it take him?
- Three days.

620
00:39:11,763 --> 00:39:13,321
What are you saying?!

621
00:39:15,333 --> 00:39:16,459
What's this?
- Hello, Bhau.

622
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:20,269
What's this?

623
00:39:20,605 --> 00:39:23,506
Son, go call yourfather.
l don't have time.

624
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:26,604
Bhau, he's the one.

625
00:39:28,379 --> 00:39:29,778
What do you mean by he's the one?

626
00:39:30,248 --> 00:39:32,716
He is the one who
vacated Rawat's Building.

627
00:39:36,354 --> 00:39:37,753
You..

628
00:39:38,723 --> 00:39:40,520
You get the buildings vacated?

629
00:39:40,591 --> 00:39:41,751
Yes, sir.

630
00:39:42,193 --> 00:39:43,421
What would you like to have?

631
00:39:43,695 --> 00:39:45,492
Tea? Milk?

632
00:39:45,697 --> 00:39:46,789
Let's get to business.

633
00:39:46,864 --> 00:39:47,888
He's the one.
- l told you

634
00:39:48,166 --> 00:39:49,224
He's the one.

635
00:39:51,402 --> 00:39:53,131
First let me tell you the price.

636
00:39:54,672 --> 00:39:57,641
For you, 20 lakhs rupees.

637
00:40:02,313 --> 00:40:04,042
l don't take up illicit jobs.

638
00:40:04,115 --> 00:40:06,049
l'll take your leave.
- Hey! - Sit! Sit! Sit!

639
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:08,209
Sit down.
What's your problem? Sit down.

640
00:40:08,386 --> 00:40:09,876
Who said it's illicit?

641
00:40:10,121 --> 00:40:12,851
l've learnt it from
the streets where l live.

642
00:40:13,458 --> 00:40:16,359
The more illicit the job,
the higherthe price.

643
00:40:17,261 --> 00:40:19,923
Boss, he's the one.
No doubt about that.

644
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,428
Come close.

645
00:40:25,036 --> 00:40:26,401
l'll tell you something.

646
00:40:26,804 --> 00:40:28,203
You'll benefit from it.

647
00:40:29,006 --> 00:40:31,998
A property worth 300 crores rupees has
been stuck since the past 6 months.

648
00:40:32,877 --> 00:40:36,836
20 lakh rupees is a small
price to get it started.

649
00:40:37,548 --> 00:40:39,948
lt's okay if you
want to do it cheaper.

650
00:40:40,151 --> 00:40:41,550
We will adjust

651
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:45,778
So what do you say?

652
00:40:51,529 --> 00:40:52,894
Okay, sir.

653
00:40:53,064 --> 00:40:53,962
Get him some tea.

654
00:40:54,031 --> 00:40:56,397
No, get him some tea.
You will have tea, right?

655
00:40:56,467 --> 00:40:57,434
You won't have milk, right?

656
00:40:57,535 --> 00:40:59,264
l'll call fortea.

657
00:41:03,007 --> 00:41:05,407
You'll be settled
for life afterthis job.

658
00:41:06,944 --> 00:41:09,105
Then l'll go back.

659
00:41:11,249 --> 00:41:12,876
Do you have to go back?

660
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:17,287
l will have to go.

661
00:41:23,027 --> 00:41:27,088
l'm not a very emotional person
but l'll miss you.

662
00:41:33,971 --> 00:41:35,563
l too, will miss you.

663
00:42:29,093 --> 00:42:32,153
l've seen many people who've
sold themselves for money.

664
00:42:32,830 --> 00:42:35,298
But this is the first time
l'm seeing a ghost doing that.

665
00:42:35,666 --> 00:42:36,758
Well done.

666
00:42:38,903 --> 00:42:42,100
How much money is Bhau
giving you to get rid of me?

667
00:42:44,742 --> 00:42:45,868
How much?

668
00:42:46,744 --> 00:42:47,733
20 lakh rupees.

669
00:42:47,812 --> 00:42:49,837
And do you know how much
money are those people getting..

670
00:42:50,047 --> 00:42:52,072
..from whom this land was
snatched to make this building?

671
00:42:54,418 --> 00:42:55,680
Zero.

672
00:42:55,953 --> 00:42:57,716
Look, we didn't know
anything about it.

673
00:42:57,788 --> 00:42:59,380
What do you know?

674
00:43:00,424 --> 00:43:03,154
You helped few spirits cross over

675
00:43:03,261 --> 00:43:05,024
Made a few corrupt
officers fall in line

676
00:43:05,096 --> 00:43:07,291
And you think you have
made this world a better place!

677
00:43:08,232 --> 00:43:09,256
Do you think this..

678
00:43:09,333 --> 00:43:11,426
..building's problem will
get solved once you get rid of me?

679
00:43:12,937 --> 00:43:14,302
How will you get rid of them?

680
00:43:25,182 --> 00:43:26,479
They..

681
00:43:26,984 --> 00:43:28,212
All of them..

682
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:30,480
Those who didn't
vacate their houses..

683
00:43:31,722 --> 00:43:33,383
..their houses were burnt down..

684
00:43:36,861 --> 00:43:39,056
..those who didn't sell themselves,
their deaths were bought..

685
00:43:42,066 --> 00:43:46,867
..and people like me, who tried
to raise their voice, were silenced.

686
00:43:47,238 --> 00:43:48,364
And no one did anything?

687
00:43:48,439 --> 00:43:50,304
What can anyone do?

688
00:43:51,509 --> 00:43:54,103
This cancer is not restricted
to one part of the country.

689
00:43:54,178 --> 00:43:56,271
lt has spread all
across the country.

690
00:43:56,447 --> 00:43:58,347
lf you cure the
cancer in Dombivali..

691
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:01,878
..then what about Kandivali?
What about Dadar?

692
00:44:01,953 --> 00:44:03,511
Will you cure the whole of Mumbai?

693
00:44:04,488 --> 00:44:06,752
What about Delhi?
What about Ludhiana?

694
00:44:06,791 --> 00:44:09,089
Ranchi, Rotak, Jabalpur,
Patna, Surat..

695
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:10,422
From where all will
you get rid of the cancer?

696
00:44:10,494 --> 00:44:12,359
And how much cancer
will you get rid of?

697
00:44:13,931 --> 00:44:16,525
On one hand those who can change this
are just twiddling theirthumbs.

698
00:44:16,968 --> 00:44:18,230
On the other, people like Bhau..

699
00:44:18,302 --> 00:44:20,930
..have themselves become cancer
and are ruining the country.

700
00:44:21,005 --> 00:44:24,099
And people like me,
who raise their voices, are killed.

701
00:44:24,375 --> 00:44:26,275
lt makes it to the
newspaper headline..

702
00:44:26,344 --> 00:44:28,812
..and the next day
everything becomes normal.

703
00:44:30,781 --> 00:44:32,078
People are sleeping.

704
00:44:33,517 --> 00:44:34,779
This country is dying.

705
00:44:37,221 --> 00:44:38,415
Let it die.

706
00:44:45,162 --> 00:44:47,494
Don't make a business
out of someone's death.

707
00:44:49,166 --> 00:44:50,861
lf it had happened to you then...

708
00:44:55,306 --> 00:44:56,796
Go away from here.

709
00:44:58,342 --> 00:44:59,969
Whether anyone does
something or not..

710
00:45:01,512 --> 00:45:03,503
..l won't let any building
stand over here.

711
00:45:05,483 --> 00:45:06,882
Leave!

712
00:45:21,999 --> 00:45:22,556
Am l smiling right?

713
00:45:22,633 --> 00:45:23,930
Yes, Bhau.
- Okay. Good.

714
00:45:24,001 --> 00:45:25,935
Now take one in this pose.
Now this pose.

715
00:45:26,003 --> 00:45:28,233
One more. Click one more.
- Yes.

716
00:45:28,305 --> 00:45:30,466
This.. this is a famous pose.

717
00:45:30,608 --> 00:45:32,371
Click it.. click it

718
00:45:32,476 --> 00:45:33,238
Bhau?

719
00:45:33,444 --> 00:45:34,638
That building boy is here.

720
00:45:35,179 --> 00:45:36,305
He says he can't do the job.

721
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:39,042
Why? What happened?
- He says it's not his cup of tea.

722
00:45:39,316 --> 00:45:40,340
Send him in.

723
00:45:40,418 --> 00:45:41,942
Akhrot.
- You move aside.

724
00:45:42,019 --> 00:45:43,145
Come here.

725
00:45:43,687 --> 00:45:45,382
Akhrot, come here.

726
00:45:47,691 --> 00:45:49,716
What happened?
- l cannot do it.

727
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:51,484
What?
- l can't.

728
00:45:51,595 --> 00:45:53,153
Did anyone say anything?

729
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:58,295
You need more money?

730
00:46:00,037 --> 00:46:01,004
Tell me!

731
00:46:01,072 --> 00:46:02,334
l told you, l cannot do it!

732
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:06,604
Hey, you cannot afford
to say no to me.

733
00:46:09,113 --> 00:46:11,377
You are lucky the elections
are around the corner.

734
00:46:11,682 --> 00:46:13,650
Otherwise l'd chop you and
throw you in the same gutter..

735
00:46:13,717 --> 00:46:15,309
..that you came from.

736
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:18,980
Now quietly get
the building vacated.

737
00:46:19,423 --> 00:46:21,550
You have time only
until the elections.

738
00:46:21,992 --> 00:46:23,220
Got it?

739
00:46:23,294 --> 00:46:25,694
You only have time
until the elections.

740
00:46:25,763 --> 00:46:27,128
Go.

741
00:46:27,531 --> 00:46:28,725
Go!

742
00:46:31,502 --> 00:46:34,130
At least let me smile.

743
00:46:38,375 --> 00:46:42,038
Bhau held me by my collar
and you didn't do a thing.

744
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:44,307
ls this ourfriendship?

745
00:46:45,416 --> 00:46:46,678
Then what should have l done?

746
00:46:47,318 --> 00:46:48,410
What should have l done?

747
00:46:49,019 --> 00:46:52,147
Today Bhau has held you by your
collartomorrow someone else will.

748
00:46:53,424 --> 00:46:55,221
From whom all will l save you?

749
00:46:55,292 --> 00:46:56,350
Didn't you hear
what that ghost said?

750
00:46:56,427 --> 00:46:58,122
This country is full
of people like Bhau.

751
00:46:58,195 --> 00:47:00,527
Then raise the fear
of good in them as well.

752
00:47:00,598 --> 00:47:03,533
People like Bhau don't fear good

753
00:47:03,767 --> 00:47:06,031
They only fear loss of power.

754
00:47:08,739 --> 00:47:10,570
Then Bhau cannot be scared.

755
00:47:12,042 --> 00:47:15,136
He has very easily won
the past three elections.

756
00:47:18,782 --> 00:47:22,548
Why didn't any good
candidate stand against him?

757
00:47:22,653 --> 00:47:23,779
They did.

758
00:47:24,488 --> 00:47:26,115
Some took the bullet.

759
00:47:26,323 --> 00:47:27,654
Some took the money.

760
00:47:28,726 --> 00:47:30,216
lt's a tradition of our country.

761
00:47:30,327 --> 00:47:31,385
Yes.

762
00:47:33,230 --> 00:47:34,629
There must be someone.

763
00:47:35,232 --> 00:47:39,430
A good candidate who can
stand against Bhau this time.

764
00:47:39,637 --> 00:47:41,070
There must be someone.

765
00:47:44,074 --> 00:47:45,405
Why don't you?

766
00:47:45,809 --> 00:47:47,401
You are good.

767
00:47:48,345 --> 00:47:50,506
And no one can kill you either.

768
00:47:56,954 --> 00:47:57,978
What do you think?

769
00:47:58,322 --> 00:48:00,119
Very bad idea.

770
00:48:00,457 --> 00:48:02,618
Why? Because it is not your idea,
it is bad?

771
00:48:02,693 --> 00:48:04,217
Don't behave like a kid

772
00:48:04,295 --> 00:48:05,626
l am a kid.

773
00:48:07,164 --> 00:48:08,995
A dead person can't
contest elections.

774
00:48:09,066 --> 00:48:10,055
How can he?

775
00:48:10,167 --> 00:48:13,102
ls there such a rule?
- Then what!

776
00:48:14,605 --> 00:48:17,165
What strange rules our country has.

777
00:48:18,309 --> 00:48:20,709
You find one good person
with great difficulty.

778
00:48:21,011 --> 00:48:22,501
And they have a problem
with that also.

779
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:25,274
This is what we call
democracy, kiddo.

780
00:48:25,416 --> 00:48:26,678
Who's crazy?

781
00:48:30,054 --> 00:48:31,351
Let it be.

782
00:48:39,630 --> 00:48:41,222
You still haven't slept?

783
00:48:44,368 --> 00:48:45,665
What are you thinking about?

784
00:48:46,237 --> 00:48:48,762
l'm thinking what will
happen to our country.

785
00:48:50,007 --> 00:48:52,066
Those who need to
think are sleeping.

786
00:48:52,209 --> 00:48:53,471
You too should go to sleep.

787
00:49:00,684 --> 00:49:03,175
Please contest in the elections..

788
00:49:05,356 --> 00:49:06,755
Yourtape recorder has started again

789
00:49:07,024 --> 00:49:09,788
l told you, a ghost cannot
contest for elections.

790
00:49:10,094 --> 00:49:11,026
Look..

791
00:49:12,496 --> 00:49:16,523
..l know a failed lawyer.
Let's check with him.

792
00:49:18,469 --> 00:49:20,767
lt doesn't cost us to ask.

793
00:49:21,138 --> 00:49:22,469
Come on.

794
00:49:29,113 --> 00:49:30,102
Let's go.
- Yes.

795
00:49:34,618 --> 00:49:35,550
What are you saying?

796
00:49:35,619 --> 00:49:38,520
l should shut down my
factory and open a bangle shop?

797
00:49:39,156 --> 00:49:40,783
Or you want me to consume
iron and commit suicide.

798
00:49:41,058 --> 00:49:42,616
Now get back to work

799
00:49:42,693 --> 00:49:44,558
He..
- You work for me.

800
00:49:44,628 --> 00:49:46,823
He's a lawyer?
- Now go and get it again.

801
00:49:47,097 --> 00:49:47,756
He was.

802
00:49:48,165 --> 00:49:51,794
Law has no place for
a nice people like him.

803
00:49:52,102 --> 00:49:54,093
l hope he is not faint-hearted.

804
00:49:55,172 --> 00:49:57,663
Who are you lying to?

805
00:49:57,741 --> 00:49:59,834
Here, have some tea and go home.

806
00:50:00,077 --> 00:50:02,238
Look Gabdi, you know l don't lie.

807
00:50:02,313 --> 00:50:06,079
You mean to say that there
is a ghost in my factory?

808
00:50:06,150 --> 00:50:06,844
Yes.

809
00:50:07,151 --> 00:50:08,641
Crazy.

810
00:50:25,969 --> 00:50:26,867
Who..

811
00:50:27,504 --> 00:50:29,267
Who is he?

812
00:50:29,506 --> 00:50:30,632
How are you, Mr. Gabdi?

813
00:50:30,874 --> 00:50:32,535
He took my name?

814
00:50:35,079 --> 00:50:37,104
l asked, how are you?

815
00:50:38,215 --> 00:50:40,615
Sir, l am absolutely
fine with your grace.

816
00:50:40,884 --> 00:50:43,045
How can l help you?

817
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:47,051
l needed a legal advice.

818
00:50:47,324 --> 00:50:49,952
l understand, sir.
Old lndian problem.

819
00:50:50,027 --> 00:50:53,326
A person's life comes to
an end but his case never ends.

820
00:50:53,397 --> 00:50:55,228
Don't drag this like a court case.

821
00:50:55,299 --> 00:50:57,563
Just answer my question.

822
00:50:58,001 --> 00:50:59,935
That too in short.

823
00:51:00,270 --> 00:51:01,362
Tell us..

824
00:51:01,438 --> 00:51:05,101
..what kind of a person can
contest the Lok Sabha elections?

825
00:51:05,275 --> 00:51:07,072
Why?

826
00:51:07,211 --> 00:51:09,304
Don't ask questions, just answer.

827
00:51:12,149 --> 00:51:13,912
According to the rule book, sir..

828
00:51:14,051 --> 00:51:17,452
..the candidate should
be an lndian citizen.

829
00:51:18,122 --> 00:51:19,020
He is.

830
00:51:19,189 --> 00:51:20,588
But who is contesting?

831
00:51:22,025 --> 00:51:23,151
Continue.

832
00:51:24,962 --> 00:51:27,624
He should be at least 25 years old.

833
00:51:28,065 --> 00:51:29,930
25..

834
00:51:31,001 --> 00:51:32,059
He is.

835
00:51:32,169 --> 00:51:33,534
No criminal record.

836
00:51:33,604 --> 00:51:35,037
No. Not at all.

837
00:51:35,105 --> 00:51:36,470
He should be mentally sound.

838
00:51:36,540 --> 00:51:37,939
He is.

839
00:51:39,576 --> 00:51:41,942
That's all.
- That's all?

840
00:51:42,012 --> 00:51:44,310
That's all. - No educational
qualification is required?

841
00:51:44,448 --> 00:51:46,211
What education qualification?
A degree in what?

842
00:51:46,283 --> 00:51:48,308
That means a person who isn't
even eligible to get a clerk's job..

843
00:51:48,385 --> 00:51:49,545
..can actually run our country.

844
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:52,088
What can one do?
This is lndia. Hail lndia.

845
00:51:52,556 --> 00:51:53,488
Anything else?

846
00:51:53,557 --> 00:51:55,286
Yes, one last question.

847
00:51:55,359 --> 00:51:57,259
What?
- The one contesting..

848
00:51:57,327 --> 00:51:59,454
The one who is contesting
in the elections..

849
00:51:59,530 --> 00:52:00,554
Yes.

850
00:52:00,731 --> 00:52:02,699
..does he need to be alive?

851
00:52:05,636 --> 00:52:06,660
No. No, no.

852
00:52:06,737 --> 00:52:10,138
lt's not said so in any rule book.
ln any book whatsoever.

853
00:52:10,407 --> 00:52:11,499
No.

854
00:52:11,675 --> 00:52:12,972
Thank you.

855
00:52:17,114 --> 00:52:18,308
Akhrot..

856
00:52:20,984 --> 00:52:21,973
Akhrot..

857
00:52:22,619 --> 00:52:24,018
Hey, come on, man.
At least hear me out.

858
00:52:24,087 --> 00:52:25,247
No, l don't want to hear anything.

859
00:52:25,322 --> 00:52:26,619
Think about it.

860
00:52:27,758 --> 00:52:29,623
You asked me to come
with you to a lawyer. l came

861
00:52:29,726 --> 00:52:31,455
Now l won't get into
the mess of elections.

862
00:52:31,528 --> 00:52:33,155
l won't be contesting
in any elections.

863
00:52:39,636 --> 00:52:44,073
Look, it's not fair
for such people to win.

864
00:52:45,409 --> 00:52:47,434
You are only thinking
about yourself.

865
00:52:47,511 --> 00:52:49,445
Think about our country as well.

866
00:52:53,650 --> 00:52:55,641
Look, what state our country is in.

867
00:53:22,813 --> 00:53:26,749
''Lord, keep an eye.''

868
00:53:26,850 --> 00:53:30,308
''Almighty, keep an eye.''

869
00:53:30,854 --> 00:53:34,620
''Lord, keep an eye.''

870
00:53:34,825 --> 00:53:38,261
''Almighty, keep an eye.''

871
00:53:39,196 --> 00:53:42,825
''May everyone get your
blessings and grace.''

872
00:53:42,933 --> 00:53:46,528
''Be concerned about everyone.''

873
00:53:46,904 --> 00:53:50,362
''Lord, keep an eye.''

874
00:53:50,841 --> 00:53:54,436
''Almighty, keep an eye.''

875
00:54:11,261 --> 00:54:18,497
''No man should ever endure slavery.''

876
00:54:19,002 --> 00:54:26,534
''No man should bow before another.''

877
00:54:27,244 --> 00:54:34,650
''May all the differences resolve.''

878
00:54:35,018 --> 00:54:42,618
''Distribute this land
and the sky equally among all.''

879
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:46,921
''No one should be in pain.''

880
00:54:47,297 --> 00:54:50,425
''Be concerned about everyone.''

881
00:54:50,968 --> 00:54:54,563
''Lord, keep an eye.''

882
00:54:55,272 --> 00:54:58,298
''Almighty, keep an eye.''

883
00:54:59,042 --> 00:55:02,705
''Lord, keep an eye.''

884
00:55:03,313 --> 00:55:06,680
''Almighty, keep an eye.''

885
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:27,061
''Everyone should
hold their head high.''

886
00:55:27,371 --> 00:55:30,465
''Give this strength to everyone.''

887
00:55:31,408 --> 00:55:38,644
''No one should be able
to silence a rising voice, Lord.''

888
00:55:39,349 --> 00:55:43,308
''May everyone get some work to do.''

889
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:46,981
''And everyone should
get a chance to rest.''

890
00:55:47,391 --> 00:55:54,729
''A person who works hard,
his hard work should pay.''

891
00:55:55,399 --> 00:56:02,669
''Keep a watch,
on every deed, on every thought.''

892
00:56:03,106 --> 00:56:07,338
''Lord, keep an eye.''

893
00:56:07,511 --> 00:56:10,810
''Almighty, keep an eye.''

894
00:56:11,014 --> 00:56:14,973
''Lord, keep an eye.''

895
00:56:15,519 --> 00:56:19,615
''Almighty, keep an eye.''

896
00:56:19,956 --> 00:56:21,651
''Lord!''

897
00:56:25,529 --> 00:56:27,793
''Lord!''

898
00:56:32,469 --> 00:56:36,405
''Lord!''

899
00:56:49,553 --> 00:56:52,113
So, what do you say?

900
00:56:53,690 --> 00:56:55,385
What?
- What do you say?

901
00:57:02,566 --> 00:57:08,095
Even if l contest in the elections,
who'll vote for a ghost?

902
00:57:08,538 --> 00:57:10,005
lt will be a joke.

903
00:57:11,408 --> 00:57:12,397
You are too young to vote.

904
00:57:12,476 --> 00:57:13,500
'l am no more' to vote.

905
00:57:13,577 --> 00:57:15,272
We won't get a single vote.

906
00:57:16,346 --> 00:57:18,007
What if we get one vote?

907
00:57:18,548 --> 00:57:20,038
From where will you get it?

908
00:57:20,751 --> 00:57:22,082
Damn them!

909
00:57:22,185 --> 00:57:25,416
l hope they don't get
waterwhen they are dying.

910
00:57:25,555 --> 00:57:28,319
How should we poor people survive?

911
00:57:28,425 --> 00:57:30,188
One never gets water!

912
00:57:30,393 --> 00:57:31,724
What if you get one vote?

913
00:57:33,697 --> 00:57:35,358
Then l'll think about it.

914
00:57:35,799 --> 00:57:38,063
l'll get you one vote for sure..

915
00:57:40,403 --> 00:57:41,335
Aunty..

916
00:57:42,105 --> 00:57:43,697
Can l ask you a question?

917
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:45,302
Please don't get angry.

918
00:57:46,476 --> 00:57:50,674
lf from our area,
a ghost contests in the elections..

919
00:57:50,781 --> 00:57:52,043
A ghost?
- Yes.

920
00:57:52,115 --> 00:57:54,777
l mean someone who will
get the roads repaired,

921
00:57:55,051 --> 00:57:56,382
gets the gutters cleaned,

922
00:57:56,586 --> 00:57:58,520
gets rid of all the garbage,

923
00:57:58,588 --> 00:58:00,715
and gets water in these taps,

924
00:58:00,791 --> 00:58:03,055
will you vote for him?

925
00:58:03,260 --> 00:58:10,564
Son, these unpaved roads,
overflowing gutters, garbage..

926
00:58:11,067 --> 00:58:13,467
We are used to it.

927
00:58:14,070 --> 00:58:18,302
lf anyone can get water
even once during the day..

928
00:58:18,575 --> 00:58:22,341
Then forget a ghost,
l'll even vote for a dog!

929
00:58:22,679 --> 00:58:23,839
Yes.

930
00:58:24,114 --> 00:58:28,210
People couldn't get us water.
Don't be stupid.

931
00:58:28,351 --> 00:58:30,546
You think a ghost will get us water?

932
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:51,532
Oh really?

933
00:58:53,410 --> 00:58:54,377
Are you sure?

934
00:58:55,812 --> 00:58:59,578
By God.
You guys are getting serious.

935
00:58:59,816 --> 00:59:03,411
Yes. - No, no, no.
As you please. As you please.

936
00:59:03,653 --> 00:59:06,087
But as your lawyer..

937
00:59:07,791 --> 00:59:10,521
l am your lawyer, right?

938
00:59:12,629 --> 00:59:13,561
Yes.
- Yes.

939
00:59:13,630 --> 00:59:19,068
Yes, so as your lawyer, it is
my duty to tell you a few things..

940
00:59:19,135 --> 00:59:20,102
Like?

941
00:59:20,170 --> 00:59:23,333
Like you filing a nomination
can cause a big commotion.

942
00:59:23,406 --> 00:59:24,532
Are you getting me?

943
00:59:24,608 --> 00:59:28,476
So, we need to keep
all the papers in order.

944
00:59:28,812 --> 00:59:32,714
So that in future the opposition
doesn't disqualify your nomination.

945
00:59:32,782 --> 00:59:34,249
Are you getting it?

946
00:59:35,151 --> 00:59:36,209
What kind of documents?

947
00:59:36,286 --> 00:59:40,245
l'll handle everything,
you just need to get two documents.

948
00:59:40,557 --> 00:59:43,549
A police certificate
that he is not a criminal.

949
00:59:43,627 --> 00:59:48,428
And a doctor's certificate
stating he is mentally stable.

950
00:59:50,133 --> 00:59:53,432
A common man always prays that..

951
00:59:53,803 --> 00:59:57,864
.. he never has to visit a doctor,
lawyer orthe police.

952
00:59:59,442 --> 01:00:01,171
And l am about to
face all three of them.

953
01:00:01,244 --> 01:00:03,439
Sir, please strike
out lawyerfrom your list.

954
01:00:03,513 --> 01:00:04,411
Why?

955
01:00:04,481 --> 01:00:06,711
What ''why''?
Some lawyers can be honest as well.

956
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:08,751
Keep it down, Gabdi.
- Why?

957
01:00:08,818 --> 01:00:10,786
Otherwise,
they will place you in a museum.

958
01:00:15,125 --> 01:00:18,185
Stop it! Are you planning
to mend the whole world orwhat?

959
01:00:18,628 --> 01:00:19,788
He's crazy.

960
01:00:24,167 --> 01:00:25,134
Sir..

961
01:00:26,336 --> 01:00:27,530
Sir..
- Yes?

962
01:00:28,471 --> 01:00:31,531
A ghost has come to meet you.

963
01:00:32,142 --> 01:00:35,771
Shinde, how many times have
l told you not to drink on duty?

964
01:00:35,845 --> 01:00:38,439
l swear, sir. Neverwhile on duty.

965
01:00:38,615 --> 01:00:39,582
l'm telling the truth.

966
01:00:39,649 --> 01:00:41,674
There is a ghost outside.

967
01:00:42,852 --> 01:00:45,753
ls he here because we
suppressed his murder case?

968
01:00:46,356 --> 01:00:47,880
No, not forthat.

969
01:00:48,224 --> 01:00:52,684
He wishes to contest in the election.
He wants a clearance letterfor it.

970
01:00:55,298 --> 01:00:56,890
A ghost will contest
in the election?

971
01:00:57,934 --> 01:01:00,164
Please do it, sir.
lt's a little urgent.

972
01:01:02,472 --> 01:01:04,702
Who said that?
- Not me.

973
01:01:04,874 --> 01:01:07,240
lt's me, sir. Bhoothnath.

974
01:01:07,577 --> 01:01:09,306
Please do it. lt's a little urgent.

975
01:01:09,779 --> 01:01:13,613
Everyone comes here
with urgent work.

976
01:01:13,717 --> 01:01:16,481
Someone got stabbed.
That's urgent.

977
01:01:16,619 --> 01:01:19,611
Someone got hit by a drunk.
That's urgent.

978
01:01:19,756 --> 01:01:21,690
A politician's sandals
got stolen from outside a temple.

979
01:01:21,758 --> 01:01:22,725
That's urgent.

980
01:01:22,792 --> 01:01:25,590
A celebrity's dog is lost.
That's urgent.

981
01:01:25,729 --> 01:01:27,754
To clean up the city is urgent,

982
01:01:27,897 --> 01:01:29,831
so are we detergents?

983
01:01:31,534 --> 01:01:34,731
lnside the hearts of this country's
population there's only frustration.

984
01:01:34,938 --> 01:01:37,270
Outside the system's constipation,
the situation is such..

985
01:01:37,340 --> 01:01:39,331
..that everywhere
there's saturation.

986
01:01:39,476 --> 01:01:43,503
Public wants to know, what's the
justification of this intoxication?

987
01:01:43,646 --> 01:01:46,638
There is right to information,
but to that there is objection.

988
01:01:46,716 --> 01:01:49,549
Police has the power,
but it has its own limitation.

989
01:01:49,686 --> 01:01:52,211
The one who has designation
doesn't have the intention.

990
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:54,280
The one who has suggestion,
doesn't have the position.

991
01:01:54,357 --> 01:01:56,825
What should people do in such
a situation, that's my question.

992
01:02:02,465 --> 01:02:03,989
l'll do something, Mr. Ghost.

993
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:05,294
l'll do something.

994
01:02:05,402 --> 01:02:08,030
But there's something
l can't understand.

995
01:02:08,171 --> 01:02:10,230
Do you wish to embezzle
the people's money?

996
01:02:10,306 --> 01:02:11,000
No.

997
01:02:11,074 --> 01:02:13,838
Do you want illicit
land in yourfamily's name?

998
01:02:13,877 --> 01:02:14,571
No.

999
01:02:14,844 --> 01:02:16,971
Do you want to make a foreign
trip on public fund?

1000
01:02:17,047 --> 01:02:17,945
No.

1001
01:02:18,014 --> 01:02:20,005
Then do you wish to do social
service by becoming a politician?

1002
01:02:20,116 --> 01:02:20,980
Yes.

1003
01:02:21,484 --> 01:02:22,508
Yes?

1004
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:25,019
Damn, he's impossible.
- Yes.

1005
01:02:25,188 --> 01:02:27,315
He didn't come to his
senses even after death.

1006
01:02:27,991 --> 01:02:28,980
Go.

1007
01:02:29,059 --> 01:02:30,026
l'll check all your records.

1008
01:02:30,293 --> 01:02:31,988
lf everything's well then l'll
give you an ''all clear'' certificate.

1009
01:02:32,062 --> 01:02:33,290
Okay?
- Thank you, sir.

1010
01:02:33,396 --> 01:02:34,488
See you.

1011
01:02:37,267 --> 01:02:38,859
Shinde..
- Yes?

1012
01:02:39,202 --> 01:02:41,193
Didn't you see him coming inside?

1013
01:02:41,538 --> 01:02:43,506
Sir, how could l see him?

1014
01:02:43,873 --> 01:02:45,101
And we are law enforcers.

1015
01:02:45,175 --> 01:02:47,200
And law is blind..
- l know. l know.

1016
01:02:47,944 --> 01:02:50,037
There's something
that's confusing me.

1017
01:02:50,213 --> 01:02:53,307
For you, should l give a normal
report or a post mortem report?

1018
01:02:53,450 --> 01:02:54,610
l didn't get you, sir.

1019
01:02:54,884 --> 01:02:57,580
Look, for someone who is dead,
a doctor gives a post mortem report.

1020
01:02:57,654 --> 01:03:02,318
But how can a post mortem report
tell if a person is insane or not?

1021
01:03:03,159 --> 01:03:05,150
Sir, post mortem is
done on the dead body.

1022
01:03:05,228 --> 01:03:06,923
And l am a soul.

1023
01:03:07,363 --> 01:03:09,456
And a soul lives forever.

1024
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:12,095
And hence, l am alive.

1025
01:03:12,168 --> 01:03:13,635
So perform a test that you
would on someone who is alive.

1026
01:03:13,903 --> 01:03:15,393
Yes, yes. You got a point there.

1027
01:03:15,472 --> 01:03:17,099
Sir, you are a psychiatrist.

1028
01:03:17,173 --> 01:03:18,936
lt is not right for
you to get confused.

1029
01:03:19,008 --> 01:03:20,908
l am confused?

1030
01:03:20,944 --> 01:03:24,038
Now watch me confuse you.

1031
01:03:24,180 --> 01:03:27,513
Yes. l'll do an inkblot test on you.

1032
01:03:28,585 --> 01:03:30,018
Look at this.

1033
01:03:30,220 --> 01:03:32,017
What do you see in it?

1034
01:03:32,088 --> 01:03:33,419
Sachin's century.

1035
01:03:34,357 --> 01:03:36,985
l knew you were crazy.

1036
01:03:37,193 --> 01:03:38,956
How can you see..

1037
01:03:39,696 --> 01:03:41,095
Was l wrong, sir?

1038
01:03:42,365 --> 01:03:43,525
No.

1039
01:03:47,170 --> 01:03:48,694
What do you see in this?

1040
01:03:48,938 --> 01:03:51,202
Draupadi's disrobing scene.

1041
01:03:52,942 --> 01:03:53,636
Oh God!

1042
01:03:53,710 --> 01:03:56,270
And here, a sinking Titanic.

1043
01:03:56,379 --> 01:04:00,110
And at the moment you are
holding my ''OK'' certificate.

1044
01:04:00,483 --> 01:04:01,973
Yes.

1045
01:04:02,352 --> 01:04:03,944
Then take it.

1046
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:05,246
Take it.

1047
01:04:08,658 --> 01:04:10,091
l've handled the police.

1048
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:11,058
Great.

1049
01:04:11,261 --> 01:04:12,455
l've taken care
of the doctor as well.

1050
01:04:12,529 --> 01:04:13,496
Great.

1051
01:04:13,563 --> 01:04:15,292
Now?
- Great.

1052
01:04:15,532 --> 01:04:16,328
What!

1053
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:19,968
l mean the election officer.

1054
01:04:20,436 --> 01:04:21,698
The election officer?

1055
01:04:47,564 --> 01:04:50,192
So, who is contesting
in the election?

1056
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:52,161
A ghost.

1057
01:04:53,269 --> 01:04:56,466
Look, l don't have
time for your silly jokes.

1058
01:04:56,539 --> 01:04:58,530
This is not a joke, sir.

1059
01:05:00,743 --> 01:05:04,110
l am extremely serious
about contesting this election.

1060
01:05:06,049 --> 01:05:07,311
Really? - Yes.

1061
01:05:07,383 --> 01:05:09,351
There is nothing in
the rule book that states..

1062
01:05:09,419 --> 01:05:12,547
..that the person contesting
the election should be alive.

1063
01:05:12,722 --> 01:05:14,121
This..

1064
01:05:14,257 --> 01:05:17,351
Yes. There is no such rule..

1065
01:05:21,364 --> 01:05:22,558
Alright.

1066
01:05:23,466 --> 01:05:25,627
Who is proposing it?
- l am. l am his lawyer.

1067
01:05:25,702 --> 01:05:28,068
My name is Gabdi Kumar.

1068
01:05:28,638 --> 01:05:30,071
From which party?

1069
01:05:30,106 --> 01:05:31,368
An lndependent candidate.

1070
01:05:31,574 --> 01:05:33,371
You'll need to pay
10000 rupees forthis.

1071
01:05:33,476 --> 01:05:34,670
Here you go.

1072
01:05:35,678 --> 01:05:38,545
And ten people to nominate you.

1073
01:05:38,615 --> 01:05:39,843
Sure.

1074
01:05:40,583 --> 01:05:42,073
Alive.

1075
01:05:54,831 --> 01:05:56,731
What times have come!

1076
01:05:57,300 --> 01:06:00,098
Now even ghosts contest elections.

1077
01:06:00,169 --> 01:06:02,865
Sir, you have been conducting
elections for so many years.

1078
01:06:03,106 --> 01:06:05,540
You've seen many dishonest people

1079
01:06:05,608 --> 01:06:07,371
l am just an ordinary ghost.

1080
01:06:07,443 --> 01:06:11,880
We also want good people
to contest the election.

1081
01:06:12,115 --> 01:06:14,640
Yes.
- lf not alive, so be it.

1082
01:06:19,355 --> 01:06:22,415
This needs to be signed.

1083
01:06:22,492 --> 01:06:23,823
Sure.

1084
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:25,127
Sign.

1085
01:07:04,834 --> 01:07:05,858
Lallan.

1086
01:07:14,710 --> 01:07:17,270
Lallan, once again please.

1087
01:07:17,647 --> 01:07:19,376
Please say that once again.

1088
01:07:20,149 --> 01:07:21,207
Bhau, you..

1089
01:07:23,152 --> 01:07:25,814
Sit down. Sit down. Shut up!

1090
01:07:26,822 --> 01:07:28,221
Lallan.

1091
01:07:33,195 --> 01:07:35,060
Bhau, a ghost is
contesting against you.

1092
01:07:45,074 --> 01:07:48,043
That's very smart of the opposition.

1093
01:07:48,210 --> 01:07:51,771
Now they won't have to
hide theirface when they lose.

1094
01:07:52,815 --> 01:07:54,009
l am not joking.

1095
01:07:54,250 --> 01:07:56,184
A ghost is contesting against you.

1096
01:08:02,058 --> 01:08:04,083
Then your job is in danger, Lallan.

1097
01:08:04,427 --> 01:08:05,325
Why?

1098
01:08:05,461 --> 01:08:07,395
Whose throat will
you slit this time?

1099
01:08:13,869 --> 01:08:15,029
Lallan..

1100
01:08:17,473 --> 01:08:22,001
This country's heating political
situation got some comic relief..

1101
01:08:22,078 --> 01:08:26,777
..when a ghost decided to contest
elections from Dharavi constituency of Mumbai.

1102
01:08:26,916 --> 01:08:28,975
The ghost of election
takes overthe country.

1103
01:08:29,051 --> 01:08:31,349
ls this the darkest day
in the history of democracy?

1104
01:08:31,420 --> 01:08:35,117
Can this be really happening?
- The country's politics has hit a new low.

1105
01:08:35,257 --> 01:08:37,725
Now parties are fielding
ghosts as candidates.

1106
01:08:38,494 --> 01:08:40,189
l told you so.
But you paid no heed to me.

1107
01:08:40,262 --> 01:08:42,321
Now they are making fun of us.

1108
01:08:43,466 --> 01:08:45,400
ls the ghost they are talking
about on the news yourfriend?

1109
01:08:45,468 --> 01:08:49,063
Yes, mom. l tried to talk him out.
But he never listens.

1110
01:08:49,805 --> 01:08:51,238
Now they are making fun of us.

1111
01:08:51,307 --> 01:08:53,002
Look Akhrot,
you better stay out of it.

1112
01:08:53,075 --> 01:08:54,975
No, mom. l'm staying out of it.

1113
01:08:55,044 --> 01:08:56,739
lt's his business not mine.

1114
01:08:56,812 --> 01:08:58,245
l am just supporting
him because he is my friend.

1115
01:08:58,414 --> 01:08:59,938
That too from outside.

1116
01:09:00,016 --> 01:09:01,244
Bhau is a dangerous guy.

1117
01:09:01,350 --> 01:09:03,079
Right. That's what l told him.

1118
01:09:03,152 --> 01:09:05,143
Why are you getting worried?
Look, water has come. Go.

1119
01:09:05,221 --> 01:09:06,153
l don't want any trouble.

1120
01:09:09,125 --> 01:09:10,183
This was my idea?

1121
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:12,887
Look, there is just one person
in your party and that's me.

1122
01:09:12,995 --> 01:09:14,963
lf l leave,
your party will cease to exist.

1123
01:09:15,798 --> 01:09:16,958
What do you want to do?

1124
01:09:19,535 --> 01:09:21,799
l want to show them an
amazing trailer. What else?

1125
01:09:35,851 --> 01:09:37,250
Did that ring a bell?

1126
01:09:38,187 --> 01:09:39,484
Or do you want some more?

1127
01:09:48,898 --> 01:09:52,732
Something that was making you laugh
until yesterday will shock you today.

1128
01:09:52,935 --> 01:09:54,835
Because this time
from Dharavi in Mumbai..

1129
01:09:54,904 --> 01:09:58,203
..a ghost is actually
going to contest the election.

1130
01:10:00,309 --> 01:10:03,005
And he is at the moment
with us in the studio.

1131
01:10:03,145 --> 01:10:04,737
Mr. Bhoothnath..
- Yes.

1132
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:09,146
.. why should our viewers believe
that you are actually a ghost?

1133
01:10:09,652 --> 01:10:11,643
lt is not theirfault.

1134
01:10:11,854 --> 01:10:13,287
lf l would've been alive today..

1135
01:10:13,622 --> 01:10:15,146
.. then perhaps l too
wouldn't have believed it.

1136
01:10:15,224 --> 01:10:18,990
But sir, can you do something which
makes our viewers believe that..

1137
01:10:19,095 --> 01:10:20,995
That.. that..

1138
01:10:21,330 --> 01:10:25,323
As you can see,
this is not a camera trick.

1139
01:10:25,768 --> 01:10:28,168
Mr. Bhoothnath is behind it.

1140
01:10:28,938 --> 01:10:30,997
Look, l am not here
to show tricks.

1141
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:34,840
l just want to tell everyone
that this is not a joke.

1142
01:10:35,010 --> 01:10:37,672
l am fighting this election
and l am serious about it.

1143
01:10:37,847 --> 01:10:40,338
This ghost speaks in English.

1144
01:10:40,649 --> 01:10:43,379
Good. At least from somewhere
an educated person is contesting.

1145
01:10:43,652 --> 01:10:46,815
But sir, how can a ghost
stand forthe election?

1146
01:10:46,922 --> 01:10:49,254
No where in the rule
book does it state that..

1147
01:10:49,325 --> 01:10:52,123
..one needs to be alive
to contest the election.

1148
01:10:55,331 --> 01:10:56,958
l told you so.

1149
01:10:57,066 --> 01:10:59,159
Sir, this is causing uproar outside.

1150
01:10:59,268 --> 01:11:00,929
Uproar!

1151
01:11:02,104 --> 01:11:05,835
Why isn't there an uproar
when those who are accused..

1152
01:11:05,908 --> 01:11:09,071
..of embezzling billions
of rupees contest the election?

1153
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:10,710
The ones who are
accused of hooliganism.

1154
01:11:10,780 --> 01:11:12,145
The ones who are accused of murder.

1155
01:11:12,314 --> 01:11:13,246
Right.

1156
01:11:13,382 --> 01:11:15,782
l am just an ordinary ghost.

1157
01:11:15,985 --> 01:11:18,886
Why is my contesting the
election causing such an uproar?

1158
01:11:19,021 --> 01:11:24,049
But sir, what made a
ghost contest the election?

1159
01:11:25,828 --> 01:11:28,319
When it's the question
of our country's future..

1160
01:11:28,864 --> 01:11:29,660
Some of the responsibility..

1161
01:11:29,732 --> 01:11:32,132
..lies on the shoulder
of this country's ghost as well.

1162
01:11:41,143 --> 01:11:43,111
He is here. He is here.

1163
01:11:43,179 --> 01:11:46,080
Just one question, please, sir.
One question, please, sir.

1164
01:11:46,315 --> 01:11:47,282
Sir..
- Sir..

1165
01:11:47,583 --> 01:11:49,278
Okay. Okay.
Just one question.

1166
01:11:49,652 --> 01:11:52,120
Sir, do you think the
public will vote for a ghost?

1167
01:11:53,122 --> 01:11:56,751
l just want to tell
them that l am not a ghost.

1168
01:11:58,694 --> 01:11:59,991
l am the future.

1169
01:12:00,029 --> 01:12:01,360
One more question, sir.
Just one more question, sir.

1170
01:12:01,630 --> 01:12:02,961
Sir. Sir..
- He left.

1171
01:12:03,265 --> 01:12:04,926
Where is he?
- Where is he?

1172
01:12:05,034 --> 01:12:07,901
And what would you
like to stay about this?

1173
01:12:09,672 --> 01:12:10,832
Jai Hind.
(Hail Motherland)

1174
01:12:11,674 --> 01:12:14,040
lsn't he the same building boy?

1175
01:12:14,844 --> 01:12:16,311
khajur (Dates).
- Akhrot.

1176
01:12:16,378 --> 01:12:17,868
Yes, Akhrot.

1177
01:12:19,081 --> 01:12:20,776
What is he doing there?

1178
01:12:27,790 --> 01:12:29,257
You have become very popular.

1179
01:12:30,626 --> 01:12:33,390
This isn't popularity.
This is curiosity.

1180
01:12:33,829 --> 01:12:35,194
Let's go and talk to them.

1181
01:12:35,297 --> 01:12:37,128
Where? There? No.

1182
01:12:37,399 --> 01:12:38,889
Let's go.
- No.

1183
01:12:38,968 --> 01:12:40,367
l won't go before a crowd.

1184
01:12:40,903 --> 01:12:42,803
You go and tell them l'm not here.

1185
01:12:42,972 --> 01:12:44,633
He's scared!

1186
01:12:45,941 --> 01:12:48,034
Where is he? Where is he?

1187
01:12:48,277 --> 01:12:49,710
Stop.

1188
01:12:49,812 --> 01:12:52,303
Bhoothnath is not here.
Please leave.

1189
01:12:52,848 --> 01:12:54,645
Bhoothnath..
- No one is in there.

1190
01:12:54,750 --> 01:12:57,810
Leave. Get going, aunty.
Komal is calling you. Go.

1191
01:12:57,887 --> 01:13:00,754
Scram. What? Leave.
Don't you all have work to do?

1192
01:13:00,823 --> 01:13:02,688
Scram. No one is in there. Leave.

1193
01:13:02,758 --> 01:13:05,921
Uncle, someone will steal
from your shop. Hurry up.

1194
01:13:10,065 --> 01:13:11,225
Please don't.

1195
01:13:12,301 --> 01:13:14,201
Give your support to this child.

1196
01:13:14,336 --> 01:13:16,099
Give him your blessings.

1197
01:13:16,705 --> 01:13:18,764
Long live..
- Bhau Sahib.

1198
01:13:18,841 --> 01:13:20,706
Long live..
- Bhau Sahib.

1199
01:13:20,776 --> 01:13:22,403
Long live..
- Bhau Sahib.

1200
01:13:22,945 --> 01:13:24,810
Long live..
- Bhau Sahib.

1201
01:13:24,947 --> 01:13:26,881
Long live..
- Bhau Sahib.

1202
01:13:27,116 --> 01:13:28,947
Long live..
- Bhau Sahib.

1203
01:13:29,018 --> 01:13:30,315
Long live..
- Bhau Sahib.

1204
01:13:30,719 --> 01:13:32,243
Long live..
- Bhau Sahib.

1205
01:13:32,321 --> 01:13:34,289
Long live..
- Bhau Sahib.

1206
01:13:34,423 --> 01:13:39,759
Ladies and gentleman, l have
a question for you. l want a reply.

1207
01:13:40,062 --> 01:13:43,225
This ghost who is
contesting the election..

1208
01:13:44,033 --> 01:13:46,501
..why is he fighting from our area?

1209
01:13:46,902 --> 01:13:48,267
Do you have an answer?

1210
01:13:48,370 --> 01:13:49,997
Do you? Do you?

1211
01:13:50,072 --> 01:13:51,471
You don't? You don't, right?

1212
01:13:51,740 --> 01:13:53,139
Let me tell you.

1213
01:13:53,375 --> 01:13:57,311
That's because through
our hard work and dedication..

1214
01:13:57,379 --> 01:14:00,439
..we have turned
this area into heaven.

1215
01:14:01,383 --> 01:14:04,250
Hey, stop it. What heaven?

1216
01:14:04,853 --> 01:14:07,981
That poor ghost got confused.

1217
01:14:08,324 --> 01:14:12,090
He thought, if there is
heaven on earth then it's here.

1218
01:14:12,161 --> 01:14:13,389
Applaud.

1219
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:22,762
As soon as he passed away,
he came here.

1220
01:14:23,839 --> 01:14:26,399
So all of you
shouldn't get confused.

1221
01:14:26,775 --> 01:14:28,208
Bhoothnath, do something.

1222
01:14:29,078 --> 01:14:31,410
lf the dialogues are a
hit then the movie will be a hit.

1223
01:14:35,484 --> 01:14:38,385
And if its songs are a hit
then the movie will be super-hit.

1224
01:14:38,821 --> 01:14:40,550
But who will write the song?

1225
01:14:42,958 --> 01:14:45,791
We'll need to find a writerwho..

1226
01:14:46,028 --> 01:14:49,794
..has same problems
with the system like we do.

1227
01:15:00,075 --> 01:15:02,839
We have a small request to make,
Mr. Anurag.

1228
01:15:03,045 --> 01:15:04,979
Sir, l don't make movies on ghosts.

1229
01:15:05,614 --> 01:15:09,141
No, l want you to
write a song for us.

1230
01:15:10,185 --> 01:15:11,675
An item song, sir?

1231
01:15:11,954 --> 01:15:13,683
An election number.

1232
01:15:14,790 --> 01:15:17,816
l don't think l have a choice, sir.

1233
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:21,327
No, l won't force you if you refuse.

1234
01:15:22,164 --> 01:15:26,157
But, you know that
it's for a very good cause.

1235
01:15:26,301 --> 01:15:28,826
Sir, l've a request to make.

1236
01:15:29,071 --> 01:15:30,902
You aren't visible.

1237
01:15:30,973 --> 01:15:32,235
And you walk while you talk..

1238
01:15:32,307 --> 01:15:34,707
..so it feels like you
are speaking in surround sound.

1239
01:15:34,810 --> 01:15:37,005
Anyways sir, we don't
have budgets for Dolby.

1240
01:15:37,046 --> 01:15:38,172
Here you go.

1241
01:15:39,848 --> 01:15:40,405
Better?

1242
01:15:41,016 --> 01:15:41,914
ls, he there?

1243
01:15:42,184 --> 01:15:44,277
Yes. Much better, sir.

1244
01:15:44,386 --> 01:15:46,718
l'll do it, sir.
- Thank you.

1245
01:15:47,089 --> 01:15:49,853
l've another request to make.

1246
01:15:49,958 --> 01:15:51,391
Sir, l cannot dance.

1247
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:54,354
ldiot, at least hear him out.

1248
01:15:55,197 --> 01:16:02,797
Look, your songs are
a little adult in nature.

1249
01:16:05,074 --> 01:16:07,008
l got it, sir.

1250
01:16:08,177 --> 01:16:10,407
lt will be difficult,
but l'll do it.

1251
01:16:10,679 --> 01:16:15,343
Songs will be for adults
but they won't be only for adults.

1252
01:16:15,751 --> 01:16:17,378
l promise, sir.
- Thank you.

1253
01:16:18,854 --> 01:16:19,946
Come on.

1254
01:16:22,324 --> 01:16:24,758
You made him win
through a big margin.

1255
01:16:24,827 --> 01:16:28,695
Ladies and gentlemen,
the pride of your area..

1256
01:16:28,864 --> 01:16:32,265
Hard working, dedicated Bhau Sahib!

1257
01:16:33,102 --> 01:16:34,831
Our song is ready?

1258
01:16:36,004 --> 01:16:37,972
Then play it.

1259
01:16:41,343 --> 01:16:46,246
'And here comes a message
dedicated by the public..'

1260
01:16:46,415 --> 01:16:53,821
'..to Dharavi legislative assembly's
deceitful, corrupt dishonest..'

1261
01:16:54,056 --> 01:16:55,887
'..Bhau Sahib.'

1262
01:17:24,286 --> 01:17:27,221
''Keep your arrogance to yourself,
forthe best.''

1263
01:17:27,789 --> 01:17:29,848
''This order is issued
in public interest.''

1264
01:17:31,193 --> 01:17:32,751
''Better stay within
your limits.''

1265
01:17:32,895 --> 01:17:34,157
''Hello, hello.''

1266
01:17:34,763 --> 01:17:36,856
''Now, it's ourturn.''

1267
01:17:37,766 --> 01:17:39,631
''A little bit of whip.''

1268
01:17:39,701 --> 01:17:41,362
''Whoeverwas given, was fixed.''

1269
01:17:41,637 --> 01:17:45,767
''Our craziness is gaining fame.''

1270
01:17:46,842 --> 01:17:49,106
''A party..''

1271
01:17:49,311 --> 01:17:50,369
''Forthis reason..''

1272
01:17:50,646 --> 01:17:52,204
''A party is a must.''

1273
01:17:53,682 --> 01:17:55,411
''A party is a must.''

1274
01:17:57,186 --> 01:17:59,154
''A party is a must.''

1275
01:18:00,889 --> 01:18:02,823
''A party is a must.''

1276
01:18:16,672 --> 01:18:18,264
''Our party continues.''

1277
01:18:23,278 --> 01:18:25,075
''lt's now our responsibility.''

1278
01:18:30,219 --> 01:18:32,210
''Our party continues.''

1279
01:18:37,092 --> 01:18:39,083
''lt's now our responsibility.''

1280
01:18:39,127 --> 01:18:40,458
''l am a king.''

1281
01:18:40,829 --> 01:18:42,456
''Who can match up with me?''

1282
01:18:42,731 --> 01:18:46,064
''lt's God, who is my backbone.''

1283
01:18:46,168 --> 01:18:47,760
''Making everyone
dance to ourtunes..''

1284
01:18:47,869 --> 01:18:49,336
''We have stolen the show.''

1285
01:18:49,738 --> 01:18:52,901
''All the ladies and gentlemen,
get ready and come for some more.''

1286
01:18:52,975 --> 01:18:56,877
''We are so happy that
we are acting crazy.''

1287
01:18:58,347 --> 01:19:00,872
''A party..''

1288
01:19:00,949 --> 01:19:01,813
''Forthis reason..''

1289
01:19:01,950 --> 01:19:03,713
''A party is a must.''

1290
01:19:05,053 --> 01:19:07,112
''A party is a must.''

1291
01:19:08,924 --> 01:19:10,448
''A party is a must.''

1292
01:19:12,261 --> 01:19:14,126
''A party is a must.''

1293
01:19:15,931 --> 01:19:19,059
''Unstoppable, is our level.''

1294
01:19:19,134 --> 01:19:22,831
''Everything's done out in the
open, nothing underthe table.''

1295
01:19:22,971 --> 01:19:24,131
''You are devil's friend.''

1296
01:19:24,172 --> 01:19:25,935
''You should be banned.''

1297
01:19:26,141 --> 01:19:29,338
''Words don't affect you,
you should be hanged.''

1298
01:19:29,478 --> 01:19:32,970
''Oh, your horrific scams,
yourtime's up, man.''

1299
01:19:33,148 --> 01:19:36,481
''l have more guts than you,
come l'll clear all your doubts.''

1300
01:19:36,752 --> 01:19:40,051
''Now you will be exposed, your
honourwill go down the gutter hole.

1301
01:19:40,289 --> 01:19:43,747
''You won't be able to show
yourface afterthe exit-poles.''

1302
01:19:48,897 --> 01:19:50,524
''Our party continues.''

1303
01:19:55,804 --> 01:19:57,772
''lt's now our responsibility.''

1304
01:19:57,906 --> 01:19:59,806
''A party is a must.''

1305
01:20:01,009 --> 01:20:02,943
''A party is a must.''

1306
01:20:14,589 --> 01:20:16,557
So, did you enjoy that?

1307
01:20:16,625 --> 01:20:20,288
l've never danced at someone wedding
as much as l did at Bhau's funeral.

1308
01:20:22,664 --> 01:20:24,757
Bhau won't take it lying down.

1309
01:20:26,601 --> 01:20:27,829
Let's see what he does.

1310
01:20:30,172 --> 01:20:32,834
Media is waiting outside. Hurry up.

1311
01:20:32,974 --> 01:20:35,704
President, why do you worry?

1312
01:20:35,877 --> 01:20:37,845
Just because a crazy ghost says
that l am a thief then..

1313
01:20:37,913 --> 01:20:39,574
..that doesn't make me a thief.

1314
01:20:40,248 --> 01:20:42,978
Last year some obscene
accusations were made against you.

1315
01:20:43,251 --> 01:20:45,879
That doesn't mean you
were involved in it, right?

1316
01:20:46,321 --> 01:20:47,652
No, right?

1317
01:20:48,190 --> 01:20:50,124
Hearsay cannot kill anyone.

1318
01:20:50,258 --> 01:20:53,022
That's fine. But what
do we tell the high command?

1319
01:20:53,228 --> 01:20:54,627
And the people?

1320
01:20:55,597 --> 01:21:00,227
Ask the high command to worry
about other seats in the country.

1321
01:21:00,702 --> 01:21:02,602
And as far as the
people are concerned..

1322
01:21:02,671 --> 01:21:04,866
They will come,
applaud and then forget.

1323
01:21:05,574 --> 01:21:09,135
Sir, an election
is just like a circus.

1324
01:21:09,244 --> 01:21:11,940
Jokers are only there to pass time.

1325
01:21:12,047 --> 01:21:14,982
Tickets are bought
to watch the lion.

1326
01:21:15,751 --> 01:21:18,652
Don't worry.
Be rest assured. Let's go.

1327
01:21:21,056 --> 01:21:23,251
Sir.. Just one question, please.

1328
01:21:23,325 --> 01:21:24,986
Sir! Sir! Sir!
- Just one question.

1329
01:21:27,162 --> 01:21:30,563
What would you like to say regarding
the accusations about your scams?

1330
01:21:30,866 --> 01:21:34,302
Look, Mr. Bhoothnath has
made these accusations on me.

1331
01:21:34,903 --> 01:21:36,666
Now Mr. Bhoothnath..

1332
01:21:37,005 --> 01:21:38,597
Excuse me..

1333
01:21:41,710 --> 01:21:42,938
Now Mr. Bhoothnath..

1334
01:21:42,978 --> 01:21:44,104
What happened, Bhau?

1335
01:21:44,813 --> 01:21:46,041
Mr. Bhoothnath..

1336
01:21:48,750 --> 01:21:50,945
Mr. Bhoothnath.. Stop tickling me.

1337
01:21:51,686 --> 01:21:53,950
What?! What is he doing?

1338
01:21:54,256 --> 01:21:56,622
Bloody con man.

1339
01:21:56,858 --> 01:21:58,792
Bhoothnath! Bhoothnath!

1340
01:21:59,127 --> 01:22:00,856
Don't slap me.

1341
01:22:02,697 --> 01:22:05,222
Can you see that?
He is misusing his powers!

1342
01:22:05,300 --> 01:22:06,927
You are kicking me!

1343
01:22:07,002 --> 01:22:08,367
Mr. Bhoothnath!
Mr. Bhoothnath! What are you doing?

1344
01:22:08,637 --> 01:22:09,865
You are kicking me!

1345
01:22:10,839 --> 01:22:12,067
This is..

1346
01:22:12,707 --> 01:22:16,165
No! No! No!
Don't do that again. Enough. Enough!

1347
01:22:25,654 --> 01:22:27,781
Mr. Bhoothnath is doing this,
not me.

1348
01:22:30,692 --> 01:22:32,353
Mr. Bhoothnath! Mr. Bhoothnath!

1349
01:22:34,963 --> 01:22:36,225
Bhau, please. Please.

1350
01:22:37,732 --> 01:22:39,324
Hold the hands.
Hold them tight.

1351
01:22:39,768 --> 01:22:41,793
Enough.
Enough. Bhau, please. Enough.

1352
01:22:42,070 --> 01:22:46,302
As you can see how Mr. Bhootnath
is misusing his powers?

1353
01:22:49,110 --> 01:22:51,237
No, Mr. Bhootnath. No!

1354
01:22:53,215 --> 01:22:55,012
He's playing dirty.

1355
01:22:56,618 --> 01:22:59,348
Who saw the peacock
dance in the forest?

1356
01:22:59,888 --> 01:23:01,014
What do you mean?

1357
01:23:02,824 --> 01:23:04,155
You just wait and watch.

1358
01:23:04,993 --> 01:23:06,756
l just don't understand, sir.

1359
01:23:06,928 --> 01:23:10,694
l had pressed record,
but nothing got recorded.

1360
01:23:12,033 --> 01:23:14,968
l got good shots, sir.
l don't know what happened to them.

1361
01:23:15,237 --> 01:23:18,900
What's this?
Where's the footage?

1362
01:23:19,341 --> 01:23:22,777
Watch how a dog bravely
fought a panther.

1363
01:23:22,911 --> 01:23:26,347
lt's the same pantherwho has been
troubling people since the past one month...

1364
01:23:26,414 --> 01:23:29,781
To seek revenge for his girlfriend
her boyfriend married her mother.

1365
01:23:29,851 --> 01:23:31,079
And the girl's family..

1366
01:23:31,152 --> 01:23:34,883
To protest inflation people
protested by carrying empty bags.

1367
01:23:35,023 --> 01:23:36,854
And here's the weatherforecast..

1368
01:23:37,125 --> 01:23:37,989
Lallan!

1369
01:23:38,059 --> 01:23:41,051
Bhau!
- Why aren't we on the news?

1370
01:23:41,096 --> 01:23:42,757
l'll find out.

1371
01:23:43,064 --> 01:23:45,055
Call the news channel.
- Okay, Bhau.

1372
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:47,259
What happened, Bhau?
- Who is it?

1373
01:23:48,904 --> 01:23:53,102
l heard someone made all
your hard work go down the drain.

1374
01:23:53,275 --> 01:23:54,401
Who is it?

1375
01:23:54,676 --> 01:23:58,942
The one who hit you,
beat you.

1376
01:23:59,347 --> 01:24:01,042
Thrashed you.

1377
01:24:02,384 --> 01:24:03,783
At least hear me out.

1378
01:24:03,852 --> 01:24:05,911
Just shut up and listen!

1379
01:24:06,087 --> 01:24:08,988
lf l want l can make
you shut shop in no time.

1380
01:24:09,124 --> 01:24:11,058
But l am not like you.

1381
01:24:11,159 --> 01:24:14,424
Today you accused me of doing
something that l haven't done.

1382
01:24:14,829 --> 01:24:19,892
Now l will do something
that you have nevertried to do.

1383
01:24:21,403 --> 01:24:22,927
Not in my ears!

1384
01:24:23,238 --> 01:24:24,830
Keep watching the news.

1385
01:24:29,911 --> 01:24:31,139
Lallan!

1386
01:24:31,379 --> 01:24:33,006
Then l sprayed water...

1387
01:24:35,951 --> 01:24:38,010
You've so proudly said
so many things.. - Yes.

1388
01:24:38,186 --> 01:24:41,246
But now the garbage,
the pothole, water problems..

1389
01:24:41,523 --> 01:24:44,014
..you will find a solution forthem?

1390
01:24:46,828 --> 01:24:48,295
l can do that.

1391
01:24:50,498 --> 01:24:52,295
But that won't be right.

1392
01:24:53,001 --> 01:24:54,195
No.

1393
01:24:56,237 --> 01:24:57,465
lt won't be right.

1394
01:25:00,342 --> 01:25:02,139
lt'll be right..

1395
01:25:03,878 --> 01:25:08,144
..when the one who is being
paid to clean the garbage cleans it.

1396
01:25:10,185 --> 01:25:13,552
Potholes are filled
by those appointed to do it.

1397
01:25:14,222 --> 01:25:16,213
Those who are responsible to get..

1398
01:25:17,392 --> 01:25:20,327
..the waterto the tap,
fulfill their responsibility.

1399
01:25:23,031 --> 01:25:25,226
Whetherthey do it willingly..

1400
01:25:26,368 --> 01:25:27,835
.. or out of fear.

1401
01:25:39,147 --> 01:25:41,809
lt's your department's
duty to clearthe garbage.

1402
01:25:41,883 --> 01:25:42,941
Yes.

1403
01:25:43,118 --> 01:25:48,055
Henceforth, if the garbage is not
cleared, it'll end up in your house.

1404
01:25:48,189 --> 01:25:49,121
No.

1405
01:25:49,190 --> 01:25:51,090
You'll keep your house clean,
won't you?

1406
01:25:51,259 --> 01:25:52,658
Yes.

1407
01:25:52,794 --> 01:25:54,056
Remember..

1408
01:25:55,030 --> 01:25:58,363
..you can't just fill the
potholes of my constituency.

1409
01:25:58,433 --> 01:25:59,365
Yes, sir.

1410
01:25:59,434 --> 01:26:02,062
And it's not enough that
you just fill the potholes..

1411
01:26:02,103 --> 01:26:03,127
No, sir.

1412
01:26:03,271 --> 01:26:06,729
Once the potholes are filled it would
be better if they remain that way.

1413
01:26:07,242 --> 01:26:08,209
Right!

1414
01:26:08,276 --> 01:26:09,402
Yes, sir.

1415
01:26:18,186 --> 01:26:21,713
lf you have understood the pain
of suddenly not having water..

1416
01:26:21,890 --> 01:26:24,051
..then let's get back to work.

1417
01:26:38,339 --> 01:26:40,705
Look. Look. Look.

1418
01:26:40,909 --> 01:26:42,843
Good Dharavi.

1419
01:26:42,977 --> 01:26:44,842
Clean Dharavi.

1420
01:26:44,979 --> 01:26:47,470
Good Dharavi. Clean Dharavi.

1421
01:26:47,949 --> 01:26:49,075
Bad photo. Sorry.

1422
01:26:49,150 --> 01:26:50,208
Slumdog?

1423
01:26:50,318 --> 01:26:52,445
No Slumdog, only bulldog.

1424
01:26:52,721 --> 01:26:53,312
Bulldog.

1425
01:26:53,388 --> 01:26:54,355
Bulldog.

1426
01:26:54,422 --> 01:26:56,913
lt feels like there's still
some hope left in this world.

1427
01:26:56,991 --> 01:26:59,926
l think all the politicians
should be like Bhoothnath.

1428
01:27:01,830 --> 01:27:03,457
Bhoothnath did what he promised.

1429
01:27:03,732 --> 01:27:04,756
Has anyone else done so?

1430
01:27:04,833 --> 01:27:08,462
lf such a good job continues
then it won't hurt to pay taxes.

1431
01:27:10,171 --> 01:27:11,900
They even cleaned our area.

1432
01:27:11,973 --> 01:27:14,134
lt feels good to know that
someone thinks about us as well.

1433
01:27:14,309 --> 01:27:17,142
While Bhau only talks,
Bhoothnath does.

1434
01:27:18,146 --> 01:27:20,273
You made so many promises!
You don't do anything.

1435
01:27:20,348 --> 01:27:22,248
l am... - That Bhoothnath
does everything.

1436
01:27:22,317 --> 01:27:23,284
Get lost!

1437
01:27:23,351 --> 01:27:25,251
Bhau, people's point
of view is changing.

1438
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:27,151
Then we will change
their point of view.

1439
01:27:29,691 --> 01:27:31,056
Potholes are being filled.

1440
01:27:31,159 --> 01:27:33,923
Garbage is being cleared.
There is water in the taps.

1441
01:27:33,995 --> 01:27:36,293
And the poor are getting
what is rightfully theirs.

1442
01:27:36,364 --> 01:27:39,265
And this miracle has been
performed by Mr. Bhoothnath.

1443
01:27:39,400 --> 01:27:42,631
Look, please don't
address something that..

1444
01:27:42,704 --> 01:27:44,365
..should be done
everyday as a miracle.

1445
01:27:51,179 --> 01:27:54,046
l would like to congratulate
Mr. Bhoothnath.

1446
01:27:55,049 --> 01:27:56,914
Whatever he has done..

1447
01:27:57,719 --> 01:27:59,812
..it cannot be done
by a human being.

1448
01:28:00,688 --> 01:28:03,088
And being an ordinary human being..

1449
01:28:03,825 --> 01:28:07,090
..l am withdrawing my
nominations from this election.

1450
01:28:07,162 --> 01:28:08,891
Mr. Bhoothnath, you win.

1451
01:28:08,963 --> 01:28:11,124
Hearty congratulations to you.

1452
01:28:13,001 --> 01:28:14,059
But sir..

1453
01:28:14,369 --> 01:28:17,429
Look, it's no use
fighting elections..

1454
01:28:17,739 --> 01:28:19,172
.. where you are bound to lose.

1455
01:28:20,675 --> 01:28:23,940
Mr. Bhoothnath will use his
divine powers and won't let me win.

1456
01:28:24,078 --> 01:28:25,238
What are you trying to say?

1457
01:28:26,681 --> 01:28:28,273
People will vote for me.

1458
01:28:28,383 --> 01:28:29,782
l know that.

1459
01:28:30,785 --> 01:28:33,447
But l don't know
where this vote will go.

1460
01:28:34,255 --> 01:28:37,315
We have been escaping
booth capturing since so long.

1461
01:28:38,059 --> 01:28:40,823
But who will save us from
Bhooth-capturing? (Ghost-capturing)

1462
01:28:41,062 --> 01:28:44,088
Bhau, if you would've used even..

1463
01:28:44,265 --> 01:28:46,733
..as little as 10%
of your gift of gab..

1464
01:28:46,835 --> 01:28:49,998
..and turn it into action
then l wouldn't have to do your job.

1465
01:28:50,071 --> 01:28:54,007
lf l didn't fearthe law
l too would've acted like a goon.

1466
01:28:54,075 --> 01:28:55,269
What act of hooliganism have l done?

1467
01:28:55,343 --> 01:28:57,004
What did you do with those officers?

1468
01:28:57,078 --> 01:28:58,739
l did what you should've done.

1469
01:28:58,813 --> 01:29:01,043
l don't threaten the
officers to get the job done.

1470
01:29:01,115 --> 01:29:02,844
l stay within the
constitution and do my job.

1471
01:29:02,917 --> 01:29:05,750
Bhau, the truth is
that you don't do your job.

1472
01:29:06,087 --> 01:29:08,180
Water, garbage, potholes..

1473
01:29:08,790 --> 01:29:10,883
..these are some of
the very basic issues.

1474
01:29:11,326 --> 01:29:14,022
Have you ever done any infrastructure
development in your area?

1475
01:29:14,162 --> 01:29:15,424
Have you started schools for kids?

1476
01:29:15,730 --> 01:29:17,459
Made jobs available for youth?

1477
01:29:18,132 --> 01:29:20,498
What have you done
to control corruption?

1478
01:29:21,102 --> 01:29:22,501
How safe are the
women on the streets?

1479
01:29:22,770 --> 01:29:24,328
You are changing the topic.

1480
01:29:24,472 --> 01:29:26,770
The fact is that
you misused your powers.

1481
01:29:26,841 --> 01:29:29,002
lf l have misused it then l've done
so forthe betterment of the people.

1482
01:29:29,077 --> 01:29:31,807
lf tomorrow you decide to misuse
your powers for your own good,

1483
01:29:31,913 --> 01:29:33,210
then what will anyone be able to do?

1484
01:29:33,314 --> 01:29:35,145
Why would l do that?
- Why would you do that?

1485
01:29:35,183 --> 01:29:37,378
You've already done that.
And you can still do it.

1486
01:29:37,852 --> 01:29:41,219
ln the future if people go against you,
will you tape their mouths as well?

1487
01:29:41,289 --> 01:29:42,256
What rubbish is this?

1488
01:29:42,323 --> 01:29:44,154
''What rubbish!'' lt's a fact!

1489
01:29:44,325 --> 01:29:46,350
Who can stop you from becoming
Hitlerwhile you possess such powers

1490
01:29:46,461 --> 01:29:48,019
Look Bhau Sahib,
now you are changing the topic.

1491
01:29:48,096 --> 01:29:50,291
No, no, no.
l am not changing the topic.

1492
01:29:50,398 --> 01:29:51,922
l am coming to the topic.

1493
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,059
lf you really want
to help the people..

1494
01:29:54,135 --> 01:29:56,228
..then do so with the power
given to you by the people.

1495
01:29:56,304 --> 01:29:57,771
And not with your ghostly powers.

1496
01:29:57,839 --> 01:30:01,002
So that you too have the
fear of losing your position.

1497
01:30:02,176 --> 01:30:03,040
Do you have the courage?

1498
01:30:03,111 --> 01:30:06,103
lf so then let go of your powers
and then let's fight as equals.

1499
01:30:06,180 --> 01:30:08,546
Otherwise,
stop pretending to help people.

1500
01:30:09,017 --> 01:30:10,177
Can you let go of it?

1501
01:30:10,218 --> 01:30:12,379
Can you let go of your power?

1502
01:30:13,388 --> 01:30:14,514
You can't, right?

1503
01:30:16,791 --> 01:30:18,190
Then it's decided.

1504
01:30:26,200 --> 01:30:30,193
Bhau Sahib, you don't need to
take your nomination papers back.

1505
01:30:30,838 --> 01:30:34,535
l forfeit my powers right away.

1506
01:31:00,635 --> 01:31:01,795
Mr. Bhoothnath?

1507
01:31:02,070 --> 01:31:03,037
He's gone.

1508
01:31:11,279 --> 01:31:14,771
Bhau played you,
and you easily got played.

1509
01:31:15,650 --> 01:31:17,811
Did you leave your brains up there?

1510
01:31:20,722 --> 01:31:24,021
People fight for power,
you forfeited your powerto fight!

1511
01:31:24,726 --> 01:31:27,627
You are 60 years old
but behave like a 7 year old.

1512
01:31:31,933 --> 01:31:34,800
ln spite of doing everything right..

1513
01:31:36,738 --> 01:31:40,037
..when people would
question our victory..

1514
01:31:42,243 --> 01:31:44,040
..would you like that?

1515
01:31:47,148 --> 01:31:48,274
You won't, right?

1516
01:31:50,284 --> 01:31:53,117
Yes, but it has reduced
our chances of victory.

1517
01:31:54,122 --> 01:31:56,090
Chances have been reduced..

1518
01:31:57,258 --> 01:31:59,158
..they are not over.

1519
01:32:02,030 --> 01:32:04,055
Put your seat belt on.

1520
01:32:05,066 --> 01:32:07,296
The road ahead is bumpy.

1521
01:32:08,436 --> 01:32:10,666
You were great, Bhau.

1522
01:32:11,706 --> 01:32:15,142
You have ruined
Bhoothnath's future..

1523
01:32:15,676 --> 01:32:17,439
.. by making him forfeit his powers.

1524
01:32:19,347 --> 01:32:20,405
What will he do now?

1525
01:32:21,082 --> 01:32:22,413
He is done for.

1526
01:32:22,683 --> 01:32:24,310
Bhau..
- Mr. kriplani is here.

1527
01:32:25,186 --> 01:32:26,813
Shall l send him in?

1528
01:32:31,092 --> 01:32:32,855
Mr. kriplani..

1529
01:32:33,361 --> 01:32:34,953
Will you have something?

1530
01:32:35,063 --> 01:32:36,087
No?

1531
01:32:38,199 --> 01:32:41,430
What's all this happening
under your rein, Mr. kriplani?

1532
01:32:42,804 --> 01:32:44,396
You are the one who is reining.

1533
01:32:44,939 --> 01:32:47,032
l just play with the law.

1534
01:32:47,108 --> 01:32:52,011
Then make such a move that
the game gets over by halftime.

1535
01:32:53,881 --> 01:32:55,212
lt will be done.

1536
01:32:59,454 --> 01:33:00,978
Will you have something?

1537
01:33:01,889 --> 01:33:03,982
No? lt's okay.

1538
01:33:07,295 --> 01:33:08,455
My nomination has been challenged?

1539
01:33:08,529 --> 01:33:09,496
Yes, sir.

1540
01:33:09,630 --> 01:33:12,360
Bhau has challenged my nomination?
On what basis?

1541
01:33:12,467 --> 01:33:14,264
Sir, as perthe rule..

1542
01:33:14,435 --> 01:33:18,337
..the person contesting the
election should also be a voter.

1543
01:33:18,506 --> 01:33:20,906
And his lawyer has
sent an objection letter..

1544
01:33:21,008 --> 01:33:24,068
..stating that a dead
person can't be a voter.

1545
01:33:27,415 --> 01:33:28,643
Sorry, sir.

1546
01:33:29,584 --> 01:33:30,983
lt is totally my fault.

1547
01:33:31,052 --> 01:33:34,613
This is the only point l missed.

1548
01:33:36,390 --> 01:33:38,290
Can we do something?

1549
01:33:38,893 --> 01:33:41,487
Sir, l can't think
of a way out of it.

1550
01:33:44,966 --> 01:33:46,934
lt is a valid objection.

1551
01:33:48,136 --> 01:33:49,467
Sorry.

1552
01:34:09,657 --> 01:34:12,091
Slowly becoming popular
with the people,

1553
01:34:12,160 --> 01:34:16,460
Bhoothnath's election nomination
is now facing a question mark.

1554
01:34:29,810 --> 01:34:31,243
Excuse me.

1555
01:34:32,747 --> 01:34:34,078
ls Mr. Bhoothnath here?

1556
01:34:34,182 --> 01:34:37,117
Later, boss. lt's not a good time.

1557
01:34:37,451 --> 01:34:38,748
Hey..

1558
01:34:39,253 --> 01:34:41,414
..l had told you about Banku, right?

1559
01:34:43,057 --> 01:34:44,684
He is Banku's father.

1560
01:34:46,093 --> 01:34:47,253
Sir..

1561
01:34:48,329 --> 01:34:50,820
..l heard about you on TV.

1562
01:34:51,065 --> 01:34:53,795
l had some information.
l thought l should tell you.

1563
01:34:54,035 --> 01:34:55,935
lt perhaps might help you.

1564
01:34:56,837 --> 01:34:58,828
lnformation?
What kind of information?

1565
01:34:58,973 --> 01:35:03,342
Sir, your death certificate
has still not been issued.

1566
01:35:04,312 --> 01:35:06,177
My death certificate
hasn't been issued?

1567
01:35:07,481 --> 01:35:08,778
Why?

1568
01:35:10,117 --> 01:35:13,450
Because your son
refused to give bribe.

1569
01:35:18,192 --> 01:35:20,717
And one more thing, sir.

1570
01:35:23,231 --> 01:35:25,927
We're very proud of you, sir.

1571
01:35:26,133 --> 01:35:27,259
Thank you, sir.

1572
01:35:27,335 --> 01:35:28,734
Thank you.

1573
01:35:38,079 --> 01:35:39,011
kriplani..

1574
01:35:39,080 --> 01:35:40,104
Bhau...

1575
01:35:45,720 --> 01:35:50,817
l always had a desire to see
someone's nomination get disqualified.

1576
01:35:52,059 --> 01:35:53,959
ls Mr. Bhoothnath here?

1577
01:35:54,829 --> 01:35:55,761
Mr. Bhoothnath?

1578
01:35:55,830 --> 01:35:57,058
Mr. Bhoothnath?

1579
01:35:57,732 --> 01:36:00,064
Thank you fortelling me. Otherwise
l would've ended up on his lap.

1580
01:36:02,169 --> 01:36:03,932
Hello, Mr. Bhoothnath.

1581
01:36:06,240 --> 01:36:07,867
l think he is upset with me.

1582
01:36:08,409 --> 01:36:09,842
Okay, let's start.

1583
01:36:12,213 --> 01:36:15,910
Sir, l always thought
good wins over bad.

1584
01:36:16,017 --> 01:36:17,109
But l was wrong.

1585
01:36:18,452 --> 01:36:21,421
Sometimes something bad
can end up stopping something bad.

1586
01:36:22,923 --> 01:36:28,327
Look, as my son didn't
pay underthe table..

1587
01:36:28,996 --> 01:36:35,026
..a corrupt officer didn't
issue my death certificate.

1588
01:36:35,703 --> 01:36:37,000
As my death certificate
wasn't issued..

1589
01:36:37,071 --> 01:36:39,232
..my name wasn't cancelled
from the voting list.

1590
01:36:39,707 --> 01:36:41,072
As my name wasn't cancelled..

1591
01:36:41,108 --> 01:36:43,133
..you will be
surprised to hearthis.

1592
01:36:43,277 --> 01:36:47,373
Some minister made someone
vote for me during last elections.

1593
01:36:48,115 --> 01:36:49,844
Lawyer?
- Yes.

1594
01:36:51,152 --> 01:36:53,347
These are some documents
from the election office.

1595
01:36:53,821 --> 01:36:56,187
My name is in the voting list.

1596
01:36:56,357 --> 01:37:02,353
And as perthe record,
l voted in the last election.

1597
01:37:02,830 --> 01:37:03,956
From Madgaon.

1598
01:37:05,132 --> 01:37:06,121
Now tell me..

1599
01:37:06,500 --> 01:37:11,767
..thanks to a corrupt officer
and a deceitful minister..

1600
01:37:12,006 --> 01:37:16,409
..an honest candidate like me
was saved from being disqualified.

1601
01:37:17,378 --> 01:37:21,940
Sometimes something bad
can end up doing something good.

1602
01:37:25,686 --> 01:37:27,153
Would you like to say something?

1603
01:37:27,355 --> 01:37:31,052
Sir, everyone knows that he is dead.

1604
01:37:31,425 --> 01:37:33,052
And that he cannot vote.

1605
01:37:33,127 --> 01:37:37,086
But that cannot be proved
because he is misusing the rules.

1606
01:37:37,431 --> 01:37:41,162
And on that basis he
should be disqualified.

1607
01:37:41,302 --> 01:37:44,829
Sir, everyone knows that
he is accused of..

1608
01:37:44,972 --> 01:37:48,339
..a number of corruption, murder,
tax, frauds, and malpractices.

1609
01:37:48,676 --> 01:37:51,770
But those accusations
couldn't be proved because..

1610
01:37:51,879 --> 01:37:53,904
..he also misused the rules.

1611
01:37:54,048 --> 01:37:55,709
So according to that..
On that ba..

1612
01:37:55,783 --> 01:37:57,842
On that basis..

1613
01:37:58,452 --> 01:38:00,886
He too should be disqualified.

1614
01:38:04,859 --> 01:38:06,417
What happened, Bhau Sahib?

1615
01:38:08,129 --> 01:38:10,393
l think he is upset.

1616
01:38:12,099 --> 01:38:13,259
Sir..

1617
01:38:14,068 --> 01:38:15,467
Jai Hind.
(Hail Motherland)

1618
01:38:26,080 --> 01:38:28,071
Our election office.

1619
01:38:30,951 --> 01:38:33,044
This was my father's garage.

1620
01:38:35,956 --> 01:38:38,754
Let me introduce you to some people.

1621
01:38:44,165 --> 01:38:46,133
Our party workers.

1622
01:38:46,467 --> 01:38:49,334
Come in. Don't get scared.
He's a nice ghost.

1623
01:38:49,770 --> 01:38:51,328
He is fighting for ourfuture.

1624
01:38:53,240 --> 01:38:54,002
Say..

1625
01:38:54,074 --> 01:38:57,009
He will win! He will win!
- Bhoothnath will win!

1626
01:38:57,111 --> 01:39:01,172
He will win! He will win!
- Bhoothnath will win!

1627
01:39:04,985 --> 01:39:06,509
Why don't you vote?

1628
01:39:07,421 --> 01:39:10,015
Because all the
ministers are the same.

1629
01:39:10,324 --> 01:39:13,782
Whether it's you or Bhau.
What difference does it make?

1630
01:39:15,863 --> 01:39:18,127
l am more honest than Bhau.

1631
01:39:18,365 --> 01:39:21,801
He becomes invisible
after getting votes.

1632
01:39:23,804 --> 01:39:25,431
l'm already invisible.

1633
01:39:27,942 --> 01:39:29,136
Where is Mr. Bhootnath?

1634
01:39:29,810 --> 01:39:31,038
Over here.

1635
01:39:31,178 --> 01:39:34,375
Opposition party's
leaderwants to meet you.

1636
01:39:39,753 --> 01:39:42,722
So you want me to join your party.

1637
01:39:44,058 --> 01:39:48,757
Why didn't your party make
a candidate stand against Bhau?

1638
01:39:48,863 --> 01:39:52,299
The thing is,
we didn't have a candidate like you.

1639
01:39:52,867 --> 01:39:57,895
And anyways, our party
never bets on a losing horse.

1640
01:39:58,873 --> 01:40:00,033
Tell me something..

1641
01:40:00,708 --> 01:40:01,970
..do you have any idea..

1642
01:40:02,042 --> 01:40:06,138
..how much money orworkforce
is required forthis election?

1643
01:40:06,480 --> 01:40:07,811
No, sir.

1644
01:40:09,083 --> 01:40:12,951
l don't know how much black money
is required to win an election.

1645
01:40:13,020 --> 01:40:15,250
Or how many goons are required.

1646
01:40:15,356 --> 01:40:19,019
Okay. Fine. So,
do you know how many Hindus and..

1647
01:40:19,093 --> 01:40:20,822
.. Muslims there are in your area?

1648
01:40:21,028 --> 01:40:23,121
How many are from
the backward class?

1649
01:40:23,264 --> 01:40:26,165
The thing is,
it is necessary to know that much..

1650
01:40:26,333 --> 01:40:29,325
..to manipulate votes, boss.

1651
01:40:29,503 --> 01:40:32,063
No. l don't know that as well.

1652
01:40:32,239 --> 01:40:36,767
All l know is that my constituency
consists of 100% lndians.

1653
01:40:36,944 --> 01:40:39,777
Sir, throw your
principles in the dustbin.

1654
01:40:40,014 --> 01:40:43,450
Okay. Fine.
l'm throwing them in the dustbin.

1655
01:40:44,251 --> 01:40:48,449
Now tell me,
how should we manipulate votes?

1656
01:40:48,756 --> 01:40:51,054
That depends on the
marketing strategy.

1657
01:40:51,125 --> 01:40:52,888
Marketing strategy?
- Yes.

1658
01:40:52,960 --> 01:40:54,120
All the parties do it.

1659
01:40:54,161 --> 01:40:57,028
Assume that there are two
detergent companies in the market.

1660
01:40:57,097 --> 01:41:00,533
And both of them claim that
they provide the best whiteness.

1661
01:41:00,935 --> 01:41:02,800
So which one will the public choose?

1662
01:41:02,937 --> 01:41:06,873
They will choose the
one whose marketing they like.

1663
01:41:06,941 --> 01:41:09,034
Okay! Okay! Okay!

1664
01:41:09,777 --> 01:41:12,245
There's another benefit in politics.

1665
01:41:13,180 --> 01:41:19,380
After buying the detergent even if it
doesn't fulfill the promise it made..

1666
01:41:19,853 --> 01:41:23,186
..they have to make do with it forfive years.
- Yes.

1667
01:41:23,424 --> 01:41:27,793
And afterfive years,
you can launch a new detergent.

1668
01:41:28,963 --> 01:41:33,559
Or re-launch the old detergent.
Like Bhau,

1669
01:41:34,201 --> 01:41:36,169
with a new formula,

1670
01:41:36,904 --> 01:41:39,099
for more whiteness. Right?

1671
01:41:39,173 --> 01:41:40,538
Wonderful.

1672
01:41:41,308 --> 01:41:42,468
Wonderful.

1673
01:41:42,543 --> 01:41:45,068
You've passed with distinction.

1674
01:41:45,412 --> 01:41:48,040
So you think that
l can win this election?

1675
01:41:48,182 --> 01:41:51,413
You will win this election
only if you fight it the way..

1676
01:41:51,485 --> 01:41:53,885
..it is fought in our country.

1677
01:41:54,188 --> 01:41:56,213
The thing is, if honest
people could win elections..

1678
01:41:56,290 --> 01:41:58,224
..just by contesting for it..

1679
01:41:58,292 --> 01:42:02,228
..then people like us would've
become unemployed long back.

1680
01:42:05,633 --> 01:42:07,294
This is the truth, Mr. Bhoothnath.

1681
01:42:08,035 --> 01:42:11,937
The thing is,
everyone will come to cheer you up.

1682
01:42:12,206 --> 01:42:14,834
But not everyone will come to vote.

1683
01:42:15,943 --> 01:42:17,774
This is what has been happening.

1684
01:42:17,911 --> 01:42:19,776
And this is what
will continue to happen.

1685
01:42:23,751 --> 01:42:25,810
These people make
such a fool of everyone..

1686
01:42:26,754 --> 01:42:28,688
..during elections.

1687
01:42:28,922 --> 01:42:30,184
Ask him, will he continue
to talk to himself..

1688
01:42:30,290 --> 01:42:32,315
..or does he wish to tell
us something?

1689
01:42:33,193 --> 01:42:35,718
Will you tell us what happened?

1690
01:42:36,997 --> 01:42:40,023
You know why a good
candidate doesn't win?

1691
01:42:41,035 --> 01:42:42,764
Let me tell you.
Give me some groundnuts.

1692
01:42:42,936 --> 01:42:44,335
l need ten groundnuts.

1693
01:42:45,673 --> 01:42:48,039
Five over here. And five over here.

1694
01:42:48,809 --> 01:42:53,371
A good candidate loses election
because half of the people don't vote.

1695
01:42:55,249 --> 01:42:58,047
And among those who vote..

1696
01:42:58,952 --> 01:43:01,944
The one who get
these many votes wins.

1697
01:43:02,089 --> 01:43:07,186
That means the one who gets
only 30% votes rules the country.

1698
01:43:08,328 --> 01:43:09,260
Because..

1699
01:43:09,363 --> 01:43:11,763
Because half of the population
doesn't vote. - They don't.

1700
01:43:13,100 --> 01:43:15,068
This is no longer an issue
between Bhau and me.

1701
01:43:15,102 --> 01:43:18,037
lt is an issue of every good
candidate in the country.

1702
01:43:19,039 --> 01:43:21,940
What should we do..

1703
01:43:22,476 --> 01:43:25,741
.. that they too come to vote.

1704
01:43:27,247 --> 01:43:29,715
How will we bring about
such a big change?

1705
01:43:30,150 --> 01:43:31,981
We'll have to make
people understand.

1706
01:43:32,319 --> 01:43:33,877
But who will make them understand.

1707
01:43:34,221 --> 01:43:36,280
He is contesting
so he should only do it.

1708
01:43:36,890 --> 01:43:39,154
Yes. You will. Who else?

1709
01:43:39,226 --> 01:43:40,784
Me?
- Yes.

1710
01:43:40,861 --> 01:43:42,351
Anyways, politicians give speeches.

1711
01:43:42,429 --> 01:43:43,726
That's when people go
to listen to them.

1712
01:43:43,797 --> 01:43:46,789
No, no, no.
Public.. No speeches. No speeches.

1713
01:43:46,867 --> 01:43:48,835
l lose my voice
in front of the crowd.

1714
01:43:49,103 --> 01:43:51,071
No.
- What are you saying?

1715
01:43:51,271 --> 01:43:54,502
l have stage fright.

1716
01:43:54,908 --> 01:43:55,806
Stage fright.

1717
01:43:55,909 --> 01:43:57,376
What.. what's tight?

1718
01:43:57,444 --> 01:43:58,308
What do you have?

1719
01:43:58,378 --> 01:43:59,345
l mean..

1720
01:43:59,980 --> 01:44:01,971
l cannot speak
in front of a crowd.

1721
01:44:02,182 --> 01:44:04,377
That's why l didn't get
any role in school dramas.

1722
01:44:04,451 --> 01:44:05,975
Nor did l ever get
a chance to say a speech.

1723
01:44:06,053 --> 01:44:07,452
And you are telling us all this now?

1724
01:44:07,521 --> 01:44:08,852
After creating such a big drama.

1725
01:44:08,922 --> 01:44:10,116
And when you also
need to give a speech.

1726
01:44:10,157 --> 01:44:11,852
So what should l do?

1727
01:44:12,159 --> 01:44:14,753
Why does he fearwhen
no one can see him?

1728
01:44:15,062 --> 01:44:17,223
But l can see them.

1729
01:44:17,798 --> 01:44:20,358
Hearthat. Then it's impossible
to bring about a change.

1730
01:44:21,835 --> 01:44:23,393
Let's record his voice.

1731
01:44:23,504 --> 01:44:26,371
Who will know whether he is talking
or a tape recorder is playing?

1732
01:44:27,341 --> 01:44:30,071
Good idea.
We will record your voice.

1733
01:44:32,079 --> 01:44:33,944
Leave that, first repairthis.

1734
01:44:34,515 --> 01:44:36,107
Hurry up.
l don't have time to waste.

1735
01:44:36,183 --> 01:44:37,912
How are you, Akhrot?

1736
01:44:38,018 --> 01:44:39,246
Hello, uncle!

1737
01:44:41,155 --> 01:44:42,452
Do it!

1738
01:44:46,093 --> 01:44:48,061
l have to record in this?
- Yes.

1739
01:44:48,495 --> 01:44:50,725
lt's very old.

1740
01:44:50,798 --> 01:44:52,129
Yes, it's of your generation.

1741
01:44:52,199 --> 01:44:53,826
Hey, you are a champion.

1742
01:44:53,867 --> 01:44:55,528
Come on, start talking.

1743
01:44:56,737 --> 01:44:58,068
Should l speak here?

1744
01:44:58,205 --> 01:44:59,229
Just speak.

1745
01:45:05,946 --> 01:45:06,935
What should l say?

1746
01:45:09,850 --> 01:45:11,613
What are you doing?

1747
01:45:11,685 --> 01:45:14,654
Don't think that you are
talking to a tape recorder.

1748
01:45:14,755 --> 01:45:16,552
lt won't come from your heart.

1749
01:45:17,558 --> 01:45:20,652
Just think that there is a crowd
standing over here. Just imagine.

1750
01:45:20,994 --> 01:45:23,963
You won't feel scared and it will
come from your heart as well.

1751
01:45:36,543 --> 01:45:37,908
Where's Bhoothnath?

1752
01:45:37,945 --> 01:45:39,845
When will his speech start?

1753
01:45:44,852 --> 01:45:48,219
lmagine that the day of your
death has been decided.

1754
01:45:49,523 --> 01:45:51,787
And you have been
given three choices.

1755
01:45:52,860 --> 01:45:54,885
You can die in any
of these three ways..

1756
01:45:55,963 --> 01:45:57,760
..by hanging yourself..

1757
01:45:58,799 --> 01:46:00,630
..by coming under a train or..

1758
01:46:00,834 --> 01:46:02,165
..by having cyanide.

1759
01:46:02,769 --> 01:46:06,671
So, you will think that hanging
yourself is troublesome.

1760
01:46:07,007 --> 01:46:09,305
lt will hurt if you
jump in front of a train.

1761
01:46:10,143 --> 01:46:12,270
Having cyanide is the best option.

1762
01:46:13,080 --> 01:46:15,548
No pain, no trouble, easy death.

1763
01:46:16,817 --> 01:46:19,752
This is the dilemma you
face every five years.

1764
01:46:20,020 --> 01:46:22,045
ln the form of elections.

1765
01:46:23,924 --> 01:46:26,825
Should you vote for someone who
has scammed 2000 crores rupees?

1766
01:46:26,927 --> 01:46:28,019
Orthe one who scammed
1000 crores rupees?

1767
01:46:28,095 --> 01:46:29,960
Orthe one who scammed
200 crores rupees?

1768
01:46:30,597 --> 01:46:32,963
Now compared to 2000 crores rupees
and 1000 crores rupees..

1769
01:46:33,033 --> 01:46:34,261
..the one with 200 crores rupees
scam seems honest.

1770
01:46:34,334 --> 01:46:36,131
So let's vote for him.

1771
01:46:36,837 --> 01:46:40,568
Though he'll loot us but
at least less than others.

1772
01:46:41,708 --> 01:46:45,075
Similarly when compared to people
who have committed 15 or 9 murders..

1773
01:46:45,612 --> 01:46:47,876
..a person who has committed
2 murders seems honest.

1774
01:46:47,948 --> 01:46:49,779
So let's vote for him.

1775
01:46:50,050 --> 01:46:51,176
What can we do?

1776
01:46:51,885 --> 01:46:53,750
We don't have any other choice.

1777
01:46:54,855 --> 01:46:57,619
This is the biggest
problem of our country.

1778
01:46:59,026 --> 01:47:03,224
We should vote forthe one
we like the most.

1779
01:47:04,765 --> 01:47:08,792
But we vote for
the one we least dislike.

1780
01:47:09,770 --> 01:47:11,635
This is not what happens
in Sweden and Finland.

1781
01:47:11,705 --> 01:47:14,606
Sweden and Finland are
two great countries in Europe.

1782
01:47:14,808 --> 01:47:16,036
This is not what happens there.

1783
01:47:16,143 --> 01:47:18,668
There if people don't like
any of the candidates..

1784
01:47:18,745 --> 01:47:21,839
..do you know whom do they
give their precious vote to?

1785
01:47:22,149 --> 01:47:27,086
They give their precious vote
to theirfavorite cartoon.

1786
01:47:27,988 --> 01:47:32,982
Hence Donald Duck is a very
popular leader out there.

1787
01:47:33,827 --> 01:47:36,921
So what will happen
if this happens in our country?

1788
01:47:37,664 --> 01:47:39,359
From Baliya, Chhota Bheem will win.

1789
01:47:42,069 --> 01:47:44,094
From Kanpur, Chacha Chaudhari.

1790
01:47:46,039 --> 01:47:47,802
From Nasik, Doremon.

1791
01:47:48,275 --> 01:47:49,902
And from Satara, Pokemon.

1792
01:47:52,412 --> 01:47:56,246
Unfortunately, in our country,
we are allowed..

1793
01:47:56,316 --> 01:48:00,116
..to vote for ministers
but not cartoons.

1794
01:48:09,496 --> 01:48:11,691
So, who will you vote for?

1795
01:48:12,599 --> 01:48:15,329
Tell me, who will you vote for?

1796
01:48:23,810 --> 01:48:26,404
- What happened?
- Nothing, the mic is not working. - Gone.

1797
01:48:26,546 --> 01:48:28,411
What happened?

1798
01:48:29,549 --> 01:48:31,073
Where did he disappear?

1799
01:48:31,818 --> 01:48:34,844
We are here to hear you speak.

1800
01:48:36,056 --> 01:48:38,047
What happened?
- Say something..

1801
01:48:38,458 --> 01:48:40,824
We can't see him.
Now we can't even hear him.

1802
01:48:40,961 --> 01:48:42,758
Did he just run away?

1803
01:48:42,896 --> 01:48:45,626
lt's feels good to hear you speak,
Bhoothnath..

1804
01:48:48,935 --> 01:48:50,459
Look..

1805
01:48:52,939 --> 01:48:57,399
l am not here to
ask you to vote for me.

1806
01:48:58,412 --> 01:49:02,075
l am here just to ask you to vote.

1807
01:49:03,850 --> 01:49:05,647
lt's okay if you don't want
to vote for Bhoothnath.

1808
01:49:05,786 --> 01:49:07,447
lt's okay if you don't
want to vote for Bhau.

1809
01:49:08,021 --> 01:49:09,545
Press the ''None
of the above'' button.

1810
01:49:09,623 --> 01:49:11,557
But please vote.

1811
01:49:12,059 --> 01:49:14,687
So that in future
if Bhoothnath wins..

1812
01:49:15,095 --> 01:49:18,496
..those who don't like
Bhoothnath don't feel..

1813
01:49:19,533 --> 01:49:22,866
..that Bhoothnath wouldn't have
won if they would've voted.

1814
01:49:25,038 --> 01:49:29,702
ln a democracy,
your vote is your voice.

1815
01:49:30,610 --> 01:49:34,671
You can make your country listen
to you through your vote.

1816
01:49:35,749 --> 01:49:37,910
So speak up. Please.

1817
01:49:38,518 --> 01:49:39,644
Say something at least.

1818
01:49:39,920 --> 01:49:45,825
Those who don't vote don't
want the country to hearthem.

1819
01:49:47,027 --> 01:49:50,758
So it's time to tell them that
if they don't wish to speak..

1820
01:49:51,498 --> 01:49:55,832
..if they have nothing to say, then
we won't want to hearthem either.

1821
01:49:56,837 --> 01:49:57,667
Sir..

1822
01:49:57,737 --> 01:50:00,069
Yes?
- Please explain.

1823
01:50:01,041 --> 01:50:02,872
Do you have a Voter lD Card?

1824
01:50:03,009 --> 01:50:04,033
No, sir.

1825
01:50:05,512 --> 01:50:07,912
l can't hear you.
Speak louder.

1826
01:50:08,115 --> 01:50:09,480
l don't have it, sir.

1827
01:50:09,783 --> 01:50:12,115
l still cannot hear you.
Speak louder.

1828
01:50:17,090 --> 01:50:18,114
Got it, sir.

1829
01:50:18,325 --> 01:50:19,849
He understood.

1830
01:50:21,428 --> 01:50:24,761
So, it is time to change.

1831
01:50:25,732 --> 01:50:28,860
And you have to bring
about this change.

1832
01:50:32,072 --> 01:50:33,699
Excuse me,
will you take me to Bandra?

1833
01:50:34,007 --> 01:50:35,372
Do you have a Voter lD Card?

1834
01:50:35,842 --> 01:50:37,275
No. Why?

1835
01:50:38,011 --> 01:50:38,978
Where do you want to go?

1836
01:50:39,045 --> 01:50:41,411
Bandra.
- Please speak a little louder.

1837
01:50:41,815 --> 01:50:43,248
l can't hear you. Bandra!
- What?

1838
01:50:43,350 --> 01:50:44,783
Have you lost your mind?

1839
01:50:45,218 --> 01:50:46,742
Taxi!

1840
01:50:47,220 --> 01:50:49,450
Mr. Magan, can l have sugar,
two kilos?

1841
01:50:50,457 --> 01:50:52,425
l said, l want two kilos of sugar.

1842
01:50:52,692 --> 01:50:55,388
Uncle, please give me a packet of biscuit.
- Can't you hear me?

1843
01:50:55,462 --> 01:50:57,760
l've been asking for sugar.

1844
01:50:58,231 --> 01:50:59,095
Here.

1845
01:50:59,166 --> 01:51:01,828
Aunty, first get
a Voter lD Card made.

1846
01:51:04,437 --> 01:51:06,029
What are you saying?

1847
01:51:06,106 --> 01:51:07,437
Are you crazy?

1848
01:51:07,707 --> 01:51:10,005
l cannot hear you.
- Are you deaf?

1849
01:51:11,178 --> 01:51:12,907
l love you.
- l can't hear you.

1850
01:51:13,046 --> 01:51:14,980
l love you!

1851
01:51:15,749 --> 01:51:17,011
l love you.

1852
01:51:17,150 --> 01:51:19,015
l can't hear you.

1853
01:51:20,053 --> 01:51:21,384
Speak louder.
l can't hear you.

1854
01:51:21,454 --> 01:51:22,284
10 rupees.

1855
01:51:22,355 --> 01:51:23,447
Speak louder. Louder.

1856
01:51:23,723 --> 01:51:26,021
10 rupees.
- Speak louder.

1857
01:51:27,260 --> 01:51:31,162
Excuse me, sir!
Sir, your shot is ready, sir

1858
01:51:31,431 --> 01:51:32,796
Shot is ready, sir.

1859
01:51:32,866 --> 01:51:34,197
Do one thing.
Come here and say it.

1860
01:51:34,434 --> 01:51:36,163
Sir.. Shot is ready, sir.

1861
01:51:38,004 --> 01:51:39,232
Come here and say it again.

1862
01:51:40,207 --> 01:51:42,004
Sir, shot is ready, sir.

1863
01:51:43,009 --> 01:51:45,477
Strange.
l can't hearfrom both my ears.

1864
01:51:46,780 --> 01:51:48,270
Did you get it ?

1865
01:51:48,415 --> 01:51:51,873
Steven Spielberg, have some shame.
Go and get your Voter lD made.

1866
01:51:52,152 --> 01:51:53,244
Go.

1867
01:51:56,489 --> 01:51:58,855
We have to do overtime
because of Bhoothnath.

1868
01:51:58,925 --> 01:51:59,983
What?

1869
01:52:02,696 --> 01:52:05,688
Okay, Mr. Tripathi.
Make a card for me as well.

1870
01:52:07,434 --> 01:52:10,164
And now from lndia. Ahead
of its parliamentary elections..

1871
01:52:10,437 --> 01:52:13,895
..lndia is witnessing a unique movement
in which people are turning a deaf ear..

1872
01:52:14,040 --> 01:52:15,974
..towards those who
don't have Voter lDs.

1873
01:52:16,476 --> 01:52:18,603
Many are terming this
Movement of Change..

1874
01:52:18,745 --> 01:52:22,704
lndia's first non-cooperation
movement since independence.

1875
01:52:27,887 --> 01:52:30,856
Don't worry. Bhoothnath
won't win the election.

1876
01:52:30,890 --> 01:52:34,724
lt doesn't make a difference whether
Bhoothnath wins or loses.

1877
01:52:34,861 --> 01:52:37,625
Worry about the non-cooperation
movement taking place outside.

1878
01:52:37,697 --> 01:52:40,097
That's what l am doing.
- Then our party is bound to go down.

1879
01:52:40,166 --> 01:52:43,897
And if our party goes down then
you too will lose your career.

1880
01:52:43,970 --> 01:52:44,994
Are you getting me?

1881
01:52:45,105 --> 01:52:46,231
l understand.

1882
01:52:46,873 --> 01:52:48,465
Here. Take it.

1883
01:52:49,009 --> 01:52:52,206
Bhoothnath is about to have a big rally
on the last day of campaigning.

1884
01:52:52,479 --> 01:52:54,947
l have a great idea.
- Please hear me out.

1885
01:52:56,149 --> 01:52:58,640
Do anything to ruin that rally.

1886
01:52:59,152 --> 01:53:01,643
Will you be able to do it or should
l give this job to someone else?

1887
01:53:01,721 --> 01:53:03,018
l'll do it.

1888
01:53:05,692 --> 01:53:06,681
l'm leaving.
- Okay.

1889
01:53:06,760 --> 01:53:07,749
Bye.

1890
01:53:08,495 --> 01:53:09,587
Okay.

1891
01:53:13,133 --> 01:53:17,126
No matter how hard you try
no one lets you change for good.

1892
01:53:18,038 --> 01:53:21,496
Looks like it's time
to show ourtrue colors.

1893
01:53:22,008 --> 01:53:24,203
lf Bhau wants to win the election..

1894
01:53:25,545 --> 01:53:29,003
..then someone will have
to be sacrificed this time as well.

1895
01:53:29,749 --> 01:53:32,513
But Bhau, we cannot kill Bhoothnath.

1896
01:53:33,620 --> 01:53:34,780
Can we?

1897
01:53:39,659 --> 01:53:42,890
Who says we cannot kill Bhoothnath?

1898
01:53:45,699 --> 01:53:47,064
Bye.
- Bye, Akhrot.

1899
01:53:47,133 --> 01:53:49,829
Get it tomorrow.
- Yes, l'll get it tomorrow.

1900
01:53:51,004 --> 01:53:51,993
Akhrot..

1901
01:53:52,105 --> 01:53:54,573
Kiddo.. Come here.

1902
01:53:54,874 --> 01:53:55,841
Come here.

1903
01:53:56,142 --> 01:53:57,200
Please come here.

1904
01:53:57,310 --> 01:53:58,538
How are you?

1905
01:53:59,612 --> 01:54:00,772
Would you like to have tea?

1906
01:54:01,281 --> 01:54:02,543
No?

1907
01:54:08,321 --> 01:54:13,281
Look, tell Bhoothnath not
to attend the Change Rally.

1908
01:54:13,793 --> 01:54:15,658
You know how Bhau is.

1909
01:54:18,431 --> 01:54:19,728
What if l don't tell him?

1910
01:54:24,704 --> 01:54:26,331
Then you won't be
able to talk again.

1911
01:54:26,573 --> 01:54:27,767
Forever.

1912
01:54:29,709 --> 01:54:30,607
Go.

1913
01:54:31,177 --> 01:54:31,700
Go.

1914
01:54:31,778 --> 01:54:33,439
Rememberwhat l told you.

1915
01:54:34,581 --> 01:54:35,707
No rally!

1916
01:54:36,950 --> 01:54:38,577
He is like dry dates!

1917
01:55:05,578 --> 01:55:09,412
Remember,
tomorrow is a big day for you.

1918
01:55:09,482 --> 01:55:10,949
Don't be scared.

1919
01:55:21,795 --> 01:55:22,659
Hey..

1920
01:55:24,030 --> 01:55:26,294
Are you talking
to me orto yourself?

1921
01:55:26,466 --> 01:55:27,990
Why will l feel scared?

1922
01:55:28,468 --> 01:55:29,696
l was talking to you.

1923
01:55:46,052 --> 01:55:46,916
Mom..

1924
01:55:47,720 --> 01:55:48,880
Yes?

1925
01:55:50,723 --> 01:55:52,452
l need to talk to you.

1926
01:55:53,526 --> 01:55:55,721
So late in the night?
What do you want to say?

1927
01:55:56,896 --> 01:55:58,830
Something l have never said before.

1928
01:56:00,066 --> 01:56:04,435
l know you keep the fresh
flatbread on top, for me.

1929
01:56:05,538 --> 01:56:07,733
And the stale ones at the bottom,
for yourself.

1930
01:56:12,378 --> 01:56:13,572
What's wrong, Akhrot?

1931
01:56:13,713 --> 01:56:15,078
Let me talk.

1932
01:56:17,484 --> 01:56:18,746
l know..

1933
01:56:20,820 --> 01:56:24,347
.. from where does a 10 rupee note
land in my pocket every morning.

1934
01:56:27,060 --> 01:56:31,463
Sometimes, l come home
late on purpose..

1935
01:56:33,800 --> 01:56:38,794
So that from your scolding
l can know how much you love me.

1936
01:56:40,406 --> 01:56:41,771
Are you alright?

1937
01:56:42,842 --> 01:56:47,939
The fact that you couldn't
send me to school hurts you.

1938
01:56:49,782 --> 01:56:51,773
Do you know why l didn't stray?

1939
01:56:52,485 --> 01:56:54,544
Because you are very nice, mom.

1940
01:56:56,856 --> 01:56:58,790
You are very strong.

1941
01:57:01,060 --> 01:57:03,051
Always stay strong.

1942
01:57:03,463 --> 01:57:04,953
What are you saying?!

1943
01:57:07,166 --> 01:57:08,861
One more thing..

1944
01:57:11,137 --> 01:57:14,004
You don't look good when you cry.

1945
01:57:40,166 --> 01:57:42,464
Here. Do attend the rally.

1946
01:57:42,835 --> 01:57:45,133
Here. Attend the Change Rally.

1947
01:57:45,505 --> 01:57:46,802
Here.

1948
01:58:00,753 --> 01:58:02,220
Bhoothnath isn't giving in.

1949
01:58:02,622 --> 01:58:04,556
He is continuing with
the arrangements.

1950
01:58:11,831 --> 01:58:13,731
Here. Come for Change Rally!

1951
01:58:14,033 --> 01:58:16,160
Kiddo, where can l find
Mr. Bhoothnath.

1952
01:58:16,469 --> 01:58:17,959
ln the rally.

1953
01:58:18,037 --> 01:58:19,868
Now we will have a rally for you.
- Come with us.

1954
01:58:19,939 --> 01:58:21,531
Come, Bhau will
have a rally for you.

1955
01:58:21,608 --> 01:58:22,905
Catch him!

1956
01:58:22,976 --> 01:58:24,568
Stop!
- Get him!

1957
01:58:25,244 --> 01:58:26,643
Come on! Come on! Come on!

1958
01:58:41,160 --> 01:58:42,718
Rama, you go there.

1959
01:58:43,596 --> 01:58:45,188
Ramesh, you take that lane.

1960
01:58:45,598 --> 01:58:46,530
Don't let him get away!

1961
01:58:55,742 --> 01:58:56,834
Let's go there!

1962
01:58:57,810 --> 01:58:58,606
Come on!

1963
01:59:09,989 --> 01:59:11,616
Don't just run blindly!

1964
01:59:11,691 --> 01:59:14,956
l'm warning you, Bhau will kill us
if we don't catch hold of the boy!

1965
02:01:43,276 --> 02:01:45,107
lt's my fault.

1966
02:01:50,049 --> 02:01:52,074
He is just a child.

1967
02:01:53,686 --> 02:01:55,654
l should have known.

1968
02:01:59,258 --> 02:02:01,192
Please forgive me. lt's my fault.

1969
02:02:01,260 --> 02:02:02,921
lt's not yourfault.

1970
02:02:08,034 --> 02:02:10,025
They had threatened Akhrot.

1971
02:02:11,337 --> 02:02:13,168
But he didn't want you..

1972
02:02:14,941 --> 02:02:16,306
..to back out.

1973
02:02:19,812 --> 02:02:22,212
Hence he hid it from all of us.

1974
02:02:24,851 --> 02:02:26,375
While we were bringing him here..

1975
02:02:27,987 --> 02:02:29,215
.. he told me..

1976
02:02:33,125 --> 02:02:34,057
''Mom..''

1977
02:02:36,762 --> 02:02:40,254
''No battle can be won
without making sacrifices.''

1978
02:02:44,403 --> 02:02:49,238
''And if my sacrifice is
needed to win this battle..''

1979
02:02:52,078 --> 02:02:53,272
''..then so be it.''

1980
02:02:59,318 --> 02:03:00,876
l am not sad.

1981
02:03:04,257 --> 02:03:05,986
l am proud of my son.

1982
02:03:20,907 --> 02:03:24,399
l won't let him sacrifice
himself so easily.

1983
02:03:26,045 --> 02:03:28,240
An attempt should be made.

1984
02:03:31,017 --> 02:03:32,075
l'll be back.

1985
02:03:32,852 --> 02:03:34,114
Please come back soon.

1986
02:03:35,254 --> 02:03:37,017
lt's important.

1987
02:03:37,456 --> 02:03:39,447
We have to attend
the Change Rally today.

1988
02:03:41,127 --> 02:03:43,721
What l am going to
do is more important.

1989
02:03:58,144 --> 02:03:59,975
Any news on Bhoothnath?

1990
02:04:00,880 --> 02:04:02,905
We have taught him
such a lesson that..

1991
02:04:13,592 --> 02:04:15,184
Don't be surprised.

1992
02:04:16,796 --> 02:04:18,127
Like all of you, l too have come..

1993
02:04:18,197 --> 02:04:20,825
..to attend Mr.
Bhoothnath's Change Rally.

1994
02:04:20,967 --> 02:04:22,696
But is Mr. Bhoothnath here?

1995
02:04:22,768 --> 02:04:23,894
He isn't?

1996
02:04:23,970 --> 02:04:25,665
Okay, he isn't.

1997
02:04:26,038 --> 02:04:27,903
He must be stuck in traffic.

1998
02:04:33,045 --> 02:04:34,945
l have to agree..

1999
02:04:36,916 --> 02:04:40,283
..Bhoothnath's politics
is of a different level.

2000
02:04:41,854 --> 02:04:46,120
He blames and accuses
politicians like us..

2001
02:04:46,792 --> 02:04:49,192
..that we disappear after elections.

2002
02:04:49,996 --> 02:04:52,294
But he disappeared
before the elections.

2003
02:04:56,202 --> 02:05:00,161
Getting influenced by
his sweet talk l had decided..

2004
02:05:00,239 --> 02:05:03,697
..that this time l would vote
for Mr.Bhoothnath.

2005
02:05:05,745 --> 02:05:09,841
But if he stays disappeared even after
winning then who will do the work?

2006
02:05:11,617 --> 02:05:13,278
Who will we blame?

2007
02:05:14,020 --> 02:05:15,248
This vacant chair?

2008
02:05:22,895 --> 02:05:24,658
lf Bhau doesn't do the job..

2009
02:05:24,764 --> 02:05:28,222
.. then you can at least
throw eggs and tomatoes at him.

2010
02:05:28,834 --> 02:05:30,859
l am standing right before you.

2011
02:05:32,038 --> 02:05:33,938
l haven't gone anywhere.
l am right here.

2012
02:05:34,173 --> 02:05:36,164
Your Bhau.

2013
02:05:40,980 --> 02:05:43,073
That's why l have changed my mind.

2014
02:05:44,150 --> 02:05:47,677
Now, l will vote for Bhau.

2015
02:05:49,789 --> 02:05:50,983
You are back?

2016
02:05:52,825 --> 02:05:56,124
Tell me, how can l help you?

2017
02:05:57,129 --> 02:05:59,063
Sir, l have a request to make.

2018
02:06:00,866 --> 02:06:02,299
Please spare that kid's life.

2019
02:06:02,368 --> 02:06:03,630
Please, sir.

2020
02:06:04,103 --> 02:06:05,195
He doesn't deserve to die.

2021
02:06:05,271 --> 02:06:07,739
Well, no one deserves to die.

2022
02:06:08,007 --> 02:06:10,202
We sent you down
to prove a small thing.

2023
02:06:10,276 --> 02:06:13,006
And you have created
such a big scene.

2024
02:06:13,345 --> 02:06:17,008
You became so selfish
in orderto prove yourself..

2025
02:06:17,116 --> 02:06:18,981
..that you didn't even
think about other ghosts.

2026
02:06:19,018 --> 02:06:20,883
Why did you need to get
into the mess of elections?

2027
02:06:20,953 --> 02:06:22,944
You have ridiculed the ghosts.

2028
02:06:25,124 --> 02:06:28,992
l.. l have ridiculed ghosts?

2029
02:06:30,863 --> 02:06:33,696
l am fighting this
election for myself?

2030
02:06:35,801 --> 02:06:37,632
l am selfish? Me?

2031
02:06:40,039 --> 02:06:42,735
Yes, sir. l am selfish.

2032
02:06:43,843 --> 02:06:45,811
And l am selfish because..

2033
02:06:46,712 --> 02:06:50,011
..that's the country l am going
to be born into in future..

2034
02:06:50,783 --> 02:06:54,048
..if l can bring about even
a little improvement in it.

2035
02:06:54,720 --> 02:06:56,381
Then l will do it.

2036
02:06:57,857 --> 02:07:01,953
So that when l am born again,
l open my eyes in a better country.

2037
02:07:05,631 --> 02:07:06,825
l am selfish?

2038
02:07:08,400 --> 02:07:09,389
Me?

2039
02:07:10,703 --> 02:07:13,672
All of you will be
born in this country.

2040
02:07:14,507 --> 02:07:18,671
Do you want the same country with
rotten systems, rules and regulations

2041
02:07:19,445 --> 02:07:22,005
You too are waiting with a
token in your hand to be born.

2042
02:07:22,081 --> 02:07:24,515
What will you gain
by being born there?

2043
02:07:25,918 --> 02:07:29,081
When you will grow
up with corrupt people..

2044
02:07:29,421 --> 02:07:31,855
..you will end up being corrupt.

2045
02:07:32,925 --> 02:07:34,825
When you won't be able
to get yourwork done..

2046
02:07:34,894 --> 02:07:38,591
..without the help of bribe seekers
then you will give bribe out of habit.

2047
02:07:39,665 --> 02:07:42,498
lf you don't bring
about a change now..

2048
02:07:43,202 --> 02:07:49,072
..then your right will be snatched by the wrong
person and you won't be able to do anything.

2049
02:07:49,141 --> 02:07:52,042
You won't be able to do anything.

2050
02:07:52,444 --> 02:07:55,038
You are talking as if
you have brought a change.

2051
02:07:55,214 --> 02:07:56,681
No, sir. No.

2052
02:07:56,749 --> 02:08:01,448
l am not saying that.
All l want is..

2053
02:08:01,887 --> 02:08:04,515
.. that you give that
kid another chance.

2054
02:08:04,957 --> 02:08:08,449
He has dreamt of a better country.

2055
02:08:08,761 --> 02:08:12,219
He deserves to see
that dream come true, sir.

2056
02:08:13,799 --> 02:08:14,959
Please, sir.

2057
02:08:18,637 --> 02:08:20,901
And what if you lose?

2058
02:08:22,975 --> 02:08:24,465
l understand, sir.

2059
02:08:24,743 --> 02:08:26,142
l understand.

2060
02:08:27,713 --> 02:08:29,681
lf l lose, then..

2061
02:08:30,549 --> 02:08:32,779
.. that kid has no right to live.

2062
02:08:33,252 --> 02:08:35,880
Anyways, what's the use
of him living in a country..

2063
02:08:35,955 --> 02:08:37,889
..which doesn't wish
to change for good.

2064
02:08:39,024 --> 02:08:41,254
But sir, if l win, then..

2065
02:08:42,595 --> 02:08:46,656
.. that kid should
get another chance.

2066
02:08:46,832 --> 02:08:48,163
Right, sir?

2067
02:08:53,172 --> 02:08:54,503
Okay.

2068
02:08:57,142 --> 02:09:00,976
lf you win the election..

2069
02:09:02,748 --> 02:09:04,147
.. the kid will live.

2070
02:09:04,550 --> 02:09:05,676
Thank you, sir.

2071
02:09:05,884 --> 02:09:07,044
Thank you, sir.

2072
02:09:07,119 --> 02:09:08,609
And l..

2073
02:09:09,288 --> 02:09:11,620
..l will pray that our man wins.

2074
02:09:11,824 --> 02:09:12,950
No, sir.

2075
02:09:13,859 --> 02:09:16,020
Pray that our country wins.

2076
02:09:16,795 --> 02:09:18,160
Our country.

2077
02:09:19,231 --> 02:09:25,966
l will pray that you
think twice before you vote.

2078
02:09:27,773 --> 02:09:29,001
Jai Hind!
(Hail Motherland!)

2079
02:09:30,009 --> 02:09:31,067
Long live..
- Bhau Sahib!

2080
02:09:31,176 --> 02:09:32,666
Long live..
- Bhau Sahib!

2081
02:09:32,745 --> 02:09:33,871
Long live..
- Bhau Sahib!

2082
02:09:33,946 --> 02:09:35,140
Long live..
- Bhau Sahib!

2083
02:09:35,247 --> 02:09:36,214
Long live..

2084
02:09:53,499 --> 02:09:55,524
We will win the election, right?

2085
02:09:58,070 --> 02:09:59,367
Where..

2086
02:10:00,739 --> 02:10:03,071
.. where have you been?

2087
02:10:04,743 --> 02:10:07,610
l had gone to beg for Akhrot's life.

2088
02:10:11,383 --> 02:10:13,374
We will win the election, right?

2089
02:10:14,653 --> 02:10:17,645
Otherwise, Akhrot will
lose his battle against death.

2090
02:10:19,124 --> 02:10:19,954
Now..

2091
02:10:21,827 --> 02:10:23,795
..l don't know whether
we will win or..

2092
02:10:24,930 --> 02:10:30,027
But Bhau has taken full
advantage of your absence.

2093
02:10:30,636 --> 02:10:32,160
lt's right, in a way.

2094
02:10:32,805 --> 02:10:33,669
Tomorrow is the day of the election.

2095
02:10:33,739 --> 02:10:36,731
People think you ran
away from the battlefield.

2096
02:10:36,909 --> 02:10:39,969
Under such circumstances
who will vote for us?

2097
02:10:40,145 --> 02:10:44,445
And don't think that Bhau
is not doing anything right now.

2098
02:10:45,918 --> 02:10:48,910
He will continue to do what
he does during every election.

2099
02:10:49,154 --> 02:10:50,519
To win.

2100
02:10:50,589 --> 02:10:51,851
Give liquor if you need to.

2101
02:10:51,924 --> 02:10:53,755
Shower money if you have to.

2102
02:10:53,992 --> 02:10:55,823
And hit them if they act smart.

2103
02:10:55,861 --> 02:10:59,888
He will try to bribe those
whose hearts he couldn't win.

2104
02:11:00,132 --> 02:11:01,827
Remember Bhau during the elections.

2105
02:11:01,900 --> 02:11:02,924
Okay?

2106
02:11:04,002 --> 02:11:06,903
Those he can't reason with,
he'll try to influence.

2107
02:11:07,005 --> 02:11:11,442
Ganpat, here. Remember Bhau.

2108
02:11:11,510 --> 02:11:12,670
Got it?

2109
02:11:12,811 --> 02:11:15,177
Those he couldn't influence..

2110
02:11:15,514 --> 02:11:18,074
..he will try to influence
them through his agents.

2111
02:11:18,183 --> 02:11:21,710
What difference does it make whether
Bhau wins or Bhoothnath does?

2112
02:11:21,854 --> 02:11:24,448
Look, l am the one who
gets yourwork done, right?

2113
02:11:24,556 --> 02:11:25,818
Then do as l say.

2114
02:11:25,891 --> 02:11:26,721
Threaten.

2115
02:11:26,792 --> 02:11:29,022
lf, you don't vote for Bhau then..

2116
02:11:29,962 --> 02:11:30,860
Got it?

2117
02:11:30,929 --> 02:11:33,864
To say, tomorrow will be a new day.

2118
02:11:34,199 --> 02:11:38,158
But it will be same
as any other election day.

2119
02:11:38,704 --> 02:11:40,899
Half of the people will
convert the official half day..

2120
02:11:40,973 --> 02:11:43,669
.. into a full day personal leave.

2121
02:11:43,742 --> 02:11:45,004
Picnic!

2122
02:11:45,911 --> 02:11:50,211
Bhau's men will gather
people from different places..

2123
02:11:50,549 --> 02:11:52,983
..and take them
to the polling booth.

2124
02:11:55,554 --> 02:11:57,146
And outside the polling booth..

2125
02:11:57,656 --> 02:12:00,853
..underthe pretext of helping
they will keep giving hints.

2126
02:12:01,093 --> 02:12:07,828
And they will decrease the
voting speed in your strong areas.

2127
02:12:09,201 --> 02:12:11,965
People will vote
in someone else's name.

2128
02:12:15,140 --> 02:12:17,700
Because you have done
so much forthe people..

2129
02:12:18,143 --> 02:12:20,168
..they will remember you.

2130
02:12:21,647 --> 02:12:24,980
But they will vote for Bhau.

2131
02:12:25,217 --> 02:12:27,981
Thank you forthe liquor, Bhau.

2132
02:12:39,932 --> 02:12:41,263
That's possible.

2133
02:12:42,367 --> 02:12:43,891
That's possible.

2134
02:12:46,071 --> 02:12:49,302
But it is also possible,
tomorrow brings a morning..

2135
02:12:50,242 --> 02:12:52,642
..this country has
never seen before.

2136
02:12:57,349 --> 02:13:00,011
lt will be a half day holiday..

2137
02:13:01,286 --> 02:13:03,379
.. but people will get to work..

2138
02:13:04,089 --> 02:13:05,351
Forthe country..

2139
02:13:05,724 --> 02:13:08,818
Uncle.. Wake up, uncle.
You need to go to vote.

2140
02:13:09,027 --> 02:13:10,619
You will keep brushing
yourteeth forever?

2141
02:13:10,696 --> 02:13:11,958
Don't you want to hurry up?

2142
02:13:12,798 --> 02:13:15,028
Ajay..
- Good morning, sir.

2143
02:13:15,367 --> 02:13:17,665
Why did you come
here so early today?

2144
02:13:18,804 --> 02:13:20,396
Who will go to vote?

2145
02:13:21,206 --> 02:13:22,366
Sorry, sir.

2146
02:13:24,710 --> 02:13:28,111
People who have decided
not to vote might perhaps..

2147
02:13:29,047 --> 02:13:30,981
..might perhaps change their mind.

2148
02:13:40,893 --> 02:13:44,294
And those whom they tried to buy,
will tell them..

2149
02:13:44,796 --> 02:13:46,889
Lallan..
- Who else is..

2150
02:13:47,132 --> 02:13:48,997
That they are not for sale.

2151
02:13:49,268 --> 02:13:52,101
Keep this and please leave us alone.

2152
02:13:52,237 --> 02:13:55,138
Those whom they tried to influence..

2153
02:13:56,842 --> 02:14:01,404
..they'll tell them that they
still have some sense left in them.

2154
02:14:01,780 --> 02:14:04,078
Thank you forthe liquor, Bhau.

2155
02:14:04,149 --> 02:14:05,912
But sorry.

2156
02:14:07,085 --> 02:14:10,452
Anyone who can cast a vote..

2157
02:14:11,790 --> 02:14:13,314
.. will vote.

2158
02:14:18,797 --> 02:14:20,958
My name is still on the voting list.

2159
02:14:21,166 --> 02:14:23,794
Someone else will
vote using my name, sir.

2160
02:14:24,202 --> 02:14:26,329
Please let me go, sir.
lt's the question of my future.

2161
02:14:26,438 --> 02:14:32,308
And people will cast
votes only on their name.

2162
02:14:37,049 --> 02:14:40,109
lf you want to vote using my name
then at least vote for my candidate.

2163
02:14:42,154 --> 02:14:47,854
lt is possible that instead
of giving up without a fight..

2164
02:14:48,527 --> 02:14:51,018
..people will try to fight and win.

2165
02:14:58,003 --> 02:15:01,063
lt is possible that people won't
think that nothing can be done.

2166
02:15:01,473 --> 02:15:05,807
They would instead think
that if they do something..

2167
02:15:06,545 --> 02:15:08,979
..then perhaps something
good might happen.

2168
02:15:12,284 --> 02:15:14,013
People..

2169
02:15:14,987 --> 02:15:18,047
.. might come in anyone's vehicle..

2170
02:15:19,224 --> 02:15:23,251
But they'll leave with a mark to
ensure the safety of their country.

2171
02:16:06,838 --> 02:16:09,102
'Something unprecedented
has happened in this country today.'

2172
02:16:09,174 --> 02:16:12,109
'Around 85% of the
people have voted.'

2173
02:16:12,244 --> 02:16:15,873
'And the highest percentage of
votes was given in Dharavi, Mumbai.'

2174
02:16:16,014 --> 02:16:19,381
'95% of people voted.'

2175
02:16:20,252 --> 02:16:24,712
'We will be back tomorrow
morning with the results.'

2176
02:16:25,257 --> 02:16:27,623
100% you will win, Bhau.

2177
02:16:27,959 --> 02:16:29,950
No one can stop you.

2178
02:16:31,196 --> 02:16:32,356
l'm telling you.

2179
02:17:13,105 --> 02:17:14,333
Mr. Bhoothnath!

2180
02:17:14,773 --> 02:17:15,797
Mr. Bhoothnath?

2181
02:17:16,274 --> 02:17:17,241
l know.

2182
02:17:17,943 --> 02:17:19,740
l know.

2183
02:17:36,695 --> 02:17:40,859
Oh damn. We have a lot
to do forthe election..

2184
02:18:17,803 --> 02:18:21,170
We celebrate in such
a way only when lndia wins.

2185
02:18:23,508 --> 02:18:25,476
lndia has won.

2186
02:18:28,380 --> 02:18:30,143
lndia has won.
