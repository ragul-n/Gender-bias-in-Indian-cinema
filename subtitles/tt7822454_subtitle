1
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:14,416
Hey, remember what I said.

2
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:16,750
How many times have I told you
not to cross the road?

3
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:19,333
But there are sweet potatoes
on the other side of the road.

4
00:02:19,458 --> 00:02:20,541
I want to eat them, Daddy.

5
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:22,041
Shut up. Come back.

6
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:23,833
I will go.

7
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:26,041
Hey, pig. Can't you understand?

8
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:28,333
Are you a human being
who has to be told repeatedly? Come back.

9
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:31,083
I'll come back after eating two potatoes.

10
00:02:32,708 --> 00:02:34,333
You should not go there. That's it.

11
00:02:34,541 --> 00:02:35,541
But why, Daddy?

12
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:39,875
Once there was a piglet who didn't listen
to his parents and ran onto the road.

13
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,125
What happened to him?

14
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,416
See for yourself.

15
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:03,291
What's happening?
The tension is killing me.

16
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:06,333
<span style="style.default_1">The courier just rang the bell.</span>

17
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:07,750
-Does he have the box?
-Yes.

18
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:10,791
Raji came out.

19
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:11,833
And?

20
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:14,791
The courier is scratching...

21
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:15,791
Tell him I'll kill him.

22
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:18,083
He's scratching his butt, not Raji's.

23
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:22,375
<span style="style.default_1">"This card is not enough to apologize
for all the mistakes I've made.</span>

24
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:24,458
<span style="style.default_1">Please forgive me, Raji."</span>

25
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:26,125
Please sign here, ma'am.

26
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:30,083
Take this.

27
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:33,666
What's happening? Tell me.

28
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,083
She took the box.

29
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:36,041
And?

30
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:38,208
She went inside and closed the door.

31
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:39,958
Why did she do that?

32
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:43,000
People close doors after going inside
and open them before coming out.

33
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:56,625
Hey, Raji is coming here.

34
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:05,916
Hurry up!

35
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,416
Can you please hold this?

36
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:24,708
Who's this guy who got slapped
during the introduction?

37
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:25,708
Who is he, Daddy?

38
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:27,666
Abhishek. Abhishek Varma.

39
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:31,166
Mr. Abhishek Varma,
our company makes many essential goods.

40
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:33,083
Can you tell us which toothpaste you use?

41
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:34,375
Tulsi Krishna Toothpaste.

42
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,416
How about for soap?

43
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,541
Tulsi Krishna Soap.

44
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:37,791
And shaving foam?

45
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:39,250
Tulsi Krishna Shaving Foam.

46
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:42,125
Is Tulsi Krishna an Ayurvedic brand?

47
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:44,416
No. Tulsi Krishna is my roommate, sir.

48
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:49,708
If the company you're working for
is incurring losses in the first quarter,

49
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:53,916
which is the first three months,
and in the second and third quarters too,

50
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:57,208
what would you do as a manager
after the three quarters?

51
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,833
After three quarters, I won't do anything
but dance to the "Lungi Dance."

52
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:04,833
Mr. Abhishek Varma,
where do you see yourself in five years?

53
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:07,541
In five years, I'll be buying and selling
dozens of companies like yours.

54
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:11,666
And before you ask me, in ten years,
all the film companies

55
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,833
will be fighting each other
for the right to make my biopic.

56
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:17,083
In 15 years, I'll contest the elections,
become the Prime Minister,

57
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:18,958
and change
the financial situation of the country.

58
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:24,375
It's very clear that you're not interested
in the job we are offering.

59
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:25,500
You are right, sir.

60
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:27,000
Why did you come to the interview, then?

61
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:29,541
My girlfriend made me promise
that I will go to the interview.

62
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:32,166
What exactly do you want to do
with your life?

63
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,375
I want to hit it.

64
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:34,708
What? Who?

65
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:35,833
Not a person, sir.

66
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:37,208
I want to hit the jackpot.

67
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:39,708
If I don't, I'll quit everything
and just stay at home.

68
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:40,958
The jackpot?

69
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:42,250
A jackpot.

70
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:52,500
What happened?

71
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,875
Did they offer you a job?

72
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:55,541
-No, they didn't!
-Why?

73
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:58,458
They think I'm overqualified for the job.

74
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:01,166
-Overqualified to be a trainee?
-Yes.

75
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:03,875
Abhi, did you say something stupid
during the interview?

76
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:06,375
No. They just asked me questions
and I answered them.

77
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:07,583
-That's it.
-What did they ask?

78
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:09,333
They asked me
what I wanted to do with my life.

79
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:10,916
I told them I want to hit a goal.

80
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,041
They asked what it is. I said, a jackpot.

81
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:14,083
A jackpot?

82
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:17,583
Abhi, how can I introduce you to my dad
if you don't have a job?

83
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:21,500
Tell him I'm on the same path to greatness
as Bill Gates and Steve Jobs.

84
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:23,666
Tell him I'm going to hit a goal.

85
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,166
-What goal?
-The jackpot.

86
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:40,625
<span style="style.default_1">Is he mad?</span>

87
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:42,541
<span style="style.default_1">Is he good?</span>

88
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,083
<span style="style.default_1">I don't really understand him</span>

89
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:47,958
<span style="style.default_1">Is he fickle?</span>

90
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,958
<span style="style.default_1">Is he crazy?</span>

91
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:53,541
<span style="style.default_1">He annoys me and makes me mad</span>

92
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:55,833
<span style="style.default_1">Oh, my God!</span>

93
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:57,666
<span style="style.default_1">How do I?</span>

94
00:08:57,916 --> 00:09:01,458
<span style="style.default_1">How do I adjust to him?
Continue to be with him? Stay with him?</span>

95
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:05,000
<span style="style.default_1">He keeps killing me</span>

96
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:09,375
<span style="style.default_1">But he wouldn't hesitate
To give his life for me</span>

97
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:13,166
<span style="style.default_1">He is a stupid boyfriend</span>

98
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:16,708
<span style="style.default_1">Though he is difficult, I still like him</span>

99
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:20,708
<span style="style.default_1">He is a stupid boyfriend</span>

100
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:24,166
<span style="style.default_1">Though he is difficult, I still like him</span>

101
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:46,375
YUCK!

102
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:50,375
<span style="style.default_1">He has no punctuality
He doesn't have any clarity</span>

103
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:54,083
<span style="style.default_1">But his smile pulls me like gravity</span>

104
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:57,916
<span style="style.default_1">He says one thing and does another</span>

105
00:09:58,166 --> 00:10:01,333
<span style="style.default_1">But I like how his love is so pure</span>

106
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:05,041
<span style="style.default_1">The mistakes he commits give me a headache</span>

107
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:08,416
<span style="style.default_1">It doesn't subside, no matter what I do</span>

108
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:12,416
<span style="style.default_1">His mind may have a defect
But his heart is perfect</span>

109
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:17,708
<span style="style.default_1">I'm addicted to him</span>

110
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:21,416
<span style="style.default_1">He's a stupid boyfriend</span>

111
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:24,958
<span style="style.default_1">Though he is difficult, I still like him</span>

112
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:28,916
<span style="style.default_1">He's a stupid boyfriend</span>

113
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:32,291
<span style="style.default_1">Though he is difficult, I still like him</span>

114
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:58,708
<span style="style.default_1">If you eat sweets, you get fat</span>

115
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:02,708
<span style="style.default_1">But we don't stop
We just keep eating sweets</span>

116
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:06,291
<span style="style.default_1">Salt and spices affect your blood pressure</span>

117
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:09,625
<span style="style.default_1">But we have it in all our meals</span>

118
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:13,333
<span style="style.default_1">He is and the salt and the sweets</span>

119
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:16,833
<span style="style.default_1">Though we say no, we want more of him</span>

120
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:20,791
<span style="style.default_1">He is a lovely carrot and I'm a rabbit</span>

121
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:22,375
<span style="style.default_1">There is only one reason</span>

122
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:29,791
<span style="style.default_1">He's a stupid boyfriend</span>

123
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:33,375
<span style="style.default_1">Though he is difficult, I still like him</span>

124
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:37,208
<span style="style.default_1">He's a stupid boyfriend</span>

125
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:40,916
<span style="style.default_1">Though he is difficult, I still like him</span>

126
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:43,875
Who is this guy, Daddy?
He sounds like a crazy fellow.

127
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:46,083
He's not just crazy,
he's the craziest of them all.

128
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:50,083
That's why his girlfriend dumped him.

129
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:02,541
Don't look at him.

130
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:04,916
He has no sense of responsibility at all.

131
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:08,625
You did everything you could
to set him straight.

132
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:10,500
You spoke to your boss
and got an interview for him.

133
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:11,583
You know what happened next.

134
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:16,458
Is my boss not there yet?

135
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:17,916
He's not here yet. I'm waiting for him.

136
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:19,291
Abhi, he is very sensitive.

137
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:22,416
I'll pass this interview.

138
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:23,916
He is here, Raji.

139
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,041
-What is it, Rani?
-<span style="style.default_1">You left without saying goodbye.</span>

140
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:35,875
I have an interview with a boy.

141
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:37,375
And what's with the heavy lunch box?

142
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:41,750
<span style="style.default_1">Because of today's festival,
I made all of your favorite dishes.</span>

143
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:43,291
I'll see you later this evening.

144
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:44,416
<span style="style.default_1">Bye.</span>

145
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:48,375
Okay, I'm coming.

146
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,458
I need to instruct the employees.
I'll be right back.

147
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:42,250
Yes, sir.

148
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:44,625
I've asked the Accounts Department
to give you two months' salary.

149
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:46,333
Is it my bonus?

150
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:47,958
You know our company policy.

151
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:50,416
We give people two months' salary
before firing them.

152
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:54,916
He has no intention to work.

153
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,458
I just forced him into it.

154
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:59,833
Three days ago, he was sick and starving.

155
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:01,458
He was on medication.

156
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:03,208
He must have been hungry.

157
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:07,041
He was on medication,
but for a hangover, not a fever.

158
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:08,750
Raji, there is nothing good about him.

159
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:10,333
Even your dad would agree with me.

160
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,666
It is important to gain positive energy.

161
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,416
And it is equally important to stay away
from negative energy.

162
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:20,208
They coexist like good and evil.
They are all around us.

163
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:22,875
There are three steps involved
in dealing with negative energy.

164
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:25,708
Realize its presence.

165
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,458
Identify its source.

166
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:28,791
Stay away from the source.

167
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:32,666
If you know that a person
is a source of negative energy,

168
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:34,875
stay away from that person.

169
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,916
Even just shaking their hand
is enough to shake up your entire life.

170
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:43,333
Let us meditate for some time.

171
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:47,291
<span style="style.default_1">-Om...
-Om...</span>

172
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:48,250
Bye, dude.

173
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:00,000
What kind of cake did you buy?

174
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:06,625
Dad, this is Abhishek.

175
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:07,750
Hello, sir.

176
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:09,083
One moment.

177
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:13,625
-Is this Mr. Benerjee Rao?
-Yes.

178
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:16,500
-I'm calling from Dr. Shankar's clinic.
-Okay.

179
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,708
The doctor asked me
to tell you the good news

180
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:20,041
as soon as we got the results.

181
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:22,750
<span style="style.default_1">Everything is under control.</span>

182
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:24,458
Thank you, sir.

183
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:26,791
The reports show
that everything is under control.

184
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:28,916
Dad. Abhishek.

185
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:30,000
Hello, sir.

186
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:38,291
-I'm calling from Dr. Shankar's clinic.
-Yes?

187
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:40,750
Are you I. Benerjee Rao
or L. Benerjee Rao?

188
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:41,916
L. Benerjee Rao.

189
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:44,041
I gave you the wrong results.

190
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:45,458
Your sugar level is 350.

191
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,833
Your kidney and liver functions
have fallen to 30%.

192
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:52,083
There are three 80% blockages
in your heart.

193
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:55,083
There is a small clot in your brain.

194
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:58,875
You are advised to get admitted
to the hospital immediately.

195
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:10,125
<span style="style.default_1">Even just shaking their hand
is enough to shake up your entire life.</span>

196
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:16,166
He bought a cake for you.
Come, let's slice it.

197
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:30,000
-Sir!
-Daddy!

198
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:31,750
-Daddy!
-Sir!

199
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:35,291
Daddy!

200
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:43,583
Daddy?

201
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:45,166
What did he do wrong?

202
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:47,833
Maybe. But what about
that incident with Snowy?

203
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,750
Feed him at one o'clock.

204
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:53,708
He drinks a lot of water,
so make sure that the bowl is always full.

205
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:56,041
I'll come and pick him up in a while.

206
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:01,458
Why do they call this Pedigree?

207
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:03,208
Because it's for dogs who have a degree.

208
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:05,500
It's Abhishek.

209
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:06,833
In one hour?

210
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:11,875
Guys, I have a meeting
with a venture capitalist.

211
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:13,375
I'll be back soon. Take care of Snowy.

212
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:14,791
Take this.

213
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:18,833
May God bless you!
May you prosper in your endeavors!

214
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,625
I asked why we should
invest in your project.

215
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:36,583
Dude, can we eat dog biscuits?

216
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:38,541
-I shouldn't, but you can.
-Why?

217
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:39,875
-I'm a man and you're a dog.
-You!

218
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:40,916
Open the soda first.

219
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:54,125
Why is that dog staring at me like that?

220
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:57,750
He is wondering why you have
very little hair on your head.

221
00:17:57,916 --> 00:18:00,958
What? Do I look like a bald fool to him?

222
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:06,166
From his expression, I think he's proud
that he has more hair than you.

223
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,750
Is that so? He feels good?

224
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:10,833
See, he agrees with me.

225
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:14,041
A disposable mobile phone?

226
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:15,125
Who will buy it?

227
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:17,916
It's a phone with 100 minutes'
worth of credits and costs just 25 rupees.

228
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,958
Everyone will buy it.

229
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:20,958
How will you make a mobile phone
worth 25 rupees?

230
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:31,041
He should not have more hair than I do.

231
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:33,750
That's right. Even I feel the same.

232
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,250
We will invest as much money as you want
if you can make it cost 25 rupees.

233
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:42,333
I'll need ten crores
just to make the prototype.

234
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:43,875
I don't have a lot of money, sir.

235
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:56,958
Guys!

236
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,666
What are you doing?

237
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,833
What's this?

238
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:02,750
He felt proud about
having more hair than me.

239
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:03,750
We just killed his pride.

240
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:04,708
Snowy!

241
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:07,333
Snowy!

242
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:12,708
-Raji!
-Raji!

243
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:13,625
Raji.

244
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:16,458
You were going to tell a piglet's story.
Why tell me about this freak, Daddy?

245
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:18,541
If you keep interrupting me,
I won't tell you the story.

246
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:20,833
No, Daddy. Please continue, Daddy.

247
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:24,625
Dude, have you booked the tickets
for the movie?

248
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:25,708
What are you doing?

249
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:28,041
Looking for a dog for Raji.

250
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,083
There. Just like Snowy.

251
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:30,041
Are you going to buy it?

252
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,375
It costs 20,000. Where's your money?

253
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,083
<span style="style.default_1">-I will sell my bike.
-How will you get around?</span>

254
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:36,083
<span style="style.default_1">I'll use your bike!</span>

255
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,208
Why did she slap you like that?

256
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:53,291
Did the dog inside the box
suffocate and die?

257
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:06,541
Where did you come from, little piggy?

258
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:07,750
Where did he come from, Daddy?

259
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:08,833
He came from Gannavaram.

260
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:19,000
Bunty, stop.

261
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:20,875
Stop.

262
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:08,000
Bunty, stop.

263
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:10,750
Stop. Bunty, stop.

264
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:15,833
Bunty, don't go towards the road.

265
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:17,541
Bunty, don't go.

266
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:19,041
Bunty!

267
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:25,333
Sorry, sir. It looks like
your number plate is about to fall off.

268
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:28,916
If you run towards the road again,
I'll slap you.

269
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,416
-Hey, kid.
-Yes, sir?

270
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,541
Is that piglet yours?

271
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:32,916
Yes, sir. His name is Bunty.

272
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Can you let me have him for a few days?

273
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:35,958
No, sir.

274
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:38,208
I'll give you a lot of money.
I just need him for four days.

275
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:40,125
-I won't give him to you. I won't.
-Hey, kid. Please.

276
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:41,166
-Stop, kid.
-Dad.

277
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:42,958
-I won't give him.
-What's happening, Chanti?

278
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:43,875
-Dad.
-Chanti.

279
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:44,791
Mom.

280
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:46,291
What happened, Chanti?

281
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:47,625
Who are you, sir? What do you want?

282
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:48,666
We want that piglet.

283
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,625
That's my son's pet, sir.

284
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:53,000
-He loves it very much.
-I won't give him.

285
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:54,708
-He must give it.
-Dear son.

286
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:56,333
Dad!

287
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:57,750
-Bunty!
-Chanti.

288
00:21:57,833 --> 00:21:58,916
-Chanti, stop!
-Bunty!

289
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,750
Sir, please return Bunty to me.

290
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:03,125
Sir!

291
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:05,666
Bunty!

292
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:08,166
Bunty!

293
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:10,125
Sir!

294
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:13,000
Bunty!

295
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,916
Sir, please stop! Bunty!

296
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:20,750
Bunty!

297
00:22:22,416 --> 00:22:23,250
Bunty!

298
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:32,500
Boss, you're very lucky.

299
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:34,166
-<span style="style.default_1">Why?</span>
-We found the piglet, boss.

300
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:35,125
-<span style="style.default_1">Really?</span>
-Yes.

301
00:22:35,208 --> 00:22:37,625
A white piglet with three spots
on its belly, just like you said.

302
00:22:45,625 --> 00:22:48,125
Dad, these guys sound scary. Who are they?

303
00:22:48,208 --> 00:22:49,125
They're Shakti's goons.

304
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:50,125
Who's Shakti?

305
00:23:23,208 --> 00:23:25,041
Boss, Mr. MRO is here.

306
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:39,458
What's the matter, Mr. MRO?
I heard you refused to sign the documents.

307
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:40,500
Shakti...

308
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:43,666
Hey.

309
00:23:46,333 --> 00:23:47,833
The land is next to the water.

310
00:23:48,208 --> 00:23:50,291
Even if I sign the document,
the collector won't.

311
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,000
I'll take care of the collector.

312
00:23:52,666 --> 00:23:53,541
Sign it first.

313
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:55,000
I won't.

314
00:23:55,291 --> 00:23:57,625
If you sign it,
I'll give you the big briefcase.

315
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
If you don't,
you will have to take the small box.

316
00:24:03,083 --> 00:24:04,333
What's inside the big briefcase?

317
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:08,333
And the little box?

318
00:24:08,916 --> 00:24:11,416
There's no rush.
I'll tell you, but let's watch TV first.

319
00:24:11,541 --> 00:24:12,791
<span style="style.default_1">Help!</span>

320
00:24:12,875 --> 00:24:14,333
Rani!

321
00:24:14,625 --> 00:24:16,000
<span style="style.default_1">Help!</span>

322
00:24:16,375 --> 00:24:17,250
Rani...

323
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:19,333
Rani!

324
00:24:21,541 --> 00:24:22,666
Hey, Mr. MRO!

325
00:24:23,083 --> 00:24:24,416
Look inside the small box.

326
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:29,083
Hey, what is this?

327
00:24:29,166 --> 00:24:30,125
Hey, Jumbo.

328
00:24:30,333 --> 00:24:32,291
Cut it into two and fry it.

329
00:24:32,375 --> 00:24:33,750
Mr. MRO and I will each have a piece.

330
00:24:33,833 --> 00:24:35,958
You're going to fry my wife's ear
and eat it?

331
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:37,958
Why? Do you want me to stew it?

332
00:24:38,125 --> 00:24:41,625
Guys, tell them to cut her
into small pieces and send her here.

333
00:24:41,708 --> 00:24:43,541
-Mr. MRO is going to have lunch here.
-Shakti!

334
00:24:44,208 --> 00:24:46,083
I beg you. Please don't do it.

335
00:24:47,125 --> 00:24:50,208
-Sign the document.
-I will...

336
00:24:52,583 --> 00:24:53,458
Hey!

337
00:24:53,541 --> 00:24:56,291
Send our veterinary doctor there
and tell him to stitch her ear back.

338
00:24:57,666 --> 00:25:00,375
Shakti sounds like a demon, Daddy.

339
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,416
What are his people doing in Amaravathi?

340
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,916
They are running away from Durgaah's men.

341
00:25:05,041 --> 00:25:06,041
Who is Durgaah, Daddy?

342
00:25:08,875 --> 00:25:10,333
<span style="style.default_1">A hooligan and smart</span>

343
00:25:10,416 --> 00:25:11,875
<span style="style.default_1">Completely insane</span>

344
00:25:11,958 --> 00:25:14,875
<span style="style.default_1">He will kill you
He will tear you</span>

345
00:25:14,958 --> 00:25:17,875
<span style="style.default_1">He will burn you
He will cut you into pieces</span>

346
00:25:17,958 --> 00:25:20,833
<span style="style.default_1">He will crush you under his feet
He will chop off your tongue</span>

347
00:25:20,916 --> 00:25:23,916
<span style="style.default_1">He will suck your bones dry
He will rip you apart</span>

348
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,916
<span style="style.default_1">He is a vulture
He will feast on your blood</span>

349
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,083
<span style="style.default_1">Durgaah!</span>

350
00:25:28,375 --> 00:25:29,791
<span style="style.default_1">Durgaah!</span>

351
00:25:29,875 --> 00:25:31,000
<span style="style.default_1">Durgaah!</span>

352
00:25:31,416 --> 00:25:32,916
<span style="style.default_1">Durgaah!</span>

353
00:25:33,083 --> 00:25:35,333
This guy sounds like
an even meaner demon, Daddy.

354
00:25:35,416 --> 00:25:38,083
Why was there enmity
between Shakti and Durgaah?

355
00:25:38,166 --> 00:25:42,666
Durgaah and Shakti used to be rivals
in the Hyderabad real estate business.

356
00:25:47,416 --> 00:25:50,958
<span style="style.default_1">After the Telangana's creation,
Durgaah moved to Amaravathi.</span>

357
00:25:59,583 --> 00:26:03,416
<span style="style.default_1">There, he used violence and stole
a thousand acres of land from the farmers.</span>

358
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:12,708
<span style="style.default_1">Shakti heard about this and planned to
steal the land from Durgaah.</span>

359
00:26:13,291 --> 00:26:16,208
So, according to this plan,
Shakti's goons came to Amaravathi.

360
00:26:16,791 --> 00:26:19,625
Not a single document remains, boss.
He burnt all the documents.

361
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:32,958
Only the two of you know the password.

362
00:26:34,375 --> 00:26:37,625
<span style="style.default_1">He downloaded everything
about the document scans, addresses,</span>

363
00:26:37,708 --> 00:26:40,916
<span style="style.default_1">and signature samples onto a microchip
before deleting them from the computer.</span>

364
00:26:44,916 --> 00:26:47,500
If someone produces the papers
for the 1,000 acres

365
00:26:47,583 --> 00:26:50,500
and submits them to the government
by eleven o'clock the next day,

366
00:26:50,583 --> 00:26:52,166
we will lose all the land.

367
00:26:54,375 --> 00:26:57,000
Do you know how much 1,000 acres of land
is worth in the new capital city?

368
00:26:58,625 --> 00:27:00,750
Who did you give the microchip to?

369
00:27:02,708 --> 00:27:04,625
Boss, our driver saw the whole thing.

370
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:08,000
He told me to take him
to the Venkateswara Lodge,

371
00:27:08,083 --> 00:27:09,416
and that somebody came from Hyderabad.

372
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,041
<span style="style.default_1">He met two guys. He gave them something.</span>

373
00:27:11,541 --> 00:27:12,750
<span style="style.default_1">They gave him a bag.</span>

374
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,333
<span style="style.default_1">There was a lot of money in that bag.</span>

375
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:19,000
He said he would kill me if I told anyone.

376
00:27:19,833 --> 00:27:21,541
Venkateswara Lodge?

377
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:25,166
Where are the people
who came from Hyderabad?

378
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:26,500
They had just checked out.

379
00:27:26,583 --> 00:27:28,833
-There they are.
-Get them.

380
00:27:29,875 --> 00:27:31,083
Get them.

381
00:27:33,458 --> 00:27:34,958
Hey, look for them.

382
00:27:36,333 --> 00:27:37,375
Get them. Hey!

383
00:27:38,958 --> 00:27:41,416
Come on. Hurry up!

384
00:27:42,625 --> 00:27:43,583
Come on!

385
00:27:56,791 --> 00:27:58,458
-Hey, who are you? Get out of the way.
-Get out!

386
00:27:58,791 --> 00:27:59,625
Go.

387
00:27:59,708 --> 00:28:00,583
Turn right.

388
00:28:17,583 --> 00:28:19,750
Jayabhaskar will cook it
and it will taste delicious.

389
00:28:19,833 --> 00:28:22,375
Fool, a pig shouldn't eat its kind.
Let's go.

390
00:28:35,916 --> 00:28:40,541
I'm going to cook your flesh
and eat you for three days.

391
00:28:45,458 --> 00:28:46,291
Bunty...

392
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:53,333
I'll cut you into tiny pieces.
I'll marinate you with spices.

393
00:28:53,416 --> 00:28:56,250
I'll fry you. I'll make a stew out of you.

394
00:28:56,333 --> 00:28:57,583
What do you say, man?

395
00:29:00,583 --> 00:29:01,458
Bunty...

396
00:29:28,083 --> 00:29:29,041
Stay at the back.

397
00:29:32,833 --> 00:29:35,291
Daddy, will they really eat Bunty?

398
00:29:35,375 --> 00:29:36,583
They don't have time for that yet.

399
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:40,666
<span style="style.default_1">First, they needed to get away
from Durgaah's goons and flee Vijayawada.</span>

400
00:29:42,041 --> 00:29:43,250
There they are.

401
00:29:43,333 --> 00:29:45,750
-Let's go.
-Hey, let's go.

402
00:29:46,083 --> 00:29:47,541
-Stop.
-Stop.

403
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:49,791
-Stop.
-Stop.

404
00:29:49,875 --> 00:29:50,875
-Stop.
-Stop the vehicle.

405
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:03,833
What's a car registered in Hyderabad
doing in Vijayawada?

406
00:30:03,916 --> 00:30:07,291
We came to the Durgaah Temple
to venerate the Goddess. Hail!

407
00:30:12,291 --> 00:30:13,875
-Let's go.
-Hail the Goddess!

408
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,416
It will be better if we send the microchip
via courier. Where is it?

409
00:30:22,708 --> 00:30:24,458
-Where is it?
-I put it inside a banana.

410
00:30:24,541 --> 00:30:25,458
And where is the banana?

411
00:30:26,416 --> 00:30:27,666
I think the piglet ate it.

412
00:30:27,791 --> 00:30:28,666
You are an idiot!

413
00:30:34,875 --> 00:30:36,666
How can we send a piglet?

414
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:38,583
Shakti told us to do it. We have to do it.

415
00:30:39,541 --> 00:30:41,083
Send this piglet to Hyderabad.

416
00:30:44,458 --> 00:30:48,666
If I don't get the documents
and submit them to Amaravathi in 24 hours,

417
00:30:49,083 --> 00:30:50,375
I'll lose 1,000 acres of land.

418
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:53,500
Do you know how much that is worth
in the new capital city?

419
00:30:53,583 --> 00:30:54,583
No, sir.

420
00:31:01,083 --> 00:31:02,583
-What is it?
-A delivery for Shakti.

421
00:31:02,666 --> 00:31:04,208
The name is Six Pack Shakti!

422
00:31:04,291 --> 00:31:06,791
The microchip with the signature samples
will be here in a little while.

423
00:31:07,291 --> 00:31:10,041
-Practice the signatures well.
-Okay, sir.

424
00:31:10,625 --> 00:31:11,750
The courier is here, boss.

425
00:31:18,291 --> 00:31:19,125
Open it.

426
00:31:28,583 --> 00:31:31,125
You said it was a piglet.
How did it become a dog?

427
00:31:31,333 --> 00:31:33,208
I swear, boss. We sent over a piglet.

428
00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:34,791
It had three spots on its belly.

429
00:31:34,875 --> 00:31:36,583
So how did it become a dog?

430
00:31:36,791 --> 00:31:37,958
Okay, I got it.

431
00:31:38,125 --> 00:31:40,250
It was because of a confusion
at the courier office.

432
00:31:40,375 --> 00:31:42,416
The boxes got interchanged.

433
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:45,500
Not bad, son. You are following the story
without getting confused.

434
00:31:45,625 --> 00:31:47,083
I want that piglet by tonight.

435
00:31:47,291 --> 00:31:48,875
I want that microchip, no matter what.

436
00:31:48,958 --> 00:31:50,291
Go.

437
00:31:50,583 --> 00:31:51,458
Go.

438
00:31:54,833 --> 00:31:56,208
Hi, sir. It's Abhishek.

439
00:31:56,958 --> 00:31:59,958
-Oh, God!
-What is it? Who is on the phone?

440
00:32:00,041 --> 00:32:02,291
It's him, the guy who has negative energy.

441
00:32:02,541 --> 00:32:03,416
Give it to me.

442
00:32:04,416 --> 00:32:06,250
Hi, ma'am. It's Abhishek. Where is Raji?

443
00:32:06,375 --> 00:32:08,791
She went out. She left her phone at home.
She'll be back shortly.

444
00:32:08,875 --> 00:32:10,125
Okay, ma'am. I'm going there.

445
00:32:10,625 --> 00:32:11,500
What was he saying?

446
00:32:11,583 --> 00:32:13,708
-He is coming here.
-Oh, God! Let's get out of here.

447
00:32:14,041 --> 00:32:15,250
Let's go.

448
00:32:15,416 --> 00:32:17,583
Drop me off at my sister's place
then go wherever you want to.

449
00:32:21,916 --> 00:32:26,708
Dude, how will you convince Raji
that you sent a dog and not a pig?

450
00:32:27,125 --> 00:32:28,083
Hey!

451
00:32:28,833 --> 00:32:29,708
Excuse me?

452
00:32:31,083 --> 00:32:32,416
Is there a piglet in that box?

453
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,375
Yes, why?

454
00:32:33,458 --> 00:32:35,416
It's ours. It was sent to you by mistake.

455
00:32:35,708 --> 00:32:37,791
-Oh, so have our dog?
-Yes.

456
00:32:37,875 --> 00:32:39,541
-Where is the dog?
-It ran away.

457
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:42,208
How can you say that so easily?
That dog cost me 20,000 rupees.

458
00:32:42,333 --> 00:32:43,375
Give us that box.

459
00:32:43,458 --> 00:32:45,333
Give us our dog and take your piglet.

460
00:32:55,041 --> 00:32:55,916
Let go!

461
00:33:02,708 --> 00:33:03,583
Abhi...

462
00:33:03,958 --> 00:33:04,875
Abhishek...

463
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:16,000
<span style="style.default_1">-Come closer, come closer</span>
-Be careful.

464
00:33:16,083 --> 00:33:17,750
<span style="style.default_1">Can you come closer?</span>

465
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:23,791
<span style="style.default_1">Come closer, come closer</span>

466
00:33:23,875 --> 00:33:25,541
-Abhishek.
-<span style="style.default_1">Can you come closer?</span>

467
00:33:25,625 --> 00:33:28,166
<span style="style.default_1">Come closer, come closer</span>

468
00:33:34,125 --> 00:33:40,125
<span style="style.default_1">Come closer, come closer
Can you come closer?</span>

469
00:34:02,625 --> 00:34:03,708
-Abhishek!
-Let's go.

470
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:05,708
-Abhishek!
-Out of the way.

471
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:07,166
Come, let's move.

472
00:34:19,333 --> 00:34:20,500
You copied the signatures well.

473
00:34:20,583 --> 00:34:22,125
You have to copy 150 signatures
by tomorrow.

474
00:34:30,333 --> 00:34:31,500
Hey, idiot!

475
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,333
"Hey, idiot!"

476
00:34:33,541 --> 00:34:34,375
Raji.

477
00:34:34,458 --> 00:34:36,208
You stupid fellow!

478
00:34:36,291 --> 00:34:37,583
"You stupid fellow!"

479
00:34:38,291 --> 00:34:41,416
It seems you've run away
with someone's piglet.

480
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:44,458
"It seems you've run away
with someone's piglet."

481
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:46,666
They want it back.

482
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:48,958
"They want it back."

483
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:50,833
If not, Shakti...

484
00:34:50,916 --> 00:34:52,083
"If not, Shakti..."

485
00:34:52,166 --> 00:34:53,000
Hey...

486
00:34:53,208 --> 00:34:54,041
Raji.

487
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:55,583
The name is Six Pack Shakti!

488
00:34:55,708 --> 00:34:57,250
Hey, relax!

489
00:34:57,791 --> 00:35:01,125
If not, Shakti will gouge my eyes out

490
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:03,375
and feed them to you.

491
00:35:04,125 --> 00:35:07,791
"If not, Shakti will gouge my eyes out

492
00:35:08,291 --> 00:35:10,416
and feed them to you."

493
00:35:12,916 --> 00:35:13,875
Don't cry.

494
00:35:16,625 --> 00:35:17,625
<span style="style.default_1">Raji.</span>

495
00:35:18,208 --> 00:35:19,583
<span style="style.default_1">Raji!</span>

496
00:35:20,291 --> 00:35:21,500
-<span style="style.default_1">Raji!</span>
-Listen.

497
00:35:22,208 --> 00:35:24,291
You better bring the piglet here

498
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:26,125
or else...

499
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:27,291
Raji!

500
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,250
Raji!

501
00:35:29,583 --> 00:35:30,458
Hey!

502
00:35:30,666 --> 00:35:33,291
If something happens to Raji,
I'll throw this piglet under a truck.

503
00:35:33,375 --> 00:35:34,958
Where are you?

504
00:35:37,125 --> 00:35:38,875
-At Gowliguda Intersection.
-Stay there.

505
00:35:38,958 --> 00:35:40,000
<span style="style.default_1">My guys will bring her there.</span>

506
00:35:40,083 --> 00:35:41,208
Hand over the piglet to them.

507
00:35:41,291 --> 00:35:43,166
If you try to act smart, she will...

508
00:35:44,166 --> 00:35:45,166
Abhi...

509
00:35:46,125 --> 00:35:47,166
Don't cry.

510
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:48,125
Abhi...

511
00:35:51,333 --> 00:35:52,958
-Please put the call on video mode.
<span style="style.default_1">-Abhi...</span>

512
00:36:15,708 --> 00:36:18,916
<span style="style.default_1">You are so special to me</span>

513
00:36:19,083 --> 00:36:22,333
<span style="style.default_1">Your smile is special too</span>

514
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:25,666
<span style="style.default_1">What am I without you?</span>

515
00:36:25,916 --> 00:36:29,125
<span style="style.default_1">Being with you is so special</span>

516
00:36:29,875 --> 00:36:33,250
<span style="style.default_1">Like a night with a full moon
Like a night full of stars</span>

517
00:36:33,333 --> 00:36:36,583
<span style="style.default_1">Like a courtyard filled with flowers
You are very special</span>

518
00:36:36,666 --> 00:36:41,833
<span style="style.default_1">Like an early morning light
Like a wonderful wakeup call</span>

519
00:36:41,916 --> 00:36:43,500
<span style="style.default_1">You are special</span>

520
00:36:43,625 --> 00:36:46,416
<span style="style.default_1">Raji</span>

521
00:36:46,958 --> 00:36:48,375
<span style="style.default_1">Raji</span>

522
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:51,958
<span style="style.default_1">My Raji</span>

523
00:36:53,833 --> 00:36:56,916
<span style="style.default_1">Your beauty is really special</span>

524
00:36:57,291 --> 00:37:00,375
<span style="style.default_1">Your anger is also special</span>

525
00:37:00,708 --> 00:37:02,041
<span style="style.default_1">Raji</span>

526
00:37:03,958 --> 00:37:05,500
<span style="style.default_1">My Raji</span>

527
00:37:24,708 --> 00:37:28,041
<span style="style.default_1">I'm not suitable for you in any way</span>

528
00:37:28,125 --> 00:37:31,541
<span style="style.default_1">I'm not fit to be your toenail either</span>

529
00:37:31,625 --> 00:37:34,916
<span style="style.default_1">I can never forget you</span>

530
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,416
<span style="style.default_1">I will never let you go
Not even in the lifetimes to come</span>

531
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:41,833
<span style="style.default_1">Like a warm breath
Like a heart's first beat</span>

532
00:37:41,916 --> 00:37:45,250
<span style="style.default_1">Like some harmless mischief
You are special</span>

533
00:37:45,333 --> 00:37:48,041
<span style="style.default_1">Raji</span>

534
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:50,166
<span style="style.default_1">Raji</span>

535
00:37:51,958 --> 00:37:53,583
<span style="style.default_1">My Raji</span>

536
00:37:55,583 --> 00:37:58,625
<span style="style.default_1">Your slim waist is so special</span>

537
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,208
<span style="style.default_1">Your round eyes are so special</span>

538
00:38:02,375 --> 00:38:03,833
<span style="style.default_1">Raji</span>

539
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:07,291
<span style="style.default_1">My Raji</span>

540
00:38:28,125 --> 00:38:31,500
<span style="style.default_1">Unknowingly, I have made a mistake</span>

541
00:38:31,583 --> 00:38:34,833
<span style="style.default_1">I have hurt you a lot</span>

542
00:38:35,041 --> 00:38:38,125
<span style="style.default_1">I apologize to you
And I punish myself for it</span>

543
00:38:38,208 --> 00:38:41,750
<span style="style.default_1">If you give me a chance, I'll mend my ways</span>

544
00:38:41,875 --> 00:38:45,250
<span style="style.default_1">Like a flashing firefly
Like the chime of a temple bell</span>

545
00:38:45,333 --> 00:38:48,666
<span style="style.default_1">Like the sound of the waves
You are special</span>

546
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:51,000
<span style="style.default_1">Raji</span>

547
00:38:52,041 --> 00:38:53,541
<span style="style.default_1">Raji</span>

548
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:57,083
<span style="style.default_1">My Raji</span>

549
00:39:15,166 --> 00:39:17,875
Drop the girl off and bring the piglet.

550
00:39:17,958 --> 00:39:18,791
Boss.

551
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:21,125
What?

552
00:39:21,208 --> 00:39:22,916
Are we going to let her go?

553
00:39:23,041 --> 00:39:23,916
Why?

554
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,208
Nothing, boss.
I've just fallen in love with the girl.

555
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:32,166
I want to take her out for tea
and later take her to a disco.

556
00:39:35,166 --> 00:39:37,250
You will go to a disco with her?

557
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:38,458
Yes, boss.

558
00:39:49,541 --> 00:39:52,208
Why did you kill the poor guy?
What was so wrong about what he said?

559
00:39:54,958 --> 00:39:58,125
Can you imagine how the two of you
would have looked in a disco?

560
00:39:58,625 --> 00:39:59,583
Take her away.

561
00:40:00,208 --> 00:40:02,666
Mister, any news on Chanti?

562
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:06,208
None so far. He ran after that car.

563
00:40:06,291 --> 00:40:08,500
We don't know what happened to him.

564
00:40:11,333 --> 00:40:12,666
Kid, we have reached Hyderabad.

565
00:40:21,208 --> 00:40:23,291
-Why is it making noise?
-Just open the box and check.

566
00:40:25,333 --> 00:40:27,291
Hey, a baby pig! It's so cute.

567
00:40:28,625 --> 00:40:29,625
Why are you making noise?

568
00:40:30,625 --> 00:40:32,625
Hey, a piglet! It's so cute.

569
00:40:32,708 --> 00:40:33,541
Your baby?

570
00:40:36,291 --> 00:40:37,458
Does your cheek hurt?

571
00:40:37,833 --> 00:40:39,166
Maybe it's hungry.

572
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:41,000
-What should we give it?
-Will it drink milk?

573
00:40:41,125 --> 00:40:42,750
Idiot! Have you seen pigs drink milk?

574
00:40:42,833 --> 00:40:45,291
No, they drink alcohol like you
when they are hungry. Idiot!

575
00:40:45,833 --> 00:40:48,666
<span style="style.default_1">Take the phone, don't sleep...</span>

576
00:40:51,666 --> 00:40:53,500
His name is Gutka Gangaraju.

577
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,500
He controls the illegal tobacco trade
in the city.

578
00:40:59,708 --> 00:41:00,708
He is a hot-headed man.

579
00:41:04,083 --> 00:41:05,166
You stupid man!

580
00:41:07,083 --> 00:41:09,000
-Okay.
-Please help me, sir.

581
00:41:10,375 --> 00:41:12,250
-Where is Pandu?
-What will I get with one rupee, sir?

582
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:14,916
Oh, no!

583
00:41:15,583 --> 00:41:16,875
I told you not to chew tobacco, sir.

584
00:41:18,625 --> 00:41:21,333
The several murder cases against him
have forced him to control his temper.

585
00:41:22,166 --> 00:41:25,541
I don't care if you're Gutka Gangaraju
or Matka Mangaraju.

586
00:41:25,625 --> 00:41:27,208
I'll slap you with my slipper.

587
00:41:29,666 --> 00:41:32,208
Why are you chewing like a goat?
You bald goat.

588
00:41:32,708 --> 00:41:36,000
Why are you staring with those eyes?
Are you a bald owl?

589
00:41:36,583 --> 00:41:39,458
I'll gouge your eyes out.

590
00:41:41,083 --> 00:41:43,166
Why are you staring like...

591
00:41:44,333 --> 00:41:48,416
You think you're superior just because
you have a few punks by your side?

592
00:41:49,333 --> 00:41:52,958
You're mad, stupid, useless,
and an ass, baldy!

593
00:41:53,041 --> 00:41:57,333
You're like a cross-bred buffalo,
you useless piece of crap.

594
00:41:57,416 --> 00:42:00,750
You're like an ox. You're a bald ox.

595
00:42:07,208 --> 00:42:10,083
Sir, you didn't get angry
for two minutes today.

596
00:42:10,458 --> 00:42:11,458
Two minutes? Really?

597
00:42:11,541 --> 00:42:14,083
Yes, sir!
That's thirty seconds more than yesterday.

598
00:42:14,166 --> 00:42:15,000
What do you say, guys?

599
00:42:15,083 --> 00:42:17,208
-Good job.
-You're great, boss.

600
00:42:17,291 --> 00:42:18,291
You're fantastic, boss.

601
00:42:18,708 --> 00:42:21,375
Every time you get angry,
just let me insult you.

602
00:42:21,458 --> 00:42:25,083
Your tolerance will increase,
and you will become more composed.

603
00:42:25,208 --> 00:42:27,750
Fine, stay with me
and help me become more composed.

604
00:42:27,833 --> 00:42:28,666
Okay, sir.

605
00:42:30,833 --> 00:42:33,041
Gangaraju's biggest enemy
is not his temper.

606
00:42:33,416 --> 00:42:35,000
It's this guy, Sharjah Shankar.

607
00:42:35,125 --> 00:42:37,916
His primary business is supplying girls
to Sheikhs in Arab countries.

608
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,500
-Hello, sir.
-<span style="style.default_1">What's happening, Shankar?</span>

609
00:42:39,583 --> 00:42:43,291
<span style="style.default_1">You've taken a lot of money,
but haven't sent me a girl yet.</span>

610
00:42:43,375 --> 00:42:45,250
There's been a problem
with the police at the airport.

611
00:42:45,333 --> 00:42:48,250
<span style="style.default_1">If you keep giving me excuses,
I'll chop you up and bury you in Qatar.</span>

612
00:42:48,333 --> 00:42:49,791
<span style="style.default_1">I'm coming to Hyderabad.</span>

613
00:42:49,875 --> 00:42:53,125
<span style="style.default_1">If you don't find me a girl,</span>

614
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:55,500
<span style="style.default_1">I'll get you married to a camel.</span>

615
00:42:56,625 --> 00:42:58,833
Guys, do something.
This guy will do what he says.

616
00:42:58,916 --> 00:43:02,125
Find a girl. How can I marry a camel?

617
00:43:04,625 --> 00:43:07,833
He thinks he is brave,
but he's very scared of his wife.

618
00:43:08,916 --> 00:43:10,333
-Dad.
-What is it, dear?

619
00:43:10,416 --> 00:43:12,416
There is a small get-together
at my school tomorrow.

620
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:14,541
-Who will be there?
-Just you, me, and the principal.

621
00:43:17,416 --> 00:43:19,833
Subbulu, didn't I tell you
not to call me when I'm at home?

622
00:43:19,916 --> 00:43:22,708
I'm not Subbulu.
I'm your wife, you filthy idiot.

623
00:43:29,083 --> 00:43:30,708
Subbulu! I thought
it was my wife calling me.

624
00:43:30,791 --> 00:43:32,666
It's still your wife.

625
00:43:33,125 --> 00:43:37,208
-You want Subbulu?
-Please don't hit me.

626
00:43:37,291 --> 00:43:40,750
Did you go to a movie with her?
Why can't you go with me?

627
00:43:40,833 --> 00:43:42,666
It's not a family film.

628
00:43:42,791 --> 00:43:45,958
You dirty rascal.
You think I'm ugly, don't you?

629
00:43:46,041 --> 00:43:48,416
-Your friend praised me when he came here.
-What did he say?

630
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:52,625
That I was shining brightly
like a freshly washed dish.

631
00:43:52,708 --> 00:43:53,875
My friend Subhramanyam?

632
00:43:54,625 --> 00:43:55,916
Yes, you rascal.

633
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,125
Why do you believe him?
He is a scrap dealer.

634
00:43:58,208 --> 00:44:00,291
What kind of dealer are you, you rascal?

635
00:44:00,875 --> 00:44:05,541
We've managed to shut down
all forms of gambling in this town.

636
00:44:05,666 --> 00:44:08,541
But thugs keep finding new ways to gamble.

637
00:44:08,791 --> 00:44:11,333
The latest fad is animal racing,

638
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:12,958
races where the participants are animals.

639
00:44:13,041 --> 00:44:14,875
Gangaraju and Shankar
gamble with really high stakes,

640
00:44:14,958 --> 00:44:16,583
and bring a sort of glamor to the races.

641
00:44:19,333 --> 00:44:20,291
ANIMAL PREDICTION

642
00:44:22,416 --> 00:44:23,458
ANIMAL PREDICTION HANDBOOK

643
00:44:23,541 --> 00:44:26,875
A white cat with black ears
will win this race.

644
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:29,166
Yes, Daamu.

645
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:31,875
A white cat with black ears, boss.

646
00:44:34,375 --> 00:44:35,791
-Where is this priest?
-There he is.

647
00:44:37,666 --> 00:44:40,500
I've told Gangaraju
that it's a white cat with black ears.

648
00:44:40,666 --> 00:44:42,916
Shankar is bound to find out.

649
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,416
Sell it to him for 50 and pay me 20.

650
00:44:45,625 --> 00:44:46,500
Okay, sir.

651
00:44:57,041 --> 00:44:58,041
-Thanks, dude.
-Bye, man.

652
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:00,916
Boss, I found the cat.

653
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:01,875
Get in.

654
00:45:05,125 --> 00:45:08,208
Good job on finding the cat, Suri.

655
00:45:08,291 --> 00:45:09,250
Take it, boss.

656
00:45:13,625 --> 00:45:14,500
Yes, boss?

657
00:45:14,583 --> 00:45:17,125
How did he manage
to get a white cat with black ears?

658
00:45:18,458 --> 00:45:19,916
Did anyone leak the information?

659
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,541
His priest must have told him
the same thing.

660
00:45:22,625 --> 00:45:24,375
Priests can change,
but the scriptures can't.

661
00:45:25,333 --> 00:45:28,583
Did his priest tell him that
or was it from our priest?

662
00:45:29,208 --> 00:45:31,708
The cat race has started.
The cats are running with a lot of energy.

663
00:45:31,791 --> 00:45:34,291
Shankar's cat is leading.
Gangaraju's cat is behind it.

664
00:45:34,375 --> 00:45:36,458
Other cats are trying to catch up.

665
00:45:36,541 --> 00:45:38,916
Gangaraju's cat is probably
good at catching rats.

666
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,833
That must be why Gangaraju's cat
has overtaken Shankar's cat.

667
00:45:41,916 --> 00:45:44,375
-Shankar's cat is giving a good fight.
-Come on!

668
00:45:44,541 --> 00:45:49,125
But Gangaraju's cat is racing ahead
with so much confidence.

669
00:45:49,208 --> 00:45:51,333
Finally, we're at the finish line, and...

670
00:45:51,416 --> 00:45:54,333
Gangaraju's cat wins!

671
00:45:58,750 --> 00:45:59,625
Damn!

672
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:13,208
Boss, there's ink on the cat ears.
Suri has cheated us.

673
00:46:13,625 --> 00:46:17,833
-Suri, you cheat! How dare you cheat me!
-Sir...

674
00:46:17,916 --> 00:46:19,625
Hey, get him and kill him.

675
00:46:20,125 --> 00:46:21,458
Finish him.

676
00:46:23,041 --> 00:46:27,250
The next race is at 5:00 p.m.
on the third Sunday of next month.

677
00:46:27,375 --> 00:46:29,500
The piglet should not be more
than six kilos in weight

678
00:46:29,583 --> 00:46:31,833
and 12 inches in height.

679
00:46:32,041 --> 00:46:34,833
-I'll take care of you in the next race.
-Give the betting amount

680
00:46:34,916 --> 00:46:36,250
-within the next 24 hours.
-Get lost.

681
00:46:37,166 --> 00:46:40,291
As said in the unconfirmed information,
the race is scheduled for 5:00 p.m. today.

682
00:46:40,375 --> 00:46:42,208
It will take place somewhere in the city.

683
00:46:42,333 --> 00:46:43,666
An angle adjacent to the other angle.

684
00:46:44,416 --> 00:46:46,041
An angle opposite the other angle.

685
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:50,333
Black spots.
A triangle made by three spots.

686
00:46:51,333 --> 00:46:54,791
A white piglet with three spots
in a triangular formation on its belly

687
00:46:54,875 --> 00:46:56,041
will win the race.

688
00:46:57,708 --> 00:47:00,541
Boss, why did you kill the priest?

689
00:47:01,583 --> 00:47:03,375
I don't want him to leak the information.

690
00:47:09,333 --> 00:47:12,958
Mr. Shankar, a white piglet
with three black spots on its belly.

691
00:47:13,625 --> 00:47:16,583
<span style="style.default_1">Believing in the priest's
bogus prediction,</span>

692
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:22,000
<span style="style.default_1">Shankar and Gangaraju's goons
started searching for such a piglet</span>

693
00:47:22,125 --> 00:47:27,291
<span style="style.default_1">in the pig farms of the two states.</span>

694
00:47:29,166 --> 00:47:31,125
-We want a white piglet.
-Check the pigs out.

695
00:47:31,291 --> 00:47:33,250
It should have three black spots
on its belly.

696
00:47:33,333 --> 00:47:34,750
We don't have one like that.

697
00:47:34,833 --> 00:47:36,833
-If you see something like that, call me.
-Sure.

698
00:47:37,375 --> 00:47:39,375
We only have one clue in this case.

699
00:47:39,458 --> 00:47:41,375
The key master, Kumar,
is in charge of the prize money.

700
00:47:41,458 --> 00:47:43,791
The prize money is kept in a locker
in one of the city's banks.

701
00:47:43,875 --> 00:47:45,458
<span style="style.default_1">He has the locker's key.</span>

702
00:47:45,583 --> 00:47:47,833
<span style="style.default_1">He will give the key to the winner.</span>

703
00:47:49,291 --> 00:47:52,875
He left Bombay last night
and landed in Hyderabad.

704
00:47:53,125 --> 00:47:56,500
If we manage to capture him,
we can stop the race.

705
00:47:56,833 --> 00:47:57,791
Mr. S.N. Reddy.

706
00:47:59,708 --> 00:48:00,833
The race should not take place.

707
00:48:07,375 --> 00:48:10,625
<span style="style.default_1">Boss, the piglet
is at Gowliguda Intersection.</span>

708
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:12,541
Abbulu. Mastan.

709
00:48:12,666 --> 00:48:13,500
Daamu.

710
00:48:13,583 --> 00:48:15,333
-Daamu. Abbulu.
-Yes, boss?

711
00:48:15,416 --> 00:48:17,083
-We found the piglet.
-Where, boss?

712
00:48:17,166 --> 00:48:18,666
At Gowliguda Intersection. Where's Abbulu?

713
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:21,541
He's gone to the store to buy some sugar.

714
00:48:21,958 --> 00:48:22,791
Where is Narsingh?

715
00:48:22,875 --> 00:48:26,333
He's gone to the tailor
to get his wife's skirt fixed.

716
00:48:27,416 --> 00:48:30,083
What kind of goons are you?
I'll kill you all.

717
00:48:30,375 --> 00:48:34,208
Gangaraju, how many times have I told you
not to get angry?

718
00:48:34,291 --> 00:48:38,375
You stupid baldy.
I'll break your head open like a pumpkin.

719
00:48:38,458 --> 00:48:40,458
I'll break your legs and burn them.

720
00:48:40,541 --> 00:48:43,416
Bloody donkey, bear, rhinoceros,
hippopotamus, you dog with rabies...

721
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:45,583
-If I kick you, you'll puke out...
-Yadagiri, where are you?

722
00:48:49,375 --> 00:48:52,291
-Daamu.
-The piglet is at Gowliguda Intersection.

723
00:48:58,833 --> 00:48:59,833
Drink, piggy.

724
00:49:00,125 --> 00:49:02,583
-Drink some milk. Drink, piggy.
-Hey.

725
00:49:02,666 --> 00:49:05,250
-Hey, who are these guys?
-Stop!

726
00:49:05,333 --> 00:49:06,333
-Stop!
-Hey!

727
00:49:06,666 --> 00:49:07,583
Hey, stop!

728
00:49:08,208 --> 00:49:10,500
They look like Shankar's goons.

729
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,541
Some other guys took the piglet.

730
00:49:22,333 --> 00:49:23,833
There it is.

731
00:49:36,708 --> 00:49:37,583
There!

732
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:41,541
Hey, there!

733
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:25,166
Hey, stop.

734
00:50:25,666 --> 00:50:26,500
Stop.

735
00:50:27,666 --> 00:50:28,541
Hey, stop.

736
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,083
Catch it.

737
00:51:17,166 --> 00:51:19,041
Don't spit on me, boss.

738
00:51:19,125 --> 00:51:21,333
My wife has a hard time
washing out the stains.

739
00:51:21,416 --> 00:51:23,666
What did you say? Where is my gun?

740
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:27,083
Gangaraju, I told you not to get angry.

741
00:51:27,166 --> 00:51:29,541
You fool. I'll fix you. Wait.

742
00:51:35,458 --> 00:51:36,541
It's swollen. Just stop.

743
00:51:39,208 --> 00:51:40,125
Catch it!

744
00:51:41,708 --> 00:51:42,583
Hey, catch it.

745
00:51:46,916 --> 00:51:48,250
Let's go. Run.

746
00:51:52,541 --> 00:51:54,291
Who is beating up our guys?

747
00:51:54,375 --> 00:51:56,666
Looks like he is a friend of the guy
who ran away with the piglet.

748
00:52:09,541 --> 00:52:10,416
Abhi.

749
00:52:11,833 --> 00:52:12,750
Hey, stop.

750
00:52:14,416 --> 00:52:15,625
-Abhi!
-Hey.

751
00:52:19,208 --> 00:52:20,833
-Let go of Raji.
-Give us the piglet.

752
00:52:21,458 --> 00:52:22,458
Set Raji free first.

753
00:52:22,541 --> 00:52:24,375
I'm warning you, give us the piglet.

754
00:52:24,625 --> 00:52:26,833
-Boss. Yes, boss.
-Are they Shakti's men?

755
00:52:26,916 --> 00:52:28,958
Last warning. Hand over the piglet.

756
00:52:29,041 --> 00:52:30,958
And I'm warning you. Let go of Raji.

757
00:52:31,041 --> 00:52:32,916
-Who's that guy with the piglet?
-We don't know, boss.

758
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,583
-And the girl?
-It looks like she's his girl.

759
00:52:34,666 --> 00:52:36,791
They are trying
to exchange the piglet for the girl.

760
00:52:36,875 --> 00:52:38,125
Let go of Raji.

761
00:52:38,208 --> 00:52:39,333
Why are we even discussing this?

762
00:52:40,708 --> 00:52:41,750
Catch him.

763
00:52:41,833 --> 00:52:42,750
Hey, stop.

764
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:50,916
And who are you?

765
00:52:53,708 --> 00:52:54,833
Shakti.

766
00:53:02,916 --> 00:53:04,791
Did everyone run away
after seeing the cops, Daddy?

767
00:53:04,875 --> 00:53:05,750
They ran away.

768
00:53:05,833 --> 00:53:08,041
But in order to make Abhishek
bring the piglet,

769
00:53:08,125 --> 00:53:09,958
<span style="style.default_1">Gangaraju kidnapped his friend Tulsi.</span>

770
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,083
Hey.

771
00:53:14,208 --> 00:53:15,083
Hey!

772
00:53:17,166 --> 00:53:20,041
<span style="style.default_1">With the same plan in mind,
Shankar kidnapped Raji.</span>

773
00:53:20,916 --> 00:53:21,833
Hey, move.

774
00:53:22,083 --> 00:53:23,000
Let me go!

775
00:53:34,208 --> 00:53:35,041
Stop.

776
00:53:39,125 --> 00:53:41,416
Are you mad? You could have died.

777
00:54:13,166 --> 00:54:17,166
Abhi, if you don't bring the piglet here,
these guys will kill me.

778
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:18,083
Who are they?

779
00:54:18,291 --> 00:54:19,791
Wait, Raji is calling.

780
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:21,375
-Abhi...
-<span style="style.default_1">Raji.</span>

781
00:54:21,458 --> 00:54:22,416
Who are all these people?

782
00:54:22,666 --> 00:54:23,625
Raji!

783
00:54:24,791 --> 00:54:27,333
<span style="style.default_1">If you don't bring the piglet here,</span>

784
00:54:27,416 --> 00:54:31,583
your girl will be dressed up
and shipped off to Sharjah Sheikh.

785
00:54:31,666 --> 00:54:33,000
<span style="style.default_1">And she will get married there.</span>

786
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:35,916
And then there will be consummation.

787
00:54:36,541 --> 00:54:38,458
If something happens to Raji, I'll...

788
00:54:43,083 --> 00:54:44,875
-Yes.
-Suri, where are you?

789
00:54:45,083 --> 00:54:45,916
What happened?

790
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,791
-Do you know where Shakti is?
-Yes, hop on.

791
00:54:48,208 --> 00:54:49,041
Let's go.

792
00:55:24,583 --> 00:55:25,791
Shakti's den is there. Upstairs.

793
00:55:29,125 --> 00:55:30,000
That way.

794
00:56:28,250 --> 00:56:30,041
-Abhi...
-Raji.

795
00:56:30,125 --> 00:56:32,833
We've selected this dress for her wedding,
and this dress for her first night.

796
00:56:32,916 --> 00:56:35,041
-How do they look?
-There is no dress. It's just a hanger!

797
00:56:35,125 --> 00:56:36,875
Who wears a dress
on the first night, you fool?

798
00:56:37,333 --> 00:56:39,166
She refuses to try this on.

799
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:42,541
If she continues to be difficult,
my boys will have to do it for her.

800
00:56:42,625 --> 00:56:43,958
Guys, remove her clothes!

801
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:45,875
Raji!

802
00:56:46,250 --> 00:56:47,250
What is this, dude?

803
00:56:47,333 --> 00:56:48,916
<span style="style.default_1">Let's go to Shankar's den.</span>

804
00:56:54,166 --> 00:56:55,041
Let's go.

805
00:56:56,458 --> 00:56:59,291
Ma'am, please give me two sweet potatoes.

806
00:57:06,250 --> 00:57:07,833
What do you do with these plates?

807
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,208
I earn ten rupees for a kilo of them. Eat!

808
00:57:13,583 --> 00:57:14,416
Eat!

809
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:16,875
Bunty likes sweet potatoes a lot.

810
00:57:17,125 --> 00:57:20,291
Do you think Bunty is still alive?

811
00:57:39,125 --> 00:57:40,125
Where is the microchip?

812
00:57:40,625 --> 00:57:41,541
Where is the microchip?

813
00:57:41,625 --> 00:57:42,458
We don't know, boss.

814
00:57:44,833 --> 00:57:47,958
Mister, how do I find the address
of a vehicle with this plate?

815
00:57:48,041 --> 00:57:49,916
Go and ask that traffic constable.

816
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Thanks, mister.

817
00:57:54,291 --> 00:57:55,791
-Oh, no!
-Chanti...

818
00:57:56,208 --> 00:57:57,083
Chanti...

819
00:58:00,916 --> 00:58:01,750
Get up.

820
00:58:15,416 --> 00:58:17,375
Boss, this doesn't look like a birthmark.

821
00:58:17,458 --> 00:58:19,791
It's a tattoo.
Look at how the color comes off.

822
00:58:20,375 --> 00:58:22,125
Who tattooed a piglet?

823
00:58:22,208 --> 00:58:23,291
Who did it, Daddy?

824
00:58:23,375 --> 00:58:25,833
Chintu and Pardhu. Two tattoo artists.

825
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,416
<span style="style.default_1">They're the fake priest's men.</span>

826
00:58:29,291 --> 00:58:31,708
-How does the priest get those ideas?
-Concentrate.

827
00:58:31,791 --> 00:58:34,541
You messed up the cat's ears last time.
Suri got caught.

828
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:37,916
Hey!

829
00:58:48,291 --> 00:58:52,666
The two piglets exchanged places
during the chase in Gowliguda.

830
00:58:52,875 --> 00:58:58,375
Since the tattooed piglet is dead,
the real one is still alive.

831
00:58:58,458 --> 00:58:59,541
You got the point.

832
00:59:02,208 --> 00:59:04,750
Chanti, it fell into the drain.
We can't get it back.

833
00:59:05,166 --> 00:59:07,875
Do you at least remember
the number on the plate?

834
00:59:11,583 --> 00:59:12,750
What do we do now?

835
00:59:52,875 --> 00:59:54,208
That number plate is mine, sir.

836
00:59:54,416 --> 00:59:56,125
Anything I find inside the drain is mine.

837
00:59:56,958 --> 00:59:57,833
Please give it to me.

838
00:59:57,916 --> 00:59:59,958
Didn't you hear me?
Anything I find in the drain is mine.

839
01:00:00,916 --> 01:00:02,791
I won't be able to find Bunty without it.

840
01:00:06,333 --> 01:00:08,166
Okay, give me 1,000 rupees
and this will be yours.

841
01:00:08,250 --> 01:00:09,916
I don't have that much money, sir.

842
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,125
Then get lost.

843
01:00:11,750 --> 01:00:13,791
Give me the number plate, sir.

844
01:00:13,875 --> 01:00:15,458
-Leave me alone.
-Please, give it.

845
01:00:15,541 --> 01:00:17,041
-Please give it to me.
-Leave me alone.

846
01:00:19,333 --> 01:00:20,166
Chanti?

847
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:22,250
Chanti.

848
01:00:22,333 --> 01:00:25,083
You're trying to steal my stuff?
In my drain?

849
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,375
Sir, please.

850
01:00:35,583 --> 01:00:36,416
Let's go.

851
01:00:38,791 --> 01:00:42,041
What idiot would open the cover?

852
01:00:55,875 --> 01:00:59,458
Gangaraju and Shankar
are fighting over the same piglet.

853
01:00:59,833 --> 01:01:02,000
Do they know about the microchip or not?

854
01:01:02,875 --> 01:01:04,708
-Call them in for a meeting.
-Okay, boss.

855
01:01:05,916 --> 01:01:07,583
If this is the fake piglet,

856
01:01:10,583 --> 01:01:12,291
where is the original one?

857
01:01:58,333 --> 01:01:59,375
-Come.
-Take this.

858
01:02:15,750 --> 01:02:19,375
Sir, I need to find the address
of the vehicle with this plate.

859
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:22,833
Go to the RTA office over there
and ask them.

860
01:02:23,583 --> 01:02:24,500
Thanks, sir.

861
01:04:05,125 --> 01:04:06,625
-Where are you going?
-Borabanda.

862
01:04:35,291 --> 01:04:39,291
Hey, move.

863
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:45,458
This is Shankar's den.

864
01:04:45,541 --> 01:04:46,791
-Come on.
-I'm leaving.

865
01:04:46,875 --> 01:04:49,375
-If they see me, they'll kill me.
-Please help me, dude. Hey!

866
01:05:03,666 --> 01:05:04,541
Raji.

867
01:05:30,541 --> 01:05:33,208
Hey, a white piglet.
Where did you come from?

868
01:05:39,791 --> 01:05:45,208
We want a white piglet
with three spots on its belly.

869
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:00,083
Why did you want us
to meet you so urgently?

870
01:06:00,416 --> 01:06:02,083
All this time, we have been doing
our businesses

871
01:06:02,166 --> 01:06:03,333
without fighting each other.

872
01:06:04,041 --> 01:06:05,333
But now, there is a problem.

873
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:06,416
What is it?

874
01:06:07,333 --> 01:06:08,166
A piglet.

875
01:06:10,250 --> 01:06:11,750
I want a piglet.

876
01:06:12,375 --> 01:06:13,458
Not just any piglet,

877
01:06:14,458 --> 01:06:15,958
but a piglet
with three spots on its belly.

878
01:06:20,375 --> 01:06:21,958
I found the piglet you asked for, sir.

879
01:06:22,041 --> 01:06:24,208
-Does it have three spots on its belly?
-Yes, sir.

880
01:06:24,291 --> 01:06:26,875
I know you guys
are fighting over a piglet like that.

881
01:06:27,125 --> 01:06:28,625
I don't care about the piglet.

882
01:06:28,916 --> 01:06:32,250
But there is something in its belly
that's worth a lot of money.

883
01:06:34,791 --> 01:06:36,958
You guys can do
whatever you want with the piglet.

884
01:06:37,125 --> 01:06:39,041
But what's in its belly is mine.

885
01:06:39,125 --> 01:06:41,250
-I want her...
<span style="style.default_1">-Take the phone, don't sleep...</span>

886
01:06:41,666 --> 01:06:43,375
-Yes.
-We found the piglet, boss.

887
01:06:45,458 --> 01:06:46,875
Okay, I'll take care of it.

888
01:06:47,625 --> 01:06:49,375
Why fight each other?

889
01:06:49,750 --> 01:06:52,000
You will be the first person to know
if I find the piglet.

890
01:06:52,375 --> 01:06:53,250
See you.

891
01:06:58,750 --> 01:07:01,208
-The piglet has been located.
-I'll take care of it. Hang up.

892
01:07:02,541 --> 01:07:06,500
As soon as I find the piglet,
I'll bring it to you.

893
01:07:06,583 --> 01:07:07,416
See you.

894
01:07:15,708 --> 01:07:16,791
Here, sir. Take it.

895
01:07:16,875 --> 01:07:18,333
Hey, why is it screaming?

896
01:07:19,125 --> 01:07:22,375
Tie this string around its mouth
and put it in this bag.

897
01:07:25,166 --> 01:07:26,541
-Tie the string around its mouth.
-Okay.

898
01:07:27,250 --> 01:07:28,166
Tie it quickly.

899
01:07:28,250 --> 01:07:29,125
Hold it properly.

900
01:07:29,208 --> 01:07:31,000
-Hey, catch it.
-Catch it.

901
01:07:36,625 --> 01:07:37,458
That way.

902
01:08:18,583 --> 01:08:19,833
Just wait. I'll teach you a lesson.

903
01:08:29,333 --> 01:08:30,166
What happened?

904
01:08:30,541 --> 01:08:34,625
It came from that hole,
kissed me, and left.

905
01:08:56,291 --> 01:08:57,291
No!

906
01:08:57,958 --> 01:08:58,958
No!

907
01:09:55,750 --> 01:09:59,958
I'm Pandu. Hi, little piglet. Come to me.

908
01:10:01,541 --> 01:10:02,666
You're a good boy, aren't you?

909
01:10:03,333 --> 01:10:04,500
Come on.

910
01:10:10,875 --> 01:10:12,916
Come on, little guy. Come on.

911
01:11:01,958 --> 01:11:02,958
Chanti.

912
01:11:05,666 --> 01:11:06,833
Why are you so quiet?

913
01:11:07,375 --> 01:11:10,625
It's nothing. I saw a piglet by the road.
It was screaming.

914
01:11:11,041 --> 01:11:13,166
It sounded just like Bunty.

915
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:56,833
Where do you want to go in Borabanda?

916
01:11:57,416 --> 01:11:58,625
Take us to this address.

917
01:12:01,375 --> 01:12:02,708
Can you tell me where this address is?

918
01:12:11,291 --> 01:12:13,333
-Do you know the Borabanda Post Office?
-Yes.

919
01:12:13,416 --> 01:12:14,833
-It's the lane next to it.
-Thanks, sir.

920
01:12:37,916 --> 01:12:38,750
Raji.

921
01:12:39,583 --> 01:12:40,458
Abhi.

922
01:13:24,958 --> 01:13:25,791
Sir, we found him.

923
01:13:25,875 --> 01:13:27,208
The key master, Kumar, has been found.

924
01:13:28,583 --> 01:13:29,541
Where?

925
01:13:30,541 --> 01:13:31,458
Are you sure?

926
01:13:54,625 --> 01:13:55,458
Hey! Damn.

927
01:13:55,541 --> 01:13:56,416
Hey, thief!

928
01:13:57,833 --> 01:13:58,750
My suitcase!

929
01:14:01,583 --> 01:14:04,166
Abbulu, where is the piglet?

930
01:14:04,375 --> 01:14:06,291
You're a lucky man, boss.

931
01:14:06,375 --> 01:14:08,208
We had lost it, but we found it again.

932
01:14:08,291 --> 01:14:10,125
We have until 5:00 p.m.
to get to the race.

933
01:14:10,208 --> 01:14:13,208
There's something worth a lot of money
in its belly. We have to get it out.

934
01:14:13,291 --> 01:14:16,000
That's easy, boss.
We can take it out the front or the back.

935
01:14:16,083 --> 01:14:17,666
-How?
-When I was a kid,

936
01:14:17,750 --> 01:14:20,208
I swallowed a bottle cap.
They gave me castor oil to get it out.

937
01:14:20,291 --> 01:14:22,875
The bottle cap just flew out of me.

938
01:14:22,958 --> 01:14:25,125
What are you waiting for?
Make the piglet drink castor oil.

939
01:14:42,208 --> 01:14:46,208
You useless fellow.
I'm going to kill you tonight.

940
01:14:46,291 --> 01:14:47,875
Why? What have I done?

941
01:14:47,958 --> 01:14:49,625
You didn't attend
the parent-teacher meeting.

942
01:14:49,708 --> 01:14:51,125
What kind of father are you?

943
01:14:51,208 --> 01:14:52,250
What happened?

944
01:14:52,333 --> 01:14:54,916
They are kicking your son out of school.

945
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,208
-Why?
-Ask your son.

946
01:14:57,375 --> 01:15:01,125
Your stupid dad is on the phone.
Talk to him.

947
01:15:01,208 --> 01:15:02,916
-Hello, Dad.
-What happened?

948
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,416
My English teacher reported me
to the principal.

949
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:06,333
Why?

950
01:15:06,416 --> 01:15:09,125
She gave me zeroes in all my exams.
They look like eggs.

951
01:15:09,208 --> 01:15:11,541
Why? Does she think she is a chicken?

952
01:15:11,708 --> 01:15:13,375
I asked her the same question, Dad.

953
01:15:22,791 --> 01:15:26,000
My science teacher asked me
what soda we use to wash clothes.

954
01:15:26,083 --> 01:15:27,416
What did you say?

955
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:28,708
Washing soda.

956
01:15:28,791 --> 01:15:29,916
That's correct.

957
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,208
He asked what soda is used for cooking.

958
01:15:32,291 --> 01:15:33,208
What did you say?

959
01:15:33,291 --> 01:15:34,458
I said baking soda.

960
01:15:35,583 --> 01:15:37,958
He asked me what happens
when soda is mixed with water.

961
01:15:38,041 --> 01:15:40,416
Why does he want to mix soda
into everything? Is he a drunkard?

962
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:42,000
I asked him that too, Dad.

963
01:15:43,291 --> 01:15:45,291
It's been half an hour
since we made it drink castor oil.

964
01:15:45,375 --> 01:15:47,625
-Why isn't anything happening?
-His intestines must be stiff.

965
01:15:47,708 --> 01:15:49,750
Just wait until they loosen up,
then there will be a flood.

966
01:16:19,333 --> 01:16:22,041
-I'll kill you.
-Hey, Gangaraju.

967
01:16:22,125 --> 01:16:24,791
Why are you getting angry again?
I've told you many times not to get angry.

968
01:16:24,875 --> 01:16:28,000
I'll punch you in the stomach.
I'll pull out your intestines.

969
01:16:28,750 --> 01:16:31,208
Take that piglet to a veterinary hospital
and have it checked.

970
01:16:31,291 --> 01:16:33,041
Have it checked.

971
01:16:33,333 --> 01:16:36,541
I'm taking Raji and walking out of here.

972
01:16:36,875 --> 01:16:40,791
If you try to stop me,
I'll knock you down one by one.

973
01:16:40,958 --> 01:16:43,625
We won't fight you one by one.
We will fight together.

974
01:16:43,708 --> 01:16:44,666
What will you do, then?

975
01:16:44,750 --> 01:16:45,875
What will you do?

976
01:16:45,958 --> 01:16:47,166
I'm thinking.

977
01:16:47,750 --> 01:16:48,916
-Finish him.
-Yes!

978
01:16:51,625 --> 01:16:53,291
Catch him.

979
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:56,666
-Hey, come down!
-Catch him!

980
01:16:56,916 --> 01:16:58,125
-Abhi.
-Hey!

981
01:16:59,916 --> 01:17:02,041
Damn! We didn't make money out of Shankar.

982
01:17:02,208 --> 01:17:03,083
Don't worry.

983
01:17:04,250 --> 01:17:05,583
There is always a next time.

984
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:12,500
-Aren't those guys Gangaraju's goons?
-Yes.

985
01:17:15,541 --> 01:17:17,166
That looks like our piglet, man.

986
01:17:17,250 --> 01:17:18,083
Show me.

987
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:21,875
You heard that, moron?

988
01:17:21,958 --> 01:17:23,750
They will kick your son out of school.

989
01:17:23,833 --> 01:17:26,083
<span style="style.default_1">-Starting tomorrow, take him with you.</span>
-I have another call.

990
01:17:28,208 --> 01:17:29,125
Yes, Daamu.

991
01:17:29,208 --> 01:17:32,375
They've taken the piglet
to a veterinary hospital.

992
01:17:32,458 --> 01:17:33,375
Which veterinary hospital?

993
01:17:35,750 --> 01:17:38,166
The microchip is stuck in his intestines.

994
01:17:38,250 --> 01:17:39,666
Getting it out will take some time.

995
01:17:39,750 --> 01:17:40,708
How long will it take?

996
01:17:56,833 --> 01:17:57,750
Go back.

997
01:18:11,166 --> 01:18:12,791
Shankar shot at us

998
01:18:13,125 --> 01:18:15,333
and ran away with the piglet.

999
01:18:19,625 --> 01:18:21,000
This is the place.

1000
01:18:25,250 --> 01:18:27,083
That's the guy who took Bunty.

1001
01:18:27,208 --> 01:18:29,166
Hey, stop!

1002
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,291
Stop, man.

1003
01:18:41,458 --> 01:18:42,625
Stop.

1004
01:18:59,625 --> 01:19:00,791
How could we miss him?

1005
01:19:00,875 --> 01:19:04,166
We have to put Gangaraju and Shankar
in prison to stop the race from happening.

1006
01:19:08,750 --> 01:19:09,583
Search it.

1007
01:19:10,125 --> 01:19:11,000
Search it.

1008
01:19:11,875 --> 01:19:12,708
Come.

1009
01:19:13,291 --> 01:19:14,166
Stop.

1010
01:19:14,250 --> 01:19:15,250
Close the door.

1011
01:19:15,875 --> 01:19:17,958
Come on, open the door.

1012
01:19:19,666 --> 01:19:22,000
Hey, come down.

1013
01:19:22,375 --> 01:19:23,208
Abhi.

1014
01:19:23,291 --> 01:19:25,958
-Come down.
-Come down.

1015
01:19:27,958 --> 01:19:28,791
Abhi!

1016
01:19:28,875 --> 01:19:29,708
Abhi...

1017
01:19:47,750 --> 01:19:48,666
Break the door.

1018
01:19:49,625 --> 01:19:50,750
-Shankar!
-Come down.

1019
01:19:52,291 --> 01:19:53,166
Shankar!

1020
01:19:53,500 --> 01:19:55,250
Where is the fresh item?

1021
01:19:55,333 --> 01:19:56,375
Hey, beat them up.

1022
01:19:56,458 --> 01:19:58,958
-Hey.
-Sir, please.

1023
01:19:59,041 --> 01:20:00,666
Sir, no...

1024
01:20:00,833 --> 01:20:02,375
Sir.

1025
01:20:02,458 --> 01:20:03,791
Sir, please stop it, sir.

1026
01:20:04,083 --> 01:20:05,541
Your girl is over there.

1027
01:20:07,833 --> 01:20:11,666
<span style="style.default_1">A dessert from Afghanistan
My untrustworthy sweetheart</span>

1028
01:20:11,875 --> 01:20:13,958
<span style="style.default_1">I'm smitten by your love</span>

1029
01:20:14,041 --> 01:20:15,625
<span style="style.default_1">Oh, yes!</span>

1030
01:20:15,833 --> 01:20:19,708
<span style="style.default_1">Will you love me at gunpoint?</span>

1031
01:20:19,958 --> 01:20:22,041
<span style="style.default_1">At least show me your face</span>

1032
01:20:22,125 --> 01:20:23,916
<span style="style.default_1">Oh, yes!</span>

1033
01:20:24,291 --> 01:20:27,875
<span style="style.default_1">A dessert from Afghanistan
My untrustworthy sweetheart</span>

1034
01:20:28,208 --> 01:20:30,250
<span style="style.default_1">I'm smitten by your love</span>

1035
01:20:30,333 --> 01:20:32,041
<span style="style.default_1">Oh, yes!</span>

1036
01:20:32,125 --> 01:20:34,083
Come to me!

1037
01:20:36,791 --> 01:20:37,708
I'm dead.

1038
01:20:39,791 --> 01:20:41,625
-Sheikh.
-Abhi.

1039
01:20:41,708 --> 01:20:43,583
-Help the sheikh get up.
-Get him up.

1040
01:20:43,666 --> 01:20:44,833
-Get up.
-Sheikh.

1041
01:20:44,916 --> 01:20:46,583
-Sheikh...
-Sheikh, when did you arrive?

1042
01:20:49,958 --> 01:20:50,958
Boss, the police.

1043
01:20:52,250 --> 01:20:54,041
-Everybody, run!
-Boss, the police.

1044
01:20:58,083 --> 01:21:00,250
Hurry up. Get the carpet,
get the mattress.

1045
01:21:01,166 --> 01:21:02,000
Hurry up!

1046
01:21:02,083 --> 01:21:02,958
Go!

1047
01:21:03,041 --> 01:21:03,875
Go!

1048
01:21:12,750 --> 01:21:13,583
Come on.

1049
01:21:17,958 --> 01:21:20,041
Oh, no! Let's run.

1050
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:26,833
Bunty?

1051
01:21:28,166 --> 01:21:29,000
Bunty!

1052
01:21:30,375 --> 01:21:31,291
Bunty!

1053
01:21:37,208 --> 01:21:38,791
Stay here.

1054
01:22:06,958 --> 01:22:08,958
-Bunty!
-Bunty!

1055
01:22:11,208 --> 01:22:12,083
Come, Abhi.

1056
01:22:12,250 --> 01:22:13,125
Get up.

1057
01:22:16,416 --> 01:22:17,333
It's Shakti.

1058
01:22:46,125 --> 01:22:46,958
Come.

1059
01:23:09,291 --> 01:23:10,250
Bunty!

1060
01:23:13,833 --> 01:23:14,666
Bunty!

1061
01:23:19,250 --> 01:23:20,125
Bunty!

1062
01:23:29,791 --> 01:23:30,625
Bunty!

1063
01:23:31,375 --> 01:23:32,333
Bunty!

1064
01:23:32,500 --> 01:23:33,333
Bunty...

1065
01:23:39,166 --> 01:23:40,041
Where are you guys?

1066
01:23:42,375 --> 01:23:43,208
Bunty.

1067
01:23:44,833 --> 01:23:45,708
Bunty.

1068
01:23:46,375 --> 01:23:47,208
Bunty.

1069
01:23:48,791 --> 01:23:49,666
Bunty.

1070
01:23:51,583 --> 01:23:52,541
Bunty.

1071
01:23:54,375 --> 01:23:57,041
My God! He is going to kill the piglet.

1072
01:23:58,666 --> 01:23:59,958
Abhi, he is going to kill it.

1073
01:24:02,625 --> 01:24:04,125
Bunty.

1074
01:24:05,250 --> 01:24:07,916
Abhi, he is going to kill it.

1075
01:24:12,958 --> 01:24:13,875
Bunty.

1076
01:24:21,916 --> 01:24:23,458
Bunty.

1077
01:24:41,125 --> 01:24:42,000
Give me the piglet.

1078
01:24:42,083 --> 01:24:42,958
Give it.

1079
01:24:51,666 --> 01:24:53,166
-Give it to me.
-Hold it. Let's go.

1080
01:24:53,250 --> 01:24:54,125
Abhi.

1081
01:24:55,166 --> 01:24:56,333
Let's get out here. Hurry up!

1082
01:24:59,750 --> 01:25:00,625
Hurry up!

1083
01:25:01,666 --> 01:25:03,166
Mister, stop. Please.

1084
01:25:03,250 --> 01:25:05,833
Bunty is mine. Mister!

1085
01:25:05,916 --> 01:25:07,291
-Bunty is mine.
-Hey, who are you?

1086
01:25:07,375 --> 01:25:09,666
-Give him to me. He is mine.
-Who are you?

1087
01:25:09,750 --> 01:25:10,833
Please, sir. Give him to me.

1088
01:25:10,916 --> 01:25:14,500
-Bunty is mine. Please, mister.
-Hey, leave me alone.

1089
01:25:14,583 --> 01:25:15,708
-Get it!
-Bunty!

1090
01:25:15,791 --> 01:25:17,291
Sir, please sir, give him to me.

1091
01:25:17,375 --> 01:25:18,291
Bunty.

1092
01:25:18,375 --> 01:25:19,250
Bunty.

1093
01:25:19,333 --> 01:25:20,958
Please give him to me, mister.

1094
01:25:21,416 --> 01:25:22,333
Bunty.

1095
01:25:22,875 --> 01:25:24,583
Bunty.

1096
01:25:25,166 --> 01:25:26,291
It went in there, dude.

1097
01:25:26,541 --> 01:25:27,666
Mister, please.

1098
01:25:27,875 --> 01:25:29,083
Bunty.

1099
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:30,916
Bunty.

1100
01:25:31,166 --> 01:25:32,750
-Hey, catch the piglet.
-Bunty!

1101
01:25:32,916 --> 01:25:35,000
Bunty. Please, sir. Leave him, sir.

1102
01:25:35,250 --> 01:25:36,083
Bunty!

1103
01:25:36,166 --> 01:25:39,166
Please, mister. Let me go. Bunty!

1104
01:25:39,250 --> 01:25:40,333
Mister, please.

1105
01:25:41,625 --> 01:25:43,250
No, sir. Please, sir.

1106
01:25:43,416 --> 01:25:44,666
No, sir!

1107
01:25:45,583 --> 01:25:47,166
-Mister... Bunty!
-Catch it!

1108
01:25:48,666 --> 01:25:51,333
Please stop it, sir.

1109
01:25:53,625 --> 01:25:55,208
-Sir.
-Where is the piglet?

1110
01:25:56,625 --> 01:25:57,625
Hey, let go of my leg.

1111
01:25:59,125 --> 01:26:00,458
-Bunty!
-Let go!

1112
01:26:00,541 --> 01:26:01,500
Hey, careful.

1113
01:26:03,041 --> 01:26:04,541
-Chanti.
-Bunty.

1114
01:26:07,750 --> 01:26:08,958
Please, mister.

1115
01:26:10,625 --> 01:26:12,583
-Bunty!
-Hey.

1116
01:26:14,041 --> 01:26:15,500
-Look there.
-Bunty.

1117
01:26:15,791 --> 01:26:16,750
Bunty.

1118
01:26:17,083 --> 01:26:18,083
Hit him.

1119
01:26:18,500 --> 01:26:19,500
Bunty.

1120
01:26:20,583 --> 01:26:21,958
Police.

1121
01:26:23,041 --> 01:26:24,333
No, boss.

1122
01:26:24,916 --> 01:26:25,833
Freeze. Police.

1123
01:26:31,541 --> 01:26:32,833
Chanti, get up.

1124
01:26:44,541 --> 01:26:45,458
Bunty.

1125
01:26:45,750 --> 01:26:46,875
That's my Bunty.

1126
01:26:48,375 --> 01:26:49,875
Chanti!

1127
01:26:51,708 --> 01:26:53,250
That's my Bunty.

1128
01:27:03,333 --> 01:27:04,625
<span style="style.default_1">Durgaah!</span>

1129
01:27:04,833 --> 01:27:06,333
<span style="style.default_1">He's there!</span>

1130
01:27:06,416 --> 01:27:07,625
<span style="style.default_1">Durgaah!</span>

1131
01:27:07,708 --> 01:27:09,541
<span style="style.default_1">He's there!</span>

1132
01:27:11,666 --> 01:27:12,875
Where is the piglet?

1133
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:15,750
I knew we would find this piglet.

1134
01:27:15,833 --> 01:27:18,208
Boss, take this and forgive me
for my errors in the past.

1135
01:27:18,291 --> 01:27:19,500
Okay, Suri.

1136
01:27:22,916 --> 01:27:24,833
Tell me where the piglet is.

1137
01:27:24,916 --> 01:27:25,791
Raji.

1138
01:27:27,125 --> 01:27:28,166
-Raji.
-Abhi!

1139
01:27:28,250 --> 01:27:29,375
Tell me or she will die.

1140
01:27:29,458 --> 01:27:30,458
Where is Suri?

1141
01:27:35,125 --> 01:27:36,833
Mr. Durgaah, my name is Sharjah Shankar.

1142
01:27:37,541 --> 01:27:39,000
What you and Shakti are looking for

1143
01:27:39,083 --> 01:27:40,791
is in the belly of the piglet
that is with me.

1144
01:27:42,250 --> 01:27:44,750
Give me the correct price
and it will be yours.

1145
01:27:44,916 --> 01:27:46,791
<span style="style.default_1">If you want to talk about it,
come to this address.</span>

1146
01:27:48,833 --> 01:27:51,833
Boss, shall we get the doctor
to take the chip out of the piglet?

1147
01:27:51,916 --> 01:27:53,666
No. There's only half an hour left
before the race.

1148
01:27:53,750 --> 01:27:54,750
We'll take care of it later.

1149
01:27:54,958 --> 01:27:56,541
Doctor, give me the steroid injections.

1150
01:27:59,541 --> 01:28:03,041
Now, you will run the race like Superman.

1151
01:28:18,708 --> 01:28:20,041
We have new information, sir.

1152
01:28:20,250 --> 01:28:22,708
That bank locker key
has a GPS chip inside it.

1153
01:28:24,750 --> 01:28:26,458
People from the bank
are trying to locate it,

1154
01:28:26,541 --> 01:28:29,083
but the key is at an untraceable location.

1155
01:28:35,916 --> 01:28:36,916
We've located it.

1156
01:28:51,875 --> 01:28:55,000
To get a piglet with birthmarks,
one has to be lucky.

1157
01:28:55,125 --> 01:28:56,583
-What do you say, man?
-Yes, boss.

1158
01:28:56,666 --> 01:28:57,833
You are indeed lucky.

1159
01:28:58,583 --> 01:29:01,000
He doesn't have the piglet,
which means he is unlucky, right?

1160
01:29:01,083 --> 01:29:02,916
I'll kill you.

1161
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,333
Hey, Gangaraju. Why are you angry again?

1162
01:29:05,416 --> 01:29:08,166
How many times do I have to tell you?

1163
01:29:08,291 --> 01:29:10,583
-You stupid goon!
-Boss, don't worry.

1164
01:29:10,666 --> 01:29:12,750
Luck will certainly be in your favor.

1165
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:14,625
Our piglet is going the win the race.

1166
01:29:18,125 --> 01:29:21,833
The piglet race has started.
All the fat piglets have started running.

1167
01:29:21,916 --> 01:29:24,833
The piglets are rushing forward
with a lot of strength and speed.

1168
01:29:24,916 --> 01:29:27,791
The piglets are hurrying ahead
to jump over the fence.

1169
01:29:27,875 --> 01:29:32,166
They jumped over it
and are moving forward.

1170
01:29:32,416 --> 01:29:34,000
And the piglets...

1171
01:29:35,041 --> 01:29:36,041
Drink, Chanti.

1172
01:29:42,250 --> 01:29:43,833
-Bye, man. Thanks.
-Okay, call me later.

1173
01:29:46,500 --> 01:29:48,250
Mister, what did you do to Bunty?

1174
01:29:48,333 --> 01:29:50,000
-What did you do to him?
-Hey, leave me alone.

1175
01:29:50,083 --> 01:29:51,750
-I beg you, please tell me.
-Go away.

1176
01:29:51,833 --> 01:29:53,666
-Get lost.
-Mister, please tell me.

1177
01:29:53,750 --> 01:29:55,833
Now the piglets need to cross the pool.

1178
01:29:55,916 --> 01:29:59,291
They have easily crossed the pool
and are speeding ahead.

1179
01:29:59,375 --> 01:30:01,416
Shankar's piglet is racing ahead.

1180
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:03,416
Gangaraju's piglet is struggling
to catch up.

1181
01:30:03,500 --> 01:30:05,833
The other piglets are struggling
in the race.

1182
01:30:06,041 --> 01:30:09,458
Their fitness levels are low
due to their lack of exercise.

1183
01:30:09,541 --> 01:30:11,416
-I beg you.
-Mister, please take this money.

1184
01:30:11,500 --> 01:30:13,166
-What did you do to Bunty?
-Where's Bunty?

1185
01:30:13,250 --> 01:30:14,833
-I'll die if I don't find Bunty.
-Please, sir.

1186
01:30:14,916 --> 01:30:17,541
Shankar's piglet proves to be
a tough competitor.

1187
01:30:17,625 --> 01:30:19,916
It's making everyone anxious.

1188
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,208
Everyone is placing high bets
on the piglets.

1189
01:30:22,291 --> 01:30:25,291
They even crossed the holes
and are speeding ahead.

1190
01:30:26,833 --> 01:30:29,791
-Please tell me what you did to Bunty.
-Please take this money.

1191
01:30:29,875 --> 01:30:30,791
Hey, stop.

1192
01:30:31,875 --> 01:30:34,333
Shankar's piglet is racing ahead.

1193
01:30:34,416 --> 01:30:37,000
Gangaraju's piglet is struggling
to catch up.

1194
01:30:37,083 --> 01:30:39,958
The other piglets are running behind
Shankar and Gangaraju's piglets.

1195
01:30:40,041 --> 01:30:44,041
Everyone is excited about this race.
Everyone is tense.

1196
01:30:44,125 --> 01:30:48,166
Shankar's piglet is moving very fast
towards the finish line.

1197
01:30:48,250 --> 01:30:50,166
This is a trial by fire.

1198
01:30:50,250 --> 01:30:55,208
Shankar's piglet has jumped
through the fire.

1199
01:30:55,291 --> 01:30:59,666
Gangaraju's piglet and the other piglets
have jumped through the fire.

1200
01:31:04,083 --> 01:31:07,541
Shankar's piglet is about to win the race.

1201
01:31:07,625 --> 01:31:10,666
And Shankar's piglet wins!

1202
01:31:10,750 --> 01:31:11,666
Yes.

1203
01:31:13,125 --> 01:31:17,500
-Shankar's piglet wins.
-Boss, you are indeed lucky.

1204
01:31:17,583 --> 01:31:21,333
Yes. Do you think an animal race is
as easy as chewing tobacco?

1205
01:31:21,416 --> 01:31:25,458
Stop competing with me and sell
your tobacco at a discount.

1206
01:31:25,541 --> 01:31:27,083
Hey, what did you say?

1207
01:31:27,166 --> 01:31:31,625
Gangaraju, you stupid fellow.
I said to control your anger. Stupid!

1208
01:31:32,250 --> 01:31:34,791
How many times do I have to tell you
the same thing, you brainless fool?

1209
01:31:34,875 --> 01:31:38,375
-I will kill...
-Gangaraju has started firing at everyone.

1210
01:31:39,541 --> 01:31:40,875
There is madness everywhere.

1211
01:31:40,958 --> 01:31:43,166
Everybody is running around.

1212
01:31:43,250 --> 01:31:45,166
People are running faster
than the animals in the race.

1213
01:31:54,375 --> 01:31:56,083
I think the microchip
is still inside the piglet.

1214
01:31:56,500 --> 01:31:57,541
Take care of those guys.

1215
01:31:57,958 --> 01:32:00,791
Everybody is running.

1216
01:32:27,333 --> 01:32:28,750
Come here.

1217
01:32:29,208 --> 01:32:30,083
Come, piggy.

1218
01:32:31,291 --> 01:32:33,500
Come to me.

1219
01:32:33,791 --> 01:32:34,916
Come on.

1220
01:32:36,833 --> 01:32:38,458
Come, piggy.

1221
01:32:39,416 --> 01:32:40,916
Come here.

1222
01:33:03,333 --> 01:33:05,083
Piggy. No, piggy.

1223
01:33:21,916 --> 01:33:28,416
The piglets are running all over the place
and so are the humans.

1224
01:33:28,500 --> 01:33:30,291
There's confusion everywhere.

1225
01:33:45,958 --> 01:33:48,291
<span style="style.default_1">Did I give him
too many steroid injections?</span>

1226
01:34:16,625 --> 01:34:17,625
Hit him.

1227
01:34:18,666 --> 01:34:19,666
Bunty.

1228
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,708
It's raining bullets in here.

1229
01:36:01,833 --> 01:36:02,708
Bunty.

1230
01:36:05,625 --> 01:36:06,458
Bunty.

1231
01:36:08,250 --> 01:36:09,125
Bunty.

1232
01:36:11,041 --> 01:36:13,166
Bunty.

1233
01:36:13,416 --> 01:36:14,500
Bunty, open your eyes.

1234
01:36:14,916 --> 01:36:15,833
Bunty.

1235
01:36:16,166 --> 01:36:17,125
Bunty, open your eyes.

1236
01:36:17,250 --> 01:36:19,458
This looks like a war.

1237
01:36:21,833 --> 01:36:24,375
There's Shankar's gang on one side
and there's Gangaraju's on the other.

1238
01:36:24,458 --> 01:36:26,125
Nobody knows who's firing at whom.

1239
01:36:31,583 --> 01:36:33,166
Hey, leave me alone.

1240
01:36:38,333 --> 01:36:39,333
Let me go.

1241
01:36:43,791 --> 01:36:44,916
Abhishek!

1242
01:37:04,208 --> 01:37:05,041
Give me the chip.

1243
01:37:08,916 --> 01:37:10,833
Idiot, should we beat you up or thank you?

1244
01:37:31,666 --> 01:37:32,541
Oh, no.

1245
01:37:53,791 --> 01:37:54,708
Bunty.

1246
01:37:54,916 --> 01:37:55,875
Bunty.

1247
01:37:58,708 --> 01:37:59,625
Bunty.

1248
01:38:04,583 --> 01:38:06,250
<span style="style.default_1">Oh, way to go!</span>

1249
01:38:06,500 --> 01:38:08,791
Daddy, why are the end credits
appearing too soon?

1250
01:38:08,875 --> 01:38:11,791
What happened to Shakti
and all the other characters?

1251
01:38:11,875 --> 01:38:16,916
<span style="style.default_1">Shakti tried to escape
during the chaos, but...</span>

1252
01:38:20,166 --> 01:38:23,875
So, you will fry my wife's ear and eat it?

1253
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,666
From now on you will be known,
not as Six Pack Shakti,

1254
01:38:26,750 --> 01:38:28,000
but as No Ear Shakti.

1255
01:38:33,500 --> 01:38:36,250
<span style="style.default_1">The love story that became
a breakup story because of a dog,</span>

1256
01:38:36,333 --> 01:38:37,958

a piglet in it for a while,</span>

1257
01:38:38,083 --> 01:38:40,708

because of another dog.</span>

1258
01:38:47,041 --> 01:38:50,375
<span style="style.default_1">Though Benerjee
kept looking for positive energy,</span>

1259
01:38:50,458 --> 01:38:53,875
<span style="style.default_1">negative energy
continued to follow the poor man.</span>

1260
01:38:53,958 --> 01:38:55,125
Hello, Mr. Benerjee.

1261
01:38:55,375 --> 01:38:56,666
Hello, Mr. Ramesh. How are you?

1262
01:38:56,750 --> 01:38:58,500
-I'm good. Yes.
-Everyone is good?

1263
01:39:08,583 --> 01:39:12,375
<span style="style.default_1">The Sheikh who traveled with fruits
mattresses, pillows, and flowers</span>

1264
01:39:12,875 --> 01:39:17,416
<span style="style.default_1">continued to look for
fresh items in Hyderabad.</span>

1265
01:39:19,333 --> 01:39:21,833
Run! Run away!

1266
01:39:24,625 --> 01:39:27,541
-Run!
-Sheikh, shake me up.

1267
01:39:27,791 --> 01:39:30,041
<span style="style.default_1">After Sharjah Shankar's death,</span>

1268
01:39:30,125 --> 01:39:35,125
<span style="style.default_1">his wife married the scrap dealer,
Subhramanyam.</span>

1269
01:39:36,333 --> 01:39:38,583
You know, you look pretty,

1270
01:39:38,666 --> 01:39:40,958
like a metal plate
full of holes and dents.

1271
01:39:41,541 --> 01:39:45,458
<span style="style.default_1">After Gangaraju's death, his gang members
elected Daamu as their boss.</span>

1272
01:39:45,708 --> 01:39:49,541
<span style="style.default_1">The gang members started wearing
new clothes, but Daamu also...</span>

01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:59,125
<span style="style.default_1">The farmers who lost their lands
to Durgaah got their lands back.</span>

1274
01:39:59,208 --> 01:40:01,583
<span style="style.default_1">They donated the lands</span>

1275
01:40:01,666 --> 01:40:04,500
<span style="style.default_1">to the new capital city
and settled in comfortably.</span>

1276
01:40:06,041 --> 01:40:09,375
Did our hero settle down
with the money in the locker, Daddy?

1277
01:40:09,875 --> 01:40:11,666
How much money
do you think there is in the locker?

1278
01:40:11,750 --> 01:40:12,625
Maybe 100 million.

1279
01:40:12,916 --> 01:40:14,125
What will you do with the money?

1280
01:40:14,541 --> 01:40:16,416
Move the auto-rickshaw.

1281
01:40:30,833 --> 01:40:32,583
You were riding
with the Chief Minister's convoy?

1282
01:40:32,666 --> 01:40:34,625
We got him 1,000 acres of land
for the new capital city.

1283
01:40:34,708 --> 01:40:36,500
-It's the least they can do.
-I'm serious.

1284
01:40:36,583 --> 01:40:38,708
-What will you do with the money?
-Give your dad the dowry

1285
01:40:38,791 --> 01:40:39,708
so that I can marry you.

1286
01:40:57,125 --> 01:40:59,291
-Sir, please stop.
-Sir.

1287
01:40:59,375 --> 01:41:00,500
-Sir, stop!
-Sir.

1288
01:41:00,583 --> 01:41:02,291
Sir, please stop! Sir!

1289
01:41:02,375 --> 01:41:03,625
-Stop!
-Stop!

1290
01:41:04,041 --> 01:41:05,625
What happened to the piglet, Daddy?

1291
01:41:08,208 --> 01:41:11,458
Take these. One for you and one for Bunty.

1292
01:41:12,125 --> 01:41:13,041
Take them.

1293
01:41:37,541 --> 01:41:39,208
Hey, girl! Stop! What is this?

1294
01:41:39,583 --> 01:41:40,583
Hey, stop.

1295
01:41:41,208 --> 01:41:42,291
Stop!

1296
01:41:49,750 --> 01:41:51,041
Bunty, stop.

1297
01:41:51,666 --> 01:41:52,666
Stop.

1298
01:41:53,250 --> 01:41:54,583
Look at you. I'll hit you on the head.

1299
01:42:14,583 --> 01:42:18,250
So, Bunty went home.
And the story ends there.

1300
01:42:18,750 --> 01:42:21,041
Hey, fat guy, send that little guy over
to drink some milk.

1301
01:42:21,541 --> 01:42:23,041
Go and drink some milk.

1302
01:42:27,625 --> 01:42:29,125
I see. So, it was your story, Daddy.

1303
01:42:29,208 --> 01:42:30,208
Yes.

1304
01:42:30,291 --> 01:42:32,500
So you had this grand adventure
when you were a kid.

1305
01:42:32,583 --> 01:42:34,041
Yes, and that adventure made me sensible.

1306
01:42:34,125 --> 01:42:35,458
Now, will you run onto the road again?

1307
01:42:35,541 --> 01:42:36,875
No. Never. I never will.

1308
01:42:37,083 --> 01:42:39,666
Go and drink your milk like a good pig.

1309
01:42:54,458 --> 01:42:56,166
<span style="style.default_1">Oh, way to go!</span>
