1
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:11,969
"Like in that manner..."

2
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:26,316
"Then came the princess with
the royal amour and sword."

3
00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:31,122
"Then the game started with the
reconnaissance of drums and armlets."

4
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:37,535
"Will call as and always...
Will play the flute."

5
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:42,572
"Wake up my beloved! Hastily,
my flower from the sky."

6
00:02:43,062 --> 00:02:48,740
"Then came the princess with
the royal amour and sword."

7
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:54,409
"Then the game started with the
reconnaissance of drums and armlets."

8
00:02:54,507 --> 00:03:00,150
"Will call as and always...
Will play the flute."

9
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:05,662
"Wake up my beloved!
Hastily, my flower from the sky."

10
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:49,268
Today, I'm drunk a little bit, no, not
a little bit, rather in a fairy manner.

11
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:54,474
No matter how much I
drink, I'm the same person!

12
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:18,666
Get lost man!

13
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:28,007
Hey you! Are you following me!
I've no connection with you.

14
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,603
How dare you follow
me? Don't touch that!

15
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:35,413
Hey you! As today is the wedding
anniversary ofAchu and me,

16
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:37,385
I have invited you only.

17
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:37,921
Yes.

18
00:04:37,977 --> 00:04:42,281
You rascal! You had insulted me, as
I've offered you whisky out of love,

19
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,583
you threw it out!

20
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:47,326
Boss, I'm not like you, once I drink,

21
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:49,526
I get tipsy fast, the moment I
see the bed, I will fall asleep.

22
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:53,628
I'll also sleep, but to find out the
bed, it will take tmro or three hours!

23
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:55,001
Boss!
You get lost!

24
00:04:55,094 --> 00:04:57,370
Don't know what all
things will happen today!

25
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:14,858
My God! How to
ake this, from here!

26
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:20,693
No worries, if you don't have a
mood to travel in an auto.

27
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:23,996
I'll just quit, after wishing a
happy wedding anniversary.

28
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:31,342
Boss, come madam
might have slept now;

29
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:34,742
we will go now and
wish tomorrow morning.

30
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:37,475
What have slept! But
the light is still on upstairs, look!

31
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:41,474
That is because, it is power cut, may
be that is why it is not turned off!

32
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:45,886
Hey you! Don't con man!
What did you think, I'm drunk!

33
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:48,383
Not only in this street light,

34
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:51,019
will call myAchu, in every
pillar and even in shackles!

35
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:56,031
That is my prerogative,
did you understand that?

36
00:05:57,156 --> 00:05:58,328
Okay let it be then!

37
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:04,266
Get lost with your auto;
with me I've good legs!

38
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,604
Chandra Bose will drink again,

39
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:12,840
how much I drink, will
walk in a steady manner.

40
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,011
Hey man! Turn off the lights!

41
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:20,348
Don't fall!

42
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:22,351
Don't scold! Didn't catch you!

43
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:26,362
I'm the one who is drunk, but you
are the one, who had lost his mind.

44
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,867
Can't he understand,
if he had his mind!

45
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:35,867
My wife who had sent, me a divorce
notice, will she come with me?

46
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:38,735
That too, in this late
hours of the night!

47
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:43,008
See, I told something on
intoxicating, on hearing that,

48
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:45,082
had now taken an auto and left.

49
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,318
To belittle people!

50
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:53,784
What to do? He had become
a world class, failure!

51
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:55,715
You!
I'll sit here.

52
00:06:57,116 --> 00:06:58,254
Better you lie there.

53
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:05,532
Not only her, if anybody else says,
Chandra Bose will be like this only!

54
00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:11,771
I'll drink, again I'll drink,
how much I drink,

55
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:16,438
will walk steady like
this and, my God!

56
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:17,580
Only, this much!

57
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:29,358
I'll drink, again! Will sit
like this and drink!

58
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:53,974
Achu, what have you thought about
me? I'll sleep somewhere, after drinking.

59
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:07,215
<i>$11224.</i>

60
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:21,964
My God, what is this?
Oh! Who is this?

61
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:28,841
Hey don't scream like this!

62
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:32,313
Because of your noise,
Mani can't hear my calling.

63
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:33,576
Mani!

64
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:40,957
Where?

65
00:09:49,488 --> 00:09:50,831
What?
Come fast.

66
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:56,438
Best place, to dive!

67
00:09:57,063 --> 00:09:58,940
Became normal so fast, did it?

68
00:09:59,031 --> 00:10:01,068
It is not, I'm out of intoxication,
I guy dived, by tying on my leg.

69
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:05,041
Who is this?
Your Father!

70
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:06,182
My Father'?

71
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:12,284
You silly, stop your
interview and pull me out.

72
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:34,274
Pull him up, my leg.

73
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:41,276
This thing is too heavy!
Pull him up.

74
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:44,911
Catch... Catch there.

75
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:50,560
Give me the hand, come here.

76
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:58,929
No need of such things!
Don't throw that, you!

77
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:01,362
What? Is it required?

78
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,303
Untie the knot from my leg.

79
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:08,436
This is what we say bad
times, when our time is bad;

80
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:11,241
people like him
will hang on our legs!

81
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:14,642
As I was prepared to die, mister
who told you to, pull me up like this.

82
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,720
You die, why you drag me also!

83
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:18,288
Is it intentional? It was a mistake!

84
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:20,549
Is that so, you pulled
my boss's leg and tried to kill;

85
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,556
...now you are saying
it was a mistake!

86
00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:23,558
If you wanted to die, you
should have tied on your neck,

87
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:24,661
not on your stomach.

88
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,852
These men will tell the truth, only
once we drown him in the

89
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:28,363
backwaters by tying
stone on his leg.

90
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:31,092
What was your intention?
Tell the truth!

91
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:35,262
I'll make him tell all that, for the time
being take a bottle from the vehicle.

92
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:37,669
As this filthy guy, hanged from my
legs, whatever that was drunk,

93
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:38,901
simply vanished away!

94
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:41,369
Making people work laboriously!

95
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:55,392
What is your name?
Sharath.

96
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,619
Oh! A good name.

97
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:02,661
Studying?
Yes.

98
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:08,400
Where?
Newton Engineering College.

99
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:10,666
Then didn't pass?

100
00:12:13,632 --> 00:12:15,805
Tell what's your problem?

101
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:18,176
Now you are my problem,
will you get lost, please!

102
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:40,667
Hey are you going without,
handing him over to police?

103
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:43,399
Tomorrow the police dog will come
to our house, sniffing his dead body.

104
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:46,669
Now, he will not die, out of despair
in failing in exam, decided to die.

105
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,309
He failed in that!

106
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:53,643
Not failed in exam!
Was made to fail, intentionally!

107
00:12:55,307 --> 00:12:58,447
I'm the best student in
Newton Engineering College.

108
00:12:58,644 --> 00:13:02,649
The one and only student who
secured a placement in Oracle.

109
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:07,318
A person like me, they have
intentionally failed me, in course viva.

110
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:07,922
A person like me, they have
intentionally failed me, in course viva.

111
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:12,502
Sharath, come fast, that examiner,
who came from Malabar MES,

112
00:13:12,658 --> 00:13:15,070
who sliced you
at the course viva.

113
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:18,970
He had landed at the town;
ourfull team had gone there now.

114
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:19,803
For what?

115
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,569
For what? You come
fast and get on the bike.

116
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,441
Hey Jabbar what
foolishness are you doing?

117
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:29,346
If anybody had failed in that.

118
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:35,254
The smart ones will
pass, others will fail!

119
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,193
Sharath has failed not
because he is poor in studies,

120
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:40,797
but you had failed
him, for somebody.

121
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:41,954
You move back!

122
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:43,531
Oh! My God!

123
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:58,604
Sir, Sharath is innocent, we are
ones who infringed professor.

124
00:13:58,737 --> 00:14:01,775
No need of explaining all that, as
it had become a police case...

125
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:03,353
I cannot rescue you.

126
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:04,476
We have done no mistake.

127
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:06,079
Okay wait outside, will call.

128
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:11,425
Sir, have spoken to that professor,

129
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:15,657
if required the complaint
can be limited to Sharth only.

130
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:21,167
We'll have to recommend
for, debarring of Sharath.

131
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:25,673
Sir, will it not affect the
reputation of the college?

132
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:30,673
Sir, it is better than
debarring five students.

133
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:42,247
Even in that moment,
when everything ended,

134
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:43,952
I grieved not thinking about me.

135
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:46,060
Thinking about my sister!

136
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:51,300
My sister was only
1 .5 years older than me;

137
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,761
she longed to
become an air hostess.

138
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:57,072
Became a primary school
teacher, for my education.

139
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,607
When Father expired, left all that.

140
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:04,139
Now, even my
carrier itself is expunged,

141
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:09,275
and then what is
the use, of me living?

142
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:11,185
So sad!

143
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:20,964
Hey tell me the truth, you
had drained half of this

144
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:22,360
and had filled the half with water.

145
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:23,364
Is that how, you gave this to me?

146
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:24,924
Don't tell lies!

147
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,730
Don't teach me what is
the kick of half bottle whisky?

148
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,931
In the name of my Mother who is
no more, I have not added water.

149
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:31,167
Don't beat me.

150
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:32,633
You idiot, are you telling lies?

151
00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:36,745
By adding water to whisky, swearing
in the name of Mother, who is dead!

152
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:39,714
Not me.

153
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:40,915
There!

154
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:44,018
I'm lamenting on my sorrows
and you are bothered about

155
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:46,214
the strength of the whisky is it not?

156
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:48,848
I've told all this to
a drunkard like you!

157
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:54,729
Who is this guy?
This is Sharath.

158
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:03,504
What did he do?

159
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:06,234
He was expelled from
the college bar for four years.

160
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:11,479
Is it four years or three years?
Yea, bar...Debar.

161
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,310
Then what did I say?

162
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:16,107
Boss, you threw the bottle to
the sea, by saying I added

163
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:17,280
water to the whisky.

164
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:19,783
I threw that because; it
was a waste, a real waste!

165
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,354
This is also similar to that!

166
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:33,065
All the yesterdays are not meant to
be saved! Some of them are waste.

167
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:36,707
Must be thrown completely
or else they will ruin us!

168
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:42,973
Your problem, a small
problem. You leave that to me,

169
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:45,612
it is not a mere
babble of a drunkard.

170
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:56,158
Why are you shaking hands?

171
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,829
Just thought not to
waste a shake hand.

172
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:05,433
No, I'll not come
I cannot face sister.

173
00:17:05,557 --> 00:17:10,006
You will come, will face sister and
you will solve this by yourself.

174
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:12,200
That is the magic of life.

175
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:25,946
Come, slowly.
Get lost you!

176
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:35,027
Looks like somebody has
come here turned on the lights.

177
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:39,263
Will ruin everythinglSorry, we
are ones who had come here.

178
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:42,802
Shhh! I will speak everything.

179
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:58,445
Who is that?
It is me. Jo.

180
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:00,615
Where were you, till this mid night?

181
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:02,215
Oh! Door is over there, is it not?

182
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:05,283
Who has come along with you?

183
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:11,200
I'm Chandra Bose. I met
your brother Sharath on the way.

184
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:12,961
Only few minutes back.

185
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,768
Has left?

186
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:19,774
Oh! The door is over there, is it not?

187
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:27,107
What is this jail or what?
With bars and all.

188
00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:28,849
Opened!

189
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:31,683
Who is this?

190
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:36,391
Gone!

191
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:44,761
Sorry, on meeting, by
calling you from sleep.

192
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:49,029
That is my assistant
Mani, this is Sharath.

193
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:52,173
Hey, whom all have you
called in the middle of the night?

194
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:52,935
That is...

195
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,006
No, Sharath had
not brought us here,

196
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,046
we have brought Sharath here.

197
00:18:58,103 --> 00:19:02,518
Or else he would have come in an
ambulance or in a stretcher, my God!

198
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:06,715
Today he played a game!
This fellow! This Sharath.

199
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:11,420
Suicide! He tried
to commit a suicide.

200
00:19:13,385 --> 00:19:15,331
My God, lost all hopes!

201
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:21,204
After tying a big stone on his body
he plunged to the back waters.

202
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:24,566
That rope tangled on my leg and

203
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,769
I was also about to be drowned
in back waters and dead.

204
00:19:33,238 --> 00:19:39,314
The reason for the suicide was funnier.
Got failed in the course viva.

205
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:41,858
Because of that he
had lost his placement.

206
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:44,257
On account of that
he assaulted the examiner.

207
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:47,353
Then, he got debarred
for three years.

208
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:50,490
<i>For that he tried committing suicide.</i>

209
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:02,879
On account of that, good night.

210
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:11,878
See that is all, sister
understood everything,

211
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:13,354
closed the door
and went to sleep.

212
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:15,323
Now you also go
and sleep comfortably.

213
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:18,953
Sleep comfortably, if my sister does
anything unwise, I'll show you..

214
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:22,256
What is he talking about?
I've only said, what had happened.

215
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:24,665
Things are all true but the
manner of saying was different!

216
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:27,999
Don't disturb a person
who is sleeping comfortably.

217
00:20:29,194 --> 00:20:29,729
Move!

218
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:31,441
Jo!

219
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,272
Why are these men
running like this?

220
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:42,714
Jo, don't ...open the door.

221
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:46,388
Jo, I'm the one, who
is saying, open the door.

222
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:51,622
They have failed me intentionally,
not because I've not studied.

223
00:20:51,683 --> 00:20:53,754
Jo, open the door.

224
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:55,854
Jo, let me explain.

225
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:57,126
What is really going on here?

226
00:20:57,256 --> 00:21:01,864
Jo, open the door, I'm
the one who is telling.

227
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:04,363
What the hell have you done?

228
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:08,506
The entire family has got
this disease, suicide mania!

229
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:15,284
Is this the magic, if
something happens on my Jo.

230
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,410
Will not spare you both!

231
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:33,460
Hey you move back!

232
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:41,840
Don't just stare there
and stand, hold her!

233
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:47,634
<i>$11224.</i>

234
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:12,533
Mother, my hand! Hold me!

235
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:15,205
What are you doing?

236
00:22:19,204 --> 00:22:20,410
What? Did anything happen?

237
00:22:22,407 --> 00:22:23,784
Go and get some water.

238
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,515
What? After all this boozing?
Still are you going to take more?

239
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:26,777
Not for me, for her.

240
00:22:26,778 --> 00:22:27,347
Go man!

241
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,250
Don't know where the kitchen is?

242
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:34,527
Jo, what have you done?

243
00:22:41,326 --> 00:22:42,999
Here, take, drink water.

244
00:22:49,968 --> 00:22:52,710
Now look, you had a great sorrow
for not studying, in college...

245
00:22:52,804 --> 00:22:55,250
this is what happens
when you study in colleges.

246
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:58,020
He had failed seven times in tenth,

247
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:59,953
even now when he
writes he will fail, is it not?

248
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:02,179
Then what those, contem ptible
fellows had changed the syllabus,

249
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,251
othenlvise somehow,
I would have passed.

250
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:08,161
This is the hope!

251
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:14,299
Shachin Tendulkkar, if he
had committed suicide...

252
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:17,340
on failing at tenth standard.

253
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:20,475
So, Sachin is ourteam is it not,
those failed in tenth?

254
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:23,445
Mush have told this one year back.

255
00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:25,072
My mother would
have died peacefully!

256
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:29,750
Marks secured in exams do
not decide our talents.

257
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:33,118
Bill Gates and Steve Johns
have they secured any ranks?

258
00:23:33,211 --> 00:23:34,986
Have changed the
face of this world.

259
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,986
When they were
chucked out from college.

260
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:40,722
Never did they go
straight to commit suicide.

261
00:23:40,786 --> 00:23:43,665
They never stood,
to be valued by unwise men,

262
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:45,200
they were in search
of their own way.

263
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:46,769
Then what had taken
place is all history.

264
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:51,103
Now, that way has opened for you.

265
00:23:56,835 --> 00:23:59,975
For me one week is enough
to take him to that path.

266
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:21,794
Will go!

267
00:24:21,893 --> 00:24:24,897
How come we go like that, what
happens when, both hang together?

268
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:26,976
Nothing will happen like
that, you take the vehicle.

269
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:33,715
I'm a university
professor. My mother!

270
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:36,581
No university will debar me on
account of beating this professor.

271
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:39,577
Because I, myself, am a university.

272
00:24:39,578 --> 00:24:43,958
Hey this man is mad! My dear
auto brothers come and save me.

273
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:45,323
What is it? What is the problem?

274
00:24:45,383 --> 00:24:46,259
Who are you?

275
00:24:46,384 --> 00:24:48,022
Why are you beating
up the professor?

276
00:24:48,086 --> 00:24:49,156
Tell Mani.

277
00:24:49,287 --> 00:24:50,857
This is the problem
between two universities;

278
00:24:50,956 --> 00:24:52,560
we do not have the
qualification to interfere in this.

279
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:56,765
Hey you! Professor tell,
who told you to fail Sharath?

280
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:58,432
I've not made to fail anyone,

281
00:24:58,530 --> 00:24:59,907
the person, whom you
are looking is different.

282
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:02,911
Tell, tell...Tell.

283
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:05,974
<i>I will tell.</i>

284
00:25:06,738 --> 00:25:07,739
For whom?

285
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:08,977
<i>For Menu“ sir.</i>

286
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,075
For whom?

287
00:25:10,141 --> 00:25:14,783
Owner of Info Solutions,
Shivashankara Menon.

288
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:20,247
<i>$11224.</i>

289
00:25:26,224 --> 00:25:29,034
Sir, as per your instruction we had
made that boy to fail and debarred him.

290
00:25:29,094 --> 00:25:35,170
We both were beaten up by these
people; we were not put on ground.

291
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:44,084
Sir what harm did that Sharath do to you?
Or else that drunkard will kill us.

292
00:25:44,175 --> 00:25:44,880
Sharath!

293
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:48,583
Who is that Sharath? Why must I
instruct to debar him and fail him?

294
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:50,852
Domenic who are these people?

295
00:25:51,449 --> 00:25:53,122
Move them all!

296
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:01,198
On discussing a serious matter,
are you assaulting you rascal?

297
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:03,330
You!
Father!

298
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:11,078
I must not beat you
in front of the daughter.

299
00:26:16,675 --> 00:26:20,646
You had ruined the life of a boy
who is as old as your daughter.

300
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:24,381
Do you know, he and his
sister attempted for a suicide.

301
00:26:24,382 --> 00:26:26,726
I have saved then,
in the heck of a hair line!

302
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:28,264
That is this ladies luck!

303
00:26:28,386 --> 00:26:31,663
Or else that would have
been a curse all through

304
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:33,896
the life of your daughter.

305
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:44,244
Like the elders say, the enmity and
friendship must be with equals.

306
00:26:44,302 --> 00:26:48,409
Or else, will perish!

307
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:54,148
This is the starting of your perish
lings! This Chandra Bose is telling that!

308
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:58,086
Hey you!

309
00:26:58,717 --> 00:26:59,593
Move back!

310
00:27:04,222 --> 00:27:06,168
Father what cruelty have you done?

311
00:27:06,358 --> 00:27:08,838
In some moment, he had
come and told he likes me.

312
00:27:08,994 --> 00:27:12,066
I had discouraged and send
back, by telling I'm not interested.

313
00:27:12,697 --> 00:27:15,303
I came here and told
everything to Father as a joke.

314
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,540
Now, I really regret it,
really I regret it.

315
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,678
I've lot of dreams about you.

316
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:26,815
I will not tolerate anything
which comes a hindrance to that.

317
00:27:27,245 --> 00:27:30,055
Once he gets that big job in that
American company, what is the surety?

318
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:33,355
That he will not come again, in
front of you, requesting to love.

319
00:27:36,955 --> 00:27:38,434
Did you destroy his carrier for that?

320
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:52,242
Whatever you say about the boss,
is fine but I really do have a trust in him.

321
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:56,448
That is why, I had told
must meet him, once again.

322
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,146
He has agreed to come here.

323
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:01,747
But, no guarantee in
what condition it will be.

324
00:28:02,547 --> 00:28:04,424
Here, he comes.

325
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:11,390
Why are you all here?

326
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:14,526
Hey you!
What?

327
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:20,002
When had they come? Did
you serve them with drinks?

328
00:28:20,131 --> 00:28:23,578
This is their house, we came here,
as boss wanted to meet them.

329
00:28:23,902 --> 00:28:29,909
Oh! Is it? Hey, Jo, Good morning!

330
00:28:30,108 --> 00:28:32,645
Lucky that you have
not forgotten my name.

331
00:28:32,744 --> 00:28:33,848
Lucky?

332
00:28:36,648 --> 00:28:38,093
Is it not Jyothy?

333
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:39,886
Today had little bit more doesn't it?

334
00:28:39,984 --> 00:28:42,294
Hey nothing like that.
Had slept inside the vehicle.

335
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:45,493
Hey! You slept and drove
the vehicle. You rascal!

336
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:46,568
You stare at me!

337
00:28:46,624 --> 00:28:48,729
My God, failed,

338
00:28:48,827 --> 00:28:51,398
teacher, tomorrow I'll bring,
today nothing will come of this.

339
00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:55,002
Go and sit in the vehicle.

340
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:58,570
Hey you! Are you the
boss? Or am 'I the boss?

341
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:00,081
You are the boss, the booze!

342
00:29:00,605 --> 00:29:03,677
What is that you
wanted to meet me?

343
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:06,919
On the other day,
boss had told a word.

344
00:29:07,946 --> 00:29:10,222
A word? What word?

345
00:29:10,348 --> 00:29:14,160
Within a week Sharath's problem
will be solved, you had told that.

346
00:29:14,285 --> 00:29:19,257
Yes, that I'll solve within one week.

347
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:22,299
There is only three more
days left for a week.

348
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:23,633
Three days are there no?

349
00:29:23,728 --> 00:29:25,969
More than enough. Before
that person will come.

350
00:29:26,064 --> 00:29:28,237
Person? Which person?

351
00:29:36,841 --> 00:29:40,618
Not finished what I was
saying, the person is here.

352
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:53,836
I could not meet you,
amidst that chaos.

353
00:30:05,036 --> 00:30:07,346
This problem cannot be solved
just like that by saying mere sorry.

354
00:30:08,273 --> 00:30:10,275
I'm talking to Sharath.

355
00:30:10,575 --> 00:30:12,714
I'm talking for Sharath.

356
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,790
I'm not interested to
talk to drunkards.

357
00:30:20,051 --> 00:30:21,052
I'm not talking.

358
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:30,506
I don't know what is the solution for
the cruelty done by my Father to you.

359
00:30:30,795 --> 00:30:37,974
But if I can do anything on
that I'm ready. I came to tell this.

360
00:30:51,282 --> 00:30:56,630
See, how the path is
cleared, this is what I said.

361
00:31:00,592 --> 00:31:05,592
<i>$11224.</i>

362
00:31:47,772 --> 00:31:51,481
Right from morning to till this time,
I have never had a drop.

363
00:31:58,516 --> 00:32:01,690
Don't be angry, only seven minutes.

364
00:32:01,786 --> 00:32:03,788
I should discuss a
personal matter with you.

365
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:08,633
Only seven minutes are enough
I cannot hold on for long.

366
00:32:08,693 --> 00:32:10,138
Didn't I tell you, this is office time?

367
00:32:10,561 --> 00:32:12,632
Okay then after the office time,

368
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:16,837
shall we talk? I need only
seven minutes, will wait outside.

369
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:22,675
Who had let him inside?

370
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:26,688
Who? No one was let
inside from here, mam.

371
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,780
Then, did he rapture from above?

372
00:32:42,927 --> 00:32:45,407
Sorry mam, I didn't see
when he got inside.

373
00:32:45,496 --> 00:32:47,737
He should not be seen in this vicinity,
did you understand that?

374
00:32:57,275 --> 00:32:59,778
Madam told you should
not be seen here.

375
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:01,145
Did she say like that?

376
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:05,355
What a pity, then you
may go I'll sit here alone.

377
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:07,963
Not to me, it was told to you, sir.

378
00:33:08,086 --> 00:33:08,962
To me?

379
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:11,958
I was told that will meet
at office after five o clock.

380
00:33:12,056 --> 00:33:15,367
There is lot of time for that, sir you
can go and come by five o'clock.

381
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:17,530
I don't have any places
to go and today...

382
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:20,472
my aim is to meet Miss, Anu Menon.

383
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:29,217
Have you send him off?

384
00:33:29,307 --> 00:33:32,584
No mam, is sitting here by saying,
meeting mam is the ambition.

385
00:33:33,478 --> 00:33:34,889
What to do?

386
00:33:35,046 --> 00:33:38,050
Ignore him, will go automatically
after getting pissed off!

387
00:34:22,527 --> 00:34:26,236
Madam he has...Not gone!

388
00:34:27,331 --> 00:34:29,174
Can't you people give
some peace of mind?

389
00:35:06,904 --> 00:35:08,383
All of you go and do your work.

390
00:35:12,677 --> 00:35:14,213
What is the use of all this?

391
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:16,012
If something happens
without taking alcohol,

392
00:35:16,013 --> 00:35:17,117
who will be responsible for it?

393
00:35:18,082 --> 00:35:20,153
It is there in the vehicle
shall I go and bring it.

394
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:23,094
That is not possible then
she will not talk. You wait.

395
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:33,575
Mam do we have to call the police?

396
00:35:34,932 --> 00:35:36,775
Did he create any problems?

397
00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:39,040
No, no problem for the
time being, he is taking rest.

398
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:58,626
After this he might start immediately.

399
00:36:12,803 --> 00:36:13,873
Leave me!

400
00:36:13,938 --> 00:36:14,939
You come here!

401
00:36:27,985 --> 00:36:29,259
What do you want?

402
00:36:33,758 --> 00:36:36,534
Mam, he got inside by swiping
my card, when I went outside.

403
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:39,438
Then what? How will I get
inside? Is the office time over?

404
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:42,909
Never in my life, had I stayed
this long, without taking alcohol.

405
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,946
All my blood got dried!

406
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:52,150
All Iasked is seven minutes! Neither
did I ask you for the life time!

407
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:53,948
For your seven minutes

408
00:36:54,011 --> 00:36:57,049
I had spent my eight hours
without drinking, totally dry!

409
00:36:57,114 --> 00:36:59,390
Now that prick of consciousness
is hunting me! Hey you!

410
00:36:59,517 --> 00:37:01,656
If you have anything
to tell, you can tell here.

411
00:37:01,953 --> 00:37:03,489
We will go inside and talk.

412
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:05,992
Here, everything is transparent,

413
00:37:06,357 --> 00:37:09,338
. can say those things
which can be told from here.

414
00:37:15,866 --> 00:37:19,177
Other day, as you told Anu will
be there with Sharath always,

415
00:37:19,303 --> 00:37:25,584
. not only Anu but this
whole team should be there.

416
00:37:46,864 --> 00:37:49,105
What you have told,
is sincerely to Sharath,

417
00:37:50,334 --> 00:37:53,406
. must bring them also
when you come next time.

418
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:55,943
If it is not possible,
difficult to do, leave it.

419
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:59,646
He'll think Anu have told that
simply, without much thought.

420
00:38:07,585 --> 00:38:08,859
Then this lady also!

421
00:38:21,098 --> 00:38:22,509
Tell Mister Chandra Bose.

422
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,410
What should I tell? Mrs.
Chandra Bose.

423
00:38:26,504 --> 00:38:28,484
No, now I'm not the
mirses of anybody.

424
00:38:29,674 --> 00:38:31,711
The moment from which I had
send the notice to separate,

425
00:38:32,209 --> 00:38:33,711
I'm independent.

426
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:37,382
That is not decided by Achu alone.
I should also decide on that.

427
00:38:37,515 --> 00:38:41,486
Yes, that is required. I
came here to request that.

428
00:38:42,687 --> 00:38:44,291
Must sign in all this.

429
00:38:44,455 --> 00:38:52,067
I don't intend to. You try if you can
separate the relationship and go.

430
00:38:52,897 --> 00:38:56,037
Let the court decide whether
it can be plucked out from me.

431
00:39:13,551 --> 00:39:15,531
I'll not sign in anything at all.

432
00:39:17,154 --> 00:39:19,031
Achu you have changed a lot!

433
00:39:40,177 --> 00:39:41,952
Achu you have changed a lot!

434
00:40:23,454 --> 00:40:27,129
There was a Chandru's who
really understood me, before.

435
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:35,502
Now I'm not me, someone else!

436
00:40:47,578 --> 00:40:52,550
Boss, we were looking
after you, in all the bars.

437
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:54,756
Have you found me,
anywhere there?

438
00:40:54,852 --> 00:40:55,523
No.

439
00:40:56,687 --> 00:40:59,827
So, it is me the very me! Speak
up frankly what is the matter?

440
00:40:59,924 --> 00:41:01,767
Boss, everybody is
waiting outside to see you.

441
00:41:01,892 --> 00:41:04,270
Who all?
Anu, Jo and everybody.

442
00:41:04,361 --> 00:41:05,465
Oh, really!

443
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:08,166
So, everybody is there, doesn't it?

444
00:41:15,072 --> 00:41:17,552
Oh! This person doesn't
speak to drunkards, is it not?

445
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:35,166
We've already traced out one,

446
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:37,865
a software com pany, which
was annulled, two years back.

447
00:41:41,899 --> 00:41:43,469
To set up an office like that...

448
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:45,911
we may require something
like four to five crores.

449
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:48,746
He is ready to hand over that to us,

450
00:41:48,806 --> 00:41:51,480
on the basis of profit
sharing, on a small percentage.

451
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:56,215
They have got some bank
liabilities to the tune of three crores;

452
00:41:56,714 --> 00:41:58,785
we'll have to settle that.

453
00:42:02,887 --> 00:42:08,132
If, boss, intends...
Three crores.

454
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,831
As far as I'm concerned
that is not a big amount.

455
00:42:12,396 --> 00:42:15,866
But at present, I'm in a problem.

456
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:21,443
I and my wife are on
the verge of a divorce.

457
00:42:22,273 --> 00:42:24,810
And my account is a joint account.

458
00:42:26,744 --> 00:42:29,224
No worries, though there
are certain issues with me,

459
00:42:29,313 --> 00:42:31,259
on the matters like
these, she is very supportive.

460
00:42:31,348 --> 00:42:38,664
I'll ask, all this time, she was
with me in the bar, just left right now.

461
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:44,070
Just left from the bar...Best couple!

462
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:51,008
I called to discuss a different matter.

463
00:42:51,168 --> 00:42:51,873
Go on.

464
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:56,040
I've some young friends
of mine, IT professionals.

465
00:42:57,007 --> 00:43:01,251
For them, to start a firm,
they need our support.

466
00:43:06,183 --> 00:43:07,662
So, can't we help them?

467
00:43:07,785 --> 00:43:10,561
The money gained like that,
will not have any value.

468
00:43:11,655 --> 00:43:13,692
Tell them to raise the funds.

469
00:43:13,891 --> 00:43:17,031
Only then, they will come to know
the value of hard work. Tell them.

470
00:43:18,295 --> 00:43:21,504
Make, them understand that. Okay!

471
00:43:34,678 --> 00:43:38,125
What Achu says is, you must
find the money by yourself.

472
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:42,256
Only then, you'll have responsibility.
What, she says is correct.

473
00:43:43,988 --> 00:43:49,461
For me, whatever she says has
turned out to become right.

474
00:43:49,593 --> 00:43:55,566
Three crores is it not? There will be
some way out; you will have to find that.

475
00:43:57,101 --> 00:43:57,875
<i>An“?</i>

476
00:43:58,902 --> 00:44:01,746
Keep quite! That wouldn't be
sufficient, as, I told you.

477
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:05,018
Hey! What is Chinnu saying?

478
00:44:09,713 --> 00:44:11,624
Come on tell.

479
00:44:11,749 --> 00:44:14,229
What she says, she has got
some property in her native,

480
00:44:14,284 --> 00:44:15,661
on discussing with her
Father that can be disposed.

481
00:44:15,786 --> 00:44:17,766
Is it? A good thing we
can think about that.

482
00:44:18,088 --> 00:44:19,931
Where do you think the property is?

483
00:44:20,024 --> 00:44:22,698
The interior of Kuttanad! One must
travel by rice boats and boats!

484
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:23,895
What good does it make,
on selling that?

485
00:44:24,028 --> 00:44:25,598
Lucky if one gets,
Rs.1, 000 per cent!

486
00:44:25,796 --> 00:44:27,639
Whatever we get well off with that,
will only have to seek for the balance.

487
00:44:32,236 --> 00:44:37,515
Whatever small you get, that will be
your initial capital. So, at the earliest,

488
00:44:37,641 --> 00:44:42,454
We go, to meet Chinnu's
Father, to Kuttanadu.

489
00:44:42,579 --> 00:44:42,812
Are these properly dried?

490
00:44:42,813 --> 00:44:43,655
Are these properly dried?

491
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:47,754
Look, that is my Father.

492
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:52,960
Did we come all this way,
to see a person like him?

493
00:44:53,123 --> 00:44:56,229
Walk along.
Come. Come on.

494
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:00,271
You stupid, didn't I tell you,
to take them to the house?

495
00:45:00,397 --> 00:45:01,740
We were the ones, who told
we must meet Kunnunichettan,

496
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:02,707
and insisted to come here.

497
00:45:02,833 --> 00:45:04,938
This is the Chandra
Bose sir, is it not?

498
00:45:05,302 --> 00:45:07,646
Not sir, boss.
Yes, boss indeed!

499
00:45:07,805 --> 00:45:10,081
Hey Johnny, chop and bring
some tender coconuts for them.

500
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:11,413
Come, we'll sit inside.

501
00:45:12,843 --> 00:45:17,986
When she phoned, told that you are
all going to start a company, and all.

502
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:19,891
For that, a lot of money
is required for that.

503
00:45:19,983 --> 00:45:23,362
Does it come to 10 to 15 Iakhs?

504
00:45:25,355 --> 00:45:27,767
That may not be sufficient;
a little more will be required.

505
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:30,394
Little more? Means,
how much is that?

506
00:45:30,594 --> 00:45:32,540
Will require about three crores.

507
00:45:33,597 --> 00:45:35,270
<i>Three craves'.!</i>

508
00:45:35,632 --> 00:45:39,512
Hey Chinnu, you little one,
along with the other little ones.

509
00:45:39,636 --> 00:45:41,411
<i>With three craves investment,"</i>

510
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:42,880
what kind of a company
are you going to start?

511
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:47,489
None of these are little ones, they
are promising IT professionals.

512
00:45:47,878 --> 00:45:50,358
They have identified
a software company.

513
00:45:50,447 --> 00:45:53,860
For that, must require
three crores rupees.

514
00:45:53,984 --> 00:45:55,930
Then, did you get
any solution for that?

515
00:45:56,553 --> 00:46:00,091
No, it has to be arranged, for that,
first we came here, that's all.

516
00:46:00,724 --> 00:46:03,432
For that, what to do?

517
00:46:04,862 --> 00:46:06,398
Hey Johnny!
Yes.

518
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:09,272
Dial that Sulaiman's
number in that mobile.

519
00:46:09,399 --> 00:46:12,903
My heavens! She had
come here, along with you,

520
00:46:13,036 --> 00:46:16,347
if I can't do anything it
is a matter of grief.

521
00:46:16,507 --> 00:46:17,781
It is ringing.
Is it?

522
00:46:19,076 --> 00:46:22,956
Hallo, hey you! How much
money do you have there?

523
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:26,361
From that, take off, 3 cr, from that!

524
00:46:33,991 --> 00:46:35,470
An urgent requirement,

525
00:46:35,993 --> 00:46:39,338
I'll send Pitham baran <i>,</i> okay ,just
check whether it is disconnected.

526
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:42,409
Then we will all together go home.

527
00:46:42,933 --> 00:46:50,715
<i>$11224.</i>

528
00:46:51,108 --> 00:46:52,985
Here, all what you have told, 3 cr.

529
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:54,953
You, yourself give it to daughter.

530
00:46:55,112 --> 00:46:57,922
That is not required. Father
must hand over that to Sharath.

531
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:08,265
I, somehow feel like
giving this money to you,

532
00:47:08,425 --> 00:47:10,837
your face has got a 'royal touch'!

533
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:13,869
I trust you, more than
anybody in this group.

534
00:47:14,364 --> 00:47:17,402
Boss, collect it, more
over boss should collect it,

535
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:18,571
that is the appropriate way of it.

536
00:47:20,938 --> 00:47:22,781
Hey You! Get lost man!

537
00:47:25,042 --> 00:47:28,888
I'm only collecting it on their behalf;
I'm not there, in this company.

538
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:30,922
They are jointly starting this.

539
00:47:31,081 --> 00:47:33,027
There is nothing wrong in that.

540
00:47:33,083 --> 00:47:37,054
I'm a true village folk, I don't know
this business and all, even if.

541
00:47:37,254 --> 00:47:38,358
When I'm told also, I won't
understand all these things.

542
00:47:38,488 --> 00:47:40,627
I'm an old fourth standard failed!

543
00:47:40,757 --> 00:47:42,998
That is why, all this money and all!

544
00:47:43,393 --> 00:47:47,170
This money is not mine, but of
hers, this is her Mothefs share.

545
00:47:47,264 --> 00:47:49,141
That is why I'm asking all this.

546
00:47:49,266 --> 00:47:52,270
The money in her name is the
capital of the company, doesn't it?

547
00:47:52,436 --> 00:47:56,111
Hence forth, the company's 51% of
ownership, will it not be in her name?

548
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:07,556
Then, there is balance 49% what is
it called, sweat equity, is it not?

549
00:48:07,684 --> 00:48:08,856
Yes, sweat equity.

550
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:12,696
That, you all decide
how it has to be done.

551
00:48:12,823 --> 00:48:14,393
Why not? It can be done like that.

552
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,631
This guy is not the
way he looks like!

553
00:48:19,029 --> 00:48:21,031
That is the problem with our vision.

554
00:48:24,301 --> 00:48:26,611
What is wrong in what
Chinnu's Father had told?

555
00:48:26,703 --> 00:48:29,946
No one will be prepared
to give 49% sweat equity.

556
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,280
Why you are not seeing that?

557
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:34,389
Father will say things like that,
I will make him understand.

558
00:48:35,245 --> 00:48:38,089
This is business, so the
things have to be like that.

559
00:48:38,515 --> 00:48:42,827
Then, Chin nu's Father is very frank,
so we must be also like that to him.

560
00:48:47,024 --> 00:48:48,935
One minute, Kunnunichettan.

561
00:48:51,028 --> 00:48:56,842
Don't feel bad on asking
openly to an elderly person?

562
00:48:57,034 --> 00:48:59,014
No, carry on, ask.

563
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:02,614
Do we get good toddy here?

564
00:49:03,573 --> 00:49:05,314
My God business is ruined!

565
00:49:06,243 --> 00:49:11,056
Toddy which is tapped in the
evening. No, won't we get, it.

566
00:49:17,854 --> 00:49:20,733
I liked this fellow a lot.

567
00:49:20,857 --> 00:49:23,167
Me too, this me!

568
00:49:25,028 --> 00:49:27,565
This com pany was
running in a good manner,

569
00:49:27,898 --> 00:49:29,673
the main reason
to shut down this.

570
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:32,178
Is just, because of that monster,
named, Shiva Shankaran.

571
00:49:32,569 --> 00:49:34,515
Then, this is the, daughter
of that monster,

572
00:49:34,604 --> 00:49:36,174
Anu Shiva Shankari,
the lady monster.

573
00:49:37,507 --> 00:49:39,316
Why ? Because she
became his daughter'?

574
00:49:39,443 --> 00:49:41,252
For that, this lady can't do anything.

575
00:49:41,378 --> 00:49:43,949
My greetings!
Who is it?

576
00:49:44,081 --> 00:49:45,526
He is, Sony Chayan.

577
00:49:53,056 --> 00:49:55,866
Why? A sorry for that,
for being private secretary

578
00:49:55,959 --> 00:49:57,529
or not for being,
Mrs. Sony Zachiraya.

579
00:49:58,595 --> 00:50:00,438
What a humor, please come.

580
00:50:02,299 --> 00:50:03,642
Sit down.

581
00:50:05,268 --> 00:50:06,838
What is your name?
Vinod.

582
00:50:07,571 --> 00:50:08,675
Please sit.

583
00:50:08,872 --> 00:50:13,082
My God! Why is that,
this chair has got only arm rests?

584
00:50:24,721 --> 00:50:27,031
Last time when I was on a
religious retreat, had a revelation.

585
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:31,136
To defeat this Shiva Shankara
Menon some is being sent here.

586
00:50:31,395 --> 00:50:36,868
That too in the form of an own
daughter, what should I say?

587
00:50:39,970 --> 00:50:43,713
Upon the name of Lord,
I do not have any conditions;

588
00:50:43,807 --> 00:50:46,287
I'm handing over this
company to you.

589
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:49,391
Then, for the five years
I don't want any profit share at all.

590
00:50:50,981 --> 00:50:53,962
The agreement details and terms
and conditions are all ready,

591
00:50:54,151 --> 00:50:56,324
I'll just mail it, right now.

592
00:51:25,348 --> 00:51:27,453
I cannot agree with
what you are saying.

593
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:31,430
Sony has got longing
for money that, I'll agree.

594
00:51:31,555 --> 00:51:34,695
Longing towards me?
For what? Who is she?

595
00:51:34,791 --> 00:51:36,361
Which she?
This Sony.

596
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:39,166
Sony is not a girl but
a male. Sony Zachiraya.

597
00:51:39,329 --> 00:51:42,936
An indecent fellow, here
there is a person to agree to it.

598
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:46,310
Sony Zachiraya, has
revealed his problem openly.

599
00:51:46,403 --> 00:51:48,212
So what? Should I succumb to that?

600
00:51:48,672 --> 00:51:51,744
Since he openly told that, is it for
that boss is calling him born cheat?

601
00:51:51,875 --> 00:51:53,479
If I was the one, I
would have slapped him.

602
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:56,390
Why I called him born cheat...

603
00:51:56,513 --> 00:51:58,925
is because he tried to put
all his problems on your head.

604
00:51:59,015 --> 00:52:01,256
Not on their head, but tried
to put it on my head is it not?

605
00:52:01,885 --> 00:52:02,955
Don't threaten by staring!

606
00:52:03,086 --> 00:52:05,623
Anu, why is that you
are saying no to this deal?

607
00:52:05,922 --> 00:52:08,129
We'll not go together
with that person Jo,

608
00:52:08,258 --> 00:52:11,501
his intention is to destroy
my Father, that too using me.

609
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:14,541
Are, we starting a company
to destroy anybody?

610
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:17,840
We've to be successful
that only should be our aim.

611
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:19,641
Do you mean to say that,
he must be avoided?

612
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:22,511
If you avoid I will not agree that.

613
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:24,277
It is a matter of great
head ache, just get lost!

614
00:52:25,208 --> 00:52:26,551
There is no concern
here on my likes.

615
00:52:26,943 --> 00:52:29,219
Lot of unnecessary problems.

616
00:52:29,713 --> 00:52:34,856
This is no unnecessary problem.
We don't want his help.

617
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:41,397
Yes Sharath, Father
has told us he would help us,

618
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:43,664
let us meet him once again.

619
00:52:44,294 --> 00:52:46,205
This is the confidence!

620
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:55,550
This should be the name of the
dream team, 'Confident Group'

621
00:52:55,639 --> 00:52:59,018
Confident, the name is good,

622
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:04,416
but this self-confidence should be
there for getting the work order also.

623
00:53:06,483 --> 00:53:08,053
Uncle, that is already there.

624
00:53:09,052 --> 00:53:12,590
One foreign company had assigned
Anu's team, to develop a soft-ware.

625
00:53:13,924 --> 00:53:16,734
We are going to start this
company, starting with that work.

626
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:18,839
That order is still there, is it not?

627
00:53:18,929 --> 00:53:20,306
Won't they change
the word of promise?

628
00:53:22,165 --> 00:53:23,109
No Father.

629
00:53:23,266 --> 00:53:24,870
Then I'm also confident.

630
00:53:25,001 --> 00:53:27,845
You people go there and
strengthen it once again

631
00:53:27,971 --> 00:53:29,712
money will be always ready here.

632
00:53:31,841 --> 00:53:35,152
I have assigned this
assignment to Anu,

633
00:53:35,245 --> 00:53:37,452
when you were
in Info Solutions. Now,

634
00:53:43,853 --> 00:53:45,890
We're the ones who are
going to develop that project.

635
00:54:24,527 --> 00:54:27,064
There will be several doors
which can be closed by you.

636
00:54:27,197 --> 00:54:31,270
But here, there are lots of
doors which cannot be opened.

637
00:54:31,501 --> 00:54:33,378
Even if you intend to,
don't forget that.

638
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:39,409
I told you once. Enmity and
friendship should be with equals.

639
00:54:39,709 --> 00:54:41,245
Otherwise it is total destruction.

640
00:54:58,928 --> 00:55:01,807
Never leave a single company,
because we do not know from

641
00:55:01,931 --> 00:55:05,242
which company we'll
get a favorable reply.

642
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:10,635
<i>$11224.</i>

643
00:55:52,682 --> 00:55:56,220
"Time has come for the
pearls to arise from shells."

644
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:59,224
"As the colors of
various kinds spreads."

645
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:06,103
"As the sky remains close to us.
As a sparrow, as a bird to fly off."

646
00:56:06,629 --> 00:56:11,408
"At the door step, with the gold,
with flower, dawn at a distance...

647
00:56:11,501 --> 00:56:14,914
you come along."

648
00:56:55,478 --> 00:56:59,858
"On the branches can
make a good nest."

649
00:56:59,983 --> 00:57:03,590
"Give me the twigs and slings."

650
00:57:04,154 --> 00:57:12,869
"Tomorrow our world is ours.
. We'll shower the love."

651
00:57:13,062 --> 00:57:18,136
"Vanish not. The beautiful
dreams never to perish."

652
00:57:18,334 --> 00:57:22,612
"As colorful as the flowers."

653
00:58:02,045 --> 00:58:10,692
"How long is this waiting?
For the seeds to sprout to trees."

654
00:58:11,187 --> 00:58:15,863
"To see the clouds
and to flower tomorrow."

655
00:58:16,025 --> 00:58:19,973
"We will remain staying upright."

656
00:58:20,563 --> 00:58:24,909
"Bravery! Changes the doctrines."

657
00:58:25,068 --> 00:58:29,517
"As it smiles at times."

658
00:58:31,908 --> 00:58:34,286
"As the colors of
various kinds spreads"

659
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:36,855
"As the sky remains close to us."

660
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:40,859
"As a sparrow, as a bird to fly off."

661
00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:47,931
"At the door step, with the gold,
with flower, dawn at a distance,

662
00:58:48,091 --> 00:58:50,298
you come along."

663
00:59:08,845 --> 00:59:15,626
Hallo boss, it is me Jo. Hallo
can you hear where are you?

664
00:59:16,452 --> 00:59:19,228
Then come this way,
I'm also getting ready to go.

665
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:24,236
What? Even if it is to the bar,
you can go after dropping me.

666
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:38,143
You don't have to take trouble
in dropping or picking Jo,

667
00:59:38,274 --> 00:59:39,548
from somewhere, <i>I will</i> do it.

668
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:49,962
I'm not saying, by forgetting
the favors, boss did to me;

669
00:59:50,119 --> 00:59:53,066
you should not interfere
in the matters of sister.

670
00:59:53,723 --> 00:59:56,397
If there is any matter, of concern
I'll come to your house and meet.

671
00:59:56,526 --> 00:59:58,369
Or we will meet at the office.

672
00:59:58,628 --> 01:00:01,040
Boss, you need not
have to come here.

673
01:00:02,732 --> 01:00:06,839
Wait boss, let me say.

674
01:00:07,737 --> 01:00:10,308
I've told him to come here.

675
01:00:10,473 --> 01:00:12,783
That is the reason
why I had to tell like this.

676
01:00:14,043 --> 01:00:16,580
Jo, whatever care and concern,
you have on me the same...

677
01:00:16,713 --> 01:00:20,092
I have it to you also, I have
not granted it, to anyone.

678
01:00:20,249 --> 01:00:23,093
Is it by granting it, to anyone,
boss is doing all this to you?

679
01:00:23,486 --> 01:00:26,296
As a person like him had
come to your life,

680
01:00:26,589 --> 01:00:28,432
we have reached a position like this.

681
01:00:28,591 --> 01:00:32,061
Yes! Don't let the people to say,
it is because of a sister like this.

682
01:00:40,336 --> 01:00:42,077
Jo, where are you going?

683
01:00:42,338 --> 01:00:47,686
To our old house. There, no one will
be present, to insult and prevent Boss.

684
01:00:49,445 --> 01:00:51,652
Now you are going back
as per your likes,

685
01:00:51,781 --> 01:00:53,818
so the coming back
should be also like that.

686
01:00:55,952 --> 01:00:58,523
Never except that
I'll come and call you.

687
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:27,459
Hey! This is the gang of
those guys! Turn the vehicle.

688
01:01:32,288 --> 01:01:33,528
They are right behind!

689
01:01:39,028 --> 01:01:44,028
<i>$11224.</i>

690
01:03:07,283 --> 01:03:09,524
Mani! Take them to the hospital, go.

691
01:03:12,522 --> 01:03:19,030
Leave me, my hard
disc. Jabbar our hard disc.

692
01:04:11,948 --> 01:04:14,724
I had developed a soft-ware,
with a special team...

693
01:04:14,784 --> 01:04:17,628
he snatched that by
beating me up by goondas.

694
01:04:17,954 --> 01:04:21,367
What I can't understand
is why did you develop?

695
01:04:21,490 --> 01:04:25,165
This soft-ware alone outside,
as we have a team here.

696
01:04:26,829 --> 01:04:29,139
That is because, we have more
than sufficient work load here.

697
01:04:29,265 --> 01:04:31,267
For that, reason I
have outsourced it.

698
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:36,816
That is not the reason; you don't
trust me or my team. For that reason.

699
01:04:36,939 --> 01:04:41,513
Without discussing with
anybody and you did that secretly.

700
01:04:41,577 --> 01:04:45,457
If I have done that secretly, that
is for the benefit of the company.

701
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:48,726
Even now she is not
blaming her Father,

702
01:04:48,784 --> 01:04:50,491
who snatched it, she is blaming me.

703
01:04:52,955 --> 01:04:57,495
Is this the secret soft- ware that my
Father had snatched from you?

704
01:04:58,427 --> 01:05:01,965
Take it. Bose had taken it
back from that goondas.

705
01:05:08,104 --> 01:05:11,244
There is no surprise that my
Father does all this kind of things.

706
01:05:11,474 --> 01:05:15,616
But when you do, this kind of clad
stand deal, by being so close.

707
01:05:39,568 --> 01:05:41,104
Do I have to go and check it out?

708
01:05:41,337 --> 01:05:45,513
No need, you pour a peg
and mix it and make it ready.

709
01:05:45,641 --> 01:05:46,881
I'll go and check it out.

710
01:05:58,087 --> 01:06:00,897
With all this bag and all
where are you coming from?

711
01:06:01,023 --> 01:06:03,435
Not coming back, but about to go.

712
01:06:03,559 --> 01:06:07,769
To Bombay, I got the
air hostess selection.

713
01:06:08,431 --> 01:06:11,708
At the Malaysian Airways,
now going for the training after that.

714
01:06:11,901 --> 01:06:14,177
Soon there will be posting also.

715
01:06:19,675 --> 01:06:22,349
Hey you! Why do you
want to insert your filthy hand"

716
01:06:22,545 --> 01:06:23,649
in the unnecessary places?

717
01:06:23,879 --> 01:06:24,949
Now things turned like that is it not?

718
01:06:25,081 --> 01:06:26,424
When a good opportunity came,
our hands are no more required!

719
01:06:26,582 --> 01:06:28,027
But for all other things, needs both
my left hand and right hand.

720
01:06:28,184 --> 01:06:29,322
You stupid fellow
is this the way to talk?

721
01:06:29,452 --> 01:06:30,931
What happened to
your hands, my good heavens!

722
01:06:31,087 --> 01:06:32,327
A small accident in the hand.

723
01:06:32,455 --> 01:06:33,900
Because of that, I'm the
one, who is handling the Bose.

724
01:06:34,090 --> 01:06:37,367
Before I handle you, you go inside!

725
01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:39,531
Why is that? I handle everything,
even without Bose telling me.

726
01:06:39,662 --> 01:06:41,664
Don't beat me.
I told you to arrange something and...

727
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:46,746
Did you tell everyone about
the news you got the job?

728
01:06:48,070 --> 01:06:52,177
No, I've only Bose to inform.

729
01:07:01,851 --> 01:07:03,296
Mani!
I'm coming.

730
01:07:04,253 --> 01:07:08,633
That is not possible, must meet
Sharath and inform him and go.

731
01:07:08,758 --> 01:07:10,567
Hey Mani!
I'm here! Open the mouth!

732
01:07:10,693 --> 01:07:13,401
What is this?
Whisky.

733
01:07:13,529 --> 01:07:14,906
Who asked for this now?

734
01:07:15,031 --> 01:07:15,873
Called me Mani!

735
01:07:15,998 --> 01:07:17,602
Immediately on calling
Mani will you bring this?

736
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:19,008
Usually I used to do like that.

737
01:07:19,135 --> 01:07:23,743
Now it is not like that, you keep it
there, take Jo and go to Sharath's office.

738
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:26,547
From there, drop at the
airport and then come back.

739
01:07:27,176 --> 01:07:29,019
In between isthere
any urgent work?

740
01:07:29,211 --> 01:07:29,882
Get lost man!

741
01:07:53,102 --> 01:07:54,410
Sharath will you come with me?

742
01:08:08,384 --> 01:08:11,228
Why you are sitting here
as the party is going on there?

743
01:08:11,387 --> 01:08:12,388
No, nothing at all.

744
01:08:12,555 --> 01:08:21,134
I've no part in that success. Bose
had called, he told about your job.

745
01:08:21,263 --> 01:08:22,833
Haven't you met Sharath and told?

746
01:08:23,032 --> 01:08:27,777
No, he is busy is it not? Anu,
you tell to him and Chinnu.

747
01:08:29,071 --> 01:08:29,981
Okay.

748
01:08:31,006 --> 01:08:36,217
Hey Jo, on coming afterjoining you
must give a party like this. Hear that!

749
01:08:49,058 --> 01:08:51,834
Leave me, I'll stand up.
Sir get up.

750
01:08:54,096 --> 01:08:55,700
I must see him, leave me.

751
01:09:01,370 --> 01:09:03,941
No need Menon sir
enough, we will go.

752
01:09:04,106 --> 01:09:05,380
Move back I say!

753
01:09:05,474 --> 01:09:08,683
You and your lad had
snatched that soft-ware;

754
01:09:09,345 --> 01:09:13,816
I had developed that
for my major client.

755
01:09:14,250 --> 01:09:20,223
In that deal as you got crores,
I have lost my credibility.

756
01:09:20,789 --> 01:09:24,327
I became a robber, a
cheat in IT world.

757
01:09:24,527 --> 01:09:30,000
Now I'm not position
to hold enmity with you!

758
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:32,442
Because, You and
me are not equals!

759
01:09:41,777 --> 01:09:45,554
Yea, what you said is right, the
enmity and friendship should be...

760
01:09:45,681 --> 01:09:51,688
with equals. Not with the
one who is perished.

761
01:09:54,723 --> 01:09:56,999
Chinnu do notjustify him.

762
01:09:57,126 --> 01:09:59,572
The software developed
by my Father's company,

763
01:09:59,695 --> 01:10:01,197
he gave money and stole that.

764
01:10:01,530 --> 01:10:04,534
Stolen, as told by you Father,
is it not? This is business,

765
01:10:04,633 --> 01:10:07,239
...as we have offered
more than what,

766
01:10:07,369 --> 01:10:08,677
- Info Solutions has
offered, they gave to us.

767
01:10:08,837 --> 01:10:10,407
If he wanted it, he must
have offered more money

768
01:10:10,506 --> 01:10:11,484
and should be regained.

769
01:10:12,675 --> 01:10:13,676
He!' you, keep quite!

770
01:10:13,842 --> 01:10:15,583
Hey girl! When we
started this company,

771
01:10:15,711 --> 01:10:17,691
what all games he
played ,to prevent it.

772
01:10:17,746 --> 01:10:21,159
When I got an opportunity to
destroy his company, I also tried.

773
01:10:21,884 --> 01:10:25,263
My intention was to
destroy him, who ruined my life.

774
01:10:26,222 --> 01:10:28,395
For that you shouldn't
have joined with me.

775
01:10:28,557 --> 01:10:31,265
Who had joined, did
I come to you for help?

776
01:10:34,029 --> 01:10:35,303
You should not talk un gratefulness.

777
01:10:35,431 --> 01:10:37,604
She came all by her
own will, so what?

778
01:10:37,833 --> 01:10:39,972
Yes that is the mistake I did.

779
01:10:42,071 --> 01:10:44,483
I do not regret on
your Fathers Failure.

780
01:10:46,642 --> 01:10:49,122
Now what is the difference
between him and my Father?

781
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:50,155
An u, leave it.

782
01:10:50,379 --> 01:10:52,825
I have not spared my Father, who
did a mistake, then why not him?

783
01:10:52,982 --> 01:10:54,825
The one who has got no
ethics in life, an un grateful one.

784
01:10:58,454 --> 01:11:00,798
With him and me will
not go together here.

785
01:11:01,023 --> 01:11:03,264
You must tell now, who
is required here, among us.

786
01:11:03,392 --> 01:11:04,769
Both of you must be here.

787
01:11:04,927 --> 01:11:08,739
Now, that is not possible, either me
or her. You decide who should be here.

788
01:11:08,864 --> 01:11:10,673
Will you stop it? Let me call Bose.

789
01:11:10,799 --> 01:11:12,904
Why do want to call that person?
To tell me to go out.

790
01:11:13,035 --> 01:11:14,275
Bose will not say like that.

791
01:11:14,470 --> 01:11:16,313
If he says like that,
should I go out? Tell that.

792
01:11:16,405 --> 01:11:17,543
All that I cannot tell now.

793
01:11:17,706 --> 01:11:19,447
Let the Bose decide
what should be done.

794
01:11:23,545 --> 01:11:24,956
What should I tell?

795
01:11:25,047 --> 01:11:27,425
Whatever Bose, says,
both will obey.

796
01:11:28,384 --> 01:11:30,386
And will see that things like
this will not happen again.

797
01:11:31,887 --> 01:11:34,060
Even if you, do like that, that
will not remain for a longer period.

798
01:11:35,391 --> 01:11:38,861
Again there will be eruptions,
the relationships will sway.

799
01:11:39,495 --> 01:11:41,873
So it is better for the company
as well as for you that...

800
01:11:41,997 --> 01:11:43,442
one of you better go out!

801
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:49,941
To solve these kind of issues,
Achu is the best. I'll call Achu!

802
01:12:26,141 --> 01:12:31,141
Chinnu, whatAchu says is, the
person who should go out is...Anu!

803
01:12:40,756 --> 01:12:42,531
That is also my opinion.

804
01:12:50,299 --> 01:12:53,906
Bose, can't we decide that
no one should go out?

805
01:12:54,670 --> 01:12:59,619
I told my opinion, the rest of the
things, Chinnu, you decide.

806
01:13:23,899 --> 01:13:27,142
You are going from here,
not as an end of your carrier.

807
01:13:27,269 --> 01:13:29,647
Somewhere, there will be a
new opportunity waiting for you.

808
01:13:29,805 --> 01:13:32,581
This problem can be
solved within seven days.

809
01:13:33,142 --> 01:13:36,180
Don't come near me,
saying this seven days.

810
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:06,376
I will come now, one second.

811
01:14:07,976 --> 01:14:12,976
<i>$11224.</i>

812
01:14:47,783 --> 01:14:50,457
Both of you should be present for
the inauguration of our Indian office.

813
01:15:00,996 --> 01:15:01,974
We'll go.

814
01:15:44,473 --> 01:15:48,546
Hey Mani come! Take the trolley.

815
01:15:54,683 --> 01:15:59,257
Once Sharath was ready to die,
for not, able to see the, sorrows to Jo.

816
01:15:59,855 --> 01:16:02,358
Now he is living only
to instill pain on Jo.

817
01:16:03,458 --> 01:16:06,530
These are the amusements
which time had kept for us.

818
01:16:17,573 --> 01:16:22,215
Hey, I have not come to
see, there is some other person.

819
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:33,097
Jo when did you come? Come.

820
01:16:35,724 --> 01:16:37,135
I'll wait down stairs.

821
01:16:37,292 --> 01:16:39,363
Why is that you go
down stairs? Come inside.

822
01:16:39,761 --> 01:16:41,672
No, I have to make some calls.

823
01:16:41,763 --> 01:16:43,538
Take your own time
I'll be there, down stairs.

824
01:16:50,839 --> 01:16:55,288
Within two weeks, since I left what
had happened to you, people?

825
01:17:01,183 --> 01:17:02,662
What is it Anu?

826
01:17:09,858 --> 01:17:13,396
Jo, did you hear that, Bose has
given me one week time for me also.

827
01:17:13,662 --> 01:17:17,303
Reallyl, if Bose has told
seven days it is for sure!

828
01:17:17,432 --> 01:17:19,241
But, now only two
days are left behind.

829
01:17:19,368 --> 01:17:21,143
Two days are there, is it not?

830
01:17:21,236 --> 01:17:23,079
More than that, within that time,
person will come, is it not?

831
01:17:23,972 --> 01:17:25,474
Then, where else Jo wants to go?

832
01:17:26,174 --> 01:17:28,780
Drop me at the hotel
where our crew is staying.

833
01:17:39,254 --> 01:17:40,426
Will go.

834
01:18:00,676 --> 01:18:04,351
Like this one, you are also going to
be one of the biggest IT firms in Kerala.

835
01:18:07,783 --> 01:18:10,821
If you have any issues,
meet the regional head here.

836
01:18:29,938 --> 01:18:33,476
Sharath wait where are
you going? Sharath, stay there!

837
01:18:43,051 --> 01:18:45,088
He is still with that same grudge.

838
01:18:45,353 --> 01:18:49,426
You make him understand, I do not
have hatred or enmity to anybody.

839
01:18:49,958 --> 01:18:52,939
I'm now this companies
Asian Regional head.

840
01:18:53,095 --> 01:18:57,271
As long as you are perfect
with the dealing of my company.

841
01:18:57,399 --> 01:19:00,471
The personal issues will
not affect in the business.

842
01:19:01,269 --> 01:19:02,839
All that is not in my mind now.

843
01:19:03,271 --> 01:19:07,515
I'm really thrilled, you in
a big position like this.

844
01:19:12,047 --> 01:19:15,256
Actually it was only yesterday Anoop
called me and told to take the charge.

845
01:19:15,450 --> 01:19:18,021
Only now, it was a piece of mind
to me, I will go and come later.

846
01:19:18,754 --> 01:19:21,428
I'll make him understand
and bring him.

847
01:19:21,823 --> 01:19:23,769
No matter, how good we perform,

848
01:19:23,859 --> 01:19:26,339
she can very well
blacklist us and reject us!

849
01:19:26,461 --> 01:19:28,407
After knowing all this, why
should we give her a chance?

850
01:19:28,530 --> 01:19:30,806
An u, will never do like that,
this was started by her also.

851
01:19:30,966 --> 01:19:32,309
Just because of that
she will do like that.

852
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:34,175
You are thinking like this, because
of the hatred you have towards her.

853
01:19:34,269 --> 01:19:36,476
Chinnu, no need of
much argument on this,

854
01:19:36,538 --> 01:19:38,347
her company is not the
only big company in US.

855
01:19:38,507 --> 01:19:40,453
If we deny them <i>,</i>
nothing will happen to us.

856
01:19:40,542 --> 01:19:43,318
Now we have a big
support from Meg B.

857
01:19:43,378 --> 01:19:46,359
There is no difficulty in getting in to
an exclusive contract with them.

858
01:19:46,481 --> 01:19:48,757
All this should not be
decided by you and me alone.

859
01:19:48,884 --> 01:19:52,889
Then who? Is it her'?
Whom are you calling?

860
01:19:53,054 --> 01:19:54,499
Tell me whom are you calling?

861
01:19:54,689 --> 01:19:58,034
Hallo Bose, now where are you?
I must meet you urgently.

862
01:19:59,161 --> 01:20:02,301
One Bose, for everything, one Bose!

863
01:20:13,575 --> 01:20:15,919
Kununichettan, what
Sharath says is also sensible.

864
01:20:17,712 --> 01:20:21,091
I'm not telling this on the basis
of what had happened now.

865
01:20:21,583 --> 01:20:24,063
He is an opportunist!

866
01:20:30,926 --> 01:20:35,068
This is my daughter's life, no Father
will allow the daughter to weep,

867
01:20:35,197 --> 01:20:36,141
and will not allow to be thrown.

868
01:20:36,231 --> 01:20:39,144
On this case, Bose sir you
should not insist on me.

869
01:20:39,301 --> 01:20:42,771
Only one favor, for me
and my daughter.

870
01:20:42,904 --> 01:20:45,145
Reconcile, the profit of this
company and give him

871
01:20:45,273 --> 01:20:48,550
what he deserves
with no penny less!

872
01:20:48,710 --> 01:20:52,123
And kindly help to get
rid of this person somehow!

873
01:20:59,754 --> 01:21:02,030
Sharath, wait!

874
01:21:02,157 --> 01:21:02,965
No need,

875
01:21:03,124 --> 01:21:05,798
I know what you are going to say.
Is it not, that matter, of seven days?

876
01:21:06,261 --> 01:21:09,003
First of all, try to bring the wife
beside, without losing from life.

877
01:21:09,297 --> 01:21:12,972
After that think of interfering
in other life and solving it!

878
01:21:27,782 --> 01:21:29,819
Is this the house of Bose sir?

879
01:21:30,485 --> 01:21:34,695
My God are we going
to stay in this house?

880
01:21:34,823 --> 01:21:38,532
There is no 'block' here, without
block how can one give miscall?

881
01:21:38,727 --> 01:21:39,762
Giving miscall?

882
01:21:39,928 --> 01:21:42,636
If somebody wants to call us,
we have to give miscall is it not?

883
01:21:42,764 --> 01:21:46,143
Banumathy Amma, Keep the phone
aside and take this entire luggage inside!

884
01:21:50,739 --> 01:21:53,310
Where is the child's
room? Is it down stairs?

885
01:21:53,842 --> 01:21:56,550
Down stairs room...Child's
room...Is that not upstairs?

886
01:21:57,345 --> 01:22:01,953
What? Child, here the room in the
bottom is on top! What to do now?

887
01:22:02,083 --> 01:22:04,324
Banumathy Am ma,
keep that upstairs.

888
01:22:04,653 --> 01:22:06,826
What child, have the
wife of Boss sir returned?

889
01:22:06,988 --> 01:22:09,434
Hey Anu madam, why is she here?

890
01:22:09,624 --> 01:22:12,833
Ah! Mani, are you standing there,
watching, come and help?

891
01:22:12,961 --> 01:22:14,565
Who is this, bag and luggage's?

892
01:22:14,663 --> 01:22:15,266
Ours!

893
01:22:15,497 --> 01:22:18,000
From now on, I and Banumathy
Am ma are going to stay here.

894
01:22:18,099 --> 01:22:20,579
Where? Here, along with Bose!

895
01:22:28,877 --> 01:22:29,651
Hey girl, stop there!

896
01:22:31,579 --> 01:22:32,956
Here he goes!

897
01:22:39,654 --> 01:22:42,066
Don't think you have
escaped, you filthy!

898
01:22:42,190 --> 01:22:44,067
All this havoc is about,
a cat which got inside!

899
01:22:44,192 --> 01:22:46,672
The rest of the things
can be guessed!

900
01:22:47,729 --> 01:22:48,469
Hey Mani!

901
01:22:50,398 --> 01:22:53,277
I told you, filthy, I don't want
any animals other than you,

902
01:22:53,401 --> 01:22:54,778
didn't I tell you that?

903
01:22:54,836 --> 01:22:56,975
That cat bearing the
name of your Mother

904
01:22:57,072 --> 01:22:58,983
broke one bottle of whisky of mine!

905
01:22:59,107 --> 01:23:00,848
Your three months' salary is cut!

906
01:23:00,976 --> 01:23:01,920
Three months' salary!

907
01:23:02,043 --> 01:23:04,250
My three months' salary is it not
worth enough for a bottle of whisk y!

908
01:23:04,379 --> 01:23:07,258
Go and ask that cat! If you
don't throw that thing from here,

909
01:23:07,382 --> 01:23:08,759
I will also throw you out,
along with that!

910
01:23:08,883 --> 01:23:10,760
Now, no problem
if you throw me out!

911
01:23:10,919 --> 01:23:12,023
There are sufficient
people here, is it not?

912
01:23:12,187 --> 01:23:13,495
What people?
Look, here!

913
01:23:17,692 --> 01:23:19,171
Why is she here?

914
01:23:19,361 --> 01:23:22,899
Child the room in the upstairs is full
of...Is this th Bose, the owner'?

915
01:23:23,298 --> 01:23:24,538
When did you come?

916
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:28,579
Hey, I need a broom, to
clean; it is full of dust there.

917
01:23:28,670 --> 01:23:29,375
Broom!

918
01:23:30,071 --> 01:23:32,051
Is this your Mother,
who is dead, this oldie?

919
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:33,947
Bose that is Banumathy Am ma,

920
01:23:34,075 --> 01:23:35,713
she was in our house
right from childhood.

921
01:23:35,910 --> 01:23:36,354
Come!

922
01:23:39,414 --> 01:23:43,624
Then which is this house? Mani
where have you, put me to stay?

923
01:23:43,752 --> 01:23:46,130
This is Bose's house!
Then why are this people here?

924
01:23:46,354 --> 01:23:47,662
They came by mistake.

925
01:23:47,789 --> 01:23:49,894
Then go and tell, the
house is changed for them.

926
01:23:50,058 --> 01:23:53,801
Hey, wait, house is changed!

927
01:23:53,928 --> 01:23:56,340
This is my house, hey you!
Make them understand!

928
01:23:56,965 --> 01:23:59,809
I'll make you understand,
this is Bose's house,

929
01:24:00,101 --> 01:24:02,172
as I was insisted on
staying here, and I came.

930
01:24:02,303 --> 01:24:03,714
Who insisted? Hey you!

931
01:24:03,805 --> 01:24:05,409
Why did you insist these
people and brought them here?

932
01:24:05,507 --> 01:24:07,487
I did not insist anybody!

933
01:24:07,542 --> 01:24:12,514
It was not Mani who
insisted but it was Achu!

934
01:24:13,381 --> 01:24:14,121
Who?

935
01:24:14,749 --> 01:24:19,255
Yes, The Achu, the one, who
is Aswathy Chandra Bose!

936
01:24:20,755 --> 01:24:24,293
Achu is going from Bose's
life and from now on.

937
01:24:24,392 --> 01:24:26,065
I have to take care of everything;

938
01:24:26,227 --> 01:24:29,140
Achu had phoned
me and insisted on me.

939
01:24:29,364 --> 01:24:31,571
A lie! What you are telling is true lie!

940
01:24:31,699 --> 01:24:33,610
If you want you can call Achu!
To know whether it is a lie or not.

941
01:24:33,735 --> 01:24:35,646
I know my Achu!
I don't have to call!

942
01:24:35,703 --> 01:24:37,478
You, won't get, even if you
call, there is no block here!

943
01:24:37,572 --> 01:24:39,051
You oldie! Did anyone
speak about the block?

944
01:24:39,140 --> 01:24:39,880
Banu mathy Am m a,!

945
01:24:39,941 --> 01:24:41,249
You go and clean that room!

946
01:24:41,443 --> 01:24:43,150
Mani, go and help sister!

947
01:24:43,278 --> 01:24:44,450
Take this!
Take this, bag also.

948
01:24:45,380 --> 01:24:49,055
Hey stay there, are
you to obey me or wayfarers, ..

949
01:24:49,150 --> 01:24:50,891
Are you given food for that?

950
01:24:51,019 --> 01:24:53,727
Mani is now obeying Achu not me.

951
01:24:53,855 --> 01:24:55,766
Even, Bose won't cross
beyond what Achu says.

952
01:24:55,924 --> 01:24:57,870
Then why do you want to protest,
this one alone? Mani you go!

953
01:24:58,059 --> 01:24:59,538
So that is the intention is it not?

954
01:24:59,794 --> 01:25:02,900
Creating a false story in the
name of Ach u, to enter here.

955
01:25:03,031 --> 01:25:06,171
The false stories in the name of
Achu is being told and created,

956
01:25:06,267 --> 01:25:07,871
not by me, it is Bose!

957
01:25:07,969 --> 01:25:13,146
What Bose says is all lie; whatever
that was told about Achu is all very lie!

958
01:25:13,241 --> 01:25:17,917
Seeing Achu and talking over the
phone is all stories that does not exists!

959
01:25:24,119 --> 01:25:25,063
Then?

960
01:25:31,059 --> 01:25:36,600
Your Achu is not alive; your Achu
expired in an accident which

961
01:25:36,764 --> 01:25:41,338
occurred three years back,
right in front of your eyes!

962
01:25:46,808 --> 01:25:51,757
The biggest, cursed moments in my
life, which I'm trying and desiring to

963
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:56,351
forget, you brought
those moments back!

964
01:26:03,057 --> 01:26:04,764
Yes, my Achu is dead!

965
01:26:06,594 --> 01:26:10,599
That is for you and for other!
But for me she is not dead!

966
01:26:10,698 --> 01:26:13,235
No death can pluck
Achu away from me!

967
01:26:13,401 --> 01:26:15,677
Now Achu is not living in your world!

968
01:26:15,770 --> 01:26:20,719
Here, inside me! Not you! None
can depart my Achu from here.

969
01:26:22,744 --> 01:26:23,950
Leave from this house!

970
01:26:24,179 --> 01:26:26,955
When I come back, you
must not be seen in this vicinity!

971
01:26:43,464 --> 01:26:45,842
Banumathy Am ma!
What is it child?

972
01:26:47,335 --> 01:26:49,315
Banymathy Am ma, you wait here,

973
01:26:49,437 --> 01:26:52,111
you call me when the
Bose's vehicle comes.

974
01:27:30,478 --> 01:27:34,324
Chandruoos come fast, rain!

975
01:27:35,149 --> 01:27:36,628
Ch and ruoos

976
01:27:39,454 --> 01:27:40,432
Close it!

977
01:27:41,956 --> 01:27:45,301
It is raining heavily outside;
we'll go and watch it.

978
01:27:45,426 --> 01:27:47,337
What are you doing,
are we children?

979
01:27:47,528 --> 01:27:51,305
To get wet in the rain, won't
allow others to do the work!

980
01:27:51,432 --> 01:27:52,467
Go and dry your head!

981
01:27:53,801 --> 01:27:56,975
When will her mind grow in
propotion to her age, my God?

982
01:28:24,132 --> 01:28:31,710
I know, how much my Achoos miss
the native place. What can I do?

983
01:28:32,140 --> 01:28:33,517
What is of ours, is all here, is it not?

984
01:28:33,608 --> 01:28:35,178
The period, till we stay here,

985
01:28:35,343 --> 01:28:37,846
we must spend the
time for the business.

986
01:28:38,012 --> 01:28:40,686
We don't have a
single minute to waste.

987
01:28:42,550 --> 01:28:46,657
After that we'll start the life.

988
01:28:47,822 --> 01:28:53,773
A time for business and a time, to
live. Is there, anything like that?

989
01:28:55,063 --> 01:29:00,445
However busy we may be,
must find time to live happily.

990
01:29:01,336 --> 01:29:05,341
Or else, what is earned like
this, to spend this, this life

991
01:29:05,473 --> 01:29:08,181
Span might not be sufficient!

992
01:29:15,483 --> 01:29:20,483
<i>$11224.</i>

993
01:30:10,204 --> 01:30:12,115
Is the movie over? Then what?

994
01:30:12,206 --> 01:30:14,243
Ended it!

995
01:30:38,166 --> 01:30:41,773
Didn't I tell you it was
an important matter.

996
01:30:41,936 --> 01:30:44,644
Othenlvise, I won't have
gone in between the movie.

997
01:30:44,739 --> 01:30:46,685
All this importance
is all decided by us.

998
01:30:46,841 --> 01:30:49,219
Chandruods priority
is still money making.

999
01:30:49,410 --> 01:30:53,051
That is why, all other happiness,
seems like a waste and silly!

1000
01:30:53,981 --> 01:30:57,258
It has become as if, there
is no life beyond business,

1001
01:30:57,385 --> 01:31:00,127
for Chandruoos, like my Daddy!

1002
01:31:00,855 --> 01:31:05,600
Don't speak ill of your Daddy like
this! An ordinary IT professional like me,

1003
01:31:05,726 --> 01:31:08,764
He has consented just
because of the fact you loved me.

1004
01:31:08,863 --> 01:31:11,309
When he gave the charge
of his entire business,

1005
01:31:11,399 --> 01:31:12,969
do I have to safeguard that trust?

1006
01:31:13,134 --> 01:31:14,875
That is not the greatness of Daddy!

1007
01:31:17,104 --> 01:31:19,448
When I loved Chandruoos simplicity,

1008
01:31:19,540 --> 01:31:22,544
but Dad saw, Chandruoos
skill and brilliance.

1009
01:31:24,178 --> 01:31:26,249
Chandruoos, you have
made the company reach,

1010
01:31:26,380 --> 01:31:28,860
more than what
Dad had imagined.

1011
01:31:29,550 --> 01:31:36,263
But from, what I have
desired, is very <i>,</i> very much low,

1012
01:31:36,457 --> 01:31:38,733
my life with Chandruoos is.

1013
01:31:45,366 --> 01:31:49,178
It is true Achu, what you
have told is somewhat true!

1014
01:31:49,470 --> 01:31:53,441
The business which was handed
over by your Father, I cared all the more.

1015
01:31:54,141 --> 01:31:58,112
ButAchu never did I
love business more than you.

1016
01:32:00,081 --> 01:32:02,118
Chandruoos, are you
still staying there itself?

1017
01:32:02,350 --> 01:32:05,854
I told that out of my grief.
Sorry for hurting you.

1018
01:32:06,053 --> 01:32:09,523
ForAchu to talk in that manner,
how much should I have hurt you?

1019
01:32:13,761 --> 01:32:15,399
Forget it!

1020
01:32:15,730 --> 01:32:20,679
Now what I'm going to tell is not
without a reason, we are

1021
01:32:20,801 --> 01:32:25,409
going from here to Achoos
favorite native place, Cochin.

1022
01:32:27,108 --> 01:32:31,147
The business and office what is in
here can be managed from the

1023
01:32:31,245 --> 01:32:34,818
native place. I have done
all the arrangements for that.

1024
01:32:34,882 --> 01:32:40,093
So, next week we are
packing from here, to Cochin.

1025
01:32:57,238 --> 01:32:59,081
What is the need for such
an expensive car like this?

1026
01:32:59,240 --> 01:33:00,446
For whom, to show?

1027
01:33:08,783 --> 01:33:10,888
I want one, like that!

1028
01:33:11,819 --> 01:33:12,695
A Cycle!

1029
01:33:15,089 --> 01:33:19,196
My biggest wish is to
reach home at the earliest.

1030
01:33:28,135 --> 01:33:32,550
What are you doing, remain silent?

1031
01:33:33,808 --> 01:33:38,188
All this time, I was in jail
now let me breathe.

1032
01:33:44,852 --> 01:33:47,355
We'll park this vehicle
and go in an auto.

1033
01:33:47,655 --> 01:33:49,293
Here it starts again,

1034
01:33:49,390 --> 01:33:53,099
do you have silly desires like
this? Achu why are you like this?

1035
01:33:53,327 --> 01:33:55,933
These are all my debts
right from my childhood.

1036
01:33:56,030 --> 01:34:01,480
On seeing other children
going in cycle and auto;

1037
01:34:02,236 --> 01:34:05,149
I used to obstinate a lot!

1038
01:34:10,378 --> 01:34:12,949
My biggest happiness
is my Chandruoos.

1039
01:34:15,650 --> 01:34:18,961
We will not go from
this native place.

1040
01:34:19,086 --> 01:34:24,900
Yes, we will live as
what is desired by Achu. Here!

1041
01:34:34,635 --> 01:34:35,909
Bill this one.

1042
01:34:50,851 --> 01:34:57,791
Bakkar, go and get an auto.
We should not destroy this thrill,

1043
01:34:57,958 --> 01:35:01,667
Today, day time and night till
tomorrow morning we will go in an auto.

1044
01:35:01,762 --> 01:35:09,510
Come will get fresh. Get ready don't
we have to go in an auto, like that!

1045
01:35:11,505 --> 01:35:12,677
Where is Achu?

1046
01:35:13,741 --> 01:35:16,244
Madam is going round
and round in an auto outside,

1047
01:35:16,343 --> 01:35:17,845
told to call, when sir comes.

1048
01:35:18,012 --> 01:35:19,685
No need I'll go.

1049
01:36:06,894 --> 01:36:09,568
As you were always
quarreling with me, Achu,

1050
01:36:09,730 --> 01:36:13,268
I came to know why it
was for, only since you left.

1051
01:36:14,335 --> 01:36:18,477
You, didn't have much time.
You longed to live with me...

1052
01:36:18,672 --> 01:36:24,247
in the allotted time.
I couldn't recognize that!

1053
01:36:30,985 --> 01:36:33,329
You taught to love life.

1054
01:36:33,521 --> 01:36:38,903
Taught values of life.
Taught the littleness of money!

1055
01:36:39,026 --> 01:36:41,165
Taught to do good for all.

1056
01:36:41,462 --> 01:36:45,410
That is all I rendered to
the life of those children.

1057
01:36:45,699 --> 01:36:48,236
Now I'm in pain because of that.

1058
01:36:49,103 --> 01:36:54,746
Achu, as your substitute,
she is trying to enter,in my mind.

1059
01:36:55,276 --> 01:36:58,723
For that reason, Achu,
you do not go from me.

1060
01:37:00,247 --> 01:37:05,959
Somehow let me live with
you and finish off my desires!

How to park this thing in the room?

1082
01:41:27,881 --> 01:41:30,293
Bose, have reached
home, get down!

1083
01:41:35,222 --> 01:41:36,724
Have reached home, get down!

1084
01:41:37,724 --> 01:41:42,002
You go and see whether she
had gone, then only I'll get down.

1085
01:41:42,129 --> 01:41:45,133
She might have left!
Might have left is it not?

1086
01:41:45,299 --> 01:41:48,712
The Bose had left after
saying so strongly.

1087
01:41:48,836 --> 01:41:49,871
Was it told strongly?

1088
01:41:51,939 --> 01:41:53,418
Cat!
Don't step on it!

1089
01:41:53,640 --> 01:41:57,315
From now on all the things should
be told in a strong way, like this.

1090
01:41:57,444 --> 01:42:00,186
Once Bose, is steady then
all ourthings will be steady.

1091
01:42:02,483 --> 01:42:04,986
Look, she is standing here!
Haven't you told that she is gone.

1092
01:42:05,119 --> 01:42:07,360
Don't go wait,sometimes she
might have gone and came back.

1093
01:42:07,488 --> 01:42:08,728
For what?
To say she had gone!

1094
01:42:09,289 --> 01:42:12,634
To say that she is waiting
for you, without sleeping.

1095
01:42:12,759 --> 01:42:15,706
Is she my wife, to wait
for me with out sleeping?

1096
01:42:16,130 --> 01:42:18,838
Not only you, no one will
a substitute for my Achu.

1097
01:42:19,066 --> 01:42:23,981
Since you are a lady,
as it is late at night.

1098
01:42:24,071 --> 01:42:25,414
I'm not sending you from
here. Here in my, this house,

1099
01:42:25,539 --> 01:42:29,282
this is the first and the
last night of hers.

1100
01:42:29,409 --> 01:42:30,615
If you want go and sleep.

1101
01:42:34,181 --> 01:42:35,125
Hey you!

1102
01:42:41,288 --> 01:42:43,268
<i>Anu NM come fast, some'.!</i>

01:42:43,390 --> 01:42:47,839
Taking me to sent out!

1104
01:42:49,963 --> 01:42:53,877
You go and take their bag
and things. Come here, oldy!

1105
01:42:55,302 --> 01:42:57,782
Child, I was stirring confectionery,
made of rava, in the kitchen...

1106
01:42:57,871 --> 01:42:58,941
from there I was taken out.

1107
01:42:59,606 --> 01:43:04,954
Bose, leave her! Leave I say! Don't
have to push out forcefully, we'll go!

1108
01:43:05,078 --> 01:43:06,250
Banu mathy Am ma, com e!

1109
01:43:06,380 --> 01:43:07,051
Go!

1110
01:43:07,681 --> 01:43:10,321
Just tell where you have to be
dropped, will drop you there.

1111
01:43:10,684 --> 01:43:14,063
Enoughlwe don't want your
help. We'll call a taxi and go.

1112
01:43:15,289 --> 01:43:18,600
See, when we show mercy
they will take the advantage!

1113
01:43:18,725 --> 01:43:19,863
When I became strong,
see how they are leaving,

1114
01:43:19,993 --> 01:43:20,733
with the tails buckled!

1115
01:43:20,861 --> 01:43:21,737
I told that yesterday itself, is it not?

1116
01:43:21,828 --> 01:43:22,499
Who is that?

1117
01:43:26,300 --> 01:43:28,075
Hey you, Alight the bag
and luggage of the child.

1118
01:43:28,702 --> 01:43:31,273
Ahha!What a timing
when one is packed,

1119
01:43:31,338 --> 01:43:32,976
the other is unloaded! Really good!

1120
01:43:33,040 --> 01:43:38,080
Bose sir,I came to
handover her here.

1121
01:43:38,212 --> 01:43:40,089
Why such a decision like this?

1122
01:43:40,247 --> 01:43:44,093
Nothing else, after that lad Sharath
was chucked from the company,

1123
01:43:44,184 --> 01:43:45,458
she is frightened like anything.

1124
01:43:45,552 --> 01:43:47,657
I'm also scared, the
boys are of present age,

1125
01:43:47,754 --> 01:43:48,926
if they do something
like an acid bulb or

1126
01:43:48,989 --> 01:43:49,694
Some, mischief's like that.

1127
01:43:49,990 --> 01:43:51,936
I know Sharath he will
not do anything like that.

1128
01:43:52,025 --> 01:43:53,231
Not only that as the
company was started by all,

1129
01:43:53,327 --> 01:43:57,833
she is not capable
enough to run all by herself.

1130
01:43:57,931 --> 01:44:00,104
When she is here, you will have
a supervision on everything

1131
01:44:00,200 --> 01:44:03,181
and I'll have peace of mind also.

1132
01:44:03,237 --> 01:44:05,740
Because, I've trusted
Bose sir and stood for all this.

1133
01:44:05,806 --> 01:44:08,582
Do you have any kind of
inconveniences, if she stays here?

1134
01:44:08,709 --> 01:44:10,416
Nothing only happiness!

1135
01:44:10,844 --> 01:44:15,122
If at all any inconveniences, he will
not say that frankly, that is his nature.

1136
01:44:15,282 --> 01:44:17,353
Okay then I'm not
taking much of the time,

1137
01:44:18,085 --> 01:44:20,793
Hey Pithambaran take the
daughter's luggage inside.

1138
01:44:20,854 --> 01:44:22,162
No need, keep it there,
I'll take it inside.

1139
01:44:22,256 --> 01:44:23,234
Okay then no need
you take the vehicle.

1140
01:44:24,091 --> 01:44:26,435
I'll make visit very
frequently here. Daughter!

1141
01:44:26,560 --> 01:44:27,334
Okay Father. Bye.

1142
01:44:32,032 --> 01:44:33,978
Bose, the next one is coming!

1143
01:44:35,269 --> 01:44:37,749
There is a slight change in the
program, now you are not going!

1144
01:44:37,804 --> 01:44:39,477
Now we are going!
I say you go inside!

1145
01:44:39,673 --> 01:44:41,243
I cannot do that, when
you tell to go out,

1146
01:44:41,341 --> 01:44:42,945
we go and stay when
you tell to stay, we stay.

1147
01:44:43,076 --> 01:44:45,177
Can't you see, Chinnu is here,
when you go she will be alone.

1148
01:44:45,178 --> 01:44:46,714
She is not alone Bose
is there, along with her!

1149
01:44:46,780 --> 01:44:49,158
Then you go let the
Banumathy Am ma stay here.

1150
01:44:49,283 --> 01:44:50,353
I will not stay by
parting with the child.

1151
01:44:50,450 --> 01:44:51,588
Didn't I tell to go inside?

1152
01:44:51,718 --> 01:44:53,891
Child and mother once
again leaves from here,

1153
01:44:53,987 --> 01:44:55,694
I will break both of yours knees.

1154
01:44:55,756 --> 01:44:57,326
Chinnu, call Anu and go inside.

1155
01:44:57,924 --> 01:45:00,404
Sorry Anu if we were little more late,

1156
01:45:00,494 --> 01:45:02,201
Bose would have
chucked you out is it not?

1157
01:45:02,429 --> 01:45:04,102
Even other wise I'll not go from here.

1158
01:45:05,932 --> 01:45:08,003
We must not leave like
that and go our Bose.

1159
01:45:08,568 --> 01:45:11,048
Before coming here and staying in
this house I have thought...

1160
01:45:11,104 --> 01:45:14,108
several times, who is this man to us.

1161
01:45:14,274 --> 01:45:17,619
Why did this person come to
our life? Today you, me,

1162
01:45:17,711 --> 01:45:20,248
Jo and Sharath has reached

1163
01:45:20,347 --> 01:45:21,792
Somewhere in this life because of
this man is it not? A person like that.

1164
01:45:21,982 --> 01:45:24,963
Must not be lend to
alcohol and madness!

1165
01:45:25,385 --> 01:45:29,356
Chinnu we must bring
back Bose, back to life!

1166
01:45:29,790 --> 01:45:32,566
Everybody sees
Bose, as a drunkard

1167
01:45:32,626 --> 01:45:33,764
who has got no discipline, is it not?

1168
01:45:33,860 --> 01:45:34,930
That is a mask.

1169
01:45:35,228 --> 01:45:38,698
No one should come in contact with
the life of Bose and Achu! For that.

1170
01:45:38,965 --> 01:45:42,378
Bose has created a life
style like that, intentionally.

1171
01:45:43,503 --> 01:45:46,814
Which lady is going to come to the
life of a full time drunkard, knowingly!

1172
01:45:46,907 --> 01:45:48,409
That is the brilliance of Bose.

1173
01:45:49,876 --> 01:45:51,947
This is a one
sided agreement, Vinod,

1174
01:45:52,179 --> 01:45:53,749
. in it all the decision
making powers and

1175
01:45:53,847 --> 01:45:55,417
...Benefits are vested on me.

1176
01:45:56,149 --> 01:45:59,858
In nut shell, Sony Zacharia,
writing off the company to me.

1177
01:46:00,721 --> 01:46:03,668
That is because, all the earning of
Sharath is invested in the...

1178
01:46:03,757 --> 01:46:05,236
<i>company that was 'm bankruptcy.</i>

1179
01:46:05,325 --> 01:46:06,963
Today, you have made this
company to this level.

1180
01:46:07,127 --> 01:46:09,664
That is the reason why the
agreement is rewritten like this...

1181
01:46:09,730 --> 01:46:11,141
as instructed by Sony Chayyan.

1182
01:46:11,231 --> 01:46:14,041
Will sign it after the
legal opinion is that enough?

1183
01:46:14,167 --> 01:46:16,841
You give that to me
I'll sign it, right away,

1184
01:46:16,937 --> 01:46:19,884
otherwise the advocates
will find some disputes.

1185
01:46:26,580 --> 01:46:31,461
I've only one demand, the company
started by Sharath.,Confident Group,

1186
01:46:31,551 --> 01:46:34,930
Did it grow to a big company today?
Similarly like that Asten also!

1187
01:46:35,222 --> 01:46:41,832
You have to grow my
Assent, bigger than that!

1188
01:47:05,752 --> 01:47:11,395
If Bose sir is seeing the wife who is
dead, then that is sure she is the ghost.

1189
01:47:13,527 --> 01:47:14,528
A Qhost!

1190
01:47:15,629 --> 01:47:20,601
It was an accidental death, then
those souls will wander in despair!

1191
01:47:21,535 --> 01:47:22,741
Then what my child!

1192
01:47:22,869 --> 01:47:28,285
Along with Bose sir, his wife's soul is
also there with him. That is the reason.

1193
01:47:28,341 --> 01:47:29,911
Why he is seeing
the wife and talking?

1194
01:47:29,976 --> 01:47:32,320
Go and sleep without scaring them!

1195
01:47:32,379 --> 01:47:34,723
There is nothing to
fear, only once who love,

1196
01:47:34,781 --> 01:47:36,556
this dead souls will come searching.

1197
01:47:36,783 --> 01:47:39,423
After my husband expired,
exactly after an year,

1198
01:47:39,553 --> 01:47:42,363
after visiting the temple
festival, I was coming back.

1199
01:47:42,722 --> 01:47:44,963
Like today that day
was also a Friday.

1200
01:47:45,058 --> 01:47:47,504
Then what is it a movie, to get
released on Fridays? Just coning!

1201
01:47:48,395 --> 01:47:50,705
The people who accompanied me,
asked me weather they should drop me,

1202
01:47:50,764 --> 01:47:51,936
I said no need.

1203
01:47:51,998 --> 01:47:55,707
As I entered the house, alone,
there was a smell of good cigar!

1204
01:47:55,969 --> 01:48:00,969
At that moment itself I felt something
fishy!As I entered from the courtyard.

1205
01:48:01,274 --> 01:48:05,916
There he was standing right at the
thresholdlThe moment I saw that.

1206
01:48:05,979 --> 01:48:09,984
A chill sprouted up right from the toe
of my footll was shivering like a stag!

1207
01:48:10,116 --> 01:48:15,998
Then pulling my strength, I asked,
Kunnikannetta, why is that, you came?

1208
01:48:16,089 --> 01:48:20,504
Then he asked me whether, I
had calcium cream in possession,

1209
01:48:20,794 --> 01:48:23,866
As, I told <i>I will</i> go inside and bring it.

1210
01:48:23,964 --> 01:48:25,807
He gave me the way,
without saying anything.

1211
01:48:26,199 --> 01:48:28,770
Immediately I went inside
the house and closed the door.

1212
01:48:28,869 --> 01:48:29,870
Why is that for'? Why
did you close the door?

1213
01:48:29,970 --> 01:48:31,381
Should have given the calcium
cream to Grand Father and left him.

1214
01:48:31,438 --> 01:48:33,042
He'll come here, asking for that!

1215
01:48:33,106 --> 01:48:35,814
No one will come here, there
is already some one here!

1216
01:48:35,909 --> 01:48:36,387
Who?

1217
01:48:36,543 --> 01:48:41,515
The first day I came, I sensed that!
This dogs and cats can see the souls

1218
01:48:41,581 --> 01:48:42,321
That is the reason...

1219
01:48:42,415 --> 01:48:44,895
why Bose sir is trying
to get rid off that cat!

1220
01:48:45,018 --> 01:48:49,763
Banumathy Am ma don't con! How
long I'm with Bose. Haven't seen it!

1221
01:48:49,856 --> 01:48:53,429
You are very energetic,
those people will not see it.

1222
01:48:53,493 --> 01:48:55,131
Is it because the
Bose's body is weak!

1223
01:48:55,195 --> 01:48:59,109
Then what, after drinking a lot,
body is weak, so he will see it!

1224
01:48:59,165 --> 01:49:00,337
Banumathy Am ma! Come!

1225
01:49:01,535 --> 01:49:09,215
Where are you all going? We
will all sleep here, Is this all true?

1226
01:49:11,344 --> 01:49:14,814
Is it not Friday, today? Ho! No
the current is gone! My God!

1227
01:49:47,080 --> 01:49:51,153
Banumathy Am ma, my body
is also weak, I can see it!

1228
01:49:51,384 --> 01:49:53,489
Were you blind, for not seeing me?

1229
01:49:53,620 --> 01:49:55,896
Not that! I can see the ghost!

1230
01:49:56,456 --> 01:49:59,699
My body is also weak, I saw the
ghost of Achu madam downstairs!

1231
01:49:59,793 --> 01:50:00,464
Come, I'll show you!

1232
01:50:00,560 --> 01:50:02,870
Why should I, there is no
acquaintance between us!

1233
01:50:02,996 --> 01:50:04,669
This is how you get to
know people, come!

1234
01:50:04,764 --> 01:50:06,243
Is this the way to come
in the middle of the night?

1235
01:50:06,299 --> 01:50:08,609
Didn't I tell you,
will come on Fridays?

1236
01:50:08,668 --> 01:50:11,945
My God, it is all preplanned
coming! Look, there is no head!

1237
01:50:12,205 --> 01:50:15,743
My God! My body is also
weak, I can also see now!

1238
01:50:15,809 --> 01:50:18,722
Go upstairs, there is Chinnu,Annu
and Banumathy Amma and all!

1239
01:50:18,812 --> 01:50:20,314
My God, is coming straight here!

1240
01:50:20,380 --> 01:50:21,916
Here, climbing the stairs!
Here it comes!

1241
01:50:23,316 --> 01:50:25,455
Move back you oldy!

1242
01:50:25,552 --> 01:50:26,496
Let me open this, cant!

1243
01:50:43,403 --> 01:50:45,906
Hey Mani, why is that,
there is screaming?

1244
01:50:46,106 --> 01:50:48,643
That is because we say
a dream and screamed!

1245
01:50:48,708 --> 01:50:51,416
You and Banumathy Amma, lying
together and seeing dreams!

1246
01:50:51,478 --> 01:50:53,822
Not like that, in the
dream, Jo madam...

1247
01:50:53,980 --> 01:50:55,516
Go and take the
luggage from the vehicle.

1248
01:50:55,582 --> 01:50:56,151
Come!

1249
01:51:01,554 --> 01:51:04,160
So the Bose sir has
got two wives, does he?

1250
01:51:04,491 --> 01:51:09,133
I tell you in detail later, come you
oldy! The right time to en quire!

1251
01:51:10,063 --> 01:51:12,065
This is what, in these
times, must not do any help,

1252
01:51:12,132 --> 01:51:14,339
to anybody that is
what the saying is.

1253
01:51:14,834 --> 01:51:17,713
Now look, all the
three came for stay!

1254
01:51:20,473 --> 01:51:23,920
If these women starts ...doing
like this what will we males do!

1255
01:51:24,878 --> 01:51:29,054
My poor Fatherl, may be like this,
he married three! At that time,

1256
01:51:29,182 --> 01:51:31,219
My Father would have
been mad like this is it not?

1257
01:51:31,317 --> 01:51:33,456
Your FathermSexually mad!

1258
01:51:33,553 --> 01:51:37,057
Are you comparing me to that
salacious Father of yours! Get lost!

1259
01:51:37,190 --> 01:51:41,536
Not of, no reason, simply draged
my Father in to this,

1260
01:51:41,628 --> 01:51:43,301
giving bad name to him
Father sorry! Forgive me!

1261
01:51:46,566 --> 01:51:49,843
All his Father and Mother is out at
large giving,no peace of mind to others!

1262
01:52:18,331 --> 01:52:20,538
As he has got some
contempt toward suicide!

1263
01:52:20,633 --> 01:52:23,477
Othenlvise, Bose would have
jumped in the pyre of his wife!

1264
01:52:26,072 --> 01:52:27,813
What is this, meditation!

1265
01:52:32,245 --> 01:52:34,555
Looks like these,
will hook Bose sir for sure!

1266
01:52:34,681 --> 01:52:37,218
When I went with
the tea to Bose sir,

1267
01:52:37,350 --> 01:52:39,227
he says as he had
not brushed his teeth,

1268
01:52:39,352 --> 01:52:40,990
No need of tea, arrack
(Spirit) would be better!

1269
01:52:41,488 --> 01:52:45,937
Today there would be some decision
on the drinking habit of Bose sir!

1270
01:52:49,562 --> 01:52:50,768
Don't beat me!

1271
01:52:53,767 --> 01:52:55,212
Save me!

1272
01:52:55,869 --> 01:52:56,643
Don't run!

1273
01:53:01,074 --> 01:53:04,317
Are you playing with my life?

1274
01:53:04,644 --> 01:53:06,521
Bose what is the issue?

1275
01:53:06,579 --> 01:53:11,927
See, you look at them alllYou also
see his face, this is his last moments!

1276
01:53:13,753 --> 01:53:17,030
The bottles, that I
have stocked in here,

1277
01:53:17,123 --> 01:53:19,899
who else other than you
have emptied everything?

1278
01:53:21,528 --> 01:53:24,236
Who had emptied everything?
Are you asking me?

1279
01:53:27,433 --> 01:53:30,437
My Lord! If I was the one who
emptied everything in a single night.

1280
01:53:30,537 --> 01:53:31,641
I would have been finished is it not?

1281
01:53:31,771 --> 01:53:34,047
Someone has intentionally
poured everything in the toilet!

1282
01:53:34,207 --> 01:53:35,049
Toilet!

1283
01:53:35,108 --> 01:53:36,451
Yes to avoid the bad smell!

1284
01:53:36,509 --> 01:53:38,785
To avoid the smell, one
should pour phenol,doesn't it?

1285
01:53:38,845 --> 01:53:41,553
No, not the smell of the toilet, to
avoid the smell of the whisk y!

1286
01:53:41,648 --> 01:53:43,150
If it, was poured in the
courtyard or on the grass,

1287
01:53:43,249 --> 01:53:44,057
the smell will come, will it not?

1288
01:53:44,150 --> 01:53:46,027
You sinner! If you
wanted to pour that away,

1289
01:53:46,119 --> 01:53:48,531
should have poured in my mouth!

1290
01:53:48,688 --> 01:53:51,225
To scold me like this, I'm
not the one who is staying here,

1291
01:53:51,357 --> 01:53:52,165
there are other people
also, staying here.

1292
01:53:52,225 --> 01:53:53,795
Who else? Here!

1293
01:54:01,868 --> 01:54:04,314
Without leaving
behind one single small!

1294
01:54:04,437 --> 01:54:07,577
That too, today's date is 1st!
Won't get a tiny drop to purchase!

1295
01:54:07,707 --> 01:54:10,051
Not me, that is the
order of the government!

1296
01:54:12,278 --> 01:54:21,460
I'm a gentleman otherwise...
This how all the ladies are!

1297
01:54:23,056 --> 01:54:24,831
Sorry,date is 1st!

1298

entrance of consciousness?"

1304

"You come with curls un knotted,
come as dissolved in the shadow."

1305
01:55:49,742 --> 01:55:58,457
"Part not, wait, time.
Come along and join love."

"How much should
one drink, wind?"

01:58:30,570 --> 01:58:33,107
"As the consciousness
fades in the day."

1324
01:58:33,206 --> 01:58:35,413
"where is the night lantern at
the entrance of consciousness?"

1325
01:58:35,808 --> 01:58:40,848
"You come with curls un knotted,
come as dissolved in the shadow."

1326
01:58:40,980 --> 01:58:45,793
"Part not, wait, time."

1327
01:58:45,918 --> 01:58:50,833
"Come along and join love."

1328
01:59:12,478 --> 01:59:17,478
<i>$11224.</i>

1329
02:00:08,100 --> 02:00:11,411
Honestly I didn't do anything!
I didn't know it was Anu.

1330
02:00:21,747 --> 02:00:22,817
Truly!
Get lost you!

1331
02:00:45,037 --> 02:00:48,018
Chinnu come, I'll
drop you at the office.

1332
02:00:52,044 --> 02:00:53,114
Hey Mani!

1333
02:00:56,349 --> 02:00:57,555
I'm coming now!

1334
02:01:05,524 --> 02:01:07,299
What, are you looking,
if anybody have seen?

1335
02:01:07,693 --> 02:01:10,697
Only in saying gentleman
in action, full of tricks.

1336
02:01:11,030 --> 02:01:13,601
It was an a mistake
that happened Anu.

1337
02:01:14,500 --> 02:01:17,777
I cannot pardon this.
I didn't know it was Anu.

1338
02:01:19,805 --> 02:01:23,343
If I knew it was me, how much it
would have made me happy.

1339
02:01:24,277 --> 02:01:27,349
You caught me and kissed me,
thinking that I'm someone else.

1340
02:01:27,680 --> 02:01:29,819
Anu don't talk to me like this.

1341
02:01:33,019 --> 02:01:35,363
Are you not a gentle man, or
have you given up that?

1342
02:01:35,721 --> 02:01:37,962
We must not talk like this.

1343
02:01:39,358 --> 02:01:45,798
Look Bose, they are all coming they
should not know we are like this, okay.

1344
02:01:49,368 --> 02:01:56,752
Come all of you get in, we will go
after dropping each one on the way.

1345
02:01:56,842 --> 02:01:58,651
What is this, is it a route
bus, to pick up everyone?

1346
02:01:58,711 --> 02:01:59,781
Then call that
Banumathy Amma also!

1347
02:02:00,246 --> 02:02:01,224
Hey you take the vehicle!

1348
02:02:07,420 --> 02:02:08,455
Get in, is everyone inside?

1349
02:02:29,608 --> 02:02:31,815
Mani after dropping
the Bose are you free?

1350
02:02:31,877 --> 02:02:34,255
Can, you come to pick me up in the
evening? Got some shopping for me.

1351
02:02:35,881 --> 02:02:40,626
For Bose, no need of vehicle till the
bar gets closed. We'll return before that.

1352
02:02:43,522 --> 02:02:44,557
Is it not okay?

1353
02:02:45,191 --> 02:02:46,033
Yes, very much okay!

1354
02:02:53,966 --> 02:02:55,138
Why, a sly smile?

1355
02:02:55,234 --> 02:02:58,374
Since we dropped madam,
it became a sly smile!

1356
02:02:58,437 --> 02:02:59,381
What can I do no that?

1357
02:02:59,472 --> 02:03:01,247
Did it create feeling for Boss?

1358
02:03:01,340 --> 02:03:02,341
If so we will drop her back.

1359
02:03:02,575 --> 02:03:03,610
You take the vehicle.

1360
02:03:12,084 --> 02:03:12,755
Greetings.

1361
02:03:15,821 --> 02:03:18,495
When Domenic told me, that
An nop is interested to take up

1362
02:03:18,557 --> 02:03:20,662
my Info solutions,which is closed,

1363
02:03:20,760 --> 02:03:22,535
I couldn't believe.

1364
02:03:22,595 --> 02:03:26,839
Menon sir, Anoop sir is now going to
tell something which is of greater joy.

1365
02:03:28,634 --> 02:03:33,674
I decided to take up Info Solution,
of no other reason, on seeing Anu.

1366
02:03:33,773 --> 02:03:35,980
Anu was the one who
was managing it.

1367
02:03:36,108 --> 02:03:39,920
IfAsten is also undertaken, I'm
going to hand over it to Anu.

1368
02:03:40,479 --> 02:03:45,155
<i>Not as a subordinate,
but as a partner cf Asks“.</i>

1369
02:03:53,659 --> 02:03:58,039
I came directly to ask,
will you marry me to Anu?

1370
02:03:59,965 --> 02:04:02,707
I still cannot conceive
whatAnnop has told.

1371
02:04:02,802 --> 02:04:04,440
Just like as if I've
seen a good dream.

1372
02:04:04,603 --> 02:04:08,449
I too was in this dream for
some time .Now only I'm re leaved.

1373
02:04:08,674 --> 02:04:13,646
But I'm not re leaved, I fear Anu
may not consent for this marriage.

1374
02:04:15,080 --> 02:04:18,960
Sir, you leave that to me I
will make Anu, consent to it.

1375
02:04:22,755 --> 02:04:24,860
Yesterday, I had a
meeting with Anu's Father.

1376
02:04:27,092 --> 02:04:28,298
Are you not asking what was it for?

1377
02:04:28,627 --> 02:04:30,163
If it were a matter
that I must be informed,

1378
02:04:30,229 --> 02:04:31,640
then without asking
you will say, is it not?

1379
02:04:33,966 --> 02:04:38,108
I need your consent also.
Come we will sit at the cafeteria.

1380
02:04:40,473 --> 02:04:43,920
Anu's Father's Info Solution is
going to be taken over by Asten.

1381
02:04:43,976 --> 02:04:45,477
What is Anu's opinion?

1382
02:04:45,478 --> 02:04:48,049
That is a company
which is black listed.

1383
02:04:48,981 --> 02:04:51,222
That is a foul play by our Sharath.

1384
02:04:52,117 --> 02:04:53,755
Is Asten also involved in that?

1385
02:04:54,954 --> 02:04:56,956
That is why I decided
to take up that.

1386
02:04:57,189 --> 02:05:00,170
We will redeem the
good will of Info Solutions.

1387
02:05:03,362 --> 02:05:05,968
On tomorrows meeting
with Father, Anu must also come.

1388
02:05:08,167 --> 02:05:09,202
I won't come.

1389
02:05:11,871 --> 02:05:14,818
My Father is now in a failed
position and me succeeded.

1390
02:05:15,207 --> 02:05:17,813
In a situation like this, it is
not fair that I meet Father now.

1391
02:05:47,106 --> 02:05:50,019
Why is that you are pouring out
everything, have you stopped drinking?

1392
02:05:50,776 --> 02:05:52,119
No I've not stopped it.

1393
02:05:54,280 --> 02:05:57,227
When you three ladies
are here, it is not fair that I drink.

1394
02:05:57,283 --> 02:05:59,024
For that reason why
do you want to pour it out?

1395
02:05:59,351 --> 02:06:00,557
It is better that you do not drink.

1396
02:06:01,320 --> 02:06:04,426
If it is here, that will
create tem ptation for me.

1397
02:06:04,523 --> 02:06:09,097
Like on the other day,
I may not become a gentle man.

1398
02:06:09,328 --> 02:06:10,500
Not only alcohol...

1399
02:06:10,596 --> 02:06:13,577
do you fear that we ladies
will also become a temptation"

1400
02:06:13,699 --> 02:06:15,303
That you are trying
to flee us from here?

1401
02:06:19,905 --> 02:06:21,043
As long as she is here!

1402
02:06:24,476 --> 02:06:26,717
Bose I need to
discuss an office matter.

1403
02:06:27,079 --> 02:06:30,856
I doubt I'm
misleading our MD Anoop.

1404
02:06:31,016 --> 02:06:34,759
It seems he is more
than above, interested in me.

1405
02:06:35,354 --> 02:06:35,991
Is that so?

1406
02:06:36,322 --> 02:06:40,065
He is going to undertake my
Father's closed down company,

1407
02:06:40,125 --> 02:06:44,096
Today Anoop, called me.
to discuss with the Father.

1408
02:06:44,597 --> 02:06:45,905
I turned it down!

1409
02:06:47,933 --> 02:06:51,380
Bose,it is not right to go and meet
Father in a situation like this.

1410
02:06:52,371 --> 02:06:54,647
If Father has a more
adverse situation than this,

1411
02:06:54,740 --> 02:06:57,778
if he comes here
to see the daughter?

1412
02:06:58,444 --> 02:07:00,185
That too, requesting for help?

1413
02:07:04,183 --> 02:07:07,653
Before letting Father to
end up in a disaster like that,

1414
02:07:07,720 --> 02:07:09,393
<i>Anu must go there and
meet Menu“ sir there.</i>

1415
02:07:21,567 --> 02:07:23,706
Life is also to make corrections!

1416
02:07:36,548 --> 02:07:38,721
Father might never
except, thatAnu would come.

1417
02:07:38,851 --> 02:07:43,266
Similarly my proposal to take up your
company,and Anu saying okay to it.

1418
02:07:43,922 --> 02:07:47,369
This is the greatest happiness,
you can give to Father.

1419
02:08:13,886 --> 02:08:15,422
I've given a lot of grief to my Father.

1420
02:08:21,093 --> 02:08:24,836
I should have never done like
that, to Sharth, at those times.

1421
02:08:26,598 --> 02:08:29,545
My Father should not
worry thinking all that.

1422
02:08:29,668 --> 02:08:32,080
All our problems
are going to be solved.

1423
02:08:32,204 --> 02:08:34,115
Through Anoop's proposal.

1424
02:08:34,339 --> 02:08:37,218
Menon sir, feared
whether Anu would agree to it.

1425
02:08:37,309 --> 02:08:39,289
Sir now you got relief, is it not?

1426
02:08:42,781 --> 02:08:44,522
For giving back my daughter!

1427
02:08:44,616 --> 02:08:48,029
Sir, I have not forced to bring
her, she came at her own will.

1428
02:08:49,088 --> 02:08:50,192
Daughter I'm so happy.

1429
02:08:50,289 --> 02:08:53,736
I got an urgent meeting,
came on the way.

1430
02:09:02,801 --> 02:09:04,178
Next time when you meet Sharath,

1431
02:09:04,236 --> 02:09:05,874
you must tell him sorry
to him, on my behalf.

1432
02:09:07,840 --> 02:09:08,614
I'll tell.

1433
02:09:27,993 --> 02:09:31,634
Sharath leave, this is Sony
Chayyan's partner, Moithunnuy!

1434
02:09:31,730 --> 02:09:33,869
If he is anybodies 'Unni'(child) what
has he got to do in my cabin?

1435
02:09:39,838 --> 02:09:40,748
Come here you!

1436
02:09:41,940 --> 02:09:44,614
Sharath, what the
hell are you doing?

1437
02:09:45,277 --> 02:09:48,053
Now this company is
not ours, it is this Moithunnuy's.

1438
02:09:48,180 --> 02:09:49,818
I have sold it to him!

1439
02:09:50,983 --> 02:09:53,088
The sole proprietorship
of this company was written...

1440
02:09:53,185 --> 02:09:55,131
in my name and now
you have sold it!

1441
02:09:55,254 --> 02:09:57,996
My Lord, what is he saying Vinod?

1442
02:09:58,157 --> 02:10:01,070
The money invested by him
including the interest was paid back.

1443
02:10:01,126 --> 02:10:03,003
Has he not given the
company back to us in writing?

1444
02:10:04,029 --> 02:10:06,737
That day he had
signed and given to us.

1445
02:10:06,932 --> 02:10:09,105
Hey Vinod read that
out! Let him hear.

1446
02:10:51,743 --> 02:10:54,724
He is taking my life!
Vinod catch him!

1447
02:10:56,682 --> 02:11:02,792
My Mother my spine! It is better
that this, that the Bose drinks!

1448
02:11:03,488 --> 02:11:04,262
What are you blabbering?

1449
02:11:04,756 --> 02:11:07,862
How long is it now? It
is almost going to be dusk.

1450
02:11:11,196 --> 02:11:13,870
Why can't you do it,
the old men are doing it.

1451
02:11:14,433 --> 02:11:19,405
These men are retired, no
otherjob to do, are we like that?

1452
02:11:19,471 --> 02:11:22,173
Look, if you continue like this
with in a week, we'll reach like that!

1453
02:11:22,174 --> 02:11:23,118
Not we, you!

1454
02:11:28,180 --> 02:11:29,250
So, has he started jogging?

1455
02:11:32,684 --> 02:11:34,925
What kind of a running is this?
Catch him!

1456
02:12:16,895 --> 02:12:19,398
Bose do you know
what a cheating, he did to us?

1457
02:12:19,498 --> 02:12:20,977
He had given back
everything to us in writing.

1458
02:12:21,066 --> 02:12:23,273
Now he had fled
with that agreement!

1459
02:12:23,702 --> 02:12:25,113
Bose, he is the one who cheated,

1460
02:12:25,203 --> 02:12:26,841
in the agreement he
had written everything to me,

1461
02:12:26,939 --> 02:12:28,714
But at the time of
signing he had changed that.

1462
02:12:29,908 --> 02:12:31,444
Now I understood everything.

1463
02:12:34,880 --> 02:12:37,622
There is no use if you keep,
it at hand or destroy it.

1464
02:12:37,749 --> 02:12:41,390
It is a parasitical kind of birth! If you
come to meet this kind of men.

1465
02:12:41,520 --> 02:12:46,265
He will go with a piece of our life!if
you don't give this to him now,

1466
02:12:46,325 --> 02:12:48,669
He'll torture you through out your life.

1467
02:12:49,127 --> 02:12:52,597
Or else we will have to kill him,
but we do not have time for that!

1468
02:12:52,664 --> 02:12:55,668
If you give this to him now, he will
go in search of some other prey!

1469
02:12:56,201 --> 02:13:00,240
Give to him, first you give him
one, after that give it to him!

1470
02:13:03,442 --> 02:13:05,149
You can beat me
how much you want

1471
02:13:05,243 --> 02:13:08,349
but I don't remember,
that I told you like that.

1472
02:13:08,880 --> 02:13:11,884
Enough of your drama,
if I see you again,

1473
02:13:11,984 --> 02:13:13,327
I will immerse you
in this back water!

1474
02:13:13,418 --> 02:13:14,556
Collect this and go!

1475
02:13:22,561 --> 02:13:24,438
You don't worry
anything on this just think,

1476
02:13:24,963 --> 02:13:29,343
it is the punishment
for meeting that filthy person!

1477
02:13:31,903 --> 02:13:36,477
Why do you want to worry?
Your time is just going to begin.

1478
02:13:58,363 --> 02:14:00,274
That is because of sleepyheads!

1479
02:14:11,276 --> 02:14:16,749
Have slept, will
start from the top.

1480
02:14:19,584 --> 02:14:20,562
Take this!

1481
02:14:24,923 --> 02:14:25,765
Come here!

1482
02:14:37,702 --> 02:14:38,680
Slowly!

1483
02:15:40,465 --> 02:15:41,808
Give this in the hand!

1484
02:15:43,401 --> 02:15:44,471
Scratch him!Slowly!

1485
02:16:04,556 --> 02:16:05,466
Keep it there!

1486
02:17:30,342 --> 02:17:31,150
What is this?

1487
02:17:31,876 --> 02:17:34,914
How Bose's birthdays are
celebrated when Achu was there,

1488
02:17:34,980 --> 02:17:36,516
From now on it has
to be celebrated like that.

1489
02:17:36,948 --> 02:17:38,757
Why is this kind of blasting?

1490
02:17:39,284 --> 02:17:42,663
For me, not only this day,
everyday is a celebration.

1491
02:17:42,887 --> 02:17:45,595
It is not like that. Bose, is born
for us what all happiness

1492
02:17:45,690 --> 02:17:48,603
we have experienced in our life,

1493
02:17:48,660 --> 02:17:49,968
It was given by Bose.

1494
02:18:11,549 --> 02:18:17,295
Today these ladies are going to
conquer kitchen, today's feast is by us!

1495
02:18:24,429 --> 02:18:25,999
Why man a deep breath!

1496
02:18:27,232 --> 02:18:29,576
There are certain things
in the time of birth is it not?

1497
02:18:29,901 --> 02:18:32,279
What is there?My Father's
birthday is also on today!

1498
02:18:34,973 --> 02:18:36,975
Who? That man who married three!

1499
02:18:38,043 --> 02:18:39,545
Can't my Father be born!

1500
02:18:40,145 --> 02:18:41,681
I'll change my birth day!

1501
02:18:41,780 --> 02:18:43,191
No need I'll change my Father!

1502
02:18:59,497 --> 02:19:03,343
Don't waste your time, roaming
here go there and sit idle, go.

1503
02:19:03,601 --> 02:19:06,804
I've brought a gift for three of you!

1504
02:19:06,805 --> 02:19:07,579
A sin?

1505
02:19:14,279 --> 02:19:15,314
Three of you come!

1506
02:19:17,549 --> 02:19:20,291
Before giving the
gift. A small question.

1507
02:19:21,186 --> 02:19:28,070
Three of you, whom do
you hate, the most?

1508
02:19:32,163 --> 02:19:34,268
Why so reluctance
in saying, is it me?

1509
02:19:34,499 --> 02:19:35,500
No.

1510
02:19:35,633 --> 02:19:38,273
We love Bose the most.

1511
02:19:40,939 --> 02:19:42,213
Me? Lie!

1512
02:19:42,474 --> 02:19:45,275
That is because Bose
doesn't like us that is why.

1513
02:19:45,276 --> 02:19:46,949
Who told you, I don't like you?

1514
02:19:47,078 --> 02:19:49,957
Who else knows, you
love the Achu the most?

1515
02:19:50,482 --> 02:19:52,985
Not to Achu also, you
know it from me!

1516
02:19:54,119 --> 02:19:54,995
Then?

1517
02:19:56,287 --> 02:20:04,365
I love, me the most!
Achu loves me to that extend...

1518
02:20:04,462 --> 02:20:06,464
that is why I love Achu!

1519
02:20:10,402 --> 02:20:16,284
Not only me we are all selfish in the
matter of love. This is not told by me.

1520
02:20:19,911 --> 02:20:23,051
When this selfishness is
between those who love,

1521
02:20:23,148 --> 02:20:25,958
there will be pain, feeling of offense.

1522
02:20:26,084 --> 02:20:27,529
And then they will part!

1523
02:20:29,854 --> 02:20:35,770
When it becomes a departing of no
return <i>,</i> then we become scattered!

1524
02:20:37,028 --> 02:20:38,871
Like my Achu!

1525
02:20:45,203 --> 02:20:48,047
There is no point,if I
long that Achu should return!

1526
02:20:48,173 --> 02:20:52,315
May be why the people who are
dead never like to come back!

1527
02:20:52,377 --> 02:20:57,122
Because the death is more
beautiful than love, who knows.

1528
02:20:57,482 --> 02:21:01,259
Or else those who
love, will return ! Here!

1529
02:21:24,442 --> 02:21:27,321
This is the Sharath,
whom all of you desired!

1530
02:21:51,870 --> 02:21:55,818
This what the saying is, the
one which we love intensely

1531
02:21:55,907 --> 02:21:57,215
will come in search of us.

1532
02:22:00,478 --> 02:22:03,516
I also began talking
like Bose is it not?

1533
02:22:03,948 --> 02:22:06,554
Bose has influenced
us to a great extent.

1534
02:22:11,990 --> 02:22:15,267
But in the case of Bose
you must fail and retreat!

1535
02:22:16,361 --> 02:22:19,342
You must be there in his life.

1536
02:22:19,831 --> 02:22:22,368
And expunge Achu from his mind!

1537
02:23:08,680 --> 02:23:09,920
Are you going at this time?

1538
02:23:11,149 --> 02:23:13,891
I'm always going, in this time, Annop
you are the one who is late today.

1539
02:23:14,018 --> 02:23:18,865
An u, there is a good news for you,
official announcement will follow.

1540
02:23:19,490 --> 02:23:20,798
I'm telling informally.

1541
02:23:26,764 --> 02:23:29,142
Next month both of
us together will have to go to US.

1542
02:23:34,806 --> 02:23:36,217
Why, are you not happy?

1543
02:23:41,579 --> 02:23:43,388
When should I give the resignation?

1544
02:23:47,952 --> 02:23:51,957
If you are going to send
me to US, I'll resign this job!

1545
02:24:03,434 --> 02:24:07,382
I love a person he will not
come anywhere, from here.

1546
02:24:07,505 --> 02:24:10,042
I'll also not leave him

1547
02:24:14,379 --> 02:24:15,517
Anu wait,

1548
02:24:18,282 --> 02:24:20,819
Anu you are
telling lies! To get rid of me.

1549
02:24:21,419 --> 02:24:22,591
Why should I get rid off Anoop?

1550
02:24:22,654 --> 02:24:25,658
From where, what are
you saying? I told my truth.

1551
02:24:26,057 --> 02:24:28,059
If there is a person
like that, then I must see him.

1552
02:24:28,159 --> 02:24:30,969
I should hear from
him what Anu says is true.

1553
02:24:31,095 --> 02:24:32,665
Otherwise I'll not
change my decision.

1554
02:24:41,039 --> 02:24:42,848
I had told aboutAnoop is it not?

1555
02:24:44,475 --> 02:24:48,252
What was in his mind,
now it has come out.

1556
02:24:49,380 --> 02:24:54,386
He wants to take me, to US
and a promotion for the name sake.

1557
02:24:57,922 --> 02:25:00,994
For that, he must take me, is it not?

1558
02:25:06,164 --> 02:25:08,542
Before, he proposing to me,

1559
02:25:08,633 --> 02:25:12,103
I headed straight and
told I'm in love with a person.

1560
02:25:13,004 --> 02:25:15,883
Why did you tell lies?
There is no person like that!

1561
02:25:16,808 --> 02:25:22,884
There is, that is Bose, that
you must come and tell to Anoop.

1562
02:25:22,980 --> 02:25:25,893
I'll not tell, how can I tell a
thing that is not there at all?

1563
02:25:26,684 --> 02:25:30,461
Then I'll resign the job that
I have mentioned to Anoop also!

1564
02:25:31,622 --> 02:25:35,627
Anu, you are so impulsive you
jump in to the things and decide.

1565
02:25:35,760 --> 02:25:37,433
Once you fought with your Father.
To help Sharath and then you...

1566
02:25:37,495 --> 02:25:40,601
went on cross with all of them.

1567
02:25:40,698 --> 02:25:43,872
Now resigning the job, for a matter
that is never going to happen.

1568
02:25:44,235 --> 02:25:46,442
You are only looking
at your own emotions

1569
02:25:46,571 --> 02:25:49,051
others have their
own right decisions.

1570
02:25:49,107 --> 02:25:52,145
There is no point in loving me, like
this <i>,</i> I must also feel like loving is it not?

1571
02:25:52,276 --> 02:25:53,653
Why you are not thinking?

1572
02:25:59,383 --> 02:26:03,854
I don't have any infatuation or love,
generally what a girl will have.

1573
02:26:03,955 --> 02:26:05,764
It is nothing like that
I feel towards you.

1574
02:26:09,694 --> 02:26:15,007
Those who identify a person like
this, they are lucky! Even then I lose you.

1575
02:26:17,735 --> 02:26:21,649
Then I will have to repend
on that, through out my life.

1576
02:26:24,742 --> 02:26:27,052
If Bose doesn't love me.

1577
02:26:27,779 --> 02:26:31,852
But I have love towards Bose that
you have to come and say that to him.

1578
02:26:32,250 --> 02:26:33,092
Or else.

1579
02:26:33,317 --> 02:26:37,732
He will think to neglect him,
I have intentionally told a lie.

1580
02:26:37,955 --> 02:26:39,525
That is not my practice.

1581
02:26:40,925 --> 02:26:45,931
Okay I'll come and say after saying
Anu must go to US, along with him.

1582
02:26:48,099 --> 02:26:53,674
If you can promise me like that I'll
come and say. Or else leave it.

1583
02:26:53,838 --> 02:26:55,078
Okay, agreed.

1584
02:26:56,908 --> 02:26:59,616
After Bose coming
and saying to Anoop and

1585
02:26:59,710 --> 02:27:04,819
ifAnoop insists me
going to US, I'll go.

1586
02:27:06,083 --> 02:27:08,495
After that his trouble
will be settled once and for all.

1587
02:27:08,653 --> 02:27:12,123
Then later, after sometime if the
Bose's mind get changed,

1588
02:27:12,223 --> 02:27:14,100
I'll wait till then.

1589
02:27:17,728 --> 02:27:22,734
Tomorrow I'll also come to
the office. Will meet him together.

1590
02:27:29,907 --> 02:27:31,944
Why is, child, Anu starting so early?

1591
02:27:32,043 --> 02:27:33,750
Is there any problem
with the Bose sir'?

1592
02:27:33,845 --> 02:27:35,620
May be out of fear there will be
some problem that might take place.

1593
02:27:35,680 --> 02:27:36,954
If any problem occurs
there is no point in going.

1594
02:27:37,081 --> 02:27:38,116
Then that will be a problem

1595
02:27:38,950 --> 02:27:43,160
Mani, where is Bose? He told
he will come with me to the office.

1596
02:27:43,287 --> 02:27:45,699
He left early in the morning,
told to pick him up after...

1597
02:27:45,756 --> 02:27:47,258
dropping madam at the office.

1598
02:27:47,792 --> 02:27:52,792
<i>$11224.</i>

1599
02:28:00,872 --> 02:28:04,046
Thought, not to mention to
the madam till reaching here,

1600
02:28:04,141 --> 02:28:07,350
but I can't make it,
without telling you.

1601
02:28:08,279 --> 02:28:11,385
For few days Bose has
stopped drinking, for that,

1602
02:28:11,482 --> 02:28:13,291
Anu madam is the reason.

1603
02:28:13,384 --> 02:28:16,524
But from today, morning, had
started again, that is because...

1604
02:28:16,587 --> 02:28:17,759
since madam is leaving.

1605
02:28:19,724 --> 02:28:22,432
So madam don't go
leaving behind Bose.

1606
02:28:22,526 --> 02:28:28,374
Mani I can't help without
going, I've promised to Bose.

1607
02:28:34,505 --> 02:28:38,317
Today Bose is drinking
not out of feelings.

1608
02:28:38,976 --> 02:28:40,512
He is celebrating my departure!

1609
02:28:48,920 --> 02:28:50,092
My God Bose!

1610
02:28:51,756 --> 02:28:55,397
Don't fall, what have you done?

1611
02:28:55,493 --> 02:28:57,996
I would have come there,
why coming in an auto?

1612
02:28:58,195 --> 02:29:00,835
Who are you to order that
I must not come in an auto?

1613
02:29:01,098 --> 02:29:04,409
MyAchu had gone in an
auto like this, lastly.

1614
02:29:04,502 --> 02:29:08,177
Sometimes, hoping to go, near
Achu', that is why I got in to this.

1615
02:29:08,239 --> 02:29:09,513
Who gave you license?

1616
02:29:10,174 --> 02:29:13,644
That day, that auto driver
landed Achu in a safe place.

1617
02:29:13,878 --> 02:29:16,518
But today, he
landed me in a danger.

1618
02:29:16,681 --> 02:29:18,354
Am 'I that danger'?

1619
02:29:21,953 --> 02:29:28,097
All of you listen, this
Anu loves me...But I

1620
02:29:28,592 --> 02:29:29,730
Do I not say that?

1621
02:29:29,961 --> 02:29:32,134
That is not the place to be told
here, but must be told at the top!

1622
02:29:32,196 --> 02:29:33,504
On top, to whom? To God.

1623
02:29:33,764 --> 02:29:34,970
To An hop!

1624
02:29:36,400 --> 02:29:39,244
Oh! Now on he is the
God man forAnu!

1625
02:29:41,739 --> 02:29:42,217
Don't fall!

1626
02:29:52,516 --> 02:29:57,932
Where is that person who
wants to see me? Go and tell him.

1627
02:30:00,024 --> 02:30:01,401
You only wait here!

1628
02:30:03,828 --> 02:30:04,966
Go and tell!

1629
02:30:06,931 --> 02:30:08,740
You only wait here!
I will only wait here.

1630
02:30:09,200 --> 02:30:11,146
If you come with me, I will change
your shape, battering you!

1631
02:30:11,268 --> 02:30:13,339
Don't fall it is full of glass!

1632
02:30:13,437 --> 02:30:15,110
That, I'll look into.

1633
02:30:16,207 --> 02:30:17,914
Bose this is the way.

1634
02:30:18,009 --> 02:30:19,044
Oh there!

1635
02:30:28,686 --> 02:30:31,895
Is it? where? Call him!

1636
02:30:54,245 --> 02:30:55,849
Sit here!

1637
02:30:58,849 --> 02:31:01,125
Anoop do you know Bose?

1638
02:31:01,218 --> 02:31:01,958
Do I know?

1639
02:31:03,821 --> 02:31:05,926
The person standing here,
is the owner of this company!

1640
02:31:08,059 --> 02:31:11,006
This com pany Asten international
belongs to Bose, An u.

1641
02:31:19,070 --> 02:31:22,108
This Anu is loving me,

1642
02:31:27,378 --> 02:31:31,849
That is what it seems.
So she desires that I must love Anu.

1643
02:31:32,116 --> 02:31:35,859
I was brought here, to tell
this to you, is that enough?

1644
02:31:36,520 --> 02:31:39,729
I've kept my word, now
Anu must keep your word.

1645
02:31:41,859 --> 02:31:47,935
Anoop, Anu will also come with
you to US, do the arrangements.

1646
02:32:02,546 --> 02:32:03,456
Anu wait.

1647
02:32:07,718 --> 02:32:10,198
Anu wait, let me say.

1648
02:32:14,792 --> 02:32:17,568
Anu, have promised me,
that you will go.

1649
02:32:17,661 --> 02:32:20,437
That was at that time,
now my decision is not to go.

1650
02:32:21,198 --> 02:32:24,668
Anoop, somehow you
must take her from here!

1651
02:32:24,768 --> 02:32:26,338
Nobody can take me like that!

1652
02:32:26,670 --> 02:32:28,877
Let me see, whether,
can betaken or not?

1653
02:32:29,807 --> 02:32:33,220
Anoop book me a ticket
also, I'm also coming!

1654
02:32:36,046 --> 02:32:40,654
From now on, with me,
there will be Anu also!

1655
02:33:03,774 --> 02:33:06,948
Have come not only to see you off,
but have come to say thanks.

1656
02:33:17,054 --> 02:33:22,663
I have spoke with Kununichettan,
we will come again for your marriage.

1657
02:33:25,062 --> 02:33:27,338
I've also applied for a passport.

1658
02:33:27,665 --> 02:33:28,939
Why? To go to America!

1659
02:33:29,033 --> 02:33:31,639
No, not for going but
for coming back!

1660
02:34:05,536 --> 02:34:08,244
Now in life there is
a good intoxication,

1661
02:34:08,305 --> 02:34:11,616
so I don't need the
support of this now!

1662
02:34:17,448 --> 02:34:21,658
Annop, this is Jo, Sharath's sister.

1663
02:34:22,519 --> 02:34:23,327
I know.

1664
02:34:25,856 --> 02:34:26,698
Poor 9W!

1665
02:34:32,763 --> 02:34:37,041
"On looking will appear the same.
But they are not similar."

1666
02:34:37,301 --> 02:34:41,647
"On this earth, everything
goes back to dust. "

1667
02:34:41,972 --> 02:34:44,073
"On looking will appear the same."

1668
02:34:44,074 --> 02:34:46,576
"But they are not similar."

1669
02:34:46,577 --> 02:34:51,083
"On this earth, everything
goes back to dust. "

1670
02:34:51,181 --> 02:35:00,192
"At day we labor,
at night will it spill off?"

1671
02:35:00,357 --> 02:35:04,703
"Never will the
flowery season return."

1672
02:35:04,962 --> 02:35:07,704
"Will again rapture a
season of golden Onam "

1673
02:35:07,765 --> 02:35:09,711
"( A festival of Kerala) with flowers."

1674
02:35:09,800 --> 02:35:14,249
"Do we have to hide
and cover with darkness?"

1675
02:35:14,338 --> 02:35:19,481
"Let the past be forgotten
and the new, be commenced."
