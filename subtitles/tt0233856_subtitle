00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:11,234
Lttle Brother-Dialogue List

2
00:01:16,309 --> 00:01:19,870
The cat likes fish and mice.

3
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:23,244
- That was really good!
- Gimme back my card!

4
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:24,645
Next...

5
00:01:24,784 --> 00:01:27,844
l won it fair!

6
00:01:27,987 --> 00:01:31,150
My mom told me to
get it back!

7
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:34,853
Teacher...

8
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,859
l have to go to the bathroom!

9
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:45,061
Hani.
That's what you said last time.

10
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:47,536
Then went to
the computer game room!

11
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:51,141
But l'm telling
the truth this time!

12
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:53,736
No!

13
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:01,952
Who will be next...
How about JiWoo?

14
00:02:02,088 --> 00:02:05,353
- The cat is reserved.
- lnteresting!

15
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:07,653
The cat is greedy.

16
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:13,254
- The cat is neat.
- Good. SoHee!

17
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:16,459
Then l'm betting with this card.

18
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:24,938
lf you lose and back out again.

19
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:27,945
So Yeon!

20
00:02:29,782 --> 00:02:34,242
- The cat is agile!
- Short, but good.

21
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:38,856
- DongHwa!
- My mother looks like a cat!

22
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:44,354
- DongJoo!
- The cat likes to steal.

23
00:02:45,798 --> 00:02:50,132
lnteresting.
JoonTae.

24
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:56,837
As the sun shines upon a napping cat.
Everything's peaceful.

25
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,402
PARK JoonTae

26
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:03,474
That was excellent!
Next...

27
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:06,045
JANG Hani!

28
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,657
The cat is a cat.

29
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:15,859
JANG Hani!
Don't kid around!

30
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:19,260
That's not proper composition.
Try again!

31
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,968
The cat is a kitty cat...

32
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:29,737
- Try again!
- The cat taking a nap...

33
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,346
is run over by a car.

34
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:39,344
Hey!

35
00:03:41,087 --> 00:03:43,146
End our second class.

36
00:03:48,494 --> 00:03:50,155
Who the hell is he?

37
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:06,041
- KlM HyungJoon, stop cutting in!
- Hey, it's your brother!

38
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,748
Can you walk, shitty pants?

39
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:19,656
lf you keep calling me
shitty pants, you're dead!

40
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:25,762
- Why are you going home?
- My head hurts.

41
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,567
Then we don't have to go to
the academy, right?

42
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:32,831
- Not right!
- Smart ass! My head hurts too!

43
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:35,632
You must mean your asshole!

44
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:40,144
lf you tell mom, you're dead!
l'm not kidding!

45
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:45,647
No academy means. We can watch
the 3 o'clock rerun for TV show.

46
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,844
Spread your legs.

47
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:50,148
You missed it
cause you were sleeping!

48
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:55,353
They showed a real funny parrot...
lt could talk and sing like this

49
00:04:56,195 --> 00:05:00,154
The school quack quack,
bell ding ding

50
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,326
- Ouch!
- Don't movie and stand!

51
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:09,967
Let's wash your clothes.
So mom will never know...

52
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:11,533
Okay!

53
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,344
Gosh, it's cold.

54
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:16,239
Hey! Stop it.

55
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:23,048
Gotcha!

56
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:32,923
Hey, that's shit water! Hey...
Hey, Stop it!!

57
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:44,334
Kick, Kick!
Get out of the way.

58
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:07,958
- Punch! Fist! Kick!
- Wake me when the alarm goes off.

59
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:21,944
Kick!

60
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:38,926
Punch, Punch
Punch, Punch!

61
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,465
Kick, Kick!

62
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:53,637
HanByul! HanByul!
Hurry, Mom's here!

63
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:58,547
- Get up!
- Did you skip the academy again!

64
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:02,843
l knew something smelled fishy.
l caught you this time!

65
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:04,785
HanByul said
he wasn't feeling well...

66
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:07,155
Get up! You're always
pretending to be sick!

67
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:08,658
Bring me my switch!

68
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:13,562
How many times has it been?

69
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:16,827
Didn't l give you
an earful last week?

70
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:20,301
You should be helping your
younger brother with his homework!

71
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:22,034
lnstead you're always skipping
academy classes!

72
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:25,838
The teacher's complaining that
Hani never does his homework!

73
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:28,742
Why are you making life
so difficult for me?

74
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:32,146
You should be more helpful
at such busy times!

75
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:35,044
l'm sorry, Mom.

76
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:36,849
Promise you'll do better?

77
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:41,353
Go to your room and
study your lessons.

78
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:45,362
JANG Hani!
Get your butt over here!

79
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:49,365
HanByul!
What's wrong!

80
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:52,733
Look at me!
HanByul, What's wrong?

81
00:07:54,373 --> 00:08:01,040
My body feels like rubber.
l can't get up.

82
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,546
l'm really sick, mom.

83
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:24,028
How many do you see
at the tip?

84
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:29,933
Two.

85
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,049
- We'll do a CAT Scan.
- Call the CAT Scanning Room.

86
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:15,518
Oops! Be careful.

87
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:21,551
- Patron for JANG HanByul!
- Yes.

88
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:22,956
Come in.

89
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:28,567
Take those shoes off!
Stop bothering your brother!

90
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:30,532
l told you to be careful!

91
00:09:32,271 --> 00:09:35,331
HanByul, sit over there.

92
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,752
Wanna hear about
the fart brothers?

93
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:04,532
Once upon a time, there lived two
fart monsters, HanByul and Hani.

94
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:13,840
HanByul's farts were so smelly,
and Hani's were so loud.

95
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:17,209
You could hear it
50,000m away...

96
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:23,444
This white mass is a tumor.

97
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:26,854
lt's already quite progressed.

98
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:32,157
The mass...
Do you mean cancer?

99
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:36,562
Yes, the correct term is
'brain tumor.'

100
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:40,901
His eyesight has become
severely limited.

101
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:44,436
We must remove the tumor
as soon as possible.

102
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:52,742
The fart brothers were walking
up a hill when villains jumped out!

103
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:55,183
The brothers quickly aimed
their asses

104
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:58,052
and fired fart bombs at them!
Bang, Bang Bang!

105
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,054
Then l'll go...

106
00:11:00,092 --> 00:11:01,957
Hey, that's gross...

107
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:03,254
lt's Dad!

108
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:06,565
- Hani!
- Dad!

109
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:11,734
Mommy smacked me and
said she would take my sneakers.

110
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:12,838
She did?

111
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:16,733
Are you done with
the examination?

112
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:17,710
Yes

113
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,371
Why so glum?

114
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:22,114
HanByul!
What's Dad's nickname?

115
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:23,206
Ha Ha Man!

116
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:25,078
Right! Ha Ha Man.

117
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:29,548
HanByul, give me a big smile.
Smile!

118
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:42,701
Your sleeves are so long
looks funny.

119
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:45,432
We can fold them up.

120
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:57,739
Mom, l'm sick, right?
lt's true, isn't it?

121
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:04,688
Yes, you are.

122
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:10,021
lt's true, HanByul!

123
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:17,233
l told you he was sick!
Didn't l?

124
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:23,537
You're such a dummy,
Mommy.

125
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,286
Hey~

126
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:54,339
Hani.

127
00:12:56,075 --> 00:13:00,444
Your brother's really sick.
You know that, right?

128
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:02,843
No!

129
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:14,087
l'm giving this
to your brother.

130
00:13:14,393 --> 00:13:20,059
Whenever you're mean to Hanbyul,
l'm having him write it down.

131
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:22,565
Your punishment
will be whippings.

132
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:24,629
Okay?

133
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:33,140
Here, HanByul.

134
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:10,547
Don't worry.
l'm glad we discovered it now.

135
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:13,251
What?

136
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:21,051
The surgery and chemotherapy
will make him well. And...

137
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:28,263
How can you say that?
You sound like a stranger!

138
00:14:29,301 --> 00:14:32,327
- Don't be upset.
- You're always like this.

139
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:35,929
Always playing around
with the kids

140
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:41,276
While l'm... snapping at him for
throwing up in the new car.

141
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,940
Whipping him for skipping
academy classes...

142
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:46,883
accusing him for lying ...

143
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:52,248
What did you do then?

144
00:14:57,496 --> 00:15:02,524
When our son was going blind,
What did you do?

145
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:11,443
What l am gonna do...

146
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,541
What l am gonna do...

147
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:33,763
Stop it!

148
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:37,628
l said, stop!

149
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:47,241
Thank you.

150
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:48,846
How's my boy?

151
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:52,744
Have this, and this.

152
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:56,645
My son.

153
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,450
Eat up.

154
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:03,553
l want you and my JoonTae
to be good friends.

155
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:05,459
This is dessert.
l made it myself.

156
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:09,661
- Ah, you mean Sebastian?
- Huh?

157
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:14,332
Hi, TaeWoong!

158
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:16,937
- Eat up!
- Yes, Ma'am.

159
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,044
Tadahh!

160
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:36,256
l'm fasting!

161
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:38,961
Fasting?

162
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:42,164
What's that?

163
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:48,135
- l can't eat anything.
- How come?

164
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:50,639
l have an operation tomorrow.

165
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:54,041
l can't eat anything before it.

166
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:57,546
Operation?
They're gonna do...

167
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:04,254
- this to your belly?
- Not my belly but up here.

168
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:07,291
l've got a bad bump
inside my head.

169
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,453
They're opening my head up,
and cutting it out.

170
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:17,334
Shit!

171
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:20,672
You are dead!

172
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:22,537
Hani, you've found your way
here by yourself!

173
00:17:22,674 --> 00:17:25,643
l am not stupid! l just had to get
on the shuttle bus...

174
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:31,647
What's that?

175
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:49,156
Dad! lt looks real funny.

176
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:54,131
Just shave it all off.

177
00:17:56,675 --> 00:17:57,835
Are you sure?

178
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:01,343
Everything?

179
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:05,948
l am doing it.

180
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:10,849
l'm doing it for real!

181
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:00,933
Mom.

182
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:03,103
Huh?

183
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:06,137
Are you staying for
the operation?

184
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:08,437
Yes... From now on,

185
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:15,115
l don't have to go to work.
Mommy will be with you.

186
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:20,156
You'll take a long nap,
and the operation will be over.

187
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:25,857
Mom, l'm a little scared.

188
00:19:38,076 --> 00:19:40,340
You look like an alien.

189
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,351
- Be strong, son.
- Bye!

190
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:55,460
Shitty pants.

191
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:30,757
HanByul, can you hear me?
Look at your mommy.

192
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:31,863
What's his night reflection?

193
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:33,862
- Prompt, sir.
- Huh.

194
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,134
- His vital signs?
- Positive, sir.

195
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:40,336
HanByul! HanByul!
lt's mommy. Can you see me?

196
00:20:40,472 --> 00:20:42,235
Who's this?

197
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:45,034
Who is it?

198
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:49,037
Shitty pants!

199
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:52,411
Scaredy cat!

200
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:55,544
- Good job! HanByul!
- Thank you.

201
00:20:55,687 --> 00:21:00,647
The doctor says your operation
went well. Don't worry.

202
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:02,657
l'm so proud of you.
Good boy.

203
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:05,963
- You did good.
- Scaredy cat!

204
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:39,428
Don't catch a cold.
And always keep yourself clean.

205
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,434
Or else you won't be allowed
to play with your brother.

206
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:49,033
- Okay?
- You shouldn't use HanByul's towel.

207
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:53,535
HanByul, l'm applying an antiseptic
solution. lt'll feel a bit cold.

208
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,045
Just bear with me, okay?

209
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,548
Which book are you reading
these days?

210
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:00,511
You seem to focus
on reading.

211
00:22:02,287 --> 00:22:06,155
HanByul, she's asking
what book you're reading.

212
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:13,665
He's reading 'Harry Potter.'
He's read it before...

213
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,928
You must be thrilled to be
leaving the hospital.

214
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:20,504
What are you planning
for summer vacation?

215
00:22:20,572 --> 00:22:21,937
We're going to the mountains.

216
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:27,341
We're gonna swim
and sleep in tents.

217
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,947
Aren't we, HanByul?

218
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:35,951
When are we going to
the mountains?

219
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:40,957
HanByul, you should have
answered her question.

220
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:44,460
l have to collect bugs.
lt's my vacation assignment!

221
00:22:44,596 --> 00:22:47,963
She just wanted to
hear your voice...

222
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,330
You keep making me
answer for you!

223
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:53,199
How many times
it has been?

224
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:56,637
You answer her next time!
Why do l have to keep on...

225
00:22:58,276 --> 00:22:59,937
Who told you to speak for me!

226
00:23:03,081 --> 00:23:08,041
lt's hard enough to stand the pain...
Why do l have to answer her!

227
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,856
You don't understand.

228
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:46,557
Take that!

229
00:23:46,691 --> 00:23:48,852
Tadahh!

230
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:50,552
What's this?

231
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:53,755
Mom, how come the Kimbap
looks so funny?

232
00:23:53,899 --> 00:23:56,834
Ugly ones always taste better!

233
00:23:56,968 --> 00:24:00,028
- l want a normal lunchbox!
- Just eat this!

234
00:24:02,574 --> 00:24:04,838
There's no hope for cookies...

235
00:24:06,878 --> 00:24:10,439
When you get better,
promise we'll go fishing,

236
00:24:10,582 --> 00:24:17,249
visit the mountains,
and go swimming! Okay? Hey!

237
00:24:56,995 --> 00:25:00,863
l went to Busan.
l was there for ten nights!

238
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:03,060
Ten nights? You're lying!

239
00:25:03,201 --> 00:25:06,329
l went swimming everyday
at my grandmas!

240
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:10,437
lt hurts,
you're scrathing my skin.

241
00:25:10,575 --> 00:25:16,172
Sebastian's been to Disneyland.
How about you, Hani?

242
00:25:23,288 --> 00:25:24,949
Oh my God!

243
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:28,059
Hey, Sebastian!
Do you write your diary in English?

244
00:25:29,494 --> 00:25:31,860
You're in Korea!
Korea!

245
00:25:32,797 --> 00:25:36,062
My name's PARK JoonTae!
Don't' call me Sebastian.

246
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:39,136
And mind your own business!

247
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:43,640
That's cool.
Can't you be cool?

248
00:25:43,775 --> 00:25:45,333
What...

249
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:47,836
cool?

250
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:09,763
What're you looking at!
Want a taste of my fist?

251
00:26:14,973 --> 00:26:17,942
When you get well, you'll
be able to walk better, right?

252
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:21,443
Yeah, but my arms and legs
won't get better.

253
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,640
- How about your eyes?
- Even eyes!

254
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:29,652
- That's not getting better!
- l don't know. And stop pushing me!

255
00:26:51,676 --> 00:26:53,041
Mom...

256
00:27:47,232 --> 00:27:50,668
Lower the volume,
my ears are gonna burst!

257
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:54,327
Right.
lt's time for your medicine.

258
00:28:10,488 --> 00:28:15,551
Stop making so much noise!
My entire body's aching!

259
00:28:19,497 --> 00:28:22,955
Hani! Do you know how strong
your brother's medicine is!

260
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:25,433
You're driving me nuts!

261
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:29,939
You're big fat whiners!
l hate you both!

262
00:28:31,576 --> 00:28:34,739
Hani, open the door! Hani!

263
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:39,644
You know your brother's sick!

264
00:28:39,784 --> 00:28:43,242
Open the door, Hani!

265
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:15,853
- Shouldn't we give him Zofran?
- Hold on!

266
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,252
His fever's not dropping.
We should take him to ER.

267
00:29:21,392 --> 00:29:23,952
Okay. l'll get the car.

268
00:29:57,495 --> 00:30:00,259
By attacking it so much...

269
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:30,153
Hani.

270
00:30:31,296 --> 00:30:34,356
Dad...Dad...Dad...

271
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:37,434
Have you been here alone all night?

272
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:39,036
Were you scared?

273
00:30:40,271 --> 00:30:41,533
What?

274
00:30:43,474 --> 00:30:45,237
Don't cry...

275
00:30:45,376 --> 00:30:48,937
That's my fault...

276
00:30:50,481 --> 00:30:55,043
l used... the fish towel!

277
00:30:56,588 --> 00:30:58,852
Bad germs...

278
00:31:00,892 --> 00:31:02,860
got to HanByul...

279
00:31:06,397 --> 00:31:11,425
Don't worry.

280
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:13,737
lt's OK

281
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:58,143
Hi, Wook!

282
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:02,143
All this noise tells me that
Wook is here!

283
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:05,848
l'm not Wook!
My name's Little boy Jade!

284
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:08,458
Little boy Jade!

285
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:13,964
l never thought he would
get worse so soon...

286
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:19,331
l'm so proud of Wook. For 3yrs,
He's put up a strong fight.

287
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:21,734
lt's an incredible.

288
00:32:21,873 --> 00:32:25,741
We never had a child who has
smiled through such pain as he.

289
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,651
This is my place.

290
00:32:37,488 --> 00:32:38,750
Want some rice cakes?

291
00:32:41,492 --> 00:32:43,357
You're new here!

292
00:32:44,395 --> 00:32:46,363
JANG HanByul, 12 yrs old?

293
00:32:47,598 --> 00:32:51,625
You look smaller than me.
What's wrong with you?

294
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:56,036
- Nothing's wrong! Get out!
- l'm not inside?

295
00:32:56,674 --> 00:33:02,840
What a country boy...
Who looks girly and stinks...

296
00:33:04,182 --> 00:33:07,948
l don't want rice cakes!
lt stinks!

297
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:13,457
JANG Hani!
Take those clothes off!

298
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:27,060
- Are you HanByul?
- Yeah, JANG HanByul!

299
00:33:27,372 --> 00:33:31,433
- What's your name?
- My name is Choi Wook.

300
00:33:34,445 --> 00:33:38,438
You two look like brothers.

301
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:41,450
Wook, you now have an
older brother.

302
00:33:41,586 --> 00:33:43,952
You must be tired.
Let's get you in bed.

303
00:33:44,088 --> 00:33:45,953
- Excuse me.
- Uh, yes.

304
00:33:54,098 --> 00:33:54,655
Wook!

305
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:56,266
- Dad!
- Wook!

306
00:33:57,668 --> 00:33:59,602
lt's time for
'How in the world could this happen'.

307
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:01,160
You're the best, Dad!

308
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:04,535
Whoever wants to watch TV,
gather around!

309
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:13,749
l'm not tired.
l want to watch TV with Wook.

310
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:29,867
Come over, come over here.

311
00:34:30,168 --> 00:34:32,932
l've never ever seen
anything like that!

312
00:34:33,671 --> 00:34:38,734
lt's not only once in a blue moon.
He's sucking the milk any time.

313
00:34:38,876 --> 00:34:42,243
HanByul, have you seen the
Tarzan man who was on before?

314
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:45,315
Yeah.
Hani loves that guy.

315
00:34:45,383 --> 00:34:47,408
You mean the one who
swingsfrom place to place?

316
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:50,349
He lives in the mountains
behind our place.

317
00:34:51,189 --> 00:34:52,656
You liar!

318
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:54,849
l'm not kidding...

319
00:34:54,992 --> 00:34:58,951
You call everyone a big fat liar
cause you're one yourself!

320
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:06,532
Look at this!
lt's an autograph of Little Boy Jade.

321
00:35:08,172 --> 00:35:11,141
- Wow, how cool!
- Yeah.

322
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:18,743
You must be kidding?
An autograph should be authentic!

323
00:35:18,883 --> 00:35:20,908
l'll get a real one!

324
00:35:21,152 --> 00:35:24,644
When l get better,
l'm gonna go to his gag concert.

325
00:35:24,755 --> 00:35:28,623
My dream is becoming a comedian.
Like Little Boy Jade!

326
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:32,251
You're not funny!
You're scary!

327
00:35:57,488 --> 00:36:02,585
Hey, Wook! Look at Hani.
How he rides those wheels!

328
00:36:03,127 --> 00:36:05,357
Pretty good!

329
00:36:05,796 --> 00:36:10,859
Hani, let me ride them for once.
Hey! JANG Hani.

330
00:36:11,068 --> 00:36:18,304
Just once.
Just this once. Please, Hani!

331
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:20,742
Hani!
Let Wook ride them once.

332
00:36:20,878 --> 00:36:27,647
You can't, country boy...
Country boy, country boy...

333
00:36:27,785 --> 00:36:30,652
Didn't l tell you not to call
Wook a country boy!

334
00:36:31,789 --> 00:36:33,848
But he is one!

335
00:36:41,999 --> 00:36:43,626
Raise your right foot!

336
00:36:44,268 --> 00:36:45,929
Shut up!

337
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:47,435
You shut up!

338
00:36:48,773 --> 00:36:50,934
Put your left foot down!

339
00:36:51,576 --> 00:36:55,034
- l told you to shut up!
- No, you shut up!

340
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,725
Please wait outside.

341
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:10,448
Mom, my shit's too big!

342
00:39:04,475 --> 00:39:08,969
Who said you shouldn't cry
in front of your sick child?

343
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:14,149
Day after day, l have to cry
in this stinking place.

344
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:21,519
Try submerging your face
in the water.

345
00:39:22,593 --> 00:39:30,022
That way, your face won't get
swollen and eyes go bloodshot.

346
00:39:34,772 --> 00:39:37,536
Just try it!

347
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:48,409
Mom, my shit's sitting up
like a snake!

348
00:39:48,586 --> 00:39:51,953
Come quick, it's really big!

349
00:39:54,291 --> 00:39:56,953
You think she has nothing better
to do than stare at your shit?

350
00:39:57,094 --> 00:39:59,756
You're shit's stinking up
the entire hospital.

351
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:03,333
Who's that? Mom?
Who is she?

352
00:40:24,388 --> 00:40:26,049
Wook, you'll fall.

353
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:35,065
- Are you okay?
- Yes

354
00:40:43,974 --> 00:40:45,839
Hani, you're here!?

355
00:40:51,982 --> 00:40:54,246
l gave him my old one.

356
00:40:54,385 --> 00:40:59,550
- How come? He can't even ride them!
- Stop thinking l can't.

357
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:02,158
Are you kidding me!
You can't even walk in them!

358
00:41:03,594 --> 00:41:05,653
Why do you have this?!

359
00:41:06,197 --> 00:41:07,755
You gave it to me.

360
00:41:07,898 --> 00:41:10,628
lt's mine now.
Give it back to Wook!

361
00:41:10,768 --> 00:41:15,637
Hair grows on your asshole if
you take back what you gave.

362
00:41:16,674 --> 00:41:19,643
lt's mine! Give it back!
Give it to me!

363
00:41:19,777 --> 00:41:22,837
Give it back! Awe shit!

364
00:41:47,471 --> 00:41:50,440
That was really mean of you.

365
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,245
Wook!

366
00:42:01,085 --> 00:42:02,347
Wook!

367
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:20,999
Wook hasn't told anyone! Stop
being scary, and go apologize to him!

368
00:42:21,672 --> 00:42:24,300
l'm not scared!
You apologize!

369
00:42:25,976 --> 00:42:29,742
Hani, you did a mean thing.

370
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:33,748
Wook is sicker than l am!
You're not supposed to hit him!

371
00:42:36,787 --> 00:42:41,315
All your fault!
l gave you the King of Fun card,

372
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:45,328
cause you're sick.

373
00:42:45,763 --> 00:42:47,822
lt was my present to you.

374
00:42:48,699 --> 00:42:51,827
Why did you give it to
someone else? Why!

375
00:43:17,294 --> 00:43:19,660
Hey! stop him, JoonTae.

376
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,727
Shit!

377
00:43:34,678 --> 00:43:35,770
Hey, stop him!

378
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:41,347
Hey! stop him, JoonTae.
Shit!

379
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:55,060
- Hey, stop it!
- You wanna die!

380
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:56,063
Stop!

381
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:59,636
Stop! Stop!

382
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:07,536
- Let go.
- JANG Hani, stop!

383
00:44:07,678 --> 00:44:09,236
Stop!

384
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:13,043
Hani, you are dead!
He will tell on his Mom.

385
00:44:18,789 --> 00:44:21,849
Why can't you tell me who did this?
Are you being threatened?

386
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:24,756
l hurt myself playing soccer,
so just go!

387
00:44:24,895 --> 00:44:27,363
Then why are you refusing to
go to school!

388
00:44:27,464 --> 00:44:29,932
l am going to find out
who did this to you!

389
00:44:33,237 --> 00:44:34,898
You look real cool.

390
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:39,100
You must feel great going home, Wook.
What's with the long face!

391
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:43,841
Don't cry.
lt'll just drain you.

392
00:44:47,384 --> 00:44:48,442
Wook!

393
00:44:50,988 --> 00:44:55,652
l like staying here
with you better.

394
00:44:55,793 --> 00:44:59,251
l'm bored all day
when l'm home.

395
00:45:01,598 --> 00:45:04,123
l'll go see you when
l'm out of the hospital!

396
00:45:04,268 --> 00:45:07,362
Really?
When will you be out?

397
00:45:07,438 --> 00:45:09,633
When l'm finished
with my radiation therapy.

398
00:45:09,773 --> 00:45:13,038
Mom!
You'll let me visit Wook. Right?

399
00:45:14,278 --> 00:45:15,643
Really?

400
00:45:18,582 --> 00:45:21,244
Promise me, okay?

401
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:25,151
l got a new bicycle.
When you come visit, l'll let you ride it.

402
00:45:35,299 --> 00:45:38,029
l heard the news from
HanByul's teacher today.

403
00:45:38,168 --> 00:45:39,829
Yeah...

404
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:43,337
l would have paid more attention
to Hani if l had known earlier.

405
00:45:46,477 --> 00:45:50,243
Um... Hani...

406
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:52,940
didn't come to school today.

407
00:45:54,885 --> 00:45:58,252
He hasn't been getting along
with a classmate.

408
00:45:58,388 --> 00:46:02,449
Two days ago, he got hurt
during a fight with Hani.

409
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:07,053
The injured boy's mother made
a complaint to the principal.

410
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:13,534
l'm sure you have
enough on your mind,

411
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:16,230
but please talk to Hani.

412
00:46:21,879 --> 00:46:23,938
Hey, Little Boy Jade!

413
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:26,044
HanByul!

414
00:46:26,683 --> 00:46:30,744
For my medicine, l have to wait.
lt's my home phone number!

415
00:46:30,888 --> 00:46:32,253
l have a problem!

416
00:46:39,897 --> 00:46:42,559
- Why?
- JANG Hani...Where are you now?

417
00:46:42,699 --> 00:46:45,190
- JANG Hani!
- Wow!

418
00:46:47,171 --> 00:46:48,832
Dummies!

419
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:55,240
This is mouth wash.
Gargle and spit...

420
00:46:55,379 --> 00:46:58,746
- Just go to Wook's place.
- l won't!

421
00:47:00,184 --> 00:47:01,651
Not country boy's place!

422
00:47:01,785 --> 00:47:03,053
Suit yourself.

423
00:47:03,053 --> 00:47:06,853
Summer vacation starts, you've got
plenty of time to get punished!

424
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:10,858
Mom's in a horrible mood these days.
You're dead!

425
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:15,761
Yeah, she's real scary when she's mad!
What're you gonna do?

426
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:31,947
Bye, Wook!

427
00:47:33,083 --> 00:47:38,350
Bye, HanByul!
Bye, HanByul!

428
00:47:38,488 --> 00:47:40,456
Bye!

429
00:47:41,291 --> 00:47:43,657
Bye, HanByul!

430
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:47,261
Bye

431
00:48:35,345 --> 00:48:38,610
- should pick some ginko nuts
- ls it time to?

432
00:48:38,715 --> 00:48:40,114
For sure

433
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:42,878
We can pick
some tomorrow with kids.

434
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:46,780
Eat well, good boy!

435
00:48:57,768 --> 00:49:01,829
Our opponent, JANG Hani is
about to make his kimchi shoot!

436
00:49:01,972 --> 00:49:04,031
He's pacing the goal post like
a man taking a shit

437
00:49:04,174 --> 00:49:07,871
but letting out empty
farts instead!

438
00:49:08,979 --> 00:49:12,244
This time it's really a goal!

439
00:49:14,685 --> 00:49:19,054
That's against the rules!
No smacking the head with a spoon!

440
00:49:19,589 --> 00:49:22,649
The spoon's for
spooning up rice!

441
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:24,954
You're absolutely right!

442
00:49:57,728 --> 00:50:00,094
Hey, Wook!

443
00:50:08,872 --> 00:50:11,534
This?
l have them all over me.

444
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:13,836
Some here.

445
00:50:13,977 --> 00:50:15,535
And here...

446
00:50:18,482 --> 00:50:21,940
You wanna go see
Tarzan man?

447
00:51:28,485 --> 00:51:30,350
Dummy,
you don't even know the way!

448
00:51:34,191 --> 00:51:36,955
Uh, lt's a sunny-side-up
fried egg flower!

449
00:51:38,695 --> 00:51:40,356
Fried egg?

450
00:51:41,198 --> 00:51:44,326
HanByul and l call it
cause it looks like a fried egg!

451
00:51:45,268 --> 00:51:46,235
Look!

452
00:51:48,371 --> 00:51:51,829
This is the yolk.
And this is the egg white.

453
00:51:52,476 --> 00:51:54,774
lt's my favorite,
Erigeron Annuus.

454
00:51:54,845 --> 00:51:57,279
And you call it what?
Fried egg?

455
00:51:58,248 --> 00:51:59,909
Then eat it!

456
00:52:00,083 --> 00:52:01,345
Erigeron Annuus?

457
00:52:02,085 --> 00:52:06,044
That sounds funnier.
l'll call it erigeron ANAL!

458
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:49,256
- Hey...
- What?

459
00:53:05,482 --> 00:53:08,246
Hey, JANG Hani! Hani!

460
00:53:25,969 --> 00:53:27,129
Hani...

461
00:53:41,785 --> 00:53:42,843
Wook!

462
00:53:43,687 --> 00:53:46,952
Wook! Wook!

463
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:48,957
Wook!

464
00:53:50,694 --> 00:53:53,162
l hope they didn't go up
the mountain in the back!

465
00:53:53,296 --> 00:53:57,926
lt may look harmless,
but you can get lost there.

466
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:06,042
You're here!

467
00:54:06,776 --> 00:54:08,334
No news yet?

468
00:54:08,478 --> 00:54:11,140
lt looks like they
went up the mountain.

469
00:54:11,214 --> 00:54:11,908
What?

470
00:54:12,382 --> 00:54:13,440
Wook! Hey!

471
00:54:14,985 --> 00:54:15,952
Hey, CHOl Wook!

472
00:54:17,988 --> 00:54:19,148
Hey, Wook!

473
00:54:22,192 --> 00:54:25,059
Wake up!

474
00:54:58,595 --> 00:55:00,062
Wook...

475
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:18,943
Wook!

476
00:55:19,082 --> 00:55:20,640
JANG Hani!

477
00:55:20,784 --> 00:55:23,048
Where are you Wook?

478
00:55:23,186 --> 00:55:26,849
- Wook!
- CHOl Wook!

479
00:55:33,196 --> 00:55:37,826
Don't come near!
Go! Go away!

480
00:55:37,967 --> 00:55:41,733
Don't touch him! Gp away!
Don't touch him!

481
00:55:55,385 --> 00:55:58,354
Wook! Wook!

482
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:01,850
Wook! Are you OK?

483
00:56:04,794 --> 00:56:09,857
l'm not Wook.
My name's Little Boy Jade.

484
00:57:15,799 --> 00:57:16,925
Wook!

485
00:57:17,367 --> 00:57:18,334
Hani!

486
00:57:18,468 --> 00:57:23,030
- Mom! Dad!
- Dad!

487
00:57:23,173 --> 00:57:28,133
- Wook! Wook...
- Hani...

488
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:29,643
- Wook!
- Hani!

489
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:30,336
Wook!

490
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:33,142
- Hani, get your butt over here!
- Mom!

491
00:57:45,161 --> 00:57:47,891
Wook!
Did you go up the mountain?

492
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:48,726
Yes!

493
00:57:49,399 --> 00:57:51,731
- You really went up there?
- Yes.

494
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:55,528
My Wook's all better now!

495
00:58:13,756 --> 00:58:17,522
l'm telling the truth!
He really was dead!

496
00:58:17,694 --> 00:58:20,561
Be quiet. lf that water

497
00:58:20,697 --> 00:58:23,257
can raise the dead,

498
00:58:23,399 --> 00:58:26,027
there wouldn't be a single dead
person in the world!

499
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:28,797
Cause no one knows
about it!

500
00:58:29,272 --> 00:58:31,866
He really woke up
after drinking it!

501
00:58:31,975 --> 00:58:34,341
l'm sure he just fainted!

502
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:37,571
But, you could've got
him killed!

503
00:58:40,283 --> 00:58:43,548
That water would sell well
at this hospital, wouldn't it?

504
00:58:44,087 --> 00:58:45,645
Go to sleep!

505
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:57,356
Ouch! ln real life,
Tarzan man's so dirty.

506
00:59:04,073 --> 00:59:06,442
Hey, monkey, come down!

507
00:59:06,442 --> 00:59:09,138
You already broke one of
my jump ropes yesterday!

508
00:59:09,279 --> 00:59:13,739
Why can't he do it with his own!
l don't get him!

509
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:15,248
l know.

510
00:59:31,868 --> 00:59:36,931
What, Wook's back?
Okay. l'm coming, bye!

511
00:59:39,375 --> 00:59:41,138
Hey, your backpack!

512
00:59:52,689 --> 00:59:56,352
Don't wake him.
Let's come back later.

513
00:59:57,293 --> 01:00:01,059
Let's just wait here, huh?

514
01:00:01,197 --> 01:00:03,495
We don't know
when he'll wake up.

515
01:00:03,566 --> 01:00:06,558
We'll just ask them to call us
when he does.

516
01:00:07,170 --> 01:00:08,228
Let's go.

517
01:00:14,177 --> 01:00:16,338
lt's too dangerous to continue
chemotherapy on him.

518
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:21,648
He'll probably
never come out of his sleep.

519
01:00:30,893 --> 01:00:36,763
For the past 3 yrs l've worked so
hard to pay the hospital bills,

520
01:00:36,833 --> 01:00:40,428
that l've never enjoyed
a single day with him.

521
01:00:42,772 --> 01:00:47,641
He's put up a good fight for
the past 3 months.

522
01:00:49,779 --> 01:00:52,839
l can't give up the treatment now.

523
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:56,145
But you know
it'll be ineffective.

524
01:00:58,888 --> 01:01:02,483
His body cannot endure
the medication anymore.

525
01:01:05,695 --> 01:01:07,959
Be prepared for the worst.

526
01:01:14,971 --> 01:01:17,132
You're here to see Wook?

527
01:01:55,578 --> 01:01:59,742
Welcome. l'll take care of you.
Have a good time!

528
01:01:59,882 --> 01:02:05,149
l'll fix you up with cool dudes!

529
01:02:06,022 --> 01:02:10,049
Hey boy! Who are you with?

530
01:02:10,193 --> 01:02:12,753
Glad to see you girls!

You always give us a good deal!

532
01:02:16,766 --> 01:02:19,530
- Little Boy Jade...
- l've got to score my first customer!

533
01:02:19,669 --> 01:02:22,137
- What do you want? Hey!

534
01:02:22,271 --> 01:02:24,535
You're pissing me off!

535
01:02:24,674 --> 01:02:27,234
Girls, wait a second!
Wait a minute!

536
01:02:27,376 --> 01:02:28,035
Hey

537
01:02:28,978 --> 01:02:31,037
Go home! Little jerk!

538
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:35,618
Please l beg you...

539
01:02:35,618 --> 01:02:39,714
l need to meet
Little Boy Jade, please!

540
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:49,527
You really want to meet
Little Boy Jade?

541
01:02:51,367 --> 01:02:53,130
A lot?

542
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:59,834
Then go over to that parking lot
in the back.

543
01:03:01,377 --> 01:03:02,742
Go there.

544
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:10,349
My friend Wook,
he's really sick.

545
01:03:12,889 --> 01:03:17,792
He wants to be a
comedian like you.

546
01:03:20,396 --> 01:03:22,864
He wants to become a comedian.

547
01:03:24,767 --> 01:03:28,134
He really wants to meet you.

548
01:03:30,973 --> 01:03:34,238
He will get better
after meeting you.

549
01:04:01,103 --> 01:04:04,732
l have a friend called Wook...

550
01:04:45,181 --> 01:04:50,244
Little Boy Jade will be
here tonight!

551
01:05:44,073 --> 01:05:45,540
- You're here.
- Yeah.

552
01:05:48,077 --> 01:05:51,046
Hani, l'll take you home today.
You got wet in the rain yesterday.

553
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:54,843
You look like you have the flu.
You could give it to your brother.

554
01:05:55,584 --> 01:05:57,552
No!

555
01:05:57,987 --> 01:06:01,753
- Then, do you want to go with Daddy?
- l'm not going!

556
01:06:04,093 --> 01:06:08,962
- Why? Why not?
- l don't know...

557
01:06:16,472 --> 01:06:18,030
What's the matter?

558
01:06:31,087 --> 01:06:33,351
- Have you checked everything?
- Yes.

559
01:07:10,593 --> 01:07:13,357
He's...awake! He's awake!
He's awake!

560
01:07:13,496 --> 01:07:15,555
Please be quite...

561
01:07:36,185 --> 01:07:40,747
- You're Little Boy Jade!
- Hey! Quiet...

562
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:43,154
Little Boy Jade!

563
01:07:57,973 --> 01:08:02,034
Mom! Mom!

564
01:08:08,784 --> 01:08:11,617
No one as ugly as you deserves
to be so arrogant!

565
01:08:11,687 --> 01:08:14,850
You should at least be as
good looking as l am...

566
01:08:15,891 --> 01:08:19,054
My name is Little Boy Jade!

567
01:08:20,529 --> 01:08:25,057
Wow! Hi, my name's Yooki.
Please call me Yooki O-Cheon!

568
01:08:26,168 --> 01:08:30,036
l now appoint you, 'comedian.'

569
01:08:34,276 --> 01:08:36,836
Thanks, 'shitty pants!'

570
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:40,246
Now, let's have fun!

571
01:08:43,586 --> 01:08:46,453
My name is Little Boy Jade!

572
01:09:39,775 --> 01:09:42,437
- lsn't it cool?
- So cool!

573
01:09:42,578 --> 01:09:43,943
- Awesome, isn't it?
- Wow! ls it really Little Boy Jade?

574
01:09:44,046 --> 01:09:46,412
Did you get his autograph?

575
01:09:46,549 --> 01:09:49,916
- Terrific! Did you really see him?
- Of course l did.

576
01:09:51,987 --> 01:09:54,353
- Where's JoonTae?
- l don't know.

577
01:09:58,194 --> 01:09:59,559
He is Wook.

578
01:10:00,596 --> 01:10:03,429
There's no cure for cancer.

579
01:10:03,566 --> 01:10:08,026
Only medicine that makes your
hair fall out like HanByul's.

580
01:10:10,573 --> 01:10:13,337
My brother doesn't have cancer!
He has a brain tumor!

581
01:10:18,847 --> 01:10:22,874
Since his first operation, you can
see a noticeable change in size.

582
01:10:23,786 --> 01:10:26,254
Such rapid growth like
this rarely occurs.

583
01:10:27,990 --> 01:10:30,857
lt looks like the tumor has
become quite malignant.

584
01:10:32,494 --> 01:10:33,961
Although

585
01:10:34,797 --> 01:10:36,822
we may have to

586
01:10:37,566 --> 01:10:40,126
give up his optic nerves,

587
01:10:42,671 --> 01:10:45,333
we need to remove the entire
tumor to prevent a relapse.

588
01:11:46,869 --> 01:11:48,234
Hani.

589
01:11:48,971 --> 01:11:51,633
HanByul's getting another
operation tomorrow!.

590
01:11:51,774 --> 01:11:55,232
Let's wave our hands for him!
So he'll be strong!

591
01:11:55,377 --> 01:11:59,245
But he's already had one!
Why another?

592
01:12:00,082 --> 01:12:03,142
ls a brain tumor also cancer?

593
01:12:04,887 --> 01:12:06,252
ls he gonna die?

594
01:12:09,291 --> 01:12:15,252
Hani. Your brother's not gonna die!
He'll be okay.

595
01:12:19,668 --> 01:12:23,729
HanByul wants to see Hani.

596
01:12:30,879 --> 01:12:32,141
Hi.

597
01:12:34,083 --> 01:12:36,142
Hi.

598
01:12:39,388 --> 01:12:44,655
l told them
l only wanted to see Hani.

599
01:12:47,096 --> 01:12:52,124
l hate to see you cry, Mom.

600
01:12:52,668 --> 01:12:54,363
l'm not crying!

601
01:12:55,237 --> 01:12:57,501
You're going to be better after
the operation tomorrow.

602
01:12:57,573 --> 01:12:59,234
l'm really not crying.

603
01:13:02,478 --> 01:13:03,740
l need to have a secret talk

604
01:13:04,980 --> 01:13:07,141
with Hani!

605
01:13:32,174 --> 01:13:33,436
Hani!

606
01:13:35,778 --> 01:13:40,647
Sneak up behind mom
and make

607
01:13:42,584 --> 01:13:45,951
her laugh by
surprising her, okay?

608
01:13:49,892 --> 01:13:52,452
HanByul...

609
01:13:53,195 --> 01:13:54,662
does it really hurt?

610
01:13:55,597 --> 01:13:57,224
l don't know.

611
01:13:58,667 --> 01:14:00,532
And...

612
01:14:03,472 --> 01:14:05,531
you have the punishment

613
01:14:06,675 --> 01:14:08,540
check book.

614
01:14:09,077 --> 01:14:14,140
l don't need it anymore.
Take it.

615
01:14:19,588 --> 01:14:21,249
Because...

616
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:24,554
you're...

617
01:14:25,794 --> 01:14:28,354
a good boy now...

618
01:14:30,065 --> 01:14:31,828
and...

619
01:14:53,188 --> 01:14:55,554
- l don't want to go inside.
- Yes, you'll be okay.

620
01:14:55,691 --> 01:15:00,560
- l don't want to! Mom, l don't hurt.
- HanByul!

621
01:15:00,696 --> 01:15:02,755
- l don't want to go inside!
- You'll be okay!

622
01:15:02,898 --> 01:15:04,627
- Mom, l already had an operation!
- Honey, go away. l will do!

623
01:15:04,766 --> 01:15:08,634
- HanByul, HanByul!
- l don't need another operation!

624
01:15:08,770 --> 01:15:12,137
Mom,
l'm not sick anymore.

625
01:15:12,274 --> 01:15:14,242
- l don't need another!
- Honey.

626
01:15:14,376 --> 01:15:16,742
- Mom.
- HanByul, l'll go with you.

627
01:15:16,879 --> 01:15:19,439
- HanByul, l'll go with you.
- No!

628
01:15:20,282 --> 01:15:24,048
Mom, l already had an operation!
Why do l need another one?

629
01:15:24,186 --> 01:15:26,950
- lt's okay! HanByul!
- Mom.

630
01:15:27,089 --> 01:15:28,852
Mommy will be here.

631
01:15:30,092 --> 01:15:32,458
- Mom!
- HanByul, don't cry.

632
01:15:32,594 --> 01:15:37,725
- Hanbyul, it's okay!
- Mom...

633
01:15:37,866 --> 01:15:38,833
Hani!

634
01:15:39,768 --> 01:15:41,235
HanByul.

635
01:15:42,471 --> 01:15:45,133
l don't need it!

636
01:16:43,365 --> 01:16:45,731
- Dad!
- Huh?

637
01:16:45,867 --> 01:16:47,926
When does the operation end?

638
01:16:48,670 --> 01:16:49,637
2 o'clock.

639
01:16:50,472 --> 01:16:52,133
You're late, go!

640
01:16:53,875 --> 01:16:55,934
Okay. Bye Dad!

641
01:17:19,668 --> 01:17:20,828
JANG Hani!

642
01:17:23,872 --> 01:17:29,333
- Why were you absent yesterday?
- My dog was sick. Real sick!

643
01:17:29,478 --> 01:17:32,641
- Did it die?
- No, it had pneumonia!

644
01:17:32,781 --> 01:17:36,342
lt almost died,
but now it's okay...

645
01:17:36,485 --> 01:17:38,851
Okay, see ya!

646
01:17:40,489 --> 01:17:41,649
JANG Hani!

647
01:17:43,792 --> 01:17:45,657
How's your brother?

648
01:18:10,786 --> 01:18:13,755
Please retrieve your cash.
Have a nice day.

649
01:18:54,596 --> 01:18:58,032
Hurry up!
We have to be back by two!

650
01:18:58,166 --> 01:18:59,531
l know!

651
01:19:53,088 --> 01:19:54,350
Here...

652
01:19:55,690 --> 01:19:57,248
lt should be here...

653
01:19:59,928 --> 01:20:01,395
the trees

654
01:20:04,366 --> 01:20:05,731
and the rocks are the same...

655
01:20:07,369 --> 01:20:08,233
JoonTae,

656
01:20:09,070 --> 01:20:10,537
l'm positive it's here!

657
01:20:12,073 --> 01:20:15,531
Tarzan man...
was...living here.

658
01:20:16,778 --> 01:20:18,336
Hey!
Where are you going?

659
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:20,038
- Mr. Tarzan!
- Hey!

660
01:20:20,182 --> 01:20:22,446
- Mr. Tarzan...
- JANG Hani!

661
01:20:22,584 --> 01:20:27,749
- Mr. Tarzan! Mr. Tarzan!
- JANG Hani!

662
01:20:29,191 --> 01:20:31,159
Mr. Tarzan!

663
01:20:43,772 --> 01:20:45,239
Mr. Tarzan!

664
01:20:47,676 --> 01:20:49,541
Mr. Tarzan!

665
01:20:56,184 --> 01:20:57,845
Mr. Tarzan!

666
01:21:08,363 --> 01:21:10,490
Heavy bleeding and
the difficult nature

667
01:21:10,565 --> 01:21:12,260
of the surgery required
2 more hours.

668
01:21:12,467 --> 01:21:15,368
Fortunately,
we removed the entire tumor,

669
01:21:16,271 --> 01:21:20,367
but...we'll need to observe
his brain function recovery.

670
01:21:21,376 --> 01:21:24,641
We have to watch him until
his conscious is back.

671
01:21:29,584 --> 01:21:31,745
There's no pupillary reaction.
Take a look at him.

672
01:21:45,367 --> 01:21:46,732
JAMG Hani!

673
01:21:53,475 --> 01:21:55,033
Mr. Tarzan!

674
01:22:12,093 --> 01:22:14,561
Hani, l found it!

675
01:22:19,768 --> 01:22:22,430
Pupillary reaction...
Negative.

676
01:23:31,373 --> 01:23:32,340
HanByul!

677
01:23:40,281 --> 01:23:42,442
- What're you doing here!
- My brother's in there!

678
01:23:42,584 --> 01:23:47,647
- You need to be sterilized here!
- He's JANG HanByul, l'm not lying!

679
01:23:47,789 --> 01:23:52,055
Mom! HanByul!
HanByul! Mom!

680
01:23:54,696 --> 01:23:56,459
You can't go in there!

681
01:23:56,598 --> 01:23:59,931
HanByul! HanByul!

682
01:24:00,068 --> 01:24:02,127
- Hani!
- HanByul!

683
01:24:02,270 --> 01:24:05,034
- Make him drink this water!
- Hani, you can't scream in here!

684
01:24:05,173 --> 01:24:09,633
He'll wake up if he does!
Make him drink this water!

685
01:24:09,778 --> 01:24:13,043
Make him drink this water!
Here, give him this!

686
01:24:13,181 --> 01:24:17,049
You have to give it to him!
He'll wake up then!

687
01:24:20,889 --> 01:24:23,153
- Water!
- Hani!

688
01:24:23,291 --> 01:24:30,026
Let go! Let go of me!
Let go of me! Let go!

689
01:24:30,165 --> 01:24:31,530
HanByul!

690
01:24:33,868 --> 01:24:36,428
- HanByul!
- Hani...

691
01:24:37,372 --> 01:24:38,532
HanByul!

692
01:24:39,274 --> 01:24:40,332
HanByul!

693
01:24:43,178 --> 01:24:48,548
- HanByul! HanByul!
- Can you hear Mommy?

694
01:24:55,990 --> 01:24:58,049
Open your eyes.

695
01:24:58,893 --> 01:25:00,360
