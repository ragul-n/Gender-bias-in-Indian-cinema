Is it the same cab delay again?

00:02:25,275 --> 00:02:27,841
There was heavy traffic on

Look Haripriya, it's been already two days 
that you've crossed your work deadline.

13
00:02:47,191 --> 00:02:48,561
Customers are bugging me like hell.

I will give you a maximum of two days.

The last cab has left and on 
top of that, it's raining.

00:03:42,233 --> 00:03:43,039
How do you go?

27
00:03:43,383 --> 00:03:46,183
No problem, I have already 
booked a private cab.

28
00:03:47,091 --> 00:03:48,609

Hey, you're eating everything in the

Mr Murthy, welcome.

My daughter's wedding is fixed 
on 10th day of the next month.

Good!

63
00:07:52,624 --> 00:07:53,590
You should attend along with your family.

64
00:07:53,985 --> 00:07:57,517
Not just my family, the entire 
supermarket gang would attend.

00:08:00,016 --> 00:08:02,319
She is working as software engineer.

67
00:08:02,386 --> 00:08:05,412
It's a happy thing, isn't it? Find a 
software engineer guy and get her married.

So soon? She is still a kid.

69

She's still munching on 5-star chocolates, 
and didn't start drinking breezer yet.

70
00:08:10,242 --> 00:08:11,414
Does that mean that you 
wouldn't you get her married?

71
00:08:11,614 --> 00:08:14,075
Of course, I would get her married. 
But let her enjoy her job for some time.

72
00:08:14,191 --> 00:08:15,621
It's better you get her married 
before she brings a guy and says,

73
00:08:15,789 --> 00:08:20,080
"Dad, he's my boyfriend 
and your son-in-law to be."

74

Even if it is her selection or ours,

75
00:08:24,724 --> 00:08:27,152
both of them should have a prosperous 
long life and that is what we wish for.

-What's the price of this item?

183
00:16:36,703 --> 00:16:39,536
-1250 rupees. 
-Tell the price you're gonna sell for?

184
00:16:39,746 --> 00:16:42,268
We get them for 100 
rupees per piece at Koti.

185

It means this entire supermarket is mine.

You are so lucky.

Have you eaten it?

257

Hey, just eat whatever you 
want and get me the bill.

-No!

You'd be late every day but 
you want your salary on time.

to come and leave whenever you want?

come late next time.

Okay. Let's go.

Girls of this generation even 
stopped naming them Kavita(poem)

302
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:16,466
How do you expect girls 
to fall for your poem?

303
00:27:16,973 --> 00:27:18,735
They'd take this tissue paper and throw 
it in the bin by wiping their mouths.

would be even better.

-Hey, let go of her. 
-Bro, she's setting a bait with Chunari.

00:28:08,387 --> 00:28:11,950
Is it so? So, 
I'm the big fish that fell for that bait.

Why didn't you give her ID card?

341

Because this ID card 
stays close to Sanjana's heart.

which her heart expresses every day.

00:29:37,818 --> 00:29:39,528
-Go away, dude. 
-What's with him to do with the signal?

354
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,744
Is he any mobile signal receiver tower?

355
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:44,119
He is our friend who uses Jio service. 
Respect him. We need his hotspot.

356

-Okay 
-Okay

Hey, my mobile... He stole my

Damn!

362
00:30:21,848 --> 00:30:24,476
Leave it, Arjun. 
The mobile is lost now!

363
00:30:25,155 --> 00:30:27,124
Hey, he must be somewhere over here.

364
00:30:27,904 --> 00:30:30,885
-What's your mobile's Wifi name? 
-Deepika Padukone.

365
00:30:31,528 --> 00:30:33,410
As if you're lacking 
just her in your life!

00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:34,691
Freaking idiot!

367

Arjun, we couldn't connect 
to that Wifi anywhere.

00:31:32,737 --> 00:31:35,505
You couldn't connect to Wifi but I've 
got connected to that rogue's team.

378
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,901
Come to my place, guys.

379
00:31:59,729 --> 00:32:00,359
Hey...

380
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:42,684
Give me the mobile.

381
00:32:43,853 --> 00:32:44,605
Give me the mobile.

382
00:32:46,396 --> 00:32:46,940
Hit you...

383
00:32:48,234 --> 00:32:48,698
Take this.

00:32:48,802 --> 00:32:50,491
-Hey! 
-You are superb, Arjun.

385
00:32:51,202 --> 00:32:53,930
Look, the customers made the 
floor dirty by their muddy feet.

386
00:32:53,954 --> 00:32:55,778
Just clean this and leave.

387
00:32:56,446 --> 00:32:57,922
Oh no! I'm getting late. 
See you.

388
00:33:31,508 --> 00:33:32,337
Does this vehicle go to Borabanda, bro?

-Hello-It's me, your mom.

392
00:34:24,931 --> 00:34:26,639
-How are you doing, son?  
-I'm doing good.

393
00:34:26,968 --> 00:34:29,032
-How about you?-I'm doing good, too.

The money lender has been creating 
scene about payment of interest amount.

395
00:34:32,712 --> 00:34:33,761
The payment of your 
sister's fee is also pending.

396
00:34:34,032 --> 00:34:36,252
Mom, give me the phone. 
I will talk to brother.

-Brother, when are you coming home?

Our neighbour Lakshmi's

...from the city on the 
ocassion of festival.

400
00:34:43,283 --> 00:34:45,895
You too will get me clothes, right? 
Why aren't you talking anything, brother?

401
00:34:46,136 --> 00:34:49,185
Tell me... Hello. Brother, you 
would get them for me, right?

Ah!

407
00:35:40,047 --> 00:35:42,628
Another corpse showed up, 
sir. It belongs to some girl.

408
00:35:43,164 --> 00:35:44,868
It's in a unidentifiable state.

409
00:35:45,167 --> 00:35:46,182
Any clues?

410
00:35:46,539 --> 00:35:47,174
No, sir.

411
00:35:49,857 --> 00:35:51,459
Send the deadbody to autopsy immediately.

412
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,950
If there was a missing case of a girl 
registered in our police station,

413
00:35:55,006 --> 00:35:56,990
inform the complainant and ask 
them to check with this dead body.

414
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:57,767
Okay, sir.

415
00:36:09,699 --> 00:36:12,921
Oh! Today's workload is umpteen.

416
00:36:13,128 --> 00:36:14,505
We might have to stay late.

417
00:36:14,712 --> 00:36:16,051
Yep. Might be.

418
00:36:17,731 --> 00:36:19,728
Well... Hey, I'm starving.

419
00:36:20,307 --> 00:36:21,156
Shall we go to cafeteria?

420
00:36:21,732 --> 00:36:22,436
Yeah, me too.

421
00:36:22,815 --> 00:36:24,384
-Okay, let's move. 
-Okay.

422
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:35,186
Sanju, look over there.

423
00:36:38,718 --> 00:36:40,167
Why is he stuck to me like this?

424
00:36:42,021 --> 00:36:42,863
[sighs impatiently]

425
00:36:43,063 --> 00:36:44,320
Hey... She's coming to us.

426
00:36:48,592 --> 00:36:51,539
Why the hell are you smiling? 
Do you think I'm your girlfriend?

427
00:36:51,635 --> 00:36:52,599
[snaps] 
Hello

428
00:36:53,079 --> 00:36:54,919
Why are you smiling as if you're 
the hero in a soap commercial?

429
00:36:55,924 --> 00:36:59,876
Oh, I got it! You want me to fall for 
your smile. That's what you want, right?

430
00:37:00,126 --> 00:37:03,374
I will place you here and take 
care of you, if you would fall so easily.

431
00:37:03,542 --> 00:37:06,770
The days where girls 
fall for flattery words are over.

432
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:07,972
Update a bit!

433
00:37:08,172 --> 00:37:09,911
We have get updated to impress a girl.

434
00:37:10,117 --> 00:37:12,661
But to make her fall in love, 
expressing our love to her is enough.

435
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:17,228
Don't you get my words? 
How can you even come to my office?

436
00:37:17,297 --> 00:37:17,903
I love you.

437
00:37:18,103 --> 00:37:18,711
What... What?

438
00:37:19,485 --> 00:37:21,197
What is it? Say it again.

439
00:37:21,205 --> 00:37:21,853
I love you.

440
00:37:24,169 --> 00:37:25,113
You've seen me on the 
day-before-yesterday.

441
00:37:25,738 --> 00:37:26,634
And you've followed me yesterday.

442
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:28,619
And you've proposed me today.

443
00:37:28,945 --> 00:37:31,689
[scoffs] Guys like you would 
come up with break-up tomorrow.

444
00:37:31,703 --> 00:37:32,964
Though it is late to fall in love,

445
00:37:33,136 --> 00:37:34,611
there shouldn't be any 
further delay after that.

446
00:37:34,988 --> 00:37:35,472
What?

447
00:37:35,485 --> 00:37:37,935
There's an old saying that goes 'Nothing 
can stop a wedding no matter what.'

448
00:37:38,035 --> 00:37:40,038
And now, he claims not to 
delay when you fall in love.

449
00:37:40,063 --> 00:37:40,575
Yes.

450
00:37:40,595 --> 00:37:41,540
I don't like all these things.

451
00:37:41,858 --> 00:37:44,115
Sanju, let's not get into this mess.

452
00:37:44,323 --> 00:37:45,493
Let's get out of here.

453
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,950
No guy considers going behind a girl 
as waste of time, after falling in love.

454
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:51,741
He would think he's 
spending time on his wife to be.

455
00:37:51,984 --> 00:37:52,888
So am I.

456
00:37:53,336 --> 00:37:54,886

Love me or hate me but 
I'll keep loving you.

Good morning, sir.

Any clues?

466
00:38:24,547 --> 00:38:26,660
The dead body belongs to the 
girl who got recently kidnapped.

467
00:38:26,809 --> 00:38:30,877
A sack contains her 
mobile, clothing and ID card.

468
00:38:31,171 --> 00:38:33,859
The phone is locked and 
we couldn't unlock it.

469
00:38:33,959 --> 00:38:35,505
We've sent that to our department, sir.

470
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:38,740
There was office address on her ID card 
and we've informed her office about her.

471
00:38:38,945 --> 00:38:39,607
Look,

472
00:38:40,231 --> 00:38:42,233
some guy chased a girl like an animal

473
00:38:42,457 --> 00:38:45,289
and threw her body in the 
public by chopping her into pieces.

474
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:48,322
Forget about respect, 
the public would disgust us.

475
00:38:48,593 --> 00:38:50,147
We should catch him as soon as possible.

476
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:50,954
Sir.

477
00:38:51,148 --> 00:38:52,646
Oh! Yuck!

Hey, watch out and walk.

That's the reason one should 
be attentive to their work.

Thank you.

484
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:43,969
Sanju, when he proposed to you, you should 
have said yes or no and closed that.

485
00:39:43,994 --> 00:39:45,407
But why would put a discussion?

486
00:39:46,428 --> 00:39:48,880
Should I accept his love upon proposing?

487
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:51,768
Nowadays, girls are not that so easy.

488
00:39:51,773 --> 00:39:53,351
What does he know about me?

489
00:39:53,421 --> 00:39:56,542
This kind of guys shouldn't be spared. 
We have to teach them some lesson.

490
00:39:56,742 --> 00:39:58,524
Hmm... Enough said.

491
00:39:58,764 --> 00:40:02,270
Girls who tell this kind of words 
would fall in love with them someday.

Love me or hate me, 
but I'll keep loving you.

00:40:17,969 --> 00:40:20,712
I'll come behind you. I love you.

496
00:40:20,912 --> 00:40:21,690
Oh no!

497
00:40:51,276 --> 00:40:55,831
How can a guy express his love 
to a girl without following her?

498
00:40:56,318 --> 00:40:58,026
It would be nice to 
bring a law that states

499
00:40:58,610 --> 00:41:03,849
it is no crime to propose to 
a girl without hurting her.

500
00:41:04,524 --> 00:41:07,716
I saw you for the first time 
when you were helping a kid.

501
00:41:15,016 --> 00:41:18,127
Your beauty made me not 
take my eyes off you

502
00:41:18,429 --> 00:41:23,518
I felt your sweet words to 
that kid as my love lessons.

503
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:26,285
That's it, my heart stopped obeying me.

504

It started to run behind you.

505
00:41:28,754 --> 00:41:32,699
You've come across me like a festival and 
made me feel this to be bond for lives.

506
00:41:33,337 --> 00:41:35,032
You've made me walk towards you.

507
00:41:38,258 --> 00:41:39,924
I feel I can't live without you.

508
00:41:40,123 --> 00:41:43,131
That's why I kept coming to 
the places wherever you went.

I love you, Sanjana.

00:41:49,321 --> 00:41:51,100
By the way, I didn't tell my name, right?

Yeah, good morning. 
Look, I give you a time of just two days

693
01:00:02,353 --> 01:00:04,290
Close the case before CBI interferes

694
01:00:04,490 --> 01:00:07,321
Else, they'll appoint a 
special officer from the center. Got it?

695
01:00:07,521 --> 01:00:08,569
Okay sir

696
01:00:08,769 --> 01:00:09,836
Greetings sir

697
01:00:14,180 --> 01:00:14,991
Sir...

698
01:00:16,055 --> 01:00:17,571
Tell me Ravi Kiran, any suspects?

699
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:18,627
No sir.

700
01:00:18,827 --> 01:00:24,246
When I enquired at her office, they said 
she left late due to excessive work load

701
01:00:24,636 --> 01:00:26,124
When I checked with the security...

702
01:00:26,315 --> 01:00:29,322
they said the manager was 
the last to leave, as usual

703
01:00:29,522 --> 01:00:30,982
Did you check with the manager then?

704
01:00:31,341 --> 01:00:33,867
We did sir, but he says he knows nothing.

705
01:00:35,636 --> 01:00:38,671
These are the details of the CC TV 
footage on the floor the girl works on

706
01:00:40,203 --> 01:00:44,145
She logged out of her 
computer at 9:08 pm sir

707
01:00:44,905 --> 01:00:47,981
The next are the details 
of the corridor CC TV, sir

708
01:00:48,353 --> 01:00:52,394
She left the office 
premises by 9.16 pm sir

709
01:00:53,188 --> 01:00:56,284
But, the manager left at 11 pm, sir

710
01:00:56,947 --> 01:00:59,202
According to the CC TV 
footage at the signals...

711
01:00:59,393 --> 01:01:01,532
the girl was kidnapped at 10 pm sir

712
01:01:02,355 --> 01:01:04,575
Look, 
we just have a time window of two days

713
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:07,337
After that, we would have to 
report to someone. Got that?

714
01:01:07,537 --> 01:01:08,750
-Sir... 
-Make it quick!

715
01:01:10,504 --> 01:01:12,176
Sir... one thing...

716
01:01:12,923 --> 01:01:17,416
Maybe we could find some clue 
if we enquire the girl's parents

717
01:01:17,616 --> 01:01:19,137
Go and be on it first

718
01:01:19,337 --> 01:01:20,867
-As you say sir. 
-Go now!

719
01:01:40,676 --> 01:01:41,804
Hello, Mr. Prasad...

720
01:01:42,948 --> 01:01:43,950
I'm Krishna Rao speaking

721
01:01:44,150 --> 01:01:46,611
I called you to say that I kept the 
10 lakh rupees that I owe you ready

722
01:01:47,288 --> 01:01:50,225
But, I'm travelling to Annavaram 
today and would return in two days

723
01:01:50,756 --> 01:01:52,195
I will bring them to 
you myself once I return

724
01:01:52,395 --> 01:01:53,666
Okay sir, thank you

725
01:01:54,354 --> 01:01:55,519
-Vinay! 
-Coming sir!

726
01:01:57,798 --> 01:01:59,488
-Sir... 
-I'm leaving to Annavaram today

727
01:01:59,688 --> 01:02:01,091
-Okay 
-Take care of the shop

728
01:02:01,372 --> 01:02:02,460
Okay sir

729
01:02:19,922 --> 01:02:21,046
Hey Arjun!

730
01:02:21,322 --> 01:02:22,746
Are you giving a treat 
for succeeding in love?

731
01:02:22,955 --> 01:02:28,107
Having no parents and siblings, 
you are all that I have

732
01:02:28,307 --> 01:02:30,018
So I wanted to celebrate with you

733
01:02:30,707 --> 01:02:32,190
Oh I love you dude!

734
01:02:33,175 --> 01:02:36,308
Man, you know well what your friends like

735
01:02:36,726 --> 01:02:38,191
You are a true friend!

736
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:41,372
[dogs barking]

737
01:03:02,730 --> 01:03:04,187
[message tone] 
Look!

738
01:03:04,387 --> 01:03:05,546
Sanjana sent a message

739
01:03:06,095 --> 01:03:09,282
She says she has a doubt in her subject, 
I'll clear that and come back in a jiffy

740
01:03:10,572 --> 01:03:13,281
Why doesn't this guy respond 
even to his girl friend's message?

741
01:03:13,766 --> 01:03:15,460
Damn! I shouldn't have messaged him

742
01:03:16,268 --> 01:03:17,344
Hi Sanjana!

743
01:03:18,325 --> 01:03:20,499
Hey Arjun! Why are you here?

744
01:03:21,556 --> 01:03:23,056
We will be in trouble if my dad wakes up!

745
01:03:23,659 --> 01:03:25,252
Well, you asked me what is love

746
01:03:26,709 --> 01:03:29,029
It's kind of hard to 
explain that in a message

747
01:03:29,969 --> 01:03:31,392
So, I wanted to explain that in person

748
01:03:32,227 --> 01:03:34,395
-Shut it. 
-Did you just say smooch it?

749
01:03:35,165 --> 01:03:37,156
Hey, I asked you to stop

750
01:03:38,430 --> 01:03:39,502
You leave first...

751
01:03:39,792 --> 01:03:42,612
Don't you think there should 
be a payment for my efforts?

752
01:03:44,027 --> 01:03:46,039
Here... 
take this custard apple and get going

753
01:03:46,837 --> 01:03:49,269
Would you come down directly 
in reply to a message?

754
01:03:49,742 --> 01:03:55,735
The wound inflicted by soft love is 
more painful than that by a sharp knife

755
01:03:57,677 --> 01:03:59,086
Would you treat my wound?

756
01:03:59,587 --> 01:04:00,631
[gasps]

757
01:04:01,163 --> 01:04:02,755
Why are you coming close to me?

758
01:04:07,406 --> 01:04:10,186
Would you stop just 
because if I ask you to?

759
01:04:15,013 --> 01:04:16,772
[thunders rumbling]

760
01:04:28,679 --> 01:04:29,880
[Sanjana chuckles]

761
01:04:31,136 --> 01:04:34,381
Isn't eating ice cream 
in rain a great idea?

762
01:04:35,499 --> 01:04:36,867
I have a dream since childhood

763
01:04:37,349 --> 01:04:42,218
I want to sit before a huge waterfall 
and eat an ice cream while its raining

764
01:04:54,980 --> 01:04:59,855
[music]

765
01:05:03,368 --> 01:05:05,552
"Wonderful!"

766
01:05:06,085 --> 01:05:09,892
"The beautiful girl has 
opened the window of her heart"

767
01:05:10,221 --> 01:05:12,464
"Wonderful!"

768
01:05:12,751 --> 01:05:17,573
"This lovely damsel has sung 
a song of love from heart"

769
01:05:21,574 --> 01:05:25,841
"You're a start who touched my heart"

770
01:05:26,169 --> 01:05:30,125
"Dear... oh my dear..."

771
01:05:30,808 --> 01:05:34,962
"I'm a fish that swam into your waters"

772
01:05:35,357 --> 01:05:39,325
"Dear... oh my dear..."

773
01:05:39,878 --> 01:05:42,183
"Oh girl..."

774
01:05:42,546 --> 01:05:46,274
"I've fallen in love with your love"

775
01:05:46,777 --> 01:05:48,909
"Because of you..."

776
01:05:49,387 --> 01:05:53,245
"I've become the love 
in love with your love"

777
01:05:53,657 --> 01:05:55,901
"Wonderful!"

778
01:05:56,554 --> 01:06:00,213
"The beautiful girl has 
opened the window of her heart"

779
01:06:00,876 --> 01:06:02,693
"Wonderful!"

780
01:06:03,338 --> 01:06:07,408
"This lovely damsel has sung 
a song of love from heart"

781
01:06:07,508 --> 01:06:11,658
"You're a start who touched my heart"

782
01:06:12,339 --> 01:06:15,797
"Dear... oh my dear..."

783
01:06:16,446 --> 01:06:20,750
"I'm a fish that swam into your waters"

784
01:06:21,357 --> 01:06:24,921
"Dear... oh my dear..."

785
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:50,335
"Being half of you in every era"

786
01:06:50,797 --> 01:06:54,737
"I'll take birth for you"

787
01:06:55,324 --> 01:06:59,644
"My heart drives me all the time"

788
01:06:59,909 --> 01:07:04,172
"to have a never ending journey with you"

789
01:07:04,429 --> 01:07:06,581
"Oh girl..."

790
01:07:07,019 --> 01:07:10,903
"You've entered my world like heaven"

791
01:07:11,340 --> 01:07:17,333
"I'm smitten by love because of you..."

792
01:07:18,174 --> 01:07:20,374
"Wonderful!"

793
01:07:21,195 --> 01:07:24,770
"The beautiful girl has 
opened the window of her heart"

794
01:07:25,481 --> 01:07:27,379
"Wonderful!"

795
01:07:28,018 --> 01:07:32,272
"This lovely damsel has sung 
a song of love from heart"

796
01:07:51,116 --> 01:07:52,214
Are you Arjun?

797
01:07:52,576 --> 01:07:53,771
Yes sir, what do you want?

798
01:07:53,971 --> 01:07:55,825
-The Sub-inspector wants to see you 
-The Sub-inspector? What for?

799
01:07:56,263 --> 01:07:57,601
Sanjana was murdered last night

800
01:07:57,801 --> 01:07:59,163
Someone had killed her. 
We have questions to ask

801
01:07:59,363 --> 01:08:00,938
Murdered? 
What the hell are you talking sir?

802
01:08:01,244 --> 01:08:02,517
Come with us silently

803
01:08:03,462 --> 01:08:04,503
-Come 
-Come on!

804
01:08:04,859 --> 01:08:06,229
We haven't arrested anyone yet sir

805
01:08:06,745 --> 01:08:08,008
Investigation is on...

806
01:08:08,713 --> 01:08:10,222
We haven't yet got the 
post mortem report too

807
01:08:10,750 --> 01:08:12,576
Okay sir. I'll hang up.

808
01:08:14,222 --> 01:08:15,154
[sighs]

809
01:08:16,374 --> 01:08:18,280
Such a vicious circle...

810
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:20,584
Yet another murder case on me to solve

811
01:08:27,145 --> 01:08:28,808
-Come here Ravi Kiran 
-Sir...

812
01:08:31,368 --> 01:08:34,021
Did you get to know where the parents 
of that girl are and informed them?

813
01:08:34,221 --> 01:08:35,449
We have passed on the 
information last night sir

814
01:08:35,649 --> 01:08:36,818
They went to Annavaram

815
01:08:37,115 --> 01:08:39,002
They just returned back to 
Hyderabad today morning sir

816
01:08:39,439 --> 01:08:42,756
Krishna Rao, the girl's father 
has taken her dead body home, sir

817
01:08:42,967 --> 01:08:44,134
Okay then

818
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:48,126
Give them some time and then 
ask them if they doubt someone

819
01:08:48,326 --> 01:08:49,146
Okay sir

820
01:08:49,346 --> 01:08:51,953
-Ask the neighbours too 
-Oka sir

821
01:08:52,522 --> 01:08:57,087
Check if someone was found to be 
roaming around suspiciously about 10 pm

822
01:08:57,287 --> 01:08:57,995
Okay sir

823
01:08:58,451 --> 01:09:00,034
Sir, we got the girl's boy friend

824
01:09:00,234 --> 01:09:01,301
Get him in

825
01:09:08,938 --> 01:09:09,886
What's your name man?

826
01:09:10,086 --> 01:09:10,973
Arjun sir

827
01:09:11,173 --> 01:09:12,233
What do you do?

828
01:09:12,591 --> 01:09:13,799
I'm being trained in Kick boxing, sir

829
01:09:13,999 --> 01:09:15,062
[inspector chuckles] 
Boxing...

830
01:09:15,262 --> 01:09:16,561
To bash whom man? Huh?

831
01:09:17,891 --> 01:09:19,336
Where were you at 10 pm, last night?

832
01:09:19,903 --> 01:09:21,240
I was in training at the academy sir

833
01:09:22,327 --> 01:09:23,704
Which place trains people till 10 pm?

834
01:09:24,509 --> 01:09:27,751
State level competitions are fast 
approaching. Hence the late night practice

835
01:09:28,346 --> 01:09:30,772
Fine. Since when do you know Sanjana?

836
01:09:32,018 --> 01:09:33,060
Since the past three months

837
01:09:33,820 --> 01:09:35,470
Does she have any boy 
friends apart from you?

838
01:09:35,811 --> 01:09:38,193
Whom does she keep calling 
and sending messages?

839
01:09:39,878 --> 01:09:41,964
No sir, nothing of that sort ever happened

840
01:09:44,012 --> 01:09:45,497
When was the last you spoke to her?

841
01:09:47,055 --> 01:09:48,133
Two days back, sir

842
01:09:48,708 --> 01:09:49,692
You say you're her boy friend!

843
01:09:49,892 --> 01:09:51,785
People keep messaging and calling 
each other throughout the day

844
01:09:51,985 --> 01:09:53,295
Tell me the truth, 
when was the last you met her?

845
01:09:54,012 --> 01:09:55,675
I couldn't talk to her as 
I was busy in practice sir

846
01:09:56,345 --> 01:09:58,762
Okay.. pretty well then

847
01:09:58,863 --> 01:10:00,329
Do you doubt someone in this?

848
01:10:01,553 --> 01:10:02,645
No sir

849
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:06,630
I'll kill you if someone utters 
your name in the investigation.

850
01:10:07,070 --> 01:10:08,406
Tell me straight when did you talk to her?

851
01:10:09,627 --> 01:10:11,078
I did talk to her two days back sir

852
01:10:13,533 --> 01:10:14,934
Okay... Venkat Rao...

853
01:10:15,712 --> 01:10:16,596
Sir...

854
01:10:18,633 --> 01:10:19,232
Sir...

855
01:10:19,432 --> 01:10:21,011
Take his signature and 
fingerprints and send him

856
01:10:21,228 --> 01:10:21,959
-Okay 
-Out...

857
01:10:22,159 --> 01:10:23,018
Come here

858
01:10:24,259 --> 01:10:25,585
-Ravi Kiran 
-Sir...

859
01:10:26,188 --> 01:10:27,692
-Keep a watch on him 
-As you say sir

860
01:10:27,892 --> 01:10:29,793
-Watch him all time time 
-Okay sir

861
01:10:34,196 --> 01:10:35,850
[sobbing] 
My dear girl...

862
01:10:36,312 --> 01:10:37,922
Are you sleeping my girl?

863
01:10:38,122 --> 01:10:41,859
Get up once dear, look at dad once

864
01:10:42,059 --> 01:10:44,229
Call me 'Dad' lovingly

865
01:10:44,563 --> 01:10:45,896
[sobbing] 
Oh no!

866
01:10:46,201 --> 01:10:49,111
Whom do I lovingly call 'Sanjana' now? 
[sobs]

867
01:10:52,870 --> 01:10:54,399
Did you see sir...

868
01:10:55,182 --> 01:10:57,581
Look how those demons killed her

869
01:10:58,123 --> 01:11:04,093
What an atrocity... 
you tell me how is this right sir

870
01:11:05,540 --> 01:11:10,278
I thoguht I'd cry sending her to 
her in-law's place but not like this

871
01:11:11,380 --> 01:11:13,534
[sobbing] 
Sanjana my dear, get up!

872
01:11:21,616 --> 01:11:22,538
Stop there!

873
01:11:25,146 --> 01:11:26,377
Wasn't it you?

874
01:11:27,054 --> 01:11:29,013
Wasn't it you who took Sanjana on a bike?

875
01:11:29,538 --> 01:11:31,137
Wasn't it you who trapped her?

876
01:11:31,337 --> 01:11:33,454
Tell me you! You must have done something!

877
01:11:33,769 --> 01:11:36,266
You've killed her! 
Why did you kill my darling girl?

878
01:11:36,696 --> 01:11:39,469
Was it money? I would have given 
my entire earnings in return!

879
01:11:39,792 --> 01:11:42,505
Mr. Rao, please calm down. Stop

880
01:11:43,290 --> 01:11:45,034
-He must be the culprit sir! 
-I'll talk to him, please come

881
01:11:45,914 --> 01:11:48,055
My daughter was so innocent

882
01:11:49,126 --> 01:11:53,467
How could you even think 
of harming her so badly?

883
01:11:56,626 --> 01:11:59,919
Why would I kill Sanjana, 
whom I loved more than my life?

884
01:12:00,051 --> 01:12:01,794
I don't know who you are boy

885
01:12:02,037 --> 01:12:03,992
But they are in the grief of 
losing their daughter right now

886
01:12:04,192 --> 01:12:06,137
You better not stay here. 
Please leave immediately

887
01:12:06,598 --> 01:12:07,737
Please leave

888
01:12:50,718 --> 01:12:51,535

Arjun...

890
01:13:08,614 --> 01:13:10,486
Arjun... you should come with me at once

891
01:13:22,140 --> 01:13:24,159
So you know about Sanjana's murder

892
01:13:28,483 --> 01:13:31,828
Your silence makes me doubt you

893
01:13:34,202 --> 01:13:35,589
I didn't kill Sanjana sir

894
01:13:37,309 --> 01:13:39,431
Then what's with the 
bloodened clothes and your attire?

895
01:13:39,994 --> 01:13:41,862
She committed suicide right before my eyes

896
01:13:43,838 --> 01:13:44,599
Suicide?

897
01:13:44,904 --> 01:13:46,137
She has a habit of taking drugs

898
01:13:47,006 --> 01:13:48,685
She doesn't understand 
what she does at that time

899
01:13:50,450 --> 01:13:52,269
She proposed that we get 
married yesterday night

900
01:13:53,367 --> 01:13:54,742
I told her there's still time for that

901
01:13:55,159 --> 01:13:57,966
Without understanding why, 
she created a mess!

902
01:14:00,133 --> 01:14:03,508
She started banging her head to the wall

903
01:14:06,478 --> 01:14:08,409
I wanted to save her 
under all circumstances

904
01:14:11,153 --> 01:14:12,526
I tried to stop her, sir

905
01:14:13,435 --> 01:14:14,758
But she pushed me away

906
01:14:16,315 --> 01:14:19,133
When I stood up and looked at her

907
01:14:19,635 --> 01:14:21,493
she was badly wounded on her head

908
01:14:23,824 --> 01:14:25,536
and Sanjana died on the spot sir

909
01:14:26,055 --> 01:14:27,908
My Sanjana is dead sir!

910
01:14:28,858 --> 01:14:29,691
Is it?

911
01:14:29,905 --> 01:14:32,022
Come, 
let's explain what happened to the police

912
01:14:35,113 --> 01:14:37,782
You who know me closely doubted me

913
01:14:39,190 --> 01:14:43,092
Now if we tell this to the cops, 
they will think I'm the murderer for sure

914
01:14:43,731 --> 01:14:46,012
If that happens, I can't go to 
the state level competition sir

915
01:14:51,227 --> 01:14:53,724
Yes, thats true. Don't worry.

916
01:14:55,811 --> 01:14:57,567

Hello Inspector

928
01:15:51,933 --> 01:15:53,159
Hello? Just a minute sir

929
01:15:53,622 --> 01:15:54,757
Sir, it's the DSP

930
01:15:57,187 --> 01:15:58,046
Good morning sir

931
01:15:58,246 --> 01:15:59,432
Have you got any clues?

932
01:16:00,147 --> 01:16:01,623
Investigation is going on sir

933
01:16:01,823 --> 01:16:04,984
-We'll nab the murderer in 24 hours 
-It's been 14 hours since the murder

934
01:16:05,184 --> 01:16:07,272
You've been unable to trace 
out even a single clue

935
01:16:07,502 --> 01:16:09,038
It's the sixth murder in the city already

936
01:16:09,355 --> 01:16:13,860
That's why I appointed detective 
Aditya Vardhan to help you with this case

He is an expert in 
solving mysterious murders

Please co-operate with him

Sir, please listen to me

01:16:19,701 --> 01:16:20,994
Give us another two days

941
01:16:21,475 --> 01:16:22,867
We'll nab the murderer for sure

942
01:16:26,150 --> 01:16:28,725
We feel this murder was 
committed just for money

943
01:16:29,098 --> 01:16:31,726
We don't even know if this murder is 
related to the previous murders sir

944
01:16:32,079 --> 01:16:34,055
Just follow the instructions. That's it!

945
01:16:37,122 --> 01:16:38,815

The door is open. Come inside

952
01:17:15,709 --> 01:17:16,640

You wanted to talk something Ravi?

956
01:17:37,674 --> 01:17:38,890
Well, it's nothing sir

957
01:17:39,288 --> 01:17:41,224
SI sir wanted me to give these to you

958
01:17:41,855 --> 01:17:42,579
What are they?

959
01:17:42,978 --> 01:17:45,647
These are the evidence found 
at the murder spot that day

960
01:17:46,077 --> 01:17:48,531

All of them are happening in the 
areas surrounding Hitech City

966
01:19:35,661 --> 01:19:37,993
Which means, 
the murderer should be around these areas

967
01:19:39,088 --> 01:19:41,357
Wherever you are, you can't escape

He is detective Aditya Vardhan

He is about to deal your 
daughter's murder case

975
01:20:18,833 --> 01:20:21,614
Sir, we found her dead body right 
here on the day of her murder

01:20:23,926 --> 01:20:24,697
[camera clicks]

977
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:28,240
Do you know who else was present 
at home on the day of murder?

978
01:20:28,845 --> 01:20:31,365
This door was left open 
on the day of murder sir

979
01:20:32,191 --> 01:20:33,387
The door lock is broken

980
01:20:43,828 --> 01:20:48,179
On the day of murder, two people entered 
this house without knowing about the other

981
01:20:48,608 --> 01:20:49,996
Two people sir?

982
01:20:50,335 --> 01:20:51,803
Without the knowledge of the other?

983
01:20:53,861 --> 01:20:54,840
But why did two people come?

984
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:56,765
One for money and the other for the girl

985
01:20:57,343 --> 01:20:59,901
Or have they both come for the 
money and killed the girl by mistake?

986
01:21:00,938 --> 01:21:02,008
We need to clarify this

987
01:21:02,818 --> 01:21:04,089
How is that possible sir?

988
01:21:04,905 --> 01:21:07,593
Anyway, 
how can you say that it's two people?

989
01:21:09,503 --> 01:21:11,938
You need to have a 
proper planning for theft

990
01:21:12,660 --> 01:21:15,900
One has to observe this 
house and it's residents

991
01:21:16,495 --> 01:21:18,695
So, 
he must have planned this 10 days earlier

992
01:21:19,406 --> 01:21:23,750
He would have a lot of clarity about 
how to enter and exit this house

993
01:21:31,285 --> 01:21:32,450
Look, this is unplanned

994
01:21:33,078 --> 01:21:37,440
It's definitely the murderer who broke 
the window glass beside the main door

995
01:21:37,640 --> 01:21:38,599
Okay sir

996
01:21:42,201 --> 01:21:43,395
Do you doubt someone?

997
01:21:44,163 --> 01:21:45,552
We don't have any foes sir

998
01:21:46,345 --> 01:21:48,966
And no one has so much anger 
on us to kill our daughter

999
01:21:50,995 --> 01:21:53,683
Long back, someone attacked our daughter 
when she was coming home from work

1000
01:21:55,004 --> 01:21:56,392
But we didn't think much about it

1001
01:21:57,895 --> 01:21:59,844
Do you have any idea 
about who he could be?

1002
01:22:00,514 --> 01:22:04,078
We thought someone attacked 
her for money as she was alone

1003
01:22:05,194 --> 01:22:07,936
We didn't register a complaint 
as she was an unmarried girl

1004
01:22:10,598 --> 01:22:15,675
But sometime ago, we noticed a young 
man named Arjun following our daughter

1005
01:22:17,087 --> 01:22:18,724
Do you doubt he could have killed her?

1006
01:22:19,141 --> 01:22:21,402
Er... no

1007
01:22:22,104 --> 01:22:24,236
Do you doubt anyone in your supermarket?

1008
01:22:24,740 --> 01:22:26,254
No sir, our employees aren't bad

1009
01:22:32,006 --> 01:22:35,640
Okay, I've heard that she was alone 
at home on the night of murder

1010
01:22:36,010 --> 01:22:37,370
Why didn't she accompany you to Annavaram?

1011
01:22:37,948 --> 01:22:42,072
She had some work at office and 
said she couldn't take a leave

1012
01:22:42,405 --> 01:22:43,429
So we both left

1013
01:22:43,629 --> 01:22:44,631
Okay Mr. Krishna Rao...

1014
01:22:44,831 --> 01:22:48,603
In case you doubt someone or need to 
contact me, this is my phone number

1015
01:22:48,803 --> 01:22:49,573
-Okay sir 
-Call me

1016
01:22:49,773 --> 01:22:50,739
-Thank you 
-Ravi Kiran...

1017
01:22:50,939 --> 01:22:51,506
Yes sir...

1018
01:22:51,706 --> 01:22:53,719
We need to meet Sanjana's 
close friends immediately

1019
01:22:53,944 --> 01:22:54,911
-Sir 
-Get me the details

1020
01:22:55,111 --> 01:22:55,868
Okay sir

1021
01:22:58,176 --> 01:22:59,513
Yeah okay.

1022
01:23:00,049 --> 01:23:01,936
I'll be there in half an hour. Okay?

1023
01:23:02,866 --> 01:23:04,205
-Tell me Ravi Kiran 
-Yes sir

1024
01:23:04,515 --> 01:23:05,537
What says our detective?

1025
01:23:05,737 --> 01:23:07,655
Ah! I can't bear him sir!

1026
01:23:08,179 --> 01:23:13,140
He is investigating using thrown away 
medicine bottles and broken window panes

1027
01:23:14,091 --> 01:23:15,955
It's not even 24 hours 
since he took charge

1028
01:23:16,387 --> 01:23:18,429
After two days of toil, he will run 
back saying it's unsolvable

1029
01:23:19,250 --> 01:23:21,755
We will close the case claiming it 
a suicide due to lack of evidence

1030
01:23:22,215 --> 01:23:27,051
No sir, looking at his ways, 
I think he might nab the murderer for sure

1031
01:23:27,251 --> 01:23:28,252
Easy breezy...

1032
01:23:28,452 --> 01:23:31,154
Call the hospital and inquire 
about the post mortem report

1033
01:23:31,354 --> 01:23:32,224
Okay sir

1034
01:23:32,609 --> 01:23:34,441

I don't know how was he given this post

01:24:45,445 --> 01:24:47,026
I want this. Where can I get it?

1039
01:24:50,236 --> 01:24:52,094
Hey... stop.

1040
01:24:52,688 --> 01:24:54,699
Hey! Stop there! You!

1041
01:25:08,424 --> 01:25:09,616
Why is the SI here?

1042
01:25:13,636 --> 01:25:14,814
What work does he have here?

1043
01:25:30,546 --> 01:25:31,604
Excuse me...

1044
01:25:33,589 --> 01:25:34,641
Why is that man here?

1045
01:25:35,366 --> 01:25:36,869
Oh you mean SI Jayadev?

1046
01:25:37,118 --> 01:25:39,313
He is undergoing a treatment 
here since six months

1047
01:25:39,668 --> 01:25:41,518
Well, I needed a small information

1048
01:25:41,718 --> 01:25:42,804
Tell me what you want to know sir

1049
01:25:43,873 --> 01:25:46,329
-Serial number 11 on 20th of this month 
-Okay

1050
01:25:46,619 --> 01:25:48,765
This one is burnt. 
I need the patient details

1051
01:25:49,503 --> 01:25:50,735
I need to buy the medicines

1052
01:25:53,029 --> 01:25:54,280
How is the patient related to you?

1053
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:55,844
Well...

1054
01:25:56,551 --> 01:25:57,516
He's my brother

1055
01:25:58,717 --> 01:25:59,831
Wait a minute sir

1056
01:26:01,019 --> 01:26:02,387
Here are the details you've asked for

1057
01:26:03,671 --> 01:26:04,518
Deva...

1058
01:26:04,718 --> 01:26:05,755
What did you say his name is?

1059
01:26:06,492 --> 01:26:07,491
Jayadev sir

1060
01:26:08,344 --> 01:26:09,917
[to himself] 
Are Deva and Jayadev the same person?

1061
01:26:10,517 --> 01:26:11,628
Anything else sir?

1062
01:26:12,290 --> 01:26:13,702
Nothing. Thank you

1063
01:26:53,621 --> 01:26:55,676
Why is Sanjana's father meeting the SI?

1064
01:26:56,196 --> 01:26:57,352
That too at such an odd time?

1065
01:26:58,156 --> 01:26:59,603
How are both related?

1066
01:27:00,063 --> 01:27:01,466
Is Deva none other than this Jayadev?

1067
01:27:01,985 --> 01:27:03,583
Why is he meeting Sanjana's father then?

1068

This is not SI's number!

Deva... Krishna Rao Super Market

1075
01:27:49,703 --> 01:27:52,308
How is Deva connected to Sanjana's father?

1078
01:28:15,030 --> 01:28:16,359

[phone ringing tone]

1080
01:28:23,986 --> 01:28:25,670
Till now, in Sanjana's murder case

1081
01:28:25,907 --> 01:28:29,141
There is no link between the serial 
murders happening in the city to this one

1082
01:28:29,524 --> 01:28:32,995
Someone killed the girl brutally 
only for money is what we learnt

1083
01:28:34,102 --> 01:28:35,231
On the day of murder

1084
01:28:35,431 --> 01:28:37,801
10 lakhs of cash was lost from her home  
[phone keeps ringing]

-Whom are you here for, son? 
-Deva

1094
01:30:07,074 --> 01:30:09,504
I'm looking for the one who 
works at Krishna Rao supermarket

1095
01:30:09,697 --> 01:30:11,919
That young man vacated the place long back

1096
01:30:12,979 --> 01:30:14,414
Vacated?

1097
01:30:16,157 --> 01:30:17,539
Do you know where he shifted to now?

1098
01:30:17,829 --> 01:30:20,100
I know nothing about him. Crap!

1099
01:30:24,045 --> 01:30:25,092
Damn!

1100
01:30:26,780 --> 01:30:27,977
Where could he be?

01:30:53,991 --> 01:30:55,339
I'm loving this place!

You my love beside me

It's an awesome feeling Arjun!

1108
01:31:09,826 --> 01:31:11,479
-Close your eyes once 
-Why?

1109
01:31:11,679 --> 01:31:12,827
Just close your eyes!

1110
01:31:13,707 --> 01:31:15,953
-Don't open them till I tell you. Okay? 
-Okay

1112
01:31:19,702 --> 01:31:20,763

1113
01:31:22,165 --> 01:31:23,233
Open your eyes

1114
01:31:25,204 --> 01:31:26,209
Surprise!

1115
01:31:26,409 --> 01:31:28,001
Oh my god! I can't believe this!

1116
01:31:33,804 --> 01:31:39,321
If I have any unforgettable moments in 
my life, they are the ones spent with you

1117
01:31:39,882 --> 01:31:45,823
I casually said I wanted to sit before 
a waterfall in rain and eat an ice cream

1118
01:31:46,349 --> 01:31:47,743
And you made it a reality!

1119
01:31:48,797 --> 01:31:51,318
I could see a smile on your 
face when you were telling me

1120
01:31:52,139 --> 01:31:56,187
I wanted to see the happiness in 
your face when it turns to reality

1121
01:31:56,590 --> 01:31:57,921
Don't you have any such crazy wishes?

1122
01:31:58,457 --> 01:31:59,932
I have a similar wish too

1123
01:32:00,134 --> 01:32:03,632
Actually, 
I don't want my ice cream in a cup

1124
01:32:04,992 --> 01:32:06,667
It should be served on 
my girl friend's lips

1125
01:32:07,897 --> 01:32:09,628
Hey! Looking for an ice cream?

1126
01:32:10,022 --> 01:32:11,055
-Want to eat ice cream? 
-Yeah!

1127
01:32:11,255 --> 01:32:12,085
-Idiot!

1130
01:32:23,977 --> 01:32:24,997
Do we get married?

1131

rain before this god if you say yes

happiness in your companionship?"

I want to see beauty"

Son... son!

1177
01:36:24,306 --> 01:36:26,146
I told you I don't know anything about him

1178
01:36:35,308 --> 01:36:38,787
Anyway, how can you claim that two 
people barged in without any proofs?

1179
01:36:39,011 --> 01:36:40,420
No! I have evidences!

1180
01:36:40,620 --> 01:36:42,548
[scoffs] 
Evidence? And what is it?

1181
01:36:44,341 --> 01:36:45,965
According to the post mortem record, 
it's a murder

1182
01:36:46,501 --> 01:36:48,199
The girl was killed very brutally

1183
01:36:49,136 --> 01:36:52,770
There is some link between the serial 
murders happened in the city and this one

1184
01:36:53,074 --> 01:36:54,991
They are injecting this 
drug into the girl's bodies

1185
01:36:55,234 --> 01:36:58,366
molesting them and killing them by 
hitting them with a strong metal rod

1186
01:36:58,767 --> 01:37:00,542
None of these murders 
were committed for money

1187
01:37:01,323 --> 01:37:05,114
They cut the dead bodies into small pieces 
and throw them in different places

1188
01:37:05,314 --> 01:37:07,099
There are injection marks 
on this girl's body too

1189
01:37:07,824 --> 01:37:10,689
The earlier murders of the other girls 
were also in the same pattern

1190
01:37:11,500 --> 01:37:13,257
13 murders were committed till now

1191
01:37:13,721 --> 01:37:15,892
Only six murders are filed in our station

1192
01:37:16,349 --> 01:37:19,302
Another seven murders have been 
recorded in different stations

1193
01:37:19,661 --> 01:37:22,649
Sir, do you mean to say that it's the 
same person behind all these murders

1194
01:37:22,849 --> 01:37:23,990
Yes, you got the point

1195
01:37:24,375 --> 01:37:27,951
Then why didn't he cut this girl 
into pieces? Is this some other guy?

1196
01:37:29,662 --> 01:37:31,290
Maybe it's to misguide the cops

1197
01:37:31,748 --> 01:37:35,214
But, this murder has a lot of 
similarities to the past murders

1198
01:37:35,523 --> 01:37:36,224
Oh...

1199
01:37:36,580 --> 01:37:40,172
According to my investigation, all these 
murders are committed by a psycho killer

1200
01:37:40,712 --> 01:37:42,202
But I'm sure he didn't commit the theft

1201
01:37:42,511 --> 01:37:43,693
A psycho killer?

1202
01:37:44,402 --> 01:37:46,240
What would he get by killing 
those poor girls sir?

1203
01:37:46,737 --> 01:37:50,147
We can't say for sure why 
he is targeting only girls

1204
01:37:50,978 --> 01:37:53,875
They do this because of some past events

1205
01:37:55,490 --> 01:37:58,354
Maybe the death of their mother in their 
childhood and no one to care about them

1206
01:37:58,891 --> 01:38:00,890
or maybe because their 
girl friend cheated them

1207
01:38:01,308 --> 01:38:04,798
Or maybe they get some 
happiness by killing girls

1208
01:38:05,300 --> 01:38:06,215
Anything could be the reason

1209
01:38:06,488 --> 01:38:08,641
Ah! It's scary to hear sir!

1210
01:38:08,968 --> 01:38:10,307
Don't know how they would look like?

1211
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:12,773
They behave very normal when in public

1212
01:38:13,219 --> 01:38:15,697
Their original personality comes 
out only when they are alone

1213
01:38:18,970 --> 01:38:20,598
Yes, he is right

1214
01:38:22,910 --> 01:38:24,692
All these murders are 
committed by that psycho killer

1215
01:38:25,753 --> 01:38:27,134
But I'm unable to understand something

1216
01:38:27,567 --> 01:38:29,879
He has been killing one 
girl at a time in different areas

1217
01:38:30,831 --> 01:38:32,924
That too he always targeted 
girls below age of 30

1218
01:38:33,868 --> 01:38:35,478
He wouldn't stop here

1219
01:38:36,375 --> 01:38:38,380
He should have planned 
another murder somewhere

1220
01:38:38,821 --> 01:38:39,916
I'm sure he would

1221
01:38:40,116 --> 01:38:42,535
He committed all these 
murders by injecting this drug

1222
01:38:44,500 --> 01:38:47,141
We will get the clue to nab him if we 
could trace out where we can find this

According to the detective

1226
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,654
-He saw that guy with drugs in this area 
-Is sit?

1227
01:39:17,039 --> 01:39:17,927
Huh!

1228
01:39:19,244 --> 01:39:21,269
Come... hey! He's right here!

1229
01:39:24,014 --> 01:39:24,710
Huh!

1230
01:39:24,910 --> 01:39:25,908
Hey, catch him

1231
01:39:26,449 --> 01:39:29,370

Where is the guy I called you about?

1250
01:41:29,251 --> 01:41:30,343

Vincent, do you recognise this guy?

1259
01:43:14,526 --> 01:43:16,175
Who the hell are you? 
Why are you asking me these details

1260
01:43:16,559 --> 01:43:17,666
Do you recognise him?

Sir, we have Sanjana's call details 
[man keeps groaning]

01:46:32,467 --> 01:46:35,208
It shows the last 12 calls were 
made by a young man called Arjun

-There are no calls recorded after that

-All the details are in this sir 
-Go now

Where's the money from?

-Come on say the truth! 
-They are mine sir!

1294

Where did you get the money from?

-What's happening man? 
-Sir...

1297
01:46:51,107 --> 01:46:52,796
Why are you making a big scene 
to extract a simple truth?

1298
01:46:52,996 --> 01:46:54,504
He isn't disclosing it 
however I bash him sir

1299
01:46:55,058 --> 01:46:57,436
Get to know his address and 
ask someone who knows him

1300
01:46:57,707 --> 01:46:59,967
He works at Krishna Rao Supermarket sir

-Come again! 
-Krishna Rao Supermarket sir

1302

-I plead you 
-You've given us a hard time!

Why did you kill that girl?

1306
01:47:13,702 --> 01:47:18,546
Why did you have to drug that girl and 
kill her so brutally if it was for money?

1307
01:47:18,766 --> 01:47:21,228
Huh? Come on tell me you!

1309
01:47:23,162 --> 01:47:27,723
I didn't do it sir. I don't have to 
do anything with that girl's death

1310

I plead you, please leave me sir!

Hey, get the drug seller

1312
01:47:35,448 --> 01:47:37,445
Is he the one who bought drugs from you?

1313
01:47:37,815 --> 01:47:39,960
I've never seen this guy earlier sir

1314
01:47:42,218 --> 01:47:43,414
Tell me the truth if it's him!

1315
01:47:43,897 --> 01:47:45,647
No sir. 
This is the first time I'm seeing him

-Ravi Kiran... 
-Sir

1317

Thrash them till they spill the beans

1318
01:47:49,144 --> 01:47:50,212
Bash them up!

I'll tell you the truth sir

Tell me!

1325
01:48:13,771 --> 01:48:15,958
Why did you kill that girl? Tell me!

1326
01:48:17,676 --> 01:48:19,906
I'm in love with a girl sir

1327
01:48:20,569 --> 01:48:25,811
But she said her parents would get 
her married only to a wealthy guy

1328
01:48:27,063 --> 01:48:28,778
So I wanted to become wealthy somehow

1329
01:48:29,574 --> 01:48:32,323
So, once I knew our owner 
wasn't at home that day

1330
01:49:30,989 --> 01:49:32,907
I just stole the money that day sir

1331
01:49:33,351 --> 01:49:35,117
I don't have anything 
to do with her death sir

1332
01:49:35,385 --> 01:49:36,886
Please leave me sir!

1333
01:49:37,358 --> 01:49:38,768
I didn't kill that girl sir

1334
01:49:39,980 --> 01:49:41,587
-I didn't kill her sir 
-You didn't, eh?

1335
01:49:41,787 --> 01:49:43,561
-Then tell me who did? 
-It was her boy friend

1336
01:49:43,837 --> 01:49:44,932
Her boy friend?

I'll kill you in an encounter

1342
01:49:58,455 --> 01:50:00,131
Tell me the truth! Who killed her?

1343
01:50:00,495 --> 01:50:02,239
Yeah go ahead sir! Kill me!

1344
01:50:03,009 --> 01:50:04,814
This is the truth whatever you do with me

1345
01:50:05,329 --> 01:50:06,782
It was her boy friend Arjun who killed her

1346
01:50:07,374 --> 01:50:10,992
As I was escaping after stealing 
the money, I saw Arjun at her home

made by a young man called Arjun'

1351
01:50:33,038 --> 01:50:34,385
Track this number immediately

I need his address and details

1353
01:50:37,063 --> 01:50:38,129
That's not needed sir

1354
01:50:38,329 --> 01:50:40,994
He was the first person we 
interrogated in this case sir

1355
01:50:41,226 --> 01:50:42,800
-Did we interrogate him? 
-Yes sir!

1356
01:50:43,212 --> 01:50:46,352
We took his fingerprints and sent him as 
we didn't have any evidence against him

1357
01:50:47,156 --> 01:50:51,797
Sir! The fingerprints in the forensic 
reports match with the ones we have!

1358
01:51:00,041 --> 01:51:01,046
Damn it!

1359
01:51:02,050 --> 01:51:03,419
Both the finger prints match!

1360
01:51:04,070 --> 01:51:05,911
How could we miss this 
clue all these days?

1361
01:51:06,777 --> 01:51:08,047
Let's hurry up... move!

1362
01:51:08,247 --> 01:51:10,768
We've got to nab him before 
he realises we know the truth

1363
01:51:10,982 --> 01:51:12,097
-Come on, move! 
-Yes sir

1364
01:51:55,187 --> 01:51:56,257

Just because you are with the cops, 
you think you escaped my wrath?

01:52:31,587 --> 01:52:35,582
You've made me an orphan 
again by killing Sanjana

[groans in pain]

1372
01:52:52,703 --> 01:52:55,999
He doesn't have a tattoo on his hand, 
so he isn't the one I'm looking for

1373
01:52:56,860 --> 01:52:57,872
Who's he then?

Arjun, just take it easy

Relax... you have to help me

1377

What help could a common 
man be of to cops sir

1378
01:53:24,561 --> 01:53:26,350
I'll ask you some simple questions

1379
01:53:27,010 --> 01:53:28,983
Just give me genuine answers. 
That's the only help

1380
01:53:30,432 --> 01:53:32,282
Did you love Sanjana?

1381
01:53:36,901 --> 01:53:38,661
Look Arjun, you should answer

1382
01:53:39,790 --> 01:53:42,490
It is very important for you 
to talk to catch the culprit

1383
01:53:42,916 --> 01:53:43,906
Please!

1384
01:53:44,983 --> 01:53:46,009
A lot!

1385
01:53:46,498 --> 01:53:48,074
I've loved her more than myself, sir

1386
01:53:49,308 --> 01:53:50,399
I'm an orphan sir

1387
01:53:51,384 --> 01:53:52,819
Does anyone love an orphan?

1388
01:53:53,515 --> 01:53:55,933
She did! She lived this orphan sir!

1389
01:53:56,460 --> 01:53:59,535
Were you present there on the 
night that she was killed?

1390
01:54:01,107 --> 01:54:03,627
I went to the boxing academy to practice

1391
01:54:03,961 --> 01:54:05,909
Well, how much time did you 
spend at the academy that day?

1392
01:54:06,329 --> 01:54:07,618
I was there till the morning sir

1393
01:54:08,472 --> 01:54:09,646
Hmm...

1394
01:54:10,917 --> 01:54:13,019
Did you speak to her on phone that day?

1395
01:54:13,866 --> 01:54:14,786
No sir

1396
01:54:14,986 --> 01:54:16,649
You say you haven't spoken to Sanjana

1397
01:54:16,919 --> 01:54:19,885
But according to the phone records, you 
spoke to Sanjana for a long time that day

1398
01:54:20,328 --> 01:54:22,234
There were 12 misses calls from your phone

1399
01:54:22,551 --> 01:54:23,577
And yeah...

1400
01:54:23,927 --> 01:54:25,429
You didn't go to the academy that day

1401
01:54:25,923 --> 01:54:27,374
The academy security 
book clearly shows that

1402
01:54:28,521 --> 01:54:29,780
Another thing is...

1403
01:54:30,153 --> 01:54:31,993
You've met Sanjana that day for sure

1404
01:54:33,275 --> 01:54:34,585
Is it you who killed Sanjana?

1405
01:54:35,813 --> 01:54:36,979
Why did you kill her?

1406
01:54:40,039 --> 01:54:41,136
[sighs]

1407
01:54:42,372 --> 01:54:43,567
Since when do you know Sanjana?

1408
01:54:47,746 --> 01:54:50,013
Why did you trap her on the 
name of love and kill her?

1409
01:54:50,353 --> 01:54:51,358
Was it for money?

1410
01:54:51,832 --> 01:54:53,272
Or have you lost interest in her?

1411
01:54:57,262 --> 01:54:58,714
You've killed another 12 girls

1412
01:54:59,455 --> 01:55:01,372
Have you trapped them in love similarly?

1413
01:55:02,405 --> 01:55:04,562
What the hell do you get by 
killing those innocent girls?

1414
01:55:06,319 --> 01:55:07,447
What are you talking sir?

1415
01:55:07,874 --> 01:55:09,121
Why would I kill the Sanjana I loved?

1416
01:55:09,467 --> 01:55:12,579
Which girls? 
You are simply trying to book cases on me

1417
01:55:12,943 --> 01:55:15,027
I've not killed anyone sir. 
I've not killed Sanjana!

1418
01:55:15,354 --> 01:55:17,155
[sighs impatiently]

1419
01:55:17,410 --> 01:55:19,864
The proofs are strong Arjun, 
you can't escape

1420
01:55:20,496 --> 01:55:23,251
I didn't even commit any 
crime to escape from it

1421
01:55:23,622 --> 01:55:25,780
We have proofs that you 
were present there that day

1422
01:55:26,389 --> 01:55:27,542
Have you killed Sanjana?

1423
01:55:27,742 --> 01:55:29,904
Or just tell me how she died. 
I'll help you

1424
01:55:30,611 --> 01:55:31,978
I don't need your help sir

1425
01:55:32,178 --> 01:55:35,616
I'll myself kill the one who killed 
Sanjana and made me an orphan again

1426
01:55:36,123 --> 01:55:38,691
This guy isn't going to open up. 
I'll make him do it

1427
01:55:41,021 --> 01:55:42,779
Don't you get it by his words?

1428
01:55:43,211 --> 01:55:45,720
He's talking about killing someone 
before the cops right in the station

1429
01:55:46,241 --> 01:55:49,489
He is for sure the 
serial killer we are looking for

1430
01:55:50,313 --> 01:55:51,686
Inspector! Inspector stop it!

1431
01:55:51,961 --> 01:55:53,300
Please! I'm talking to him!

1432
01:55:56,140 --> 01:55:58,809
Hitting me is easy sir... 
try catching the murderer

1433
01:56:00,333 --> 01:56:02,266
Look Arjun, 
I'm asking you for one last time

1434
01:56:02,466 --> 01:56:03,903
It's very important 
that you tell the truth

1435
01:56:04,477 --> 01:56:06,851
Otherwise, all the proofs that we 
have point you out as the culprit

1436
01:56:07,162 --> 01:56:08,860
You would go to jail and 
the case would be closed

1437
01:56:09,176 --> 01:56:12,826
If at all you are innocent, 
would Sanjana's soul rest in peace?

1438
01:56:15,120 --> 01:56:16,385
The real killer would actually escape.

1439
01:56:17,542 --> 01:56:22,776
And because of you, another girl 
like Sanjana would face danger

1440
01:56:23,292 --> 01:56:24,366
Think about that

1441
01:56:26,570 --> 01:56:27,647
I'll tell you sir

1442
01:56:27,847 --> 01:56:31,017
But not because you'd nab him or leave me

1443
01:56:32,569 --> 01:56:34,393
Just to prove that I've not killed Sanjana

1444
01:56:34,905 --> 01:56:36,747
And because you say another 
girl might face danger

1445
01:56:46,153 --> 01:56:49,424
I and Sanjana loved each other a lot sir

1446
01:56:51,983 --> 01:56:53,313
We wanted to marry each other too

1447
01:56:57,070 --> 01:56:58,082
That day...

1448
01:56:58,599 --> 01:57:00,024
Good morning Mr. Boxer!

1449
01:57:00,922 --> 01:57:02,871
Stop over acting and come to the point

1450
01:57:03,098 --> 01:57:05,109
-Why did you call me here? 
-I just wanted to see you!

1451
01:57:05,309 --> 01:57:06,850
Easy... don't be kidding

1453
01:57:08,282 --> 01:57:09,396

1454

Close your eyes!

1455
01:57:10,982 --> 01:57:12,331

1456
01:57:12,892 --> 01:57:14,092
Good boy! [chuckles]

1457
01:57:18,064 --> 01:57:19,104

1458

Open your eyes now

1459
01:57:22,940 --> 01:57:23,883
This is for you!

1460
01:57:24,083 --> 01:57:25,614
Hey! What's this now?

1461
01:57:26,238 --> 01:57:28,948
Come to my home in the evening 
wearing this new pair of dress

1462
01:57:29,702 --> 01:57:30,776
I'm throwing a party

1463
01:57:33,066 --> 01:57:35,477
Just for you, you know!

1464
01:57:37,919 --> 01:57:39,069
Just for me?

1465
01:57:40,102 --> 01:57:41,223
Don't miss it!

1466
01:57:41,694 --> 01:57:43,431
Hey! What's special about today?

1467
01:57:43,803 --> 01:57:44,835

01:58:21,684 --> 01:58:23,951
I always stayed far away from it

1472
01:58:25,545 --> 01:58:29,099
I always was irritated 
with you being behind me

1473
01:58:29,957 --> 01:58:31,910
But you've made me fall for your love

1474
01:58:32,701 --> 01:58:37,989
I never expected someone who would 
love me so much to enter my life

1475
01:58:39,082 --> 01:58:44,867
I want to gift something to you, who 
knows nothing other than giving in love.

1476
01:58:45,532 --> 01:58:47,933
Arjun, 
do you know what I'm going to gift you?

1477
01:58:49,051 --> 01:58:49,577
It's myself.

1478
01:58:50,949 --> 01:58:51,832
Didn't you get it?

1479
01:58:52,628 --> 01:58:54,745
Today, 
I'm going to gift myself to you.

1480
01:58:56,403 --> 01:58:59,701
I'll confess our love to my parents 
as soon as they come tomorrow.

1481

No one can separate us except the death.

one who has committed this murder.

Does that mean there was someone 
else in the house on that day,

1558
02:08:29,535 --> 02:08:30,477
If anyone asks,

1559
02:08:30,911 --> 02:08:33,331
tell them that he will remain in my 
custody until his appearance in the court.

1560
02:08:33,542 --> 02:08:35,256
Sir, he is a poor kid!

1561
02:08:35,456 --> 02:08:36,440
Do what I say.

1562
02:08:37,937 --> 02:08:38,661
Come.

1563
02:08:51,438 --> 02:08:54,085
Did you think that I will 
kill you in an encounter?

1564
02:08:55,711 --> 02:08:56,608
I won't do that.

1565
02:08:57,025 --> 02:09:00,156
We file the case on that psycho upon 
arresting and take him to the court.

1566
02:09:00,607 --> 02:09:02,596
But he releases on bail and survives.

1567
02:09:03,392 --> 02:09:04,587
I don't think it's a right way.

1568
02:09:06,516 --> 02:09:07,269
It's not right.

1569
02:09:07,552 --> 02:09:08,487
You should kill him.

1570
02:09:09,938 --> 02:09:12,589
You have time till morning. 
Kill him.

1572
02:09:24,088 --> 02:09:24,569
Come, sir.

1573
02:09:25,600 --> 02:09:29,198
Sir, the attack happened here while she 
was returning to her home from the office.

1574

[music mutes voice]

1575
02:09:59,750 --> 02:10:00,645
-Ravi Kiran. 
-Sir.

1576
02:10:00,899 --> 02:10:06,210
I want the CCTV footage of this ATM, 
the night before the attack on the girl.

1577
02:10:07,530 --> 02:10:10,205
Have you gone crazy? 
Why didn't you tell us despite all this?

1578
02:10:11,773 --> 02:10:14,301
Anyway, no one knows his whereabouts.

1579
02:10:15,505 --> 02:10:16,203
How would we catch him?

1580
02:10:21,159 --> 02:10:23,450
We'll get to know who is 
he upon decoding this date.

1581
02:10:24,537 --> 02:10:25,837
How can we decode the date?

1582
02:10:26,677 --> 02:10:29,521
For sure he has something 
to do with this date...

1583
02:10:29,665 --> 02:10:31,873
...as he tattooed it on his 
body to avoid forgetting it.

1584
02:10:32,365 --> 02:10:35,610
He definitely belongs to some port 
area according to this anchor symbol.

1585
02:10:35,837 --> 02:10:36,510
Here, look at this.

1586
02:10:49,023 --> 02:10:50,310
-Arjun. 
-What is it?

1587
02:10:53,561 --> 02:10:56,452
Both the anchor symbol which you've 
drawn and this one is identical.

1588
02:10:58,024 --> 02:11:00,076
And this is the real story which 
had happened in Kakinada port area.

1589
02:11:00,441 --> 02:11:01,682
His name is Kalki.

1590
02:11:02,190 --> 02:11:04,512
He was killed by the villagers,

1591
02:11:04,689 --> 02:11:06,279
as he was murdering in 
the same format as you said.

1592
02:11:06,425 --> 02:11:10,578
His son, who fled to Hyderabad in fear 
is also murdering in the same pattern.

1593
02:11:13,805 --> 02:11:15,267
Is he the killer who fled?

1594
02:11:26,401 --> 02:11:28,323
Sir, this is the ATM CCTV 
footage which you've asked for.

1595
02:11:30,014 --> 02:11:30,686
Play it.

1596
02:11:32,699 --> 02:11:33,137
Forward it.

1597
02:11:35,694 --> 02:11:36,300
Yeah, forward it.

1598
02:11:36,730 --> 02:11:37,452
Hold...

1599
02:11:38,488 --> 02:11:39,303
Please, zoom it.

1600
02:11:51,497 --> 02:11:52,051
Pause it.

1601
02:11:54,617 --> 02:11:55,387
Zoom it slightly.

1602
02:12:01,607 --> 02:12:02,161
Damn it!

1603
02:12:03,422 --> 02:12:04,678
The killer almost got caught and escaped.

1604
02:12:06,158 --> 02:12:09,593
He has cleverly planned and ensured that 
his face didn't get caught by the camera.

1605
02:12:09,741 --> 02:12:12,096
Sir, 
there is an ATM exactly opposite to it.

1606
02:12:12,176 --> 02:12:13,066
Even that ATM comes under us.

1607
02:12:13,727 --> 02:12:14,906
Good. 
Let's check that.

1608
02:12:15,960 --> 02:12:18,334
Everyone who makes a 
mistake leaves a clue.

1609
02:12:19,023 --> 02:12:21,667
We can search for his facebook 
profile if we know his name.

1610
02:12:22,157 --> 02:12:25,233
RIP means...

1611
02:12:25,959 --> 02:12:27,757
...revenge in psycho.

1612
02:12:27,932 --> 02:12:30,786
I don't know his name but 
I know his catchphrase.

1613
02:12:31,489 --> 02:12:34,476
RIP doesn't mean rest in peace.

1614
02:12:35,186 --> 02:12:36,154
It means revenge in psycho.

1615
02:12:38,558 --> 02:12:39,699
-Arjun. 
-Hmm.

1616
02:12:42,542 --> 02:12:45,050
Someone has put the tattoo which you've 
mentioned as his profile picture.

1617
02:12:45,960 --> 02:12:46,439
He is the murderer.

1618
02:12:48,782 --> 02:12:49,753
He is online now.

1619
02:12:50,425 --> 02:12:53,381
We can find out his location 
if we can trace him.

1620
02:12:53,859 --> 02:12:54,819
It doesn't take much time.

1621
02:13:08,061 --> 02:13:09,400
Now, I've sent a link to him.

1622
02:13:10,053 --> 02:13:13,131
The IP address will be 
traced out if he click this link.

1623
02:13:13,455 --> 02:13:15,464
We can find out his location with that.

1624
02:13:15,664 --> 02:13:16,773
-Yes! 
-Super, dude!

1625
02:13:29,015 --> 02:13:31,735
Pause it. 
Zoom...

1626
02:13:32,202 --> 02:13:32,695
Play it.

1627
02:13:34,849 --> 02:13:35,283
Yes!

1628
02:13:36,387 --> 02:13:38,620
Immediately take the 
screenshot of it and enlarge.

1629
02:13:38,680 --> 02:13:39,094
Okay.

1630
02:13:40,921 --> 02:13:42,524
He is idential to what Arjun has said.

1631
02:13:43,655 --> 02:13:46,603
Which means, 
he has definitely targetted her

1632
02:13:47,482 --> 02:13:49,063
and killed according to 
his plan by following her.

1633
02:13:50,238 --> 02:13:51,084
-Mr. Ravi Kiran. 
-Yes, sir.

1634
02:13:51,445 --> 02:13:55,242
I want the full details 
of the murders immediately.

1635
02:13:55,342 --> 02:13:55,797
Okay, sir.

1636
02:13:56,312 --> 02:13:57,449
Ask Sanjana's father to come here.

1637
02:13:57,731 --> 02:13:58,291
Okay, sir.

1638
02:14:24,822 --> 02:14:25,891
Hey sexy!

1639
02:14:34,772 --> 02:14:35,311
Yes!

1640
02:14:37,593 --> 02:14:38,409
Hey baby!

1641
02:14:38,651 --> 02:14:39,975
I love this fragrance.

1642
02:14:40,691 --> 02:14:41,803
-Do you love it too? 
-Who are you?

1643
02:14:42,515 --> 02:14:43,803
Why did you bring me here?

1644
02:14:44,553 --> 02:14:47,286
Tell me what do you want? 
I'll give you whatever you ask for.

1645
02:14:47,390 --> 02:14:48,232
Would you give me?

1646
02:14:49,886 --> 02:14:51,572
Would you give me 
whatever I ask for?

1647
02:14:57,261 --> 02:15:00,223
Who are you? 
Why did you bring me here?

1648
02:15:01,402 --> 02:15:04,071
Do you want to know who I am?

1649
02:15:06,634 --> 02:15:07,465
Sir.

1650
02:15:07,834 --> 02:15:08,904
Mr. Krishna Rao.

1651
02:15:10,068 --> 02:15:12,431
This is the CCTV footage when your 
daughter was attacked for the first time.

1652
02:15:12,976 --> 02:15:14,829
He didn't attack for money as you thought.

1653
02:15:15,567 --> 02:15:17,029
He followed her to kill.

1654
02:15:19,411 --> 02:15:21,734
Sir, he is Vinay.

1655
02:15:23,771 --> 02:15:25,145
He used to work in my supermarket.

1656
02:15:26,209 --> 02:15:27,925
Madam, here are the special 
corn flakes as you asked.

1657
02:15:28,025 --> 02:15:28,923
Oh, thank you.

1658
02:15:29,813 --> 02:15:31,201
Madam, take this too.

1659
02:15:31,471 --> 02:15:33,715
We can make four glasses 
of juice with just a spoon.

1660

It helps a lot when your friends 
and relatives come to your home.

1661
02:15:38,353 --> 02:15:42,156
A person like you is enough to 
turn a supermarket into a mall.

1662
02:15:42,323 --> 02:15:43,568
-I'm going to Annavaram today. 
-Okay.

1663
02:15:43,656 --> 02:15:45,613
-Take care of the store. Okay? 
-Okay, sir.

1664
02:15:46,138 --> 02:15:47,765
-Are you sure? 
-Yes, sir.

1665
02:15:48,328 --> 02:15:50,706
He is the one, sir. 
I gave him food when he was hungry.

1666
02:15:51,317 --> 02:15:53,892
I gave him a job in my 
supermarket as he was an orphan.

1667
02:15:54,276 --> 02:15:59,424
He killed my daughter and made me 
deprived of children. He is a demon, sir.

1668
02:15:59,542 --> 02:16:03,246
Sir, such people shouldn't be alive. 
Kill him...

1669
02:16:06,139 --> 02:16:08,763
So, he is the serial killer.

1670
02:16:10,430 --> 02:16:11,932
He is working in a 
supermarket in the daytime

1671
02:16:12,259 --> 02:16:13,490
and mudering the girls in the night time.

1672
02:16:15,189 --> 02:16:19,746
What could be the motive for a guy who is 
working in a supermarket to kill girls?

1673
02:16:22,381 --> 02:16:24,617
You might've seen many guys,

1674
02:16:25,613 --> 02:16:29,049
who chase beautiful girls for love.

1675
02:16:29,641 --> 02:16:35,376
I'm the kind of person who 
chases the girls for their death.

You aren't a human.

I would've killed her after raping, 
if you weren't there.

1710

I thought of raping and killing her 
while she was returning from the office.

But you came.

1712

I thought of killing her again.

No, your girl...

would be back by recognising me.

The blood is still wet.

1731
02:22:49,261 --> 02:22:51,368
Which means he has again 
attacked some other girl.

1732
02:22:54,222 --> 02:22:55,519
Let's go and see there. 
Come on.

1733
02:23:10,034 --> 02:23:10,582
Arjun.

1734
02:23:11,804 --> 02:23:14,028
You go from here and I'll 
take care of everything.

1735
02:23:14,230 --> 02:23:14,729
Come on, go.

1736
02:23:17,801 --> 02:23:18,230
Take him.

1737
02:23:22,677 --> 02:23:23,186
[gun shots]

1738
02:23:27,488 --> 02:23:29,698
The psycho killer who is 
raging sensation in the city,

1739
02:23:29,814 --> 02:23:33,357
was encountered by the cops in the 
city outskirts today in the morning.

1740
02:23:47,944 --> 02:23:48,563
Sanjana.

1741
02:23:49,801 --> 02:23:52,869
You came into my 
destination-less life like a Goddess.

1742
02:23:53,405 --> 02:23:56,931
The way I followed you, 
your association, your friendship...

1743
02:23:57,215 --> 02:24:01,409
your love, your kiss, 
the time spent with you,

1744
02:24:02,199 --> 02:24:03,421
are beautiful memories.

1745
02:24:04,346 --> 02:24:05,708
Your memories are my strength.

1746
02:24:06,703 --> 02:24:09,199
I see your smile when I close my eyes.

1747
02:24:10,001 --> 02:24:11,571
That is making me move forward.

1748
02:24:12,698 --> 02:24:14,574
I believe that your soul 
would rest in peace,

1749
02:24:14,932 --> 02:24:17,115
as I killed the man who made us apart.

1750
02:24:18,009 --> 02:24:21,569
I wanted to live with 
you in my next birth.

1751
02:24:22,845 --> 02:24:23,929
Love means living.

1752
02:24:24,505 --> 02:24:26,092
I'll survive with your memories.

1753
02:24:26,657 --> 02:24:27,875
I miss you Sanjana.

1754
02:24:29,146 --> 02:24:29,892
I miss you.

1755
02:24:44,870 --> 02:24:49,036
"I don't exist and won't return ever"

1756
02:24:49,352 --> 02:24:52,096
"and this is destiny"

1757
02:24:52,634 --> 02:24:56,360
"Once you know this truth,"

1758
02:24:56,991 --> 02:24:59,655
"your journey has to go on"
