00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,120
How's it?

00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,600
What are you guys shooting?

5
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,920
Hello, sir. Which country?

00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,440
Baagadpur.

00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:28,080
A small town on the outskirts
of the industrial city of Mujeerabad.

8
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,640
For this story, my contact
put me in touch with two reporters

9
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,360
who work for the local newspaper.

10
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,440

Guys, camera!

12
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,760
Hello.

13
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,000
My name is Bhawra Pandey.

00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,160
Civic and Crime reporter,
Mujeerabadi Zalzala.

15
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,720
I like Kim Kardashian and...

16
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,080
This is...

17
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,240
Stop gawping and say something.

18
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,800
Myself Kattanni.

19
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,880
Writer, horoscope column.

20
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:13,720
My likes, space technology,
moon, rockets, shuttles...

21
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,880
Okay, okay,
now tell us why we're here.

22
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,800
- Hindi?
- Yeah.

23
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,160
You are one smart cookie, huh!

24
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:29,400
You see Baagadpur very anti...

25
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,400
Anti...?

26
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,720
Old and anti...

27
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,000
Ahh...antique...ancient.

28
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,040
Yes, ancient.

29
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:43,800
I'll tell you about an
old tradition of Baagadpur.

30
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,800
Catch Marriage.

31
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,680
- Bride kidnapping.
- Yes.

32
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:53,520
See...it's like this...
When...

33
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,440
When...boy...

34
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,160
Can I speak in Hindi?

35
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,080
- Of course.
- So the thing is...

36
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,760
When a guy falls
in love with a girl...

37
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,000
...he can get the girl kidnapped
and then marry her.

38
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,040
Catch...marriage.

39
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,160
Let's take him to Babban's place.

40
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,160
Does he have a contract?

41
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,560
Do you want to see the catch marriage?

42
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,880
Do you want to see?

43
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,200
Yes, please.

44
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,640
Come, come.
We'll show you...

45
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,400
During the heydays...

46
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,040
...the groom would kidnap
the bride on his own.

47
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,560
But times are rough nowadays.

48
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,720
So now these are done
on contract basis.

49
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,200
- Contract?
- Contract.

50
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,040
Guniya Shakeel And Co.

51
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,680
Catch Marriage Experts.
See...

52
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,920
- How are you, grandma?
- All good, son.

53
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,040
They work around the clock.

54
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,000
Guys, is this a movie being made?

55
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,000
- Buddy, have you started dieting?
- Yes I did.

56
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,640
Don't point the camera that way.
He'll shoot you in the a**. Stop.

57
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,720
Kattanni.

58
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,120
He is the groom.

59
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,840
Facial for the special day?

60
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,000
He's congratulating you.

61
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,400
That is Pandit bhai and Riyaz bhai.

62
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,480
They do a good job.

63
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,480
Hey, Hollywood, there, not here.

64
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,200
That girl my wife...

65
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,680
To-be. Will-be?

66
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,800
Let's pray they kidnap her.

67
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,640
We're about to witness
a bride kidnapping.

68
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,680
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

69
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,800
Leave me.

70
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,320
Okay, best friend, goodbye.

71
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,120
This is how they catch
and now marriage...

72
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,200
Catch Marriage.

73
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,200
Let us keep playing.
It's a common routine.

74
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,000
Hello, they got the girl.

75
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,600
Why didn't anybody help her?

76
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,120
It's an age-old tradition that
runs through the veins of Baagadpur.

77
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,400
People say that we're
breaking the law.

78
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,720
But the law isn't above tradition.

79
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,360
It is said that India lives
in several centuries at the same time.

80
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,040
- She is here.
- Leave me.

81
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,680
Where is the camera?

82
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,520
Hi!

83
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,080
Aunty is here. Aunty is here.

84
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,840
Careful. Be gentle.

85
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,800
There you are, my child.
You must be tired.

86
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,560
Drink some water.

87
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,000
Even we'll have some water.

88
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:12,000
It's okay. We all got
married in a similar fashion.

89
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,440
It's okay.

90
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,640
Oh God!

91
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,040
You better show her, her place mom.

92
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,880
Or I'll beat the living
daylights out of her.

93
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,560
Sisters-in-laws already
got off on the wrong foot.

94
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,960
Aunty seems insecure.

95
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,640
Look at this beautiful necklace.

96
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,920
Made of pure gold. 24-carats.

97
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,000
My son's an engineer.
He earns well.

98
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,400
He'll treat you like a princess.

99
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,720
Just say Yes, dear.

Don't pinch, I won't fall asleep.

102
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,880
You can't fall asleep, son-in-law
or else the witch will show up.

103
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,320
Remember,
she has her eyes on the weddings.

104
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:10,920
If the groom falls asleep
she will steal your bride away.

105
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:18,697
Ah! So the singing and dancing
should continue through the night.

'Remember, she has her eyes
on the weddings.'

'If the groom falls asleep'
she will steal your bride away.'

111
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,080
If you have a mean friend,
life can still sail...

112
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,480
But if your girlfriend is mean,
life is hell.

113
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,720
Wow!

114
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,600
So guys today I'll tell you about

three kinds of lovers
you should stay away from.

the failing type... the farting type.

What crime reporter?

121
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,800
My newspaper is called
Mujeerabadi Zalzala.

122
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,320
Our newspaper has not reported
a single good story since last month

123
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,440
Well...it's wedding season, boss.

124

I have an inkling...

Something big is going to happen.

128

And when it does, you'll be the
first to get the breaking news, boss.

129

That's why I am going to the city.

Pick her up at 12 o'clock

00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:37,920
She's here.

183
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,200
Who?

184
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,080
Your witch...

185
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,840
I'll distract the father
while you bring the car around.

186
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,680
Then I'll get hold of the girl in
an instant, and...

187
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,680
- and jump in the car immediately...
- Stop. Stop. Get going already.

188
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,160
If she disappears in the crowd

189
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,200
the boss will beat us left,
right, and centre.

190
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,080
Let's go.

191
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,960
[sanskrit shlok chants]

192
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:20,040
[sanskrit shlok chants]

193
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,080
Star-sign?

194
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,440
Leave us alone. Let us go.

195
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,360
Come.

196
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,120
I'll leave you alone

197
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,680
but what about the one
that's stuck to you like a glue.

198
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,320
Your daughter's stars
are in serious jeopardy.

199
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,400
You behave like a Piscean.

200
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,560
Hear this...

201
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:45,520
The black hole's gravitational force is
creating severe problems for Pisceans.

202
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,200
Birds might poop on you

203
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,120
and neighbours might coup on you.

204
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,360
Need a fix?

205
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,440
Avoid shampoos

206
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:58,760
and comb your hair seven
times before leaving from home

207
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,160
and carry the comb in your pocket.

208
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,680
Do this and you will be blessed
from the stars of Milky Way...

209
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,880
...also remember, Lucky Number's 5

210
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,680
Lucky colour purple.

211
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,360
Leave us alone.

212
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,160
Don't ignore this.

213
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,480
Hear me out.

214
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,040
Take this money and leave.

215
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,160
If you squander your wealth like this

216
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,280
then what will you save
for your daughter's wedding?

217
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,640
Where the hell is Bhawra?

218
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,720
You're taking this prediction
too lightly, uncle.

219
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,000
Papa!

220
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,200
- Come on.
- Papa!

221
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,160
Leave her.

222
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,520
Come on.

223
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,440
Bring her in.

224
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,680
Rascal. Leave her.

225
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,360
- Leave my child. Leave.
- Uncle, don't abuse.

226
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,520
- Now you're behaving rudely.
- Papa!

227
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,920
- Papa!
- Bhawra, you also come.

228
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,760
Leave my child.

229
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,640
Come fast.

230
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,080
Stay back.

231
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,640
- Start the car.
- Leave me.

232
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,720
- Hurry up!
- Guys, what are you doing?

233
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,680
Mind your own business, bro.

234
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,400
Stay back!

235
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,080
Somebody stop them.

236
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,160
Speed up. Faster.

237
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,440
Take reverse.

238
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,800
Papa.

239
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,640
You took forever to show up.

240
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,560
She is strong like Dara Singh...

241
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:33,000
Bump your heads again. Or fate
would get you bitten by a black dog.

242
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,640
Oh no!

243
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,920
Use this chloroform.

244
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,200
Hurry up.

245
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,840
Give it to me.

246
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,200
Done?

247
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,920
Oh, Jesus.

248
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,600
I guess, she knows martial arts.

249
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,560
One for the fate...

250
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,800
Bhawra...

251
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,040
Boss...

252
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,560
Catch Marriage specialists

253
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,520
Bhawra Pandey and
Kattanni reporting, boss.

254
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,760
It's cancelled.

255
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,400
What's cancelled?

256
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,160
The wedding is cancelled.

257
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,800
The inspector accidentally shot the
groom's uncle while doing snake-dance.

258
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,720
Can't we ban this snake-dance
at weddings?

259
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,840
As such most things get banned here.

260
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,480
Gamchu's dad...

261
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,440
Always flirts with some aunty
while doing snake-dance.

262
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,800
Not to forget Chandrabhan...

263
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,520
Tries to slip under any
women's skirt while doing snake-dance.

264
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:55,720
Boss, you should cancel the
snake-dance, not the wedding.

265
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,320
Shut up!

266
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:02,920
Now, listen carefully.

267
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,440
The groom's uncle is dead.
The wedding stands cancelled.

268
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,680
It is postponed till his funeral.

269
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,360
Will you stop that bloody lightening?

270
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,360
Take the girl to our
wood factory in Ambiyapur.

271
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,880
Keep her there for a week.
Treat her well.

272
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,560
But boss, that place has
no TV or cellphone network.

273
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,120
We'll even miss the
next episode of Roadies.

274
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,520
And I won't be able to
do my horoscopes out there...

275
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,880
We're not staying
for a week in Ambiyapur.

276
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,040
Boss...

277
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,160
What if we abandon her
outside Sheila Cinema...

278
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,920
...and next week Pandit
and Riyaz can kidn...

279
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,120
- Hello?
- Did he hang up?

280
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,720
- Boss? Hello?
- He hung up.

281
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,280
WhatsApp him.

282
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,440
WhatsApp him now.

283
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,240
Send Pandit and Riyaz...

284
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,880
Ambiyapur.

285
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,000
Stupid uncle gets shot and
we have to go to the graveyard.

286
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,080
What is this place?

287
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,520
Please...

288
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,640
Don't fall. Don't fall.

289
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,480
Here...

290
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,800
- Sit.
- I want to go back to my father.

291
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,240
Sit here.

292
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,760
Careful.

293
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,720
Breaking news.

294
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,680
Tonight... boys peeing
in the open encounter a vampire!

295
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,920
Dracula offers Bloodiest Mary!

296
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,320
Bhawra Pandey, reporting for Zalzala.

297
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,080
How is it?

298
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,440
Go offer your boss
that Bloodiest Mary.

299
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,480
He totally embarrassed me
in front of that lady.

300
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,880
As if you have some reputation
amongst the girls...

301
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,440
I have seen your choices in women.

302
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,280
Some have ugly moles,
some even have moustaches.

303
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,000
Remember watching Avatar.

304
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,920
You fell in love with
the blue creature in it.

305
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
She was much better
than your girl in Titanic.

306
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,880
What a selfish woman.

307
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:54,160
Took the wooden plank
for herself and left Jack to drown.

308
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,720
Jack drowned in her love.

309
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,320
It's called sacrifice.

310
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,840
- Huh, sacrifice...
- Where's the omelette?

311
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Get a plate.

312
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,840
What a rubbish looking omelette

313
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,560
Do you want some
rubbish scrambled eggs?

314
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:44,840
Roohi.

315
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:05,680
Roohi...

316
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,600
Roohi, I've got dinner.

317
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,000
Do you like eggs?

318
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,400
Roohi.

319
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,240
Roohi.

320
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,480
Roohi.

321
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,080
Roohi.

322
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,240
Playing hide-n-seek with me.

323
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:12,040
Don't be scared.
It's just an omelette.

324
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,840
Roohi.

325
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,360
Roohi.

326
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:36,000
Don't do this please,
boss will mash us up.

327
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,760
Kattanni! Kattanni!

328
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,880
Kattanni! Kattanni! Kattanni!

329
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,320
Come on.

330
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,480
Where are you taking me?

331
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,880
She...

332
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,520
crawling on the wall.

333
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,800
You got scared of a lizard.

334
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,440
Not a lizard.

335
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,760
She's a ghost.
She will eat us, Kattanni.

336
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,240
Why? She doesn't like eggs?

337
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,400
I...I...did get her eggs.

338
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,760
But as I entered,
the room was empty.

339
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,480
Windows were sealed,
so darkness was plenty...

340
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,120
Just then I saw an
image of an evil entity.

341
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:57,640
Like a devilish humpty dumpty.

342
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:03,000
The plate slipped from me seeing
that monstrosity...

343
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:10,200
Seeing the ghost,
I pissed in my pants with severity...

344
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,720
- A ghost?
- Yes.

345
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,720
- The girl is a ghost?
- Yes.

346
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,800
She is.

347
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,640
- Come on, Bhawra.
- No.

348
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,800
- Come on.
- Where are you taking me?

349
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,480
She is very dangerous, Kattanni?

350
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:32,280
She will devour us.
She looked at me cross-eyed...

351
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:36,120
- What are you blabbering?
- Don't go. Kattanni. Kattanni!

352
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,520
Don't go, Kattanni.

353
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:43,360
She is very dangerous.
She looked at me cross-eyed...

354
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,880
Kattanni...

355
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,800
She will devour us.

356
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,720
On the wall...

357
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,240
- Please...
- Take a look first...

358
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,680
See...

359
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,720
Poor thing is just eating eggs.

360
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,920
And she'll devour us?

361
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,120
See, she's even scared of a cockroach.

362
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,600
Nothing happened.

363
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,680
It's just a side-effect of your brain.

364
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,080
You might be hallucinating, Bhawra.

365
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:58,400
Come, I'll give you a head massage
and you'll feel refreshed.

366
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,560
Come on.
Such a coward.

367
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,120
But...

368
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,520
Hallucination.

369
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,000
Excuse me.

370
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,080
Me?

371
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,200
Food...

372
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,680
Huh?

373
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,560
Food!

374
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,560
More?

375
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:11,360
I haven't eaten
anything since morning.

376
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,000
Please...

377
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:50,160
"Take a sneak peek of your loved one."

378
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,680
"O heart, reveal gently to her."

379
00:27:55,120 --> 00:28:00,000
"Don't tell her everything just yet"

380
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:04,440
"break it to her little by little."

381
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:09,320
"Take a sneak peek of your loved one."

382
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:14,080
"O heart, reveal gently to her."

383
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,600
Thank you.

384
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,400
Okay.

385
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:32,480
She has a lizard like body,
but her diet is like of a dinosaur.

386
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,720
The whole egg basket is over.

387
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,000
What are we going to eat?

388
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,040
We will manage, come on.

389
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,600
Any suspects?

390
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,360
We live in a joint family.

391
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,880
All of us live together.

392
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:07,080
When I reached home,
they were happy about her.

393
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,040
Happy on hearing about kidnapping?

394
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,280
Unfortunately, yes.

395
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,200
Here's another picture of her.

396
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,240
You got two daughters?

397
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,720
No.

398
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:29,160
Roohi sometimes looks like this.

399
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,680
Is this a joke?

400
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,000
What kind of a picture is this?

401
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,400
A year ago she was
supposed to get married.

402
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,880
Look...your wife is here.

403
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,640
Isn't she pretty?

404
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,760
Yes, very beautiful.

405
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,640
Do something
different for a change.

406
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,840
You can't always make
the same facial expression.

407
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,760
Come up with a different expression.

408
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,880
Last month, boss was asking...

409
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,160
...why do all corpses of
Baagadpur look familiar?

410
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,760
All the bulls in Baagadpur
look familiar too, like your boss

411
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,400
Does that mean they
are the same bulls?

412
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,160
Don't do this.

413
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,920
I'll come up with something.

414
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,360
I'll need more makeup.

415
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,840
You look more of a corpse
without the makeup.

416
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,760
Such a thankless guy you are.

417
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:56,760
Hurry up.

418
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:37,600
"You've tried the
lavish kind before"

419
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:46,720
"who gives you more tears
than joys, a wrong deal."

420
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:51,880
"If you want to fall in love"

421
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:56,720
"then fall for someone
closer to your heart."

422
00:32:56,920 --> 00:33:01,520
"The more careless you were"

423
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:05,600
"the more careful you must be."

424
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:11,160
"You don't have to
give all your love at once"

425
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:15,720
"love me in small instalments."

426
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,840
Kattanni!

427
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,640
Breaking news!

428
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:44,680
Werewolves create havoc in Mujeerabad!

429
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,320
Zombies run amok.

430
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,280
Ghost...

431
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:53,760
Zombie...International!

432
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,640
Ghost!

433
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,160
Ghost!

434
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,840
Guess, this was too
terrifying for him.

435
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,040
Come on.

436
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,520
Show me the pic.

437
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,400
- Now show me.
- Yes, boss.

438
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,520
I see...so that's the ghost's pic.

439
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,040
Lady...its a lady ghost.

440
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,040
Lady.

441
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,600
Show it to me, Kattanni.

442
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,720
Too much crossfit has
blurred my eyesight.

443
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,400
Show him.

444
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,480
Show him.

445
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,560
Well...

446
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:20,840
Boss...

447
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,560
I...I...

448
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,800
I think it's in zoom mode.

449
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,120
Is it, Bhawra?

450
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:30,600
Bravo. Now zoom out.

451
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,200
Show me where's the ghost!

452
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,840
It's in his mind, boss.

453
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:40,880
He's hallucinating about the ghost.

454
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,520
What are you blabbering, Kattanni?

455
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,760
Sorry, boss...

456
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,800
Boss... Boss... I could be
hallucinating once but not twice.

457
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:50,120
I would've clicked a clearer picture

458
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:53,000
but her reflection jumped
out of the mirror, Boss...

459
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:57,000
She glared at me like
the movie Terminator...

460
00:36:59,080 --> 00:36:59,800
Boss.

461
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,720
How could you leave her all alone?

462
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,880
Swear on your pecs, boss.
She is a ghost.

463
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:10,040
I'll pull your souls
out and put it on a leash.

464
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,720
For the last time...

465
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:21,160
...if you create any more hurdles,
I'll pull your balls out!

466
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:27,040
Hold on a minute. The boss is busy.

467
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,280
- What?
- Keep this money

468
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,480
and head straight to the wood factory.

469
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,640
- Boss...
- Let's just go, Bhawra.

470
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:37,800
No...

471
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,920
My balls are stuck.

472
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,600
Mum, will you keep doing
cardio or lift some weights too?

473
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:57,720
Lost 90 calories,
son, just five more to go.

474
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,720
Why is this happening with me?

475
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,040
Kattanni.

476
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,400
See that, post mortem of a poor deer.

477
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,240
I can see that.

478
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,520
Someone's cast a spell on you.

479
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,000
Spell?

480
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,480
I'll go give a burger to the girl.

481
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,320
Kattanni.

482
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,920
Not burger, but burgers.

483
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,240
Bhawra!

484
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,720
Bhawra, come quickly. Bhawra!

485
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:14,560
Hurry up.

486
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,640
- What happened?
- She escaped.

487
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,560
What?

488
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,520
Don't you see that? She escaped.

489
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,400
You check in the forest,
I'll look in the factory.

490
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,000
Wait...

491
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,480
Don't be over smart.

492
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,880
Me in the forest,
you in the factory...

493
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,400
What will she do in the
factory if she wants to escape?

494
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,080
Might be waiting for the rain to stop.

495
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,520
She tore through the roof and escaped,
you think rain will scare her!

496
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:48,920
Stupid.

497
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:53,000
She's showing some superpowers...

498
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,000
You are right.

499
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,800
She went through the roof.

500
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,800
No, no...

501
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,600
You're absolutely right.

502
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:11,000
But let's reverse roles.

503
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,480
I'll check in the factory
and you check in the forest.

504
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,520
Okay?

505
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,560
And don't be scared. I am there.

506
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,680
But keep shouting my name.

507
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,080
Bhawra!

508
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,320
Bhawra!

509
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,480
Kattanni!

510
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,800
Roohi!

511
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,440
Bhawra!

512
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,560
Bhawra!

513
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:31,920
Kattanni!

514
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:11,640
Wow...

515
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,040
Didn't I tell you she
will be in the factory?

516
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:17,000
I was chased by the
crows for no reason.

517
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:21,200
And you both are
playing games here.

518
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:25,280
I'll play too.

519
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:29,800
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe,
Catch a tiger by the toe.

520
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:32,280
If he hollers, let him go...

521
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,240
Tag. You're in.

522
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:42,840
Toilet.

523
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:46,520
Toi...

524
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:49,520
- Toilet?
- Yeah.

525
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:52,760
Toilet.

526
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:57,720
Toilet.

527
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:11,760
I know it now...

528
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:16,120
...your plan is to scare
Bhawra and give us the slip.

529
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:20,680
He's been scared since last night.

530
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:25,160
You must be thinking
we will harm you...

531
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,560
...wait till you find
out how kind we are...

532
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:31,800
You will be happy to know
why we 'kidnapped' you...

533
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:33,920
You get it...

534
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:37,520
Look, I can't tell you clearly...

535
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:40,840
But since you're a special case...

536
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,000
...try and solve this riddle...

537
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:47,280
Guess why we brought you here.

538
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:52,320
Bells will ring aloud...

539
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:54,320
Fireworks will soar above...

540
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:58,440
Matches are made in heaven
but what causes that match to happen?

541
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:07,160
Can you hear me?

542
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:20,360
Bells will ring aloud...

543
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:23,440
Fireworks will soar above...

544
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:26,760
Matches are made in heaven...

545
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:35,400
...but what causes
that match to happen?

546
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:39,680
Marriage!

547
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:36,320
"I am your...Superman."

548
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,640
"Superman."

549
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:44,120
"You are my...lady."

550
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:46,040
"Lady..."

551
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:51,480
"We're in love...already."

552
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:15,040
"Super...Super...Super...Superman!"

553
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:19,000
"Super...Super...Super...Superman!"

554
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Glory to Goddess!

555
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:28,400
What are you doing, Bhawra?

556
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,160
Glory to Goddess!

557
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:37,800
Glory to Goddess!

558
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:40,520
Can you see her now?

559
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:44,000
She's a Lady-Hulk.
Two in one!

560
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,680
Glory to Goddess!

561
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:50,080
Glory to Goddess!

562
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:57,080
If I hadn't arrived on time she would've
blown your candles out for good.

563
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:00,120
You said I was hallucinating.

564
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,840
You got my balls
crushed from boss too...

565
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:04,840
Now shall I unleash her on you?

566
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:07,000
Shall I?

567
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:13,000
Do you still want to take her to pee?!

568
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:21,720
Glory to Goddess!

569
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:25,760
Glory to Goddess!

570
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:32,360
Unchain her.

571
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,080
Careful.

572
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,640
It's alright. Everything's alright.

573
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:19,240
Poor thing.

574
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:21,040
Who?

575
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:23,440
Who else?

576
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:26,400
Are you blind?

577
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:30,320
Weren't you too harsh
on her in the forest?

578
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:33,280
She is a woman, after all.

579
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:37,520
She isn't a woman.

580
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:42,080
She is a vicious soul
who has possessed poor Roohi.

581
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,520
Remember, when those old ladies
would get possessed in our town...

582
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:49,840
...they used to fall
unconscious in seconds...

583
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,480
...but Roohi is gravely possessed.

584
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:00,000
She's in a lot of trouble, Kattanni.

585
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:02,760
We must do something.

586
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:07,840
Right, bro...

587
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:12,480
We must do something.

588
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:05,000
What's all this?

589
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:07,600
Breakfast...

590
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,800
Lunch, dinner.

591
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,280
But I'm a vegetarian.

592
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:16,680
Don't be so selfish.

593
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:20,080
The other one prefers
non-vegetarian food.

594
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:29,840
Abracadabra...

595
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:35,240
Abracadabra...

596
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:36,680
What are you doing?

597
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:41,440
This book has all the spells
to recall 'the other one'

598
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:45,280
The summoning spell first.

599
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:49,600
Abracadabra...

600
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,440
For what?

601
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:53,800
Introduction.

602
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:56,000
See, we both have met...

603
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,200
...but I couldn't introduce myself
to the other one...

604
00:51:58,720 --> 00:51:59,880
Please cooperate.

605
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:02,680
Abracadabra...

606
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:06,800
What is this way...
to introduce yourself?

607
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,440
Ah...ya

608
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:16,000
I too had doubts on this technique.

609
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,120
Let's try the Hollywood way.

610
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:20,000
As in Exercise of Imli.

611
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:23,640
When they hold the cross like this,
the girl transforms.

612
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:27,800
Power of Holy!

613
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:30,120
Power of Holy!

614
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:36,880
You're crying.

615
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,800
- Untie me.
- Wait, I'll untie you.

616
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:47,200
By the way, you're such a snub.

617
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:51,280
You turn into a Wonder Woman
in front of Bhawra.

618
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,400
Would he have untied you?

619
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:09,000
Why did you untie her?

620
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:17,480
Last night we
had a little trouble, so...

621
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,320
...he tied you up

622
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,080
Sorry.

623
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:23,400
No need to worry.

624
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:46,840
Paan?

625
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:48,680
Not too sweet,
not too spicy,

626
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:51,280
flavorful, dates, aniseed,
cloves, and nuts.

627
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,000
How polite?

628
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,240
Why don't you offer her booze too?

629
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,000
Offering betel leaf
to a young girl that too at breakfast.

630
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:03,680
She might get ulcers.

631
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:06,920
Look at that.

632
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:08,640
Who is he?

633
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,840
Spitting as if this is some
government office.

634
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:13,800
Come outside, I'll tell you.

635
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:15,240
- Why?
- Come out.

636
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:17,600
No spitting allowed here.

637
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:20,760
Shut up for God's sake, I'll be back.

638
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:21,760
Come.

639
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:27,240
What?

640
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:29,000
Who on earth is he?

641
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:31,120
Giving betel leaf for breakfast?

642
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:32,440
Control your tone.

643
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:35,160
The father of all exorcists...

644
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:37,120
...he is an expert witch hunter.

645
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:40,840
Open your mouth, dear.

646
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:44,120
Don't be scared.

647
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:46,640
Be brave.

648
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:50,920
Do witch hunters look like him?

649
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:53,080
What are you getting into?

650
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:54,560
How cliched are you?

651
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:56,640
Google him

652
00:54:57,320 --> 00:54:58,920
He's exorcized 135 ghosts.

653
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:01,680
And has got 250
followers on Instagram.

654
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:04,120
Chew it.

655
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:09,280
He's known for his
magical concoctions.

656
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:13,320
As soon as the paan goes in,
the possessing spirit comes out.

657
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:20,160
His paan is the solution
for Roohi's all problems.

658
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:21,440
Thanks.

659
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:24,600
What solution!

660
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:28,320
What have you done?

661
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:29,320
She has already spat it out.

662
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:33,000
No Kattanni, don't disturb him.

663
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:35,080
Dare you use that concoction?

664
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:36,880
Why are you getting in the way?

665
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,400
How could you just
spit her out like that?

666
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:41,920
Calm down, it will be all fine.

667
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,360
No!

668
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:46,840
I couldn't even meet her properly.

669
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:51,240
But she has spat her out now...

670
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:53,280
Now the other one can't come out.

671
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:57,480
What a terrible concoction!

672
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:31,080
Sorry...

673
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:44,400
"Run, run, run like a fire
in the mountain."

674
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:45,840
"Run, run, run."

675
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:47,160
"Go, go, go..."

676
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:49,480
"Run, run, run like a fire
in the mountain."

677
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:51,120
"Run, run, run."

678
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:57,400
"She will come after you...

679
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,720
"...she will eat you alive" Run away."

680
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:03,520
"- Run, run, run.
- You run away."

681
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:06,080
"- Run, run, run.
- You run away."

682
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:19,520
If you get scared of her

683
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:23,360
then who will exorcise the ghost out?

684
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:24,400
She isn't a normal ghost...

685
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:27,600
...she's a special witch,

686
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:31,440
The Mudiyapairi.
The most dangerous kind of a witch.

687
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:37,360
Great, so now you have
caste system amongst the witches too.

688
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:42,840
Run!

689
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:53,000
Kattanni, let's go.

690
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:14,160
The witch kingdom has several types...

691
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:18,400
...this one is a Mudiyapairi...

692
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:20,320
Meaning?

693
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:21,800
The one with the inverted feet...

694
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:24,920
...the most dangerous kinds...

695
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:27,000
Their only dream was to get married.

696
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:29,430
And since they couldn't...

697
00:58:29,510 --> 00:58:32,440
...they possess unmarried
young girls to fulfill their dreams.

698
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:39,160
I can exorcise ghosts,
witches, but not this kind...

699
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:42,200
Then who's an expert on this kind?

700
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:44,000
No one.

701
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:48,160
Getting this witch off
our back is next to impossible.

702
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:51,720
Same to same...

703
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:55,640
My father,
your uncle, Zuber's father...

704
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:58,160
...they all say the same about
their wives... as if they are also...

705
00:58:58,240 --> 00:58:59,360
- Witches?
- Yes.

706
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:22,000
Babaji, there must be some way
to make this witch leave Roohi.

707
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:25,560
The only way to get rid of
her is when the girl will get married.

708
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:27,800
But her wedding wont be
her wedding alone...

709
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:29,320
...it'll be Mudiyapairi's wedding too.

710
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:32,640
And once Mudiyapairi gets married,
she will never leave you.

711
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:34,680
Whose wedding? How many weddings?
What are you saying?

712
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:36,520
The full moon's upon us.

713
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:38,440
No one can save her now.

714
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:39,840
Forget about the girl
and save your own life.

715
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:41,880
- Hurry up. Quickly.
- Keys...

716
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,400
You can't find the keys!

717
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:45,200
What a bunch of idiots!

718
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:46,640
Baba...

719
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:50,200
Oh, shit!

720
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:53,640
Kattanni.

721
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:00,720
Kattanni.

722
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:03,600
Van keys?

723
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:05,000
Keys?

724
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:08,920
- Hurry up or else...
- I don't have it.

725
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:10,840
You don't...

726
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:11,880
But you had it.

727
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,000
What are you doing?

728
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:10,080
"I wish there's no clamour, but only
spells of silence all around."

729
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:18,240
"No one's in this world,
except for the two us."

730
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:26,320
"I am lost in your dreams,
what better can I do?"

731
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:31,720
"O dreamy-eyed one
do tell what's your name?"

732
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,160
Your star-sign?

733
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:39,320
You seem like a Leo
from your personality.

734
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:44,480
Why so short-tempered?

735
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:47,600
Wear a pearl

736
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:53,840
on your pinky.

737
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:01,360
Kattanni, let's go.

738
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:03,000
Glory to Goddess!

739
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,120
No one's going anywhere.

740
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:14,320
I can come anywhere.

741
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:17,000
Kattanni, please anywhere but here.

742
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:41,080
You got the keys.

743
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:42,920
I did.

744
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:46,840
I got the keys and the smileys.

745
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:54,560
Did you see how
she flashed a smile at me?

746
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:58,360
I am in love, bro.

747
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:04,840
If she loves me too,
then she will turn around.

748
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:12,160
Turn...

749
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:17,000
No.

750
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:19,080
Turn...

751
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:23,160
No.

752
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:25,280
Turn!

753
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:50,680
Kattanni.

754
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:52,640
Turn...

755
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:56,400
She is Emily Rose
and not Rose from Titanic!

756
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:57,720
Kattanni.

757
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:08,280
Now that's my space beauty.

758
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:11,720
You saw how her face was glowing?

759
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:15,160
I could see the entire
galaxy in her eyes.

760
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:16,320
And her face...

761
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,680
Her face resembled the moon.

762
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:22,440
This moon has measles
on her face.

763
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:25,000
And not everything that
has craters is the moon.

764
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:26,640
Despo...

765
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:29,000
Falling for a witch.

766
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:31,240
You've lost your mind.

767
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:36,280
A boy in love loses his peace,
sleep, health, wealth everything...

768
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:38,600
I have just lost my mind...

769
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:42,720
Now hear me out...

770
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:45,720
...this is called hallucination.

771
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:49,000
All these talks about black holes
have made you an as***le.

772
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:52,280
I see, you're not happy for me.

773
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:54,400
Happy?

774
01:04:55,360 --> 01:04:56,800
She's two people in one body.

775
01:04:57,160 --> 01:04:59,720
Your 'girlfriend' is living inside
my girlfriend's body.

776
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:01,680
How can I be happy?

777
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:02,680
Girlfriend?

778
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,800
When did she become your girlfriend?

779
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:07,960
Nonsense...and you were
trying to flee, right...

780
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:09,320
...then why did you come back?

781
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:13,680
For true love,
Kattanni, you won't understand.

782
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:15,840
I came back for true love,
why else would I come back?

783
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Wow. So one of us has to
sacrifice our true love now.

784
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:38,720
Well, this is what it has come to.

785
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:43,240
You've always supported me.

786
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:45,400
Remember,
when my father challenged me...

787
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:47,400
...to either earn ten grand
or sit at the butcher shop...

788
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:50,560
You helped me by robbing the
dowry of our friend's wedding.

789
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:54,680
Poor guy thought he never got dowry...

790
01:05:56,280 --> 01:06:03,480
The pervert deserved it,
but what a slip I gave to him...

791
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:06,720
Whenever I have been in danger...

792
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:09,360
...you, my bro,
have always protected me.

793
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:13,560
Remember when Naeem stuck
that sharp compass on the desk?

794
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:17,520
You stuck your hand between
my bum and the compass.

795
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:20,040
It left a big hole in the palm.

796
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:24,280
My palm still reeks of your bum.

797
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:34,320
People call us Jai and
Veeru from the iconic Sholay.

798
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:39,400
Veeru gave his life for Jai.

799
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:41,160
Jai did...

800
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:43,600
Jai gave his life for Veeru.

801
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:45,880
And you're sacrificing
our friendship for a girl!

802
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:49,000
Wait a second...

803
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:51,520
You were going to sacrifice...

804
01:06:52,280 --> 01:06:53,920
Me? Why would I

805
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:56,520
Yes, you...who else?

806
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:59,000
You've been sacrificing since
childhood, you cannot change now.

807
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:01,440
Don't be over sentimental...

808
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:04,360
To hell with this sacrifice...

809
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:07,840
I'm going to sacrifice
you in this forest.

810
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:09,920
Show some manners.

811
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:12,280
Bhawra!

812
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:14,880
I'm a yellow belt in Karate. Come.

813
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:18,120
Kattanni, don't. No cheating.

814
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:19,560
No stones.

815
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:22,320
You want to hit your own bro?

816
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:24,000
Hit me. Hit your bro.

817
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:27,080
- Bhawra, now you're cheating.
- Kattanni...

[Regional song]

820
01:07:58,080 --> 01:07:59,000
Wait a minute.

821
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:18,200
- You check.
- No, you check.

822
01:08:29,320 --> 01:08:30,480
It's your girlfriend.

823
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:33,640
Roohi.

824
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:35,720
Roohi.

825
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:38,720
Roohi.

826
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:42,760
Roohi.

827
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:52,000
Slowly.

828
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:55,720
Are you okay, Roohi?

829
01:08:57,440 --> 01:09:02,400
[Ringtone playing on phone]

830
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:06,240
I'll just take this call.

831
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:08,080
Wait.

832
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:12,880
Good evening, boss.

833
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:17,240
Take the girl back to Mujeerabad...

834
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,880
...dump her in some quiet
place and return to Bagadpur.

835
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:22,560
Dump her?

836
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:27,400
You mean Roohi.

837
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:30,440
The Police came all the way
to Bagadpur looking for the girl.

838
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:33,320
This can hamper business.

839
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:35,360
We won't get any more contracts.

840
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:36,640
The wedding's cancelled.

841
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:38,360
Take her back to the city.

842
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:42,280
That can't be done, boss.

843
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:44,880
Don't be square with me.

844
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:49,640
Boss, its a love triangle now...
cant help it.

845
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:53,680
Like in the film Saajan...

846
01:09:57,280 --> 01:10:01,280
I'll bring Roohi back
respectfully as my wife.

847
01:10:08,720 --> 01:10:09,680
Go to Ambiyapur.

848
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:11,240
Okay, boss.

849
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,480
So you've decided.

850
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,120
Decided what?

851
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:57,440
To leave...

852
01:10:58,440 --> 01:10:59,600
To sacrifice...

853
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:01,240
Thank you.

854
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:03,720
Duffer...

855
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:06,440
If we weren't childhood friends...

856
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:08,480
I would have surely sacrificed you.

857
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:11,600
We're leaving

858
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,200
You, me, Roohi.

859
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:14,760
What about her?

860
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:16,640
Ok, all 4 of us.

861
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:20,400
But why?

862
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:23,720
You think our Boss will let us go...

863
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:26,960
Last time he only squeezed our nuts,
this time he'll break it for good.

864
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:30,280
Oh no...I am still a virgin.
I want my nuts intact.

865
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:32,480
Let's please elope...

866
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:33,920
But we'll have to find a safe place.

867
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:36,720
And if your Godzilla wakes up,
we would be caught.

868
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:39,120
- Show some respect...
- Consider it as a promotion.

869
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,520
From lizard to Godzilla.

870
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:46,320
If even one person gets to know,
then try hiding from Boss.

871
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:50,280
I'll quickly find a safe place,
and return soon.

872
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:54,520
You take care of Roohi.

873
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:00,400
Don't untie her. Just take care.

874
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:11,560
Good morning.

01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:23,120
This...

876
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:30,760
So what if a cauliflower
isn't a flower...

877
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:34,560
...it's love and
fragrance will empower.

878
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:53,200
Sorry for keeping you tied up.

879
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:57,720
I know...

880
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:07,480
I don't mean to do what I do.

881
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:09,920
Yes...it's that...

882
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:14,680
See...

883
01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:17,440
You scratched me last night...

884
01:13:18,680 --> 01:13:20,000

01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:39,320
That T is like t for me.

891
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:41,840

with tongue twisters.

train his tongue to twist and turn.

Keep smiling.

The other one scares me,
by always screaming.

When it happens, darkness engulfs me.

898
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:26,760
What I see...is just chaos.

899
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:34,360
At home, no one even talks to me,
except for my father.

900
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:40,000
They have tried many remedies.

901
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:43,240
Some say

902
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,040
it's a kind of split personality.

903
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:54,000
While some don't have an answer...

904
01:14:57,160 --> 01:15:00,720
Don't cry, Roohi.

905
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:03,760
I miss my father.

906
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:14,520
But then I think you did
the right thing bringing me here.

907
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:23,480
At least the burden got off
from my family.

908
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:27,560
No, no, don't say such things.

909
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:37,320
Roohi...I'll get your
father and find your best cure.

910
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:38,600
Wait and watch.

911
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:43,400
I won't rest until I don't
get this other personality out of you.

912
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:45,240
Swear on this cauliflower.

913
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:56,160
You know, Roohi,
even I saw a lot of tragedy as a kid.

914
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,800
When I was in school...

915
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:11,040
Kattanni!

916
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:15,000
Don't untie her.

917
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:39,240
Gudiya for Mudiya.

918
01:16:48,840 --> 01:16:54,200
You...didn't tell me your name yet.

919
01:16:57,920 --> 01:16:59,520
Afza.

920
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:05,800
Roohi possessed by Afza.

921
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:11,040
Roohi-Afza.

922
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:26,360
Take good care of it.

923
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:28,280
She has literally raised me.

924
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:30,720
She's like a mother to me.

925
01:17:37,640 --> 01:17:40,280
Hey, don't expect a lamb for
the cost of chicken.

926
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:41,760
That's the one for you.

927
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:45,400
That?

928
01:17:45,640 --> 01:17:46,400
Yes, that.

929
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:54,720
Riddle, riddle,
a groom on horse means...

930
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:56,720
Marriage.

931
01:17:57,720 --> 01:18:00,000
Sisters-in-law pranking
their brother-in-laws mean...

932
01:18:00,680 --> 01:18:02,120
Marriage.

933
01:18:03,640 --> 01:18:07,280
Getting high and
dancing means...

934
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:10,280
Marriage.

935
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:18,000
"I don't care for an angel anymore..."

936
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:23,920
"I don't care for an angel anymore..."

937
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:28,720
"I lost my heart to a ghost."

938
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:33,000
Are you ready?

939
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:34,800
Yeah!

940
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:39,840
Are you ready?

941
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:56,480
How's your kidney now?

942
01:18:56,760 --> 01:18:58,360
Feels very good.

943
01:18:59,560 --> 01:19:01,840
Run for us. Run for us.

944
01:19:05,160 --> 01:19:07,040
Praise the lord.

945
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:08,720
Praise the lord.

946
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:11,040
Sir. Sir.

947
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:12,880
Are you ready?

948
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:14,680
Are you ready?

949
01:19:15,480 --> 01:19:16,320
Ready.

950
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:18,600
He's ready!

951
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:24,360
Cancer? Heart attack? Kidney problem.

952
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:25,560
Witch problem.

953
01:19:26,240 --> 01:19:29,600
Can you get rid of a witch?
I am ready to do anything you say.

954
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:30,800
Please, sir.

955
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:43,960
"Who cares about the
beauty and allure anymore."

956
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:47,880
"Who cares about the
beauty and allure anymore."

957
01:19:48,240 --> 01:19:52,440
"I lost my heart to a ghost."

958
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:57,000
"Ghost."

959
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:01,120
"Ghost."

960
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:04,880
"Ghost."

961
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:19,800
Hold him, son! Hold him!

962
01:20:20,280 --> 01:20:21,840
- Hey, hold his legs.
- He wont bite?

963
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:24,000
No.
Hold his legs.

964
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:25,360
What just happened?

965
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:27,200
Baba's job is to exorcise ghosts.

966
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:29,840
He has no control over
who the ghost possesses the next.

967
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
Is this some bluetooth ghost transfer?

968
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:33,520
Hey mister...

969
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:39,000
"I lost my heart to a ghost."

970
01:20:51,240 --> 01:20:52,680
You know everything.

971
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:56,000
Who labeled you as a ghost.

972
01:20:56,840 --> 01:20:58,720
You seem like an alien to me.

973
01:21:01,480 --> 01:21:03,440
I am a witch!

974
01:21:04,160 --> 01:21:06,120
Then why don't you possess me?

975
01:21:09,880 --> 01:21:11,400
Ah, feeling shy

976
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:17,400
"I've convinced myself
for the moonless night."

977
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:20,720
"I'll eagerly await."

978
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:28,600
"My love story shall form,
I'll date the queen of ghosts."

979
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:31,120
She's cured.

980
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:33,120
Glory to Swami.

981
01:21:33,320 --> 01:21:34,480
Glory to Swami.

982
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:36,520
Everyone, hear me.

983
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:38,760
Where is Swami?

984
01:21:39,240 --> 01:21:40,760
There is no Swami.

985
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,440
It's all a sham, fake stories.

986
01:21:44,120 --> 01:21:45,920
There is no such thing as a ghost.

987
01:21:46,160 --> 01:21:49,400
All this is just to scare you,
and mislead you.

988
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:51,440
She was cured by science.

989
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:52,800
Always believe in science.

990
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:54,960
Glory to Science Baba.

991
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:57,320
Glory to Science Baba.

992
01:21:57,880 --> 01:22:00,040
You'll realise when you
actually see a Mudiyapairi.

993
01:22:26,360 --> 01:22:28,120
Oh...Bull dogs...?

994
01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:34,160
So we're bulldogs now...?

995
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:38,040
And you're a cute Pomeranian.

996
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:43,720
Busy taking cute pictures here
and not reporting to the Boss?

997
01:22:44,440 --> 01:22:47,920
Boss didn't install Wi-Fi, else
I would send him a daily video report.

998
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,640
You heard their demand, Pandit?

999
01:22:52,840 --> 01:22:56,880
One wants Wi-Fi,
the other one wants a wife.

1000
01:22:57,840 --> 01:22:59,800
They underestimated us.

1001
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:05,360
Boss said, the girl's
wedding is cancelled...

1002
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:07,520
He wants you back Now!

1003
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:36,360
Roohi.

1004
01:23:38,360 --> 01:23:39,200
Kattanni.

1005
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:47,600
Roohi.

1006
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:03,600
Oh no!

1007
01:24:24,440 --> 01:24:25,400
Roohi.

1008
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:32,200
Are...you okay?

1009
01:24:33,680 --> 01:24:34,760
This...

1010
01:24:36,440 --> 01:24:39,120
it's...it's okay.

1011
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:40,840
Nothing happened!

1012
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:45,040
Kattanni.

1013
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:50,480
Are you okay?

1014
01:24:57,040 --> 01:24:58,640
We'll have to get out of here.

1015
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:01,560
Where will we go?

1016
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:04,440
There is a place.

1017
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:06,680
Chimattipur.

1018
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:32,120
Boss.

1019
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:34,200
Boss.

1020
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:49,040
Sign these papers.

1021
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:50,600
We've informed the Police.

1022
01:25:50,680 --> 01:25:52,800
They will come and
take your statement.

1023
01:25:54,640 --> 01:25:57,560
You'll be shocked to see it.

1024
01:25:57,640 --> 01:26:02,760
Both have been beaten to pulp.

1025
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:04,000
One couldn't take it

1026
01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:05,880
and the other one
fell unconscious...here

1027
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:13,120
Have you seen this girl?

1028
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:17,040
Sir, show him the other picture.

1029
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:20,520
Her?

1030
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:23,600
Where is she?

1031
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:26,160
Where is she?

1032
01:26:27,160 --> 01:26:29,160
Chimattipur.

1033
01:27:03,240 --> 01:27:11,890

Where?

1041
01:28:00,040 --> 01:28:01,040
There.

1042
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:03,480
Here.

Don't worry, I am right beside.

1051

Next door.

1052
01:30:00,240 --> 01:30:01,120

Get down.

Pandey.

1061

Pandey.

1062
01:32:34,680 --> 01:32:36,200
You traveled on the roof?

1063
01:32:36,280 --> 01:32:37,920
It was a blast, man.

1064
01:32:39,120 --> 01:32:40,200
Where is Kattanni?

1065
01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:42,040
Sleeping.

1066
01:32:42,720 --> 01:32:46,080
- I called you...urgently...
- The suit you asked for.

1067
01:32:48,040 --> 01:32:49,120
Grey colour!

1068
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:51,160
So what's the occasion?

1069
01:32:52,280 --> 01:32:53,200
Marriage.

1070
01:32:53,640 --> 01:32:54,480
Marriage?

1071
01:32:55,040 --> 01:32:58,920
You help me?
One last catch marriage.

1072
01:33:00,320 --> 01:33:02,560
- Catch marriage?
- Small one.

1073
01:33:03,880 --> 01:33:05,120
Who is getting married?

1074
01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:11,680
I met one girl. Roohi.

1075
01:33:13,280 --> 01:33:14,320
You?

1076
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:17,760
And...

1077
01:33:19,880 --> 01:33:21,080
I'll tell you.

1078
01:33:21,880 --> 01:33:22,800
Long story.

1079
01:33:29,200 --> 01:33:32,800
- Glory to...
- Swami!

1080
01:33:33,040 --> 01:33:35,160
- Glory to...
- Swami!

1081
01:33:35,240 --> 01:33:37,520
He'll know when he
runs into a Mudiyapairi.

1082
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:40,520
- Glory to...
- Swami!

1083
01:33:40,720 --> 01:33:43,680
- Glory to...
- Swami!

1084
01:33:55,720 --> 01:33:57,320
Only 200?

1085
01:33:57,480 --> 01:33:59,360
How much more prepaid do you need?

1086
01:34:01,240 --> 01:34:02,400
One more.

1087
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:05,320
Even the cougars don't
ask for so much of recharge.

1088
01:34:07,520 --> 01:34:09,800
Are we good now or you
want the latest iPhone too?

1089
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:16,920
The only solution is to get
the witch married...

1090
01:34:17,400 --> 01:34:22,240
...but then this wedding will be
of both - the girl and the witch.

1091
01:34:23,080 --> 01:34:24,520
Again, the wedding...

1092
01:34:25,880 --> 01:34:29,680
Back there you showed me the
overconfidence of Trump and here

1093
01:34:30,520 --> 01:34:31,640
you don't even have
a proper solution...

1094
01:34:31,720 --> 01:34:35,920
This is not an election,
so don't expect results so easily.

1095
01:34:36,520 --> 01:34:39,040
Do you know what kind of
a witch, Mudiyapairi is?

1096
01:34:39,760 --> 01:34:42,640
Do you know what a
Full Blue Moon does to her?

1097
01:34:45,600 --> 01:34:47,440
Full Blue Moon?

1098
01:34:48,400 --> 01:34:50,240
That bloody exorcist
also said the same...

1099
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:56,313
When the most auspicious
constellation...

1100
01:34:56,393 --> 01:34:59,840
...and the Full Blue
Moon come together...

1101
01:35:00,600 --> 01:35:03,240
...this group of witches
set out on a hunt.

1102
01:35:03,640 --> 01:35:08,720
If they see the groom is sleeping the
witch possesses the body of the bride...

1103
01:35:09,480 --> 01:35:11,892
...then she has to get married...

1104
01:35:11,972 --> 01:35:15,480
...within a year before
the Full Blue Moon appears again.

1105
01:35:16,280 --> 01:35:17,760
And what if she can't get
married within a year?

1106
01:35:20,600 --> 01:35:21,640
Death.

1107
01:35:23,360 --> 01:35:25,560
Both for the witch and the girl.

1108
01:35:34,120 --> 01:35:39,240
What kind of horror story are you
making up, tell me what's the solution.

1109
01:35:39,480 --> 01:35:41,080
Tell me what to do.

1110
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:45,760
Faux wedding.

1111
01:35:46,640 --> 01:35:47,520
What?

1112
01:35:47,760 --> 01:35:50,240
Faux wedding with the girl.

1113
01:35:51,200 --> 01:35:58,520
The witch is only focused on
her only desire to get married.

1114
01:35:59,080 --> 01:36:01,880
This witch just wants
to be someone's wife.

1115
01:36:02,600 --> 01:36:09,040
But what if the guy, she marries,
is already married to someone else?

1116
01:36:11,240 --> 01:36:12,040
Then?

1117
01:36:12,280 --> 01:36:15,160
Then the witch won't be his wife...

1118
01:36:15,560 --> 01:36:17,280
She will be his mistress.

1119
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:21,840
And a witch will never
agree to be someone's mistress.

1120
01:36:22,440 --> 01:36:25,680
She will immediately forsake
the body of the mistress.

1121
01:36:27,120 --> 01:36:29,400
Oh, so if I marry
someone else first...

1122
01:36:30,040 --> 01:36:33,320
...and later marry Roohi, then
the witch will quit her body? Wow.

1123
01:36:33,480 --> 01:36:35,480
That's perfect then.

1124
01:36:35,640 --> 01:36:37,000
There is a risk involved.

1125
01:36:37,720 --> 01:36:38,440
Risk?

1126
01:36:39,040 --> 01:36:41,040
The witch might get furious.

1127
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:45,560
And she might attack in a fit of rage.

1128
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:50,800
This rage can harm the girl,
or her husband...

1129
01:36:51,920 --> 01:36:54,560
...or both.

1130
01:36:55,360 --> 01:36:58,480
Come on, isn't there some kind
of assurance of the plan working?

1131
01:36:59,160 --> 01:37:01,640
How can an old woman like me
give assurance?

1132
01:37:02,160 --> 01:37:03,800
It all depends on her mood.

1133
01:37:04,520 --> 01:37:07,000
You can take the risk
of getting married...

1134
01:37:07,200 --> 01:37:13,400
But we must find a girl
who has lost her will to live...

1135
01:37:17,640 --> 01:37:18,760
Got it?

1136
01:37:22,080 --> 01:37:23,640
Understood?

1137
01:37:30,640 --> 01:37:31,440
I understood.

1138
01:37:38,160 --> 01:37:39,080
I accept.

1139
01:37:40,560 --> 01:37:41,680
Accept what?

1140
01:37:42,800 --> 01:37:47,040
When you're prepared to risk your life,
then even I am ready to marry you.

1141
01:37:47,240 --> 01:37:49,280
But only marriage, no hanky-panky.

1142
01:37:49,800 --> 01:37:51,760
Why would I risk my life for you?

1143
01:37:52,200 --> 01:37:55,080
I am offering you a solution, and
you're offering me as the sacrifice?

1144
01:37:55,240 --> 01:37:56,800
Then its hardly a solution...

1145
01:37:57,520 --> 01:37:59,360
You made it sound like
you are some James Bond...

1146
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:01,120
...and now throwing me under the bus?

1147
01:38:03,680 --> 01:38:05,080
You also got to take some risk.

1148
01:38:05,400 --> 01:38:07,000
Why should I risk?

1149
01:38:07,680 --> 01:38:10,720
Its my age to enjoy and have fun
and you want me to sacrifice for you?

1150
01:38:10,920 --> 01:38:12,720
Be practical, you don't have
much time left anyway...

1151
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:14,600
...put it to someone's use.

1152
01:38:16,440 --> 01:38:18,760
Life's so short already,
and you wasted my time.

1153
01:38:18,840 --> 01:38:21,240
What a thankless idiot you are...

1154
01:38:31,880 --> 01:38:32,840
What?

1155
01:38:32,920 --> 01:38:35,120
You wont get a more
handsome husband than me...

1156
01:38:35,200 --> 01:38:36,160
...marry me.

1157
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:37,760
Marry me.

1158
01:38:39,080 --> 01:38:41,600
Even my dog wouldn't marry you.

1159
01:38:41,680 --> 01:38:43,520
I am asking you, not your dog.

1160
01:38:43,800 --> 01:38:46,000
What a wild one you are.

1161
01:38:49,400 --> 01:38:50,600
Wait a second.

1162
01:38:51,360 --> 01:38:52,720
When Manish had trouble
with his stars...

1163
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,040
...he got married to a
dog first to trick them.

1164
01:38:55,600 --> 01:38:59,040
If we can trick the stars,
then we can trick the witch too.

1165
01:38:59,400 --> 01:39:01,280
This is not some game...

1166
01:39:06,080 --> 01:39:09,160
Aunty...how about
I marry a dog...and...

1167
01:39:12,840 --> 01:39:14,920
Forget it.
Not a good idea.

1168
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:19,800
Mind blowing idea!

1169
01:39:22,920 --> 01:39:26,000
Must appreciate your
wild brain, but listen...

1170
01:39:27,080 --> 01:39:30,560
...the wedding will have
to be with proper customs.

1171
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:32,200
Nothing fake.

1172
01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:33,240
Okay.

1173
01:39:34,680 --> 01:39:36,200
Then find me a good dog.

1174
01:39:38,200 --> 01:39:41,120
Wait, how do you know all this?

1175
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,480
What? You're getting too frank now...

1176
01:39:53,440 --> 01:39:55,160
It's been 40-years...

1177
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:59,880
...but my feet are still
not completely straight.

1178
01:40:02,360 --> 01:40:04,160
Faux wedding.

1179
01:40:08,280 --> 01:40:09,800
And your husband.

1180
01:40:13,120 --> 01:40:15,400
Even your life's in danger, son.

1181
01:40:18,720 --> 01:40:21,040
There is a place...Chimattipur.

1182
01:40:22,360 --> 01:40:26,280
Across its river,
there's a pious place for dogs...

1183
01:40:26,480 --> 01:40:28,440
...that's where you can get married.

1184
01:40:33,560 --> 01:40:36,880
It's a different kind of
wedding you're talking about.

1185
01:40:41,480 --> 01:40:44,160
Anything for my Roohi.

1186
01:40:46,840 --> 01:40:48,240
And you'll let me shoot it?

1187
01:41:09,200 --> 01:41:10,000
Let's go.

1188
01:41:10,680 --> 01:41:11,640

Someplace better than this.

1192
01:41:18,520 --> 01:41:20,120
Where is Bhawra?

1193
01:41:20,360 --> 01:41:21,880
Do you have a problem with me?

1194
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:25,000
No, I don't have a problem with you.

1195
01:41:25,080 --> 01:41:28,120
He's just...more responsible.

1196
01:41:28,880 --> 01:41:30,000
You call him responsible?

1197
01:41:30,400 --> 01:41:32,200
Don't let his innocent face fool you.

1198
01:41:32,280 --> 01:41:35,520
He's the Casanova of old aunties
and you think he's responsible.

1199
01:41:36,440 --> 01:41:39,240
Look...your stars are in disarray.

It often affects the mind.

1201
01:41:42,280 --> 01:41:45,360
Don't worry,
I am friendlier than him.

1202
01:41:45,800 --> 01:41:49,920
Listen...please...go away.

1203
01:41:50,680 --> 01:41:55,480
I am already in a
lot of trouble and...

1204
01:41:58,160 --> 01:42:00,280
...I understand what
you two are up to.

1205
01:42:00,760 --> 01:42:02,880
But I won't let this wedding happen.

1206
01:42:05,240 --> 01:42:06,400

1207
01:42:06,480 --> 01:42:07,760

I see...

1210
01:42:12,240 --> 01:42:14,760
Why else has he got a tuxedo?

1211
01:42:17,040 --> 01:42:20,280
He can't marry without my permission.

1212
01:42:20,560 --> 01:42:22,160
Of course he can.

1213
01:42:22,240 --> 01:42:23,720
That's how we do it.

1214
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:25,640
And what you're doing isn't right...

1215
01:42:26,040 --> 01:42:28,080
There is someone else inside you...

1216
01:42:28,160 --> 01:42:30,000
...and she too has desires.

1217
01:42:31,360 --> 01:42:34,080

American as his best man...
