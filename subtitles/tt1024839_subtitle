Song voice came out
of his room at night.

109
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:43,770
Who is she?

110
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:51,714
Abhi is very good by heart
but useless in matter of love.

111
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:07,271
Really, l'm not aware of it.

112
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:16,337
l tell you. According to Chiterkot,
there is too much negativity in you.

113
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:23,545
- lt needs a bit of cleansing.
- Okay.

114
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:33,689
- To whom she's talking?
- Talking to her best friend.

115
00:15:34,366 --> 00:15:35,833
What's the matter, can't
stay quiet for a while?

116
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:41,401
- ls he imaginary.
- Off course not.

00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:47,903
Then why l'm unable to see him?

00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:50,777
Pagloo l can't see him!

119
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:53,173

121
00:15:58,857 --> 00:16:02,027
- ls she talking to ghost?
- No.

122
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:04,330
Pagloo didn't mean to
say this. He's silly.

123
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:07,366
What? She just called me silly.

124
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:11,234
Not me, Chiterkot.
Chiterkot that's really bad.

125
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:13,166
- Don't say such like that.
- What?

126
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:16,041
- What he's saying about myself?
- No... No... Nothing.

127
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:18,110
- What nothing? At least he's saying something.
- No... No... Chiterkot.

128
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:20,101
Chiterkot l'll not
say anything like this.

129
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:23,349
- Say it to me.
- No... No... No... l'll not say.

130
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:27,486
lf you are brave then come and face me. Talk to
me directly. Direct to me. Man to man come on.

131
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:28,919
Oh, just shut up both of you!

132
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:36,386
Too much negativity has
broadened in this room.

133
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:41,464
We'll do chanting for a while.

134

00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:32,661
- Chiterkot.
- Yes.

170
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:36,275
When l said that l feel mom all
the time then you don't have any

171
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:39,802
problem. When Sara says that she
feels Chiterkot then you have problem.

172
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:41,947
Salsify.

173
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:45,849
Yes now speak, will you stay like a priest
for the rest of your life without sex?

174
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:49,188
Guys l'm telling you she's the one.

175
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:53,124
Dear she's not the one. She's No. 31.

176
00:19:56,361 --> 00:20:02,467
Abhi age is 26 and till now he has 31
girlfriends. He fall in true love with every

177
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:09,373
girlfriend and we believe that Abhi's taste is
a bit off. Actually it a bit high than little.

178
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:15,544
l write a poem for you.

179
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:23,411
When we went on a romantic walk.
l got feeling due to a shock.

180
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:25,821
Like we found our first love.

181
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:29,353
Because after meeting
you, nobody else be mine.

182
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:34,594
Because that's you...
that's you... that's you.

183
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:37,401
How's it?

184
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:45,671
Not good.

185
00:20:46,845 --> 00:20:48,870
Okay, l'll try again.

186
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:54,812
Abhi always see inside beauty.

187
00:21:04,062 --> 00:21:06,826
l wish that he pay a bit of
his attention on packaging.

188
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:52,137
Change yourself otherwise
you'll end up like this.

189
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:55,409
Like him.

190
00:22:04,556 --> 00:22:09,050
- What happen?
- What else would be? Again his heart has broken.

191
00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:10,520
Shut up Pagloo!

192
00:22:12,564 --> 00:22:15,499
- She's gone.
- But why?

193
00:22:17,035 --> 00:22:20,493
- Alone l want to spent time with her.
- So.

194
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:27,546
Chiterkot fell angry. He
gave Sara a choice, me or him.

195
00:22:27,546 --> 00:22:29,878
Shut up Abhi! Listen yourself.

196
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:35,346
lt's a daily drama. Whatever girl
you found you become like her.

197
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:42,158
Love can change yourself then it's okay. You
don't have to change yourself to get love.

198
00:22:47,966 --> 00:22:50,366
Listen Abhi what's the hurry?

199
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:55,435
She'll come and when she come
you'll not have to change yourself.

200
00:22:56,174 --> 00:22:59,575
Because she'll be perfect
for you and you for her.

201
00:23:17,763 --> 00:23:20,664
- Ammo, shall l ask one thing?
- Ask.

202
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:25,598
lf you'll have to chose a girl for Abhi
then what kind of girl you choose for him?

203
00:23:25,837 --> 00:23:28,738
Why? Do you want to
put him on Shaadi.com?

204
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:33,612

212
00:23:59,738 --> 00:24:04,943
Seriously Ammo think, there is no need
to change Abhi and your love change Abhi.

213
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:07,679
Abhi is only my friend.
We are just friend okay.

214
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,842
Ammo lf Abhi love you then?

215
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:16,043
He'll not do anything like this and if he'll
do then l'll straighten by slapping him.

216
00:24:20,592 --> 00:24:22,961
Okay what kind of boy you like?

217
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:25,191

Both of you are best friends. Why

225
00:25:00,265 --> 00:25:05,168
- Marry him uncle, he'll be responsible.
- Who'll marry him? You tell me.

You have to stop doing this.

00:25:40,805 --> 00:25:43,137
- Uncle is looking for you.
- Don't tell him l'm here.

235
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,971

No Abhi, this time things

lt's really important.

339
00:39:48,586 --> 00:39:50,621
Stop doing drama. Stay for a while Ammo.

340
00:39:50,621 --> 00:39:55,718
Come on Abhishake if she's saying that it's
an important meeting then allow her to leave.

341
00:39:57,228 --> 00:40:00,720
l know the importance of job for
our kind of self-respected girls.

342
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:06,537
lt's nice to meet you

343
00:40:06,537 --> 00:40:09,631

345
00:40:13,277 --> 00:40:15,177

Little bit more perfect she is

349
00:40:33,798 --> 00:40:37,067
Amrita you are all that what Abi told

350
00:40:37,067 --> 00:40:39,069
Amrita you used to work ?

351
00:40:39,069 --> 00:40:42,004
How conscious
-How irritating

352
00:40:43,073 --> 00:40:44,870
You and Abi must be together

353
00:40:46,477 --> 00:40:48,001
That's all your fault

354
00:40:48,479 --> 00:40:49,113
Mine ?

355
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:53,050
That's all rough talking
Abi was only Abi for me

356
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:56,153
Now Abi is that guy who break my heart

357
00:40:56,153 --> 00:40:58,815
And not his mistake
because he did not know

358
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:01,692

359

That was our eighth standard last
day l don't know how we have passed

369
00:41:42,433 --> 00:41:43,798
Every day used to see one movie

Who wrote this Ammo is a boy?

375
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:06,190
Actually first time when
we meet Amoo then for

376
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:09,353
six month we don't know
that Ammo is a boy or girl

Gabrools Abi grow up
-No body could grew up in two days

386
00:42:51,035 --> 00:42:53,404
lf your all girlfriends
name could be written there

387
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:55,531
then there would not be
place for us -Relax guys

388
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,332
lt's ok Abishek

389
00:42:57,942 --> 00:43:01,070
Take it l don't want to

390
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:08,277
Wait for some days then one day these all

Yes

406
00:43:46,357 --> 00:43:48,192
Then why you accept
your defeat so early?

407
00:43:48,192 --> 00:43:53,755
lt's not but make it try
it could be yes by chance

408
00:43:59,036 --> 00:44:03,632
Step one Abi should have
remembrance that Ammo is not a boy

409
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:10,710
Where is Amoo?

410

You know what l mean?

864
01:44:10,577 --> 01:44:14,741
l have to leave but don't forget.

865
01:44:30,664 --> 01:44:33,292
And if you will find more tapes like
that then you must show me.

866
01:44:33,433 --> 01:44:36,869
l'll make and bring them,
OK! Bye!

867
01:46:05,359 --> 01:46:06,826
l thought l heard Kartika's voice.

868
01:46:08,562 --> 01:46:10,120
Your kartika's ghost didn't go yet.

869
01:46:11,898 --> 01:46:13,126
Forget it, Yesterday Amu has come.

870
01:46:14,334 --> 01:46:17,201
She made a video on my all
ex-girlfriends.

871
01:46:18,305 --> 01:46:21,797
Comedy show,
Suppose it then we went for coffee.

872
01:46:23,176 --> 01:46:27,203
Then?
No Man, Since l'm thinking about Amu.

873
01:46:27,914 --> 01:46:29,779
OK!
l mean

874
01:46:30,283 --> 01:46:33,081
l should think about Kartika.
Not at all.

875
01:46:33,387 --> 01:46:37,016
Where is she? What she's doing?
Who? Kartika?

876
01:46:37,691 --> 01:46:38,623
No!
Amu!

877
01:46:56,576 --> 01:46:58,271
Do you know, Amu loved someone.

878
01:46:59,546 --> 01:47:02,276
Whom?
She didn't told me,

879
01:47:04,151 --> 01:47:05,482
May be possible she loved me.

880
01:47:07,721 --> 01:47:09,916
Are you mad?
Or with you?

881
01:47:12,626 --> 01:47:16,426
But why you're showing so interest?
That's the problem.

882
01:47:17,564 --> 01:47:19,828
l think about her everytime,
What?

883
01:47:25,372 --> 01:47:27,169
lt's her life, She lives on her way.

884
01:47:33,947 --> 01:47:35,414
l still miss Kartika,
What?

885
01:47:36,216 --> 01:47:38,707
l mean, l think l should miss her.

886
01:47:41,555 --> 01:47:42,112
Confused?

887
01:47:45,459 --> 01:47:46,084
Yes!

888
01:47:51,498 --> 01:47:54,797
Call Amu on a romantice dinner,
Spend your entire evening with her,

889
01:47:55,802 --> 01:47:59,932
lf you think once about Kartika,
Then Kartika and if not

890
01:48:00,807 --> 01:48:01,239
then Amu.

891
01:49:50,250 --> 01:49:51,114
Tell you something?

892
01:49:52,285 --> 01:49:52,649
What?

893
01:49:56,690 --> 01:49:57,281
Why?

894
01:49:58,525 --> 01:50:00,390
l came dressed up so much.

895
01:50:03,463 --> 01:50:04,259
Tell you something?

896
01:50:05,165 --> 01:50:05,563
What?

897
01:50:09,669 --> 01:50:11,261
You came dressed up so much.

898
01:50:18,445 --> 01:50:19,742
You're the only girl.

899
01:50:20,213 --> 01:50:22,010
With whom l can sit for hours alone.

900
01:50:22,248 --> 01:50:23,681
Without saying anything,
Without this fear...

901
01:50:24,351 --> 01:50:25,545
...that you'll get bored of me.

902
01:50:25,719 --> 01:50:26,777
or l'll get bored of you.

903
01:50:28,855 --> 01:50:30,186
You're getting mature, Abhi.

904
01:50:31,358 --> 01:50:32,950
32 relationships.

905
01:50:33,360 --> 01:50:35,726
not after 33 relationships then when?

906
01:50:46,006 --> 01:50:47,371
What was his name?

907
01:50:49,075 --> 01:50:51,305
That fool who broke your heart.

908
01:50:54,180 --> 01:50:55,442
lt wasn't his fault.

909
01:50:57,484 --> 01:50:58,712
Then why did he left you?

910
01:50:59,753 --> 01:51:00,720
He didn't.

911
01:51:03,123 --> 01:51:03,851
Then...

912
01:51:06,359 --> 01:51:07,587
l didn't tell him.

913
01:51:08,061 --> 01:51:08,652
Why?

914
01:51:10,764 --> 01:51:11,492
Another girl?

915
01:51:14,901 --> 01:51:15,526
And you.

916
01:51:17,871 --> 01:51:19,634
Should l greive all my life?

917
01:51:20,306 --> 01:51:23,298
l have you, Paglu.
l have mom.

918
01:51:23,710 --> 01:51:25,302
l have your dad.
l have office.

919
01:51:25,879 --> 01:51:27,972
Life gives us so much.

920
01:51:28,348 --> 01:51:30,942
And we just sit around with our eyes closed
for something so little.

921
01:51:35,789 --> 01:51:36,346
What?

922
01:51:37,590 --> 01:51:39,490
There's so much to learn from you.

923
01:51:41,695 --> 01:51:42,218
Tell me.

924
01:51:42,629 --> 01:51:43,823
What?
His name.

925
01:51:44,864 --> 01:51:45,296
No

926
01:51:46,066 --> 01:51:47,192
Where did you meet him?

927
01:51:47,767 --> 01:51:49,064
You just have two guys in your life.

928
01:51:49,736 --> 01:51:50,430
ls is Paglu?

929
01:51:53,673 --> 01:51:54,139
No

930
01:52:11,858 --> 01:52:12,847
l should go now.

931
01:52:13,626 --> 01:52:14,388
Don't go.

932
01:52:16,596 --> 01:52:17,426
Please don't go.

933
01:52:19,099 --> 01:52:20,361
Amu, l'll become like Sunil.

934
01:52:20,700 --> 01:52:22,759
Anjali don't go.
Please don't go Anjali.

935
01:52:33,880 --> 01:52:36,781
Amu, l was just kidding.
l'm not going to become Sunil for real.

936
01:52:42,288 --> 01:52:43,118
Paglu

937
01:52:59,439 --> 01:53:01,339
This is Anjali,
Sunil's Anjali.

938
01:53:01,508 --> 01:53:04,033
Remember the way he was holding
and begging.

939
01:53:04,210 --> 01:53:07,304
Don't leave me Anjali.
He has never called anyone Anjali.

940
01:53:09,115 --> 01:53:10,446
Why didn't l think of this!?

941
01:53:15,155 --> 01:53:17,385
By the way she listens with her ears
not mouth.

942
01:53:27,066 --> 01:53:28,033
Where is Sunil?

943
01:53:28,434 --> 01:53:29,366
He don't come here, nowadays.

944
01:53:29,803 --> 01:53:31,270
But he used to come every evening.

945
01:53:31,905 --> 01:53:34,533
Now he goes to his support group
every evening.

946
01:53:58,965 --> 01:53:59,932
New member?

947
01:54:00,333 --> 01:54:01,095
Member!

948
01:54:03,136 --> 01:54:06,128
Alchaholic Support Group!
How long have you been addicted?

949
01:54:06,506 --> 01:54:07,097
What?

950
01:54:07,407 --> 01:54:10,171
Liquor.
No, No. Don't be shy.

951
01:54:10,476 --> 01:54:13,673
l had the addiction of 5 years but
l quit after coming here.

952
01:54:15,615 --> 01:54:17,412
lf l have a drinking problem.

953
01:54:18,084 --> 01:54:19,108
Then l can go inside.

954
01:54:20,820 --> 01:54:22,481
Then l have a very serious drinking
problem.

955
01:54:22,989 --> 01:54:24,581
l go to sleep with a bottle.

956
01:54:25,024 --> 01:54:26,787
and l wake with another bottle.

957
01:54:27,227 --> 01:54:31,960
When the bottle is with me,
there's no sorrow, no tears in life.

958
01:54:32,532 --> 01:54:34,693
And when those golden drink goes
throught my throat.

959
01:54:35,501 --> 01:54:37,799
it feels like a new sun is rising in
the evening.

960
01:54:43,376 --> 01:54:44,707
Where are you going?

961
01:54:45,478 --> 01:54:47,673
l want to see the sun rise of the
evening.

962
01:54:49,816 --> 01:54:51,215
Everyone was drinking over there.

963
01:54:51,651 --> 01:54:54,950
l thought nothing will happen if
l take sip.

964
01:54:56,422 --> 01:54:57,787
l even went to the bar.

965
01:54:58,391 --> 01:55:02,885
But then l remembered your support
and love.

966
01:55:03,363 --> 01:55:04,591
And l didn't drink.

967
01:55:18,044 --> 01:55:18,806
And now...

968
01:55:19,245 --> 01:55:22,874
l'll call our newest member,
Mr. Gurudev.

969
01:55:34,928 --> 01:55:35,986
My name is Paresh.

970
01:55:37,997 --> 01:55:39,157
And l'm an alchaholic.

971
01:55:42,936 --> 01:55:44,733
lt's good that nobody came here
drunk.

972
01:55:45,438 --> 01:55:48,236
lt would've been difficult saying hi
together at once.

973
01:55:55,281 --> 01:55:57,272
l used to think that alchaholic
support group.

974
01:55:57,583 --> 01:56:01,178
ls a group where people support
eachother to drink.

975
01:56:10,163 --> 01:56:12,791
lt's hard for the first timers.
Try.

976
01:56:17,570 --> 01:56:19,936
My name is Paresh Gurudev.

977
01:56:22,175 --> 01:56:24,268
And l drink too much.

978
01:56:38,191 --> 01:56:39,249
My name is Sunil.

979
01:56:40,159 --> 01:56:42,753
And l haven't drink a drop of alchahol
since two weeks.

980
01:56:48,034 --> 01:56:52,971
l want to share my story with you
today.

981
01:56:56,275 --> 01:57:00,507
Before drinking liqour,
my life was perfect.

982
01:57:01,748 --> 01:57:03,807
l was a collage persident.

983
01:57:05,251 --> 01:57:06,513
l was good at sports.

984
01:57:07,653 --> 01:57:09,052
l was good at studies.

985
01:57:11,324 --> 01:57:12,348
And then

986
01:57:13,860 --> 01:57:15,919
Anjali came in my life.

987
01:57:17,363 --> 01:57:23,734
Anjali was a very simple and quiet girl.

988
01:57:39,218 --> 01:57:41,209
But when l began to know her,
l found out that she was dynamic.

989
01:57:42,021 --> 01:57:43,318
And beautiful too.

990
01:57:44,524 --> 01:57:47,618
Sport, basketball, racing cars.

991
01:57:48,061 --> 01:57:50,791
She was interested in everything which
l was interested in.

992
01:57:53,733 --> 01:57:56,668
My morning began with and my evening
with her.

993
01:57:57,370 --> 01:58:00,362
People used to say that we're the
best couple.

994
01:58:01,507 --> 01:58:02,337
And then

995
01:58:04,544 --> 01:58:06,478
One day she left.

996
01:58:08,114 --> 01:58:09,138
Without saying anything.

997
01:58:10,750 --> 01:58:11,409
Dissappeard.

998
01:58:13,252 --> 01:58:15,277
l lost my friends.

999
01:58:17,557 --> 01:58:18,683
My results were getting poor.

1000
01:58:21,694 --> 01:58:25,095
l got upset with everything in life.

1001
01:58:27,100 --> 01:58:27,498
And...

1002
01:58:31,704 --> 01:58:33,535
And l started drinking.

1003
01:58:41,747 --> 01:58:43,374
l don't know why she left me.

1004
01:58:51,858 --> 01:58:53,120
Our Kartika is Anjali.

1005
01:58:53,292 --> 01:58:55,487
And not just this,
Anjali is our Kartika.

1006
01:58:58,030 --> 01:59:00,521
And...
l'm going to her house.

1007
01:59:10,943 --> 01:59:14,845
Amrita, Mr. Agarwal has a called a
meeting on department heads.

1008
01:59:47,747 --> 01:59:49,078
Mulchand Nata.

1009
01:59:51,551 --> 01:59:52,779
Complete silence.

1010
02:00:06,566 --> 02:00:08,534
l phoned you.

1011
02:01:37,323 --> 02:01:38,551
Want water?
Yes

1012
02:01:49,001 --> 02:01:52,061
Do you want tea?
Yes.

1013
02:01:52,371 --> 02:01:53,497
Then go ahead and make it.

1014
02:01:57,777 --> 02:01:58,573
For me too.

1015
02:02:03,849 --> 02:02:04,679
Me too

1016
02:02:13,659 --> 02:02:14,523
Now speak.

1017
02:02:15,995 --> 02:02:18,828
Actually l came to speak to you about
Anjali.

1018
02:02:21,467 --> 02:02:23,799
Don't even say her name.

1019
02:02:24,070 --> 02:02:26,800
She's dead for us.

1020
02:02:28,874 --> 02:02:30,068
Why are you asking us?

1021
02:02:31,544 --> 02:02:33,307
Go and ask that Professor Mantrik.

1022
02:02:45,057 --> 02:02:47,617
Somebody told me that l don't even
know the address of the office.

1023
02:02:49,028 --> 02:02:50,086
But i know now.

1024
02:02:51,364 --> 02:02:53,525
l need your support to know
everything else.

1025
02:03:24,663 --> 02:03:26,688
l broke your heart.

1026
02:03:38,978 --> 02:03:41,003
Shut up or l'll beat you.

1027
02:03:42,281 --> 02:03:44,249
You were crying for me.

1028
02:04:19,552 --> 02:04:20,541
Went to your house.

1029
02:04:28,727 --> 02:04:29,716
How is everybody?

1030
02:04:31,464 --> 02:04:32,362
Alive

1031
02:04:33,699 --> 02:04:35,690
But don't know how long they'll
survive with eachother?

1032
02:04:42,174 --> 02:04:43,732
lf l wouldn't have ran from that
house...

1033
02:04:44,944 --> 02:04:46,241
...l would've gone crazy.

1034
02:04:49,315 --> 02:04:50,782
What l had to do to live.

1035
02:04:52,184 --> 02:04:52,809
l did.

1036
02:04:56,555 --> 02:04:58,147
lt was better than going back home.

1037
02:05:00,259 --> 02:05:00,748
And you

1038
02:05:02,294 --> 02:05:03,386
Where is your family?

1039
02:05:05,664 --> 02:05:06,756
Mom and Dad are in lndia.

1040
02:05:08,601 --> 02:05:09,260
They're married.

1041
02:05:10,503 --> 02:05:11,663
Not to each other.

1042
02:05:12,404 --> 02:05:13,029
They're happy.

1043
02:05:15,341 --> 02:05:16,603
But not with each other.

1044
02:05:20,246 --> 02:05:21,213
No, No.
lt's good.

1045
02:05:21,780 --> 02:05:23,008
lf they were here,
They'd be irritating.

1046
02:05:24,383 --> 02:05:27,079
Long distance relationship is
best in our family.

1047
02:05:46,906 --> 02:05:48,396
What is in the breakfast?

1048
02:05:48,574 --> 02:05:50,906
Everything is in breakfast.
But no choice.

1049
02:05:53,579 --> 02:05:55,513
l want butter.
Am l your serv...

1050
02:05:57,416 --> 02:05:59,008
You're looking happy.

1051
02:06:03,956 --> 02:06:05,048
Congratulations.

1052
02:06:18,237 --> 02:06:19,261
lt's your last day.

1053
02:06:23,342 --> 02:06:25,003
l'm going to meet professor Mantrik.

1054
02:06:33,218 --> 02:06:34,617
l have to tell Abhi all this.

1055
02:06:42,795 --> 02:06:43,523
You know.

1056
02:07:19,264 --> 02:07:20,253
ls professor Mantrik here?

1057
02:07:21,767 --> 02:07:23,928
Are you from his support group?

1058
02:07:31,377 --> 02:07:34,744
l had a student.

1059
02:07:38,117 --> 02:07:38,811
Anjanli

1060
02:07:40,119 --> 02:07:43,452
She told me so many times.
lnfact she...

1061
02:07:46,859 --> 02:07:48,190
That l should give tuitions.

1062
02:07:50,696 --> 02:07:54,632
ln the starting l was a bit nervous.

1063
02:07:59,171 --> 02:08:00,468
But then in while.

1064
02:08:02,107 --> 02:08:05,565
My nervousness went away.

1065
02:08:17,823 --> 02:08:20,792
l used to childish with Anjali.

1066
02:08:21,293 --> 02:08:24,353
Tell you truth,
My Anjali was very innocent.

1067
02:08:37,643 --> 02:08:39,611
But my wife didn't think that way.

1068
02:09:02,367 --> 02:09:05,825
Anjali left me.

1069
02:09:12,978 --> 02:09:13,876
Her name is Anjali.

1070
02:09:14,379 --> 02:09:15,778
Her family is alive.

1071
02:09:16,281 --> 02:09:18,078
And that mother and daughter painting,
Her mother didn't paint it.

1072
02:09:18,317 --> 02:09:19,648
She bought it from a art gallery.

1073
02:09:22,955 --> 02:09:24,081
All this was to fool you.

1074
02:09:24,723 --> 02:09:25,747
And she's done it before.

1075
02:09:29,461 --> 02:09:31,452
Abhi,
Are you listening?

1076
02:09:33,332 --> 02:09:36,893
l was crying.
l was begging for kartika.

1077
02:09:38,470 --> 02:09:41,200
l was sleeping at night and was
drinking in day.

1078
02:09:42,608 --> 02:09:44,075
l was down in my own eyes.

1079
02:09:46,812 --> 02:09:48,439
l thought that both of you are
with me.

1080
02:09:49,848 --> 02:09:52,544
But no,
Both of you are the reason of it.

1081
02:10:07,566 --> 02:10:09,329
Both of you,
one day before my wedding.

1082
02:10:09,601 --> 02:10:11,432
Kidnapped my going to be wife.

1083
02:10:11,603 --> 02:10:14,572
But she's deceiving you.

1084
02:10:15,941 --> 02:10:18,239
l was going to get married to Kartika,
l was happy.

1085
02:10:18,811 --> 02:10:21,336
But you broke all that because you
love me.

1086
02:10:24,917 --> 02:10:27,579
You used the friendship,
You used love.

1087
02:10:29,254 --> 02:10:31,779
Abhi, Why don't you understand?
Understand what?

1088
02:10:32,157 --> 02:10:34,455
That her professor abuses her
sexually.

1089
02:10:34,827 --> 02:10:37,796
And then he pretends right in front
of others, that Kartika made him serious.

1090
02:10:39,198 --> 02:10:40,756
And her parents kicks her out.

1091
02:10:41,233 --> 02:10:45,033
After a incident like this i would've change
my ldentity also.

1092
02:10:48,006 --> 02:10:50,702
Are you getting married or
doing charity?

1093
02:10:51,410 --> 02:10:55,141
Don't ever show me your face after today.
For that l'll have to see yours.

1094
02:11:05,791 --> 02:11:07,019
l'm getting married to Kartika.

1095
02:11:53,572 --> 02:11:55,631
He'll come crying tomorow when he
realizes.

1096
02:11:56,808 --> 02:11:58,503
l'll die but l won't help him.

1097
02:12:16,028 --> 02:12:17,290
You remember our demand, Right?

1098
02:12:18,130 --> 02:12:19,188
l'll take cash.

1099
02:12:30,309 --> 02:12:34,143
You take Sunil and Mantrik to Abhi's
wedding.

1100
02:12:35,347 --> 02:12:37,178
Why Paglu?

1101
02:13:08,580 --> 02:13:12,744
Kartika?
After quiting alchahol the respect l've..

1102
02:13:14,086 --> 02:13:15,713
Who did Anjali left here?

1103
02:13:51,289 --> 02:13:53,223
l know that l'm not invited in
this wedding.

1104
02:13:58,196 --> 02:14:00,460
Marry me Anjali,

1105
02:14:00,766 --> 02:14:03,360
That we're the soul mates.

1106
02:14:03,935 --> 02:14:06,631
when we promised eachother singing.

1107
02:14:07,172 --> 02:14:08,104
Let go man.

1108
02:14:33,198 --> 02:14:34,358
Anjali stop.

1109
02:14:40,439 --> 02:14:44,273
Your feet are delicate, don't let them touch
the ground, they'll get dirty.

1110
02:14:59,324 --> 02:14:59,983
Hey stop.

1111
02:15:25,350 --> 02:15:27,910
l knew it.

1112
02:15:28,854 --> 02:15:32,654
That you'll come back to me one day.

1113
02:15:34,659 --> 02:15:35,683
My Anjali.

1114
02:15:36,328 --> 02:15:38,228
Sir, please let me go.

1115
02:15:38,830 --> 02:15:42,664
Do you know? Even my wife has left me.

1116
02:15:43,768 --> 02:15:46,362
Now we'll go back to our old days.

1117
02:15:47,172 --> 02:15:48,969
l'll give you tuitions again.

1118
02:15:50,342 --> 02:15:52,606
And you'll become my assistant.

1119
02:15:53,145 --> 02:15:55,511
Both of us will enjoy.

1120
02:15:55,780 --> 02:15:58,613
Your favorite strawberry icecream.

1121
02:16:00,552 --> 02:16:04,352
We'll eat it together.

1122
02:16:32,184 --> 02:16:34,914
We'll get married.

1123
02:16:35,220 --> 02:16:36,812
All this was Paglu's ldea.

1124
02:16:39,157 --> 02:16:42,388
Why do you listen to Paglu?
All of you are after her.

1125
02:16:50,802 --> 02:16:52,099
Workout before wedding.

1126
02:16:53,405 --> 02:16:55,703
You called all of them, Right?

1127
02:16:59,377 --> 02:17:01,106
Now you'll save me from them.

1128
02:17:03,048 --> 02:17:05,482
Anjali, Please marry me.

1129
02:17:06,518 --> 02:17:09,919
Look l still have it close to me
in your memory.

1130
02:17:34,479 --> 02:17:35,878
This wedding can't go on.

1131
02:17:43,521 --> 02:17:44,613
What's all this?

1132
02:17:45,457 --> 02:17:47,516
Anjali, come back home.

1133
02:17:48,126 --> 02:17:49,650
Enough drama.

1134
02:18:12,984 --> 02:18:14,349
This is Kripa.

1135
02:18:15,020 --> 02:18:16,988
Kartika's husband.

1136
02:18:18,890 --> 02:18:19,481
Husband.

1137
02:18:33,371 --> 02:18:34,429
What did we say?

1138
02:18:34,873 --> 02:18:37,637
Okay.
She has told me everything already.

1139
02:18:37,809 --> 02:18:40,277
She lied everytime and you beleived her
everytime.

1140
02:18:42,781 --> 02:18:45,409
She told me that she's married.

1141
02:18:46,818 --> 02:18:49,286
That you're the best friend in the world.

1142
02:18:50,488 --> 02:18:53,423
And l don't love her,
l love Amu.

1143
02:18:58,830 --> 02:19:01,390
Who's saying all this?
Kartika

1144
02:19:02,400 --> 02:19:04,834
She refused to marry me before
you came.

1145
02:19:07,972 --> 02:19:09,166
For marriege just...

1146
02:19:10,909 --> 02:19:12,342
There should be only one reason.

1147
02:19:18,049 --> 02:19:19,311
Amu said that.

1148
02:19:22,220 --> 02:19:23,812
whatever l did till today?

1149
02:19:25,623 --> 02:19:27,113
l did it for my survival.

1150
02:19:35,166 --> 02:19:35,962
Not anymore.

1151
02:19:40,338 --> 02:19:41,737
l'm glad with Amu.

1152
02:19:46,878 --> 02:19:48,311
l can't marry you.

1153
02:19:48,680 --> 02:19:52,172
She said that she'll only marry who
loves her most.

1154
02:19:53,184 --> 02:19:54,242
And it wasn't me.

1155
02:19:56,221 --> 02:19:58,121
Kartika said that.
Yes.

1156
02:19:59,724 --> 02:20:01,191
But the one l love...

1157
02:20:01,926 --> 02:20:02,984
...she doesn't love me.

1158
02:20:03,895 --> 02:20:06,363
Kartika said that too.

1159
02:20:12,404 --> 02:20:13,098
Tell me Paglu.

1160
02:20:14,005 --> 02:20:16,166
lf l tell her that how much l love her.

1161
02:20:17,475 --> 02:20:19,033
Will she say yes.

1162
02:20:22,947 --> 02:20:23,777
Fire or water.

1163
02:20:24,682 --> 02:20:25,444
No, lt is.

1164
02:20:26,484 --> 02:20:27,473
Try man.

1165
02:20:28,520 --> 02:20:29,248
She might say yes.

1166
02:21:03,188 --> 02:21:06,817
Finaly started to lisenting to you.
Who? Abhi or Jhumroo.

1167
02:21:08,426 --> 02:21:08,915
Both

1168
02:22:10,755 --> 02:22:12,052
Didn't you go to your in-laws?

1169
02:22:14,359 --> 02:22:16,657
Now they're my ex in-laws.

1170
02:22:19,230 --> 02:22:22,324
Thank God.
Vinkat finaly signed the divorce papers.

1171
02:22:24,802 --> 02:22:26,497
Or l would be running again.

1172
02:22:33,912 --> 02:22:35,004
What's your plan?

1173
02:22:35,813 --> 02:22:37,974
Nothing.
l've decided...

1174
02:22:38,383 --> 02:22:39,782
...That l live a peaceful life.

1175
02:22:39,951 --> 02:22:41,509
l'll marry a peacfull girl.

1176
02:22:41,953 --> 02:22:44,444
And l'll die peacefully.

1177
02:22:47,225 --> 02:22:48,624
lt's very peacefull plan.

1178
02:23:04,075 --> 02:23:06,373
Will you be happy with a peacefull
girl?

1179
02:23:07,645 --> 02:23:08,976
Will have to try.

1180
02:23:09,814 --> 02:23:13,306
Because the alternative is very
dangerous.

1181
02:23:18,056 --> 02:23:22,254
Try it.
lt might not be that dangerous.
