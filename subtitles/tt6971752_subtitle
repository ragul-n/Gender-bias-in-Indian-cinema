1
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:09,791
'And thus begins another Great
Indian Wedding Spectacle.'

2
00:02:10,291 --> 00:02:13,166
'In other words... A Delhi Wedding.'

3
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:14,041
'Honestly speaking...'

4
00:02:14,541 --> 00:02:17,750
'...I was never in favor
of such a grand-wedding.'

5
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,708
'I always wanted to elope and get married.'

6
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:22,291
'First, I would've fought with my family.'

7
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:25,125
'Imagine, night-time, on
a bike, the highway...'

8
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:27,041
'Just the two of us, and a bag.'

9
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:28,208
'The bag filled with few clothes...'

10
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:30,625
'...and a promise of everlasting love.'

11
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:34,291
'Papa would've abused my
husband over the phone.'

12
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:36,958
'Mom would've slipped into
depression... and...'

13
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:39,708
'Well, a lot could've
happened, if I had eloped.'

14
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:41,250
'But, before any of this
could come true...'

15
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,291
'...Mudit came into my life.'

16
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:44,791
'Frankly speaking, until 2 weeks ago...'

17
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:47,331
'...everyone was so concerned
about my marriage...'

18
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:48,938
as if India's GDP depended on it.'

19
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:49,875
'As soon as I said 'yes'...

20
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:51,291
'...I became the 'Raymond Man' overnight.'

21
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:53,000
'For the first time, someone
asked for my opinion...'

22
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,101
'...in Pammi aunty's land dispute case.'

23
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:57,853
'A glass was automatically reserved
for me in the car's trunk.'

24
00:02:58,333 --> 00:02:59,541
'Suddenly, my opinion
mattered in everything...'

25
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:01,708
'...ranging from politics to
my nephew's mushroom haircut!'

26
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:04,875
'Seriously dude, I am Mudit...
not Mahesh Bhatt.'

27
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:08,875
'And then, everything suddenly changed
when I met Sughandha 2 weeks ago.'

28
00:03:16,644 --> 00:03:17,684
'You call that a meeting?'

29
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:19,428
'You wouldn't even come up and talk to me.'

30
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:23,416
'Oh great, you knew that I was...
- Interested in me.'

31
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:25,791
'The entire Nehru Place knew that.'

32
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:28,211
But, why doesn't he say something?
- Is he mute?

33
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:29,541
Out of cash! Out of cash!

34
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:31,156
- Oh, God! - We're out of cash.

35
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:31,375
Please leave.

36
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:33,795
Listen, I am going to the
ATM at the back, okay.

37
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:35,000
Sugandha! Sugandha!

38
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:35,708
'Oh really?'

39
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:38,291
'So, what was your first impression of me?'

40
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:40,083
'Nothing...'

41
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:42,666
'One shouldn't form
opinions about Delhi guys.'

42
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:44,886
'Or you end up with too many expectations.'

43
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:46,083
'And, you were so weird.'

44
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:48,218
You took so long to come
up and talk to me.'

45
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:49,981
You could've approached me instead.'

46
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:52,005
'No way... the girl never
makes the first move.

47
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:53,333
It's always the boy!'

48
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,041
'Now, you're making up your own rules.

49
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:55,541
- That's the rule.'

50
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:56,583
'I don't agree.'

51
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:57,041
Stop it you two.

52
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:58,333
What have we been doing
for the last one month?

53
00:03:58,833 --> 00:03:59,833
Counting fountain lights,

54
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:00,458
Eating kilos of groundnuts!

55
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:02,039
And now... this bear dance.

56
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,333
Come one... come all.

57
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:06,434
She's looking this way. - Who, the bear?

58
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:07,416
Don't lose focus, my friend.

59
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:09,125
She is looking at the bear.

60
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:09,875
Don't just stand there and stare.

61
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,375
Go talk to her.

62
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:13,301
Look, man, sister-in-law
is our birth-right.

63
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:15,623
Go on... don't just stand there.
- Fine, I am going.

64
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:16,708
Bro, I beg you..

65
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:18,333
I said I am going! - Go now!

66
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,333
Please, go.

67
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:21,166
Do it.

68
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:22,666
Go Simran... go!

69
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:24,208
He's coming.

70
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:25,875
He's coming this way. - Wait. He's coming.

71
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:29,875
He'll talk... he'll talk this time...
Go on.

72
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:39,458
Get him off.

73
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:42,625
Shoo... shoo...

74
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:44,208
Get him off.

75
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:45,208
He'll bite me... He'll bite me...

76
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:47,083
Someone get him off!

77
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:48,983
Get him off. - Don't get too close.

78
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:51,333
Hold on... Hold on... Let it go.

79
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,458
Get him off me.

80
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:54,958
Do something, will you?

81
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:57,000
What can I do, mister?

82
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,500
Shoo...

83
00:04:58,833 --> 00:04:59,333
Give me that cloth...

84
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:00,833
Hit him!

85
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:02,166
Get him off!

86
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:02,750
Get him off! Get him off!

87
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:03,625
Get him off!

88
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:06,041
That thing will kill him.

89
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:08,750
So, you were approaching the girl...

90
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:13,333
when a bear jumped on you? - Yeah!

91
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:15,333
You're insane.

92
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:18,458
All this effort to talk to a girl.

93
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:21,333
You should've sent her a
proposal online instead.

94
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:24,416
You want me to send her a proposal online?

95
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:26,333
Why? Don't you watch TV?

96
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:30,041
Those who get jumped by a
bear, send proposals online.

97
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:32,541
You know what, create a
nice profile for yourself.

98
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,279
And, don't worry if she says yes.

99
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:35,625
We'll take it from there.

100
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:39,125
And remember, try not to
make spelling mistakes.

101
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:41,041
"Say it out loud..."

102
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:45,000
"That your son is a coward."

103
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:49,000
"And, I will spare 'his life."

104
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:56,625
"Earlier, I was always worried
about my daughter's security."

105
00:05:57,125 --> 00:06:01,166
"You know how vulnerable
young girls can be."

106
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:04,375
"But then, I learned about
this safety device."

107
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:06,208
"One device stays with me..."

108
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:07,708
Go... Mom!

109
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:09,333
"...and the other one is always
in my daughter's purse."

110
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:11,916
"That's how I keep a tab on my daughter."

111
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:13,916
"And now I can sleep peacefully."

112
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:17,458
"And, even my sugar
levels have normalized."

113
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:19,079
Wow Vimla, you were amazing.

114
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:20,958
I am really proud of you.

115
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:22,458
You're looking fantastic.

116
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:24,125
Brother, what do you think?

117
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:25,083
She looks weak.

118
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:25,916
Isn't that right?

119
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:27,537
She's looking fat. - I know.

120
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:29,166
Sugu's in a really good mood.

121
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:30,946
I think we should talk to her...

122
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,480
about the online proposal we
received last night. - Yeah...

123
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:37,041
Speak softly, otherwise,
brother will overhear you.

124
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:39,125
Brother... - Yeah...

125
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:41,665
You're discussing Sugu's
wedding, and I don't know.

126
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:42,833
What? - No, it's not what you think.

127
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:44,333
Let's discuss this later.

128
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:45,988
Your wedding? - What's going on?

129
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:47,375
Why later?

130
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:49,666
Are we trying to jinx your happiness?

131
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:51,287
Stop yelling at me, brother.

132
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:52,750
I haven't spoken to Sugu about this either.

133
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:53,750
Let's make one thing clear.

134
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,930
Who's the eldest in the family, me or her?

135
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:57,208
You see, brother.

136
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:58,000
You're the eldest in your family,

137
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,621
and I am the eldest in mine.

138
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:01,029
Doesn't matter how old you get...

139
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:01,833
but, I am always going
to be older to you.

140
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:03,125
Were you even going to invite
me to your daughter's wedding?

141
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:04,750
Which daughter?

142
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,250
What wedding?

143
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:06,750
Brother...

144
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,290
My wedding's been fixed...

145
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,750
and I don't know about it.
- Can't you stay quiet?

146
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,041
You like getting yourself humiliated.

147
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:15,041
If they don't want to invite
you to the wedding...

148
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:17,102
then, that's their decision. - What?

149
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:17,708
You know what, Vimla.

150
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:19,750
Let us know whenever you fix
a date for the wedding.

151
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,666
We'll come over if we're not busy.

152
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:23,166
Hold on a second...

153
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:25,416
You guys even fixed a date for my
wedding, and I don't know anything.

154
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:27,416
Can you please stop ranting about
'Humiliation', sister-in-law

155
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:29,333
We paid for your popcorn.

156
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:31,033
And, I was just telling him...

157
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:32,458
that, we'll ask brother to
perform the rituals at her wedding.

158
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:35,000
What rituals? - That's true.

159
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,750
Will someone tell me who sent the proposal?

160
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,530
It was an online proposal, dear.

161
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:40,291
- Online?

162
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:41,791
And you...

163
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:44,333
Did you tell us when Neelam
flunked her college?

164
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:47,250
No!

165
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,708
That's enough! - Why drag her in all this?

166
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:51,208
One second.

167
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:52,416
So, is this revenge?

168
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:54,196
We would've definitely told you.

169
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:56,611
But, you forgot all about us
as soon as you left Haridwar.

170
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:57,333
How can you forget your childhood days...

171
00:07:57,833 --> 00:07:58,416
when you used to pee on my shoulder?

172
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:01,458
I'll do it again if you behave
like that same elder brother.

173
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:03,118
I am that same elder brother.

174
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:03,666
I certainly am...

175
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:04,666
Else, I would've demanded to share...

176
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:06,333
the expenses of our
father's death anniversary.

177
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:08,154
But I am being generous with you.

178
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:10,833
Will someone show me who sent the proposal?

179
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:13,458
He's a really nice boy. - Boy?

180
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:15,041
What is that?

181
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:17,458
Girls school... girls college...
girl-friends.

182
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:19,118
Even for my swimming classes,

183
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:20,856
you enrolled me in the girl's batch.

184
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,708
Now what do I do with a guy?

185
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:24,875
Show her. - Just a second...

186
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:26,375
Here you go, dear.

187
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:27,333
I thought... - Take a look...

188
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:29,394
Not again... - Wait, I'll show you too.

189
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:29,958
Stop behaving like a kid.

190
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:32,041
Ginny, it's him. - Oh, my...

191
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:33,541
It's the same bear guy!

192
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:34,791
How dare he?!

193
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:37,333
All he had to do was ask for my number...

194
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:39,113
But, he sends a proposal online?

195
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:39,958
This isn't right.

196
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:42,125
Can only hot girls have a love-story?

197
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:44,250
Don't normal girls have any feelings?

198
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,270
Look at his package first. - I
don't even want to see his face.

199
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:48,666
I've been cheated.

200
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:50,250
Love-stories never begin
after the wedding...

201
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:51,458
it always comes to an end, Ginny.

202
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:55,708
If you have a problem then just say no.

203
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:57,875
But he's a decent guy.

204
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:00,666
How can I say no?

205
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:02,916
I had such high hopes.

206
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:05,096
First, we'll start by giving missed calls.

207
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:06,791
Then, we'll go out together...

208
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:11,208
But, he just ruined all my plans.

209
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:13,625
It's so hard to find a
decent guy these days.

210
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:17,625
And, the ones who...

211
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:22,750
He turned my 'love' into
'arranged' (marriage).

212
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:26,333
But now, I am going to find
love in this arrangement.

213
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:30,333
It's not as easy as it looks.

214
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:43,194
Is there anyone here called Mudit?

215
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,958
I'll call you back.

216
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:45,875
There are two.

217
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:48,833
Sharma and Shrivastava.

218
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:50,333
The 'bear' guy.

219
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:51,416
I see...

220
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,500
Hold on.

221
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:55,083
Hello. Mudit, someone here to see you.

222
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:59,208
And, you are...

223
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:02,875
Are you a wimp?

224
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:04,958
No... Sharma, from Gurgaon!

225
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:05,958
And, on my mother's side...

226
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:08,208
I didn't ask about your caste.

227
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:12,208
Come out.

228
00:10:13,864 --> 00:10:16,184
What were you thinking when you
sent that online proposal?

229
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:18,128
These days guys don't want
to put in any effort.

230
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,666
You've been checking me out
for almost a month now...

231
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:22,807
yet, you couldn't muster the
courage to come up and talk to me?

232
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:24,805
Every day I end up extending my lunch time

233
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:26,333
I already bought three video
games for my brother.

234
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:28,458
I even bought three software and
four DVDs from the market...

235
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:31,291
and still you didn't approach me.
- But, I did.

236
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:35,625
But, I had no clue that the bear
was interested in me as well.

237
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:36,416
Now, you're laughing.

238
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:38,666
See, you're laughing!

239
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:40,416
How could I talk to you?

240
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:42,833
This is getting so embarrassing.

241
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:45,166
Is that why you sent an online proposal?

242
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:46,866
I didn't have any option left?

243
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:50,041
I practiced really hard... talking to you.

244
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:51,833
In fact, I had rehearsed
everything by-heart.

245
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:53,083
But, that's the problem with me.

246
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:54,125
Never had a problem in theory...

247
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:55,166
but, I always failed in practicals.

248
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:56,666
Mudit. - Yeah...

249
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:57,750
That wasn't right.

250
00:10:58,083 --> 00:10:59,333
The boss was asking for the report.
- I am on it.

251
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:00,875
But listen... - The company won't shut down

252
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:03,458
But this is important. - Get lost.

253
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:06,916
Go...

254
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,875
Is he a friend? - Just someone I know.

255
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:12,875
He was trying to make an
impression, that's all.

256
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:14,375
Well, I'll leave now.

257
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:17,208
Or, you might get yelled at by your boss.

258
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:20,208
He's on a leave. He's got loosies.

259
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:21,333
Anyway I don't intend to work here forever.

260
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:23,073
I've already applied elsewhere.

261
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:24,833
As soon as I get a call...

262
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:28,666
Two cups of tea...

263
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:31,041
No worries, I'll have it...

264
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:32,666
Take this sir.

265
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:33,458
I just asked for tea.

266
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:35,079
Smoking is bad for health...

267
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:38,666
Can't you see I'm with someone?

268
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:44,958
Are you an engineer? - Diploma from NIT

269
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:45,583
Oh really...

270
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:47,916
Which one? - Pitampura.

271
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:51,166
Doesn't Mr. Asthana teach there?
- He's a bloody pervert.

272
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:54,750
He's our family friend.

273
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,333
Sorry...

274
00:11:56,833 --> 00:12:01,083
Well... he is quite a pervert.

275
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:04,041
So, if you get that new job,
you'll move out of here.

276
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:06,666
Then, you will look at
other girls, won't you?

277
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:08,208
There's a thing called
'loyaltyness' in life.

278
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:10,250
Really?

279
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,911
Which means if the bear hadn't
interrupted that day...

280
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:15,333
you would've stuck to me like glue.

281
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:17,958
You girls are too much, you know.

282
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:21,291
You want everything, don't you?

283
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:22,166
Okay, bye.

284
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:26,916
Sorry for yelling at you.

285
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:28,833
'Yes' or 'no'?

286
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:30,333
Even I shop online...

287
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,416
but, not before trying out the
stuff few times at the shop.

288
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:34,083
It's free you know.

289
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:35,583
Then, try me.

290
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:39,041
Who's stopping you?

291
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:40,583
When a girl says 'no', it
basically means 'yes'.

292
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:43,041
And boys who believe that are stupid.

293
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:44,581
So that means you said no.

294
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:46,041
You're so negative, you know.

295
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:47,666
Let's meet then...

296
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:49,326
I'll change your no into yes.

297
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:50,746
Fine, let's meet... - Where?

298
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:51,458
Online.

299
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:53,039
You prefer that, don't you?

300
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:54,166
No bear to interrupt us either.

301
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:55,666
But, with your parents...

302
00:12:55,958 --> 00:13:00,166
I don't trust these online types.

303
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:02,208
I am making the call, okay.

304
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:03,166
Can they see us?

305
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:04,125
What about the volume?

306
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:05,625
It's connected.

307
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:07,039
Sound... where's the sound?

308
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:08,333
It's connected. Please...

309
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:09,833
Why is it so slow?

310
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:10,958
Oh, they're here...

311
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:12,416
So many people.

312
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,500
Hello. - Hello.

313
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:15,333
Hello.

314
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:19,458
Touch their feet.

315
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:22,625
Not mine, theirs... - It's alright, dear.

316
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:24,833
There's no need.

317
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:26,573
And anyway, we're quite modern.

318
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:28,358
Actually, we're quite modern too...

319
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:30,166
But you see, when bending
down to touch the feet...

320
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:34,708
its exercise for the back muscles
and also acupressure for the feet.

321
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:36,208
But, you look healthy.

322
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,041
Let it be, dear.

323
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:43,416
Dear, did you make that
painting on the wall?

324
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:45,166
Which one?

325
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:45,708
This one?

326
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:47,648
Oh, no-no... that's just a wet-patch.

327
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:48,666
Which one...

328
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:49,708
I see...

329
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:53,291
I thought it's modern art.

330
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:59,750
Uncle... - Huh?

331
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:01,833
Sir... - Yes...

332
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:04,125
I think we should leave now.

333
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:06,791
And, give the children some privacy.
- Yeah...

334
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:08,291
Go where?

335
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,333
Let's... - You guys stay, I... I'll go.

336
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:13,833
Son-in-law's leaving instead.

337
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:15,833
Don't move the laptop, it's
connected to the wifi...

338
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:17,583
Okay... - Yeah...

339
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:19,083
Come on... come on...

340
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:19,833
Come on, son. - I'll beat you.

341
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:21,875
Follow me.

342
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:25,083
Hi. - Hello.

343
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:27,166
How are you? - I am fine.

344
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:31,166
Yesterday...

345
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,708
Every time I look at you, it
reminds me of the bear...

346
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:42,000
Excuse me, that was a compliment.

347
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:47,416
I'm sure the bear saw something
interesting that he jumped on me.

348
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:49,041
I see.

349
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:53,583
I didn't see the bear at all,
my concentration was on you.

350
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:54,833
I mean... I was completely
focused on you...

351
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:56,613
Like Arjun's eye, you know......

352
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:58,916
You mean, the fish eye... - Exactly.

353
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:04,083
Tell me something... why
do you want to marry me?

354
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:06,916
I like you...

355
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:10,333
Whenever I look at you,
I want to talk to you.

356
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:13,875
I've worked for marketing all my
life and sold a lot of things.

357
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:16,255
But for the first time,
I am presenting myself.

358
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,666
My family's been insisting
that I get married.

359
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:23,041
But, I only said 'yes' after I saw you.

360
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:28,166
I don't know whether your answer's
going to be 'yes' or 'no'. But...

361
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:32,166
You are special.

362
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:39,166
Do you know Birla Temple?

363
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:45,708
Is that a 'yes'? - Well,
it's not a 'no' either.

364
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:48,250
I'll take the auspicious
token from your mother...

365
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,270
but, I haven't made up my mind yet,

366
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:54,041
if you should get the
token from my mother.

367
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:56,083
Okay, bye.

368
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:57,583
Mummy!

369
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:58,708
What are you doing there?

370
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,031
Come here... She's calling you.

371
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:01,208
Brother... - Yeah...

372
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:03,666
You really spent a lot.

373
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:04,833
Did you have this kind of money?

374
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:06,166
I spent my entire savings on this.

375
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:07,666
Doesn't it look lavish?

376
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:09,875
You should've spent
according to your status.

377
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:11,458
This isn't the wedding,
it's just the engagement.

378
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:13,559
Brother, I'll borrow money if I have to.

379
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:14,041
She's my only daughter.

380
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:17,041
I'll do the best I can.

381
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:18,875
We only had one father...

382
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:20,083
But, you didn't spend a dime
on his death anniversary.

383
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:21,458
Do you realize what you're saying, brother?

384
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:22,333
This is such an auspicious moment...

385
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:23,166
Children are getting engaged...

386
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:24,833
Come here. - Coming!

387
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:26,333
And you're just... - Papa,
where do I plug this in?

388
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:28,793
The batteries are almost dead!
- Plug it in here.

389
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:29,208
Coming.

390
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:30,708
What a pathetic man!

391
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:32,319
That's no way to talk to children.

392
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:34,250
No shame at all. - What happened?

393
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,041
He was just asking where do
I plug in the charger...

394
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:40,041
and he said to plug it in here.

395
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:46,583
Mom. - Hmm?

396
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:49,791
I haven't said 'yes' for this wedding yet.

397
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:52,125
I never said 'yes' to your father either.

398
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:53,865
But we spent 30 years together.

399
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:55,750
It's not the same thing, mom.

400
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,530
I am not sure about this at all.

401
00:16:57,666 --> 00:16:58,906
No one's ever sure at your age.

402
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,458
What are you saying?

403
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:02,358
What does age have to do with this?

404
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:05,000
Tell me what to do.

405
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,541
Stop making faces first.

406
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:08,416
And remember to sport a big smile.

407
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:12,117
Otherwise, you'll be stuck with an ugly
wedding album for the rest of your life.

408
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:14,458
You just don't get it.

409
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:17,375
Mom, Mudit and I met a few days ago.

410
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:19,275
It's a great time you're living in.

411
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,660
At least you two got to meet.

412
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:22,426
You got the chance to
understand each other.

413
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,375
You know, your father I and I
got engaged over a telegram.

414
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:26,416
"Congratulations. for. the. Engagement."

415
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:27,916
Full stop."

416
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:28,250
Come on, dear.

417
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,270
Get ready, everyone's waiting outside.

418
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,750
Only I am not ready.

419
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,791
Mom...

420
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:38,250
Don't hand over the envelope
until I don't say so.

421
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:42,791
Just don't... - But... I...

422
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:44,791
What a weird girl.

423
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:48,958
You know what, let's get
over with the formalities..

424
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:52,916
Before the gift and fruit
baskets get spoilt

425
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:54,416
You're absolutely right.

426
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:55,875
Where were you?

427
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:57,541
Come, stand here.

428
00:17:58,041 --> 00:18:01,250
Here you go, dear.

429
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:05,250
Keep it.

430
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:10,750
Congratulations...

431
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:14,750
It's your turn now.

432
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:20,208
Where's the envelope? - Did
you forget it at home?

433
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:21,750
Where is it?

434
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:22,625
Check your purse,

435
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:25,458
Must be in there.

436
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:27,478
Yes, I did keep it in my purse, but...

437
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:29,146
I've to use the washroom? - Washroom?

438
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:30,708
Mom... - Ginny, go with her.

439
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:31,250
Come on...

440
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,916
See... now she wants to use the washroom.

441
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:36,208
Where did I keep the envelope?

442
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:37,708
You're just too much...

443
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,884
She's talking nonsense,
Doesn't mean a thing.

444
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:41,208
He's gone too.

445
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:42,458
Where's he going?

446
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:43,958
Sugandha.

447
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:47,083
Sugandha. - Mudit?

448
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:49,623
Yeah... I'm listening.
- What am I supposed to say?

449
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:53,375
But you said come to the washroom.
- Yeah, but... I had to go.

450
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:54,875
What are you doing here?

451
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:56,666
Mudit, what are you doing here?

452
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:58,166
Yes, I...

453
00:18:58,541 --> 00:18:59,541
Fine, I'll wait outside.

454
00:18:59,666 --> 00:18:59,916
But, I must speak with you urgently.

455
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:04,125
Come quickly.

456
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:06,166
Wait, I'll be back in 5 minutes.

457
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:10,166
Shhhh.

458
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:15,625
Let's get on with the rituals, please.

459
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:17,206
I haven't thought about it.

460
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:19,041
My entire family's waiting outside.

461
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:21,000
At least give me something.

462
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:25,000
At least a coconut.

463
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:31,000
You're going to embarrass me
in front of my entire family.

464
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:44,833
Mudu... - Megha, you?

465
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:46,625
What a pleasant surprise?

466
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:48,125
What are you doing here?

467
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:49,166
What are you doing here?

468
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:50,041
I came here with my grandma.

469
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:50,916
Where were you? - Grandma...

470
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:52,583
Remember Mudu. - Hello.

471
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:53,083
Take her away.

472
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:54,750
Take her away. - Come on.

473
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,410
But, what are you doing here?

474
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:56,791
It's his engagement,

475
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:57,625
and he's standing here.

476
00:19:58,125 --> 00:19:59,805
God knows where the girl is. - Engagement?

477
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:00,625
Fix the pleats.

478
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:02,125
Coming, uncle.

479
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:03,811
Remember, where did we meet last time.

480
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:05,451
It's been a really long time.

481
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:08,125
I haven't forgotten what
you said that day to me.

482
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,145
Remember what you said to me that day?

483
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:13,625
I am fooled. - Online proposal!

484
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:15,125
You remember.

485
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:16,458
Oh, Mudu.

486
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:18,079
Why is she calling him Mudu?

487
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:19,811
You know, I followed you everywhere...

488
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:20,833
Insta(Instagram)... Snappy (Snapchat)...!

489
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:22,333
What were you saying?

490
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:24,625
You know, actually...

491
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:27,791
Ginny, please talk to her.

492
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:30,541
I am fooled.

493
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:32,041
Is she coming?

494
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:32,791
She's here. She's here.

495
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:33,625
Come, dear.

496
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:37,625
Where is he? - You're back, dear.

497
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:42,458
Hurry up, dear. - Where is he?

498
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:46,458
Tell Tyagi to take a look. - He's here.

499
00:20:57,875 --> 00:21:00,708
Ohh, my... it's right here.

500
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:04,708
Take it. - Take it.

501
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:09,875
Congratulations.

502
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:38,916
"I keep it difficult for
him but doesn't listen"

503
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:43,166
"Kanha doesn't give up"

504
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:47,250
"The world lays traps, he passes with ease"

505
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:51,375
"Steals butter and gets what he please"

506
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:55,458
"His flute is his magic wand"

507
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:59,416
"The road to the..."

508
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:02,875
"The road to the riverbank is tough"

509
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:06,708
"But doesn't listen"

510
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:10,708
"Kanha doesn't give up"

511
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:42,666
Yeah, Sugandha. - Mudit,
there's been a big problem.

512
00:22:43,166 --> 00:22:45,083
We lost the marriage venue.

513
00:22:45,583 --> 00:22:47,458
And that idiot swindled all our money.

514
00:22:47,958 --> 00:22:50,083
Mom and dad are having a big fight.

515
00:22:50,583 --> 00:22:54,083
I'll figure something out.

516
00:23:06,375 --> 00:23:07,708
This is for the booking.

517
00:23:08,208 --> 00:23:09,625
Just don't worry about anything.

518
00:23:10,125 --> 00:23:12,541
We'll get married in Haridwar.

519
00:23:13,041 --> 00:23:14,708
"He stops me"

520
00:23:15,208 --> 00:23:16,750
"He accosts me."

521
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:20,750
"He stalks me on my way to Yamuna"

522
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:24,625
"Shameless, jobless"

523
00:23:25,125 --> 00:23:28,750
"When he throws a stone my pot breaks"

524
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:32,708
"Smooth talker, he enchants me"

525
00:23:33,208 --> 00:23:36,541
"He catches me in the net of love"

526
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:40,708
"He's too quick"

527
00:23:41,208 --> 00:23:44,125
"I request him to go slow"

528
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:48,666
"But no! Doesn't listen"

529
00:23:49,166 --> 00:23:50,166
Take care. - Bye.

530
00:23:50,458 --> 00:23:51,458
And lock the door.

531
00:23:51,625 --> 00:23:52,583
We'll call once we reach Haridwar.
- Bye sister.

532
00:23:53,083 --> 00:23:54,444
We'll be back in a couple of days.

533
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:59,750
"I keep it difficult for him but no...
Doesn't listen"

534
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:03,750
"Kanha doesn't give up"

535
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:20,916
Bye.

536
00:24:21,291 --> 00:24:24,791
Bye.

537
00:25:09,958 --> 00:25:14,750
"I kissed him...

538
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:16,250
No..."

539
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:20,250
"He..."

540
00:25:25,041 --> 00:25:26,791
The bike isn't starting.

541
00:25:27,291 --> 00:25:28,833
I think the engine's heated up.

542
00:25:29,333 --> 00:25:31,041
Can I come in?

543
00:25:31,541 --> 00:25:35,041
Yes.

544
00:25:38,291 --> 00:25:41,791
Lock.

545
00:25:48,416 --> 00:25:53,333
Phone? - I'll fix it.

546
00:25:53,833 --> 00:26:01,583
Where's the battery? - Don't know.

547
00:26:02,083 --> 00:26:05,583
Here it is.

548
00:26:27,184 --> 00:26:28,184
We cannot be too loud

549
00:26:28,208 --> 00:26:31,708
These are government flats.

550
00:26:35,333 --> 00:26:38,833
What happened? - Tiger Balm.

551
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:51,583
What happened?

552
00:26:52,083 --> 00:26:55,875
I had onion bread for lunch.

553
00:26:56,375 --> 00:26:59,541
I see... - Do you have chewing gum?

554
00:27:00,041 --> 00:27:03,541
Yeah...

555
00:27:07,166 --> 00:27:10,666
It's strawberry.

556
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:39,000
Do you have another room?

557
00:28:02,291 --> 00:28:05,875
Is this right? - This is how it's done.

558
00:28:06,375 --> 00:28:10,083
I mean... before marriage...

559
00:28:10,583 --> 00:28:14,583
Well, you did say 'yes' aloud.
- I am not saying no.

560
00:28:15,083 --> 00:28:17,875
You're getting emotional for no reason.

561
00:28:18,375 --> 00:28:19,615
When we go for our honeymoon...

562
00:28:19,791 --> 00:28:22,416
we'll waste time trying
to understand each other.

563
00:28:22,916 --> 00:28:26,416
And, if you feel this is wrong
then I'll leave. - No...

564
00:28:33,166 --> 00:28:34,666
Hold on... - What?

565
00:28:35,166 --> 00:28:37,291
Where's the bathroom?

566
00:28:37,791 --> 00:28:38,991
Wait here, I'll be right back.

567
00:28:39,291 --> 00:28:43,041
"92.7 Big FM."

568
00:28:43,541 --> 00:28:45,625
"My name is Nilesh Mishra."

569
00:28:46,125 --> 00:28:51,125
"And you're listening to 'Memory
lane Idiot Box'on 92.7."

570
00:28:51,625 --> 00:28:54,916
"Today's story is called
"That girl from G-block'."

571
00:28:55,416 --> 00:28:56,875
"Sangeeta Loved Aman."

572
00:28:57,375 --> 00:29:02,833
"But Sangeeta did feel weird
when Aman came over."

573
00:29:03,333 --> 00:29:06,416
"It had been only a couple of minutes
when he sent that text to her."

574
00:29:06,916 --> 00:29:09,583
"I am coming over... is
what he wrote in it."

575
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:14,458
"But Sangeeta felt like she's
been waiting for ages."

576
00:29:14,958 --> 00:29:16,079
"On the other side, Aman..."

577
00:29:16,333 --> 00:29:19,208
"How's he going to tell
Sangeeta what's on his mind?"

578
00:29:19,708 --> 00:29:22,458
"What if she misunderstands him?"

579
00:29:22,958 --> 00:29:26,791
"He must have drunk over a dozen cold
drink bottles at the local shop..."

580
00:29:27,291 --> 00:29:30,583
"...only to catch a glimpse of her."

581
00:29:31,083 --> 00:29:32,563
"If Sangeeta feels offended today..."

582
00:29:32,791 --> 00:29:36,583
"...will Aman ever dare
to open another bottle?"

583
00:29:37,083 --> 00:29:40,291
"Why is Aman taking so long?

584
00:29:40,791 --> 00:29:44,666
Did something happen to him?"

585
00:29:45,166 --> 00:29:47,916
"There was a noise at the
iron-gate, she was surprised."

586
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:49,833
"She thought Aman is here."

587
00:29:50,333 --> 00:29:51,833
"But, she was wrong."

588
00:29:52,333 --> 00:29:53,791
"Sangeeta kept waiting, but

589
00:29:54,291 --> 00:29:57,458
Aman went back."

590
00:29:57,958 --> 00:29:59,458
"She could've chased after Aman..."

591
00:29:59,958 --> 00:30:03,583
"...but, she couldn't find her stole."

592
00:30:04,083 --> 00:30:06,250
"There was no activity at the shop either."

593
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:10,250
"That bottle of cold drink
was left unopened."

594
00:30:15,958 --> 00:30:18,833
What's wrong?

595
00:30:19,333 --> 00:30:23,458
There's a problem. - What?

596
00:30:23,958 --> 00:30:26,958
Nothing, it's a gents problem. - But what?

597
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:28,083
Like I said, it's a gents problem.

598
00:30:28,583 --> 00:30:29,583
You won't get it.

599
00:30:29,791 --> 00:30:31,583
I am not stupid.

600
00:30:32,083 --> 00:30:34,958
I know.

601
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:40,000
Know what? - It's common.

602
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:44,000
Happens with anyone.

603
00:30:49,291 --> 00:30:51,291
You've got a boil, isn't it?

604
00:30:51,791 --> 00:30:53,291
Is it swollen?

605
00:30:53,791 --> 00:30:57,083
You can't even sit straight.

606
00:30:57,583 --> 00:31:01,083
It's not what you think.

607
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:07,958
Then what's wrong, Mudit.

608
00:31:08,458 --> 00:31:11,958
Tell me.

609
00:31:36,333 --> 00:31:40,041
Do you love me?

610
00:31:40,541 --> 00:31:44,041
What are you saying?

611
00:32:06,333 --> 00:32:08,750
Everything else is fine,

612
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:12,583
but, we forgot to tell you one thing.

613
00:32:13,083 --> 00:32:16,208
Don't worry... we don't want anything.

614
00:32:16,708 --> 00:32:24,708
We just want you to welcome
the guests with 'Pan Parag'.

615
00:32:25,416 --> 00:32:26,583
Complete the dialogue!

616
00:32:27,083 --> 00:32:27,291
'Pan Parag.'

617
00:32:27,791 --> 00:32:28,791
Ohh, Pan Parag.

618
00:32:29,125 --> 00:32:31,833
We didn't know... - Even
you like Pan Parag.

619
00:32:32,333 --> 00:32:34,208
even you like Pan Parag.

620
00:32:34,708 --> 00:32:36,188
You'll have to excuse me... - Yeah...

621
00:32:36,416 --> 00:32:37,936
But, since the time my son was born...

622
00:32:37,958 --> 00:32:44,541
I always had this desire to
say this 'line' to his in-laws.

623
00:32:45,041 --> 00:32:46,791
Actually, he's got a very jolly nature.

624
00:32:47,291 --> 00:32:49,416
In fact, you should see him
after he's had one peg.

625
00:32:49,916 --> 00:32:52,458
Your wife remembers Shammi sir's
dialogues, but you don't.

626
00:32:52,958 --> 00:32:53,958
That's not the case.

627
00:32:54,166 --> 00:32:56,791
You see, I am a big fan of Shammi sir.

628
00:32:57,291 --> 00:32:58,791
What an amazing guy.

629
00:32:59,291 --> 00:33:01,666
He still looks fantastic at this age.
- No, not anymore.

630
00:33:02,166 --> 00:33:03,875
Why not? - He passed away.

631
00:33:04,375 --> 00:33:05,875
No-no... - Yes.

632
00:33:06,375 --> 00:33:08,176
It's been more than a year or two.
- No-no...

633
00:33:08,583 --> 00:33:11,000
No... it's been almost 8-9 years. - Really?

634
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,541
Strange, nobody told me.

635
00:33:14,041 --> 00:33:16,000
What is this? - It's a holy string.

636
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,291
I think someone's jinxed us.

637
00:33:18,791 --> 00:33:21,791
What do you mean? We've just met!

638
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:22,791
What do you think?

639
00:33:23,291 --> 00:33:26,791
Do you think I believe in these things?

640
00:33:28,958 --> 00:33:32,458
Shall we try again?

641
00:33:34,958 --> 00:33:37,791
Mudit... please don't do this.

642
00:33:38,291 --> 00:33:39,583
You can't be so formal.

643
00:33:40,083 --> 00:33:43,583
We'll have to do it someday.

644
00:33:45,666 --> 00:33:48,583
Practice makes a man perfect

645
00:33:49,083 --> 00:33:51,523
With practice you can overcome
even the most impossible task.

646
00:33:51,958 --> 00:33:55,875
Oo.. love birds!

647
00:33:56,375 --> 00:33:57,375
Come...

648
00:33:57,666 --> 00:33:58,666
You see that roof...

649
00:33:59,083 --> 00:34:00,208
I'll get it extended.

650
00:34:00,708 --> 00:34:04,416
These yellow flowers are my favorite.
- And attach a toilet to it.

651
00:34:04,916 --> 00:34:06,156
If you extend the roof, then...

652
00:34:06,625 --> 00:34:07,666
where will your wife dry the clothes?

653
00:34:08,166 --> 00:34:09,583
You don't worry...

654
00:34:10,083 --> 00:34:14,166
Children these days hate to see
undergarments hanging in the open.

655
00:34:14,666 --> 00:34:16,166
So this will be the dry area.

656
00:34:16,666 --> 00:34:17,750
Full technology.

657
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:18,625
Pulley system.

658
00:34:19,125 --> 00:34:21,625
Pulley down, underwear up.

659
00:34:22,125 --> 00:34:23,458
No one's watching.

660
00:34:23,958 --> 00:34:25,250
Pulley up, underwear down.

661
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:26,791
It's dry, wear them.

662
00:34:27,291 --> 00:34:28,541
That's really nice.

663
00:34:29,041 --> 00:34:31,041
Did you talk to your mom?

664
00:34:31,541 --> 00:34:33,541
Fine, what about your father?

665
00:34:34,041 --> 00:34:35,041
Tyagi? Duggal?

666
00:34:35,333 --> 00:34:36,041
You must have talked to someone, Mudit?

667
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:40,791
Am I becoming a father that I
go around telling everyone?

668
00:34:41,291 --> 00:34:42,750
Don't create a scene out here.

669
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:44,250
I'll fix my problem.

670
00:34:44,333 --> 00:34:44,458
I just wasn't in the mood...

671
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:46,358
The place wasn't right, I guess....

672
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:47,936
What? - I said, the place wasn't right.

673
00:34:48,375 --> 00:34:50,583
What the f...

674
00:34:51,083 --> 00:34:52,083
Sorry. Sorry...

675
00:34:52,583 --> 00:34:53,000
Sorry!

676
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,666
How many times are you going to say sorry?

677
00:34:55,166 --> 00:34:56,208
How many times are you going to say sorry?

678
00:34:56,708 --> 00:34:57,708
Today it's the place.

679
00:34:58,125 --> 00:34:59,845
Tomorrow you'll say the problem is with me.

680
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:02,708
Fantastic, Mudit. - Brother,
is there a problem?

681
00:35:03,208 --> 00:35:04,791
Mind your own business, you bloody...

682
00:35:05,291 --> 00:35:06,291
I'll make you fool!

683
00:35:06,625 --> 00:35:07,833
Sorry... - When you finally
solve your problem...

684
00:35:08,333 --> 00:35:08,791
Are you listening?

685
00:35:09,291 --> 00:35:10,583
Then you can text me, okay?

686
00:35:11,083 --> 00:35:14,875
And by the way, Yours is
a pathetic neighborhood.

687
00:35:15,375 --> 00:35:16,541
Pull... Pull..Pull.

688
00:35:17,041 --> 00:35:18,041
Bless you, dear.

689
00:35:18,375 --> 00:35:21,250
Good.

690
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:24,166
Bless you.

691
00:35:24,666 --> 00:35:28,166
Yes go.

692
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:38,541
What is your problem if the
wedding happens in Haridwar?

693
00:35:39,041 --> 00:35:40,875
Destination weddings are the new trend.

694
00:35:41,375 --> 00:35:42,655
We'll have fewer wedding guests.

695
00:35:43,041 --> 00:35:44,000
And those who attend the wedding,
can take a holy dip in the Ganges.

696
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,140
I don't want any favours from my brother.

697
00:35:46,541 --> 00:35:47,833
This is not a favour.

698
00:35:48,333 --> 00:35:50,534
Didn't their son Golu come
over for his entrance exams?

699
00:35:50,791 --> 00:35:52,291
I even washed his dirty clothes.

700
00:35:52,791 --> 00:35:54,125
And, even we have a right
to that family house.

701
00:35:54,625 --> 00:35:56,416
Mom, please let me watch TV.

702
00:35:56,916 --> 00:35:57,916
"Yes Mummy"

703
00:35:58,041 --> 00:35:59,666
He only scored 40 marks in Maths,

704
00:36:00,166 --> 00:36:00,791
and busy watching television.

705
00:36:01,291 --> 00:36:01,958
Someone give him a tight slap. - So what?

706
00:36:02,458 --> 00:36:04,166
What did I achieve by scoring 70, mom?

707
00:36:04,666 --> 00:36:05,541
We don't have a parking space outside...

708
00:36:06,041 --> 00:36:07,041
but, I still remember
the Pythagoras theorem.

709
00:36:07,541 --> 00:36:08,333
I haven't got a single
promotion at office...

710
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:10,593
but, I still remember
my Algebra lessons.

711
00:36:10,625 --> 00:36:12,458
Instead of making us
by-heart our lessons...

712
00:36:12,958 --> 00:36:15,278
they should've taught us how
to solve problems in life.

713
00:36:15,416 --> 00:36:18,916
Where's my bloody fruit bar?

714
00:36:21,125 --> 00:36:22,541
Amazing, sister! - Shut up.

715
00:36:23,041 --> 00:36:24,750
Shut up... stupid.

716
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:28,750
Fool!

717
00:36:30,541 --> 00:36:32,750
I'll talk to her tonight.

718
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:39,000
"He then kissed my wet lips."

719
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:45,916
"Like rain drops falling
on a parched land."

720
00:36:46,416 --> 00:36:46,666
"That night..."

721
00:36:47,166 --> 00:36:48,458
Sshhhhh.

722
00:36:48,958 --> 00:36:51,358
You know Dolly aunty's driver
is always standing downstairs.

723
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:52,375
Talk softly!

724
00:36:52,416 --> 00:36:54,208
"I still remember that night."

725
00:36:54,708 --> 00:36:56,875
"I was completely overwhelmed..."

726
00:36:57,375 --> 00:37:00,875
"...when his arrow pierced my heart,

727
00:37:01,375 --> 00:37:05,541
which had been lonely for a long time."

728
00:37:06,041 --> 00:37:08,875
I wrote this on my wedding night.

729
00:37:09,375 --> 00:37:12,166
Your father was very gentle.

730
00:37:12,666 --> 00:37:14,541
In fact, he was too gentle. - Yuck, mom.

731
00:37:15,041 --> 00:37:16,583
I don't want to hear your story.

732
00:37:17,083 --> 00:37:17,583
Please, leave.

733
00:37:18,083 --> 00:37:18,708
Ginny will be here any minute.

734
00:37:19,208 --> 00:37:20,728
You'll find a thousand more Ginny's...

735
00:37:20,833 --> 00:37:21,993
But, you've got only one mom!

736
00:37:22,208 --> 00:37:23,769
I'm giving you this lifelong education,

737
00:37:24,291 --> 00:37:25,491
You can't even say 'relation'.

738
00:37:25,958 --> 00:37:28,208
What will you teach me?

739
00:37:28,708 --> 00:37:29,708
How do you say it?

740
00:37:30,083 --> 00:37:33,125
Look, Sugu, you...

741
00:37:33,625 --> 00:37:35,385
You don't understand
what I'm trying to say.

742
00:37:35,833 --> 00:37:36,208
You see, dear...

743
00:37:36,708 --> 00:37:43,166
A woman's body is a secret treasure.

744
00:37:43,666 --> 00:37:45,458
And, it stays in a closed cave.

745
00:37:45,958 --> 00:37:48,000
And, do you know when it opens?

746
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:49,980
When someone says 'open sesame', mom.

747
00:37:50,166 --> 00:37:51,166
No-no-no...

748
00:37:51,208 --> 00:37:52,608
It opens only on the wedding night.

749
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:53,791
And, it doesn't open for the forty thieves,

750
00:37:54,291 --> 00:37:55,875
only for Ali Baba.

751
00:37:56,375 --> 00:37:58,833
And, what if Ali Baba doesn't
make it to the caves?

752
00:37:59,333 --> 00:38:00,934
Why won't Ali Baba make it to the caves?

753
00:38:00,958 --> 00:38:04,333
He was born to reach the cave.

754
00:38:04,833 --> 00:38:05,958
He will... - Mom.

755
00:38:06,458 --> 00:38:09,041
Ali Baba needs these lessons, not the cave.

756
00:38:09,541 --> 00:38:10,000
Understand.

757
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,083
Please leave. - But, dear...

758
00:38:11,583 --> 00:38:12,583
Please, go.

759
00:38:12,833 --> 00:38:13,083
Mom, please.

760
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:13,875
Ginny's here, now please leave.

761
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:15,375
Look, dear... - Get up.

762
00:38:15,541 --> 00:38:18,041
Ali Baba is... - I said leave.

763
00:38:18,541 --> 00:38:20,208
Hello, aunty... - I said go.

764
00:38:20,708 --> 00:38:24,625
Listen to me, dear. - No!

765
00:38:25,125 --> 00:38:27,708
Why won't Ali Baba make it to the caves?

766
00:38:28,208 --> 00:38:29,833
Yuck...

767
00:38:30,333 --> 00:38:31,875
Look at you...

768
00:38:32,375 --> 00:38:33,750
Your attitude's changed
right before the wedding.

769
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:36,916
Oh really... you think
my attitude has changed?

770
00:38:37,416 --> 00:38:37,875
Nothing is happening...

771
00:38:38,375 --> 00:38:39,895
And you think my attitude has changed.

772
00:38:40,166 --> 00:38:42,916
Why?

773
00:38:43,416 --> 00:38:46,125
Ginny, Mudit's got a big problem? - AIDS?

774
00:38:46,625 --> 00:38:47,625
Are you crazy?

775
00:38:48,041 --> 00:38:49,041
AIDS?

776
00:38:49,125 --> 00:38:50,458
I hope not...

777
00:38:50,958 --> 00:38:54,458
Gent's problem.

778
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:56,958
And, he told you.

779
00:38:57,208 --> 00:38:58,250
He tried.

780
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:00,125
But poor guy couldn't tell me.

781
00:39:00,625 --> 00:39:01,625
But, I understood.

782
00:39:01,958 --> 00:39:04,541
And I think he knows that I understood.

783
00:39:05,041 --> 00:39:06,416
What are you trying to say?

784
00:39:06,916 --> 00:39:10,416
How do I explain this to you?

785
00:39:19,625 --> 00:39:21,250
Sorry, guys, I am late.

786
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:22,916
I had to deliver a mobile.

787
00:39:23,416 --> 00:39:26,916
My father always spoil my plans.

788
00:39:28,791 --> 00:39:29,791
What happened?

789
00:39:29,875 --> 00:39:31,708
Duggal... there's a big problem. - What?

790
00:39:32,208 --> 00:39:34,416
His little bro... - Little bro? Who?

791
00:39:34,916 --> 00:39:36,000
Yes.

792
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,291
When? - Yesterday.

793
00:39:38,791 --> 00:39:41,708
Oh.

794
00:39:42,208 --> 00:39:42,583
Where? Ring Road?

795
00:39:43,083 --> 00:39:43,416
Are you crazy?

796
00:39:43,916 --> 00:39:45,000
At sister-in-law's home.
- Sister-in-law's home?

797
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,750
How? - Do I have to tell you everything?

798
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:52,625
Sorry, man.

799
00:39:53,125 --> 00:39:57,583
Tell me something...

800
00:39:58,083 --> 00:39:59,541
When is the funeral?

801
00:40:00,041 --> 00:40:02,583
Sugu... - Hmmm...

802
00:40:03,083 --> 00:40:03,583
I may never be able to eat

803
00:40:04,083 --> 00:40:05,916
another biscuit all my life.

804
00:40:06,416 --> 00:40:08,000
Ginny... I am fooled here

805
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:09,208
and, you're wandering off on your own trip.

806
00:40:09,708 --> 00:40:11,541
No...

807
00:40:12,041 --> 00:40:13,625
Plus, Mudit's track is stuck in a loop.

808
00:40:14,125 --> 00:40:15,365
"It's my problem, I'll do this.

809
00:40:15,708 --> 00:40:17,125
It's my problem, I'll do that."

810
00:40:17,625 --> 00:40:18,041
"Me... Me... Me..."

811
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:22,041
Do you really think you're responsible
for his problem? - I didn't say that.

812
00:40:28,958 --> 00:40:30,875
You don't need your mother's advice.

813
00:40:31,375 --> 00:40:33,375
You need something else. - Ginny...

814
00:40:33,875 --> 00:40:35,035
I'll get it tomorrow. - What?

815
00:40:35,125 --> 00:40:36,125
I'll get it tomorrow!

816
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:36,375
What?

817
00:40:36,875 --> 00:40:40,375
Ginny...

818
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:46,041
'Come to me Danny boy'

819
00:40:46,541 --> 00:40:49,541
'I am waiting to do things to you'

820
00:40:50,041 --> 00:40:53,125
'You can't even imagine.'

821
00:40:53,625 --> 00:40:54,625
'Come to me'

822
00:40:54,875 --> 00:40:57,291
Who is she calling? - Must be her husband.

823
00:40:57,791 --> 00:41:02,291
You won't find subtitles for these films!

824
00:41:02,791 --> 00:41:05,916
What is her problem?

825
00:41:06,416 --> 00:41:07,416
You know what, let it be.

826
00:41:07,791 --> 00:41:08,791
You're going to end up...

827
00:41:08,875 --> 00:41:10,515
just like Preeto from my neighborhood.

828
00:41:10,541 --> 00:41:12,458
She came back home 2
weeks after her wedding.

829
00:41:12,958 --> 00:41:13,458
Divorce...

830
00:41:13,958 --> 00:41:15,375
Nagging mother-in-law,
arguments with the husband...

831
00:41:15,875 --> 00:41:16,875
It was none of the above.

832
00:41:17,125 --> 00:41:18,958
Do you know what the real reason was?
- What?

833
00:41:19,458 --> 00:41:23,375
Relation.

834
00:41:23,875 --> 00:41:25,916
Same problem? - How would I know?

835
00:41:26,416 --> 00:41:28,000
I am untouched by hand myself.

836
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,583
You were my last hope.

837
00:41:30,083 --> 00:41:32,208
But, guys these days have lost their plot.

838
00:41:32,708 --> 00:41:33,908
They all look like buffoons...

839
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:36,041
but fancy about hotties
like Katrina Kaif.

840
00:41:36,541 --> 00:41:38,166
And, curse these beautiful sirens too.

841
00:41:38,666 --> 00:41:40,066
They grind the pole and walk way...

842
00:41:40,375 --> 00:41:42,458
and the pressure is on us.

843
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:45,916
We middle-class girls have no class at all.

844
00:41:46,416 --> 00:41:47,456
And, if you don't do it...

845
00:41:47,541 --> 00:41:49,708
these guys will turn to someone else.

846
00:41:50,208 --> 00:41:53,458
I don't know, Sugu, you deal with this.

847
00:41:53,958 --> 00:41:57,208
And return the CD, it
belongs to my brother.

848
00:41:57,708 --> 00:41:58,458
How many more of these do you have?

849
00:41:58,958 --> 00:41:59,666
Is this why you wanted a laptop?

850
00:42:00,166 --> 00:42:01,291
How many more of you?

851
00:42:01,791 --> 00:42:05,458
Ginny, next time we'll watch
the CD at your home. - Why?

852
00:42:05,958 --> 00:42:08,291
Yeah... my brother's getting
beaten up because of me.

853
00:42:08,791 --> 00:42:10,833
You watch such dirty pictures.
- Don't worry.

854
00:42:11,333 --> 00:42:13,416
Soon he'll have his own collection.
- Shut up.

855
00:42:13,916 --> 00:42:17,333
Listen, did you give it a thought...
about the beautiful-siren? - No.

856
00:42:17,833 --> 00:42:19,083
Do you want to become a ruffian
when you grow up? - Not yet.

857
00:42:19,583 --> 00:42:19,750
But, you know what...

858
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:22,625
I am going to buy my wedding
dress with mom. - Hurry up.

859
00:42:23,125 --> 00:42:25,458
Or we'll miss the Metro.
- I'll call you later.

860
00:42:25,958 --> 00:42:26,416
Then, how did I find this CD in your bag?

861
00:42:26,916 --> 00:42:27,916
Coming.

862
00:42:28,333 --> 00:42:29,750
Teach him a good lesson today.

863
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:31,690
I am going to break his skull today.

864
00:42:31,708 --> 00:42:32,458
I've made some turmeric milk for him.

865
00:42:32,958 --> 00:42:34,559
Use an antiseptic if he starts to bleed.

866
00:42:34,791 --> 00:42:35,872
First take his laptop away.

867
00:42:36,166 --> 00:42:38,041
The cotton is kept with my nail polishes.

868
00:42:38,541 --> 00:42:42,041
Useless...

869
00:42:51,166 --> 00:42:54,208
"He called me 'honey' and
jumped to honeymoon."

870
00:42:54,708 --> 00:42:57,625
"While I was planning for January
he was planning for June."

871
00:42:58,125 --> 00:43:01,208
"He has made calculations my beloved!"

872
00:43:01,708 --> 00:43:04,458
"He has such velocity he
rises like a fountain."

873
00:43:04,958 --> 00:43:09,250
"My beloved is a rocket"

874
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:11,416
Pinky was wearing such a nice dress.

875
00:43:11,916 --> 00:43:12,916
What is this place?

876
00:43:13,333 --> 00:43:15,134
You said we're going to
buy my wedding dress.

877
00:43:15,458 --> 00:43:17,125
L-for 'Lehenga' (Dress), L-for Lingerie.

878
00:43:17,625 --> 00:43:18,750
And, you're going to wear
the dress for only one day.

879
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:20,250
This is the real deal.

880
00:43:20,291 --> 00:43:20,750
Come on. - No.

881
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:21,708
What are you doing? - No, mom.

882
00:43:22,208 --> 00:43:23,208
Come on. - Mom...

883
00:43:23,416 --> 00:43:23,875
Don't be so rude.

884
00:43:24,375 --> 00:43:25,976
I've told you a dozen times don't do it.

885
00:43:26,166 --> 00:43:28,458
Mister... - Madam... madam.

886
00:43:28,958 --> 00:43:29,958
Hello, madam.

887
00:43:30,083 --> 00:43:31,123
So, what can I do for you?

888
00:43:31,125 --> 00:43:32,125
New stock for nightwear has just arrived.

889
00:43:32,625 --> 00:43:34,745
Well, I am not looking For
anything for myself today.

890
00:43:35,125 --> 00:43:36,125

rises like a fountain."

907

Bangali baba.

913
00:44:35,791 --> 00:44:39,291
He can't even stand straight

914
00:44:44,875 --> 00:44:46,083
"Rocket."

915
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:50,083
"Beloved beloved"

916
00:44:51,708 --> 00:44:52,958

00:44:53,458 --> 00:44:54,750
"Beloved beloved"

918
00:44:55,250 --> 00:44:57,458

00:44:57,958 --> 00:45:01,250
"Beloved beloved"

920
00:45:01,750 --> 00:45:02,916
Now that's a real man!

921
00:45:03,416 --> 00:45:07,458
He makes them fool!

922
00:45:07,958 --> 00:45:10,041
"My beloved is a rocket"

923
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:12,041

924

00:45:17,458 --> 00:45:18,958
"Beloved beloved beloved beloved"

927
00:45:19,458 --> 00:45:20,898
"My beloved is a rocket" - Listen...

928
00:45:21,166 --> 00:45:21,458
I've got some plums.

929
00:45:21,958 --> 00:45:23,291
I hope these are enough. - Yeah.

930
00:45:23,791 --> 00:45:24,916
Is he coming? - Yes.

931
00:45:25,416 --> 00:45:26,833
See you... - Let's go, brother.

932
00:45:27,333 --> 00:45:30,833
Okay... - Bye.

933
00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:36,750
How did you suddenly think
about going for a picnic?

934
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:42,541
Awesome speakers.

935
00:45:43,041 --> 00:45:46,000
How much did you pay for it? - 2000.

936
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:46,791
You've been duped.

937
00:45:47,291 --> 00:45:47,625
Why didn't you tell me?

938
00:45:48,125 --> 00:45:49,325
I would've got it for cheaper.

939
00:45:49,333 --> 00:45:51,333
Have you been answering my calls?

940
00:45:51,833 --> 00:45:53,291
"You've been duped."

941
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:55,125
Men are dogs.

942
00:45:55,625 --> 00:45:57,416
They only know how to mark their area.

943
00:45:57,916 --> 00:45:58,916
You were chasing me.

944
00:45:59,375 --> 00:46:02,875
And, once I said yes...
- That's not it, Sugu...

945
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:16,250
Don't you have another song?

946
00:46:28,833 --> 00:46:31,875
What happened? - It's sour.

947
00:46:32,375 --> 00:46:35,875
Then, why are you eating them?
- Stay back...

948
00:46:47,125 --> 00:46:48,125
What... what...

949
00:46:48,416 --> 00:46:51,916
Zip it up, please.

950
00:46:54,375 --> 00:46:57,875
Come to me, Danny boy!

951
00:47:00,875 --> 00:47:04,000
I am waiting for you, Danny boy!

952
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:08,000
I am waiting to do things to you.

953
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:12,000
You can't even imagine...

954
00:47:14,375 --> 00:47:17,875
Come to me.

955
00:47:33,972 --> 00:47:35,892
Brother, just drop her to
the Modi Garden bridge

956
00:47:35,916 --> 00:47:39,416
Okay, get in.

957
00:47:41,041 --> 00:47:42,250
Mudit...

958
00:47:42,750 --> 00:47:45,958
You know what, Mudit...
we won't have relation.

959
00:47:46,458 --> 00:47:48,000
There's life without relation as well.

960
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:49,750
We'll try different things.

961
00:47:50,250 --> 00:47:51,970
Like we'll go out... we'll go sight-seeing.

962
00:47:52,333 --> 00:47:52,833
Yoga...

963
00:47:53,333 --> 00:47:54,333
We'll try Yoga, Mudit.

964
00:47:54,541 --> 00:47:58,041
I...

965
00:47:59,375 --> 00:48:03,000
I am being negative again.

966
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:06,416
You'll get better, won't you?

967
00:48:06,916 --> 00:48:08,625
Isn't it?

968
00:48:09,125 --> 00:48:11,208
And anyway, we'll be going
to Haridwar tomorrow.

969
00:48:11,708 --> 00:48:16,541
And, you will arrive
with the wedding-guests.

970
00:48:17,041 --> 00:48:18,041
Please take her...

971
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:22,000
And drive carefully. - Yes.

972
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:39,791
Dance, uncle... dance...

973
00:48:40,291 --> 00:48:41,375
Ravinder. - Yes, uncle.

974
00:48:41,875 --> 00:48:42,791
How much Frooti are we supposed to drink?

975
00:48:43,291 --> 00:48:44,791
Please don't complain.

976
00:48:45,291 --> 00:48:45,791
Just a minute, uncle.

977
00:48:46,291 --> 00:48:46,791
Children are dancing outside,

978
00:48:47,291 --> 00:48:47,625
How can we ask them to stop?

979
00:48:48,125 --> 00:48:49,165
Move.. get out of the way!

980
00:48:49,375 --> 00:48:50,541
It's my brother's wedding...

981
00:48:51,041 --> 00:48:52,041
Listen, Gannu - Yeah.

982
00:48:52,375 --> 00:48:53,333
Are they dancing, or have
they been possessed?

983
00:48:53,833 --> 00:48:54,333
They are just having fun.

984
00:48:54,833 --> 00:48:55,791
Why don't you dance too? - What dance?

985
00:48:56,291 --> 00:48:59,791
Where is Mudit? - Mudit
hasn't returned yet.

986
00:49:03,291 --> 00:49:06,833
Shouldn't you be on the bus
along with the wedding guests?

987
00:49:07,333 --> 00:49:12,833
Yeah... I... wanted to talk to you.

988
00:49:13,333 --> 00:49:17,291
I've lied to my parents, Mudit.

989
00:49:17,791 --> 00:49:19,311
We must reach Haridwar before evening.

990
00:49:19,375 --> 00:49:21,416
Uncle has arranged for
a big prayer ceremony.

991
00:49:21,916 --> 00:49:27,666
The wedding guests must attend it too.
- Hmmm... the wedding guest?

992
00:49:28,166 --> 00:49:30,875
Coffee?

993
00:49:31,375 --> 00:49:34,833
Sugu, this tensed face
doesn't suit you at all.

994
00:49:35,333 --> 00:49:37,416
And, when the reason is me.

995
00:49:37,916 --> 00:49:38,250
This is a genuine problem...

996
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:39,000
I can't solve it.

997
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:43,000
I can't get better.

998
00:49:45,125 --> 00:49:49,208
So I thought... let's cancel the wedding.

999
00:49:49,708 --> 00:49:53,208
I won't be able to keep you happy.

1000
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:04,000
Order some coffee.

1001
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:06,940
Shake a leg, fatso. - What happened?

1002
00:50:07,291 --> 00:50:08,416
Do you want this wedding
to take place without him?

1003
00:50:08,916 --> 00:50:10,708
Let's first ask Mudit whether
he wants to get married or not.

1004
00:50:11,208 --> 00:50:14,000
Tell me, uncle, doesn't a father
have a right to hit his kid?

1005
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:16,416
Calm down, son. Calm down.
- What calm down?

1006
00:50:16,916 --> 00:50:18,791
That fool is taking revenge on his father.

1007
00:50:19,291 --> 00:50:21,333
Where is he, I...

1008
00:50:21,833 --> 00:50:24,291
Bro, shall we down one each...

1009
00:50:24,791 --> 00:50:26,208
Sir, two cappuccinos.

1010
00:50:26,708 --> 00:50:30,208
But, I don't want the cappuccino.

1011
00:50:31,916 --> 00:50:35,041
Did you ask about my decision
before placing your order?

1012
00:50:35,541 --> 00:50:38,583
Take it away. - No, mister, stay here.

1013
00:50:39,083 --> 00:50:40,483
He might have made up his mind, but

1014
00:50:40,666 --> 00:50:42,666
I am still thinking.

1015
00:50:43,166 --> 00:50:44,958
First, you stalked me...

1016
00:50:45,458 --> 00:50:48,000
then, you sent an online proposal.

1017
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:51,625
And now you're thinking about
canceling the wedding, Mudit.

1018
00:50:52,125 --> 00:50:53,686
Is this a video game? - Please leave...

1019
00:50:54,166 --> 00:50:57,666
I said wait!

1020
00:51:02,208 --> 00:51:03,625
Stop it! I said stop it!

1021
00:51:04,125 --> 00:51:04,416
Stop it.

1022
00:51:04,916 --> 00:51:06,416
Hey you...

1023
00:51:06,916 --> 00:51:07,291
Here...

1024
00:51:07,791 --> 00:51:08,791
Try playing now.

1025
00:51:08,916 --> 00:51:11,583
Stop it.

1026
00:51:12,083 --> 00:51:13,083
Uncle.

1027
00:51:13,291 --> 00:51:14,291
Where is Mudit?

1028
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:15,500
What does Mudit think?

1029
00:51:15,625 --> 00:51:18,833
This wedding will get canceled without him?

1030
00:51:19,333 --> 00:51:23,458
This procession will leave...
and we'll all go without Mudit.

1031
00:51:23,958 --> 00:51:25,279
Come on, everyone get on the bus.

1032
00:51:25,541 --> 00:51:27,916
What if you were facing the
same problem after the wedding?

1033
00:51:28,416 --> 00:51:30,176
What if I had a problem
after the wedding...

1034
00:51:30,291 --> 00:51:31,372
would you have run away?

1035
00:51:31,791 --> 00:51:34,432
One black coffee, one cold coffee,
one lemon tea, one green tea...

1036
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:35,208
Get everything on the menu, and get lost.

1037
00:51:35,708 --> 00:51:35,875
Clear this out.

1038
00:51:36,375 --> 00:51:39,875
Get out.

1039
00:51:41,125 --> 00:51:47,458
Marrying you was my first decision
which I took independently.

1040
00:51:47,958 --> 00:51:51,458
I'll go to Haridwar and wait
for your procession to arrive.

1041
00:51:56,416 --> 00:51:57,416
Sugu...

1042
00:51:57,458 --> 00:52:00,958
Sugu...

1043
00:52:06,541 --> 00:52:07,791
Dance... Bro..

1044
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:11,125
Phone.

1045
00:52:11,625 --> 00:52:12,625
Mudit. Hello...

1046
00:52:12,791 --> 00:52:17,916
You guys get on, I'll board the
bus at the Ring Road signal.

1047
00:52:18,416 --> 00:52:18,791
The wedding procession is leaving,

1048
00:52:19,291 --> 00:52:19,291
let's go, fatso.

1049
00:52:19,791 --> 00:52:22,291
Hurry up.

1050
00:52:22,791 --> 00:52:26,291
Come on, hold my hand. Hurry up.

1051
00:52:29,083 --> 00:52:30,083
Stop the bus.

1052
00:52:30,125 --> 00:52:31,333
Stop the bus.

1053
00:52:31,833 --> 00:52:34,791
Stop the bus.

1054
00:52:35,291 --> 00:52:36,458
Mudit's back. - Hello.

1055
00:52:36,958 --> 00:52:37,958
Mudit's back.

1056
00:52:38,458 --> 00:52:40,958
Mudit come.

1057
00:52:41,458 --> 00:52:44,958
Where were you?

1058
00:52:57,083 --> 00:52:58,208
O benevolent Goddess...

1059
00:52:58,708 --> 00:53:01,958
We're going to shoot
Sugandha's wedding video.

1060
00:53:02,458 --> 00:53:04,625
Bless us with Your grace.

1061
00:53:05,125 --> 00:53:07,916
I am sure this video will take me places.

1062
00:53:08,416 --> 00:53:11,916
Hail, Goddess!

1063
00:53:20,125 --> 00:53:21,666
Stop stop stop. - Hello.

1064
00:53:22,166 --> 00:53:23,166
Bring some water.

1065
00:53:23,666 --> 00:53:24,666
Hello.

1066
00:53:24,750 --> 00:53:26,541
Brother! - Yes, brother.

1067
00:53:27,041 --> 00:53:29,125
What took you so long?

1068
00:53:29,625 --> 00:53:31,145
The veneration has started. - So what?

1069
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:34,250
Look, I spared no expenses.
- Brother, we just got here.

1070
00:53:34,750 --> 00:53:36,111
Let's not talk about expenses now.

1071
00:53:36,375 --> 00:53:37,541
Sugu's been crying throughout the journey.

1072
00:53:38,041 --> 00:53:39,041
She just stopped.

1073
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:40,250
What happened?

1074
00:53:40,375 --> 00:53:41,375
I'll be back in a minute.

1075
00:53:41,416 --> 00:53:42,416
Turn it up.

1076
00:53:42,541 --> 00:53:43,791
Are you okay?

1077
00:53:44,291 --> 00:53:44,750
Dear - Sugu.

1078
00:53:45,250 --> 00:53:48,833
Hey Sugu...

1079
00:53:49,333 --> 00:53:50,833
I'm noticing. - What?

1080
00:53:51,333 --> 00:53:52,973
I'm noticing everything. - What happened?

1081
00:53:53,166 --> 00:53:55,833
No one touched my feet. - I...

1082
00:53:56,333 --> 00:53:58,013
Bro, she had to use the washroom urgently.

1083
00:53:58,375 --> 00:53:59,895
We didn't stop anywhere for two hours.

1084
00:53:59,958 --> 00:54:01,833
Will you forget your values for a washroom?

1085
00:54:02,333 --> 00:54:04,134
Do you know how much I
spent on these lights?

1086
00:54:04,208 --> 00:54:05,250
Wait a minute, brother.

1087
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:08,833
This is one's from me,
this one from Sugu...

1088
00:54:09,333 --> 00:54:10,493
and this one's from Vimla.

1089
00:54:10,583 --> 00:54:13,041
One for me as well, papa...
I can't stop playing.

1090
00:54:13,541 --> 00:54:14,875
Fool...

1091
00:54:15,375 --> 00:54:18,875
Hail Goddess...

1092
00:54:20,750 --> 00:54:24,291
Reminds me of our father. - Oh, brother.

1093
00:54:24,791 --> 00:54:26,083
It's alright.

1094
00:54:26,583 --> 00:54:27,983
Don't forget to give him a beating.

1095
00:54:28,333 --> 00:54:29,666
It will make our father happy.

1096
00:54:30,166 --> 00:54:31,166
Hail Goddess...

1097
00:54:31,541 --> 00:54:35,041
One... two... three... Start!

1098
00:54:39,208 --> 00:54:41,291
"My mother went up the hill"

1099
00:54:41,791 --> 00:54:43,333
"Riding on a tiger"

1100
00:54:43,833 --> 00:54:47,750
"Calling all her kids"

1101
00:54:48,250 --> 00:54:50,166
"People here are aplenty"

1102
00:54:50,666 --> 00:54:52,375
"Coming from far lands"

1103
00:54:52,875 --> 00:54:56,958
"She's greeting all of them"

1104
00:54:57,458 --> 00:54:59,250
"She blesses"

1105
00:54:59,750 --> 00:55:01,833
"She gives sweets"

1106
00:55:02,333 --> 00:55:05,750
"To whoever is a true follower"

1107
00:55:06,250 --> 00:55:08,750
"Oh mother, in your blessing"

1108
00:55:09,250 --> 00:55:10,250
"Is the strength"

1109
00:55:10,708 --> 00:55:13,291
"Oh mother, in your blessing"

1110
00:55:13,791 --> 00:55:15,208
"Is the strength"

1111
00:55:15,708 --> 00:55:17,208
"She speaks so sweetly"

1112
00:55:17,708 --> 00:55:19,583
"that even when she orders tomatoes"

1113
00:55:20,083 --> 00:55:23,583
"it feels like she's reciting poetries."

1114
00:55:29,208 --> 00:55:30,916
"Her eyes are so pretty"

1115
00:55:31,416 --> 00:55:33,000
"that whenever our eyes meet"

1116
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:39,833
"I lose control of my sight and thoughts."

1117
00:55:40,333 --> 00:55:40,791
"But"

1118
00:55:41,291 --> 00:55:42,958
"As soon as the love arose"

1119
00:55:43,458 --> 00:55:45,250
"a dagger went through my chest"

1120
00:55:45,750 --> 00:55:48,958
"My heart got funked."

1121
00:55:49,458 --> 00:55:52,125
"When dust settled"

1122
00:55:52,625 --> 00:55:54,375
"my dreams shattered"

1123
00:55:54,875 --> 00:55:58,375
"My heart got funked."

1124
00:56:06,333 --> 00:56:09,375
"Got fooled so bad"

1125
00:56:09,875 --> 00:56:14,958
"my emotions turned into juice."

1126
00:56:15,458 --> 00:56:18,791
"Decorated my house with lights"

1127
00:56:19,291 --> 00:56:22,958
"but connection was loose."

1128
00:56:23,458 --> 00:56:24,666
Hello.

1129
00:56:25,166 --> 00:56:25,250
Who is this?

1130
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:27,250
This is your well-wisher speaking.

1131
00:56:27,750 --> 00:56:31,458
I know all about your 'gents' problem.

1132
00:56:31,958 --> 00:56:34,375
Stop calling me and bothering me. - Mudit.

1133
00:56:34,875 --> 00:56:37,125
I'll beat you to a pulp, understand.
- Mudit.

1134
00:56:37,625 --> 00:56:40,000
My mom's close-by, otherwise
I would've abused you.

1135
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:42,333
"Roads have such potholes"

1136
00:56:42,833 --> 00:56:44,708
"fractured my heart's bones."

1137
00:56:45,208 --> 00:56:48,708
"My heart got funked."

1138
00:57:12,708 --> 00:57:14,375
Congratulations.

1139
00:57:14,875 --> 00:57:15,250
Are you going to kiss me too?

1140
00:57:15,750 --> 00:57:19,250
Congratulations.

1141
00:57:21,851 --> 00:57:22,851
Stop it.

1142
00:57:22,875 --> 00:57:23,208
What are you doing?

1143
00:57:23,708 --> 00:57:24,166
That's the driver.

1144
00:57:24,666 --> 00:57:25,625
You can't just kiss anyone.
- He's still a human being.

1145
00:57:26,125 --> 00:57:27,958
Where is son-in-law? - Where's the groom?

1146
00:57:28,458 --> 00:57:33,083
Sugandha, did the groom run away?
- He'll be here.

1147
00:57:33,583 --> 00:57:37,083
Won't he?

1148
00:57:38,166 --> 00:57:40,367
Come on, let's go down and take a look.
- Yes, come on.

1149
00:57:40,458 --> 00:57:40,958
Sugu, he's here.

1150
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:44,958
Yes come come...

1151
00:57:47,208 --> 00:57:48,291
One dance, sir.

1152
00:57:48,791 --> 00:57:50,708
We'll get a shot of the groom's entrance.

1153
00:57:51,208 --> 00:57:52,708
Sir, one dance. - Get off.

1154
00:57:53,208 --> 00:57:56,833
I don't want to dance.

1155
00:57:57,333 --> 00:57:58,958
Shoo... no need to light the crackers.

1156
00:57:59,767 --> 00:58:00,767
This way, son.

1157
00:58:00,791 --> 00:58:01,166
Hello, uncle.

1158
00:58:01,666 --> 00:58:01,875
Hello. - Hello, uncle.

1159
00:58:02,375 --> 00:58:06,000
Hello. - Hello, uncle.

1160
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:06,666
Come.

1161
00:58:07,166 --> 00:58:08,000
Hello, father. - Bless you, son-in-law.

1162
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:09,791
It's alright.

1163
00:58:10,291 --> 00:58:10,375
It's okay.

1164
00:58:10,875 --> 00:58:12,250
Shall we get on with the veneration then?
- No...

1165
00:58:12,750 --> 00:58:14,208
Hello, uncle. - Bless you, son.

1166
00:58:14,708 --> 00:58:15,916
Come, my boy.

1167
00:58:16,416 --> 00:58:18,125
Take the blessings.

1168
00:58:18,625 --> 00:58:19,916
He's trying to kiss him as well.

1169
00:58:20,416 --> 00:58:21,166
What kind of a man... - No welcome..

1170
00:58:21,666 --> 00:58:23,625
Hello.

1171
00:58:24,125 --> 00:58:26,791
See... he's showing his
true colors already.

1172
00:58:27,291 --> 00:58:32,250
I wish he hadn't shown
up in the first place.

1173
00:58:32,750 --> 00:58:34,166
Sugu...

1174
00:58:34,666 --> 00:58:38,166
Sugu...

1175
00:58:43,458 --> 00:58:44,458
Why the long face?

1176
00:58:44,750 --> 00:58:45,625
Were you planning on not showing up?

1177
00:58:46,125 --> 00:58:46,333
I am right here...

1178
00:58:46,833 --> 00:58:47,833
In flesh...

1179
00:58:48,041 --> 00:58:49,481
I had to sit on the roof of the bus.

1180
00:58:49,583 --> 00:58:49,916
And, why?

1181
00:58:50,416 --> 00:58:53,875
For your uncle's kiss? - You
think you did me a favour?

1182
00:58:54,375 --> 00:58:55,166
There would've been bloodshed in Delhi...

1183
00:58:55,666 --> 00:58:57,746
if the groom refuses to
marry on the wedding day.

1184
00:58:57,958 --> 00:58:59,166
You should be thankful that I
am not like one of them...

1185
00:58:59,666 --> 00:59:00,958
otherwise, you would be
featured on Crime Patrol...

1186
00:59:01,458 --> 00:59:04,958
and not our wedding video.

1187
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:09,208
What do you want?

1188
00:59:09,708 --> 00:59:13,125
Should I keep waiting for my Prince
Charming for the rest of my life?

1189
00:59:13,625 --> 00:59:15,000
Believe me, I tried, Mudit?

1190
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:18,375
But no one ever noticed me in
front of those M-Block girls.

1191
00:59:18,875 --> 00:59:20,875
You're the first guy who liked me,

1192
00:59:21,375 --> 00:59:23,958
who chose me. - Thank you.

1193
00:59:24,458 --> 00:59:26,750
It's not a compliment, you
don't have to say thank you.

1194
00:59:27,250 --> 00:59:28,708
Sorry.

1195
00:59:29,208 --> 00:59:33,791
Mudit... you even fought with a bear
only to strike a conversation with me.

1196
00:59:34,291 --> 00:59:35,291
Thank you.

1197
00:59:35,458 --> 00:59:38,375
Don't let your 'gents' problem
be another bear in your life.

1198
00:59:38,875 --> 00:59:40,208
Sorry.

1199
00:59:40,708 --> 00:59:41,708
Mudit...

1200
00:59:41,791 --> 00:59:44,833
You're the compliment which life gave me.

1201
00:59:45,333 --> 00:59:47,875
Even you're the compliment
which life gave me.

1202
00:59:48,375 --> 00:59:49,916
Then smile, Mudit...

1203
00:59:50,416 --> 00:59:53,916
Laugh... we're getting married.

1204
00:59:59,083 --> 01:00:02,208
Eventually... everything's going
to change after the wedding.

1205
01:00:02,708 --> 01:00:05,375
First, we'll have kids, next
I'll have to quit my job.

1206
01:00:05,875 --> 01:00:09,041
The vegetable-seller will remember
which dress I wore on which day.

1207
01:00:09,541 --> 01:00:11,333
No more goals in life.

1208
01:00:11,833 --> 01:00:13,541
But, the next three days...

1209
01:00:14,041 --> 01:00:15,750
Our wedding...

1210
01:00:16,250 --> 01:00:19,750
It will be the highlight
of our life, Mudit.

1211
01:00:35,541 --> 01:00:38,250
Hello. - This is your well-wisher speaking.

1212
01:00:38,750 --> 01:00:41,083
Once I find this guy, I
will teach him a lesson...

1213
01:00:41,583 --> 01:00:42,583
Who is it? - Don't know.

1214
01:00:42,875 --> 01:00:43,458
Someone's been calling me since last night.

1215
01:00:43,958 --> 01:00:44,375
Says I am your well-wisher.

1216
01:00:44,875 --> 01:00:46,315
I know all about your gents problem.

1217
01:00:46,416 --> 01:00:46,833
Etcetera. Etcetera. -

1218
01:00:47,333 --> 01:00:48,333
Who did you tell, Mudit?

1219
01:00:48,833 --> 01:00:53,041
I am not crazy to tell anyone.

1220
01:00:53,541 --> 01:00:54,791
Give it. - Why... why...

1221
01:00:55,291 --> 01:00:55,541
Why do you want to talk to him?

1222
01:00:56,041 --> 01:00:57,041
Are you crazy?

1223
01:00:57,416 --> 01:00:59,625
Don't you understand, Hindi?

1224
01:01:00,125 --> 01:01:01,333
I am your well-wisher.

1225
01:01:01,833 --> 01:01:03,958
I know all about your gents problem.

1226
01:01:04,458 --> 01:01:05,458
Idiot, fool.

1227
01:01:05,625 --> 01:01:06,625
I am a Delhi-girl.

1228
01:01:06,875 --> 01:01:07,875
You are lucky, my fiance's right here...

1229
01:01:08,375 --> 01:01:09,625
and this can ruin my
reputation, otherwise...

1230
01:01:10,125 --> 01:01:11,845
I would've abused you till you are here!

1231
01:01:12,291 --> 01:01:15,958
If you call back again,
I'll slap you so hard...

1232
01:01:16,458 --> 01:01:19,333
that your children will be born bald.

1233
01:01:19,833 --> 01:01:24,041
Bloody pest... now, hang up!

1234
01:01:24,541 --> 01:01:28,291
Sugu, I already have two children.

1235
01:01:28,791 --> 01:01:32,541
And, they both have hair.

1236
01:01:33,041 --> 01:01:35,375
Papa... - Oh!

1237
01:01:35,875 --> 01:01:36,958
I was only thinking about
your well-being...

1238
01:01:37,458 --> 01:01:39,538
so that even you can have
children in the future.

1239
01:01:39,791 --> 01:01:41,711
I've even thought of names
for my grandchildren.

1240
01:01:42,083 --> 01:01:44,083
But son-in-law problem
has baffled everyone.

1241
01:01:44,583 --> 01:01:46,125
Papa, how do you know?

1242
01:01:46,625 --> 01:01:49,958
When the daughter is tensed for
weeks, comes home crying...

1243
01:01:50,458 --> 01:01:52,791
then her father is forced
to check her whatsapp.

1244
01:01:53,291 --> 01:01:55,666
Can you check whatsapp?

1245
01:01:56,166 --> 01:01:57,727
I even have an account on FB(Facebook),

1246
01:01:58,166 --> 01:01:59,625
but I forgot my password.

1247
01:02:00,125 --> 01:02:01,208
I can't remember whether
it was Glory to Goddess...

1248
01:02:01,708 --> 01:02:02,833
or Goddess, glory to You.

1249
01:02:03,333 --> 01:02:04,250
I think it was Goddess glory to You.

1250
01:02:04,750 --> 01:02:04,833
Doesn't matter...

1251
01:02:05,333 --> 01:02:07,625
Give the phone to son-in-law.

1252
01:02:08,125 --> 01:02:09,125
How did papa find out?

1253
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:13,375
All thanks to Digital India.

1254
01:02:13,875 --> 01:02:15,916
Pa..pa...

1255
01:02:16,416 --> 01:02:18,291
Greetings, Papa. - Forget the formalities.

1256
01:02:18,791 --> 01:02:21,583
And fix the 'little' problem that you have.

1257
01:02:22,083 --> 01:02:23,333
That's no way to talk to
our future son-in-law.

1258
01:02:23,833 --> 01:02:26,541
Future son-in-law, he's
not our son-in-law yet.

1259
01:02:27,041 --> 01:02:28,375
And listen, whenever you're
free in the morning...

1260
01:02:28,875 --> 01:02:30,625
meet me at the city square, alone.

1261
01:02:31,125 --> 01:02:32,833
You'll see many cows grazing out there.

1262
01:02:33,333 --> 01:02:35,093
And, there will be a
brown cow amongst them.

1263
01:02:35,125 --> 01:02:36,125
Wait for me there.

1264
01:02:36,458 --> 01:02:36,958
I'll come see you.

1265
01:02:37,458 --> 01:02:40,083
Now hang up.

1266
01:02:40,583 --> 01:02:42,166
Listen...

1267
01:02:42,666 --> 01:02:44,791
Promise me. - What are you doing?

1268
01:02:45,291 --> 01:02:48,375
You'll help Ali Baba get to the cave.

1269
01:02:48,875 --> 01:02:51,125
You just messed things up.

1270
01:02:51,625 --> 01:02:56,041
Why don't you give a special mention
about my problem on the wedding cards?

1271
01:02:56,541 --> 01:02:58,875
What just happened?

1272
01:02:59,375 --> 01:03:01,958
Someday everyone would've found
out about your problem, Mudit.

1273
01:03:02,458 --> 01:03:03,958
And anyway, you're not doing
anything about your problem.

1274
01:03:04,458 --> 01:03:04,791
What do I do?

1275
01:03:05,291 --> 01:03:06,458
What should I do?

1276
01:03:06,958 --> 01:03:08,083
Can you imagine the
pressure on my shoulders?

1277
01:03:08,583 --> 01:03:11,125
The entire family iss dancing on my head.

1278
01:03:11,625 --> 01:03:11,833
How's daughter-in-law?

1279
01:03:12,333 --> 01:03:12,375
How much does she earn?

1280
01:03:12,875 --> 01:03:13,083
Does she earn more than you?

1281
01:03:13,583 --> 01:03:13,750
How much gold is she bringing along?

1282
01:03:14,250 --> 01:03:15,371
How do I explain it to them?

1283
01:03:15,416 --> 01:03:17,125
What do I do to make them happy?

1284
01:03:17,625 --> 01:03:18,333
Forget them... Let's forget
about them for a minute.

1285
01:03:18,833 --> 01:03:19,833
Let's talk about you.

1286
01:03:20,125 --> 01:03:23,875
What do I do to make you happy?
- I want to be your wife...

1287
01:03:24,375 --> 01:03:26,541
not the duty in your life. Okay.

1288
01:03:27,041 --> 01:03:28,602
If you really cared about me so much...

1289
01:03:28,916 --> 01:03:31,077
then, you would've never
made such a cold entrance.

1290
01:03:31,541 --> 01:03:33,181
Is this how a wedding procession arrives?

1291
01:03:33,291 --> 01:03:34,291
Answer me.

1292
01:03:34,416 --> 01:03:34,833
I won't dance...

1293
01:03:35,333 --> 01:03:35,833
I won't get my picture taken.

1294
01:03:36,333 --> 01:03:37,813
You didn't let uncle kiss you either.

1295
01:03:38,041 --> 01:03:39,081
Why does he kiss everyone?

1296
01:03:39,166 --> 01:03:42,666
Why?

1297
01:03:44,208 --> 01:03:45,208
Even I have relatives.

1298
01:03:45,458 --> 01:03:47,333
I have the same pressure on my shoulders.

1299
01:03:47,833 --> 01:03:49,313
Everyone's been bothering me as well.

1300
01:03:49,333 --> 01:03:49,666
When is brother-in-law arriving?

1301
01:03:50,166 --> 01:03:50,208
Where is brother-in-law?

1302
01:03:50,708 --> 01:03:51,333
Brother-in-law this...
- Brother-in-law that...

1303
01:03:51,833 --> 01:03:52,375
And how did brother-in-law
make an entry?...

1304
01:03:52,875 --> 01:03:56,375
Like a loser...

1305
01:04:06,833 --> 01:04:08,458
Mudit, where are you going?

1306
01:04:08,958 --> 01:04:09,291
Mudit.

1307
01:04:09,791 --> 01:04:10,791
Where are you going?

1308
01:04:11,125 --> 01:04:14,625
Mudit!

1309
01:04:16,767 --> 01:04:17,767
Wake up...

1310
01:04:17,791 --> 01:04:18,791
Wake up, everyone.

1311
01:04:19,250 --> 01:04:21,791
The bride's family is giving
single room to couples with kids.

1312
01:04:22,291 --> 01:04:23,291
10 rooms are available.

1313
01:04:23,541 --> 01:04:24,941
On a first come, first serve basis.

1314
01:04:25,041 --> 01:04:26,208
Come on, uncle... wake up.

1315
01:04:26,708 --> 01:04:26,958
Go on...

1316
01:04:27,458 --> 01:04:28,458
Get on the bus.

1317
01:04:28,583 --> 01:04:29,583
Wake up, quickly.

1318
01:04:29,791 --> 01:04:31,625
We're going on the bus.

1319
01:04:32,125 --> 01:04:33,125
Uncle...

1320
01:04:33,208 --> 01:04:34,208
Wake up.

1321
01:04:34,625 --> 01:04:35,785
The world's coming to an end.

1322
01:04:36,041 --> 01:04:36,125
Come on.

1323
01:04:36,625 --> 01:04:37,250
Uncle, you're the last man standing.

1324
01:04:37,750 --> 01:04:38,333
Uncle, are you taking a shower?

1325
01:04:38,833 --> 01:04:39,833
- Yes, why?

1326
01:04:39,875 --> 01:04:42,458
Don't get scared if you see a
snake inside. - Come out...

1327
01:04:42,958 --> 01:04:45,875
Snake. Snake... - There's a snake in here.

1328
01:04:46,375 --> 01:04:47,541
Come on.

1329
01:04:48,041 --> 01:04:49,333
Uncle, hurry up.

1330
01:04:49,833 --> 01:04:50,833
Is there a towel inside?

1331
01:04:51,041 --> 01:04:51,750
What were you thinking off
at this hour... Shut up.

1332
01:04:52,250 --> 01:04:52,875
Where are you taking us at this hour?

1333
01:04:53,375 --> 01:04:53,708
It's my son's wedding...

1334
01:04:54,208 --> 01:04:54,375
I'll give the orders around here.

1335
01:04:54,875 --> 01:04:55,250
Not you guys, you bloody...

1336
01:04:55,750 --> 01:04:59,250
What the...

1337
01:05:49,083 --> 01:05:52,125
Have you ever see a peacock dance
in the jungle? - No, I haven't.

1338
01:05:52,625 --> 01:05:56,125
Then see for yourself.

1339
01:06:08,125 --> 01:06:11,625
Uncle...

1340
01:06:42,208 --> 01:06:45,916
Father, brown cow.

1341
01:06:46,416 --> 01:06:48,291
That's a bull, not a cow.

1342
01:06:48,791 --> 01:06:50,916
He can't even tell the gender...

1343
01:06:51,416 --> 01:06:53,056
Who cares whether it's a cow or a bull...

1344
01:06:53,208 --> 01:06:54,125
why are we going in the first place?

1345
01:06:54,625 --> 01:06:56,333
I know the benefits of cow's urine.

1346
01:06:56,833 --> 01:06:57,833
But I won't drink it now.

1347
01:06:58,291 --> 01:07:01,166
You can get it packed, I'll
drink it after the wedding.

1348
01:07:01,666 --> 01:07:04,958
Okay, father. - Stop calling me father.

1349
01:07:05,458 --> 01:07:06,708
You two aren't married yet.

1350
01:07:07,208 --> 01:07:11,041
Father... Father... he is so annoying.

1351
01:07:11,541 --> 01:07:14,291
This doctor is of brother's acquaintance.
- You're embarrassing me.

1352
01:07:14,791 --> 01:07:15,041
Be quiet.

1353
01:07:15,541 --> 01:07:16,666
Eyebrow... did I tell you
to give her a makeup?

1354
01:07:17,166 --> 01:07:17,458
I said eye-drops.

1355
01:07:17,958 --> 01:07:21,125
Hello.

1356
01:07:21,625 --> 01:07:24,166
Mr. Joshi. - Yes... yes... that's me.

1357
01:07:24,666 --> 01:07:25,875
Come in. - Yes...

1358
01:07:26,375 --> 01:07:27,375
Come on.

1359
01:07:27,708 --> 01:07:28,750
But he's a Vet. - Quiet.

1360
01:07:29,250 --> 01:07:30,290
Just do as I say. Come on.

1361
01:07:30,541 --> 01:07:31,041
What happened? - Nothing.

1362
01:07:31,541 --> 01:07:35,041
Come on.

1363
01:07:36,458 --> 01:07:40,666
Yes... so tell me.

1364
01:07:41,166 --> 01:07:46,625
Tell me... - Actually, he has a problem.

1365
01:07:47,125 --> 01:07:48,666
I see.

1366
01:07:49,166 --> 01:07:54,041
Actually, it's one of those problems.

1367
01:07:54,541 --> 01:07:59,458
Do you understand? - No... absolutely not.

1368
01:07:59,958 --> 01:08:03,416
You see, doctor, if we could
get a character certificate...

1369
01:08:03,916 --> 01:08:06,250
along with online proposals,
then we would've known.

1370
01:08:06,750 --> 01:08:07,250
But... - What do you mean?

1371
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:10,750
I was trying to say that...
- Can I... I tell him?

1372
01:08:11,250 --> 01:08:13,875
Yes, you... - I'll tell you
from the beginning, doctor.

1373
01:08:14,375 --> 01:08:15,375
Yeah...

1374
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:18,958
His daughter and I are
getting married in two days.

1375
01:08:19,458 --> 01:08:21,458
Love-arranged-love!

1376
01:08:21,958 --> 01:08:23,875
Understand? - No...

1377
01:08:24,375 --> 01:08:28,708
Actually, I belong from Delhi NCR...
- I see... now, I get it.

1378
01:08:29,208 --> 01:08:30,208
Arranged-Love-Arranged...

1379
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:31,500
I get it.

1380
01:08:31,541 --> 01:08:34,916
You see, mom and dad were
out of town one day.

1381
01:08:35,416 --> 01:08:37,166
So his daughter I got a little too close.

1382
01:08:37,666 --> 01:08:38,946
I mean physical... - Physical...

1383
01:08:38,958 --> 01:08:41,916
You should be ashamed! - I
swear I felt ashamed.

1384
01:08:42,416 --> 01:08:44,458
But how much shame can
you feel when you're 26?

1385
01:08:44,958 --> 01:08:47,291
Right. - I mean... why feel ashamed?

1386
01:08:47,791 --> 01:08:50,041
So that happened... I
mean, it didn't happen.

1387
01:08:50,541 --> 01:08:51,541
Nothing happened.

1388
01:08:51,750 --> 01:08:52,458
As soon as I touched her daughter...

1389
01:08:52,958 --> 01:08:54,638
How dare you touch her before the wedding?

1390
01:08:54,708 --> 01:08:55,708
She touched me too.

1391
01:08:55,833 --> 01:08:56,083
Look at the mark.

1392
01:08:56,583 --> 01:08:57,833
Our love isn't one-sided.

1393
01:08:58,333 --> 01:08:59,708
Mom gave her a fresh 500
rupees note at the engagement!

1394
01:09:00,208 --> 01:09:01,333
Not me, she gave it to Sugandha's mother.

1395
01:09:01,833 --> 01:09:04,458
So, you'll bring me to a vet? - Excuse me.

1396
01:09:04,958 --> 01:09:09,750
A man is also a social animal.

1397
01:09:10,250 --> 01:09:11,851
Please take him outside. - What is he...

1398
01:09:12,291 --> 01:09:14,041
Please go out, I'll talk to him.
- I'm as old as his father.

1399
01:09:14,541 --> 01:09:14,916
Look at the way he's talking.

1400
01:09:15,416 --> 01:09:15,791
I'll talk to him.

1401
01:09:16,291 --> 01:09:17,531
Please wait outside. - Hold on.

1402
01:09:17,791 --> 01:09:18,791
Talking won't help him.

1403
01:09:19,208 --> 01:09:21,458
Give him a pill or something. - Okay-okay.

1404
01:09:21,958 --> 01:09:23,398
You're my last hope. - Wait outside.

1405
01:09:23,541 --> 01:09:26,166
Come on... wait outside. - Doctor...
give him a really strong pill.

1406
01:09:26,666 --> 01:09:31,125
So... where were we? - So doctor, I...
I was saying that...

1407
01:09:31,625 --> 01:09:34,000
Don't lie to the doctor.

1408
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:39,291
How can I cure this, doctor? - No-no...

1409
01:09:39,791 --> 01:09:41,458
You are not sick.

1410
01:09:41,958 --> 01:09:44,958
This is due to stress.

1411
01:09:45,458 --> 01:09:47,458
Do you understand stress?

1412
01:09:47,958 --> 01:09:50,416
Performance Anxiety.

1413
01:09:50,916 --> 01:09:55,083
You see, a man's brain
is like a wedding-horse.

1414
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:56,041
Understand?

1415
01:09:56,541 --> 01:10:01,125
Until the wedding guests don't
dance, the horse won't move forward.

1416
01:10:01,625 --> 01:10:01,916
Huh?

1417
01:10:02,416 --> 01:10:05,416
You see when you fail to perform...

1418
01:10:05,916 --> 01:10:10,083
and you try to do it again, you
think about the same thing. - Yeah.

1419
01:10:10,583 --> 01:10:15,458
And, you don't take the test
again from the fear of failing.

1420
01:10:15,958 --> 01:10:19,083
What's happening is... the horse
is waiting for the procession...

1421
01:10:19,583 --> 01:10:21,463
and the procession is
waiting for the horse.

1422
01:10:21,833 --> 01:10:24,041
This movement is not happening...

1423
01:10:24,541 --> 01:10:28,041
You know..

1424
01:10:30,083 --> 01:10:35,708
So... what do I do? - You're Making
a big deal out of a small issue.

1425
01:10:36,208 --> 01:10:38,958
That's exactly what I can't do, doctor.

1426
01:10:39,458 --> 01:10:40,750
Relax...

1427
01:10:41,250 --> 01:10:42,750
Forget everything, and relax.

1428
01:10:43,250 --> 01:10:45,650
I am getting married in three
days, and you're saying relax.

1429
01:10:46,125 --> 01:10:47,875
You're here with your family, aren't you?

1430
01:10:48,375 --> 01:10:49,416
Enjoy!

1431
01:10:49,916 --> 01:10:53,416
Go.

1432
01:10:57,708 --> 01:10:58,708
But doctor... - Yeah...

1433
01:10:59,041 --> 01:11:01,875
How about a pill? - Why of course?

1434
01:11:02,375 --> 01:11:04,041
I do have pills.

1435
01:11:04,541 --> 01:11:07,916
You know what, keep these.

1436
01:11:08,416 --> 01:11:09,625
Here you go.

1437
01:11:10,125 --> 01:11:13,625
Orange toffee?

1438
01:11:20,458 --> 01:11:23,000
You have three days...

1439
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:25,208
Fix your problem.

1440
01:11:25,708 --> 01:11:27,208
If you can't fix it...

1441
01:11:27,708 --> 01:11:31,208
then, I won't hesitate
to call off the wedding.

1442
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:41,916
You can go ahead and try, father-in-law.

1443
01:11:42,416 --> 01:11:45,916
I'll elope with your daughter.

1444
01:11:50,041 --> 01:11:51,801
Sugu, take my advice...
you still have time.

1445
01:11:52,041 --> 01:11:53,708
Run away, dear.

1446
01:11:54,208 --> 01:11:54,666
Where's the bride?

1447
01:11:55,166 --> 01:11:56,375
Let us meet her too. - I
am your father after all.

1448
01:11:56,875 --> 01:11:58,541
And Vimla, you're a drama-queen.

1449
01:11:59,041 --> 01:12:00,250
Yell out loud saying "My
daughter ran away"!

1450
01:12:00,750 --> 01:12:02,875
Run away... - Have you lost your mind?

1451
01:12:03,375 --> 01:12:04,875
Aunt, this is nothing new.

1452
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:08,335
Anupam Kher said the same thing to Pooja
Bhatt in 'Dil Hai Ki Manta Nahi'.

1453
01:12:08,375 --> 01:12:09,583
See... - See what?

1454
01:12:10,083 --> 01:12:11,083
See what, papa?

1455
01:12:11,458 --> 01:12:12,833
Doesn't my choice matter at all?

1456
01:12:13,333 --> 01:12:15,333
Papa, I want you to be like
Amrish Puri in DDLJ...

1457
01:12:15,791 --> 01:12:17,592
and you're going on
your own trip instead.

1458
01:12:17,791 --> 01:12:19,666
People are doubting your manhood.

1459
01:12:20,166 --> 01:12:21,791
And, I find out about this now.

1460
01:12:22,291 --> 01:12:26,708
You could've told me before
telling your father-in-law.

1461
01:12:27,208 --> 01:12:28,583
You never have time for me.

1462
01:12:29,083 --> 01:12:30,204
All day you're at your shop.

1463
01:12:30,375 --> 01:12:32,616
And in the evening, you need
your drink and Sunny Leone.

1464
01:12:32,625 --> 01:12:34,375
Deol... Sunny Deol.

1465
01:12:34,875 --> 01:12:37,291
I watch Sunny Deol films, not Sunny Leone.

1466
01:12:37,791 --> 01:12:38,791
Stop yelling at him.

1467
01:12:39,250 --> 01:12:40,250
Try to understand, Sugu.

1468
01:12:40,583 --> 01:12:42,416
Will you be able to endure your
father and mother-in-law's taunts?

1469
01:12:42,916 --> 01:12:43,375
I will...

1470
01:12:43,875 --> 01:12:45,208
It's my life, I'll do
whatever has to be done.

1471
01:12:45,708 --> 01:12:47,069
But I will only marry Mudit, okay.

1472
01:12:47,291 --> 01:12:49,875
My dear, joint families are a class apart.

1473
01:12:50,375 --> 01:12:50,875
Take me for instance.

1474
01:12:51,375 --> 01:12:53,015
I've been enduring since I left Haridwar.

1475
01:12:53,333 --> 01:12:54,733
But you're still alive, aren't you?

1476
01:12:55,041 --> 01:12:59,708
You're happy. - And what
about your happiness?

1477
01:13:00,208 --> 01:13:02,489
You see, dear, the society has
already set all the rules.

1478
01:13:02,916 --> 01:13:04,083
He's a man, she's a woman...

1479
01:13:04,583 --> 01:13:05,944
If anything goes wrong tomorrow...

1480
01:13:06,250 --> 01:13:06,833
they are not going to spare you.

1481
01:13:07,333 --> 01:13:09,134
And, what if the guy
loses his mind tomorrow.

1482
01:13:09,583 --> 01:13:11,666
Then your world will come
crashing down, dear.

1483
01:13:12,166 --> 01:13:13,646
Don't say anything about Mudit, papa.

1484
01:13:13,833 --> 01:13:15,666
I told him a dozen times, but no...

1485
01:13:16,166 --> 01:13:18,000
My own son turned out to be impotent.

1486
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:19,861
There's nothing wrong with my son.

1487
01:13:20,083 --> 01:13:21,250
I am sure something's wrong
with their daughter.

1488
01:13:21,750 --> 01:13:21,958
I see...

1489
01:13:22,458 --> 01:13:23,875
How can you be so sure?

1490
01:13:24,375 --> 01:13:24,875
I am his mother.

1491
01:13:25,375 --> 01:13:25,875
I know everything.

1492
01:13:26,375 --> 01:13:29,166
Only I know how hard I had
to scrub his underwear.

1493
01:13:29,666 --> 01:13:30,666
So that's that then.

1494
01:13:31,083 --> 01:13:32,083
Your mother has spoken.

1495
01:13:32,541 --> 01:13:34,291
Now I'll turn you into a man.

1496
01:13:34,791 --> 01:13:38,291
If anyone points fingers at you,
I will yank his tongue out.

1497
01:13:38,791 --> 01:13:40,791
Even if it's your father-in-law.

1498
01:13:41,291 --> 01:13:42,583
This is my wedding...

1499
01:13:43,083 --> 01:13:47,958
I'll deal with it, you're
not going to interfere.

1500
01:13:48,458 --> 01:13:50,833
Why did you have to talk to him like that?

1501
01:13:51,333 --> 01:13:52,373
He's pointing finger at me

1502
01:13:52,708 --> 01:13:53,708
Again...

1503
01:13:54,166 --> 01:13:55,416
What's going on here?

1504
01:13:55,916 --> 01:13:58,396
There are dozens of people who
haven't eaten, the food's over.

1505
01:13:58,500 --> 01:13:58,833
Is this a joke?

1506
01:13:59,333 --> 01:13:59,958
And where are the kidney beans?

1507
01:14:00,458 --> 01:14:01,125
You were making kidney beans, weren't you?

1508
01:14:01,625 --> 01:14:01,958
Where are the kidney beans?

1509
01:14:02,458 --> 01:14:04,938
Can't you tell the difference
between lentil and kidney beans?

1510
01:14:05,291 --> 01:14:07,000
Are you blind? - What's wrong, uncle?

1511
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:08,833
There are at least two dozen
people who haven't eaten...

1512
01:14:09,333 --> 01:14:10,000
and the food's already over.

1513
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:12,101
What happened? - What's he going to say?

1514
01:14:12,208 --> 01:14:14,916
Let him speak. - Even you
are yelling at me, Mudit.

1515
01:14:15,416 --> 01:14:16,416
Can't you see that there's
no more food left, and...

1516
01:14:16,916 --> 01:14:17,916
So creating a scene.

1517
01:14:18,375 --> 01:14:20,415
The food's over and these
people haven't eaten yet.

1518
01:14:20,416 --> 01:14:21,616
Where's your cook? - The cook.

1519
01:14:21,750 --> 01:14:23,666
Where's the cook? - This is the limit.

1520
01:14:24,166 --> 01:14:24,583
Sugandha.

1521
01:14:25,083 --> 01:14:26,375
Sugu... - You've really embarrassed us...
and we can't face anyone now.

1522
01:14:26,875 --> 01:14:30,375
He's going to kill the cook.

1523
01:14:41,875 --> 01:14:43,666
What's he doing?

1524
01:14:44,166 --> 01:14:46,291
Golu, get the jar of cauliflower pickles.

1525
01:14:46,791 --> 01:14:48,541
Is he our son or a cook?

1526
01:14:49,041 --> 01:14:51,875
Where is she going now?

1527
01:14:52,375 --> 01:14:56,083
Uncle was making a scene
because there was no food.

1528
01:14:56,583 --> 01:14:59,750
It's alright.

1529
01:15:00,250 --> 01:15:02,958
This is not done. - See,
her mother's smiling.

1530
01:15:03,458 --> 01:15:05,208
Then you smile back. - I won't...

1531
01:15:05,708 --> 01:15:10,875
Are you learning to cook?
- Learning to love you.

1532
01:15:11,375 --> 01:15:14,541
Will you forget after the wedding...

1533
01:15:15,041 --> 01:15:16,208
I mean loving me?

1534
01:15:16,708 --> 01:15:20,125
I'll learn how to cook.

1535
01:15:20,625 --> 01:15:23,791
Brother...

1536
01:15:24,291 --> 01:15:24,791
Brother...

1537
01:15:25,291 --> 01:15:27,291
The potatoes have turned into French fries.

1538
01:15:27,791 --> 01:15:29,666
Oh, sorry.

1539
01:15:30,166 --> 01:15:31,406
Where are the onions? - Onions?

1540
01:15:31,458 --> 01:15:32,458
Mudit!

1541
01:15:32,833 --> 01:15:34,375
We don't eat onions and garlic.

1542
01:15:34,875 --> 01:15:37,166
But we cook onions also with onions.

1543
01:15:37,666 --> 01:15:38,666
So, what now?

1544
01:15:38,708 --> 01:15:40,069
What will we do after the wedding?

1545
01:15:40,541 --> 01:15:43,000
We don't even touch.

1546
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:47,541
Even we don't touch the
girl before the wedding.

1547
01:15:48,041 --> 01:15:51,541
But we did.

1548
01:15:55,333 --> 01:15:56,333
Brother...

1549
01:15:56,375 --> 01:15:57,416
Brother...

1550
01:15:57,916 --> 01:15:59,791
Brother... - What?

1551
01:16:00,291 --> 01:16:01,291
The lentil's ready.

1552
01:16:01,708 --> 01:16:04,250
We need to serve everyone.

1553
01:16:04,750 --> 01:16:06,833
She turned my son into a cook.

1554
01:16:07,333 --> 01:16:09,541
Son, you're the groom. - Please stay quiet.

1555
01:16:10,041 --> 01:16:11,083
I am not talking to you.

1556
01:16:11,583 --> 01:16:12,583
I am talking to my son.

1557
01:16:13,083 --> 01:16:14,416
Do you really think we
don't understand anything?

1558
01:16:14,916 --> 01:16:16,477
Even the son-in-law has certain duties.

1559
01:16:16,833 --> 01:16:19,083
Hold on... wait a minute.

1560
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:22,375
The pre-wedding photo and video session...

1561
01:16:22,875 --> 01:16:25,875
will begin tomorrow morning at 9.

1562
01:16:26,375 --> 01:16:29,250
So, I would request the
bride and groom's family...

1563
01:16:29,750 --> 01:16:30,990
to take part in this event.

1564
01:16:31,375 --> 01:16:34,875
Thank you.

1565
01:16:40,291 --> 01:16:41,625
45, 50...

1566
01:16:42,125 --> 01:16:43,125
Back again.

1567
01:16:43,333 --> 01:16:46,000
Once more.

1568
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:48,125
Yes...

1569
01:16:48,625 --> 01:16:52,333
"Even if the world threatens me to death"

1570
01:16:52,833 --> 01:16:56,208
"I'll still win."

1571
01:16:56,708 --> 01:17:00,750
"Not a pebble can ever come"

1572
01:17:01,250 --> 01:17:04,833
"between you and me."

1573
01:17:05,333 --> 01:17:07,291
"If you're there"

1574
01:17:07,791 --> 01:17:09,041
"holding my hands"

1575
01:17:09,541 --> 01:17:11,166
"I'll take care of society"

1576
01:17:11,666 --> 01:17:13,166
"I'll take care of necessities."

1577
01:17:13,666 --> 01:17:16,958
"Although my dreams are small-budget"

1578
01:17:17,458 --> 01:17:19,458
"My love for you is priceless."

1579
01:17:19,958 --> 01:17:21,458
One two three start.

1580
01:17:21,958 --> 01:17:25,750
"Not a pebble can ever come"

1581
01:17:26,250 --> 01:17:29,750
"Between you and me."

1582
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:53,083
"I don't expect you to be"

1583
01:17:53,583 --> 01:17:55,333
"great as Lord Rama or crazy as Ranjha."

1584
01:17:55,833 --> 01:17:57,375
"That much is enough for me"

1585
01:17:57,875 --> 01:17:59,250
"As much we share between us."

1586
01:17:59,750 --> 01:18:03,375
"Small all big all your
dreams are mine now."

1587
01:18:03,875 --> 01:18:07,500
"For the dreams that I had
are already accomplished."

1588
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,791
"If you'll be there"

1589
01:18:10,291 --> 01:18:11,875
"holding my hands"

1590
01:18:12,375 --> 01:18:14,055
"what will be left for me to ask from god"

1591
01:18:14,458 --> 01:18:16,019
"everything I wished for will be mine."

1592
01:18:16,458 --> 01:18:20,125
"But if my heart ever falters"

1593
01:18:20,625 --> 01:18:24,208
"please be there to break its fall."

1594
01:18:24,708 --> 01:18:28,375
"Not a pebble can ever come"

1595
01:18:28,875 --> 01:18:32,416
"Between you and me."

1596
01:18:32,916 --> 01:18:35,833
"Our bride is too fancy"
- Listen Sugu, the wedding is tomorrow.

1597
01:18:36,333 --> 01:18:39,833
Mudit, I have an idea. - What?

1598
01:18:48,208 --> 01:18:51,708
Where are they going?

1599
01:18:58,750 --> 01:19:01,291
They just went inside and locked the doors.

1600
01:19:01,791 --> 01:19:03,592
Well, they couldn't have
done it in the open?

1601
01:19:03,750 --> 01:19:03,916
But...

1602
01:19:04,416 --> 01:19:05,416
Brother. - Yes, brother.

1603
01:19:05,458 --> 01:19:09,125
What is all this?

1604
01:19:09,625 --> 01:19:10,825
There's a limit to everything.

1605
01:19:11,125 --> 01:19:12,565
Why are you guys getting so furious?

1606
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:13,375
The wedding is tomorrow.

1607
01:19:13,875 --> 01:19:14,375
One day doesn't make a difference.

1608
01:19:14,875 --> 01:19:15,458
Whether they do it today or tomorrow?

1609
01:19:15,958 --> 01:19:18,375
Does this look nice before the wedding?

1610
01:19:18,875 --> 01:19:20,155
I am sure it does, I don't know.

1611
01:19:20,583 --> 01:19:22,333
Right, sister-in-law?

1612
01:19:22,833 --> 01:19:23,916
Don't look at me.

1613
01:19:24,416 --> 01:19:24,791
What do I know?

1614
01:19:25,291 --> 01:19:25,666
Look there.

1615
01:19:26,166 --> 01:19:27,166
Wait, brother.

1616
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:29,541
What if they still don't find a solution?

1617
01:19:30,041 --> 01:19:30,291
Oh, God!

1618
01:19:30,791 --> 01:19:31,791
I'll go ask the priest.

1619
01:19:31,833 --> 01:19:35,333
Why do you always involve
the priest in everything?

1620
01:19:38,291 --> 01:19:41,291
Keep pouring it. - He'll do it.
He'll do it.

1621
01:19:41,791 --> 01:19:43,041
Even his father will do it.

1622
01:19:43,541 --> 01:19:44,541
I mean...

1623
01:19:44,666 --> 01:19:48,291
He still does it... sometimes.

1624
01:19:48,791 --> 01:19:50,352
What about you? - How much did you bet?

1625
01:19:50,500 --> 01:19:51,500
200...

1626
01:19:51,541 --> 01:19:52,541
He's going to do it.

1627
01:19:52,916 --> 01:19:53,916
Uncle bets 500...

1628
01:19:54,041 --> 01:19:54,708
Says, it's not his cup of tea.

1629
01:19:55,208 --> 01:19:56,583
Uncle. - I said the same thing.

1630
01:19:57,083 --> 01:19:57,416
I bet 600...

1631
01:19:57,916 --> 01:20:01,250
The priest was saying we must pour
the ghee when we say 'swaha'.

1632
01:20:01,750 --> 01:20:02,871
And we must do it 100 times.

1633
01:20:03,250 --> 01:20:04,571
It doesn't take that long, aunty.

1634
01:20:04,666 --> 01:20:06,708
It's quicker nowadays. - Be quiet.

1635
01:20:07,208 --> 01:20:08,750
Go on...

1636
01:20:09,250 --> 01:20:10,458
Brother. - Yes.

1637
01:20:10,958 --> 01:20:12,791
I've made two menu options.

1638
01:20:13,291 --> 01:20:15,750
If he does it, we'll serve Dal Makhni.

1639
01:20:16,250 --> 01:20:16,583
Ohhh man...

1640
01:20:17,083 --> 01:20:20,750
If he doesn't, we'll serve normal lentils.

1641
01:20:21,250 --> 01:20:23,850
Whether this wedding takes place
or not, people are going to eat.

1642
01:20:24,333 --> 01:20:28,291
Can you please wait, brother?
- You do understand, don't you?

1643
01:20:28,791 --> 01:20:29,791
Why are you crying?

1644
01:20:30,083 --> 01:20:31,166
Everyone's watching you.

1645
01:20:31,666 --> 01:20:32,125
Why are you crying?

1646
01:20:32,625 --> 01:20:33,083
Be quiet.

1647
01:20:33,583 --> 01:20:35,375
Can't help it if I feel like crying.

1648
01:20:35,875 --> 01:20:39,208
A father can be ruthless,
but not the mother.

1649
01:20:39,708 --> 01:20:43,875
Where... what...

1650
01:20:44,375 --> 01:20:47,333
He was only this big... when
the doctors handed him to me.

1651
01:20:47,833 --> 01:20:53,166
Sister, even Sugandha was the same size.

1652
01:20:53,666 --> 01:20:57,166
Tell me... will they do it?

1653
01:21:00,541 --> 01:21:04,416
Sister... I tried to keep the
blouse as low as I could.

1654
01:21:04,916 --> 01:21:06,708
But, the rest is up to them.

1655
01:21:07,208 --> 01:21:09,041
They will do it.

1656
01:21:09,541 --> 01:21:11,958
My little boy. - He's my son!

1657
01:21:12,458 --> 01:21:13,708
Nothing about him is 'little'.

1658
01:21:14,208 --> 01:21:14,458
Nothing!

1659
01:21:14,958 --> 01:21:16,208
What?

1660
01:21:16,708 --> 01:21:18,541
What are you giggling about?

1661
01:21:19,041 --> 01:21:20,916
You think it's funny? - Hold on.

1662
01:21:21,416 --> 01:21:22,791
You're being funny, aren't you?

1663
01:21:23,291 --> 01:21:25,166
Had you imbibed some values in him,

1664
01:21:25,666 --> 01:21:26,958
he wouldn't have publicly
held my daughter's hand...

1665
01:21:27,458 --> 01:21:28,250
and taken her inside the room. - Oh...

1666
01:21:28,750 --> 01:21:30,000
It wasn't my son.

1667
01:21:30,500 --> 01:21:31,791
It was your daughter. - No...

1668
01:21:32,291 --> 01:21:33,291
Don't you dare...

1669
01:21:33,500 --> 01:21:34,500
Listen...

1670
01:21:34,625 --> 01:21:38,125
She dragged my son inside...

1671
01:21:46,892 --> 01:21:47,892
What happened?

1672
01:21:47,916 --> 01:21:48,916
Did you do it?

1673
01:21:49,291 --> 01:21:50,791
Save that for later...

1674
01:21:51,291 --> 01:21:51,708
Tell me.

1675
01:21:52,208 --> 01:21:53,208
Huh!

1676
01:21:53,541 --> 01:21:57,041
Play...

1677
01:21:59,500 --> 01:22:00,500
Come on, pay up.

1678
01:22:00,541 --> 01:22:05,041
Brother, pardon me for my mistakes.

1679
01:22:05,541 --> 01:22:08,166
How was it?

1680
01:22:08,666 --> 01:22:12,166
It didn't happen.

1681
01:22:16,625 --> 01:22:20,125
Sugu...

1682
01:22:21,333 --> 01:22:23,708
It didn't happen.

1683
01:22:24,208 --> 01:22:25,208
Aunty... - Huh?

1684
01:22:25,666 --> 01:22:26,875
It didn't happen. - Huh!

1685
01:22:27,375 --> 01:22:30,875
Didn't happen.

1686
01:22:32,333 --> 01:22:33,333
Listen...

1687
01:22:33,583 --> 01:22:35,208
Didn't happen. - Stop the music!

1688
01:22:35,708 --> 01:22:36,708
Stop it...

1689
01:22:36,750 --> 01:22:38,541
But we did it. - No, we didn't Mudit.

1690
01:22:39,041 --> 01:22:40,916
We did it so well. - No, we didn't.

1691
01:22:41,416 --> 01:22:44,000
But we did it. - Wouldn't I know?

1692
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:44,791
Fine, how can you say we didn't do it?

1693
01:22:45,291 --> 01:22:48,750
We did it so well. - Come here.

1694
01:22:49,250 --> 01:22:51,666
Is anyone going to say something?

1695
01:22:52,166 --> 01:22:53,166
Did they do it or not?

1696
01:22:53,333 --> 01:22:58,000
Did I win or lose?

1697
01:22:58,500 --> 01:22:58,958
Oh!

1698
01:22:59,458 --> 01:23:02,041
I told you, this man is good for nothing.

1699
01:23:02,541 --> 01:23:03,875
This man... I am telling you,
his son isn't the right guy.

1700
01:23:04,375 --> 01:23:05,750
Try to understand.

1701
01:23:06,250 --> 01:23:09,750
Why shouldn't I? she's my daughter.

1702
01:23:19,666 --> 01:23:23,166
Mudit's problem has no solution.

1703
01:23:23,666 --> 01:23:26,375
There is one way. - What?

1704
01:23:26,875 --> 01:23:28,500
The only way.

1705
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,791
Bless you, son.

1706
01:23:32,291 --> 01:23:32,791
Sugu...

1707
01:23:33,291 --> 01:23:35,000
She's asleep again.

1708
01:23:35,500 --> 01:23:37,541
My child, wake up.

1709
01:23:38,041 --> 01:23:40,416
See... you'll be marrying the banana tree.

1710
01:23:40,916 --> 01:23:42,041
Mudit's parents are here.

1711
01:23:42,541 --> 01:23:43,000
The priest is here.

1712
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:43,875
Everyone's waiting.

1713
01:23:44,375 --> 01:23:45,791
Come, dear. - Be quiet.

1714
01:23:46,291 --> 01:23:46,916
Didn't I warn you about this?

1715
01:23:47,416 --> 01:23:49,291
These guys will never admit
something's wrong with their son.

1716
01:23:49,791 --> 01:23:51,916
Look at this, they threw
your birth chart on my face.

1717
01:23:52,416 --> 01:23:54,625
They were saying there's
a flaw in her planets.

1718
01:23:55,125 --> 01:23:57,445
There's a hurdle in having kids
after the marriage. see...

1719
01:23:57,625 --> 01:23:59,065
So why are you creating hurdles now?

1720
01:23:59,541 --> 01:24:00,166
They even told us about the solution.

1721
01:24:00,666 --> 01:24:01,875
Get her married to a banana tree,
and everything will be fine.

1722
01:24:02,375 --> 01:24:03,375
What? - Sugu...

1723
01:24:03,458 --> 01:24:05,208
Sugu... there's still time.

1724
01:24:05,708 --> 01:24:06,083
Here you go.

1725
01:24:06,583 --> 01:24:06,916
Here you go, son.

1726
01:24:07,416 --> 01:24:08,583
Take this... and run.

1727
01:24:09,083 --> 01:24:11,166
Run away. - Stop telling her to run away.

1728
01:24:11,666 --> 01:24:13,586
What's the problem if she
marries a banana tree?

1729
01:24:13,750 --> 01:24:14,250
She's not marrying a cactus.

1730
01:24:14,750 --> 01:24:14,958
Come, dear. - No!

1731
01:24:15,458 --> 01:24:17,208
Sugu... these people can
stoop to any level.

1732
01:24:17,708 --> 01:24:18,208
They can do anything, Sugu.

1733
01:24:18,708 --> 01:24:19,708
Run away, dear. Come on.

1734
01:24:20,125 --> 01:24:21,885
Take this. Take it...
- Where are you going?

1735
01:24:22,291 --> 01:24:23,833
I don't care what the rest think.

1736
01:24:24,333 --> 01:24:25,875
I just care about what Mudit thinks!

1737
01:24:26,375 --> 01:24:27,375
Sugu... - Sugu.

1738
01:24:27,708 --> 01:24:27,916
Wait...

1739
01:24:28,416 --> 01:24:30,083
Come here.

1740
01:24:30,583 --> 01:24:32,263
You're going to see your would-be husband.

1741
01:24:32,291 --> 01:24:32,541
You shouldn't go empty-handed.

1742
01:24:33,041 --> 01:24:33,333
Take this cup of tea.

1743
01:24:33,833 --> 01:24:35,416
Are you all mad?

1744
01:24:35,916 --> 01:24:39,416
She forgot her stole. - Sugu,
take this too. - Sugu...

1745
01:24:49,708 --> 01:24:51,750
Sugu...

1746
01:24:52,250 --> 01:24:56,291
I thought I was so positive.

1747
01:24:56,791 --> 01:24:58,541
Shall we try again?

1748
01:24:59,041 --> 01:25:01,166
Neha, what are you doing here?

1749
01:25:01,666 --> 01:25:03,750
Same thing... you couldn't
do with Sugandha.

1750
01:25:04,250 --> 01:25:06,166
What couldn't I do with her?

1751
01:25:06,666 --> 01:25:08,958
It's time for us to be one, Mudu...
- Stop this nonsense.

1752
01:25:09,458 --> 01:25:10,898
Tyagi and Duggal told me everything.

1753
01:25:11,083 --> 01:25:11,625
If I find them, I'll turn them into a pulp.

1754
01:25:12,125 --> 01:25:13,125
Go back to sleep, Montu.

1755
01:25:13,458 --> 01:25:16,258
I knew it from the other day when I
met you at the engagement. - What?

1756
01:25:16,333 --> 01:25:18,413
There's definitely some
problem between you and her.

1757
01:25:18,500 --> 01:25:21,208
You two don't look like a couple at all.
- What are you saying?

1758
01:25:21,708 --> 01:25:24,791
You know... after you left,
I had two breakups myself.

1759
01:25:25,291 --> 01:25:26,791
So, what should I do? - Do
you know what that means?

1760
01:25:27,291 --> 01:25:28,500
What? - It's a sign.

1761
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:30,500
We're made for each other.

1762
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,500
I know what your problem is...

1763
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:35,000
and so do you. - What?

1764
01:25:35,333 --> 01:25:37,791
Did you have a problem when
you were with me? - No.

1765
01:25:38,291 --> 01:25:40,291
We spent so much time together. - Yes.

1766
01:25:40,791 --> 01:25:41,791
Did we ever go out? - No.

1767
01:25:42,125 --> 01:25:43,333
Did you ever take me to Buddha Garden?
- No.

1768
01:25:43,833 --> 01:25:46,125
We used to stay inside the room all day.
- Yeah...

1769
01:25:46,625 --> 01:25:47,625
Remember?

1770
01:25:48,125 --> 01:25:49,500
Did we have a problem?

1771
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:51,000
No, right?

1772
01:25:51,041 --> 01:25:52,875
Isn't it?

1773
01:25:53,375 --> 01:25:54,496
My life's already in a mess.

1774
01:25:54,666 --> 01:25:55,875
Let me go.

1775
01:25:56,375 --> 01:26:01,000
I really love Sugu.

1776
01:26:01,500 --> 01:26:02,500
Just look at that!

1777
01:26:02,750 --> 01:26:04,833
His father's waiting
with the banana tree...

1778
01:26:05,333 --> 01:26:07,134
while he's trying out
different positions.

1779
01:26:07,541 --> 01:26:10,500
See, dear... see...

1780
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:11,500
Sugu.

1781
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:12,291
Hey sugu.

1782
01:26:12,791 --> 01:26:13,125
Get up.

1783
01:26:13,625 --> 01:26:15,250
How can anyone be such a lowlife, Vimla?

1784
01:26:15,750 --> 01:26:18,083
Where are you going?

1785
01:26:18,583 --> 01:26:20,703
Who is the girl? - We should
clobber him with a shoe.

1786
01:26:21,125 --> 01:26:22,125
Sugu...

1787
01:26:22,541 --> 01:26:23,541
You're mistaken.

1788
01:26:23,875 --> 01:26:24,250
No, we're not...

1789
01:26:24,750 --> 01:26:26,270
You just messed with the wrong family.

1790
01:26:26,666 --> 01:26:27,875
These online types are
just like that, aunty.

1791
01:26:28,375 --> 01:26:30,176
I thought you are Alibaba
but you're a thief.

1792
01:26:30,583 --> 01:26:32,791
Let me go. Sugandha. - You
won't go after her.

1793
01:26:33,291 --> 01:26:35,583
She's dead for you.
- Sugu will tell me that.

1794
01:26:36,083 --> 01:26:38,250
Someone stop that pervert.

1795
01:26:38,750 --> 01:26:40,351
Take some really nice pictures. - Yes...

1796
01:26:40,625 --> 01:26:41,625
Come, daughter-in-law...

1797
01:26:41,750 --> 01:26:43,500
See... we even found a banana tree.

1798
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:45,000
Daughter-in-law...

1799
01:26:45,125 --> 01:26:46,885
How can you leave without
covering yourself?

1800
01:26:47,250 --> 01:26:48,333
Where are you going?

1801
01:26:48,833 --> 01:26:50,250
Move. - Curse you.

1802
01:26:50,750 --> 01:26:52,500
Sugu...

1803
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,916
Sugu... - Someone catch him.

1804
01:26:55,416 --> 01:26:57,096
Your idea didn't work. - It was your idea.

1805
01:26:57,458 --> 01:26:57,958
Get lost.

1806
01:26:58,458 --> 01:26:59,416
She should've at least covered herself.

1807
01:26:59,916 --> 01:27:01,458
She's gone. - Wait.

1808
01:27:01,958 --> 01:27:02,291
Sugandha. Sugandha.

1809
01:27:02,791 --> 01:27:05,250
We'll get daughter-in-law
married to the banana tree...

1810
01:27:05,750 --> 01:27:07,390
so solve the flaws in her birth-chart.

1811
01:27:07,458 --> 01:27:09,583
See... here's the tree.
- Stop this nonsense, papa.

1812
01:27:10,083 --> 01:27:10,500
She's gone.

1813
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:12,121
She didn't go anywhere, son.

1814
01:27:12,333 --> 01:27:13,375
She just went out for a
stroll, she will be back.

1815
01:27:13,875 --> 01:27:15,208
She didn't go anywhere, son.

1816
01:27:15,708 --> 01:27:17,869
If we don't complete this
ritual, you won't have kids.

1817
01:27:18,291 --> 01:27:20,411
She didn't go out for a
stroll, she left me for good.

1818
01:27:20,541 --> 01:27:20,791
Don't you get it?

1819
01:27:21,291 --> 01:27:22,750
She will come back. - The ritual is
still incomplete, how can she leave.

1820
01:27:23,250 --> 01:27:24,250
With your rituals.

1821
01:27:24,333 --> 01:27:26,174
Tell me something, are
you on my side or hers?

1822
01:27:26,541 --> 01:27:27,250
I am on Sugandha's side. - Wait...

1823
01:27:27,750 --> 01:27:27,833
I am on Sugandha's side.

1824
01:27:28,333 --> 01:27:29,291
I am on Sugandha's side.
- Then listen carefully.

1825
01:27:29,791 --> 01:27:31,592
Sugandha will have to
marry this banana tree.

1826
01:27:31,750 --> 01:27:32,250
Move aside, let me go.

1827
01:27:32,750 --> 01:27:34,951
Forget the banana tree, Sugu
won't even marry your son.

1828
01:27:35,416 --> 01:27:36,416
Why not? - No, she won't.

1829
01:27:36,833 --> 01:27:37,916
What are you saying?

1830
01:27:38,416 --> 01:27:41,250
We traveled so far... spent all that money.

1831
01:27:41,750 --> 01:27:42,958
What about that? - Let's
not talk about expenses.

1832
01:27:43,458 --> 01:27:44,819
I have an account for every penny.

1833
01:27:45,291 --> 01:27:46,458
Get my glasses.

1834
01:27:46,958 --> 01:27:50,791
If we go back empty-handed,
it will be an insult to us.

1835
01:27:51,291 --> 01:27:52,416
Fine,

1836
01:27:52,916 --> 01:27:53,916
He's insulted us!

1837
01:27:54,333 --> 01:27:55,333
He's insulted us!

1838
01:27:55,458 --> 01:27:56,500
Get that out of my way.

1839
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:57,375
Listen...

1840
01:27:57,875 --> 01:27:59,075
We won't go back empty-handed.

1841
01:27:59,375 --> 01:28:00,333
We'll take Sugandha back
as our daughter-in-law.

1842
01:28:00,833 --> 01:28:01,083
Bring Sugandha here.

1843
01:28:01,583 --> 01:28:02,916
Sugu won't marry him! - She will.

1844
01:28:03,416 --> 01:28:03,958
No, she won't. - Yes, she will.

1845
01:28:04,458 --> 01:28:06,375
No, she won't. - Yes, she will.

1846
01:28:06,875 --> 01:28:08,375
You and your banana tree!

1847
01:28:08,875 --> 01:28:10,716
I've been trying to tell
you Sugandha is gone.

1848
01:28:10,750 --> 01:28:12,625
But who listens to me...

1849
01:28:13,125 --> 01:28:14,565
Listen, fathers... what do you want?

1850
01:28:14,583 --> 01:28:15,583
Marry this banana tree...

1851
01:28:15,625 --> 01:28:15,791
Here you go...

1852
01:28:16,291 --> 01:28:18,500
What kind of a son is he?

1853
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:20,000
Who performs the rituals?

1854
01:28:20,416 --> 01:28:22,166
Who performs the rituals? - The girl...

1855
01:28:22,666 --> 01:28:25,291
Who performs the rituals?
- The boy can too.

1856
01:28:25,791 --> 01:28:27,250
Then do it...

1857
01:28:27,750 --> 01:28:31,625
What's he doing?

1858
01:28:32,125 --> 01:28:34,250
Chant the mantras.

1859
01:28:34,750 --> 01:28:38,791
(priest chanting)

1860
01:28:39,291 --> 01:28:41,625
Offer this flower.

1861
01:28:42,125 --> 01:28:44,000
The problem is with me, your son.

1862
01:28:44,500 --> 01:28:46,833
Why will she marry a banana tree?

1863
01:28:47,333 --> 01:28:47,750
I will...

1864
01:28:48,250 --> 01:28:50,330
I am sitting right here,
let's see who can budge me.

1865
01:28:50,375 --> 01:28:52,750
Take the nuptial rounds.

1866
01:28:53,250 --> 01:28:54,250
And you...

1867
01:28:54,583 --> 01:28:55,791
I thought I'll talk to you.

1868
01:28:56,291 --> 01:28:57,731
I'll talk to you once you calm down.

1869
01:28:57,875 --> 01:28:58,996
But you're a big loud mouth.

1870
01:28:59,250 --> 01:29:01,625
Your volume doesn't seem to come down.

1871
01:29:02,125 --> 01:29:03,565
Where's the daughter-in-law's stole?

1872
01:29:03,750 --> 01:29:06,250
What do you care about her stole?

1873
01:29:06,750 --> 01:29:10,958
Irritating me with your
talks about manhood.

1874
01:29:11,458 --> 01:29:14,291
His daughter is turning me into a man.

1875
01:29:14,791 --> 01:29:15,833
She is trying.

1876
01:29:16,333 --> 01:29:19,041
Whatever confidence I've left,
is all because of his daughter.

1877
01:29:19,541 --> 01:29:20,750
Are the nuptial rounds complete?
- Yes, it is.

1878
01:29:21,250 --> 01:29:25,250
Who is going to tell me? - Me.

1879
01:29:25,750 --> 01:29:27,041
Join your hands?

1880
01:29:27,541 --> 01:29:28,833
If you have some cash...

1881
01:29:29,333 --> 01:29:31,494
Doesn't matter if you don't.
- Someone give him a 100.

1882
01:29:31,625 --> 01:29:33,025
Where's my purse? - Do you have it?

1883
01:29:33,041 --> 01:29:36,541
Here you go, priest.

1884
01:29:37,625 --> 01:29:38,625
And you.

1885
01:29:38,791 --> 01:29:40,250
I am talking to you.

1886
01:29:40,750 --> 01:29:42,250
I've been trying to tackle this
problem for the last 6 months.

1887
01:29:42,750 --> 01:29:44,833
It'll come out somewhere.

1888
01:29:45,333 --> 01:29:47,293
And please don't give me
a character certificate.

1889
01:29:47,666 --> 01:29:51,166
Look at yourselves, people!

1890
01:29:53,208 --> 01:29:54,375
Take the blessings. - Whose?

1891
01:29:54,875 --> 01:29:55,958
Your parents.

1892
01:29:56,458 --> 01:29:57,618
Actually, it's not necessary.

1893
01:29:58,041 --> 01:30:00,458
They are not worthy of giving blessings.

1894
01:30:00,958 --> 01:30:04,458
If you bend before them, they kick you.

1895
01:30:12,375 --> 01:30:16,666
A real man is not someone
who doesn't feel pain.

1896
01:30:17,166 --> 01:30:19,125
A real man is someone who
doesn't hurt anyone...

1897
01:30:19,625 --> 01:30:21,958
and stops others from doing the same.

1898
01:30:22,458 --> 01:30:24,750
Are we done? Okay?

1899
01:30:25,250 --> 01:30:29,500
Or, would you like to drive
a truck over my head?

1900
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,500
I love her...

1901
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:36,291
Every time I see her name with
mine on the wedding card...

1902
01:30:36,791 --> 01:30:39,375
it makes me really happy.

1903
01:30:39,875 --> 01:30:43,375
She's sad and left me.

1904
01:30:43,875 --> 01:30:45,541
Can I go win back the one I love?

1905
01:30:46,041 --> 01:30:49,541
Or, do I need your permission?

1906
01:30:53,625 --> 01:30:54,791
Mudit.

1907
01:30:55,291 --> 01:30:59,541
If you go with that girl, then don't
come back home. - What the...

1908
01:31:00,041 --> 01:31:01,761
And, don't expect any money from me either.

1909
01:31:01,791 --> 01:31:02,958
I don't want your money.

1910
01:31:03,458 --> 01:31:04,666
Here's my purse.

1911
01:31:05,166 --> 01:31:06,166
Just return my license.

1912
01:31:06,583 --> 01:31:10,083
I got it made myself from the RTO.

1913
01:31:12,017 --> 01:31:13,017
You...

1914
01:31:13,041 --> 01:31:14,791
Why are you hitting me?

1915
01:31:15,291 --> 01:31:17,011
Every year we show you the arrangements...

1916
01:31:17,291 --> 01:31:19,916
of the 'ArdhKumbhMela' on
this holy land of Haridwar.

1917
01:31:20,416 --> 01:31:24,166
But this time, we suddenly
ran into a personality...

1918
01:31:24,666 --> 01:31:27,041
who will add to the
glory of this report.

1919
01:31:27,541 --> 01:31:29,333
And that's Bollywood star Jimmy Shergill.

1920
01:31:29,833 --> 01:31:30,291
Sir...

1921
01:31:30,791 --> 01:31:33,541
Hello... Hello...

1922
01:31:34,041 --> 01:31:35,208
Move... mister... move, please.

1923
01:31:35,708 --> 01:31:36,125
Madam... please...

1924
01:31:36,625 --> 01:31:36,750
Let me go.

1925
01:31:37,250 --> 01:31:37,541
Welcome sir.

1926
01:31:38,041 --> 01:31:38,041
Move.

1927
01:31:38,541 --> 01:31:39,541
So, what brings you here?

1928
01:31:39,875 --> 01:31:42,208
Well, out here we're shooting
an ad on family planning.

1929
01:31:42,708 --> 01:31:45,833
For a condom. - I see... so you're
here to shoot an ad for this 'condom'.

1930
01:31:46,333 --> 01:31:48,291
Condom. - 'Condom'.

1931
01:31:48,791 --> 01:31:50,071
Well, the name doesn't matter...

1932
01:31:50,375 --> 01:31:51,125
It is important that you use it.

1933
01:31:51,625 --> 01:31:54,208
Listen brother, Sister.

1934
01:31:54,708 --> 01:31:55,708
Let me go.

1935
01:31:56,041 --> 01:31:57,750
Where are you going?

1936
01:31:58,250 --> 01:32:02,083
Let him through. - He's calling.

1937
01:32:02,583 --> 01:32:03,833
Sir, my future wife is
in the temple up there.

1938
01:32:04,333 --> 01:32:05,500
I guess she took this path.
- What happened?

1939
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:07,416
Did she run away? - No, sir,
it's just a misunderstanding.

1940
01:32:07,916 --> 01:32:09,000
I just need to talk to her, and
I'll explain her everything.

1941
01:32:09,500 --> 01:32:12,333
Honestly... - I can understand your pain.

1942
01:32:12,833 --> 01:32:15,291
But, I hope it's not one of
those 'acid-attack' cases.

1943
01:32:15,791 --> 01:32:17,208
It's true love, sir.

1944
01:32:17,708 --> 01:32:18,708
That's good.

1945
01:32:19,208 --> 01:32:20,208
But, if she says no...

1946
01:32:20,500 --> 01:32:22,220
you must come back the way you're going.

1947
01:32:22,583 --> 01:32:24,041
And, if she loves you too...

1948
01:32:24,541 --> 01:32:26,221
then you must convince her at any cost.

1949
01:32:26,541 --> 01:32:27,583
Now go. - Thank you.

1950
01:32:28,083 --> 01:32:31,583
Let him through.

1951
01:32:38,500 --> 01:32:42,250
Aunty, please step aside.

1952
01:32:42,750 --> 01:32:46,250
Move-move...

1953
01:32:48,541 --> 01:32:52,041
Open it up.

1954
01:33:06,791 --> 01:33:09,791
Sugandha.

1955
01:33:10,291 --> 01:33:12,041
Sugu. - Mudit!

1956
01:33:12,541 --> 01:33:15,958
Sugu! - Mudit!

1957
01:33:16,458 --> 01:33:18,625
He jumped...

1958
01:33:19,125 --> 01:33:22,958
What are you doing?

1959
01:33:23,458 --> 01:33:25,166
Mudit. Mudit. Are you crazy? - Sugu.

1960
01:33:25,666 --> 01:33:26,666
What are you doing?

1961
01:33:26,833 --> 01:33:28,000
Stop this thing.

1962
01:33:28,500 --> 01:33:29,500
Hey there.

1963
01:33:29,750 --> 01:33:32,375
That's the image of
today's common Indian man

1964
01:33:32,875 --> 01:33:34,666
Educated... Decent guy...

1965
01:33:35,166 --> 01:33:37,166
Pull...

1966
01:33:37,666 --> 01:33:39,291
Lift me up. - No!

1967
01:33:39,791 --> 01:33:41,791
This is normally how we see this creature.

1968
01:33:42,291 --> 01:33:45,375
Dangling between two realities!

1969
01:33:45,875 --> 01:33:46,166
I will fall down.

1970
01:33:46,666 --> 01:33:47,833
You should fall down. You
should definitely fall down.

1971
01:33:48,333 --> 01:33:50,666
After this stupidity, you should fall down.

1972
01:33:51,166 --> 01:33:52,458
No gents, no gents problem.

1973
01:33:52,958 --> 01:33:53,208
Fall down I say.

1974
01:33:53,708 --> 01:33:58,958
Even this man is under the pressure of the
patriarchal society, like any other being.

1975
01:33:59,458 --> 01:34:00,458
Why did you jump?

1976
01:34:00,625 --> 01:34:03,166
I want to talk to you.
- So? I was coming down.

1977
01:34:03,666 --> 01:34:07,041
As a brother, husband, or just
another guy, he's lost in anonymity.

1978
01:34:07,541 --> 01:34:08,916
I am not wrong this time, Sugu.

1979
01:34:09,416 --> 01:34:11,833
If I was wrong, I wouldn't have jumped.

1980
01:34:12,333 --> 01:34:14,000
He needs a support, a strong arm...

1981
01:34:14,500 --> 01:34:15,666
which can pull him
in the right direction.

1982
01:34:16,166 --> 01:34:17,166
I just need two minutes.

1983
01:34:17,583 --> 01:34:17,833
Please.

1984
01:34:18,333 --> 01:34:19,654
Leaving him dangling like that...

1985
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,458
will be the biggest
tragedy of our society.

1986
01:34:22,958 --> 01:34:23,958
Lift me up.

1987
01:34:24,291 --> 01:34:27,958
The sweat's making my hands slippery...

1988
01:34:28,458 --> 01:34:29,458
I will fall down.

1989
01:34:29,666 --> 01:34:33,166
Sugu... - Give me your hands.

1990
01:34:36,500 --> 01:34:38,083
In this battle for better-half...

1991
01:34:38,583 --> 01:34:42,041
two halves will have
to make one complete.

1992
01:34:42,541 --> 01:34:43,041
He's saved.

1993
01:34:43,541 --> 01:34:47,041
He's saved.

1994
01:34:55,208 --> 01:34:58,708
Sugu... sorry...

1995
01:35:02,625 --> 01:35:03,916
Stay back.

1996
01:35:04,416 --> 01:35:07,916
I said stay back.

1997
01:35:41,791 --> 01:35:45,583
How many times will I have to plead?

1998
01:35:46,083 --> 01:35:52,041
I was going to die apologising.

1999
01:35:52,541 --> 01:35:56,041
Come on...

2000
01:36:16,875 --> 01:36:19,208
'We ran... fought with our family.'

2001
01:36:19,708 --> 01:36:22,000
'We didn't have a bike... or a bag.'

2002
01:36:22,500 --> 01:36:25,375
'But we did have that promise
of everlasting love.

2003
01:36:25,875 --> 01:36:28,458
'I am sure our fathers abused
and cussed us in their minds.'

2004
01:36:28,958 --> 01:36:31,119
'And, our mothers didn't slip
into depression either.'

2005
01:36:31,250 --> 01:36:34,750
'No one remembered how we got married?'

2006
01:36:39,125 --> 01:36:41,083
'Actually, if you have
the right partner...'

2007
01:36:41,583 --> 01:36:45,083
'...then, it doesn't matter if you
have a grand wedding or not.'

2008
01:37:04,666 --> 01:37:06,346
'Well, this story finally came to an end.'

2009
01:37:06,750 --> 01:37:10,250
'But, the climax you all
are waiting for...'

2010
01:37:13,500 --> 01:37:15,260
'That didn't happen on
our wedding night...'

2011
01:37:15,666 --> 01:37:16,987
'...nor on our honeymoon in Goa.'

2012
01:37:17,375 --> 01:37:19,083
'And nor after we came back.'

2013
01:37:19,583 --> 01:37:23,208
'Office, home, vegetables,
relatives... TV.'

2014
01:37:23,708 --> 01:37:25,875
'Wet underwear up... dry underwear down.'

2015
01:37:26,375 --> 01:37:27,615
'We even went to see a doctor.'

2016
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:29,791
It's not as hard as you think Mrs. Sharma.

2017
01:37:30,291 --> 01:37:31,612
You can ask anything if you want.

2018
01:37:31,625 --> 01:37:32,625
What was I saying to you?

2019
01:37:32,875 --> 01:37:34,333
And then, one day...

2020
01:37:34,833 --> 01:37:35,083
Glory to Lord...

2021
01:37:35,583 --> 01:37:35,666
Give it.

2022
01:37:36,166 --> 01:37:39,666
Pass it on to everyone, dear.

2023
01:37:42,625 --> 01:37:43,875
Me too, dear.

2024
01:37:44,375 --> 01:37:48,625
Give it to your father as well.

2025
01:37:49,125 --> 01:37:50,125
Here you go.

2026
01:37:50,166 --> 01:37:53,666
Sugu.

2027
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,791
Sugu. - What?

2028
01:37:58,291 --> 01:37:58,666
Come.

2029
01:37:59,166 --> 01:37:59,375
Go to the kitchen.

2030
01:37:59,875 --> 01:38:00,875
I'll be right back, mom.

2031
01:38:00,958 --> 01:38:03,500
Okay.

2032
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:07,500
Speak up.

2033
01:38:25,166 --> 01:38:26,916
You think it's funny...
