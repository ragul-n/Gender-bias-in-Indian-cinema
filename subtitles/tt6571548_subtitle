40
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,333
<i>Mr. Jiabao, Your Excellency,</i>

41
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:47,666
<i>when I heard you were coming
to meet some Indian entrepreneurs,</i>

42
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,833
<i>I just knew I had to email you.</i>

43
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:58,500

<i>sense of hygiene, discipline,

46
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:07,666
<i>does have entrepreneurs.</i>

47
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,666
<i>Prime Minister Jiabao
wants to learn</i>

48
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,166
<i>about India's
booming outsourcing economy…</i>

49
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:15,250
<i>I've been following the rise
of your country for some time, sir.</i>

50
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:20,125
<i>I know you Chinese are great lovers
of freedom and individual liberty.</i>

51
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:23,083
<i>The British tried
to make you their servants,</i>

52
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:24,833
<i>but you never let them.</i>

53
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:27,500
<i>I admire that, Mr. Premier.</i>

54
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:30,416
<i>You see, I was a servant once.</i>

55
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:38,083
<i>Today, I am a celebrated entrepreneur
in Bangalore,</i>

56
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:40,125
<i>the Silicon Valley of India.</i>

57
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:43,291
<i>They say it's named
after a Silicon Valley in America,</i>

58
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:46,625
<i>but I think we can agree
that America is so yesterday.</i>

59
00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:49,750
<i>India and China are so tomorrow.</i>

60
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:54,916
<i>In the belief that the future of the world</i>

61
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,625
<i>lies with the yellow man
and the brown man,</i>

62
00:03:57,708 --> 00:04:00,833
<i>now that our erstwhile master,
the white-skinned man,</i>

63
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:05,166
<i>has wasted himself through buggery,
cell phone usage, and drug abuse,</i>

64
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,875
<i>I offer to tell you, free of charge,</i>

65
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:12,166
<i>the truth about India
by telling you the story of my life.</i>

66
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:19,333
<i>These are the best-fed
and most important members of my family.</i>

67
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:22,166
<i>After them, my sly, old Granny, Kusum.</i>

68
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:27,000
<i>She had forced my brother,
Kishan, to work in the tea shop.</i>

69
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,833
<i>And she took every rupee
from my father, a rickshaw puller.</i>

70
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,833
<i>I come from the village of Laxmangarh,</i>

71
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,708
<i>which is in the darkness.</i>

72
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:39,375
<i>India is two countries in one,</i>

73
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:41,500
<i>an India of light</i>

74
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:45,375
<i>and an India of darkness.</i>

75
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:51,083
<i>I think a rich man like you
knows which one I come from.</i>

76
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:56,333
<i>To give you the basic facts about me,
there's no beating that poster,</i>

77
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:59,000
<i>the one the police made of me
some years ago</i>

78
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:01,458
<i>due to an act of entrepreneurship.</i>

79
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:07,125
<i>Yes, the police are looking for me. Why?</i>

80
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:09,250
<i>I'll get to that in time,</i>

81
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:14,541
<i>but only if you promise not to judge me
until I've told you my glorious tale.</i>

82
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:20,416
Read. You.

83
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:23,541
Can't you read it?

84
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:26,250
A, G, Z...

85
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:30,041
Have you taught them nothing,
you useless fuck?

86
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:31,684
- Sorry.
- What "sorry"?

87
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:33,388
"We live in a glorious land."

88
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:36,583
"The Lord Buddha
received enlightenment in this land."

89
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:41,208
"We are grateful to God
that we are born in this land."

90
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:43,125
Come here, boy.

91
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,541
Who is this woman?

92
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:51,208
The Great Socialist, sir.

93
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:53,958
What is the Great Socialist's message
for children?

94
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:57,333
Any poor boy in any forgotten village

95
00:05:57,875 --> 00:06:00,708
can grow up
to become prime minister of India.

96
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:03,791
In the jungle,
which is the rarest of animals

97
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:06,916
that comes along
only once in a generation?

98
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,625
The white tiger.

99
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:12,583
That is what you are. The white tiger.

100
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:18,458
I will ensure that you get a scholarship
to a school far away from here,

101
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:21,625
to our glorious capital, Delhi.

102
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:25,500
Papa, know what this is called?

103
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:26,875
What?

104
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,375
It's called "clavicle."

105
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:30,458
- Clavicle?
- Clavicle.

106
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:31,750
Clavicle?

107
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:34,250
And these
are called "shoulders."

108
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:36,750
And this is called "backbone."

109
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:40,875
- And what's this called?
- These are called "cheeks."

110
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:43,208
- And what's this called?
- This is called "nose."

111
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:44,691
What's this called?

112
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:48,625
<i>In the darkness, we all slept together…</i>

113
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:53,875
<i>with legs falling one over the other
like one creature, a millipede.</i>

114
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,916
LONG LIVE THE GREAT SOCIALIST

115
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:08,958
Hey, Balram!

116
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:18,791
<i>The Stork.
He was the landlord who ruled our village</i>

117
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:21,916
<i>and collected
a third of everything we earned.</i>

118
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,708
<i>He fed so much on the village
that there was nothing left to feed on.</i>

119
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:30,375
<i>We feared his elder son,
the Mongoose, even more.</i>

120
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:37,125
<i>And my father was
always in debt to them.</i>

121
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,333
Don't make me ask again!

122
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:49,833
Psst, psst! Munna!

123
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:53,500
Get your book and chalk, let's go.

124
00:07:57,583 --> 00:08:00,708
The tea shop? I'm supposed to go to Delhi.

125
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:03,041
Father didn't pay the master.

126
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:06,000
Granny said you have to work now.

127
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:07,083
Kishan!

128
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,000
What're you doing over there? Get to work!

129
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:16,166
Now break every last one.

130
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:21,041
You don't like it?

131
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,416
Imagine it's my skull you're breaking.

132
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,750
Hey, sweetie…

133
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:40,666
Eat your dinner.

134
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:44,441
<i>I never saw
the inside of a school again.</i>

135
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:46,750
Eat it.

136
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,970
<i>By the end of that year,</i>

137
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:52,958
<i>my father was sick with tuberculosis.</i>

138
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:57,583
<i>No politician
had built a hospital in Laxmangarh,</i>

139
00:08:57,666 --> 00:09:00,333
<i>so we had to travel
two days to another village.</i>

140
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:02,250
I'll find a doctor.

141
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:09,750
<i>No doctor ever came.</i>

142
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,850
<i>Election promises had taught me</i>

143
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:19,375
<i>how important it is
not to be a poor man in a free democracy.</i>

144
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:29,583
<i>♪ God's name is the truth… ♪</i>

145
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:22,333
<i>Even in death, he was resisting his fate.</i>

146
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:29,458
<i>Resisting to die, be reborn,
and die again, all for nothing.</i>

147
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:45,000
<i>I understood in this moment,</i>

148
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:48,291
<i>how hard it is for a man
to win his freedom in India.</i>

149
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,875
<i>Later, I came to realize why.</i>

150
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:57,708
<i>The greatest thing
to come out of this country</i>

151
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,291
<i>in its 10,000-year history…</i>

152
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:01,500
<i>the rooster coop.</i>

153
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,666
<i>They can see and smell the blood.</i>

154
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:15,083
<i>They know they are next,
yet they don't rebel.</i>

155
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:18,083
<i>They don't try and get out of the coop.</i>

156
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:26,166
<i>Servants here
have been raised to behave the same.</i>

157
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:30,958
<i>The furniture on his back
is worth at least two years his salary,</i>

158
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:34,500
<i>and yet he will faithfully pedal
the money back to his boss</i>

159
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:37,083
<i>without ever touching a single rupee.</i>

160
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:38,500
<i>No servant does.</i>

161
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:43,208
<i>Why? Because Indians are the world's
most honest and spiritual people?</i>

162
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:44,916
<i>No.</i>

163
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,208
<i>It's because 99.9% of us
are caught in the rooster coop.</i>

164
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:53,041
<i>The trustworthiness
of servants is so strong</i>

165
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:56,583
<i>that you can put
the key of emancipation in a man's hand</i>

166
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:59,416
<i>and he will throw it
back at you with a curse.</i>

167
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,375
<i>I had learned to use my time
to eavesdrop on customers,</i>

168
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:15,458
<i>waiting for an opportunity.</i>

169
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:18,791
Would you like some tea?
Put on some tea!

00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:21,250
<i>Something my brother
had given up on long ago.</i>

171
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:22,830
Make it quickly.

172
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:28,333
Are you deaf? Get to work.

173
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,125
THE GREAT SOCIALIST

174
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:49,916
<i>I know communists
like you don't believe in God, sir,</i>

175
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,166
<i>but do you believe in fate?</i>

176
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,833
<i>That was when I first saw him,
the Stork's youngest son, Mr. Ashok.</i>

177
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:01,833
<i>He had just moved from America
back to India, to Dhanbad,</i>

178
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:04,250
<i>where his family
had made a fortune in coal.</i>

179
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:08,000
<i>I knew then, this was the master for me.</i>

180
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:26,458
<i>I overheard them saying
they need a second driver for Mr. Ashok.</i>

181
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:28,041
He's just come back...

182
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:30,041
But you don't know how to drive!

183
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:36,125
I just need 300 rupees
for the driving lessons and...

184
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:40,541
No! You've always
been insolent like your father.

185
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:43,000
You'll stay right here with Kishan.

186
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,166
<i>Granny had married him off,</i>

187
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,708
<i>given him two weeks
to dip his beak into his wife,</i>

188
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:50,458
<i>and now he was stuck here.</i>

189
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:51,750
<i>I would be too.</i>

190
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,333
Okay, forget it.

191
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:59,750
I thought if I became their driver,
you'd buy a bunch of water buffaloes…

192
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:02,250
and be the envy of the village.

193
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:06,375
So you'll become
a driver for the landlords?

194
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:10,041
You could be
the richest woman in the village.

195
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:15,375
Swear on all the gods
you believe in

196
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:19,708
that you'll send every rupee,

197
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:21,791
every month, to your Granny.

198
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:23,833
- I swear.
- Stop smiling!

199
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:26,333
Pinch your hand and swear!

200
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:29,416
I'm pinching! Granny, just think…

201
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,875
You'll become
the richest woman in the village.

202
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:35,541
This cane will become gold,
and when you swing it like this,

203
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,666
the entire village
will line up to see you.

204
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:44,583
Wait! Granny made your favorite!

205
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:47,583
You eat your oily okra!
I'm gonna eat in Dhanbad!

206
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:22,666
<i>And now,
I just had to learn to drive.</i>

207
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,583
Right. Right. Right.

208
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:28,666
Watch out, sister-fucker!

209
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:31,125
You're from a caste of sweet makers.

210
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:34,791
Only a boy from a warrior class
can tame a wild stallion.

211
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:38,250
Muslims, Rajputs, Sikhs
have aggression in their blood.

212
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:43,291
Why don't you stick to making sweets?

213
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:51,083
It's not enough to drive.
You've got to become a driver.

214
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:54,625
Anyone tries to overtake you, do this…

215
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:56,541
Out of the way, sister-fucker!

216
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:00,708
Outta my way, fucker!

217
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:02,708
The road is a jungle.

218
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:07,041
A good driver
must roar to get ahead on it!

219
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:15,015
<i>It wasn't
so hard to find out where they lived.</i>

220
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:16,875
<i>I just had to get through the door.</i>

221
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,666
- Yeah?
<i>- Namaste, </i>sir.

222
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:27,916
What do you want?

223
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,708
Any need of a driver, sir?

224
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:32,809
I've got four years' experience.
My master recently died, so I...

225
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:34,750
Get lost. We have a driver already.

226
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:37,416
I see you have two cars, sir,
but do you have two drivers?

227
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,458
What's wrong with you?
Get lost, motherfucker.

228
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,458
Sir? This is your house?

229
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:45,375
<i>Namaste, </i>sir. I'm from
your village, sir! From Laxmangarh.

230
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:46,958
- Laxmangarh?
- Yes, sir!

231
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:49,791
The gods must be watching over us!

232
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:52,833
I used to work at
the tea stall, sir, at the main junction!

233
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:54,791
And I would bring tea
to your Ambassador car.

234
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:57,250
Let the boy in.

235
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:59,083
- But, sir...
- Let him in.

236
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:07,541
I can't believe it's you, sir.

237
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:10,333
How the crops died since you left.

238
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:11,791
And we prayed that…

239
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:14,755
…you should have more sons
to keep rule in the village, sir.

240
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:15,916
Get up.

241
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:19,750
Do people still remember me?

242
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:21,250
Of course, sir.

243
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,713
We all say
our father is gone, sir.

244
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:27,291
The best and the most holy
of the landlords, like Gandhi-<i>ji, </i>sir.

245
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:28,375
Like Gandhi?

246
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:30,500
<i>Ji, </i>sir. Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi-<i>ji.</i>

247
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:31,583
Okay. Okay.

248
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:33,541
What do you want?

249
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:35,250
Sir, with your permission, sir,

250
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:38,125
I want to be a driver for you…
or for your son.

251
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:40,458
- Are you Muslim?
- No, sir.

252
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:43,791
I bathe regularly,
keep myself clean, sir, and I'm not lazy.

253
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:45,875
- Hey, I'm Ashok.
- Hey, don't do that.

254
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:48,218
You need a driver,
let's take him for a spin.

255
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,970
- See how good he is.
- Yes, sir.

256
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:53,541
<i>Just my luck, the Mongoose.</i>

257
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:56,083
- He drives well.
- Yeah.

258
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:58,958
- What's your caste?
- Halwai, sir.

259
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:00,666
Is that a high caste or low?

260
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,190
<i>In the old days,</i>

261
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,250
<i>when India was
the richest nation on Earth,</i>

262
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,416
<i>there were 1,000 castes and destinies.</i>

263
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,625
<i>These days, there are just two castes.</i>

264
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:12,458
<i>Men with big bellies
and men with small bellies.</i>

265
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:15,958
<i>And there are only two destinies,
eat or get eaten up.</i>

266
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:17,875
- Low caste, sir.
- Ugh!

267
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:21,916
- All our servants are high caste.
- Why does his caste matter?

268
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,791
- You drink?
- No, sir.

269
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:26,500
- In my caste we never drink.
- So what do you do?

270
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:27,583
Steal?

271
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:30,125
Halwai?

272
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:31,791
- You're a sweet maker?
- Yes, sir.

273
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:33,916
That's why
you're so sweet to us?

274
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:37,500
- Do you cook?
- Certainly, sir. Very well.

275
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:40,000
- Like what?
- Sir, all kinds of sweets, sir.

276
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:43,833
Gulab jamun, rasgulla <i>ho gaya,</i>
ladoo, rasmalai, kaju barfi.

277
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:45,416
Whatever you like, sir.

278
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:49,541
The driver can cook too.
Only in India. Can you start tomorrow?

279
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:52,541
Not so fast, <i>bhai.</i>
We'll have to check on his family first.

280
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:55,458
- How much you want?
- I don't want any money, sir.

281
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:59,083
You are like parents to me.
How can I ask my parents for money?

282
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:00,416
Fifteen-hundred a month.

283
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,291
No, sir, that's too much.

284
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:04,458
Give me
half of that, sir. It's enough.

285
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:07,541
If we keep you
beyond two months, it will go to 2,000.

286
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:09,000
And you only drive me.

287
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:10,083
Yes, sir.

288
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:16,375
- Can you honk less?
- Bro, you wanna climb in here?

289
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:18,583
- Get moving!
- Watch how you drive!

290
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:22,791
- Why'd you do that? Don't.
- Get the rod? Get the rod.

291
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:27,166
I know you're play-acting.
You haven't been hired yet, hick!

292
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,340
<i>The Mongoose
must have called his man in Laxmangarh,</i>

293
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:37,041
<i>because two days later
when they did hire me,</i>

294
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:39,125
<i>they knew everything about my family.</i>

295
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:45,166
<i>The pride and glory
of our nation, the Indian family.</i>

296
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:52,041
<i>Every master has to know exactly where
their servant's family live at all times</i>

297
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:55,500
<i>just in case a servant decides
to steal from his employer and run.</i>

298
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:56,791
<i>If so…</i>

299
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,291
<i>Fair enough. I would do the same.</i>

300
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:11,726
<i>But it's what the masters do</i>

301
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,333
<i>to their servants' families.</i>

302
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:22,458
<i>This is how the rooster coop works.</i>

303
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:26,250
<i>This is how it traps so many millions
of men and women in India.</i>

304
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:30,750
<i>So rest assured, the Stork
and his sons could count on my loyalty.</i>

305
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:38,000
This is the room.

306
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:39,875
This is my room?

307
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:42,208
You'll share it with me.

308
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:44,666
I'll find a mattress
from the store for you.

309
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,291
No, there's no need for that.

310
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:49,458
I'll be quite comfortable on the floor.
Nothing to worry about.

311
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:51,708
There's even a first class roof!

312
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:55,250
Here. You're to wear this at all times.

313
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:56,996
- It's mine?
- Yes.

314
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:13,541
- Hey, hero!
- Yes, sir?

315
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:16,166
I hope you like carpets.

316
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:19,208
When you're done cleaning those,
wash all the windows.

317
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:20,500
Got it?

318
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:22,083
But I'm the driver, sir.

319
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:24,791
No. You're the "number two" driver.

320
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:45,125
<i>Is there any hatred on Earth</i>

321
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:48,416
<i>like the hatred of the number-two servant
for the number one?</i>

322
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:57,791
<i>While I cleaned,
he strolled about like a master.</i>

323
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:02,750
<i>He had every Hindu God lined up
and was always praying,</i>

324
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:07,000
<i>as if to accuse me of being a Naxal,
a communist, like you, sir.</i>

325
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:10,458
<i>I would not let him out pray me.</i>

326
00:22:23,666 --> 00:22:25,583
Sir,
why is Ram Persad not eating?

327
00:22:25,666 --> 00:22:28,875
- And his mouth stinks these days.
- You keep your mouth shut.

328
00:22:32,916 --> 00:22:34,916
<i>This man was hiding something,</i>

329
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,833
<i>and a successful entrepreneur
always finds his competition's secrets.</i>

330
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:48,666
Good job. Good. Did you hear that?
Yeah, that was good, right?

331
00:22:50,041 --> 00:22:54,125
Hey, driver!
Hey, driver. Can you come here, please?

332
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:57,875
All right,
I need you to lie down for this…

333
00:22:57,958 --> 00:22:59,166
Hey! Come in.

334
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:01,625
I wanted to ask you some questions.

335
00:23:01,708 --> 00:23:04,250
Hey, could you
turn around for me for a second?

336
00:23:04,333 --> 00:23:05,708
- Yes.
- No!

337
00:23:05,791 --> 00:23:08,958
That's not what I meant.
Just stand here.

338
00:23:09,041 --> 00:23:11,958
Um, I feel like your back's…

339
00:23:12,041 --> 00:23:13,708
<i>I'm ashamed to admit it now,</i>

340
00:23:13,791 --> 00:23:16,583
<i>but in that moment I thought
Mr. Ashok's wife, Pinky Madam,</i>

341
00:23:16,666 --> 00:23:18,208
<i>was one of "those women."</i>

342
00:23:18,291 --> 00:23:20,666
Oh, I'm so sorry,
I didn't even introduce myself.

343
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:23,250
Hi, I'm Pinky. Nice to meet you.

344
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:25,541
Honey, honey, all right.
I need to talk to him.

345
00:23:25,625 --> 00:23:27,375
- All right. Okay.
- I need to talk.

346
00:23:27,458 --> 00:23:31,541
So, uh, driver. We're both…
I'm sorry. What's your name?

347
00:23:31,625 --> 00:23:33,267
- Sir, Balram, sir.
- Yeah, Balram.

348
00:23:33,291 --> 00:23:36,500
So, Balram,
do you know what the Internet is?

349
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:40,291
No, sir, but I could drive
to the market right now, sir,

350
00:23:40,375 --> 00:23:41,500
and get as many as you want.

351
00:23:41,583 --> 00:23:43,708
No, it's okay. Thank you.

352
00:23:45,041 --> 00:23:46,291
Do you have Facebook?

353
00:23:47,083 --> 00:23:49,208
Yes, sir. Books.
I always loved books, sir.

354
00:23:49,291 --> 00:23:52,166
Yeah, I heard you can read.
Have you ever seen a computer?

355
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:56,375
Yes, sir. Actually, we had many of them
in the village, with the goats.

356
00:23:56,458 --> 00:23:57,500
- Goats?
<i>- Ji, </i>sir.

357
00:23:57,583 --> 00:24:00,000
The goats
are pretty advanced to use computers.

358
00:24:00,083 --> 00:24:02,541
<i>I could tell from their faces
I had made a mistake.</i>

359
00:24:02,625 --> 00:24:05,666
Pinky, you see. He's got two,
three years schooling in him.

360
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:08,500
He can read and write,
but he doesn't get what he's read.

361
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,125
He's half-baked.

362
00:24:10,208 --> 00:24:12,448
Okay, now you're being a jerk.
He's standing right there.

363
00:24:12,916 --> 00:24:14,836
- I'm not being a jerk.
- Come on, Ashok.

364
00:24:14,875 --> 00:24:16,166
You're missing the point, Pinky.

365
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:19,208
Our driver represents
the biggest untapped market in India,

366
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:23,166
waiting to surf the web, buy a cell phone,
rise up into middle class.

367
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:24,833
Something I can help him do.

368
00:24:27,625 --> 00:24:29,125
You're the new India, Balram.

369
00:24:29,208 --> 00:24:30,666
I am the new India, sir.

370
00:24:33,291 --> 00:24:34,291
You can go.

371
00:24:40,708 --> 00:24:43,000
<i>I didn't like the way
he had spoken about me.</i>

372
00:24:43,083 --> 00:24:46,166
<i>"Half-baked." But he was right.</i>

373
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:47,791
<i>When you come to India, sir,</i>

374
00:24:47,875 --> 00:24:50,333
<i>you'll meet hundreds
of millions of men like me.</i>

375
00:24:50,416 --> 00:24:54,250
<i>Open up our brown skulls
and look inside with a penlight.</i>

376
00:24:54,333 --> 00:24:58,166
<i>You'll find all these ideas,
half-formed, half-correct,</i>

377
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:02,458
<i>all buggering one another,
and that is what we live and act on.</i>

378
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:11,666
Ah!

379
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:13,916
Very good.
A little higher. Yeah, there.

380
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,875
Papa, India's future is in
outsourcing with American companies.

381
00:25:17,958 --> 00:25:21,250
Our future is China. They're building
superhighways, they need coal,

382
00:25:21,333 --> 00:25:22,458
and we sell coal.

383
00:25:22,541 --> 00:25:25,726
But I really think we should diversify.
The IT sector is booming, the Internet...

384
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:27,791
Internet? What is that?

385
00:25:28,833 --> 00:25:30,208
Coal is real. I can touch it.

386
00:25:30,291 --> 00:25:34,208
No, sir. I learned from Ashok Sir,
the Internet is as real as a spider's web,

387
00:25:34,291 --> 00:25:37,125
that it connects
all the human beings across...

388
00:25:37,208 --> 00:25:39,088
- Know what that was for?
- Yes, sir.

389
00:25:39,125 --> 00:25:40,125
What for?

390
00:25:40,666 --> 00:25:43,166
- For the Internet, sir.
- Hey!

391
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:46,125
You're pressing it too hard.
Papa is getting annoyed. Slow down.

392
00:25:46,208 --> 00:25:47,208
Hmm.

393
00:25:47,416 --> 00:25:48,726
Why do you hit the servants?

394
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:49,976
In America, they can sue you for that.

395
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,666
This is not America, son.

396
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:54,625
They respect us for that.
Remember that.

397
00:25:54,708 --> 00:25:57,083
Hey, a little higher.

398
00:26:36,291 --> 00:26:37,291
Hmm.

399
00:26:38,291 --> 00:26:39,291
Count it.

400
00:26:39,666 --> 00:26:41,333
I don't want to hear shit later.

401
00:26:42,791 --> 00:26:44,791
<i>I was only allowed to keep 200.</i>

402
00:26:44,833 --> 00:26:45,666
Good, sir.

403
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:49,083
<i>Granny sent Kishan
each month to take the rest back to her.</i>

404
00:26:49,166 --> 00:26:52,666
And they're not
from the same caste. She's a Christian.

405
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:55,041
- And he married her?
- Yeah.

406
00:26:55,125 --> 00:26:56,750
That's normal in America.

407
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:01,416
Her people were against it, too,
but he wouldn't listen.

408
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,000
- Is she American?
- No, no, she's Indian.

409
00:27:04,083 --> 00:27:07,250
She was born here.
She moved there when she was 12.

410
00:27:07,958 --> 00:27:09,750
She told me.

411
00:27:09,833 --> 00:27:11,291
She talks to you?

412
00:27:11,375 --> 00:27:12,625
Talks to me?

413
00:27:12,708 --> 00:27:15,125
She tells me everything.

414
00:27:15,208 --> 00:27:17,166
I'm their number one driver.

415
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:18,833
Are you serious?

416
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:22,416
Can I also come inside?

417
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,416
- It's not allowed.
- Why?

418
00:27:24,916 --> 00:27:27,666
What do you mean, "why"?
If Mukesh sees, he'll scold me.

419
00:27:30,416 --> 00:27:31,875
- Take care.
- Yes, you too.

420
00:28:27,416 --> 00:28:30,375
<i>What a fool
I had been. It was Ramadan.</i>

421
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:33,041
<i>Of course he couldn't eat
and drink during the day.</i>

422
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,750
<i>The number one driver was a Muslim,
and the Stork hated Muslims.</i>

423
00:28:46,333 --> 00:28:49,416
As long as there is a sun
and a moon, madam's name will remain!

424
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:53,166
Long live the madam!
Long live socialism!

425
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:54,809
<i>I almost fell down.</i>

426
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:58,208
<i>There was the woman I had seen
on a million election posters</i>

427
00:28:58,291 --> 00:28:59,416
<i>since I was a boy.</i>

428
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,291
<i>The Great Socialist.</i>

429
00:29:02,333 --> 00:29:05,625
<i>She was a low caste,
like me and everyone from the darkness.</i>

430
00:29:05,708 --> 00:29:07,208
<i>Like a good entrepreneur,</i>

431
00:29:07,291 --> 00:29:10,625
<i>she had pulled herself up
to become chief minister of our state.</i>

432
00:29:10,708 --> 00:29:14,666
<i>She knew how to stick it to the rich,
and we liked her for that.</i>

433
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:16,833
You take coal from the government mines

434
00:29:16,916 --> 00:29:20,750
without paying taxes
because I let it happen.

435
00:29:20,833 --> 00:29:23,313
And we have shown
our appreciation for that, madam.

436
00:29:23,375 --> 00:29:25,583
Two million rupees is a little too much.

437
00:29:25,666 --> 00:29:26,750
We'll be happy for some...

438
00:29:26,833 --> 00:29:29,041
Son! Come here.

439
00:29:29,125 --> 00:29:31,833
- Did you need something?
- I can get it.

440
00:29:31,916 --> 00:29:33,684
Come here, son.

441
00:29:33,708 --> 00:29:34,708
Come here, fucker!

442
00:29:39,458 --> 00:29:42,291
Your rich employers
are trying to bugger me.

443
00:29:42,958 --> 00:29:44,500
What do you say to that?

444
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:45,625
Driver, get lost.

445
00:29:45,708 --> 00:29:47,583
Shut up, mother-fucker!

446
00:29:48,166 --> 00:29:50,708
You don't want
to pay the government, pay me.

447
00:29:51,208 --> 00:29:52,208
2.5 million rupees.

448
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:53,958
And I mean it!

449
00:29:57,041 --> 00:30:00,916
Otherwise, back to Laxmangarh,
where I first found you hicks!

450
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:05,750
<i>Why pay this small-time sister-fucker?</i>

451
00:30:05,833 --> 00:30:09,833
Let's go straight to Delhi
and pay off the opposing party.

452
00:30:09,916 --> 00:30:12,125
She's going to lose the next election.

453
00:30:12,208 --> 00:30:16,000
I agree.
Papa, I want to go to Delhi.

454
00:30:16,083 --> 00:30:18,267
Stay here,
learn the family business.

455
00:30:18,291 --> 00:30:19,583
Let me and Mukesh handle this.

456
00:30:19,666 --> 00:30:21,626
- Come on...
- Papa, if I may. Sorry.

457
00:30:21,666 --> 00:30:24,458
You should not have been
disrespected the way you were today.

458
00:30:24,541 --> 00:30:26,500
That shouldn't have happened.
Shh! One second.

459
00:30:26,583 --> 00:30:28,708
Delhi is an international city
like New York.

460
00:30:28,791 --> 00:30:31,833
Hey, Ashok. Tell her
this is not a place for her to talk.

461
00:30:31,916 --> 00:30:33,083
Oh, my God! Excuse me.

462
00:30:33,166 --> 00:30:34,886
I'm sitting right here.
You can speak to me.

463
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:38,166
I am a doctor of chiropractic
with a DPT from NYU.

464
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:42,083
Pieces of paper are good for hanging
on the bedroom walls, where she belongs.

465
00:30:42,166 --> 00:30:44,500
Okay, you know what? No. You know what?

466
00:30:44,583 --> 00:30:45,983
Me and Ashok are gonna go to Delhi,

467
00:30:46,041 --> 00:30:49,791
we're gonna solve your tax fraud problem,
and send you a postcard. How about that?

468
00:30:50,583 --> 00:30:53,083
<i>Where did
Pinky Madam's aggression come from?</i>

469
00:30:53,166 --> 00:30:55,416
<i>- She didn't care about traditions.</i>
- I know my husband!

470
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,791
<i>And when the number one driver
got a bonus to drive my master to Delhi,</i>

471
00:31:02,041 --> 00:31:05,541
<i>I did something
I wish I did not have to tell you.</i>

472
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,309
- What are you doing?
- Oh, here you are!

473
00:31:13,333 --> 00:31:15,625
Actually, I gotta drive
Ashok Sir to Delhi.

474
00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:17,875
I gotta make the Pajero look perfect.

475
00:31:17,958 --> 00:31:20,333
You're mistaken. I'm taking them to Delhi.

476
00:31:20,416 --> 00:31:23,416
Really? To visit all the mosques there?

477
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:26,916
Get away from that.

478
00:31:33,416 --> 00:31:35,250
I don't think Mukesh Sir wants to give

479
00:31:35,333 --> 00:31:39,833
Mohammad Mohammad,
or whatever your name is…

480
00:31:39,916 --> 00:31:43,750
a raise of 3,000 rupees.

481
00:31:44,708 --> 00:31:45,750
Uh…

482
00:31:45,833 --> 00:31:48,375
I've been their driver for 20 years.

483
00:31:48,958 --> 00:31:51,000
Mr. Ashok is like my own son.

484
00:31:51,083 --> 00:31:53,875
I drove him to school when he was a boy.

485
00:31:55,041 --> 00:31:56,333
That's a good point.

486
00:31:57,625 --> 00:32:00,585
But only Allah knows what corrupt ideas
you put into my poor master's mind.

487
00:32:01,208 --> 00:32:03,458
Please, sir, I have a family.

488
00:32:05,458 --> 00:32:06,666
Don't we all.

489
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,500
<i>What a miserable life,</i>

490
00:32:10,583 --> 00:32:14,458
<i>having to hide his religion
and name just to get a job as a servant.</i>

491
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:17,583
<i>I wanted to run to him and apologize.</i>

492
00:32:17,666 --> 00:32:19,708
<i>"You go be their driver in Delhi."</i>

493
00:32:19,791 --> 00:32:21,166
<i>Forgive me, brother.</i>

494
00:32:30,708 --> 00:32:32,875
<i>You never know when they'll come in handy.</i>

495
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Hey!

496
00:32:56,083 --> 00:32:58,750

I gotta pee.

516
00:34:00,875 --> 00:34:02,875
Oh, no, poor baby!

517
00:34:05,583 --> 00:34:07,708
- Balram, you okay with the bags?
<i>- Ji, </i>madam.

518
00:34:07,791 --> 00:34:10,666
There's a concierge cart over there
which you should get.

519
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:14,458
Take all the luggage out,
and park the car properly.

520
00:34:14,541 --> 00:34:15,541
<i>Ji, </i>sir.

521
00:34:24,208 --> 00:34:26,125
That whole area is amazing.

522
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:30,125
There's a few things
that are too shiny, which I wanna change.

523
00:34:30,208 --> 00:34:33,250
- Put the bags down somewhere.
- Look at the balcony, baby!

524
00:34:33,333 --> 00:34:36,083
- The sky, sir!
- What? You want to see the shooting star?

525
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:41,416
Put the bags in the rooms
I tell you, and get this place cleaned up.

526
00:34:42,625 --> 00:34:44,791
<i>After making dinner for Mr. Ashok,</i>

527
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:46,708
<i>I took the car down to the garage.</i>

528
00:34:47,291 --> 00:34:50,708
<i>That's where all the servants lived,
including the drivers.</i>

529
00:34:54,916 --> 00:34:57,875
The thing to know
about Delhi is the roads are smooth,

530
00:34:57,958 --> 00:35:01,583
the people are bad,
and the police are rotten.

531
00:35:02,375 --> 00:35:05,375
The masters' clothes
get washed here and sent back up.

532
00:35:05,458 --> 00:35:06,333
Toilets are here.

533
00:35:06,416 --> 00:35:09,291
This phone rings when your boss wants you.

534
00:35:09,375 --> 00:35:11,958
There's even a temple if you wanna pray.

535
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:16,208
And here is our den of pleasures.

536
00:35:16,291 --> 00:35:19,625
When we have money, we play cards here.

537
00:35:19,708 --> 00:35:22,500
<i>This driver had
a skin disease called vitiligo</i>

538
00:35:22,583 --> 00:35:24,041
<i>that made him look like a clown.</i>

539
00:35:24,125 --> 00:35:25,958
<i>It made my stomach churn.</i>

540
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:29,000
All the crazy fun
happens here! Come!

541
00:35:33,083 --> 00:35:35,916
If you're not careful,
the mosquitos will eat you alive.

542
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,625
If they carry malaria,
you'll be sick as a dog for weeks.

543
00:35:39,708 --> 00:35:42,041
But if it's a dengue mosquito…

544
00:35:42,125 --> 00:35:44,791
I swear on my mother,
you'll shiver all over,

545
00:35:44,875 --> 00:35:46,500
and you'll die for sure.

546
00:35:46,583 --> 00:35:48,666
- Die from a mosquito?
- Definitely.

547
00:35:49,208 --> 00:35:50,541
This is your room.

548
00:35:52,833 --> 00:35:55,166
Nice. But who am I sharing it with?

549
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:57,041
- You plan on bringing your family?
- No.

550
00:35:57,125 --> 00:36:00,166
- You have plans to do some fucking?
- No.

551
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:03,208
- How's your little guy?
- Who's this homo pussy?

552
00:36:03,291 --> 00:36:04,291
Get going.

553
00:36:04,375 --> 00:36:05,916
- Check his bag.
- I'm looking.

554
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,250
- Come on, get!
- Bro, let us have a look.

555
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:09,976
This asshole's uniform's nicer than yours.

556
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
- Can tell by his bag he's useless.
- So, Country Mouse…

557
00:36:13,666 --> 00:36:15,416
how much they paying you?

558
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,708
Enough. I'm happy.

559
00:36:17,791 --> 00:36:21,125
Ah! You're a sweet, loyal dog, eh?

560
00:36:22,875 --> 00:36:25,958
<i>I tilted my body
as far as I could from his face.</i>

561
00:36:26,041 --> 00:36:27,791
If your boss wants anything…

562
00:36:27,875 --> 00:36:29,166
I have it all.

563
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:30,767
Foreign wines…

564
00:36:30,791 --> 00:36:32,291
Golf balls.

565
00:36:33,166 --> 00:36:34,406
Girls.

566
00:36:34,708 --> 00:36:37,916
My master does not
do these things. He's a good man.

567
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,333
A good man?

568
00:36:40,625 --> 00:36:41,791
He's a rich man!

569
00:36:45,958 --> 00:36:47,583
BALRAM

570
00:37:18,833 --> 00:37:21,750
- National Party Headquarters.
- Good morning, sir.

571
00:37:24,541 --> 00:37:26,625
- No worries.
- No, sir. Please, sir.

572
00:37:26,708 --> 00:37:28,666
Seriously, I got it. It's fine.

573
00:37:37,833 --> 00:37:39,166
<i>For the next few days,</i>

574
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:42,333
<i>I drove Mr. Ashok,
the Mongoose, and a red bag</i>

575
00:37:42,416 --> 00:37:44,666
<i>to see various government officials.</i>

576
00:37:46,125 --> 00:37:49,333
<i>Democracy, something
that you yellow-skinned men,</i>

577
00:37:49,416 --> 00:37:53,416
<i>despite your triumphs in sewage,
drinking water, and Olympic gold medals,</i>

578
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,875
<i>still don't have.</i>

579
00:37:55,916 --> 00:37:59,125
<i>If I were in charge of India,
I'd get the sewage pipes first,</i>

580
00:37:59,208 --> 00:38:00,708
<i>then the democracy.</i>

581
00:38:00,791 --> 00:38:03,083
To the President's House. Move it!

582
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,750
- Balram, I got it.
- Sir.

583
00:38:17,083 --> 00:38:18,559
Oy! That was our exit, idiot!

584
00:38:18,583 --> 00:38:20,125
Don't do that.

585
00:38:20,208 --> 00:38:23,041
We need to dump him
and get someone who knows Delhi.

586
00:38:23,125 --> 00:38:24,583
We just got here. Relax.

587
00:38:24,666 --> 00:38:28,000
Remember when you came to New York
and you couldn't even find 42nd Street?

588
00:38:28,083 --> 00:38:29,166
It happens.

589
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,208
You'll figure it out. Don't worry.

590
00:38:33,291 --> 00:38:35,541
<i>It was the first time
he touched me.</i>

591
00:38:35,625 --> 00:38:36,625
Sorry, sir.

592
00:38:47,708 --> 00:38:51,541
- Thank you so much. Yes.
- Yeah, take care. Bye-bye. Yes.

593
00:38:51,625 --> 00:38:53,541
<i>Why was Mr. Ashok upset?</i>

594
00:38:53,625 --> 00:38:57,333
<i>If I had gone into the President's house,
I would be shouting,</i>

595
00:38:57,416 --> 00:38:59,375
<i>"Balram was here! Balram was here!"</i>

596
00:39:00,583 --> 00:39:02,875
You'll keep
visiting them while I'm gone,

597
00:39:02,958 --> 00:39:05,125
and don't let them push you
for more money.

598
00:39:06,625 --> 00:39:09,625
Look.
We're driving past Mahatma Gandhi

599
00:39:09,708 --> 00:39:12,208
after just having given
a bribe to the minister.

600
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:16,041
The world's biggest democracy.
Fucking joke.

601
00:39:17,166 --> 00:39:20,416
- You sound like your wife.
- Don't talk about her.

602
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:23,125
I hope your madam knows
that you're staying on in India.

603
00:39:30,375 --> 00:39:31,666
Just a little bit.

604
00:39:32,541 --> 00:39:33,958
Mix it all up, please.

605
00:39:35,208 --> 00:39:38,791
<i>A good servant
must know his masters from end to end,</i>

606
00:39:38,875 --> 00:39:40,583
<i>from lips to anus.</i>

607
00:39:40,666 --> 00:39:41,666
Sir.

608
00:39:42,375 --> 00:39:44,833
Here you are, sir.
I removed all the potatoes.

609
00:39:44,916 --> 00:39:47,250
<i>And potatoes
made the Mongoose fart.</i>

610
00:39:47,333 --> 00:39:49,708
Good memory, boy!

611
00:39:49,791 --> 00:39:52,191
Give my brother
a reading of the meter each day.

612
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:53,250
Yes, sir.

613
00:39:53,291 --> 00:39:55,851
So we know that
you're not driving without permission

614
00:39:55,875 --> 00:39:57,958
and try to fuck the maid
in the car.

615
00:39:58,041 --> 00:40:00,750
What're you laughing at?

616
00:40:01,375 --> 00:40:05,291
Police put cameras in all
the statues in Delhi. They're watching.

617
00:40:05,375 --> 00:40:06,833
- Understand?
- Yes, sir.

618
00:40:06,916 --> 00:40:09,726
Air-conditioning and music
should be off when you're alone.

619
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:12,851
- Nobody cares about your air conditioner.
- If you keep the air-conditioning on…

620
00:40:12,875 --> 00:40:14,955
…he'll sit on your head
and fuck your ear.

621
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,440
You'll miss your train.

622
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:22,208
<i>Once the Mongoose left,
Mr. Ashok would be my only master.</i>

623
00:40:22,791 --> 00:40:25,500
<i>In Laxmangarh,
we would have called him the Lamb.</i>

624
00:40:25,583 --> 00:40:26,583
See ya.

625
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:33,958
Dude, I love this song.
Turn it up.

626
00:40:35,625 --> 00:40:37,916
Come on.
Mukesh <i>bhai </i>isn't here, turn it up.

627
00:40:38,458 --> 00:40:42,000
<i>My master's fruit-flavored
perfume rushed into my nostrils.</i>

628
00:40:42,083 --> 00:40:43,291
You like this?

629
00:40:44,791 --> 00:40:45,791
Yes, sir.

630
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:49,791
And don't tell anyone
about this, not even Pinky.

631
00:40:49,875 --> 00:40:50,750
No, no!

632
00:40:50,833 --> 00:40:53,583
- I promised her I would stop.
- No, sir.

633
00:40:53,666 --> 00:40:56,500
Everything between
servant and master is always secret.

634
00:40:56,583 --> 00:40:59,208
I'm not your master.
Don't say things like that.

635
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:02,166
And stop calling me "sir."

636
00:41:02,875 --> 00:41:05,500
- My name's Ashok. You can call me Ashok.
- Ashok.

637
00:41:05,583 --> 00:41:07,041
Yes, Ashok.

638
00:41:07,125 --> 00:41:09,625
I know it's not the best name,
but gotta live with it.

639
00:41:09,708 --> 00:41:12,500
- It is a really good name, sir.
- Really?

640
00:41:12,583 --> 00:41:14,958
- You like it? You keep it then.
<i>- Ji, </i>sir<i>.</i>

641
00:41:15,041 --> 00:41:18,125
<i>♪ Love forever, love has freely ♪</i>

642
00:41:18,208 --> 00:41:21,500
<i>♪ Turned forever, you and me… ♪</i>

643
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:25,625
Sir, you should represent
India in the Olympics.

644
00:41:25,708 --> 00:41:28,208
Sometimes I wish I had arms like you, sir.

645
00:41:28,291 --> 00:41:29,916
Would you be quiet, please?

646
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,375
Boom, boom, boom, boom!

647
00:41:31,458 --> 00:41:33,041
On your right!

648
00:41:35,541 --> 00:41:38,666
Balram, you're blocking my view.
Come here. Sit here.

649
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:41,791
<i>I had never seen a man
so happy in the darkness.</i>

650
00:41:54,625 --> 00:41:58,541
<i>The Lamb still had
the blood of a landlord in him, after all.</i>

651
00:42:08,291 --> 00:42:09,291
Bye, sir.

652
00:42:16,458 --> 00:42:19,375
This is great when
you're lonely or upset with your boss.

653
00:42:19,458 --> 00:42:24,625
This has revenge, rape, murder, sex.
It's got everything.

654
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:26,583
You can really enjoy yourself.

655
00:42:26,666 --> 00:42:28,000
You can even jerk off.

656
00:42:33,166 --> 00:42:35,458
Red bra, big boobs…

657
00:42:36,375 --> 00:42:38,625
Country Mouse, you like that?

658
00:42:38,708 --> 00:42:41,000
Big tits, huge asses!

659
00:42:41,083 --> 00:42:44,000
Hold them like mangoes
and nibble with your teeth.

660
00:42:44,083 --> 00:42:47,541
- And suck 'em right up!
- What's he talking about?

661
00:42:47,625 --> 00:42:51,250
But don't let your little mouse
get sucked up in their dark caves!

662
00:42:51,333 --> 00:42:52,791
Want me to put in a good word?

663
00:42:52,875 --> 00:42:58,125
I noticed how ladies in the city
don't have hair on their legs or armpits!

664
00:42:58,208 --> 00:42:59,041
What?

665
00:43:01,208 --> 00:43:05,000
Does your mom have hair here?
And here and here too?

666
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:07,708
Are all the women in your village hairy?

667
00:43:07,791 --> 00:43:10,208
The whole family hang like monkeys and...

668
00:43:10,291 --> 00:43:12,416
Why talk about mothers and sisters?

669
00:43:16,708 --> 00:43:18,000
Dude, we're just kidding.

670
00:43:18,083 --> 00:43:20,041
Do I talk about your mothers and sisters?

671
00:43:20,125 --> 00:43:21,434
- Come on!
- Hey! Come back.

672
00:43:21,458 --> 00:43:22,858
<i>There and then,</i>

673
00:43:22,916 --> 00:43:26,500
<i>I resolved never again to tell
anyone in Delhi anything I was thinking.</i>

674
00:43:27,708 --> 00:43:30,041
You fuckers
hide cards in your asses.

675
00:43:32,458 --> 00:43:33,458
Country Mouse!

676
00:43:33,875 --> 00:43:36,250
- Where are you going? Off to die?
- Hey!

677
00:43:36,333 --> 00:43:38,541
- Hey, fucker!
- You're a faggot.

678
00:43:42,291 --> 00:43:46,083
Uncle, is there a room
for someone to stay alone?

679
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:48,833
There's one there.

680
00:43:48,916 --> 00:43:50,458
But who wants to live alone?

681
00:44:34,666 --> 00:44:38,125
<i>Pinky Madam wanted to
visit Mr. Ashok's uncle near Laxmangarh,</i>

682
00:44:38,208 --> 00:44:41,666
<i>and so here I was,
driving home in the Stork's car.</i>

683
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:43,000
That's so pretty.

684
00:44:43,083 --> 00:44:44,875
<i>Ah, I hated her for this.</i>

685
00:44:44,958 --> 00:44:47,541
<i>If I crashed, it would be her fault.</i>

686
00:44:49,625 --> 00:44:51,500
Balram, are you happy
to go see your Granny?

687
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:53,823
- Yes, madam, very happy.
- Okay. Good.

688
00:44:58,875 --> 00:45:01,791
Balram, what did you just do?
You touched your finger to your eye?

689
00:45:02,333 --> 00:45:03,500
Did we pass something holy?

690
00:45:06,125 --> 00:45:07,125
Yes, sir.

691
00:45:07,583 --> 00:45:11,333
Actually, we just passed a sacred tree,
so I was offering my respects.

692
00:45:11,416 --> 00:45:12,666
Where? Which one?

693
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:15,083
- Over there, madam.
- Oh, that big one there.

694
00:45:15,166 --> 00:45:17,750
- This entire area is very holy.
- Wow.

695
00:45:17,833 --> 00:45:20,875
See how they worship nature?
Who'd do that in New York?

696
00:45:20,958 --> 00:45:23,791
- People with a backyard in Brooklyn.
- Yeah, right.

697
00:45:28,041 --> 00:45:30,375
You did that again.
Did we pass another one?

698
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,041
Yes, sir. You see that path over there?

699
00:45:33,125 --> 00:45:33,958
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

700
00:45:34,041 --> 00:45:36,333
Sir, they say
Lord Buddha walked on that path

701
00:45:36,416 --> 00:45:38,458
until he found the Tree of Enlightenment.

702
00:45:38,541 --> 00:45:39,708
- Really?
- Yes.

703
00:45:39,791 --> 00:45:40,791
Wow!

704
00:45:41,291 --> 00:45:44,250
Pardon me,
but I think you should do the same.

705
00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:48,500
- Otherwise, they say you become infertile.
- No.

706
00:45:48,583 --> 00:45:51,250
- Okay, we need to do this.
- No!

707
00:45:51,333 --> 00:45:54,583
What is it? Left, right,
and then your head. Just do it.

708
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:57,500
<i>I gave them reactions of piety</i>

709
00:45:57,583 --> 00:46:00,250
<i>for every tree, rock,
and temple we passed.</i>

710
00:46:00,333 --> 00:46:02,208
Do you see that hill over there, sir?

711
00:46:02,291 --> 00:46:03,625
<i>I was like a </i>sadhu <i>to them.</i>

712
00:46:03,708 --> 00:46:06,000
Left, right, head.

713
00:46:06,083 --> 00:46:08,750
- Left, right, head.
- Left, right, head.

714
00:46:19,958 --> 00:46:22,638
<i>I dropped them off
at Mr. Ashok's uncle's villa.</i>

715
00:46:23,333 --> 00:46:25,041
<i>We called him the Buffalo.</i>

716
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,500
<i>Then I knew I had to face my family.</i>

717
00:46:46,333 --> 00:46:48,333
Hi, uncle, how are you all doing?

718
00:46:52,125 --> 00:46:53,583
How's it going, brother?

719
00:46:54,333 --> 00:46:56,083
Now he remembers his family.

720
00:46:56,166 --> 00:46:58,625
You haven't sent money home
since you went to Delhi.

721
00:46:58,708 --> 00:47:02,250
Forgive me, brother. I'm here now.

722
00:47:06,625 --> 00:47:09,583
My grandson is a very big man!

723
00:47:10,208 --> 00:47:15,083
But he forces his Granny
to do all his work for him.

724
00:47:15,166 --> 00:47:19,541
This is the fate
of an old woman in this world.

725
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:28,333
<i>I wanted to bring him
to Delhi and save him from all this.</i>

726
00:47:29,125 --> 00:47:31,166
Eat the chicken.

727
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:33,791
I made it myself.

728
00:47:34,333 --> 00:47:37,000
You haven't had any like it in ages.

729
00:47:38,333 --> 00:47:39,875
Ashok Sir is a vegetarian.

730
00:47:41,166 --> 00:47:44,291
America made him completely lose his mind.

731
00:47:44,375 --> 00:47:46,625
I'm thinking of doing the same.

732
00:47:46,708 --> 00:47:48,083
What? Are you a Brahmin?

733
00:47:48,166 --> 00:47:50,416
Eat. You've gotten so thin.

734
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:53,833
A body should be filled out for marriage.

735
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:57,333
- Whose marriage?
- Yours!

736
00:47:57,416 --> 00:47:59,583
We found a girl for you.

737
00:47:59,666 --> 00:48:03,500
You'll be married by the end of the year.

738
00:48:08,208 --> 00:48:11,125
I need time. I'm not ready to get married.

739
00:48:11,208 --> 00:48:12,500
Not ready?

740
00:48:13,083 --> 00:48:14,625
Just eat the chicken.

741
00:48:14,708 --> 00:48:16,375
I don't want to get married.

742
00:48:16,458 --> 00:48:22,583
Stop thinking of yourself
and start thinking of the family.

743
00:48:24,541 --> 00:48:25,458
Eat.

744
00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:29,916
- You're not Ashok Sir.
- Did you not understand?

745
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,160
Are you going to force me?
I don't want to get married!

746
00:48:32,833 --> 00:48:34,166
You're driving me insane.

747
00:48:34,791 --> 00:48:35,791
Munna!

748
00:48:38,166 --> 00:48:40,416
Where are you going? Stop!

749
00:48:41,333 --> 00:48:42,333
What happened?

750
00:48:43,375 --> 00:48:45,583
- You must keep sending money.
- I won't send it.

751
00:48:45,666 --> 00:48:47,041
That's the family's money!

752
00:48:47,958 --> 00:48:51,541
She's sucked the blood
out of you and left you a shell.

753
00:48:51,625 --> 00:48:53,875
And she'll leave you to die, like Dad.

754
00:49:13,625 --> 00:49:16,375
Why don't I eat meat?
Why does Pinky wear pants?

755
00:49:16,458 --> 00:49:18,458
Why don't we have kids? They won't stop.

756
00:49:18,541 --> 00:49:20,625
I think
we should not go back there, sir.

757
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:21,958
Maybe.

758
00:49:24,166 --> 00:49:27,041
You know, one in every three buildings
in India is built in Bangalore.

759
00:49:27,583 --> 00:49:28,583
You know why?

760
00:49:28,958 --> 00:49:31,625
- Outsourcing with the US.
- Diversifying, sir?

761
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,625
Yeah, right. Not bad, Balram.

762
00:49:37,958 --> 00:49:39,916
I'm thinking to offer financial services.

763
00:49:40,833 --> 00:49:42,791
There's so many Wall Street firms I know.

764
00:49:44,291 --> 00:49:46,458
I can drive you
to Bangalore right now, sir.

765
00:49:47,333 --> 00:49:48,666
- Right now?
- Yes, sir.

766
00:49:49,583 --> 00:49:52,250
- It's on the opposite side of the country.
- It's okay, sir.

767
00:49:52,333 --> 00:49:54,416
I don't need sleep. I can drive all night.

768
00:49:55,166 --> 00:49:56,166
No, thank you.

769
00:49:56,833 --> 00:50:00,208
I got to make a business plan first.
Do it the right way.

770
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:02,208
You will, sir. You will.

771
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:04,250
Yes. I will.

772
00:50:05,125 --> 00:50:06,541
- Ashoky!
- Yeah?

773
00:50:07,833 --> 00:50:10,583
<i>If only Mr. Ashok
was a real entrepreneur,</i>

774
00:50:10,666 --> 00:50:13,333
<i>if only we had left for Bangalore
that very day,</i>

775
00:50:14,708 --> 00:50:16,708
<i>then things would've
turned out differently for us.</i>

776
00:50:20,416 --> 00:50:23,541
<i>Rich men are born
with opportunities they can waste.</i>

777
00:50:28,333 --> 00:50:29,333
<i>But a poor man?</i>

778
00:50:34,166 --> 00:50:37,416
Feels like, "Are we gonna go back home,
or does he want to stay here?"

779
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:39,291
You need to talk. Put your foot down.

780
00:50:39,375 --> 00:50:41,833
Yeah, but he's not had
that conversation with me.

781
00:50:41,916 --> 00:50:44,583
I think he's being vague
because he hasn't figured it out...

782
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:46,916
Balram! What are you doing?

783
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,291
- Your ginger teas, madam?
- With your hand.

784
00:50:49,875 --> 00:50:50,934
What's he doing?

785
00:50:50,958 --> 00:50:52,791
Pinky, this is disgusting.

786
00:50:52,875 --> 00:50:56,000
Your uniform is filthy and your mouth
smells of that <i>paan </i>all day. Just…

787
00:50:56,083 --> 00:50:58,625
Ugh! Just pick up this tea and leave.

788
00:50:59,291 --> 00:51:00,892
- Bring another cup.
- Yes, Madam.

789
00:51:00,916 --> 00:51:02,250
After you wash your hands.

790
00:51:02,333 --> 00:51:04,583
He's not usually like that. I'm sorry.

791
00:51:04,666 --> 00:51:07,125
These lower castes, <i>na,</i>
they're all the same.

792
00:51:07,625 --> 00:51:09,458
- See you soon.
- Keep visiting, okay?

793
00:51:09,541 --> 00:51:11,833
- Talk to Ashok, yeah?
- I will. Bye.

794
00:51:14,833 --> 00:51:16,958
- Balram?
<i>- Ji, </i>madam?

795
00:51:17,041 --> 00:51:18,125
Come here, please.

796
00:51:20,041 --> 00:51:23,083
- Come here.
- Madam, I'm really sorry. I will stop.

797
00:51:23,166 --> 00:51:26,416
- It's fine. Sit. Sit.
- I will stop eating <i>paan, </i>madam.

798
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:29,041
No. That's not what I'm… Just sit down.

799
00:51:29,833 --> 00:51:32,416
I think it's wrong
the way you work for us.

800
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:35,708
You should be finishing your education,
starting your own family.

801
00:51:35,791 --> 00:51:37,875
Ashok Sir and you are family to me, madam.

802
00:51:37,958 --> 00:51:41,333
- Don't say that. That's not true, Balram.
- Really, madam.

803
00:51:41,416 --> 00:51:43,833
No, you can't possibly believe that.

804
00:51:46,625 --> 00:51:48,750
Do you know what my parents do in America?

805
00:51:48,833 --> 00:51:51,541
They run this shitty little bodega
in Jackson Heights,

806
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,291
selling beer, <i>paan, </i>and porn.

807
00:51:54,375 --> 00:51:56,500
I used to do my homework in the basement.

808
00:51:56,583 --> 00:51:59,208
One night I saw my mom
being held at gunpoint,

809
00:51:59,291 --> 00:52:01,458
and she still finished
working the entire night.

810
00:52:02,166 --> 00:52:03,500
I got out, Balram.

811
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,625
What is it that you want to do?

812
00:52:07,041 --> 00:52:09,583
- I want to serve you and Ashok Sir.
- No.

813
00:52:09,666 --> 00:52:11,166
- Okay, stop. No.
- Really, madam.

814
00:52:11,250 --> 00:52:15,958
Stop saying that. That's why this
caste system thing is total bullshit.

815
00:52:16,041 --> 00:52:18,458
You know, Mukesh tried
to stop Ashok from marrying me

816
00:52:18,541 --> 00:52:20,291
because of this caste thing.

817
00:52:22,458 --> 00:52:23,458
Well, fuck him.

818
00:52:24,833 --> 00:52:26,166
And fuck that.

819
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:06,625
- Is this toothpaste?
- Yes, it's terrific, whiten your teeth.

820
00:53:06,708 --> 00:53:09,500
- Where can I find something for an itch?
- The medicine shop.

821
00:53:09,583 --> 00:53:10,583
Five hundred!

822
00:53:10,625 --> 00:53:13,375
- Are these for the office?
- Yep, take a look.

823
00:53:13,458 --> 00:53:17,083
Those are 200.
This is leather, better quality.

824
00:53:19,166 --> 00:53:21,583
Hundred-rupee sale!

825
00:53:21,666 --> 00:53:26,541
- How much?
- A hundred rupees sale!

826
00:53:26,625 --> 00:53:27,708
Pick any one.

827
00:53:27,791 --> 00:53:29,166
And 250 for the pant.

828
00:53:29,791 --> 00:53:32,000
It's a good designer pant.

829
00:53:41,625 --> 00:53:44,625
<i>Why had my father
never told me not to scratch my groin?</i>

830
00:53:46,750 --> 00:53:49,250
<i>Why had he never taught me
to brush my teeth?</i>

831
00:53:50,916 --> 00:53:54,083
<i>Why had he raised me
to live like such an animal?</i>

832
00:54:03,791 --> 00:54:07,541
<i>If only a man
could spit his past out so easily.</i>

833
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:16,833
<i>If you asked me to explain
how one event connects to another</i>

834
00:54:16,916 --> 00:54:20,041
<i>or how one motive
strengthens or weakens the next,</i>

835
00:54:20,916 --> 00:54:23,125
<i>I'll tell you
I don't understand these things.</i>

836
00:54:31,208 --> 00:54:34,916
<i>I should warn you
my story gets much darker from here.</i>

837
00:54:46,416 --> 00:54:48,500
Is something going
to jump out at me?

838
00:54:50,750 --> 00:54:52,208
Oh, my gosh!

839
00:54:52,291 --> 00:54:55,625
Happy birthday, madam.
Wish you many happy returns of the day.

840
00:54:55,708 --> 00:54:59,041
- Oh, <i>baboo. </i>That's great.
- How's he looking?

841
00:54:59,125 --> 00:55:00,601
- Please come in, Mr. Maharaja.
- Come in.

842
00:55:05,250 --> 00:55:06,791
Hey! Country Mouse!

843
00:55:08,458 --> 00:55:10,958
Don't stand there alone.
Come hang with us.

844
00:55:11,041 --> 00:55:13,291
Standing alone leads to bad thoughts.

845
00:55:13,375 --> 00:55:16,708
Look at him!
Dressed like the maharaja of England!

846
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:19,291
Hope you haven't
peed your pants.

847
00:55:19,375 --> 00:55:21,208
Someone get him a diaper.

848
00:55:23,125 --> 00:55:25,291
- Asshole!
- I'll lube you up…

849
00:55:26,458 --> 00:55:27,958
How's your room?

850
00:55:28,041 --> 00:55:31,000
Are there cockroaches in there?

851
00:55:35,333 --> 00:55:38,625
- It's fine…
- So great. Oh, my gosh, babe, he's asleep.

852
00:55:40,083 --> 00:55:42,791
- Balram!
- No! Don't wake him up! He's sleeping.

853
00:55:42,875 --> 00:55:45,583
How do we get home? Just wait...

854
00:55:45,666 --> 00:55:48,333
- Let me do it. I'll do it gently.
- Balram.

855
00:55:48,958 --> 00:55:50,666
Balram!

856
00:55:52,833 --> 00:55:55,583
Oh, my God.
I think he just shat his pants.

857
00:55:55,666 --> 00:55:56,791
I'm so sorry.

858
00:55:56,875 --> 00:55:59,583
- Oh, my God. I'm sorry. You okay?
- Oh, shit.

859
00:55:59,666 --> 00:56:02,416
- Are you okay?
- You okay? Huh?

860
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:05,666
- Oh, my God. I'm sorry.
- Come on, don't cry.

861
00:56:05,750 --> 00:56:07,833
- I dozed off.
- Sorry.

862
00:56:07,916 --> 00:56:08,750
No problem.

863
00:56:31,416 --> 00:56:34,583
Pinky, stop, stop.
Stop, Pinky. We're not alone.

864
00:56:35,458 --> 00:56:38,041
What? It's just Balram.

865
00:56:38,125 --> 00:56:39,458
Yeah, but…

866
00:56:40,625 --> 00:56:44,333
It doesn't matter, babe.
Come on. Come on, man.

867
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,333
You're so fucking drunk.

868
00:56:47,416 --> 00:56:50,458
I'm not drunk enough.
I want to go back to New York.

869
00:56:50,541 --> 00:56:52,583
- Not this again.
- "Again"?

870
00:56:52,666 --> 00:56:55,500
What do you mean, "Not this again"?
You never wanna talk about it.

871
00:56:55,583 --> 00:56:58,708
When we said we're coming to India,
it was supposed to be for six months.

872
00:56:58,791 --> 00:57:02,791
You don't talk to me about it because
you've decided that you want to stay here.

873
00:57:02,875 --> 00:57:05,208
I'm trying to help my family.
I owe it to them.

874
00:57:05,291 --> 00:57:06,833
Can we not talk about them?

875
00:57:06,916 --> 00:57:11,583
You know, you're like a non-entity
in front of them, you know that?

876
00:57:12,916 --> 00:57:14,000
It's like…

877
00:57:14,750 --> 00:57:16,250
It's like skim milk.

878
00:57:18,666 --> 00:57:20,041
Nobody likes skim milk.

879
00:57:27,666 --> 00:57:29,291
We can go to a bar…

880
00:57:29,375 --> 00:57:31,750
Oh, my God. Wait.

881
00:57:32,833 --> 00:57:33,833
Hi, precious!

882
00:57:33,916 --> 00:57:36,125
Take it, madam.
Only 100 rupees.

883
00:57:36,208 --> 00:57:37,666
I'm very hungry.

884
00:57:37,750 --> 00:57:38,875
Can I see?

885
00:57:38,958 --> 00:57:40,583
<i>Ji.</i>

886
00:57:40,666 --> 00:57:43,791
Please, madam. Take three for 200.

887
00:57:43,875 --> 00:57:46,541
- I'm hungry.
- Don't touch the car.

888
00:57:46,625 --> 00:57:48,541
Stop it. Don't be rude.

889
00:57:48,625 --> 00:57:49,750
- Sir?
- Balram!

890
00:57:51,208 --> 00:57:54,250
Good girl. Bye. <i>Rakhlo.</i>

891
00:57:54,916 --> 00:57:56,166
So sweet.

892
00:57:56,250 --> 00:57:58,541
- You know what? Balram?
<i>- Ji, </i>madam?

893
00:57:58,625 --> 00:58:02,000
- Get out. Can't speak to a kid like that.
- What are you doing?

894
00:58:02,083 --> 00:58:04,750
- Out.
- No, madam. I think I should drive.

895
00:58:04,833 --> 00:58:06,833
- Get out of the car.
- Sir?

896
00:58:06,916 --> 00:58:08,541
- She's the boss.
- Balram, hey.

897
00:58:08,625 --> 00:58:10,833
This is for you.

898
00:58:11,375 --> 00:58:14,083
I'll leave you here
with your Buddha for tonight.

899
00:58:14,166 --> 00:58:16,583
- It's green, hurry up.
- I don't need anyone.

900
00:58:16,666 --> 00:58:17,791
Ashok Sir!

901
00:58:17,875 --> 00:58:18,708
Bye!

902
00:58:54,333 --> 00:58:58,000
<i>What is a servant without a master?</i>

903
00:59:13,083 --> 00:59:17,666
- That was insane!
- That was fucking awesome! Fuck!

904
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:20,333
- Madam, let me...
- What are you doing? I'm driving.

905
00:59:20,416 --> 00:59:24,333
No, Balram. You're not driving.
Come here, come here, no, no, no.

906
00:59:24,416 --> 00:59:27,166
Did you think we'd leave you behind?
Are you angry with us?

907
00:59:27,250 --> 00:59:29,583
<i>Nahi, </i>madam.
You are like mother and father to me.

908
00:59:29,666 --> 00:59:31,517
- I can't be angry with you.
- Sit down.

909
00:59:31,541 --> 00:59:34,125
- I'm not your father. Don't say that.
- Sir.

910
00:59:34,208 --> 00:59:36,666
Stop calling me "sir!"
We're all friends here, right?

911
00:59:36,750 --> 00:59:39,333
- Get in! Come on, it's her birthday!
- Yes, sir.

912
00:59:40,333 --> 00:59:42,416
Why is this guy driving so slow?

913
00:59:43,750 --> 00:59:45,000
Oh, whoa!

914
00:59:50,041 --> 00:59:52,125

Just stuff those kids wear, sir.

945
01:02:35,166 --> 01:02:38,375
What was he doing
in the street at 2:00 in the morning?

946
01:02:38,458 --> 01:02:39,500
Exactly, sir.

947
01:02:40,166 --> 01:02:43,166
It's not our fault, sir.
He just jumped in our way, stupid kid.

948
01:02:44,083 --> 01:02:45,166
Don't call him stupid.

949
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:47,500

- What am I gonna do?
- Nothing, sir.

952
01:02:59,333 --> 01:03:03,125
You know how those people are?
Sometimes they have ten, 20 kids.

953
01:03:03,208 --> 01:03:05,083
Even they don't remember their names.

954
01:03:05,166 --> 01:03:07,833
- Nobody will miss this one, sir.
- Yeah, but…

955
01:03:09,583 --> 01:03:12,250
- What if someone reports it?
- Who, sir?

956
01:03:13,166 --> 01:03:14,500
The street was empty…

957
01:03:15,708 --> 01:03:17,958

958
01:03:18,041 --> 01:03:21,916
the police don't even let these kind
of people inside the station, sir.

959
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:25,833
- I shouldn't have listened to her.
- Sir, you don't take tension.

Don't worry, sir. I'm here.
I will take care of this.

Have you spoken with anyone

976
01:04:45,875 --> 01:04:48,416
No, sir.
I washed the car and went to bed.

01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:49,541
- Good.
- Yes, sir.

978
01:04:49,625 --> 01:04:52,208
It's important
that you not say a word to anyone.

979
01:04:52,291 --> 01:04:53,458
Yes, sir.

980
01:04:54,083 --> 01:04:56,375
- Would you like some <i>paan?</i>
- No, sir, I quit <i>paan.</i>

981

Come on! You still eat <i>paan, </i>I know it!

982
01:04:58,125 --> 01:05:00,791
No, really, sir!
Ashok Sir, tell them.

- I know you eat <i>paan.</i>
- Come on, sir.

984
01:05:02,708 --> 01:05:03,875
Open it.

985
01:05:09,583 --> 01:05:11,423
- Is it all right?
- It's very good!

986
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:13,142
The judge is taken care of.

987
01:05:13,166 --> 01:05:16,046
If your man does as he's supposed to,
you'll have nothing to worry about.

988
01:05:16,125 --> 01:05:17,916
My man will do what he's to do.

- Yes, sir.

- Of course he can read.

01:06:05,708 --> 01:06:10,333
"That I was alone
in the car and alone responsible."

1003
01:06:12,333 --> 01:06:14,166
We've already told your family.

1004
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:17,875
Your Granny, uh… What's her name?

1005
01:06:18,583 --> 01:06:19,583
Balram?

1006
01:06:20,708 --> 01:06:21,750
- Hey, Balram?
<i>- Ji, </i>sir?

1007
01:06:21,833 --> 01:06:23,291
What's her name? Uh…

1008
01:06:23,375 --> 01:06:25,166
- Kusum, sir.
- Kusum-<i>ji.</i>

1009
01:06:25,250 --> 01:06:28,750
I drove down to Laxmangarh,
explained her everything.

1010
01:06:28,833 --> 01:06:29,958
I met your brother.

1011
01:06:30,875 --> 01:06:32,333
Your entire family was there.

1012
01:06:33,125 --> 01:06:34,875
She's so proud of you for this,

1013
01:06:35,833 --> 01:06:38,375
and she agreed
to be a witness to your confession.

1014
01:06:40,083 --> 01:06:42,416
See? This is the thumb impression here.

1015
01:06:44,833 --> 01:06:46,166
Just sign above that.

1016
01:06:46,916 --> 01:06:48,767
If he doesn't know to write,
he can press his thumb.

1017
01:06:48,791 --> 01:06:51,166
He knows to write.
Stop treating him like an idiot!

1018
01:06:51,250 --> 01:06:52,125
Keep quiet, Ashok.

1019
01:06:52,208 --> 01:06:55,333
- We shouldn't do this. It's not right.
- Balram, sign.

1020
01:06:55,416 --> 01:06:58,125
Then you and Pinky go to the police
and tell them what happened.

1021
01:06:58,916 --> 01:07:02,125
If you understand law, then handle this.
Otherwise, just shut up!

1022
01:07:14,791 --> 01:07:16,666
Balram, just go on.

1023
01:07:20,875 --> 01:07:22,083
Balram, go on.

1024
01:07:22,708 --> 01:07:25,875
Go ahead and sign it, brother.
Right here.

1025
01:07:38,166 --> 01:07:40,041
Aren't you my brother? My younger brother?

1026
01:07:40,125 --> 01:07:40,958
Yes, sir.

1027
01:07:41,041 --> 01:07:42,750
We eat and hang out together.

1028
01:07:42,833 --> 01:07:45,791
Dad's here, I'm here.
Brother Ashok is right there.

1029
01:07:46,750 --> 01:07:49,541
- Is there anything to worry about?
- No, sir.

1030
01:07:49,666 --> 01:07:53,166
Huh?

1031
01:07:55,416 --> 01:07:56,250
Go on.

1032
01:07:56,333 --> 01:07:58,458
Just go and wait outside. We'll call you.

1033
01:08:01,291 --> 01:08:04,208
- All right? Go on.
- Go on.

1034
01:08:05,375 --> 01:08:06,375
All right, sir.

1035
01:08:11,416 --> 01:08:12,666
No need for that.

1036
01:10:04,333 --> 01:10:08,000
To think of this again
makes me so angry

1037
01:10:08,083 --> 01:10:11,916
that I might go out and cut the throat
of some rich man right now.

1038
01:10:18,416 --> 01:10:20,875
<i>Not once did I think I had options.</i>

1039
01:10:22,625 --> 01:10:27,375
<i>Not once did I think
I'll tell the judge the truth or run away.</i>

1040
01:10:30,166 --> 01:10:31,708
Give me Moonlight Whiskey.

1041
01:10:32,583 --> 01:10:34,601
<i>I was trapped in the rooster coop,</i>

1042
01:10:34,625 --> 01:10:37,833
<i>and don't believe for a second
there's a million-rupee game show</i>

1043
01:10:37,916 --> 01:10:39,750
<i>you can win to get out of it.</i>

1044
01:10:46,416 --> 01:10:48,458
<i>The world's greatest democracy.</i>

1045
01:10:56,583 --> 01:10:59,541
<i>For hundreds
of millions of people like me,</i>

1046
01:10:59,625 --> 01:11:01,833
<i>there is only one way to break free.</i>

1047
01:11:02,583 --> 01:11:05,458
<i>I would have to accept
what this man's family would do…</i>

1048
01:11:06,375 --> 01:11:08,833
<i>not just to me but to my family.</i>

1049
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:16,666
<i>And that takes no normal human being</i>

1050
01:11:16,750 --> 01:11:19,000
<i>but a freak, a pervert of nature.</i>

1051
01:11:20,541 --> 01:11:23,541
<i>It would, in fact, take a white tiger.</i>

1052
01:11:33,750 --> 01:11:34,791
Here you are!

1053
01:11:35,708 --> 01:11:37,958
Your boss
has been calling like crazy for you.

1054
01:11:38,708 --> 01:11:40,333
He came down here last night too.

1055
01:11:42,750 --> 01:11:43,750
Are you sick?

1056
01:11:44,583 --> 01:11:45,583
Typhoid?

1057
01:11:46,125 --> 01:11:48,166
Dengue? Malaria?

1058
01:11:50,416 --> 01:11:53,416
You seem to be in some big trouble.

1059
01:12:03,833 --> 01:12:05,250
Oy, jackass dick.

1060
01:12:05,333 --> 01:12:07,750
How many times do I have to call for you?

1061
01:12:07,833 --> 01:12:11,041
What're you staring at?
Get the bottle of oil, useless fucker.

1062
01:12:24,583 --> 01:12:26,041
This match looks fixed.

1063
01:12:26,125 --> 01:12:28,541
The cricketers
are taking shit out there.

1064
01:12:34,541 --> 01:12:35,541
You're back?

1065
01:12:36,083 --> 01:12:37,375
Come, sit down.

1066
01:12:37,458 --> 01:12:40,708
- Who's winning?
- See for yourself.

1067
01:12:40,791 --> 01:12:42,791
- We're losing.
- Balram.

1068
01:12:43,458 --> 01:12:44,458
Yeah.

1069
01:12:45,041 --> 01:12:46,208
Hey, Balram?

1070
01:12:47,208 --> 01:12:48,333
Have they told you?

1071
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:52,208
You haven't told him?

1072
01:12:52,291 --> 01:12:53,750
Hmm?

1073
01:12:55,333 --> 01:12:56,333
I got it.

1074
01:12:58,041 --> 01:12:59,041
Balram.

1075
01:12:59,916 --> 01:13:00,916
Um…

1076
01:13:03,541 --> 01:13:05,750
They have a contact at the police.

1077
01:13:08,166 --> 01:13:13,750
No one reported seeing what I did,
so they don't need you anymore.

1078
01:13:25,750 --> 01:13:28,708
There, there.
Enough of your drama. Massage my feet!

1079
01:13:29,458 --> 01:13:32,351
- Why would you kick him?
- He's fucking lazy!

1080
01:13:32,375 --> 01:13:34,135
Why would you hit him like that?

1081
01:13:34,166 --> 01:13:37,086
- Hey, Pinky, calm down.
- How can you do that? Like he doesn't...

1082
01:13:37,166 --> 01:13:39,625
Don't tell me to calm down.
It's like you don't care.

1083
01:13:39,708 --> 01:13:42,125
- Do you like it?
- Pinky, let go of him!

1084
01:13:42,208 --> 01:13:44,583
And nobody else matters
after what he does?

1085
01:13:44,666 --> 01:13:46,934
- You! Get away from me.
- It's all good now.

1086
01:13:46,958 --> 01:13:48,125
This is good?

1087
01:13:48,208 --> 01:13:49,500
And this shit?

1088
01:13:50,333 --> 01:13:51,333
I'm done.

1089
01:13:52,750 --> 01:13:54,166
I'm done with this.

1090
01:13:54,250 --> 01:13:57,226
She's looking for
the victim's family, to compensate them.

1091
01:13:57,250 --> 01:13:59,309
- What are we, murderers?
- She won't do that.

1092
01:13:59,333 --> 01:14:01,125
Dude, shut up.

1093
01:14:01,208 --> 01:14:03,666
She's gone crazy. Rein her in!

1094
01:14:17,125 --> 01:14:20,500
I have your confession
and will always have it.

1095
01:15:28,333 --> 01:15:30,958
Hey, brother.
Can you give me something to eat?

1096
01:15:31,041 --> 01:15:34,000
- Move along.
- I haven't eaten anything in days.

1097
01:15:34,083 --> 01:15:35,958
I don't have anything, move along.

1098
01:15:36,041 --> 01:15:38,833
You must have a rupee,
please give it to me, brother.

1099
01:15:38,916 --> 01:15:40,666
- Move along.
- Where should I go?

1100
01:15:40,750 --> 01:15:43,291
I told you to move along!
Does your head not work?

1101
01:15:43,375 --> 01:15:46,750
You want this? Should I take
my clothes off and give them to you?

1102
01:15:46,833 --> 01:15:48,083
You want me to get naked?

1103
01:15:48,166 --> 01:15:51,125
- Maybe something to eat…
- This woman is driving me insane!

1104
01:15:51,208 --> 01:15:53,125
Give me something to eat…

1105
01:15:53,208 --> 01:15:56,208
I've earned 36 rupees in six months.
Shall I give it all to you?

1106
01:15:56,291 --> 01:15:57,791
Then what should I eat?

1107
01:15:57,875 --> 01:16:00,083
Give me some food, my child.

1108
01:16:00,166 --> 01:16:01,833
This woman has gone crazy!

1109
01:16:01,916 --> 01:16:04,791
Get her out of here. She's lost her mind.

1110
01:16:05,916 --> 01:16:07,750
Arrest her! You are the police!

1111
01:16:22,666 --> 01:16:23,706
Balram.

1112
01:16:28,291 --> 01:16:29,666
I need you to drive me.

1113
01:16:52,791 --> 01:16:54,916
You were looking
for the key for years,

1114
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,750
but the door was always open.

1115
01:17:00,333 --> 01:17:02,041
Did you say something, madam?

1116
01:18:00,250 --> 01:18:02,000
Flight?

1117
01:18:02,083 --> 01:18:05,333
- What flight? What?
- I really don't know, sir, what flight.

1118
01:18:06,416 --> 01:18:08,000
- Why didn't you wake me up?
- Sir...

1119
01:18:08,083 --> 01:18:10,583
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Sir, I did what she asked me to.

1120
01:18:11,416 --> 01:18:13,208
Why would you drop her behind my back?

1121
01:18:14,166 --> 01:18:16,142
- Why would you do that?
- Sir, you can't blame me.

1122
01:18:16,166 --> 01:18:18,458
Who should I blame then? You're my driver!

1123
01:18:18,541 --> 01:18:21,083
I've never heard
of a woman leaving her husband, sir.

1124
01:18:22,208 --> 01:18:24,833
- She has not left me.
- Sir, don't hit me.

1125
01:18:24,916 --> 01:18:26,583
- She hasn't left me.
- Sir, don't hit me.

1126
01:18:26,666 --> 01:18:28,708
She'd never leave me, you piece of shit.

1127
01:18:28,791 --> 01:18:30,000
- My collar...
- Where's Pinky?

1128
01:18:30,083 --> 01:18:31,458
- Sir, leave my...
- Where's...

1129
01:18:31,541 --> 01:18:32,791
Sir, leave my collar!

1130
01:18:51,291 --> 01:18:53,000
I wish they had put you in jail.

1131
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,750
<i>I waited two days
for my master to call me.</i>

1132
01:19:17,750 --> 01:19:20,375
<i>Had he gone back to America
and not told me?</i>

1133
01:19:38,958 --> 01:19:40,041
Are you okay, sir?

1134
01:19:41,500 --> 01:19:43,750
Why didn't you pack up and leave too?

1135
01:19:49,583 --> 01:19:52,500
Sir, it is not good
to starve yourself like this.

1136
01:19:53,833 --> 01:19:54,750
Sir, should I...

1137
01:19:54,833 --> 01:19:57,125
The whole fucking thing was her fault.

1138
01:19:58,875 --> 01:20:00,291
Fucking bitch.

1139
01:20:01,291 --> 01:20:03,000
Should I call for pizza, sir?

1140
01:20:18,833 --> 01:20:20,041
Feeling better, sir?

1141
01:20:22,291 --> 01:20:24,000
You must believe in God, sir.

1142
01:20:25,666 --> 01:20:29,583
My Granny says if you believe in God,
then good things will happen.

1143
01:20:32,833 --> 01:20:34,708
Why are you so kind to me, Balram?

1144
01:20:37,291 --> 01:20:38,458
It is my duty, sir.

1145
01:20:45,125 --> 01:20:47,250
Sir, I made some <i>nimbu pani </i>for you.

1146
01:20:47,958 --> 01:20:49,958
Have this, you'll feel <i>ekdum </i>fresh, sir.

1147
01:20:56,083 --> 01:20:57,083
Ashok Sir?

1148
01:20:59,583 --> 01:21:00,583
Ashok Sir?

1149
01:21:03,541 --> 01:21:04,583
Ashok Sir?

1150
01:21:18,583 --> 01:21:21,583
<i>Do we loathe our masters
behind a facade of love,</i>

1151
01:21:22,375 --> 01:21:25,291
<i>or do we love them
behind a facade of loathing?</i>

1152
01:21:47,375 --> 01:21:49,333
Where's Pinky?

1153
01:21:50,375 --> 01:21:52,041
You need to sleep, sir.

1154
01:21:53,500 --> 01:21:55,166
Don't leave, Balram, okay?

1155
01:21:56,166 --> 01:21:57,375
I'm right here, sir.

1156
01:22:32,125 --> 01:22:34,333
"Why are you so kind to me, Balram?"

1157
01:23:02,916 --> 01:23:08,166
<i>With Pinky Madam gone, I knew
it was my duty to be like a wife to him.</i>

1158
01:23:08,250 --> 01:23:11,375
<i>I didn't let him drink,
and I lifted his spirits.</i>

1159
01:23:13,291 --> 01:23:16,251
Once you have the
food here, sir, you'll never forget it.

1160
01:23:20,333 --> 01:23:21,500
This is amazing.

1161
01:23:24,833 --> 01:23:27,059
From now on,
I'll only eat your kind of food.

1162
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,041
<i>And I only want
to eat your kind of food.</i>

1163
01:23:30,125 --> 01:23:32,166
You know
the real India better than me.

1164
01:23:32,250 --> 01:23:33,333
You know, my mom,

1165
01:23:34,250 --> 01:23:37,833
she was the one who encouraged me
to go to America and study.

1166
01:23:40,083 --> 01:23:41,458
Pinky really loved her.

1167
01:23:50,125 --> 01:23:53,041
You know, sir, Pinky Madam told me
that you are a great man

1168
01:23:53,125 --> 01:23:55,458
who is going to do
great things in India, sir.

1169
01:23:56,625 --> 01:23:59,541
- When did she say that?
- The morning she left.

1170
01:24:00,125 --> 01:24:03,083
She was crying the entire way
to the airport, sir.

1171
01:24:04,500 --> 01:24:07,375
And she told me that you will not
let Mukesh Sir tell you what to do.

1172
01:24:08,791 --> 01:24:10,583
And that she believes in you.

1173
01:24:28,541 --> 01:24:30,291
She'll come back to you, sir.

1174
01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:32,500
Yeah.

1175
01:24:33,166 --> 01:24:35,708
She's coming back. I can feel it.

1176
01:24:36,291 --> 01:24:37,666
I can feel it, too, sir.

1177
01:25:10,125 --> 01:25:11,291
How are you?

1178
01:25:12,666 --> 01:25:13,708
Go get the car.

1179
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:15,666
Get the car.

1180
01:25:19,791 --> 01:25:20,791
Divorce?

1181
01:25:22,083 --> 01:25:23,083
She said that?

1182
01:25:23,708 --> 01:25:26,668
- Don't worry. I'm handling it.
- You're probably happy she's gone.

1183
01:25:26,708 --> 01:25:29,541
That's not true.
I want your happiness, <i>bhai.</i>

1184
01:25:29,625 --> 01:25:32,791
- I'm gonna go there and talk to her.
- Wait, stop. Ashok.

1185
01:25:32,875 --> 01:25:36,375
- No, I need to talk to her...
- You can't call her like this.

1186
01:25:37,041 --> 01:25:39,541
Stop pleading like this. You'll regret it.

1187
01:25:41,458 --> 01:25:44,333
The only thing I regret
is letting her drive that night.

1188
01:25:45,166 --> 01:25:47,666
- It's not your fault. You know.
- It is my fault.

1189
01:25:47,750 --> 01:25:50,041
Listen, I can stay
with you as long as you like.

1190
01:25:50,500 --> 01:25:54,083
Let me order that pizza which you like,
that macaroni one.

1191
01:25:55,166 --> 01:25:56,958
I'm sorry, <i>bhai. </i>Without you, I'd…

1192
01:25:59,333 --> 01:26:01,416
Look what I brought for you, sir.

1193
01:26:01,500 --> 01:26:03,208
Nice and hot okra.

1194
01:26:03,291 --> 01:26:06,611
- I don't want food right now.
- Just like we had the other night, sir.

1195
01:26:07,166 --> 01:26:09,125
Nice and crispy, check it out.

1196
01:26:09,208 --> 01:26:10,528
I don't give a shit.

1197
01:26:11,250 --> 01:26:13,166
Don't say that. Have a little bit.

1198
01:26:13,250 --> 01:26:14,500
I'm not hungry!

1199
01:26:16,458 --> 01:26:17,958
Get lost, please.

1200
01:26:18,916 --> 01:26:21,017
He doesn't feel like it.
Why're you up in his ass?

1201
01:26:21,041 --> 01:26:22,201
Get rid of it, sister-fucker!

1202
01:26:22,250 --> 01:26:24,610
Can you just
leave me alone for a second?

1203
01:26:24,833 --> 01:26:27,666
Until Ashok Sir calls you,
don't hover like a fly!

1204
01:26:28,291 --> 01:26:29,291
Yes, sir.

1205
01:26:44,541 --> 01:26:48,041
<i>The desire to be
a servant had been bred into me,</i>

1206
01:26:48,125 --> 01:26:51,458
<i>poured into my blood,
hammered into my skull.</i>

1207
01:26:53,500 --> 01:26:56,583
<i>Ninety-three hundred rupees,
a strange sum,</i>

1208
01:26:57,083 --> 01:26:59,958
<i>almost three months my salary
but not quite.</i>

1209
01:27:01,916 --> 01:27:05,000
<i>Maybe she started with 10,000
and then deducted 700?</i>

1210
01:27:05,083 --> 01:27:06,208
<i>No, no, no.</i>

1211
01:27:06,291 --> 01:27:08,291
That is not how rich people think.

1212
01:27:08,375 --> 01:27:11,500
Have you not
learned anything, you idiot?

1213
01:27:11,583 --> 01:27:15,333
If she thought she owed you 10,000,
she truly owed you ten times more.

1214
01:27:15,416 --> 01:27:18,833
Ten times more. No! A hundred times more.
A hundred times more.

1215
01:27:22,250 --> 01:27:26,666
They made me sign that confession,
and I asked for nothing in return.

1216
01:27:27,916 --> 01:27:30,625
Why did I not ask?
I didn't even think to ask.

1217
01:27:32,125 --> 01:27:33,625
I didn't even think to ask.

1218
01:27:38,375 --> 01:27:42,000
Have you ever thought about
what happens to you in the future?

1219
01:27:42,958 --> 01:27:43,958
Eyes.

1220
01:27:44,291 --> 01:27:47,083
As long as you have eyes, you'll work.

1221
01:27:47,166 --> 01:27:50,541
But when you turn 50-55,
they'll kick your ass out.

1222
01:27:51,333 --> 01:27:52,333
And then?

1223
01:27:53,083 --> 01:27:55,916
If you've saved some money,
you can buy a little shack.

1224
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:59,708
But if you're clever like me
and earn extra money, then maybe more.

1225
01:28:00,416 --> 01:28:02,416
That's the best case scenario.

1226
01:28:02,500 --> 01:28:05,583
Imagine your boss
kicks you out without any reason.

1227
01:28:05,666 --> 01:28:07,125
Or you get into an accident!

1228
01:28:07,791 --> 01:28:08,791
You'll be dead!

1229
01:28:09,291 --> 01:28:10,583
Or homeless.

1230
01:28:17,291 --> 01:28:18,500
Hey, Country Mouse…

1231
01:28:20,541 --> 01:28:21,791
Everything's fine?

1232
01:28:21,875 --> 01:28:22,958
First class.

1233
01:28:24,708 --> 01:28:28,041
I hate to tell you this,
but all the drivers are talking about you.

1234
01:28:28,583 --> 01:28:31,000
That you sit in your boss' car alone…

1235
01:28:32,125 --> 01:28:34,000
muttering away to yourself.

1236
01:28:36,125 --> 01:28:37,125
Is it true?

1237
01:28:45,375 --> 01:28:47,255
<i>I would not let him tell me…</i>

1238
01:28:48,875 --> 01:28:51,250
<i>my fate was a shack in a slum.</i>

1239
01:28:57,208 --> 01:29:01,833
<i>Over the next weeks, I learned the ways
drivers cheat their masters.</i>

1240
01:29:10,958 --> 01:29:13,916
<i>Number one,
give your master phony invoices</i>

1241
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,083
<i>for repairs that are not necessary.</i>

1242
01:29:18,458 --> 01:29:19,458
Thank you, sir.

1243
01:29:24,208 --> 01:29:27,583
<i>Two, sell your master's petrol
to other drivers.</i>

1244
01:29:32,750 --> 01:29:34,166
<i>As you gain confidence,</i>

1245
01:29:34,250 --> 01:29:37,208
<i>cruise around picking up
and dropping off paying customers.</i>

1246
01:29:38,375 --> 01:29:39,875
<i>Delhi has many pickup points.</i>

1247
01:29:40,541 --> 01:29:42,708
<i>Over time, you will learn them all.</i>

1248
01:29:44,833 --> 01:29:47,708
<i>When I looked
at that cash, I didn't feel guilt.</i>

1249
01:29:48,875 --> 01:29:50,375
<i>I felt rage.</i>

1250
01:29:52,291 --> 01:29:54,375
<i>There are only two castes in India.</i>

1251
01:29:55,166 --> 01:29:57,166
<i>I was growing a belly at last.</i>

1252
01:29:57,250 --> 01:29:59,750
Ashok Sir,
I'll fuck your mother.

1253
01:30:01,041 --> 01:30:03,375
I'm trying to drive.
I can't pay attention like this.

1254
01:30:03,458 --> 01:30:04,500
Take this.

1255
01:30:05,583 --> 01:30:06,625
Take it!

1256
01:30:06,708 --> 01:30:09,875
You're a eunuch,
you motherfucker! A eunuch!

1257
01:30:16,291 --> 01:30:18,083
I know what you were doing.

1258
01:30:18,166 --> 01:30:20,166
Sir, please don't get upset with me.

1259
01:30:20,250 --> 01:30:23,041
You were at the temple
offering prayers for my health.

1260
01:30:23,708 --> 01:30:24,708
Yes, sir.

1261
01:30:26,166 --> 01:30:28,291
Yes, sir. I was so worried for you, sir.

1262
01:30:29,583 --> 01:30:31,916
I made an offering
of 101 rupees in your name.

1263
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:33,541
Come inside. Sit with me.

1264
01:30:34,291 --> 01:30:35,291
Come.

1265
01:30:37,416 --> 01:30:38,458
Come here.

1266
01:30:40,541 --> 01:30:42,500
Is this really where you live?

1267
01:30:43,583 --> 01:30:46,833
It's so damp, and the smell…

1268
01:30:47,541 --> 01:30:49,833
This place is like
the Taj Mahal for me, sir.

1269
01:30:49,916 --> 01:30:51,375
- Taj Mahal…
- Yes, sir.

1270
01:30:51,458 --> 01:30:54,583
Taj Mahal is a tomb, Balram.
You don't live in Taj Mahal.

1271
01:30:56,208 --> 01:30:57,208
Okay, sir.

1272
01:30:58,333 --> 01:31:01,000
I have never done
what I wanted to do with my life.

1273
01:31:02,125 --> 01:31:03,583
What did you want to do, sir?

1274
01:31:03,666 --> 01:31:05,125
Music.

1275
01:31:06,625 --> 01:31:08,166
Or produce it anyway.

1276
01:31:09,333 --> 01:31:11,875
You know,
I lived in the US for so many years,

1277
01:31:11,958 --> 01:31:13,833
and I'd try to be like them.

1278
01:31:14,583 --> 01:31:17,708
But I'm fucking
Indian at heart, after all.

1279
01:31:17,791 --> 01:31:18,916
Absolutely, sir.

1280
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:20,916
But we're fucking Indians.

1281
01:31:22,541 --> 01:31:25,625
I want to go to Bangalore
and change my country's future.

1282
01:31:25,708 --> 01:31:26,958
That's what I want to do.

1283
01:31:27,041 --> 01:31:29,916
Sir, you can do anything you want, sir.

1284
01:31:31,625 --> 01:31:34,305
- Sir, you are a man of quality.
- Man of quality.

1285
01:31:36,083 --> 01:31:37,208

1292
01:32:05,375 --> 01:32:07,791
Sir, I never knew
you could sing like this.

1293
01:32:07,875 --> 01:32:10,208
- I try.
- No, sir. Really, sir.

1294
01:32:10,291 --> 01:32:12,708
I also dabble in singing, sir.

1295
01:32:12,791 --> 01:32:14,125

- Yes, sir.

1296
01:32:14,708 --> 01:32:17,291
Come on, sing it for me. Yeah.

1297
01:32:18,166 --> 01:32:20,166
All right, sir.
I'll sing a little bit.

1298
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:22,833

1310
01:33:03,916 --> 01:33:05,708
Yes, sir, absolutely, sir.

1311
01:33:06,708 --> 01:33:09,750
I wish I had

01:33:15,666 --> 01:33:17,125
You're so sweet.

<i>I see you've arrived

1316
01:33:31,666 --> 01:33:34,750
<i>Perhaps we can have
a drink when you visit Bangalore.</i>

1317
01:33:34,833 --> 01:33:38,416
<i>You know, I would not be able to afford
even one Johnnie Walker Black</i>

1318
01:33:38,500 --> 01:33:40,875
<i>with the money I cheated
from my ex-employer,</i>

1319
01:33:40,958 --> 01:33:44,833
<i>or get a room in this five-star hotel
with the money Pinky Madam had given me.</i>

1320
01:33:46,875 --> 01:33:51,291
<i>Men born in the light, like my master,
have the choice to be good.</i>

1321
01:33:52,708 --> 01:33:57,583
<i>Men born in the coop, like me,
we don't have that choice.</i>

1322
01:33:58,416 --> 01:34:00,351
<i>The opposition party and underdog,</i>

1323
01:34:00,375 --> 01:34:03,291
<i>the Great Socialist,
hopes for support from rural India.</i>

1324
01:34:03,375 --> 01:34:04,708
Her party is a mess.

1325
01:34:04,791 --> 01:34:07,041
This government is
going to win this time for sure.

1326
01:34:07,125 --> 01:34:09,205
We just need to keep paying them
until the elections.

1327
01:34:09,250 --> 01:34:10,583
I can't keep doing this.

1328
01:34:10,666 --> 01:34:13,184
Things will change,
and then you do what you want to do.

1329
01:34:13,208 --> 01:34:15,684
- It's getting tough.
- What the fuck was that?

1330
01:34:15,708 --> 01:34:18,250
Who told you
to do that? Can you believe that?

1331
01:34:18,333 --> 01:34:19,733
Why did you give him money, Balram?

1332
01:34:19,791 --> 01:34:21,309
Turn off the radio, asshole!

1333
01:34:21,333 --> 01:34:23,708
This sister-fucker thinks
he's doing charity.

1334
01:34:23,791 --> 01:34:24,892
Why'd he do that?

1335
01:34:24,916 --> 01:34:26,434
Is that your father's money, dickhead?

1336
01:34:26,458 --> 01:34:30,875
- Who do you think you are?
- Sorry, sir. It won't happen again.

1337
01:34:35,583 --> 01:34:37,958
<i>Be careful
what you say around drivers.</i>

1338
01:34:38,041 --> 01:34:40,375
<i>We have grown skilled at reading lips.</i>

1339
01:34:40,458 --> 01:34:43,000
<i>I was certain
I saw the Mongoose say my name,</i>

1340
01:34:43,083 --> 01:34:45,291
<i>and then a word no servant wants to hear,</i>

1341
01:34:45,916 --> 01:34:47,208
<i>"replacement."</i>

1342
01:34:54,208 --> 01:34:55,958
- To the Parliament House.
<i>- Ji, </i>sir.

1343
01:34:58,541 --> 01:34:59,708
My phone.

1344
01:35:00,583 --> 01:35:02,041
Just keep it in the car.

1345
01:35:25,125 --> 01:35:27,833
<i>This was at least
two years' salary, maybe three.</i>

1346
01:35:28,916 --> 01:35:30,208
<i>I was worth more.</i>

1347
01:35:51,041 --> 01:35:54,541
<i>Over the next days,
I tried hard not to look at the red bag.</i>

1348
01:36:00,583 --> 01:36:03,541
<i>The city knew
something was burning inside of me,</i>

1349
01:36:03,625 --> 01:36:05,166
<i>and she burned too.</i>

1350
01:36:20,875 --> 01:36:21,875
Dad?

1351
01:36:23,958 --> 01:36:27,375
Even if you were to steal it…
it wouldn't be stealing.

1352
01:36:27,458 --> 01:36:31,375
Mr. Ashok bribes politicians
in order not to pay taxes.

1353
01:36:31,458 --> 01:36:33,041
So who is he stealing from?

1354
01:36:33,125 --> 01:36:35,166
The ordinary people of this country.

1355
01:36:36,750 --> 01:36:37,750
Me.

1356
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:40,000
And you.

1357
01:36:43,541 --> 01:36:44,661
Let's go.

1358
01:36:45,666 --> 01:36:47,541
Balram, hey? Let's go.

1359
01:36:53,583 --> 01:36:55,125
It'll be a couple of hours.

1360
01:37:23,583 --> 01:37:27,375
<i>What would my destination be
if I came here with the red bag?</i>

1361
01:37:34,541 --> 01:37:36,875
<i>The pigeons, the dog, the station.</i>

1362
01:37:36,958 --> 01:37:38,250
<i>They could sense it.</i>

1363
01:37:38,333 --> 01:37:41,625
<i>A rooster was trying
to escape from the coop.</i>

1364
01:37:44,041 --> 01:37:46,750
<i>What would Mr. Ashok do to my family?</i>

1365
01:38:43,083 --> 01:38:44,625
- Sir?
- Yeah?

1366
01:38:49,583 --> 01:38:51,125
Sir, there is something…

1367
01:38:53,541 --> 01:38:55,666
There is something
I want to tell you, sir.

1368
01:38:56,375 --> 01:38:57,500
Yeah. Go ahead.

1369
01:39:00,541 --> 01:39:04,000
Sir, I want to smash your skull
and steal your money.

1370
01:39:06,208 --> 01:39:07,875
I know what you're thinking.

1371
01:39:08,958 --> 01:39:10,458
You miss home, don't you?

1372
01:39:11,625 --> 01:39:12,625
Yes, sir.

1373
01:39:13,416 --> 01:39:14,625
Plan a trip back.

1374
01:39:16,208 --> 01:39:17,208
And…

1375
01:39:20,958 --> 01:39:23,541
Don't worry about the expenses. Here.

1376
01:39:25,416 --> 01:39:27,625
- Yeah? Good night.
- Yes, sir.

1377
01:39:35,958 --> 01:39:39,541
<i>He only gave me
enough for a one-way ticket.</i>

1378
01:40:43,916 --> 01:40:45,434
<i>Upending all expectations</i>

1379
01:40:45,458 --> 01:40:47,559
<i>and with the support of the poor…</i>

1380
01:40:47,583 --> 01:40:51,125
<i>…the Great Socialist has won
a vast majority of the votes</i>

1381
01:40:51,208 --> 01:40:53,083
<i>saying, "There is no water in our taps,</i>

1382
01:40:53,166 --> 01:40:55,750
<i>and what did
the rich politicians in Delhi give us?"</i>

1383
01:40:55,833 --> 01:40:56,666
<i>"Cellphones."</i>

1384
01:40:56,750 --> 01:40:59,250
<i>"Can a poor man drink
a phone when he is thirsty?"</i>

1385
01:40:59,333 --> 01:41:00,642
We went to the wrong side.

1386
01:41:00,666 --> 01:41:02,976
Turn that shit off, asshole!

1387
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,208
I can't hear you. Say that again?

1388
01:41:05,291 --> 01:41:07,541
I get it. Move! Back off!

1389
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:13,000
Yeah. All the idiot villagers
voted for her.

1390
01:41:13,791 --> 01:41:15,541
What the fuck are we gonna do now?

1391
01:41:16,125 --> 01:41:18,416
Drive, sister-fucker!
Why'd you come this way?

1392
01:41:22,041 --> 01:41:25,250
Long live socialism!

1393
01:41:41,083 --> 01:41:43,375
Father sends
his warm congratulations.

1394
01:41:43,458 --> 01:41:45,625
We're all very happy for your success.

1395
01:41:45,708 --> 01:41:47,291
So sweet of you.

1396
01:41:48,500 --> 01:41:52,083
As a matter of fact, we would like
to show our appreciation by donating

1397
01:41:52,166 --> 01:41:54,041
one million rupees to your party.

1398
01:41:54,750 --> 01:41:57,583
Is that how much you paid
the opposition party, fucker?

1399
01:41:58,833 --> 01:42:02,416
We want four million rupees.
Monday night, Sheraton Hotel.

1400
01:42:02,500 --> 01:42:03,500
Got it?

1401
01:42:36,791 --> 01:42:40,666
I took a bus
from the village, then caught a train…

1402
01:42:42,041 --> 01:42:44,583
and got here
after asking around about you.

1403
01:42:45,333 --> 01:42:49,291
Granny said you would look after me

1404
01:42:49,375 --> 01:42:51,250
and help me become a driver.

1405
01:42:55,208 --> 01:42:56,666
- Who are you?
- Dharam.

1406
01:42:57,416 --> 01:42:59,041
Aunt Lattu's fourth son.

1407
01:43:00,791 --> 01:43:02,500
- What's in your hand?
- A letter.

1408
01:43:02,583 --> 01:43:04,625
- A letter?
- Hmm.

1409
01:43:04,708 --> 01:43:05,750
Show it to me.

1410
01:43:14,875 --> 01:43:20,708
<i>My dear grandson,
it has been seven months and two days…</i>

1411
01:43:20,791 --> 01:43:22,791
since you sent us money.

1412
01:43:22,875 --> 01:43:25,791
The city has corrupted your soul.

1413
01:43:26,333 --> 01:43:31,000
Life has become hard here.
Lord Indra is unhappy.

1414
01:43:31,625 --> 01:43:35,166
You must send us money again.

1415
01:43:36,166 --> 01:43:40,166
I have arranged for your wedding.

1416
01:43:40,250 --> 01:43:46,541
If you don't come here,
we will send the girl to you by bus.

1417
01:43:46,625 --> 01:43:48,750
<i>If you refuse,</i>

1418
01:43:48,833 --> 01:43:52,833
<i>we will write a letter explaining
everything and send it to your master.</i>

1419
01:43:57,333 --> 01:43:59,458
Is she really
going to marry me off?

1420
01:44:00,125 --> 01:44:01,365
Yes, uncle.

1421
01:44:02,375 --> 01:44:04,791
Turn around, I'm going to hit you again.

1422
01:44:06,458 --> 01:44:07,541
Turn around!

1423
01:44:33,750 --> 01:44:37,041
<i>The next morning,
Mr. Ashok did something he had never done.</i>

1424
01:44:37,125 --> 01:44:37,958
Who is this?

1425
01:44:38,041 --> 01:44:39,916
<i>He gave me a day off.</i>

1426
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,208
- Your nephew?
<i>- Ji, </i>sir. My family.

1427
01:44:44,041 --> 01:44:47,916
<i>But by now, I knew
the rich never give anything for free.</i>

1428
01:44:53,583 --> 01:44:55,208
<i>He had found my replacement.</i>

1429
01:45:16,250 --> 01:45:20,500
<i>That's when we saw the creature that
gets born only once every generation…</i>

1430
01:45:22,458 --> 01:45:23,833
<i>the white tiger.</i>

1431
01:46:09,708 --> 01:46:13,250
<i>Iqbal, that great Muslim poet,
was right when he wrote,</i>

1432
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:17,250
<i>"The moment you recognize
what is beautiful in this world,</i>

1433
01:46:18,041 --> 01:46:19,458
<i>you stop being a slave."</i>

1434
01:47:32,958 --> 01:47:36,291
<i>I hoped the next morning
when I didn't return,</i>

1435
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:38,291
<i>he'd know to run.</i>

1436
01:48:13,041 --> 01:48:14,166
The Sheraton, sir?

1437
01:48:15,333 --> 01:48:17,208
Yeah, the Sheraton.

1438
01:48:26,875 --> 01:48:27,875
Pinky called.

1439
01:48:28,333 --> 01:48:30,708
She wants to know
if I'll move back to New York.

1440
01:48:32,458 --> 01:48:33,875
Will you be going, sir?

1441
01:48:34,375 --> 01:48:38,166
And pretend to be someone I'm not?
This is my country after all.

1442
01:48:44,750 --> 01:48:48,500
There is a story about a cunning Brahmin
trying to trick the Buddha?

1443
01:48:49,791 --> 01:48:51,000
The Brahmin asks,

1444
01:48:52,041 --> 01:48:55,500
"Master, do you consider
yourself man or God?"

1445
01:48:56,875 --> 01:48:59,625
To which the Buddha smiles
and says, "Neither."

1446
01:49:00,375 --> 01:49:05,125
"I'm just one who has woken up
while the rest of you are still sleeping."

1447
01:49:33,791 --> 01:49:35,875
What's wrong? Why'd you stop?

1448
01:49:35,958 --> 01:49:38,125
There is something wrong
with the wheel, sir.

1449
01:49:38,208 --> 01:49:40,750
Just give me a minute, sir. I'll go check.

1450
01:49:40,833 --> 01:49:41,833
Okay.

1451
01:50:09,541 --> 01:50:12,166
- What happened?
- There's something off with the wheel.

1452
01:50:12,666 --> 01:50:13,666
Okay.

1453
01:50:15,166 --> 01:50:16,583
Maybe we should call for help.

1454
01:50:16,666 --> 01:50:18,541
- Huh, sir?
- We should call for help!

1455
01:50:18,625 --> 01:50:20,416
Sir, who will come here, sir?

1456
01:50:21,333 --> 01:50:23,453
If you can just step out, sir,
we can fix it together.

1457
01:50:23,500 --> 01:50:25,541
No, no. It's raining. Let's call for help.

1458
01:50:25,625 --> 01:50:28,291
What to do, sir?
You will get late otherwise.

1459
01:50:28,375 --> 01:50:30,833
If you can just step outside,
it won't take much time.

1460
01:50:32,833 --> 01:50:33,833
Okay.

1461
01:50:37,833 --> 01:50:38,833
Ugh.

1462
01:50:39,750 --> 01:50:41,625
- Be careful about the bottle.
- Yeah.

1463
01:50:43,208 --> 01:50:45,125
I'll just put it out of the way.

1464
01:50:46,500 --> 01:50:47,875
- This one?
- Yes, sir.

1465
01:50:55,958 --> 01:50:57,708
- It seems fine to me.
- No, sir.

1466
01:50:57,791 --> 01:51:00,833
You should've found
a replacement a long time ago!

1467
01:54:25,916 --> 01:54:27,250
<i>I am not a politician.</i>

1468
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:31,541
<i>They are extraordinary men
who can kill and move on.</i>

1469
01:54:32,291 --> 01:54:36,916
<i>Not me. I didn't leave this room
for four weeks until my nerves were calm.</i>

1470
01:54:39,416 --> 01:54:41,666
<i>The last stage in my amazing success story</i>

1471
01:54:41,750 --> 01:54:45,083
<i>was to go from social entrepreneur
to business entrepreneur.</i>

1472
01:54:45,583 --> 01:54:46,666
<i>This was not easy.</i>

1473
01:54:49,375 --> 01:54:50,541
<i>But I had an edge.</i>

1474
01:54:50,625 --> 01:54:53,750
<i>I had come to Bangalore,
and Mr. Ashok had told me the future.</i>

1475
01:54:54,750 --> 01:54:56,083
<i>Outsourcing.</i>

1476
01:55:10,666 --> 01:55:12,625
<i>When I saw all those drivers</i>

1477
01:55:12,708 --> 01:55:15,375
<i>coming in and out
of the call centers to America,</i>

1478
01:55:16,083 --> 01:55:17,791
<i>I knew what my place would be.</i>

1479
01:55:20,291 --> 01:55:22,625
<i>But how would I
get rid of the competition?</i>

1480
01:55:26,833 --> 01:55:29,708
<i>Then I wondered,
"What would Mr. Ashok do?"</i>

1481
01:55:30,625 --> 01:55:31,625
Sir!

1482
01:55:34,291 --> 01:55:35,291
<i>Namaste, </i>sir.

1483
01:55:36,208 --> 01:55:39,541
I just wanted to make
a small offering of my gratitude to you.

1484
01:55:41,041 --> 01:55:42,041
For what?

1485
01:55:42,416 --> 01:55:44,583
For all the good
you're going to do for me.

1486
01:55:51,583 --> 01:55:55,041
<i>Don't worry.
It wasn't all of it, but it was enough.</i>

1487
01:55:57,375 --> 01:55:59,333
<i>You know why they never found me?</i>

1488
01:55:59,416 --> 01:56:02,500
<i>Because my face could be
the face of half the men in India.</i>

1489
01:56:05,875 --> 01:56:10,291
<i>The police arrested all the call-center
drivers for expired licenses.</i>

1490
01:56:11,208 --> 01:56:13,625
<i>Entrepreneurs create opportunity.</i>

1491
01:56:14,166 --> 01:56:16,000
<i>That's how I got my own startup.</i>

1492
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:19,625
<i>White Tiger Drivers.</i>

1493
01:56:20,708 --> 01:56:24,458
<i>I've got 30 drivers
who work in shifts with 26 vehicles,</i>

1494
01:56:24,541 --> 01:56:27,041
<i>all air-conditioned for the summer months.</i>

1495
01:56:28,250 --> 01:56:30,333
<i>Put together with my bank holdings,</i>

1496
01:56:30,416 --> 01:56:34,416
<i>and I am worth 15 times the sum
I borrowed from Mr. Ashok.</i>

1497
01:56:36,708 --> 01:56:38,875
<i>Your Excellency, please visit my website.</i>

1498
01:56:38,958 --> 01:56:41,875
<i>If you like what you see,
you can click where it says…</i>

1499
01:56:45,166 --> 01:56:46,416
Yes, Ashok.

1500
01:56:47,208 --> 01:56:49,458
That's what I call myself these days.

1501
01:56:51,416 --> 01:56:54,125
<i>But I don't treat
my drivers like servants.</i>

1502
01:56:54,208 --> 01:56:58,750
<i>I don't care about their religion,
and I certainly don't call them my family.</i>

1503
01:56:58,833 --> 01:57:00,708
<i>They are my employees.</i>

1504
01:57:00,791 --> 01:57:03,708
<i>I make them sign a contract,
and I sign it too.</i>

1505
01:57:05,500 --> 01:57:08,041
<i>And if there is a problem,</i>

1506
01:57:08,125 --> 01:57:10,166
<i>I don't let my drivers take the blame.</i>

1507
01:57:10,250 --> 01:57:11,601
Can't we take him to the hospital?

1508
01:57:11,625 --> 01:57:13,166
That's the brother of the dead boy.

1509
01:57:13,791 --> 01:57:15,708
And your driver
that hit him is right there.

1510
01:57:15,791 --> 01:57:17,708
<i>Namaskar, </i>my name is Ashok Sharma.

1511
01:57:17,791 --> 01:57:22,166
I am the owner of this vehicle.
The blood is on my hands, not my driver.

1512
01:57:22,250 --> 01:57:25,083
It's a terrible tragedy
that has happened, but it's late…

1513
01:57:25,166 --> 01:57:28,083
<i>I choose to do things
differently than my masters.</i>

1514
01:57:29,125 --> 01:57:30,416
<i>I live in the light now.</i>

1515
01:57:31,333 --> 01:57:34,625
I want to express my deep sorrow
at the loss of your son, aunty.

1516
01:57:34,708 --> 01:57:36,708
There is 40,000 rupees in this.

1517
01:57:36,791 --> 01:57:39,958
I don't give it to you
because I need to, but because I want to.

1518
01:57:40,041 --> 01:57:41,561
Do you understand?

1519
01:57:41,958 --> 01:57:43,798
And I want to help your other son.

1520
01:57:44,333 --> 01:57:48,375
He can come and be a driver with me,
and I will take care of him.

1521
01:57:56,458 --> 01:57:58,500
<i>I do think about my ex a lot,</i>

1522
01:57:59,583 --> 01:58:00,583
<i>and I do miss him.</i>

1523
01:58:02,541 --> 01:58:04,166
<i>He didn't deserve his fate.</i>

1524
01:58:06,708 --> 01:58:09,958
<i>Ah, I should have cut the Mongoose's neck.</i>

1525
01:58:15,500 --> 01:58:18,125
<i>I'll never know
what happened to my family.</i>

1526
01:58:20,750 --> 01:58:21,916
<i>I could only wonder.</i>

1527
01:58:26,875 --> 01:58:30,416
<i>But for the poor,
there are only two ways to get to the top,</i>

1528
01:58:30,500 --> 01:58:32,625
<i>crime or politics.</i>

1529
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:35,916
<i>Is it like that in your country too?</i>

1530
01:58:40,541 --> 01:58:42,458
Do you think about your mom and dad?

1531
01:58:44,916 --> 01:58:47,041
Give me another glass of milk,
won't you, uncle?

1532
01:58:47,125 --> 01:58:48,416
And a bowl of ice cream too.

1533
01:58:48,500 --> 01:58:49,916
You know ice cream is for Sundays.

1534
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:53,166
No. It's for today.

1535
01:58:55,166 --> 01:58:56,291
<i>Smart boy.</i>

1536
01:59:12,333 --> 01:59:13,625
- It's this car?
- Sir.

1537
01:59:16,958 --> 01:59:19,500
Your Excellency,
it's me from our email, sir.

1538
01:59:19,583 --> 01:59:21,333
The White Tiger, Ashok Sharma.
How are you?

1539
01:59:21,416 --> 01:59:24,000
We great entrepreneurs always have
our sights set on tomorrow.

1540
01:59:24,083 --> 01:59:25,416
Real estate.

1541
01:59:25,916 --> 01:59:28,208
With all the American companies
coming to Bangalore,

1542
01:59:28,291 --> 01:59:29,851
the white people need a place to sleep.

1543
01:59:29,875 --> 01:59:31,333
Thank you, sir.

1544
01:59:31,416 --> 01:59:32,291
Enjoy India, sir.

1545
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:39,833
White people
are on their way out, you know.

1546
01:59:40,583 --> 01:59:42,416
They'll be finished within our lifetime.

1547
01:59:44,041 --> 01:59:46,166
It's the century
of the brown man and the yellow man,

1548
01:59:46,250 --> 01:59:48,166
and God save everybody else.

1549
01:59:53,458 --> 01:59:56,750
<i>And sometimes I think,
even if they did catch me,</i>

1550
01:59:56,833 --> 01:59:59,000
<i>I'll never say I made a mistake.</i>

1551
01:59:59,083 --> 02:00:01,041
<i>It was all worthwhile to know,</i>

1552
02:00:01,125 --> 02:00:05,000
<i>just for a day,
just for an hour, just for a minute,</i>

1553
02:00:06,333 --> 02:00:09,375
<i>what it means not to be a servant.</i>

1554
02:00:18,333 --> 02:00:22,458
Now, what happens
in a typical Hindi film about murder?

1555
02:00:22,541 --> 02:00:25,333
A poor man kills a rich man,
and then gets nightmares

1556
02:00:25,416 --> 02:00:29,250
about the dead man pursuing him,
screaming, "Murderer! Shame!"

1557
02:00:30,083 --> 02:00:31,708
It doesn't happen like that.

1558
02:00:31,791 --> 02:00:35,041
The real nightmare is the other kind
where you feel like you didn't do it,

1559
02:00:35,125 --> 02:00:38,083
that you didn't kill your master,
that you lost your nerve,

1560
02:00:38,166 --> 02:00:41,375
and that you're still
a servant to another man.

1561
02:00:42,166 --> 02:00:43,291
But then you wake up…

1562
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,333
the sweating stops, your heartbeat slows.

1563
02:00:46,416 --> 02:00:48,041
The nightmare is over.

1564
02:00:48,875 --> 02:00:50,125
You did do it.

1565
02:00:50,208 --> 02:00:51,750
You killed your master.

1566
02:00:56,916 --> 02:00:58,375
I've switched sides.

1567
02:00:59,708 --> 02:01:02,000
I've made it. I've broken out of the coop.
