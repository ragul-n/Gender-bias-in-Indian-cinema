1
00:01:47,511 --> 00:01:48,637
New Delhi

2
00:01:57,388 --> 00:02:00,516
Simhachalam! Do you expect to
be made a Minister?

3
00:02:01,626 --> 00:02:03,423
He's not responding properly
to the query,

4
00:02:03,628 --> 00:02:04,686
let's ask Shivaji Shinde
the same question.

5
00:02:05,062 --> 00:02:07,087
What's your opinion about it, sir?

6
00:02:11,402 --> 00:02:16,169
Central Minister DK Mehta resigns
facing corruption charges,

7
00:02:16,374 --> 00:02:19,468
there's tough competition in
the party to take his place.

8
00:02:19,677 --> 00:02:23,169
Shivaji Shinde from Maharashtra and
Simhachalam from AP are frontrunners.

9
00:02:23,381 --> 00:02:26,680
Both leaders have reached the
party office with MP's supporting them.

10
00:02:27,051 --> 00:02:31,613
Everyone is eagerly waiting
who will win the race.

11
00:02:38,062 --> 00:02:39,461
Please come in, sir is calling you.

12
00:02:39,664 --> 00:02:41,632
Not you, you come in sir.

13
00:02:47,738 --> 00:02:49,069
Greetings sir.

14
00:02:49,373 --> 00:02:51,364
Forget about it and see this file.

15
00:02:52,443 --> 00:02:54,468
A file full of allegations against you.

16
00:02:54,679 --> 00:02:57,079
Your position is very weak.

17
00:02:57,314 --> 00:02:59,646
Do you want me to send
the report as it is?

18
00:03:00,184 --> 00:03:01,583
l'm your friend
so l'm telling you this.

19
00:03:01,952 --> 00:03:04,420
First clear yourself of
these allegations.

20
00:03:04,622 --> 00:03:09,025
lf not it'll not be you who'll take oath as
Minister on Telugu new year in Ashoka Hall,

21
00:03:09,226 --> 00:03:10,659
it'll be Simhachalam.

22
00:03:12,029 --> 00:03:16,693
l, Shivaji Shinde,
do swear in the name of God,

23
00:03:17,268 --> 00:03:23,935
that l will bear true faith and allegiance to
the Constitution of lndia as by law established,

24
00:03:24,341 --> 00:03:28,038
that l will faithfully execute
the office of Minister,

25
00:03:28,245 --> 00:03:29,678
that l will uphold the sovereignty
and integrity of lndia,

26
00:03:30,047 --> 00:03:36,145
that l will duly and faithfully and
to the best of my ability,

27
00:03:36,353 --> 00:03:44,727
and knowledge perform the duties of my office
without fear or favour, affection or ill-will.

28
00:03:49,366 --> 00:03:51,027
Why did you stare at me?
- Nothing sir.

29
00:03:51,235 --> 00:03:54,261
Would l become a Minister?
- You will become sir.

30
00:03:54,472 --> 00:03:58,101
You'll definitely become one.
Cent percent you'll be.

31
00:03:58,309 --> 00:03:59,241
No, you'll not!

32
00:04:03,981 --> 00:04:06,142
What did you say?
- You'll not become.

33
00:04:08,652 --> 00:04:13,589
You can become a Minister if you pin down
Simhachalam in some trumped up case,

34
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:17,189
and make him ineligible to become
a Minister constitutionally.

35
00:04:18,596 --> 00:04:23,431
You said what l was thinking.

36
00:04:23,634 --> 00:04:26,432
You all are bloody cronies.

37
00:04:26,637 --> 00:04:32,200
Disloyal cronies.
Get lost all of you !

38
00:04:32,409 --> 00:04:34,934
Go away from here.

39
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:50,450
l and Simhachalam are in the race
for 2 years to become a Minister,

40
00:04:52,463 --> 00:04:58,231
there's only one person who can
stop him from becoming a Minister,

41
00:04:58,669 --> 00:05:00,398
is in Hyderabad.

42
00:05:07,044 --> 00:05:11,504
Go there, chase...catch...

43
00:05:18,689 --> 00:05:21,419
lsn't there anyone to save me?

44
00:06:17,581 --> 00:06:19,515
Hey! Who are you?

45
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:23,449
Who are you man?- l want him.
- l too want him.

46
00:06:23,654 --> 00:06:26,589
He took Rs.10000 from me
promising to return in a month,

47
00:06:26,957 --> 00:06:29,425
l found him atlast after
two months, bloody cheat.

48
00:06:29,627 --> 00:06:32,994
Bloody crook took Rs.50000 loan
on 10% monthly interest.

49
00:06:33,197 --> 00:06:35,927
l staked money that lndia will lose
but bad luck they won.

50
00:06:36,133 --> 00:06:36,963
ls it my mistake?

51
00:06:37,167 --> 00:06:39,328
Bloody! How dare you bet
on lndia losing!

52
00:06:39,536 --> 00:06:40,468
l'll not spare you alive.

53
00:06:40,671 --> 00:06:44,402
Brother, forget about your loan.
l'll also forget, he's dead today.

54
00:06:44,608 --> 00:06:47,600
Think of Goddess Mysamma!

55
00:06:48,145 --> 00:06:49,737
Stop...stop...

56
00:06:51,181 --> 00:06:53,012
He's half dead!
Why did you ask me to stop?

57
00:06:53,217 --> 00:06:56,653
Brother, if he kills him no,
we'll lose our money.

58
00:06:56,987 --> 00:06:59,114
Yes.
- lf we return his loan?

59
00:06:59,323 --> 00:07:04,454
He'll leave him to us, we can
get back this loan also from him.

60
00:07:04,662 --> 00:07:09,292
l'll pay you Rs.10000,
please leave him to me.

61
00:07:10,134 --> 00:07:11,328
Take it.

62
00:07:14,271 --> 00:07:16,569
l don't need this dirty crap
after getting back my money.

63
00:07:16,941 --> 00:07:18,704
Not useful any more.
He's all yours.

64
00:07:19,076 --> 00:07:22,910
Brother, catch it...l may die...

65
00:07:23,113 --> 00:07:27,243
You've gone up!
- Bat man ! Bye bro!

66
00:07:27,551 --> 00:07:29,519
Why are you leaving me
at their mercy?

67
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,483
l got back my money,
l don't need you any more.

68
00:07:31,689 --> 00:07:34,419
Swear on Goddess Mysamma!

69
00:07:34,992 --> 00:07:37,517
What? Goddess Mysamma?

70
00:07:39,463 --> 00:07:41,658
You know l'm very sentimental
about Goddess Mysamma.

71
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,189
Brother...

72
00:07:46,003 --> 00:07:47,436
How's finance business
going on now, brother?

73
00:07:47,638 --> 00:07:48,627
Banks too get repaid in installments.

74
00:07:50,007 --> 00:07:53,067
He'll also repay in installments.
- Don't accept it, brother.

75
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:55,278
Catch me, l may fall down.

76
00:07:55,579 --> 00:07:56,603
Tell him to accept now.

77
00:07:56,981 --> 00:07:57,913
Tell him to accept, bloody!

78
00:07:58,115 --> 00:07:59,480
When two tigers are talking,
dogs mustn't bark!

79
00:07:59,683 --> 00:08:00,445
What's this nonsense?

80
00:08:00,651 --> 00:08:03,449
Yes, when he's suggesting something,
who are you to object it?

81
00:08:03,654 --> 00:08:05,178
Pay him Rs.10000 as the
first installment.

82
00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:07,152
What do l've to pay him?

83
00:08:07,324 --> 00:08:10,054
How dare you lift shirt infront of him!
Fall at his legs!

84
00:08:10,661 --> 00:08:12,026
Fall at my legs!
- Me?

85
00:08:12,229 --> 00:08:15,392
l told you to hold his legs.
- ls it for me? Shall l do it again?

86
00:08:15,933 --> 00:08:18,163
lt's become daily settlement.

87
00:08:18,602 --> 00:08:19,398
Bye!

88
00:08:19,636 --> 00:08:20,500
Pay him.

89
00:08:22,239 --> 00:08:23,433
Happy, brother?
- Yes.

90
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,234
You're very lucky.
Now, you clear out!

91
00:08:28,579 --> 00:08:31,639
Brother! What happened to
Rs.10000 in your pocket?- This is it.

92
00:08:32,016 --> 00:08:33,677
What about Rs.10000 paid by Bujji?
- This is it.

93
00:08:34,051 --> 00:08:36,019
What happened to your Rs.10000?
- This is it.

94
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:39,712
Brother, he returned our money
to us and fooled us.

95
00:08:43,193 --> 00:08:45,457
You staked and l got kicked.

96
00:08:45,662 --> 00:08:48,153
That's why l saved your ass.
Can't you take stick for me?

97
00:08:48,365 --> 00:08:50,356
Then, buy me a beer.

98
00:08:51,068 --> 00:08:52,296
Will they open beer bottles
like this too?

99
00:08:52,503 --> 00:08:53,731
Catch them!

100
00:09:01,378 --> 00:09:02,743
Hey you stop!

101
00:09:03,714 --> 00:09:05,579
l'll not spare you !

102
00:09:14,258 --> 00:09:17,318
Why are you knocking the door?
Bloody useless guys!

103
00:09:17,528 --> 00:09:19,621
A tinge of turmeric can
brighten the face...

104
00:09:19,997 --> 00:09:20,964
A chaste woman with dot...

105
00:09:21,165 --> 00:09:24,293
Oh God! These goons are
molesting me, save me!

106
00:09:25,169 --> 00:09:27,637
Kick them so that they
become impotent.

107
00:10:06,176 --> 00:10:09,202
Boy's urine will purify you, idiots!

108
00:10:19,323 --> 00:10:21,450
Stop...stop...

109
00:10:55,726 --> 00:10:57,626
What happened to you guys?

110
00:10:57,995 --> 00:11:01,431
Brother, he spilled chilly into our
boys' eyes and escaped.

111
00:11:01,632 --> 00:11:03,600
Come, let's catch him riding the bike.
- Come...come...- Hop on it.

112
00:11:07,504 --> 00:11:11,270
Hey sit properly!- Take right.
- Where?-Take left, brother.

113
00:11:13,177 --> 00:11:15,111
Where is he?

114
00:11:15,312 --> 00:11:16,609
Right...here...

115
00:11:17,414 --> 00:11:20,178
You say right or left,
but this is dead end.

116
00:11:20,384 --> 00:11:22,443
Get down from bike and turn,
you'll see him.

117
00:11:23,453 --> 00:11:28,288
Boys! Come, l got him!
Oh ! l'm afraid of knife.

118
00:11:28,492 --> 00:11:30,619
Keep this.
l'll pay you really this time.

119
00:11:31,061 --> 00:11:32,358
This is your first installment.

120
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:34,998
No...no...let's run away, buddy!

121
00:11:35,199 --> 00:11:36,996
Stop...stop...stop boys.
- Not him beat this man.

122
00:11:37,534 --> 00:11:40,435
This kid is good boy,
he paid the first installment.

123
00:11:40,637 --> 00:11:44,767
You can go kid.
Move boys, give him way.

124
00:11:45,542 --> 00:11:47,032
One, two, three...

125
00:11:47,244 --> 00:11:49,075
What happened to Rs.10000
he gave little while ago?

126
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:50,473
lt's in my pocket.

127
00:11:51,181 --> 00:11:52,079
What happened to my money?

128
00:11:52,282 --> 00:11:54,307
He picked your pocket
and then paid it to you.

129
00:11:54,518 --> 00:11:57,715
Oh no!
- What no? He took your bike too.

130
00:12:08,432 --> 00:12:09,490
May he die a miserable death !

131
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,065
May his home get burnt to ashes!

132
00:12:11,268 --> 00:12:12,394
May a hole develop in his heart!

133
00:12:12,603 --> 00:12:16,164
Who hit your bike? May that idiot get
crushed under my Nellore trash lorry...

134
00:12:16,373 --> 00:12:18,136
Who is he?
- l didn't get hurt severely.

135
00:12:18,342 --> 00:12:20,276
Who's worried about you, man?

136
00:12:20,477 --> 00:12:22,741
l'm shouting for the broken TV
gifted by my parents.

137
00:12:24,214 --> 00:12:28,708
He's not telling you but he's hurt
severely in secret places, sister.

138
00:12:29,086 --> 00:12:32,681
Do you call it hurt here?
ln my Nellore they say it as bruises.

139
00:12:33,056 --> 00:12:35,684
ls it? What do they call these
in your Nellore?

140
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:38,220
ldiot holding apples.

141
00:12:38,595 --> 00:12:40,290
You're very affectionate on me, sister.

142
00:12:40,497 --> 00:12:42,761
What? Sister?
Don't call me like that.

143
00:12:43,267 --> 00:12:45,531
Sister-in-law, what had actually...

144
00:12:45,736 --> 00:12:56,613
Brother...

145
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,241
Hey! What's this number language?

146
00:13:02,452 --> 00:13:04,545
lt was 'Ka' language when l came
here marrying you,

147
00:13:04,755 --> 00:13:06,279
when l started to understand it,
it was 'Ja' language,

148
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:07,616
now it's numbers language.

149
00:13:07,991 --> 00:13:09,720
l must know what were
you talking now.

150
00:13:10,093 --> 00:13:11,583
l understood it.

151
00:13:12,462 --> 00:13:14,930
But l'll not tell you.
- Won't you tell me?

152
00:13:18,669 --> 00:13:21,137
Sister, nothing great about number language,
it's very simple,

153
00:13:21,338 --> 00:13:22,669
how many alphabets?
- 26!

154
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,271
That's it, A means 1, B means 2,
C means...?- 3!

155
00:13:26,476 --> 00:13:29,309
You got it right!
What Bujji said was?

156
00:13:31,315 --> 00:13:32,111
Wait...

157
00:13:34,418 --> 00:13:38,286
lt means...He says he was responsible
for the accident.

158
00:13:39,423 --> 00:13:41,288
Brother-in-law's reply for it was...

159
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:48,958
Don't tell, she's big mouth !

160
00:13:49,466 --> 00:13:52,196
Don't you want us to live happily?

161
00:13:52,402 --> 00:13:55,303
After ten years of marriage
we are expecting a child,

162
00:13:55,505 --> 00:13:57,063
what if anything had
happened to him?

163
00:13:57,274 --> 00:13:59,037
My child would've become
a fatherless kid.

164
00:13:59,242 --> 00:14:02,143
Leave him, he didn't do it wantonly.
By mistake.

165
00:14:02,346 --> 00:14:04,576
lt wasn't your mistake
but your parents'.

166
00:14:04,948 --> 00:14:07,678
They gave birth and
thrust him on my shoulders.

167
00:14:10,387 --> 00:14:13,618
Has no work or earnings
but very sensitive.

168
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:15,548
ldiot! lt's yesterday's leftover.

169
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:18,057
Curd vada will taste better
as it gets old, sister.

170
00:14:18,261 --> 00:14:24,257
A cat smelled it and threw up, l thought of
throwing it out, but kept it for you.

171
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:31,232
Hey you....stop...
l'm talking to you.

172
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:33,673
Feeling bad?

173
00:14:34,044 --> 00:14:36,069
ls it for betraying you
or sister-in-law chiding you?

174
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:39,112
l don't even have money
to buy a beer.

175
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:43,444
l thought l was the poorest man in town.
You snatched it from me.

176
00:14:44,988 --> 00:14:46,319
But from tomorrow we'll differ
in many ways.

177
00:14:46,523 --> 00:14:49,253
What is it?
- l'll work and you'll beg.

178
00:14:49,459 --> 00:14:50,721
Work? Where?

179
00:14:51,094 --> 00:14:53,392
Brother always asks me to attend
interview, l'll make a try.

180
00:14:53,597 --> 00:14:55,428
Your qualification can't get you a job.

181
00:14:55,632 --> 00:14:57,998
You need this, not qualification
to get a job.

182
00:14:58,201 --> 00:14:59,225
Hair?

183
00:14:59,936 --> 00:15:00,925

Take the address,
l'll give you their family photo too.

188
00:15:30,567 --> 00:15:33,730
That's your name, right?

189
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:35,437
l'm fondly called as Krish.

190
00:15:37,007 --> 00:15:39,635
Will you please lift your head?
Humbleness is overflowing.

192
00:15:41,711 --> 00:15:44,305
Are you Vinay's younger brother?

193
00:15:44,514 --> 00:15:46,038
What's your qualification?

194
00:15:46,249 --> 00:15:49,741
ln degree...one subject...
- Failed? No problem.

195
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,451
l passed only one subject.

196
00:15:51,655 --> 00:15:53,282
All others are arrears.

197
00:15:53,623 --> 00:15:58,253
Do one thing, meet me in 2050.
Go...go...

198
00:15:58,962 --> 00:16:01,157
Okay sir...bye sir...

199
00:16:04,301 --> 00:16:07,566
Stop...stop...

200
00:16:09,239 --> 00:16:10,570
What happened to your hand?

201
00:16:11,074 --> 00:16:12,564
lt's in Nizamabad.
- Nizamabad?

202
00:16:12,943 --> 00:16:14,706
What is it doing there?
Giving charity?

203
00:16:17,514 --> 00:16:19,243
Say it in one line.

204
00:16:19,449 --> 00:16:23,351
A busy street, a mother and child
are crossing the road,

205
00:16:23,553 --> 00:16:24,485
l'm also crossing,

206
00:16:24,688 --> 00:16:28,385
just then a speeding lorry...
- Did it hit them?

207
00:16:28,592 --> 00:16:29,650
Would l allow it to hit them?

208
00:16:30,126 --> 00:16:32,390
l saved both mother and child.
- Next...?

209
00:16:32,596 --> 00:16:35,258
After that when l got up and saw,
my hand was lying little away.

210
00:16:35,465 --> 00:16:37,456
Doctors in hospital said
hand can't be fixed,

211
00:16:37,667 --> 00:16:38,725
do you know what the child's
mother said?

212
00:16:39,102 --> 00:16:41,593
How would l know?
- Listen to me.

213
00:16:42,072 --> 00:16:44,302
She said your hand saved our lives,

offer prayers daily with flowers & fruits.

215
00:16:49,613 --> 00:16:51,308
Did you give it to her?

216
00:16:51,515 --> 00:16:53,107
She took it away to Nizamabad.

217
00:16:55,352 --> 00:16:57,877
You brought tears with one line story,

218
00:16:58,588 --> 00:17:00,579

l'd be in lCU by now.

219
00:17:00,957 --> 00:17:02,288
Bye sir.

physically challenged quota.

00:17:08,098 --> 00:17:09,429
Giving job? Really sir?

How come my hand is here

227
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:44,596
That should be my question, right?
Do you consider me an idiot?

228
00:17:44,968 --> 00:17:47,596
You do right?

Taking so much time to

Pencil has become small
after many sharpening.

236

l got the pencil, sir.

237
00:18:06,556 --> 00:18:08,217
Got the pencil, you can go now.

238
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:12,654
l can judge the salary you'll offer
seeing the size of your pencil.

239
00:18:14,631 --> 00:18:16,565
Why are you staring?

240
00:18:16,933 --> 00:18:19,367
They come seeking jobs
without certificates.

241
00:18:19,569 --> 00:18:22,231
Sir, your pencil...
- Stop irritating me.

242

255
00:19:04,014 --> 00:19:08,314
Stop dancing here, your sister-in-law
would be angry at home.

256
00:19:08,518 --> 00:19:09,314
lt's all over.

257
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:11,487
Do you know the next scene?

Come sir, have you finished

What would you like to have?
Fruit juice or cool drink?

260
00:19:18,028 --> 00:19:21,054
Do you know in my Nellore
what they call guys like you? Bulls!

261
00:19:21,264 --> 00:19:23,630
Stop it, you're scaring me with ad.

263
00:19:26,369 --> 00:19:29,304
Mother! l'm hungry...

Ladies on either side of the seat.

00:19:39,249 --> 00:19:41,410
You want me to sell tickets
in black market.

268
00:19:42,152 --> 00:19:44,086
Look, l must be going to America.

269
00:19:44,287 --> 00:19:48,314
Take a sip and look,
l'll look like Statue of Liberty.

270
00:19:48,758 --> 00:19:51,488
lf you don't give me an idea
to go to America...

271
00:19:52,328 --> 00:19:55,354
Then do like Subba Rao, you'll also
go to America immediately.

272
00:19:55,565 --> 00:19:56,293
What did he do?

273
00:19:56,499 --> 00:19:59,935
He trapped a girl working in Dubai.
- Where?

274
00:20:00,503 --> 00:20:01,435
Okay, carry on.

275
00:20:01,638 --> 00:20:05,096

So, you say l must trap an America bound girl

Life will be settled.

281
00:20:21,057 --> 00:20:22,456
When we can't take care of our wives,

282
00:20:22,659 --> 00:20:24,650
then find wives who can take of us.

283
00:20:25,028 --> 00:20:26,290
Find an auspicious time to start.

284
00:20:26,496 --> 00:20:29,761
No need of auspicious time for dirty work.

00:21:01,631 --> 00:21:05,397
Hare Rama Hare Krishna!
Tell me the address of the girl...

286

lf life turns dull,
you need to apple polish it...

296
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:45,327
You need to take the risk,
apple polishing isn't a sin...

297
00:22:45,535 --> 00:22:51,633
Whether the odds are even
or evens are odds...

00:25:25,628 --> 00:25:30,031
You've only two months to trap

Not short temper, it's short time.

312
00:25:32,301 --> 00:25:34,531
Whatsoever it may be.
Let's follow the girl earnestly.

313
00:25:38,007 --> 00:25:41,738
Come fast, if you miss this train,

Go tell her.- Okay...but what?

Will you go or not?

317
00:25:55,725 --> 00:25:59,252

Go.

319

Oh what Devadas drinks!

Anyway that brand is
not available now.

336
00:27:27,283 --> 00:27:29,274
Did you fall in love
with anyone before?

337
00:27:29,485 --> 00:27:32,579
Once l fell from a bike and
another time from a running bus.

338
00:27:32,955 --> 00:27:35,924
Now l've fallen meeting you in train.

339
00:27:37,126 --> 00:27:40,721
No, so many people use me.
Now also l'm on that purpose only.

340
00:27:41,097 --> 00:27:42,064
What do you say?

341
00:27:43,332 --> 00:27:47,098
Can l scratch you now?

342
00:27:50,773 --> 00:27:51,569
Look here!

343
00:27:52,208 --> 00:27:55,302
The boy l love must smoke cigarettes,

344
00:27:55,511 --> 00:27:57,172
but he must quit smoking for me,

345
00:27:57,380 --> 00:28:00,679
he must be drink,
but he must give it up for me,

346
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:02,574
he must've fallen in love
with a girl before,

347
00:28:02,952 --> 00:28:04,442
but must build a Taj Mahal for you.

348
00:28:04,654 --> 00:28:08,055
You must be mad and
we must get treated.

349
00:28:08,257 --> 00:28:09,121
Am l mad then?

350
00:28:09,325 --> 00:28:11,259
Yes, indications are loud and clear.

351
00:28:13,529 --> 00:28:17,898
You're very good girl.
l expected you'll slap me.

352
00:28:18,968 --> 00:28:21,368
You're extremely good girl.

353
00:28:21,571 --> 00:28:24,540
You used left hand, had you used right,
my face would've swollen.

354
00:28:25,441 --> 00:28:27,500
Fully satisfied, you may go now.

355
00:28:31,948 --> 00:28:34,416
How's the girl?
- She's good.

356
00:28:34,617 --> 00:28:37,586
But her concepts are very confusing.
lt'll not work out.

357
00:28:37,954 --> 00:28:40,718
You need to work on it to work it out.
Come, let's be on it.

358
00:28:49,398 --> 00:28:51,730
No uncle, l and Meenu
can't unite again in this life.

359
00:28:52,101 --> 00:28:53,568
The relationship is broken forever.

360
00:28:54,237 --> 00:28:56,671
Uncle, for God sake, don't try to
unite me and Meenu.

361
00:28:57,306 --> 00:28:59,433
lnfact l've lost faith in love.

362
00:29:00,309 --> 00:29:01,367
Enough uncle...

363
00:29:02,078 --> 00:29:03,739
Days spent with her is enough
for this life, uncle.

364
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:16,752
Meenu ! How many sacrifices
l'd made for you.

365
00:29:17,126 --> 00:29:19,617
l love cigarettes, you said no,
l quit smoking for you.

366
00:29:19,996 --> 00:29:21,657
l used to have few drinks
with friends occasionally,

367
00:29:22,031 --> 00:29:23,464
you said no to that too,
l quit drinking too.

368
00:29:24,333 --> 00:29:26,563
Why? Why did you do this to me?

369
00:29:27,303 --> 00:29:30,466
Hereafter we both are...

370
00:29:34,076 --> 00:29:36,476
Something must happen...
something must really happen to me.

371
00:29:40,049 --> 00:29:43,576
Give me a bottle of whisky and
a cigarette packet too.

372
00:29:47,256 --> 00:29:49,690
l've been watching you,
why are you after me?

373
00:29:50,059 --> 00:29:52,152
Are you planning to propose me?

374
00:29:53,129 --> 00:29:54,118
This...

375
00:29:54,697 --> 00:29:56,665
Please stop!

376
00:29:58,067 --> 00:30:01,298
Why did you start smoking
and drinking again?

377
00:30:01,604 --> 00:30:05,131
You said you'd stopped smoking
and drinking for Meenu?

378
00:30:05,341 --> 00:30:06,740
How do you know about Meenu?

379
00:30:07,109 --> 00:30:09,976
l heard you talking to
your uncle on phone.

380
00:30:10,179 --> 00:30:12,409
Yes, l did quit, but who are you
to ask me that?

381
00:30:12,615 --> 00:30:16,745
Are you my uncle's or aunt's daughter
to ask me to keep up the promise?

382
00:30:18,587 --> 00:30:20,282
Take me as your friend.

383
00:30:20,656 --> 00:30:21,418
Friend?

384
00:30:21,757 --> 00:30:25,488
Women are like this only, first they say
friendship and then dump later.

385
00:30:25,695 --> 00:30:28,562
You spoiled my mood
by talking about Meenu.

386
00:30:28,764 --> 00:30:29,731
Excuse me!

387
00:30:30,099 --> 00:30:33,432
l beg you, this isn't CM Rajashekar Reddy's
phone, wrong number cut the line.

388
00:30:33,636 --> 00:30:35,297
Please listen to me once.
Don't drink please.

389
00:30:47,516 --> 00:30:49,643
You missed death by a whisker.

390
00:30:50,019 --> 00:30:52,647
No use of this life, let it go.
- Why are you so dejected?

391
00:30:53,022 --> 00:30:57,152
You'll know if you love, l mean
you'll know if you love someone.

392
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:02,426
Bye.

393
00:31:06,635 --> 00:31:07,431
Come here.

394
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:08,729
Remove your hand.

395
00:31:09,572 --> 00:31:10,539
This hand.

396
00:31:11,107 --> 00:31:12,267
Both hands.

397
00:31:13,576 --> 00:31:15,737
lsn't it you who proposed
to me in the train?

398
00:31:18,214 --> 00:31:20,648
Any girl in the city must touch me,
that's my charm.

399
00:31:21,016 --> 00:31:23,348
You..!
- Not so many times, l hate it.

400
00:31:24,487 --> 00:31:25,283
Go!

401
00:31:25,755 --> 00:31:28,053
ls she expecting prince for her?

402
00:31:28,557 --> 00:31:31,082
Who wants your sorry?
l didn't get few things,

403
00:31:31,293 --> 00:31:33,761
you created an imaginary
uncle in library, he's not there,

404
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:35,563
then you opened the purse and
created another girl's character,

405
00:31:35,765 --> 00:31:37,460
she's not there.
- She's there!

406
00:31:43,072 --> 00:31:45,597
She's like an apple! Who is she?

407
00:31:45,808 --> 00:31:49,574
Not ordinary girl but my passport
to America with Manju.

408
00:31:49,779 --> 00:31:50,746
Where did you get this photo?

409
00:31:51,113 --> 00:31:53,638
l told you about MD throwing
a file on me in the interview,

410
00:31:54,016 --> 00:31:55,142
l got the photo from it.

411
00:31:55,718 --> 00:31:59,586
Though it threw it wrongly,
you caught it right and cashing it.

412
00:32:02,291 --> 00:32:04,088
lt's me Manju !

413
00:32:06,495 --> 00:32:11,432
Manju, who?- That's our ATM Manju.
- Afternoon....on road...lorry...

414
00:32:11,634 --> 00:32:14,262
Oh that Manju !
How did you get my number?

415
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:16,404
You dropped your
visiting card on road,

416
00:32:16,605 --> 00:32:18,368
a beggar picked it for me.

417
00:32:18,574 --> 00:32:21,407
Beggar?
- You,your Meenu, your love story...

418
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:25,706
Why did you broke up?
l can't sleep till l get to know it.

419
00:32:26,081 --> 00:32:31,314
You talked about Meenu again !
l can't sleep tonight!

420
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:34,284
Am l acting good?
- Over acting, cut it now.

421
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:38,116
Why did you cut it?
- Cut it now, connectivity will grow.

422
00:32:38,327 --> 00:32:40,454
What if it disconnects?
- Forget her.

423
00:32:47,503 --> 00:32:50,301
Tell me.- Who was he?
- A midnight beggar!

424
00:32:50,506 --> 00:32:52,371
Please tell me about Meenu.

425
00:32:53,142 --> 00:32:54,074
Anyway you broached up the topic.

426
00:32:54,276 --> 00:32:56,471
When? Where and...
- How...?

427
00:33:08,457 --> 00:33:10,516
l wasn't here, l was with Meenu.

428
00:33:10,726 --> 00:33:12,557
You didn't meet Meenu, right?

429
00:33:14,964 --> 00:33:18,024
Meenu !
- She's like Miss lndia.

430
00:33:18,234 --> 00:33:20,259
How did you both meet first?

431
00:33:21,604 --> 00:33:26,041
2004, l got a seat for higher studies
in Cambridge university,

432
00:33:26,242 --> 00:33:28,267
l went to ltaly.

433
00:33:28,477 --> 00:33:32,072
But Cambridge university
is in London...?

434
00:33:34,383 --> 00:33:36,476
Bridges aren't just built in London,
they are built in ltaly too.

435
00:33:36,685 --> 00:33:41,122
They opened a new branch there.
- Branch...?

436
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:43,453
lt's difficult,
l can't tell you anything.

437
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:44,487
Please tell me.

438
00:33:44,693 --> 00:33:46,126
How can l tell with zero
general knowledge people?

439
00:33:46,328 --> 00:33:49,126
Please tell me.

440
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:05,237
Look, that bridge witnessed
our first meeting.

441
00:34:06,382 --> 00:34:10,716
The upper cloth which stuck to me
was the second witness.

442
00:34:17,192 --> 00:34:20,593
Third witness for next meeting
was this man !

443
00:34:47,623 --> 00:34:49,989
How could she misunderstand you?

444
00:34:50,192 --> 00:34:53,457
First misunderstanding would
turn into understanding later.

445
00:34:53,662 --> 00:34:55,459
She said sorry, right?

446
00:34:56,231 --> 00:34:58,426
ls it my story or yours?
- Yours!

447
00:34:58,634 --> 00:35:00,067
Why do you rush to next scene?

448
00:35:01,036 --> 00:35:04,233
l've returned.- Where are you?
- With you. Come behind me.

449
00:35:05,441 --> 00:35:07,409
Here l'm!
- Follow me now.

450
00:35:33,636 --> 00:35:35,433
Oh my God! Why is she here again?

451
00:35:39,308 --> 00:35:40,104
Shut up!

452
00:35:45,981 --> 00:35:50,441
lt wasn't intentional that day...
- l'm here to say sorry.

453
00:35:51,053 --> 00:35:55,183
An lndian lady saw it and told me
it wasn't your mistake but mine.

454
00:35:55,391 --> 00:35:56,949
That's why l'm here to say sorry.

455
00:35:57,159 --> 00:36:00,253
l mean you're not here
to slap me again, right?- No.

456
00:36:04,366 --> 00:36:05,697
You said you'll say sorry.

457
00:36:13,275 --> 00:36:17,075
The girl saying sorry, l think it was
the starting point of your love, right?

458
00:36:17,279 --> 00:36:18,974
lt was just the melting point.

459
00:36:19,181 --> 00:36:21,581
Starting point was at airport
a little earlier.

460
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:24,418
When Cambridge university closed
for Sankranthi holidays...

461
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,518
Cambridge closes for Sankranthi too?

462
00:36:27,723 --> 00:36:29,554
They won't, we take it.

463
00:36:30,225 --> 00:36:32,352
You met her in the airport, right?

464
00:36:36,498 --> 00:36:40,594
You...?
- My bag...bag...

465
00:36:41,003 --> 00:36:43,130
What happened?
- He took away my bag.

466
00:36:43,338 --> 00:36:45,272
That guy...catch him.
- That long haired man?

467
00:37:19,942 --> 00:37:21,569
My passport, cash...

468
00:37:21,777 --> 00:37:22,641
ls everything safe?

469
00:37:28,283 --> 00:37:32,344
Hadn't you saved my passport, l would've
ended up serving here for the lifetime.

470
00:37:32,554 --> 00:37:35,421
l lied to him you're my girl friend,
he returned it.

471
00:37:36,458 --> 00:37:38,426
Looks like you're feeling bad
for saying girl friend.

472
00:37:39,294 --> 00:37:41,762
l'm feeling bad for saying it's a lie.

473
00:37:42,631 --> 00:37:44,428
l'll clean it.

474
00:37:48,804 --> 00:37:50,999
Next time l'll say you're my wife.

475
00:37:53,342 --> 00:37:55,367
lnto my dreams...into my heart...

476
00:37:55,577 --> 00:38:02,710
You've come as love mail...
my girl...my life...my fun...

477
00:38:28,677 --> 00:38:30,645
Dating me,
pulling me towards you...

478
00:38:30,846 --> 00:38:37,251
You've caught my love like cold...
my dear...

479
00:38:37,519 --> 00:38:41,478
May l become your shadow
and be with you always...

480
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:45,854
May l touch you gently when you
enchant me like sweet honey...

481
00:38:46,061 --> 00:38:51,658
Your beauty has left an everlasting
imprint on my heart...

482
00:38:52,501 --> 00:38:58,064
O girl, l've lost my sleep
because of you...

483
00:39:29,838 --> 00:39:33,797
An idea can change the life...

484
00:39:34,009 --> 00:39:38,309
lf l get you,
my life will turn into gold...

485
00:39:38,513 --> 00:39:42,574
You came like rain in summer...
and cooled me off...

486
00:39:42,784 --> 00:39:46,743
You came like a lightning in day
and brought light into my life...

487
00:39:46,955 --> 00:39:48,889
You're my heartbeat...

488
00:39:49,091 --> 00:39:51,116
You're my body and soul...

489
00:39:51,493 --> 00:39:53,586
You're my love...

490
00:39:53,795 --> 00:39:57,128
You're my everything...
you're my future...

491
00:40:45,013 --> 00:40:46,776
Scold or beat me, l'll take it...

492
00:40:46,982 --> 00:40:48,847
l love you so much...

493
00:40:49,051 --> 00:40:53,351
l'll hide you in my heart,
you're my Swiss bank...

494
00:40:53,555 --> 00:40:57,582
l was searching for you...
Lo behold, l found you...

495
00:40:57,793 --> 00:41:01,923
You drowned me funnily
in the sea of love...

496
00:41:02,297 --> 00:41:05,266
You're my treasure...
you're my bliss...

497
00:41:05,467 --> 00:41:10,769
You're the boon of my life...

498
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:15,367
l'll come flying to you...

499
00:41:15,577 --> 00:41:19,604
l'll be with you always,
you're my lifeline...

500
00:42:11,433 --> 00:42:12,695
But still l don't get one thing,

501
00:42:12,901 --> 00:42:15,335
when you both love so deeply,
why did you break up?

502
00:42:15,537 --> 00:42:18,028
Nothing great, l said let's go
to America and work there,

503
00:42:18,407 --> 00:42:21,535
and she wants to stay back
and work in lndia.

504
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:25,607
You tell me, where would anyone
prefer to work?- America!

505
00:42:25,814 --> 00:42:26,940
She's not as sensible as you.

506
00:42:27,315 --> 00:42:29,783
She was adamant about
working in lndia only.

507
00:42:29,985 --> 00:42:32,783
l too didn't give up, we broke up.

508
00:42:32,988 --> 00:42:38,085
Broke up?
- We'll cover the deficit.

509
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,954
We broke up!

510
00:42:47,669 --> 00:42:51,799
Till now l didn't share my feelings
with anyone, l got you by luck.

511
00:42:52,374 --> 00:42:55,605
Don't know why l felt like
coming close to you.

512
00:42:55,811 --> 00:42:56,800
So l told you.

513
00:42:59,714 --> 00:43:01,409
l feel greatly relieved today.

514
00:43:01,883 --> 00:43:02,941
Don't you've anyone?

515
00:43:03,318 --> 00:43:04,785
l do have a brother for namesake.

516
00:43:04,986 --> 00:43:06,851
He's a mad man with
an arrogant wife.

517
00:43:07,055 --> 00:43:09,922
He appears brave but a coward really.

518
00:43:10,292 --> 00:43:13,853
They say henpecked husband, that's him.

519
00:43:22,003 --> 00:43:23,436
What's the time now?

520
00:43:23,638 --> 00:43:27,039
You've a watch but
still asking him time?

521
00:43:27,409 --> 00:43:30,936
No, it's not working...
no, it's broken.

522
00:43:31,313 --> 00:43:38,048
l must know...l must know...
what's happening here?

523
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:39,944
Who is he?
- Someone like my mad brother.

524
00:43:40,322 --> 00:43:41,619
Let's go out and talk.

525
00:43:42,624 --> 00:43:43,613
Who is it?

526
00:43:43,925 --> 00:43:44,892
Come, let's go.

527
00:43:46,528 --> 00:43:48,621
Hey, you took away my bike...

528
00:43:48,964 --> 00:43:51,558
Why are you beating me?
- Stop...stop...

529
00:43:51,766 --> 00:43:52,790
He's ogling at my girl friend.

530
00:43:53,001 --> 00:43:56,869
How dare you ogle at me!
- Sister! l'm not a man like that.

531
00:43:57,072 --> 00:44:00,041
Manju, you come.
- Catch him boys!

532
00:44:01,309 --> 00:44:02,571
Come this side.

533
00:44:15,490 --> 00:44:17,583
Brother, please save us.

534
00:44:17,792 --> 00:44:20,955
We are lovers and
these goons are...

535
00:44:21,329 --> 00:44:22,353
Move boys!

536
00:44:22,564 --> 00:44:26,625
He's trying to separate us,
you must save us from them.

537
00:44:39,948 --> 00:44:41,939
What's this, bro?
Beating me in my own love story,

538
00:44:42,317 --> 00:44:43,045
he's the villain !

539
00:44:43,418 --> 00:44:44,783
Greetings brother!

540
00:44:45,387 --> 00:44:49,949
He's my man, getting him ready
for wrestling competition. Kill him!

541
00:44:50,325 --> 00:44:56,628
No brother...
please no brother...

542
00:45:06,741 --> 00:45:08,971
No chance of heroics,
let's run away.

543
00:46:01,396 --> 00:46:02,021
Come!

544
00:46:03,698 --> 00:46:04,562
Come!

545
00:46:37,632 --> 00:46:40,032
Hold this!
- l can't!

546
00:46:59,688 --> 00:47:01,952
What a shot!
- What did he shot?

547
00:47:02,324 --> 00:47:05,384
What did he shot?
Knocked out the knuckles!

548
00:47:07,362 --> 00:47:08,488
What happened?

549
00:47:10,031 --> 00:47:14,331
Over me...he's all over my heart!
l've decided.

550
00:47:14,536 --> 00:47:17,505
Tomorrow morning l'll express
my love to him.

551
00:47:21,376 --> 00:47:22,934
Manju loves me.

552
00:47:23,311 --> 00:47:24,869
She may express her love tomorrow also.

553
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:28,572
So, l don't need you anymore.

554
00:47:44,299 --> 00:47:45,766
Brother, come sit here.
- Get lost!

555
00:47:45,967 --> 00:47:47,059
You get lost man !

556
00:47:50,305 --> 00:47:53,399
l want to tell you something.
- Tell me.

557
00:48:27,308 --> 00:48:28,570
Tell me!

558
00:49:01,443 --> 00:49:02,933
Why is she here?

559
00:49:04,479 --> 00:49:06,606
May be here to compromise.

560
00:49:08,049 --> 00:49:09,949
Why did she sit next to you then?

561
00:49:15,423 --> 00:49:16,981
Talk to her once.

562
00:49:20,595 --> 00:49:23,689
lf you don't talk to her,
l'll talk her to compromise.

563
00:49:26,601 --> 00:49:27,795
Then, talk to her.

564
00:49:31,539 --> 00:49:32,801
Talk to her!

565
00:49:33,475 --> 00:49:40,643
Okay, let bygones be bygones,
if ours is true love...

566
00:49:41,783 --> 00:49:42,750
l mean if...

567
00:49:43,852 --> 00:49:46,650
Tell me...tell me something.

568
00:49:47,989 --> 00:49:50,685
l go sleepless at nights
and get daydreams.

569
00:49:50,892 --> 00:49:52,484
Presently l'm on the tip of a mount...

570
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:00,631
Reached the station !

571
00:50:03,972 --> 00:50:06,338
Did you see her leaving
without any care?

572
00:50:06,541 --> 00:50:09,874
She was always like that.
l madly loved her, l need this.

573
00:50:10,912 --> 00:50:13,073
She likes you that's why
she sat next to you.

574
00:50:13,448 --> 00:50:17,544
She wanted to talk to you personally,
that's why she left this file here.

575
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:19,714
What's this logic?
This is not correct.

576
00:50:19,921 --> 00:50:23,618
Logic is correct,
take the file and talk to her.

577
00:50:31,766 --> 00:50:35,930
No use, you won't find it.
Because you didn't bring it here.

578
00:50:36,137 --> 00:50:38,332
What happened to it then?
- Try to remember,

579
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:43,102
may have forgotten it in restaurant
or train or anywhere else.

580
00:50:43,878 --> 00:50:45,812
Why are you crying?

581
00:50:46,014 --> 00:50:49,882
No, if l get this job, l was planning
to get mother operated.

582
00:50:50,084 --> 00:50:51,813
Okay, don't get tensed.

583
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:56,013
Make request to MD, promise to
submit duplicates in a week.

584
00:50:57,992 --> 00:51:01,587
What's these original marks certificates?
Who is this girl?

585
00:51:01,796 --> 00:51:04,788
The girl sitting on my left.
- Why particularly on left?

586
00:51:04,999 --> 00:51:06,057
Because another girl was sitting on right.

587
00:51:06,434 --> 00:51:08,299
Why were you sitting between them?
- My bad time.

588
00:51:08,503 --> 00:51:09,561
lf your sister-in-law comes to know...

589
00:51:09,771 --> 00:51:13,537
What are you both doing in the room?

590
00:51:29,057 --> 00:51:30,581
What's this numbers language?

591
00:51:30,792 --> 00:51:31,816
Do you think l can't understand it?

592
00:51:32,026 --> 00:51:34,392
You said, don't tell sister-in-law,

593
00:51:34,596 --> 00:51:37,895
you said, if you tell her,
she'll bite you like a devil.

594
00:51:38,099 --> 00:51:40,590
What did l tell you?
- l'll break your legs.

595
00:51:40,802 --> 00:51:44,294
That's it! lf you bring any trouble,
l'll break your legs.

596
00:51:44,505 --> 00:51:48,441
No sensible man would offer job
without certificates, l'm sensible.

597
00:51:48,643 --> 00:51:50,372
l'll submit duplicates
within a week, sir.

598
00:51:50,578 --> 00:51:51,806
How many times do l've to...

599
00:51:52,013 --> 00:51:54,675
Can't you keep her application in
pending till she submits duplicates?

600
00:51:54,882 --> 00:51:56,873
Every becomes social worker
on seeing a girl.

601
00:51:57,085 --> 00:51:59,519
Give me one chance sir.
- Please go away.

602
00:51:59,721 --> 00:52:01,450
Already you're in the waiting list.

603
00:52:01,656 --> 00:52:03,783
Company rule is to offer the job
the next candidate if you've any problem.

604
00:52:03,992 --> 00:52:06,426
Please go away, don't disturb me.
Go...go away!

605
00:52:22,677 --> 00:52:24,372
Aren't you Meenakshi?

606
00:52:24,812 --> 00:52:26,439
Will you leave your file
wherever you feel like?

607
00:52:26,648 --> 00:52:28,809
l found it in train, l'm a good man
so l'm returning it.

608
00:52:29,017 --> 00:52:30,780
Check if everything is fine.

609
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:34,620
Everything is fine.

610
00:52:44,732 --> 00:52:47,633
Wait here!

611
00:52:58,780 --> 00:53:05,242
Look, l found my lost certificates.

612
00:53:08,289 --> 00:53:11,417
Give joining report to HR and
start working from tomorrow.

613
00:53:11,626 --> 00:53:12,957
l'm giving it, am l not?

614
00:53:17,699 --> 00:53:19,758
Excuse me...you...

615
00:53:22,537 --> 00:53:27,065
l'd be in deep trouble
if l hadn't got this job.

616
00:53:33,114 --> 00:53:34,809
lsn't it very thrilling?

617
00:53:35,016 --> 00:53:37,814
Neither l know you or you know me.

618
00:53:38,019 --> 00:53:41,455
Did you ever imagine we'll be
having coffee together like this?

619
00:53:41,656 --> 00:53:43,089
lt's all destiny!

620
00:53:49,430 --> 00:53:52,797
Why are you using straw
to drink a coffee?

621
00:54:07,048 --> 00:54:09,915
l can't believe it,
l can't take so many twists.

622
00:54:10,284 --> 00:54:12,752
What was our plan,
this is you,

623
00:54:13,054 --> 00:54:13,918
this is Manju,

624
00:54:14,288 --> 00:54:17,849
if you trap Manju, we expected
a safe journey to America with her,

625
00:54:18,059 --> 00:54:20,527
but now the girl in the photo
has caught you in real,

626
00:54:20,728 --> 00:54:22,389
your position is back
to square one.

627
00:54:22,964 --> 00:54:25,432
What happened to Manju?
What happened to your love?

628
00:54:25,633 --> 00:54:26,600
What happened to your
American dreams?

629
00:54:26,801 --> 00:54:29,361
What will happen to him?
- Who is he?- Me!

630
00:54:29,570 --> 00:54:31,731
l thought of coming to
America following you.

631
00:54:31,939 --> 00:54:37,036
Now l've to sell savories on street.

632
00:54:37,411 --> 00:54:39,936
Nothing is in our hands,
it's all in destiny's hands.

633
00:54:40,314 --> 00:54:43,875
Are you head of Kanchi Mutt?
Talking about destiny?

634
00:54:44,085 --> 00:54:46,451
We buy ticket and board a train,

635
00:54:46,654 --> 00:54:49,020
we think of getting down in a station but
destiny takes us to another station.

636
00:54:49,390 --> 00:54:50,914
Train philosophy?

637
00:54:51,125 --> 00:54:54,288
Do one thing, buy a ticket to
Madhapur and board the train,

638
00:54:54,495 --> 00:54:56,986
Let's see what will make you
get down in another station.

639
00:55:02,036 --> 00:55:03,401
Did you see?

640
00:55:03,771 --> 00:55:05,329
He's alone.

641
00:55:06,274 --> 00:55:08,834
May be compromise failed,
go talk to him.

642
00:55:10,077 --> 00:55:13,046
lf seat is vacant, occupy it.
Go!

643

Go l say!
- You want me to go?

00:55:16,450 --> 00:55:17,849
Go l say!

645
00:55:26,928 --> 00:55:28,361
You...here...?

646
00:55:29,397 --> 00:55:32,059
l was sitting there but l saw you.
- There?- Yes.

647
00:55:32,967 --> 00:55:35,435
Do you always travel in this route?

648
00:55:37,405 --> 00:55:39,703
ls your office in this route?

649
00:55:41,475 --> 00:55:43,705
Where do you work?

650
00:55:47,615 --> 00:55:48,809
Lux?

651
00:55:50,918 --> 00:55:51,680
MD?

652
00:55:51,886 --> 00:55:53,547
Little down.

653
00:55:54,622 --> 00:55:55,452
Little higher.

654
00:55:56,324 --> 00:55:58,554
What are they talking about?

655
00:55:58,759 --> 00:56:00,556
Where did you finish your graduation?

656
00:56:05,266 --> 00:56:07,564
Some people think it's in ltaly.

657
00:56:08,336 --> 00:56:09,803
Who would've cracked the joke?

658
00:56:10,004 --> 00:56:11,494
l'll break your teeth, shut up!

659
00:56:11,706 --> 00:56:14,300
Why are you feeling now?
You gave him the file.

660
00:56:14,508 --> 00:56:16,738
You tried to unite them.

661
00:56:18,312 --> 00:56:19,939
That was my mistake.

662
00:56:22,550 --> 00:56:24,950
Reached my station, you...?

663
00:56:25,319 --> 00:56:26,843
Mine is next station.

664
00:56:39,333 --> 00:56:42,769
Look, how he's following her
like Hutch dog.

665
00:56:50,711 --> 00:56:51,939
What's your name?

666

Husband's name?
- Husband?

667
00:56:54,582 --> 00:56:57,642
The man standing shy
holding your upper cloth.

668
00:57:00,655 --> 00:57:02,885
Your dress got stuck in my bracelet.

669
00:57:08,029 --> 00:57:10,623
You're too much.
- l'm very shy type.

670
00:57:11,866 --> 00:57:12,833

671
00:57:13,534 --> 00:57:15,434
Last night Lord of snakes

00:57:15,636 --> 00:57:16,898

snake pit 101 times.

00:57:19,607 --> 00:57:22,303
Lord of snakes from your
native Nellore.

675
00:57:22,510 --> 00:57:23,977
From my Nellore?

676
00:57:24,345 --> 00:57:26,404
Lord of snakes from Municipal office?

677
00:57:26,614 --> 00:57:29,913
Who else then you think?
- Not just 101 times, l'll do 1001 times.

678
00:57:30,284 --> 00:57:32,514
You both make a great couple.

679
00:57:36,390 --> 00:57:39,382
Sorry, priest said without
knowing about us.

680
00:57:39,593 --> 00:57:42,687
He should've said when you both
had come instead of we both.

681
00:57:42,897 --> 00:57:45,923
We two?
- l mean you and your girl friend.

682
00:57:46,334 --> 00:57:48,063
Oh Manju !

683
00:57:48,436 --> 00:57:52,600
She hates visiting temples.
She's not traditional like you.

684
00:57:52,807 --> 00:57:54,035
She's little mad.

685
00:57:54,408 --> 00:57:57,707
l don't know if l can ask or not,
answer me if you want to,

686
00:57:57,912 --> 00:57:59,709
or else refuse.
- No problem, ask me.

687
00:58:01,248 --> 00:58:04,945
You'd a problem with your
girl friend in the train...

688
00:58:05,319 --> 00:58:06,809
Not problem, but irritation.

689
00:58:07,021 --> 00:58:09,956
l say let's watch a Telugu film,
she says English film.

690
00:58:10,324 --> 00:58:12,315
l say let's go to
a temple early morning,

691
00:58:12,526 --> 00:58:13,857
she says let's go to
a pub at late night.

692
00:58:14,061 --> 00:58:17,497
These are silly problems,
you can adjust easily.

693
00:58:17,698 --> 00:58:19,325
The problem started with America.

694
00:58:19,533 --> 00:58:20,932
She wants to go to America
and l want to stay in lndia,

695
00:58:21,302 --> 00:58:23,862
why should we go to America
after studying in lndia?

696
00:58:25,740 --> 00:58:28,573
Sorry, l used her language
along with her body language.

697
00:58:28,776 --> 00:58:30,334
Tell me, which is better,
lndia or America?

698
00:58:31,712 --> 00:58:33,907
Even in my sleep,
l'll say lndia is best.

699
00:58:34,281 --> 00:58:36,909
Look, how our ideas are same.

700
00:58:37,585 --> 00:58:39,746
l'm feeling for missing this link.

701
00:58:41,822 --> 00:58:43,983
Why did you come into my life so late?

702
00:58:45,493 --> 00:58:49,759
Had l found someone as supportive as you,
my life wouldn't be like this?

703
00:58:52,433 --> 00:58:57,063
Lord Krishna mesmerized the hearts of
Gopikas like that and won their hearts.

704
00:58:59,407 --> 00:59:00,704
What a matching!

705
00:59:00,908 --> 00:59:02,876
What about your parents?

706
00:59:03,544 --> 00:59:05,034
l don't have parents.

707
00:59:05,579 --> 00:59:08,673
To share my grief their parents
too are no more.

708
00:59:08,883 --> 00:59:09,941
Don't you've anyone?

709
00:59:10,317 --> 00:59:12,842
l do have a useless brother.

710
00:59:13,054 --> 00:59:15,614
Like a torn currency note,
like a disputed plot,

711
00:59:15,823 --> 00:59:16,949
like a batsman out on duck.

712
00:59:17,324 --> 00:59:20,054
Sir!
- No change.

713
00:59:20,394 --> 00:59:21,019
Go now!

714
00:59:21,395 --> 00:59:22,555
My dear!

715
00:59:26,934 --> 00:59:30,301
l think you were in penance,
did l disturb you?

716
00:59:30,504 --> 00:59:31,562
What's the time now?

717
00:59:32,339 --> 00:59:34,068
What's your problem?

718
00:59:34,608 --> 00:59:38,977
Priest, his watch is not working,
please tell him the time.

719
00:59:43,384 --> 00:59:45,875
Silly idiot! How dare you ask
time in temple!

720
00:59:46,087 --> 00:59:47,987
You must ask only boons.

721
00:59:48,522 --> 00:59:51,548
Stop...stop...what had actually
happened was...

722
00:59:51,759 --> 00:59:53,351
He loves a girl...
- How dare you call me informally!

723
00:59:53,561 --> 00:59:55,119
Taking anger on me
instead of the priest.

724
00:59:56,464 --> 00:59:59,297
Meenu, get an auto,
l'll give him a coating.

725
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:03,266
Give him a good thrashing.
- Go.

726
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:07,634
Brother! Please forgive me.

727
01:00:07,842 --> 01:00:11,278
Let's discuss next episode
of Lord Krishna's ploys tomorrow.

728
01:00:12,313 --> 01:00:14,781
l didn't get any benefit of going
to temple with you yesterday.

729
01:00:14,982 --> 01:00:16,540
Got bad news only.

730
01:00:16,984 --> 01:00:19,782
She bought a ticket to America.
She's leaving.

731
01:00:20,387 --> 01:00:22,446
Love is not blind but selfish.

732
01:00:22,690 --> 01:00:24,783
Will she leave me for a better man?

733
01:00:25,326 --> 01:00:26,520
Why are you feeling sad?

734
01:00:26,727 --> 01:00:29,924
lnfact the girl must feel
sad for losing you.

735
01:00:31,031 --> 01:00:33,727
What?
- Looks like its raining.

736
01:00:40,708 --> 01:00:42,972
You caught one drop,
what if it rains heavily?

737
01:00:43,344 --> 01:00:44,470
But still l'll not let you get wet.

738
01:00:44,678 --> 01:00:46,111
l've a special umbrella.

739
01:00:48,449 --> 01:00:49,473
Come closer.

740
01:00:50,351 --> 01:00:51,648
Count to 3.

741
01:01:27,021 --> 01:01:36,020
My heart is rushing like
flowing river Godavari...

742
01:01:36,397 --> 01:01:40,663
Like clouds in the sky...

743
01:01:40,868 --> 01:01:44,964
My boat is floating away...

744
01:01:45,339 --> 01:01:47,603
l'm not what l was...

745
01:01:47,808 --> 01:01:54,304
l'm different now...
ls it true?

746
01:02:54,508 --> 01:02:56,635
Brother-in-law! Please come in
for a minute.

747
01:02:56,844 --> 01:02:58,402
l'm finished if l get caught
with these monkeys.

748
01:02:59,747 --> 01:03:01,908
ls he your friend?

749
01:03:04,551 --> 01:03:05,347
l expected this.

750
01:03:05,552 --> 01:03:10,854
l saw a miracle...

751
01:03:12,326 --> 01:03:17,025
Someone has taken
away my heart...

752
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:23,464
You've come out from
my imaginations...

753
01:03:23,671 --> 01:03:28,040
You trapped me in your love and
drowned me in your thoughts...

754
01:03:28,409 --> 01:03:33,938
l've become void...

755
01:04:57,431 --> 01:05:02,562
Love flowed from you...

756
01:05:04,371 --> 01:05:09,502
lt raced my heart beat...

757
01:05:11,011 --> 01:05:15,505
What spell of love youive cast on me?

758
01:05:15,716 --> 01:05:19,982
l'm following
wherever you go...

759
01:05:20,354 --> 01:05:24,757
l've become your lovely slave...

760
01:05:49,583 --> 01:05:52,552
What are you discussing
over smoking cigarette?

761
01:05:52,753 --> 01:05:54,015
Why are the machines still here?

762
01:05:54,388 --> 01:05:55,446
Waiting for the phone call, brother.

763
01:05:55,656 --> 01:05:57,886
Can't you make a call yourself?
- l don't have the number.

764
01:05:58,258 --> 01:06:00,886
Your brains go dead in
my brother-in-law's absence.

765
01:06:04,898 --> 01:06:07,389
Hey! Give me a special betel leaf!

766
01:06:07,601 --> 01:06:09,899
You destroyed my shop
for a betel leaf.

767
01:06:10,270 --> 01:06:15,298
Bloody! How long have you been here?

768
01:06:15,509 --> 01:06:17,909
You're going overboard.
- With sir's grace for 10 years.

769
01:06:18,278 --> 01:06:19,939
Stop! What's the trouble?

770
01:06:20,314 --> 01:06:23,772
Look sir, he broke my bottles.
- Okay, give him betel leaf as he asked.

771
01:06:23,984 --> 01:06:25,576
Take it sir.

772
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:29,052
Brother! One minute!

773
01:06:32,025 --> 01:06:33,652
Have you seen them anywhere?

774
01:06:36,463 --> 01:06:36,827
Why do you want them?

775
01:06:37,030 --> 01:06:38,588
They are on a run after
committing a murder.

776
01:06:38,866 --> 01:06:40,766
Murder? Where?

777
01:06:41,001 --> 01:06:43,663
Just tell me, if you know them or not.

778
01:06:43,871 --> 01:06:47,864
Why are you getting angry?
l've their address too.

779
01:06:54,915 --> 01:06:58,476
Get lost you bloody crooks!
- Start the vehicle!

780
01:07:02,656 --> 01:07:03,623
Who are they?

781
01:07:03,824 --> 01:07:05,883
l must meet brother-in-law immediately,
get the vehicle.

782
01:07:06,426 --> 01:07:07,552
Kurnool 52 kms.

783
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:23,874
They didn't know l'm your man
and showed me the photo.

784
01:07:24,011 --> 01:07:25,740
l doubted their intention
and fired at them.

785
01:07:26,547 --> 01:07:30,950
People in that photo are
the witness for my sins.

786
01:07:31,318 --> 01:07:36,585
Shinde is planning to unearth the truth
and deny me a cabinet berth.

787
01:07:37,291 --> 01:07:42,695
l expected Shinde to stop me
but didn't expect he'll come this way.

788
01:07:43,330 --> 01:07:46,595
People in that photo mustnit
get into Shinde's hands,

789
01:07:47,668 --> 01:07:48,862
we must find them first.

790
01:08:00,714 --> 01:08:06,584
Some are good, some act as good.

791
01:08:07,421 --> 01:08:11,221
Sorry l downloaded your photo
without permission,

792
01:08:11,425 --> 01:08:13,985
l want to show it to my parents.

793
01:08:14,461 --> 01:08:18,898
l like you, l want to marry you.

794
01:08:20,067 --> 01:08:23,628
lf you too like.
- l don't want to marry now.

795
01:08:24,404 --> 01:08:26,736
l can wait any long for you.

796
01:08:29,309 --> 01:08:33,040
l know, women never like gentlemen,

797
01:08:33,914 --> 01:08:36,849
you're refusing me
because of someone else.

798
01:08:37,017 --> 01:08:39,042
But he's a cheat.

799
01:08:39,553 --> 01:08:42,784
He has already ditched a girl.
Now he's after you.

800
01:08:42,990 --> 01:08:44,924
Who are you talking about?

801
01:08:49,730 --> 01:08:51,789
What do you know about him?

802
01:08:52,799 --> 01:08:53,766
Okay?

803
01:09:10,984 --> 01:09:14,920
ls he from Cambridge?
Bloody localite!

804
01:09:15,422 --> 01:09:18,949
A compulsive liar!

805
01:09:20,460 --> 01:09:24,055
He has many tricks under his sleeves.
Stay away from him.

806
01:09:24,431 --> 01:09:27,594
Else he'll drown you in river Musi.

807
01:09:30,671 --> 01:09:37,975
O my love, come...

808
01:09:38,345 --> 01:09:51,657
l'm burning with desire,
come and douse it...

809
01:09:53,894 --> 01:09:59,662
Hug me so that the fire of
passion in me cools down...

810
01:09:59,866 --> 01:10:00,855
Sit here.

811
01:10:02,602 --> 01:10:06,470
Why are you so happy today?
What's the matter?

812
01:10:06,673 --> 01:10:08,265
l'm going to tell Manju
about my proposal.

813
01:10:08,475 --> 01:10:10,943
Are you going to propose Manju?

814
01:10:11,311 --> 01:10:14,280
Listen carefully,
l'm going to propose Meenu,

815
01:10:14,481 --> 01:10:15,971
l'm going to tell Manju about this,

816
01:10:16,349 --> 01:10:19,546
so l've called Manju here
to say sorry to her.

817
01:10:21,555 --> 01:10:24,490
Did you call Meenu by mistake
instead of Manju?

818
01:10:24,691 --> 01:10:26,420
l'm very clear in such things.

819
01:10:26,626 --> 01:10:28,787
lt'll be more clear
if you turn back to see.

820
01:10:31,932 --> 01:10:32,728
Why is she here?

821
01:10:32,933 --> 01:10:35,026
You do get ideas instantly,
think a way out.

822
01:10:35,402 --> 01:10:37,666
Call Manju immediately and
tell sister-in-law has delivered,

823
01:10:37,871 --> 01:10:38,997
and l'm in hospital and
will not come here,

824
01:10:39,372 --> 01:10:41,363
ask her not to come.- Okay.
- Manage it somehow.

825
01:10:41,575 --> 01:10:44,544
What shall l tell boy or girl baby
if Manju asks me?

826
01:10:44,745 --> 01:10:46,576
Say something, you bloody...

827
01:10:47,380 --> 01:10:49,314
l didn't expect you here.

828
01:10:50,817 --> 01:10:53,809
Why are you here?
You don't like such places, right?

829
01:10:54,020 --> 01:10:56,113
To tell you about a proposal.

830
01:10:59,659 --> 01:11:01,820
lt's very noisy here,
let's go out and talk, come.

831
01:11:02,028 --> 01:11:04,588
lt's fine for me here.
Please sit down.

832
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:08,927
Didn't serve anything for you?

833
01:11:12,439 --> 01:11:14,304
What happened?
- lt's engaged.

834
01:11:14,508 --> 01:11:16,942
Do something, if Manju comes here,
we are finished.

835
01:11:17,744 --> 01:11:22,647
lt's ringing.
Meenu is waiting there, l'll go.

836
01:11:24,551 --> 01:11:25,984
Why did she cut the call?

837
01:11:26,620 --> 01:11:28,554
Tell me, what's that proposal?

838
01:11:28,889 --> 01:11:29,753
Tell me.

839
01:11:40,934 --> 01:11:45,633
Why are you still standing sir?
Please sit down. Sit down.

840
01:11:46,673 --> 01:11:47,799
Sit down.

841
01:11:51,378 --> 01:11:54,006
ls it Manju?
- Yes, tell me Bujji.

842
01:11:54,381 --> 01:11:57,350
Krish will not come to the pub,
his sister-in-law had a delivery just now,

843
01:11:57,551 --> 01:11:58,449
he's in hospital,

844
01:11:58,652 --> 01:12:00,244
don't ask me if it's boy or girl,

845
01:12:00,487 --> 01:12:02,045
he'll not come there,
he told you not to come there.

846

Please don't come.

You stop it now.

848
01:12:18,471 --> 01:12:18,937
Oh no!

849
01:12:19,306 --> 01:12:20,864
Come here!

850
01:12:21,575 --> 01:12:22,769
Come l say!

851
01:12:24,978 --> 01:12:25,945
Hit a dead end?

852
01:12:26,313 --> 01:12:28,781
What are you saying?
Sit here.

853
01:12:33,086 --> 01:12:34,519
What are you thinking?

854
01:12:34,721 --> 01:12:36,882
He'll run if you let him go.

855
01:12:39,492 --> 01:12:42,086
Dhoni! What's the score?

856
01:12:42,462 --> 01:12:44,555
Yuvraj got out just now?

857
01:12:44,764 --> 01:12:47,096
l'm batting next,
l must buy a bat.

858
01:12:48,435 --> 01:12:49,732
You sit here, dear.

859
01:12:51,538 --> 01:12:53,005
You need counseling.

860
01:12:53,673 --> 01:12:55,641
Never heard the word conselling?

861
01:12:56,009 --> 01:12:58,239
Just passed higher secondary,
you wouldn't have heard it?

862
01:12:58,445 --> 01:13:00,743
What really had happened was?
- Don't spin new tales.

863
01:13:00,947 --> 01:13:02,380
Why did you play this double game?

864
01:13:02,582 --> 01:13:03,674
You showed my photo to her
and her photo to me,

865
01:13:03,884 --> 01:13:05,749
you told bad about her to me,

866
01:13:06,353 --> 01:13:09,584
l got complete details about you
in office, so l met Manju,

867
01:13:09,789 --> 01:13:11,620
what if we hadn't met?

868
01:13:13,460 --> 01:13:17,658
What really happened was,
l first saw Manju,

869
01:13:17,864 --> 01:13:20,059
l thought of making her fall for me,

870
01:13:20,767 --> 01:13:24,533
no...no...l saw you first,
l mean saw your photo,

871
01:13:24,738 --> 01:13:26,603
l showed that photo to Manju,
didn't l show you?

872
01:13:26,773 --> 01:13:27,501
l showed her.

873
01:13:27,707 --> 01:13:30,699
Another day Manju was about to
propose to me in the train,

874
01:13:30,911 --> 01:13:33,573
then the girl in the photo, l mean
you came and sat next to me,

875
01:13:33,780 --> 01:13:37,079
then Manju saw you and
you saw me, l saw Manju...

876
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:43,621
Forget about everything,
but one thing in it is true.

877
01:13:45,659 --> 01:13:49,561
Was l yearning all these days
to meet a cheat like you?

878
01:13:51,464 --> 01:13:53,830
You've made the
word friend worthless.

879
01:13:55,035 --> 01:13:56,798
Do you know why l came here today?

880
01:14:03,276 --> 01:14:04,903
Do you know why l slapped you?

881
01:14:05,412 --> 01:14:09,405
l must make you remember
this moment.

882
01:14:16,957 --> 01:14:19,585
l'm not that type, l'm different.

883
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:23,054
She doesn't have anyone,
l've many.

884
01:14:23,663 --> 01:14:25,654
l'll spare with a slap.

885
01:14:26,299 --> 01:14:27,960
l'll blow you up with bombs.

886
01:14:30,503 --> 01:14:33,836
She's threatening to blow you up,
may be with powerful background.

887
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:35,598
l'm scared.

888
01:14:50,924 --> 01:14:52,983
Brother! lt's been many days
since l saw you.

889
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:55,521
l thought you'll comeback as
a Minister but returned as MP,

890
01:14:55,729 --> 01:14:56,491
Why don't you answer me?

891
01:14:56,696 --> 01:14:58,391
Bloody bastard!

892
01:14:59,666 --> 01:15:03,830
You came running scared
fearing an old man firing at you.

893
01:15:04,037 --> 01:15:08,030
Who is he?
Show him, come...show him. Come!

894
01:15:19,019 --> 01:15:21,852
ls it your briefcase, sir?
- No sir.

895
01:15:23,490 --> 01:15:25,856
ls it your briefcase, sir?
- No sir.

896
01:15:26,926 --> 01:15:28,257
lt's mine.

897
01:15:29,963 --> 01:15:33,797
Yours? People are leaving bomb
filled briefcases everywhere.

898
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,934
Thought this too has bomb in it.

899
01:15:36,302 --> 01:15:37,894
Why don't you thank me for it?

900
01:16:18,711 --> 01:16:23,045
Brother! Who did this to us?
l'll kill him, leave me.

901
01:16:40,900 --> 01:16:45,928
Don't get tensed, l just wanted
to show you how death will be.

902
01:16:46,940 --> 01:16:49,932
Return tickets to Delhi.

903
01:16:50,310 --> 01:16:52,471
l'm giving you time till evening.

904
01:16:52,679 --> 01:16:56,080
lf you stay here tonight,
tomorrow you'll be dead.

905
01:16:57,684 --> 01:17:01,518
You'll never find the people
you're searching.

906
01:17:01,721 --> 01:17:05,623
Even if you find them, they will not live.
l'll not let them live.

907
01:17:06,659 --> 01:17:09,719
l'll be sworn-in as Minister
on Telugu new year day.

908
01:17:09,963 --> 01:17:13,831
l'll get the sweet of the new year soup
and you'll get the bitter.

909
01:17:17,003 --> 01:17:21,406
Who is he referring about not finding?
Who are they?

910
01:17:36,203 --> 01:17:40,731
10 injured in a bomb blast
near Gachibowli stadium.

911
01:17:40,874 --> 01:17:43,604
lnjured are getting treated
in Global hospital.

912
01:17:43,978 --> 01:17:46,173
Police suspect terrorists
behind the attack.

913
01:17:46,380 --> 01:17:49,178
Local MP Simhachalam has
condemned the incident.

914
01:17:49,383 --> 01:17:51,943
Terrorism is on rise in this country,

915
01:17:52,152 --> 01:17:54,120
l don't know who was
the target of the attack,

916
01:17:54,321 --> 01:17:56,186
l'm condemning it.

917
01:17:57,291 --> 01:18:03,025
Why didn't you have juice?
Please have some.

918
01:18:03,897 --> 01:18:06,331
Not able to speak?

919
01:18:06,533 --> 01:18:09,866
Why are you still here useless idiots?
Go get the doctor.

920
01:18:10,070 --> 01:18:12,368
Okay sister, you stay here,
l'll get the doctor.

921
01:18:17,645 --> 01:18:18,669
Keep this.

922
01:18:19,613 --> 01:18:21,478
No doctors here?

923
01:18:25,085 --> 01:18:27,576
No senior doctors here?

924
01:18:33,427 --> 01:18:35,224
l'm convinced, please come.

925
01:18:38,399 --> 01:18:39,832
Greetings sir.

926
01:18:40,300 --> 01:18:44,066
He's not reacting to anything
ever since the bomb blast.

927
01:18:44,271 --> 01:18:47,104
Limbs too are not moving.
Unable to speak also.

928
01:18:47,307 --> 01:18:48,604
My sister is very worried.

929
01:18:48,976 --> 01:18:52,434
Everything is written in it.
- About my sister's worry too?

930
01:18:53,480 --> 01:18:55,107
You check him.

931
01:18:57,584 --> 01:18:58,516
Raise the leg.

932
01:18:59,887 --> 01:19:02,651
Not yours the patient's.

933
01:19:03,057 --> 01:19:05,184
Stop bad habits.

934
01:19:10,631 --> 01:19:11,893
My brother isn't serious, right?

935
01:19:12,099 --> 01:19:14,499
Nothing very serious,
nerves tightened in shock,

936
01:19:14,702 --> 01:19:17,364
daily an injection can bring
him back to normal.

937
01:19:17,938 --> 01:19:19,303
What's the guaranty?

938
01:19:19,506 --> 01:19:21,098
Who is your father?
- Subba Rao.

939
01:19:21,308 --> 01:19:22,536
What's the guaranty?

940
01:19:28,449 --> 01:19:31,475
Why are you so sad?
Your brother is safe.

941
01:19:32,219 --> 01:19:35,120
l got you.
Are you sad about those two girls?

942
01:19:35,322 --> 01:19:36,619
Meenu is torturing me in dreams.

943
01:19:36,990 --> 01:19:40,323
lt was Manju in my dreams
with two bombs.

944
01:19:40,527 --> 01:19:44,987
l'm sure she belongs to
some terrorist outfit.- Shut up!

945
01:19:47,267 --> 01:19:49,030
Did you give anesthesia
to the patient?

946
01:19:49,236 --> 01:19:51,204
Where's the nurse?
Give me the knife.

947
01:20:00,496 --> 01:20:02,726
Slowly...slowly...leave me.

948
01:20:03,566 --> 01:20:07,400
Who do you think l'm?
A famous doctor of this city.

949
01:20:07,603 --> 01:20:09,696
l can tell the time of death
just by looking at the patient.

950
01:20:10,072 --> 01:20:11,733
l can diagnose disease
just by reading the pulse.

951
01:20:12,107 --> 01:20:15,133
Bringing such a great doctor...
- That's why you've been brought here.

952
01:20:15,344 --> 01:20:17,005
Come fast and check.

953
01:20:17,212 --> 01:20:17,940
Who are you?

954
01:20:18,147 --> 01:20:19,978
He's my younger brother,
l'm his elder sister.

955
01:20:20,182 --> 01:20:22,275
Come fast and see him.

956
01:20:25,421 --> 01:20:26,615
He's a man, isn't he?

957
01:20:43,038 --> 01:20:45,370
No use...absolutely no use.

958
01:20:45,574 --> 01:20:49,237
Eyes, nose, mouth,
no part of him is working.

959
01:20:49,445 --> 01:20:52,209
Can't he stay out of bomb blasts?

960
01:20:52,414 --> 01:20:54,712
l was the target of the bomb attack.

961
01:20:56,585 --> 01:20:58,576
We mustn't handle such cases.

962
01:20:58,954 --> 01:21:02,253
What if police file case on me?
l can't do it.

963
01:21:05,661 --> 01:21:09,062
Why? Why didn't you call the police?

964
01:21:09,264 --> 01:21:11,926
Tell me...what do you want me to say?

965
01:21:12,134 --> 01:21:17,265
Bloody! Say sorry to the doctor.
Say sorry.

966
01:21:18,007 --> 01:21:20,532
What do you say now?
- What can l say now?

967
01:21:21,377 --> 01:21:22,605
l'll give him a shot of injection.

968
01:21:27,616 --> 01:21:30,244
Hey doctor! Give me the injection.

969
01:21:30,452 --> 01:21:33,615
He did give you an injection,
you didn't feel it.

970
01:21:33,989 --> 01:21:35,980
lt's over.
- Over? So fast?

971
01:21:36,191 --> 01:21:39,490
l didn't feel any pain.
l like this doctor very much.

972
01:21:39,695 --> 01:21:40,889
Let's keep him here till l'm better.

973
01:21:41,096 --> 01:21:43,326
Keep him here only.
- Keep me here?

974
01:21:43,532 --> 01:21:47,229
How is it possible?
l've a large hospital...practice...

975
01:21:51,273 --> 01:21:53,707
What do you say now?
- What can l say now?

976
01:21:54,543 --> 01:21:59,173
One AC room with a bed and a fridge...
- What?

977
01:21:59,481 --> 01:22:03,178
No need of anything, no AC room please,
ordinary room will do.

978
01:22:03,385 --> 01:22:06,149
Just will do, even if there's
no mat, it's okay.

979
01:22:06,355 --> 01:22:09,381
l don't get anything, you're an MP,

980
01:22:09,591 --> 01:22:12,185
why are you getting treated
hiding in my home?

981
01:22:12,394 --> 01:22:15,989
Who is the man to attack you?
What is your enmity?

982
01:22:16,198 --> 01:22:18,496
Simhachalam was my friend
in Delhi long time ago.

983
01:22:18,701 --> 01:22:19,360
Friend?

984
01:22:19,568 --> 01:22:23,527
20 years ago we both were
PA's to a Minister.

985
01:22:24,373 --> 01:22:28,969
A Lt. Colonel's daughter Saroja
used to work as steno there,

986
01:22:29,178 --> 01:22:34,206
Simhachalam fell in love with her,
married her and had a child too.

987
01:22:34,683 --> 01:22:36,412
To gain political power,

988
01:22:36,618 --> 01:22:42,022
he married second time a Kurnool
based political leader's daughter,

989
01:22:42,624 --> 01:22:47,061
a sensitive Saroja couldn't bear this and
came to Hyderabad with a year old child.

990
01:22:47,529 --> 01:22:48,689
lt was then.

991
01:22:48,964 --> 01:22:51,228
Now we both are MP's.

992
01:22:51,433 --> 01:22:55,062
Only one of us can become a Minister.

993
01:22:55,304 --> 01:23:01,038
lf l prove to the Speaker of
parliament that he has two wives,

994
01:23:01,243 --> 01:23:05,077
according to the constitution,
he'll lose the MP seat.

995
01:23:05,481 --> 01:23:07,210
l'll become a Minister then.

996
01:23:07,416 --> 01:23:10,442
You will definitely become a Minister.

997
01:23:10,652 --> 01:23:14,952
We'll find Saroja and her daughter.

998
01:23:23,065 --> 01:23:25,329
How are you, mother?

999
01:23:28,003 --> 01:23:29,732
You promised to bring him.

1000
01:23:31,039 --> 01:23:32,666
Doctors said no need operation.

1001
01:23:33,041 --> 01:23:35,669
They said nature cure will give relief.

1002
01:23:35,978 --> 01:23:39,675
l asked about your lover.

1003
01:23:43,986 --> 01:23:45,214
What happened?

1004
01:23:47,189 --> 01:23:51,523
lt's all over.
You too forget it.

1005
01:23:52,661 --> 01:23:54,219
What happened?

1006
01:23:56,298 --> 01:23:57,265
What happened, dear?

1007
01:23:57,466 --> 01:23:59,400
l got cheated, mother.

1008
01:24:04,106 --> 01:24:09,567
When you said about a good friend,
l was eagerly waiting to meet him.

1009
01:24:11,680 --> 01:24:17,710
Okay forget it, your life mustn't
become like mine.

1010
01:24:19,555 --> 01:24:20,715
Be careful dear.

1011
01:24:31,233 --> 01:24:34,259
We are having fun there but
you're sitting sadly here.

1012
01:24:34,469 --> 01:24:36,130
l'm totally confused.

1013
01:24:36,338 --> 01:24:38,238
Shall l tell you what's your confusion?

1014
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:40,431
Krish played with the lives of two girls,

1015
01:24:40,642 --> 01:24:42,610
but why am l still in love with him?

1016
01:24:42,978 --> 01:24:45,276
Yes, anyway, how could you
like such a man?

1017
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:47,880
l like such men only.
What's your problem?

1018
01:24:48,083 --> 01:24:51,211
We don't have any problem till you
throw parties like this to us.

1019
01:24:52,688 --> 01:24:54,679
Meenu was just a friend.

1020
01:24:55,057 --> 01:24:56,581
Mine was always love
from the beginning.

1021
01:24:56,959 --> 01:24:58,119
What is his idea?

1022
01:24:58,327 --> 01:25:02,229
Men are always confused,
they fall wherever there is colour.

1023
01:25:04,299 --> 01:25:07,598
Don't know why l love him
but l'm mad on him.

1024
01:25:07,970 --> 01:25:08,698
He's my life.

1025
01:25:09,104 --> 01:25:13,336
My only job is to turn him towards me
and make him fall for me.

1026
01:25:17,346 --> 01:25:21,407
You...

1027
01:25:40,302 --> 01:25:43,965
Whether you're this side or
that side or any side...

1028
01:25:44,172 --> 01:25:48,074
You're pulling me towards you...

1029
01:25:48,277 --> 01:25:52,077
Whatever l may do or see or
wherever l may be...

1030
01:25:52,281 --> 01:25:55,682
l'm always in your thoughts only...

1031
01:25:56,051 --> 01:25:59,612
l'll trap your youth...
l'll offer my youth....

1032
01:25:59,988 --> 01:26:03,890
l'll gently tune you to my way...

1033
01:26:04,092 --> 01:26:07,619
l know your intention...
l'll string your heart...

1034
01:26:07,996 --> 01:26:11,898
Play the music of
first love on it...

1035
01:26:12,100 --> 01:26:15,661
l'll devour you with my eyes...

1036
01:26:16,038 --> 01:26:20,236
l'll chew you with my smiles...

1037
01:27:04,486 --> 01:27:08,217
But you came in real
and did something...

1038
01:27:08,423 --> 01:27:12,291
lf you entice me with your beauty...

1039
01:27:12,494 --> 01:27:16,225
Would l stand guard
without stealing it?

1040
01:27:16,431 --> 01:27:20,299
l'm coming for you like
a gigantic love tidal wave...

1041
01:27:20,502 --> 01:27:24,302
Open invitation from my heart,
do come in...

1042
01:27:24,506 --> 01:27:28,237
ln my beautiful heart...
are you a rare dream?

1043
01:27:28,443 --> 01:27:30,070
Are you my life's treasure?

1044
01:27:30,278 --> 01:27:32,576
Are you legendary celebate Pravarakhya?

1045
01:28:20,562 --> 01:28:24,293
lf l'm the dew, you came like
the first ray of light...

1046
01:28:24,499 --> 01:28:28,299
You touched and
melted me fully...

1047
01:28:28,503 --> 01:28:32,269
lf l ask your lips and
you readily give it...

1048
01:28:32,474 --> 01:28:36,274
You left lovely marks of
your teeth on it...

1049
01:28:36,478 --> 01:28:40,244
l'll spoil your sleep and
take you with me...

1050
01:28:40,449 --> 01:28:44,215
l'll join you and
show you bliss...

1051
01:28:44,419 --> 01:28:48,287
Are you a romantic wave hitting me?

1052
01:28:48,490 --> 01:28:52,426
Are you my love to sweep of my feet?

1053
01:29:20,188 --> 01:29:22,952
Your father has come from Kurnool,
he's in the guest house.

1054
01:29:23,158 --> 01:29:24,591
He wants to meet you.

1055
01:29:30,665 --> 01:29:35,602
Come my dear, it's long time
since l saw you, dear.

1056
01:29:36,037 --> 01:29:42,237
Sir...sir...chicken on right,
meat on left side, taste it.

1057
01:29:47,082 --> 01:29:48,572
You go inside.

1058
01:29:48,984 --> 01:29:51,953
Look how thin she has grown,

1059
01:29:52,154 --> 01:29:53,985
despite l said no,
you sent her to the hostel.

1060
01:29:54,189 --> 01:29:55,417
Why are you getting angry on me?

1061
01:29:55,624 --> 01:30:00,687
l said there's a big guest house but
you supported her to be with friends.

1062
01:30:01,062 --> 01:30:04,589
Enough of it, we've guests
waiting for you inside.

1063
01:30:04,966 --> 01:30:07,127
Brother-in-law, my daughter Manju.

1064
01:30:07,335 --> 01:30:14,264
Manju, he's your future husband.
Name is Hariprasad.

1065
01:30:15,677 --> 01:30:19,738
His mother and father.
Do you like him?

1066
01:30:20,682 --> 01:30:22,707
Why did you arrange this
without informing me?

1067
01:30:23,084 --> 01:30:26,247
We gave birth to you
without informing you, right?

1068
01:30:26,788 --> 01:30:30,622
Take her inside and explain her.

1069
01:30:34,162 --> 01:30:36,653
What's this uncle?
Only your wish matters here?

1070
01:30:37,032 --> 01:30:40,001
Your father is dreaming of becoming
a Minister for 30 years,

1071
01:30:40,202 --> 01:30:41,897
another man is also dreaming
the same dream,

1072
01:30:42,103 --> 01:30:44,333
your father fears he may trouble you,

1073
01:30:44,539 --> 01:30:47,099
that's why he wants to marry you off
and send you to America.

1074
01:30:47,309 --> 01:30:49,300
l don't like this marriage.

1075
01:30:50,145 --> 01:30:52,443
Your father has killed many
people without telling them,

1076
01:30:52,647 --> 01:30:55,047
and left many families on streets,

1077
01:30:55,250 --> 01:30:57,081
this is the only thing he's doing
with prior intimation.

1078
01:30:57,285 --> 01:31:01,244
lf you say no, he'll do many
things without telling you.

1079
01:31:11,099 --> 01:31:13,124
Wrong boy, don't talk to God in English.

1080
01:31:13,335 --> 01:31:14,927
l was wishing you sir.
- ls it?

1081
01:31:15,136 --> 01:31:16,603
Tell me what is it?
Consecration or special prayers?

1082
01:31:16,972 --> 01:31:20,669
l hurt a girl with my lies.
Which will give better results?

1083
01:31:21,042 --> 01:31:23,135
You want forgiveness, right?

1084
01:31:23,345 --> 01:31:25,472
lf she forgives me, it means
God too has forgiven me.

1085
01:31:25,680 --> 01:31:26,942
What do you say?

1086
01:31:32,254 --> 01:31:34,449
l promised a sacrifice
also as repentance.

1087
01:31:34,656 --> 01:31:36,385
l wouldn't have come here
had l know you'll be here.

1088
01:31:36,591 --> 01:31:38,388
Don't show your face to me.

1089
01:31:42,097 --> 01:31:44,156
Shouldn't l show my face to her?

1090
01:31:47,402 --> 01:31:48,699
Why is she calling me now?

1091
01:31:49,070 --> 01:31:51,402
She chided me in English,
will she blow me up with bombs?

1092
01:31:53,441 --> 01:31:55,636
You called me,
it means you've forgiven me.

1093
01:31:56,011 --> 01:31:58,104
Do you know why l called you?

1094
01:31:58,313 --> 01:32:00,713
First say you've forgive me,
l'll listen to you then.

1095
01:32:01,383 --> 01:32:03,010
Where are you now?
- ln temple, why?

1096
01:32:03,218 --> 01:32:06,244
Swear on God,
will you do if l ask you something?

1097
01:32:06,454 --> 01:32:07,421
l will do.

1098
01:32:08,556 --> 01:32:10,080
You won't back off, will you?

1099
01:32:10,558 --> 01:32:11,525
No, l'll not.

1100
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:15,586
l'll do anything you say
for my mistake.

1101
01:32:21,202 --> 01:32:24,194
Madam, send cow ghee for lamp.

1102
01:32:26,007 --> 01:32:29,033
ls it cow ghee?
- Who said it was? Fish gravy.

1103
01:32:29,244 --> 01:32:30,734
Sir will taste it.

1104
01:32:33,348 --> 01:32:35,646
Take it away.
- Priest is overacting.

1105
01:32:35,984 --> 01:32:40,421
Very spicy, tell the cook not to come
here till the function is over.

1106
01:32:40,622 --> 01:32:42,112
There's a chance of
few getting tempted.

1107
01:32:42,324 --> 01:32:43,689
l'll read the wedding invitation.

1108
01:32:45,627 --> 01:32:47,686
Hey you stop...stop...

1109
01:33:41,049 --> 01:33:42,516
Who are you?

1110
01:33:53,628 --> 01:33:58,258
l'm not here to spoil the engagement,
you still have 10 minutes.

1111
01:34:08,543 --> 01:34:11,307
Hey moustache!
Give me that trumpet.

1112
01:34:11,980 --> 01:34:12,708
Give it.

1113
01:34:15,984 --> 01:34:17,611
Keep this as an exchange offer.

1114
01:34:25,994 --> 01:34:28,428
l'm going little overboard, right?
l'm like that.

1115
01:34:28,630 --> 01:34:31,428
lf you like, enjoy it,
even if you don't like it, endure it.

1116
01:34:46,114 --> 01:34:48,048
Marriages didn't happen like this.

1117
01:34:56,124 --> 01:35:00,390
They used to send open invitations
for groom selection,

1118
01:35:00,662 --> 01:35:02,220
people gathered like this,

1119
01:35:02,430 --> 01:35:10,064
but many princes stood next to
each other as prospective groom.

1120
01:35:10,371 --> 01:35:14,307
lf you're a prince, you need this.

1121
01:35:14,943 --> 01:35:15,568
Thanks prince.

1122
01:35:15,944 --> 01:35:21,314
All the princes were put to a simple test.
- What test?

1123
01:35:24,052 --> 01:35:27,510
l know, you'll give the knife to him,
he must aim and hit the apple.

1124
01:35:29,624 --> 01:35:33,082
lf you're a prince, hit it,
game of knife and apple.

1125
01:35:33,561 --> 01:35:36,291
He's doing too much, kill him.

1126
01:35:45,507 --> 01:35:49,204
You missed the target.
Now it's your chance.

1127
01:35:50,578 --> 01:35:52,045
Keep it on your head.

1128
01:35:53,915 --> 01:35:54,609
Hit it!

1129
01:35:55,917 --> 01:35:56,611
Hit it!

1130
01:36:02,123 --> 01:36:03,454
Two equal pieces to both kinsmen.

1131
01:36:03,658 --> 01:36:06,559
Though the boy is smaller than knife,
but he's very sharp.

1132
01:36:07,095 --> 01:36:11,589
A father who searched for
a sharp young man l those days,

1133
01:36:11,966 --> 01:36:17,268
today must find who is
his daughter's lover.

1134
01:36:17,672 --> 01:36:23,076
lf you try you'll find me in Manju's heart
and Manju in my heart.

1135
01:36:41,396 --> 01:36:43,660
Floral consecration !

1136
01:36:45,633 --> 01:36:48,659
You can't forcibly give
birth to love or kill it.

1137
01:36:49,037 --> 01:36:51,528
Despite all this if you want your daughter
to marry against her wishes,

1138
01:36:52,073 --> 01:36:53,199
do as you wish.

1139
01:36:57,278 --> 01:37:02,682
lf l had a daughter l'd prefer that
hardware guy than this software guy.

1140
01:37:03,351 --> 01:37:07,651
l want his full details.

1141
01:37:10,925 --> 01:37:11,550
Why are you standing here?

1142
01:37:11,926 --> 01:37:12,893
Are you fine?

1143
01:37:13,094 --> 01:37:14,186
l'm fine but why is an
ambulance here?

1144
01:37:14,395 --> 01:37:16,124
l expected they'll throw you
out from the roof.

1145
01:37:16,331 --> 01:37:17,889
You look fresh, what's that dot for?

1146
01:37:18,099 --> 01:37:19,532
What happened inside?

1147
01:37:19,734 --> 01:37:22,396
One job is over, l'm going.
- Where?

1148
01:37:23,571 --> 01:37:24,230
l've another job.

1149
01:37:24,439 --> 01:37:25,997
What's that?
- l'll tell you later.

1150
01:37:26,207 --> 01:37:28,505
l'll also come, wait...

1151
01:37:29,077 --> 01:37:30,476
My payment sir.

1152
01:37:33,081 --> 01:37:34,912
He didn't get hurt,
why should l pay without a patient?

1153
01:37:35,116 --> 01:37:37,175
You want a patient, right?

1154
01:37:38,553 --> 01:37:38,951
Okay?

1155
01:37:39,153 --> 01:37:41,713
Would anyone go in
ambulance for a slap?

1156
01:37:46,461 --> 01:37:47,519
That side!

1157
01:38:06,147 --> 01:38:08,445
This is very dangerous incident,

1158
01:38:08,650 --> 01:38:11,210
somebody in our office
has helped him,

1159
01:38:11,419 --> 01:38:14,115
from whose lD this message was sent?
Tell me!

1160
01:38:14,322 --> 01:38:16,756
From which idiot's lD?
- Your lD sir.

1161
01:38:18,526 --> 01:38:23,463
Me and Ruhi...sorry except me and
Meenu, all others go out.

1162
01:38:27,068 --> 01:38:30,128
Will you believe l would
do such nasty things?- No sir.

1163
01:38:30,338 --> 01:38:33,205
Thank God! l'll take care of him.

1164
01:38:33,408 --> 01:38:35,968
He's an A class criminal,
l'll plan with a B class idea,

1165
01:38:36,144 --> 01:38:37,168
and send him to C class jail.

1166
01:38:37,378 --> 01:38:40,905
You go now...go...
l'll take care of him.

1167
01:38:41,115 --> 01:38:44,482
Hey cheat! How could you send
messages from my lD sitting at home?

1168
01:38:44,686 --> 01:38:45,948
l'll call his brother
and sister-in-law.

1169
01:38:46,154 --> 01:38:48,019
Uncle!
- Uncle? Where are you?

1170
01:38:48,222 --> 01:38:51,487
Uncle!- Where are you?
- Here only, uncle!

1171
01:38:51,693 --> 01:38:53,593
Why are you getting angry?

1172
01:38:53,995 --> 01:38:57,431
How dare you sit on my table?
How about sitting in your lap?

1173
01:38:58,166 --> 01:38:59,497
l'll call your sister-in-law.
- l'll call aunty.

1174
01:38:59,701 --> 01:39:01,259
Why call aunty?
- Why call my sister-in-law?

1175
01:39:01,469 --> 01:39:03,664
l'll tell her you're playing
love games with Meenu here.

1176
01:39:04,038 --> 01:39:06,199
l'll tell aunty about your
pencil games under the table.

1177
01:39:07,141 --> 01:39:09,041
You've hit my weakest spot.

1178
01:39:09,243 --> 01:39:12,303
Trust me she was really searching
for pencil under the table that day.

1179
01:39:12,513 --> 01:39:14,378
Let her say it.

1180
01:39:14,582 --> 01:39:15,606
She's here, l'll make her say it.

1181
01:39:15,983 --> 01:39:21,478
You were really searching for a pencil
that day when he came her, right?

1182
01:39:21,689 --> 01:39:22,951
No sir.- No?

1183
01:39:23,157 --> 01:39:25,250
What were you searching then?
- How can l say it before him?

1184
01:39:25,460 --> 01:39:27,621
What are you saying?
My family will break up.

1185
01:39:27,995 --> 01:39:29,360
Don't threaten the witness.

1186
01:39:29,564 --> 01:39:31,122
But you can threaten
the defendant, right?

1187
01:39:31,332 --> 01:39:33,323
Do you've aunt's number?

1188
01:39:33,534 --> 01:39:35,331
lt'll be in sir's phone as Devil.

1189
01:39:35,536 --> 01:39:37,401
Devil? l'll tell her this also.

1190
01:39:37,705 --> 01:39:39,332
You hold the pencil perfectly.
Get out.

1191
01:39:39,540 --> 01:39:40,234
Hello! ls Devil at home?

1192
01:39:40,441 --> 01:39:41,465
Who is it?
- Devil, thank God.

1193
01:39:41,676 --> 01:39:47,706
l beg you, why did you chose to
use me for this dirty work?

1194
01:39:48,483 --> 01:39:51,509
likewise tell me
what should l do also?

1195
01:39:54,288 --> 01:39:55,084
That's all?

1196
01:39:55,289 --> 01:39:58,087
l was afraid you may ask for my office.

1197
01:39:58,960 --> 01:40:01,258
Do one thing.

1198
01:40:03,364 --> 01:40:06,265
This is urgent file,
boss wants you to finish and go.

1199
01:40:33,594 --> 01:40:36,256
Where's everyone?
lsn't there anyone here?

1200
01:40:56,117 --> 01:40:58,449
Go away, you bloody!

1201
01:40:58,653 --> 01:40:59,711
lt's me!

1202
01:41:01,689 --> 01:41:02,348
You...!

1203
01:41:02,557 --> 01:41:05,424
You told me not to show my face.
That's why l masked my face.

1204
01:41:05,993 --> 01:41:08,086
You've already pressed the top floor,
it'll go up and then come down.

1205
01:41:08,296 --> 01:41:12,426
All because of this,
how dare you scare a girl!

1206
01:41:13,234 --> 01:41:14,292
How dare you scare a girl!

1207
01:41:14,502 --> 01:41:17,630
Would l come here had you
forgiven me in the temple?

1208
01:41:18,005 --> 01:41:19,131
Will you leave if l forgive you?

1209
01:41:19,340 --> 01:41:20,967
That could happen in temple not here.

1210
01:41:21,175 --> 01:41:24,440
l came there with devotion.
l'm here after a beer.

1211
01:41:29,317 --> 01:41:31,342
Listen to me.

1212
01:41:32,053 --> 01:41:34,214
Please listen to me.

1213
01:41:34,422 --> 01:41:37,391
Why are you doing this to me?
What do you want?

1214
01:41:37,925 --> 01:41:38,914
l want your opinion on me.

1215
01:41:39,126 --> 01:41:41,060
You're a useless man.

1216
01:41:42,029 --> 01:41:43,553
ls that final?
- That's it.

1217
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:48,391
That's the opinion of my family too.

1218
01:41:49,003 --> 01:41:50,630
l got into the train to wipe that opinion.

1219
01:41:51,005 --> 01:41:53,473
Planned to make Manju fall in love
with me and escape to America.

1220
01:41:53,674 --> 01:41:56,507
But l met you and it was all over.

1221
01:41:58,246 --> 01:42:00,237
First time we met in train,

1222
01:42:00,448 --> 01:42:02,040
you sat next to me
and forgot your file,

1223
01:42:02,250 --> 01:42:03,217
l came to your office to return it,

1224
01:42:03,417 --> 01:42:06,011
unable to control yourself,
you cried and then hugged me tightly,

1225
01:42:06,220 --> 01:42:07,209
you remember it?

1226
01:42:08,456 --> 01:42:14,258
lf you were so happy,
you could've said thanks,

1227
01:42:14,629 --> 01:42:16,096
give a shake hand,

1228
01:42:16,297 --> 01:42:19,289
and say any word left behind
by the Englishmen,

1229
01:42:20,468 --> 01:42:22,732
but why did you hug me so tightly?

1230
01:42:23,704 --> 01:42:25,365
you had me there.

1231
01:42:26,574 --> 01:42:29,372
People plan spot to kill but
you planned a spot for love.

1232
01:42:30,044 --> 01:42:30,738
Ever since then, American dream went kaput,

1233
01:42:31,112 --> 01:42:33,376
Manju vanished, and l got vanquished.

1234
01:42:33,581 --> 01:42:43,684
Whatever l do or wherever l go,
eat, sleep or drink, it's you everywhere.

1235
01:42:44,125 --> 01:42:45,888
To say it simply,

1236
01:42:46,460 --> 01:42:49,224
like they use BC and AD in history,

1237
01:42:49,430 --> 01:42:51,660
like that if you split my life into two,

1238
01:42:52,033 --> 01:42:54,524
before hugging and after hugging.

1239
01:42:54,969 --> 01:42:58,063
Will love develop for a mere hug?
- Will it not?

1240
01:43:18,059 --> 01:43:22,655
Felt anything? Not even a bit?

1241
01:43:25,700 --> 01:43:27,725
You're also lying like me.

1242
01:43:28,302 --> 01:43:29,496
No...no...no...

1243
01:43:29,704 --> 01:43:31,001
Then l'm really useless guy.

1244
01:43:31,205 --> 01:43:32,263
God!

1245
01:43:32,974 --> 01:43:33,702
What?

1246
01:43:34,075 --> 01:43:35,099
Can't hear me?

1247
01:43:35,309 --> 01:43:36,207
Wait, l'm coming up.

1248
01:43:39,013 --> 01:43:41,379
Can you hear me now?

1249
01:43:42,016 --> 01:43:43,449
Why did you send me to this earth?

1250
01:43:43,651 --> 01:43:45,642
Like a wanderer's symbol
and a useless man's emblem.

1251
01:43:46,153 --> 01:43:47,643
Failing in studies is my mistake,

1252
01:43:48,022 --> 01:43:49,683
unable to find a job is my mistake,

1253
01:43:50,057 --> 01:43:53,652
but if she says she can't love me,
it's your mistake.

1254
01:43:54,462 --> 01:43:56,692
l'm coming up there to settle
this issue directly with you.

1255
01:43:58,099 --> 01:44:03,230
There's expiry date for
everything on earth except love.

1256
01:44:03,637 --> 01:44:05,502
Because it'll not die
till we kill it.

1257
01:44:06,207 --> 01:44:09,506
That's why unable to kill my love,
l'm killing myself.

1258
01:44:10,478 --> 01:44:12,173
Will you do me a last favour?

1259
01:44:12,380 --> 01:44:15,281
Count to 3, l'll jump down.

1260
01:44:15,950 --> 01:44:16,712
Count!

1261
01:44:20,654 --> 01:44:25,091
See, God started the count
though you refused.

1262
01:44:57,291 --> 01:44:59,054
Why are you upside down?

1263
01:44:59,293 --> 01:45:01,056
ls everyone like this in hell?

1264
01:45:41,402 --> 01:45:43,427
l dreamt...

1265
01:45:43,637 --> 01:45:46,572
l thought l dreamt...

1266
01:45:50,945 --> 01:45:52,936
Found out...

1267
01:45:53,147 --> 01:45:56,048
l found out it is true...

1268
01:46:00,287 --> 01:46:04,587
Separation vanished and
hearts came closer...

1269
01:46:04,959 --> 01:46:08,690
Dark nights turned into
bright moonlit nights...

1270
01:46:09,430 --> 01:46:11,694
Truth is absolute...

1271
01:46:12,066 --> 01:46:14,057
Slowly dawned on me to realise...

1272
01:46:14,268 --> 01:46:17,704
l forgot heart after knowing it...

1273
01:46:18,639 --> 01:46:20,903
lf there's heaven...

1274
01:46:21,108 --> 01:46:23,406
lf there's hell...

1275
01:47:20,301 --> 01:47:22,326
Fought it out with silence...

1276
01:47:22,536 --> 01:47:24,595
Secured your heart...

1277
01:47:24,972 --> 01:47:29,272
l got back your love...

1278
01:47:29,476 --> 01:47:31,603
l gave myself to you...

1279
01:47:31,979 --> 01:47:34,106
l took you into me...

1280
01:47:34,315 --> 01:47:38,911
l'm also in your mistakes...

1281
01:47:39,119 --> 01:47:43,453
Time moved fast to separate us...

1282
01:47:43,657 --> 01:47:47,525
lt lost the game playing with us...

1283
01:47:48,462 --> 01:47:50,521
ln love separation is unavoidable...

1284
01:47:50,731 --> 01:47:52,995
But it'll not stand long...

1285
01:47:53,200 --> 01:47:57,603
True love always wins...

1286
01:49:01,468 --> 01:49:03,493
Love clouds are thundering...

1287
01:49:03,704 --> 01:49:05,934
My love has broken her silence...

1288
01:49:06,140 --> 01:49:10,440
lt's raining love on me...

1289
01:49:10,678 --> 01:49:13,010
l thought you were rock...

1290
01:49:13,213 --> 01:49:15,272
l misunderstood in anger...

1291
01:49:15,482 --> 01:49:20,010
Now l see the statue hidden
inside the rock...

1292
01:49:20,220 --> 01:49:24,680
l was running always...
l stopped for you only...

1293
01:49:25,059 --> 01:49:29,359
l'm getting imprisoned
in your eyes...

1294
01:49:29,563 --> 01:49:31,656
Between the beat of your heart...

1295
01:49:32,032 --> 01:49:34,159
l'm hiding my heart...

1296
01:49:34,368 --> 01:49:38,702
l desire union with you only...

1297
01:50:15,676 --> 01:50:17,940
You must do something, sister-in-law,

1298
01:50:18,245 --> 01:50:20,076
looks like my brother-in-law
has come back home,

1299
01:50:20,280 --> 01:50:21,338
didn't turn up last night also?

1300
01:50:21,548 --> 01:50:24,108
Looks like he's back now.

1301
01:50:24,485 --> 01:50:25,747
l'll call you later.

1302
01:50:26,353 --> 01:50:28,116
ls this Krishnakant's house?

1303
01:50:28,322 --> 01:50:30,415
Yes, but he's not in home.

1304
01:50:30,991 --> 01:50:31,616
Brother-in-law!

1305
01:50:36,630 --> 01:50:39,064
Did he do anything?

1306
01:50:39,700 --> 01:50:41,691
He did what he's supposed to do,

1307
01:50:42,069 --> 01:50:44,230
we are here to do
what we are supposed to do.

1308
01:50:45,472 --> 01:50:46,996
You're no ordinary man.

1309
01:50:47,207 --> 01:50:50,040
You made a girl say l love you
who hated you till yesterday.

1310
01:50:50,244 --> 01:50:51,905
Overnight you reached the top.

1311
01:50:52,112 --> 01:50:53,909
Just seven more steps.

1312
01:50:54,114 --> 01:50:56,708
My love is Meenu,
my marriage is with Meenu only.

1313
01:50:58,652 --> 01:51:04,318
My daughter said she'll marry
your brother-in-law only.

1314
01:51:05,025 --> 01:51:09,485
My brother-in-law would've taken
his limbs for this act normally,

1315
01:51:09,696 --> 01:51:12,688
he's here to see happiness
in his daughter's eyes.

1316
01:51:13,066 --> 01:51:14,727
Though he's worth trillions!

1317
01:51:15,602 --> 01:51:17,433
Please sit down, dear.
Sit down.

1318
01:51:18,105 --> 01:51:21,597
How much you'll give for engagement?
- Rs.100 crores.

1319
01:51:23,510 --> 01:51:24,101
Please sit down, dear.

1320
01:51:24,645 --> 01:51:26,704
He'll give another Rs.500 crores
on marriage day.

1321
01:51:27,214 --> 01:51:30,615
l think it's delivery time,
stand and hear it.

1322
01:51:30,984 --> 01:51:34,078
lf your husband was here,
we could talk about other things too.

1323
01:51:34,288 --> 01:51:37,382
He's inside, l'll push and bring him.

1324
01:51:37,591 --> 01:51:39,388
Push him?

1325
01:51:40,127 --> 01:51:41,560
Such a wealthy proposal has
come for your brother,

1326
01:51:41,929 --> 01:51:43,089
but you're not in a situation
to greet also.

1327
01:51:43,297 --> 01:51:45,060
Don't know what to do.

1328
01:52:02,216 --> 01:52:06,676
He got totally paralyzed in the accident.
l'll take him inside.

1329
01:52:07,387 --> 01:52:08,911
Looks like you'll spoil the chances.

1330
01:52:09,156 --> 01:52:11,056
l took you out unnecessarily.

1331
01:52:11,258 --> 01:52:14,694
Come...come...keep it there.

1332
01:52:17,030 --> 01:52:20,522
These are my brother-in-law's
gifts for you.

1333
01:52:21,502 --> 01:52:22,628
l'll take leave, dear.
l'll call you in near future.

1334
01:52:23,003 --> 01:52:23,697
Let's fix the marriage date.

1335
01:52:24,071 --> 01:52:25,629
lnform son-in-law that l was here.

1336
01:52:26,006 --> 01:52:28,736
Okay, greetings.- Greetings.
- Bye.- Uncle!

1337
01:52:29,076 --> 01:52:32,443
ln Nellore they offer waist belt for
sister-in-law for engagement.

1338
01:52:32,646 --> 01:52:35,581
That bag is full of jewellary,
wear it.

1339
01:52:42,589 --> 01:52:44,386
This is not our home, let's go.

1340
01:52:44,925 --> 01:52:45,687
Sister-in-law!

1341
01:52:47,427 --> 01:52:50,225
Brother-in-law! Come here!

1342
01:52:52,399 --> 01:52:55,960
lf l had two more hands and
another neck, l could wear all.

1343
01:52:56,169 --> 01:52:56,999
Am l beautiful?

1344
01:52:57,204 --> 01:52:59,172
You look like pregnant Chandramukhi, sister?

1345
01:52:59,373 --> 01:53:01,398
Where did you get all these
things and jewels?

1346
01:53:01,608 --> 01:53:05,510
Hit any lottery? How much?
- Rs.1000 crores!

1347
01:53:06,446 --> 01:53:08,414
Stay like that only!

1348
01:53:08,549 --> 01:53:10,642
You like sweets, right? Eat!

1349
01:53:11,018 --> 01:53:13,987
Brother-in-law, sit on the new sofa.

1350
01:53:14,187 --> 01:53:15,950
Watching all this is confusing me, sister.

1351
01:53:16,156 --> 01:53:18,181
Am l not confused myself?

1352
01:53:18,392 --> 01:53:21,520
MP came on his own to give his
daughter in marriage to Krish.

1353
01:53:21,662 --> 01:53:22,458
Which MP, sister-in-law?

1354
01:53:22,663 --> 01:53:25,632
Don't you know MP Simhachalam?

1355
01:53:25,999 --> 01:53:27,523
Don't you know you love his daughter?

1356
01:53:27,734 --> 01:53:30,032
Don't you know about going to
his home to say you love her?

1357
01:53:30,237 --> 01:53:31,033
Did he come here?

1358
01:53:31,238 --> 01:53:32,262
He gave all these gifts too.

1359
01:53:32,472 --> 01:53:34,736
That's why l accepted
the marriage proposal.

1360
01:53:43,283 --> 01:53:45,547
l was thinking about you
and you called me.

1361
01:53:45,919 --> 01:53:46,977
How are the things l sent for you?

1362
01:53:47,187 --> 01:53:48,984
Do l look like an item to you?

1363
01:53:49,189 --> 01:53:52,056
l'm in cool water,
why are you so hot?

1364
01:53:52,593 --> 01:53:55,892
Don't divert me,
answer my question straight,

1365
01:53:56,096 --> 01:53:57,586
what did you request me a day earlier?

1366
01:53:57,965 --> 01:54:01,162
l told you to spoil the engagement
which was against my wishes.

1367
01:54:01,368 --> 01:54:02,596
No, you said one more thing.

1368
01:54:02,970 --> 01:54:05,564
l told you to tell my father
that you love me.

1369
01:54:05,939 --> 01:54:07,406
That's not true, right?

1370
01:54:07,641 --> 01:54:10,235
But my love is also not false, right?

1371
01:54:10,544 --> 01:54:14,708
Look Manju...
- lf you see me now in this...Look...

1372
01:54:16,683 --> 01:54:18,014
l don't love you.

1373
01:54:18,218 --> 01:54:20,083
Why did you send you father
to my home knowing it well?

1374
01:54:20,287 --> 01:54:23,017
You asked to come to reality, l will.

1375
01:54:23,223 --> 01:54:26,192
You made me fall in love.
l fell!

1376
01:54:26,460 --> 01:54:29,190
l'm giving you 48 hours time,
think over it,

1377
01:54:29,396 --> 01:54:31,261
else my family has a tradition,

1378
01:54:31,465 --> 01:54:33,399
my father will say l'll kill you,

1379
01:54:33,600 --> 01:54:35,500
my mother will say
l'll get you killed,

1380
01:54:35,702 --> 01:54:37,863
l'll say l'll kill myself.

1381
01:54:39,239 --> 01:54:40,866
lf you say no!

1382
01:54:43,343 --> 01:54:44,310
What happened?

1383
01:54:44,511 --> 01:54:45,535
She trapped me.

1384
01:54:45,912 --> 01:54:47,004
Bloody...

1385
01:54:47,214 --> 01:54:49,512
Not with her, l'll talk to her father.

1386
01:54:51,551 --> 01:54:54,076
All your ways are closed.
l won sir.

1387
01:54:54,287 --> 01:55:00,055
As you promised l can go if l win,
l won so l'm leaving.

1388
01:55:05,298 --> 01:55:07,391
Your game is mine
and mine is yours.

1389
01:55:11,405 --> 01:55:13,339
Answer the phone.

1390
01:55:17,310 --> 01:55:18,572
Give the phone to boss.

1391
01:55:19,079 --> 01:55:20,068
Your phone.

1392
01:55:20,280 --> 01:55:22,407
Give the phone to boss, he said.

1393
01:55:24,217 --> 01:55:25,377
Congratulations sir.

1394
01:55:25,585 --> 01:55:26,677
You're going to become the Minister.

01:55:36,263 --> 01:55:37,855
What will happen in an hour?

01:55:38,065 --> 01:55:40,397
Your brother is going to become
a Minister in an hour, sister.

1400
01:55:40,600 --> 01:55:41,658
Really?

1401

01:55:45,405 --> 01:55:48,203

01:56:46,199 --> 01:56:48,667
What happened?
Tell me what happened?

1407
01:57:16,997 --> 01:57:18,430
Got fooled, brother-in-law?

1408
01:57:18,632 --> 01:57:22,466
You gave tension to her for few days,
we surprised you !

1409
01:57:22,669 --> 01:57:25,069
Are you angry?

1410
01:57:31,678 --> 01:57:32,576
Come on !

1411
01:57:36,316 --> 01:57:38,409
Kill him!

1412
01:57:42,122 --> 01:57:43,589
Leave me...
- Who are you?

1413
01:57:49,229 --> 01:57:50,594
Leave me!

1414
01:58:29,436 --> 01:58:30,596
Stop it!

1415
01:58:36,309 --> 01:58:37,571
Kill him!

1416
01:59:53,053 --> 01:59:56,420
He's catching up with us.
l'm scared!

1417
02:00:21,081 --> 02:00:23,447
Bloody!

1418
02:00:40,433 --> 02:00:42,526
Looks like they'll not leave, get down.

1419
02:00:43,036 --> 02:00:44,060
Get down !

1420
02:00:47,707 --> 02:00:50,267
l swear on Goddess Mysamma!

1421
02:01:31,718 --> 02:01:34,118
Hop on...hop on !

1422
02:01:47,367 --> 02:01:48,231
Who are they?

1423
02:01:49,536 --> 02:01:50,298
l'm asking you.

1424
02:01:52,972 --> 02:01:53,904
l want water.

1425
02:02:01,681 --> 02:02:03,080
Tell me now, who were they?

1426
02:02:04,617 --> 02:02:05,015
l don't know.

1427
02:02:05,218 --> 02:02:07,652
You say you don't know
but why are they after you?

1428
02:02:08,021 --> 02:02:09,955
l don't know.
- Don't you know really?

1429
02:02:10,156 --> 02:02:11,350
l don't know.

1430
02:02:14,394 --> 02:02:15,725
Don't know where this idiot is?

1431
02:02:18,998 --> 02:02:20,124
What?
- Where are you?

1432
02:02:20,333 --> 02:02:21,357
Waiting near MP Simhachalam's home.

1433
02:02:21,568 --> 02:02:22,296
What are you doing there?

1434
02:02:22,502 --> 02:02:26,438
You came this side, right?
l'm waiting with an ambulance here.

1435
02:02:27,640 --> 02:02:31,132
Come immediately to the
supermarket near our apartments.- Why?

1436
02:02:31,344 --> 02:02:34,108
l'll tell you later, come immediately.
- On the way!

1437
02:02:47,727 --> 02:02:49,490
May be one of the gang
that chased us.

1438
02:02:49,696 --> 02:02:51,220
Worse than those goons.

1439
02:02:51,931 --> 02:02:53,057
My sister-in-law!

1440
02:02:54,467 --> 02:02:56,662
Sister-in-law, she's...
- No need to tell me.

1441
02:02:57,036 --> 02:03:01,473
ln Nellore they don't roam
around with future wife.

1442
02:03:01,674 --> 02:03:07,169
She's almost a replica of her father.

1443
02:03:07,380 --> 02:03:09,211
Don't l know who she is?

1444
02:03:09,415 --> 02:03:12,009
lsn't she MP Simhachalam's daughter?

1445
02:03:12,218 --> 02:03:13,708
She's like a doll.

1446
02:03:15,121 --> 02:03:16,281
lt's not...

1447
02:03:16,956 --> 02:03:18,423
lt fell down, please help me.

1448
02:03:19,325 --> 02:03:22,658
l'll tell you about her later,
just say yes to all her questions.

1449
02:03:23,029 --> 02:03:24,257
Not to me, to her.

1450
02:03:26,399 --> 02:03:28,094
ls it good?

1451
02:03:28,334 --> 02:03:29,733
What about this?

1452
02:03:30,103 --> 02:03:32,401
Your father gave all this.

1453
02:03:32,605 --> 02:03:36,097
ln Nellore we don't let the future
daughter-in-law to enter our home,

1454
02:03:36,309 --> 02:03:40,541
but he's very eager,
why don't you come to home once?

1455
02:03:41,548 --> 02:03:44,449
Why are you scratching her
when she says okay?

1456
02:03:44,651 --> 02:03:49,452
lf we don't take her home,
what would her father think of us?

1457
02:03:49,656 --> 02:03:51,055
lsn't it dear?

1458
02:03:55,495 --> 02:03:58,225
Why are you startled?
Come here.

1459
02:03:58,364 --> 02:04:01,663
Who do you think she is?
MP's daughter.

1460
02:04:02,635 --> 02:04:04,068
Greet her.

1461
02:04:04,537 --> 02:04:05,299
Greet.

1462
02:04:05,505 --> 02:04:07,700
Greetings to MP's daughter.

1463
02:04:10,643 --> 02:04:12,076
Come in dear.
Stop...stop...

1464
02:04:12,278 --> 02:04:14,075
Step in putting right leg first.

1465
02:04:15,949 --> 02:04:19,476
When l see you walking in,
l feel like millions rupees walking in.

1466
02:04:19,686 --> 02:04:25,921
This plasma TV, fridge, silver ware,
sofa, all are your dad's gifts.

1467
02:04:26,125 --> 02:04:30,084
You came here for the first time,
l'll get you some sweets.

1468
02:04:30,396 --> 02:04:32,125
What's going here?
l don't get anything.

1469
02:04:32,332 --> 02:04:33,731
Tell me, l'm asking you.
- Stop it.

1470
02:04:34,567 --> 02:04:35,397
My sister-in-law is native of Nellore,

1471
02:04:35,602 --> 02:04:38,628
her parents lost money in Mica mines
near Gudur, they became lP,

1472
02:04:39,005 --> 02:04:42,031
so she behaves
sometimes very strangely.

1473
02:04:42,909 --> 02:04:45,036
So don't take her words seriously.
Okay?

1474
02:04:46,279 --> 02:04:47,610
She's coming.

1475
02:04:48,047 --> 02:04:50,038
Take sweet.

1476
02:04:51,317 --> 02:04:53,877
Why just a little bit?

1477
02:04:54,087 --> 02:04:56,146
ln Nellore we eat the entire box.

1478
02:04:56,356 --> 02:04:58,017
Your father brought it, eat.

1479
02:04:58,224 --> 02:05:00,692
l eat a lot in home.

1480
02:05:02,161 --> 02:05:03,685
She's getting into the
skin of the character.

1481
02:05:04,364 --> 02:05:10,098
Your father sent many jewels and
silver ware, come and see.

1482
02:05:10,303 --> 02:05:13,704
l bought it as gifts
which my father gave you.

1483
02:05:14,641 --> 02:05:16,609
lf you're King of apple polishing,
she's the queen of apple polishing.

1484
02:05:16,976 --> 02:05:20,241
Atleast see the saris, come dear.

1485
02:05:48,641 --> 02:05:51,041
You've committed a grave mistake.

1486
02:05:53,946 --> 02:05:55,641
How many shots of antibiotic
injections you give me everyday?

1487
02:05:56,015 --> 02:05:57,676
You faint for two shots only.

1488
02:05:58,051 --> 02:06:01,020
What if ten shots are given at a time?
- You'll die.

1489
02:06:01,220 --> 02:06:05,486
Then, give all these guys
ten shots of injections.

1490
02:06:11,664 --> 02:06:13,655
No need to waste time for
ten shots of injections.

1491
02:06:14,033 --> 02:06:18,231
My brother gave you a good clue,
the girl you left behind,

1492
02:06:18,438 --> 02:06:22,101
he asked you to find to which address
her grandfather's pension goes?

1493
02:06:22,308 --> 02:06:25,038
You found that and
she lives in a hostel,

1494
02:06:25,244 --> 02:06:28,338
and promised to bring her here in an hour,
where is she?

1495
02:06:29,182 --> 02:06:31,446
Had you brought mother
and daughter with you?

1496
02:06:31,651 --> 02:06:35,018
My brother would've been
a Minister by now.

1497
02:06:35,221 --> 02:06:39,351
Sir, he's still alive.
Shall we take him to the hospital?

1498
02:06:41,527 --> 02:06:43,518
Will you take him to the hospital?
Shut up!

1499
02:06:48,401 --> 02:06:50,995
When soldiers fail to deliver,

1500
02:06:51,471 --> 02:06:53,530
King will enter the arena,

1501
02:06:53,973 --> 02:06:55,372
l'll catch that girl myself,

1502
02:06:55,575 --> 02:06:59,636
till then sit here wearing
these bangles.

1503
02:07:03,116 --> 02:07:05,243
No need of so many jewels,
l don't like it.

1504
02:07:05,451 --> 02:07:09,387
Why still calling me formally?
We are relatives.

1505
02:07:09,589 --> 02:07:11,386
Address me as sister!
Just one more.

1506
02:07:11,591 --> 02:07:14,424
Take her away from here immediately.

1507
02:07:14,627 --> 02:07:17,926
Looks like we are sitting on a time
bomb which may go off anytime.

1508
02:07:18,131 --> 02:07:19,598
Where am l to take her?
Don't you know that?

1509
02:07:22,301 --> 02:07:23,393
How is she?

1510
02:07:23,603 --> 02:07:25,696
Like a mannequin in a jewellary shop.

1511
02:07:26,339 --> 02:07:28,569
Her father may be waiting,
l'll drop her.

1512
02:07:28,941 --> 02:07:31,341
Brother-in-law, wait, you come dear.

1513
02:07:31,544 --> 02:07:35,173
You know who she is,
our daughter-in-law.

1514
02:07:39,552 --> 02:07:40,610
My brother, you met him in temple.

1515
02:07:40,987 --> 02:07:42,716
Why are you staring?
Take his blessings.

1516
02:07:43,089 --> 02:07:44,317
Your brother-in-law!

1517
02:07:45,491 --> 02:07:47,356
Good, now let's go.

1518
02:07:47,560 --> 02:07:49,084
Sister-in-law, she...

1519
02:07:49,495 --> 02:07:50,587
What's it, brother?

1520
02:07:51,998 --> 02:07:54,990
Are you surprised to see this girl
instead of that girl?

1521
02:07:55,201 --> 02:07:57,465
l love Meenu and will marry her only.

1522
02:07:57,670 --> 02:07:59,001
Why are you beating him?

1523
02:07:59,205 --> 02:08:01,105
What do you want, brother?

1524
02:08:01,441 --> 02:08:02,465
You want me to take you there?

1525
02:08:02,675 --> 02:08:03,471
Come.

1526
02:08:04,477 --> 02:08:05,273
Come.

1527
02:08:07,647 --> 02:08:08,443
Where?

1528
02:08:11,417 --> 02:08:12,441
Where?

1529
02:08:14,620 --> 02:08:15,951
Why is he pointing towards calendar?

1530
02:08:16,155 --> 02:08:18,623
May be he'll say something
using the numbers.

1531
02:08:35,074 --> 02:08:36,701
MP Simhachalam?

1532
02:08:37,310 --> 02:08:40,177
Do you want us to vote for him?

1533
02:08:40,313 --> 02:08:41,109
You wait.

1534
02:08:41,314 --> 02:08:42,576
What about MP Simhachalam?

1535
02:08:54,193 --> 02:08:56,252
ls Meenu facing danger
from MP Simhachalam?

1536
02:08:56,462 --> 02:08:59,090
Why would he come for Meenu?

1537
02:08:59,398 --> 02:09:03,698
Are the men who tried to
kidnap Meenu Simhachalam's men?

1538
02:09:04,670 --> 02:09:07,332
Why would a faction leader
be interested in Meenu?

1539
02:09:10,510 --> 02:09:12,444
Are you tensed?

1540
02:09:14,247 --> 02:09:16,738
l welcomed Shinde with bombs,

1541
02:09:17,149 --> 02:09:19,515
l warned him to leave this state,

1542
02:09:19,719 --> 02:09:21,619
neither he's in Maharashtra
nor in Delhi.

1543
02:09:21,988 --> 02:09:24,149
Do you suspect he's still here?

1544
02:09:24,357 --> 02:09:26,450
He's not so brave.

1545
02:09:28,027 --> 02:09:32,521
He's also as strong in getting
into the cabinet as l'm.

1546
02:09:32,732 --> 02:09:36,224
lf he get holds of her,
he'll play with my life.

1547
02:09:45,278 --> 02:09:46,609
Nobody is here.

1548
02:09:48,381 --> 02:09:51,509
l don't know whether you got it or not,
l did get one thing clearly.

1549
02:09:51,717 --> 02:09:52,342
What is it?

1550
02:09:52,552 --> 02:09:55,715
There's another man Shinde
who is also after Meenu.

1551
02:09:56,656 --> 02:09:58,590
ls it necessary to investigate now?

1552
02:09:58,958 --> 02:10:02,519
Leave this place immediately
with Meenu.

1553
02:10:23,482 --> 02:10:26,747
Don't tell that l'm not wearing brief.

1554
02:10:27,353 --> 02:10:28,752
lt is looking there only.

1555
02:10:35,428 --> 02:10:38,397
Who is it?
- What happened, brother-in-law?

1556
02:10:38,598 --> 02:10:41,066
What was that sound?
- Sound? l didn't hear anything.

1557
02:10:41,267 --> 02:10:42,495
Are you all drunk?

1558
02:10:43,102 --> 02:10:45,662
We had a drink to celebrate
your daughter's marriage.

1559
02:10:46,038 --> 02:10:50,099
Okay, go and check.
- Come on boys.

1560
02:10:50,309 --> 02:10:52,004
Looks like it's our dog.

1561
02:10:52,211 --> 02:10:54,008
May be feeling cold
to cover with blanket.

1562
02:10:54,213 --> 02:10:56,647
How can it cover itself with blanket?
Somebody may have entered.

1563
02:10:57,016 --> 02:10:59,678
lt's better to leave this place now.

1564
02:11:00,553 --> 02:11:02,077
Has he left already?

1565
02:11:08,461 --> 02:11:09,655
Where is he?

1566
02:11:11,964 --> 02:11:13,090
Where is he?

1567
02:11:26,545 --> 02:11:29,309
ls anyone there?
Who is it?

1568
02:11:31,384 --> 02:11:32,282
Where is he?
l'll call him on phone.

1569
02:11:52,304 --> 02:11:55,171
Nobody is here.
- Did you search properly?

1570
02:12:54,433 --> 02:12:57,061
He's my friend, he's with me.

1571
02:13:05,311 --> 02:13:09,509
l gave you 48 hours time
but you came earlier.

1572
02:13:10,216 --> 02:13:12,275
You're very fast.

1573
02:13:13,953 --> 02:13:18,253
l'm fire...

1574
02:13:18,457 --> 02:13:21,585
You're tender bud...

1575
02:13:23,329 --> 02:13:28,596
Tender bud...
why did you dare to love me?

1576
02:13:33,672 --> 02:13:35,936
What a figure!

1577
02:13:36,075 --> 02:13:38,600
Clusters of stars in the sky...

1578
02:13:38,978 --> 02:13:41,310
Bunches of raw grape seeds...

1579
02:13:41,514 --> 02:13:46,679
Veil...veil...

1580
02:13:48,053 --> 02:13:49,384
Why are you leaving without
informing me?

1581
02:13:49,588 --> 02:13:52,148
Your father-in-law will have me
with his whisky.

1582
02:13:55,594 --> 02:13:58,222
Daddy, a wish.
- Tell me.

1583
02:13:58,430 --> 02:14:03,390
Your son-in-law mustnit go out
till marriage.- Okay dear.

1584
02:14:04,136 --> 02:14:08,266
One who falls needn't always
be the bad guy...

1585
02:14:08,607 --> 02:14:10,598
l can escape if l get drunk.

1586
02:14:12,278 --> 02:14:19,684
Have a ball, drunkard...

1587
02:14:20,052 --> 02:14:24,614
l'm king and you're my queen...

1588
02:14:24,990 --> 02:14:28,255
But this love is not old...

1589
02:14:28,394 --> 02:14:29,725
Do l've time to pack up?

1590
02:14:47,947 --> 02:14:49,938
My life is yours...

1591
02:14:50,149 --> 02:14:53,141
Your life is mine...

1592
02:14:53,352 --> 02:14:56,048
Watch the spectacle of heart...

1593
02:15:02,228 --> 02:15:06,562
l'll come like Baghdad thief for you...

1594
02:15:07,032 --> 02:15:11,435
l'll steal your beauty and youth...

1595
02:15:11,637 --> 02:15:16,233
l'll take -ray of you with my eyes...

1596
02:15:16,609 --> 02:15:21,069
l'll do all that l saved with you...

1597
02:15:21,513 --> 02:15:23,913
What do l've saved from you...

1598
02:15:24,116 --> 02:15:26,175
Whatever it is,
it is right before you...

1599
02:15:26,385 --> 02:15:30,583
Devour my beauty gently...

1600
02:16:09,428 --> 02:16:11,396
lntoxicating eyes...

1601
02:16:11,597 --> 02:16:13,963
Nerves are on rocks...

1602
02:16:14,166 --> 02:16:16,100
My heart is thumping...

1603
02:16:16,302 --> 02:16:18,497
How?

1604
02:16:19,071 --> 02:16:23,440
Commit the sin in the chilly nights...

1605
02:16:23,642 --> 02:16:28,443
l'll hide you in me...like this...

1606
02:16:28,647 --> 02:16:33,277
Love has lit fire to
my ice cold heart...

1607
02:16:33,485 --> 02:16:37,979
My body is charged up and
douse it falling on me like rain...

1608
02:16:38,190 --> 02:16:40,420
The moon is right before you...

1609
02:16:40,626 --> 02:16:42,924
Dare and it's all yours...

1610
02:16:43,128 --> 02:16:48,031
Fight your way to bliss...

1611
02:17:21,433 --> 02:17:23,424
Your words are elating...

1612
02:17:23,635 --> 02:17:25,899
Majestic in your walk...

1613
02:17:26,105 --> 02:17:30,405
l'm going bonkers...

1614
02:17:31,043 --> 02:17:33,068
l'm stuck in your eyes...

1615
02:17:33,278 --> 02:17:35,473
You're hot lava inside a volcano...

1616
02:17:35,681 --> 02:17:40,448
The stork will arrive in
few months from now...

1617
02:17:40,652 --> 02:17:45,282
You're the silver cloud...
l'm the hot wind...

1618
02:17:45,491 --> 02:17:50,121
l'm rushing to hit you,
watch out...

1619
02:17:50,329 --> 02:17:52,490
Did l say no to your overtures?

1620
02:17:52,698 --> 02:17:54,962
Did l say no to touch me?

1621
02:17:55,167 --> 02:17:59,604
lf you dare kiss me,
won't l accept it happily?

1622
02:18:47,953 --> 02:18:50,080
Why are you standing here?

1623
02:18:50,289 --> 02:18:52,120
Waiting for him?

1624
02:18:52,324 --> 02:18:57,091
He'll come, you've dinner.
Come in dear...come.

1625
02:19:02,601 --> 02:19:04,432
Phone is ringing, get up.

1626
02:19:05,104 --> 02:19:07,595
l'm also getting the same dream.

1627
02:19:08,040 --> 02:19:09,371
Bloody bull!

1628
02:19:32,030 --> 02:19:33,520
Where are you?

1629
02:19:33,732 --> 02:19:36,064
l waited for you all the night.

1630
02:19:37,369 --> 02:19:38,563
Why don't you talk to me?

1631
02:19:39,938 --> 02:19:42,429
Who is it? My brother-in-law?
Give the phone to me.

1632
02:19:42,641 --> 02:19:45,474
What you're doing isn't good?

1633
02:19:45,677 --> 02:19:48,578
You could be irresponsible earlier,

1634
02:19:48,947 --> 02:19:50,175
your lover is at home,

1635
02:19:50,382 --> 02:19:53,180
marriage is almost fixed,
how could you roam irresponsibly?

1636
02:19:53,385 --> 02:19:55,250
Come home immediately.

1637
02:20:13,071 --> 02:20:18,941
Stop....stop...- What happened?
- Tell me what happened?

1638
02:20:20,445 --> 02:20:22,743
He cheated me.

1639
02:20:27,586 --> 02:20:29,144
She's calling again.

1640
02:20:29,354 --> 02:20:31,447
Who?
- She's calling him again.

1641
02:20:40,632 --> 02:20:42,691
He loves Meenu.

1642
02:20:48,140 --> 02:20:50,040
He must die not you my dear.

1643
02:20:50,242 --> 02:20:51,709
Brother-in-law.
- Yes.

1644
02:20:52,077 --> 02:20:55,205
l fixed the marriage as
my daughter wished.

1645
02:20:55,414 --> 02:21:00,442
lf romances another girl,
l'll not spare him alive.

1646
02:21:00,652 --> 02:21:04,247
l'll kill him.
- Do you know who she is?

1647
02:21:06,058 --> 02:21:07,423
Did you see them anywhere?

1648
02:21:09,261 --> 02:21:11,092
Your first wife's daughter.

1649
02:21:13,332 --> 02:21:18,269
Not only to you becoming a Minister,
she's a hurdle to your daughter's love also.

1650
02:21:18,670 --> 02:21:21,730
Before Shinde gets her...
- Enough !

1651
02:21:23,375 --> 02:21:27,744
To widen the road
they cut down huge trees also,

1652
02:21:28,247 --> 02:21:31,045
in the cabinet expansion, if anyone
becomes hurdle to my berth,

1653
02:21:31,250 --> 02:21:34,742
l'll kill if it's my daughter also.
- No...no please...

1654
02:21:38,290 --> 02:21:41,885
We didn't see anything.
We didn't hear anything.

1655
02:21:42,094 --> 02:21:43,391
He too didn't hear anything.

1656
02:21:43,595 --> 02:21:45,392
Way to my home is this side, right?

1657
02:21:47,366 --> 02:21:50,301
Come, this is short cut.
He's very hesitant.

1658
02:21:50,502 --> 02:21:52,436
Party was excellent.

1659
02:21:52,638 --> 02:21:54,572
Let's meet on the marriage day.

1660
02:21:56,308 --> 02:22:00,267
Please don't kill him.
l'll tell everything you want.

1661
02:22:04,516 --> 02:22:08,452
Girl, l'm Meenu's aunt.
Can you please call her out?

1662
02:22:09,655 --> 02:22:12,556
Why are you staring?
Please call her out.

1663
02:22:12,758 --> 02:22:14,282
Don't you know about Meenu?

1664
02:22:14,493 --> 02:22:16,324
What happened?
What happened to my Meenu?

1665
02:22:16,528 --> 02:22:18,519
What happened to my sweet darling?

1666
02:22:24,569 --> 02:22:28,096
Where is she?
- Turn your face to right.

1667
02:22:32,077 --> 02:22:33,203
Why are you showing me Buddha's statue?

1668
02:22:33,412 --> 02:22:37,576
You're brandishing gun for everything,
to put some sense of peace in you.

1669
02:22:40,619 --> 02:22:42,917
Thank God, you gave a good news.

1670
02:22:43,121 --> 02:22:45,089
Yes aunt, she's safe in Krish's house.

1671
02:22:45,290 --> 02:22:48,555
She called us also.
- Okay...okay...

1672
02:22:50,262 --> 02:22:55,063
You said she called you,
did she gave any address?

1673
02:22:55,267 --> 02:22:56,598
Wait, l'll get it.

1674
02:22:58,970 --> 02:23:02,098
What will you do if you find the girl?

1675
02:23:02,307 --> 02:23:05,242
l'll take her to Delhi and
parade her before media.

1676
02:23:05,444 --> 02:23:06,968
l'll make her say he's her father.

1677
02:23:07,179 --> 02:23:10,080
What if she refuses to go
against her father?

1678
02:23:10,482 --> 02:23:12,040
l'll kill her.

1679
02:23:12,184 --> 02:23:16,587
l'll have the DNA tests done on bodies
and prove she's his daughter.

1680
02:23:18,190 --> 02:23:18,952
Tell me.

1681
02:23:19,157 --> 02:23:21,318
He'll not tell.

1682
02:23:21,526 --> 02:23:23,426
How can he be lover if he reveals,

1683
02:23:23,628 --> 02:23:26,062
how can l be friend if l reveal.

1684
02:23:26,365 --> 02:23:30,597
How can l be a factionist
if l don't get truth from you?

1685
02:23:40,645 --> 02:23:42,670
l'll tell!
l'll tell you !

1686
02:23:43,315 --> 02:23:45,044
Go, get her.

1687
02:23:45,951 --> 02:23:49,682
Who are you guys?
What are you doing?

1688
02:23:55,427 --> 02:23:57,327
Nobody is here.

1689
02:23:59,965 --> 02:24:01,933
Where is the girl?
- Who? Your daughter?

1690
02:24:02,134 --> 02:24:03,431
She's not here, they took her away.

1691
02:24:03,635 --> 02:24:06,399
Who took her?

1692
02:24:08,473 --> 02:24:13,467
What's this? Her friends came
saying you asked to bring her.

1693
02:24:13,678 --> 02:24:14,406
Friend?

1694
02:24:14,613 --> 02:24:16,706
The girl said like that only.

1695
02:24:34,566 --> 02:24:35,430
Get down !

1696
02:24:36,468 --> 02:24:37,526
Get down !

1697
02:24:44,509 --> 02:24:46,033
Krish is not here.

1698
02:24:48,346 --> 02:24:49,540
Where is he?

1699
02:24:53,151 --> 02:24:55,676
Call him here.

1700
02:24:56,521 --> 02:25:00,890
Call her...you know where she is.

1701
02:25:01,092 --> 02:25:02,320
Trust me, l don't know.

1702
02:25:02,527 --> 02:25:03,653
Call her.

1703
02:25:12,003 --> 02:25:14,563
lt's me Meenu.

1704
02:25:18,276 --> 02:25:19,402
Can you hear me?

1705
02:25:25,350 --> 02:25:28,319
l'm Meenu, l'm beside
a temple near airport.

1706
02:25:28,520 --> 02:25:29,714
Come immediately.

1707
02:25:33,959 --> 02:25:35,358
Take him away and kill him.

1708
02:25:39,397 --> 02:25:40,523
Follow them!

1709
02:25:40,899 --> 02:25:43,663
Your game is very interesting,
l want see closely.

1710
02:25:44,035 --> 02:25:45,525
l'll also come with you.
- Get lost man !

1711
02:25:50,675 --> 02:25:54,543
l expected this reaction from you.

1712
02:25:54,913 --> 02:25:57,677
l mustn't be here,
he may come back for me.

1713
02:26:03,688 --> 02:26:07,249
Let's play a game
before Krish comes here.

1714
02:26:10,562 --> 02:26:14,225
This bullet is gun's partner,

1715
02:26:14,633 --> 02:26:17,067
it'll take only one life,

1716
02:26:17,636 --> 02:26:21,094
it'll keep only one of us alive
by the time Krish is here.

1717
02:26:21,306 --> 02:26:26,710
Why are you doing this?
- We both want Krish.

1718
02:26:28,179 --> 02:26:33,276
When two people fight for one thing,
game will decide the loser.

1719
02:26:58,376 --> 02:27:00,139
Please Manju...no...

1720
02:27:21,032 --> 02:27:22,158
Are you scared?

1721
02:27:23,168 --> 02:27:27,070
Leave Krish to me, l'll spare you.
Okay?

1722
02:28:04,643 --> 02:28:06,736
Bullet is waiting for me.

1723
02:28:12,651 --> 02:28:16,382
You get Krish...
Krish is all yours...

1724
02:28:16,688 --> 02:28:17,746
No!

1725
02:28:23,728 --> 02:28:27,459
l played this game without bullet
which you don't know,

1726
02:28:28,033 --> 02:28:32,129
but two MP's are playing with
your life the same game,

1727
02:28:32,370 --> 02:28:33,769
one of them is my father.

1728
02:28:34,472 --> 02:28:37,270
He's your father too.

1729
02:28:41,046 --> 02:28:42,707
Who do you think she is?

1730
02:28:43,648 --> 02:28:45,411
Your first wife's daughter.

1731
02:28:46,718 --> 02:28:51,712
l'll kill my daughter also if she becomes
a hurdle to my Ministerial aspirations.

1732
02:28:54,459 --> 02:28:58,418
The pity you've on my life,
your father doesn't have it for your life.

1733
02:28:59,330 --> 02:29:02,731
When Krish comes,
you both go away from here.

1734
02:29:13,411 --> 02:29:14,378
Stop!

1735
02:29:23,154 --> 02:29:26,954
Do you want daughter or cabinet berth?

1736
02:29:28,026 --> 02:29:29,391
What are you thinking?

1737
02:29:30,228 --> 02:29:31,354
Answer me quickly.

1738
02:29:39,204 --> 02:29:41,468
What is it?
- Municipal vehicles for fumigation.

1739
02:29:41,673 --> 02:29:43,538
Don't you know this too?
- Shut up!

1740
02:30:10,568 --> 02:30:13,196
Go boys!
- Okay boss.

1741
02:30:24,249 --> 02:30:25,273
Where is he?

1742
02:32:02,480 --> 02:32:04,710
You need power in the punch
not just personality.

1743
02:32:14,225 --> 02:32:16,523
Don't get afraid, l'll not harm you.

1744
02:32:19,998 --> 02:32:21,727
Look, your daughter.

1745
02:32:25,970 --> 02:32:27,995
Kill her!
That was your plan, right?

1746
02:32:28,206 --> 02:32:29,605
You must become a Minister, right?

1747
02:32:30,508 --> 02:32:32,703
Seconds thoughts will not let you kill,
so don't think, just kill.

1748
02:32:33,077 --> 02:32:37,980
Terrorists who kill innocents
coming from nowhere,

1749
02:32:38,182 --> 02:32:43,051
what do they call fathers like you who
kill for position their own progeny?

1750
02:32:44,255 --> 02:32:47,520
lf killing is fun to you,
then kill me also.

1751
02:32:47,725 --> 02:32:49,420
The more you kill the
more famous you'll be,

1752
02:32:49,627 --> 02:32:54,064
you'll get national awards
for killing.

1753
02:32:54,632 --> 02:32:59,262
Daddy, kill me also if it can
get you bigger position.

1754
02:33:16,554 --> 02:33:18,920
My mother stayed away
from your life.

1755
02:33:19,157 --> 02:33:21,250
l'll also not become hurdle to you.

1756
02:33:21,492 --> 02:33:22,925
Please kill me, father.

1757
02:33:30,468 --> 02:33:33,266
Get up...get up!

1758
02:33:35,673 --> 02:33:39,165
A simple question,
you want life or cabinet berth?

1759
02:33:39,377 --> 02:33:41,868
Cabinet berth !
- You're real politician.

1760
02:33:42,080 --> 02:33:43,206
Take it.

1761
02:33:47,018 --> 02:33:50,044
l don't want position or power.

1762
02:33:50,621 --> 02:33:52,316
l want my family.

1763
02:33:55,293 --> 02:33:56,658
l want my daughter.

1764
02:34:12,210 --> 02:34:16,374
l, Shivaji Shinde,
do swear in the name of God,

1765
02:34:16,581 --> 02:34:22,417
that l will bear true faith and allegiance to
the Constitution of lndia as by law established...
