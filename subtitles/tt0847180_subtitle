1
00:00:05,405 --> 00:00:09,838
Rip By Senseman

2
00:00:55,405 --> 00:00:56,838
Hey.
- Be careful.

3
00:00:56,906 --> 00:01:00,501
What the... That hurt...

4
00:01:00,777 --> 00:01:01,869
Can't you see?

5
00:01:01,945 --> 00:01:04,470
How can I see, it's so dark
around here I can't see anything.

6
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:09,342
Shall I give the torch?
- No, sing a song.

7
00:01:11,287 --> 00:01:12,879
You can see yet you are asking me.

8
00:01:12,956 --> 00:01:15,424
It's so dark here, I
cannot see anything.

9
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:17,392
Where are you looking?

10
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,291
Why don't you switch on the torch.

11
00:01:19,362 --> 00:01:23,298
It's an imported one, made in
China sold in Chandni Chowk.

12
00:01:23,366 --> 00:01:26,301
Its okay, there
was no battery in it.

13
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:28,837
Battery? But the list had
only torch written in it.

14
00:01:28,905 --> 00:01:30,896
You are so smart.

15
00:01:30,974 --> 00:01:33,101
I asked you to bring the
car and you forgot the tire.

16
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:35,303
I hope you didn't
forget the lighter?

17
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:41,314
I wish I had some more spotlight then
I could have become Hrithik Roshan.

18
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:42,875
...and had a blast.

19
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:44,313
We are here to steal...

20
00:01:44,387 --> 00:01:46,787
...and not get caught for
a sex scandal or murder.

21
00:02:10,513 --> 00:02:12,310
Is this a horse or a donkey?

22
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:13,906
Looks like a horse but
the body looks like of a...

23
00:02:13,983 --> 00:02:17,510
People are paying millions
for this painting. - Yes.

24
00:02:17,987 --> 00:02:19,113
What do we care?

25
00:02:19,189 --> 00:02:20,247
We are getting paid.

26
00:02:20,323 --> 00:02:21,881
Hold it.
- Yes.

27
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:25,394
Pick up the lighter.
- Yes.

28
00:02:26,262 --> 00:02:28,230
What the... What happened?

29
00:02:28,298 --> 00:02:29,390
It was hot.

30
00:02:29,465 --> 00:02:31,456
You must have held
it near the flame.

31
00:02:33,136 --> 00:02:34,364
Fire.

32
00:02:35,138 --> 00:02:36,196
Don't let it catch fire.

33
00:02:36,272 --> 00:02:37,899
Extinguish it.
- Yes,

34
00:02:51,387 --> 00:02:52,877
It caught fire again.

35
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:09,931
What is this?

36
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:12,297
What is this?
- What is this?

37
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:14,172
This is the painting.

38
00:03:15,078 --> 00:03:16,306
There is no need to worry.

39
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:18,006
At least the horse is safe, look.

40
00:03:19,048 --> 00:03:21,243
How, what and why should I tell you?

41
00:03:21,551 --> 00:03:24,952
You have done a great
favor by saving this horse.

42
00:03:25,488 --> 00:03:27,217
Now spare him.

43
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,986
And save your name.

44
00:03:30,193 --> 00:03:31,353
Save your honor.

45
00:03:31,527 --> 00:03:32,824
Forget the horse.

46
00:03:32,862 --> 00:03:34,830
And let's get out before
the family members come out.

47
00:03:34,898 --> 00:03:35,956
Come on.

48
00:03:36,032 --> 00:03:37,863
We are in trouble.

49
00:03:40,336 --> 00:03:41,928
Who is it?

50
00:03:42,338 --> 00:03:43,566
Who is it?

51
00:03:44,274 --> 00:03:45,866
Hands up.

52
00:03:45,942 --> 00:03:47,910
Put your hands up.

53
00:03:48,845 --> 00:03:50,745
Don't play with guns at this age.

54
00:03:51,514 --> 00:03:53,141
You rascals. I fell down.

55
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:55,810
I fell down.

56
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:01,354
Run.

57
00:04:12,235 --> 00:04:13,862
This is Pandit.

58
00:04:14,237 --> 00:04:16,398
'He isn't just Pandit by
name... but also by deed.'

59
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,239
'Whoever dares to cross his path... '

60
00:04:19,309 --> 00:04:21,777
'... his plight becomes unbearable.'

61
00:04:22,912 --> 00:04:24,971
And he is Akbar.

62
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:27,983
A resident of Mohammad Ali Road
in Mumbai.

63
00:04:28,284 --> 00:04:30,149
Pandit is an expert with words...

64
00:04:30,219 --> 00:04:31,516
...and he is an expert
in breaking locks.

65
00:04:31,788 --> 00:04:33,050
Old man.

66
00:04:33,122 --> 00:04:38,424
This is the age to eat pills
and not shoot bullets.

67
00:04:38,995 --> 00:04:40,963
Free advice.
- Let's go.

68
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:17,358
"Terminate all."

69
00:06:54,764 --> 00:06:55,890
Who?

70
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,028
Send them in.

71
00:07:05,108 --> 00:07:06,166
Pandit's here.

72
00:07:16,385 --> 00:07:18,148
Think.

73
00:07:18,221 --> 00:07:20,212
Think what excuse
you will give this time. Think.

74
00:07:20,289 --> 00:07:22,154
It's not about making excuses, boss.

75
00:07:22,792 --> 00:07:24,919
We made a mistake.
- Mistake?

76
00:07:26,229 --> 00:07:29,790
No, no, no, it was my mistake
that I gave you two a job.

77
00:07:30,066 --> 00:07:32,091
You ruined everything like always.

78
00:07:32,401 --> 00:07:35,802
Have you two done any job
without making a mistake?

79
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,931
You are getting angry as if...

80
00:07:38,007 --> 00:07:42,307
...your picture got burnt.
- It was Hussain's painting.

81
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:43,436
We will get another one.

82
00:07:43,513 --> 00:07:46,073
Hussain.

83
00:07:47,283 --> 00:07:49,444
Is he your uncle?
- Who said so?

84
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:50,981
You did.

85
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:56,256
He is such a big artist
so we should respect him.

86
00:07:56,325 --> 00:07:59,192
The ones who gave us the advance...

87
00:07:59,428 --> 00:08:02,864
...want M.F. Hussain's painting
and not respect.

88
00:08:04,133 --> 00:08:05,828
Forget that.

89
00:08:08,971 --> 00:08:10,165
Take a look at this.

90
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,067
This is Mr. Johnson.

91
00:08:12,141 --> 00:08:14,507
He is a big party from Pattaya.
- What Pattaya?

92
00:08:15,945 --> 00:08:20,143
Pattaya is close to Bangkok, abroad.

93
00:08:21,484 --> 00:08:23,042
The old man lives alone.

94
00:08:24,187 --> 00:08:26,917
I have heard that there is
jewelry worth millions in his safe.

95
00:08:27,823 --> 00:08:29,450
You two get that.

96
00:08:30,459 --> 00:08:33,189
I have a contact there,
he will help you two.

97
00:08:34,063 --> 00:08:36,327
If you two make a mistake
in this job...

98
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:39,896
...then you're gone for good.

99
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:43,929
But if you do the job properly
and get these jewelry back...

100
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:48,274
...then you two won't
have to work again.

101
00:08:48,411 --> 00:08:50,709
Then we won't work.
- What?

102
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:54,045
I mean once we do this job,
then that's the end.

103
00:08:55,218 --> 00:08:57,277
Yes, it's done.
- Its done.

104
00:08:57,353 --> 00:09:00,481
Don't take a chance with them.

105
00:09:00,756 --> 00:09:02,348
Are we girls that
he'll take a chance on us.

106
00:09:02,425 --> 00:09:04,416
Are we standing in the market
and calling out to you?

107
00:09:04,493 --> 00:09:06,256
Goodbye, boss. Send us a message.

108
00:09:06,329 --> 00:09:07,921
We will talk later.
- Leave. Please.

109
00:09:07,997 --> 00:09:09,487
And anyway we don't waste
our times with men. - Please.

110
00:09:09,732 --> 00:09:11,256
Goodbye.

111
00:09:13,336 --> 00:09:17,067
Builder. Do you know
anyone who has been abroad?

112
00:09:17,907 --> 00:09:19,306
There is one boy.

113
00:09:19,342 --> 00:09:21,105
Did you eat or not?

114
00:09:21,177 --> 00:09:22,405
Work faster.

115
00:09:28,784 --> 00:09:32,379
Work faster.

116
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:42,424
Here.

117
00:09:44,267 --> 00:09:46,235
What's this? So less.

118
00:09:46,302 --> 00:09:49,760
So?
- This is a motorcycle, not a cycle.

119
00:09:49,939 --> 00:09:51,133
Do you understand?

120
00:09:51,207 --> 00:09:52,435
Or should I take it back?

121
00:09:53,376 --> 00:09:58,109
Wilson, you are very short-tempered.

122
00:09:58,814 --> 00:10:00,782
Take this. That's enough.

123
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,215
Who will buy the engine?

124
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:04,452
Look, boy.

125
00:10:05,054 --> 00:10:08,182
That's the final offer.

126
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:11,290
It's absolutely right.

127
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,289
Now scurry out of here.

128
00:10:13,796 --> 00:10:15,093
God bless you.

129
00:10:17,566 --> 00:10:19,557
Builder. You?

130
00:10:20,503 --> 00:10:21,993
You will live for a 100 years.

131
00:10:22,238 --> 00:10:23,899
I was just thinking about you.

132
00:10:23,939 --> 00:10:25,804
I know, I know, I know.

133
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:30,141
MH 04 DQ 6197.

134
00:10:31,013 --> 00:10:33,413
He had gone to pray in the church.
- Who?

135
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:37,052
You?
- Inspector D'souza.

136
00:10:39,255 --> 00:10:40,415
This bike?

137
00:10:42,091 --> 00:10:44,059
I... I didn't know.

138
00:10:44,126 --> 00:10:45,855
I am so sorry.

139
00:10:46,162 --> 00:10:47,891
'This is Wilson.

140
00:10:47,963 --> 00:10:50,227
'He could've been the biggest con
in the world.'

141
00:10:50,466 --> 00:10:54,197
'But girls diverted his attention.'

142
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,936
What's the point in telling me?

143
00:10:57,273 --> 00:10:59,969
And anyway,
when D'souza locks you up...

144
00:11:00,009 --> 00:11:02,876
...he will make you wear
your underwear above your pant.

145
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:06,180
Then you will turn into Superman.

146
00:11:06,782 --> 00:11:08,807
What do you want?
- Will you come to Pattaya?

147
00:11:12,021 --> 00:11:14,216
You want a fake passport.
- No.

148
00:11:15,558 --> 00:11:16,820
No.

149
00:11:16,892 --> 00:11:18,325
Then go ahead.

150
00:11:18,394 --> 00:11:19,884
You come along.

151
00:11:20,796 --> 00:11:23,264
Look, I have stopped
doing these jobs.

152
00:11:23,566 --> 00:11:26,160
I am absolutely clean now.

153
00:11:26,235 --> 00:11:28,135
Like ultra-surf.
- I see.

154
00:11:28,204 --> 00:11:30,001
That means first
I will have to clean you up.

155
00:11:32,408 --> 00:11:33,466
And then you will come along.

156
00:11:33,542 --> 00:11:35,066
'He is Builder.'

157
00:11:35,144 --> 00:11:37,578
'He was Mr. Maharashtra in 1994.'

158
00:11:37,847 --> 00:11:40,077
'He received a medal but no money.'

159
00:11:40,249 --> 00:11:43,184
'Now he works for
Batliwala as a cleaning agent... '

160
00:11:43,252 --> 00:11:45,447
'... meaning muscles
for hire for money.'

161
00:11:49,992 --> 00:11:52,256
Tomorrow morning, 10 o'clock.

162
00:11:52,328 --> 00:11:54,193
Batliwala's office.

163
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,127
You look like an innocent thief.

164
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,231
What do you do?

165
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:03,999
The same thing... that you two do.

166
00:12:04,073 --> 00:12:05,506
Oh, you sweep as well.

167
00:12:05,775 --> 00:12:06,935
What?

168
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:08,799
You two sweep the place.

169
00:12:08,878 --> 00:12:10,106
Of course.

170
00:12:10,179 --> 00:12:11,305
In others house.

171
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,870
When everyone's
asleep in their house...

172
00:12:12,948 --> 00:12:14,381
...we go and sweep the place clean...

173
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:16,315
...and come back
and sleep in our house.

174
00:12:16,385 --> 00:12:19,252
You will be bored to death hearing
Tom and Jerry's conversation.

175
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:20,845
This is Wilson.

176
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:24,391
Wilson from Bandra.

177
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,553
Who cares if you are from Bandra?

178
00:12:26,962 --> 00:12:28,896
Are the three of us going?

179
00:12:28,931 --> 00:12:31,832
Not three, four.

180
00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:35,794
It's a game of millions,
I don't want to take a risk.

181
00:12:36,972 --> 00:12:40,408
Builder will go along
with you three.

182
00:12:41,577 --> 00:12:42,908
Perfect.

183
00:12:43,446 --> 00:12:45,880
I need someone to carry the luggage.

184
00:12:47,283 --> 00:12:48,443
Porter.

185
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,146
Porter.

186
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,326
How much money did you borrow?

187
00:14:10,533 --> 00:14:11,830
Five lakhs,

188
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:14,265
When were you supposed
to return it? - Last week.

189
00:14:16,005 --> 00:14:18,166
Break both his legs.
- But I...

190
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,332
Quiet.

191
00:14:19,842 --> 00:14:21,332
Did I ask you to start a business?

192
00:14:22,244 --> 00:14:23,541
And what business did you do?

193
00:14:23,812 --> 00:14:25,074
Massage parlor.

194
00:14:26,315 --> 00:14:28,909
Where you drink beer all day
and get a massage.

195
00:14:28,984 --> 00:14:31,452
I have stopped drinking
beer from today. - Quiet.

196
00:14:33,522 --> 00:14:35,820
What did I say
when you brought the proposal?

197
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,422
Razaq, what had I said?

198
00:14:37,493 --> 00:14:38,983
You had refused.

199
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:42,093
But I am your brother.

200
00:14:42,164 --> 00:14:43,426
When my kin can betray me then...

201
00:14:43,499 --> 00:14:45,057
...why will the others respect me?

202
00:14:46,168 --> 00:14:48,728
I have committed a lot of
bloodshed to reach here.

203
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:52,030
Forget it. Break his hand.

204
00:14:54,276 --> 00:14:57,211
Ask him which hand.

205
00:14:57,379 --> 00:14:59,370
Left...
- Or right?

206
00:15:00,015 --> 00:15:02,916
No!

207
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:13,155
I am tired of sitting here.

208
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:15,520
I really have to go.

209
00:15:15,798 --> 00:15:17,322
Where should I go?

210
00:15:18,067 --> 00:15:19,796
This place looks proper.

211
00:15:21,437 --> 00:15:22,529
No!

212
00:15:22,771 --> 00:15:25,069
What are you doing?
We are not in India.

213
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,232
I know we are not.

214
00:15:26,308 --> 00:15:27,502
So will I not pee?

215
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:29,439
They haven't built a public toilet.

216
00:15:31,213 --> 00:15:32,942
No one's watching. Shall I do it?

217
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,175
Control.

218
00:15:39,254 --> 00:15:40,551
Indians.

219
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:42,819
I will be right back.

220
00:15:49,932 --> 00:15:51,024
Hello.

221
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,265
Is she Indian too?

222
00:15:53,335 --> 00:15:55,394
What is it?
- Its day.

223
00:15:55,471 --> 00:15:56,733
It will be night soon.

224
00:15:56,805 --> 00:15:57,863
Let's talk.

225
00:15:57,906 --> 00:15:58,930
Did you find out
where they are from?

226
00:15:59,008 --> 00:15:59,872
What?

227
00:15:59,942 --> 00:16:02,809
Did you find out
where they are from?

228
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:04,243
I have found some locals.

229
00:16:04,313 --> 00:16:05,871
They will guide us.

230
00:16:06,315 --> 00:16:07,407
My good name Akbar.

231
00:16:07,483 --> 00:16:09,781
Pandit, Builder, Wilson.

232
00:16:10,352 --> 00:16:11,216
Your good name, please.

233
00:16:11,286 --> 00:16:12,310
I am Virus.

234
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:13,446
Virender Yuvraaj Singh.

235
00:16:13,522 --> 00:16:14,784
Hello.

236
00:16:14,857 --> 00:16:16,119
And I am SMS.

237
00:16:16,191 --> 00:16:17,385
Sharmilee Sequeira.

238
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:19,017
What do I say? How do I say?

239
00:16:19,094 --> 00:16:21,153
And why should I say?

240
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,891
That we are looking for an address.

241
00:16:22,965 --> 00:16:24,227
You have arrived at the right place?

242
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,125
Come on, shell out the goods.

243
00:16:27,202 --> 00:16:28,134
What is this?

244
00:16:28,203 --> 00:16:29,500
You are plundering Indians.

245
00:16:29,772 --> 00:16:32,798
I am no longer an Indian.

246
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:34,843
Like I said, out with the goods.

247
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,935
We asked to show us the address
and not the knife.

248
00:16:37,012 --> 00:16:38,206
Even we asked you to
shell out your purse...

249
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,110
...and not act smart.

250
00:16:39,181 --> 00:16:40,273
Fool.

251
00:16:40,983 --> 00:16:43,076
We act smart only with smart people.

252
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:45,979
We just have to be a little
careful with people like you.

253
00:16:46,488 --> 00:16:47,853
Did you understand?

254
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:51,958
You are trying
to plunder the wrong man.

255
00:16:52,027 --> 00:16:53,255
Do you want me to stab you?

256
00:16:54,363 --> 00:16:56,854
You don't ask before stabbing?

257
00:16:57,366 --> 00:17:00,426
And you don't stab without asking.

258
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:05,930
Throw down your knife
and your intentions.

259
00:17:06,008 --> 00:17:08,272
Otherwise we will be helpless...

260
00:17:09,344 --> 00:17:12,040
...and this matter
will get out of control.

261
00:17:12,081 --> 00:17:13,343
Try to understand.

262
00:17:13,415 --> 00:17:14,939
I am just explaining.

263
00:17:14,983 --> 00:17:16,143
But he will explain to you.

264
00:17:16,218 --> 00:17:18,118
Hey, tall guy.

265
00:17:18,187 --> 00:17:19,347
Shell out the goods.

266
00:17:19,755 --> 00:17:20,449
Okay, okay.

267
00:17:20,522 --> 00:17:22,080
What are you looking at?

268
00:17:26,328 --> 00:17:29,491
Britannia 50-50. Get lost.
- We will deal with you later.

269
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,028
I won't spare you.
- We won't.

270
00:17:32,101 --> 00:17:33,864
We will deal with you later.

271
00:17:33,936 --> 00:17:35,369
You have seen the gun.

272
00:17:35,404 --> 00:17:37,099
Shall we show the hand bomb as well?

273
00:17:37,773 --> 00:17:42,301
Wow, did you bring this gun
from India in your bag?

274
00:17:42,377 --> 00:17:47,076
No, I brought this gun
from India in your bag.

275
00:17:47,349 --> 00:17:48,907
Coolie. Coolie.

276
00:17:50,385 --> 00:17:52,319
He fooled you.

277
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:12,939
Yes, how can I help you?

278
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:15,238
Batliwala has sent us.

279
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:18,210
Oh, I was expecting you all.

280
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:19,973
Tanya.

281
00:18:20,315 --> 00:18:22,977
Builder. And he is...
- Pandit.

282
00:18:23,051 --> 00:18:24,177
Myself Akbar.

283
00:18:24,453 --> 00:18:26,318
Above all, Wilson.

284
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:31,885
Tanya, what a beautiful name.
- Thank you.

285
00:18:32,795 --> 00:18:33,887
Come on in.

286
00:18:36,165 --> 00:18:37,325
My hand.

287
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:40,058
Sorry.

288
00:18:40,135 --> 00:18:41,227
That's okay.

289
00:18:43,972 --> 00:18:47,237
I hope you didn't have any
problem in finding the house.

290
00:18:47,309 --> 00:18:49,106
We can never run into trouble.

291
00:18:49,178 --> 00:18:51,806
People land in trouble due to us.

292
00:18:52,114 --> 00:18:55,481
So, Wilson...
- By the way, where is that?

293
00:18:56,084 --> 00:18:57,483
What?
- I have to go.

294
00:18:57,753 --> 00:18:58,879
I am sorry.

295
00:18:58,954 --> 00:19:00,148
Straight and left. Be comfortable.

296
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:01,314
Thank you.

297
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:03,217
Something's burning.

298
00:19:03,258 --> 00:19:05,158
There's the fire.

299
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:06,922
Glory to you, drug-addict.

300
00:19:06,995 --> 00:19:08,087
My friend.

301
00:19:08,163 --> 00:19:09,790
Wonder where he picked up
the habit from.

302
00:19:09,865 --> 00:19:10,923
He is a good painter.

303
00:19:10,999 --> 00:19:13,092
Hi, guys.
- He won't disturb us.

304
00:19:13,168 --> 00:19:14,999
We won't disturb him either.

305
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,332
By the way, Tanya.

306
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:19,863
Your house is just as beautiful
as you. - How sweet.

307
00:19:19,942 --> 00:19:20,931
Thank you, Wilson.

308
00:19:20,976 --> 00:19:21,943
Just be comfortable.

309
00:19:21,977 --> 00:19:23,342
Let me get you something to drink.

310
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:25,880
Should I help you?
- You keep seated.

311
00:19:25,948 --> 00:19:26,812
Keep seated.

312
00:19:26,849 --> 00:19:30,842
I need your help. I need your help.

313
00:19:31,186 --> 00:19:32,915
Listen.

314
00:19:33,322 --> 00:19:34,254
Concentrate on your work.

315
00:19:34,323 --> 00:19:35,381
I was concentrating on my work.

316
00:19:35,457 --> 00:19:38,392
No, you were concentrating more
on Kamasutra.

317
00:19:39,962 --> 00:19:41,054
What happened?

318
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:44,061
You were humiliated.

319
00:19:44,132 --> 00:19:45,292
Thank you.

320
00:19:46,368 --> 00:19:48,233
I guess you guys must be tired.

321
00:19:49,137 --> 00:19:50,399
Why don't you all relax?

322
00:19:50,472 --> 00:19:52,167
And I will show you
the city tonight.

323
00:20:41,356 --> 00:20:42,516
"Stress of life."

324
00:20:42,591 --> 00:20:43,956
"Problems of the world."

325
00:20:44,026 --> 00:20:44,958
"Tension on the mind."

326
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:46,324
"Whoever wants that?"

327
00:20:46,395 --> 00:20:48,886
"Whoever wants that?"

328
00:20:48,964 --> 00:20:51,398
"Everyone wants to live decently."

329
00:20:51,466 --> 00:20:53,957
"No one wants to
take the crooked route."

330
00:20:54,036 --> 00:20:56,402
"When the pocket's empty."

331
00:20:56,471 --> 00:20:58,996
"That's when a bell rings
in the mind."

332
00:20:59,074 --> 00:21:01,440
"Even the Lord gives him
an exception."

333
00:21:01,476 --> 00:21:04,036
"Go and loot who has abundance."

334
00:21:04,112 --> 00:21:05,943
"Loot. Loot."

335
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:08,312
"When fate doesn't favor you,
then go loot."

336
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,910
"Take a sip of your drink,
and go loot."

337
00:21:11,086 --> 00:21:13,418
"If you don't get it, then go loot."

338
00:21:13,488 --> 00:21:16,013
"That is our one way route."

339
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:19,224
"Loot. Loot."

340
00:21:19,294 --> 00:21:21,854
"Loot. Loot."

341
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:24,262
"Loot. Loot."

342
00:21:26,969 --> 00:21:29,301
"Loot. Loot."

343
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:31,896
"Loot. Loot."

344
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:34,408
"Loot. Loot."

345
00:21:39,448 --> 00:21:41,211
"Loot. Loot."

346
00:21:44,519 --> 00:21:46,510
"Loot. Loot."

347
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:49,455
"As long as you can,
get whatever you can."

348
00:21:49,524 --> 00:21:52,516
"Don't let your life
become a daily routine."

349
00:21:52,794 --> 00:21:54,227
"Loot. Loot."

350
00:21:54,496 --> 00:21:57,158
"Whether by hook or by crook."

351
00:21:57,199 --> 00:21:59,759
"Take anything that you can."

352
00:21:59,835 --> 00:22:02,167
"Everyone in this world
is doing the same."

353
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:04,797
"We don't want to be left behind."

354
00:22:04,873 --> 00:22:07,273
"Loot. Loot."

355
00:22:07,342 --> 00:22:09,833
"Loot. Loot."

356
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:12,277
"Loot. Loot."

357
00:22:14,883 --> 00:22:17,374
"Loot. Loot."

358
00:22:17,452 --> 00:22:19,943
"Loot. Loot."

359
00:22:20,022 --> 00:22:22,388
"Loot. Loot."

360
00:22:27,462 --> 00:22:29,259
"Loot. Loot."

361
00:22:32,534 --> 00:22:34,900
"Loot. Loot."

362
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:37,502
"Honesty doesn't always bear fruit."

363
00:22:37,572 --> 00:22:40,905
"It doesn't suit everyone."

364
00:22:42,878 --> 00:22:45,176
"Everyone's in con together."

365
00:22:45,247 --> 00:22:47,807
"Everyone's waiting to rip you off."

366
00:22:47,883 --> 00:22:52,786
"If you try to be honest,
you will be left behind."

367
00:22:52,854 --> 00:22:55,254
"Loot. Loot."

368
00:22:55,323 --> 00:22:57,848
"Loot. Loot."

369
00:22:57,926 --> 00:23:00,326
"Loot. Loot."

370
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:05,398
"Loot. Loot."

371
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:07,958
"Loot. Loot."

372
00:23:08,036 --> 00:23:10,334
"Loot. Loot."

373
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:17,410
"Loot. Loot."

374
00:23:20,549 --> 00:23:22,346
"Loot. Loot."

375
00:23:22,417 --> 00:23:24,942
"When fate doesn't favor you,
then go loot."

376
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:27,454
"Take a sip of your drink,
and go loot."

377
00:23:27,522 --> 00:23:30,116
"When fate doesn't favor you,
then go loot."

378
00:23:30,192 --> 00:23:32,422
"Take a sip of your drink,
and go loot."

379
00:23:32,861 --> 00:23:35,125
"If you don't get it, then go loot."

380
00:23:35,197 --> 00:23:37,495
"That is our one way route."

381
00:23:38,366 --> 00:23:40,891
"Loot. Loot."

382
00:23:40,969 --> 00:23:43,335
"Loot. Loot."

383
00:23:43,405 --> 00:23:45,498
"Loot. Loot."

384
00:23:48,376 --> 00:23:50,936
"Loot. Loot."

385
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:53,344
"Loot. Loot."

386
00:23:53,415 --> 00:23:55,940
"Loot. Loot."

387
00:24:01,056 --> 00:24:03,115
"Loot. Loot."

388
00:24:06,161 --> 00:24:08,129
"Loot. Loot."

389
00:24:14,503 --> 00:24:15,800
So?

390
00:24:16,771 --> 00:24:17,897
What are you doing here?

391
00:24:17,939 --> 00:24:19,133
Mr. Khan has sent me.

392
00:24:20,775 --> 00:24:22,834
Did he send you by car or courier?

393
00:24:22,911 --> 00:24:24,344
He wants to see you.

394
00:24:24,412 --> 00:24:26,073
You knew that I am here.

395
00:24:26,982 --> 00:24:29,883
And you came here just
to tell me this. - Yes.

396
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:34,947
In the year 1876,
a gentlemen named Graham Bell...

397
00:24:35,023 --> 00:24:38,959
...made an invention which
revolutionized the world.

398
00:24:40,829 --> 00:24:42,854
I didn't understand
what you are trying to say?

399
00:24:43,198 --> 00:24:44,825
I don't understand that,
you could have...

400
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,767
...told me through
Graham Bell's invention...

401
00:24:48,103 --> 00:24:51,095
...that Khan sir has called me.

402
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:54,341
No, no, you won't understand.

403
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:56,502
I mean you could have
called me on my phone...

404
00:24:56,778 --> 00:24:58,370
...why come so far?

405
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,509
Mr. Khan wanted me to say this
to you personally.

406
00:25:03,151 --> 00:25:05,449
Oh, personal touch.

407
00:25:06,288 --> 00:25:07,846
I am very touched.

408
00:25:10,091 --> 00:25:13,026
Now I understood why
you came here yourself.

409
00:25:13,995 --> 00:25:18,455
So you might know why Mr.
Khan sends me to people.

410
00:25:18,533 --> 00:25:22,401
Are you here to call me,
tell me or scare me?

411
00:25:24,206 --> 00:25:25,264
I don't have time.

412
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,773
No time.
- Okay.

413
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:28,970
I will tell Mr. Khan about this.

414
00:25:29,244 --> 00:25:30,939
I was just joking.

415
00:25:31,012 --> 00:25:32,343
I am coming. I am coming.

416
00:25:33,048 --> 00:25:34,208
Listen to me.

417
00:25:35,083 --> 00:25:37,017
What is the matter, Mr. Khan?
You are still awake.

418
00:25:37,085 --> 00:25:39,553
No, no, its been really
long since I last met.

419
00:25:39,821 --> 00:25:42,551
I didn't even talk to
you so I called you.

420
00:25:42,824 --> 00:25:45,759
How are you, Lala?
- Fit, absolutely fit.

421
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:47,227
Will you have something?
- Yes.

422
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:49,456
No, no.
- Sit, sit, sit.

423
00:25:51,499 --> 00:25:54,764
I heard that Hafiz's men
paid you a visit? - Yes.

424
00:25:54,836 --> 00:25:57,304
They wanted to buy one
of my old properties.

425
00:25:58,073 --> 00:26:01,270
That means Hafiz is earning well.

426
00:26:01,409 --> 00:26:05,106
Yes, myriad profits.
- What profit?

427
00:26:05,347 --> 00:26:07,781
Myriad means, countless.

428
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:12,309
When you can say countless
then why say myriad?

429
00:26:13,054 --> 00:26:15,454
Myriad makes it sound good.

430
00:26:20,028 --> 00:26:22,053
Khan sir, here's Pakeeza's DVD.

431
00:26:24,299 --> 00:26:25,823
Great.

432
00:26:25,867 --> 00:26:28,062
There was something
about the old heroines.

433
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:33,134
You would want to fall
in love with them.

434
00:26:33,908 --> 00:26:37,435
But the heroines these days...
- I understood.

435
00:26:40,415 --> 00:26:42,315
Come, let's watch Pakeeza,

436
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:45,183
No, no, I... would like
to go home and rest...

437
00:26:45,253 --> 00:26:47,016
...if you don't mind?

438
00:26:47,255 --> 00:26:48,279
Of course, of course.

439
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:51,120
Go, go, go.
I don't have any objections.

440
00:26:51,159 --> 00:26:54,458
But go to your own home.

441
00:26:56,298 --> 00:26:59,324
I heard about your younger brother.

442
00:26:59,401 --> 00:27:02,234
He was getting out of control.

443
00:27:02,771 --> 00:27:05,262
But breaking your
own brother's hand...

444
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:08,901
Mr. Khan, we are dons for everyone.

445
00:27:09,744 --> 00:27:11,041
And if we spare our kin...

446
00:27:11,112 --> 00:27:12,909
...then how will
the others respect us?

447
00:27:13,915 --> 00:27:16,406
And being a don without respect...

448
00:27:17,952 --> 00:27:20,011
...is like Pakeeza
without Meena Kumari.

449
00:27:23,825 --> 00:27:26,817
Pakeeza... without Meena Kumari.

450
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:30,190
What did he say?

451
00:27:40,342 --> 00:27:42,867
Guys, this is the blue
print of Johnson's house.

452
00:27:43,345 --> 00:27:46,178
This is the back entrance
and this is the front entrance.

453
00:27:46,314 --> 00:27:47,941
Here's the parking lot.

454
00:27:48,016 --> 00:27:50,143
There's a gate here and here.

455
00:27:51,152 --> 00:27:53,882
The music is suppressing your voice.

456
00:27:53,955 --> 00:27:56,355
I cannot hear anything
you are saying.

457
00:27:57,859 --> 00:27:59,417
I can only hear music.

458
00:27:59,494 --> 00:28:01,086
The rascal.

459
00:28:01,162 --> 00:28:02,993
Is this a house or a disco?

460
00:28:03,064 --> 00:28:04,998
The music is coming from upstairs.

461
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:06,893
So, you go upstairs...

462
00:28:06,968 --> 00:28:10,301
...and bring the volume
of his music down.

463
00:28:11,172 --> 00:28:13,037
My neighbor, he is a madman.

464
00:28:13,308 --> 00:28:15,435
What would have happened
to all of you...

465
00:28:16,044 --> 00:28:17,170
...if I hadn't come here?

466
00:28:17,245 --> 00:28:18,269
I will go take a look.

467
00:28:18,346 --> 00:28:20,007
Wilson, please listen.

468
00:28:21,049 --> 00:28:22,346
Don't worry, babes.

469
00:28:22,851 --> 00:28:24,079
I will be right back.

470
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,791
What?

471
00:28:34,329 --> 00:28:35,762
Music.

472
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:36,956
What?

473
00:28:37,031 --> 00:28:38,931
Little low.

474
00:28:39,167 --> 00:28:41,101
Please.
- No.

475
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:50,472
Get lost.

476
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:57,011
"Don't worry, babe."

477
00:28:57,085 --> 00:28:58,177
"Be right back, babe."

478
00:28:58,953 --> 00:29:00,113
Are you done?

479
00:29:01,389 --> 00:29:02,822
At least he returned alive.

480
00:29:02,891 --> 00:29:04,051
Builder, you are still seated.

481
00:29:19,307 --> 00:29:20,365
What?

482
00:29:23,144 --> 00:29:25,135
Wow, what was amazing?

483
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,838
What did you say?
- Nothing.

484
00:29:27,048 --> 00:29:28,242
Nothing,

485
00:29:28,416 --> 00:29:30,748
He has punched him, why will
he say anything. Forget it.

486
00:29:30,819 --> 00:29:32,514
Anyway, let's get back to work.

487
00:29:33,221 --> 00:29:34,950
There's a security
alarm on the front door.

488
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:36,354
And this is the back entrance.

489
00:29:37,225 --> 00:29:40,194
There is no security on this wall,
no guards either.

490
00:29:40,395 --> 00:29:42,056
So it should be very easy.

491
00:29:42,997 --> 00:29:44,055
Yes.

492
00:29:44,132 --> 00:29:45,463
Very easy.

493
00:29:46,968 --> 00:29:48,230
You keep this blue-print.

494
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:50,003
It will help you in the loot.

495
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:52,070
Where will I keep this blue print?

496
00:29:52,474 --> 00:29:53,839
I...

497
00:29:54,309 --> 00:29:55,241
Is this your bag?

498
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:56,777
Can I keep it here?
- No.

499
00:29:56,845 --> 00:29:57,971
This isn't my bag.

500
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:00,037
It belongs to Batliwala's brother.

501
00:30:00,114 --> 00:30:01,945
You can keep it, might be useful.

502
00:30:02,016 --> 00:30:04,143
Its Batliwala's brother.

503
00:30:04,352 --> 00:30:05,478
Then I can keep it.

504
00:30:07,288 --> 00:30:10,314
Actually, you will need a car
for tonight's loot.

505
00:30:11,326 --> 00:30:12,850
Pandit.

506
00:30:28,109 --> 00:30:30,942
Hands up.
- Hands up. Hands up.

507
00:30:30,979 --> 00:30:32,344
His hands are already up.

508
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:33,880
Look there.

509
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:35,507
Let's see whose it is.

510
00:30:37,018 --> 00:30:38,485
It looks okay from the back.

511
00:30:38,553 --> 00:30:40,180
Let's take a look at the front.

512
00:30:41,155 --> 00:30:42,486
Give me your money, come on.

513
00:30:44,459 --> 00:30:45,926
What the **** is this?

514
00:30:45,994 --> 00:30:47,052
Give me money.

515
00:30:47,128 --> 00:30:48,390
More money.
- Give me more money.

516
00:30:50,865 --> 00:30:53,493
So, how is it?
- Its like a car.

517
00:30:56,204 --> 00:30:57,171
No more money, no more money.

518
00:30:57,205 --> 00:30:59,173
I said give me more money.
- More money, more money.

519
00:30:59,207 --> 00:31:00,504
Give us the money.
- I swear.

520
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:02,800
Brother, there is
nothing else in it.

521
00:31:03,344 --> 00:31:04,402
I don't think he has got more money.

522
00:31:04,479 --> 00:31:06,071
Come on, let's get out of here.

523
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:13,284
Where the **** is the car.

524
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:28,460
Akbar, is this a car or a horse?

525
00:31:28,836 --> 00:31:31,396
Brother, this car has many horses.

526
00:31:31,472 --> 00:31:34,134
350 horsepower, 300 torque.

527
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:41,411
This car has more
tricks than Rajnikant.

528
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:43,279
But we aren't making a film.

529
00:31:43,351 --> 00:31:44,545
We are going to commit a theft.

530
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:46,980
Your car will be the centre
of everyone's attraction.

531
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:49,983
We will be caught.

532
00:31:50,024 --> 00:31:51,924
We are going to plunder,
not be plundered.

533
00:31:55,930 --> 00:31:57,397
Pandit.

534
00:31:58,066 --> 00:31:59,397
Pandit.

535
00:32:00,301 --> 00:32:03,464
Greenery is growing out of
the doors and walls 'Ghalib'

536
00:32:04,372 --> 00:32:06,397
I am in wilderness and...

537
00:32:07,208 --> 00:32:09,142
...spring has arrived at my house.

538
00:32:11,112 --> 00:32:14,878
There's a car approaching
at the house ahead.

539
00:32:22,991 --> 00:32:24,549
What the...

540
00:32:25,259 --> 00:32:26,351
There are guards here.

541
00:32:26,427 --> 00:32:27,951
But Tanya said that...

542
00:32:29,097 --> 00:32:30,894
Builder, get the guard.
- What did you say?

543
00:32:30,965 --> 00:32:32,432
Get the guard.

544
00:32:33,001 --> 00:32:36,835
When everyone's together...
then we will get the guard.

545
00:32:36,971 --> 00:32:38,871
Come on.
- That's exactly what I am saying.

546
00:33:03,865 --> 00:33:05,093
Come on.

547
00:34:01,222 --> 00:34:03,850
Shall I put up a loudspeaker?
- No, give him a mike.

548
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:06,351
Doors are opened and not broken.

549
00:34:08,529 --> 00:34:10,121
Do it and don't just say.

550
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:11,958
When you can do with a needle...

551
00:34:12,033 --> 00:34:14,228
...then don't use the sword.
Get aside.

552
00:34:14,402 --> 00:34:16,893
Doesn't know a thing and wants
to compete with the experts.

553
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:18,336
Here you go. Open sesame.

554
00:34:18,906 --> 00:34:19,998
Get inside.

555
00:34:27,181 --> 00:34:30,048
Don't try to act smart
or else I will shoot you.

556
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:32,248
He's the guard here.

557
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,050
You handle him.

558
00:34:36,924 --> 00:34:38,983
You don't know who I am.

559
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:42,288
We don't rob our kin.

560
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:45,355
Are we here to get
to know each other?

561
00:34:46,267 --> 00:34:47,325
Who I am?

562
00:34:49,737 --> 00:34:50,829
My name is Lala.

563
00:34:50,905 --> 00:34:52,304
Did we ask for your name?

564
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:56,935
Lala?

565
00:34:57,011 --> 00:34:59,206
Would it have made a difference...

566
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,111
...if it had been Aa Aa or Ja Ja.

567
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:06,952
Akbar, the boss was
mentioning some John.

568
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:09,182
Yes, Lala Johnson.

569
00:35:09,457 --> 00:35:10,822
You are just...

570
00:35:10,892 --> 00:35:12,052
Just a minute.

571
00:35:14,262 --> 00:35:15,957
Jesus Christ.

572
00:35:16,931 --> 00:35:18,922
He's an escaped don from Pakistan...

573
00:35:20,001 --> 00:35:21,491
...Taufiq Omar Khhatta.

574
00:35:26,174 --> 00:35:27,072
Don?

575
00:35:27,141 --> 00:35:30,474
Like the one the police
of 11 countries are after

576
00:35:30,912 --> 00:35:32,539
Don. Forgive us.

577
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:33,906
What are you doing, Pandit?

578
00:35:33,981 --> 00:35:36,211
What a blunder you have made?
- Relax.

579
00:35:36,284 --> 00:35:37,774
Don.

580
00:35:37,852 --> 00:35:38,910
Akbar.

581
00:35:39,787 --> 00:35:40,947
Call Batliwala.

582
00:35:41,022 --> 00:35:43,013
Ask him why he sent
us to the wrong place.

583
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:44,148
Can I make a call?

584
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:45,419
Did you take my
permission before tying me up?

585
00:35:45,493 --> 00:35:48,929
Look, we came here to steal
and not to make a call.

586
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,959
So we tied you up
without asking you.

587
00:35:51,165 --> 00:35:53,190
We will steal without asking you.
Yes.

588
00:35:53,267 --> 00:35:55,428
But we will make a call
only after asking you.

589
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,162
So...

590
00:35:57,905 --> 00:35:59,065
Go ahead, make the call.

591
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:01,404
Hey, go ahead, make the call.

592
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:03,202
Come on.

593
00:36:14,822 --> 00:36:16,790
Hello, boss, this is me speaking?

594
00:36:16,991 --> 00:36:18,015
Who?

595
00:36:18,326 --> 00:36:20,226
Akbar from
Johnson's house in Pattaya.

596
00:36:20,294 --> 00:36:21,386
But Johnson's saying he is Lala...

597
00:36:21,462 --> 00:36:23,896
...and Wilson is saying
that he is don. - Who don?

598
00:36:23,965 --> 00:36:25,023
"Try to recognize me?"

599
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:26,828
"Where did I come from?
Who am I?" That Don.

600
00:36:27,034 --> 00:36:28,501
But that's what he is saying?
What are you saying?

601
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:32,364
Where are you speaking from?
- From the phone.

602
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:37,036
Whose phone?
- Panasonic.

603
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:39,875
Crazy, mobile or landline.

604
00:36:40,514 --> 00:36:42,982
I am speaking from a landline...

605
00:36:43,017 --> 00:36:45,884
...I do have that much brains.

606
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:47,887
Its not costing us a penny,
don't worry.

607
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:49,817
You fool, you will get us killed.

608
00:36:49,891 --> 00:36:51,859
My number will be displayed
on the landline's bill.

609
00:36:51,926 --> 00:36:53,257
Where is Builder?

610
00:36:56,764 --> 00:36:57,458
Yes, boss.

611
00:36:57,498 --> 00:37:01,332
Builder, take all the money
in the safe and get out.

612
00:37:02,069 --> 00:37:06,403
And next time I shouldn't get
a call from Akbar or the landline.

613
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:08,203
Okay.
- Fine, boss.

614
00:37:08,242 --> 00:37:10,073
The boss says get the money
in the safe and get out.

615
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:11,975
Akbar, open the safe, quickly.

616
00:37:24,091 --> 00:37:25,251
That's all.

617
00:37:26,127 --> 00:37:27,526
Quickly, quickly.
- Here you go.

618
00:37:30,097 --> 00:37:31,121
Audio cassette.

619
00:37:31,198 --> 00:37:33,029
The boss says get everything
in the safe.

620
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:34,397
Maybe he is involved in piracy.

621
00:37:35,269 --> 00:37:36,429
Come on, quickly.

622
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:37,869
You are just...

623
00:37:38,072 --> 00:37:39,801
The safe is clean. No hard feelings.

624
00:37:43,444 --> 00:37:46,936
It's not difficult for me to
find four Indians in Pattaya.

625
00:37:47,281 --> 00:37:49,146
I would have thought once more...

626
00:37:50,084 --> 00:37:51,210
...if I had been in your place.

627
00:37:51,252 --> 00:37:55,416
The situation is... that
you are not in our place...

628
00:37:55,489 --> 00:37:57,252
...and we are not in your place.

629
00:38:00,127 --> 00:38:02,823
And by chance
if we had been in your place...

630
00:38:02,897 --> 00:38:04,023
...then we wouldn't
have let you catch us.

631
00:38:04,098 --> 00:38:04,962
We would have run away.

632
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:07,125
Hey, not that way.

633
00:38:07,935 --> 00:38:09,129
Through the back door.

634
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:10,261
Why?

635
00:38:10,338 --> 00:38:11,862
There's an Indian
intelligence officer...

636
00:38:11,939 --> 00:38:13,998
...in the building in the
front keeping watch on me.

637
00:38:15,309 --> 00:38:17,777
If you go out, you will be caught.

638
00:38:24,852 --> 00:38:25,511
He is right.

639
00:38:25,786 --> 00:38:26,775
He is.

640
00:38:26,854 --> 00:38:27,912
Just a minute.

641
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:32,085
Why be so generous with us?

642
00:38:34,261 --> 00:38:37,253
Because it will be much more
fun to find you and finish you.

643
00:38:40,434 --> 00:38:43,164
I normally don't spare
those who threaten me.

644
00:38:44,305 --> 00:38:48,435
You are fortunate that
I am only gagging you.

645
00:39:00,321 --> 00:39:02,016
Wow, that was fast.

646
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:04,887
I didn't know you will
make it back so soon. - Why?

647
00:39:05,326 --> 00:39:08,727
You had a different plan?
- Meaning.

648
00:39:08,796 --> 00:39:12,027
Meaning, you gave us
the wrong address.

649
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:13,964
Look, lady, contact of Batliwala.

650
00:39:14,035 --> 00:39:15,366
We had to go to Johnson's house,

651
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:18,030
There was no Johnson at the address
that you gave us.

652
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:20,801
It was some underworld don
Lala Bhatti.

653
00:39:21,142 --> 00:39:23,167
You would have landed us in trouble.

654
00:39:23,377 --> 00:39:24,469
Wrong address.

655
00:39:25,046 --> 00:39:27,276
9945, Pattaya Beach Road.

656
00:39:28,482 --> 00:39:31,144
9945, Pattaya Beach Street.

657
00:39:32,486 --> 00:39:34,249
Silly mistake.

658
00:39:34,422 --> 00:39:36,481
We mixed up between road
and street...

659
00:39:36,757 --> 00:39:39,123
...and went inside the wrong house.
I am sorry.

660
00:39:39,193 --> 00:39:40,785
Is it safe where you are going now?

661
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:43,987
What is the difference between
road and street? It's the same.

662
00:39:44,065 --> 00:39:46,056
It's the same as India Gate
and Gateway Of India.

663
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:47,430
We went to the wrong address.

664
00:40:18,566 --> 00:40:19,828
Hello.

665
00:40:35,449 --> 00:40:37,417
Baby.

666
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:40,047
Bobo.

667
00:40:44,825 --> 00:40:46,793
Bobo.

668
00:40:48,395 --> 00:40:49,862
Sleep now.

669
00:40:52,299 --> 00:40:54,358
Toffee. Wrong number.

670
00:41:15,089 --> 00:41:16,181
Lala.

671
00:41:17,124 --> 00:41:18,182
Boss.

672
00:41:20,161 --> 00:41:21,253
Boss, is that you?

673
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:23,860
Boss, is that you?

674
00:41:23,931 --> 00:41:25,990
I am coming, boss. I am there.

675
00:41:27,168 --> 00:41:29,466
Everyday I get to see a new game.

676
00:41:32,806 --> 00:41:34,899
The posting in
India was much better.

677
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:37,407
We've been locked up
in this room for a year.

678
00:41:37,878 --> 00:41:39,402
It was much more open back there.

679
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:43,811
Yes, that's true, Mishra.

680
00:41:44,018 --> 00:41:45,417
Everything was open back there.

681
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:51,155
The mall, the gutter,
and people also urinate in the open.

682
00:41:51,825 --> 00:41:52,519
No matter what you say, sir.

683
00:41:52,793 --> 00:41:54,226
Our country is unique.

684
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:57,958
Yes, that's true.

685
00:41:58,999 --> 00:42:03,265
50 years ago Gandhiji
got us Independence.

686
00:42:04,138 --> 00:42:07,938
And what did we give
to India 50 years later.

687
00:42:08,209 --> 00:42:09,403
A population of 100 crores.

688
00:42:10,211 --> 00:42:13,271
We two and our five,
that is our slogan.

689
00:42:13,347 --> 00:42:14,905
Sir, Razaq's car has just arrived.

690
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:25,925
Oh, God.

691
00:42:25,993 --> 00:42:27,153
What has happened?

692
00:42:27,228 --> 00:42:28,286
Say something, boss.

693
00:42:28,562 --> 00:42:29,859
Boss, say something.

694
00:42:31,332 --> 00:42:32,993
I am so sorry. I am so sorry.

695
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:35,958
Don't worry, boss.

696
00:42:36,036 --> 00:42:37,128
I am right here. I am right here.

697
00:42:37,204 --> 00:42:38,466
Nothing can happen to you.

698
00:42:38,539 --> 00:42:40,336
You are there, aren't you?
- Yes, sir.

699
00:42:40,374 --> 00:42:41,864
Sure.
- Yes, sir.

700
00:42:42,109 --> 00:42:43,303
Then pick me up, fool.

701
00:42:43,377 --> 00:42:44,935
Okay, okay, sir.

702
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:47,212
Oh, God.

703
00:42:47,281 --> 00:42:49,306
Sir, you have put on weight, sir.

704
00:42:49,383 --> 00:42:51,476
Sir. Are you okay, sir?

705
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:55,478
Do I look okay?
- No.

706
00:42:56,023 --> 00:42:57,354
Then that means I am not fine.

707
00:42:58,392 --> 00:43:00,417
Now free me.
- Oh, I am so sorry.

708
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:01,518
So sorry.

709
00:43:01,795 --> 00:43:03,228
They tied you really tight.

710
00:43:05,933 --> 00:43:07,798
All four were Indians.

711
00:43:11,372 --> 00:43:14,466
Indians from India.
- Maybe.

712
00:43:15,809 --> 00:43:17,902
Fools, Indians are
from India after all.

713
00:43:17,978 --> 00:43:19,172
What did they take, sir?

714
00:43:20,047 --> 00:43:21,139
Everything.

715
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:23,183
Everything?
- Yes.

716
00:43:24,251 --> 00:43:27,049
But you still look
very courageous, boss.

717
00:43:27,121 --> 00:43:29,055
Do you know why?
- Why?

718
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:35,052
Because you will bring them
to me in 24 hours. - I will.

719
00:43:35,896 --> 00:43:37,056
Very simple, sir.

720
00:43:37,097 --> 00:43:39,861
I will go, catch them
and bring them before you.

721
00:43:44,138 --> 00:43:46,163
Will you catch them standing here?

722
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:48,171
No, sir. No, sir.

723
00:43:48,242 --> 00:43:50,267
For that... Don't worry, sir.

724
00:43:50,344 --> 00:43:53,313
Before... before you
finish your drink.

725
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:55,348
Razaq, what was that?

726
00:43:55,516 --> 00:43:58,383
Baby.

727
00:44:01,221 --> 00:44:02,745
Don't worry, I will bring them.

728
00:44:02,823 --> 00:44:04,290
Get lost.

729
00:44:11,832 --> 00:44:13,390
Brother, where are we going?

730
00:44:14,134 --> 00:44:16,068
What do you think?
Where should we go?

731
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:17,495
Where should we go?
- Police station.

732
00:44:17,771 --> 00:44:18,760
Police station?

733
00:44:18,839 --> 00:44:22,468
We should lodge a report
for our car that was stolen

734
00:44:22,543 --> 00:44:27,037
My name is Asif... - Brother,
we need to tell the police that...

735
00:44:27,114 --> 00:44:28,911
And Asif doesn't go to the police.

736
00:44:28,982 --> 00:44:29,880
Then what? Then what?

737
00:44:29,950 --> 00:44:32,077
The police come to Asif.

738
00:44:32,152 --> 00:44:33,551
Brother...
- Understand.

739
00:44:44,798 --> 00:44:45,992
Hi.

740
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:05,316
What are you up to, handsome?

741
00:45:05,386 --> 00:45:07,752
I was going to listen
to some music. - Music?

742
00:45:07,955 --> 00:45:09,354
What type of music?

743
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:13,851
Sad songs.
- Sad songs.

744
00:45:15,295 --> 00:45:17,388
Someone broke your heart.

745
00:45:18,132 --> 00:45:20,225
Angelina.
- Jolie?

746
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:23,133
No, my neighbor.

747
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:26,902
She used to live besides my room.

748
00:45:28,008 --> 00:45:30,442
Can I help?

749
00:45:31,178 --> 00:45:32,509
If you do something...

750
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:35,247
...then I can do a lot.

751
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:39,213
Look.

752
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:42,848
My heart is beating for you.

753
00:45:42,923 --> 00:45:47,155
Wilson, your heart is
beating at the wrong place.

754
00:45:49,963 --> 00:45:51,157
Sorry.

755
00:45:52,032 --> 00:45:55,934
First time I failed.
- No, you passed.

756
00:45:57,471 --> 00:45:59,371
What?
- Closer.

757
00:46:00,307 --> 00:46:02,332
Closer.
- Closer.

758
00:46:03,277 --> 00:46:05,074
Closer.
- Closer.

759
00:46:17,157 --> 00:46:18,385
Baby.

760
00:46:27,067 --> 00:46:28,091
Tanya.

761
00:46:31,271 --> 00:46:32,533
Tanya.

762
00:46:33,307 --> 00:46:36,401
She left.
- What?

763
00:46:37,344 --> 00:46:38,971
She left.

764
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:41,542
Oh no, guys.

765
00:46:42,449 --> 00:46:43,438
Get up, guys.

766
00:46:43,817 --> 00:46:44,909
Get up, guys. Please.

767
00:46:45,252 --> 00:46:46,310
She left.

768
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:49,013
Tanya ran away with the loot money.

769
00:46:49,089 --> 00:46:50,784
Get up. Please. Please.

770
00:46:51,258 --> 00:46:53,749
She left. She took everything.

771
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:56,893
She was sleeping with him.

772
00:46:57,130 --> 00:46:59,155
You should have kept
your heavy leg on her.

773
00:47:03,337 --> 00:47:05,999
Builder, what an idiot
did you bring along?

774
00:47:06,373 --> 00:47:08,136
I just brought him to Pattaya.

775
00:47:08,475 --> 00:47:11,410
I want to know who his father is
who brought him in this world.

776
00:47:11,478 --> 00:47:14,447
Hey, don't talk about my father.

777
00:47:14,515 --> 00:47:15,948
Then who else should we talk about?

778
00:47:16,016 --> 00:47:19,008
About that girl who slept with you?
- Sorry.

779
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:21,510
Girls are my weakness.

780
00:47:21,788 --> 00:47:22,777
Really.

781
00:47:22,856 --> 00:47:24,881
I thought your brains are weak.

782
00:47:25,125 --> 00:47:27,093
She came to me.

783
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:28,354
And you became Batman.

784
00:47:28,428 --> 00:47:31,454
Meaning you had a chance
to bat without fielding.

785
00:47:31,532 --> 00:47:33,397
That means when we were
sleeping out of tiredness...

786
00:47:33,901 --> 00:47:35,994
...he was getting
tired of sleeping, right?

787
00:47:36,069 --> 00:47:37,434
Did you doubt her or not?

788
00:47:38,171 --> 00:47:41,766
Did you doubt the girl or not?
- No.

789
00:47:42,776 --> 00:47:44,243
She said that her mother is blind.

790
00:47:44,311 --> 00:47:46,472
Then you should have
given her your eyes.

791
00:47:47,047 --> 00:47:48,036
What else did she say?

792
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:51,107
She said that she doesn't
know where her father is.

793
00:47:51,184 --> 00:47:54,813
Tell me one thing.

794
00:47:55,389 --> 00:47:59,723
When her mother is blind...

795
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:03,156
...then how will she
know who the father is.

796
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:08,033
Try to use your brains sometimes.

797
00:48:09,036 --> 00:48:13,439
That girl put your
underwear on your head.

798
00:48:13,507 --> 00:48:14,496
Have you heard that saying?

799
00:48:14,775 --> 00:48:16,106
Out of the frying
pan and into the fire.

800
00:48:16,176 --> 00:48:18,144
But you intentionally invited
that gorgeous trouble for yourself.

801
00:48:18,178 --> 00:48:19,805
She made a fool out of you.

802
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:21,848
I said sorry.

803
00:48:22,115 --> 00:48:24,447
Will you keep taunting me all day...

804
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:27,351
...or find a way to look for her.
- Yes.

805
00:48:27,421 --> 00:48:28,979
We will have to think about it.

806
00:48:29,022 --> 00:48:30,455
We will have to think about it.

807
00:48:30,524 --> 00:48:33,459
You must be tired
after last night, isn't it?

808
00:48:34,795 --> 00:48:35,989
Just a minute.

809
00:48:36,396 --> 00:48:37,522
I remembered.

810
00:48:38,231 --> 00:48:41,894
Last night I put a cassette
in the recorder.

811
00:48:42,235 --> 00:48:44,032
You did put it in the recorder,
didn't you?

812
00:48:44,104 --> 00:48:45,435
No, no, think about it.

813
00:48:45,472 --> 00:48:47,064
Did you put it somewhere else?

814
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:49,366
I had put it in the recorder.

815
00:48:49,409 --> 00:48:50,842
Then go, check.

816
00:48:51,078 --> 00:48:52,909
Check it. Recorder.

817
00:48:56,416 --> 00:48:57,849
Hello, Mustaq.
- Yes, brother.

818
00:48:57,918 --> 00:48:59,249
How are you?
- I am fine.

819
00:48:59,319 --> 00:49:00,843
What have you
thought about Khan sir?

820
00:49:00,921 --> 00:49:01,910
As you say?

821
00:49:01,989 --> 00:49:04,355
The old man's already
nearing his death.

822
00:49:04,424 --> 00:49:06,892
With your help I can
send him into his grave.

823
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:09,793
If there's a problem...
- That old man is the problem.

824
00:49:09,863 --> 00:49:11,888
Once we get him out of the way...

825
00:49:11,965 --> 00:49:13,865
...then there won't be any problem.

826
00:49:14,735 --> 00:49:16,726
But... but...
- Why are you scared?

827
00:49:16,937 --> 00:49:19,735
I have spoken to Swan,
Lee and Liakat.

828
00:49:19,806 --> 00:49:20,898
They are with me.

829
00:49:20,974 --> 00:49:23,033
Once Mr. Khan is out of the way...

830
00:49:23,110 --> 00:49:24,805
...then all of Thailand's
business will be ours.

831
00:49:24,878 --> 00:49:27,506
So, are you with
us or with Khan sir?

832
00:49:27,848 --> 00:49:29,008
I have always been with you.

833
00:49:29,082 --> 00:49:30,743
This is Lala.

834
00:49:31,151 --> 00:49:33,119
He's talking about
killing some Khan.

835
00:49:34,287 --> 00:49:36,278
We are landing
in a different problem.

836
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:41,186
I think we should look
for Tanya, first.

837
00:49:41,461 --> 00:49:43,053
But how?

838
00:49:43,196 --> 00:49:44,891
Every time that how?

839
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:48,061
Last night
you didn't ask anyone "How".

840
00:49:49,036 --> 00:49:50,264
Forget it.

841
00:49:50,537 --> 00:49:51,936
Let's find Virender and Sharmilee.

842
00:49:52,005 --> 00:49:53,404
They will know where they are.

843
00:49:53,473 --> 00:49:54,997
I think that's a better idea.
- Let's go take a look.

844
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:56,201
Come on.

845
00:49:56,276 --> 00:49:57,334
"Stress of life."

846
00:49:57,411 --> 00:49:58,400
"Problems of the world."

847
00:49:58,478 --> 00:49:59,410
"Tension on the mind."

848
00:49:59,479 --> 00:50:00,969
"Whoever wants that?"

849
00:50:02,949 --> 00:50:05,144
"Everyone wants to live decently."

850
00:50:05,218 --> 00:50:07,982
"No one wants to take
the crooked route."

851
00:50:09,523 --> 00:50:11,889
"When someone's not that lucky."

852
00:50:11,958 --> 00:50:14,051
"That's when a bell rings
in the mind."

853
00:50:14,127 --> 00:50:16,186
"Even the Lord gives
him an exception."

854
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:18,356
"Go and loot who has abundance."

855
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:20,525
"Loot. Loot."

856
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:31,400
"Loot. Loot."

857
00:50:34,214 --> 00:50:36,205
That was great.

858
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:38,183
You skinned him
without using the knife.

859
00:50:38,251 --> 00:50:39,343
That was great.

860
00:50:39,419 --> 00:50:41,853
So what?
Why take the trouble of coming here?

861
00:50:43,490 --> 00:50:44,821
It's like this.

862
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:48,853
You look so ugly.

863
00:50:48,929 --> 00:50:50,920
I will gut you right here.

864
00:50:50,997 --> 00:50:53,090
I am talking to you decently
but you don't understand...

865
00:50:55,035 --> 00:50:57,799
What do I say? How do I say?

866
00:50:58,338 --> 00:51:01,171
And I say who should I say?

867
00:51:01,508 --> 00:51:02,941
Look, mister.

868
00:51:03,009 --> 00:51:04,943
Who are you calling mister?

869
00:51:05,011 --> 00:51:06,205
Don't trouble us.

870
00:51:07,147 --> 00:51:09,911
Hey fool. Rascal.

871
00:51:10,083 --> 00:51:12,415
You think you are smart but
once I am through with you...

872
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:14,818
...then you won't be
able to do anything.

873
00:51:14,888 --> 00:51:15,786
People will take you to your grave.

874
00:51:15,856 --> 00:51:16,515
And will take part
in your procession as well.

875
00:51:16,790 --> 00:51:17,518
And this is just a warning.

876
00:51:17,791 --> 00:51:19,952
If you act smart then we
will show what we can really do.

877
00:51:19,993 --> 00:51:23,952
Pandit.
- I am just explaining to him.

878
00:51:24,364 --> 00:51:25,854
That you
brandished the knife at us...

879
00:51:25,899 --> 00:51:26,957
...and he pulled the gun at you.

880
00:51:27,033 --> 00:51:28,557
The score is settled.

881
00:51:29,035 --> 00:51:30,059
That was a good dialogue.

882
00:51:30,137 --> 00:51:31,297
Then look at this.

883
00:51:32,305 --> 00:51:33,829
Its money.

884
00:51:36,143 --> 00:51:38,008
First gun and now note.

885
00:51:38,211 --> 00:51:39,303
What do you want?

886
00:51:40,213 --> 00:51:41,339
Tanya.

887
00:51:41,381 --> 00:51:42,939
We want her whereabouts.

888
00:51:48,789 --> 00:51:51,485
Tanya. Indian girl. Find her.

889
00:52:26,459 --> 00:52:27,448
Come on.
- Wilson.

890
00:52:27,527 --> 00:52:28,892
Come on.

891
00:52:29,996 --> 00:52:31,327
You are hurting me.

892
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:34,962
Why did you do it?

893
00:52:35,936 --> 00:52:37,130
What did you think?

894
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:39,395
You can fool us and run away...

895
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:41,498
...and we won't even look for you.

896
00:52:43,543 --> 00:52:45,170
There is a huge amount
missing from this, brother.

897
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:46,439
I know.

898
00:52:51,151 --> 00:52:53,745
Where is the rest
of the money, Tanya?

899
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:54,978
I don't know.

900
00:52:55,055 --> 00:52:56,852
The window is open.

901
00:52:57,324 --> 00:52:59,019
The breeze is coming in.

902
00:53:00,093 --> 00:53:01,958
If we don't get the desired answer.

903
00:53:02,495 --> 00:53:04,019
Then she is going out of the window.

904
00:53:04,097 --> 00:53:05,325
I said, I don't know.

905
00:53:05,398 --> 00:53:06,456
You don't know.

906
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:09,095
Then what do you know, Tanya?

907
00:53:09,169 --> 00:53:11,137
Why don't you stick
around and find out?

908
00:53:23,416 --> 00:53:24,940
Hi, baby.

909
00:53:24,985 --> 00:53:26,179
No, baby, baba.

910
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:27,980
Come on.

911
00:53:30,190 --> 00:53:31,282
Keep this inside.

912
00:53:31,358 --> 00:53:32,347
Intelligence officer.

913
00:53:32,425 --> 00:53:34,393
Baby.
- Intelligence officer.

914
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:36,986
She is quite an intelligent lady.

915
00:53:37,330 --> 00:53:40,857
She managed to rope in an
intelligence officer in Pattaya.

916
00:53:41,234 --> 00:53:44,169
You are quite intelligent.

917
00:53:44,371 --> 00:53:47,067
Your gun, officer.

918
00:53:47,774 --> 00:53:49,867
Now I understand.

919
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:52,937
We are being tricked into this.

920
00:53:54,147 --> 00:53:58,311
We were sent to the address
we had gone to.

921
00:53:59,152 --> 00:54:00,915
And the intelligence officer
wasn't coming inside...

922
00:54:00,987 --> 00:54:05,083
...and arresting us so that
he can arrest us later.

923
00:54:05,258 --> 00:54:08,386
What will he get by arresting us?

924
00:54:08,461 --> 00:54:09,758
Tell us.

925
00:54:10,130 --> 00:54:11,859
Tell us.

926
00:54:16,069 --> 00:54:17,536
That means you won't speak.

927
00:54:18,171 --> 00:54:19,365
Wilson.

928
00:54:27,347 --> 00:54:30,214
Did you remember anything
or forgot everything?

929
00:54:30,283 --> 00:54:31,545
I will tell you.

930
00:54:33,853 --> 00:54:34,945
I will tell you.

931
00:54:36,089 --> 00:54:41,117
We were keeping a watch on Lala
for a year.

932
00:54:43,463 --> 00:54:48,264
But I didn't have evidence
for searching his house.

933
00:54:51,137 --> 00:54:54,766
Few days ago my
informer informed me...

934
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:57,502
...that Lala is
planning to kill Khan...

935
00:54:58,979 --> 00:55:02,346
...along with the
other dons of Thailand.

936
00:55:02,782 --> 00:55:04,010
There are many Khans.

937
00:55:04,084 --> 00:55:05,449
Which Khan are you talking about?

938
00:55:05,518 --> 00:55:07,349
Thailand's most senior don.

939
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:08,751
Khan sir.

940
00:55:09,289 --> 00:55:13,123
Lala recorded all
the conversations...

941
00:55:15,762 --> 00:55:18,856
...that he had with
the dons of Thailand.

942
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:22,095
So that later if any don
doesn't want to support Lala...

943
00:55:22,135 --> 00:55:26,538
...then Lala can blackmail
them with their recorded voice.

944
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:28,874
Now I understand.

945
00:55:29,843 --> 00:55:34,007
That means the cassette
we found in Lala's safe...

946
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:39,074
...you wanted to use
that against Lala.

947
00:55:40,286 --> 00:55:43,278
Isn't that it?
- But why use us?

948
00:55:43,556 --> 00:55:46,923
I wanted Lala's tape
which was in his safe.

949
00:55:47,794 --> 00:55:50,888
That's why Batliwala
called from Mumbai.

950
00:55:50,964 --> 00:55:52,898
But why will the boss call you?

951
00:55:52,966 --> 00:55:54,058
I am there.

952
00:55:54,134 --> 00:55:58,264
Actually Batliwala's younger
brother is in Bangkok's jail.

953
00:56:01,408 --> 00:56:05,276
Batliwala's brother was
here to sell a painting.

954
00:56:05,845 --> 00:56:07,904
A painting of Mahatma
Buddha worth millions...

955
00:56:07,981 --> 00:56:10,245
...stolen from the Indian museum.

956
00:56:10,316 --> 00:56:12,011
Batliwala has painters...

957
00:56:12,085 --> 00:56:15,486
...who can make exact
copies of original paintings.

958
00:56:15,955 --> 00:56:19,152
When the duplicate copies
of the original is made...

959
00:56:19,225 --> 00:56:21,318
...then it is changed
with the real one...

960
00:56:21,394 --> 00:56:23,521
...with the help of
the security guard.

961
00:56:24,297 --> 00:56:27,061
The painting
stolen from the museum...

962
00:56:27,133 --> 00:56:30,967
...is sold to European
and American collectors.

963
00:56:31,037 --> 00:56:32,800
Speak, speak, go on.

964
00:56:33,273 --> 00:56:36,037
Batliwala wanted his brother and I...

965
00:56:37,077 --> 00:56:42,014
...wanted some foolish thieves
who could steal at Lala's house.

966
00:56:42,215 --> 00:56:45,184
That means sending us here to
steal was just a fake reason.

967
00:56:45,885 --> 00:56:48,353
Batliwala wanted his
brother released from the prison.

968
00:56:48,988 --> 00:56:51,149
And he wanted to
entrap us in exchange.

969
00:56:51,224 --> 00:56:53,852
Do we look like old
television or fridge...

970
00:56:54,461 --> 00:56:56,929
...which Batliwala sent
us for an exchange offer.

971
00:56:56,996 --> 00:56:59,760
You made a deal
and sealed our fates.

972
00:56:59,799 --> 00:57:01,460
Cut this nonsense.

973
00:57:01,734 --> 00:57:03,861
Take the goods and let's go.

974
00:57:03,937 --> 00:57:07,100
If you try to leave
with this cassette...

975
00:57:07,173 --> 00:57:10,836
...remember, that you won't be
able to get out of this room alive.

976
00:57:10,910 --> 00:57:12,468
Thanks for your concern.

977
00:57:12,846 --> 00:57:14,939
But we are too hot to
handle for your city.

978
00:57:20,053 --> 00:57:22,021
Everything's ruined.

979
00:57:22,522 --> 00:57:24,456
But why do you worry?

980
00:57:24,524 --> 00:57:28,358
You can easily find them with
the help of your department.

981
00:57:28,428 --> 00:57:31,795
Tanya, I cannot involve
the department in this.

982
00:57:31,998 --> 00:57:34,159
If the department finds out...

983
00:57:34,234 --> 00:57:35,428
...then those tapes
will become evidence.

984
00:57:35,502 --> 00:57:37,265
Please understand for God's sake.

985
00:57:37,904 --> 00:57:40,873
But, VP, the tapes are evidence.

986
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,405
That's why Batliwala...

987
00:57:42,475 --> 00:57:44,340
To hell with Batliwala.

988
00:57:44,911 --> 00:57:47,106
And to hell with everyone else.

989
00:57:47,914 --> 00:57:49,814
Those aren't normal tapes.

990
00:57:53,253 --> 00:57:56,916
Those tapes are goldmines for me.

991
00:57:57,490 --> 00:58:00,254
Do you know, Lala will pay
me millions for that tape...

992
00:58:00,326 --> 00:58:02,817
...and we can make millions?

993
00:58:05,865 --> 00:58:07,162
You are right.

994
00:58:07,233 --> 00:58:11,192
Tanya. There is another problem.

995
00:58:12,338 --> 00:58:13,896
What is the problem now?

996
00:58:13,973 --> 00:58:17,909
A lot of people know
about our plan now isn't it?

997
00:58:26,819 --> 00:58:27,911
VP.

998
00:58:30,223 --> 00:58:32,919
Then this shouldn't have
gone out of this room?

999
00:58:39,098 --> 00:58:40,156
You...

1000
00:58:41,501 --> 00:58:42,991
You are so right.

1001
00:58:43,169 --> 00:58:45,364
You are so right.

1002
00:58:45,438 --> 00:58:46,905
My, God.

1003
00:58:47,106 --> 00:58:48,300
Tanya, you are so right.

1004
00:58:48,374 --> 00:58:52,071
Sometimes you give
such great advice, dear.

1005
00:58:52,145 --> 00:58:54,909
Honestly, you just kill me...

1006
00:58:59,819 --> 00:59:02,151
The murderer has
found a good excuse...

1007
00:59:03,289 --> 00:59:05,723
...to deny his crime.

1008
00:59:08,127 --> 00:59:10,425
He asks everyone...

1009
00:59:11,898 --> 00:59:13,729
...who killed her.

1010
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:28,159
Greetings, Mr. Khan.
- Greetings. Take a seat.

1011
00:59:28,832 --> 00:59:31,357
What is wrong,
Lala? You look worried.

1012
00:59:31,435 --> 00:59:32,766
Is everything fine?

1013
00:59:32,836 --> 00:59:37,068
I... lost my
mother's voice, Mr. Khan.

1014
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:40,541
I am really sad to hear that.

1015
00:59:41,344 --> 00:59:43,744
Is your mother fine?
- Oh, no.

1016
00:59:44,314 --> 00:59:45,804
She died ages ago.

1017
00:59:47,517 --> 00:59:50,077
I... I didn't understand.

1018
00:59:51,555 --> 00:59:54,149
Last night, four Indians
barged inside my house...

1019
00:59:54,224 --> 00:59:55,657
...and tied me up.

1020
00:59:56,593 --> 00:59:58,788
Then they took away all the
audio cassettes in my locker...

1021
00:59:58,862 --> 01:00:02,298
...which contained my mother's voice.

1022
01:00:04,668 --> 01:00:06,693
I am not worried about
the money, Mr. Khan.

1023
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:10,797
But my... mother's voice...

1024
01:00:10,874 --> 01:00:13,138
Don't worry at all, Lala.

1025
01:00:14,478 --> 01:00:17,447
If those Indians are
still in the city...

1026
01:00:17,848 --> 01:00:20,783
...then we will recover
your mother's voice.

1027
01:00:21,218 --> 01:00:22,810
Isn't it, Munna?
- Yes, Mr. Khan.

1028
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:25,450
I will inform everyone right now.

1029
01:00:25,589 --> 01:00:27,386
What has the world come to?

1030
01:00:28,692 --> 01:00:31,354
Loot in a don's house.

1031
01:00:32,696 --> 01:00:35,096
That was my mother's
last insignia, Mr. Khan.

1032
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:37,123
You are still here, Munna.

1033
01:00:37,834 --> 01:00:39,597
I brought your DVD, 'Woh Kaun Thi'.

1034
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:41,627
Forget that, first
find out who they were?

1035
01:00:43,607 --> 01:00:45,131
Wilson.

1036
01:00:45,208 --> 01:00:46,505
Wilson, hurry up.

1037
01:00:47,143 --> 01:00:48,770
Look you fool.

1038
01:00:49,846 --> 01:00:51,746
Why are you wasting
your life in drugs?

1039
01:00:51,815 --> 01:00:53,282
It never benefited anyone?

1040
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:56,410
How long will you
keep wasting your life?

1041
01:00:56,686 --> 01:00:58,278
I have seen many like you.

1042
01:00:58,522 --> 01:01:00,149
Come to Mumbai, our hometown.

1043
01:01:00,190 --> 01:01:03,125
I will feed you meat,
liver, kidney...

1044
01:01:03,193 --> 01:01:06,424
...soup and get you in shape again.

1045
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:08,088
Carefully.

1046
01:01:08,164 --> 01:01:09,859
You won't come to Bangkok again.

1047
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:12,725
This is my address keep it.

1048
01:01:12,802 --> 01:01:14,599
And do call me when
you come to Mumbai.

1049
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:16,730
What are you searching for?
- Two minutes.

1050
01:01:16,806 --> 01:01:18,706
Even girls don't take so long.

1051
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:21,640
I can't find my underwear.

1052
01:01:21,711 --> 01:01:22,803
What is that lying there?

1053
01:01:23,079 --> 01:01:25,707
The circus tent.
- Thanks.

1054
01:01:26,216 --> 01:01:27,513
Take a look.

1055
01:01:27,584 --> 01:01:29,552
The entire underworld is after us.

1056
01:01:29,753 --> 01:01:31,448
We have to go underground.

1057
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:33,489
But he is searching
for his underwear.

1058
01:01:33,557 --> 01:01:35,320
Try to understand.

1059
01:01:35,492 --> 01:01:36,720
Understood.

1060
01:01:36,793 --> 01:01:40,092
That means we are going
to the airport now. - No.

1061
01:01:40,163 --> 01:01:42,427
Until we don't arrange
for fleeing from here...

1062
01:01:42,499 --> 01:01:44,057
...we will look for a place to hide.

1063
01:01:44,134 --> 01:01:46,261
And you go arrange for guns.

1064
01:01:46,336 --> 01:01:48,327
Because the problem
we are getting in...

1065
01:01:48,405 --> 01:01:49,463
...we have to make arrangements...

1066
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:51,302
...to save ourselves from it.

1067
01:01:51,474 --> 01:01:52,668
God save us from all this.

1068
01:01:52,742 --> 01:01:55,142
Let's go.
- Come on.

1069
01:01:55,412 --> 01:01:56,845
What language did he speak in?

1070
01:02:01,117 --> 01:02:02,277
There she is.
- Hi.

1071
01:02:02,352 --> 01:02:03,478
What's up?

1072
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:05,111
Hey, what's up?

1073
01:02:05,188 --> 01:02:06,485
Whose address do you want now?

1074
01:02:06,523 --> 01:02:07,649
Cheers.

1075
01:02:07,857 --> 01:02:09,119
We want guns?

1076
01:02:09,192 --> 01:02:10,250
Can we get it?

1077
01:02:10,327 --> 01:02:12,488
What will you do when you
run into Asif and Irfan?

1078
01:02:12,562 --> 01:02:13,620
Who are they?

1079
01:02:13,697 --> 01:02:15,665
Two lunatic goons of Pattaya.

1080
01:02:16,232 --> 01:02:18,700
Whose car you have stolen.

1081
01:02:20,036 --> 01:02:22,095
And we have heard that Lala's men...

1082
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:24,069
...are searching for four Indians.

1083
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:25,300
Why?

1084
01:02:25,609 --> 01:02:27,634
Do we need to carry Lala's bier?

1085
01:02:28,111 --> 01:02:29,305
Very funny?

1086
01:02:29,446 --> 01:02:32,210
You know Lala is the man who...

1087
01:02:32,282 --> 01:02:33,772
We don't have the time
to listen to your story?

1088
01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:35,108
Do you have guns?

1089
01:02:35,185 --> 01:02:37,449
It's a gun and not a bun...

1090
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:39,317
...which you can buy from the bakery.

1091
01:02:39,389 --> 01:02:40,754
We need to arrange for it.

1092
01:02:40,824 --> 01:02:42,758
Call me tomorrow.
- Get lost.

1093
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:44,754
Hey.

1094
01:02:45,562 --> 01:02:51,797
You could have told Asif,
Irfan and Lala's men about us.

1095
01:02:52,469 --> 01:02:53,595
So why didn't you?

1096
01:02:53,670 --> 01:02:56,332
We still...
- And not gossip.

1097
01:03:00,577 --> 01:03:02,477
Keep me posted about the
Indian girl's murder case.

1098
01:03:02,545 --> 01:03:03,603
Alright.
- Alright.

1099
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:04,840
Thank you so much.

1100
01:03:07,384 --> 01:03:08,817
Yes, Batliwala.

1101
01:03:09,085 --> 01:03:11,485
Did you get the tapes?
- No, not yet.

1102
01:03:11,554 --> 01:03:14,250
No. What happened?

1103
01:03:14,324 --> 01:03:17,418
Those four are acting too smart.

1104
01:03:17,494 --> 01:03:18,483
Meaning?

1105
01:03:18,561 --> 01:03:22,759
Meaning, they are not as
stupid as you think they are.

1106
01:03:23,266 --> 01:03:25,564
Mr. Singh, please do something.

1107
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:27,296
My brother is stuck there.

1108
01:03:27,370 --> 01:03:29,133
And you are sounding so relaxed.

1109
01:03:29,205 --> 01:03:30,536
Now don't panic.

1110
01:03:31,775 --> 01:03:33,402
I have made arrangements.

1111
01:03:34,044 --> 01:03:37,605
I will soon find the
tapes and those four.

1112
01:03:39,783 --> 01:03:41,148
Who are you?

1113
01:03:41,217 --> 01:03:42,241
What do you want?

1114
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:43,649
Where are your four Indian friends?

1115
01:03:44,721 --> 01:03:47,281
Where are your four Indian friends?

1116
01:03:47,624 --> 01:03:48,818
Tell me, otherwise I will shoot you.

1117
01:03:49,092 --> 01:03:50,354
Tell me, you rascal.

1118
01:03:50,427 --> 01:03:52,258
I don't know.
- What?

1119
01:03:52,328 --> 01:03:53,488
I don't know.

1120
01:03:53,563 --> 01:03:54,655
I don't...

1121
01:03:54,731 --> 01:03:56,699
They just gave me a card.

1122
01:03:58,435 --> 01:04:03,634
"Loot. Loot. Loot. Loot. Loot."

1123
01:04:06,242 --> 01:04:07,709
Akbar Qureshi.'

1124
01:04:09,345 --> 01:04:16,842
Phone
- 022-23301047... Mohammad Ali Road.

1125
01:04:17,654 --> 01:04:20,020
Yes, mother,
I am making a honest earning.

1126
01:04:20,523 --> 01:04:21,717
No, I am not preparing it myself.

1127
01:04:21,791 --> 01:04:23,156
It's a big hotel.

1128
01:04:23,226 --> 01:04:24,625
Day and night hotel.

1129
01:04:25,528 --> 01:04:27,621
We just call and say send
food to room number 1000...

1130
01:04:27,697 --> 01:04:29,562
...and they send it instantly.

1131
01:04:32,235 --> 01:04:33,702
Not 1000 rooms, mother...

1132
01:04:33,770 --> 01:04:36,466
...room number 1000. That's how
it is in these big hotels.

1133
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:37,597
Look after yourself.

1134
01:04:37,674 --> 01:04:39,505
Are you taking the physician's pill?

1135
01:04:39,576 --> 01:04:41,043
Look after the goats as well.

1136
01:04:41,111 --> 01:04:42,339
Goodbye.

1137
01:04:43,213 --> 01:04:45,477
Shoaib Akhtar has been
banned for five years.

1138
01:04:45,548 --> 01:04:47,743
Tell me news about Lalu in Bihar.

1139
01:04:47,817 --> 01:04:49,079
That's...

1140
01:04:49,152 --> 01:04:50,585
They are displaying
Wilson's photo on television.

1141
01:04:50,653 --> 01:04:51,711
Where? Where?

1142
01:04:51,788 --> 01:04:53,449
The police is looking for Wilson...

1143
01:04:53,490 --> 01:04:55,720
...in connection of the
murder of Tanya Sharma.

1144
01:04:55,792 --> 01:04:57,419
He is looking handsome.

1145
01:04:57,460 --> 01:04:59,428
They are talking
about Tanya's murder.

1146
01:04:59,496 --> 01:05:00,827
Murder.

1147
01:05:01,164 --> 01:05:02,256
Murder.

1148
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:06,497
They are connecting
us with the murder.

1149
01:05:06,569 --> 01:05:10,164
His gang are also wanted by
the police for questioning...

1150
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:12,140
...regarding the robbery last night...

1151
01:05:12,175 --> 01:05:15,611
...at the home of an alleged
Mafia member, Lala Bhatti.

1152
01:05:15,812 --> 01:05:17,837
Police has confirmed
that Wilson was seen...

1153
01:05:18,081 --> 01:05:20,743
...at the hotel by
the hotel receptionist.

1154
01:05:21,718 --> 01:05:22,742
So far.

1155
01:05:23,019 --> 01:05:25,419
So far the Pattaya police
have made no breakthrough...

1156
01:05:25,488 --> 01:05:27,388
...in finding the four suspects.

1157
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:40,360
This is not good.

1158
01:05:41,204 --> 01:05:43,297
I didn't want to come
here in the first place.

1159
01:05:44,574 --> 01:05:46,508
This Builder brought me here.

1160
01:05:47,811 --> 01:05:49,210
This is all your fault.

1161
01:05:49,279 --> 01:05:50,576
Don't point finger.

1162
01:05:50,647 --> 01:05:52,205
I am stuck here because of you.

1163
01:05:52,282 --> 01:05:53,579
We are stuck here as well.

1164
01:05:54,384 --> 01:05:56,477
They are displaying my
photo on the television.

1165
01:05:56,553 --> 01:05:58,180
You are fond of girls, after all.

1166
01:05:58,254 --> 01:06:00,154
Stop it now...
- That's enough.

1167
01:06:06,129 --> 01:06:10,828
We just pray to
God... that we don't lose our mind.

1168
01:06:11,367 --> 01:06:12,493
Explain that to this fool.

1169
01:06:12,569 --> 01:06:13,593
What do I explain to him?

1170
01:06:13,670 --> 01:06:15,160
I am looking for a chance myself.

1171
01:06:16,306 --> 01:06:17,796
My mother kept telling me.

1172
01:06:19,142 --> 01:06:21,042
You are a Pandit so become a priest.

1173
01:06:21,711 --> 01:06:23,178
Get people married.

1174
01:06:23,646 --> 01:06:24,738
Those who get married
will land in trouble...

1175
01:06:25,014 --> 01:06:26,106
...you don't bother.

1176
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:31,277
But I always wanted to make a gang.

1177
01:06:37,193 --> 01:06:38,251
Let's see what God
has in store for us.

1178
01:06:38,328 --> 01:06:39,727
I am praying.

1179
01:06:47,337 --> 01:06:49,066
What's up?
- How is it going?

1180
01:06:49,138 --> 01:06:50,264
Cool.

1181
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:52,365
Any news about my stolen car?

1182
01:06:53,343 --> 01:06:55,038
Haven't found out anything.

1183
01:06:55,712 --> 01:06:56,804
Why don't you go and meet Sunny?

1184
01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:59,344
Did you find out anything?
- No.

1185
01:06:59,616 --> 01:07:01,481
Then find them out, idiots.

1186
01:07:01,551 --> 01:07:02,711
Quickly.

1187
01:07:02,785 --> 01:07:05,049
Hello, aunt.

1188
01:07:05,421 --> 01:07:08,390
Yes, I am Suleman. Akbar's friend.

1189
01:07:08,791 --> 01:07:11,316
Actually, you had to send
the water of Zam-Zam for me.

1190
01:07:12,495 --> 01:07:14,156
Yes, yes, I know. I am in Pattaya.

1191
01:07:14,197 --> 01:07:16,188
No, no. We went to Pattaya together.

1192
01:07:16,266 --> 01:07:17,528
I live in Pattaya.

1193
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:19,363
I had to send you
the water of Zam-Zam.

1194
01:07:19,435 --> 01:07:20,629
In which hotel is he?

1195
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:22,170
A while ago.

1196
01:07:23,006 --> 01:07:24,337
Do you know where I can find him?

1197
01:07:24,674 --> 01:07:26,164
The taxi-driver.

1198
01:07:27,076 --> 01:07:28,475
Yes, four Indians.

1199
01:07:28,711 --> 01:07:31,009
Yes, I didn't go for Haj.

1200
01:07:31,781 --> 01:07:34,306
My... my mother went
for the Haj. Yes.

1201
01:07:34,384 --> 01:07:35,442
Yes.

1202
01:07:35,518 --> 01:07:37,543
Mother is absolutely fine.
By the grace of Allah.

1203
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:38,780
Yes.

1204
01:07:39,155 --> 01:07:41,783
No, Akbar... hasn't met mother.

1205
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:43,150
I...

1206
01:07:43,226 --> 01:07:46,491
I will introduce Akbar to her.
I will introduce Akbar to her.

1207
01:07:46,562 --> 01:07:48,052
In which hotel is he?

1208
01:07:48,131 --> 01:07:50,599
Yes, he is working at
the Day and Night Hotel.

1209
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:52,097
Day and Night Hotel.

1210
01:07:52,168 --> 01:07:53,226
Day and Night Hotel.

1211
01:07:53,303 --> 01:07:54,361
Day and Night Hotel.

1212
01:08:02,245 --> 01:08:03,405
Hello.

1213
01:08:03,479 --> 01:08:04,741
It was terrible, brother.

1214
01:08:05,148 --> 01:08:08,549
I still can't believe that someone
could dare to steal your car.

1215
01:08:09,652 --> 01:08:11,517
His photo was shown
on the television means...

1216
01:08:12,055 --> 01:08:13,386
...the police will be here soon.

1217
01:08:15,358 --> 01:08:17,292
Obviously, the police will be here.

1218
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:18,486
So what can they do?

1219
01:08:18,561 --> 01:08:22,122
Think about who will
pay the hotel rent?

1220
01:08:22,198 --> 01:08:24,530
I will call you as
soon as I get any news.

1221
01:08:26,135 --> 01:08:27,363
Goodbye.

1222
01:08:28,438 --> 01:08:29,735
Irfan.

1223
01:08:42,051 --> 01:08:43,109
What the...

1224
01:08:43,186 --> 01:08:44,619
Where did he come from?

1225
01:08:46,022 --> 01:08:47,182
Save us from this problem.

1226
01:08:47,256 --> 01:08:48,348
Save us from this problem.

1227
01:08:48,424 --> 01:08:49,789
Yes, Lala.

1228
01:08:50,059 --> 01:08:52,027
We have found those four Indians.

1229
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:53,187
I am going.

1230
01:08:53,262 --> 01:08:54,695
I will bring them to you.

1231
01:08:55,365 --> 01:08:56,730
How long can the goat
escape the blade?

1232
01:08:56,799 --> 01:08:58,699
Someday it will have
to face the blade.

1233
01:09:01,404 --> 01:09:02,496
I was first.
- Wait. Wait.

1234
01:09:02,572 --> 01:09:04,096
No, no, I was first.
- No, I want to call.

1235
01:09:04,173 --> 01:09:05,697
Cut, cut...
- Get lost.

1236
01:09:17,186 --> 01:09:18,551
The phone is ringing.

1237
01:09:18,621 --> 01:09:20,145
Death is getting closer.

1238
01:09:25,628 --> 01:09:27,220
The phone is ringing.

1239
01:09:27,430 --> 01:09:29,057
Why are you telling us?

1240
01:09:29,132 --> 01:09:30,599
Why don't you answer it?

1241
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:33,462
Answer the phone
before it's too late.

1242
01:09:35,505 --> 01:09:36,802
You are closer.

1243
01:09:37,073 --> 01:09:38,563
Don't you see I am cleaning the gun?

1244
01:09:38,641 --> 01:09:40,336
You are always cleaning the gun.

1245
01:09:41,144 --> 01:09:42,577
Do you ever use it?

1246
01:09:44,647 --> 01:09:45,739
I understand.

1247
01:09:45,815 --> 01:09:47,442
We are all doomed.

1248
01:09:47,483 --> 01:09:48,848
What are you doing?

1249
01:09:49,385 --> 01:09:52,081
What if it misfires?
- I will say sorry.

1250
01:09:55,158 --> 01:09:56,250
Nonsense.

1251
01:09:56,325 --> 01:09:58,156
Yes, who is it?
- Its me.

1252
01:09:58,227 --> 01:09:59,626
We are in a mess.

1253
01:09:59,695 --> 01:10:01,253
VP and Lala's men are coming up.

1254
01:10:01,330 --> 01:10:02,729
Get out of there, quickly.

1255
01:10:02,799 --> 01:10:05,495
They are coming to get us.

1256
01:10:05,568 --> 01:10:06,865
Get your stuff.

1257
01:10:07,103 --> 01:10:09,537
Where are my things?
- Where are you going, Pandit?

1258
01:10:09,605 --> 01:10:11,573
Will someone tell me
where the door is?

1259
01:10:11,641 --> 01:10:13,233
This way. This way.
- This way, Pandit.

1260
01:10:13,309 --> 01:10:14,469
Come on.
- Let's go.

1261
01:10:19,415 --> 01:10:21,713
V.B. Singh, is here.

1262
01:10:25,688 --> 01:10:27,656
Greetings, you...

1263
01:11:11,701 --> 01:11:14,568
Go, go, go.

1264
01:11:26,215 --> 01:11:27,409
Move.

1265
01:11:36,759 --> 01:11:38,158
Go.

1266
01:11:38,628 --> 01:11:39,788
This way.

1267
01:11:47,069 --> 01:11:48,730
What are you doing?

1268
01:11:48,804 --> 01:11:51,568
Where is the land?

1269
01:11:52,208 --> 01:11:54,836
Which floor did you
want us to jump from?

1270
01:12:12,528 --> 01:12:13,722
Come on.

1271
01:12:13,796 --> 01:12:15,696
You want to catch us.

1272
01:12:46,128 --> 01:12:47,823
Hurry up. Hurry up.

1273
01:12:49,565 --> 01:12:51,192
Hurry up.

1274
01:12:51,267 --> 01:12:53,565
Drive, drive.

1275
01:12:53,636 --> 01:12:54,728
Get out of here.

1276
01:12:54,804 --> 01:12:56,169
Quickly.

1277
01:12:59,508 --> 01:13:01,738
Abdul, everything is over.

1278
01:13:02,211 --> 01:13:04,736
Razaq, how will you
face the boss, now?

1279
01:13:06,682 --> 01:13:09,617
Hello,
- What happened?

1280
01:13:10,353 --> 01:13:11,547
Those four fled.

1281
01:13:12,555 --> 01:13:14,216
You came here to tell me that.

1282
01:13:15,491 --> 01:13:18,688
If they survived then you two won't.

1283
01:13:19,362 --> 01:13:20,659
Come on, get out.

1284
01:13:22,298 --> 01:13:25,631
But, boss, we haven't
eaten anything since morning.

1285
01:13:29,338 --> 01:13:30,498
You are hungry?

1286
01:13:35,077 --> 01:13:36,237
Was that enough?

1287
01:13:37,546 --> 01:13:41,209
Now better understand one thing.

1288
01:13:42,685 --> 01:13:46,086
If Munna finds those four first...

1289
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:49,580
...and Mr. Khan gets hold of
those cassettes before me.

1290
01:13:49,759 --> 01:13:51,090
Then we are in a mess.

1291
01:13:55,498 --> 01:13:57,466
Get lost.

1292
01:13:57,500 --> 01:13:58,694
Can I order one more?

1293
01:13:58,768 --> 01:14:00,827
Get lost you...
- Abdul, run.

1294
01:14:07,410 --> 01:14:08,843
Good for nothing.

1295
01:14:09,111 --> 01:14:11,306
Will you get the coffee
after making a milkshake?

1296
01:14:12,748 --> 01:14:14,545
Run, run.

1297
01:14:15,017 --> 01:14:16,143
Scoundrel.

1298
01:14:20,456 --> 01:14:22,014
You are absolutely right.

1299
01:14:22,458 --> 01:14:23,584
Great.

1300
01:14:33,602 --> 01:14:37,265
First you came to Pattaya
and then on television.

1301
01:14:37,340 --> 01:14:39,308
Right now we are on the streets.

1302
01:14:39,375 --> 01:14:44,074
Listen, we urgently need a place
to stay, guns and bullets.

1303
01:14:44,213 --> 01:14:47,512
Do you need the house first
or guns and bullets? - Both.

1304
01:14:48,050 --> 01:14:50,245
There are four of you, isn't it?
- So?

1305
01:14:50,753 --> 01:14:53,381
The police are looking
for four Indians.

1306
01:14:53,622 --> 01:14:56,284
I suggest that you two come with me.

1307
01:14:56,559 --> 01:14:59,551
And the other two can go with SMS.

1308
01:14:59,628 --> 01:15:00,754
Fine, let's go.

1309
01:15:00,830 --> 01:15:03,321
And this time the price
will be double? - Why double?

1310
01:15:03,466 --> 01:15:06,299
Because it's riskier
to be seen with you.

1311
01:15:06,369 --> 01:15:08,564
Stop it.
- Fine.

1312
01:15:09,438 --> 01:15:10,666
Fine, let's go.

1313
01:15:10,706 --> 01:15:12,105
Come.

1314
01:15:12,408 --> 01:15:14,137
"When someone's not that lucky."

1315
01:15:14,210 --> 01:15:16,770
"That's when a bell rings
in the mind."

1316
01:15:16,846 --> 01:15:18,780
"Even the Lord gives
him an exception."

1317
01:15:19,048 --> 01:15:21,209
"Go and loot who has abundance."

1318
01:15:21,283 --> 01:15:24,343
"Loot. Loot. Loot. Loot."

1319
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:53,272
Why is he screaming?

1320
01:15:53,349 --> 01:15:56,648
Seems like he is hard of hearing?

1321
01:15:57,153 --> 01:15:59,485
Will his gun work?
- Of course.

1322
01:16:04,193 --> 01:16:06,684
He says raise your
shirt he wants to check.

1323
01:16:12,301 --> 01:16:14,292
What is he saying now?

1324
01:16:14,370 --> 01:16:16,736
He is saying that we cannot
go inside with the gun.

1325
01:16:33,422 --> 01:16:35,049
Hey, listen, listen.

1326
01:16:35,124 --> 01:16:37,024
Cool, cool, cool.
What are you doing?

1327
01:16:37,092 --> 01:16:38,559
They come to buy. They come to buy.

1328
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:47,534
He is saying that you are
paying 50,000 for the guns...

1329
01:16:47,603 --> 01:16:50,094
...whereas Lala is
paying 400,000 for you.

1330
01:16:52,608 --> 01:16:54,803
He is saying that
you lower your guns.

1331
01:16:55,211 --> 01:16:56,542
Okay.

1332
01:16:57,413 --> 01:16:59,210
Okay. Cool.

1333
01:17:05,788 --> 01:17:07,255
He said I asked
you to keep it down...

1334
01:17:07,323 --> 01:17:08,790
...and not push it under the bed.

1335
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:25,532
What is he saying

1336
01:17:25,608 --> 01:17:26,666
You keep your gun down as well.

1337
01:17:26,742 --> 01:17:28,369
And no tricks.

1338
01:17:31,180 --> 01:17:32,442
Okay, okay.

1339
01:17:34,583 --> 01:17:35,641
Okay.

1340
01:17:35,718 --> 01:17:38,152
If you act foolishly
then we will all get killed.

1341
01:17:38,787 --> 01:17:40,687
If we act smart, we
can save ourselves.

1342
01:17:41,056 --> 01:17:42,216
Okay.

1343
01:17:43,592 --> 01:17:45,287
Wilson, divert his attention.

1344
01:17:46,362 --> 01:17:47,761
Okay, okay.

1345
01:17:49,565 --> 01:17:51,328
Quickly, get the bag.

1346
01:17:52,334 --> 01:17:53,596
What did you do?

1347
01:17:53,669 --> 01:17:55,660
Why did you kill him? Are you crazy?

1348
01:17:55,704 --> 01:17:57,171
Do you know who he is?

1349
01:17:57,239 --> 01:17:58,331
We will be in trouble.

1350
01:17:58,407 --> 01:17:59,465
We are going to be in big trouble.

1351
01:17:59,542 --> 01:18:00,668
We will see. Let's go.

1352
01:18:00,743 --> 01:18:02,176
Let's go quickly.

1353
01:18:14,123 --> 01:18:15,454
That's enough now.

1354
01:18:15,524 --> 01:18:16,650
What are you doing?

1355
01:18:16,725 --> 01:18:17,714
You have gone crazy?

1356
01:18:17,793 --> 01:18:19,158
First you stole
Asif and Irfan's car.

1357
01:18:19,228 --> 01:18:20,217
Then you committed
murder in Lala's house.

1358
01:18:20,296 --> 01:18:21,456
Killed that girl.

1359
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:23,555
We didn't kill that girl.
We have been framed.

1360
01:18:23,632 --> 01:18:25,190
You killed that Jong, didn't you?

1361
01:18:25,267 --> 01:18:26,734
What else could we have done?

1362
01:18:27,102 --> 01:18:28,535
He would have killed us otherwise.

1363
01:18:28,604 --> 01:18:30,231
You can commit
suicide here if you want.

1364
01:18:30,306 --> 01:18:31,466
Why are you involving me?

1365
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:34,236
We don't want to be
seen with you as well.

1366
01:18:34,777 --> 01:18:37,143
Do you want to stay here
until the police arrive?

1367
01:18:37,212 --> 01:18:38,270
Come on.

1368
01:18:38,347 --> 01:18:39,439
Taxi.

1369
01:18:39,515 --> 01:18:41,642
What has happened has happened?

1370
01:18:42,151 --> 01:18:43,516
Now think of a way
to get out of here.

1371
01:18:43,586 --> 01:18:46,077
The airport must have
been alerted as well.

1372
01:18:46,155 --> 01:18:47,417
There must be a way out.

1373
01:18:47,456 --> 01:18:49,583
Pardon me. There is no other way.

1374
01:18:49,658 --> 01:18:51,717
What do you mean by
pardon me? We aren't begging?

1375
01:18:53,529 --> 01:18:54,587
Take this money.

1376
01:18:54,663 --> 01:18:56,062
And find a way.

1377
01:18:56,198 --> 01:18:58,223
This is the last time. Nothing more.

1378
01:18:58,300 --> 01:18:59,790
You said that the last time as well.

1379
01:19:00,069 --> 01:19:03,095
We don't want to see you again.
- Fine.

1380
01:19:03,138 --> 01:19:04,469
We have a friend.

1381
01:19:04,540 --> 01:19:06,064
He lives here.

1382
01:19:06,275 --> 01:19:08,709
He can take you there on his ship.

1383
01:19:08,777 --> 01:19:11,041
But that is 100
kilometers from here.

1384
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:12,206
Fine, what is the problem?

1385
01:19:12,281 --> 01:19:15,114
We have a car.
- Don't create any more problems.

1386
01:19:15,184 --> 01:19:17,243
Asif and Irfan are
looking for the car.

1387
01:19:17,319 --> 01:19:19,253
I am...
- She is right.

1388
01:19:19,388 --> 01:19:24,382
If they see us then they will
kill us before we reach there.

1389
01:19:24,660 --> 01:19:27,254
We are already going
through a bad phase.

1390
01:19:27,529 --> 01:19:33,058
I suggest... we rent a car.

1391
01:19:33,402 --> 01:19:35,336
And take a ship.

1392
01:19:37,473 --> 01:19:39,634
We stole cars all our life, brother.

1393
01:19:40,275 --> 01:19:42,106
We used to accept money for cars.

1394
01:19:42,177 --> 01:19:44,407
For the first time we
are paying for a car.

1395
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:46,175
I don't like it.

1396
01:19:46,348 --> 01:19:49,579
Whether you like it or not, I don't
want to end up with a bullet.

1397
01:19:50,152 --> 01:19:52,120
They were shooting at us as if...

1398
01:19:52,187 --> 01:19:55,156
...our fathers had taken
a loan from their father...

1399
01:19:55,224 --> 01:19:56,452
...and didn't return it.
- Yes.

1400
01:20:07,736 --> 01:20:09,431
Excuse me.

1401
01:20:10,706 --> 01:20:12,435
Can we come in.

1402
01:20:16,178 --> 01:20:18,806
We want your car on rent.

1403
01:20:19,682 --> 01:20:22,150
Same, same.
- Yes, please wait.

1404
01:20:30,826 --> 01:20:33,590
Brother, this is why this
place is called Thailand.

1405
01:20:33,696 --> 01:20:35,095
What a huge thigh?

1406
01:20:35,397 --> 01:20:36,728
What a thigh.

1407
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:39,633
I really like her.

1408
01:20:40,335 --> 01:20:41,768
Hello.
- Hello, Chang.

1409
01:20:41,837 --> 01:20:43,498
Two Indians have come
to rent a car.

1410
01:20:43,572 --> 01:20:44,732
Two Indians.

1411
01:20:45,340 --> 01:20:46,568
Can you hold them for a while?

1412
01:20:46,608 --> 01:20:50,374
Yes, I can hold them for a while.
- Yeah, I am coming.

1413
01:20:52,614 --> 01:20:54,479
I admit that I was
slightly unjust to you

1414
01:20:54,516 --> 01:20:55,608
Slightly.

1415
01:20:55,684 --> 01:20:59,085
I will have to keep
this plaster for a month.

1416
01:21:00,589 --> 01:21:04,218
I shouldn't have treated my
younger brother so harshly.

1417
01:21:05,260 --> 01:21:07,820
That is why...
- Pardoning my debt.

1418
01:21:08,197 --> 01:21:10,324
Are you crazy?

1419
01:21:11,366 --> 01:21:12,833
A debt is a debt.

1420
01:21:14,103 --> 01:21:15,468
I thought that once
you get discharged...

1421
01:21:15,537 --> 01:21:17,402
...you can come and give
me a hand at the café.

1422
01:21:17,573 --> 01:21:19,040
It will take care of your debt.

1423
01:21:19,108 --> 01:21:21,633
I need a hand to give you a hand.

1424
01:21:21,777 --> 01:21:24,245
Manage it with what
you have left. Useless.

1425
01:21:24,313 --> 01:21:26,281
Greetings, boss.
- Greetings.

1426
01:21:27,082 --> 01:21:28,777
Gollu, it was just duty.

1427
01:21:29,418 --> 01:21:30,715
We have found the Indians.

1428
01:21:32,121 --> 01:21:33,349
I will be back soon.

1429
01:21:33,489 --> 01:21:34,615
Let's go.

1430
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:39,752
Isn't he taking too long?

1431
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:46,090
I am scared.

1432
01:21:46,168 --> 01:21:47,499
Let's go.
- Come on.

1433
01:21:47,770 --> 01:21:51,831
Strange, he is taking so long.

1434
01:21:52,541 --> 01:21:54,202
Why isn't he giving us?

1435
01:21:54,710 --> 01:21:56,644
Something is surely wrong?

1436
01:21:57,646 --> 01:21:59,841
Something is wrong.

1437
01:22:00,115 --> 01:22:03,141
But where is he?
- Lala.

1438
01:22:04,153 --> 01:22:06,144
He is waving at us.
Don't let him catch us.

1439
01:23:24,766 --> 01:23:28,293
I am shot, Pandit.

1440
01:23:58,734 --> 01:24:01,100
Hang on.

1441
01:24:08,110 --> 01:24:10,078
Builder!

1442
01:25:05,767 --> 01:25:08,702
Pandit. It wasn't your mistake.

1443
01:25:18,080 --> 01:25:20,640
We should've listened to Lala.

1444
01:25:20,716 --> 01:25:24,743
Who knew that
Batliwala is sending us here...

1445
01:25:25,087 --> 01:25:28,181
No, to get us killed.

1446
01:25:28,256 --> 01:25:30,349
Who can kill us?

1447
01:25:31,026 --> 01:25:36,760
We will first take care of
the one who sent us here.

1448
01:25:37,399 --> 01:25:39,230
We will take care
of Batliwala later.

1449
01:25:40,669 --> 01:25:43,502
First we should get that
VP Singh and that Lala.

1450
01:25:43,705 --> 01:25:45,138
We will.

1451
01:25:45,774 --> 01:25:47,207
We will kill everyone.

1452
01:25:48,276 --> 01:25:50,540
And we will kill them in a way...

1453
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:56,517
...that they will keep
wondering who killed us.

1454
01:25:58,487 --> 01:26:00,045
We will.

1455
01:26:00,355 --> 01:26:01,583
We will.

1456
01:26:01,656 --> 01:26:03,248
Locking horns with us.

1457
01:26:04,659 --> 01:26:06,058
Yes, boss.

1458
01:26:07,596 --> 01:26:09,188
In Pattaya, where else.

1459
01:26:10,799 --> 01:26:12,391
We cannot tell you, boss.

1460
01:26:13,602 --> 01:26:16,332
There are many people
after us in Pattaya.

1461
01:26:16,671 --> 01:26:18,366
I will call you later.

1462
01:26:20,675 --> 01:26:22,040
Pandit.

1463
01:26:22,677 --> 01:26:25,237
That rascal Batliwala is in Pattaya.

1464
01:26:25,313 --> 01:26:26,371
How do you know?

1465
01:26:26,415 --> 01:26:28,542
I could hear the police sirens.

1466
01:26:28,617 --> 01:26:32,018
That means he is with Mr.
Singh right now.

1467
01:26:32,087 --> 01:26:36,319
Singh sir, I feel they doubt me.

1468
01:26:44,399 --> 01:26:46,264
That is not possible.

1469
01:26:46,701 --> 01:26:49,568
Just find out where they are.

1470
01:26:50,172 --> 01:26:54,040
Once I get the cassettes
then you will get your brother.

1471
01:26:54,376 --> 01:26:57,402
So Singh wants the
cassette and we want Singh.

1472
01:26:57,579 --> 01:27:00,548
Wilson, call Singh.

1473
01:27:24,072 --> 01:27:28,304
How long can the
fish hide in the water?

1474
01:27:31,213 --> 01:27:34,046
You finally realized that...

1475
01:27:34,282 --> 01:27:36,477
...your benefit lies in meeting me.

1476
01:27:37,052 --> 01:27:40,112
Look, I have no
connection with these incidents.

1477
01:27:40,455 --> 01:27:42,184
I was having a good time in Mumbai.

1478
01:27:42,324 --> 01:27:43,552
And here I am in the 'wanted' list.

1479
01:27:43,592 --> 01:27:44,684
I just want to get out of here.

1480
01:27:44,759 --> 01:27:46,750
Where are the tapes?
- What will I get in return?

1481
01:27:47,028 --> 01:27:49,326
There can't be any murder
case without the murder weapon.

1482
01:27:49,431 --> 01:27:50,591
Murder weapon?

1483
01:27:50,765 --> 01:27:53,427
Where is that?
- With me.

1484
01:27:53,602 --> 01:27:58,198
That lamp which has
your finger prints.

1485
01:28:04,246 --> 01:28:06,043
Did you forget?

1486
01:28:07,282 --> 01:28:08,544
Remember now.

1487
01:28:10,118 --> 01:28:12,313
When you get the tapes call me, bye.

1488
01:28:14,556 --> 01:28:15,648
Pandit, will he fall for it.

1489
01:28:15,724 --> 01:28:18,158
My enemies always fall for it.

1490
01:28:19,694 --> 01:28:20,752
Where are the tapes?

1491
01:28:21,029 --> 01:28:22,121
Where is the lamp?

1492
01:28:30,272 --> 01:28:31,364
Fine.

1493
01:28:33,275 --> 01:28:35,766
Sit. Let me check.

1494
01:28:36,545 --> 01:28:37,603
Let me check.

1495
01:28:37,679 --> 01:28:39,044
Check the lamp.

1496
01:28:48,089 --> 01:28:49,386
Hello, Mustaq.
- Yes, brother.

1497
01:28:49,524 --> 01:28:50,616
How are you?
- I am fine.

1498
01:28:50,692 --> 01:28:52,557
What have you
thought about Khan sir?

1499
01:28:52,727 --> 01:28:56,185
The old man's
already nearing his death.

1500
01:28:56,264 --> 01:28:57,731
You can go.

1501
01:28:58,433 --> 01:29:00,458
That old man is the problem.

1502
01:29:07,209 --> 01:29:08,335
Give me the bag. Give me the bag.

1503
01:29:08,410 --> 01:29:10,469
Come on, run.

1504
01:29:11,112 --> 01:29:13,046
Thief. Please catch him.

1505
01:29:13,248 --> 01:29:15,148
Hey, stop it.

1506
01:29:19,154 --> 01:29:20,348
Rascal.

1507
01:29:32,500 --> 01:29:33,626
Shall we, Pandit?

1508
01:29:33,702 --> 01:29:35,499
I can't see people stealing.

1509
01:29:35,637 --> 01:29:36,797
I am an expert myself.

1510
01:29:36,838 --> 01:29:38,396
I cannot see anyone else.

1511
01:29:42,744 --> 01:29:44,211
Stop it.

1512
01:30:01,363 --> 01:30:02,489
Rascal.

1513
01:30:13,742 --> 01:30:15,107
Hello.

1514
01:30:16,378 --> 01:30:19,643
Lala's... café.

1515
01:30:20,148 --> 01:30:22,446
Hey, old man.

1516
01:30:22,517 --> 01:30:24,246
Give me the phone. Hello.

1517
01:30:24,452 --> 01:30:25,714
Lala.
- Yes.

1518
01:30:25,787 --> 01:30:28,051
If you want the cassettes it
will cost you? - How much?

1519
01:30:28,223 --> 01:30:30,748
Nine crores.
- Are you crazy?

1520
01:30:30,825 --> 01:30:36,695
If Khan hears these tapes then
he will surely go crazy, Lala.

1521
01:30:51,112 --> 01:30:56,448
Either you are very
brave or very foolish.

1522
01:30:56,685 --> 01:30:58,175
We got stuck in this
due to foolishness...

1523
01:30:58,253 --> 01:31:00,448
...now we want to get out bravely.

1524
01:31:01,823 --> 01:31:03,347
I have to admit.

1525
01:31:07,495 --> 01:31:09,656
I have to admit they are brave.

1526
01:31:14,669 --> 01:31:18,765
You know that Lala is my man.

1527
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:23,443
Khan sir, you decide
after hearing this tape...

1528
01:31:25,680 --> 01:31:27,307
...whose man Lala is.

1529
01:31:42,063 --> 01:31:43,223
Hello, Mustaq.
- Yes, brother.

1530
01:31:43,298 --> 01:31:44,697
How are you?
- I am fine.

1531
01:31:44,766 --> 01:31:47,166
What have you thought
about Khan sir? - As you say?

1532
01:31:47,235 --> 01:31:49,795
The old man's
already nearing his death.

1533
01:31:50,071 --> 01:31:52,062
With your help I can
send him into his grave.

1534
01:31:52,140 --> 01:31:55,109
If there's a problem...
- That old man is the problem.

1535
01:31:55,243 --> 01:31:57,211
Once we get him out of the way...

1536
01:31:57,278 --> 01:31:59,269
...then there won't be any problem.

1537
01:32:00,081 --> 01:32:02,208
But... but...
- Why are you scared?

1538
01:32:02,283 --> 01:32:04,808
I have spoken to Swan,
Lee and Liakat.

1539
01:32:05,153 --> 01:32:06,313
They are with me.

1540
01:32:06,354 --> 01:32:08,515
Once Mr. Khan is out of the way...

1541
01:32:08,590 --> 01:32:10,182
...then all of Thailand's
business will be ours.

1542
01:32:10,258 --> 01:32:13,091
So, are you with
us or with Khan sir?

1543
01:32:13,161 --> 01:32:14,560
I have always been with you.

1544
01:32:21,403 --> 01:32:23,166
What do you want?

1545
01:32:23,605 --> 01:32:25,505
Safe passage to our country.

1546
01:32:26,074 --> 01:32:28,304
And...
- Revenge from Batliwala.

1547
01:32:29,210 --> 01:32:31,144
Our boss who framed us.

1548
01:32:31,746 --> 01:32:33,509
And he is in Pattaya right now.

1549
01:32:35,617 --> 01:32:36,777
It will be done.

1550
01:32:39,487 --> 01:32:41,614
But what else will I get in return?

1551
01:32:41,723 --> 01:32:45,386
Some more evidence
and our good wishes.

1552
01:33:06,648 --> 01:33:09,549
Where did you get it from?
- The cassette shop.

1553
01:33:11,719 --> 01:33:12,845
First the money.

1554
01:33:20,028 --> 01:33:22,292
First play it.
- Yes.

1555
01:34:11,846 --> 01:34:13,541
When he came in limping...

1556
01:34:14,549 --> 01:34:17,211
...I knew he won't make it too far.

1557
01:34:19,554 --> 01:34:23,217
But, boss, you have to
admit it's a good song.

1558
01:34:24,626 --> 01:34:26,150
I danced a lot to this
song when I was young.

1559
01:34:26,227 --> 01:34:27,785
Me too, boss. Like this.

1560
01:34:30,365 --> 01:34:31,662
Shall we go?

1561
01:34:31,733 --> 01:34:35,066
Actually, I was
recalling my handsome young days.

1562
01:34:39,741 --> 01:34:42,608
Brother, I don't think
our car has been stolen.

1563
01:34:43,211 --> 01:34:44,439
Then where is it?

1564
01:34:44,512 --> 01:34:47,447
Maybe the traffic
police towed it away.

1565
01:34:48,216 --> 01:34:49,410
Traffic police?

1566
01:34:49,484 --> 01:34:50,678
Remember lqbal.

1567
01:34:50,752 --> 01:34:52,242
His car was towed away too.

1568
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:54,584
To hell with lqbal.
- Yes, brother.

1569
01:34:54,722 --> 01:34:57,316
If you say anything without
my permission. - Yes, brother.

1570
01:34:57,392 --> 01:34:58,552
Then I will kill you right here.

1571
01:34:58,626 --> 01:35:00,287
Understand?
- Yes, brother.

1572
01:35:11,706 --> 01:35:14,436
Brother, can I order for a burger?
- Quiet.

1573
01:35:14,509 --> 01:35:16,272
I...
- I told you.

1574
01:35:16,578 --> 01:35:18,375
I am hungry. - Don't say
anything without my permission.

1575
01:35:18,446 --> 01:35:19,572
I am hungry.

1576
01:35:20,148 --> 01:35:21,740
You won't die if you
don't eat for a day.

1577
01:35:28,556 --> 01:35:31,423
Hey. Get going. Come on.

1578
01:35:33,394 --> 01:35:36,227
If you say anything
without my permission.

1579
01:35:36,297 --> 01:35:37,321
Then I will kill you right here.

1580
01:35:37,398 --> 01:35:39,059
Understand?

1581
01:35:41,102 --> 01:35:43,229
Come on.
- Move.

1582
01:35:46,040 --> 01:35:47,098
Irfan.

1583
01:35:47,675 --> 01:35:48,801
What do you think?

1584
01:35:49,310 --> 01:35:52,302
Will we find the car? - I don't
think we will find the car now.

1585
01:36:06,294 --> 01:36:07,761
Gollu.
- Yes.

1586
01:36:08,396 --> 01:36:10,159
Congratulations.

1587
01:36:11,232 --> 01:36:12,631
Who are you two?

1588
01:36:13,468 --> 01:36:15,368
We are the lottery people.

1589
01:36:15,703 --> 01:36:17,261
We are from the hospital.

1590
01:36:17,605 --> 01:36:18,731
You have won a lottery, sir.

1591
01:36:19,007 --> 01:36:21,601
But I didn't buy any lottery.

1592
01:36:21,676 --> 01:36:25,510
Sir, the lottery that
you won cannot be brought.

1593
01:36:26,147 --> 01:36:30,049
We put every
patient's name in a box.

1594
01:36:31,185 --> 01:36:34,416
This month your name was picked.

1595
01:36:34,656 --> 01:36:36,681
Lucky draw, sir.
- I didn't understand.

1596
01:36:37,191 --> 01:36:39,125
I will explain to you.
Do you see that car?

1597
01:36:40,094 --> 01:36:41,288
Yes.

1598
01:36:41,362 --> 01:36:43,330
It's yours, you won it.

1599
01:36:44,132 --> 01:36:47,465
Really? - If I lie then may
I see your brother's dead face.

1600
01:36:48,536 --> 01:36:50,128
Nothing.

1601
01:36:50,471 --> 01:36:52,234
Your car keys.

1602
01:36:53,775 --> 01:36:55,208
Gollu.

1603
01:36:55,376 --> 01:36:58,402
Gollu useless has
become Gollu the car owner.

1604
01:37:05,219 --> 01:37:07,312
Lala, to hell with you.

1605
01:37:14,529 --> 01:37:15,723
Brother.

1606
01:37:16,230 --> 01:37:19,063
How is it?
- What is it?

1607
01:37:19,200 --> 01:37:21,691
Car.
- Really.

1608
01:37:22,136 --> 01:37:23,330
I thought it's an elephant.

1609
01:37:23,604 --> 01:37:26,004
Brother, someone gifted it to me.

1610
01:37:26,074 --> 01:37:27,564
I want to give it to you.

1611
01:37:28,142 --> 01:37:29,234
What should I do with it?

1612
01:37:29,310 --> 01:37:32,245
If you sell this, it
will fetch some money.

1613
01:37:32,447 --> 01:37:34,415
It will lessen my debt.

1614
01:37:37,218 --> 01:37:38,378
Okay.

1615
01:37:38,786 --> 01:37:40,344
And... listen.

1616
01:37:41,622 --> 01:37:43,180
You look fine.

1617
01:37:43,591 --> 01:37:45,422
Come to work from tomorrow,
- Okay.

1618
01:37:45,493 --> 01:37:46,687
Go on.

1619
01:37:54,202 --> 01:37:57,535
So, have you lost your way?

1620
01:37:57,805 --> 01:38:00,205
Or are you trying to cross our path?

1621
01:38:00,742 --> 01:38:03,233
I am not trying to cross your path.

1622
01:38:03,511 --> 01:38:05,479
I am here to show you the path.

1623
01:38:05,780 --> 01:38:07,213
Meaning?

1624
01:38:07,582 --> 01:38:11,177
2I mean... I know where your car is.

1625
01:38:20,294 --> 01:38:21,556
Give me one too.

1626
01:38:39,747 --> 01:38:43,444
Where are you going?
- Brother... with you...

1627
01:38:43,518 --> 01:38:45,008
You stay right here.

1628
01:38:45,653 --> 01:38:49,111
Until I don't come out,
stay in the car. - Inside.

1629
01:39:06,707 --> 01:39:09,141
There is a red car parked outside.

1630
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:14,277
Will someone tell me whose it is?

1631
01:39:16,384 --> 01:39:17,578
Mine.

1632
01:39:18,052 --> 01:39:19,451
That car is mine.

1633
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:21,044
That's exactly what
I said, young man.

1634
01:39:21,122 --> 01:39:22,453
That's my car.

1635
01:39:28,362 --> 01:39:30,796
I will take that car along.

1636
01:39:31,766 --> 01:39:36,226
But not without killing
the man who brought it here.

1637
01:39:36,504 --> 01:39:37,766
Forget about the car.

1638
01:39:39,307 --> 01:39:42,333
And if you want to leave
alive then get lost, come on.

1639
01:39:42,410 --> 01:39:45,311
First handover the
car keys, quietly.

1640
01:39:45,346 --> 01:39:48,338
Why you...
- Quiet, you...

1641
01:40:31,659 --> 01:40:32,751
Bullets. Bullets.

1642
01:41:41,128 --> 01:41:45,155
"These are the people
who snatched my veil."

1643
01:42:03,784 --> 01:42:05,615
Mr. Khan, those four are here.

1644
01:42:06,721 --> 01:42:08,382
How many times have I told you...

1645
01:42:08,456 --> 01:42:11,584
...not to disturb me when
I am watching 'Pakeeza'.

1646
01:42:12,660 --> 01:42:14,651
Fine, send them in.
- Yes.

1647
01:42:22,203 --> 01:42:23,431
Hello, Don.

1648
01:42:23,471 --> 01:42:24,369
Greeting, Mr. Khan.

1649
01:42:24,438 --> 01:42:26,338
Good afternoon, sir.
- Greetings.

1650
01:42:30,344 --> 01:42:33,177
Great.

1651
01:42:35,316 --> 01:42:38,114
There has never been a heroine
like Meena Kumari.

1652
01:42:38,552 --> 01:42:41,316
We came here to
give you the cassette.

1653
01:42:42,189 --> 01:42:44,783
Anything else?
- Batliwala?

1654
01:42:45,059 --> 01:42:45,821
It will be done.

1655
01:42:46,060 --> 01:42:47,288
And yes.

1656
01:42:48,596 --> 01:42:50,621
After you return to India...

1657
01:42:51,632 --> 01:42:54,601
...send me a DVD of
'Yehudi' and 'Baiju Bawra'.

1658
01:42:55,569 --> 01:42:56,627
Go.

1659
01:42:56,670 --> 01:42:57,534
Thank you, sir.

1660
01:42:57,605 --> 01:42:59,596
See you.
- Good bye.

1661
01:43:01,409 --> 01:43:05,505
Great. Great.

1662
01:43:12,787 --> 01:43:13,685
Builder.

1663
01:43:13,754 --> 01:43:15,813
You didn't tell me
that you are in Pattaya.

1664
01:43:17,691 --> 01:43:19,090
I was about to tell you?

1665
01:43:19,160 --> 01:43:20,388
Now I will tell you.

1666
01:43:20,461 --> 01:43:21,450
If you want the tapes...

1667
01:43:21,529 --> 01:43:25,522
...then get two crores and
come to Pattaya Pier by 5:30.

1668
01:43:25,599 --> 01:43:28,261
What? Two crores.

1669
01:43:29,070 --> 01:43:32,130
How will I...
- Get it in a bag.

1670
01:44:19,253 --> 01:44:21,016
So you finally showed your colors.

1671
01:44:21,555 --> 01:44:22,681
My brother was in trouble.

1672
01:44:22,756 --> 01:44:24,519
And we can never be in trouble?

1673
01:44:27,128 --> 01:44:28,618
You could have said it once, boss.

1674
01:44:30,097 --> 01:44:31,758
I would have brought
your brother back.

1675
01:44:32,733 --> 01:44:34,132
What man?

1676
01:44:34,602 --> 01:44:36,593
You were trying to get us arrested.

1677
01:44:37,471 --> 01:44:39,701
I was even shot, boss.

1678
01:44:41,542 --> 01:44:42,804
I regret.

1679
01:44:44,512 --> 01:44:49,643
I regret that I was
working for a man like you.

1680
01:44:50,818 --> 01:44:52,115
Where are the cassettes?

1681
01:44:52,186 --> 01:44:54,780
Show us the money and
you will see the tapes?

1682
01:45:15,809 --> 01:45:17,640
Look.

1683
01:45:18,379 --> 01:45:19,539
Notes on the top.

1684
01:45:20,147 --> 01:45:21,478
And plain paper below.

1685
01:45:22,383 --> 01:45:24,510
The fraud.
- Forget it.

1686
01:45:25,119 --> 01:45:28,577
Today this fraud will to go God.

1687
01:45:29,089 --> 01:45:30,386
Take a look.

1688
01:45:35,563 --> 01:45:36,689
Let's go.

1689
01:45:44,238 --> 01:45:45,671
Who are you?
- Munna.

1690
01:45:46,540 --> 01:45:49,373
Khan sir has sent me
to settle the score...

1691
01:45:49,810 --> 01:45:53,712
...on behalf of the four
Indians you tried to frame.

1692
01:45:54,114 --> 01:45:55,206
Khan sir?

1693
01:45:57,451 --> 01:46:00,716
Look, is anything possible?

1694
01:46:01,522 --> 01:46:03,183
Like compromise?

1695
01:46:13,667 --> 01:46:15,157
Batliwala is dead.

1696
01:46:15,703 --> 01:46:17,170
And we lost our money as well.

1697
01:46:17,238 --> 01:46:20,332
Yes, yes, but Wilson is safe.

1698
01:46:21,141 --> 01:46:25,271
By the way, you are the
root of all the problems.

1699
01:46:26,080 --> 01:46:27,069
How me?

1700
01:46:27,147 --> 01:46:28,011
"How?"

1701
01:46:28,082 --> 01:46:29,174
You are the one responsible.

1702
01:46:29,250 --> 01:46:30,217
And now that you are
caught red-handed, you deny.

1703
01:46:30,284 --> 01:46:32,445
Why don't you throw
Tanya's bag in the sea?

1704
01:46:32,486 --> 01:46:34,579
Don't touch it, Pandit.

1705
01:46:34,655 --> 01:46:36,646
Why? Why can't we touch it?

1706
01:46:37,157 --> 01:46:39,125
Are you missing Tanya?

1707
01:46:39,193 --> 01:46:40,785
Are you missing Tanya?
- Leave it.

1708
01:46:41,061 --> 01:46:42,119
Leave it.
- I won't.

1709
01:46:42,196 --> 01:46:44,061
Leave it.

1710
01:46:58,412 --> 01:46:59,777
What is this?

1711
01:47:01,815 --> 01:47:03,282
Painting.

1712
01:47:04,418 --> 01:47:07,785
Batliwala's brother was
here to sell a painting.

1713
01:47:08,055 --> 01:47:10,683
A painting of Mahatma Buddha
stolen from the Indian museum...

1714
01:47:10,758 --> 01:47:12,282
...worth millions.

1715
01:47:12,359 --> 01:47:14,418
And the paintings
stolen from the museum...

1716
01:47:14,495 --> 01:47:18,056
...is sold to Arabian
and American private collectors.

1717
01:47:18,132 --> 01:47:21,101
This is the same painting
worth millions.

1718
01:47:21,435 --> 01:47:23,062
Tanya is dead.

1719
01:47:23,137 --> 01:47:26,106
But she left behind
