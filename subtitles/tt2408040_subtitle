1
00:03:30,323 --> 00:03:34,885
A post funeral ceremony
(religious verses in Punjabi)

2
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,241
Losing both your parents in an
accident seemed like a conspiracy.

3
00:04:33,853 --> 00:04:38,449
lt was just that
l had no one to blame for it.

4
00:05:09,856 --> 00:05:10,845
Chhoti.

5
00:05:28,008 --> 00:05:29,600
No need to make any more tea.

6
00:05:32,612 --> 00:05:36,070
Are they to mourn or...?

7
00:05:37,283 --> 00:05:39,979
lt's only close family now.

8
00:05:40,053 --> 00:05:41,714
Grandpa, aunt and ...

9
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:46,682
Chhoti is crying in the
bathroom go give her some water.

10
00:05:46,993 --> 00:05:48,392
l'll take the tea.

11
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:54,698
Till the time he
completes his college..

12
00:05:54,801 --> 00:05:56,359
..Mukesh will stay with you.

13
00:05:57,837 --> 00:06:00,305
Father-in-law,
l have a touring job.

14
00:06:01,174 --> 00:06:03,199
Your daughter runs the house.

15
00:06:04,911 --> 00:06:09,280
l will abide by
whatever you two decide.

16
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,480
Papaji, we never dared to
have a second child of our own.

17
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:22,219
We have neither the
space nor the means...

18
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:25,225
Nothing is hidden from you.

19
00:06:26,332 --> 00:06:27,492
He is like my own son.

20
00:06:27,867 --> 00:06:29,892
But, how can l take
his responsibility?

21
00:06:29,969 --> 00:06:31,266
l understand...

22
00:06:33,773 --> 00:06:35,741
lt was my son's age
to take responsibility.

23
00:06:35,942 --> 00:06:39,275
But instead he has
left me with his share too.

24
00:06:42,048 --> 00:06:44,539
Don't worry, l will take
care of any extra expenses bourne

25
00:06:45,552 --> 00:06:48,453
by you from my pension fund.

26
00:06:53,693 --> 00:06:56,161
But, his is a responsibility
we all must share.

27
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:15,539
l am not going to Delhi.
l am going to stay here.

28
00:07:16,349 --> 00:07:18,283
And take care of Sonu and Chhoti.

29
00:08:45,371 --> 00:08:46,599
Bring me some butter.

30
00:08:47,807 --> 00:08:48,865
Coming!

31
00:08:57,183 --> 00:08:58,514
No breakfast, Mukesh?

32
00:08:58,885 --> 00:09:00,910
College must have already started.

33
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:06,215
Eats enough... free loader!

34
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:15,631
'l was offered the most
pedestrian course in college.'

35
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:25,234
'B.A Pass.'

36
00:10:21,901 --> 00:10:23,732
Why are you standing on my head!

37
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:25,301
Want to inhale the smoke?

38
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:28,170
What do you want?

39
00:10:29,108 --> 00:10:30,939
You are always
in need of something.

40
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:32,871
Aunt...l need some money.

41
00:10:33,579 --> 00:10:34,637
To get fliers printed.

42
00:10:34,814 --> 00:10:36,145
l am thinking of giving
private tuition to school kids.

43
00:10:36,249 --> 00:10:37,944
Will return the money
as soon as l get the job.

44
00:10:38,151 --> 00:10:41,382
No harm dreaming.

45
00:10:44,824 --> 00:10:46,223
But what if you don't
get the tuitions?

46
00:10:46,426 --> 00:10:48,553
Your grandfather does
not send us a fortune!

47
00:10:50,697 --> 00:10:53,063
No point wasting
money on silly schemes.

48
00:11:13,086 --> 00:11:16,055
Don't you know a chess board attracts
evil spirits with scores to settle.

49
00:11:21,561 --> 00:11:22,858
Wait! Let me search your bag!

50
00:11:23,062 --> 00:11:24,620
Why? Am l a thief?

51
00:11:24,864 --> 00:11:26,832
Kid, this is Delhi!
Here everyone is a thief!

52
00:11:27,834 --> 00:11:30,598
On a good day you get robbed.

53
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:33,332
On bad days you get killed
first and then robbed.

54
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,429
Kasparov.

55
00:11:38,878 --> 00:11:40,937
Wipe that innocent
look off your face!

56
00:11:41,614 --> 00:11:43,275
l catch coffin thieves
like you everyday.

57
00:11:45,852 --> 00:11:47,444
Hey! Stop!

58
00:11:49,822 --> 00:11:51,050
What have you stolen?

59
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:53,315
Must have stolen something?

60
00:11:53,593 --> 00:11:54,582
What?

61
00:11:54,994 --> 00:11:57,622
A corpse's gold tooth?
A diamond ring maybe?

62
00:12:00,933 --> 00:12:02,628
Come...follow me.

63
00:12:06,873 --> 00:12:09,637
Pious! Need an extra
day to make one box?

64
00:12:09,709 --> 00:12:11,643
He is the one Johnny bhai!

65
00:12:11,711 --> 00:12:15,078
Always loitering around
with a chess board!

66
00:12:15,848 --> 00:12:17,543
Come on, Kasparov...

67
00:12:18,584 --> 00:12:19,573
Sit down.

68
00:12:28,361 --> 00:12:30,261
Kasparov played like a bull!

69
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:33,321
Karpov was the wily one!

70
00:12:40,506 --> 00:12:41,495
Come on.

71
00:12:42,075 --> 00:12:44,236
Take out your chess board!

72
00:13:08,801 --> 00:13:10,132
What kept you so long?

73
00:13:10,803 --> 00:13:12,668
The ladies have already
started arriving.

74
00:13:13,606 --> 00:13:15,631
Clean up,
at least look a little presentable.

75
00:13:47,673 --> 00:13:49,334
We're having a kitty party.

76
00:13:49,809 --> 00:13:51,140
All the ladies are here.

77
00:13:51,577 --> 00:13:55,308
Yes! Yes! Sarika is here too!

78
00:13:56,082 --> 00:13:57,982
Sarika, my husband says hello.

79
00:13:58,751 --> 00:14:00,514
Hello.

80
00:14:04,457 --> 00:14:05,515
So, Mukesh!

81
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,949
Working very hard.

82
00:14:09,795 --> 00:14:11,558
Come over to help me sometimes too.

83
00:14:24,844 --> 00:14:26,641
So... when can l expect you?

84
00:14:27,413 --> 00:14:29,347
Mr. Khanna is of hardly
any use in the house!

85
00:14:32,552 --> 00:14:35,214
She just likes to embarrass you!
Don't go pink in the face.

86
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:57,707
Sarika wants to send
over a case of apples!

87
00:14:58,477 --> 00:14:59,808
Go and pick it up soon.

88
00:14:59,946 --> 00:15:01,811
l'll go next Sunday.

89
00:15:02,715 --> 00:15:05,377
Make us all a pot of
good steaming tea, son.

90
00:15:27,506 --> 00:15:29,474
Sarika called again
about the case if apples.

91
00:15:31,877 --> 00:15:34,710
Tomorrow is a holiday
go pick it up.

92
00:15:36,616 --> 00:15:39,244
Listen, her husband
is your uncle's superior.

93
00:15:40,686 --> 00:15:42,210
When such a people call you

94
00:15:42,321 --> 00:15:45,415
even to pick up their rubbish
you thank them for the chance.

95
00:15:47,059 --> 00:15:49,118
And here she wants to
send over a case of apples!

96
00:15:52,431 --> 00:15:53,921
Don't delay it... go tomorrow.

97
00:15:55,067 --> 00:15:56,932
Let me know if you
need anymore bread.

98
00:16:03,142 --> 00:16:06,043
Amit! Get up, son.

99
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:08,078
lt's noon already.

100
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:15,113
You still here?

101
00:16:15,354 --> 00:16:16,981
Just leaving...

102
00:17:01,367 --> 00:17:03,267
ls Sarika ma'am at home?

103
00:17:03,436 --> 00:17:05,495
Who has called you?
There is no Sarika here.

104
00:17:06,505 --> 00:17:07,563
What do you want?

105
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,831
l am Mrs. Verma's nephew.

106
00:17:09,942 --> 00:17:11,603
l have come for the case of apples.

107
00:17:11,977 --> 00:17:13,205
Listen to me carefully.

108
00:17:14,647 --> 00:17:19,141
She is a witch! A proper witch!

109
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:22,447
A snake in a woman's body!

110
00:17:23,422 --> 00:17:25,481
There are no apples here.
l have thrown them all away!

111
00:17:26,058 --> 00:17:27,047
Now run away!

112
00:17:28,094 --> 00:17:29,823
There is no one home... run away!

113
00:17:30,096 --> 00:17:31,825
Beware of her!

114
00:17:31,964 --> 00:17:34,990
Now you show me respect
but later you will also abuse me!

115
00:17:35,101 --> 00:17:36,762
Beware! She will tie you up!

116
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,265
Go! Run away!

117
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:45,699
Biji!

118
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:54,016
l have told you not to
open the door to strangers!

119
00:17:56,622 --> 00:17:59,318
One day someone will slash
our throats and rob everything.

120
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:06,264
Shut the door behind you.

121
00:19:05,357 --> 00:19:06,346
Dolls?

122
00:19:07,426 --> 00:19:11,522
They are mine, my father
was in the foreign services.

123
00:19:13,032 --> 00:19:15,694
l have travelled to many countries
with him when l was a child.

124
00:19:18,237 --> 00:19:19,226
Sit.

125
00:19:45,998 --> 00:19:47,590
Did Pammi not tell you my name?

126
00:19:55,074 --> 00:19:56,063
Sarika.

127
00:20:02,548 --> 00:20:07,611
Why are you always
doing od jobs in the house?

128
00:20:09,455 --> 00:20:11,082
Don't you have friends?

129
00:20:26,205 --> 00:20:27,331
What's the matter?

130
00:20:31,043 --> 00:20:32,567
Do l make you nervous?

131
00:20:39,084 --> 00:20:40,517
You are not a little boy anymore.

132
00:20:46,358 --> 00:20:50,852
Someone might think
that l am misbehaving.

133
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:55,689
Who?

134
00:21:01,407 --> 00:21:03,307
Biji.

135
00:21:05,377 --> 00:21:08,938
She is sleeping...she
can sleep through a bomb blast!

136
00:21:11,717 --> 00:21:15,346
l have come for the case of apples.

137
00:21:18,657 --> 00:21:23,356
You took your time coming
there was a last one left.

138
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:27,130
My husband gave
it away this morning.

139
00:21:29,835 --> 00:21:34,636
More will come soon from
my brother's orchard in Shimla.

140
00:21:52,558 --> 00:21:56,153
Your hair is thick like a girl's!

141
00:21:58,864 --> 00:22:01,662
Comb it properly or get it cut!

142
00:22:55,654 --> 00:22:56,643
Lie down.

143
00:23:33,325 --> 00:23:36,351
Hmm... you're not as afraid
as you were pretending to be!

144
00:24:30,849 --> 00:24:34,751
Are you in a hurry? Do you
have an appointment elsewhere?

145
00:24:46,532 --> 00:24:49,262
Hello.. - Pammi... Sarika here.

146
00:24:50,402 --> 00:24:52,233
l am sending Mukesh to the
market to run an errand for me.

147
00:24:52,571 --> 00:24:53,560
Hope you don't mind?

148
00:24:54,072 --> 00:24:55,733
No...no...not at all!

149
00:24:56,241 --> 00:25:01,178
He hardly does anything
after returning from college.

150
00:25:02,548 --> 00:25:05,449
l've taught him everything so that
he does not sit around in the house.

151
00:25:05,517 --> 00:25:06,882
ldling his time away.

152
00:25:07,352 --> 00:25:09,547
But do make sure he
gives you proper accounting!

153
00:25:12,591 --> 00:25:14,582
Thank you, Pammi. l'll talk later.

154
00:25:20,299 --> 00:25:25,896
Your aunt has taught you shopping
and l'll teach you the rest!

155
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:28,588
Take a bath.

156
00:26:28,667 --> 00:26:30,157
l already did... in the morning!

157
00:26:32,638 --> 00:26:34,230
Then take a bath again.

158
00:26:58,964 --> 00:27:00,158
Bite me.

159
00:27:01,066 --> 00:27:02,761
l want you to leave marks!

160
00:27:14,913 --> 00:27:16,642
You are too much in a hurry kid!

161
00:27:17,649 --> 00:27:18,843
There goes your queen!

162
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:43,368
You are making progress.

163
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:46,839
But there is still
a long way to go.

164
00:27:49,147 --> 00:27:50,136
Check!

165
00:28:41,266 --> 00:28:42,255
Choke me!

166
00:29:19,438 --> 00:29:23,431
Get a haircut and
buy some decent clothes.

167
00:29:26,078 --> 00:29:29,605
You bloody virgin!
You have become quite a whore!

168
00:30:22,868 --> 00:30:25,803
Delhi air is something!
Did you look at his hair style?

169
00:30:30,842 --> 00:30:32,673
Your grandfather is yet
to send money this month.

170
00:30:32,744 --> 00:30:33,836
From where have you got
the new shoes and clothes?

171
00:30:33,912 --> 00:30:35,607
l managed to get
a couple of tuitions.

172
00:30:35,847 --> 00:30:36,939
He is lying.

173
00:30:38,283 --> 00:30:42,344
There has been no inquiry
for an under graduate tutor!

174
00:30:45,257 --> 00:30:49,455
l got it through
the college librarian.

175
00:30:49,861 --> 00:30:51,590
Stays nearby, few blocks from here.

176
00:30:53,098 --> 00:30:54,725
Where are you off to on a holiday?

177
00:30:56,401 --> 00:30:57,629
l have tuition to give.

178
00:31:03,875 --> 00:31:05,035
Ashok is at home.

179
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:07,910
Keep your ears & eyes
open and your mouth shut.

180
00:31:12,184 --> 00:31:17,121
She puts chains on my feet!
But l am not a fool! You hear?

181
00:31:18,256 --> 00:31:21,282
Biji! Apply the brakes
or it is off to bed for you!

182
00:31:24,496 --> 00:31:27,863
He is always hanging around
the house in your absence!

183
00:31:59,798 --> 00:32:01,425
He got late going
to the club today...

184
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,633
l'll have to buy
you a cell phone now.

185
00:32:04,502 --> 00:32:05,992
Don't forget to get the bill.

186
00:32:07,739 --> 00:32:08,831
who is he?

187
00:32:09,441 --> 00:32:11,773
Mrs. Verma's nephew,
very helpful boy.

188
00:32:14,346 --> 00:32:16,678
'That evening l could not
make it back to Sarika's house.'

189
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:20,279
'l was on my way to my home town,
Tohana.'

190
00:32:52,684 --> 00:32:55,517
Sonu and Chhoti
are our responsibility

191
00:32:56,921 --> 00:32:58,912
but we are barely making ends meet.

192
00:33:00,792 --> 00:33:06,594
Mukesh, finish your college quickly.
Everyone's counting on you.

193
00:33:09,601 --> 00:33:11,933
We should sent Chhoti
and Sonu to a girl's home.

194
00:33:16,041 --> 00:33:18,339
Pammi is over burdened as it is.

195
00:33:22,347 --> 00:33:24,781
Sonu...Chhoti...hurry up.

196
00:33:42,967 --> 00:33:44,229
Come on its getting late.

197
00:33:44,302 --> 00:33:46,930
Don't worry,
your brother will visit you often.

198
00:34:16,067 --> 00:34:17,659
'Sarika knew what
was going on in my life.'

199
00:34:18,236 --> 00:34:20,101
'But at first she
chose to remain quiet.'

200
00:34:20,972 --> 00:34:21,961
'Then one day out of the blue..'

201
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,707
Now you will be needing money!

202
00:34:24,442 --> 00:34:25,739
Help this lady out.

203
00:34:27,145 --> 00:34:29,579
She will pay for small
but important errands.

204
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:34,143
lf you are reliable
there would be more jobs.

205
00:34:42,861 --> 00:34:44,385
l am Mukesh.

206
00:34:45,263 --> 00:34:46,252
Stop here.

207
00:34:57,542 --> 00:34:59,601
Hello! l'm Mukesh.

208
00:35:00,044 --> 00:35:01,306
l spoke to you over
the phone yesterday.

209
00:35:01,446 --> 00:35:03,277
Yes...yes... come in.

210
00:35:17,095 --> 00:35:19,188
l can't do this.

211
00:35:22,467 --> 00:35:23,456
Why not?

212
00:35:26,571 --> 00:35:28,471
You seem to be doing
pretty alright here!

213
00:35:29,407 --> 00:35:31,136
l wasn't doing it for the money!

214
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:36,769
What happened?

215
00:35:37,649 --> 00:35:41,642
First she gave me money,
it seemed excessive.

216
00:35:42,921 --> 00:35:44,183
Then...

217
00:35:45,457 --> 00:35:47,288
When l refused she
said she would scream!

218
00:35:47,926 --> 00:35:51,919
She never said anything of that
sort to me seemed pretty happy.

219
00:35:52,897 --> 00:35:55,593
She threatened me that
she would call in the neighbors..

220
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,663
..and say that l had
broken into the house!

221
00:36:01,539 --> 00:36:02,904
l can't do this...

222
00:36:03,908 --> 00:36:05,637
l am not that kind of a boy!

223
00:36:06,778 --> 00:36:07,767
Really!

224
00:36:10,915 --> 00:36:12,348
What kind of a boy are you?

225
00:36:13,084 --> 00:36:15,951
To sleep with women for money!

226
00:36:21,459 --> 00:36:24,326
You take the money!
l don't want any of it!

227
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,608
l've taken my share,
the rest is yours.

228
00:36:49,053 --> 00:36:50,384
l won't do it.

229
00:36:51,155 --> 00:36:55,717
What else do you think you are qualified
for in the first year of college?

230
00:36:58,263 --> 00:37:05,226
Fine! Leave then Don't
come around here anymore!

231
00:37:06,337 --> 00:37:07,326
Get lost!

232
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:14,842
l give you a chance and
you come back crying like a kid.

233
00:37:16,314 --> 00:37:17,804
Don't show me your face again!

234
00:37:38,503 --> 00:37:39,492
Mukesh.

235
00:38:00,124 --> 00:38:04,561
Do you really want to go on living
like a servant in your aunt's house?

236
00:38:07,966 --> 00:38:09,399
Come.

237
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:14,095
Think of all that you
can do with the money.

238
00:38:16,941 --> 00:38:18,909
You can call your
sisters to live with you!

239
00:38:27,852 --> 00:38:29,786
Don't think how the
money comes be happy to know

240
00:38:32,957 --> 00:38:35,289
that there will be more coming.

241
00:38:39,497 --> 00:38:41,795
lf nothing else think
of it as social service!

242
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:47,728
Just do it...

243
00:38:51,876 --> 00:38:54,640
As it is one has to do
a lot for other's happiness.

244
00:38:56,914 --> 00:38:58,381
Think about yourself for once.

245
00:39:00,051 --> 00:39:01,416
Don't you like me?

246
00:39:01,953 --> 00:39:05,889
l like everything! You as well!

247
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:14,496
l also like the benefits
of a marriage in Delhi's society.

248
00:39:25,276 --> 00:39:26,800
l have taught you well!

249
00:39:28,579 --> 00:39:32,709
Now the world will
enjoy your talents.

250
00:39:42,994 --> 00:39:45,360
'The phone numbers were real,
the names were not.'

251
00:39:46,164 --> 00:39:48,359
'l had to ask for the fake name.'

252
00:39:49,033 --> 00:39:50,500
Hello, Neha ma'am.

253
00:39:51,002 --> 00:39:52,663
'lf there was any hesitation
on the other end..'

254
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:54,961
'..l pretended to have
gotten the wrong number.'

255
00:40:13,191 --> 00:40:15,386
You understand what client
servicing means, don't you?

256
00:40:16,694 --> 00:40:18,787
Keep them happy and
they will call you again.

257
00:40:19,764 --> 00:40:21,254
Do whatever they ask of you.

258
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,194
Complaints will not be tolerated.

259
00:40:24,602 --> 00:40:27,127
(Soap opera on TV)

260
00:40:32,744 --> 00:40:34,371
Didn't this fellow Rakesh
die in last week's episode?

261
00:40:34,445 --> 00:40:36,310
Don't you have a TV in your house?

262
00:40:37,148 --> 00:40:38,672
l hardly get the time,
catch up on it.

263
00:40:38,783 --> 00:40:40,808
When l am with you.

264
00:40:43,421 --> 00:40:47,619
Ok, l will tell you
the story after that.

265
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:54,230
A speeding Rakesh
loses control of his car.

266
00:40:56,334 --> 00:40:58,325
Which then falls into a river...

267
00:41:00,371 --> 00:41:04,239
Dheeraj, you scum! You low life!

268
00:41:05,476 --> 00:41:08,843
But he is saved by
the second heroine Ganga!

269
00:41:10,114 --> 00:41:12,082
You were dying to have an affair,
were you not?

270
00:41:14,385 --> 00:41:15,374
Get lost!

271
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:20,619
So Ganga saves Rakesh's life.

272
00:41:21,659 --> 00:41:23,559
But dies herself. A distraught
Rakesh returns to the city!

273
00:41:24,395 --> 00:41:25,521
to the first heroine Priya.

274
00:41:25,863 --> 00:41:28,832
Who is Dheeraj? lf l may ask.

275
00:41:29,967 --> 00:41:32,492
The asshole in my lord
and master... my husband.

276
00:41:34,672 --> 00:41:36,264
Rakesh is dead again !

277
00:41:37,275 --> 00:41:39,038
Yes, this time he's really dead.

278
00:41:42,647 --> 00:41:47,778
Forget about that episode.
Let's finish this episode first.

279
00:44:51,102 --> 00:44:54,503
Hello! Chhoti,
did you get the money l sent you?

280
00:44:55,139 --> 00:44:58,438
Yes, but the warden was
asking too many questions.

281
00:44:59,310 --> 00:45:00,402
Give the phone to Sonu.

282
00:45:01,278 --> 00:45:02,973
Always wants to speak with you.

283
00:45:05,149 --> 00:45:06,673
What was the warden saying?

284
00:45:06,884 --> 00:45:09,318
Same old stuff, who sent the money?

285
00:45:11,922 --> 00:45:13,947
How do l know that
he is really your brother?

286
00:45:14,725 --> 00:45:17,023
lf he is so loaded then why
has he dumped both of you here?

287
00:45:17,194 --> 00:45:19,059
Don't worry, l will come
there and have a word with her.

288
00:45:19,663 --> 00:45:21,062
Chhoti, you go from here.

289
00:45:26,804 --> 00:45:30,240
There is something
not right with this place.

290
00:45:30,708 --> 00:45:32,608
The girls here...

291
00:45:33,077 --> 00:45:34,442
Are they troubling you?

292
00:45:34,512 --> 00:45:37,345
They go out at night in fancy cars,
all dolled up.

293
00:45:38,282 --> 00:45:42,013
Return in the morning,
drunk and loaded with money.

294
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:46,647
The warden gets a cut too!

295
00:45:47,525 --> 00:45:49,686
Yesterday they were forcing
me to go out with them...

296
00:45:49,994 --> 00:45:54,556
Don't worry, l will come
soon and speak to the warden.

297
00:45:57,635 --> 00:45:59,432
Take care of yourself..

298
00:46:01,439 --> 00:46:02,428
bye.

299
00:46:18,689 --> 00:46:20,122
Don't schedule anything
for the weekend.

300
00:46:20,291 --> 00:46:21,280
Why?

301
00:46:21,625 --> 00:46:24,822
l am going to meet my sisters.
l will go every weekend from now on.

302
00:46:25,930 --> 00:46:27,261
What do you think this is,
a government job

303
00:46:27,331 --> 00:46:28,628
that you will get the weekend off?

304
00:46:29,166 --> 00:46:31,634
Go this time...
But don't make it a habit!

305
00:46:35,005 --> 00:46:36,870
Which way to the warden office?

306
00:46:47,184 --> 00:46:49,243
Why don't you take then with you?

307
00:46:52,690 --> 00:46:53,782
l will soon.

308
00:46:58,629 --> 00:47:01,723
Till then, l want them
to be looked after well.

309
00:47:04,001 --> 00:47:07,835
They are still very young
and l have heard that...

310
00:47:08,372 --> 00:47:09,862
What have you heard?

311
00:47:13,577 --> 00:47:15,568
Don't think there is
nobody looking out for them.

312
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:22,548
l have brought a phone for them.

313
00:47:22,686 --> 00:47:25,211
No need for a personal phone.

314
00:47:26,557 --> 00:47:31,893
There is a public phone here.
You talk to them often, don't you?

315
00:47:37,768 --> 00:47:40,999
Buy some gifts for your children.

316
00:47:53,317 --> 00:47:56,013
Keep this and call me everyday.

317
00:47:56,387 --> 00:47:59,584
l will make sure
there is enough credit.

318
00:48:00,624 --> 00:48:02,683
We don't want to stay here!

319
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:06,655
Just a few more days
then l will come and get you.

320
00:48:08,465 --> 00:48:09,454
Promise.

321
00:48:12,803 --> 00:48:14,293
O Mauritius.

322
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:18,035
You are not going to become any fairer
by spending hours under the tap!

323
00:48:18,275 --> 00:48:19,242
Fat fuck!

324
00:48:19,310 --> 00:48:21,835
Has bath once a year and finishes
the whole colony's water supply.

325
00:48:22,413 --> 00:48:23,937
Why would l have a bath everyday,
pretty boy?

326
00:48:24,181 --> 00:48:26,274
l don't run a side
business like you.

327
00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:28,880
Then maybe you should
start running one!

328
00:48:29,086 --> 00:48:32,453
Or else you will keep dreaming
about going to Mauritius

329
00:48:32,556 --> 00:48:34,456
and never actually get there!

330
00:48:34,658 --> 00:48:35,852
Stop whining!

331
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:39,461
There is water left for
you to wash your ass clean!

332
00:48:41,131 --> 00:48:42,223
Johnny bhai.

333
00:48:42,299 --> 00:48:46,429
Hey, tuition master!
Come meet the headmaster.

334
00:48:47,571 --> 00:48:49,436
He is studying to be
a doctor of philosophy.

335
00:48:49,773 --> 00:48:50,762
Ph.D?

336
00:48:51,375 --> 00:48:53,809
Yeah, in chemistry during the day
and in biology during the night!

337
00:48:54,078 --> 00:48:58,071
Better than you, you slob. Making a
living out of scavenging the dead!

338
00:48:59,116 --> 00:49:02,608
That's where you are going to end
up yourself sooner than you think!

339
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:06,387
lt doesn't take much
for the times to change, son.

340
00:49:06,790 --> 00:49:08,724
Fuck off!
Your entire existence is ill timed.

341
00:49:11,729 --> 00:49:12,821
Johnny bhai.

342
00:49:16,267 --> 00:49:17,757
l have a small gift for you.

343
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:24,672
Forever indebted to you, my friend!

344
00:50:40,417 --> 00:50:43,386
ln the beginning l waited
for my husband to get better...

345
00:50:46,790 --> 00:50:52,751
Knew that it might never happen,
but l had hope...

346
00:50:58,802 --> 00:51:01,362
Then eventually,
l started waiting for him to die...

347
00:51:03,974 --> 00:51:09,037
Years went by...
l just kept on waiting...

348
00:51:11,181 --> 00:51:15,174
Sometimes hoping that
my husband would get better.

349
00:51:17,087 --> 00:51:22,582
Sometimes wishing that he would die
so that his suffering would end.

350
00:51:29,433 --> 00:51:31,492
You have no one close?
No immediate family?

351
00:51:32,302 --> 00:51:35,430
l have a son,
a little elder to you...

352
00:51:37,541 --> 00:51:42,205
Lives in Singapore...
sends money too.

353
00:51:43,847 --> 00:51:48,011
But can't come himself
He's got ajob, it's difficult.

354
00:53:06,063 --> 00:53:10,397
You go now, the relatives
will be arriving any time now.

355
00:53:39,696 --> 00:53:42,426
Not much action seems
have happened here last night!

356
00:53:50,107 --> 00:53:51,369
Her husband passed away...

357
00:53:59,249 --> 00:54:02,047
l was trying to call,
Why didn't you answer?

358
00:54:02,352 --> 00:54:04,912
l was in the hospital,
Has switched the ringer off.

359
00:54:10,761 --> 00:54:15,824
Come on, then! We have
paid the rent, why waste it!

360
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:20,961
What's the matter?

361
00:54:22,239 --> 00:54:23,900
l have just left
his body at her house!

362
00:54:42,459 --> 00:54:45,394
Come l'll drop you home.

363
00:54:50,033 --> 00:54:51,796
Don't come home for a few days.

364
00:54:58,275 --> 00:55:00,310
Ashok seems to be in a strange
mood he has no fixed routine.

365
00:55:00,310 --> 00:55:01,743
Comes and goes as he pleases.

366
00:55:06,617 --> 00:55:08,209
Are you angry with me?

367
00:55:13,690 --> 00:55:16,523
You are not my husband that l need to
throw a tantrum to get your attention?

368
00:55:18,462 --> 00:55:19,793
Just do as l tell you.

369
00:55:21,898 --> 00:55:23,866
l'll let you know when
is a good time to come.

370
00:55:29,039 --> 00:55:32,008
Just drop me off here,
l have some work.

371
00:55:47,658 --> 00:55:49,319
That's my friend Johnny.

372
00:55:52,029 --> 00:55:53,087
l'll leave now.

373
00:55:53,864 --> 00:55:55,195
Why did you make me meet him?

374
00:55:56,066 --> 00:55:59,866
He is a friend! Lives nearby. l play
chess with him in the cemetery.

375
00:55:59,936 --> 00:56:01,631
Have you blabbered anything
to him about our work?

376
00:56:01,972 --> 00:56:06,306
No! l just told him that
you help me get tuitions.

377
00:56:07,711 --> 00:56:10,680
Good! Your minds has also
sharpened up along with your body.

378
00:56:24,161 --> 00:56:27,062
So partner,
why did you want to see me?

379
00:56:27,998 --> 00:56:28,930
l need a house.

380
00:56:28,999 --> 00:56:30,091
Are you looking to buy one?

381
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:32,427
No, want to rent one.

382
00:56:34,304 --> 00:56:38,035
So what is the problem?- Nobody
wants to give it to a bachelor.

383
00:56:38,975 --> 00:56:41,910
And l can't call my sister
here until l have a house.

384
00:56:42,412 --> 00:56:44,505
Don't worry! Call your sisters!

385
00:56:45,449 --> 00:56:47,144
How can l call them
till l have a house!

386
00:56:48,185 --> 00:56:49,880
Don't worry about that!

387
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:53,287
l have a lady friend too!

388
00:56:57,928 --> 00:56:59,919
What family were you talking about?
He is a bachelor!

389
00:57:00,130 --> 00:57:04,260
Why? l am there!

390
00:57:04,901 --> 00:57:06,869
These days even two
men can start a family!

391
00:57:06,970 --> 00:57:08,460
Stay within your limits, Johnny!

392
00:57:09,506 --> 00:57:11,474
Just kidding!
He has got two lovely sisters.

393
00:57:12,109 --> 00:57:15,670
They will come and stay with him.
You can lord over them!

394
00:57:16,413 --> 00:57:17,937
They will help you
in your housework too!

395
00:57:18,381 --> 00:57:20,246
How much is the rent?

396
00:57:20,884 --> 00:57:23,819
3,000 rupees, no security because
Johnny has brought you here.

397
00:57:24,054 --> 00:57:25,919
But l will take
three months advance.

398
00:57:26,556 --> 00:57:28,046
My tenants will vacate
the room in 15 days.

399
00:57:28,258 --> 00:57:29,885
But you need to
pay the advance now.

400
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:32,023
His sisters will
be here in 15 days.

401
00:57:32,996 --> 00:57:35,590
He will give you the advance then and
you hand us the keys at the same time.

402
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:37,523
Fair and square, is it not?

403
00:57:39,369 --> 00:57:42,998
Look Johnny, my room shouldn't
go vacant even for a day.

404
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:48,036
Your house is like my own!
l wouldn't be able to bear it.

405
00:57:48,612 --> 00:57:51,080
lf you were to incur
any loss on my account!

406
00:57:51,414 --> 00:57:52,904
May l take one?

407
00:57:53,183 --> 00:57:54,172
Get lost!

408
00:57:56,586 --> 00:57:57,985
Are you a moron?

409
00:57:58,989 --> 00:58:00,980
Rushing to pay the advance when
the house isn't even vacant yet!

410
00:58:01,258 --> 00:58:02,953
You haven't understood
this city at all.

411
00:58:05,128 --> 00:58:08,723
Johnny bhai, thank you.

412
00:58:19,876 --> 00:58:21,639
Oye! What do you
think you are doing?

413
00:58:24,147 --> 00:58:26,741
Hey! l am talking to you!

414
00:58:29,052 --> 00:58:30,212
That is my drawer.

415
00:58:30,287 --> 00:58:33,848
lt was my drawer till
you stuffed your things in.

416
00:58:35,325 --> 00:58:38,158
Your mother has given me the key.

417
00:58:38,395 --> 00:58:40,158
lf my mother gave you
the house keys someday..

418
00:58:40,297 --> 00:58:41,696
..would the house be yours too?

419
00:58:42,632 --> 00:58:46,124
l pay my share of
the rent every month.

420
00:58:46,403 --> 00:58:48,428
You eat worth much
more in a single day!

421
00:58:51,842 --> 00:58:56,677
l will leave your house...
and your drawer as well!

422
00:59:00,951 --> 00:59:02,043
Quit talking about it.

423
00:59:02,385 --> 00:59:04,216
Why don't you actually
do it for a change.

424
00:59:28,245 --> 00:59:32,272
l told you not to come here!
What was so important?

425
00:59:37,888 --> 00:59:39,617
You should not trust me so much!

426
00:59:41,791 --> 00:59:43,190
Where else can l keep it?

427
00:59:43,860 --> 00:59:45,725
All the banks are asking
for an income proof.

428
00:59:46,796 --> 00:59:48,730
l will come and take
it in a couple of weeks.

429
00:59:51,401 --> 00:59:53,426
This bank will charge interest.

430
01:00:21,431 --> 01:00:22,523
Biji has woken up.

431
01:00:33,109 --> 01:00:37,307
lf you can't knock like a civilized
person have the courtesy to look away.

432
01:00:41,451 --> 01:00:42,440
Slut!

433
01:00:45,355 --> 01:00:48,324
Where the fuck do
you think you are going!

434
01:00:53,763 --> 01:00:55,663
Sit here!

435
01:00:58,868 --> 01:01:02,770
l thought my old
mother had gone senile!

436
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:10,375
Then one day l asked myself
how long since Sarika nagged you?

437
01:01:11,247 --> 01:01:14,546
She seems content!
What has changed?

438
01:01:15,485 --> 01:01:17,817
l has my eye on you
but you sensed it some how!

439
01:01:18,088 --> 01:01:20,989
Clever slut that you are... But
you couldn't resist for long eh!

440
01:01:24,661 --> 01:01:27,858
Today l am going to knock
you back to your senses!

441
01:01:32,435 --> 01:01:33,424
Oye!

442
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:38,705
Sit! Mother fucker.

443
01:01:39,109 --> 01:01:40,667
Watch and learn!

444
01:01:45,849 --> 01:01:47,510
Usually you are of no use

445
01:01:49,285 --> 01:01:52,311
does seeing me with him
turn you on? You pervert!

446
01:02:05,468 --> 01:02:09,837
lf you think you are going
to fuck around behind my back..

447
01:02:09,906 --> 01:02:12,773
..and make me look like a fool...
then think again.

448
01:02:46,643 --> 01:02:52,377
'l was scared to go
back to my aunt's house.'

449
01:02:56,319 --> 01:03:00,312
'l needn't have been for Sarika's
husband had already dug my grave.'

450
01:03:13,870 --> 01:03:18,307
Mukesh had come home in the
afternoon to ask Sarika for a loan.

451
01:03:20,477 --> 01:03:24,106
Said that he was not
being treated well by you.

452
01:03:24,614 --> 01:03:27,174
That you do not give him
proper food nor any pocket money.

453
01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:32,210
lnspite of our constraints
we try to do our best for him...

454
01:03:33,289 --> 01:03:41,253
He had been working well up till
now so Sarika felt sorry for him.

455
01:03:42,565 --> 01:03:45,329
At his age boys tend
to mistake sympathy from women

456
01:03:45,535 --> 01:03:47,002
for an interest of another kind.

457
01:03:47,203 --> 01:03:50,297
Yes, boys at this age
can indeed be very foolish.

458
01:03:50,406 --> 01:03:55,207
He tried to grab her
in front of my old mother.

459
01:04:00,850 --> 01:04:02,875
He was smelling of cheap liquor.

460
01:04:04,854 --> 01:04:09,985
So, Sarika pushed him away.
After that he just went mad.

461
01:04:12,028 --> 01:04:16,658
Tried to kiss her..

462
01:04:19,169 --> 01:04:21,637
Caught her arm so hard
that he has left marks!

463
01:04:23,540 --> 01:04:25,838
Sir, let him return home
my husband will take him to a task.

464
01:04:25,942 --> 01:04:29,469
Do not let him return
is what l came to say.

465
01:04:31,714 --> 01:04:33,944
Your husband is due for a promotion
it will be very unfortunate..

466
01:04:34,851 --> 01:04:36,648
..if instead of a promotion he has

467
01:04:36,719 --> 01:04:39,119
to sit in front of some
anti-corruption inquiry committee.

468
01:04:44,194 --> 01:04:45,183
Mukesh...

469
01:04:47,330 --> 01:04:49,798
pack your things right
away and leave the house!

470
01:04:50,967 --> 01:04:52,264
Where will l go, Buaji?

471
01:04:52,468 --> 01:04:53,457
l don't care.

472
01:04:54,504 --> 01:04:58,998
Go to a friend! Or rent a room!

473
01:05:00,376 --> 01:05:02,537
Very independent you have become.

474
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:08,583
You make enough money giving
tuitions to get drunk on.

475
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:16,816
Mr. Khanna is lying! l had
just gone over to meet Sarika.

476
01:05:16,893 --> 01:05:19,487
Everybody is aware
of Sarika's reputation.

477
01:05:21,531 --> 01:05:23,624
Why her husband is targeting you,
l don't know.

478
01:05:24,267 --> 01:05:28,328
But if you stay here, you
will land all of us in trouble...

479
01:05:28,838 --> 01:05:30,567
So for God's sake please spare us.

480
01:07:04,167 --> 01:07:05,156
Oye!

481
01:07:08,871 --> 01:07:09,997
Tuition master!

482
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:11,829
What happened?

483
01:07:15,645 --> 01:07:17,169
And what's with all this luggage?

484
01:07:18,881 --> 01:07:19,870
Come with me...

485
01:07:21,317 --> 01:07:22,375
Come in.

486
01:07:34,464 --> 01:07:35,829
Settle down.

487
01:07:44,507 --> 01:07:45,496
Mauritius.

488
01:07:46,376 --> 01:07:49,038
My aunt's son lives there...
Keeps calling me, says..

489
01:07:49,612 --> 01:07:51,341
..a little investment
can take me far there

490
01:07:51,514 --> 01:07:53,573
But l say, l am too old
to settle in a new place.

491
01:07:56,219 --> 01:07:57,243
Johnny bhai.

492
01:07:58,254 --> 01:07:59,687
My money is stuck somewhere.

493
01:08:00,423 --> 01:08:02,323
l will rent the room
as soon as l get it back.

494
01:08:05,895 --> 01:08:09,831
Play chess with me every night.
Stay for free as long as you like!

495
01:08:28,851 --> 01:08:30,284
When are you coming to get us?

496
01:08:30,386 --> 01:08:35,551
l'll be there soon!
Why? Has something happened?

497
01:08:36,259 --> 01:08:38,523
No, but just come and get us fast.

498
01:08:38,728 --> 01:08:41,253
l'll be there don't worry!

499
01:09:00,349 --> 01:09:02,442
Hello, Kavita ma'am...

500
01:09:03,286 --> 01:09:04,548
Mukesh here.

501
01:09:04,687 --> 01:09:06,814
Who Mukesh?
There is no Kavita here...

502
01:09:08,558 --> 01:09:10,150
Don't call back again.

503
01:09:19,235 --> 01:09:20,827
Hello, Reena ma'am.

504
01:09:20,970 --> 01:09:22,267
This is Mukesh here.

505
01:09:23,406 --> 01:09:26,603
You haven't called last few days so
l thought l should call and inquire.

506
01:09:26,676 --> 01:09:27,802
Wrong number.

507
01:09:30,780 --> 01:09:33,146
Mrs. Kajal?
This is Mukesh calling.

508
01:09:34,016 --> 01:09:35,005
Usha ma'am.

509
01:09:35,251 --> 01:09:36,377
This is Mukesh calling.

510
01:09:36,586 --> 01:09:38,486
Mrs. Vandana?
- Wrong number.

511
01:09:38,788 --> 01:09:40,415
Sorry, l won't call back again.

512
01:09:46,329 --> 01:09:48,160
Hello, Sarika ma'am...

513
01:09:48,297 --> 01:09:50,959
l have told you not to call here...
Don't call back again.

514
01:09:54,203 --> 01:09:55,864
This is Mukesh calling.

515
01:09:58,774 --> 01:09:59,763
Sorry.

516
01:10:46,489 --> 01:10:47,979
Who is there ma?

517
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:53,726
Somebody's got the wrong address.

518
01:11:27,129 --> 01:11:28,391
What are you doing here?

519
01:11:29,532 --> 01:11:31,022
Leave! My husband can come anytime!

520
01:11:33,536 --> 01:11:34,525
Did he hit you?

521
01:11:36,172 --> 01:11:37,901
What else do you expect? A trophy?

522
01:11:39,575 --> 01:11:42,442
My sisters are coming,
l need my money.

523
01:11:43,145 --> 01:11:44,169
Are you done?

524
01:11:44,513 --> 01:11:47,346
They rescheduled my
appointment for tomorrow.

525
01:12:22,218 --> 01:12:23,207
Breakfast!

526
01:12:35,231 --> 01:12:38,325
Johnny bhai, l need a favour?

527
01:12:39,101 --> 01:12:40,090
What?

528
01:12:41,270 --> 01:12:45,331
You will have to go to that lady's
house the one that you met with me.

529
01:12:50,579 --> 01:12:52,376
Why don't you go yourself?

530
01:12:53,482 --> 01:12:59,148
My aunt lives in the same
colony if she sees me there...

531
01:13:03,826 --> 01:13:05,384
What work do you have with her?

532
01:13:58,581 --> 01:14:00,776
Sleeping through the
day begets bad luck my friend!

533
01:14:05,387 --> 01:14:10,017
She says that your due
has already been paid to you.

534
01:14:12,194 --> 01:14:14,458
Your lady friend didn't
even let me enter the house!

535
01:14:14,864 --> 01:14:16,331
She started shouting

536
01:14:16,999 --> 01:14:19,297
and threatening me saying
that she will call her husband!

537
01:14:21,437 --> 01:14:24,770
They have given your number to the
cops even filed a report against you...

538
01:14:25,274 --> 01:14:29,108
What the hell are you upto? You
will get me into trouble as well

539
01:14:32,581 --> 01:14:34,048
Screwed up my work.

540
01:14:36,952 --> 01:14:38,681
Got me thrown out of the house.

541
01:14:40,422 --> 01:14:42,049
And now she says
she will not pay me!

542
01:14:44,860 --> 01:14:52,460
Bitch! Does she think
l am scared of her and her husband!

543
01:14:52,535 --> 01:14:54,469
What does she think of herself?

544
01:14:54,537 --> 01:14:56,869
Calm down!
Shut up and listen to me!

545
01:14:59,542 --> 01:15:01,339
What the fuck do
you think you are doing!

546
01:15:02,678 --> 01:15:04,543
Come to your senses!
Have you lost it!

547
01:15:13,389 --> 01:15:16,119
l don't know what kind
of tuitions you have been giving.

548
01:15:22,164 --> 01:15:23,631
But learn this from me.

549
01:15:25,501 --> 01:15:28,299
Take out your sim card!

550
01:15:30,406 --> 01:15:33,239
Stay away from them
they are rich and connected!

551
01:15:33,309 --> 01:15:36,301
They will get you busted
so bad you won't know what hit you!

552
01:15:39,148 --> 01:15:41,116
Give me the sim card
l will throw it away.

553
01:15:42,017 --> 01:15:44,679
lf you throw my sim card
then how will my sisters call me?

554
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:46,314
Give them my number!

555
01:15:46,422 --> 01:15:49,858
And what if someone calls you?
- Have you ever heard my phone ring?

556
01:15:54,029 --> 01:15:56,554
Use my card and
give them this number.

557
01:16:04,173 --> 01:16:06,107
l am not going to let
her get away with this!

558
01:16:06,876 --> 01:16:08,241
l will cut her to pieces!

559
01:16:08,777 --> 01:16:10,074
Don't talk shit.

560
01:16:12,281 --> 01:16:14,340
We are out of booze as well!
Come...

561
01:16:16,685 --> 01:16:17,709
Come on...

562
01:16:18,587 --> 01:16:20,452
This godforsaken town
is a real shit hole!

563
01:16:20,923 --> 01:16:23,824
You place your trust in people
thinking they are your friends.

564
01:16:24,193 --> 01:16:29,460
But the moment you turn around
they ram it right up your ass.

565
01:16:30,032 --> 01:16:32,762
l'll go give this
number to my sisters.

566
01:16:33,269 --> 01:16:36,932
Ok, but now don't go
stressing them out as well.

567
01:16:45,481 --> 01:16:46,311
Hello, Sonu!

568
01:16:46,415 --> 01:16:48,883
Are you alright?

569
01:16:49,551 --> 01:16:50,882
Who's number is this?

570
01:16:51,020 --> 01:16:52,851
lt's a friend's number,
save it on your phone.

571
01:16:54,256 --> 01:16:55,985
What's this noise are you outside?

572
01:16:56,792 --> 01:17:00,785
What are you doing out so late?
- We have run away from there...

573
01:17:01,230 --> 01:17:02,697
We are on our way to Delhi.

574
01:17:03,232 --> 01:17:04,324
Run away!

575
01:17:04,700 --> 01:17:07,760
What do you mean you have run away!
Have you gone mad!

576
01:17:08,237 --> 01:17:09,261
What the hell is going on there?

577
01:17:09,371 --> 01:17:11,271
l'll explain everything
once l reach.

578
01:17:11,373 --> 01:17:12,840
l told you to stay
on for a few days!

579
01:17:13,042 --> 01:17:15,340
Can't you understand that much?
Are you little children!

580
01:17:15,444 --> 01:17:18,106
Brother, please don't
get angry...the warden.

581
01:17:19,081 --> 01:17:20,548
What did she do?

582
01:17:21,984 --> 01:17:25,715
Sonu, tell me what happened?

583
01:17:25,988 --> 01:17:27,979
She got drunk and came in Chhoti's
room...

584
01:17:28,490 --> 01:17:29,787
Was trying to slip into her bed.

585
01:17:30,125 --> 01:17:33,526
l'll explain everything tomorrow.

586
01:17:33,829 --> 01:17:40,860
You both take care of yourselves...
Do you have money?

587
01:17:41,203 --> 01:17:42,101
Yes.

588
01:17:42,204 --> 01:17:44,399
Call me as soon as your reach,
l will come and get you.

589
01:17:50,012 --> 01:17:51,445
Here, gulp it down.

590
01:17:54,083 --> 01:17:55,175
Johnny bhai.

591
01:17:56,919 --> 01:17:59,046
Could you lend me some money?

592
01:17:59,321 --> 01:18:01,152
l will return it soon.

593
01:18:03,225 --> 01:18:04,214
Money?

594
01:18:07,029 --> 01:18:09,827
lf l had any money saved do you think
l would have been stuck in this city.

595
01:18:09,999 --> 01:18:13,127
l would have gone away
to Mauritius long back!

596
01:18:15,237 --> 01:18:19,970
l live off the dead!
l bury one corpse to get one meal!

597
01:18:21,276 --> 01:18:24,268
l am surviving because
people die in this city everyday.

598
01:18:27,149 --> 01:18:29,447
l would have run
away long time back.

599
01:18:30,686 --> 01:18:35,316
To Mauritius...
to white sands... to blue skies...

600
01:18:38,093 --> 01:18:40,857
You are young you
will get many chances.

601
01:18:46,035 --> 01:18:47,024
Brother.

602
01:18:47,836 --> 01:18:49,064
Stop for a minute...

603
01:19:12,694 --> 01:19:15,822
You are with me because
this is your first night.

604
01:19:22,071 --> 01:19:24,062
From tomorrow you are on your own.

605
01:19:27,876 --> 01:19:30,970
Be tough! Don't be scared!

606
01:19:53,469 --> 01:19:54,595
Do we wait here?

607
01:19:56,738 --> 01:19:57,932
l'll go first.

608
01:20:03,612 --> 01:20:05,170
How much money should l ask for?

609
01:20:08,083 --> 01:20:11,211
2,000 rupees don't settle for less.

610
01:20:29,471 --> 01:20:31,735
Drink up!

611
01:20:38,580 --> 01:20:41,515
Go on, have another swig.
lt eases the pain!

612
01:20:45,654 --> 01:20:46,678
Move aside.

613
01:20:49,758 --> 01:20:51,988
Time to get to work!

614
01:20:59,902 --> 01:21:01,028
Looking for fun?
- Yes!

615
01:21:01,703 --> 01:21:04,103
How much will you pay?
- Let's bargain on the way.

616
01:21:30,065 --> 01:21:32,533
There is one!
Standing all by himself!

617
01:21:32,634 --> 01:21:34,659
Back up.

618
01:21:42,678 --> 01:21:50,676
l am tired of whores around here
let's try the pretty boys for size!

619
01:21:52,721 --> 01:21:53,881
Three of you?

620
01:21:54,089 --> 01:21:56,523
Why, you gonna cook for us tonight?

621
01:21:59,494 --> 01:22:01,052
All three of you will have to pay!

622
01:22:03,699 --> 01:22:08,102
Sure, but let us
see the goods first.

623
01:22:09,438 --> 01:22:11,531
Go on, he is calling you!

624
01:22:12,207 --> 01:22:16,268
Why so wound up?
Are you a first timer?

625
01:22:19,615 --> 01:22:20,980
2,000 rupees for each of you!

626
01:22:22,317 --> 01:22:23,909
That's the rate,
take it or leave it!

627
01:22:24,019 --> 01:22:28,149
The little fucker wants
to play posh! Drag him in boys!

628
01:22:29,558 --> 01:22:31,753
Get in you faggot spreading
filth on the streets!

629
01:22:32,094 --> 01:22:33,322
Give the money first.

630
01:22:33,395 --> 01:22:36,296
The motherfucker thinks
he is prime piece of ass!

631
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:39,489
Let go of me!

632
01:22:41,703 --> 01:22:44,263
Don't worry about the three
of us you won't get past even one!

633
01:22:44,640 --> 01:22:46,471
Open the door! Let me out!

634
01:22:46,708 --> 01:22:48,938
Stop the car! Let me go!

635
01:23:54,309 --> 01:23:55,742
What happened?

636
01:23:58,447 --> 01:24:01,177
Come here... Mukesh!

637
01:24:22,738 --> 01:24:23,932
What happened?

638
01:24:31,580 --> 01:24:32,569
Show!

639
01:24:40,021 --> 01:24:42,216
Look, l don't know
what's going on with you

640
01:24:43,392 --> 01:24:45,121
but whatever it is, get out of it.

641
01:24:45,527 --> 01:24:47,825
Forget the past... start afresh.

642
01:24:53,969 --> 01:24:56,233
Johnny, l won't give
up what is rightfully mine.

643
01:26:19,354 --> 01:26:20,343
Have you lost your mind!

644
01:26:25,694 --> 01:26:27,025
What do you want?

645
01:26:27,929 --> 01:26:31,592
l am not here for you...
My work has been stopped.

646
01:26:35,403 --> 01:26:36,392
Your work?

647
01:26:39,875 --> 01:26:41,843
l told your friend about it...
go ask him.

648
01:26:42,777 --> 01:26:44,745
Who stopped it?
- What do you think?

649
01:26:46,781 --> 01:26:47,770
Your husband?

650
01:26:50,285 --> 01:26:50,876
Why?

651
01:26:50,986 --> 01:26:53,352
He did not know about the work
or the boys.

652
01:26:56,691 --> 01:26:57,680
Boys?

653
01:27:00,095 --> 01:27:01,153
There were others.

654
01:27:20,749 --> 01:27:23,013
For the last time,
where is the money?

655
01:27:23,852 --> 01:27:28,346
There is 2,000 in the almirah,
take it and leave!

656
01:27:28,757 --> 01:27:31,021
Next time you come my husband
will be waiting for you!

657
01:27:31,159 --> 01:27:32,558
l haven't come for a handout!

658
01:27:33,261 --> 01:27:34,990
l want money that
is rightfully mine!

659
01:27:35,630 --> 01:27:37,359
So go and ask the
one who has taken it.

660
01:27:37,499 --> 01:27:38,761
Ask whom? Your husband?

661
01:27:39,601 --> 01:27:43,332
He earns more in a day than you
have managed in all these months!

662
01:27:43,705 --> 01:27:45,434
Go and ask your friend!

663
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:47,808
The scoundrel even
looked like a thief.

664
01:27:48,109 --> 01:27:49,098
Don't lie.

665
01:27:51,313 --> 01:27:54,180
Why do you lie?

666
01:27:59,988 --> 01:28:01,956
Did you learn anything
from me in all these months?

667
01:28:02,557 --> 01:28:03,819
Apart from sex!

668
01:28:20,275 --> 01:28:27,681
Our work can start again,
leave now... Think of your sisters.

669
01:28:27,816 --> 01:28:30,546
l am never sinking
back into your filth again!

670
01:28:31,152 --> 01:28:33,586
l want my money and l want it now!

671
01:28:39,661 --> 01:28:41,151
Sarika, open the door.

672
01:28:43,064 --> 01:28:45,532
Did you foresee this while
you were planning your break in?

673
01:28:56,778 --> 01:28:58,040
Sarika! Open the door!

674
01:28:59,414 --> 01:29:01,609
l know there is someone inside!

675
01:29:03,518 --> 01:29:04,780
Open up!

676
01:29:07,622 --> 01:29:09,954
Open up or l will
cal in the neighbors!

677
01:29:16,731 --> 01:29:18,824
Today the whole world
will see your true colors...

678
01:29:18,933 --> 01:29:20,867
l will rub your face in dirt.

679
01:29:21,569 --> 01:29:22,558
Mukesh.

680
01:29:25,140 --> 01:29:26,129
Come here.

681
01:29:27,008 --> 01:29:28,976
l don't care what people
will think of me...

682
01:29:29,110 --> 01:29:31,340
But you will never be
able to face anyone again!

683
01:29:34,616 --> 01:29:36,208
Put the knife in me!

684
01:29:36,418 --> 01:29:37,407
What?

685
01:29:38,853 --> 01:29:40,980
You don't have to kill me!
lnsert it in a little bit!

686
01:29:42,724 --> 01:29:44,692
Sarika! l'll break open the door!

687
01:29:48,563 --> 01:29:50,258
He will kill both of us!

688
01:29:55,303 --> 01:29:59,535
Good! We will die together
like star-crossed lovers!

689
01:30:23,998 --> 01:30:26,159
l am warning you for
the last time Sarika!

690
01:31:07,308 --> 01:31:08,605
That felt good.

691
01:31:35,970 --> 01:31:37,870
First class first!

692
01:31:39,841 --> 01:31:45,404
lt was never Johnny who betrayed
me...lt has always been you.

693
01:31:46,481 --> 01:31:48,449
And today,
you want to get away again.

694
01:31:49,350 --> 01:31:51,341
Not this time!

695
01:33:34,122 --> 01:33:35,453
This is Mukesh.

696
01:33:35,523 --> 01:33:36,649
ls Johnny there?

697
01:33:36,824 --> 01:33:37,916
Who, Karpov?

698
