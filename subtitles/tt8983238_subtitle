1
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,920
'No birds or animals were harmed
during the making of this film'

2
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,400
Chennai which had been housing
millions of people

3
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,720
is now home to billions

4
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,120
People come to the city to study...

5
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,240
to engage in jobs...

6
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,400
IT employees...

7
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,200
Movie aspirants...

8
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,520
Laborers from North India

9
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,800
Ex-farmers

10
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,360
Chennai had opened its
gates for many such people

11
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,880
Times have changed

12
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,120
Chennai, the nurturer of its
refugees is the mantra

13
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:46,120
Survival of the fittest

14
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,200
Wealth, recognition and fame...

15
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,680
Most people trail after one
of these three things or...

16
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,760
they seek all three

17
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,320
No one is bothered about
their fellow beings

18
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,320
From politicians to the thugs...

19
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,920
Everyone's replacement happens in a jiffy

20
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,480
As fast an illegal acquisition

21
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,600
In this city of heavily
mechanized society

22
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,160
I was facing the music
for falling in love

23
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,240
This is me

24
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,520
I'm Jaya

25
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,040
- 'This is my dad, Arumugam'
- Dad

26
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,680
- What?
- Mom is heading to the ration shop

27
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,160
She wants Rs 20

28
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,320
There you go

29
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,840
- Ask your sister to get me the lunch
- Copied, dad

30
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,600
I had 3 siblings

31
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,040
I am last one

32
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,960
Don't hit me
It's hurting

33
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,480
I said 'it's hurting'

34
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,360
Don't fight

35
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,760
What is this uncouthness?

36
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,040
I did no mistake

37
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,200
She randomly started hitting me

38
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,840
- Why did you hit him?
- Back then when I was tying my shoe lace...

39
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,960
He pushed me and made
me fall with the bag

40
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,080
Why did you push her?

41
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,080
That was before the holidays

42
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,400
She is avenging it now

43
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,120
- Before 2 months?
- Yes, dad

44
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,120
Why?

45
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,560
I wanted to hit him then

46
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,880
But left the town

47
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,120
You are back just today

48
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,080
This mongrel is caught now

49
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,080
I pursued my bachelors in
Government arts college

50
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,000
This is where I met
Ibrahim for the first time

51
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:02,320
I'll make your kids
sparkle like the stars

52
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,920
Knock, and the door will be opened

53
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,720
whatsoever you shall
ask, you shall receive

54
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,200
Seek it, you shall find it

55
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,560
I fell in love with him
against my own reflexes

56
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,400
I made him fall in love as well

57
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,240
"Wow! Wow!"

58
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,360
"She approached step by step"

59
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,640
"and made me fall for her"

60
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,880
"She ravished me"

61
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,200
"With her beauty"

62
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,520
"Her sexy eyes besotted me"

63
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,400
"Her sexy eyes besotted me"

64
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,760
"Into a world of trance"

65
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,680
"With her intoxicated eyes..."

66
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:52,600
"She was entrancing with
her intoxicated eyes"

67
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:57,720
"She changed me
a boring man into a romantic Romeo"

68
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,000
"She approached step by step"

69
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,720
"and made me fall for her"

70
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,880
"She ravished me"

71
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,640
"With her beauty"

72
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,560
"Hey Sangeetha!"

73
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,480
"Don’t you know her sweetness?"

74
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,840
"Won’t your shy smiles
Could make one’s day?"

75
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,400
"Hey Sangeetha!"

76
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,320
"Don’t you know her sweetness?"

77
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,600
"Won’t your shy smiles
Could make one’s day?"

78
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,360
"Hey ponytail Oviya!"

79
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,560
"Hey ponytail Oviya!"

80
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,280
"You drove me crazy"

81
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,840
"Won’t you gaze at me?"

82
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,440
"Won't you?"

83
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,120
Please try to understand
We are students

84
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,720
We are protesting peacefully

85
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,920
Someone is running a wine
shop close by the premises

86
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,440
We are fighting for you too

87
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,720
Haven't your family faced issues
because of the liquor shops?

88
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,440
Sir!

89
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,720
What are you doing?

90
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,200
No Jaya...
Listen Jaya, don't...

91
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,560
Please don't hit her

92
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,480
Try to realize
We are students

93
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,720
Don't hit

94
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,920
What's with your hand?

95
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,600
It's the obvious consequence
of hitting a cop

96
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,040
They fractured her wrist

97
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,240
You hit the cop?

98
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,440
None has the rights to hit us

99
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,000
One gets beaten up is a fool

100
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,640
So is the one who hits

101
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,040
I don't like both

102
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,400
If one hits us, it
must be paid back

103
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,640
Hey!

104
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,120
We were dating presuming
that it was a discreet one

105
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,880
We later realised
that we were wrong

106
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,320
My family disliked Ibrahim

107
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,600
I liked none but him

108
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,920
I converted to Islam
and married him

109
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,840
Me, Jaya became Raziya for Ibrahim

110
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,280
Why hasn't been this old house renovated?

111
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,440
Old?

112
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,200
My great grandfather's
grand father

113
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,320
who was working in the cavalry of
Arcot Nawab got this house as a gift

114
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,120
by the very own Arcot Nawab

115
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,200
It's almost 200 years old

116
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,520
We relished the course of our life

117
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,520
Hey darling

118
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,680
One more time, please

119
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,640
That's task for the dusk

120
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,100
Had I known that you are so naughty,
I wouldn't have married you

121
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,160
- What?
- Sorry

122
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,100
I wouldn't have Nikah'ed you

123
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,680
You are blaming me?

124
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,560
You claw marked me
all over the body

125
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,320
and blaming me

126
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,040
Had I possessed the super powers

127
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,480
I would have never
allowed the sun to rise

128
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,120
Hey...

129
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,600
Come on

130
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,040
What's the stream?

131
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,360
What's the nature of the job?

132
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,040
Accountant in Mohammed
Rawther's leather factory

133
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,200
Who is Mohammed
Rawther?

134
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,280
Who hired you?

135
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,040
Boxy

136
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,760
Dare you to hurt the boss

137
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,800
Yaasim

138
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,960
Let's slay Boxy in Bombay itself

139
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,680
Don't shower mercy

140
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,760
Pack him in a drum

141
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,720
and keep it in our locality

142
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,520
- Let others know about his death
- Okay, boss

143
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,120
- Yaasim!
- Brother

144
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,400
Where is Kareem?

145
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,720
Instead of sending hit men
one at a time like a coward

146
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,960
I dare Boxy to enter Madras

147
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,520
Boxy had arranged
a hit man to kill boss

148
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,360
- Is dad safe?
- Yes

149
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,120
- We managed to nab him on time
- Where is Hussain?

150
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:14,960
Is he safe?

151
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,640
I need to be home
My hubby will be arriving soon

152
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,200
A wicket in the next over

153
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,280
Make the bet for Rs 5 lakhs

154
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,280
Hussain...

155
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,840
You are lucky mascot making me win

156
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,400
Uncle...

157
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,200
I was thinking, 'why not seek
a job offer for my wife here?'

158
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,160
Can you request boss?

159
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,000
Let her not work here

160
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,920
I'll let you know

161
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,640
Brother

162
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,080
Give me 2

163
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,960
Yasim...

164
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:16,080
Your wife is works in
a Pycrofts road, right?

165
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,720
Yes she does,
against my wish

166
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,880
Ibrahim's wife is seeking a job

167
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,480
Can you please refer?

168
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,640
Definitely

169
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,600
I'm coming

170
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,400
Please take care of her

171
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,720
I will

172
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,120
It's your maiden trip

173
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,360
Stay alert, okay?

174
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,120
If you are through

175
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,640
You can earn a good money

176
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,440
You can settle down

177
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,880
Complete this task

178
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,480
Don't share it with anyone

179
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,520
Okay, brother

180
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,160
Not even with your wife

181
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,040
Focus on the task
Nothing else

182
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,440
Okay

183
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,400
Hello

184
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,800
It's late night

185
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,080
When are you coming?

186
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,120
Just 15 days

187
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,440
It's like I'm getting a promotion

188
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,920
Boss has insisted that I
have to take up this task

189
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,480
- So...
- It's been just 6 months since marriage

190
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,240
Here you go leaving me alone

191
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,880
It's not my intention

192
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,120
Rather you could
have worked abroad

193
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,080
I insisted that you work here

194
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:01,120
and not abroad is because
I could see you everyday

195
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,920
Everyday visit doesn't make a difference

196
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,560
What do you want?

197
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,640
I will elaborate on our next meet

198
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,680
Keep yearning

199
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,880
Board

200
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,360
Hold on

201
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,920
Pass me the phone

202
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,960
I'll resume on the
call once I reach

203
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,200
Give it to me

204
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,560
Keep this one

205
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,480
I'll give your phone once your return

206
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,040
Don't call anyone from that phone

207
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,520
- See you
- Okay

208
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,640
'The number you are trying to reach...'

209
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,760
'...is not reachable at the moment'

210
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,760
'...is switched off'

211
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,760
I have earn a lot

212
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,080
A huge house

213
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:07,920
Car...

214
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,280
We will enjoy these
with our kids

215
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:19,520
"The chillness spreads through
My spine in this winter's dusk"

216
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:29,040
"Why do you wait
While I am fully ripe?"

217
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:33,840
"Am I fantasizing about
Sharing the love with you?"

218
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,560
"Will you be my eternal partner?"

219
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:42,520
"Pampering you like my baby?"

220
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,880
"Come here to make it true"

221
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,840
"Come closer"

222
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:57,080
"The chillness spreads through
My spine in this winter's dusk"

223
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:07,040
"Why do you wait
While I am fully ripe?"

224
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,040
- Can you get me a tea?
- Get lost

225
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,560
Hey kid...come here

226
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,160
One more tea please

227
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,880
There you go

228
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,560
Have it

229
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:38,200
"I'm longing to get drenched
in the dawn's waves with you"

230
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,160
Don't you have a business to take care of?

231
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,640
You postpone the romantic
chapter for wedding

232
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,240
Post marriage, you
are brushing us away

233
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:53,960
"My desire is longing for you, my beau"

234
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,800
"I'll be waiting for you to see everyday"

235
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:04,880
"I was crying the whole day
to see your face again"

236
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,760
How big is your house?

237
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,560
Can it accommodate one more?

238
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,680
Doctor?

239
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,520
You will have a baby

240
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,280
- Thanks
- Okay

241
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:19,120
"My man's breathe breezes on me"

242
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:24,120
"I am longing for your fragrance"

243
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,720
"You cast your spell on me"

244
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,560
"This wait is bittersweet"

245
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,840
Darling...

246
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,680
2 girls...

247
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,200
and 2 boys

248
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,400
That's enough?

249
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:41,880
I fear that you will make me
give birth to a baby every month

250
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,320
Monthly?

251
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,840
I'm aiming at a baby per week

252
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,840
"I need you..."

253
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,400
Hello!

254
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,000
My dear wife...

255
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,000
What are you doing?

256
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,720
Where have you been?

257
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,040
When will you come?

258
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,560
I'm desperately waiting

259
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,240
I'll be there in a while

260
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,200
Dress up in the pink salwar

261
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,600
Decorate yourself with jasmine

262
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,880
We shall watch a new movie

263
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,920
I have come up with new techniques

264
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,800
We shall give it a try tonight

265
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,960
Shut up

266
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,360
Take rest

267
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,000
You can't rest in the night

268
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:25,080
"The chillness spreads through"

269
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:30,000
"My spine in this winter's dusk"

270
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:38,440
"Why do you wait
While I am fully ripe?"

271
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,560
Ibu!!

272
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,280
Ibu!!

273
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,360
Stay inside

274
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,760
It's a police firing

275
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,640
Let me go!

276
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,640
Come inside

277
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,880
Ibu...!

278
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,120
Let me go

279
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,480
Listen!

280
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,120
Try to understand

281
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,680
Stop

282
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,440
Sir!

283
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,520
Sir...

284
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,840
Did you see my husband?

285
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,560
We came here to encounter a guy

286
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,440
Encounter?

287
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,240
While attempting to fire him...

288
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,520
2 civilians got hurt

289
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,920
They are taken to the government hospital

290
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,560
Government hospital?

291
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,040
Nurse...

292
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,080
Nurse...

293
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,480
- Nurse...
- Excuse me, madam

294
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,600
- We are waiting in the queue
- Excuse me, madam

295
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,120
Has anyone been admitted
here for a bullet wound?

296
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,640
From Triplicane?

297
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,480
3 people have suffered a bullet injury

298
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,720
One is dead

299
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,280
-What's your husband name?
- Ibrahim

300
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,040
Mr Ganesh, please escort her

301
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,960
- You go with him
- Please come

302
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,360
This way

303
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,080
Come fast

304
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,480
The encounter death
named Ibrahim...

305
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,320
She is his wife

306
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,280
Please wait for a while
Doctor will be arriving shortly

307
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,520
What are you doing?
You are not allowed to touch it

308
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:56,040
Don't go inside
I have been telling you

309
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,840
You are not supposed to touch it

310
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,120
Ibu...

311
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,760
Ibu...

312
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,920
Ibu...

313
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,680
Ibu...

314
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,200
Ibu...

315
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,440
Ibu...

316
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,920
I'm conceived, Ibu

317
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,320
Look at me, Ibu

318
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,160
Please come out

319
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,440
- Ibu...
- Sir, please make her understand

320
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,320
She is very stubborn

321
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,320
Let him do his duty

322
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,360
Please go out, they will surrender
the body after the formalities

323
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,480
Drag her away

324
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,400
I said you know

325
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,200
Ibu!

326
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:46,120
Lift her leg too, sir
You hold her hand

327
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,440
Doctor, evening we are going
to funeral her husband

328
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,800
- We will bring her
- No...no...

329
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,080
She has been just got aborted

330
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,080
It will take 24 hours for
her to gain consciousness

331
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,720
She needs to rest at least for a week

332
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:39,880
Ibrahim's final procession
will be held in the evening

333
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,800
Do not cry

334
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,000
Don't get up

335
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,000
Do not cry...

336
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:52,080
Doctor has advised not to strain

337
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,200
Please don't strain yourself

338
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,080
Take care of your health

339
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,080
Her husband was killed in a police firing

340
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,840
It's the fate he had to
meet for drug peddling

341
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,760
Nothing to worry
Forget it

342
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,760
Ibu? You have taken away
our baby along with you

343
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,320
I did tell you

344
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,840
This place will bring his memories

345
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,040
Let her stay in our
house for sometime

346
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,960
Ibrahim was like a son to me

347
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,440
You are always welcome at my home

348
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,760
Abdul!

349
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,120
One million rupees

350
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,800
Keep it for your current expenses

351
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,720
Once you run out of cash...

352
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,000
Call Abdul

353
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,840
I will help you out

354
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,200
Take care

355
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,920
Brother...

356
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,200
Why did they kill him?

357
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,840
What is the nature of your business?

358
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,720
If he is a criminal...

359
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,640
You are his employer...
So what are you then?

360
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,560
Why weren't you killed?

361
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,960
My employees...

362
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,800
love this job

363
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:13,320
No one takes the responsibility
for anyone's life

364
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,720
Don't let your thoughts waver

365
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,240
Act smart

366
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,960
I need to kill the cops
in the same way

367
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,440
as Ibu was killed

368
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,360
We will take care of that

369
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,480
Who are you?

370
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,080
Get in

371
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,360
Sit down

372
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,520
Tell me

373
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,040
Brother...

374
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,320
Everyone is accusing him as a 'criminal'

375
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,640
They are accusing him for drug peddling

376
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,800
I know him

377
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,840
It's not his nature

378
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,800
I'm puzzled

379
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:30,160
Why did they kill such
a good man in an encounter?

380
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,880
You were a father figure to him

381
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,600
Why was he killed?

382
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,960
Go to your room and study

383
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:59,200
I'm going to reveal a very big secret

384
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,360
Ibrahim was killed in an encounter

385
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,000
But the one who planned it...

386
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,960
was Mohammed Rawther

387
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,120
My boss Rawther...

388
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,480
is the one who deals with
every other unethical job

389
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:24,400
Selling cheap goods in
the pretext of imported materials

390
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,200
Their current business
is drug distribution

391
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:32,040
We are accounting for this unethical job

392
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,360
He is the client of...

393
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,160
Ashok Saet who is addressed as 'Lala'

394
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,040
He has contacts with big shots

395
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,760
He is one among the few who
finance the political parties

396
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,160
From politicians...

397
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,280
to labourers...

398
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,800
Everybody gets paycheques from him

399
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,320
Along with the seasonal perks

400
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,760
He operates this business
in a corporate model

401
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,920
Edison is the unappointed
CEO of this business

402
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:03,240
"A girl like butterfly..."

403
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,680
- Edison
- Lala?

404
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,800
Who is this actress?

405
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,600
Lala...

406
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:16,400
Thailand informed that he has
credited to the Panama account

407
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,920
He takes care of the accounting

408
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,600
Rawther is their operational in-charge

409
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,920
Since cops get their bribes...

410
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,480
They seldom care

411
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:31,040
Also the cops arrest
people as per their advice

412
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,000
Then they bail them out

413
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,120
Hey!

414
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,600
Come out
You have been bailed out

415
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,920
If the media buzzes about this...

416
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,680
They pick up a scape-goat...

417
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,720
Mostly it would be one who is tough
to harness or a threat to them

418
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,800
They will remove him from the threat
list with the help of the cops

419
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,000
At this juncture...

420
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,840
One amongst our guys

421
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:56,080
Was on duty of dispatching
the drug to a rich client

422
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,240
How much have you got?

423
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,320
5 grams

424
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,320
5 grams?
It's of no use

425
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,240
- Hey!
- Hey!

426
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,400
Moron!

427
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,280
He has no regards for the money

428
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,720
Excuse me...

429
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,920
Where are you heading
without giving us the stuff?

430
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:22,200
Your man grabbed the whole thing

431
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,840
Give us the stuff that you are
supposed to sell to others

432
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,760
I don't have

433
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,080
Please give it

434
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:30,360
- I'll give you more money
- Everyone gives that

435
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,160
You give me something else

436
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,520
Something else?

437
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,480
That means...

438
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,120
Kiss me like him

439
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,880
Hey, idiot

440
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,520
Hey Jhansi...
what are you doing?

441
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:50,480
- What's this nonsense?
- Jhansi

442
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,320
Act upon your words
Give it

443
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,040
Take it

444
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,120
See you, brother

445
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,960
- What's this, Jhansi?
- Relax, dear

446
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,400
Just one kiss

447
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,400
The kissing issue blew up
into a major issue

448
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,480
Hello

449
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,640
- Kareem...
- Yes, Edison

450
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,480
Your drug delivery boys...

451
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,040
Call Raja

452
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,000
Hello, where are you?

453
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,160
- At home, bro
- Will call you back

454
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,960
They are home

455
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,520
Ask them to not to leave

456
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:45,000
Henceforth I will take
care of party deliveries

457
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,600
She is a pro in kissing

458
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,280
A great opportunity

459
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,680
She was too good

460
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,080
Luck chap you are

461
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,760
We had no luck

462
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,880
Brother...

463
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,840
You want a kiss from minister's daughter?

464
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,760
You are paid for the job, right?

465
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,840
Why don't you get
married and settle down?

466
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,920
If you are too horny, you have
hundreds of places in the city

467
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,360
Why don't you quench
your thirst over there?

468
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,360
Why are you mixing up
with the business?

469
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,160
They are our source of business

470
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:26,680
Do you think they will spare
us, if we lust on their girl?

471
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,680
Dispose the mongrel

472
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,520
They presumed that it
was the end of the story

473
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:40,040
But the kissing issue...

474
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,880
got leaked to the media

475
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:48,280
A video clip of the daughter of Mr Manimaran
who claim to be savior of culture and decorum

476
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,320
showing her, drugged in a private party

477
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:56,800
and kissing a guy is spread in
the social media and has shocked the public

478
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,680
Video of minister's daughter taking
drugs in a party has been found

479
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:02,480
We suspect the involvement of Lala and
Rawther in this, what do you say?

480
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,520
No comments

481
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,320
The scape-goat for the cops that
was sacrificed in the place of Raja...

482
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,280
was Ibrahim

483
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:24,720
What was the sin committed
by my husband?

484
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,280
He did no wrong

485
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,440
Then why was he punished?

486
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,120
It's because of something he possessed

487
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,400
Possession?

488
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,360
What's that?

489
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:39,320
Something that he will own till his death

490
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,080
His possession

491
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,640
Me?

492
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:03,440
Rawther's second son Hussain...

493
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,680
fell in love with you

494
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,680
So in the pretext of
meeting Ibrahim...

495
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,000
Hussain comes to meet you

496
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,320
Ibrahim...

497
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,160
Ibrahim...

498
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,960
- Yes?
- Is Ibrahim home?

499
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,920
He had left for the office

500
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:25,920
- Didn't he come?
- I came to this locality on business...

501
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,280
So I came to say 'Hi'

502
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,320
Let Ibrahim know about my visit

503
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,400
Brother...

504
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,240
Come here...

505
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,200
2 lakh rupees

506
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,840
Buy the stationeries for the kids

507
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,400
No thanks

508
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,040
It's earned from a sinful job

509
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,240
Give me Rs10 earned honestly...

510
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,640
Allah shall accept it

511
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,720
- Move
- Call me for any help

512
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,320
Such a beauty she is

513
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:13,920
I have no interest in other girls
after seeing her

514
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:16,920
- Have to feast on her
- You mongrel...

515
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,240
Aren't you ashamed?

516
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,080
You are ogling at someone else's wife

517
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,800
Filthy animals are
known for such acts

518
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,160
Start the engine

519
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:28,320
Boss and Kareem rebuked him
for his immoral desire

520
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:32,080
As everyone fired on his acts...

521
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,840
Hussain felt ashamed

522
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:36,200
He cuts his hand

523
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,080
Here, drink this

524
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,680
I can't digest this

525
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,880
It's not wrong to fall in
love with our employee

526
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,640
But he wants to woo someone's wife

527
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,520
- I'll slay you
- Kareem!

528
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,880
Yes, Lala

529
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,000
Within 2 days?

530
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,320
- What's his problem?
- Media is pressuring

531
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,880
Minister is pressurizing to

532
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,040
They want a men readied for encounter

533
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,760
Raja might have been used

534
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,680
I'm confused

535
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,800
Shall we make him the scape-goat?

536
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,240
Staring?

537
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,120
Ibrahim!

538
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,880
Let him make the scape-goat

539
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,160
Come on, brother

540
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,960
Let's go to the police station

541
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,240
Let's complaint against them

542
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,000
Let us get them penalized

543
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,600
Will you give a testimony?

544
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,000
Yes...of course I will

545
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,440
If they weren't present

546
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,280
I would have given the testimony

547
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,880
Politicians...

548
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,480
Officials...

549
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,040
Criminals...

550
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:10,160
Are working in harmony

551
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,800
They turn 'wrong' into 'right'

552
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:16,520
Only rich can get the justice

553
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:20,960
We ourselves have to
earn our justice

554
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,360
Can you get me a gun?

555
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,000
You are getting old

556
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,080
When are you planning
to get married?

557
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,440
Like an orphan
that too in this place

558
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:41,760
My marriage will happen
in presence of everyone in Madras

559
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,520
You've been saying the
same since 15 years

560
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:47,880
That you will take me
to Madras and marry me

561
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:51,120
- I'll leave
- When will you come again?

562
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,320
Call me
I'll come anytime

563
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,320
Sir!

564
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,120
Bhaskar!

565
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,560
Hmmm
Come in

566
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:19,080
Aren't you Salim's wife?

567
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,480
Sir?!

568
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,760
We need to talk

569
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,280
Sure talk

570
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,840
Let's do while we talk

571
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,440
Mr Abdulla from
Chennai has sent me

572
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:34,320
In Madras? Is it the Abdulla
working under Rawther?

573
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,320
Sit

574
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,320
I need a help from you

575
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,240
I want to kill three people

576
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,480
I need your help to do it

577
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,400
Why should I help you?

578
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:04,800
My enemy is your enemy

579
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,200
Who's your enemy?

580
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,440
Rawther and his two sons

581
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,600
What's your issue with them?

582
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,600
My deepest condolence
for your loss

583
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:56,160
But...

584
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,400
Do you think you
can revenge them?

585
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:01,840
People you're talking
about are big gangsters

586
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,360
If the plan misses

587
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,440
Even if they know your motive

588
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:08,960
they won't just kill you
but your entire family too

589
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,840
I don't have any relatives

590
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:16,960
I don't have any other
business than killing them

591
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:26,560
Meet me tomorrow at 11 AM

592
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,880
Why did you name me Raziya?

593
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:50,000
Raziya Sultana

594
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:55,760
In the presence of many Kings
with her valor and wisdom

595
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,400
She was a tigress
who ruled Delhi

596
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:36,800
What? New to this business?

597
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:40,200
A girl in this business?

598
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,960
How could she be a new one?

599
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,240
Who are you?

600
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,680
Boxy Brother...

601
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:46,720
He's sleeping

602
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:49,160
He gave an appointment
at 11'o clock

603
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,440
- Appointment?
- Yes

604
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,520
To have fun?!

605
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:53,560
Shut up!

606
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:54,600
Come here

607
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:55,720
Go

608
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:01,920
What is it?

609
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:03,440
Very important

610
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:05,000
I'm coming from Chennai

611
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:07,000
Tell him Raziya is here
He'll recognize

612
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:08,440
He told me to come

613
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,320
Go

614
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Boxy Brother!

615
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:18,280
Boxy Brother!

616
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,800
A girl is here to meet you

617
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:23,440
Her name is Raziya

618
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:25,160
I'm coming

619
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,640
You are on time at 11'o clock

620
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,040
Do you love your husband much?

621
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:50,440
Brother

622
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:53,040
- The Rajkot party...
- Later

623
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,160
Did you eat?

624
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,040
I did

625
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:00,520
Have a seat

626
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:05,320
Brother

627
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,040
What will you pay me
if I help you?

628
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,720
Ask anything except me, Brother

629
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,000
Why?

630
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:27,720
I'm here because
a guy wanted me

631
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,280
I don't want you in my hit list

632
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:34,720
Funny

633
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:37,760
She'll add me in
her list she seems

634
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:52,680
Do you want to join in her list?

635
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:59,000
Go ahead

636
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,760
- Abdul had called
- What is it?

637
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:45,560
He told to keep her with us

638
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:46,800
Let's keep her

639
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:49,920
One of our men is
working for Rawther

640
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,040
Who's it?

641
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:12,040
Are you scared of blood?

642
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:19,160
Ah!

643
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:57,880
If you get used to shooting
this will be like a game

644
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:00,520
But you don't get
another life like a game

645
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:06,400
No more training is
required for you

646
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:09,320
- Then I'll go to Chennai
- And then?

647
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,680
I'm going to shoot at
Rawther and his two sons

648
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:16,800
Come here

649
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:28,840
Where are we going?

650
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:31,000
Theory class is over
Now it is time for practicals

651
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:32,800
Who is it?
Your enemy?

652
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:34,600
There are no enemies here

653
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:36,720
Girls and addiction
are just materials

654
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:37,680
Just things

655
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:41,120
- One who wants to enjoy succeeds
- Boxy

656
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:42,920
- What?
- In here?

657
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,840
Come, let me tell you

658
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,720
How are you, brother?

659
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:51,120
Three vada pav

660
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:58,360
Take the pistol

661
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,760
Without knowing who it is...

662
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:02,200
why should we shoot him Brother?

663
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:04,880
Shall we shoot him after
considering his astrology?

664
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:08,560
Shoot!

665
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:12,600
Shoot!

666
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:14,960
Shoot!

667
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:21,240
Shoot!

668
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:24,960
Kill him!

669
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,560
I'd have been dead
if there was slight delay

670
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:42,280
Why were you sitting still?

671
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:44,480
I went blank for a second

672
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:46,480
That second is
enough to get you killed

673
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:48,040
You don't have time to
think before you shoot

674
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:49,680
Think after you shoot

675
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:55,320
How will you shoot them in Madras if
you can't even shoot a mule?

676
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:01,560
I've been trying since 12 years

677
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:05,200
but you think it's like
going shopping to shoot them

678
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:09,160
Do you know what heroin is?

679
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:11,240
It's a white powder

680
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:15,520
You get high for 2 hours
if you snort a single gram

681
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:20,120
The person who sells
it get a lot of money

682
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:22,920
Major part of heroin
comes from Afghan to India

683
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,840
From Pakistan via
Punjab and Thar desert

684
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:27,360
via Gujarat coastal

685
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:30,200
via Ran of Kutch these
heroin make way to Chennai

686
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:32,000
by Ashok Saet

687
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:34,720
From there to middle of
the sea to Andaman by boat

688
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:35,760
then get delivered to

689
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:37,400
Thailand, Malaysia

690
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,800
and other countries
in that area

691
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:42,520
Similarly to Colombo
via Thoothukudi

692
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:45,760
and then to Australia and
Hong Kong in ship containers

693
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:47,800
It's starting price in Pakistan

694
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:49,080
is $3

695
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:50,520
180 Rupees

696
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:52,600
600 Rupees when
it reaches India

697
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:55,320
7000 Rupees when delivered from
Chennai in International waters

698
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,960
If the profit is
6000 Rupees per gram

699
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,560
it's approximately 6 million
Rupees per kilogram

700
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:04,200
They exchange around
500 kg easily per month

701
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:07,000
One month profit alone
makes 3 billion Rupees

702
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:09,040
Calculate it for a year

703
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:12,000
An election of
a state can be conducted

704
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:17,200
Minister Tamilvanan is
the supporting boss for them

705
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:19,520
His earnings are
entirely from this

706
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:21,680
He never accepts
bribe otherwise

707
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:26,160
So the entire Tamil Nadu believes
him as a honest politician

708
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:28,280
50% of the profit goes to him

709
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:31,160
There are three departments
in this drug business

710
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:33,000
Manufacturer,
Middle man and carrier boys

711
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:35,240
Pakistan team is
the manufacturer

712
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:37,280
Ashok saet is the middle man

713
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:38,560
Myself and Rawther are

714
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:39,880
the carrier boys

715
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,600
Once we used to sell smuggled
goods in Burma Bazaar

716
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:46,720
Then we got Lala's
connection through Edison

717
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:47,880
and became carrier boys

718
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:49,480
Too much money

719
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:50,880
It keeps coming

720
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:54,040
Even siblings fight over money

721
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:55,720
So much money

722
00:55:57,080 --> 00:56:00,320
Rawther planned to kill
me to take all the money

723
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:01,800
I escaped to this place

724
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:05,920
You want to kill now is a international
network with monstrous power

725
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:09,480
Everyone will come to help for
even a single person's problem

726
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:12,240
Father and the sons should
be attacked at the same time

727
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:15,080
If we plan to attack
them individually

728
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:16,480
the game would be over for us

729
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:17,800
Do you understand?

730
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:19,320
You start to Madras

731
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:22,200
Stay where I say to

732
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:24,400
Few of my men are there

733
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:26,080
They'll take care of you

734
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:37,000
Greetings Madam
Mr Boxy sent me

735
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:39,600
Here, hold this bag

736
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:53,840
Boxy!

737
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:55,840
Why did you accommodate
the girl here?

738
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:57,480
How's she helpful to us?

739
00:57:57,920 --> 00:57:59,480
She is an additional baggage

740
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:01,320
Rawther's boys are

741
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:03,920
already searching for
your acquaintance

742
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:07,640
If she's with us at this time
it's like digging our own trap

743
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:09,280
I know how to make use of her

744
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:10,600
Let her stay there

745
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:40,520
Buy four biriyanis

746
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:05,920
Hey dude!

747
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:07,720
Do you know who's that?

748
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:14,880
I think they shot her husband

749
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:16,160
Is it so?

750
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:41,480
Baskar!

751
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:58,560
Sir, Ibrahim whom we
killed in an encounter

752
00:59:58,600 --> 00:59:59,880
she's his wife

753
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:17,600
Look!

754
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:21,200
She is here to avenge
her husband's death

755
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:41,680
'Gangs of Madras'

756
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:01,520
Brother

757
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:03,680
Two cops were killed
in the market

758
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:08,280
Our guys are inquiring about it

759
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:11,360
Bold enough to kill cops!

760
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:15,040
Beware about it, Kareem!

761
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:22,400
Boxy

762
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:23,640
Baskar had called

763
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:24,800
What is it?

764
01:03:26,120 --> 01:03:29,200
That girl killed
two cops in public

765
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:35,880
Cops are searching for her

766
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:43,520
She's not attending the call

767
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:45,240
Handover the phone to Baskar

768
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:48,160
Entire public was watching

769
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:50,080
Body was in the
opposite direction

770
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:53,040
She then casually resumed
eating her biriyani

771
01:03:57,080 --> 01:03:58,280
Baskar

772
01:03:58,320 --> 01:03:59,520
Where is the girl?

773
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:01,240
Tell her to attend the call

774
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:02,520
Razi

775
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:12,680
Raziya

776
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:14,800
Boxy has been calling
you for hours

777
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:16,720
Please talk to him

778
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:22,640
Okay you leave
I'll talk to him

779
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:31,200
Brother

780
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:33,480
Hey! Are you crazy?

781
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:35,680
Why did you kill
the cops in public?

782
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:36,720
Sorry brother

783
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:39,320
I couldn't control
myself when I saw them

784
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:40,320
Raziya

785
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:41,560
It has begun

786
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:43,800
They might have
started digging deep

787
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:45,240
Rawther has aged up

788
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:46,320
Hussain is useless

789
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:48,240
Kareem is the only wise
guy on their side

790
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:50,560
We should kill Kareem before
they're realize the scheme

791
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:52,040
Kareem means not just him

792
01:04:52,360 --> 01:04:54,360
Including the six
people around him

793
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:56,520
Even if a single person escapes

794
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:58,480
Hussain will escape too

795
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:12,840
Baskar

796
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:29,280
Brother!
Where will be Kareem tomorrow?

797
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,760
Be ready with eight bikes
We have a job tomorrow

798
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:43,920
Not tomorrow?

799
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:45,400
Why?

800
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:49,080
Let's take some
time to be ready

801
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:50,280
Do as I say

802
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:31,080
One minute

803
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:32,120
Murthi

804
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:35,320
Yeah

805
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:37,280
Father is not here

806
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:40,960
Should I come for such
trivial matters too?

807
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,000
These many years...

808
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:44,200
Hey

809
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:53,560
Hey!

810
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:21,360
What is it, Edison?

811
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:25,920
Who?

812
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:26,800
When?

813
01:11:57,600 --> 01:11:59,400
She's not a girl but a ghost

814
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:01,040
How does she plan it?

815
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:02,240
Boxy

816
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:04,480
I thought she just use bottles

817
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:07,640
She's throwing petrol,
screws and nails

818
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:08,880
She didn't miss anything

819
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:12,040
He suffered a lot when nail
pierced his burnt skin

820
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:14,040
But one thing for sure Boxy

821
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:16,640
We should never
become her enemy

822
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:20,840
Is it so?

823
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:22,520
Handover the phone to Raziya

824
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:23,560
Okay

825
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,080
Raziya! Boxy is online

826
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:34,960
Brother

827
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:38,200
The happiest things is when
it happens as you wished

828
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:42,000
They're seriously
searching for the murderer

829
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:43,480
Beware

830
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:27,200
Hello sir

831
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:29,560
Autopsy is done

832
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:31,600
He is hit by many bottles

833
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:35,160
Rusty screws and nails where thrown
on him with burning petrol bottles

834
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:40,600
I think they added up
tiny plastic pieces along

835
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:43,320
He had many traces of
sulphuric acid on his body

836
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:45,040
That means he was
attacked with acids too

837
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:46,400
49 nails in total

838
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:47,400
9 screws

839
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:48,600
103 pieces of glass

840
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:50,240
These were the things
removed from his body

841
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:51,560
And 100% burns too

842
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:54,160
Even the punishments in
hell can't be this severe

843
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:55,760
A very tragic death

844
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:58,000
- Horrible
- When can I collect the reports?

845
01:13:58,040 --> 01:14:00,440
Collect the reports
by tomorrow evening

846
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:11,120
Collect the body after
police formalities

847
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:16,560
Yaasim

848
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:23,560
All the rascals who did this
should be dead before dawn

849
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,040
Don't take hasty decisions, Rawther

850
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:27,440
Two cops yesterday

851
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:28,960
Today it's Kareem

852
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:30,840
It looks like someone
had it well planned

853
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:34,840
Someone has got the courage
where none had it for 30 years

854
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:36,600
We have to be careful about it

855
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,440
- Edison
- Yes

856
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:39,880
Call the Minister

857
01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:43,440
Tell him not to involve
any cops in this matter

858
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:44,720
- Okay
- Let's handle this

859
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:45,760
Okay Lala

860
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:48,920
Kareem has been killed

861
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:51,920
They've taken six
guys out of my gang

862
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:54,440
How can I spare them Saet?

863
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:57,680
If we start hunting
without any details

864
01:14:57,760 --> 01:14:58,920
it will turn out as a gang war

865
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,320
where our own guys
will kill each other

866
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:02,640
Be passive

867
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:05,320
1 billion value stuff
has arrived at Nellore

868
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:06,720
We have to pick it up

869
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:07,960
Arrange for it

870
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,000
I'll leave

871
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:16,040
What is it father?
Brother is dead

872
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:17,800
But yet they care
only about the stuffs

873
01:15:24,280 --> 01:15:25,280
Hello

874
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:26,080
Sir

875
01:15:26,160 --> 01:15:27,800
This looks like a gang war, sir

876
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:29,160
They've had their
revenge well planned

877
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:32,800
We will have to enquire Lala and
Rawther if we proceed further, sir

878
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:35,640
Tamilvanan has ordered
not to care much about it

879
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:39,320
If it looks like a gang war,
just monitor them closely and inform me

880
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:40,840
Let them fight to
death themselves

881
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:44,080
Human rights will question us
if we do something about it

882
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:45,880
Okay, sir

883
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:48,320
What is our purpose if
they fight to death

884
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:49,760
Start the vehicle

885
01:16:30,240 --> 01:16:34,280
We couldn't even see his
face because of them

886
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:41,760
We can't leave it Rawther

887
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:43,080
We've a lot of work

888
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:44,520
We have to move forward

889
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:46,400
It's been around a week already

890
01:16:47,240 --> 01:16:50,000
Nothing will be done until
finding who killed my brother

891
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:06,960
I'll leave

892
01:17:12,240 --> 01:17:16,080
He's doesn't even know what
to talk at a mourning house

893
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:35,200
Stuff has to be picked
up from Nellore tomorrow

894
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:39,120
Rawther is upset
after Kareem's death

895
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:42,160
Hussain is totally useless

896
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:47,280
Boxy called up

897
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:53,680
What to do!

898
01:17:53,720 --> 01:17:57,080
We can't stop our
work for others' loss

899
01:18:01,480 --> 01:18:03,360
I'll ask him to do it
if it's okay with you

900
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:19,320
One minute

901
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:22,000
- Yes, Edison
- Hello!

902
01:18:22,040 --> 01:18:23,320
Lala has agreed

903
01:18:24,240 --> 01:18:25,760
You start the work Boxy

904
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:28,080
You're working with
Rawther for 30 years

905
01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:30,680
If I'm in Rawther's position...

906
01:18:30,720 --> 01:18:32,200
...then I'll work

907
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:33,640
Hold on

908
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:37,960
He wants to sole handler
of Madras' business

909
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:45,440
Okay Boxy

910
01:18:45,480 --> 01:18:46,760
Lala approved

911
01:18:50,280 --> 01:18:51,960
- What is it?
- Madras is mine

912
01:19:03,720 --> 01:19:06,560
- Take good care of it
- You too

913
01:19:06,720 --> 01:19:07,720
Okay

914
01:19:07,880 --> 01:19:09,840
Give me a tea
I'm starving since morning

915
01:19:09,880 --> 01:19:11,040
I'm hungry

916
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:12,160
You look healthy

917
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:13,240
Earn it

918
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:14,720
Don't beg
Get lost

919
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:16,560
Else I will splash hot water

920
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:17,960
Get lost

921
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:22,360
Help if you can or stay away

922
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:23,720
Don't advise

923
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:25,240
Will you employ him?

924
01:19:27,720 --> 01:19:29,160
- Thank you so much
- Eat

925
01:19:35,320 --> 01:19:37,280
- Tea would've been better
- Hello

926
01:19:37,720 --> 01:19:39,640
Lala agreed to
handover Madras to me

927
01:19:40,040 --> 01:19:42,640
They are shocked
because of your attack

928
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:44,760
There is a task tomorrow

929
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:46,880
We're the big shots
if that's complete

930
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:49,280
No more Edison or
Lala with Rawther

931
01:19:49,320 --> 01:19:51,640
Let's kill Rawther
after our work tomorrow

932
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:54,840
You used me for
your selfishness

933
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:59,760
Is this the reason you wanted to
kill his men along with Kareem

934
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:03,920
I just want to kill everyone
responsible for my husband's death

935
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:04,880
That's it

936
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:07,640
I don't want Madras or anything

937
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:10,960
I won't do this drug shit

938
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:11,800
Raziya

939
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:13,000
The trained you had

940
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:14,440
The pistol you own

941
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:16,400
People who helped
you to kill Kareem

942
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:18,360
Everything came from the drugs

943
01:20:18,440 --> 01:20:21,080
I planned it well to kill
Kareem and him men together

944
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:23,360
I've been trying since 15 years

945
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:24,960
I used you when you came

946
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,120
You want to kill three of them
I want Madras

947
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:29,320
I thought of giving you a
share since you are with me

948
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:30,480
Leave if you don't want it

949
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:32,160
My men will do it

950
01:20:32,240 --> 01:20:33,760
You just mind your business

951
01:20:49,960 --> 01:20:51,920
Didn't you get any
other decent jobs?

952
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:55,800
Aren't you aware that you're
doing a immoral business?

953
01:20:56,080 --> 01:20:58,000
Your family is in
danger because of you

954
01:20:58,040 --> 01:20:59,160
Do you know that?

955
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:01,720
Who defines
a good business?

956
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:04,080
It's wrong to artificially prepare
toddy in our place

957
01:21:04,120 --> 01:21:05,520
We will be nabbed

958
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:08,880
But in Kerala the
government sells toddy

959
01:21:08,920 --> 01:21:12,320
In Canada the government
sends marijuana in post

960
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:14,920
All drugs are legal
in Netherland

961
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:19,240
In most of the countries
prostitution is a legal business

962
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:22,040
But here it's
disgusting and wrong

963
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:27,160
The good and bad
laws are subjective

964
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:30,320
The requirement is the virtue

965
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:33,240
I come from an agricultural family...

966
01:21:33,320 --> 01:21:34,320
I'm suffering here

967
01:21:34,360 --> 01:21:37,760
People buy drinking
water for 50 rupees

968
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:41,400
But they bargain our
agricultural goods

969
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:42,480
This is the condition here

970
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:44,040
No good earning

971
01:21:44,160 --> 01:21:47,160
His wife eloped with another
guy for luxurious life

972
01:21:47,240 --> 01:21:51,080
But he is now in his 45
as he wanted his marriage

973
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:53,760
to get settled in his life

974
01:21:53,880 --> 01:21:55,920
Now he lost his appetite

975
01:21:56,160 --> 01:22:00,840
People providing money for unethical
interests suck people's blood for money

976
01:22:00,920 --> 01:22:02,680
This isn't bad when
compared to them

977
01:22:02,720 --> 01:22:04,360
Even though getting their salary

978
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:05,680
they demand bribe

979
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:07,320
This is better than them

980
01:22:07,640 --> 01:22:09,360
This money is not unethical

981
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:11,280
than the robbery in the
name of school fees

982
01:22:11,320 --> 01:22:13,520
We risk our lives
for this money

983
01:22:13,560 --> 01:22:15,040
Money is everything here

984
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:17,480
Anything seems good
enough to earn money

985
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:20,280
Then you can become a
messiah of education

986
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:23,160
a politician, a Philanthropist

987
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:27,520
People who called them a criminal
would call them with respect

988
01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:01,440
Greetings brother

989
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:02,800
Hey Beemudu

990
01:24:02,840 --> 01:24:04,360
- Yes brother
- Take it

991
01:24:27,480 --> 01:24:31,160
Brother! Lala is transporting the
stuff from Nellore using Boxy's guys

992
01:24:43,680 --> 01:24:44,680
Boxy!

993
01:24:45,240 --> 01:24:48,360
Guys took the stuff
delivery from Nellore

994
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:49,800
Are they safe?

995
01:24:49,880 --> 01:24:51,360
Yes, they're safe

996
01:25:38,280 --> 01:25:39,520
Is it so?

997
01:25:39,640 --> 01:25:40,680
Okay

998
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:23,800
Lala! Okay

999
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:29,880
Boxy

1000
01:26:29,960 --> 01:26:31,160
Stuffs has been received

1001
01:26:31,200 --> 01:26:33,160
Hold on
Lala wants to talk to you

1002
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:39,480
Boxy

1003
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:41,440
Lala

1004
01:26:41,480 --> 01:26:43,280
Madras is yours, Boxy

1005
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:45,800
Thank you!

1006
01:26:50,360 --> 01:26:52,000
Madras!

1007
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:56,200
Boxy!

1008
01:26:56,320 --> 01:26:57,800
I'm going home

1009
01:26:58,840 --> 01:26:59,880
Going home

1010
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:01,360
Going now

1011
01:29:47,480 --> 01:29:48,680
As told, in 10 days...

1012
01:29:48,720 --> 01:29:51,360
everyone responsible for
your son's death were killed

1013
01:29:55,680 --> 01:29:58,320
Lala, Minister Tamilvanan's P.A.
here

1014
01:29:58,360 --> 01:30:00,080
The pistols used for
killing those two cops

1015
01:30:00,120 --> 01:30:02,000
were imported,
says the Commissioner

1016
01:30:02,040 --> 01:30:03,000
German make

1017
01:30:03,080 --> 01:30:04,360
P99

1018
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:07,000
In Tamil Nadu, low level rowdies...

1019
01:30:07,040 --> 01:30:09,720
can't access imported pistols
says the Commissioner

1020
01:30:09,800 --> 01:30:11,680
It should've been either
a link with a terrorist

1021
01:30:11,720 --> 01:30:14,640
or anyone who came
involving from Mumbai

1022
01:30:14,720 --> 01:30:17,000
Since Kareem was killed
immediately the next day

1023
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:22,080
the Commissioner says that a local
gang accessed weapon from Mumbai

1024
01:30:22,160 --> 01:30:24,960
You enquire through
your contacts in Mumbai

1025
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:30,040
Also the information says a girl was
involved in the killing of the cops

1026
01:30:30,080 --> 01:30:31,720
- Take care
- Okay

1027
01:30:39,800 --> 01:30:41,120
Hello

1028
01:30:41,200 --> 01:30:42,520
Tell me brother

1029
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:44,440
I need an important information

1030
01:30:44,520 --> 01:30:46,200
Did any gang from Madras

1031
01:30:46,240 --> 01:30:48,320
establish contact in Mumbai?

1032
01:30:48,760 --> 01:30:52,080
Did anyone new purchased
German P99 pistol?

1033
01:30:52,600 --> 01:30:55,120
Especially check if any
girl has been involved

1034
01:30:55,160 --> 01:30:56,680
- in this matter
- Okay

1035
01:30:56,720 --> 01:30:59,480
- I'll call you when I get details
- Okay

1036
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:24,400
Lala, you know Boxy, right?

1037
01:31:24,440 --> 01:31:26,840
A Madras girl is with him

1038
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:29,480
Boxy trained her with
kick boxing and firing

1039
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:33,320
Came here two months back
Nobody now knows her whereabouts

1040
01:31:33,400 --> 01:31:34,560
This is the information, Lala

1041
01:31:34,600 --> 01:31:36,520
I'll call you if I
get to know more

1042
01:31:37,680 --> 01:31:38,800
Okay

1043
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:44,400
Boxy, planned the killing
of Kareem and Rawther guys...

1044
01:31:44,440 --> 01:31:46,480
and works for us
like an innocent

1045
01:31:48,120 --> 01:31:50,600
We've killed his own
people through himself

1046
01:31:51,160 --> 01:31:52,600
Bloody...

1047
01:31:52,680 --> 01:31:55,240
He's happy that
Madras belongs to him

1048
01:31:57,520 --> 01:32:00,360
I thought of revealing
you my plan last, Edison

1049
01:32:02,760 --> 01:32:05,400
Were you able to know
who that girl is, Lala?

1050
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:14,760
Please leave him

1051
01:32:16,880 --> 01:32:18,880
He didn't do anything

1052
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:23,440
Please leave him

1053
01:32:23,480 --> 01:32:24,880
He has no idea

1054
01:32:27,880 --> 01:32:30,520
- Listen! Don't be stubborn
- Please don't hurt him

1055
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:33,800
Your wife's dress is
not in a good shape

1056
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,480
I can't control my guys

1057
01:32:36,600 --> 01:32:38,400
If you reveal the truth yourself

1058
01:32:38,480 --> 01:32:40,440
we'll just kill you
and leave from here

1059
01:32:40,520 --> 01:32:41,560
Tell me

1060
01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:44,400
Raziya killed Kareem

1061
01:32:44,440 --> 01:32:46,080
- Ah!
- Who's that?

1062
01:32:46,160 --> 01:32:49,160
Ibrahim,
who was killed in an encounter,

1063
01:32:49,200 --> 01:32:50,920
Rawther's guy,

1064
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:52,000
She's his wife

1065
01:32:52,040 --> 01:32:55,480
Since Rawther planned
for his encounter,

1066
01:32:55,520 --> 01:32:59,480
she wants to avenge
his entire family

1067
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:03,400
Boxy, used her for his plans

1068
01:33:03,440 --> 01:33:05,520
This is what I know

1069
01:33:05,720 --> 01:33:07,560
- Leave me
- Hello

1070
01:33:08,440 --> 01:33:11,840
Lala, he claims that
this is what he knows

1071
01:33:13,880 --> 01:33:15,080
Okay

1072
01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:19,440
Please don't hurt him

1073
01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:21,240
Please leave him

1074
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:22,600
Dear!

1075
01:33:24,760 --> 01:33:27,360
Hey! She might come
to avenge us too

1076
01:33:27,400 --> 01:33:30,400
- So Lala ordered to hill her too
- Please leave me

1077
01:33:30,440 --> 01:33:32,280
Let me go to my mother's place

1078
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:43,400
Gifting someone's
wife to your son

1079
01:33:43,520 --> 01:33:45,720
Is becoming a pimp to your own son

1080
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:53,960
Once a big kingdoms were
destroyed someday, brother

1081
01:33:54,360 --> 01:33:57,200
See how many lives has been
lost for your son's desire

1082
01:33:57,280 --> 01:33:59,680
In spite of kidnapping
and enjoying her

1083
01:33:59,720 --> 01:34:01,800
You've taken a long way around

1084
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,440
How did Raziya come
to know about it?

1085
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:09,520
Not from any external sources

1086
01:34:09,880 --> 01:34:12,600
It should've been your men

1087
01:34:14,720 --> 01:34:16,880
End this and start
working, brother

1088
01:34:16,920 --> 01:34:18,160
Leave

1089
01:34:37,360 --> 01:34:38,320
Ibrahim

1090
01:34:38,360 --> 01:34:40,480
Let's ask them to kill
Ibrahim in an encounter

1091
01:34:49,160 --> 01:34:50,360
Did you get the seat?

1092
01:34:50,440 --> 01:34:52,520
- Yes father
- Brother

1093
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:53,960
He's smart

1094
01:34:59,800 --> 01:35:01,960
They have inferred everything

1095
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:04,720
Boxy's men killed everyone

1096
01:35:04,840 --> 01:35:06,880
Boxy might be in danger

1097
01:35:06,920 --> 01:35:09,280
You be safe somewhere

1098
01:35:09,360 --> 01:35:11,600
Tell him to be safe too

1099
01:35:22,640 --> 01:35:23,720
- Abdul
- Brother

1100
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:24,840
Give the phone

1101
01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:26,920
Give me brother

1102
01:35:40,440 --> 01:35:41,640
Yes, brother

1103
01:35:44,600 --> 01:35:46,200
I'll tell you

1104
01:35:51,120 --> 01:35:52,400
Get in

1105
01:36:52,320 --> 01:36:55,000
Since how long are you
working with me, Abdul?

1106
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:56,200
Around

1107
01:36:56,320 --> 01:36:58,160
35 years, brother

1108
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:02,880
Though I was bad to
others, these many years

1109
01:37:03,520 --> 01:37:05,560
I was good to you

1110
01:37:06,400 --> 01:37:10,080
I've been a friend to you
in every past aspects

1111
01:37:11,360 --> 01:37:13,800
Then why did you do this, Abdul?

1112
01:37:16,840 --> 01:37:19,640
If I've betrayed Ibrahim

1113
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:23,000
What have you done to me?

1114
01:37:25,720 --> 01:37:28,920
I don't want to punish
you the usual way...

1115
01:37:29,480 --> 01:37:31,560
to who betrays in our business

1116
01:37:32,240 --> 01:37:34,160
Don't bother me

1117
01:37:34,520 --> 01:37:36,400
The ball is in your court

1118
01:37:37,800 --> 01:37:40,000
Brother! Please let me...

1119
01:37:43,920 --> 01:37:45,760
Turn around Abdul

1120
01:37:45,920 --> 01:37:47,920
I can't see you cry

1121
01:38:24,400 --> 01:38:25,360
Greetings, brother

1122
01:38:25,400 --> 01:38:27,840
Brother will make a good
decision himself

1123
01:38:32,440 --> 01:38:34,080
Call me in an hour

1124
01:38:34,120 --> 01:38:35,400
Okay, brother

1125
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:22,080
Dear

1126
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:26,600
Abdulla brother has
committed suicide

1127
01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:52,440
Long live Minister Tamilvanan!

1128
01:41:52,520 --> 01:41:54,800
Long live Minister Tamilvanan!

1129
01:41:54,840 --> 01:41:56,280
If he's arrested

1130
01:41:56,360 --> 01:41:58,680
- Who'll fund for the election?
- Good Morning, sir

1131
01:42:00,240 --> 01:42:01,640
I'll take care, sir

1132
01:42:06,560 --> 01:42:09,480
Sir, there's been 9
murders last night alone

1133
01:42:09,880 --> 01:42:12,040
If we don't mind
it as a gang war

1134
01:42:12,080 --> 01:42:13,920
everyone will start the
same, sir

1135
01:42:14,080 --> 01:42:16,280
Rawther's team is
responsible for everything

1136
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:18,440
It was a revenge
for Kareem's murder

1137
01:42:19,040 --> 01:42:21,960
And the information says
Lala has involved too

1138
01:42:22,400 --> 01:42:24,760
We need to take some
immediate action sir

1139
01:42:24,800 --> 01:42:26,480
It's becoming
sensitive every minute

1140
01:42:26,520 --> 01:42:29,480
If we arrest Rawther
for this case...

1141
01:42:29,520 --> 01:42:32,560
drug supply in the
city can be controlled

1142
01:42:32,920 --> 01:42:36,040
If you approve we can
catch Rawther, sir

1143
01:42:39,800 --> 01:42:42,040
Memes are insulting
us now a days

1144
01:42:42,080 --> 01:42:44,040
Arrest the one who created it

1145
01:42:44,080 --> 01:42:45,760
You don't do that

1146
01:42:46,400 --> 01:42:47,440
Sir

1147
01:42:47,840 --> 01:42:51,320
Drug usage in the city
is increasing every day

1148
01:42:51,400 --> 01:42:53,760
Hence the law and
order problems

1149
01:42:54,760 --> 01:42:58,240
Youngsters are attacking their
parents for money to buy drugs

1150
01:42:58,280 --> 01:43:00,480
It's becoming
violent everywhere

1151
01:43:00,600 --> 01:43:04,000
Domestic issues are hiking too

1152
01:43:04,520 --> 01:43:06,840
Now we have evidence
against them

1153
01:43:06,960 --> 01:43:08,640
It's now easy for us
to capture them, sir

1154
01:43:08,680 --> 01:43:10,520
- Please
- Listen, Commissioner

1155
01:43:10,560 --> 01:43:12,920
Won't anyone sell or
use drugs in city...

1156
01:43:12,960 --> 01:43:15,160
 if Rawther has been arrested?

1157
01:43:15,240 --> 01:43:17,120
You too have
arrested many people

1158
01:43:17,160 --> 01:43:18,680
And did encounters

1159
01:43:18,760 --> 01:43:20,000
Ceased the drugs

1160
01:43:20,040 --> 01:43:21,320
But did the drug
trafficking reduce?

1161
01:43:21,360 --> 01:43:22,960
You've been running many
awareness programs too

1162
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:24,680
Did the drug users rate reduce?

1163
01:43:24,720 --> 01:43:26,480
All the drug users
are big shots

1164
01:43:26,560 --> 01:43:27,280
Well educated

1165
01:43:27,320 --> 01:43:29,520
Did you find about the murderer...

1166
01:43:29,560 --> 01:43:31,480
of the two cops,
couple of days before?

1167
01:43:32,120 --> 01:43:34,120
You aren't able to
find the cop killers

1168
01:43:34,160 --> 01:43:35,600
First finish that case

1169
01:43:38,440 --> 01:43:40,160
She shot those two cops

1170
01:43:40,480 --> 01:43:43,120
This murder is the counter attack
for the encounter they did

1171
01:43:43,200 --> 01:43:45,080
She's the one who
also killed Kareem

1172
01:43:45,120 --> 01:43:47,760
Either arrest her or
kill her in encounter

1173
01:43:48,920 --> 01:43:51,240
Let's deal about
arresting Rawther later

1174
01:43:53,520 --> 01:43:54,800
Okay, sir

1175
01:43:58,520 --> 01:43:59,920
Yes, okay, sir

1176
01:44:00,680 --> 01:44:03,120
- What is this, sir?
- Catch her first

1177
01:44:03,360 --> 01:44:05,000
Leave without any worries

1178
01:44:13,040 --> 01:44:14,400
We've to finish this

1179
01:44:14,480 --> 01:44:15,880
We need to hunt her

1180
01:44:15,920 --> 01:44:17,720
As soon as possible

1181
01:44:20,880 --> 01:44:23,120
Sir, actually she's
doing our duty

1182
01:44:23,160 --> 01:44:24,480
Why her, sir?

1183
01:44:24,880 --> 01:44:26,240
Act like a cop

1184
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:29,800
We should follow the
orders of our superiors

1185
01:44:30,240 --> 01:44:31,880
She had killed two of our cops

1186
01:44:31,920 --> 01:44:33,200
She's a criminal and a murderer

1187
01:44:33,240 --> 01:44:35,480
Minister is teasing us
for not catching her

1188
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:39,440
We need to hunt her

1189
01:45:02,720 --> 01:45:04,680
How many people will you
kill in a single day?

1190
01:45:04,720 --> 01:45:06,120
You crazy psychos

1191
01:45:06,520 --> 01:45:10,320
Commissioner is requesting for
permission to arrest you three

1192
01:45:10,560 --> 01:45:14,720
DC is stubborn to arrest
Rawther at least

1193
01:45:15,840 --> 01:45:18,560
It was hell before I
managed to get rid of him

1194
01:45:18,640 --> 01:45:20,040
Media isn't aware yet

1195
01:45:20,080 --> 01:45:22,880
I've ordered to catch
that girl for diversion

1196
01:45:23,440 --> 01:45:26,600
Tell you men to keep
calm even under attacks

1197
01:45:26,680 --> 01:45:28,040
Do you understand?

1198
01:45:28,440 --> 01:45:30,720
It's a sin in our
religion to burn the dead

1199
01:45:30,800 --> 01:45:32,280
Allah won't accept it

1200
01:45:32,320 --> 01:45:35,400
I've buried my son's bones, sir

1201
01:45:35,440 --> 01:45:36,880
And you ask me to be calm

1202
01:45:36,920 --> 01:45:38,240
She's roaming under her burka

1203
01:45:38,280 --> 01:45:40,080
Can your men open it?

1204
01:45:40,120 --> 01:45:41,840
But a cop can

1205
01:45:41,880 --> 01:45:45,200
The DC is waiting
to capture you all

1206
01:45:45,600 --> 01:45:47,360
If you still continue
creating problems

1207
01:45:47,440 --> 01:45:48,840
Then I can't help you

1208
01:45:49,600 --> 01:45:51,440
These all efforts
are for you Lala

1209
01:45:51,480 --> 01:45:53,600
Rawther, he's correct

1210
01:45:53,640 --> 01:45:55,760
Do nothing more about it

1211
01:45:56,480 --> 01:45:59,680
Your share for this month has
been sent to you HSBC account

1212
01:46:00,040 --> 01:46:01,640
This is not your
political party's stage...

1213
01:46:01,720 --> 01:46:03,280
to say that you can ignore us

1214
01:46:03,360 --> 01:46:04,400
If you want to skip us

1215
01:46:04,440 --> 01:46:05,480
let anyone be it

1216
01:46:05,520 --> 01:46:06,680
including myself

1217
01:46:06,720 --> 01:46:07,760
The decision remains the same

1218
01:46:07,800 --> 01:46:09,040
We'll leave

1219
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:31,360
Who's Fathima here?

1220
01:46:31,400 --> 01:46:32,520
Fathima

1221
01:46:32,640 --> 01:46:34,160
Is there, sir

1222
01:46:34,360 --> 01:46:36,320
- Fathima?
- It's me, sir

1223
01:46:36,400 --> 01:46:37,960
Do you know where Jaya is?

1224
01:46:38,920 --> 01:46:39,880
Jaya?

1225
01:46:39,920 --> 01:46:41,320
Which Jaya, sir?

1226
01:46:42,080 --> 01:46:43,960
Raziya...Ibrahim's wife

1227
01:46:45,200 --> 01:46:47,120
It's been so long
since I met her

1228
01:46:47,160 --> 01:46:49,040
She is not coming for work

1229
01:47:12,200 --> 01:47:15,800
'At Triplicane in Chennai,
in the case of 2 cops shot to death'

1230
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:19,960
'Since the prime accused Razia(Aka)Jaya,
the suspect is in the hideout'

1231
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:24,440
'Razia's parents are arrested
and investigating by Triplicane police'

1232
01:47:25,520 --> 01:47:27,240
Is this news true?

1233
01:47:36,880 --> 01:47:40,640
Since he wanted me
to get married to his son

1234
01:47:41,720 --> 01:47:45,000
They killed Ibrahim by
the name of encounter

1235
01:47:46,640 --> 01:47:48,200
This happened to me today

1236
01:47:48,280 --> 01:47:51,840
But from now on no one
should even think about it

1237
01:47:55,440 --> 01:47:58,560
She eloped from home since
8 months, sir

1238
01:47:58,760 --> 01:48:00,560
We know nothing about her

1239
01:48:00,600 --> 01:48:03,600
Tell us whatever you know about her
When did you see her last?

1240
01:48:03,640 --> 01:48:05,520
- I didn't see her
- Don't hide anything

1241
01:48:05,600 --> 01:48:08,480
- I didn't see her after marriage
- You?

1242
01:48:09,320 --> 01:48:10,920
I'm asking you

1243
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:12,240
Why do you hesitate?

1244
01:48:12,280 --> 01:48:14,040
- When did you see your daughter last?
- Hello?

1245
01:48:14,080 --> 01:48:16,520
Dear, I've received a
voice message on my phone

1246
01:48:16,560 --> 01:48:17,960
I've sent it to you

1247
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,680
Neighbours were with me
while listening to it

1248
01:48:20,760 --> 01:48:21,840
It was embarrassing

1249
01:48:21,880 --> 01:48:23,320
You listen to it alone

1250
01:48:23,360 --> 01:48:24,240
Hello

1251
01:48:24,840 --> 01:48:25,800
Listen

1252
01:48:25,840 --> 01:48:26,960
If you try to hide something

1253
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,840
then we won't be able to
help you in the future

1254
01:48:29,880 --> 01:48:31,880
We never liked what she did

1255
01:48:31,960 --> 01:48:34,320
She never came home
after marriage

1256
01:48:42,400 --> 01:48:44,240
My father didn't
attend my wedding

1257
01:48:44,280 --> 01:48:47,000
None from my home for
my husband's death

1258
01:48:47,040 --> 01:48:50,520
You know well that my
family knows nothing

1259
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:54,040
You killed my innocent
husband in an encounter

1260
01:48:54,240 --> 01:48:57,520
And now you are arresting
and torturing my family

1261
01:48:57,600 --> 01:48:59,560
If you dare...

1262
01:48:59,640 --> 01:49:02,840
arrest anyone of
those three persons

1263
01:49:03,120 --> 01:49:07,760
Else let your wife act as your
husband and you be the wife

1264
01:49:32,640 --> 01:49:33,680
What's the joke here?

1265
01:49:33,760 --> 01:49:35,840
- What's the joke here?
- Sir

1266
01:49:35,880 --> 01:49:37,400
- Are we jokers to you?
- Sir

1267
01:49:37,480 --> 01:49:38,560
No, sir

1268
01:49:50,480 --> 01:49:51,200
Yes, sir

1269
01:49:51,240 --> 01:49:55,040
Send off the parents of Raziya
after getting a statement from them

1270
01:50:27,880 --> 01:50:29,200
- Louis
- Sir

1271
01:50:32,040 --> 01:50:34,840
Increase the watch
in Rawther's area

1272
01:50:34,920 --> 01:50:37,640
You guys monitor
Rawther's godown...

1273
01:50:37,720 --> 01:50:39,840
and home very closely in mufti

1274
01:50:41,560 --> 01:50:44,800
Raziya will attempt to
kill Hussain or Rawther

1275
01:50:44,840 --> 01:50:46,200
Okay, sir

1276
01:50:47,760 --> 01:50:49,280
Once the suspect is on sight

1277
01:50:49,320 --> 01:50:51,880
- Contact me immediately
- Yes, sir

1278
01:51:14,720 --> 01:51:17,640
Hussain, your dad told that
we don't do anything to her

1279
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:20,320
And police will take care of her

1280
01:51:22,920 --> 01:51:24,000
Yaasim

1281
01:51:24,040 --> 01:51:25,400
Come to the godown

1282
01:51:50,400 --> 01:51:52,840
Yaasim, I can stay peaceful...

1283
01:51:52,880 --> 01:51:55,040
only when I destroy her

1284
01:51:55,080 --> 01:51:56,440
and torture her to death

1285
01:51:56,480 --> 01:51:58,520
Tell our guys to find her

1286
01:52:13,400 --> 01:52:15,160
- Catch her
- Hey!

1287
01:52:15,200 --> 01:52:16,400
Go

1288
01:52:16,480 --> 01:52:19,520
Hussain used to come here
often before Raziya's arrival

1289
01:52:19,560 --> 01:52:21,120
He comes to the
shop with no reason

1290
01:52:21,200 --> 01:52:22,600
Then I didn't know anything

1291
01:52:22,680 --> 01:52:26,400
You'd have been killed instead of
Ibrahim if Raziya didn't come here

1292
01:52:26,440 --> 01:52:28,160
I wouldn't have become Raziya

1293
01:52:28,200 --> 01:52:30,200
If he was back after six months

1294
01:52:30,320 --> 01:52:33,320
I'd have married him
praising him as a God

1295
01:52:33,400 --> 01:52:34,800
Worst job

1296
01:52:34,840 --> 01:52:36,560
And an owner for it
Shit

1297
01:52:42,160 --> 01:52:43,280
Hey

1298
01:52:43,440 --> 01:52:46,920
We risked our lives and believed
you to take care of our family

1299
01:52:46,960 --> 01:52:49,800
We shagged our tails
for you like a dog

1300
01:52:49,840 --> 01:52:51,920
But you betrayed us

1301
01:52:54,440 --> 01:52:55,640
Hey

1302
01:52:55,680 --> 01:52:58,000
Everyone go and
resume your works

1303
01:52:58,040 --> 01:53:00,960
He should know that
we are capable

1304
01:53:02,120 --> 01:53:03,840
Listen to me
Go

1305
01:53:03,880 --> 01:53:04,920
Go

1306
01:57:32,120 --> 01:57:34,800
Sir, Hussain went inside
the godown with his boys

1307
01:57:34,840 --> 01:57:37,440
His boys are back
except Hussain

1308
01:57:37,480 --> 01:57:38,840
Something is wrong, sir

1309
01:57:39,720 --> 01:57:40,800
I'll come

1310
01:57:40,920 --> 01:57:43,480
Try to see what's happening
inside the godown

1311
01:57:43,760 --> 01:57:44,880
Yes, sir

1312
01:58:02,640 --> 01:58:04,200
- Tell me
- Sir

1313
01:58:04,440 --> 01:58:06,240
Hussain is found dead

1314
01:58:19,360 --> 01:58:20,120
Sir

1315
01:58:20,160 --> 01:58:21,640
- Where?
- Here, sir

1316
01:59:33,080 --> 01:59:34,240
Raziya

1317
01:59:34,960 --> 01:59:37,280
We can't change
that has happened

1318
01:59:38,360 --> 01:59:40,360
God is watching over everything

1319
01:59:42,200 --> 01:59:45,600
No one guilty can
escape his punishments

1320
01:59:50,040 --> 01:59:51,480
Leave these things

1321
01:59:52,120 --> 01:59:53,480
Surrender to the cops

1322
01:59:53,520 --> 01:59:55,160
Let's follow up
the case in court

1323
01:59:55,920 --> 01:59:57,360
We are here to help

1324
02:00:03,640 --> 02:00:05,520
My mother is a spiritual person

1325
02:00:05,560 --> 02:00:07,560
Goes to temple everyday

1326
02:00:08,160 --> 02:00:10,160
She never misses any fasting

1327
02:00:11,040 --> 02:00:13,960
I used to fast
along with her too

1328
02:00:14,280 --> 02:00:16,960
I've prayed to Allah five
times a day after marriage

1329
02:00:18,640 --> 02:00:23,360
No God came to my rescue

1330
02:00:27,400 --> 02:00:29,720
You can't eat for my hunger

1331
02:00:30,080 --> 02:00:31,440
I've to ask

1332
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:33,760
for what I need

1333
02:00:34,320 --> 02:00:35,480
I will

1334
02:02:10,640 --> 02:02:11,960
Boys

1335
02:02:28,720 --> 02:02:29,880
Wait...

1336
02:02:30,360 --> 02:02:33,880
Raziya, who's responsible for
the recent murders in the city...

1337
02:02:33,920 --> 02:02:37,800
has killed Rawther
and his second son

1338
02:03:08,360 --> 02:03:09,760
- Hello
- Brother

1339
02:03:10,080 --> 02:03:11,640
Hussain

1340
02:03:11,680 --> 02:03:13,360
What has happened to Hussain?

1341
02:03:13,400 --> 02:03:14,600
He's dead

1342
02:03:15,360 --> 02:03:19,480
I've killed him in his
favourite spot he wished for

1343
02:05:01,240 --> 02:05:02,440
Not just that

1344
02:05:02,520 --> 02:05:06,120
she has also killed the drug
don of Tamil Nadu...

1345
02:05:06,200 --> 02:05:09,320
and his right hand Edison

1346
02:05:14,800 --> 02:05:16,200
Sir

1347
02:05:16,440 --> 02:05:19,160
Hussain was murdered
in Rawther's godown

1348
02:05:19,560 --> 02:05:22,680
A huge amount of
Heroin is found here

1349
02:05:22,760 --> 02:05:24,800
Forensic has not
been informed yet

1350
02:05:24,880 --> 02:05:29,440
Let's discuss about the disposal
of the drugs if you come here

1351
02:05:40,600 --> 02:05:42,240
Hi Rama Chandramurthy

1352
02:05:55,920 --> 02:05:57,160
Hold on

1353
02:05:57,200 --> 02:05:59,000
Sir, call for you

1354
02:06:01,840 --> 02:06:03,440
Yes, tell me

1355
02:06:03,480 --> 02:06:07,320
All three were killed as per our plan

1356
02:06:07,440 --> 02:06:09,040
We have diverted the media as well

1357
02:06:09,080 --> 02:06:11,200
This has happened
in Rawther's godown

1358
02:06:11,280 --> 02:06:15,480
Raziya started shooting DC Rama
Chandramurthy and his team

1359
02:06:18,040 --> 02:06:20,800
Sir, can you do me a favour?

1360
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:24,000
Hmmm

1361
02:06:24,520 --> 02:06:28,280
For once I want to see the
house where me and Ibrahim lived

1362
02:07:09,560 --> 02:07:10,720
Let's go

1363
02:07:44,840 --> 02:07:46,360
- Louis
- Sir

1364
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:50,880
She has suffered a lot

1365
02:07:50,960 --> 02:07:53,520
- Let her rest without pain
- Yes, sir

1366
02:08:02,040 --> 02:08:03,360
Hi dear

1367
02:08:03,640 --> 02:08:05,280
Two girls

1368
02:08:05,520 --> 02:08:07,160
And two boys

1369
02:08:07,440 --> 02:08:08,360
Enough

1370
02:08:12,920 --> 02:08:15,320
With her valor and wisdom...

1371
02:08:16,120 --> 02:08:17,960
She was a tigress
who ruled Delhi

1372
02:08:34,880 --> 02:08:39,360
Everyone wishes to lead a
happy and peaceful life

1373
02:08:39,640 --> 02:08:42,280
But we are not the only deciding factors

1374
02:08:42,320 --> 02:08:44,920
People surrounding us decide it as well

1375
02:08:45,960 --> 02:08:50,280
Even small decision taken
by others affect us

1376
02:08:50,440 --> 02:08:52,760
It will turn our life upside down

1377
02:08:54,400 --> 02:08:56,160
What was my mistake?

1378
02:08:56,400 --> 02:08:58,400
What if I had stayed as Jaya?

1379
02:08:58,960 --> 02:09:01,240
What if I had not met Ibrahim?

1380
02:09:02,080 --> 02:09:07,360
What if Ibrahim had not been
greedy and not join this gang?

1381
02:09:09,040 --> 02:09:10,960
Material lures you to make it desire...

1382
02:09:11,800 --> 02:09:14,360
Desire makes you to wish for it

1383
02:09:15,040 --> 02:09:17,080
If the desires is met with hurdles

1384
02:09:17,600 --> 02:09:20,240
Anger will burn you down

1385
02:09:26,720 --> 02:09:31,480
"The sky is scorching"

1386
02:09:34,560 --> 02:09:37,880
Also drugs worth of
billions has been ceased

1387
02:09:37,920 --> 02:09:41,600
Many places are under search
based on that information

1388
02:09:41,640 --> 02:09:45,760
I appreciate DC Rama
Chandramurthy and his team...

1389
02:09:45,840 --> 02:09:48,160
for successfully carrying
out this operation

1390
02:09:48,200 --> 02:09:51,360
- Thank you very much
- Sir...

1391
02:09:54,840 --> 02:09:56,920
This job for you is
from your sister Raziya

1392
02:09:57,320 --> 02:10:00,360
You should be bold and improve in
our police department

1393
02:10:00,400 --> 02:10:01,360
All the best

1394
02:10:01,400 --> 02:10:03,000
Thank you, sir
