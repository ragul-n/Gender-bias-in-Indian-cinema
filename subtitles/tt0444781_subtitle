2
00:04:38,344 --> 00:04:41,313
welcome friends!
I'm here to narrate to you...

3
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:45,814
...a fantastic story
whose essence is love.

4
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:49,814
Friends, let me tell
you such a story...

5
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:51,820
...in which the impossible
becomes possible...

6
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:56,985
...in which a King finds his lost
queen and an old man, his youth.

7
00:04:57,196 --> 00:05:01,997
There was a scientist
by the name Khurana...

8
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:06,836
...who was a little forgetful
and a bit crazy.

9
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:11,841
For 25 years he worKed on a formula
that restores youth to the old.

10
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:14,513
EureKa! Found it!

11
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:19,515
One drop of this will maKe
a person younger by 25 years.

12
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:22,517
Let us see a live demonstration...

13
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:25,350
how Khurana's formula has
done the unimaginable!

14
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:29,183
One drop of this will
KnocK 25 years off.

15
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:32,193
A ducK will become the
egg that it once was.

16
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:36,198
Khurana has only two confidants
who Knew his secret.

17
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:41,032
One, his secretary Kavita,
and the other, a talKing parrot.

18
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:47,038
The duty of the talKing parrot was...

19
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:54,379
...to remind the forgetful
Khurana his every worK.

20
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:57,886
But the secretary Kavita
proved to be a traitor.

21
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:00,218
Khurana wanted to gift his
formula to the Indian government.

22
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:05,056
But Kavita schemed to leaK
it to Khurana's twin, a mafia don.

23
00:06:05,264 --> 00:06:09,963
What? My son, Baljit!

24
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:14,899
Baljit, the don's eldest son,
is corrupt and utterly selfish.

25
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:17,167
Dad, this is the day that
I've been waiting for.

26
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,409
Now on we will deal not in
billions but in trillions.

27
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:24,572
Shut up! I shall not
give it to anyone...

28
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:27,651
...whatever be the amount offered.

29
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:31,419
Only I will use the
formula and become young.

30
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:32,750
What foolishness is this, dad?

31
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:34,391
I am not being foolish.

32
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:37,589
Good morning dad.

33
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:40,425
Now meet his second son.

34
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:44,262
He is Sunny, whose genes seem
to have got jumbled up.

35
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:48,270
Today my love and life
Tanya is going to perform.

36
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:51,204
That's why I am going early to college.

37
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:52,770
Wish me good lucK.

38
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:57,449
You fool, learn to speaK
your language properly.

39
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,447
Don always had a suspicion that Sunny...

40
00:06:59,652 --> 00:07:03,110
...is not his own son.
He carried a notion...

41
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:10,285
...that his second wife wanted
to confess on her deathbed...

42
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:11,963
...that Sunny happened
because of her affair...

43
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:16,625
...with her neighbour Subramaniam.

44
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:18,633
Baljit deceived his father.

45
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:21,136
And offered to sell the
formula to a Chinese gang.

46
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,967
The gang gave him an
advance of 50 crores...

47
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:25,440
...and told Baljit to give
them the formula in 3 days.

48
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:28,313
Now let us put the formula
and these plots aside...

49
00:07:28,514 --> 00:07:30,982
...and come to the love story.

50
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:36,144
He studies in the college
and worKs in a canteen too.

51
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:41,486
A simple-minded lad
by the name Karan...

52
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:46,154
...with no one to call his own.

53
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:49,334
Murugan, who too worKs
in the canteen, is his only Kin.

54
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:54,499
Give this burger,
these pastries and this sandwich...

55
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:56,004
...to that fat girl sitting outside.

56
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:57,836
That fat girl eats a lot.

57
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:01,176
But we earn our living
only because she does that.

58
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:07,008
Said it right,
your honesty is your undoing.

59
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,688
Who is the best guy
in the college? - Sunny.

60
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:12,858
And who is most beautiful girl?
- Tanya.

61
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,757
The South Indian problem
of a North Indian father!

62
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:22,193
Sunny, Tanya's show is about
to begin. Come fast.

63
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:25,537
SpeaK softly.

64
00:08:25,738 --> 00:08:28,298
Otherwise everyone will
turn up at her show.

65
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:29,541
Did you see that?

66
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:33,041
C'mon guys let's go for the show.

67
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:37,777
Not just Sunny but the entire
college is obsessed with Tanya.

68
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:43,553
Karan too loves her...
within himself...

69
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:47,893
Don't you want to
go to Tanya's show?

70
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:51,123
No

71
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:57,395
You liKe her a lot, don't you?

72
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:01,903
Yes. - Let's go.

73
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:08,236
How can I when she and
I don't Know each other?

74
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:11,576
I worK in this in small canteen.

75
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:15,751
But the entire college
is mad after her.

76
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:19,090
She doesn't even Know my name.

77
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:22,921
How can she...
till you get to Know each other.

78
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:25,427
C'mon now. - No, Murugan.

79
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:26,598
Let's go.

80
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:37,900
UTV

81
00:09:56,228 --> 00:10:05,296
"You fill my world"

82
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:14,310
"I can't taKe my eyes off
you or live alone without you"

83
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:18,978
"You are the throb of my heart"

84
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:35,833
"You rest in my eyelids"

85
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:40,665
"You are my obsession"

86
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,534
"Your lovely face fills my vision"

87
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:50,011
"You fill my world"

88
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:54,547
"Your name dances on my lips"

89
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:59,253
"It is your beauty
that my words depict"

90
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:04,288
"My thoughts are filled
with your remembrance..."

91
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:08,564
"...from my breath
exudes your fragrance"

92
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:15,241
KILLER JEANS singer of the year award
goes to Tanya Moolchandani.

93
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:17,971
C'mon people,
lets give her a big hand.

94
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:32,819
TaKe this.
- Give my goggles bacK!

95
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:43,724
Somebody please help me.
They've taKen my goggles.

96
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:51,569
Leave him... leave him...

97
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:53,972
what are you doing?

98
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:56,574
We are playing the goggle
game. Want to join?

99
00:11:57,616 --> 00:12:00,176
It is not good to
trouble someone liKe this.

100
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:03,585
Who are you? Are you the
brother of this mad guy?

101
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:04,915
Are you his brother?

102
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:06,587
Tell me, burger...
Is he your brother?

103
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:07,918
Is this mad guy your brother?

104
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:11,426
He is my brother.

105
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:17,599
Sister, he snatched my goggles.

106
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:23,431
He is being rough with me...
he is a rogue.

107
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:24,605
This one is a good guy.

108
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:29,270
Tanya, sorry. We didn't Know
that he is your brother.

109
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:30,608
Thousand apologies,

110
00:12:30,816 --> 00:12:32,943
Here, taKe these glares.

111
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:35,120
Shut up! Just get out of here!

112
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:37,881
But, Tanya...
- I said get out.

113
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:42,454
OKay, I'll see you later.
C'mon boys, she really loves me.

114
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:48,433
How did you come out of the house?

115
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:52,092
From the rear window.
Because I couldn't trace my cycle.

116
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:54,101
Golu, how many times
should I tell you...

117
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:55,432
...not to come alone out
of the house liKe this?

118
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:57,609
Sorry, sis. - It's oKay.

119
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,107
Say thanKs to Karan.

120
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:00,778
ThanKs, Karan.

121
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:06,811
Do you Know my name?

122
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:10,477
I also Know that you came
last in the first year exam.

123
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:16,316
Just Kidding! You are a scholar
and... along with the studies you

124
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:18,156
...worK in the canteen
for your expenses too.

125
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:23,662
This is how the friendship started.
Karan wanted it to bloom.

126
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:30,001
What better chance than
a private Birthday bash!

127
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:32,336
He invited her and
Tanya too obliged.

128
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:33,671
A green signal from her side!

129
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:41,081
He cooKed delicious food,
lit the candle and waited...

130
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:42,854
He bought new pants and shirts.

131
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:45,523
Tanya too did some birthday
shopping for Karan.

132
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:48,018
Their hearts were
just about to unite...

133
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:50,525
...when villains played spoilsport.

134
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:52,693
The scientist locKed
the formula in a closet...

135
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:56,095
...told its code to his parrot...
and forgot it!

136
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:03,034
Baljit came to his uncle
to cheat him off his formula.

137
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:06,700
But the scientist tricKed Baljit
and ran away with his parrot.

138
00:14:06,912 --> 00:14:09,881
Baljit then saw how things stood.
The formula in the locKer...

139
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:13,381
...and it's code with
the talKing parrot.

140
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:18,455
Baljit tooK his men and
went looKing for the scientist.

141
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:27,732
Open the door.

142
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:40,478
Who are you?
Get out of my vehicle.

143
00:14:41,947 --> 00:14:44,245
What were you doing in it?

144
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,929
The scientist then saw
what fell out of Tanya's purse.

145
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:59,597
She left something behind.

146
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:00,765
When he saw it up close...

147
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:04,026
...it was Tanya's credit
card with her name on it.

148
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:11,440
Tanya felt sorry a little later.

149
00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:15,276
A man is in trouble,
why shouldn't I go to help him.

150
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:18,109
Well, she turned her car
to go bacK to him...

151
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:23,277
...and was aghast to see
the scene ahead of her.

152
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:29,120
Baljit saw the girl...

153
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:32,297
...and realized that
a horrible thing happened.

154
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:35,862
The girl saw him committing the murder...

155
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:40,465
...and she must be caught
before she lets it out.

156
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:43,967
He saw the credit card in
the scientist's hand...

157
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:47,407
...and understood that the parrot
was with a certain Tanya.

158
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,808
Now I have to catch
two girls in one night.

159
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:56,886
One who has the parrot and another,
who saw the murder.

160
00:15:58,357 --> 00:15:59,984
We must find the parrot.
Go and search for it.

161
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:09,823
When Baljit saw Tanya's photo,
he felt relieved.

162
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:14,495
The two girls he wants are
in fact one and the same!

163
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:16,834
Tanya ran to a police station...

164
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:19,169
...but the enemy was already there.

165
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:22,575
Tanya secretly overheard
their conversation...

166
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:25,509
...and realized that she has to
flee from her home that very night.

167
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:33,181
Karan waited and waited no end...

168
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:40,855
...but Tanya did not turn up that night.

169
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:44,866
Karan went to Tanya's house
to inquire after her.

170
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:48,198
Karan, who was unaware of
the sinister plot of murder...

171
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:49,874
...went to Tanya's house
but couldn't meet her.

172
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:53,203
Tanya had already left with
her brother Golu in darK...

173
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:56,939
...leaving Karan's love
story high and dry.

174
00:16:57,416 --> 00:17:06,222
Later Karan searched
everywhere he could...

175
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:10,953
...but couldn't trace Tanya.
She just vanished in thin air!

176
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:15,059
In this way the lovers parted ways.

177
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:19,731
See for yourself if they will
ever come together again.

178
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:59,206
Hey, what happened?
Any succees with the locKer?

179
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:05,873
It is 3 years now...
but they are still clueless about its code.

180
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:09,653
The fruit is within reach
but I can't have it!

181
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:12,985
Hey, Baljit!

182
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:14,889
Why are you gaping liKe that?

183
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,062
Search for that parrot and bring it.

184
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:20,060
You have been searching for
the parrot for the last 3 years.

185
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:23,234
Get my Tanya for me and
I will give you a grandson.

186
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:24,459
Get lost, idiot!

187
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:30,337
Go and get it... or don't
show me your dirty face again.

188
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:48,024
You have come very late...
- OKay...

189
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,262
what is this!? A bill though
I didn't eat anything!?

190
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:54,758
Excuse me, here is your food...
that bill is mine.

191
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,094
'Experience the joy in giving a bill! '

192
00:18:57,302 --> 00:19:00,100
You are mixing up your sandwich...

193
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,933
...with your bill.
Are you out of your mind.

194
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,939
I'm sorry. I got carried away a bit.

195
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,772
A bit!? You have lost
yourself since three years.

196
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,107
You have ruined your
life thinKing about Tanya.

197
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:12,783
Such a young and handsome guy you are!

198
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:16,614
Tell me and I will get you
not one but ten girls.

199
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,049
But none liKe Tanya.

200
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:23,624
And none is as smitten
by love as you!

201
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:27,390
Now taKe this bill and give
it at the correct table.

202
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:37,638
Excuse me!

203
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:44,142
Sorry... I thinK you are from
City College, right? - Yes.

204
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,478
And you are Karan. - Yes.

205
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:50,822
He's at it again! He's been
doing it since 3 years.

206
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,820
Inquiring all those who come
here, about Tanya.

207
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:56,153
You are Tanya's friends,
aren't you? - Yes.

208
00:19:56,361 --> 00:20:00,161
Do you Know where Tanya
stays at present?

209
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,890
Yes. Tanya went to stay at
her aunt's place in Delhi.

210
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,830
So... Tanya is in Delhi.

211
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,506
No, she was in Delhi
two years ago.

212
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:11,335
But now she settled
with her aunt in Dubai.

213
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:12,673
In Dubai!

214
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:17,841
Do you Know her address in Dubai?

215
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,018
No, we don't. Sorry.

216
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,346
ThanKs.

217
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:25,246
We are going to Dubai.
- What!?

218
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:30,187
Let's leave all this.
Tanya is in Dubai. Let's go there.

219
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:35,363
Is Dubai in the next street
for us to go there in a jiffy?

220
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:38,696
Do you have a passport?
- No, but I have a ration card.

221
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:42,040
You get ration and not flight
ticKets with a ration card.

222
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:46,040
But one can get a passport
with the ration card... what now?

223
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:49,214
Do you Know that it taKes
15 odd days to get a passport?

224
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:52,880
Besides, Dubai is a huge city.
How will you find Tanya there?

225
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:55,716
Three years have passed.
Isn't it possible...

226
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:59,390
...that someone else
entered her life?

227
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:06,494
Come what may, even if it
means that I have to spend...

228
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:12,893
...all my earnings,
I want to meet Tanya just once.

229
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,399
OKay, by the time that
we get our passport and visa...

230
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:23,077
...I will get Tanya's Dubai address.

231
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,647
How will you do that?

232
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,914
I have a friend who
imports items from Dubai...

233
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:30,316
...and sells them here.
He has very good contacts there.

234
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:35,650
He can help us.
- Where can we find him?

235
00:21:40,699 --> 00:21:50,665
UTV

236
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:18,299
"Come and give me a sweet Kiss"

237
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:22,462
"TaKe me into your arms
in warm embrace"

238
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:26,804
"Come and give me a sweet Kiss"

239
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:34,714
"TaKe me into your arms
in warm embrace"

240
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:45,490
"Your beautiful eyes are pulling
the strings of my heart"

241
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:47,995
"How to respond,
I Know not"

242
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:53,994
"I fear that my heart may
run off in your quest"

243
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:56,003
"I wouldn't Know
what to do next"

244
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:59,837
"No one can stop me now...

245
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:04,675
...reaching you is my goal,
I vow"

246
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:10,753
"Life is once, fall in love and
live every moment to the full"

247
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:13,957
"I love life, I love you"

248
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:18,356
"I love to live..."

249
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:22,522
"...I am Adam, yearning for Eve"

250
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:28,366
"O dear, my heart fell
gradually in love with you"

251
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:30,871
"This is your charm,
I Know for true"

252
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:37,042
"I slowly started believing
your words, my love"

253
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:39,217
"And to your magic,
this I owe"

254
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:42,717
"No one can stop me now...

255
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:47,722
...reaching you is my goal,
I vow"

256
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:53,558
"Life is once, fall in love and
live every moment to the full"

257
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:56,730
"I love life, I love you"

258
00:23:56,935 --> 00:24:01,065
"Come and give me a sweet Kiss"

259
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:05,539
"TaKe me into your arms
in warm embrace"

260
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:07,735
"Embrace me..."

261
00:24:13,718 --> 00:24:15,913
"Embrace me..."

262
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:20,385
"Embrace me..."

263
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,438
"Your rosy cheeKs
are such a treat..."

264
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:39,508
"...seeing which
I'm swept off my feet"

265
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:45,447
"These lips of yours,
are cups filled with wine"

266
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,777
"I drinK from them and
reach cloud nine"

267
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:51,285
"No one can stop me now."

268
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:56,291

271
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:09,796
"I love to live..."

272
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:14,138
"...I am Adam, yearning for Eve"

273
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:19,807
"Your flair fills me
with enchanting music"

274
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:22,486
"My heart dances to its tunes"

275
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:28,482
"Your memories haunt me
all through lonely nights"

276
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:30,661
"My soul seeKs you
in dreamy flights"

277
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:34,161
"No one can stop me now...

280
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:48,437
"I love life, I love you"

281
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:52,672
"Come and give me a sweet Kiss"

282
00:25:52,884 --> 00:26:00,450
"TaKe me into your arms
in warm embrace"

283
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:11,794
"Embrace me..."

284
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:15,540
"Embrace me..."

285
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:20,874
"Embrace me..."

286
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:44,891
You dog! Why are you
trying to hide from me?

287
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:48,232
Nana, what brings you
here so suddenly?

288
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,907
What else? I want money.

289
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:53,908
If you don't return my money today,
I'll cut your throat.

290
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:55,909
Hey, man! - Who is that?

291
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:59,242
Let him go. He doesn't have
another throat to spare.

292
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:02,579
Leave him. Come here, brother.

293
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:05,255
Who are you and what
worK do you have here?

294
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:06,253
What can you do to me?

295
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,756
Not me... all of us will do it.

296
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,927
Well... who are your men?

297
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:13,757
Do you want to checK out?
Kaliya, come here.

298
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:27,771
Does that bring you down to earth?

299
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:35,885
I am not afraid of you.

300
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:39,624
I am indebted to him.
I am ready to taKe the blows.

301
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:45,126
Raise the staKes one to ten.
Hey, play the music he liKes!

302
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:50,563
Kutty, your man is a goner today...
I staKe double the money!

303
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:53,232
C'mon... into the ring!

304
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:44,013
One for you and one for me.

305
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:48,291
Two for you... and two for me.
- OKay.

306
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:52,689
Three for you... and three
for me. - OKay.

307
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:55,024
Fifty-fifty. Fair enough,
isn't it? - OKay.

308
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:57,201
Happy? - Very happy.

309
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:58,369
No cheating. - No.

310
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:01,038
If you feel cheated then taKe
this and calculate yourself.

311
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:02,706
No, you are great.

312
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:06,365
Brother Kutty! - Brother Murugan?

313
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:07,374
TaKe this...

314
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:12,542
welcome... - How are you?
Doing fine?

315
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:16,546
He is Karan.
The one I told you about...

316
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:20,054
...who wants to search
for his love in Dubai...

317
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:24,721
There is a man who is most
capable of doing that. - Who?

318
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:27,898
My name is RocKy.
You are Karan and he is Murugan.

319
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:30,567
You own a hotel but
go out and eat elsewhere.

320
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:33,795
He is younger and he,
elder... and are liKe brother and sister.

321
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:37,734
Brother and sister!?
- Want to Know anything more?

322
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:41,002
We want to Know about
Tanya and not about ourselves.

323
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,077
I can tell you not just
about Tanya but about her past...

324
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:47,081
...and future lives too.
Tell me what you want to Know.

325
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:51,088
We just want to Know about her present.

326
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:55,749
Is she a maid who stole
your money and ran away?

327
00:29:56,628 --> 00:30:00,257
No, she stole his
heart and went off.

328
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:01,932
Oh, I see! It is a matter
related to the heart.

329
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:04,761
It will be 15 to 20 days
before we get our passports.

330
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:07,938
We want you to go ahead of us
and gather information...

331
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:09,766
...by the time we reach there.
Any problem?

332
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:14,843
I'll taKe 25000. - 25000!? - OKay.

333
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:18,778
That's just the advance.
Another 25000 after the worK is done.

334
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:22,111
50000!? We want
to Know only about Tanya...

335
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,617
...and not about the whole of Dubai!

336
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:27,121
Murugan, I am ready to pay.

337
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:30,522
And pay 50000 after you meet Tanya.
That'll settle it.

338
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:33,289
Oh my gosh! 100000 in all!

339
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:36,797
For that money, Tanya will herself
come here and give her address.

340
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:38,798
OKay, call her and taKe her address.

341
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:41,471
We don't need your help.
Let's find someone else.

342
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:43,470
You wait.

343
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:46,643
OKay then. - No, this isn't
how things are done.

344
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,813
I will give you one laKh rupees.
- One laKh!?

345
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:53,879
Fine. How can I identify her?

346
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,827
What is this? Does she looK liKe this?

347
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:06,994
No, not liKe this. - Then what should
I do with it, should I feed it chillies?

348
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:08,665
Should I sing a song?

349
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:17,232
Give me her photo.
- Sorry, I don't have that.

350
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:20,442
But I have her name...
Tanya Mirchandani.

351
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:23,510
Give this to her.
She may recognize it.

352
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:27,014
Will she recognize
this parrot? - Yes.

353
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:29,778
What a strange
love affair yours is!

354
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:32,121
OKay, I'll do your worK.

355
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,021
Dubai...

356
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:58,382
welcome to Dubai.
- Any progress in your worK?

357
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:01,484
Lots! It goes on rent
for 8 hours everyday.

358
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:03,050
The girl goes on rent!?

359
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:05,222
Oh, not the girl...
I'm talKing about my rental car business.

360
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:06,549
It's doing pretty well.

361
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,225
I am asKing about Tanya.

362
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:11,884
She has changed her name...
she is Natasha now.

363
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:15,293
I found this from the Indian embassy.
Here is her address.

364
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:20,233
You are quite fast at worK
these days. Very good.

365
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:22,167
Come on, let us go.

366
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:32,576
This bungalow is wonderful!

367
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:33,910
That's the one we want.

368
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:40,250
It has one balcony,
two windows and one main gate.

369
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:43,427
A tree too, though I don't Know
it's name... but I'll maKe a note.

370
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:47,257
Are you a broKer?
We came here to investigate...

371
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:48,932
...and not to deal
in real estate here.

372
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:51,260
Leave this and taKe this.

373
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:53,930
It is good that you
brought this baton along.

374
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:55,765
People here Keep a lot of dogs,
don't Know why.

375
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:58,772
This is a miKe and not a baton.

376
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:00,433
Shall I say something into it?

377
00:33:00,945 --> 00:33:03,436
It's not for us to speaK
but to evesdrop on others.

378
00:33:04,248 --> 00:33:07,649
Go in there.
I will stand here and listen.

379
00:33:08,252 --> 00:33:09,184
Will you hear with this?!

380
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:12,788
I will see with this...
and hear with this.

381
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:15,922
Just go now! - OKay.

382
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:30,140
Natasha! - Here I come.

383
00:33:34,212 --> 00:33:36,578
Turn it the other way!

384
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:44,043
Turn the miKe... not yourself!

385
00:33:47,492 --> 00:33:49,551
Turn it the other way round.

386
00:34:03,307 --> 00:34:05,036
Isn't Natasha sexy?

387
00:34:05,777 --> 00:34:09,110
This Natasha is some joKe! - What!?

388
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:10,471
TaKe a looK.

389
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:15,717
You are right.
- She seems to be an old hand.

390
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:18,051
I thinK that this guy,
Karan, deals in old scrap.

391
00:34:18,456 --> 00:34:19,388
Natasha!

392
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:22,525
Why is she calling out
to herself? - Don't Know.

393
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:25,924
Natasha! - What is it,
Ms. Sweety?

394
00:34:31,502 --> 00:34:32,400
Why are you shouting?

395
00:34:32,603 --> 00:34:33,934
Natasha seems to be a man!

396
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:37,238
What all did she change
along with her name!?

397
00:34:38,476 --> 00:34:40,637
I am starting to doubt Karan.

398
00:34:40,845 --> 00:34:43,609
It is getting late for
the shooting. Where is Natasha?

399
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:47,478
Ms. Sweety,
Natasha is in her room.

400
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:54,617
I'm sorry for the delay.
Only five more minutes.

401
00:34:54,826 --> 00:35:02,164
Is she Natasha?
- Yes... I am dead sure.

402
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:12,298
Today is a great day for me.

403
00:35:13,911 --> 00:35:15,708
Today is the shooting
of my video album.

404
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:21,574
Had you been with me,
my joy would have been even greater.

405
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:27,114
I miss you.
- We miss him too.

406
00:35:27,758 --> 00:35:30,352
Why are you crying?

407
00:35:31,662 --> 00:35:33,960
Why do you thinK that you are alone?

408
00:35:34,165 --> 00:35:36,065
I am always with you.

409
00:35:37,201 --> 00:35:42,867
Jayantilal and Tommy too
are with you. Isn't it?

410
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,981
C'mon fast. Or we will be
late for the shooting.

411
00:35:52,183 --> 00:35:55,016
Start the car.

412
00:35:57,755 --> 00:35:59,780
Forgive me brother,
I can't see.

413
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:01,982
I'm sorry. - It was my mistaKe.
Please forgive me.

414
00:36:02,193 --> 00:36:06,391
It's oKay. Let me drop you.

415
00:36:06,597 --> 00:36:11,193
Please forgive me.
I can't see at all.

416
00:36:11,402 --> 00:36:12,232
Otherwise I'd not
have bumped into you.

417
00:36:12,436 --> 00:36:14,461
Let's go fast.
- But brother, taKe this out.

418
00:36:46,137 --> 00:36:47,502
Cut, cut, cut.

419
00:36:49,607 --> 00:36:51,199
What are you doing here?

420
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:53,775
I'll go wherever Natasha goes.
I'll also dance.

421
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:58,542
Don't disturb the shooting. Later on,
you can dance as much as you want.

422
00:36:58,749 --> 00:37:01,547
Let's go and sit there.
Let's go.

423
00:37:01,752 --> 00:37:02,878
I'll be there in a moment.

424
00:37:05,089 --> 00:37:06,215
Shut up!

425
00:37:06,791 --> 00:37:09,123
Sorry, director.
The fact is that he was run over...

426
00:37:09,327 --> 00:37:12,125
...by Natasha's car
and has become disabled.

427
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:13,888
He even lost his memory and
is living with us since then.

428
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,565
Boss, he's disabled.

429
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:23,070
He's just liKe her brother
who passed away. - What!?

430
00:37:23,274 --> 00:37:25,208
It's none of our business.
He may be her distant relative.

431
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:26,967
Trying to eavesdrop?

432
00:37:34,118 --> 00:37:35,050
Sanju!

433
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:42,648
Wow... Natasha,
you looK gorgeous.

434
00:37:43,127 --> 00:37:46,153
Today is the first video
album of your career.

435
00:37:47,064 --> 00:37:50,659
All the very best.
- ThanK you, Sanju.

436
00:37:54,138 --> 00:37:57,505
Natasha, I want to tell you
something very important.

437
00:37:57,875 --> 00:38:00,207
What's the matter?
- Let's go over there.

438
00:38:07,418 --> 00:38:09,147
Why is she always surrounded
by invalids? - Now, who's this?

439
00:38:09,887 --> 00:38:13,414
I don't Know. I've to find out.
Hold the miKe properly.

440
00:38:15,826 --> 00:38:18,624
Why do you looK so worried?

441
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:22,888
Natasha, it is about
that friend of yours.

442
00:38:24,201 --> 00:38:26,192
I learnt everything about him.

443
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:31,268
He's not only a drunKard,
but also a drug addict.

444
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:36,139
What? - Yes, he not only consumes
but also peddles drugs.

445
00:38:37,748 --> 00:38:38,510
Oh, no.

446
00:38:40,584 --> 00:38:43,382
Why can't I hear anything?
- Shall I go close to them?

447
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:47,052
Why don't you rather
give them the miKe!?

448
00:38:47,758 --> 00:38:50,488
Just stay put.
- So... shouldn't I go?

449
00:38:51,595 --> 00:38:56,396
Natasha, you must Keep away
from him... for my saKe.

450
00:38:57,601 --> 00:39:00,331
Sanju, I can't believe it.

451
00:39:00,538 --> 00:39:02,472
Even I couldn't
believe it initially.

452
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:03,296
Raj... how did all this happen?

453
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:09,742
TaKe this. Read this paper.
There's the police report in it.

454
00:39:16,387 --> 00:39:21,984
O my God! ThanK you very much, Sanju.

455
00:39:22,793 --> 00:39:25,057
I wouldn't have Known it,
but for you.

456
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,095
Madam, there's a call for you.

457
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:32,730
Cut, cut, cut it.

458
00:39:35,005 --> 00:39:41,433
Hello Raj, I don't want
to talK to you again.

459
00:39:41,645 --> 00:39:43,203
And I don't want to have
anything to do with you.

460
00:39:43,948 --> 00:39:47,509
And from now onwards,
if you try to meet me...

461
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:49,310
Or if you try to call me...

462
00:39:49,587 --> 00:39:51,521
...l'll complain against
you to the police.

463
00:39:56,293 --> 00:39:58,227
Be strong! I'm with you.

464
00:39:58,429 --> 00:40:01,660
Madam, the shot is ready.
Please come.

465
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:05,960
Go now. Your shot is ready.
I'll wait for you.

466
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:08,467
And Natasha, be strong. OKay?

467
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:14,635
Great! So... you wore
a new Kurta today.

468
00:40:15,513 --> 00:40:16,844
This is not a Kurta.
It's a coat.

469
00:40:17,047 --> 00:40:20,016
This is called a coat.

470
00:40:20,384 --> 00:40:21,180
Buddy, these are pants.

471
00:40:21,385 --> 00:40:23,819
These that you have on your
hand are pants. Very nice!

472
00:40:24,021 --> 00:40:27,684
This is a tie. - This is not a tie,
it's a handKerchief.

473
00:40:28,025 --> 00:40:31,688
What a weird man you are!
This... is a handKerchief.

474
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:35,588
But this is a vest.
- A vest is worn inside a shirt!

475
00:40:35,966 --> 00:40:37,900
What one wears inside a
shirt are called socKs.

476
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:41,435
SocKs are worn inside shoes!

477
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:45,075
What we wear inside
shoes is called 'underwear'.

478
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:47,836
Underwear! LooK here...
this is what is called underwear.

479
00:40:50,981 --> 00:40:52,346
What are you staring at?

480
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:54,675
It seems that your Knee
isn't worKing well.

481
00:40:54,885 --> 00:40:57,683
Go and get it treated by a plumber.

482
00:40:58,489 --> 00:41:00,684
By a plumber? - Careful...
or this blouse will get broKen!

483
00:41:00,891 --> 00:41:02,586
Silence... silence please.

484
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:10,131
Move bacK! - Your Kurta looKs great!

485
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:20,035
I have to get some more
details about this girl.

486
00:41:20,244 --> 00:41:25,341
No boss, we should get
more details about her.

487
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:30,112
What happened?
- Nothing.

488
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:36,324
Sometimes, I feel that
it is my mistaKe.

489
00:41:36,527 --> 00:41:39,325
It's my fault.
Had I forced you...

490
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:41,498
...you'd have been
married by now.

491
00:41:43,033 --> 00:41:45,001
Aunty, what's the point
in forcing someone?

492
00:41:45,302 --> 00:41:46,633
Shouldn't one find
a worthy man for that?

493
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:50,568
You saw many guys.
What sort of guy do you want?

494
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:56,943
Good looKs and riches...
these don't matter.

495
00:41:58,315 --> 00:42:01,478
But he should have a loving heart...

496
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:04,915
...and must do something creative.

497
00:42:05,122 --> 00:42:11,322
LiKe... an architect.
And he should respect women too.

498
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:15,056
Even after all these years
aunty couldn't find a good guy.

499
00:42:15,266 --> 00:42:17,291
But I am sure that you will
find such a man very soon.

500
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:22,137
What happened to your voice?
- What happened?

501
00:42:22,339 --> 00:42:23,670
Why did you laugh liKe a man?

502
00:42:26,343 --> 00:42:31,110
Aunty, I'm sure that some day
I'll get my dream boy.

503
00:42:33,017 --> 00:42:35,747
Now, we're in Tanya's city.
Aren't you happy?

504
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:38,320
Are you happy? No?

505
00:42:38,522 --> 00:42:42,618
No, Murugan. Till I see Tanya
with my very own eyes...

506
00:42:43,527 --> 00:42:44,323
...I can't be happy.

507
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:46,928
No problem. Give me one hour.

508
00:42:47,131 --> 00:42:49,861
We'll go to RocKy and taKe
Tanya's address from him...

509
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:51,056
...and from there we shall go to
Tanya's house.

510
00:42:51,268 --> 00:42:54,499
Then you can see her and talK to her.
As much as you wish. Happy?

511
00:42:54,705 --> 00:42:55,729
What's the problem?

512
00:43:00,978 --> 00:43:02,775
How are you?

513
00:43:04,014 --> 00:43:06,073
Come... come. Welcome to Dubai

514
00:43:06,483 --> 00:43:08,610
please have a seat.
Sit down. - OK.

515
00:43:12,723 --> 00:43:16,352
Congratulations. He was right.

516
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:18,821
He was right.
His heart was always right.

517
00:43:22,066 --> 00:43:23,294
She is in Dubai.

518
00:43:29,873 --> 00:43:30,737
How is she?

519
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:34,075
Beautiful. Her face is very beautiful.

520
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:35,802
Good. Very good...

521
00:43:39,149 --> 00:43:43,142
But... - But?

522
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:47,852
She's expanded in all directions.

523
00:43:49,693 --> 00:43:51,217
Expanded...!? Is she some Kind
of a blanKet or what?

524
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:53,293
She has become 132 Km!

525
00:43:54,565 --> 00:43:55,998
132 Km?

526
00:43:56,867 --> 00:44:00,234
I mean, she now weighs 132 Kg...
she just sits all the time.

527
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:05,101
Sits all the time!? Can't she walK?

528
00:44:06,377 --> 00:44:08,641
How can a person walK on a wheelchair?
- On a wheelchair?

529
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:11,338
Isn't there any other chair in her house?
Why a wheelchair?

530
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:15,050
An accident is bound to happen
when one drinKs and drives.

531
00:44:17,221 --> 00:44:22,557
Accident!? And did Tanya start boozing?

532
00:44:23,761 --> 00:44:26,787
She normally never touched liquor.

533
00:44:27,431 --> 00:44:32,459
But when angry, she would
gulp down a full bottle.

534
00:44:34,638 --> 00:44:40,235
And that day she had a fight
with her husband.

535
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:48,018
Husband!? You mean...
Tanya got married?

536
00:44:49,386 --> 00:44:52,913
Did I ever say that she is married?
Did I?

537
00:44:54,324 --> 00:44:55,723
Actually, she is a widow.

538
00:44:58,595 --> 00:44:59,994
In fact, she is a double widow.

539
00:45:05,602 --> 00:45:10,232
Her first husband was very good.
His only vice was smoKing.

540
00:45:12,009 --> 00:45:15,035
One day he was smoKing a cigarette
and it blew up.

541
00:45:15,946 --> 00:45:16,810
Blew up!?

542
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:20,915
He was at a petrol pump
and it blew up.

543
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:25,120
And the second husband?
- He was liKe God.

544
00:45:26,623 --> 00:45:32,323
He had no bad habits.
But he was forgetful.

545
00:45:33,864 --> 00:45:35,593
One day, he got up from bed
and tooK his bath.

546
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:39,266
For his breaKfast he had
bread, jam, butter, cheese...

547
00:45:40,704 --> 00:45:43,138
But he forgot the most important thing.

548
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:45,274
Bread? - No, his breath.

549
00:45:46,777 --> 00:45:50,440
He forgot to breathe.

550
00:45:50,781 --> 00:45:54,342
Because he had acute
breathing problem.

551
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:06,552
Both the husbands passed away...

552
00:46:07,698 --> 00:46:11,464
...but I've seen how much
she loves her Kids.

553
00:46:11,668 --> 00:46:13,465
Kids!? She has Kids too?

554
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:15,831
She has 6 healthy Kids.

555
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:16,971
Six Kids?

556
00:46:18,075 --> 00:46:19,975
How can she have six Kids in three years?

557
00:46:21,411 --> 00:46:23,811
Twins! A pair of twins each year.

558
00:46:24,915 --> 00:46:25,711
You are right.

559
00:46:25,916 --> 00:46:29,147
To raise them,
she worKs very hard at night.

560
00:46:30,187 --> 00:46:30,983
WorKs at night?

561
00:46:31,188 --> 00:46:33,656
Yes, she started a laundry
at her home.

562
00:46:35,259 --> 00:46:36,590
She set up 4-5 machines.

563
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:38,989
She goes about on her wheelchair
and washes all the clothes.

564
00:46:39,196 --> 00:46:42,393
Then she irons them. Don't asK
what all things that Mother India doesn't do.

565
00:46:44,868 --> 00:46:46,995
She worKs hard for her seven Kids.

566
00:46:47,204 --> 00:46:49,934
Seven? Just now, you said six Kids.

567
00:47:00,217 --> 00:47:01,582
The sixth child is illegal.

568
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:02,843
Illegal?

569
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:06,145
It's from an underworld don's.

570
00:47:07,391 --> 00:47:09,359
She married him too? - No. She didn't!

571
00:47:11,395 --> 00:47:13,886
One day she burnt his suit.

572
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:19,363
The don forgave her.
And then the affair started.

573
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:25,206
Now both of you decide and tell me.

574
00:47:28,312 --> 00:47:32,544
When should I booK the ticKets to India?

575
00:47:59,843 --> 00:48:03,836
Let bygones be bygones.

576
00:48:04,781 --> 00:48:09,275
Get him married to a nice girl in India.

577
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:10,951
Find a good bride for him.

578
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:13,022
Where's your luggage?
Aren't you coming to India?

579
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:16,852
Who will maKe the payment?
Defaulters are Killed here.

580
00:48:17,294 --> 00:48:20,161
But, I'm not worried about the
payment you owe me.

581
00:48:20,364 --> 00:48:21,592
Your payment... - No.

582
00:48:21,798 --> 00:48:22,594
Your payment... - No.

583
00:48:22,799 --> 00:48:23,595
TaKe your payment.

584
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:26,860
Are you mad? I can't taKe
money from a true lover.

585
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:29,561
Hey God! I shall never commit such a sin.

586
00:48:29,806 --> 00:48:31,296
OKay, put it in here.

587
00:48:35,312 --> 00:48:36,540
C'mon. Why have you landed here?

588
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:39,875
If we don't get a seat in the plane,
we'll have to travel standing.

589
00:48:42,653 --> 00:48:45,144
No... I'll not go bacK.

590
00:48:45,956 --> 00:48:48,424
What!? You'll not go to India?

591
00:48:48,625 --> 00:48:51,992
However Tanya is in trouble right now.

592
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:55,094
She needs me more than ever.

593
00:48:56,333 --> 00:48:58,028
And I can't leave her alone in this condition.

594
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:03,103
I'll not go bacK.

595
00:49:04,708 --> 00:49:07,734
I bow to the greatness of your love.

596
00:49:08,211 --> 00:49:14,810
Stay bacK. And I promise...

597
00:49:15,485 --> 00:49:19,922
...when you meet Tanya after 3 years,
I'll cry a lot.

598
00:49:20,524 --> 00:49:21,991
After three years!?

599
00:49:22,526 --> 00:49:24,153
She went on her honeymoon last night.

600
00:49:24,361 --> 00:49:25,589
She went to honeymoon alone?

601
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:27,721
Not alone. She went with that underwear.

602
00:49:27,931 --> 00:49:28,829
Underwear?

603
00:49:29,032 --> 00:49:31,796
Sorry, I mean the underworld don.

604
00:49:32,002 --> 00:49:32,832
She went away with him for three years.

605
00:49:33,036 --> 00:49:35,163
Such a long honeymoon! Three years!

606
00:49:36,206 --> 00:49:39,039
When the Interpol chases
an underworld don...

607
00:49:39,242 --> 00:49:41,540
...he needs to be on the run
for at least three years.

608
00:49:41,745 --> 00:49:44,179
Three years! I won't stay here
for three years.

609
00:49:44,381 --> 00:49:47,839
The three years will pass easily
in five years.

610
00:49:48,051 --> 00:49:50,747
What is all this nonsense?

611
00:49:50,954 --> 00:49:52,546
Don't confuse us. We're not mad.

612
00:49:52,756 --> 00:49:55,224
Do we have oil wells here to
stay on for three years?

613
00:49:55,425 --> 00:49:57,689
Who'll manage our business there?
Karan, let's go.

614
00:49:57,894 --> 00:49:58,360
Stop there!

615
00:49:58,562 --> 00:49:59,028
Let go!

616
00:49:59,229 --> 00:50:05,190
Hold on. Go away!
Go away if you have to.

617
00:50:07,571 --> 00:50:08,970
Good riddance!

618
00:50:12,909 --> 00:50:14,843
Can I checK your passport?

619
00:50:18,915 --> 00:50:21,076
How many pieces do you have?
- Two.

620
00:50:36,233 --> 00:50:37,723
Your passport. - ThanK you.

621
00:50:40,604 --> 00:50:42,469
Karan, Karan.

622
00:51:08,131 --> 00:51:11,066
What's it?
Karan, will you go to India running?

623
00:51:11,268 --> 00:51:12,963
The new van that came just now...
- Yes.

624
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:14,432
There's Tanya's poster on that van.

625
00:51:15,539 --> 00:51:16,164
What?

626
00:51:16,373 --> 00:51:18,068
Tanya is in Dubai. - What?

627
00:51:18,275 --> 00:51:19,606
I found her, Murugan.

628
00:51:21,211 --> 00:51:23,338
That means RocKy tooK
our money and cheated us!

629
00:51:23,547 --> 00:51:25,378
No. I saw that poster and...

630
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:26,708
...the name was Natasha instead of Tanya.

631
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:28,384
That means Tanya changed her name.

632
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:29,882
And we've asKed RocKy
to search for Tanya.

633
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:32,885
That means whatever he said
was about some other Tanya.

634
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:35,650
OKay, but the van is gone.
Where will we looK for Tanya?

635
00:51:35,859 --> 00:51:37,121
I saw the music company's name.

636
00:51:37,327 --> 00:51:39,158
We'll get the address.
That won't be difficult.

637
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:43,221
No difficulty! No difficulty!

638
00:51:43,633 --> 00:51:44,099
Where's the luggage?

639
00:51:44,301 --> 00:51:47,737
The luggage has been put
on the flight to India.

640
00:52:06,823 --> 00:52:10,259
Why don't you do
some shopping with us too?

641
00:52:10,494 --> 00:52:11,688
What is this nuisance?

642
00:52:18,735 --> 00:52:20,259
I'll call the police.

643
00:52:21,238 --> 00:52:23,035
Leave me...

644
00:52:23,874 --> 00:52:24,340
Hello buddy! - Who is that?

645
00:52:28,278 --> 00:52:29,210
How far is the nearby hospital?

646
00:52:29,412 --> 00:52:31,573
Do you want to get admitted?

647
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:33,749
No, I'm thinKing of admitting you people.

648
00:52:34,117 --> 00:52:38,383
Excuse me, madam.
Please hold this. ThanK you.

649
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:42,858
Come on boy...

650
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:45,491
If it is far off, I will taKe you there
and breaK your bones.

651
00:52:46,863 --> 00:52:49,593
Or do you want me to do it here?
What do you say?

652
00:54:05,875 --> 00:54:07,069
How was it?

653
00:54:07,277 --> 00:54:15,651
TaKe this. This is your 100.
Yours... and yours. You taKe 50.

654
00:54:15,852 --> 00:54:17,444
Why only 50? What was my mistaKe?

655
00:54:17,654 --> 00:54:18,985
They worKed so hard.

656
00:54:19,189 --> 00:54:22,886
He broKe the bonnet and he, the glass.
He broKe a bottle on his head.

657
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:25,653
You didn't breaK even a mud pot.
You are not fit for this.

658
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:28,860
Sorry boss. I missed out this time.

659
00:54:31,501 --> 00:54:35,938
Teach him or I will have to bash you all up.

660
00:54:41,878 --> 00:54:44,540
You got hurt?

661
00:54:46,583 --> 00:54:49,882
Just a minor scratch, but its oK.

662
00:54:50,587 --> 00:54:52,111
But are you oKay?

663
00:54:52,489 --> 00:54:54,116
Yeah, I'm absolutely oK.

664
00:54:57,661 --> 00:54:59,390
Are you an architect?

665
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:02,560
How did you Know that?

666
00:55:03,266 --> 00:55:04,961
I saw it...

667
00:55:06,236 --> 00:55:10,002
You must have seen me in
Time magazine's cover story, last year.

668
00:55:10,273 --> 00:55:13,003
No, it is written on your bag.

669
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:15,835
Sharp mind! - ThanK you.

670
00:55:17,347 --> 00:55:19,110
By the way, I'm RocKy Hiranandani.

671
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:20,613
Natasha Mirchandani.

672
00:55:21,184 --> 00:55:24,312
It is I who designed this global village.

673
00:55:24,954 --> 00:55:27,184
Really? Wow!

674
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:29,119
I'm a gold medalist from Oxford Dictionary.

675
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:30,384
Excuse me!

676
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:33,786
Oxford university. What did you hear?

677
00:55:34,130 --> 00:55:35,791
I'm sorry, I heard dictionary.

678
00:55:37,767 --> 00:55:38,859
I'm really sorry.

679
00:55:39,469 --> 00:55:43,496
I earned a lot of money and
now want to do something else.

680
00:55:44,207 --> 00:55:51,670
I want to help the disabled,
mentally retarded and the blind.

681
00:55:51,881 --> 00:55:55,977
Have you seen the movie 'BlacK'?
- Yeah, it was very touching.

682
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:58,882
Great! I financed it.

683
00:55:59,089 --> 00:55:59,680
Really?

684
00:55:59,889 --> 00:56:02,357
I gave all my white money in blacK.

685
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:03,025
Oh!

686
00:56:03,226 --> 00:56:05,854
Come. I will drop you. What happened?

687
00:56:06,062 --> 00:56:08,360
Wow, Ferrari!

688
00:56:10,667 --> 00:56:12,828
Yes, this is my car, Ferrari. Please come.

689
00:56:13,737 --> 00:56:14,533
Lovely car.

690
00:56:14,738 --> 00:56:16,797
Isn't it lovely! Please, come.

691
00:56:17,006 --> 00:56:19,975
No thanKs. I've my car. I'll go on it.

692
00:56:20,176 --> 00:56:24,135
By the way, I stay nearby.
If you're free, let's have some coffee.

693
00:56:24,347 --> 00:56:26,042
Let's go.

694
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:27,648
No. Not now.

695
00:56:27,851 --> 00:56:32,117
No, I meant 6 pm. How can we go now?
This is my worK hour.

696
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:38,484
Someone is driving away your car...

697
00:56:38,695 --> 00:56:41,323
Driver, come soon after having lunch.

698
00:56:43,366 --> 00:56:45,732
A driver? I will go in a boat

699
00:56:45,935 --> 00:56:46,993
what is your address?

700
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:48,962
Bungalow no. 13, Jumera Beach.

701
00:56:49,172 --> 00:56:50,230
OKay, I'll see you there.

702
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:56,310
Nice to meet you. - Bye, bye!

703
00:57:09,325 --> 00:57:10,121
Got it?

704
00:57:11,027 --> 00:57:12,892
We are finished! It's Thursday today.

705
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:14,654
What if it is Thursday?

706
00:57:15,131 --> 00:57:15,927
This is Dubai, man.

707
00:57:16,132 --> 00:57:17,156
It is a holiday on Thursday and Friday.

708
00:57:17,367 --> 00:57:19,699
We will Know about Tanya
when the shop opens on Saturday.

709
00:57:19,903 --> 00:57:23,430
We are in trouble.

710
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:28,009
Murugan, this time I will trace
Tanya at any cost.

711
00:57:28,378 --> 00:57:29,345
In these clothes?

712
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:32,309
After two days you won't be able to
recognize me.

713
00:57:32,515 --> 00:57:33,846
How can Tanya recognize you?

714
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:36,482
Right buddy! Our luggage
has gone to India.

715
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:38,720
Let's do one thing. First of all,
let's buy some clothes.

716
00:57:38,922 --> 00:57:40,514
Let's go. - C'mon.

717
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:52,423
These days there is no safety
even in the parKing lot.

718
00:57:53,069 --> 00:57:56,869
Aunty, I wonder what would have happened,
if that guy hadn't come at the right time.

719
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:59,335
Right, and by the way, how does he looK?

720
00:58:00,510 --> 00:58:02,444
Good looKing... handsome.

721
00:58:02,645 --> 00:58:05,671
Handsome! He must be using
'Fair and Lovely'.

722
00:58:05,982 --> 00:58:09,383
Shall I tell you one more thing?
He is a famous architect.

723
00:58:09,586 --> 00:58:12,680
Architect? Whom are you talKing about?

724
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:15,719
They are talKing about you!

725
00:58:16,292 --> 00:58:17,122
Am I an architect?

726
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:18,817
You fool! It is about me.

727
00:58:19,295 --> 00:58:22,856
Even Raj pretended to be an architect,
but he was a drug addict

728
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:24,530
Aunty, please...

729
00:58:24,734 --> 00:58:25,632
what 'please'?

730
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:29,362
She said something sensible
for the first time.

731
00:58:29,706 --> 00:58:31,970
Aunty... we shouldn't
trust loafers liKe him.

732
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:33,806
He isn't a loafer.

733
00:58:34,711 --> 00:58:35,507
Really!

734
00:58:35,945 --> 00:58:38,505
I have asKed him to come here for coffee.

735
00:58:39,115 --> 00:58:39,911
Here!?

736
00:58:40,283 --> 00:58:44,083
It's alright. We'll get a
chance to examine him.

737
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:47,251
Jayantilal Knows who is good and who isn't.

738
00:58:47,857 --> 00:58:51,224
If Jayantilal approves him, so have I.

739
00:58:52,562 --> 00:58:54,086
You understood the situation? - Yes.

740
00:58:55,532 --> 00:59:00,094
No, you didn't. Now,
we have to propitiate aunty.

741
00:59:00,303 --> 00:59:04,205
Aunty! Have you changed the target?
How many people will you woo.

742
00:59:05,742 --> 00:59:10,839
To woo Natasha, we have to
tacKle her aunty first.

743
00:59:11,247 --> 00:59:16,184
And to do that, we have to
persuade Jayantilal.

744
00:59:38,041 --> 00:59:40,100
Happy birthday to you!

745
00:59:41,177 --> 00:59:42,109
Whose birthday?

746
00:59:42,345 --> 00:59:43,471
Your birthday.

747
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:45,545
My birthday! It is not my birthday.

748
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:47,147
Weren't you born?

749
00:59:47,350 --> 00:59:49,443
How did you Know that I was born?

750
00:59:49,652 --> 00:59:50,676
Because I too was born.

751
00:59:50,887 --> 00:59:51,410
And you were also born.

752
00:59:51,621 --> 00:59:53,145
That means we are brothers by birth.

753
00:59:53,356 --> 00:59:54,983
TaKe this. I brought flowers for you.

754
00:59:55,191 --> 00:59:58,251
OKay, put them on that tree
and leave this place.

755
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:05,534
I will give you gifts daily,
after you become my brother-in-law.

756
01:00:05,868 --> 01:00:08,336
But I don't have a sister.

757
01:00:08,538 --> 01:00:11,530
You have two sisters inside.
And you are lying to me, Jayantilal.

758
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:12,934
Where is Jayantilal?

759
01:00:13,142 --> 01:00:14,666
So you forgot your name also?

760
01:00:15,178 --> 01:00:16,770
What is your name? - RocKy.

761
01:00:17,113 --> 01:00:22,312
Is it oKay with you if I call you
MonKey, hocKey or TanKy?

762
01:00:22,852 --> 01:00:23,841
Jayantilal!

763
01:00:24,721 --> 01:00:28,680
Jayantilal! Is my tongue wagging?
- No.

764
01:00:29,325 --> 01:00:31,088
Do I have a tail? - No.

765
01:00:31,327 --> 01:00:33,158
Did I ever barK at you? - No.

766
01:00:33,363 --> 01:00:36,196
Did you ever see me wetting the posts?

767
01:00:36,566 --> 01:00:38,397
Hold on! Not till now.

768
01:00:38,601 --> 01:00:40,364
Then, how can I be Jayantilal?

769
01:00:40,570 --> 01:00:42,162
Because your name is Jayantilal.

770
01:00:43,039 --> 01:00:45,940
So you really have the itch
to meet Jayantilal.

771
01:00:46,142 --> 01:00:49,168
I will call him, right now.
It will give you a awful bite... Jayantilal.

772
01:00:49,846 --> 01:00:50,744
Whom are you calling?

773
01:00:50,947 --> 01:00:52,972
My dog.

774
01:00:53,516 --> 01:00:54,414
What is your name?

775
01:00:54,617 --> 01:00:57,381
Tommy.

776
01:00:57,754 --> 01:00:58,812
Oh my God!

777
01:01:35,391 --> 01:01:38,519
Who are you and what do you want?
Why do you come here always?

778
01:01:38,728 --> 01:01:39,922
Why do you meet me always?

779
01:01:40,129 --> 01:01:42,290
Because this house is mine.
Now, leave this place.

780
01:01:42,498 --> 01:01:45,262
I am the future owner of this house.
Now, you leave this place.

781
01:01:45,468 --> 01:01:47,993
I am the owner. Go away.

782
01:01:48,204 --> 01:01:51,833
Your sister Natasha invited me.
You should go away.

783
01:01:52,408 --> 01:01:53,568
She might have called you
to maKe you her brother.

784
01:01:53,776 --> 01:01:56,336
She maKes every other man her brother.

785
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:58,878
I am the main one and
you are the 'other'. Get lost.

786
01:01:59,082 --> 01:02:01,050
Go away from here.
TaKe a u-turn.

787
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:03,514
I will maKe your hand taKe the u-turn.

788
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:04,448
Tommy!

789
01:02:06,656 --> 01:02:07,953
What are you doing?

790
01:02:08,324 --> 01:02:09,450
How much will you beat me?

791
01:02:09,659 --> 01:02:11,183
No. No! - Stop it.

792
01:02:14,263 --> 01:02:17,596
Hi, RocKy. - Hi!

793
01:02:18,835 --> 01:02:21,599

Since my childhood, I Knew how to
Keep animals under control.

795
01:02:28,945 --> 01:02:31,778
And the people, bacK where I lived,

796
01:02:31,981 --> 01:02:32,777
TicKet ChecKer?

797
01:02:32,982 --> 01:02:35,473
No, no. Trainer and Controller.

798
01:02:35,685 --> 01:02:37,243
Wow, that's great.

799
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:40,245
By the way, she is Sweety, my aunty.

800
01:02:40,490 --> 01:02:45,359
What? Is she your aunty?
I thought she is your sister?

801
01:02:46,229 --> 01:02:46,820
ThanK you.

802
01:02:47,029 --> 01:02:48,792
You have maintained
your physique very well.

803
01:02:48,998 --> 01:02:51,694
ThanK you. By the way, are you married?

804
01:02:54,470 --> 01:02:55,960
No. I am a bachelor.

805
01:02:56,773 --> 01:03:01,073
Till now, I didn't find my Kind of girl.

806
01:03:01,277 --> 01:03:04,246
Even she isn't married...
Go and get him.

807
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:08,042
Tommy, today we have to attend a program.
Go and get ready.

808
01:03:09,051 --> 01:03:11,246
He taKes time to get ready.

809
01:03:11,487 --> 01:03:13,318
If you are going somewhere,
I shall taKe your leave.

810
01:03:13,723 --> 01:03:15,190
No, not now. In the evening.

811
01:03:15,391 --> 01:03:17,518
Today, we are launching Natasha.

812
01:03:18,094 --> 01:03:20,187
You are launching her?
Where is she going?

813
01:03:20,396 --> 01:03:23,194
No, I mean we are going to
Natasha's music launch party.

814
01:03:23,399 --> 01:03:24,730
You too come with us.

815
01:03:25,601 --> 01:03:29,503
What? Music! Are you a singer?

816
01:03:29,705 --> 01:03:31,730
Yes. - I love singers.

01:03:33,009 --> 01:03:36,775
I mean, I love music. You Know,

818
01:03:37,513 --> 01:03:38,070
Please, taKe this.

819
01:03:38,915 --> 01:03:40,143
What is the need for this?

820
01:03:40,349 --> 01:03:42,647
This isn't a gift. This is yours.

821
01:03:42,852 --> 01:03:46,447
Do you remember? That day when
there was a fight, your bracelet fell down.

822
01:03:46,856 --> 01:03:50,417
It tooK me whole night to fix it.
TaKe it. Now, it is very strong.

823
01:03:50,626 --> 01:03:51,752
Would you liKe some tea or coffee?

824
01:03:51,961 --> 01:03:55,124
No. No tea or coffee for me.
I am too health conscious.

825
01:03:55,331 --> 01:03:58,232
Really. Even Natasha doesn't
liKe tea or coffee.

826
01:03:58,434 --> 01:04:02,530
Oh, that's very nice.
What a coincidence! Very nice.

827
01:04:02,972 --> 01:04:03,734
Then...

828
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:13,274
But I drinK juice.
- I'll bring it in a moment.

829
01:04:19,722 --> 01:04:21,314
Tell me something about your family.

830
01:04:21,524 --> 01:04:22,752
Bitter Gourd. - Bitter Gourd?

831
01:04:23,459 --> 01:04:26,189
AsK him to add Bitter Gourd in the juice.

832
01:04:26,963 --> 01:04:29,693
Yes, sure. - You got it.

833
01:04:33,936 --> 01:04:35,267
Jayantilal...

834
01:04:38,007 --> 01:04:40,134
Do you have Ginger? - Yes.

835
01:04:40,343 --> 01:04:42,174
Add that too in the juice.

836
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:44,771
Jayantilal!

837
01:04:45,081 --> 01:04:48,482
Do you have spinach? - Yes.

838
01:04:48,684 --> 01:04:49,981
Add that too in the juice.

839
01:05:07,036 --> 01:05:09,061
Do you have Red pepper? - Yes.

840
01:05:09,272 --> 01:05:10,330
Add that also in the juice.

841
01:05:14,043 --> 01:05:16,375
It seems to be a very special juice.

842
01:05:36,499 --> 01:05:38,467
OK girls, I am ready.

843
01:05:38,801 --> 01:05:41,167
And the juice is also ready.

844
01:05:47,576 --> 01:05:51,603
Why did you wrap
Jayantilal in the blanKet?

845
01:05:51,814 --> 01:05:53,679
He was feeling very cold.
That' why I wrapped it on him...

846
01:05:53,883 --> 01:05:57,341
...without your permission.
I hope you don't mind.

847
01:05:57,553 --> 01:05:59,612
How sweet! - You are right.

848
01:06:00,056 --> 01:06:01,250
Here is your juice.

849
01:06:01,457 --> 01:06:04,324
Juice! Don't give him juice.
I will drinK that juice.

850
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:07,688
This juice is not for me.
This is for Tommy.

851
01:06:07,897 --> 01:06:10,127
His hand will be restored
if he drinKs this juice.

852
01:06:20,242 --> 01:06:22,335
Natasha looKs wonderful, isn't she?

853
01:06:22,511 --> 01:06:24,945
ThanK you so much for coming.
I am so glad.

854
01:06:25,147 --> 01:06:28,275
I can't tell you how well you sang.

855
01:06:28,951 --> 01:06:31,749
Excuse me. Excuse me. Congratulations!

856
01:06:32,054 --> 01:06:33,146
Madam, today your album
is being launched.

857
01:06:33,356 --> 01:06:35,085
Your album is called 'Man Of My Dreams'.

858
01:06:35,324 --> 01:06:37,792
Can you tell us who the man
of your dreams is?

859
01:06:38,694 --> 01:06:41,162
Right now, I am living in my dreams.
Let me be there for some time.

860
01:06:41,364 --> 01:06:42,854
I will tell you when I waKe up.

861
01:06:43,065 --> 01:06:50,972
Very smart. Very smart.

862
01:06:51,774 --> 01:06:56,234
RocKy, thanK you so much for coming.

863
01:06:57,013 --> 01:06:59,811
A beautiful rose for a beautiful lady.

864
01:07:00,216 --> 01:07:01,080
ThanK you.

865
01:07:03,619 --> 01:07:08,613
OKay, I want to tell you something. - Yes.

866
01:07:09,325 --> 01:07:13,762
Natasha. - Sanju.

867
01:07:15,431 --> 01:07:17,228
Why is he here?

868
01:07:17,333 --> 01:07:20,063
Sanju, I am so happy that
you are here. - ThanK you.

869
01:07:20,269 --> 01:07:22,362
I will introduce you to someone.
- Of course!

870
01:07:23,139 --> 01:07:23,935
Be careful.

871
01:07:26,642 --> 01:07:28,701
Meet him. He is Mr. RocKy.

872
01:07:29,378 --> 01:07:30,675
He is India's no. 1 architect.

873
01:07:32,214 --> 01:07:33,340
Are you also an architect?

874
01:07:33,582 --> 01:07:36,642
Who else is an architect over here?

875
01:07:36,852 --> 01:07:38,376
Actually Sanju is also an architect.

876
01:07:40,523 --> 01:07:43,651
I see. You too are an architect?
Nice, very nice.

877
01:07:43,893 --> 01:07:44,484
When will the program start?

878
01:07:44,693 --> 01:07:47,719
From which university did you graduate?

879
01:07:49,331 --> 01:07:53,631
That was in... - Oxford.

880
01:07:53,836 --> 01:07:54,962
Yes, Oxford university.

881
01:07:57,106 --> 01:07:58,596
Oxford! And what all
buildings did you design?

882
01:07:59,108 --> 01:08:03,875
I built the Taj Mahal.

883
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:05,547
You built the Taj Mahal!?

884
01:08:05,948 --> 01:08:08,314
But Sahjahan claims that
he built the Taj Mahal.

885
01:08:08,517 --> 01:08:10,678
Hotel Taj Mahal in Mumbai.

886
01:08:10,886 --> 01:08:13,719
You built the hotel Taj Mahal in Mumbai?

887
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:15,584
I didn't build the Taj Mahal hotel
in Mumbai...

888
01:08:15,791 --> 01:08:18,419
...but next to it is a building
with a glass fa¢ade.

889
01:08:18,627 --> 01:08:22,563
That means you also into...
- what? - Into glass business?

890
01:08:22,765 --> 01:08:27,031
Excuse me. That glass building was
built by Oberoi brothers.

891
01:08:27,303 --> 01:08:30,295
Absolutely right. Oberoi builders
did build that.

892
01:08:30,506 --> 01:08:33,304
But I am the one who designed it.

893
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:37,944
But I put a condition that my name
should not be revealed.

894
01:08:38,147 --> 01:08:40,445
And what else have you built?

895
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:46,182
Isn't it hot here?

896
01:08:46,388 --> 01:08:49,357
They are asKing what else you built.
The AC is full.

897
01:08:50,759 --> 01:08:51,783
Did you see the Red Fort?

898
01:08:51,994 --> 01:08:53,621
Red Fort, nonsense.

899
01:08:53,829 --> 01:08:56,957
If you have built the Red Fort,
then I have built the qutub Minar.

900
01:08:57,166 --> 01:08:59,066
Why are you getting angry?

901
01:08:59,268 --> 01:09:03,637
I was talKing about
Red Fort undergarments...

902
01:09:03,839 --> 01:09:06,137
So, you also have
the business of undergarments? - No.

903
01:09:06,342 --> 01:09:10,301
No. I built the factory
for the owner of that company.

904
01:09:10,513 --> 01:09:12,606
And what else have you built?

905
01:09:13,916 --> 01:09:19,980
I built parKing lots, parKs, entrances...

906
01:09:20,856 --> 01:09:23,984
...toilets, and the plaster on their walls.

907
01:09:24,193 --> 01:09:27,594
Should only I list my achievements
or will someone...

908
01:09:27,796 --> 01:09:31,459
...asK him about his worK.
You say something.

909
01:09:31,767 --> 01:09:35,203
This happens always. When two persons
of the same field meet, they speaK liKe that.

910
01:09:35,404 --> 01:09:36,564
Ladies and Gentleman!

911
01:09:36,939 --> 01:09:38,531
May I have your attention please.
- LooK boy, looK.

912
01:09:39,508 --> 01:09:40,338
Come...

913
01:09:40,676 --> 01:09:44,009
world Gold Council
and D'damas Gold

914
01:09:44,346 --> 01:09:47,645
...presents you the most
sensational music album...

915
01:09:54,590 --> 01:09:59,618
And now we also liKe to present, collection
G'gold jewellery to Natasha.

916
01:10:07,536 --> 01:10:09,504
Are you happy, invalid?

917
01:10:14,443 --> 01:10:18,209
Let's now watch Natasha
exclusively on zoom.

918
01:10:33,028 --> 01:10:35,087
Watch this Munna.

919
01:10:40,970 --> 01:10:46,101
Father, Tanya, Dubai.

920
01:10:48,043 --> 01:10:50,671
Hey, son of Subramaniam,
why are you shouting?

921
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:53,211
I brought this Idli and Dosa for you.

922
01:10:53,449 --> 01:10:57,647
And there are many more things
that you have to bring.

923
01:10:57,853 --> 01:11:00,413
I searched a lot and found Tanya.
Tanya is in Dubai.

924
01:11:04,326 --> 01:11:06,317
Dad, she is the girl that has the parrot.

925
01:11:13,636 --> 01:11:18,039
You will definitely get married.
Let's go to Dubai.

926
01:11:21,477 --> 01:11:30,442
My son, can you recognize her,
I mean my daughter-in-law?

927
01:11:30,686 --> 01:11:33,780
I can recognize Tanya even
without looKing at her.

928
01:11:34,823 --> 01:11:39,385
You fool! How can you recognize her
without looKing at her?

929
01:11:39,662 --> 01:11:43,223
Uncle, you don't Know that his nose
is liKe that of a dog.

930
01:11:43,432 --> 01:11:45,297
I can smell Tanya.

931
01:11:47,269 --> 01:11:48,463
Don't worry dad.

932
01:11:49,538 --> 01:11:54,237
She is in Dubai.
How can she escape from us?

933
01:11:54,376 --> 01:11:56,867
Oh, you have a point.
Let's move forward.

934
01:12:06,055 --> 01:12:08,888
We were supposed to come at 6.
Why did we come early?

935
01:12:09,658 --> 01:12:11,125
If we hear them in advance...

936
01:12:11,327 --> 01:12:13,955
...we will get to Know
what the girl has in mind.

937
01:12:14,163 --> 01:12:15,221
TaKe out your baton quicKly.

938
01:12:15,431 --> 01:12:16,295
That is not needed now.

939
01:12:16,498 --> 01:12:18,693
I fitted a microphone in her bracelet.

940
01:12:18,901 --> 01:12:20,232
What are you saying!?

941
01:12:24,807 --> 01:12:28,470
Do you thinK that RocKy is coming
on a special purpose?

942
01:12:28,944 --> 01:12:29,842
I don't Know.

943
01:12:30,312 --> 01:12:31,643
Quiet...

944
01:12:32,081 --> 01:12:35,517
what will you say if he proposes to you?

945
01:12:36,151 --> 01:12:37,140
I don't Know.

946
01:12:38,287 --> 01:12:39,948
But I Know that.

947
01:12:40,155 --> 01:12:41,122
The aunty seems to be on our side.

948
01:12:41,323 --> 01:12:43,689
I shall have a temple made for her.

949
01:12:49,098 --> 01:12:52,090
Beggars are lining up even before the
temple is built. - What!?

950
01:12:55,204 --> 01:12:57,502
What will he say after going in?

951
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:03,335
Natasha, I came here to say
something important. - Important!?

952
01:13:04,313 --> 01:13:04,802
What is it?

953
01:13:05,013 --> 01:13:08,176
Stay away from RocKy.

954
01:13:10,419 --> 01:13:12,512
Why? What happened?

955
01:13:12,821 --> 01:13:14,516
He is a fraud.

956
01:13:15,891 --> 01:13:18,223
He is not an architect as he claims to be.

957
01:13:19,161 --> 01:13:20,128
What are you saying!?

958
01:13:20,329 --> 01:13:22,957
Yes, he is not an architect...

959
01:13:23,332 --> 01:13:25,857
...or even a small time mason,
for that matter.

960
01:13:27,536 --> 01:13:28,798
This bastard is putting braKes
in their relationship.

961
01:13:29,004 --> 01:13:30,198
But he is invalid, isn't it?

962
01:13:33,709 --> 01:13:34,733
I'm finished now.

963
01:13:36,478 --> 01:13:39,777
I have checKed all Institutes fo
Architecture on the net.

964
01:13:39,982 --> 01:13:42,382
RocKy's name isn't in any of them.

965
01:13:44,086 --> 01:13:46,486
Why did he lie to me, then?

966
01:13:46,688 --> 01:13:48,053
If you don't believe me,
I can give you the name...

967
01:13:48,257 --> 01:13:51,954
...of that website from my dairy.
ChecK yourself.

968
01:13:54,897 --> 01:14:01,166
Don't be sympathetic to me
because I am handicapped.

969
01:14:43,245 --> 01:14:46,681
I found out his address too.

970
01:14:46,882 --> 01:14:49,043
I will reveal the truth about him
in a day or two.

971
01:14:50,352 --> 01:14:52,980
Everything will be oKay, boss.

972
01:14:54,122 --> 01:14:56,113
I'll go and teach him a
lesson just now.

973
01:14:56,325 --> 01:14:58,316
He is anyway going to
come here at 6 pm.

974
01:14:58,527 --> 01:15:00,119
I cannot Keep quiet that long.

975
01:15:00,963 --> 01:15:02,692
She is coming this way. Run!

976
01:15:03,765 --> 01:15:06,325
Hey, let's drive off!

977
01:15:22,484 --> 01:15:25,419
Boss, she has come.

978
01:15:26,889 --> 01:15:28,117
Why did you tell her?

979
01:15:28,323 --> 01:15:30,188
Why do you want to ruin my home?

980
01:15:30,392 --> 01:15:31,950
Why do you want to ruin my home?

981
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:33,286
Why are you beating me up?

982
01:15:33,896 --> 01:15:35,727
Why did you tell my mother?
- What?

983
01:15:35,931 --> 01:15:36,920
That I am not an architect.

984
01:15:37,132 --> 01:15:38,861
And that I am a captain in the Navy.

985
01:15:40,135 --> 01:15:44,367
You don't Know that
my mother hates water and the sea.

986
01:15:44,573 --> 01:15:47,098
Why does she hate it?

987
01:15:47,743 --> 01:15:48,710
I'll tell you that.

988
01:15:49,311 --> 01:15:50,744
What am I to say?

989
01:15:51,046 --> 01:15:56,541
My father was the Captain
if the ship Samrat.

990
01:15:57,452 --> 01:16:00,012
My elder brother was its Vice Captain.

991
01:16:01,657 --> 01:16:05,058
When that ship sunK in the sea...

992
01:16:06,361 --> 01:16:08,761
...both of them died.

993
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:14,369
My mother hates water from that day.

994
01:16:14,770 --> 01:16:16,397
She wouldn't even let me
taKe a bath in my childhood.

995
01:16:16,605 --> 01:16:19,039
I used to bathe secretly
at some neighbour's place.

996
01:16:21,677 --> 01:16:24,407
But my father's blood runs thicK in me.

997
01:16:25,347 --> 01:16:28,874
And the sea becKoned me one fine day.

998
01:16:29,818 --> 01:16:34,312
But why did you tell my mother
that I am not an architect...

999
01:16:34,523 --> 01:16:37,754
...and that I am a Captain in the Navy?

1000
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:40,658
You've made me an orphan.

1001
01:16:41,730 --> 01:16:44,699
Who will love this forlorn child now?

1002
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:46,993
Who will love me now?

1003
01:16:47,269 --> 01:16:50,432
Tell me from where I should get love.

1004
01:16:52,074 --> 01:16:55,271
Natasha, when did you come?

1005
01:16:59,448 --> 01:17:02,178
Babloo, why didn't you tell me
that she came?

1006
01:17:02,384 --> 01:17:03,942
You are so naive!

1007
01:17:08,557 --> 01:17:10,855
Natasha, I want to tell you that...

1008
01:17:13,996 --> 01:17:15,759
You need not say anything.

1009
01:17:17,799 --> 01:17:19,130
I heard it all.

1010
01:17:23,472 --> 01:17:25,531
You are not alone anymore from today.

1011
01:17:27,609 --> 01:17:29,167
How good-natured you are!

1012
01:17:34,850 --> 01:17:36,374
You are very Kind.

1013
01:17:37,452 --> 01:17:39,886
You are the one from whom
I'll get all my love.

1014
01:18:22,998 --> 01:18:25,228
Hello friends!

1015
01:18:25,467 --> 01:18:28,095
The second part has begun.

1016
01:18:28,503 --> 01:18:30,903
Karan's love is in danger.

1017
01:18:31,139 --> 01:18:33,972
Tanya fell into RocKy's trap.

1018
01:18:34,276 --> 01:18:37,074
Till now there was one love story,
but now we have two.

1019
01:18:37,479 --> 01:18:40,573
What will Karan do?

1020
01:18:40,849 --> 01:18:42,874
