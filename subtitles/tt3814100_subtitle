1
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,366
Yeah.

2
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:02,992
Okay, sir. Yes.

3
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:04,244
Yeah.

4
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:05,453
Aarav Anand.

5
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,583
Aarav Anand!
- Yeah?

6
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:12,711
You can go in now.

7
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:13,962
Yeah!

8
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,924
Thank you.
- Okay.

9
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:23,930
Sir.

10
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:25,598
Come, Aarav.

11
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:27,684
Hi, sir.

12
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:29,019
Sit.

13
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:32,147
Thank you so much
for your time, sir.

14
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,231
It's okay.

15
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:35,734
How's your father?
- He's fine.

16
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:48,913
So you want a loan?
- Yes, sir.

17
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:53,251
Let me see.

18
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:58,381
Yeah, just send
Ajay and Neha in.

19
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:06,639
2.5 million!

20
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:09,225
Isn't that a big amount?

21
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,061
Yes.

22
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:15,398
Yes, sir.
- Come.

23
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,153
She's Neha, Ajay.
- Hi!

24
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,947
He's Aarav.
He wants a loan from our bank.

25
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,458
2.5 million?

26
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:39,589
And what do you want
to use this money for?

27
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:43,677
Sir, I want to build
a dance crew

28
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:47,305
and take them to the biggest
dance competition in the world.

29
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,265
And India has never
qualified till date.

30
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:52,060
Sorry, did I hear you right?

31
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,396
You want to build a dance crew?

32
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:57,941
Sir.. Are you out of your mind?

33
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,236
I suggest, Mr. Aarav

34
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:06,449
why don't you ask your family
or friends for help?

35
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:08,576
Sir, they've already
done enough.

36
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:15,709
Sir, there's absolutely
nothing to decide.

37
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,461
No guarantor, no fixed-income.

38
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:20,380
Absolutely nothing, sir.

39
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:22,924
Think about it.

40
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:31,016
By the way,
why do you want to do this?

41
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,686
Because no one else
is doing it, sir.

42
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:37,313
What's the guarantee
that you'll return this money?

43
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:38,982
Is there any guarantee?

44
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:42,318
Is anyone supporting you?

45
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:43,611
Guarantor.

46
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:47,323
No, sir.

47
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,577
Is it a joke, sir?

48
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:53,496
Are you joking with us?

49
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:56,541
Sir, he wants to borrow
2.5 million

50
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,668
but doesn't have a guarantor.

51
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:00,920
We don't know whether

52
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,964
you'll payback
this money or not.

53
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:07,052
And you want this money
to open up a dance-academy.

54
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:09,304
Not a dance-academy.

55
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:11,389
I want to train my crew.

56
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:15,060
Dance crews from all
over the world participate.

57
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:17,312
But no one ever qualified
from our country.

58
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,396
Sir.

59
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,940
It's the World Cup of dance.

60
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:23,360
The biggest dance
battle in the world.

61
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:25,904
And I think we're ready, sir.

62
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,036
And your crew will
represent India?

63
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:35,872
That's the intention.

64
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:37,332
Is it that easy?

65
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:39,709
Are you sure you can do it?

66
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:41,044
Yes, sir.

67
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:45,131
How can you be so confident?
- Because I did it once before.

68
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:47,467
What have you done?

69
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,052
Represent India?

70
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:50,929
Meaning?

71
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,393
Sir, I've always loved dancing.

72
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,020
Popping, Locking, B-boying..

73
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:02,565
And like every kid,
even I had a teacher.

74
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:04,025
Ceaser!

75
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:13,284
I lied to my parents

76
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:15,286
that I want to study MBA

77
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,580
and reached Sheffield.

78
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,624
Ceaser's hometown.

79
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,293
A city of 700,000 people.

80
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,505
Students everywhere.

81
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,758
But I wanted to
meet just one man.

82
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:30,552
My teacher.

83
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,678
Ceaser.

84
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:34,055
I just wanted to join his crew.

85
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:38,601
I got admission in MBA

86
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,896
all I had to do was
find a place to stay.

87
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:56,077
Excuse me.
- Hi.

88
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,787
Hi. Can you help me?

89
00:08:57,954 --> 00:09:02,417
Can you tell me where
I can find Salim Qureshi?

90
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,919
He's right there
in the white 'kurta'.

91
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,928
Why did you miss class?
- Brother..

92
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:16,056
I would've missed my interview
if I had attended class.

93
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,724
If you don't have
full attendance

94
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:19,184
what's the point
of giving an interview?

95
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:22,020
Excuse me.
I am looking for accommodation.

96
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,814
Where are you from?
- India.

97
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:29,778
So you're serious.
You want to be in Ceaser's crew?

98
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:31,613
You must be
a terrific dancer then.

99
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:34,366
I'll know that
when I meet Ceaser.

100
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:36,326
Do you know where he lives?

101
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:40,080
No. I've just seen
a few videos on YouTube.

102
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:42,707
Focus on your studies, Aarav.

103
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:44,626
Don't mingle with
these Britishers.

104
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,461
They're good to no one.

105
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:49,047
What's wrong with him?

106
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,800
We attained freedom from
the Britishers, Salim.

107
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:54,302
Why are you still
stuck on Dandi March?

108
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:03,019
This is the room. 60 Pounds.

109
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:09,317
Salim, water.
- Yes.

110
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:13,113
This is Dipen,
he lives in the room next door.

111
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:15,031
Yo man! Hi.
- Hi!

112
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:20,078
60 pounds a month, right?
- No.

113
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:21,663
A 60 pounds a week.

114
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,088
Nothing less?

115
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:32,465
No. You won't get it
for anything less.

116
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,970
Salim, if you don't mind

117
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:38,763
you can share my room.

118
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:42,851
At 50 pounds per week,
we'll have to pay 25 each.

119
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:44,310
Good for me too.

120
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,982
It's perfect for me.
- Yeah!

121
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:50,316
Fine.

122
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:52,027
Yes..
- A 100 pound deposit.

123
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:54,612
And one month's rent advance.

124
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:00,785
I don't have all of it
but, I'll pay the rest, soon.

125
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:02,495
This won't do.

126
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,832
Next time, all together
and on time.

127
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,922
Thanks, man.
- Welcome.

128
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:15,008
Where's your luggage?
- Downstairs.

129
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:16,551
Hungry?
- Starving.

130
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,470
Come on, I know a nice place.

131
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,013
Tell me something.

132
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:24,100
You live in one of the rooms
and the other is empty.

133
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:25,560
Who stays in
the other two rooms?

134
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:27,812
GG stays in the room upstairs.

135
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:30,273
Gagan Gulati.
He's from Punjab.

136
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,817
The only son of rich parents.

137
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,488
GG means fun, all the time.

138
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:39,407
He changes girlfriends
every week.

139
00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:41,451
But only on Facebook.

140
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,578
Because until today no one's

141
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:46,247
ever seen him with
a girl in reality.

142
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:49,584
This room belongs to Atul Murli.
He's from Kerala.

143
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:50,877
Brilliant student.

144
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:53,672
Always tops the class.
Less fun, more work.

145
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:55,924
GG calls him a coward.

146
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,509
By the way, he learns karate

147
00:11:57,634 --> 00:11:59,803
and also teaches Capoeira
in some academy.

148
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,888
But he's scared doing that too.

149
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:11,898
Which course are you studying?
- Nothing yet.

150
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:14,943
But I want to study MBA.

151
00:12:15,694 --> 00:12:18,196
The fee is too high.

152
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:20,448
So I am working in
my uncle's restaurant.

153
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:23,201
He deposits my salary
in his account.

154
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:25,328
And when there's
enough to pay the fee

155
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:26,955
I'll take the admission as well.

156
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:28,623
Not bad.

157
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:33,294
Anyway, get some rest.

158
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:35,213
I'll see you later.
- Thank you.

159
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:52,063
Atul, what are you doing?
Pass that properly.

160
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:53,898
Atul..

161
00:12:54,024 --> 00:12:56,901
You don't know to play, eh?
Why do you place bets?

162
00:12:57,527 --> 00:12:58,737
Darn! Bad player.

163
00:12:58,862 --> 00:13:00,447
Atul, take it.

164
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:02,490
We've been playing
since last night.

165
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:04,325
Please let me take
some rest. Please.

166
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:06,786
Atul, please. I've already
lost two matches because of you.

167
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:09,039
I don't want to lose to China.
Please play.

168
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:12,208
Which team is it?
- I can help you beat them.

169
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:13,835
Who is he?

170
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:16,504
Aarav.
- Aarav, who?

171
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,883
Your new house-mate.
- From?

172
00:13:21,051 --> 00:13:22,177
India.

173
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:29,351
So you two have met?

174
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:00,757
And they say we can't
play football, right?

175
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:02,008
See that, Atul?

176
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:05,345
GG made India win
with a little help.

177
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:06,179
Right.
- Yes.

178
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:07,222
You did everything.

179
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:08,640
We were just sitting
here holding the remote.

180
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:09,557
Oh shut up.

181
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:12,352
Aarav, thank you so much.
Thank you so much.

182
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:15,480
If you need anything, ask GG.
GG owes you one.

183
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:16,439
GG owes you.

184
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:19,442
Think about it, Aarav.
He says that to everyone.

185
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:22,362
Hey, shut up.
They are just jealous.

186
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:23,613
Ask for anything.

187
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,036
There is one thing.

188
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:39,838
I had just one goal
behind going to Sheffield.

189
00:14:41,006 --> 00:14:44,134
Finding Ceaser
and joining his crew.

190
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:48,930
So without wasting any time,
I started my hunt.

191
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,267
But finding him
wasn't an easy job.

192
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:54,936
He was a difficult man to find.

193
00:14:56,438 --> 00:14:58,523
And luckily I found
some good friends.

194
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:00,108
They helped me settle in.

195
00:15:04,446 --> 00:15:06,322
And GG even helped me out.

196
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:13,371
Didn't I tell you I'll find him
in 24 hours?

197
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:14,706
Find who?

198
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,583
Ceaser.

199
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:21,755
Yes! Look.

200
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:23,715
GG's the best.

201
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:25,800
This isn't Ceaser.

202
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:30,013
Loosen up, I know.
But she can take you to Ceaser.

203
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,644
Look, she's the only
Indian dancer in his group.

204
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:38,480
Right now she's
just a backup dancer.

205
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,398
But she wants to get
in the main crew.

206
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:42,233
And I know where to find her.

207
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:45,904
There's just one problem.
Her brother, Salim.

208
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:46,821
Salim?

209
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:49,491
Asian Community President.
That's the bad news.

210
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,201
That grouch.

211
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:53,161
And his sister's
a bigger grouch.

212
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:55,455
They party at Club Embrace
every day.

213
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:58,208
We can meet her there.
I have connections there.

214
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:00,960
What say?

215
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,981
This is GG's area.

216
00:16:22,107 --> 00:16:23,692
GG knows everybody.

217
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:25,110
You all right, baby?

218
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:27,028
Come on.
We'll have a few shots.

219
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:29,489
Cool! Come on.

220
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:33,284
What's up?

221
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:38,748
That's Aashira.
- Which one?

222
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:40,208
That chick in black.

223
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:42,544
Massive difference
between brother and sister.

224
00:16:42,711 --> 00:16:44,963
Innit?
- Yeah man, innit.

225
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:47,882
One's 20 years behind
civilization

226
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:49,884
and the other's 20 years ahead.

227
00:16:52,637 --> 00:16:53,680
I am going.

228
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:55,724
Take care.

229
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:57,976
This chick don't like brownies.

230
00:16:58,143 --> 00:16:59,728
Only black or white.

231
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:01,438
Yeah?
- We'll see.

232
00:17:07,152 --> 00:17:08,319
He's gone for good.

233
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:11,197
Hi. Excuse me?

234
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:14,117
What?
- I want to meet Ceaser.

235
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:18,455
You want to meet Ceaser.
- Yeah, I want to join his crew.

236
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:20,415
Why don't you just
get lost, yeah!

237
00:18:57,846 --> 00:19:00,640
You want to dance off, mate?
Do with me.

238
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:02,851
He's Ceaser's right-hand man.

239
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:04,686
He wants to meet Ceaser.

240
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:07,105
Everybody wants to meet Ceaser.

241
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:09,649
Look, mate.
The only thing you want to do

242
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:11,276
is get out of here.

243
00:19:12,444 --> 00:19:14,362
Let's go, Aarav.
- Trust me.

244
00:19:16,031 --> 00:19:17,198
Come on!

245
00:19:22,287 --> 00:19:23,496
Excuse me.

246
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:25,498
I would've bashed him.

247
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,626
Only if he hadn't stopped me.

248
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:30,920
If I had locked horns with Henry

249
00:19:31,046 --> 00:19:33,506
I would've lost my chance
to join Ceaser's crew.

250
00:19:33,715 --> 00:19:36,217
Why is Ceaser such a big secret?

251
00:19:36,343 --> 00:19:38,053
In a small city like Sheffield

252
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:40,180
it should not be
difficult to find him.

253
00:19:40,347 --> 00:19:42,807
Sheffield means 700,000 people.

254
00:19:42,974 --> 00:19:44,476
Where?
- Get lost!

255
00:19:45,268 --> 00:19:46,061
I don't see them.

256
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:48,271
Besides, this is an
underground dance competition.

257
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:50,315
And they dance
for the love of it.

258
00:19:50,482 --> 00:19:52,233
Not for the money or the glitz.

259
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,362
He's such a bore. I've an idea,
let's kidnap Salim's sister.

260
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:56,446
GG.

261
00:19:56,613 --> 00:19:59,074
What the..
- Darn.

262
00:19:59,574 --> 00:20:01,451
What happened?
- Don't be scared. Coward.

263
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:02,535
What happened?
- AJ.

264
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:03,953
Look, that's AJ.

265
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:07,040
Just like you, he came here
to join a dance crew.

266
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,876
And what's he doing now?
Eating bread on the streets.

267
00:20:10,085 --> 00:20:11,836
It's a burger.
- Same thing.

268
00:20:12,003 --> 00:20:13,797
Listen, take my advice.

269
00:20:13,922 --> 00:20:16,758
Forget dancing
and join Capoeira with Atul.

270
00:20:16,925 --> 00:20:19,010
End of problem.
- End of the problem, my foot!

271
00:20:19,636 --> 00:20:21,638
He did it, didn't he?
Didn't he?

272
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:27,268
That day I was scared
on seeing AJ.

273
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:30,230
I immediately found
him on Facebook.

274
00:20:31,314 --> 00:20:32,941
He was an exceptional dancer.

275
00:20:37,529 --> 00:20:39,531
I asked him about Ceaser too.

276
00:20:43,034 --> 00:20:44,661
But he didn't help me.

277
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:47,330
Instead he asked me
to stay away.

278
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:51,084
I couldn't concentrate
at the University.

279
00:20:52,502 --> 00:20:53,795
And I was running out of money.

280
00:20:53,962 --> 00:20:55,714
10 Pounds for 4 hours?

281
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,091
But that isn't even
minimal wage, sir.

282
00:20:58,633 --> 00:21:01,886
You want work,
I don't need another help.

283
00:21:03,221 --> 00:21:05,932
It's only because Dipen asked,
I am giving you so much.

284
00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:08,143
But...

285
00:21:11,146 --> 00:21:13,898
Dipen requested his uncle
and got me a job.

286
00:21:15,025 --> 00:21:18,236
During the day
I would look for Ceaser

287
00:21:18,361 --> 00:21:20,613
and clean plates at night
in the restaurant.

288
00:21:21,656 --> 00:21:23,241
But I still didn't find him.

289
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:26,119
I lied to my parents
and came here.

290
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:29,205
So sometimes I couldn't
sleep due to guilt.

291
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:33,251
But I didn't give up.

292
00:21:33,877 --> 00:21:35,128
I tried everything.

293
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:38,506
Come on. Take a look at the boy.

294
00:21:38,673 --> 00:21:40,967
I can't, mom.
I'm late for the practice.

295
00:21:41,092 --> 00:21:43,428
Dear, even you can
find a boy for yourself.

296
00:21:43,553 --> 00:21:44,929
Aashira.

297
00:21:46,431 --> 00:21:48,266
Move.
- Mother's calling.

298
00:21:49,267 --> 00:21:51,519
Thank you, ma'am.
But I am not interested

299
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:54,230
in marrying any Indian
or any Asian. - Why?

300
00:21:54,397 --> 00:21:56,066
What did Indians do now?

301
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:58,068
Nothing.

302
00:21:58,693 --> 00:21:59,944
They are all lovely.

303
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:01,905
In fact,
we had a great Indian guy

304
00:22:02,072 --> 00:22:03,823
who lived in our family.
Didn't we, Salim?

305
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,533
Who one day abandoned my mom

306
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,869
and his two children
out on the streets.

307
00:22:07,994 --> 00:22:09,204
That's enough, Aashira.

308
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:11,664
And do you know what
the best part is, ma'am?

309
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:12,957
I'll tell you the best part.

310
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:14,459
He lives in the same city

311
00:22:14,584 --> 00:22:16,169
and he hasn't even
bothered to call once.

312
00:22:16,336 --> 00:22:17,629
Behave, Aashira.

313
00:22:17,754 --> 00:22:19,464
This is not your friend's home.

314
00:22:19,631 --> 00:22:21,341
In this house,
we respect family.

315
00:22:21,508 --> 00:22:22,634
Respect?

316
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,637
Isn't it just a bit ironic
to you, Salim

317
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:28,014
that the man you're
talking about

318
00:22:28,139 --> 00:22:31,184
left me, you and her
for an English woman?

319
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:36,189
Aarav!

320
00:22:37,148 --> 00:22:38,274
Aarav.

321
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:41,695
Aarav.

322
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:44,239
Look where I just
made a delivery.

323
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:46,449
And he's asked for more.

324
00:22:46,783 --> 00:22:48,910
Where?
- Ceaser's studio, Aarav.

325
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,372
Come on, wake up.
We have to go. Come on.

326
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:57,502
Yeah.

327
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:00,547
Ready?

328
00:23:03,967 --> 00:23:06,511
Who is it?
- Delivery. Chaska.

329
00:23:06,678 --> 00:23:08,054
Come in.

330
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:10,015
All the best.

331
00:23:37,459 --> 00:23:38,710
Oh my gosh!

332
00:23:42,797 --> 00:23:43,965
Can I help you?

333
00:23:44,174 --> 00:23:46,301
Hi, I am Aarav.
- Ceaser.

334
00:23:46,551 --> 00:23:48,345
I am a huge, huge fan, man.

335
00:23:48,553 --> 00:23:51,097
I've been following you
for the past five years.

336
00:23:51,264 --> 00:23:53,016
Everything I know
is by watching you dance.

337
00:23:53,183 --> 00:23:54,601
I.. I love the way you dance.

338
00:23:54,768 --> 00:23:56,936
I've come all the way from
India, just to join your crew.

339
00:23:57,062 --> 00:23:58,855
Why don't you stick
to delivering food, bro?

340
00:23:59,022 --> 00:24:00,065
Not funny!

341
00:24:02,484 --> 00:24:04,444
You're Indian, right?
- Yes.

342
00:24:04,611 --> 00:24:06,821
I've never seen
a Indian boy dance.

343
00:24:09,324 --> 00:24:11,117
You know what a dance off is?

344
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:13,453
Yeah, I do.

345
00:24:13,578 --> 00:24:14,829
I'll make you a deal.

346
00:24:15,372 --> 00:24:17,290
Beat Henry and you're in.

347
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:19,542
Excuse me?

348
00:24:20,418 --> 00:24:22,545
Beat Henry, in a one-on-one

349
00:24:23,338 --> 00:24:25,882
and you're in the crew,
for sure.

350
00:24:27,175 --> 00:24:28,301
Henry!

351
00:26:36,513 --> 00:26:38,181
This ain't for you, my friend.

352
00:26:38,348 --> 00:26:40,183
You come back when
you're at your best.

353
00:26:40,433 --> 00:26:42,143
We don't take
any less than that.

354
00:26:46,481 --> 00:26:49,025
Come on. Time to go.

355
00:26:51,111 --> 00:26:52,445
End of story.

356
00:26:52,612 --> 00:26:53,780
The end.

357
00:26:54,406 --> 00:26:55,615
You understand?

358
00:26:56,658 --> 00:26:58,827
Hey Aashira,
you speak his language.

359
00:26:58,952 --> 00:26:59,994
Come here.

360
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,957
There's something
I want you to tell him.

361
00:27:04,124 --> 00:27:06,876
And tell him in his language
so that he gets it good.

362
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:11,464
Tell him, I don't want to
see his sorry beaten face

363
00:27:11,631 --> 00:27:12,757
around here again.

364
00:27:12,882 --> 00:27:15,301
Because he doesn't deserve
to be one of us.

365
00:27:15,802 --> 00:27:19,139
Don't ever show
your face here again.

366
00:27:19,264 --> 00:27:20,015
Okay?

367
00:27:20,181 --> 00:27:22,809
Because you aren't
worthy of being one of us.

368
00:27:23,018 --> 00:27:25,145
You brownies can go be waiters.

369
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:26,604
Caterers.

370
00:27:27,689 --> 00:27:28,898
Or cabbies.

371
00:27:29,065 --> 00:27:30,942
Or go beg at a subway somewhere.

372
00:27:31,109 --> 00:27:33,611
Cause you can never be like us.

373
00:27:34,487 --> 00:27:35,655
Tell him.

374
00:27:39,367 --> 00:27:45,081
You brownies can only be
waiters, caterers or cabbies.

375
00:27:45,331 --> 00:27:47,417
You can never be good dancers.

376
00:27:47,751 --> 00:27:52,088
Just go back to Pakistan,
India or Bangladesh

377
00:27:52,255 --> 00:27:53,673
or wherever you're from.

378
00:27:55,258 --> 00:27:57,927
India, Pakistan, wherever..

379
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:13,234
"What's this punishment?"

380
00:28:14,402 --> 00:28:20,408
"What's this mistake
You've made?"

381
00:28:20,825 --> 00:28:26,790
"My destiny's upset with me."

382
00:28:27,916 --> 00:28:33,963
"Why are my dreams away
from me?"

383
00:28:48,728 --> 00:28:54,442
"Where are You, God?"

384
00:28:55,568 --> 00:29:00,615
"Tell me where You are?"

385
00:29:02,575 --> 00:29:04,703
You brownies can go be waiters.

386
00:29:04,869 --> 00:29:06,037
Caterers.

387
00:29:06,204 --> 00:29:07,372
And cabbies.

388
00:29:09,708 --> 00:29:11,835
Cause you don't deserve
to be one of us.

389
00:29:23,805 --> 00:29:28,268
Just go back to
Pakistan, India or Bangladesh.

390
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:33,231
"Why are You quiet now?"

391
00:29:33,398 --> 00:29:36,776
"Even my shadow's
annoyed with me."

392
00:29:36,901 --> 00:29:43,241
"Why was my prayer unanswered?"

393
00:29:43,783 --> 00:29:47,120
"I'm going to shout,
I won't stay quiet."

394
00:29:47,245 --> 00:29:50,498
"I'll endure all the pain
You give me."

395
00:29:50,707 --> 00:29:57,130
"All the wounds you
inflict on me, is for me."

396
00:30:11,019 --> 00:30:16,858
"Where are You, God?"

397
00:30:17,901 --> 00:30:24,532
"Tell me where You are?"

398
00:30:40,965 --> 00:30:42,801
Aarav, there's a fantastic
party happening at the club.

399
00:30:42,967 --> 00:30:44,761
Want to go?
- I don't feel like.

400
00:30:44,928 --> 00:30:47,597
What are you doing?
- Aarav, I am coming too.

401
00:30:47,722 --> 00:30:49,557
Look, even the Capoeira
is coming.

402
00:30:50,475 --> 00:30:51,226
Guys.

403
00:30:51,393 --> 00:30:53,144
Hey what are you doing here?

404
00:30:53,853 --> 00:30:55,689
Please, just leave us alone.

405
00:30:55,855 --> 00:30:57,565
Look, I'm sorry, yeah?

406
00:30:57,774 --> 00:30:58,942
I said leave.

407
00:30:59,067 --> 00:31:00,402
Okay, fine.

408
00:31:02,821 --> 00:31:06,574
I understand.
Maybe you don't believe me.

409
00:31:07,325 --> 00:31:08,493
Look I really want you to know

410
00:31:08,618 --> 00:31:11,079
that I think you're
an amazing dancer.

411
00:31:11,496 --> 00:31:13,373
And you shouldn't
have lost that day.

412
00:31:14,332 --> 00:31:17,711
And I am..
I am really, really sorry.

413
00:31:18,753 --> 00:31:20,630
Please, you have to believe me.

414
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:27,512
Okay. I believe you.

415
00:31:29,097 --> 00:31:29,764
Can we go now?

416
00:31:29,931 --> 00:31:32,642
Actually, there's just
one more thing.

417
00:31:32,767 --> 00:31:35,353
Yeah. - Can I please
just have 5 minutes with you?

418
00:31:36,438 --> 00:31:37,856
Just 5 minutes!

419
00:31:44,195 --> 00:31:45,530
You two join up, we'll go ahead.

420
00:31:45,697 --> 00:31:46,865
What's this..

421
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:48,450
Aa..
- 5 minutes.

422
00:31:49,409 --> 00:31:50,618
I promise.

423
00:31:51,286 --> 00:31:54,748
You know, Aarav, the other day
Henry managed to beat you

424
00:31:54,914 --> 00:31:57,042
because he was
fighting a battle

425
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,377
and you were just dancing.

426
00:32:01,713 --> 00:32:04,507
I mean dance is
passion for you, right?

427
00:32:05,383 --> 00:32:07,969
But these people have
long forgotten that passion.

428
00:32:08,094 --> 00:32:10,096
Winning means
everything to them.

429
00:32:10,972 --> 00:32:13,475
Dance off is like
a boxing match.

430
00:32:13,641 --> 00:32:15,268
You have to be aggressive.

431
00:32:15,393 --> 00:32:17,687
And you can beat them,
if you learn to fight.

432
00:32:17,854 --> 00:32:19,481
If you learn how to battle.

433
00:32:20,148 --> 00:32:22,609
I don't want to defeat anyone,
okay? I am done.

434
00:32:23,318 --> 00:32:24,569
What is it that you want?

435
00:32:25,904 --> 00:32:30,241
Okay. I've got dance off
in the warehouse next week.

436
00:32:30,408 --> 00:32:32,744
And I thought you could
teach me some of your moves.

437
00:32:34,996 --> 00:32:37,374
I knew it. I knew it.
- What?

438
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:39,542
I want to show them
that we can dance too.

439
00:32:39,709 --> 00:32:41,127
Aarav.
- We?

440
00:32:42,003 --> 00:32:43,505
We're one team now, huh?

441
00:32:46,591 --> 00:32:48,593
And why me? Huh?

442
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,178
Why can't Henry teach you?

443
00:32:50,595 --> 00:32:52,847
Because I want to learn
from you. - Why?

444
00:32:52,972 --> 00:32:55,684
Because you're better than him.
And you know that too, right?

445
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:57,477
Otherwise you would've
caught a plane back to India

446
00:32:57,686 --> 00:33:00,105
the day that you were chucked
out of Ceaser's studio.

447
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:06,027
Okay, fine, I'll tell you
everything I know then

448
00:33:06,152 --> 00:33:07,987
whenever you meet Ceaser next.

449
00:33:08,571 --> 00:33:09,322
What?

450
00:33:09,489 --> 00:33:11,116
I've been in that
crew for 2 years.

451
00:33:11,324 --> 00:33:13,201
I know everything about them.

452
00:33:16,579 --> 00:33:18,456
I'll show you how to battle

453
00:33:18,623 --> 00:33:21,418
and you teach me
some of your moves.

454
00:33:23,461 --> 00:33:24,421
Deal?

455
00:33:26,923 --> 00:33:29,342
I'll see you tomorrow morning
at the University.

456
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:30,844
Yes!

457
00:33:36,641 --> 00:33:37,767
Thumbs up.

458
00:33:37,934 --> 00:33:40,186
Wow! It's really cool.
- Yes. Do it.

459
00:33:42,689 --> 00:33:44,774
Can you do it again? Please.

460
00:35:16,449 --> 00:35:18,576
Is it nice?
- It's really good.

461
00:35:19,744 --> 00:35:21,579
You should speak more in Hindi.

462
00:35:21,955 --> 00:35:23,748
Why?
- It suits you.

463
00:35:24,374 --> 00:35:25,709
Really?
- Yeah.

464
00:35:27,419 --> 00:35:29,671
Doesn't anyone else
speak in Hindi at home?

465
00:35:30,547 --> 00:35:32,507
Yeah, they do. Just not me.

466
00:35:34,801 --> 00:35:36,594
What happens when
mom fixes you up

467
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,430
with a nice Punjabi boy?

468
00:35:38,596 --> 00:35:40,515
My mom would never do that.

469
00:35:41,933 --> 00:35:44,227
Me and brownies just
don't go together.

470
00:35:46,896 --> 00:35:48,064
What about food?

471
00:35:48,189 --> 00:35:49,899
What about food?
- Indian food.

472
00:35:51,776 --> 00:35:53,528
Do you like it?
- It's all right.

473
00:35:53,695 --> 00:35:55,572
Can you make any?
- Yup.

474
00:35:56,156 --> 00:35:57,407
What can you cook?

475
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,118
I can make 'dal'.

476
00:36:00,744 --> 00:36:02,495
And I can make..

477
00:36:02,662 --> 00:36:05,498
What's that thing called?
'Saag and Makhi di roti'.

478
00:36:06,374 --> 00:36:07,417
What?

479
00:36:07,542 --> 00:36:08,585
Nothing.

480
00:36:08,752 --> 00:36:10,962
I would love to eat that.
'Saag and Makhi di roti'.

481
00:36:11,087 --> 00:36:13,173
It's quite hot though.
- I am sure it is.

482
00:36:13,298 --> 00:36:14,758
But you can't..
- Excuse me!

483
00:36:19,888 --> 00:36:20,930
What?

484
00:36:21,056 --> 00:36:22,223
Nothing.

485
00:36:22,849 --> 00:36:25,018
Get me a cappuccino.
And get it fast.

486
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:27,604
Aashira.

487
00:36:29,939 --> 00:36:30,982
What's wrong?

488
00:36:31,149 --> 00:36:32,734
Look, can we just go?

489
00:36:35,362 --> 00:36:36,488
Excuse me.

490
00:36:36,613 --> 00:36:37,697
Your money.

491
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,834
Sorry.

492
00:37:02,722 --> 00:37:04,015
Who was that man?

493
00:37:04,849 --> 00:37:06,017
My dad.

494
00:37:06,226 --> 00:37:09,104
And please,
I don't want to talk about it.

495
00:37:14,734 --> 00:37:17,696
Sorry. My family
is just a bit weird.

496
00:37:18,738 --> 00:37:20,073
It's okay.

497
00:37:21,282 --> 00:37:23,076
All our families are weird.

498
00:37:23,952 --> 00:37:26,371
Mine are really weird.

499
00:37:29,165 --> 00:37:30,625
My dad

500
00:37:31,584 --> 00:37:34,879
he left us when I was one
for an English woman.

501
00:37:38,633 --> 00:37:41,136
I guess that's why
he didn't recognize me.

502
00:37:43,096 --> 00:37:44,973
Why didn't you talk to him?

503
00:37:45,181 --> 00:37:46,391
But why should I?

504
00:37:46,516 --> 00:37:48,435
Why can't he come
and talk to us?

505
00:37:51,187 --> 00:37:53,690
You know, in fact
when I was 12

506
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:57,527
he used to have this off-licence
store in my school.

507
00:37:58,028 --> 00:38:02,073
And I'd go there every day
and wait for hours.

508
00:38:03,324 --> 00:38:06,786
All because I wanted to see the
white woman that he left us for.

509
00:38:08,621 --> 00:38:11,124
But I could never muster
the courage to go in.

510
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:17,797
Anyway, it's not like
he's dying to talk to me, is it?

511
00:38:18,673 --> 00:38:22,886
He could've tried once in all
these years, if he wanted to.

512
00:38:23,636 --> 00:38:24,596
Right?

513
00:38:25,221 --> 00:38:26,097
Right.

514
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:27,557
Yeah!

515
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:06,471
Your house.

516
00:39:07,764 --> 00:39:11,184
Where's your grouchy brother?
- Oh, don't worry about him.

517
00:39:13,061 --> 00:39:14,729
Are you coming
to the dance off tomorrow?

518
00:39:15,438 --> 00:39:16,398
Yes.

519
00:39:17,107 --> 00:39:18,441
See you.
- Yeah!

520
00:39:19,859 --> 00:39:21,152
Aarav.
- Yeah?

521
00:39:22,278 --> 00:39:23,863
Do you want to come
and sit down for a bit?

522
00:39:51,558 --> 00:39:52,976
Thanks for everything.

523
00:39:54,227 --> 00:39:55,603
You're welcome.

524
00:39:59,733 --> 00:40:01,192
It's quite cold.

525
00:40:01,818 --> 00:40:03,153
I think you should go in.

526
00:40:04,112 --> 00:40:05,613
I'll go home too.

527
00:40:06,364 --> 00:40:08,074
Okay.
- Okay.

528
00:40:09,325 --> 00:40:10,702
Aarav.
- Yeah?

529
00:40:20,045 --> 00:40:21,338
Okay.

530
00:40:22,088 --> 00:40:25,342
Aashira, I.. - No, no,
it's fine. Don't worry about it.

531
00:40:26,009 --> 00:40:29,137
I am just going to go.
I'll see you tomorrow, yeah?

532
00:40:30,972 --> 00:40:32,223
Darn!

533
00:41:16,351 --> 00:41:18,728
Hey! Where are you going?
- University.

534
00:41:18,895 --> 00:41:20,021
They're giving out
admission forms today.

535
00:41:20,146 --> 00:41:22,857
Forget the form.
- It'll close in 10 minutes.

536
00:41:22,982 --> 00:41:24,901
Nothing's going to happen.
Forget the form.

537
00:41:25,151 --> 00:41:26,027
You're going
to the warehouse with me.

538
00:41:26,194 --> 00:41:28,113
It's on.. - It's Aashira's
dance off.

539
00:41:28,279 --> 00:41:29,614
I'll get your form tomorrow.

540
00:41:31,074 --> 00:41:32,534
You took so long.
Where were you?

541
00:41:32,701 --> 00:41:34,619
Wear it quickly.
Look at the huge line.

542
00:41:34,786 --> 00:41:37,288
You won't get entry
without this. Let's go.

543
00:41:39,791 --> 00:41:41,126
Why are you looking so happy?

544
00:41:41,251 --> 00:41:43,378
Mom called today.
Talked to dad as well.

545
00:41:43,503 --> 00:41:46,131
Everyone's really happy that
I am getting admission. - Okay.

546
00:41:47,257 --> 00:41:48,591
You know, I would be
the first from Baleshwar

547
00:41:48,717 --> 00:41:49,509
to get a foreign degree.

548
00:41:49,676 --> 00:41:51,636
And the dance off begins now!

549
00:42:03,982 --> 00:42:05,108
Oh my God!

550
00:42:08,361 --> 00:42:10,030
I'm going to do it.
- Go for it.

551
00:42:33,136 --> 00:42:34,346
Oh my God!

552
00:42:37,307 --> 00:42:38,933
I can't believe I just did that.

553
00:42:39,059 --> 00:42:40,685
I honestly cannot believe it.

554
00:42:40,852 --> 00:42:42,645
How was it?
- It was perfect.

555
00:42:42,812 --> 00:42:44,814
Really? Are you sure?

556
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,816
Oh God!

557
00:42:46,983 --> 00:42:48,985
I think that we should
go and celebrate.

558
00:42:49,152 --> 00:42:49,944
And I'll treat you.

559
00:42:50,153 --> 00:42:50,904
Yeah?
- Yeah!

560
00:42:51,071 --> 00:42:53,531
And I thought
you just ill-treat us.

561
00:42:54,407 --> 00:42:55,575
What? - Doesn't matter.
Doesn't matter.

562
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:56,743
What did he say?
- He's Dipen.

563
00:42:56,868 --> 00:42:57,911
Jags-Wags.
- Hey!

564
00:42:58,036 --> 00:42:59,871
Atul. GG.

565
00:43:00,163 --> 00:43:01,498
Should we go?
- Yeah.

566
00:43:01,623 --> 00:43:03,291
Come on, I know
this really cool place.

567
00:43:03,458 --> 00:43:05,085
Five. That's a five.

568
00:43:05,919 --> 00:43:07,462
Yes, what are you
going to teach me next?

569
00:43:07,587 --> 00:43:09,214
Hey! You still here.

570
00:43:10,965 --> 00:43:11,925
Weren't you humiliated enough

571
00:43:12,133 --> 00:43:14,010
to go crawling back
into your hole?

572
00:43:14,135 --> 00:43:16,137
Where is it?
India, right?

573
00:43:18,556 --> 00:43:19,432
Hey, you did well today, Aash.

574
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:21,059
Come on, we should wash
it down with a few drinks.

575
00:43:21,184 --> 00:43:22,435
No, I'm all right, thanks.

576
00:43:22,602 --> 00:43:24,813
What are you doing?
- I'm going for a drink.

577
00:43:24,938 --> 00:43:25,772
Is that right?

578
00:43:25,939 --> 00:43:28,274
With these losers?
- They're not losers, Henry.

579
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,360
You got to be kidding me.
- No, I am not kidding you.

580
00:43:30,527 --> 00:43:32,237
Come on, we should go..
- Get off me!

581
00:43:32,404 --> 00:43:33,905
What are you doing?

582
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,660
You going to fight me?

583
00:43:39,744 --> 00:43:41,454
She doesn't want to go
with you, man.

584
00:43:41,996 --> 00:43:43,456
Just lay off, yeah!

585
00:43:44,582 --> 00:43:46,084
What did you just say?

586
00:43:46,376 --> 00:43:47,585
Come on.
- What did you just say?

587
00:43:47,752 --> 00:43:49,671
He asked you to lay off her.

588
00:43:51,589 --> 00:43:53,383
You piece of filth, you Indian.

589
00:43:53,591 --> 00:43:55,510
Looks like you didn't
get it the first time.

590
00:43:55,719 --> 00:43:57,053
How many times do
you want to get beaten

591
00:43:57,220 --> 00:43:59,180
before you understand
you're a loser?

592
00:44:02,934 --> 00:44:04,102
Just because you won
the other day

593
00:44:04,269 --> 00:44:06,021
doesn't mean you're
a better dancer, man.

594
00:44:09,482 --> 00:44:11,026
Come on.

595
00:44:11,317 --> 00:44:12,694
You challenging me?

596
00:44:14,154 --> 00:44:15,572
What were you thinking, man?

597
00:44:16,072 --> 00:44:18,575
You two bit cabbies are going
to beat Ceaser's group?

598
00:44:19,075 --> 00:44:21,661
I'm going to give you 10
seconds to get out of here

599
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:23,663
or meet me in the ring.

600
00:44:24,998 --> 00:44:27,459
Aarav, come on.
Aarav. Let's just go.

601
00:44:27,792 --> 00:44:29,377
Let's go. Just forget him.

602
00:44:29,544 --> 00:44:31,046
Come on. Let's just go.

603
00:44:34,632 --> 00:44:37,385
Please. - Last time, I blasted
your face into the wall.

604
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:40,138
This time I'm going to grind
your nose into the dirt.

605
00:44:43,516 --> 00:44:44,851
This is going to be fun.

606
00:45:02,911 --> 00:45:03,536
Well, any ideas?

607
00:45:03,703 --> 00:45:06,373
I've been trying to talk him
out of it since morning.

608
00:45:06,498 --> 00:45:09,417
What do you think?
Did Henry take it seriously?

609
00:45:09,626 --> 00:45:11,586
Why won't he take it seriously?

610
00:45:11,753 --> 00:45:13,171
He should.

611
00:45:13,588 --> 00:45:15,256
He should know.. That Ceaser

612
00:45:15,423 --> 00:45:16,966
that dance is no one's property.

613
00:45:17,092 --> 00:45:19,344
It's Henry, not Ceasar.
- What's the difference?

614
00:45:19,511 --> 00:45:21,179
What is in the name?
- Aarav.

615
00:45:22,972 --> 00:45:24,307
Hey!

616
00:45:24,766 --> 00:45:27,435
Aarav, I need to speak to you.

617
00:45:28,436 --> 00:45:29,437
Alone.

618
00:45:29,896 --> 00:45:31,314
You can speak here.

619
00:45:31,981 --> 00:45:33,191
Okay.

620
00:45:35,276 --> 00:45:37,362
Well, are you really
going to do this?

621
00:45:37,904 --> 00:45:39,114
Because I can go
and speak to Henry

622
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,366
and I can settle all of this.

623
00:45:41,491 --> 00:45:43,159
She's right, Aarav.
- What right?

624
00:45:43,326 --> 00:45:44,494
She's asking us to apologize.

625
00:45:44,619 --> 00:45:45,995
Are we going
to apologize to him?

626
00:45:46,121 --> 00:45:47,414
This is why
I call you a coward.

627
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:48,873
Aarav, don't listen to him.

628
00:45:48,998 --> 00:45:50,917
I'm not actually
speaking to you.

629
00:45:51,084 --> 00:45:54,587
Aarav, there's still time.
Let's go and apologize.

630
00:45:54,713 --> 00:45:57,465
But Aarav's here.
Why do you worry?

631
00:45:57,632 --> 00:45:59,467
You really don't
get it at all, do you?

632
00:45:59,634 --> 00:46:01,344
Teaching a few steps is easy

633
00:46:01,511 --> 00:46:02,971
but defeating Ceaser's
group is not.

634
00:46:03,138 --> 00:46:03,930
Who's talking to you?

635
00:46:04,055 --> 00:46:06,016
Aarav, you did the right thing.

636
00:46:06,182 --> 00:46:07,308
GG will support you.

637
00:46:07,475 --> 00:46:09,227
GG will organize
everything for you.

638
00:46:09,394 --> 00:46:11,604
Are you seriously still talking?

639
00:46:12,272 --> 00:46:14,858
What exactly are you
going to organize? Huh?

640
00:46:15,066 --> 00:46:17,402
Do you even know that
it takes seven dancers

641
00:46:17,527 --> 00:46:18,987
to do a dance off? Do you
know that?- I don't know.

642
00:46:19,154 --> 00:46:20,947
I don't know anything about
the dance. - Then.

643
00:46:21,114 --> 00:46:23,950
But I know Aarav.
And Aarav knows everything.

644
00:46:24,117 --> 00:46:25,910
We'll hold auditions,
do anything.

645
00:46:26,077 --> 00:46:28,413
But we won't apologize.
- It's not that easy, okay?

646
00:46:28,538 --> 00:46:30,457
Even if you get the dancers,
you're not

647
00:46:30,623 --> 00:46:32,000
going to be able to beat them.
All right?

648
00:46:32,167 --> 00:46:34,044
Trust me.
I'm in that crew, I know them.

649
00:46:34,252 --> 00:46:35,337
Oh, really?
- Yes.

650
00:46:35,503 --> 00:46:38,006
Then what are you doing here?
Sympathizing with us? - Wha..

651
00:46:38,131 --> 00:46:40,675
Go back to your team.
- Why don't you just shut your..

652
00:46:40,842 --> 00:46:43,678
Do everyone a favor
and just shut up.

653
00:46:45,013 --> 00:46:46,348
..shut up..
- Quiet!

654
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:48,183
What do I do?

655
00:46:48,808 --> 00:46:50,101
Say sorry?

656
00:46:50,935 --> 00:46:51,978
Apologize?

657
00:46:52,395 --> 00:46:53,480
Enough!

658
00:46:54,647 --> 00:46:55,857
I won't step back now.

659
00:46:55,982 --> 00:46:59,486
Aarav, we need seven dancers
for the dance off.

660
00:47:00,070 --> 00:47:01,071
Six!

661
00:47:02,572 --> 00:47:04,657
You really going to do this?

662
00:47:05,658 --> 00:47:07,744
Yes.
That's more like it.

663
00:47:07,952 --> 00:47:09,746
Just watch,
we'll hold auditions.

664
00:47:09,913 --> 00:47:12,665
I'll gather around
every Asian in Sheffield.

665
00:47:12,791 --> 00:47:14,084
You can choose.

666
00:47:14,834 --> 00:47:16,753
She left.
- Let her go.

667
00:47:18,338 --> 00:47:20,924
We'll make a crew,
with or without anyone.

668
00:47:21,049 --> 00:47:22,092
Yes!

669
00:47:22,217 --> 00:47:24,386
First Asian Crew.

670
00:47:24,594 --> 00:47:26,971
And GG will be the manager. Yes!

671
00:47:27,097 --> 00:47:30,934
Dipen, why don't you
say something? - Coward.

672
00:47:31,142 --> 00:47:32,894
There's no harm in trying.

673
00:47:34,145 --> 00:47:35,230
See.

674
00:47:54,791 --> 00:47:55,959
Yes, come in.

675
00:47:56,376 --> 00:47:57,752
Hi, my name is Zara.

676
00:47:57,919 --> 00:47:59,879
I've been dancing ever
since I was 5 years old.

677
00:48:00,046 --> 00:48:01,923
I love it and it's
the only thing I want to do.

678
00:48:02,090 --> 00:48:04,759
"It's beating hard."

679
00:48:05,010 --> 00:48:07,595
"My heart's getting scared.

680
00:48:07,762 --> 00:48:09,556
Yeah, I am Reddy
and I am looking for a dance.

681
00:48:09,723 --> 00:48:10,890
And I am interested
in doing dance.

682
00:48:11,016 --> 00:48:14,894
"Hey Ganpat! Bring some liquor."

683
00:48:15,061 --> 00:48:17,731
Next. - I just want
to show the Britishers

684
00:48:17,897 --> 00:48:19,691
that Asian people
can actually dance.

685
00:48:19,858 --> 00:48:22,318
"I'm a street dancer."

686
00:48:23,194 --> 00:48:25,196
"I'm a street dancer."
- Okay.

687
00:48:25,363 --> 00:48:26,322
Good!

688
00:48:26,489 --> 00:48:29,951
"You are a lover,
I am a lover."

689
00:48:30,076 --> 00:48:36,041
"You agree and I agree too."

690
00:48:43,381 --> 00:48:44,591
Come on, get started.

691
00:49:01,733 --> 00:49:03,318
He's great, Aarav.

692
00:49:04,277 --> 00:49:05,403
Good.

693
00:49:05,487 --> 00:49:06,571
Take down his details.

694
00:49:22,128 --> 00:49:25,715
"Sing along, oh heart."

695
00:49:25,924 --> 00:49:26,675
"Sing with joy.."

696
00:49:26,841 --> 00:49:32,555
"Your corset is
so body clinging."

697
00:49:32,764 --> 00:49:35,141
"When I unbutton it.."

698
00:49:35,266 --> 00:49:38,269
"I am terror.."

699
00:49:38,436 --> 00:49:39,896
I am going.
- Wait.

700
00:49:40,063 --> 00:49:41,773
He's so fantastic, look.

701
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:43,942
Look, he's fantastic.
- He's such a bore.

702
00:49:54,369 --> 00:49:57,080
"The king is here, oh people!"

703
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:58,665
Where did you learn this dance?

704
00:49:58,832 --> 00:49:59,582
From where..

705
00:49:59,708 --> 00:50:01,167
Next!
- Look, Aarav.

706
00:50:01,334 --> 00:50:02,877
Sheffield's very
own Michael Jackson.

707
00:50:03,044 --> 00:50:05,714
Come on, dance.
He was dancing really well.

708
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:06,589
Let's go.

709
00:50:06,756 --> 00:50:08,758
Can I seek Salim's permission?

710
00:50:09,342 --> 00:50:13,054
Do you even pee with
Salim's permission?

711
00:50:13,221 --> 00:50:15,306
You were dancing so well
outside. Come on, dance.

712
00:50:20,770 --> 00:50:21,938
He can dance too.

713
00:50:27,152 --> 00:50:28,319
Amit!

714
00:50:28,778 --> 00:50:30,280
"Yeah, right"

715
00:50:33,116 --> 00:50:37,579
"Here is the sweet maker.
Here he is."

716
00:50:39,914 --> 00:50:40,749
Aarav.

717
00:50:40,915 --> 00:50:41,791
Hey, Aarav.

718
00:50:41,958 --> 00:50:43,501
Good morning.
- Good morning.

719
00:50:43,668 --> 00:50:45,045
Did you bring
the admission form?

720
00:50:47,422 --> 00:50:48,673
I forgot.

721
00:50:49,257 --> 00:50:51,551
I'll get it tomorrow.
100 percent.

722
00:50:51,676 --> 00:50:52,802
Deal?
- Deal.

723
00:51:08,193 --> 00:51:11,488
"Spend time with me,
you will have a blast."

724
00:51:11,613 --> 00:51:14,449
"You will have all
the fun in life.."

725
00:51:14,657 --> 00:51:15,784
Let's go home.

726
00:51:17,952 --> 00:51:18,870
Hello.

727
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:21,664
Hello.

728
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:23,083
Hello.

729
00:51:23,458 --> 00:51:24,584
You must dance.

730
00:51:52,862 --> 00:51:55,699
We need two more dancers.
Where will we find them?

731
00:51:55,865 --> 00:51:59,202
I warned you before.
But no one listens to me.

732
00:52:02,956 --> 00:52:05,834
There's still time.
Let's cancel it.

733
00:52:07,293 --> 00:52:08,837
Make an Asian crew?

734
00:52:10,255 --> 00:52:11,840
Is it a piece of cake?

735
00:52:14,009 --> 00:52:17,053
Finding a dancer
isn't that easy.

736
00:52:17,679 --> 00:52:20,348
And who would want
to lock horns with Ceaser?

737
00:52:22,892 --> 00:52:24,728
Aarav, you know..

738
00:52:25,895 --> 00:52:27,647
6th member.
- No!

739
00:52:28,565 --> 00:52:31,317
No. No. No.
No way, man.

740
00:52:31,735 --> 00:52:33,236
Hey, come on..

741
00:52:41,244 --> 00:52:43,455
What are you doing?
Concentrate.

742
00:52:45,665 --> 00:52:47,917
This is the big
Asian Crew, is it?

743
00:52:51,629 --> 00:52:54,174
Look at you guys
sweating out like pigs.

744
00:52:57,177 --> 00:52:59,262
You won't even last
a few minutes in there.

745
00:53:00,096 --> 00:53:01,931
You know, it's only
two weeks to go.

746
00:53:02,766 --> 00:53:04,768
Make sure you turn up
for the battle.

747
00:53:07,937 --> 00:53:10,774
Oh and in case you don't know.

748
00:53:11,191 --> 00:53:13,860
It takes seven people
for a dance off.

749
00:53:14,402 --> 00:53:15,528
I know.

750
00:53:15,987 --> 00:53:17,822
But can I only see six?

751
00:53:18,531 --> 00:53:20,658
Unless you want
this clown to dance.

752
00:53:24,913 --> 00:53:26,748
Maybe you need to
count that again, Henry.

753
00:53:28,833 --> 00:53:30,001
Excuse me.

754
00:53:30,627 --> 00:53:32,253
Serves you seven of us.

755
00:53:33,088 --> 00:53:34,047
Bye!

756
00:53:44,474 --> 00:53:46,267
That's how I made my crew.

757
00:53:46,810 --> 00:53:48,895
Sheffield's first Asian crew.

758
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:50,355
My crew.

759
00:53:50,563 --> 00:53:53,942
Aashira, Dan, Amit,
Amy, Mike, Atul, GG.

760
00:53:54,484 --> 00:53:55,944
And behind the camera, Dipen.

761
00:53:57,362 --> 00:54:00,490
I had got another opportunity
to prove myself to Ceaser.

762
00:54:01,324 --> 00:54:02,575
And to show him

763
00:54:02,701 --> 00:54:04,577
that I was good enough
to join his crew.

764
00:54:05,078 --> 00:54:07,455
And I didn't want
to lose at any cost.

765
00:54:07,872 --> 00:54:10,542
So, we started rehearsing

766
00:54:10,834 --> 00:54:12,043
day and night.

767
00:54:12,669 --> 00:54:14,421
There was just one problem.

768
00:54:15,088 --> 00:54:17,549
This dance off wasn't
as important for my crew

769
00:54:17,757 --> 00:54:19,175
as it was for me.

770
00:54:24,097 --> 00:54:25,890
Winning was everything for me.

771
00:54:27,183 --> 00:54:29,060
And I couldn't see
anything beyond that.

772
00:54:30,395 --> 00:54:32,022
So did I get frustrated?

773
00:54:32,897 --> 00:54:34,107
Of course, I did.

774
00:54:35,734 --> 00:54:36,693
Where were you?

775
00:54:37,819 --> 00:54:38,695
What?

776
00:54:48,163 --> 00:54:50,623
Training everyone
together wasn't easy.

777
00:54:51,666 --> 00:54:53,376
But we didn't have an option.

778
00:54:54,169 --> 00:54:55,211
I had to get them ready.

779
00:54:55,337 --> 00:54:57,172
One, two, and three, four..

780
00:54:57,339 --> 00:54:58,715
What are you doing?

781
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:01,259
Once more.
One, two and three..

782
00:55:02,344 --> 00:55:04,888
It's okay.
- It's not okay.

783
00:55:05,722 --> 00:55:06,765
Aarav.

784
00:55:25,450 --> 00:55:26,785
Uncle, the kitchen's locked up.

785
00:55:26,910 --> 00:55:28,536
And I've closed everything
in the backyard.

786
00:55:29,954 --> 00:55:30,872
Great.

787
00:55:32,123 --> 00:55:33,667
Uncle, I need money.

788
00:55:35,085 --> 00:55:36,503
Did you get a girlfriend?

789
00:55:41,883 --> 00:55:44,010
Not this, uncle.
I wanted my salary.

790
00:55:44,219 --> 00:55:47,263
Your salary gets
deposited in the account.

791
00:55:47,430 --> 00:55:48,390
You know that.

792
00:55:48,556 --> 00:55:49,974
Actually,
next week is the final date

793
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:51,476
to fill-in the
University application.

794
00:55:51,768 --> 00:55:53,228
And I've to pay
the fees as well.

795
00:55:53,561 --> 00:55:55,021
So I needed money
from the account.

796
00:55:55,146 --> 00:55:57,065
What will you do at college?

797
00:55:57,524 --> 00:55:59,025
And what will you do
after you pass out?

798
00:55:59,192 --> 00:56:01,569
Get a job?
You're already doing that.

799
00:56:01,695 --> 00:56:04,114
Uncle, I want to do an MBA.

800
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:07,826
I came here for studies, right?
You won't have to spend a dime.

801
00:56:07,951 --> 00:56:11,663
Just give me my salary,
I'll pay the fee.

802
00:56:11,830 --> 00:56:13,164
Your salary?

803
00:56:14,833 --> 00:56:16,292
What salary?

804
00:56:18,003 --> 00:56:20,255
Who paid for your ticket
to come here?

805
00:56:21,214 --> 00:56:22,257
I did.

806
00:56:22,632 --> 00:56:24,050
Who's managing all
your expenses here?

807
00:56:24,217 --> 00:56:25,260
I am.

808
00:56:26,261 --> 00:56:28,221
Do you think
I'm feeding you for free?

809
00:56:29,472 --> 00:56:31,099
I don't owe you a single penny.

810
00:56:31,307 --> 00:56:32,934
In fact,
if you check the accounts

811
00:56:33,101 --> 00:56:34,644
you owe me instead.

812
00:56:35,603 --> 00:56:36,771
He talks nonsense.

813
00:56:37,022 --> 00:56:38,648
Uncle, I've been working
here for 10 months.

814
00:56:38,815 --> 00:56:39,733
I've been doing 3 shifts.

815
00:56:39,899 --> 00:56:41,026
Had I been working
somewhere else

816
00:56:41,151 --> 00:56:42,861
I would've made
a lot of money by now.

817
00:56:47,699 --> 00:56:48,950
Go, find some other job.

818
00:56:49,075 --> 00:56:51,202
Sorry, uncle. I'll miss my date.

819
00:56:51,327 --> 00:56:54,080
Go, go. Don't waste time.

820
00:56:54,247 --> 00:56:55,331
Search work.

821
00:56:55,457 --> 00:56:58,001
Please, sorry.
- Get lost!

822
00:57:23,276 --> 00:57:26,112
What do you want?
- Don't you get it?

823
00:57:26,279 --> 00:57:27,864
Don't ruin Amit's career,
like you ruined yours.

824
00:57:27,989 --> 00:57:30,200
If he doesn't attend college his
attendance won't be complete.

825
00:57:30,325 --> 00:57:32,118
He'll get suspended.
He won't find a job.

826
00:57:32,285 --> 00:57:34,079
Salim, why don't
you just get lost? Yeah!

827
00:57:34,245 --> 00:57:35,455
Amit knows what's best for him.

828
00:57:35,622 --> 00:57:37,582
If he did,
he wouldn't have been here.

829
00:57:37,749 --> 00:57:39,376
He's here because he
wants to be here.. - No!

830
00:57:39,417 --> 00:57:41,670
He's here because he's stupid.

831
00:57:41,836 --> 00:57:43,546
He's lost his mind
like all of you.

832
00:57:45,465 --> 00:57:46,925
Aarav, you know what?

833
00:57:47,092 --> 00:57:48,551
Let's talk to Amit once.

834
00:57:48,677 --> 00:57:50,470
We should just let him leave
if he wants to.

835
00:57:50,637 --> 00:57:51,846
Aashira, please.

836
00:57:52,347 --> 00:57:53,890
No one tells me
how to handle my crew.

837
00:57:54,015 --> 00:57:55,392
We have just one week left.

838
00:57:55,558 --> 00:57:57,435
And I don't want
to lose at any cost.

839
00:57:57,644 --> 00:57:59,104
Do you understand that?

840
00:58:00,021 --> 00:58:01,398
Do you all understand that?

841
00:58:02,816 --> 00:58:04,609
Will you get back
to work please?

842
00:58:09,989 --> 00:58:11,282
Aarav.
- What?

843
00:58:11,741 --> 00:58:13,451
There's a problem.
- What problem?

844
00:58:14,035 --> 00:58:15,495
Solve your problems yourself.

845
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:18,039
Problem.

846
00:58:29,259 --> 00:58:30,552
Why hasn't Amit arrived yet?

847
00:58:31,511 --> 00:58:32,929
He'll be here.

848
00:58:35,223 --> 00:58:37,392
An hour late one day
before the dance off.

849
00:58:37,517 --> 00:58:39,310
Are you all here on a picnic?

850
00:58:41,062 --> 00:58:43,815
Chill, buddy.
Let's wait for him.

851
00:58:47,902 --> 00:58:50,155
No. Come on.

852
00:58:53,158 --> 00:58:54,200
Come on!

853
00:58:55,785 --> 00:58:56,703
Aarav.

854
00:58:59,414 --> 00:59:02,292
Come on.
Why are you getting hyper?

855
00:59:02,459 --> 00:59:05,295
We'll practice.
All of us will get it, yeah?

856
00:59:05,462 --> 00:59:07,464
It's not such a big deal, okay?

857
00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:08,840
It's not a big deal?

858
00:59:09,257 --> 00:59:10,550
It's not a big deal?

859
00:59:11,092 --> 00:59:13,094
This is why I came here,
Aashira.

860
00:59:13,595 --> 00:59:15,430
This is why
I lied to my parents.

861
00:59:15,555 --> 00:59:17,640
It might be just a dance off
for you, not for me.

862
00:59:17,807 --> 00:59:20,435
Everything will be fine, Aarav.
Relax.

863
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:21,644
Relax?

864
00:59:22,312 --> 00:59:24,439
I can't relax, do you know why?

865
00:59:24,939 --> 00:59:26,858
Because I don't have
my parent's wealth to back me.

866
00:59:27,025 --> 00:59:29,152
I don't have
ancestral riches like you.

867
00:59:29,319 --> 00:59:31,029
I have to fight my own battles.

868
00:59:31,446 --> 00:59:33,031
This dance off means
everything to me.

869
00:59:33,198 --> 00:59:35,283
What do you mean?

870
00:59:36,201 --> 00:59:39,371
I mean.. Am I not
contributing into this?

871
00:59:39,496 --> 00:59:40,830
What did you contribute?

872
00:59:41,498 --> 00:59:43,750
What did you do other
than running behind Amy?

873
00:59:43,917 --> 00:59:45,377
Aarav.
- What?

874
00:59:45,710 --> 00:59:47,712
No, Aashira, let it be.

875
00:59:50,590 --> 00:59:51,716
He's right.

876
00:59:53,009 --> 00:59:54,969
He doesn't need GG.

877
01:00:21,830 --> 01:00:24,541
Before you say sorry,
I forgive you!

878
01:00:30,588 --> 01:00:33,008
Don't worry. We can do this.

879
01:00:33,216 --> 01:00:34,092
Understand?

880
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:35,010
Don't worry.
- Aarav.

881
01:00:35,176 --> 01:00:36,052
Just stick..

882
01:00:36,469 --> 01:00:37,512
Aarav, wait.

883
01:00:39,764 --> 01:00:42,225
I wish you all the best.
- Thank you.

884
01:00:42,392 --> 01:00:44,519
You're not coming?
- Why?

885
01:00:44,978 --> 01:00:47,355
Because I know
what's going to happen!

886
01:00:49,107 --> 01:00:50,358
Idiot!

887
01:01:00,493 --> 01:01:02,454
"I know, my step for"

888
01:01:02,662 --> 01:01:04,247
"I like to return to the class."

889
01:01:04,414 --> 01:01:06,666
"Beat boys!
Bring it down like this!"

890
01:03:51,164 --> 01:03:53,583
You did good,
but it's not enough, is it?

891
01:03:54,250 --> 01:03:57,671
There's a huge difference
between the good and the best.

892
01:03:58,171 --> 01:03:59,714
There's just one winner.

893
01:03:59,881 --> 01:04:03,218
Unfortunately, everybody else
after that is a loser.

894
01:04:19,401 --> 01:04:20,777
Sorry, Aarav.

895
01:04:23,988 --> 01:04:26,116
We should've practiced more.

896
01:04:27,951 --> 01:04:31,663
I told you, I can't do this.

897
01:04:31,955 --> 01:04:33,373
Forget it.

898
01:04:48,555 --> 01:04:49,514
Hello.

899
01:04:50,306 --> 01:04:51,349
What?

900
01:04:51,474 --> 01:04:52,434
Loser.

901
01:04:53,059 --> 01:04:56,730
I understood what it meant
after that phone call.

902
01:04:58,023 --> 01:04:59,566
Ceaser was right.

903
01:04:59,941 --> 01:05:01,276
I was a loser.

904
01:05:20,795 --> 01:05:23,048
He's critical.
We'll just have to wait.

905
01:05:28,887 --> 01:05:33,975
"What's this punishment?"

906
01:05:35,602 --> 01:05:40,565
"What's this mistake
You have made?"

907
01:05:41,649 --> 01:05:46,613
"My destiny's upset with me."

908
01:05:46,780 --> 01:05:48,156
Solve your problems yourself.

909
01:05:48,281 --> 01:05:53,995
"Why are my dreams
separate from me?"

910
01:05:55,163 --> 01:05:59,709
"Where are You, God?"

911
01:06:01,753 --> 01:06:06,466
"Tell me where You are?"

912
01:06:17,811 --> 01:06:18,937
I'll be the first
from Baleshwar

913
01:06:19,104 --> 01:06:20,397
to get a foreign degree.

914
01:06:21,648 --> 01:06:24,109
Forget the form.
- It will shut in 10 minutes.

915
01:06:40,834 --> 01:06:45,880
"Neither pain nor happiness
will last forever."

916
01:06:47,257 --> 01:06:52,929
"Who will fill this rift?"

917
01:06:53,805 --> 01:06:59,561
"Why are you quiet now?"

918
01:07:00,186 --> 01:07:06,067
"Even my soul's
separated from me."

919
01:07:07,193 --> 01:07:13,324
"Why was my prayer unanswered?"

920
01:07:14,117 --> 01:07:19,622
"Where are You, God?"

921
01:07:20,749 --> 01:07:22,917
"Where are.."

922
01:07:23,043 --> 01:07:25,003
I was so obsessed with myself

923
01:07:25,462 --> 01:07:27,213
that I forgot all
about my friends.

924
01:07:28,006 --> 01:07:29,382
I forgot Dipen.

925
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:31,801
It was my fault.

926
01:07:32,594 --> 01:07:34,429
I should've never gone
to Sheffield.

927
01:07:34,596 --> 01:07:38,433
"Tell me where You are?"
- Here.

928
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:39,726
Thank you.

929
01:07:43,313 --> 01:07:45,607
Oh! They have come.
They are here.

930
01:07:51,196 --> 01:07:54,115
Hi! Welcome home.

931
01:07:56,201 --> 01:07:58,411
The doctors advised him
two weeks of rest.

932
01:07:58,536 --> 01:08:02,457
Rest is fine, but don't think
you're off the hook.

933
01:08:03,041 --> 01:08:04,292
Let the doctor fix you first

934
01:08:04,459 --> 01:08:06,211
then we'll fix you
up separately.

935
01:08:06,378 --> 01:08:07,462
Come on.

936
01:08:11,299 --> 01:08:14,302
Take care of him.
Don't leave him alone.

937
01:08:18,139 --> 01:08:19,099
Come.

938
01:08:19,265 --> 01:08:21,559
You go, I'll come.
- You sure?

939
01:08:21,685 --> 01:08:22,644
Yeah.

940
01:08:35,782 --> 01:08:37,409
I won. Four.

941
01:08:37,534 --> 01:08:39,994
Look. - Salim,
what are you doing here?

942
01:08:44,082 --> 01:08:46,334
How are you, Dipen?
- I'm okay.

943
01:08:46,459 --> 01:08:49,212
Don't worry, brother,
everything will be fine now.

944
01:08:49,921 --> 01:08:53,466
If I had any clue,
this would've never happened.

945
01:08:54,426 --> 01:08:55,677
You don't worry.

946
01:08:55,802 --> 01:08:56,720
One month!

947
01:08:56,886 --> 01:09:00,432
I'll get you admitted
to the University in a month.

948
01:09:00,598 --> 01:09:02,517
Money? My responsibility.

949
01:09:03,351 --> 01:09:05,478
You're in the wrong company.

950
01:09:05,854 --> 01:09:07,772
Had you been with
the right people

951
01:09:09,107 --> 01:09:10,734
this would have never happened.

952
01:09:13,945 --> 01:09:17,282
Get well soon.
That's all I wanted to say.

953
01:09:23,830 --> 01:09:25,206
Idiot!

954
01:09:27,834 --> 01:09:29,627
Don't worry, Dipen.

955
01:09:29,794 --> 01:09:31,713
I'll get you admitted.

956
01:09:32,088 --> 01:09:35,050
And then,
I'll also get you a job.

957
01:09:35,467 --> 01:09:37,969
I'll also get you married.

958
01:09:38,345 --> 01:09:41,598
And after that, I'll help
you beget children too.

959
01:10:05,246 --> 01:10:06,748
What's the matter, Aarav?

960
01:10:08,333 --> 01:10:09,376
Tell me.

961
01:10:10,126 --> 01:10:11,503
Salim's right, you know.

962
01:10:14,255 --> 01:10:16,007
None of us bothered.

963
01:10:17,175 --> 01:10:18,593
I never did.

964
01:10:20,470 --> 01:10:22,681
I am a selfish person.
- No, you're not.

965
01:10:24,057 --> 01:10:25,183
I am.

966
01:10:26,059 --> 01:10:27,769
I only think about myself.

967
01:10:29,062 --> 01:10:30,897
I need to set that right now.

968
01:10:32,691 --> 01:10:35,026
Look, Aarav, first of all

969
01:10:35,151 --> 01:10:37,028
don't take Salim seriously.

970
01:10:37,195 --> 01:10:38,738
You know what he's like, yeah?

971
01:10:39,447 --> 01:10:43,410
And Aarav, you're not
a selfish person, okay?

972
01:10:43,618 --> 01:10:45,453
I mean, just the fact
that you're feeling like this

973
01:10:45,620 --> 01:10:47,789
it means that you care. Yeah?

974
01:10:50,041 --> 01:10:52,460
We'll have to do something about
Dipen's admission, Aashira.

975
01:10:53,169 --> 01:10:55,588
He has to get in this semester.
- Yeah!

976
01:10:59,467 --> 01:11:01,261
Hey! You okay?

977
01:11:04,347 --> 01:11:05,849
Mom's sent food.

978
01:11:08,768 --> 01:11:10,061
Where's everyone?

979
01:11:10,895 --> 01:11:12,313
Must be in the room.

980
01:11:13,023 --> 01:11:14,858
Dipen! GG! Atul!

981
01:11:15,567 --> 01:11:17,986
You sure you're okay?
- Yeah.

982
01:11:20,196 --> 01:11:21,614
Wow! Food.

983
01:11:22,449 --> 01:11:24,075
Yup, strict orders from mom

984
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:25,702
nothing should get wasted.

985
01:11:25,869 --> 01:11:27,203
I am right here.

986
01:11:28,246 --> 01:11:29,664
Where's Dipen?

987
01:11:31,082 --> 01:11:32,417
Must be in the room.

988
01:11:33,752 --> 01:11:34,961
I'll go check.

989
01:11:49,142 --> 01:11:51,311
He isn't.
- You checked?

990
01:12:05,367 --> 01:12:07,619
Have you lost your mind?
Where were you?

991
01:12:07,744 --> 01:12:08,828
What happened?

992
01:12:09,329 --> 01:12:10,705
You should've told us.

993
01:12:10,830 --> 01:12:12,374
I just went for a walk.

994
01:12:13,333 --> 01:12:16,586
It's okay, come let's eat.
- I am not hungry.

995
01:12:17,253 --> 01:12:18,505
Thanks.

996
01:12:21,549 --> 01:12:22,926
I was scared.

997
01:12:23,426 --> 01:12:25,011
I thought he was again..

998
01:12:28,973 --> 01:12:30,308
This won't do.

999
01:12:31,893 --> 01:12:33,895
We'll have to do something
about his admission.

1000
01:12:36,189 --> 01:12:37,399
Okay, look.

1001
01:12:37,565 --> 01:12:40,026
This might be a
bit of a crazy idea.

1002
01:12:40,151 --> 01:12:41,653
But there's one way.

1003
01:12:43,571 --> 01:12:44,906
'The Boyz!'

1004
01:12:47,409 --> 01:12:49,077
'National Dance-Off
Competition.'

1005
01:12:49,244 --> 01:12:51,246
'1st price 10,000 Pounds?'

1006
01:12:51,413 --> 01:12:53,373
'2nd price 5,000 Pounds?'

1007
01:12:54,916 --> 01:12:56,042
No. No, man.

1008
01:12:56,209 --> 01:12:58,128
That's not happening.
- Listen to me.

1009
01:12:58,294 --> 01:12:59,504
You don't have to beat
them, man!

1010
01:12:59,629 --> 01:13:01,631
Even if we come second,
we'll win 5,000 Pounds.

1011
01:13:01,798 --> 01:13:03,508
Dipen's fee for a year.

1012
01:13:07,595 --> 01:13:10,598
What did you say?
- Even if we come second?

1013
01:13:28,033 --> 01:13:29,451
"Say yes."

1014
01:13:29,617 --> 01:13:30,994
"Say yes."

1015
01:13:31,119 --> 01:13:32,328
"Say yes."

1016
01:13:32,495 --> 01:13:33,997
"Say yes."

1017
01:13:34,164 --> 01:13:35,457
"Say yes."

1018
01:13:35,623 --> 01:13:37,000
"Say yes."

1019
01:13:37,167 --> 01:13:38,585
"Say yes."

1020
01:13:38,752 --> 01:13:40,420
"Say yes."

1021
01:13:47,844 --> 01:13:50,847
"Let us all get together,
get together, right now."

1022
01:13:56,978 --> 01:13:58,813
"In the balcony and
in the park.."

1023
01:13:59,856 --> 01:14:00,815
Pizza!

1024
01:14:02,984 --> 01:14:06,112
"Let us all get together,
get together, right now."

1025
01:14:12,077 --> 01:14:13,870
Five, six, seven, eight..

1026
01:14:14,037 --> 01:14:16,706
One, two, three, four..

1027
01:14:45,110 --> 01:14:46,361
"Yeah!"

1028
01:14:46,736 --> 01:14:49,656
"Come on, I mean..
Let's hear the beat. Yo!"

1029
01:14:50,782 --> 01:14:52,325
"Come on, yo!"

1030
01:14:53,326 --> 01:14:55,078
"Body, rock yours.."

1031
01:15:39,080 --> 01:15:40,040
Fill it!

1032
01:15:53,595 --> 01:15:55,096
Hi, mum.
- Hello.

1033
01:15:55,221 --> 01:15:56,014
What are you doing?

1034
01:15:56,181 --> 01:15:57,307
Hello, ma'am.
- How are you, son?

1035
01:15:57,474 --> 01:15:59,851
Oh my God. What is that?
Salim's, right?

1036
01:16:00,935 --> 01:16:02,520
This is our Freddy.

1037
01:16:02,687 --> 01:16:04,689
Oh, wow!
His name is Freddy.

1038
01:16:04,856 --> 01:16:06,483
And she wouldn't sleep
without him. - Freddy?

1039
01:16:06,649 --> 01:16:07,609
Yeah, I know, mom.

1040
01:16:07,776 --> 01:16:09,778
That's you when you were
six months old.

1041
01:16:09,986 --> 01:16:12,489
Look. She still looks
the same, doesn't she?

1042
01:16:17,994 --> 01:16:19,496
I am going to bed.

1043
01:16:25,669 --> 01:16:28,046
See you, ma'am.
- Okay.

1044
01:16:55,907 --> 01:16:57,659
Are you okay?
- Yeah!

1045
01:16:58,326 --> 01:16:59,244
What happened?

1046
01:16:59,994 --> 01:17:01,079
Run! Run! Run!

1047
01:17:01,246 --> 01:17:02,706
We've been running
for two hours.

1048
01:17:02,831 --> 01:17:04,708
Off guys!
- What's this?

1049
01:17:04,874 --> 01:17:06,584
Does GG have to do all
the hard work? - No..

1050
01:17:06,751 --> 01:17:07,961
You come with me.

1051
01:17:09,504 --> 01:17:11,965
Where are we going?
- I'm taking you out.

1052
01:17:12,132 --> 01:17:13,425
We deserve a day off.

1053
01:17:32,193 --> 01:17:38,074
"Every moment with
you seems blissful."

1054
01:17:38,241 --> 01:17:43,705
"My heart sways and dances."

1055
01:17:44,247 --> 01:17:49,878
"Every time you speak
the world fades away."

1056
01:17:50,128 --> 01:17:55,800
"I can't sleep,
I stay awake all night."

1057
01:17:58,386 --> 01:18:00,263
"Beloved..."

1058
01:18:01,431 --> 01:18:08,229
"I have fallen in love,
save me."

1059
01:18:08,938 --> 01:18:14,361
"I have fallen in love.."

1060
01:18:16,821 --> 01:18:18,531
Can you do me a favor?
- Yes.

1061
01:18:18,698 --> 01:18:20,241
I am very thirsty.

1062
01:18:20,367 --> 01:18:22,327
Can you get me water, please?
- Yeah.

1063
01:18:22,494 --> 01:18:23,578
Please.

1064
01:18:23,745 --> 01:18:25,497
I'll just wait for you, yeah?
- Okay.

1065
01:18:28,917 --> 01:18:30,710
Darn!

1066
01:18:31,294 --> 01:18:34,714
I told you clean the shelf
and do it properly please.

1067
01:18:34,881 --> 01:18:36,216
Yes, what do you want?

1068
01:18:37,801 --> 01:18:41,012
Can I help you?
- Yes, just.. Can..

1069
01:18:44,474 --> 01:18:46,101
Help the customer, Cathy.

1070
01:18:46,226 --> 01:18:48,603
What are you doing?
Did you hear what I said?

1071
01:18:48,812 --> 01:18:51,940
Help the customer, darn it.
Can't do a thing right.

1072
01:18:52,065 --> 01:18:53,358
Stupid woman.

1073
01:18:53,900 --> 01:18:55,235
Good for nothing.

1074
01:18:56,736 --> 01:18:58,196
Can I help you?

1075
01:18:58,571 --> 01:18:59,989
What did you break now?

1076
01:19:00,156 --> 01:19:01,199
Nothing. Nothing.

1077
01:19:01,324 --> 01:19:02,951
Everything's fine.
Everything's fine.

1078
01:19:03,118 --> 01:19:05,370
You know me.
I.. I'll break your teeth.

1079
01:19:05,537 --> 01:19:08,915
No, no, I promise.
I promise. Everything's fine.

1080
01:19:10,959 --> 01:19:13,962
Thank you so much.
He would've killed me.

1081
01:19:17,716 --> 01:19:20,093
Anyway, what are you
looking for, darling?

1082
01:19:20,260 --> 01:19:22,470
Can I help you with something?
- "Swimming deep in darkness."

1083
01:19:22,595 --> 01:19:25,890
"I came to the surface
for air.."

1084
01:19:26,016 --> 01:19:27,392
You just did.

1085
01:19:28,143 --> 01:19:34,441
"And I've not gone back,
ever since that day."

1086
01:19:38,278 --> 01:19:44,659
"Since you sneaked into my soul,
life changed on the whole."

1087
01:19:44,826 --> 01:19:47,620
"It makes me want to sway."

1088
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:55,295
"I was on the road to nowhere,
you showed me the way."

1089
01:19:56,087 --> 01:20:01,468
"I want to dance and feel free,
maybe I should dare."

1090
01:20:01,968 --> 01:20:07,849
"Should I open these doors
and not be too scared?"

1091
01:20:08,099 --> 01:20:11,311
"Should I let you
in my heart would you"

1092
01:20:11,436 --> 01:20:13,646
"promise me you'll stay?"

1093
01:20:14,397 --> 01:20:16,816
"Promise me you'll stay."

1094
01:20:17,484 --> 01:20:19,235
"Promise me you'll stay."

1095
01:20:20,403 --> 01:20:21,905
"Promise me you'll stay."

1096
01:20:22,030 --> 01:20:25,325
"Swear on you, girl."

1097
01:20:37,921 --> 01:20:41,716
"My heart's been
keeping secrets."

1098
01:20:41,883 --> 01:20:44,678
"What's happening to me?"

1099
01:20:44,844 --> 01:20:49,599
"You dwell in my heart.
- Holy Lord!"

1100
01:20:49,766 --> 01:20:53,687
"Accept these sweet
nothings of love."

1101
01:20:53,853 --> 01:20:56,731
"I am the only one for you."

1102
01:20:56,898 --> 01:21:00,485
"And you're made for me."

1103
01:21:02,112 --> 01:21:05,073
"You dwell in my heart."

1104
01:21:05,240 --> 01:21:07,992
"You're everywhere I look."

1105
01:21:08,159 --> 01:21:10,995
"Listen to what
my heart has to say."

1106
01:21:11,162 --> 01:21:13,498
"Listen to it, girl."

1107
01:21:14,124 --> 01:21:19,629
"I can never stop
thinking about you."

1108
01:21:20,130 --> 01:21:26,177
"Just say it once
and I'll forsake the world."

1109
01:21:31,391 --> 01:21:38,023
"I have fallen in love,
save me."

1110
01:21:38,898 --> 01:21:44,571
"I have fallen in love.."

1111
01:21:44,904 --> 01:21:51,661
"I have fallen in love,
save me."

1112
01:21:52,454 --> 01:21:57,959
"I have fallen in love.."

1113
01:22:07,969 --> 01:22:08,887
Hi.

1114
01:22:13,099 --> 01:22:15,477
How much did you collect?
- 2,500.

1115
01:22:20,940 --> 01:22:24,402
Salim. I saw dad
today and his wife.

1116
01:22:25,862 --> 01:22:28,114
He's got a store at Edmund Road.

1117
01:22:29,449 --> 01:22:33,078
You know what? Everything
makes sense to me now.

1118
01:22:33,912 --> 01:22:38,583
I always thought mom
pretends to be happy.

1119
01:22:38,708 --> 01:22:41,294
But inside she was miserable.

1120
01:22:41,670 --> 01:22:45,048
But now I know she's
actually happy without dad.

1121
01:22:45,215 --> 01:22:47,300
I.. I just get
the whole thing now.

1122
01:22:48,802 --> 01:22:49,969
Salim.

1123
01:22:52,764 --> 01:22:55,016
There's nothing for us there.

1124
01:22:55,433 --> 01:22:57,811
I am actually he isn't here.

1125
01:22:57,977 --> 01:23:01,356
I know that I've been stupid
in the past.

1126
01:23:02,899 --> 01:23:03,733
But now I'm glad

1127
01:23:03,942 --> 01:23:05,944
it's just the
three of us in this house.

1128
01:23:06,111 --> 01:23:08,530
We're so much better off
without him.

1129
01:23:09,197 --> 01:23:10,824
He's not a good man.

1130
01:23:11,574 --> 01:23:13,952
He's really not the man
we thought he was.

1131
01:23:14,536 --> 01:23:16,037
Not at all.

1132
01:23:17,247 --> 01:23:21,543
Anyway, I just thought
I should tell you that.

1133
01:23:28,633 --> 01:23:30,552
But how did you find him?

1134
01:23:30,719 --> 01:23:33,263
I didn't. Aarav did.

1135
01:23:46,985 --> 01:23:49,112
Surprise!

1136
01:23:49,571 --> 01:23:50,655
Thanks, buddy.

1137
01:23:53,283 --> 01:23:54,784
Happy birthday.

1138
01:23:58,788 --> 01:24:00,707
I'll go change.
- Go on.

1139
01:24:02,584 --> 01:24:04,294
Come on, guys, drink time.

1140
01:24:04,794 --> 01:24:06,046
Wait.

1141
01:24:07,047 --> 01:24:09,215
Aarav.
- We have a date tonight.

1142
01:24:09,966 --> 01:24:11,509
I've to talk to you urgently.

1143
01:24:11,718 --> 01:24:14,471
No talking.
You're going to party.

1144
01:24:14,637 --> 01:24:16,431
Oh my! Why are you so happy?

1145
01:24:16,598 --> 01:24:18,266
It's my birthday.
- Your birthday?

1146
01:24:18,433 --> 01:24:20,143
How's the shirt?
- Very nice.

1147
01:24:20,852 --> 01:24:24,814
GG! GG! GG! GG!

1148
01:24:32,655 --> 01:24:35,784
I want to make a toast.

1149
01:24:37,577 --> 01:24:38,495
Thank you.

1150
01:24:38,661 --> 01:24:42,040
Hey, I meant,
I want to propose a toast.

1151
01:24:42,665 --> 01:24:44,417
To GG!

1152
01:24:47,212 --> 01:24:49,506
I want to thank all of you.

1153
01:24:50,256 --> 01:24:52,050
Especially, Aarav.

1154
01:24:53,426 --> 01:24:54,719
I love you.

1155
01:24:57,764 --> 01:24:59,099
Thank you, Aashira.

1156
01:25:00,266 --> 01:25:01,476
I love you.

1157
01:25:05,772 --> 01:25:07,065
Dipen..

1158
01:25:08,191 --> 01:25:09,693
We were alive!

1159
01:25:11,361 --> 01:25:12,946
Why didn't you tell us
you had a problem?

1160
01:25:13,071 --> 01:25:14,447
We were so hurt.

1161
01:25:14,614 --> 01:25:16,491
GG, forget it. Let it go.

1162
01:25:19,494 --> 01:25:20,954
And I want to say that

1163
01:25:21,996 --> 01:25:24,499
we're going to win
this dance off!

1164
01:25:24,666 --> 01:25:26,418
Yes!
- Yes!

1165
01:25:26,584 --> 01:25:29,212
"We're going to
do something fun."

1166
01:25:30,255 --> 01:25:32,882
"We'll all go crazy."

1167
01:25:33,883 --> 01:25:37,303
"We won't let you
sleep all night."

1168
01:25:37,637 --> 01:25:41,057
"We'll leave only
when the sun's up again."

1169
01:25:41,182 --> 01:25:44,644
"We're going to unite our
hearts affectionately."

1170
01:25:44,853 --> 01:25:48,314
"If the music volume drops,
we'll scream aloud."

1171
01:25:48,440 --> 01:25:52,068
"We're going to unite our
hearts affectionately."

1172
01:25:52,235 --> 01:25:55,905
"If the music volume drops,
we'll scream aloud."

1173
01:25:56,031 --> 01:25:57,782
"You're feeling sad, baby."

1174
01:25:57,949 --> 01:25:59,409
"You're feeling sad.

1175
01:25:59,784 --> 01:26:01,369
"You're feeling sad, girl."

1176
01:26:01,578 --> 01:26:02,746
"No feeling sad."

1177
01:26:02,871 --> 01:26:03,455
"Because.."

1178
01:26:03,663 --> 01:26:05,832
"Tonight's the party going mad."

1179
01:26:07,167 --> 01:26:09,461
"Tonight's the party going mad."

1180
01:26:10,962 --> 01:26:13,214
"Tonight's the party going mad."

1181
01:26:14,591 --> 01:26:18,053
"Tonight's the party going mad."

1182
01:26:19,846 --> 01:26:23,099
"We're going to
do something fun."

1183
01:26:23,892 --> 01:26:26,394
"We will all go crazy!"

1184
01:26:28,063 --> 01:26:29,356
Hey cornbread!

1185
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:42,952
It's too cold.
- Yeah.

1186
01:26:44,371 --> 01:26:45,455
Look.

1187
01:26:51,044 --> 01:26:52,796
Oh, I love this song.

1188
01:26:53,797 --> 01:26:54,881
Come on.

1189
01:27:06,726 --> 01:27:09,396
Aarav.
- Yes.

1190
01:27:09,646 --> 01:27:10,980
Thank you.

1191
01:27:12,482 --> 01:27:16,945
I feel like I am free..

1192
01:27:17,529 --> 01:27:19,531
I feel I am free now.

1193
01:27:20,156 --> 01:27:21,408
Honestly.

1194
01:27:23,910 --> 01:27:24,994
Not bad.

1195
01:27:25,704 --> 01:27:27,414
Your Hindi has improved.

1196
01:27:28,331 --> 01:27:30,542
But... I am serious.

1197
01:27:32,293 --> 01:27:33,878
I know you're serious.

1198
01:27:34,879 --> 01:27:36,047
You're welcome.

1199
01:27:45,724 --> 01:27:48,643
This is very cheesy.
- No.

1200
01:27:59,863 --> 01:28:01,114
Aarav.

1201
01:28:02,490 --> 01:28:03,575
Yes?

1202
01:28:04,993 --> 01:28:06,161
I..

1203
01:28:09,497 --> 01:28:10,457
Aashira.

1204
01:28:10,665 --> 01:28:11,624
What?

1205
01:28:12,208 --> 01:28:13,335
I love you.

1206
01:28:14,127 --> 01:28:15,670
I love you too.

1207
01:28:28,099 --> 01:28:30,393
Keep at it.
Keep at it.

1208
01:28:34,230 --> 01:28:35,273
Like everyone's dead.

1209
01:28:35,398 --> 01:28:36,733
Look at these guys.

1210
01:28:37,317 --> 01:28:39,194
They have passed out.
- Oh my God!

1211
01:28:39,861 --> 01:28:41,946
Amit, where were you?

1212
01:28:42,781 --> 01:28:43,948
You wanted to talk, right?

1213
01:28:44,115 --> 01:28:46,034
What happened?
- Look at Amy.

1214
01:28:48,244 --> 01:28:49,496
What's wrong?

1215
01:28:50,080 --> 01:28:51,247
What's this?

1216
01:28:51,998 --> 01:28:53,333
Amit Unnithan.

1217
01:28:59,297 --> 01:29:01,841
He's got a job.
- Congratulations!

1218
01:29:05,804 --> 01:29:07,055
He's got to join tomorrow.

1219
01:29:09,099 --> 01:29:11,434
Obviously,
you aren't going, right?

1220
01:29:13,353 --> 01:29:14,312
Right?

1221
01:29:15,605 --> 01:29:17,691
I am really sorry, but

1222
01:29:18,358 --> 01:29:20,193
this is very important for me.

1223
01:29:20,985 --> 01:29:23,571
I've been trying to get
this job for a very long time.

1224
01:29:23,738 --> 01:29:25,699
My life depends on it.

1225
01:29:26,658 --> 01:29:29,661
Okay, so.. You can
go after the dance off.

1226
01:29:30,829 --> 01:29:33,665
I can't. I have to go tomorrow.

1227
01:29:45,844 --> 01:29:47,053
You must go.

1228
01:29:47,554 --> 01:29:48,638
Go.

1229
01:29:48,847 --> 01:29:51,224
But, Aarav..
- It's okay.

1230
01:29:51,725 --> 01:29:54,310
It's okay, man. I know
this job's important for you.

1231
01:29:54,477 --> 01:29:55,562
You go.

1232
01:29:56,855 --> 01:29:58,023
Thanks, Aarav, but really..

1233
01:29:58,189 --> 01:30:00,025
It's okay, don't explain.

1234
01:30:00,191 --> 01:30:01,234
Don't explain, man.

1235
01:30:01,401 --> 01:30:02,986
We'll manage.
We'll work something out.

1236
01:30:03,111 --> 01:30:05,280
You go. Go!

1237
01:30:06,656 --> 01:30:08,408
Go!
- I'll see you soon.

1238
01:30:13,288 --> 01:30:14,539
Aarav..

1239
01:30:16,708 --> 01:30:18,376
Hey, guys, check this out.

1240
01:30:18,543 --> 01:30:20,837
Our crew works very hard
for this championship.

1241
01:30:21,004 --> 01:30:21,963
And we're confident.

1242
01:30:22,172 --> 01:30:24,966
We've been winning this
for the past three years.

1243
01:30:25,091 --> 01:30:27,844
There's absolutely no reason
why we won't do it again.

1244
01:30:28,011 --> 01:30:28,887
So there you have them.

1245
01:30:29,054 --> 01:30:31,348
A very confident
statement from Ceaser.

1246
01:30:31,556 --> 01:30:33,141
The man behind his crew.

1247
01:30:33,266 --> 01:30:35,518
Three times National
Dance-Off winners.

1248
01:30:35,685 --> 01:30:38,688
On the eve of the championship,
starting tomorrow.

1249
01:30:38,897 --> 01:30:41,191
As for how it actually goes,
stay tuned.

1250
01:30:41,316 --> 01:30:42,859
What're we going to do now?

1251
01:30:58,124 --> 01:30:59,417
We need your help.

1252
01:30:59,793 --> 01:31:01,503
And it's that time
of the year again, folks

1253
01:31:01,670 --> 01:31:03,296
when England is once again
caught in the grip

1254
01:31:03,421 --> 01:31:04,381
of dance mania.

1255
01:31:05,090 --> 01:31:07,008
We're here, at the National
Dance-Off championship

1256
01:31:07,133 --> 01:31:08,176
where the crowds are gathering

1257
01:31:08,301 --> 01:31:10,970
to watch teams from
all over the country, compete.

1258
01:31:11,554 --> 01:31:13,348
But one thing remains the same.

1259
01:31:13,932 --> 01:31:15,308
Ceaser's crew is
the crew to beat.

1260
01:31:15,475 --> 01:31:18,019
Hello and welcome to the
National Dance-Off competition

1261
01:31:18,144 --> 01:31:19,437
in Sheffield.

1262
01:31:19,604 --> 01:31:21,356
And the first act we're
going to see tonight

1263
01:31:21,523 --> 01:31:24,067
is status the remix monkey!

1264
01:31:36,621 --> 01:31:39,749
"Last week I was
walking down the street."

1265
01:31:40,667 --> 01:31:43,545
"You know 'cause feet
upon my feet."

1266
01:31:44,671 --> 01:31:48,008
"You bet those
super frosty lows."

1267
01:31:48,675 --> 01:31:51,428
"Gotta tell you, man,
you never know."

1268
01:31:52,303 --> 01:31:56,016
"My sympthesizers,
it doesn't matter."

1269
01:31:56,349 --> 01:31:59,060
"It might look banner.."

1270
01:31:59,227 --> 01:32:02,772
"Project glow, glow, glow..
- Yeah.."

1271
01:32:02,897 --> 01:32:04,107
"Yeah! Yeah!"

1272
01:32:06,526 --> 01:32:07,777
"Say, say.."

1273
01:32:08,737 --> 01:32:11,406
"I go easy on the coke,
you know, heavy on the green."

1274
01:32:11,573 --> 01:32:13,908
"Don't pop the pill,
oh fella me the aspirin."

1275
01:32:14,075 --> 01:32:16,202
"Only thing that she looks
at sound at the scene"

1276
01:32:16,327 --> 01:32:18,496
"And if they teach us,
it still be my pain."

1277
01:32:18,621 --> 01:32:21,041
"I go easy on the coke,
you know, heavy on the green."

1278
01:32:21,207 --> 01:32:23,543
"Don't pop the pill,
oh fella me the aspirin."

1279
01:32:23,668 --> 01:32:26,463
"Only thing that she looks
at sound at the scene"

1280
01:32:54,908 --> 01:32:57,744
Aarav. He is not going
to come.

1281
01:32:58,870 --> 01:33:00,372
Please do something, buddy.

1282
01:33:17,764 --> 01:33:20,058
Aarav, shall I try?

1283
01:33:20,892 --> 01:33:22,352
Shall I get someone?

1284
01:33:24,062 --> 01:33:25,397
I can come.

1285
01:33:25,939 --> 01:33:27,941
I mean I'll stand at the back.

1286
01:33:28,108 --> 01:33:29,567
At least we can dance.

1287
01:33:29,734 --> 01:33:31,319
It's not the time
to joke now, GG.

1288
01:33:31,736 --> 01:33:34,656
"We can play,
I'll just do acting."

1289
01:33:34,823 --> 01:33:36,408
"They always wanna try to
put you up in a cage."

1290
01:33:36,574 --> 01:33:38,410
"Try to put you on
a different page."

1291
01:33:38,618 --> 01:33:40,370
"Come on..
- I think the fact is.."

1292
01:33:40,537 --> 01:33:42,622
"that's right..
- Into just acting.."

1293
01:33:42,747 --> 01:33:44,207
"That's why they try to
put you up in a cage."

1294
01:33:44,374 --> 01:33:46,209
"Try to put you on
a different page."

1295
01:33:46,835 --> 01:33:48,670
"We.. we generating.."

1296
01:33:48,837 --> 01:33:50,672
"How busting, rather waiting."

1297
01:33:50,839 --> 01:33:53,008
"They keep investigating.."

1298
01:33:59,472 --> 01:34:02,183
"Just chill when they
don't need.. They need.."

1299
01:34:05,937 --> 01:34:09,774
I don't know anything about
what all of you rehearsed.

1300
01:34:14,320 --> 01:34:15,822
Just do your best, man.

1301
01:34:24,247 --> 01:34:25,331
Yay!

1302
01:34:25,457 --> 01:34:29,502
"Go! Go! Go!"

1303
01:34:29,753 --> 01:34:30,837
This is it, guys.

1304
01:34:30,962 --> 01:34:32,547
Let's show them
what we're made of.

1305
01:34:32,881 --> 01:34:34,674
Let's show them,
that with hard work

1306
01:34:34,841 --> 01:34:36,092
everything is possible.

1307
01:34:36,343 --> 01:34:37,510
Let's go kill them.

1308
01:34:40,180 --> 01:34:41,348
"They run.."

1309
01:34:42,349 --> 01:34:43,641
"Okay, we do.."

1310
01:34:44,059 --> 01:34:46,644
"P-Power to the B-Boyz!"

1311
01:34:46,770 --> 01:34:48,521
"Gonna move down..
- What we brining?"

1312
01:34:48,688 --> 01:34:51,149
"P-Power to the B-Boyz!
- What we bringing?"

1313
01:34:52,400 --> 01:34:54,319
"Go! Go! Go!
- Let's go."

1314
01:34:54,486 --> 01:34:56,613
"Gotta do it.
- Here we go! Here we go!"

1315
01:34:56,738 --> 01:34:58,865
"Yeah! Go! Go! Go!
Let's go!"

1316
01:34:58,990 --> 01:35:01,201
"We gotta do it!
Go! Go! Go!"

1317
01:35:01,326 --> 01:35:03,286
"Go! Go! Go!
It's the moving! Let's go!"

1318
01:35:03,453 --> 01:35:05,288
"Here we go! Here we go!"

1319
01:35:05,455 --> 01:35:07,624
"Go! Go! Go!
Let's go!"

1320
01:35:07,791 --> 01:35:09,959
"We gotta do it! Yeah!
Go! Go! Go!"

1321
01:35:10,085 --> 01:35:12,504
"B-Boyz sang,
B-Boyz seize.."

1322
01:35:12,629 --> 01:35:14,881
And now we've got Aarav's group

1323
01:35:15,048 --> 01:35:17,008
and they'd go for it.

1324
01:35:17,884 --> 01:35:19,177
Not today, Henry.

1325
01:37:42,278 --> 01:37:45,407
And now it's time
for the grand finale.

1326
01:37:45,532 --> 01:37:48,785
With Aarav's crew
versus Ceaser's crew.

1327
01:37:50,412 --> 01:37:52,664
My dreams were finally
coming true that day.

1328
01:37:53,748 --> 01:37:55,667
Ceaser and I were
on the same stage.

1329
01:37:56,543 --> 01:37:57,836
I don't remember how long

1330
01:37:58,003 --> 01:37:59,921
I've been waiting
for this moment.

1331
01:38:00,922 --> 01:38:03,425
And when my dreams
were finally coming true

1332
01:38:03,550 --> 01:38:05,176
I couldn't believe my eyes.

1333
01:38:06,219 --> 01:38:07,804
There was one difference though.

1334
01:38:08,638 --> 01:38:13,059
That day I wasn't with Ceaser,
I was against him.

1335
01:38:44,841 --> 01:38:46,634
Come on! Yeah!

1336
01:39:27,676 --> 01:39:29,010
"Like this."

1337
01:40:10,385 --> 01:40:11,803
"Do you need it?"

1338
01:40:14,014 --> 01:40:16,182
"Feel it now.
Do you need it?"

1339
01:40:16,558 --> 01:40:17,934
"Can you look in him?"

1340
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:20,020
"Feel it now.."

1341
01:41:01,811 --> 01:41:02,979
"My thing.."

1342
01:42:05,792 --> 01:42:06,960
Go, Aarav!

1343
01:43:01,056 --> 01:43:03,516
All right!
What a night it's been tonight!

1344
01:43:03,725 --> 01:43:06,436
This has been the
closest final in years.

1345
01:43:06,603 --> 01:43:09,814
I'm just going to get
the results from the judges now.

1346
01:43:10,940 --> 01:43:13,860
All right! The judges need
two more minutes to decide.

1347
01:43:14,069 --> 01:43:16,571
So who's cheering
for Aarav's group?

1348
01:43:19,032 --> 01:43:21,743
Make some noise
for Ceaser's group.

1349
01:43:29,167 --> 01:43:32,003
And finally,
the judges have decided

1350
01:43:32,170 --> 01:43:35,882
that the 15,000 pounds
for 1st and 2nd place

1351
01:43:36,049 --> 01:43:37,967
is going to be split
between both crews

1352
01:43:38,134 --> 01:43:39,594
because it's a tie.

1353
01:43:45,183 --> 01:43:47,185
We rock, buddy!

1354
01:44:04,828 --> 01:44:06,788
You're good. Very good.

1355
01:44:07,247 --> 01:44:09,082
But the rules saved you today.

1356
01:44:09,624 --> 01:44:11,334
There ain't no ties in life.

1357
01:44:12,127 --> 01:44:13,503
There's only one winner.

1358
01:44:14,796 --> 01:44:16,047
You said that.

1359
01:44:18,717 --> 01:44:20,135
Let's take this outside.

1360
01:44:22,554 --> 01:44:23,972
Let the town decide.

1361
01:44:24,806 --> 01:44:26,057
No rules.

1362
01:44:28,184 --> 01:44:29,894
We'll raise the stakes.

1363
01:44:30,061 --> 01:44:31,646
Winner gets 10,000.

1364
01:44:32,105 --> 01:44:33,273
That's what the winner
was supposed to get

1365
01:44:33,398 --> 01:44:34,733
in the first place, right?

1366
01:44:39,237 --> 01:44:41,197
No need to think so hard.

1367
01:44:42,657 --> 01:44:43,867
I am with you.

1368
01:44:44,659 --> 01:44:46,661
Tomorrow then, town center?

1369
01:44:51,750 --> 01:44:53,585
Okay, then. See you.

1370
01:45:11,353 --> 01:45:12,604
Thank you for today, buddy.

1371
01:45:12,771 --> 01:45:14,105
You're welcome, brother.
Anytime.

1372
01:45:14,230 --> 01:45:15,690
Okay, dance.

1373
01:45:15,857 --> 01:45:17,442
Let's dance!

1374
01:45:17,567 --> 01:45:19,402
Let's dance!

1375
01:45:39,005 --> 01:45:41,716
I can't lose this, man.
I am going.

1376
01:45:41,841 --> 01:45:43,927
Where?
- To meet Ceaser.

1377
01:45:44,260 --> 01:45:45,220
Why meet him?

1378
01:45:45,387 --> 01:45:46,971
We won't go ahead
with this dance off.

1379
01:45:48,139 --> 01:45:50,850
I mean look at you guys,
you all look so happy.

1380
01:45:51,434 --> 01:45:52,811
What if we lose tomorrow?

1381
01:45:54,104 --> 01:45:55,355
You'll lose your fees.

1382
01:45:57,107 --> 01:45:58,692
We did what we could.

1383
01:45:59,901 --> 01:46:01,611
I don't know what
I was thinking, man.

1384
01:46:01,986 --> 01:46:03,571
I was just being selfish again.

1385
01:46:04,447 --> 01:46:07,117
Anyway, I'm going to
go settle this.

1386
01:46:07,575 --> 01:46:09,869
And when I come back,
we're going to party.

1387
01:46:10,203 --> 01:46:12,288
We'll party after we win, Aarav.

1388
01:46:12,539 --> 01:46:14,124
I know what you're doing.

1389
01:46:15,458 --> 01:46:17,085
But we won't let you do it.

1390
01:46:17,711 --> 01:46:19,671
Not after making it this far.

1391
01:46:19,838 --> 01:46:21,715
Aarav, he's absolutely right.

1392
01:46:22,048 --> 01:46:23,925
It's time to show
these Britishers.

1393
01:46:24,092 --> 01:46:25,176
And we will.

1394
01:46:25,301 --> 01:46:27,303
Innit?
- Yeah man, innit!

1395
01:46:27,470 --> 01:46:28,680
Yes, I'm game for it!

1396
01:46:28,847 --> 01:46:31,891
I don't like to
be called coward.

1397
01:46:32,058 --> 01:46:34,769
It's time to get
my name changed.

1398
01:46:34,894 --> 01:46:35,854
See.

1399
01:46:36,062 --> 01:46:37,147
Yes, Aarav.

1400
01:46:37,272 --> 01:46:40,442
I wouldn't have said yes
if we had any chance of losing.

1401
01:46:41,109 --> 01:46:42,360
You can do it, bro.

1402
01:46:43,069 --> 01:46:46,281
Aarav. We've come this far.

1403
01:46:47,032 --> 01:46:49,367
This isn't just
your dream anymore.

1404
01:46:49,492 --> 01:46:51,661
We all really want to do this.

1405
01:46:51,828 --> 01:46:54,497
And now's our time
to show them who we are.

1406
01:46:55,498 --> 01:46:56,666
Come on.

1407
01:46:57,459 --> 01:46:59,294
I know you're doing this for me.

1408
01:47:00,128 --> 01:47:02,005
You're scared of losing
all the money, right?

1409
01:47:02,756 --> 01:47:04,466
Today you won for me.

1410
01:47:05,091 --> 01:47:07,010
Tomorrow you need
to win for yourself.

1411
01:47:07,385 --> 01:47:09,179
And we're all with you.

1412
01:47:09,763 --> 01:47:11,139
What the..

1413
01:47:11,264 --> 01:47:12,807
Innit!
- Inn...

1414
01:47:49,928 --> 01:47:51,346
You from India?

1415
01:47:52,972 --> 01:47:54,140
Yes.

1416
01:47:55,850 --> 01:47:58,687
Shouldn't the band on your wrist
be orange, white and green?

1417
01:48:01,022 --> 01:48:02,065
Yeah!

1418
01:48:03,692 --> 01:48:04,859
It should.

1419
01:48:11,491 --> 01:48:12,617
Thank you.

1420
01:48:18,873 --> 01:48:20,291
Thank you.
- Yes..

1421
01:48:20,917 --> 01:48:21,501
Thank you, sir.

1422
01:48:21,710 --> 01:48:23,670
Aashira, call everyone.
We've to meet now.

1423
01:48:25,255 --> 01:48:27,132
That old man made me realize.

1424
01:48:27,632 --> 01:48:31,011
Until now we were fighting
them as per their rules.

1425
01:48:31,886 --> 01:48:33,638
But it was time they realized

1426
01:48:34,014 --> 01:48:36,766
there's no country like India.

1427
01:48:37,475 --> 01:48:39,352
And we were about
to show them that.

1428
01:48:48,903 --> 01:48:52,073
Yeah..
- Do it..

1429
01:50:18,702 --> 01:50:22,539
"Put 'em up! Put 'em up!
Up! Up! Up!"

1430
01:50:22,706 --> 01:50:26,710
"Put 'em up! Put 'em up!
Up! Up! Up!"

1431
01:50:26,918 --> 01:50:30,964
"Put 'em up! Put 'em up!
Up! Up! Up!"

1432
01:50:31,131 --> 01:50:35,802
"Put 'em up! Put 'em up!
Up! Up! Up!"

1433
01:50:37,971 --> 01:50:39,014
"Dance it."

1434
01:50:42,017 --> 01:50:42,767
"Dance it."

1435
01:50:42,934 --> 01:50:44,853
"Let's brickbat,
we don't know."

1436
01:50:45,020 --> 01:50:46,980
"Look-alikes who can dance
who names we don't know."

1437
01:50:47,147 --> 01:50:48,982
"Rode out, all that,
greatest thing to go."

1438
01:50:49,149 --> 01:50:51,151
"On, on your marks,
ready-ready, set, let's go."

1439
01:50:51,317 --> 01:50:53,319
"Yeah, yeah.. You know
what time it is, show time."

1440
01:50:53,486 --> 01:50:55,363
"Get-get up on the floor,
'cause it's your time."

1441
01:50:55,530 --> 01:50:57,532
"That's-that up to the crew
who want you to shine."

1442
01:50:57,741 --> 01:51:00,076
"Romance.. - Showing
the way to stay your lam."

1443
01:51:00,660 --> 01:51:02,454
"Keep it, stay and
shut up."

1444
01:51:04,622 --> 01:51:05,331
"Dangerous!"

1445
01:51:05,498 --> 01:51:06,791
"Put 'em up! Put 'em up!"

1446
01:51:07,542 --> 01:51:08,960
"Put 'em up! Put 'em up!"

1447
01:51:13,298 --> 01:51:16,259
"Cause, you're ready, yo!
Put 'em up! Put 'em up!"

1448
01:51:16,509 --> 01:51:18,261
"Cause you are ready..
Put 'em up! Put 'em up!"

1449
01:51:18,386 --> 01:51:22,057
"When we enter the battlefield,
the enemy retreats."

1450
01:51:22,223 --> 01:51:26,061
"There's no one who
can defeat us."

1451
01:51:26,227 --> 01:51:27,437
"Shut up.."

1452
01:51:30,607 --> 01:51:34,778
"When we enter the battlefield,
the enemy retreats."

1453
01:51:34,903 --> 01:51:38,656
"There's no one
who can defeat us."

1454
01:51:38,990 --> 01:51:43,578
"We can conquer the world
with our dance."

1455
01:51:44,954 --> 01:51:49,292
"We can conquer the world
with our dance."

1456
01:51:49,417 --> 01:51:53,880
"Come shake your body."

1457
01:51:57,509 --> 01:51:59,844
"Get on the floor..
- We're Punjabi boys."

1458
01:51:59,969 --> 01:52:01,846
"We're Punjabi boys."

1459
01:52:02,013 --> 01:52:03,932
"We're Punjabi boys."

1460
01:52:04,099 --> 01:52:06,976
"We're Punjabi boys."

1461
01:52:08,061 --> 01:52:10,021
"Let's go.
Put 'em up! Put 'em up!"

1462
01:52:10,605 --> 01:52:11,898
"Put 'em up! Put 'em up!"

1463
01:52:12,065 --> 01:52:12,816
"Dangerous!"

1464
01:52:12,982 --> 01:52:14,317
"Put 'em up! Put 'em up!"

1465
01:52:14,984 --> 01:52:16,069
"Put 'em up! Put 'em up!"

1466
01:52:16,194 --> 01:52:17,320
"Dangerous!"

1467
01:52:43,888 --> 01:52:45,140
"Keep up.."

1468
01:52:45,932 --> 01:52:47,267
"Keep it up.."

1469
01:52:54,691 --> 01:52:56,151
"There you go.."

1470
01:53:05,035 --> 01:53:06,369
"Go so now.."

1471
01:53:06,828 --> 01:53:07,912
"Yeah.."

1472
01:53:09,205 --> 01:53:10,373
"Let's go."

1473
01:53:15,503 --> 01:53:17,964
"We're best of friends"

1474
01:53:18,089 --> 01:53:20,008
"and worst of enemies."

1475
01:53:20,175 --> 01:53:24,637
"We're generous at heart,
such is our unique style."

1476
01:53:28,350 --> 01:53:30,518
"We're best of friends"

1477
01:53:30,643 --> 01:53:32,729
"and worst of enemies."

1478
01:53:32,854 --> 01:53:36,775
"We're generous at heart,
such is our unique style."

1479
01:53:36,941 --> 01:53:42,155
"A Punjabi can rock
the entire party alone."

1480
01:53:43,198 --> 01:53:47,243
"A Punjabi can rock
the entire party alone."

1481
01:53:47,410 --> 01:53:52,749
"Come dance with me."

1482
01:53:55,543 --> 01:53:57,837
"Get on the floor..
- We're Punjabi boys."

1483
01:53:57,962 --> 01:53:59,714
"We're Punjabi boys."

1484
01:53:59,881 --> 01:54:02,050
"We're Punjabi boys."

1485
01:54:02,175 --> 01:54:04,969
"We're Punjabi boys."

1486
01:54:23,446 --> 01:54:27,534
"When we enter the battlefield,
the enemy retreats."

1487
01:54:27,701 --> 01:54:31,538
"There's no one
that can defeat us."

1488
01:54:31,871 --> 01:54:36,960
"We can conquer the world
with our dance."

1489
01:54:37,752 --> 01:54:42,132
"We can conquer the world
with our dance."

1490
01:54:42,298 --> 01:54:46,720
"Come shake your body."

1491
01:54:50,390 --> 01:54:52,684
"Get on the floor..
- We're Punjabi boys."

1492
01:54:52,809 --> 01:54:54,686
"We're Punjabi boys."

1493
01:54:54,853 --> 01:54:56,730
"We're Punjabi boys."

1494
01:54:56,938 --> 01:55:00,233
"We're Punjabi boys."

1495
01:55:01,735 --> 01:55:05,739
"Up! Up! Up!
Put 'em up! Put 'em up!"

1496
01:55:05,905 --> 01:55:08,742
"Up! Up! Up!"

1497
01:55:08,867 --> 01:55:12,829
"Put 'em up! Put 'em up!
Up! Up! Up!"

1498
01:55:12,996 --> 01:55:17,083
"Put 'em up! Put 'em up!
Up! Up! Up!"

1499
01:55:17,250 --> 01:55:18,543
"Put 'em up! Put 'em up!"

1500
01:55:22,047 --> 01:55:25,550
"Cause you are ready, yo!
Cause you are ready, yo!"

1501
01:55:25,717 --> 01:55:27,427
"Put 'em up! Put 'em up!
Come on!"

1502
01:55:47,530 --> 01:55:49,074
GG always said.

1503
01:55:49,741 --> 01:55:51,951
'Dance is no one's property.'

1504
01:55:53,078 --> 01:55:54,746
And we proved it that day.

1505
01:55:57,582 --> 01:55:59,209
I never wanted to show

1506
01:55:59,751 --> 01:56:01,294
that they are better than us.

1507
01:56:01,670 --> 01:56:04,798
But yes, I did want to prove

1508
01:56:05,757 --> 01:56:07,384
that we aren't bad either.

1509
01:56:08,843 --> 01:56:11,054
And I want to show
the entire world

1510
01:56:12,389 --> 01:56:14,182
that we're as good
as anyone else.

1511
01:56:20,563 --> 01:56:21,981
Nice story, young man.

1512
01:56:22,148 --> 01:56:25,193
But unfortunately, we're
not running a news channel.

1513
01:56:25,777 --> 01:56:27,028
We run a bank.

1514
01:56:27,987 --> 01:56:30,115
We need all the right documents.

1515
01:56:31,324 --> 01:56:32,701
Guarantees.

1516
01:56:33,159 --> 01:56:34,494
Guarantor.

1517
01:56:35,662 --> 01:56:36,996
And you don't have it.

1518
01:56:37,247 --> 01:56:39,624
And so we cannot
give you any loan.

1519
01:56:40,083 --> 01:56:41,126
Now, if you don't mind

1520
01:56:41,251 --> 01:56:42,877
can we get back to our work?

1521
01:56:43,003 --> 01:56:44,129
Please.

1522
01:56:44,462 --> 01:56:46,673
By the way,
thank you for entertaining us.

1523
01:56:50,427 --> 01:56:51,553
Thank you, sir.

1524
01:56:52,512 --> 01:56:53,805
All the best, Aarav.

1525
01:56:54,931 --> 01:56:56,057
Thank you.

1526
01:57:03,314 --> 01:57:04,733
Yeah. Sir..

1527
01:57:17,037 --> 01:57:18,204
Thank you.

1528
01:57:49,110 --> 01:57:51,863
"Tonight's the party's
going mad."

1529
02:01:53,229 --> 02:01:54,439
That's your set.

1530
02:01:55,231 --> 02:01:57,192
I was..
- Yeah..

1531
02:01:57,776 --> 02:01:59,527
Darn you! Allow me in.

1532
02:01:59,694 --> 02:02:01,029
What are you doing?

1533
02:02:01,196 --> 02:02:02,989
I am sorry..

1534
02:02:04,449 --> 02:02:05,992
I had given you water.

1535
02:02:07,202 --> 02:02:08,286
What..

1536
02:02:08,453 --> 02:02:09,287
Sorry.

1537
02:02:09,454 --> 02:02:11,873
Won't you say something?

1538
02:02:14,918 --> 02:02:17,170
Fool! What stupid..

1539
02:02:19,964 --> 02:02:21,299
Looking there..

1540
02:02:23,134 --> 02:02:25,470
Sorry, can we call..
- Give her the line.

1541
02:02:29,849 --> 02:02:30,642
Cut!
- Cut!

1542
02:02:30,809 --> 02:02:32,060
Cut!
- One more. Cut it!

1543
02:02:32,185 --> 02:02:32,769
Cut it!
- Cut it!

1544
02:02:32,977 --> 02:02:33,895
Cut!
- Cut!

1545
02:02:34,062 --> 02:02:35,313
Cut!
- Cut!

1546
02:02:35,480 --> 02:02:36,606
Can't it be any less?

1547
02:02:37,399 --> 02:02:38,942
Why slap me?
