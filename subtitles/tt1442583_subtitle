1
00:00:57,756 --> 00:01:00,032
It's not about coffee.

2
00:01:01,826 --> 00:01:04,864
It's about you and me, honey.

3
00:01:09,267 --> 00:01:11,713
It's not about coffee.

4
00:01:12,971 --> 00:01:16,282
It's about you and me, honey.

5
00:01:16,775 --> 00:01:23,693
Let's meet first.

6
00:01:24,382 --> 00:01:30,628
Let's meet first.

7
00:01:40,699 --> 00:01:42,838
We are miles apart.

8
00:01:43,201 --> 00:01:44,271
Cut. Cut. No.

9
00:01:44,736 --> 00:01:45,874
What are you doing?

10
00:01:46,171 --> 00:01:47,844
I'm sure you can sing better.

11
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:51,149
It will sound good if
you sing with heart.

12
00:01:51,843 --> 00:01:54,824
Shall we try just once.
- Sure. -It'll sound better.

13
00:01:55,213 --> 00:01:57,955
Come on. This song should be
best one of this album.

14
00:01:58,616 --> 00:02:00,425
1. 2. 3. 4.

15
00:02:00,852 --> 00:02:03,594
We are miles apart.

16
00:02:04,956 --> 00:02:07,129
I am here and you're there.

17
00:02:08,593 --> 00:02:10,971
We are miles apart.

18
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:15,902
I am here and you're there.

19
00:02:15,967 --> 00:02:21,610
Let's meet first.

20
00:02:23,641 --> 00:02:25,120
Thank you very much, sir.

21
00:02:28,179 --> 00:02:30,125
That bedroom. All the best.

22
00:02:30,782 --> 00:02:31,954
Thank you, sir.

23
00:02:34,652 --> 00:02:40,659
Many unfulfilled desires
await completion.

24
00:02:44,229 --> 00:02:50,771
Now this heart wants freedom
from the fear of separation.

25
00:02:53,638 --> 00:02:56,710
Mother,
will papa come late again today?

26
00:03:00,044 --> 00:03:06,325
I will tell you all
my hidden feelings.

27
00:03:06,851 --> 00:03:12,164
Let's meet first.

28
00:03:16,861 --> 00:03:18,135
What nonsense!

29
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,668
You want to experience
civilian life.

30
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,909
Don't forget that our
entire family has..

31
00:03:23,968 --> 00:03:26,141
...been in army to serve
this country.

32
00:03:27,071 --> 00:03:28,880
We've lived and died
for this country.

33
00:03:29,607 --> 00:03:30,915
And you..

34
00:03:33,378 --> 00:03:34,982
You want to go away from it.

35
00:03:36,381 --> 00:03:38,122
I'm not going away from the army,
slr.

36
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,822
Just once I want to
see those people..

37
00:03:42,687 --> 00:03:44,223
...for whom we sacrifice our lives,
sir.

38
00:03:46,724 --> 00:03:53,198
Let's embark on a journey
on unknown bonds.

39
00:03:54,599 --> 00:04:01,039
Unknowingly we break
many relationships.

40
00:04:02,273 --> 00:04:08,918
We neither listen to others
nor express our desires.

41
00:04:13,017 --> 00:04:18,330
Let's meet first.

42
00:04:20,925 --> 00:04:25,897
Let's meet first.

43
00:04:27,899 --> 00:04:29,207
Hey!

44
00:04:31,836 --> 00:04:33,281
Great! Come.

45
00:04:33,972 --> 00:04:35,815
Now rehearse the dialogue.

46
00:04:36,341 --> 00:04:39,754
Dialogue!
I just came to watch the shooting.

47
00:04:40,245 --> 00:04:41,986
Is Salman or other actor here?

48
00:04:42,714 --> 00:04:44,387
Tell me. No..

49
00:04:44,616 --> 00:04:46,755
Security, get him out.

50
00:04:46,818 --> 00:04:50,664
Get out!
- Hey, my ticket fell down.

51
00:04:52,056 --> 00:04:54,002
Hey, my ticket fell down.
What are you doing?

52
00:04:56,661 --> 00:04:58,106
Hey! Ticket please.

53
00:04:58,162 --> 00:05:00,938
I was watching shooting there.
My ticket got lost there.

54
00:05:02,901 --> 00:05:06,348
You came to Mumbai for first time.
- Yes. -Welcome. Come.

55
00:05:06,571 --> 00:05:07,845
Where? -Come.

56
00:05:07,906 --> 00:05:13,015
Caress me secretly
with your hands.

57
00:05:16,681 --> 00:05:23,291
Then say with smile,
do you recognize me.

58
00:05:24,188 --> 00:05:30,161
The one whom I've seen with
closed eyes, it's you.

59
00:05:36,901 --> 00:05:38,141
Manik.

60
00:05:40,038 --> 00:05:41,210
Manik.

61
00:05:42,974 --> 00:05:44,248
Swami.

62
00:05:59,324 --> 00:06:02,168
It's not about coffee. -Come on.

63
00:06:03,661 --> 00:06:06,642
It's about you and me, honey.

64
00:06:07,098 --> 00:06:10,102
'We are miles apart.

65
00:06:11,569 --> 00:06:14,049
I am here and you're there.

66
00:06:14,706 --> 00:06:19,815
Let's meet first.

67
00:06:25,049 --> 00:06:26,289
Blue Bell Cafe.

68
00:06:27,085 --> 00:06:28,723
Blue bell Cafe isn't
just in Mumbai..

69
00:06:28,786 --> 00:06:30,060
...but every corner of India.

70
00:06:30,922 --> 00:06:33,129
Kill the competition with pricing
and brand build up.

71
00:06:34,058 --> 00:06:36,664
Buy all prime location.
Property is asset.

72
00:06:37,061 --> 00:06:39,871
Blue Bell shall be the
future of India. Next.

73
00:06:41,899 --> 00:06:43,276
Lucky Cafe.

74
00:06:43,935 --> 00:06:46,108
This will be our prime location.

75
00:06:46,337 --> 00:06:48,180
And Mr. Lincoln believes
that this will..

76
00:06:48,239 --> 00:06:49,843
...be like a 'Jewel' for Blue Bell.

77
00:06:50,274 --> 00:06:52,220
College students on one side..

78
00:06:53,011 --> 00:06:55,617
...and all these office goes
on the other side.

79
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,818
Exclusive location of that area.

80
00:06:58,249 --> 00:07:00,661
There will be huge profit.

81
00:07:00,718 --> 00:07:03,995
We've to acquire this
Cafe at any cost.

82
00:07:05,056 --> 00:07:07,161
Lights please.
Thank you very much.

83
00:07:08,226 --> 00:07:09,569
David.

84
00:07:10,795 --> 00:07:11,830
Here.

85
00:07:12,663 --> 00:07:18,341
Well, Lucky Cafe will become
Blue Bell Cafe.

86
00:07:19,003 --> 00:07:23,713
Sir, this..
can I handle Lucky Cafe?

87
00:07:24,976 --> 00:07:27,354
Sure. Do you know anyone there?

88
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:31,784
No. Actually my wife knows
aunt Dilshad very well.

89
00:07:32,316 --> 00:07:34,694
Meeting is over and thank
you very much.

90
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:43,363
Amit,
I want this Cafe at any cost.

91
00:07:43,628 --> 00:07:46,108
Will it be done?
- Consider it done.

92
00:07:46,631 --> 00:07:48,338
I know you can do it.
You're my man.

93
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:01,586
Ramu, come here. Listen. -Madam.

94
00:08:02,647 --> 00:08:06,220
Keep all the rotten
sweet limes aside.

95
00:08:07,218 --> 00:08:10,097
Rotten? You mean bad ones. -Yes.

96
00:08:10,154 --> 00:08:11,861
Aunt, what will you do with it?

97
00:08:12,056 --> 00:08:13,797
I'll make jam of them.

98
00:08:13,858 --> 00:08:16,202
Will you take sweet limes to Juhu.

99
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:19,537
Duffer,
not Juhu, I'll make tasty Jam.

100
00:08:19,697 --> 00:08:21,699
0k. Give me a bag, brother.

101
00:08:21,933 --> 00:08:23,344
Give it to me. -Madam.

102
00:08:24,635 --> 00:08:25,670
Madam, its rotten.

103
00:08:25,736 --> 00:08:28,273
Madam, you'll return to Cafe.
If you want, I'll wait.

104
00:08:28,773 --> 00:08:30,650
Didn't you find another passenger?

105
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:32,551
Manik, tell madam to go with me.

106
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:35,181
I'll wait. -It's total 20 pieces.

107
00:08:35,246 --> 00:08:36,816
Only 20. -Yes.

108
00:08:42,019 --> 00:08:43,794
You're trying to fool me.

109
00:08:44,122 --> 00:08:46,830
Rogue! I'm Dilshad. Dilshad.

110
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:48,934
Give me 4 dozens of good ones.

111
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,299
Do it. -Bring the bag and
give her good ones.

112
00:08:51,362 --> 00:08:53,865
You got 70 percent
in exam last year.

113
00:08:54,031 --> 00:08:55,772
This year you'll surely
get 100 percent.

114
00:08:55,933 --> 00:08:58,971
Just send 1000 rupees and take the
question papers. -Don't worry.

115
00:08:59,036 --> 00:09:00,379
<i>0k'? Bye.</i>

116
00:09:01,239 --> 00:09:03,150
Good morning, sir.
- Breakfast was nice yesterday.

117
00:09:03,207 --> 00:09:06,552
Breakfast?
Is this hotel your in-law's house?

118
00:09:07,111 --> 00:09:09,182
Will you stay here for
the entire year.

119
00:09:09,914 --> 00:09:11,325
Aren't you ashamed?

120
00:09:11,582 --> 00:09:14,825
It's a matter of pride to have
a permanent address in Mumbai.

121
00:09:15,153 --> 00:09:17,326
By the way,
struggle is going on, Warden.

122
00:09:17,555 --> 00:09:19,796
One day we've to leave
this place too.

123
00:09:20,691 --> 00:09:22,329
Right now I'll relieve myself.

124
00:09:22,727 --> 00:09:24,764
Disgusting! -No, it's natural.

125
00:09:26,631 --> 00:09:28,076
Vikramjit Singh reporting, sir.

126
00:09:28,132 --> 00:09:30,976
From which TV channel.
There is no 'Breaking news' here.

127
00:09:31,302 --> 00:09:33,043
Get out. Let me work.

128
00:09:33,204 --> 00:09:35,115
Go on.
You people come anywhere for news.

129
00:09:36,874 --> 00:09:38,615
Brother,
who will show me my room here?

130
00:09:38,676 --> 00:09:40,656
I can show you the colours,
not rooms.

131
00:09:42,213 --> 00:09:44,193
It's a strange city! Sir. Sir.

132
00:09:44,649 --> 00:09:47,289
Hello. Hello. Dilnaz.

133
00:09:47,752 --> 00:09:48,958
How are you, child?

134
00:09:49,187 --> 00:09:50,996
I'm fine. Just a minute.

135
00:09:51,255 --> 00:09:52,791
Shopping for the Cafe.

136
00:09:54,825 --> 00:09:56,304
It's always the Cafe.

137
00:09:57,094 --> 00:09:59,165
I've been hearing this
since childhood.

138
00:09:59,363 --> 00:10:01,274
For you Cafe comes before
even your daughter.

139
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:03,646
It's not so. -Let it be.

140
00:10:03,834 --> 00:10:05,177
You don't care for me.

141
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:07,206
Child, you know I love you.

142
00:10:07,371 --> 00:10:08,907
Yes. I know.

143
00:10:08,973 --> 00:10:12,113
That's why Aryan is
coming to fix you.

144
00:10:12,577 --> 00:10:13,851
Really?

145
00:10:14,212 --> 00:10:16,192
How is he? -He's fine.
He's growing up.

146
00:10:16,847 --> 00:10:18,690
Gel in hair. MNM.

147
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:20,790
And he's stubborn, just like you.

148
00:10:20,851 --> 00:10:22,296
And he's coming to
India determined..

149
00:10:22,353 --> 00:10:25,800
...to take you back to Australia.
- Really? And you?

150
00:10:26,357 --> 00:10:27,927
Will you come on leave?

151
00:10:30,328 --> 00:10:33,707
Hello. Hello, Dil.. hello.

152
00:10:42,073 --> 00:10:43,347
Mr. Subramaniyam.

153
00:10:43,975 --> 00:10:45,318
Sir has called you.

154
00:10:57,922 --> 00:10:59,333
Yes, Mr. Subramaniyam.

155
00:11:00,858 --> 00:11:02,064
You..

156
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,862
I can't praise you enough.

157
00:11:06,297 --> 00:11:08,937
Your contribution in this company
has been invaluable.

158
00:11:09,233 --> 00:11:12,874
Mr. Subramaniyam, you're the
backbone of this law firm.

159
00:11:12,937 --> 00:11:15,178
You get your cheques because
of him. And what a man!

160
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:19,044
He sacrificed his career
and courtroom..

161
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:21,317
...for treatment of his mother.

162
00:11:21,746 --> 00:11:23,191
Wow! What a man!

163
00:11:24,882 --> 00:11:26,259
I'd heard from my father..

164
00:11:27,084 --> 00:11:29,724
...that when he used to go
to court to fight cases"

165
00:11:30,121 --> 00:11:32,226
...Mr. Subramaniyam used
to sit in this..

166
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:34,099
...office and prepare such briefs..

167
00:11:35,092 --> 00:11:37,038
...that it used to become
easy for him to win.

168
00:11:37,361 --> 00:11:38,806
Right?

169
00:11:39,196 --> 00:11:40,766
What a reputation he has!

170
00:11:41,032 --> 00:11:42,636
Straight-forward! No nonsense!

171
00:11:43,801 --> 00:11:45,075
Thank you, sir.

172
00:11:46,771 --> 00:11:49,411
Now Mr. Subramaniyam has requested
for an extension.

173
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:54,685
But we feel that now
time has come for..

174
00:11:54,745 --> 00:11:56,190
...you to take care of your health.

175
00:11:57,748 --> 00:11:59,318
We'll surely miss you.

176
00:12:00,217 --> 00:12:03,198
But in this computer age,
we've to move forward.

177
00:12:27,378 --> 00:12:28,857
No. Thanks.

178
00:12:33,017 --> 00:12:34,291
All right then. Well..

179
00:12:34,885 --> 00:12:36,091
All the best.

180
00:12:36,354 --> 00:12:40,325
And you know, if we've every
caused you trouble..

181
00:12:40,391 --> 00:12:41,870
...then we're deeply sorry.

182
00:12:42,093 --> 00:12:44,039
No. Don't be sorry, Mr. Sood.

183
00:12:45,896 --> 00:12:47,967
I never said sorry for
the last 30 years.

184
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,373
First of all we shouldn't
do something..

185
00:12:51,602 --> 00:12:52,945
...for which we've to say sorry.

186
00:12:54,338 --> 00:12:56,284
This makes a man weak.

187
00:12:56,974 --> 00:12:59,853
And weak man can't handle
this responsibility..

188
00:13:00,177 --> 00:13:03,715
...which you and your computer
has to face in coming days.

189
00:13:06,884 --> 00:13:08,830
You never know what it
means to get defeated.

190
00:13:09,887 --> 00:13:12,026
Even I don't want to
see you defeated.

191
00:13:12,089 --> 00:13:14,865
So don't be sorry, young man.
I'm not sorry.

192
00:13:24,735 --> 00:13:26,009
For you.

193
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,751
Om! Take flowers in hand.

194
00:13:38,816 --> 00:13:40,955
I love you. -Offer it to God.

195
00:13:41,018 --> 00:13:44,295
Why are you staring me!
- Hail Lord!

196
00:13:45,055 --> 00:13:47,001
Hey, what a lovely place, son!

197
00:13:49,059 --> 00:13:51,403
Aunt! -I'd called her.

198
00:13:52,129 --> 00:13:53,733
Priest, you continue.
I'll be back.

199
00:13:53,798 --> 00:13:55,641
It's for you. -Thank you, aunt.

200
00:13:56,066 --> 00:13:58,876
Wow! -Aunt! -Nice man. -Come.

201
00:13:59,069 --> 00:14:01,345
Congrats.
- Show me the house. -Yes.

202
00:14:01,739 --> 00:14:04,720
Big place for party.
So when should we've one?

203
00:14:05,176 --> 00:14:07,554
<i>No parties. 0k'? Not at a“. -Ok.</i>

204
00:14:10,948 --> 00:14:12,359
We'll surely miss you.

205
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:16,031
But in this computer age,
we've to move forward.

206
00:14:17,188 --> 00:14:18,861
I don't understand.

207
00:14:19,557 --> 00:14:22,561
What happened? -I told you many
times to sell this car.

208
00:14:22,626 --> 00:14:25,937
Do you get it? -It's old. It
breaks down anytime. -Car is fine.

209
00:14:25,996 --> 00:14:28,636
We don't need to sell it.
- You don't get me, father.

210
00:14:28,699 --> 00:14:31,236
What not? -I told you often..
- Is he your father?

211
00:14:31,602 --> 00:14:33,809
Yes. So what?
- Is this the way to talk to him?

212
00:14:35,673 --> 00:14:37,880
You think since he has
gone old he's useless.

213
00:14:38,342 --> 00:14:39,878
Behave yourself.

214
00:14:42,346 --> 00:14:45,816
Why does every youngster think
he's wiser than old people?

215
00:14:47,384 --> 00:14:48,886
Talk in a proper manner.

216
00:14:56,627 --> 00:14:57,935
What? What's his problem?

217
00:15:20,751 --> 00:15:23,595
Bye. Bye, Harry.
- We'll party. -See you.

218
00:15:26,357 --> 00:15:29,634
This Harry chatters a lot.

219
00:15:32,363 --> 00:15:35,207
I didn't get a chance
to meet aunt Dilshad.

220
00:15:37,234 --> 00:15:38,770
Was she angry?

221
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:41,672
No.

222
00:15:43,774 --> 00:15:45,651
What happened? Are you not happy?

223
00:15:46,777 --> 00:15:49,587
I was so happy even in
our one room flat.

224
00:15:54,285 --> 00:15:55,787
What happened?

225
00:16:00,824 --> 00:16:02,098
What happened?

226
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,003
You're worried. Are you scared?

227
00:16:04,328 --> 00:16:06,069
Don't worry.
I've got it all sorted out.

228
00:16:07,097 --> 00:16:08,542
I've planned everything.

229
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:11,677
I mean we'll manage
few months on..

230
00:16:11,735 --> 00:16:13,874
...the return of our mutual funds.

231
00:16:13,938 --> 00:16:15,611
Then on salary.

232
00:16:16,674 --> 00:16:18,813
I mean, promotion.
Double the salary.

233
00:16:19,777 --> 00:16:23,782
We won't even know how we'll
return our loan. Trust me.

234
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:29,923
You're explaining to me
or convincing yourself.

235
00:16:32,189 --> 00:16:34,692
God! Why do I even try?

236
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:41,173
Why do you drink so much?

237
00:16:41,699 --> 00:16:45,374
It's neither good for you
nor for Ankur's allergy.

238
00:16:46,637 --> 00:16:50,107
He has even allergy from sports,
outdoors, games..

239
00:16:53,344 --> 00:16:57,850
All day long he sits with
book like you. Book-worm.

240
00:16:58,282 --> 00:16:59,727
Then why blame me?

241
00:17:01,185 --> 00:17:02,596
Why blame you?

242
00:17:03,687 --> 00:17:05,132
Spend some time with him, Amit.

243
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:07,901
If you play with him,
he'll get some strength.

244
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:09,096
If his health improves..

245
00:17:09,159 --> 00:17:11,002
...his allergy too will
come under control.

246
00:17:11,328 --> 00:17:12,705
Spend time with him, Amit.

247
00:17:12,763 --> 00:17:14,037
Time? Oh!

248
00:17:15,699 --> 00:17:18,908
Time. After accident I
was home for one year.

249
00:17:20,204 --> 00:17:22,241
And today when I'm going to work..

250
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:25,784
...you've a problem. Fine? -No..

251
00:17:27,711 --> 00:17:30,055
I won't concentrate.
I'll sit at home. Ok?

252
00:17:30,114 --> 00:17:31,650
I didn't say so, Amit.

253
00:17:31,949 --> 00:17:33,587
Then what did you say, Anita?

254
00:17:35,352 --> 00:17:37,628
What do you want?
I shouldn't work hard.

255
00:17:38,589 --> 00:17:40,591
For whom do I work hard?
For you people. Right?

256
00:17:41,225 --> 00:17:44,934
Hadn't I work hard, how would
we've got this house and car?

257
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:49,206
Amit, listen. -Listen to me. Darn!

258
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:56,315
Hello.
Yes, sir. Not a problem, sir.

259
00:17:57,174 --> 00:17:59,745
Yes, sir. Go on. No, sir.

260
00:18:00,944 --> 00:18:03,788
I'll take leave on some other day.
Don't worry.

261
00:18:04,181 --> 00:18:06,127
Don't worry, sir. Thank you.

262
00:18:10,154 --> 00:18:11,724
What? Now what?

263
00:18:12,256 --> 00:18:14,293
What should I've told him?
We're fighting?

264
00:18:14,758 --> 00:18:16,533
Or should I've disconnected
his phone?

265
00:18:17,261 --> 00:18:19,707
You don't even seem to understand.
Anyways..

266
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:22,767
...I'm going. I've to go.

267
00:18:41,985 --> 00:18:45,592
Paging for Mr. Sandesh Samuel.
Please come to Admin account.

268
00:18:52,229 --> 00:18:55,335
Anita.
Your house is very nice and big.

269
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,942
He's bought a football
field for a house.

270
00:18:59,002 --> 00:19:01,346
What?
- And only three players to play.

271
00:19:02,506 --> 00:19:03,883
No, Anita.

272
00:19:04,308 --> 00:19:05,844
It's not entirely Amit's fault.

273
00:19:06,143 --> 00:19:08,123
You should question yourself too.

274
00:19:08,612 --> 00:19:11,252
Come on, Dilshad. I'm trying too.

275
00:19:11,315 --> 00:19:12,623
I'm trying.

276
00:19:12,816 --> 00:19:14,625
But it's your responsibility too.

277
00:19:14,852 --> 00:19:16,126
You always talk of Ankur.

278
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:19,261
Smile. Come on smile.

279
00:19:20,591 --> 00:19:22,628
You look so beautiful
when you smile.

280
00:19:22,926 --> 00:19:25,236
When Amit comes home,
smile this way.

281
00:19:25,763 --> 00:19:27,174
Everything will be fine.

282
00:19:27,598 --> 00:19:28,941
And you'll start talking again.

283
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:35,047
How should I talk to him?

284
00:19:35,339 --> 00:19:37,819
We talk only when we fight.

285
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:39,218
Hmm! -Exactly.

286
00:19:41,845 --> 00:19:43,620
Oh my God! Sorry.

287
00:19:43,881 --> 00:19:46,862
Really sorry.
- People don't seem to understand.

288
00:19:46,917 --> 00:19:49,864
First they err then forget
after saying sorry.

289
00:19:51,155 --> 00:19:52,828
Excuse me.

290
00:19:53,857 --> 00:19:55,131
You broke the bottle.

291
00:19:55,192 --> 00:19:56,830
Listen, I look where I go.

292
00:19:56,894 --> 00:19:59,170
I think twice before
touching a thing.

293
00:19:59,229 --> 00:20:01,800
Got it? You broke the bottle.
You'll pay for it.

294
00:20:01,865 --> 00:20:04,709
What nonsense! Has he gone mad?

295
00:20:05,702 --> 00:20:06,737
What?

296
00:20:06,804 --> 00:20:08,374
What did you say?
- Why do you abuse me?

297
00:20:08,605 --> 00:20:10,380
I didn't abuse you.
You broke the bottle. You pay.

298
00:20:10,607 --> 00:20:12,848
Listen. I was holding. You
were holding. Then I left.

299
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:14,753
After that you left it.
- You left it.

300
00:20:14,812 --> 00:20:16,951
No. I was holding. You left it.

301
00:20:17,014 --> 00:20:19,221
I left it first.
Then you left it. -No.

302
00:20:19,283 --> 00:20:22,628
You've to pay. -No. Try to
understand. Try to be reasonable.

303
00:20:22,686 --> 00:20:25,223
Uncle. Uncle. -I'm not your uncle.

304
00:20:25,289 --> 00:20:27,291
Let it be, Anita.
- And why are you paying?

305
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:29,995
Why are you paying?
What do you mean by this?

306
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:33,000
I've asthma so sometimes
I do this..

307
00:20:33,163 --> 00:20:36,201
Don't do this. Ok?
- I've to do it. -Dilshad, chill.

308
00:20:36,266 --> 00:20:38,177
What do you mean chill?
- Let it be.

309
00:20:38,235 --> 00:20:40,340
Hey.. -Sir. 0k, sir.

310
00:20:40,404 --> 00:20:43,351
Hello, Mr. Gupta. -Hello, madam.
How are you? -Listen.

311
00:20:43,407 --> 00:20:45,148
Listen to me first.

312
00:20:46,243 --> 00:20:50,089
Oh God! -It was like this.
And I was holding it.

313
00:20:50,147 --> 00:20:51,421
It was holding it from here.

314
00:20:51,648 --> 00:20:52,991
Then you put.. -Sir..

315
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:57,123
And I know.
You're making mockery out of me.

316
00:20:57,921 --> 00:21:00,925
Hey! Learn to talk to women
properly. -Come on.

317
00:21:00,991 --> 00:21:04,165
Show some respect. -I'm keeping
quiet because you're a lady. Ok?

318
00:21:04,228 --> 00:21:07,368
Please. -Ok. -Please listen to me,
sir. -Let me go.

319
00:21:07,631 --> 00:21:09,611
Let me go. -Ok. -Go.

320
00:21:10,167 --> 00:21:12,306
Demon! -Thank you, sir. -Loafer!

321
00:21:13,303 --> 00:21:15,044
RS. 148.50. Sir.

322
00:21:24,381 --> 00:21:26,019
Thank you. -What is this? -Next.

323
00:21:28,118 --> 00:21:30,860
You let it be.
I'll pay. -Give me my change.

324
00:21:31,288 --> 00:21:33,791
Sir, I've no change so I gave you
chocolate. Thank you, sir.

325
00:21:34,391 --> 00:21:35,927
I want my change.

326
00:21:37,394 --> 00:21:38,964
Sir, I don't have change.

327
00:21:40,197 --> 00:21:42,199
Then you'll give chocolate
instead.

328
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,803
It means if I give you something
else for this..

329
00:21:45,869 --> 00:21:47,280
...will you give me the goods?

330
00:21:47,771 --> 00:21:50,183
How much is it?- Sir. Sir.

331
00:21:52,042 --> 00:21:57,355
What is he doing? -I bought it
for 390. One cost Rs. 195.

332
00:21:57,714 --> 00:21:59,022
Take this in exchange for it.

333
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:01,191
Give me change. -Sir, this..

334
00:22:01,885 --> 00:22:03,762
This is my currency. -Sir.

335
00:22:04,121 --> 00:22:05,657
What happened, sir? -l..

336
00:22:05,722 --> 00:22:08,328
I asked for change,
she gave me chocolate.

337
00:22:08,558 --> 00:22:11,562
Oh! Excuse me, sir.
How much is it? Rs. 1.50.

338
00:22:11,628 --> 00:22:13,232
Take your change, sir.
- Why are you giving me?

339
00:22:13,297 --> 00:22:15,834
She should give me.
Give it to her. -Give it to her.

340
00:22:15,899 --> 00:22:18,379
If you've opened a shop,
you should keep change. -Sir.

341
00:22:19,336 --> 00:22:20,940
Take this. -Give chocolate too.

342
00:22:21,004 --> 00:22:23,848
Sir, it's for your grandchildren.
- Yes.

343
00:22:24,908 --> 00:22:28,185
What do you think? Will every
old man have grandchildren?

344
00:22:29,146 --> 00:22:30,750
No. Not necessary, sir.

345
00:22:35,052 --> 00:22:38,295
Bye, sir.
- What is this, Mr. Gupta?

346
00:22:38,722 --> 00:22:40,793
They're very bad.
- Come on. Let's leave now.

347
00:22:41,291 --> 00:22:45,239
Sorry, sir. Without having tea
here my day doesn't pass well.

348
00:22:45,662 --> 00:22:48,666
But don't worry.
I won't charge you for waiting.

349
00:22:54,338 --> 00:22:56,079
Hey! Mr. Amit.

350
00:22:56,139 --> 00:23:00,110
Amit.
- Manik, you're here. How are you?

351
00:23:00,177 --> 00:23:03,181
Aunt, how are you?
- You're in suit. Good. Very good.

352
00:23:03,613 --> 00:23:06,219
Manik, go and bring custard
for Amit. -Yes.

353
00:23:06,283 --> 00:23:09,787
Listen. Put his special raspberry
sauce too. -Ok.

354
00:23:09,853 --> 00:23:11,855
You remembered. -How can I forget?

355
00:23:11,922 --> 00:23:13,595
No formalities, aunt.

356
00:23:13,657 --> 00:23:15,933
It's nothing.
You'll pay for it. Sit down.

357
00:23:16,593 --> 00:23:18,664
Manik,
are you eating for bringing it?

358
00:23:18,729 --> 00:23:20,709
Aunt. -You fool.

359
00:23:20,864 --> 00:23:23,242
Last time you repaired it.
Took the full amount.

360
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:26,713
But it still leaks.
- I'm fixing it, madam.

361
00:23:27,738 --> 00:23:30,116
Look, Amit. He just takes
the money and leaves.

362
00:23:30,173 --> 00:23:31,743
He doesn't work properly. -Chill.

363
00:23:31,975 --> 00:23:33,886
You've maintained the place well,
aunt

364
00:23:33,944 --> 00:23:36,151
Just a few changes and
this place will rock.

365
00:23:36,313 --> 00:23:39,988
Look at this TV.
Put a nice LCD in place of it.

366
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:43,293
Keep open kitchen.
It will give international feel.

367
00:23:43,754 --> 00:23:45,927
And instead of custard,
use trufeel.

368
00:23:45,989 --> 00:23:48,902
And instead of bread,
let's bring in the corsone..

369
00:23:49,159 --> 00:23:52,834
And superman. You need to
change your uniform. Ok?

370
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:54,338
You're right.

371
00:23:54,865 --> 00:23:57,141
But how will we get the money?
- It'll be arranged.

372
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,649
Don't worry. Sit. -Aunt Dilshad.
Same old aunt Dilshad. No change.

373
00:24:02,939 --> 00:24:05,749
Aunt, my company Blue Bells..

374
00:24:06,109 --> 00:24:08,783
...Is a big international company.
They've lots of money.

375
00:24:08,845 --> 00:24:11,621
Really? -They've marked
ten places in Mumbai..

376
00:24:11,681 --> 00:24:13,024
...to open a Cafe. -Really?

377
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:16,888
If you agree, I'll add Lucky
Cafe too in the list.

378
00:24:17,287 --> 00:24:19,858
Aunt,
you've got such a beautiful place.

379
00:24:20,223 --> 00:24:23,204
At least, you'll get 30-35 Crores.

380
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,704
Definitely. -35 Crores.

381
00:24:26,163 --> 00:24:27,767
Maybe even 40, aunt.

382
00:24:28,965 --> 00:24:30,911
Only the best for you.
You just have to say yes.

383
00:24:31,601 --> 00:24:33,638
In a day, you'll get the
cheque in your account.

384
00:24:33,703 --> 00:24:36,149
Oh God! -Yes. -35 Crores.

385
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,342
What should I've to do?

386
00:24:39,309 --> 00:24:43,223
You've to sell it. -But don't
worry. I'll convince them..

387
00:24:43,313 --> 00:24:45,054
...that two things won't
change from here.

388
00:24:45,115 --> 00:24:47,026
First is your gramophone.

389
00:24:47,084 --> 00:24:50,691
And second will be my beautiful
aunt Dilshad.

390
00:24:51,121 --> 00:24:52,998
You can still manage the place,
aunt

391
00:24:53,857 --> 00:24:56,303
Hey.. what are you saying, son?

392
00:24:56,359 --> 00:24:58,361
L.. I'm still the manager here.

393
00:24:58,595 --> 00:25:00,905
Aunt, but 35..
- Just a minute. Phone.

394
00:25:01,665 --> 00:25:02,905
Manik, take the phone.

395
00:25:02,966 --> 00:25:05,640
You were right, Amit.
- There isn't LCD.

396
00:25:05,702 --> 00:25:07,978
Furniture is old.
Kitchen isn't international.

397
00:25:08,171 --> 00:25:09,946
Manik and Swami has no uniform.

398
00:25:10,107 --> 00:25:12,713
But it makes no difference
to my customers. -Hello.

399
00:25:12,909 --> 00:25:17,255
Hello. -Cool and Clean. -This
isn't 'Cool and Clean'. Stupid.

400
00:25:17,747 --> 00:25:19,920
So many people come
here who start"

401
00:25:19,983 --> 00:25:21,963
...their day with tea and bread.

402
00:25:22,018 --> 00:25:23,895
They.. -Aunt, one egg.

403
00:25:24,321 --> 00:25:26,062
Thank you. -Where will they go?

404
00:25:26,556 --> 00:25:27,762
And my college students.

405
00:25:28,058 --> 00:25:29,196
There is library here.

406
00:25:29,259 --> 00:25:31,671
They get cycle on hire.
Compound is here.

407
00:25:32,028 --> 00:25:34,167
Kids come here for pre-school.

408
00:25:34,331 --> 00:25:36,242
If you want to eat Dutch truffle..

409
00:25:36,299 --> 00:25:38,210
...you can eat in five star hotels.

410
00:25:38,969 --> 00:25:41,609
Hey, you didn't eat custard.

411
00:25:41,905 --> 00:25:44,078
Come on. Eat it.
- Sorry, aunt. You felt bad.

412
00:25:44,141 --> 00:25:45,677
No, dear. -Aunt..

413
00:25:46,076 --> 00:25:47,851
Then, aunt.. -Give me money..

414
00:25:48,211 --> 00:25:50,885
...offer is nice. Think again.

415
00:25:51,181 --> 00:25:53,855
Hey, Manik. Don't waste time.

416
00:25:54,251 --> 00:25:57,255
He'll pay.
- Yes, aunt. Take money tomorrow.

417
00:25:57,721 --> 00:25:59,894
Amit, let's not waste time.

418
00:25:59,956 --> 00:26:02,129
Why think of the impossible?

419
00:26:03,727 --> 00:26:05,707
Yes. -Amit.

420
00:26:06,196 --> 00:26:09,734
Son, you've become a big boy.
Beard and moustache.

421
00:26:09,966 --> 00:26:11,343
Doesn't Anita give you food?

422
00:26:11,568 --> 00:26:13,570
You've slimmed..
are you getting late?

423
00:26:14,004 --> 00:26:15,278
You've to go to work.

424
00:26:15,338 --> 00:26:17,784
Yes.
- Go. Work is important. -Ok, aunt.

425
00:26:17,841 --> 00:26:20,720
Tell Anita that I've baked cake.
Send her in the evening. -Ok.

426
00:26:20,777 --> 00:26:22,688
And Ankur too. -See you. -Bye.

427
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:47,976
<i>Wow!</i>

428
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,815
Let's go.

429
00:26:52,943 --> 00:26:55,787
Girl, you look so pretty.

430
00:26:57,247 --> 00:27:01,161
You're the sweetest thing
I've ever seen.

431
00:27:08,725 --> 00:27:12,935
Hey!
- Granny, your Cafe is really cool.

432
00:27:12,996 --> 00:27:15,977
My son has grown so big.

433
00:27:16,233 --> 00:27:17,735
This is for you.

434
00:27:25,809 --> 00:27:27,049
Pamper.

435
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:29,954
Child, you told me to pamper me.
Now wear it.

436
00:27:34,951 --> 00:27:36,988
This is Mr. Sharma.
I gave you home loan.

437
00:27:37,053 --> 00:27:38,623
Tell me if you need more loan.

438
00:27:38,688 --> 00:27:39,962
No, thank you.

439
00:27:40,757 --> 00:27:42,737
They'll ask even a dying
man if he needs loan.

440
00:27:42,959 --> 00:27:44,267
Sir, your order please.

441
00:27:45,295 --> 00:27:47,172
We've ordered.
You place the order.

442
00:27:47,697 --> 00:27:49,108
I've have a large salad. Spicy.

443
00:27:49,332 --> 00:27:51,039
0k. -Got to be edible. -Ok.

444
00:27:51,268 --> 00:27:53,680
Thank you. -Salad. -Yeah.

445
00:27:54,271 --> 00:27:56,376
Sifa of 41 died of a massive
heart attack.

446
00:27:57,173 --> 00:28:00,677
India is number one
in Cholesterol.

447
00:28:01,111 --> 00:28:02,920
So better safe than sorry.

448
00:28:12,055 --> 00:28:13,625
Don't you feel it's strange.

449
00:28:14,124 --> 00:28:17,196
These days we've to ask
question to talk.

450
00:28:18,762 --> 00:28:19,968
Sorry.

451
00:28:23,266 --> 00:28:25,906
Hey. You know what. I
forgot to tell you.

452
00:28:26,169 --> 00:28:28,649
I went to meet your aunt Dilshad
in her Cafe today.

453
00:28:29,306 --> 00:28:31,115
My company wants to buy her Cafe.

454
00:28:31,341 --> 00:28:33,321
They've offered her a serious
amount of money.

455
00:28:34,744 --> 00:28:36,280
I too tried to explain to her..

456
00:28:36,346 --> 00:28:38,223
...but she just doesn't understand.

457
00:28:39,015 --> 00:28:40,323
Silly. Very silly.

458
00:28:42,052 --> 00:28:43,588
You know, you should talk to her.

459
00:28:43,653 --> 00:28:45,655
Maybe she'll understand.
Or she'll lose out.

460
00:28:46,623 --> 00:28:49,001
Blue Bells are ready to
pay 35 Crore rupees.

461
00:28:49,626 --> 00:28:51,902
What? -Yes. Seriously. 35 Crore.

462
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:56,067
And this was..
- You order, madam. -Thanks.

463
00:28:57,867 --> 00:29:00,074
Sir, your salad.
- Thank you. -Spicy.

464
00:29:02,305 --> 00:29:04,046
I thought this was
a family outing.

465
00:29:05,842 --> 00:29:08,152
But for you family
is business too.

466
00:29:08,578 --> 00:29:11,559
I don't believe this, Anita.
Why do you jump to conclusions?

467
00:29:22,826 --> 00:29:28,640
Look. I'm doing this for your
aunt Dilshad's profit.

468
00:29:29,232 --> 00:29:32,145
35 Crore is hell of a lot
of money. She can retire.

469
00:29:32,836 --> 00:29:35,783
And then if I don't offer her,
someone else will.

470
00:29:36,005 --> 00:29:37,848
Will you be upset even then.
- Stop it, Amit.

471
00:29:37,907 --> 00:29:39,716
Please. -What do you mean..

472
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:43,120
What the hell do you think you're
doing? -I'll take care.

473
00:29:43,179 --> 00:29:44,852
It's ok. -He's a kid. It happens.

474
00:29:44,914 --> 00:29:46,723
If he's a kid,
he should behave like one.

475
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:49,958
He sits in the library of aunt
Dilshad for the whole day.

476
00:29:50,019 --> 00:29:52,625
He should be out playing.
- It's ok. Don't create a scene.

477
00:29:53,556 --> 00:29:56,093
From tomorrow you won't go to aunt
Dilshad's Cafe. You get it?

478
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:35,666
Mother.

479
00:30:38,001 --> 00:30:39,708
Mother. Father.

480
00:30:45,909 --> 00:30:48,150
Nice photograph!

481
00:31:03,626 --> 00:31:05,628
Hey, don't run like donkeys.

482
00:31:05,862 --> 00:31:07,239
Can't you see? -Sorry.

483
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:08,938
Can I help you, madam?

484
00:31:09,365 --> 00:31:11,242
Can I help you? -Yes, sure.

485
00:31:12,268 --> 00:31:13,975
Thank you.
- You're most welcome, madam.

486
00:31:14,604 --> 00:31:16,106
You don't seem to be from around.

487
00:31:16,372 --> 00:31:18,181
You're very gentleman.
- I'm from Dehraddun.

488
00:31:18,675 --> 00:31:20,814
I've come to Mumbai for a year
for Mass Communication.

489
00:31:20,977 --> 00:31:23,981
And then army.
- Mass Comm or for movies?

490
00:31:32,755 --> 00:31:33,961
No whistling in the Cafe.

491
00:31:34,023 --> 00:31:36,196
Jimmy can't you read English.
Keep your feet down.

492
00:31:36,259 --> 00:31:37,636
I said sorry.

493
00:31:37,694 --> 00:31:42,837
Good morning, everybody.
- What's that place?

494
00:31:43,199 --> 00:31:47,113
Which is this strange feeling?

495
00:31:47,403 --> 00:31:49,383
It was by Jagjit Singh.
I love Jagjit Singh.

496
00:31:50,173 --> 00:31:51,379
Asha Bhosale.

497
00:31:51,608 --> 00:31:52,882
But I love Jagjit Singh.

498
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:55,250
What will you've?

499
00:31:55,311 --> 00:31:56,654
It's free for you today.

500
00:31:56,713 --> 00:31:58,852
Really? -For being such a good
gentleman. -Thank you, madam.

501
00:31:58,915 --> 00:32:00,155
By the way, I've money.

502
00:32:01,017 --> 00:32:02,360
If I could get a liter of milk.

503
00:32:02,852 --> 00:32:05,298
Milk is best in every season.
Drink milk for healthy reason.

504
00:32:05,655 --> 00:32:07,965
I like that.
- We give milk by glass not liters.

505
00:32:08,024 --> 00:32:10,630
Then give me 4 glasses.
- Hot or cold? -Hot.

506
00:32:10,827 --> 00:32:13,637
With cream or without cream?
- Milk should've cream.

507
00:32:13,696 --> 00:32:14,731
Anything else?

508
00:32:15,098 --> 00:32:18,238
Manik. -Something else?
- Put chocolate powder.

509
00:32:18,301 --> 00:32:20,008
How many spoons? -Manik.

510
00:32:20,236 --> 00:32:22,079
I don't care.
I'll give you the entire bottle.

511
00:32:22,338 --> 00:32:23,874
He has gone crazy.

512
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:28,082
Which is this place? Our..

513
00:32:40,156 --> 00:32:42,102
Hey, aunt. How are you, guys?

514
00:32:42,158 --> 00:32:45,105
Wow. -Gorgeous. -It's bee
so long. -Welcome.

515
00:32:45,161 --> 00:32:47,732
I'm so sorry. I couldn't come
here after I return.

516
00:32:47,797 --> 00:32:48,775
I was busy with editing.

517
00:32:48,831 --> 00:32:50,970
And Salman wanted to see me.
- Salman. My favorite.

518
00:32:51,267 --> 00:32:53,747
Did he remove his shirt like this?

519
00:32:53,903 --> 00:32:57,077
Of course.
He's so cool and so misunderstood.

520
00:32:57,140 --> 00:33:00,087
Oh! This is for you.
And Manik. -Thank you.

521
00:33:00,343 --> 00:33:04,223
Look, Salman has sent autographed
T-shirt for you. -Wow.

522
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:07,352
Wow! -And kisses too. -Kisses?

523
00:33:07,984 --> 00:33:11,693
Puppy. -Mr. Vikramjit. Hold it.

524
00:33:12,155 --> 00:33:16,763
Give me burger.
In Switzerland. -Talk to me too.

525
00:33:18,227 --> 00:33:21,333
Whatever.
Guys. Did Raghav come here?

526
00:33:21,564 --> 00:33:22,804
Raghav disappeared once you left.

527
00:33:22,865 --> 00:33:25,812
Oh my God! But I love the way
you're looking. -Thank you.

528
00:33:25,868 --> 00:33:29,042
Hey, Mickey.
- What a life you lead!

529
00:33:29,105 --> 00:33:31,779
You stay with Shahrukh all
day long. 'Babuska'..

530
00:33:32,208 --> 00:33:33,653
Burger.

531
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:36,212
I'm Salman without muscle.

532
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:39,987
You wrote great lines. Amazing.

533
00:33:40,183 --> 00:33:42,288
I write. But Priety Zinta says it.

534
00:33:43,152 --> 00:33:46,656
She won't say without you.
You're the ad queen.

535
00:33:46,889 --> 00:33:50,860
Excuse me, Miss Salini. This..

536
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,764
Did you wrote the line 'Babuska'.

537
00:33:53,663 --> 00:33:56,234
I mean this is why advertising
has fascinated me.

538
00:33:56,299 --> 00:33:58,677
You sell dreams to people
in 15 seconds.

539
00:33:58,968 --> 00:34:01,710
It's.. I mean what were
you thinking, madam..

540
00:34:01,771 --> 00:34:05,116
...when you were writing 'Babuska'.
- Shalini.

541
00:34:06,876 --> 00:34:08,617
Miss Salini.

542
00:34:09,612 --> 00:34:10,955
Who are you?

543
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,351
Fresher. From army family.

544
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:17,222
Ah! Fresher.

545
00:34:17,286 --> 00:34:19,892
Yes, madam. -Fresher in Ad.

546
00:34:19,956 --> 00:34:24,132
Kid. -What are you doing?
Madam, leave the pants.

547
00:34:25,361 --> 00:34:29,002
I am bad.
So bad. Don't mess with me, boy.

548
00:34:29,298 --> 00:34:34,043
You aren't so hot and I don't
want to be your toy.

549
00:34:42,011 --> 00:34:44,218
Prince of words.

550
00:34:45,882 --> 00:34:48,658
Listen to me.

551
00:34:50,019 --> 00:34:52,693
There are many flirts
in the city.

552
00:34:54,057 --> 00:34:56,901
...but they run away from me.

553
00:34:58,394 --> 00:35:01,671
I am bad.
So bad. Don't mess with me, boy.

554
00:35:02,165 --> 00:35:06,636
You aren't so hot and I don't
want to be your toy.

555
00:35:06,703 --> 00:35:10,583
I am a lean machine.
They say I'm one of a kind.

556
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:14,110
You should be a real big shot
if you want to be my man.

557
00:35:14,677 --> 00:35:16,953
You aren't the kind
of guy for me.

558
00:35:17,013 --> 00:35:19,994
When I saw you..

559
00:35:20,817 --> 00:35:23,798
...my heart pines.

560
00:35:24,921 --> 00:35:28,869
It craves for you. It loves you.

561
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:33,763
The boys of the city are strange!

562
00:35:35,198 --> 00:35:37,974
They are all lovers at heart.

563
00:35:39,235 --> 00:35:41,772
They beg me..

564
00:35:43,306 --> 00:35:47,652
...at every corner. -No.

565
00:35:48,044 --> 00:35:51,218
You.. are you talking to me?

566
00:35:51,681 --> 00:35:55,390
You aren't my kind.
Don't try to make your move.

567
00:35:55,618 --> 00:35:59,395
I am no less, look at me too.

568
00:35:59,856 --> 00:36:03,531
I am no less, look at me too.

569
00:36:04,193 --> 00:36:06,833
I don't remember her address.

570
00:36:08,264 --> 00:36:11,177
I've forgotten everything
since I saw you.

571
00:36:12,135 --> 00:36:16,242
I just know that you're my
Juliet and I'm your Romeo.

572
00:36:18,808 --> 00:36:22,312
You.. are you talking to me?

573
00:36:22,545 --> 00:36:26,015
I am no less, look at me too.

574
00:36:26,582 --> 00:36:30,997
You aren't so hot.
- I'm no less, look at me too.

575
00:36:31,053 --> 00:36:33,363
I don't want to be your toy.

576
00:36:35,057 --> 00:36:37,833
I am bad.

577
00:36:39,695 --> 00:36:41,971
Stop. Stop. Lucky Cafe.

578
00:36:42,365 --> 00:36:44,311
So we're getting the place, right?

579
00:36:44,367 --> 00:36:46,677
Amit,
what happened about this place?

580
00:36:46,969 --> 00:36:49,848
Are we getting it? -I'm working
on it, sir. We'll get it.

581
00:36:52,241 --> 00:36:53,845
Amit. -Yes, sir.

582
00:36:54,143 --> 00:36:56,089
Yeah, David.
Very soon. -Right, sir.

583
00:36:56,345 --> 00:36:57,824
Right, sir. -Great!

584
00:37:00,783 --> 00:37:02,558
Hey! -Stupid.

585
00:37:08,124 --> 00:37:10,104
Hey! -Right on, man.

586
00:37:12,128 --> 00:37:14,938
Is this the place to ride a cycle?
- You're walking on the road.

587
00:37:14,997 --> 00:37:16,806
Walk on the pavement.

588
00:37:17,099 --> 00:37:18,908
You'll teach me where to walk.

589
00:37:18,968 --> 00:37:21,949
Ride cycle at home or park.
- Take it easy, mate.

590
00:37:22,138 --> 00:37:23,674
Mate. I'm not your mate.

591
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:25,813
Give it to me. -Granny.

592
00:37:25,875 --> 00:37:28,719
Granny! -It got drenched! -Granny!

593
00:37:28,978 --> 00:37:31,959
Take it easy, mate. Idiot.

594
00:37:40,623 --> 00:37:44,070
Madam. Sorry, madam. Actually
about weekend shooting..

595
00:37:44,126 --> 00:37:46,106
...I want to..
- Where is your project, Shalini?

596
00:37:46,362 --> 00:37:49,605
Your attendance is very low. -You
know last date is approaching.

597
00:37:49,665 --> 00:37:51,872
Madam, I would've submitted
the project but Jimmy..

598
00:37:51,934 --> 00:37:54,813
You want to buy project from
Jimmy. -Good morning, madam.

599
00:37:55,104 --> 00:37:58,210
Hello.
- Madam. Actually.. -Look, Shalini.

600
00:37:58,875 --> 00:38:00,980
If I don't get the project
before final assessment..

601
00:38:01,244 --> 00:38:03,690
...then..
- I know, madam. I'll lose my year.

602
00:38:03,746 --> 00:38:05,885
Correct. And stay away from Jimmy.

603
00:38:05,948 --> 00:38:07,791
Sure, madam.
- He only spells trouble. -Yes.

604
00:38:08,084 --> 00:38:12,760
What? -Yes, madam. Project of
Indian heritage. -Madam.

605
00:38:12,822 --> 00:38:16,235
After seeing Lucky Cafe I got an
idea that on heritage site..

606
00:38:16,292 --> 00:38:18,101
...we should make audio-visual
presentation.

607
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,696
How is it? -Not a bad idea.

608
00:38:20,096 --> 00:38:21,575
Very good, Vikramjit.

609
00:38:21,731 --> 00:38:23,335
And Shalini can help you. -Me?

610
00:38:23,666 --> 00:38:25,145
She knows Mumbai better
than others.

611
00:38:25,601 --> 00:38:27,239
Right? -Sure, madam. -Good.

612
00:38:28,304 --> 00:38:29,715
Project. -Yes, madam.

613
00:38:30,106 --> 00:38:31,847
Our work is done.

614
00:38:32,241 --> 00:38:35,984
Look, kid. Don't try to act
smart with me. Got it?

615
00:38:36,579 --> 00:38:37,922
I won't help you.

616
00:38:38,714 --> 00:38:41,194
Come on. Now get lost.

617
00:38:42,051 --> 00:38:45,692
What? We should help each other.
What's the problem?

618
00:38:46,622 --> 00:38:49,603
0k. Can you bring my project
back from Jimmy?

619
00:38:50,059 --> 00:38:51,663
No. -So?

620
00:38:52,061 --> 00:38:54,598
What help then? Now buzz off.

621
00:38:57,166 --> 00:39:00,306
'Buzz off'. -Hey, kid.

622
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:02,608
Why are you standing here?
'buzz off'.

623
00:39:02,672 --> 00:39:05,084
Brother, what does it mean? -What
is 'Buzz off'? -I'll tell you.

624
00:39:17,253 --> 00:39:19,733
Is he the same fellow?

625
00:39:21,257 --> 00:39:24,204
4. 43.

626
00:39:29,732 --> 00:39:31,211
Hello. -What do you want?

627
00:39:31,901 --> 00:39:33,574
What manners!

628
00:39:34,136 --> 00:39:36,343
That is my grandson's cycle.

629
00:39:36,739 --> 00:39:38,309
Do you know what your
grandson did?

630
00:39:39,241 --> 00:39:40,811
Demented.

631
00:39:42,111 --> 00:39:43,647
What did he do?

632
00:39:50,019 --> 00:39:52,295
Look. This is my parents' snap.

633
00:39:52,922 --> 00:39:54,367
Yes. -Only two.. look. -Very nice.

634
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:58,868
That day your grandson knocked
me down and it got drenched.

635
00:40:00,096 --> 00:40:01,939
Now who can rectify it?

636
00:40:02,231 --> 00:40:03,835
I can do it. -You can't.

637
00:40:03,899 --> 00:40:07,244
On top of that he teaches
me how to walk on roads.

638
00:40:07,737 --> 00:40:09,045
Take it easy, mate. Stupid!

639
00:40:10,773 --> 00:40:12,753
Don't call him stupid. He's a kid.

640
00:40:12,808 --> 00:40:14,947
He has no manners.
Family has no manners.

641
00:40:15,011 --> 00:40:18,151
Family.. -That day you broke
the bottle.. -No, no.

642
00:40:18,214 --> 00:40:19,693
0k. Now go.

643
00:40:20,049 --> 00:40:21,255
Don't you've any brains?

644
00:40:21,684 --> 00:40:24,688
I mean, doesn't size matter?
Your size and his size?

645
00:40:24,754 --> 00:40:26,665
He's a kid. Forgive him.

646
00:40:26,722 --> 00:40:29,259
Why? -Please. Return his cycle.
- No. He won't get the cycle.

647
00:40:29,325 --> 00:40:31,066
Complain to the police.
Do whatever you want.

648
00:40:31,127 --> 00:40:33,733
Now doesn't matter. You go.
- Mr. Subramaniyam, he's a child.

649
00:40:33,796 --> 00:40:35,798
You.. don't you get it?

650
00:40:40,169 --> 00:40:41,671
Hey, Subramaniyam. BA, LLB.

651
00:40:43,906 --> 00:40:45,977
If you keep this closed,
how will you get fresh air?

652
00:41:30,019 --> 00:41:32,625
Come, Mrs. Pandey.

653
00:41:32,688 --> 00:41:35,794
0k. -Welcome. What do you want?

654
00:41:35,858 --> 00:41:37,860
Yes. -Actually it's late..
- Should I lie down?

655
00:41:38,594 --> 00:41:40,198
Your eyes are beautiful. Really?

656
00:41:40,262 --> 00:41:42,037
Beautiful eyes. -Really?

657
00:41:42,264 --> 00:41:43,766
Oh no!

658
00:41:43,833 --> 00:41:45,779
Close your eyes, Mrs. Pandey.
I'll be back.

659
00:41:47,403 --> 00:41:48,973
Nice game.

660
00:41:52,408 --> 00:41:54,012
Where did he go?

661
00:41:56,278 --> 00:41:57,780
Jimmy.

662
00:41:59,215 --> 00:42:00,421
Jimmy.

663
00:42:02,718 --> 00:42:05,062
Jimmy, come or I'll open my eyes.

664
00:42:12,995 --> 00:42:15,032
Out!
I don't want to hear a word more.

665
00:42:15,097 --> 00:42:17,737
Out. Please, sir. -You won't tell
me who brought the aunt.

666
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,802
I didn't. -Get out I said. -But..

667
00:42:19,869 --> 00:42:23,373
Throw him outwith luggage.
- I didn't do it. -Come.

668
00:42:23,739 --> 00:42:26,720
I didn't do anything.
- Your arrival time wasn't right.

669
00:42:26,775 --> 00:42:29,119
Which time? Go to hell!
Nab the one who brought her.

670
00:42:29,345 --> 00:42:32,121
Who brought her? -I don't know.

671
00:42:37,853 --> 00:42:40,060
I appreciate you. You've guts.

672
00:42:40,789 --> 00:42:43,736
Neither age should be a limit..

673
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:48,103
...when one falls in love.

674
00:42:48,164 --> 00:42:49,609
Jagjit Singh.

675
00:42:50,032 --> 00:42:51,375
Did you like the aunt?

676
00:42:52,601 --> 00:42:54,046
Why are you sitting
with long face?

677
00:42:54,103 --> 00:42:55,844
You're expelled from hostel,
not college.

678
00:42:58,941 --> 00:43:00,215
You're showing attitude.

679
00:43:00,276 --> 00:43:02,654
0k, I'll send this letter
to your Brigadier father.

680
00:43:02,711 --> 00:43:05,317
I'll send it to dispatch clerk
and take my bribe back.

681
00:43:05,548 --> 00:43:07,152
Why to Brigadier..

682
00:43:07,216 --> 00:43:11,665
I wasn't inhibited by the
society" -I like Jagjit Singh.

683
00:43:12,121 --> 00:43:15,034
That's Pankaj Udas.
- Don't be sad. I've the letter.

684
00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:18,663
Jimmy, come on. Army..

685
00:43:20,162 --> 00:43:23,871
I'm stuck.
What a city! Everyone is crook.

686
00:43:29,371 --> 00:43:34,081
So much for the girl of this
file.. nice. Age no bar..

687
00:43:50,092 --> 00:43:51,765
Good morning, sir.
- Give me the milk.

688
00:44:03,138 --> 00:44:05,175
What is it?
- He's here as paying guest.

689
00:44:06,141 --> 00:44:07,620
Jimmy. -Vikramjit Singh, sir.

690
00:44:07,943 --> 00:44:09,183
Show me your bag.

691
00:44:09,912 --> 00:44:11,755
Sir, I've checked it. -Shut up!

692
00:44:12,548 --> 00:44:14,926
Open the bag. -Do it.

693
00:44:16,051 --> 00:44:17,325
What is inside?

694
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,300
Books. -What else?

695
00:44:22,858 --> 00:44:24,201
He's mad.. -Fine.

696
00:44:31,767 --> 00:44:33,110
Look at the cycle.

697
00:44:41,844 --> 00:44:43,221
Who is the paying guest?

698
00:44:43,779 --> 00:44:45,019
He's.. -I'm the one, sir.

699
00:44:45,948 --> 00:44:47,757
How can I be sure that
you're not a goon?

700
00:44:47,983 --> 00:44:49,223
He's from a good family.

701
00:44:49,985 --> 00:44:51,828
I didn't ask you.
I'm talking to you.

702
00:44:52,087 --> 00:44:53,327
You just keep quiet.

703
00:44:53,689 --> 00:44:55,066
Go and close the door.

704
00:44:56,258 --> 00:44:57,760
Where is your moustache?

705
00:44:59,194 --> 00:45:01,834
How can I know that
you're good or bad?

706
00:45:02,097 --> 00:45:03,576
He's good, sir. -Yes.

707
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:05,943
Good.

708
00:45:06,335 --> 00:45:07,871
I'm a very dangerous man.

709
00:45:09,872 --> 00:45:11,180
No guests for paying guest.

710
00:45:12,141 --> 00:45:13,347
Rs. 5000 rent.

711
00:45:13,842 --> 00:45:16,015
You've to eat one time
a day with me. Come.

712
00:45:17,012 --> 00:45:18,320
I'll check it. Come.

713
00:45:20,683 --> 00:45:22,822
Don't go in that room. It's mine.

714
00:45:23,319 --> 00:45:25,993
This will be yours.
- Cycle is of grandson.

715
00:45:26,055 --> 00:45:27,329
What did he say? -Sorry, sir.

716
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:29,760
I don't like sorry. -Right, uncle.

717
00:45:29,992 --> 00:45:32,097
Darn well I'm right.
And I'm not your uncle.

718
00:45:32,361 --> 00:45:34,170
No sorry. No uncle. Remember that.

719
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:36,038
I want to darn today, sir.

720
00:45:36,298 --> 00:45:37,902

00:45:42,738 --> 00:45:44,308
501. Is it token? -Just..

722
00:45:44,873 --> 00:45:46,682
Give me advance for two months.
Rs. 10,000.

723
00:45:48,010 --> 00:45:49,990
We didn't the money order.
We'll get it soon.

724
00:45:50,045 --> 00:45:53,117
Come when you get it. -When they
were going to send money order..

725
00:45:53,182 --> 00:45:54,388
...they found out that his mother..

726
00:45:54,616 --> 00:45:56,220
What happened to mother? -Attack.

727
00:45:56,618 --> 00:45:58,996
I'm talking to him not to you.
Keep quiet. Get out.

728
00:45:59,355 --> 00:46:01,232
Stand outside.
What happened to mother?

729
00:46:01,657 --> 00:46:03,193
You should be with her right now.

730
00:46:03,759 --> 00:46:05,238
What are you doing here?

731
00:46:06,095 --> 00:46:10,703
I'm in trouble, sir. -Me too. So
bring the remaining amount.

732
00:46:12,034 --> 00:46:14,878
Give me your photograph and
proof of permanent address.

733
00:46:15,304 --> 00:46:16,874
I'll bring the luggage, sir. -Ok.

734
00:46:16,939 --> 00:46:18,850
You've to clean the room yourself.
- Yes, sir.

735
00:46:18,907 --> 00:46:21,183
Go. And try to keep moustache
if possible. Idiot. -Yes.

736
00:46:25,047 --> 00:46:27,823
Guys, have you read the
latest headline or not?

737
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:31,197
Army boy caught in Jimmy's
room with aunt.

738
00:46:31,253 --> 00:46:32,630
Well.. well..

739
00:46:32,688 --> 00:46:34,565
If he stays with Jimmy,
what else will happen?

740
00:46:34,723 --> 00:46:36,202
Exactly. -Poor kid.

741
00:46:36,692 --> 00:46:38,569
He got stuck before
seeing the city.

742
00:46:39,228 --> 00:46:41,333
And he got lost in aunt's affair.

743
00:46:42,131 --> 00:46:43,667
Please pay attention.

744
00:46:44,199 --> 00:46:47,271
My friend Bunty has
send this for you.

745
00:46:47,936 --> 00:46:49,847
This.. who is Bunty?

746
00:46:50,873 --> 00:46:53,114
Bunty? Vikramjit Singh.

747
00:46:53,175 --> 00:46:55,246
Oh my boy! What guts! Bag and all.

748
00:46:55,611 --> 00:46:57,613
Please don't open it.
God knows what's inside.

749
00:46:57,679 --> 00:46:59,158
'Pages of completion
of Assignments.'

750
00:46:59,214 --> 00:47:01,694
Dude, talk in Hindi.
- Project file.

751
00:47:01,850 --> 00:47:03,557
For Miss Shalini.

752
00:47:04,753 --> 00:47:06,198
Your file.

753
00:47:34,216 --> 00:47:35,661
What?

754
00:47:41,557 --> 00:47:43,127
What nonsense!

755
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:59,810
Cool. Cool.

756
00:48:00,342 --> 00:48:03,983
Granny says that if a boy
apologizes for his mistake..

757
00:48:04,046 --> 00:48:06,117
...Is a nice boy. So I'm sorry.

758
00:48:08,984 --> 00:48:10,895
Just a minute. Just a minute.

759
00:48:16,225 --> 00:48:19,695
More the anger bottled within us..

760
00:48:20,062 --> 00:48:23,566
...makes us hate others that much.

761
00:48:26,134 --> 00:48:27,340
Granny says this.

762
00:48:27,569 --> 00:48:29,981
Actually it was my mistake.
I'm sorry.

763
00:48:59,601 --> 00:49:02,878
More the anger bottled within us..

764
00:49:03,138 --> 00:49:06,608
...makes us hate others that much.

765
00:49:30,332 --> 00:49:32,539
Thanks, Mike. Sorry, sir.

766
00:49:33,168 --> 00:49:34,670
Thank you.

767
00:49:39,841 --> 00:49:41,286
Bl...

768
00:49:55,891 --> 00:49:57,165
What do you want?

769
00:49:58,060 --> 00:49:59,266
What do you want?

770
00:49:59,995 --> 00:50:01,201
I want to buy a book.

771
00:50:03,231 --> 00:50:06,178
It's inside.
Go in. No money required.

772
00:50:13,208 --> 00:50:15,210
Fish. Mutton.

773
00:50:15,777 --> 00:50:18,758
No. No. No home delivery.

774
00:50:20,782 --> 00:50:22,227
Yes. Go on.

775
00:50:22,884 --> 00:50:24,124
Yes. Ok fine.

776
00:50:27,723 --> 00:50:29,896
Dear, don't make excuse of books.

777
00:50:30,125 --> 00:50:31,604
Excuse of coffee is better.

778
00:50:32,327 --> 00:50:34,933
Manik, bring coffee. -Ok.

779
00:50:35,197 --> 00:50:37,336
Special. -It's no excuse.

780
00:50:38,367 --> 00:50:42,042
After my mother's coffee,
I don't like other's coffee.

781
00:50:42,904 --> 00:50:46,408
We should file case against those
who call brown water coffee.

782
00:50:46,908 --> 00:50:49,115
It's an insult to coffee.

783
00:50:49,645 --> 00:50:52,319
0k, drink it. Please drink it.

784
00:50:53,415 --> 00:50:55,725
Drink it. It's special.

785
00:50:56,418 --> 00:50:57,988
You'll get discount too.

786
00:51:02,858 --> 00:51:04,337
Hmm! Now I've to hire a lawyer.

787
00:51:05,293 --> 00:51:08,069
No, it's good. But I make better.

788
00:51:08,296 --> 00:51:09,832
So teach me.

789
00:51:09,898 --> 00:51:12,139
I mean if you've time.
- Look, madam.. -Dilshad.

790
00:51:12,367 --> 00:51:14,244
Dilshad. -Yes, whatever.

791
00:51:15,037 --> 00:51:16,983
You know why I came here.

792
00:51:17,239 --> 00:51:20,277
Yes. To return the cycle. -No.

793
00:51:21,843 --> 00:51:24,187
I came to do what I didn't
do for the past 30 years.

794
00:51:24,713 --> 00:51:27,387
I read what you sent to me
with your grandson's hand.

795
00:51:27,849 --> 00:51:29,851
You rack up fights. -What..

796
00:51:29,918 --> 00:51:33,127
That day also you broke the bottle
and unnecessarily started fight.

797
00:51:33,321 --> 00:51:34,994
I don't want to talk
about anything.

798
00:51:35,057 --> 00:51:36,365
I don't want these books. Ok?

799
00:51:37,626 --> 00:51:38,730
He's changing.

800
00:51:39,628 --> 00:51:42,006
You know when Romans used
to win battles..

801
00:51:42,064 --> 00:51:45,375
...they used to celebrate by
burning the nearby villages.

802
00:51:46,101 --> 00:51:47,671
Nine down. One to go.

803
00:51:48,003 --> 00:51:50,313
What about aunt? -Sir, that..

804
00:51:50,372 --> 00:51:53,251
You know, Amit. Let me make one thing
very clear to you. It's like bungee jump.

805
00:51:54,176 --> 00:51:56,122
If you jump once,
you can't stop yourself.

806
00:51:56,411 --> 00:51:57,947
Either you're up or you're down.

807
00:51:58,747 --> 00:52:00,385
And in your case,
I want you to stay up.

808
00:52:01,416 --> 00:52:02,759
You know time is changing.

809
00:52:02,818 --> 00:52:05,196
Everyone is moving ahead.
Nobody has time for others.

810
00:52:05,721 --> 00:52:07,667
You got to move on.
You're a good worker, Amit.

811
00:52:08,190 --> 00:52:10,261
Friend, talk to aunt.

812
00:52:10,592 --> 00:52:12,868
I mean use pressure, money.
Do something.

813
00:52:14,129 --> 00:52:15,972
Amit, you're my man.

814
00:52:16,732 --> 00:52:18,370
You can do it.
And I don't want to lose you.

815
00:52:22,370 --> 00:52:24,111
Hello.
- Hello, sir. This is Mr. Sharma.

816
00:52:24,773 --> 00:52:26,946
Do you want more loan?
- If you phone again..

817
00:52:27,943 --> 00:52:30,856
...I'll get in the phone
and thrash you. Got it?

818
00:52:39,221 --> 00:52:40,791
Hello, Miss Shalini.

819
00:52:45,627 --> 00:52:47,163
What? -it's..

820
00:52:48,096 --> 00:52:51,270
What, kid?
Do you think you're smart?

821
00:52:52,267 --> 00:52:54,247
Are you trying to earn some
brownie points here?

822
00:52:55,070 --> 00:52:56,913
Ah.. -Hello. I'm talking to you.

823
00:52:57,739 --> 00:52:59,719
You didn't need to do this for me.

824
00:53:00,976 --> 00:53:03,013
And I can handle that Jimmy. Ok?

825
00:53:04,045 --> 00:53:07,583
Ah.. so you came to say this. -So?

826
00:53:08,583 --> 00:53:10,153
0k, fine.
I won't do it next time. -What?

827
00:53:11,987 --> 00:53:14,228
Look, if you feel that
I came to thank you..

828
00:53:14,756 --> 00:53:16,667
...then you're sadly mistaken.
I'll never happen.

829
00:53:16,858 --> 00:53:18,997
Because my dictionary doesn't
have the word 'Thank you'.

830
00:53:19,127 --> 00:53:21,334
As for the score,
I'll score it equal.

831
00:53:21,797 --> 00:53:23,333
All right. -You're strange.

832
00:53:24,666 --> 00:53:26,373
One landlord has problem
with sorry..

833
00:53:26,601 --> 00:53:28,205
...and you're angry with thank you.

834
00:53:29,137 --> 00:53:30,775
What is this? -Whatever.

835
00:53:30,839 --> 00:53:33,820
Watchman!
Change the light of the corridor.

836
00:53:35,310 --> 00:53:38,587
Leave me! -You just salute.
You don't do much work.

837
00:53:39,381 --> 00:53:40,883
Idiot! -Leave..

838
00:53:44,085 --> 00:53:46,031
Madam, your file got me
expelled from there.

839
00:53:46,087 --> 00:53:49,193
You'll get me evicted from here.
Please keep quiet. -Vikram.

840
00:53:50,025 --> 00:53:51,231
Vikram. -Hello, sir.

841
00:53:53,061 --> 00:53:54,665
Why is the door open?

842
00:53:55,363 --> 00:53:57,365
Milkman had come, sir. -Now..

843
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,302
He got late today, sir.

844
00:54:01,069 --> 00:54:03,242
Late? -He came early today.

845
00:54:04,706 --> 00:54:06,652
What are you saying?
What do you want to say?

846
00:54:06,741 --> 00:54:09,347
He was late.
Today he was late, sir.

847
00:54:13,949 --> 00:54:16,930
These clothes are kept here.
Is this a house or a laundry?

848
00:54:17,085 --> 00:54:21,158
What have you done? -Nothing.
I'll clean it. You should rest.

849
00:54:22,290 --> 00:54:25,328
I mean it's your house.
You can do whatever you want.

850
00:54:26,795 --> 00:54:28,797
You look very handsome today, sir.

851
00:54:29,264 --> 00:54:32,575
Am I? -Yes, sir. Exercising"
- Close the door on your way out.

852
00:54:34,836 --> 00:54:38,215
I've got it, sir.
I've.. got it.. thank you, sir.

853
00:54:40,308 --> 00:54:41,946
He's a strange boy.

854
00:54:44,379 --> 00:54:48,054
Hey! -Come. Come here.

855
00:54:48,250 --> 00:54:50,025
Please come.

856
00:54:50,919 --> 00:54:53,160
Oh God! Have you gone mad?

857
00:54:54,155 --> 00:54:56,294
You twisted it. -Did you get hurt?

858
00:54:56,725 --> 00:55:00,070
Are you mad? -It's nothing.
Rub it and get to work.

859
00:55:01,296 --> 00:55:02,775
Do you always talk like that?

860
00:55:03,198 --> 00:55:06,338
What can I do? This is my thirst.

861
00:55:08,336 --> 00:55:09,838
One minute, madam.

862
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:15,349
A gift for someone in.. college.

863
00:55:19,114 --> 00:55:22,857
Thank you. -Will you take me
out to see the city now?

864
00:55:25,086 --> 00:55:26,963
I got your file.

865
00:55:27,889 --> 00:55:29,197
I've made it even.

866
00:55:30,025 --> 00:55:31,595
I saved you from the old man.

867
00:55:32,027 --> 00:55:34,769
Excuse me.
Rajeev Gopal Subramaniyam.

868
00:55:36,031 --> 00:55:38,705
Not old man. Ok?

869
00:55:40,769 --> 00:55:42,112
I'll think about it.

870
00:55:55,917 --> 00:55:58,761
I'd told you that guest isn't
allowed for the paying guest.

871
00:56:00,155 --> 00:56:01,657
Don't repeat this mistake.

872
00:56:02,590 --> 00:56:03,933
You want coffee.

873
00:56:04,893 --> 00:56:05,928
Yes, sir.

874
00:56:06,328 --> 00:56:09,605
Make for yourself and give me too.

875
00:56:14,102 --> 00:56:17,015
Papa, you've come to take me from
school for the first time.

876
00:56:17,272 --> 00:56:20,617
No, child.
Who came for your admission? Papa.

877
00:56:21,009 --> 00:56:23,353
Hey, come.
Let's spend the day together.

878
00:56:25,180 --> 00:56:26,784
Here we're. -Wow!

879
00:56:27,015 --> 00:56:30,724
Aunt Dilshad's case. -Yes. Today
papa has to do homework.

880
00:56:31,219 --> 00:56:33,699
Shall we? -Yes. -Let's go.

881
00:56:34,956 --> 00:56:38,028
Come on. Go get your books.
- Ankur. -Hi, aunt Dilshad.

882
00:56:38,660 --> 00:56:41,266
Chocolate for my prince.
- Thank you. -Hi, Amit.

883
00:56:42,197 --> 00:56:43,733
Son, you wanted books.

884
00:56:43,798 --> 00:56:46,677
Go get your books.
- I don't want it, papa.

885
00:56:46,835 --> 00:56:49,679
You said that you want
to do homework.

886
00:56:49,971 --> 00:56:51,348
Son.. you..

887
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:55,180
Come on. Go and check.
- Ankur, new comics have arrived.

888
00:56:55,243 --> 00:56:57,280
Go and check it.
- Thank you, aunt Dilshad.

889
00:57:07,122 --> 00:57:08,658
I know why you're here.

890
00:57:14,229 --> 00:57:15,867
This is a big city, Amit.

891
00:57:17,298 --> 00:57:19,539
Tell your company to find
some other place.

892
00:57:20,769 --> 00:57:21,873
Aunt.

893
00:57:24,272 --> 00:57:25,808
Lucky Cafe isn't for sale.

894
00:57:26,708 --> 00:57:28,210
Aunt, think again.

895
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:34,023
Fine. 45 Crore.

896
00:57:34,349 --> 00:57:38,263
And I'll keep a post for you.
- Is that ok now?

897
00:57:38,319 --> 00:57:40,663
How many times should I tell
you the same thing?

898
00:57:40,922 --> 00:57:42,196
You don't understand.

899
00:57:42,857 --> 00:57:44,268
Lucky Cafe isn't for sale.

900
00:57:46,995 --> 00:57:49,874
Look, Amit. You can come here.

901
00:57:50,198 --> 00:57:51,871
But now.. only as a guest.

902
00:57:53,234 --> 00:57:54,736
Yeah. Ankur.

903
00:57:55,036 --> 00:57:56,811
Yes, papa. -Son, get in the car.

904
00:57:57,639 --> 00:57:59,016
Hurry UP-

905
00:58:03,078 --> 00:58:05,251
Amit. Amit.

906
00:58:07,315 --> 00:58:08,817
Amit, I'm sorry.

907
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:12,955
Sorry.

908
00:58:14,556 --> 00:58:16,035
Even Anita and I met here.

909
00:58:18,026 --> 00:58:20,336
I too had many complaints
against you..

910
00:58:21,329 --> 00:58:22,808
...and from your Lucky Cafe.

911
00:58:23,765 --> 00:58:26,974
But still I return
here only for you.

912
00:58:28,002 --> 00:58:29,640
For your profit.

913
00:58:30,705 --> 00:58:32,776
To save you from my company.

914
00:58:33,808 --> 00:58:37,187
You've no clue what they can do,
aunt

915
00:58:38,079 --> 00:58:39,956
Oops! Sorry. Sorry.

916
00:58:40,181 --> 00:58:41,717
No, aunt.

917
00:58:42,317 --> 00:58:43,887
I'm a guest, right.

918
00:58:46,221 --> 00:58:47,256
Fine.

919
00:58:48,223 --> 00:58:49,293
Dilshad lrani.

920
00:58:49,357 --> 00:58:54,670
Henceforth you'll be responsible
for whatever happens here now.

921
00:58:56,131 --> 00:58:57,838
Lucky Cafe is gone.

922
00:58:58,133 --> 00:58:59,635
You've forty days.

923
00:59:00,668 --> 00:59:03,205
Save it. Save it. -Amit.

924
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:47,334
How much would you try?

925
00:59:47,759 --> 00:59:49,136
What else can I do?

926
00:59:51,329 --> 00:59:55,175
I was so happy when I bought
a flat of four bedrooms.

927
00:59:56,834 --> 01:00:00,873
I was scared too.
But now it's completely..

928
01:00:01,839 --> 01:00:02,874
Nagpal!

929
01:00:03,708 --> 01:00:04,880
King Cobra is scared.

930
01:00:05,076 --> 01:00:07,352
You're the CEO of the company.
- CEO.

931
01:00:07,779 --> 01:00:08,985
So what?

932
01:00:09,747 --> 01:00:13,024
What's real isn't evident and
what's evident isn't real.

933
01:00:13,718 --> 01:00:16,597
Now look at you.
Hotshot photographer.

934
01:00:16,854 --> 01:00:19,266
Can anyone fire you? No way.

935
01:00:20,024 --> 01:00:24,097
But you never knows when a new
kids come in the block and..

936
01:00:24,162 --> 01:00:25,732
...boom, you're out of your job.

937
01:00:26,130 --> 01:00:28,667
Let's break up the party boys.

938
01:00:38,943 --> 01:00:42,322
One will be replaced by other.

939
01:00:45,750 --> 01:00:49,254
Even without you the
show will go on.

940
01:00:52,690 --> 01:00:55,671
Don't be tense.

941
01:00:56,127 --> 01:00:59,301
This is life.

942
01:00:59,364 --> 01:01:03,039
Start your life from someplace..

943
01:01:03,101 --> 01:01:06,378
...without any worries.

944
01:01:06,604 --> 01:01:08,242
Grab it, friend.

945
01:01:08,306 --> 01:01:10,013
Grab what you want.

946
01:01:10,074 --> 01:01:12,111
Everything is up for a grab.

947
01:01:12,176 --> 01:01:13,883
Grab it, friend.

948
01:01:20,685 --> 01:01:23,063
What happened? You used to be
a big stud in the college.

949
01:01:24,122 --> 01:01:27,069
Has the king Cobra lost its charm?

950
01:01:27,892 --> 01:01:29,838
Friend, I've gone old. Look at it.

951
01:01:38,369 --> 01:01:45,844
There is dawn after every dusk.

952
01:01:47,111 --> 01:01:53,892
Every dawn ends with dusk.

953
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:58,230
What has to happen will happen.

954
01:01:59,157 --> 01:02:02,263
You will lose what you get.

955
01:02:02,694 --> 01:02:06,198
There are ups and downs in life.

956
01:02:06,264 --> 01:02:09,370
Both are waiting for you.

957
01:02:11,069 --> 01:02:13,140
Grab it, friend.

958
01:02:13,204 --> 01:02:14,979
Grab what you want.

959
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:16,882
Everything is up for a grab.

960
01:02:16,941 --> 01:02:18,682
Grab it, friend.

961
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:32,100
Grab it, friend.

962
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:37,364
Way to go, Cobra.

963
01:02:45,870 --> 01:02:48,111
Amit. Amit.

964
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:51,379
Terrible.
Electric bill has increased.

965
01:02:51,609 --> 01:02:54,146
Telephone bill has increased.
Rent has increased.

966
01:02:54,212 --> 01:02:58,024
Everything has increased.
But my pension is still the same.

967
01:02:58,082 --> 01:02:59,254
Why do you get tense?

968
01:02:59,317 --> 01:03:01,319
Stay peacefully upstairs.
- Mind your language.

969
01:03:01,552 --> 01:03:02,758
That house is mine. Got it?

970
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:05,061
I stay in my house.
- You eat for free.

971
01:03:05,256 --> 01:03:07,736
It's no use talking to you.
- Manik.

972
01:03:07,792 --> 01:03:09,203
Rodriguez.

973
01:03:09,761 --> 01:03:10,933
What did you say to him?

974
01:03:11,162 --> 01:03:12,698
Dilshad, I was just kidding.

975
01:03:12,930 --> 01:03:14,637
I told you not to joke with him.

976
01:03:15,133 --> 01:03:16,840
Now go away. Stupid.

977
01:03:18,669 --> 01:03:19,875
What?

978
01:03:19,971 --> 01:03:21,006
Look, Amit.

979
01:03:21,072 --> 01:03:23,814
You can do whatever you want
in your professional life.

980
01:03:25,209 --> 01:03:26,620
I can't say anything.

981
01:03:27,178 --> 01:03:28,714
But please..

982
01:03:28,913 --> 01:03:31,189
...keep your family away
from your business.

983
01:03:33,618 --> 01:03:35,620
What.. what do you mean?

984
01:03:36,287 --> 01:03:39,996
I mean you used Ankur to
reach aunt Dilshad.

985
01:03:40,224 --> 01:03:42,101
Ah.. -You bribed Ankur.

986
01:03:43,628 --> 01:03:45,005
What are you doing, Amit?

987
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:47,006
And what are you snatching me?

988
01:03:47,665 --> 01:03:49,008
What are you snatching from us?

989
01:03:49,667 --> 01:03:52,113
We started our lives there.
We met there, darn it!

990
01:03:55,139 --> 01:03:56,846
I'm not snatching anything
from anyone.

991
01:03:57,975 --> 01:03:59,613
If she doesn't give
her Cafe to us..

992
01:04:00,978 --> 01:04:02,651
...I'm bloody finished.

993
01:04:03,014 --> 01:04:04,118
That baldy..

994
01:04:06,784 --> 01:04:08,764
God.. Anita, this is business.

995
01:04:09,887 --> 01:04:12,766
If we don't buy it,
someone else will.

996
01:04:13,024 --> 01:04:15,163
How many people will you stop?

997
01:04:17,028 --> 01:04:20,271
Listen. We're paying her money.

998
01:04:20,665 --> 01:04:22,576
I'm not buying for free.
- Darn, the money!

999
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:26,947
When will you understand, Amit?

1000
01:04:27,672 --> 01:04:30,380
Money isn't enough to
be happy in life.

1001
01:04:31,576 --> 01:04:32,987
There is something called family.

1002
01:04:33,211 --> 01:04:35,384
You've us. Cherish us, Amit.

1003
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:37,086
Cherish us.

1004
01:04:38,216 --> 01:04:40,696
Cherish what?
And where is the family?

1005
01:04:40,918 --> 01:04:42,158
I don't see now family.

1006
01:04:42,854 --> 01:04:44,891
Oh! You mean you and I are family.

1007
01:04:46,390 --> 01:04:50,099
What have we done together
in past 4-5 years.

1008
01:04:51,929 --> 01:04:53,772
Wherever we go, 'Don't do this'..

1009
01:04:54,131 --> 01:04:57,010
Don't do that. Relax, friend.

1010
01:04:57,902 --> 01:04:59,245
Breathe. -Amit.

1011
01:05:00,037 --> 01:05:02,813
And let me breathe too. Ok?

1012
01:05:03,274 --> 01:05:04,878
No, Amit. -What do you want?

1013
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:09,751
That we should go to that one
bedroom flat. In that rat hole.

1014
01:05:11,549 --> 01:05:12,994
Darn! And of course..

1015
01:05:13,784 --> 01:05:16,264
...you weren't happy with me there.

1016
01:05:19,690 --> 01:05:20,896
What?

1017
01:05:21,626 --> 01:05:22,969
What?

1018
01:05:24,795 --> 01:05:26,001
God!

1019
01:05:27,198 --> 01:05:29,041
Now you've to go to
others for this.

1020
01:05:29,100 --> 01:05:31,603
Look..
listen. It's not what you think.

1021
01:05:33,104 --> 01:05:34,606
It's nothing.

1022
01:05:35,006 --> 01:05:37,282
You're sick.
- It's nothing like that.

1023
01:05:38,042 --> 01:05:39,350
You need help, Amit.

1024
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:44,052
Anita.

1025
01:05:44,582 --> 01:05:46,755
I've been stressed. You know.

1026
01:05:50,655 --> 01:05:51,929
I met Harry.

1027
01:05:54,659 --> 01:05:56,764
We went to club.
I even phoned you.

1028
01:05:57,061 --> 01:05:59,564
But you didn't answer
the phone as usual.

1029
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:06,978
We'd a drink.

1030
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:10,576
I danced.

1031
01:06:11,809 --> 01:06:13,720
But it's not what you think.

1032
01:06:20,918 --> 01:06:23,592
I didn't do anything. I promise.

1033
01:06:23,854 --> 01:06:24,992
Why not?

1034
01:06:25,923 --> 01:06:27,095
Yes.

1035
01:06:27,692 --> 01:06:29,069
Who stopped you?

1036
01:06:29,961 --> 01:06:31,668
You should've done
what you wanted.

1037
01:06:33,631 --> 01:06:37,044
Because I.. I'm a father of a son.

1038
01:06:38,903 --> 01:06:40,382
I'm a responsible man. You get it.

1039
01:06:44,775 --> 01:06:48,279
So your responsibility and
your love stopped you.

1040
01:06:49,313 --> 01:06:50,724
Yes, Anita.

1041
01:06:51,082 --> 01:06:54,529
Because I don't see love here.

1042
01:06:55,219 --> 01:06:56,630
Do you see it?

1043
01:06:57,622 --> 01:06:59,761
If we're just responsibilities
for you..

1044
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:04,200
...then I don't think..

1045
01:07:06,263 --> 01:07:08,265
...we should stay together.

1046
01:07:11,936 --> 01:07:13,540
Incomplete..

1047
01:07:15,006 --> 01:07:16,644
...desires..

1048
01:07:17,875 --> 01:07:21,049
...long to be fulfilled.

1049
01:07:23,047 --> 01:07:25,049
This heart"

1050
01:07:25,983 --> 01:07:28,020
...now wants freedom..

1051
01:07:29,020 --> 01:07:32,661
...from the fear of separation.

1052
01:07:33,758 --> 01:07:38,138
In a moment, I'll express..

1053
01:07:38,596 --> 01:07:42,134
...all the hidden feelings.

1054
01:07:45,136 --> 01:07:51,815
Let's meet first.

1055
01:07:54,812 --> 01:07:56,189
Aunt Dilshad.

1056
01:07:56,614 --> 01:07:58,616
Yes, son. What happened?

1057
01:07:59,984 --> 01:08:01,861
What happened? -I'm so sorry.

1058
01:08:02,253 --> 01:08:03,664
Did you fight with Amit?

1059
01:08:03,988 --> 01:08:08,300
Yes. Child, for small quarrels,
bags" -I've left the house.

1060
01:08:09,627 --> 01:08:11,629
Go inside.

1061
01:08:12,229 --> 01:08:13,708
I'll talk to him.

1062
01:08:14,999 --> 01:08:16,842
Go inside. Go. Go inside.

1063
01:08:16,901 --> 01:08:18,346
I'll talk to Amit. Go.

1064
01:08:18,569 --> 01:08:19,877
Go. Manik. -Yes?

1065
01:08:20,938 --> 01:08:22,349
Leave it. Take this.

1066
01:08:56,273 --> 01:08:57,650
Anita. -Amit.

1067
01:08:58,609 --> 01:08:59,815
Hey.. -What happened?

1068
01:09:00,978 --> 01:09:02,514
Why do you do this?

1069
01:09:03,714 --> 01:09:05,250
You snatched my wife.

1070
01:09:07,017 --> 01:09:08,587
And now my son too..

1071
01:09:09,620 --> 01:09:10,826
Why?

1072
01:09:12,089 --> 01:09:13,762
This is our personal life.

1073
01:09:14,558 --> 01:09:16,560
Personal.
Do you understand, lady? -Amit.

1074
01:09:17,194 --> 01:09:18,969
Hey. -Go home.

1075
01:09:19,764 --> 01:09:21,675
Please leave. Now.

1076
01:09:24,635 --> 01:09:26,012
I don't believe you.

1077
01:09:30,207 --> 01:09:32,278
It's not what you think.

1078
01:09:33,077 --> 01:09:35,683
Don't drag family problems
on the street. Ok?

1079
01:09:36,313 --> 01:09:39,226
I love you. Ok? Come.

1080
01:09:41,252 --> 01:09:42,697
Come with me.

1081
01:09:43,053 --> 01:09:45,329
Sorry. Let's go home.

1082
01:09:46,056 --> 01:09:47,364
Come.

1083
01:09:47,958 --> 01:09:49,301
Come.

1084
01:09:53,130 --> 01:09:54,837
You've brought it on the street,
Amit.

1085
01:09:57,768 --> 01:10:00,271
That house is yours, not mine.

1086
01:10:02,139 --> 01:10:04,642
So you go home, Amit.
Go to your house.

1087
01:10:05,109 --> 01:10:06,383
Anita, go home.

1088
01:10:06,610 --> 01:10:07,918
Go home, dear.

1089
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:10,954
You stay out of this. Ok?

1090
01:10:11,315 --> 01:10:13,158
No more of your sentimental
nonsense.

1091
01:10:20,624 --> 01:10:21,932
So you won.. sorry.

1092
01:10:23,661 --> 01:10:24,696
You..

1093
01:10:26,797 --> 01:10:28,299
You won't come to my house. Right?

1094
01:10:30,935 --> 01:10:31,970
Fine.

1095
01:10:32,803 --> 01:10:34,077
Fine.

1096
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:37,251
Happy?

1097
01:10:38,976 --> 01:10:41,252
Dilshad.
I'm really sorry for all this.

1098
01:10:42,012 --> 01:10:43,286
We'll leave tomorrow morning.

1099
01:10:44,381 --> 01:10:46,019
It's ok, dear. Go.

1100
01:10:46,717 --> 01:10:47,752
Go to Ankur.

1101
01:11:05,603 --> 01:11:12,817
One who gives the courage
of eternal love..

1102
01:11:13,911 --> 01:11:17,256
...gives the courage..

1103
01:11:18,282 --> 01:11:25,291
That same one gives the
fear of separation.

1104
01:11:26,390 --> 01:11:30,065
Fear of separation.

1105
01:11:30,995 --> 01:11:38,004
One who gives the courage
of eternal love..

1106
01:11:39,069 --> 01:11:42,881
...gives the courage..

1107
01:12:02,259 --> 01:12:09,609
Love fills the heart with
desire to soar high.

1108
01:12:12,770 --> 01:12:19,745
Love fills the heart with
desire to soar high.

1109
01:12:21,178 --> 01:12:28,392
And it even makes
my wings heavy.

1110
01:12:29,653 --> 01:12:37,094
One who gives the courage
of eternal love..

1111
01:12:37,728 --> 01:12:41,801
...gives the courage..

1112
01:12:57,715 --> 01:12:58,750
Mr. Mehta..

1113
01:12:58,816 --> 01:13:03,128
...as per the record, Mr. Zubin lrani, the
real owner of the Cafe died 30 years ago.

1114
01:13:03,954 --> 01:13:06,935
Before dying he didn't bequeathed
this Cafe to Dilshad Nanji.

1115
01:13:07,224 --> 01:13:08,259
Even if he did..

1116
01:13:08,325 --> 01:13:11,329
...that document won't be valid
as it wasn't registered.

1117
01:13:12,763 --> 01:13:16,677
After Zubin lrani, his family
should get his entire property.

1118
01:13:16,900 --> 01:13:18,743
But there is no record
of his family.

1119
01:13:18,802 --> 01:13:20,782
And since he didn't
marry so I say"

1120
01:13:20,838 --> 01:13:25,048
Mr. Sood, cut out this technicalities
and tell me when will I get this Cafe.

1121
01:13:25,109 --> 01:13:27,885
No. Mr. Mehta, it's not so easy.

1122
01:13:29,913 --> 01:13:33,861
Look. Dilshad Nanji isn't
the owner of that Cafe.

1123
01:13:34,284 --> 01:13:36,924
That's fine. But she can prove
herself to be tenant..

1124
01:13:37,221 --> 01:13:40,259
...by acquisition very easily.

1125
01:13:40,958 --> 01:13:42,266
Because as per our law..

1126
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:44,262
...If a property is
in under one's..

1127
01:13:44,328 --> 01:13:45,864
...control for more than 12 years..

1128
01:13:45,929 --> 01:13:48,068
...without any objection or claim..

1129
01:13:48,866 --> 01:13:51,346
...then it's very difficult
to vacate it.

1130
01:13:51,869 --> 01:13:53,075
Mr. Sood.

1131
01:13:54,338 --> 01:13:55,874
Zubin lrani had a brother too.

1132
01:13:58,809 --> 01:14:00,152
Dinshaw lrani.

1133
01:14:03,614 --> 01:14:06,185
We get him. We get the Cafe.

1134
01:14:12,890 --> 01:14:14,369
Oh God!

1135
01:14:19,063 --> 01:14:20,804
Don't stare. Open the door. -Wait.

1136
01:14:21,598 --> 01:14:22,941
Come. Come.

1137
01:14:30,107 --> 01:14:31,381
Subbu.

1138
01:14:32,342 --> 01:14:33,821
Welcome. -This is for you.

1139
01:14:34,178 --> 01:14:36,317
What's this?
It isn't my birthday today.

1140
01:14:37,314 --> 01:14:39,021
Did you shout? -No.

1141
01:14:39,316 --> 01:14:40,818
Did you grumble? -No.

1142
01:14:41,051 --> 01:14:42,394
Then it's birth of a new Subbu.

1143
01:14:43,253 --> 01:14:45,062
Happy birthday, Subbu.

1144
01:14:45,956 --> 01:14:47,299
Thank you. -Serve me coffee.

1145
01:14:48,926 --> 01:14:50,599
Just a minute.
Take off your slippers.

1146
01:14:50,794 --> 01:14:52,034
Wear that. -Sorry.

1147
01:15:11,348 --> 01:15:13,350
Subbu, you look like your father.

1148
01:15:15,819 --> 01:15:17,025
Thank you.

1149
01:15:18,822 --> 01:15:20,130
Look..

1150
01:15:21,358 --> 01:15:24,100
I tried it once.
Simple technology. Photoshop.

1151
01:15:24,862 --> 01:15:26,808
You said I can't do it.
Didn't I do it? See?

1152
01:15:28,632 --> 01:15:31,977
Yes. -This is called great coffee.

1153
01:15:32,603 --> 01:15:34,014
One sip and all worries disappear.

1154
01:15:34,271 --> 01:15:35,579
My mother taught me.

1155
01:15:35,906 --> 01:15:38,318
BA LLB, are you doctor too?

1156
01:15:39,243 --> 01:15:40,654
No. I'm LLB.

1157
01:15:41,044 --> 01:15:42,352
My mother was ill..

1158
01:15:43,147 --> 01:15:44,888
...so I used to read medical books.

1159
01:15:46,884 --> 01:15:48,158
Can I meet your mother?

1160
01:15:48,952 --> 01:15:50,260
You want to meet her? -Yes.

1161
01:15:50,821 --> 01:15:51,799
Come.

1162
01:15:58,195 --> 01:16:00,004
Mother passed 11 years ago.

1163
01:16:09,106 --> 01:16:10,346
Subbu. -Yes.

1164
01:16:12,342 --> 01:16:13,821
Yes, I was a kid too once.

1165
01:16:20,184 --> 01:16:21,686
You play violin.

1166
01:16:22,286 --> 01:16:23,856
Yes. I used to play for mother.

1167
01:16:24,321 --> 01:16:27,666
It eases pain.
- Then some.. come on.

1168
01:16:29,826 --> 01:16:31,066
Come on.

1169
01:16:32,095 --> 01:16:33,130
Come on.

1170
01:16:40,704 --> 01:16:42,149
You've been a good son, Subbu.

1171
01:16:43,340 --> 01:16:45,013
You love your mother so much.

1172
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:51,057
Lucky mother.

1173
01:17:17,241 --> 01:17:18,811
You may go. -What?

1174
01:17:22,212 --> 01:17:23,555
Please go.

1175
01:17:31,588 --> 01:17:33,590
Happy birthday to you.

1176
01:17:33,757 --> 01:17:36,499
Hey, clap! Happy birthday to you.

1177
01:17:37,027 --> 01:17:39,530
Happy birthday to you. -Bhim.

1178
01:17:39,797 --> 01:17:42,471
Did you give treat to
everyone outside?

1179
01:17:42,733 --> 01:17:44,735
Happy birthday to you.
Jagit Singh. -Mohammed Rafi.

1180
01:17:45,302 --> 01:17:47,805
I didn't know it was your happy
birthday today. -It's not mine..

1181
01:17:47,871 --> 01:17:50,442
...It's your girl for and your
to-be sister-in-law's birthday.

1182
01:17:50,507 --> 01:17:51,884
Did you wish her?

1183
01:17:55,679 --> 01:17:57,352
Today is Shalini's birthday.

1184
01:17:59,483 --> 01:18:04,455
Girls can't be impressed with
body and all these things.

1185
01:18:05,322 --> 01:18:06,733
Good looks and humor.

1186
01:18:07,124 --> 01:18:08,865
I've both so I'm telling you.

1187
01:18:09,526 --> 01:18:12,632
Go and change this. Take a bath
properly and meet her..

1188
01:18:12,863 --> 01:18:14,968
...without smell. And take a rose.

1189
01:18:15,699 --> 01:18:16,803
Show me your hand.

1190
01:18:32,649 --> 01:18:33,992
Hey, hi! What's up!

1191
01:18:34,051 --> 01:18:36,327
Hi, guys. Thanks.

1192
01:18:37,654 --> 01:18:39,634
Thank you so much. -Here.

1193
01:18:40,090 --> 01:18:41,694
Hi, thanks. -Hello, Miss Shalini.

1194
01:18:41,959 --> 01:18:43,700
Rose. -Happy birthday. -Wow.

1195
01:18:43,761 --> 01:18:48,506
Enough of this suppressed life.

1196
01:18:49,333 --> 01:18:53,008
Enough of this resentment.

1197
01:18:54,605 --> 01:18:59,577
What should I say to you?

1198
01:18:59,977 --> 01:19:04,517
So that you get appeased.

1199
01:19:05,816 --> 01:19:10,959
I accept that I'm wrong.

1200
01:19:11,622 --> 01:19:15,536
And you're right.

1201
01:19:17,094 --> 01:19:24,569
Let's meet first.

1202
01:19:28,105 --> 01:19:35,990
Let's meet first.

1203
01:19:46,890 --> 01:19:49,871
I am restless.

1204
01:19:50,828 --> 01:19:53,570
You are restless.

1205
01:19:54,698 --> 01:19:59,807
There is restlessness
all around.

1206
01:20:00,537 --> 01:20:03,313
My beloved!

1207
01:20:04,374 --> 01:20:06,911
My beloved!

1208
01:20:26,697 --> 01:20:30,076
This is your effect..

1209
01:20:30,467 --> 01:20:33,778
...that when I see mirror..

1210
01:20:34,304 --> 01:20:42,416
...I see you instead of myself.

1211
01:20:42,679 --> 01:20:45,558
In my life..

1212
01:20:46,517 --> 01:20:53,332
In my life,
there is only your charm.

1213
01:20:54,691 --> 01:20:56,864
Beloved!

1214
01:20:58,028 --> 01:21:01,100
0' beloved!

1215
01:21:01,899 --> 01:21:05,472
I am restless.

1216
01:21:05,702 --> 01:21:09,013
You are restless.

1217
01:21:09,606 --> 01:21:14,487
There is restlessness
all around.

1218
01:21:15,546 --> 01:21:18,755
My beloved!

1219
01:21:19,116 --> 01:21:22,791
My beloved!

1220
01:21:27,891 --> 01:21:29,962
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1221
01:21:30,327 --> 01:21:31,704
Hey, capped one! Give me.

1222
01:21:32,429 --> 01:21:34,067
Fool. Miser.

1223
01:21:37,034 --> 01:21:38,741
Hey, give me.

1224
01:21:43,740 --> 01:21:45,515
Give me. I danced for you.

1225
01:21:46,410 --> 01:21:47,821
Give me.

1226
01:21:49,780 --> 01:21:51,316
I too danced. Give me.

1227
01:21:51,782 --> 01:21:53,853
You're mad.

1228
01:21:54,551 --> 01:21:55,894
Strange times!

1229
01:22:06,930 --> 01:22:09,467
Yes. There is a letter for you.

1230
01:22:10,534 --> 01:22:11,569
Take it.

1231
01:22:15,405 --> 01:22:17,908
I'm going, sir. -Why?

1232
01:22:19,743 --> 01:22:21,381
Is your mother fine?

1233
01:22:22,379 --> 01:22:23,653
I lied to you for this room.

1234
01:22:25,616 --> 01:22:27,095
She passed away when I was ten,
slr.

1235
01:22:29,886 --> 01:22:33,265
I was expelled from my hostel even
though it wasn't my fault.

1236
01:22:36,893 --> 01:22:39,339
If I'd returned home, dad would've
thought that I've given up.

1237
01:22:41,732 --> 01:22:43,405
And sir,
in army second means failed.

1238
01:22:46,470 --> 01:22:50,077
I forgot what I came to achieve
and I ventured..

1239
01:22:50,841 --> 01:22:52,377
...to achieve the impossible.

1240
01:22:53,343 --> 01:22:55,084
Mother isn't such a cheap thing..

1241
01:22:56,046 --> 01:22:57,719
Don't make wrong use of her.

1242
01:23:00,417 --> 01:23:01,862
The city corrupts you, sir.

1243
01:23:35,585 --> 01:23:38,065
Nice way to hide your impotency.

1244
01:23:39,723 --> 01:23:41,896
City corrupts you.

1245
01:23:43,493 --> 01:23:46,064
When you fail, you blame the city.

1246
01:23:46,930 --> 01:23:50,275
Have pity on yourself
and leave the arena.

1247
01:23:51,702 --> 01:23:53,648
Because city corrupts you.

1248
01:23:55,072 --> 01:23:57,609
Thank God you're not
a soldier or else..

1249
01:23:57,674 --> 01:23:59,984
...what would've happened
to the country.

1250
01:24:00,043 --> 01:24:01,078
Idiot!

1251
01:24:15,759 --> 01:24:18,330
Take this. Your favorite
corn flake. -Thank you.

1252
01:24:18,829 --> 01:24:21,742
Eat it quickly. Manik, get back.

1253
01:24:21,798 --> 01:24:24,506
0k. -What's this your mumbo-jumbo.

1254
01:24:25,102 --> 01:24:27,708
Hey, you dance all day
but never the a show.

1255
01:24:28,605 --> 01:24:30,107
Hey,
who will keep that chair down.

1256
01:24:30,640 --> 01:24:31,880
Hey, Bunty. How are you?

1257
01:24:32,242 --> 01:24:36,054
Where is your Subbu? He gave
expensive coffee maker and..

1258
01:24:37,347 --> 01:24:38,917
If he isn't here,
why do you get sad?

1259
01:24:39,516 --> 01:24:41,826
Manik, give him milk. -What's up?

1260
01:24:41,985 --> 01:24:44,056
Yes. -Are you ok?

1261
01:24:47,724 --> 01:24:49,397
Come on. -Hi, Pumpkin. What's up?

1262
01:24:49,459 --> 01:24:51,063
'Hi. -Look, Shalini is here.

1263
01:24:51,428 --> 01:24:53,601
Shall.. -Miss Dilshad Nanji.

1264
01:24:54,965 --> 01:24:56,000
Papa.

1265
01:25:02,639 --> 01:25:04,312
Miss Dilshad Nanji.

1266
01:25:05,375 --> 01:25:07,912
Rahul Sood.
Legal attorney. Blue Bell.

1267
01:25:13,617 --> 01:25:15,028
Pleasure meeting you, Miss Nanji.

1268
01:25:16,319 --> 01:25:18,560
Miss Nanji,
this place belongs to Zubin lrani.

1269
01:25:18,989 --> 01:25:22,368
And you've squatted on it
illegally for the past 30 years.

1270
01:25:22,926 --> 01:25:28,069
So now you've 30 days to evict
or we'll take legal action.

1271
01:25:29,533 --> 01:25:32,605
Right? Yes. Thank you.

1272
01:25:32,969 --> 01:25:35,279
Acknowledge this notice. Please.

1273
01:25:36,373 --> 01:25:37,818
Good. Sign it.

1274
01:25:40,577 --> 01:25:43,490
Sign it, Miss Nanji.
Please. Right here.

1275
01:25:54,391 --> 01:25:55,426
Thank you.

1276
01:26:08,672 --> 01:26:09,707
WQW!

1277
01:26:10,841 --> 01:26:13,082
Hello. -Quite a change.

1278
01:26:15,312 --> 01:26:16,518
Good. Nice.

1279
01:26:16,580 --> 01:26:17,615
Papa.

1280
01:26:17,948 --> 01:26:20,019
Don't go. -Hey, champ!

1281
01:26:22,018 --> 01:26:23,622
Papa will be back. Ok?

1282
01:26:46,509 --> 01:26:47,920
What?

1283
01:26:50,881 --> 01:26:52,758
You signed the document
without reading it.

1284
01:26:54,718 --> 01:26:58,393
We can hire a nice lawyer and
give them befitting reply.

1285
01:27:01,625 --> 01:27:03,627
If you've legal document,
give it to me.

1286
01:27:06,997 --> 01:27:08,476
I don't have it.

1287
01:27:10,500 --> 01:27:12,036
Ownership deed.

1288
01:27:13,904 --> 01:27:14,939
Yes? -No.

1289
01:27:17,707 --> 01:27:19,084
Rent receipt.

1290
01:27:23,947 --> 01:27:27,554
Your name isn't Dilshad lrani,
but Dilshad Nanji.

1291
01:27:27,851 --> 01:27:29,626
For so many years you've
been running..

1292
01:27:29,686 --> 01:27:31,324
...this Cafe without any documents.

1293
01:27:31,388 --> 01:27:33,595
How is it possible?
- It's possible.

1294
01:27:37,460 --> 01:27:38,962
Zubin had given this place to me.

1295
01:27:40,697 --> 01:27:42,108
Everything isn't given in writing.

1296
01:27:45,735 --> 01:27:48,477
This weakens our case.

1297
01:27:50,340 --> 01:27:51,944
Madam. Madam.

1298
01:27:54,010 --> 01:27:56,081
Relax. Relax. Manik

1299
01:28:03,019 --> 01:28:10,494
The bond of love is the greatest?

1300
01:28:11,494 --> 01:28:18,935
It gives the strength to
fight the world alone.

1301
01:28:23,006 --> 01:28:25,919
What a doctor!
It's vesicle attack. Go and read.

1302
01:28:25,976 --> 01:28:27,751
Tell me in the evening. Idiot.

1303
01:28:28,611 --> 01:28:31,148
Look.. -They've five lines for
degrees ahead of their names.

1304
01:28:32,816 --> 01:28:34,625
I treated my mother for
15 fifteen years.

1305
01:28:34,684 --> 01:28:36,425
I know which medicine
to give and when.

1306
01:28:37,053 --> 01:28:39,659
They know nothing.
- They know only two things.

1307
01:28:39,723 --> 01:28:41,361
One is injection.
Other is operation.

1308
01:28:41,691 --> 01:28:43,068
Idiot. -Why, Subbu?

1309
01:28:43,727 --> 01:28:46,936
Why do you fight with everyone?
- I never fought with anyone.

1310
01:28:49,099 --> 01:28:51,670
Don't lie. Should I've let him
give you wrong injection?

1311
01:28:52,635 --> 01:28:55,115
Sign on this.
Application for stay order.

1312
01:28:55,939 --> 01:28:59,477
This..
no.. -Be careful. Just a minute.

1313
01:28:59,542 --> 01:29:03,354
Ah.. you said that we
can't save the Cafe.

1314
01:29:04,014 --> 01:29:05,459
Yes. -I too feel the same.

1315
01:29:05,515 --> 01:29:07,654
But it's not necessary for me
to be right all the time.

1316
01:29:07,917 --> 01:29:09,487
I was wrong. Sign here.

1317
01:29:14,691 --> 01:29:15,726
Thank you.

1318
01:29:17,327 --> 01:29:18,362
Come.

1319
01:29:25,735 --> 01:29:27,112
What's going on, Amit? Sit down.

1320
01:29:27,337 --> 01:29:28,680
I mean what is this happening.

1321
01:29:28,738 --> 01:29:30,513
Who is this idiot Subramaniyam
who got the stay order?

1322
01:29:30,573 --> 01:29:33,952
Mr. Mehta, don't worry about
Subramaniyam. I know him well.

1323
01:29:34,444 --> 01:29:35,718
He used to work in my office.

1324
01:29:35,779 --> 01:29:37,656
And he's just a typist.
That's all.

1325
01:29:38,081 --> 01:29:39,958
He has never been to
court for years.

1326
01:29:40,283 --> 01:29:41,990
He can't fight this case.
Don't worry about it.

1327
01:29:42,052 --> 01:29:44,032
Listen.. -We won't let them
hire another lawyer.

1328
01:29:44,087 --> 01:29:45,691
Amit,
this case shouldn't get dragged.

1329
01:29:45,755 --> 01:29:47,063
This is your responsibility.

1330
01:29:47,323 --> 01:29:49,667
Mr. Sood, come with me. I want
to talk to you, please. -Sure.

1331
01:29:49,926 --> 01:29:51,599
Excuse me.

1332
01:29:53,096 --> 01:29:54,837
What will happen? What?

1333
01:29:55,098 --> 01:29:58,102
All are upset that if Cafe shuts
down where will we party.

1334
01:29:58,768 --> 01:30:00,577
Stop being a drama queen Priyanka.
Come on.

1335
01:30:01,404 --> 01:30:02,439
It's strange.

1336
01:30:02,739 --> 01:30:05,481
We're so selfish that we're just
thinking about ourselves.

1337
01:30:05,809 --> 01:30:07,686
Nobody is thinking about
aunt Dilshad. Right?

1338
01:30:08,311 --> 01:30:10,621
This Cafe is her life.
Just think about it.

1339
01:30:11,614 --> 01:30:13,116
And we're here, just..

1340
01:30:16,820 --> 01:30:19,892
Kid, you'_re doipg that heritage
project. Rlght? -Yes.

1341
01:30:20,523 --> 01:30:22,332
What's the construction
date of this place?

1342
01:30:23,093 --> 01:30:25,869
1923. -1923.

1343
01:30:26,129 --> 01:30:27,733
Come on. We've to go. Get up fast.

1344
01:30:27,931 --> 01:30:29,672
Bye. Come on fast. Let's go.

1345
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:32,479
Zubin's heir.

1346
01:30:33,036 --> 01:30:34,071
Yes.

1347
01:30:34,938 --> 01:30:36,508
Jamshed lrani.

1348
01:30:37,574 --> 01:30:38,609
No.

1349
01:30:40,009 --> 01:30:42,819
If it had been true,
Zubin would've told me.

1350
01:30:44,547 --> 01:30:46,993
Look,
if you want to save this Cafe..

1351
01:30:47,984 --> 01:30:49,759
...answer my question.

1352
01:30:53,022 --> 01:30:56,560
Did Zubin mention this
property anywhere.

1353
01:30:58,394 --> 01:31:00,431
Yes? -Hmm!

1354
01:31:03,733 --> 01:31:05,337
Did he mention it?

1355
01:31:06,336 --> 01:31:08,646
Ah.. no.

1356
01:31:13,076 --> 01:31:15,613
You're hiding something? Ah?

1357
01:31:18,681 --> 01:31:20,786
Yes. Hello. Son.

1358
01:31:21,050 --> 01:31:22,586
Mother, are you all right?

1359
01:31:22,652 --> 01:31:25,462
Mother is fine, child. -Mother..

1360
01:31:25,522 --> 01:31:29,698
...If Aryan hadn't called I
wouldn't have known you're so ill.

1361
01:31:30,126 --> 01:31:31,662
I'm fine, child.

1362
01:31:31,961 --> 01:31:34,874
Child, I just got giddy and..

1363
01:31:34,931 --> 01:31:36,672
...hospital.. -Mother, please.

1364
01:31:37,033 --> 01:31:40,480
Nobody stays in hospital for
three days for giddiness.

1365
01:31:41,337 --> 01:31:43,544
And who is this Subbu?

1366
01:31:44,641 --> 01:31:46,086
He's a friend. And a lawyer.

1367
01:31:46,743 --> 01:31:49,485
Lawyer?
What is a lawyer doing there?

1368
01:31:50,613 --> 01:31:52,456
That's it, mom. I'm coming.

1369
01:31:52,849 --> 01:31:55,329
Dilnaz, listen. Hello.

1370
01:31:57,053 --> 01:31:59,090
She's stubborn.

1371
01:31:59,889 --> 01:32:03,098
She's your daughter. She should
be here with you. You know.

1372
01:32:05,528 --> 01:32:08,407
30 years ago, I was in Mumbai
when father was ill.

1373
01:32:10,567 --> 01:32:11,978
I couldn't go.

1374
01:32:13,403 --> 01:32:14,905
If I'd been there..

1375
01:32:15,538 --> 01:32:17,415
She should be here with you.

1376
01:32:19,609 --> 01:32:20,713
Manik.

1377
01:32:21,878 --> 01:32:23,619
Pick up the phone.

1378
01:32:26,549 --> 01:32:27,994
That's a very good idea, Shalini.

1379
01:32:28,718 --> 01:32:30,755
We need public support
to turn Lucky..

1380
01:32:30,820 --> 01:32:32,595
...Cafe into a heritage building.

1381
01:32:32,855 --> 01:32:34,664
And I don't mean just
10-15 people.

1382
01:32:34,724 --> 01:32:36,965
We've to gather the entire city.
- We'll gather them.

1383
01:32:37,627 --> 01:32:40,369
We'll get on the street. Signature
campaign is the way, guys.

1384
01:32:40,630 --> 01:32:42,701
Right, kid?
And we can talk to Raghav too.

1385
01:32:42,765 --> 01:32:44,267
He's got great fan following.

1386
01:32:44,534 --> 01:32:47,344
Oh my God!
That's such an amazing idea.

1387
01:32:47,403 --> 01:32:48,780
When can we go to meet him?

1388
01:32:48,838 --> 01:32:50,408
No you, mellow queen. Kid.

1389
01:32:51,374 --> 01:32:54,321
Tomorrow after my shoot.
I'll send the address.

1390
01:32:54,744 --> 01:32:57,486
But why not me? -Whatever.

1391
01:33:00,617 --> 01:33:03,097
You see, I've to keep the record.

1392
01:33:03,519 --> 01:33:06,796
Who was born?
Who died? Who married whom?

1393
01:33:07,390 --> 01:33:11,099
Young man, there was a time when
we ruled the entire Bombay.

1394
01:33:12,295 --> 01:33:14,639
Now big names are disappearing
one by one.

1395
01:33:14,998 --> 01:33:16,739
I too don't keep well these days.

1396
01:33:17,100 --> 01:33:20,013
Drink tea.
Keep the book and drink tea.

1397
01:33:20,803 --> 01:33:23,443
Thank you. This Zubin lrani..

1398
01:33:25,642 --> 01:33:27,747
Zubin. Zubin Dhanedah..

1399
01:33:28,044 --> 01:33:30,957
He lived in Tardeo in front
of Parsi temple.

1400
01:33:31,414 --> 01:33:33,360
He'd a great bungalow.

1401
01:33:33,583 --> 01:33:35,824
He'd big phones.

1402
01:33:36,552 --> 01:33:37,997
Did Zubin marry?

1403
01:33:39,555 --> 01:33:40,932
I don't have his record.

1404
01:33:41,324 --> 01:33:42,894
But nobody asks these days.

1405
01:33:42,959 --> 01:33:45,405
Marriages were grand
during our times.

1406
01:33:45,461 --> 01:33:47,668
With music. And guests.

1407
01:33:47,730 --> 01:33:49,368
There used to be celebration.

1408
01:33:53,336 --> 01:33:54,838
Zubin's brother Dinshaw..

1409
01:33:56,539 --> 01:34:00,282
Dinshaw lrani? -Yes.
- He was a rogue. Scum!

1410
01:34:00,343 --> 01:34:03,051
He fled with his house maid Ganga.

1411
01:34:07,784 --> 01:34:10,390
By the way, what's this all about?

1412
01:34:11,954 --> 01:34:14,730
One more man came to
inquire about Zubin.

1413
01:34:16,459 --> 01:34:18,769
What was his name? -Aslam.

1414
01:34:24,467 --> 01:34:27,414
Green shirt on green background.
Only head will be visible.

1415
01:34:27,704 --> 01:34:29,115
Stop the bloody machine.

1416
01:34:29,505 --> 01:34:30,984
Shalini. Right? -Sir.

1417
01:34:31,607 --> 01:34:33,280
I gave you direction department.

1418
01:34:33,509 --> 01:34:35,250
...so that you ruin my
work all the time?

1419
01:34:35,345 --> 01:34:36,722
No, sir. -Cheque. Cheque.

1420
01:34:36,913 --> 01:34:38,586
If you're so concerned
about cheque..

1421
01:34:38,848 --> 01:34:41,488
...then go home.
I'll send your cheque.

1422
01:34:41,818 --> 01:34:44,594
But sir, on Croma..
- Don't ruin my shoot.

1423
01:34:44,821 --> 01:34:46,323
You've spoilt my shooting.

1424
01:34:46,522 --> 01:34:48,399
I've tolerated you so far
because of Raghav.

1425
01:34:48,658 --> 01:34:50,069
You know nothing. Pack up.

1426
01:34:50,793 --> 01:34:52,795
Sir, I'm sorry.
- Pack up for you also.

1427
01:34:53,896 --> 01:34:54,931
Darn it!

1428
01:35:07,610 --> 01:35:09,055
Turn left from ahead.

1429
01:35:33,936 --> 01:35:35,643
What rubbish! -What happened?

1430
01:35:35,705 --> 01:35:37,412
Shalini baby, I love you so much.

1431
01:35:37,707 --> 01:35:38,981
I can do anything for you..

1432
01:35:39,041 --> 01:35:41,043
...but don't tell me to
go against Blue Bells.

1433
01:35:41,310 --> 01:35:42,880
It's absolutely insane.

1434
01:35:42,945 --> 01:35:45,653
What? -It's madness.
- Aunt Dilshad helped you a lot.

1435
01:35:45,715 --> 01:35:47,661
And don't forget that.
- So what should I do?

1436
01:35:47,950 --> 01:35:49,588
What do you want me to do, madam?

1437
01:35:52,488 --> 01:35:54,024
I should ruin my career for her?

1438
01:35:54,557 --> 01:35:55,695
For her Cafe?

1439
01:35:56,626 --> 01:35:57,866
I got show of Beyonce.

1440
01:35:59,061 --> 01:36:00,369
Because of Blue Bells.

1441
01:36:00,763 --> 01:36:01,798
I should leave it.

1442
01:36:01,964 --> 01:36:05,502
Hi, Raghav.
How are you my, baby? -Hey.

1443
01:36:05,868 --> 01:36:08,405
I'm good.
- You're looking great. -Thanks.

1444
01:36:08,971 --> 01:36:11,451
Ah.. this is Shalini.

1445
01:36:11,774 --> 01:36:14,380
Hi, Shalini. -Shalini, she's
Jenny. She's a good friend.

1446
01:36:17,013 --> 01:36:18,515
I was telling you about Jenny.

1447
01:36:18,581 --> 01:36:20,322
She's doing Blue Bells
Beyonce show.

1448
01:36:20,583 --> 01:36:23,029
She's a sweetheart.
- Come on. Stop it.

1449
01:36:23,486 --> 01:36:25,488
You've to listen to the new song.
It's brilliant.

1450
01:36:25,922 --> 01:36:28,596
Absolutely.
- So then record it, sweetie.

1451
01:36:28,658 --> 01:36:30,934
Yeah. Yeah.
- We should record it, I guess.

1452
01:36:32,361 --> 01:36:33,499
I guess you're..

1453
01:36:34,697 --> 01:36:36,574
Very busy. -Shalini.

1454
01:36:37,767 --> 01:36:39,246
Bye. Nice meeting you.

1455
01:36:39,969 --> 01:36:41,915
Great timing. -Let's go, kid.

1456
01:36:42,405 --> 01:36:43,440
Thank God you came.

1457
01:36:43,673 --> 01:36:46,051
Was there a problem?
- I was in an awkward position.

1458
01:36:46,876 --> 01:36:50,380
Ah.. -Settle down with her. You'll
know the right position.

1459
01:36:50,580 --> 01:36:51,923
And for her.. -Shut up!

1460
01:36:53,382 --> 01:36:54,554
Don't you do that again.

1461
01:36:55,885 --> 01:36:56,955
Is she upset?

1462
01:37:03,426 --> 01:37:04,700
Miss Shalini. -Yes.

1463
01:37:06,562 --> 01:37:09,600
Even if you hadn't abused,
he would've understand.

1464
01:37:13,803 --> 01:37:16,409
Singing song isn't the only
way to gather people.

1465
01:37:17,273 --> 01:37:19,310
Those who love Cafe will
come by themselves.

1466
01:37:21,410 --> 01:37:25,654
Let's join hands.

1467
01:37:25,715 --> 01:37:27,558
Let's join hands.

1468
01:37:28,184 --> 01:37:30,130
Kid, got the date of
heritage committee.

1469
01:37:30,719 --> 01:37:34,758
Let's join hands.

1470
01:37:34,824 --> 01:37:39,295
Let's join hands.
- I'm not leaving the army, sir.

1471
01:37:39,361 --> 01:37:41,363
Just once I want to see those
people from close..

1472
01:37:41,597 --> 01:37:42,905
...for whom we give our lives.

1473
01:37:43,399 --> 01:37:45,345
Not a couple..

1474
01:37:45,734 --> 01:37:47,680
Not a dozen..

1475
01:37:47,870 --> 01:37:51,818
But now the entire crowd
will rally around.

1476
01:37:52,174 --> 01:37:54,051
Now forget profit, dear.

1477
01:37:54,310 --> 01:37:56,221
Forget your greed.

1478
01:37:56,645 --> 01:37:59,990
Love will resonate.

1479
01:38:00,916 --> 01:38:02,623
Your love is profit.

1480
01:38:03,085 --> 01:38:04,359
Your love is the result.

1481
01:38:05,221 --> 01:38:07,326
Your love is profit.
Your love is the result.

1482
01:38:07,389 --> 01:38:09,426
Let's join hands.

1483
01:38:11,827 --> 01:38:15,331
Let's join hands.

1484
01:38:16,098 --> 01:38:19,375
Let's join hands.

1485
01:38:28,744 --> 01:38:33,625
Where it's crime to live
life on our own terms..

1486
01:38:35,084 --> 01:38:40,227
...greed control the humans.

1487
01:38:41,724 --> 01:38:45,968
What can one do if honesty
doesn't work?

1488
01:38:46,028 --> 01:38:50,738
Now how can long can one sit
quiet in name of decency?

1489
01:38:52,635 --> 01:38:56,208
Let's march and conquer.

1490
01:38:56,939 --> 01:39:01,251
Let's march and conquer.
Let's join hands.

1491
01:39:03,312 --> 01:39:07,021
Let's join hands.

1492
01:39:07,850 --> 01:39:11,195
Let's join hands.

1493
01:39:12,121 --> 01:39:14,192
Not a couple..

1494
01:39:14,256 --> 01:39:16,099
Not a dozen..

1495
01:39:16,358 --> 01:39:20,101
But now the entire crowd
will rally around.

1496
01:39:20,863 --> 01:39:23,275
These students are from
Kingston college.

1497
01:39:23,332 --> 01:39:25,903
They're trying to save
our heritage.

1498
01:39:26,101 --> 01:39:30,049
They're doing something which our
government should've done.

1499
01:39:30,239 --> 01:39:32,310
But now these students have
taken the responsibility.

1500
01:39:32,775 --> 01:39:35,756
It's sad that multinational
companies are snatching..

1501
01:39:35,811 --> 01:39:37,984
...our heritage with
their money powers.

1502
01:39:39,014 --> 01:39:40,220
Can you excuse us please?

1503
01:39:45,888 --> 01:39:47,731
They can't protect these
heritage sites.

1504
01:39:49,224 --> 01:39:51,033
Gateway of India has
become picnic spot.

1505
01:39:51,293 --> 01:39:53,204
Taj Mahal is sinking 2
millimeters every year.

1506
01:39:53,996 --> 01:39:55,304
But they're after Lucky Cafe.

1507
01:39:55,965 --> 01:39:58,275
Amit, do something of that
heritage committee.

1508
01:39:59,001 --> 01:40:01,743
If this Cafe becomes heritage
site, we can't do anything.

1509
01:40:01,804 --> 01:40:03,283
Relax, sir.

1510
01:40:04,340 --> 01:40:05,614
Nothing will happen.

1511
01:40:06,008 --> 01:40:07,646
Heritage committee won't
do anything.

1512
01:40:08,844 --> 01:40:10,380
They've been given so
much money that..

1513
01:40:10,946 --> 01:40:13,119
They'll not just change the rule,
but the entire rule book.

1514
01:40:13,816 --> 01:40:15,124
Trust me. -Great.

1515
01:40:16,118 --> 01:40:17,654
Yes, Amit. For God's sake"

1516
01:40:19,221 --> 01:40:20,359
...talk to your wife.

1517
01:40:21,623 --> 01:40:22,863
What's this with rallies?

1518
01:40:23,225 --> 01:40:25,796
Unnecessarily she's trying to
be 'Joan of Arc'. -Mr. Mehta.

1519
01:40:29,264 --> 01:40:30,299
I'm sorry.

1520
01:40:31,300 --> 01:40:34,144
But it's better if you keep
my wife out of it.

1521
01:40:34,803 --> 01:40:35,941
Amit.

1522
01:40:36,872 --> 01:40:38,078
Amit, listen to me.

1523
01:40:38,841 --> 01:40:40,184
Either you're up or you're out.

1524
01:40:40,709 --> 01:40:42,746
And in this case,
you'll be totally left out.

1525
01:40:44,246 --> 01:40:46,317
Don't forget that you've done
everything in this case.

1526
01:40:46,382 --> 01:40:47,952
Payments, bribe and everything.

1527
01:40:48,817 --> 01:40:50,023
Case will be against you.

1528
01:40:50,285 --> 01:40:52,094
Forget that. Think of your flat.

1529
01:40:52,154 --> 01:40:54,191
Four bedroom flats.
You've to pay installments.

1530
01:40:55,657 --> 01:40:57,830
Listen.
Use your brains, not heart.

1531
01:40:58,327 --> 01:41:00,398
For God's sake, stop being a
hero like in Hindi films.

1532
01:41:00,929 --> 01:41:02,875
And I know you can do it.
You're my man. Come on.

1533
01:41:10,339 --> 01:41:13,218
Kid, you took so many photographs
of heritage sites..

1534
01:41:13,275 --> 01:41:15,050
...so why didn't you present
them to the committee?'

1535
01:41:15,110 --> 01:41:17,021
It wasn't so nice to..

1536
01:41:17,746 --> 01:41:20,158
Strange!
You took 10 snaps of each place..

1537
01:41:20,215 --> 01:41:21,660
...but none are nice.

1538
01:41:23,152 --> 01:41:26,190
L.. I.. I guess I'm a bad
photographer, madam.

1539
01:41:30,959 --> 01:41:33,166
Really? I should've clicked them.

1540
01:41:39,034 --> 01:41:40,240
Let's go.

1541
01:41:41,036 --> 01:41:42,071
Go.

1542
01:41:43,305 --> 01:41:44,375
Pull over, kid.

1543
01:41:45,374 --> 01:41:48,753
But Shalini, you live there.
- No, I stay here.

1544
01:41:50,212 --> 01:41:51,247
Really?

1545
01:41:53,849 --> 01:41:55,920
Not so cool. -No.

1546
01:41:57,686 --> 01:41:58,892
It's super cool.

1547
01:42:00,622 --> 01:42:03,660
Miss Shalini,
where you live, what you do..

1548
01:42:04,293 --> 01:42:06,796
...It could make difference
to others.

1549
01:42:07,663 --> 01:42:09,006
But it shouldn't matter to you.

1550
01:42:10,099 --> 01:42:12,409
If you respect yourself,
everyone else will do it too.

1551
01:42:14,002 --> 01:42:15,709
I like you the way you're.

1552
01:42:17,139 --> 01:42:18,209
Excuse me.

1553
01:42:19,741 --> 01:42:21,652
L.. I'm..

1554
01:42:22,010 --> 01:42:23,148
I've to get up early.

1555
01:42:36,992 --> 01:42:38,562
Hey! Listen.

1556
01:42:38,861 --> 01:42:42,172
Do it quickly. We don't have time.
- Bring water from downstairs.

1557
01:42:42,231 --> 01:42:44,768
How long will you pour water from
buckets? -What are you doing?

1558
01:42:45,300 --> 01:42:46,370
What's going on?

1559
01:42:46,735 --> 01:42:48,339
We're loading. We know nothing.

1560
01:42:48,670 --> 01:42:50,115
Ask brother Aslam. He's upstairs.

1561
01:42:50,205 --> 01:42:51,343
Manik, get the bucket.

1562
01:42:51,707 --> 01:42:53,880
I'll get it.
- Stop this about bucket.

1563
01:42:54,109 --> 01:42:55,713
Dilshad, do something.

1564
01:42:55,911 --> 01:42:58,323
He bought the flat upstairs, so
will he break the Cafe? -Not now.

1565
01:42:58,380 --> 01:43:00,587
I've headache. -I'll call Subbu.

1566
01:43:00,649 --> 01:43:01,684
I'll phone him.

1567
01:43:01,884 --> 01:43:04,091
You can do what you want.
I'm going.

1568
01:43:10,325 --> 01:43:11,360
Granny.

1569
01:43:12,127 --> 01:43:13,936
Why do you want to
go to Australia?

1570
01:43:18,066 --> 01:43:21,639
Won't you fight if someone
steals me from you?

1571
01:43:24,706 --> 01:43:25,980
Granny, wait.

1572
01:43:28,277 --> 01:43:29,415
Man to man.

1573
01:43:29,811 --> 01:43:31,620
Do you love me as much
as you love the Cafe.

1574
01:43:34,750 --> 01:43:35,990
Much more.

1575
01:43:36,685 --> 01:43:38,631
Much more. -I love you, granny.

1576
01:43:51,700 --> 01:43:53,702
Too coffee. One espresso and..

1577
01:43:54,002 --> 01:43:56,312
One Latte for our civil engineer,
Mr. Desai.

1578
01:43:56,772 --> 01:43:59,116
Oh and send some cookies. -Only
coffee with milk is available.

1579
01:43:59,374 --> 01:44:00,819
But you won't get even that.

1580
01:44:00,909 --> 01:44:03,116
Manik,
give him coffee and cookies.

1581
01:44:03,612 --> 01:44:05,717
It's free for them. -Fine.

1582
01:44:08,050 --> 01:44:09,085
Sir.

1583
01:44:09,618 --> 01:44:11,325
Idea of heritage plea was good.
Nice.

1584
01:44:12,854 --> 01:44:14,697
But your plea has been rejected.

1585
01:44:15,057 --> 01:44:17,298
Maybe the committee erred,
so now..

1586
01:44:18,093 --> 01:44:19,936
...Justice Ketapal has passed
the order that..

1587
01:44:19,995 --> 01:44:21,736
Old building should be inspected"

1588
01:44:21,797 --> 01:44:26,109
...and if the building isn't
fit or life-threatening"

1589
01:44:26,702 --> 01:44:28,841
...it should be evicted.
I know that.

1590
01:44:29,972 --> 01:44:31,144
Absolutely right, sir.

1591
01:44:31,206 --> 01:44:33,345
So Mr. Desai will inspect
this building.

1592
01:44:34,176 --> 01:44:35,587
We won't let it happen.

1593
01:44:35,777 --> 01:44:37,654
You can't do this.
- Of course, we can.

1594
01:44:38,213 --> 01:44:41,319
If you'll stop him from doing
his work, you'll be arrested.

1595
01:44:41,750 --> 01:44:43,661
It'll be contempt of court.
We've the notice.

1596
01:44:44,286 --> 01:44:46,664
Child, bring the notice.

1597
01:44:57,299 --> 01:44:59,870
Inspection notice.
This is just inspection notice.

1598
01:45:00,068 --> 01:45:01,308
Let him do it.

1599
01:45:03,905 --> 01:45:06,784
In our Tamil there is a proverb.

1600
01:45:07,376 --> 01:45:10,789
It says, when a lizard is
in a corner of a wall..

1601
01:45:11,179 --> 01:45:12,954
...It feels that all
the four walls..

1602
01:45:13,015 --> 01:45:14,653
...are standing on its strength.

1603
01:45:15,183 --> 01:45:16,719
But it's not true.

1604
01:45:18,053 --> 01:45:20,966
Nice proverb, sir. But court needs
evidence, not proverbs.

1605
01:45:21,623 --> 01:45:24,797
And you've taught me to secure
oneself from all sides.

1606
01:45:25,961 --> 01:45:27,372
And I've been your best student.

1607
01:45:28,163 --> 01:45:30,268
Four days. Only four days.

1608
01:46:16,378 --> 01:46:17,686
Hey, Kabir..

1609
01:46:18,080 --> 01:46:19,218
What is this, Amit?

1610
01:46:19,715 --> 01:46:22,059
A six year boy is admitted
in hospital for stress.

1611
01:46:22,651 --> 01:46:25,131
At least don't fight in front
of him. -Ok. I know.

1612
01:46:25,721 --> 01:46:28,133
He's ok.
- He's ok. But please take care.

1613
01:46:35,831 --> 01:46:37,071
Oh God!

1614
01:46:39,267 --> 01:46:40,541
Thank God you're ok.

1615
01:46:46,908 --> 01:46:48,046
Papa. -Hey..

1616
01:46:50,078 --> 01:46:51,989
Hey, champ!

1617
01:46:52,681 --> 01:46:54,354
How are you?

1618
01:46:56,051 --> 01:46:59,692
How are you, son?
- Papa, when I recover..

1619
01:47:00,122 --> 01:47:02,261
...I'll play all the sports.
- Ok, dear.

1620
01:47:02,624 --> 01:47:05,002
I won't touch books.

1621
01:47:05,627 --> 01:47:08,574
I won't go to aunt Dilshad's Cafe.

1622
01:47:08,930 --> 01:47:11,342
But please return her Cafe to her.

1623
01:47:11,900 --> 01:47:13,675
Everyone calls you a villain.

1624
01:47:14,002 --> 01:47:16,209
You're not villain? -No, son.

1625
01:47:22,210 --> 01:47:23,245
No.

1626
01:47:24,780 --> 01:47:26,191
You look like a rock star.

1627
01:47:29,751 --> 01:47:30,957
Everything will be fine.

1628
01:47:31,019 --> 01:47:33,226
Oh, madam. It's hard to meet you.

1629
01:47:33,288 --> 01:47:34,824
You know I went to
Cafe and I found..

1630
01:47:34,890 --> 01:47:36,335
...out that you were
in the hospital.

1631
01:47:36,391 --> 01:47:39,668
Anyway, keep these papers.
These are court summons.

1632
01:47:40,028 --> 01:47:42,201
Please. Please. No need to sign.

1633
01:47:42,264 --> 01:47:43,709
This is eviction notice.

1634
01:47:43,899 --> 01:47:46,175
Right. Well I hope everything
is all right. Goodbye.

1635
01:47:48,270 --> 01:47:49,840
What are you.. -All done.

1636
01:47:50,272 --> 01:47:51,842
Is everything fine? -Yes, but..

1637
01:47:52,007 --> 01:47:53,247
Why here? -Why not?

1638
01:47:53,842 --> 01:47:54,877
We've to win.

1639
01:47:54,943 --> 01:47:56,923
Right. Everything is fine.
We'll see them in court.

1640
01:47:58,713 --> 01:48:00,056
I don't..

1641
01:48:00,348 --> 01:48:01,759
Now why are you here?

1642
01:48:02,384 --> 01:48:03,727
You got everything.

1643
01:48:05,120 --> 01:48:06,622
Anita.. -Stop it.

1644
01:48:07,422 --> 01:48:09,026
What do you think you're doing?

1645
01:48:09,090 --> 01:48:10,228
What are you doing?

1646
01:48:10,792 --> 01:48:12,999
You came here..
In hospital. -Anita.

1647
01:48:13,261 --> 01:48:16,208
You came to hospital with court
summons, Amit. -Just look at you.

1648
01:48:16,264 --> 01:48:18,335
I don't even know you anymore.
- Keep quiet, Anita.

1649
01:48:18,800 --> 01:48:19,870
You got the Cafe.

1650
01:48:19,935 --> 01:48:21,676
You got the Cafe. Now go.

1651
01:48:21,736 --> 01:48:23,147
Aunt, ask him to leave.

1652
01:48:23,205 --> 01:48:24,445
Leave, Amit. Now.

1653
01:48:25,207 --> 01:48:26,413
Go, Amit.

1654
01:48:26,641 --> 01:48:28,143
You've mocked us. -Anita.

1655
01:48:28,210 --> 01:48:30,053
I called him as his son
was in the hospital.

1656
01:48:30,111 --> 01:48:31,715
And he brought a lawyer along.

1657
01:48:35,851 --> 01:48:40,163
Can we save our heritage from
multi-national companies?

1658
01:48:40,222 --> 01:48:43,669
We all have been to one or another
Lucky Cafe in our life.

1659
01:48:43,725 --> 01:48:45,636
Question still remains the same.

1660
01:48:45,694 --> 01:48:48,607
Our every happy and sad memories
are linked to it.

1661
01:48:48,663 --> 01:48:52,702
If you want to join.. -Join the
'Save Lucky Cafe' campaign.

1662
01:48:52,767 --> 01:48:53,905
Lucky Cafe campaign.

1663
01:48:53,969 --> 01:48:55,846
Save Lucky Cafe.
- And make a difference. -Kid.

1664
01:48:56,137 --> 01:48:58,344
Kid. Kid, those people of Blue
Bells came to harass us.

1665
01:48:58,907 --> 01:49:00,113
Nobody will do anything.

1666
01:49:00,876 --> 01:49:02,719
Sir Subbu said nobody
will do anything.

1667
01:49:03,378 --> 01:49:07,622
Or else they'll feel we're
bullying to save Cafe. -Ok? -Kid..

1668
01:49:07,682 --> 01:49:10,822
...did you bring the signature
file of heritage committee?

1669
01:49:11,920 --> 01:49:14,730
What? -Hold.. -Relax, I'll get
it from your house. It's ok.

1670
01:49:15,790 --> 01:49:18,737
Return aunt Dilshad's Cafe to her.

1671
01:49:19,194 --> 01:49:20,935
Everyone calls you villain.

1672
01:49:21,296 --> 01:49:22,673
You're not villain?

1673
01:49:24,165 --> 01:49:30,912
Keep your hands on
eyes stealthily.

1674
01:49:33,942 --> 01:49:40,359
Then say softly,
do you recognize me.

1675
01:49:41,750 --> 01:49:48,133
The one whom I saw with
closed eyes, it's you.

1676
01:49:48,757 --> 01:49:54,105
Let's meet first.

1677
01:49:56,331 --> 01:50:02,304
Let's meet first.

1678
01:50:52,153 --> 01:50:53,325
Mr. Subramaniyam.

1679
01:50:53,722 --> 01:50:55,065
Yes. Come. Come.

1680
01:51:00,228 --> 01:51:01,332
Have a seat.

1681
01:51:12,407 --> 01:51:14,080
Mother, how are you?

1682
01:51:20,649 --> 01:51:21,753
Dilnaz.

1683
01:51:32,861 --> 01:51:33,896
Amita.

1684
01:51:40,802 --> 01:51:41,906
Morning, sir.

1685
01:51:42,904 --> 01:51:44,144
Morning.

1686
01:51:44,305 --> 01:51:45,340
All rise.

1687
01:51:51,713 --> 01:51:53,659
You may start, Mr. Rahul Sood.
- Thank you, madam.

1688
01:51:53,815 --> 01:51:56,091
Your honor, this is a simple case.
- In 1923..

1689
01:51:56,151 --> 01:51:59,860
...Mr. Rustom Jamsed lrani made
a building, Rustom House.

1690
01:52:00,355 --> 01:52:03,165
After his death,
the property was partitioned.

1691
01:52:04,392 --> 01:52:06,804
And this building was given to
his elder son Mr. Zubin lrani.

1692
01:52:08,229 --> 01:52:11,233
Mr. Zubin lrani didn't marry
so he has no children.

1693
01:52:11,299 --> 01:52:13,108
So after his death there
was no claimant..

1694
01:52:13,168 --> 01:52:14,738
...on his property after his death.

1695
01:52:15,003 --> 01:52:17,779
And defendant,
madam Dilshad Nanji..

1696
01:52:18,773 --> 01:52:20,047
...squatted on that property..

1697
01:52:20,842 --> 01:52:22,082
...which is worth millions..

1698
01:52:22,310 --> 01:52:24,119
Without any papers or rights.

1699
01:52:25,080 --> 01:52:26,354
The right thing should be..

1700
01:52:26,948 --> 01:52:29,428
...that after Zubin lrani's
death property should've..

1701
01:52:29,651 --> 01:52:32,029
...been handed to his younger
brother Dinshaw lrani..

1702
01:52:32,854 --> 01:52:34,925
...or to Dinshaw lrani's son,
Jamshed lrani.

1703
01:52:35,290 --> 01:52:38,169
Legally and morally, this property
belongs to Jamshed lrani.

1704
01:52:38,793 --> 01:52:40,864
Your honor,
Dilshad Nanji is a tresspasser.

1705
01:52:41,629 --> 01:52:44,166
Dilshad Nanji has been lying
for the past 30 years.

1706
01:52:44,833 --> 01:52:48,178
She runs many business under the
guise of a Cafe. -Your honor..

1707
01:52:48,236 --> 01:52:50,648
...we're scared to think that
kids of the city go there.

1708
01:52:50,839 --> 01:52:53,012
Action should be taken against
Dilshad Nanji..

1709
01:52:53,074 --> 01:52:54,109
Sir, this is a lie.

1710
01:52:54,809 --> 01:52:56,254
This is too much. -Amit, shut up.

1711
01:52:56,778 --> 01:52:58,951
Excuse me, madam. This is all
fabricated. -Excuse me.

1712
01:52:59,881 --> 01:53:02,054
If you want to say something,
come to the witness box.

1713
01:53:03,618 --> 01:53:05,655
Amit. Amit,
sit down. Where are you going?

1714
01:53:07,355 --> 01:53:08,390
Thank you, madam.

1715
01:53:13,828 --> 01:53:15,000
I'm sorry, madam.

1716
01:53:15,263 --> 01:53:18,005
Sorry for speaking out of turn.
- Madam..

1717
01:53:18,066 --> 01:53:20,842
...my name is Amit Nagpal and I
work for Blue Bell company.

1718
01:53:21,603 --> 01:53:22,775
I'm the CEO, madam.

1719
01:53:23,404 --> 01:53:25,748
To capture Lucky Cafe,
my company..

1720
01:53:26,074 --> 01:53:28,850
"Stole record from lrani Anujam.

1721
01:53:29,644 --> 01:53:32,591
Madam, some people of heritage
committe were bribed too.

1722
01:53:33,748 --> 01:53:36,957
Even a local goon named
Aslam was hired.

1723
01:53:37,652 --> 01:53:40,633
So that he can harass
Miss Dilshad Nanji.

1724
01:53:42,090 --> 01:53:45,037
And for all this, I'm responsible.

1725
01:53:47,362 --> 01:53:49,364
And I'm ready to face..

1726
01:53:51,299 --> 01:53:52,744
...the consequences, madam.

1727
01:53:53,668 --> 01:53:55,011
I don't believe this.

1728
01:53:59,741 --> 01:54:00,913
Mr. Nagpal..

1729
01:54:01,176 --> 01:54:02,985
...on the basis of whatever
you've said..

1730
01:54:03,044 --> 01:54:05,888
...Miss Nanji can take action
against Blue Bells.

1731
01:54:06,714 --> 01:54:08,694
But this doesn't prove
that she's..

1732
01:54:08,750 --> 01:54:10,661
...the owner of dispute property.

1733
01:54:11,219 --> 01:54:12,789
You may continue, Mr. Rahul Sood.

1734
01:54:13,154 --> 01:54:14,997
Thank you, your honor.
- Excuse me, madam.

1735
01:54:15,089 --> 01:54:16,329
Just once chance, madam.

1736
01:54:16,391 --> 01:54:18,132
Madam, just take a look outside.

1737
01:54:18,893 --> 01:54:20,099
You'll understand..

1738
01:54:20,295 --> 01:54:23,003
...what this place means to
the people of this city.

1739
01:54:23,631 --> 01:54:26,373
What does aunt Dilshad
mean to those people?

1740
01:54:27,168 --> 01:54:28,670
I've an humble request, madam.

1741
01:54:29,637 --> 01:54:32,846
Injustice shouldn't be done
with Dilshad Nanji.

1742
01:54:33,074 --> 01:54:34,576
That's why I'm here.

1743
01:54:35,076 --> 01:54:36,282
Madam, please. -That's it.

1744
01:54:36,978 --> 01:54:38,321
You may step down please.

1745
01:54:41,316 --> 01:54:42,351
Yes, madam.

1746
01:54:52,994 --> 01:54:54,371
Finally. Thank God.

1747
01:54:54,796 --> 01:54:57,902
And your honor, this is marriage
certificate of Dinshaw lrani.

1748
01:54:58,266 --> 01:55:00,712
Birth certificate of Jamshed
lrani and lineage deed.

1749
01:55:01,369 --> 01:55:02,871
And, your honor..

1750
01:55:04,038 --> 01:55:05,346
...this is the agreement.

1751
01:55:05,773 --> 01:55:07,650
...In which Jamshed
lrani has sold..

1752
01:55:07,709 --> 01:55:09,347
...his property to Blue Bells Cafe.

1753
01:55:10,144 --> 01:55:13,318
And so I want that for
lying and squatting"

1754
01:55:13,381 --> 01:55:15,884
...on this property for 30 years..

1755
01:55:16,251 --> 01:55:18,231
...defendant Dilshad Nanji
should be punished.

1756
01:55:18,753 --> 01:55:20,391
And Jamshed lrani should
get his right.

1757
01:55:20,722 --> 01:55:21,860
Thank you, your honor.

1758
01:55:21,923 --> 01:55:23,266
Please call Mr. Jamshed lrani.

1759
01:55:28,263 --> 01:55:29,867
Oh my God! It's him.

1760
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:33,206
Jimmy.

1761
01:55:36,905 --> 01:55:39,010
God! Jamshed Dinshaw lrani.

1762
01:55:40,341 --> 01:55:42,821
How could I miss it?
- You're Mr. Jamshed Dinshaw lrani.

1763
01:55:43,912 --> 01:55:44,947
Yes, madam.

1764
01:55:45,580 --> 01:55:47,287
Are these documents provided
by you correct.

1765
01:55:47,749 --> 01:55:49,353
Yeah. I guess so.

1766
01:55:51,886 --> 01:55:53,957
Mr. Subramaniyam,
do you want to ask anything?

1767
01:55:55,857 --> 01:55:57,859
No, your honor.
I don't want Jimmy..

1768
01:55:59,928 --> 01:56:02,636
I don't want to question
Jamshed lrani.

1769
01:56:03,131 --> 01:56:06,237
So do you accept that whatever
Mr. Rahul Sood said is true?

1770
01:56:06,935 --> 01:56:08,278
No, I didn't say that.

1771
01:56:08,870 --> 01:56:11,646
What he said must be
written by some..

1772
01:56:11,706 --> 01:56:14,084
...clerk like me in a small office.

1773
01:56:14,809 --> 01:56:16,152
Am I right, Mr. Sood?

1774
01:56:18,846 --> 01:56:20,883
But truth is in the heart,
not on papers.

1775
01:56:22,350 --> 01:56:24,762
In this court only one person
knows the truth..

1776
01:56:24,819 --> 01:56:27,026
...and I want to call that
person in the court.

1777
01:56:28,189 --> 01:56:30,191
Who is it? -Miss Dilshad Nanji.

1778
01:56:32,327 --> 01:56:34,568
Miss Dilshad Nanji.
- Please. -Take the stand please.

1779
01:56:37,031 --> 01:56:38,066
Miss Nanji.

1780
01:56:38,700 --> 01:56:40,907
Please. Please. Don't be afraid.

1781
01:56:53,948 --> 01:56:56,758
I'm an advocate for last 35 years,
but..

1782
01:56:57,552 --> 01:56:59,623
...this is my first
case in the court.

1783
01:57:00,321 --> 01:57:02,824
If I err, please pardon me.

1784
01:57:03,992 --> 01:57:05,869
Mr. Subramaniyam,
you can start please.

1785
01:57:05,927 --> 01:57:07,031
Thank you, your honor.

1786
01:57:09,797 --> 01:57:11,936
Miss Dilshad Nanji.

1787
01:57:13,101 --> 01:57:16,014
Mr. Sood said that you're not
the owner of this Cafe.

1788
01:57:17,872 --> 01:57:20,352
Then what does this
Cafe mean to you.

1789
01:57:20,575 --> 01:57:22,577
What's your relation with it?

1790
01:57:27,148 --> 01:57:28,786
This Cafe is everything for me.

1791
01:57:30,651 --> 01:57:32,062
It's my life.

1792
01:57:33,988 --> 01:57:35,626
I've looked after
it like my child.

1793
01:57:37,258 --> 01:57:38,828
It was a..

1794
01:57:41,396 --> 01:57:42,704
It's my dream.

1795
01:57:43,631 --> 01:57:48,102
It's a dream for you and you
looked after it for 30 years..

1796
01:57:49,003 --> 01:57:50,380
...now you're handing it to them.

1797
01:57:51,672 --> 01:57:52,912
These are the people, who..

1798
01:57:53,341 --> 01:57:56,288
...are wiping our heritage
in the name of modernity.

1799
01:57:57,178 --> 01:58:00,421
For them aping America and
Europe means progress.

1800
01:58:01,149 --> 01:58:03,060
Even though there are many
villages in Britain..

1801
01:58:04,318 --> 01:58:07,231
...where you can't change anything,
legally.

1802
01:58:08,189 --> 01:58:10,897
Because it's their tradition
and civilization for them.

1803
01:58:11,125 --> 01:58:12,900
It's heritage.
They want to protect it.

1804
01:58:14,929 --> 01:58:18,035
And at our place,
we're snatching rights..

1805
01:58:19,100 --> 01:58:20,340
...and lands for progress.

1806
01:58:21,035 --> 01:58:23,447
Madam, these are the people..

1807
01:58:23,938 --> 01:58:26,282
...who send their father to old
age home when he gets old.

1808
01:58:26,340 --> 01:58:28,217
Instead of Red Fort,
they make mall.

1809
01:58:31,446 --> 01:58:32,857
You too want the same.

1810
01:58:33,815 --> 01:58:34,850
Right?

1811
01:58:35,783 --> 01:58:36,818
No. -No?

1812
01:58:39,187 --> 01:58:40,598
Then stop them.

1813
01:58:43,858 --> 01:58:45,337
Or tell the truth to the court.

1814
01:58:46,027 --> 01:58:47,267
Tell the truth.

1815
01:58:50,264 --> 01:58:53,268
Today many of your students
have gathered here.

1816
01:58:53,334 --> 01:58:55,075
I call them students because..

1817
01:58:56,037 --> 01:58:57,983
...you're their lecturer
outside college.

1818
01:58:59,941 --> 01:59:03,115
They're not here,
because you feed them..

1819
01:59:03,177 --> 01:59:04,656
...snacks and coffee.

1820
01:59:06,013 --> 01:59:08,220
You taught them what life means.

1821
01:59:08,783 --> 01:59:09,955
What courage means?

1822
01:59:10,418 --> 01:59:11,988
He's are you student..

1823
01:59:12,687 --> 01:59:15,668
...Amit Nagpal. I'm happy with him.

1824
01:59:17,024 --> 01:59:20,267
He staked his entire career, job..

1825
01:59:20,995 --> 01:59:23,066
...life and family.

1826
01:59:23,798 --> 01:59:25,869
And he told the truth here.

1827
01:59:26,267 --> 01:59:27,871
I'm proud of him.

1828
01:59:30,671 --> 01:59:31,843
Similarly you too say it.

1829
01:59:33,274 --> 01:59:34,753
Tell the truth to the court.

1830
01:59:36,310 --> 01:59:37,880
You won't get this chance again.

1831
01:59:38,713 --> 01:59:41,159
You won't get this chance.
You'll feel sorry for life.

1832
01:59:46,387 --> 01:59:47,889
I've nothing to say.

1833
01:59:48,856 --> 01:59:50,301
Did in any letter..

1834
01:59:52,760 --> 01:59:54,797
...Zubin mentioned this property?

1835
02:00:02,670 --> 02:00:03,705
No.

1836
02:00:04,105 --> 02:00:07,143
Do you've any document in
which Rustom House or..

1837
02:00:08,342 --> 02:00:10,219
...Lucky Cafe is mentioned?

1838
02:00:13,881 --> 02:00:14,916
No.

1839
02:00:20,688 --> 02:00:24,659
I've some papers I got
from lrani hospital.

1840
02:00:29,197 --> 02:00:32,144
Miss Dilshad lrani. Nanji.

1841
02:00:32,633 --> 02:00:37,013
I've some letters which
I got from you.

1842
02:00:37,071 --> 02:00:38,641
Do you know them?

1843
02:00:40,641 --> 02:00:42,211
Subbu.. -Please. Please.

1844
02:00:42,276 --> 02:00:45,086
I'm not going to say anything
about it. This is your life.

1845
02:00:45,146 --> 02:00:46,989
This is your personal file.
Please hold it.

1846
02:00:47,248 --> 02:00:48,386
Please. Please.

1847
02:00:48,616 --> 02:00:50,152
What is in that file,
Mr. Subramaniyam.

1848
02:00:50,952 --> 02:00:53,899
Your honor, Zubin lrani has
mentioned in this that..

1849
02:00:54,388 --> 02:00:56,061
...who really owns this property.

1850
02:00:56,657 --> 02:00:58,193
I object, your honor.
- This is rubbish.

1851
02:00:58,259 --> 02:00:59,294
This is fraud and..

1852
02:00:59,760 --> 02:01:02,707
Keep.. keep quite for a while.
- Objection over ruled.

1853
02:01:03,130 --> 02:01:04,700
Mr. Subramaniyam, please continue.

1854
02:01:06,734 --> 02:01:08,407
If Zubin lrani had been here..

1855
02:01:08,636 --> 02:01:10,843
...what would he have
told you to do?

1856
02:01:11,105 --> 02:01:12,675
Tell me. What would he have said?

1857
02:01:15,209 --> 02:01:16,654
He would've said..

1858
02:01:18,412 --> 02:01:20,085
...to fight for right
of his daughter.

1859
02:01:20,181 --> 02:01:21,683
Objection, your honor. When..

1860
02:01:21,916 --> 02:01:24,260
...Zubin lrani didn't marry,
how can there be children?

1861
02:01:24,318 --> 02:01:27,697
Wait for a while. -Objection over
ruled. -Your.. -Mr. Sood.

1862
02:01:29,824 --> 02:01:31,098
Yes.

1863
02:01:32,260 --> 02:01:33,295
Who?

1864
02:01:35,796 --> 02:01:37,275
D.. -Who? -Dilnaz.

1865
02:01:38,366 --> 02:01:39,777
Whose daughter is she?

1866
02:01:41,335 --> 02:01:42,837
She's Zubin and my daughter.

1867
02:01:44,772 --> 02:01:46,115
Zubin and my daughter. -My God!

1868
02:01:50,645 --> 02:01:51,817
Sorry, child.

1869
02:01:55,616 --> 02:01:58,688
L.. I didn't want you to
know about it like this.

1870
02:02:02,123 --> 02:02:03,659
I was..

1871
02:02:04,158 --> 02:02:05,398
Child, I was 21..

1872
02:02:06,761 --> 02:02:08,035
...when I was carrying you.

1873
02:02:09,030 --> 02:02:10,270
I didn't get married.

1874
02:02:12,266 --> 02:02:14,212
Zubin went to Brazil
for his project.

1875
02:02:16,304 --> 02:02:17,715
And accident..

1876
02:02:24,245 --> 02:02:25,918
He couldn't even see your face.

1877
02:02:33,754 --> 02:02:34,960
I wanted to tell you.

1878
02:02:35,790 --> 02:02:37,098
I tried a lot.

1879
02:02:39,894 --> 02:02:41,703
But.. I'd no courage.

1880
02:02:42,830 --> 02:02:44,173
I was scared, child.

1881
02:02:45,866 --> 02:02:47,174
I was scared.

1882
02:02:50,771 --> 02:02:52,375
How could you accept..

1883
02:02:54,141 --> 02:02:55,643
What would the people say?

1884
02:02:57,812 --> 02:02:59,348
I'd to lie all my life.

1885
02:03:02,583 --> 02:03:03,789
I'm sorry.

1886
02:03:03,951 --> 02:03:05,191
I'm sorry, child.

1887
02:03:06,921 --> 02:03:09,128
Please. Please forgive me.

1888
02:03:13,060 --> 02:03:14,232
I'm sorry.

1889
02:03:14,295 --> 02:03:16,275
It means you always had this will.

1890
02:03:19,367 --> 02:03:20,675
Yes.

1891
02:03:20,935 --> 02:03:23,814
Then you shouldn't have wasted
court's time like this.

1892
02:03:26,173 --> 02:03:27,413
Time waste..

1893
02:03:29,410 --> 02:03:31,981
Madam, if your child had
been illegitimate..

1894
02:03:32,980 --> 02:03:34,323
...would you've told the world..

1895
02:03:35,182 --> 02:03:36,354
...that it's illegitimate?

1896
02:03:38,919 --> 02:03:40,091
Sorry, madam.

1897
02:03:40,955 --> 02:03:43,333
But even today no matter
how modern we're..

1898
02:03:44,158 --> 02:03:47,367
...but we still call a child born
out of wedlock illegitimate.

1899
02:03:48,162 --> 02:03:50,301
So you didn't know this when..
you know..

1900
02:03:50,831 --> 02:03:52,833
I knew. I knew everything.

1901
02:03:53,300 --> 02:03:54,973
But I didn't know..

1902
02:03:55,269 --> 02:03:58,341
...Zubin will leave me
alone like this.

1903
02:04:01,275 --> 02:04:03,846
Child, you're Zubin lrani..

1904
02:04:04,211 --> 02:04:05,884
...and Dilshad lrani's daughter.

1905
02:04:07,047 --> 02:04:08,253
Dilnaz lrani.

1906
02:04:10,317 --> 02:04:11,887
I'm proud of you, child.

1907
02:04:12,153 --> 02:04:13,291
I'm proud of you.

1908
02:04:23,297 --> 02:04:25,402
Mr. Sood. -Your honor.

1909
02:04:25,633 --> 02:04:28,409
Owner of Rustom House and Lucky
Cafe is in front of you.

1910
02:04:30,337 --> 02:04:31,611
The case is dismissed.

1911
02:04:35,176 --> 02:04:36,655
We won the case.

1912
02:04:39,747 --> 02:04:41,749
Mr. Amit, did you hear?

1913
02:04:42,249 --> 02:04:43,626
We won the case.

1914
02:04:50,991 --> 02:04:52,368
Hey, smile now.

1915
02:04:55,062 --> 02:04:57,167
Kid, you click nice photographs.

1916
02:04:57,665 --> 02:04:58,871
But focus was wrong.

1917
02:04:59,900 --> 02:05:02,813
Brownie points.
You sacrificed army exams..

1918
02:05:03,737 --> 02:05:04,977
...for me.

1919
02:05:05,139 --> 02:05:06,914
For Cafe.
- It's the same thing. Right?

1920
02:05:07,141 --> 02:05:09,621
Now say something.
- Don't move, madam. Please.

1921
02:05:09,677 --> 02:05:10,815
What? -Bunty.

1922
02:05:11,212 --> 02:05:12,247
Yes, sir.

1923
02:05:15,316 --> 02:05:17,853
You came here for this.
- No, sir. Yes, sir.

1924
02:05:23,290 --> 02:05:24,769
I'm proud of you, my son.

1925
02:05:25,726 --> 02:05:27,103
Permission to hug me.

1926
02:05:30,898 --> 02:05:33,970
Mr. Sharma, we want loan. But who
will pay installments. You?

1927
02:05:36,537 --> 02:05:37,845
Oh dear!

1928
02:05:40,107 --> 02:05:41,279
Superman.

1929
02:05:47,748 --> 02:05:49,022
Can you stay in rat hole?

1930
02:05:49,884 --> 02:05:51,227
In one room kitchen.

1931
02:05:52,753 --> 02:05:54,096
You don't have a job.

1932
02:05:56,023 --> 02:05:57,593
You can help me in house chores.

1933
02:05:59,927 --> 02:06:01,372
Yeah? -Yes.

1934
02:06:03,230 --> 02:06:04,265
Love you.

1935
02:06:10,804 --> 02:06:11,839
Subbu.

1936
02:06:13,908 --> 02:06:15,114
Whom are you talking to?

1937
02:06:20,681 --> 02:06:21,887
Now you'll thank me.

1938
02:06:25,853 --> 02:06:26,888
Thank you.

1939
02:06:28,389 --> 02:06:29,868
Now you'll say sorry.

1940
02:06:30,124 --> 02:06:31,865
I've no reason to say sorry.

1941
02:06:32,760 --> 02:06:34,034
I'm never sorry..

1942
02:06:35,996 --> 02:06:37,339
Hey, sorry-

1943
02:06:38,666 --> 02:06:40,907
Now admit in the court of law..

1944
02:06:41,302 --> 02:06:43,908
What?
- You broke the bottle that day.

1945
02:06:44,238 --> 02:06:47,185
No. I didn't the bottle. Actually
I was holding the bottle.

1946
02:06:47,608 --> 02:06:49,281
Look.
I was holding it like this. -No.

1947
02:06:49,677 --> 02:06:52,920
L.. -You held it from other
side from the top. -No.

1948
02:06:52,980 --> 02:06:55,961
Look, you held it like this.
I thought, Oh God..

1949
02:06:56,250 --> 02:06:57,627
So I left it.

1950
02:06:57,685 --> 02:06:59,858
You felt I've held it,
so you dropped it.

1951
02:07:02,156 --> 02:07:04,762
See? You broke the bottle.

1952
02:07:16,170 --> 02:07:18,275
You broke the bottle.

1953
02:07:19,373 --> 02:07:22,081
My Lord, she's the culprit.

1954
02:07:22,142 --> 02:07:24,383
It's not about coffee.

1955
02:07:25,079 --> 02:07:28,026
It's about you and me, honey.

1956
02:07:32,686 --> 02:07:34,996
It's not about coffee.

1957
02:07:36,190 --> 02:07:39,364
It's about you and me, honey.

1958
02:07:40,027 --> 02:07:45,705
Let's meet first.

1959
02:07:47,901 --> 02:07:54,045
Let's meet first.

1960
02:07:55,743 --> 02:07:58,314
Let's meet first.
