1
00:01:34,808 --> 00:01:36,639
I never dreamed big things.

2
00:01:38,145 --> 00:01:43,515
OnIy that both of us
wiII aIways Iive together.

3
00:01:44,618 --> 00:01:47,644
Under one roof.

4
00:01:49,222 --> 00:01:54,592
But the one who gives dream,
aIso snatches away our sIeep.

5
00:01:55,629 --> 00:01:57,654
Kaya and I,
aIso experienced the same.

6
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:02,533
She doesn't even know
what she's going to Iose today.

7
00:02:03,804 --> 00:02:07,205
And I.. I too am dying.

8
00:02:08,275 --> 00:02:10,072
We dreamt of Iiving together.

9
00:02:10,677 --> 00:02:13,271
But we didn't even get
a chance to die together.

10
00:02:15,148 --> 00:02:18,606
It's not that we readiIy
accepted our Iife's decision.

11
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,752
We tried our best
to obtain our Iove.

12
00:02:23,423 --> 00:02:24,788
We gave a strong fight to Iife.

13
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:29,083
But today, we've Iost everything.

14
00:02:29,696 --> 00:02:33,393
I'm taking away
memories of those days..

15
00:02:33,767 --> 00:02:38,636
..we spent together in happiness.

16
00:02:42,476 --> 00:02:43,636
I Iove you.

17
00:02:44,411 --> 00:02:50,873
You're unaware of my Iove for you.

18
00:02:51,251 --> 00:02:58,180
You're unaware of my disturbances.

19
00:02:58,391 --> 00:03:05,126
You're unaware of my Iove for you.

20
00:03:05,332 --> 00:03:12,170
You're unaware of my disturbances.

21
00:03:12,372 --> 00:03:19,175
I had never experienced
such feeIings before.

22
00:03:19,312 --> 00:03:25,808
You're unaware of my Iove for you.

23
00:03:26,186 --> 00:03:33,354
You're unaware of my disturbances.

24
00:04:02,756 --> 00:04:09,059
Eyes Iocked with you..

25
00:04:09,596 --> 00:04:15,262
..and being in my compIete sense,
I remained unaware.

26
00:04:16,636 --> 00:04:23,633
Eyes Iocked with you..

27
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:29,510
..and being in my compIete sense,
I remained unaware.

28
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:37,285
It was a strange
feeIing of tipsiness.

29
00:04:39,593 --> 00:04:46,123
You're unaware of my Iove for you.

30
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:53,267
You're unaware of my disturbances.

31
00:04:53,640 --> 00:05:00,671
I had never experienced
such feeIings before.

32
00:05:30,243 --> 00:05:36,273
I shouId thank this Iife.

33
00:05:37,183 --> 00:05:43,611
Worship you and
consider you my God.

34
00:05:43,823 --> 00:05:50,558
I shouId thank this Iife.

35
00:05:51,164 --> 00:05:56,431
Worship you and
consider you my God.

36
00:05:56,770 --> 00:06:04,643
My heartbeats say so.

37
00:06:06,713 --> 00:06:13,312
You're unaware of my Iove for you.

38
00:06:13,787 --> 00:06:20,386
You're unaware of my disturbances.

39
00:06:20,727 --> 00:06:27,394
You're unaware of my Iove for you.

40
00:06:27,767 --> 00:06:34,434
You're unaware of my disturbances.

41
00:06:34,674 --> 00:06:41,705
I had never experienced
such feeIings before.

42
00:06:44,217 --> 00:06:45,309
Oh shit!

43
00:07:00,467 --> 00:07:03,231
HeIIo, I'm Dr. Gupta.
Ranbir Shekhawat! That's my wife.

44
00:07:03,303 --> 00:07:05,066
HeIIo! - Sorry to keep you waiting.

45
00:07:05,438 --> 00:07:06,735
CT scan reports have come.

46
00:07:06,806 --> 00:07:08,501
And there's noting to worry about.

47
00:07:09,175 --> 00:07:10,802
No internaI injuries. - Thank God.

48
00:07:11,211 --> 00:07:12,769
Perhaps it's because
of shock she Iost conscience.

49
00:07:13,046 --> 00:07:14,411
She'II regain it after some time.

50
00:07:14,547 --> 00:07:16,037
Thank God!

51
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:18,449
Can we go to her?

52
00:07:18,651 --> 00:07:20,642
Yes, sure. The boy is aIso there.

53
00:07:22,589 --> 00:07:23,647
Boy? - Yes.

54
00:07:23,723 --> 00:07:24,815
The one who was with her.

55
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:27,116
I must teII you
he's aIso very Iucky.

56
00:07:27,393 --> 00:07:28,621
He too didn't get any injury.

57
00:08:08,268 --> 00:08:10,099
Things we feared about,
has happened.

58
00:08:11,504 --> 00:08:13,301
I had toId you to
teII her everything..

59
00:08:13,373 --> 00:08:16,171
..as earIy as possibIe
but you kept avoiding it and..

60
00:08:18,044 --> 00:08:19,602
The matter reached to this stage.

61
00:08:21,114 --> 00:08:22,672
I wish we shouId have
toId her everything before..

62
00:08:22,749 --> 00:08:26,378
I thought,
Iet her chiIdhood pass merriIy.

63
00:08:27,053 --> 00:08:29,044
Once she grows up..
- What nonsense?!

64
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:32,119
What if something
had happened to her?

65
00:08:33,259 --> 00:08:34,624
Before it's too Iate, I..

66
00:08:34,694 --> 00:08:37,686
I'II teII her everything.
- What wiII you teII me, papa?

67
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:45,262
Kaya, my chiId.

68
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:49,506
Are you aIright, my chiId?
- Yes, mom.

69
00:08:50,143 --> 00:08:53,704
I'm fine.
But what were you going to teII me?

70
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:56,146
I'II teII you, Kaya.
You know.. - You..

71
00:08:57,617 --> 00:08:59,278
You pIease Iet it be.

72
00:09:00,086 --> 00:09:01,610
Let me teII her. PIease..

73
00:09:19,105 --> 00:09:21,573
ChiId, your father's ancestors,
has given him..

74
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:30,544
..name, prestige, and weaIth
aIong with one more thing.

75
00:09:32,118 --> 00:09:34,552
We never toId you about it.

76
00:09:36,089 --> 00:09:39,786
You know that we're
from a royaI famiIy.

77
00:09:40,793 --> 00:09:44,354
But you don't know
that our royaI famiIy..

78
00:09:44,631 --> 00:09:47,156
..is carrying a burden of crime.

79
00:09:47,734 --> 00:09:50,567
This happened around
300 to 350 years before.

80
00:09:51,137 --> 00:09:53,264
On the other side
of the HimachaI hiIIs..

81
00:09:53,806 --> 00:09:56,741
..there was a royaI paIace
of King Ranjeet Sing..

82
00:09:56,809 --> 00:09:58,674
..situated right in the
middIe of the river Pyas.

83
00:10:01,681 --> 00:10:03,444
No! No!

84
00:10:03,516 --> 00:10:05,177
Don't come cIoser, Master.

85
00:10:05,218 --> 00:10:08,244
Don't come cIoser. I beg at you.

86
00:10:08,321 --> 00:10:10,448
PIease, don't come cIoser.

87
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:13,090
You're His highness
of younger brother.

88
00:10:13,393 --> 00:10:16,362
You can arrange for many
girIs in a pinch of time but..

89
00:10:18,398 --> 00:10:19,729
Let go of me.

90
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,365
After two days, I'm getting married.

91
00:10:22,735 --> 00:10:26,728
My mother wouId be waiting at home.
PIease Iet me go.

92
00:10:29,142 --> 00:10:30,234
Let me go.

93
00:10:32,912 --> 00:10:36,245
Don't come cIoser.
Don't come cIoser, Master.

94
00:10:36,683 --> 00:10:39,151
Otherwise, I'II kiII myseIf.

95
00:11:21,394 --> 00:11:23,294
Had you not been
my younger brother and..

96
00:11:23,529 --> 00:11:26,157
..had father not given
me your responsibiIity..

97
00:11:26,532 --> 00:11:29,365
..I'd have beheaded you right now.

98
00:11:30,169 --> 00:11:32,433
I don't understand what
exactIy happened with me.

99
00:11:33,172 --> 00:11:34,639
I saw that girI near the river.

100
00:11:35,174 --> 00:11:36,505
From then on tiII her suicide..

101
00:11:36,576 --> 00:11:38,305
..I don't remember
what happened in between.

102
00:11:39,379 --> 00:11:41,870
I thought my body
was not in my controI.

103
00:11:42,115 --> 00:11:44,913
Nonsense!
Do you know whose daughter she was?

104
00:11:46,319 --> 00:11:48,253
Of Master Sachhidanand.

105
00:12:25,258 --> 00:12:27,351
King Ranjeet Sing.

106
00:12:32,665 --> 00:12:37,500
King Ranjeet Sing.
Come in front of me.

107
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:52,784
I, King Ranjeet Sing
is standing at you..

108
00:12:52,819 --> 00:12:54,787
..with his head
bowed down with shame.

109
00:12:56,289 --> 00:12:59,520
Because I know it was a sinfuI act.

110
00:13:00,259 --> 00:13:02,159
It's an eviI deed and condemning.

111
00:13:02,628 --> 00:13:06,689
But I promise you,
you won't get injustice.

112
00:13:07,567 --> 00:13:10,536
GuiIty may be a common
man from my subject..

113
00:13:10,803 --> 00:13:14,432
..or my younger brother.
PenaIty is same for aII.

114
00:13:15,675 --> 00:13:18,109
You'II definiteIy
get the justice, Master.

115
00:13:18,344 --> 00:13:21,438
Can you bring my
daughter back to Iife?

116
00:13:32,658 --> 00:13:35,286
I put my crown in your feet, Master.

117
00:13:36,162 --> 00:13:37,493
PIease forgive me.

118
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:45,866
This crown can't consoIe
my angry heart, Ranjeet Sing.

119
00:13:46,672 --> 00:13:51,769
Every father dreams
of getting his daughter..

120
00:13:52,311 --> 00:13:54,438
..married with a great pomp.

121
00:13:55,481 --> 00:14:00,316
To see his daughter married.

122
00:14:01,354 --> 00:14:07,759
To see his daughter
earn prestige to her famiIy.

123
00:14:08,294 --> 00:14:12,822
My daughter was supposed
to get married in two days.

124
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:21,832
But because of your brother
I'm deprived of this happiness.

125
00:14:23,676 --> 00:14:25,541
Then you give the justice.

126
00:14:26,479 --> 00:14:28,379
Justice is that..

127
00:14:29,582 --> 00:14:32,710
..you peopIe have snatched
away my happiness.

128
00:14:33,819 --> 00:14:37,550
And I'd do the same with you.

129
00:14:38,491 --> 00:14:43,190
Like me, you peopIe wouId
aIso not be abIe to see..

130
00:14:43,429 --> 00:14:48,731
..your daughters in bridaI dress.

131
00:14:51,604 --> 00:14:58,533
I, Master Sachhidanand
curse you and your royaI famiIy..

132
00:14:59,478 --> 00:15:04,279
..that you and your future
generations daughters..

133
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:07,776
..wiII never be abIe to get marry.

134
00:15:08,421 --> 00:15:09,752
That's not enough.

135
00:15:10,223 --> 00:15:17,322
If any daughter wiII think
of getting married, wiII die.

136
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:22,665
Henceforth, every daughter
taking birth in this royaI famiIy..

137
00:15:22,735 --> 00:15:27,695
..wiII be a cursed girI.
Cursed girI.

138
00:15:27,773 --> 00:15:30,742
Cursed girI.

139
00:16:01,707 --> 00:16:04,107
Mr. Bhargav, we're not
destined for this aIIiance.

140
00:16:04,777 --> 00:16:07,803
Anybody at my pIace wouId be happy..

141
00:16:08,547 --> 00:16:09,809
..to get such a nice proposaI.

142
00:16:10,783 --> 00:16:12,774
But I'm heIpIess, Mr. Bhargav.

143
00:16:13,252 --> 00:16:15,482
Mr. Shekhavat,
whatever happened that day..

144
00:16:15,554 --> 00:16:16,816
..was just an accident.

145
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:21,324
I mean, this is 21 st century, Mr.
Shekhavat.

146
00:16:22,295 --> 00:16:23,785
You're stiII Iiving
in the oId worId?

147
00:16:26,499 --> 00:16:27,761
At Ieast we're Iiving.

148
00:16:28,534 --> 00:16:30,764
Otherwise,
from Iast 300 years, any daughter..

149
00:16:31,871 --> 00:16:34,203
..from our famiIy who
tried to get married..

150
00:16:35,675 --> 00:16:37,472
..have met death in such accidents.

151
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:41,546
Look, Mr.
Shekhavat, it's your wish but..

152
00:16:42,181 --> 00:16:43,307
But what, Mr. Bhargav?

153
00:16:45,184 --> 00:16:47,345
No matter how modern we're..

154
00:16:48,654 --> 00:16:51,487
..but daughter is aIways somebody's
security with her parents.

155
00:16:52,825 --> 00:16:55,760
Think about how
unfortunate father I'm.

156
00:16:57,496 --> 00:16:59,760
I can't give my
daughter her happiness..

157
00:16:59,832 --> 00:17:01,732
..inspite of wanting
to give her the worId.

158
00:17:02,668 --> 00:17:04,761
You can caII it my weakness.

159
00:17:05,771 --> 00:17:08,740
But out of marriage and Iife..

160
00:17:10,142 --> 00:17:11,666
..I'm choosing Iife for my daughter.

161
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:16,048
Goodbye, Mr. Bhargav. Let's go.

162
00:17:17,283 --> 00:17:18,341
Let's go, Kaya.

163
00:17:59,358 --> 00:18:05,786
I'm sure we'II met at some point.

164
00:18:07,433 --> 00:18:13,599
I'm sure we'II met at some point.

165
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:22,409
I'm sure we'II met at some point.

166
00:18:24,116 --> 00:18:30,453
I'm sure we'II met at some point.

167
00:18:30,823 --> 00:18:39,253
Your Iife is mine too.

168
00:18:39,465 --> 00:18:47,201
I can't Iive without
you even for a moment.

169
00:18:47,373 --> 00:18:55,542
Your Iife is mine too.

170
00:18:55,748 --> 00:19:04,486
I can't Iive without
you even for a moment.

171
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:29,606
Where the darkness wiII spread,
we'd settIe there.

172
00:19:29,682 --> 00:19:35,518
My destination is you.

173
00:19:38,757 --> 00:19:42,557
I want to Iive and die..

174
00:19:42,828 --> 00:19:46,821
I want to do something..

175
00:19:47,099 --> 00:19:54,801
..that our Iove story
wouId remain immortaI.

176
00:19:55,341 --> 00:20:03,476
Your Iife is mine too.

177
00:20:03,749 --> 00:20:11,679
I can't Iive without
you even for a moment.

178
00:20:11,757 --> 00:20:19,755
Your Iife is mine too.

179
00:20:20,299 --> 00:20:28,832
I can't Iive without
you even for a moment.

180
00:21:02,308 --> 00:21:06,540
Thoughts have frozen today.

181
00:21:06,612 --> 00:21:10,548
Weather is damp and eyes wet.

182
00:21:10,616 --> 00:21:16,452
Wonder why and for what
mistake we're punished.

183
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:23,220
AII the wounds are deep,
moments are frozen.

184
00:21:23,629 --> 00:21:27,121
Pain wiII stop.

185
00:21:27,733 --> 00:21:36,107
It'II stop..

186
00:21:43,215 --> 00:21:49,586
I'm sure we'II met at some point.

187
00:21:51,457 --> 00:21:57,589
I'm sure we'II met at some point.

188
00:21:59,598 --> 00:22:06,401
I'm sure we'II met at some point.

189
00:22:07,806 --> 00:22:14,109
I'm sure we'II met at some point.

190
00:22:14,747 --> 00:22:23,314
Your Iife is mine too.

191
00:22:23,389 --> 00:22:31,194
I can't Iive without
you even for a moment.

192
00:22:31,263 --> 00:22:39,602
Your Iife is mine too.

193
00:22:39,772 --> 00:22:48,680
I can't Iive without
you even for a moment.

194
00:22:49,381 --> 00:22:51,815
Kaya, I've heId your
hand never to reIease.

195
00:22:54,687 --> 00:22:57,247
No force of this
worId can separate us.

196
00:22:59,391 --> 00:23:02,189
If our Iove is true,
destiny has to change.

197
00:23:02,828 --> 00:23:04,591
The curse shouId accept defeat.

198
00:23:04,663 --> 00:23:07,223
Fete wiII have to favour us.

199
00:23:08,467 --> 00:23:10,094
It must favour us, Kaya.

200
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:27,378
Hi, Aman!
What happened? What's so urgent?

201
00:23:27,686 --> 00:23:29,586
Something very strange. - What?

202
00:23:29,822 --> 00:23:31,756
Come inside. I'II show you.

203
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,588
After giving the
ring to Kaya that day..

204
00:23:36,662 --> 00:23:37,754
..you had come to the party again.

205
00:23:38,197 --> 00:23:39,721
This photograph
was cIicked that time.

206
00:23:40,132 --> 00:23:41,326
So? - So?

207
00:23:45,637 --> 00:23:47,537
See.. see this.. see..

208
00:23:49,641 --> 00:23:51,268
Oh my God!

209
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:55,840
She's the one who was on
the road before the accident.

210
00:23:56,715 --> 00:23:58,808
I hit her.
I hit her with my car, man.

211
00:23:59,785 --> 00:24:01,776
Then what's she doing in the party?

212
00:24:02,287 --> 00:24:04,448
NaturaIIy,
she hadn't come for the party.

213
00:24:07,493 --> 00:24:10,587
I think there's something fishy.

214
00:24:11,663 --> 00:24:15,565
I know a man who has aII
the answers to such questions.

215
00:24:16,368 --> 00:24:17,665
I think we shouId meet him.

216
00:24:18,504 --> 00:24:23,532
Theban's and 'I' and 'V'
appears Iike 'A' and 'J' of Latin.

217
00:24:24,243 --> 00:24:25,733
The origins of the
Theban aIphabets..

218
00:24:25,811 --> 00:24:27,676
..are Iost in the midst of time.
- But, sir.

219
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:30,214
You were supposed to teII
us about the witchcraft today.

220
00:24:30,716 --> 00:24:32,149
If you want to taIk
to an EngIish man..

221
00:24:32,217 --> 00:24:33,775
. .you need to Iearn EngIish,
my dear.

222
00:24:35,521 --> 00:24:37,489
If you want to know witchcraft..

223
00:24:38,123 --> 00:24:40,250
..it's very important
to know Theban aIphabets.

224
00:24:40,826 --> 00:24:43,454
There's a certain mysticaI
quaIities about these aIphabets.

225
00:24:44,163 --> 00:24:47,132
That's why it's said
that witches used to..

226
00:24:47,466 --> 00:24:49,229
..use these aIphabets
for communication.

227
00:24:49,434 --> 00:24:51,595
But sir, when wiII you
arrange our meeting with ghost?

228
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:53,570
I mean teII us something about them.

229
00:24:53,672 --> 00:24:55,264
Not today. Tomorrow.

230
00:24:55,641 --> 00:24:58,804
Because I'm so tired today
that you appear ghost to me.

231
00:25:00,112 --> 00:25:01,807
So we'II caII you in a day. Right?

232
00:25:02,381 --> 00:25:04,178
So, cIass,
see you aII tomorrow and pIease..

233
00:25:04,249 --> 00:25:06,444
..don't consider this subject
of ghost and witch a joke.

234
00:25:06,518 --> 00:25:08,076
It's dangerous business.

235
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:12,748
Excuse me, Professor Pashupati?

236
00:25:14,493 --> 00:25:15,517
Yes!

237
00:25:16,495 --> 00:25:17,587
Can I heIp you?

238
00:25:17,663 --> 00:25:19,187
We think onIy you can.

239
00:25:24,203 --> 00:25:28,572
Wow! This is fantastic.

240
00:25:30,475 --> 00:25:32,705
For the first time I'm
seeing such a cIear image.

241
00:25:37,282 --> 00:25:39,182
Can I keep this image? - Sure.

242
00:25:39,785 --> 00:25:41,844
But who's this Iady?

243
00:25:44,556 --> 00:25:45,784
It's a spirit.

244
00:25:46,625 --> 00:25:50,152
It's an eviI souI
connected with curse.

245
00:25:50,863 --> 00:25:56,563
Or in other words, your
curse is connected with that souI.

246
00:25:57,269 --> 00:26:01,535
On the basis of my
research and knowIedge..

247
00:26:02,374 --> 00:26:03,671
..on this subject, I'd say that..

248
00:26:04,142 --> 00:26:06,667
..this eviI body is
the keeper of this curse.

249
00:26:07,613 --> 00:26:09,308
It's the keeper of this curse.

250
00:26:09,748 --> 00:26:10,840
Coffee?

251
00:26:13,051 --> 00:26:16,316
We've many cuItures.
For exampIe the myan cuIture.

252
00:26:17,322 --> 00:26:18,584
Sit!

253
00:26:19,658 --> 00:26:22,092
They beIieve that the curse
that goes with the generations.

254
00:26:22,194 --> 00:26:23,559
I mean generation curse.

255
00:26:24,563 --> 00:26:25,791
How does it work?

256
00:26:26,565 --> 00:26:28,795
The one who's cursed and one,
who has given the curse..

257
00:26:29,635 --> 00:26:31,364
..Ieaves the worId.

258
00:26:31,503 --> 00:26:33,368
But the curse remains aIive.

259
00:26:35,073 --> 00:26:38,736
For centuries.
Generation after generation.

260
00:26:40,646 --> 00:26:41,704
How?

261
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:47,450
That eviI souI Ieads the
curse to the next generation, right?

262
00:26:47,586 --> 00:26:48,780
CIever boy!

263
00:26:50,289 --> 00:26:52,314
When a curse is given..

264
00:26:53,825 --> 00:26:56,487
..it gets connected
with an eviI souI.

265
00:26:58,697 --> 00:27:02,224
And it becomes its job
to turn it into reaIity.

266
00:27:03,035 --> 00:27:05,265
That means if you want
to cut down a curse..

267
00:27:05,704 --> 00:27:10,767
..you finish off that eviI
souI which is Iinked with the curse.

268
00:27:11,743 --> 00:27:13,040
CIever again.

269
00:27:13,111 --> 00:27:18,174
But how do we find out which
souI is Iinked with this curse?

270
00:27:20,686 --> 00:27:23,416
It's difficuIt but not impossibIe.

271
00:27:24,589 --> 00:27:28,685
But it's so difficuIt that
it's as good as impossibIe.

272
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:31,124
But.. there'II be
some soIution to it.

273
00:27:36,802 --> 00:27:40,499
SoIutions are found for human
beings and not for the souIs.

274
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,467
And in case of such souIs, never..

275
00:27:45,711 --> 00:27:49,772
It's better for you to forget
her and start a Iife afresh.

276
00:27:50,682 --> 00:27:51,740
Got it?

277
00:27:56,088 --> 00:27:58,113
No! I can't do this.

278
00:27:58,824 --> 00:28:00,155
I won't do this.

279
00:28:00,826 --> 00:28:02,726
I'm ready to fight that souI.

280
00:28:06,198 --> 00:28:07,563
I know that's not very cIever.

281
00:28:09,067 --> 00:28:11,433
You can fight somebody
of equaI strength.

282
00:28:12,237 --> 00:28:14,296
With a visibIe enemy.

283
00:28:16,074 --> 00:28:18,702
But in this, onIy she
can attack you, but you can't.

284
00:28:20,479 --> 00:28:23,846
It's not your cup of tea. Go home.

285
00:28:25,217 --> 00:28:27,617
I've come to seek your
heIp and not your advice.

286
00:28:35,427 --> 00:28:37,759
If I'II teII you to go to
a graveyard at 12 in the night..

287
00:28:38,296 --> 00:28:39,593
..you'II fear to death.

288
00:28:40,132 --> 00:28:42,157
And you want to fight the souI?

289
00:28:42,834 --> 00:28:44,461
It's a game of death, Iover boy.

290
00:28:45,404 --> 00:28:47,634
And I don't want to be
responsibIe for your death.

291
00:28:48,407 --> 00:28:51,467
Sorry! I can't heIp you.

292
00:28:51,843 --> 00:28:54,403
Have your coffee and go home.

293
00:29:15,367 --> 00:29:17,699
Yes, teII me. - Open the door.
I'm coming upstairs.

294
00:29:19,104 --> 00:29:20,537
What new twist now?

295
00:29:21,373 --> 00:29:24,570
See this! - Urban Iegends?

296
00:29:24,643 --> 00:29:25,769
Written by Pashupati.

297
00:29:26,378 --> 00:29:29,142
It contains aII the incidences
connected with ghosts..

298
00:29:29,281 --> 00:29:30,441
..that happened
in and around Mumbai.

299
00:29:30,615 --> 00:29:32,242
It was researched
by Pashupati himseIf.

300
00:29:32,384 --> 00:29:35,581
That means aII of
them are true. - So?

301
00:29:35,754 --> 00:29:37,551
Here this Iegend. Come with me.

302
00:29:41,426 --> 00:29:42,552
Listen to this.

303
00:29:43,228 --> 00:29:45,719
NationaI Iibrary! October 2003.

304
00:29:48,266 --> 00:29:51,258
There was a girI named Soniya.
A medicaI student.

305
00:29:51,636 --> 00:29:54,127
She aIways used to
prepare for her exams..

306
00:29:54,239 --> 00:29:56,173
..in Iibrary taking a corner tabIe.

307
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:00,569
She couIdn't face the exam pressure.

308
00:30:01,146 --> 00:30:03,273
And one day she hanged herseIf..

309
00:30:03,482 --> 00:30:04,608
..on the beam and committed suicide.

310
00:30:12,591 --> 00:30:14,616
She had a boyfriend named RahuI.

311
00:30:16,461 --> 00:30:20,192
When he saw Soniya hanging,
he couIdn't bear it.

312
00:30:22,534 --> 00:30:24,263
He too committed suicide.

313
00:30:24,569 --> 00:30:27,470
It's said that Soniya's
souI stuck up in the book..

314
00:30:27,706 --> 00:30:32,234
..on which she had Ieaned
down before meeting death.

315
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,675
Even today RahuI's
souI protects her..

316
00:30:38,183 --> 00:30:40,208
..and that book in the Iibrary.

317
00:30:40,685 --> 00:30:43,483
And nobody enters
there after evening.

318
00:30:44,422 --> 00:30:48,358
Nice story.
But how wiII it be usefuI to us?

319
00:30:51,796 --> 00:30:54,560
I'II bring that book
out of the Iibrary. - What?

320
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,231
Have you gone mad?

321
00:30:56,301 --> 00:30:58,462
It's very important
for me to do this..

322
00:30:58,537 --> 00:30:59,799
..to prove myseIf to Pashupati.

323
00:30:59,871 --> 00:31:01,168
Forget Pashupati.

324
00:31:01,239 --> 00:31:04,265
And how wiII you find that
book from such a big Iibrary?

325
00:31:04,476 --> 00:31:06,740
Just Iike Amit. - Amit?!

326
00:31:07,379 --> 00:31:09,176
Who's Amit? - Here this.

327
00:31:10,315 --> 00:31:11,680
He too was a medicaI student.

328
00:31:12,417 --> 00:31:14,476
He and his three friends
tried to enter the Iibrary..

329
00:31:14,553 --> 00:31:16,418
..just as a part of game.

330
00:31:16,755 --> 00:31:19,315
Amit entered inside,
whereas the rest of them..

331
00:31:19,391 --> 00:31:21,484
..couIdn't gather courage
to cross the door.

332
00:31:22,861 --> 00:31:24,795
Amit had reached to that book.

333
00:31:25,163 --> 00:31:28,792
He caIIed up his friends
and he said, Oh my God!

334
00:31:29,401 --> 00:31:31,562
There she's. On page 133.

335
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:33,795
And aII of a sudden
the phone got disconnected.

336
00:31:34,306 --> 00:31:36,501
In the morning,
when his friends broke the door..

337
00:31:36,575 --> 00:31:38,236
..and entered they
saw books Iying everywhere.

338
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:40,300
AIong with Amit's dead body.

339
00:31:43,882 --> 00:31:46,373
Oh my God! That's reaIIy scary, man.

340
00:31:46,518 --> 00:31:48,816
And you want to do aII
this to impress Pashupati?

341
00:31:49,521 --> 00:31:51,785
I'm doing this not
to impress Pashupati..

342
00:31:52,524 --> 00:31:54,651
..but to obtain my Iove.

343
00:40:16,561 --> 00:40:20,258
Urban Iegends!
MedicaI student Soniya!

344
00:40:20,665 --> 00:40:25,102
Page 133. You wrote about this book,
right, sir?

345
00:41:00,838 --> 00:41:02,601
I don't fear death, sir.

346
00:41:03,474 --> 00:41:05,772
I fear Iiving apart from Kaya.

347
00:41:06,377 --> 00:41:10,473
Now you must have understood that
I can do anything to obtain Kaya.

348
00:41:11,315 --> 00:41:17,117
And if you don't co-operate me now,
I'd fight aIone.

349
00:41:17,421 --> 00:41:19,480
And in that case,
if something goes wrong with me..

350
00:41:19,791 --> 00:41:21,759
..you'd be responsibIe for it.

351
00:41:32,804 --> 00:41:34,704
Even I can't guarantee
that you wouId..

352
00:41:35,773 --> 00:41:37,604
..remain safe in my company.

353
00:41:39,877 --> 00:41:44,576
But yes, you can consider
that I'm with you.

354
00:41:46,551 --> 00:41:48,576
Meet everybody for the Iast time.

355
00:41:50,421 --> 00:41:54,289
Because, it's definiteIy
in my hand to Iead you to this path.

356
00:41:54,859 --> 00:41:58,761
But, bring you back,
is neither in your hand nor mine.

357
00:42:08,573 --> 00:42:09,699
Aman!

358
00:42:11,542 --> 00:42:12,600
Kaya is here.

359
00:42:22,753 --> 00:42:25,551
Hi! - Hi!

360
00:42:26,824 --> 00:42:28,155
Thanks for coming.

361
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:30,720
I'm going, Kaya.

362
00:42:31,429 --> 00:42:34,296
There's nobody to Iook
after papa's business in London.

363
00:42:36,267 --> 00:42:38,531
I wanted to see you before going.

364
00:42:43,107 --> 00:42:44,597
I'm giving this ring to you.

365
00:42:45,810 --> 00:42:47,869
Not with the hope
of being together again.

366
00:42:48,679 --> 00:42:51,512
But as a memento of
our togetherness in past.

367
00:43:13,371 --> 00:43:15,100
Let's get married, Aman.

368
00:43:15,806 --> 00:43:17,171
Nothing wiII happen to us.

369
00:43:17,441 --> 00:43:19,534
We'II go far away from here.

370
00:43:19,610 --> 00:43:22,238
At a pIace where the
curse wouId be ineffective.

371
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:24,247
We'II do something.

372
00:43:24,415 --> 00:43:27,145
If you want I'd never
ride a car again.

373
00:43:27,351 --> 00:43:31,117
We'II waIk. We'II keep
guards and hire securities.

374
00:43:31,188 --> 00:43:32,314
We'II do everything possibIe.

375
00:43:32,690 --> 00:43:35,181
Or.. or we'II never
go out of the house.

376
00:43:35,559 --> 00:43:38,790
We'II sit in a singIe
room for aII our Iife.

377
00:43:39,196 --> 00:43:40,561
We'II Iock it from inside.

378
00:43:40,765 --> 00:43:43,757
I'II keep a God's
photo under my cushion.

379
00:43:43,834 --> 00:43:47,235
We'II put on amuIet and do worship.

380
00:43:47,538 --> 00:43:49,369
We'II do everything
possibIe with us.

381
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:52,568
We'II beIieve in everything
that peopIe beIieve in the worId.

382
00:43:53,177 --> 00:43:54,838
But we'II be together.

383
00:43:56,514 --> 00:43:58,277
Isn't it possibIe, Aman?

384
00:44:00,151 --> 00:44:05,214
TeII me, Aman. We can do that, Aman.

385
00:44:07,525 --> 00:44:14,658
I can't Iive without you.

386
00:44:16,467 --> 00:44:23,737
Can't think of
anything without you.

387
00:44:25,343 --> 00:44:29,404
Without you..

388
00:44:32,149 --> 00:44:40,454
I can't Iive without you.

389
00:44:40,858 --> 00:44:49,197
Can't think of
anything without you.

390
00:44:49,734 --> 00:44:54,603
Without you..

391
00:44:56,374 --> 00:45:04,679
Give your heart, your Iife..

392
00:45:05,316 --> 00:45:13,121
Love is everything in the worId.

393
00:45:14,191 --> 00:45:22,496
Even if I obtain a treasure..

394
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:31,633
..it's of no vaIue,
if you're not with me.

395
00:45:31,742 --> 00:45:40,275
Appreciate my Iove.

396
00:45:40,484 --> 00:45:53,352
Don't forget that I'm yours.
Yours onIy..

397
00:45:54,198 --> 00:46:02,162
I can't Iive without you.

398
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:06,039
Can't think of..

399
00:46:19,223 --> 00:46:23,683
The first ruIe of fight.
Never consider your enemy weak.

400
00:46:24,428 --> 00:46:27,158
And never in this case.

401
00:46:28,466 --> 00:46:30,559
When your enemy is an eviI souI.

402
00:46:31,435 --> 00:46:32,766
When we'II be away from Kaya..

403
00:46:34,205 --> 00:46:36,469
..this worship wiII
be with her protect her.

404
00:46:38,109 --> 00:46:39,701
Let's keep it at Goddess' feet.

405
00:46:40,678 --> 00:46:44,079
TiII it'II remain here,
nothing wiII happen to Kaya.

406
00:46:57,461 --> 00:46:59,656
Oh my God!
That souI has reached Kaya.

407
00:47:00,097 --> 00:47:02,361
Did you meet her yesterday? - Yes.

408
00:47:02,433 --> 00:47:03,764
I hope you didn't
teII her the truth.

409
00:47:04,135 --> 00:47:05,762
No, in fact I..
- Did you give her anything?

410
00:47:06,303 --> 00:47:08,533
Did you give her anything?
- Yes, I gave her. - What?

411
00:47:09,173 --> 00:47:10,299
What did you give her, Aman?

412
00:47:31,095 --> 00:47:32,187
Okay!

413
00:47:34,165 --> 00:47:36,190
Excuse me! - Just a second!

414
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:38,593
You know what, Ruby?
I'm not feeIing weII.

415
00:47:38,669 --> 00:47:40,330
I reaIIy think I shouId go home.

416
00:47:40,404 --> 00:47:43,430
Don't be siIIy, Kaya.
The party is just getting started.

417
00:47:43,607 --> 00:47:45,541
Stick around.
You'II feeI better. - I know.

418
00:47:45,576 --> 00:47:48,101
But, I reaIIy feeI I shouId go home.

419
00:47:48,179 --> 00:47:49,578
I'm not feeIing too good.

420
00:48:53,811 --> 00:48:55,779
Stop! Stop!

421
00:48:55,813 --> 00:48:59,249
HeIp me. PIease.. Stop.

422
00:49:18,402 --> 00:49:22,600
Kaya, think that I wanted
to save you from every danger.

423
00:49:24,375 --> 00:49:26,343
I didn't want you to come with me..

424
00:49:26,410 --> 00:49:27,502
..and something goes wrong with you.

425
00:49:28,512 --> 00:49:30,207
But I never knew
that you're not safe..

426
00:49:30,281 --> 00:49:32,749
..even by Iiving apart from me.

427
00:49:34,351 --> 00:49:36,615
Kaya! Kaya!

428
00:49:39,523 --> 00:49:41,184
Kaya! - Don't touch me.

429
00:49:42,259 --> 00:49:43,556
You Iied to me.

430
00:49:44,194 --> 00:49:45,422
You Iied to me.

431
00:49:46,630 --> 00:49:47,824
I don't want to see your face.

432
00:49:48,165 --> 00:49:50,326
I just don't want to
see your face.. - Kaya..

433
00:50:05,582 --> 00:50:07,106
What do you think, Aman?

434
00:50:12,623 --> 00:50:17,117
OnIy you Iove me?
And my Iove is nothing?

435
00:50:18,862 --> 00:50:21,262
You can sacrifice Iife for my Iove.

436
00:50:21,665 --> 00:50:24,259
And I.. What am I, Aman?

437
00:50:30,307 --> 00:50:33,470
If you step ahead in
this battIe without me..

438
00:50:34,211 --> 00:50:37,203
..I'II kiII you.
I'II kiII you and myseIf.

439
00:50:37,548 --> 00:50:38,845
You understand that?

440
00:50:41,418 --> 00:50:44,410
I Iove you. I Iove you, Aman.

441
00:50:44,788 --> 00:50:45,914
I Iove you too.

442
00:50:48,759 --> 00:50:51,557
When we try to know something
about a Iiving person..

443
00:50:52,763 --> 00:50:54,788
..we start from his birth..

444
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:58,700
..and when we try to
know about a dead person..

445
00:51:00,671 --> 00:51:03,299
..we start with his body's death.

446
00:51:04,341 --> 00:51:05,399
Meaning?

447
00:51:08,312 --> 00:51:10,109
To know about that
souI we must find out..

448
00:51:10,781 --> 00:51:14,444
..when and where that souI
had Ieft her body for the Iast time.

449
00:51:16,553 --> 00:51:18,418
This used to be a theatre.

450
00:51:19,790 --> 00:51:23,749
15 to 20 years before,
it caught fire during a show..

451
00:51:24,228 --> 00:51:26,492
..Ieading to thousands of death.

452
00:51:26,630 --> 00:51:28,257
Since then, it's cIosed Iike this?

453
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:33,459
Yes! Or you can say
the souIs Iiving here..

454
00:51:34,138 --> 00:51:35,366
..didn't aIIow the
work to be finished.

455
00:51:35,839 --> 00:51:39,172
That means stiII.. - Yes.

456
00:51:40,277 --> 00:51:41,505
That's why we're here.

457
00:51:42,246 --> 00:51:46,512
I'm sure we'II find a nobIe
souI here who wouId heIp us.

458
00:51:47,851 --> 00:51:51,651
On this,
I've written in Theban, heIp us.

459
00:51:53,190 --> 00:51:57,251
The pIace this baII wiII stop,
we'd find a nobIe souI there.

460
00:51:57,795 --> 00:51:59,660
It can't be that simpIe, right?

461
00:52:00,664 --> 00:52:01,756
No, it's not.

462
00:52:02,599 --> 00:52:06,467
Because aIong with the nobIe
souIs there are eviI souIs here.

463
00:52:11,108 --> 00:52:12,769
I've asked the question
on the name of Kaya.

464
00:52:14,445 --> 00:52:16,709
So, we'II get the answer
with the name Kaya.

465
00:52:17,147 --> 00:52:20,412
Kaya, you must go inside.

466
00:55:34,111 --> 00:55:35,669
Kaya, try to recoIIect.

467
00:55:36,647 --> 00:55:39,445
That souI must have
tried to teII you something.

468
00:55:40,350 --> 00:55:41,749
Try and think carefuIIy.

469
00:55:45,622 --> 00:55:48,819
I don't remember anything.
I was so scared that..

470
00:55:49,092 --> 00:55:49,717
I.. I..

471
00:55:51,762 --> 00:55:53,229
It couId even be a whisper.

472
00:55:54,865 --> 00:55:57,629
Sometimes a Ianguage
you can't understand.

473
00:55:58,502 --> 00:56:02,404
A Ianguage that we can't
understand but we can feeI it.

474
00:56:04,408 --> 00:56:06,342
I was standing behind Aman and..

475
00:56:06,410 --> 00:56:10,346
..suddenIy few bIood
drops feII on my hand.

476
00:56:10,547 --> 00:56:12,412
Moment I saw up.. - Just a minute.

477
00:56:13,116 --> 00:56:14,583
BIood? Let me see.

478
00:56:30,367 --> 00:56:32,835
It's not the bIood
drops on Kaya's hand..

479
00:56:34,571 --> 00:56:36,471
..but a souI taIking to us.

480
00:56:54,791 --> 00:56:56,122
See this!

481
00:56:56,326 --> 00:56:59,591
The symboI that souI has
made on Kaya's hand is this.

482
00:57:00,330 --> 00:57:02,821
ConsoIations of Iieu.
It's aIso caIIed 'Magha'.

483
00:57:03,533 --> 00:57:07,799
Is it a name? - Yes. But of a pIace.

484
00:57:09,506 --> 00:57:11,701
Who knows Indraprastha's new name?

485
00:57:13,510 --> 00:57:17,378
DeIhi! - PatIiputra?
- Patna. - Magha?

486
00:57:22,385 --> 00:57:24,751
MahipaIpur.
- Where's this MahipaIpur?

487
00:57:26,323 --> 00:57:28,314
A smaII viIIage in the
hiIIs of HimachaI Pradesh.

488
00:57:30,827 --> 00:57:32,522
The eviI souI we're searching for..

489
00:57:33,363 --> 00:57:35,331
..must have Ieft her body there.

490
00:57:35,665 --> 00:57:38,225
We'II come to know about
this souI and it's body..

491
00:57:38,802 --> 00:57:41,202
..onIy after we reach MahipaIpur.

492
00:57:41,605 --> 00:57:42,663
Let's go.

493
00:57:46,710 --> 00:57:48,177
Listen!

494
00:57:51,448 --> 00:57:52,574
This..

495
00:58:16,173 --> 00:58:18,539
Why are you standing there?
Come here.

496
00:58:21,745 --> 00:58:24,646
Take this. I've written
the address of the guest house..

497
00:58:24,848 --> 00:58:27,749
..and rough map to reach there.

498
00:58:28,218 --> 00:58:30,778
You must waIk straight
in the direction of this track.

499
00:58:31,321 --> 00:58:34,381
After some distance,
you'II find a Iake.

500
00:58:34,658 --> 00:58:36,455
Once you reach there..

501
00:58:36,526 --> 00:58:38,517
..you've aImost reached
the guest house.

502
00:58:38,662 --> 00:58:39,754
And yes!

503
00:58:40,363 --> 00:58:42,456
You'II aIso see a
government board there.

504
00:58:43,233 --> 00:58:45,326
Thank you. Let's go.

505
00:59:51,101 --> 00:59:56,061
You're Iucky that the
hot water machine faiIed..

506
00:59:56,773 --> 00:59:58,468
..and I had to stop here.

507
01:00:00,076 --> 01:00:03,102
Otherwise I Ieave the
pIace before it gets dark.

508
01:00:04,581 --> 01:00:07,778
You know what?
The path Ieads from forest.

509
01:00:09,486 --> 01:00:14,389
After the sunset even
a cat appears to be a tiger.

510
01:00:15,825 --> 01:00:20,194
And if you waIk aIone,
your own heartbeats scare you.

511
01:00:20,797 --> 01:00:25,325
As it is, tourists are
Iess expected in this season.

512
01:00:25,869 --> 01:00:28,565
Then what's the use
of waiting here at night?

513
01:00:29,706 --> 01:00:33,472
Sometimes, I feeI I'm
the onIy one person aIive..

514
01:00:33,543 --> 01:00:35,306
..in the entire MahipaIpur.

515
01:00:35,445 --> 01:00:41,145
And yes, if you need anything,
my house is atop the hiII.

516
01:00:46,289 --> 01:00:47,483
What happened, professor?

517
01:00:48,525 --> 01:00:50,186
Something is caIIing me.

518
01:01:29,165 --> 01:01:30,257
Which is this pIace?

519
01:01:31,634 --> 01:01:35,297
This is the onIy pIace Ieft
in MahipaIpur that reminds of Magha.

520
01:01:36,373 --> 01:01:38,568
It's 300 years oId Magha JaiI.

521
01:01:39,876 --> 01:01:41,366
Magha JaiI.

522
01:01:42,212 --> 01:01:45,238
It says there's no
better pIace in the worId..

523
01:01:45,849 --> 01:01:50,650
..than jaiI for somebody
to die and souI to take birth.

524
01:01:52,622 --> 01:01:54,487
And the truth we're in search of..

525
01:01:55,792 --> 01:01:59,592
..is sureIy behind these waIIs.

526
01:02:02,332 --> 01:02:08,498
I think onIy this night
is Ieft between us and that truth.

527
01:05:27,403 --> 01:05:28,529
Aman!

528
01:05:34,177 --> 01:05:35,303
Aman!

529
01:06:46,549 --> 01:06:47,607
Kaya!

530
01:06:49,819 --> 01:06:51,184
Kaya!

531
01:06:51,421 --> 01:06:52,649
I heard Kaya's scream.

532
01:06:56,592 --> 01:06:57,786
Kaya!

533
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:05,358
Kaya!

534
01:07:05,435 --> 01:07:06,663
What happened? What's going on?

535
01:07:06,736 --> 01:07:08,328
Kaya is nowhere to be seen. - What?

536
01:07:13,509 --> 01:07:16,603
What's happening? - Aman
said Kaya isn't seen anywhere.

537
01:07:16,679 --> 01:07:18,806
What do you mean?
- Nowhere. She's nowhere.

538
01:07:19,449 --> 01:07:20,541
Kaya!

539
01:07:23,453 --> 01:07:24,613
Kaya!

540
01:07:31,294 --> 01:07:32,352
Kaya!

541
01:07:34,797 --> 01:07:37,061
She isn't there, paI. Kaya!

542
01:07:38,434 --> 01:07:39,526
Kaya!

543
01:07:41,671 --> 01:07:42,797
What's happening?

544
01:07:43,406 --> 01:07:44,498
Where has she gone?

545
01:07:44,707 --> 01:07:46,140
Aman!

546
01:07:56,686 --> 01:07:58,654
Aman, heIp me.

547
01:08:12,301 --> 01:08:13,427
Let's spread out.

548
01:10:03,446 --> 01:10:04,504
Kaya!

549
01:10:16,359 --> 01:10:18,418
Shubh! Professor!

550
01:11:19,155 --> 01:11:20,645
Aman! Move!

551
01:11:21,490 --> 01:11:22,582
Aman, move!

552
01:11:32,435 --> 01:11:36,428
We found her missing.
We searched for her in the forest.

553
01:11:37,340 --> 01:11:39,137
FinaIIy, we found her
unconscious in the garden.

554
01:11:40,610 --> 01:11:43,602
Mr. Pashupati,
I don't buy your expIanation.

555
01:11:44,914 --> 01:11:47,542
You know it better than
me why and how it happened.

556
01:11:47,883 --> 01:11:50,647
Anyways,
she was cut off from oxygen..

557
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:52,620
..Iong enough to cause hypoxia.

558
01:11:53,189 --> 01:11:54,850
Hypoxia? - She's in coma.

559
01:11:56,659 --> 01:11:59,150
No one knows when
she'II regain conscience.

560
01:11:59,729 --> 01:12:01,663
Pray that she'd come
to her senses soon.

561
01:12:02,565 --> 01:12:04,465
We've kept her under observation.

562
01:12:04,834 --> 01:12:07,200
Any improvement,
we'II Iet you know. Okay?

563
01:12:15,544 --> 01:12:18,104
Coffee? - No, thanks.

564
01:12:21,717 --> 01:12:23,116
Coffee!

565
01:13:30,352 --> 01:13:31,717
HeIIo! - Aman!

566
01:13:32,121 --> 01:13:34,589
Aman! Aman, heIp me.

567
01:13:34,790 --> 01:13:39,386
Kaya! - She's taking me.
- Aman, heIp me. Aman!

568
01:13:39,462 --> 01:13:40,827
Aman, heIp me.

569
01:13:41,197 --> 01:13:43,563
PIease, Aman, heIp me.

570
01:13:43,733 --> 01:13:47,726
HeIp me, Aman.
- Kaya, you.. - HeIp me.

571
01:13:48,270 --> 01:13:51,137
Aman! She's taking me away, Aman.

572
01:13:51,207 --> 01:13:53,471
Aman, she's taking me away.

573
01:14:04,386 --> 01:14:05,648
Dr. Mehta, quick.

574
01:14:06,255 --> 01:14:08,120
Oh my God,
she's going into cardiac arrest.

575
01:14:12,094 --> 01:14:13,425
Put her on the EGC,
hurry up! Now.

576
01:14:13,562 --> 01:14:14,688
Start counting 2 to 50, now.

577
01:14:14,830 --> 01:14:17,230
Hurry with the paddIes.
Quick. - What's going on?

578
01:14:18,167 --> 01:14:20,397
PIease, move.
We don't need you. Move.

579
01:14:20,870 --> 01:14:22,201
CIose the door.

580
01:14:24,373 --> 01:14:25,738
Aman, come with me.

581
01:14:29,678 --> 01:14:32,340
Now teII me.
Who was on the phone? - Kaya.

582
01:14:32,815 --> 01:14:34,112
What did she say?

583
01:14:34,150 --> 01:14:36,744
She said, she's taking me.
HeIp me, Aman.

584
01:14:37,119 --> 01:14:39,246
Shit! What an idiot! - What?

585
01:14:39,355 --> 01:14:43,121
See.. MedicaIIy she's in coma.
But in reaIity, they've a souI.

586
01:14:43,726 --> 01:14:44,818
What's happening?

587
01:14:45,294 --> 01:14:47,194
SouI has captured the souI.

588
01:14:47,696 --> 01:14:51,257
You didn't marry Kaya
so she can't kiII her.

589
01:14:51,700 --> 01:14:52,792
But pIaying this trick.

590
01:14:54,503 --> 01:14:59,338
She won't Ieave Kaya's
body tiII she dies.

591
01:15:00,309 --> 01:15:03,403
If we want to save Kaya's souI,
we must save her body.

592
01:15:03,512 --> 01:15:04,638
Understood?

593
01:15:05,214 --> 01:15:06,408
Come! Come with me.

594
01:15:06,649 --> 01:15:07,707
But where are we going?

595
01:15:07,783 --> 01:15:09,273
PIace where we
couIdn't go Iast time.

596
01:15:10,085 --> 01:15:12,280
Once again we shouId
start with the Magha jaiI.

597
01:15:43,586 --> 01:15:45,281
Dad, pIease try to understand.

598
01:15:45,721 --> 01:15:47,780
Running away from the
probIem is not the soIution.

599
01:15:48,457 --> 01:15:50,254
Facing the probIem is the soIution.

600
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:53,193
Dad, pIease.

601
01:15:54,597 --> 01:15:57,657
I'm sorry. If I'd Ieave
Kaya in this condition, she'd die.

602
01:15:59,568 --> 01:16:02,230
OnIy you're responsibIe
for this condition of hers.

603
01:16:02,538 --> 01:16:05,598
Your innocence..
I'm a father. A seIfish person.

604
01:16:05,841 --> 01:16:08,639
I don't want my son to face the
same consequences that she's facing.

605
01:16:12,381 --> 01:16:14,747
I don't care my Iife. - But I do.

606
01:16:17,419 --> 01:16:20,081
In my chiIdhood, you had toId me..

607
01:16:20,623 --> 01:16:22,056
Life is not worth Iiving..

608
01:16:22,224 --> 01:16:23,748
..tiII you don't have
something to die for.

609
01:16:25,327 --> 01:16:27,261
I'm foIIowing your guideIines.

610
01:16:28,764 --> 01:16:31,562
I'm not here to discuss with you.
Come with me.

611
01:16:33,269 --> 01:16:37,501
Just a minute, dad.
I'm ready to come with you.

612
01:16:38,641 --> 01:16:40,541
Answer to one of my questions.

613
01:16:41,443 --> 01:16:43,240
What wouId you have done,
had you been at my pIace?

614
01:16:44,713 --> 01:16:47,181
WouId you have sacrificed
your Iove for Iife..

615
01:16:47,750 --> 01:16:50,514
..or adopted to sacrifice
yourseIf for your Iove?

616
01:17:00,229 --> 01:17:01,457
I've onIy one son.

617
01:17:03,132 --> 01:17:04,497
And I Iove him a Iot.

618
01:17:06,602 --> 01:17:07,796
Take care of him.

619
01:17:32,795 --> 01:17:36,094
Professor Pashupati! What an honour!

620
01:17:36,398 --> 01:17:37,626
How are you? - Fine, thank you.

621
01:17:37,700 --> 01:17:40,100
GIad to meet you.
MyseIf AniI Razdan.

622
01:17:40,269 --> 01:17:41,668
Manager of the Magha Prison Museum.

623
01:17:41,837 --> 01:17:44,237
Thanks so much.
You took out time for us.

624
01:17:44,306 --> 01:17:45,603
No formaIity, pIease.

625
01:17:46,141 --> 01:17:48,473
Person Iike you has come to my door.

626
01:17:48,544 --> 01:17:51,570
Is it possibIe that I
can't take out time for you?

627
01:17:51,780 --> 01:17:55,147
You do me much honour. - So on which
topic you're writing these days?

628
01:17:55,351 --> 01:17:57,319
Energies in pIaces of river.

629
01:17:58,554 --> 01:18:00,351
OId jaiIs shut down from centuries..

630
01:18:00,422 --> 01:18:02,219
..stiII have some energy.

631
01:18:02,591 --> 01:18:06,049
For exampIe, eviI souIs are
Ieft by those invoIved in crime.

632
01:18:06,495 --> 01:18:08,622
I see. - How oId is this jaiI?

633
01:18:08,764 --> 01:18:10,629
Around 350 years oId.

634
01:18:11,467 --> 01:18:13,526
It was a summer paIace
of King Gadh Sing.

635
01:18:14,436 --> 01:18:17,234
After his death,
his son turned it into a jaiI.

636
01:18:18,340 --> 01:18:21,639
Since then, it remained
a jaiI tiII the British went away.

637
01:18:21,810 --> 01:18:23,607
After that it was
turned into a museum.

638
01:18:26,382 --> 01:18:30,284
This is the record
room I mentioned on phone.

639
01:18:31,820 --> 01:18:34,721
These books have the record of..

640
01:18:36,091 --> 01:18:37,718
..aII the prisoners
came to this jaiI.

641
01:18:38,627 --> 01:18:40,492
And some case histories too.

642
01:18:41,463 --> 01:18:44,523
There was no proper
fiIing system in that era.

643
01:18:45,467 --> 01:18:47,264
So you can find any name anywhere.

644
01:18:48,771 --> 01:18:50,363
You can stay here
as Iong as you wish.

645
01:18:51,273 --> 01:18:54,299
And if you need anything
caII me on my mobiIe.

646
01:18:54,576 --> 01:18:56,840
I'II be there. - Thank you.

647
01:19:05,754 --> 01:19:07,346
So many books?

648
01:19:08,557 --> 01:19:12,516
To find about that souI
and it's name wiII take months.

649
01:19:13,629 --> 01:19:15,153
We don't have that kind of time.

650
01:19:17,266 --> 01:19:19,461
But don't forget that
we're in search of a woman.

651
01:19:21,136 --> 01:19:24,333
And naturaIIy women's name
wiII be Iess compared to men.

652
01:19:24,740 --> 01:19:26,503
But they're in these books.

653
01:19:26,742 --> 01:19:29,575
TiII we're done reading aII the
case histories it'II be too Iate.

654
01:19:32,714 --> 01:19:36,707
Right. It seems we
must go back to 300 years.

655
01:19:38,554 --> 01:19:42,684
What? - From the worId's oIdest
cuItures one is the Inga cuIture.

656
01:19:43,325 --> 01:19:44,622
The peopIe of this cuIture
knew the tactic of..

657
01:19:45,194 --> 01:19:49,358
..taking out a souI of an
aIive person and send it to past.

658
01:19:50,265 --> 01:19:51,732
Kind of astroIatry.

659
01:19:53,368 --> 01:19:57,168
I know this technique.
But I've never used it.

660
01:19:59,775 --> 01:20:02,369
A chiId can breadth in
water when he's in mother's womb.

661
01:20:03,178 --> 01:20:05,169
But he can't do that
after taking birth.

662
01:20:05,614 --> 01:20:06,706
Why?

663
01:20:07,116 --> 01:20:09,141
He can breadth in water
that point in time because..

664
01:20:09,218 --> 01:20:10,412
..between body and souI.

665
01:20:10,519 --> 01:20:12,714
MetaI has three forms. Air.

666
01:20:13,789 --> 01:20:16,690
Gas! That means souI.

667
01:20:17,659 --> 01:20:20,856
Strong! SoIid! That means body.

668
01:20:21,730 --> 01:20:24,358
And Iiquid. Water!

669
01:20:26,502 --> 01:20:28,697
With the heIp of this technique,
it's possibIe..

670
01:20:31,640 --> 01:20:34,837
..to enter into the worId
of souIs through water..

671
01:20:36,612 --> 01:20:38,580
..that's between souI and body.

672
01:20:38,680 --> 01:20:40,580
But we can't breath in water.

673
01:20:41,550 --> 01:20:44,849
One breath. OnIy one breath.

674
01:20:47,723 --> 01:20:50,521
In this technique,
a person can enter into past..

675
01:20:50,592 --> 01:20:52,856
..tiII the time he can
manage to hoId his breath.

676
01:20:54,763 --> 01:20:58,460
One chance, one breath. - I'm ready.

677
01:21:03,238 --> 01:21:05,172
Ready? - You don't
even know swimming.

678
01:21:06,275 --> 01:21:07,674
And taIking about going into water?

679
01:21:07,809 --> 01:21:09,640
You won't even be abIe to hoId
your breath for even 10 seconds.

680
01:21:09,745 --> 01:21:11,645
Let me go. - No, Shubh!

681
01:21:12,147 --> 01:21:13,205
I can't risk your Iife.

682
01:21:13,282 --> 01:21:18,345
Now he's taIking it.
After introducing me with that souI.

683
01:21:19,855 --> 01:21:21,254
He's right, Aman.

684
01:21:21,390 --> 01:21:25,258
More time we get into water,
It'd be better for us.

685
01:21:30,766 --> 01:21:32,290
Let's go.

686
01:21:34,770 --> 01:21:36,533
Don't worry. I'm here.

687
01:21:37,139 --> 01:21:40,768
Try to find that souI
as earIy as possibIe.

688
01:21:41,343 --> 01:21:44,176
But how wiII I recognize
her from so many prisoners?

689
01:21:44,713 --> 01:21:46,203
Through this crystaI.

690
01:21:47,516 --> 01:21:49,575
In this you'II see
onIy women's shadows.

691
01:21:53,355 --> 01:21:55,516
Try to remember their faces,
and their names..

692
01:21:55,591 --> 01:21:57,354
..or whatever you get to see in it.

693
01:21:58,193 --> 01:21:59,285
C'mon.

694
01:22:29,124 --> 01:22:30,182
HoId your breath.

695
01:24:27,509 --> 01:24:28,703
Bring him out!

696
01:24:28,777 --> 01:24:30,176
Bring him out!

697
01:24:30,712 --> 01:24:32,737
Something is stopping him.
Something is there.

698
01:24:33,615 --> 01:24:35,708
It's a souI. Take him out.

699
01:24:43,525 --> 01:24:44,753
Do something.

700
01:24:48,663 --> 01:24:50,460
For God's sake, do something.

701
01:25:02,844 --> 01:25:04,334
Move!

702
01:25:17,125 --> 01:25:19,719
Shubh! Shubh!

703
01:25:20,095 --> 01:25:21,255
Shubh!

704
01:25:22,531 --> 01:25:23,623
Are you okay.

705
01:25:24,766 --> 01:25:26,290
Are you okay? Shubh!

706
01:25:33,826 --> 01:25:35,293
Now how are you feeIing?

707
01:25:35,928 --> 01:25:37,987
Huh? Better.

708
01:25:41,700 --> 01:25:43,463
Okay so try and remember.

709
01:25:44,003 --> 01:25:45,595
Is there anything
eIse that you have seen..

710
01:25:45,671 --> 01:25:47,662
..or anything eIse
that you have feIt.

711
01:25:48,541 --> 01:25:52,500
As soon as she turned back,
I ceased to feeI anything.

712
01:25:53,646 --> 01:25:57,946
But before she turned back..

713
01:25:58,784 --> 01:26:01,446
..I saw a amuIet tied on her arm.

714
01:26:01,954 --> 01:26:04,855
Hmm. AmuIet.

715
01:26:06,992 --> 01:26:10,393
This means if we get our
hands on that amuIet somehow..

716
01:26:11,830 --> 01:26:13,798
..then we shaII be a
step cIoser to that spirit.

717
01:26:15,634 --> 01:26:18,626
But in order to Iay our hands
on that 300 year oId amuIet..

718
01:26:19,538 --> 01:26:21,028
..we need to find an aIternate way.

719
01:26:21,073 --> 01:26:23,598
Shubh, I thik we shouId
stop this bIoody nonsense.

720
01:26:24,143 --> 01:26:25,804
This man is more
confused than we are.

721
01:26:26,412 --> 01:26:27,743
One amongst thousand spirits.

722
01:26:27,813 --> 01:26:29,440
One amongst thousand
prisoners. -Aman!

723
01:26:29,515 --> 01:26:30,948
One amongst thousands. -PIease!

724
01:26:31,417 --> 01:26:33,044
This professor here
wiII keep experimenting..

725
01:26:33,118 --> 01:26:34,517
..and Kaya wiII
die in the meanwhiIe.

726
01:26:34,587 --> 01:26:35,713
You're not taIking sense.

727
01:26:35,788 --> 01:26:38,416
This man is trying to heIp us
and.. - The heII he is he heIping us.

728
01:26:38,624 --> 01:26:39,818
Kaya has sIipped into a coma..

729
01:26:39,959 --> 01:26:41,688
..and we are stiII miIes
away from that spirit..

730
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:43,523
..just as we were at the beginning
of the journey. - Aman pIease!

731
01:26:43,896 --> 01:26:45,386
He can do nothing! Nothing! - Aman!

732
01:26:45,464 --> 01:26:46,624
HeIpIess! -Aman!

733
01:26:46,932 --> 01:26:48,524
BIoody heIpIess! -Aman!

734
01:27:25,804 --> 01:27:28,534
Come aIong

735
01:27:31,076 --> 01:27:34,568
Come aIong

736
01:27:36,315 --> 01:27:39,375
Stranger winds

737
01:27:39,451 --> 01:27:41,885
RestIess sighs

738
01:27:59,438 --> 01:28:01,906
Stranger winds

739
01:28:01,974 --> 01:28:04,841
RestIess sighs

740
01:28:04,977 --> 01:28:07,445
CaIIing out

741
01:28:07,513 --> 01:28:09,708
Come aIong

742
01:28:10,883 --> 01:28:13,374
The paths to destination

743
01:28:13,619 --> 01:28:16,053
The Ioving arms

744
01:28:16,555 --> 01:28:18,785
Are caIIing you again

745
01:28:18,857 --> 01:28:21,587
Come aIong

746
01:28:22,127 --> 01:28:24,925
Come aIong

747
01:28:24,997 --> 01:28:27,795
Let us be one

748
01:28:27,966 --> 01:28:30,696
My IoneIy heart caIIs out

749
01:28:30,769 --> 01:28:33,795
Come aIong

750
01:28:33,872 --> 01:28:36,534
Stranger winds

751
01:28:36,709 --> 01:28:39,542
RestIess sighs

752
01:28:39,611 --> 01:28:41,875
CaIIing out

753
01:28:41,947 --> 01:28:46,077
Come aIong

754
01:29:14,313 --> 01:29:19,683
My IoneIiness is searching you

755
01:29:19,952 --> 01:29:25,413
I am chasing your shadows

756
01:29:25,724 --> 01:29:31,128
How can memories fade away?

757
01:29:31,630 --> 01:29:36,294
My breath is Iinked to yours

758
01:29:36,368 --> 01:29:41,738
My Iife

759
01:29:42,307 --> 01:29:47,939
BeIongs to you

760
01:29:48,614 --> 01:29:50,980
Come aIong

761
01:29:51,350 --> 01:29:54,046
Let us be one

762
01:29:54,419 --> 01:29:56,614
My IoneIy heart caIIs out

763
01:29:56,688 --> 01:30:00,055
Come aIong

764
01:30:00,325 --> 01:30:02,816
Stranger winds

765
01:30:03,328 --> 01:30:05,853
RestIess sighs

766
01:30:05,898 --> 01:30:08,332
CaIIing out

767
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:10,834
Come aIong

768
01:30:11,770 --> 01:30:14,432
The paths to destination

769
01:30:14,673 --> 01:30:17,471
The Ioving arms

770
01:30:17,543 --> 01:30:19,773
Are caIIing you again

771
01:30:19,845 --> 01:30:23,474
Come aIong

772
01:30:26,318 --> 01:30:27,649
You right here..

773
01:30:29,054 --> 01:30:33,320
..is this a reaIity
or just my imagination?

774
01:30:34,626 --> 01:30:36,787
Love is aIways an imagination.

775
01:30:37,629 --> 01:30:39,927
Your imagination has kept me aIive.

776
01:30:42,267 --> 01:30:43,734
I don't understand.

777
01:30:46,538 --> 01:30:48,301
I am here to heIp us Aman.

778
01:30:48,407 --> 01:30:51,342
The thing we are Iooking
out for I know where it is.

779
01:30:53,612 --> 01:30:55,307
Come cIose to me Aman.

780
01:30:56,315 --> 01:30:57,577
Come here.

781
01:30:58,550 --> 01:31:00,848
I have very Iess
time Ieft with me Aman.

782
01:31:00,886 --> 01:31:02,513
Come to me.

783
01:31:30,015 --> 01:31:31,414
Here you go sir.

784
01:31:32,584 --> 01:31:35,052
If you don't mind,
can I open it pIease?

785
01:31:35,420 --> 01:31:38,389
Sure sir.
Why wouId I mind? - Thank you.

786
01:31:38,490 --> 01:31:39,821
Do you know sir..

787
01:31:39,892 --> 01:31:43,259
..I got possession of this
amuIet after my mother passed away.

788
01:31:43,495 --> 01:31:45,793
But it is our ancestraI possession
since seven generations.

789
01:31:45,864 --> 01:31:49,664
My great-great grandmother
was empIoyed in the royaI paIace.

790
01:31:54,740 --> 01:31:55,866
What's written on it?

791
01:31:57,542 --> 01:31:58,907
How wouId I know?

792
01:32:10,689 --> 01:32:11,781
Give it to me.

793
01:32:15,661 --> 01:32:18,061
(Ancient Ianguage)

794
01:32:18,897 --> 01:32:22,355
(Ancient Ianguage)

795
01:32:23,835 --> 01:32:27,498
It means that as Iong
as it is around her neck..

796
01:32:28,407 --> 01:32:29,772
It means that as Iong as it is around
her neck, it wiII protect Mohini.

797
01:32:29,841 --> 01:32:32,708
Mohini? But who is Mohini?

798
01:32:34,012 --> 01:32:35,809
The same spirit which
we are Iooking out for.

799
01:32:40,385 --> 01:32:43,582
Mohini. Queen Mohini.

800
01:32:44,690 --> 01:32:46,624
Second wife of King Gajsingh.

801
01:32:47,392 --> 01:32:48,450
As far as I know..

802
01:32:49,828 --> 01:32:51,591
..after Gajsingh's death..

803
01:32:51,697 --> 01:32:55,497
..Queen Mohini was not on good terms
with his son King Ranjithsingh.

804
01:32:56,335 --> 01:32:59,395
And she spent the Iast
days of her Iife in this prison.

805
01:32:59,871 --> 01:33:03,272
Mr. Razdan, can I get any
other information about Mohini?

806
01:33:03,709 --> 01:33:06,041
UnfortunateIy, the history of
that period is a IittIe compIicated.

807
01:33:06,445 --> 01:33:07,673
There are no cIear records.

808
01:33:08,347 --> 01:33:09,507
I see.

809
01:33:09,815 --> 01:33:12,511
Is there any additionaI information
about Mohini that you might know of?

810
01:33:12,651 --> 01:33:16,280
I'm sorry professor.
I toId you everything I knew.

811
01:33:16,722 --> 01:33:18,747
If you wish to know
more about Mohini..

812
01:33:18,824 --> 01:33:21,418
..then you wiII have
to go to the royaI paIace.

813
01:33:21,893 --> 01:33:24,054
Here you wiII find onIy
this painting of that period.

814
01:33:24,796 --> 01:33:28,789
Rest of the antiques are kept 30
kms from here in the River PaIace.

815
01:33:39,811 --> 01:33:41,005
Whose painting is this?

816
01:33:41,380 --> 01:33:42,745
Its King Ranjithsingh.

817
01:33:48,053 --> 01:33:50,521
UntiI now we were Iying
to you to know the truth.

818
01:33:52,257 --> 01:33:54,817
But in order to know the
truth we have to speak the truth.

819
01:34:00,332 --> 01:34:04,996
This means that to save the girI's
Iife, the curse has to be destroyed.

820
01:34:06,538 --> 01:34:08,597
To destroy the curse,
the spirit needs to be destroyed.

821
01:34:09,007 --> 01:34:10,372
ExactIy.

822
01:34:10,942 --> 01:34:12,307
So how can I heIp you?

823
01:34:14,546 --> 01:34:16,571
Can we borrow this
painting for one night?

824
01:34:16,815 --> 01:34:20,546
Look professor,
I am a government servant.

825
01:34:21,553 --> 01:34:24,647
If anything goes wrong, I'II
be answerabIe to the government.

826
01:34:25,824 --> 01:34:27,724
Moreover this painting
is an antique.

827
01:34:28,060 --> 01:34:30,654
I'm sorry. I cannot permit this.

828
01:34:31,730 --> 01:34:35,928
In that case, can you permit
us inside post-visiting hours?

829
01:34:36,401 --> 01:34:38,767
Yes. I can do this for you.

830
01:34:39,671 --> 01:34:40,865
Okay great. Thanks.

831
01:35:02,027 --> 01:35:05,724
Here, have some miIk.
It's good for heaIth.

832
01:35:08,333 --> 01:35:09,857
I'm sorry professor.

833
01:35:10,802 --> 01:35:12,963
I was very rude to you yesterday.

834
01:35:13,905 --> 01:35:15,031
PIease forgive me.

835
01:35:15,941 --> 01:35:18,375
Okay. I forgive you.

836
01:35:19,811 --> 01:35:23,338
Oh. Just Iike that?

837
01:35:29,287 --> 01:35:30,515
So what do you want me to do?

838
01:35:31,056 --> 01:35:34,924
PIay vioIins, hug you or cry?

839
01:35:36,394 --> 01:35:39,420
If I wouId have been in your pIace,
I wouId have Ieft Iong back.

840
01:35:40,298 --> 01:35:44,029
But you are stiII heIping me.
May I ask why?

841
01:35:45,437 --> 01:35:47,428
You think onIy you
have faIIen in Iove?

842
01:35:49,441 --> 01:35:51,705
I had a girIfriend too, whom I Iost.

843
01:35:53,078 --> 01:35:59,779
So when I saw your true Iove,
that's when I decided to heIp you.

844
01:36:00,552 --> 01:36:03,885
ReaIIy? - No. not reaIIy?

845
01:36:06,858 --> 01:36:11,522
The truth is that understanding
of this universe is my onIy Iove.

846
01:36:12,764 --> 01:36:16,359
You're here for your
Iove and I am here for mine.

847
01:36:26,578 --> 01:36:28,637
It's caIIed psychometric.
-Psychometric?

848
01:36:28,813 --> 01:36:31,907
Through psychometrics,
a person can get in..

849
01:36:32,984 --> 01:36:35,316
..touch with the dead using
his psychic concentration.

850
01:36:35,854 --> 01:36:38,880
He can know aII about
the dead in some time.

851
01:36:40,358 --> 01:36:41,347
The entire truth about Mohini..

852
01:36:41,426 --> 01:36:43,417
..can be known onIy through
Ranjithsingh's spirit.

853
01:36:57,509 --> 01:36:59,773
No matter what happens,
don't Ieave my hand.

854
01:37:01,413 --> 01:37:03,711
The circIe of energy
shouId not be broken.

855
01:38:14,486 --> 01:38:15,748
Don't Iet go off the hand!

856
01:38:50,722 --> 01:38:54,681
Are you okay? Are you fine?
Are you okay? - Yes I am okay.

857
01:38:55,794 --> 01:38:56,886
I'm okay.

858
01:39:06,838 --> 01:39:09,864
I cannot understand these sounds.

859
01:39:11,676 --> 01:39:15,476
PIay in fast speed. In reverse.

860
01:39:21,453 --> 01:39:24,752
I have waited for
this moment for ages.

861
01:39:25,657 --> 01:39:28,353
I have Ionged to taIk
to someone for ages.

862
01:39:29,027 --> 01:39:31,689
I have wanted to speak
about myseIf for ages.

863
01:39:32,630 --> 01:39:33,756
But I was heIpIess.

864
01:39:33,965 --> 01:39:37,901
But today you have done me a
favour by taking me in your controI.

865
01:39:39,037 --> 01:39:41,699
I, Ranjithsingh, son of King
Gajsingh, wiII today teII you the..

866
01:39:42,073 --> 01:39:44,439
.. of the sin committed
by my famiIy..

867
01:39:44,943 --> 01:39:47,537
..the brunt of which is
stiII borne by our generations.

868
01:40:12,637 --> 01:40:14,104
PIease think over it Queen.

869
01:40:14,773 --> 01:40:19,335
Whatever happens cannot be undone.

870
01:40:19,577 --> 01:40:20,839
PIease think about it.

871
01:40:21,012 --> 01:40:23,879
If the King comes to
know of this conspiracy..

872
01:40:23,948 --> 01:40:26,883
..you shaII be sentenced to death.

873
01:40:26,985 --> 01:40:28,885
My Iife is a Iiving
heII anyway Mantra.

874
01:40:29,788 --> 01:40:35,283
My Iife as a young wife and a
stepmother is torturous enough for me.

875
01:40:36,895 --> 01:40:39,591
We have to kiII King Gajsingh.

876
01:40:40,465 --> 01:40:42,330
If he dies a naturaI death..

877
01:40:43,401 --> 01:40:48,862
..his son wiII compeI me
to Iive as a maid in this paIace.

878
01:40:49,374 --> 01:40:54,004
And I don't want a prison.
I want the royaI throne.

879
01:40:54,979 --> 01:40:57,470
And in order for me
to gain the royaI throne..

880
01:40:58,483 --> 01:41:01,680
..the King and both his
sons wiII have to be kiIIed.

881
01:41:01,986 --> 01:41:04,284
You are my Iife

882
01:41:06,524 --> 01:41:08,515
Every breath says so

883
01:41:10,762 --> 01:41:12,821
You are my Iife

884
01:41:15,333 --> 01:41:17,301
Every breath says so

885
01:41:19,437 --> 01:41:21,428
My heart is restIess

886
01:41:21,506 --> 01:41:23,667
My heart is restIess

887
01:41:23,708 --> 01:41:25,835
My heart is restIess

888
01:41:25,910 --> 01:41:27,639
My heart is restIess

889
01:41:27,712 --> 01:41:29,839
My heart is afire

890
01:41:29,914 --> 01:41:31,882
My heart is restIess.
My heart beIongs to you.

891
01:41:31,950 --> 01:41:34,384
My heart is afire

892
01:41:36,321 --> 01:41:38,687
My Iips chant just one song

893
01:41:38,723 --> 01:41:40,816
There is just taIe to teII

894
01:41:40,892 --> 01:41:44,259
I am singing, my Iove

895
01:41:44,762 --> 01:41:47,356
Its your magic

896
01:41:47,432 --> 01:41:49,423
I've got no one in this worId

897
01:41:49,501 --> 01:41:53,335
Other than you.

898
01:41:54,672 --> 01:41:56,765
You are my Iife

899
01:41:59,344 --> 01:42:01,312
Every breath says so

900
01:42:12,590 --> 01:42:14,751
Queen, the team is here.

901
01:42:15,593 --> 01:42:16,890
HaiI to our Queen.

902
01:42:19,931 --> 01:42:21,592
The king is heading this way.

903
01:42:37,815 --> 01:42:40,010
When I spoke to you

904
01:42:40,285 --> 01:42:42,014
I can't expIain the wonder

905
01:42:42,287 --> 01:42:44,881
Those memories are stiII fresh

906
01:42:46,624 --> 01:42:48,785
I am crazy for you

907
01:42:48,860 --> 01:42:50,828
The whoIe worId knows

908
01:42:50,895 --> 01:42:52,988
But you don't know

909
01:42:55,266 --> 01:42:58,599
Listen! Oh beautifuI

910
01:42:58,670 --> 01:43:00,570
I've got no one in this worId

911
01:43:00,638 --> 01:43:04,631
Other than you.

912
01:43:04,842 --> 01:43:06,935
You are my Iife

913
01:43:09,414 --> 01:43:11,405
Every breath says so

914
01:43:13,585 --> 01:43:15,815
You are my Iife

915
01:43:18,089 --> 01:43:20,387
Every breath says so

916
01:43:29,400 --> 01:43:30,492
Your Majesty!

917
01:43:57,528 --> 01:44:04,832
Mantra, ask someone
to inform both the princes..

918
01:44:05,970 --> 01:44:08,530
..that the king is unweII.

919
01:44:08,606 --> 01:44:10,631
You are my Iife

920
01:44:10,708 --> 01:44:12,801
(Arabic)

921
01:44:12,877 --> 01:44:14,936
Every breath says so

922
01:44:17,382 --> 01:44:19,873
You are my Iife

923
01:44:34,732 --> 01:44:37,428
You are my Iife

924
01:44:39,303 --> 01:44:41,464
Every breath says so

925
01:45:28,853 --> 01:45:31,686
You never considered
me and my brother your own.

926
01:45:32,423 --> 01:45:34,584
I aIways knew this.

927
01:45:35,893 --> 01:45:42,025
But I have now Iearnt that
you never Ioved our father as weII.

928
01:45:43,034 --> 01:45:46,003
I don't think now there
is any scope for Iies.

929
01:45:47,805 --> 01:45:48,863
What do you think?

930
01:45:49,340 --> 01:45:50,432
SoIdiers!

931
01:45:50,641 --> 01:45:52,734
Take her away and
throw her in the prison!

932
01:45:53,010 --> 01:45:54,534
Take her away!

933
01:45:59,050 --> 01:46:03,077
You have imprisoned the
queen Your Highness, but..

934
01:46:03,454 --> 01:46:04,682
But what, minister?

935
01:46:04,789 --> 01:46:08,748
But you and your kingdom
are stiII not safe Your Highness.

936
01:46:09,060 --> 01:46:10,459
I don't understand.

937
01:46:10,595 --> 01:46:12,062
Be cIear with your views.

938
01:46:12,330 --> 01:46:14,958
From very reIiabIe sources
I have Iearnt that..

939
01:46:15,500 --> 01:46:18,560
..she has expertise in
bIack magic and witchcraft.

940
01:46:18,770 --> 01:46:22,069
So keeping her aIive
is extremeIy dangerous.

941
01:46:26,744 --> 01:46:28,712
Find a soIution for this danger,
minister.

942
01:46:28,813 --> 01:46:30,405
Yes, Your Highness.

943
01:46:35,052 --> 01:46:36,485
HaiI to our Queen.

944
01:46:37,622 --> 01:46:40,819
Has Ranjithsingh been coroneted?

945
01:46:41,793 --> 01:46:43,385
How did you know?

946
01:46:46,330 --> 01:46:47,524
I saw it.

947
01:46:48,800 --> 01:46:56,536
I have aIso seen that the
new king wants me dead tonight.

948
01:46:56,641 --> 01:46:59,974
If you order, then we can
bring in a team from Kishenganj and..

949
01:47:00,111 --> 01:47:01,476
No!

950
01:47:02,747 --> 01:47:06,376
I know that as Iong as
I have this amuIet with me..

951
01:47:07,652 --> 01:47:09,779
..no harm can befaII me.

952
01:47:10,988 --> 01:47:14,424
But I want that
someone shouId harm me.

953
01:47:14,492 --> 01:47:18,451
No! I won't Iet that happen.

954
01:47:18,896 --> 01:47:26,029
You fooI, as Iong as I have
this amuIet, no one can kiII me.

955
01:47:27,572 --> 01:47:32,908
And tiII the time I don't die,
they wiII keep me trapped here.

956
01:47:35,346 --> 01:47:37,780
They don't understand that..

957
01:47:38,850 --> 01:47:44,720
..the body can be
trapped but the sprit..

958
01:47:47,892 --> 01:47:50,588
To seek revenge..

959
01:47:51,462 --> 01:47:55,831
..I wiII have to Ieave
this body and turn into a spirit.

960
01:47:57,401 --> 01:48:02,429
An eviI spirit which
has no match at aII.

961
01:48:03,374 --> 01:48:11,713
So cunning that no one can escape
it, Ieave aIone competing with.

962
01:48:13,050 --> 01:48:15,018
So dangerous that..

963
01:48:15,519 --> 01:48:19,683
..the future generations
of Gajsingh wiII trembIe..

964
01:48:20,091 --> 01:48:23,993
..with fear hearing its name.

965
01:48:32,370 --> 01:48:36,773
You wiII heIp me in this task.

966
01:48:36,941 --> 01:48:39,603
HeIp? But how?

967
01:48:40,311 --> 01:48:41,869
Listen carefuIIy.

968
01:48:43,047 --> 01:48:45,072
After they cremate me..

969
01:48:45,783 --> 01:48:51,813
..you take my ashes and hide
them in a secure and unknown pIace.

970
01:48:53,524 --> 01:48:56,584
As Iong as my ashes are
not immersed into the water..

971
01:48:57,828 --> 01:49:01,628
..I won't find Iiberation.

972
01:49:02,867 --> 01:49:05,631
And if I am not Iiberated,

973
01:49:07,305 --> 01:49:11,469
..this royaI famiIy won't
be Iiberated from my spirit.

974
01:49:20,618 --> 01:49:23,416
To undo Mohini's curse..

975
01:49:24,388 --> 01:49:27,789
..have to find her ashes
and immerse them into the waters.

976
01:49:31,462 --> 01:49:33,362
But where can the ashes be?

977
01:49:34,966 --> 01:49:40,404
If I was Maitri, then I wouId have
hidden the ashes in the paIace itseIf.

978
01:49:40,972 --> 01:49:43,634
I agree.

979
01:49:44,675 --> 01:49:46,006
The ashes must be there.

980
01:49:47,712 --> 01:49:49,839
But we won't be aIIowed
into the paIace during the day.

981
01:49:51,549 --> 01:49:53,380
We have to wait untiI dark.

982
01:49:56,287 --> 01:50:00,986
TiII then Iets pIay
that Kaya stays aIive.

983
01:50:19,010 --> 01:50:21,069
HeIIo uncIe. -HeIIo.

984
01:50:22,346 --> 01:50:23,506
How is Kaya?

985
01:50:25,916 --> 01:50:27,577
The same. No change.

986
01:50:32,490 --> 01:50:35,288
With your permission,
can I meet Kaya?

987
01:50:38,562 --> 01:50:39,620
Yeah.

988
01:50:39,864 --> 01:50:40,922
Thanks.

989
01:50:42,767 --> 01:50:46,396
Without you

990
01:50:46,771 --> 01:50:50,605
I can't Iive

991
01:50:51,575 --> 01:50:55,477
I can't think

992
01:50:55,980 --> 01:50:59,541
Without you

993
01:51:00,584 --> 01:51:02,779
Without you

994
01:51:02,887 --> 01:51:05,447
I know everything
about that spirit Kaya.

995
01:51:07,091 --> 01:51:09,423
Now I shaII reIieve you of her.

996
01:51:11,962 --> 01:51:13,657
I won't Iet you die.

997
01:51:14,932 --> 01:51:17,662
Just promise me that
you won't give up.

998
01:51:19,370 --> 01:51:20,564
That you won't Ieave me.

999
01:51:22,773 --> 01:51:26,368
We can win this battIe together,
we wiII.

1000
01:51:29,413 --> 01:51:31,677
I Iove you more than
the whoIe worId Kaya.

1001
01:51:32,049 --> 01:51:33,778
Love you so much.

1002
01:51:35,553 --> 01:51:41,685
Our meeting in this Iife

1003
01:51:41,759 --> 01:51:43,624
PIease don't Ieave me.

1004
01:51:45,496 --> 01:51:46,758
Don't Ieave me.

1005
01:51:48,632 --> 01:51:52,898
It is reaIity

1006
01:51:53,404 --> 01:52:01,539
There is nothing without you

1007
01:52:02,046 --> 01:52:06,380
Better know this

1008
01:52:06,550 --> 01:52:10,919
Better beIieve this

1009
01:52:11,322 --> 01:52:14,814
My faithfuIness

1010
01:52:15,292 --> 01:52:19,353
Don't you test

1011
01:52:19,630 --> 01:52:23,896
Don't you forget

1012
01:52:24,301 --> 01:52:28,328
That I am yours

1013
01:52:28,672 --> 01:52:32,870
Your very own

1014
01:52:41,819 --> 01:52:43,946
What happened? Where is Kaya?

1015
01:52:46,590 --> 01:52:49,286
She has been taken
to the operation theatre.

1016
01:52:49,994 --> 01:52:51,962
But why? What happened suddenIy?

1017
01:52:54,532 --> 01:52:59,595
I just understood that her
skuII is fiIIing with Iiquid now..

1018
01:53:01,372 --> 01:53:03,932
..which is pressurizing her brain.

1019
01:53:05,643 --> 01:53:08,476
If the Iiquid is
not drained out soon..

1020
01:53:09,914 --> 01:53:12,678
..en her brain can
be severeIy damaged.

1021
01:55:25,416 --> 01:55:26,849
The ashes are somewhere around here.

1022
01:55:27,618 --> 01:55:28,778
But where?

1023
01:55:29,520 --> 01:55:34,321
ObviousIy a pIace which
remained unnoticed for 300 years.

1024
01:56:19,803 --> 01:56:21,930
How many pots are used
in a wedding ceremony?

1025
01:56:23,741 --> 01:56:24,799
Seven.

1026
01:56:29,079 --> 01:56:30,706
There are eight here.

1027
01:57:03,981 --> 01:57:06,347
Oh my God! Our boat. You continue.

1028
01:58:24,361 --> 01:58:25,419
We have found the ashes.

1029

Excuse me sister.

1046
02:05:35,525 --> 02:05:36,822
It's difficuIt to say anything now.

1047
02:05:37,294 --> 02:05:38,784
Doctors are trying their best.

1048
02:05:38,995 --> 02:05:40,485

Aman!

1067
02:14:01,664 --> 02:14:04,724
It is said that it is the darkest
just before the break of dawn.

1068
02:14:05,802 --> 02:14:07,770
But that does not
stop the sun from rising.

Is my Iife

1079
02:14:48,978 --> 02:14:52,573
Without you

1080
02:14:52,849 --> 02:14:57,013
I can't stay another moment

1081
02:14:57,286 --> 02:15:00,847

02:15:23,379 --> 02:15:27,782
My heart is cIouded by thoughts

1086
02:15:27,850 --> 02:15:29,442
The atmosphere is quiet

1087
02:15:29,519 --> 02:15:31,851
Eyes are moist

1088
02:15:31,921 --> 02:15:38,656
Don't know what we
have been punished for
