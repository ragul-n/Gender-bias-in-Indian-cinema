couldn't feel like a dog or

something that isn't
10 thousand pound.

22
00:03:07,258 --> 00:03:09,066

00:03:14,473 --> 00:03:16,474
Yo, just tight the pinch and
let's get out of here.

26
00:03:16,662 --> 00:03:18,062
The cow seems unhappy.

27
00:03:18,262 --> 00:03:20,222
I should not be unhappy because
I just milked her.

28
00:03:20,884 --> 00:03:23,035
Him. You just milked him.

29
00:03:23,225 --> 00:03:25,249
- This is a him?
- Was it one udder?

30
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,094
- Yeah.
- That's not an udder dude.

31
00:03:27,331 --> 00:03:29,232
I was gonna say it was
actually kind off.. it was big.

32
00:03:29,421 --> 00:03:30,421
I had to use two hands...

33
00:03:30,454 --> 00:03:32,111
Stop. We will never
discuss this again.

No.

81
00:07:25,349 --> 00:07:27,170

It's my first time here.

It's exciting!

87
00:07:38,047 --> 00:07:41,766
You must be the bully of detention.
How dumb can you be?

88
00:07:48,819 --> 00:07:49,982
Did you just slap me?

89
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:52,238
I did. Weird, right?

90
00:07:53,197 --> 00:07:55,769
Now I'm gonna be here every day for
what seems like the rest of my life

91
00:07:55,962 --> 00:07:58,839
and I'm sure that you are too.
So let's make a deal.

92
00:07:59,162 --> 00:08:01,808
Don't sit near me or him.

93
00:08:02,823 --> 00:08:04,428
Then we'll be okay.

94
00:08:09,659 --> 00:08:14,301
Okay. I approved homework
or being under better choices...

95
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,160
- work with it. This will be...
- I need to go to the ladies room.

96
00:08:18,266 --> 00:08:19,910
Okay. And Good Morning.

97

Oh my God!

98
00:08:28,495 --> 00:08:30,663
I got your text and I was like,
"Where are they?"

99
00:08:30,863 --> 00:08:34,019
So this is where you come every
Saturday instead of practice.

100
00:08:34,566 --> 00:08:36,448
- It must suck.
- It does.

101
00:08:36,741 --> 00:08:37,924
Well, then you shouldn't have sent,

102
00:08:37,994 --> 00:08:38,915
Try that picture of me.

103
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:41,380
That's not exactly how it happened,
I mean he is a liar.

104
00:08:41,668 --> 00:08:44,327
- You punched his tooth out.
- They put it back.

105
00:08:44,534 --> 00:08:46,492
Water under the, let's move on.

106
00:08:46,701 --> 00:08:47,835

107
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,009

110
00:08:57,337 --> 00:09:00,388
You can chill for cheer practice
if you want, but I wouldn't.

111
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:43,545
God damn!

112
00:10:01,424 --> 00:10:03,152
Oh my God! What have you done?

113
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:04,372
Kimberly what have
you done with your hair.

114
00:10:04,442 --> 00:10:05,114
You cut off your hair?

115
00:10:05,314 --> 00:10:06,314
Whoa, Look!

116
00:10:07,525 --> 00:10:08,033
The door!

117
00:10:08,443 --> 00:10:09,959
Hey thanks for that in there.

118
00:10:10,506 --> 00:10:12,747
No worries, I hate guys like that.

119
00:10:12,806 --> 00:10:13,632
Yeah.

120
00:10:13,686 --> 00:10:16,208
Oh so, hey, we should
hang out sometime huh?

121
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,923
Not that we had to,
I think tonight we should.

122
00:10:19,417 --> 00:10:20,942
- What's your name again?
- Billy.

123
00:10:21,408 --> 00:10:22,616
Billy Cranston.

124
00:10:22,985 --> 00:10:24,343
Or William Cranston.

125
00:10:24,471 --> 00:10:26,471
Remember Cage use to call me
"Billie Cramp stones".

126
00:10:26,775 --> 00:10:29,298
As a third grade joke like Billy
Cramp stone is a crayon in his butt.

127
00:10:29,496 --> 00:10:33,397
Which I didn't. But it is really impossible
to cram a ton of crayons in your butt.

128
00:10:33,657 --> 00:10:35,953
- No, no, I'm sorry... Okay Billy.
- I would honestly hang out with you

129
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:39,669
but I have a date every night with
the Angel Grove Sherriff's department.

130
00:10:40,334 --> 00:10:40,954
So, I am sorry.

131
00:10:41,024 --> 00:10:42,965
Wait! No, no, no.
Don't leave, don't leave.

132
00:10:43,134 --> 00:10:46,115
Hey. Alright, so, I don't really
expect for us to hang out..

133
00:10:46,295 --> 00:10:47,516
Truth is I need to get
somewhere tonight,

134
00:10:47,586 --> 00:10:48,623
and I could really use your help.

135
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:51,487
Billy I hear you, but as I
told you I have house arrest.

136
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:53,334
There is nothing I can do about,
I am sorry.

137
00:10:53,618 --> 00:10:55,002
I mean, I can fix that.

138
00:10:55,698 --> 00:10:58,198
I know how to trick this in,
I have, I have tools.

139
00:10:58,483 --> 00:11:00,150
I have to be in my
house before seven.

140
00:11:00,468 --> 00:11:03,232
Well, If you come to my house before
seven, then I can fix it for you.

141
00:11:03,419 --> 00:11:05,760
I also have a car,
or access to a car.

142
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,820
And If you decide to help me,
you can have the car for a few hours.

143
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:33,741
<i>Come on, honey. Let's go.</i>

144
00:11:36,978 --> 00:11:38,708
<i>Don't be so hard on him.</i>

145
00:11:38,927 --> 00:11:41,310
<i>How do you think he feels
walking around town?</i>

146
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:48,010
<i>What's the plan huh?
What's he gonna do with his life?</i>

147
00:11:48,551 --> 00:11:50,428
<i>He could have been so much more.</i>

148
00:12:08,631 --> 00:12:10,264
Oh My God, is that Jason Scott?

149
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:19,038
Oh my God! Jason Scott!

150
00:12:19,605 --> 00:12:20,396
Billy?

151
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:21,510
Yeah.

152
00:12:21,725 --> 00:12:23,238
- Billy!
- Yeah!

153
00:12:24,124 --> 00:12:25,245
- It's Six...
- Six Fifty six

154
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:27,523
I know, You got four minutes.
Grab that chair.

155
00:12:27,551 --> 00:12:28,742
What's all this stuff?

156
00:12:28,801 --> 00:12:29,871
<i>These are the things that.</i>

157
00:12:29,941 --> 00:12:31,654
<i>I found at my dad's,
most stuff are his.</i>

158
00:12:32,128 --> 00:12:34,094
- Hey.
<i>- Where's the cage?</i>

159
00:12:34,443 --> 00:12:35,862
Here, Here it is!

160
00:12:36,037 --> 00:12:37,709
- Put your foot in this.
- What is it?

161
00:12:37,885 --> 00:12:40,526
It's a Faraday cage. It just stops
the sounds in there for a lucky.

162
00:12:40,645 --> 00:12:42,965
That's the 3 M warning.
Come on up. If the signal goes out.

163
00:12:43,171 --> 00:12:47,426
My dad's been dead now, seven
years four months and... two days?

164
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:49,487
- Yeah, two days.
- Uh, okay.

165
00:12:49,746 --> 00:12:52,319
It's a long time.
He used to work at the mine.

166
00:12:52,579 --> 00:12:54,459
Billy, I really don't think
that we have time...

167
00:12:54,603 --> 00:12:57,099
- You still live in 44-55 Old Wharf?
- Yes, I do.

168
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,399
- Great house.
- Okay.

169
00:12:59,155 --> 00:13:01,451
About my dad, we used to go
and find objects together.

170
00:13:01,605 --> 00:13:04,045
- Some really, really old.
- I am gonna get in trouble, Billy.

171
00:13:04,306 --> 00:13:06,127
Almost like that show
American Pickers.

172
00:13:06,363 --> 00:13:07,216
Billy, the signal's gonna go off.

173
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:08,446
We should definitely
head on to a TV show

174
00:13:08,447 --> 00:13:09,568
that would've been so crazy.

175
00:13:09,731 --> 00:13:10,660
What are you doing?

176
00:13:11,218 --> 00:13:13,596
Dude, Come on. seriously!
It's gonna go!

177
00:13:13,608 --> 00:13:14,678
Billy, come on!

178
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:16,590
What?

179
00:13:25,926 --> 00:13:26,969
Thank you.

180
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:31,188
Can you stop touching me now?

181
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:38,080
It's so cool you
actually showed up.

182
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,896
Well. You're giving me the van.

183
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,003
Lending you the van, but yeah.

184
00:13:42,461 --> 00:13:43,622
How much further is it?

185
00:13:43,946 --> 00:13:47,105
Just 44 minutes and 52 seconds.

186
00:13:47,982 --> 00:13:50,318
- Okay.
- Thank you for helping me today.

187
00:13:50,513 --> 00:13:52,019
It's okay, Billy.

188
00:13:54,619 --> 00:13:57,068
This is the entrance
to the Gold Mine,

189
00:13:57,138 --> 00:13:59,521
and clearly Billy, the sign says...

190
00:13:59,663 --> 00:14:01,065
Keep driving.

191
00:14:02,968 --> 00:14:03,968
Okay.

192
00:14:05,065 --> 00:14:07,467
Look, if we find something cool,
then you can keep the half.

193
00:14:07,622 --> 00:14:08,791
It's a rule that...

194
00:14:11,266 --> 00:14:12,720
They are gonna blow
this whole thing.

195
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:14,203
It will all be gone in a week now.

196
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,623
Billy, can I be honest?

197
00:14:15,945 --> 00:14:18,932
The deal was I drop you somewhere
I get the van for few hours okay?

198
00:14:19,145 --> 00:14:22,001
This is weird. Like we don't
know each other at all.

199
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:24,301
I don't know what we are doing here,
and you seem...

200
00:14:24,347 --> 00:14:26,233
Wait. I gotta tell you something.

201
00:14:26,372 --> 00:14:27,391
I'm on the spectrum.

202
00:14:28,673 --> 00:14:31,629
Is that like a workout program?
Like, Tae Bo?

203
00:14:32,314 --> 00:14:34,818
No. It's a diagnosis
Excuse me.

204
00:14:35,064 --> 00:14:38,221
I know! It was a joke.
I was kidding.

205
00:14:38,365 --> 00:14:40,174
See that's the thing,
I did not get the joke.

206
00:14:40,766 --> 00:14:43,177
Like my brain doesn't work
the same as yours does.

207
00:14:43,376 --> 00:14:46,097
Yeah, well,
consider that a good thing.

208
00:14:46,298 --> 00:14:49,038
It's just that I can't
read humor or sarcasm.

209
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:51,879
But I do remember things.
I remember everything.

210
00:14:52,135 --> 00:14:53,878
- Billy, let me stop here.
- Okay.

211
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,479
You do not need to
tell me all of this.

212
00:14:56,925 --> 00:14:57,925
We are cool.

213
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:00,925
Ok, we are... We are almost there.

214
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:04,429
Which is good news.
So Take my spare flashlight...

215
00:15:04,558 --> 00:15:06,135
Cause it's gonna be
dark when you get back.

216
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:06,806
Bye, Billy!

217
00:15:09,226 --> 00:15:09,858
Okay!

218
00:15:24,641 --> 00:15:26,285
Ah, she's back again.

219
00:15:28,687 --> 00:15:29,910
The crazy girl.

220
00:15:30,088 --> 00:15:31,931
Just like clockwork.

221
00:15:47,691 --> 00:15:49,101
Who are you?

222
00:16:22,558 --> 00:16:23,990
No way!

223
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:29,740
Hello?

224
00:16:31,933 --> 00:16:33,061
Hey!

225
00:16:35,503 --> 00:16:36,503
Hey!

226
00:16:40,329 --> 00:16:41,353
No, no, no.

227
00:16:41,863 --> 00:16:42,863
Kimberly!

228
00:16:43,987 --> 00:16:45,103
Kimberly!

229
00:16:46,158 --> 00:16:47,335
It's okay. It's okay.

230
00:16:48,894 --> 00:16:50,779
It's strange to
hear you say my name.

231
00:16:50,849 --> 00:16:51,373
What?

232
00:16:51,792 --> 00:16:52,809
What did you say?

233
00:16:53,055 --> 00:16:55,811
I said it's strange to
hear you say my name.

234
00:16:55,995 --> 00:16:57,290
Like we know each other.

235
00:16:57,741 --> 00:16:59,532
We do know each other.

236
00:16:59,667 --> 00:17:03,183
Oh, we know who each other are,
but we don't really know each other.

237
00:17:03,411 --> 00:17:05,183
I know you used to date Ty Fleming.

238
00:17:05,898 --> 00:17:08,054
Then you know I
punched his tooth out.

239
00:17:08,514 --> 00:17:10,225
I know they put it back.

240
00:17:21,403 --> 00:17:24,458
Dad, I hope you're watching
I'm gonna make you proud.

241
00:17:27,118 --> 00:17:30,821
Dad I forgot to tell you I took the
van without asking Mom's permission.

242
00:17:31,813 --> 00:17:33,731
I'm telling you,
so I think that's okay.

243
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,696
Anyways, I gotta focus.

244
00:17:36,111 --> 00:17:38,742
So, what are you doing up here?
Did you follow me?

245
00:17:39,007 --> 00:17:41,447
I came with Billy.

246
00:17:41,763 --> 00:17:43,816
Billy Cranston? Weird.

247
00:17:44,069 --> 00:17:45,836
But I've seen him up here before.

248
00:17:46,424 --> 00:17:48,641
My house is on the other
side of the mountain.

249
00:17:48,823 --> 00:17:51,491
I hike these trails sometimes
to clear my head.

250
00:17:51,766 --> 00:17:55,937
And I stare down at Angel Grove and
wonder how such a small crap town...

251
00:17:56,027 --> 00:17:57,740
can cause me such misery.

252
00:17:58,838 --> 00:18:00,395
That funny to you?

253
00:18:01,379 --> 00:18:03,428
No, I just.. I feel the same way.

254
00:18:03,704 --> 00:18:07,309
Yeah. Jason Scott, the star
quarterback crashes and burns.

255
00:18:07,509 --> 00:18:10,580
Destroys his career and
destroys our season. Go, Tigers!

256
00:18:10,779 --> 00:18:12,157
Now walking around town,

257
00:18:12,227 --> 00:18:15,214
and everyone's looking me
like I ran over their dogs.

258
00:18:16,652 --> 00:18:18,172
So why don't you leave?

259
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:20,092
You know. Just go,

260
00:18:20,252 --> 00:18:21,940
I can leave here, you know?

261
00:18:22,153 --> 00:18:22,984
Where?

262
00:18:23,173 --> 00:18:24,327
God, anywhere.

263
00:18:24,588 --> 00:18:25,766
So let's go.

264
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:28,490
- What?
- You would never do it.

265
00:18:28,655 --> 00:18:30,891
- Try me.
- Oh, You and me? You got a car?

266
00:18:31,221 --> 00:18:33,296
- I have a van.
- Oh, that's creepy.

267
00:18:33,591 --> 00:18:36,600
- It's not that kind of van.
- Every van's that kind of van.

268
00:18:36,812 --> 00:18:37,997
So let's go.

269
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:41,800
Are you daring me? 'cause I'll go.

270
00:18:46,236 --> 00:18:47,292
Good.

271
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,942
Dad, get ready.

272
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,186
That didn't work.

273
00:19:05,094 --> 00:19:07,315
Whoops! Whoa!

274
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:09,604
That really run my bell.

275
00:19:09,796 --> 00:19:10,796
Go, go, go, go!

276
00:19:11,596 --> 00:19:12,775
- Hey, wow!
- Wow!

277
00:19:14,032 --> 00:19:14,895
What are you doing, dude?

278
00:19:14,965 --> 00:19:16,365
I've digging up
here for some years.

279
00:19:16,533 --> 00:19:18,554
Hey! Easy guys. Let's sort this out.

280
00:19:18,903 --> 00:19:20,979
- I had seen him up here before.
- Hey Jason.

281
00:19:21,233 --> 00:19:23,185
You cannot walk
around blow stuffs up.

282
00:19:23,349 --> 00:19:25,093
I was just trying to
dig a little deeper.

283
00:19:25,163 --> 00:19:26,296
Maybe I dug too deep huh.

284
00:19:26,636 --> 00:19:28,951
Billy, you don't have to yell.
We can hear you, okay?

285
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:30,351
- Okay!
- Hey!

286
00:19:31,027 --> 00:19:33,128
You guys looking to get
busted or something?

287
00:19:33,198 --> 00:19:34,810
This place is a restricted area.

288
00:19:35,072 --> 00:19:37,092
Oh Really, Einstein? Restricted?

289
00:19:37,273 --> 00:19:37,995
As in

290
00:19:38,199 --> 00:19:41,644
we shouldn't be standing on a crazy
rock doing some Karate kid moves right.

291
00:19:42,004 --> 00:19:43,744
- Yeah I feel you.
- Guys...

292
00:19:43,994 --> 00:19:47,372
Yeah or camping out on old trench.
I see you too homeboy.

293
00:19:47,576 --> 00:19:48,308
Guys...

294
00:19:48,397 --> 00:19:50,117
There is a lot of mine
security out tonight.

295
00:19:53,557 --> 00:19:54,557
Oh no.

296
00:19:55,535 --> 00:19:56,571
What?

297
00:19:59,548 --> 00:20:00,602
Watch out!

298
00:20:09,238 --> 00:20:10,392
Are you okay?

299
00:20:10,591 --> 00:20:12,329
Yeah, yeah, I'm ok.

300
00:20:15,312 --> 00:20:16,312
Whoa!

301
00:20:21,163 --> 00:20:22,181
What is it?

302
00:20:41,527 --> 00:20:43,671
I have never seen
glass like this before.

303
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:45,125
Oh My God.

304
00:20:48,363 --> 00:20:50,605
Who is it? What is that?

305
00:20:50,972 --> 00:20:52,530
There is something in there.

306
00:20:53,073 --> 00:20:54,073
Hey.

307
00:20:55,373 --> 00:20:56,373
Move!

308
00:20:56,653 --> 00:20:57,674
Watch out. Watch out.

309
00:20:58,004 --> 00:20:59,768
- What are you doing?
- No no no.

310
00:20:59,933 --> 00:21:01,254
- Seriously?
- What are you doing?

311
00:21:01,295 --> 00:21:02,295
Yeah!

312
00:21:05,976 --> 00:21:07,865
My dad always knew the right spots.

313
00:21:08,131 --> 00:21:09,131
There's gotta be more.

314
00:21:09,378 --> 00:21:11,363
Come on. Get out of the way!

315
00:21:13,727 --> 00:21:14,727
What is it?

316
00:21:16,085 --> 00:21:17,085
What's that?

317
00:21:20,299 --> 00:21:22,731
What? No, no, no, no!
Don't break. Don't break!

318
00:21:22,932 --> 00:21:24,471
Don't break it. Don't break!

319
00:21:24,665 --> 00:21:26,319
You broke it. Okay.

320
00:21:29,639 --> 00:21:30,639
Wow, What?

321
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:39,462
Oh My God, what is that?

322
00:21:39,805 --> 00:21:42,610
Yo look, we all found these...

323
00:21:42,785 --> 00:21:45,274
- No, he found them. Chill out.
- Chill out?

324
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,890
Guys, guys, do you hear that?

325
00:21:48,886 --> 00:21:51,207
Mine security. Peace.

326
00:21:51,379 --> 00:21:53,119
Someone should have
pointed that out.

327
00:21:53,189 --> 00:21:53,817
Wait, I did.

328
00:21:54,088 --> 00:21:55,088
Billy!

329
00:21:55,266 --> 00:21:57,187
- Wait! Okay, okay!
- Run! Run!

330
00:21:58,022 --> 00:21:59,810
Billy! Come on, come on!

331
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:03,250
- Billy! Let's go!
- I'm going!

332
00:22:08,877 --> 00:22:10,262
- Jason! Jason!
- You gotta open the door.

333
00:22:10,468 --> 00:22:11,892
Open the door! Open it!

334
00:22:12,143 --> 00:22:14,294
- Yes, okay, get in.
- What are you doing?

335
00:22:14,573 --> 00:22:15,931
Do you see them?
Are they on the road?

336
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:16,662
I don't know.

337
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,880
Okay.

338
00:22:19,235 --> 00:22:21,440
Ok, what about the others?
You gonna leave the others?

339
00:22:21,995 --> 00:22:22,995
Hold on!

340
00:22:24,652 --> 00:22:26,977
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Jason!

341
00:22:27,341 --> 00:22:28,439
What did you do?

342
00:22:34,955 --> 00:22:36,647
My mom's gonna kill me.

343
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:40,125
God! get your seatbelt on.

344
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:42,001
Jason, somebody's gonna die!

345
00:22:47,682 --> 00:22:49,017
- There they are!
- Okay So...

346
00:22:49,195 --> 00:22:51,023
- The Hill.
- Come on!

347
00:22:51,958 --> 00:22:54,099
- Ok, you drive.
- I really don't drive.

348
00:22:54,248 --> 00:22:57,251
- Really don't drive.
- ...So I can pull them in.

349
00:22:57,425 --> 00:22:58,425
I don't do...

350
00:22:59,455 --> 00:23:00,831
Get your foot!

351
00:23:01,356 --> 00:23:04,711
- It says that the door's open.
- Because it's open, Billy!

352
00:23:05,492 --> 00:23:06,624
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

353
00:23:08,363 --> 00:23:09,800
Go, go go!

354
00:23:09,958 --> 00:23:10,759
Good.

355
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:12,744
There they are!

356
00:23:12,945 --> 00:23:13,945
Get in!

357
00:23:15,864 --> 00:23:16,864
Got you.

358
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:18,429
- I Got you.
- I'm in!

359
00:23:21,865 --> 00:23:23,292
What about the other guy?

360
00:23:25,261 --> 00:23:26,856
- Just go!
- Just go!

361
00:23:27,032 --> 00:23:28,092
Billy look out!

362
00:23:32,398 --> 00:23:34,244
Let's go downhill!
Go to the lights pool off!

363
00:23:34,489 --> 00:23:36,316
- You wanna drive man?
- Keep going, we are almost there.

364
00:23:36,513 --> 00:23:37,915
Guys, guy, it's the train!

365
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:39,650
We got it.

366
00:23:45,156 --> 00:23:46,156
Okay.

367
00:23:46,693 --> 00:23:47,966
Oh my, oh my God!

368
00:23:48,203 --> 00:23:49,203
Hey.

369
00:23:49,318 --> 00:23:51,719
- Man, what do you want me to do?
- Keep going. I'll pull him in.

370
00:23:51,869 --> 00:23:52,869
Okay.

371
00:23:55,869 --> 00:23:57,021
Are you crazy?

372
00:23:57,335 --> 00:23:58,633
Yeah, I am.

373
00:24:00,809 --> 00:24:02,171
Just catching up.

374
00:24:04,707 --> 00:24:07,316
Look there is the rail road crossing.
That's the way out, Billy.

375
00:24:12,809 --> 00:24:13,515
You got it.

376
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:14,524
You got it.

377
00:24:14,657 --> 00:24:16,310
- I hope he has it.
- He Definitely doesn’t not have it.

378
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:18,081
I got it, I got it.

379
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:51,745
The storm's turned. It's going bad.
We're getting out of here.

380
00:24:56,885 --> 00:24:58,398
Let's go!

381
00:24:58,586 --> 00:24:59,686
Let's go!

382
00:25:01,386 --> 00:25:02,738
Hold it forward!

383
00:25:03,291 --> 00:25:04,928
Hold. Let's go!

384
00:25:07,269 --> 00:25:08,888
Let's go.

385
00:25:11,058 --> 00:25:12,259
Let it go!

386
00:25:17,497 --> 00:25:18,649
..The hell is that?

387
00:25:19,142 --> 00:25:20,503
Get back!

388
00:25:26,482 --> 00:25:27,563
Everything to port!

389
00:25:27,794 --> 00:25:28,794
Good.

390
00:26:11,676 --> 00:26:12,676
Okay.

391
00:26:14,791 --> 00:26:15,856
Yeah...

392
00:26:19,855 --> 00:26:22,148
<i>Billy, what's happening?</i>

393
00:26:44,462 --> 00:26:45,470
What?

394
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,690
- Where's your bodyguard?
- What are you doing?

395
00:27:24,912 --> 00:27:27,897
I'm just gonna quietly
snap your wrist, you little bitch.

396
00:27:41,567 --> 00:27:42,972
No, no, no...

397
00:27:43,143 --> 00:27:44,143
Okay.

398
00:27:45,496 --> 00:27:49,147
Billy Cranston just knocked
Colt Wallace out cold.

399
00:27:51,724 --> 00:27:52,911
Hi, Billy.

400
00:27:55,624 --> 00:27:57,325
Hey, come on, come on.

401
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:03,300
- Am I crazy or this is crazy?
- It's crazy.

402
00:28:03,585 --> 00:28:06,429
We got hit by a train and we are
standing here. How is that possible?

403
00:28:06,683 --> 00:28:09,003
I don't remember getting home
from the mine at all.

404
00:28:09,178 --> 00:28:11,340
I slept all day Yesterday.

405
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,312
We gotta find Billy.

406
00:28:13,667 --> 00:28:16,388
You know, I wasn't trying to start
any trouble or anything like that.

407
00:28:16,572 --> 00:28:18,507
I said, "Hey man! Look I'm
not a violent person".

408
00:28:18,707 --> 00:28:21,868
But if you must come at me,
come at me, bro.

409
00:28:22,068 --> 00:28:22,852
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

410
00:28:22,955 --> 00:28:26,620
- Boom! Down goes douchbag.
- Down goes... I can't say the word.

411
00:28:26,824 --> 00:28:27,824
Billy.

412
00:28:29,175 --> 00:28:31,269
Hey, Kimberly, Kimberly Hart.

413
00:28:31,601 --> 00:28:32,712
We need to talk.

414
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:35,744
How? How? What?

415
00:28:37,157 --> 00:28:38,918
Since when does he
knows Kimberly Hart?

416
00:28:38,988 --> 00:28:40,008
Billy is awesome.

417
00:28:41,505 --> 00:28:42,701
Nice hair.

418
00:28:45,568 --> 00:28:46,838
Billy. Look at me,

419
00:28:47,633 --> 00:28:48,999
Do you feel weird?

420
00:28:49,397 --> 00:28:50,955
You mean like weird than usual?

421
00:28:51,164 --> 00:28:52,822
Yeah. Different.

422
00:28:57,064 --> 00:28:58,064
Listen.

423
00:28:58,859 --> 00:29:00,593
We know something
happened out there, okay?

424
00:29:00,663 --> 00:29:01,406
I'm not the same.

425
00:29:01,601 --> 00:29:03,072
Me neither. I'm strong!

426
00:29:03,299 --> 00:29:05,618
- How strong?
- Like insanely strong.

427
00:29:06,692 --> 00:29:08,693
I feel like we need
to go back out there.

428
00:29:13,694 --> 00:29:15,375
The counter is boiling.

429
00:29:28,583 --> 00:29:30,021
I'm going back today.

430
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:32,992
Ah. She down here.

431
00:29:33,508 --> 00:29:34,683
Sure it's a woman?

432
00:29:35,606 --> 00:29:38,626
Not a great-looking woman.
Come see for yourself.

433
00:29:40,006 --> 00:29:41,417
Oh the smell is...

434
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:42,660
It's intense.

435
00:29:42,829 --> 00:29:44,256
You should make a note of that.

436
00:29:44,356 --> 00:29:47,362
Smell inside of a north fishing boat
that hold tons of dead fish...

437
00:29:47,608 --> 00:29:50,151
Don't smell so good. Freaky, right?

438
00:29:50,621 --> 00:29:52,200
Look, do you need us?

439
00:29:52,443 --> 00:29:54,945
Alright, cause I need to get to bed.
Lock up when you're done.

440
00:29:55,055 --> 00:29:56,549
There's beers in the fridge.

441
00:30:07,827 --> 00:30:08,910
Jesus.

442
00:30:19,329 --> 00:30:20,329
Jesus.

443
00:30:25,506 --> 00:30:28,831
Unit two, this is Meinen.
I have a body here. Deceased female.

444
00:30:40,299 --> 00:30:41,597
Let's just keep going.

445
00:30:45,446 --> 00:30:47,695
Guys, look. It's that guy again.

446
00:30:48,005 --> 00:30:49,957
Find anything interesting?

447
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:52,570
If I do, I'm keeping it.

448
00:30:52,741 --> 00:30:54,231
We know why you're here.

449
00:30:54,492 --> 00:30:55,492
Oh ya?

450
00:30:55,857 --> 00:30:59,918
You guys wake up surprised
to be alive and jump over a house.

451
00:31:00,081 --> 00:31:02,011
Yeah! Kindda. What? no.

452
00:31:02,731 --> 00:31:05,012
We are different, alright.
Everything is different.

453
00:31:05,152 --> 00:31:06,605
You're Zack, right?

454
00:31:07,362 --> 00:31:08,362
Yup.

455
00:31:08,737 --> 00:31:10,133
You still got Angel Grove?

456
00:31:10,532 --> 00:31:11,769
Sometimes.

457
00:31:14,116 --> 00:31:16,366
The other girl was here too
about an hour ago.

458
00:31:16,834 --> 00:31:18,748
Hey, You mean that girl right there?

459
00:31:18,886 --> 00:31:20,499
Hey! Come on down!

460
00:31:21,641 --> 00:31:22,939
We solve together!

461
00:31:26,522 --> 00:31:27,522
Wow!

462
00:31:27,673 --> 00:31:28,793
Oh screw this.

463
00:31:29,498 --> 00:31:31,408
- Okay, lemme.
- He got up there pretty fast.

464
00:31:31,652 --> 00:31:32,652
No no no!

465
00:31:38,498 --> 00:31:39,577
Yo, Keep up.

466
00:31:47,855 --> 00:31:48,855
Stop!

467
00:31:55,442 --> 00:31:56,920
Just, just talk to me.

468
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:01,386
You have a coin. We have a coin.

469
00:32:01,699 --> 00:32:04,179
We should just talk about this.
I mean... We don't know what...

470
00:32:05,565 --> 00:32:07,268
Whoa ho!

471
00:32:07,412 --> 00:32:08,635
What is wrong with you?

472
00:32:11,841 --> 00:32:14,743
You're crazy! But so am I.

473
00:32:15,211 --> 00:32:16,963
- Woah, Zack.
- I got this.

474
00:32:17,159 --> 00:32:18,355
- Wait.
- No, I got this.

475
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:19,766
Woah woah!

476
00:32:30,621 --> 00:32:31,621
Huh!

477
00:32:32,558 --> 00:32:34,412
- I got her!
- Let go of me!

478
00:32:35,102 --> 00:32:36,367
Just jump over.

479
00:32:36,573 --> 00:32:38,242
Let's go. Jump with me.

480
00:32:38,471 --> 00:32:40,302
- No no no. Don't jump. Don't jump.
- Okay.

481
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,787
I'm gonna jump across with her
and then you jump, okay?

482
00:32:42,922 --> 00:32:43,711
Piece of cake.

483
00:32:43,816 --> 00:32:46,273
No no no! Don't! Jason! Hey!

484
00:32:46,463 --> 00:32:48,118
That's not a piece of cake.

485
00:32:58,554 --> 00:33:00,515
- You alright?
- Yah, no problem.

486
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:03,181
You got this, Billy!

487
00:33:03,342 --> 00:33:05,314
- No I don't!
- It's fun.

488
00:33:05,467 --> 00:33:07,318
- It's such a broad jump!
- Cimon.

489
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:08,864
- Billy, chon.
- We all did it.

490
00:33:09,108 --> 00:33:11,131
You'll be fine, I promise.
Just jump.

491
00:33:11,302 --> 00:33:12,303
C’mon, c’mon.

492
00:33:12,418 --> 00:33:15,469
The drop is probably more than 100
feet which means death is imminent.

493
00:33:15,567 --> 00:33:17,668
Okay, so if you die Billy.
What's gonna happens?

494
00:33:17,836 --> 00:33:19,357
Your mom will be alone.
But it's okay,

495
00:33:19,427 --> 00:33:20,824
cause she can find somebody else.

496
00:33:21,018 --> 00:33:22,863
But she couldn't,
cause you love your momma.

497
00:33:23,012 --> 00:33:24,840
- He is scared.
- Come across. He's fine.

498
00:33:24,985 --> 00:33:28,269
Okay. Okay, alright.

499
00:33:28,466 --> 00:33:30,069
Let's do it.

500
00:33:30,219 --> 00:33:31,219
Okay!

501
00:33:40,619 --> 00:33:42,065
Billy, you got this.

502
00:33:43,045 --> 00:33:44,045
Oh shit!

503
00:33:46,255 --> 00:33:47,437
- Are you okay?
- I got it.

504
00:33:47,619 --> 00:33:48,413
Come on. Climb up.

505
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:49,860
- I did it.
- Billy, you got it.

506
00:33:49,941 --> 00:33:52,069
See what we tell you, Billy.
You got it!

507
00:33:52,139 --> 00:33:53,175
Told you, see?

508
00:33:53,576 --> 00:33:54,576
Yes!

509
00:33:54,661 --> 00:33:56,226
Billy idol! Yeah!

510
00:33:57,801 --> 00:33:59,247
- Oh My God.
- Billy!

511
00:34:00,062 --> 00:34:01,062
Billy!

512
00:34:01,972 --> 00:34:03,092
Billy!

513
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,529
Billy!

514
00:34:06,309 --> 00:34:08,270
- We just kill that dude?
- What do we do?

515
00:34:11,868 --> 00:34:14,189
Hey, guys! You have to get off!

516
00:34:14,395 --> 00:34:16,423
There's water!
You've got to see this!

517
00:34:17,441 --> 00:34:18,542
He's fine.

518
00:34:20,073 --> 00:34:22,935
Yo. Alright. I'll see you guys
down there.

519
00:34:23,506 --> 00:34:24,923
Bring that crazy girl.

520
00:34:27,377 --> 00:34:29,422
Come on, you guys. Let's go!

521
00:34:31,421 --> 00:34:32,421
Whoa!

522
00:34:38,959 --> 00:34:39,959
Hey!

523
00:34:40,767 --> 00:34:42,609
Can I get a sip of your water?

524
00:34:43,434 --> 00:34:44,580
I'm dying.

525
00:34:47,222 --> 00:34:50,368
Hey. Just don't finish it.

526
00:34:50,576 --> 00:34:53,144
Thanks. And I'm really sorry.

527
00:34:53,457 --> 00:34:54,524
Sorry for what?

528
00:35:11,525 --> 00:35:13,516
Welcome to the club!

529
00:35:14,424 --> 00:35:15,877
What's up, crazy girl?

530
00:35:16,425 --> 00:35:17,939
We gotta do that again.

531
00:35:24,905 --> 00:35:26,280
Hey, guys. Guys!

532
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:27,624
What?

533
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:29,925
- Check out how we glow.
- Cool.

534
00:35:30,111 --> 00:35:31,820
- Yeah!
- I like this.

535
00:35:32,226 --> 00:35:33,238
I'm blue!

536
00:35:33,912 --> 00:35:35,651
It's not my favorite color,
but it's cool.

537
00:35:36,452 --> 00:35:37,484
I am black!

538
00:35:37,867 --> 00:35:39,427
- What?
- I am.

539
00:35:39,612 --> 00:35:41,577
No, you're not.

540
00:35:51,926 --> 00:35:53,013
Hey, guys.

541
00:35:53,668 --> 00:35:55,833
There's something down there,
follow me.

542
00:37:26,188 --> 00:37:27,683
- Where we are?
- I don’t know.

543
00:37:27,908 --> 00:37:29,352
Jason! I'm sliding.

544
00:37:38,083 --> 00:37:38,819
Hi.

545
00:37:39,033 --> 00:37:40,033
Again?

546
00:37:43,628 --> 00:37:45,251
Well, that is unusual.

547
00:37:50,354 --> 00:37:52,421
It just gets better and better.

548
00:37:53,216 --> 00:37:54,434
Do you feel that?

549
00:37:57,921 --> 00:37:59,254
Something out here.

550
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:01,071
The walls are shaking.

551
00:38:02,024 --> 00:38:03,105
Come on.

552
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,034
That is impossible.

553
00:38:42,391 --> 00:38:45,090
This must have been here for
millions of years.

554
00:38:45,357 --> 00:38:47,834
Look how the rocks
is growing around it.

555
00:38:49,725 --> 00:38:51,214
I do not like this place.

556
00:38:54,238 --> 00:38:55,378
Hey, guys.

557
00:38:58,833 --> 00:38:59,922
Check it out.

558
00:39:09,829 --> 00:39:11,223
- It's okay.
- It's okay.

559
00:39:17,724 --> 00:39:18,724
Okay.

560
00:39:22,841 --> 00:39:24,641
- Holy...
- Shhh!

561
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:28,084
- Think there's aliens in here?
- Just be quiet, Zack.

562
00:39:28,238 --> 00:39:29,816
It's so cold in here.

563
00:39:32,141 --> 00:39:33,539
Jason, is this real?

564
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,204
Like are we really in
a spaceship right now?

565
00:39:36,205 --> 00:39:38,707
I think so. Just breathe. Okay?

566
00:39:38,907 --> 00:39:39,407
It's okay.

567
00:39:39,561 --> 00:39:41,762
Hey! We've all seen enough here.
Right?

568
00:39:41,832 --> 00:39:42,874
We should go now?

569
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:44,755
What? We're gonna be famous.

570
00:39:44,992 --> 00:39:46,761
- What's wrong with you?
- Quiet!

571
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:49,392
There's something here.

572
00:39:54,076 --> 00:39:55,076
Woah!

573
00:39:56,501 --> 00:39:57,501
What is that?

574
00:40:04,629 --> 00:40:05,776
What's going on?

575
00:40:05,997 --> 00:40:07,272
- Stairs!
- Oh my God!

576
00:40:07,391 --> 00:40:08,423
No way out.

577
00:40:09,622 --> 00:40:11,357
That way. Let's go!

578
00:40:11,915 --> 00:40:12,783
I'm going.

579
00:40:12,842 --> 00:40:13,842
Run!

580
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:25,270
C’mon, c’mon.

581
00:40:37,328 --> 00:40:38,743
Didi, I'm coming.

582
00:40:41,563 --> 00:40:42,702
They're real!

583
00:40:43,999 --> 00:40:45,133
Leave her alone!

584
00:40:49,522 --> 00:40:50,732
We will kill you.

585
00:40:50,925 --> 00:40:52,446
Kill me? How?

586
00:40:53,243 --> 00:40:54,343
There's five of us.

587
00:40:54,525 --> 00:40:55,875
Yes, I know.
I've been waiting for you.

588
00:40:55,945 --> 00:40:57,105
Wait, where is the other guy?

589
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:59,198
One, two, three, four...
Ah, there he is.

590
00:41:00,145 --> 00:41:01,744
No no no.

591
00:41:04,929 --> 00:41:06,067
All of you.

592
00:41:06,516 --> 00:41:09,658
In a spaceship buried underground?
How long have you been waiting?

593
00:41:09,919 --> 00:41:11,575
- What's the day? Monday?
- Yeah.

594
00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:13,851
Then, 65 million years.

595
00:41:14,966 --> 00:41:16,925
I've been very lonely.

596
00:41:18,045 --> 00:41:19,917
You all so young looking.

597
00:41:21,021 --> 00:41:23,810
- This has to do with the coins?
- Yes, the coins!

598
00:41:24,065 --> 00:41:27,070
Different colors, different kids.
Different color kids!

599
00:41:27,572 --> 00:41:29,058
No one said you're here!

600
00:41:30,666 --> 00:41:31,666
Turn around.

601
00:41:34,463 --> 00:41:35,487
Go on.

602
00:41:40,197 --> 00:41:41,482
No way.

603
00:41:43,033 --> 00:41:44,382
Proceed.

604
00:41:44,834 --> 00:41:46,614
I think this will work.

605
00:41:46,852 --> 00:41:49,046
One Two Three Four Five.
Different colors.

606
00:41:49,425 --> 00:41:51,764
Guys, focus on getting out of here.

607
00:41:51,836 --> 00:41:54,866
Stay together and when we
see a chance, we run like hell.

608
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:58,348
Okay. And if we don't get a chance?
Then we kill it.

609
00:42:01,326 --> 00:42:04,747
Shouldn't hurt, but let's see.
Please step into the footprints.

610
00:42:04,848 --> 00:42:08,299
- No, we will not.
- Hey, Question. What are you?

611
00:42:08,527 --> 00:42:11,699
I am Alpha 5, persona Android.

612
00:42:11,748 --> 00:42:12,469
What?

613
00:42:12,649 --> 00:42:14,448
- He said he's an Alpha 5...
- Yes, I know.

614
00:42:14,536 --> 00:42:17,538
I'm a talking robot.
You can trust me.

615
00:42:21,449 --> 00:42:22,495
Billy!

616
00:42:34,601 --> 00:42:35,626
What the hell.

617
00:42:40,735 --> 00:42:41,735
Okay.

618
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:51,897
Why they look at each other?
Is a human characteristic?

619
00:42:52,112 --> 00:42:53,112
Fascinating.

620
00:43:11,467 --> 00:43:14,014
It works! This is great!
It's working!

621
00:43:14,246 --> 00:43:16,137
Zordon! Are you there, Zordon?

622
00:43:16,327 --> 00:43:18,872
Alpha! Where we are?

623
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:21,445
Zordon, nice to hear your voice.

624
00:43:21,538 --> 00:43:23,164
I can see you, Alpha...

625
00:43:23,348 --> 00:43:24,692
...but I can't see me.

626
00:43:25,101 --> 00:43:26,853
Where am I?

627
00:43:27,032 --> 00:43:28,767
You're inside the ship.

628
00:43:29,344 --> 00:43:30,832
Okay. Okay.

629
00:43:30,902 --> 00:43:34,138
Sir, I sealed your essence
into the ship's matrix.

630
00:43:36,699 --> 00:43:37,528
C'mon.

631
00:43:37,654 --> 00:43:38,829
Let's go! Move on!

632
00:43:38,924 --> 00:43:40,949
But the ship is on?

633
00:43:40,963 --> 00:43:43,214
The power coins have finally
returned to the ship.

634
00:43:43,554 --> 00:43:44,554
Go, go, go.

635
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:49,654
Where are the coins?

636
00:43:50,003 --> 00:43:52,593
Where are the rangers?

637
00:43:52,753 --> 00:43:54,611
Come forward, please.

638
00:43:55,543 --> 00:43:56,853
Do we have a choice?

639
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:58,092
I do not think so.

640
00:43:58,093 --> 00:44:01,454
They speak a primitive dialect
called English.

641
00:44:01,506 --> 00:44:04,722
You'll find it in the ship's matrix.

642
00:44:05,454 --> 00:44:07,689
Look! It's Zordon!

643
00:44:07,885 --> 00:44:08,885
What?

644
00:44:09,495 --> 00:44:12,012
Zordon,
they don't know who you were.

645
00:44:12,283 --> 00:44:13,674
Come in, come in.

646
00:44:13,905 --> 00:44:16,415
These are them? They are so small.

647
00:44:16,696 --> 00:44:18,208
Funny, I said the same thing.

648
00:44:18,456 --> 00:44:20,796
You mean to tell me that
the fate of the universe,

649
00:44:21,056 --> 00:44:23,441
placed in the hands
of these children?

650
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,558
The universe? That's a big place.

651
00:44:25,834 --> 00:44:29,697
They're teenagers. Somewhere between
infancy and full maturity.

652
00:44:29,897 --> 00:44:31,077
It's hard to explain really.

653
00:44:31,257 --> 00:44:32,643
Show me the coins.

654
00:44:35,308 --> 00:44:37,157
The Morphing Grid is never wrong.

655
00:44:37,442 --> 00:44:40,340
If the power coins have returned
to the ship with these...

656
00:44:40,542 --> 00:44:41,267
Teenagers!

657
00:44:41,532 --> 00:44:43,247
With these teenagers...

658
00:44:43,357 --> 00:44:46,779
then these teenagers
are the Power Rangers.

659
00:44:46,977 --> 00:44:48,058
Power Rangers!

660
00:44:49,857 --> 00:44:50,857
What?

661
00:44:51,043 --> 00:44:52,851
Okay, a quick question.

662
00:44:53,012 --> 00:44:54,757
Hello. Hate to interrupt.

663
00:44:55,041 --> 00:44:57,457
Did I just hear you say
we're Power Rangers?

664
00:44:57,622 --> 00:45:02,194
Yes. Yes. You are the Power Rangers.
Any other questions?

665
00:45:02,433 --> 00:45:04,226
- No. I think I'm good.
- Good.

666
00:45:04,478 --> 00:45:05,478
I have a question.

667
00:45:05,553 --> 00:45:07,110
Hi. How you doing?

668
00:45:08,498 --> 00:45:09,984
My name is Billy. Billy Cranston.

669
00:45:10,297 --> 00:45:12,444
Kids used to called
me Billy Cramps...

670
00:45:12,576 --> 00:45:14,254
Billy! Stop.

671
00:45:14,559 --> 00:45:15,603
Sorry.

672
00:45:16,330 --> 00:45:20,459
The images here in this sphere tell
the history of the Power Rangers.

673
00:45:20,626 --> 00:45:23,913
Looks like the Power Rangers
were a team that protected life?

674
00:45:24,137 --> 00:45:27,619
And life is a bright light.
Or a piece of light?

675
00:45:27,756 --> 00:45:31,493
Yes. Yes, Very good Billy.
It is called the Zeo Crystal.

676
00:45:31,758 --> 00:45:33,208
Oh. I love this part. This is good.

677
00:45:33,445 --> 00:45:35,852
And every planet in the universe
that has life.

678
00:45:36,061 --> 00:45:38,453
Has a piece of the
Crystal buried inside it.

679
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:41,031
65 million years ago,
Zordon's team died...

680
00:45:41,378 --> 00:45:44,161
defending the Crystal here and
what is now Angel Grove.

681
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:46,460
The Coins have chose you five.

682
00:45:46,661 --> 00:45:51,080
Now you must protect the
Zeo Crystal and life on Earth.

683
00:45:51,385 --> 00:45:55,012
Because we are the Power Rangers?

684
00:45:55,261 --> 00:45:56,393
He's smart!

685
00:45:56,582 --> 00:45:58,862
I'm sorry,
is this some kind of a joke?

686
00:45:59,061 --> 00:46:00,874
Like I'm standing here,
with a wet wedgies.

687
00:46:01,014 --> 00:46:03,446
My socks are so squiggling around,

688
00:46:03,699 --> 00:46:05,443
We're talking to a wall.
I mean guys...

689
00:46:05,513 --> 00:46:06,109
Silence!

690
00:46:59,903 --> 00:47:02,183
Sir,
I am detecting elevated heart rate.

691
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,222
They are very scared.

692
00:47:04,527 --> 00:47:05,968
I don't understand.

693
00:47:06,112 --> 00:47:07,739
Why would you show
us that nightmare?

694
00:47:07,809 --> 00:47:08,984
It's not a nightmare.

695
00:47:09,241 --> 00:47:10,845
- It's the future.
- Is that for real?

696
00:47:11,027 --> 00:47:12,812
- Felt like it.
- Who was that woman?

697
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:14,664
Her name is Rita Repulsa.

698
00:47:14,946 --> 00:47:17,136
She will create Goldar,
a huge monster

699
00:47:17,206 --> 00:47:19,751
who will rip the crystal
from the earth...

700
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:22,690
and all life on your
planet will die.

701
00:47:22,861 --> 00:47:27,666
With the Crystal, Rita will have the
power to create and destroy worlds.

702
00:47:27,943 --> 00:47:32,376
So let me guess. You want
us to kill this woman, Rita?

703
00:47:32,482 --> 00:47:35,233
- Aye, aye, Rita.
- She must be stopped.

704
00:47:35,637 --> 00:47:37,813
- When is she coming?
- It's already here.

705
00:47:37,992 --> 00:47:39,915
My best guess is that
we have 11 months.

706
00:47:40,139 --> 00:47:42,871
I am sorry. Days. Eleven days.

707
00:47:43,268 --> 00:47:45,684
If we are the Power Rangers
and this is our ship...

708
00:47:45,904 --> 00:47:48,185
If I walk through that door
right now will it open for me?

709
00:47:48,322 --> 00:47:49,438
Yes of course.

710
00:47:49,542 --> 00:47:50,542
Come on.

711
00:47:50,671 --> 00:47:52,115
Wait, what are you doing?

712
00:47:52,388 --> 00:47:53,868
No, no, no, come back!

713
00:47:54,290 --> 00:47:56,322
- No. please don't.
- Jason!

714
00:47:56,432 --> 00:47:59,374
My ranger team died
defending the Crystal from Rita.

715
00:47:59,969 --> 00:48:01,669
That's why I'm in this wall.

716
00:48:02,504 --> 00:48:03,875
How do you know my name?

717
00:48:04,258 --> 00:48:07,252
Because it's you, Jason Scott.

718
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:11,768
You are the leader.
You're the Red Ranger.

719
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:18,668
Rita was a Ranger too,
and my friend.

720
00:48:19,193 --> 00:48:20,969
But she betrayed us.

721
00:48:21,287 --> 00:48:22,998
Wanted more power.

722
00:48:23,583 --> 00:48:25,170
She lost her way.

723
00:48:25,502 --> 00:48:28,752
Now she is just pure evil.

724
00:48:29,290 --> 00:48:32,209
You must bring them
back all of the Rangers.

725
00:48:32,389 --> 00:48:34,819
You must train your
team to stop Rita...

726
00:48:34,993 --> 00:48:37,920
before she has the strength
to find the crystal.

727
00:48:38,099 --> 00:48:41,969
Okay, I'm leaving.
And I speak only for myself...

728
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:44,259
No! You speak for all of them.

729
00:48:44,555 --> 00:48:47,473
You know that deep down
what I am saying is true.

730
00:48:47,746 --> 00:48:49,639
You were born for this.

731
00:48:51,706 --> 00:48:52,706
Who exactly are you?

732
00:48:52,976 --> 00:48:54,679
Really?
Now you gonna ask me who I am?

733
00:48:54,879 --> 00:48:56,620
- Look, her name is Didi.
- Trini.

734
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:57,844
She's new at school

735
00:48:57,845 --> 00:49:00,421
transferred in a month ago.
We have English together, right?

736
00:49:00,621 --> 00:49:01,760
I have been in Angel Grove,

737
00:49:01,830 --> 00:49:03,685
for over a year now we
have Biology together.

738
00:49:03,861 --> 00:49:05,827
- Good talk.
- Wait, look.

739
00:49:06,111 --> 00:49:08,538
None of us really know each other,
okay?

740
00:49:08,890 --> 00:49:11,842
Bu somehow,
we were all in the same place...

741
00:49:12,077 --> 00:49:14,620
at the same time when
Billy found those coins.

742
00:49:14,916 --> 00:49:15,044
And.

743
00:49:15,114 --> 00:49:16,821
No, Wait wait.
Can I ask a question?

744
00:49:17,446 --> 00:49:18,963
Are we really superheroes?

745
00:49:19,033 --> 00:49:21,250
We're More like Iron
Man or Spider-Man?

746
00:49:21,424 --> 00:49:24,223
Cause I feel like I've been bit by
a spider, but I feel really good...

747
00:49:24,571 --> 00:49:26,527
- I just feel good.
- Look bro, trust me.

748
00:49:26,725 --> 00:49:28,093
You're not a superhero.

749
00:49:28,293 --> 00:49:30,333
Why are you talking like to us
like you're the boss?

750
00:49:30,378 --> 00:49:32,990
Hey, hold up.
Can any of this Rita stuff be real?

751
00:49:33,195 --> 00:49:35,447
- Can any of it be true?
- I don't know.

752
00:49:35,636 --> 00:49:38,830
But I know that the answer to
what's wrong with us...

753
00:49:38,929 --> 00:49:42,400
and what's happening to us, is here.

754
00:49:45,495 --> 00:49:47,156
So... What are you saying?

755
00:49:48,019 --> 00:49:49,848
I think we gotta come back.

756
00:49:50,602 --> 00:49:54,725
I can't make you come back here,
but 4'o clock tomorrow

757
00:49:55,809 --> 00:49:56,886
I will be here.

758
00:49:57,357 --> 00:49:59,194
Hey, Jason. We don't...

759
00:50:01,984 --> 00:50:02,984
Of course!

760
00:50:03,242 --> 00:50:06,226
I do not know, I didn't think
about that one in the first place.

761
00:50:49,162 --> 00:50:50,478
So..Where were you today?

762
00:50:50,662 --> 00:50:53,176
Were you with friends?
Do you have any friends?

763
00:50:53,319 --> 00:50:55,834
- Why are you do tired?
- You did ask her four questions...

764
00:50:56,062 --> 00:50:57,200
before she's even
answered the first.

765
00:50:57,270 --> 00:50:58,750
Because she's like
a ghost around here.

766
00:50:58,808 --> 00:51:00,788
She needs to start communicating.

767
00:51:00,982 --> 00:51:02,324
- June.
- Say something.

768
00:51:02,563 --> 00:51:04,815
- Speak! I just...
- Relax.

769
00:51:04,934 --> 00:51:06,642
Okay, relax.

770
00:51:07,921 --> 00:51:09,953
Okay, Trini, let's start over.

771
00:51:10,726 --> 00:51:13,089
Please tell us one
thing you did today.

772
00:51:15,475 --> 00:51:17,197
Me and four kids from Angel Grove

773
00:51:17,267 --> 00:51:19,197
found a spaceship
buried underground.

774
00:51:19,399 --> 00:51:20,501
What?

775
00:51:21,777 --> 00:51:24,058
I'm pretty sure I'm a superhero.

776
00:51:25,471 --> 00:51:26,474
Cool!

777
00:51:26,686 --> 00:51:28,040
Not cool.

778
00:51:28,248 --> 00:51:29,761
Pee in that cup!

779
00:51:35,010 --> 00:51:36,998
It's to remind me of my screw up?

780
00:51:37,361 --> 00:51:38,501
No.

781
00:51:39,425 --> 00:51:41,769
Wrecking yard only offered
me 300 bucks for it.

782
00:51:44,297 --> 00:51:47,077
You know the frame's straight and
the engine still runs.

783
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,067
It's a terrible situation.
You gotta come with me.

784
00:51:55,909 --> 00:51:57,894
A series of grisly crimes scenes

785
00:51:57,964 --> 00:52:01,127
has the sleepy fishing hamlet
of Angel Grove reeling

786
00:52:02,541 --> 00:52:04,711
bodies were discovered
on a fishing boat.

787
00:52:04,873 --> 00:52:07,499
This raft of violence..

788
00:52:20,450 --> 00:52:21,796
What the hell are you doing?

789
00:52:22,001 --> 00:52:27,234
I need gold,
I build my beautiful Goldar.

790
00:52:27,410 --> 00:52:31,546
Goldar takes the Zeo Crystal
I take the universe.

791
00:52:32,682 --> 00:52:33,930
They do!

792
00:53:09,634 --> 00:53:10,825
So Crazy girl.

793
00:53:10,831 --> 00:53:11,699
Hey.

794
00:53:11,747 --> 00:53:12,747
Shall we do this?

795
00:53:14,369 --> 00:53:17,239
You need to follow the three rules
to being a Power Ranger.

796
00:53:17,556 --> 00:53:20,105
You must never use your
powers for personal gain.

797
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:24,498
You must never escalate a fight.
Unless your enemy forces you to.

798
00:53:24,860 --> 00:53:28,092
And you must never
reveal your identity. ever.

799
00:53:28,228 --> 00:53:31,076
To assume your ranger identities
you need to morph.

800
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,046
Have any of you morphed before?

801
00:53:33,263 --> 00:53:35,809
Yes, but only in the shower.

802
00:53:36,324 --> 00:53:39,211
Okay, okay, let's step into
the footprints, please.

803
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:40,858
Let's try this.

804
00:53:42,526 --> 00:53:44,654
Standing in this circle as a team,

805
00:53:44,724 --> 00:53:47,415
You can easily connect
to the morphin' grid.

806
00:53:47,702 --> 00:53:48,581
Do you feel it?

807
00:53:48,704 --> 00:53:49,704
Yeah they do.

808
00:53:49,864 --> 00:53:51,594
No, not feeling it.

809
00:53:51,819 --> 00:53:54,044
You need to morph to get your armor.

810
00:53:54,817 --> 00:53:56,894
I knew it! We do get armor.

811
00:53:56,941 --> 00:53:59,852
Jason! We get armor!

812
00:54:00,056 --> 00:54:02,054
Cool! When you give us the armor?

813
00:54:02,143 --> 00:54:03,927
You already have it inside of you.

814
00:54:04,114 --> 00:54:06,492
You bring it out by
connecting to each other.

815
00:54:06,582 --> 00:54:08,424
And connecting to the Morphing grid.

816
00:54:08,859 --> 00:54:11,558
Bury your minds and focus.

817
00:54:12,267 --> 00:54:17,433
Power Rangers were a legion of
warriors sworn to protect life.

818
00:54:17,533 --> 00:54:18,339
Yes!

819
00:54:18,486 --> 00:54:21,229
They must become those warriors.

820
00:54:21,328 --> 00:54:22,973
Become the warriors!

821
00:54:32,493 --> 00:54:33,493
What?

822
00:54:33,525 --> 00:54:35,026
What? Did It worked?

823
00:54:35,202 --> 00:54:37,261
Alpha 5, why they didn't they morph?

824
00:54:37,331 --> 00:54:39,801
I do not know, sir.
It is disturbing.

825
00:54:40,024 --> 00:54:42,653
Very disturbing.
Might take some time.

826
00:54:42,899 --> 00:54:44,223
We don't have time!

827
00:54:44,526 --> 00:54:46,709
If they can't morph,
what are we supposed to do?

828
00:54:46,815 --> 00:54:49,549
They will have to train without
armor, they need to prepare.

829
00:54:49,792 --> 00:54:53,051
Without armor?
Sir that will be very painful,

830
00:54:53,203 --> 00:54:55,065
Take them down to the pit.

831
00:54:56,583 --> 00:54:59,109
Alright, follow me.
We are going to the pit!

832
00:54:59,252 --> 00:55:01,114
Jason I don't want to find out
what the pit is.

833
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:04,050
So, This is the pit.
It's nice, right?

834
00:55:04,147 --> 00:55:06,352
Alpha 5, begin the exercise.

835
00:55:06,547 --> 00:55:07,291
Sorry, guys.

836
00:55:07,491 --> 00:55:09,322
- What exercise?
- Chill out dude.

837
00:55:14,043 --> 00:55:18,142
These creatures before you
are simulations of Rita's army.

838
00:55:18,198 --> 00:55:21,598
They are called... to get to her.

839
00:55:21,837 --> 00:55:23,241
No, no, no, Jason.

840
00:55:23,577 --> 00:55:26,284
Relax, guys. It's a hologram.

841
00:55:26,595 --> 00:55:28,481
Like video games. Look.

842
00:55:30,806 --> 00:55:32,767
Strong ass hologram.

843
00:55:33,568 --> 00:55:35,006
Not a video game.

844
00:55:35,302 --> 00:55:37,805
This is why you must
morph into your armor.

845
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:40,621
If Rita becomes strong enough
to build her army...

846
00:55:40,779 --> 00:55:43,029
The real beginning of the end.

847
00:55:43,334 --> 00:55:45,667
Rangers Welcome to training.

848
00:55:45,903 --> 00:55:47,711
I'm so excited you guys are back.

849
00:55:48,218 --> 00:55:49,627
Aim for the center..

850
00:55:50,358 --> 00:55:51,365
Once more time.

851
00:55:51,694 --> 00:55:53,933
Dodging their punches.
Find their weak site.

852
00:55:55,446 --> 00:55:57,912
Let's go a couple of hits. Okay?

853
00:55:58,174 --> 00:55:59,174
No let's try that again.

854
00:55:59,364 --> 00:56:00,364
This is exciting.

855
00:56:02,022 --> 00:56:03,022
Yeah, Trini!

856
00:56:05,819 --> 00:56:07,034
Ready, master Billy?

857
00:56:08,818 --> 00:56:11,600
You need to learn the
element of surprise.

858
00:56:12,039 --> 00:56:13,808
- Ready? Let's go again.
- Okay.

859
00:56:13,976 --> 00:56:15,832
Billy, light on your feet.

860
00:56:17,246 --> 00:56:18,246
Hands up.

861
00:56:28,602 --> 00:56:30,976
Play with some energy now! let's go!

862
00:56:35,105 --> 00:56:37,944
Focus! focus everybody just focus!

863
00:56:41,156 --> 00:56:42,581
Lucky shot.

864
00:56:44,965 --> 00:56:47,247
You guys all know
you can be murdered, right?

865
00:57:00,836 --> 00:57:01,836
No.

866
00:57:06,750 --> 00:57:09,744
You must shade your own mask
to wear this armor.

867
00:57:10,740 --> 00:57:12,139
I don't feel anything!

868
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:13,389
No.

869
00:57:13,444 --> 00:57:15,010
Take them down to the pit.

870
00:57:15,232 --> 00:57:16,232
Watch me.

871
00:57:16,454 --> 00:57:18,956
Slip, grab, lift!

872
00:57:19,746 --> 00:57:20,994
Yeah!

873
00:57:21,142 --> 00:57:23,119
Slip, grab, lift!

874
00:57:25,278 --> 00:57:26,278
Yes!

875
00:57:40,579 --> 00:57:42,350
<b><i>We SHOULD start a band</i></b>

876
00:57:44,949 --> 00:57:49,558
Think only of each other and the
morphing grid will open to you.

877
00:57:50,424 --> 00:57:51,468
It's working?

878
00:57:51,797 --> 00:57:53,745
- No, it's not.
- Come on!

879
00:57:53,889 --> 00:57:54,889
Try harder!

880
00:57:57,417 --> 00:57:59,028
I have been concentrated though.

881
00:57:59,328 --> 00:58:01,605
All we need to do is
just concentrate...

882
00:58:01,845 --> 00:58:04,274
- Don't tell me to concentrate.
- Just follow my lead.

883
00:58:04,469 --> 00:58:07,327
- Let's not fight with each other.
- Now is not the time.

884
00:58:10,472 --> 00:58:12,556
Come on. let's go to train.

885
00:58:13,733 --> 00:58:15,974
The information we need
to triangulate the location of...

886
00:58:16,138 --> 00:58:18,945
The Crystal was lost in the battle.

887
00:58:19,153 --> 00:58:20,553
Billy Are you listening to me?

888
00:58:21,069 --> 00:58:22,327
Billy What are you doing?

889
00:58:22,581 --> 00:58:23,581
Billy!

890
00:58:24,463 --> 00:58:27,856
Where is the crystal
Find him, Billy, find him.

891
00:58:28,426 --> 00:58:29,993
Where is the crystal?

892
00:58:30,534 --> 00:58:31,534
There.

893
00:58:31,816 --> 00:58:34,672
17 degrees north...

894
00:58:34,974 --> 00:58:36,761
Hey, idiot,
watch where you're going.

895
00:58:44,224 --> 00:58:45,711
Krispy Kreme DOUGHNUTS

896
00:58:45,812 --> 00:58:49,417
Two fishermen were led to rest
today at St Andrews cemetery.

897
00:58:49,518 --> 00:58:52,163
Residents of Angel Grove
are feeling the shock.

898
00:58:52,364 --> 00:58:54,432
Fear has the town on edge.

899
00:58:54,733 --> 00:58:57,683
The series of murders
has police baffled...

900
00:58:57,883 --> 00:59:00,546
as police have linked the loss
of gold to each crime scene.

901
00:59:00,922 --> 00:59:05,232
What is now being Angel Grove's
gold killer is still on the loose/.

902
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:07,508
If Rita manages to create Goldar...

903
00:59:07,909 --> 00:59:09,189
Are you listening to me?

904
00:59:09,259 --> 00:59:11,393
And he rips the crystal
from the ground..

905
00:59:11,494 --> 00:59:14,894
..It will be like ten thousand
nuclear bombs washing over earth.

906
00:59:15,095 --> 00:59:16,386
That supposed to freak us out?

907
00:59:16,486 --> 00:59:18,678
We keep making this harder.
We are busting our asses,

908
00:59:18,879 --> 00:59:20,035
Feel free to throw us
a bone at some point.

909
00:59:20,036 --> 00:59:22,783
Yes, I see you busting your asses.

910
00:59:23,034 --> 00:59:25,053
So I've decided to give
you some inspiration.

911
00:59:25,555 --> 00:59:29,330
What you will find beyond this wall
will forever change your life.

912
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,148
Come on.

913
00:59:35,485 --> 00:59:38,631
- The Zords! Pretty cool, right?
- Yeah.

914
00:59:38,831 --> 00:59:41,967
They take on the form of most
powerful organism on the planet.

915
00:59:42,168 --> 00:59:46,103
When these Zords formed,
dinosaurs reigned supreme.

916
00:59:46,204 --> 00:59:48,316
They will be an extension of you.

917
00:59:48,817 --> 00:59:52,450
And there power is
all but limitless.

918
00:59:54,729 --> 00:59:55,943
They are incredible.

919
00:59:56,143 --> 00:59:58,320
But you are not
ready for this power.

920
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:02,306
When you morph, your armor
will make you one with the zords.

921
01:00:02,506 --> 01:00:04,247
Come on. Let's go train.

922
01:00:04,346 --> 01:00:06,544
Today is the day you become Rangers!

923
01:00:06,645 --> 01:00:07,992
I can feel it!

924
01:00:09,748 --> 01:00:10,601
Okay.

925
01:00:10,701 --> 01:00:11,803
Let's go.

926
01:00:11,902 --> 01:00:12,902
Yeah.

927
01:00:13,538 --> 01:00:14,740
Let's go.

928
01:00:22,055 --> 01:00:24,277
This was a bad idea. Okay, okay.

929
01:00:24,378 --> 01:00:26,791
Signals, brakes.
Brakes, I need the brakes!

930
01:00:26,892 --> 01:00:28,491
Manual. Manual.

931
01:00:28,691 --> 01:00:31,868
Where are the breaks. Alpha 5?

932
01:00:34,740 --> 01:00:37,795
Oh, God hey, Move! Move!

933
01:00:37,998 --> 01:00:39,085
Out of the way!

934
01:00:40,955 --> 01:00:44,824
Oh, Tailing on the mountain.

935
01:00:46,735 --> 01:00:50,160
After you remember that today's train
lesson the important thing is to...

936
01:00:50,260 --> 01:00:51,760
Wait. Where is Zack?

937
01:00:51,862 --> 01:00:52,862
Seriously?

938
01:00:55,604 --> 01:00:58,383
Run, run! Run!

939
01:00:58,937 --> 01:01:01,155
Run! Run!

940
01:01:03,662 --> 01:01:05,397
It's bad!

941
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:13,790
You're alright?

942
01:01:18,504 --> 01:01:21,505
Alright, my bad, my bad.
That's on me right there.

943
01:01:21,608 --> 01:01:22,683
What's your problem?

944
01:01:22,753 --> 01:01:24,902
You could've killed yourself,
or us.

945
01:01:25,003 --> 01:01:26,764
- Back off, boss.
- Hey!

946
01:01:27,333 --> 01:01:29,289
No, Come on guys. Wow.

947
01:01:29,688 --> 01:01:31,809
- Guys, guys, come on.
- Watch it.

948
01:01:31,912 --> 01:01:33,352
Wait. What are you doing?

949
01:01:37,763 --> 01:01:39,500
Stop fighting, please!

950
01:01:48,071 --> 01:01:49,151
What?

951
01:01:50,323 --> 01:01:51,821
Stand still.

952
01:01:52,221 --> 01:01:54,089
What? I got something on my face...?

953
01:01:54,490 --> 01:01:55,590
Yeah!

954
01:01:56,691 --> 01:01:59,288
- Ok, now that's cool!
- Oh, Yeah!

955
01:01:59,487 --> 01:02:01,220
Don't touch it.
Zack, don't touch it.

956
01:02:01,290 --> 01:02:02,252
Zack, do not touch.

957
01:02:06,264 --> 01:02:07,282
Where'd it go?

958
01:02:07,382 --> 01:02:09,668
Bring it back, bring it back, dude.

959
01:02:10,037 --> 01:02:11,128
Get out.

960
01:02:11,327 --> 01:02:14,887
The training is over for today.
Go home.

961
01:02:14,987 --> 01:02:18,334
I'm sorry, he just morphed.
He did it. You saw it, right?

962
01:02:18,435 --> 01:02:20,507
Do it again. All of you.

963
01:02:22,109 --> 01:02:25,390
- Billy, how'd you do that?
- Come on, Billy, let's do it.

964
01:02:25,490 --> 01:02:27,050
Come on, do it again.

965
01:02:30,096 --> 01:02:33,121
- Do it again.
- I'm trying. I can't focus

966
01:02:33,974 --> 01:02:36,038
Billy, how'd you do it? Show us.

967
01:02:37,893 --> 01:02:39,665
Okay, we don't know how.

968
01:02:39,767 --> 01:02:41,066
That's what I thought.

969
01:02:41,167 --> 01:02:44,834
If you can't morph,
You are not Rangers.

970
01:02:45,035 --> 01:02:47,128
Go home, all of you.

971
01:02:48,844 --> 01:02:49,960
Now what?

972
01:02:50,364 --> 01:02:52,189
- Got damn!
- Seriously?

973
01:03:00,152 --> 01:03:01,232
Hey, guys.

974
01:03:01,432 --> 01:03:04,806
Guys.
Look, I'mma stay up here tonight.

975
01:03:04,908 --> 01:03:08,850
Make a fire, I got some food.
If you guys wanna stay

976
01:03:10,429 --> 01:03:11,429
I'm down.

977
01:03:13,021 --> 01:03:14,021
Alright.

978
01:03:14,104 --> 01:03:15,104
Cool.

979
01:03:15,303 --> 01:03:17,633
Jason's failing experiment.

980
01:03:17,833 --> 01:03:19,686
I shall destroy Rita myself.

981
01:03:19,889 --> 01:03:22,389
There must be a way to
free me from this wall.

982
01:03:22,490 --> 01:03:27,027
Yes, but the irony is that
you need these rangers to morph.

983
01:03:27,229 --> 01:03:29,421
If they morph,
you can harness that energy...

984
01:03:29,422 --> 01:03:31,740
to regenerate your body
and come back through.

985
01:03:31,842 --> 01:03:33,990
No, there's got to another way!
I can't...

986
01:03:34,192 --> 01:03:36,593
What, Zordon? You can't what?

987
01:03:36,753 --> 01:03:40,236
Wait for us dumb kids to morph
so that you can come back to life.

988
01:03:40,398 --> 01:03:42,136
That's what all this has been about,
right?

989
01:03:42,737 --> 01:03:44,002
You coming back?

990
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:46,879
This has only ever been about
to protecting the crystal

991
01:03:47,081 --> 01:03:49,139
Rita could be building
Goldar as we speak.

992
01:03:49,340 --> 01:03:51,171
Don't underestimate me or my team.

993
01:03:51,271 --> 01:03:52,601
You can't stop him..

994
01:03:53,002 --> 01:03:57,505
She will have him dig up the crystal
and life on earth..will die.

995
01:03:57,903 --> 01:03:59,023
And we need you.

996
01:03:59,624 --> 01:04:02,210
Because you were so successful
in stopping her last time.

997
01:04:02,412 --> 01:04:04,983
I died burying those coins...

998
01:04:05,184 --> 01:04:08,721
In hopes they will
find next real Rangers.

999
01:04:09,030 --> 01:04:10,618
Those who are worthy.

1000
01:04:10,818 --> 01:04:12,571
I'm sorry to disappoint you!

1001
01:04:12,672 --> 01:04:15,306
I don't need to stand here and
have you tell me what I did wrong.

1002
01:04:15,507 --> 01:04:16,811
I can go home and get that.

1003
01:04:16,914 --> 01:04:20,700
Jason! You need me out of this wall.

1004
01:04:20,902 --> 01:04:22,750
To help lead this team!

1005
01:04:23,049 --> 01:04:24,480
Your team is dead.

1006
01:04:25,326 --> 01:04:27,612
And you're just as scared as we are.

1007
01:04:33,747 --> 01:04:38,047
These are off 24 carat Gold.

1008
01:04:38,448 --> 01:04:39,472
I'll be right with you.

1009
01:04:47,343 --> 01:04:48,987
You're so sweet.

1010
01:04:52,573 --> 01:04:54,568
I'll be right back.

1011
01:04:58,534 --> 01:04:59,906
Can I help you?

1012
01:05:01,128 --> 01:05:02,128
Gold.

1013
01:05:03,377 --> 01:05:05,414
I'm interested...

1014
01:05:06,039 --> 01:05:07,170
gold.

1015
01:05:08,021 --> 01:05:09,021
Yeah.

1016
01:05:14,027 --> 01:05:16,962
We have some very nice pieces here.

1017
01:05:32,017 --> 01:05:33,253
Come closer.

1018
01:05:33,348 --> 01:05:36,105
Closer, closer. Closer.

1019
01:05:42,953 --> 01:05:44,037
This.

1020
01:05:44,446 --> 01:05:45,745
Give it to me!

1021
01:05:45,948 --> 01:05:47,369
Okay. There you go.

1022
01:05:57,167 --> 01:05:58,167
Grow.

1023
01:05:59,579 --> 01:06:01,035
Grow.

1024
01:06:09,394 --> 01:06:10,796
Police! Don't move!

1025
01:06:11,258 --> 01:06:15,669
Drop it, weapon, put your hands
on your head. Do it Now!

1026
01:06:15,771 --> 01:06:17,015
Do it, I say, lady!

1027
01:06:17,116 --> 01:06:18,215
Lady?

1028
01:06:18,617 --> 01:06:20,846
I like the sound of lady.

1029
01:06:20,964 --> 01:06:23,171
Get on the ground and
you won't get hurt.

1030
01:06:35,069 --> 01:06:37,656
Unit 5,
I need backup at Jewelers Phoenix.

1031
01:06:37,798 --> 01:06:40,097
Shots were fired.
I repeat, shots were fired.

1032
01:06:41,347 --> 01:06:42,347
Down!

1033
01:06:51,042 --> 01:06:54,604
It's been too long since
I raised my beautiful creatures.

1034
01:06:56,972 --> 01:06:58,910
Did you miss me?

1035
01:07:07,606 --> 01:07:08,989
Oh my God.

1036
01:07:09,188 --> 01:07:10,588
Kill him.

1037
01:07:15,043 --> 01:07:16,356
- Alright.
- Ha-ha.

1038
01:07:16,658 --> 01:07:20,101
"How we are stuck in this wall
I will make that jump."

1039
01:07:22,287 --> 01:07:23,641
What happened back there?

1040
01:07:23,842 --> 01:07:26,134
Nothing, don't worry about it.

1041
01:07:29,087 --> 01:07:30,530
Billy, how'd you do it?

1042
01:07:31,741 --> 01:07:33,177
How'd you morph?

1043
01:07:33,843 --> 01:07:34,843
I don't know.

1044
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:37,959
What do you guys saying him about
one more trying to morph?

1045
01:07:38,161 --> 01:07:42,052
"You must shade your masks
to wear this armor."

1046
01:07:43,886 --> 01:07:48,578
"Think only of each other and the
morphin' grid will open to you".

1047
01:07:48,579 --> 01:07:49,970
Yeah, that's better.

1048
01:07:50,742 --> 01:07:53,337
Or maybe it's Cause we
don't know each other.

1049
01:07:53,407 --> 01:07:55,294
Maybe that's why we can't morph.

1050
01:07:57,499 --> 01:07:58,499
Okay.

1051
01:07:58,962 --> 01:08:02,481
No, I am serious,
let's do this for real

1052
01:08:03,082 --> 01:08:06,605
I am Jack and I am a Power Ranger.

1053
01:08:08,900 --> 01:08:10,967
- Hi, Zack.
- Hi, Zack.

1054
01:08:11,554 --> 01:08:12,554
True

1055
01:08:12,899 --> 01:08:16,126
I live in the Melody
mobile home park.

1056
01:08:16,326 --> 01:08:18,074
It's just me and my mum.

1057
01:08:18,674 --> 01:08:19,852
And my mom?

1058
01:08:20,552 --> 01:08:22,609
My mom is the best!

1059
01:08:26,717 --> 01:08:28,878
But my Mom. she's sick.

1060
01:08:29,629 --> 01:08:31,239
I do what I can...

1061
01:08:32,515 --> 01:08:33,883
but I'm scared.

1062
01:08:34,380 --> 01:08:37,541
Sometimes I get too
scared to stay the night

1063
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:41,219
because I'm afraid she can't make it.

1064
01:08:43,291 --> 01:08:44,867
And if she goes...

1065
01:08:46,745 --> 01:08:48,201
When she goes...

1066
01:08:49,952 --> 01:08:51,609
I got nobody else.

1067
01:08:55,700 --> 01:08:56,799
Look.

1068
01:08:57,678 --> 01:09:00,104
I think being with you
guys is good for me.

1069
01:09:02,736 --> 01:09:03,446
Let's do that.

1070
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:06,452
Let's tell our secrets
it will help us.

1071
01:09:07,139 --> 01:09:08,743
Okay, I got a secret.

1072
01:09:09,784 --> 01:09:12,149
- I like country music.
- What?

1073
01:09:12,494 --> 01:09:14,646
As a matter of fact,
I love country music.

1074
01:09:16,642 --> 01:09:17,728
And I don't...

1075
01:09:18,912 --> 01:09:20,712
I don't miss my dad that much

1076
01:09:23,045 --> 01:09:25,467
I mean coming to the mine
with him was all I had.

1077
01:09:26,550 --> 01:09:30,557
But.. coming to the mine with
you guys is just as good.

1078
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:32,960
Yeah.

1079
01:09:33,005 --> 01:09:35,284
Biggest secret is
why're you in detention.

1080
01:09:35,470 --> 01:09:37,532
- I blew up my lunch box.
- What?

1081
01:09:37,658 --> 01:09:39,152
But it was an accident.

1082
01:09:39,368 --> 01:09:40,871
- What?
- Of course.

1083
01:09:41,158 --> 01:09:42,416
My lunch box was in my locker

1084
01:09:42,417 --> 01:09:44,948
boom goes the lunch box,
in detention goes Billy.

1085
01:09:45,311 --> 01:09:47,396
But let's not forget
that Kimberly Hart

1086
01:09:47,466 --> 01:09:49,221
was also in detention too so...

1087
01:09:52,077 --> 01:09:53,077
Not tonight.

1088
01:09:54,599 --> 01:09:55,641
Skip me.

1089
01:09:59,283 --> 01:10:00,390
What about you dude?

1090
01:10:00,946 --> 01:10:03,105
Why don't you tell us
who you really are?

1091
01:10:03,259 --> 01:10:05,598
Because everyone knows
exactly who I am.

1092
01:10:06,066 --> 01:10:07,193
Okay.

1093
01:10:08,159 --> 01:10:09,727
What about you, crazy girl?

1094
01:10:09,849 --> 01:10:12,471
I could tell you anything and
you would have to believe me.

1095
01:10:17,515 --> 01:10:18,515
Okay.

1096
01:10:19,808 --> 01:10:21,179
I'm the new girl.

1097
01:10:21,676 --> 01:10:22,900
Always.

1098
01:10:24,593 --> 01:10:26,616
Three schools in three years.

1099
01:10:28,805 --> 01:10:31,730
I like it that way, you know,
it's just easier.

1100
01:10:31,937 --> 01:10:34,225
Nobody ever has to get to know me...

1101
01:10:34,542 --> 01:10:38,063
my parents don't have to worry
about my relationships.

1102
01:10:39,644 --> 01:10:41,028
Boyfriend troubles?

1103
01:10:41,261 --> 01:10:42,261
Yeah.

1104
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:45,036
Boyfriend troubles.

1105
01:10:48,024 --> 01:10:49,454
Girlfriend troubles.?

1106
01:10:55,515 --> 01:10:58,059
My family is so normal.

1107
01:10:59,006 --> 01:11:00,253
Too normal.

1108
01:11:03,037 --> 01:11:04,938
They believe in labels.

1109
01:11:07,023 --> 01:11:09,273
They would like for me to...

1110
01:11:10,372 --> 01:11:11,751
dress differently.

1111
01:11:12,970 --> 01:11:14,285
Talk more.

1112
01:11:16,448 --> 01:11:18,820
Have the kinds of friends
they want me to have.

1113
01:11:21,133 --> 01:11:24,266
I don't know how to tell them
what's really going on with me.

1114
01:11:29,234 --> 01:11:31,741
I never said any of this out loud.

1115
01:11:31,983 --> 01:11:34,901
Well, it's cool. You with us now.

1116
01:11:37,687 --> 01:11:38,687
Am I?

1117
01:11:40,276 --> 01:11:41,542
What does that mean?

1118
01:11:42,154 --> 01:11:43,831
When all this is over?

1119
01:11:44,693 --> 01:11:46,555
Are we Power Rangers or?

1120
01:11:49,157 --> 01:11:51,313
Are we friends?

1121
01:12:19,964 --> 01:12:21,374
Do you know who I am?

1122
01:12:23,525 --> 01:12:24,567
Yes.

1123
01:12:25,769 --> 01:12:28,152
I was once just like you.

1124
01:12:29,233 --> 01:12:31,739
So pretty.

1125
01:12:32,324 --> 01:12:33,846
Innocent.

1126
01:12:34,298 --> 01:12:38,405
Are all the rangers on Zordan's
new team as young as you?

1127
01:12:40,454 --> 01:12:41,796
Delightful!

1128
01:12:43,303 --> 01:12:44,837
Have you morphed yet?

1129
01:12:47,314 --> 01:12:49,197
Trick question.

1130
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:50,892
If you could morph,

1131
01:12:50,962 --> 01:12:54,732
we would be having a very
different conversation.

1132
01:12:56,740 --> 01:12:58,823
The Yellow Ranger.

1133
01:13:00,202 --> 01:13:01,770
Should I kill you?

1134
01:13:02,438 --> 01:13:05,793
I killed the yellow Ranger before.

1135
01:13:06,674 --> 01:13:08,397
And I loved it!

1136
01:13:08,752 --> 01:13:11,036
Oh, you want your armor.

1137
01:13:11,344 --> 01:13:15,417
I'll show you mine
if you show me yours.

1138
01:13:30,285 --> 01:13:32,455
No, please, you're hurting me.

1139
01:13:32,531 --> 01:13:33,836
You are so strong!

1140
01:13:36,219 --> 01:13:37,883
I'm just kidding.

1141
01:13:39,524 --> 01:13:42,038
You've guts full, little yellow!

1142
01:13:42,294 --> 01:13:43,746
I see myself in you.

1143
01:13:44,024 --> 01:13:47,640
I was an outsider on Zordan's team,
just like you.

1144
01:13:48,485 --> 01:13:50,656
All I need to know is...

1145
01:13:51,167 --> 01:13:53,007
where is the Zeo Crystal.

1146
01:13:53,073 --> 01:13:54,966
I don't know.

1147
01:13:55,757 --> 01:13:57,454
Sadly, I believe you.

1148
01:13:57,903 --> 01:14:01,179
Tomorrow I am going to
destroy Angel Grove.

1149
01:14:01,513 --> 01:14:04,179
But in exchange for your life...

1150
01:14:04,423 --> 01:14:08,177
you will find out where that
crystal is and you will come to me.

1151
01:14:08,340 --> 01:14:12,017
We can have a little deal,
Didi my friend.

1152
01:14:25,379 --> 01:14:26,941
- Kim!
- It's me.

1153
01:14:28,005 --> 01:14:29,595
How did you get in here?

1154
01:14:29,933 --> 01:14:33,426
I am a super hero.
And you left your window open.

1155
01:14:33,619 --> 01:14:34,619
So everything okay?

1156
01:14:36,129 --> 01:14:38,757
I think I'm the
reason we can't morph.

1157
01:14:40,730 --> 01:14:42,371
I haven't really been honest.

1158
01:14:42,595 --> 01:14:43,595
Okay.

1159
01:14:43,651 --> 01:14:45,752
I punched Ty Fleming on the face...

1160
01:14:45,843 --> 01:14:48,920
because he told everyone I was
the meanest person he ever met.

1161
01:14:49,770 --> 01:14:50,770
And he was right.

1162
01:14:51,203 --> 01:14:53,192
- That cannot be true.
- Okay.

1163
01:14:55,503 --> 01:14:56,503
Whoa!

1164
01:14:56,612 --> 01:14:58,331
- Yeah.
- You took that picture?

1165
01:14:58,558 --> 01:15:01,937
No. Amanda Clark,
took that picture, of herself.

1166
01:15:02,453 --> 01:15:05,127
But she shared it with me privately.

1167
01:15:05,883 --> 01:15:07,144
She trusted me.

1168
01:15:07,231 --> 01:15:09,604
And you sent that pic to Ty?

1169
01:15:10,017 --> 01:15:11,561
With a text that said.

1170
01:15:11,965 --> 01:15:14,202
"Is this the girl you wanna
bring home to your mom?"

1171
01:15:16,184 --> 01:15:19,219
I did not know how mean
it was until I saw her face.

1172
01:15:19,271 --> 01:15:22,141
Kim, there is literally thousands
of photos going around school

1173
01:15:22,366 --> 01:15:24,641
I don't care about them.
I care about this

1174
01:15:24,988 --> 01:15:26,338
I did this!

1175
01:15:26,469 --> 01:15:29,439
I had to sit in Mr. Detmer's office
with Amanda's father...

1176
01:15:29,507 --> 01:15:32,038
and watched as they showed him
the photo of his daughter.

1177
01:15:34,124 --> 01:15:37,536
In his eyes for the first time
I could see who I would become.

1178
01:15:37,902 --> 01:15:41,456
You know, So I lied.
I blamed everyone else.

1179
01:15:42,891 --> 01:15:44,639
I wanted to die, that's why...

1180
01:15:44,778 --> 01:15:47,752
When you asked me to run away,
I was ready.

1181
01:15:47,998 --> 01:15:49,130
Okay, listen.

1182
01:15:49,424 --> 01:15:51,846
Start over.
Erase that picture right now.

1183
01:15:51,966 --> 01:15:54,574
- Jason, it can't be erased.
- Then live with it!

1184
01:15:54,827 --> 01:15:57,947
You did an awful thing, that
does not make you a awful person.

1185
01:16:02,086 --> 01:16:04,068
Just be the person
you wanna be.

1186
01:16:14,810 --> 01:16:17,713
So we all get the same text.
So where is she?

1187
01:16:20,939 --> 01:16:21,961
I'm here!

1188
01:16:24,142 --> 01:16:25,142
Look.

1189
01:16:25,336 --> 01:16:27,043
Rita came to my house tonight.

1190
01:16:27,329 --> 01:16:28,947
- What?
- Yeah, she's real.

1191
01:16:30,012 --> 01:16:31,012
Insane.

1192
01:16:31,948 --> 01:16:33,346
She nearly killed me.

1193
01:16:34,331 --> 01:16:37,545
She's trying to get me to join her.
She said she'd spare my life

1194
01:16:37,730 --> 01:16:39,668
- if kept a secret.
- What secret?

1195
01:16:39,762 --> 01:16:42,730
Act on the destruction of
Angel Grove begins.

1196
01:16:42,866 --> 01:16:46,016
- This is real. This is the end.
- No, it's not. Where is she?

1197
01:16:46,201 --> 01:16:48,206
She said to me hear
what the dead ships live.

1198
01:16:48,431 --> 01:16:50,667
That's the boatyard by the docks,
right?

1199
01:16:50,846 --> 01:16:51,846
Let's go!

1200
01:16:57,572 --> 01:16:58,853
Are you serious?

1201
01:16:59,307 --> 01:16:59,637
No one?

1202
01:16:59,707 --> 01:17:01,832
Jason. We are not even
power rangers yet.

1203
01:17:02,006 --> 01:17:03,444
I say we go back to Zordon.

1204
01:17:03,712 --> 01:17:07,293
Hey.. The only reason Zordon
wanted us to become Power Rangers...

1205
01:17:07,468 --> 01:17:08,992
Is so that he can come back to life.

1206
01:17:09,231 --> 01:17:10,322
Why makes you say that?

1207
01:17:10,562 --> 01:17:11,646
Because he told me.

1208
01:17:12,029 --> 01:17:15,552
- Wait, so all this a lie?
- Of course it was a lie, Billy.

1209
01:17:15,969 --> 01:17:17,015
We failed.

1210
01:17:17,230 --> 01:17:19,967
Let's stop being delusional about
being a team of superheroes.

1211
01:17:20,870 --> 01:17:22,879
We are all screw-ups.

1212
01:17:23,636 --> 01:17:26,631
And as much as I hate this
scrubby bullshit town...

1213
01:17:27,403 --> 01:17:30,028
I don't wanna just sit around
and watch it die okay?

1214
01:17:31,091 --> 01:17:32,758
Let's go and do the one this

1215
01:17:32,828 --> 01:17:35,091
that's been asked of
us and kill Rita.

1216
01:17:38,889 --> 01:17:41,451
You know this is really
a bad idea, right?

1217
01:17:41,592 --> 01:17:42,592
The worst.

1218
01:17:43,668 --> 01:17:44,795
Let's vote.

1219
01:17:45,570 --> 01:17:46,717
Shove hands.

1220
01:18:03,202 --> 01:18:04,544
Let's do it.

1221
01:18:33,903 --> 01:18:34,903
Okay.

1222
01:18:35,298 --> 01:18:36,298
Okay.

1223
01:18:37,116 --> 01:18:38,368
Let's go.

1224
01:18:41,016 --> 01:18:43,511
- take the left, take the right.
- Got it.

1225
01:18:49,283 --> 01:18:50,362
We'll untie. Hold it.

1226
01:18:50,432 --> 01:18:52,745
No no.
Let's just think about this, okay?

1227
01:18:53,591 --> 01:18:54,628
Oh shit.

1228
01:18:59,565 --> 01:19:01,546
Right on time.

1229
01:19:02,240 --> 01:19:04,679
I was beginning to
think you were too dumb

1230
01:19:04,749 --> 01:19:06,831
to know where the dead ships live.

1231
01:19:09,231 --> 01:19:10,818
Let's play.

1232
01:19:36,409 --> 01:19:40,753
Five little Rangers
tied up like fish.

1233
01:19:42,666 --> 01:19:44,119
The Leader?

1234
01:19:45,903 --> 01:19:47,091
Hello, Red.

1235
01:19:50,011 --> 01:19:52,694
You're not entirely disappointing.

1236
01:19:53,457 --> 01:19:57,588
Look at you, trying to figure out
my plan. I will just tell you.

1237
01:19:57,767 --> 01:20:01,284
Yellow has led you to your death.

1238
01:20:01,578 --> 01:20:04,117
Because I'm going to kill you...

1239
01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:08,913
one by one, until you tell me...

1240
01:20:09,454 --> 01:20:10,874
Where's my crystal.

1241
01:20:11,025 --> 01:20:12,274
We don't know.

1242
01:20:12,362 --> 01:20:13,395
No, Red.

1243
01:20:14,032 --> 01:20:15,742
You don't know!

1244
01:20:15,914 --> 01:20:17,278
But guess what.

1245
01:20:17,494 --> 01:20:19,196
One of you does.

1246
01:20:20,324 --> 01:20:21,857
Who could it be?

1247
01:20:22,523 --> 01:20:25,196
Eeinie meenie mynie...

1248
01:20:25,797 --> 01:20:26,797
Blue.

1249
01:20:29,068 --> 01:20:32,233
Blue... so loyal.

1250
01:20:32,462 --> 01:20:33,527
Pure of heart.

1251
01:20:33,778 --> 01:20:36,591
Tell the class what you know!

1252
01:20:36,862 --> 01:20:38,397
Where is my crystal?

1253
01:20:40,954 --> 01:20:43,675
You can tell me now, Blue.

1254
01:20:43,774 --> 01:20:47,605
Or you can tell me after
I kill all of your friends.

1255
01:20:49,035 --> 01:20:50,767
- Let's start with Black.
- No!

1256
01:20:51,020 --> 01:20:52,909
Hey! no!

1257
01:20:53,411 --> 01:20:54,479
No.

1258
01:20:56,220 --> 01:20:58,080
He dies in three...

1259
01:20:58,686 --> 01:20:59,722
two...

1260
01:21:01,236 --> 01:21:02,545
Okay, okay!

1261
01:21:03,506 --> 01:21:05,381
Don't hurt my friends, alright?

1262
01:21:05,619 --> 01:21:07,175
It's at doughnut establishment.

1263
01:21:07,381 --> 01:21:10,039
Where? What does that mean?
What's it called?

1264
01:21:11,068 --> 01:21:12,315
It's a Krispy Kreme.

1265
01:21:12,381 --> 01:21:13,381
Krispy Kreme?

1266
01:21:13,576 --> 01:21:16,386
Krispy Kreme.
This is a special place?

1267
01:21:16,604 --> 01:21:18,196
- Very Special.
- It Must be.

1268
01:21:18,481 --> 01:21:21,133
The Source of life
itself is buried there.

1269
01:21:21,429 --> 01:21:24,564
Thank you Blue for being so weak.

1270
01:21:24,773 --> 01:21:28,800
Zordon will lose all respect for me
If I don't kill you.

1271
01:21:29,570 --> 01:21:31,293
- At least one of you.
- What?

1272
01:21:33,404 --> 01:21:34,404
No!

1273
01:21:36,243 --> 01:21:37,243
Billy!

1274
01:21:38,265 --> 01:21:39,265
Billy! Billy!

1275
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:41,559
- Jason, we gotta help him.
- Billy!

1276
01:21:41,755 --> 01:21:42,755
Billy!

1277
01:21:46,743 --> 01:21:48,865
You are not ready to kill me.

1278
01:21:49,936 --> 01:21:52,074
You are not worthy.

1279
01:21:57,573 --> 01:21:58,982
Give me your hand!

1280
01:22:11,189 --> 01:22:13,241
- Billy?
- Is he gonna be okay, right?

1281
01:22:15,076 --> 01:22:16,076
Come on.

1282
01:22:16,311 --> 01:22:19,590
Hey hey. You can, spec guy Come on.

1283
01:22:21,290 --> 01:22:22,290
He's dead.

1284
01:22:31,123 --> 01:22:32,239
He is dead.

1285
01:22:33,093 --> 01:22:34,093
No.

1286
01:22:43,990 --> 01:22:46,205
We SHOULD start a band.

1287
01:22:51,061 --> 01:22:52,175
Pick him up.

1288
01:22:54,036 --> 01:22:55,734
Help me pick him up!

1289
01:22:58,383 --> 01:22:59,383
Come on!

1290
01:23:23,074 --> 01:23:24,600
It's okay. It's okay.

1291
01:23:24,836 --> 01:23:27,435
Come on, Billy. We got you, buddy.

1292
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:29,801
Take him, take him to the cave.

1293
01:23:31,899 --> 01:23:32,899
Yeah.

1294
01:23:53,303 --> 01:23:54,692
- Put him down.
- Okay.

1295
01:23:55,976 --> 01:23:57,681
- Slow slow.
- Master Billy.

1296
01:23:58,808 --> 01:24:00,134
Do something, ok?

1297
01:24:00,508 --> 01:24:02,188
There must be something
you can do for him.

1298
01:24:02,272 --> 01:24:04,619
I told you that you were not ready.

1299
01:24:04,840 --> 01:24:08,029
Zordon please help us, okay? Please!

1300
01:24:08,675 --> 01:24:10,783
There is nothing that
I could do for him.

1301
01:24:11,850 --> 01:24:14,623
We were both reckless
with our teams.

1302
01:24:20,747 --> 01:24:21,920
No.

1303
01:24:24,947 --> 01:24:26,327
I am sorry.

1304
01:24:32,192 --> 01:24:33,704
I'm sorry, guys.

1305
01:24:35,527 --> 01:24:37,320
He's dead because of me.

1306
01:24:38,805 --> 01:24:40,595
No, Jason, it was all of us.

1307
01:24:40,775 --> 01:24:42,743
No I pushed it.

1308
01:24:43,049 --> 01:24:45,524
And as usual,
I made the wrong decision.

1309
01:24:45,754 --> 01:24:48,261
Out of fear, anger...

1310
01:24:49,665 --> 01:24:52,410
I don't know,
It's just so angry.

1311
01:24:55,076 --> 01:24:57,257
He's a great kid, you know.

1312
01:24:58,948 --> 01:25:00,527
And he loved us.

1313
01:25:00,732 --> 01:25:03,746
He loved being a Ranger.

1314
01:25:06,257 --> 01:25:07,849
I'm sorry, Billy.

1315
01:25:09,715 --> 01:25:12,113
I'll trade my life
for yours if I could.

1316
01:25:21,935 --> 01:25:24,356
Maybe he traded his life for us.

1317
01:25:25,265 --> 01:25:26,941
Yeah probably he did.

1318
01:25:33,288 --> 01:25:34,467
I would.

1319
01:25:37,401 --> 01:25:38,401
Me too.

1320
01:25:39,901 --> 01:25:41,839
Yeah me too.

1321
01:25:44,181 --> 01:25:45,247
Me too.

1322
01:25:48,559 --> 01:25:50,176
Just the four of us now.

1323
01:25:55,438 --> 01:25:56,783
The truth is...

1324
01:25:57,620 --> 01:26:00,062
whatever we've said to each other...

1325
01:26:00,798 --> 01:26:02,130
It does not matter.

1326
01:26:03,406 --> 01:26:04,541
This...

1327
01:26:04,862 --> 01:26:07,425
this is the only thing that matters.

1328
01:26:11,143 --> 01:26:12,143
She is right.

1329
01:26:17,893 --> 01:26:18,920
Zordon!

1330
01:26:19,050 --> 01:26:21,621
Zordon! Look at the Grid!
This is your time!

1331
01:26:21,946 --> 01:26:23,141
Do you see it?

1332
01:26:23,322 --> 01:26:25,045
The grid is open, step through!

1333
01:26:25,244 --> 01:26:26,396
Yes, I see it.

1334
01:26:27,124 --> 01:26:28,134
I see it.

1335
01:26:30,853 --> 01:26:32,323
Get through, Zordon!

1336
01:26:33,283 --> 01:26:35,345
- Hey!
- What's happening?

1337
01:26:35,694 --> 01:26:37,615
The Morphin' grid is open!

1338
01:26:38,639 --> 01:26:39,759
What's going on?

1339
01:26:49,794 --> 01:26:50,879
Zordon?

1340
01:26:52,112 --> 01:26:53,126
Master?

1341
01:26:55,125 --> 01:26:56,010
Where is he?

1342
01:26:56,132 --> 01:26:57,722
He must have stepped
through the grid!

1343
01:26:58,348 --> 01:26:59,706
Alpha where did he go?

1344
01:26:59,863 --> 01:27:01,428
I don't know where he is.

1345
01:27:04,492 --> 01:27:05,492
Zordan, what?

1346
01:27:06,029 --> 01:27:08,837
Why didn't you step through?
That was your only chance.

1347
01:27:09,003 --> 01:27:10,130
I know.

1348
01:27:10,966 --> 01:27:13,467
But only one can come back.

1349
01:27:18,530 --> 01:27:19,530
Oh my God.

1350
01:27:19,860 --> 01:27:20,860
Billy!

1351
01:27:23,732 --> 01:27:25,363
- Billy!
- Oh my God.!

1352
01:27:28,259 --> 01:27:29,259
Are you okay?

1353
01:27:34,074 --> 01:27:35,074
You're not dead?

1354
01:27:35,153 --> 01:27:36,086
- Yeah.
- No.

1355
01:27:36,135 --> 01:27:37,135
A little bit.

1356
01:27:37,233 --> 01:27:38,701
You guys bring me back to life.

1357
01:27:40,192 --> 01:27:41,779
I told you we were superheroes.

1358
01:27:43,034 --> 01:27:46,176
There can only be one Red Ranger.

1359
01:27:46,672 --> 01:27:50,209
Jason, this is your time.

1360
01:27:50,555 --> 01:27:53,085
This is your team.

1361
01:27:53,554 --> 01:27:54,554
Thank you.

1362
01:27:56,868 --> 01:27:58,417
That was incredible

1363
01:27:59,408 --> 01:28:00,736
I've seen my dad.

1364
01:28:16,198 --> 01:28:17,824
Welcome back, my friend.

1365
01:28:19,937 --> 01:28:21,828
We gottta go to Krispy Kreme,
Jason.

1366
01:28:21,898 --> 01:28:22,438
What?

1367
01:28:22,637 --> 01:28:23,945
Not for doughnuts.

1368
01:28:25,765 --> 01:28:27,865
Okay. Let's try this.

1369
01:28:29,086 --> 01:28:30,334
Thank you, Zordon.

1370
01:28:52,047 --> 01:28:53,598
It's morphin' time.

1371
01:30:23,700 --> 01:30:26,553
Come back to me, Goldar.

1372
01:30:27,913 --> 01:30:29,687
Came back.

1373
01:30:42,298 --> 01:30:43,298
Hold up.

1374
01:30:43,550 --> 01:30:44,550
Look.

1375
01:30:55,554 --> 01:30:57,664
Alright, let's do this.

1376
01:31:34,535 --> 01:31:35,535
Yes!

1377
01:31:37,546 --> 01:31:39,479
This is so much better with armor.

1378
01:31:42,054 --> 01:31:43,054
Come on!

1379
01:31:43,151 --> 01:31:44,203
Pick it up!

1380
01:31:45,934 --> 01:31:47,388
Billy, heads up!

1381
01:31:57,242 --> 01:31:59,476
Guys. They just keep coming,

1382
01:31:59,782 --> 01:32:02,110
- There's too many of them.
- You guys hold them off.

1383
01:32:02,376 --> 01:32:03,799
Where are you going, Zack?

1384
01:32:07,511 --> 01:32:11,059
Make my monster grow.

1385
01:32:17,606 --> 01:32:20,158
I've missed you, my friend.

1386
01:32:24,588 --> 01:32:27,604
We're gonna push
themselves off the edge!

1387
01:32:35,945 --> 01:32:37,796
Let's kill everyone.

1388
01:32:41,074 --> 01:32:42,270
Yo, did you guys see that?

1389
01:32:43,696 --> 01:32:45,630
Alright,
who wants me to pimp there ride too?

1390
01:32:45,631 --> 01:32:46,911
At least you didn't crash, yeah?

1391
01:32:49,650 --> 01:32:50,839
Ah, guys?

1392
01:32:51,808 --> 01:32:52,911
We are too late.

1393
01:32:56,193 --> 01:32:57,280
Oh man!

1394
01:32:58,367 --> 01:32:59,461
That...

1395
01:33:00,013 --> 01:33:01,081
It's a lot of gold.

1396
01:33:01,680 --> 01:33:03,694
We're gonna protect the crystal,
right?

1397
01:33:05,214 --> 01:33:06,529
We're going to Angel Grove.

1398
01:33:06,693 --> 01:33:07,999
Let's get the zords.

1399
01:33:09,076 --> 01:33:11,155
This is a lot
different than the van.

1400
01:33:19,023 --> 01:33:20,661
Yippie-kay-yay, Motherfuck...

1401
01:33:21,222 --> 01:33:23,097
Mother is good, Mother's is good.

1402
01:33:23,218 --> 01:33:24,631
Go, go, Power Rangers!

1403
01:33:32,976 --> 01:33:36,097
I'm not going the right way. What?
Jason, I'm going backwards.

1404
01:33:40,325 --> 01:33:41,357
Guys!

1405
01:33:42,051 --> 01:33:43,051
Our town.

1406
01:33:43,648 --> 01:33:44,915
She's destroying it.

1407
01:33:52,091 --> 01:33:53,431
Not there.

1408
01:33:54,612 --> 01:33:57,190
Rita and her golden boy
haven't found Krispy Kreme yet.

1409
01:33:57,521 --> 01:33:58,981
Okay, Kim, you hold them there.

1410
01:33:59,211 --> 01:34:01,872
Zack, Billy, you circle the Krispy
Kreme and make sure it's safe.

1411
01:34:02,011 --> 01:34:04,490
- I am heading straight for Goldar.
- Oh, hold her up!

1412
01:34:05,312 --> 01:34:06,953
Kim, I'll go with you.

1413
01:34:07,391 --> 01:34:08,196
Let's go boys.

1414
01:34:08,371 --> 01:34:10,866
- Billy, just the two of us.
- I'm right behind you

1415
01:34:13,051 --> 01:34:14,051
oops!

1416
01:34:16,931 --> 01:34:17,985
Surprise.

1417
01:34:29,750 --> 01:34:31,064
How cute.

1418
01:34:31,489 --> 01:34:35,359
The Rangers found their costumes
and their dino cars.

1419
01:34:35,565 --> 01:34:38,208
Let's give them something
else to play with.

1420
01:34:49,239 --> 01:34:50,565
Crush them!

1421
01:34:54,919 --> 01:34:56,410
How many of this you need?

1422
01:34:56,658 --> 01:34:57,837
This is insane.

1423
01:35:00,648 --> 01:35:01,648
Take that!

1424
01:35:06,044 --> 01:35:08,062
Okay, let's try this.

1425
01:35:11,308 --> 01:35:12,908
I'm sorry, Bumblebee!

1426
01:35:13,919 --> 01:35:14,919
Yeah!

1427
01:35:22,839 --> 01:35:24,197
I can't get them off!

1428
01:35:24,338 --> 01:35:26,190
Turn your head! Trust me.

1429
01:35:29,608 --> 01:35:30,608
Okay!

1430
01:35:31,168 --> 01:35:32,168
Thanks, Kim.

1431
01:35:32,683 --> 01:35:33,732
Ta da.

1432
01:35:39,123 --> 01:35:40,493
That's what you get.

1433
01:35:58,638 --> 01:35:59,989
The crystal.

1434
01:36:02,830 --> 01:36:03,870
She just found the crystal.

1435
01:36:04,057 --> 01:36:05,945
Okay, come on let's move

1436
01:36:17,157 --> 01:36:19,138
I'll take Goldar from the right.

1437
01:36:19,315 --> 01:36:20,866
Jason! right behind you.

1438
01:36:21,036 --> 01:36:22,036
Come on!

1439
01:36:27,771 --> 01:36:28,865
Jason, It's your dad.

1440
01:36:29,035 --> 01:36:32,721
I'm looking for you. I'm downtown,
I'm at Mariner Bay and Reefside.

1441
01:36:32,835 --> 01:36:34,447
Call me back as soon
as you get this.

1442
01:36:36,364 --> 01:36:38,872
- How does that feel?
- We got this. Come on!

1443
01:36:40,685 --> 01:36:42,035
No!

1444
01:36:44,668 --> 01:36:45,676
I am coming.

1445
01:37:12,639 --> 01:37:13,639
Help me.

1446
01:37:37,683 --> 01:37:38,889
Give me your hand.

1447
01:37:40,504 --> 01:37:41,551
Sam!

1448
01:37:42,382 --> 01:37:43,382
Look at me.

1449
01:37:44,759 --> 01:37:45,808
It's okay.

1450
01:37:47,119 --> 01:37:48,590
Give me your hand.

1451
01:37:55,450 --> 01:37:56,513
Dig.

1452
01:37:57,372 --> 01:37:58,964
Dig, Goldar.

1453
01:38:00,570 --> 01:38:03,141
Me and Zack, we're gonna trying
to push Goldar to the water.

1454
01:38:14,220 --> 01:38:15,220
We are okay

1455
01:38:15,837 --> 01:38:18,013
I'm okay. Go.

1456
01:38:21,194 --> 01:38:22,453
Guys help!

1457
01:38:22,580 --> 01:38:23,857
Billy I have an idea.

1458
01:38:24,315 --> 01:38:25,315
Ready?

1459
01:38:25,467 --> 01:38:27,565
Yeah? For what exactly?

1460
01:38:38,588 --> 01:38:40,599
I don't know what to press, ok?

1461
01:38:45,220 --> 01:38:46,579
Open wide, Rita.

1462
01:38:47,113 --> 01:38:48,182
Let me try.

1463
01:39:21,166 --> 01:39:22,935
Hey Billy, you okay?

1464
01:39:23,264 --> 01:39:25,802
- Yeah I am okay.
- That was crazy brave, dude.

1465
01:39:26,243 --> 01:39:27,243
Did we do it?

1466
01:39:27,751 --> 01:39:29,171
We, Did we win?

1467
01:39:29,713 --> 01:39:30,944
Yeah!

1468
01:40:00,508 --> 01:40:02,208
I feel the crystal.

1469
01:40:04,482 --> 01:40:05,482
She is back.

1470
01:40:21,223 --> 01:40:22,399
It's incredible.

1471
01:40:23,085 --> 01:40:24,322
Oh My God.

1472
01:40:25,876 --> 01:40:26,987
Come on! let's go.

1473
01:40:32,702 --> 01:40:34,056
Okay, everyone..

1474
01:40:36,442 --> 01:40:37,649
Hold the line!

1475
01:40:50,330 --> 01:40:51,330
Okay,

1476
01:40:52,382 --> 01:40:53,410
We got this.

1477
01:40:54,094 --> 01:40:55,094
Come on!

1478
01:40:57,592 --> 01:40:59,274
Crush them!

1479
01:40:59,470 --> 01:41:00,634
'kay fire!

1480
01:41:06,596 --> 01:41:07,627
Yes!

1481
01:41:09,159 --> 01:41:10,463
Come on guys!

1482
01:41:21,339 --> 01:41:22,676
If you want to come at me...

1483
01:41:24,153 --> 01:41:25,342
Come at me, bro!

1484
01:41:25,582 --> 01:41:26,874
Watch out! Billy!

1485
01:41:35,105 --> 01:41:37,318
Yeah!

1486
01:41:39,950 --> 01:41:41,750
Jason, I'm coming in.

1487
01:41:42,294 --> 01:41:43,690
Kim, I got your back.

1488
01:41:47,683 --> 01:41:48,683
I got you.

1489
01:41:59,898 --> 01:42:00,986
I'm burning.

1490
01:42:03,099 --> 01:42:05,041
I can't breathe.

1491
01:42:14,549 --> 01:42:15,616
It's crushing me.

1492
01:42:16,828 --> 01:42:18,805
Push them into the pit!

1493
01:42:20,618 --> 01:42:22,035
Guys we're sliding.

1494
01:42:22,196 --> 01:42:23,956
Come on, everybody, hold the line!

1495
01:42:24,260 --> 01:42:25,512
Fight back!

1496
01:42:29,754 --> 01:42:31,206
It's getting too hot guys.

1497
01:42:31,207 --> 01:42:32,887
I don't know how much
longer I can hold it.

1498
01:42:36,394 --> 01:42:37,834
No one dies alone.

1499
01:42:38,117 --> 01:42:39,373
I'm okay with it.

1500
01:42:51,301 --> 01:42:52,301
Hold on.

1501
01:42:52,955 --> 01:42:53,964
Hold on.

1502
01:42:55,156 --> 01:42:56,156
Hold on.

1503
01:42:56,192 --> 01:42:58,455
Zack! Stay with me, Zack! Come on.

1504
01:43:14,589 --> 01:43:16,331
Thank you for being my friends.

1505
01:43:20,019 --> 01:43:21,473
Hold on to each other.

1506
01:43:40,711 --> 01:43:42,667
Get my crystal!

1507
01:44:24,353 --> 01:44:25,609
We are alive.

1508
01:44:26,767 --> 01:44:28,912
Guys! We are alive!

1509
01:44:29,107 --> 01:44:30,998
We are like one big
uh..one big Zord.

1510
01:44:31,068 --> 01:44:32,066
Like A momma Zord.

1511
01:44:32,287 --> 01:44:34,156
- Or just..?
- No, that sounds lame.

1512
01:44:34,888 --> 01:44:36,348
A Megazord!

1513
01:44:39,965 --> 01:44:41,417
How?

1514
01:45:01,616 --> 01:45:02,616
Whoa!

1515
01:45:12,913 --> 01:45:13,913
What?

1516
01:45:20,362 --> 01:45:21,515
Shit.

1517
01:45:22,965 --> 01:45:23,981
Bring it on!

1518
01:45:24,328 --> 01:45:25,648
Everyone let's go!

1519
01:45:35,750 --> 01:45:37,634
No, no. No, no No, no!

1520
01:45:38,984 --> 01:45:40,767
It might have been my fault.
I'm sorry y'all.

1521
01:45:40,768 --> 01:45:42,175
I think Kimberly
needs to move our feet.

1522
01:45:42,245 --> 01:45:42,533
No.

1523
01:45:42,733 --> 01:45:45,065
- No, I have got the arm.
- No, I do. I got the leg.

1524
01:45:45,144 --> 01:45:47,286
- You got a leg too?
- I have the arm.

1525
01:45:47,463 --> 01:45:49,642
- We all have to move together.
- I'll lift us.

1526
01:45:53,244 --> 01:45:54,874
All together up in three.

1527
01:45:55,137 --> 01:45:56,583
One two...

1528
01:45:57,183 --> 01:45:58,183
three.

1529
01:45:59,004 --> 01:46:00,504
We got this! Come on!

1530
01:46:03,548 --> 01:46:04,833
Zack, catch us.

1531
01:46:10,870 --> 01:46:11,968
Let's go again.

1532
01:46:13,555 --> 01:46:15,537
Kimberly! Throw a hook, Now!

1533
01:46:23,358 --> 01:46:24,807
Oh, I wish I could punch.

1534
01:46:29,380 --> 01:46:30,494
Nice one, Billy!

1535
01:46:37,734 --> 01:46:40,563
Jason? We got anything for that?

1536
01:46:40,786 --> 01:46:42,262
Remember the pit?

1537
01:46:42,975 --> 01:46:43,975
Yeah.

1538
01:46:44,117 --> 01:46:45,513
I hiked the pit!

1539
01:46:49,207 --> 01:46:50,062
Ready?

1540
01:46:50,160 --> 01:46:51,699
Ready.

1541
01:46:51,862 --> 01:46:52,615
Ready.

1542
01:46:52,833 --> 01:46:53,833
Ready..

1543
01:46:55,065 --> 01:46:56,065
Now!

1544
01:46:57,846 --> 01:46:58,846
Slip!

1545
01:47:01,661 --> 01:47:02,661
Grab!

1546
01:47:03,961 --> 01:47:04,961
Lift!

1547
01:47:14,256 --> 01:47:16,917
Kim, Trini, pull back on the arms.

1548
01:47:17,283 --> 01:47:18,609
It's got swords.

1549
01:47:33,289 --> 01:47:35,350
Wait!

1550
01:47:36,890 --> 01:47:37,890
Guys!

1551
01:47:39,114 --> 01:47:40,114
Wait.

1552
01:47:42,285 --> 01:47:43,362
Look at me.

1553
01:47:45,720 --> 01:47:48,084
You think you've won?

1554
01:47:49,489 --> 01:47:51,160
I came for the crystal.

1555
01:47:51,975 --> 01:47:53,848
Others will come!

1556
01:47:54,732 --> 01:47:56,325
What you have...

1557
01:47:57,357 --> 01:47:59,158
It can't last.

1558
01:48:00,764 --> 01:48:02,609
You know I'm right!

1559
01:48:03,004 --> 01:48:04,004
No.

1560
01:48:04,332 --> 01:48:05,332
No.

1561
01:48:05,818 --> 01:48:08,240
I don't know, but for now...

1562
01:48:08,499 --> 01:48:11,607
I need you to give your staff
and your coin to us.

1563
01:48:11,757 --> 01:48:14,758
And we'll take you to Zordon
and let him be the judge.

1564
01:48:14,897 --> 01:48:16,271
Zordon?

1565
01:48:17,446 --> 01:48:18,957
Judge me?

1566
01:48:21,138 --> 01:48:22,599
Never!

1567
01:48:23,908 --> 01:48:26,515
No matter what Zordon says...

1568
01:48:26,730 --> 01:48:30,659
I know I am worthy!

1569
01:48:33,556 --> 01:48:34,897
Trini! Now!

1570
01:48:50,661 --> 01:48:51,661
Jason?

1571
01:48:52,059 --> 01:48:53,457
Did you just slap her?

1572
01:48:53,627 --> 01:48:54,656
I did.

1573
01:48:55,054 --> 01:48:56,277
Weird right?

1574
01:48:58,686 --> 01:48:59,688
That's cool.

1575
01:49:00,156 --> 01:49:01,203
It's the bull...

1576
01:49:01,433 --> 01:49:03,490
You guys don't get it.
Is the bull...

1577
01:49:03,837 --> 01:49:04,916
I got it, buddy

1578
01:49:06,672 --> 01:49:07,857
I was scared.

1579
01:49:14,139 --> 01:49:15,139
We did it.

1580
01:49:34,461 --> 01:49:36,243
I told you we'd be famous.

1581
01:49:36,633 --> 01:49:40,238
Is that Principal?
Hey.

1582
01:49:40,438 --> 01:49:42,191
I don't think he can see me.

1583
01:50:03,709 --> 01:50:05,254
Nice willow, Jason.

1584
01:50:06,750 --> 01:50:08,473
I call this the algebra.

1585
01:50:09,205 --> 01:50:10,931
How do you do that?

1586
01:50:17,443 --> 01:50:18,995
You should keep that.

1587
01:50:21,188 --> 01:50:22,304
You've earned it.

1588
01:50:23,743 --> 01:50:25,072
I'll come back for her.

1589
01:50:25,236 --> 01:50:28,264
That was terrifying. See you buddy.

1590
01:50:42,243 --> 01:50:44,348
Jeremy Franklin told
everyone at school.

1591
01:50:44,637 --> 01:50:46,566
Blue is the best one,
It's what I wanna be.

1592
01:50:46,744 --> 01:50:49,171
- No! I want to be the Blue one!
- I want the Blue one.

1593
01:50:49,364 --> 01:50:51,673
How about when you guys
can be the yellow one?

1594
01:50:52,552 --> 01:50:55,412
Oh yeah, the yellow one,
he is so cool!

1595
01:50:56,357 --> 01:50:57,912
How do you know it's a he?

1596
01:51:20,760 --> 01:51:22,114
Check mate.

1597
01:51:29,135 --> 01:51:32,927
<i>Billy! Jason Scott is here,
