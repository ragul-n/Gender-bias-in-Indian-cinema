1
00:02:12,482 --> 00:02:13,959
Today's day....

2
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:17,001
......its a very big day for all of us....

3
00:02:17,001 --> 00:02:18,074
....and also should be proud on this day!

4
00:02:18,074 --> 00:02:20,822
Before 25 years.....

5
00:02:20,822 --> 00:02:23,301
......Late Sanjeevlalji.......

6
00:02:23,301 --> 00:02:25,741
....had done the opening of this mill!

7
00:02:25,741 --> 00:02:27,539
Since then...

8
00:02:27,539 --> 00:02:29,238
...our mill...

9
00:02:29,238 --> 00:02:32,351
....is progressing day by day!

10
00:02:32,351 --> 00:02:34,201
Today's meet....

11
00:02:34,201 --> 00:02:39,781
...is called for celebrating our silver jubilee!

12
00:02:39,781 --> 00:02:41,608
On this happy occasion....

13
00:02:41,608 --> 00:02:44,593
....I want to give you a piece of good news!

14
00:02:44,593 --> 00:02:47,352
Sir Sanjeevlal's son.....

15
00:02:47,352 --> 00:02:48,969
.....Sir Rajeevlal....

16
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:51,773
.....is taking the entire responsibility....

17
00:02:51,773 --> 00:02:53,831
.....of this mill.

18
00:02:53,831 --> 00:03:06,455
He is our new boss!

19
00:03:06,455 --> 00:03:10,077
My fellow workers...!

20
00:03:10,077 --> 00:03:14,165
In todays world, there is nothing like a boss and an employee!

21
00:03:14,165 --> 00:03:16,421
These days’ servants are treated as bosses...

22
00:03:16,421 --> 00:03:18,806
.....and bosses are treated like servants!

23
00:03:18,806 --> 00:03:21,136
This is the time of workers!

24
00:03:21,136 --> 00:03:23,141
Its your time!

25
00:03:23,141 --> 00:03:24,407
Sir!

26
00:03:24,407 --> 00:03:25,811
What are you saying?

27
00:03:25,811 --> 00:03:26,859
If today your father would have been alive....

28
00:03:26,859 --> 00:03:29,003
.....these people would have abused him!

29
00:03:29,003 --> 00:03:31,248
So I was saying.....

30
00:03:31,248 --> 00:03:35,114
....my father had started this factory with
6 lakh rupees in hand!

31
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:36,211
In these 25 years.....

32
00:03:36,211 --> 00:03:38,223
....more than a crore.....

33
00:03:38,223 --> 00:03:41,286
.....we have crossed excessive profits!

34
00:03:41,286 --> 00:03:44,451
I am talking mother!
Why are you taking pains!

35
00:03:44,451 --> 00:03:46,363
Ladies and gentlemen!

36
00:03:46,363 --> 00:03:49,488
Being happy with your honesty and hard work....

37
00:03:49,488 --> 00:03:52,838
.....my mother has decided to gift you worth 5 lakh rupees!

38
00:03:52,838 --> 00:03:53,525
Rajeev!

39
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:55,069
You just say a yes!

40
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:57,944
Yes!

41
00:03:57,944 --> 00:04:00,364
Why did you say a yes?

42
00:04:00,364 --> 00:04:03,782
Because he announced the reward on my name so...

43
00:04:03,782 --> 00:04:04,597
...what else could I do?

44
00:04:04,597 --> 00:04:06,272
You could have left on me!

45
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:09,136
I would have told every, Rajeev overheard.

46
00:04:09,136 --> 00:04:12,615
It was not 5 lakhs it was 5000!

47
00:04:12,615 --> 00:04:16,777
Late Sanjeevlalji used to worship money after God!

48
00:04:16,777 --> 00:04:19,041
5 lakh rupees will go in vain....

49
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:22,198
....and this would really hurt him.

50
00:04:22,198 --> 00:04:25,236
I will pray for his soul!

51
00:04:25,236 --> 00:04:27,434
If Rajeev keeps donating in this manner....

52
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:29,876
....you will have to pray everyday!

53
00:04:29,876 --> 00:04:32,514
We had to face losses right after taking
the responsibility in hand

54
00:04:32,514 --> 00:04:34,336
If you extract a pot full of water from the sea....

55
00:04:34,336 --> 00:04:36,997
.....it doesnt make a big difference!

56
00:04:36,997 --> 00:04:38,366
He is a wealthy person!

57
00:04:38,366 --> 00:04:40,567
If Raju donated 5 lakh rupees....

58
00:04:40,567 --> 00:04:42,177
...so what happened?

59
00:04:42,177 --> 00:04:45,024
Mother, Karuna has brainwashed Rajeev from childhood!

60
00:04:45,024 --> 00:04:47,307
And I have even nourished him!

61
00:04:47,307 --> 00:04:49,701
I dont want to answer this maid.

62
00:04:49,701 --> 00:04:52,797
Shaamlalji, Karuna was never addressed like a maid!

63
00:04:52,797 --> 00:04:54,622
When did I say so?

64
00:04:54,622 --> 00:04:56,707
I am your manager since 30 years!

65
00:04:56,707 --> 00:04:58,411
Its my duty to see take care of the money!

66
00:04:58,411 --> 00:05:01,022
Rajeev is the boss!

67
00:05:01,022 --> 00:05:03,167
He can donate the entire wealth!

68
00:05:03,167 --> 00:05:04,904
What are you saying, Shaamlalji!

69
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:06,584
What will he say, Ranima!

70
00:05:06,584 --> 00:05:08,638
Its an arbitrary age!

71
00:05:08,638 --> 00:05:10,732
He will get married and will have children....

72
00:05:10,732 --> 00:05:14,198
....after the responsibilities he'll stop behaving adolescent!

73
00:05:14,198 --> 00:05:17,594
Dont listen to him.

74
00:05:17,594 --> 00:05:18,578
You are right!

75
00:05:18,578 --> 00:05:21,139
This meant I was talking nonsense?
No!

76
00:05:21,139 --> 00:05:22,509
You did not understand, Shaamlalji!

77
00:05:22,509 --> 00:05:24,741
I was thinking about his wedding!

78
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:28,601
In next 7 days I will get him married!

79
00:05:28,601 --> 00:05:29,677
So soon?

80
00:05:29,677 --> 00:05:32,493
But Ranima, we'll take time finding a girl.

81
00:05:32,493 --> 00:05:34,937
What is not possible if we dont try, Shaamlalji?

82
00:05:34,937 --> 00:05:38,856
You call some girls from good families; I will select the best one!

83
00:05:38,856 --> 00:05:40,786
But Raju has to get married.....

84
00:05:40,786 --> 00:05:42,199
....ask him first!

85
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:45,774
I will have to ask my son to get a daughter in law?

86
00:05:45,774 --> 00:05:47,124
Why do I do so?

87
00:05:47,124 --> 00:05:50,019
I will select a girl for him!

88
00:05:50,019 --> 00:05:51,505
Shaamlalji.....

89
00:05:51,505 --> 00:05:56,092
....you can go!
Yes!

90
00:05:56,092 --> 00:06:00,828
Welcome!

91
00:06:00,828 --> 00:06:03,159
She is Kala!

92
00:06:03,159 --> 00:06:05,994
Shaamlalji, I dont want a middle class girl!

93
00:06:05,994 --> 00:06:10,083
I am not as wealthy as you are but
even I have some class!

94
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:10,812
Shaamlalji....

95
00:06:10,812 --> 00:06:13,382
....he is her father!

96
00:06:13,382 --> 00:06:14,317
I understood!

97
00:06:14,317 --> 00:06:16,131
She wears such tight clothes..

98
00:06:16,131 --> 00:06:19,678
...I thought you couldnt afford decent clothes!
Mother!

99
00:06:19,678 --> 00:06:21,431
This is in vogue.

100
00:06:21,431 --> 00:06:22,593
I respect my father...

101
00:06:22,593 --> 00:06:25,452
....otherwise there are girls who even
wear tighter clothes than this!

102
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:26,548
Shaamlalji!

103
00:06:26,548 --> 00:06:29,186
I dont want a girl who calls me mummy!

104
00:06:29,186 --> 00:12:59,116
No problem!

105
00:06:29,093 --> 00:06:35,116
See next!

106
00:06:35,116 --> 00:06:36,253
Greetings!

107
00:06:36,253 --> 00:06:39,271
How do I praise my own daughter with my own mouth?

108
00:06:39,271 --> 00:06:43,152
She doesnt wear anything besides 'Khadi'.

109
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:44,369
Do you worship everyday?

110
00:06:44,369 --> 00:06:45,533
Worshipping?

111
00:06:45,533 --> 00:06:49,313
Every morning, she reads 'the Ramayana' for 3 hours....

112
00:06:49,313 --> 00:06:51,055
....and in the evening she reads Mahabharata for 3 hours!

113
00:06:51,055 --> 00:06:55,057
She must be singing devotional songs in the afternoon!

114
00:06:55,057 --> 00:06:59,146
Go ahead

115
00:06:59,146 --> 00:07:00,753
I like your daughter!

116
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,215
Touch her feet.

117
00:07:02,215 --> 00:07:03,672
Live long

118
00:07:03,672 --> 00:07:09,862
My son has arrived!

119
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:29,831
Come here Raju!

120
00:07:29,831 --> 00:07:32,491
What happen to your leg?

121
00:07:32,491 --> 00:07:36,222
He is limping!

122
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:40,552
Rajeev!

123
00:07:40,552 --> 00:07:43,717
He is deaf?

124
00:07:43,717 --> 00:07:45,988
Rajeev why are you misbehaving?

125
00:07:45,988 --> 00:07:47,898
I dont want to ruin my daughter's life!

126
00:07:47,898 --> 00:07:54,319
Come on!

127
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:59,341
You talk like your son deserved!

128
00:07:59,341 --> 00:08:05,058
Look how good is your son.

129
00:08:05,058 --> 00:08:07,243
Come on.

130
00:08:07,243 --> 00:08:20,742
Why are we sitting?

131
00:08:20,742 --> 00:08:21,863
Why did you behave in this manner?

132
00:08:21,863 --> 00:08:24,639
When you know I dont want to get married!

133
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,169
You wont marry?

134
00:08:26,169 --> 00:08:27,277
No!

135
00:08:27,277 --> 00:08:29,756
But I have chosen a girl for you!

136
00:08:29,756 --> 00:08:31,185
Its surprising mother...

137
00:08:31,185 --> 00:08:34,109
......I have to get married and you'll select?

138
00:08:34,109 --> 00:08:35,263
Rajeev!

139
00:08:35,263 --> 00:08:37,333
You will get married in a reputed family!

140
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:39,647
Even you are from a wealthy family.

141
00:08:39,647 --> 00:08:42,531
Is it necessary for me to get married in a wealthy family?

142
00:08:42,531 --> 00:08:45,677
I will get married to a girl of my choice.

143
00:08:45,677 --> 00:08:47,464
What is your choice?

144
00:08:47,464 --> 00:08:48,079
Even I want to know!

145
00:08:48,079 --> 00:08:52,101
I have never seen such a girl!

146
00:08:52,101 --> 00:08:56,491
But I have her picture in my mind!

147
00:08:56,491 --> 00:08:58,051
Naive,

148
00:08:58,051 --> 00:08:59,661
Innocent,

149
00:08:59,661 --> 00:09:02,102
Humble,

150
00:09:02,102 --> 00:09:03,463
Sweet-looking,

151
00:09:03,463 --> 00:09:07,186
I hate all these modern girls!

152
00:09:07,186 --> 00:09:09,685
You will have to get married to the girl of my choice.

153
00:09:09,685 --> 00:09:12,151
I ruin my life because of your stubborn behavior?

154
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:14,048
Marriage is a question of entire life!

155
00:09:14,048 --> 00:09:19,411
Its not a playful act.

156
00:09:19,411 --> 00:09:20,842
He will have to get married.

157
00:09:20,842 --> 00:09:28,133
That too my choice!

158
00:09:28,133 --> 00:09:29,433
Hello!

159
00:09:29,433 --> 00:09:30,731
Why are you shouting?

160
00:09:30,731 --> 00:09:33,148
I am Chandar!

161
00:09:33,148 --> 00:09:35,075
From the club.

162
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:38,155
I am waiting for you, here.

163
00:09:38,155 --> 00:09:40,051
You are drunk!

164
00:09:40,051 --> 00:09:42,982
I have never even tasted!

165
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:45,199
Is it?

166
00:09:45,199 --> 00:09:49,272
Taste then.

167
00:09:49,272 --> 00:09:50,537
Do you have permission?

168
00:09:50,537 --> 00:10:04,639
No!

169
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:07,252
Waiter quickly give me a coke!

170
00:10:07,252 --> 00:10:08,686
Do you why I drink?

171
00:10:08,686 --> 00:10:30,107
Yes, who doesnt know what have you gone through!

172
00:10:30,107 --> 00:10:32,961
Its not my habit nor do I need it!

173
00:10:32,961 --> 00:10:35,082
But I need it!

174
00:10:35,082 --> 00:10:36,946
He is very boring!

175
00:10:36,946 --> 00:10:38,554
We will sit here.

176
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:40,738
Your coke.

177
00:10:40,738 --> 00:10:42,287
I'll give some good news.

178
00:10:42,287 --> 00:10:44,887
People used to call me your flunkeys!

179
00:10:44,887 --> 00:10:46,649
But now I am insurance agent!

180
00:10:46,649 --> 00:10:47,143
What?

181
00:10:47,143 --> 00:10:49,214
Insurance agent.

182
00:10:49,214 --> 00:10:49,909
First thing......

183
00:10:49,909 --> 00:10:52,809
...I will get you insured...

184
00:10:52,809 --> 00:10:55,687
My mother is getting me insured!

185
00:10:55,687 --> 00:10:56,576
What?

186
00:10:56,576 --> 00:10:57,896
An agent reached at your place before me?

187
00:10:57,896 --> 00:10:58,998
Shut up.

188
00:10:58,998 --> 00:11:00,596
Boy!

189
00:11:00,596 --> 00:11:03,179
Colonel I was not telling you.

190
00:11:03,179 --> 00:11:06,844
Chandar, my mother wants me to get married!

191
00:11:06,844 --> 00:11:07,836
Thank you, Thank you!
Shut up!

192
00:11:07,836 --> 00:11:09,997
I am very upset!

193
00:11:09,997 --> 00:11:13,054
My mother had invited many girls today!

194
00:11:13,054 --> 00:11:13,918
How were they?

195
00:11:13,918 --> 00:11:16,402
Rubbish all were bad!
I banished them all!

196
00:11:16,402 --> 00:11:18,615
I dont get even one, and you banished them!

197
00:11:18,615 --> 00:11:23,005
Chandar, dont joke around it is a very serious thing!

198
00:11:23,005 --> 00:11:24,772
Why dont you find a girl of your choice?

199
00:11:24,772 --> 00:11:26,904
I haven’t ever liked any girl!

200
00:11:26,904 --> 00:11:28,073
Search for one!

201
00:11:28,073 --> 00:11:38,056
You will have to get married someday!

202
00:11:38,056 --> 00:11:40,658
Look, I dont want to get married!

203
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:45,747
Tell me how to escape from here!

204
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:48,084
Even Kamala had escaped.

205
00:11:48,084 --> 00:11:50,461
Even you run away!

206
00:11:50,461 --> 00:11:51,676
What?

207
00:11:51,676 --> 00:11:53,321
He is right

208
00:11:53,321 --> 00:11:54,892
Where will I go?

209
00:11:54,892 --> 00:11:56,814
Go to Kashmir!

210
00:11:56,814 --> 00:11:57,891
You have your house there!

211
00:11:57,891 --> 00:11:59,606
Bholaraam works under you.

212
00:11:59,606 --> 00:12:01,478
And Ranima never goes there.

213
00:12:01,478 --> 00:12:02,126
Right!

214
00:12:02,126 --> 00:12:04,273
You are right!
You come along!

215
00:12:04,273 --> 00:12:04,672
No!

216
00:12:04,672 --> 00:12:05,733
Its the question of my job.

217
00:12:05,733 --> 00:12:07,777
Resign!

218
00:12:07,777 --> 00:12:09,382
I shouldnt work being you friend!

219
00:12:09,382 --> 00:12:10,744
What a shame on me!
Correct.

220
00:12:10,744 --> 00:12:13,787
But I'll take 2 days to resign.

221
00:12:13,787 --> 00:12:16,155
You take my car and leave I'll join you later!

222
00:12:16,155 --> 00:12:16,764
Promise?

223
00:12:16,764 --> 00:14:08,487
Promise!

224
00:14:08,487 --> 00:14:12,476
"At some point of time..."

225
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:20,835
"....somewhere, I will have to love someone"

226
00:14:20,835 --> 00:14:24,976
"At some point of time..."

227
00:14:24,976 --> 00:14:46,529
"....somewhere, I will have to love someone"

228
00:14:46,529 --> 00:14:52,748
"There are many beautiful faces...."

229
00:14:52,748 --> 00:14:57,429
"...I am confused between whom to select"

230
00:14:57,429 --> 00:15:01,597
"Who is mine?"

231
00:15:01,597 --> 00:15:05,536
"Who will stay with me forever?"

232
00:15:05,536 --> 00:15:10,053
"Cheerful and happy"

233
00:15:10,053 --> 00:15:14,233
"Cheerful, happy and fun loving"

234
00:15:14,233 --> 00:15:18,518
"She will come in life today"

235
00:15:18,518 --> 00:15:22,706
"At some point of time..."

236
00:15:22,706 --> 00:15:31,087
"....somewhere, I will have to love someone"

237
00:15:31,087 --> 00:15:35,238
"At some point of time..."

238
00:15:35,238 --> 00:15:56,395
"....somewhere, I will have to love someone"

239
00:15:56,395 --> 00:16:01,493
"I am searching for a world...."

240
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:05,005
".....that is called love"

241
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:09,434
"I am searching for a world...."

242
00:16:09,434 --> 00:16:13,633
".....that is called love"

243
00:16:13,633 --> 00:16:17,932
"Who are those lucky people...."

244
00:16:17,932 --> 00:16:21,083
"....who stay in this world?"

245
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:26,228
"I will go there"

246
00:16:26,228 --> 00:16:30,026
"I will go there"

247
00:16:30,026 --> 00:16:34,877
"I will meet my dream girl"

248
00:16:34,877 --> 00:16:38,739
"At some point of time..."

249
00:16:38,739 --> 00:16:47,154
"....somewhere, I will have to love someone"

250
00:16:47,154 --> 00:16:50,985
"At some point of time..."

251
00:16:50,985 --> 00:17:12,384
"....somewhere, I will have to love someone"

252
00:17:12,384 --> 00:17:18,663
"She should be tender..."

253
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:22,881
"....just like dew"

254
00:17:22,881 --> 00:17:26,576
"Her face looks like moon......"

255
00:17:26,576 --> 00:17:31,222
".....when she sleeps in the night"

256
00:17:31,222 --> 00:17:33,384
"Intoxicated eyes"

257
00:17:33,384 --> 00:17:35,632
"Rosy cheeks"

258
00:17:35,632 --> 00:17:44,043
"Intoxicated eyes, rozy cheeks"

259
00:17:44,043 --> 00:17:47,905
"At some point of time..."

260
00:17:47,905 --> 00:17:56,372
"....somewhere, I will have to love someone"

261
00:17:56,372 --> 00:18:01,627
"At some point of time..."

262
00:18:01,627 --> 00:18:17,791
"....somewhere, I will have to love someone"

263
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:19,839
Greetings!

264
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:23,378
Serve tea to all the girls

265
00:18:23,378 --> 00:18:25,162
Where are they coming from?

266
00:18:25,162 --> 00:18:26,758
From Pathanpur!

267
00:18:26,758 --> 00:18:28,477
They are Champa's friends!

268
00:18:28,477 --> 00:18:30,657
They come every year to the fair!

269
00:18:30,657 --> 00:18:31,719
Every year they come?

270
00:18:31,719 --> 00:18:34,769
Why not?
This is a very beautiful place!

271
00:18:34,769 --> 00:18:37,085
I have left Kulu 10 years ago!

272
00:18:37,085 --> 00:18:39,362
But they look like they are Kashmiris!

273
00:18:39,362 --> 00:18:41,192
Their choice!

274
00:18:41,192 --> 00:18:43,891
Till the time they stay in Kashmir they
wear the Kashmiri outfit!

275
00:18:43,891 --> 00:18:44,948
Now stop talking nonsense!

276
00:18:44,948 --> 00:18:46,987
Serve them hot tea.

277
00:18:46,987 --> 00:18:48,056
I have to go to Srinagar.

278
00:18:48,056 --> 00:18:50,932
How will you get there?
Why?

279
00:18:50,932 --> 00:18:53,324
The wooden bridge is broken!

280
00:18:53,324 --> 00:18:54,541
How is that possible?

281
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:56,936
It was completely fine in the morning.

282
00:18:56,936 --> 00:18:59,198
In the afternoon, it rained heavily and the cyclone....

283
00:18:59,198 --> 00:19:00,702
......shattered it completely!

284
00:19:00,702 --> 00:19:03,375
That way wont open before morning!

285
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,712
I will have to stay here in the night.

286
00:19:05,712 --> 00:19:06,526
Are there empty rooms available?

287
00:19:06,526 --> 00:19:08,658
You sleep in my room!

288
00:19:08,658 --> 00:19:13,246
What are you all laughing for?
Have your tea and get up!

289
00:19:13,246 --> 00:19:28,105
Anybody there?

290
00:19:28,105 --> 00:19:29,755
Who is the owner of this lodge?

291
00:19:29,755 --> 00:19:31,387
I am the one.

292
00:19:31,387 --> 00:19:34,016
Any room is empty?

293
00:19:34,016 --> 00:19:35,007
No!

294
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,704
What?

295
00:19:36,704 --> 00:19:39,592
There were 2 empty rooms and now they are occupied.

296
00:19:39,592 --> 00:19:40,805
Please help me!

297
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:42,843
I want to go to Srinagar and the roads are blocked!

298
00:19:42,843 --> 00:19:44,337
Where will I go at this time?

299
00:19:44,337 --> 00:19:52,103
Give me 3 rupees!

300
00:19:52,103 --> 00:19:55,015
Go and sleep below that staircase!

301
00:19:55,015 --> 00:19:56,761
In this chilling weather?

302
00:19:56,761 --> 00:19:59,144
I cant do anything more for you.

303
00:19:59,144 --> 00:20:00,435
Listen...

304
00:20:00,435 --> 00:20:03,031
...atleast arrange for a fireplace!

305
00:20:03,031 --> 00:20:04,133
Ok!

306
00:20:04,133 --> 00:20:08,068
Give me 2 rupees!

307
00:20:08,068 --> 00:20:09,944
Go!

308
00:20:09,944 --> 00:20:30,471
Come!

309
00:20:30,471 --> 00:20:31,787
Where is it burning?

310
00:20:31,787 --> 00:20:48,706
Just look!
Pour water!

311
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:49,333
What is this?

312
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:50,657
Why did you pour water?

313
00:20:50,657 --> 00:20:53,675
Sorry by mistake, we thought fire has erupted somewhere!

314
00:20:53,675 --> 00:20:55,281
Atleast see first.

315
00:20:55,281 --> 00:20:57,809
How would we see when there was only smoke!

316
00:20:57,809 --> 00:21:00,421
Why did you fire?

317
00:21:00,421 --> 00:21:01,754
What happen?

318
00:21:01,754 --> 00:21:03,252
They poured water from top.

319
00:21:03,252 --> 00:21:05,611
What did you except them to shower flowers?

320
00:21:05,611 --> 00:21:07,021
Definitely, he must have done something!

321
00:21:07,021 --> 00:21:09,763
I gave him place thinking he is a decent man.

322
00:21:09,763 --> 00:21:13,092
I was setting fire and was making my bed!

323
00:21:13,092 --> 00:21:15,265
What did we know?

324
00:21:15,265 --> 00:21:17,299
We saw smoke and felt something’s burning.

325
00:21:17,299 --> 00:21:19,808
You have become cold!

326
00:21:19,808 --> 00:21:28,026
Everyone sleep now!

327
00:21:28,026 --> 00:21:39,308
Rajeev, you will die of cold!

328
00:21:39,308 --> 00:21:41,438
Kashmir!

329
00:21:41,438 --> 00:21:45,026
I have to go to Srinagar!

330
00:21:45,026 --> 00:22:55,783
Its very cold!

331
00:22:55,783 --> 00:22:57,835
You?

332
00:22:57,835 --> 00:23:01,435
You had poured water!

333
00:23:01,435 --> 00:23:02,123
Weird girl...

334
00:23:02,123 --> 00:23:04,702
You first pour water then give me a blanket!

335
00:23:04,702 --> 00:25:09,576
What is your name?

336
00:25:09,576 --> 00:25:11,034
Recognized me?

337
00:25:11,034 --> 00:25:12,252
You?

338
00:25:12,252 --> 00:25:14,108
I heard your voice and came here!

339
00:25:14,108 --> 00:25:15,962
And I even met you.

340
00:25:15,962 --> 00:25:17,078
Elsewhere would I find you?

341
00:25:17,078 --> 00:25:19,274
Why?

342
00:25:19,274 --> 00:25:26,236
I wanted to thank you in the night
because you ran away!

343
00:25:26,236 --> 00:25:26,726
Seriously.

344
00:25:26,726 --> 00:25:28,232
If you wouldnt have helped me.....

345
00:25:28,232 --> 00:25:31,574
.....I would have frozen in cold!

346
00:25:31,574 --> 00:25:33,088
You left in the morning......

347
00:25:33,088 --> 00:25:34,409
.....I kept finding for you.

348
00:25:34,409 --> 00:25:35,859
Why?

349
00:25:35,859 --> 00:25:37,602
You forgot?
I have your belonging!

350
00:25:37,602 --> 00:25:38,943
What?

351
00:25:38,943 --> 00:25:41,709
Bucket!

352
00:25:41,709 --> 00:25:43,227
What nonsense!

353
00:25:43,227 --> 00:25:43,732
Correct!

354
00:25:43,732 --> 00:25:46,601
You seem to be old friends!

355
00:25:46,601 --> 00:25:51,012
We thought you both met last night for the first time!

356
00:25:51,012 --> 00:25:53,343
Shut up!

357
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:55,479
You people are shameless!

358
00:25:55,479 --> 00:26:00,188
No, we pick flowers!

359
00:26:00,188 --> 00:26:00,627
Listen!

360
00:26:00,627 --> 00:26:03,329
Even she picks flowers!

361
00:26:03,329 --> 00:26:06,626
Wait!

362
00:26:06,626 --> 00:26:09,915
Listen!

363
00:26:09,915 --> 00:26:12,114
Listen

364
00:26:12,114 --> 00:26:13,912
Wait!

365
00:26:13,912 --> 00:26:14,386
Listen!

366
00:26:14,386 --> 00:26:22,078
What is it?

367
00:26:22,078 --> 00:26:23,263
Your blanket!

368
00:26:23,263 --> 00:26:24,857
It doesn’t belong to me!

369
00:26:24,857 --> 00:26:27,298
It is from the lodge!

370
00:26:27,298 --> 00:26:28,404
What will I do with it?

371
00:26:28,404 --> 00:26:30,749
Throw it

372
00:26:30,749 --> 00:26:42,742
Throw it?

373
00:26:42,742 --> 00:26:45,378
Listen!

374
00:26:45,378 --> 00:26:46,855
This is the way to Srinagar?

375
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:47,918
Yes!

376
00:26:47,918 --> 00:26:51,159
You are going to Srinagar?

377
00:26:51,159 --> 00:26:51,985
Yes!

378
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:52,953
Sit in the car.

379
00:26:52,953 --> 00:26:55,243
I will drop you.

380
00:26:55,243 --> 00:26:56,088
I have a habit of walking.

381
00:26:56,088 --> 00:26:58,658
Nothing will change in one day!

382
00:26:58,658 --> 00:27:01,627
Last night you helped me today I will help you.

383
00:27:01,627 --> 00:27:04,256
I thought you are poor and so I helped you.

384
00:27:04,256 --> 00:27:06,818
I dint know you were rich!

385
00:27:06,818 --> 00:27:07,792
Really?

386
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:09,896
But how do you know I am rich?

387
00:27:09,896 --> 00:27:11,447
This car!

388
00:27:11,447 --> 00:27:12,596
It doesn’t belong to me.

389
00:27:12,596 --> 00:27:13,107
Then?

390
00:27:13,107 --> 00:27:15,357
You are a driver?

391
00:27:15,357 --> 00:27:16,274
Driver?

392
00:27:16,274 --> 00:27:19,339
You have dressed up like you are a rich man.

393
00:27:19,339 --> 00:27:22,281
Its my bosses’!

394
00:27:22,281 --> 00:27:24,251
I mean my Sir's!

395
00:27:24,251 --> 00:27:25,187
He is a very good man!

396
00:27:25,187 --> 00:27:26,804
This dress is also his!

397
00:27:26,804 --> 00:27:27,969
A gift!

398
00:27:27,969 --> 00:27:30,038
I misunderstood you!

399
00:27:30,038 --> 00:27:31,801
Everything is on a rent!

400
00:27:31,801 --> 00:27:33,215
What?

401
00:27:33,215 --> 00:27:36,089
Your car is rented and even your clothes!

402
00:27:36,089 --> 00:27:39,024
What is yours?

403
00:27:39,024 --> 00:27:42,007
Mine?

404
00:27:42,007 --> 00:27:44,406
1 heart!

405
00:27:44,406 --> 00:27:48,731
That is searching for someone!

406
00:27:48,731 --> 00:27:51,888
The one I like, I dont know her name.....

407
00:27:51,888 --> 00:27:54,394
....neither do I know her address!

408
00:27:54,394 --> 00:27:59,374
Atleast tell me your name!

409
00:27:59,374 --> 00:28:01,076
Whose name and address do you want to know, sir?

410
00:28:01,076 --> 00:28:03,242
Not your concern

411
00:28:03,242 --> 00:28:07,548
If you tease these innocent girls,
you will fall in a big problem!

412
00:28:07,548 --> 00:28:10,037
Please do your work!

413
00:28:10,037 --> 00:28:12,359
My work was to explain you...

414
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:13,715
.....and my name is Mohan!

415
00:28:13,715 --> 00:28:23,173
Do keep in mind!

416
00:28:23,173 --> 00:28:26,096
Come here, look.

417
00:28:26,096 --> 00:28:29,008
Hey Parshuram!
I am coming Sir Mohan!

418
00:28:29,008 --> 00:28:31,793
Everythings fine?
Yes sir!

419
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:32,346
Okay I am leaving then!

420
00:28:32,346 --> 00:28:34,045
Sir Mohan, lend me 10 rupees!

421
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:59,245
Again you need 10 rupees?
Its very necessary!

422
00:28:59,245 --> 00:29:02,555
Bholaraam!

423
00:29:02,555 --> 00:29:53,682
Hey Bholaraam!

424
00:29:53,682 --> 00:29:55,918
Who are you?

425
00:29:55,918 --> 00:29:56,485
Who are you?

426
00:29:56,485 --> 00:29:57,728
How did you come here?

427
00:29:57,728 --> 00:29:58,447
Leave this house!

428
00:29:58,447 --> 00:30:00,478
Shut up!

429
00:30:00,478 --> 00:30:02,686
Who asked you to enter the house?

430
00:30:02,686 --> 00:30:06,011
Hey Mr. we have given a rent of 3 months in advance!

431
00:30:06,011 --> 00:30:07,661
What rent?

432
00:30:07,661 --> 00:30:10,674
We have booked this hotel for the entire season!

433
00:30:10,674 --> 00:30:12,976
Is this a hotel?

434
00:30:12,976 --> 00:30:16,764
Then what is it?

435
00:30:16,764 --> 00:30:19,743
I will call the police!

436
00:30:19,743 --> 00:30:20,685
No!

437
00:30:20,685 --> 00:30:24,323
We will call the police!
Maya kindly call the police!

438
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:27,176
A scoundrel has forcibly entered our hotel.

439
00:30:27,176 --> 00:30:28,569
Hotel Lake View?
Yes!

440
00:30:28,569 --> 00:30:29,057
This is Hotel Lake View?

441
00:30:29,057 --> 00:30:32,696
Are you going or should I call the police?

442
00:30:32,696 --> 00:30:34,552
Have you heard Sir Rajeev's name?

443
00:30:34,552 --> 00:30:35,626
Yes!

444
00:30:35,626 --> 00:30:37,364
We have heard!

445
00:30:37,364 --> 00:30:40,207
I am the one.

446
00:30:40,207 --> 00:30:43,019
You are Raju?

447
00:30:43,019 --> 00:30:47,561
Girls!

448
00:30:47,561 --> 00:30:49,042
Girls you are back?

449
00:30:49,042 --> 00:30:51,002
Go and change your clothes!

450
00:30:51,002 --> 00:30:53,194
Who is he?

451
00:30:53,194 --> 00:30:56,388
He is Sir Rajeevlal!

452
00:30:56,388 --> 00:30:59,892
Sir Rajeevlal!

453
00:30:59,892 --> 00:31:01,017
Who said?

454
00:31:01,017 --> 00:31:02,614
He himself said so!

455
00:31:02,614 --> 00:31:04,516
He said and you all accepted?

456
00:31:04,516 --> 00:31:06,284
Yes!

457
00:31:06,284 --> 00:31:07,156
Silly girls.....

458
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:10,614
......Bholaraam wouldnt inform us if our sir
would be arriving?

459
00:31:10,614 --> 00:31:11,354
Where is Bholaraam?

460
00:31:11,354 --> 00:31:12,025
Where is he?

461
00:31:12,025 --> 00:31:12,755
I am asking!

462
00:31:12,755 --> 00:31:14,062
Who are you to ask me?

463
00:31:14,062 --> 00:31:16,527
You want to fool us?

464
00:31:16,527 --> 00:31:17,017
Leave from here!

465
00:31:17,017 --> 00:31:18,004
Who are you?

466
00:31:18,004 --> 00:31:19,088
Who are you?

467
00:31:19,088 --> 00:31:20,056
I am Ramadevi!

468
00:31:20,056 --> 00:31:22,239
I am her guardian!

469
00:31:22,239 --> 00:31:22,951
Understood?

470
00:31:22,951 --> 00:31:24,409
Ramadevi

471
00:31:24,409 --> 00:31:25,666
Keep your cool!

472
00:31:25,666 --> 00:31:26,514
After Bholaraam arrives....

473
00:31:26,514 --> 00:31:30,244
Before Bholaraam comes, you flee from here!

474
00:31:30,244 --> 00:31:30,877
Get out.

475
00:31:30,877 --> 00:31:33,734
Shut up!

476
00:31:33,734 --> 00:31:35,428
Girls, what are you looking at him?

477
00:31:35,428 --> 00:31:49,264
Whack him with your bats!

478
00:31:49,264 --> 00:31:51,123
Hey Bholaraam!
Sir, you?

479
00:31:51,123 --> 00:31:53,274
Who made a hotel here?

480
00:31:53,274 --> 00:31:54,329
Sir, I made!
Why?

481
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:56,318
Since many years you people had not visited this place.....

482
00:31:56,318 --> 00:31:58,301
....I used to feel lonely here!

483
00:31:58,301 --> 00:32:01,171
Shut up! I was insulted there!
Remove everyone from the bungalow!

484
00:32:01,171 --> 00:32:02,553
How is this possible Sir?

485
00:32:02,553 --> 00:32:04,408
I have taken an advance from them and
even given them a receipt.

486
00:32:04,408 --> 00:32:05,696
I dont know all that.

487
00:32:05,696 --> 00:32:07,593
Everyone should be out by evening!

488
00:32:07,593 --> 00:32:08,953
Till then I'll stay somewhere else!

489
00:32:08,953 --> 00:32:10,081
You cant stay here!

490
00:32:10,081 --> 00:32:11,737
What do you mean?

491
00:32:11,737 --> 00:32:13,296
Ranima has sent a telegram...

492
00:32:13,296 --> 00:32:16,087
.....saying if you have come here,
you have to immediately return back

493
00:32:16,087 --> 00:32:18,565
And what did you answer?

494
00:32:18,565 --> 00:32:21,184
I havent still given an answer, but I'll soon
reply back to her!

495
00:32:21,184 --> 00:32:23,853
Bholaraam nobody should know that I am here!

496
00:32:23,853 --> 00:32:24,588
But Sir...

497
00:32:24,588 --> 00:32:26,863
....I will have to reply back to her.

498
00:32:26,863 --> 00:32:28,626
Tell her I am not here.

499
00:32:28,626 --> 00:32:30,002
As you wish.

500
00:32:30,002 --> 00:32:31,281
But what about those girls?

501
00:32:31,281 --> 00:32:33,125
I cant remove them!

502
00:32:33,125 --> 00:32:35,311
Okay let them stay.

503
00:32:35,311 --> 00:32:36,894
I will stay somewhere else.

504
00:32:36,894 --> 00:32:38,243
What are you saying Sir?

505
00:32:38,243 --> 00:32:39,877
This Hotel belongs to you!

506
00:32:39,877 --> 00:32:43,589
I will empty the room on the top for you.

507
00:32:43,589 --> 00:32:47,506
But by mistake I told those girls I am Rajeevlal!

508
00:32:47,506 --> 00:32:48,855
So what?

509
00:32:48,855 --> 00:32:50,034
I will manage!

510
00:32:50,034 --> 00:32:50,896
How?

511
00:32:50,896 --> 00:32:52,346
Leave it on me!

512
00:32:52,346 --> 00:32:54,954
I will make up something!
You wait here for five minutes.......

513
00:32:54,954 --> 00:32:55,958
...I will be right back!

514
00:32:55,958 --> 00:32:57,394
Bholaraam....

515
00:32:57,394 --> 00:32:58,647
...you are simply the best!

516
00:32:58,647 --> 00:33:03,092
I serve you Sir!

517
00:33:03,092 --> 00:33:04,036
Welcome Sir!

518
00:33:04,036 --> 00:33:08,313
I have made all the arrangements
for you in the room on top!

519
00:33:08,313 --> 00:33:09,971
Where are they?

520
00:33:09,971 --> 00:33:11,067
They must be hiding somewhere around in fear!

521
00:33:11,067 --> 00:33:12,879
In fear, what do you mean?

522
00:33:12,879 --> 00:33:13,471
Means....

523
00:33:13,471 --> 00:33:15,367
...I have said something...

524
00:33:15,367 --> 00:33:17,593
....that has frightened them and they
wont dare to face you!

525
00:33:17,593 --> 00:33:36,843
Very good!

526
00:33:36,843 --> 00:33:38,209
Have they shifted from here?

527
00:33:38,209 --> 00:33:41,499
Look around Sir!

528
00:33:41,499 --> 00:33:47,392
I am seeing!

529
00:33:47,392 --> 00:33:50,546
He started with his madness!

530
00:33:50,546 --> 00:33:54,583
Bholaraam lock him in the room!

531
00:33:54,583 --> 00:33:56,743
What?
Whom is she calling mad?

532
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:57,416
Not you.

533
00:33:57,416 --> 00:33:59,082
I said you are Sir's friend!

534
00:33:59,082 --> 00:34:02,038
But he thinks he is Sir Rajeevlal!

535
00:34:02,038 --> 00:34:02,526
What do you mean?

536
00:34:02,526 --> 00:34:04,812
I mean you are.....

537
00:34:04,812 --> 00:34:05,816
....a psychic?

538
00:34:05,816 --> 00:34:06,914
No, No nothing like that!

539
00:34:06,914 --> 00:34:08,402
I had just told them!

540
00:34:08,402 --> 00:34:17,776
You started throwing things at them
and they will start believing!

541
00:34:17,776 --> 00:34:19,218
Have you really lost it?

542
00:34:19,218 --> 00:34:23,442
It is very necessary for me to behave in
that manner since you've told!

543
00:34:23,442 --> 00:34:25,761
Sir, I couldnt think of anything else!

544
00:34:25,761 --> 00:34:28,375
No one will consider you as Sir Rajeevlal.....

545
00:34:28,375 --> 00:34:30,253
...and no one will be there to harass you.

546
00:34:30,253 --> 00:34:31,059
Very good.....

547
00:34:31,059 --> 00:34:35,278
...what an idea!

548
00:34:35,278 --> 00:34:36,857
Do you want anything Sir?
No!

549
00:34:36,857 --> 00:34:42,881
You did a good job of removing them from here!

550
00:34:42,881 --> 00:34:44,242
What book is this?

551
00:34:44,242 --> 00:34:46,272
An evening in Paris!

552
00:34:46,272 --> 00:34:49,206
The girls had kept it here!
The smell will remain for few more days!

553
00:34:49,206 --> 00:34:51,717
I dont like this artificial fragrance

554
00:34:51,717 --> 00:34:53,999
I will get you some fresh flowers tomorrow morning!

555
00:34:53,999 --> 00:34:56,504
It will make you feel fresh!

556
00:34:56,504 --> 00:34:57,029
Bholaraam.....

557
00:34:57,029 --> 00:35:00,036
....I have heard girls sell flowers here!

558
00:35:00,036 --> 00:35:01,925
Even boys sell!

559
00:35:01,925 --> 00:35:04,563
I want special varieties of flowers

560
00:35:04,563 --> 00:35:11,436
You get them immediately!

561
00:35:11,436 --> 00:35:13,562
Who are you?
What do you want?

562
00:35:13,562 --> 00:35:15,502
Heard some wealthy merchant has come to stay!

563
00:35:15,502 --> 00:35:17,646
They really like flowers!

564
00:35:17,646 --> 00:35:20,425
You dont have the kind of flowers he wants!

565
00:35:20,425 --> 00:35:22,528
Atleast have a look!

566
00:35:22,528 --> 00:35:24,685
Many florists had come to sell these flowers!

567
00:35:24,685 --> 00:35:37,733
Sir sent them back!
Now go!

568
00:35:37,733 --> 00:35:38,981
Bholaraam!

569
00:35:38,981 --> 00:35:40,836
Bholaraam!
Yes Sir.

570
00:35:40,836 --> 00:35:41,083
Quickly Come up!

571
00:35:41,083 --> 00:35:47,283
Coming Sir!

572
00:35:47,283 --> 00:35:49,012
Some florist had come?

573
00:35:49,012 --> 00:35:51,306
She dint have that special variety so I fled her!

574
00:35:51,306 --> 00:35:52,536
Send her here!

575
00:35:52,536 --> 00:35:53,878
I saw her flowers!

576
00:35:53,878 --> 00:36:12,675
I want to see her flowers go and send for her!

577
00:36:12,675 --> 00:36:14,859
Sir!

578
00:36:14,859 --> 00:36:17,318
Who is it?

579
00:36:17,318 --> 00:36:18,584
Florist!

580
00:36:18,584 --> 00:36:29,041
Come in.

581
00:36:29,041 --> 00:36:30,607
I am in.

582
00:36:30,607 --> 00:36:32,824
Which flowers do you have?

583
00:36:32,824 --> 00:36:38,244
I have roses, lotus, Jasmine!

584
00:36:38,244 --> 00:36:39,039
How much is it for?

585
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:42,348
5 rupees for the entire basket.

586
00:36:42,348 --> 00:36:44,189
Keep the basket here.

587
00:36:44,189 --> 00:36:50,683
Yes!

588
00:36:50,683 --> 00:36:53,834
You wont get such flowers anywhere in Kashmir.

589
00:36:53,834 --> 00:36:55,128
These are Champa's flowers!

590
00:36:55,128 --> 00:36:56,038
You are lying?

591
00:36:56,038 --> 00:36:57,577
Not a single Magnolia is there in the basket!

592
00:36:57,577 --> 00:36:58,606
No, No

593
00:36:58,606 --> 00:37:02,253
I am Champa!

594
00:37:02,253 --> 00:37:04,996
What else can it be?

595
00:37:04,996 --> 00:37:07,795
You?

596
00:37:07,795 --> 00:37:12,721
Yes me!

597
00:37:12,721 --> 00:37:16,027
You are staring at me like you have never seen me!

598
00:37:16,027 --> 00:37:17,381
How are you here?

599
00:37:17,381 --> 00:37:19,648
I am Sir's driver!

600
00:37:19,648 --> 00:37:22,024
Then why did you sit on his chair?

601
00:37:22,024 --> 00:37:26,105
I behave like my sir, when my sir is not around!

602
00:37:26,105 --> 00:37:27,513
He is not there?

603
00:37:27,513 --> 00:37:28,667
He has gone to meet our madam!

604
00:37:28,667 --> 00:37:32,203
He told me to buy flowers from a florist.

605
00:37:32,203 --> 00:37:33,046
Please buy.

606
00:37:33,046 --> 00:37:37,201
Then I wont have to wander in sun!

607
00:37:37,201 --> 00:37:39,347
Take this.

608
00:37:39,347 --> 00:37:40,426
20 rupees!

609
00:37:40,426 --> 00:37:41,332
This is too much.

610
00:37:41,332 --> 00:37:42,233
Its less.

611
00:37:42,233 --> 00:37:45,391
My Sir would have given 50 rupees
if he was in my place.

612
00:37:45,391 --> 00:37:46,416
50 rupees?

613
00:37:46,416 --> 00:37:47,661
Yes!

614
00:37:47,661 --> 00:37:51,862
You were right your master is a great man.

615
00:37:51,862 --> 00:37:54,402
And me?

616
00:37:54,402 --> 00:37:57,243
You?

617
00:37:57,243 --> 00:37:59,443
Even you are a nice man.

618
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:01,889
Champa if I buy your flowers every day....

619
00:38:01,889 --> 00:38:03,715
....what will you gift me?

620
00:38:03,715 --> 00:38:08,782
Whatever you want!

621
00:38:08,782 --> 00:38:11,012
Can I pin this flower in your hair?

622
00:38:11,012 --> 00:38:13,529
I thought you'll ask for money!

623
00:38:13,529 --> 00:38:14,061
Here!

624
00:38:14,061 --> 00:38:16,906
Pin it!

625
00:38:16,906 --> 00:38:17,632
Make it quick!

626
00:38:17,632 --> 00:38:19,681
What if your master comes?

627
00:38:19,681 --> 00:38:21,727
I will tell him, I love you!

628
00:38:21,727 --> 00:38:23,907
If he asks you, even you accept!

629
00:38:23,907 --> 00:38:26,633
I dont lie.

630
00:38:26,633 --> 00:38:32,384
Even I dont lie.

631
00:38:32,384 --> 00:38:33,789
You just lied.

632
00:38:33,789 --> 00:38:34,524
What?

633
00:38:34,524 --> 00:38:37,082
That you...!

634
00:38:37,082 --> 00:38:38,927
I love you?

635
00:38:38,927 --> 00:38:39,962
I do love you.

636
00:38:39,962 --> 00:38:41,055
Definitely Yes!

637
00:38:41,055 --> 00:38:41,616
Its true.

638
00:38:41,616 --> 00:38:51,469
Dont joke.

639
00:38:51,469 --> 00:38:54,515
You will come back tomorrow?

640
00:38:54,515 --> 00:38:56,196
I dont know.

641
00:38:56,196 --> 00:38:58,478
Leave me.

642
00:38:58,478 --> 00:39:00,122
Say you will!

643
00:39:00,122 --> 00:39:01,958
Say!

644
00:39:01,958 --> 00:39:27,033
I will come!

645
00:39:27,033 --> 00:39:28,609
You came early today?

646
00:39:28,609 --> 00:39:29,568
Yes father!

647
00:39:29,568 --> 00:39:31,548
I am very happy today!

648
00:39:31,548 --> 00:39:33,735
You have sold all the flowers today!

649
00:39:33,735 --> 00:39:34,636
Yes father!

650
00:39:34,636 --> 00:39:37,276
And guess in how much!

651
00:39:37,276 --> 00:39:40,135
25 paise more!

652
00:39:40,135 --> 00:39:40,957
No father!

653
00:39:40,957 --> 00:39:42,186
20 rupees!

654
00:39:42,186 --> 00:39:43,698
20 rupees?

655
00:39:43,698 --> 00:39:44,631
Yes father!

656
00:39:44,631 --> 00:39:46,729
The one who has bought them is a driver.

657
00:39:46,729 --> 00:39:49,828
He was saying, his sir would have given 50 rupees!

658
00:39:49,828 --> 00:39:50,877
Champa!

659
00:39:50,877 --> 00:39:53,059
Return him, his 15 rupees!

660
00:39:53,059 --> 00:39:54,276
Why father?

661
00:39:54,276 --> 00:39:57,407
We should take the equivalent money and nothing more!

662
00:39:57,407 --> 00:39:59,616
But if someone gives gladly!

663
00:39:59,616 --> 00:40:01,717
He definitely wants something then!

664
00:40:01,717 --> 00:40:03,059
No father!

665
00:40:03,059 --> 00:40:04,842
That driver is a very good man.

666
00:40:04,842 --> 00:40:08,698
You cant really make out anybody's intention
by looking at his face!

667
00:40:08,698 --> 00:40:10,003
Return his money back to him.

668
00:40:10,003 --> 00:40:11,726
And dont go there again!

669
00:40:11,726 --> 00:40:13,666
I wont go!

670
00:40:13,666 --> 00:40:16,209
But we need money.

671
00:40:16,209 --> 00:40:17,514
What is the need to return it?

672
00:40:17,514 --> 00:40:19,552
No child you dont know...

673
00:40:19,552 --> 00:40:22,191
....a man can trait his soul for money!

674
00:40:22,191 --> 00:40:24,433
He becomes a devil!

675
00:40:24,433 --> 00:40:27,851
Father!

676
00:40:27,851 --> 00:40:29,497
My child....

677
00:40:29,497 --> 00:40:33,081
....be satisfied....

678
00:40:33,081 --> 00:40:40,353
...in what you get!

679
00:40:40,353 --> 00:40:41,355
Chandar....

680
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:42,798
....dont worry about it.

681
00:40:42,798 --> 00:40:44,034
Wait at the airport I am coming to pick you up.

682
00:40:44,034 --> 00:40:44,861
Yes!

683
00:40:44,861 --> 00:40:46,129
Chandar babu will also stay here?

684
00:40:46,129 --> 00:40:46,722
Yes!

685
00:40:46,722 --> 00:40:48,937
I called you the fake owner, what will I call him?

686
00:40:48,937 --> 00:40:50,714
Make him the real boss!

687
00:40:50,714 --> 00:40:52,865
Tell everyone he is Sir Rajeevlal!

688
00:40:52,865 --> 00:40:54,829
I will explain Chandar!

689
00:40:54,829 --> 00:41:02,188
No words I have for you!

690
00:41:02,188 --> 00:41:03,234
Bholaraam!

691
00:41:03,234 --> 00:41:04,619
Your Sir has still not arrived!

692
00:41:04,619 --> 00:41:07,552
Bholaraam, you should have gone to pick him.

693
00:41:07,552 --> 00:41:09,367
Why did you send that psychic?

694
00:41:09,367 --> 00:41:10,416
Bholaraam!

695
00:41:10,416 --> 00:41:12,392
How is he in looks?

696
00:41:12,392 --> 00:41:15,282
Tell us!

697
00:41:15,282 --> 00:41:27,865
He has arrived.

698
00:41:27,865 --> 00:41:30,975
Salute the boss.

699
00:41:30,975 --> 00:41:32,486
You are saluting the fake boss?

700
00:41:32,486 --> 00:41:38,497
Salute the real boss!

701
00:41:38,497 --> 00:41:40,951
She is Ramadevi!

702
00:41:40,951 --> 00:41:48,849
Greetings!

703
00:41:48,849 --> 00:41:50,384
They are Chhaya, Maya, Rekha!

704
00:41:50,384 --> 00:41:51,168
What?

705
00:41:51,168 --> 00:41:53,165
Rekha, Maya, Chhaya!

706
00:41:53,165 --> 00:41:55,193
Greetings Sir!

707
00:41:55,193 --> 00:41:56,279
Greetings!

708
00:41:56,279 --> 00:41:57,366
Greetings!

709
00:41:57,366 --> 00:42:01,679
Greetings!

710
00:42:01,679 --> 00:42:03,058
My friend is...

711
00:42:03,058 --> 00:42:04,454
.....mad!

712
00:42:04,454 --> 00:42:11,425
He calls himself Sir Rajeevlal!

713
00:42:11,425 --> 00:42:13,427
Are you married Sir?

714
00:42:13,427 --> 00:42:13,841
No!

715
00:42:13,841 --> 00:42:15,788
I am finding a girl!

716
00:42:15,788 --> 00:42:16,604
What kinds?

717
00:42:16,604 --> 00:42:18,065
The one I can get married to.

718
00:42:18,065 --> 00:42:23,743
According to my father's will I have to get
married before I turn 30

719
00:42:23,743 --> 00:42:25,934
What is your age, Sir?

720
00:42:25,934 --> 00:42:30,133
Yes?

721
00:42:30,133 --> 00:42:33,281
He is three years younger to me!

722
00:42:33,281 --> 00:42:38,878
And I am three years younger to her!

723
00:42:38,878 --> 00:42:44,995
I am sorry my friend is insane!

724
00:42:44,995 --> 00:42:48,001
He is worse than the previous one!

725
00:42:48,001 --> 00:42:49,702
But he is wealthy!

726
00:42:49,702 --> 00:42:51,281
He is finding a girl to get married!

727
00:42:51,281 --> 00:43:06,846
We should plan something!

728
00:43:06,846 --> 00:43:09,326
How did I act?

729
00:43:09,326 --> 00:43:09,956
Very good.

730
00:43:09,956 --> 00:43:12,054
You acted like a joker!

731
00:43:12,054 --> 00:43:14,488
Even those girls believed me!

732
00:43:14,488 --> 00:43:16,207
They did not believe you!

733
00:43:16,207 --> 00:43:18,152
They are only concerned with money!

734
00:43:18,152 --> 00:43:21,351
Another fool was also enough to convince them!

735
00:43:21,351 --> 00:43:22,272
Dont say this!

736
00:43:22,272 --> 00:43:26,135
3 girls at the same time have a crush on me!

737
00:43:26,135 --> 00:43:27,738
You will suffer what do I do?

738
00:43:27,738 --> 00:43:29,187
Sir!

739
00:43:29,187 --> 00:43:30,007
Who is it?

740
00:43:30,007 --> 00:43:35,199
I have work with the real boss and not with you!

741
00:43:35,199 --> 00:43:37,322
That florist had again visited us today!

742
00:43:37,322 --> 00:43:38,297
You dint ask her to wait?

743
00:43:38,297 --> 00:43:39,959
You have even got a driver along with you?

744
00:43:39,959 --> 00:43:41,258
Answer to what you are asked to!

745
00:43:41,258 --> 00:43:41,929
She left?

746
00:43:41,929 --> 00:43:43,517
She dint give me a chance to talk.

747
00:43:43,517 --> 00:43:45,523
She gave me 15 rupees and she left!

748
00:43:45,523 --> 00:43:48,136
And has said when his driver comes hand it over to him!

749
00:43:48,136 --> 00:43:49,666
Since then I am thinking.....

750
00:43:49,666 --> 00:43:51,063
....Who is this driver?

751
00:43:51,063 --> 00:43:52,027
I am the driver!

752
00:43:52,027 --> 00:43:53,439
Who is Seth Sanjeevlal's son?

753
00:43:53,439 --> 00:43:54,666
I am also his son!

754
00:43:54,666 --> 00:43:55,914
I had paid her, why did you take them?

755
00:43:55,914 --> 00:43:57,647
1 basket costed you 20 rupees?

756
00:43:57,647 --> 00:43:58,881
What's the matter?

757
00:43:58,881 --> 00:44:01,304
Nonsense!

758
00:44:01,304 --> 00:44:02,672
Where did she go?
To the market!

759
00:44:02,672 --> 00:44:05,084
To the market?

760
00:44:05,084 --> 00:44:08,257
How does she look?

761
00:44:08,257 --> 00:44:25,725
She is a daughter to me!

762
00:44:25,725 --> 00:44:28,176
There is no one in this boat....

763
00:44:28,176 --> 00:44:30,795
....these flowers will die under the sun!

764
00:44:30,795 --> 00:44:33,649
Take me near the boat.

765
00:44:33,649 --> 00:44:39,597

You?

767
00:44:40,695 --> 00:44:42,745
I thought there is no one in the boat!

768
00:44:42,745 --> 00:44:43,605
Shut up.

769
00:44:43,605 --> 00:44:45,183
You wet my clothes!

770
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:47,683
The other day you showered cold water on me!

771
00:44:47,683 --> 00:44:49,264
I dint get angry that day!

772
00:44:49,264 --> 00:44:52,918
You have come to take a revenge of that day?

773
00:44:52,918 --> 00:44:53,573
No!

774
00:44:53,573 --> 00:44:56,316
I am here to ask you, why did you return my money?

775
00:44:56,316 --> 00:44:58,124
Why?
Say!

776
00:44:58,124 --> 00:45:01,232
When a guy pays 20 rupees for 5 rupees.....

777
00:45:01,232 --> 00:45:02,934
....he is not a good guy.

778
00:45:02,934 --> 00:45:04,022
Really?

779
00:45:04,022 --> 00:45:05,285

00:45:05,285 --> 00:45:07,532
My father!

781
00:45:07,532 --> 00:45:13,259
And you believed him?

782
00:45:13,259 --> 00:45:16,508
This means you like me?

783
00:45:16,508 --> 00:45:17,922
When did I say so?

784
00:45:17,922 --> 00:45:19,246
You dint say?

785
00:45:19,246 --> 00:45:25,335

786
00:45:25,335 --> 00:45:27,191

00:45:51,818 --> 00:45:54,042

794
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:56,024

"....they were right"

809
00:46:52,994 --> 00:46:57,323
"....they were right"

810
00:46:57,323 --> 00:46:59,493
"There is some magic......"

811
00:46:59,493 --> 00:47:01,686
"....in your walk"

812
00:47:01,686 --> 00:47:03,693

Where else will he go?

923
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:25,467
Let him sleep.

924
00:53:25,467 --> 00:53:27,462

What is he saying?

931
00:53:37,777 --> 00:53:38,926
He is seeing a dream.

932
00:53:38,926 --> 00:53:40,849
He only sees one dream everyday!

933
00:53:40,849 --> 00:53:41,217

936
00:53:45,528 --> 00:53:53,666
...and they fight!

937
00:53:53,666 --> 00:53:55,935

938
00:53:55,935 --> 00:53:57,258
Listen!

939
00:53:57,258 --> 00:53:59,569
Dont go out its a Moonlit night!

940
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:00,782
Thank you!

941
00:54:00,782 --> 00:54:02,007
You saved me in my bad times!

942
00:54:02,007 --> 00:54:03,832
Go and sleep!

943
00:54:03,832 --> 00:54:05,585
The third one will be here anytime!

944
00:54:05,585 --> 00:54:06,474
Chhaya will be coming!

945
00:54:06,474 --> 00:54:07,682
Come on!

946
00:54:07,682 --> 00:54:08,267
Let me change clothes!

947
00:54:08,267 --> 00:54:09,565
Sleep the way you are!

948
00:54:09,565 --> 00:54:19,526
When a vulture dies you run like a girl!

949
00:54:19,526 --> 00:54:48,828
Sleep!

950
00:54:48,828 --> 00:54:52,961
You are staring at me like you have never
seen me before!

951
00:54:52,961 --> 00:54:55,139
I have never seen you in this way!

952
00:54:55,139 --> 00:54:59,698
You'll find me to be different every time you see me!

953
00:54:59,698 --> 00:55:04,306
May be you'll like me in some form!

954
00:55:04,306 --> 00:55:06,153
I used to drive.....

955
00:55:06,153 --> 00:55:08,092
From a car, I started row a boat...

956
00:55:08,092 --> 00:55:10,189
From a boat, I have started riding a horse!

957
00:55:10,189 --> 00:55:12,004
I dont know what all things I will have to do for you.

958
00:55:12,004 --> 00:55:13,411
For me?

959
00:55:13,411 --> 00:55:14,266
Then what?

960
00:55:14,266 --> 00:55:15,746
I dont have a habit of riding horses.

961
00:55:15,746 --> 00:55:17,729
And I reached your place!

962
00:55:17,729 --> 00:55:18,768
My house?

963
00:55:18,768 --> 00:55:21,435
Who gave you my address?

964
00:55:21,435 --> 00:55:22,417
Flowers helped me!

965
00:55:22,417 --> 00:55:23,242
What?

966
00:55:23,242 --> 00:55:24,232
Come with me!

967
00:55:24,232 --> 00:55:25,615
I'll show you.

968
00:55:25,615 --> 00:55:27,565
Come!

969
00:55:27,565 --> 00:55:28,849
See this.

970
00:55:28,849 --> 00:55:30,858
So many flowers!

971
00:55:30,858 --> 00:55:32,177

972
00:55:32,177 --> 00:55:34,247
I reached near the lake in search of you....

973
00:55:34,247 --> 00:55:37,373
.....you friends laid a condition, till I dont
buy their flowers.....

974
00:55:37,373 --> 00:55:39,065
...they wont give me your address!

975
00:55:39,065 --> 00:55:40,047
Seriously?

976
00:55:40,047 --> 00:55:42,635
Yes!

977
00:55:42,635 --> 00:55:44,635
Now if I go near the lake to sell flowers....

978
00:55:44,635 --> 00:55:46,846
....all the girls will tease me!

979
00:55:46,846 --> 00:55:48,557
So dont go!

980
00:55:48,557 --> 00:55:52,548
I cant go home empty handed in the evening!

981
00:55:52,548 --> 00:55:54,493
Give me your hand.

982
00:55:54,493 --> 00:55:56,442
Take this!

983
00:55:56,442 --> 00:55:57,747
All the flowers are sold!

984
00:55:57,747 --> 00:55:58,955
Now you are free till evening!

985
00:55:58,955 --> 00:56:01,702
Come!

986
00:56:01,702 --> 00:56:02,118
Sit!

987
00:56:02,118 --> 00:56:03,472
Why?

988
00:56:03,472 --> 00:56:05,918
We will roam the entire day!

989
00:56:05,918 --> 00:56:07,612
There are many places to see

990
00:56:07,612 --> 00:56:11,307
You can go!

991
00:56:11,307 --> 00:56:12,445
We will go together!

992
00:56:12,445 --> 00:56:13,659
Show me the way.

993
00:56:13,659 --> 00:56:15,111
No!

994
00:56:15,111 --> 00:56:16,134
I wont go.

995
00:56:16,134 --> 00:56:21,829
Champa!

996
00:56:21,829 --> 00:56:22,857
Come on quickly!

997
00:56:22,857 --> 00:56:24,002
But!

998
00:56:24,002 --> 00:56:25,545
Come on!

999
00:56:25,545 --> 00:56:27,297
Sometime back u said no and now you say we’ll go!

1000
00:56:27,297 --> 00:56:29,363
You are weird!

1001
00:56:29,363 --> 00:56:30,498
Who is he?

1002
00:56:30,498 --> 00:56:52,989
Listen to me!

1003
00:56:52,989 --> 00:56:54,418
Who was that scoundrel?

1004
00:56:54,418 --> 00:56:55,461
Mohan!

1005
00:56:55,461 --> 00:56:56,704
He is in charge of the jungle!

1006
00:56:56,704 --> 00:56:58,243
But why are you scared of him?

1007
00:56:58,243 --> 00:57:00,038
My father is his debtor!

1008
00:57:00,038 --> 00:57:01,647
If he becomes upset....

1009
00:57:01,647 --> 00:57:03,494
...he can remove us from the village.

1010
00:57:03,494 --> 00:57:05,379
Mohan comes to your place?

1011
00:57:05,379 --> 00:57:07,052
Yes!

1012
00:57:07,052 --> 00:57:08,066
He comes to meet my father.....

1013
00:57:08,066 --> 00:57:10,393
...but always harasses me a lot.

1014
00:57:10,393 --> 00:57:13,368
What do you mean?

1015
00:57:13,368 --> 00:57:14,243
He wants to...

1016
00:57:14,243 --> 00:57:15,999
.....get married to you?

1017
00:57:15,999 --> 00:57:17,368
Is it?

1018
00:57:17,368 --> 00:57:19,084
If he tells you anything....

1019
00:57:19,084 --> 00:57:21,122
...tell me!

1020
00:57:21,122 --> 00:57:22,227
What will you do?

1021
00:57:22,227 --> 00:57:23,633
He is very cruel!

1022
00:57:23,633 --> 00:57:25,056
I will teach him a lesson.

1023
00:57:25,056 --> 00:57:26,838
Henceforth if you need something....

1024
00:57:26,838 --> 00:57:27,974
.....tell me!

1025
00:57:27,974 --> 00:57:29,926
I will pay your fathers debt!

1026
00:57:29,926 --> 00:57:31,367
Its 500 rupees!

1027
00:57:31,367 --> 00:57:32,635
Where will you get from?

1028
00:57:32,635 --> 00:57:36,479
I?

1029
00:57:36,479 --> 00:57:38,006
I'll rob!

1030
00:57:38,006 --> 00:57:39,607
Rob?

1031
00:57:39,607 --> 00:57:41,003
Yes!

1032
00:57:41,003 --> 00:57:42,425
I can do anything and everything for you.

1033
00:57:42,425 --> 00:57:43,741
I can even give up on life!

1034
00:57:43,741 --> 00:57:52,384
Thats it.

1035
00:57:52,384 --> 00:57:54,419
What happen?

1036
00:57:54,419 --> 00:57:55,351
Nothing!

1037
00:57:55,351 --> 00:58:42,335
Lets leave!

1038
00:58:42,335 --> 00:58:46,112
Its a beautiful valley!

1039
00:58:46,112 --> 00:59:56,493
And so I wonder why my heart waits for my love!

1040
00:59:56,493 --> 01:00:04,866
Till it rains we'll wait here!

1041
01:00:04,866 --> 01:00:07,007
Anybody there?

1042
01:00:07,007 --> 01:00:08,784
Anybody there?

1043
01:00:08,784 --> 01:00:09,972
Where are you going?

1044
01:00:09,972 --> 01:00:11,027
Whose house is it?

1045
01:00:11,027 --> 01:00:14,064
Its very cold outside!

1046
01:00:14,064 --> 01:00:18,632
Fire!

1047
01:00:18,632 --> 01:00:31,205
Someone is sleeping here.

1048
01:00:31,205 --> 01:00:33,642
Grand-mother!

1049
01:00:33,642 --> 01:00:34,591
Who is it?

1050
01:00:34,591 --> 01:00:35,595
Greetings!

1051
01:00:35,595 --> 01:00:38,118
Its raining outside!

1052
01:00:38,118 --> 02:01:16,878
What?

1053
01:00:38,076 --> 01:00:40,431
We want to stay here for a while.

1054
01:00:40,431 --> 01:00:42,891
We will leave once its stops raining!

1055
01:00:42,891 --> 01:00:44,433
Say loudly!

1056
01:00:44,433 --> 01:00:46,923
I cant hear!

1057
01:00:46,923 --> 01:00:48,578
Sleeping like a log!

1058
01:00:48,578 --> 01:00:51,178
Its raining outside.

1059
01:00:51,178 --> 01:00:53,586
We want to stay here for a while.

1060
01:00:53,586 --> 01:00:55,351
Its raining outside.

1061
01:00:55,351 --> 01:00:59,621
Yes!

1062
01:00:59,621 --> 01:01:08,457
She is your wife?

1063
01:01:08,457 --> 01:01:10,049
Are you a man?

1064
01:01:10,049 --> 01:01:12,529
She is shivering!

1065
01:01:12,529 --> 01:01:13,924
And you are looking at her face!

1066
01:01:13,924 --> 01:01:16,626
If she gets cold, she'll fall sick.

1067
01:01:16,626 --> 01:01:17,905
Come with me!

1068
01:01:17,905 --> 01:01:25,329
Come!

1069
01:01:25,329 --> 01:01:28,049
Change your clothes!

1070
01:01:28,049 --> 01:01:31,034
So what he is your husband!

1071
01:01:31,034 --> 01:01:33,953
You are behaving like you were married yesterday!

1072
01:01:33,953 --> 01:01:35,614
Okay go on top and change there.

1073
01:01:35,614 --> 01:01:43,003
Go!

1074
01:01:43,003 --> 01:01:44,535
You also go and change.

1075
01:01:44,535 --> 01:01:46,055
Go else you will catch cold.

1076
01:01:46,055 --> 01:02:06,798
Go quickly!

1077
01:02:06,798 --> 01:02:14,854
Hang them, they'll dry soon!

1078
01:02:14,854 --> 01:02:17,835
Hey beautiful....

1079
01:02:17,835 --> 01:02:19,687
...please hang my clothes also!

1080
01:02:19,687 --> 01:02:23,058
My son's and daughter in law's clothes fit you well....

1081
01:02:23,058 --> 01:02:26,637
....he had bought this suit last year from the fair.

1082
01:02:26,637 --> 01:02:27,743
Really?

1083
01:02:27,743 --> 01:02:28,368
Yes

1084
01:02:28,368 --> 01:02:30,596
Sorry for giving you trouble!

1085
01:02:30,596 --> 01:02:31,773
You go and rest!

1086
01:02:31,773 --> 01:02:33,688
Those two?

1087
01:02:33,688 --> 01:02:34,888
They had gone to the market....

1088
01:02:34,888 --> 01:02:37,925
...they must be trapped somewhere.

1089
01:02:37,925 --> 01:02:39,621
Even an enemy shouldnt be trapped this way!

1090
01:02:39,621 --> 01:02:41,019
What did she say?

1091
01:02:41,019 --> 01:02:45,039
Till you son and daughter in law dont return.....

1092
01:02:45,039 --> 01:02:47,322
.....you can consider us your son and daughter in law!

1093
01:02:47,322 --> 01:02:49,067
Was this supposed to be said?

1094
01:02:49,067 --> 01:02:54,436
I will sleep now!

1095
01:02:54,436 --> 01:02:56,374
Take care of the house!

1096
01:02:56,374 --> 01:02:58,799
Definitely!

1097
01:02:58,799 --> 01:03:01,282
Once these clothes dry up, wear them and leave!

1098
01:03:01,282 --> 01:03:03,113
I will make you sleep!

1099
01:03:03,113 --> 01:03:07,485
Come!

1100
01:03:07,485 --> 01:03:14,013
Sleep comfortably!

1101
01:03:14,013 --> 01:03:21,587
Without taking tensions!

1102
01:03:21,587 --> 01:03:26,116
Champa

1103
01:03:26,116 --> 01:03:28,399
You are looking very beautiful in these clothes!
Shut up!

1104
01:03:28,399 --> 01:03:29,619
I really like you!
Shut up.

1105
01:03:29,619 --> 01:03:32,329
The weather is becoming better but
your temper is still the same

1106
01:03:32,329 --> 01:03:34,594
I dont feel like looking at you also.

1107
01:03:34,594 --> 01:03:35,334
Why?

1108
01:03:35,334 --> 01:03:37,093
Your grandmother spoke nonsense!

1109
01:03:37,093 --> 01:03:39,105
And you were nodding your head.

1110
01:03:39,105 --> 01:03:41,452
God keeps her 100 years alive!

1111
01:03:41,452 --> 01:03:44,371
She will bless us when we get married!

1112
01:03:44,371 --> 01:03:45,425
What?

1113
01:03:45,425 --> 01:03:47,236
When we get married!

1114
01:03:47,236 --> 01:03:48,811
Arent u ashamed?

1115
01:03:48,811 --> 01:03:50,145
What's so shameful?

1116
01:03:50,145 --> 01:03:53,207
Every man gets married and has children!

1117
01:03:53,207 --> 01:03:54,974
But who will get married to you?

1118
01:03:54,974 --> 01:03:59,032
Why are you getting angry, someone will!

1119
01:03:59,032 --> 01:04:04,602
I even like you!

1120
01:04:04,602 --> 01:04:07,292
Really good!

1121
01:04:07,292 --> 01:04:07,995
Seriously!

1122
01:04:07,995 --> 01:04:43,014
"The one who stole my heart with only plain actions"

1123
01:04:43,014 --> 01:04:48,578
"Tel me how did u learn to do so?"

1124
01:04:48,578 --> 01:04:54,051
"Making miracles only through meeting of the eyes"

1125
01:04:54,051 --> 01:05:14,517
"My love where did u learn this from?"

1126
01:05:14,517 --> 01:05:20,076
"You impressed my heart"

1127
01:05:20,076 --> 01:05:26,586
"what had I done?"

1128
01:05:26,586 --> 01:05:32,571
"The one who tortured me...."

1129
01:05:32,571 --> 01:05:38,346
"......was these actions itself"

1130
01:05:38,346 --> 01:05:44,281
"......was these actions itself"

1131
01:05:44,281 --> 01:05:47,343
"The story of the lover....."

1132
01:05:47,343 --> 01:05:50,341
"......and the tales of Romeo......"

1133
01:05:50,341 --> 01:05:56,257
".....is not at all different from my story"

1134
01:05:56,257 --> 01:06:02,079
"The one who stole my heart with only plain actions"

1135
01:06:02,079 --> 01:06:25,352
"Tell me how did u learn to do so?"

1136
01:06:25,352 --> 01:06:36,489
"People who love, they do not show it"

1137
01:06:36,489 --> 01:06:48,392
"The heartbeats of our heart, we dont let others hear them"

1138
01:06:48,392 --> 01:06:53,027
"We dont let others hear them"

1139
01:06:53,027 --> 01:07:00,199
"What is the fun when we do it ourselves?"

1140
01:07:00,199 --> 01:07:05,041
"The proposal of our love by ourselves"

1141
01:07:05,041 --> 01:07:11,115
"Making miracles only through meeting of the eyes"

1142
01:07:11,115 --> 01:07:34,113
"My love where did u learn this from?"

1143
01:07:34,113 --> 01:07:39,861
"I agree that you are......"

1144
01:07:39,861 --> 01:07:45,599
"........one among the rest of the world"

1145
01:07:45,599 --> 01:07:51,558
"You have to praise......"

1146
01:07:51,558 --> 01:07:57,324
"......me for the good choice I have"

1147
01:07:57,324 --> 01:08:02,903
"Praise me for my choice"

1148
01:08:02,903 --> 01:08:08,096
"Even the eyes of this world had an eye on this flower"

1149
01:08:08,096 --> 01:08:14,937
"That is the same flower I have chosen from the garden"

1150
01:08:14,937 --> 01:08:20,446
"The one who stole my heart with only plain actions"

1151
01:08:20,446 --> 01:08:26,148
"Tel me how did u learn to do so?"

1152
01:08:26,148 --> 01:08:31,825
"Making miracles only through meeting of the eyes"

1153
01:08:31,825 --> 01:08:37,373
"My love where did u learn this from?"

1154
01:08:37,373 --> 01:08:42,933
"Tel me how did u learn to do so?"

1155
01:08:42,933 --> 01:08:48,832
"My love where did u learn this from?"

1156
01:08:48,832 --> 01:08:54,023
"Tel me how did u learn to do so?"

1157
01:08:54,023 --> 01:09:00,112
"My love where did u learn this from?"

1158
01:09:00,112 --> 01:09:17,274
"Tel me how did u learn to do so?"

1159
01:09:17,274 --> 01:09:18,954
Where are you coming from?

1160
01:09:18,954 --> 01:09:19,986
Had gone to sell flowers!

1161
01:09:19,986 --> 01:09:24,391
Along with flowers since when have you started
selling your love?

1162
01:09:24,391 --> 01:09:25,493
Leave my hand.

1163
01:09:25,493 --> 01:09:27,252
I have just caught your hand.....

1164
01:09:27,252 --> 01:09:29,991
....you have spent one entire day with that car owner!

1165
01:09:29,991 --> 01:09:30,976
Are you leaving me?

1166
01:09:30,976 --> 01:09:31,737
Father!

1167
01:09:31,737 --> 01:09:32,834
Father!

1168
01:09:32,834 --> 01:09:34,764
What happen?

1169
01:09:34,764 --> 01:09:35,863
What happen?

1170
01:09:35,863 --> 01:09:37,332
Its like....

1171
01:09:37,332 --> 01:09:39,914
...Champa is loosing herself!

1172
01:09:39,914 --> 01:09:40,599
Who is it?

1173
01:09:40,599 --> 01:09:41,584
Mohan?

1174
01:09:41,584 --> 01:09:42,691
Yes Father.

1175
01:09:42,691 --> 01:09:44,593
Ask her where was she the entire day?

1176
01:09:44,593 --> 01:09:48,132
It started raining very heavily today!

1177
01:09:48,132 --> 01:09:50,073
So I had to stay at one place.

1178
01:09:50,073 --> 01:09:51,923
With that guy who owns the car?

1179
01:09:51,923 --> 01:09:53,111
Whom are you talking about?

1180
01:09:53,111 --> 01:09:55,146
A met a decent man on my way!

1181
01:09:55,146 --> 01:09:57,023
He saved my life.

1182
01:09:57,023 --> 01:09:59,107
Else I wouldnt have been alive today.

1183
01:09:59,107 --> 01:10:02,738
No, dont say this.

1184
01:10:02,738 --> 01:10:05,966
My child has to really work hard all the time.

1185
01:10:05,966 --> 01:10:07,901
If I wouldnt have been blind....

1186
01:10:07,901 --> 01:10:11,067
...I would have never allowed you to work.

1187
01:10:11,067 --> 01:10:12,049
Still nothing's gone wrong.......

1188
01:10:12,049 --> 01:10:15,812
.....if you care about your reputation, stop
her from going out!

1189
01:10:15,812 --> 01:10:16,789
What do you mean?

1190
01:10:16,789 --> 01:10:19,418
Champa is not a child any more.

1191
01:10:19,418 --> 01:10:21,543
She is taking advantage of you being blind.

1192
01:10:21,543 --> 01:10:22,687
Mohan.

1193
01:10:22,687 --> 01:10:25,041
Dare if you say anything about Champa.

1194
01:10:25,041 --> 01:10:27,222
I have complete faith in my daughter.

1195
01:10:27,222 --> 01:10:30,927
On your daughter?

1196
01:10:30,927 --> 01:10:32,836
Father, please tell him to go away from here!

1197
01:10:32,836 --> 01:10:34,373
Who is he to interfere?

1198
01:10:34,373 --> 01:10:36,076
You go inside!

1199
01:10:36,076 --> 01:10:45,127
Go!

1200
01:10:45,127 --> 01:10:50,593
Where are you?
In front of you!

1201
01:10:50,593 --> 01:10:51,941
What do you know about Champa?

1202
01:10:51,941 --> 01:10:54,764
Champa is not your daughter.

1203
01:10:54,764 --> 01:10:55,893
How do you know?

1204
01:10:55,893 --> 01:10:58,899
Things cannot be hidden!

1205
01:10:58,899 --> 01:11:00,642
Look Mohan....

1206
01:11:00,642 --> 01:11:03,785
Champa should never know this truth.

1207
01:11:03,785 --> 01:11:06,528
Tell her from tomorrow she need not work.

1208
01:11:06,528 --> 01:11:08,847
She is only allowed to go out with me!

1209
01:11:08,847 --> 01:11:18,207
Understood?

1210
01:11:18,207 --> 01:11:19,149
Father!

1211
01:11:19,149 --> 01:11:20,549
I have prepared our food.

1212
01:11:20,549 --> 01:11:26,249
I am coming.

1213
01:11:26,249 --> 01:11:28,832
Today you prepared food little early?

1214
01:11:28,832 --> 01:11:30,726
Yes I will sleep early today.

1215
01:11:30,726 --> 01:11:33,608
I have to go to the fair tomorrow morning.

1216
01:11:33,608 --> 01:11:35,787
With?

1217
01:11:35,787 --> 01:11:38,551
I will go with a friend.

1218
01:11:38,551 --> 01:11:39,719
No!

1219
01:11:39,719 --> 01:11:43,581
Like every year I want you to go
to the festival with your friends

1220
01:11:43,581 --> 01:11:45,006
In Mohan's festival?

1221
01:11:45,006 --> 01:11:47,883
Yes with your friends!

1222
01:11:47,883 --> 01:11:50,273
But I dont wish to go!

1223
01:11:50,273 --> 01:11:51,664
Champa!

1224
01:11:51,664 --> 01:11:54,737
If you want to go for the fair, go with your friends!

1225
01:11:54,737 --> 01:11:59,118
Else I wont allow you to go alone!

1226
01:11:59,118 --> 01:12:01,106
Okay.

1227
01:12:01,106 --> 01:12:02,679
I will go with him.

1228
01:12:02,679 --> 01:12:05,037
I think for your good.

1229
01:12:05,037 --> 01:12:06,285
Champa...

1230
01:12:06,285 --> 01:12:07,364
Whose it?

1231
01:12:07,364 --> 01:12:08,868
Its Munni.

1232
01:12:08,868 --> 01:12:11,824
I am just coming.

1233
01:12:11,824 --> 01:12:13,368
Champa tomorrow you are coming for the fair?

1234
01:12:13,368 --> 01:12:16,772
Yes!

1235
01:12:16,772 --> 01:12:19,603
Munni, inform Raju...

1236
01:12:19,603 --> 01:12:21,584
....I wont be able to meet him tomorrow.

1237
01:12:21,584 --> 01:12:23,917
Now you have started meeting her every day?

1238
01:12:23,917 --> 01:12:41,346
I feel you will get married soon!

1239
01:12:41,346 --> 01:12:42,954
Why are you silent Champa?

1240
01:12:42,954 --> 01:12:44,858
Talk to me, be happy!

1241
01:12:44,858 --> 01:12:46,729
Its a big day today!

1242
01:12:46,729 --> 01:12:49,116
I am thinking....

1243
01:12:49,116 --> 01:12:51,857
....I will take a sari worth 100 rupees!

1244
01:12:51,857 --> 01:12:53,187
I have a sari to wear.

1245
01:12:53,187 --> 01:12:55,345
You have everything, Champa!

1246
01:12:55,345 --> 01:12:57,584
But you should have something of my choice!

1247
01:12:57,584 --> 01:12:58,535
Why?

1248
01:12:58,535 --> 01:13:02,883
Only because I like you!

1249
01:13:02,883 --> 01:13:04,948
Look ahead!

1250
01:13:04,948 --> 01:13:08,108
Stop the car.

1251
01:13:08,108 --> 01:13:10,706
God has sent you to help me.

1252
01:13:10,706 --> 01:13:11,916
Where are you going?

1253
01:13:11,916 --> 01:13:12,914
To the fair.

1254
01:13:12,914 --> 01:13:14,187
Take me along!

1255
01:13:14,187 --> 01:13:16,165
My wife cant walk.

1256
01:13:16,165 --> 01:13:18,753
She is pregnant.

1257
01:13:18,753 --> 01:13:19,954
There is no place in the truck!

1258
01:13:19,954 --> 01:13:21,138
Come in the next truck!

1259
01:13:21,138 --> 01:13:22,736
Give them a lift.

1260
01:13:22,736 --> 01:13:23,676
I refused him....

1261
01:13:23,676 --> 01:13:25,324
.....so that your friends .....

1262
01:13:25,324 --> 01:13:27,002
.....who are going to come from Pathancoat.....

1263
01:13:27,002 --> 01:13:28,928
.....do not face any problems!

1264
01:13:28,928 --> 01:13:30,334
If you say I will give them a lift.

1265
01:13:30,334 --> 01:13:31,406
Come sit.

1266
01:13:31,406 --> 01:13:34,649
God bless you!
Live long!

1267
01:13:34,649 --> 01:13:36,737
A man only understands a man's problem.

1268
01:13:36,737 --> 01:13:39,657
My beloved, you sit here....

1269
01:13:39,657 --> 01:13:41,994
.....I will make some place for you!

1270
01:13:41,994 --> 01:13:44,744
How will I sit with your wife?

1271
01:13:44,744 --> 01:13:45,095
I am not his wife.

1272
01:13:45,095 --> 01:13:48,197
She is my wife to be.

1273
01:13:48,197 --> 01:13:51,078
You sit with a stranger?

1274
01:13:51,078 --> 01:13:54,316
You sit with my wife!

1275
01:13:54,316 --> 01:13:55,634
I will sit with him!

1276
01:13:55,634 --> 01:13:56,471
Get down.

1277
01:13:56,471 --> 01:14:04,308
Get down.

1278
01:14:04,308 --> 01:14:05,042
Wait Champa.

1279
01:14:05,042 --> 01:14:06,223
You sit on the top!

1280
01:14:06,223 --> 01:14:07,446
I will help you.

1281
01:14:07,446 --> 01:14:08,431
What nonsense.

1282
01:14:08,431 --> 01:14:10,232
You will touch her?

1283
01:14:10,232 --> 01:14:11,725
You dont worry!

1284
01:14:11,725 --> 01:14:14,395
My wife will help her!

1285
01:14:14,395 --> 01:14:17,265
My beloved....

1286
01:14:17,265 --> 01:14:23,503
(Regional)

1287
01:14:23,503 --> 01:14:25,718
Khan, your wife is taller to you.

1288
01:14:25,718 --> 01:14:30,001
You dont know she is the shortest in her family.

1289
01:14:30,001 --> 01:14:33,364
Rest all of them are even taller than her.

1290
01:14:33,364 --> 01:14:56,028
Its surprising!

1291
01:14:56,028 --> 01:14:57,898
You said your wife cant walk.

1292
01:14:57,898 --> 01:15:01,039
My wife is a Pathani!

1293
01:15:01,039 --> 01:15:03,889
Within her weakness lies her strength!

1294
01:15:03,889 --> 01:15:10,036
Lets go, I'll tell some stories about her.

1295
01:15:10,036 --> 01:15:10,096
Brother!

1296
01:15:10,096 --> 01:15:12,038
What are you doing?

1297
01:15:12,038 --> 01:15:13,362
Drive!

1298
01:15:13,362 --> 01:15:26,509
Come on!

1299
01:15:26,509 --> 01:15:27,747
Your Majesty....

1300
01:15:27,747 --> 01:15:29,626
...only girls are there.

1301
01:15:29,626 --> 01:15:31,099
Why have you covered your face?

1302
01:15:31,099 --> 01:15:33,738
We want to see your face.

1303
01:15:33,738 --> 01:15:37,652
What will you do seeing my ugly face?

1304
01:15:37,652 --> 01:15:40,835
You all are so beautiful.

1305
01:15:40,835 --> 01:15:44,129
Who is the most beautiful amongst all?

1306
01:15:44,129 --> 01:15:46,077
The most beautiful?

1307
01:15:46,077 --> 01:15:47,786
Let me see!

1308
01:15:47,786 --> 01:16:03,881
My back!

1309
01:16:03,881 --> 01:16:06,664
She is the most beautiful of all.

1310
01:16:06,664 --> 01:16:14,743
The one who sees her will fall for her.

1311
01:16:14,743 --> 01:16:20,015
"Glorious is the Lord, such a beautiful face"

1312
01:16:20,015 --> 01:16:22,989
"Glorious is the Lord, such a beautiful face"

1313
01:16:22,989 --> 01:16:25,677
"This bewitching style"

1314
01:16:25,677 --> 01:16:32,808
"May the Lord protect you from every evil, from every evil!"

1315
01:16:32,808 --> 01:16:38,246
"When I set eyes on you, my heart said"

1316
01:16:38,246 --> 01:16:40,294
"When I set eyes on you, my heart said"

1317
01:16:40,294 --> 01:16:43,017
That I should only bless you

1318
01:16:43,017 --> 01:17:05,495
May the Lord protect you from every evil, from every evil!

1319
01:17:05,495 --> 01:17:13,887
"I wonder in whose fortune is this moon-like face bestowed"

1320
01:17:13,887 --> 01:17:22,032
"I wonder in whose home a piece of this moon will shine"

1321
01:17:22,032 --> 01:17:30,281
"I wonder in whose home a piece of this moon will shine"

1322
01:17:30,281 --> 01:17:34,657
"If I am permitted, may I also"

1323
01:17:34,657 --> 01:17:38,396
"If I am permitted, may I also"

1324
01:17:38,396 --> 01:17:41,246
"Chance my luck"

1325
01:17:41,246 --> 01:17:48,232
"May the Lord protect you from every evil, from every evil"

1326
01:17:48,232 --> 01:17:51,092
"Glorious is the Lord, such a beautiful face"

1327
01:17:51,092 --> 01:17:53,846
"This bewitching style"

1328
01:17:53,846 --> 01:18:16,035
"May the Lord protect you from every evil, from every evil"

1329
01:18:16,035 --> 01:18:24,024
"This world looks at you with a lot of expectation"

1330
01:18:24,024 --> 01:18:32,171
"Everybody wants to narrate his tale to you"

1331
01:18:32,171 --> 01:18:40,432
"Everybody wants to narrate his tale to you"

1332
01:18:40,432 --> 01:18:45,836
"There is a heart (mood), there is an atmosphere"

1333
01:18:45,836 --> 01:18:48,523
"There is a heart (mood), there is an atmosphere"

1334
01:18:48,523 --> 01:18:51,271
"Wherever you go"

1335
01:18:51,271 --> 01:18:57,596
"May the Lord protect you from every evil, from every evil"

1336
01:18:57,596 --> 01:19:00,751
"Glorious is the Lord, such a beautiful face"

1337
01:19:00,751 --> 01:19:03,664
"This bewitching style"

1338
01:19:03,664 --> 01:19:10,307
"May the Lord protect you from every evil, from every evil"

1339
01:19:10,307 --> 01:19:12,907
"When I set eyes on you, my heart said"

1340
01:19:12,907 --> 01:19:15,613
"That I should only bless you"

1341
01:19:15,613 --> 01:20:16,537
"May the Lord protect you from every evil, from every evil"

1342
01:20:16,537 --> 01:20:17,067
She went.

1343
01:20:17,067 --> 01:20:18,319
And my wife?

1344
01:20:18,319 --> 01:20:20,166
Even she left!

1345
01:20:20,166 --> 01:20:22,414
You said your wife is pregnant

1346
01:20:22,414 --> 01:20:23,476
Now how did she run?

1347
01:20:23,476 --> 01:20:26,032
My wife is a Pathani!

1348
01:20:26,032 --> 01:20:29,062
She must have gone to see the fair!
Lets find her!

1349
01:20:29,062 --> 01:20:41,243
Come on!

1350
01:20:41,243 --> 01:20:42,812
What if Mohan sees us?

1351
01:20:42,812 --> 01:20:44,766
Even I will screw him.

1352
01:20:44,766 --> 01:20:56,684
Come!

1353
01:20:56,684 --> 01:20:58,909
Who is it?

1354
01:20:58,909 --> 01:20:59,858
Where is your wife?

1355
01:20:59,858 --> 01:21:01,084
I am still finding her.

1356
01:21:01,084 --> 01:21:01,657
I havent found her as yet.

1357
01:21:01,657 --> 01:21:02,461
Find her quickly!

1358
01:21:02,461 --> 01:21:16,253
I am finding her.

1359
01:21:16,253 --> 01:21:19,521
Greetings!
Greetings!

1360
01:21:19,521 --> 01:21:21,087
Who was the one who came along with you?

1361
01:21:21,087 --> 01:21:23,557
He is my friend.

1362
01:21:23,557 --> 01:21:26,726
Why did you do this?

1363
01:21:26,726 --> 01:21:31,312
To meet you!

1364
01:21:31,312 --> 01:21:35,346
Will you have water melon?

1365
01:21:35,346 --> 01:21:37,787
Khan, seeing you I dont even feel.....

1366
01:21:37,787 --> 01:21:39,646
....like your wife has escaped from here!

1367
01:21:39,646 --> 01:21:41,364
I will eat and fill my stomach.

1368
01:21:41,364 --> 01:21:42,958
I will find her then!

1369
01:21:42,958 --> 01:21:46,334
We are not newly wedded that she will escape.

1370
01:21:46,334 --> 01:21:52,744
She is my wife since 3 years!

1371
01:21:52,744 --> 01:21:59,375
What is this?

1372
01:21:59,375 --> 01:22:01,007
Cant you see?

1373
01:22:01,007 --> 01:22:02,389
Why are you getting angry take money!

1374
01:22:02,389 --> 01:22:03,892
Leave me!

1375
01:22:03,892 --> 01:22:06,009
Take money!

1376
01:22:06,009 --> 01:22:07,507
Run!
What happen?

1377
01:22:07,507 --> 01:22:10,385
He is here!

1378
01:22:10,385 --> 01:22:57,696
Lets go.

1379
01:22:57,696 --> 01:23:07,781
"Your hand in my hand with some new emotions in my heart"

1380
01:23:07,781 --> 01:23:18,113
"If this remains forever, what else I want"

1381
01:23:18,113 --> 01:23:53,636
"Your hand in my hand with some new emotions in my heart"

1382
01:23:53,636 --> 01:23:58,817
"From the day I have seen you....."

1383
01:23:58,817 --> 01:24:08,855
"....I feel like you are written in my fate"

1384
01:24:08,855 --> 01:24:13,407
"Since the day I have liked you...."

1385
01:24:13,407 --> 01:24:19,231
".....you bring happiness along"

1386
01:24:19,231 --> 01:24:24,137
"I see happiness all around me"

1387
01:24:24,137 --> 01:24:34,141
"If this remains forever, what else I want"

1388
01:24:34,141 --> 01:25:09,573
"Your hand in my hand with some new emotions in my heart"

1389
01:25:09,573 --> 01:25:14,652
"The day we get married...."

1390
01:25:14,652 --> 01:25:24,889
".....our pair will look marvelous"

1391
01:25:24,889 --> 01:25:30,054
"Our dreams will come true"

1392
01:25:30,054 --> 01:25:35,183
........

1393
01:25:35,183 --> 01:25:40,025
"The sun and the stars have no comparison with you"

1394
01:25:40,025 --> 01:25:52,303
"If this remains forever, what else I want"

1395
01:25:52,303 --> 01:26:25,166
"Your hand in my hand with some new emotions in my heart"

1396
01:26:25,166 --> 01:26:30,265
"You have a beautiful face"

1397
01:26:30,265 --> 01:26:40,355
"Anyone can loose his trust"

1398
01:26:40,355 --> 01:26:45,325
"I saw your intoxicated eyes and...."

1399
01:26:45,325 --> 01:26:50,309
".....since then I have lost control over my heart"

1400
01:26:50,309 --> 01:26:56,996
"I lost myself and got you, that is written in my fate"

1401
01:26:56,996 --> 01:27:06,347
"If this remains forever, what else I want"

1402
01:27:06,347 --> 01:29:10,416
"Your hand in my hand with some new emotions in my heart"

1403
01:29:10,416 --> 01:29:13,663
Father, where is Champa?

1404
01:29:13,663 --> 01:29:14,908
She went to the fair.

1405
01:29:14,908 --> 01:29:16,356
She went with me....

1406
01:29:16,356 --> 01:29:19,003
...but she ditched me in the fair and was with her beloved.

1407
01:29:19,003 --> 01:29:20,288
What nonsense!

1408
01:29:20,288 --> 01:29:21,277
Yes!

1409
01:29:21,277 --> 01:29:22,715
You know it very well.......

1410
01:29:22,715 --> 01:29:27,005
...your Champa has an affair with that guy!

1411
01:29:27,005 --> 01:29:28,079
Dont shout.

1412
01:29:28,079 --> 01:29:30,797
I will pull your tongue otherwise!

1413
01:29:30,797 --> 01:29:32,979
You blame my innocent daughter!

1414
01:29:32,979 --> 01:29:34,808
Is she your daughter?

1415
01:29:34,808 --> 01:29:36,013
Anyway whoever's daughter she is....

1416
01:29:36,013 --> 01:29:38,055
.....I just know one thing......

1417
01:29:38,055 --> 01:29:41,074
....if you dont get her married to me.....

1418
01:29:41,074 --> 01:29:44,052
....I will nab her!

1419
01:29:44,052 --> 01:29:45,132
Think!

1420
01:29:45,132 --> 01:29:48,231
No one can hold grudges against me.....

1421
01:29:48,231 --> 01:29:50,948
.....and you cant take the help of police.

1422
01:29:50,948 --> 01:29:53,227
Why? Because you know the reason.

1423
01:29:53,227 --> 01:29:54,232
Understood?

1424
01:29:54,232 --> 01:30:00,987
I will come back again!

1425
01:30:00,987 --> 01:30:02,195
Barkha!

1426
01:30:02,195 --> 01:30:03,000
Barkha!

1427
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:04,559
Mohan Sir you?

1428
01:30:04,559 --> 01:30:06,518
Give me some more time!

1429
01:30:06,518 --> 01:30:08,618
I will pay off your debt!

1430
01:30:08,618 --> 01:30:09,714
I excuse you!
What?

1431
01:30:09,714 --> 01:30:11,633
I will give you 100 rupees more.....

1432
01:30:11,633 --> 01:30:15,227
.....if you find out Champa's parents!

1433
01:30:15,227 --> 01:30:15,796
Champa?

1434
01:30:15,796 --> 01:30:16,252
Yes!

1435
01:30:16,252 --> 01:30:19,048
You were sloshed and in that state you said
Champa is not his daughter

1436
01:30:19,048 --> 01:30:21,733
It is very old.

1437
01:30:21,733 --> 01:30:24,054
When Dinu used to drink some years back......

1438
01:30:24,054 --> 01:30:26,762
.....even he said it by mistake.

1439
01:30:26,762 --> 01:30:30,091
But he never told me anything further!

1440
01:30:30,091 --> 01:30:32,832
Dont tell him I am here!

1441
01:30:32,832 --> 01:30:34,506
Come in.

1442
01:30:34,506 --> 01:30:36,296
Come in.

1443
01:30:36,296 --> 01:30:38,893
At this time you are here?

1444
01:30:38,893 --> 01:30:40,554
Mohan had come home sometime back.

1445
01:30:40,554 --> 01:30:43,015
He wants to get married to Champa

1446
01:30:43,015 --> 01:30:44,292
Thats good.

1447
01:30:44,292 --> 01:30:45,604
He is rich.

1448
01:30:45,604 --> 01:30:46,921
He has some reputation.

1449
01:30:46,921 --> 01:30:47,902
No!

1450
01:30:47,902 --> 01:30:49,549
Champa is not worth him.

1451
01:30:49,549 --> 01:30:51,973
You talk like she comes from an affluent family.

1452
01:30:51,973 --> 01:30:54,597
Champa is a wealthy man's daughter.

1453
01:30:54,597 --> 01:30:56,772
I havent told this to anyone.

1454
01:30:56,772 --> 01:30:58,648
I dont want....

1455
01:30:58,648 --> 01:31:00,494
....someone takes Champa away from me.

1456
01:31:00,494 --> 01:31:02,007
I wont be able to live without her.

1457
01:31:02,007 --> 01:31:04,471
Mohan intimidated me.....

1458
01:31:04,471 --> 01:31:06,711
....so I had to come to you

1459
01:31:06,711 --> 01:31:08,622
Everyone is scared of Mohan.

1460
01:31:08,622 --> 01:31:11,013
Do you know how dangerous is he?

1461
01:31:11,013 --> 01:31:13,058
If he wants to get married to Champa he will do so!

1462
01:31:13,058 --> 01:31:14,354
I will give up on my life.....

1463
01:31:14,354 --> 01:31:18,027
.....but you wont be able to stop him.

1464
01:31:18,027 --> 01:31:21,937
Promise me, if anything happens to me.......

1465
01:31:21,937 --> 01:31:24,818
.....you will hand her over to her family!

1466
01:31:24,818 --> 01:31:26,313
But where?

1467
01:31:26,313 --> 01:31:29,371
You wont tell anybody, right?

1468
01:31:29,371 --> 01:31:30,435
Are you mad?

1469
01:31:30,435 --> 01:31:32,594
You are my old friend!

1470
01:31:32,594 --> 01:31:33,061
Listen!

1471
01:31:33,061 --> 01:31:38,006
There is a yellow voluminous bungalow at
Srinagar near the Lake!

1472
01:31:38,006 --> 01:31:41,063
I mean it was there some 20 years ago.

1473
01:31:41,063 --> 01:31:42,898
Its still there!

1474
01:31:42,898 --> 01:31:45,006
I had nabbed Champa from there!

1475
01:31:45,006 --> 01:31:45,964
Robbed her?

1476
01:31:45,964 --> 01:31:47,074
Yes!

1477
01:31:47,074 --> 01:31:50,234
She is a daughter of a tycoon of Delhi.

1478
01:31:50,234 --> 01:31:53,732
My sister used to work there.

1479
01:31:53,732 --> 01:31:55,009
What is his name?

1480
01:31:55,009 --> 01:31:57,839
His name is...

1481
01:31:57,839 --> 01:32:02,626
Barcha, is there anyone in the room, apart from us?

1482
01:32:02,626 --> 01:32:04,465
No one is there!

1483
01:32:04,465 --> 01:32:05,842
Definitely there is someone in the room!

1484
01:32:05,842 --> 01:32:07,693

1535
01:34:06,095 --> 01:34:10,313
A bucket of cold water!

1536
01:34:10,313 --> 01:34:12,376
I had decided that very moment....

1537
01:34:12,376 --> 01:34:14,306

1541
01:34:21,998 --> 01:34:26,758

01:34:26,758 --> 01:34:27,715
...what will you say?

1543
01:34:27,715 --> 01:34:32,687

Let me go.

1548
01:34:39,663 --> 01:34:40,761
No!

1549
01:34:40,761 --> 01:34:42,481
When I hold someone.....

1550
01:34:42,481 --> 01:34:44,861
....he doesnt leave her easily.

1551
01:34:44,861 --> 01:34:47,043
And how can you trust someone who is mad?

1552
01:34:47,043 --> 01:34:49,486
Sometimes I even bite.

1553
01:34:49,486 --> 01:34:50,612
Move.

1554
01:34:50,612 --> 01:34:52,792

You, me!

Even I am leaving.

1563
01:35:08,903 --> 01:35:43,687
You are loosing your mind.

1564
01:35:43,687 --> 01:35:48,012
"After seeing this, my heart is filled with happiness"

1565
01:35:48,012 --> 01:35:52,896
"Love stretches itself"

1566
01:35:52,896 --> 01:35:57,315

"I became crazy just like a cloud"

1571
01:36:34,076 --> 01:36:39,352
"My luck was never like this"

1572
01:36:39,352 --> 01:36:46,282

1583
01:37:53,217 --> 01:38:00,011
".....I started liking you"

1584
01:38:00,011 --> 01:38:06,979
"I washed away like dew"

1585
01:38:06,979 --> 01:38:11,655
"I washed away like dew"

1586
01:38:11,655 --> 01:38:16,075

1593
01:39:02,033 --> 01:39:06,956
"Today with all new hopes....."

Who will bestow your daughter if you are jailed?

1634
01:41:54,792 --> 01:41:56,056

You look more beautiful when you are angry!

1639
01:42:03,761 --> 01:42:05,024

01:42:11,355 --> 01:42:13,896
And I will be the groom!

1644
01:42:13,896 --> 01:42:15,042

You seem to be worried.

1653
01:42:38,009 --> 01:42:41,985
I was thinking.....

1654
01:42:41,985 --> 01:42:44,985
...to get you married.

1655
01:42:44,985 --> 01:42:46,022
Father!

1656
01:42:46,022 --> 01:42:47,904
You want to remove me from your house?

1657
01:42:47,904 --> 01:42:48,933
No child!

1664
01:43:02,913 --> 01:43:04,233

1665
01:43:04,233 --> 01:43:06,293
He wants to get married to you.

1666
01:43:06,293 --> 01:43:07,844
He is very rich.

1667
01:43:07,844 --> 01:43:09,718
Father!

1668
01:43:09,718 --> 01:43:11,789
You will sell your daughter in greed?

1669
01:43:11,789 --> 01:43:13,465
Champa.

1670
01:43:13,465 --> 01:43:14,824
Dont ever say this.

1671
01:43:14,824 --> 01:43:17,061
Dont ever say this again!

1672
01:43:17,061 --> 01:43:19,896
If you force me to get married to Mohan
its equal to killing me!

1673
01:43:19,896 --> 01:43:21,006
Champa!

1674
01:43:21,006 --> 01:43:22,668
Instead I will have poison!

1675
01:43:22,668 --> 01:43:24,483
My daughter!

1676
01:43:24,483 --> 01:43:26,329
Dont do this.

1677
01:43:26,329 --> 01:43:29,651
I was not in my senses!

1678
01:43:29,651 --> 01:43:32,931
I wont get scared of his threats!

1679
01:43:32,931 --> 01:43:34,045
Threats?

1680
01:43:34,045 --> 01:43:35,677
Nothing.

1681
01:43:35,677 --> 01:43:38,384
Nothing.

1682
01:43:38,384 --> 01:43:39,934
You have taken a loan...

1683
01:43:39,934 --> 01:43:41,034
....that is the thing right?

1684
01:43:41,034 --> 01:43:42,007
How many rupees have you taken from him?

1685
01:43:42,007 --> 01:43:44,422
I will take it from Raju.

1686
01:43:44,422 --> 01:43:45,729
Raju?

1687
01:43:45,729 --> 01:43:47,267
Who is he?

1688
01:43:47,267 --> 01:43:49,677
That driver...!

1689
01:43:49,677 --> 01:43:52,727
The one who had given you 20 rupees?

1690
01:43:52,727 --> 01:43:54,024
He is a very nice man.

1691
01:43:54,024 --> 01:43:58,468
Do you trust him so much?

1692
01:43:58,468 --> 01:43:59,587
Yes!

1693
01:43:59,587 --> 01:44:00,832
I want to meet him.

1694
01:44:00,832 --> 01:44:03,652
Even Raju wants to meet you!

1695
01:44:03,652 --> 01:44:06,419
Call him tomorrow.

1696
01:44:06,419 --> 01:44:07,692
If you like him....

1697
01:44:07,692 --> 01:44:14,985
...I will fix you both!

1698
01:44:14,985 --> 01:44:17,059
Champakali....

1699
01:44:17,059 --> 01:44:19,655
...singing and swaying, where are you off to?

1700
01:44:19,655 --> 01:44:22,692
Beloved's place?

1701
01:44:22,692 --> 01:44:23,895
Go!

1702
01:44:23,895 --> 01:44:24,533
We wont go!

1703
01:44:24,533 --> 01:44:27,962
You are going to meet him or have already met him!

1704
01:44:27,962 --> 01:44:29,265
I am going to meet him.

1705
01:44:29,265 --> 01:44:32,248
Something important?

1706
01:44:32,248 --> 01:44:34,713
Tell us what is it?

1707
01:44:34,713 --> 01:44:38,162
My father is convinced.

1708
01:44:38,162 --> 01:44:39,746
He wants to meet Raju.

1709
01:44:39,746 --> 01:44:59,465
Why dont you accept you want to meet him?

1710
01:44:59,465 --> 01:45:01,456
You?

1711
01:45:01,456 --> 01:45:03,028
Is your boss at home?

1712
01:45:03,028 --> 01:45:12,998
No Why?

1713
01:45:12,998 --> 01:45:18,075
Why did you close the door?

1714
01:45:18,075 --> 01:45:19,979
Because I want to talk!

1715
01:45:19,979 --> 01:45:22,158
What?

1716
01:45:22,158 --> 01:45:23,205
Come!

1717
01:45:23,205 --> 01:45:25,437
What is it?

1718
01:45:25,437 --> 01:45:26,051
Sit!

1719
01:45:26,051 --> 01:45:27,243
What is it?

1720
01:45:27,243 --> 01:45:28,365
Sit first.

1721
01:45:28,365 --> 01:45:31,753
What is it?

1722
01:45:31,753 --> 01:45:33,008
My father was saying..

1723
01:45:33,008 --> 01:45:34,684
....you are a very nice man.

1724
01:45:34,684 --> 01:45:35,932
Thats it?

1725
01:45:35,932 --> 01:45:37,118
This was it?

1726
01:45:37,118 --> 01:45:38,014
Why?

1727
01:45:38,014 --> 01:45:39,692
Is it not important?

1728
01:45:39,692 --> 01:45:42,786
What if my father disliked you?

1729
01:45:42,786 --> 01:45:45,059
How would we get married?

1730
01:45:45,059 --> 01:45:47,115
Where are we married?

1731
01:45:47,115 --> 01:45:49,662
If we arent married we will soon get married.

1732
01:45:49,662 --> 01:45:51,074
He wants to fix us up!

1733
01:45:51,074 --> 01:45:53,006
Let me have a word with you first!

1734
01:45:53,006 --> 01:45:58,483
Give me your hand!

1735
01:45:58,483 --> 01:46:00,937
What is this?

1736
01:46:00,937 --> 01:46:04,703
A sign of getting married!

1737
01:46:04,703 --> 01:46:07,076
If anyone wants to get married to you, show them this ring!

1738
01:46:07,076 --> 01:46:12,907
I will show them my thumb instead!

1739
01:46:12,907 --> 01:46:14,103
Tell me..

1740
01:46:14,103 --> 01:46:17,056
....girls dont take their husbands name after their wedding!

1741
01:46:17,056 --> 01:46:24,339
What will you call me as?

1742
01:46:24,339 --> 01:46:31,302
Eji!

1743
01:46:31,302 --> 01:46:36,789
Eji!
Yes!

1744
01:46:36,789 --> 01:46:38,044
Your boss has come!

1745
01:46:38,044 --> 01:46:39,932
Boss?

1746
01:46:39,932 --> 01:46:45,835
My boss would have come!
Hide somewhere!

1747
01:46:45,835 --> 01:46:59,397
You hide here I will see whose on the door!

1748
01:46:59,397 --> 01:47:00,688
Can I come inside?

1749
01:47:00,688 --> 01:47:02,553
No!

1750
01:47:02,553 --> 01:47:05,517
There is no need for you to act like a maniac!

1751
01:47:05,517 --> 01:47:08,392
I know you are Sir Rajeevlal!

1752
01:47:08,392 --> 01:47:12,076
Me?

1753
01:47:12,076 --> 01:47:14,301
Dont act!

1754
01:47:14,301 --> 01:47:14,924
I know it all.

1755
01:47:14,924 --> 01:47:16,912
Your friend has told me everything.

1756
01:47:16,912 --> 01:47:18,479
Chandar told you everything?

1757
01:47:18,479 --> 01:47:19,175
Yes!

1758
01:47:19,175 --> 01:47:20,798
Be a little soft!

1759
01:47:20,798 --> 01:47:21,535
Who will hear?

1760
01:47:21,535 --> 01:47:23,541
No one is here except us!

1761
01:47:23,541 --> 01:47:25,335
Rekha!

1762
01:47:25,335 --> 01:47:28,358
Maya has come I will hide here!

1763
01:47:28,358 --> 01:47:32,476
Not there!

1764
01:47:32,476 --> 01:47:34,263
Rekha!

1765
01:47:34,263 --> 01:47:36,103
Hello!
Hello!

1766
01:47:36,103 --> 01:47:37,462
Is Rekha here?

1767
01:47:37,462 --> 01:47:39,024
Why?

1768
01:47:39,024 --> 01:47:41,341
Be careful!

1769
01:47:41,341 --> 01:47:42,908
She is a very cunning girl!

1770
01:47:42,908 --> 01:47:44,396
And you?

1771
01:47:44,396 --> 01:47:47,152
I left it on you!

1772
01:47:47,152 --> 01:47:50,639
You tested me by saying you are mad!

1773
01:47:50,639 --> 01:47:55,066
You must have understood Rekha and
Chhaya are not good girls!

1774
01:47:55,066 --> 01:47:55,657
Yes!

1775
01:47:55,657 --> 01:47:56,607
Maya!

1776
01:47:56,607 --> 01:47:57,312
Chhaya!

1777
01:47:57,312 --> 01:47:58,478
I will hide somewhere!

1778
01:47:58,478 --> 01:48:03,716
Even you hide behind the sofa.

1779
01:48:03,716 --> 01:48:04,619
You?

1780
01:48:04,619 --> 01:48:07,374
I was waiting for you.

1781
01:48:07,374 --> 01:48:08,323
Seriously?

1782
01:48:08,323 --> 01:48:10,114
Yes!

1783
01:48:10,114 --> 01:48:13,442
You like me more than Maya and Chhaya?

1784
01:48:13,442 --> 01:48:15,012
No doubt in it!

1785
01:48:15,012 --> 01:48:17,553
I like you the most.

1786
01:48:17,553 --> 01:48:21,448
You drive me crazy!

1787
01:48:21,448 --> 01:48:23,475
You will marry me?

1788
01:48:23,475 --> 01:48:24,063
What are you asking me an obvious question?

1789
01:48:24,063 --> 01:48:26,358
I will obviously marry you!

1790
01:48:26,358 --> 01:48:28,351
But there is a problem.

1791
01:48:28,351 --> 01:48:29,193
What?

1792
01:48:29,193 --> 01:48:33,302
Your friends Rekha and Maya also like me!

1793
01:48:33,302 --> 01:48:36,015
They love your money.

1794
01:48:36,015 --> 01:48:38,915
And I just love you.

1795
01:48:38,915 --> 01:48:40,497
Even they say the same!

1796
01:48:40,497 --> 01:48:41,028
They lie.

1797
01:48:41,028 --> 01:48:42,877
Okay lets decide.

1798
01:48:42,877 --> 01:48:44,109
Co incidentally even they are here.

1799
01:48:44,109 --> 01:48:45,216
Come!

1800
01:48:45,216 --> 01:48:47,663
Please come out.

1801
01:48:47,663 --> 01:48:49,699
Please even you.

1802
01:48:49,699 --> 01:48:50,926
Liar, Dishonest!

1803
01:48:50,926 --> 01:48:52,457
Cunning, Cruel!

1804
01:48:52,457 --> 01:48:54,052
What are you?

1805
01:48:54,052 --> 01:48:56,182
What all things you told about me?
She said!

1806
01:48:56,182 --> 01:48:58,712
Shut up.

1807
01:48:58,712 --> 01:48:59,727
Do you know?

1808
01:48:59,727 --> 01:49:01,561
What have I decided?

1809
01:49:01,561 --> 01:49:02,015
What?

1810
01:49:02,015 --> 01:49:05,167
If you 3 dont leave this house I will get you arrested!

1811
01:49:05,167 --> 01:49:07,279
Our boyfriend was better than him.

1812
01:49:07,279 --> 01:49:08,238
Yes!

1813
01:49:08,238 --> 01:49:09,862
Why dont you get married to him?

1814
01:49:09,862 --> 01:49:11,589
They dont have money.

1815
01:49:11,589 --> 01:49:42,091
Take money from me and please leave me alone.

1816
01:49:42,091 --> 01:49:47,294
Yes Yes!

1817
01:49:47,294 --> 01:49:48,989
Champa!
Sir!

1818
01:49:48,989 --> 01:49:50,476
Ranima has called.

1819
01:49:50,476 --> 01:49:56,003
She sounds worried

1820
01:49:56,003 --> 01:49:57,361
Hello!

1821
01:49:57,361 --> 01:50:00,053
Yes mother!

1822
01:50:00,053 --> 01:50:02,083
What?

1823
01:50:02,083 --> 01:50:02,979
Okay.

1824
01:50:02,979 --> 01:50:04,049
Yes mother!

1825
01:50:04,049 --> 01:50:06,983
I am coming.

1826
01:50:06,983 --> 01:50:07,725
I will have to go.

1827
01:50:07,725 --> 01:50:10,159
I will book your tickets and will pack your luggage!

1828
01:50:10,159 --> 01:50:11,391
What about Champa?

1829
01:50:11,391 --> 01:50:29,463
I will explain Champa.

1830
01:50:29,463 --> 01:50:30,738
Raju?

1831
01:50:30,738 --> 01:50:32,897
He will be here anytime.

1832
01:50:32,897 --> 01:50:35,025
I wish...

1833
01:50:35,025 --> 01:50:37,164
....I see him.

1834
01:50:37,164 --> 01:50:39,291
Dont say this Karuna!

1835
01:50:39,291 --> 01:50:42,075
Shaamlalji will get a doctor with him!

1836
01:50:42,075 --> 01:50:52,367
The doctor also cant do anything.

1837
01:50:52,367 --> 01:50:52,993
Mother!

1838
01:50:52,993 --> 01:50:54,234
Raju.

1839
01:50:54,234 --> 01:50:55,641
You have come?

1840
01:50:55,641 --> 01:50:56,674
Raju!
Karuna!

1841
01:50:56,674 --> 01:50:57,062
You have come?

1842
01:50:57,062 --> 01:50:59,211
Dont get up!

1843
01:50:59,211 --> 01:50:59,779
Lie down!

1844
01:50:59,779 --> 01:51:01,003
What happen to her?

1845
01:51:01,003 --> 01:51:02,897
Pneumonia

1846
01:51:02,897 --> 01:51:05,127
Raju!

1847
01:51:05,127 --> 01:51:06,087
Good you came!

1848
01:51:06,087 --> 01:51:09,469
Now I can die peacefully.

1849
01:51:09,469 --> 01:51:10,166
Dont say this.

1850
01:51:10,166 --> 01:51:12,134
Take rest!

1851
01:51:12,134 --> 01:51:13,174
Raju.

1852
01:51:13,174 --> 01:51:16,856
Let me speak.

1853
01:51:16,856 --> 01:51:19,426
I will never get a chance!

1854
01:51:19,426 --> 01:51:22,507
Raju!

1855
01:51:22,507 --> 01:51:29,402
You are not Ranima's son!
Karuna!

1856
01:51:29,402 --> 01:51:31,322
Ranima!

1857
01:51:31,322 --> 01:51:33,093
Let me speak.

1858
01:51:33,093 --> 01:51:35,551
Else!

1859
01:51:35,551 --> 01:51:41,688
My soul won’t rest in peace.

1860
01:51:41,688 --> 01:51:46,568
I have a brother in Shimla!

1861
01:51:46,568 --> 01:51:48,863
Dinu!

1862
01:51:48,863 --> 01:52:08,879
He was a drunkard.

1863
01:52:08,879 --> 01:52:09,399
What happen?

1864
01:52:09,399 --> 01:52:13,432
I am hungry.

1865
01:52:13,432 --> 01:52:15,661
Shut up!
You wont get anything.

1866
01:52:15,661 --> 01:52:23,485
I am hungry!

1867
01:52:23,485 --> 01:52:25,129
What is this brother?

1868
01:52:25,129 --> 01:52:26,927
You will kill him?

1869
01:52:26,927 --> 01:52:27,942
Yes!

1870
01:52:27,942 --> 01:52:30,548
He keeps asking for food all the time.

1871
01:52:30,548 --> 01:52:31,756
Arent you ashamed?

1872
01:52:31,756 --> 01:52:33,148
You can spend money on alcohol.....

1873
01:52:33,148 --> 01:52:38,551
...but you cant feed him?

1874
01:52:38,551 --> 01:52:40,062
I dont want a son.

1875
01:52:40,062 --> 01:52:49,221
I dont want.

1876
01:52:49,221 --> 01:52:52,023
I can even sell him for alcohol!

1877
01:52:52,023 --> 01:52:53,785
For how much?

1878
01:52:53,785 --> 01:52:55,003
What?

1879
01:52:55,003 --> 01:52:57,025
Ranima had come home!

1880
01:52:57,025 --> 01:52:58,849
I will take him there.

1881
01:52:58,849 --> 01:53:00,334
If she likes him.....

1882
01:53:00,334 --> 01:53:02,302
...she will keep him.

1883
01:53:02,302 --> 01:53:10,971
Take him away.

1884
01:53:10,971 --> 01:53:13,531
You grew up here!

1885
01:53:13,531 --> 01:53:15,071
And Dinu.....

1886
01:53:15,071 --> 01:53:19,549
......spent all his money on alcohol.

1887
01:53:19,549 --> 01:53:21,797
He came back again to ask for money.

1888
01:53:21,797 --> 01:53:24,292
And then....

1889
01:53:24,292 --> 01:53:30,018
...one day!

1890
01:53:30,018 --> 01:53:33,016
You came back again?

1891
01:53:33,016 --> 01:53:35,834
I wont give you a single penny!

1892
01:53:35,834 --> 01:53:36,423
Where is he?

1893
01:53:36,423 --> 01:53:37,976
Who?

1894
01:53:37,976 --> 01:53:40,675
Raju!

1895
01:53:40,675 --> 01:53:43,726
You can take him just now.

1896
01:53:43,726 --> 01:53:45,479
What do you mean?

1897
01:53:45,479 --> 01:53:48,881
With God's blessings, Ranima is going to be a mother!

1898
01:53:48,881 --> 01:53:50,815
She is going to be a mother?

1899
01:53:50,815 --> 01:53:52,829
Raju has vacations...

1900
01:53:52,829 --> 01:53:56,751
....I was going to Kashmir taking him to meet Ranima!

1901
01:53:56,751 --> 01:53:57,304
Yes

1902
01:53:57,304 --> 01:53:58,714
I am calling him!

1903
01:53:58,714 --> 01:54:00,007
If you want take him away.

1904
01:54:00,007 --> 01:54:00,894
No!

1905
01:54:00,894 --> 01:54:04,911
He will stay here only

1906
01:54:04,911 --> 01:54:08,108
He will always stay here.

1907
01:54:08,108 --> 01:54:16,509
Only my son can be the owner of this property.

1908
01:54:16,509 --> 01:54:28,365
Understood?

1909
01:54:28,365 --> 01:54:31,736
The day Ranima's daughter took a birth...

1910
01:54:31,736 --> 01:54:33,918
...she was unconscious.

1911
01:54:33,918 --> 01:54:35,078
The doctor said….

1912
01:54:35,078 --> 01:54:39,687
....she wont come back to her senses for a day!

1913
01:54:39,687 --> 01:54:40,985
That very day...

1914
01:54:40,985 --> 01:54:43,459
...it was a dangerous stormy night!

1915
01:54:43,459 --> 01:54:44,451
I was in one room.

1916
01:54:44,451 --> 01:54:46,074
I was making....

1917
01:54:46,074 --> 01:55:18,634
....the baby sleep!

1918
01:55:18,634 --> 01:55:22,811
Brother!

1919
01:55:22,811 --> 01:55:24,495

1920
01:55:24,495 --> 01:55:25,438

1921
01:55:25,438 --> 01:55:26,858

01:55:26,858 --> 01:55:28,727

1923
01:55:28,727 --> 01:55:29,056

My daughter is alive?

1930
01:56:15,744 --> 01:56:17,304
I am not Ranima's son

1931
01:56:17,304 --> 01:56:20,577

1932
01:56:20,577 --> 01:56:22,093

1935
01:56:25,617 --> 01:56:28,258

01:56:31,884 --> 01:56:33,407
I am not Ranima's son

1939
01:56:33,407 --> 01:56:34,795
I dont belong to this house?

1940
01:56:34,795 --> 01:56:36,367
I dont belong to this house?

1941
01:56:36,367 --> 01:57:26,088
I dont belong to this house?

1942
01:57:26,088 --> 01:57:27,281
Good evening Sir!

1943
01:57:27,281 --> 01:57:29,338
I am Rajeev!

1944
01:57:29,338 --> 01:57:30,799
I am not your boss!

1945
01:57:30,799 --> 01:57:31,512
But I...!

1946
01:57:31,512 --> 01:57:46,462
Dont call me Sir else I will think you are abusing me!

1947
01:57:46,462 --> 01:57:49,822

1948
01:57:49,822 --> 01:58:58,452

1949
01:58:58,452 --> 01:59:01,811
Now you feel the need?

1950
01:59:01,811 --> 01:59:09,514
Now you will get addicted to it.

1951
01:59:09,514 --> 01:59:11,913
Colonel!

1952
01:59:11,913 --> 01:59:16,478
The one who looses in a war....

1953
01:59:16,478 --> 01:59:19,356
....what is his condition?

1954
01:59:19,356 --> 01:59:23,079
He gathers his troops...

1955
01:59:23,079 --> 01:59:27,395
...and he again fights!

1956
01:59:27,395 --> 01:59:31,249
And the one who has lost hopes?

1957
01:59:31,249 --> 01:59:38,824
Why will he live if he left alone in this world?

1958
01:59:38,824 --> 01:59:41,818
Lives to love!

1959
01:59:41,818 --> 01:59:44,871
For his love!

1960
01:59:44,871 --> 01:59:50,901

1989
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:37,347
Raju!

1990
02:04:37,347 --> 02:04:41,089
What is this?

1991
02:04:41,089 --> 02:04:42,235
I am going.

1992
02:04:42,235 --> 02:04:43,205
You are going?

1993
02:04:43,205 --> 02:04:44,498
Where?

1994
02:04:44,498 --> 02:04:47,079
Why are you going?

1995
02:04:47,079 --> 02:04:50,496
You have many favours on me!

1996
02:04:50,496 --> 02:04:52,624
How much indebted I am to you.

1997
02:04:52,624 --> 02:04:54,741
Indebted?

What favour are you talking about?

1999
02:04:56,115 --> 02:04:58,271
What are you saying, son?

2000
02:04:58,271 --> 02:04:59,804
Son?

2001
02:04:59,804 --> 02:05:03,031
Even after knowing everything still you call me your son?

2002
02:05:03,031 --> 02:05:08,094
You are a God for me and not just a woman.

2003
02:05:08,094 --> 02:05:10,158
Raju!

2004
02:05:10,158 --> 02:05:13,756
Son!

2005
02:05:13,756 --> 02:05:16,034
I wish I could forget I am a son......

2006
02:05:16,034 --> 02:05:20,249
....of a father who has sold me for money!

2007
02:05:20,249 --> 02:05:24,814
To make me the heir to this family,
he walk over humanity and decency

2008
02:05:24,814 --> 02:05:25,914
No son!

2009
02:05:25,914 --> 02:05:28,024
I have no complaints!

2010
02:05:28,024 --> 02:05:30,972
I am satisfied in what I have!

2011
02:05:30,972 --> 02:05:32,751
What was taken away from me....

2012
02:05:32,751 --> 02:05:34,726
.....was not in my fate!

2013
02:05:34,726 --> 02:05:36,068
Ranima, I forgot informing you....

2014
02:05:36,068 --> 02:05:38,497
...the day Karuna fell ill....

2015
02:05:38,497 --> 02:05:40,511
....someone had come to meet him.

2016
02:05:40,511 --> 02:05:41,704
One man?

2017
02:05:41,704 --> 02:05:43,012
Who was he?

2018
02:05:43,012 --> 02:05:44,506
His name or address?

2019
02:05:44,506 --> 02:05:46,004
I dont know anything.

2020
02:05:46,004 --> 02:05:48,779
But from his appearance, Karuna said....

2021
02:05:48,779 --> 02:05:51,116
.....he must be living in some mountainous area!

2022
02:05:51,116 --> 02:05:53,932
I believe he is alive!

2023
02:05:53,932 --> 02:05:56,852
I will find him from any corner of the world.

2024
02:05:56,852 --> 02:05:57,581
Bless me!

2025
02:05:57,581 --> 02:05:59,481
I will also come with you.

2026

As you wish.

2027

You have come here after 20 long years.

2028
02:06:11,908 --> 02:06:13,058
Greetings Ranima!

2029
02:06:13,058 --> 02:06:14,294

I am leaving now!
Chandar and Bholaraam will take care of you!

2031
02:06:16,956 --> 02:06:18,439
She doesn’t need anyone!

2032
02:06:18,439 --> 02:06:20,408
I am here to serve her.

2033
02:06:20,408 --> 02:06:20,883
You?

2034
02:06:20,883 --> 02:06:22,814
She is my wife!

2035
02:06:22,814 --> 02:06:25,075
Day before yesterday, we got married.

2036
02:06:25,075 --> 02:06:25,922
I am leaving.

2037
02:06:25,922 --> 02:06:28,168
Rest for sometime, we have just reached.

2038
02:06:28,168 --> 02:06:29,334

2039
02:06:29,334 --> 02:06:31,744
I cant even wait for a minute!

2040
02:06:31,744 --> 02:06:33,947
Chandar take care of her!

2041
02:06:33,947 --> 02:06:35,581
Sir!

2042
02:06:35,581 --> 02:06:37,649
Come Ranima!

2043
02:06:37,649 --> 02:06:39,396
Sir!

2044
02:06:39,396 --> 02:06:42,605
I tried finding Champa after you left....

2045
02:06:42,605 --> 02:06:53,555
.....but she never came to the market to sell flowers!

2046
02:06:53,555 --> 02:07:00,723
Champa!

2047
02:07:00,723 --> 02:07:04,236
Champa

2048
02:07:04,236 --> 02:07:06,228
You want flowers, sir?

2049
02:07:06,228 --> 02:07:07,887
5 rupees for a basket.

2050
02:07:07,887 --> 02:07:11,106
5 rupees is of no value to you, right Sir?

2051
02:07:11,106 --> 02:07:12,913
Buy them.

2052
02:07:12,913 --> 02:07:14,153
Champa!

2053
02:07:14,153 --> 02:07:17,716
I dint get a chance to talk to you that day.

2054
02:07:17,716 --> 02:07:20,092
What is the need to say?

2055
02:07:20,092 --> 02:07:21,968
To play with a girl's emotions...

2056
02:07:21,968 --> 02:07:28,259
.....and her feelings must be your habit!

2057
02:07:28,259 --> 02:07:29,743
Champa I am not a wealthy person!

2058
02:07:29,743 --> 02:07:31,391
I am a common man!

2059
02:07:31,391 --> 02:07:34,215
I want to clear your misconception.

2060
02:07:34,215 --> 02:07:35,946
It was cleared that very day!

2061
02:07:35,946 --> 02:07:37,753
When I saw the real you.

2062
02:07:37,753 --> 02:07:40,187
Champa!

2063
02:07:40,187 --> 02:07:42,973
Arent you contended by ditching me once?

2064
02:07:42,973 --> 02:07:44,908
That you have again come?

2065
02:07:44,908 --> 02:07:45,778
Champa!

2066
02:07:45,778 --> 02:08:06,247
Champa please wait.

2067
02:08:06,247 --> 02:08:08,462
You dint go to the market?

2068
02:08:08,462 --> 02:08:10,054
I just picked flowers!

2069
02:08:10,054 --> 02:08:12,044
I will go now.

2070
02:08:12,044 --> 02:08:16,208
Now, you dont have to earn a living!

2071
02:08:16,208 --> 02:08:18,108
Why?

2072
02:08:18,108 --> 02:08:20,771
Mohan had come home after you left!

2073
02:08:20,771 --> 02:08:22,112
Mohan?

2074
02:08:22,112 --> 02:08:24,236
Yes!

2075
02:08:24,236 --> 02:08:27,111
Like others Mohan would have ditched us.....

2076
02:08:27,111 --> 02:08:30,153
...but he was always good to us!

2077
02:08:30,153 --> 02:08:32,693
He has even helped us monetarily!

2078
02:08:32,693 --> 02:08:35,852
He is our well wisher!

2079
02:08:35,852 --> 02:08:38,059
What do you mean, father?

2080
02:08:38,059 --> 02:08:44,348
He wants to get married to you.

2081
02:08:44,348 --> 02:08:45,078
Marriage?

2082
02:08:45,078 --> 02:08:47,811
If I was not helpless...

2083
02:08:47,811 --> 02:08:50,488
....I would have searched for a better guy than him.

2084
02:08:50,488 --> 02:08:52,084
But what do I do?

2085
02:08:52,084 --> 02:08:53,541
I am blind!

2086
02:08:53,541 --> 02:08:55,083
I am helpless!

2087
02:08:55,083 --> 02:08:57,983
I am poor!

2088
02:08:57,983 --> 02:08:58,809
But father!

2089
02:08:58,809 --> 02:09:00,046
No child!

2090
02:09:00,046 --> 02:09:01,755
Now dont refuse!

2091
02:09:01,755 --> 02:09:03,585
Mohan is rich....

2092
02:09:03,585 --> 02:09:04,934
...is even reputed!

2093
02:09:04,934 --> 02:09:06,645
He will even keep you happy!

2094
02:09:06,645 --> 02:09:10,454
He has agreed to keep me with him in his house!

2095
02:09:10,454 --> 02:09:12,277
You will stay with me...

2096
02:09:12,277 --> 02:09:14,835
...you will look after me....

2097
02:09:14,835 --> 02:09:18,363
....I wont have to see bad days in my old age!

2098
02:09:18,363 --> 02:09:20,085
Father

2099
02:09:20,085 --> 02:09:22,773
Please dont cry!

2100
02:09:22,773 --> 02:09:26,122
We wont have to suffer anymore!

2101
02:09:26,122 --> 02:09:29,314
I will tell Mohan.....

2102
02:09:29,314 --> 02:09:31,941
....you are convinced for the wedding.

2103
02:09:31,941 --> 02:09:39,047
I am leaving.

2104
02:09:39,047 --> 02:09:40,416
Sir!

2105
02:09:40,416 --> 02:09:42,193
You had gone to find Ranima's daughter?

2106
02:09:42,193 --> 02:09:42,593
Why?

2107
02:09:42,593 --> 02:09:44,001
How do you know?

2108
02:09:44,001 --> 02:09:46,511
I dont know anything about it!
But Mohan had come here!

2109
02:09:46,511 --> 02:09:47,533
Who is Mohan?

2110
02:09:47,533 --> 02:09:49,555
The one who is in charge of the jungles?
Yes!

2111
02:09:49,555 --> 02:09:51,355
I thought he was drunk!

2112
02:09:51,355 --> 02:09:52,028
What was he saying?

2113
02:09:52,028 --> 02:09:56,319
He knows her daughter!

2114
02:09:56,319 --> 02:10:02,142
How does he know?

2115
02:10:02,142 --> 02:10:04,106
You are looking good, Sir Mohan!

2116
02:10:04,106 --> 02:10:06,932
The day you'll be the groom.....

2117
02:10:06,932 --> 02:10:08,987
.....that will be the day of your life!

2118
02:10:08,987 --> 02:10:11,472
3 days to go...!

2119
02:10:11,472 --> 02:10:13,796
I dont get sleep at night.

2120
02:10:13,796 --> 02:10:22,655
And even if I get sleep I only dream about Champa.

2121
02:10:22,655 --> 02:10:23,679
You?

2122
02:10:23,679 --> 02:10:27,919
How did you reach here?

2123
02:10:27,919 --> 02:10:29,786
I want to ask you something....

2124
02:10:29,786 --> 02:10:32,168
Regarding?

2125
02:10:32,168 --> 02:10:35,703
....about Ranima's daughter!

2126
02:10:35,703 --> 02:10:38,006
Who Ranima?

2127
02:10:38,006 --> 02:10:41,781
Whose address you had taken from Ranima and had gone to Delhi!

2128
02:10:41,781 --> 02:10:48,181
Who Bholaraam?

2129
02:10:48,181 --> 02:10:51,823
You had even spoken to Karuna
regarding Ranima's daughter!

2130
02:10:51,823 --> 02:10:53,273
Who is Karuna?

2131
02:10:53,273 --> 02:10:55,319
Mohan!

2132
02:10:55,319 --> 02:10:57,659
I have to find that girl.

2133
02:10:57,659 --> 02:11:00,198
Tell me who is she and where is she?

2134
02:11:00,198 --> 02:11:01,318
I am telling you!

2135
02:11:01,318 --> 02:11:09,242
Leave me!

2136
02:11:09,242 --> 02:11:13,002
I will tell you now!

2137
02:11:13,002 --> 02:11:21,648
Sir Mohan!

2138
02:11:21,648 --> 02:11:23,538
Tell him Sir!

2139
02:11:23,538 --> 02:11:24,593
Tell me who that girl is.

2140
02:11:24,593 --> 02:11:25,585
Tell him Sir.

2141
02:11:25,585 --> 02:11:26,075
Tell him!

2142
02:11:26,075 --> 02:11:27,938
Tell me who is that girl?

2143
02:11:27,938 --> 02:11:34,015
Blood!

2144
02:11:34,015 --> 02:11:35,944
What do you know?

2145
02:11:35,944 --> 02:11:37,283
I know everything.

2146
02:11:37,283 --> 02:11:38,379
Please dont hit me.

2147
02:11:38,379 --> 02:11:39,056
Who is that girl?

2148
02:11:39,056 --> 02:11:41,776
She is Dinu's daughter!

2149
02:11:41,776 --> 02:11:43,783
I know he had nabbed her!

2150
02:11:43,783 --> 02:11:45,209
Whom did he nab?

2151
02:11:45,209 --> 02:11:49,356
Champa!

2152
02:11:49,356 --> 02:11:50,354
Champa?

2153
02:11:50,354 --> 02:11:53,227
Yes!

2154
02:11:53,227 --> 02:12:05,642
Champa is that girl?
Yes!

2155
02:12:05,642 --> 02:12:07,443
Champa!

2156
02:12:07,443 --> 02:12:09,265
Champa!

2157
02:12:09,265 --> 02:12:23,306
Champa!

2158
02:12:23,306 --> 02:12:24,053
Champa!

2159
02:12:24,053 --> 02:12:25,523
You?

2160
02:12:25,523 --> 02:12:26,006
Why have you come here?

2161
02:12:26,006 --> 02:12:27,778
I want to meet your father!

2162
02:12:27,778 --> 02:12:29,323
My father is not at home.

2163
02:12:29,323 --> 02:12:30,299
You leave!

2164
02:12:30,299 --> 02:12:32,362
You will have to come with me right now.

2165
02:12:32,362 --> 02:12:34,043
No!

2166
02:12:34,043 --> 02:12:38,003
You cheated me and now you want to defame me?

2167
02:12:38,003 --> 02:12:40,923
Day after tomorrow I am getting married.

2168
02:12:40,923 --> 02:12:42,234
Marriage?

2169
02:12:42,234 --> 02:12:43,725
With?

2170
02:12:43,725 --> 02:12:45,258
With Mohan.

2171
02:12:45,258 --> 02:12:47,142
Do come for the wedding!

2172
02:12:47,142 --> 02:12:53,133
See me getting ruined with your own eyes!

2173
02:12:53,133 --> 02:12:56,017
I dint get a chance to clear your misconception.

2174
02:12:56,017 --> 02:12:58,556
And now no use clearing it also.

2175
02:12:58,556 --> 02:13:00,374
Come with me.

2176
02:13:00,374 --> 02:13:03,742
Your mother is waiting for you.

2177
02:13:03,742 --> 02:13:04,781
My mother?

2178
02:13:04,781 --> 02:13:06,027
Yes!

2179
02:13:06,027 --> 02:13:07,629
You have no idea who are you!

2180
02:13:07,629 --> 02:13:09,915
Life is playing games with you

2181
02:13:09,915 --> 02:13:11,635
It has separated you from your mother!

2182
02:13:11,635 --> 02:13:13,121
That's it.

2183
02:13:13,121 --> 02:13:14,859
I understood.

2184
02:13:14,859 --> 02:13:17,307
You want to cheat me!

2185
02:13:17,307 --> 02:13:21,045
My father wouldnt have told me if my mother was alive?

2186
02:13:21,045 --> 02:13:22,411
No!

2187
02:13:22,411 --> 02:13:25,017
Because your father had nabbed you from her.

2188
02:13:25,017 --> 02:13:26,615
The one you consider to be your father...

2189
02:13:26,615 --> 02:13:27,567
...he means nothing to you!

2190
02:13:27,567 --> 02:13:28,827
Shut up!

2191
02:13:28,827 --> 02:13:31,636
Leave from here.

2192
02:13:31,636 --> 02:13:33,375
Champa!

2193
02:13:33,375 --> 02:13:35,091
See what I got for you.

2194
02:13:35,091 --> 02:13:37,017
A silk dress, some ornaments!
Father!

2195
02:13:37,017 --> 02:13:39,346
I am not your daughter?

2196
02:13:39,346 --> 02:13:40,871
Who told you?

2197
02:13:40,871 --> 02:13:42,008
Raju said.

2198
02:13:42,008 --> 02:13:43,717
He says my mother is alive!

2199
02:13:43,717 --> 02:13:45,952
He is a liar and is even cunning!

2200
02:13:45,952 --> 02:13:47,573
You are my daughter!

2201
02:13:47,573 --> 02:13:49,029
Why did he say so?

2202
02:13:49,029 --> 02:13:54,207
And how dare you call Champa your daughter?

2203
02:13:54,207 --> 02:13:56,767
Who?
Raju!

2204
02:13:56,767 --> 02:13:58,416
Rascal, Scoundrel!

2205
02:13:58,416 --> 02:14:00,048
You cheated my daughter.

2206
02:14:00,048 --> 02:14:01,909
You played with her feelings!

2207
02:14:01,909 --> 02:14:03,376
How dare do you come here?

2208
02:14:03,376 --> 02:14:05,923
Leave from here!

2209
02:14:05,923 --> 02:14:07,674
I will go!

2210
02:14:07,674 --> 02:14:09,481
But I will even take Champa along with me.

2211
02:14:09,481 --> 02:14:10,009
No, No!

2212
02:14:10,009 --> 02:14:11,094
No one can separate us!

2213
02:14:11,094 --> 02:14:13,671
Nobody!

2214
02:14:13,671 --> 02:14:16,855
Today you are afraid of loosing a stranger?

2215
02:14:16,855 --> 02:14:19,495
Imagine what would have happened to her mother!

2216
02:14:19,495 --> 02:14:22,333
The day you nabbed her from her mother!

2217
02:14:22,333 --> 02:14:23,782
Shut up.

2218
02:14:23,782 --> 02:14:25,971
One more word...

2219
02:14:25,971 --> 02:14:27,059
....and I will kill you.

2220
02:14:27,059 --> 02:14:30,748
I will kill you!
Father!

2221
02:14:30,748 --> 02:14:33,194
You had killed me the same day..

2222
02:14:33,194 --> 02:14:40,356
....when you had sold me for alcohol!

2223
02:14:40,356 --> 02:14:42,325
Child!

2224
02:14:42,325 --> 02:14:45,401
You are Raju?

2225
02:14:45,401 --> 02:14:46,472
Child!

2226
02:14:46,472 --> 02:14:48,762
Yes!

2227
02:14:48,762 --> 02:14:52,155
Raju?

2228
02:14:52,155 --> 02:14:53,743
Your child.

2229
02:14:53,743 --> 02:14:55,937
Your unlucky child!

2230
02:14:55,937 --> 02:14:58,873
Inspite of having a father lived like an orphan
at someone's place!

2231
02:14:58,873 --> 02:15:01,183
Stop it!

2232
02:15:01,183 --> 02:15:05,467
I have got my punishment!

2233
02:15:05,467 --> 02:15:07,909
Please dont hurt me anymore!

2234
02:15:07,909 --> 02:15:09,698
I know.....

2235
02:15:09,698 --> 02:15:13,928
...I have no rights to call you my son.

2236
02:15:13,928 --> 02:15:16,657
I lost my rights....

2237
02:15:16,657 --> 02:15:21,547
.....the same day I sold you!

2238
02:15:21,547 --> 02:15:23,054
Father!

2239
02:15:23,054 --> 02:15:26,252
Is this true?

2240
02:15:26,252 --> 02:15:28,216
Why arent you saying?

2241
02:15:28,216 --> 02:15:29,888
Why dont you say?

2242
02:15:29,888 --> 02:15:35,246
Please say it’s all a lie!

2243
02:15:35,246 --> 02:15:39,318
All my life I have lived on this lie!

2244
02:15:39,318 --> 02:15:40,854
But today...

2245
02:15:40,854 --> 02:15:45,559
....truth has slapped me and given me an answer!

2246
02:15:45,559 --> 02:15:50,521
I cant lie anymore!

2247
02:15:50,521 --> 02:15:57,394
Let me talk now!

2248
02:15:57,394 --> 02:15:59,078
Child!

2249
02:15:59,078 --> 02:16:02,702
You are Sir Sanjeevlal's daughter!

2250
02:16:02,702 --> 02:16:05,324
I had stolen you from him!

2251
02:16:05,324 --> 02:16:34,454
Had stolen you to kill you!

2252
02:16:34,454 --> 02:16:39,467
Dinu, Dinu!

2253
02:16:39,467 --> 02:16:42,136
I was blinded!

2254
02:16:42,136 --> 02:16:45,439
And saved me from a sin!

2255
02:16:45,439 --> 02:16:49,092
After I turned blind and became helpless.....

2256
02:16:49,092 --> 02:16:52,207
.....I had no one in my life!

2257
02:16:52,207 --> 02:16:54,456
So I adopted you!

2258
02:16:54,456 --> 02:16:58,045
You were my only support!

2259
02:16:58,045 --> 02:17:01,776
I dont want to hear anything!

2260
02:17:01,776 --> 02:17:05,432
You are my father however you may be!

2261
02:17:05,432 --> 02:17:07,051
I dont know anyone!

2262
02:17:07,051 --> 02:17:09,213
Ranima has come with me!

2263
02:17:09,213 --> 02:17:10,523

2264
02:17:10,523 --> 02:17:12,466
Yes!

2265
02:17:12,466 --> 02:17:13,859
She is sitting outside in the car.

2266
02:17:13,859 --> 02:17:15,504
I have bought her along.

2267
02:17:15,504 --> 02:17:16,009
No, No!

2268
02:17:16,009 --> 02:17:19,132
No, No

2269
02:17:19,132 --> 02:17:23,872
I cant face her.

2270
02:17:23,872 --> 02:17:27,853
Wont you ask for an apology?

2271
02:17:27,853 --> 02:17:30,432
I wont be able to face the world.

2272
02:17:30,432 --> 02:17:33,287
I will get her along!

2273
02:17:33,287 --> 02:17:34,799
Father!

2274
02:17:34,799 --> 02:17:37,749
I wont leave you and go!

2275
02:17:37,749 --> 02:17:39,587
Child!

2276
02:17:39,587 --> 02:17:42,049
Please forget me.....

2277
02:17:42,049 --> 02:17:46,369
....I am no one to you!

2278
02:17:46,369 --> 02:17:48,006
Child!

2279
02:17:48,006 --> 02:17:50,885
You will live like a princess!

2280
02:17:50,885 --> 02:17:53,085
You will live a luxurious life!

2281
02:17:53,085 --> 02:17:54,597
I dont want anything.

2282
02:17:54,597 --> 02:17:57,353
I want to live with you.

2283
02:17:57,353 --> 02:17:58,834

2284
02:17:58,834 --> 02:18:03,066

2286
02:18:04,324 --> 02:18:05,699
Who is she?

2287
02:18:05,699 --> 02:18:08,085
She is Champa Ranima!

2288
02:18:08,085 --> 02:18:13,623
Your daughter.

2289
02:18:13,623 --> 02:18:15,204

2340
02:23:03,038 --> 02:23:04,907
Rajeev, Sir!

2341
02:23:04,907 --> 02:23:07,033
Shaamlalji!
Mohan has taken Champa to the temple!

2342
02:23:07,033 --> 02:23:07,858

You will have to complete the rituals after
I read the mantra!

2347
02:23:20,367 --> 02:24:55,944
Shut up and be quick.

2348
02:24:55,944 --> 02:24:57,248
You are here!

2349
02:24:57,248 --> 02:24:58,026
You are fine?

2350
02:24:58,026 --> 02:25:00,288
I am fine but save Raju!

2351
02:25:00,288 --> 02:25:01,033
He is in danger!
Where is he?

2352
02:25:01,033 --> 02:25:03,037
Behind those pipes!

2353
02:25:03,037 --> 02:29:55,812
Be quick.

2354
02:29:55,812 --> 02:30:00,041
"Your veil is in my hands"

2355
02:30:00,041 --> 02:30:04,894
"Happiness comes with you"

2356
02:30:04,894 --> 02:30:09,467
"My heart dances on seeing this"

2357
02:30:09,467 --> 02:30:13,369
"Love stretches itself"

2358
02:30:13,369 --> 99:59:59,999
"I became crazy just like a cloud"
