2
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:08,749
What's so funny, dad?
The roads are really bad!

3
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:13,374
Tadkalal, are all
the arrangements done?

4
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:16,707
Can anything be amiss with me around?

5
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:21,249
Uncle, they're here!

6
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:23,749
But why are you so excited?

7
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:25,999
Go and see if Muskaan
is ready or not.

8
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,332
They're very respectable people,
so please behave courteously.

9
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:31,957
Don't you worry, dad.
I'll handle it!

10
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:33,999
Many of your proposals
were rejected..

11
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,582
..so you must be having
some experience! - What?

12
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:38,957
Don't be funny!

13
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:43,040
Hello, sir!
- Hello.

14
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:45,540
You've built a beautiful house!

15
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:49,707
Beautiful. - l worked a little.
The rest is god's mercy.

16
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:54,749
He's my son Balwinder.
- Billu.

17
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:58,290
He's a bit!
- Not a bit, but quite a lot.

18
00:03:58,291 --> 00:04:00,082
Come in.
- Let's go!

19
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:03,624
Yes. - Did you face
any problem on the way?

20
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:08,082
In a village where everyone knows
you, how can there be problems?

21
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:10,457
But the roads are really bad.

22
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,915
The roads are bad
but people are good.

23
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,707
That's why we've come here.

24
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:17,540
Will you have something?
- Why not?

25
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:18,957
Please. Good.

26
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:22,790
You know why we've come here.
- Yes, I do.

27
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:25,415
Ujala, bring Muskaan here.

28
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:32,540
Dad, you've got it!

29
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,915
Dad, let's go back!

30
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:58,957
A ghost!

31
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:00,540
Muskaan, sit properly!

32
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,707
Good sense of humour!
lt's happening!

33
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:11,874
She's beautiful!
- Yes!

34
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:15,915
My son likes your Muskaan.

35
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:17,957
What's your opinion?

36
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:21,040
Let me ask Muskaan.

37
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:25,165
Did you like the hero?

38
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:28,582
The question of my
choice doesn't arise.

39
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:30,957
Let them meet brother Vishal first.

40
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:39,249
Hey, if Vishal comes, then
the alliance will be fixed!

41
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:45,915
There's Vishal.

42
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:52,707
They've come with a
proposal for Muskaan. - Yes.

43
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,499
Hi!

44
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:56,999
God help him!

45
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,707
Cool! Relax!

46
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,665
My name is Balwinder!

47
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:06,332
People lovingly call me Billu!

48
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:09,665
Billu, don't shake so much!
He's wiggling!

49
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:12,040
What's it?
- Don't spoil things!

50
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:14,957
What's the matter?
- I can come here only if she goes!

51
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:19,707
Uncle, may I show my
future brother-in-Iaw my estate?

52
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:21,165
Yes!
- No. Vishal!

53
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:22,749
Yes.
- No!

54
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,874
Yes. - I would like to
see my in-laws place.

55
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:28,707
No.
- Let them go.

56
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,665
They'lI Ieave as a pair
but only one will return.

57
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:39,082
Come on.
- Yes! Let's go!

58
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:40,749
"We're the world!"

59
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:43,332
He'll face the music!
- Music?

60
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:47,082
Don't worry about that.
There'lI be music in the wedding.

61
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:49,499
l fear that
he may face it right now!

62
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:50,999
Slow.

63
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,207
Slow!

64
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:56,624
There's nothing to worry.
Everything will be fine.

65
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,165
That's not funny!

66
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:05,790
By now, Billu and Vishal
must've become fast friends.

67
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:09,499
Don't go fast!
- There's grass ahead!

68
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:11,707
No!

69
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:20,874
My Billu is such an
expert in conversation..

70
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:22,999
..that Vishal wilI become his fan!

71
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:33,540
Why didn't they both return yet?

72
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:35,957
Dad! Help me!

73
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,624
I think they'll fix the
marriage there itself.

74
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,249
Horse, why did you drop me down?

75
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:49,374
There they are!

76
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:53,457
But I can't see my BiIlu anywhere!

77
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:57,332
I had toId you that they'lI leave
as a pair but only one wiIl return!

78
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:06,749
Mummy!

79
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:11,124
My dear, BilIu!

80
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:15,374
What a ride!

81
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:18,540
Dad, this brother-in-law
is very bad!

82
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:19,999
What?
- No!

83
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,124
Come on!

84
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,124
He showed me around
the estate thoroughly!

85
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:30,624
From top to bottom, from
the trees, from every angle!

86
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:33,665
Let's go back!

87
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:35,540
Hey! He's badly hurt!
- God!

88
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:39,999
If you didn't approve of my son,
you could've just refused!

89
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,749
He's nice. - Even l didn't
know that he'd be in this state.

90
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:43,832
Come.

91
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,624
Let's go, Balwinder!

92
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:48,999
Don't be funny! Billu.
- Yes.

93
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,707
The boy was a sample!

94
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,582
I knew that I couldn't approve
of him and neither would you.

95
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:57,790
But why were you so offensive?

96
00:08:57,791 --> 00:08:59,624
He could've broken his Iimbs.

97
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:02,249
Sorry, uncle.
- Get going!

98
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:05,957
You threw him out!

99
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:16,957
Good!

100
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,457
What's this?

101
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:29,040
Okay, darling! Enjoy!

102
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:38,457
I liked this for brother.
How do you find it?

103
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:42,040
It's fine.
Anyway, you've to tie it.

104
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:43,665
Don't be so haughty!

105
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,374
Who knows, you might've
to tie it to him someday.

106
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:48,207
Shut up! Don't say so.

107
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,915
Your love is incredible, indeed.

108
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:55,624
Brother doesn't give you a damn,
but you always dream of him!

109
00:09:57,833 --> 00:10:03,957
I too dream. But the difference
is that I dream with open eyes.

110
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,999
And l see only you in my dreams.

111
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:10,957
I see.
- Yes.

112
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:15,249
Tell me, for how Iong wiIl your
brother keep on rejecting alliances?

113
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:19,624
Will he get you married or not?

114
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:24,332
What to do? A suitable
boy isn't to be found.

115
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,249
I'm there!

116
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:33,582
Tell your brother that
you've chosen the boy!

117
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:37,415
Tell him to come to my
place with a proposal.

118
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:39,499
Then things could fall in pIace!

119
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:44,999
Why don't you tell him yourseIf?
- l wouId've told him!

120
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,915
But the moment your
brother appears before me..

121
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:52,124
..he becomes worried and tense.
He begins to shake like a Ieaf!

122
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:55,415
ls it?
- Yes!

123
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:57,374
Are you done?
- Yes!

124
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:02,124
Go home, dear?

125
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,749
Shall I go home too?
- Wait.

126
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:09,832
Ok.

127
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,915
If you behave like
this again the next time..

128
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:19,124
..then your head will be
inside and your legs outside.

129
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:27,082
He fixed me properly!

130
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:34,415
Brother.

131
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:39,415
Brother.
- I'm here, dear.

132
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,874
You're sitting here and I've
been looking for you all over.

133
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:54,082
Forget what's happened.
Why bother about them.

134
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:57,499
But I have to bother about you,
dear.

135
00:11:58,041 --> 00:12:01,874
I can't toIerate
anybody misbehaving with you.

136
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:05,832
Forget it and have your meals.
C'mon.

137
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,082
You've cooked food?
- Yes.

138
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:18,832
It's deIicious.

139
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:32,290
Brother.

140
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:37,207
Wake up!

141
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:40,749
Wake up! Please!
- Let me sleep.

142
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,999
Please wake up!
- Why?

143
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,832
Because it's my day today and only
my orders wilI be obeyed! Get up.

144
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,874
Oh yes! It's the
festival today, isn't it?

145
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:54,124
Had you forgotten?
- How can I forget?

146
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:56,165
I live for this day.

147
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:01,249
Give me your hand.

148
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,874
May god bestow you with all joys.

149
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:20,915
Blessings alone
won't suffice this year.

150
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:25,582
I'm going to ask you for something
special this year. - What?

151
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:30,915
I want to go to Mumbai.
- Why?

152
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,540
Because I want to
move with the times.

153
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:37,040
I want to go to the
city for higher studies.

154
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:56,290
'VishaI dear, treat
Muskaan like a baby.'

155
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:58,624
'FuIfill every wish of hers.'

156
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:02,999
'Son, don't ever make her
feel the Iack of parents.'

157
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:05,540
'As she has nobody
else other than you.'

158
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:10,540
Okay.

159
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:15,707
Brother, thank you! You're great!

160
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:50,499
"I love you all!"

161
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:56,249
"Friends, I've no
destination or a life partner!"

162
00:14:58,125 --> 00:14:59,957
"Yet, I've set out from home."

163
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:02,332
"Maybe, the one I'm looking for.."

164
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:04,915
"..is my Iife partner,
my destination."

165
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:06,624
"Hit it!"

166
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:11,124
"O beloved, the
crazy one looks for you."

167
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:15,915
"You come in my dreams everyday,
come into my life, beloved."

168
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:20,207
"O beloved, the
crazy one looks for you."

169
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:26,374
"You come in my dreams everyday,
come into my life, beloved."

170
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:11,790
"My dream, the queen of
my thoughts."

171
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,707
"Our story will be made someday."

172
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,332
"My dream, the queen of
my thoughts."

173
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:29,749
"Our story will be made someday."

174
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:34,040
"It's in my lost senses
that l've taken this oath."

175
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:39,249
"One day, my love, l've
to attain you in love."

176
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:48,415
"You come in my dreams everyday,
come into my life, beloved."

177
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:52,624
"O beloved, the
crazy one looks for you."

178
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:57,957
"You come in my dreams everyday,
come into my life, beloved."

179
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:28,540
"She'Il be like a beautiful fairy."

180
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:33,540
"I don't know how
my beloved wilI be."

181
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:42,040
"She'lI be like
a beautifuI fairy."

182
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:46,540
"I don't know how
my beloved wilI be."

183
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:50,957
"I think of you. I love you."

184
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:55,999
"My heart wants to wipe
away aIl the distances."

185
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:09,374
"O beloved, the
crazy one looks for you."

186
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:13,999
"You come in my dreams everyday,
come into my life, beloved."

187
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:18,457
"O beloved, the
crazy one looks for you."

188
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:24,665
"You come in my dreams everyday,
come into my life, beloved."

189
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,332
"Come into my life, beIoved."

190
00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:01,082
Brother! Brother!

191
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:03,374
Cool it! Come on!
- What's your problem?

192
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:04,999
I'm so sorry.

193
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:14,207
Can't you see?

194
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:17,707
l can see, darling! That's why
I banged into a hunk like you!

195
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:20,749
Shall we go?

196
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,082
Hi, baby!

197
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:28,582
Please don't!
- Sorry!

198
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:31,999
Come.

199
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:36,874
You want to study in this jungle?

200
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:40,415
This isn't a jungle. It's the
biggest colIege of the city.

201
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:44,332
l can see. That's why there
are more beasts than people here.

202
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,790
That's the principal's office.

203
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:51,040
Smile, please. Come on.

204
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:54,832
Come in.

205
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:56,540
Come.

206
00:19:58,583 --> 00:19:59,915
Ok.

207
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:03,665
Good morning, sir.

208
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:06,290
Good morning!

209
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:07,624
Muskaan Thakur.

210
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:09,999
Oh yes! Sir's niece!

211
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,624
I was expecting you, dear.
Here's your form, fill it.

212
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:15,165
Thank you.

213
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:18,374
Who's he?
- He's my elder brother.

214
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:20,207
Oh eIder brother!

215
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:24,415
Why are you standing there,
shouldering a burden?

216
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:26,540
Lighten your burden and sit.

217
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:30,582
ln my coIlege, we lay stress on the
brains, not the shouIders. - Brains?

218
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,165
Students sell their
brains and come here!

219
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:37,374
And you speak of laying
stress on one's brains!

220
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,082
Have this city's mills shut down..

221
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:43,790
..that girls have
stopped wearing clothes?

222
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:47,999
Can't you see?
- l can!

223
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,415
Please sit.

224
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,832
Girls adorn themseIves with
jewellery, but here, the boys do!

225
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,540
Can't you see?
- I can.

226
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:02,957
They smoke as if this isn't a
college, but a cigarette factory!

227
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:07,124
Can't you see even that?
- Hey! I can see.

228
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:09,832
Then why don't you do something?

229
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:17,124
What can l do? This is the
culture these days, elder brother.

230
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:22,124
Culture? It was okay tiIl today,
but it'll not do from tomorrow.

231
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:26,415
Muskaan wilI come here to study.
- Yes.

232
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:29,999
Ok.

233
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:35,082
Father's name, Vishal Thakur.
Mother's name is Vishal Thakur too?

234
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:38,665
Vishal is my eIder brother's name.

235
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:41,999
I lost my parents in chiIdhood.

236
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:45,249
He's the one who has raised me.

237
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:50,499
He has forsaken his
happiness for mine.

238
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:54,499
Therefore my elder
brother means everything to me.

239
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,457
Ok.

240
00:21:57,041 --> 00:21:58,624
Understand?
- Yes.

241
00:21:58,625 --> 00:22:00,290
Let's go.
- One moment.

242
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:05,624
I'd Iike to tell you
something before you leave.

243
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:11,790
Looking at your love,
I remembered my sister today.

244
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:15,540
Like you, even I
used to Iove her a lot!

245
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:20,165
Like you, I used to
threaten people!

246
00:22:21,583 --> 00:22:24,457
I mean, I used to
explain to people!

247
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:28,957
But she fell in Iove
with somebody else!

248
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:35,249
She eIoped and
got married to him!

249
00:22:35,875 --> 00:22:37,249
Are you done?

250
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:41,499
Thank you, sir! Come on!

251
00:22:43,708 --> 00:22:45,290
Did I say something wrong?

252
00:22:46,875 --> 00:22:48,999
You shouldn't have
spoken to him that way.

253
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:52,957
You know, he's the
principal of this college!

254
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:57,582
Does he mean more to
you than your brother?

255
00:22:59,583 --> 00:23:00,874
No.

256
00:23:01,875 --> 00:23:04,040
Nobody means more to
me than my brother.

257
00:23:06,375 --> 00:23:10,124
If you ever need anything..

258
00:23:10,666 --> 00:23:13,957
..then there's no need to
write to me or calI me up.

259
00:23:14,541 --> 00:23:17,207
Just think about me
and l'll be here.

260
00:23:18,666 --> 00:23:20,415
Okay?
- Okay.

261
00:23:27,833 --> 00:23:30,707
Don't! - l won't spare you!
Where the hell are you running?

262
00:23:30,708 --> 00:23:32,374
Help!
- I won't spare you!

263
00:23:32,375 --> 00:23:33,999
Wait!

264
00:23:35,458 --> 00:23:38,332
Suraj, pIease save me!

265
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:42,165
Why are you thrashing the poor boy?
- He hit me with an egg!

266
00:23:42,166 --> 00:23:45,040
Ouch! Come in front!

267
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:47,332
You should be in the
front or in the side!

268
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:48,790
Why did you hit him with an egg?

269
00:23:48,791 --> 00:23:51,749
l wasn't hitting him,
I was only ragging him!

270
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:56,374
Indeed! One rags others
and not your own people!

271
00:23:56,375 --> 00:23:59,124
And this is our final
year in coIlege, understand?

272
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:01,957
That's provided we pass!
- Yes.

273
00:24:13,875 --> 00:24:15,249
What's the matter?

274
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:22,374
Nothing. But something's
definitely the matter.

275
00:24:26,541 --> 00:24:32,957
Look at me.

276
00:24:35,166 --> 00:24:36,249
Hi!

277
00:24:41,666 --> 00:24:42,874
Fool!

278
00:24:44,666 --> 00:24:49,082
She didn't even
acknowledge you! Such humiliation!

279
00:24:49,333 --> 00:24:54,540
Really? lf I don't have her chasing
me in 2 minutes, I'll be damned!

280
00:24:54,541 --> 00:24:56,707
Get Iost! Want to lay a bet?

281
00:24:56,708 --> 00:24:57,874
Do it!
- How much?

282
00:24:57,875 --> 00:24:58,999
500.
- 50,000.

283
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,165
1,000.
- Done.

284
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:01,582
Done. All the worst!

285
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:05,790
To you too!
- Get lost!

286
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:08,165
O god!
- Get lost!

287
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:18,624
'Want to Iay a bet?'

288
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:26,207
Hi!

289
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,165
Hello!

290
00:26:31,833 --> 00:26:35,999
OnIy 5 seconds left for 2 minutes
and there's no sign of Suraj!

291
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:44,999
FooI! Stop looking at
your watch and look ahead!

292
00:26:49,208 --> 00:26:51,332
Suraj's amazing!

293
00:26:55,291 --> 00:26:56,540
The money's lost!

294
00:26:58,416 --> 00:27:01,374
Why are you standing here?
- Manoj!

295
00:27:01,375 --> 00:27:02,457
Hi!

296
00:27:08,083 --> 00:27:09,832
What're you doing?

297
00:27:20,375 --> 00:27:22,915
Give me money!
- I'm just coming!

298
00:27:22,916 --> 00:27:25,374
Money!
- Will I have to?

299
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,457
Get down!
- Yes! Let's go!

300
00:27:33,458 --> 00:27:34,624
Bye!

301
00:27:37,958 --> 00:27:40,207
Hey wrestler!
- Get lost!

302
00:27:41,166 --> 00:27:42,249
Excuse me!

303
00:27:46,625 --> 00:27:48,207
Why did you call me to the library?

304
00:27:50,666 --> 00:27:56,165
What's it?

305
00:27:57,583 --> 00:28:02,165
lrrespective of what she thinks
of me, I think very highly of her.

306
00:28:02,666 --> 00:28:05,207
Of whom?
- Of her.

307
00:28:05,541 --> 00:28:07,499
Of whom?

308
00:28:08,458 --> 00:28:11,290
The girl with the bag.
- Which girl?

309
00:28:11,625 --> 00:28:13,415
The one whom I was running ahead of.

310
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:18,040
l see! But we thought that
she was running behind you!

311
00:28:18,291 --> 00:28:20,457
It's one and the same!

312
00:28:22,916 --> 00:28:24,540
Explain to me later!

313
00:28:26,625 --> 00:28:28,957
I just can't understand anything!

314
00:28:28,958 --> 00:28:30,874
I'll do that if you Iook at me!

315
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:34,374
There was a bag exactly like this.

316
00:28:34,375 --> 00:28:36,207
I picked the bag and..

317
00:28:39,625 --> 00:28:40,749
Hello!

318
00:28:41,458 --> 00:28:42,540
Hi.

319
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:51,207
WeIl, I was expIaining
to her that this bag..

320
00:28:51,833 --> 00:28:53,957
I've understood you very well.

321
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:55,790
Pardon?

322
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:58,207
Can I have my bag please?

323
00:28:59,375 --> 00:29:02,540
Thank you.

324
00:29:06,625 --> 00:29:09,290
Never mind!
- Thank you.

325
00:29:14,333 --> 00:29:15,749
She's here!

326
00:29:21,708 --> 00:29:23,790
Hi.
- Hi.

327
00:29:25,375 --> 00:29:28,624
My name's Ritu.
- l'm Muskaan.

328
00:29:29,833 --> 00:29:31,249
Are you new in college?

329
00:29:32,041 --> 00:29:34,790
How do you find our college?
- It's okay.

330
00:29:35,583 --> 00:29:39,957
And the peopIe here?
- Quite interesting.

331
00:29:41,083 --> 00:29:46,040
Friends!

332
00:29:50,041 --> 00:29:52,957
Hello, sir. How're you today?

333
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:54,707
Okay?

334
00:30:03,541 --> 00:30:05,540
Didn't you get money?
- I did.

335
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:08,165
Then why are you playing like this?
- What to do?

336
00:30:08,625 --> 00:30:10,707
It's my habit as I'm a good player.

337
00:30:11,208 --> 00:30:13,624
I've never played for money.
Made a mistake.

338
00:30:13,625 --> 00:30:14,915
Today, you are, right?
- Yes.

339
00:30:14,916 --> 00:30:17,040
Play welI and get out soon.
- Yes. - Okay?

340
00:30:18,458 --> 00:30:21,999
Our team is Iosing. And Suraj
is chatting with him merrily?

341
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,790
Team spirit!
- Yes!

342
00:30:24,791 --> 00:30:26,415
You won't understand!

343
00:30:30,791 --> 00:30:32,374
How's that!

344
00:30:42,291 --> 00:30:44,915
Why are they waving
each other goodbye?

345
00:30:45,208 --> 00:30:47,790
That's what I was
telling you! Team spirit!

346
00:30:47,791 --> 00:30:49,249
Team spirit!
- Yes!

347
00:30:50,333 --> 00:30:51,790
Yes!
- Yes!

348
00:30:57,125 --> 00:30:58,540
How's that!
- Yes!

349
00:30:58,541 --> 00:31:00,665
Not out! I was indicating this!

350
00:31:01,083 --> 00:31:02,874
Alright. He's out!

351
00:31:13,916 --> 00:31:16,165
Stop shaking!
I'm getting disturbed!

352
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:18,165
I'm not shaking!

353
00:31:18,166 --> 00:31:23,457
It's the breeze which is
swinging and shaking my body!

354
00:31:23,458 --> 00:31:26,624
Is it? Umpire!
- Stop shaking!

355
00:31:27,666 --> 00:31:30,790
If a player stops shaking,
then how'Il he field?

356
00:31:30,791 --> 00:31:34,749
PrincipaI, you know? His
shaking's intentional!

357
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:37,374
He's disturbing my player
deliberately! - Get lost!

358
00:31:37,375 --> 00:31:38,832
The match won't continue!

359
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:42,374
Why? The match will be played!

360
00:31:42,375 --> 00:31:45,915
No!
- It will!

361
00:31:47,666 --> 00:31:49,624
It will!

362
00:31:50,125 --> 00:31:53,332
No!
- It will. Why not?

363
00:31:53,875 --> 00:31:55,915
What're you doing?

364
00:31:55,916 --> 00:31:58,540
The principals have
been made umpires..

365
00:31:58,541 --> 00:32:01,832
..to avoid any problem in the match.
And both of you're fighting?

366
00:32:02,416 --> 00:32:06,415
Both of you should set an
example for aIl the students.

367
00:32:06,416 --> 00:32:10,499
On field, or off fieId, aIl
the players are sportsmen!

368
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:14,332
And the game should be played
in the true spirit! No cheating!

369
00:32:24,916 --> 00:32:26,665
Where were you lost?
- I'm right here.

370
00:32:26,666 --> 00:32:28,415
You stop shaking!

371
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:31,874
And you batsman! You stop watching!

372
00:32:31,875 --> 00:32:34,457
Come on, sir!
- Come on!

373
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,082
See?
- What?

374
00:32:37,083 --> 00:32:38,957
Our captain's handiwork!

375
00:32:44,625 --> 00:32:46,915
He's falIen!
- Throw the ball!

376
00:32:47,416 --> 00:32:49,707
Throw it fast!

377
00:32:49,708 --> 00:32:51,290
Come on, hurry up.
- Yeah! Howz that!

378
00:32:58,416 --> 00:33:01,374
Both of them..

379
00:33:03,791 --> 00:33:05,165
Isn't he looking towards us?

380
00:33:05,541 --> 00:33:08,707
Looks Iike a part of
our team's pIan.

381
00:33:10,875 --> 00:33:11,999
Plan!

382
00:33:13,208 --> 00:33:14,582
Give me the ball!

383
00:33:16,083 --> 00:33:17,707
Bowl!

384
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:21,165
Come on!

385
00:33:50,125 --> 00:33:52,832
I thought cricket is a
very sIow and boring game!

386
00:33:52,833 --> 00:33:55,582
But I'm enjoying it today.
- Aren't you?

387
00:33:55,583 --> 00:33:58,707
Thanks to our captain!

388
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:11,999
Hey! Didn't you get the money?
- l'm not for sale!

389
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:17,582
Last man, last wicket, last run.
I think we'Il lose now.

390
00:34:18,541 --> 00:34:22,707
Looks Iike we couldn't set
anything with this batsman.

391
00:34:22,916 --> 00:34:27,457
What?
- I mean, this batsman is well-set!

392
00:34:27,458 --> 00:34:30,957
I see! He's welI-set!

393
00:34:46,458 --> 00:34:48,582
Catch it!

394
00:34:51,291 --> 00:34:54,082
Good catch!
- Yeah!

395
00:34:56,583 --> 00:35:41,749
We've won!

396
00:35:43,458 --> 00:35:44,790
Congrats.

397
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,374
Congrats.
- Shake hands!

398
00:35:48,375 --> 00:35:50,415
Gloves!
- Pull it out.

399
00:35:50,416 --> 00:35:52,124
Pull out the gloves!

400
00:35:56,208 --> 00:35:58,207
At what price did
you buy up the team?

401
00:36:00,958 --> 00:36:03,624
What did she say?
- She said that we played well.

402
00:36:03,625 --> 00:36:07,540
My dear, I'm the principaI of
the coIlege where you study.

403
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:10,499
I'm sorry. I'm not free.

404
00:36:11,166 --> 00:36:13,707
Muskaan, I want to talk to you.

405
00:36:13,708 --> 00:36:15,957
l don't have the
time to listen to you.

406
00:36:18,041 --> 00:36:19,540
How sad!

407
00:36:23,666 --> 00:36:24,957
I'll show you now!

408
00:36:29,458 --> 00:36:30,749
What're you doing?

409
00:36:32,291 --> 00:36:33,415
Stop it!

410
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:40,457
Everybody's watching! Stop it!

411
00:36:45,541 --> 00:36:46,790
What's it?

412
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:54,749
l'm gIad you told me
everything about yourself.

413
00:36:54,958 --> 00:36:59,249
Like you, even l pIay
these stupid pranks at home.

414
00:36:59,458 --> 00:37:01,124
But I'm true at heart.

415
00:37:02,083 --> 00:37:05,665
This impIies you're not angry.
- I was never angry.

416
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:13,707
Good morning, sir.

417
00:37:22,041 --> 00:37:23,582
Give me.
- Here.

418
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,332
What's this?

419
00:37:29,125 --> 00:37:32,040
Compensation.
- Compensation?

420
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:39,457
On the 1st of every month my father..
- Thank you, sir.

421
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:41,915
Sends me lots of love.

422
00:37:44,791 --> 00:37:45,915
Muskaan.

423
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:50,582
I have some very
urgent work. Shall l leave?

424
00:37:52,166 --> 00:37:53,415
Okay.

425
00:38:07,333 --> 00:38:11,790
I told you, Iots of Iove.
This is it.

426
00:38:26,458 --> 00:38:27,790
Where could it disappear?

427
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,540
Search every cabinet and drawer!

428
00:38:33,166 --> 00:38:35,624
My necklace worth rupees
2.5 million can't get lost!

429
00:38:54,583 --> 00:38:58,374
Mother, you never ever
considered me a son.

430
00:38:58,875 --> 00:39:00,957
And today, you consider me a thief?
- Suraj.

431
00:39:01,666 --> 00:39:05,082
Dear, what's the need to get anxious
if your room is being searched?

432
00:39:05,083 --> 00:39:08,749
I'm not anxious, l'm feeling sad.

433
00:39:09,041 --> 00:39:12,499
AlI this beIongs to me, doesn't it?
- Yes, of course.

434
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:16,332
Wrong, darling. l own an
equal share of the inheritance.

435
00:39:17,666 --> 00:39:19,790
I'm your father's wife.

436
00:39:20,166 --> 00:39:23,332
And by that reIationship,
I'm your mother.

437
00:39:24,625 --> 00:39:28,290
Madam. There's no
necklace in this room.

438
00:39:28,875 --> 00:39:30,999
No probIem. Check there.
- Yes.

439
00:39:32,291 --> 00:39:33,457
Daddy.

440
00:39:34,333 --> 00:39:39,874
You've searched my room. Now ask
the servants to check her's too.

441
00:39:40,166 --> 00:39:43,499
See! Your son thinks l'm a thief!

442
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:46,582
No.
- My own necklace..

443
00:39:46,583 --> 00:39:50,207
No, this isn'tjust
about the necklace.

444
00:39:50,958 --> 00:39:53,790
But of victory and defeat.
- What's your implication, Suraj?

445
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:58,540
l wish to tell you for the first
time that she's not my mother.

446
00:39:58,833 --> 00:40:00,415
She's my stepmother.
- Suraj!

447
00:40:04,875 --> 00:40:08,540
This has been your weakness in life.

448
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:11,707
You've aIways left
your work incomplete.

449
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,332
For the sake of peace in this house,
it's better that I leave.

450
00:40:21,083 --> 00:40:22,415
But where'lI you go?

451
00:40:25,916 --> 00:40:27,499
You should've stopped me first.

452
00:40:28,875 --> 00:40:30,749
But instead you asked
me where I was going.

453
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:32,207
But.. listen..

454
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,624
Relax.

455
00:41:02,583 --> 00:41:05,124
Not fair!
Why didn't you run after me?

456
00:41:05,666 --> 00:41:08,707
Because this bag holds
no importance for me.

457
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,124
And what about me?

458
00:41:13,791 --> 00:41:14,874
Friends?

459
00:41:44,583 --> 00:41:45,915
Go, Suraj!

460
00:41:46,708 --> 00:41:49,915
Go! Go!

461
00:41:54,541 --> 00:41:57,915
Down there!

462
00:42:26,291 --> 00:42:28,957
Swine! Don't you even
know how to play a game?

463
00:42:31,708 --> 00:42:33,540
You always behave childishly!

464
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,999
Don't say that!

465
00:42:37,041 --> 00:42:38,540
Sour grapes! Come here!

466
00:42:38,541 --> 00:42:42,957
Come on, dwarf!
- Next! Suraj, why don't you play?

467
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:46,874
I don't play such foolish games!
- Listen to this!

468
00:42:47,083 --> 00:42:48,707
Let us play.
- Okay.

469
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:55,957
1. 2..

470
00:42:57,833 --> 00:42:58,915
3!

471
00:43:33,166 --> 00:43:37,207
It's a matter of honour!
- Come on, Muskaan!

472
00:43:40,041 --> 00:43:42,624
He got it!

473
00:43:43,958 --> 00:43:46,249
Look, Suraj lost!

474
00:43:46,583 --> 00:43:48,082
What did I do?

475
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,082
You..

476
00:43:50,291 --> 00:43:52,957
What? Tell me. What did I do?

477
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,040
Go on!

478
00:44:09,916 --> 00:44:11,124
Hi, Suraj!

479
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:30,332
Dwarf, your height's won't
increase by eating this!

480
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:32,915
Fatso, you'll break apart someday,
eating this way!

481
00:44:33,375 --> 00:44:37,290
You know, great film stars will
attend our college annual function!

482
00:44:37,291 --> 00:44:39,457
We know.
- How?

483
00:44:39,458 --> 00:44:41,124
We'll be bringing them.

484
00:44:42,083 --> 00:44:44,665
AIl of you?
- I mean Suraj.

485
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,290
Do you know these film stars?

486
00:44:48,291 --> 00:44:53,290
They're Suraj's chiIdhood friends!
- Yes, we indeed are!

487
00:44:54,583 --> 00:44:55,832
Really?

488
00:44:58,583 --> 00:45:00,499
I've only seen them on screen!

489
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:02,582
Now see them cIosely!

490
00:45:03,375 --> 00:45:06,582
Stay away! Fool!

491
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,415
Would you introduce
them to me? Please!

492
00:45:09,416 --> 00:45:13,624
Not once, but ten times!
- And one autograph, okay?

493
00:45:14,041 --> 00:45:17,457
An autograph? Take
their entire autobiography!

494
00:45:18,125 --> 00:45:19,207
Thank you!

495
00:45:32,291 --> 00:45:34,582
Brothers and female friends!

496
00:45:34,583 --> 00:45:36,290
Hey! Say sisters!

497
00:45:37,791 --> 00:45:38,874
Ok!

498
00:45:39,291 --> 00:45:44,040
My Iove to my dear
brothers and their sisters!

499
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,540
Today, on the day of our
college's annual function..

00:45:47,541 --> 00:45:53,999
..I present those personalities
who've made India proud!

Applaud!

502
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:08,374
Do I look good?
- It's a golden chance!

503
00:46:08,375 --> 00:46:09,540
Shall I go?

504
00:46:16,708 --> 00:46:19,707
HelIo!

505
00:46:21,916 --> 00:46:24,832

Greetings!

And a huge round of applause

00:46:42,458 --> 00:46:44,540
For him..
- Greetings.

509
00:46:46,333 --> 00:46:47,999
Applaud please!

510
00:46:48,458 --> 00:46:50,957
This is how an AnnuaI
Day function shouId be!

511
00:46:51,458 --> 00:46:54,957
Not like your coIlege! Cheap!
- What?

512
00:46:55,208 --> 00:46:58,707
I know that you've
seen them only on screen.

513
00:47:00,166 --> 00:47:03,790
They're very friendly. So you
may ask them anything you like.

514
00:47:05,333 --> 00:47:08,457
Me.. let me ask a question!
- Okay, sir.

515
00:47:11,791 --> 00:47:15,249
Sir, may I ask you a question?
- Yes.

516
00:47:17,458 --> 00:47:20,540
You've started applauding?
Let me ask the question first!

517
00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:25,207
I've been an ardent fan of yours!

518
00:47:26,041 --> 00:47:29,957
I've seen every film of yours.
First day, first show!

519
00:47:30,958 --> 00:47:35,124
The new generation has taken over.

520
00:47:35,125 --> 00:47:38,415
How do you feel about that?
- Quiet!

521
00:47:44,458 --> 00:47:47,249
These kiddos cannot replace us!

522
00:47:48,458 --> 00:47:50,290
Hey you!

523
00:47:51,625 --> 00:47:54,207
It's his chiIdhood name!

524
00:47:55,875 --> 00:47:59,040
Your eyesight is
getting weaker with age!

525
00:47:59,041 --> 00:48:00,832
A star like me appears
a kid to you!

526
00:48:02,875 --> 00:48:06,165
Remain silent for some time, okay?

527
00:48:06,666 --> 00:48:11,374
Hey you! You've lost your crowning
glory, but not your arrogance!

528
00:48:12,041 --> 00:48:16,082
Get a hold on your tongue or..

529
00:48:16,291 --> 00:48:18,499
Or what? Will you go to my father?

530
00:48:19,041 --> 00:48:21,790
Where else? He's as
old as your father!

531
00:48:21,791 --> 00:48:24,374
Down but not out!

532
00:48:25,708 --> 00:48:29,790
Your backs are broken, but not
your arrogance! - Shut up! Or..

533
00:48:31,375 --> 00:48:33,290
Why are they fighting, Suraj?

534
00:48:34,416 --> 00:48:37,374
They're not fighting,
they're acting.

535
00:48:37,583 --> 00:48:41,957
Hey, you uncouth man!
Apologize to me and him!

536
00:48:42,166 --> 00:48:46,999
Apologize or..
- Or what? You're threatening me?

537
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,582
Shut up!
- Hey you! Move ahead!

538
00:48:49,583 --> 00:48:52,790
Shut up!
- Stop threatening! Just touch me!

539
00:48:52,791 --> 00:48:54,040
Shut up!

540
00:48:54,041 --> 00:48:57,957
Skinny legs, if I blow,
you'Il fIy away! - Shut up!

541
00:49:00,916 --> 00:49:03,124
Moustache!
- Shaky!

542
00:49:04,291 --> 00:49:07,040
Hey, oIdie, have you gone crazy?

543
00:49:07,875 --> 00:49:09,374
I'll just come.

544
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:11,415
You called me crazy?

545
00:49:11,666 --> 00:49:14,957
What're you doing, sir?
- Hey you duplicate, move aside!

546
00:49:14,958 --> 00:49:17,874
What?
- Was he a duplicate?

547
00:49:17,875 --> 00:49:19,540
Obviously!

548
00:49:19,541 --> 00:49:22,749
Quiet!
- Skinny Iegs.. - Quiet!

549
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,124
Look at the person first! He's not
a duplicate but the organizer!

550
00:49:26,125 --> 00:49:27,957
We've to take money
from him. Please go.

551
00:49:28,416 --> 00:49:30,624
They're duplicates! Beat them!

552
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,499
What's up?

553
00:49:45,583 --> 00:49:48,624
Muskaan, I did alI this for you.
- I shook hands with them!

554
00:49:51,666 --> 00:49:52,874
Cheap?

555
00:49:54,458 --> 00:49:56,332
Suraj!

556
00:49:59,208 --> 00:50:01,874
Hey, don't worry!

557
00:50:01,875 --> 00:50:04,499
Fool! Don't worry indeed!

558
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:07,832
After yesterday's fiasco, the
principal wants to meet my parents.

559
00:50:07,833 --> 00:50:11,332
And you ask me not to worry!
- Why get tensed?

560
00:50:11,333 --> 00:50:13,999
Call your parents.
They'll come and meet the principal.

561
00:50:14,375 --> 00:50:17,457
My parents haven't
met me for two years.

562
00:50:17,458 --> 00:50:19,374
Will they come to meet
the principal?

563
00:50:19,375 --> 00:50:23,374
Suraj, what'll happen now? Tell us.

564
00:50:23,666 --> 00:50:25,999
I've finished thinking.
It's your turn now!

565
00:50:26,458 --> 00:50:27,624
Okay.

566
00:50:27,625 --> 00:50:31,249
If we had the brains to think,

567
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:33,999
then wouId we be in the
same class for 3 years?

568
00:50:35,666 --> 00:50:36,790
Fatso!

569
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,749
This means I'lI be suspended.

570
00:50:50,041 --> 00:50:52,207
How dare you do this?

571
00:50:52,625 --> 00:50:55,707
You've threatened my child?
- Munna!

572
00:50:55,958 --> 00:50:59,124
Don't you know who I am?
- Who're you?

573
00:50:59,333 --> 00:51:01,749
I'm Suraj Khanna's mother!

574
00:51:03,166 --> 00:51:06,332
If I wish, I can buy the
entire city in a night!

575
00:51:06,333 --> 00:51:08,874
And sell this college in a day!

576
00:51:09,458 --> 00:51:12,707
PIease don't do that,
madam! What'll I do then?

577
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:15,582
Who the hell is it?
- Here I am, sir!

578
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:17,040
Sorry sir!

579
00:51:18,208 --> 00:51:20,790
Suraj, come in!
- Sir, I..

580
00:51:22,083 --> 00:51:24,999
Look who's here to meet you.
- Who?

581
00:51:25,333 --> 00:51:27,499
Your mother!
- What?

582
00:51:27,833 --> 00:51:29,082
Mother!

583
00:51:37,375 --> 00:51:39,499
Damn! You?

584
00:51:40,333 --> 00:51:43,165
I mean, mother, you?

585
00:51:43,416 --> 00:51:46,874
Dear!
- Mother!

586
00:51:47,416 --> 00:51:49,124
Come and sit.

587
00:51:49,291 --> 00:51:53,124
The principal has harassed you a lot,
hasn't he? - Yes, mother.

588
00:51:53,125 --> 00:51:54,957
No, mother.
- No, mother.

589
00:51:54,958 --> 00:52:00,415
Looking at your state, I'm thinking
of building a new colIege for you!

590
00:52:00,416 --> 00:52:02,165
Yes, mother.
- No!

591
00:52:02,166 --> 00:52:06,499
Here's the cheque book! I'm ready
to pay any price for my son's folly!

592
00:52:06,750 --> 00:52:07,874
Right, son?

593
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:10,915
WeIl done, child! l mean, mother!

594
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,999
Why are both of you laughing?

595
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,582
Why? Do you have a problem?

596
00:52:17,583 --> 00:52:19,082
No, I don't have a..
- Good.

597
00:52:19,083 --> 00:52:20,665
Because you can't afford to have one.

598
00:52:20,666 --> 00:52:22,249
I never had a..
- Liar!

599
00:52:23,875 --> 00:52:27,415
You've harassed my son a lot.
Now tell me what your decision is!

600
00:52:27,416 --> 00:52:29,332
It has been decided, madam.

601
00:52:30,125 --> 00:52:32,540
From now on, this
college belongs to your son.

602
00:52:32,541 --> 00:52:35,374
If I could, I'd gift
the whole city to Suraj.

603
00:52:35,875 --> 00:52:36,999
Right?

604
00:52:38,041 --> 00:52:40,040
C'mon
- C'mon, Munna!

605
00:52:41,166 --> 00:52:42,249
Wait a minute.

606
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,207
I'd Iike to tell you
something before you leave.

607
00:52:54,791 --> 00:52:55,874
Yes?

608
00:52:57,666 --> 00:52:59,457
Looking at your love,

609
00:53:02,875 --> 00:53:04,582
I remembered my mother!

610
00:53:05,916 --> 00:53:06,957
Mother?

611
00:53:10,083 --> 00:53:11,290
Take this.

612
00:53:12,208 --> 00:53:14,374
She used to also love me like this!

613
00:53:17,375 --> 00:53:20,415
She'd also pay for
every folly l committed!

614
00:53:22,166 --> 00:53:24,332
I mean, she'd discipline me.

615
00:53:25,416 --> 00:53:28,665
I can understand your grief!
- Don't give me anymore.

616
00:53:28,666 --> 00:53:30,207
You'll run out of them.

617
00:53:35,791 --> 00:53:37,915
Mother!
- Munna!

618
00:53:37,916 --> 00:53:40,124
You conned the principal!

619
00:53:43,875 --> 00:53:47,665
Mother!

620
00:53:50,958 --> 00:53:54,290
How she fooled the principal today!

621
00:53:54,291 --> 00:53:56,874
But what happened at the
principal's office, Suraj?

622
00:53:56,875 --> 00:53:58,665
Ask what didn't happen!

623
00:53:58,666 --> 00:54:00,374
Alright! What didn't happen?

624
00:54:00,375 --> 00:54:02,540
She turned out to be my mother!
- What?

625
00:54:02,541 --> 00:54:05,290
I mean, she's a greater
prankster than aIl of us together!

626
00:54:05,291 --> 00:54:09,332
Without her, the hero of your
college wouldn't be here today!

627
00:54:47,291 --> 00:54:51,665
Suraj, if the girl smiles,
it means she's floored!

628
00:54:51,666 --> 00:54:54,874
It's a golden opportunity
to tell her what you feel!

629
00:54:56,791 --> 00:54:57,957
Shall I?

630
00:55:30,375 --> 00:55:32,790
"Listen, beautiful!"

631
00:55:35,416 --> 00:55:37,832
"Tell me, dear one!"

632
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:55,374
"TeIl me that you
love me. Value my love."

633
00:55:55,375 --> 00:55:58,957
"Now don't be shy, beloved."

634
00:56:00,333 --> 00:56:05,499
"TeIl me that you
love me. Value my love."

635
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:09,207
"Now don't be shy, beloved."

636
00:56:10,458 --> 00:56:17,957
"Your thoughts torment me.
I can't sIeep at night, my dear."

637
00:56:18,291 --> 00:56:20,332
"Stop being stubborn."

638
00:56:20,875 --> 00:56:25,624
"Stop being stubborn,
crossing the limits, crazy lover."

639
00:56:25,875 --> 00:56:30,332
"l don't want to faIl in
love with you, O unknown lover."

640
00:56:30,333 --> 00:56:34,874
"You don't understand love.
Why don't you listen?"

641
00:56:35,208 --> 00:56:40,874
"I feel shy, I'm scared."

642
00:57:11,208 --> 00:57:16,124
"I've no controI
over my heart, beloved."

643
00:57:16,416 --> 00:57:20,790
"Don't torment me anymore,
come and hug me, beIoved."

644
00:57:20,791 --> 00:57:26,582
"I can't bear these distances,
I can't live without you."

645
00:57:26,583 --> 00:57:28,415
"Get lost, crazy one!"

646
00:57:29,041 --> 00:57:33,915
"Get lost, crazy one! Wake up!
Why are you after me?"

647
00:57:34,125 --> 00:57:38,499
"Why do you hold me like this,
grip my arms and pull me?"

648
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:43,124
"l won't come close
to you. I'Il go away."

649
00:57:43,458 --> 00:57:49,915
"I'll make your heart beat.
l'll torture you."

650
00:58:19,250 --> 00:58:24,332
"When l saw you for the first time,
l fell in love with you."

651
00:58:24,666 --> 00:58:28,999
"This lovely style
makes me go crazy."

652
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:34,749
"O beautifuI, agree to it quickly."

653
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:36,874
"You don't know anything."

654
00:58:37,291 --> 00:58:42,332
"You don't know and understand
anything. How do I explain to you?"

655
00:58:42,333 --> 00:58:46,707
"O beloved, how do
I teIl you my story?"

656
00:58:46,708 --> 00:58:51,624
"My heart fears,
you're in love with me."

657
00:58:51,625 --> 00:58:56,957
"Don't complicate it further,
don't be crazy."

658
00:59:02,208 --> 00:59:07,374
"TeIl me that you
love me. Value my love."

659
00:59:07,375 --> 00:59:10,957
"Now don't be shy, beloved."

660
00:59:12,375 --> 00:59:19,957
"Your thoughts torment me.
I can't sIeep at night, my dear."

661
00:59:20,166 --> 00:59:22,457
"Give up being stubborn."

662
00:59:22,750 --> 00:59:27,624
"Give up being stubborn,
crossing the limits, O crazy lover."

663
00:59:27,833 --> 00:59:32,249
"l don't want to faIl in
love with you, O unknown lover."

664
00:59:32,250 --> 00:59:36,957
"You don't understand love.
Why don't you listen?"

665
00:59:37,166 --> 00:59:43,124
"I feel shy, I'm scared."

666
00:59:52,375 --> 01:00:03,540
"My love, my refusal
means agreement."

667
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,707
I quit the army for
the sake of my chiIdren.

668
01:01:14,541 --> 01:01:16,540
I didn't know that..

669
01:01:16,916 --> 01:01:19,749
..I'd have to proclaim war
even after coming to the vilIage!

670
01:01:45,916 --> 01:01:47,165
Hit them!

671
01:02:30,125 --> 01:02:31,832
Vishal!
- UncIe.

672
01:02:31,833 --> 01:02:35,499
I hope you aren't hurt. Sorry!

673
01:02:37,125 --> 01:02:39,207
How could I hit you?

674
01:02:43,541 --> 01:02:46,249
Wait a minute. l've the cure!

675
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:53,874
Fool! Come on!
- Papa!

676
01:02:56,666 --> 01:02:58,290
Show me your hand!

677
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,749
It's heavier than uncIe's!

678
01:03:02,541 --> 01:03:06,082
Father, they've broken my bones!
- What's wrong, son?

679
01:03:07,083 --> 01:03:10,249
Why are you shouting? - Both of
them thrashed me very badIy!

680
01:03:10,583 --> 01:03:13,332
You can be sure
they've seized those fieIds!

681
01:03:13,625 --> 01:03:15,332
So you may as well forget it.

682
01:03:15,333 --> 01:03:17,040
Worn your shoes?
- Certainly.

683
01:03:17,041 --> 01:03:19,082
Then let's Ieave the village.
- Shut up!

684
01:03:20,791 --> 01:03:25,165
Look, Vishal and Thakur have
even resorted to fisticuffs now!

685
01:03:25,458 --> 01:03:27,332
Decency doesn't work anymore!

686
01:03:27,333 --> 01:03:30,624
Ever since they've come,
they've been bullying us!

687
01:03:31,791 --> 01:03:34,999
No. Even our Iand is
being usurped now.

688
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,749
This is too much!

689
01:03:38,208 --> 01:03:42,749
This calls for a viIlage committee
meeting! - Yes father, you're right!

690
01:03:45,125 --> 01:03:46,874
Where're we going, uncle?

691
01:03:47,458 --> 01:03:48,957
Village committee.
- Why?

692
01:03:49,791 --> 01:03:52,124
To have our pictures clicked!
- Nonsense, uncIe!

693
01:03:53,875 --> 01:03:57,790
Gajraj has created a
problem again to usurp the land.

694
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:02,165
If he acts smart today, then
I'll thrash him before the council!

695
01:04:02,166 --> 01:04:05,124
No! Don't be violent there.

696
01:04:05,333 --> 01:04:07,999
The committee has its
rules and regulations.

697
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:11,040
But if he acts tough,
then we'lI tackle the swine!

698
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,790
The fact is that

699
01:04:17,250 --> 01:04:21,207
I had bought the land
near the canal 15 years ago.

700
01:04:21,416 --> 01:04:26,499
I paid cash to Ajay Singh's
elder brother Pitamber Singh.

701
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,374
But we still don't
have any right to it!

702
01:04:29,750 --> 01:04:35,749
That land belonged to us, it
stilI does and will remain so!

703
01:04:36,041 --> 01:04:42,457
Respected men, the whole
village knows that I've never lied.

704
01:04:45,750 --> 01:04:49,790
Gajraj, I don't know much about you.

705
01:04:50,250 --> 01:04:52,707
But you do act quite well!

706
01:04:54,125 --> 01:04:57,832
Why are you needIessly
wasting my time and the council's?

707
01:04:58,041 --> 01:05:02,499
Time? You're the one who's
taking advantage of time.

708
01:05:03,083 --> 01:05:05,165
After your brother's death..

709
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:08,790
..you came here to take
possession of his inheritance.

710
01:05:11,333 --> 01:05:13,457
Spoken enough? Now listen to me!

711
01:05:13,750 --> 01:05:17,249
Do understand that my uncle
means more than my parents to me!

712
01:05:17,708 --> 01:05:20,749
He never got married so
that he could raise us!

713
01:05:21,125 --> 01:05:24,790
He sacrificed his happiness for
ours and you speak of inheritance?

714
01:05:25,125 --> 01:05:27,832
He has a right over
every inch of us, understand?

715
01:05:28,416 --> 01:05:29,582
Understand?

716
01:05:31,250 --> 01:05:34,915
Vishal, sit down.

717
01:05:37,250 --> 01:05:41,957
Ajay Singh promises
before the council,

718
01:05:43,125 --> 01:05:49,415
that if Gajraj brings the papers
of this land or provides any proof,

719
01:05:50,625 --> 01:05:52,874
then I'Il transfer this
land in his name today itself!

720
01:06:03,416 --> 01:06:05,082
After listening to everything..

721
01:06:05,083 --> 01:06:07,790
..the council gives its
verdict in favour of Thakur.

722
01:06:18,125 --> 01:06:23,957
Henceforth, if you try to
create a rift in my famiIy..

723
01:06:24,916 --> 01:06:29,207
..then the council wiIl
not give a verdict, I wilI!

724
01:06:36,166 --> 01:06:38,999
Father, get ready.
- Why?

725
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,165
We'll escape then!

726
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:46,832
No, it'll not happen.

727
01:06:47,583 --> 01:06:49,124
Wonder how it'll happen.

728
01:06:50,291 --> 01:06:52,040
When it'll happen..
- What is it?

729
01:06:52,333 --> 01:06:53,540
What is it?

730
01:06:53,833 --> 01:06:57,999
What is it?
- What is it?

731
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,874
Uncle, he was talking
to himself, not to you.

732
01:07:01,208 --> 01:07:02,665
What else can I do?

733
01:07:03,125 --> 01:07:05,540
OnIy Muskaan used to
talk in this house.

734
01:07:05,541 --> 01:07:07,249
She's gone to the city!

735
01:07:07,625 --> 01:07:10,249
Now l talk to myself
and get entertained!

736
01:07:10,750 --> 01:07:12,540
Spoken enough?
- Yes.

737
01:07:15,375 --> 01:07:19,124
What's the matter, Vishal?
Are you missing Muskaan?

738
01:07:20,958 --> 01:07:23,999
I'm going to DeIhi for
some work regarding the land.

739
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:26,457
Go and meet Muskaan.

740
01:07:46,333 --> 01:07:47,499
Come on.

741
01:07:47,666 --> 01:07:48,790
Vishal!

742
01:07:52,125 --> 01:07:54,415
Are you going to the city?
- Yes.

743
01:07:54,833 --> 01:07:56,874
To meet Muskaan?
- Yes.

744
01:08:04,208 --> 01:08:06,207
Give this to Muskaan on my behalf.

745
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,124
Okay.

746
01:08:16,750 --> 01:08:18,332
What'll I do?

747
01:08:19,041 --> 01:08:24,040
When it comes to this, I haven't
seen a bigger coward than you!

748
01:08:24,333 --> 01:08:25,665
That isn't the case!

749
01:08:26,166 --> 01:08:29,332
I'm giving a flower to someone for
the first time. What if she rejects?

750
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:34,457
Have you turned deaf?
Didn't you hear what she said?

751
01:08:34,666 --> 01:08:37,249
What?
- Her refusal means acceptance.

752
01:08:37,250 --> 01:08:38,624
Yes!

753
01:08:42,333 --> 01:08:44,874
Let's go then.
- Come on.

754
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,165
How dare you!

755
01:09:26,208 --> 01:09:28,290
Suraj, pIease try to understand.
He's my..

756
01:09:38,041 --> 01:09:39,790
We'll tackle him!

757
01:10:02,625 --> 01:10:03,707
What's it?

758
01:10:15,791 --> 01:10:17,290
Go on, my rhinoceros!

759
01:10:19,791 --> 01:10:20,999
Charge!

760
01:10:29,250 --> 01:10:32,707
Wow! What a body!

761
01:10:39,958 --> 01:10:41,374
Oh god!

762
01:10:43,875 --> 01:10:45,249
He's very strong!

763
01:10:45,250 --> 01:10:48,249
You're being beaten up in
front of the whole coIlege!

764
01:10:48,250 --> 01:10:50,082
You should've at least
thought of our honor.

765
01:10:50,708 --> 01:10:53,082
l'd think of honor
only if I remain aIive.

766
01:10:54,375 --> 01:10:57,290
That fellow hit me from behind.

767
01:10:57,791 --> 01:11:00,957
He hit all of us so much. Go
and hit him at least twice.

768
01:11:00,958 --> 01:11:04,457
Is it? I'lI beat him so hard
that he'll come to his senses!

769
01:11:04,458 --> 01:11:06,624
Go! Don't spare him!

770
01:11:32,250 --> 01:11:34,207
Muskaan! Can't you do something?

771
01:11:34,208 --> 01:11:36,415
Please! Oh God!

772
01:12:10,375 --> 01:12:11,832
I hit you twice!

773
01:12:12,333 --> 01:12:13,499
Come on!

774
01:12:14,166 --> 01:12:15,499
Oh God!

775
01:12:17,666 --> 01:12:18,832
Oh God.

776
01:12:37,416 --> 01:12:41,124
Who's this taIl and hefty man?
- That's what I wanted to telI you.

777
01:12:41,458 --> 01:12:43,915
He's my elder brother
- Brother?

778
01:13:02,083 --> 01:13:03,207
Let's go.

779
01:13:07,166 --> 01:13:08,332
Big brother.

780
01:13:11,833 --> 01:13:12,999
Listen to me.

781
01:13:13,250 --> 01:13:16,124
l listen to onIy those
who're elder to me or equal to me.

782
01:13:16,333 --> 01:13:19,665
That's why l'm teIling you that
Muskaan is my.. - Spoken enough?

783
01:13:21,458 --> 01:13:25,415
If you say a word,
then I'Il slice your tongue off!

784
01:13:25,416 --> 01:13:27,999
Excuse me, sir!
At least listen to me!

785
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:32,290
You listen to me! And if you have
a weak memory, then write it down!

786
01:13:32,291 --> 01:13:36,165
This was onIy a trailer.
Henceforth, if you try to meet her,

787
01:13:36,625 --> 01:13:38,582
it'll be your end!

788
01:13:50,666 --> 01:13:53,332
He hit me so hard that
everything's dislocated!

789
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,082
A brother-sister bond
is so strange, isn't it?

790
01:13:56,791 --> 01:13:58,999
When it was the
brother's turn to get beaten,

791
01:13:59,250 --> 01:14:00,957
Muskaan took him away.

792
01:14:01,250 --> 01:14:03,290
Or we'd have beaten him.

793
01:14:08,875 --> 01:14:09,999
Brother.

794
01:14:12,750 --> 01:14:15,957
Please Iisten to me.
- Is there anything Ieft to hear?

795
01:14:16,125 --> 01:14:18,624
They didn't know
that you're my brother.

796
01:14:19,458 --> 01:14:20,874
And l'm responsible for it.

797
01:14:21,625 --> 01:14:24,832
Had l toId them that
I've a brother like you..

798
01:14:25,333 --> 01:14:28,665
..then nobody wouId befriend me,
just like in the viIlage.

799
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:33,124
Spoken enough? You came here
to study, not to make friends.

800
01:14:33,375 --> 01:14:36,082
I made good friends
for the first time..

801
01:14:36,375 --> 01:14:38,749
..and you fought with them too.
- Wrong.

802
01:14:39,083 --> 01:14:42,165
He started the fight.
l onIy ended it.

803
01:14:42,416 --> 01:14:43,707
Poor Suraj..

804
01:14:44,833 --> 01:14:45,957
..has been fixed.

805
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:55,290
Come on, hurry up. Time for
the bus to leave. Come on.

806
01:15:07,833 --> 01:15:09,249
Give it to me, sir.

807
01:15:13,833 --> 01:15:17,999
Dear, you've to go this way.

808
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:19,290
Come on.

809
01:15:21,333 --> 01:15:25,999
Come on, hurry up! Start the bus.

810
01:15:28,666 --> 01:15:34,832
Brother-in-law, even
I've to go where you've to!

811
01:15:35,083 --> 01:15:37,374
Good night! See you at the village!

812
01:15:39,250 --> 01:15:50,165
Ujala!

813
01:16:00,625 --> 01:16:04,124
Alright! What're you doing here?

814
01:16:04,375 --> 01:16:08,957
Waiting. - And I was searching
for you at home.

815
01:16:09,416 --> 01:16:12,582
Father, get used to living alone.

816
01:16:13,541 --> 01:16:16,165
I'll be staying in this
house after some days.

817
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:24,457
You can't have your way until
a match is found for Muskaan.

818
01:16:25,125 --> 01:16:27,790
And l wonder how that boy wiIl be..

819
01:16:28,041 --> 01:16:30,790
..who'lI challenge Vishal.

820
01:16:40,583 --> 01:16:42,999
Come on, hurry up.

821
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,207
Come on, hurry up. Let's go!

822
01:16:58,583 --> 01:17:01,207
Oh no!

823
01:17:01,916 --> 01:17:05,207
You go to Thakur's
farmhouse daily, don't you?

824
01:17:05,208 --> 01:17:11,540
Where else will I go to build
these muscles, if not there?

825
01:17:13,208 --> 01:17:14,415
What's up, dude?

826
01:17:14,416 --> 01:17:17,582
He's milkman, I'm a carriage rider.
- Greetings.

827
01:17:17,833 --> 01:17:20,040
Is the carriage vacant?
- Do you see anybody?

828
01:17:20,041 --> 01:17:21,374
No, right?
- No.

829
01:17:21,375 --> 01:17:23,790
Then get in and telI me the address.

830
01:17:23,791 --> 01:17:29,124
Thakur's house.
- Hey! My carriage isn't vacant! Go!

831
01:17:29,125 --> 01:17:30,749
Why?
- Why?

832
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,540
Are you Thakur's kith or kin?
- No.

833
01:17:33,541 --> 01:17:35,207
A relative?
- I soon will be.

834
01:17:35,208 --> 01:17:38,915
Are you trying to woo Vishal
Thakur's sister by any chance..

835
01:17:38,916 --> 01:17:44,249
Hey! You may be fond of
breaking your limbs but I'm not!

836
01:17:44,250 --> 01:17:48,999
And if he learns that
I brought you to his farmhouse..

837
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,874
..then you'll Ieave the
village but I'lI leave this world!

838
01:17:51,875 --> 01:17:54,915
Try to understand.
- You aren't taking me there..

839
01:17:54,916 --> 01:17:56,332
..at least show me the way.

840
01:17:56,333 --> 01:17:58,915
l'lI tell you the
shortest route to get there.

841
01:17:58,916 --> 01:18:04,040
Behind the hills is a river which
fIows through Thakur's farmhouse.

842
01:18:04,250 --> 01:18:06,499
Now you can either swim
or drown to get there.

843
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:09,957
I'll read about you in the
newspaper tomorrow. 25 rupees.

844
01:18:10,250 --> 01:18:15,290
Why? - 10 rupees for guiding you,
15 for the bandages!

845
01:18:15,291 --> 01:18:18,332
It's so risky to
give you the address!

846
01:18:23,833 --> 01:18:25,124
I don't have change!

847
01:18:26,125 --> 01:18:27,457
Crazy!

848
01:18:49,875 --> 01:18:58,707
"I, crazy one, am going,
looking for her with love."

849
01:18:58,708 --> 01:19:01,999
"I, crazy one, am going.."

850
01:19:02,500 --> 01:19:10,415
"O breeze, tell me the
address to her house."

851
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:20,957
"I, crazy one, am going,
looking for her with love."

852
01:19:20,958 --> 01:19:25,040
"I, crazy one, am going."

853
01:19:52,000 --> 01:20:00,249
"Oh what a climate, what a sky,
the whole world is joyous."

854
01:20:00,541 --> 01:20:04,957
"The weather is beautiful."

855
01:20:09,750 --> 01:20:18,040
"Oh what a climate, what a sky,
the whole world is joyous."

856
01:20:18,291 --> 01:20:22,040
"The weather is beautiful."

857
01:20:22,333 --> 01:20:30,124
"This scene is beautiful,
so are these clouds."

858
01:20:31,958 --> 01:20:40,874
"I, crazy one, am going,
looking for her with love."

859
01:20:40,875 --> 01:20:45,165
"I, crazy one, am going."

860
01:21:07,291 --> 01:21:11,332
"She'Il feel shy, she'Il be scared."

861
01:21:11,833 --> 01:21:15,665
"Then she'll come close to me."

862
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:20,332
"I won't let her go."

863
01:21:25,083 --> 01:21:29,207
"She'Il feel shy, she'Il be scared."

864
01:21:29,583 --> 01:21:33,374
"Then she'll come close to me."

865
01:21:33,750 --> 01:21:37,499
"I won't let her go."

866
01:21:37,791 --> 01:21:45,749
"We'Il hug each other then."

867
01:21:47,333 --> 01:21:55,999
"I, crazy one, am going,
looking for her with love."

868
01:21:56,250 --> 01:22:09,415
"I, crazy one, am going."

869
01:22:11,541 --> 01:22:16,540
Nobody knows Vishal better than you.
Yet you befriended that boy?

870
01:22:17,666 --> 01:22:19,999
I don't know how all
this happened, Ujala.

871
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,207
Friendship or Iove?

872
01:22:29,500 --> 01:22:31,582
Muskaan, forget him.

873
01:22:31,833 --> 01:22:35,540
Like you said, after being
so badly beaten up by Vishal..

874
01:22:35,875 --> 01:22:37,499
..he must've also forgotten you.

875
01:22:39,250 --> 01:22:41,124
Tell me something.

876
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:45,957
Is Suraj 5 feet 10 inches taIl?

877
01:22:47,625 --> 01:22:49,290
Fair complexioned?

878
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,374
With big eyes?

879
01:22:53,208 --> 01:22:56,665
Yes, but how do you know all this?

880
01:22:58,875 --> 01:23:01,415
Because I can see him.
- What?

881
01:23:04,791 --> 01:23:05,915
Hi.

882
01:23:07,375 --> 01:23:08,624
No!

883
01:23:10,666 --> 01:23:13,665
I'm coming!

884
01:23:13,875 --> 01:23:17,499
What do we do now? - Get rid
of him, while I handle Vishal.

885
01:23:19,208 --> 01:23:21,040
Hi!
- What kind of insanity is this?

886
01:23:21,041 --> 01:23:23,874
What if brother Vishal sees you?
- But I've come to meet him.

887
01:23:24,541 --> 01:23:27,624
You don't know my brother. He..
- l'm here to know him.

888
01:23:28,791 --> 01:23:32,665
What's this? You've just come back
and have already started working?

889
01:23:32,666 --> 01:23:35,290
Move aside or I'lI
slice you also into two!

890
01:23:37,625 --> 01:23:39,457
Please try to understand me!

891
01:23:39,458 --> 01:23:42,040
It's not the time to understand,
but to explain.

892
01:23:49,083 --> 01:23:51,332
Please leave.

893
01:23:51,666 --> 01:23:53,915
l'm very scared. What if
anything happens to you?

894
01:23:59,875 --> 01:24:03,332
Muskaan, do you Iove me?

895
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:14,082
Yes.

896
01:24:14,791 --> 01:24:16,582
Then why fear when in love?

897
01:24:19,791 --> 01:24:22,374
Big brother!

898
01:24:35,708 --> 01:24:38,207
Vishal, Iet go of him!
- Move aside!

899
01:24:39,708 --> 01:24:44,040
One minute.. please
listen to what I have to say.

900
01:24:44,916 --> 01:24:47,707
I, myself, am surprised that I
have come tilI here for Muskaan.

901
01:24:48,875 --> 01:24:53,540
I know you love her a Iot and
can do anything to protect her.

902
01:24:54,166 --> 01:24:57,832
I don't even sat that I am
the best match for Muskaan.

903
01:24:59,458 --> 01:25:03,832
But I will keep her very
happy as I love her very dearIy

904
01:25:04,833 --> 01:25:06,499
Please give me a chance

905
01:25:07,041 --> 01:25:08,624
OnIy one chance.

906
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,040
Please give me a chance.
- Spoken enough?

907
01:25:26,125 --> 01:25:27,415
Come with me.

908
01:25:47,166 --> 01:25:48,249
Come on.

909
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:59,957
Hi Horsie! Hi Horsie!

910
01:26:13,500 --> 01:26:16,540
That's it! That's enough!

911
01:26:16,750 --> 01:26:20,540
I've been reiterating since so
long to him that I love Muskaan..

912
01:26:20,833 --> 01:26:24,082
..but he just refuses
to understand!

913
01:26:25,500 --> 01:26:27,957
Come on, return home!

914
01:26:29,583 --> 01:26:32,415
You have everything! So?

915
01:26:34,958 --> 01:26:38,457
I have everything..
except Muskaan.

916
01:26:41,666 --> 01:26:45,457
This route will take you to the city
where you have all the comforts.

917
01:26:46,291 --> 01:26:48,124
And this route will
take you to Muskaan.

918
01:26:48,750 --> 01:26:52,790
Where her bIoody brother
will make your life a hell.

919
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,999
On this side, is your
father's wealth in abundance.

920
01:26:56,875 --> 01:26:59,790
And on the other, is
Muskaan's true Iove.

921
01:27:00,625 --> 01:27:03,290
Over here, is the same,
old, rotten life.

922
01:27:03,708 --> 01:27:06,165
And over there, is destination

923
01:27:06,875 --> 01:27:10,165
So the right decision is
to go left or to go right.

924
01:27:10,458 --> 01:27:11,999
You! Fool!

925
01:27:13,833 --> 01:27:16,874
Are you blind! Do you drink
and drive? ShaIl I hit you!!

926
01:27:34,708 --> 01:27:37,582
Thank you, young man.
- You are welcome, sir.

927
01:27:47,958 --> 01:27:50,415
I have never seen you here before.

928
01:27:50,416 --> 01:27:52,082
I am new here.

929
01:27:52,083 --> 01:27:56,374
Well, every newcomer has
some or the other destination.

930
01:27:56,875 --> 01:27:59,415
Yes, I do. But the
path is very difficult.

931
01:28:00,208 --> 01:28:03,082
If there is a destination,
then the path cannot be difficult.

932
01:28:04,833 --> 01:28:07,457
I feel that l have
met with an accident..

933
01:28:07,750 --> 01:28:09,665
..but you are the one
affected by its outcome.

934
01:28:09,666 --> 01:28:11,082
That isn't the case, sir.

935
01:28:11,833 --> 01:28:13,499
Why do you look so suIlen?

936
01:28:13,500 --> 01:28:16,665
Sorrow is not befitting
on such an adorable face.

937
01:28:17,125 --> 01:28:19,957
You have Ient me your hand.
It's a great gesture.

938
01:28:20,625 --> 01:28:23,749
Can't l bring Muskaan
(smile) into your Iife?

939
01:28:24,833 --> 01:28:26,332
That is why I have come here, sir.

940
01:28:27,083 --> 01:28:28,957
Come on, man. Come on.

941
01:28:30,583 --> 01:28:35,290
One shouId not be disheartened.
This is what I've learnt from life.

942
01:28:35,708 --> 01:28:38,665
Everything is fair in love and war.

943
01:28:39,083 --> 01:28:41,707
Sir, after listening
to you, I have decided..

944
01:28:41,708 --> 01:28:45,374
not to Ieave this place
until my mission is successful.

945
01:28:45,375 --> 01:28:46,999
Oh, you are welcome.

946
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:48,665
Stay with me.

947
01:28:50,291 --> 01:28:53,707
But there is a condition, sir
I will help you with your work.

948
01:28:53,708 --> 01:28:55,457
Yes, why not?

949
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:59,499
This is my house.
- But why is it so dark here?

950
01:28:59,916 --> 01:29:01,957
We often face power cuts here.

951
01:29:02,916 --> 01:29:04,915
This is always a..

952
01:29:04,916 --> 01:29:07,999
Tadkalal!

953
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:09,540
I'm here, uncle.

954
01:29:09,541 --> 01:29:11,290
Vishal?
- Yes, uncle.

955
01:29:11,291 --> 01:29:12,790
You're back?
- Yes, uncle.

956
01:29:13,041 --> 01:29:15,957
How's Muskaan?
- Fine. She is aIso back.

957
01:29:15,958 --> 01:29:18,415
Really? She's back with you?
That's good. - Yes, uncle.

958
01:29:18,416 --> 01:29:19,832
Uncle, why have you
come so late at night?

959
01:29:20,500 --> 01:29:22,374
I met with a minor accident.

960
01:29:22,375 --> 01:29:24,332
You aren't hurt, are you?
- Absolutely not.

961
01:29:24,333 --> 01:29:26,915
This boy helped me out.
- Thank you.

962
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:32,374
He will stay with us for some days.
Make the necessary arrangements.

963
01:29:32,375 --> 01:29:33,665
Okay, uncle.

964
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,999
Oh Muskaan, how are you
my darling, how are you.

965
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:59,707
l'm fine UncIe.
- Oh so sweet.

966
01:30:01,791 --> 01:30:04,415
He is Suraj..
and she is my Muskaan.

967
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:08,707
Come inside.

968
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,957
Brother.. destiny has
brought him back here.

969
01:30:20,750 --> 01:30:22,207
There must be something about it.

970
01:30:43,541 --> 01:30:48,707
I can empathise with your anger
at having to hide this from uncle.

971
01:30:50,458 --> 01:30:54,999
But for my sake, can't you give even
a littIe time to understand Suraj?

972
01:30:58,125 --> 01:31:01,624
He's not a bad boy. In fact,
he's a good boy.

973
01:31:02,166 --> 01:31:05,749
I know that you love me very much.

974
01:31:06,916 --> 01:31:09,499
But even I love Suraj a Iot.

975
01:31:12,958 --> 01:31:15,374
I am a hen man!

976
01:31:22,458 --> 01:31:25,499
Is he the man of your choice? - Yes.

977
01:31:29,208 --> 01:31:30,332
Okay.

978
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:56,707
What will happen now? Brother
has taken Suraj to show the estate.

979
01:31:57,041 --> 01:32:00,874
Damn! Suppose Suraj also
runs away like BilIu, then?

980
01:32:03,166 --> 01:32:06,207
I wonder what plight brother
must have put Suraj in by now!

981
01:32:06,958 --> 01:32:10,582
Don't worry. Your city boy
will handIe things weIl.

982
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:19,207
Big brother, l really enjoyed!

983
01:32:19,208 --> 01:32:22,249
I have come Iying alI the way!
Thank you, big brother!

984
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,249
Goodman good, thank you.

985
01:32:30,250 --> 01:32:33,124
You will work with them today
- Okay.

986
01:32:34,791 --> 01:32:36,415
As welI as cook for the day.

987
01:32:36,416 --> 01:32:39,665
Okay. No problem.
Chinese, chow-chow.

988
01:32:40,875 --> 01:32:42,832
Okay, go now!

989
01:33:21,333 --> 01:33:23,999
Now the best meaIs will be ready.

990
01:34:33,250 --> 01:34:36,749
Vishal dear, call..
- Tadkalal

991
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,040
Tell him..
- Get food..

992
01:34:39,416 --> 01:34:40,957
Quickly.

993
01:34:40,958 --> 01:34:43,457
Hungry..
- I'm feeling very hungry.

994
01:34:43,458 --> 01:34:46,332
Tadkalal is not here today.
I've given him leave.

995
01:34:47,208 --> 01:34:50,374
Who'Il prepare the meals today?
- Suraj

996
01:34:51,250 --> 01:34:54,665
Suraj? Can he cook?

997
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,415
UjaIa..
- Yes, Uncle?

998
01:35:25,791 --> 01:35:28,749
It's my leg.

999
01:35:37,250 --> 01:35:39,124
Hi!
- Hello!

1000
01:35:39,125 --> 01:35:40,332
What's wrong with you?

1001
01:35:45,250 --> 01:35:50,207
Here I come! Eat and enjoy!

1002
01:35:50,208 --> 01:35:51,790
If you taste it,
you'Il never forget it!

1003
01:35:51,791 --> 01:35:55,874
Understand, guests and devils!

1004
01:35:55,875 --> 01:35:59,207
I'm sorry. I mean to say, brother!

1005
01:36:01,041 --> 01:36:03,790
This is for you! Diet food!

1006
01:36:03,791 --> 01:36:06,540
Carrots and fish!

1007
01:36:06,750 --> 01:36:10,874
Uncle, this is for you!
- Really?

1008
01:36:10,875 --> 01:36:14,165
This is for you, coloneI!

1009
01:36:17,416 --> 01:36:18,707
It's very..

1010
01:36:18,708 --> 01:36:20,415
Very tasty, isn't it?
- Yes!

1011
01:36:25,666 --> 01:36:27,915
You've cooked delicious food.

1012
01:36:35,916 --> 01:36:37,207
Good!

1013
01:36:38,333 --> 01:36:39,624
Thank you, sir.

1014
01:36:45,791 --> 01:36:49,124
Eat food!

1015
01:36:52,208 --> 01:36:55,332
Take it!

1016
01:37:12,041 --> 01:37:13,415
The food is tasty.

1017
01:37:41,166 --> 01:37:44,832
l've tolerated you
because of your sister!

1018
01:37:55,041 --> 01:37:58,832
What nonsense is this?
- This is no nonsense, but love!

1019
01:37:58,833 --> 01:38:00,999
Love? And you?

1020
01:38:01,208 --> 01:38:04,332
Vishal, just watch, someday..
- Spoken enough?

1021
01:38:04,750 --> 01:38:07,999
Now listen to me.
And stop acting stupid.

1022
01:38:08,208 --> 01:38:09,582
We're not children anymore.

1023
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:15,415
Why don't you understand this?

1024
01:38:16,583 --> 01:38:18,874
Control your youth, understand?

1025
01:39:02,666 --> 01:39:12,457
"Listen.."

1026
01:39:26,375 --> 01:39:33,749
"Listen, O crazy one,
your youth is very beautiful."

1027
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:37,415
"Your youth is very beautiful."

1028
01:39:37,416 --> 01:39:41,082
"This wet cIimate,
these dark clouds."

1029
01:39:41,083 --> 01:39:44,999
"The paths of love are siIent."

1030
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:48,749
"This is the time to love."

1031
01:39:48,750 --> 01:39:50,165
"Your youth.."

1032
01:39:52,458 --> 01:40:03,374
"Your youth is very beautiful."

1033
01:40:51,333 --> 01:40:58,915
"Ever since I saw your youth,
I've gone crazy."

1034
01:41:02,375 --> 01:41:06,040
"This atmosphere is asking you to"

1035
01:41:06,208 --> 01:41:10,040
"come into my arms,
as the weather is beautifuI."

1036
01:41:10,041 --> 01:41:13,707
"Give me some Iove,
give peace to my heart."

1037
01:41:13,708 --> 01:41:17,415
"My eyes are thirsty,
let me see you."

1038
01:41:24,708 --> 01:41:28,499
"You're so coIorful,
you're so beautiful."

1039
01:41:28,500 --> 01:41:32,207
"Beware of the world,
you're gorgeous."

1040
01:41:32,208 --> 01:41:35,790
"Everyone has a roving eye."

1041
01:41:35,791 --> 01:41:37,207
"Your youth.."

1042
01:41:39,583 --> 01:41:50,082
"Your youth is very beautiful."

1043
01:42:08,916 --> 01:42:16,290
"How long will you remain angry?
For how long can you avoid me?"

1044
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:27,374
"You'll crazily search for me,
when Iove casts its spelI."

1045
01:42:27,375 --> 01:42:31,165
"You're every heart's dream,
you're like a glass of wine."

1046
01:42:31,166 --> 01:42:35,124
"You're amazing. You're incredibIe."

1047
01:42:42,333 --> 01:42:45,999
"Your gait's lovely, the
world's crazy about you."

1048
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:49,665
"Everyone wants your grace."

1049
01:42:49,666 --> 01:42:53,332
"All are selfish."

1050
01:42:53,333 --> 01:43:04,249
"Your youth is very beautiful."

1051
01:43:04,250 --> 01:43:07,957
"This wet cIimate,
these dark clouds."

1052
01:43:08,166 --> 01:43:11,790
"The paths of love are siIent."

1053
01:43:11,791 --> 01:43:15,457
"This is the time to love."

1054
01:43:15,458 --> 01:43:26,249
"Your youth is very beautiful."

1055
01:43:51,208 --> 01:43:55,499
Vishal, did you make
Suraj stay in the stable?

1056
01:43:55,750 --> 01:43:57,874
Yes, uncle.
- Why?

1057
01:43:57,875 --> 01:44:02,499
Since Muskaan is at home.
- You become old-fashioned at times!

1058
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,999
He's a good boy. I know him.

1059
01:44:06,958 --> 01:44:08,957
Alright. As you wish!

1060
01:44:52,416 --> 01:44:53,832
Suraj!

1061
01:44:55,875 --> 01:44:58,332
I've been waiting
for you since so Iong.

1062
01:44:59,625 --> 01:45:01,707
What could I do? I had
to dodge brother and come.

1063
01:45:05,250 --> 01:45:06,499
Bloody brother!

1064
01:45:07,666 --> 01:45:09,374
Don't say a word against my brother.

1065
01:45:09,375 --> 01:45:13,874
Wow! You're
defending your brother a lot!

1066
01:45:13,875 --> 01:45:18,999
I'm brother's biggest responsibility.
He loves me a lot.

1067
01:45:19,500 --> 01:45:21,290
Yes, you're right!

1068
01:45:21,291 --> 01:45:25,415
Only brother's love is true,
mine isn't! - Enough, Suraj!

1069
01:45:25,416 --> 01:45:27,957
There's no need to get so emotional!
- l said you're right.

1070
01:45:28,625 --> 01:45:33,665
I've no value. I left everything and
came here! I've become a tourist!

1071
01:45:34,958 --> 01:45:37,665
You don't realize the
tension you've caused at home.

1072
01:45:37,666 --> 01:45:39,832
I've caused it!

1073
01:45:40,041 --> 01:45:43,165
Is it because of me or that bull?
- Spoken enough?

1074
01:45:49,375 --> 01:45:51,915
Even she? But it suits her!

1075
01:45:58,958 --> 01:46:07,332
"I'm in love with you,
beloved, my heart beats faster too."

1076
01:46:07,875 --> 01:46:10,249
"Because you're different."

1077
01:46:13,458 --> 01:46:22,374
"I'm in love with you, beloved,
my heart beats faster too."

1078
01:46:22,833 --> 01:46:25,415
"Because you're different."

1079
01:46:28,500 --> 01:46:37,165
"Be careful, in Iove
you might get beaten up!"

1080
01:46:37,666 --> 01:46:40,332
"Brother doesn't like you!"

1081
01:46:44,041 --> 01:46:52,499
"I'm in love with you, beloved,
my heart beats faster too."

1082
01:46:52,791 --> 01:46:55,332
"Because you're different."

1083
01:46:58,500 --> 01:47:07,332
"Be careful, in Iove
you might get beaten up!"

1084
01:47:07,750 --> 01:47:10,374
"Brother doesn't like you!"

1085
01:47:41,625 --> 01:47:53,915
"My brother will
make you toil hard."

1086
01:47:56,625 --> 01:48:08,749
"Get lost! Your brother too
wilI become helpless, if I wish."

1087
01:48:11,541 --> 01:48:19,415
"Whoever messes with me
wilI be hanged upside down."

1088
01:48:20,875 --> 01:48:23,707
"I'm different too."

1089
01:48:26,958 --> 01:48:35,415
"I'm in love with you, beloved,
my heart beats faster too."

1090
01:48:35,875 --> 01:48:38,457
"Because you're different."

1091
01:48:41,625 --> 01:48:49,332
"Be careful, in Iove
you might get beaten up!"

1092
01:48:50,833 --> 01:48:53,415
"Brother doesn't like you!"

1093
01:49:24,708 --> 01:49:31,540
"I want to attain you,
I've decided."

1094
01:49:32,208 --> 01:49:36,915
"Let anyone do anything."

1095
01:49:39,541 --> 01:49:46,957
"I'm with you too, my beloved."

1096
01:49:47,125 --> 01:49:51,999
"We'Il fight the worId bravely."

1097
01:49:54,666 --> 01:50:03,082
"But you'll have to pIease brother,
learn that by heart."

1098
01:50:03,958 --> 01:50:06,499
"Brother doesn't like you!"

1099
01:50:09,625 --> 01:50:18,749
"I'm in love with you, beloved,
my heart beats faster too."

1100
01:50:19,041 --> 01:50:21,457
"Because you're different."

1101
01:50:26,791 --> 01:50:35,499
"Your village is very lovely!
I've gone crazy after coming here."

1102
01:50:35,500 --> 01:50:41,624
Brother, I'm thinking of
settling here after marriage.

1103
01:50:42,875 --> 01:50:44,832
Alive or dead?

1104
01:50:47,458 --> 01:50:50,707
Wow! A village beIle!

1105
01:50:51,208 --> 01:50:54,624
Hi, girIs! How're you today?

1106
01:50:54,875 --> 01:50:57,374
Cool! You're Iooking pretty!

1107
01:50:58,291 --> 01:50:59,665
Bye, babes!

1108
01:50:59,958 --> 01:51:01,165
Bye.

1109
01:51:04,875 --> 01:51:06,874
What's this?
- What?

1110
01:51:07,250 --> 01:51:09,374
What kind of an act was this?
- Which one?

1111
01:51:16,041 --> 01:51:20,124
These girls are not my type!

1112
01:51:20,666 --> 01:51:23,040
I see. Then what's your type?

1113
01:51:34,500 --> 01:51:37,499
Get down!

1114
01:51:37,916 --> 01:51:39,082
Stop!

1115
01:51:40,041 --> 01:51:42,915
Stop, will you?
- You'll become my brother-in-law!

1116
01:51:42,916 --> 01:51:44,374
Want to see?
- Stop!

1117
01:52:46,416 --> 01:52:48,415
Who're you?
- Vijay Singh.

1118
01:52:48,666 --> 01:52:52,999
This is not your fight, but ours!

1119
01:52:53,250 --> 01:52:57,082
His fight is mine too!

1120
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:02,915
How many will you kill?

1121
01:53:06,500 --> 01:53:07,790
OnIy you!

1122
01:53:12,500 --> 01:53:14,374
I won't spare you! Let's go!

1123
01:53:25,833 --> 01:53:27,874
I won't spare you!
- Get lost!

1124
01:53:31,041 --> 01:53:33,540
Vijay Singh.
- Vishal Thakur.

1125
01:53:34,583 --> 01:53:35,790
Let me drop you home.

1126
01:53:36,958 --> 01:53:38,249
Idiots.

1127
01:53:49,166 --> 01:53:50,540
Please come in.

1128
01:53:50,541 --> 01:53:53,665
Some other time.
We'll keep meeting now.

1129
01:53:53,875 --> 01:53:55,624
Be carefuI.
- Why?

1130
01:53:56,083 --> 01:53:59,957
You're new here. And you've
made enemies because of me.

1131
01:54:01,166 --> 01:54:06,540
But I've also found
a friend Iike you.

1132
01:54:15,041 --> 01:54:16,499
She's my younger sister.

1133
01:54:22,666 --> 01:54:23,999
I'll leave.

1134
01:55:07,541 --> 01:55:09,582
What're you eating?

1135
01:55:10,458 --> 01:55:14,415
Grams? He feeds you grams
and makes me sleep here!

1136
01:55:16,708 --> 01:55:20,082
Stop all this! And Iet me sleep!

1137
01:55:20,958 --> 01:55:24,957
Keep a watch at night!

1138
01:55:27,333 --> 01:55:29,624
Didn't I ask you to
guard the fieIds at night?

1139
01:55:30,125 --> 01:55:32,999
You did ask! So?

1140
01:55:33,458 --> 01:55:34,707
Then what're you doing here?

1141
01:55:36,333 --> 01:55:38,707
l'm going!
- Take this.

1142
01:55:39,458 --> 01:55:41,749
For what?
- For your safety.

1143
01:55:42,291 --> 01:55:44,249
Really?
- Yes.

1144
01:55:44,541 --> 01:55:47,207
But why? - Because tigers
aIso roam there at night.

1145
01:55:48,708 --> 01:55:50,915
Tigers! Me!

1146
01:55:50,916 --> 01:55:52,957
Stick! Tiger!

1147
01:55:56,125 --> 01:55:57,499
Tigers!

1148
01:56:02,666 --> 01:56:07,207
"A head massage!"

1149
01:56:07,541 --> 01:56:12,249
"When you feel giddy,
or are depressed."

1150
01:56:12,750 --> 01:56:17,999
"Come to me, dear,
why do you worry?"

1151
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,207
"..why do you worry?"

1152
01:56:20,583 --> 01:56:22,999
"A head massage!"

1153
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,415
What's it, Muskaan?
You appear very happy today.

1154
01:56:25,666 --> 01:56:27,165
Obviously!

1155
01:56:27,458 --> 01:56:29,915
Ujala, who's the same age as me.

1156
01:56:30,125 --> 01:56:32,290
Amar Singh is coming
tomorrow to see my friend,

1157
01:56:33,041 --> 01:56:34,124
Why?

1158
01:56:34,458 --> 01:56:36,832
The colonel is
worried about her marriage.

1159
01:56:37,333 --> 01:56:41,415
Ujala is not a child anymore,
she has grown up like me.

1160
01:56:41,416 --> 01:56:44,040
Really?
- They'Il discuss her marriage.

1161
01:56:48,583 --> 01:56:51,165
You'll come, won't you?
- What wilI I do there?

1162
01:56:51,833 --> 01:56:53,290
What're you saying, brother?

1163
01:56:53,291 --> 01:56:55,874
Ujala has grown up only for you.
- What?

1164
01:56:55,875 --> 01:56:59,249
I mean, she has grown
up with you, with us.

1165
01:56:59,250 --> 01:57:00,540
We're from the bride's side!

1166
01:57:00,750 --> 01:57:02,082
You must be from the bride's side!

1167
01:57:03,291 --> 01:57:07,999
But we'lI have to see how
the boy is, what he does..

1168
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:09,957
..whether he'll keep
Ujala happy or not.

1169
01:57:23,791 --> 01:57:27,040
Ok, I've a Iot of work to do
for tomorrow. l'll Ieave now.

1170
01:57:27,041 --> 01:57:28,207
Ok.

1171
01:57:28,791 --> 01:57:30,665
Good night.
- Good night.

1172
01:57:42,500 --> 01:57:43,624
Any tension, brother?

1173
01:57:48,791 --> 01:57:50,207
Spoken enough?

1174
01:57:52,500 --> 01:57:54,374
How much does your daughter weigh?

1175
01:57:55,541 --> 01:58:01,332
What're you asking? She's
my daughter, not a goat!

1176
01:58:04,875 --> 01:58:06,040
Good lord!

1177
01:58:12,958 --> 01:58:14,457
Here comes the troubIe!

1178
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:24,832
Who's he?

1179
01:58:25,166 --> 01:58:28,124
He looks like the girl's uncIe!

1180
01:58:28,125 --> 01:58:30,165
Hey! Your father must be her uncle!

1181
01:58:30,458 --> 01:58:31,624
How can my father be her uncle?

1182
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:40,040
Vishal, don't do anything
that'Il ruin my daughter's Iife.

1183
01:58:40,041 --> 01:58:42,499
Sir, look at me!

1184
01:58:43,375 --> 01:58:45,165
What're you whispering?

1185
01:58:45,541 --> 01:58:48,165
Who's he, where has he
come from and why's he here?

1186
01:58:48,458 --> 01:58:52,624
Sir, he's Vishal Thakur.

1187
01:58:52,625 --> 01:58:56,040
A Iowly man compared to me!

1188
01:58:56,291 --> 01:58:58,082
Hey!
- What?

1189
01:58:59,458 --> 01:59:02,124
Shall we come to the point now?

1190
01:59:02,125 --> 01:59:08,957
Sir, I'm no match for you.

1191
01:59:09,375 --> 01:59:12,124
l'll not be able to
give you any dowry.

1192
01:59:12,375 --> 01:59:15,957
His family never takes dowry!

1193
01:59:16,541 --> 01:59:17,999
They only give!

1194
01:59:19,666 --> 01:59:22,624
Are you in such a bad state that..

1195
01:59:22,916 --> 01:59:25,165
..you'll marry your
daughter to these fools?

1196
01:59:25,750 --> 01:59:28,749
lnsult!
- What're you doing, brother?

1197
01:59:29,125 --> 01:59:31,665
Wedding bells will not
chime in this house now!

1198
01:59:32,583 --> 01:59:34,457
Get Iost! I've seen many like you!

1199
01:59:34,916 --> 01:59:37,040
Vishal, what're you doing?

1200
01:59:37,708 --> 01:59:40,790
If they go away, then
who'lI marry my daughter?

1201
01:59:40,958 --> 01:59:42,249
What does your daughter lack?

1202
01:59:44,041 --> 01:59:45,249
You'll find many.

1203
01:59:45,625 --> 01:59:47,999
You were the one who'd
always find faults in her.

1204
01:59:52,083 --> 01:59:54,540
Hey! Leave her hand!
- Quiet!

1205
01:59:55,833 --> 02:00:01,249
If he leaves her hand,
will you marry her?

1206
02:00:01,500 --> 02:00:02,957
Will you?

1207
02:00:03,750 --> 02:00:07,999
Answer, brother.
- Yes, answer!

1208
02:00:09,416 --> 02:00:14,915
What'll he say? People become
speechless before me!

1209
02:00:22,083 --> 02:00:25,540
TeIl me, Vishal.
What's your answer?

1210
02:00:26,625 --> 02:00:28,332
I'll marry you.

1211
02:00:32,083 --> 02:00:33,915
Hey! Spoken enough?

1212
02:00:35,875 --> 02:00:42,790
Brother!

1213
02:00:58,041 --> 02:01:02,290
Fantastic, Suraj! You massage
legs very welI! - Thank you, sir.

1214
02:01:03,916 --> 02:01:07,332
You know, a very affluent
man had come to see Ujala?

1215
02:01:07,500 --> 02:01:09,707
Yes, l do.

1216
02:01:10,583 --> 02:01:12,749
And brother Vishal drove them away.

1217
02:01:14,750 --> 02:01:17,915
You know how our Vishal is!

1218
02:01:18,208 --> 02:01:22,999
It's obvious from this that
he must be loving Ujala a Iot.

1219
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:25,040
Yes, he does.

1220
02:01:25,333 --> 02:01:28,665
Don't you feeI you
should taIk to the colonel..

1221
02:01:28,875 --> 02:01:31,040
..and get Vishal and Ujala married?

1222
02:01:31,041 --> 02:01:32,749
But it'll be futile, Suraj.

1223
02:01:33,041 --> 02:01:40,165
I know he won't get married
until a match is found for Muskaan.

1224
02:01:40,750 --> 02:01:45,582
Does it imply that he and not you,
will find a groom for Muskaan?

1225
02:01:45,583 --> 02:01:47,290
No, that's not the case.

1226
02:01:47,750 --> 02:01:51,082
I know that they'lI never refuse me.

1227
02:01:51,583 --> 02:01:55,082
But I've bestowed
this right to Vishal.

1228
02:02:02,166 --> 02:02:04,207
What's wrong?
- Nothing.

1229
02:02:04,500 --> 02:02:05,874
Just a pain in the neck.

1230
02:02:06,166 --> 02:02:07,415
Come here.
- No, sir!

1231
02:02:07,416 --> 02:02:10,040
I'Il massage it.
- Please leave me, sir!

1232
02:02:11,583 --> 02:02:12,957
Strange!

1233
02:02:13,916 --> 02:02:17,499
Hey! Come here!

1234
02:02:17,500 --> 02:02:19,540
Oh no!

1235
02:03:00,958 --> 02:03:02,957
Are you in a bad mood?
Shall I tell you a joke?

1236
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,624
Once it so happened that..

1237
02:03:22,125 --> 02:03:24,124
What kind of a joke is this?

1238
02:03:24,666 --> 02:03:27,374
This is not a joke, but a test.

1239
02:03:32,125 --> 02:03:33,790
This is insanity, Vishal!

1240
02:03:33,791 --> 02:03:37,665
Even you could never control
this wild horse and that poor boy..

1241
02:03:49,375 --> 02:03:50,582
Wild..

1242
02:03:50,583 --> 02:03:55,165
Wild isn't pronounced like that!
At least stammer properly!

1243
02:03:55,166 --> 02:03:58,374
That..
- Wild!

1244
02:04:01,833 --> 02:04:03,957
Who asked him to
mount this wild horse?

1245
02:04:05,125 --> 02:04:06,957
Is this your prank?
- No uncle.

1246
02:04:07,541 --> 02:04:10,082
He thinks he's a great rider.

1247
02:04:13,875 --> 02:04:15,790
Suraj! Are you alright?

1248
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,124
He's a strong boy.

1249
02:04:20,333 --> 02:04:23,624
Hey, you! Why are you
being nasty with me?

1250
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:27,749
I know you're smitten by that mare.

1251
02:04:29,083 --> 02:04:32,249
What that fool hasn't done
for you in so many years,

1252
02:04:32,583 --> 02:04:34,999
I'll do it for you in 5 minutes!

1253
02:04:35,208 --> 02:04:37,124
Tonight after the lights go off.

1254
02:04:37,125 --> 02:04:40,040
What's he taIking?
- Even I'm smitten.

1255
02:04:41,833 --> 02:04:46,207
Please let me mount you, my love!
It's a matter of honour.

1256
02:04:46,208 --> 02:04:48,165
What's he whispering to the horse?

1257
02:04:48,416 --> 02:04:49,915
Say yes!

1258
02:04:49,916 --> 02:04:51,957
Wow! Good!

1259
02:05:08,666 --> 02:05:09,874
Good!

1260
02:05:16,041 --> 02:05:17,665
Fantastic, Suraj!

1261
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,540
Even we couldn't get a hold on
this horse. - Thank you, sir.

1262
02:05:20,833 --> 02:05:22,707
Love possesses great strength.

1263
02:05:24,750 --> 02:05:27,790
Yes, it does.

1264
02:05:29,375 --> 02:05:31,707
This horse belongs
to you from now on.

1265
02:05:32,208 --> 02:05:33,790
Thank you, sir.

1266
02:05:59,125 --> 02:06:11,040
"I'm madly in love with you."

1267
02:06:24,375 --> 02:06:30,040
"l'm lost in your love,
I've forgotten myself, my beloved."

1268
02:06:30,041 --> 02:06:45,957
"I'm madly in love with you."

1269
02:06:46,750 --> 02:06:50,790
"We're not concerned
about the worId."

1270
02:06:50,791 --> 02:07:07,874
"What's there to fear
when we love each other?"

1271
02:07:08,333 --> 02:07:24,207
"You're madly in love with me."

1272
02:07:25,250 --> 02:07:29,207
"We're not concerned
about the worId."

1273
02:07:29,208 --> 02:07:46,082
"What's there to fear
when we love each other?"

1274
02:07:46,875 --> 02:07:55,249
"I'm madly in love with you."

1275
02:08:28,291 --> 02:08:36,040
"This heart was alone and lost."

1276
02:08:36,416 --> 02:08:44,082
"There was restIessness,
the heart was silent."

1277
02:08:44,500 --> 02:08:59,707
"Ever since I've found you,
all complaints have disappeared."

1278
02:09:00,291 --> 02:09:05,999
"I too have decided
that I'Il marry you."

1279
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:13,915
"You're madly in love with me."

1280
02:09:14,250 --> 02:09:18,540
"We're not concerned
about the worId."

1281
02:09:18,541 --> 02:09:35,790
"What's there to fear
when we love each other?"

1282
02:09:36,125 --> 02:09:44,457
"I'm madly in love with you."

1283
02:10:25,750 --> 02:10:33,499
"Oh god, these eyes
say a thousand things."

1284
02:10:33,791 --> 02:10:41,374
"Wonder what magic this is,
my heart is out of control."

1285
02:10:41,875 --> 02:10:57,332
"I always pray to
god to attain you."

1286
02:10:57,750 --> 02:11:03,290
"Give me the adoration of love, make
an auspicious beginning, beloved."

1287
02:11:03,291 --> 02:11:11,415
"I'm madly in love with you."

1288
02:11:11,875 --> 02:11:15,999
"We're not concerned
about the worId."

1289
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:32,749
"What's there to fear
when we love each other?"

1290
02:11:33,583 --> 02:11:42,207
"I'm madly in love with you."

1291
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:53,624
Vijay Singh, I'm very
pleased to meet you.

1292
02:11:54,666 --> 02:11:58,290
You've rescued Vishal.
Do keep coming here.

1293
02:11:58,708 --> 02:12:02,332
Yes. Everything will be fine
once the land dispute is solved.

1294
02:12:02,916 --> 02:12:07,290
Land dispute?
I know many people here.

1295
02:12:07,875 --> 02:12:11,124
I'll be very glad to
be of any help to you.

1296
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:13,749
Thank you very much.

1297
02:12:14,625 --> 02:12:15,874
Vishal, l'll Ieave now.

1298
02:12:16,125 --> 02:12:17,540
Greetings.
- Bless you.

1299
02:12:17,750 --> 02:12:19,790
Uncle, I'Il see him off.
- Okay.

1300
02:12:27,708 --> 02:12:28,999
Okay.

1301
02:12:37,708 --> 02:12:38,999
He's a good boy.

1302
02:12:39,708 --> 02:12:41,415
How's he for Muskaan?

1303
02:12:43,250 --> 02:12:47,665
What? Are you saying this?
- Yes, uncle.

1304
02:12:48,625 --> 02:12:51,499
Do you Iike him?
- I approve of the boy.

1305
02:12:54,125 --> 02:12:56,207
Fine. We'lI talk to his parents.

1306
02:12:56,625 --> 02:13:00,790
This is incredible! You've
chosen a boy for Muskaan today!

1307
02:13:01,250 --> 02:13:02,790
Fantastic!

1308
02:13:13,708 --> 02:13:14,999
Suraj!

1309
02:13:29,666 --> 02:13:33,332
I did everything
possible to win over Vishal.

1310
02:13:34,416 --> 02:13:38,749
But today, he has chosen
somebody eIse for you.

1311
02:14:45,125 --> 02:14:46,249
Dear.

1312
02:15:25,291 --> 02:15:28,207
Hey! I hope you're not hurt.

1313
02:15:30,333 --> 02:15:31,499
Come.

1314
02:15:33,250 --> 02:15:34,415
Father.

1315
02:15:34,416 --> 02:15:37,415
If your company works in
collaboration with ours..

1316
02:15:37,708 --> 02:15:40,582
..then we'Il fix our son Suraj's
alliance with your daughter.

1317
02:15:44,541 --> 02:15:46,290
It's not a bad deal, Mr. Malhotra.

1318
02:15:46,291 --> 02:15:47,915
Think about it.
- Hello. Who's speaking?

1319
02:15:48,083 --> 02:15:50,249
Suraj. Give the phone to father.
- Just a minute, sir.

1320
02:15:50,875 --> 02:15:52,332
Sir.

1321
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:54,082
Hello.

1322
02:15:54,416 --> 02:15:58,249
Daddy, this is Suraj.
- Yes, Suraj!

1323
02:15:58,875 --> 02:16:00,999
How're you?
- Fine. And how're you?

1324
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:02,957
I need you.
- Why?

1325
02:16:03,541 --> 02:16:06,249
Have you finished your money?
Shall I send some?

1326
02:16:06,458 --> 02:16:10,457
No. I don't need money, l need you.

1327
02:16:11,791 --> 02:16:13,957
What's the matter,
Suraj? Is everything okay?

1328
02:16:14,250 --> 02:16:15,415
Dear..

1329
02:16:15,666 --> 02:16:20,082
Dear, your dad is in the midst
of a very important meeting.

1330
02:16:20,291 --> 02:16:23,457
Call up later, okay? HeIlo!

1331
02:16:24,041 --> 02:16:25,207
Hello!
- You..

1332
02:16:25,583 --> 02:16:26,749
What happened?

1333
02:16:26,750 --> 02:16:27,790
Disconnected.
- Disconnected?

1334
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:29,415
Take this inside.

1335
02:16:34,916 --> 02:16:38,582
What're you doing? Why are you
destroying my phone booth?

1336
02:16:38,583 --> 02:16:39,915
Sir..
- Move!

1337
02:16:40,083 --> 02:16:41,082
Move!

1338
02:17:20,583 --> 02:17:22,957
Being an elder brother,
I used to think that

1339
02:17:23,666 --> 02:17:26,207
I had the right to make
every decision regarding Muskaan.

1340
02:17:27,291 --> 02:17:30,790
That she'd be happy with every
decision I take, but it isn't so.

1341
02:17:34,458 --> 02:17:36,290
I don't quite understand.

1342
02:17:36,958 --> 02:17:39,249
Vijay, I don't want to
beat around the bush.

1343
02:17:40,291 --> 02:17:42,957
l need some more
time regarding Muskaan.

1344
02:17:44,458 --> 02:17:48,290
I understand, Vishal. It's the
question of Muskaan's life.

1345
02:17:49,500 --> 02:17:53,165
Even if it takes some
more time, I've no problem.

1346
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:56,540
But she should be
happy with your decision.

1347
02:17:57,666 --> 02:18:00,415
Thank you. I expected
this from you.

1348
02:18:06,375 --> 02:18:10,874
What a plan it was!
- That was great!

1349
02:18:10,875 --> 02:18:13,290
Wealth, wife and Iand!

1350
02:18:16,041 --> 02:18:17,499
What's the matter with you?

1351
02:18:17,666 --> 02:18:20,957
Father, it's time to scoot!
- What?

1352
02:18:39,666 --> 02:18:43,665
Vijay, I'm not surprised
at you, but at myself..

1353
02:18:44,291 --> 02:18:46,749
..as to how I could fail
to recognize a person.

1354
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:50,082
Now you know to what extent
we can go to achieve our goal.

1355
02:18:51,375 --> 02:18:55,415
You've already crossed all Iimits
by just thinking about Muskaan.

1356
02:18:56,166 --> 02:18:57,624
Vishal Thakur!

1357
02:18:59,500 --> 02:19:01,957
This is just the beginning.
- ReaIly?

1358
02:19:05,875 --> 02:19:07,290
Then even I'm prepared.

1359
02:19:13,166 --> 02:19:16,874
Son, what've you done?
You've declared war!

1360
02:19:17,041 --> 02:19:21,957
Brother, you don't know them.
MuscIe power is all they know!

1361
02:19:22,125 --> 02:19:23,915
Perhaps, I don't know them.

1362
02:19:25,291 --> 02:19:26,957
But I do know their weakness.

1363
02:22:10,291 --> 02:22:14,457
Muskaan, I trusted you impIicitly.

1364
02:22:16,875 --> 02:22:22,540
You've caused me immense
grief by hiding this from me.

1365
02:22:23,375 --> 02:22:25,290
You've given me a big shock.

1366
02:22:43,125 --> 02:22:45,082
Please forgive me, uncle.

1367
02:22:46,458 --> 02:22:48,082
I've hurt you.

1368
02:22:56,875 --> 02:22:58,499
But you teIl me, uncle.

1369
02:23:03,833 --> 02:23:05,665
What else couId I do?

1370
02:23:18,416 --> 02:23:19,915
Uncle,

1371
02:23:20,916 --> 02:23:22,415
we've committed a big folly.

1372
02:23:23,750 --> 02:23:25,415
Please forgive us.

1373
02:23:50,250 --> 02:23:59,207
Suraj.

1374
02:24:05,375 --> 02:24:08,665
Where've you come from?
- I'm Akash Khanna, Suraj's father.

1375
02:24:09,083 --> 02:24:10,499
They're my parents.

1376
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:14,790
We searched for you everywhere.

1377
02:24:15,708 --> 02:24:17,457
Your friends have
told us everything.

1378
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:19,790
I had left home long back.

1379
02:24:21,083 --> 02:24:26,165
But how did you remember
me after so many days?

1380
02:24:26,416 --> 02:24:28,624
What do you mean by that?

1381
02:24:29,375 --> 02:24:30,790
You've always..
- Son.

1382
02:24:30,791 --> 02:24:34,249
We've fixed your alliance with
the richest family in India.

1383
02:24:34,625 --> 02:24:36,624
lt must've been
a big business deal.

1384
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:38,124
Talk sense, Suraj.

1385
02:24:39,625 --> 02:24:40,832
Dad.

1386
02:24:41,541 --> 02:24:45,665
What's surprising is that this
is where I've come to my senses.

1387
02:24:48,125 --> 02:24:49,999
We'll be left nowhere if..

1388
02:24:50,416 --> 02:24:54,207
Your aIliance can never
get fixed with this family!

1389
02:24:54,875 --> 02:24:56,999
We're poles apart!

1390
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:01,790
Mrs. Khanna.
- Suraj!

1391
02:25:02,500 --> 02:25:05,165
You've forgotten that
she's your mother. - No, dad.

1392
02:25:06,458 --> 02:25:08,040
She's a mother only for namesake.

1393
02:25:09,500 --> 02:25:14,040
And the peopIe whom she's taIking
about are not rich like you..

1394
02:25:15,041 --> 02:25:16,957
..but they're far more
respectabIe than she is.

1395
02:25:17,375 --> 02:25:21,665
My foot! Can I meet the girl
from that respectable family..

1396
02:25:21,666 --> 02:25:24,624
..who's responsible for
all the trouble? Where's she?

1397
02:25:41,541 --> 02:25:42,915
Hey..

1398
02:25:44,125 --> 02:25:46,207
I stopped him, madam.

1399
02:25:47,375 --> 02:25:52,374
But if you say a word
more against Muskaan..

1400
02:25:53,416 --> 02:25:55,374
..then nobody will
be able to stop me!

1401
02:26:00,500 --> 02:26:05,415
Muskaan, wait!

1402
02:26:05,791 --> 02:26:07,040
Muskaan.

1403
02:26:25,375 --> 02:26:27,374
We've come here to
take our son Suraj..

1404
02:26:27,666 --> 02:26:31,207
..whom you've trapped in
your daughter farcical love!

1405
02:26:34,125 --> 02:26:37,832
Don't consider our toIerance
to be our weakness, Mr. Khanna!

1406
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:42,207
It'll be wise if you Ieave quickly!
- UncIe.. - C'mon.

1407
02:26:42,208 --> 02:26:44,749
Vijay Singh has abducted Muskaan!

1408
02:26:47,833 --> 02:26:49,915
No! You won't go anywhere!

1409
02:26:50,833 --> 02:26:53,874
Dad. I love Muskaan a lot!

1410
02:26:53,875 --> 02:26:57,082
And l love you a lot!
I don't want to lose you again!

1411
02:26:57,875 --> 02:26:59,374
Then become the same
father as before!

1412
02:27:00,791 --> 02:27:03,457
What're you doing?
This is not our fight.

1413
02:27:03,708 --> 02:27:05,165
Let him go if he wants to.

1414
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:18,457
You always complained that
I left things incomplete.

1415
02:27:18,666 --> 02:27:20,124
Today l'll complete it.

1416
02:27:35,666 --> 02:27:36,957
Uncle!

1417
02:27:37,750 --> 02:27:39,040
Brother!

1418
02:27:39,833 --> 02:27:41,832
Go and beat them!

1419
02:27:54,333 --> 02:27:55,582
Uncle!

1420
02:28:02,791 --> 02:28:03,832
Go!

1421
02:28:12,708 --> 02:28:13,915
Suraj!

1422
02:28:49,416 --> 02:28:50,582
Uncle!

1423
02:28:53,083 --> 02:28:55,457
Leave me!

1424
02:30:05,750 --> 02:30:11,749
I told you!
If you play dirty again..

1425
02:30:12,375 --> 02:30:17,290
I'lI take the decision,
not the village committee!

1426
02:30:28,083 --> 02:30:29,415
Father, come on!

1427
02:30:29,416 --> 02:30:34,999
Can you drive the tractor?
- Yes!

1428
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:36,165
Come on!

1429
02:30:36,166 --> 02:30:38,332
Left! Right! Turn right!

1430
02:30:39,458 --> 02:30:41,082
Take aim! Fire!

1431
02:30:41,083 --> 02:30:45,207
He has a gun! Move aside!

1432
02:30:47,041 --> 02:30:48,332
I'm dead!

1433
02:31:42,916 --> 02:31:47,249
Isn't she everybody's
darling and weakness?

1434
02:31:55,583 --> 02:31:56,790
Brother!

1435
02:31:58,916 --> 02:32:00,665
Uncle!

1436
02:32:04,250 --> 02:32:05,624
Suraj!

1437
02:32:56,708 --> 02:32:57,999
Oh no!

1438
02:33:00,208 --> 02:33:02,582
Hit him! Help!

1439
02:33:02,916 --> 02:33:05,582
What's happening!

1440
02:33:05,583 --> 02:33:06,957
Father, the police have aIso come!

1441
02:33:07,750 --> 02:33:09,332
What're you thinking about now?

1442
02:33:09,625 --> 02:33:12,790
Don't worry. I'll have a
village committee meeting again.

1443
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:14,415
Go ahead, but in prison!

1444
02:33:14,583 --> 02:33:17,707
Quiet!
- You keep quiet! - Shut up!

1445
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:36,999
"I'm madly in love with you."

1446
02:35:37,666 --> 02:35:41,749
"We're not concerned
about the worId."

1447
02:35:41,750 --> 02:35:58,790
"What's there to fear
when we love each other?"

1448
02:35:59,333 --> 02:36:15,332
"You're madly in love with me."

1449
02:36:15,833 --> 02:36:20,207
"We're not concerned
about the worId."

1450
02:36:20,208 --> 02:36:36,957
"What's there to fear
when we love each other?"
