What music?

31
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:49,569
Music of the maestro... Great Goopynath

32
00:02:50,129 --> 00:02:52,759
A farmer you are...
A maestro l become

33
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,930
Come fiver, come to my hand!

34
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:02,770
lt's going to be a fiver... it's going to be... a fiver...fiver...

My goodness! You?

l salute you lords

37
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:11,590
Looks like the second Pandava with his club!

38
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:15,710
What's this?

39
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,330

A great thingto have

42
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,159
What price it is?

43
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:29,490
Well... Gosain uncle of Panchpur... it belongs to him
only

44
00:03:29,969 --> 00:03:31,669
Pallab Gosain?
-Yes Sirs

45
00:03:31,969 --> 00:03:35,479
But he is a maestro
-That he is!

46
00:03:36,409 --> 00:03:41,210
Eveymorning he's busypractising his lessons... and
well, l havethat penchant,too...

47
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:45,860
forthe lastfewdays, l've been keenlyfollowing his
Iessons...

48
00:03:46,419 --> 00:03:52,810
l saw that he has two tanpuras... one for his use... and
the other lies idle in the corner.

49
00:03:53,729 --> 00:03:58,969
Todayl managedto ask him ifhewould give methat
one... one he doesn't use...

50
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,139
... he said, ''Good God! That one is doomed

51
00:04:03,699 --> 00:04:05,919
But l said it could serve mypurpose.

52
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,090
Then he said, ''Why will l give it away for free?''

53
00:04:08,509 --> 00:04:12,349
l said I was just a poor shopkeeper; where would l get
the money?

54
00:04:13,009 --> 00:04:15,199
He said, ''Do my work.'' l asked what kind of work

55
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:18,420
He asked me to blend the tobacco in the hookah for
him, and l did.

56
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:20,899
Asked me to massage his feet, and l also did that.

57
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:24,810
Then he asked me to draw water from the well. l did.

58
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,759
''Kill the rats in the storeroom,'' he said, and l did.

59
00:04:29,329 --> 00:04:31,699
Such huge rats, you won't believe. One blow with the
bamboo stick and they...

60
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,079
Oh, it's alright!

61
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:37,310
And so he gave you this.
-Yes Sirs

62
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:43,000
Pulled the ears himself, and handed it to me. Even now
my ears hurt

63
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:46,459
What do you say?Your ears?

64
00:04:46,879 --> 00:09:33,338
Both my ear and this fellow's.

65
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:57,170
He said, ''Music lies both in your and your instrument's
ears. When you pull them both,they create harmony!''

66
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:02,019
Oh, harmony! Absolutely right!

67
00:05:02,829 --> 00:05:05,439
Do one thing, boy... sing a number for us.

68
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:08,180
Let's test both the instrument and its owner.

69
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:10,750
Sing, shall l?
-Of course you must.

70
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:16,160
But l know only one song, my lords.
-Sing that one only

71
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:19,430
No need to sing something heavy

72
00:05:19,779 --> 00:05:24,560
Well, actually... it's a song of the dawn, but dawn seems
to be over now.

73
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:28,149
Of course it's still there. Dawn doesn't run away like
that. You start.

74
00:05:28,649 --> 00:05:35,889
The shadow of this stick... as long as it doesn't touch
that stone... dawn is still there.

75
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:37,779
You sing

76
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:39,660
So, shall l?
-Yes, sure

77
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,040
Keep a watch on that shadow, my lords
-Oh sure

78
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:50,740
l become lost in my song.
-Don't you worry. Just sing.

79
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,259
Behold!

80
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:11,680
With eyes wide open

81
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,959
The beauty of this wor...

82
00:06:16,569 --> 00:06:19,379
But Dawn is overl.

83
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:30,100
The time was too short! If l had a few more minutes, l
could have sung the whole song.

84
00:06:30,949 --> 00:06:33,319
Look here Gopinath

85
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,610
You do one thing

86
00:06:39,089 --> 00:06:42,839
Our Raja...
-The King,you know

87
00:06:44,230 --> 00:13:27,069
He's a connoisseur of music

88
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,329
Very patronising!

89
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:55,459
You go and sing your song in front of him.

90
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,339
Oh what are you telling me, my lords?Why will they allow
me inside the palace?

91
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:06,269
But, why do you need to enter?

92
00:07:08,149 --> 00:07:10,319
Your song will enter.

93
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:14,769
And enter it will... right into the King's ears!

94
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,930
Straight through the ears,
The heart it will pierce

95
00:07:22,069 --> 00:07:24,699
lf only you would suggest how it's going to be possible

96
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,730
The King is an early riser

97
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:35,029
Be there right before daybreak(coughs)... Beside the
wall you will find a broken... (coughs)...

98
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,329
A broken temple

99
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:45,300
Sitting there and facing the palace...

100
00:07:46,160 --> 00:15:31,460
Just start crooning...

101
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,230
... and see what happens next

102
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:52,430
But what might happen, mylords?

103
00:07:53,899 --> 00:08:02,160
Listen. When the King asks your name,tell him your
name is Gopinath Gayen

104
00:08:03,509 --> 00:08:04,180
Gayen!

105
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:08,980
He that sings
Is called a'Gayen'

106
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,110
Gayen!

107
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:46,070
You said l sing out of tune, but the babus of the village
praised me a lot. l performed before them.They were
telling...

108
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:48,090
What were they telling?

109
00:08:49,549 --> 00:08:50,509
Nothing

110
00:08:51,059 --> 00:08:54,370
Did God stuff enough grey matter in your head that you
would understand their mockery?

111
00:08:55,259 --> 00:08:59,100
This poor father's simple words were not enough for
you; you went for the opinion of those babus!

112
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:03,870
So excited you are about their 'praises' that you didn't
even care to do some housework!

113
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:08,399
What do you think of yourself? Off to the shop, right
now!

114
00:09:10,139 --> 00:09:14,500
lf l even hear the word 'music' from tomorrow, l'll
smash that tanpura to pieces! Wild beast!

115
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,139
Behold!

116
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,679
Behold!

117
00:10:57,379 --> 00:11:00,889
Behold
With eyes wide open

118
00:11:01,549 --> 00:11:04,950
The beauty of this world

119
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:09,200
The beauty of this world!

120
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:12,509
The beauty of this world!

121
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:21,639
Darkness fades
As Dawn unfurls

122
00:11:27,909 --> 00:11:29,080
Guard!

123
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:30,519
Guard, my foot!

124
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:32,600
Yes Sir?

125
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:36,169
Whoever is yelling outside, bring him inside!
-Okay Sir

126
00:11:37,059 --> 00:11:37,909
Go!

127
00:11:44,659 --> 00:11:46,029
Come on, let's go
-Where?

128
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,179
To the palace

129
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,000
lnside the palace?
-Yes, absolutely

130
00:11:51,539 --> 00:11:53,909
Did the King call me?
-Oh yes, he did.

131
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:57,629
Did he hear mysong?
-Oh yes, he heard

132
00:11:58,139 --> 00:12:01,240

Gopinath Gayen

139
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,179
Why were you yelling?

140
00:12:39,549 --> 00:12:41,600
Why were you yelling? Why? Why?
-Why? Why?

141
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,429
Well, l didn't really yell... Sir.

142
00:12:46,059 --> 00:12:48,549
l just sang the morning Raaga.

143
00:12:54,929 --> 00:12:55,799

Got it from Gosain uncle of Pashpukur.

147
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:13,759
Do you know the octave?

148
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:16,809
Well...
-The seven notes of music. Do you know the seven
notes?

149
00:13:17,259 --> 00:13:18,309
Yes Sir

150
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:20,820
What is the third note?

151
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,659
Ga!

152
00:13:23,529 --> 00:13:24,929
Sixth note?

153
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,129
Dha

154
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:29,120
Put together,what do they mean?

Put together...

Put him on a donkey and throw him out of this village!

157
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:49,529
On the orders of the King...

158
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:55,460
Gopinath Gayen is being ousted from this Amlaki
village

159

After dark, in the woods
If the tiger comes

So, are you supposed to come from Shundi or
Baghdad?

336
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:56,230
No, Minister

337
00:42:57,030 --> 00:42:59,250
What about the preparations for war?

338
00:42:59,969 --> 00:43:01,019
Nothing, sir

339
00:43:03,409 --> 00:43:04,989
Nothing?
-Nothing

340
00:43:05,679 --> 00:43:06,409
Armour and artillery?

341
00:43:07,139 --> 00:43:07,780
No

342
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:10,019
No weapons?
-No

343
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:13,599
Soldiers?
-Not even soldiers

344
00:43:14,179 --> 00:43:15,820
Not even soldiers?
-No

345
00:43:16,289 --> 00:43:19,039
What do the people do? Bundle hay for horses?

346
00:43:19,659 --> 00:43:20,619
Not even horses

347
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:24,650
No horses?And elephants?

348
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:26,179
Not either

349
00:43:26,929 --> 00:43:27,690
Camels?

350
00:43:27,829 --> 00:43:28,590
Nor camels

351
00:43:29,369 --> 00:43:30,599
Nothing?

352
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:40,710
Wonderful!

353
00:43:41,179 --> 00:43:42,960
No preparations for war!

354
00:43:43,849 --> 00:43:45,309
So what is there, will you tell?

355
00:43:46,949 --> 00:43:48,789
Crops on the fields

356
00:43:49,449 --> 00:43:51,530
Fruits on the trees

357
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:53,349
flowers

358
00:43:54,159 --> 00:43:55,090
Birds

359
00:43:55,829 --> 00:43:58,079
There is peace all around

360
00:43:58,929 --> 00:44:00,159
Happiness

361
00:44:00,599 --> 00:44:01,420
SmiIesl.

362
00:44:02,429 --> 00:44:03,889
What a wonderfuI country.

363
00:44:08,599 --> 00:44:09,829
Look at the harvest.

364
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:13,739
Somewhere a flute is playing

365
00:44:22,690 --> 00:44:23,539
Hey there!

366
00:44:25,619 --> 00:44:27,369
ls this land called Shundi?

367
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:31,760
Which way is the King's palace, can you tell us?

368
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:39,389
ls he dumb?
-Deaf... deaf. Come on

369
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:56,199
Can you show us the way to the King's palace?

370
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:58,039
The King's palace... palace

371
00:45:58,809 --> 00:45:59,889
The King's palace

372
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:54,500
Wow!

373
00:46:54,969 --> 00:46:55,760
How beautiful.

374
00:46:58,739 --> 00:47:00,699
Will the music contest be held there?

375
00:47:06,050 --> 01:34:07,199
Text

376
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:08,889
We've eaten a lot.We're full now.

377
00:47:09,750 --> 00:47:11,590
We don't have money also. Poor as we are!

378
00:47:13,590 --> 00:47:14,610
You're giving it for free?

379
00:47:17,789 --> 00:47:19,690
You are really a good person

380
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:22,659
Don't you talk?

381
00:47:24,329 --> 00:47:25,289
Dumb?

382
00:47:37,679 --> 00:47:38,969
Let's go

383
00:47:40,019 --> 00:47:41,510
lf they don't allow us inside?

384
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:44,429
Why're you so scared? Let's give it a try

385
00:49:10,110 --> 00:49:13,150
Stop all this scampering of yours. Take your seat. We'll
talk.

386
00:49:40,969 --> 00:49:45,010
The way yourmagic is going... how long will you be
there?

387
00:49:48,039 --> 00:49:49,000
Three days?

388
00:50:00,159 --> 00:50:01,530
Then we don't have much time.

389
00:50:02,590 --> 00:50:04,760
We have to finish everything by then

390
00:50:09,699 --> 00:50:10,599
Listen Barrfi

391
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:13,909
lt's becoming almost mandatory to conquer Shundi

392
00:50:14,739 --> 00:50:18,400
Like a ripe fruit just at your arm's length.... only needs
to be plucked!

393
00:50:20,309 --> 00:50:24,670
But if the people are mute as you, is it possible to rule
such a country?

394
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:32,840
lf they don't convey their wish, is it possible to prevent
them from getting what they want?

395
00:50:37,389 --> 00:50:40,519
So, it's time for you to show your wizardry.

396
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:47,230
Make a strong medicine,that will prompt all of those
fellows to start chattering

397
00:51:06,889 --> 00:51:07,880
Can you do that?

398
00:51:09,889 --> 00:51:11,909
l want it by tomorrow

399
00:51:25,369 --> 00:51:28,909
Come on, let's visit the King for the Shundi thing

400
00:51:32,409 --> 00:51:32,929
What?

401
00:55:28,849 --> 01:47:01,778
O Emperor

402
00:55:29,519 --> 00:55:40,010
O Emperor

403
00:55:42,030 --> 00:55:46,389
We salute you
Salute!
Salute!

404
00:55:47,699 --> 00:55:52,059
We hail from the land of Bengal

405
00:55:54,639 --> 00:55:59,000
We hail from the land of Bengal

406
00:56:13,659 --> 00:56:20,019
We're just simpletons
Visiting places and lands

407
00:56:24,170 --> 00:56:30,239
We're just simpletons
Visiting places and lands

408
00:56:31,309 --> 00:56:37,639
We know no language
Other than our own

409
00:56:41,590 --> 00:56:47,449
We know no language
Other than our own

410
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:51,780
O Emperor!

411
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:54,050
O Mr. King!

412
00:56:55,070 --> 00:56:59,050
But some other language we know...

413
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:10,630
Proud to tell you so
We've come only for that, O king!

414
00:57:12,289 --> 00:57:15,329
But some other language we know...

415
00:57:16,059 --> 00:57:24,210
Proud to tell you so
We've come this far, O king.

416
00:57:25,929 --> 00:57:28,099
O Emperor!

417
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:41,989
That language is our song

418
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:48,809
Hear us with heart and soul, O King!

419
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:03,000
The language of melody, of rhythm...

420
00:58:06,510 --> 00:58:09,789
That of beats, of happiness...

421
00:58:13,250 --> 00:58:19,320
The language of melody, of rhythm, of beats, of
happiness

422
00:58:21,190 --> 00:58:24,789
The language it speaks
Understand all and sundry

423
00:58:28,530 --> 00:58:31,489
Understand all and sundry
This language of music

424
00:58:31,969 --> 00:58:40,349
The rich,the poor,the high,the low
Are all equal
Before this language, O King!
Sing we in this language

425
00:58:41,579 --> 00:58:44,619
We sing in this very language

426
00:58:45,150 --> 00:58:46,380
Sing,we do...

427
00:58:46,679 --> 00:58:51,280
O Emperor

428
00:58:51,989 --> 00:58:54,599
Salute to you!

429
00:59:10,210 --> 00:59:13,369
War! War!
-War!

430
00:59:13,909 --> 00:59:16,570
l want war!

431
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:19,869
War!
-Yes war

432
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:29,409
Did you send the messenger?
-What?

433
00:59:29,829 --> 00:59:33,230
Was the messenger to Shundi sent for announcing
war?
- ''What''!

434
00:59:33,829 --> 00:59:35,820
He'll go tomorrow
-Tomorrow

435
00:59:38,769 --> 00:59:40,880
ls the army ready?
-Yes, l've got it announced by the drum

436
00:59:41,369 --> 00:59:45,730
Drums! Drums! All this nonsense!

437
00:59:46,739 --> 00:59:49,170
The spy brought the news today itself

438
00:59:53,320 --> 01:00:00,269
Besides,we have to collect the taxes... quite a strenuous
job... and it is not practically possible to start war at such
short notice.

439
01:00:01,489 --> 01:00:06,940
Why are you whispering? My ears tickle.Whatever you
say, say it loudly.
-Yes Sir

440
01:00:08,429 --> 01:00:09,860
Yes Maharaj

441
01:00:11,699 --> 01:00:13,309
Where's the General?

442
01:00:16,170 --> 01:00:17,190
General

443
01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:31,460
Why areyou putting on weight?

444
01:00:32,519 --> 01:00:33,659
Well, from the beginning, he is...

445
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:36,849
From the beginning he is...

446
01:00:39,329 --> 01:00:40,909
Do the soldiers obey you?

447
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:45,949
Of course Maharaj! The soldiers must be obeying him...
they must be.

448
01:00:51,769 --> 01:00:54,260
Start the parades from tomorrow
-The parades

449
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:55,949
Yes
-Parade

450
01:00:56,139 --> 01:00:57,949
l will keep watch from my roof

451
01:00:58,349 --> 01:01:00,719
lf l see even a slight mistake, your...

452
01:01:39,889 --> 01:01:42,110
Fountain inside the room?

453
01:01:49,699 --> 01:01:51,840
What kind of a bird is this?

454
01:02:06,110 --> 01:02:06,869
Baghada

455
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:09,019
Yes

456
01:02:09,619 --> 01:02:11,320
The arrangements are good

457
01:02:11,820 --> 01:02:12,489
This will do

458
01:02:15,460 --> 01:02:18,010
Taste one
-Let me wash my hands and face

459
01:02:20,260 --> 01:02:22,400
Oh, for you also

460
01:02:31,969 --> 01:02:32,519
Hey

461
01:02:33,210 --> 01:02:34,639
Can you make a hookah for me?

462
01:02:34,980 --> 01:02:38,489
Go and make a hookah with some good tobacco

463
01:02:40,949 --> 01:02:42,650
You smoke?
-Yes

464
01:02:52,989 --> 01:02:56,360
Blessed by the King of Ghosts!
-Really nice boons he gave, right?

465
01:02:57,900 --> 01:03:01,909
Blessed by the King of Ghosts. Have the food.

466
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:05,909
Baghada,the King part is over... now what about the
princess?

467
01:03:06,579 --> 01:03:09,769
That will also take place. Why hurry?

468
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:14,960
Fan me faster

469
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:24,420
Baghada, do you think this King has got princesses?

470
01:03:24,929 --> 01:03:28,150
Even if there was, she would certainly not come out
and dance in front of us...

471
01:03:33,070 --> 01:03:34,619
We Salute you, King!

472
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:39,940
l'm really so happy to have met you...

473
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:42,239
...that l can't describe.

474
01:03:43,909 --> 01:03:47,949
You can speak, sir?
-You're not dumb?

475
01:03:54,519 --> 01:03:58,800
You thought l am mute as my subjects?

476
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:02,269
lt was not that

477
01:04:07,639 --> 01:04:13,030
Ten years earlier, I went fora long tour with my family.

478
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:22,699
ln my absence, my subjects lost their power of speech
due to an epidemic

479
01:04:26,659 --> 02:08:49,358
All my people

480
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:31,969
That's why this music contest?

481
01:04:32,730 --> 01:04:34,570
Your guess is perfect

482
01:04:36,699 --> 01:04:39,309
l'm very much a music lover.

483
01:04:40,199 --> 01:04:44,650
Without music, it's not possible for me to survive.

484
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:50,059
Your music has pleased me a lot.

485
01:04:50,750 --> 01:04:58,690
We're also very happy to hear that. In our villlages, the
Iocal King threwus out of the village because we sang.

486
01:05:00,420 --> 01:05:02,320
ls this possible?

487
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:07,050
Well, earlier we didn't sing so well. Then...

488
01:05:08,059 --> 01:05:12,420
...what happened was... it became expert. His voice and
my hands!

489
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:19,360
Whatever God does, He does it for our good.

490
01:05:20,679 --> 01:05:21,880
Your hookah

491
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:27,110
Oh no, l'm not addicted to tobacco

492
01:05:28,579 --> 01:05:31,920
New to the office jobs! Go, we don't need tobacco here.

493
01:05:39,829 --> 01:05:43,289
Listen, O great King...

494
01:05:44,230 --> 01:05:47,159
Shundi Raja, listen
O King, listen

495
01:05:47,670 --> 01:05:49,099
We're so happy

496
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:50,949
Really happy

497
01:05:51,869 --> 01:05:55,349
lndeed happy
-lndeed happy to come to your land

498
01:06:02,420 --> 01:06:04,559
This land is beyond comparison

499
01:06:05,090 --> 01:06:07,610
Beyond comparison
-This land is beyond comparison

500
01:06:08,159 --> 01:06:11,289
The soil bears gold here

501
01:06:12,090 --> 01:06:14,719
The soil bears gold here

502
01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:21,670
This land is so beautiful
Of unmatched splendor
Of countless qualities

503
01:06:22,539 --> 01:06:28,489
O King,we're indeed happy,
To come to such a land
To come to your land,
To come to Shundi

504
01:06:35,750 --> 01:06:38,820
The people here are speechless

505
01:06:39,820 --> 01:06:44,570
The people here are speechless, wordless

506
01:06:45,389 --> 01:06:51,719
Yet they come near,
Smile at you
And show their love

507
01:06:53,230 --> 01:06:55,010
The King of this land

508
01:06:55,800 --> 02:13:50,900
SaIute, Kingl.

509
01:06:57,269 --> 01:07:00,960
The king ofthis land,
No endto his grandeur!

510
01:07:01,809 --> 02:14:02,769
The king ofthis land,
No endto his grandeur!

511
01:07:06,409 --> 01:07:08,719
This King is a simple king
An honest king

512
01:07:09,219 --> 01:07:12,210
This king has given us home
-Given us home

513
01:07:12,650 --> 01:07:16,050
Has given all we want
-Has given

514
01:07:16,590 --> 01:07:18,869
ln such a land, O King...

515
01:07:19,230 --> 01:07:21,719
ln this land,we...
-The two of us...

516
01:07:22,130 --> 01:07:23,769
amidst all the comfort
-We're happy here

517
01:07:24,030 --> 02:14:48,069
ln your land,the land of Shundi

518
01:07:27,239 --> 01:07:27,409
ln your land,the land of Shundi

519
01:07:39,949 --> 01:07:42,880
l'm coming from Halla

520
01:07:43,519 --> 01:07:45,690
Wow! What news have you brought?

521
01:07:46,219 --> 01:07:49,619
Our King has sent you this

522
01:08:25,329 --> 01:08:29,460
Halla's King is my own brother. He was innocent as a
chid.

523
01:08:30,829 --> 01:08:33,140
Haven't got his news for a long time now

524
01:08:34,039 --> 01:08:37,029
Nowl see he is bent upon doing me harm

525
01:08:38,109 --> 01:08:43,060
lf l don't surrender within three days, he will come with
his troops and conquer my land.

526
01:08:44,909 --> 01:08:46,340
Can't we prevent this war?

527
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:49,600
ls it easy at all to prevent awar?

528
01:08:50,079 --> 01:08:51,449
lf we go there?

529
01:08:52,949 --> 01:08:54,850
Gowhere?
-To that Halla or whatever you said

530
01:09:00,060 --> 01:09:01,520
You make me laugh
-Why?

531
01:09:04,029 --> 01:09:05,899
Do you know Halla's distance?

532
01:09:06,529 --> 01:09:12,649
160 miles. l don't have horses or camels. Is it possible
to cover such a long distance on foot?

533
01:09:14,739 --> 01:09:17,579
We won't need horses or anyything like that.We have a...

534
01:09:18,579 --> 01:09:21,949
We'll walk. We're quite accustomed.

535
01:09:22,750 --> 01:09:23,920
Just walk on foot.

536
01:09:29,590 --> 01:09:30,960
Please let us go once.

537
01:09:31,289 --> 01:09:33,569
lf we are unable to do anyything, we will return.

538
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:35,899
No one knows us there

539
01:09:36,359 --> 01:09:37,789
So,why not?

540
01:09:41,670 --> 01:09:47,970
The way you are requesting, how can l not keep that?

541
01:09:49,710 --> 01:10:03,630
lf you're able to prevent this war,then I will marry one
of you to my only daughter.

542
01:10:05,789 --> 01:10:06,899
Daughter?

543
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:08,729
Princess?

544
01:10:10,529 --> 01:10:14,430
Monimala is the apple of my eye... my... my

545
01:10:16,369 --> 01:10:17,710
the beat of my heart

546
01:10:18,109 --> 01:10:19,600
lsn't she married yet?

547
01:10:20,270 --> 01:10:24,430
Worrying about her has made me quit eating and
sleeping.

548
01:10:25,350 --> 01:10:28,250
See you King; tomorrow early in the morning, we will
start for Halla

549
01:10:29,319 --> 01:10:33,680
Don't worry at all. We'll bring the King right in front of
you.

550
01:10:43,060 --> 01:10:46,520
We have only two days in hand. Everything has to be
done within this.

551
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:50,699
Yes, but where do we clap?

552
01:10:51,909 --> 01:10:54,689
Hush! Let's move on. Someone might see us

553
01:11:04,550 --> 01:11:05,479
Baghada

554
01:11:17,270 --> 01:11:18,409
Princess

555
01:11:19,100 --> 01:11:21,470
Are you sure?
-Monimala

556
01:11:25,010 --> 01:11:27,619
Not the maid?
-Shut up! Are maids supposed to be so fair?

557
01:11:29,310 --> 01:11:32,090
She looked
-Straight at me

558
01:11:35,350 --> 01:11:38,340
The bird flew away
-She must have seen you

559
01:11:39,319 --> 01:11:40,279
Let's go

560
01:11:41,359 --> 01:11:44,109
Camels...Arise

561
01:12:06,210 --> 01:12:08,380
What's all this?
-Parades, my Lord

562
01:12:09,449 --> 01:12:10,970
Your bloody head!

563
01:12:12,020 --> 01:12:14,359
This you call a parade! Nothing!

564
01:12:14,890 --> 01:12:19,520
You're planning a war with these skinny rascals! l'll
behead each one of them.

565
01:12:20,260 --> 01:12:23,770
Don't take a hasty decision, Emperor. Please give it a
though.

566
01:12:24,699 --> 02:24:48,469
lf what the spy said was wrong... if Shundi does have
troops.. if we are at all required to fight...

567
01:12:31,210 --> 01:12:33,260
lf this happens... if this... if that

568
01:12:33,609 --> 01:12:37,329
lf you fight, what will you fight with? Do you need these
heads?

569
01:12:38,210 --> 01:12:40,460
All the same if you have them or not

570
01:12:40,949 --> 01:12:42,000
Don't laugh

571
01:12:48,260 --> 01:12:50,479
Are you collecting the taxes or are they all due?
-Not at all

572
01:12:50,930 --> 01:12:52,890
Lie!
-No,why should l lie, great King?

573
01:12:53,329 --> 01:12:59,920
Those who are not paying taxes, l've asked all of them
to be brought to you.You just have to scold them a bit

574
01:13:00,939 --> 01:13:03,489
And all of them will pay up at the drop of a hat

575
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:25,130
Where are they taking them?

576
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:28,829
Hey uncle!

577
01:13:29,659 --> 01:13:31,619
What?
-Where are they taken?

578
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,960
To the King's palace
-Why?

579
01:13:34,270 --> 01:13:35,000
For trial

580
01:13:35,170 --> 01:13:36,689
Why?Are they robbers?

581
01:13:37,210 --> 02:27:13,899
No,they haven't paid the tax. So, they will be tried
-Why?

582
01:13:40,510 --> 01:13:41,359
Why haven't they paid the tax?

583
01:13:41,579 --> 01:13:44,270
Why pay taxesto a king who can not provide food to
all?

584
01:13:48,079 --> 01:13:48,810
Got it

585
01:13:50,350 --> 01:13:53,420
Shundi's King was right. Shall we see the palace?

586
01:13:53,989 --> 01:13:56,420
Not by clapping. Let's go by foot.

587
01:14:23,380 --> 01:14:24,079
Go

588
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:25,420
Go

589
01:14:37,829 --> 01:14:39,119
Stand here properly

590
01:14:45,439 --> 01:14:48,510
Sir,these are the rogues who haven't paid their taxes.

591
01:15:03,590 --> 01:15:04,960
Call the executioner

592
01:15:11,430 --> 01:15:13,619
Executioner?Why him?

593
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,869
lf you can't take orders how come you're a Minister?

594
01:15:17,569 --> 01:15:19,180
Executioner.

595
01:15:27,949 --> 01:15:29,939
Chop eveyone's heads off!

596
01:15:30,479 --> 01:15:35,930
First chop them to pieces. And then...

597
01:15:38,489 --> 01:15:40,130
Collecting taxes!

598
01:15:40,899 --> 01:15:42,100
Baghada

599
01:15:55,180 --> 02:31:37,280
HeyBagha, my friend

600
01:16:00,949 --> 01:16:03,409
Oh hey Goopy!

601
01:16:03,819 --> 01:16:08,180
Let's slip away
Hush-hush, my friend!

602
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:16,229
Let's run away, get away, slip away
Hush-hush my friend!

603
01:16:29,340 --> 02:32:45,569
Such weird ways...
LittIe is Ieft to know of them.

604
01:16:38,020 --> 01:16:40,210
My God! My God!

605
01:16:40,590 --> 01:16:47,829
Such weird ways...
LittIe is Ieft to know of them.

606
01:16:49,199 --> 01:16:51,069
My God! My God!

607
01:17:00,069 --> 01:17:05,260
The King of Halla and his shouts
Were enough to snatch our guts

608
01:17:11,289 --> 01:17:16,479
The King of Halla and his shouts
Were enough to snatch our guts

609
01:17:17,359 --> 01:17:19,699
Only the head is left now

610
01:17:20,130 --> 01:17:22,649
No head means no food to take

611
01:17:23,130 --> 01:17:25,500
Without the head
Living would be tough for sure

612
01:17:26,029 --> 01:17:28,310
Good God! Good God!

613
01:17:33,109 --> 01:17:37,890
Save yourself now, old boy!

614
01:17:38,649 --> 01:17:40,550
Run away, run away now!

615
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:46,880
No!

616
01:17:47,420 --> 01:17:50,460
Maharaj!
-No, no!

617
01:17:57,529 --> 01:17:59,050
No, no

618
01:18:08,439 --> 01:18:10,430
My little king!

619
01:18:11,609 --> 01:18:14,739
Come on... come now

620
01:18:16,180 --> 01:18:18,810
l sense something wrong here

621
01:18:19,750 --> 01:18:20,420
Why?

622
01:18:23,720 --> 01:18:26,529
When I was singing, l saw...

623
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:30,479
the King's eyes filled with tears

624
01:18:33,069 --> 01:18:35,029
Saw it in that King's eyes also

625
01:18:35,770 --> 01:18:41,130
When he was shouting, it seemed he was the Devil
incarnate

626
01:18:42,140 --> 01:18:46,500
and that fat man beside him...
-He is the Minister

627
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:49,890
Demon.

628
01:18:50,579 --> 01:18:51,720
Ravana

629
01:18:54,590 --> 01:18:56,810
lt's important to keep a watch on him.

630
01:18:57,420 --> 01:19:02,810
l've thought of it. We'll go right into his room. Let's see
what he is upto.

631
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,369
lf he sees us?
-We'll run away

632
01:19:07,100 --> 01:19:12,869
We're spies. If we don't know their plan,we can't
prevent thewar.

633
01:19:14,710 --> 01:19:16,819
You have time till tonight

634
01:19:17,510 --> 01:19:21,489
lf you get those two fellows by then, it's good.. or else
you'll be beheaded

635
01:19:22,220 --> 01:19:23,149
And if l do?

636
01:19:23,449 --> 01:19:25,760
What do you expect?
-No sir

637
01:19:26,989 --> 01:19:30,939
Want to taste meat?
-Didn't have for a long time

638
01:19:31,659 --> 01:19:36,020
Why do you always keep nosing for food?

639
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:39,930
The war is round the corner. Everyone is busy

640
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:45,539
And these two loafers... God knows where they came
from. Andyou are after food all the while

641
01:19:46,539 --> 01:19:49,199
First bring them to me. Then we'll think of food.

642
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:51,100
Get Iost.

643
01:19:57,420 --> 01:19:59,470
Come Barfi.. Sit down

644
01:20:25,109 --> 01:20:26,130
What's this?

645
01:20:29,979 --> 01:20:31,710
The medicine for the dumb?

646
01:20:32,149 --> 01:20:34,729
lf we apply this medicine, deaf mute people will talk?

647
01:20:35,189 --> 01:20:37,710
Make it clear to me in your language

648
01:20:38,359 --> 01:20:40,439
How do we apply it?

649
01:20:41,229 --> 01:20:43,039
You won't be there at Shundi

650
01:20:43,460 --> 01:20:45,329
l have to do everything

651
01:20:49,140 --> 01:20:50,449
Take a pinch of

652
01:20:54,739 --> 01:20:56,380
Drop it on the ground?

653
01:21:02,619 --> 01:21:04,609
Put it on fire

654
01:21:14,229 --> 01:21:15,430
There will be smoke all around

655
01:21:20,029 --> 01:21:21,930
Then everyone can talk, right?

656
01:21:24,239 --> 01:21:25,229
Listen Barfi

657
01:21:25,970 --> 01:21:26,729
Sit down

658
01:21:29,510 --> 01:21:31,210
l have something important to tell you

659
01:21:31,579 --> 01:21:33,449
Two young fellows have come here

660
01:21:34,350 --> 01:21:36,279
Their songs are reviving the King to his normal state

661
01:21:37,079 --> 01:21:40,479
Make such a strong drug that he remains forever under
its influence.

662
01:21:44,930 --> 01:21:46,979
Where are those fellows right now?

663
01:21:48,760 --> 01:21:50,369
Where are the two now?

664
01:21:52,399 --> 01:21:53,630
ln the norrth?

665
01:21:55,369 --> 01:21:56,510
ln Halla?

666
01:21:58,310 --> 01:21:59,619
This side of the river?

667
01:22:01,710 --> 01:22:04,729
What? Roaming around the fort?

668
01:22:08,319 --> 01:22:09,170
What?

669
01:22:09,550 --> 01:22:10,689
lnside this room?

670
01:22:20,789 --> 01:22:21,340
Freeze!

And you remain there!

Mr. Minister
The Great Dictator

Mr. Minister
The Great Dictator

01:22:39,510 --> 01:22:42,789
Your tricks and turns
We know them all

677
01:22:45,619 --> 01:22:48,899
Your tricks and turns
We know them all

678
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:55,300
Out in the open they are,
All those cunning tricks

679
01:22:56,029 --> 01:22:56,729
Open Sesame

680
01:22:56,960 --> 01:22:57,630
Freeze there

681
01:22:58,270 --> 01:23:01,170
Mr. Minister
The Great Dictator

01:23:09,510 --> 01:23:12,550
You've seen the bird, and not the trapl.
Frown you so much on seeing that

683
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:18,560
You've seen the bird, and not the trap.
Frown you so much on seeing that

684
01:23:20,390 --> 01:23:22,970
Once you set foot in the trap,
You're all dried up!

685
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:25,689
Once you set foot in the trap,
You're all dried up!

686
01:23:25,989 --> 01:23:26,859
Bang on!

687
01:23:27,189 --> 01:23:29,619
O Great Minister
Freeze for good!

688
01:23:33,170 --> 01:23:38,529
O Great Minister
Remain in alert!

689
01:24:29,260 --> 01:24:33,649
lf we can drop the Minister on this thorn bushes!

690
01:24:55,380 --> 01:24:57,899
Baghada,what shall we do now?

691
01:24:58,720 --> 01:24:59,829
Think hard

692
01:25:07,289 --> 01:25:10,689
Today and tomorrow... only two days

693
01:25:11,630 --> 01:25:13,470
Day after tomorrow the troops will start marching

694
01:25:14,770 --> 01:25:18,250
Whatever there is to do,we have to do them by this
time, understood?
-Yes l know

695
01:25:22,010 --> 01:25:26,229
Know what Baghada,we are not cut out for this
princess and stuff

696
01:25:27,779 --> 01:25:30,270
The three boons were enough for us

697
01:25:30,720 --> 01:25:34,409
Speaking only nonsense! Can't you say something
useful? Only thinking of the Princess!

698
01:25:35,060 --> 01:25:38,779
After that heavy meal,the brain isn't working.

699
01:25:39,659 --> 01:25:42,970
Baghada,where can we get some good ghee?

700
01:25:44,460 --> 01:25:49,260
Simple! Made from the cream of the milk of a cow's
ghost!

701
01:25:52,569 --> 01:25:55,470
Do ghosts eat such stuff?
-They might as well

702
01:25:56,210 --> 01:25:58,640
No death, no diseases.

703
01:25:59,079 --> 01:26:01,890
Could go on without eating as well. Ghosts after all!

704
01:26:46,930 --> 01:26:48,270
O Barfi!

705
01:26:52,029 --> 01:26:53,170
Oh my God!

706
01:26:59,340 --> 01:27:00,539
Barfi

707
01:27:06,109 --> 01:27:08,449
Good reasons why l avoid coming here!

708
01:27:09,420 --> 01:27:11,229
How much longer will you take?

709
01:27:13,750 --> 01:27:16,590
l can't sleep at night due to anxiety

710
01:27:19,630 --> 01:27:23,409
Oh yes l'm having patience. But the only cause ofwory
is...

711
01:27:24,229 --> 01:27:27,859
... if the drug doesn't act at the right moment, we will be
ruined

712
01:27:28,470 --> 01:27:31,130
lt works only till the time he sits on the throne.

713
01:27:31,670 --> 01:27:34,689
Or else, eveyone in this country will be beheaded... me
for certain

714
01:27:35,409 --> 01:27:36,720
Even you

715
01:27:39,550 --> 01:27:41,329
Don't joke with me Barfi

716
01:27:42,579 --> 02:55:23,908
lt's not a time to joke about

717
01:27:44,750 --> 01:27:45,979
There is much work to do

718
01:27:46,720 --> 01:27:48,590
We have to suppress the King

719
01:27:49,720 --> 01:27:52,300
We also have to punish those two imps

720
01:27:53,859 --> 01:27:58,199
What l understand is they are no less than you in
wizardry.

721
01:28:06,670 --> 01:28:08,810
Oh why are you getting fired up, Barfi?

722
01:28:10,109 --> 01:28:12,829
l didn't mean that. They are like dust when compared to
you

723
01:28:58,729 --> 01:29:00,810
Leave us!
-What's all this?

724
01:29:33,390 --> 01:29:36,899
Birds chirp
As Daybreak embarks

725
01:29:37,960 --> 01:29:41,210
Time for you to sit on the throne, dear!

726
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:42,789
Why?

727
01:29:43,340 --> 01:29:47,729
lf you just keep on playing like that, people will say bad
things. Will it be good for us?

728
01:29:48,779 --> 01:29:51,119
Especially since the war starts tomorrow!

729
01:29:52,380 --> 01:29:53,140
War?

730
01:29:54,079 --> 01:29:56,510
A great war!

731
01:29:56,979 --> 01:29:58,850
Or else how will your empire expand?

732
01:29:59,649 --> 01:30:02,050
The weapons will be rusted

733
01:30:02,819 --> 01:30:04,369
But who will fight?

734
01:30:04,789 --> 01:30:06,930
Poor dear! Again uttering childish gibberish!

735
01:30:08,399 --> 01:30:11,119
Just fight for these two days, and then you'll be free

736
01:30:16,300 --> 01:30:17,640
Free?

737
01:30:18,239 --> 01:30:23,539
Your vacation starts! Now open your mouth. You have
to take this medicine,you know. Open wide... here we
go!

738
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:25,840
Have it..yeah..yeah

739
01:30:46,300 --> 01:30:48,000
War!

740
01:31:15,100 --> 01:31:16,829
Shall we clap once and see?

741
01:31:20,199 --> 01:31:22,810
lf one pair of shoes can take us even halfway...

742
01:31:32,510 --> 01:31:33,239
Shundi

743
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:48,260
Shall l sing once, Baghada?

744
01:31:49,300 --> 01:31:51,579
What's the use? Nothing

745
01:31:52,029 --> 01:31:54,109
The key is outside the prison. Look there

746
01:31:58,140 --> 01:31:59,310
There it is

747
01:31:59,569 --> 01:32:03,170
That's the key. Tied to his waist. Have you seen?

748
01:32:03,939 --> 01:32:04,430
And...

749
01:32:05,210 --> 01:32:06,989
... here is the lock

750
01:32:10,180 --> 01:32:11,930
Now do what you can think of

751
01:32:14,850 --> 01:32:17,600
Shundi! Shundi! Shundi!

752
01:32:22,300 --> 01:32:23,970
March to Shundi!

753
01:32:30,939 --> 01:32:32,369
Why aren't they going?

754
01:32:38,579 --> 01:32:40,449
Why are they laughing?

755
01:32:45,350 --> 01:32:47,979
Well, they are not soldiers, Emperor
-Then what?

756
01:32:48,420 --> 01:32:50,119
The remains of your ancestors?

757
01:32:51,119 --> 01:32:54,250
They have come to meet you.Today is tuesday

758
01:33:02,439 --> 01:33:05,069
Maharaja, they have come from across the seas.

759
01:33:26,489 --> 01:33:28,100
Call the executioner
-The executioner?

760
01:33:28,699 --> 01:33:29,399
The executioner?

761
01:33:32,300 --> 01:33:33,819
Why? Is there no such thing as an Executioner?

762
01:33:34,100 --> 01:33:34,890
Executionerl.

763
01:33:35,100 --> 01:33:36,909
Executioner is there, but...

764
01:33:41,369 --> 01:33:42,569
Shall l sing now?

765
01:33:42,979 --> 03:07:25,548
You will sing now?
-Oh yes I will sing now

766
01:33:46,250 --> 01:33:47,920
The King will sing now

767
01:33:48,310 --> 01:33:50,859
You shall sing with me
You shall

768
01:33:51,319 --> 01:33:56,890
Whoever doesn't...when l say,you start...whoever
doesn't will be beheaded.

769
01:33:58,760 --> 01:33:59,659
Musiçians!

770
01:34:00,489 --> 01:34:02,069
What drug did you make, Barfi?

771
01:34:03,529 --> 01:34:06,750
Please let us go. Is it rightful to imprison poor people
like us?

772
01:34:09,270 --> 01:34:11,439
Really... don't you have even a little bit of mercy?

773
01:34:11,939 --> 01:34:13,609
Can't you see from our condition?

774
01:34:14,069 --> 01:34:16,239
Tragedy... one after another... inflicting pains on our
torrtured souls!

775
01:34:16,880 --> 01:34:18,930
The way Fate derides us!

776
01:34:20,180 --> 01:34:24,569
Dhol, shoes... all gone... and now is it the Princess?

777
01:34:27,119 --> 01:34:31,920
What a Fate! What Destiny!

778
01:34:37,159 --> 01:34:39,439
Beast!. Ghost!. Bird!

779
01:34:40,029 --> 01:34:42,989
Devil! Crow! Cow! Pig! Mole!

780
01:34:49,640 --> 01:34:52,010
He will get us beheaded

781
01:34:53,079 --> 01:34:54,369
Behead?

782
01:35:07,159 --> 01:35:10,229
Princes and nobles
All that are present

783
01:35:11,829 --> 01:35:14,850
Why can't you sing?
Halla is going to war

784
01:35:15,300 --> 01:35:18,489
Sing!
Halla is going to war!

785
01:35:19,039 --> 01:35:22,229
Halla is going to war!

786
01:35:22,779 --> 03:10:45,008
Halla! Halla! Halla! Halla! Halla! Halla! Halla! Halla!

787
01:35:34,489 --> 03:10:56,718
Shundi will be blown away!

788
01:35:37,760 --> 03:10:59,989
Blow Shundi away, you must!

789
01:35:40,859 --> 01:35:42,909
Reducethem to a blob of flesh!

790
01:35:43,229 --> 01:35:45,750
Reduce them to ablob of flesh,you must.

791
01:35:46,300 --> 01:35:51,430
Nowhere to escape, no one
-Nowhere to escape, not even me

792
01:35:52,210 --> 01:35:56,899
Halla is going towar!
-Oh yes! Halla is going to war!

793
01:35:58,039 --> 01:36:02,960
To the war!. To the war!. To the war! To the war!.

794
01:36:10,520 --> 01:36:11,829
Are you hungry?

795
01:36:13,329 --> 01:36:16,960
Of course. l haven't had anything since last evening.

796
01:36:20,670 --> 01:36:23,569
Uncle, don't you give your prisoners anything to eat?

797
01:36:26,510 --> 01:36:28,819
Turn around,we will just take our meal

798
01:36:31,109 --> 01:36:35,859
Let us first starve to death. Then they will feed us

799
01:36:36,720 --> 01:36:38,449
What a devil!

800
01:36:50,399 --> 01:36:51,510
Barfi

801
01:36:59,039 --> 01:37:00,149
Barfi

802
01:37:04,739 --> 01:37:10,600
There lived a king
-Good! Sing like this, don't scream

803
01:37:13,789 --> 01:37:19,970
There lived a king
Whose sorrows knew no bounds

804
01:37:20,890 --> 01:37:26,630
Weeps the poor king
Whose sorrows knew no bounds

805
01:37:27,699 --> 01:37:30,329
Great! Nice composition!

806
01:37:33,140 --> 01:37:39,970
Where does sorrow come from?
-Do you know where from?

807
01:37:40,979 --> 01:37:45,369
lt's not that
Only the poor suffer from it

808
01:37:46,149 --> 01:37:55,500
Whose house is stuffed with gold
Suffers he too from fear

809
01:37:56,859 --> 01:37:58,029
He is more afraid

810
01:37:58,460 --> 01:38:02,850
He too is not happy

811
01:38:03,640 --> 01:38:05,810
Loses his sleep for fear of dacoits!

812
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:13,000
Will this sorrow ever go?

813
01:38:13,909 --> 01:38:18,300
What the King thinks
With such a glum face?

814
01:38:19,649 --> 01:38:28,060
Will the King be relieved by
Punishing everyone?

815
01:38:29,430 --> 01:38:32,039
Will this sorrow ever go?

816
01:38:32,630 --> 01:38:35,180
lf the King heard this, he would have let us go

817
01:38:37,439 --> 01:38:43,239
How does this sorrow go?

818
01:38:45,180 --> 01:38:51,039
Being a prisoner in one's own palace
Is quite a trouble

819
01:38:52,319 --> 01:39:01,050
Ask the King to forsake his throne
And roam about in the field instead

820
01:39:03,060 --> 01:39:10,300
Ask the King to forsake his throne
And roam about in the field instead

821
01:39:11,399 --> 01:39:18,460
Peace will reign in his life
Peace,for sure

822
01:39:29,720 --> 01:39:31,029
Freedom!

823
01:39:32,930 --> 01:39:33,890
My...

824
01:39:35,600 --> 01:39:37,060
My freedom won't come?

825
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:42,430
Sure, King dear. Just fight for one more day, and you'll
be granted freedom.

826
01:39:45,939 --> 01:39:50,890
Get up, little one! Get up! My sweet King!

827
01:40:04,920 --> 01:40:06,500
Who will eat these?

828
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:09,239
Do you have pet rats here?

829
01:40:23,640 --> 01:40:26,300
l'll teach them a lesson

830
01:40:56,239 --> 01:40:58,109
Are you comfortable, sirs?

831
01:41:02,619 --> 01:41:05,170
So much sympathy you have for the King!

832
01:41:05,819 --> 01:41:06,930
Shut up!

833
01:41:07,350 --> 01:41:09,020
Too much sympathy, is it?

834
01:41:14,630 --> 01:41:17,729
Where will this song come from if l chop your head?

835
01:41:21,069 --> 01:41:23,729
You've been given food. Why didn't you eat?

836
01:41:24,800 --> 01:41:26,170
We're not hungy, Sir

837
01:41:26,470 --> 01:41:28,930
Or is it that you don't like the food?

838
01:41:29,409 --> 01:41:30,640
Not hungry

839
01:41:31,880 --> 01:41:33,399
Oh! Is that so?

840
01:41:34,409 --> 01:41:37,510
Poor dear! But you have to eat this food only.

841
01:41:38,680 --> 01:41:39,199
Why?

842
01:41:39,449 --> 01:41:40,380
Of coursel.

843
01:41:41,050 --> 01:41:41,779
Come

844
01:41:43,119 --> 01:41:43,909
Come

845
01:41:45,689 --> 01:41:49,029
The whole kingdom is feeding on this, and... here
come the two Nawabs!

846
01:41:51,029 --> 01:41:52,140
Pick it up

847
01:41:52,529 --> 01:41:53,699
Come on, pick it up

848
01:41:58,939 --> 01:41:59,810
Sit down

849
01:42:00,970 --> 01:42:02,229
Go, sit down

850
01:42:12,649 --> 01:42:13,670
Have it

851
01:42:14,289 --> 01:42:16,039
Water...to wash my hands...
-What?

852
01:42:16,819 --> 01:42:17,840
Nothing

853
01:42:27,329 --> 01:42:28,439
Remember

854
01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:30,470
You are spared this time

855
01:42:34,109 --> 01:42:39,300
ln the future, if you sing without my permission,that
will be your last song, got it?

856
01:42:46,520 --> 01:42:48,189
''There is still time; shall l send my messenger?''

857
01:42:55,289 --> 01:42:57,779
The two of them went...

858
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,810
But, l can't let go of hope.

859
01:43:43,840 --> 01:43:45,710
Look at him!

860
01:44:20,779 --> 01:44:21,680
What?

861
01:44:22,050 --> 01:44:22,949
Were you hurt?

862
01:44:25,819 --> 01:44:27,750
You're asking what are all this?

863
01:44:28,520 --> 01:44:30,270
This is meat

864
01:44:31,819 --> 01:44:33,600
This is rohu fish

865
01:44:35,390 --> 01:44:37,090
This is the hilsa

866
01:44:39,529 --> 01:44:40,550
Prawns!

867
01:44:41,470 --> 01:44:43,930
This is ''vegatable stuffed with fish''

868
01:44:44,670 --> 01:44:45,930
You want to have?

869
01:44:46,409 --> 01:44:47,489
You can't digest

870
01:44:48,109 --> 01:44:49,399
You are not used to

871
01:44:51,739 --> 01:44:53,409
Okay, come inside. Open the lock,the lock

872
01:44:54,750 --> 01:44:56,010
Come inside, come

873
01:44:56,649 --> 01:44:58,109
There is still a lot left for you.

874
01:45:09,430 --> 01:45:13,500
Eat well, okay? We're leaving then.

875
01:45:45,699 --> 01:45:47,630
CameIs, marçhl.

876
01:45:57,979 --> 01:45:59,409
Camels, march

877
01:46:09,859 --> 01:46:11,729
Halla goes to war

878
01:46:12,090 --> 01:46:14,899
We're in deep trouble, Sir. The soldiers are not
listening to me.

879
01:46:15,560 --> 01:46:17,489
Not listening?
-They aren't obeying my orders

880
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,250
No one is even standing up. All squatted on the ground.

881
01:46:20,699 --> 01:46:21,869
Good God!

882
01:46:22,430 --> 01:46:23,949
This was the thing I feared

883
01:46:24,939 --> 01:46:27,279
Shall I tell you one thing, Sir?
-What?

884
01:46:28,310 --> 01:46:30,239
ls it at all necessary to send troops?
-What?

885
01:46:31,140 --> 01:46:36,239
l mean... is the war at all necessary?
-Good God! Good God! Good God! Good God!

886
01:46:38,550 --> 01:46:42,829
General, did you lose your mind as a result of my
overfeeding you?

887
01:46:43,590 --> 01:46:48,220
We're going to conquer a kingdom. If troops don't go,
who will? You, me and King?

888
01:46:49,029 --> 01:46:54,449
And Shundi folks will welcome us and say, ''Minister,
please take our county.''

889
01:46:56,970 --> 01:46:58,340
Barfi... Barfi

890
01:46:58,869 --> 01:47:02,649
You are my last ray of hope. Please save us by some
Iast trick

891
01:47:03,279 --> 01:47:09,289
Our soldiers are not willing to go. Please make them
march at any cost.

892
01:47:12,350 --> 01:47:18,000
Please Barfi, please. Or else everything including my
prestige, Shundi..will be lost!

893
01:47:40,779 --> 01:47:45,760
Shundi wiII be reduced to ashes!

894
01:47:47,189 --> 01:47:49,329
General,you may leave. Barfi will come later.

895
01:47:49,989 --> 01:47:53,239
Barfi,the King's drug?

896
01:48:00,369 --> 03:35:53,608
Let's go to Shundi, King!

897
01:48:03,399 --> 01:48:07,590
No
-Why? But yesterday you were talking about going to
Shundi... conquering them...

898
01:48:08,840 --> 01:48:10,920
You'll reduce Shundi to ashes, you said.
-No no!

899
01:48:15,149 --> 01:48:16,439
ln Shundi

900
01:48:18,819 --> 01:48:20,569
My brother lives in Shundi

901
01:48:21,649 --> 01:48:22,989
l remember now

902
01:48:25,619 --> 01:48:28,609
A dacoit...

903
01:48:35,899 --> 01:48:37,239
l won't go to the war
-Barfi

904
01:48:37,470 --> 01:48:41,100
l won't  go to the war. I won't take this drug.
-Barfi

905
01:48:47,609 --> 01:48:48,310
ls he dead?

906
01:48:51,319 --> 01:48:56,859
Senseless for three days? Okay,we can finish our work
by then.

907
01:48:57,689 --> 01:49:00,350
Barfi, do your last major task

908
01:49:09,470 --> 01:49:13,600
Your time is up

909
01:50:09,399 --> 01:50:11,300
March to Shundi!

910
01:50:35,149 --> 01:50:37,729
It's therel.

911
01:50:39,630 --> 01:50:41,409
Here take yours!

912
01:50:56,140 --> 01:51:01,300
Watch out with your eyes open
The marching troops of thousands

913
01:51:02,149 --> 01:51:05,989
Watch out with your eyes open
The marching troops of thousands

914
01:51:06,649 --> 01:51:11,689
Hordes and hordes of soldiers
Slashing and smashing of weapons

915
01:51:12,520 --> 01:51:17,710
Slashing and smashing with their weapons

916
01:51:18,500 --> 01:51:21,250
Poor foIksl. Pityl.

917
01:51:23,140 --> 01:51:25,659
Pain one forgets
If gain one gets

918
01:51:28,710 --> 01:51:31,229
Pain one forgets
If gain one gets

919
01:51:31,739 --> 01:51:35,689
Soldiers scare us really

920
01:51:36,350 --> 01:51:41,449
Starved to near death
Near death it is

921
01:51:42,319 --> 01:51:47,590
And yet, each one goes to the war
And yet, each one goes to the war

922
01:52:00,739 --> 01:52:05,130
O you Halla's troops!

923
01:52:05,880 --> 01:52:10,270
O you Halla's troops!

924
01:52:11,479 --> 01:52:15,869
What will you gain from this war
We want to know

925
01:52:20,989 --> 01:52:25,380
What will you gain from this war
We want to know

926
01:52:30,670 --> 01:52:36,380
Why lose  your lives
Holding these petty weapons?

927
01:52:42,979 --> 01:52:47,989
Why lose your lives
Holding these petty weapons?

928
01:52:49,020 --> 01:52:58,930
Ominous it is
The war between countries

929
01:53:00,399 --> 01:53:04,789
What will you gain from this war
We want to know

930
01:53:16,649 --> 01:53:22,329
The King shouts and scowls
And the Minister follows suit

931
01:53:28,989 --> 01:53:34,260
The King shouts and scowls
And the Minister follows suit

932
01:53:35,229 --> 01:53:45,250
With people like bunch of bananas
The whole country is a mess

933
01:53:46,750 --> 01:53:51,140
What will you gain from this war
We want to know

934
01:53:56,050 --> 01:54:03,199
Come... Come from the sky
Boxes and boxes of sweets

935
01:54:04,229 --> 01:54:11,970
Sweets of every kind,
The best of the best of sweets
Rain sweets from the heaven
Sweets of every kind!

936
01:54:47,840 --> 01:54:48,800
Freedom!

937
01:54:50,210 --> 01:54:51,289
HeyGeneral!

938
01:54:51,880 --> 01:54:53,869
Freedom!. Freedom!

939
01:54:54,649 --> 01:54:58,779
Freedom!. Freedom!

940
01:55:53,710 --> 01:55:54,439
Shundi

941
01:56:00,279 --> 01:56:02,329
We've brought him, the King of Halla

942
01:56:18,399 --> 01:56:21,090
Oh brother,you haven't changed!

943
01:56:21,770 --> 01:56:27,069
That dacoit made me the king, got me drugged by a
magician, and made me do all sorts of things

944
01:56:28,869 --> 01:56:31,060
Like announcing war against Shundi?

945
01:56:31,939 --> 01:56:33,869
That's a terrible story!

946
01:56:35,850 --> 01:56:39,130
l could not even think of gettingyou back.

947
01:56:39,680 --> 01:56:41,380
Did l also...

948
01:56:41,649 --> 01:56:44,369
think that I would ever be free?

949
01:56:56,229 --> 01:56:57,750
How many years has it been?

950
01:56:58,199 --> 01:57:00,810
Almost twenty years

951
01:57:02,310 --> 01:57:05,350
Can you ever think, I was coming to conquer your land?

952
01:57:05,880 --> 01:57:08,689
My kingdom? It's also your kingdom.

953
01:57:15,119 --> 01:57:17,960
Can we fixthe deal about the princess?

954
01:57:18,920 --> 01:57:20,380
You said...
-Princess

955
01:57:24,300 --> 01:57:27,489
l had almost forgotten about you

956
01:57:28,699 --> 01:57:33,479
Anyone here? Please bring Monimala

957
01:57:36,539 --> 01:57:40,079
So Gopinath,you're giving consent, right?

958
01:57:41,880 --> 01:57:43,840
What? Gopinath?

959
01:57:44,750 --> 01:57:47,300
Yes, l had thought of him only

960
01:57:48,119 --> 01:57:49,079
Him?

961
01:57:50,220 --> 01:57:52,239
My daughter is tall, so...

962
01:57:52,689 --> 01:57:58,760
What are you saying Sir? Gopinath hasn't even thought
of this. It was mewho had this idea. This is a long
cherished wish of mine.

963
01:57:59,760 --> 01:58:03,189
You can't understand. l have only one daughter.

964
01:58:03,800 --> 01:58:06,430
Fair enough! Give he to me.Am l any lessthan him?

965
01:58:07,710 --> 01:58:09,109
This much Iess.

966
01:58:09,670 --> 01:58:11,100
How dare you?

967
01:58:11,340 --> 01:58:13,149
Are you short of princesses?

968
01:58:14,310 --> 01:58:16,180
Princess? Is there any dearth?

969
01:58:16,680 --> 01:58:18,760
l have Monimala only

970
01:58:19,319 --> 01:58:21,399
And l have Muktamala

971
01:58:23,189 --> 01:58:25,359
Yes, my only daughter.

972
01:58:25,859 --> 01:58:27,350
Where is she?
-Halla

973
01:58:29,859 --> 01:58:30,760
Let's go Gopinath

974
01:58:48,109 --> 01:58:49,859
Whose voice is it?

975
01:58:54,119 --> 01:58:55,199
What's this?

976
01:58:59,159 --> 01:59:00,970
My own people's voices!

977
01:59:01,630 --> 01:59:03,850
How happy l am!
How happy indeed!

978
01:59:04,659 --> 01:59:06,800
How happy l am!

979
01:59:07,729 --> 01:59:08,600
Moni

980
01:59:09,369 --> 01:59:12,710
Moni dear! Today is a day to rejoice. My people are...

981
01:59:16,010 --> 01:59:16,739
Mukta

982
01:59:19,739 --> 01:59:22,289
Please go dear. Your uncle

983
01:59:23,380 --> 01:59:24,720
Take his blessings

984
01:59:37,300 --> 01:59:39,760
Be a queen, dear

985
01:59:45,439 --> 01:59:48,510
Do you like your brides?

986
01:59:53,579 --> 01:59:56,479
We couldn't see her face

987
01:59:57,520 --> 02:00:01,970
We have to see properly before we can choose. How is
it possible if the faces are veiled?

988
02:00:04,359 --> 02:00:06,109
Please open your veil, dear

989
02:00:06,689 --> 02:00:09,439
Open a bit.. oh they are shying away

990
02:00:14,670 --> 02:00:16,039
Very shy indeed

991
02:00:16,699 --> 02:00:18,069
Very shy

992
02:00:33,850 --> 02:00:34,930
Royal dresses

993
02:01:11,520 --> 02:01:12,600
Alright

994
02:01:12,859 --> 02:01:13,760
Excellent

995
02:01:17,729 --> 02:01:20,630
We are very pleased
-So, let us fix the date

996
02:01:21,270 --> 02:01:22,850
The sooner, the better
