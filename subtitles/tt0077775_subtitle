1
00:01:56,515 --> 00:01:59,846
Then the Gods said that, truly,

2
00:01:59,847 --> 00:02:03,284
this Demon can't be fought with.

3
00:02:04,023 --> 00:02:06,014
Brahma had given him
such a boon that...

4
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:08,083
...no God was able to defeat him.

5
00:02:10,129 --> 00:02:13,963
Then Vishnu... Then Vishnu
flew into a rage.

6
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:18,970
An aura emerged from his face,
an aura emerged from...

7
00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:21,302
...the face of Shiva as well.
And auras emerged...

8
00:02:21,373 --> 00:02:23,364
...from the faces of
the various Gods.

9
00:02:23,442 --> 00:02:28,971
All those auras converged
together and created this...

10
00:02:29,048 --> 00:02:32,984
...Goddess, Durga! This
Durga has 10 hands.

11
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:36,978
And with 10 kinds of weapons
in the 10 hands...

12
00:02:37,056 --> 00:02:40,492
...astride a vehicle...
- What's her vehicle?

13
00:02:40,559 --> 00:02:44,325
Vehicle? Her vehicle is a lion.

14
00:02:45,064 --> 00:02:50,001
Durga's vehicle is a lion,
Ganesha's, a mouse.

15
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:56,002
Karthik's, a peacock.
Lakshmi's, an owl.

16
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:59,338
And Saraswati's vehicle is a swan.

17
00:03:00,112 --> 00:03:04,947
The Goddess fought with
Mahishasura, on this lion.

18
00:03:05,017 --> 00:03:08,453
Is this all true?
- How do I falsify it, dear?

19
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:11,285
The sages have written about it.

20
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:15,950
Everything is true.
Mahishasura is true...

21
00:03:16,028 --> 00:03:20,527
...Hanuman is true, Digpal is true,

22
00:03:20,528 --> 00:03:23,098
Varunadev is true...

23
00:03:56,335 --> 00:04:00,431
Uncle Bikash! 
The dacoits have come.

24
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:24,953
Is Ghoshal there?
- Who? - Umanath Ghoshal?
- Is he there? - Yes.

25
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:28,295
Tell him that Maganlal Meghraj
has come to meet him.

26
00:04:29,034 --> 00:04:31,969
Rukku,
go and tell father.

27
00:04:39,311 --> 00:04:41,973
Your introduction?
- I'm Bikas Singh.

28
00:04:42,481 --> 00:04:45,973
Are you related to him?
- No. I stay in this house.

29
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:20,008
What's the matter?

30
00:05:20,085 --> 00:05:23,282
You've come suddenly
after so many years?

31
00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:29,955
Sit.

32
00:05:30,462 --> 00:05:32,953
How many days has it
been since we met?

33
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:35,967
I had passed out in 1950.
And you, in '51.

34
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:38,026
You'd failed one year.

35
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:41,296
Tell me, what's the matter?

36
00:05:41,373 --> 00:05:43,967
I had last seen you at the temple...

37
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:46,978
...so I thought, why not
come and meet you?

38
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:49,480
We come here every
year for the Pujas.

39
00:05:49,548 --> 00:05:54,986
Father is here, Grandpa is here...
- And your Ganesh? - Ganesh?

40
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:01,412
You still remember that!?

41
00:06:01,413 --> 00:06:04,918
- It's there? 
- Why won't it be?

42
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:08,933
It has almost become a part
of our family .

43
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:13,267
Will you show it to me?
- It's kept in father's trunk.

44
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:16,941
And the key of that trunk
is in father's drawer.

45
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:19,000
Doesn't your father
show it to anyone?

46
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:22,270
Showing it to anyone and showing...

47
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:24,339
...it to you, aren't the same thing.

48
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:26,407
You're not very popular in the market.

49
00:06:26,485 --> 00:06:28,953
You tend to get defamed
if you have money.

50
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:33,287
You earn money like me, you,
too, will get defamed.

51
00:06:35,294 --> 00:06:39,287
But you also have to see
how you earn that money.

52
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:43,024
I heard that you're
selling off the...

53
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:45,297
...treasures of the country
to the foreigners.

54
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:48,465
And the Americans are giving
you fat money for that.

55
00:06:49,141 --> 00:06:52,536
I'm offering you Rs. 20000,

56
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:56,309
I've brought it along with me.

57
00:06:57,049 --> 00:07:00,917
What?
- You haven't even seen that thing yet.

58
00:07:00,986 --> 00:07:03,921
Without seeing it, you're
offering such a high price!

59
00:07:05,257 --> 00:07:10,923
Gold figure, a diamond
in the crown...

60
00:07:11,263 --> 00:07:13,925
...rubies and emeralds at the base...

61
00:07:13,999 --> 00:07:17,935
...it's of Nepali origin.
- How did you know so much about it?

62
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:20,261
I haven't told you anything.

63
00:07:36,021 --> 00:07:38,012
This has been written by Father.

64
00:07:39,024 --> 00:07:41,015
I haven't seen it in my life.

65
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:44,529
Rs. 25000, cash.

66
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:47,965
I know about your business.

67
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:51,292
I also know how much money
you owe in the market.

68
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:55,029
If I have to sell that
Ganesha to you...

69
00:07:55,107 --> 00:07:57,098
...then I've to learn
the art of stealing.

70
00:07:59,311 --> 00:08:01,245
The question of selling
it doesn't arise.

71
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:07,247
Rs. 30000. I don't ask for
things from everyone.

72
00:08:08,253 --> 00:08:13,418
If needed, I just snatch it.
It saves my money, too.

73
00:08:16,261 --> 00:08:18,923
I'm openly transacting with you.

74
00:08:20,265 --> 00:08:23,919
No, brother. Sorry.

75
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:29,112
Is this your final verdict?

76
00:08:29,113 --> 00:08:30,266
Yes.

77
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:07,128
Who is it?

78
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:48,006
It's better if you keep your hands on your head,
else it'll ache.

79
00:10:48,513 --> 00:10:51,346
Do you know how many temples
are there in Kashi? - How many?

80
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:58,023
How many temples are there in Kashi?
- 33 crores.

81
00:11:01,026 --> 00:11:03,017
Just sign here.

82
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:10,291
Are there attached bathrooms
in your lodge ? - Yes.

83
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:13,304
Look, I'm very particular
about this.

84
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:15,363
Yes.
- Every room in our lodge...

85
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:21,973
Are you Mr. Chakraborty?
- Yes.

86
00:11:22,314 --> 00:11:26,978
I'm Lalmohan Ganguly.
- Welcome!

87
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:31,483
This is Pradosh Mitra.
- Ok. - And this is Tapeshranjan.

88
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:35,987
My assistant had given me a detailed
introduction about you.

89
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:40,992
Do we have to sign?
- It's just a negligible formality.

90
00:11:42,067 --> 00:11:44,058
You're the eldest, you do it.

91
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:46,994
You just write your
names and sign here.

92
00:11:47,072 --> 00:11:49,063
I'll take care of the rest.

93
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:52,008
Your assistant is related to me.

94
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:55,336
That's why I thought of asking him
if he could book a room for us here...

95
00:11:57,349 --> 00:11:59,340
You're the one with the
synonym Jatadhar...

96
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:03,010
Not 'Dhar', but 'Yu'.
- Jatayu.

97
00:12:05,457 --> 00:12:08,949
I've released a new novel this puja,
'Karal Kumbhir'.

98
00:12:10,462 --> 00:12:12,453
O really!? Send the
luggage to room no. 3.

99
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,291
I'm giving you a 4-bedded room.

100
00:12:23,308 --> 00:12:25,970
Please sit for a while,
I'll be back. - Ok.

101
00:12:31,316 --> 00:12:33,978
What arrangements do you
have for water? - What?

102
00:12:36,054 --> 00:12:38,045
You'll get a running servant.

103
00:12:38,123 --> 00:12:40,114
He will give hot water to
you whenever you want it.

104
00:12:44,329 --> 00:12:46,991
Wow! Quite good.
- It's good, even...

105
00:12:47,065 --> 00:12:50,501
...though it is not like the Jodhpur
circuit house, but will do.

106
00:12:51,069 --> 00:12:54,004
Decide where all of you
are going to sleep.

107
00:12:54,072 --> 00:12:56,063
Do you want the window-side bed?

108
00:12:57,075 --> 00:12:59,066
Is it facing the road?
- Yes.

109
00:13:00,278 --> 00:13:02,439
No. This one is good for a writer.

110
00:13:04,282 --> 00:13:09,276
You will get a healthy person
beside you. - Healthy?

111
00:13:09,354 --> 00:13:11,345
Yes.
- See what's hanging there.

112
00:13:23,301 --> 00:13:25,292
Seems to be a person with taste.

113
00:13:43,054 --> 00:13:45,488
It seems that this has also
come with that person.

114
00:13:46,057 --> 00:13:48,321
You mean he has brought
this big mirror with him.

115
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:51,995
Must have a use. Mere shaving
is not the only purpose.

116
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:55,493
You mean he shaves the hair
on his chest. - Bodybuilder.

117
00:13:56,067 --> 00:13:59,332
Very good! Did you see how my
assistant is being prepared?

118
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:19,013
This place goes straight
to Dashashamedh.

119
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:23,290
Dashashamedh!? What a great place!

120
00:14:23,361 --> 00:14:26,296
Just arriving here has filled my heart
with a sense of devotion.

121
00:14:26,364 --> 00:14:28,355
Will that help you in your
job? You would not...

122
00:14:28,433 --> 00:14:30,424
...be writing a novel on devotion.

123
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:34,295
Correct.
What we want is thrill!

124
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:39,971
In my hotel, a 26 year old one,
this is the first time that...

125
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:42,309
...3 famous people are
staying together in a single room.

126
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,972
3 people!?

127
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:46,984
Famous detective, popular
novelist and in bed no. 4...

128
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:50,317
...Bishosri. - Bishosri?
That famous body builder?

129
00:14:50,388 --> 00:14:53,323
Have you seen him?
- Yes. On TV.

130
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:56,118
You won't believe,
I saw him eating...

131
00:14:56,194 --> 00:14:58,185
...he bent his hands to put the food
in his mouth...

132
00:14:58,263 --> 00:15:00,197
...and his hand was
bulging like this.

133
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:02,923
17 inches
- 17 inches?

134
00:15:03,001 --> 00:15:04,992
That's what he said.

135
00:15:06,004 --> 00:15:09,940
What about you? - My shirt
collar size is 16 inches.

136
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:15,436
Come, let's sit. I've ordered tea for you.

137
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:24,955
And yes! Do you know
inspector Tiwari?

138
00:15:25,023 --> 00:15:27,958
The one who was at Allahabad?
- Yes. He's posted here now.

139
00:15:28,293 --> 00:15:30,955
Yes, I think he had helped
me with a case there.

140
00:15:31,296 --> 00:15:33,958
I met him on the road, today.
I told him about you...

141
00:15:34,032 --> 00:15:36,023
...he said he will come here
to visit you.

142
00:15:37,035 --> 00:15:39,299
Is there anything exciting
going on in this place?

143
00:15:40,305 --> 00:15:42,296
I don't know whether
it's exciting or not.

144
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:44,968
But recently a powerful sage has arrived here,
he's said to possess...

145
00:15:45,043 --> 00:15:47,477
...magical powers, his
name is Machlibaba!

146
00:15:48,313 --> 00:15:50,975
Machlibaba!?
- Yes.

147
00:15:51,049 --> 00:15:53,040
He has swam straight from Prayag 
to Kashi.

148
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:55,143
What're you saying?! 
- Swam straight to this place from prayag!?

149
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,984
I'm not saying it, the people
are saying so.

150
00:15:58,056 --> 00:15:59,990
The English Channel is nothing compared
to this!

151
00:16:00,992 --> 00:16:03,051
He gives sermons at the
banks of the river...

152
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:05,119
...there's a devotional gathering,
then there's a...

153
00:16:05,196 --> 00:16:08,927
...session of devotional songs.
And if the Baba shows mercy...

154
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,936
...on someone, then he gives him
a 'Shalka' (a scale of fish) that day.

155
00:16:13,438 --> 00:16:17,932
Shalka!? What's a Shalka!?
- You're so vague.

156
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:21,001
Shalka is the scale of fish.

157
00:17:26,284 --> 00:17:29,947
Do you want, sir?
- What? - A 'Shalka' (a scale of fish) ?

158
00:17:30,021 --> 00:17:32,956
That sage has a radiance
on his face...

159
00:17:33,024 --> 00:17:35,959
...you've to accept it,
whatever you say.

160
00:17:41,299 --> 00:17:43,961
Is there any member of the public
among these devotees?

161
00:17:44,035 --> 00:17:46,026
Or are all of them
his paid devotees?

162
00:17:46,304 --> 00:17:49,296
What're you saying, sir!? They're
all the cream of Kashi.

163
00:17:49,374 --> 00:17:52,969
There. The one on the front,
wearing a black coat...

164
00:17:53,044 --> 00:17:55,979
...he's an agent of
the Allahabad Bank.

165
00:17:56,047 --> 00:17:58,481
The person beside him...
- He's a learned man. A great scholar.

166
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:01,969
And the one with the bald head,
he's the professor...

167
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:04,038
...of Benaras University.

168
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:10,252
And the greatest devotee...
there he comes.

169
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:17,985
Give me your binoculars.

170
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:31,436
Maganlal Meghraj. Haven't
you heard his name?

171
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:35,946
The one whose house was raided
a few days back in Kolkata.

172
00:18:36,014 --> 00:18:38,949
It's only a matter of time 
till the same thing happens here.
- Does he have a house here?

173
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:42,282
What're you saying, sir!
He has a house, farmhouse...

174
00:18:42,353 --> 00:18:44,344
...a private boat, everything!

175
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:05,299
His place is the nearest
to the sage, among all devotees.

176
00:19:05,376 --> 00:19:09,972
Nothing Unexpected!
- Excessive devotion is a common trait
of crooks.

177
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:29,990
It seems he's taking a gift with him.

178
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:32,326
The Baba isn't doing badly after all!

179
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:57,351
The Baba doesn't stay at one
place for a long time.

180
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:01,298
Then is his next stop at Patna?
- I don't know, sir.

181
00:20:02,033 --> 00:20:04,968
Will the Baba dive into
the Ganges from here?

182
00:20:54,352 --> 00:21:00,018
One Brahma, one sun, one moon.

183
00:21:02,293 --> 00:21:05,956
He's amazing. I don't know whether
he's a great swimmer

184
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:09,069
...but he's a great personality
for sure.

185
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:13,820
Two hands. Two legs.

186
00:21:13,821 --> 00:21:18,965
Two eyes. Two ears. Three
generations. Three periods.

187
00:21:19,477 --> 00:21:22,469
Four seasons. Four hearts.

188
00:21:23,481 --> 00:21:26,314
Five elements. Five fingers.

189
00:21:27,051 --> 00:21:30,316
Five senses. Five Pandavas.

190
00:21:31,055 --> 00:21:34,320
One, two, three, four and five.

191
00:21:38,062 --> 00:21:40,997
The Baba has a suspicious tattoo
on his hands.

192
00:21:41,332 --> 00:21:43,323
You've amazing eyesight, sir.

193
00:21:43,401 --> 00:21:45,494
I've come here before, but
I hadn't seen it.

194
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:47,561
See for yourself.

195
00:21:52,343 --> 00:21:56,006
- An aeroplane tattoo. I've seen
such a tattoo on Keshtoda's hands...

196
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,015
...in our colony.
- Let me see!

197
00:22:04,022 --> 00:22:06,013
Just a minute!

198
00:22:39,046 --> 00:22:41,437
Let me introduce
- Mr.Ghoshal & Mrs.Ghoshal.

199
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,324
He's the great detective, Mr.Pradosh Mitra.

200
00:22:44,395 --> 00:22:48,454
He's the most popular writer, Mr. Ganguly.
- And he's Tapesh.

201
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:51,331
Do you stay in Benaras?
- My father stays here.

202
00:22:51,402 --> 00:22:53,393
We come here for the Pujas.

203
00:22:53,471 --> 00:22:55,996
He's been here for 60 years.

204
00:22:57,075 --> 00:22:59,066
Are you staying in Calcutta lodge?

205
00:22:59,143 --> 00:23:01,077
Yes. In my place.

206
00:23:01,446 --> 00:23:05,940
Is it about some case?
- No. Just a holiday.

207
00:23:08,453 --> 00:23:13,288
I was asking you, because
I may need you.

208
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:18,962
I mean, the problem is that there's
been a theft in my house.

209
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:22,966
My father is a bit upset.
- Didn't you inform the police?

210
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:26,964
My father doesn't have much
faith in the police.

211
00:23:27,305 --> 00:23:32,299
But he's here. - That's why I
was thinking that I shall ask...

212
00:23:32,377 --> 00:23:36,313
...Father about it, if he agrees,
then I shall call you up.

213
00:23:37,148 --> 00:23:39,309
Alright.
- Ok. Then we shall leave now.

214
00:23:40,051 --> 00:23:42,042
As we've to go there for...

215
00:24:42,046 --> 00:24:46,983
I've heard of you. But I hadn't
seen you till now.

216
00:24:53,057 --> 00:24:55,992
There's a program on Saptami day.

217
00:24:56,327 --> 00:24:58,318
You can attend.

218
00:24:58,396 --> 00:25:00,921
Are those bubbles on your
arms, truly 17 inches?

219
00:25:14,278 --> 00:25:16,007
See.

220
00:25:28,292 --> 00:25:30,283
Touch it.

221
00:25:32,296 --> 00:25:36,289
Oh God! I don't get the feeling
that I'm touching a human body.

222
00:25:37,301 --> 00:25:39,292
It's just as I had told you.

223
00:25:41,038 --> 00:25:43,279
These are the triceps, feel it.

224
00:25:43,307 --> 00:25:46,299
Those were the biceps and
these are the triceps?

225
00:25:47,044 --> 00:25:49,035
Is there anything above triceps?

226
00:25:49,113 --> 00:25:51,104
Yes, quadriceps.

227
00:25:52,316 --> 00:25:56,980
What a great body you've built! 
A total buildup of muscles. 
- 400 here...

228
00:25:57,054 --> 00:26:01,923
...and 400 here. When you stretch like
this, that is a muscle.

229
00:26:01,993 --> 00:26:04,301
When you open your mouth...

230
00:26:04,302 --> 00:26:09,263
...it's a muscle. When you
chew something, that too is a muscle.

231
00:26:09,333 --> 00:26:13,269
For every movement in our body,
a muscle is involved.

232
00:26:14,272 --> 00:26:17,263
Does every muscle have
a separate name?
- Each and every.

233
00:26:18,276 --> 00:26:20,938
Write it down. It'll
help you in future.

234
00:26:22,013 --> 00:26:24,004
Really. We know so little.

235
00:26:24,081 --> 00:26:26,948
No! I wouldn't have believed
it, if I hadn't seen it.

236
00:26:28,286 --> 00:26:31,949
What dedication! - And
discipline too. - That's true.

237
00:26:36,127 --> 00:26:39,961
Leave him to me. I shall change
his body in just 2 months.

238
00:26:40,031 --> 00:26:44,297
What? Do you want to change?
- No. No. I don't need it.

239
00:26:45,303 --> 00:26:47,464
Do you bend rods?

240
00:26:50,141 --> 00:26:53,304
Yes. We've to do it.

241
00:27:00,985 --> 00:27:03,920
Do you lift weights?
- No. I don't do that.

242
00:27:05,256 --> 00:27:08,248
Whom do you want me to lift? You?
- No!

243
00:27:20,271 --> 00:27:23,934
You've got a telephone call.
- What? So soon?

244
00:27:44,128 --> 00:27:45,648
Did you see?

245
00:27:48,749 --> 00:27:50,966
Please do something.

246
00:27:54,305 --> 00:27:58,298
He won't listen to us.
Let's go inside.

247
00:28:05,983 --> 00:28:09,919
Welcome! Are you Pradosh Mitra?
- Yes.

248
00:28:09,987 --> 00:28:11,978
Mr. Ghoshal is expecting you.

249
00:28:14,992 --> 00:28:16,983
Come.

250
00:28:26,003 --> 00:28:27,994
Sit. I shall come.

251
00:28:38,015 --> 00:28:40,006
What a painting!

252
00:28:40,284 --> 00:28:42,275
How do you feel?

253
00:28:44,021 --> 00:28:46,956
Brother, they're modeling
the idols of Gods.

254
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,962
Wow! This God is like
the one in Kolkata.

255
00:28:59,303 --> 00:29:01,965
Kashi is the second
home for Bengalis.

256
00:29:02,306 --> 00:29:04,968
1.5 lakh Bengalis stay here,
in Kashi. - 1.5 lakh!

257
00:29:05,042 --> 00:29:07,033
Sarojda is coming by Doon express.

258
00:29:07,144 --> 00:29:10,477
Sister is also coming same day by
Amritsar mail. Receive both of them.

259
00:29:12,049 --> 00:29:15,985
Greetings. - We were looking
at the idols here.

260
00:29:17,488 --> 00:29:19,479
Come on. Come inside.

261
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:25,324
Father is a great follower
of detective stories.

262
00:29:25,396 --> 00:29:28,991
That's why he agreed when
I told him about you.

263
00:29:29,066 --> 00:29:33,332
Does he read a lot?
- All the time.

264
00:29:34,071 --> 00:29:36,062
Only English or also Bengali?

265
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:38,131
He leaves nothing.

266
00:29:38,209 --> 00:29:42,009
I wanted to know something.
Was that boy, your son?

267
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:45,344
Who? Rukku? He's the only child 
in the house.

268
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:48,010
He was standing at the edge
of the terrace wall.

269
00:29:48,085 --> 00:29:50,076
And was also targeting his play revolver towards us!

270
00:29:54,091 --> 00:29:56,082
Bikash!

271
00:29:57,361 --> 00:29:59,352
Send for him. He's on the terrace.

272
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:01,364
Tell him that Father is
calling him immediately.

273
00:30:05,302 --> 00:30:07,293
Leave it.

274
00:30:07,371 --> 00:30:09,362
Let me come to the point.

275
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:13,476
The thing that has been stolen,
is an idol of Lord Ganesha.

276
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:17,979
It's quite tall, made of gold.

277
00:30:18,048 --> 00:30:22,985
It's embellished with rubies,
emeralds, diamonds, etc.

278
00:30:24,054 --> 00:30:27,319
Its price... must be around a lakh.

279
00:30:28,058 --> 00:30:30,322
To which place does it belong?
- It belongs to Nepal.

280
00:30:30,394 --> 00:30:32,385
It was brought from there.

281
00:30:33,063 --> 00:30:36,999
That picture is that
of my great-grandfather,
Dr.Radhanath Ghoshal.

282
00:30:39,069 --> 00:30:41,503
He was the house-physician of the Rana.

283
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:46,007
Once, he rescued the Rana from a severe ailment.

284
00:30:46,076 --> 00:30:48,067
...And the Rana got pleased
and gave it to him.

285
00:30:49,079 --> 00:30:54,016
Since he got the Ganesha, many
small incidents...

286
00:30:54,084 --> 00:30:56,075
...created a belief
in the family...

287
00:30:56,153 --> 00:30:58,144
...that the Ganesha is very lucky.

288
00:30:58,355 --> 00:31:00,949
Did all these incidents
take place in Nepal?

289
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:05,291
No. Radhanath came down to
Kashi within a few days.

290
00:31:05,362 --> 00:31:08,957
He had his practice here, and
earned a lot of money and fame.

291
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:11,024
In fact, this house too,
was built by him.

292
00:31:11,469 --> 00:31:15,963
A few days before this idol was
stolen, a man offered to buy it.

293
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:20,477
And offered up to Rs. 30000.
- What's the name of that person?

294
00:31:20,544 --> 00:31:22,978
Maganlal. Maganlal Meghraj.

295
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:27,040
Did you know him?

296
00:31:27,117 --> 00:31:29,108
Yes. We studied in the same college.

297
00:31:29,186 --> 00:31:31,177
...And you refused to
sell it to him?

298
00:31:31,489 --> 00:31:35,323
Obviously,that thing doesn't belong to me.
It was brought by Radhanath.

299
00:31:35,392 --> 00:31:37,383
It's with my father,
in his trunk, now.

300
00:31:37,461 --> 00:31:40,988
And I stay in Kolkata.
- And what was Maganlal's reaction?

301
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:43,499
I obviously can't say that
he felt happy about it.

302
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:46,059
When did the theft take place?

303
00:31:46,136 --> 00:31:49,003
It took place, exactly the
next night of his visit.

304
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:51,064
Father came back the
next day and saw...

305
00:31:51,141 --> 00:31:53,132
...that the key was hanging
on the trunk...

306
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:55,201
...and the idol wasn't there.

307
00:31:56,347 --> 00:31:59,339
Is there any reason to doubt
anyone in the house?

308
00:32:00,017 --> 00:32:03,953
The servants, who're there,
are all old and reliable.

309
00:32:04,288 --> 00:32:09,282
And there's just Grandpa, Father,
me, my wife and Bikash.

310
00:32:11,028 --> 00:32:13,019
And
...your son.

311
00:32:20,037 --> 00:32:22,028
Did you climb the terrace walls?

312
00:32:22,306 --> 00:32:24,968
Why? What if you had fallen?

313
00:32:25,042 --> 00:32:27,033
Don't you know that
you shouldn't do so?

314
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:29,102
Captain Spark climbs the walls, too.

315
00:32:30,614 --> 00:32:31,648
Who!?

316
00:32:34,549 --> 00:32:37,982
He's a character in a mystery series.

317
00:32:39,056 --> 00:32:42,992
He climbs upside down.
- Yes. His head at the bottom...

318
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:45,051
...and his legs on top. Isn't it?

319
00:32:48,065 --> 00:32:51,000
Who's giving him such books? You?

320
00:32:52,069 --> 00:32:54,060
These days, all the boys...

321
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:57,005
You won't do any such thing. He'll
read all such weird books...

322
00:32:57,074 --> 00:33:00,009
...and get clouded with such
ridiculously dangerous ideas.

323
00:33:00,277 --> 00:33:02,268
If I hear again that you've
done any such thing...

324
00:33:02,346 --> 00:33:04,940
...then I shall lock
you up in your room. Go!

325
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:14,957
Who's Bikash? - Bikash
just stays in our house.

326
00:33:15,292 --> 00:33:17,954
He's the son of one of the
employees of my father.

327
00:33:18,028 --> 00:33:20,019
He lost his parents
while he was young.

328
00:33:20,097 --> 00:33:22,088
Since then, my father
brought him up himself.

329
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:25,966
What does he do? - He takes
care of the household chores.

330
00:33:26,036 --> 00:33:28,971
And does some ordinary job in
a Hindi publication company.

331
00:33:32,309 --> 00:33:34,971
If we could meet your father...

332
00:33:35,045 --> 00:33:37,036
Yes. He's waiting for you.

333
00:33:38,315 --> 00:33:40,977
One thing. Father is a
little short tempered.

334
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:45,982
And yes! Father doesn't know
about Magalal's visit.

335
00:33:46,056 --> 00:33:48,047
Take care.
- Ok. Take care.

336
00:33:55,065 --> 00:33:57,056
It seems that a gramophone
is playing.

337
00:33:57,134 --> 00:34:00,001
It's my grandfather. He's 84.

338
00:34:01,005 --> 00:34:03,940
Once upon a time, he was
very fond of music.

339
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:08,001
Now, the only thing that he
does is key the gramophone...

340
00:34:08,078 --> 00:34:10,069
...and change the records.

341
00:34:13,017 --> 00:34:15,952
Father, they've come.
- Let me see.

342
00:34:17,021 --> 00:34:19,012
How great a detective are you?

343
00:34:20,024 --> 00:34:23,488
Are you 6 feet tall?
- Yes.

344
00:34:23,489 --> 00:34:26,953
And he?
- I'm 5.5.

345
00:34:27,297 --> 00:34:29,959
I've no interest in your height.

346
00:34:30,467 --> 00:34:33,300
Detectives in novels have
a person with them.

347
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:37,304
Like Holmes had Watson. The
other one had Hastings.

348
00:34:37,374 --> 00:34:40,138
Our Byomkesh had Ajit.
Are you like that?

349
00:34:41,045 --> 00:34:45,982
This is my friend, Lalmohan Ganguly.
And this is my assistant...

350
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:48,041
...my cousin brother, Tapesh.

351
00:34:48,118 --> 00:34:52,987
Looking at your appearance, it
doesn't seem that you're dumb.

352
00:34:53,057 --> 00:34:58,986
That too, when the three of you
will be working together.

353
00:35:00,998 --> 00:35:02,989
Come. Let's sit in my
room and discuss.

354
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:10,931
I've kept records of everything.
This is the photo of my Ganesh.

355
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:23,447
Beautiful! - Not only beautiful,
it's a work of art.

356
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:28,958
It isn't a small thing. That's the
reason I don't believe that...

357
00:35:29,026 --> 00:35:32,291
...small things can't
change a man's life.

358
00:35:35,032 --> 00:35:37,967
Now see, detective sir.
Watch carefully.

359
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:42,966
This is the key of my trunk.
Here, I'm opening it.

360
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:48,301
Here's the key.

361
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:51,304
Come. Come.

362
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:58,478
Here's my trunk, I'm opening it.

363
00:36:02,993 --> 00:36:06,929
Here, I'm turning the handle .
Here's the drawer.

364
00:36:06,997 --> 00:36:09,261
Here's where my Ganesha was kept.

365
00:36:11,268 --> 00:36:15,932
The Ganesha isn't there. - How
was the trunk, after the theft?

366
00:36:16,006 --> 00:36:17,997
The drawer was open, the trunk...

367
00:36:18,075 --> 00:36:20,066
...was open, and the key was hanging.

368
00:36:27,451 --> 00:36:29,442
This is my bed.

369
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,954
I slept at 10.30 that night.

370
00:36:32,022 --> 00:36:34,286
Do you sleep at that time everyday?
- Yes.

371
00:36:35,025 --> 00:36:37,960
I have a habit of consuming opium.

372
00:36:38,462 --> 00:36:41,454
After 8 o'clock at night, I don't
have much awareness.

373
00:36:42,299 --> 00:36:46,963
But that night, while sleeping,
I heard a noise.

374
00:36:47,037 --> 00:36:52,976
I also made a noise, and upon 
hearing that the thief fled.

375
00:36:55,045 --> 00:36:57,036
Look at all this.

376
00:36:57,114 --> 00:36:59,480
Can you say what all these
are, assistant sir?

377
00:37:00,984 --> 00:37:02,975
Detective novels.

378
00:37:03,053 --> 00:37:05,725
I've memorized every book.

379
00:37:05,726 --> 00:37:09,424
So, cunningness won't work with me.

380
00:37:09,493 --> 00:37:13,930
If you're able to catch the thief,
then you'll be well rewarded.

381
00:37:15,265 --> 00:37:17,256
Or else, nothing.

382
00:37:20,003 --> 00:37:22,267
I've 2 questions.
- What?

383
00:37:24,007 --> 00:37:25,998
Why did you call me?

384
00:37:26,076 --> 00:37:28,067
You could've done this yourself.

385
00:37:28,145 --> 00:37:30,943
Had I been of your age, and
possessed your strength...

386
00:37:31,014 --> 00:37:33,005
...then I wouldn't have called you.

387
00:37:33,083 --> 00:37:36,951
Then second question is,
do you suspect anyone?

388
00:37:40,023 --> 00:37:42,958
None of the servants.

389
00:37:43,026 --> 00:37:45,085
I won't say anything more than that.

390
00:37:45,162 --> 00:37:47,153
The rest is your job.

391
00:37:58,141 --> 00:38:00,075
I had warned you earlier.

392
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:15,254
Can I go to the terrace?
- Of course.

393
00:38:15,325 --> 00:38:17,316
You can tour the house.

394
00:38:17,394 --> 00:38:19,385
I'll send Bikash with you.

395
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:21,931
You can tell him if
you need anything.

396
00:38:21,999 --> 00:38:23,990
Ok. C'mon.

397
00:39:49,686 --> 00:39:51,677
Is this the house of Captain Spark?

398
00:39:54,358 --> 00:39:57,020
If there's Spark, then there
must surely be an assistant.

399
00:39:57,361 --> 00:40:01,957
He's there.
- Raxit? - Yes.

400
00:40:03,467 --> 00:40:05,958
Khudiram Rakkhito. That
Rakkhito is Raxit.

401
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:12,131
The Ganesha was stolen despite...

402
00:40:12,209 --> 00:40:14,302
...the presence of Captain
Spark, in the house?

403
00:40:15,045 --> 00:40:17,980
How did this happen? Did
this happen for good?

404
00:40:18,048 --> 00:40:20,039
It's with a king.

405
00:40:22,052 --> 00:40:24,043
Which king?

406
00:40:24,121 --> 00:40:26,112
An African king.

407
00:40:26,323 --> 00:40:31,488
How did you know?
- Captain Spark knows it.

408
00:40:32,496 --> 00:40:35,329
Can't it be retrieved
from that king?

409
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:42,061
Spark will do it.
- Will he?

410
00:40:43,073 --> 00:40:45,337
Else it'll go back to Atlantis.

411
00:40:46,076 --> 00:40:48,510
The secret city under
the ocean? - Yes.

412
00:40:50,347 --> 00:40:53,009
It seems this boy has memorized
all detective novels.

413
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:56,012
Atlantis has been mentioned in
one of the detective books.

414
00:41:02,025 --> 00:41:04,016
Can I see Captain Spark's house?

415
00:41:44,067 --> 00:41:46,058
Here!

416
00:41:59,349 --> 00:42:01,283
Are you a detective?

417
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:06,284
Do you have an electric harpoon?

418
00:42:09,292 --> 00:42:11,283
X-Ray gun?

419
00:42:14,297 --> 00:42:16,288
Then what do you have?

420
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:19,291
What I have, isn't with me now.

421
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:26,031
The revolver that shoots?

422
00:42:27,043 --> 00:42:29,034
How many bullets?

423
00:42:31,047 --> 00:42:33,038
Six.

424
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:40,983
I can show it to you, only if
you promise me that you...

425
00:42:41,057 --> 00:42:43,321
...won't climb the terrace
walls, again.

426
00:42:47,063 --> 00:42:50,999
I've another weapon.
It can't be seen.

427
00:42:52,335 --> 00:42:55,998
What?
- Intelligence. It's kept over here.

428
00:42:58,074 --> 00:43:02,943
Sometimes, it suddenly enters
a person's mind, and learns...

429
00:43:03,013 --> 00:43:05,004
...all that is stored there.

430
00:43:07,017 --> 00:43:11,283
It's saying that Captain Spark
likes to talk in Hiyali.

431
00:43:11,354 --> 00:43:13,345
Do you know Hiyali?

432
00:43:14,457 --> 00:43:18,291
'It is a strange thing. You
chew it and it tastes good'.

433
00:43:22,032 --> 00:43:24,023
Do you know Hiyali?

434
00:43:24,301 --> 00:43:27,964
'Five brothers are together,
eating rice with fish'.

435
00:43:28,038 --> 00:43:31,303
'There are five more.
How do you do? '

436
00:43:32,475 --> 00:43:38,311
'Five brothers are together,
eating rice with fish'.

437
00:43:39,049 --> 00:43:43,315
'There are five more.
How do you do? '

438
00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:50,985
Ok. I shall have to leave now.

439
00:43:51,328 --> 00:43:53,990
Your grandfather has given me a job.

440
00:43:54,064 --> 00:43:56,328
If I'm unable to do it,
then I'll be defamed.

441
00:43:56,399 --> 00:44:00,927
What's your name?
- My good name is Captain Felu.

442
00:44:01,004 --> 00:44:03,268
And real name is Pradosh Mitra.

443
00:44:08,278 --> 00:44:11,941
Come. Tea has been ordered
for you. Come.

444
00:44:19,289 --> 00:44:22,281
What's Rukku's good name?
- Rukmini Kumar.

445
00:44:23,026 --> 00:44:25,017
Are you Raxit?
- What?

446
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:29,965
Captain Spark's assistant.

447
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:32,962
I'm won't be surprised
if I'm made one.

448
00:44:33,303 --> 00:44:38,297
Because last year, he was Tintin,
and I was Captain Haddock.

449
00:44:52,322 --> 00:44:54,984
Since when did the painting start?

450
00:44:55,325 --> 00:44:59,989
Since when did you start painting,
Shashibabu? - Since Saturday.

451
00:45:01,998 --> 00:45:06,264
Does he stay here?
- No. He comes from Ganeshmohalla.

452
00:45:08,271 --> 00:45:13,937
It's Shashti, the day after. Will
your job be over by then?

453
00:45:16,279 --> 00:45:18,270
Yes. It'll be over.

454
00:45:22,018 --> 00:45:24,009
Come. Let's go to your room.

455
00:45:29,292 --> 00:45:33,956
Were you there when Maganlal came?

456
00:45:34,030 --> 00:45:38,296
Yes. I took him to the sitting room.
- How long was he here?

457
00:45:38,368 --> 00:45:40,359
Around a half hour.

458
00:45:47,043 --> 00:45:50,910
Were you in your room?
- Yes.

459
00:45:51,811 --> 00:45:54,813
What where you doing?

460
00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:58,310
I was listening to music.

461
00:45:59,322 --> 00:46:02,257
Radio?
- Yes, ghazal.

462
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:13,934
Which station?
- Lucknow.

463
00:46:25,014 --> 00:46:28,950
Since when are you here?
- Since 20 years. From '57.

464
00:46:29,018 --> 00:46:32,283
Do you like it?
- I've got used to it.

465
00:46:49,038 --> 00:46:51,029
I think you're aware of
your weak position.

466
00:46:53,042 --> 00:46:55,033
There's nothing to
be aware of.

467
00:46:55,111 --> 00:47:00,242
I'm no one here. Just living 
in the Ghoshal house.

468
00:47:01,251 --> 00:47:03,913
Had I had any interest
in the Ganesha...

469
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:08,253
...then I could've done so,
a long time back.

470
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:15,254
I've had no recent developments
requiring any money as such.

471
00:47:16,266 --> 00:47:18,257
Has that happened to anybody else?

472
00:47:19,269 --> 00:47:22,261
Forgive me. I won't be able
to comment on this matter.

473
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:25,998
If commenting on that improves
your position...

474
00:47:26,075 --> 00:47:28,441
...then refusing to comment,
would be foolish.

475
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:34,950
Don't forget. You had
both the reason...

476
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:38,283
...and the opportunity to steal.

477
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:43,288
Reason?
- Freedom from staying here.

478
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:48,020
If you have anything
to say, then say it.

479
00:47:48,298 --> 00:47:50,960
Deciding whether it's true
or false is my duty.

480
00:47:56,039 --> 00:48:00,908
Umanathbabu's business
hasn't been going well lately.

481
00:48:02,245 --> 00:48:04,907
You'll come to know of it,
if you investigate.

482
00:48:04,981 --> 00:48:07,916
And you also have that opportunity.

483
00:48:07,984 --> 00:48:09,975
Bikash! Tea!

484
00:48:10,253 --> 00:48:11,914
C'mon.

485
00:48:18,995 --> 00:48:20,986
Is everything alright?
- Yes. Everything's fine.

486
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:23,055
The salt, spice, etc...
- I didn't know that...

487
00:48:23,132 --> 00:48:25,123
...you could get such
a huge fish in Kashi!

488
00:48:25,201 --> 00:48:27,931
I've arranged for it with
great difficulty, sir.

489
00:48:28,004 --> 00:48:29,995
Don't give up, at least
as long as we are here.

490
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:32,940
And yes! Don't worry if your
job doesn't end...

491
00:48:33,009 --> 00:48:33,998
...within 10 days.

492
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:36,944
I've already booked 3 beds for you.

493
00:48:37,013 --> 00:48:39,277
Thank you. But the job will
end in 10 days...

494
00:48:39,349 --> 00:48:41,340
...else it never will.

495
00:48:41,417 --> 00:48:43,942
No! Don't say such a thing,
in Kashi, that too, in my...

496
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:47,285
...Calcutta lodge, one of your
adventures should be remembered.

497
00:48:47,357 --> 00:48:49,348
Let's see.

498
00:48:53,296 --> 00:48:55,287
Lalmohanbabu isn't saying anything.

499
00:48:56,299 --> 00:48:59,291
Despite the eternal creation of Jatayu
Prakhar Rudra...

500
00:48:59,369 --> 00:49:03,965
...Captain Spark is taking away
away all the attention.

501
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:07,976
How can he like that?
- You're right.

502
00:49:08,311 --> 00:49:10,302
It means that you aren't the only...

503
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:12,974
...popular detective novelist in
the country. You've a rival.

504
00:49:13,483 --> 00:49:15,974
Yesterday's brat! The one
that stays in Darjipada.

505
00:49:16,052 --> 00:49:19,988
He writes under a synonym. I
wrote an edition in 3 days...

506
00:49:20,056 --> 00:49:22,320
...and he hasn't finished
one in 3 months.

507
00:49:24,327 --> 00:49:29,321
...And he's the creator of
the character Spark...

508
00:49:29,399 --> 00:49:33,995
If Captain Spark gets an idea, then a spark
flashes from his forehead.

509
00:49:34,070 --> 00:49:36,004
Brilliant!

510
00:49:38,341 --> 00:49:40,332
You've got a phone call,
shall I ask him...

511
00:49:40,410 --> 00:49:43,345
...to call back after 10 minutes?
- No. I shall attend to it.

512
00:49:55,358 --> 00:49:59,351
Is this Mitra?
- Yes. - I'm Maganlal Meghraj.

513
00:49:59,429 --> 00:50:01,294
Oh! Greetings!

514
00:50:01,364 --> 00:50:03,958
I saw you at the ashram
of Machlibaba yesterday.

515
00:50:04,033 --> 00:50:06,024
How did you recognize me?

516
00:50:06,102 --> 00:50:08,969
I have my own methods. There're
people to show me.

517
00:50:09,472 --> 00:50:11,303
I can understand that.

518
00:50:11,374 --> 00:50:13,365
What are you doing this afternoon?
- Why?

519
00:50:13,443 --> 00:50:16,310
Come over to my place. I've
something to talk to you about.

520
00:50:17,313 --> 00:50:19,304
But I don't know your house.

521
00:50:19,382 --> 00:50:21,976
Do you know Gyanvapi?
- Yes. I know.

522
00:50:22,051 --> 00:50:26,317
My man will be at Gyanvapi. Blue
shirt, his name's Manohar.

523
00:50:26,389 --> 00:50:28,380
He'll bring you along.

524
00:50:29,325 --> 00:50:31,316
But there'll be two
more people with me.

525
00:50:31,394 --> 00:50:33,385
Your own people?
- Yes, my own people.

526
00:50:33,463 --> 00:50:35,454
Then bring them along, too.

527
00:50:35,531 --> 00:50:37,499
I'm waiting.
- Ok.

528
00:50:52,348 --> 00:50:54,339
Have you done the right thing?

529
00:50:54,417 --> 00:50:56,408
I haven't compelled you to come.

530
00:50:57,186 --> 00:51:00,952
No. I mean that one can't resist
meeting such a person.

531
00:51:01,290 --> 00:51:03,281
That's why we've come.

532
00:51:12,468 --> 00:51:15,301
If he offers anything,
don't say yes.

533
00:51:15,371 --> 00:51:18,966
Why? - Who knows, what
he might give.

534
00:52:49,165 --> 00:52:54,501
Oh! Where are you?
- I'm here. I'm in front of you.

535
00:52:56,072 --> 00:52:59,337
No. It's just that...
- Sit. Sit on the mattress...

536
00:52:59,408 --> 00:53:01,342
...or if you want, then on the sofa.

537
00:53:02,278 --> 00:53:07,272
I had a wish to meet you.
I've heard of your job.

538
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:09,341
Even I've heard of your fame.

539
00:53:09,418 --> 00:53:12,444
Why are you saying fame? Say
defame, tell the truth.

540
00:53:15,024 --> 00:53:18,460
Is that boy your brother?
- No. A cousin.

541
00:53:19,028 --> 00:53:22,283
My uncle's son.
- And him?

542
00:53:22,284 --> 00:53:25,297
Uncle?
- He's my friend.

543
00:53:34,310 --> 00:53:36,301
All are Lal!

544
00:53:40,316 --> 00:53:42,307
Bring cold drinks.

545
00:53:45,321 --> 00:53:47,983
We ate before we came. Lunch.

546
00:53:48,324 --> 00:53:50,986
So what if you've eaten?
You've walked from that...

547
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:54,325
...Calcutta lodge to our house.
That food must've gotten digested.

548
00:53:56,332 --> 00:53:59,995
What about you, Felubabu?
- I don't know about you, but mine has.

549
00:54:08,010 --> 00:54:10,945
Have you come to Benaras
for a holiday?

550
00:54:11,447 --> 00:54:14,280
That was my intention.
- If that was your intention...

551
00:54:14,350 --> 00:54:16,341
...then why did you change your mind?

552
00:54:22,291 --> 00:54:25,954
It's my mind, after all. Where's
the restriction of changing it?

553
00:54:26,028 --> 00:54:29,964
There's no restriction, but why
are you wasting your time?

554
00:54:31,033 --> 00:54:33,024
Go and visit the various temples.

555
00:54:37,039 --> 00:54:40,975
I've my own boat, you can
visit all the 80 banks...

556
00:54:41,043 --> 00:54:43,034
...and it won't cost you
even a single penny.

557
00:54:43,112 --> 00:54:46,603
Your mind will be refreshed...
breathing the air of the Ganges

558
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:51,315
...instead of doing all this, why are you 
wasting your time at the Ghoshal's house?

559
00:54:53,155 --> 00:54:56,488
You're forgetting that I'm
a professional detective.

560
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:58,993
Mr. Ghoshal has given me a job.

561
00:54:59,061 --> 00:55:00,995
The question of holidaying
without completing it doesn't arise.

562
00:55:09,438 --> 00:55:13,272
What's your fee?
- It depends on the job.

563
00:55:22,118 --> 00:55:25,952
It's Rs. 2000. Take the money
and stop your job.

564
00:55:31,127 --> 00:55:34,460
I don't charge any money,
without working for it.

565
00:55:34,530 --> 00:55:38,296
Work? What'll you
achieve by working?

566
00:55:38,367 --> 00:55:40,961
You won't be able to do anything
after catching the thief.

567
00:55:41,304 --> 00:55:44,467
Why?
- The thief is your client, himself.

568
00:55:46,042 --> 00:55:48,033
What are you saying?

569
00:55:48,110 --> 00:55:50,977
Do you know that Umanath Ghoshal
has stolen the...

570
00:55:51,047 --> 00:55:53,038
...Ganesha from his father's trunk...

571
00:55:53,115 --> 00:55:55,106
...and sold it to me for Rs. 30000?

572
00:55:55,318 --> 00:55:57,980
Do you know how weak
he is, financially?

573
00:55:58,321 --> 00:56:00,255
Do you know how much
he has to repay?

574
00:56:00,423 --> 00:56:03,915
Will you go and tell his father
that his son has stolen the...

575
00:56:03,993 --> 00:56:05,984
...Ganesha from his trunk?

576
00:56:06,262 --> 00:56:08,253
He had refused you.

577
00:56:08,998 --> 00:56:11,933
He changed his mind, after refusing.

578
00:56:12,268 --> 00:56:14,930
After changing his mind,
the next day...

579
00:56:15,004 --> 00:56:18,940
...he gave me the idol at
the ashram of Machlibaba.

580
00:56:19,008 --> 00:56:23,274
And I had given him
300 Rs. 100 notes.

581
00:56:24,013 --> 00:56:26,948
We visited the ashram, as well
as did our job. That's it.

582
00:56:27,283 --> 00:56:29,945
You're an intelligent man, Mr.Mitra.

583
00:56:30,453 --> 00:56:34,947
Not ordinary intelligence, but
extraordinary intelligence.

584
00:56:37,026 --> 00:56:39,017
If you come to know the truth...

585
00:56:39,095 --> 00:56:41,290
...then it'll be a problem
for both of us.

586
00:56:41,364 --> 00:56:43,958
So you take that money,
and give up this job.

587
00:56:44,033 --> 00:56:46,024
This is my request.

588
00:57:10,993 --> 00:57:14,258
Then the Ganesha must be with you.
- Yes.

589
00:57:15,431 --> 00:57:17,422
Can I see it?

590
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:21,266
What are you saying, Mr.Mitra? My
house in Calcutta was raided...

591
00:57:21,337 --> 00:57:23,328
...why would I keep the
idol in my house?

592
00:57:24,273 --> 00:57:26,935
To know whether you're telling
the truth or not...

593
00:57:27,009 --> 00:57:29,273
I've to continue doing my job.

594
00:57:32,014 --> 00:57:33,548
Am I lying?

595
00:57:34,249 --> 00:57:38,283
The opposite of true is false, Maganlalji.

596
00:57:40,289 --> 00:57:42,280
You do not believe my words?

597
00:57:46,028 --> 00:57:49,293
There's Rs. 2000 there. Take
and enjoy your holidays.

598
00:57:49,365 --> 00:57:51,458
Take a tour with your uncle.

599
00:58:07,983 --> 00:58:09,974
I don't accept bribes, Maganlalji.

600
00:58:16,992 --> 00:58:18,983
Then you'll continue with your work?

601
00:58:23,265 --> 00:58:25,256
Send for Arjun.

602
00:58:25,434 --> 00:58:27,925
Bring box no. 13.

603
00:58:32,274 --> 00:58:37,268
What, Halwamohanbabu? Didn't
you like the juice?

604
00:58:41,283 --> 00:58:44,946
Don't worry, Mohanbabu. That
juice isn't poisoned.

605
00:58:49,024 --> 00:58:51,959
I feel that poison is
a very bad thing.

606
00:58:52,294 --> 00:58:54,285
Yes.
...Yes!

607
00:58:56,298 --> 00:58:59,290
Other things are more useful than poison.

608
00:59:20,055 --> 00:59:22,046
A collection of knives!

609
00:59:35,938 --> 00:59:39,874
Are you feeling well?
- Just a little fever.

610
00:59:39,942 --> 00:59:42,877
It's alright.
- Will you perform today?

611
00:59:47,950 --> 00:59:49,941
Have you seen knife throwing, sir?

612
00:59:51,954 --> 00:59:54,889
The king of Harbanspur
had a private circus.

613
00:59:55,958 --> 01:00:00,224
The knife thrower of his circus
now performs in mine.

614
01:00:14,977 --> 01:00:19,243
Ok then, shall we go?
- Where will you go?

615
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:24,242
It's already 2.30...
- So what?

616
01:00:24,987 --> 01:00:27,922
You've to rest a bit.
- No! First, Arjun...

617
01:00:27,990 --> 01:00:31,255
...will perform, only
then will we go.

618
01:00:38,934 --> 01:00:42,969
Are you ready?
- Oh yes! - Then start.

619
01:00:49,211 --> 01:00:51,873
Come, Uncle.
- What is your intention?

620
01:00:55,951 --> 01:01:00,217
Uncle will stand in front of the board,
and Arjun will perform.

621
01:01:01,223 --> 01:01:03,214
What do you think of yourself?

622
01:01:09,231 --> 01:01:12,894
Hey fool! I shall break your bones!

623
01:01:12,968 --> 01:01:14,959
I had told you to shoot, only
when he pulled out his pistol...

624
01:01:15,037 --> 01:01:17,028
...who told you to shoot now?

625
01:01:17,239 --> 01:01:20,231
Forgive me, sir.
- Is this your aim?

626
01:01:20,309 --> 01:01:24,905
I'll penalize you for this mistake.
- Forgive me, sir.

627
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:26,971
I made a mistake.

628
01:01:27,049 --> 01:01:29,916
Two pistols, two bullets
have been pointed at you.

629
01:01:29,985 --> 01:01:31,976
Don't dare to disobey me!

630
01:01:36,191 --> 01:01:39,183
By not believing me,
you've insulted me.

631
01:01:39,261 --> 01:01:41,252
If you do not create any more trouble,
then nothing will happen.

632
01:01:41,330 --> 01:01:43,321
Not even to Uncle.

633
01:01:43,399 --> 01:01:45,867
But if you carry on your investigation at
Ghoshal's house again...

634
01:01:45,935 --> 01:01:47,926
...then I won't be able to
guarantee your safety.

635
01:01:48,003 --> 01:01:49,994
I'm clearly warning you.

636
01:01:50,205 --> 01:01:54,869
Get up, Mohan! Get up!

637
01:02:09,959 --> 01:02:11,950
What happened?

638
01:02:22,972 --> 01:02:26,408
Just a minute. Let
me drink the juice.

639
01:02:46,929 --> 01:02:48,920
What have you added to the juice?

640
01:02:49,932 --> 01:02:52,196
I'm feeling amazingly strong.

641
01:02:53,202 --> 01:02:56,194
Arjun, are you ready?
- Yes.

642
01:02:58,207 --> 01:03:02,200
Where do I have to stand? Here?
- Yes. There.

643
01:03:05,214 --> 01:03:07,375
Means, here?
- Yes.

644
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:17,949
Just a minute.

645
01:03:25,234 --> 01:03:31,202
Here, take my watch. My wallet.

646
01:03:38,914 --> 01:03:41,178
Ready Arjun?
- Yes.

647
01:03:48,190 --> 01:03:50,181
Just a minute.

648
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:53,351
Just a minute.

649
01:04:05,207 --> 01:04:07,368
Hail Baba Vishwanath!

650
01:04:08,944 --> 01:04:11,879
Wow! That's great!

651
01:04:25,394 --> 01:04:27,385
You're a lion!

652
01:04:35,170 --> 01:04:37,161
Amazing! Good!

653
01:05:22,951 --> 01:05:24,942
Your salary will be increased!

654
01:05:29,057 --> 01:05:31,048
Great!

655
01:05:36,899 --> 01:05:38,890
Wow! Look at it!

656
01:05:56,919 --> 01:06:00,855
I had told you, Mr.Mitra.
Arjun is excellent!

657
01:06:04,193 --> 01:06:08,857
Uncle! Come out. The game's up!

658
01:06:16,939 --> 01:06:18,930
Come out!

659
01:06:24,947 --> 01:06:26,938
Lalmohanbabu!

660
01:06:35,891 --> 01:06:37,882
Get some milk and nuts for Uncle.

661
01:07:01,183 --> 01:07:04,175
How much?
- What's it normally, for you?

662
01:07:04,253 --> 01:07:07,848
72.
- Then it has to reduce by 25 more.

663
01:07:08,190 --> 01:07:10,852
See
...It'll come down right now.

664
01:07:11,927 --> 01:07:14,862
I'm feeling a lot more relieved now.
A lot!

665
01:07:25,941 --> 01:07:28,876
At least it's over now!

666
01:07:28,944 --> 01:07:31,879
You hadn't seen it. It was
like living 5 lives in one.

667
01:07:36,885 --> 01:07:38,876
They don't say it for no reason...

668
01:07:38,954 --> 01:07:40,945
...that truth is stronger
than fiction.

669
01:07:47,996 --> 01:07:51,830
Go ahead with the case,
I'm with you.

670
01:07:56,905 --> 01:08:02,844
What happened? Hello? Are
you planning to give up?

671
01:08:04,012 --> 01:08:09,177
I'm responsible for what
happened to you, today.

672
01:08:11,186 --> 01:08:13,177
No! What are you saying!

673
01:08:13,255 --> 01:08:16,190
This was just my fate. It was
written in my fate.

674
01:08:16,959 --> 01:08:19,860
But I'm still alive!
Alive and healthy!

675
01:08:21,196 --> 01:08:23,187
Forget what happened, today.

676
01:08:24,933 --> 01:08:26,924
Either I'll take revenge
for this...

677
01:08:27,002 --> 01:08:29,197
...or I'll give up my profession.

678
01:08:40,949 --> 01:08:42,940
What happened?

679
01:08:44,953 --> 01:08:46,944
Are you leaving?

680
01:08:47,956 --> 01:08:49,947
You've a show, the day after.

681
01:08:54,229 --> 01:08:56,220
What happened?

682
01:08:56,298 --> 01:08:59,233
This is dangerous, sir. I
can't stay here any longer.

683
01:08:59,301 --> 01:09:01,394
What happened?
- Don't ask. See.

684
01:09:09,978 --> 01:09:11,969
Beware!

685
01:09:19,988 --> 01:09:21,979
From where did you get this?

686
01:09:22,257 --> 01:09:27,923
It was near the window.
Someone must've left it.

687
01:09:27,996 --> 01:09:29,987
Do you have any enemies here?

688
01:09:30,999 --> 01:09:34,196
You would've known, had
you been in my place.

689
01:09:36,938 --> 01:09:39,873
Who wants to get involved in a Police case?

690
01:09:40,942 --> 01:09:44,207
You've a 17.5 inch tricep...
- Bicep!

691
01:09:44,946 --> 01:09:46,937
And you're afraid of this
ordinary threat?

692
01:09:47,015 --> 01:09:49,006
You aren't able to understand
the matter.

693
01:09:49,084 --> 01:09:52,383
I'm not a coward.
- Then why are you leaving?

694
01:09:55,223 --> 01:09:57,214
Have you seen Angelo's David?

695
01:10:01,231 --> 01:10:05,222
Oh! That one.
That's really great.

696
01:10:07,402 --> 01:10:10,894
Our body is a work of art. A temple.

697
01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:15,403
And the muscles on that
are the designs.

698
01:10:18,246 --> 01:10:20,908
Did you hear that?
- Amazing.

699
01:10:22,984 --> 01:10:26,920
Did you understand? - Means you've
to take care of your temple.

700
01:10:28,990 --> 01:10:32,255
Isn't that so?
- I can tell you one thing, Mr.Bagchi.

701
01:10:32,994 --> 01:10:34,928
You aren't the one who
has been threatened.

702
01:10:34,996 --> 01:10:36,987
I've been threatened.

703
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:40,191
Your introduction?

704
01:10:40,268 --> 01:10:43,863
His is about this. About
mind and intelligence.

705
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:49,204
He isn't into building muscles
here and there. Am I right?

706
01:10:50,212 --> 01:10:54,876
I guarantee one thing to you. Even
if something happens here.

707
01:10:54,950 --> 01:10:57,885
Your body will be safe.
- are you sure?

708
01:10:57,953 --> 01:10:59,944
One hundred percent true.

709
01:11:00,021 --> 01:11:02,888
therefore,
- Don't let the Bengali club sink.

710
01:11:02,958 --> 01:11:05,893
Everyone sees the Bishwanath
temple in Kashi.

711
01:11:06,228 --> 01:11:08,389
But how many see the
Bishosri temple?

712
01:11:12,234 --> 01:11:14,225
A bowl full of blood.

713
01:11:16,972 --> 01:11:21,238
Did you think of mother Durga
as an ordinary woman?

714
01:11:21,309 --> 01:11:26,906
She hurls the trident into his
chest, and blood spurts out.

715
01:11:27,249 --> 01:11:28,238
Yes.

716
01:12:43,925 --> 01:12:45,916
Did you call for me?

717
01:12:48,196 --> 01:12:49,857
Sit.

718
01:13:02,210 --> 01:13:06,874
I hadn't told Mr.Mitra one thing.
As it can't be said.

719
01:13:07,215 --> 01:13:09,206
But I'm telling it to you.

720
01:13:11,953 --> 01:13:17,892
That day, even if I hadn't seen
someone entering my room...

721
01:13:17,959 --> 01:13:22,896
...I had seen one leaving.
He was a gentleman.

722
01:13:24,966 --> 01:13:27,901
There are just two gentlemen in this
house, me and Bikash, Father.

723
01:13:30,405 --> 01:13:36,241
You have hidden your conversation
with Maganlal from me.

724
01:13:39,180 --> 01:13:41,171
Maganlal had offered you money...

725
01:13:41,249 --> 01:13:44,844
...I came to know about it
through someone else.

726
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:48,855
I didn't feel that it was important
for you to know that.

727
01:13:48,923 --> 01:13:52,359
Maganlal had asked for the Ganesha,
but I had refused him.

728
01:13:53,194 --> 01:13:55,856
However if it gets proved that...

729
01:13:55,930 --> 01:13:57,921
...you had opened my trunk...

730
01:13:57,999 --> 01:14:01,196
...then the appropriate
punishment for that...

731
01:14:01,269 --> 01:14:03,260
...you have to face it.

732
01:15:14,943 --> 01:15:18,208
Maganlal hasn't got the Ganesha yet.

733
01:15:21,950 --> 01:15:23,144
He hasn't!?

734
01:15:23,218 --> 01:15:25,880
Had he got it, then he wouldn't
have offered me so much...

735
01:15:25,954 --> 01:15:28,889
...money to stop my work.
- Then where's the Ganesha?

736
01:15:35,163 --> 01:15:39,156
I believe... the Ganesha is
still in Ghoshal's house.

737
01:15:40,168 --> 01:15:42,830
That means Umanath hasn't sold it?

738
01:15:44,172 --> 01:15:48,836
Umanath, had he stolen it, wouldn't...

739
01:15:48,910 --> 01:15:53,847
...have recommended us to his father.

740
01:15:55,183 --> 01:16:00,849
And Raxit?
- Had Bikash stolen it...

741
01:16:01,189 --> 01:16:03,180
...then he wouldn't have stayed here.

742
01:16:05,026 --> 01:16:09,861
That's right. But where
did the Ganesha go?

743
01:16:11,366 --> 01:16:17,202
Who opened the trunk,
where the idol was taken afterwards ...

744
01:16:19,207 --> 01:16:22,199
...and how Maganlal hopes to
possess it...

745
01:16:22,277 --> 01:16:25,212
only mother Ganga knows
about it, till now.

746
01:23:41,182 --> 01:23:43,173
Mr. Mitra!

747
01:23:46,187 --> 01:23:48,178
How are you?
- Fine. How are you?

748
01:23:49,924 --> 01:23:51,915
Fine. I heard that you've started...

749
01:23:51,993 --> 01:23:54,860
...working, even after coming here?
- What to do? There's no one...

750
01:23:54,929 --> 01:23:56,920
...to pay us a salary. We've
to keep doing something.

751
01:23:56,998 --> 01:23:58,989
Will you drink tea?
- Yes.

752
01:24:02,804 --> 01:24:05,866
Tell me.
- Will you take my advice?

753
01:24:05,940 --> 01:24:07,931
First, let me hear
what the advice is.

754
01:24:10,211 --> 01:24:12,202
Have you heard of Maganlal?

755
01:24:12,947 --> 01:24:14,938
Not only have I heard of him...

756
01:24:15,016 --> 01:24:17,007
...I spent an hour
with him yesterday.

757
01:24:17,084 --> 01:24:19,075
What? You didn't tell me about it.

758
01:24:19,153 --> 01:24:21,144
He showed me the performance
of his private circus.

759
01:24:21,222 --> 01:24:22,883
Offered me a drink.

760
01:24:22,957 --> 01:24:25,892
What's your opinion?
- An extraordinary crook.

761
01:24:27,228 --> 01:24:31,892
Do you know? There was a theft
in Benaras, a few days back...

762
01:24:31,966 --> 01:24:34,833
...in Mr. Badrinarayan's house.
A Nataraj idol.

763
01:24:36,170 --> 01:24:39,333
And Maganlal had been to that
house, 4 days before the theft.

764
01:24:39,907 --> 01:24:42,341
Then what? Search his house,
you'll get the idol

765
01:24:43,911 --> 01:24:45,902
Maganlal isn't such
a foolish person.

766
01:24:45,980 --> 01:24:48,847
It is my intention to
exceed his cunningness.

767
01:24:48,916 --> 01:24:51,851
Forget about the threat to
my life, just tell me...

768
01:24:51,919 --> 01:24:53,910
...will I get your help,
when I need it?

769
01:24:53,988 --> 01:24:58,186
You know that. You've seen
it before in Allahabad.

770
01:25:19,947 --> 01:25:21,938
Laxman!

771
01:25:28,956 --> 01:25:30,947
Take this.

772
01:26:14,368 --> 01:26:17,360
It's 10:30.
- Were you thinking of returning to the hotel?

773
01:26:19,206 --> 01:26:24,870
I was thinking 
- why not explore the bylanes of Kashi at night.

774
01:26:26,944 --> 01:26:29,883
...Check out the atmosphere of the place.

775
01:26:31,052 --> 01:26:33,043
C'mon.

776
01:26:35,156 --> 01:26:40,150
Is there any African king in
any of your stories? - Yes.

777
01:26:42,163 --> 01:26:46,827
Gorillar Gograj. In it,
King Mahanto. - What?

778
01:26:46,901 --> 01:26:50,837
Have you written about a
gorrilla in that place!?

779
01:26:51,906 --> 01:26:55,842
That's nothing.

780
01:26:55,910 --> 01:26:59,246
Read my latest book
...you won't get a chance
to take your eyes off it.

781
01:26:59,318 --> 01:27:01,909
Tell,Tapesh.
How was the book?

782
01:27:02,188 --> 01:27:05,851
Excellent! Especially, the part
where he hides the diamond.

783
01:27:08,925 --> 01:27:12,861
The villain steals a huge diamond,
and hides it in the front...

784
01:27:12,929 --> 01:27:18,194
...I mean, the front portion
of the jaws of his pet crocodile, with cellotape.

785
01:27:18,265 --> 01:27:20,256
Can't it be seen,
even when its mouth opens?

786
01:27:20,334 --> 01:27:22,325
That's the climax!

787
01:27:22,937 --> 01:27:25,872
The crocodile on seeing the hero 
opened its mouth to kill him. 

788
01:27:25,940 --> 01:27:29,876
And so the hero saw the stone,
took out his rifle and shot the crocodile.

789
01:27:30,211 --> 01:27:31,872
Excellent!

790
01:27:39,616 --> 01:27:42,816
I would've been happy
had there been some noise around.

791
01:27:42,890 --> 01:27:44,881
This is too lonely.

792
01:27:44,959 --> 01:27:46,950
Has your stock of courage lessened?

793
01:27:47,027 --> 01:27:49,018
No! Do you know what the problem is?

794
01:27:49,096 --> 01:27:51,087
Courage is not like muscles.

795
01:27:51,165 --> 01:27:54,828
Take Bagchi's biceps. Even in front of Yama,
it remains 17.5.

796
01:27:54,902 --> 01:27:56,893
Courage goes up and comes down.

797
01:27:56,971 --> 01:27:58,836
Is your courage coming down?

798
01:27:59,173 --> 01:28:01,164
I'm going because you're here.

799
01:28:01,242 --> 01:28:03,836
Otherwise, in this street at night?

800
01:28:05,179 --> 01:28:08,512
Have a look at those courtyards,

801
01:28:08,513 --> 01:28:11,846
every house is haunted.

802
01:28:12,186 --> 01:28:15,849
Go inside, and you can see bats
hanging from the ceiling.

803
01:28:15,923 --> 01:28:18,858
I won't be surprised
if I see a vampire.

804
01:28:21,028 --> 01:28:24,574
The bat says that you'll see

805
01:28:24,575 --> 01:28:27,866
something amazing tonight.

806
01:28:29,937 --> 01:28:33,632
Tonight, bats and vampires shall

807
01:28:33,633 --> 01:28:36,866
come, and everyone will die.

808
01:28:46,220 --> 01:28:48,211
Shashibabu!

809
01:29:00,234 --> 01:29:03,397
The Ghoshal house has no connection
with the death of Shashi.

810
01:29:03,971 --> 01:29:05,962
He has been murdered by his son.

811
01:29:08,242 --> 01:29:10,904
It's such that the son had gone
for a movie at late hours.

812
01:29:10,978 --> 01:29:13,913
There was a cold war going on
between the father and the son.

813
01:29:13,981 --> 01:29:15,972
In fact, it's being said
that the son had...

814
01:29:16,050 --> 01:29:18,041
...even threatened his father.

815
01:29:18,118 --> 01:29:21,918
I feel that if I pressure a bit,
then the truth will come out.

816
01:29:39,206 --> 01:29:41,868
Don't mistake me. But
after your arrival...

817
01:29:41,942 --> 01:29:44,877
...the crime rate in
Kashi has increased.

818
01:29:44,945 --> 01:29:46,936
There has been a murder in
Chaukammatha, yesterday.

819
01:29:48,215 --> 01:29:52,048
What's needed now,

820
01:29:52,049 --> 01:29:54,882
is just a brain wave.

821
01:29:56,957 --> 01:29:58,948
You don't believe in all this, sir.

822
01:29:59,026 --> 01:30:01,017
Just take a dip in the river...

823
01:30:01,095 --> 01:30:04,394
...tomorrow morning, you'll see that
your brain has been cleared.

824
01:30:06,967 --> 01:30:09,231
I didn't believe in it for 30 years.

825
01:30:09,970 --> 01:30:14,907
I was troubled by gastritis.
Allopath, homeopath, jinxes...

826
01:30:14,975 --> 01:30:16,966
...ayurveda, I didn't miss anything.

827
01:30:18,245 --> 01:30:21,908
Then I thought one day, what's
the harm in trying it?

828
01:30:22,249 --> 01:30:24,240
Then I woke up at 5, and had a dip.

829
01:30:25,252 --> 01:30:27,243
That's it.

830
01:30:29,990 --> 01:30:32,254
Faith has an effect to some extent,
not in everything.

831
01:30:34,194 --> 01:30:38,858
Is there any program?
- Yes. Akhtar's music show.

832
01:30:38,932 --> 01:30:41,867
Is it today? - No. It was supposed
to be on Saturday...

833
01:30:41,935 --> 01:30:44,199
...singers were supposed
to come from Lucknow.

834
01:30:48,942 --> 01:30:50,933
Don't you change the towels?

835
01:30:56,216 --> 01:30:58,207
What happened? You're
looking tense.

836
01:30:58,285 --> 01:31:00,276
Won't you have your breakfast?

837
01:31:09,229 --> 01:31:11,220
I still have some doubt 
about three things.

838
01:31:12,232 --> 01:31:13,221
Doubt!?

839
01:31:15,969 --> 01:31:20,235
Africa's king, Shashibabu's 'Shingh'

840
01:31:23,243 --> 01:31:25,234
and Akhtar's song.

841
01:31:32,986 --> 01:31:36,854
Is that 'Singh', a Punjabi surname,
or Rajasthani?

842
01:31:37,925 --> 01:31:41,861


843
01:31:49,203 --> 01:31:51,865
What's the first thing that hits
your mind on hearing of Africa?

844
01:31:51,939 --> 01:31:55,204
Jungle.
- And jungle? - Animal.

845
01:31:56,210 --> 01:31:58,201
And king of animals?

846
01:32:21,969 --> 01:32:23,960
Where's Rukku? He isn't to be seen.

847
01:32:24,037 --> 01:32:26,904
He has been sitting in the room
on the terrace, since morning.

848
01:32:26,974 --> 01:32:30,910
Why? - The idol was being
placed, and he tripped over it.

849
01:32:30,978 --> 01:32:32,969
And naturally it was...

850
01:32:49,196 --> 01:32:51,858
I've brought a revolver,
won't you see?

851
01:32:53,200 --> 01:32:56,863
Where's the revolver? - Open the
door, and I'll show it to you.

852
01:33:15,222 --> 01:33:18,885
Here, see it. This
is a real revolver.

853
01:33:18,959 --> 01:33:22,224
Its name is Colt. It has 6 bullets.

854
01:33:39,913 --> 01:33:43,849
The king of Africa is the vehicle
of Goddess Durga, the lion.

855
01:33:43,917 --> 01:33:46,852
And you had hidden the Ganesha
in the lion's mouth...

856
01:33:46,920 --> 01:33:48,854
...with chewing gum.

857
01:33:48,922 --> 01:33:51,186
Isn't it so? - Else, Gondariya
would've taken it away.

858
01:33:51,258 --> 01:33:53,249
He had told father that
he would take it way.

859
01:33:53,327 --> 01:33:55,852
Gondariya is Captain Spark's enemy.

860
01:33:58,198 --> 01:34:04,194
You had heard it.
- Yes. - What happened after that?

861
01:34:05,205 --> 01:34:07,867
After that, I went to Raxit.

862
01:34:07,941 --> 01:34:10,876
Raxit, a man has come, downstairs.

863
01:34:10,944 --> 01:34:14,880
He's saying that he'll
buy your Ganesha.

864
01:34:14,948 --> 01:34:16,939
He's saying that he'll buy it?
- Yes.

865
01:34:17,017 --> 01:34:21,886
Who is that?
- Dacoit Gandariya alias Maganlal.

866
01:34:21,955 --> 01:34:25,220
He's talking to Father. He'll
give him a lot of money.

867
01:34:29,396 --> 01:34:31,887
He's saying that he'll
give a lot of money?

868
01:34:32,966 --> 01:34:35,161
It isn't sounding good,
Captain Spark.

869
01:34:35,903 --> 01:34:37,894
C'mon. Let's hide the Ganesha.

870
01:34:37,971 --> 01:34:39,962
Where do we hide it?

871
01:34:40,040 --> 01:34:43,840
That day, you told me a story
that a man had hidden a...

872
01:34:43,911 --> 01:34:45,902
...diamond, within his
crocodile skin dress.

873
01:34:45,979 --> 01:34:48,846
Similarly, we, too, will hide
it in the mouth of the lion.

874
01:34:48,916 --> 01:34:54,183
Lion!? - The vehicle of
Goddess Durga. - Ok.

875
01:34:57,190 --> 01:34:59,852
And if anyone asks you about it, then tell him...

876
01:34:59,927 --> 01:35:02,862
...that it's with the king of Africa.

877
01:35:02,930 --> 01:35:07,867
Ok. - And we shall remove it
on the eve of the immersion.

878
01:35:07,935 --> 01:35:11,200
Else, it'll sink and go into the deep waters
of Atlantis.

879
01:35:11,939 --> 01:35:17,878
Did you hear the old man's antics?
- Yes. I did.

880
01:35:19,212 --> 01:35:23,876
But there is one whose antics
have superceeded yours... - What?

881
01:35:23,951 --> 01:35:26,042
Let me introduce him to you.

882
01:35:26,954 --> 01:35:28,318
Know him.

883
01:35:30,419 --> 01:35:33,883
No one's courage
can match that of his.

884
01:35:35,162 --> 01:35:38,825
He's the writer of 'Karal 
Kumbhir', Jatayu.

885
01:35:38,899 --> 01:35:41,834
Jatayu! Are you Jatayu?

886
01:35:41,902 --> 01:35:45,167
He's just exaggerating things.
I'm nothing of that kind.

887
01:35:45,238 --> 01:35:48,173
Then, my Ganesha was
saved because of you.

888
01:35:48,241 --> 01:35:51,836
But the Ganesha isn't there.
- What?

889
01:35:52,179 --> 01:35:54,170
There's nothing in the lion's mouth.

890
01:35:54,247 --> 01:35:56,238
Only the chewing gum is there.

891
01:36:03,924 --> 01:36:07,860
You had called for me, to
catch the thief, isn't it?

892
01:36:07,928 --> 01:36:10,863
That's true. There was
nothing in the trunk...

893
01:36:10,931 --> 01:36:12,922
...when the thief came.

894
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,867
But we've to see who fiddled
with my trunk.

895
01:36:15,936 --> 01:36:19,201
The one who has the
wrong intentions, is the thief.

896
01:36:19,272 --> 01:36:23,868
But now it appears that not only he has 
the wrong intentions, 
- he has also done the wrong actions.

897
01:36:31,385 --> 01:36:33,876
I had sent Bikash to buy sweets.
- Where?

898
01:36:37,157 --> 01:36:40,320
You can find him, if you go, now.

899
01:37:00,013 --> 01:37:02,846
What are you thinking about?

900
01:37:02,916 --> 01:37:05,851
About Bikash's surname.
- Bikash 'Shingha'[Lion].

901
01:37:14,928 --> 01:37:19,865
Tell me, Mr.Mitra. Where? Ram temple?

902
01:37:21,201 --> 01:37:23,192
Ok. Alright.

903
01:37:55,168 --> 01:37:57,830
Good morning. I was
searching for you.

904
01:37:57,904 --> 01:38:01,840
Me? - I had to talk to you
about something. - Now?

905
01:38:01,908 --> 01:38:03,899
It's important. It
can't be told here.

906
01:38:03,977 --> 01:38:05,968
Let's find a lonely place.

907
01:38:06,046 --> 01:38:08,844
But, I was...
- You can buy the sweets later.

908
01:38:08,915 --> 01:38:10,906
C'mon now. We shall come back.
- Ok.

909
01:38:11,184 --> 01:38:15,177
The one that's tickling your
hips, is a gun.

910
01:38:15,255 --> 01:38:17,246
So,
Don't try to escape!

911
01:38:56,229 --> 01:38:58,220
Sit.

912
01:39:02,068 --> 01:39:06,903
The person whose one lie has been caught,
he can't be trusted anymore.

913
01:39:08,241 --> 01:39:10,232
You weren't listening
to the radio that day.

914
01:39:10,977 --> 01:39:12,968
You were listening to Maganlal's
conversation.

915
01:39:13,046 --> 01:39:15,913
Isn't it so? Tell me.

916
01:39:18,251 --> 01:39:20,913
Tell me what happened next.

917
01:39:20,987 --> 01:39:23,922
If you lie, you'll get
trapped further.

918
01:39:24,257 --> 01:39:25,918
Speak up.

919
01:39:27,260 --> 01:39:31,924
Maganlal saw that I was listening
to him, secretly.

920
01:39:32,265 --> 01:39:35,860
After that?
- He sent for me the next day.

921
01:39:35,936 --> 01:39:37,927
He gave me an advance of Rs. 500.

922
01:39:38,004 --> 01:39:41,371
Said that he'll give me another
Rs. 500 if I steal the Ganesha.

923
01:39:41,942 --> 01:39:44,795
And a job in Kolkata.

924
01:39:44,796 --> 01:39:48,871
I don't have any future here.

925
01:39:48,949 --> 01:39:53,215
Believe me! - After that?
What happened after that?

926
01:39:53,286 --> 01:39:57,222
I opened the trunk, but
the Ganesha wasn't there.

927
01:39:59,059 --> 01:40:03,894
Then, last evening, I was in my
room at that time, suddenly...

928
01:40:13,974 --> 01:40:17,239
I haven't committed any sin, sir.

929
01:40:18,245 --> 01:40:20,907
I swear on God.

930
01:40:20,981 --> 01:40:24,246
Believe me!
- Where did you get it?

931
01:40:24,317 --> 01:40:30,316
It was... it was in front of
the idol. On the floor.

932
01:40:30,991 --> 01:40:33,926
I don't know who kept it there.

933
01:40:35,929 --> 01:40:38,864
This... give this to Mr. Ghoshal.

934
01:40:39,933 --> 01:40:42,868
I went to Maganlal with the
Ganesha, that very night.

935
01:41:02,956 --> 01:41:04,947
Sit.

936
01:41:08,962 --> 01:41:10,953
Where did you get this?

937
01:41:11,965 --> 01:41:14,900
It was in front of the
idol, in our house.

938
01:41:14,968 --> 01:41:17,903
I didn't find it.
- You didn't find it?

939
01:41:18,238 --> 01:41:21,401
Shashi Babu.
- Shashi Babu?

940
01:41:21,975 --> 01:41:24,409
Our sculptor, he gave it to me.

941
01:41:26,246 --> 01:41:29,747
He won't tell anyone.

942
01:41:29,748 --> 01:41:33,914
He's a very good person.

943
01:41:35,989 --> 01:41:38,856
Moreover, he isn't that
kind of a person.

944
01:41:39,926 --> 01:41:41,917
Where is he now?

945
01:41:45,932 --> 01:41:48,207
He is a very good man.

946
01:41:48,208 --> 01:41:52,861
I mean, very good. He
is about 70 years old.

947
01:41:54,207 --> 01:41:56,869
Where is his house?

948
01:41:58,211 --> 01:42:00,202
Do you know his house?

949
01:42:07,954 --> 01:42:09,945
I won't be able to...

950
01:42:15,962 --> 01:42:19,898
I know what you can do
and what you can't.
- You just show it to us...

951
01:42:19,966 --> 01:42:23,902
...the rest will be taken care of 
by someone else.

952
01:42:31,244 --> 01:42:33,906
I haven't committed the murder.

953
01:42:34,180 --> 01:42:37,343
Believe me, Mr.Mitra. I haven't
committed the crime.

954
01:42:38,184 --> 01:42:40,846
You need not have told me about that.

955
01:42:41,921 --> 01:42:44,185
You wouldn't have been
able to do that kind of thing.

956
01:42:45,358 --> 01:42:48,850
Come, Mr.Tiwari. As of now,
he's your guest.

957
01:42:50,930 --> 01:42:52,921
He's just a part of the plot.

958
01:42:53,933 --> 01:42:55,924
Have to make other arrangemments
to catch the big fish.

959
01:42:56,369 --> 01:42:58,360
Come. Come with me.

960
01:43:04,944 --> 01:43:06,935
Is this that thing?
- Yes.

961
01:43:07,947 --> 01:43:09,938
Tell me the spelling.

962
01:43:20,226 --> 01:43:22,217
Now write, deltoid.

963
01:43:28,234 --> 01:43:31,897
Wow!  Is it Deltroid?
- No. Deltoid.

964
01:43:31,971 --> 01:43:33,905
Oh! 'toid' not 'r' ?
- No.

965
01:43:34,174 --> 01:43:36,836
A Call for you?
- For me?

966
01:43:43,183 --> 01:43:45,845
Listen, you've some work
to do. Listen carefully.

967
01:43:45,919 --> 01:43:47,910
This evening at 5,
you and Jatayu...

968
01:43:47,987 --> 01:43:49,978
...will come to Machlibaba's ashram.

969
01:43:51,024 --> 01:43:54,858
Exactly at 5.
- And you? - I'll meet you.

970
01:43:54,928 --> 01:43:57,863
It's something serious.
- I've understood.

971
01:43:57,931 --> 01:44:02,868
And at around 3, a member of the
Bengali club, Shushanto Bose...

972
01:44:02,936 --> 01:44:06,201
...will visit your place with
makeup and dresses. - Ok.

973
01:44:07,941 --> 01:44:09,932
And take care that Lalmohanbabu
doesn't act over smart.

974
01:44:10,944 --> 01:44:13,879
It's something serious. And
bring along some sweets to eat.

975
01:44:13,947 --> 01:44:15,938
I haven't eaten anything all day.

976
01:44:16,216 --> 01:44:18,207
I understood, but...

977
01:44:55,188 --> 01:44:57,179
Hail! Lord Shiva!

978
01:45:14,941 --> 01:45:17,876
What's this?...

979
01:45:40,166 --> 01:45:42,828
He'll come on time. Keep quiet.

980
01:45:55,181 --> 01:45:57,172
Look behind you.

981
01:49:04,404 --> 01:49:06,895
You've just seen bullets, Maganlal.

982
01:49:09,242 --> 01:49:15,238
But you haven't seen a trap.

983
01:49:16,249 --> 01:49:19,241
Arrested! - You've been caught
red-handed this time!

984
01:49:22,255 --> 01:49:26,919
Now, you've got to see the performance
of my private circus.

985
01:49:29,996 --> 01:49:34,194
How much money do you want? Mr.Mitra.
How much? Tell me.

986
01:49:34,934 --> 01:49:37,869
Those who kill innocent people,
with the help of thugs.

987
01:49:39,939 --> 01:49:43,875
Those who eat out of the
treasures of the country.

988
01:49:45,978 --> 01:49:48,879
They won't be freed,
by coughing up money.

989
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:06,899
Come, Mr. Tiwari.
- Come, Mr. Meghraj.

990
01:50:18,244 --> 01:50:21,236
Oh! Some ink has fallen.
- Ok.

991
01:50:22,248 --> 01:50:24,910
I shall send two more books
after reaching Kolkata.

992
01:50:27,253 --> 01:50:29,915
Do you know him, dear?
- Who is he?

993
01:50:30,256 --> 01:50:32,918
He's Captain Felu's assistant.

994
01:50:33,426 --> 01:50:35,860
What's your name?
- Captain Topshe.

995
01:50:36,362 --> 01:50:41,857
I understood all that. But why
hasn't Captain Felu arrived yet?

996
01:50:42,201 --> 01:50:44,863
He'll come. He'll come
within an hour or two.

997
01:50:44,937 --> 01:50:47,872
He has to change his dress,
and remove the makeup.

998
01:50:47,940 --> 01:50:49,931
But he doesn't go back on his word.

999
01:50:50,009 --> 01:50:52,000
But I haven't come to know whether...

1000
01:50:52,078 --> 01:50:55,206
...he got back the Ganesha or not.
- Are you still unsure?

1001
01:50:57,049 --> 01:50:59,040
Don't misunderstand. I got delayed...

1002
01:50:59,118 --> 01:51:01,211
...as I had to attend to another job.

1003
01:51:03,222 --> 01:51:05,884
Here, take your Ganesha.
- Ganesha!

1004
01:51:09,962 --> 01:51:11,953
Thank God!

1005
01:51:13,232 --> 01:51:15,894
What you showed, can only
be read in books.

1006
01:51:16,235 --> 01:51:18,897
Will you let me see it?
- Here, have a look.

1007
01:51:21,240 --> 01:51:23,231
You're incomparable.

1008
01:51:25,077 --> 01:51:27,068
Let me put it back in its place.
- Yes.

1009
01:51:29,982 --> 01:51:31,973
It's an old treasure of mine.

1010
01:51:36,923 --> 01:51:40,859
Go back to your house. Go
back to your house, O Lord!

1011
01:51:49,201 --> 01:51:51,192
Let us have some sweets
to celebrate.

1012
01:51:52,204 --> 01:51:53,865
I've work.

1013
01:51:59,378 --> 01:52:02,870
Please tell me how much I should
give you as your fees.

1014
01:52:05,952 --> 01:52:07,943
Before you write the
check, I would...

1015
01:52:08,020 --> 01:52:10,011
...like to show you something else
with your permission.

1016
01:52:10,089 --> 01:52:12,216
Go on. Why do you need
permission for that?

1017
01:52:13,225 --> 01:52:16,888
Then see. See carefully.

1018
01:52:19,966 --> 01:52:24,466
Here, I'm opening the drawer.

1019
01:52:24,467 --> 01:52:27,236
This is the key.

1020
01:52:31,978 --> 01:52:35,175
Now, I'm opening the trunk.

1021
01:52:44,190 --> 01:52:48,017
Here is my reward.

1022
01:52:48,018 --> 01:52:50,857
What is a reward?

1023
01:52:51,197 --> 01:52:56,863
You may be reading a lot
of detective novels...

1024
01:52:56,936 --> 01:52:58,927
...but I'm a detective myself.

1025
01:52:59,005 --> 01:53:00,996
It isn't easy to fool me.

1026
01:53:07,213 --> 01:53:12,879
I've verified it. The price of
this can't be more than Rs. 2000.

1027
01:53:13,953 --> 01:53:16,888
Had this been the real Ganesha,
then you wouldn't...

1028
01:53:16,956 --> 01:53:20,892
...have hidden it in the lion's
mouth, along with your grandson.

1029
01:53:21,227 --> 01:53:26,221
Am I right?
- You're a genius.

1030
01:53:26,399 --> 01:53:29,232
Your actual Ganesha is
in the bank, isn't it?

1031
01:53:29,301 --> 01:53:32,896
Yes. Of course. Everyone who comes
wants to see it.

1032
01:53:32,972 --> 01:53:35,839
And I've to open the trunk
for that, every time.

1033
01:53:35,908 --> 01:53:38,342
It's such a costly thing.
A work of art.

1034
01:53:39,178 --> 01:53:41,169
Did you hear, Captain Spark?

1035
01:53:41,247 --> 01:53:43,238
Your grandfather has hidden
the actual Ganesha.

1036
01:53:43,315 --> 01:53:46,182
That's why, I'm taking
this fake Ganesha. Ok?

1037
01:53:46,252 --> 01:53:50,848
Is this the fruit of your actions?
- Yes. My fruit.

1038
01:53:51,190 --> 01:53:52,885
Do I have your permission?

1039
01:53:52,958 --> 01:53:56,860
Of course.
- The one
who's so intelligent...

1040
01:53:56,929 --> 01:53:58,920
...must get a handsome reward.

1041
01:53:58,998 --> 01:54:03,196
But how did you get it?
- I know.

1042
01:54:03,936 --> 01:54:05,927
By his weapon of intelligence.
