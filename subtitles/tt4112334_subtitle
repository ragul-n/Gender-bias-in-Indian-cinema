1
00:00:24,833 --> 00:00:28,041
"High voltage wire."

2
00:00:28,208 --> 00:00:29,833
"High voltage wire."

3
00:00:29,958 --> 00:00:33,583
"High voltage wire."

4
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:36,041
"Beat the drums to sync
with his song, and sing."

5
00:00:36,166 --> 00:00:37,833
"Watch this VIP
walking elegantly."

6
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:39,750
"He pounced with flair
making the ground shake."

7
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:41,625
"He matched his moves
with talent in all respects."

8
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,541
"This handsome dude
is approved by a local star."

9
00:00:43,708 --> 00:00:45,458
"He flashed like breaking news."

10
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:47,833
"Take a proper look at our favorite star."

11
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:59,708
"Greetings, ladies and gentlemen."

12
00:01:02,541 --> 00:01:08,041
"Be careful, if you touch me
you'll find yourself in difficulty."

13
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:13,916
"My gaze is like a firecracker."

14
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:18,041
"You can't find the right rival
even if you search in Google."

15
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:21,791
"I am in fact equivalent
to electric current."

16
00:01:21,958 --> 00:01:25,416
"If you switch on your power,
you'll be in danger!"

17
00:01:25,666 --> 00:01:29,291
"I am in fact equivalent
to electric current."

18
00:01:29,416 --> 00:01:33,833
"If you provoke me unnecessarily
I shall bring the universe down."

19
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:59,833
"I won't button up my shirt fully.
I'll raise my collar and roam around."

20
00:01:59,958 --> 00:02:03,583
"If anyone acts like a rowdy,
I'll shatter his ribs bloody."

21
00:02:03,708 --> 00:02:07,333
"A cynosure to all eyes,
just a golden hearted guy."

22
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:11,208
"If you cross my path, you won't find
even calcium in your bones left behind."

23
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:14,958
"Caste! My blood doesn't discriminate.
Religion! My mind doesn't differentiate."

24
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:17,958
"I am not a boy ordinary.
Underline this, it's compulsory!"

25
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:22,291
"I am in fact equivalent
to electric current."

26
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:26,125
"If you switch on your power.
watch out, you're in danger!"

27
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,750
"I am in fact equivalent."

28
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:33,250
"If you switch on your power"

29
00:02:33,375 --> 00:02:37,333
"I am in fact equivalent
to electric current."

30
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:41,958
"If you provoke me unnecessarily
I shall bring the universe down."

31
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,791
<i>Parvathipuram</i>

32
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,833
I'm on the way to
Mr. Sivarama Raju's house.

33
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:06,166
This is his house.

34
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:08,416
Why have you come here?

35
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:10,083
I want to meet
Mr. Sivarama Raju.

36
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:12,416
He's inside. Please go in.
- Okay.

37
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:20,500
Greetings, ma'am.

38
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,875
I have come to see sir.

39
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:24,958
He's praying.
Please sit down.

40
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:29,500
<i>Praise be to Lord Shiva,
the God of Destruction.</i>

41
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:35,666
<i>Lord Venkateshwara, Vinayaka,
Saibaba and Goddess Durga.</i>

42
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:36,875
<i>Praise be to all the Gods.</i>

43
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,541
<i>Bless the people
of this town.</i>

44
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:57,416
Greetings, sir.
- Hello, Circle Inspector!

45
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:59,166
What is the purpose
of your visit?

46
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:02,958
When your daughter
eloped with her lover..

47
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:06,708
When she went away
with her lover

48
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:09,791
village folks were claiming
that you killed them, sir.

49
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:20,250
The superintendent of police sent me
in person to confirm if it was true.

50
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:29,083
Yes, I killed them!

51
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:38,500
We won't let you
arrest him!

52
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:04,125
<i>His name is Sivarama Raju.</i>

53
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:06,500
<i>He is a bigwig
in Parvathipuram.</i>

54
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:10,375
<i>He has no sons
but 3 daughters.</i>

55
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:13,958
<i>He regarded this gun
as his eldest son.</i>

56
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:15,916
<i>The gun is a symbol
of his dignity.</i>

57
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:18,083
<i>His moustache is his prestige.</i>

58
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:22,125
Why are you sneezing?
Shall I call for a doctor?

59
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:23,916
Fool! Why?

60
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:26,333
Even that sneeze
likes our boss.

61
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:29,791
Isn't it? - May no one cast an evil eye on him.
He sneezed beautifully!

62
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:32,708
If we ordinary folks sneeze,
it is considered inauspicious.

63
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,958
He sneezing is a good omen.
- Well said!

64
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:37,500
<i>These 4 are the orchestra
of Mr. Sivarama Raju.</i>

65
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:41,541
<i>They feel, even his sneeze sounds
like maestro Ilaiyaraja's music.</i>

66
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:44,583
<i>Sivarama Raju went hunting
with his friends often.</i>

67
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:47,416
<i>Sivarama Raju thought himself
to be an expert at hunting.</i>

68
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:50,375
<i>But until now he hasn't
even shot a sparrow.</i>

69
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:58,916
<i>His name is Veeraraju.</i>

70
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:02,041
<i>He was an expert at
deriding people skillfully.</i>

71
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:06,791
<i>17 years ago, these two fought.</i>

72
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:09,125
<i>Give sweets to them also.
Sivarama Raju has been blessed with a baby girl.</i>

73
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,250
<i>Is that so?
- Yes.</i>

74
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:12,833
<i>Has Goddess Lakshmi been
born as your daughter?</i>

75
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:18,125
<i>Even when the first born is a girl
everyone blames it on their fate.</i>

76
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:22,833
<i>This is your third daughter
and you're distributing sweets.</i>

77
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:27,166
<i>Not just three.. Even if I have two more girls,
I'll distribute sweets all over again.</i>

78
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:29,541
<i>Now you'll say so.</i>

79
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:32,333
<i>Tomorrow when she grows up,
falls in love and elopes</i>

80
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:35,416
<i>then you'll know
the true joy of it.</i>

81
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:38,125
<i>Would you still then
distribute sweets?</i>

82
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,916
<i>Watch your words
else I'll snip off your tongue.</i>

83
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:42,500
<i>As if you're a celebrity!</i>

84
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:44,625
<i>He's insulting you.
Why are you quiet?</i>

85
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,875
<i>He can just watch
but can't do anything.</i>

86
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:54,833
<i>You've chopped
my boss' ear.</i>

87
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:57,708
<i>How dare you
chop my ear!</i>

88
00:06:57,833 --> 00:07:01,541
<i>If you insult me further,
I'll slit your throat too.</i>

89
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:03,916
<i>You're such a gentleman.
Is this how you behave?</i>

90
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:07,083
<i>I can behave like a gentleman
if the other person behaves well.</i>

91
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:10,416
<i>What will you do</i>

92
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:12,375
<i>if your daughter
elopes the way I predicted?</i>

93
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:16,458
<i>Forget eloping, even if one
of his daughters falls in love</i>

94
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:19,625
<i>my boss will
chop off both his ears.</i>

95
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,291
<i>Otherwise, he will
kill both of them.</i>

96
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:23,166
<i>Are you okay
with this bet?</i>

97
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:24,791
<i>Okay!</i>

98
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:27,041
<i>Same here.</i>

99
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:37,375
Mr. Sivarama Raju,
are you fine?

100
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,666
I'm on top of the world.

101
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:42,125
Both my daughters
are well settled.

102
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,708
One son-in-law is a lawyer and
the other is a police officer.

103
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:46,958
If the third daughter
marries a doctor

104
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:49,958
law and order, and health
will be under the same roof!

105
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:54,666
All marriages won't happen
as per your plan, Mr. Siva.

106
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:57,166
Your third daughter
is still single.

107
00:07:57,291 --> 00:08:01,750
Boys nowadays focus only on
falling in love, nothing else.

108
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:03,875
And they revel in it.

109
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,625
<i>"High voltage wire."</i>

110
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,125
<i>"High voltage wire."</i>

111
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,833
<i>"High voltage wire."</i>

112
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:19,375
<i>"High voltage wire."</i>

113
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:34,916
Stop.. Stop.

114
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:36,625
Why did you stop?

115
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,666
You belong to
the neighboring village.

116
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:38,833
You don't know him.

117
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,291
He's Raju, the President
of the VIP union.

118
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:42,958
We can go only when
he moves aside.

119
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,416
Is he such a big shot?

120
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:51,416
If an electric wire is on
the ground or pole

121
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:52,500
we must be cautious.

122
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:53,958
You know what will
happen if we stamp on it!

123
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:55,083
What will happen?

124
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:59,166
Listen to me. Don't honk.
- Wait.

125
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:01,125
You don't know him.
- Wait.

126
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,666
Let's see.

127
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:05,958
<i>"High voltage wire."</i>

128
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:08,750
<i>"High voltage wire."</i>

129
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:12,791
Are you checking
if your horn works?

130
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:16,166
If you saunter in the middle
of the road, will we all

131
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:18,416
welcome you with a red
carpet instead of honking?

132
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,458
Wow! What a rhyme!

133
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:24,291
Your rhyming skills are good
but your sense of timing is zero.

134
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:27,916
Oh! Are you carrying sand?

135
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:31,125
Superb!
Then carry on. Go.

136
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:33,833
Okay, go.
- Keep quiet.

137
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:36,208
Your grandfather
is waiting. Go.

138
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:40,750
Hello! Is it the MRO?

139
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:42,333
Yes, who is this?

140
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:44,500
MLA, MP, Raju speaking!

141
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,375
Yes MA, MPhil, speaking.

142
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:48,375
What has happened
to our country?

143
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,500
Going to the dogs.
What do you want?

144
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,250
Sand is vanishing
into thin air here, sir.

145
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:54,958
If we turn a blind eye

146
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:58,666
our women will have to go to
another planet to fetch water.

147
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:00,750
If you don't take action

148
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:03,500
you can watch my reaction
in front of the collector's office.

149
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:09,125
Stop! Stop..

150
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:10,666
I told you.
You didn't listen.

151
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:12,041
Keep quiet.

152
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:13,625
Do you know who
owns this tractor?

153
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:17,041
Don Shankar. - Let it be a don or God Himself
but you must obey my orders.

154
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:19,666
Because Raju, the President of
VIP union has complained.

155
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:21,166
Constables, seize the vehicle.

156
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:23,416
I told you not to provoke him.
He'll make your life miserable.

157
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:25,458
How will we now face
our boss, Don Shankar?

158
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:39,958
<i>He is Don Shankar.</i>

159
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:43,250
<i>Specializes in being a goon,
murder and seizing lands.</i>

160
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:48,458
<i>He's cruel and ruthless.</i>

161
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:54,666
Were you twiddling your thumbs
when he seized the tractor?

162
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:58,958
Raju from Parvathipuram
complained, sir.

163
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:01,166
How does that matter?
Why didn't you slit his throat?

164
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:02,833
Hey, Seenu!
- Sir.

165
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:04,916
It's trivial.

166
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:06,625
Ignore it.

167
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,791
Who is Raju?
- He heads the VIP union.

168
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:18,125
Raju!

169
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:20,458
Dad..
- What, son?

170
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:22,500
You've become too lazy.

171
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:23,916
Serve me food. Fast.

172
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:25,791
I'm coming. Wait.

173
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:32,750
Serve the gravy
for the rice.

174
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:36,750
Even though you are
educated, you're jobless.

175
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:38,500
When folks ask me
what you are up to

176
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:39,666
I don't even know what to say.

177
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:41,166
Then tell them that
you don't know.

178
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:43,166
I find it tough to
cook all by myself.

179
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:46,291
I too find it tough to eat
what you've cooked!

180
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,916
Have you fed the dog?

181
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:51,541
Oh no! I forgot.

182
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:52,875
Don't ever
make that mistake.

183
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:56,208
I might forget to
be faithful to you!

184
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:57,958
Isn't my 'sambar' tasty?

185
00:11:58,166 --> 00:11:59,833
If you make a gravy
without adding any spices

186
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:01,458
how will it be tasty
or edible, dad?

187
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:03,416
That's why I want you
to find the right bride.

188
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:06,083
I'm trying sincerely but I
haven't been able to woo even one.

189
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:10,333
Is she a fish on a bait or
a soap to slip and fall down?

190
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:11,833
I'm talking
of a life partner.

191
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:14,541
I wonder if there is any girl
already born for you!

192
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:17,875
Won't I torture Lord Brahma
if He hasn't created my girl?

193
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:20,500
I am sure a girl is waiting
somewhere just for me, dad.

194
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:38,958
"I found instinctively
what I had lost within me.."

195
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:43,916
"I don't know what to say
even if I want to anyway.."

196
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:48,708
"I found instinctively
what I had lost within me.."

197
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:53,083
"I don't know what to say
even if I want to anyway.."

198
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:58,958
"There's no apt word to spare
in any language to share.."

199
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:03,500
"So how do I tell you
that my feelings are so true?"

200
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:08,250
"In this world
I haven't seen anyone"

201
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:10,666
"with a smile
so unique and genuine."

202
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:13,541
You'll be late for college.
Go and get ready now.

203
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:18,708
"This is not words of praise or flattery.
It's straight from my heart, honestly."

204
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:22,750
"I found instinctively
what I had lost within me."

205
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:29,583
Dad, I'm going to college

206
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:31,666
Okay, my dear. - Okay, bye.
- Bye.

207
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:34,541
Hello, Mr. Ramaraju.

208
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:37,916
Is she your third daughter?

209
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:42,583
Isn't your school a
one co-education? - Yes.

210
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:47,083
"Bid goodbye
to your studies, dear."

211
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:50,333
"Focus on getting
married instead, without fear."

212
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:53,750
No matter how many
songs you sing

213
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:57,833
your wish to chop my ear off
won't get fulfilled.

214
00:13:58,291 --> 00:14:01,333
Because she is my daughter!

215
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:04,250
Let me wait and watch.

216
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:09,083
My legs are aching
waiting for so long.

217
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:11,625
Where is he?
- He has come at last.

218
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,000
Am I late for my bus?
- At what time does the bus with your girl come?

219
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:15,666
8:30 a.m.
- What's the time now?

220
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:18,125
My girl comes in the bus
at 9, I was here at 7:00 a.m.

221
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:19,833
My bus comes at 9:30
but I came at dawn.

222
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:22,791
Even if you spend the whole
night, you'll never get a girl!

223
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:25,166
Why did you come?
- Just like that.

224
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:26,958
When in love, you should
have decoction.

225
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:30,041
That's dedication, you idiot.

226
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,041
Oh no!
- No swearing. - Okay.

227
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:34,416
Hey, my bus is coming.

228
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:39,041
There she is.

229
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:45,250
<i>Ramzan greetings to
my dear brothers and sisters.</i>

230
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:55,958
It's been six months.
- Same shot!

231
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:58,125
I don't know about you,
but I'm really bored.

232
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,958
True.
- I share the same feeling.

233
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:03,041
I've now decided to
give her a love letter.

234
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:05,666
Write it down.
- Done.

235
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:07,125
Go on.

236
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,958
I'm your lover.
You're my flower.

237
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:11,208
Wow!

238
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:14,125
Just buy him a glass of tea
and he'll lick his boots!

239
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,750
Don't feel bad. Will a pig know the scent
of Pond's face powder?

240
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:17,916
Write.
- Yes.

241
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:20,916
I have power.
You are clever.

242
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:22,208
Wow! Wow!

243
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:24,416
Please love me, dear.

244
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:25,958
Our marriage in tower.
- Okay.

245
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:27,833
No..
Eiffel Tower!

246
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:29,083
Wow! Wow!

247
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:32,958
On reading this, the teacher
will fall flat forever.

248
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:34,666
To hand over this
powerful letter

249
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:36,166
I need a positive hand.

250
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:37,458
Mine is a positive hand.

251
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:39,916
You are just the opposite.
- Correct.

252
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:41,708
Hey, positive!

253
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:49,750
I aced my exams.

254
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:51,625
Meow!

255
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:00,375
Yes, you! Come here.
- Come.

256
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:09,708
What is this?
- Love letter.

257
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:12,250
Love letter?
For me?

258
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:14,500
Oh! I won't fall in love
while I'm still a student.

259
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:16,083
I want to become a doctor.

260
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:18,333
If my folks get to know about it,
my dad will kill me.

261
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:21,166
Hey! Stop. Have you ever seen
your face in the mirror?

262
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:24,208
You're still a kid in a skirt
and you want a love letter.

263
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:25,541
Who is the letter for?

264
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:29,500
Take this and give it
to Ms. Sunny.

265
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:33,125
Tell her Raju, M.A, M.Phil.
gave it to her specially. - No.

266
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,583
I don't want
to buy trouble.

267
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:36,250
She'll kill me.

268
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:37,541
For heaven's sake.

269
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:41,250
Hey! Aren't you
Ramaraju's daughter?

270
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:44,375
Yes.
- If you don't give this

271
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:47,666
I'll tell your dad
you asked me for a love letter!

272
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:51,666
When did I ask you?
You just now did! 'Love letter? For me!'

273
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:53,666
Right?
- Yes.

274
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:58,041
Add a smile.

275
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:05,666
Today I am going to talk about
Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet.

276
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:09,208
Today's topic is serendipity!
Give Romeo's letter to Juliet.

277
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:10,750
I won't give.
- Girls!

278
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:12,750
Oh no!
- What's going on?

279
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,875
Nothing, ma'am.
Love letter.

280
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:17,291
Love letter?
Come here.

281
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:31,750
I'm your lover.
You're my flower.

282
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:38,083
I have power.
You are clever.

283
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:43,083
Please marry me, dear.
Our marriage will be in Eiffel Tower!

284
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,625
I'll hit you.

285
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:49,083
Girls shouldn't be
like perfume spray.

286
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:51,708
Boys will want to hit on them then.

287
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:55,791
But like pepper spray
to scare off boys.

288
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:57,208
Okay?

289
00:18:57,875 --> 00:18:59,041
Take me for example.

290
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:02,041
No one has crossed
his limit with me.

291
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:04,166
I'm perfect and proper.

292
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:06,666
This letter isn't
for me, ma'am.

293
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:09,791
But for you!
- For me?

294
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:11,791
Who is that idiot?

295
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:13,791
There he is.

296
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:21,125
Him!

297
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,625
That village boy!
Next time he gives you a love letter

298
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:25,333
use pepper spray on him.

299
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:26,750
Okay, ma'am.
- Go.

300
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,583
I must somehow finish
the assignment.

301
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:30,791
He has seen me. Let's go fast.
- Meow!

302
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:33,458
I don't know
what to tell him.

303
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:34,875
Did you give the letter
to the teacher?

304
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,250
How can I not give
after you asked me to?

305
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:39,291
Showing your
acting skills to me!

306
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:42,416
What did your teacher say?

307
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:45,625
What shall I tell?

308
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:50,083
Come to our school
tomorrow at 8:00 a.m.

309
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:54,333
And if you yell out 'teacher'
with your eyes closed, then..

310
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:55,833
Hold on!

311
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:58,250
If I call out 'teacher'

312
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,000
then she'll come and..

313
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:03,208
Oh, so romantic!

314
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:06,708
You are too young to hear the
rest. Go. Go to mom and dad.

315
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:09,208
Good job.
- All the best.

316
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:10,875
Thanks.

317
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:13,250
Teacher.

318
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:27,958
"Wake up, my dear king.."

319
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:33,375
"Rise and shine with a spring."

320
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,708
"Glam doll's super..
She is a bumper."

321
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:54,166
"Oh dear! I'm going bonkers.."

322
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:59,291
"You are like rice cooked in jaggery..
Your eyes are like hot and spicy pepper."

323
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:01,750
"When you tilt,
you seem like a catapult.."

324
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:06,375
"Wake up, my dear king.."

325
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:10,583
"Rise and shine with a spring.."

326
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:14,166
"Do you want me to
wake you up, my beau?"

327
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:18,083
"Do you want me to get you
out of bed, my true love?"

328
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:21,958
"Sunny.. Sunny! Sunny.. Sunny!
You are my honey, honey, honey.."

329
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:25,833
"Don't tease me to instigate
intimate thoughts in me.."

330
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,750
"Sunny.. Sunny! Sunny.. Sunny!
You are my honey, honey, honey.."

331
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:33,958
"One look at you, my body
swirls into a rapturous rhapsody."

332
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:41,416
"Wake up, my dear.."

333
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:48,791
"Wake up, my dear.."

334
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:56,041
"Like a magnet you attract me,
pulling me towards you."

335
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:59,750
"I whirl in circles crazy
like a giant wheel, I twirl racy."

336
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:03,750
"You're my date chocolaty.
My taste buds await to taste hastily."

337
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:07,291
"Your beauty enamors me
like red ants clamoring."

338
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:13,208
"You jump over the wall, model. In
my dreams, you drill into my heart."

339
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:18,583
"Bottles of beer, pints of whiskey..
Don't make me high and dizzy."

340
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:22,208
"Like the mole on your body
give me an inch of space in your body."

341
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:26,333
"Like atom bomb explosively
you blasted me to hell implosively."

342
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:30,208
"Sunny.. Sunny! Sunny.. Sunny!
You are my honey, honey, honey.."

343
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:34,166
"Don't tease me to instigate
intimate thoughts in me.."

344
00:22:52,041 --> 00:22:53,083
"Come to me my king."

345
00:22:56,541 --> 00:23:00,458
"Oh! You enchantress in a spicy avatar..
Your glance is red hot chili pepper.."

346
00:23:00,583 --> 00:23:04,041
"From head to toe potently,
you stir my feelings perfectly.."

347
00:23:04,166 --> 00:23:08,000
"You flaunt your beauty blatantly
kindling the fire of desire in me."

348
00:23:08,125 --> 00:23:11,708
"Like pressure in a cooker mounting
my heart whistles unhesitating.."

349
00:23:11,875 --> 00:23:17,250
"You've been sculpted from a chunk of
jaggery and wrapped in a sexy silvery foil."

350
00:23:17,375 --> 00:23:23,041
"Immersed in a perfumed river you were
gifted to me on a golden platter.."

351
00:23:23,166 --> 00:23:26,708
"Girl, you drive me crazy
clad in your micro-mini"

352
00:23:26,833 --> 00:23:30,583
"When your brakeless goods train
hits on me, I go breathless.."

353
00:23:30,708 --> 00:23:34,458
"Sunny.. Sunny! Sunny.. Sunny!
You are my honey, honey, honey.."

354
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:38,666
"Don't tease me to instigate
intimate thoughts in me."

355
00:23:44,041 --> 00:23:46,125
"Wake up, my dear.."

356
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,166
"Wake up, my dear.."

357
00:23:53,291 --> 00:23:56,875
"Glam doll's super..
She is a bumper."

358
00:23:57,041 --> 00:23:59,416
"Oh dear! I'm going bonkers.."

359
00:24:00,791 --> 00:24:04,500
"You are like rice cooked in jaggery..
Eyes like hot and spicy pepper."

360
00:24:04,666 --> 00:24:08,541
"You sway swiftly
like a speeding catapult."

361
00:24:08,666 --> 00:24:14,833
"Wake up, my dear king.."

362
00:24:15,041 --> 00:24:20,916
"Rise and shine with a spring.."

363
00:24:24,875 --> 00:24:28,250
Oh, God!
You have no inhibitions!

364
00:24:30,166 --> 00:24:32,333
Why is this dog barking
so early in the morning?

365
00:24:32,791 --> 00:24:34,000
I'll deal with you later.

366
00:24:35,791 --> 00:24:37,750
Julie, don't bark.
It's only me.

367
00:24:39,291 --> 00:24:41,458
You dazzle so colorfully
like a textile shop.

368
00:24:41,708 --> 00:24:42,958
Is it ready-made or
you had it tailored?

369
00:24:43,375 --> 00:24:45,625
You had it tailored.
What's up?

370
00:24:45,791 --> 00:24:47,000
Teacher!

371
00:24:47,541 --> 00:24:48,541
Is her chapter closed?

372
00:24:48,666 --> 00:24:50,083
She has become close.

373
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:52,416
It's the same.
- Go and get ready, man.

374
00:24:52,541 --> 00:24:53,875
Okay, man.
- Go away.

375
00:24:58,125 --> 00:24:59,916
Maybe we've come too early.

376
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:03,500
It's a personal affair.
That's why we are early.

377
00:25:03,625 --> 00:25:08,125
<i>And if you yell out 'teacher'
with your eyes closed, then..</i>

378
00:25:13,375 --> 00:25:15,583
"Sunny.. Sunny! Sunny.. Sunny!"

379
00:25:16,708 --> 00:25:19,875
Teacher!

380
00:25:20,916 --> 00:25:22,916
"Sunny.. Sunny! Sunny.. Sunny!"

381
00:25:24,041 --> 00:25:25,083
Oh, God!
Gorilla!

382
00:25:25,208 --> 00:25:26,750
Gobble him, not me.

383
00:25:27,291 --> 00:25:28,875
She's human.
Not a monkey.

384
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,750
Why did you come when I
called out to the teacher?

385
00:25:31,916 --> 00:25:33,875
Teacher won't come today.
- Why?

386
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,125
It's 2nd of October.
It's a holiday.

387
00:25:37,541 --> 00:25:39,500
I thought only wine shops were
closed on the 2nd of October.

388
00:25:39,625 --> 00:25:41,041
Even schools?
- I know.

389
00:25:41,416 --> 00:25:43,708
Today is 'Gandhi Jayanthi'.
Everything is closed.

390
00:25:44,208 --> 00:25:46,833
I've heard of Gandhi.
But who is Jayanthi?

391
00:25:47,333 --> 00:25:48,708
I think you're Jayanthi, right?

392
00:25:49,041 --> 00:25:50,458
Mad fellow! Doesn't even
know Gandhi's birthday!

393
00:25:50,583 --> 00:25:52,458
Hello, BlueCross! There's a gorilla here.
- Come on.

394
00:25:53,291 --> 00:25:54,833
Hey, Raju! You're just on time.
Come here.

395
00:25:54,958 --> 00:25:56,583
Why, dad?
- What's so urgent?

396
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:58,750
Tie this ox
in our field.

397
00:25:59,166 --> 00:26:00,625
What? With such colorful clothes

398
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:02,500
how can you ask him
to tie this fox?

399
00:26:02,625 --> 00:26:03,666
<i>I'm not a fox, you idiot!</i>

400
00:26:03,791 --> 00:26:05,291
That's an ox.

401
00:26:05,416 --> 00:26:06,625
<i>That's right, rascal.</i>

402
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:08,083
Are they both different?

403
00:26:09,125 --> 00:26:10,375
Okay. Relax!

404
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:12,791
Bank manager wants to
see me immediately.

405
00:26:12,916 --> 00:26:14,500
Just do this for me.

406
00:26:14,625 --> 00:26:16,041
Thanks, see you.
- Hey!

407
00:26:16,291 --> 00:26:17,458
Dad?

408
00:26:20,291 --> 00:26:21,375
Let's go to the field.

409
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,208
Sorry, I don't
befriend animals.

410
00:26:23,375 --> 00:26:25,125
But haven't I done so
for past 20 years?

411
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,625
Are you mocking me
with your beastly dialogs?

412
00:26:30,125 --> 00:26:31,583
Your dad has given
an apt job for you.

413
00:26:31,708 --> 00:26:34,000
If you don't zip your lips
I'll ensure this ox rams into you.

414
00:26:34,875 --> 00:26:36,291
Look at him.

415
00:26:36,541 --> 00:26:38,083
He seems to be
snake-dancing.

416
00:26:39,541 --> 00:26:40,791
Height of stink!

417
00:26:50,125 --> 00:26:51,791
Hello, Raju!

418
00:26:53,833 --> 00:26:55,333
Where are you going
with the ox?

419
00:26:55,458 --> 00:26:57,208
We are going jogging. Want to join?
- Tell me.

420
00:26:57,416 --> 00:26:59,791
His dad has asked him
to tie the ox in his field.

421
00:27:00,166 --> 00:27:01,708
Congratulations!
- Shake hands with him.

422
00:27:01,875 --> 00:27:03,708
Doesn't he have hands?
- What's wrong with my hands?

423
00:27:04,291 --> 00:27:05,291
I'll smack the slipper
across your face.

424
00:27:05,416 --> 00:27:07,500
What did you do now?
- I scratched myself.

425
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:08,958
Before that?
- I relieved myself.

426
00:27:09,125 --> 00:27:10,166
Before that?
- I collected dung.

427
00:27:10,291 --> 00:27:13,125
Oh no!
If you put your hands at odd places

428
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:15,291
they will stink!
- Seems fine to me.

429
00:27:15,416 --> 00:27:17,666
Sanitize your hands for
a week and then meet me.

430
00:27:17,791 --> 00:27:18,916
Move aside.

431
00:27:20,833 --> 00:27:22,625
Greetings, ma'am.
- Jogging?

432
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:24,500
Practicing for team selection.

433
00:27:25,041 --> 00:27:26,875
Congratulations, ma'am.

434
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,500
Congratulations!

435
00:27:29,875 --> 00:27:33,666
All the best.
- Thank you. - Ma'am..

436
00:27:34,041 --> 00:27:36,333
You are making a big mistake, ma'am.
- What happened?

437
00:27:36,458 --> 00:27:40,375
Do you know what he touched,
before he greeted you all over?

438
00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:41,875
Where?

439
00:27:42,333 --> 00:27:43,708
Tell her, man.
- First, he..

440
00:27:46,916 --> 00:27:48,208
What's wrong with that?

441
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:49,833
Congratulations, ma'am.

442
00:27:51,375 --> 00:27:52,708
You!

443
00:27:54,416 --> 00:27:56,833
All the best, ma'am.

444
00:28:00,166 --> 00:28:02,250
It has been a shocking
scenario since morning!

445
00:28:02,375 --> 00:28:04,250
Hey, Raju!
Your courier girl.

446
00:28:06,333 --> 00:28:08,916
I have many questions
to ask her myself.

447
00:28:10,666 --> 00:28:12,750
Hey, meow! You said
the teacher called me.

448
00:28:12,875 --> 00:28:14,041
But the school was closed.

449
00:28:14,166 --> 00:28:17,416
Maybe she forgot that today was a holiday.
How will I know?

450
00:28:17,541 --> 00:28:19,708
Won't you know if your
school is closed or not?

451
00:28:19,916 --> 00:28:24,791
I thought she might call you
to share something personal.

452
00:28:25,708 --> 00:28:27,000
She's a real smart kid.

453
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:28,875
I'll go and call
someone smart.

454
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:31,583
"Oh my beloved.."

455
00:28:32,791 --> 00:28:35,291
Your cow is happily
flirting with my ox.

456
00:28:35,416 --> 00:28:37,583
She's not a cow.
- She's Lakshmi.

457
00:28:37,708 --> 00:28:38,708
Actress Jothilakshmi!

458
00:28:39,791 --> 00:28:41,625
She's our Goddess Lakshmi.

459
00:28:42,083 --> 00:28:44,166
My mother and I
are very fond of her.

460
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:46,666
Your dad loves his gun.

461
00:28:46,791 --> 00:28:48,250
You and your mother
go gaga over a cow.

462
00:28:48,458 --> 00:28:50,541
No one in your family likes
humans, is it?

463
00:28:50,666 --> 00:28:53,083
Yes. Dogs have Blue Cross.
Cows have green grass.

464
00:28:53,208 --> 00:28:54,208
What do human beings have?

465
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:56,041
Cool! We have whiskey in our glass!

466
00:28:57,458 --> 00:29:00,000
Don't talk rubbish!
- Don't talk utter rubbish.

467
00:29:00,125 --> 00:29:01,125
Listen.. Shut up.

468
00:29:01,333 --> 00:29:03,083
You shut up your gob
and everything else also.

469
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:04,583
If you talk ill of my Lakshmi,
I won't keep quiet.

470
00:29:04,708 --> 00:29:06,541
Stop talking in English.
- Stop fighting.

471
00:29:06,708 --> 00:29:08,458
Your bull and cow are
running away together!

472
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:14,291
Ramaraju's cow and
Raju's bull have eloped!

473
00:29:26,875 --> 00:29:29,250
How dare you hit
one of my boys!

474
00:29:33,416 --> 00:29:35,250
He misbehaved.
So I hit him.

475
00:29:35,375 --> 00:29:37,916
That's why I've come
to apologize to you.

476
00:29:38,625 --> 00:29:40,291
Sorry, Kavitha. Forgive me.
- Let go of me.

477
00:29:40,416 --> 00:29:42,541
I'm apologizing
on behalf of him.

478
00:29:42,666 --> 00:29:44,250
I'm sorry.

479
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:46,083
Is it okay to say
'sorry' like this?

480
00:29:46,208 --> 00:29:49,208
Is this what you
call as misbehavior?

481
00:29:50,333 --> 00:29:52,125
What is this?

482
00:29:52,333 --> 00:29:54,125
Don't! This is wrong.

483
00:29:54,291 --> 00:29:55,291
There you go!

484
00:29:59,791 --> 00:30:02,083
Is this how
he misbehaved?

485
00:30:02,208 --> 00:30:04,125
Tell me. Get lost.

486
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:05,791
Don't you try
to run away.

487
00:30:28,416 --> 00:30:31,375
"High voltage wire."

488
00:30:31,541 --> 00:30:35,166
"High voltage wire."

489
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:39,041
I don't want to fight with you
and make this a big issue.

490
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:44,000
So fall at her feet and
beg for her forgiveness.

491
00:30:44,666 --> 00:30:46,958
What will you do
if I don't do so?

492
00:30:50,666 --> 00:30:52,916
<i>After 3 minutes</i>

493
00:30:56,458 --> 00:30:57,791
Seenu?

494
00:31:04,833 --> 00:31:06,875
I'm Seenu and
you dare hit me!

495
00:31:07,041 --> 00:31:10,083
If you have guts
stay right here.

496
00:31:10,208 --> 00:31:12,333
Why do I need guts
to stay right here?

497
00:31:12,458 --> 00:31:13,875
A chair will do.

498
00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:17,083
Ready!

499
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:03,125
You didn't know me or my
brother or my family background

500
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:06,541
but you acted rashly.
This is my reaction.

501
00:32:07,375 --> 00:32:09,833
Don't call out names of
your sister, brother, dad

502
00:32:09,958 --> 00:32:14,458
grandfather, great-grandfather,
neighbor from a voter's list.

503
00:32:15,125 --> 00:32:17,875
I'm not a fruit or a vegetable
to be sold in a market

504
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,416
categorized according
to my seed and roots!

505
00:32:20,791 --> 00:32:22,458
I am a high voltage wire.

506
00:32:22,875 --> 00:32:27,250
Whoever touches me
will receive the same shock!

507
00:32:27,666 --> 00:32:30,500
If you're doubtful
come and touch me.

508
00:33:31,416 --> 00:33:32,750
Thanks.

509
00:33:34,458 --> 00:33:35,958
Next!

510
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:17,750
Kill him!

511
00:35:06,583 --> 00:35:07,666
Go on.

512
00:35:10,958 --> 00:35:12,166
Come on, hit me.

513
00:35:20,833 --> 00:35:22,375
Game over.

514
00:35:36,125 --> 00:35:37,583
Thanks.

515
00:35:51,791 --> 00:35:56,125
If you ever misbehave with not
just my daughter, but any girl

516
00:35:56,375 --> 00:35:57,916
I'll kill you.

517
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,458
Eve-teasing is a common problem
in colleges that girls face.

518
00:36:17,625 --> 00:36:20,000
Best is to find a good groom
and get her married soon.

519
00:36:20,125 --> 00:36:21,208
Very true.

520
00:36:25,666 --> 00:36:26,750
Where's my daughter?

521
00:36:33,541 --> 00:36:34,708
My 2 sons-in-law.

522
00:36:34,833 --> 00:36:36,125
This is the suitor
who is here to see Kavitha.

523
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:37,666
I'll be back.
Keep talking.

524
00:36:37,791 --> 00:36:38,791
Okay.

525
00:36:40,166 --> 00:36:42,000
Look! Here she is.
- Yes.

526
00:36:43,166 --> 00:36:45,083
Looks like a newly built
hi-tech city building.

527
00:36:45,333 --> 00:36:46,625
It's a 'yes' from my end.

528
00:36:47,083 --> 00:36:48,708
Are you coming back from college?
- Yes.

529
00:36:48,916 --> 00:36:50,500
What are you studying?
- 12th grade.

530
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:52,375
Very good.
Study well.

531
00:36:52,583 --> 00:36:53,791
Thank you, uncle.

532
00:36:59,083 --> 00:37:01,041
How could she call me 'uncle'?

533
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:03,125
She doesn't know
that you are the suitor.

534
00:37:03,375 --> 00:37:05,083
Does she know about
the formal meeting?

535
00:37:05,208 --> 00:37:06,916
Doubtful!
- Doubt?

536
00:37:08,791 --> 00:37:10,541
This is an insult to
the software industry.

537
00:37:10,666 --> 00:37:12,208
Why is everybody
so excited and flustered?

538
00:37:12,333 --> 00:37:13,833
That man's who's here to see you
is a suitor.

539
00:37:13,958 --> 00:37:17,625
I want to study.
Please tell dad.

540
00:37:18,958 --> 00:37:20,708
The only thing
I know is to cook.

541
00:37:20,833 --> 00:37:23,000
I even cook
as per your dad's wishes.

542
00:37:23,125 --> 00:37:25,208
So how can I poke
my nose into any alliance?

543
00:37:25,333 --> 00:37:26,291
Go and get ready.

544
00:37:26,416 --> 00:37:27,458
Mother..

545
00:37:27,708 --> 00:37:29,500
Sister, at least you go
and tell him please.

546
00:37:29,791 --> 00:37:31,625
If I were so brave, I'd have
stopped my own wedding!

547
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:35,166
Take this.
- Sister, will you help me?

548
00:37:35,375 --> 00:37:36,833
Coffee is ready.

549
00:37:36,958 --> 00:37:39,333
Get dressed and serve him coffee.

550
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:43,083
None of you need
to talk on my behalf.

551
00:37:43,208 --> 00:37:44,625
I'll handle it myself.

552
00:37:46,208 --> 00:37:47,375
Kavitha!

553
00:37:47,583 --> 00:37:49,916
Mr. Sivarama Raju's third daughter
is engaged to be married

554
00:37:50,041 --> 00:37:54,083
to Venkataraju's eldest son
Prakashraj, as decided by the elders.

555
00:38:02,875 --> 00:38:04,000
May they be happy.

556
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:12,083
Give me tea.

557
00:38:17,833 --> 00:38:20,333
<i>Sivarama Raju's third daughter, Kavitha,
weds Prakashraj on 3rd February, 2014.</i>

558
00:38:20,458 --> 00:38:22,166
Minister, look at that.

559
00:38:25,833 --> 00:38:27,583
She looks familiar.

560
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,333
She's my courier girl, Kavitha!

561
00:38:32,458 --> 00:38:34,625
They are getting
a student married.

562
00:38:35,416 --> 00:38:37,250
If we keep quiet
and not protest

563
00:38:37,375 --> 00:38:39,875
they will resort to
child marriage tomorrow!

564
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:43,500
When situation demands,
we shouldn't postpone our entry.

565
00:38:43,625 --> 00:38:45,750
Start your bullet bike!
- Give me the keys.

566
00:38:46,125 --> 00:38:47,833
Let's go.
- Yes.

567
00:38:49,083 --> 00:38:50,083
Style!

568
00:38:50,208 --> 00:38:51,541
Okay. Let's go.

569
00:38:53,916 --> 00:38:55,000
Yes, sir.

570
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:56,791
No 'sir' is around.
Only we are here.

571
00:38:56,916 --> 00:38:58,500
I meant only you both, sir.

572
00:38:58,625 --> 00:38:59,666
She meant, us.

573
00:38:59,791 --> 00:39:01,916
What's happening
in our town nowadays?

574
00:39:02,208 --> 00:39:03,625
When girls should
be carrying books

575
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:05,583
they are forced to
marry and carry babies!

576
00:39:05,708 --> 00:39:07,041
Even if our society
turns a blind eye to it

577
00:39:07,166 --> 00:39:09,125
our VIP union
will be vocal about it.

578
00:39:10,041 --> 00:39:13,083
Your law specifies that girls should
marry only after they are 18.

579
00:39:13,666 --> 00:39:16,125
But in Mr. Sivarama's
daughter's case

580
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:19,041
your law has
its eyes blindfolded!

581
00:39:19,541 --> 00:39:23,375
Why?
- He's a VIP.

582
00:39:23,958 --> 00:39:26,208
If they sport a big moustache
and roll their dilated eyes

583
00:39:26,333 --> 00:39:27,458
they don't become VIPs.

584
00:39:27,583 --> 00:39:29,583
Cool, boss.
Leave it.

585
00:39:29,875 --> 00:39:31,583
To be cool,
this isn't Ooty.

586
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:33,083
It's my duty.

587
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,916
Don't use fancy words
just to rhyme for effect.

588
00:39:36,416 --> 00:39:38,875
It defines my heartache.

589
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,708
As soon as a girl is 12, so
many do's and don'ts for her.

590
00:39:44,875 --> 00:39:46,125
Don't talk to boys,
or look at them.

591
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:47,958
Learn to cook and
do household chores.

592
00:39:48,125 --> 00:39:49,375
Pray to God every day.

593
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:50,666
Don't step out after 6:00 p.m.

594
00:39:50,791 --> 00:39:52,083
Don't watch TV after 9:00 p.m.

595
00:39:52,291 --> 00:39:53,833
Don't use the cell phone
and talk to anyone.

596
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:55,416
Don't show your face
on Facebook.

597
00:39:55,541 --> 00:39:59,625
Even if married at 17,
don't talk back to elders.

598
00:39:59,833 --> 00:40:02,041
How unfair is this?
Is it right, ma'am?

599
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:04,333
Raju, soda.

600
00:40:04,833 --> 00:40:05,958
Thanks.

601
00:40:13,958 --> 00:40:15,291
Sir..

602
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,375
I'll come to the point.

603
00:40:20,583 --> 00:40:22,583
Will you stop the wedding
of Mr. Sivarama Raju's daughter?

604
00:40:22,708 --> 00:40:25,166
Or shall I report it to
the commissioner?

605
00:40:25,291 --> 00:40:26,666
Come on, tell me.

606
00:40:27,166 --> 00:40:28,791
<i>Kavitha weds Prakashraj.</i>

607
00:40:29,166 --> 00:40:30,291
Welcome.

608
00:40:35,875 --> 00:40:37,625
Don't falter in serving the guests.

609
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:38,708
Okay.

610
00:40:38,833 --> 00:40:42,916
This event should be imprinted
deep in every guest's memory.

611
00:40:43,583 --> 00:40:45,083
Yes, you bet!

612
00:40:45,291 --> 00:40:47,208
Mr. Veeraraju!

613
00:40:47,333 --> 00:40:51,041
You must eat our feast
to your heart's content.

614
00:40:52,166 --> 00:40:53,958
And we've arranged an orchestra

615
00:40:54,208 --> 00:40:56,791
to entertain you with good music.
- Look.

616
00:40:57,083 --> 00:41:00,375
"Rose.. Rose.. Rose..
It's a pretty flower that glows."

617
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:04,791
"It's a pretty flower that glows."

618
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,708
The wedding has been organized
on a real large scale.

619
00:41:06,833 --> 00:41:07,958
Cover our faces.

620
00:41:08,333 --> 00:41:10,083
"Are you the flower?"

621
00:41:10,208 --> 00:41:11,625
Smile, please!
"And the happy shower?"

622
00:41:12,083 --> 00:41:15,916
"Impishness of youth mixed
and song in sync, little minx."

623
00:41:16,041 --> 00:41:18,208
Mr. Veeraraju, God willing
if all goes well, after the wedding

624
00:41:18,333 --> 00:41:21,166
your bet goes for a toss!

625
00:41:21,458 --> 00:41:26,666
"Flash with pomp and splendor.."

626
00:41:26,833 --> 00:41:28,000
You did a great job!

627
00:41:28,125 --> 00:41:29,625
Look, police!

628
00:41:30,125 --> 00:41:33,000
"Come.. Welcome!
Just dazzle me once.."

629
00:41:33,166 --> 00:41:34,250
Come.. Welcome!

630
00:41:34,375 --> 00:41:37,375
"Come.. Welcome!"

631
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,083
Welcome.
- Enough, stop it.

632
00:41:39,208 --> 00:41:42,583
Greetings, sir!
- Why have you come in your uniform?

633
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:44,666
I need to talk to you
for a few minutes, sir.

634
00:41:45,041 --> 00:41:46,166
Come in.

635
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:49,166
Serve mutton.

636
00:41:50,166 --> 00:41:51,708
Why are you
serving me 'sambar'?

637
00:41:51,833 --> 00:41:53,000
We want mutton.

638
00:41:53,166 --> 00:41:55,166
We aren't celebrating Ramzan.

639
00:41:55,291 --> 00:41:57,208
This is Sivarama Raju's
daughter's wedding.

640
00:41:57,333 --> 00:41:59,000
We don't want leaves
that the goat eats.

641
00:41:59,125 --> 00:42:00,208
But the goat itself!

642
00:42:00,333 --> 00:42:01,583
Shut up!
- Serve me 'sambar'.

643
00:42:01,708 --> 00:42:04,875
If you shout too much,
I'll snip off your tail.

644
00:42:05,208 --> 00:42:07,791
As it is, we are tensed about
the arrival of the police.

645
00:42:07,916 --> 00:42:08,916
And you are adding
to our stress.

646
00:42:09,041 --> 00:42:11,083
If you serve us
vegetarian food

647
00:42:11,208 --> 00:42:12,791
do you expect politicians
instead of cops to be your guests?

648
00:42:13,791 --> 00:42:17,000
Just serve them
diluted buttermilk.

649
00:42:18,583 --> 00:42:19,750
Not wrong.

650
00:42:21,041 --> 00:42:22,583
But it is a mistake.

651
00:42:22,833 --> 00:42:25,416
Based on flimsy excuses like
a dog barking or crow cawing

652
00:42:25,541 --> 00:42:28,166
this isn't an ordinary man's
wedding to be stopped suddenly.

653
00:42:28,583 --> 00:42:31,541
Sivarama Raju's family wedding.

654
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:35,666
Sub inspector,
since you're here

655
00:42:35,791 --> 00:42:37,458
bless the couple and
have dinner before you leave.

656
00:42:37,583 --> 00:42:40,750
Your daughter is a minor.
That's the major problem.

657
00:42:43,375 --> 00:42:45,583
If two lovers elope and
come to your station

658
00:42:45,708 --> 00:42:49,750
you'll get them married. Same is
the case in a Registrar's office.

659
00:42:49,958 --> 00:42:52,000
But doesn't a father
have that same right

660
00:42:52,125 --> 00:42:53,083
over his own daughter?

661
00:42:53,208 --> 00:42:55,333
Sir, your daughter
is only 17 years old.

662
00:42:56,375 --> 00:42:58,708
If she's married at 17,
it is a bad decision.

663
00:42:58,833 --> 00:43:01,750
But if it happens when
she's 25, it's approved?

664
00:43:02,125 --> 00:43:03,458
I'll wait for 10 years.

665
00:43:03,875 --> 00:43:05,500
Will you fix
a good alliance?

666
00:43:05,625 --> 00:43:06,708
Tell me.

667
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,208
A complaint has been
registered to stop this wedding.

668
00:43:09,333 --> 00:43:10,666
If you step back yourself,
it'll be good for you.

669
00:43:10,791 --> 00:43:12,625
Or else it will reach
the commissioner's ears.

670
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:14,375
And it will go to
the press and the media.

671
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,250
To the extent of
being arrested, sir.

672
00:43:16,541 --> 00:43:17,625
Please understand.

673
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:25,125
<i>"Stars in the blue sky
only descended for me.."</i>

674
00:43:27,916 --> 00:43:34,291
<i>"Star in the silver studded sky
only descended for me.."</i>

675
00:43:34,583 --> 00:43:35,583
What, sir?

676
00:43:35,708 --> 00:43:37,833
The song selection is superb.

677
00:43:38,041 --> 00:43:41,250
<i>"Here is a moon glowing..
Love in my heart is flowing.."</i>

678
00:43:41,375 --> 00:43:47,958
<i>"When stars and moon don't meet,
how can love and laughter greet?"</i>

679
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:49,458
Stop it!

680
00:43:49,791 --> 00:43:51,708
Listen, everybody!

681
00:43:55,666 --> 00:43:58,541
This wedding is cancelled.

682
00:44:08,166 --> 00:44:10,583
Who was that?

683
00:44:10,708 --> 00:44:12,833
Who whistled?

684
00:44:14,666 --> 00:44:16,291
Sorry, sir.
I'll take leave.

685
00:44:16,416 --> 00:44:21,750
Sub inspector, who filed
the complaint to stop it?

686
00:44:21,875 --> 00:44:24,833
That's confidential! According to our rules,
I can't divulge the name.

687
00:44:24,958 --> 00:44:27,500
Even if you're angry now

688
00:44:27,625 --> 00:44:30,583
later you'll realize that
it all happened for the good.

689
00:44:31,625 --> 00:44:38,791
"Who can foretell
what will happen in the future?"

690
00:44:40,583 --> 00:44:46,750
"Who has guts and gumption
to alter destiny's decision?"

691
00:44:46,875 --> 00:44:48,750
This singer is torturing me.

692
00:44:48,916 --> 00:44:50,458
Double his payment
and send him away.

693
00:44:50,583 --> 00:44:54,583
"Who can foretell
what will happen in the future?"

694
00:44:54,791 --> 00:44:55,875
Sir?

695
00:44:56,250 --> 00:44:58,250
I pin my doubts on Raja.

696
00:44:58,791 --> 00:45:00,666
He only must have
complained.

697
00:45:05,416 --> 00:45:06,416
Greetings, ma'am.
- Greetings.

698
00:45:06,541 --> 00:45:09,041
Well done.
They are getting a minor girl married.

699
00:45:09,208 --> 00:45:14,250
I feel it is Veeraraju
who filed the complaint.

700
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,375
Find out who complained.

701
00:45:25,083 --> 00:45:27,708
I must break
his legs myself.

702
00:45:28,666 --> 00:45:31,333
I thought that my fate
was to get married

703
00:45:31,458 --> 00:45:33,458
wear a sari, raise kids.

704
00:45:34,291 --> 00:45:36,375
I never imagined, I'd
wear my uniform instead

705
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:37,750
and carry books again.

706
00:45:38,625 --> 00:45:39,958
I'm so happy.

707
00:45:40,875 --> 00:45:44,541
In fact, coming back
to studies feels like a dream.

708
00:45:44,666 --> 00:45:46,708
Do you know who made
your dream come true?

709
00:45:47,458 --> 00:45:48,583
Who?

710
00:45:49,041 --> 00:45:51,791
<i>Raju, your complaint worked.
Her wedding was stopped.</i>

711
00:45:51,958 --> 00:45:53,000
<i>Superb!</i>

712
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:55,500
Raju?

713
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:59,083
Come on.
- A fast ball!

714
00:45:59,208 --> 00:46:00,625
He hit it!

715
00:46:01,583 --> 00:46:03,333
Throw the ball.

716
00:46:04,458 --> 00:46:06,666
Hey! Come here.

717
00:46:08,708 --> 00:46:10,750
Why this sudden show
of concern towards me?

718
00:46:10,875 --> 00:46:13,041
Are you trying to hit on me?
- Yuck!

719
00:46:13,166 --> 00:46:16,375
Am I?
- No, you are superb.

720
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:18,708
I heard that you were the one
who stopped my wedding.

721
00:46:18,833 --> 00:46:20,250
I came to thank you.

722
00:46:20,666 --> 00:46:23,666
I stopped your wedding
but don't go about announcing it.

723
00:46:23,791 --> 00:46:25,250
Because basically,
I hate publicity.

724
00:46:25,375 --> 00:46:26,666
That's true.

725
00:46:27,416 --> 00:46:29,625
Shall we come to our
professional matter?

726
00:46:30,416 --> 00:46:31,541
Here.

727
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:38,750
Flowers are for God duly,
Like you are for me only.

728
00:46:39,791 --> 00:46:42,583
Just once, smile for me.
That's our love-melody.

729
00:46:43,041 --> 00:46:44,333
Fantastic!

730
00:46:47,125 --> 00:46:48,416
Why?

731
00:46:48,666 --> 00:46:52,666
When youth the world over fall in love
on Twitter, Whatsapp and Facebook

732
00:46:52,791 --> 00:46:53,958
why are you still
in this love-letter age?

733
00:46:54,083 --> 00:46:57,916
How to work out the chemistry?

734
00:46:58,250 --> 00:47:01,250
Get her chocolates and
a costly greeting card.

735
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:04,166
She'll munch on chocolates
and read your card happily.

736
00:47:04,916 --> 00:47:07,625
Greeting card and Diary milk?
Seems like a costly affair!

737
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:08,750
Raja, take this.

738
00:47:08,875 --> 00:47:11,250
You won't even get
milk for that junk!

739
00:47:45,875 --> 00:47:49,916
"I was a naive teenager,
more like a kid."

740
00:47:50,083 --> 00:47:54,083
"Your glance hit on me,
to a halt I skid."

741
00:47:54,458 --> 00:48:02,708
"I was unconcerned adolescent and bubbly
until your dreams awakened me rudely."

742
00:48:02,833 --> 00:48:07,166
"What has happened to me?
I have no clue exactly."

743
00:48:07,291 --> 00:48:11,500
"What happened to my mindset after
I met you for the first time?"

744
00:48:11,708 --> 00:48:20,083
"Hey! I fell hook, line and sinker...
Warm fuzzy feeling spreads all over.."

745
00:48:20,291 --> 00:48:29,208
"I've fallen flat for you, my beau...
It has transformed me like you."

746
00:48:54,875 --> 00:49:03,458
"Not just Telugu, I looked up for the name
of this disease in other dictionaries too."

747
00:49:03,583 --> 00:49:12,041
"In this world, only you can explain aptly
because you're the reason for this new me."

748
00:49:12,333 --> 00:49:20,375
"Though I lost weight with great difficulty,
my heart still stubbornly feels heavy."

749
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:29,125
"Hey! I fell hook, line and sinker..
Warm fuzzy feeling spreads all over."

750
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:37,708
"I've fallen flat for you, my beau..
It has transformed me like you."

751
00:49:55,500 --> 00:50:03,708
"Studies don't worry me
as I'm ready to study you."

752
00:50:03,833 --> 00:50:12,375
"I care to hoots about tomorrow in the
joy I got in forgetting yesterday."

753
00:50:12,708 --> 00:50:20,791
"Consumed in your thoughts, I bid farewell
to my parents who yell and friends swell."

754
00:50:20,916 --> 00:50:29,458
"Hey! I fell hook, line and sinker..
Warm fuzzy feeling spreads all over."

755
00:50:29,625 --> 00:50:38,416
"I've fallen flat for you, my beau..
It has transformed me like you."

756
00:50:41,416 --> 00:50:42,541
Meow!

757
00:50:45,791 --> 00:50:47,458
Give this to your teacher.

758
00:50:47,875 --> 00:50:49,750
What's this?
- Ribbon.

759
00:50:49,958 --> 00:50:51,166
Ribbon?

760
00:50:52,083 --> 00:50:53,916
Her complexion
and smile are okay.

761
00:50:54,041 --> 00:50:56,875
But she leaves her hair loose
like some frightful spirit.

762
00:50:57,208 --> 00:50:58,750
Even if she's an expert
English teacher

763
00:50:58,875 --> 00:51:01,041
I prefer a girl who has
imbibed Telugu culture.

764
00:51:01,375 --> 00:51:04,666
If she plaits her hair
and ties a ribbon..

765
00:51:06,166 --> 00:51:11,958
"A girl with the sideways glance
who moves like a swan, please wait."

766
00:51:12,250 --> 00:51:15,833
Very old.
- Just do as I say.

767
00:51:16,958 --> 00:51:18,083
Go.

768
00:51:20,458 --> 00:51:22,916
You must fall in love, dude.
Otherwise, life is a waste.

769
00:51:23,041 --> 00:51:25,333
Meow! You came here
without me calling you.

770
00:51:25,458 --> 00:51:27,041
Anyway, you'll call me.

771
00:51:27,166 --> 00:51:28,416
Super!

772
00:51:30,916 --> 00:51:32,250
What is this? Wedding card.

773
00:51:32,375 --> 00:51:33,458
Are you getting married?

774
00:51:33,583 --> 00:51:35,041
Not me.

775
00:51:35,791 --> 00:51:37,166
Sunny ma'am.

776
00:51:39,541 --> 00:51:41,375
Is Sunny ma'am getting married?

777
00:51:42,875 --> 00:51:48,666
"It's time to say bye."

778
00:51:49,416 --> 00:51:53,166
"This is destiny."

779
00:51:54,375 --> 00:52:00,041
"It's time to say bye
to our love."

780
00:52:00,833 --> 00:52:01,833
"This is destiny."

781
00:52:01,958 --> 00:52:03,708
You look at me
and smile every day.

782
00:52:04,208 --> 00:52:05,666
Finally, you gave me
this wedding invite!

783
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:07,375
Why?

784
00:52:07,583 --> 00:52:12,625
I did not smile at you
but at your pose in the posters.

785
00:52:14,041 --> 00:52:16,166
You must attend
my wedding.

786
00:52:17,916 --> 00:52:22,625
Who is that super man who is
marrying this super personality?

787
00:52:26,666 --> 00:52:28,916
"Shambu.. Shambu.. Shambu.."

788
00:52:29,083 --> 00:52:32,041
"Shambu.. Shambu.. Shambu.."

789
00:52:32,291 --> 00:52:35,833
"Shambu.. Shambu.. Shambu.."

790
00:52:35,958 --> 00:52:42,458
If courage gets scared, it will place
my picture under its pillow and sleep.

791
00:52:42,583 --> 00:52:44,250
What if the girls get scared?

792
00:52:44,583 --> 00:52:46,791
They'll use me
as their pillow!

793
00:52:47,666 --> 00:52:50,916
It's my way or the highway!

794
00:52:51,666 --> 00:52:53,666
Come on, Sunny!

795
00:52:56,166 --> 00:52:58,416
Superb.
- Thanks.

796
00:52:59,875 --> 00:53:01,958
"Shambu.. Shambu.. Shambu.."

797
00:53:02,083 --> 00:53:04,375
"Shambu.. Shambu.. Shambu.."

798
00:53:04,833 --> 00:53:06,000
Bye.

799
00:53:06,125 --> 00:53:09,083
"Shambu.. Shambu.. Shambu.."

800
00:53:09,625 --> 00:53:11,250
Horrible combination!

801
00:53:11,666 --> 00:53:12,708
Bye.

802
00:53:13,166 --> 00:53:15,875
Are you feeling sad
since the teacher ditched you?

803
00:53:16,125 --> 00:53:18,750
Don't be silly.
The youth has changed now.

804
00:53:18,875 --> 00:53:22,000
No one drinks these days
because they get dumped.

805
00:53:22,125 --> 00:53:24,500
They drink only because they are
wondering how to woo the next girl!

806
00:53:24,625 --> 00:53:26,291
Is it?
- The trend has changed.

807
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:28,750
Then why do I see
tears in your eyes?

808
00:53:28,875 --> 00:53:32,833
Even if I don't get her, it's okay
but just imagine. She fell for him!

809
00:53:32,958 --> 00:53:34,333
Let that go.

810
00:53:34,458 --> 00:53:36,958
The elders have convened
a meeting about our temple festival.

811
00:53:37,083 --> 00:53:38,083
Let's go and see.

812
00:53:38,333 --> 00:53:40,916
Are they meeting without
the VIP union's knowledge?

813
00:53:41,041 --> 00:53:43,000
Hey!
Let's go right away.

814
00:53:43,291 --> 00:53:44,500
VIP union!

815
00:53:46,708 --> 00:53:48,750
Have you sprained your back, sir?
- No way.

816
00:53:48,875 --> 00:53:51,000
You'll never catch him spraining
his back. He's an iron man!

817
00:53:51,125 --> 00:53:52,750
Start, sir.

818
00:53:52,916 --> 00:53:55,583
Just like all the previous years,
this year also, we should

819
00:53:55,708 --> 00:53:57,833
conduct this festival
in a grand manner.

820
00:53:57,958 --> 00:54:01,000
If every family contributes
their share, we'll take care

821
00:54:01,166 --> 00:54:02,416
of the remaining expenses.

822
00:54:02,541 --> 00:54:04,833
Decorating the idol,
chariot procession

823
00:54:04,958 --> 00:54:07,166
special prayers,
devotional songs

824
00:54:07,291 --> 00:54:10,583
spiritual lectures,
stories of mythology.

825
00:54:10,708 --> 00:54:12,458
Everything will be scheduled
like we do every year, okay?

826
00:54:12,583 --> 00:54:14,125
This is more than enough
for our people.

827
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:15,208
Go.

828
00:54:15,333 --> 00:54:16,916
Wait!

829
00:54:17,333 --> 00:54:20,666
How can you suggest and
accept your ideas?

830
00:54:20,875 --> 00:54:22,666
Shouldn't you know
what the youngsters think?

831
00:54:22,791 --> 00:54:25,791
Youth?
Who else is more youthful than us?

832
00:54:27,541 --> 00:54:31,291
"Let me check!
We are.. VIP!"

833
00:54:31,666 --> 00:54:33,166
"Here we go!"

834
00:54:35,208 --> 00:54:39,250
"VIP! Here we go!"

835
00:54:39,375 --> 00:54:41,916
If this town is the jungle,
our sir is the.. - Lion.

836
00:54:42,125 --> 00:54:44,375
If it comes to hunting, sir is..
- A tiger!

837
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:47,291
If it's a race sir is..
- A horse.

838
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:48,791
Why compare me to animals?

839
00:54:48,916 --> 00:54:50,916
There's enough
controversy about this.

840
00:54:51,041 --> 00:54:53,750
Catch! - Okay. - My dear
old men from the village.

841
00:54:53,875 --> 00:54:55,250
They won't understand English.

842
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:56,875
My dear village friends.. - Yes.
- You've been organizing

843
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,041
this temple festival
the way you wanted all along.

844
00:54:59,458 --> 00:55:01,833
Hereafter, it cannot
h-happen like that.

845
00:55:01,958 --> 00:55:03,666
People say that he will take over the
leadership of this village after you.

846
00:55:03,791 --> 00:55:07,583
"Here now!
VIP! VIP!"

847
00:55:07,708 --> 00:55:09,750
"Here we go."

848
00:55:11,083 --> 00:55:15,375
"VIP! VIP!
Here we go."

849
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:18,125
After our sir has decided,
there's no room for discussion.

850
00:55:18,458 --> 00:55:21,291
If accompaniments don't shut up,
all instruments will be smashed.

851
00:55:21,416 --> 00:55:22,416
What?

852
00:55:22,541 --> 00:55:24,625
How dare he!

853
00:55:27,416 --> 00:55:30,083
Stop!
- Stop it!

854
00:55:32,041 --> 00:55:33,916
What is it that you boys want?

855
00:55:34,041 --> 00:55:38,041
Our neighboring village is small,
still it organized a record dance.

856
00:55:38,166 --> 00:55:41,291
We spoke about Rita's record dance
last month in Modhugapalyam

857
00:55:41,416 --> 00:55:43,000
for a whole week.

858
00:55:43,666 --> 00:55:47,833
To watch such a performance, we
have to go from village to village.

859
00:55:48,666 --> 00:55:52,458
If you don't organize
Rita's record dance this year

860
00:55:52,708 --> 00:55:56,791
I have no option other than
leaving this home town of mine.

861
00:55:56,958 --> 00:55:57,958
Raju!

862
00:55:58,083 --> 00:56:00,208
Our town without you will be
like a temple without a God.

863
00:56:00,333 --> 00:56:02,666
God-less temple!
- How's it possible?

864
00:56:02,791 --> 00:56:04,000
Stop it!

865
00:56:04,291 --> 00:56:05,375
Tell us what you want.

866
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:08,750
If people can enjoy
watching a film for 2 hours

867
00:56:08,875 --> 00:56:11,958
is it wrong to wish for entertainment
in our temple festival for 3 days?

868
00:56:12,125 --> 00:56:14,708
Am I asking Rita
to take her home with me?

869
00:56:14,958 --> 00:56:15,958
No. Never!

870
00:56:16,125 --> 00:56:18,291
For that elderly gentleman..

871
00:56:18,916 --> 00:56:20,541
For that little boy..

872
00:56:20,666 --> 00:56:22,375
For that old man..

873
00:56:22,666 --> 00:56:26,833
Along with all religious talks
and stories, Rita should dance

874
00:56:27,125 --> 00:56:31,625
to sexy siren
Silk Smitha's songs.

875
00:56:32,625 --> 00:56:34,000
Why late?
- Don't you want it?

876
00:56:34,166 --> 00:56:35,750
Of course, I do.

877
00:56:35,875 --> 00:56:37,208
Rita's dance must be
compulsory.

878
00:56:37,333 --> 00:56:40,041
"Dance with me, fiance..
- Dance with me, fiance.."

879
00:56:40,166 --> 00:56:43,583
"Swing with me, fiance..
- Swing with me, fiance.."

880
00:56:49,875 --> 00:56:52,750
"Dance with me, fiance..
- Dance with me, fiance.."

881
00:56:52,875 --> 00:56:56,041
"Swing with me, fiance.."
- "Swing with me, fiance.."

882
00:56:56,250 --> 00:56:59,250
"Hanuman who carried
the mountain."

883
00:56:59,375 --> 00:57:02,750
"Devotee of Lord Rama,
he's known for his strength."

884
00:57:02,875 --> 00:57:06,916
"Listen to this story
of valor and victory."

885
00:57:07,083 --> 00:57:08,583
"Heavenly damsel Menaka
also liked him.."

886
00:57:08,708 --> 00:57:16,666
"Oh Subba Rao, Appa Rao,
Venkat Rao, Ranga Rao.."

887
00:57:16,791 --> 00:57:24,375
"Oh Subba Rao, Appa Rao,
Venkat Rao, Ranga Rao.."

888
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:29,958
"I thought one of them will come.
But you came instead, Mr. Handsome."

889
00:57:30,083 --> 00:57:34,500
"For you, I'm ready.."

890
00:57:34,625 --> 00:57:36,625
I'll be back.

891
00:57:38,083 --> 00:57:40,625
Rita was ravishing.
- Then stay behind!

892
00:58:04,458 --> 00:58:06,458
Where is Kavitha?
- She must be around somewhere.

893
00:58:06,583 --> 00:58:07,666
Hey, Kavitha.

894
00:58:31,666 --> 00:58:33,041
Hold him.

895
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,291
Why are you
so shocked?

896
00:58:43,416 --> 00:58:45,625
When the girl I love is
right before my eyes

897
00:58:45,958 --> 00:58:47,666
I was looking
all over the place for her.

898
00:58:49,833 --> 00:58:52,083
I didn't look at her twice
when she was in her uniform.

899
00:58:52,708 --> 00:58:56,416
In a sari, my God!
I can build a temple for her!

900
00:58:56,541 --> 00:58:57,791
Temple?

901
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,625
In my heart!

902
00:59:02,666 --> 00:59:04,666
If her father gets to know
your present feelings

903
00:59:04,791 --> 00:59:07,250
he will shoot you
with his double barrel gun!

904
00:59:12,458 --> 00:59:15,958
"My heartbeat escalated suddenly.
Some hullabaloo whirling within me."

905
00:59:16,083 --> 00:59:19,458
"Earth stopped rotating on its axis.
And the wind became static.."

906
00:59:19,583 --> 00:59:22,958
"A new seed germinated in my mind..
My masculinity did unwind.."

907
00:59:23,083 --> 00:59:28,000
"Every nerve stimulated afresh..
Till yesterday, no such adrenalin rush.."

908
00:59:28,375 --> 00:59:31,958
"Thousands of meteors
in my heart thundered.."

909
00:59:32,166 --> 00:59:39,041
"Like lightning zillion
swords plundered."

910
00:59:42,625 --> 00:59:46,083
"Even the land under my feet
deserted me completely.."

911
00:59:46,208 --> 00:59:49,666
"Though my soul feels squeezed out,
it is a pleasurable pain no doubt."

912
00:59:49,791 --> 00:59:53,208
"Before my eyes could blink,
what's up, do you think?"

913
00:59:53,375 --> 00:59:56,833
"In a split second, I've
lost my senses to a new me."

914
00:59:56,958 --> 01:00:00,416
"O' girl, my damsel dear..
You sparkled in my gaze clear.."

915
01:00:00,541 --> 01:00:03,916
"O' girl, precious maiden..
In my breath, you are woven."

916
01:00:04,041 --> 01:00:09,625
"Princess, you've now turned
into a Goddess, good Lord!"

917
01:00:18,208 --> 01:00:25,291
"Were you molded from mercury
as your body glows glitzy?"

918
01:00:25,416 --> 01:00:32,666
"With floral fragrance were you laced
and sent on to my scent in haste?"

919
01:00:33,125 --> 01:00:40,083
"I wonder if the 7 wonders of the world
made a beeline for you with joy untold."

920
01:00:40,250 --> 01:00:46,583
"Mind can never go amiss..
Nothing compares to you, miss."

921
01:00:46,708 --> 01:00:50,083
"Girl, my dear beloved.. You
knocked the doors of my heart."

922
01:00:50,208 --> 01:00:53,666
"Lass, oh my treasure trove..
You hold the pulse to my love."

923
01:00:53,791 --> 01:00:59,250
"Little woman, in my dream divine,
you lit a lamp to shine sublime.."

924
01:01:32,791 --> 01:01:39,708
"In a whirlwind like a peacock feather..
Floats my heart in anticipation in midair."

925
01:01:39,916 --> 01:01:47,166
"In a cyclone, my conscience spreads
like a rainbow in 7 colorful ways.."

926
01:01:47,750 --> 01:01:54,791
"Your youth glistens like gold, you'll be,
my child-woman, always in my memory.."

927
01:01:54,916 --> 01:02:01,250
"You've etched your picture
as this birth's souvenir."

928
01:02:01,375 --> 01:02:04,791
"Girl, my love, you stepped
into my world, my heart leapt.."

929
01:02:04,916 --> 01:02:08,291
"Oh, girl.. You captivated me
with your charm and beauty."

930
01:02:08,416 --> 01:02:13,666
"Girl, my ideal deity..
You were born just for me."

931
01:02:15,541 --> 01:02:18,958
"Oh damsel who bedazzles me.
Your beauty plunders me."

932
01:02:19,083 --> 01:02:22,541
"Girl, I'm so love-struck, sweetie..
I surrender to you completely."

933
01:02:22,666 --> 01:02:28,083
"Girl, I'm helpless, honey.
I'm falling for you, God help me."

934
01:02:52,750 --> 01:02:53,666
Good morning, sir.

935
01:02:53,791 --> 01:02:55,500
Hello.
- Go inside, dear. You've come home..

936
01:02:55,625 --> 01:02:58,125
Take it.
- Why all this, sir?

937
01:02:58,541 --> 01:03:00,083
In my entire lifetime
I'll never forget

938
01:03:00,250 --> 01:03:01,833
the favor you did
for me the other day.

939
01:03:01,958 --> 01:03:03,333
What did I do, sir?

940
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,666
My daughter has aced her studies.
- Really!

941
01:03:06,791 --> 01:03:08,625
If you hadn't stopped
the wedding that day

942
01:03:08,750 --> 01:03:10,333
I wouldn't be
so happy today!

943
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:12,416
Sir, your daughter
is 18 and a major now.

944
01:03:12,541 --> 01:03:14,291
You can get her married to
the man of her choice.

945
01:03:14,416 --> 01:03:17,333
Thanks a lot.
- Please don't thank me. Thank Raju.

946
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:19,000
Raju!
- Raju?

947
01:03:19,166 --> 01:03:20,833
Our presi..
- No one else but the president

948
01:03:20,958 --> 01:03:24,208
of the youth VIP union.

949
01:03:24,333 --> 01:03:25,750
That boy!

950
01:03:25,875 --> 01:03:27,166
Yes, that boy.

951
01:03:28,041 --> 01:03:30,166
He has been doing some
good deeds in our society.

952
01:03:30,375 --> 01:03:32,000
This is one of them.
That's good.

953
01:03:32,125 --> 01:03:33,291
Okay, sir.

954
01:03:37,791 --> 01:03:39,625
Sir, we should beat him
to a pulp right away.

955
01:03:39,791 --> 01:03:41,250
Yes, sir.

956
01:03:41,583 --> 01:03:43,250
Raju!

957
01:03:57,625 --> 01:03:58,833
Meow!

958
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:06,500
Heart attack!

959
01:04:06,750 --> 01:04:09,125
I mean love.
- Okay.

960
01:04:09,291 --> 01:04:10,458
What?

961
01:04:32,750 --> 01:04:37,125
Siva sir, the rat is acting up
in front of the elephant.

962
01:04:37,250 --> 01:04:39,375
We must snip its tail off!

963
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:42,083
One look at him, my temper
reaches boiling point, sir.

964
01:05:47,750 --> 01:05:49,291
Caught him!

965
01:05:51,166 --> 01:05:52,500
Sir, I love you.

966
01:05:52,708 --> 01:05:54,791
It means,
I love you.

967
01:05:54,916 --> 01:05:57,333
Ma'am, do you love me?

968
01:05:57,541 --> 01:05:59,958
Hey!

969
01:06:00,416 --> 01:06:02,833
It has been proclaimed
that we should love all beings.

970
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,625
By Allah, Jesus, Vishnu..

971
01:06:05,791 --> 01:06:08,416
Even Mahatma Gandhi has
spread the same message.

972
01:06:09,208 --> 01:06:12,916
It is the agenda of our VIP union
to spread this message of love.

973
01:06:14,416 --> 01:06:15,583
I'll go. You continue.

974
01:06:16,541 --> 01:06:22,250
Hey, Mr. Veeraraju! You should also
follow this instead of chopping ears.

975
01:06:22,375 --> 01:06:24,041
I love you.
You love me. Okay!

976
01:06:24,166 --> 01:06:25,875
I love you, sir.

977
01:06:26,333 --> 01:06:28,541
Thank God!
That was a close shave.

978
01:06:28,666 --> 01:06:30,166
Great escape, dude.

979
01:06:30,291 --> 01:06:32,083
Let's scoot from here.

980
01:06:32,208 --> 01:06:35,125
He wants us to love all.

981
01:06:35,250 --> 01:06:38,041
You thought that he was
in love with your daughter.

982
01:06:38,416 --> 01:06:42,083
Raju who complained and
stopped my daughter's wedding

983
01:06:42,375 --> 01:06:44,333
shouldn't be
sitting on a bike.

984
01:06:44,958 --> 01:06:46,875
He should be sitting
in a wheel chair!

985
01:06:55,666 --> 01:06:59,958
"High voltage wire."

986
01:07:02,875 --> 01:07:04,375
Go forward.

987
01:07:20,125 --> 01:07:21,958
Why should you be
scared and reverse?

988
01:07:22,125 --> 01:07:23,666
I was scared of
fighting with him.

989
01:07:23,791 --> 01:07:24,916
So I didn't move.

990
01:07:25,125 --> 01:07:28,125
We shouldn't get scared.
We should scare them.

991
01:07:29,458 --> 01:07:34,250
I'll teach Raju to
be scared of death!

992
01:07:39,375 --> 01:07:40,791
Just watch.
He'll call me.

993
01:07:40,916 --> 01:07:41,958
Meow!

994
01:07:42,083 --> 01:07:44,083
Why are you in my area?
To see me?

995
01:07:44,208 --> 01:07:47,208
No, for Kishore's sake.
- Oh no!

996
01:07:47,708 --> 01:07:49,625
Shall I try my luck?

997
01:07:49,750 --> 01:07:51,208
Okay, I'll support you.

998
01:07:51,333 --> 01:07:53,125
Uncle, give me
2 chocolate bars.

999
01:07:53,250 --> 01:07:54,750
Isn't this design beautiful?

1000
01:07:54,875 --> 01:07:56,333
Lovely.
- Nice.

1001
01:07:59,958 --> 01:08:02,791
Take this.
It's really beautiful.

1002
01:08:04,250 --> 01:08:05,708
No need.

1003
01:08:07,416 --> 01:08:09,791
Brushing my male ego aside,
I must tell you

1004
01:08:10,250 --> 01:08:11,708
I've fallen
in love with you.

1005
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:15,583
I haven't.

1006
01:08:16,333 --> 01:08:18,708
If not today, for sure
you'll fall for me someday.

1007
01:08:19,375 --> 01:08:20,666
You don't have
any other option.

1008
01:08:21,041 --> 01:08:22,041
Why?

1009
01:08:22,166 --> 01:08:27,541
Because I saw your mole
which no one else has seen!

1010
01:08:28,958 --> 01:08:30,041
Where?

1011
01:08:30,666 --> 01:08:32,291
I won't tell you.
- Tell me, please tell me.

1012
01:08:33,083 --> 01:08:35,041
I'll tell you
after we get married.

1013
01:08:35,541 --> 01:08:37,041
Marriage?

1014
01:08:37,333 --> 01:08:38,416
All the best.

1015
01:08:38,541 --> 01:08:40,083
Thanks.
- Thanks to you too.

1016
01:08:40,625 --> 01:08:43,541
Raju, my prince.
Please come.

1017
01:08:43,875 --> 01:08:45,875
You love Raju,
don't you?

1018
01:08:47,208 --> 01:08:49,041
Why don't you
tell him then?

1019
01:08:49,416 --> 01:08:50,708
I will.

1020
01:08:51,250 --> 01:08:56,250
When I know that he'll do anything
for our love, I'll tell him.

1021
01:09:12,250 --> 01:09:17,833
If you poke your nose
in matters that don't concern you

1022
01:09:17,958 --> 01:09:19,458
you'll lose your head.

1023
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:27,458
Sir, people claim if I hit,
it will be a total knock out!

1024
01:09:28,833 --> 01:09:31,041
I'm warning you
for your own good.

1025
01:09:31,333 --> 01:09:33,083
<i>Alcohol consumption
is injurious to health.</i>

1026
01:09:33,791 --> 01:09:35,041
<i>Alcohol consumption
is injurious to health.</i>

1027
01:09:35,166 --> 01:09:36,125
<i>Alcohol consumption
is injurious to health.</i>

1028
01:09:37,375 --> 01:09:41,416
If you apologize for what you did,
you can leave without a scratch.

1029
01:09:41,541 --> 01:09:43,416
I'll ignore your misdeeds.

1030
01:09:43,541 --> 01:09:44,958
What if I don't?

1031
01:09:45,625 --> 01:09:50,541
<i>Alcohol consumption
is injurious to health.</i>

1032
01:11:54,083 --> 01:11:56,416
Who is hitting
one of our men?

1033
01:11:57,916 --> 01:11:59,875
Stop!

1034
01:12:03,125 --> 01:12:04,708
Who is that?

1035
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,583
Isn't it Chandra's son?

1036
01:12:08,708 --> 01:12:10,916
Yes, it's him.
- Lift.. Lift him.

1037
01:12:18,208 --> 01:12:20,083
What happened?

1038
01:12:20,833 --> 01:12:21,916
What happened, sir?

1039
01:12:22,041 --> 01:12:25,125
I heard that your son is as powerful
as an electric wire.

1040
01:12:27,541 --> 01:12:30,708
But the shock treatment
went to your son

1041
01:12:31,125 --> 01:12:33,083
instead of the person
it was intended for.

1042
01:12:35,041 --> 01:12:38,750
Chandra, what's right for your son

1043
01:12:39,125 --> 01:12:40,958
seems wrong for the opponent.

1044
01:12:45,416 --> 01:12:47,416
He interferes unnecessarily.

1045
01:12:48,416 --> 01:12:51,208
What if they kill him?

1046
01:12:53,375 --> 01:12:56,666
I can't come every time like
Lord Krishna and save him, right?

1047
01:13:02,875 --> 01:13:05,916
Between 2 men,
there is a line.

1048
01:13:06,958 --> 01:13:10,041
As long as the line isn't crossed,
there won't be any problem.

1049
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:14,875
Even Goddess Sita couldn't avert
disaster when she crossed that line.

1050
01:13:15,375 --> 01:13:16,875
You're just a small fly.

1051
01:13:19,875 --> 01:13:21,333
Be careful.

1052
01:13:26,833 --> 01:13:27,916
Why are you advising him?

1053
01:13:28,041 --> 01:13:29,791
You should have
killed him straight away.

1054
01:13:29,916 --> 01:13:32,458
We had him beaten up.
We warned him also.

1055
01:13:32,875 --> 01:13:33,958
If he still doesn't listen

1056
01:13:34,125 --> 01:13:36,250
we'll have to resort
to what you say.

1057
01:13:37,666 --> 01:13:39,375
There's a time for that too.

1058
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:41,041
Who instigated this?

1059
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:43,208
This big shot
who left just now.

1060
01:13:43,333 --> 01:13:44,666
What are you saying?!

1061
01:13:44,791 --> 01:13:46,791
He was getting
his minor daughter married.

1062
01:13:46,916 --> 01:13:48,458
I complained to the police
and stopped the wedding.

1063
01:13:48,666 --> 01:13:52,708
So he got me thrashed.
- You called him a big shot!

1064
01:13:52,916 --> 01:13:54,958
He's a narrow minded man.

1065
01:13:56,958 --> 01:13:58,875
Why are you hesitating?

1066
01:13:59,625 --> 01:14:00,708
Just go and kill him.

1067
01:14:02,583 --> 01:14:05,333
How to jump
this high wall?

1068
01:14:06,583 --> 01:14:07,958
It's me.

1069
01:14:08,625 --> 01:14:10,708
No one saw us.

1070
01:14:13,041 --> 01:14:14,958
Oh, God! Lord Vinayaka,
how are you?

1071
01:14:17,291 --> 01:14:20,791
Sivarama Raju's life
is on that wall.

1072
01:14:31,291 --> 01:14:32,666
Catch!

1073
01:14:34,541 --> 01:14:35,875
Oh! It didn't fall.

1074
01:14:46,416 --> 01:14:49,333
Can't see his moustache.
I'll flash the light on him.

1075
01:14:49,875 --> 01:14:53,000
Shoot him now.
Oh! He's waking up.

1076
01:14:58,958 --> 01:15:01,583
If he had woken up,
we'd be dead meat.

1077
01:15:24,916 --> 01:15:26,375
Trickster!

1078
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:29,416
You refused and then used
the same henna design.

1079
01:15:29,541 --> 01:15:30,958
Naughty girl!

1080
01:15:37,083 --> 01:15:38,458
Shall I kiss you or not?

1081
01:15:41,166 --> 01:15:42,708
My property, right?

1082
01:15:47,041 --> 01:15:48,208
Good God!

1083
01:15:50,208 --> 01:15:51,333
Okay, do this.

1084
01:15:51,458 --> 01:15:54,250
I've never seen anything
like this in person before.

1085
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:55,666
I'll switch on the light.

1086
01:15:55,791 --> 01:15:57,125
Carry on.

1087
01:15:57,500 --> 01:15:58,875
Sorry.

1088
01:15:59,458 --> 01:16:00,500
Wait for me.

1089
01:16:14,583 --> 01:16:17,750
Parvathy.. Parvathy?

1090
01:16:17,875 --> 01:16:20,250
What, dear?
- Where's my gun?

1091
01:16:22,291 --> 01:16:23,416
How will I know?

1092
01:16:23,541 --> 01:16:26,250
It was on the wall last night
but is missing in the morning!

1093
01:16:26,375 --> 01:16:28,541
Kavitha.. Kavitha?

1094
01:16:29,375 --> 01:16:32,041
What, father?
- Did you see my gun?

1095
01:16:32,250 --> 01:16:33,750
I did.

1096
01:16:34,041 --> 01:16:37,708
Gun as in the dubbed film?
It's a super duper film.

1097
01:16:38,625 --> 01:16:41,541
What happened?
- His gun is missing.

1098
01:16:41,958 --> 01:16:43,375
Gone?

1099
01:16:43,958 --> 01:16:46,583
Where is my gun?

1100
01:16:53,958 --> 01:16:55,291
What will I do
without my gun?

1101
01:16:55,416 --> 01:16:56,458
Someone has stolen it..

1102
01:16:56,583 --> 01:16:58,666
Why worry about
a rusty old gun?

1103
01:16:58,791 --> 01:17:00,041
Forget it.

1104
01:17:00,166 --> 01:17:03,916
Your brain is rusted.
How dare you deride my gun!

1105
01:17:04,125 --> 01:17:06,250
No one is bothered
about my gun.

1106
01:17:06,375 --> 01:17:08,833
Wonder whose hands
my poor child is stuck in?

1107
01:17:08,958 --> 01:17:10,916
And what suffering
it is going through!

1108
01:17:14,666 --> 01:17:17,333
Bravo!
Shoot below now.

1109
01:17:23,333 --> 01:17:25,750
My gun is missing, why should
this picture be hanging here?

1110
01:17:25,875 --> 01:17:27,208
Don't break it.

1111
01:17:27,416 --> 01:17:30,208
Do you love me so much?

1112
01:17:30,333 --> 01:17:31,458
No, dear.

1113
01:17:31,583 --> 01:17:33,625
I just now swept
the house clean.

1114
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,958
My blessed fate!
- Sir.. Sir?

1115
01:17:38,083 --> 01:17:40,333
Even if our best friend
puts the towel on his head

1116
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:42,875
instead of his shoulders
he has such a distinct style!

1117
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,916
Not only that, the whole town
will now imitate this style.

1118
01:17:46,041 --> 01:17:50,541
Delicious smell of mutton curry
is giving me hunger pangs.

1119
01:17:50,875 --> 01:17:52,958
Did you go hunting
without us by any chance?

1120
01:17:53,083 --> 01:17:54,000
Oh no.

1121
01:17:54,166 --> 01:17:56,541
Here I am mourning the loss of
my gun and you talk about hunting!

1122
01:17:56,666 --> 01:17:58,041
Your gun is missing?

1123
01:17:58,208 --> 01:18:01,083
What? Your son
has been kidnapped?

1124
01:18:01,208 --> 01:18:04,125
Someone has stolen my gun
to strip me of my dignity.

1125
01:18:04,333 --> 01:18:05,416
Don't worry, sir.

1126
01:18:05,541 --> 01:18:07,958
It is our duty to retrieve
your gun within 24 hours.

1127
01:18:08,125 --> 01:18:09,291
Let's go.

1128
01:18:09,791 --> 01:18:12,333
Sivarama Raju must be
in a state of shock now.

1129
01:18:12,458 --> 01:18:14,583
He must be scared
out of his wits!

1130
01:18:15,125 --> 01:18:18,625
I'm telling you to learn this art
but you're turning a deaf ear!

1131
01:18:18,750 --> 01:18:21,000
It seems that I should
learn his art

1132
01:18:21,125 --> 01:18:22,958
of foretelling
with cowrie shells.

1133
01:18:23,083 --> 01:18:24,208
Go, roll the shells!

1134
01:18:24,333 --> 01:18:25,791
Hey! Sambaiyaa!

1135
01:18:26,666 --> 01:18:28,333
Good afternoon, sir.
What can I do for you?

1136
01:18:28,458 --> 01:18:30,250
Mr. Sivarama Raju's gun
is missing from his house.

1137
01:18:30,375 --> 01:18:33,208
We want you to foresee
with your cowrie shells.

1138
01:18:33,750 --> 01:18:37,166
Oracle of the cowrie shells..
Goddess, show us the way.

1139
01:18:37,958 --> 01:18:40,541
1+1=2
2+2=4

1140
01:18:40,666 --> 01:18:42,666
Naturally! As if
2+2 can be 14?

1141
01:18:42,791 --> 01:18:44,666
Tell us who the thief is.

1142
01:18:46,083 --> 01:18:48,375
There were 2 of them.

1143
01:18:48,666 --> 01:18:51,250
Looks like your father
will point his finger at us!

1144
01:18:51,375 --> 01:18:52,333
He will toe the line

1145
01:18:52,458 --> 01:18:53,750
in his first ball
with full line and length.

1146
01:18:53,875 --> 01:18:55,916
Then the rest will be all wide.

1147
01:18:56,583 --> 01:18:58,833
2+3=5
3+6=9

1148
01:18:58,958 --> 01:19:00,625
The thief has been caught.

1149
01:19:01,625 --> 01:19:03,625
Who is he?
- If I should tell you

1150
01:19:03,750 --> 01:19:04,958
then you must
satisfy the cowry-king!

1151
01:19:05,083 --> 01:19:08,833
Okay, fine. Tell me.
- 25 kilos of rice, 5 kilos of lentils.

1152
01:19:08,958 --> 01:19:09,958
One country chicken.

1153
01:19:10,083 --> 01:19:11,333
We'll give you
a full bottle of rum.

1154
01:19:11,458 --> 01:19:13,166
That too.
- We'll give all of that.

1155
01:19:13,291 --> 01:19:14,833
Tell us who the thief is.

1156
01:19:14,958 --> 01:19:17,541
Your father may bowl
a full toss at us!

1157
01:19:17,708 --> 01:19:18,916
Don't worry.

1158
01:19:19,041 --> 01:19:21,625
Last ball will be
a no ball for sure.

1159
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,875
"Full toss.."

1160
01:19:26,833 --> 01:19:31,000
The thief has a mole, the size of
a cowrie shell on his right hand.

1161
01:19:34,250 --> 01:19:35,458
Got him.
Let's go search.

1162
01:19:35,583 --> 01:19:37,666
Whoever has a mole
on his right hand

1163
01:19:37,791 --> 01:19:39,416
we'll chop his hand
and bring him over.

1164
01:19:39,541 --> 01:19:40,916
Let's go.
- Let's go.

1165
01:19:49,083 --> 01:19:51,166
Are you my father or a sadist?
- What happened?

1166
01:19:51,291 --> 01:19:54,083
Look! The mark you identified
for the thief is on my hand. - Oh no.

1167
01:19:54,208 --> 01:19:56,750
No wonder it was so familiar.
I didn't remember that it as yours.

1168
01:19:56,875 --> 01:19:58,083
Why me?

1169
01:19:58,208 --> 01:20:00,416
Don't worry.
I'll handle it.

1170
01:20:00,541 --> 01:20:02,958
Hey, Chittibabu!
- Yes. - Please wait.

1171
01:20:03,083 --> 01:20:05,791
Even my son has a mole
on his right hand.

1172
01:20:05,916 --> 01:20:08,333
Don't think that he is the thief
and chop his hands off.

1173
01:20:10,083 --> 01:20:11,083
Tell me.
- I don't know.

1174
01:20:11,208 --> 01:20:12,833
I don't know.
- Where's the gun?

1175
01:20:12,958 --> 01:20:13,875
Don't act.

1176
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,333
We'll skin you alive.
- Mr. Shivaraman!

1177
01:20:16,458 --> 01:20:18,375
My hands are tied
I can't even plead with you.

1178
01:20:18,500 --> 01:20:20,708
You should be magnanimous
and understand my plight.

1179
01:20:20,833 --> 01:20:21,916
I don't know.

1180
01:20:22,041 --> 01:20:25,333
It hurts.
- Then who knows if you don't?

1181
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:28,333
Dhanaraj knows.
I don't know.

1182
01:20:28,583 --> 01:20:29,583
Dhanaraj?

1183
01:20:29,708 --> 01:20:31,458
Drag Dhanaraj here.

1184
01:20:31,583 --> 01:20:33,916
Who told you that
I stole the gun?

1185
01:20:34,041 --> 01:20:36,666
Drunkard Ramesh!
- Is he some big shot CBI officer?

1186
01:20:36,791 --> 01:20:38,166
Why did you
tell my name?

1187
01:20:38,291 --> 01:20:41,333
I said that you have a high IQ.
Is that wrong?

1188
01:20:41,458 --> 01:20:44,250
Beat him up.
- Beat him to a pulp.

1189
01:20:48,416 --> 01:20:49,750
Don't beat me up.

1190
01:20:54,166 --> 01:20:55,208
You?

1191
01:20:55,333 --> 01:20:56,375
Why did you
take the gun?

1192
01:20:56,500 --> 01:20:57,583
Vengeance.

1193
01:20:57,708 --> 01:21:00,750
Why?
- Your father hit this boy.

1194
01:21:00,875 --> 01:21:02,708
Why did my father hit you?

1195
01:21:02,875 --> 01:21:05,958
After I stopped your wedding,
as if he'll offer me fruit salad?

1196
01:21:06,083 --> 01:21:07,916
Sorry.
- Okay.

1197
01:21:08,291 --> 01:21:09,500
Please return the gun
to my father.

1198
01:21:09,625 --> 01:21:12,458
He has been crying like
a small kid for the past 2 days!

1199
01:21:12,583 --> 01:21:14,875
He thinks of this gun
as his eldest son.

1200
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,500
Hello, sister-in-law!

1201
01:21:16,625 --> 01:21:19,291
Please tell your sister
to express her love for me.

1202
01:21:21,250 --> 01:21:22,250
Give me the gun first.

1203
01:21:22,375 --> 01:21:24,125
Say 'I love you'.
- I won't.

1204
01:21:24,250 --> 01:21:25,583
Tell me.
- Please!

1205
01:21:25,791 --> 01:21:27,291
I want to hear you say 'I love you'.
- Please.

1206
01:21:27,958 --> 01:21:29,875
I won't.

1207
01:21:40,375 --> 01:21:42,500
"Oh, my girl.."

1208
01:21:44,875 --> 01:21:47,125
"Oh, my girl.."

1209
01:21:49,333 --> 01:21:52,208
What did you especially
install into girls, God?

1210
01:21:52,416 --> 01:21:55,625
However strong a man is,
one gesture and he falls flat!

1211
01:21:56,125 --> 01:21:57,583
The Gods must be crazy!

1212
01:21:58,500 --> 01:22:00,375
The gun has been found.

1213
01:22:00,583 --> 01:22:02,000
Stop hitting me.
He got his gun.

1214
01:22:02,125 --> 01:22:03,958
My gun is back.
My dear 'son'!

1215
01:22:04,166 --> 01:22:05,416
Untie me now.

1216
01:22:05,541 --> 01:22:07,500
As if you were even tied
for us to untie you now!

1217
01:22:07,625 --> 01:22:08,750
Drunkard!

1218
01:22:08,875 --> 01:22:10,458
You found the gun?
- Yes.

1219
01:22:11,750 --> 01:22:12,750
Where was it?

1220
01:22:12,875 --> 01:22:14,583
In the kitchen, dad.

1221
01:22:15,500 --> 01:22:17,666
How can the gun that was
on the wall be in the kitchen?

1222
01:22:17,791 --> 01:22:20,000
Perfect point, sir
- Yes.

1223
01:22:20,166 --> 01:22:22,666
I'll tell you.
Come closer.

1224
01:22:23,083 --> 01:22:24,375
Bend a little.

1225
01:22:26,333 --> 01:22:27,750
Yes, you're right

1226
01:22:27,875 --> 01:22:30,291
The gun has been found.
You all can leave now.

1227
01:22:30,416 --> 01:22:33,541
Let's go.
- My gun is like my son!

1228
01:22:35,125 --> 01:22:36,541
Hey, who's getting married?

1229
01:22:36,833 --> 01:22:40,166
Your girl's friend, Vanaja.

1230
01:22:40,833 --> 01:22:42,041
Meow!

1231
01:22:54,541 --> 01:22:58,041
If she doesn't fall for me,
that's the end of my life.

1232
01:22:58,166 --> 01:23:00,208
You can't live even if she loves you.
- Why?

1233
01:23:00,375 --> 01:23:02,666
Don't you know
about her father's bet?

1234
01:23:02,791 --> 01:23:06,208
He has to chop both his ears
if his daughter falls in love.

1235
01:23:06,416 --> 01:23:08,916
Let him chop his ears
or any other part he wants.

1236
01:23:09,041 --> 01:23:11,000
She is mine
I swear on his ears!

1237
01:23:11,125 --> 01:23:12,916
Alright..

1238
01:23:17,458 --> 01:23:18,875
Let's go.

1239
01:23:31,083 --> 01:23:32,375
What are you looking at?

1240
01:23:32,500 --> 01:23:33,583
Get in.

1241
01:23:33,958 --> 01:23:36,833
We must check out the groom.

1242
01:23:36,958 --> 01:23:38,458
Excuse me.
Thank you.

1243
01:23:39,416 --> 01:23:41,500
We should all join
and surround him.

1244
01:23:41,625 --> 01:23:42,833
Meow!

1245
01:23:42,958 --> 01:23:44,375
But..
- Meow!

1246
01:23:56,666 --> 01:24:00,416
Do you know, you look like an apple
that has been draped in a red sari?

1247
01:24:00,541 --> 01:24:01,458
I know.

1248
01:24:01,666 --> 01:24:04,791
We have a mirror at home!
I had a good look at myself.

1249
01:24:04,916 --> 01:24:07,958
Few people are aware that
you have an overload of temerity.

1250
01:24:08,083 --> 01:24:12,000
Beauty and temerity
go hand in hand!

1251
01:24:13,083 --> 01:24:14,875
You are going to fall down!

1252
01:24:27,958 --> 01:24:32,791
"Girl draped in a cherry red sari
with 2 plaits neatly braided."

1253
01:24:32,916 --> 01:24:37,750
"Anointed with white jasmines..
Break open my heart.."

1254
01:24:37,875 --> 01:24:40,583
"Only you'll see your picture
etched deep in my heart.."

1255
01:24:40,750 --> 01:24:42,750
"Break open my heart.."

1256
01:24:42,875 --> 01:24:45,500
"Only your picture imprinted deep
you'll see in my heart.."

1257
01:24:45,625 --> 01:24:50,166
"Clad in a flowery shirt
and a checked 'lungi'.."

1258
01:24:50,291 --> 01:24:55,041
"Such cool sunglasses..
And slippers that flip flop."

1259
01:24:55,166 --> 01:24:57,500
"Man with dimples!"

1260
01:24:57,666 --> 01:25:00,333
"Don't follow me here,
there and everywhere."

1261
01:25:00,458 --> 01:25:02,458
"You dimpled dude
of wicked repute!"

1262
01:25:02,583 --> 01:25:05,500
"Don't tail me now
like a shadow."

1263
01:25:05,625 --> 01:25:08,041
"I want to tell you
something, O' my baby!"

1264
01:25:08,208 --> 01:25:10,416
When you move, it
makes my mind go crazy."

1265
01:25:10,541 --> 01:25:12,750
"Bring it on now.."

1266
01:25:12,875 --> 01:25:15,458
"Shake that..
Shake that booty!"

1267
01:25:15,583 --> 01:25:17,708
"I want to tell you
something, O' my baby!"

1268
01:25:17,958 --> 01:25:20,166
"When you move, it
makes my mind go crazy."

1269
01:25:20,291 --> 01:25:25,083
"Bring it on now.. Shake that..
Shake that booty!"

1270
01:25:25,208 --> 01:25:30,208
"From the day I met you, dear..
My mind disobeys words that I utter."

1271
01:25:30,333 --> 01:25:32,750
"I'll gift you a sari
plus a life full of kisses."

1272
01:25:32,875 --> 01:25:34,833
"Say 'yes'.
Just once."

1273
01:25:35,083 --> 01:25:39,875
"I swear that you're a pain in the neck..
I don't need your loving connect."

1274
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:44,083
"Don't offer me carrots
and create a ruckus."

1275
01:25:44,625 --> 01:25:49,958
"I feel like you and I have gone
around the world on a unicorn."

1276
01:25:50,125 --> 01:25:54,750
"Why am I this mad, tell me?
I'm madly in love with you, my beloved."

1277
01:25:54,875 --> 01:25:56,958
"You're tender like Palmyra fruit
girl, you refresh me altogether"

1278
01:25:57,083 --> 01:25:59,583
"If you say no to me,
how will my life be?"

1279
01:25:59,708 --> 01:26:02,166
"You're tender like Palmyra fruit..
Girl, you rejuvenate me, dear."

1280
01:26:02,291 --> 01:26:05,041
"If you say no to me,
how will my life be happy?"

1281
01:26:24,541 --> 01:26:29,333
"Girl from God's own country..
You made a royal entry."

1282
01:26:29,458 --> 01:26:31,833
"I'll treat you like royalty..
I'll gift my kingdom totally."

1283
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,375
"Don't act pricey
and make me suffer any longer."

1284
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:39,208
"Many have followed me..
It's no big deal really!"

1285
01:26:39,333 --> 01:26:43,708
"Like finding a chicken for a feast,
rejoicing as treat on seeing a chick."

1286
01:26:43,875 --> 01:26:46,875
"Like fire crackers
exploding into stars.."

1287
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,250
"Like wings sprout to fly
into the azure blue sky.."

1288
01:26:49,375 --> 01:26:54,083
"Girl, tie me up
to your sari's end like glue."

1289
01:26:54,250 --> 01:26:58,958
"Girl with eyes of fish, as
slippery as an eel!"

1290
01:26:59,083 --> 01:27:04,750
"Girl with eyes of fish,
as slippery as an eel!"

1291
01:27:07,166 --> 01:27:08,666
Is it?
- Where's the groom?

1292
01:27:08,791 --> 01:27:10,083
He's over there.

1293
01:27:10,208 --> 01:27:13,250
Is he the groom?
- But when I..

1294
01:27:13,500 --> 01:27:14,958
Mr. Bridegroom?

1295
01:27:17,791 --> 01:27:19,833
Uncle, you?

1296
01:27:24,458 --> 01:27:27,250
If I'm married with
2 kids like him

1297
01:27:27,375 --> 01:27:29,916
then you can
call me uncle.

1298
01:27:30,041 --> 01:27:32,416
Every bachelor is
considered young.

1299
01:27:32,541 --> 01:27:33,625
Okay, uncle.

1300
01:27:33,750 --> 01:27:36,416
If you move, we can
go and see the bride.

1301
01:27:36,541 --> 01:27:38,416
She's bent on tearing
my dignity to shreds.

1302
01:27:39,208 --> 01:27:40,583
Go, please.

1303
01:27:40,916 --> 01:27:43,208
Grandpa, move please.
- She won't reform.

1304
01:27:43,333 --> 01:27:45,333
I'm the groom. I'll be there.

1305
01:27:45,500 --> 01:27:52,333
"Virtuous like Lord Rama..
Courageous like Bhima.."

1306
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:54,833
Looks like the orchestra has
planned a special song for me.

1307
01:27:54,958 --> 01:27:55,958
So cute!

1308
01:27:56,500 --> 01:27:59,125
"He stands apart exclusively.."

1309
01:28:00,166 --> 01:28:01,416
Hi, sir.

1310
01:28:01,791 --> 01:28:03,041
Who are you, sir?

1311
01:28:03,166 --> 01:28:04,458
I'm from the VIP union, sir.

1312
01:28:04,583 --> 01:28:06,791
We came to make your wedding
talk of the town!

1313
01:28:07,208 --> 01:28:08,875
You seem very positive, sir.
- Yes.

1314
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:10,500
I love you, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

1315
01:28:10,625 --> 01:28:14,000
Your groom-look is affected
by your weird body odor.

1316
01:28:14,125 --> 01:28:15,666
What soap do you use?

1317
01:28:15,791 --> 01:28:17,083
Give it to me. This one.

1318
01:28:18,583 --> 01:28:19,958
I'll get you the best one.

1319
01:28:22,416 --> 01:28:26,041
"I fell in love..
I am in love.."

1320
01:28:26,166 --> 01:28:28,500
"I fell in love.."

1321
01:28:29,875 --> 01:28:36,916
"To give up my life willingly
for your love, my darling."

1322
01:28:37,416 --> 01:28:39,000
What do you want?
- Before the wedding

1323
01:28:39,625 --> 01:28:41,583
can we rehearse just once?

1324
01:28:41,750 --> 01:28:42,666
You've got high hopes!

1325
01:28:42,791 --> 01:28:45,125
You have a one track mind!

1326
01:28:45,250 --> 01:28:48,000
I meant the marriage rehearsal.

1327
01:28:48,291 --> 01:28:49,791
Why did you
come here now?

1328
01:28:49,916 --> 01:28:51,541
I want Lux.

1329
01:28:51,708 --> 01:28:53,041
Did you mean 'make love'?

1330
01:28:53,166 --> 01:28:55,375
Looks like someone is inviting.

1331
01:28:55,541 --> 01:28:56,916
Shut up.

1332
01:28:58,166 --> 01:28:59,833
Thanks.
- Don't mention.

1333
01:28:59,958 --> 01:29:01,125
Take it, anyway.

1334
01:29:01,250 --> 01:29:03,708
The soap.
- Lift your arms. I'll spray some powder.

1335
01:29:03,916 --> 01:29:05,291
Go ahead and spray.

1336
01:29:05,750 --> 01:29:08,875
This smell is from
a different world!

1337
01:29:11,041 --> 01:29:12,125
Hey!
- What happened?

1338
01:29:12,250 --> 01:29:13,500
Get up, sir.

1339
01:29:13,625 --> 01:29:16,083
If you have to snuff this smell,
we definitely need some cologne.

1340
01:29:17,041 --> 01:29:18,291
Meow!

1341
01:29:18,583 --> 01:29:21,083
What?
- This is for the bride's safety.

1342
01:29:21,208 --> 01:29:23,041
Groom needs a cologne.
Compulsorily.

1343
01:29:23,791 --> 01:29:26,625
Hey.. I'm not used to public
demonstration of affection.

1344
01:29:27,666 --> 01:29:29,000
I'll kill you.
- Why?

1345
01:29:30,041 --> 01:29:32,125
The bride is not in favor
of marrying this groom.

1346
01:29:32,250 --> 01:29:33,375
We must talk
to the groom

1347
01:29:33,500 --> 01:29:35,291
to cancel the wedding.

1348
01:29:43,500 --> 01:29:45,500
Instead of all of you
ganging up to drown me

1349
01:29:45,625 --> 01:29:46,875
can't you convince her?

1350
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:50,041
Suppose we convince her
and she marries you

1351
01:29:50,166 --> 01:29:52,166
and tomorrow if she
continues to be with her lover

1352
01:29:52,375 --> 01:29:54,291
it won't give you
peace of mind, right?

1353
01:29:54,416 --> 01:29:56,208
It is horrible
to even hear it.

1354
01:29:56,333 --> 01:29:58,333
That's why, just make
this sacrifice, please!

1355
01:29:58,458 --> 01:30:00,958
Is my wedding cancelled?

1356
01:30:01,083 --> 01:30:02,083
Cancelled.

1357
01:30:02,375 --> 01:30:04,583
Is it?
Yes, it is.

1358
01:30:04,708 --> 01:30:10,458
"All the Rajini fans..
Don't miss the chance!"

1359
01:30:10,666 --> 01:30:11,666
"All the Rajini fans.."

1360
01:30:11,791 --> 01:30:13,458
I can't bear his torture!

1361
01:30:13,583 --> 01:30:16,041
"Don't miss the chance.."

1362
01:30:16,166 --> 01:30:19,833
"Lungi dance.. Lungi
dance.. Lungi dance.."

1363
01:30:20,708 --> 01:30:22,333
What is it, sir?
- Nothing, dude!

1364
01:30:24,208 --> 01:30:29,166
A heart breaking news
to all my kith and kin.

1365
01:30:29,291 --> 01:30:30,791
This wedding will happen.

1366
01:30:30,916 --> 01:30:32,791
But I'm not the groom.

1367
01:30:32,916 --> 01:30:34,750
To make this love blossom

1368
01:30:34,875 --> 01:30:36,375
I'm sacrificing
my marriage.

1369
01:30:44,666 --> 01:30:51,041
"There's true love in your eyes..
It sparkles from your heart too.."

1370
01:30:51,166 --> 01:30:57,666
"Words don't cross your lips at all.
Why this silence, my beautiful doll?"

1371
01:30:57,791 --> 01:31:04,291
"You are a dainty little rose twig..
But please don't prick with your thorn."

1372
01:31:04,416 --> 01:31:10,333
"How long will this silent spree last
which spears my heart severely?"

1373
01:31:10,458 --> 01:31:16,916
"I'm born with a reason, sweety..
To receive your love's bounty."

1374
01:31:17,041 --> 01:31:23,458
"All along my soul longs to
merge with your breath too."

1375
01:31:23,583 --> 01:31:30,500
"For the love of God, dear,
don't play with my love like this."

1376
01:31:31,750 --> 01:31:33,375
What kind of
a pose is this?

1377
01:31:33,500 --> 01:31:34,916
Standing like
Ram Gopal Varma.

1378
01:31:35,041 --> 01:31:36,416
You must know to
pose for a picture.

1379
01:31:36,958 --> 01:31:38,791
Excuse me. Come here.

1380
01:31:39,333 --> 01:31:40,500
Wait..
- Kavitha?

1381
01:31:40,625 --> 01:31:42,250
Yes, mom.

1382
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,625
Raju! You're rocking
in that flex board, man.

1383
01:31:53,875 --> 01:31:56,041
You look as awesome as
hero NTR in the film 'Hunter'.

1384
01:31:56,166 --> 01:31:58,375
Shut up!
Who did that without asking me?

1385
01:31:58,500 --> 01:31:59,541
I did.

1386
01:32:00,208 --> 01:32:02,041
Why?
- Publicity.

1387
01:32:03,375 --> 01:32:06,500
If by chance Mr. Sivarama Raju
sees this, he'll know that I stole his gun.

1388
01:32:06,625 --> 01:32:08,958
But he won't be attending
this wedding for sure.

1389
01:32:09,083 --> 01:32:10,208
He's here!

1390
01:32:10,375 --> 01:32:12,333
Greetings, sir!
- Greetings.

1391
01:32:14,958 --> 01:32:17,666
I told you.
Bring that banana tree and hide it. Go!

1392
01:32:43,083 --> 01:32:44,458
Siva sir!

1393
01:32:44,625 --> 01:32:45,708
What?

1394
01:32:56,000 --> 01:33:00,166
Even you wouldn't have taken
a picture with your gun like this.

1395
01:33:00,333 --> 01:33:03,958
Before he dances on your head,
you must put an end to him!

1396
01:33:04,083 --> 01:33:05,458
What are you waiting for?

1397
01:33:05,625 --> 01:33:06,958
My blood is boiling.

1398
01:33:07,083 --> 01:33:08,083
My veins are bursting.

1399
01:33:08,250 --> 01:33:09,750
We should teach him
a lesson that he won't forget.

1400
01:33:09,875 --> 01:33:12,916
Maybe he is destined
to die at my hands!

1401
01:33:13,791 --> 01:33:16,208
That's why he is
playing with fire.

1402
01:33:24,416 --> 01:33:26,541
What were you doing
with Raju at the wedding?

1403
01:33:26,916 --> 01:33:28,833
You can have your way
in everything at this house.

1404
01:33:28,958 --> 01:33:32,125
But only your father
will choose your husband.

1405
01:33:32,250 --> 01:33:33,916
It's not what you think, mom.

1406
01:33:34,208 --> 01:33:36,916
If you are hoping otherwise,
just forget about it. Go.

1407
01:33:40,166 --> 01:33:46,583
"There's true love in your eyes..
It sparkles from your heart too."

1408
01:33:46,708 --> 01:33:53,125
"Words don't cross your lips at all..
Why this silence, my beautiful doll?"

1409
01:33:53,416 --> 01:33:59,750
"You are a dainty little rose twig.. But
please don't prick me with your thorn."

1410
01:33:59,875 --> 01:34:05,791
"How long will this silent spree last
which spears my heart severely?"

1411
01:34:05,916 --> 01:34:12,375
"I am born with a reason, sweety..
To receive your love's bounty."

1412
01:34:12,500 --> 01:34:18,916
"All along my soul longs to
merge with your breath too."

1413
01:34:19,041 --> 01:34:26,041
"For the love of God, dear,
don't play with my love like this."

1414
01:34:26,208 --> 01:34:29,583
"There's true love in your eyes.."

1415
01:34:29,750 --> 01:34:31,708
10 days since I saw
a glimpse of my darling.

1416
01:34:31,875 --> 01:34:33,250
Maybe she changed sides!

1417
01:34:33,375 --> 01:34:35,750
Is this politics
to change sides?

1418
01:34:35,875 --> 01:34:37,125
How can you mix love..

1419
01:34:37,250 --> 01:34:39,583
Sivarama Raju's cow
has fallen into the well.

1420
01:34:39,708 --> 01:34:41,208
Why didn't he also fall in?

1421
01:34:41,333 --> 01:34:43,541
Shut up!
Kavitha loves that cow.

1422
01:34:43,666 --> 01:34:44,875
Let's go.

1423
01:34:47,541 --> 01:34:50,583
My dear Lakshmi..
- What happened?

1424
01:34:50,708 --> 01:34:53,333
The cow has fallen into the well.
We don't know what to do.

1425
01:34:53,458 --> 01:34:55,333
Where is your husband?
- He has gone to visit the town.

1426
01:34:55,458 --> 01:34:57,500
Who is there?

1427
01:34:59,416 --> 01:35:00,625
Stop.

1428
01:35:02,666 --> 01:35:03,791
The cow has
fallen into the well.

1429
01:35:03,916 --> 01:35:05,250
Make it soon.
- Who was that on the phone?

1430
01:35:05,375 --> 01:35:06,625
Please come soon.

1431
01:35:07,041 --> 01:35:08,500
Fire station, dad.

1432
01:35:10,083 --> 01:35:11,416
Don't worry.

1433
01:35:11,666 --> 01:35:13,375
Nothing will happen
to your cow.

1434
01:35:13,666 --> 01:35:15,041
Careful!

1435
01:35:25,125 --> 01:35:28,250
Careful, if the cow gets scared,
it might kick you in fear.

1436
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:37,666
Thanks for jumping in
for my sake.

1437
01:35:37,791 --> 01:35:38,833
As if I jumped!

1438
01:35:38,958 --> 01:35:40,250
Your dad pushed me.

1439
01:35:40,375 --> 01:35:42,041
The cow is petrified.

1440
01:35:42,166 --> 01:35:43,875
Father, the cow is
dragging me under.

1441
01:35:44,166 --> 01:35:45,333
Be careful.

1442
01:35:55,125 --> 01:35:58,083
Father, throw the rope down.

1443
01:35:58,208 --> 01:35:59,875
Throw the rope down for him.

1444
01:36:01,208 --> 01:36:02,291
Fasten it properly.

1445
01:36:02,416 --> 01:36:04,541
Hold it.
- It might kick you.

1446
01:36:09,625 --> 01:36:11,333
Father?
Throw the towel at me.

1447
01:36:11,458 --> 01:36:12,791
Here!

1448
01:36:15,666 --> 01:36:18,958
Towel is to blindfold the cow
so it doesn't get scared.

1449
01:36:19,250 --> 01:36:20,125
Father, now pull.

1450
01:36:20,250 --> 01:36:21,958
It's done.
- Hey, pull them up now.

1451
01:36:22,125 --> 01:36:24,375
One breath, hold
and pull altogether.

1452
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:27,583
Gently!

1453
01:36:27,958 --> 01:36:29,875
Hold on to it tightly.

1454
01:36:32,958 --> 01:36:34,000
It has been rescued.

1455
01:36:36,208 --> 01:36:38,375
Look at it.
The calf is here.

1456
01:37:02,916 --> 01:37:04,666
Go and give him this
to dry himself up.

1457
01:37:22,958 --> 01:37:27,375
"Oh, my girl.."

1458
01:37:27,541 --> 01:37:31,833
"Oh, my girl.."

1459
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:36,833
"Oh, my girl.."

1460
01:37:42,458 --> 01:37:45,500
Without feeling shy,
let me tell you this.

1461
01:37:46,375 --> 01:37:47,708
I'm in love with you.

1462
01:37:49,416 --> 01:37:53,708
"Oh, my girl.."

1463
01:37:53,875 --> 01:37:57,416
"Oh, my girl.."

1464
01:37:57,875 --> 01:37:59,958
Can I wink at you once?

1465
01:38:04,666 --> 01:38:06,208
She loves me!

1466
01:38:14,833 --> 01:38:17,541
Sir, that chap
ahead of us is Raju.

1467
01:38:45,375 --> 01:38:47,458
Why are you
standing here?

1468
01:38:47,583 --> 01:38:50,208
We came to take
a look at our land.

1469
01:38:50,333 --> 01:38:51,791
Okay.

1470
01:38:55,750 --> 01:38:57,875
Hi, ma'am.
- Hello, Raju. Did your bike conk off?

1471
01:38:58,125 --> 01:39:01,375
Alcohol.. I mean, the fuel
level in the bike is low.

1472
01:39:01,875 --> 01:39:03,625
Okay, get in.
I'll drop you.

1473
01:39:05,958 --> 01:39:08,583
Long time no see. No issues
for VIP union to handle?

1474
01:39:08,708 --> 01:39:10,791
My problems are more
than a handful, ma'am.

1475
01:39:22,041 --> 01:39:24,166
No, not now.

1476
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:35,250
Meow!

1477
01:39:57,583 --> 01:39:58,666
What?

1478
01:40:11,416 --> 01:40:12,958
Why are you so happy?

1479
01:40:13,083 --> 01:40:14,166
Did you think it was gold?

1480
01:40:14,291 --> 01:40:18,375
It's artificial.
- You gave it. So it's gold to me.

1481
01:40:57,750 --> 01:40:59,708
He's walking like a robot.

1482
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:03,791
He has this habit
of walking in his sleep.

1483
01:41:06,458 --> 01:41:08,541
Thank God
he doesn't catwalk!

1484
01:41:08,791 --> 01:41:10,791
People would have been
traumatized seeing him.

1485
01:41:10,916 --> 01:41:13,833
This was our excuse
to return the gun.

1486
01:41:13,958 --> 01:41:16,791
<i>You sleepwalk, don't you?
You must've kept it and forgotten.</i>

1487
01:41:16,916 --> 01:41:18,125
Understand?

1488
01:41:41,958 --> 01:41:44,375
Your dad walks a marathon!

1489
01:41:44,791 --> 01:41:46,375
I'll handle this.

1490
01:41:57,916 --> 01:41:59,041
Hey!

1491
01:42:02,083 --> 01:42:05,666
Sir, if you make rounds like this
you'll burn way too many calories.

1492
01:42:07,083 --> 01:42:09,958
Hey! Even in his sleep
he twirls his moustache!

1493
01:42:12,375 --> 01:42:13,666
So cute!

1494
01:42:18,875 --> 01:42:20,041
Oh no!

1495
01:42:31,791 --> 01:42:33,708
Is it morning already, uncle?

1496
01:42:35,208 --> 01:42:37,791
I didn't hear the rooster.

1497
01:42:43,041 --> 01:42:46,166
Good morning, uncle.
- Parvati!

1498
01:42:47,208 --> 01:42:48,208
I need the gun!

1499
01:42:48,333 --> 01:42:50,541
Raju, run!

1500
01:43:17,250 --> 01:43:18,583
Kavitha?

1501
01:43:23,458 --> 01:43:26,333
In a week's time, you will
marry the groom of my choice.

1502
01:43:28,041 --> 01:43:30,500
Will you marry the groom
I choose, or will you not?

1503
01:43:32,750 --> 01:43:35,125
Do you agree or not?

1504
01:43:39,083 --> 01:43:40,583
Razak!
- Yes.

1505
01:43:41,333 --> 01:43:42,708
Don't, dear.

1506
01:43:43,250 --> 01:43:44,541
Don't, dad.

1507
01:43:44,750 --> 01:43:46,041
Answer me.

1508
01:43:46,708 --> 01:43:49,208
Will you marry the man
I choose or not?

1509
01:43:49,333 --> 01:43:53,791
Dad, Raju is a good man.
Give it a thought, dad.

1510
01:43:53,916 --> 01:43:55,750
Razak! - Yes, sir.
- Press the trigger.

1511
01:43:55,875 --> 01:43:58,041
No, dad, don't.

1512
01:44:01,416 --> 01:44:03,375
I'll marry the groom
you choose for me, dad.

1513
01:44:16,208 --> 01:44:17,625
The bride and the groom
like each other.

1514
01:44:17,750 --> 01:44:19,166
Please exchange plates
to signify your consent.

1515
01:44:19,291 --> 01:44:20,541
One minute.

1516
01:44:21,958 --> 01:44:23,916
Hello?
- Hello, is it Mr. Prakashraj?

1517
01:44:24,041 --> 01:44:25,791
Yes.
- Where are you?

1518
01:44:25,916 --> 01:44:27,958
We were just about to
finalize a bride for me.

1519
01:44:28,333 --> 01:44:30,166
Oh! If you're still free
we want you to marry

1520
01:44:30,291 --> 01:44:33,083
Mr. Sivarama Raju's daughter.
- One minute, sir. Be on the line.

1521
01:44:33,208 --> 01:44:34,541
Sivarama Raju's daughter

1522
01:44:34,666 --> 01:44:37,791
is 7, 8, 14, 16..

1523
01:44:38,333 --> 01:44:39,333
Hi-tech city!

1524
01:44:39,458 --> 01:44:41,833
Is it confirmed
at least this time, sir?

1525
01:44:42,250 --> 01:44:43,375
100 percent!

1526
01:44:43,500 --> 01:44:44,875
Thank you, sir.
Thank you very much.

1527
01:44:45,333 --> 01:44:48,583
Sir, please forgive me.
This engagement is cancelled.

1528
01:44:48,708 --> 01:44:51,500
Thank God! We weren't
keen on this alliance.

1529
01:44:51,625 --> 01:44:53,916
We weren't happy
about it either.

1530
01:44:55,583 --> 01:44:58,083
'Tanikella Chandraiya
and family'

1531
01:45:00,625 --> 01:45:02,333
It's Kavitha's wedding.

1532
01:45:04,041 --> 01:45:05,416
You must definitely come.

1533
01:45:13,041 --> 01:45:16,875
Just because you know how to swim
you shouldn't jump into the sea.

1534
01:45:17,833 --> 01:45:19,208
It's dangerous to life!

1535
01:45:23,375 --> 01:45:25,375
If you watch the wedding
you won't be able to take it.

1536
01:45:25,500 --> 01:45:29,875
Bring all your VIP members.
Eat to your stomach's content.

1537
01:45:33,125 --> 01:45:35,416
Is just a groom enough
to get married, dad?

1538
01:45:36,333 --> 01:45:39,375
Shouldn't her dad check
if she loves the groom or not?

1539
01:45:41,541 --> 01:45:44,375
Girls who take ages to
decide how to fall in love

1540
01:45:44,875 --> 01:45:47,583
ditch their lover
in split seconds.

1541
01:45:48,625 --> 01:45:49,875
Why is that so, dad?

1542
01:45:51,958 --> 01:45:54,625
If some chap did lament
about love failure

1543
01:45:55,500 --> 01:45:57,375
I used to smile
at his stupidity.

1544
01:45:58,291 --> 01:46:02,875
Only when the shoe pinches
do we feel the pain! Now I know.

1545
01:46:04,875 --> 01:46:08,875
I don't know whether I'll die
if I don't marry her.

1546
01:46:10,041 --> 01:46:13,666
But I know I won't be
in my normal senses.

1547
01:46:17,958 --> 01:46:21,541
Why is it that people I love
leave me and go away, dad?

1548
01:46:21,875 --> 01:46:23,875
My mother passed away
when I was a kid.

1549
01:46:24,666 --> 01:46:27,291
Now the girl I love has left me.

1550
01:46:28,083 --> 01:46:31,875
From this day onwards
I don't like you, dad.

1551
01:46:33,500 --> 01:46:35,083
I don't like you, dad.

1552
01:46:37,333 --> 01:46:40,708
A man who has lost
his mother when young

1553
01:46:40,958 --> 01:46:43,166
will cherish his wife
like a princess.

1554
01:46:43,291 --> 01:46:45,833
It's her loss
not yours.

1555
01:46:45,958 --> 01:46:47,541
Why are you crying?

1556
01:46:47,958 --> 01:46:49,708
You shouldn't be crying.

1557
01:46:52,166 --> 01:46:57,500
The wine shop has a cure
for those who face love failure.

1558
01:46:57,625 --> 01:47:00,333
Drink to the fullest
and bury your sorrow.

1559
01:47:00,458 --> 01:47:02,291
Dad?
- No sentiments.

1560
01:47:02,416 --> 01:47:03,916
Only entertainment.

1561
01:47:04,041 --> 01:47:05,458
<i>Alcohol consumption
is injurious to health.</i>

1562
01:47:05,583 --> 01:47:09,958
"If it slips from your hand, dude.
Let it go. Don't fret or fume."

1563
01:47:10,125 --> 01:47:11,041
<i>Alcohol consumption
is injurious to health.</i>

1564
01:47:11,208 --> 01:47:19,083
"Who in this universe, tell me
has conquered love perfectly?"

1565
01:47:19,458 --> 01:47:23,916
"Let go. Let it be.
Don't feel sorry."

1566
01:47:24,083 --> 01:47:26,708
<i>Alcohol consumption
is injurious to health.</i>

1567
01:47:26,875 --> 01:47:28,083
"Let it be.."

1568
01:47:30,208 --> 01:47:31,250
"Let it be.."

1569
01:47:31,375 --> 01:47:34,916
"Can you find even a single soul
who gained in love on the whole?"

1570
01:47:35,041 --> 01:47:38,916
"Hey! Tell me, do you know
anyone in love aglow?"

1571
01:47:39,041 --> 01:47:42,833
"Can you find even a single soul
blissfully in love on the whole?"

1572
01:47:42,958 --> 01:47:47,083
"Hey! Have you seen anybody
living happily in a love rhapsody?"

1573
01:47:47,208 --> 01:47:51,125
"Even today,
love ends only in tragedy."

1574
01:47:51,250 --> 01:47:55,083
"If you're seriously in love, be
ready, you'll be a piece of comedy."

1575
01:47:55,208 --> 01:47:57,041
"No need of all this rubbish
that love imparts.."

1576
01:47:57,208 --> 01:47:59,041
"Girls make mincemeat of
our hearts.."

1577
01:47:59,250 --> 01:48:02,958
"From now on, this four letter
word 'love' should be banned."

1578
01:48:03,125 --> 01:48:07,083
"Don't become a self-destructive Devdas
or the possessed lover, Majnu, pal."

1579
01:48:07,208 --> 01:48:10,958
"Forget endearments darling and dear..
Say cheers with your glass of beer."

1580
01:48:11,125 --> 01:48:14,916
"Where there's no love, there's no risk,
boss.. Be glad and go full toss."

1581
01:48:15,041 --> 01:48:19,583
"Don't merge love and heart ever after..
Better to submerge in quarter and water."

1582
01:48:20,708 --> 01:48:22,583
"Let it be.."

1583
01:48:22,708 --> 01:48:23,958
"Let it be.."

1584
01:48:24,625 --> 01:48:25,958
"Let it be.."

1585
01:48:27,041 --> 01:48:28,375
<i>Alcohol consumption

1586
01:48:28,583 --> 01:48:30,083
"Let it be.."

1587
01:48:30,625 --> 01:48:32,166
"Let it be.."

1588
01:48:32,500 --> 01:48:35,208
<i>Alcohol consumption
is injurious to health.</i>

1589
01:48:35,583 --> 01:48:39,375
"One look from this deadly doll..
I can hear my death bell toll."

1590
01:48:39,500 --> 01:48:43,500
"One smile from her lips, I slide..
I'm swimming in a tsunami tide."

1591
01:48:43,625 --> 01:48:47,458
"Her single touch gave me the love-bug..
I follow her now like Cheeka, the pug."

1592
01:48:47,583 --> 01:48:51,041
"She'll spoil my sleep completely..
And in wicked dreams dunk me."

1593
01:48:51,166 --> 01:48:55,208
"If she expresses her love and ditches
free entry to hell without glitches.."

1594
01:48:55,333 --> 01:48:59,125
"Like matchsticks are females..
They'll burn to ashes all males."

1595
01:48:59,250 --> 01:49:03,083
"Don't become a self-destructive Devdas
or the possessed lover, Majnu, pal."

1596
01:49:03,208 --> 01:49:06,958
"Forget endearments darling and dear..
Say cheers with your glass of beer."

1597
01:49:07,083 --> 01:49:10,958
"No love then no risk, boss..

"Don't merge love and heart ever after..

1599
01:49:15,750 --> 01:49:18,416
"Oh, Devdas.."

1600
01:49:19,250 --> 01:49:22,125
"Oh, Parvathi.."

1601
01:49:22,416 --> 01:49:31,208
"I am the anti-virus for
the virus called love."

1602
01:49:31,375 --> 01:49:34,125
"Oh, Devdas.."

1603
01:49:35,250 --> 01:49:38,416
"Oh, Parvathi.."

1604
01:49:40,166 --> 01:49:41,875
"Beat it."

1605
01:49:42,083 --> 01:49:43,708
"Faster!"

1606
01:49:44,166 --> 01:49:45,958
"Repeat it thrice
to the same beat.."

1607
01:49:46,083 --> 01:49:49,083
<i>Alcohol consumption

1609
01:49:55,500 --> 01:49:59,375
"Our lifestyle we must change.
Bury our ego, our lives rearrange."

1610
01:49:59,500 --> 01:50:03,458
"For a love that's not worth a rupee
don't give up on your friends."

1611
01:50:03,583 --> 01:50:07,541
"Don't fall in love, buddy.
You are dead then, trust me."

1612
01:50:07,666 --> 01:50:11,250
"No matter how much elders warn us
this heart disobeys, out of temerity."

1613
01:50:11,375 --> 01:50:15,125
"Colorful world will fade into despair..
Darkness will surround everywhere."

1614
01:50:15,250 --> 01:50:18,916
"Love cancer with no care
eats the boys' hearts bare.."

1615
01:50:19,041 --> 01:50:22,958
"Don't become a self-destructive Devdas

Raju.. Raju!

1622
01:50:48,750 --> 01:50:50,791
Sister asked me to
give this letter to you.

1623
01:50:50,958 --> 01:50:52,041
Sister?

1624
01:50:53,166 --> 01:50:55,250
Is your sister beautiful?

1625
01:50:55,500 --> 01:50:56,958
Not my sister.

1626
01:50:57,083 --> 01:50:58,416
Kavitha.

1627
01:50:58,583 --> 01:50:59,875
Kavitha!

1628
01:51:02,541 --> 01:51:04,708
<i>If I marry the groom
of my dad's choice</i>

1629
01:51:04,833 --> 01:51:06,791
<i>you think you can drink
and drown yourself in sorrow</i>

1630
01:51:06,916 --> 01:51:09,625
<i>then forget me and
find some other girl to love?</i>

1631
01:51:09,750 --> 01:51:11,250
<i>I'll kill you.</i>

1632
01:51:11,458 --> 01:51:13,208
<i>I am your wife
in this birth.</i>

1633
01:51:13,333 --> 01:51:16,833
<i>Come home at 1:00 a.m.
and take me away.</i>

1634
01:51:16,958 --> 01:51:18,208
<i>I love you.</i>

1635
01:51:18,958 --> 01:51:21,583
I love you too, Parvati..
No, Kavitha.

1636
01:51:22,083 --> 01:51:23,083
I am coming.

1637
01:51:23,208 --> 01:51:24,458
This way.

1638
01:51:24,708 --> 01:51:30,541
"Silver rays of moonlight
like a beautiful girl bright."

1639
01:51:30,666 --> 01:51:34,083
Sentimentally this combo
doesn't work for me, pal.

1640
01:51:34,666 --> 01:51:35,666
Don't get tensed.

1641
01:51:35,791 --> 01:51:37,125
This time your wedding
won't be stopped mid-way.

1642
01:51:37,250 --> 01:51:38,208
Sure.
- Sure.

1643
01:51:38,333 --> 01:51:39,708
It will happen for sure.

1644
01:51:40,583 --> 01:51:42,916
This looks perfect.
- "Without you I can't.."

1645
01:51:43,041 --> 01:51:44,916
Will you step out
for a moment, please?

1646
01:51:53,166 --> 01:51:56,125
Nageswara Reddy!
How long to wait?

1647
01:51:56,291 --> 01:51:57,500
Please go inside.

1648
01:52:07,750 --> 01:52:09,708
Meow!
- Meow!

1649
01:52:09,916 --> 01:52:18,958
"How wonderful it will be
if we can fly freely!"

1650
01:52:19,375 --> 01:52:28,583
"How delightful it will be
if we can float happily!"

1651
01:52:38,875 --> 01:52:41,166
Can't find the girl?

1652
01:52:41,375 --> 01:52:43,416
She said she couldn't find her baby.

1653
01:52:43,916 --> 01:52:45,291
She must be playing
somewhere nearby.

1654
01:52:45,416 --> 01:52:48,291
She doesn't mean it's a kid.
- Your bride, sir!

1655
01:52:56,125 --> 01:53:07,750
"You create a doll with life, oh Lord..
Is it fair then to infuse sorrow, God?"

1656
01:53:08,375 --> 01:53:10,500
Next is a sorrow song.

1657
01:53:10,833 --> 01:53:13,625
Hi!
- Sadist! What's your name?

1658
01:53:13,750 --> 01:53:14,958
Jesudas Paul.

1659
01:53:16,583 --> 01:53:18,875
Your name is worse
than your songs!

1660
01:53:19,291 --> 01:53:20,500
What's your name, ma'am?

1661
01:53:21,125 --> 01:53:22,250
Melody Ambrosia.

1662
01:53:23,750 --> 01:53:26,083
Not ambrosia.
This is poison.

1663
01:53:26,958 --> 01:53:29,666
I'm depressed as it is
with my bride running away

1664
01:53:29,791 --> 01:53:31,583
and you happily
sing a sad song.

1665
01:53:31,708 --> 01:53:34,250
You won't pay us then?
- You have the gall to ask for payment!

1666
01:53:34,375 --> 01:53:35,958
Veeraraju?
- What, man?

1667
01:53:36,166 --> 01:53:39,083
Sivarama Raju's daughter
has run away with Raju.

1668
01:53:39,208 --> 01:53:41,166
You've won your bet.

1669
01:53:47,541 --> 01:53:49,875
Don't..
- Move aside.

1670
01:54:02,375 --> 01:54:05,916
<i>Even if one of my daughters falls in love</i>

1671
01:54:06,041 --> 01:54:07,458
<i>I shall either kill both of them</i>

1672
01:54:07,583 --> 01:54:09,375
<i>or chop my ears off.</i>

1673
01:54:16,625 --> 01:54:18,958
Don't cry, baby.

1674
01:54:20,458 --> 01:54:22,375
How long will it take
for the train to arrive?

1675
01:54:22,500 --> 01:54:23,708
Anytime now.

1676
01:54:23,916 --> 01:54:28,541
Don't cry, my muffin.

1677
01:54:28,708 --> 01:54:29,875
Don't cry.

1678
01:54:50,458 --> 01:54:52,333
What happened, my princess?

1679
01:55:02,750 --> 01:55:04,833
When that girl grows up

1680
01:55:05,041 --> 01:55:07,583
if some chap like me
elopes with her

1681
01:55:07,708 --> 01:55:09,375
won't her parents
feel terrible?

1682
01:55:14,625 --> 01:55:18,416
Your parents must be
feeling the same, right?

1683
01:55:26,833 --> 01:55:28,625
What we are doing is wrong.

1684
01:55:30,500 --> 01:55:33,250
Let's go.
- My dad will kill you.

1685
01:55:33,541 --> 01:55:34,583
Let's go.

1686
01:55:38,250 --> 01:55:39,375
Raju!

1687
01:55:41,083 --> 01:55:42,250
Don't..

1688
01:55:42,791 --> 01:55:44,125
Raju!

1689
01:55:50,916 --> 01:55:54,208
It's obvious that she'll be angry
if we hit her lover.

1690
01:55:57,666 --> 01:55:59,041
They are both eloping.

1691
01:55:59,166 --> 01:56:00,666
She is his fiancee.

1692
01:56:00,791 --> 01:56:04,958
If I pinch her waist
he'll go berserk.

1693
01:56:06,208 --> 01:56:07,375
Watch this.

1694
01:56:07,666 --> 01:56:09,458
He'll go bonkers.

1695
01:56:10,041 --> 01:56:13,666
If I kiss his bride
in front of his eyes..

1696
01:56:14,375 --> 01:56:15,583
Won't he get mad?

1697
01:56:32,500 --> 01:56:33,958
I'm not angry.

1698
01:56:34,500 --> 01:56:36,083
My mind has acquired clarity.

1699
01:56:36,416 --> 01:56:42,166
You'll remember my blows
till your heartbeat stops.

1700
01:56:45,333 --> 01:56:47,166
Brother, don't.

1701
01:56:55,416 --> 01:56:57,666
Why all this build up?

1702
01:56:58,208 --> 01:56:59,458
Come and fight.

1703
01:57:46,958 --> 01:57:51,083
"High voltage wire.."

1704
01:57:53,250 --> 01:57:57,500
"High voltage wire.."

1705
01:57:58,333 --> 01:57:59,500
Come on.

1706
01:58:15,541 --> 01:58:17,208
Let go of me.

1707
01:58:29,458 --> 01:58:33,916
"High voltage wire.."

1708
01:58:35,625 --> 01:58:40,208
"High voltage wire.."

1709
01:58:49,291 --> 01:58:50,791
Raju!

1710
01:58:56,541 --> 01:58:58,541
Raju?

1711
01:59:37,791 --> 01:59:39,916
He isn't taking me
away from you, dad.

1712
01:59:40,666 --> 01:59:43,375
He's bringing me back to you.

1713
01:59:46,583 --> 01:59:48,125
We realized our mistake

1714
01:59:48,791 --> 01:59:50,041
so we are coming back.

1715
01:59:52,125 --> 01:59:55,750
When a dad finds out that
his daughter is in love

1716
01:59:55,875 --> 01:59:58,625
he usually threatens
to kill her or himself.

1717
01:59:58,750 --> 02:00:01,750
He doesn't check on the family
background or character of the boy.

1718
02:00:01,875 --> 02:00:03,458
He doesn't realize

1719
02:00:03,583 --> 02:00:06,500
that what really matters is
his daughter's happiness.

1720
02:00:08,583 --> 02:00:10,750
How many parents do this, sir?

1721
02:00:12,291 --> 02:00:14,916
Sir, if only parents
give a tiny assurance

1722
02:00:15,041 --> 02:00:17,791
that they won't obstruct the path
of lovers, that's enough.

1723
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,166
No one will elope
in this world, sir.

1724
02:00:23,500 --> 02:00:29,208
It is your duty as a father to
get your daughter happily married.

1725
02:00:29,875 --> 02:00:31,916
But being in love
with her, for me..

1726
02:00:33,541 --> 02:00:34,916
She is my life.

1727
02:00:36,708 --> 02:00:38,375
We've understood
your feelings.

1728
02:00:39,291 --> 02:00:43,916
If you also understand
what we feel for each other

1729
02:00:45,125 --> 02:00:48,291
and get us married, we will
be very happy, sir. Please!

1730
02:00:53,916 --> 02:00:55,041
Hello!

1731
02:00:57,083 --> 02:00:58,666
Driver, turn around.
Go back.

1732
02:01:07,166 --> 02:01:08,916
Move aside.

1733
02:01:09,541 --> 02:01:10,791
Give way.

1734
02:01:13,708 --> 02:01:15,750
Hi, sir.
I'm here.

1735
02:01:15,875 --> 02:01:18,583
He has tarnished
my family's image.

1736
02:01:18,958 --> 02:01:21,250
My ears! Why did you get me
into this mess now?

1737
02:01:21,375 --> 02:01:22,500
What's all this, sir?

1738
02:01:22,625 --> 02:01:23,625
You said you killed him.

1739
02:01:23,750 --> 02:01:24,958
He wanted to kill us.

1740
02:01:25,083 --> 02:01:26,875
But is it that easy
to kill one's daughter?

1741
02:01:27,083 --> 02:01:28,333
Tell us what happened, sir.

1742
02:01:28,541 --> 02:01:30,291
Uncle, tell us
the remaining story.

1743
02:01:30,625 --> 02:01:31,833
That night, they both
walked towards me.

1744
02:01:36,125 --> 02:01:38,250
<i>Doesn't look like
you will change, sir.</i>

1745
02:01:39,333 --> 02:01:41,791
<i>I'll never show
my face to you.</i>

1746
02:01:42,416 --> 02:01:43,625
<i>See you.</i>

1747
02:01:47,791 --> 02:01:49,750
<i>Hey! Stop.</i>

1748
02:01:50,458 --> 02:01:52,125
<i>You'll take my daughter
and then bring her back</i>

1749
02:01:52,250 --> 02:01:54,166
<i>as and when you fancy.</i>

1750
02:01:54,708 --> 02:01:56,125
<i>You think only you can change!</i>

1751
02:01:56,333 --> 02:01:57,875
<i>Won't we change?</i>

1752
02:01:59,250 --> 02:02:00,958
<i>We can also change
our opinions.</i>

1753
02:02:02,291 --> 02:02:06,958
<i>What do I achieve by forcing her
to marry a groom she doesn't like?</i>

1754
02:02:08,083 --> 02:02:11,541
<i>So I thought, even if I lost
my daughter should win.</i>

1755
02:02:11,791 --> 02:02:14,500
<i>That's why I decided
to help her elope.</i>

1756
02:02:15,250 --> 02:02:16,708
<i>Not just that.</i>

1757
02:02:17,333 --> 02:02:21,750
<i>I even propped up the ladder
for her to jump over the wall!</i>

1758
02:02:22,458 --> 02:02:24,583
<i>They were running away
on the spur of the moment</i>

1759
02:02:24,708 --> 02:02:26,416
<i>not knowing
whether they had money.</i>

1760
02:02:26,541 --> 02:02:29,291
<i>I took Rs. 100000
and gave it to them.</i>

1761
02:02:30,625 --> 02:02:34,291
<i>I was waiting for someone to
raise the alarm that she was missing.</i>

1762
02:02:34,416 --> 02:02:37,000
<i>My girl is missing.</i>

1763
02:02:43,625 --> 02:02:47,125
<i>I pretended to take the gun out
in anger, to kill you.</i>

1764
02:02:47,750 --> 02:02:50,416
<i>But my actual intention
was to bless you both.</i>

1765
02:02:51,208 --> 02:02:54,125
<i>Even if you had known it or not</i>

1766
02:02:55,291 --> 02:02:58,083
<i>I would've done the same.</i>

1767
02:02:59,625 --> 02:03:04,583
<i>Now that I am here,
let me prove</i>

1768
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:06,875
<i>that I mean it.</i>

1769
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:09,916
<i>Take this cash and
run away from here.</i>

1770
02:03:10,916 --> 02:03:13,041
<i>Why should we run away
when you like me now?</i>

1771
02:03:13,166 --> 02:03:16,083
<i>We can invite the whole town
and get married in style.</i>

1772
02:03:16,208 --> 02:03:17,833
<i>You can say that!</i>

1773
02:03:17,958 --> 02:03:19,583
<i>I don't even fear God.</i>

1774
02:03:19,708 --> 02:03:22,166
<i>But the very thought
of Veeraraju</i>

1775
02:03:23,041 --> 02:03:24,625
<i>makes me shiver.</i>

1776
02:03:25,250 --> 02:03:27,250
<i>Is your wedding important
for you, or my ears?</i>

1777
02:03:27,458 --> 02:03:29,458
Wedding..
- Ears are a priority for me.

1778
02:03:29,583 --> 02:03:31,500
You both may sneak out now.

1779
02:03:31,625 --> 02:03:35,208
I'll go back with a build up
that I killed you both in a frenzy.

1780
02:03:36,083 --> 02:03:37,958
For the sake of a wager

1781
02:03:38,083 --> 02:03:41,666
Sivarama Raju killed his own daughter.
May he live long!

1782
02:03:41,791 --> 02:03:45,625
Veeraraju and everyone believed
my story that I killed you.

1783
02:03:46,958 --> 02:03:48,458
This is what happened.

1784
02:03:49,083 --> 02:03:51,916
Oh God! He has fainted.
Is there any hospital nearby?

1785
02:03:52,041 --> 02:03:53,875
Good news for you,
my dear father-in-law.

1786
02:03:54,125 --> 02:03:55,750
Your daughter
is expecting a baby.

1787
02:03:55,875 --> 02:03:57,583
You will soon be a grandfather.

1788
02:04:02,041 --> 02:04:03,083
All this is fine

1789
02:04:03,291 --> 02:04:05,250
but if Veeraraju knows
you are back

1790
02:04:05,458 --> 02:04:07,875
what about my ears?

1791
02:04:17,375 --> 02:04:18,875
Forgive me,
Mr. Sivarama Raju.

1792
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:21,916
I derided girls and
provoked you unnecessarily.

1793
02:04:22,041 --> 02:04:25,875
Do you know how upset I was
thinking you killed your daughter?

1794
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:29,625
Whatever it is, you've found
a son-in-law who's a dynamite.

1795
02:04:29,750 --> 02:04:32,625
"High voltage wire."

1796
02:04:32,750 --> 02:04:35,875
"High voltage wire."

1797
02:04:37,958 --> 02:04:39,958
"Victorious in war
with his super power.."

1798
02:04:40,083 --> 02:04:41,750
"Battles he won
brave as a lion.."

1799
02:04:41,875 --> 02:04:43,708
"Beat the drums to sync
with his song and sing.."

1800
02:04:43,833 --> 02:04:45,625
"Watch this VIP
walking elegantly.."

1801
02:04:45,750 --> 02:04:47,541
"Victorious in war
with his super power.."

1802
02:04:47,666 --> 02:04:49,458
"Battles he won
as brave as a lion.."

1803
02:04:49,583 --> 02:04:51,208
"Beat the drums to sync
with his tune and sing.."

1804
02:04:51,333 --> 02:04:53,166
"Watch this VIP
walking elegantly.."

1805
02:04:53,291 --> 02:04:55,000
"He pounced with flair
making the ground tremor.."

1806
02:04:55,125 --> 02:04:56,958
"He matched his moves
with talent in all respects.."

1807
02:04:57,083 --> 02:04:59,041
"This handsome dude
is a local star of repute.."

1808
02:04:59,166 --> 02:05:01,958
<i>Sir. Let's shake hands."</i>

1809
02:05:06,708 --> 02:05:08,666
<i>You said 'cut' as soon as
she kissed.</i>

1810
02:05:13,500 --> 02:05:16,666
<i>My letter.. I don't know what to say..</i>

1811
02:05:18,125 --> 02:05:20,291
<i>Here I go..
- Wait!</i>

1812
02:05:24,458 --> 02:05:28,666
"Ladies and gentlemen..
Hello everyone!"

1813
02:05:31,375 --> 02:05:34,041
<i>No one drinks these days
because they are dumped.</i>

1814
02:05:34,166 --> 02:05:37,166
<i>They drink only because they are
wondering how to hook the next girl!</i>

1815
02:05:37,291 --> 02:05:42,541
"Be careful if you touch me
you'll find yourself in difficulty."

1816
02:05:44,375 --> 02:05:48,250
"If I look, there are fireworks.."

1817
02:05:48,375 --> 02:05:52,250
"You can't find the right rival
even if you search in Google."

1818
02:05:52,375 --> 02:05:55,958
"I'm in fact equivalent
to an electric current."

1819
02:05:56,083 --> 02:05:59,916
"If you switch on your power
watch out, you're in danger!"

1820
02:06:00,083 --> 02:06:02,958
<i>You'll all be advised
for a bed rest for sure.</i>

1821
02:06:03,083 --> 02:06:06,833
"I am in fact equivalent
to electric current."

1822
02:06:06,958 --> 02:06:10,958
"If you provoke me unnecessarily,
I shall bring the universe down."

1823
02:06:33,125 --> 02:06:37,375
"I won't button up my shirt..
I'll raise my collar and roam."

1824
02:06:37,500 --> 02:06:41,000
"If anyone acts like a rowdy..
I'll shatter their ribs bloody."

1825
02:06:41,125 --> 02:06:44,750
"A cynosure of all eyes..
Just a golden hearted guy."

1826
02:06:44,875 --> 02:06:48,666
"If you cross my path, you won't find
even calcium in your bones left behind."

1827
02:06:48,791 --> 02:06:52,416
"Caste! My blood doesn't discriminate..
Religion! My mind doesn't differentiate.."

1828
02:06:52,541 --> 02:06:55,958
"I am not a boy ordinary..
Underline this, compulsory!"

1829
02:06:57,125 --> 02:07:01,791
<i>Yes!
"I am in fact equivalent to electric current."</i>

1830
02:07:01,958 --> 02:07:05,666
"If you switch on your power,
you'll be in danger!"

1831
02:07:05,791 --> 02:07:09,416
"I am in fact equivalent
to electric current."

1832
02:07:09,541 --> 02:07:13,291
"If you provoke me unnecessarily,
I shall bring the universe down."

1833
02:07:32,833 --> 02:07:35,500
<i>Beware..</i>

1834
02:07:35,666 --> 02:07:37,958
<i>Say 'hi'.
And leave. - Okay.</i>

1835
02:07:38,750 --> 02:07:41,333
<i>This letter is for the teacher..
- Okay..</i>

1836
02:07:41,458 --> 02:07:44,791
<i>The love letter must be..</i>

1837
02:07:46,375 --> 02:07:50,291
"Branded as a boy who's playful..
And a scoundrel who's sinful."

1838
02:07:50,416 --> 02:07:54,083
"If I'm maligned so by the townsfolk..
I'll ignore and treat it as a bad joke."

1839
02:07:54,208 --> 02:07:57,833
"Heart in my broad chest nestled..
And the courage it holds unrivalled."

1840
02:07:57,958 --> 02:08:01,500
"Trusting thoughts lodged in my brain..
I'll make my exit without any pain."

1841
02:08:01,625 --> 02:08:05,250
"I won't be ordered by anyone surely
nor let anyone get the better of me."

1842
02:08:05,375 --> 02:08:08,833
"If any risk I'm forced to face,
I'll cover up with ease always."

1843
02:08:08,958 --> 02:08:12,750
"I'm in fact equivalent
to electric current."

1844
02:08:12,875 --> 02:08:16,541
"If you switch on your power,
you'll be in danger!"

1845
02:08:16,666 --> 02:08:20,291
"I'm in fact equivalent
to electric current."

1846
02:08:20,416 --> 02:08:24,083
"If you provoke me unnecessarily,
I shall bring the universe down."

1847
02:08:24,208 --> 02:08:27,583
"I am in fact equivalent
to electric current."

1848
02:08:27,916 --> 02:08:31,500
"If you switch on your power,
you'll be in danger!"

1849
02:08:31,625 --> 02:08:35,416
"I am in fact equivalent
to electric current."

1850
02:08:35,541 --> 02:08:40,375
"If you provoke me unnecessarily,
I shall bring the universe down."
