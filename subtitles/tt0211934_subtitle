1
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:13,838
As the Governor of Goa,
it gives me pride to say...

2
00:01:13,973 --> 00:01:16,771
that our Chief Minister,
Madam Gayatri Bachchan...

3
00:01:16,976 --> 00:01:19,444
is a mother-figure for people
of this state.

4
00:01:19,779 --> 00:01:22,441
Politicians normally build big,
palatial houses for themselves...

5
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:24,446
once they become chief ministers.

6
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:26,949
Whereas, she has donated her
own palace to the nation.

7
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:37,454
l inherited this palace from my
father, Maharaja Virendra Singh.

8
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:41,467
But l believe that only the nation
has a right...

9
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:45,464
to the holdings of princes
and maharajas.

10
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:53,468
You're not only the lady's husband,
but the president of the party, too.

11
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:55,474
Would you like to say
something too?

12
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:02,310
All l will say is that
l'm proud of my wife.

13
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:09,893
Madam gives you 10 minutes,
Mr Thapar. Please follow me.

14
00:02:15,835 --> 00:02:19,498
Good morning, Chief Minister.
- Good morning. Please come.

15
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:29,906
l haven't been able to sleep...

16
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,519
ever since that accident
took place in my factory.

17
00:02:35,555 --> 00:02:38,922
l'm terribly worried about the
families of those killed.

18
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,923
So l've decided. lf l've got to
do something for them...

19
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:47,533
l must strengthen your hands.

20
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:49,534
And what do you want in return?

21
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:53,202
You have appointed a commission of
enquiry against Thapar Chemicals.

22
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:55,938
lf you could withdraw that...

23
00:02:57,577 --> 00:03:02,810
l'm willing to pay any price.
- How much?

24
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:07,214
100 million?
- ls that all?

25
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:11,216
200 million?
- 400 million.

26
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:16,050
All right. 400 million.

27
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:19,963
l'll pay you 400 million.
- Pardon me?

28
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:28,234
ln return, you will give me
an arm, a leg and an eye.

29
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:31,568
What are you saying?
- Why not?

30
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:35,578
You're not willing to sell
any part of your body.

31
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:38,975
And you're here to buy the
death of 500 workers...

32
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:41,586
who died of poisonous gases
in your chemical factory.

33
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:43,988
That was not an accident!

34
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:47,581
lt was the outcome of
using sub-standard machinery.

35
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:49,093
And you are responsible
for that.

36
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:52,597
l will not only have your
factory closed down...

37
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:57,000
l'll bring a case against you
for killing 500 men!

38
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:01,001
l'll have a bill passed in the
next session of our Assembly.

39
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,608
l will make sure that all your
chemical factories are closed down!

40
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:12,015
Gayatri Bachchan will have to be
removed from the C.M.'s chair.

41
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:15,617
No. Gayatri Bachchan is not
merely the Chief Minister of Goa.

42
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:19,024
She is also a mother to the
people of this state.

43
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:23,023
None of her MLAs will revolt
against her.

44
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:29,033
The ballot is therefore not the way
to eliminate her. The bullet is.

45
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:34,630
There isn't a soul in Goa who
will cast his ballot against her.

46
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:37,267
Who would fire a
bullet at her?

47
00:04:38,511 --> 00:04:39,808
l will.

48
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:43,778
But it will take some time.

49
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:47,145
There are many professional
killers in Mumbai...

50
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:50,656
who'd assassinate anyone
for the money.

51
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:57,060
All right.
Leave for Mumbai today, Rani.

52
00:04:57,697 --> 00:05:01,861
And give the contract to a man
who can do the job for us.

53
00:05:07,106 --> 00:05:09,074
Don't let anyone smoke in here.

54
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:25,081
What do you do to guys who go
on rampage and break up things?

55
00:05:25,224 --> 00:05:28,682
We have 4 bouncers here to
break those guys up. Take a look!

56
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:35,701
That's a whole lot of meat!

57
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:40,103
Who are you?
- Have you heard of godfather?

58
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:42,374
l'm not the Godfather.

59
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:46,109
Have you heard of Godfather ll?

60
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:48,714
l'm not that either.

61
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:52,115
Have you heard of god-friend?
- No.

62
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:54,117
That's me.

63
00:05:56,622 --> 00:05:59,113
So you are here to gamble!
- l won't be gambling.

64
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:04,128
Godfather will.
- Godfather will? But when?

65
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:07,126
At exactly 8 p.m.
- At eight?!

66
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:52,829
This is a gambling-den, sir.
What are we here for?

67
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:56,241
Someone stole my diamonds worth

68
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:59,242
l'll be getting them here today.
- How?

69
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:02,236
l've entrusted the case to Badshah,
a private detective.

70
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:04,850
He has called me here.

71
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:14,250
Who's that in your car?
- He's the CEO of my company.

72
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:17,851
Have you found my diamonds?
- Don't worry, sir.

73
00:08:18,397 --> 00:08:20,262
They're busy working
for you upstairs.

74
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:28,373
Smoking is not allowed.

75
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:47,290
Who's he?
- He's the manager.

76
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:51,897
Which table would you
like to gamble at?

77
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:06,912
But that's a no-limits table!

78
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:10,916
My boss has no limits to
anything he does, okay?

79
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:14,317
Didn't l tell you, sir?
He's a nut... let's go!

80
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:21,586
Would you like to
make some more money?

81
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:23,929
Sit down.

82
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:39,342
A new hand. And new cards.

83
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:46,941
Your turn.

84
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:14,602
Come home some day to
learn the ropes!

85
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:57,181
My stakes.

86
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:40,055
Could we have a loan please?

87
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:42,461
You'll get it back when
the bank opens tomorrow.

88
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:47,467
This isn't for kids!
Go home, if your dough is over!

89
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:48,463
Hold it.

90
00:12:00,786 --> 00:12:03,755
Each of these diamonds
is worth 200,000.

91
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:10,720
Here's my 400,000

92
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:15,496
What did you say?
This isn't for kids, eh?

93
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:20,767
Here's a tenner. To pay for
your rickshaw ride, back home!

94
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:30,115
Wait.

95
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:35,511
Don't give up.
l'll take over the game.

96
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:38,415
You'll get your money back.

97
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:48,133
So what is the stake?

98
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:51,796
Two diamonds.
l mean 400,000.

99
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:07,151
Each of these diamonds
is worth 200,000 too.

100
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,545
Here's my stake. 800,000.

101
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:13,223
Uncle... l hope they're
really diamonds?

102
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:17,553
Can't you see? He has decency
written all over his face.

103
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:20,993
Your moustache tells me
you're not a cheat.

104
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:26,831
Not 800,000. Here comes
my stake of 1 , 600,000.

105
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:30,801
1 ,600,000, eh?
- That's right.

106
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:43,019
l said ''show''...
l asked for a show.

107
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:47,522
You didn't hear it...
He asked for a show.

108
00:13:50,796 --> 00:13:57,599
A Jack. The second Jack.
And here's the third.

109
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:28,562
Where did the third king
spring from?

110
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:31,634
He's the King who has kings.
No jacks, you know.

111
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:35,638
His third card was a six!
l saw it in your glasses!

112
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:40,245
The glasses, eh?
Show him your glasses, Ramlal.

113
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:44,640
These glasses?
They're meant for casinos!

114
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:49,643
Buy one now!
l carry so many with me!

115
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:53,656
So you guys have fooled me!
- Why must we fool you?

116
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:55,590
You are already a fool!

117
00:14:56,595 --> 00:14:58,256
Let's go, Ramlal.
- Hold it!

118
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:02,259
Ever heard of Manikchand?
- Sure. The tobacco we spit out!

119
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:06,532
Sure, we've heard...
please lower the gun!

120
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:10,275
Let's talk it over...
You can have the money.

121
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:12,273
You can have my watch, too!
An expensive one.

122
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:15,675
Here are my glasses. ln fact,
you can have my clothes, too...

123
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,815
lt works less and shows off more!
l'll put it away, okay?

124
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:26,689
Relax... this is a finger!
Lower your hands!

125
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:34,697
l don't only show it off!
l can use it, too!

126
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:38,303
Get cracking, Ramlal.
Gather the money.

127
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:04,728
Don't worry, sir. You will
certainly get your diamonds.

128
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:21,746
Hey, wait... hold on!

129
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:41,194
Bravo! Give me the diamonds!
- Here you are.

130
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,300
Old man... he's our man!

131
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:47,366
So you guys are
into this together!

132
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:05,389
Brother-in-law!

133
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:08,791
What's happening here?
Where are the diamonds?

134
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:11,794
l tried to gamble with them.
- And so?

135
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:15,388
Badshah, the gambler, conned me.
He's taken away the diamonds!

136
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:19,804
Badshah is not a gambler!
He's a detective!

137
00:17:20,072 --> 00:17:25,408
The moneybags had hired him to
retrieve the diamonds l'd stolen!

138
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:28,406
Don't you worry, brother-in-law!

139
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:32,808
Forget Badshah! Not even
a bird can escape this place!

140
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:43,826
He's right behind us!

141
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:49,833
lt's just a body, boss!
- Look at the face, guys!

142
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:54,837
But it doesn't have a face!
- Of course, there is a face!

143
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:59,842
There is no face, boss!
- There is a face, l say!

144
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:04,448
There is a bloody face!

145
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:09,443
You've gone crazy, boss!
You're imagining things!

146
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:12,450
We don't want to work for you!
- You're always hitting us!

147
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:14,454
Hey, listen...

148
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:17,318
Here he is!

149
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:37,881
Now look, doggie...
l'm scared of dogs, you know.

150
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:40,476
One moment...

151
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:54,490
Badshah will arrive before
the count of eight.

152
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:56,159
Here he is.

153
00:18:57,536 --> 00:19:00,505
Sorry, mister. l've arrived
five seconds early.

154
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:03,505
Here you are.
Diamonds worth 8 million.

155
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:07,512
And here's your 5 million
in cash.

156
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:12,517
This is Ramlal.
My chief assistant.

157
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:17,920
He'll come to you tomorrow.
Please pay him my fees.

158
00:24:57,729 --> 00:25:02,257
Don't worry about the expenses!
Your husband was my friend.

159
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,267
And Badshah called to tell me
about your difficulties.

160
00:25:05,971 --> 00:25:09,372
No. l don't want to be operated.
l can see everything!

161
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:17,277
l last saw Badshah when he was
a kid. He must've grown up now.

162
00:25:17,415 --> 00:25:20,282
Where can l find him?
- He must be in The office.

163
00:25:20,418 --> 00:25:21,885
And where is his office?

164
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:24,882
There's this lane, you see...
don't take that.

165
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:28,283
Don't take the lane
beside that one, either.

166
00:25:28,426 --> 00:25:32,294
Walk straight and you'll come
across another lane.

167
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:35,297
Don't take that lane too.
- l understand. l take no lanes!

168
00:25:35,433 --> 00:25:37,731
l'll find Badshah on my own.
Good-bye.

169
00:25:39,237 --> 00:25:41,296
All that stuff that
gets in the way!

170
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:46,308
Who's the blind man?
- He's a renowned eye specialist!

171
00:25:46,945 --> 00:25:49,311
My God! Finding Badshah
is indeed very difficult.

172
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:52,311
Well? What brings you here?

173
00:25:52,951 --> 00:25:54,919
lt's your darling son, Badshah!

174
00:25:55,954 --> 00:25:59,913
l had great respect for
your husband, Mr Ganpatrai.

175
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:02,920
He had goodwill in
the police force.

176
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:05,930
And that is exactly why
l've been quiet.

177
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:08,329
Or else, l'd have the licence of
his detective agency cancelled!

178
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:11,333
He's driven the entire
police department crazy!

179
00:26:16,374 --> 00:26:17,932
This bag is empty!

180
00:26:18,276 --> 00:26:20,335
Where's the money, Ramlal?
Did you lose it?

181
00:26:20,478 --> 00:26:21,945
lt sunk.
- How?

182
00:26:22,981 --> 00:26:23,948
l'll explain.

183
00:26:24,983 --> 00:26:27,952
We broke the gambling table, right?
l paid 10 grand for that.

184
00:26:28,987 --> 00:26:30,955
2 chairs we wrecked;
that's another 2000.

185
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:33,351
That's 12000. Where's the rest?
- 2 cut-glass ash-trays...

186
00:26:33,491 --> 00:26:35,356
worth 900 bucks.
- That's 12900. And the rest?

187
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:37,358
We shattered the chandelier.
That was worth 20 grand.

188
00:26:37,495 --> 00:26:40,953
32,900... where's the rest?
- Another 1000 for small breakage.

189
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:43,361
That's 33,900... where's the rest?
- The rest, eh?

190
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:46,368
You jumped through the glass pane
like Superman, didn't you?

191
00:26:46,504 --> 00:26:49,371
lt was imported stuff.
l've paid 15500 for that!

192
00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:52,374
Why did you have to break
such expensive glass?

193
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:55,377
You could've taken the staircase!
- l'm not fond of jumping either!

194
00:26:55,513 --> 00:26:56,980
There was a dog chasing me!

195
00:26:58,016 --> 00:27:00,382
You must still have 600 Rupees.
lsn't it, Ramlal?

196
00:27:00,518 --> 00:27:04,386
See what l'm wearing? l could
have walked here in the nude!

197
00:27:05,023 --> 00:27:06,991
l've paid 500 bucks
for the hired clothes!

198
00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:08,992
And here's a hundred rupees.
Keep it.

199
00:27:13,598 --> 00:27:15,998
Never mind!
There's no reason to worry!

200
00:27:16,101 --> 00:27:19,400
Today's newspapers have carried
headlines of our exploits!

201
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:21,403
When people read that...

202
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:24,997
we'll have a queue of clients
in front of our office!

203
00:27:26,044 --> 00:27:27,409
There it is!

204
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:33,013
Where is Badshah's office?
- Up there.

205
00:27:33,251 --> 00:27:37,415
Really? l've been through this place
four times. And nobody told me!

206
00:27:46,064 --> 00:27:47,691
Wow! An automatic entrance!

207
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:53,435
lt even shuts on its own!

208
00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:55,539
Get on with the signals!

209
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:07,449
Hey mister! Where's the
paper in the typewriter?

210
00:28:08,586 --> 00:28:11,453
This is an automatic set-up.
- Everything here is automatic!

211
00:28:16,127 --> 00:28:19,790
Badshah works here, isn't it?
Where can l find him?

212
00:28:20,498 --> 00:28:23,058
Badshah does not work here.
He owns this place.

213
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:26,461
Owns it? But where can l find him?
- Sit down.

214
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:30,472
That chair, idiot! Not this one!
- You are an idiot!

215
00:28:36,614 --> 00:28:39,742
Are you Badshah?
- Me ?!

216
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:44,487
When Badshah arrives,
there is a storm!

217
00:28:44,622 --> 00:28:47,489
There is thunder!
And the clouds rumble!

218
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:50,492
The earth trembles,
you burden-on-earth!

219
00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:08,112
Go back in there... go!

220
00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:20,522
How are you, Mr Tata?

221
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:23,525
l have great respect for you, sir.

222
00:29:25,163 --> 00:29:27,529
But l can't accept this case
of your ship's theft.

223
00:29:27,699 --> 00:29:31,135
The Birlas and Ambanis are already
in the waiting list, you see.

224
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:36,129
As for Kirloskar! He has made life
miserable for me, sir!

225
00:29:36,674 --> 00:29:39,541
Are you tempting me with money,
Mr Tata?

226
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:44,145
You don't know!
l possess millions too!

227
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:50,978
Tell Tata l'm not in,
if he calls again.

228
00:29:53,691 --> 00:29:56,558
There was a call from
Clint Eastwood...

229
00:29:56,694 --> 00:29:58,821
secretary to Mr Bill Clinton
of America.

230
00:29:59,197 --> 00:30:02,166
He says someone has stolen
their atom-bomb.

231
00:30:02,367 --> 00:30:05,564
They're willing to pay a million
dollars to detect the crime.

232
00:30:09,207 --> 00:30:10,674
You know my principles.

233
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:14,678
First come... first hauled.
Up here!

234
00:30:16,214 --> 00:30:21,584
Hey! What the hell are you doing?
Set me down!

235
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:25,587
Put your secret signature
on these secret documents.

236
00:30:35,066 --> 00:30:36,260
Where did you sign it?

237
00:30:37,635 --> 00:30:39,034
That's a secret signature!

238
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:47,602
Well? What's your problem?

239
00:30:47,745 --> 00:30:50,612
The operation is necessary.
But mother refuses.

240
00:30:51,249 --> 00:30:54,218
Mother will have to be convinced.
- Right!

241
00:30:55,253 --> 00:30:57,619
How old is mother?
- Should be around 50.

242
00:30:58,256 --> 00:30:59,723
How about you?
- l'm 55.

243
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:05,218
lnteresting. His mother's 50.
And he, the son, is 55!

244
00:31:05,763 --> 00:31:08,231
l'm talking about your mom,
you ass!

245
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,632
My mom?!

246
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:11,632
Didn't you call me this morning?

247
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:15,637
Are you doctor Rustom?
- Correct!

248
00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:18,635
He was crying and begging me
this morning!

249
00:31:18,776 --> 00:31:22,234
He said he'd pay the cost of
the operation in installments!

250
00:31:22,447 --> 00:31:25,644
And you guys are dealing
in millions of dollars!

251
00:31:25,783 --> 00:31:28,650
You want a free operation, eh?
l will not do it!

252
00:31:29,621 --> 00:31:31,418
Where is he?
- l'm here, doctor!

253
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:33,648
Down...!
- We've made a mistake!

254
00:31:33,791 --> 00:31:35,656
We thought you're a client!
- Down, l say!

255
00:31:35,827 --> 00:31:38,261
That talk of millions...
this office... it's all false!

256
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:40,261
Down!
- Set him down, damn it!

257
00:31:45,303 --> 00:31:47,669
Forgive me, doctor!
Please!

258
00:31:47,805 --> 00:31:51,673
Please operate on my mother!
- l'm a hot-headed man!

259
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:55,279
l'll think about it
when l've cooled down!

260
00:31:58,316 --> 00:32:01,285
What's going on?
l won't spare you today!

261
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,685
Where are you going?!

262
00:32:06,824 --> 00:32:09,691
Not here in the office, mom!
These guys respect me!

263
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:13,962
And you guys let him talk you
into turning detectives, eh?!

264
00:32:14,165 --> 00:32:15,860
l won't let you guys
get away today!

265
00:32:16,334 --> 00:32:20,134
Everyone in Ganpatrai's family is mad!
She does need the operation!

266
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:26,709
l'm going to exorcise you of this
evil detective spirit today!

267
00:32:27,345 --> 00:32:29,313
l'm going to make a
constable out of you!

268
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:31,812
You want me to be a big man, right?
- Yes.

269
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:33,977
You want me to succeed?
- Yes.

270
00:32:34,185 --> 00:32:35,709
Dad wanted that too?
- Yes.

271
00:32:35,853 --> 00:32:37,718
Give me 2 more months.

272
00:32:37,855 --> 00:32:41,313
lf l don't make it in these

273
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:47,327
l'll even be a guard,
if you ask me to!

274
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:50,725
l'd even be a sweeper for you!
Really, mom!

275
00:32:50,868 --> 00:32:53,336
All right.
Now come home and eat.

276
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:55,734
Sure, l will. You're so
lovingly asking me too.

277
00:32:57,709 --> 00:33:00,678
Where are those wastrels?

278
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:03,347
Here we are!

279
00:33:17,395 --> 00:33:19,192
That's 10 million in advance.

280
00:33:19,397 --> 00:33:21,024
The rest you will get after
you've finished the job.

281
00:33:23,401 --> 00:33:26,370
Goa's Chief Minister.
Gayatri Bachchan.

282
00:33:27,905 --> 00:33:29,202
The place?

283
00:33:29,574 --> 00:33:31,769
During an inauguration of
a home for the aged.

284
00:33:32,043 --> 00:33:35,376
Here's a VlP pass to
see you through.

285
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:40,180
That'll only see me through.
How do l carry my weapon?

286
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:42,544
This is the Chief Security Officer.
He will help you.

287
00:33:43,821 --> 00:33:47,780
The function is on the 26th of
September. A fortnight from now.

288
00:33:50,428 --> 00:33:51,895
26th of September?

289
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:56,791
Which means we must do
something by the 24th.

290
00:33:57,435 --> 00:33:59,403
And who will do it for us?

291
00:34:01,439 --> 00:34:03,407
The Badshah Detective Agency?

292
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:16,811
Looks like a client is coming here.
- And he looks loaded!

293
00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:18,750
There it is.

294
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:32,434
lmpossible, sir...
We don't have the time.

295
00:34:34,972 --> 00:34:37,065
Are you Mr Badshah?

296
00:34:37,442 --> 00:34:41,435
Please wait. Mr Badshah is
solving a secret case.

297
00:34:41,712 --> 00:34:44,237
This is very important.

298
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:50,853
Contact Mr Badshah immediately.
Somebody wants to meet him.

299
00:35:04,001 --> 00:35:06,868
Dhirubhai! You mustn't worry!

300
00:35:08,005 --> 00:35:12,806
We have located your ship that
was hijacked on the high-seas.

301
00:35:13,744 --> 00:35:15,609
lt's lying in our stores!

302
00:35:16,013 --> 00:35:18,140
Just send the payment and have it
delivered to you.

303
00:35:19,517 --> 00:35:23,886
And how is your wife, by the way?
Fine? That's good.

304
00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:25,884
Don't you forget me, okay?

305
00:35:34,832 --> 00:35:36,891
How did you know my name?

306
00:35:37,034 --> 00:35:39,901
You're wearing a bracelet
on your left hand.

307
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:44,907
lt carries the legend:
K. Jhunjhunwala

308
00:35:45,042 --> 00:35:46,509
Sit down.

309
00:35:47,545 --> 00:35:49,513
Well? What is it?

310
00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:55,314
This is my daughter, Seema.

311
00:35:57,555 --> 00:35:59,523
l want to get her married.

312
00:36:04,562 --> 00:36:07,929
She's beautiful.
And l don't mind.

313
00:36:10,234 --> 00:36:16,173
But you'd have to talk to
my mother about this.

314
00:36:16,574 --> 00:36:19,543
You misunderstand.
l've already found a match for her.

315
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:25,879
This is Nitin Dharampal.
My late friend's son.

316
00:36:26,584 --> 00:36:32,352
l get it! You want your daughter
to marry him. Right?

317
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,954
That's right.
- So find a priest.

318
00:36:35,092 --> 00:36:36,957
What are you doing here?

319
00:36:37,595 --> 00:36:40,962
My daughter is obsessed with the
idea of finding her own husband.

320
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:45,558
She likes Nitin, all right.
But she doesn't want to marry him.

321
00:36:46,103 --> 00:36:49,971
So why must you force your
daughter into something?

322
00:36:50,241 --> 00:36:53,972
Because l have a tumour
in my brain.

323
00:36:55,846 --> 00:36:56,972
l'm in the last stages.

324
00:36:57,615 --> 00:37:00,982
l'm leaving for America on the 26th
of September. For an operation.

325
00:37:01,819 --> 00:37:04,583
But life can't be trusted.
l could even...

326
00:37:06,624 --> 00:37:07,591
That's enough.

327
00:37:09,126 --> 00:37:11,594
l understand it all,
Mr Jhunjhunwala.

328
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,996
All you want me to do is to...

329
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:19,000
rid your daughter of the obsession
of marrying the man she loves.

330
00:37:19,136 --> 00:37:22,003
That's right.
- Before the 26th then...

331
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:24,004
you want me to get
her married to Nitin.

332
00:37:24,642 --> 00:37:29,011
Exactly. l'll remain grateful
to you all my life.

333
00:37:29,647 --> 00:37:32,616
l'm prepared to pay
any fees you ask for.

334
00:37:33,818 --> 00:37:37,015
lf you need an advance...
- How can you say such things!

335
00:37:37,388 --> 00:37:40,016
Grab it!

336
00:37:41,659 --> 00:37:45,026
A satellite problem here, you see.
But don't worry.

337
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,625
What will your fees be?

338
00:37:48,165 --> 00:37:52,033
What do l say about such
a case, Mr Jhunjhunwala?

339
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:56,037
But still, about 10 thousand...

340
00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:58,639
Ask for more!

341
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:01,645
Pay me 10,000 as an advance...

342
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,648
and the 40,000 when
l complete the assignment.

343
00:38:04,982 --> 00:38:06,472
Very well.

344
00:38:15,693 --> 00:38:17,661
You can relax now, Jhunjhunwala.

345
00:38:18,195 --> 00:38:22,063
You can consider your job done!

346
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,167
May l leave now?
- All right.

347
00:38:24,702 --> 00:38:26,670
Thanks a lot.
- Good-bye!

348
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,800
Here you are. ln full and final.
Relax till our job is done.

349
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:42,430
Will no one suspect us?
- Don't worry. We'll handle that.

350
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,635
lnsolent rascal!
- What happened, madam?

351
00:43:31,842 --> 00:43:33,639
This loafer was only
pretending to dance!

352
00:43:33,844 --> 00:43:37,371
He was making
lewd gestures to me!

353
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:40,982
That's impossible!
The poor chap is blind.

354
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:44,978
My glasses!

355
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:48,990
What rubbish! How was he
dancing if he's blind?

356
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:52,192
How could he prance about, without
being able to see the place?

357
00:43:52,329 --> 00:43:54,991
An artist uses his heart
to look at things, madam.

358
00:43:55,265 --> 00:43:59,395
To earn a living, he has been
dancing and singing here for ages.

359
00:44:00,037 --> 00:44:02,005
He knows every nook and corner
of this place.

360
00:44:02,539 --> 00:44:04,507
You slapped him for no reason.

361
00:44:05,542 --> 00:44:08,409
lt's all right, manager.
Never mind.

362
00:44:09,346 --> 00:44:12,008
Fate itself has dealt me
a severe blow.

363
00:44:12,116 --> 00:44:14,016
What difference does
her slap make?

364
00:44:16,553 --> 00:44:19,420
l'm not the lady...
here she is.

365
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:23,690
You're wearing trousers, madam?
- Yes.

366
00:44:24,061 --> 00:44:26,427
What you did was right, madam.

367
00:44:27,064 --> 00:44:32,434
l have received so much of love
and sympathy from everyone...

368
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:36,437
that l forgot l was blind.

369
00:44:38,075 --> 00:44:41,442
But your slap has
opened my eyes today.

370
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:48,383
You've made me realise that a blind
man is after all, a blind man!

371
00:44:51,388 --> 00:44:55,051
l'm very grateful to you...

372
00:44:56,727 --> 00:44:58,058
Mister...

373
00:45:01,098 --> 00:45:04,465
Your coat?
- Yes. Help Me wear it.

374
00:45:07,104 --> 00:45:09,072
My stick?
- Here it is.

375
00:45:12,609 --> 00:45:14,474
l must leave now.

376
00:45:17,114 --> 00:45:23,485
Can somebody drop me at the
bus-stop? lt's time for my bus.

377
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:27,488
l'll take you there.
- you? Thank you So much.

378
00:45:29,126 --> 00:45:31,094
Good-bye!

379
00:45:32,629 --> 00:45:35,097
He's a very self-respecting man!

380
00:45:35,466 --> 00:45:40,494
He will even starve!
But he will never come here again.

381
00:45:41,138 --> 00:45:43,106
He won't even sing ever again.

382
00:45:56,153 --> 00:45:58,519
Excuse me...
- One moment, sister!

383
00:45:59,156 --> 00:46:04,526
l'm blind. And l've just
been slapped by a girl!

384
00:46:05,562 --> 00:46:08,531
l am the same girl.
- l see!

385
00:46:10,501 --> 00:46:13,129
The girl in the trousers!
- l've made a mistake. l...

386
00:46:13,504 --> 00:46:19,136
No. You have made no mistake!
lt's my blindness that is to blame.

387
00:46:19,476 --> 00:46:22,536
Have you forgiven me?
- of course.

388
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,478
Come on. l'll take you
wherever you wish to go.

389
00:46:27,584 --> 00:46:30,144
How can l refuse...
now that you insist?

390
00:46:30,687 --> 00:46:31,654
Let's go.

391
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:35,158
He's done it!
- What?!

392
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:37,556
He has scored with the girl!
He's bringing her here!

393
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:03,847
This is it! My home is here!

394
00:47:04,221 --> 00:47:07,190
How did you know?

395
00:47:07,524 --> 00:47:10,584
There's a dairy farm around.
lt stinks.

396
00:47:11,528 --> 00:47:14,190
l must leave now.
- No...

397
00:47:14,531 --> 00:47:16,192
You've come all the way.

398
00:47:16,533 --> 00:47:19,195
You must have a cup of tea
in my humble abode.

399
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:22,198
lt's pretty late.
Some other day, perhaps.

400
00:47:22,739 --> 00:47:27,199
All right!
Let's leave it to God!

401
00:47:31,748 --> 00:47:35,047
lt's raining in summer!
- it happens in our locality.

402
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:38,720
Looks like God also wants you
to spend time in my house...

403
00:47:38,822 --> 00:47:42,622
till the rain stops.
Please come with me.

404
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,625
Have you left?
- No...

405
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:54,629
Welcome... to my humble abode!
How fortunate l am!

406
00:47:55,572 --> 00:47:58,632
Careful...
- The house is a mess, l'm sorry.

407
00:47:58,909 --> 00:48:02,072
Let me put these clothes
in the trunk.

408
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:07,649
The books lay strewn around.
Nobody cares for them, you see!

409
00:48:07,918 --> 00:48:11,649
And the umbrella's lying here...
while it's raining outside.

410
00:48:12,623 --> 00:48:14,691
l'm through!
- This is surprising!

411
00:48:14,691 --> 00:48:16,659
You know where to keep everything
without even looking!

412
00:48:16,793 --> 00:48:19,660
There's nothing surprising.
l've measured it all. Now look...

413
00:48:20,597 --> 00:48:23,657
Three steps ahead is the TV.
You're behind by three steps.

414
00:48:24,301 --> 00:48:28,670
Five steps away is the fridge...
and you're five steps behind.

415
00:48:30,307 --> 00:48:32,673
Hungry? All right.

416
00:48:38,315 --> 00:48:40,681
You broke the walnut without
shattering the glass!

417
00:48:40,984 --> 00:48:43,680
This is indeed surprising.
But you can do it too.

418
00:48:44,821 --> 00:48:47,289
Give me your right hand...
Go on.

419
00:48:47,658 --> 00:48:50,286
Now hold the walnut between
two fingers and your thumb.

420
00:48:51,328 --> 00:48:53,694
Move it 45 degrees
to the right...

421
00:48:53,830 --> 00:48:56,298
now hurl it using your shoulder!

422
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:07,299
That's all right.
You seem to have caught a cold.

423
00:49:07,511 --> 00:49:08,876
One moment, please.

424
00:49:09,346 --> 00:49:14,716
One, two, three, four, five...

425
00:49:14,851 --> 00:49:18,309
l don't want a cold drink.
- l'm not giving you a cold drink.

426
00:49:18,755 --> 00:49:21,315
l was giving you something
to change into.

427
00:49:24,361 --> 00:49:27,728
We keep the soft drinks in
the cupboard. Here you are.

428
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:33,734
Go ahead and change. l'll go
and make some hot tea for you.

429
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:35,633
Strong, but low on sugar.

430
00:50:15,412 --> 00:50:19,371
One, two, three, four...

431
00:50:21,718 --> 00:50:25,210
For a moment, l thought
you were watching me.

432
00:50:25,589 --> 00:50:27,784
l was watching you.
- What?!

433
00:50:28,425 --> 00:50:31,792
Not with my eyes...
with my heart.

434
00:50:37,934 --> 00:50:40,402
Were you by birth...
- No.

435
00:50:41,438 --> 00:50:43,406
l wasn't poor by birth either.

436
00:50:46,443 --> 00:50:48,809
My father was rich and handsome.

437
00:50:49,446 --> 00:50:52,074
You'll find his picture
on this wall.

438
00:50:54,751 --> 00:50:57,413
We owned handloom factories
in Honolulu.

439
00:50:57,954 --> 00:51:00,422
We had half a dozen bungalows
and a fleet of cars.

440
00:51:01,458 --> 00:51:03,824
One fine day, there was this
blaze in our factory.

441
00:51:04,461 --> 00:51:06,827
And my father died
of shock.

442
00:51:10,467 --> 00:51:13,834
l lost my mother even
before l was born.

443
00:51:18,809 --> 00:51:24,839
Then into this lonely life
of mine... came Meena.

444
00:51:27,217 --> 00:51:29,708
Perhaps l was not destined to
enjoy those little joys either.

445
00:51:29,986 --> 00:51:31,851
Even as she walked
on the streets one day...

446
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:35,856
There came this truck...

447
00:51:36,493 --> 00:51:38,461
Meena didn't realise it...

448
00:51:38,995 --> 00:51:43,455
and l screamed, ''Meena!''
But she didn't hear me.

449
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,868
The truck was racing towards her,
and l screamed, ''Meena''

450
00:51:48,505 --> 00:51:53,465
''Save Meena!
Stop the truck, someone!''

451
00:51:53,677 --> 00:51:56,475
But no one heard me!
And the truck sped towards her!

452
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:58,878
l ran to her, even as the truck
was about to run her over!

453
00:51:59,015 --> 00:52:00,482
l leapt on her and...

454
00:52:08,525 --> 00:52:16,899
The headlights of that truck
took away the sight of my eyes!

455
00:52:19,002 --> 00:52:21,493
And Meena... how is she?

456
00:52:25,842 --> 00:52:33,510
Meena... is now with me.

457
00:52:35,785 --> 00:52:39,516
She's a mother to
two babies.

458
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:44,925
Where is she?

459
00:52:46,563 --> 00:52:47,928
She must be around.

460
00:52:54,070 --> 00:52:55,935
There's someone to meet you!

461
00:52:59,075 --> 00:53:02,704
This is my Meena.
- This... Meena!?

462
00:53:04,581 --> 00:53:06,947
Come to me, Meena.
- And l thought it was a woman!

463
00:53:07,083 --> 00:53:10,541
What l regret is that l can't
see my Meena anymore.

464
00:53:11,221 --> 00:53:14,554
Don't lose heart.
Your eyes can be cured.

465
00:53:14,991 --> 00:53:16,959
Only if Doctor Rustom
wishes to!

466
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:19,552
But he asks for a fees
of 20,000 Rupees!

467
00:53:19,896 --> 00:53:22,956
And l don't even have

468
00:53:27,604 --> 00:53:32,564
Really? ln that case, l'll have
myself operated tomorrow!

469
00:53:32,909 --> 00:53:36,572
We're friends. And l haven't
even asked your name!

470
00:53:36,947 --> 00:53:40,974
What... is your name?
- Seema.

471
00:53:42,118 --> 00:53:46,020
My name is Babulal.
But you can call me Raj.

472
00:53:47,123 --> 00:53:49,990
lt's settled then. l'll pick
you up from here tomorrow...

473
00:53:50,126 --> 00:53:53,584
to go to Dr. Rustom's clinic.
- That's not necessary!

474
00:53:53,697 --> 00:53:56,257
l'll meet you at the bus-stop
at exactly 8.02 a.m.!

475
00:53:56,933 --> 00:53:59,993
lt has stopped raining.
- The tank must've been emptied.

476
00:54:00,136 --> 00:54:04,004
What?!
- Tank... l mean, thank you!

477
00:54:06,643 --> 00:54:08,110
You may leave now.

478
00:54:08,645 --> 00:54:13,605
One moment...
That's the only kurta l have.

479
00:54:16,653 --> 00:54:20,020
That's okay...
- l'll go and change.

480
00:54:33,169 --> 00:54:36,036
Hurry up, guys! Quick!

481
00:54:55,992 --> 00:54:59,052
Here we are! This is the place!

482
00:55:02,699 --> 00:55:05,065
Strange! This is exactly
like your house!

483
00:55:05,702 --> 00:55:11,663
Really? How would l know?
l haven't seen my place.

484
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:17,077
That's okay.
Lokhandwala Builders, you see.

485
00:55:17,213 --> 00:55:19,078
They make identical structures.

486
00:55:20,016 --> 00:55:21,677
Shall we go in?
lt's 8.04 a.m.

487
00:55:27,724 --> 00:55:30,090
Do you have an appointment?
- Yes.

488
00:55:30,727 --> 00:55:35,460
We were supposed to be here at 8.05.
We're late by half a minute.

489
00:55:35,632 --> 00:55:37,190
Okay... Please be seated.

490
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:40,699
The doctor's in the operation
theatre. He'll join you soon.

491
00:55:45,742 --> 00:55:50,702
lt was such a complicated case!
l gave the kid a frog's eyes!

492
00:55:51,281 --> 00:55:53,044
A frog's eyes?!
- Yes.

493
00:55:53,149 --> 00:55:55,709
Small eyes for the kids, y'see.
They cause no problems!

494
00:55:56,753 --> 00:55:59,119
Will you give him
frog's eyes, too?

495
00:55:59,756 --> 00:56:02,725
Am l crazy to give him
frog's eyes, my boy?

496
00:56:02,926 --> 00:56:05,724
l'll transplant two
different eyes on him!

497
00:56:05,895 --> 00:56:08,125
One from a goat!
Another from an owl!

498
00:56:08,765 --> 00:56:11,734
Exactly! He can use the goat's eye
to see during the day.

499
00:56:11,835 --> 00:56:14,133
But the owl's eye will help him
see clearly in darkness!

500
00:56:14,270 --> 00:56:17,728
The double-purpose cure!
Praise doctor Rustom!

501
00:56:18,174 --> 00:56:21,143
Can't you transplant the
human eyes on me, doctor?

502
00:56:21,411 --> 00:56:25,575
l have no problem, you know.
But that'll cost 5000 rupees extra.

503
00:56:26,082 --> 00:56:29,142
l've brought 25000 with me.
- Never mind that, Seema.

504
00:56:29,285 --> 00:56:32,152
l'll manage with a goat's
and an owl's eye!

505
00:56:32,288 --> 00:56:34,153
No, Raj! For my sake!

506
00:56:34,791 --> 00:56:38,158
So let's get cracking! Because
even l can't see after dusk!

507
00:56:38,428 --> 00:56:41,158
Why not?
- l have goat's eyes, you see!

508
00:56:46,803 --> 00:56:51,172
lt's a major operation!
Lie down quietly! Hurry up!

509
00:56:51,808 --> 00:56:54,174
Do you know what a dangerous
case this is?!

510
00:56:56,813 --> 00:56:58,781
Do wait for me...

511
00:56:59,315 --> 00:57:00,907
Wait for me, Seema!

512
00:57:03,319 --> 00:57:05,787
How was it?
- My foot!

513
00:57:05,889 --> 00:57:09,188
What was that nonsense about
two different eyes, you idiot!

514
00:57:09,325 --> 00:57:11,623
l was only trying to impress her.

515
00:57:11,828 --> 00:57:14,797
You'd have been exposed, you idiot!
She'd have realised everything!

516
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:23,196
l told you l can't play a doctor.
- So What will you play?

517
00:57:23,339 --> 00:57:25,204
l've always played the compounder!
- Rubbish!

518
00:57:25,375 --> 00:57:27,206
l work so hard!
And all l get is abuses!

519
00:57:27,343 --> 00:57:29,208
Put that bandage on my eye!
- l work so very hard!

520
00:57:37,854 --> 00:57:39,219
Get up, my boy!

521
00:57:40,857 --> 00:57:42,825
Take off that bandage!
Go on!

522
00:57:42,926 --> 00:57:45,261
Doctor... will you remove the
bandage so soon?

523
00:57:45,261 --> 00:57:47,229
This is a laser-operation, lady.

524
00:57:47,363 --> 00:57:48,990
We must take off the
bandage immediately.

525
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:51,827
ln a computer operation,
we don't even use bandages!

526
00:57:53,369 --> 00:57:56,236
Whom would you first
like to see, my boy?

527
00:57:56,873 --> 00:57:59,239
l want to behold the Goddess...

528
00:57:59,375 --> 00:58:03,243
who has painted my black-and-white
life with Eastmancolor!

529
00:58:04,881 --> 00:58:07,247
Now hurry up and open your eyes!

530
00:58:08,284 --> 00:58:10,844
Which one? The left or the right?
- Open both!

531
00:58:11,221 --> 00:58:13,246
Or you'll see only
half the Goddess!

532
00:58:16,893 --> 00:58:20,260
l can see again!
l can see everything!

533
00:58:23,199 --> 00:58:25,030
You're Seema, aren't you?
- Yes.

534
00:58:25,301 --> 00:58:28,828
You are so beautiful, Seema!
And this is such a swanky hospital!

535
00:58:29,239 --> 00:58:32,265
Sister... l mean, auntie!
You're so good, too!

536
00:58:32,909 --> 00:58:36,868
As for you, doctor...
you shake so well!

537
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:38,708
l've practiced it, my boy.

538
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:46,889
Let's get cracking on
the third operation!

539
00:59:08,945 --> 00:59:10,310
Will you have a walnut?

540
00:59:16,953 --> 00:59:18,921
This world looks so beautiful.

541
00:59:19,355 --> 00:59:21,323
For you.
- This is amazing!

542
00:59:21,591 --> 00:59:23,923
You broke the walnut again.
But not the glass.

543
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:29,320
Nothing amazing.
You end up breaking the glass...

544
00:59:29,465 --> 00:59:32,332
when you're in love with someone.

545
00:59:32,969 --> 00:59:34,937
l don't agree.
- Don't you?

546
00:59:35,305 --> 00:59:39,332
One second... try now.

547
00:59:40,977 --> 00:59:41,944
Throw it.

548
00:59:51,554 --> 00:59:54,614
This means, you are in
love with someone.

549
00:59:58,995 --> 01:00:02,954
And l see my own face
in your eyes.

550
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,968
You're aren't... are you?

551
01:00:12,508 --> 01:00:13,372
Me too!

552
01:04:14,550 --> 01:04:15,414
Come here!

553
01:04:17,753 --> 01:04:22,213
l gave you the assignment to get
my daughter married to Nitin.

554
01:04:22,592 --> 01:04:25,618
And l see you...
- No! You're mistaken.

555
01:04:30,266 --> 01:04:32,234
Actually, the truth is that...

556
01:04:32,568 --> 01:04:35,628
l had to break her heart, to make
her and Nitin come together.

557
01:04:35,771 --> 01:04:39,229
And the one who break hearts
and brings people together...

558
01:04:39,775 --> 01:04:42,243
l don't know what they call him!
But don't you worry.

559
01:04:42,578 --> 01:04:45,911
Send Nitin over to me.
l'll explain things to him.

560
01:04:46,349 --> 01:04:49,250
You don't have to tell me anything.
l have faith in Raj.

561
01:04:49,452 --> 01:04:51,920
Believe me, Seema!
Raj is only cheating you!

562
01:04:52,288 --> 01:04:54,654
lt's Raj's birthday today.
And l'm going to him.

563
01:04:54,790 --> 01:04:57,657
Come with me. All your
misgivings will be cleared.

564
01:04:57,793 --> 01:04:59,658
Let's go.
- Let's go.

565
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:05,767
She has arrived!

566
01:05:12,608 --> 01:05:14,269
Wasn't it fantastic!

567
01:05:14,610 --> 01:05:18,671
We converted my house into a hospital
the second time she came here!

568
01:05:21,117 --> 01:05:24,678
The truth is that l haven't met
a more foolish girl than Seema!

569
01:05:24,820 --> 01:05:26,287
She's a bloody idiot!

570
01:05:28,024 --> 01:05:29,286
And she said...

571
01:05:29,659 --> 01:05:33,686
''How do you keep everything in place
when you can't even see?''

572
01:05:36,198 --> 01:05:37,688
And look at my genius!

573
01:05:37,833 --> 01:05:41,132
l said, ''l have a measure
of everything''

574
01:05:43,639 --> 01:05:48,702
l said, ''Three steps ahead
is the TV''

575
01:05:49,345 --> 01:05:51,711
''And three steps back
are you''

576
01:05:54,884 --> 01:05:56,146
We were talking about you...

577
01:05:57,420 --> 01:05:59,718
You cheat! You have enacted
this farce only for money!

578
01:06:00,356 --> 01:06:02,324
You have toyed
with my feelings!

579
01:06:02,491 --> 01:06:04,322
You pretended to be blind
and fooled me!

580
01:06:04,527 --> 01:06:06,722
l was blind; not you!

581
01:06:07,363 --> 01:06:12,733
How easily did l trust you!
l fell in love with you!

582
01:06:15,371 --> 01:06:17,737
l just couldn't see the truth!
- That's all right...

583
01:06:18,708 --> 01:06:21,336
Rains in summer! A tank
that was emptied!

584
01:06:21,544 --> 01:06:24,741
Doctor Rustom and his
laser-operations!

585
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:28,338
You said you'd manage with
a goat's and an owl's eyes!

586
01:06:37,393 --> 01:06:40,760
We have it made, daddy!
- Shut up!

587
01:06:41,397 --> 01:06:42,864
Don't call me daddy!

588
01:06:42,932 --> 01:06:45,765
lf someone hears you,
it could upset our plans!

589
01:06:46,402 --> 01:06:48,768
Once this girl is
married to you...

590
01:06:49,405 --> 01:06:56,368
l will see how my file
reaches the C.B.l.!

591
01:06:56,912 --> 01:06:58,209
Come on in.

592
01:07:06,422 --> 01:07:08,390
You have fulfilled
a father's dream.

593
01:07:09,058 --> 01:07:12,391
l'm indebted to you.
- 'That's all right.'

594
01:07:12,828 --> 01:07:15,388
Here's the rest of
your 40,000 Rupees.

595
01:07:17,433 --> 01:07:19,799
Put this money in our
Swiss accounts, Ramlal.

596
01:07:22,071 --> 01:07:26,804
By the way, people with short lives
must not make such tall promises.

597
01:07:27,276 --> 01:07:30,404
Pardon me?
- that brain-tumour you have.

598
01:07:31,547 --> 01:07:33,014
There's no cause
for worry anymore.

599
01:07:33,115 --> 01:07:35,413
Go and arrange for your
daughter's marriage.

600
01:07:37,953 --> 01:07:42,413
Seema is a very nice girl.
You're lucky to find such a girl.

601
01:07:43,459 --> 01:07:46,428
Go on now. And keep her happy.

602
01:07:49,465 --> 01:07:50,830
Shall we leave, uncle?
- Yes.

603
01:07:50,966 --> 01:07:52,433
Just a minute...

604
01:07:58,474 --> 01:08:03,434
This is the 25000 Rupees l took

605
01:08:07,483 --> 01:08:08,848
And this...

606
01:08:19,495 --> 01:08:21,463
l didn't enjoy this work
for the first ever time.

607
01:08:22,498 --> 01:08:26,867
We shouldn't have broken her heart.
That's what l think, you know.

608
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:28,862
No, Ramlal.

609
01:08:29,505 --> 01:08:32,872
One has to break a girl's heart
to drive her closer to someone.

610
01:08:33,509 --> 01:08:35,875
Had l not jilted her...

611
01:08:36,512 --> 01:08:39,481
she would never have married
the man of her father's choice.

612
01:08:40,516 --> 01:08:43,883
And we have been paid
for the job, haven't we?

613
01:08:44,153 --> 01:08:47,884
The first ever job we
haven't lost our money on!

614
01:09:13,983 --> 01:09:16,008
Before Seema gets to know the
truth about us...

615
01:09:16,552 --> 01:09:19,521
marry her in court. So we can
carry on with our plans.

616
01:09:22,858 --> 01:09:25,520
C.B.l. officer Deepak Malhotra.

617
01:09:26,562 --> 01:09:30,931
l arrest you both in
the Dhanlaxmi Bank scandal.

618
01:09:34,570 --> 01:09:36,936
Today is the 26th of September.

619
01:09:37,573 --> 01:09:41,532
And it will go down in Goa's history
as the day Gayatri Bachchan died.

620
01:09:42,077 --> 01:09:44,545
We will get to hear of her
death very soon...

621
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:47,178
and that will be the end
of all my problems!

622
01:09:49,084 --> 01:09:50,949
There you are! The good news.

623
01:09:53,989 --> 01:09:55,388
This is Rani speaking.

624
01:09:55,591 --> 01:10:00,551
Deliver the good news, Rani!

625
01:10:01,997 --> 01:10:04,966
Shiva's car has met
with an accident.

626
01:10:10,606 --> 01:10:12,233
The mission has failed.

627
01:10:16,912 --> 01:10:20,973
September 26; a public function
presided over by Gayatri Bachchan.

628
01:10:22,251 --> 01:10:25,584
And only 200 metres away from
the venue, there was a car accident.

629
01:10:27,623 --> 01:10:29,591
The man who died in
the mishap...

630
01:10:29,959 --> 01:10:33,986
was Mumbai's dreaded
contract-killer, Shiva.

631
01:10:34,630 --> 01:10:36,996
The police recovered from his body
this pistol, hand-grenades...

632
01:10:37,633 --> 01:10:39,999
a return ticket to Mumbai...

633
01:10:40,135 --> 01:10:44,595
and this half-burnt VVlP pass
to the C.M.'s function.

634
01:10:45,975 --> 01:10:50,002
The police searched his house and
came up with 10 million in cash...

635
01:10:50,145 --> 01:10:53,603
and a photograph of
Mrs. Gayatri Bachchan.

636
01:10:53,983 --> 01:10:57,612
Which means someone had hired Shiva
to assassinate Mrs. Bachchan.

637
01:10:57,753 --> 01:11:00,119
The recovery of the VVlP pass

638
01:11:00,656 --> 01:11:03,022
that the man who gave the
contract has great access.

639
01:11:03,659 --> 01:11:07,026
The one killed is the
contract killer.

640
01:11:07,663 --> 01:11:09,255
Not the one who gave
the contract.

641
01:11:09,665 --> 01:11:11,633
Before this man makes
another attempt...

642
01:11:11,834 --> 01:11:14,632
we will send a
secret agent to Goa.

643
01:11:14,970 --> 01:11:18,030
He will not only protect
Mrs. Gayatri Bachchan...

644
01:11:18,173 --> 01:11:20,641
but investigate this case, too.

645
01:11:21,076 --> 01:11:23,636
l have found a very capable
agent for this case.

646
01:11:23,812 --> 01:11:29,045
He has single-handedly solved the
Jhunjhunwala bank fraud case...

647
01:11:29,184 --> 01:11:32,051
and submitted the file to me
on the 24th of September.

648
01:11:32,688 --> 01:11:39,059
The identity of the man is a mystery.
Only l know him.

649
01:11:41,697 --> 01:11:46,657
You will go to Mumbai and give
this computer floppy to our agent.

650
01:11:47,202 --> 01:11:52,071
This floppy has details of
all the people we suspect.

651
01:11:52,574 --> 01:11:54,007
How will l contact him?

652
01:11:55,210 --> 01:11:57,075
That is explained in
this envelope.

653
01:11:57,713 --> 01:11:59,078
Mr Sharma...

654
01:12:00,049 --> 01:12:03,678
our secret agent will occupy
Seat# 1C on the aircraft.

655
01:12:04,119 --> 01:12:08,681
You will pin this flower on him
and look after his security.

656
01:12:09,725 --> 01:12:14,094
Mr Chopra... you will
receive him at the Goa airport.

657
01:12:14,229 --> 01:12:16,094
This flower will help you
recognise him.

658
01:12:17,599 --> 01:12:21,695
You will provide him all the things
he needs for this operation.

659
01:12:22,738 --> 01:12:27,698
This operation will be
called ''Operation Maa''

660
01:12:28,243 --> 01:12:31,701
And the code-name of our
secret agent will be '' Badshah''.

661
01:12:36,251 --> 01:12:39,379
A secret meeting of the CBl
was held today, Thapar...

662
01:12:46,428 --> 01:12:49,727
What's wrong, Chief?
- This matter has reached The CBl.

663
01:12:50,766 --> 01:12:53,735
They are despatching Badshah,
a secret agent...

664
01:12:53,936 --> 01:12:57,133
to make enquiries.

665
01:12:58,774 --> 01:13:05,737
Mrs. Nathan of the CBl is meeting
that agent in Mumbai tomorrow.

666
01:13:07,783 --> 01:13:11,742
l want you to shadow her
and find out who Badshah is.

667
01:13:12,788 --> 01:13:16,747
Well, Mr Mahindra? What makes
you remember Badshah again?

668
01:13:17,126 --> 01:13:21,756
l can't tell you over the telephone.
Meet me at Fantasy Land immediately!

669
01:13:59,835 --> 01:14:03,794
l'm waiting to see
whom you will meet.

670
01:14:04,473 --> 01:14:05,804
Yes, sir?

671
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:09,205
Don't look at me!
Turn around!

672
01:14:11,847 --> 01:14:15,214
Let's talk with our backs to each
other! No one must suspect us!

673
01:14:16,852 --> 01:14:19,480
Well... what have you
called me here for?

674
01:14:19,855 --> 01:14:24,815
My 7-year old daughter was kidnapped

675
01:14:27,863 --> 01:14:29,490
Have you informed the police?

676
01:14:29,998 --> 01:14:35,231
No! The kidnapper has threatened
to kill her, if l tell the police!

677
01:14:36,872 --> 01:14:40,239
When did you get to know?
- Last night.

678
01:14:40,375 --> 01:14:42,172
The kidnapper telephoned me.

679
01:14:45,881 --> 01:14:47,246
This is Deepak.

680
01:14:49,885 --> 01:14:54,845
l'm at Akbarally's, Mr Deepak.
Where are you at the moment?

681
01:14:55,891 --> 01:14:59,258
l'm very close. But let's
talk over the telephone.

682
01:15:00,896 --> 01:15:03,865
Someone could have shadowed you.
l could be recognised.

683
01:15:05,501 --> 01:15:07,366
What message do you have for me?

684
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:09,461
You've got to leave for Goa.

685
01:15:11,907 --> 01:15:15,274
Yes. The kidnapper has asked me
to put up at Hotel Blue Nile, Goa.

686
01:15:15,911 --> 01:15:17,378
That is where l will
receive further word.

687
01:15:18,914 --> 01:15:21,280
What has he asked for?
- Diamonds worth 50 million.

688
01:15:21,550 --> 01:15:23,279
l'm willing to give him
the diamonds.

689
01:15:23,552 --> 01:15:27,283
But he might take the diamonds and
still not return my daughter to me!

690
01:15:27,923 --> 01:15:31,290
You must help me!
l beg at your feet!

691
01:15:31,426 --> 01:15:34,293
Do not beg at the horse's feet.
What do you want me to do?

692
01:15:34,930 --> 01:15:37,899
Go to Goa, on my behalf.
And deal with that man.

693
01:15:39,935 --> 01:15:42,904
When do l leave for Goa?
- By the 9 a.m. flight tomorrow.

694
01:15:43,272 --> 01:15:47,231
The code-name for the
operation is ''Maa''.

695
01:15:47,943 --> 01:15:51,902
You will receive the ticket from
the executive-class counter...

696
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:58,317
of lndian Airlines on stating
your code-name.

697
01:15:58,954 --> 01:16:00,922
What is the code-name?
- Badshah.

698
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:03,324
There's no time.
Quickly book us on a train.

699
01:16:03,458 --> 01:16:05,926
Don't talk nonsense!
l'll send you there by plane!

700
01:16:06,094 --> 01:16:08,426
No... l have four assistants, too.
- Never mind.

701
01:16:08,497 --> 01:16:11,330
l'll leave the tickets with the
counter at the airport.

702
01:16:11,466 --> 01:16:14,333
Collect the tickets after
telling them your name.

703
01:16:15,470 --> 01:16:19,338
As for your stay in Goa, l'll
inform my Chief Executive there.

704
01:16:19,975 --> 01:16:21,340
He will arrange everything.

705
01:16:23,979 --> 01:16:24,946
Turn around!

706
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:30,946
Here are the diamonds. Worth 50
million. And my daughter's snap.

707
01:16:32,988 --> 01:16:34,956
Where is the dossier
of this case?

708
01:16:35,390 --> 01:16:38,951
lt's in a computer floppy.
How do l reach it to you?

709
01:16:39,528 --> 01:16:43,123
Keep it in a purse. And leave
the purse where you're standing.

710
01:16:43,398 --> 01:16:44,956
l'll pick it up.

711
01:17:13,528 --> 01:17:15,393
Leave for Goa by
this evening's flight.

712
01:17:16,031 --> 01:17:18,397
l'll ring up Uncle Tom.
He'll meet you there.

713
01:17:19,034 --> 01:17:23,994
He knows Goa well.
Meet me at Goa airport tomorrow.

714
01:17:24,539 --> 01:17:29,408
And remember; my code-name
is Badshah. And yours is Rosy.

715
01:17:33,348 --> 01:17:37,011
This is Rani here.
- Yes? Any information on Badshah?

716
01:17:37,586 --> 01:17:39,417
He's a smart man, chief.

717
01:17:40,055 --> 01:17:42,421
He walked away with the floppy
without even meeting Mrs. Nathan.

718
01:17:43,058 --> 01:17:48,690
The only chance to identify him...
and you've blown it!

719
01:17:49,131 --> 01:17:51,429
l have another chance, Chief.

720
01:17:51,566 --> 01:17:54,433
He will collect his tickets from
counter at the airport...

721
01:17:54,569 --> 01:17:58,437
after identifying himself as Badshah.
And l will identify him.

722
01:17:59,708 --> 01:18:03,439
Here's what you will do;
find a clever man this time...

723
01:18:03,578 --> 01:18:06,046
who will finish Badshah
at the airport itself...

724
01:18:06,248 --> 01:18:08,716
and come to Goa as Badshah.

725
01:18:11,086 --> 01:18:14,453
l'll get Moti to carry out
this job for us.

726
01:18:15,090 --> 01:18:17,456
This job isn't for dogs, Rani!

727
01:18:19,394 --> 01:18:22,454
Moti isn't a dog, chief.
He's my boyfriend.

728
01:18:22,597 --> 01:18:27,466
He's just been released from
prison and is here with me.

729
01:18:28,603 --> 01:18:33,063
All right. lf Moti can
pull this off for us...

730
01:18:33,608 --> 01:18:39,740
l'll cover you in pearls.
Or you get acid on your face!

731
01:18:40,615 --> 01:18:43,607
How will it help to bring
Moti here as Badshah?

732
01:18:44,453 --> 01:18:47,479
The CBl will take Moti
for their agent, Badshah...

733
01:18:48,123 --> 01:18:50,489
and appoint him to protect
Gayatri Bachchan.

734
01:18:52,127 --> 01:18:55,494
He will kill Gayatri Bachchan as
soon as he gets the opportunity...

735
01:18:56,131 --> 01:18:59,100
to turn an assassin.

736
01:19:09,144 --> 01:19:11,112
Here we are.
Now behave yourselves!

737
01:19:20,155 --> 01:19:24,524
Get the stuff, Ramlal.
l'll go and fetch the tickets.

738
01:19:27,162 --> 01:19:29,528
Want a trolley, sir?
- ls it for free?

739
01:19:29,664 --> 01:19:31,131
Of course.
- l'll take it then.

740
01:19:53,188 --> 01:19:54,553
The name is...

741
01:20:01,196 --> 01:20:04,563
Walkman...
l've forgotten my walkman!

742
01:20:04,699 --> 01:20:06,564
l'll be back in a moment!
Please don't go away!

743
01:20:12,207 --> 01:20:13,572
Here you are.

744
01:20:14,743 --> 01:20:17,576
Hurry up! lf the plane fills up,
we'll have to travel standing!

745
01:20:17,712 --> 01:20:21,580
No worry, Ramlal. There's still

746
01:20:44,239 --> 01:20:47,606
''Mr Badshah, who is travelling
by the Executive Class to Goa''

747
01:20:47,742 --> 01:20:50,210
''There is a call for you
in the executive lounge''

748
01:20:51,813 --> 01:20:52,780
Your ticket!

749
01:21:02,557 --> 01:21:04,718
Badshah, my son!
This is ma here!

750
01:21:06,995 --> 01:21:09,225
You've forgotten your
things at home!

751
01:21:10,265 --> 01:21:13,632
My things?
- How'll you shave without the kit?

752
01:21:15,670 --> 01:21:17,638
You've kept the sweets
safely, haven't you?

753
01:21:19,207 --> 01:21:20,902
Give some to the rascals too!

754
01:21:35,290 --> 01:21:37,656
Where's the lady?
....Well, never mind.

755
01:21:38,693 --> 01:21:40,661
Could you give me
my ticket, please?

756
01:21:40,795 --> 01:21:43,263
The name is... Badshah.

757
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:46,767
Here's your ticket, Mr Badshah.

758
01:21:51,806 --> 01:21:54,104
Excuse me... your tickets are here.

759
01:21:58,313 --> 01:22:02,272
''There's a call for Mr Badshah,
travelling to Goa''

760
01:22:02,651 --> 01:22:06,280
''Please proceed to
the executive lounge''

761
01:22:07,322 --> 01:22:09,290
Who could it be?

762
01:22:24,739 --> 01:22:26,297
Hey... what's wrong?

763
01:22:26,441 --> 01:22:30,309
Excessive pills. They've reacted.
l'm taking him to the hospital.

764
01:22:39,354 --> 01:22:43,313
Excuse me...!

765
01:22:43,858 --> 01:22:46,725
Listen... you've dropped something
to do with a computer...!

766
01:22:47,362 --> 01:22:49,330
A call for Mr Badshah

767
01:22:54,869 --> 01:22:57,337
Hello... this is Badshah here.

768
01:22:59,107 --> 01:23:00,074
Ma.

769
01:23:00,709 --> 01:23:03,735
Ma?! What's wrong with your voice?

770
01:23:09,951 --> 01:23:13,352
l see... Ma's operation!
lt's the doctor, isn't it?

771
01:23:17,392 --> 01:23:22,193
l think there's someone around him.
He's using code-words.

772
01:23:27,402 --> 01:23:29,370
Yes. This is the doctor here.

773
01:23:29,838 --> 01:23:31,772
Where are you calling from?
Your home or the dispensary?

774
01:23:31,940 --> 01:23:34,374
- Good. So What ls it?

775
01:23:34,642 --> 01:23:36,769
l have something very
important to tell you.

776
01:23:37,412 --> 01:23:41,371
You will meet my man on the flight.
He will give you a rose.

777
01:23:41,549 --> 01:23:46,384
Why did you have to take
the trouble, doctor?

778
01:23:46,588 --> 01:23:49,785
The success of this operation
now depends on you.

779
01:23:50,425 --> 01:23:54,384
This is a very big
operation for all of us!

780
01:23:55,430 --> 01:23:58,399
But it's a minor ailment,
isn't it?

781
01:23:59,934 --> 01:24:04,803
What we consider so important
is a minor ailment for him! Wow!

782
01:24:05,940 --> 01:24:09,239
Yes. lt's a minor ailment.
- Exactly!

783
01:24:09,577 --> 01:24:14,412
Remember; this operation has to be
completed in 15 days.

784
01:24:14,749 --> 01:24:19,413
15 days? l'll wrap up this case
in just a week and return!

785
01:24:19,754 --> 01:24:23,417
Don't worry, doctor!
Just look after Ma.

786
01:24:23,958 --> 01:24:25,823
l love Ma very much.

787
01:24:26,661 --> 01:24:30,825
Not only you. l love Ma too.

788
01:24:31,166 --> 01:24:32,428
Really?

789
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:34,431
The whole nation loves Ma!

790
01:24:34,969 --> 01:24:38,427
She isn't Ma just for you...
she's Ma for all of us!

791
01:24:38,540 --> 01:24:40,007
She's Ma for the
whole nation!

792
01:24:51,486 --> 01:24:52,953
We have finished
our conversation...

793
01:24:53,154 --> 01:24:55,452
and the idiot standing next
to him will think...

794
01:24:55,557 --> 01:24:59,459
that a doctor and his patient
were having a chat!

795
01:25:00,895 --> 01:25:02,863
l am sure now...

796
01:25:03,498 --> 01:25:07,457
that our ''Operation Maa''
will certainly be a success!

797
01:25:19,514 --> 01:25:22,483
Our man is now coming there as Badshah.

798
01:25:47,206 --> 01:25:50,573
Our man is now coming there
as Badshah.

799
01:25:51,210 --> 01:25:52,677
My name is Badshah.

800
01:25:53,045 --> 01:25:55,673
You have an economy class
ticket, Mr. Badshah.

801
01:25:56,215 --> 01:25:59,184
What are you talking about? An
economy class ticket for Badshah?

802
01:26:17,236 --> 01:26:19,204
You will return it, won't you?

803
01:26:27,246 --> 01:26:29,214
Your seats are back there.

804
01:26:29,315 --> 01:26:31,613
But we're together!
- Yes! We're travelling together!

805
01:26:31,750 --> 01:26:35,618
You have tickets for the economy
class, which is back there.

806
01:26:35,888 --> 01:26:38,618
We arrived in the same cab!
- That's right.

807
01:26:38,757 --> 01:26:40,622
So why this discrimination now?

808
01:26:41,260 --> 01:26:44,627
This is the First Class.
The Economy Class is back there.

809
01:26:46,265 --> 01:26:48,631
Third-class is
Economy Class in aircrafts!

810
01:26:50,769 --> 01:26:52,634
Back there, isn't it?
- That's right.

811
01:26:57,576 --> 01:26:59,635
Badshah travels first class;
and we suffer the third class!

812
01:26:59,778 --> 01:27:01,643
We should've taken
a train instead.

813
01:27:04,283 --> 01:27:06,251
Are they for free?
- Yes.

814
01:27:10,289 --> 01:27:11,654
Come back with some more later.

815
01:27:14,293 --> 01:27:15,658
Please sit down.

816
01:27:34,313 --> 01:27:37,680
l know why people fly!
- Why?

817
01:27:38,317 --> 01:27:39,944
The ticket-collectors
are all girls!

818
01:27:40,319 --> 01:27:43,686
Oh no. That was an air-hostess!
That chap is the ticket-collector!

819
01:27:47,326 --> 01:27:49,954
Strange! The ticket-collector
is selling chocolates!

820
01:27:50,329 --> 01:27:51,956
He must have wafers too,
what say?

821
01:27:55,334 --> 01:27:57,700
Please put your luggage
in the locker above.

822
01:27:58,337 --> 01:28:00,305
lf the luggage goes in,
where will we sleep?

823
01:28:00,406 --> 01:28:02,306
This isn't a train berth.
This is a locker.

824
01:28:20,359 --> 01:28:23,726
Could you send a tea-vendor
when the plane halts somewhere?

Have patience, sir. You will get
tea and snacks, too.

826
01:28:27,900 --> 01:28:32,337
Snacks? No thank you.
Our boss is in the first class.

01:28:32,538 --> 01:28:35,336
He's carrying all the money.
- We aren't asking for money, sir.

828
01:28:35,441 --> 01:28:36,999
Everything will be
served free.
