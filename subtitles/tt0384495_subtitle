1
00:01:42,168 --> 00:01:45,296
Look at that dancing doll.

2
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:50,635
Look at the way it's
composing tunes.

3
00:01:50,844 --> 00:01:52,072
l solved this sum by the method
you taught me.

4
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:53,302
lt was very easy.

5
00:01:54,013 --> 00:01:57,813
There is no
doll like my doll.

6
00:01:58,017 --> 00:01:58,984
Sir, paper

7
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:02,481
Come...come...parrot.

8
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:05,988
Come and have milk
and eat.

9
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:09,817
Shall l apply turmeric?

10
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,157
Congratulations to my friend
B.P. Madhavan.

11
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:16,001
For the next business endeavour,
friend who is embarking on a new journey,

12
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:17,328
Friend, we are awaiting
your success

13
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:32,345
NEXT...ENDEAVOUR...JOURNEY..
WE'RE AWAlTlNG.

14
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:58,432
All along you taught our children
without taking fees.

15
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:00,272
They were also
studying very well.

16
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,777
Now you are leaving
on another endeavour.

17
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:06,375
We wish you success
in your endeavour.

18
00:03:11,257 --> 00:03:13,225
Long live my son!

19
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:14,390
Come back soon.

20
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:18,898
l'm not able to
hold my breath.

21
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:23,565
That's why l suggested to you to take
1/4 bottle of liquor.

22
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:42,411
You donkey!

23
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:44,252
Useless!

24
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:47,759
Damn it...

25
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:50,653
Oldie...oldie...

26
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:53,024
Can't you hear me
screaming, oldie?

27
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:57,432
Haven't l repeatedly asked you, not to
hang the chickens like this?

28
00:03:57,637 --> 00:04:00,606
Why are you irritating me every day
in the morning? - Sir.

29
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:05,775
Will this small chicken hide such a
big sun? Oh my God.

30
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:07,276
Can l ever win you
in arguments?

31
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:08,781
That's what, even l'm
trying to imply.

32
00:04:09,148 --> 00:04:10,445
Just the way you've kept a
parrot at home,

33
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:11,776
l'm keeping a chicken in
my A/c outlet.

34
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:13,618
Just the way you've parked
a car in the car-park,

35
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,219
l've tied my cows
in my car park.

36
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:17,045
Do we've different
rights for us?

37
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,151
He's irritating us early
in the morning...

38
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:25,229
Even if you behave properly,
criticisms can't be avoided.

39
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:27,296
Education is not important,
my dear.

40
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:29,461
Our family pride should be
the watch word.

41
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:30,692
Do you understand?

42
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:37,542
After so much tongue-lashing,
you want cow's urine, is it?

43
00:04:38,511 --> 00:04:41,309
We have a naming ceremony for a child
at my house, that's why.

44
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:43,875
Be careful, the cow might
kick you.

45
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:45,443
Hey look, ''Music'' is coming.

46
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:47,319
That bloody Jackie Chang women is
also a accompanying her.

47
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,987
Today we'll...

48
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:57,159
Oh God! l'll slipper you,
useless guys.

49
00:04:57,363 --> 00:04:58,660
Try throwing this between your
dad & mother.

50
00:04:58,898 --> 00:05:00,729
Bravo! Hats off to
that lady.

51
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:02,524
That was powerful like
Saddam Hussain's bomb.

52
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:05,837
ls your dignity at stake
when l accompany you?

53
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:07,404
Why are you drawing
a long face?

54
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:10,399
Did you see the guts
of those bloody fellows?

55
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:13,134
A donkey doesn't know
the value of Saffron.

56
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:18,950
Dear Deivanai, don't talk to anybody,
go quietly & come back safely.

57
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:20,685
l'm talking to you only.

58
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:22,411
ls it difficult to say ''Yes''?

59
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:24,621
Why don't you say ''yes''
to her?

60
00:05:58,257 --> 00:05:59,724
Hey, who's that spitting
on my back?

61
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:00,956
Nothing....Sorry...

62
00:06:05,598 --> 00:06:06,724
Are you trying to
rub against me?

63
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:10,293
l carry a compass
for guys like you.

64
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:18,342
l'll skin you guys.

65
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:22,945
Hey conductor! You guys are
increasing the bus fare.

66
00:06:23,282 --> 00:06:25,147
Yet we are getting suffocated.

67
00:06:25,518 --> 00:06:27,042
Why don't you run extra buses?

68
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,418
Even l'm getting suffocated amidst
the crowd.

69
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:32,750
Why are you talking all the way?
Why are you complaining to me?

70
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,927
You're collecting the money,
who else should be told?

71
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:36,755
Question the guy who sits
in an A/c room.

72
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:39,363
Otherwise raise slogans, wave flags
or organize rallies.

73
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:41,429
lnstead of that why are you
talking of law here?

74
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:42,259
Buy the ticket...

75
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:46,100
What is he saying?

76
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:50,765
He says he has written about this problem
to the editor of ''Hindu'', newspaper.

77
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:53,605
Till now nearly 1000 people have
written in about 100 magazines.

78
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:55,371
What is the use?
Nothing has happened.

79
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:58,276
Politicians don't have the heart
to serve the people.

80
00:06:58,651 --> 00:07:02,519
They've time only to amass wealth through
scams & corruptions & safeguard it.

81
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:04,289
They have time only for that.

82
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:05,783
Give me a ticket
to central.

83
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:07,050
Stop it, man.

84
00:07:07,326 --> 00:07:11,353
Only when you face trouble in buses
you talk about social problems.

85
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:14,994
When you get off the
bus you forget it.

86
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:16,294
Don't be hypocrites.

87
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:17,127
Stop it.

88
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:19,804
You all know only to find
fault with everything.

89
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:22,474
No one comes forward to challenge
such issues.

90
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:25,803
The whole country is stinking with
sewage water like scandals.

91
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:27,980
ls there anyone to desilt
the sewage?

92
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:30,308
Will you come?..
Are you ready for it?

93
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:33,417
Barking dogs seldom bite.

94
00:07:33,686 --> 00:07:35,415
Biting dogs seldom bark.

95
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:36,985
Don't crib, shut
your mouths.

96
00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:45,163
Don't raise...Don't raise..
Don't raise bus fares...

97
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:48,162
Don't raise...Don't raise...
Don't raise bus fares.

98
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:53,733
Don't raise...Don't raise...
Don't raise bus fares.

99
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,837
How come transport companies lose
if government runs them,

100
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:57,339
And make profit when
a private firm
runs them?

101
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:00,675
People who've to alight at central,
please get down.

102
00:08:04,717 --> 00:08:06,378
Why are you pushing me to come in
the front? Stay there itself.

103
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:08,520
Why are you pushing in
this suffocation?

104
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:10,518
Somebody please take this money
& put it in the piggy bank.

105
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:14,253
Please, put it in the piggy bank.

106
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:33,602
Careful...

107
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:53,562
Princi, the witch.

108
00:09:56,996 --> 00:09:58,122
Get lost, you old lady.

109
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:14,145
Violent granny! violent granny!
When do we get freedom from you?

110
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:16,571
Give us in writing.

111
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:40,001
Oh Oldie! Please give up?
Don't splutter like mustard.

112
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:43,334
When it explodes, you'll
see it as bomb.

113
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:47,637
You belong to the black & white era.
While we are very colourful people.

114
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,944
Change your eyes along with
your glasses.

115
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:55,815
A dry fish can't swim.

116
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:06,328
Neither can you weave a cloth
from a spider's web.

117
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:10,060
Our grandpa's horse will be of
no use now.

118
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:08,618
Your days a over,
oldie, get lost.

119
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:12,797
Don't withhold our money.

120
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:24,776
You'll break our
dreams of desire.

121
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:30,772
We are cyclones wearing
short skirt.

122
00:12:30,983 --> 00:12:32,951
Oh! Dreams! Make way for us
and get lost.

123
00:12:56,342 --> 00:13:01,370
Oh Goddess! oh Goddess!

124
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:05,480
Oh Goddess! Oh Goddess.
-Come again?

125
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:07,111
Are you trying to
back answer?

126
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,554
Are you trying to
back answer?

127
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:16,928
Oh my dear, oh my dear.

128
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:25,762
Oh my dear...Oh my dear...

129
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:37,745
Our era is an
era of Laboratory.

130
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:41,547
Whereas yours was a
troublesome era.

131
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:53,296
Your era was a palanquin era,
whereas ours is a jet era.

132
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:55,862
l'm no more a kid.

133
00:13:57,903 --> 00:14:01,498
l'm no more a kid nor a
person to be trapped easily.

134
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:33,868
Open the door..
Open the door.

135
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:35,202
Look dear...

136
00:14:35,741 --> 00:14:37,868
By trying to cheat me, you're going
to cheat yourself.

137
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:38,873
Open the door...

138
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,614
1000 die in the Northern states
due to starvation.

139
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,578
Will the former Minister arrested,
for a food scam be released?

140
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:54,748
NORTHERN STATES.

141
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:58,760
When an individual misappropriates money
for personal gains,

142
00:14:58,964 --> 00:15:05,767
lt affects the society to a very
large extent. This report is about that.

143
00:15:09,775 --> 00:15:15,111
These cows which provide milk to the
poor farmers & their children,

144
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:19,910
Are being sold to slaughter houses.
Who's responsible for all this?

145
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:28,120
Cows died out of thirst & hunger and became
food for dogs & vultures.

146
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:29,123
Who's responsible for this?

147
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:35,327
Does this tragedy only
affect cows?

148
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:37,132
Haven't the humans
been affected by this?

149
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:44,671
Without knowing who is cheating them,
men are perishing of starvation.

150
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:45,872
Who's responsible for this?

151
00:15:48,847 --> 00:15:53,546
Here, nobody seems to be bothered
of anybody or anything.

152
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:58,954
ln an era when there is no value
for human life,

153
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:03,227
As if the death of cows
will stir the hearts of people?.

154
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:09,700
We are also living in this same land where
people are perishing of starvation.

155
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:13,968
Today it is them,
tomorrow it may be anybody?

156
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:16,702
lt could be any of us.

157
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:19,644
Friends, lets ponder over it.

158
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:21,904
Nobody came to save us.

159
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:08,388
l just need one card to
finish the game.

160
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:15,494
Haven't l told you not to come here
when the officer comes?

161
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:16,393
Go that side.

162
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:18,834
What all problems are there?
Okay.

163
00:17:27,746 --> 00:17:30,738
Only now the game begins,
it should be played well.

164
00:17:31,283 --> 00:17:32,750
Drink the milk.

165
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:38,753
Sir, 3 C.B.l officer's have come.

166
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:43,189
l'll meet them, tell them to wait.

167
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:45,589
After finishing my game
l'll meet them.

168
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:05,138
Sir, they want you to come soon.

169
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:10,611
Why are you telling me again & again?
l've already told you.

170
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:11,949
As soon as the game is over
l'll come.

171
00:18:12,157 --> 00:18:14,955
What sir?- You pig... swine.

172
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:25,361
Greetings sir!

173
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:34,168
950 crores!

174
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:36,909
We've to enquire about that.

175
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:49,821
When we asked you about 7 files
earlier, you said you haven't signed.

176
00:18:50,028 --> 00:18:54,727
When you were the Chief Minister,
your Home Secretary Mr. Brijesh said,

177
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,326
That you've signed.

178
00:18:56,568 --> 00:18:57,899
What do you have
to say about it?

179
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:03,235
Sir, you're sick, don't talk.
l've adviced you to take rest.

180
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:09,169
This is a political game against me.
lt had originated when l was the C.M.

181
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:10,678
And it is still continuing.

182
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:13,578
l know who is engineering
it against me.

183
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:15,611
What do you think?

184
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,847
An innocent man like me has no use
for such a big amount.

185
00:20:15,147 --> 00:20:19,106
l've no clue about the questions
you've put to me.

186
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:33,996
You would've closed your nose with
handkerchief unable to bear cow dung stink.

187
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,266
But we are tolerating this
thing perennially.

188
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:42,167
And it has become a
part of our life.

189
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:44,271
And it has entered every
pore of our body.

190
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:47,445
l'm ready to give my
skin to the people.

191
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:48,442
Sir, please don't talk.

192
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:52,640
l'm ready to get my skin peeled
off and made into slippers & shoes.

193
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:54,614
Sir, don't speak.

194
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,513
And you're blaming me?

195
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:00,781
Trying to get smart with me!
-Please sir, don't talk.

196
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:03,791
l've never bothered about my wife &
children for the welfare of my subjects.

197
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:08,961
Sir, don't speak. You need rest.

198
00:21:10,802 --> 00:21:13,032
Sir you're not feeling well.
You don't speak.

199
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:17,334
Officer, his ECG report is not normal
nor good.

200
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:20,144
Please question him after
he gets well.

201
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:22,639
Yes, sir.

202
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:41,159
You've come from a long distance for
enquiry. Atleast have milk & go.

203
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:17,361
Oh Sreedevi, after shiting dung in the
morning, you are getting excited?

204
00:22:17,569 --> 00:22:18,866
Shall l get you married?

205
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:20,797
Don't know where you've
the tail?

206
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:30,014
Take care of the dogs.
They may bite me.

207
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:35,710
What're you doing here?
Move away.

208
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:39,048
Have you spoiled it?
Do you think you're a M.P.?

209
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:45,695
What Madhuri Dixit, you're
giving such a pose,

210
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:49,230
As if you're going to
break into a dance.

211
00:22:50,268 --> 00:22:52,236
What's the matter?

212
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:07,802
Why should l be angry on you,
if you come early & pick this. Go....

213
00:24:52,557 --> 00:24:55,287
This is the Minister's T-shirt,
but where is he?

214
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:25,881
The former C.M. was kidnapped from his
farm house this morning.

215
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:33,157
Former Minister of Northern lndia has
been kidnapped in a strange way.

216
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:42,236
Police have found a tractor abandoned
on the highway near the Minister's house.

217
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:47,838
They suspect the Minister could've been
kidnapped in this cow dung tractor.

218
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:52,847
As you're transferred often, only once
a way you come here.

219
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:55,019
Here this girl doesn't
pay attention to me.

220
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:57,912
The girls in the flat have
all come back home.

221
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:00,247
l don't know what is
she doing there still?

222
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:03,122
lf l dare to enquire,
then l'll be branded as terror.

223
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:06,864
As a result of this kidnapping,
Minister's supporters are agitating.

224
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:10,527
Pandi, please switch off the T.V.

225
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:12,726
The whole state is very sensitive.

226
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:16,040
lt's been quite long since you're here.
Still your daughter is yet to come.

227
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:17,265
This is a daily affair.

228
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,544
Everyday she gives some
excuse or the other.

229
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:21,871
Either she will say some guys in
the auto ragged her,

230
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,047
Or that she had special class,

231
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:24,215
Or that she had to wait
for the bus.

232
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:27,943
She will relentlessly give excuses
like this.l'm not able to manage her.

233
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:31,214
There she is...

234
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:35,686
Don't pamper her as she comes in.
Take her to task.

235
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:39,621
Do you understand? Even you ask her
without being silent.

236
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:45,069
Don't fondle!

237
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:47,495
Hey, why are you late?

238
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:51,902
Daddy, granny never gave me the money
you sent for my French classes.

239
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,907
Look at the way she is
changing the subject.

240
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:54,908
You don't change the subject.

241
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:56,080
What did you do to
that money?

242
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:58,575
Come on tell daddy...
tell him, you oldie.

243
00:26:58,783 --> 00:26:59,579
l'll slap you...

244
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:00,409
ls this the way to
behave with elder people?

245
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,985
Mummy, daddy is always
finding fault with us.

246
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:07,255
She never gives me money
even to buy an ice cream.

247
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,927
She spends the money on buying
betel leaves. Miser lady!

248
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:11,595
Hey you are talking too much.

249
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:13,597
Come dear.

250
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:15,459
Look, how she is speaking
inspite of you being here.

251
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,131
l'll scald you later.

252
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:24,271
Police suspect that they must've
kidnapped only in the cow dung tractor.

253
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:25,534
Can you lower the volume, please?

254
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:30,281
Kindly rewind please.

255
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:45,959
This is what l had observed.

256
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:50,699
The kidnappers might have used this
tube for the victim to breathe.

257
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:56,800
Maximize this and send a copy to the
A.S.P who's handling the case.

258
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:01,368
Where are you posted now Pandiyan?

259
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:12,589
Otherwise can he give a clue for this
case, handled by a different dept.?

260
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:17,051
Only because such people exist,
public still has faith on us.

261
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:18,996
Can you connect me to
Bhuvaneswar S.P.?

262
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:28,334
''Thanks for your greetings''

263
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:31,407
Journey....Over...
Captive....Safe...

264
00:28:41,953 --> 00:28:43,079
Kind attention passengers....

265
00:28:43,621 --> 00:28:49,924
Train no 6041 which goes
via Salem, Trichy, Coimbatore...

266
00:28:50,128 --> 00:28:52,790
l'll bring her when the
vacation starts.

267
00:28:53,631 --> 00:28:57,931
Pandi, have a safe journey,
take food timely.

268
00:28:59,137 --> 00:29:03,767
Mother, give her this money from your
hands, she wants to join French classes.

269
00:29:03,975 --> 00:29:04,669
For what?

270
00:29:05,143 --> 00:29:08,340
lnspite of attending classes during
day time she comes late.

271
00:29:08,646 --> 00:29:10,011
Evening class is not
necessary for her.

272
00:29:10,815 --> 00:29:12,612
No mother, l promise,
Deiva will get back earlier.

273
00:29:12,817 --> 00:29:14,148
lt is always good to
learn an additional language.

274
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:15,885
You should be back by 7.00 p.m,
is it okay?

275
00:29:17,322 --> 00:29:20,553
Here mother - l'm agreeing because
you've promised.

276
00:29:20,825 --> 00:29:25,228
lf she reaches home later than 7 p.m,
l'll show my true colours.

277
00:29:27,499 --> 00:29:28,625
See you aunty,
see you dear.

278
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:30,494
Don't trouble granny,
get back home on time.

279
00:29:31,836 --> 00:29:32,359
See you mother.

280
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,137
Son, call me as soon as
you reach.

281
00:29:46,184 --> 00:29:47,048
Stupid fellow!

282
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:49,718
Don't you know that smoking is
banned in public places?

283
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:52,713
You've not only smoked cigaratte but
you've also blown the smoke on this girl.

284
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:55,584
Hey police, instead of just watching,
Put him behind bars.

285
00:29:56,194 --> 00:29:56,717
Come dear.

286
00:30:19,884 --> 00:30:20,509
Hey who are you?

287
00:30:20,718 --> 00:30:22,015
You're not allowed in the
1st class compartment, get lost.

288
00:30:30,395 --> 00:30:33,296
Who are you? Why did you get
into a running train?

289
00:30:33,898 --> 00:30:34,523
You are a thief, isn't it?

290
00:30:34,899 --> 00:30:37,697
Sir, this is unnecessary.
- Hit him .......

291
00:30:37,902 --> 00:30:39,369
Sir, am l not enquiring him?

292
00:30:39,571 --> 00:30:42,699
When he is enquiring,
why is everybody questioning?

293
00:30:42,907 --> 00:30:45,876
Sir, allow the boy to speak.
- Why are you so worried,

294
00:30:46,578 --> 00:30:48,102
As if you're carrying
luggages or money.

295
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:51,208
As a freedom fighter, you're permitted
to travel free of cost in trains.

296
00:30:51,416 --> 00:30:52,041
Shut your mouth &
leave this place.

297
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:54,718
Sir, check his bag,
there might be a bomb.

298
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:56,784
Sir check...He might be a terrorist
also? - Keep quiet.

299
00:30:57,589 --> 00:30:58,715
Give me the bag...
take out your bag.

300
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:01,452
Look...Check what's
in his bag.

301
00:31:02,927 --> 00:31:04,394
l'm not the kind of person
you're thinking me to be.

302
00:31:05,763 --> 00:31:09,563
ln a hurry, l got into this
compartment, l'm sorry.

303
00:31:11,102 --> 00:31:13,400
As soon as the train stops,
l'll go to the general compartment.

304
00:31:18,109 --> 00:31:18,939
Trust me.

305
00:31:31,956 --> 00:31:33,924
He has got a ticket, but check out
whether it is for this train.

306
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:35,422
Yes, it is for this train.

307
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:36,753
Ticket! - Now that he has a ticket,
everybody clear out.

308
00:31:36,961 --> 00:31:40,089
Go inside...Go...

309
00:31:40,298 --> 00:31:41,424
Always ready to abuse others.

310
00:31:56,481 --> 00:31:57,607
Where's the dry fish gravy
which my mother gave?

311
00:31:58,316 --> 00:31:59,783
Oh god, l've forgotten it.

312
00:31:59,984 --> 00:32:01,849
You'll forget everything
whatever my mother gives.

313
00:32:21,172 --> 00:32:25,734
Only to feel proud,
we can say we've attained freedom...

314
00:32:27,178 --> 00:32:28,975
Dear, what happened?
- lf anyone over eats...

315
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:31,648
Oh God, what happened, dear?
Someone please help. - What happened?

316
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:35,152
Fast...ls there a
doctor around?

317
00:32:35,353 --> 00:32:36,820
Quickly call the T.T.R ...
- Be here...

318
00:32:37,021 --> 00:32:37,646
l'll check whether the doctor
is there?

319
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:45,818
Doctor, l don't know what happened to
him, he is not speaking anything.

320
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:47,156
Hey, where are you going?

321
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:48,563
Sir, attend to him...

322
00:32:49,767 --> 00:32:51,166
You too...
- Leave him free.

323
00:32:57,375 --> 00:32:58,842
Nothing will happen.
Don't cry.

324
00:33:35,913 --> 00:33:37,278
ls the patient in this compartment?
- Yes doctor.

325
00:33:52,764 --> 00:33:54,061
Who gave him first aid?

326
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:57,629
We don't know who he was?
He looked like a thief.

327
00:33:57,935 --> 00:33:59,630
He is the one who gave
him first aid.

328
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:02,772
Your husband is alive because
of the first aid given by him.

329
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,908
You can continue your journey.

330
00:34:07,111 --> 00:34:09,978
l'll also prescribe a medicine.
Don't worry, be brave.

331
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:14,208
lf a man is dirty, we immediately
brand him as a thief.

332
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:19,752
We never even thanked the guy who
saved this man's life...

333
00:34:19,957 --> 00:34:21,185
What sort of people are we?

334
00:34:58,329 --> 00:35:02,129
Mr.N.Varadarajan, A.E., Kullamalai dam,
Rani malai, taluk, Melapalayam Dist.

335
00:35:06,237 --> 00:35:10,970
Oh Bamboo forests.

336
00:35:11,175 --> 00:35:15,578
Songs murmured by betels.

337
00:35:17,048 --> 00:35:28,721
Oh waterfalls! That starts from
distant hills.

338
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:23,776
Getting separated from the
lap of Mother nature,

339
00:36:23,981 --> 00:36:26,541
Losing my heart over it
for a life like this.

340
00:36:26,918 --> 00:36:33,756
l'm fed up being human, l want to
become a bird & see this world,

341
00:36:34,926 --> 00:36:38,259
By flying & flying.

342
00:37:22,974 --> 00:37:34,317
Slushy water that bears the lotus
doesn't have a fragrance but the lotus has.

343
00:37:37,054 --> 00:37:42,515
Even if the roots are cut off, the
tree won't have animus with you.

344
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:48,290
The stream carries the
flowers of the trees.

345
00:37:48,499 --> 00:37:54,460
Will l become a lotus flower
and attain salvation?

346
00:37:56,641 --> 00:38:02,443
Will l become a tree and be a
part of the human?

347
00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:11,080
Or will l become a dew drop to be
absorbed by the sun?

348
00:39:15,986 --> 00:39:21,583
Even if clouds are formed through salt
water in the sea,

349
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:27,389
The clouds does not send
back salt water.

350
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:35,232
Even if the sun sets,
it does not die,

351
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:41,073
lt transforms as a moon
& stays on.

352
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:47,241
Will l become a cloud and posses
that extraordinary features?

353
00:39:49,954 --> 00:39:55,915
Will l become a sun and
rule the world?

354
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:03,762
Will l become a rain drop
unaware of life & death?

355
00:41:13,871 --> 00:41:15,862
That's enough, give me
the newspaper.

356
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:20,868
llliterate! Moron! You buy paper
only for packing.

357
00:41:21,078 --> 00:41:21,737
What else do we buy
the paper for?

358
00:41:21,946 --> 00:41:22,571
Useless!

359
00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:25,580
Where is Mr.Varadharajan,
P.W.D Engineer's house?

360
00:41:25,783 --> 00:41:27,910
Old man, whose house is
he referring to?

361
00:41:28,452 --> 00:41:30,750
Asking about your uncle, shut up.
Where are you coming from, sir?

362
00:41:30,955 --> 00:41:31,944
l'm coming from
''Kulla malai dam''.

363
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:34,147
His office is there.

364
00:41:34,725 --> 00:41:36,317
By mistake l went...
-P.W.D Engineer's house, isn't it?

365
00:41:36,694 --> 00:41:38,252
His house is......- P.W.!

366
00:41:38,963 --> 00:41:42,023
Look if you climb & go down
the mount there...

367
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:43,792
First house of the two there.

368
00:41:44,368 --> 00:41:46,029
A literate man has directed you,
isn't it? Proceed.

369
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:51,372
Hey, what did you say for Engineer?
- P.W?

370
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:53,173
Get lost, you stupid fellow.

371
00:41:55,980 --> 00:42:01,316
Hug me..Hug me my dear...
Hug me as you please.

372
00:42:07,391 --> 00:42:12,124
l'm going to spread the cot,
hug me tightly, my dear.

373
00:42:14,131 --> 00:42:16,463
l don't have anybody to
hug except the T.V.

374
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:19,435
Within 3 months they've separated
us by giving T.V in dowry.

375
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:21,967
Akila, look how l'm
managing without you.

376
00:42:27,444 --> 00:42:30,004
l don't have side dish,
but l'll adjust.

377
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,020
Oh God! Bones!

378
00:42:41,191 --> 00:42:42,749
Some bloody fellow has come for
a share in my liquor.

379
00:42:57,708 --> 00:42:59,175
The way he is pushing me aside,
could he be a policeman?

380
00:42:59,443 --> 00:43:05,040
You're barging into my house like
P.K.S. Who're you?

381
00:43:05,549 --> 00:43:07,574
Why are you cleaning the place?
Are you a social worker?

382
00:43:07,952 --> 00:43:10,216
He is confusing me with his
''Khadi'' kurtha. Who are you?

383
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:13,287
This is my wife's photograph,
she is like your sister.

384
00:43:13,724 --> 00:43:14,383
Who's he?

385
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:16,691
Oh God! that is my dirty dhoti.

386
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:19,160
What do you think of yourself?

387
00:43:19,663 --> 00:43:21,392
l'm going to lodge a
complaint to the police.

388
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:22,864
Who do you think l am?

389
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:29,369
Hey, Chatter box!
- You're camera Thyagarajan, isn't it?

390
00:43:29,573 --> 00:43:30,437
lt's been so long...

391
00:43:30,641 --> 00:43:32,871
l couldn't identify you because l was
drunk. Don't mistake me.

392
00:43:34,178 --> 00:43:37,204
l thought.... You're still the same
confident type.

393
00:43:37,915 --> 00:43:39,280
l was shocked for a minute.

394
00:43:40,384 --> 00:43:42,875
How did you find my address?
Did our friends give it to you?

395
00:43:44,421 --> 00:43:47,720
l'm very happy to see you
after so many years.

396
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:51,390
Why're you wet? Wait, get yourself
wet inside also.

397
00:43:51,895 --> 00:43:53,920
Original Rum! Military Product.

398
00:43:54,398 --> 00:43:55,695
You don't drink, is it?

399
00:43:56,166 --> 00:43:59,363
We don't take coffee or tea in this
hill station, only rum.

400
00:43:59,737 --> 00:44:02,399
That too raw, to
feel warm.

401
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,072
Look here...

402
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:05,740
After sometime, we'll
feel warm.

403
00:44:06,043 --> 00:44:10,980
Are our school friends, Murthy,
Kumaresan & Murugasen married?

404
00:44:11,515 --> 00:44:12,880
lt is 5 years since
l got married.

405
00:44:13,083 --> 00:44:15,074
My wife is expecting, so she has
gone to her mother's house.

406
00:44:15,285 --> 00:44:19,551
Varadha, l have some
personal work here.

407
00:44:20,891 --> 00:44:25,590
So l would like to stay separately.
Will l get a room here?

408
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:27,922
You want to stay
separately, is it?

409
00:44:28,899 --> 00:44:30,264
Don't make me angry.

410
00:44:32,469 --> 00:44:34,266
Then, why did you come in
search of me?

411
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:36,472
There is no point in
our being friends.

412
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:37,772
You're staying with me.

413
00:44:39,143 --> 00:44:40,872
lt will take three months
for my wife to come back.

414
00:44:41,078 --> 00:44:42,340
Even l'm a bachelor till then.
So feel free to live here.

415
00:44:44,448 --> 00:44:47,212
Buddy, somebody is at the door.
Let me check.

416
00:44:47,418 --> 00:44:48,942
Change your clothes,
you're wet.

417
00:44:50,387 --> 00:44:51,786
Who the hell is banging
the door at midnight?

418
00:44:52,089 --> 00:44:53,920
Will he be a classmate
or a glass mate?

419
00:44:55,159 --> 00:44:56,319
Oh Devil!

420
00:44:56,994 --> 00:44:58,689
lt's me Varadha.
- Oh !Aunty! ls it you?

421
00:44:59,163 --> 00:45:01,154
l've run out of gas halfway
through my cooking.

422
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:03,629
l came to you for an additional
cylinder if you've.

423
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:09,196
What are you doing in the dark?

424
00:45:12,109 --> 00:45:14,475
Aunty wanted an extra cylinder,
that's why l'm removing this.

425
00:45:14,678 --> 00:45:15,576
Tyagu, give me a hand.

426
00:45:16,146 --> 00:45:17,807
Don't remove that,
you might die.

427
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:19,314
Extra cylinder is over here.

428
00:45:19,516 --> 00:45:21,643
Oh yes, if one is connected,
other will be free, isn't it?

429
00:45:21,919 --> 00:45:23,750
Since my wife isn't here...
That's why l asked you not to drink.

430
00:45:23,954 --> 00:45:24,648
You've drunk it raw and
you're taking my life out.

431
00:45:25,756 --> 00:45:27,087
You should have it raw
in the night.

432
00:45:28,192 --> 00:45:30,183
Carry the cylinder carefully.

433
00:45:30,461 --> 00:45:32,520
Aunty, he is my friend.

434
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:35,327
Don't mistake him to be a
cylinder delivery boy.

435
00:45:35,999 --> 00:45:39,560
You go forward, we'll bring
the cylinder carefully.

436
00:45:40,704 --> 00:45:42,934
Be careful, it is very slippery.
- You go carefully.

437
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:45,165
lt won't look nice if l
come inside as l'm drunk.

438
00:45:45,442 --> 00:45:46,670
Kindly connect the
cylinder for her.

439
00:45:51,482 --> 00:45:54,315
What is this, you're cooking
without cleaning the fish.

440
00:45:55,152 --> 00:45:55,948
Should the fish be cleaned?

441
00:45:56,153 --> 00:45:57,518
Yes, it should be cleaned.

442
00:45:57,721 --> 00:45:59,018
100 preparations of fish.

443
00:45:59,623 --> 00:46:01,989
l'm a vegetarian, my husband
is a non-vegetarian.

444
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:05,187
Do you know it's how many
years since we're married?

445
00:46:05,496 --> 00:46:08,465
But he has never asked me to
cook non-vegetarian even once!

446
00:46:09,032 --> 00:46:13,628
Since he loves fish,
l wanted to learn...

447
00:46:13,837 --> 00:46:14,701
That's not difficult at all.

448
00:46:15,205 --> 00:46:16,968
Just as you peel the
skin of raw plantain,

449
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:18,673
lt is the same with fish also.

450
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:22,177
First take the fish &
chop its head.

451
00:46:24,248 --> 00:46:24,839
Like this...

452
00:46:27,251 --> 00:46:28,809
Then, chop the tail.

453
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:34,214
Then, remove the scales like you do
for a raw plantain. - That's all.

454
00:46:34,558 --> 00:46:36,719
Wash it, add 'masala'
& then fry it.

455
00:46:50,941 --> 00:46:52,670
Varadhan, why are you
standing outside?

456
00:46:53,777 --> 00:46:54,402
Come, lets go in.

457
00:46:55,379 --> 00:46:57,370
Are you drunk? - No, l
smoked a cigarette.

458
00:46:57,581 --> 00:46:59,048
l'll inform your wife.
- Sir don't...Please.

459
00:46:59,249 --> 00:47:01,046
Your wife is in Dharmapuri,
isn't it?

460
00:47:01,285 --> 00:47:02,081
l'll make a call right away.

461
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:04,911
Sir, you're staying with your wife,
but l'm alone.

462
00:47:05,122 --> 00:47:06,419
Does that mean you
should drink?

463
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:10,820
l'm getting fish smell.
Did you take fish?

464
00:47:11,061 --> 00:47:12,585
l never had anything solid,
l took only liquid.

465
00:47:12,796 --> 00:47:14,093
The aroma of fish is from here.

466
00:47:14,298 --> 00:47:14,923
Aunty!

467
00:47:20,237 --> 00:47:22,205
Wow! A vegetarian woman has
cooked non-vegetarian.

468
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:23,404
Gayathri, did you cook this?

469
00:47:23,807 --> 00:47:25,206
l didn't, his friend
prepared it.

470
00:47:25,409 --> 00:47:27,843
Who? - He is my
friend Thyagarajan.

471
00:47:28,045 --> 00:47:30,445
Don't take him to be a cook because
he has cooked non-vegetarian.

472
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:33,612
We are bosom friends
& neighbours.

473
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:36,342
We studied together in
the same school & class.

474
00:47:36,753 --> 00:47:38,345
He is here to meet me
after a long time.

475
00:47:38,956 --> 00:47:40,685
Because of his benevolence,
we've non-veg. today.

476
00:47:44,995 --> 00:47:45,984
l wanted to thank you
there itself.

477
00:47:47,664 --> 00:47:48,460
But, l couldn't find you.

478
00:47:55,672 --> 00:47:57,697
Sir, l've got a job in the dam.
Do you know, what it is?

479
00:47:58,041 --> 00:48:00,532
lf l bring fish, crab & snails
for aunty,

480
00:48:00,777 --> 00:48:03,268
She will cook them deliciously for us.
l'll meet you all with crabs.

481
00:48:33,176 --> 00:48:34,939
This is Vishal's test papers.
She's on leave today.

482
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:37,471
Can you give this to her?

483
00:48:37,814 --> 00:48:39,111
l've never been to
Vishal's house.

484
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:41,281
She stays in your area, isn't it?
Enquire & deliver it.

485
00:49:10,347 --> 00:49:12,315
l invited you home several times,
did you ever come?

486
00:49:14,351 --> 00:49:15,147
What shooting?

487
00:49:15,686 --> 00:49:18,985
l'm the V.J of V.channel's
lndian programme.

488
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:20,748
V.J means?

489
00:49:29,566 --> 00:49:30,828
Wow!

490
00:49:38,542 --> 00:49:39,668
They're all my L.Ds.

491
00:49:39,876 --> 00:49:40,808
Select whichever you want.

492
00:49:41,011 --> 00:49:41,875
Watch it and give it back
to me later.

493
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:43,341
No...lt's alright.

494
00:49:45,882 --> 00:49:46,849
You've the player, isn't it?

495
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:48,779
Yes, l've...
lt's not working.

496
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:49,645
What's that
in your hand?

497
00:49:50,854 --> 00:49:51,786
They gave our the test papers which
we wrote last week.

498
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:53,684
That's why l came here to
give them.

499
00:49:53,957 --> 00:49:56,255
You're always seen
in school uniform.

500
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:58,291
Do you also sleep
in this uniform?

501
00:49:58,495 --> 00:49:59,928
My Appa(father) Aatha(mother)

502
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:03,261
Both Appa and Aatha is it?

503
00:50:03,567 --> 00:50:06,263
No...l meant my grandmother,
my father's mother.

504
00:50:11,608 --> 00:50:12,802
Hey, have it, nothing will

508
00:50:45,342 --> 00:50:46,673
Hey, this is just

509
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:49,038
Don't avoid coming here just because
of this. You've to come here.

510
00:50:49,246 --> 00:50:50,235
You'll come, isn't it?

You've to come

512
00:50:58,221 --> 00:50:59,848
Oh God!

513
00:51:00,357 --> 00:51:02,018
As soon as my grand-daughter
attains puberty,

514
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:06,594
l had taken a vow that l'll offer you
pongal and do all the rituals.

515
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:09,491
l couldn't fulfill it.

516
00:51:10,867 --> 00:51:14,564
Within the forth coming new moon
l'll fulfill all the vows.

517
00:51:17,007 --> 00:51:18,440
This oldie is sickening to us.

518
00:51:18,642 --> 00:51:19,472
Children's education are
getting spoiled.

519
00:51:19,676 --> 00:51:20,802
Won't anyone of you
question her?

520
00:51:25,682 --> 00:51:26,842
This oldie is sickening.

521
00:51:27,050 --> 00:51:28,813
She'll start fighting with us
if we say something.

522
00:51:29,019 --> 00:51:30,281
She doesn't have brains
at all.

523
00:51:30,487 --> 00:51:31,454
What to do?

524
00:51:46,336 --> 00:51:49,499
Deivannai, please sit down here
...Sit.

525
00:51:54,845 --> 00:52:00,306
Oh God, protect her in whichever
direction she goes.

526
00:52:01,985 --> 00:52:07,252
Oh Goddess...Give them happiness by
being with them.

00:52:07,891 --> 00:52:08,949
Without letting any evil spirits

00:52:09,726 --> 00:52:10,818
Without letting her to suffer
from any diseases,

529
00:52:11,328 --> 00:52:12,795
God and Goddess, protect her.

530
00:52:15,065 --> 00:52:18,057
Because of the broken bridge,
86 people including children have died.

531
00:52:18,268 --> 00:52:19,326
Sinners!

532
00:52:19,536 --> 00:52:20,560
Was there any fraud involved during the
construction of the bridge?

533
00:52:20,770 --> 00:52:23,637
Case has been filed in the court
against Ex. l.A.S officer Rajeswaran?

534
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:28,675
Don't take revenge against
the officer of our caste.

00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:57,432
This court permits him to go out of
station for Naturopathy treatment.

541
00:52:58,241 --> 00:53:02,507
Why're you always postponing this
case for various reasons?

542
00:53:02,712 --> 00:53:04,577
Can you give us a copy of the medical
report submitted in the court?

543
00:53:04,781 --> 00:53:06,214
What's wrong with your
father's health?

544
00:53:06,583 --> 00:53:07,481
Don't disturb!

545
00:53:07,684 --> 00:53:10,380
Withdraw the case against
Ex l.A.S officer.

546

How come all the convicts have
some disease or the other?

547
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:15,556
Really, can't you talk?

548

Answer us and then go.

549
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:19,025
What did that lady
reporter question?

Has sir come?
- There he's going.

00:54:40,543 --> 00:54:42,067
What's this? Did he pretend

558
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:43,109
Was it a drama, sir?

559
00:54:43,313 --> 00:54:44,974
Hey, why're you so dumb?

560
00:54:45,181 --> 00:54:45,977

561
00:54:46,216 --> 00:54:47,444

Where's the A/c car?

569

Our lawyer has sent
a car for us.

570
00:55:05,535 --> 00:55:06,502
Then, what's this ambulance for?

571
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:07,701
Pandiyan, please come.

572
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:10,337
Sir, he'll do anything
you ask for.

00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:11,632
He's very good person.

574
00:55:12,442 --> 00:55:14,273
That is why he has brought
this ambulance?

575
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:22,042
Okay, were you posted directly
or after promotion?

576
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:32,587
Why're you fighting with him
on the first meeting itself?

577
00:55:41,371 --> 00:55:43,896
''RANl MALAl GlVES YOU
A WARM WELCOME''

578
00:55:44,274 --> 00:55:48,540
Ex l.A.S officer Rajeswaran who had
worked in many departments,

579
00:55:48,745 --> 00:55:54,581
ls owning properties worth
millions through fraud.

580
00:55:54,784 --> 00:55:58,982
Misusing his official positions in
Government undertakings,

581
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:01,054
Namely construction of bridges,

582
00:56:01,257 --> 00:56:04,715
He has taken a commission of
atleast 20 crores... - Hey...

583
00:56:05,095 --> 00:56:07,086
There are people who
are worst than us.

584
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:09,025
lf we go to the north.

585
00:56:09,232 --> 00:56:12,133
We may find that they've looted
a sum of 900-1000 crores.

586
00:56:12,335 --> 00:56:14,769
Hey, what'll they do with
so much of money?

587
00:56:14,971 --> 00:56:16,370
They'll fry papads,
get lost man.

588
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:18,771
l'm worried when l
read this.

589
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:22,736
They're going to the court after
scamming on the taxes which we pay...

590
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:26,181
As if they're coming back from
their concubines house,

591
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:28,078
They're giving poses in the
police van happily.

592
00:56:28,284 --> 00:56:30,013
You people aren't dare to
question them.

593
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:31,346
But you people are kidding.

594
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:35,547
lnstead of having a sickle, you're
roaming with lottery tickets.

595
00:56:35,759 --> 00:56:38,353
Aren't you ashamed? Will this
country get reformed? Phew...

596
00:56:45,135 --> 00:56:46,966
Oh God, what's this?

597
00:56:47,170 --> 00:56:47,966
Shouldn't you be careful
while working.

598

Please sit down for a while,
you can work later.

599
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:51,698
Be quiet, we can't survive if we
give importance to this.

600
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:52,897
You go and carry our child.

601
00:57:30,013 --> 00:57:31,139
What happened?
- Nothing.

602
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:36,111

604
00:58:28,371 --> 00:58:30,737
You're going to dance

605
00:58:31,074 --> 00:58:32,371
Oh God! No...

Between this sandal wood fragrance

What father? - Take that cigarette

654

My son wants it, so find a young deer
& arrange it within an hour.

664
01:06:16,472 --> 01:06:17,439
Sir, you're an l.A.S officer.

665
01:06:18,074 --> 01:06:19,268
You were the secretary for
the Ministry of Forest.

wild animals.

Hey, which is a crime?

669
01:06:25,815 --> 01:06:27,783
lf 2 cars dash each other,
it's an incident.

670
01:06:28,317 --> 01:06:29,944
lt becomes an accident only
when we file a complaint.

671
01:06:30,753 --> 01:06:32,277
lf you slaughter the deer
and prepare it,

672
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:34,289
Will the mother deer lodge
a complaint?

673
01:06:34,590 --> 01:06:36,615
Or, will you leave the peeled
skin without burning?

674
01:06:37,493 --> 01:06:38,790
Do l've to teach
you all this?

675
01:06:40,096 --> 01:06:41,461
Sir, this isn't fair.
Leave me!

676
01:06:46,669 --> 01:06:48,296
l used to have breakfast
in D.G.P's house,

677
01:06:48,504 --> 01:06:50,131
And coffee in Governor's house.

678
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:53,468
Every officer will comply
to my gestures.

679
01:06:53,843 --> 01:06:55,640
They won't question me nor
they'll stand infront of me like this.

680
01:06:56,278 --> 01:06:57,643
Even after completing
20 years of service.

681
01:06:58,180 --> 01:06:59,647
l don't think you're reformed.

682
01:07:00,349 --> 01:07:01,816
After being posted as A.S.P.,

683
01:07:02,184 --> 01:07:03,651
You've been receiving charge memos
in tandem.

684
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:07,319
So you're still an A.S.P without
being promoted.

685
01:07:08,524 --> 01:07:11,152
Are you wondering how l'm saying your
service records upto date?

686
01:07:12,695 --> 01:07:13,491
That's l.A.S

687
01:07:15,197 --> 01:07:15,993
Will you arrange it?

688
01:07:16,866 --> 01:07:18,663
What else do you want, man?
- Liquor, father.

689
01:07:19,201 --> 01:07:20,828
Hey, if l ask him to buy
betel leaves.

690
01:07:21,037 --> 01:07:22,163
That even includes white lime.

691
01:07:22,872 --> 01:07:23,998
ls he brainless?

692
01:07:26,375 --> 01:07:27,000
What Pandian?

693
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:34,679
Don't stiffen up like a
well starched uniform.

694
01:07:35,484 --> 01:07:37,349
Stop acting smart and
do what l say.

695
01:07:46,395 --> 01:07:48,022
Sir, what's it? What
did he say?

696
01:08:19,261 --> 01:08:20,888
Why's he coming here without
going to his house?

697
01:08:22,932 --> 01:08:24,229
Why's he tensed?

698
01:08:26,268 --> 01:08:26,734
Sit down!

699
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:29,734
Give me a cigarrate.
- Cigarrate for you?

700
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:30,731
Give me, man.

701
01:08:33,609 --> 01:08:34,576
What's it? What happened?

702
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:36,078
Why're you in
an off mood?

703
01:08:40,549 --> 01:08:42,574
Even though he's an l.A.S officer,
he's still an accused.

704
01:08:43,252 --> 01:08:44,549
Now he's under police custody
after committing frauds.

705
01:08:45,287 --> 01:08:46,754
lt seems he wants deer's flesh
and arrack.

706
01:08:47,123 --> 01:08:47,748
He's asking me!

707
01:08:48,457 --> 01:08:50,755
l've bashed people who stole
for their hunger.

708
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:53,261
He has swindled people's money.

709
01:08:53,629 --> 01:08:55,426
But l'm supposed to serve him
with folded hands.

710
01:08:56,298 --> 01:08:56,923
Do l've to deserve this?

711
01:08:57,566 --> 01:08:58,760
lt's a shame!

712
01:08:59,135 --> 01:09:00,261
l can understand your anger.

713
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:01,766
What to do?

714
01:09:02,471 --> 01:09:07,204
Only because of big shots support,
they're talking very boldly.

715
01:09:07,409 --> 01:09:09,274
We'll feel like slapping them when
they talk like this.

716
01:09:09,478 --> 01:09:11,446
lf you rub him on
the wrong side,

717
01:09:11,647 --> 01:09:13,444
At the next moment, an auto'll be
parked infront of your house.

718
01:09:13,816 --> 01:09:14,612
They'll pour acid on you.

719
01:09:14,817 --> 01:09:16,114
They'll throw stones
and bottles on you.

720
01:09:16,652 --> 01:09:18,119
Atleast you'll receive a
transfer order.

721
01:09:18,888 --> 01:09:21,118
Sir, Don't get tensed,
be patient.

722
01:09:22,992 --> 01:09:24,960
What're you saying? Do you
want me to be patient?

723
01:09:26,495 --> 01:09:26,961
Where's Thyagu?

724
01:09:27,997 --> 01:09:29,965
He has gone to take
tuitions for small children.

725
01:09:32,168 --> 01:09:33,795
Who doesn't have
problems?

726
01:09:34,336 --> 01:09:35,462
First relax.

727
01:11:01,657 --> 01:11:02,487
Who put off the fire?

728
01:11:21,810 --> 01:11:22,777
l'm going to tell him
that's impossible.

729
01:11:23,812 --> 01:11:24,540
Let anything happen!

730
01:11:45,167 --> 01:11:47,294
Hey, who's that lying on Sir's
cot disrespectfully?

731
01:11:48,504 --> 01:11:50,131
Get up...Get up...

732
01:12:06,355 --> 01:12:07,481
204, give me a pen.

733
01:12:27,376 --> 01:12:29,674
Wait...l'll go and come back
- Come fast.

734
01:12:46,228 --> 01:12:47,195
Are you in full booze?
- l had a peg.

735
01:12:54,403 --> 01:12:55,529
Who's that?

736
01:13:17,593 --> 01:13:18,389
Where's your father?

737
01:13:21,597 --> 01:13:22,222
He's bathing.

738
01:13:38,614 --> 01:13:40,912
Hey, has Pandian brought
the deer's flesh?

739
01:13:53,128 --> 01:13:53,594
Hey, who's there?

740
01:13:54,963 --> 01:13:55,429
What's happening there?

741
01:15:28,390 --> 01:15:30,688
What happened?
- Someone...Father.

742
01:15:31,059 --> 01:15:31,684
What happened to
your father?

743
01:15:32,227 --> 01:15:32,852
Someone...Father...

744
01:15:40,235 --> 01:15:40,701
Soon.

745
01:16:20,442 --> 01:16:22,069
Block all the vehicles
which go this way.

746
01:16:51,473 --> 01:16:52,098
Do it fast.

747
01:17:48,196 --> 01:17:49,993
Thief cheated...

748
01:17:50,365 --> 01:17:53,163
Thyagu, l received a phone call
from my kinswoman.

749
01:17:53,535 --> 01:17:54,661
My wife is going to
deliver a child.

750
01:17:55,037 --> 01:17:56,334
l'll come back in 4 days.

751
01:18:03,045 --> 01:18:09,507
Police was cheated by
the thief.

752
01:18:14,222 --> 01:18:17,350
Brother, active and passive voice
are right, isn't it?

753
01:18:19,561 --> 01:18:20,027
Yes!

754
01:18:25,734 --> 01:18:27,201
Where did they go?
Don't know.

755
01:18:27,569 --> 01:18:29,196
Why did they kidnap him?
Don't know.

756
01:18:29,838 --> 01:18:31,533
But, when asked how did
they kidnap him,

757
01:18:31,740 --> 01:18:32,866
You've given me the report
in 8 pages.

758
01:18:33,075 --> 01:18:34,201
Who needs your report, man?

759
01:18:35,410 --> 01:18:37,037
lt seems you weren't in the
spot at that time.

760
01:18:37,245 --> 01:18:38,041
Where did you go?

761
01:18:38,747 --> 01:18:39,372
Sir, he...

762
01:18:40,415 --> 01:18:41,040
Tell me!

763
01:18:44,152 --> 01:18:45,050
Sir, l went home and...

764
01:18:45,587 --> 01:18:48,055
Were you lacing your wife's
in skirt at home,

765
01:18:49,091 --> 01:18:50,888
Or were you playing dice?

766
01:18:51,259 --> 01:18:51,725
What did you do?

767
01:18:51,927 --> 01:18:57,229
Now l feel that you've some link
with the kidnappers.

768
01:19:00,435 --> 01:19:02,062
Sir's wife has called up
from Rani malai.

769
01:19:02,270 --> 01:19:03,396
lt seems she wants to talk
to him urgently.

770
01:19:04,272 --> 01:19:06,399
Hey, l know everything.

771
01:19:07,609 --> 01:19:11,238
Hey, you had misbehaved with
Mr.Rajeswaran right from the beginning,

772
01:19:12,114 --> 01:19:12,739
ls it true or false?

773
01:19:14,950 --> 01:19:16,247
That's different and
this is different.

774
01:19:18,453 --> 01:19:21,422
Government pays your salary,

775
01:19:22,457 --> 01:19:23,924
So, be dutiful to them.

776
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:29,090
Politicians bribe you with
bags of money,

777
01:19:30,132 --> 01:19:31,599
So, be trustworthy to them.

778
01:19:32,634 --> 01:19:36,092
Look we've to save him without
even a small scratch.

779
01:19:36,972 --> 01:19:38,098
This should happen.

780
01:19:38,473 --> 01:19:42,603
lf this doesn't happen,
then commit suicide, man.

781
01:19:49,651 --> 01:19:50,618
What Gayathri?
What's so urgent?

782
01:19:50,819 --> 01:19:51,444
Tell it soon!

783
01:19:51,987 --> 01:19:52,612
Why're you getting angry?

784
01:19:52,988 --> 01:19:55,616
lt seems Deiva has boarded
a train last night.

785
01:19:55,924 --> 01:19:56,948
So she called up
on the way.

786
01:19:57,159 --> 01:19:58,626
Within an hour, the train will
reach here.

787
01:19:58,827 --> 01:19:59,953
She should be picked up from the
station, isn't it?

788
01:20:00,162 --> 01:20:00,719
That's why, l called you.

789
01:20:00,929 --> 01:20:02,487
What's this? Why should she
start suddenly?

790
01:20:02,731 --> 01:20:03,459
With whose permission is
she coming here?

791
01:20:03,665 --> 01:20:04,461
Why should she come here?

792
01:20:04,666 --> 01:20:06,463
l don't know the reason.
She spoke in a hurry.

793
01:20:06,668 --> 01:20:08,295
l thought of asking her later,
so l didn't ask her anything now.

794
01:20:09,271 --> 01:20:10,295
Gayathri, l'm in a fix.

795
01:20:13,341 --> 01:20:15,775
No...She must be picked up from the
station, isn't it? That's why. - Okay.

796
01:20:24,686 --> 01:20:25,311
Give me a ticket
to Cochin.

797
01:20:38,033 --> 01:20:38,829
When'll the Cochin
express arrive?

798
01:21:08,563 --> 01:21:09,530
Journey is over.

799
01:21:10,732 --> 01:21:12,359
Captive in safe custody.

800
01:21:14,736 --> 01:21:16,033
Can you do me a favour?

801
01:21:16,404 --> 01:21:17,871
My daughter is coming by
Cochin express from Madras.

802
01:21:18,073 --> 01:21:19,040
l came here to pick her up.

803
01:21:19,407 --> 01:21:21,375
But l received an important message,
so l've to leave immediately.

804
01:21:21,743 --> 01:21:23,210
Can you pick her up and
drop her home?

805
01:21:27,015 --> 01:21:27,879
You've not seen her,
isn't it?

806
01:21:29,417 --> 01:21:31,214
This is her photo...
Have a look at her.

807
01:21:33,321 --> 01:21:33,878
Come fast.

808
01:21:38,093 --> 01:21:39,060
Who am l?

809
01:21:41,763 --> 01:21:45,392
How are we both related?

810
01:22:44,192 --> 01:22:44,658
Get down.

811
01:22:46,027 --> 01:22:46,493
Get in.

812
01:22:48,029 --> 01:22:48,825
Will you show me your bag?

813
01:22:49,030 --> 01:22:50,497
He's friend of A.S.P.

814
01:22:50,699 --> 01:22:52,326
He has come to receive
his daughter.

815
01:22:52,534 --> 01:22:53,660
You can carry on...
-Carry on...

816
01:22:54,369 --> 01:22:55,666
Get in...

817
01:23:11,987 --> 01:23:13,852
l'm Thyagu, your father's friend.

818
01:23:14,723 --> 01:23:16,190
He came to receive you.

819
01:23:16,725 --> 01:23:18,522
He went away since he had to
attend an important matter.

820
01:23:19,227 --> 01:23:21,354
So he asked me to drop
you in your house.

821
01:23:21,730 --> 01:23:22,856
Shall we go?...Come.

822
01:23:26,401 --> 01:23:27,026
Has she arrived?

823
01:23:27,902 --> 01:23:29,028
Come madam.
-Greetings.

824
01:23:29,404 --> 01:23:31,031
Shall l arrange for a Jeep?

825
01:23:31,406 --> 01:23:32,703
No need. lt's okay.
-Okay.

826
01:24:01,770 --> 01:24:03,067
You were on duty last night
isn't it? -Yes sir...

827
01:24:03,271 --> 01:24:04,898
How could've they escaped
without your knowledge?

828
01:24:05,106 --> 01:24:06,733
l swear, l don't know anything.
l was fast asleep.

829
01:24:07,275 --> 01:24:08,242
Tell me the truth.
-Don't beat me.

830
01:24:08,443 --> 01:24:09,569
l'll break your legs. Tell me...

831
01:24:09,778 --> 01:24:10,574
l'm telling you the truth.
-Tell me..

832
01:24:10,779 --> 01:24:11,404
Won't you tell me or not?
-Tell me...

833
01:24:34,636 --> 01:24:35,603
Sir, phone call from D.l.G.

834
01:24:36,805 --> 01:24:38,102
What did l tell you?

835
01:24:39,140 --> 01:24:39,936
And what're you doing?

836
01:24:40,141 --> 01:24:42,109
Sir, l've got a small
clue from...

837
01:24:42,310 --> 01:24:43,937
Hey, have you arrested anyone?

838
01:24:44,312 --> 01:24:44,778
No Sir.

839
01:24:45,146 --> 01:24:47,444
l'm receiving faxes from
higher officials.

840
01:24:48,149 --> 01:24:49,446
What happened to the
enquiry report?

841
01:24:49,984 --> 01:24:51,952
l'm preparing the report based
on the information l've got.

842
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:53,116
Shut up.

843
01:24:53,822 --> 01:24:56,450
Come to my office immediately
with the report.

844
01:24:56,991 --> 01:24:58,288
The report is not yet complete.

845
01:24:58,660 --> 01:24:59,627
l've got a new clue...

846
01:25:15,510 --> 01:25:15,976
Hubby....

847
01:25:19,013 --> 01:25:20,310
Hubby, look at her.

848
01:25:20,682 --> 01:25:22,479
She's gloomy since she came here.

849
01:25:22,684 --> 01:25:23,480
Ask her, what are her problems?

850
01:25:23,852 --> 01:25:25,649
Why're you walking out while
l'm talking?

851
01:25:25,854 --> 01:25:26,980
What important work do you've?

852
01:25:28,356 --> 01:25:29,323
What do you think of yourselves?

853
01:25:29,858 --> 01:25:30,654
She'll do anything she likes.

854
01:25:30,859 --> 01:25:32,486
Am l in a position to listen
to your problems?

855
01:25:33,528 --> 01:25:35,155
Hey, what's the problem between
you & the old lady?

856
01:25:35,864 --> 01:25:36,831
Why don't you both adjust
with each other?

857
01:25:37,532 --> 01:25:38,658
Won't you listen to your elders?

858
01:25:39,868 --> 01:25:40,994
After hurting that old
lady's feelings,

859
01:25:41,202 --> 01:25:42,760
Has she come here to attend
any funeral?

860
01:25:43,204 --> 01:25:45,570
lf she had died on the way,
l would've performed her obsequious.

861
01:25:46,708 --> 01:25:47,675
What kind of a girl have
you given birth to?

862
01:25:48,209 --> 01:25:49,506
Are you behaving like a father?

863
01:25:49,878 --> 01:25:52,005
Why do you need a wife & daughter?

864
01:25:53,882 --> 01:25:55,179
What're you going to achieve
by working like this?

865
01:25:55,383 --> 01:25:56,350
Hey, what're you talking?

866
01:25:57,886 --> 01:25:58,352
Leave me...

867
01:25:58,720 --> 01:25:59,186
No...No...

868
01:26:00,388 --> 01:26:00,854
Leave me, Thyagu.

869
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:07,687
What's this, why're you
beating her?

870
01:26:08,563 --> 01:26:09,029
lt's wrong.

871
01:26:09,397 --> 01:26:10,421
What can l do, Thyagu?

872
01:26:10,832 --> 01:26:12,026
Someone has kidnapped the Minister.

873
01:26:12,567 --> 01:26:13,864
lf l catch him, l'll....

874
01:26:14,502 --> 01:26:16,527
But before that, higher officials
are torturing me.

875
01:26:16,905 --> 01:26:18,873
Should l answer them or
should l solve her problems?

876
01:26:19,741 --> 01:26:21,038
Each one of them are making me to...

877
01:26:39,594 --> 01:26:42,722
When a volcano erupts
few flowers will get burnt.

878
01:26:43,865 --> 01:26:46,891
Burnt flowers will become manure
for the new plants.

879
01:26:47,602 --> 01:26:50,571
When we are destroying the polluted
forest which ruins our country.

880
01:26:51,439 --> 01:26:55,068
Bird's nests will also be destroyed and
it can't be avoided.

881
01:26:56,277 --> 01:26:57,904
lt's injustice if we hesitate.

882
01:28:05,513 --> 01:28:06,639
Leave me alone.

883
01:28:08,850 --> 01:28:10,317
lf you've come here only to cry.

884
01:28:11,185 --> 01:28:11,981
l'll wait.

885
01:28:12,687 --> 01:28:13,312
Finish crying.

886
01:28:14,022 --> 01:28:14,647
Who are you?

887
01:28:15,857 --> 01:28:18,155
Why should l tell you about why l'm here
and what l'm going to do?

888
01:28:19,527 --> 01:28:21,995
lt's my wish to live or die.

889
01:28:23,197 --> 01:28:24,323
What do you know about me?

890
01:28:25,033 --> 01:28:25,499
l know.

891
01:28:27,201 --> 01:28:28,828
l've seen you before.

892
01:28:29,704 --> 01:28:32,002
l know the punishment you gave to the
person who brushed you in the bus.

893
01:28:33,641 --> 01:28:35,666
l had also seen your mischievous acts.

894
01:28:37,879 --> 01:28:43,010
l had also seen you giving charity
when others were not bothered.

895
01:28:43,885 --> 01:28:45,182
That was the real Deiva.

896
01:28:46,554 --> 01:28:47,851
You are not what you were.

897
01:28:50,058 --> 01:28:51,355
You've some other problems.

898
01:28:51,893 --> 01:28:52,860
l don't know what it is.

899
01:28:53,561 --> 01:28:57,190
You are unable to tell your
problems to others.

900
01:28:57,398 --> 01:28:59,195
But, you've come here only
to reveal them.

901
01:28:59,901 --> 01:29:01,528
This is not the place or
time for that.

902
01:29:02,403 --> 01:29:03,700
Come, we'll go home.

903
01:29:36,104 --> 01:29:39,562
l don't know whether my problem will be
solved if l tell you.

904
01:29:40,041 --> 01:29:43,067
But, l feel like telling you.

905
01:29:44,445 --> 01:29:46,413
Me and Vishal from French class...

906
01:30:43,504 --> 01:30:44,300
Why're they lying like this?

907
01:30:53,347 --> 01:30:54,143
Nothing happened, isn't it?

908
01:30:54,348 --> 01:30:55,474
Why're you making a mess of it?

909
01:31:00,688 --> 01:31:01,154
Yuck!

910
01:31:05,860 --> 01:31:11,492
My father, mother & grandma wanted me
to study well & come up in life.

911
01:31:13,534 --> 01:31:16,833
But l...

912
01:31:18,039 --> 01:31:19,006
What can l do?

913
01:31:21,042 --> 01:31:22,339
What're you crying for?

914
01:31:23,478 --> 01:31:24,172
You shouldn't cry.

915
01:31:25,880 --> 01:31:28,849
There's nothing wrong if we wish
to walk on mountain paths.

916
01:31:29,884 --> 01:31:33,342
lt's idiotic to wish that there
should be no thorns.

917
01:31:34,222 --> 01:31:35,018
They will be there.

918
01:31:36,557 --> 01:31:42,359
We breathe in Oxygen & breathe out dirt.
This is the process of life.

919
01:31:43,731 --> 01:31:45,358
Both are necessary for our survival.

920
01:31:46,734 --> 01:31:49,202
Every experience we've
in our life is a test.

921
01:31:49,904 --> 01:31:51,872
Each of it will teach us a lesson.

922
01:31:53,574 --> 01:31:56,543
We must feel happy, if we
get good experience.

923
01:31:58,079 --> 01:32:01,810
We must get matured when
we face worst experience.

924
01:32:03,251 --> 01:32:08,052
This has made you to
understand your strength.

925
01:32:09,757 --> 01:32:11,554
lt made you to know about
your culture.

926
01:32:13,194 --> 01:32:14,718
You must thank this experience.

927
01:32:15,429 --> 01:32:18,398
But you shouldn't cry, Deiva.

928
01:32:41,122 --> 01:32:46,082
Grandma...-Dear.

929
01:32:46,294 --> 01:32:48,262
Why did you leave me & come here?

930
01:32:48,462 --> 01:32:50,930
lf l had committed any mistake...
-Oh No!

931
01:32:51,132 --> 01:32:52,599
l had committed the mistake.
-Oh No!

932
01:32:53,467 --> 01:32:56,766
l had committed the mistake.

933
01:33:05,980 --> 01:33:07,106
Come, we'll go in.

934
01:33:07,648 --> 01:33:08,444
l've come, isn't it?

935
01:33:08,649 --> 01:33:10,776
Grandma, l won't do like this hereafter.

936
01:33:20,328 --> 01:33:22,455
Are the bells ringing in my heart?

937
01:33:25,833 --> 01:33:28,131
ls it a snow fall in my heart?

938
01:33:45,519 --> 01:33:50,479
Electricity is passing through
a tender flower.

939
01:33:51,359 --> 01:33:55,989
And swallowing me

940
01:33:56,864 --> 01:34:00,664
There is no sweet pain like this.

941
01:34:02,536 --> 01:34:06,336
But still there's no
way we can lie.

942
01:34:47,748 --> 01:34:53,880
Who is playing saxophone
in my heart?

943
01:34:56,090 --> 01:35:02,552
Who first opened your heart?

944
01:35:04,598 --> 01:35:08,056
ls he a young lad pinching
my heart?

945
01:35:09,770 --> 01:35:13,900
ls he a thief stealing my eyelids?

946
01:35:15,776 --> 01:35:20,907
ls he an artist who adds
colours to my dreams?

947
01:35:21,449 --> 01:35:24,077
Planets are revolving
around the universe.

948
01:35:24,285 --> 01:35:27,083
When you think of me
sufferings disappear.

949
01:36:09,663 --> 01:36:12,427
The report on the sample flesh
given to the lab, has come.

950
01:36:13,167 --> 01:36:18,469
Based on tissue analysis, it is said
that he would be between 25-30 years.

951
01:36:18,773 --> 01:36:21,469
Then, his blood group is B +ve.

952
01:36:22,176 --> 01:36:25,475
What happened to Mr.Rajeswaran's report?
-His blood group is A +ve.

953
01:36:26,847 --> 01:36:29,975
After studying the report of the
kidnapped people.

954
01:36:30,351 --> 01:36:32,649
lt is confirmed that many cases
are pending against them.

955
01:36:32,853 --> 01:36:37,483
Not only that, all 6 people have been
jailed in some cases.

956
01:36:37,858 --> 01:36:40,827
But, they've escaped by filing appeals
in the High Court.

957
01:36:41,195 --> 01:36:44,824
l think that this strange way of
kidnapping will continue.

958
01:36:46,534 --> 01:36:48,832
One way to catch him is with the
help of evidences.

959
01:36:50,037 --> 01:36:52,005
Another way is to lay a trap.

960
01:36:52,706 --> 01:36:57,507
l've collected a list of Politicians
who are dodging the court.

961
01:36:58,212 --> 01:37:01,841
Ex-Health Minister Mr.lnbaraj
is popular in all medias.

962
01:37:02,550 --> 01:37:03,517
This is also a guess work.

963
01:37:03,884 --> 01:37:06,352
How can we be so confident that
he'll be their next target?

964
01:37:07,488 --> 01:37:10,355
Sometimes guess may
become a trap for them.

965
01:37:11,559 --> 01:37:12,184
Where is Mr.lnbaraj now?

966
01:37:12,726 --> 01:37:14,193
He is in Kovai Pudur
Government Hospital.

967
01:37:15,563 --> 01:37:16,530
Look Rajamanickam...

968
01:37:17,231 --> 01:37:22,362
You must sign these documents, if l have
to escape from this case.

969
01:37:22,903 --> 01:37:26,703
For how many days can l be in the
hospital with my wife & concubine?

970
01:37:27,408 --> 01:37:29,876
lf l say that my health is not good,
no one is believing me.

971
01:37:30,744 --> 01:37:33,042
lf l become the Managing Director
of your company..

972
01:37:34,081 --> 01:37:36,379
l must answer all the charges
against you.

973
01:37:37,685 --> 01:37:38,879
You'll come out of jail.

974
01:37:39,753 --> 01:37:41,220
But, Police will arrest me only.

975
01:37:41,422 --> 01:37:43,049
lf l'm sentenced for 3 years
in this case..

976
01:37:43,257 --> 01:37:46,226
...l can't contest this elections.
l made you Dean..

977
01:37:46,760 --> 01:37:48,557
lf l win & become the minister,
you'll be the Health Secretary.

978
01:37:48,762 --> 01:37:49,228
Sign it.

979
01:37:50,931 --> 01:37:52,228
lf l don't contest this elections...

980
01:37:52,600 --> 01:37:55,899
...All the pending cases will be foisted on me
and l'll be jailed.

981
01:37:56,103 --> 01:37:57,229
Please, don't put me trouble.

982
01:37:58,105 --> 01:37:59,572
l'll definitely win the elections
and become the minister.

983
01:37:59,940 --> 01:38:02,408
lt's my responsibility to bring you
out & absolve you from all cases.

984
01:38:03,110 --> 01:38:03,906
Please leave me.

985
01:38:05,946 --> 01:38:06,742
Leave me.

986
01:38:07,948 --> 01:38:09,245
Malar, why is he doing like this?

987
01:38:09,450 --> 01:38:10,747
You were an ordinary Doctor..

988
01:38:10,951 --> 01:38:12,248
But my husband made you a Dean, isn't it?

989
01:38:12,620 --> 01:38:13,245
Sign it.

990
01:38:13,787 --> 01:38:14,412
You must be...

991
01:38:15,623 --> 01:38:16,248
Save me...

992
01:38:23,297 --> 01:38:24,594
Hey, it's enough...enough.

993
01:38:25,132 --> 01:38:25,598
Remove it.

994
01:38:25,799 --> 01:38:27,426
Don't kill me, l'll sign it.

995
01:38:28,469 --> 01:38:29,936
You unnecessarily tensed me up.

996
01:38:32,306 --> 01:38:32,772
Sign it.

997
01:38:33,807 --> 01:38:35,104
My blood pressure has raised
because of you.

998
01:38:37,144 --> 01:38:41,274
Hey, give him first aid and
drop him in our car. Go.

999
01:38:48,822 --> 01:38:49,618
Who are they?

1000
01:38:50,157 --> 01:38:52,955
They're touring all over lndia
for world peace.

1001
01:38:53,327 --> 01:38:54,453
They've come to our city today.

1002
01:38:54,828 --> 01:38:56,955
lf they travel through mountains,
will they get peace?

1003
01:39:22,690 --> 01:39:25,488
Hit me...Hit me...

1004
01:39:26,694 --> 01:39:29,162
l'm telling you to hit me, isn't it?
Hit me...Hit me....

1005
01:39:30,698 --> 01:39:31,995
We're unable to tolerate this.

1006
01:39:32,199 --> 01:39:32,995
Don't cry.

1007
01:39:33,867 --> 01:39:36,165
Kavitha told that Samurai's don't cry.

1008
01:39:37,204 --> 01:39:38,671
Hit me..Hit me.

1009
01:39:39,206 --> 01:39:44,007
Every blow l bear is to
strengthen my will.

1010
01:39:44,211 --> 01:39:48,011
Hit me....Hit me....

1011
01:40:03,731 --> 01:40:05,028
lt's very painful.

1012
01:40:05,566 --> 01:40:08,865
No good work can be done if
we bother about pain.

1013
01:40:09,903 --> 01:40:13,031
No good work can be done
if we bother about pain.

1014
01:40:24,251 --> 01:40:26,879
Buddy, they're beating the drums
from morning, who's dead?

1015
01:40:27,087 --> 01:40:28,884
Not dead. lt's our leader's birthday.

1016
01:40:31,091 --> 01:40:32,718
Buddy..
-Happy birthday, buddy.

1017
01:40:34,928 --> 01:40:36,555
l'll pick you up after the film.

1018
01:40:50,110 --> 01:40:53,910
Keep quiet.

1019
01:41:01,288 --> 01:41:03,415
Even, she could've bunked
classes like others, isn't it?

1020
01:41:03,624 --> 01:41:05,592
But, she has come here & asking me
to take the class.

1021
01:41:37,658 --> 01:41:38,955
l'm watching you for the
past 4 years.

1022
01:41:39,827 --> 01:41:41,294
You're going on a separate path.

1023
01:41:42,496 --> 01:41:43,963
You're not coming with us anywhere.

1024
01:41:45,666 --> 01:41:46,963
Are you the only one who
has come to study?

1025
01:41:47,334 --> 01:41:49,302
Have we all come to work as labourers?

1026
01:41:50,170 --> 01:41:50,966
Don't laugh.

1027
01:41:51,171 --> 01:41:56,973
Look, you'll get lost if you
go separately.

1028
01:41:58,178 --> 01:41:59,975
Leave it, buddy. You always keep
talking about her.

1029
01:42:02,015 --> 01:42:02,310
Give me a cigarette.

1030
01:42:02,516 --> 01:42:06,145
Hey, you should go & ask her.
-l'll smash you.

1031
01:42:08,355 --> 01:42:10,983
Kavitha, don't you know about
his character?

1032
01:42:11,525 --> 01:42:12,651
lt was his birthday yesterday.

1033
01:42:12,860 --> 01:42:15,488
He took us to a movie to celebrate it.

1034
01:42:16,029 --> 01:42:17,997
Why didn't you come for that also?

1035
01:42:18,532 --> 01:42:19,999
That's why, he is angry.

1036
01:42:20,868 --> 01:42:24,998
''Birthday wishes to Thyagu''
from Kavitha.

1037
01:42:32,045 --> 01:42:34,673
You're nearly fulfledged Doctors.

1038
01:42:35,048 --> 01:42:36,845
Life is a wonderful thing.

1039
01:42:38,552 --> 01:42:39,348
ln this world...

1040
01:42:39,553 --> 01:42:42,522
Rich & Poor, Friends & Enemies are...

1041
01:42:42,723 --> 01:42:46,181
Two things that don't differentiate
between...Life & Disease.

1042
01:42:47,060 --> 01:42:52,191
Don't consider saving life & curing
diseases as your duty.

1043
01:42:52,432 --> 01:42:53,956
Consider them as divine service.

1044
01:42:54,234 --> 01:42:56,532
Now, Medical Technology is
growing very fast.

1045
01:42:57,070 --> 01:43:00,039
At the same time, new diseases
are also emerging.

1046
01:43:00,908 --> 01:43:04,708
So, you must be always alert
and upgrade your knowledge.

1047
01:43:12,586 --> 01:43:13,712
She fell into the well.

1048
01:43:50,123 --> 01:43:53,251
Don't wait for the formalities
take immediate action like this.

1049
01:43:55,128 --> 01:43:56,425
Everyone is brilliant in this batch.

1050
01:44:03,303 --> 01:44:04,930
Today is 'Child Labour Day'.

1051
01:44:05,138 --> 01:44:07,436
Children are labouring at the age
when they should study.

1052
01:44:07,641 --> 01:44:08,938
Whatever is possible by you...

1053
01:44:10,811 --> 01:44:11,607
Lord Muruga.

1054
01:44:12,813 --> 01:44:14,280
Hey, walk properly.

1055
01:44:14,481 --> 01:44:16,278
Buddy, why is he getting angry
like a Railway Minister?

1056
01:44:17,985 --> 01:44:23,287
Lord Muruga, atleast today my business
should do well without any problem.

1057
01:44:30,998 --> 01:44:34,297
He is drunk. But he is very rich.
Don't leave him.

1058
01:44:35,836 --> 01:44:37,804
Sir, don't turn my business
upside down.

1059
01:44:38,171 --> 01:44:39,138
What's your name?

1060
01:44:39,339 --> 01:44:39,964
Your name?

1061
01:44:41,174 --> 01:44:42,141
Oh! ls it brainless?

1062
01:44:47,347 --> 01:44:48,314
Keep the magnifying glass down.

1063
01:44:48,515 --> 01:44:50,312
Why're you having 'Bhoodhakannadi'?
(Magnify glass, Ghost glass)

1064
01:44:50,684 --> 01:44:52,311
The glass is here.
Where is the ghost?

1065
01:44:52,686 --> 01:44:53,983
Don't play the fool.

1066
01:44:56,356 --> 01:44:57,823
Who is this?-M.G.R.

1067
01:44:58,025 --> 01:45:00,823
Who's this?-lt's me.
-Really!

1068
01:45:01,528 --> 01:45:02,324
Who's this?-M.G.R.

1069
01:45:02,529 --> 01:45:03,496
Who's this?-Me.

1070
01:45:03,697 --> 01:45:04,664
Who's this?-M.G.R.

1071
01:45:04,865 --> 01:45:05,331
Who's this?-lt's me.

1072
01:45:05,532 --> 01:45:06,328
Who's this?-M.G.R.

1073
01:45:06,700 --> 01:45:08,668
lt's me, M.G.R

1074
01:45:08,869 --> 01:45:09,665
Are you M.G.R.?

1075
01:45:13,540 --> 01:45:15,667
Are you cheating the people
with your computer graphics?

1076
01:45:16,043 --> 01:45:17,670
What shall we do with him?

1077
01:45:19,379 --> 01:45:20,505
We'll cut his head & paste it.

1078
01:45:21,548 --> 01:45:25,507
Now, l know everything.
You're only the arrow.

1079
01:45:26,053 --> 01:45:27,520
l know who shot you.

1080
01:45:27,888 --> 01:45:30,186
l understood when he pasted
Clinton's photo.

1081
01:45:30,557 --> 01:45:31,854
He has spoiled my daily earnings.

1082
01:45:32,559 --> 01:45:34,857
Look, they're fighting?

1083
01:45:35,062 --> 01:45:35,858
Catch him.

1084
01:45:38,398 --> 01:45:40,195
l'll collect money from my friends.

1085
01:45:43,236 --> 01:45:45,204
The country needs this very much.

1086
01:45:47,741 --> 01:45:49,208
ls she behaving like a
Medical College student?

1087
01:45:49,743 --> 01:45:51,870
Does she have to do that?-Yes.

1088
01:45:52,245 --> 01:45:52,870
What ''Yes''?

1089
01:45:54,247 --> 01:45:55,544
Why did you give charity?

1090
01:45:57,918 --> 01:45:58,714
lf you were really concerned..

1091
01:45:58,919 --> 01:46:00,716
You should've given charity
when that girl asked for it.

1092
01:46:01,254 --> 01:46:03,381
Or, is it because you consider
Kavitha as your friend?

1093
01:46:03,924 --> 01:46:06,552
Or you should've told her that you
won't give charity for this?

1094
01:46:07,260 --> 01:46:08,887
Forget it, buddy. Give me a cigarette.

1095
01:46:10,597 --> 01:46:12,064
Are you my friend only for this
cigarette or,

1096
01:46:12,265 --> 01:46:13,732
Are you asking cigarette to be
my friend?

1097
01:46:14,935 --> 01:46:19,395
Buddy, if l ever asked you for
a cigarette. Hit me with slippers.

1098
01:46:19,606 --> 01:46:20,402
l'll....

1099
01:46:22,776 --> 01:46:23,572
You dog...

1100
01:47:59,039 --> 01:48:00,336
Will you touch again?
-Don't hurt me.

1101
01:48:00,540 --> 01:48:00,835
Will you touch again?

1102
01:48:01,875 --> 01:48:03,342
Will you touch again?
-Don't do anything.

1103
01:48:03,543 --> 01:48:06,512
Will you touch again? -Please forgive me
l won't touch anyone.

1104
01:48:06,713 --> 01:48:08,340
Oh God! The train is coming.

1105
01:48:08,548 --> 01:48:09,845
lf l see you here again.

1106
01:48:10,317 --> 01:48:12,114
l'll chop you to pieces on
the track itself, you dog.

1107
01:48:16,056 --> 01:48:18,684
lf you had kept to yourself, will
such dogs dare to touch you?

1108
01:48:19,392 --> 01:48:20,689
Mind your business.

1109
01:48:21,561 --> 01:48:22,858
ls asking charity your job?

1110
01:48:33,740 --> 01:48:35,037
You got into trouble
because of me, isn't it?

1111
01:48:35,242 --> 01:48:37,369
No good work can be done
if we feel the pain.

1112
01:48:38,478 --> 01:48:40,070
Since your medicines
sub-standed,

1113
01:48:40,247 --> 01:48:42,215
Government has stopped
approving them.

1114
01:48:42,415 --> 01:48:44,042
How can you expect me to buy them?

1115
01:48:44,584 --> 01:48:46,882
Don't put me in trouble.
Take them back.

1116
01:48:47,087 --> 01:48:49,555
Why're you getting tensed?
Our brother will call you.

1117
01:48:51,758 --> 01:48:53,885
Don't cry.

1118
01:48:58,598 --> 01:48:59,724
lt's alright. Have it...

1119
01:49:02,435 --> 01:49:04,403

01:49:04,938 --> 01:49:06,235
Greetings Sir.-Greetings.

1121
01:49:06,606 --> 01:49:07,573
Have my boys come there?

1122
01:49:07,941 --> 01:49:10,239
2 people have come from
Raj Pharma company.

1123
01:49:10,610 --> 01:49:12,578
l'm the main partner of that company.

1124
01:49:13,780 --> 01:49:16,248
Wherever they want your
signature, sign it.

1125
01:49:16,616 --> 01:49:22,577
Your company doesn't have
drug control license & certificate.

1126
01:49:22,956 --> 01:49:24,583
Why did l made you as the
Dean of Medical college?

1127
01:49:24,791 --> 01:49:25,758
ls it to question me?

1128
01:49:25,959 --> 01:49:27,756
No sir, there shouldn't
be any problem...

1129
01:49:28,128 --> 01:49:28,924
Do what l say.

1130
01:49:31,131 --> 01:49:32,758
Sir, sign it with green lnk.

1131
01:49:34,301 --> 01:49:35,768
We must be very particular in
casting bogus votes.

1132
01:49:36,636 --> 01:49:38,103
This is the problem, isn't it?

1133
01:49:38,638 --> 01:49:40,765
Affix the seal here. lt's alright.
Affix the seal.

1134
01:49:50,150 --> 01:49:50,775
What's it brother?

1135
01:49:50,984 --> 01:49:55,114
We're unloading. Okay.

1136
01:49:55,322 --> 01:49:56,949
Sir, please tell him &
arrange for my promotion.

1137
01:49:59,326 --> 01:50:00,793
Which standard are you studying?

1138
01:50:01,494 --> 01:50:02,620
Do you know Rhymes?

1139
01:50:03,163 --> 01:50:03,788
Tell me.

1140
01:50:07,500 --> 01:50:08,296
Continue...continue...

1141
01:50:11,004 --> 01:50:14,303
lt's paining. -Really!
You must get cured, isn't it?

1142
01:50:15,508 --> 01:50:16,133
Come, dear.

1143
01:50:20,347 --> 01:50:21,143
Which class are you studying?

1144
01:50:21,514 --> 01:50:21,980
l'm not studying.

1145
01:50:22,515 --> 01:50:23,641
Then, what are you doing?

1146
01:50:23,850 --> 01:50:25,317
l'm working in a mechanic shed.

1147
01:50:26,686 --> 01:50:27,653
How did you get injured?

1148
01:50:27,854 --> 01:50:30,152
The owner asked me to get spanner.

1149
01:50:30,357 --> 01:50:33,656
He kicked me when l was
searching for it.

1150
01:50:34,027 --> 01:50:37,326
l fell on the bike &
the silencer scalded.

1151
01:50:40,033 --> 01:50:43,002
Owner has given me only one day off.
l must go to work.

1152
01:50:43,370 --> 01:50:44,166
When'll you discharge me?

1153
01:50:45,038 --> 01:50:46,665
You can go when your
wounds get healed.

1154
01:50:50,543 --> 01:50:51,669
Give him Dextrose.

1155
01:50:53,880 --> 01:50:55,677
Do dressing in the morning
& evening. -Okay.

1156
01:51:00,053 --> 01:51:02,021
What's your husband doing?
-She can't talk.

1157
01:51:02,889 --> 01:51:09,192
One day my father drank &
stamped on her throat. Nerve got cut.

1158
01:51:09,396 --> 01:51:11,193
She can't speak from that day.

1159
01:51:13,400 --> 01:51:15,698
Forget it. My owner will cut
my salary.

1160
01:51:15,902 --> 01:51:17,199
When'll you discharge me?

1161
01:51:19,906 --> 01:51:21,032
Turn that side.

1162
01:51:37,424 --> 01:51:38,049
Did you eat?

1163
01:51:38,591 --> 01:51:40,218
They didn't give me since
l had no money.

1164
01:51:40,760 --> 01:51:41,556
Why should you give money?

1165
01:51:41,761 --> 01:51:43,058
Everything is money related here.

1166
01:51:43,930 --> 01:51:45,898
What's this? What have you given me?

1167
01:51:46,099 --> 01:51:48,226
Everybody has give Rs.5,
but you have given me Rs.2.

1168
01:51:48,435 --> 01:51:49,402
l must put this in the dust bin.

1169
01:51:50,770 --> 01:51:51,236
What?

1170
01:51:51,438 --> 01:51:53,235
Why haven't you given this
patient anything to eat?

1171
01:52:00,280 --> 01:52:01,577
l'm calling you only.

1172
01:52:10,790 --> 01:52:14,749
Am l taking the whole lot?
Shouldn't l've to give share to others.

1173
01:52:15,128 --> 01:52:18,256
Mind your business only.

1174
01:52:22,802 --> 01:52:25,430
lt's okay, leave that. Get up.

1175
01:52:30,643 --> 01:52:32,941
Milk given here is not good.

1176
01:52:33,146 --> 01:52:35,944
Doctor has told to give
Horlicks & Complan, isn't it?

1177
01:52:36,483 --> 01:52:38,781
Ask father to buy me Horlicks.

1178
01:52:40,153 --> 01:52:41,279
Oh! Leave it.

1179
01:52:42,322 --> 01:52:43,619

Eat.-No thanks, you eat.

Take this. Give this to eat.

1182
01:52:47,994 --> 01:52:49,120
He shouldn't have empty stomach.

1183
01:52:49,829 --> 01:52:50,796
Sister...

1184
01:52:51,664 --> 01:52:53,131
What's it?-What's your name?

1185
01:52:54,834 --> 01:52:55,960
Thank you very much.

1186
01:53:00,006 --> 01:53:02,474
Smile. You can go home very soon.

1187
01:53:07,013 --> 01:53:09,311
Buddy, look at that parrot there.

1188
01:53:10,183 --> 01:53:10,979
Make fun of him.

1189
01:53:15,188 --> 01:53:15,984
l'm not feeling well.

1190
01:53:16,189 --> 01:53:19,488
l'm not feeling well, sir.
-Come here.

1191
01:53:20,360 --> 01:53:22,487
They're not allowing me to
take the tablet.

1192
01:53:23,029 --> 01:53:24,826
These boys are a big trouble.

1193
01:53:25,532 --> 01:53:27,659
What? Not feeling well.
-Who? You or parrot?

1194
01:53:27,867 --> 01:53:28,333
Me!

1195
01:53:28,535 --> 01:53:29,331
Then, why did you bring the parrot?

1196
01:53:29,702 --> 01:53:32,000
You spoiled my livelihood
that day also.

1197
01:53:32,205 --> 01:53:33,502
Just like this, you had come to
the station also, that day.

1198
01:53:33,706 --> 01:53:34,502
Were you also not there?

1199
01:53:34,874 --> 01:53:37,672
Why do you come wherever l go?

1200
01:53:38,378 --> 01:53:39,174
Are you coming to the place where l go?

1201
01:53:39,379 --> 01:53:40,505
Or else, am l coming to the place where
you go?

1202
01:53:42,048 --> 01:53:43,845
Bloody! Allow me to earn
my livelihood.

1203
01:53:45,385 --> 01:53:46,909
Hey! lt's time to go to ward.
Come, let's go.

1204
01:54:13,213 --> 01:54:13,838
Greetings Madam.

1205
01:54:16,716 --> 01:54:18,684
Where's Rajendran?

1206
01:54:18,885 --> 01:54:19,351
Gone

1207
01:54:20,053 --> 01:54:20,849
Discharged?

1208
01:54:21,387 --> 01:54:22,183
Dead.

1209
01:54:22,388 --> 01:54:23,355
Body has gone to mortuary.

1210
01:56:10,496 --> 01:56:11,793
Where's Rajendran case report?

1211
01:56:12,165 --> 01:56:12,961
lt's here, Madam.

1212
01:56:21,174 --> 01:56:22,971
How?-l don't know.

1213
01:57:08,221 --> 01:57:13,022
Doctor, Rajendran, a 12 year old
patient...died...

1214
01:57:13,226 --> 01:57:16,024
Look at the reason in the report,
for his death?

1215
01:57:16,396 --> 01:57:17,192
Look.

1216
01:57:19,232 --> 01:57:20,199
lt's written as sudden fits.

1217
01:57:20,566 --> 01:57:25,697
No, Doctor. There's no chance for
him to get fits.

1218
01:57:26,406 --> 01:57:27,532
He was a healthy boy.

1219
01:57:28,074 --> 01:57:30,201
Last night he was given dextrose.

1220
01:57:31,411 --> 01:57:34,380
The problem was in that only.

1221
01:57:34,914 --> 01:57:38,714
Look at this, how contaminated it is.

1222
01:57:39,752 --> 01:57:42,721
He got fits due to
contaminated dextrose.

1223
01:57:43,756 --> 01:57:46,554
Mano, call immediately someone
from her batch. -Yes sir.

1224
01:57:46,759 --> 01:57:48,727
Death in a hospital is a
natural thing.

1225
01:57:50,930 --> 01:57:52,056
This is not a natural death.

1226
01:57:54,934 --> 01:57:58,062
We've taken a life by injecting
poison in the name of Medicine.

1227
01:57:59,272 --> 01:58:00,899
He has died because of this only.

1228
01:58:01,941 --> 01:58:03,909
l've seen his body.

1229
01:58:04,444 --> 01:58:05,741
lt has turned blue.

1230
01:58:07,280 --> 01:58:12,582
We mustn't leave it.
We mustn't spare the supplier.

1231
01:58:18,958 --> 01:58:19,925
Only one inquiry will reveal the truth.

1232
01:58:20,126 --> 01:58:20,922
You're going on accusing.

1233
01:58:25,965 --> 01:58:27,091
Never heard of it.

1234
01:58:27,800 --> 01:58:30,598
We've never brought any item for
our hospital from this place.

1235
01:58:31,804 --> 01:58:34,602
Patient's relatives may've brought
this from elsewhere.

1236
01:58:34,974 --> 01:58:35,770
Are we responsible for it?

1237
01:58:36,976 --> 01:58:39,103
l'll enquire from the duty officer
as to what happened?

1238
01:58:39,312 --> 01:58:40,609
l'll ask him to submit
the enquiry report.

1239
01:58:41,481 --> 01:58:45,941
Just now, you had accused that this
hospital is responsible for all this.

1240
01:58:46,319 --> 01:58:47,786
Don't say like that outside.

1241
01:58:48,321 --> 01:58:48,946
Come in.

1242
01:58:50,656 --> 01:58:53,284
Your friend has faced a death
for the first time, isn't it?

1243
01:58:53,493 --> 01:58:55,290
lt's not a death. lt's a murder.

1244
01:58:56,162 --> 01:58:57,459
l told you that l'll make
an enquiry.

1245
01:58:58,331 --> 01:59:01,630
They're charging me of corruption.
Can they prove it?

1246
01:59:02,502 --> 01:59:04,129
Ask...
-Sir, a phone call for you.

1247
01:59:04,670 --> 01:59:05,967
l'm lnbaraj speaking.
What's the matter?

1248
01:59:06,172 --> 01:59:09,630
A few patients died after administering
medicines supplied by you.-Really?!

1249
01:59:10,009 --> 01:59:11,306
Save my ass, sir.

1250
01:59:11,511 --> 01:59:12,136
You do one thing.

1251
01:59:12,845 --> 01:59:15,643
First clear & dispose all
our company's products.

1252
01:59:15,848 --> 01:59:17,315
l'll send my men. -Okay sir.

1253
01:59:20,853 --> 01:59:21,979
What were we discussing?
-Corruption sir.

1254
01:59:22,188 --> 01:59:24,486
Oh! Yes, corruption.
-Corruption is there.

1255
01:59:25,191 --> 01:59:25,816
l'm asking you...

1256
01:59:30,363 --> 01:59:31,830
Jayakumar, look.

1257
01:59:32,698 --> 01:59:36,828
Dean said that they'll never buy any
product from Raj Pharma.

1258
01:59:37,203 --> 01:59:40,331
Then, what's all this?

1259
01:59:41,541 --> 01:59:43,839
Then, Dean is also
involved in this.

1260
01:59:44,377 --> 01:59:47,835
lf we're buying from Raj Pharma,

1261
01:59:48,881 --> 01:59:52,339
Then, entire batch of this supply
would be contaminated.

1262
01:59:52,718 --> 01:59:54,515
Don't know how many patients
have been given this?

1263
01:59:55,221 --> 01:59:56,188
A mistake has been committed.

1264
01:59:56,889 --> 01:59:58,516
A mistake on a large scale
has occurred.

1265
01:59:59,225 --> 02:00:01,022
Oh God!

1266
02:00:01,894 --> 02:00:06,194
First, we must go to store room
and stop the supply immediately.

1267
02:00:06,566 --> 02:00:08,193
Make it fast, load it
quickly man.

1268
02:00:10,236 --> 02:00:11,863
l'm loading it...l'll come
immediately.

1269
02:00:12,071 --> 02:00:14,539
Brother. -Don't know what & when to ask?
-Get lost man.

1270
02:00:20,913 --> 02:00:24,212
To which wards have you supplied
Saline bottles of Raj Pharma.

1271
02:00:24,750 --> 02:00:27,719
Raj Pharma? We never buy any
medicines from that company.

1272
02:00:28,087 --> 02:00:31,887
l know that. First check the stock.

1273
02:00:32,091 --> 02:00:33,558
Why're you ordering me, Madam?

1274
02:00:34,427 --> 02:00:35,052
Look at this....

1275
02:00:36,262 --> 02:00:37,559
We're buying all medicines
from here only.

1276
02:00:37,763 --> 02:00:38,559
Don't argue any further, go away.

1277
02:00:42,435 --> 02:00:43,561
Elder man! What's this, there are many
deaths today?

1278
02:00:43,769 --> 02:00:46,397
Don't know. What's happening here?

1279
02:00:46,606 --> 02:00:48,073
May be they had consumed
spurious liquor.

1280
02:00:48,274 --> 02:00:49,070
Who knows?

1281
02:00:49,275 --> 02:00:51,573
They appear to be healthy.
Don't know what's the problem.

1282
02:00:51,944 --> 02:00:52,569
Does Thyagu know about this?

1283
02:00:52,778 --> 02:00:54,575
He is in the hostel. l've sent for him.

1284
02:00:56,949 --> 02:00:57,574
l don't want anything.

1285
02:00:58,951 --> 02:01:00,919
What a treacherous plan
has been executed here.

1286
02:01:02,455 --> 02:01:05,913
That Dean who had stressed about this
profession as being a divine service,

1287
02:01:06,626 --> 02:01:09,424
ls involved in this.

1288
02:01:09,795 --> 02:01:11,922
What can we do?
We're just House Surgeons.

1289
02:01:12,131 --> 02:01:13,257
We're under Dean's control.

1290
02:01:13,466 --> 02:01:15,593
We can pass MBBS only if he
gives us a certificate.

1291
02:01:15,801 --> 02:01:18,099
lf we autogonize him,
we'll be jeoparding our future.

1292
02:01:20,473 --> 02:01:22,941
There's some truth in what
Kavitha is saying.

1293
02:01:23,142 --> 02:01:25,269
Some big mistake has been committed.
lgnoring it, we're...

1294
02:01:25,478 --> 02:01:29,437
She's blabbering in emotion.
Why're you talking like mad?

1295
02:01:29,649 --> 02:01:31,446
Why to poke nose in
unnecessary things?

1296
02:01:31,651 --> 02:01:34,119
We must concentrate on our studies only.
ls this our job?

1297
02:01:34,987 --> 02:01:36,955
An injustice has been done
in front us.

1298
02:01:37,323 --> 02:01:39,450
You all are so insensitive
towards it.

1299
02:01:40,159 --> 02:01:41,626
You all are talking about
your personal problem.

1300
02:01:43,329 --> 02:01:44,626
No Kavitha, try to understand,
what l'm saying.

1301
02:01:44,830 --> 02:01:48,288
Leave it. Don't try to convince me.
Let Thyagu come.

1302
02:01:49,835 --> 02:01:52,303
Let Thyagu come.

1303
02:02:02,515 --> 02:02:03,482
A small boy.

1304
02:02:04,517 --> 02:02:06,815
Stop crying. l know everything.

1305
02:02:07,520 --> 02:02:08,145
You know, isn't it?

1306
02:02:09,689 --> 02:02:12,317
We're treating people having faith on
the medicines of this hospital.

1307
02:02:12,525 --> 02:02:14,322
But, there is some mischief in it.

1308
02:02:14,860 --> 02:02:16,987
Right from the Dean, everyone
is committing mistakes.

1309
02:02:17,196 --> 02:02:19,664
They're not coming with me to enquire.

1310
02:02:19,865 --> 02:02:21,492
We must enquire.

1311
02:02:21,701 --> 02:02:24,329
Whom will you ask? Tell me,
whom will you ask?

1312
02:02:24,704 --> 02:02:27,332
We'll seek justice from
Secretary & Minister of Health.

1313
02:02:27,540 --> 02:02:29,667
Do you know who's the
Minister of Health?

1314
02:02:30,543 --> 02:02:33,341
The original proprietor of Raj Pharma
is this supplier of this hospital.

1315
02:02:35,381 --> 02:02:38,179
lf you start making enquiries,
it'll lead to witch hunting.

1316
02:02:38,384 --> 02:02:40,682
Then, are you also suggesting to
drop this issue here itself?

1317
02:02:41,053 --> 02:02:42,179
What else can we do?

1318
02:02:43,055 --> 02:02:46,024
Everyone knows about all
the corruption going on here.

1319
02:02:46,225 --> 02:02:48,693
They've turned a blind eye to it
and become insensitive to it.

1320
02:02:49,395 --> 02:02:53,195
Only you're trying to seek
justice & change.

1321
02:02:54,066 --> 02:02:57,524
Stop this job of changing the world.
lt'll be like this only.

1322
02:02:58,404 --> 02:03:00,372
Endure it and carry on living.

1323
02:03:01,574 --> 02:03:06,034
How can we endure all this Thyagu?

1324
02:03:07,913 --> 02:03:10,711
Blood from his wound didn't
even stop flowing.

1325
02:03:13,252 --> 02:03:18,212
Even you're not able to
understand me.

1326
02:03:19,258 --> 02:03:20,555
Understand, what l'm saying?

1327
02:03:21,260 --> 02:03:24,229
Now, you're crying. Will you be
crying all the 24 hours?

1328
02:03:24,764 --> 02:03:28,564
Look, every man can't be in the same
emotional condition all the time.

1329
02:03:30,770 --> 02:03:33,739
Think about it, you'll come
to a decision.

1330
02:04:03,836 --> 02:04:05,133
Sister, l don't have
any great wish.

1331
02:04:05,337 --> 02:04:07,464
Somehow l must make her talk.

1332
02:04:07,673 --> 02:04:09,641
l'm ready to spend any
amount for it.

1333
02:04:09,842 --> 02:04:13,141
To make her talk, l'll run a
mechanic shop & foot the bill.

1334
02:04:13,345 --> 02:04:14,642
Why don't you say something sister?

1335
02:04:15,681 --> 02:04:16,306
Okay.

1336
02:04:17,016 --> 02:04:17,641
Thanks, sister.

1337
02:04:18,184 --> 02:04:21,984
The corruption which is taking lives
is happening before us.

1338
02:04:22,521 --> 02:04:24,648
How can l turn a
blind eye to it?

1339
02:04:25,524 --> 02:04:29,654
Has everyone's heart become so
insensitive that even a death can't move it?

1340
02:04:30,696 --> 02:04:32,323
l can't be like that.

1341
02:04:33,532 --> 02:04:41,337
l'm not worried about cowards but
even a brave man like you didn't question!

1342
02:04:42,208 --> 02:04:44,176
...And tried to pacify me

1343
02:04:45,044 --> 02:04:47,012
l'm not able to bear it Thyagu.

1344
02:04:48,047 --> 02:04:51,346
Though you've bad habits
of a common man,

1345
02:04:51,717 --> 02:04:52,843
You're a good man, Thyagu.

1346
02:04:53,552 --> 02:04:57,682
A great warrior who can't even act
like a coward is called as Samurai.

1347
02:04:58,390 --> 02:04:59,357
You're one like that.

1348
02:05:00,226 --> 02:05:04,856
lf you start seeking justice,
thousands will follow you.

1349
02:05:09,401 --> 02:05:11,369
l've to climb 3 floors to
cigarette.

1350
02:05:12,905 --> 02:05:13,701
Buddy!

1351
02:05:16,909 --> 02:05:18,376
Did you get drunk last night?

1352
02:05:19,411 --> 02:05:21,538
Without coming to room,
you slept here only.

1353
02:05:22,081 --> 02:05:24,379
lt seems Kavitha didn't come
to Hostel last night.

1354
02:05:25,584 --> 02:05:26,881
Okay, l'll go, it's getting late.

1355
02:05:49,108 --> 02:05:49,904
What happened to you?

1356
02:05:55,114 --> 02:05:56,081
Are you still thinking about it?

1357
02:05:58,117 --> 02:05:59,914
What's the relationship between you
and the persons who died?

1358
02:06:06,458 --> 02:06:09,086
Thinking about person totally unconnected
to you, you had a sleepless night?

1359
02:06:09,295 --> 02:06:11,263
Why're you sitting here
like a mad girl?

1360
02:06:11,630 --> 02:06:12,927
Who's he? Your brother?

1361
02:06:15,801 --> 02:06:16,927
Without eating anything.

1362
02:06:22,641 --> 02:06:23,767
First drink this.

1363
02:06:28,981 --> 02:06:30,778
Will you seek justice only if
you're related to the victim?

1364
02:06:33,319 --> 02:06:34,445
l'll make you seek justice.

1365
02:06:52,838 --> 02:06:53,634
Please give that plate.

1366
02:06:53,839 --> 02:06:55,136
Grandma, give me 2 ''ldlis''.

1367
02:07:10,522 --> 02:07:12,149
Grandma, l'll come back & pay you.

1368
02:07:25,204 --> 02:07:29,163
Please come & save her. -Give me.

1369
02:08:00,072 --> 02:08:03,701
Shut up..shut up.
You did all this.

1370
02:08:05,244 --> 02:08:06,575
Why're you torturing me?

1371
02:08:11,917 --> 02:08:14,579
l can't bear it any more.

1372
02:08:18,590 --> 02:08:19,921
What am l going to do now?

1373
02:08:20,526 --> 02:08:21,618
Why all this is happening to me?

1374
02:08:22,061 --> 02:08:22,925
Who's Thyagu here?

1375
02:08:26,832 --> 02:08:27,764
lt's me.

1376
02:08:28,834 --> 02:08:30,131
My Kavitha...!

1377
02:09:14,113 --> 02:09:18,049
Why Kavitha?...
What am l to do now?

1378
02:09:27,192 --> 02:09:28,454
Why're you crying?

1379
02:09:29,328 --> 02:09:31,353
Why did you do like this?

1380
02:09:33,198 --> 02:09:35,723
l'm not able to bear this.

1381
02:09:36,969 --> 02:09:38,231
Who am l?

1382
02:09:39,571 --> 02:09:44,406
What is the relationship between you & me?

1383
02:09:46,411 --> 02:09:48,811
Do you've to resort to this
to make me understand.

1384
02:09:52,584 --> 02:09:54,381
You're my life.

1385
02:09:54,586 --> 02:09:58,522
You're only...!

1386
02:09:59,258 --> 02:10:05,663
Then, will you stand for justice wherever
a crime in committed?

1387
02:10:09,701 --> 02:10:12,033
You must seek justice.

1388
02:10:13,705 --> 02:10:14,831
Will you do it?

1389
02:10:18,210 --> 02:10:20,371
You mustn't cry!

1390
02:10:23,048 --> 02:10:24,015
You mustn't cry!

1391
02:10:26,385 --> 02:10:28,785
You're a Samurai.

1392
02:10:30,389 --> 02:10:33,187
You'll seek justice.

1393
02:10:34,726 --> 02:10:35,988
You'll?

1394
02:11:14,600 --> 02:11:17,000
Sudden turn in Medicine
Company's corruption case...

1395
02:11:17,269 --> 02:11:18,793
Who owns Raj Pharma?

1396
02:11:19,104 --> 02:11:22,073
Will former Health Minister lnbaraj
be released?

1397
02:11:26,612 --> 02:11:29,775
Only we are working under the Law
but look at these people.

1398
02:11:30,115 --> 02:11:30,911
Missing.

1399
02:11:36,121 --> 02:11:37,088
Look at this advertisement.

1400
02:11:37,789 --> 02:11:40,087
Neither there's a photo nor
there are clear details.

1401
02:11:40,626 --> 02:11:42,594
Next week in our lives
after the operation.

1402
02:11:42,794 --> 02:11:46,252
With Govt.'s help you definitely
promised to meet at the Hospital.

1403
02:11:47,132 --> 02:11:49,600
l read the sentence leaving
words defaced by coffee.

1404
02:11:49,801 --> 02:11:50,426
Listen.

1405
02:11:50,636 --> 02:11:54,094
Next operation at Govt.Hospital.

1406
02:11:54,973 --> 02:11:58,636
We'll meet definitely.
Come without fail.

1407
02:11:59,144 --> 02:12:01,169
lf we read leaving a word
we get a clear meaning.

1408
02:12:01,480 --> 02:12:01,946
lsn't it?

1409
02:12:04,316 --> 02:12:05,180
Aged 51 years.

1410
02:12:07,152 --> 02:12:10,280
...lnbaraj.
'lnbam'....Santhosam(Happiness).

1411
02:12:14,159 --> 02:12:16,127
...lnbaraj, he's also 51 years old.

1412
02:12:16,328 --> 02:12:17,852
...5 feet 9 inches.....wheatish complexion.

1413
02:12:20,999 --> 02:12:22,626
This is the method of communication
of the kidnappers.

1414
02:12:39,685 --> 02:12:41,152
Where are you sleeping? Get up.

1415
02:12:52,364 --> 02:12:54,832
ln the name of Holy Christ...

1416
02:12:55,033 --> 02:12:55,556
What's your name?

1417
02:12:56,702 --> 02:12:58,329
Age? -45 years.

1418
02:12:58,537 --> 02:12:59,162
What's your problem?

1419
02:12:59,371 --> 02:13:02,772
lt seems you're making plenty of money
with a new CT scanner in your clinic.

1420
02:13:07,713 --> 02:13:09,442
Brother, where shall we put
this body?

1421
02:13:09,881 --> 02:13:12,679
Why're you torturing me for a
corpse not worth a penny?

1422
02:13:12,884 --> 02:13:13,680
Put it somewhere inside.

1423
02:13:15,387 --> 02:13:17,787
lt's paining....
Doctor, it's paining.

1424
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:28,796
l'm lnspector Selvamani speaking.

1425
02:13:28,900 --> 02:13:29,696
What are you doing there?

1426
02:13:30,402 --> 02:13:32,029
l've been calling you for a long time.
Can't you attend the call?

1427
02:13:32,237 --> 02:13:33,465
Sir, l was on rounds.

1428
02:13:33,905 --> 02:13:35,702
No one should get suspicious
when l talk.

1429
02:13:35,907 --> 02:13:37,033
So, l've come to a secluded
place to talk to you.

1430
02:13:37,409 --> 02:13:39,274
Okay! Now what's the position there?

1431
02:13:40,912 --> 02:13:43,039
Nothing suspicious till now!

1432
02:13:43,415 --> 02:13:49,285
Our people are keeping vigil all over
the hospital, as Doctors & ward boys.

1433
02:13:49,755 --> 02:13:52,223
We're following all your
instructions to the letter.

1434
02:13:52,424 --> 02:13:54,722
l've given instructions to all
the Hospital staff.

1435
02:13:54,926 --> 02:13:59,386
ln room No:312 of lnbaraj, all our
people are waiting fully prepared.

1436
02:13:59,765 --> 02:14:03,394
We'll catch anyone entering
in any disguise.

1437
02:14:12,778 --> 02:14:15,576
Be alert like this. l'll call you
every 5 minutes.

1438
02:14:37,969 --> 02:14:40,460
Hey! This phone is not working.
Change the batteries. -Yes, sir.

1439
02:14:40,806 --> 02:14:42,535
Why're you torturing me like this?

1440
02:14:43,141 --> 02:14:45,006
l'll get out of this case.

1441
02:14:45,477 --> 02:14:48,344
All this hospital drama
is for a day or two.

1442
02:14:48,647 --> 02:14:52,879
You're shifting my room
and torturing me.

1443
02:14:53,318 --> 02:14:54,114
Give your phone.

1444
02:14:56,488 --> 02:14:57,614
All this is for your
security only.

1445
02:14:57,823 --> 02:14:58,790
Bloody security.

1446
02:14:59,491 --> 02:15:00,958
Don't we know about your
security.

1447
02:15:01,827 --> 02:15:03,818
When a person blasts himself
with a belt bomb.

1448
02:15:04,162 --> 02:15:06,687
lmmediately, you'll start checking
only the stomachs.

1449
02:15:07,165 --> 02:15:09,292
lf another comes with a bomb tied
to his leg, you'll leave him.

1450
02:15:09,835 --> 02:15:14,238
After the murder... You'll protect
the murder spot heavily.

1451
02:15:14,506 --> 02:15:18,636
Look, l know about my security.
You worry about your job.

1452
02:15:18,844 --> 02:15:20,175
My calculations never go wrong.

1453
02:15:20,846 --> 02:15:22,040
Today, l'll catch them.

1454
02:15:41,199 --> 02:15:44,396
Hey, you go that side & watch.
...l'll go this side.

1455
02:15:46,538 --> 02:15:47,664
Didn't you get a wheel chair?

1456
02:15:48,039 --> 02:15:49,734
Doctor had advised to walk...
-ls it?

1457
02:15:50,208 --> 02:15:50,731
Be careful!

1458
02:15:51,877 --> 02:15:52,536
Please! - Not able to.

1459
02:16:16,568 --> 02:16:18,536
Oh God! l must stop the gang
from entering here.

1460
02:16:29,581 --> 02:16:31,048
Yes...yes...lt's confirmed on 3rd.

1461
02:16:34,586 --> 02:16:37,214
Tell me, why're you here?

1462
02:16:37,923 --> 02:16:38,787
How many people have come here?

1463
02:17:06,284 --> 02:17:06,750
Tell me.

1464
02:17:10,121 --> 02:17:11,145
You came to do something
with the AC.

1465
02:17:11,957 --> 02:17:12,582
What's that?

1466
02:17:13,792 --> 02:17:14,258
Come on speak up.

1467
02:17:19,297 --> 02:17:22,596
Take this...do it..
do it man.

1468
02:17:37,649 --> 02:17:38,274
Check what's it?

1469
02:18:43,381 --> 02:18:44,848
Police have hidden lnbaraj and laid
a trap for us. You go away.

1470
02:18:45,050 --> 02:18:46,711
Then, you?
-l'll escape somehow.

1471
02:18:47,052 --> 02:18:49,680
l'll say we'll link Ganges & Kaveri
that's all, isn't it.

1472
02:19:29,094 --> 02:19:32,222
l'm calling from DlG's Office.
ls Ex-Minister lnbaraj there?

1473
02:19:43,942 --> 02:19:44,738
What were you doing there?

1474
02:19:45,610 --> 02:19:46,975
How could they enter such a
heavy security cordon?

1475
02:19:48,947 --> 02:19:51,415
Close the hospital. -Not a single patient
should come in or go out.t.

1476
02:19:51,616 --> 02:19:52,412
Check everyone.

1477
02:19:54,953 --> 02:19:57,183
Okay, we'll round up everyone.
...ASP is on the way.

1478
02:20:23,648 --> 02:20:25,275
Thyagu is signaling something.
See, what's it?

1479
02:20:39,497 --> 02:20:40,964
lt seems we must reach in
5 minutes. Go.

1480
02:20:41,166 --> 02:20:42,030
Close the gate.

1481
02:20:43,334 --> 02:20:45,029
Look up there! There's some one
there...go quickly.

1482
02:21:00,018 --> 02:21:01,986
When l was talking to you from
mortuary, someone attacked me.

1483
02:21:02,187 --> 02:21:03,245
Don't give me silly reasons.

1484
02:21:03,855 --> 02:21:05,186
Change the department and
join elsewhere.

1485
02:21:17,535 --> 02:21:18,593
We've planted a bomb in
your hospital.

1486
02:21:19,537 --> 02:21:22,005
lt'll go off in another 5 minutes.
lf possible, save lives.

1487
02:21:42,393 --> 02:21:43,621
This may be Thyagu's plan.

1488
02:21:43,895 --> 02:21:46,022
To facilitate us to do our job easily
he would've done something.

1489
02:21:46,231 --> 02:21:46,697
Come, fast.

1490
02:22:19,430 --> 02:22:20,829
Show your slip. Take it.

1491
02:22:21,266 --> 02:22:23,461
Go to room no:8.
-Where's it?

1492
02:22:23,601 --> 02:22:25,398
lt's opposite only.Look.
-Okay.

1493
02:22:25,937 --> 02:22:28,235
Sir, l've been standing since
a long time, my legs are paining.

1494
02:22:28,439 --> 02:22:29,997
Wait, let the patient come out.

1495
02:22:30,275 --> 02:22:31,264
Hey, leg pain! You go in.

1496
02:22:33,611 --> 02:22:34,077
What happened?

1497
02:22:34,445 --> 02:22:37,243
A small accident. That's why...
l came to consult a Doctor.

1498
02:22:37,448 --> 02:22:37,743
Okay.

1499
02:22:46,124 --> 02:22:47,614
Have they kidnapped lnbaraj
from Sooriya Hospital?

1500
02:23:14,319 --> 02:23:15,183
Come in Varadan.
What do you want?

1501
02:23:15,987 --> 02:23:17,113
Thyagu has hurt his leg.

1502
02:23:17,322 --> 02:23:19,790
Oh God! -Give me tincture
or any ointment if you have.

1503
02:23:19,991 --> 02:23:21,788
We don't have English Medicine.

1504
02:23:22,327 --> 02:23:24,522
Wait, my mother-in-law might be
having some medicine.

1505
02:23:24,662 --> 02:23:26,857
She knows about country medicines.
l'll send her.

1506
02:23:27,332 --> 02:23:27,798
Okay.

1507
02:23:34,172 --> 02:23:36,640
What sort of treatment they
give in Hospitals?

1508
02:23:37,175 --> 02:23:38,870
They'll forget a scissors inside
and stitch it.

1509
02:23:39,344 --> 02:23:41,141
lf we enter the hospital in one piece,
they'll send us handicapped.

1510
02:23:41,346 --> 02:23:41,812
Look!

1511
02:23:42,013 --> 02:23:44,311
Even for this wound they've
medicated it superficially.

1512
02:23:45,350 --> 02:23:47,409
How did you get hurt so severely?

1513
02:23:47,685 --> 02:23:50,654
How could that slippery mount know that
he's a great Nature Lover?

1514
02:23:50,855 --> 02:23:53,483
He got into the mount to take
photographs. He slipped & fell.

1515
02:23:53,691 --> 02:23:54,658
...And broke his leg.

1516
02:23:59,530 --> 02:24:02,761
Who plucked the wild flower?
Who removed the stalks?

1517
02:24:02,867 --> 02:24:06,098
lf l given medicine, even a corpse
will come to life again.

1518
02:24:06,871 --> 02:24:09,499
You're the one who stays
with him, isn't it. -Yes.

1519
02:24:09,707 --> 02:24:12,505
At midnight you must
medicate him like this again.

1520
02:24:12,710 --> 02:24:13,176
Okay.

1521
02:24:13,378 --> 02:24:18,509
The medicine will dry off.Peel it off
and put the way l'm putting it.

1522
02:24:18,716 --> 02:24:19,182
Understood?

1523
02:25:24,782 --> 02:25:28,513
One who tied the Sun of the Sky
in her single plait.

1524
02:25:28,786 --> 02:25:33,458
One who stuck stars in
her head jewellery.

1525
02:25:45,636 --> 02:25:49,936
l'm the one who applied
volcanic Lava as henna.

1526
02:25:50,041 --> 02:25:55,138
l'm a twig which has
entangled your body.

1527
02:25:55,646 --> 02:25:57,614
l don't know what l desire.

1528
02:25:57,982 --> 02:26:03,443
l'm a parrot who will eat you
in small bits.

1529
02:26:03,821 --> 02:26:06,289
ls it my desire to fondle you?

1530
02:26:23,007 --> 02:26:26,807
You're the one who tied the
Sun with your single plait.

1531
02:26:27,011 --> 02:26:31,141
You're the one who stuck shining
stars in your head band.

1532
02:26:31,516 --> 02:26:35,316
You're the one who applied
volcanic Lava as henna.

1533
02:26:35,520 --> 02:26:40,981
Oh! Twig who has entangled my body.

1534
02:26:41,526 --> 02:26:43,494
l don't know what's your desire.

1535
02:26:43,694 --> 02:26:49,496
Dear! You're the parrot who
eats me in small bits.

1536
02:26:49,700 --> 02:26:51,725
Do you desire to kill me?

1537
02:27:25,369 --> 02:27:29,237
ln the Love feast,
we are the food.

1538
02:27:29,707 --> 02:27:33,666
You can find strange things here.
Food eating food here.

1539
02:27:33,878 --> 02:27:37,678
ln interpretation of Love,
earth is different.

1540
02:27:37,882 --> 02:27:39,850
ln winter it'll be hot,
ln summer, it'll be cold.

1541
02:27:40,051 --> 02:27:41,518
These strange things can be
seen here only.

1542
02:27:41,719 --> 02:27:45,678
As the warmth for your chillness
burn me often.

1543
02:27:45,890 --> 02:27:49,917
My sword will find peace by getting
drenched in your sweat.

1544
02:27:50,728 --> 02:27:54,687
One who forgot love.
One who went beyond desire.

1545
02:27:54,899 --> 02:27:58,528
One who gave up sainthood
achieved heaven immediately.

1546
02:28:56,961 --> 02:29:00,863
Why're you hiding from me?

1547
02:29:01,132 --> 02:29:04,761
Even if you go to Tora Bora Carves
l'll come after you.

1548
02:29:05,136 --> 02:29:08,936
lf l leave you, where can l go?

1549
02:29:09,140 --> 02:29:13,099
l'll hide myself in the
lines of your palm.

1550
02:29:13,311 --> 02:29:17,145
Even after falling in love!
Why're you playing hide & seek?

1551
02:29:17,481 --> 02:29:21,679
lf you find me out,
love will rule after that.

1552
02:29:22,153 --> 02:29:26,283
Plucking the sword from my hand,
you're placing the flowers.

1553
02:29:26,490 --> 02:29:29,948
l've some peace on getting
this warrant.

1554
02:31:11,462 --> 02:31:12,759
l'm a Dam Engineer.

1555
02:31:13,130 --> 02:31:15,530
But there's no one to
give me even a glass of water.

1556
02:31:15,800 --> 02:31:17,859
l've got used to it for the past
4 years...come, let's go.

1557
02:31:26,644 --> 02:31:27,906
Shall we go? Come.

1558
02:31:30,314 --> 02:31:31,144
l'll stay here only.

1559
02:31:32,483 --> 02:31:34,212
Take the keys. Shall l go?

1560
02:31:36,320 --> 02:31:37,218
Won't you ask me, why?

1561
02:31:41,325 --> 02:31:45,625
l know whatever you'll do,
it'll be for good only.

1562
02:31:46,831 --> 02:31:47,798
l'll not ask.

1563
02:31:49,333 --> 02:31:49,890
l'll not ask.

1564
02:31:51,001 --> 02:31:51,797
l'll come back soon.

1565
02:32:06,517 --> 02:32:08,576
Tissues collected from
the rope car.

1566
02:32:09,019 --> 02:32:10,987
And the tissue collected
from hospital yesterday.

1567
02:32:11,188 --> 02:32:12,155
Belong to same person.

1568
02:32:12,690 --> 02:32:14,157
Both match perfectly.

1569
02:32:14,358 --> 02:32:16,258
Can you say to which part of the
body these tissues belong to?

1570
02:32:18,696 --> 02:32:20,493
..From the knees.

1571
02:32:22,199 --> 02:32:25,498
ln the tissue given by you, there was
a strand of Jeans pant also.

1572
02:32:27,872 --> 02:32:30,500
Hey you applied medicine to the knees
of the people

1573
02:32:30,708 --> 02:32:32,676
Between the age group of 25-30
Do you remember their faces?

1574
02:32:32,877 --> 02:32:34,504
No, sir, since there will be
heavy rush.

1575
02:32:34,712 --> 02:32:36,179
l'll first see the slip
given by the Doctor,

1576
02:32:36,380 --> 02:32:37,677
Second, l'll see the wound.

1577
02:32:37,882 --> 02:32:39,179
Third, l'll apply medicine
to the wound.

1578
02:32:39,383 --> 02:32:40,850
Where are those slips?
-They're here only.

1579
02:32:45,723 --> 02:32:49,625
The hand writing here doesn't
belong to any of our hospital's Doctor.

1580
02:32:49,894 --> 02:32:52,522
But, definitely this is a
Doctor's hand writing.

1581
02:32:58,235 --> 02:33:00,362
Sir, there's no name of Thyagu
in this register.

1582
02:33:21,592 --> 02:33:24,060
Dear, our Deiva is missing.

1583
02:33:24,428 --> 02:33:24,894
Deiva?

1584
02:33:25,095 --> 02:33:28,121
l searched her everywhere.
She's missing.

1585
02:33:28,599 --> 02:33:29,327
Deiva missing?

1586
02:33:42,780 --> 02:33:44,247
What happened Deiva?

1587
02:33:44,448 --> 02:33:47,747
Where's Thyagu?

1588
02:33:50,454 --> 02:33:51,944
Thanks for all your help.

1589
02:33:53,624 --> 02:33:54,249
l'm leaving.

1590
02:34:01,298 --> 02:34:02,822
The one going there's Thyagu.
-Deiva stop.

1591
02:34:33,664 --> 02:34:35,962
Why did you come here?
-To see you.

1592
02:34:37,334 --> 02:34:40,132
You've seen me, isn't it.
Go away.

1593
02:34:40,671 --> 02:34:43,970
Why do you hate me?
Why do you always move away from me

1594
02:34:46,343 --> 02:34:47,207
Don't ask me anything.

1595
02:34:50,514 --> 02:34:51,139
First, go away from here.

1596
02:34:51,348 --> 02:34:53,873
Please don't ask me to go away.

1597
02:34:54,685 --> 02:34:56,209
l'll come with you.

1598
02:34:58,689 --> 02:34:59,155
What?

1599
02:35:00,691 --> 02:35:01,157
Love?!

1600
02:35:04,528 --> 02:35:05,426
What do you know about me?

1601
02:35:06,030 --> 02:35:07,224
l know you're a good man.

1602
02:35:08,032 --> 02:35:08,657
What else?

1603
02:35:09,033 --> 02:35:10,500
l know you're a good man.

1604
02:35:12,369 --> 02:35:14,496
What else do you know about me?

1605
02:35:14,705 --> 02:35:16,104
l know you're a good man.

1606
02:35:17,541 --> 02:35:19,236
Have you gone mad?

1607
02:35:22,046 --> 02:35:22,705
Who's this Kavitha?

1608
02:35:31,555 --> 02:35:34,183
Don't look at me like that Deiva.
Don't look at me like that.

1609
02:35:58,415 --> 02:36:01,213
Many things which l couldn't
feel when Kavitha was alive.

1610
02:36:04,755 --> 02:36:06,416
She made me understand them
by giving her life.

1611
02:36:10,094 --> 02:36:11,721
You know only one side of my face.

1612
02:36:12,763 --> 02:36:14,424
Your father is after the
other side of the face.

1613
02:36:19,770 --> 02:36:21,169
l'm like fire.

1614
02:36:22,539 --> 02:36:24,063
You're trying to come under it
mistaking it for shadow.

1615
02:36:26,710 --> 02:36:28,007
lt's impossible.

1616
02:36:39,490 --> 02:36:40,081
Father!

1617
02:36:48,132 --> 02:36:48,598
Don't move.

1618
02:37:05,549 --> 02:37:07,073
Who are you?

1619
02:37:07,518 --> 02:37:11,215
What have you done to the people whom
you've kidnapped? Tell me.

1620
02:37:11,488 --> 02:37:12,716
Did you kill them?

1621
02:37:13,891 --> 02:37:16,689
Come one...speak..speak...
Won't you speak?

1622
02:37:17,594 --> 02:37:20,563
You'll go on kidnapping people.

1623
02:37:21,565 --> 02:37:27,265
Do you want us to watch
all the fun like kids?

1624
02:37:32,009 --> 02:37:33,033
Speak man!

1625
02:37:35,078 --> 02:37:39,174
Otherwise, you'll become
dumb forever.

1626
02:37:41,151 --> 02:37:42,243
Why're you staring?

1627
02:37:53,464 --> 02:37:55,659
Now, you'll speak.

1628
02:38:11,381 --> 02:38:20,551
Did you ever interrogate anyone
for corruption like this?

1629
02:38:34,571 --> 02:38:35,595
l'm D.G.P speaking.

1630
02:38:36,240 --> 02:38:38,538
Did you interrogate him?
Did he say anything?

1631
02:38:39,009 --> 02:38:40,101
We are interrogating, sir.

1632
02:38:40,310 --> 02:38:41,800
C.B.l officers are waiting here.

1633
02:38:42,012 --> 02:38:43,240
Bring him immediately to Chennai.

1634
02:38:44,248 --> 02:38:45,545
Just now, he started telling...

1635
02:38:45,749 --> 02:38:47,580
Just follow my order man.

1636
02:38:50,254 --> 02:38:51,448
Put him into the vehicle.

1637
02:38:54,658 --> 02:38:58,219
Move...move...move.

1638
02:38:59,129 --> 02:39:00,323
What are you looking at?

1639
02:39:00,531 --> 02:39:02,055
Take the camera and
take out the roll.

1640
02:39:02,900 --> 02:39:04,561
Mask his face and get him
into the vehicle.

1641
02:39:06,603 --> 02:39:07,627
Go back.

1642
02:39:41,471 --> 02:39:46,272
Look, how happy these people are?

1643
02:39:47,578 --> 02:39:49,876
Why're you like this?

1644
02:39:53,984 --> 02:40:02,392
l'm like this because l want to see
everyone as happy as these people...

1645
02:40:11,001 --> 02:40:13,697
Father's name Nallamuthu Swamy.
Mother's name Annakameshwari.

1646
02:40:14,938 --> 02:40:17,668
Doctor, tell me, why did you
kidnap all these people?

1647
02:40:18,008 --> 02:40:19,100
What do you want?

1648
02:40:20,243 --> 02:40:21,267
l want justice.

1649
02:40:22,245 --> 02:40:23,075
l want justice.

1650
02:40:23,847 --> 02:40:27,305
For the people l had kidnapped, l want
judgement for their corruption cases.

1651
02:40:27,884 --> 02:40:29,545
..And l want maximum sentence.

1652
02:40:30,687 --> 02:40:32,951
...And lt should be given by
Supreme Court Judge only.

1653
02:40:33,323 --> 02:40:37,783
The proceedings should be infront
of Media & public.

1654
02:40:37,995 --> 02:40:39,656
lf you arrange for all this.

1655
02:40:39,863 --> 02:40:41,558
l'll hand over the kidnapped
people myself.

1656
02:40:41,765 --> 02:40:44,063
There are many cases on
each one of them.

1657
02:40:44,267 --> 02:40:46,292
Each case is in a different
stage of enquiry.

1658
02:40:47,871 --> 02:40:50,339
Suddenly if you ask Supreme Court to
interfere & judge it immediately.

1659
02:40:50,540 --> 02:40:51,302
ls it possible?

1660
02:40:51,508 --> 02:40:52,600
lt must happen.

1661
02:40:54,544 --> 02:40:55,772
lt must happen.

1662
02:40:59,816 --> 02:41:05,015
What l'm asking is not
for my own self.

1663
02:41:05,322 --> 02:41:08,416
But, for those innocent people.

1664
02:41:08,725 --> 02:41:15,756
Who have always been victims of your
injustice & corruption.

1665
02:41:16,133 --> 02:41:19,660
Not for me.

1666
02:41:23,807 --> 02:41:26,867
l'm ready to wait till you
arrange for this.

1667
02:41:28,111 --> 02:41:32,445
Till then, you will not know the
whereabouts of the kidnapped people.

1668
02:41:42,025 --> 02:41:42,821
Get ready.

1669
02:42:07,784 --> 02:42:09,046
Delhi! we must praise that man's courage.

1670
02:42:09,252 --> 02:42:10,742
Whatever he has done,
he is right.

1671
02:42:10,954 --> 02:42:12,751
Mumbai! Every village
must have such a man.

1672
02:42:13,023 --> 02:42:16,288
Bangalore! we'll get justice only when
such people exist.

1673
02:42:16,393 --> 02:42:19,191
Hyderabad! what he has done is right
otherwise we'll not get justice.

1674
02:42:26,970 --> 02:42:28,528
Kidnapper Thyagu's condition.

1675
02:42:28,739 --> 02:42:30,764
Here a man is emotionally insistant
to wipe out corruption.

1676
02:42:30,974 --> 02:42:33,408
Yesterday, a Minister in an interview
says corruption is a normal thing.

1677
02:42:33,610 --> 02:42:37,068
Will he accept if we catch his wife's
hand say it's natural thing?

1678
02:42:37,280 --> 02:42:38,508
That's why, he's giving
such interviews.

1679
02:42:38,715 --> 02:42:40,649
Only a youth can speak so bravely.

1680
02:42:40,851 --> 02:42:42,341
Our support is for Thyagu only.

1681
02:42:42,652 --> 02:42:45,917
Our country will reform only
if many people like him do it.

1682
02:42:46,123 --> 02:42:46,919
You're realistic.

1683
02:42:47,124 --> 02:42:51,185
Terrorist Thyagu gets
public support.

1684
02:42:51,394 --> 02:42:53,259
A special programme on it.

1685
02:42:54,431 --> 02:42:55,955
Do you feel it is justified
what Thyagu is asking?

1686
02:42:56,166 --> 02:42:58,634
What he's asking is
absolutely justified.

1687
02:42:58,835 --> 02:43:03,033
l'm going to file a PlL in
Supreme Court seeking justice.

1688
02:43:03,240 --> 02:43:05,071
They're accusing him of kidnapping.

1689
02:43:05,275 --> 02:43:06,640
Did he smuggle Gold or diamonds?

1690
02:43:06,843 --> 02:43:07,741
Did he, kidnap any girl?

1691
02:43:07,944 --> 02:43:09,411
Did he kidnap a little child?

1692
02:43:09,746 --> 02:43:11,043
He has kidnapped only cheats.

1693
02:43:11,248 --> 02:43:14,115
Why're you spending lakhs for
a Councillor Ward's Election?

1694
02:43:14,317 --> 02:43:15,511
To serve public?

1695
02:43:15,852 --> 02:43:17,979
Will he keep quiet after
spending so much money?

1696
02:43:18,188 --> 02:43:19,382
He'll rob in crores.

1697
02:43:19,589 --> 02:43:21,420
We can't expect justice from them.

1698
02:43:21,625 --> 02:43:23,957
lf we ask mildly, will the
peacock give a feather? We must pluck it.

1699
02:43:24,494 --> 02:43:25,324
What do you want from us?

1700
02:43:25,529 --> 02:43:27,053
Someone has come to seek justice.

1701
02:43:27,264 --> 02:43:29,323
Even if you arrest us,
we'll support him only.

1702
02:43:29,533 --> 02:43:31,763
lf Govt. doesn't accept his
demands immediately...

1703
02:43:31,968 --> 02:43:33,230
We'll fight for him.

1704
02:43:33,436 --> 02:43:36,405
Thyagu is seeking justice
so, we support him.

1705
02:43:36,606 --> 02:43:39,666
We just talk about justice,
someone is doing it in deeds.

1706
02:43:39,876 --> 02:43:41,036
He's a great man!

1707
02:43:41,845 --> 02:43:45,008
A sudden turn has taken place
in Thyagu's case.

1708
02:43:45,348 --> 02:43:54,416
Supreme Court has received 1 7 PlL's
in support of Thyagu's wish.

1709
02:43:54,724 --> 02:43:59,525
Following which Supreme Court has
constituted a 5 Judge Enquiry Commission.

1710
02:43:59,796 --> 02:44:04,426
lt's reported that Thyagu will be
presented before this 5 Judge Commission.

1711
02:44:04,668 --> 02:44:09,002
Who's he? An orphan!
He's threatening a Govt.

1712
02:44:09,206 --> 02:44:12,141
Without getting truth out of
him by torturing him.

1713
02:44:12,342 --> 02:44:14,276
Will you accept his demands?

1714
02:44:14,511 --> 02:44:15,307
l feel ashamed.

1715
02:44:15,512 --> 02:44:17,571
lf you can't, leave him to us.

1716
02:44:17,781 --> 02:44:18,611
We'll take care of him.

1717
02:44:25,488 --> 02:44:27,115
l can understand your anger.

1718
02:44:27,457 --> 02:44:30,893
Don't forget he still
holds 7 lives.

1719
02:44:31,094 --> 02:44:34,495
Then, will Judges pass judgement
accepting his demands?

1720
02:44:34,698 --> 02:44:35,630
Do you want us to accept?

1721
02:44:35,832 --> 02:44:37,390
We won't accept.

1722
02:44:37,601 --> 02:44:39,694
They can't pass judgement.

1723
02:44:40,170 --> 02:44:44,004
Even if they pass, don't think this Govt.
Will be a mute spectator.

1724
02:44:44,207 --> 02:44:45,674
Whether Govt. be a mute
spectator or not.

1725
02:44:45,876 --> 02:44:46,934
We'll not be.

1726
02:44:48,945 --> 02:44:50,572
No...No.

1727
02:44:50,780 --> 02:44:52,748
You keep quite, Mother-in-law.
Let me see, what she'll say.

1728
02:44:52,949 --> 02:44:54,507
l want to see Thyagu.

1729
02:44:55,051 --> 02:44:56,746
Do you insist on seeing him?

1730
02:44:56,953 --> 02:44:58,853
Will you die if you don't
meet him?

1731
02:44:59,055 --> 02:45:00,113
Will you die?

1732
02:45:00,557 --> 02:45:05,358
l would've died...Mother
l would've died.

1733
02:45:05,629 --> 02:45:09,565
When no one listened to
my problem that day.

1734
02:45:09,966 --> 02:45:12,901
Only he listened.

1735
02:45:13,470 --> 02:45:17,372
Dear...my daughter.

1736
02:45:17,974 --> 02:45:20,135
He's a good man.

1737
02:45:23,880 --> 02:45:30,410
Accept Thyagu's Demands.

1738
02:45:30,620 --> 02:45:31,609
Long live Thyagu.

1739
02:45:31,821 --> 02:45:34,346
Long live Thyagu, who fights
for justice.

1740
02:45:36,760 --> 02:45:40,662
We'll wipe out corruption.

1741
02:45:52,876 --> 02:46:04,549
Long Live Thyagu.

1742
02:46:04,754 --> 02:46:06,119
Accepting my demands.

1743
02:46:06,323 --> 02:46:13,593
Judges, TV & Press people & general
public who have come here.

1744
02:46:15,031 --> 02:46:16,259
My heartful thanks.

1745
02:46:23,139 --> 02:46:24,401
l'm one amongst you.

1746
02:46:24,975 --> 02:46:27,068
Why should l be standing
as a kidnapper before you?

1747
02:46:27,310 --> 02:46:29,938
What connection do we've
with the people, kidnapped?

1748
02:46:31,481 --> 02:46:36,077
We too were thinking like you that
Politics & corruption is not our concern.

1749
02:46:37,354 --> 02:46:42,382
Only after losing few lives
because of that corruption.

1750
02:46:42,959 --> 02:46:45,223
We were forced to interfere.

1751
02:46:46,663 --> 02:46:52,329
Getting fed up with all democratic
ways of protest, fast, Rally, etc.

1752
02:46:52,535 --> 02:46:55,766
With no other option...
We chose this way.

1753
02:46:55,972 --> 02:46:57,997
You promised to handover the
kidnapped people.

1754
02:46:58,208 --> 02:46:59,038
Where are they?

1755
02:46:59,242 --> 02:47:01,870
You say that you'll sentence
them to death.

1756
02:47:05,148 --> 02:47:06,638
l'll hand them over immediately.

1757
02:47:08,785 --> 02:47:11,549
l'm seeking justice for the murders
under the garb of corruption.

1758
02:47:11,821 --> 02:47:15,120
When bridges, buildings fall down
people die.

1759
02:47:15,658 --> 02:47:17,523
lsn't there corruption
behind those deaths?

1760
02:47:19,763 --> 02:47:24,029
For Bank scandals, farmers committed
suicide with their families.

1761
02:47:24,234 --> 02:47:25,963
lsn't there corruption
behind those deaths?

1762
02:47:26,803 --> 02:47:30,671
Police who give bribes to Ministers &
allow the brewing of spurious liquor.

1763
02:47:30,874 --> 02:47:32,603
This society has been
facing them regularly.

1764
02:47:32,809 --> 02:47:34,003
Spurious liquor deaths.

1765
02:47:34,411 --> 02:47:36,174
lsn't there corruption behind
those deaths?

1766
02:47:37,614 --> 02:47:40,606
ln a country where 2 lakhs people are
buying cell phones every month.

1767
02:47:40,817 --> 02:47:43,445
Thousands are dying because
of starvations.

1768
02:47:43,653 --> 02:47:46,451
They didn't die in cyclones or of,
disease or of hot sun.

1769
02:47:48,591 --> 02:47:49,819
They're dying out of hunger.

1770
02:47:50,026 --> 02:47:51,926
lsn't there corruption behind
these starvation deaths?

1771
02:47:53,129 --> 02:47:57,156
lnnocent patients die because of
adulterated spurious medicines.

1772
02:47:57,367 --> 02:47:59,164
lsn't there corruption
behind these deaths?

1773
02:48:00,036 --> 02:48:02,504
What's wrong in calling the corrupt
people as killers?

1774
02:48:02,705 --> 02:48:04,570
Who are the 7 people
kidnapped by us?

1775
02:48:05,308 --> 02:48:07,776
All people who embezzled
crores of rupees.

1776
02:48:08,078 --> 02:48:10,638
All people were proved guilty &
sentenced by Courts of Law.

1777
02:48:10,914 --> 02:48:14,645
But, to put a stay to the judgement
appealing in higher courts.

1778
02:48:14,851 --> 02:48:17,615
And using all loop holes in the
Law for their own benefit.

1779
02:48:17,821 --> 02:48:19,550
They're people who were roaming
freely in public.

1780
02:48:19,756 --> 02:48:22,247
People are enraged
seeing all this.

1781
02:48:24,160 --> 02:48:28,494
The punishment you give must
be the highest punishment.

1782
02:48:28,765 --> 02:48:31,359
lf you do support corruption
No, adjournments.

1783
02:48:31,568 --> 02:48:33,160
Only Death! they must get
this message.

1784
02:48:34,637 --> 02:48:35,626
No court.

1785
02:48:36,005 --> 02:48:37,472
They must understand,
it is grave yard only.

1786
02:48:37,674 --> 02:48:39,767
Your judgement must instill
such a fear in them.

1787
02:48:40,276 --> 02:48:43,768
You must punish them with Death,
as expected by these people.

1788
02:48:49,018 --> 02:48:52,920
Law can't act like an emotional individual.

1789
02:48:53,356 --> 02:48:55,620
Even if their accusations
are proved...

1790
02:48:55,758 --> 02:49:00,957
As wished by you, law doesn't have
a right to punish them to death.

1791
02:49:01,197 --> 02:49:04,098
l know that the existing Law
doesn't have that rule.

1792
02:49:04,367 --> 02:49:08,770
We can save this nation from corruption
only if we have such a law.

1793
02:49:09,105 --> 02:49:12,097
Our Politicians should
enact such a law.

1794
02:49:12,308 --> 02:49:14,503
But, those who enter politics
to make money.

1795
02:49:14,711 --> 02:49:15,939
Why'll they make such a Law?

1796
02:49:16,579 --> 02:49:18,604
After getting arrested,
they stand infront on the court.

1797
02:49:18,815 --> 02:49:20,373
Without a crease on their shirt.

1798
02:49:20,650 --> 02:49:25,747
Shamelessly & blatantly they call
it an act of political Vendetta.

1799
02:49:25,955 --> 02:49:27,286
ls he going to change the Law?

1800
02:49:28,391 --> 02:49:30,655
They complain of chest pain &
get admitted in a hospital.

1801
02:49:30,860 --> 02:49:31,884
And get a postponement.

1802
02:49:32,095 --> 02:49:34,962
They change, threaten & bribe
the court officials & cheat justice.

1803
02:49:35,165 --> 02:49:37,258
Are these politicians going
to change the law?

1804
02:49:38,101 --> 02:49:43,198
These people's blood dries up &
they aren't worried about heat, cold & rain.

1805
02:49:43,406 --> 02:49:47,365
They earn money by working as labourers
in forest on road & in factories.

1806
02:49:47,911 --> 02:49:50,209
The milk that they buy for
their children &

1807
02:49:50,413 --> 02:49:55,441
Rice, pulses, kerosene, chilly
salt tamarind which he uses,

1808
02:49:55,885 --> 02:49:57,750
The water which quenches their thirst,

1809
02:49:58,188 --> 02:50:00,782
And the loin cloth which
protects their honour.

1810
02:50:01,057 --> 02:50:03,685
They're paying tax to the
government throughout their lives.

1811
02:50:03,893 --> 02:50:09,729
But the politicians become corrupt &
rob that money with ease.

1812
02:50:09,933 --> 02:50:12,925
They buy properties in &
outside the country.

1813
02:50:13,269 --> 02:50:15,237
And empty the treasuries.

1814
02:50:15,638 --> 02:50:20,735
Not only put the burden of
price hikes on people.

1815
02:50:21,110 --> 02:50:26,241
They file cases of corruption on one
another to prove that they're innocent.

1816
02:50:26,449 --> 02:50:27,882
And they're cheating the people.

1817
02:50:28,585 --> 02:50:32,487
Look at the public which is ruined
by electing such people.

1818
02:50:32,755 --> 02:50:34,279
Look at their feelings.

1819
02:50:34,490 --> 02:50:38,790
Only these people give power to
politicians & send them to parliament.

1820
02:50:38,995 --> 02:50:42,158
All the laws were formulated
for these people only.

1821
02:50:43,466 --> 02:50:47,994
The only place which can give orders
to the government in our supreme court.

1822
02:50:48,805 --> 02:50:54,243
You yourself had enquired about many
unlawful things in this country.

1823
02:50:54,711 --> 02:50:56,440
Human rights were violated at Ervadi,

1824
02:50:56,646 --> 02:50:58,739
And mentally retarded people
were facing, many problems.

1825
02:50:58,948 --> 02:51:00,381
When you came to know about it
you intervened,

1826
02:51:00,583 --> 02:51:03,984
And it was the supreme court which
rehabilitated them.

1827
02:51:04,721 --> 02:51:08,885
All the states took census of
people living below poverty line.

1828
02:51:09,092 --> 02:51:11,060
lt was the supreme court
which gave this order.

1829
02:51:11,294 --> 02:51:13,558
When the supreme court is
able to question these things.

1830
02:51:13,763 --> 02:51:15,526
Why are you not questioning
the corrupt?

1831
02:51:17,934 --> 02:51:20,926
Let your death sentence to
them, be the new beginning.

1832
02:51:21,137 --> 02:51:23,230
Let your judgement be an example.

1833
02:51:23,439 --> 02:51:35,818
Give your judgement...

1834
02:51:37,053 --> 02:51:39,851
How can we give the judgement
without seeing them alive?

1835
02:51:45,628 --> 02:51:46,322
Over there.

1836
02:51:54,837 --> 02:51:57,362
We'll surrender them to you
without even a scratch on them.

1837
02:51:57,573 --> 02:51:58,597
Look for yourself.

1838
02:52:06,282 --> 02:52:09,080
lf we had wished we could've
punished them, but we didn't.

1839
02:52:09,552 --> 02:52:11,611
Because we still believe
the law department.

1840
02:52:20,063 --> 02:52:22,293
We've surrendered them
to you without a scratch.

1841
02:52:22,498 --> 02:52:32,703
Now, give your judgement.

1842
02:52:32,909 --> 02:52:36,003
All interrogated will be
done according to law.

1843
02:52:36,412 --> 02:52:38,880
The law won't abide for your demands.

1844
02:52:39,349 --> 02:52:43,547
Cases against them will have
the lawful waivers.

1845
02:52:44,520 --> 02:52:46,579
We're not ready to
abide by your arguments.

1846
02:52:46,789 --> 02:52:47,619
Move away.

1847
02:52:48,024 --> 02:52:53,291
lf supreme court doesn't punish these
corrupt & unlawful politicians,

1848
02:52:53,496 --> 02:52:55,123
We must only punish them.

1849
02:52:55,698 --> 02:52:56,892
They're punishing the people
who ask for justice,

1850
02:52:57,100 --> 02:52:58,260
And leaving the people
who've committed injustice.

1851
02:52:58,468 --> 02:52:59,332
Kill them.

1852
02:53:00,870 --> 02:53:04,169
Smash those who've
committed mistakes.

1853
