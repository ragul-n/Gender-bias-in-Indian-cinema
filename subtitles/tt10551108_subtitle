1
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:02,200
- You're out late.
- Oh, got club. Music practice.

2
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,680
Been a few burglaries.
Young black lads like yourself mostly.

3
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,280
You won't mind if we give you a quick
search, will you ? Won't take a minute.

4
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,400
- Sure.
- Arms out.

5
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,280
- Hey !
- Oi, oi, jungle patrol.

6
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,800
Yes, calm yourself down, sunshine.
It's a routine stop and search.

7
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,320
- There's been a few B and E's...
- Don't care if there's been a murder.

8
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,360
He's a school child.
In uniform !

9
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,120
- Is this your dad ?
- Yeah.

10
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,640
- You find anything ?
- No.

11
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,280
Then him can go.
Come.

12
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,280
Go on then, son.
And you watch your attitude, mate.

13
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,080
Can I change this ?

14
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,720
Musse a accident. Why I come late.

15
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,840
Now listen me good.

16
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:17,320
When 'em stop you again don't mek them
handle you so. You not no ruffneck.

17
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,720
Yuh hear ?

18
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,400
What if they arrest me ?

19
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,080
Nuh worry bout that.
I am the only authority you need.

20
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,800
I only warn yuh two tings;

21
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:34,800
don't be no ruffneck, an don't bring no
police to my yard. You understand ?

22
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,280
- Yes, Dad.
- Yes, what ?

23
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,400
- Yes, Dad.
- Good.

24
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:48,640
RED, WHITE AND BLUE

25
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,440
Dad ?

26
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,800
- You gonna take all day ?
- You have an appointment ?

27
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,320
Watch now. See.

28
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,160
If you take your time... don't rush in,

29
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,120
you'll get your reward.

30
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,720
- Score me.
- Strikes again.

31
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,120
- That's twenty-eight points.
- Scholar.

32
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,160
U.

33
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,920
I.

34
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,840
- T.
- Sweet.

35
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,640
- Daphne !
- I was waiting for that Q.

36
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,400
- It's right up to the triple score.
- Yeah. It's simple.

37
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,160
Come on. Whose got an S ?
Dad's still winning.

38
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,920
There we go.

39
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,360
And...

40
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,640
SEX

41
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,400
Pass.

42
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,920
Pass.

43
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,080
That's it. Well done.

44
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,680
- Come on then. Come on then !
- Fucking hell.

45
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,200
Come on !

46
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,640
- Fucking hell.
- Get your back into it, mate.

47
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,280
Wait, wait, wait.

48
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,720
So, I was saying, right. So he goes
over to this bloke and this bloke says,

49
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,640
"Oi, mate. Why'd you kick that midget
in the balls ?" The bloke says,

50
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,480
"Well he was standing in front of my
bird saying her hair smells nice."

51
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,800
- What are you like, mate ?
- I plead the fifth, me.

52
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
So what, d'you fancy a swifty tonight
then or... ?

53
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,960
And watch you chat up barmaids
all night ? Nah.

54
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,960
Can't leave it in the car.
They'd either let me tyres down

55
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,160
or they'd nick it.

56
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,120
- Perks of the job, mate.
- Seriously ?

57
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,040
Yeah, deadly mate, yeah.

58
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,720
Hey, so what's going on with you,
then ? Have you made your move yet

59
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,920
or are you still sitting at home
fiddling with yourself ?

60
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,560
Shut it.
Application's in the post, mate.

61
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,520
If forensics ain't more interesting
than research science, look, then I...

62
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,240
Jesus Christ, mate. How many ti...
are you still going on about that ?

63
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:14,680
I mean, how many times have I told you
you wanna get yourself on the beat ?

64
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,080
You'd be perfect.

65
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,240
Look, you're well spoken, you're
clean-cut, you're a stand-up bloke.

66
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,280
- You'd be perfect for that.
- Dunno.

67
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,920
They've even got that campaign for
Afro-Caribbeans going, mate.

68
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,600
- You wanna get yourself down there.
- Great. I'll join up.

69
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,960
You should, ma... alright, no, no, no.
I tell you what.

70
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,920
Listen, you tell me when
and I'll take you for a spin around.

71
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,640
That'll get your blood racing.
Trust me.

72
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,240
- Alright.
- Is that a yes ?

73
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,880
- Yeah.
- Yes ?

74
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,080
Yes ! Yes.

75
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,920
- Okay. Okay.
- Wow, right ?

76
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,680
Let's go this way. Come on.

77
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,760
I can't wait.

78
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,600
Finally a place of our own.
Move out of your dad's.

79
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,560
Wow. All ours. The whole space.

80
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,960
Not for long.
Aren't you forgetting someone else.

81
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,600
Who am I forgetting...
am I forgetting you ?

82
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,560
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry for...
- Come on.

83
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,320
We'll put the bed there,
don't you think ? For the light ?

84
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,000
Yeah.

85
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,480
Yeah, this is nice.

86
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,520
-I love it.

87
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,760
- Yeah ?
- Yeah.

88
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,800
You know that bloke I go running with ?
Ed.

89
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,360
He's a good, good, solid guy.

90
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,800
We're talking and stuff about work and

91
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,160
he reckons I'd make a good
police officer.

92
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,920
On the beat rather than forensics.

93
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,280
So do I.

94
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,640
Yeah...

95
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,800
Well, you would

96
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,640
because you're not really interested in
flipping research science.

97
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:57,480
It's not you. You want to be seen doing
your job and setting a standard.

98
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,400
What's that supposed to mean ?

99
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:05,240
It is a good, solid job with a uniform
you would die for.

100
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,960
Much better than a boring old lab coat.

101
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:12,560
You can be physical and...

102
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,760
it appeals to
your macho, vain sensibility.

103
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,440
Please.

104
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:23,480
Brick rigid, everything done
to the letter...

105
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,000
The Julie mango fall close to the root
isn't it ?

106
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,160
See you later.

107
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,720
- Afternoon, Kenny. Alright ?
- Yeah. One portion of chips, please.

108
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,680
- Have a good day. Take care.
- You too.

109
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,080
- Can I help you ?
- This yours ?

110
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,280
- Of course it's mine.
- Well, you're blocking the highway.

111
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,560
- No, I'm not.
- That's a fifty quid fine.

112
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,080
You not see the people coming through ?

113
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,440
- Are you arguing with me ?
- I'm not arguing with you.

114
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,480
You just make a mistake. Wait there.

115
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,800
You know the regulation ? Because I do.

116
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:20,320
Watch... that is two foot from the...

117
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,440
What the ?

118
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,080
For what ?

119
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,480
What you doing ? Oi ! Get off him !
Get off him ! Oi !

120
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,120
- Watch you fucking mouth, son !
- My name is... Kenneth...

121
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,280
My name is Kenneth Logan !

122
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,440
Welcome to my world,
the lovely world of science.

123
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:42,920
I'm sure you're all excited. No ?
Alright. Okay guys,

124
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,440
we've got your standard equipment over
there as well as your fun stuff.

125
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,200
So what we're interested in right now

126
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:51,040
are the results of chemotherapy's
impact on cancer patients.

127
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,880
Now this is something that
we're doing detailed research...

128
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,080
Leroy.

129
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,480
Come on then.

130
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,400
Come on then ! Come on then !

131
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,080
Come on then ! Come on then !

132
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,760
Leee's on tour. He says hello.

133
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,400
Yeah, bet he does, the wanderer.
Where's he now ?

134
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,120
Australia, America, you name it.

135
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,560
And how are you doing ?

136
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,520
Good. I'm good.

137
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:47,280
- I got my application.
- But you never fill it.

138
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:53,440
Look, I thought about it but I've
wanted to do forensics since A-Levels.

139
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:56,160
- Maybe even longer.
- Leroy.

140
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,360
- Yes, Auntie ?
- I know you practically all your life.

141
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,520
You smart enough for research science,
forensics, whatever you choose.

142
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:11,200
But when I tink about you sitting
behind a desk alone,

143
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:14,640
I can't see it.
You and Leee are the same.

144
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,200
You need to get out there and express
yourself, Leroy.

145
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:22,360
Your talent does not lie
behind closed doors.

146
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,320
It should be a benefit
to the community.

147
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,320
We're looking for people like you.

148
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,960
I've been a police liaison
since you were a child.

149
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:38,400
Your life is yours
and not anyone else's.

150
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,240
Well obviously, we are keeping an eye
on the area and we're trying to...

151
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,680
make sure young lads behave.

152
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,160
Anyway, we'll be in touch and
look after yourself. Alright ?

153
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,840
- Everything alright ?
- Yeah, yeah.

154
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:06,720
Just a bit of petty vandalism, that's
all. It's nothing to worry about.

155
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,200
I dunno, man. There's loads of smashed
windows round this way. Mostly Asians.

156
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,160
That's why you gotta know
the territory, mate. It's...

157
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,480
Grassroots community police
and all that good stuff.

158
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,640
We'll know if it's racists soon enough.

159
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,840
- You strapped in ?
- Yeah, mate.

160
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,200
I don't suppose you get many people
from my background.

161
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,360
Science. Thought I'd be the first.

162
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,080
Have you or any of your family come in
direct contact with the police ?

163
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,880
What do you mean ?

164
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:38,640
Have you or any of your relatives been
arrested and detained,

165
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,960
whether charged or released
with no further action ?

166
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,000
No. Never.

167
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:53,800
If I may, I just wanted to say I
applied to combat negative attitudes.

168
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,440
There are divisions, misunderstandings
and I think I could change that.

169
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,400
- If I'm allowed, of course.
- You're right.

170
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:05,120
Attempts to interact with your people
have fallen quite short.

171
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,680
Recruits from your background,
might be better placed perhaps,

172
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,120
to show where we're going wrong.

173
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,760
Well, I agree with you
one hundred percent.

174
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:17,680
I think we need to look each other
in the eye, man to man.

175
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,680
Given the chance we'll soon realise
we're not different.

176
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,960
I've tried jellied eels,

177
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:25,720
so if the boys are up for it I'll have
them eating rice and peas in no time.

178
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,840
Thank you, Mr. Logan.

179
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:37,320
- Thanks for your time, Mr. Purling.
- Please, Kenneth, not at all.

180
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,280
I'm sorry I can't say more at this
early stage

181
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,880
but I have to say if you were white
these charges wouldn't stand.

182
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:49,800
Do hold on to the fact that you have
a tentative case for unlawful arrest.

183
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,840
- I'll be in touch.
- Right.

184
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,360
So what do you think ?

185
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,520
Me not know.

186
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:12,480
Him keep on 'bout
how me case tentative.

187
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,240
Imagine.
And he supposed to be on our side.

188
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,120
There's a whole heap of charges, Dad.

189
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,800
Obstructing the highway, assaulting
an officer, resisting arrest.

190
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,320
- So what you saying ?
- No, I'm...

191
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,800
Do you...

192
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:30,400
think it'd help to get in touch with
the Commission for Racial Equality...

193
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,240
She's right. It would help to get the
backing of an organisation like that.

194
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:38,400
Just make the solicitor gwaan an do him
job. I want my day in court.

195
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:44,640
I want see them dutty police officer
in the dock.

196
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,440
I wanna look in 'em eye.

197
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:01,000
Presented to
LEEE JOHN

198
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,160
Go there, Leroy.

199
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,880
Okay ! My waist got better.
Loosening up.

200
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,760
Shit ! That's a five-hundred pound
fricking carpet, man.

201
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,240
I'm sorry, mate.
Why you worrying so much ?

202
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:38,440
If I lived in a place like this
I wouldn't worry about nothing, man.

203
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,840
Watch the moves. Watch the moves.

204
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,680
You best stop before you break
something.

205
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,480
I'm getting better.

206
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:58,520
- You wanna hear something mad ?
- Turn the music off for ?

207
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,680
- What ?
- I wanna join the force.

208
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,160
What ? Are you gonna be a Jedi
or something ?

209
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,840
No, no, no, ah...

210
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,240
I wanna join the police force.

211
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,800
Why you doing a face like that ? Act as
if your mum didn't work for them.

212
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:20,560
Yeah, police liaison. Mum worked
with the beast not for them.

213
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,040
Are you serious ?

214
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,120
Look, if a man like me was to stop you
do you think I'd drapes you up ?

215
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,800
Yeah, well this isn't America, Leroy.
Black police aren't all over the shop.

216
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,480
That's exactly the point. Don't you
think it's time things were different ?

217
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,960
What, so your dad can get his head
buzzed by a brother instead ?

218
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,920
No. Not really.

219
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:42,880
I thought you were cool.
What happened to you ?

220
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,040
- Yes ?
- We're looking for Mr. Logan.

221
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,680
- For what ?
- To verify his place of residence.

222
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,720
- Are you related to Mr. Logan ?
- I am Mr. Logan.

223
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,440
We're here to check Leroy Logan's
address

224
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:17,320
as part of his application process
to join the police force, Mr. Logan.

225
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,240
- What ?
- So...

226
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,920

You see what them done to me but you

And just because your boy turned out

You don't hear me calling you ?

250
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,440
Okay, I'm sorry the police came to your
door. I sincerely apologise...

251
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,960

Isn't that what you taught us ?
Isn't that what you drilled into us ?

259
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,720
Study every hour God send ! Don't leave
the house or mix with the black kids !

260
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,800
Educate ourselves at the expense
of our lives !

261
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,600
You made us feel like we could be
a part of everything.

262
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:20,880
You wanted us more British
than the British.

263
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,120
At least this way, Dad,
I can change things.

264
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,280
Dad, seriously,

265
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,680

We should go soon. We're gonna be late.

276
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,320
You're not gonna be by your own.

277
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,960
You're not gonna be by yourself.

278
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:03,880
You can call Mum anytime. You can go
round to the house. Don't mind Dad.

279
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:12,320
It's easy for you to say.
I'm not going round there without you.

280
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,760
Darling.

281
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,560
Right now I need your support.
That's all I need.

282
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,760
You say it like you didn't have it
before.

283
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,360
Hey.

284
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,840
What you are doing is important.

285
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,600
So make it count.

286
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,760
- Love you.
- I love you.

287
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,560
Let us pray.

288
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:34,520
Lord, let us be thankful
for the food you graciously provide.

289
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:40,600
May you protect your servant, Leroy,
whom we love and cherish.

290
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:45,200
Please keep him safe for his six weeks'
police training at Hendon

291
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:50,080
and grant us the wisdom
to accept his decision

292
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:54,120
even as we struggle
in our ignorance to understand it.

293
00:26:55,280 --> 00:27:01,240
In your everlasting name and glory,
Amen.

294
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,960
Amen.

295
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,520
The rice and peas lovely, Miss Jesse.

296
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,520
You cook it with cream coconut,
Auntie ?

297
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:26,280
Yes. That and the white rice.
Both cook same way.

298
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:29,920
I love the sweetness of your chicken.
How did you get it like that ?

299
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,840
I put a likkle Demerara inna de oil.
Just a pinch.

300
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,640
I never cook with sugar.

301
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,680
That's authentic St Lucian, right ?

302
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:49,120
Yeah. Us Jamdowns cook it differently.
Traditionally, we season the meat,

303
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,880
make a hole in the ground,
put the meat in, bury it.

304
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:55,000
Cook it till it falls off the bone.
It's just... it's nice.

305
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:58,320
- That's jerk, right ?
- Yeah, jerk chicken, jerk pork.

306
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:01,120
Maroon back ah yard style cuisine.
It's all good.

307
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,920
So you been making any new music,
Leee ?

308
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
- Did you see me on Top of the Pops ?
- Yeah.

309
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,440
- I loved your last tune.
- I loved it too.

310
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,480
Leroy wanted to be in the band.

311
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,520
What you talking about ?
That's not the case.

312
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,480
- That's not how I remember it.
- You didn't tell me that.

313
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,800
Babe, don't listen to him.
Eat your food.

314
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,160
Okay.

315
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,800
- Ah, yes Leroy...
- See.

316
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:49,920
- Alright, take care.
- You take care. So proud of you.

317
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,040
Make I drive yuh Hendon.

318
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,160
Gretl was gonna drive me.

319
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,200
It's okay. I am tired anyway.
They will take me home.

320
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,680
- You sure ?
- I'll wait by the car.

321
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,960
- Alright.
- Okay.

322
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,120
- Cheers. See you.
- Bye, Mum.

323
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,120
Leroy !

324
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,960
- Alright ?
- Hi, mate. Leroy Logan.

325
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,840
Greg Huggan. Come in.
You just arrived too ?

326
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:15,560
- Yeah.
- Excuse me while I just finish up.

327
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,680
That's a wicked crease, man.
You could draw blood from that.

328
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:22,240
Sandhurst, mate.
You won't get sharper.

329
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,080
- Tell you what, I'll show you.
- Oh, yeah ?

330
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:27,400
- Yeah. Make yourself at home.
- Yeah, thank you.

331
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:32,600
- Mate, the music.
- Ah, Marvin. You like ?

332
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,440
Love. Love.

333
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:39,200
By the left, quick march !

334
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,120
Attention !

335
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,440
Right dress !

336
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,240
Parade-shun !

337
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,200
Ready for your inspection, sir.

338
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,320
Hello everyone.

339
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,920
Yeah, where I grew up,
no one does nothing do they ?

340
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,240
It's a bunch of flippin' no hopers in
the same place, doing the same things.

341
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:42,400
But you know, I ain't into all that.
Like drinking, dole, and mucking about.

342
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:47,320
I did me A Levels, and had a few years
cadets, so this lark made sense.

343
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:51,400
- That's me.
- Thank you, David.

344
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,640
You fancy going ?

345
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:06,240
I'm Leroy Logan. Hi, everyone. I wrote
a ton of stuff but none of it matters.

346
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,520
I'm just chuffed to be here
in all honesty.

347
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:11,320
One thing that I will say outright:
I'm not here to make any friends.

348
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:15,040
I'm here to help to bring change to
this organisation from the inside-out.

349
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,000
And hopefully we do that.

350
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,800
Thank you, Leroy.

351
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,400
Does everyone understand
the instructions ?

352
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,080
Anyone not understand
the instructions ?

353
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:32,960
Well let's see. This is the bleep test.

354
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,560
Your aim is to get to the green line
before the bleeper goes.

355
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:38,320
First bleep will go out
after five seconds.

356
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,120
Three, two, one.

357
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,360
Come on, lads !

358
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,520
Thank you very much, PC Logan.

359
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:48,280
Right, lads. You all know the drill.

360
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:52,960
Once you step in here you have to
subdue and disarm the berserker.

361
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:58,560
Any problems... just remember
your training. You ready ?

362
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:04,000
- Are you fucking ready ?
- Fucking ready !

363
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:06,640
Good. Now, get in there.

364
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,960
Come on !

365
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,840
Formation ! Forward !

366
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,880
- Alright, lads. Calm down.
- That's enough !

367
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:39,640
Come on, it's not a fucking tea party.
Well done, PC Taylor.

368
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:45,520
Well recovered. Well done, Pierce.
Well done.

369
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:48,680
Brilliant stuff, Logan. Good lad.

370
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,000
But this is the tough bit.

371
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:59,560
You have to face that man or woman
in the dock.

372
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:02,600
The defendant.

373
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:06,160
Give evidence against them
and secure a conviction.

374
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,040
And this leads us on
to a further question.

375
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:12,760
How can we move
from your traditional bobby,

376
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:16,520
one that I believe your average
civilian considers outdated,

377
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:21,520
into, well someone who better reflects
the world out there ?

378
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,240
Mr. Logan ?

379
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:30,640
I think we need to get back into
the community. Don't we ?

380
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:34,560
You know, find them where they live.
Build genuine trust.

381
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,520
To quote Robert Peel,

382
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:40,480
"The police are the public
and the public are the police."

383
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:44,560
- You can't see it no other way.
- Thank you, Leroy. Well said.

384
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,080
Be seated.

385
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,840
Well, you are to be congratulated
P.C. Logan.

386
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:06,960
From an intake of what I am informed
was a very strong group of recruits,

387
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,440
it appears that you have come through
with flying colours.

388
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,800
I see you have performed creditably
in all your courses;

389
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:17,120
law, police process and procedure,
and physical training,

390
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,640
our best all round recruit in fact.
Very well done.

391
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:20,960
It's been a privilege, sir.

392
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,560
As you are now a probationary
constable,

393
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:26,840
you will be assigned to street
duties at N Division.

394
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:32,040
And with all this in mind, it has been
suggested that you be invited to be

395
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:35,920
the new face of the current recruitment
drive for coloured officers.

396
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,920
- How does that sound ?
- It's an honour, sir.

397
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,800
Excellent, we are indebted to you.

398
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:45,400
As a matter of interest, why did you
want to join the police force ?

399
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:48,480
It's always been an ambition of mine
since I was a little boy.

400
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,560
I feel I have a calling to protect
and serve.

401
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:54,040
And that was through your friend's
mother, yes.

402
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:57,000
The police liaison officer,
Mr. Jesse Stephens ?

403
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,360
Yes.

404
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:02,560
And finally, how is your father
getting on presently ?

405
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,360
Strong and healthy, sir.

406
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:13,360
Excellent. Well, thank you PC Logan.
You are dismissed.

407
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,240
Thank you.

408
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:32,720
Every day someone falls victim to
crime.

409
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,680
So what do I tell sprog ?

410
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,120
A relief ?

411
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,640
Willis ?

412
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,520
Oh, I love that !
Yeah, alright. Nice one.

413
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,640
Ah, fantastic, good stuff.

414
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:53,400
Alright, mate.
Come here. Show you what's what.

415
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,280
"Golden Boy."

416
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,440
Grab a seat.

417
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,280
Good report.

418
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:50,200
It's very good.

419
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,600
- They obviously rate you.
- Thank you.

420
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,760
- Made friends for life, I hope.
- Yeah, I reckon you did.

421
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,080
Yes, sir.

422
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,960
An' a dickie bird tells me
you grew up here. Is that right ?

423
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:03,920
- Yeah.
- Working your home turf.

424
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,160
- Yes, sir, I am.
- Good man.

425
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,240
And you're doing the ad
for coloured recruits ?

426
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,760
Yes.

427
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:21,560
Good to have a top bobby in the ranks,
but this isn't training.

428
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,760
You've got a right jungle to work.
You know that.

429
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:00,200
Dismissed.

430
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,920
Thank you, sir.

431
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:16,160
Wicked police, boy.

432
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,960
- Dutty Babylon !
- Babylon be true !

433
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Fucking bounty.

434
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,720
What'm Coconut ?
What'm Judas ?

435
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:42,480
- That's Constable Judas to you.
- Yeah ?

436
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:43,560
Move out the way !

437
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,840
PAKIS OUT

438
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:11,560
Sorry, folks. Excuse me.
PC, can I have a quick word ?

439
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,200
Excuse me.

440
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:20,720
Asif, mate. I appreciate your, eh,
experience in these matters, right,

441
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,920
yeah, but it's not particularly helpful
to speak Indian.

442
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,480
It's Urdu. Not Indian.

443
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:32,280
Oh, beg your pardon, sorry mate, yeah,
course Urdu.

444
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:35,600
Nevertheless, representing the Force
as you do,

445
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:38,080
I think English might be a better
choice...

446
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:40,120
Alright.

447
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:51,320
- Do you, eh, speak English ?
- A little, little...

448
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:54,440
Can you slowly just describe
what they looked like ?

449
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:57,200
Two men came from there.
They were white.

450
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:00,680
I sometimes ask myself
if it's worth it, you know.

451
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:04,520
When you're working for people who
don't appreciate you or

452
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:08,360
wanna listen to what we could
actually add to the organisation.

453
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:12,680
I got friends who don't even speak
to me anymore. Call me a traitor.

454
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:19,280
Why am I doing this, man ?
Why are you doing it ?

455
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,520
You have a degree.

456
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:25,400
You were a research scientist ?

457
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:30,600
That's like demoting yourself from
being a chef to doing the bins.

458
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:34,480
I just feel like someone's gotta be
the bridge.

459
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:38,920
And when you're doing that
you just realise you're alone.

460
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:44,160
Tell me about it.

461
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:49,600
I don't see joining the Force
as a demotion.

462
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:53,640
I see it as serving my community
the best way I can.

463
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:01,400
Someone's gotta take out the rubbish.

464
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,560
- Let's go for it.
- Yeah.

465
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,080
Okay.

466
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:27,360
So...

467
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,160
What is the definition of theft ?

468
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:36,400
The dishonest taking of someone's
property, innit.

469
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:39,520
Come on now. Be serious. Is that
how you are going to answer them ?

470
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:42,240
You're going up for promotion.
Not an argument down the pub.

471
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:45,160
Alright. So say, strictly speaking,

472
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:47,960
theft is a dishonest taking of
property,

473
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:49,880
that definition has a number of
variations

474
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:52,080
depending on the stolen object.

475
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:55,680
If I was to say to you,
"You stole my motor car,"

476
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:57,760
that would imply that the theft
is permanent.

477
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:01,880
But there's also non-permanent theft
like joyriding and all dem tings dere.

478
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,000
Better.

479
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:09,000
Okay, define stop and search now.

480
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,920
Okay... skip that.

481
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:17,880
Let's try the Misuse of Drugs Act.

482
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:21,480
Alright, the Misuse of Drugs Act is...

483
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:24,040
- You don't even know this.
- I think it's pretty basic, love.

484
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:27,240
- The suspicion that any person...
-...is taking drugs.

485
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:31,160
BEAT CRIME - JOIN US

486
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:34,520
Here, Mr. Man ? Mr. Man ?

487
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:38,760
How you do ?
How you do ?

488
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:45,800
Do you enjoy being back at work,
Mr. Logan ?

489
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,440
Just me.

490
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:57,240
Hello. You alright, Dad ?

491
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:04,040
- Mum. Hey. You okay ?
- Hi. You okay, hm ?

492
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:08,320
- That's your daddy.
- Okay. You okay ? You good ?

493
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:15,800
Everyone alright ?

494
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:19,840
Yes, we very, very good.
Just have a nice afternoon tea.

495
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:22,760
Don't it ?

496
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,560
What about you ?
Everything okay at work ?

497
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:31,000
Yeah, everything's good. Uh, got mates.

498
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:35,680
Ed's been promoted out of the area
but we're still in touch, and Greg too.

499
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:38,640
- He's over at Sudbury...
- You ready for war ?

500
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:43,000
Them give we a court date.
Take almost a year, but them do it.

501
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,040
That's good, Dad.
That's good.

502
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,520
Yuh father never stop chat bout it,

503
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:55,360
day and night inna me ear.

504
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:40,000
- Oi !
- Shit.

505
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:46,280
Inside. Inside, inside.

506
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:13,640
You alright, mate ?

507
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:16,080
You alright ?

508
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:21,120
No ?

509
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:30,920
Oh, my god... Oh, my days !
Crowns, look at you !

510
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:36,160
Lee said you joined up, you know,
but I thought no way !

511
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:38,240
What you doing here man ?

512
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:40,920
They used to call me Crowns back
in the day. This is PC Miller.

513
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,920
Eh, we actually came to chat to some of
your boys.

514
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,680
Caught them hanging around vehicles.

515
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:47,680
Once they clocked us they scarpered
and dropped this.

516
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:51,360
- They been smashing windows again ?
- Yeah, we suspect so.

517
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:56,360
Alright, then, well, you might as well
just come and look around.

518
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:59,760
- I'm sure they've legged it, though.
- Ah, it's all good. Good.

519
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:02,320
-How you been ?
-Look at... I can't believe it, man.

520
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,120
Police you know.

521
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:07,400
Follow me.

522
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:16,000
There's a door to the back.

523
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:01,360
Dad.

524
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:06,720
- Them ready for us ?
- Not quite, Kenneth.

525
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:10,360
We won't be going to court.
The police have officially capitulated.

526
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:14,840
- Wait. How ?
- Just like that ?

527
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,000
What's going on ?

528
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:19,360
You've a fair judge
and a substantial number of witnesses,

529
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:22,760
plus the fact that the police have
dropped all charges against you.

530
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:28,360
If I'm perfectly honest,
I think they knew they'd lose.

531
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:31,800
Dropped all charges ?
But he's innocent.

532
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:34,080
So that's it ? We won ?

533
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:35,560
It's not so much a win

534
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:39,120
as a recognition of their chances of
victory, Daphne.

535
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:42,960
They'll settle out of court. You'll
get a substantial pay-out, Kenneth.

536
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:47,320
I warrant they'll want to avoid
the publicity. Given your son.

537
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:51,560
What do you say, Dad ?

538
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:55,320
They're playing a long game
and it's not ideal but...

539
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:57,280
it's better than nothing.

540
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:03,600
I want my day in court.

541
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:06,720
I want look in dem eye.

542
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:12,840
That's what them promise, right ?
In this country ? Your day.

543
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:14,480
Yes, they do.

544
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:27,120
So the best we can do is a draw ?

545
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:35,160
Goin' toilet.

546
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:43,560
Right, you're on.

547
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:47,880
Come up my cousin's wedding,
watch us go on the hit and miss,

548
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:50,800
eat a ton of food and party like your
lot, you know.

549
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:54,800
- Probably more... wild, you know...
- Woah, what do you mean ?

550
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:57,360
Jamaicans are the original party
people, remember that.

551
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:00,440
Why d'you think they call us Jamdown ?
Yeah.

552
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:04,280
And he's talking to me in another
language.

553
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:08,160
I  have no idea what he's sayin !
He's wobbling his head and talking...

554
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:12,240
I can't understand a flippin' word.

555
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:15,680
Imagine, he's been in this country
how long ?

556
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:19,440
Now of course his daughter comes over,
starts giving it all that

557
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:23,200
saying how disrespectful I am, and
don't speak to her father like that.

558
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:28,320
Who's being disrespectful ?
He can't even speak to me in English !

559
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:31,240
If she'd had gone on much longer,
I'd have nicked the silly cow.

560
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:34,680
Then those blacks came along and
started causing trouble as well.

561
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:38,440
For a moment, genuinely, I thought
I was in that film, Zulu.

562
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:42,400
Bloody wogs, mate. All the same.

563
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:46,240
Alright, mate. Yeah.

564
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:03,480
Well, I don't know who did that.
I just come in and saw it.

565
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:08,640
That's bang out of order, huh ?
It's a disgrace.

566
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:27,560
DIRTY NIGGER

567
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:40,480
Next time one of you fuckers want to
write this on my fucking locker,

568
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:42,720
do it while I'm fucking here !

569
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:45,520
You fucking pussies.

570
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,600
You see what happened last night ?

571
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:01,240
It was crazy, man.
We need to do that again.

572
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:02,840
You alright, star ?

573
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:14,600
I heard you play the piano
the other day. It was good stuff.

574
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:17,720
You into music ?

575
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:22,680
You should take it up properly.
You're dead good.

576
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:25,920
- Start a group or something.
- Nah.

577
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:29,920
Come on. I've got a mate who done it.

578
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:35,320
He's in the band Imagination.

579
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:40,360
Tours the world. Has all the girl,
"waaa, waaa, Leee, Leee."

580
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:42,200
- Imagination ?
- Yeah.

581
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:44,720
My best mate Leee's the lead singer.

582
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:50,200
I reckon you can do it.
What d'you reckon ?

583
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:57,440
Nah. Nah, that's not for me.
That's for other people.

584
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:37,640
Get up. Move. What did I tell you ?

585
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:45,360
Fucking black cunt.

586
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:59,480
- You got a problem ?
- Yeah, I do.

587
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:01,880
Excessive force is not on.

588
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:07,120
Listen.
Out there it is us an' them.

589
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:10,560
You whistle, we come,
that's how it works.

590
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:13,400
So you can stand there playin'
community liaison,

591
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:16,240
or you can piss off
an let us do our job.

592
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:18,480
Cos if you can't learn how it works,

593
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:23,440
then the last thing you'll feel is some
fucker sticking a knife in your back.

594
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:45,280
- You alright, mate ?
- Move from the door, fuckin traitor.

595
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:48,160
What you one of them, yeah ?
You one of them ? You one of them ?

596
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:52,760
Come back here ! Fuck you, man.
Fuck you !

597
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:57,400
You fucking traitor !
Fucking coconut, Oreo biscuit.

598
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:47,080
It's the bounty. Let's fuck off.
Fuck's sake.

599
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:49,280
Just one second.

600
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:52,480
Felicia.

601
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:56,680
Just asking a question.

602
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:15,200
- Alright, Crowns.
- Hey, Linda. Quick question.

603
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:18,520
Have you seen that kid, Abraham ?
You know, the piano player.

604
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:21,120
- I've been looking for him everywhere.
- Oh man, sweet Abraham ?

605
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:23,280
He got knifed over Sullivan Court.

606
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:26,440
His mum's sent him to his aunt's
for his safety.

607
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:31,080
- Is he okay ?
- I'm not sure, mate.

608
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:33,600
I thought
your lot would've heard about that ?

609
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:37,640
- If I hear anything I'll let you know.
- Please, yeah. I'm looking for him.

610
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:40,120
- Keep your ears out, yeah ?
- Alright.

611
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:49,440
All units, November section.
Premises at Holloway industrial estate.

612
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:52,000
We've got some suspects reported there.
Over.

613
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:54,200
Three-six-zero responding.

614
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:12,880
Control, three-sixty on site.
Backup requested.

615
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:19,200
Stop ! Police ! In pursuit of suspect.
Requesting backup. Over.

616
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:52,920
This is PC Leroy Logan
requesting backup.

617
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:33,040
Stop resisting. Stop resisting.

618
01:05:58,760 --> 01:06:00,680
Dave, call for backup.

619
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:03,720
Get in. Get in.

620
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:10,680
Twenty minutes it took us from Wessex.
There's cars around the fucking corner.

621
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:13,840
You're all over the radio.
The bastards didn't back you up !

622
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:27,280
Waaaaay !

623
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:31,600
Ah, so, okay, okay. So I was...

624
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:34,240
...a friendly game.
We're playing a friendly game.

625
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:40,680
How do you take that long to do a shot
like that ?

626
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:45,920
Why didn't you lot back me ?

627
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:54,040
Can't talk ? All of you guys are good
at talking. Why didn't you back me ?

628
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:55,800
Simple question.

629
01:06:57,440 --> 01:07:00,720
You normally speak.
Why didn't you back me ?

630
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:20,400
Why didn't you back me ?

631
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:23,040
You're silent now.
Why didn't you back me ?

632
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:26,720
I'm out there on the field
with no backup.

633
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:28,520
Answer the question.

634
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:31,240
Are you deaf ?

635
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:34,000
Well, you're not men.

636
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:37,720
It's a struggle.
I'm sick of this. Hey man.

637
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:41,720
Get your hands off me.

638
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:50,120
You back me up or you get slapped up.
How 'bout that ?

639
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,840
At ease.

640
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:10,160
It says we were impressed with your
interview skills

641
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:13,840
and you scored highly on both the
written and fitness portion of the...

642
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:17,280
What did I tell you, mate.
I tell you. We absolutely...

643
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:25,120
Clean sweep, innit.

644
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:47,560
He'll understand.

645
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:53,320
No, actually. Not just now. Lemme get
back to you. Okay, yep.

646
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:57,960
- What couldn't wait ?
- I wanna talk about this.

647
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:02,000
- What about it ?
- Don't play games with me, sir.

648
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:04,080
I passed that test, and you know it.

649
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:06,640
Look, I just want a fair crack,
like everyone else.

650
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:10,680
Games ? What are you insinuating ?

651
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:14,960
You were treated equally
like everyone else.

652
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:19,160
So why haven't I moved up ? Beck has.
Why not me ?

653
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:23,720
Because sometimes in life
it's better to just blend in.

654
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:29,480
Now, that test was fair.

655
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:34,240
I'm sorry if you feel otherwise.
There's no special treatment here.

656
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:45,680
Did I say dismissed ?

657
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:59,920
- How's your back ?
- Fine, sir.

658
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:12,080
Dismissed.

659
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:23,440
You alright, mate ?

660
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:39,600
What happened ?

661
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:44,400
Good luck with this lot, yeah.

662
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:47,480
What d'you mean by that ? Already ?

663
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:12,480
Not one officer looks like me. Not one.

664
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:17,640
I joined the Police Force to bring
change. Period.

665
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,600
I dunno. I just dunno, Grets, and now,
Asif is gone...

666
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:23,360
Don't know what ?

667
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:29,400
- I just dunno if...
- You're talking about giving in.

668
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:32,720
- No, maybe...
- You ?

669
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:39,080
You... Leroy, you're talking
about giving in. You ?

670
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:45,800
You didn't join to be in a group.

671
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:51,000
You do it for the people who get
stopped and searched and beaten.

672
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:55,160
The ones who get thrown in jail for
nothing, the folk who respect you.

673
01:12:57,160 --> 01:12:59,920
You talk about yourself...

674
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:05,240
What about
the sacrifice I make supporting you ?

675
01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:07,160
You think it's easy ?

676
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:11,440
- Huh ?
- No.

677
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:17,480
And now you want to drop out ?
For those racists ?

678
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:22,040
Really ?

679
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:28,680
It's just hard.

680
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:04,720
Just me.

681
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:11,680
Hello ? Mum ?

682
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:16,320
Hyacinth ?

683
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:33,240
Alright, Dad.

684
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:44,400
Where's Mum and Hyacinth ?

685
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:49,400
Hyacinth take you mudda to bingo.

686
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:11,480
My mudda.

687
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:17,560
Let me tell you what my mudda
used to say to me.

688
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:20,880
She says, "Son...

689
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:29,960
if I walk past a cemetery

690
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:32,480
and I see you dig grave

691
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:36,000
and that's all you can do 'cause
you have no learning...

692
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:39,400
she says,
"I will be upset."

693
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:44,760
"But if I pass by there
and you digging graves

694
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:48,240
with an education

695
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:53,560
then that is what you chose to do

696
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:55,840
and I must support that."

697
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:05,360
My mudda, boy.

698
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:11,760
You know I find ?

699
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:15,360
The world just....

700
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:20,120
move forward.

701
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:22,200
Always do.

702
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:30,040
Big change.

703
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:35,920
That is a slow-turning wheel.

704
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:48,800
Sometimes I think...

705
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:51,520
the earth needs to be scorched.

706
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:57,840
Re-plant it

707
01:16:58,520 --> 01:17:01,120
so something good will come of it.

708
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:05,240
Something good.
