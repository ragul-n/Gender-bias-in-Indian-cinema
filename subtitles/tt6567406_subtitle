00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,125


3
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:03,708
5000 years ago, in
South Tamil Nadu....

4
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:07,792
Tamilians invented the ancient martial art
game known as 'Silambam' (Stick Fighting).

5
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:09,500
The history about it
speaks for itself.

6
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:13,167
It was here, on the south side of
Pothigai hills that sage Aghathiya...

7
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:18,125
mastered in 'Silambam' before he mastered
in 'Yoga' and it's healing methods.

8
00:03:19,042 --> 00:03:23,292
In order to defend himself from wild animals
that disturb him during his meditation...

9
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:27,417
he innovated 'Silambam' by tying a
blade at the tip of the stick.

10
00:03:27,417 --> 00:03:30,417
'Silambam' became Tamilians'
defense mechanism and...

11
00:03:30,417 --> 00:03:33,792
'Silambam with Blade'
became a Valor sport.

12
00:03:34,417 --> 00:03:38,083
'Silambam' became the
weapon of valor and defense.

13
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:43,000
Today, the art of 'Silambam' still continues
to be a part of the Tamil culture.

14
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:49,042
'Silambam' doesn't signify Valor alone.
It also signifies Honor and Sentiment...

15
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:42,625
A cotton field full of
cotton buds and cottons....

16
00:04:42,667 --> 00:04:46,042
and you let 2000 goats graze on it. Do you
think anything will remain in the field?

17
00:04:46,042 --> 00:04:48,667
People like you can
make a living anyway.

18
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:52,042
But farmers have no choice. They
live at the behest of the rain gods.

19
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:57,500
Such farmers are unable to cultivate and are
forced to sell their yields at cheaper rates.

20
00:04:57,542 --> 00:05:01,083
As a result, around 15,000 farmers
are committing suicide every year.

21
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:05,167
Over that if you create such troubles then
this family's plight will be the same.

22
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:09,333
He sold his wife's jewellery for 50,000
bucks in order to cultivate his land.

23
00:05:09,417 --> 00:05:10,250
You've destroyed it.

24
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,083
Look here!

25
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:15,625
If you really care, then either give
this family a compensation of 50,000...

26
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,167
or give them 10 of your goats.

27
00:05:17,167 --> 00:05:19,375
Do you have any idea how
much goat meat sells for?

28
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:21,792
Right from Chennai to Kanyakumari
it is 500 bucks per kilo.

29
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:25,292
And each goat I own weighs around 20
- 30 kilos on average.

30
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,792
And you want me to give them 10
goats, like it's no big deal?

31
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:30,792
I can spare some 2000
- 3000 bucks.

32
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:31,542
Dare you!

33
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,750
How dare you talk like
that in Panchayat?

34
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,375
Take away all his goats
and lock them up.

35
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:37,625
Mookiah Devar!

36
00:05:37,667 --> 00:05:39,250
How about a goat
fight challenge?

37
00:05:40,167 --> 00:05:42,250
If you win it...

38
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:45,583
I shall hand over 10 goats plus
the goat that loses the fight.

39
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:46,583
Do you dare?

40
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,750
You!

41
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,375
I am ready to challenge you
and your fighting goat!

42
00:06:03,667 --> 00:06:04,917
Bring it on! Release your goat!

43
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:06,542
Bravo! Atta boy!

44
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,042
Go ahead, release it!

45
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:10,833
Excuse me. Please move.

46
00:06:10,917 --> 00:06:11,417
Move.

47
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:12,333
Move!

48
00:06:14,667 --> 00:06:16,500
Either way the meat is mine.

49
00:06:18,792 --> 00:06:22,000
Ok now that's unexpected. This
one looks quite dangerous.

50
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:24,125
Well, I don't wants
this goat's meat.

51
00:06:24,167 --> 00:06:25,792
It has way too
much of cholesterol!

52
00:06:27,917 --> 00:06:29,000
And so do you!

53
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:34,958
Hold on! Hold on!

54
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:37,458
What is it?

55
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:39,667
Your brother is about
to get into a fight.

56
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:40,417
Is it?

57
00:06:40,417 --> 00:06:41,208
Yes! Indeed!

58
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:44,917
The fight is about to begin!
The fight is about to begin!

59
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,833
Hello! Now listen to this...

60
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:52,667
Who is it?

61
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:54,625
- You know what? Did you hear?
- What?

62
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:58,042
Here it is! Muthuramalingam
is about to get into a fight.

63
00:06:58,042 --> 00:06:58,667
What?

64
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:00,417
The fighting goat is huge!
Make it fast!

65
00:07:12,292 --> 00:07:13,375
Dear Muthuramalingam!

66
00:07:14,292 --> 00:07:15,833
Keep the spices ready mom!

67
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,292
Now what's happening?

68
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:20,125
Don't you worry.
Just wait and watch.

69
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:26,417
Ready! Set! Go! and Dash!

70
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:27,958
Dash it like that!

71
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:33,375
Now give me my notebook!
Give it!

72
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,917
Stop showing your dashing
skills to a kid!

73
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:37,875
Try me!

74
00:07:37,917 --> 00:07:38,875
Don't provoke me sir!

75
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:39,583
I said try me!

76
00:07:44,417 --> 00:07:45,333
Dash it and crash it!

77
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:35,125
Behold! Here comes Muthuramalingam!
The lion in the south!

78
00:08:37,042 --> 00:08:40,083
Behold! Here comes Muthuramalingam!
The lion in the south!

79
00:08:40,292 --> 00:08:43,583
A man with heart of gold
and dear to everyone.

80
00:08:45,292 --> 00:08:48,750
A man with heart of gold
and dear to everyone.

81
00:08:48,792 --> 00:08:52,042
So take a break and pay respect.

82
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:55,708
So take pride and
show some Valor.

83
00:08:56,167 --> 00:09:02,667
Behold! Here comes Muthuramalingam!
The lion in the south!

84
00:09:30,667 --> 00:09:34,042
The nature here
bows at our style.

85
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:35,708
The nature bows to us!

86
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:39,250
Nothing can stand against
the daring nature of ours.

87
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:40,958
Nothing can stand against it!

88
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:44,458
Confidence and courage is
what we are made up of.

89
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:46,083
Confidence and courage!

90
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,625
We treat our guests like gods.

91
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:51,292
Just like gods!

92
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:52,958
We chased away those who
tried to enslave us.

93
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:54,833
We are intolerant
towards injustice.

94
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:58,292
We chased away those who
tried to enslave us.

95
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:00,042
We are intolerant
towards injustice.

96
00:10:00,167 --> 00:10:03,500
We carry the legacy of Vera
Puli Devar and Sandhana Devar.

97
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:07,083
Behold! Here comes Muthuramalingam!
The lion in the south!

98
00:10:07,292 --> 00:10:10,542
Behold! Here comes Muthuramalingam!
The lion in the south!

99
00:10:17,792 --> 00:10:20,875
Hey beautiful women of the land...

100
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:22,625
Hey you birdies...

101
00:10:22,667 --> 00:10:26,250
How about singing a folk song for
our very own Muthuramalingam?

102
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:27,708
Folk song?

103
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:29,792
Now who uttered "Folk song?"

104
00:10:29,792 --> 00:10:30,792
That would be me!

105
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:31,792
You fool!

106
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:35,542
There are various kinds of folk songs.
Which one do you mean?

107
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:36,833
Tell me folk!

108
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:41,917
His name stands for Valor!

109
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:45,417
Apart from that it also signifies Honor!

110
00:10:45,542 --> 00:10:48,833
All you cowards and
back stabbers...

111
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:54,083
step out and you'll face the
wrath of Muthuramalingam!

112
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:14,833
We shine wherever we
set our foot steps.

113
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:16,625
Yes we shine!

114
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:20,167
We abide by law and strive for
the betterment of humanity.

115
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:21,875
Yes we strive for it!

116
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:25,458
We are big-hearted!

117
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,167
Yes we are!

118
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:30,625
No matter where we go, we are
always loyal to our motherland.

119
00:11:30,667 --> 00:11:32,208
Yes we are loyal!

120
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:35,750
Come what may, we never
give up on our relations.

121
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:40,917
Come what may, we never
give up on our relations.

122
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,458
Dedication and Valor runs in our blood.

123
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,917
Behold! Here comes Muthuramalingam!
The lion in the south!

124
00:11:48,042 --> 00:11:51,375
Behold! Here comes Muthuramalingam!
The lion in the south!

125
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:54,917
A man with heart of gold
and dear to everyone.

126
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:58,333
A man with heart of gold
and dear to everyone.

127
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:01,667
So take a break and pay respect.

128
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:05,083
So take pride and
show some Valor.

129
00:12:05,542 --> 00:12:12,417
Behold! Here comes Muthuramalingam!
The lion in the south!

130
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:17,542
What's up Grams?

131
00:12:17,542 --> 00:12:18,667
Stop showing off and move!

132
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:19,792
You better watch out!

133
00:12:21,917 --> 00:12:24,833
I step out of town and you
create a ruckus in the town?

134
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:26,750
I heard you finished
off a fighting goat?

135
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:27,750
Yeah! So what?

136
00:12:27,792 --> 00:12:29,792
You'll be a goner if I
report this to Blue Cross!

137
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:32,125
It was an open challenge
and I accepted it!

138
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:33,042
An open challenge?

139
00:12:33,042 --> 00:12:35,208
Open challenges in Panchayat
have gone extinct!

140
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:38,208
Warriors who once used to
accept open challenges...

141
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,792
have now retired.

142
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:43,000
They are now leading
a retired life.

143
00:12:43,167 --> 00:12:44,875
Who does your dad think he is?
The Panchayat head?

144
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:46,333
Or is he a qualified advocate?

145
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:50,167
Or is he the judge at
Madurai High Court?

146
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:53,708
All the customs, weddings to
funeral that takes place here...

147
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,667
should get my approval!
Now get lost!

148
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:56,833
Go, let your dad know about this!

149
00:12:56,875 --> 00:13:02,083
Ask him to quit heading such open challenges in
Panchayat and rest at home or else he'll face my wrath!

150
00:13:07,667 --> 00:13:09,083
Get lost or I'll stamp you down!

151
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:14,667
What happened Grams?

152
00:13:14,667 --> 00:13:19,167
Why is your face painted all red?
Why are you lying here?

153
00:13:19,167 --> 00:13:22,333
Doofus! Can't you differentiate
between paint and blood?

154
00:13:22,667 --> 00:13:26,417
I got a dashing from Mookiah's son!

155
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:30,958
Damn it!

156
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:32,708
Didn't I just top up
the mobile balance?

157
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:35,083
Now hang up! I'll call
you after reaching home.

158
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:37,333
There you are!

159
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:43,875
So how was the mutton gravy?

160
00:13:44,292 --> 00:13:46,083
I heard it was you who
had major portion of it!

161
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:47,792
Look, in a way I could
be your boy friend.

162
00:13:48,417 --> 00:13:51,208
Let me know and I own 2000 goats,

163
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,333
I shall spare you few more.

164
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:55,500
Look! Me and my family
aren't a bunch of gluttons!

165
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,042
We are known for our Valor and pride!

166
00:13:57,042 --> 00:13:59,125
If my brother finds
out about this...

167
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:00,708
he'll skin you alive.

168
00:14:01,417 --> 00:14:02,167
Get lost!

169
00:14:02,292 --> 00:14:04,208
- Get lost! - Wait and watch!
I'll tell on you to my brother!

170
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,750
Stop boasting about
your brother!

171
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:08,333
What happened dear?
Why are you crying?

172
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:13,208
Ezharai Pandi harassed me! He
hurled a paper rocket at me!

173
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:16,125
Get on the bike!

174
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,042
I said get on!

175
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:34,958
We treat sisters like deities.

176
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,417
It's on! The fight is on!
It's on! The fight is on!

177
00:14:41,667 --> 00:14:42,958
- When will he return the money?
- In 2 - 3 days.

178
00:14:43,042 --> 00:14:43,625
Uncle!

179
00:14:43,667 --> 00:14:45,583
Muthuramalingam and Ezhara
Pandi are fighting.

180
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:46,208
But why?

181
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,208
Who know? It's a fight!

182
00:14:47,292 --> 00:14:47,875
Where?

183
00:14:47,917 --> 00:14:48,792
In middle of the town!

184
00:14:48,792 --> 00:14:49,375
Come on!

185
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:50,167
The fight is on!

186
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:57,750
How dare he harass my daughter!

187
00:14:57,792 --> 00:14:59,292
Butcher him Muthuramalingam!

188
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,125
Uncle! Don't you
butcher him down!

189
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:01,833
Stop yelling!

190
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:12,917
Where is he?

191
00:15:13,042 --> 00:15:13,708
Inside.

192
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:14,708
Break the door!

193
00:15:16,042 --> 00:15:16,542
Break it!

194
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,792
Drag him down here.

195
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,417
Doesn't he pay his
electricity bill?

196
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:22,750
What happened?

197
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:23,833
He is missing.

198
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,458
Come on!

199
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,333
Let's catch that scoundrel!

200
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:27,583
Uncle! Don't finish him off!

201
00:15:30,167 --> 00:15:33,583
Uncle! Don't run so fast! I am
unable to keep up with you!

202
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:37,333
Tell me where is the
whole family headed?

203
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:38,333
To Pandi's house right?

204
00:15:38,417 --> 00:15:40,375
Why run? You guys could
have hired a rickshaw!

205
00:15:41,792 --> 00:15:44,083
Break it! Break it down!

206
00:15:44,667 --> 00:15:46,167
How dare he mess with us?!

207
00:15:47,667 --> 00:15:48,333
Hold this.

208
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:49,042
Is your attire wearing off?

209
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:49,917
This won't work out.

210
00:15:50,292 --> 00:15:50,833
Listen...

211
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:55,958
Run down to that shop and buy as many
notebooks you can for 500 bucks.

212
00:15:56,042 --> 00:15:58,208
For 500 bucks we'll get 10
notebooks and a cool drink.

213
00:15:58,583 --> 00:15:59,083
Cool drink?

214
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,583
I'm exhausted after
all that running!

215
00:16:00,667 --> 00:16:01,917
- Get lost!
- Oh! Oh!

216
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:03,667
Don't stop! Keep hurling!

217
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,750
Here is 500 bucks. Give me 10 notebooks.

218
00:16:08,792 --> 00:16:09,792
Make it quick!

219
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,333
Nice decision to get
educated at this age!

220
00:16:13,417 --> 00:16:16,250
Wait! I'll get done there and then
do the same thing to your house!

221
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:19,375
This guy here mocked me! We must
hurl stones at his house too!

222
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:30,000
Listen!

223
00:16:30,167 --> 00:16:31,458
- Yes uncle.
- Call up Mayilsamy!

224
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,125
You mean the movie
star Mayilsamy?

225
00:16:34,167 --> 00:16:36,417
I meant the scientist
Mayilsamy Annadurai.

226
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:37,542
Ask him to get us a real rocket!

227
00:16:37,542 --> 00:16:40,500
I don't mind if it'll cost me my
whole wealth. I'll get a rocket...

228
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:43,208
I'll launch it on his
house and destroy it!

229
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,708
How dare he harass my daughter!

230
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,708
Uncle do you really mean it?

231
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:48,250
Yes I mean it!

232
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,125
Now go call him up.

233
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,417
Call the ambulance.

234
00:17:09,042 --> 00:17:12,375
Uncle. Please forgive us.

235
00:17:12,417 --> 00:17:13,000
Get up dear.

236
00:17:13,917 --> 00:17:16,875
I agree that it's
my husband's fault.

237
00:17:17,042 --> 00:17:20,417
I very well know that we can't mess
with you and live peacefully here.

238
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:22,333
Please don't harm him.

239
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:23,208
Look here dear...

240
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,708
this is Mookiah Devar's dynasty.

241
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:26,792
We value our honor
and pride a lot.

242
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:28,667
In fact we value them
more than our lives.

243
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:31,500
We'll go to any extent to keep
our family's honor intact.

244
00:17:31,792 --> 00:17:33,583
A good dynasty comes from
living up to one's words!

245
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:35,292
Where as only cheapskates
play with words!

246
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:37,250
Uncle, I promise he
won't repeat it.

247
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:39,833
Listen! If he repeats it...

248
00:17:39,917 --> 00:17:42,125
the your husband will be beheaded.

249
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:42,875
Leave it.

250
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:44,542
She has been pleading
long enough.

251
00:17:44,542 --> 00:17:45,375
An apology?

252
00:17:45,417 --> 00:17:49,917
Her husband deserves to
beheaded for his actions.

253
00:17:49,917 --> 00:17:51,042
Isn't it?

254
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:51,708
Yeah right!

255
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:52,875
Do that and head to prison!

256
00:17:52,917 --> 00:17:54,292
Now see what your dad said?

257
00:17:54,417 --> 00:17:56,292
Give a chance and he'll
push me into prison.

258
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,667
He has a very big heart!
Just like his mustache!

259
00:17:58,750 --> 00:17:59,375
Indeed!

260
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:00,458
Now go draw me a bath.

261
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,417
I can't! Her husband's
actions must be questioned!

262
00:18:02,417 --> 00:18:03,417
Shut up!

263
00:18:03,542 --> 00:18:04,500
Hot water bath right?

264
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:05,958
- Fool!
- Alright I'll get it done.

265
00:18:06,667 --> 00:18:07,292
Look here dear.

266
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:09,708
A burn wound is not poisonous.

267
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:11,875
All our anger has resided.
Don't worry. You leave.

268
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:15,292
Leave. Don't worry
we won't harm him.

269
00:18:22,542 --> 00:18:24,167
How dare you go plead
for forgiveness?

270
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:28,375
Instead of pleading forgiveness to Mookiah
you could have committed suicide.

271
00:18:28,667 --> 00:18:31,833
It is said that in order to ditch our
own people we must be very patient.

272
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:35,833
Mark my words, Mookiah will
die at my hands some day!

273
00:18:36,042 --> 00:18:36,542
Get lost!

274
00:18:58,750 --> 00:18:59,542
There is the bus.

275
00:19:00,417 --> 00:19:02,792
Get down! Get down!

276
00:19:02,792 --> 00:19:03,958
Please get down.

277
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:04,875
Go!

278
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:17,917
A brand new utensil!
Time to flick it.

279
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:22,083
You are good for nothing!
You can't even buy me a utensil!

280
00:19:22,167 --> 00:19:23,917
I pity myself for
getting married to you!

281
00:19:23,917 --> 00:19:27,792
There is no way out of this wedlock
nor it is easy to live with you.

282
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,292
I blame fate!

283
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:31,917
You could've better married
a utensils dealer instead.

284
00:19:31,917 --> 00:19:33,750
You could have got many utensils.

285
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:35,125
All you need is a utensil right?

286
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,042
I shall return only with a utensil.
No matter what.

287
00:19:38,667 --> 00:19:40,708
I better flick this utensil.

288
00:19:48,667 --> 00:19:52,083
Please take care
of your belongings

289
00:19:52,167 --> 00:19:54,917
My dear wife, I have
got what you want.

290
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:56,625
I hope now I'll get what I want

291
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:57,750
Come on.

292
00:19:58,167 --> 00:19:59,083
Why is she getting off her seat?

293
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:01,083
Don't turn. Keep
walking backwards.

294
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,333
What's with the reverse play?

295
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:05,375
Times are tough.

296
00:20:05,417 --> 00:20:06,417
Next stop! Get down.

297
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,833
Get down! Get down!

298
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:09,583
She is a beauty!

299
00:20:11,417 --> 00:20:13,750
Thank god he left with her.

300
00:20:13,917 --> 00:20:14,833
Good times are here.

301
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:19,083
This town is Pathetic.

302
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:22,500
There is nothing but stones here.
Get down! Get down!

303
00:20:22,542 --> 00:20:23,917
It stinks!

304
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:25,875
I hope the conductor
doesn't find out.

305
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,333
ginal..ginal..Original!

306
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:37,500
Here is a new utensil.

307
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:41,667
But then she'll question me where
I got it and ask me the receipt.

308
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:42,375
Idiot!

309
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:44,167
S.M Murugan store.

310
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,083
Let me find out how much a
utensil like this will cost.

311
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:47,333
Greetings.

312
00:20:47,417 --> 00:20:48,708
Yes Singam. What's up?

313
00:20:48,792 --> 00:20:51,292
I just wanted to know how much
would a utensil like this cost?

314
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,083
You should know if you bought it.

315
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:57,042
My wife bought it from your store and it was your
wife who sold it to her. That is why I am asking.

316
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:58,958
Pay me 100 bucks and I'll tell you.

317
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,583
Well, then let me go tell your
wife about your mistress.

318
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:04,208
It costs 700 bucks. Now leave.

319
00:21:04,792 --> 00:21:05,958
That's better!

320
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,125
Looks like his mistress has
better control over him.

321
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,083
I'm raging fire!

322
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:11,292
Try me!

323
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:13,000
What are you doing here?

324
00:21:13,042 --> 00:21:14,250
What are you doing here?

325
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,583
Looks like a new utensil.

326
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,875
Well looks like you are
gonna get lucky tonight.

327
00:21:18,917 --> 00:21:20,917
Now stop joking!
Just like your dad.

328
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:22,875
Fine. I'll leave.

329
00:21:22,917 --> 00:21:23,417
Where to?

330
00:21:23,417 --> 00:21:24,000
Hop on.

331
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:24,792
I'll drop you.

332
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:25,833
Only on one condition.

333
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,875
No matter what happens to those sticks
but my utensil should reach unscratched.

334
00:21:28,917 --> 00:21:30,042
Otherwise my wife will be upset.

335
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:31,708
Now come on. Hop on.

336
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,167
Hand me those.

337
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:35,333
Go tell that I'm back!

338
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:37,958
I'm back with a new utensil!

339
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:39,792
Quiet or I'll leave you
stranded half way.

340
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:41,000
Careful.

341
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,833
These sticks might
poke someone's face.

342
00:21:43,417 --> 00:21:44,417
Stop! Stop!

343
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,875
Why are you all crying?

344
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:51,833
A girl deceived us and
took away all our money.

345
00:21:51,917 --> 00:21:53,917
Please help us. Get
us back our money.

346
00:21:53,917 --> 00:21:55,542
This girl is from your place.

347
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:56,792
I can't do anything about it.

348
00:21:56,792 --> 00:21:58,583
Why do you think so?

349
00:21:58,625 --> 00:22:01,208
We know you fight for justice.

350
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,708
Please come. Help us
get out money back.

351
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:05,458
Who is she?

352
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:06,417
Point me to her.

353
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:10,375
It's her.

354
00:22:17,125 --> 00:22:18,750
Look at her attitude.

355
00:22:18,792 --> 00:22:20,333
Check if she is drunk.

356
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,500
Hey lady!

357
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:36,125
Tell me dear.

358
00:22:37,792 --> 00:22:39,042
What makes me dear to you?

359
00:22:39,042 --> 00:22:40,958
Then what makes me your lady?

360
00:22:42,042 --> 00:22:42,667
Fine!

361
00:22:43,042 --> 00:22:45,042
Why did you deceive these
kids and take their money?

362
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:45,708
What?!

363
00:22:45,875 --> 00:22:46,958
I deceived them?

364
00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:48,708
What do you mean?

365
00:22:48,833 --> 00:22:50,500
They lost the bet.

366
00:22:50,542 --> 00:22:51,833
- A bet?
- Indeed.

367
00:22:51,958 --> 00:22:53,583
Aren't you a grown up?

368
00:22:53,667 --> 00:22:54,750
Return their money.

369
00:22:54,833 --> 00:22:55,792
No. I won't.

370
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,833
Why don't you try
winning a bet with me?

371
00:22:58,167 --> 00:22:58,833
Fine.

372
00:22:59,083 --> 00:23:00,083
What's the deal?

373
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:01,583
I will lie down.

374
00:23:01,625 --> 00:23:03,042
You must turn me over.

375
00:23:03,125 --> 00:23:05,458
Did I hear that you'll lie down and...

376
00:23:05,583 --> 00:23:07,250
he should turn you over?

377
00:23:07,292 --> 00:23:09,667
I've never heard of such game.
Guess you invented it.

378
00:23:09,708 --> 00:23:10,708
How much is the bet?

379
00:23:11,917 --> 00:23:13,125
100 bucks.

380
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,167
What are you wondering?

381
00:23:15,292 --> 00:23:16,500
Take out the money and bet.

382
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:19,708
Give me that.

383
00:23:20,292 --> 00:23:21,958
Oh! Oh!

384
00:23:22,917 --> 00:23:26,083
The money has found the ATM. Only way
to take it out is by using your card.

385
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:28,042
Lie down.

386
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:31,083
Look at that. That was quick!

387
00:23:33,208 --> 00:23:33,750
Ok!

388
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:40,292
No! No. No.

389
00:23:40,583 --> 00:23:41,375
Little more above.

390
00:23:41,458 --> 00:23:42,417
Not allowed.

391
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:45,792
Ok. Allowed.

392
00:23:51,875 --> 00:23:54,125
She looks rock solid!

393
00:23:54,167 --> 00:23:56,083
- Obviously! She looks solid.
- She is rock solid!

394
00:23:56,125 --> 00:23:57,542
Well that is why
she is immovable.

395
00:23:57,583 --> 00:23:59,125
Make it fast.

396
00:23:59,417 --> 00:24:00,833
Win the bet!

397
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:04,292
Arrgh!

398
00:24:06,125 --> 00:24:09,583
Come on! You are an expert in games more
fierce than this but look at you now.

399
00:24:09,625 --> 00:24:10,333
Do something!

400
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:18,375
Body shake! I saw that!

401
00:24:22,292 --> 00:24:23,417
No! No! No!

402
00:24:23,417 --> 00:24:25,125
We'll lose 100 bucks.
Are you fine with it?

403
00:24:25,125 --> 00:24:25,875
Yes! Yes!

404
00:24:32,958 --> 00:24:34,500
Don't you touch me there!

405
00:24:35,958 --> 00:24:38,667
Did you watch that? He even took
the bubble gum out of her mouth.

406
00:24:38,708 --> 00:24:40,000
It's unfair.This ain't fair.

407
00:24:40,083 --> 00:24:44,000
You were asked to turn her over and
see what you made the children watch?

408
00:24:44,208 --> 00:24:46,458
Look, you lost the bet.
Give us the money now.

409
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,417
Take it. Get it.

410
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,125
- Bro!
- What can we do about it?

411
00:24:50,208 --> 00:24:51,125
You cheated.

412
00:24:51,208 --> 00:24:52,625
I won't return your money.

413
00:24:52,917 --> 00:24:54,083
He cheated?

414
00:24:54,833 --> 00:24:56,333
Listen to me. You know what...

415
00:25:21,083 --> 00:25:22,250
It's quite heavy.

416
00:25:22,542 --> 00:25:24,625
I think the owner had
filled it with snacks.

417
00:25:26,917 --> 00:25:28,583
There is no one around.

418
00:25:28,833 --> 00:25:30,375
Let me get in and
check what's in it.

419
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,417
It's tight.

420
00:25:35,417 --> 00:25:37,750
What if it's full of gold?
I'll be rich.

421
00:25:44,375 --> 00:25:45,958
Oh my god! Guess
he died laughing.

422
00:25:49,208 --> 00:25:51,167
What is he doing inside
the damaged house?

423
00:25:52,208 --> 00:25:53,042
Who's that?

424
00:25:53,333 --> 00:25:53,917
Come here.

425
00:25:53,958 --> 00:25:56,250
Sir? Wait.I'll be
there in a moment.

426
00:25:58,042 --> 00:25:59,750
What are you doing
here in the dark?

427
00:26:00,042 --> 00:26:01,625
Sir, I was taking a leak.

428
00:26:01,625 --> 00:26:03,125
You mean in the utensil?

429
00:26:03,125 --> 00:26:04,667
Nope. Outside.

430
00:26:04,708 --> 00:26:06,417
You said you were
taking a leak inside...

431
00:26:06,417 --> 00:26:07,625
but now you change
it to outside?

432
00:26:07,667 --> 00:26:09,125
Why are you blabbering?

433
00:26:09,125 --> 00:26:10,125
Tell me the truth.

434
00:26:10,333 --> 00:26:11,875
Did you take a leak
inside or outside?

435
00:26:11,917 --> 00:26:14,000
I took a leak outside.

436
00:26:14,042 --> 00:26:16,458
A guy was beheaded in town.

437
00:26:16,708 --> 00:26:19,000
We found the body but we
are yet to find the head.

438
00:26:19,375 --> 00:26:21,625
If you find the head anywhere,
can you bring it to me?

439
00:26:21,833 --> 00:26:23,792
Let me not arrest you
in the name of doubt.

440
00:26:23,875 --> 00:26:25,417
So go home before it's late.

441
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:26,417
Go! Leave!

442
00:26:26,458 --> 00:26:27,667
Run! Leave.

443
00:26:30,917 --> 00:26:32,125
There you are my dear!

444
00:26:32,333 --> 00:26:34,708
Looks like you finally
got me an utensil.

445
00:26:35,292 --> 00:26:37,708
A real man is the one who
pleads guilty for his mistakes.

446
00:26:37,917 --> 00:26:43,333
But the one who gets bashed for no reason and
yet shows love by buying stuffs is my Man!

447
00:26:44,458 --> 00:26:46,583
Move away you pot head!

448
00:26:53,625 --> 00:26:55,000
Where did he go?

449
00:26:59,458 --> 00:27:00,375
Dear?

450
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:01,500
Dear!

451
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:02,250
What is it?

452
00:27:02,292 --> 00:27:05,750
Why are you hugging the utensil
instead you could hug me?

453
00:27:05,875 --> 00:27:09,583
Well, I could do that to
someone else for a change.

454
00:27:09,625 --> 00:27:12,083
Yeah right! You haven't
mastered the solo act yet...

455
00:27:12,125 --> 00:27:15,625
yet look at you yearning
for a group act!

456
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:17,125
Group act!

457
00:27:17,125 --> 00:27:18,333
Oops! There goes the utensil.

458
00:27:18,333 --> 00:27:20,167
He can't handle me
properly and over that...

459
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:30,625
Welcome professor.

460
00:27:30,833 --> 00:27:32,042
Greetings Mookiah Devar.

461
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:33,125
- Muthuramalingam
- Yes dad.

462
00:27:33,125 --> 00:27:34,125
Get a chair.

463
00:27:34,208 --> 00:27:35,292
Hope you are doing fine.

464
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,375
I am so happy Mookiah Devar.

465
00:27:37,583 --> 00:27:43,292
I read about you training the youths in
Silambam for national level competition.

466
00:27:43,833 --> 00:27:45,875
You don't have to
praise me for it.

467
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,542
You train and educate the youths in school.

468
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:52,208
And I train them to be strong
and daring using this sport.

469
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:52,792
That's all.

470
00:27:52,875 --> 00:27:54,458
Tell me, how can I help you.

471
00:27:54,625 --> 00:27:58,708
It would be great if you can also teach
Silambam to the kids at the school.

472
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:00,792
We are ready to do anything
you demand as compensation.

473
00:28:00,792 --> 00:28:02,208
Spare me the formality.

474
00:28:02,375 --> 00:28:05,500
My son, Muthuramalingam is
a better trainer than me.

475
00:28:05,542 --> 00:28:07,292
I'll send him. You do the needful.

476
00:28:07,333 --> 00:28:08,375
Happy to hear this.

477
00:28:08,417 --> 00:28:09,250
- See you.
- Ok.

478
00:28:10,583 --> 00:28:14,125
Hello Psycho doctor. My
husband has turned into a psycho.

479
00:28:14,292 --> 00:28:17,542
He seems to be obsessed
with an utensil.

480
00:28:17,708 --> 00:28:20,458
Please cure him doctor.

481
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:23,667
I am not a Psycho doctor.

482
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:26,792
I am a doctor who
treats the psychos.

483
00:28:27,125 --> 00:28:29,458
So, get your husband.

484
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:32,333
Ok Psycho Doctor.

485
00:28:32,667 --> 00:28:33,875
Naughty woman!

486
00:28:35,125 --> 00:28:36,625
Get inside!

487
00:28:36,625 --> 00:28:37,125
There he is.

488
00:28:37,417 --> 00:28:38,125
Wait!

489
00:28:38,167 --> 00:28:40,292
Please come in. Come in.

490
00:28:43,125 --> 00:28:44,625
Welcome you psycho.

491
00:28:44,667 --> 00:28:46,125
Greeting Psycho doctor.

492
00:28:46,625 --> 00:28:48,292
So what are you doing?

493
00:28:48,375 --> 00:28:50,583
I am sitting here
and talking to you.

494
00:28:51,125 --> 00:28:52,333
Correct!

495
00:28:52,458 --> 00:28:54,208
I didn't mean that.

496
00:28:54,458 --> 00:28:56,208
What do you do?

497
00:28:56,583 --> 00:28:57,750
I'm a collector!

498
00:28:57,958 --> 00:28:59,042
A collector?

499
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:04,292
Once the Silambam training is done I
collect the sticks from the trainee.

500
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:08,375
I then clean all the sticks, smooth them
with oil and then stack them up in order.

501
00:29:08,375 --> 00:29:09,958
Doesn't that make
me a collector?

502
00:29:10,375 --> 00:29:12,958
His activities are very similar
to that of a mentally challenged.

503
00:29:12,958 --> 00:29:14,625
Let me treat him by
getting into his head.

504
00:29:14,625 --> 00:29:16,458
Does the doctor find me funny?

505
00:29:17,625 --> 00:29:19,292
- He is laughing at me!
- I am too not a doctor.

506
00:29:19,292 --> 00:29:20,208
So you are a fraud?

507
00:29:20,333 --> 00:29:22,083
Well, I am your friend.

508
00:29:22,125 --> 00:29:22,958
Sorry doctor.

509
00:29:23,125 --> 00:29:25,000
I don't prefer boys
being my friend.

510
00:29:25,167 --> 00:29:27,583
I already have a friend.
Her name is Kanchana.

511
00:29:27,625 --> 00:29:29,708
Her name is Conjuring?

512
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:33,458
Well you can say that. My wife is
indeed the ghost from Conjuring.

513
00:29:33,458 --> 00:29:34,833
Excuse me Doctor.

514
00:29:34,875 --> 00:29:36,000
I've a request.

515
00:29:36,083 --> 00:29:37,833
Don't tell my wife
what I just said.

516
00:29:38,375 --> 00:29:40,125
You've been locked.

517
00:29:41,125 --> 00:29:43,458
Will you obey me now?

518
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,125
I shall.

519
00:29:44,208 --> 00:29:46,333
I'll give you a Pen.

520
00:29:46,792 --> 00:29:48,292
In return what will you give me?

521
00:29:48,333 --> 00:29:50,417
If Pen is short form of Penny then
I shall gift you a grandchild!

522
00:29:50,417 --> 00:29:51,167
Stupid!

523
00:29:51,792 --> 00:29:54,875
If I give you a pen you must
give me a pencil in return.

524
00:29:54,917 --> 00:29:55,625
Ok?

525
00:29:55,667 --> 00:29:57,625
Arrgh! What do you
really need me to do?

526
00:29:57,708 --> 00:29:58,542
Come to the point.

527
00:29:58,625 --> 00:30:00,000
Give me that utensil!

528
00:30:00,042 --> 00:30:00,875
No I won't!

529
00:30:01,292 --> 00:30:03,000
He is quite stubborn!

530
00:30:03,125 --> 00:30:05,292
What do you have
there inside it?

531
00:30:05,958 --> 00:30:07,250
Is that what you want to know?

532
00:30:07,458 --> 00:30:08,708
I definitely wanna know.

533
00:30:08,708 --> 00:30:09,750
- Are you sure?
- Sure!

534
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:11,208
- Really?
- I swear!

535
00:30:11,833 --> 00:30:12,958
Then, here take a peak.

536
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:21,583
What's wrong with the doctor?

537
00:30:22,167 --> 00:30:24,292
I let him take a peak in this.

538
00:30:24,625 --> 00:30:27,167
Now move! Stop pushing
me into trouble.

539
00:30:27,208 --> 00:30:28,833
Idiot! Doofus!

540
00:30:31,333 --> 00:30:34,042
I shall introduce
you to my friend.

541
00:30:34,792 --> 00:30:36,458
Oh! Oh! What is he
doing with her?

542
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,583
That's her.

543
00:30:40,042 --> 00:30:41,958
Viji, this is my brother.

544
00:30:41,958 --> 00:30:42,917
Muthuramalingam.

545
00:30:49,875 --> 00:30:51,750
Oh! Oh! There he goes.

546
00:30:51,917 --> 00:30:54,750
I hope he hasn't told his sister
about what happened between us.

547
00:30:55,083 --> 00:30:55,750
Hello.

548
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:58,167
And now he wants a shake hand?

549
00:30:58,667 --> 00:30:59,833
Ok. I can handle it.

550
00:31:01,417 --> 00:31:02,542
What's with the ticking?

551
00:31:06,125 --> 00:31:06,875
Viji!

552
00:31:07,417 --> 00:31:09,083
Looks like she has fainted.

553
00:31:09,333 --> 00:31:10,708
Get some water.

554
00:31:10,917 --> 00:31:12,542
- Look what you did?
- Give that to me.

555
00:31:13,042 --> 00:31:14,042
Sprinkle it!

556
00:31:15,292 --> 00:31:16,000
Viji!

557
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:18,667
- Wake up!
- Viji!

558
00:31:28,792 --> 00:31:32,292
What do you guys
feed him at home?

559
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,000
He has a strong head!

560
00:31:36,542 --> 00:31:37,208
Come let's go.

561
00:31:42,542 --> 00:31:43,208
Viji...

562
00:31:43,375 --> 00:31:44,625
this is nothing.

563
00:31:44,708 --> 00:31:47,958
He has defeated a fighting goat!

564
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:50,708
You are lucky that
you have no wounds.

565
00:31:50,792 --> 00:31:52,458
I pet many birds. I'll
show you someday.

566
00:31:53,583 --> 00:31:54,958
He defeated a fighting goat!

567
00:31:57,792 --> 00:31:58,583
Dear students.

568
00:31:58,792 --> 00:32:00,458
In today's modern world...

569
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:04,292
form of arts in our Tamil
culture are slowly fading.

570
00:32:04,458 --> 00:32:08,750
In attempt to teach today's
generation about it...

571
00:32:08,917 --> 00:32:13,583
we are introducing Silambam
as a new subject from today.

572
00:32:13,667 --> 00:32:15,458
Our former student
Muthuramalingam...

573
00:32:15,708 --> 00:32:18,833
will be your Silambam trainer.
He will be training you all.

574
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,083
My best wishes to all of you, who
have turned up to learn Silambam.

575
00:32:22,583 --> 00:32:24,042
- Come on madam.
- Yes sir.

576
00:32:24,958 --> 00:32:27,042
Do anyone of you know
what is Silambam?

577
00:32:27,083 --> 00:32:28,375
This stick is made out of Bamboo.

578
00:32:28,375 --> 00:32:29,708
It is used to fight.

579
00:32:29,833 --> 00:32:30,417
Anything else?

580
00:32:30,417 --> 00:32:31,833
It's a defense mechanism.

581
00:32:31,875 --> 00:32:33,167
Those are the obvious facts.

582
00:32:33,458 --> 00:32:34,375
There is more to it.

583
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:35,875
This is an extension of our hand.

584
00:32:36,042 --> 00:32:37,292
Is it? How?

585
00:32:37,292 --> 00:32:40,667
Hands are the first part of our body that
helps us to defend when we are weaponless.

586
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,958
So when our hand
wields this stick...

587
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,125
it becomes an extension of
our hand and saves us.

588
00:32:45,167 --> 00:32:48,458
So wield the stick and make
other understand your point.

589
00:32:48,875 --> 00:32:51,333
You seem to be the eldest among all here.
So come on.

590
00:33:00,042 --> 00:33:01,292
What are you wondering?

591
00:33:02,083 --> 00:33:04,500
This ain't one of
your tricky games.

592
00:33:05,042 --> 00:33:05,667
Wield it.

593
00:33:23,583 --> 00:33:24,958
Now, how about that!

594
00:33:28,417 --> 00:33:30,042
I know Silambam.

595
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,292
So can you teach
me anything else?

596
00:33:35,042 --> 00:33:36,042
What was that?

597
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,125
Well, can you teach me
Silambam with blade?

598
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:43,042
Not here.

599
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:44,583
Come to my place.

600
00:33:44,833 --> 00:33:46,333
I'll teach you.

601
00:33:53,958 --> 00:33:55,125
Listen to me oh spirit!

602
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,333
Tell me who are you?

603
00:33:56,417 --> 00:33:57,542
Where have you come from?

604
00:33:57,583 --> 00:33:59,708
Why have you possessed him?
Leave his body!

605
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:04,208
Hey! I am allergic to dust.
I also have sinus problems.

606
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:05,917
This spirit seems
to be literate.

607
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:06,917
Don't cave in.

608
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,167
It is trying to deceive you.

609
00:34:08,583 --> 00:34:09,417
Leave his body!

610
00:34:09,625 --> 00:34:11,792
I'm sorry exorcist!
I can't.

611
00:34:11,833 --> 00:34:13,083
Why?

612
00:34:13,125 --> 00:34:15,083
If I do so I'll be in soup!

613
00:34:15,083 --> 00:34:16,625
What do you mean?

614
00:34:16,708 --> 00:34:17,958
The truth will be out.

615
00:34:17,958 --> 00:34:19,458
What is the truth?

616
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:22,125
You have no idea. That truth
will invite me troubles.

617
00:34:22,125 --> 00:34:24,000
Stop repeating yourself.

618
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,542
Show me what's inside it!

619
00:34:26,583 --> 00:34:27,917
No I won't.

620
00:34:27,958 --> 00:34:29,833
Looks like you won't budge.

621
00:34:30,042 --> 00:34:31,583
Please get rid of this spirit.

622
00:34:31,625 --> 00:34:32,083
You!

623
00:34:32,083 --> 00:34:33,875
It'll cost you extra.

624
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,875
I'll pay anything you demand.

625
00:34:35,875 --> 00:34:37,708
The spirit doesn't
seem to answer.

626
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:38,625
You are right.

627
00:34:38,667 --> 00:34:43,000
The spirit will leave him only if
his hair is nailed to a palm tree.

628
00:34:43,458 --> 00:34:45,958
Does it hurt? Does it? Does it?

629
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,750
Hey you! How will that hurt me?

630
00:34:48,792 --> 00:34:49,750
Who the hell are you?

631
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:51,292
Let's not talk about me.

632
00:34:51,542 --> 00:34:54,500
I know very well what's
inside that utensil.

633
00:34:54,542 --> 00:34:55,333
Tell me!

634
00:34:55,333 --> 00:34:56,792
The body is in the town...

635
00:34:57,708 --> 00:34:59,167
the severed head is inside it.

636
00:34:59,958 --> 00:35:03,458
If I rat you out to the cops, you'll
be in prison for seven years.

637
00:35:03,583 --> 00:35:05,542
The eight year, they'll hang you.

638
00:35:05,583 --> 00:35:06,208
Please no!

639
00:35:06,375 --> 00:35:07,792
Please don't involve the cops.

640
00:35:07,833 --> 00:35:09,375
Demand me anything.

641
00:35:09,417 --> 00:35:10,542
Give me all your valuables.

642
00:35:10,792 --> 00:35:11,333
What?

643
00:35:11,333 --> 00:35:12,500
Valuables! Now!

644
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:17,917
Is that all?

645
00:35:17,958 --> 00:35:18,792
Yes.

646
00:35:18,792 --> 00:35:19,458
Hand it over.

647
00:35:19,792 --> 00:35:20,375
Take it.

648
00:35:20,417 --> 00:35:21,417
Is she your mistress?

649
00:35:21,875 --> 00:35:22,667
She has a shiny skin!

650
00:35:22,667 --> 00:35:23,458
Close your eyes!

651
00:35:23,458 --> 00:35:24,667
What's with the one eyed look!

652
00:35:24,875 --> 00:35:26,250
- Are your eyes closed?
- Yes!

653
00:35:28,375 --> 00:35:29,250
They escaped!

654
00:35:30,542 --> 00:35:32,458
Get down! Get down!

655
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:34,917
Look here...

656
00:35:35,417 --> 00:35:37,208
this place isn't like ours.

657
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:38,958
Here I am the head!

658
00:35:39,292 --> 00:35:43,583
Everyone obeys me here.
I rule this place.

659
00:35:43,625 --> 00:35:44,750
You haven't changed a bit.

660
00:35:45,083 --> 00:35:48,042
Don't create a division in this place
like you did in the earlier one.

661
00:35:49,667 --> 00:35:51,792
Welcome " Mr. Educated!" How are you?

662
00:35:51,833 --> 00:35:52,417
I am fine.

663
00:35:52,417 --> 00:35:53,000
Who is she?

664
00:35:53,125 --> 00:35:54,417
- This is my wife.
- Greetings.

665
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:57,667
I finally managed to get a transfer
to a hospital here, at my native.

666
00:35:57,833 --> 00:35:59,750
Enough of staying
away from the family.

667
00:35:59,958 --> 00:36:02,667
So where are your children?

668
00:36:04,208 --> 00:36:05,667
We don't have children.

669
00:36:06,208 --> 00:36:07,417
Don't mistake me.

670
00:36:07,458 --> 00:36:08,625
I didn't mean to hurt you guys.

671
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:09,792
We shall take leave.

672
00:36:09,833 --> 00:36:10,500
Ok.

673
00:36:11,167 --> 00:36:11,667
Come on.

674
00:36:13,667 --> 00:36:14,458
Come on Nachiya.

675
00:36:15,042 --> 00:36:17,083
Poor souls. It must
have hurt them.

676
00:36:17,333 --> 00:36:19,792
Their expression show how
depressed they are about it.

677
00:36:20,292 --> 00:36:21,958
Forget it. You didn't
ask on purpose.

678
00:36:22,083 --> 00:36:23,292
They won't mistake you.

679
00:36:23,458 --> 00:36:25,583
Isn't he Mookiah Devar?

680
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:28,000
Indeed. How do you
know about him?

681
00:36:28,417 --> 00:36:31,458
He is quite famous for
his Silambam skills.

682
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:38,208
Hello!

683
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,375
Yes you!

684
00:36:40,083 --> 00:36:41,500
- Who is she talking to?
- Not us.

685
00:36:42,417 --> 00:36:44,083
I am talking to you folks.

686
00:36:44,667 --> 00:36:45,958
First, get down then talk.

687
00:36:50,042 --> 00:36:52,542
Where is Silambam trainer
Muthuramalingam's training field?

688
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,458
Who are you dear?

689
00:36:56,417 --> 00:36:57,292
His wife to be.

690
00:36:57,375 --> 00:36:59,375
When husband summons
wife must come down.

691
00:37:02,292 --> 00:37:04,167
You look so young.Stop
talking like that.

692
00:37:04,417 --> 00:37:06,000
Why did he ask you to come down?

693
00:37:06,167 --> 00:37:09,375
He told me to come down to his place and
promised to teach Silambam with blade.

694
00:37:09,625 --> 00:37:12,833
Won't you think twice when a
boy invites you to his place?

695
00:37:12,958 --> 00:37:15,292
When that boy is my boy friend,
why should I be worried?

696
00:37:15,292 --> 00:37:16,250
Boy friend?

697
00:37:19,792 --> 00:37:22,083
Are you both indeed in love?

698
00:37:22,292 --> 00:37:24,292
Does his parents know about this?

699
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:26,875
Now, why would his
parents know about it?

700
00:37:27,208 --> 00:37:29,458
Why are you both so curious?

701
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:32,042
Can you tell me where's the
groom's training field or no?

702
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:35,708
You groom Muthuramalingam's
training field is by my field.

703
00:37:35,792 --> 00:37:36,708
Come I'll show you.

704
00:37:36,792 --> 00:37:37,458
Hold on!

705
00:37:37,708 --> 00:37:40,208
By walk? That would be time consuming.
Get in the car.

706
00:37:40,375 --> 00:37:41,125
Please get in.

707
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,292
Come. Get in.

708
00:37:45,875 --> 00:37:46,500
Get in.

709
00:37:49,583 --> 00:37:50,500
Quick!

710
00:37:50,542 --> 00:37:51,750
Now where do I place this?

711
00:37:54,125 --> 00:37:54,833
All set. Leave.

712
00:38:00,958 --> 00:38:01,667
Stop here.

713
00:38:02,958 --> 00:38:04,667
This is Muthuramalingam's
training field.

714
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:06,583
Have a good look.

715
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,667
Fine. My groom is coming here.
Dear elders, please leave.

716
00:38:16,792 --> 00:38:19,875
These elders are so curious to know
about us. They ask to many questions.

717
00:38:20,417 --> 00:38:21,500
Do you know who they are?

718
00:38:21,625 --> 00:38:22,667
Your neighbors.

719
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:25,958
They are my parents.

720
00:38:26,792 --> 00:38:29,833
Oh! Oh! My dear in laws...

721
00:38:29,875 --> 00:38:31,333
please forgive me.

722
00:38:31,333 --> 00:38:34,292
I didn't realize whom I was talking to.
Please forgive me.

723
00:38:34,333 --> 00:38:37,167
Forgive me dear in laws.

724
00:38:37,208 --> 00:38:39,958
Only if you forgive
me, I shall get up.

725
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,083
Now get up dear.

726
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,167
Don't be worried. Get up.

727
00:38:44,542 --> 00:38:47,750
You seem to be quite an enthusiastic.
Tell us about yourself.

728
00:38:47,833 --> 00:38:50,500
Dad, she is
Shenbagam's classmate.

729
00:38:50,583 --> 00:38:52,750
My dad is Thenarasu.
He is a MLA.

730
00:38:53,542 --> 00:38:56,208
So you are ex-MLA
Thenarasu's daughter?

731
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:57,792
Your dad is a good
friend of mine.

732
00:38:57,833 --> 00:39:00,083
Muthuramalingam she is
my friend's daughter.

733
00:39:00,083 --> 00:39:02,208
Her dad is pretty close to me.
So train her well.

734
00:39:02,208 --> 00:39:02,792
Ok dad.

735
00:39:02,792 --> 00:39:03,292
Come on.

736
00:39:11,958 --> 00:39:12,792
Stand right there.

737
00:39:13,583 --> 00:39:14,917
Watch out. You might get hurt.

738
00:39:33,708 --> 00:39:35,917
This is how you hold a Silambam
with a blade tied to it.

739
00:39:35,917 --> 00:39:36,500
Like this.

740
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:37,833
Grip it harder.

741
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,292
I said stand there. Move!

742
00:39:58,792 --> 00:40:00,875
Viji, get me that cloth.

743
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,167
What are you looking at?

744
00:40:29,292 --> 00:40:32,042
She dazzles with the Silambam..

745
00:40:32,208 --> 00:40:35,083
looks like she is also
an expert in love.

746
00:40:38,417 --> 00:40:41,250
She dazzles with the Silambam..

747
00:40:41,458 --> 00:40:44,208
looks like she is also
an expert in love

748
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:50,458
There is something about
you that mesmerizes me.

749
00:40:50,625 --> 00:40:56,458
This is a new kind of
experience and I am loving it.

750
00:40:56,500 --> 00:41:02,500
So come to me my love
and let's unite.

751
00:41:02,542 --> 00:41:08,542
So come to me my love
and let's unite.

752
00:41:08,708 --> 00:41:11,417
She dazzles with the Silambam..

753
00:41:11,875 --> 00:41:14,542
looks like she is also
an expert in love.

754
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,625
She dazzles with the Silambam..

755
00:41:17,833 --> 00:41:20,625
looks like she is also
an expert in love

756
00:41:54,417 --> 00:41:57,542
The way you look at me
and make me feel...

757
00:42:00,375 --> 00:42:03,583
makes me feel bliss
and I lose control.

758
00:42:06,375 --> 00:42:09,500
Love is an ocean and
tough to understand.

759
00:42:12,417 --> 00:42:15,792
Why don't you come to me and
teach me more about it.

760
00:42:18,667 --> 00:42:24,625
This is a whole new experience
and I am loving it.

761
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:30,708
This is the world of love and
it's time for us to explore it.

762
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:33,625
There is a lot we
could learn in love.

763
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:37,000
This is our time to
get lost in love.

764
00:42:37,042 --> 00:42:42,667
So come to me my love
and let's unite.

765
00:42:42,833 --> 00:42:48,792
So come to me my love
and let's unite.

766
00:42:48,958 --> 00:42:51,792
He too dazzles with
the Silambam..

767
00:42:52,042 --> 00:42:54,792
looks like he too is
an expert in love

768
00:42:55,083 --> 00:42:57,833
He too dazzles with
the Silambam..

769
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,875
looks like he too is
an expert in love

770
00:43:37,667 --> 00:43:40,708
You are the sweet little bird...

771
00:43:43,542 --> 00:43:46,833
who stole my heart
and flew away.

772
00:43:49,667 --> 00:43:53,042
I am so lucky to have
someone like you...

773
00:43:55,792 --> 00:43:59,000
it's like I've been blessed
and gifted in this birth.

774
00:44:01,958 --> 00:44:07,875
Your looks speaks to me louder than
you and it wants me to love you.

775
00:44:08,042 --> 00:44:13,917
Even the nature seems to be in our
favor as the season around tempts us.

776
00:44:14,167 --> 00:44:20,250
Looks like our love will lead us the way
as all the bad luck too turns into good.

777
00:44:20,292 --> 00:44:26,000
So come to me my love
and let's unite.

778
00:44:26,292 --> 00:44:32,083
So come to me my love
and let's unite.

779
00:44:32,375 --> 00:44:35,042
Dazzles with the Silambam..

780
00:44:35,208 --> 00:44:38,125
you also seem to be
an expert in love.

781
00:44:38,333 --> 00:44:44,333
There is something about
you that mesmerizes me.

782
00:44:44,375 --> 00:44:50,375
This is a new kind of
experience and I am loving it.

783
00:44:50,542 --> 00:44:56,958
So come to me my love
and let's unite.

784
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:02,458
So come to me my love
and let's unite.

785
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:05,500
She dazzles with the Silambam...

786
00:45:05,792 --> 00:45:08,625
looks like she is also
an expert in love

787
00:45:08,625 --> 00:45:11,708
She dazzles with the Silambam...

788
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:14,583
looks like she is also
an expert in love

789
00:45:31,292 --> 00:45:32,042
Muthuramalingam.

790
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:34,375
Come here.

791
00:45:35,625 --> 00:45:36,250
Come on.

792
00:45:40,625 --> 00:45:44,292
Listen, no one must participate in the Silambam
competition to be held in Tirunelveli.

793
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:46,792
Because everyone who
participates in it are crazy.

794
00:45:46,833 --> 00:45:48,333
The don't play fair.

795
00:45:48,333 --> 00:45:50,125
They deny to accept
defeat even after losing.

796
00:45:50,125 --> 00:45:51,583
So no one from us must participates.

797
00:45:51,583 --> 00:45:52,042
Got it?

798
00:45:54,542 --> 00:45:55,542
Now, what was that?

799
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:59,375
Only if we win this tournament we'll be able to
progress to district and state competitions.

800
00:45:59,375 --> 00:46:00,625
But he ordered us
not to participate.

801
00:46:00,625 --> 00:46:01,958
That's his decision.

802
00:46:02,208 --> 00:46:03,917
But we'll participate
and win it.

803
00:46:04,208 --> 00:46:06,167
We'll return with the winners trophy.
Come on.

804
00:46:07,375 --> 00:46:10,125
Nachiya, why are you and
your son struggling?

805
00:46:10,167 --> 00:46:14,000
Get your son Murugan married and his
wife will help you in doing such chores.

806
00:46:14,042 --> 00:46:16,667
See you get it but my mom doesn't.

807
00:46:17,208 --> 00:46:19,125
Men don't have to
work round the clock.

808
00:46:19,167 --> 00:46:21,250
That's not the case with us women.

809
00:46:21,292 --> 00:46:22,875
So better you better leave
and mind your business.

810
00:46:22,917 --> 00:46:23,375
Come on now.

811
00:46:23,375 --> 00:46:24,833
Keep taunting me like this.

812
00:46:24,833 --> 00:46:26,333
Look at him yearning
to get married.

813
00:46:26,583 --> 00:46:27,208
When did she arrive?

814
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:28,458
Hand it to me dear
mother in law.

815
00:46:28,458 --> 00:46:30,250
- I'll take care of it.
- Leave it dear.

816
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:34,292
What's wrong with
what that man said?

817
00:46:34,375 --> 00:46:36,625
Your elder son is old enough now.

818
00:46:36,667 --> 00:46:38,042
It's time for him to get married.

819
00:46:38,083 --> 00:46:41,000
Right from childhood I bought
them up with intense care.

820
00:46:42,042 --> 00:46:44,500
Yep do that but forget
about our marriage.

821
00:46:45,875 --> 00:46:48,833
I've never been away from them.

822
00:46:49,042 --> 00:46:51,417
I cannot live without them.

823
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:55,583
What if the girl he marries separates
us and go live somewhere else?

824
00:46:56,167 --> 00:46:59,167
Come on bringing them up
alone isn't your duty.

825
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:01,875
Are you going to let him be
like this until he grows old.

826
00:47:02,042 --> 00:47:05,500
If every mother in law judges her
daughter in law like you do...

827
00:47:05,542 --> 00:47:07,625
then no girl will
ever get married.

828
00:47:09,042 --> 00:47:14,000
Your advice sounds to me like mother of none is
advising a mother of many about having kids.

829
00:47:14,458 --> 00:47:19,125
Well, I am ready to mother many. So first get your elder
married and make way for me to marry your next son.

830
00:47:19,417 --> 00:47:21,042
We have been looking
for alliances.

831
00:47:21,125 --> 00:47:22,833
I would prefer someone like you.

832
00:47:22,875 --> 00:47:25,375
My elder sister would be a
good match for you elder son.

833
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:26,667
Come down to my home.

834
00:47:26,833 --> 00:47:28,542
If they both like each
other get them married.

835
00:47:28,542 --> 00:47:29,875
I like the sound of it.

836
00:47:30,125 --> 00:47:33,042
But your dad and my husband
must comply with this idea.

837
00:47:33,208 --> 00:47:36,208
Nothing can be got without a
little struggle. No pain, no gain.

838
00:47:36,792 --> 00:47:38,417
It would be nice if it happens.

839
00:47:41,292 --> 00:47:42,583
To Elanji! Elanji!

840
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:45,625
Better to get rid of it
from where I took it.

841
00:47:46,542 --> 00:47:50,000
What's with this utensil Singam Puli?
You seemed to be hooked to it?

842
00:47:50,125 --> 00:47:52,833
Have I ever questioned you about
you being hooked to that bag?

843
00:47:52,875 --> 00:47:54,917
I could have better had a
conversation with her.

844
00:47:54,958 --> 00:47:56,958
Yeah right! I'll let my
husband know about this.

845
00:47:57,458 --> 00:47:59,417
Get in. Get in!

846
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:00,250
Quick!

847
00:48:01,708 --> 00:48:04,167
To Elanji! To Coutallam!

848
00:48:04,292 --> 00:48:05,958
Phew! Escape!

849
00:48:07,583 --> 00:48:08,583
One tea please.

850
00:48:08,667 --> 00:48:10,208
Thanks to the almighty.

851
00:48:10,958 --> 00:48:12,875
So what's the hot news?

852
00:48:12,875 --> 00:48:13,708
Singam Puli!

853
00:48:14,958 --> 00:48:16,375
You'll get on in the bus...

854
00:48:16,458 --> 00:48:18,583
then you'll forget your stuff.

855
00:48:18,708 --> 00:48:20,792
Then later you'll complaint to
the cops that you missed it.

856
00:48:20,875 --> 00:48:23,292
And you'll hold the bus
conductor responsible for it.

857
00:48:23,417 --> 00:48:25,875
Then I'll have to run
around fighting the case.

858
00:48:26,708 --> 00:48:27,250
Take it!

859
00:48:28,042 --> 00:48:29,042
I'll finish you off!

860
00:48:29,875 --> 00:48:30,625
Did you see that?

861
00:48:30,625 --> 00:48:31,708
Your bad luck.

862
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:35,333
Just like the possessed spirit
that won't go away easily...

863
00:48:35,958 --> 00:48:39,750
I wonder what this severed
head is going to do to me.

864
00:48:41,458 --> 00:48:45,417
It's good to meet you all after a long
time and that too in such an occasion.

865
00:48:45,542 --> 00:48:47,958
Thank my younger
daughter Vijaylakshmi.

866
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,167
So I hope there is a feast
after the engagement.

867
00:48:50,208 --> 00:48:52,833
Yes but since it's an auspicious occasion
the feast is going to be vegetarian.

868
00:48:52,875 --> 00:48:56,458
Come on now. Does that mean it will
be the same for the marriage too?

869
00:48:56,458 --> 00:48:57,792
Shut up!

870
00:48:57,833 --> 00:49:00,208
- Did you see that?
- Oh come on. Don't scold him.

871
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:02,083
We all are a family now.

872
00:49:02,083 --> 00:49:03,250
Hands off. That's my wife.

873
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:05,625
Yes right and with that comes
affection and arguments.

874
00:49:05,708 --> 00:49:07,875
Ask the bride to come out.

875
00:49:07,875 --> 00:49:10,667
He seems to be focused.

876
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:12,375
Please ask the bride to come out.

877
00:49:12,667 --> 00:49:14,375
What are you waiting for?

878
00:49:14,417 --> 00:49:17,083
Come on let's head
to the dining area.

879
00:49:29,958 --> 00:49:30,875
Greetings to one and all.

880
00:49:30,875 --> 00:49:32,458
Dear, that is the
groom over there.

881
00:49:35,375 --> 00:49:36,875
This is my sister.

882
00:49:36,917 --> 00:49:37,917
Come on. Don't be shy.

883
00:49:42,042 --> 00:49:45,167
So I guess everything is set. Let's fix
the marriage and carry out the customs.

884
00:49:48,875 --> 00:49:50,542
Bro!Control yourself!

885
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:52,083
Calm down.

886
00:49:52,458 --> 00:49:53,250
Groom looks smart.

887
00:49:53,250 --> 00:49:54,667
Viji, let me take a selfie.

888
00:49:57,625 --> 00:49:58,583
Me too.

889
00:50:00,958 --> 00:50:01,750
Shenbagam.

890
00:50:21,083 --> 00:50:21,625
What?

891
00:50:22,667 --> 00:50:24,833
I don't usually
fall for any girl.

892
00:50:25,667 --> 00:50:27,500
I've no idea how I fell for you.

893
00:50:28,083 --> 00:50:31,333
A beautiful heart can
tame the wildest lion.

894
00:50:33,292 --> 00:50:33,917
Viji.

895
00:50:34,875 --> 00:50:36,208
Can you lie down?

896
00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:37,250
How dare you?

897
00:50:38,125 --> 00:50:39,542
I am excited right now.

898
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:41,125
So?

899
00:50:41,333 --> 00:50:42,250
You lie down.

900
00:50:42,750 --> 00:50:43,542
I'll turn you over.

901
00:50:44,125 --> 00:50:46,708
Or else I'll keep regretting
losing to you in this game.

902
00:50:46,875 --> 00:50:47,667
Get lost.

903
00:50:47,708 --> 00:50:48,375
Now lie down!

904
00:50:51,458 --> 00:50:53,458
Ok! Let me see your guts.
Try turning me over.

905
00:51:14,708 --> 00:51:15,208
Uncle.

906
00:51:15,417 --> 00:51:17,833
Why do you stink?
Didn't you have a bath?

907
00:51:19,042 --> 00:51:20,542
Why are you planning to
buy me scented soaps?

908
00:51:20,542 --> 00:51:21,833
Hey! Hey!

909
00:51:22,125 --> 00:51:26,167
Uncle, there is a couple romancing
in the bedroom upstairs.

910
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:27,083
Go check it out.

911
00:51:27,083 --> 00:51:28,375
Is it? In the bedroom upstairs?

912
00:51:28,375 --> 00:51:31,042
- Yes.
- Quick. Don't miss it.

913
00:51:31,083 --> 00:51:32,000
How can I miss it?

914
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,417
That is all I like to do.

915
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:36,708
What are you waiting for?

916
00:51:36,708 --> 00:51:37,500
Come on. Turn me over!

917
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:38,125
Wait!

918
00:51:41,083 --> 00:51:41,792
Woah!

919
00:51:43,167 --> 00:51:45,250
What's going on?

920
00:51:45,833 --> 00:51:47,292
Engagement is
happening downstairs.

921
00:51:47,333 --> 00:51:49,167
and upstairs the games
have already begun.

922
00:51:49,167 --> 00:51:50,375
Nothing like that.

923
00:51:50,458 --> 00:51:51,542
Remember that game?

924
00:51:51,875 --> 00:51:53,333
But doesn't look like that game!

925
00:51:53,417 --> 00:51:55,208
Not it's not like
what you think.

926
00:51:55,917 --> 00:51:58,250
Stop playing pranks with me.

927
00:51:58,417 --> 00:52:01,125
Wait, let me go down
and inform everyone.

928
00:52:01,167 --> 00:52:02,292
Wait! Wait!

929
00:52:02,333 --> 00:52:03,458
What is it?

930
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:05,708
You take me along everywhere but
left me now while coming here.

931
00:52:05,708 --> 00:52:08,167
Wait and watch
what I'm gonna do.

932
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:13,333
Wait and watch! Wait and watch!

933
00:52:14,833 --> 00:52:16,667
Open your mouth and...

934
00:52:16,667 --> 00:52:17,667
I'll break open it.

935
00:52:17,708 --> 00:52:18,208
No I won't.

936
00:52:18,208 --> 00:52:21,125
Dear, throw away that utensil!

937
00:52:21,125 --> 00:52:23,042
Shut up! Idiot!

938
00:52:23,042 --> 00:52:25,125
So tell me. What
there inside it?

939
00:52:25,167 --> 00:52:25,667
Inside it?

940
00:52:25,792 --> 00:52:28,583
Look I won't open my mouth
about what I saw upstairs.

941
00:52:28,667 --> 00:52:30,875
Nor will I open my mouth
about what's inside this.

942
00:52:30,917 --> 00:52:32,083
See you. See you!

943
00:52:32,125 --> 00:52:34,583
Now move! Stop complaining
to others about the utensil!

944
00:52:49,958 --> 00:52:55,042
Only when I refuse to be the head of the Union
of Truck owners, there should be a new one.

945
00:52:55,208 --> 00:52:58,833
Until then I'll be the
permanent head of the union!

946
00:52:58,958 --> 00:53:00,208
Please don't harm me.

947
00:53:00,292 --> 00:53:01,458
I promise not to oppose you.

948
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:02,250
Let me go.

949
00:53:02,375 --> 00:53:05,542
Only those who don't
fear death can face me!

950
00:53:05,917 --> 00:53:06,500
Go!

951
00:53:07,167 --> 00:53:08,083
Run for you life!

952
00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:11,875
Why did you let him go?

953
00:53:12,667 --> 00:53:15,167
I let him run so
that I can hunt!

954
00:53:15,375 --> 00:53:19,625
No one must find out that
we finished him off.

955
00:53:19,708 --> 00:53:21,167
- Ramiah.
- Yes dad.

956
00:53:21,208 --> 00:53:22,625
Did you hear the news?

957
00:53:22,833 --> 00:53:26,833
Players from Ilanji are going to
participate in the tournament.

958
00:53:26,833 --> 00:53:29,208
They must not participate
in this tournament.

959
00:53:30,167 --> 00:53:32,792
My mustache is enough to scare
them away in the competition.

960
00:53:32,792 --> 00:53:34,125
We'll pin them down!

961
00:53:34,125 --> 00:53:35,208
The trophy is ours!

962
00:56:30,208 --> 00:56:33,875
So none of you obeyed my words and went
ahead to participate in that tournament?

963
00:56:35,333 --> 00:56:37,625
Is that trophy what matters
the most to you all?

964
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,125
What answer will I give to your parents
if something happens to you all?

965
00:56:43,208 --> 00:56:47,375
Your mother, Velnachiyya, considers you,
Muthuramalingam as apple of her eye.

966
00:56:47,667 --> 00:56:49,375
How will I face her?

967
00:56:51,292 --> 00:56:52,125
Look here.

968
00:56:52,375 --> 00:56:54,500
Let this be the first
and last time.

969
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:57,458
Here after I'll decide where, when and
against whom you guys must compete.

970
00:56:57,458 --> 00:56:58,042
Am I clear?

971
00:57:00,792 --> 00:57:01,417
Fine.

972
00:57:01,542 --> 00:57:02,917
I hope none of you are hurt.

973
00:57:05,583 --> 00:57:07,042
Why are you all quiet?

974
00:57:07,958 --> 00:57:08,875
Tell me!

975
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:10,167
What happened?

976
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:11,000
Dad...

977
00:57:11,833 --> 00:57:13,458
I stabbed 7 - 8 men.

978
00:57:13,667 --> 00:57:14,500
You stabbed them?

979
00:57:19,667 --> 00:57:20,500
Look here.

980
00:57:20,750 --> 00:57:23,375
Real men will come back and avenge
face to face after getting stabbed.

981
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:25,167
Cowards will go to the police.

982
00:57:25,292 --> 00:57:28,208
Let me go meet our region's MLA
and try to handle the problem.

983
00:57:28,250 --> 00:57:31,833
Until then go hide somewhere.

984
00:57:34,083 --> 00:57:35,667
What are you waiting for? Go!

985
00:57:43,042 --> 00:57:45,417
I must the first person to bury a head.

986
00:57:45,667 --> 00:57:48,000
6 feet hole for the whole body...

987
00:57:48,083 --> 00:57:50,000
so the head I guess 1
feet will be enough.

988
00:57:51,708 --> 00:57:55,583
What if dogs sniff it
out and get me caught?

989
00:57:55,875 --> 00:57:58,833
I better dig a 6 feet
hole and bury it deep...

990
00:57:59,083 --> 00:58:02,250
then even the CBI won't trace out.

991
00:58:05,208 --> 00:58:07,500
Looks like digging 6 feet
hole will take forever.

992
00:58:08,333 --> 00:58:10,458
I swear I'll never steal
again in my life.

993
00:58:22,292 --> 00:58:23,375
Stop trembling!

994
00:58:23,375 --> 00:58:26,250
The incident of how I got murder
is something worth trembling!

995
00:58:26,292 --> 00:58:26,750
Really?

996
00:58:26,750 --> 00:58:30,083
My wife and her boy friend Singamuthu...

997
00:58:30,208 --> 00:58:33,417
beheaded me while I was
laughing out loud.

998
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:34,167
Oh my god!

999
00:58:34,375 --> 00:58:37,375
Now, my body remains at the
hospital as the head is with you.

1000
00:58:38,667 --> 00:58:41,292
You have been struggling
with my head for a week now.

1001
00:58:41,417 --> 00:58:42,250
Thank you very much.

1002
00:58:42,458 --> 00:58:45,042
Are you a ghost?

1003
00:58:45,125 --> 00:58:46,208
Do I look like your granny?

1004
00:58:47,417 --> 00:58:51,583
If it weren't for you then by now my complete
body's postmortem would've been over.

1005
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,667
Thanks to you I am a spirit now.

1006
00:58:53,792 --> 00:58:55,000
I am going to avenge my death.

1007
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,875
Do you need my help?

1008
00:58:56,958 --> 00:58:57,958
No thanks and shut up!

1009
00:58:58,667 --> 00:59:01,500
Only director James
Wan helps the ghost.

1010
00:59:01,583 --> 00:59:02,125
Indeed.

1011
00:59:02,167 --> 00:59:05,833
I'm plan to act in his movie, become famous
and will earn the title of 'Ghost' star.

1012
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:06,667
Ok.

1013
00:59:07,083 --> 00:59:11,667
You say you wanna be a star.
Do you know to sing and dance?

1014
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:13,375
Nope. I bad at both.

1015
00:59:13,458 --> 00:59:14,125
Don't worry.

1016
00:59:14,292 --> 00:59:15,417
I'll teach you.

1017
00:59:15,458 --> 00:59:19,417
Ready...1...2...3....4!

1018
00:59:20,333 --> 00:59:23,375
(Song from the Tamil
horror movie 'Kanchana 2')

1019
01:00:10,417 --> 01:00:11,167
Mookiah!

1020
01:00:18,333 --> 01:00:19,000
Greetings.

1021
01:00:19,917 --> 01:00:21,708
Isn't Muthuramalingam your son?

1022
01:00:22,708 --> 01:00:27,125
Everyone around this region knows that
Muthuramalingam is a brave heart.

1023
01:00:27,375 --> 01:00:28,583
He is indeed my son.

1024
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:29,542
What is it?

1025
01:00:29,750 --> 01:00:32,333
Stop acting like you
don't know anything.

1026
01:00:32,542 --> 01:00:37,333
Your son and the guys who went along with him
to Tirunelveli had a tussle with men over there.

1027
01:00:37,417 --> 01:00:41,708
Those who got stabbed are
in critical condition.

1028
01:00:41,917 --> 01:00:43,542
Is your son a rogue
to behave so?

1029
01:00:43,750 --> 01:00:45,833
Ask him and the other
guys to come out.

1030
01:00:48,333 --> 01:00:49,083
He won't come.

1031
01:00:49,167 --> 01:00:52,542
If they surrender they
can avoid a thrashing.

1032
01:00:52,625 --> 01:00:53,375
Or else...

1033
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:55,875
I'll finish each of
them in an Encounter!

1034
01:00:56,958 --> 01:01:01,625
Even to fire the gun as a warning in a
riot, you need IAS officer's approval.

1035
01:01:01,625 --> 01:01:04,125
And you talk like an Encounter
is a walk in the park?

1036
01:01:04,167 --> 01:01:05,792
Don't you know about my boys?

1037
01:01:05,833 --> 01:01:07,875
All of them are relatives
and carry my family blood.

1038
01:01:07,875 --> 01:01:09,750
There are 2000 families in this village.

1039
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:10,792
And all of them are related.

1040
01:01:10,792 --> 01:01:12,875
Each family lives in
separate houses but...

1041
01:01:12,958 --> 01:01:15,042
the bond in between among
us is very strong.

1042
01:01:15,167 --> 01:01:19,500
You may leave Inspector sir. I'll come down to
the police station with my son and the boys.

1043
01:01:20,333 --> 01:01:23,042
I don't have to obey you.
You aren't my master!

1044
01:01:23,458 --> 01:01:25,375
Where are the boys?
Ask them to come out!

1045
01:01:26,125 --> 01:01:26,792
Or else...

1046
01:01:26,792 --> 01:01:28,500
I'll drag you down to
the police station.

1047
01:01:30,167 --> 01:01:31,000
Stop staring at me!

1048
01:01:31,833 --> 01:01:34,667
Having a big mustache doesn't make
you a warrior like Kattabomman!

1049
01:01:36,583 --> 01:01:37,667
Mind you!

1050
01:01:55,042 --> 01:01:56,292
Thrash him down!

1051
01:02:52,417 --> 01:02:52,875
Catch him!

1052
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:06,417
How dare you raise your
hands on the police!

1053
01:03:14,792 --> 01:03:18,375
Muthuramalingam, the police is dragging
down your dad by his mustache.

1054
01:03:42,583 --> 01:03:44,292
How dare you touch
my dad's mustache!

1055
01:03:44,292 --> 01:03:45,292
Run! Get lost!

1056
01:03:46,750 --> 01:03:48,625
Don't you dare come back here!

1057
01:03:50,042 --> 01:03:51,708
Dad, are you alright?

1058
01:03:51,750 --> 01:03:53,708
Nothing will happen to
me when you are here!

1059
01:03:54,667 --> 01:03:57,583
Look here! A man must
showcase his Valor!

1060
01:03:58,125 --> 01:04:00,167
Mustache is a symbol of Valor!

1061
01:04:00,625 --> 01:04:02,000
The mane is the Valor of a lion!

1062
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,083
Trunk is the Valor of an elephant!

1063
01:04:03,083 --> 01:04:04,083
Venom is the Valor of a snake!

1064
01:04:04,083 --> 01:04:05,417
Vision is the Valor of an eagle!

1065
01:04:05,417 --> 01:04:06,958
And for my father it's his mustache.

1066
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:10,625
It's his mustache that made
my mom fall in love with him.

1067
01:04:11,125 --> 01:04:14,333
Even the god's we worship have
mustache or else it ain't our deity.

1068
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Leaders who fought for
our independence,

1069
01:04:17,042 --> 01:04:19,958
Veerapandian Kattamboman, Veera
Sundaralingar, Veera Azhagumugthu Kone,

1070
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:23,667
Veera Marudhupandian and Maveeran Pulidevan,
every one fought sporting a mustache!

1071
01:04:24,083 --> 01:04:27,375
Even great Bharathi fought sporting a
mustache to chase away the foreigners!

1072
01:04:27,542 --> 01:04:31,708
You disrespected our mustache sentiment
and that is why I chopped off your hands!

1073
01:04:33,042 --> 01:04:36,292
If I can chop your hands then chopping
off your head isn't a big deal for me!

1074
01:04:36,833 --> 01:04:43,042
I chopped off your hand so that no one in future
disrespects the Mustache sentiment of the Tamilians!

1075
01:04:44,833 --> 01:04:45,375
Now get lost!

1076
01:04:46,833 --> 01:04:48,375
Go let the word know about it!

1077
01:04:50,042 --> 01:04:51,667
- Run!
- Run!

1078
01:04:54,583 --> 01:04:55,583
Bravo!

1079
01:04:56,125 --> 01:04:57,167
Now this is real Valor!

1080
01:04:57,417 --> 01:04:59,708
When a dog barks all the
other dogs start to bark!

1081
01:05:00,375 --> 01:05:03,792
Now every time a police
disrespects our sentiment...

1082
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,792
they must realize
what will happen!

1083
01:05:07,125 --> 01:05:09,875
Let's hang his hand out there
where every one can see it! Come on!

1084
01:05:26,458 --> 01:05:28,917
Muthuramalingam has chopped
off the hand of a police!

1085
01:05:29,167 --> 01:05:30,958
Don't take that lightly!

1086
01:05:30,958 --> 01:05:34,000
No matter where we go,
our baggage follows us.

1087
01:05:34,333 --> 01:05:36,792
Similarly the police
will follow us!

1088
01:05:36,875 --> 01:05:38,500
I ain't afraid of the police.

1089
01:05:38,542 --> 01:05:40,375
But we must respect the law!

1090
01:05:40,625 --> 01:05:43,000
They won't face off with us.

1091
01:05:43,208 --> 01:05:45,958
So before the police comes down...

1092
01:05:46,292 --> 01:05:50,875
I want my family and the family of the 15 guys who went with
my son to Tirunelveli, to leave this village immediately.

1093
01:05:50,958 --> 01:05:53,958
All the men in the remaining families
leave to out of station for few days.

1094
01:05:53,958 --> 01:05:56,958
Or else the police may arrest
you in charges of assault!

1095
01:05:57,250 --> 01:06:00,042
You'll only have time for attending
court sessions and cases.

1096
01:06:00,917 --> 01:06:01,958
Just for few days.

1097
01:06:02,708 --> 01:06:04,167
Meanwhile I'll
consult an advocate.

1098
01:06:04,375 --> 01:06:06,542
Don't worry about the expenses.
I'll take care of it!

1099
01:06:06,708 --> 01:06:07,833
So don't be afraid. Leave!

1100
01:06:07,875 --> 01:06:08,625
Leave!

1101
01:06:48,792 --> 01:06:50,958
A police man's hand
has been chopped!

1102
01:06:51,333 --> 01:06:53,250
So bring the full police
force or what ever required!

1103
01:06:53,250 --> 01:06:55,167
Spare none of them
in that village!

1104
01:06:55,417 --> 01:06:56,292
Arrest everyone!

1105
01:06:56,625 --> 01:06:58,250
Sir, it ain't that easy!

1106
01:06:58,583 --> 01:07:00,208
Those village people
are very dangerous.

1107
01:07:00,208 --> 01:07:01,958
Yes sir. They are
fearless people.

1108
01:07:02,083 --> 01:07:04,292
We'll have to cross 10 villages
before reaching Ilanji.

1109
01:07:04,458 --> 01:07:06,833
The blocked the path
with stones and logs.

1110
01:07:06,958 --> 01:07:09,625
If we still go, there are
chances many of us might die.

1111
01:07:09,958 --> 01:07:11,875
We too have a family
and we can't risk our lives.

1112
01:07:15,958 --> 01:07:17,417
Greetings sir.

1113
01:07:18,625 --> 01:07:19,250
Ok sir.

1114
01:07:19,958 --> 01:07:20,625
Sir who?

1115
01:07:22,083 --> 01:07:23,208
Yes sir, very good choice.

1116
01:07:23,417 --> 01:07:24,417
Depute him immediately.

1117
01:07:24,417 --> 01:07:25,000
Thanks sir.

1118
01:07:26,333 --> 01:07:27,750
So you guys won't go! Right?

1119
01:07:27,875 --> 01:07:30,583
IPS officer Ashok
Pandian is on his way!

1120
01:08:03,333 --> 01:08:04,167
Remove the hand.

1121
01:08:04,208 --> 01:08:04,833
Yes sir!

1122
01:08:11,625 --> 01:08:13,458
Greetings sir.

1123
01:08:13,542 --> 01:08:15,042
I'm the Village
Administrator here.

1124
01:08:15,542 --> 01:08:17,750
Is this really a village
or a wild forest?

1125
01:08:18,583 --> 01:08:21,292
Arrest every men at sight.

1126
01:08:21,708 --> 01:08:26,708
Muthuramalingam, who chopped the police officer's hand,
his dad Mookiah Devar and his family have absconded.

1127
01:08:26,750 --> 01:08:31,750
The families of the other 15
boys have also absconded.

1128
01:08:31,875 --> 01:08:32,875
Apart from that...

1129
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:36,458
all the men in this village too
have absconded to avoid the police.

1130
01:08:36,583 --> 01:08:38,583
Bomabrd the houses
of all the 15 guys!

1131
01:08:38,625 --> 01:08:41,833
Inform me at once if you get any
news about anyone who has absconded.

1132
01:08:52,833 --> 01:08:53,833
Where's my uncle?

1133
01:08:53,917 --> 01:08:54,750
Come with me.

1134
01:08:58,583 --> 01:08:59,417
Greetings uncle.

1135
01:09:00,125 --> 01:09:01,958
Dear Nephew! Welcome
dear advocate!

1136
01:09:02,458 --> 01:09:03,250
What is it?

1137
01:09:04,417 --> 01:09:06,875
Are you here to convince us
to surrender to the police?

1138
01:09:07,250 --> 01:09:08,458
We won't surrender!

1139
01:09:08,875 --> 01:09:10,167
I'm not here for that.

1140
01:09:10,333 --> 01:09:12,292
I had been to your village
for an important work.

1141
01:09:12,292 --> 01:09:14,333
The police has rounded
up your house.

1142
01:09:14,542 --> 01:09:16,000
You don't worry.

1143
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:19,125
30 - 40 of our men are the
advocates and judges in the court.

1144
01:09:19,292 --> 01:09:22,083
We'll go to the supreme court if required.
We will win the case.

1145
01:09:22,208 --> 01:09:24,167
Also, there was a
courier for you.

1146
01:09:24,375 --> 01:09:25,000
Here.

1147
01:09:29,125 --> 01:09:29,583
Fine.

1148
01:09:29,667 --> 01:09:30,875
Fine. I'll leave now.

1149
01:09:30,875 --> 01:09:31,458
Ok. Fine.

1150
01:09:49,875 --> 01:09:50,958
Mookiah...

1151
01:09:51,292 --> 01:09:52,792
are you stranded?

1152
01:09:53,167 --> 01:09:55,833
Now let me add on to your woes.

1153
01:09:59,125 --> 01:10:01,500
Out of the 3 children you
have fathered so dearly...

1154
01:10:38,333 --> 01:10:41,458
So tell me! Any information
on the accused ones?

1155
01:10:41,708 --> 01:10:42,875
I inquired everyone around.

1156
01:10:42,958 --> 01:10:47,167
The women here are hard to break.
They aren't revealing anything.

1157
01:10:47,792 --> 01:10:50,208
Criminals will never be
within our eye sight.

1158
01:10:50,333 --> 01:10:51,917
They will always
hide like cowards.

1159
01:10:53,958 --> 01:10:54,958
Greetings sir.

1160
01:10:55,208 --> 01:10:58,500
11 youths from this village are 12th
grade students in a school in Thenkasi.

1161
01:10:58,625 --> 01:11:01,625
10 of them are studying
in the government school.

1162
01:11:02,042 --> 01:11:03,625
Mookiah Devar's daughter alone...

1163
01:11:03,750 --> 01:11:08,792
studies at the Sri Venkateseswara
matriculation school in Thenkasi.

1164
01:11:08,875 --> 01:11:12,250
Today the hall tickets for the
public exams are being issued.

1165
01:11:12,292 --> 01:11:14,917
You can arrest her if you go there.

1166
01:11:15,042 --> 01:11:16,958
Later, that will lead
others to surrender.

1167
01:11:19,250 --> 01:11:20,250
It's a good idea.

1168
01:11:20,417 --> 01:11:21,625
Sir, there is one
new information.

1169
01:11:21,625 --> 01:11:23,542
A special officer from
this area is on his way.

1170
01:11:23,542 --> 01:11:25,125
Sir, he ain't like any other.

1171
01:11:25,125 --> 01:11:29,208
He is the master mind behind
nabbing many top criminals.

1172
01:11:29,292 --> 01:11:34,625
He was personally well treated and awarded the doctorate at Brunei
university by the Brunei king as an appreciation of his master mind.

1173
01:11:34,625 --> 01:11:37,708
He is the only Indian
police to have a doctorate.

1174
01:11:37,792 --> 01:11:39,792
He is Dr. Rajasekar Kalakeyan.

1175
01:11:39,875 --> 01:11:41,500
His foot steps have
already landed here.

1176
01:12:05,042 --> 01:12:07,167
What's with the
muzzle grasp act?

1177
01:12:07,250 --> 01:12:09,917
That is what happens when
you make me run like a dog!

1178
01:12:11,125 --> 01:12:14,750
The horse seems to be tired. Come on
let's take it and feed some water.

1179
01:12:14,750 --> 01:12:17,542
A racing horse never
gets thirsty!

1180
01:12:18,125 --> 01:12:19,250
Don't get started!

1181
01:12:19,250 --> 01:12:22,583
Muthuramalingam chopped of
a police officer's hand.

1182
01:12:22,625 --> 01:12:25,625
Now you are here to catch him.
Aren't you afraid?

1183
01:12:27,292 --> 01:12:30,500
A gas station owner will
never fear the fire!

1184
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:34,125
A mouse has meaning to it's
life where the cat lives.

1185
01:12:34,167 --> 01:12:35,833
But then why are you
playing the mouse?

1186
01:12:35,875 --> 01:12:37,625
Shut up or else I'll
Encounter you!

1187
01:12:41,042 --> 01:12:44,542
Look! An educated fellow and
that too in this village!

1188
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,458
Nothing can go wrong.

1189
01:12:46,583 --> 01:12:51,167
20 years ago, in the movie 'Devar Magan', Kamal
Hassan had advised youngsters to get educated

1190
01:12:51,292 --> 01:12:52,708
Looks like he took it seriously!

1191
01:12:52,750 --> 01:12:53,500
No Kaval!

1192
01:12:53,625 --> 01:12:56,292
He took it 'too' seriously!

1193
01:12:56,542 --> 01:12:57,208
Hey you!

1194
01:12:59,667 --> 01:13:00,583
- Kaval!
- Sir?

1195
01:13:00,625 --> 01:13:02,958
Look at his manners. Proves
that he is educated.

1196
01:13:03,083 --> 01:13:03,708
Indeed sir.

1197
01:13:03,875 --> 01:13:06,458
So tell me. What
have you studied?

1198
01:13:06,458 --> 01:13:08,542
The epics Ramayanam and Mahabharatham.

1199
01:13:08,583 --> 01:13:09,708
The Bible and the Quran.

1200
01:13:09,750 --> 01:13:11,292
Arunanoor and the Silapathikaram.

1201
01:13:11,333 --> 01:13:18,750
Manimegalai, Siveli Chinthamani, Valayapathi, Kundalakesi,
Periyapuranam, Devaram, Thiruvasagam and few more. That's it.

1202
01:13:18,875 --> 01:13:22,000
Looks like you are more educated that
the great Solomon Papaiya itself.

1203
01:13:22,042 --> 01:13:23,583
You can actually jury a debate.

1204
01:13:23,792 --> 01:13:25,375
What book were you reading now?

1205
01:13:25,375 --> 01:13:28,417
" Wings of fire" by
Sir APJ Abdul Kalam.

1206
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:32,292
Believe me! You'll grow into a
blazing fire in the future.

1207
01:13:32,542 --> 01:13:34,167
Nothing's wrong with
the village people.

1208
01:13:34,208 --> 01:13:35,708
The fault seems to
be with the police.

1209
01:13:35,708 --> 01:13:38,833
I am sure the most wanted
Muthuramalingam is innocent.

1210
01:13:39,208 --> 01:13:41,208
Bro, I don't want to
disturb your studies.

1211
01:13:41,292 --> 01:13:43,917
At the same time I would like
to take a selfie with you.

1212
01:13:44,458 --> 01:13:45,125
Pardon?

1213
01:13:45,125 --> 01:13:46,500
Can I have a snap with you?

1214
01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:47,208
Yeah sure.

1215
01:13:51,958 --> 01:13:55,083
Also, please give me an autograph.
Please. I would love that.

1216
01:13:55,208 --> 01:13:57,000
It's so nice to meet a
well educated person.

1217
01:13:57,042 --> 01:14:01,583
Similarly if these people can save the farmers then
we can save agriculture from real estate people.

1218
01:14:04,417 --> 01:14:05,125
Here.

1219
01:14:05,125 --> 01:14:06,167
Thanks dear.

1220
01:14:06,250 --> 01:14:07,542
May you live long and prosper.

1221
01:14:07,708 --> 01:14:10,625
Sir, he is reading Kalam sir's book...

1222
01:14:10,667 --> 01:14:11,917
won't you salute him?

1223
01:14:11,917 --> 01:14:12,833
Watch me now!

1224
01:14:12,875 --> 01:14:13,792
Jai Hind!

1225
01:14:15,667 --> 01:14:16,583
See you dear.

1226
01:14:19,958 --> 01:14:21,167
Yes sir!

1227
01:14:24,708 --> 01:14:25,250
Catch it.

1228
01:14:28,917 --> 01:14:29,542
What happened?

1229
01:14:29,667 --> 01:14:31,583
That's the way he eats a candy.

1230
01:14:31,583 --> 01:14:32,125
Shut up!

1231
01:14:32,167 --> 01:14:34,250
Sir, that's my mannerism.

1232
01:14:34,333 --> 01:14:36,042
When I was posted in Andhra...

1233
01:14:36,042 --> 01:14:39,333
my mannerism was noticed and
copied in the movie 'Bahubali'.

1234
01:14:39,542 --> 01:14:40,792
But the original rights...

1235
01:14:41,208 --> 01:14:42,375
is with me.

1236
01:14:42,417 --> 01:14:45,042
I am Dr. Rajasekar
Kalakeyan sir!

1237
01:14:45,583 --> 01:14:46,042
What?

1238
01:14:46,333 --> 01:14:47,583
Kal-el is Kane?

1239
01:14:47,583 --> 01:14:53,167
He is the special officer appointed by the
central government to nab Muthuramalingam.

1240
01:14:53,292 --> 01:14:55,000
Here is the appointment order.

1241
01:14:55,083 --> 01:14:59,417
Sir! I'll dig out Muthuramalingam from
deep under the ground if required.

1242
01:14:59,625 --> 01:15:04,292
If he ain't in land then I'll swim
across the whole ocean to nab him!

1243
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:08,167
I'll nab him down even if he
is in a different planet!

1244
01:15:08,167 --> 01:15:10,500
Now, that's Dr. Rajasekar
Kalakeyan for you!

1245
01:15:10,583 --> 01:15:12,375
Who awarded you Doctorate?

1246
01:15:12,375 --> 01:15:14,042
It was the Brunei
king himself who...

1247
01:15:14,250 --> 01:15:15,750
What is my next operation sir?

1248
01:15:16,292 --> 01:15:17,542
Now at ease!

1249
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,083
Else you might be the one
who'll need an operation.

1250
01:15:20,375 --> 01:15:20,958
Let's go.

1251
01:15:21,042 --> 01:15:23,333
Sir! In that case I'll
come in my vehicle.

1252
01:15:23,333 --> 01:15:24,000
Sir, please no!

1253
01:15:24,042 --> 01:15:26,333
He'll make me run, as
he rides the horse.

1254
01:15:26,458 --> 01:15:27,375
No problem sir!

1255
01:15:27,625 --> 01:15:29,000
Though the horse is there...

1256
01:15:29,125 --> 01:15:31,708
the horse power is here!

1257
01:15:31,708 --> 01:15:32,875
Come on sir!

1258
01:15:41,792 --> 01:15:42,583
No!

1259
01:15:42,667 --> 01:15:43,333
What is it?

1260
01:15:43,792 --> 01:15:44,625
Is it electrocuted?

1261
01:15:44,625 --> 01:15:45,208
No sir.

1262
01:15:45,417 --> 01:15:46,875
The students and
staffs are praying.

1263
01:15:47,167 --> 01:15:50,417
If he go now it'll
disturb the students.

1264
01:15:50,917 --> 01:15:52,583
If we break in...

1265
01:15:52,875 --> 01:15:54,542
they'll break down.

1266
01:15:54,875 --> 01:15:58,708
Students aren't supposed to be
intimidated by the police.

1267
01:15:58,750 --> 01:15:59,833
They must respect police!

1268
01:16:01,583 --> 01:16:02,417
Dear students...

1269
01:16:02,833 --> 01:16:07,042
Your hall tickets for the public exams will
issues to you in your respective classrooms

1270
01:16:07,083 --> 01:16:07,875
You may collect it.

1271
01:16:12,958 --> 01:16:13,792
Excuse me sir.

1272
01:16:14,042 --> 01:16:14,500
Yes?

1273
01:16:15,542 --> 01:16:17,625
Good morning. I'm Ashok Pandian.

1274
01:16:17,708 --> 01:16:18,792
I'm the DSP.

1275
01:16:19,250 --> 01:16:20,458
I hope you must have heard.

1276
01:16:20,708 --> 01:16:23,625
About the charges on your school's
Silambam trainer Muthuramalingam.

1277
01:16:23,667 --> 01:16:24,333
I do know.

1278
01:16:24,750 --> 01:16:26,250
We haven't arrested him yet.

1279
01:16:26,625 --> 01:16:27,708
He remains absconded.

1280
01:16:27,792 --> 01:16:31,125
With your permission I would like to
interrogate his sister Shenbagavalli.

1281
01:16:31,500 --> 01:16:32,083
One second.

1282
01:16:35,333 --> 01:16:35,833
Sir?

1283
01:16:35,958 --> 01:16:37,167
Please come to my office.

1284
01:16:37,208 --> 01:16:37,792
Ok sir.

1285
01:16:40,917 --> 01:16:42,333
- Yes sir.
- Call Shenbagavalli.

1286
01:16:42,375 --> 01:16:43,875
She isn't present at
the school today.

1287
01:16:43,958 --> 01:16:45,417
Not even to receive her hall ticket?

1288
01:16:45,458 --> 01:16:48,292
Just minutes ago her brother
Muthuramalingam came and collected it.

1289
01:16:49,667 --> 01:16:50,292
You may leave.

1290
01:16:50,292 --> 01:16:52,417
Shit! Lock all the gates!

1291
01:16:52,417 --> 01:16:53,625
The accused must not escape.

1292
01:16:53,625 --> 01:16:54,250
Search!

1293
01:16:54,333 --> 01:16:55,833
No one can escape our eyes!

1294
01:16:55,833 --> 01:16:56,458
You are right!

1295
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:58,750
Hey boy!

1296
01:17:00,375 --> 01:17:01,042
Come on!

1297
01:17:03,125 --> 01:17:04,583
Why is he reversing like a car?

1298
01:17:04,583 --> 01:17:05,958
Watch me apply the hand brake!

1299
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:08,500
You again?

1300
01:17:08,583 --> 01:17:10,625
Do you've an elder brother
who reads by the fields?

1301
01:17:10,708 --> 01:17:12,125
That was me.

1302
01:17:12,750 --> 01:17:14,500
You were in casual dress then.

1303
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:15,875
Here you are in uniform.

1304
01:17:15,917 --> 01:17:18,542
I am sure you're talent will
someday make you the DSP!

1305
01:17:18,542 --> 01:17:20,917
But where are you going now?

1306
01:17:21,167 --> 01:17:22,042
To the toilet.

1307
01:17:22,083 --> 01:17:22,792
Toilet?

1308
01:17:22,875 --> 01:17:24,833
Well that's fair.

1309
01:17:24,875 --> 01:17:27,417
So go ahead. Leak as
much as you want.

1310
01:17:27,417 --> 01:17:30,042
You go take a leak and we'll
go nab Muthuramalingam!

1311
01:17:30,083 --> 01:17:30,583
Yes!

1312
01:17:30,583 --> 01:17:31,292
- Kaval.
- Yes sir!

1313
01:17:31,292 --> 01:17:32,583
Continue with the rounds!

1314
01:17:32,583 --> 01:17:33,125
Ok!

1315
01:17:36,583 --> 01:17:38,083
Who let the watchman inside?

1316
01:17:38,167 --> 01:17:39,000
- You!
- Sir!

1317
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:39,792
Yes sir!

1318
01:17:39,792 --> 01:17:41,625
Sir, did you find
Muthuramalingam?

1319
01:17:42,125 --> 01:17:43,750
Did anyone come this side?

1320
01:17:44,333 --> 01:17:44,917
Did you see?

1321
01:17:45,375 --> 01:17:49,583
Sir, we both were guarding really strict.
Even the wind would've not escaped us!

1322
01:17:49,625 --> 01:17:52,292
Then how will a culprit
deceive us and escape?

1323
01:17:52,417 --> 01:17:54,917
A student came by to take a leak.

1324
01:17:54,958 --> 01:17:56,250
I allowed him alone.

1325
01:17:56,250 --> 01:17:57,583
You may go check.

1326
01:17:57,583 --> 01:17:58,250
What nonsense?

1327
01:17:58,250 --> 01:17:58,917
Call him.

1328
01:17:58,917 --> 01:18:00,333
Right now he is attending
to nature's call.

1329
01:18:00,333 --> 01:18:01,500
Go call him!

1330
01:18:01,500 --> 01:18:02,708
- Go!
- Oh! Sorry sir.

1331
01:18:03,250 --> 01:18:04,042
This is the place.

1332
01:18:04,458 --> 01:18:05,958
Go check if he is inside.

1333
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:09,583
Sir, he ain't a water pipe to close
the tap and stop the water flow.

1334
01:18:09,625 --> 01:18:11,083
He'll come out once he is done.

1335
01:18:11,458 --> 01:18:12,500
Irritating fellow!

1336
01:18:13,042 --> 01:18:15,000
He just abused and left!

1337
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:16,500
Why are you silent?

1338
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:17,708
Oh! He is like the
radio station.

1339
01:18:17,708 --> 01:18:18,875
We must listen to him.

1340
01:18:18,917 --> 01:18:20,250
He won't listen to us.

1341
01:18:20,250 --> 01:18:21,500
Now get inside! Check!

1342
01:18:21,542 --> 01:18:23,458
- Stop your gossips!
- Ok sir!

1343
01:18:26,500 --> 01:18:27,125
Student!

1344
01:18:27,583 --> 01:18:28,667
Don't worry.

1345
01:18:28,833 --> 01:18:30,125
Finish what you came here for.

1346
01:18:30,250 --> 01:18:31,583
Make sure you zip up your pants.

1347
01:18:31,583 --> 01:18:33,292
Now be calm and step out.

1348
01:18:33,333 --> 01:18:34,000
Kalakeya!

1349
01:18:34,083 --> 01:18:35,083
Stop being sweet!

1350
01:18:35,083 --> 01:18:36,958
- Get inside and check!
- Not me! You go!

1351
01:18:37,292 --> 01:18:37,875
Sir!

1352
01:18:40,250 --> 01:18:41,833
It's way to open
space for a toilet!

1353
01:18:41,875 --> 01:18:44,167
I can see as far as the
neighboring village from here!

1354
01:18:44,917 --> 01:18:45,417
Shit!

1355
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:46,792
He has escaped!

1356
01:18:47,208 --> 01:18:50,750
Sir, this is the emergency exit
via which students bunk school.

1357
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,542
Please don't make
this a serious issue.

1358
01:18:52,542 --> 01:18:54,083
It's like how we enjoyed
our school days.

1359
01:18:54,083 --> 01:18:57,333
"Student who bunk school grow up to be
great minds" claims Dindugal Leoni.

1360
01:18:57,500 --> 01:18:58,000
Shut up!

1361
01:18:58,042 --> 01:18:59,375
Is this bloody funny to you?

1362
01:19:00,375 --> 01:19:01,792
I see both of you dismissed!

1363
01:19:02,208 --> 01:19:02,792
Idiots!

1364
01:19:04,375 --> 01:19:06,750
He just threatened us and left!

1365
01:19:06,875 --> 01:19:08,875
Why are you silent?

1366
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:13,417
His abuse was a small gas leakage.
It ain't gonna hurt the ocean much!

1367
01:19:17,917 --> 01:19:20,375
Someone has couriered me
this letter to confuse me.

1368
01:19:21,458 --> 01:19:22,875
But I won't get confused.

1369
01:19:23,833 --> 01:19:25,125
I won't believe it!

1370
01:19:25,458 --> 01:19:26,333
I believe you!

1371
01:19:26,750 --> 01:19:29,167
All 3 of them are my children!

1372
01:20:08,375 --> 01:20:09,375
Viji!

1373
01:20:10,083 --> 01:20:12,250
The police is here. Jump!

1374
01:20:12,833 --> 01:20:15,208
Here I come my dear groom!

1375
01:20:55,500 --> 01:20:56,458
Stop!

1376
01:21:36,333 --> 01:21:36,875
Water!

1377
01:21:37,625 --> 01:21:38,292
Water!

1378
01:21:38,958 --> 01:21:39,833
Water!

1379
01:21:49,708 --> 01:21:50,333
Look!

1380
01:21:51,250 --> 01:21:53,958
You were trained for only 6 months
before joining the police force.

1381
01:21:54,125 --> 01:21:56,625
But I've been training
Silambam since the age of 6.

1382
01:21:57,167 --> 01:22:00,208
You can't even chase and outrun
the women of our land...

1383
01:22:00,250 --> 01:22:01,917
then how do you think
you can catch me?

1384
01:22:02,167 --> 01:22:05,000
We are like the lion -
the king of the jungle!

1385
01:22:05,583 --> 01:22:09,458
You would have heard stories about my Valor
and modesty but you haven't seen my wrath!

1386
01:22:10,792 --> 01:22:14,500
I can finish you off
right now, right here!

1387
01:22:15,583 --> 01:22:16,708
But I won't do that!

1388
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,625
Just because you've sport
the mustache of Valor!

1389
01:22:34,250 --> 01:22:37,792
You guys chased him yet
you don't recognize him?

1390
01:22:44,208 --> 01:22:46,083
He chopped off a
police officer's hand!

1391
01:22:46,292 --> 01:22:47,917
He insulted the whole police force!

1392
01:22:47,958 --> 01:22:52,042
None of the police who saw the chopping
incident are ready to come with me!

1393
01:22:52,542 --> 01:22:55,000
I haven't seen him yet!
Not even a photograph!

1394
01:22:56,125 --> 01:22:57,917
Don't you have one?

1395
01:22:57,917 --> 01:22:59,417
- No.
- Are you making me a fool?

1396
01:22:59,958 --> 01:23:02,333
Won't there be even a single
photo at his house? Got get it!

1397
01:23:02,333 --> 01:23:05,333
You burned down his house
the day you came here!

1398
01:23:05,333 --> 01:23:06,375
We won't get any there.

1399
01:23:06,375 --> 01:23:08,292
Not even from the voters list?

1400
01:23:08,333 --> 01:23:09,667
Here is the voters list.

1401
01:23:10,208 --> 01:23:10,833
Here.

1402
01:23:16,250 --> 01:23:17,042
Now who's this?

1403
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:23,667
Not me!

1404
01:23:23,667 --> 01:23:26,417
This is some mistake by
the election commission!

1405
01:23:26,458 --> 01:23:31,000
I have even heard that Vin Diesel photo
was put up in Johnny Depp's voter id!

1406
01:23:31,083 --> 01:23:31,875
Let me tell you more!

1407
01:23:31,875 --> 01:23:33,542
Even one of our men
Mayandi's voter id had...

1408
01:23:33,542 --> 01:23:35,500
the photo of the a...

1409
01:23:36,333 --> 01:23:38,083
minister from the
neighboring state.

1410
01:23:38,125 --> 01:23:42,333
So it's a pure typographical error and
terror of election commission sir!

1411
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:45,500
You!

1412
01:23:46,042 --> 01:23:46,625
Come here!

1413
01:23:51,333 --> 01:23:52,667
How long since you are married?

1414
01:23:52,750 --> 01:23:53,958
It's been 15 days.

1415
01:23:54,667 --> 01:23:55,833
Get me your wedding album.

1416
01:23:57,583 --> 01:23:58,500
Go! Get it!

1417
01:24:01,292 --> 01:24:01,917
Now what?

1418
01:24:02,292 --> 01:24:04,542
Why does he want
the wedding album?

1419
01:24:04,542 --> 01:24:05,333
May be looking for a bride?

1420
01:24:05,333 --> 01:24:07,208
Who cares about that?

1421
01:24:07,375 --> 01:24:09,958
No matter what. Let' stay calm!

1422
01:24:10,083 --> 01:24:11,833
Yeah. Fine. Alright.

1423
01:24:11,833 --> 01:24:12,750
You said something?

1424
01:24:12,875 --> 01:24:14,792
Ganga river flows
in our country!

1425
01:24:17,792 --> 01:24:18,583
Here you go.

1426
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:22,333
Now explain me who
are all in this.

1427
01:24:22,333 --> 01:24:23,708
This are his parents.

1428
01:24:23,792 --> 01:24:24,833
That's his sister.

1429
01:24:25,208 --> 01:24:26,458
Where is Muthuramalingam?

1430
01:24:26,625 --> 01:24:28,292
I think he didn't
attend the wedding.

1431
01:24:31,542 --> 01:24:32,000
Sir...

1432
01:24:32,458 --> 01:24:36,042
Ex MLA Thenarasu's
daughter, Vijaylakshmi...

1433
01:24:36,208 --> 01:24:40,250
and Muthuramalingam are
believed to be in a relation.

1434
01:24:42,333 --> 01:24:45,375
Now wait and watch
how I rat him out!

1435
01:24:49,167 --> 01:24:49,917
Can we meet sir now?

1436
01:24:49,958 --> 01:24:51,958
He is inside...

1437
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:53,750
Not yet. He'll soon be inside!

1438
01:24:54,042 --> 01:24:55,042
Please don't shoot!

1439
01:24:55,083 --> 01:24:55,833
Lower your Dhoti!

1440
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,208
Show some respect to the police!

1441
01:24:59,958 --> 01:25:01,042
Welcome DSP sir.

1442
01:25:01,958 --> 01:25:03,500
I was expecting your arrival.

1443
01:25:04,333 --> 01:25:05,625
Sir, you are a VIP.

1444
01:25:05,708 --> 01:25:07,125
I am saying this
for your safety.

1445
01:25:07,833 --> 01:25:11,167
It's someone from your house, who is
communicating with Muthuramalingam.

1446
01:25:12,250 --> 01:25:14,875
Ask Muthuramalingam to
surrender at the earliest!

1447
01:25:15,375 --> 01:25:16,542
We'll spare his life.

1448
01:25:16,625 --> 01:25:17,667
And if he doesn't...

1449
01:25:18,208 --> 01:25:20,708
then here, I've an order to
Encounter him and shoot him!

1450
01:25:22,167 --> 01:25:24,417
I'll shoot him down for sure!

1451
01:25:48,208 --> 01:25:52,958
Sir, Thenarasu's daughter tried
reaching the number 9003849898.

1452
01:25:53,083 --> 01:25:55,375
Right now the number is not reachable!

1453
01:25:55,917 --> 01:25:58,625
Can you find which area tower signal
had that number recorded last?

1454
01:25:58,667 --> 01:26:01,542
Krishnapuram village,
tower number 2.

1455
01:26:02,083 --> 01:26:02,583
Ok.

1456
01:26:02,625 --> 01:26:04,917
Sir, that girl doesn't
seem to come out yet.

1457
01:26:05,375 --> 01:26:07,208
Wait and watch. She'll come now.

1458
01:26:10,333 --> 01:26:11,500
Sir! There she is!

1459
01:26:12,250 --> 01:26:12,833
Look!

1460
01:26:16,500 --> 01:26:17,958
Boys! Listen to my instruction.

1461
01:26:17,958 --> 01:26:19,375
Yes sir! Come on run!

1462
01:26:19,583 --> 01:26:21,458
What are you doing James?

1463
01:26:21,500 --> 01:26:22,708
Look how Kalakeya
just raced away.

1464
01:26:22,875 --> 01:26:24,167
You guys go follow that girl.

1465
01:26:24,292 --> 01:26:25,708
Go. I'll take another route!

1466
01:26:28,125 --> 01:26:32,208
When started to run I thought you were
about to pull of something special!

1467
01:26:32,250 --> 01:26:34,375
I never expected
that it was to hide!

1468
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:35,583
I feel ashamed!

1469
01:26:35,708 --> 01:26:36,625
Fool!

1470
01:26:36,875 --> 01:26:40,500
It is impossible to pull of anything special
to catch him! He is Muthuramalingam!

1471
01:27:32,458 --> 01:27:35,708
Muthuramalingam knows how to lie
low and also when to pounce!

1472
01:27:36,458 --> 01:27:38,625
The only thing I don't
know about is...Fear!

1473
01:28:05,875 --> 01:28:07,875
Come on! Let's head
back the way we came.

1474
01:28:07,958 --> 01:28:09,125
No Kaval!

1475
01:28:09,500 --> 01:28:12,167
Until now we've been seeing
only Muthuramalingam's back!

1476
01:28:12,458 --> 01:28:14,500
Any minute he'll turn and...

1477
01:28:14,583 --> 01:28:16,667
I am going to register
his face on my mind!

1478
01:28:38,167 --> 01:28:40,250
Look at him go! Those
blows sound real heavy!

1479
01:28:41,917 --> 01:28:44,333
Sir, look a brick is approaching us.

1480
01:28:44,333 --> 01:28:46,125
That is heading somewhere else.
Not here.

1481
01:28:50,417 --> 01:28:52,833
Sir, why are you down
like a hung up mobile?

1482
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:53,583
Join me!

1483
01:28:54,417 --> 01:28:57,958
There is always something
behind my ideas.

1484
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:58,750
What's the idea?

1485
01:28:58,792 --> 01:29:00,833
He'll cross us as he runs away.

1486
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,500
That is when I'll get an glimpse
of his face and register it!

1487
01:29:08,458 --> 01:29:09,750
Did you see his face?

1488
01:29:09,875 --> 01:29:14,208
The way he crossed me, I saw
everything except his face!

1489
01:29:14,417 --> 01:29:17,583
So instead of his face you ended up
seeing his...well you know what!

1490
01:29:18,167 --> 01:29:19,875
Viji, you leave.
I'll take care.

1491
01:29:20,208 --> 01:29:21,875
- No but listen to me...
- I said leave!

1492
01:29:32,792 --> 01:29:33,708
Hey you! Come here.

1493
01:29:43,250 --> 01:29:44,042
Greetings sir.

1494
01:29:44,417 --> 01:29:45,500
Why are you running?

1495
01:29:45,708 --> 01:29:46,375
Who are you?

1496
01:29:46,375 --> 01:29:48,583
One of the lamb's kid
escaped from the field.

1497
01:29:48,833 --> 01:29:49,458
Hence I was...

1498
01:29:49,542 --> 01:29:51,125
How do I go to
Krishnapuram village?

1499
01:29:51,167 --> 01:29:53,000
Follow this road. 2 kms ahead.

1500
01:29:54,042 --> 01:29:55,250
Fine. Get in.

1501
01:29:57,917 --> 01:29:58,625
I said get in!

1502
01:30:12,667 --> 01:30:15,167
Do you know Muthuramalingam?

1503
01:30:15,583 --> 01:30:16,292
I do sir.

1504
01:30:16,417 --> 01:30:17,917
I hear that he is
quite a tough guy?

1505
01:30:18,542 --> 01:30:19,375
Indeed he is.

1506
01:30:23,125 --> 01:30:24,958
He never attacks
anyone from behind.

1507
01:30:25,583 --> 01:30:29,500
Even I like cases that challenge
me not the silly ones!

1508
01:30:31,917 --> 01:30:32,542
Sir...

1509
01:30:32,917 --> 01:30:34,292
this is Krishnapuram.

1510
01:30:37,750 --> 01:30:38,417
May I leave now?

1511
01:30:39,250 --> 01:30:39,875
Ok sir.

1512
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:41,750
Hold on.

1513
01:30:42,875 --> 01:30:44,375
Call me if you see him anywhere.

1514
01:30:45,917 --> 01:30:47,125
Sir, your phone number?

1515
01:30:47,458 --> 01:30:50,167
- "99"
- "99"

1516
01:30:50,250 --> 01:30:52,125
- "42"
- "42"

1517
01:30:52,208 --> 01:30:54,000
- "88"
- "88"

1518
01:30:54,083 --> 01:30:55,625
- "62"
- "62"

1519
01:30:55,667 --> 01:30:57,333
- "36"
- "36"

1520
01:30:58,625 --> 01:30:59,292
See you.

1521
01:31:18,167 --> 01:31:18,625
Hello?

1522
01:31:18,792 --> 01:31:19,625
DSP!

1523
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
Have you ever met
Muthuramalingam?

1524
01:31:24,542 --> 01:31:25,917
If you ever come across him...

1525
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:27,500
I'll salute you!

1526
01:31:28,708 --> 01:31:30,083
Check your whatsapp message.

1527
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,333
I'll have the looks
of a daring lion!

1528
01:31:42,375 --> 01:31:45,083
Next time I meet you, the bullet
in my gun will find your forehead!

1529
01:31:45,083 --> 01:31:48,458
I ain't a duck to shoot and hunt!

1530
01:31:50,042 --> 01:31:51,583
I am like the eagle!

1531
01:31:58,375 --> 01:32:01,292
(Song from the movie "Amaran")

1532
01:32:29,083 --> 01:32:29,750
Sir!

1533
01:32:33,208 --> 01:32:34,958
I met Muthuramalingam in person!

1534
01:32:36,250 --> 01:32:37,542
This is Muthuramalingam!

1535
01:32:39,083 --> 01:32:42,125
Stick bills all over with his photo
with the heading "Most wanted".

1536
01:32:42,292 --> 01:32:42,833
Ok sir.

1537
01:32:44,875 --> 01:32:46,500
So that was Muthuramalingam?

1538
01:32:47,458 --> 01:32:49,708
We could've nabbed him on
our first day at duty here!

1539
01:32:49,708 --> 01:32:51,750
But you foiled it! Thinking he was
just student, blazing fire...

1540
01:32:51,750 --> 01:32:54,958
You saluted him and said he
would go on to become DSP!

1541
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:56,542
You made me also salute him.

1542
01:32:56,625 --> 01:32:59,583
Wasn't it you who asked
me to salute him?

1543
01:32:59,625 --> 01:33:00,750
You too are a part of it!

1544
01:33:00,833 --> 01:33:02,917
So deleted that photo of
mine with him right away!

1545
01:33:02,917 --> 01:33:05,250
You were all pepped up
while clicking the still?

1546
01:33:05,500 --> 01:33:07,167
Over that you got his autograph!

1547
01:33:08,417 --> 01:33:09,417
The autograph!

1548
01:33:12,458 --> 01:33:13,750
Catch me if you can!

1549
01:33:13,958 --> 01:33:15,375
If not watch me play my game!

1550
01:33:15,583 --> 01:33:16,333
With rage,

1551
01:33:16,333 --> 01:33:18,833
Look at that he is
signing off with a rage!

1552
01:33:18,958 --> 01:33:21,750
With Rage,
                              Muthuramalingam!

1553
01:33:23,542 --> 01:33:25,000
What did you just do?

1554
01:33:25,125 --> 01:33:27,167
I'm getting rid of the evidence.

1555
01:33:27,458 --> 01:33:29,375
Don't worry we'll nab
Muthuramalingam!

1556
01:33:30,083 --> 01:33:31,000
No we won't miss!

1557
01:33:35,083 --> 01:33:36,083
Where are you off to?

1558
01:33:36,167 --> 01:33:38,833
I've been patient enough!
You don't seem to change!

1559
01:33:38,875 --> 01:33:42,042
If I inform this to Muthuramalingam
he'll rip you apart!

1560
01:33:42,083 --> 01:33:44,125
Not if I finish you off first!

1561
01:33:44,125 --> 01:33:46,750
Stop! I'll finish
you off today!

1562
01:33:47,208 --> 01:33:47,750
Stop!

1563
01:33:51,542 --> 01:33:53,750
I won't rest until I finish you off!

1564
01:33:54,083 --> 01:33:55,125
Stop! Stop running!

1565
01:33:59,208 --> 01:34:00,083
Dear!

1566
01:34:02,250 --> 01:34:03,417
He wants to kill me!

1567
01:34:03,958 --> 01:34:04,875
Please save me!

1568
01:34:08,875 --> 01:34:09,458
Dear!

1569
01:34:09,917 --> 01:34:12,708
It's my husband who is giving
police all information about you!

1570
01:34:12,750 --> 01:34:14,417
He'll head right
to the police now!

1571
01:34:14,500 --> 01:34:17,167
You better escape before
the police reaches here.

1572
01:34:17,375 --> 01:34:19,500
Let fate seal my destiny.

1573
01:34:19,708 --> 01:34:21,833
You leave! Please!

1574
01:34:29,333 --> 01:34:29,958
Look here.

1575
01:34:30,208 --> 01:34:32,500
The police might
round us up anytime.

1576
01:34:32,500 --> 01:34:34,125
So be careful. Understand?

1577
01:34:38,583 --> 01:34:39,083
What is it?

1578
01:34:39,083 --> 01:34:42,667
Looks like Grams wife wants to meet
you and share something important.

1579
01:34:44,833 --> 01:34:46,208
- Go get her.
- Ok sir.

1580
01:34:52,750 --> 01:34:54,333
Forgive me.

1581
01:34:55,667 --> 01:34:57,417
- Please forgive me.
- Get up dear.

1582
01:34:57,583 --> 01:34:59,208
Why are you pleading
forgiveness to me?

1583
01:34:59,208 --> 01:34:59,958
Get up.

1584
01:35:01,375 --> 01:35:01,958
Get up.

1585
01:35:02,375 --> 01:35:03,375
Why are you crying?

1586
01:35:03,833 --> 01:35:08,000
It's my husband who is giving
police all information about you!

1587
01:35:08,333 --> 01:35:09,750
He is a government servant.

1588
01:35:09,750 --> 01:35:11,375
He is doing his duty.

1589
01:35:11,375 --> 01:35:12,667
Why do you feel bad for that?

1590
01:35:12,875 --> 01:35:15,083
For betraying you...

1591
01:35:15,083 --> 01:35:18,000
god punished me with no
kids in this birth of mine.

1592
01:35:18,917 --> 01:35:20,542
You betrayed me?

1593
01:35:21,417 --> 01:35:22,250
Yes.

1594
01:35:23,125 --> 01:35:27,083
24 years ago you had been
to your deity's temple...

1595
01:35:30,625 --> 01:35:31,625
Look here Ramiah!

1596
01:35:31,833 --> 01:35:34,292
The cultivation land that
belongs to the temple trust...

1597
01:35:34,458 --> 01:35:36,292
is been used up by your
family for generations!

1598
01:35:36,375 --> 01:35:39,042
We need to build a temple.
So you better evacuate it!

1599
01:35:39,125 --> 01:35:41,083
Let the god come
down and request...

1600
01:35:41,292 --> 01:35:43,250
we shall then evacuate!

1601
01:35:43,458 --> 01:35:46,917
Look here! You have
nothing to do with it!

1602
01:35:46,917 --> 01:35:51,333
There 2000 families that
worships this deity!

1603
01:35:51,375 --> 01:35:56,125
If there is one real man with guts,
in any of these 2000 families,

1604
01:35:56,167 --> 01:36:01,083
then face me off in a spear fight and
then talk about claiming the land!

1605
01:36:05,292 --> 01:36:06,500
I accept your challenge!

1606
01:36:06,958 --> 01:36:08,458
Who do you think the
land belongs to?

1607
01:36:08,458 --> 01:36:09,750
Is it your father's?

1608
01:36:09,875 --> 01:36:11,625
It my forefathers'!

1609
01:36:12,167 --> 01:36:15,917
So better be careful
and reach home safe!

1610
01:36:15,958 --> 01:36:18,792
We'll see that!

1611
01:36:18,833 --> 01:36:20,500
But after the fight!

1612
01:36:20,542 --> 01:36:21,458
Come try me!

1613
01:37:06,167 --> 01:37:06,625
Ramiah!

1614
01:37:08,042 --> 01:37:09,833
I've just slit your ear for now.

1615
01:37:10,458 --> 01:37:12,542
If you invade temple's
wealth again...

1616
01:37:12,750 --> 01:37:14,000
I'll chop your legs off!

1617
01:37:14,083 --> 01:37:14,667
Get lost!

1618
01:37:14,750 --> 01:37:15,292
Mookiah!

1619
01:37:15,958 --> 01:37:19,083
You can't block me like the
water coming out of a tap!

1620
01:37:19,208 --> 01:37:20,875
I'm the water that falls down the dams!

1621
01:37:21,167 --> 01:37:22,958
Come in my way and
I'll finish you off!

1622
01:37:28,250 --> 01:37:30,125
Mookiah, who came from Ilanji...

1623
01:37:30,458 --> 01:37:33,375
messed with me unnecessarily
and he chopped my ear!

1624
01:37:33,708 --> 01:37:35,208
File a FIR on him!

1625
01:37:35,375 --> 01:37:37,125
Inspector has stepped out.
He'll be back any minute.

1626
01:37:37,208 --> 01:37:38,542
I said file a FIR!

1627
01:37:38,667 --> 01:37:41,000
No sir! FIR cannot be filed
without inspector's approval!

1628
01:37:41,042 --> 01:37:42,167
- Lawyer!
- Sir?

1629
01:37:42,167 --> 01:37:42,917
File it!

1630
01:37:53,292 --> 01:37:54,500
Inspector!

1631
01:37:55,125 --> 01:37:57,208
Don't you mess with us!

1632
01:37:57,750 --> 01:37:59,042
We'll finish you off!

1633
01:38:00,375 --> 01:38:01,083
Ramiah!

1634
01:38:01,667 --> 01:38:05,083
This ain't your accounts
to write as you wish!

1635
01:38:05,167 --> 01:38:06,208
It's FIR!

1636
01:38:06,333 --> 01:38:10,250
Once inked, it becomes
questionable in the court!

1637
01:38:11,125 --> 01:38:14,625
So! You guys will have a
spat over temple's wealth!

1638
01:38:15,042 --> 01:38:17,875
Later you all will make
peace and celebrate!

1639
01:38:18,625 --> 01:38:20,667
I won't charge any
complaint on Mookiah!

1640
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:22,958
Aren't you a real man?

1641
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:25,208
Go chop off his ear!

1642
01:38:25,417 --> 01:38:27,333
Let him come down to
file a case against you.

1643
01:38:27,417 --> 01:38:29,250
Then I shall file
case on both of you!

1644
01:38:29,333 --> 01:38:30,458
Then continue your
spat in the court!

1645
01:38:30,458 --> 01:38:33,333
Your duty is to abide by
the law and file the FIR!

1646
01:38:33,458 --> 01:38:35,417
If you wanna talk about the
wealth, deal it in the court!

1647
01:38:35,500 --> 01:38:37,208
First, file a case on
Mookiah and arrest him!

1648
01:38:37,208 --> 01:38:38,458
I won't!

1649
01:38:38,583 --> 01:38:39,708
What can you do?

1650
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:42,750
You won't?

1651
01:38:42,875 --> 01:38:43,500
Ramiah!

1652
01:38:44,125 --> 01:38:46,458
We both are descendants
of the same dynasty!

1653
01:38:46,667 --> 01:38:48,958
We belong to the same
community and caste!

1654
01:38:49,417 --> 01:38:51,625
I ain't your slave!

1655
01:38:51,625 --> 01:38:53,083
I'm like the bullet in the gun.

1656
01:38:53,375 --> 01:38:54,375
Don't you trigger me!

1657
01:38:54,750 --> 01:38:55,750
I'll destroy you!

1658
01:38:56,250 --> 01:39:00,458
I'll file a case on you and your men
claiming to have attacked the police!

1659
01:39:00,625 --> 01:39:01,708
I'll throw you behind bars!

1660
01:39:02,792 --> 01:39:03,667
Be careful!

1661
01:39:03,833 --> 01:39:04,458
Inspector!

1662
01:39:05,333 --> 01:39:08,667
Your bullet can only
pierce my chest...

1663
01:39:08,792 --> 01:39:12,708
but my orders can finish
off your whole family!

1664
01:39:38,375 --> 01:39:40,542
Nothing to worry. The wound
will heal in a week's time.

1665
01:39:40,542 --> 01:39:42,875
This wound won't
heal in one week!

1666
01:39:43,167 --> 01:39:45,708
This is a scar for life!

1667
01:39:47,083 --> 01:39:48,333
Not here...

1668
01:39:48,417 --> 01:39:49,000
but here!

1669
01:40:20,917 --> 01:40:21,542
Ramiah!

1670
01:40:22,458 --> 01:40:25,875
Mookiah's wife and Inspector's wife
are admitted here for their delivery.

1671
01:40:26,125 --> 01:40:27,708
Both have delivered baby boys.

1672
01:40:27,875 --> 01:40:31,083
I am going to arrange men to finish
both Inspector and Mookiah here itself!

1673
01:40:31,875 --> 01:40:33,250
The police is everywhere.

1674
01:40:33,458 --> 01:40:34,292
Leave.

1675
01:40:35,875 --> 01:40:36,667
I said leave!

1676
01:40:46,750 --> 01:40:47,458
Dear niece!

1677
01:40:49,833 --> 01:40:50,417
Yes uncle.

1678
01:40:50,583 --> 01:40:52,667
You must do me a favor.

1679
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:54,333
Mookiah Devar's wife and...

1680
01:40:54,583 --> 01:40:55,958
inspector's wife...

1681
01:40:56,042 --> 01:40:57,667
both have given
birth to baby boys.

1682
01:40:58,250 --> 01:41:04,167
Swap those babies.

1683
01:41:05,417 --> 01:41:10,000
The only reason your family
survives today is because of me.

1684
01:41:54,708 --> 01:41:57,042
I knew something
was gonna hit me!

1685
01:41:57,833 --> 01:42:00,333
It has hit me right on head!

1686
01:42:00,375 --> 01:42:05,625
I've been regretting this
mistake of mine for years!

1687
01:42:06,417 --> 01:42:08,375
I plead you...

1688
01:42:08,375 --> 01:42:09,750
Please no!

1689
01:42:09,750 --> 01:42:10,958
I am the sinner here!

1690
01:42:11,375 --> 01:42:13,875
Let this secret be between
you and me alone.

1691
01:42:13,917 --> 01:42:15,875
Do not let anyone know about it!

1692
01:42:15,875 --> 01:42:17,375
I promise I won't.

1693
01:42:17,417 --> 01:42:20,625
Especially my wife. She'll
die if she hears this.

1694
01:42:30,542 --> 01:42:33,042
Everyone in this village looks furious.
Let's leave this place.

1695
01:42:33,042 --> 01:42:36,250
I imported horse from the capital
in order to nab Muthuramalingam.

1696
01:42:36,292 --> 01:42:36,958
That's fine.

1697
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:40,000
You can use that horse for horse
riding and make a living out of it.

1698
01:42:40,042 --> 01:42:40,750
Kalakeya!

1699
01:42:41,500 --> 01:42:42,292
Muthuramalingam!

1700
01:42:42,750 --> 01:42:43,333
Sir!

1701
01:42:43,417 --> 01:42:45,125
Aren't you here to catch me?

1702
01:42:45,292 --> 01:42:45,958
No! Yes!

1703
01:42:46,042 --> 01:42:48,083
Only if you have hands you'll catch me.
Isn't it?

1704
01:42:58,833 --> 01:43:02,250
Now what was that? Instead of chopping your
hands off he paid you respect and left?

1705
01:43:02,250 --> 01:43:04,792
You won't realize why
he did that from there.

1706
01:43:05,167 --> 01:43:07,208
Come in front of me.

1707
01:43:09,083 --> 01:43:11,958
So was it these men
who saved you?

1708
01:43:12,083 --> 01:43:12,750
Indeed!

1709
01:43:13,125 --> 01:43:16,708
This great leader here is the first person
to raise is voice for our independence!

1710
01:43:16,958 --> 01:43:22,000
And this great leader here made whole community
understand the ways of spirituality.

1711
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:25,250
We should never forget
both this great leaders!

1712
01:43:26,042 --> 01:43:26,833
Thank you!

1713
01:43:27,167 --> 01:43:28,042
Jai Hind!

1714
01:43:36,250 --> 01:43:36,833
Move!

1715
01:43:36,917 --> 01:43:38,042
Don't be stubborn!

1716
01:43:42,292 --> 01:43:45,583
Don't you know that it's a
crime to help an accused?

1717
01:43:46,583 --> 01:43:49,500
It's the duty of the police to
arrest Muthuramalingam and Mookiah.

1718
01:43:50,708 --> 01:43:52,125
You must help us.

1719
01:43:52,667 --> 01:43:53,208
Got it?

1720
01:43:53,208 --> 01:43:56,000
I am not the one to be intimidated
by the police or the gun.

1721
01:43:56,250 --> 01:43:57,708
I can match you to your wits!

1722
01:43:57,708 --> 01:43:59,333
She is showing too
much of attitude!

1723
01:43:59,417 --> 01:44:02,208
Mind your words or else
I'll break your face!

1724
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,167
He and his men are
hiding like cowards!

1725
01:44:10,375 --> 01:44:12,625
Ask him to show up
if he is a real man!

1726
01:44:16,292 --> 01:44:17,250
Look DSP!

1727
01:44:17,500 --> 01:44:23,083
If you a real man with guts then loose the uniform and challenge
Muthuramalingam to one on one Silambam with blade fight, like a normal man!

1728
01:44:23,083 --> 01:44:26,167
If a drop of blood sheds from
Muthuramalingam's forehead...

1729
01:44:26,667 --> 01:44:27,833
then not only on him...

1730
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:31,625
you can press any number of
charges on all the 15 families!

1731
01:44:31,875 --> 01:44:34,000
Slam with prison time for
any number of years.

1732
01:44:34,042 --> 01:44:36,292
But instead if you bleed
from your forehead...

1733
01:44:36,750 --> 01:44:39,625
will you clear everyone of the charges
and leave our village for good?

1734
01:44:40,042 --> 01:44:41,750
I dare you to accept
the challenge!

1735
01:44:46,083 --> 01:44:47,000
I accept!

1736
01:44:48,958 --> 01:44:51,625
Find out from Muthuramalingam
when and where?

1737
01:44:53,958 --> 01:44:58,667
We must use our brains and powers
according to the situations.

1738
01:44:58,708 --> 01:45:01,625
But I've no idea how you are
going to handle Muthuramalingam.

1739
01:45:02,292 --> 01:45:06,000
Sir, there are 3000 cops
in Tirunelveli district.

1740
01:45:06,333 --> 01:45:08,750
Out of them, 10 are
Silambam experts.

1741
01:45:09,083 --> 01:45:12,000
I'll fight all those 10
and win them first!

1742
01:45:12,542 --> 01:45:14,667
Muthuramalingam will
be my 11th opponent.

1743
01:45:14,750 --> 01:45:16,750
Sir, even if DSP loses...

1744
01:45:17,083 --> 01:45:18,875
we will go arrest
everyone at the spot.

1745
01:45:18,875 --> 01:45:20,542
What do you mean Ramarajan?

1746
01:45:20,583 --> 01:45:21,958
You'll go ahead and arrest...

1747
01:45:22,042 --> 01:45:23,875
but then they'll
stir off a riot!

1748
01:45:23,958 --> 01:45:25,583
Can you fire at the public?

1749
01:45:25,667 --> 01:45:28,875
We must be the ones who control
riots not the ones who stir it!

1750
01:45:29,417 --> 01:45:31,417
It's indeed wrong to have chopped
a police officer's hand.

1751
01:45:31,417 --> 01:45:34,208
75% of police officers sport a mustache
and believe in it's sentiment.

1752
01:45:34,417 --> 01:45:36,833
Will we ever spare anyone
if disrespects that?

1753
01:45:37,875 --> 01:45:38,875
Mr. Ashok Pandian...

1754
01:45:38,875 --> 01:45:39,417
Sir!

1755
01:45:39,500 --> 01:45:40,375
You can proceed.

1756
01:45:40,917 --> 01:45:41,917
I wish you all the best.

1757
01:46:23,500 --> 01:46:24,000
Sir.

1758
01:46:24,458 --> 01:46:26,000
I've won this
battle of Silambam.

1759
01:46:26,542 --> 01:46:28,667
But the challenge is to
play Silambam with a blade.

1760
01:46:28,750 --> 01:46:30,833
I need to get trained
on it from an expert.

1761
01:46:32,167 --> 01:46:35,000
Sir, there is a person named
Ramiah in Tirunelveli.

1762
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:35,958
Bring him in at once.

1763
01:46:35,958 --> 01:46:36,417
Yes sir.

1764
01:46:51,167 --> 01:46:52,625
- Greetings DSP.
- Greetings.

1765
01:46:52,625 --> 01:46:53,750
I am Ramiah Devar.

1766
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:54,875
That's my father.

1767
01:46:55,250 --> 01:46:55,875
Greetings sir!

1768
01:46:57,083 --> 01:47:00,167
I hear that you are an expert
in Silambam with blade?

1769
01:47:00,208 --> 01:47:03,000
Silambam with blade ain't a
walk in the park DSP sir.

1770
01:47:03,083 --> 01:47:05,208
Why do you even wanna
play this sport?

1771
01:47:05,250 --> 01:47:07,333
Are you participating
in any contest?

1772
01:47:07,333 --> 01:47:07,917
Indeed.

1773
01:47:08,042 --> 01:47:09,500
Against an accused.

1774
01:47:09,917 --> 01:47:12,417
Ilanji Mookiah Devar's
son Muthuramalingam.

1775
01:47:12,458 --> 01:47:14,208
He chopped off a
police officer's hand.

1776
01:47:14,542 --> 01:47:15,917
I'm sure you must have heard.

1777
01:47:16,458 --> 01:47:18,833
In order to make them
surrender to me...

1778
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:20,667
I must win in
Silambam with blade.

1779
01:47:21,833 --> 01:47:24,208
I must tear his forehead
and make him shed blood.

1780
01:47:24,708 --> 01:47:26,625
I'll definitely
help you learn it.

1781
01:47:30,042 --> 01:47:30,708
I'll be back.

1782
01:47:37,542 --> 01:47:39,583
What's with that wicked smile?

1783
01:47:39,667 --> 01:47:44,625
For all the embarrassment I faced from Inspector
Sethuraman by not filing my complaint...

1784
01:47:44,667 --> 01:47:47,375
and for get insulted
by Mookiah Devar...

1785
01:47:48,125 --> 01:47:50,417
it's time to take my revenge.

1786
01:47:50,958 --> 01:47:54,667
This DSP is the kid that was
bought up by Sethuraman.

1787
01:47:54,958 --> 01:47:59,250
We'll let both their children compete and
finish off each other in this competition!

1788
01:47:59,375 --> 01:48:01,958
Both their fathers must weep
watching their sons die!

1789
01:48:02,208 --> 01:48:04,833
You are like half Kshatriyan
and half Chanakya!

1790
01:48:05,042 --> 01:48:05,750
Nope!

1791
01:48:06,042 --> 01:48:07,833
You are a complete
Saguni the meddler!

1792
01:48:36,500 --> 01:48:37,667
Oh dear lord Ayyiannar!

1793
01:48:37,750 --> 01:48:40,833
Please be the savior to
my people and my land.

1794
01:48:41,583 --> 01:48:42,167
Uncle.

1795
01:48:43,083 --> 01:48:47,625
'Lorry' Ramaiah from Tirunelveli has been
training the DSP in Silambam with blade.

1796
01:48:47,958 --> 01:48:50,583
But I haven't seen you giving any
practice to Muthuramalingam.

1797
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:55,083
A real sportsman always stays
in touch and plays on any turf!

1798
01:49:15,458 --> 01:49:17,542
Dear we all are right behind you!

1799
01:49:17,583 --> 01:49:19,500
Men have gathered here from all
the neighboring 18 villages!

1800
01:49:19,500 --> 01:49:21,542
You victory is ours!

1801
01:49:21,583 --> 01:49:23,417
This mustache isn't mere hair!

1802
01:49:23,458 --> 01:49:24,792
It's a sentiment and
honor of a Tamilian!

1803
01:49:24,917 --> 01:49:26,000
So go for it and win it!

1804
01:52:11,250 --> 01:52:13,417
Come on son! Slit his forehead
and finish the game!

1805
01:52:29,958 --> 01:52:31,542
Sir, shall we arrest him?

1806
01:52:31,542 --> 01:52:32,042
No!

1807
01:52:32,417 --> 01:52:33,833
Police stands for discipline,

1808
01:52:34,292 --> 01:52:35,042
and honesty.

1809
01:52:35,333 --> 01:52:36,458
What do you say now?

1810
01:52:36,792 --> 01:52:38,875
I am too a descendant
of a royal blood.

1811
01:52:39,167 --> 01:52:40,917
I'll clear them of
all their charges.

1812
01:52:41,750 --> 01:52:42,417
Disperse!

1813
01:52:42,917 --> 01:52:48,750
This legacy of ours will
keep going on forever.

1814
01:52:52,250 --> 01:52:57,292
So keep advancing and progressing.

1815
01:52:58,708 --> 01:53:04,708
Let's not worry and stay courageous even
if we have to face the end of the world.

1816
01:53:11,208 --> 01:53:14,417
Don't you worry when I am here.

1817
01:53:14,458 --> 01:53:17,167
Don't loose your confidence.

1818
01:53:17,667 --> 01:53:20,667
So don't you worry and
don't loose yourself.

1819
01:53:20,750 --> 01:53:23,208
Stay brave hearted!

1820
01:53:23,750 --> 01:53:29,833
Let's change ourselves and
learn from our ancestors.

1821
01:53:30,167 --> 01:53:35,958
If we change for good then nothing
can stop us from progressing.

1822
01:53:36,542 --> 01:53:39,625
Don't you worry when I am here.

1823
01:53:39,667 --> 01:53:42,250
Don't loose your confidence.

1824
01:53:42,917 --> 01:53:45,958
So don't you worry and
don't loose yourself.

1825
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,583
Stay brave hearted!

1826
01:54:20,917 --> 01:54:23,792
Change is the only thing doesn't
change; rest everything changes.

1827
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,750
Life is full of ups and
down; so embrace it.

1828
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:33,125
We have been through a lot of
suffering, so let's learn from it.

1829
01:54:33,375 --> 01:54:39,417
No matter what people
say, you are our king.

1830
01:54:39,667 --> 01:54:45,750
You are our role model,
we celebrate you.

1831
01:54:45,875 --> 01:54:51,292
If you have a passion, pursue it!
The path will reveal itself.

1832
01:54:52,333 --> 01:54:57,833
Gain experience and strive hard,
The path will reveal itself.

1833
01:54:58,667 --> 01:55:01,750
Don't you worry when I am here.

1834
01:55:01,750 --> 01:55:04,417
Don't loose your confidence.

1835
01:55:04,792 --> 01:55:08,083
So don't you worry and
don't loose yourself.

1836
01:55:08,125 --> 01:55:10,667
Stay brave hearted!

1837
01:55:45,708 --> 01:55:51,500
As time keeps moving we learn to
depend on ourselves and progress.

1838
01:55:51,875 --> 01:55:57,875
We have seen enough of those who
envy, let's learn from it.

1839
01:55:58,167 --> 01:56:04,250
No matter what you
are our emperor.

1840
01:56:04,500 --> 01:56:10,708
You are the one who taught us to come
up and progress. We are you admirers.

1841
01:56:10,917 --> 01:56:16,333
It's our time so let's make the best of it.
Let's show the world.

1842
01:56:17,083 --> 01:56:22,708
Let's turn our experiences into lessons.
Let's lead the way.

1843
01:56:23,500 --> 01:56:26,583
Don't you worry when I am here.

1844
01:56:26,583 --> 01:56:29,333
Don't loose your confidence.

1845
01:56:29,750 --> 01:56:33,000
So don't you worry and
don't loose yourself.

1846
01:56:33,042 --> 01:56:35,792
Stay brave hearted!

1847
01:56:44,333 --> 01:56:46,583
Aren't you ashamed to lose?

1848
01:56:46,625 --> 01:56:47,917
Come on! Move.

1849
01:56:48,333 --> 01:56:49,750
He is hurt.

1850
01:56:50,042 --> 01:56:52,042
Try acting like a
responsible father.

1851
01:56:52,125 --> 01:56:53,208
Not like a police officer.

1852
01:56:53,250 --> 01:56:53,833
Well, no...

1853
01:56:54,042 --> 01:56:55,333
You please wait outside.

1854
01:56:55,583 --> 01:56:56,458
Please go out.

1855
01:56:57,875 --> 01:56:58,833
How do you feel?

1856
01:57:01,750 --> 01:57:03,792
Sir, I was asked to
pass this on to you.

1857
01:57:05,375 --> 01:57:06,458
Take rest. Ok?

1858
01:57:06,917 --> 01:57:08,958
Rest for a week then
resume working.

1859
01:57:10,292 --> 01:57:13,958
Are you feeling low that your
son lost the competition?

1860
01:57:15,208 --> 01:57:16,583
DSP Ashok Pandian...

1861
01:57:16,875 --> 01:57:17,917
isn't your son!

1862
01:57:21,208 --> 01:57:22,375
If you don't believe it...

1863
01:57:22,958 --> 01:57:24,375
take a DNA test.

1864
01:57:35,542 --> 01:57:36,000
Hello?

1865
01:57:36,375 --> 01:57:38,917
Are you in a dilemma
Sethuraman?

1866
01:57:40,208 --> 01:57:41,042
Who are you?

1867
01:57:41,542 --> 01:57:43,125
Do you know who I am?

1868
01:57:43,500 --> 01:57:44,375
I'll finish you off!

1869
01:57:44,500 --> 01:57:46,333
Stop threatening me!

1870
01:57:46,583 --> 01:57:48,292
Go take a DNA test.

1871
01:57:48,667 --> 01:57:50,042
You'll realize the truth.

1872
01:57:51,333 --> 01:57:51,875
Hello?

1873
01:57:52,958 --> 01:57:53,500
Hello?

1874
01:58:08,167 --> 01:58:09,583
Why do you look tensed?

1875
01:58:10,208 --> 01:58:10,750
Well...

1876
01:58:11,042 --> 01:58:12,875
Some rascal called up and said Ashok...

1877
01:58:13,583 --> 01:58:14,667
is not our son.

1878
01:58:15,292 --> 01:58:17,250
He said to take a DNA
test and confirm it.

1879
01:58:26,125 --> 01:58:27,667
Come on. Don't feel for it.

1880
01:58:28,208 --> 01:58:29,750
Ashok is indeed our son.

1881
01:58:30,375 --> 01:58:33,708
The minute doubts come in we will
lose happiness in our lives.

1882
01:58:33,958 --> 01:58:37,458
Don't get confused. This is
after all an anonymous letter.

1883
01:58:37,500 --> 01:58:39,417
Let's go ahead and take
the test if you want.

1884
01:59:08,417 --> 01:59:09,375
Don't worry.

1885
01:59:09,542 --> 01:59:10,375
I can't help it.

1886
01:59:13,375 --> 01:59:15,542
Yes. As per the DNA report...

1887
01:59:15,917 --> 01:59:19,042
DSP Ashok Pandian
is not your son.

1888
01:59:20,875 --> 01:59:22,208
What do you mean?

1889
01:59:22,292 --> 01:59:23,917
Then where is my real son?

1890
01:59:24,083 --> 01:59:25,250
Where is my real son?

1891
01:59:25,458 --> 01:59:26,250
Tell me!

1892
01:59:31,083 --> 01:59:31,625
Hello?

1893
01:59:32,750 --> 01:59:34,333
So do you believe now?

1894
01:59:35,833 --> 01:59:36,292
Please...

1895
01:59:37,083 --> 01:59:38,042
Please tell me.

1896
01:59:38,750 --> 01:59:39,625
Where is my son?

1897
01:59:39,917 --> 01:59:40,958
Does it hurt?

1898
01:59:41,583 --> 01:59:43,750
Isn't your wife worried?

1899
01:59:44,167 --> 01:59:44,917
She must be!

1900
01:59:45,250 --> 01:59:46,333
Who is it?

1901
01:59:46,458 --> 01:59:49,042
That's how I felt!

1902
01:59:49,750 --> 01:59:53,583
The guy who defeated your son in the
Silambam competition is your real son!

1903
01:59:55,500 --> 01:59:56,917
Muthuramalingam!

1904
01:59:57,125 --> 01:59:58,375
Now go! Go get him.

1905
01:59:59,750 --> 02:00:00,833
What is he saying?

1906
02:00:00,917 --> 02:00:01,917
Who is it?

1907
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:03,292
Where is my real son?

1908
02:00:03,375 --> 02:00:04,167
Say something!

1909
02:00:04,917 --> 02:00:05,500
I'll tell you.

1910
02:00:20,583 --> 02:00:23,750
Are you here with fake charges on
Muthuramalingam and Chief Mookiah Devar?

1911
02:00:25,333 --> 02:00:29,125
Isn't the issue resolved? The police cleared
them of all charges after losing the challenge!

1912
02:00:29,250 --> 02:00:32,917
I admire the respect you all have for
Muthuramalingam and chief Mookiah Devar.

1913
02:00:33,042 --> 02:00:35,125
I am here on a personal agenda.

1914
02:00:35,375 --> 02:00:36,542
So make way or...

1915
02:00:36,542 --> 02:00:40,667
go tell Mookiah Devar the IG
Sethuraman is here to meet him.

1916
02:00:40,833 --> 02:00:41,625
We shall.

1917
02:00:41,625 --> 02:00:43,833
But you must have your meeting
amidst all the villagers.

1918
02:00:44,208 --> 02:00:44,667
Ok.

1919
02:00:47,250 --> 02:00:48,500
- Dear nephew...
- Yes uncle

1920
02:00:48,583 --> 02:00:51,000
24 years ago at Seevalaperi
police station...

1921
02:00:51,333 --> 02:00:53,292
there was an inspector
by the name Sethuraman.

1922
02:00:53,583 --> 02:00:56,000
Please find out where he is now.

1923
02:00:56,042 --> 02:00:56,917
I'll find out.

1924
02:00:58,000 --> 02:00:58,542
Chief...

1925
02:00:59,250 --> 02:01:01,750
IG Sethuraman is
here to meet you.

1926
02:01:06,083 --> 02:01:07,792
Looks like fate has it's day.

1927
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:11,208
I wanted it to remain a secret.

1928
02:01:11,958 --> 02:01:14,417
Looks like my beloved,
Nachiyya is in for a shock.

1929
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:38,667
- Dad.
- Dad.

1930
02:01:40,458 --> 02:01:43,542
Please don't be
shocked to hear this.

1931
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:47,500
Muthuramalingam...

1932
02:01:48,125 --> 02:01:49,208
is not your son.

1933
02:01:54,708 --> 02:01:55,542
He is...

1934
02:01:56,208 --> 02:01:57,125
my son.

1935
02:02:05,208 --> 02:02:09,583
Please handover me my
son, Muthuramalingam.

1936
02:02:20,458 --> 02:02:22,083
- Please return me my son.
- Move!

1937
02:02:22,125 --> 02:02:22,792
I said move!

1938
02:02:23,875 --> 02:02:26,417
Please return me my son.

1939
02:02:26,750 --> 02:02:27,792
What's going on dear?

1940
02:02:28,042 --> 02:02:31,875
They are wrecking havoc in our lives by
saying that Muthuramalingam isn't our son...

1941
02:02:34,042 --> 02:02:36,417
and why aren't you doing
anything about it?

1942
02:02:38,542 --> 02:02:39,875
Who are they?

1943
02:02:40,083 --> 02:02:41,333
Tell me! Who are they?

1944
02:02:41,458 --> 02:02:43,167
What do we've got
to do with them?

1945
02:02:43,375 --> 02:02:44,708
Don't you hear me?

1946
02:02:44,833 --> 02:02:46,667
Tell me! Who are these people?

1947
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:54,625
Sir...

1948
02:02:55,208 --> 02:02:57,792
We are the parents
of Muthuramalingam.

1949
02:02:58,458 --> 02:03:00,375
We found out about
this only now.

1950
02:03:00,667 --> 02:03:04,167
Not only that. There is something
else that you don't know too.

1951
02:03:04,958 --> 02:03:07,250
Ashok Pandian, who we
believed to be our son..

1952
02:03:08,208 --> 02:03:10,500
is your real son.

1953
02:03:15,833 --> 02:03:17,417
No! I won't believe this.

1954
02:03:17,500 --> 02:03:18,667
I won't believe this!

1955
02:03:19,125 --> 02:03:20,833
Muthuramalingam is my son.

1956
02:03:21,167 --> 02:03:25,542
I am the mother who gave birth to him and bought
him up with love and care for over 24 years.

1957
02:03:28,083 --> 02:03:29,875
Listen, aren't you a mother too?

1958
02:03:31,042 --> 02:03:33,208
Does this look like a
child's play to you?

1959
02:03:33,625 --> 02:03:36,208
My son Muthuramalingam
ain't a toy!

1960
02:03:36,333 --> 02:03:37,500
He is my life!

1961
02:03:38,542 --> 02:03:39,750
He is my life!

1962
02:03:41,458 --> 02:03:42,333
No Nachiyya!

1963
02:03:46,708 --> 02:03:48,542
Muthuramalingam isn't our son.

1964
02:04:19,917 --> 02:04:22,917
I already knew about the fact that
Muthuramalingam isn't our son.

1965
02:04:24,375 --> 02:04:26,708
I had kept it a secret
from you all this time.

1966
02:04:29,583 --> 02:04:34,667
I buried the secret inside me because I
know that you won't be able to bear it!

1967
02:04:38,583 --> 02:04:43,292
I prayed hard to our deity to keep anyone
from coming here in search of our son.

1968
02:04:45,083 --> 02:04:46,042
But fate!

1969
02:04:47,250 --> 02:04:50,292
Fate had other plans and here
they are in search of him!

1970
02:04:50,375 --> 02:04:51,875
Here they are in search of him!

1971
02:04:54,500 --> 02:04:58,292
I'm known for doing justice to all the
problems around here but what do I do now?

1972
02:05:01,500 --> 02:05:03,167
I'm helpless. What do I do?

1973
02:05:05,375 --> 02:05:06,792
Oh! Dear Nachiyya!

1974
02:05:10,542 --> 02:05:12,208
He is my son!

1975
02:05:22,750 --> 02:05:24,083
The root cause behind all this...

1976
02:05:24,750 --> 02:05:27,875
is Ramiah's vengeance on me.

1977
02:05:40,042 --> 02:05:41,042
Ramiah!

1978
02:05:43,083 --> 02:05:44,375
Ramiah!

1979
02:05:46,458 --> 02:05:47,917
Ramiah!

1980
02:06:14,417 --> 02:06:16,250
Hey! Finish him off!

1981
02:06:43,417 --> 02:06:46,000
He is Mookiah's original
son and his heir!

1982
02:06:46,167 --> 02:06:47,417
Burn him down to ashes!

1983
02:08:32,792 --> 02:08:33,875
Come on!

1984
02:08:54,417 --> 02:08:55,375
My son!

1985
02:08:55,917 --> 02:08:57,500
Dear Muthuramalingam!

1986
02:08:57,792 --> 02:08:58,708
Mom.

1987
02:08:59,500 --> 02:09:01,208
Muthu, you are my son!

1988
02:09:01,250 --> 02:09:03,375
Your my son. Come on.

1989
02:09:03,792 --> 02:09:06,667
Now, tell them....Tell them
you are not going anywhere!

1990
02:09:10,833 --> 02:09:12,708
Come on. Let's
leave to our home.

1991
02:09:12,792 --> 02:09:13,958
Muthuramalingam.

1992
02:09:15,375 --> 02:09:17,000
He belongs to me!

1993
02:09:18,208 --> 02:09:20,625
From here on he
must live with me.

1994
02:09:21,083 --> 02:09:23,458
- Come. Let's go home dear.
- Move dear!

1995
02:09:23,625 --> 02:09:25,083
I won't let him go!

1996
02:09:25,625 --> 02:09:27,792
There! That is your son!

1997
02:09:29,417 --> 02:09:31,792
Fine, let's say that
whatever you say is true.

1998
02:09:32,375 --> 02:09:36,250
Though I am not his birth
mother, I can't give him up!

1999
02:09:38,792 --> 02:09:40,583
I can sacrifice myself...

2000
02:09:41,917 --> 02:09:44,792
but I will never give up my son.

2001
02:09:46,167 --> 02:09:48,958
Please don't leave us brother!

2002
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:51,083
Please don't leave us!

2003
02:09:52,625 --> 02:09:54,458
Dad tell him!

2004
02:09:54,750 --> 02:09:56,750
Dad! Dad!

2005
02:09:59,708 --> 02:10:01,625
Tell him dad!

2006
02:10:02,083 --> 02:10:03,250
Dear brother!

2007
02:10:03,458 --> 02:10:04,667
Please don't leave us!

2008
02:10:05,625 --> 02:10:07,708
Look, send my son to me.

2009
02:10:08,167 --> 02:10:08,583
Or else...

2010
02:10:09,417 --> 02:10:10,750
I'll have to take legal actions.

2011
02:10:10,917 --> 02:10:12,750
Dear sister, they are right.

2012
02:10:13,625 --> 02:10:16,042
No matter what,
Muthuramalingam is their son.

2013
02:10:16,292 --> 02:10:18,208
Your love and affection
for him has blinded you.

2014
02:10:18,208 --> 02:10:21,250
If this issue goes to court, the
mother's love won't win it for you.

2015
02:10:21,458 --> 02:10:22,667
What's legal is what will win.

2016
02:10:22,667 --> 02:10:24,917
So please don't blow this
issue out of proportion.

2017
02:10:25,625 --> 02:10:28,000
You too?

2018
02:10:28,458 --> 02:10:32,375
Where are all those gods
whom I offered my prayers?

2019
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:35,750
Please, someone stop
this from happening!

2020
02:10:35,917 --> 02:10:37,708
Please stop my son
from leaving me.

2021
02:10:37,958 --> 02:10:40,208
Sir please! Please don't take away my son!

2022
02:10:40,375 --> 02:10:41,875
I plead you!

2023
02:10:42,125 --> 02:10:43,083
I plead you!

2024
02:10:43,125 --> 02:10:44,042
Muthuramalingam...

2025
02:10:46,583 --> 02:10:47,292
Leave.

2026
02:10:52,667 --> 02:10:54,500
What are you saying?

2027
02:10:57,917 --> 02:10:58,958
Leave!

2028
02:11:02,792 --> 02:11:04,208
Go away with your parents.

2029
02:11:06,750 --> 02:11:07,500
Dad?

2030
02:11:08,708 --> 02:11:09,708
Leave!

2031
02:11:15,250 --> 02:11:17,125
He's leaving! No!

2032
02:11:21,750 --> 02:11:23,875
No! Don't leave us!

2033
02:11:29,167 --> 02:11:30,083
Come on dear.

2034
02:11:31,208 --> 02:11:31,875
Dear...

2035
02:11:33,875 --> 02:11:34,750
Dad!

2036
02:11:35,375 --> 02:11:36,333
What is it?

2037
02:11:36,667 --> 02:11:37,625
For the final time...

2038
02:11:38,792 --> 02:11:40,917
can I do our 'dash on the
forehead' thing?

2039
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:49,333
Remember Muthuramalingam! You aren't just
leaving dashing your dad's forehead...

2040
02:12:49,375 --> 02:12:52,208
you leaving dashing all
our hopes and lives.

2041
02:12:52,292 --> 02:12:56,042
You are such an obedient son that you are
leaving just because your dad ordered you!

2042
02:12:58,167 --> 02:13:03,083
Your mother's voice that keeps calling out
"Muthuramalingam! Muthuramalingam!"...

2043
02:13:03,208 --> 02:13:06,167
will not be heard of anymore and
it is going to crush her heart.

2044
02:13:07,917 --> 02:13:13,000
You are the one who taught the our children
Silambam and to live with courage.

2045
02:13:13,500 --> 02:13:16,667
And now you are leaving all of
us stranded, Muthuramalingam!

2046
02:13:18,500 --> 02:13:22,708
Lady, you are taking away our
Muthuramalingam. who is like a god to us!

2047
02:13:22,792 --> 02:13:25,625
Whom will turn to now,
when we need him?

2048
02:13:29,875 --> 02:13:32,000
Muthuramalingam!

2049
02:13:35,125 --> 02:13:40,583
Instead of taking you with
me for my happiness...

2050
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:45,500
I shall leave you here for the
happiness of all of these people.

2051
02:13:45,667 --> 02:13:48,167
You be happy with them.

2052
02:13:50,583 --> 02:13:52,417
Stay happy forever.

2053
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:54,042
Go back.

2054
02:13:54,208 --> 02:13:56,000
Go back to them!

2055
02:14:05,917 --> 02:14:07,083
Ashok...

2056
02:14:07,375 --> 02:14:09,833
you'll always stay our son.

2057
02:16:36,583 --> 02:16:39,708
