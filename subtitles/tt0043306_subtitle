1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:00,040
23.976

2
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,720
Spice for the front page, isn't it?
 - All you can think of are...

3
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,920
headlines for the front page.
 - Oh, drop it!

4
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,720
Here comes Judge Raghunath

5
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,680
Such a gentleman! Why on earth
 did that goon want to kill him?

6
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,480
Here comes your friend

7
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,280
Is the jury in place?

8
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,960
Yes, my Lord. Present

9
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,600
Is the accused present?
 - Present, my Lord

10
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,440
Who is the counsel for the accused?

11
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,080
Who is the counsel for the accused?

12
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,760
Have you no lawyer
 to defend your case?

13
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,160
In that case, the government...

14
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,560
My Lord

15
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,640
I'm the counsel for the accused

16
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,360
I do not wish to defend myself

17
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:54,120
I promised to defend you, if
 you're ever arraigned. Remember?

18
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,760
Does the accused give his consent?

19
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,600
Yes

20
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:14,920
Raj, you have been accused of
 a murderous attack on Judge Raghunath

21
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,120
You may plead your case

22
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,840
I swear to speak the truth

23
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,120
Judge Raghunath, can you tell us
 why the accused tried to kill you?

24
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,280
Did he have any enmity with you?

25
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:48,520
Yes. The grudge that a born felon
 bears against the judge...

26
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,400
who sentences him and
 grants no reprieve

27
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,000
Could there be no other reason
 for such animosity?

28
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,880
None. How else could I
 relate to him?

29
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,120
I have no further questions

30
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,240
Defense may proceed with
 cross-questioning

31
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,960
Judge, you are senior to me

32
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,000
If in the course of questioning,
 I happen to affront you...

33
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:32,040
do forgive me. Someone's life is
 at stake. And you have taught me...

34
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,080
to ignore all relationships for
 the dispensation of justice

35
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:43,280
This is my first interrogation.
 Please give me your blessings

36
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:55,600
What do you mean when you call
 the accused a born felon?

37
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,920
He has been a tramp and a hoodlum...

38
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,080
ever since he was a child.
 His record says it

39
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,560
This penchant for crime has surely
 been transmitted congenitally

40
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,640
Judge, do you have any children?

41
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,760
No

42
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,600
But how is this question relevant
 to this case?

43
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:18,840
Most relevant. Think again. Are you
 certain that you have no children?

44
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,880
No. But I reiterate. This question...
 - Can you recount the circumstance...

45
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:28,040
when you threw your wife
 out of your house?

46
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:32,200
My Lord, am I to be forced to reply
 to such meaningless questions?

47
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:37,000
Ms Rita, you may ask questions
 relevant only to the case

48
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,800
We wish to know whether or not,
 the accused attempted murder

49
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,640
If yes, then why?

50
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,560
Enough! Stop it! I'm a murderer!
 Hang me if you will!

51
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,160
Proceed with your questioning

52
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,240
The accused does not deny having
 assaulted Judge Raghunath

53
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,920
But, as you said just now,
 the question is why he did it

54
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,920
This interrogation is meant
 to reveal the answer...

55
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,600
if you my Lord, and Judge Raghunath
 repose your trust in me for a while

56
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,760
You may proceed

57
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,640
I repeat my question.
 Can you recount the circumstance...

58
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,320
when you threw your wife
 out of your house?

59
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,240
I beg your pardon, Judge Raghunath,
 but this question is very important

60
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,080
And not only for the accused.
 For you too

61
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:27,440
The cause of whatever is happening
 today, lies rooted in your past

62
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:29,920
Remember...?

63
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,800
Can you tell us? Why, when
 and under what circumstance...

64
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,240
did you throw your wife
 out of your house?

65
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,560
24 years ago...

66
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,480
I was practicing law in Lucknow

67
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:06,400
I was the black sheep of the family,
 because I opposed social norm...

68
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:12,200
and I had married a widow.
 My father was a big gun

69
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,440
and was away in Bombay most of the
 time. He was unhappy with me

70
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:19,120
But under no circumstance,
 was I willing to leave Leela

71
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,400
She was so good to me.
 She was such a good woman

72
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,720
And I was in love with her

73
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:36,040
But once, on our way from
 Kanpur to Allahabad...

74
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,640
little did I realize that
 like a boat in midstream...

75
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,120
my life too was to be caught
 in cross currents

76
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,840
"Cross currents in the midstream"

77
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,520
"Beware"

78
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,640
"In the current you will sink or sail"

79
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,240
"Beware"

80
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,080
"The open skies"

81
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,360
"Careful sailor"

82
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,640
"Your boat is headed into a storm"

83
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,720
"Restless flow the deep waters"

84
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,520
"Beware"

85
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,800
"Twigs are carried away"

86
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,920
"Steel sinks"

87
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,120
"So what do you think?"

88
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,640
"Beware"

89
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,800
Aren't you feeling sleepy?

90
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,280
What are you thinking about?
 - Why do they sing "Beware"?

91
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:56,720
They say, these parts are dangerous.
 Jagga the bandit. He's from these parts

92
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:00,320
Bandits...?
 - Yes, but don't worry

93
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,600
As of now, he must be fast asleep
 in some prison

94
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,960
Go to bed. I'm feeling sleepy

95
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,640
In case you're afraid, I can come over
 - No

96
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,880
No! The lady is with them!

97
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,360
Leave me!

98
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,520
You heartless bandits!

99
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,800
Where's your chief?

100
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,960
What right have you to terrorize
 women from good families?

101
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,480
Aren't you ashamed?
 - Ashamed?

102
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,440
Shame is for good folks,
 not for bandits and robbers

103
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:43,360
As for me, my grandfather was a bandit,
 my father was a bandit! But I wasn't

104
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:48,360
And your husband went and made me one!
 - My husband...?

105
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,760
Who are you?
 - Jagga. And I was innocent

106
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:57,520
But without a shard of evidence,
 your husband framed me...

107
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,840
just because my father, my grandfather
 were bandits

108
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,680
He framed me for rape
 and he sent me to jail

109
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:08,040
So I've decided to prove
 your husband right

110
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,680
Coward!

111
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,960
See what's wrong with her

112
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,600
Has she come to her senses?

113
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:29,160
No, she's still in a swoon

114
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:35,160
Let her go, Chief. She's pregnant.
 She's going to become a mother

115
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,520
Touch her, and you go to hell

116
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,520
Pregnant? With a baby?

117
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:52,960
Her husband said that children born
 of good folks turn out good

118
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,520
And children born of bandits...

119
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,880
turn out to be bandits. Always

120
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,640
Now let's see what the lawyer's son
 turns out to be

121
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,600
Send her back once she recovers

122
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:18,920
Good are those born of good folks!
 And of bandits are bandits born

123
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,720
You should make me a gift.
 - What's the occasion?

124
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,840
Not any occasion.
 The lady is back

125
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,320
What did you say? The lady?

126
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,960
Why is it dark in here?

127
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,920
Lights! Tonight we celebrate!

128
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,200
It is you who lights up my life

129
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:08,520
Now that you're back,
 even the lights seem so bright!

130
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,280
Give me the wick

131
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:22,640
But Leela, how did you escape?
 I hope you weren't in danger?

132
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,880
Your love was with me.
 How could anyone even look up at me?

133
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,840
You are tired. Change.
 I'll bring you your dressing grown

134
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,360
These last four days

135
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,360
The last four days were
 like a lifetime

136
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,360
I took the police and I looked
 everywhere for you

137
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,360
All the while, I feared...

138
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:09,680
I feared you were in grave danger!

139
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:19,560
But how did you escape?
 And who was this bandit?

140
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,400
Some Jagga. He said that you
 had convicted him

141
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:33,440
So he escaped to get even with me!
 If he has done anything to you...

142
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:37,360
I'll see to it that he hangs!
 - At heart, he's a devil

143
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,320
But God saved me at the last moment.
 Thank God!

144
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,120
Tell me something

145
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,200
Ask

146
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:53,720
Does a bandit's son necessarily
 become a bandit?

147
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,680
Yes, it's bound to happen

148
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,640
But why do you ask?

149
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,760
Just like that

150
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,440
Let's see what comes first.
 Your becoming a magistrate, or...

151
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:28,120
Why? Is someone expected?

152
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,920
A new guest

153
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,360
Now I don't have any chances
 of becoming a magistrate

154
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,680
Why? What happened?

155
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:43,080
Whatever... let's talk
 of something else

156
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,200
How do you like this?

157
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,680
Nice

158
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,520
Listen...

159
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,200
Are you annoyed with me?

160
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,280
Annoyed? No

161
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,880
Why should I be annoyed with you?

162
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,240
Have my lunch sent over

163
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,840
What's the matter?
 Where are the servants?

164
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,560
God knows! Maybe they're all dead!
 I have to do all the chores

165
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,960
Let me help you.
 - You'd rather tell her all this

166
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,560
She's sitting around like a queen!

167
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:37,000
Not to be cross with Leela.
 I told her not to strain herself

168
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:41,600
You know the condition she is in.
 And in a few days from now...

169
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:46,040
She's going to bear the fruit
 of her sins!

170
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,920
What are you saying?!
 - What everyone else is saying!

171
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:54,640
For four days, she lived with a bandit!
 And Jagga at that!

172
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,880
Don't you remember what
 he was convicted for?

173
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,280
Do you enjoy making someone unhappy?
 The jaundiced eye sees all yellow

174
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,600
Do you think you're beyond scrutiny?
 Don't you forget...

175
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,600
women have had to stand the test of
 chastity. Because society asks for it

176
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:07,960
Bhabhi!
 (Sister-in-law)

177
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,760
Forgive me Bhabhi,
 your pot is broken

178
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,600
It's only an earthen pot. But remember,
 a woman's honor is far more fragile

179
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,240
Once disgraced, her honor
 can never be redeemed

180
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:53,400
Did you not know that your wife
 was seeing her lover on the sly?

181
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,240
The villagers used to say that.
 But I didn't heed what they said

182
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,240
You haven't yet told the court
 why your wife deserted you

183
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,320
You know it! Women are adulterous!

184
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,960
I know what that means!

185
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,400
Raghu, how can you lose
 your cool in court?

186
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,840
I'm afraid your chances of
 magistrate ship may be clouded

187
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:29,160
Chances of a magistrate ship?
 That's out of question now

188
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:35,960
Can a lawyer whose wife is under
 suspicion ever become a magistrate?

189
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,520
The whole town is agog!
 - What are you saying?

190
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,200
Aren't you ashamed to talk like this
 about your wife?

191
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,400
I'm just saying what
 everyone is saying

192
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,200
Let them say what they want

193
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:58,360
You're right. That's what I decided.
 Let them say what they want

194
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:05,880
But how do I get rid of the suspicion?
 It's like a leech sucking on...

195
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,720
some dark corner of my mind!
 - What now...?

196
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,040
Where's everyone?

197
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,280
Send Bhabhi over to me

198
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,720
Oh, I'm so afraid!

199
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,040
Why isn't someone coming to me?

200
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:55,040
That's my husband. Please,
 send him over to me

201
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,480
Look Raghu...

202
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,760
I'm telling you again! That baby
 isn't going to be born in this house

203
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,840
If she wants to have her bastard,
 let her go elsewhere

204
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,400
I'm not going to let the honor
 of my family be tainted

205
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,080
I'm going to throw this
 wanton woman out!

206
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,800
No! I'm not going anywhere!
 No one can take me away from here!

207
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:25,760
He knows that I'm innocent!
 He trusts me, he trusts me!

208
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:34,440
You're here! Now I'm afraid of no one!

209
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,760
Have you heard? They want
 to throw me out!

210
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:43,720
They say I'm a wanton woman!
 They say, I've no right to be here!

211
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:48,720
But now you're here.
 No one will dare anymore

212
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:54,760
Tell them I'm untainted!
 Tell them you trust me

213
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,120
Tell them I'm mothering your child

214
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,240
Why are you so quiet?

215
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,080
Have you fallen for what they say?

216
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,360
You're the one who told me...
 "I don't care for the baying dogs"

217
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,440
If you desert me, who else
 in this world can I turn to?

218
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:41,840
Tell me... tell me that you trust me!

219
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:46,080
"Do you think you're above scrutiny?
 Don't you forget..."

220
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,360
"women have had to stand
 the test of chastity"

221
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:13,760
Why are you quiet?
 Speak... speak!

222
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:20,080
You can see the state I'm in.
 I'm afraid... afraid!

223
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:25,640
I'm going to become a mother
 ...the mother of your child

224
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:32,680
Have mercy! This is your baby.
 This baby is yours!

225
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,280
Get out!
 Get out of here!

226
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:55,240
"The most chaste of women"

227
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:05,880
"Were banished"

228
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:11,360
"Why is not the earth rent asunder
 in sorrow?"

229
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:20,160
"Why are not the skies torn apart?"

230
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:25,000
"So suffers the girl her father
 raised lovingly"

231
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,360
"Her father raised her lovingly;
 her husband loved her once"

232
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:36,200
"Now she goes from door to door"

233
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:54,400
"Oh such games The Lord above plays"

234
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:14,280
"Oh such games The Lord above plays"

235
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:21,480
"In the oyster
 He makes the pearl blossom"

236
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:27,640
"In murky waters
 He makes the lotus bloom"

237
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:35,800
"Strange are your ways, Lord"

238
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:47,560
Congratulations, Lawyer!
 A son has born to you.

239
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,600
Son of a decent family!
 Born in a filthy gutter!

240
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,560
Do you not know what your wife
 and your son went through...

241
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,480
after you shut your doors on them?
 - No

242
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,240
Nor did you try to find out

243
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,120
But I can tell you

244
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,600
To get out of your way,
 your wife left Lucknow

245
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:24,080
And your innocent son grew up
 in a Bombay slum

246
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,920
One day...

247
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,000
Police! Scram!

248
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,480
Hey Nathu...

249
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,960
Hello, Constable

250
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,760
What are you up there like a monkey?
 Why don't you go to school?

251
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,840
At school, the master asks for fees

252
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:06,680
My father hasn't the money
 to send me to school

253
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,640
Look at Leela's son, Raj.
 He lives in this slum too

254
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:13,480
His mother is worse off. Yet she
 sends her boy to such a big school

255
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:17,960
What did you say? He isn't a boy.
 He's a sissy!

256
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:27,040
Ma, why do you put oil in my hair?
 - Oil keeps the hair soft

257
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,480
But why do boys in the neighborhood
 call me sissy?

258
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,760
So what? How do they
 compare with you?

259
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,560
You're a good boy
 who goes to school

260
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,680
You'll grow up to become
 an educated man

261
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,720
And those wayward boys
 will go to jail

262
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,960
Ma, what's wayward?

263
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:47,000
The ones who just tramp around

264
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,800
Those who think that whatever
 belongs to others, belongs to them

265
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:52,800
Those who gamble and drink
 instead of going to school

266
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,880
And they have fun!

267
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,640
Ma, when I grow up,
 I'll become wayward too

268
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:03,240
Nonsense! You'll become a lawyer

269
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,200
Then a magistrate

270
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,800
And then, a judge

271
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,240
You're sitting here?
 Everyone's out there buying chocolates

272
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,600
I don't have money

273
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,840
Why, doesn't your mother
 give you money?

274
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,440
Daddy gives me a whole Rupee
 every day!

275
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,720
You're rich. And I'm poor.

276
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,080
Eat this

277
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:34,200
No, Ma says never ask
 for anything to eat

278
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,520
If she told you not to ask,
 go ahead and snatch it

279
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,320
No!

280
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
You're coming to my place
 this evening, aren't you?

281
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,840
Why, what's happening?
 - My birthday party!

282
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,600
You must come! It's going to be fun!

283
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:54,880
You know, Daddy has ordered
 such a huge cake!

284
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,120
Let's go and eat ice cream

285
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:27,400
Raj, aren't you giving me a gift?

286
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:31,400
I didn't have money to buy anything.
 I'll give you some other time

287
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,440
Must you only buy something
 to make a gift?

288
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,160
You can give me a flower

289
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,160
Really?

290
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,760
Here you are

291
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,280
Someday, I'm going to make
 lots of money

292
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,760
And I'll buy a gift for you.
 Something better than all this

293
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,520
Do that

294
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,600
But can anything be better
 than this flower?

295
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,240
Come on Raj, meet my father

296
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:14,760
Ritu, say hello to the Judge

297
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,400
Hello, Judge

298
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:18,880
Bless you

299
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:24,000
You've grown up in these four years
 You must've forgotten me.

300
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,000
Happy birthday

301
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:32,000
I've just arrived from Lucknow.
 I owe you a present

302
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:36,960
As of now, I can give you a flower

303
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,600
Here you are

304
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,280
Let me put it on your hair

305
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,120
Someone has already put a flower
 over there

306
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,640
Raj has given me this flower

307
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,800
Daddy, this is Raj.
 He's in my class

308
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,640
I see
 - Hello

309
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,720
Hello

310
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,400
Hello

311
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,920
God bless you, son

312
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,360
Raj says that he will become a judge
 when he grows up

313
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,680
Very good!

314
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:13,520
Your father must be a real gentleman

315
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,640
What does your father do?

316
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,920
I don't have my father.
 I have only my mother

317
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,960
Has he passed away?
 - No! Don't say that!

318
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,760
My mother says he is alive.
 But...

319
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:33,600
He doesn't live with you
 ...and you haven't seen him either?

320
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:38,440
Your father is a strange man.
 - Not a word about my father

321
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,920
Else... else...

322
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:51,240
How can you let your daughter
 play with boys like him?

323
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,280
Go to play, Ritu

324
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:58,480
Why, what's wrong with the boy?
 I like him

325
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:03,960
He doesn't even know his father's
 name, and you like him?

326
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,600
I'd say he's just a wastrel
 - Forget it.

327
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,160
Must you hang on to
 those rotten old ideas?

328
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,160
What was the Bandit's name?

329
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,280
Yes, Jagga

330
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:17,920
I remember you saying the same
 at his trial

331
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:21,960
That a bandit's son
 always becomes a bandit

332
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,560
I still stand by that principle

333
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:27,080
Principles, principles and principles!
 It's because of these blind dogmas...

334
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:30,840
that you lost someone
 as precious as Leela

335
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,440
And because of your principles,
 you never married again

336
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,120
The dry parched desert that
 your life is, is your own doing

337
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,240
So much so that you would rather
 destroy a friendship...

338
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,480
between two innocent children?
 Why, what has the poor child done...

339
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,080
to bring you to harm?

340
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,520
Not this boy. But it was...

341
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:50,440
someone like him who destroyed my life
 ...and brought me to disgrace

342
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,200
Maybe today, he too says
 what this boy just said...

343
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,880
"I'm only my mother's son
 ...I have no father"

344
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:03,840
In every urchin I see him...

345
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,080
the one whom my wife bore,
 the one who isn't mine

346
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,920
My wife's, yet not mine

347
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,160
Rita looks good in that photo,
 doesn't she?

348
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:20,520
But Ma, why do you work so hard?
 This is why you fall ill

349
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,760
I'm not going to let you work
 anymore, you understand?

350
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:26,840
You mad boy! If I don't work,
 how are we going to eat?

351
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,160
I'm a man. I'm the one
 who is going to work

352
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,800
From tomorrow,
 no going to school!

353
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,920
You won't go to school?
 Won't you?

354
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,720
How will you become a gentleman,
 unless you educate yourself?

355
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,160
Wayward imp!

356
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:45,960
Without schooling, how can you become
 a lawyer, a magistrate, a judge?

357
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:54,080
If you say so, I'll go to school
 ...and I'll work too

358
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:57,920
But I won't become a judge.
 At Rita's I met a judge

359
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,360
I didn't like him

360
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,920
"Are you out for a good time?"

361
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:34,080
"Hey Mister, Hey Babu,
 Hey Mr. White, Mr. Black"

362
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,160
"Out on the streets
 we're waiting for you"

363
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,240
"We, the merry boot-polish boys"

364
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:51,280
Good morning, teacher.
 Sorry, I'm late

365
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,640
I work, you know. I work

366
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,200
What's all this?

367
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:59,640
Brush, wax... I give you a good polish

368
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,280
Your name has been struck
 from the rolls

369
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,560
What?
 - You can't study here anymore.

370
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:09,160
But I've brought the fees too! If you
 say so, I'll stop polishing boots

371
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,800
So I can't study here any longer,
 can I?

372
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:22,920
No

373
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,720
For a minute, can I talk to Rita?
 I have a gift for her

374
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:34,120
Rita's father has transferred her
 out of this school. They have moved

375
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,960
Why did you kick my ball?

376
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,640
Forgive me, I stepped on it
 by mistake

377
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,000
How dare a boot-polish-boy?
 - Hit him!

378
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:10,120
You're just a boot-polish boy.
 You dare take me on?

379
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:13,960
Hit him!

380
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:17,120
His coat... strip him!

381
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,200
Hit him!

382
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,240
My Ma is ill.
 Let me go to my Ma

383
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,520
You can hit me some other time.
 My Ma is ill. Let me go to my Ma

384
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,760
Your Ma is ill?
 - Yes

385
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,320
His Ma is ill!

386
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,960
Run! Uncle Jagga is here! Run!

387
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,400
Get up. Come with me

388
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,320
Where to?

389
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:37,840
Wherever I go. From now on,
 you go wherever I go

390
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,680
That's what your father wanted

391
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,560
You know my father?
 - Yes

392
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,960
I knew him

393
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:53,160
Whatever I am today,
 is all thanks to him

394
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:56,680
I owe your Dad an old debt

395
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:59,280
Then you'll surely help me
 find a job somewhere?

396
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:02,280
Job? What job?
 - Whatever! I'll do anything!

397
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,960
My Ma is sick! We haven't anything
 to eat! Give me any job!

398
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,520
I'll clean the dishes, sweep floors,
 carry luggage... I'll do anything!

399
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,240
Just give me a job! Give me a job!

400
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:15,320
You fool! Only fools work

401
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,400
You're a smart boy.
 And you talk of working?

402
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:21,240
Unless I work, how will I eat?
 How will I feed my mother?

403
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,240
Steal

404
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,480
Steal?

405
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,360
Stealing... no!

406
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:48,480
Yes, yes, yes!
 Steal! Steal! Steal!

407
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:51,560
Pick pockets, locks,
 rob, kill

408
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,320
You took so long, son

409
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:20,840
You've been hungry all day.
 Go on, eat food

410
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:25,880
Food? Have you cooked?
 - Yes, why not?

411
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:27,960
It's over there, under the plate

412
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:31,840
The bread is warm.
 I even cooked potatoes

413
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:34,720
Take some. It's on the shelf

414
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,480
Have you found it?

415
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:50,880
Yes Ma, I found it

416
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:56,240
The bread, and potatoes too

417
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,600
The potatoes are delicious

418
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:08,480
Eat it then. Give me a bread too.
 I'm very hungry

419
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:11,000
Very hungry

420
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,080
Bread...?

421
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:15,560
Yes, Ma. I'll get it right now

422
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:18,360
Right now

423
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:26,480
"Yes, yes, yes!
 Steal! Steal! Steal!"

424
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,840
"Pick pockets, locks,
 rob, kill"

425
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:49,800
You thief!

426
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:53,120
Stealing bread?
 - Excuse me, my Ma is hungry

427
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:54,880
She hasn't had anything to eat
 in three days

428
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,400
Son of a gun! Off you go to the cops!

429
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:05,480
What's your name?
 I asked you what's your name

430
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:08,360
Father's name?

431
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,880
Ma has never told me
 my father's name

432
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:13,960
Where does your mother live?
 I asked you where your mother lives

433
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:17,480
I won't tell you. I won't

434
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:20,800
If you don't, who pays for your bail?
 You'll go to jail. You know that?

435
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:30,320
Where are you running?
 - Don't send me to jail!

436
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:34,440
My Ma is hungry.
 Don't send me to jail!

437
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:42,760
Afraid, son? Don't be.
 This is just your first step

438
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:46,080
The road ahead is very long

439
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:37,960
Hey, are you mad?

440
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:40,640
Why are you laughing at your bread?

441
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:45,120
This bread...

442
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,640
you know this bread?
 She makes you dance

443
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:51,520
What do you mean?
 - She made me dance!

444
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:56,440
Outside the jail twelve years ago,
 had I found her...

445
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:59,200
would I be here time and again,
 for her sake?

446
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:02,920
You've had enough for free.
 Come on, the jailer is calling you

447
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:06,080
Your time's up. Find yourself
 some other hotel

448
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:07,160
Time up?
 - Yes

449
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:09,520
I don't think I like the food here
 anyway. From now on...

450
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,160
it's Hotel Taj Mahal for me

451
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:14,520
If you want to eat at
 the Taj Mahal Hotel, stop thieving

452
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:16,760
Stop picking pockets

453
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:20,160
And do some honest work
 - Sure. I'm going on a pilgrimage.

454
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,680
"I'm a tramp"

455
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:51,040
"Whether I'm rising or falling,
 I'm always a star"

456
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,920
"I have no family, no home"

457
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:24,040
"I have no one who loves me"

458
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:35,080
"I don't have a lover waiting for me
 across some river"

459
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:40,200
"For me the city is empty city
 The unknown path is all I love"

460
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:41,800
"I'm a tramp"

461
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:09,280
"I'm not rich"

462
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,880
"I'd rather stay a pauper"

463
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:15,520
"But the songs I sing
 are merry songs"

464
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:18,360
"My heart is full of wounds"

465
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:21,440
"But my eyes are always
 full of smiles"

466
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:26,920
"Oh this world"

467
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:35,240
"In this world, maybe I'm doomed"

468
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,160
"I'm a tramp"

469
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:47,600
"But whether I'm rising or I'm falling,
 I'm always a star"

470
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:37,320
Raj! You had me scared

471
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:39,560
Come on, give me a hug

472
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:49,280
Hey, are you talking English?
 - This time in jail...

473
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:51,560
I came across one of the politicos.
 I thought I'd make the most of it

474
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:54,600
And got to talk some English.
 I could use it

475
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:57,240
Tell me, what news of Ma?
 You told her, didn't you?

476
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:01,880
Yes, a long time ago. She thinks
 you're away on a long business trip...

477
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:07,720
with your boss. When you go home,
 you must go home in style

478
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:11,480
I have it all fixed.
 - First, tell me...

479
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:17,240
have you been sending money to Ma?
 - Of course! On the 1st of every month!

480
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:20,200
Say, you'd need some money,
 wouldn't you? Keep this

481
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:25,080
Looking for this thing?

482
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:28,000
I guessed it was for me.
 So why not take it for myself?

483
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:30,080
Want a ten or a twenty? No...?

484
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:34,600
Bravo, my boy! You'll make
 your guru proud someday

485
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:47,600
And someday, I'll ask your father what
 the gentleman's son grows up to be

486
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:05,240
Raj, I've been dying to see you!
 This time, it has been a whole year!

487
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:08,040
Where has this boss of yours
 been taking you to?

488
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:11,080
This time, I've been
 to London and more

489
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:12,640
London?

490
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:20,200
On my way back, I even stopped
 at Arthur Road

491
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:24,520
My boss is into import and export.
 - What's that?

492
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:29,840
You don't know import-export?
 You're so naive

493
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:33,480
Your son is about to become a big
 businessman, and you don't know...

494
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:36,600
what import-export is?
 Listen to this, Ma

495
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:43,720
import-export means moving the money
 between here and there

496
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:47,440
But mostly, it comes in this way

497
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:51,480
How would I know?
 You've even started talking English

498
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:54,560
Sit, I'll get tea for you

499
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:22,680
What are you looking at?

500
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:25,280
I'm a thief

501
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:27,960
A lying thief

502
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,080
I've sinned

503
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:38,920
Why did you turn that photo over?

504
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:49,920
Whenever I look at it,
 she seems to be staring at me

505
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,360
She brings back childhood memories.
 Why don't you admit that?

506
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,520
Where could she be now?
 Why don't you try to locate her?

507
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:04,400
Childhood days, and childhood friends
 ...do they ever come back, Ma?

508
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:08,040
I'm going out
 - But your tea?

509
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:10,080
Forget it. I've got to see a friend

510
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:12,640
My son he is! Silly boy!

511
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:54,360
"This is a colorful season"

512
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:01,520
"Men think it's exciting
 to see me tonight on the sly"

513
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:02,560
"Exciting!"

514
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:39,840
"This youth is so exciting"

515
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:43,080
"Your girl is mad about you"

516
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:29,280
"Why do you refuse me?"

517
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:32,800
"Why do you look away from me?"

518
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:36,480
"Look here, the world is yours"

519
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:42,920
"Why are you afraid of love?"

520
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:15,400
How much did you make today?
 - Ten thousand five hundred

521
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:27,520
Why only fifty-fifty?
 You can have many times more

522
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:29,800
How?
 - Tomorrow morning...

523
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,600
a bank is being inaugurated.
 Say, haws the opportunity?

524
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:36,120
A sleight of hand, and there's
 a hundred thousand or so going

525
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:38,360
All you need is a car.
 - Car?

526
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:41,920
A good car.
 - For me, that's a sleight of hand

527
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:44,880
Eleven tomorrow. I'll tell you where

528
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:49,880
Good! Someday, you'll surely
 make me proud

529
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:12,760
It's late

530
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:15,480
You have to make it by eleven

531
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:17,880
First class car!

532
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:20,160
Car? Where?

533
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:21,320
Out there

534
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:24,160
Who's driving it?
 - No idea

535
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:26,440
A girl just got down
 and walked into that shop

536
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:28,520
Keys?
 - With her, maybe

537
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:32,440
That one?

538
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,120
Can't you see?

539
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:07,320
No keys here

540
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,760
Return the bag.
 - What for?

541
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:13,800
It will make things easier.
 We'll make it work.

542
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:15,400
How will you return it?

543
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:21,200
What happened?
 - I've been robbed!

544
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:22,640
Who did it?
 - I didn't notice

545
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:24,560
He was with you!

546
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:28,040
I had it a moment ago
 - You didn't notice who robbed you?

547
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:30,080
Had I noticed, I would've caught him!

548
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:32,680
You...

549
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:34,160
Yes you!
 - Who me?

550
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:37,800
Look, there goes the thief!
 Stop! Thief!

551
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:52,200
He jumped over the wall!

552
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:54,400
Wait here

553
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:58,600
Come on, help me

554
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:07,560
There you are! Hiding!

555
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:18,360
Aren't you ashamed? Give it to me.
 Else, I'll beat you to pulp

556
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:22,120
I'm going to kill you! Give me!

557
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:40,640
You dare stare at me like that?

558
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:48,800
Hey... knife!

559
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:10,120
Are you running away? Coward!

560
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:12,200
Coward!

561
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:20,840
He ran away

562
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:24,800
Anyway, here's your purse

563
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:26,360
Keep it

564
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:29,240
You've been through so much
 trouble for my sake

565
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:36,480
No trouble. I've taken more

566
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:42,200
I should apologize. You risked
 your life to get my purse back

567
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:44,520
And I suspected you

568
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:47,400
Not your fault

569
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:49,120
It's just my looks

570
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:51,520
Sometimes even the police
 are mistaken

571
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:53,160
Bye

572
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:58,720
How was the show?
 - No use

573
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:01,760
We'll find a car. Why worry?
 Get over to the place

574
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,480
I'll join you after a change
 of clothes

575
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:08,240
Hey Romeo! You tear your clothes
 no sooner than you see a girl!

576
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:09,320
Get lost

577
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:11,040
Get going

578
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:39,200
Stop! Thief!

579
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:35,840
Where are you going?

580
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:38,600
Inside

581
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:43,200
Inside? What do you want?
 - Strange question

582
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:46,120
Your boss is the one who called me.
 And you ask me what I want?

583
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:48,040
The boss, or the lady? Who called you?

584
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:50,120
Yes, the lady

585
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:52,520
So you're the one
 who fixes the piano?

586
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:55,280
Yes! The piano fixer!

587
01:03:57,040 --> 01:03:58,520
Is the piano in there?
 - Are pianos kept outside?

588
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:01,000
No! Inside. Come on in,
 else I'll get into trouble

589
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:25,280
Looks like a billionaire's palace!

590
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:44,120
The mantle!

591
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:48,840
What a lovely mantle!

592
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:50,960
What a grand mansion!

593
01:04:57,640 --> 01:04:59,040
What kind of a joke is this?

594
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:00,600
Here's the piano

595
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:07,640
This piano is in bad shape.
 Badly damaged

596
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:14,040
Rotten! Itll take me time to fix it.
 Go on, get back to work

597
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:15,960
I'll fix it

598
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:39,240
Who's playing my piano?

599
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:45,640
You...?
 - You...!

600
01:05:58,240 --> 01:05:59,880
I'm mistaken, once again

601
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:02,400
I thought it must be a thief

602
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:04,680
That's what I am.
 - What?

603
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:08,520
I mean, who else but a thief
 would come in uninvited?

604
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:10,960
No, it's good of you
 to have come

605
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:14,720
You did me a favor.
 I should've called you over

606
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:19,160
But I didn't know your address.
 How did you find out my address?

607
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:26,920
No, don't ask me that.
 It's a secret

608
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:29,800
Let's say, it's luck that has led me
 to your doorstep

609
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:31,520
Please be seated

610
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:52,920
No, thanks

611
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:54,600
Matches

612
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:57,920
Madam, he's the piano-fixer...
 - Piano fixer?

613
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:00,320
Your servant thinks I'm here
 to fix the piano

614
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:01,680
But you said...

615
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:05,160
Never mind, take the call. Go on

616
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:10,400
Strange fellow. He took you
 for a piano mechanic

617
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:14,920
Not his fault.
 It's just my looks

618
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:18,040
Inspector sahib, no thief
 came in here

619
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:19,640
Please wait here

620
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:23,320
What brings the police here?

621
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:25,080
Excuse me, I'll be back

622
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:32,680
A car thief has sneaked into one
 of the houses in this neighborhood

623
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:37,000
Have you seen anyone?
 - No, no one came in here

624
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:40,680
She's wrong about
 no one coming in here

625
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:45,040
I happen to be a visitor.
 Would you be looking for me?

626
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:48,880
No... how could this be?

627
01:07:51,560 --> 01:07:52,480
Come

628
01:07:56,360 --> 01:07:57,680
Grand house

629
01:07:58,080 --> 01:07:59,560
Yes. It belongs to the Judge

630
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:02,160
Judge...?
 - Yes, he's my guardian

631
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:06,760
Like the guard on the train
 ...signaling red and green?

632
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:10,440
No. After my father passed away,
 I have been his ward

633
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:13,440
For the sake of my education,
 he left Lucknow and he came to Bombay

634
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:15,600
I am much obliged to him

635
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:22,600
Do judges sport such grand houses?
 He must be making a pile on the side

636
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:25,520
What a thing to say!
 The judge is very principled

637
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:27,960
He never spares criminals

638
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:30,000
I hope God spares him!

639
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:36,240
Not to worry. If you're ever arraigned
 in his court, let me defend your case

640
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:38,920
You... lawyer?
 - Yes

641
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,800
I took you for a schoolgirl

642
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:49,560
That was a nice one. A couple
 of months, and I'll be an advocate

643
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:51,160
Would you like to see my degree?

644
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:58,000
A judge lives here. And a lawyer too.
 Leaves only one to make a full court!

645
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:01,040
Yours truly. And here I am.
 - And what are you up to?

646
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:02,280
Thievery

647
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:05,800
Stealing, picking pockets, locks,
 ladies' purses, like yours...

648
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:08,320
that's what I'm up to.
 - You're joking again. Be seated

649
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:12,640
You don't think I'm a thief?
 - No, I think you're a gentleman

650
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:19,360
This is the new world order!
 The thieves, the hoodwinkers...

651
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:22,440
they all dress in first class suits
 like I'm wearing, and we take them...

652
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:27,040
for gentlemen. But those who work hard
 for an honest living and dress shabbily

653
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:31,720
...are labeled tramps and wastrels.
 The capitalists, the black marketers...

654
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:35,680
the profiteers, the usurers...
 who are they? Thieves, like I am!

655
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:40,120
You sound like a stock broker
 or a banker

656
01:09:41,480 --> 01:09:43,560
You might say that give and take
 of money is what I'm concerned with

657
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:45,920
As far as banks are concerned,
 I visit banks regularly

658
01:09:46,840 --> 01:09:47,720
Be seated

659
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:52,040
Tell me your name

660
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:13,640
Tell me, whose photo is this?
 - Mine

661
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:23,600
You...?

662
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:26,000
Yes, when I was young

663
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:28,280
It's a birthday photo

664
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:30,320
Your name?

665
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:32,440
Rita. Why?

666
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:44,840
Ms Rita, would you like to come
 to my house?

667
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:48,080
I'd like to show you
 something unique

668
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:53,400
My mother would be very pleased
 to meet you. Come

669
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:12,560
You...?

670
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:16,080
After twelve years

671
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:23,200
You've changed!

672
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:26,280
You haven't changed at all

673
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:31,840
Where have you been, Raj?

674
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:34,920
Looking for you

675
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:39,200
And at last, I've found you
 - And when I saw you...

676
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:41,320
I took you for a thief

677
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:46,400
Not your fault.
 It's in my looks

678
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:36,840
"Ever since my lover
 has come home..."

679
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:39,360
"my heart leaps with joy"

680
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:02,920
"His heart said
 something to mine"

681
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:06,720
"And the old days returned"

682
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:10,480
"Our days have returned again"

683
01:13:11,080 --> 01:13:13,760
"He brings so much of happiness..."

684
01:13:14,120 --> 01:13:16,320
"my heart leaps with joy"

685
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:39,880
"My heart he could win
 through my eyes"

686
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:43,480
"I could lay the stars
 at his feet"

687
01:13:48,280 --> 01:13:53,320
"My hopes soar...
 my heart leaps with joy"

688
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:56,720
"Ever since my beloved
 has come home..."

689
01:13:57,080 --> 01:13:59,160
"my heart leaps with joy"

690
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:16,840
"We are young
 and we are in love"

691
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:20,760
"He is the one who
 makes my world"

692
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:30,440
"My heart leads him to me...
 my heart leaps with joy"

693
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:36,480
"Ever since my hero has returned,
 my heart springs to life"

694
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:45,120
The Judge is here

695
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:49,400
So here you are. And you're late

696
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:53,720
The doctor has told you to come home
 and rest for at least an hour

697
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:57,640
But you won't listen.
 You look so tired

698
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:02,040
Just sit here. I'll get you
 your dressing gown

699
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:06,080
Tell me, where have you been
 all this time?

700
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:10,120
I had a lecture in the law college.
 I went there directly from the court

701
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:13,440
All that jabbering
 is giving me a headache

702
01:15:15,480 --> 01:15:19,360
That's bound to happen. The doctor
 told you to eat before eight

703
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:22,520
It's nine thirty now

704
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:26,520
Listen to that! Even the clock
 is angry with you

705
01:15:30,240 --> 01:15:31,200
Come on

706
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:52,640
Tell me about yourself. What have
 you been up to all evening?

707
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:58,400
You look as if you've found
 a treasure

708
01:16:00,040 --> 01:16:03,240
You could say that. A long-lost friend
 is no less than a treasure

709
01:16:04,040 --> 01:16:07,000
You'll be glad when you meet Raj.
 You're certain to like him!

710
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:20,480
Who is this Mr. Raj? Where does he live?
 What does he do? What's his family name?

711
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:24,320
He's a childhood friend.
 We were in school together

712
01:16:25,640 --> 01:16:27,520
I'm seeing him after twelve years!

713
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:29,640
After twelve years?

714
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:33,640
After so many years,
 most people change

715
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:37,600
Raj has changed too. At school,
 he used to be very quiet

716
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:40,520
Now he has great sense of humor.
 When I asked him what he's up to...

717
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:42,400
he said he's a thief

718
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:45,360
Maybe that wasn't a joke?

719
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:47,840
I don't follow you

720
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:49,760
Never mind

721
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:52,680
You know what young men
 are like, these days

722
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:57,720
Who knows, they might steal
 something valuable

723
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:33,160
The water is deep.
 You might drown

724
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:37,480
Not without you

725
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:38,720
Is that so?

726
01:18:39,080 --> 01:18:40,160
Try that

727
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:43,080
Is that so?

728
01:19:05,320 --> 01:19:07,280
Hey lady, haven't you finished
 dressing yet?

729
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:11,440
Where are you headed?
 Gentlemen don't barge in...

730
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:14,920
when ladies are changing dresses.
 Don't you know that?

731
01:19:15,560 --> 01:19:17,240
How would I know?

732
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:26,560
I'm no gentleman

733
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:30,480
Savage

734
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:37,760
I'm not about to give in
 to your type

735
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:43,240
Where are you running away?

736
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:47,600
Let go of my hand. What kind
 of a stupid joke is this?

737
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:49,960
You savage!

738
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:51,360
Am I...?
 - Yes!

739
01:19:51,560 --> 01:19:53,120
You're a savage!
 - Savage?

740
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:55,320
I'm a penniless, uneducated tramp!

741
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:57,640
I don't fit into high society!

742
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:00,360
How dare I maul your fragile body
 with my beastly hands

743
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:02,600
I told Ma that childhood friends,
 like childhood days are gone...

744
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:04,320
never to return

745
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:07,760
Good of you to have told me
 my class

746
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:11,400
It was a joke. Don't get angry

747
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:16,040
You want to hit me? Go ahead

748
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:27,560
Whom will I hit?

749
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:30,600
You...?

750
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:34,840
Or myself...?

751
01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:17,280
Are you happy?

752
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:23,040
Where are you lost?

753
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:24,960
Up there

754
01:21:26,040 --> 01:21:27,160
Come back

755
01:21:27,640 --> 01:21:28,800
Where to?

756
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:30,720
Beside me

757
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:33,000
Why?

758
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:34,600
No reason

759
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:45,440
Aren't you ashamed?

760
01:21:52,680 --> 01:21:54,000
What are you looking at?

761
01:21:54,520 --> 01:21:55,640
The Moon?

762
01:21:58,200 --> 01:21:59,120
No

763
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:00,520
Clouds

764
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:04,840
What's your problem?
 You don't see the Moon...

765
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:07,280
and you see the dark clouds?
 Won't you tell me?

766
01:22:09,880 --> 01:22:11,480
Who else can I tell?

767
01:22:16,040 --> 01:22:17,760
We're seeing each other
 after twelve years

768
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:24,760
A lot changes in twelve years.
 - The Judge said that too!

769
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:28,440
But I don't agree. Look at us.
 We're still friends

770
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:34,440
The Judge is right.
 You know nothing about me

771
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:36,760
Who I am...

772
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:39,240
my circumstances...

773
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:42,440
my family background...

774
01:22:43,720 --> 01:22:45,200
what I have been doing...

775
01:22:45,640 --> 01:22:46,920
what I am doing

776
01:22:48,040 --> 01:22:49,640
You know nothing about me

777
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:52,280
Nor do I want to know

778
01:22:54,280 --> 01:22:58,720
All I know is that you are
 the one I...

779
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:05,720
Rita, you are so nice.
 But so naive

780
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:07,720
And you're such a fool

781
01:23:08,280 --> 01:23:09,240
A savage

782
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:11,080
I'm not talking to you

783
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:13,560
Look

784
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:16,280
The clouds?

785
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:19,840
They are moving away from my Moon

786
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:23,600
You know, today's my birthday

787
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:28,400
Which? Tenth? Eleventh?

788
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:30,800
You don't ask a lady that

789
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:33,000
All right, I'll whisper it to you

790
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:35,240
Twenty one

791
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:38,120
No! It's looking at us

792
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:40,240
What?
 - That!

793
01:23:56,440 --> 01:24:06,640
"I wish the Moon would
 look away for a while..."

794
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:10,240
"while I make love to him"

795
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:13,560
"I'd say a thousand sweet nothings"

796
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:50,600
"I pray with all my heart..."

797
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:54,480
"I pray for my love"

798
01:24:55,000 --> 01:25:00,680
"The Moon watches me and
 my beloved for the first time"

799
01:25:00,920 --> 01:25:04,560
"On our first night together"

800
01:25:04,840 --> 01:25:11,480
"Hide behind those clouds,
 O Moon..."

801
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:15,000
"while I make love to him"

802
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:18,440
"While I say a thousand
 sweet nothings to him"

803
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:32,080
"I wish the Moon would
 look this way for while..."

804
01:25:32,680 --> 01:25:35,560
"I'd make love to her"

805
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:39,200
"I'd look deep into her eyes"

806
01:25:58,480 --> 01:26:01,640
"I'm a thief;
 I steal"

807
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:05,760
"I have a bad reputation"

808
01:26:06,120 --> 01:26:11,960
"I have always stolen hearts;
 that's just what I have done"

809
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:22,520
"You must bear witness, O Moon"

810
01:26:22,840 --> 01:26:26,120
"While I make love to her"

811
01:26:26,280 --> 01:26:29,440
"When I look into her eyes"

812
01:26:49,320 --> 01:26:52,640
"You have stolen my heart;
 do not go away"

813
01:26:52,960 --> 01:26:55,840
"Do not forget the path
 that leads to me"

814
01:26:56,200 --> 01:27:03,000
"Do not trample upon the rose
 that is my heart"

815
01:27:06,160 --> 01:27:12,760
"Tell him this much, O Moon..."

816
01:27:13,040 --> 01:27:16,000
"I'll make love to him"

817
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:19,560
"I'll whisper a thousand
 sweet nothings to him"

818
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:26,440
"If only you look this way,
 O Moon..."

819
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:33,840
"I'd make love to her;
 I'd look deep into her eyes"

820
01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:41,280
"If only you looked away
 for a while, O Moon..."

821
01:27:55,360 --> 01:27:57,400
One step more, and the boat
 will turn over and sink

822
01:27:58,760 --> 01:27:59,880
Say what...?

823
01:28:07,160 --> 01:28:08,600
Let the boat sink

824
01:28:47,720 --> 01:28:49,760
I don't want it
 - But the doctor says...

825
01:28:50,520 --> 01:28:52,360
I should eat by eight

826
01:29:07,640 --> 01:29:09,480
Tonight, it's my turn
 to be admonished by the clock

827
01:29:18,640 --> 01:29:20,320
You are angry with me, aren't you?

828
01:29:33,240 --> 01:29:35,400
Today I was...

829
01:29:35,680 --> 01:29:37,400
With Raj?
 - Raj is no stranger

830
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:39,480
He's a childhood friend

831
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:52,040
I made a promise
 to your dying father

832
01:29:52,840 --> 01:29:54,720
To take care of you
 as long as I live

833
01:29:55,920 --> 01:29:57,280
You must make a promise

834
01:29:58,480 --> 01:30:03,360
If someone likes you,
 if you like someone...

835
01:30:04,520 --> 01:30:06,560
you will not give your consent
 without telling me

836
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:10,960
I know, I am much obliged to you.

837
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:14,040
But it doesn't mean that you can,
 time and again...

838
01:30:45,480 --> 01:30:46,400
Boss...?

839
01:30:47,880 --> 01:30:50,960
Recognize me?
 Thank you very much!

840
01:30:51,560 --> 01:30:53,720
You haven't much time nowadays

841
01:30:55,240 --> 01:30:58,440
Well son, are you falling in love?

842
01:30:59,080 --> 01:31:02,080
Or, have you given up your profession
 for fear of going to jail?

843
01:31:04,600 --> 01:31:06,800
You don't know the size of the scam
 I've planned for you

844
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:10,760
She's an heiress.
 Just wait for a few days

845
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:15,440
I'm angling for a diamond necklace.
 - Bravo!

846
01:31:16,360 --> 01:31:20,280
I knew it! You aren't the type
 to waste your time

847
01:31:22,120 --> 01:31:23,200
But remember!

848
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:28,320
If you try to cheat Jagga...

849
01:31:54,760 --> 01:32:01,240
"Nor do I want to know. All I know
 is that you are the one I..."

850
01:32:03,240 --> 01:32:04,120
Really...?

851
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:10,000
"Remember! If you try
 to cheat Jagga..."

852
01:34:30,280 --> 01:34:35,480
"Without you, even Moonlight
 is a scorching fire..."

853
01:34:35,880 --> 01:34:38,280
"Come to me"

854
01:34:53,280 --> 01:34:57,760
"Like a flute bereft of melody..."

855
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:03,560
"without you, my life is a misery"

856
01:35:04,320 --> 01:35:06,760
"Come to me"

857
01:36:01,680 --> 01:36:06,240
"This is no life...
 no, this isn't"

858
01:36:20,920 --> 01:36:25,160
"In the pyre that is my life,
 I burn alive"

859
01:36:25,480 --> 01:36:29,520
"Like red-hot arrows
 tears of anguish rip me apart"

860
01:36:45,960 --> 01:36:48,920
"I want not this hell..."

861
01:36:49,160 --> 01:36:53,000
"I seek only roses,
 I seek only love"

862
01:36:53,320 --> 01:36:59,040
"A season of Spring, I seek"

863
01:38:14,760 --> 01:38:19,280
"My lover has come home"

864
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:23,760
"My thirsting eyes are sated"

865
01:38:33,080 --> 01:38:37,360
"You are the pearl
 deep inside my heart"

866
01:38:42,360 --> 01:38:46,240
"You are the light of my eyes"

867
01:38:51,280 --> 01:38:55,680
"You are all my childhood fantasies
 were about"

868
01:38:55,960 --> 01:39:00,120
"And now you are back"

869
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:13,720
"Don't break my heart now;
 don't go away"

870
01:39:18,440 --> 01:39:23,040
"Don't leave me in tears"

871
01:39:27,720 --> 01:39:31,920
"I beseech you"

872
01:41:21,720 --> 01:41:22,600
Ma!

873
01:41:23,400 --> 01:41:25,120
Help me, Ma!

874
01:41:27,160 --> 01:41:29,880
Ma, I want to be good!

875
01:41:30,320 --> 01:41:33,000
I promise, I won't have anything to do
 with Jagga and those others!

876
01:41:33,120 --> 01:41:36,840
I'd rather starve than steal.
 I will be good

877
01:41:37,040 --> 01:41:40,160
People will say I'm honest!
 Let's go back to our slum

878
01:41:40,360 --> 01:41:44,120
I'll work hard for a living.
 I won't steal! Ma, I won't steal!

879
01:41:45,160 --> 01:41:47,960
I want nothing but peace of mind,
 and my mother's blessings

880
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:52,440
I won't steal, Ma.
 I'll become honest

881
01:42:37,880 --> 01:42:41,600
Yes, sir?
 - You're fired. We won't need you

882
01:42:44,600 --> 01:42:46,320
We don't employ thieves

883
01:42:50,760 --> 01:42:55,800
May I ask something, sir? You say
 you don't want to employ thieves?

884
01:42:56,760 --> 01:42:59,760
Would you rather that they keep
 thieving all their lives?

885
01:43:20,240 --> 01:43:21,320
Fired?

886
01:43:22,280 --> 01:43:23,720
Come on, the boss is calling you

887
01:43:25,480 --> 01:43:27,000
Raj, what reply do I carry back
 to the boss?

888
01:43:27,120 --> 01:43:28,160
This

889
01:43:31,640 --> 01:43:33,600
He will either steal
 or he will starve

890
01:43:33,800 --> 01:43:38,000
And how long will he not steal?
 He has no way out of crime

891
01:43:38,440 --> 01:43:40,040
Let me see how far he goes

892
01:43:52,840 --> 01:43:54,400
Where are you going?

893
01:43:57,560 --> 01:44:00,640
To see Rita.
 - You can't go in. The Judge's orders

894
01:44:03,440 --> 01:44:04,920
The Judge's orders?

895
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,480
Then go and tell her that
 Raj is waiting out here to see her

896
01:44:13,840 --> 01:44:19,720
I have much to tell her.
 - She can't see anyone. Get going

897
01:44:25,280 --> 01:44:29,520
Get going...? Where to?

898
01:44:52,360 --> 01:44:53,440
Come friend

899
01:44:56,280 --> 01:44:57,760
Let me talk to you

900
01:45:00,040 --> 01:45:06,760
Strange coincidence, isn't it?
 You're a tramp, I'm a tramp too

901
01:45:08,880 --> 01:45:12,680
You have no name,
 I have no name either

902
01:45:15,560 --> 01:45:20,160
You are homeless,
 I have no home either

903
01:45:22,680 --> 01:45:24,640
Like me, you too crave for love

904
01:45:26,160 --> 01:45:28,800
Difference being only that
 you are an animal, and I'm human

905
01:45:31,920 --> 01:45:32,840
Human

906
01:45:40,360 --> 01:45:42,360
I have nothing to give you

907
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:45,400
I can only give love

908
01:45:57,680 --> 01:46:00,520
Why don't you watch your step?
 Are you blind?

909
01:46:00,840 --> 01:46:03,880
Mind your tongue.
 Bloody savage

910
01:46:15,720 --> 01:46:18,440
Savage... am I a savage?

911
01:46:18,920 --> 01:46:23,080
Am I a mongrel on the streets?
 To be kicked at will or whim?

912
01:47:23,880 --> 01:47:24,840
"Piano-fixer?"

913
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,080
"Your servant thinks
 I'm here to fix the piano"

914
01:47:37,280 --> 01:47:41,480
"Come to me, I pine for you"

915
01:47:46,120 --> 01:47:50,440
"The night is about to pass"

916
01:47:55,560 --> 01:47:59,760
"I pine here;
 you long there"

917
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:04,320
"So come...
 the night is about to pass"

918
01:48:16,400 --> 01:48:21,280
"Even the Moon is waning"

919
01:48:22,640 --> 01:48:28,080
"The stars are disappearing"

920
01:48:34,240 --> 01:48:43,360
"A painful, restless hour;
 the night passes"

921
01:49:04,080 --> 01:49:08,560
"Carried away with the Moon..."

922
01:49:08,840 --> 01:49:13,600
"I see the bride-like night
 disappearing"

923
01:49:20,080 --> 01:49:24,480
"Call out to me...
 where are you?"

924
01:49:24,720 --> 01:49:29,080
"The night is passing"

925
01:49:49,960 --> 01:49:54,240
"I fear and I lose hope"

926
01:49:54,840 --> 01:50:03,480
"Even my fate is tiring of me"

927
01:50:06,280 --> 01:50:08,120
"If you won't come..."

928
01:50:08,360 --> 01:50:10,640
"where do I go?"

929
01:50:10,880 --> 01:50:15,200
"The night is about to pass"

930
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:29,720
The invitations have been printed

931
01:51:33,080 --> 01:51:34,920
The day after tomorrow
 is your birthday, isn't it?

932
01:51:36,200 --> 01:51:39,200
Send them to the friends
 you want to invite

933
01:51:43,800 --> 01:51:45,480
All my friends?

934
01:51:55,920 --> 01:51:59,520
Yes, all friends. All, who are
 worthy of being your friends

935
01:52:14,440 --> 01:52:15,800
Your birthday

936
01:52:22,400 --> 01:52:25,400
"Raj, aren't you giving me a gift?"

937
01:52:26,120 --> 01:52:29,720
"I didn't have money to buy anything.
 I'll give you some other time"

938
01:52:29,960 --> 01:52:32,680
"Must you only buy something
 to make a gift?"

939
01:52:33,920 --> 01:52:35,360
"You can give me a flower"

940
01:52:36,040 --> 01:52:38,720
"Someday, I'm going to make
 lots of money"

941
01:52:38,920 --> 01:52:42,040
"And I'll buy a gift for you.
 Something better than all this"

942
01:52:56,360 --> 01:53:00,640
Back? I knew someday,
 you'd surely come back

943
01:53:01,160 --> 01:53:04,120
For you, this is the only door open

944
01:53:04,760 --> 01:53:09,600
I need a thousand. A loan
 I'll return it after I've earned it

945
01:53:10,600 --> 01:53:14,440
Loan? What do you think I am,
 a money-lender?

946
01:53:15,240 --> 01:53:21,560
Today is Rita's birthday.
 Look, she has invited me

947
01:53:23,080 --> 01:53:27,320
She takes me for a gentleman.
 - So you must dress like a gentleman

948
01:53:27,720 --> 01:53:31,640
And to prove yourself, you must
 also make a gift to the lady

949
01:53:35,720 --> 01:53:40,200
So gentlemanliness is for sale,
 and you intend buying some?

950
01:53:40,400 --> 01:53:45,720
But to become a gentleman, you need
 money. One thousand Rupees

951
01:53:46,240 --> 01:53:51,520
For that thousand, you have to steal,
 rob, or maybe even kill someone for me

952
01:53:52,720 --> 01:53:54,520
Do you accept?
 - No

953
01:53:55,600 --> 01:53:59,880
No! I won't rob!
 I won't commit crimes!

954
01:54:00,120 --> 01:54:01,640
What other way out have you?

955
01:54:05,200 --> 01:54:10,040
Once a criminal, you can never
 become a gentleman again!

956
01:54:10,240 --> 01:54:11,720
No matter how many times
 you change your clothes

957
01:54:13,160 --> 01:54:17,480
Crime is written all over your face!
 You even tried working

958
01:54:17,800 --> 01:54:20,600
Not for you, the bread
 in the sweat of thy face

959
01:54:20,840 --> 01:54:24,440
For you, the only resort
 is thieving, crime

960
01:54:24,840 --> 01:54:27,440
Same as mine!

961
01:54:29,880 --> 01:54:31,640
All thanks to your father

962
01:55:27,280 --> 01:55:28,800
Watch your step, son

963
01:55:30,040 --> 01:55:32,280
I try. But what to do?
 Out on the streets...

964
01:55:32,480 --> 01:55:36,680
there are those big guns like you.
 - Sharp, are you?

965
01:56:20,360 --> 01:56:21,720
Have you seen Rita?

966
01:57:19,120 --> 01:57:20,800
Tell me something
 #NAME?

967
01:57:22,720 --> 01:57:24,000
Who are you looking for?

968
01:57:27,800 --> 01:57:29,080
Want me to tell you?

969
01:57:30,600 --> 01:57:32,000
Look, over there

970
01:57:53,200 --> 01:57:54,560
So you came

971
01:57:56,520 --> 01:57:57,920
Happy twenty-first

972
01:58:05,480 --> 01:58:08,160
Your gift
 - Why did you have to do this?

973
01:58:09,320 --> 01:58:11,360
Why did you have to buy
 such an expensive necklace?

974
01:58:12,880 --> 01:58:18,160
For you, nothing is too expensive.
 Besides, I stole it

975
01:58:18,920 --> 01:58:22,760
You stole it?
 - I stole it from the stars

976
01:58:23,840 --> 01:58:26,840
You're such a...
 - A savage?

977
01:58:27,080 --> 01:58:29,080
What else? You are a savage

978
01:58:30,160 --> 01:58:32,840
You buy this expensive gift...

979
01:58:33,160 --> 01:58:36,480
but you won't spend
 for a velvet case

980
01:58:37,160 --> 01:58:38,640
Case?

981
01:58:40,880 --> 01:58:42,840
Rita, the Judge is calling you.
 Hurry up

982
01:58:50,360 --> 01:58:51,680
What's on your mind?

983
01:58:56,040 --> 01:58:57,520
Let me introduce you to the Judge

984
01:58:59,880 --> 01:59:00,920
Come on

985
01:59:25,880 --> 01:59:27,840
Rita, I've been waiting for you

986
01:59:28,800 --> 01:59:30,240
First, my present

987
01:59:30,600 --> 01:59:33,600
See if you like it

988
01:59:38,640 --> 01:59:40,320
Why, don't you like it?

989
01:59:42,160 --> 01:59:45,720
Today's a strange day. Someone
 gives me a necklace sans a case

990
01:59:45,960 --> 01:59:48,000
And someone give me a case
 sans the necklace

991
02:00:18,280 --> 02:00:21,200
"The man I'm in love with
 is full of deceit"

992
02:00:21,360 --> 02:00:23,840
"But I've fallen in love with him?"

993
02:00:24,040 --> 02:00:28,600
"Oh, what have I done?"

994
02:00:50,360 --> 02:00:52,840
"He looked so innocent"

995
02:00:53,120 --> 02:00:55,640
"But he turns out to be a crook"

996
02:00:55,840 --> 02:00:58,200
"The innocent-looking crook
 that he is..."

997
02:00:58,400 --> 02:01:00,760
"he's a blackheart
 with a sunny smile"

998
02:01:11,320 --> 02:01:16,840
"I have given him my heart
 I'm driving myself crazy"

999
02:01:17,080 --> 02:01:21,480
"Oh, what am I doing?"

1000
02:01:50,280 --> 02:01:57,800
"Those blue eyes have deceived me"

1001
02:01:58,440 --> 02:02:03,000
"There's an emptiness inside my heart
 and tears come to my eyes"

1002
02:02:05,800 --> 02:02:11,520
"I trusted him
 I promised him my love"

1003
02:02:11,760 --> 02:02:16,160
"Oh, what have I done?"

1004
02:02:44,800 --> 02:02:49,240
What have I done?
 I've fallen in love with a thief!

1005
02:02:51,120 --> 02:02:52,520
And Raju, you...?

1006
02:03:07,440 --> 02:03:09,040
Is it some gift you don't like?

1007
02:03:14,480 --> 02:03:16,480
I'm going to return his gift

1008
02:03:23,560 --> 02:03:28,400
Bring him over.
 I'd like to meet him

1009
02:03:49,640 --> 02:03:52,480
Raj isn't a bad boy.
 He has just gone astray

1010
02:03:53,360 --> 02:03:58,040
All he needs is someone to love him,
 to support him, to bring him around

1011
02:03:59,400 --> 02:04:04,280
He respects you. If you want it,
 Raj can be saved

1012
02:04:05,160 --> 02:04:08,640
Is Raj not at home?
 - No. He went out early in the morning

1013
02:04:08,840 --> 02:04:10,160
He isn't back yet

1014
02:04:35,240 --> 02:04:40,360
"Falling in love with you, my love"

1015
02:04:40,600 --> 02:04:45,400
"I have cried, and I have laughed"

1016
02:04:50,840 --> 02:05:00,680
"Happily I have borne
 the pangs of love"

1017
02:05:00,920 --> 02:05:11,520
"I have cried, and I have laughed"

1018
02:05:19,080 --> 02:05:26,240
"What do you know of
 the pangs of love?"

1019
02:05:26,720 --> 02:05:31,920
"The pain is so acute"

1020
02:05:51,760 --> 02:05:54,400
"I'm transfixed"

1021
02:05:56,880 --> 02:05:59,200
"I stood silent"

1022
02:05:59,440 --> 02:06:01,920
"I stood in silence, I swear"

1023
02:06:02,160 --> 02:06:07,000
"I cried, and I laughed"

1024
02:06:19,760 --> 02:06:27,160
"My heart burns, as if on fire"

1025
02:06:27,400 --> 02:06:32,800
"My tears flow, as it rains"

1026
02:06:52,840 --> 02:06:55,520
"Like the clouds"

1027
02:06:58,960 --> 02:07:02,880
"Like a cloud, I was a tramp"

1028
02:07:03,120 --> 02:07:12,960
"I have cried, and I have laughed"

1029
02:07:18,320 --> 02:07:23,080
"Falling in love with you, my love"

1030
02:07:23,320 --> 02:07:28,240
"I have cried, and I have laughed"

1031
02:07:42,280 --> 02:07:43,560
There you are

1032
02:07:44,840 --> 02:07:46,440
Haven't you brought the police along?

1033
02:07:46,920 --> 02:07:48,640
That bitterness is of no use

1034
02:07:50,800 --> 02:07:52,520
Your mother has told me everything

1035
02:07:55,360 --> 02:07:59,200
So you know I'm wayward
 ...Ive been to jail...

1036
02:08:00,680 --> 02:08:04,680
and my name is on the police rolls.
 Is that what you've come to tell me?

1037
02:08:05,560 --> 02:08:10,280
Try to understand me, Raj.
 I still consider you my friend

1038
02:08:11,880 --> 02:08:12,800
Friend?

1039
02:08:16,680 --> 02:08:22,880
A lawyer's daughter, a judge's ward
 takes a tramp for a friend?

1040
02:08:23,400 --> 02:08:27,080
What's your society going to say?
 What will your people say?

1041
02:08:27,320 --> 02:08:30,240
If you recant, society
 will forgive your past

1042
02:08:30,440 --> 02:08:34,400
Raj, you can make a new life
 for yourself... you can!

1043
02:08:35,200 --> 02:08:38,840
A new life? On what
 will I build a new life?

1044
02:08:39,880 --> 02:08:44,520
Can you give me back my childhood
 ...the education I never had?

1045
02:08:45,400 --> 02:08:50,120
Everyone says that I have no father
 to name... I have no honor!

1046
02:08:50,440 --> 02:08:53,840
Can you bring my father back?
 Can you give me my name?

1047
02:08:54,040 --> 02:09:00,200
Can you give me my honor?
 Tell me... tell me Rita!

1048
02:09:02,800 --> 02:09:07,360
Rita, I've kept you in the dark.
 I've kept myself in the dark

1049
02:09:08,840 --> 02:09:12,640
Forget me Rita.
 Leave me to myself

1050
02:09:13,720 --> 02:09:15,680
I am not worthy of you

1051
02:09:16,200 --> 02:09:18,040
You realize fully well,
 yet you want to live in this hell

1052
02:09:18,200 --> 02:09:20,080
I never imagined you'd be so weak

1053
02:09:21,080 --> 02:09:23,640
Rita, don't you think I never tried
 to get out of this hell

1054
02:09:24,800 --> 02:09:26,400
But tell me, what do I do?

1055
02:09:27,240 --> 02:09:29,960
For twelve years, the world
 has chased me towards crime

1056
02:09:30,760 --> 02:09:32,840
Alone, I cannot face it

1057
02:09:33,640 --> 02:09:35,600
Alone, I cannot

1058
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:40,280
You aren't alone, Raj
 Your mother is with you

1059
02:09:41,600 --> 02:09:43,160
I'm with you

1060
02:09:43,360 --> 02:09:47,040
You? With me? With a criminal?

1061
02:09:47,640 --> 02:09:50,960
Yes Raj. With you, forever

1062
02:09:52,800 --> 02:09:57,800
Good or not, guilty or not,
 whatever you are, you're mine

1063
02:10:02,280 --> 02:10:06,400
This is a matter of the heart. And
 the scales of justice cannot judge it

1064
02:10:08,440 --> 02:10:13,160
But this guilt I carry
 with me forever...?

1065
02:10:14,800 --> 02:10:17,320
For me, as your wife, it will
 be the bride's vermillion

1066
02:10:22,600 --> 02:10:23,920
Really?

1067
02:10:25,400 --> 02:10:27,320
Come with me
 - Where?

1068
02:10:28,200 --> 02:10:29,760
The Judge wants to meet you

1069
02:10:32,040 --> 02:10:33,000
The Judge...?

1070
02:10:58,120 --> 02:10:59,160
Sit

1071
02:11:08,440 --> 02:11:09,760
Name?

1072
02:11:12,520 --> 02:11:13,600
Only Raj?

1073
02:11:14,440 --> 02:11:15,360
Yes

1074
02:11:18,440 --> 02:11:20,160
Your father's name?

1075
02:11:21,920 --> 02:11:23,320
I don't know

1076
02:11:32,600 --> 02:11:33,480
I see

1077
02:11:33,760 --> 02:11:34,960
What do you do?

1078
02:11:36,280 --> 02:11:39,880
As of now, unemployed.
 Like millions of others

1079
02:11:41,160 --> 02:11:43,800
Any other source of income?
 Property?

1080
02:11:48,400 --> 02:11:49,320
Nothing

1081
02:11:49,800 --> 02:11:54,040
Do you remember polishing boots
 when you were a boy?

1082
02:11:54,760 --> 02:11:56,800
I still do

1083
02:11:57,160 --> 02:11:58,640
And you want to marry Rita?

1084
02:11:59,440 --> 02:12:01,920
Yes. If you allow me

1085
02:12:02,160 --> 02:12:05,120
And you've been to jail too?
 - Rita must've told you that...

1086
02:12:05,400 --> 02:12:08,920
You've recanted...? Have you found
 another source of making money?

1087
02:12:11,800 --> 02:12:13,600
No
 - But there's still hope, isn't it?

1088
02:12:13,840 --> 02:12:18,120
If some silly rich girl marries you...
 - Did you call me here to insult me?

1089
02:12:23,080 --> 02:12:24,640
We are in love

1090
02:12:27,160 --> 02:12:29,200
We want to marry
 - All that I've heard

1091
02:12:30,480 --> 02:12:31,400
Love!

1092
02:12:34,240 --> 02:12:35,160
Sit

1093
02:12:37,720 --> 02:12:39,480
And let's talk it over
 with a cool head

1094
02:12:40,040 --> 02:12:42,680
What do you mean?
 - I mean that though I don't know...

1095
02:12:42,880 --> 02:12:48,440
how you managed to seduce a naive girl,
 it's clear why you played this trick

1096
02:12:49,720 --> 02:12:51,960
I want to know what price
 you'll take to let her go

1097
02:13:00,640 --> 02:13:05,760
Till today, I thought
 I was the worst scoundrel on earth

1098
02:13:07,600 --> 02:13:10,240
But you turn out to be
 one up on me!

1099
02:13:10,480 --> 02:13:13,440
You scum! How dare you use
 your filthy colloquy?

1100
02:13:14,240 --> 02:13:17,080
You think I'm going to let
 Rita marry a tramp like you?

1101
02:13:17,640 --> 02:13:21,680
She'd rather stay a spinster for life.
 Better by far that she dies!

1102
02:13:23,800 --> 02:13:27,560
Why not say that you'd rather
 she married some rich big-shot?

1103
02:13:28,760 --> 02:13:32,520
Or maybe, some judge?

1104
02:13:33,120 --> 02:13:34,480
Out of here

1105
02:13:49,120 --> 02:13:50,840
Before I leave, I'd like
 to ask you a question

1106
02:13:53,160 --> 02:13:56,600
What if it was your son in my place?
 And because he's poor...

1107
02:13:56,800 --> 02:14:00,240
because he was brought up in the slums
 and was forced into crime...

1108
02:14:00,520 --> 02:14:07,000
what if it was he who was being denied
 his love, his life...?

1109
02:14:07,320 --> 02:14:09,120
How would you have felt?

1110
02:14:26,280 --> 02:14:28,000
Jagga has called you

1111
02:14:28,360 --> 02:14:30,560
There's a big heist

1112
02:14:31,200 --> 02:14:32,520
A bank is to be looted

1113
02:15:12,800 --> 02:15:13,920
Open the door!

1114
02:15:16,240 --> 02:15:18,240
Open up
 - Who is it?

1115
02:15:18,800 --> 02:15:22,080
Open up!

1116
02:15:34,840 --> 02:15:36,040
Who are you?

1117
02:15:37,640 --> 02:15:39,360
Don't you know me?

1118
02:15:41,280 --> 02:15:42,200
I'm Jagga

1119
02:15:46,880 --> 02:15:50,120
The bandit?
 - You could say so

1120
02:15:50,840 --> 02:15:52,240
What do you want here?

1121
02:15:52,800 --> 02:15:53,960
Silence!

1122
02:15:55,920 --> 02:15:58,560
The police are after me.
 Where's Raj?

1123
02:16:00,960 --> 02:16:03,680
Get out of my house! I will do nothing
 to help someone like you!

1124
02:16:09,120 --> 02:16:14,480
I had you once, and I let you go
 Remember the day?

1125
02:16:15,400 --> 02:16:20,640
For twelve years, I cared for your son.
 I made his life! For this day?

1126
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:24,480
Made my son's life?
 You forced him into crime

1127
02:16:25,360 --> 02:16:28,960
Get out of my house. I don't want
 your cursed shadow upon my son!

1128
02:16:29,200 --> 02:16:31,200
Get out! Get out of my house!

1129
02:16:37,960 --> 02:16:40,280
Go on! Call the police!

1130
02:16:40,520 --> 02:16:42,040
Let me see who saves you!

1131
02:16:42,400 --> 02:16:43,720
Scream!

1132
02:16:50,360 --> 02:16:52,000
Will you challenge your boss?

1133
02:16:52,880 --> 02:16:55,040
You're no boss. You're Satan!

1134
02:17:09,240 --> 02:17:11,480
Let's hear what you have to say now

1135
02:17:38,880 --> 02:17:40,440
No! No! Mercy!

1136
02:17:44,640 --> 02:17:46,240
No! Enough!

1137
02:18:19,560 --> 02:18:20,960
What have you done Raj?

1138
02:18:21,520 --> 02:18:23,480
For my sins, this is atonement!

1139
02:18:58,280 --> 02:18:59,840
The accused may be presented

1140
02:19:07,160 --> 02:19:08,720
What's the name of the accused?

1141
02:19:08,840 --> 02:19:10,280
Sir, his name is Raj

1142
02:19:17,440 --> 02:19:20,600
Father's name?
 - Not known, sir. Maybe he has none

1143
02:19:26,800 --> 02:19:31,680
Raj, you have been accused
 of killing Jagga

1144
02:19:32,560 --> 02:19:34,400
Do you have anything to say
 in your defense?

1145
02:19:38,080 --> 02:19:40,120
Have you not appointed a lawyer
 to defend yourself?

1146
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:51,080
The case is adjourned. The government
 will appoint a counsel for the defense

1147
02:19:51,320 --> 02:19:56,000
I know the law. Raj killed
 in self-defense. That's no crime

1148
02:19:56,720 --> 02:20:00,040
Please save my Raj, somehow

1149
02:20:00,320 --> 02:20:03,320
Your deposition is very important.
 The whole case hinges on it

1150
02:20:03,760 --> 02:20:06,400
Come to the court tomorrow
 - All right

1151
02:20:45,640 --> 02:20:49,600
Is she dead?
 - She has been hurt on the head

1152
02:20:51,280 --> 02:20:57,600
And Raj killed Jagga
 to save my life

1153
02:20:59,240 --> 02:21:02,840
Please sign here. This deposition
 will surely save Raj

1154
02:21:04,880 --> 02:21:09,760
If Raj is saved, I will be able
 to die in peace

1155
02:21:10,600 --> 02:21:11,840
I should be leaving now

1156
02:21:25,960 --> 02:21:27,800
My son!
 - What happened to you, Ma?

1157
02:21:28,840 --> 02:21:32,720
That heartless judge has killed you!
 What is his enmity with us?

1158
02:21:32,960 --> 02:21:35,120
You mustn't blame him, son.
 - Why not?

1159
02:21:35,280 --> 02:21:36,920
He has always been trying
 to make us miserable

1160
02:21:37,160 --> 02:21:39,600
No son! He is your father

1161
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:42,920
My father?

1162
02:21:44,040 --> 02:21:47,720
What are you saying, Ma?
 What has come over you?

1163
02:21:48,680 --> 02:21:52,040
I'm not out of my mind, son.
 What I'm saying is the truth

1164
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:54,920
I could not bring myself
 to tell you this until now

1165
02:21:56,520 --> 02:22:00,880
But if not today, once I'm gone
 who else could tell you?

1166
02:22:02,280 --> 02:22:06,160
This can't be, Ma!
 This can never be!

1167
02:22:07,040 --> 02:22:11,000
This is a long story.
 But I don't have the time

1168
02:22:12,720 --> 02:22:16,360
Keep this. I'm leaving

1169
02:22:17,640 --> 02:22:20,600
He will surely recognize you
 when you show him this

1170
02:22:22,360 --> 02:22:29,680
He has never forgiven me.
 But he will surely forgive his son

1171
02:22:32,800 --> 02:22:36,000
I won't seek mercy from the one
 who tortured my mother all her life...

1172
02:22:36,240 --> 02:22:41,360
the one who made her beg from door
 to door. Ma, I won't have his mercy!

1173
02:22:44,920 --> 02:22:52,480
If I could see him for once before
 I died... But why would he come here

1174
02:22:54,040 --> 02:22:56,280
Come
 - I'm leaving Ma

1175
02:22:58,280 --> 02:23:00,640
I'll avenge you, I will
 - No!

1176
02:23:00,840 --> 02:23:02,920
I'll surely avenge you, I will
 - No, son!

1177
02:23:11,760 --> 02:23:14,360
The Judge is here to see you

1178
02:23:15,240 --> 02:23:19,800
Which Judge?
 - The one whose car ran you over

1179
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:31,640
So he has come... before I'm dead

1180
02:23:32,520 --> 02:23:34,520
Alas, I cannot see

1181
02:23:35,800 --> 02:23:40,520
Nurse, give him my greetings

1182
02:23:43,360 --> 02:23:47,040
I am ashamed about the accident.
 Please forgive me

1183
02:23:47,880 --> 02:23:50,120
Forgive you...?

1184
02:24:40,520 --> 02:24:43,840
You didn't die! You were killed!

1185
02:24:44,760 --> 02:24:49,240
That heartless judge has killed you!
 To make sure that he isn't exposed!

1186
02:25:48,200 --> 02:25:51,840
Have you decided the verdict
 about the case?

1187
02:25:56,400 --> 02:25:57,280
Case?

1188
02:25:57,640 --> 02:26:00,080
Raj's case

1189
02:26:01,440 --> 02:26:05,480
You are going mad!
 What are you doing to yourself?

1190
02:26:06,440 --> 02:26:08,200
You are a mature, educated woman

1191
02:26:09,920 --> 02:26:11,800
In a few days, you'll start
 going to court as a lawyer

1192
02:26:12,800 --> 02:26:19,360
You might even make a judge.
 If you get emotional over every case...

1193
02:26:19,560 --> 02:26:21,600
you will never be able to
 dispense justice

1194
02:26:21,800 --> 02:26:24,480
This is not a lawsuit.
 It's my life!

1195
02:26:28,520 --> 02:26:32,320
Do you not understand as much?
 - Irrespective, it won't alter the law

1196
02:26:33,200 --> 02:26:35,080
Nor should you let your emotions
 come in the way of justice

1197
02:26:35,240 --> 02:26:38,720
Justice is all I seek.
 Raj is completely innocent

1198
02:26:38,960 --> 02:26:41,560
He killed Jagga trying to save
 his mother

1199
02:26:41,760 --> 02:26:43,880
You can read his mother's
 dying declaration

1200
02:26:45,040 --> 02:26:47,280
In this particular case,
 Raj might merit pardon

1201
02:26:48,120 --> 02:26:50,600
But his whole life is a long story
 of involvement with crime and sin

1202
02:26:51,600 --> 02:26:55,600
I cannot comprehend how you can
 sympathize with such a person

1203
02:26:57,000 --> 02:26:59,680
How can you love him?

1204
02:27:00,840 --> 02:27:02,400
You have studied the law

1205
02:27:10,280 --> 02:27:14,200
But my heart has not read the laws

1206
02:27:15,400 --> 02:27:16,320
Heart...

1207
02:27:17,280 --> 02:27:18,440
and the laws

1208
02:27:21,160 --> 02:27:22,240
The laws...

1209
02:27:23,880 --> 02:27:24,960
and the heart

1210
02:27:26,960 --> 02:27:28,640
What a strange concoction

1211
02:27:30,600 --> 02:27:32,280
But you are right

1212
02:27:34,480 --> 02:27:36,000
The heart heeds no laws

1213
02:27:38,200 --> 02:27:39,640
No laws at all

1214
02:27:41,480 --> 02:27:42,960
Not even mine

1215
02:28:01,320 --> 02:28:02,680
No!
 - Get out, Rita

1216
02:28:05,320 --> 02:28:07,760
I'm in a murderous rage!
 - Have you gone mad?

1217
02:28:08,600 --> 02:28:11,040
So you have escaped?
 - Yes

1218
02:28:12,040 --> 02:28:13,760
To settle the score with you

1219
02:28:14,520 --> 02:28:20,440
Then you will be happy to know
 that your lawyer...

1220
02:28:20,680 --> 02:28:22,840
had just convinced me
 about your innocence

1221
02:28:24,040 --> 02:28:26,400
I was inclined to let you off
 tomorrow

1222
02:28:27,400 --> 02:28:28,960
I want no mercy from you

1223
02:28:29,920 --> 02:28:32,320
I don't want your justice,
 your law, nothing!

1224
02:28:33,200 --> 02:28:34,320
All I want...

1225
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:42,560
Lost your nerve?
 You need guts to kill someone

1226
02:28:43,560 --> 02:28:47,080
You should be thanking the one
 who has just saved your life

1227
02:28:49,600 --> 02:28:51,640
What if I were to use this very knife
 to rip your heart out?

1228
02:28:52,360 --> 02:28:56,760
Judge Raghunath was compelled to kill
 a criminal to save his own life

1229
02:28:57,000 --> 02:28:59,000
What else can the verdict
 of the courts be?

1230
02:28:59,800 --> 02:29:05,760
Have you gone out of your mind too?
 - I was. For a second

1231
02:29:08,640 --> 02:29:12,280
For the scum that he is,
 the hangman's noose will be better

1232
02:29:20,280 --> 02:29:22,600
This is the story of
 Raj's life and crimes

1233
02:29:23,240 --> 02:29:27,080
Now you know why and how
 he took to crime

1234
02:29:28,400 --> 02:29:32,280
My Lord, the one who is guilty
 is his father...

1235
02:29:32,520 --> 02:29:36,160
who drove an innocent woman from
 his house, and denied his own son

1236
02:29:36,360 --> 02:29:39,720
He is the one who forced them
 to go begging from door to door

1237
02:29:39,920 --> 02:29:42,000
And in the company of criminals,
 he went astray

1238
02:29:42,760 --> 02:29:44,880
My Lord and members of the Jury...

1239
02:29:45,200 --> 02:29:49,560
if Raj is to be punished for his crime,
 then his father should be punished too

1240
02:29:52,040 --> 02:29:54,680
My Lord, I would like to say something

1241
02:29:55,920 --> 02:30:00,440
Emotion has got the better
 of the counsel for defense

1242
02:30:00,680 --> 02:30:04,040
In her anxiety to save the accused,
 the counsel has presented...

1243
02:30:04,280 --> 02:30:07,640
an interesting story,
 however incongruous it might be...

1244
02:30:09,640 --> 02:30:13,080
to try and prove that
 some criminal happens to be my son!

1245
02:30:14,560 --> 02:30:19,120
But I ask, what evidence
 does the counsel have?

1246
02:30:19,360 --> 02:30:22,160
No evidence on earth will convince you
 that Raj is your son...

1247
02:30:22,360 --> 02:30:24,480
not unless you are willing
 to accept him as your son

1248
02:30:26,320 --> 02:30:29,480
If there be proof, it lies deep
 in your heart and in Raj's eyes

1249
02:30:30,120 --> 02:30:34,160
Look at him. The same eyes,
 the same high brow

1250
02:30:34,440 --> 02:30:37,120
He even speaks like you speak.
 He's just as adamant as you are

1251
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:40,360
Are you still not willing
 to accept him as your son?

1252
02:30:40,640 --> 02:30:42,680
Ms Rita, the law heeds no emotion

1253
02:30:43,760 --> 02:30:46,600
Nor my Lord, does the heart
 heed any law

1254
02:30:48,360 --> 02:30:49,680
I have no more to say

1255
02:30:57,800 --> 02:31:01,560
If the accused has anything to say
 in his defense, he may proceed

1256
02:31:12,480 --> 02:31:18,240
Yes. At last, after being branded
 a murderer, I hold your attention

1257
02:31:23,040 --> 02:31:27,720
Had I been heard earlier, perhaps
 I would never have had to stand here

1258
02:31:30,720 --> 02:31:33,160
Ms Rita has tried her best
 to save me from being hanged

1259
02:31:33,760 --> 02:31:37,360
And not only in this particular case;
 in my personal life too

1260
02:31:40,360 --> 02:31:44,320
In my defense, I wish to say nothing.
 I am evil

1261
02:31:45,320 --> 02:31:47,000
I've been a vagabond ever since
 I was a child

1262
02:31:47,280 --> 02:31:49,280
I'm a murderer, a criminal

1263
02:31:50,640 --> 02:31:54,360
You may punish me as you please.
 But sin, crime, hatred and violence...

1264
02:31:54,560 --> 02:31:56,920
this vicious circle that holds
 your society in a vice-grip...

1265
02:31:57,160 --> 02:31:59,960
do you think it can be broken
 by hanging me?

1266
02:32:00,520 --> 02:32:02,560
I don't want to tell you
 the story of my life

1267
02:32:03,400 --> 02:32:08,760
But all I want to say is, I did not
 inherit crime from my parents

1268
02:32:10,520 --> 02:32:12,800
From that gutter full of filth
 that flows beside my shanty...

1269
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:16,960
I picked up crime. That gutter
 is still flowing over

1270
02:32:18,240 --> 02:32:20,200
And the virus still breeds

1271
02:32:22,400 --> 02:32:26,200
And countless children who live
 in those slums...

1272
02:32:26,440 --> 02:32:28,760
are falling prey to the virus
 every day

1273
02:32:29,160 --> 02:32:33,360
Do not think of me. Those children
 are the ones you must care for

1274
02:32:35,760 --> 02:32:37,160
You must care for your children

1275
02:32:38,800 --> 02:32:40,040
Lest come the day when...

1276
02:32:40,640 --> 02:32:41,680
yours...

1277
02:32:42,600 --> 02:32:43,600
and yours...

1278
02:32:44,520 --> 02:32:45,520
and yours...

1279
02:32:47,400 --> 02:32:50,040
and your son too stands
 in these docks to reiterate...

1280
02:32:50,240 --> 02:32:52,560
that it's an honest father's blood
 that flows in my veins

1281
02:32:54,120 --> 02:32:57,240
Time was when I was an innocent boy,
 just like your sons

1282
02:32:58,800 --> 02:33:01,880
Like all mothers, my mother too
 wove a golden dream for me

1283
02:33:04,040 --> 02:33:07,240
She would say, "My son will grow up
 to become a lawyer"

1284
02:33:08,520 --> 02:33:15,000
"Then he will become a magistrate.
 And then, a judge... like his father"

1285
02:33:16,240 --> 02:33:18,200
I know the verdict that this court
 is about to give

1286
02:33:19,240 --> 02:33:24,120
And I'm willing to suffer any sentence.
 For my sins, this is atonement

1287
02:33:25,880 --> 02:33:27,960
But I await the decision
 from yet another quarter

1288
02:33:29,880 --> 02:33:34,360
I want to know Judge Raghunath,
 what says your heart?

1289
02:33:36,320 --> 02:33:38,400
What says your heart?

1290
02:34:57,160 --> 02:34:59,320
Has the Judge come to see his convict?

1291
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:03,200
A father...

1292
02:35:05,520 --> 02:35:06,560
who is guilty

1293
02:35:08,360 --> 02:35:10,080
Guilty? You?

1294
02:35:11,480 --> 02:35:12,360
Yes.

1295
02:35:13,600 --> 02:35:16,080
Tomorrow, the law might
 pronounce you guilty

1296
02:35:18,320 --> 02:35:22,480
But in the eyes of God,
 I am the one who is guilty

1297
02:35:56,600 --> 02:35:58,080
Are you weeping?

1298
02:35:58,720 --> 02:36:03,040
Yes, for the father who found his son,
 and yet he has lost him

1299
02:36:04,040 --> 02:36:06,240
For the husband who forced his wife
 to become a widow

1300
02:36:07,600 --> 02:36:10,440
For society, where poverty
 breeds crime

1301
02:36:11,240 --> 02:36:13,240
For the son who is orphaned
 though his father is alive

1302
02:36:13,360 --> 02:36:15,240
For the child who goes through life
 looking for someone...

1303
02:36:15,360 --> 02:36:16,920
who will call him "Son"

1304
02:36:17,120 --> 02:36:18,000
Son

1305
02:37:00,200 --> 02:37:04,480
Raj, son of Judge Raghunath,
 you have been proved guilty...

1306
02:37:04,680 --> 02:37:07,760
of trying to assassinate
 your father, Judge Raghunath

1307
02:37:08,320 --> 02:37:12,240
But in the light of the strange and
 unfortunate circumstances your life...

1308
02:37:12,440 --> 02:37:15,240
which your counsel Ms Rita
 has presented...

1309
02:37:15,440 --> 02:37:18,440
you are sentenced to only three years
 of rigorous imprisonment

1310
02:37:53,600 --> 02:37:54,520
Crying?

1311
02:37:55,720 --> 02:37:56,840
You silly girl

1312
02:37:57,640 --> 02:37:58,840
Silly girls never cry

1313
02:37:59,720 --> 02:38:01,920
At this rate, how are you
 going to practice?

1314
02:38:02,360 --> 02:38:07,440
What use is the practice, Raj?
 I wasn't able to save you

1315
02:38:08,960 --> 02:38:12,960
No Rita, this penance
 is very important for me

1316
02:38:14,720 --> 02:38:16,560
Only after I've been through this,
 will I be worthy of you

1317
02:38:18,760 --> 02:38:20,760
With you beside me,
 I can go through anything

1318
02:38:24,320 --> 02:38:26,040
I will become an honest man

1319
02:38:27,160 --> 02:38:28,640
Everyone will say I'm a good man

1320
02:38:30,280 --> 02:38:32,320
I will read, I will write

1321
02:38:34,120 --> 02:38:37,720
And just like Ma used to say,
 first I'll become a lawyer...

1322
02:38:37,960 --> 02:38:39,560
then a magistrate

1323
02:38:42,640 --> 02:38:44,040
And then, a judge

1324
02:38:46,720 --> 02:38:51,360
Last night I saw a judge.
 I'll become a judge

1325
02:38:57,080 --> 02:38:59,040
You won't call me a savage anymore,
 will you?

1326
02:38:59,280 --> 02:39:01,640
I will. You savage!

1327
02:39:06,600 --> 02:39:07,520
Time up

1328
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:09,880
Come on

1329
02:39:23,880 --> 02:39:24,920
Keep this

1330
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:27,520
It's your gift

1331
02:39:29,640 --> 02:39:32,280
Don't worry. I didn't steal it

1332
02:39:32,840 --> 02:39:34,520
I just smuggled it in

1333
02:39:49,760 --> 02:39:53,080
Not your fault, Rita.
 It's just the way I look

1334
02:40:00,720 --> 02:40:05,400
Three years isn't too long, Raj.
 I'll wait for you

1335
02:40:07,160 --> 02:40:09,320
I'll wait for you!
 - Don't cry

1336
02:40:14,720 --> 02:40:18,800
Number 308... move it

1337
02:40:22,320 --> 02:40:23,680
I should be leaving
