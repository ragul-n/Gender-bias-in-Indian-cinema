"Hello-Hello... 1-2-3...check."

00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:58,060
"To my future husband,I share a few compliments..."

6
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:02,980
"To my future husband,I share a few compliments..."

7
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:07,650
"Your groomsmen look less appealingand more like wild animals."

8
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:11,310
"What's so amazing about you?"

9
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,770
"You talk the talk butcan you walk the walk?."

10
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:27,980
"Jugni's got an attitude..."

11
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:30,190
"...higher than Everest."

12
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,600
"Jugni is a fashionita..."

13
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:35,020
"...and talks only in English."

14
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:39,310
"The boy's such a simpleton...like Bholenath."

15
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,900
"I wonder how did hedare to ask for her hand."

16
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:48,770
"I am the bee...and you're the bud...flying here and there..."

17
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:57,400
"I am the bee...and you're the bud...flying here and there..."

18
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:01,650
"I slapped him andhe scattered like cards."

19
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:06,690
"Here I am at your doorstep...this time there's no escape."

20
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:10,560
"With all my confidence I proposedto you on Valentines Day and said..."

21
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,810
"Jugni... Jugni..."

22
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,190
"Jugni... Jugni... Jugni..."

23
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:17,310
"Jugni, will you marry me?"

24
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,600
"Jugni, will you marry me?"

25
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:21,730
"Jugni, will you marry me?"

26
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,980
"Jugni, will you marry me?"

27
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,230
"Jugni, will you marry me?"

28
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:28,730
"Jugni, will you marry me?"

29
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:33,230
"Let me tell you a secret,baby, even you said to me."

30
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,350
"Beloved, will you marry me."

31
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,650
"Beloved, will you marry me."

32
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:39,770
"Jugni, will you marry me?"

33
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:42,310
"Jugni, will you marry me?"

34
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:21,310
"If you want to stay alive..."

35
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,900
"...don't lock horns with me."

36
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:30,350
"I am warning you..."

37
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,600
"...there will be a riot."

38
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:39,350
"If you want to stay alive..."

39
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,600
"...don't lock horns with me."

40
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,940
"I am warning you..."

41
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,150
"...there will be a riot."

42
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:50,600
"Here I am at your doorstep...this time there's no escape."

43
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:54,440
"With all my confidence I Proposedto you on Valentines Day and said..."

44
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,730
"Jugni... Jugni..."

45
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:58,940
"Jugni... Jugni... Jugni..."

46
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:01,230
"Jugni, will you marry me?"

47
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:03,480
"Jugni, will you marry me?"

48
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,650
"Jugni, will you marry me?"

49
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:07,900
"Jugni, will you marry me?"

50
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,190
"Jugni, will you marry me?"

51
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,730
"Jugni, will you marry me?"

52
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:17,060
"Let me tell you a secret,baby, even I proposed..."

53
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:19,270
"Beloved, will you marry me."

54
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,560
"Beloved, will you marry me."

55
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:23,810
"Jugni, will you marry me?"

56
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,100
"Beloved, will you marry me."

57
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:28,310
"Jugni, will you marry me?"

58
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,560
"Beloved, will you marry me."

59
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:31,850
"Jugni..."

60
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:36,770
"Jugni..."

61
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:40,690
"Jugni..."

62
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:52,000
Bro...it's 11 pm,and Bhoomi hasn't returned yet.

63
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:58,090
Look bro,...the bride's makeup, henna...

64
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:01,090
...plus, it's her friend's wedding.

65
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,420
All this takes time.

66
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,750
This isn't right.- What?

67
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:07,500
You made a large peg for yourself...

68
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:10,670
...and a really small one for me.

69
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,460
This isn't right.

70
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:15,170
This isn't...- Right.

71
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:17,000
Should I fix it?- Please do.

72
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:18,380
Come on.

73
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,380
Exchanging glasses...

74
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:28,210
Is this right?- Right? It's absolutely right!

75
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:30,000
In fact, it's so right...

76
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:31,630
...that, nothing couldbe more right than this.

77
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:33,920
Nothing can be more right than this.

78
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,590
Come on, Bhoomi, get down.Give me your hand.

79
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,670
Bhoomi...

80
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,210
I always wanted to ride a horse.

81
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,630
Only grooms ride a horse,not the bride.

82
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:45,380
Hmm... start dancing then.

83
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,090
Why?

84
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:49,420
It's a wedding horse... we won'tmove ahead until you don't dance.

85
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:51,210
Bhoomi, please.It's getting late, for the horse too.

86
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,420
Even I am saying please...

87
00:06:53,500 --> 00:07:00,840
You know... Neeraj is exactlythe guy I wanted for my daughter.

88
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,170
It's fantastic, and so, you must takeadvantage of this opportunity...

89
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:05,170
...and get married as well.

90
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:12,670
You see... I've seen this really beautiful40-45-year-old young woman for you.

91
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:15,090
She's so gorgeous.

92
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:18,250
Beauty spot on her forehead.Another on her cheeks.

93
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:21,250
And one on her lips...Even on her neck.

94
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,000
Stop it, man...

95
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:25,130
What am I going todo with all those beauty spots?

96
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:27,090
Here...there...

97
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:30,000
I know you'rereally happy on the inside.

98
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,090
Stop here, mister.

99
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,920
Listen, where are youtaking me for our honeymoon?

100
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,500
Bangladesh.

101
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:40,420
Just joking... I haven'tthought about it.

102
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:43,130
But mom's suggested that wemust visit Vaishnodevi (Pilgrimage)!

103
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:44,800
Wow!

104
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:46,840
Glory to Goddess!- Glory to Goddess!

105
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,840
Shall we...

106
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:52,340
Good... Thank you, brother.

107
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,500
Look...

108
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:56,920
Al-Kaida....

109
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,460
Your sister-in-law Alka...

110
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:01,300
She's more like Al-Qaidathan she's my wife.

111
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:04,420
She's the reasonI became an Al-coholic.

112
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:07,550
Hello...Bless you...

113
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,550
No-no...I am not drunk at all.

114
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,750
In fact, I'm showing twoJapanese's around Taj Mahal.

115
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,130
At night? Is it night already?

116
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:24,090
You see, the touristsenjoy better at night...

117
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,800
I'll be right there.

118
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,090
Come on, man...cheers.

119
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,750
Yeah...

120
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:40,380
She saw us drinking alcohol.

121
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:44,670
Mister, she saw you,my back was turned towards her.

122
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,960
I am leaving.

123
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:47,800
Cheers.

124
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:55,250
Speed breaker inside the house!

125
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:58,000
Where are you going?

126
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,460
I came from there....

127
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,050
Then how am I going this way?

128
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,130
It's a mirror.- Mirror?

129
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:12,380
But, when I came insidethere was a door here.

130
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:13,670
The door's that way.

131
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,050
The wind must have pushed it there.

132
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:18,050
What's going to happento this country?

133
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:20,130
People are alwaysmaking such a difference.

134
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:24,130
But, I am the only guywho has made no difference...

135
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:25,050
Bravo...

136
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:26,420
Jai Hind!- Jai Hind!

137
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:36,420
Sweetu...

138
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,000
You exercise in themorning...and drink at night.

139
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:40,630
Very good

140
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:47,300
Look...

141
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:51,750
If I drink in the morning...and exercise at night...

142
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:54,380
...then,that wouldn't be right either.

143
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:59,000
Look...I cooked food for you.

144
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,000
With my own hands.

145
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:03,750
Why did you? I am not hungry anyway.

146
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:06,500
But I am hungry.- Then eat it.

147
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:12,460
Have I ever eaten withoutfeeding you first?

148
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,960
You should now.

149
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,590
I'll be leaving anyway...

150
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,800
You should get used to eating alone.

151
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,590
Yeah... you're leaving, Sweetu...

152
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:34,750
But, Sweetu...I madethis with my own hands.

153
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:37,590
How else does anyone cook food?

154
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,550
Sweetu...

155
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,960
Look.

156
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,710
Your father made these...

157
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,750
...with his own hands,for your wedding.

158
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,130
Studded with pearls here.

159
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,630
And I stitched themwith silver threads...

160
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:15,880
Anyone will do like this.

161
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,750
For my daughter.

162
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,250
Father, did you make okra?

163
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:31,500
I am hungry.

164
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:34,750
My daughter's hungry.

165
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,130
It's still hot.

166
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:51,380
Why are you crying?

167
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,500
It's very spicy.

168
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,210
I am not crying.

169
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:01,550
I put too much spice in your food.

170
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:05,300
Forgive me, dear.

171
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,130
I wish...it was spicy, papa.

172
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:35,840
Sweetu...

173
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:40,210
It didn't even take thislong to grow the grey hairs.

174
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:43,880
Takes time to coloreach grey hair, papa.

175
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,090
By the way...people say that...

176
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:48,460
...if you pluck grey hair,more grows in its place.

177
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,000
Hmm...

178
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:52,460
Then why don't peoplepluck black hair?

179
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:55,840
I did ask one of my friendsto pluck his black hair.

180
00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:00,840
Unfortunately,his hair never grew back.

181
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:05,170
Now for a shave.

182
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:07,130
Shave?- Yes...

183
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:11,500
Sweetu... I'll pay you if you like.

184
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:15,090
You don't need to be mypersonal barber every morning.

185
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:18,000
You'll look absolutely dashing.

186
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,840
Dyed hair...clean shave...

187
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,630
Every 'Mumtaz' in Agra...

188
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:25,590
...won't be able to taketheir eyes off this 'Shahjahan'!

189
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:27,050
And then?

190
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:30,130
Then, you can take your pick...

191
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:31,840
...and marry one of them, what else?

192
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:33,880
Did you hear that Sudha?

193
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:37,880
She's planning tobring home a mistress.

194
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:44,090
Sorry, mom!Once I am gone...

195
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:46,840
...there must be someoneto look after you.

196
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,500
You're getting married next month.

197
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:51,380
And you're suggestingthat I should get married too.

198
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,920
I don't want to leave you, papa.

199
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:58,050
What did you say?You don't want to leave me.

200
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,710
Sweetu... I wish youhad said this before.

201
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,340
I've already spent all this money...

202
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:04,710
It's pointless to talk to you.

203
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,590
"Bless the blind with eyes...And the sick, with good health."

204
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:16,500
"Bless the barren-women, with a son...And grace to those who are poor."

205
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:20,500
"You're revered with betel-leaf,flowers and dry fruits."

206
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:25,380
"Glory to you, O Lord Ganesha."

207
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:27,090
At least tell me...

208
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:28,920
...why should the barren-womenbe blessed with a son...

209
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:29,960
...and not daughter?

210
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:34,000
Sweetu... no one's evergiven it a serious thought.

211
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:35,800
That's the problem...

212
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,210
People only take interestin what benefits them...

213
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,710
...but, not in what it actually means.

214
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:39,880
You get it, don't you?

215
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:42,920
Why don't you explainit to me when you get the time?

216
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,590
Thank you.

217
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,050
I've made some reallyscrumptious stuffed pancakes.

218
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:53,050
Yeah...which I taught you to make.

219
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:56,420
Otherwise, you could only make faces.

220
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:57,960
And, those weren't pleasant either.

221
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:02,090
Serve breakfast, will you.- I am.

222
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:13,440
Hello.- Hello uncle.

223
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:17,020
"Be careful not to cut his ears off.."

224
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,480
Son, give them any shoe they like...

232
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:47,600

246
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,230

247
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,230
Sorry-Sorry.

248
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:24,980
You see...in all this excitement...

249
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:29,020
...this Indian didn't realize thathe has strayed into Chinese borders.

250
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:39,770
Sweetu... you've such thick,black, hair.

251
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:43,270
All thanks to your massages.

252
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:45,690
Your massages are just wonderful.

253
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:50,190
Sweetu... I was thinking aboutopening up a massage parlor.

254
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:53,520
You see, then we'llown every type business...

255
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,100
...from head to toe.

256
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,810
Sweetu... you let such disgustingthings creep up your head.

257
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:04,190
Yuck... Papa!

258
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,310
At least you shouldstart charging them rent.

259
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:14,850
I've told you a thousandtimes to drive slow.

260
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,770
It's a scooter, not an airplane.Understand?

261
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:19,650
You would even makeairplanes fly slow. Isn't it?

262
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,060
Stop talking nonsense.

263
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:23,440
Papa, please tell him topick me up from college on time.

264
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,600
He was 20 minutes late even today.

265
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:28,480
And you know what kindof boys stand out there.

266
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,730
They whistle and tease...

267
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:32,060
Come on... stop blamingthe boys for everything.

268
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:35,230
Why can't you cover your head?

269
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,400
See how he's talking to me, papa.

270
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:39,020
I'm older to him,but he has no manners.

271
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,020
Let it be...you're justone year older to me.

272
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,770
And where's my mobile?Give me my mobile.

273
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:47,190
If you're such a grown-up,buy your own mobile.

274
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,150
Where are you going now?

275
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:50,730
Who's going to sit in the shop?- I didn't come here to sit.

276
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:51,770
I've got things to do...

277
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:53,850
Like taking sister Bhoomito the market, and I'll be late.

278
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,900
Miss me...if you can.

279
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:02,980
Sorry, sister...I am late.- So what's new.

280
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,350
You're always late.- Sit.

281
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,150
Let's go.- Come on.

282
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,400
Drive properly.- I am...

283
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,900
You fixed Bhoomi's wedding so soon.

284
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,940
It was the only auspiciousday I could find.

285
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:23,060
Don't hesitate if you need anything.

286
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,270
We're like family.

287
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,400
We'll be buying all thewedding sweets from your shop.

288
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,440
Vishal already knows everything.

289
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,190
Isn't that right, Vishal?

290
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:29,810
Hello, aunty.- Yes - Hello.

291
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:30,900
Bhoomi, you?

292
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,600
I went over to the shop.You left the guest-list at home.

293
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:36,060
Everything else comes later...

294
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,810
First, have a sweet.- Thank you.

295
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,980
Congratulations on your wedding.

296
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,350
How about some for me...I don't have diabetes.

297
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:44,060
Here... have one.

298
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,060
Bhoomi dear.- Yes, aunty.

299
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:47,810
If you have someoneon mind for Vishal...

300
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,520
...maybe a friend,then do let me know.

301
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:50,480
Yes...

302
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:53,100
Yes, aunty.

303
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:56,150
Well, Papa, shall we go?- Okay.

304
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:57,900
Goodbye.- Goodbye.

305
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:08,480
Did you practice crying?

306
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:10,400
Practice crying?- Yeah...

307
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:15,520
Those with unrequited loveare only destined to shed tears.

308
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:18,100
Show me your purse.- Why.

309
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,350
Show me your purse.

310
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:21,690
Allow me.- What are you doing?

311
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,020
Oh, my...- Photo...

312
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,400
My advice is that you shouldget this picture out of here too.

313
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:31,730
Or replace it with a photo of LordShiv-Parvati, or Lord Shani (Saturn)!

314
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:33,600
Put that up.

315
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,520
Only They can solve your problem now.

316
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,020
Jeetu.- Coming, sister.

317
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:45,230
Listen... even you shouldstart calling her sister now.

318
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,020
And you must attendyour sister's wedding.

319
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,440
Jeetu.- Coming, sister.

320
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:08,020
"Divine..."

321
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,650
"Divine..."

322
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:17,190
"My beloved's divine."

323
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:45,020
"My heart beats...because of you."

324
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:50,730
"My world resides in your heart."

325
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:56,230
"You're my first love, and my last."

326
00:20:56,310 --> 00:21:02,730
"I believe your love's divine."

327
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:07,940
"May no one jinx our love."

328
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:12,900
"Come here, dear, give me a hug."

329
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:18,150
"Beloved... come in my arms.."

330
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:23,770
"Beloved... come in my arms.."

331
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:30,350
"May no one jinx our love."

332
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:35,270
"Come here, dear, give me a hug."

333
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:40,900
"Beloved... come in my arms.."

334
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:46,310
"Beloved... come in my arms.."

335
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:49,480
"Divine..."

336
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:52,400
"Divine..."

337
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:57,980
"My beloved's divine."

338
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:00,730
"Divine..."

339
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:03,520
"Divine..."

340
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:09,560
"My beloved's divine."

341
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,850
What's going on, brother Dhauli?

342
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:32,770
Hide and Seek.

343
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:38,810
Hide and Seek?

344
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:41,650
Children play Hide and Seek.

345
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:51,850
This is Hide and Shriek.

346
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,980
This is a very dangerous game.

347
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:16,310
Did you expect one ofthose boring board games?

348
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:22,400
Hey come on.

349
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:26,480
Why are you fuming?

350
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:28,560
Come.. come.

351
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:33,150
Why hasn't anyone returned yet?

352
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:37,520
In this country,finding a girl and a job take time.

353
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:41,480
And what if they find the girl?

354
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,520
Whoever finds the girl...

355
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,060
...can have her for the entire night.

356
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:48,440
Would you like to play?- No! Not me.

357
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,060
Hey wait.

358
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,900
Dhauli bhai...

359
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:12,980
I knew it... Like always,the 'Ghulam' will get the Queen.

360
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:14,940
You know Dhauli bhai...

361
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:18,060
...I can sniff out thebody from its fragrance.

362
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:21,730
Bravo!

363
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:24,940
I wish you had played too...

364
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,100
...it would've been much more fun.

365
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:30,310
Dhauli never plays anygame where he's bound to win.

366
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:32,100
Until you don't experiencethe fear of losing...

367
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:34,480
...there's no fun in winning.

368
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:36,940
You're a man of principles.

369
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:39,060
I may not be Salman Khan...

370
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:41,600
...but, even I can make few commitments.

371
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,810
Drink... you only had two.

372
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:46,690
Drink...

373
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:47,600
Take it.

374
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:57,980
Dhauli... Bhoomi's getting married.

375
00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:59,560
Wow... good news.

376
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:00,810
Where are the sweets?

377
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,690
We could've had some sweets.

378
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:08,440
All that time in the shopmaking sweets has made you wuss.

379
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:11,060
I am not a wuss...

380
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:13,100
I did tell her that I loved her.

381
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:16,850
But she didn't believe me.And said no.

382
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:20,810
Dhauli, if he hadn'tbeen your aunt's son...

383
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:24,940
...then, I swear I would'vebanned him from entering Dholpur.

384
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:32,480
Go tell her...you're Dhauli's brother.- Doesn't matter.

385
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:34,900
She is already engaged.- But she isn't married yet.

386
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:37,810
Look...

387
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:44,190
...I've grabbed lands thatwere registered to someone else.

388
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:45,940
Tell her politely.

389
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:49,100
If she still doesn't agree,then we're here.

390
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:53,810
Your name's 'Vishal' (Big),so grow up.

391
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:54,650
Drink up...

392
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:56,520
Come on... drink.

393
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:09,600
"O beautiful bride."

394
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:14,560
"You were destined togrow young some day" - Turn.

395
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:16,730
"Become the queen..."- Dip-dip-dip.

396
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:18,900
"...of some king one day."- 1-2-3-4...

397
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:22,650
"You were destined to growyoung some day" - 1-2-3-4... Turn.

398
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:26,400
"O beautiful bride."- 1-2-3...

399
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:29,440
Arun...if you keep dancing like this.

400
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,980
Then, I swear,I'll sell my plot in Mathura...

401
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,310
...and squander all that money on you.

402
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,020
Get lost...

403
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:38,190
Music off...- Sell your plot...

404
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:40,150
What is it?- Sweetu...

405
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,190
why are you forcing me to dance?

406
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:43,730
All the guests will be dancing...

407
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,310
...aren't we going to dance too.We'll be humiliated.

408
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,810
No way we'll gethumiliated when I'm there.

409
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,270
What do you think I am here for?

410
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:53,940
I can do snakes,serpents, pythons, cobra, bats, rats...

411
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:55,440
...and, every other vermin dance.

412
00:26:55,520 --> 00:27:00,100
Buddy...I can even danceon the sound of firecrackers.

413
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,310
Isn't that right, Al-Kaida?

414
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:06,560
The day this crackerexplodes...I'll blow up with her.

415
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:09,520
Let's see you dance.- First, make sounds like a firecracker.

416
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,600
From where?- From your mouth.

417
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:13,900
Come on!

418
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:23,690
"You were destined to growyoung some day"

419
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:28,020
"O beautiful bride."

420
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:32,600
"You were destined to growyoung some day"

421
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:33,770
Bhoomi.

422
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:35,940
Wait... I'm coming.

423
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:38,310
Did you bring everything?- Yes.

424
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:40,650
Thank you.

425
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:42,060
Bhoomi.- Yeah....

426
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,020
Listen...- Yeah.

427
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:45,810
I love you.

428
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:50,100
Have you lost your mind?

429
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,600
Bhoomi...

430
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:58,480
I already told youonce...don't you get it?

431
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:02,060
What do you want?- You.

432
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:04,690
Stop drivelling,I'm getting married in two days.

433
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:06,020
That's why I came today...

434
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,810
Bhoomi, I really love you a lot.

435
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:09,980
I love you.

436
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:13,190
I've already toldyou a thousand times...

437
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:15,150
...that I don't love you.

438
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:16,100
I know.

439
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:19,060
But, please try to understand.

440
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:23,810
Please, cancel this wedding.- I would rather break your face.

441
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:27,980
It's my fault thatI still consider you a friend.

442
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,770
Come on... Get lost.

443
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:31,400
Get out... Now!

444
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,400
Bhoomi!

445
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:48,600
Wah Taj...

446
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:52,310
I was wondering, Arun buddy...

447
00:28:56,770 --> 00:29:01,520
After the wedding,when Bhoomi has children...

448
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:05,310
...do you know what she will become?

449
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,980
What?- 'Matra Bhoomi' (Mother Land)!

450
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:09,480
How was it?

451
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,810
Bad, wasn't it?

452
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:13,770
Hang it little higher,or it will fall on someone's head.

453
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:15,940
Okay sister- Bhoomi... Bhoomi...

454
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:24,100
So scared...

455
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:28,100
Is she your daughter or the DIG?

456
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:31,100
I am tired of working all day,and you guys are taking a break.

457
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:32,980
No-no...we're tired too.

458
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:35,650
See...we're tired...very tired.

459
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,850
Bhoomi... hey, Bhoomi.

460
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,940
What kind of juice was that?

461
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:55,020
You tell her... I'm suddenlyfeeling very sleepy.

462
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,440
You will definitely get high.

463
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,900
Dear...

464
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:04,100
Hey, dear...

465
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,270
Why are you shaking like this?

466
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,270
I don't know.

467
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:13,850
I got it, Papa.

468
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:19,060
Bless the barren-women,with a son...

469
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:21,730
And why not a daughter...

470
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:30,600
A daughter always leaves her father.

471
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:34,980
Correct?

472
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:40,100
Okay, one question.

473
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:46,810
A girl has a in-law's home...

474
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:51,980
...parent's home.

475
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:59,690
But why doesn't she have a home?

476
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:06,270
I won't go. I won't go.

477
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:09,230
I won't go.

478
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,520
I won't go, papa.

479
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:18,400
I won't go, papa.

480
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,900
Thank you so much, Bhoomi.

481
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:23,940
Your wedding is tomorrow...

482
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:26,150
...and yet you showed up to help me out.

483
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:28,400
The chief guest willarrive in half an hour.

484
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:30,230
The arrangements are proper.- Okay.

485
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,690
Jeetu.- Coming, sister.

486
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:35,600
Come quickly.

487
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:43,190
You're still not here.- Look, don't get angry.

488
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:45,020
I'm very busy...our wedding is tomorrow.

489
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:47,150
Yes, but...that's why I wanted to meet.

490
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,730
Look...from tomorrow,we'll be husband and wife.

491
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,810
A big zero in romance.

492
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:54,900
Let's get married first...

493
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,350
...and then you'llsee how romantic I am.

494
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,520
I don't want to talk to you.

495
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,900
Hang up.

496
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:03,770
What happened, sister? All okay?

497
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,650
I see...

498
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:07,730
You're worried becausebrother-in-law didn't show up.

499
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:11,350
Listen, we'll leave in a bit. Okay.

500
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:12,560
Okay sister.

501
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:19,900
Drive faster. I am really sleepy.

502
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:23,520
My family keeps telling me,"Jeetu, drive slowly".

503
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,190
And you say... "Drive faster".

504
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:30,900
You guys have ruined thebalance in my life, sister.

505
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:34,480
Stop blabbering and drive.- Just a minute.

506
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:35,600
What?

507
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,810
Just get down for a second, sister.- What?

508
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:39,980
Please get down.

509
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:44,850
I had a couple of soft drinks.

510
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:47,310
The dam can break any moment.- You're just too much.

511
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,310
Two minutes sister.

512
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:53,770
Head is paining.Feeling sleepy.

513
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:56,060
Yes coming.

514
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,150
Sister Bhoomi.

515
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:36,690
Sister Bhoomi!

516
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,690
Where did she go?

517
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:42,940
Sister Bhoomi!

518
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,060
You said no to me.

519
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:48,770
Me?

520
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,060
I told you so many times...

521
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:54,850
"I love you! I love you!"

522
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,770
But no...

523
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:02,440
I pampered a shoe-seller's daughter.

524
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:03,900
Just Once...

525
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:08,270
If only you had said yes,I would've done anything you said.

526
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:09,560
Anything...

527
00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:13,400
We're better off as friends.

528
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:15,150
But what good is your friendship?

529
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:17,520
What good is your friendship?

530
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:19,770
To help you with your wedding?

531
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,270
Welcome the guests? What?

532
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:26,520
You want to marry that doctor.

533
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:30,190
You want to marry that doctor.

534
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,270
I'll teach you a lesson...

535
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:36,690
...you'll never forget all your life.

536
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:40,270
Enough with the small talks.Start the show.

537
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,440
Grow up.

538
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:24,100
Dhauli bhai, you too?

539
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,230
...but, it can definitelydouse the fire.

540
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:29,230
Bravo.

541
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:03,730
I'll kill her, Dhauli bhai.

542
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:05,150
What if she opens her mouth?

543
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:07,650
What will she tell anyone?

544
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:12,440
Tomorrow is her wedding.

545
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:14,100
She's an Indian woman.

546
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,100
They care more about theirfather's honour and pride.

547
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:20,480
Congratulations for your wedding.

548
00:39:48,770 --> 00:39:51,980
Your father will never tolerate this.

549
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:54,980
Look...

550
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:57,350
Your wedding is tomorrow.

551
00:39:58,350 --> 00:40:00,600
Everything will be fine.

552
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:03,100
Look...

553
00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:06,310
...Don't tell anyone.

554
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,310
No one should know.

555
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:49,310
Sister, where were you yesterday?

556
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:53,480
Anyway... let's take a selfie...

557
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:56,400
Smile. Look here.

558
00:40:58,270 --> 00:40:59,600
One more...

559
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:01,190
Stop bothering her.

560
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:03,270
Leave, and let her get ready.

561
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:28,100
Arun, why did you put up thissale at your daughter's wedding?

562
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:29,900
why bring all theseshoes to the wedding?

563
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:31,230
Come here.

564
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:33,770
It's my daughter's wedding.

565
00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:36,230
I will gift everyguest his favorite shoe.

566
00:41:36,810 --> 00:41:38,650
Then, we'll steal every guest's shoes.

567
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:41,730
And demand money for every shoe...

568
00:41:41,810 --> 00:41:44,020
...and pay for the wedding expenses.

569
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,310
How's my idea?

570
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,020
Rubbish, isn't it? Let's go.

571
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:33,770
You're looking really beautiful.

572
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:42,770
I was really busyand couldn't show up.

573
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,400
I swear I was busy.

574
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:46,520
Your condition was...

575
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,190

576
00:42:48,310 --> 00:42:49,400
So, here I am.

577
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:52,770
This is your last chance.

578
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:55,150
Take one good look at your boyfriend.

579
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:58,770
Tomorrow I'll be your husband.

580
00:44:58,190 --> 00:45:01,020
Wow...fantastic.

581
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:05,440
Sir, our daughter...- Wait a minute.

582
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:06,980
Only five more balls to go.

583
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:14,900

584
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:16,900

Only four balls to go.

586
00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:20,400
So...who's going to win?

587
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:21,350
Sir, you can watch the match later...

588
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:25,190
Sir...you know those girlswho dance at the match.

589
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:28,400
They should sell ticketsto see those girls too.

590
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:29,100
Sir, I...

591
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:31,440

Arun! Arun!

594
00:45:44,350 --> 00:45:45,810

00:45:46,230 --> 00:45:47,190

596
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,020
Let go...

597
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,900
There's been a rape, sir... rape...

598
00:45:54,190 --> 00:45:58,270
There's more rape in thiscountry than cricket matches.

599
00:45:58,350 --> 00:45:59,520
He broke our TV.

600
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:00,900
You just sc**** the match.

601
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:04,940
Government propertiesdon't last too long anyway.

602
00:46:05,310 --> 00:46:07,150
And you just broke theonly thing that was working.

603
00:46:10,850 --> 00:46:11,850
Anyway...

604
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:14,940
It's a rape case,this is more important.

605
00:46:17,310 --> 00:46:18,810
So tell me...when was she raped?

606
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:21,850
Sir, she...- Was your daughter raped?

607
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:24,810
No. It was his daughter.

608
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:28,100
He's my friend, I...am her uncle.

609
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:30,770
Uncle's bickering...is the father dumb?

610
00:46:30,850 --> 00:46:32,440
Every daughter's father is dumb, sir.

611
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:36,060
When was she raped?- Yesterday.

612
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:38,310
Great...

613
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:42,100
She was raped yesterday,and you're reporting it today.

614
00:46:42,850 --> 00:46:43,440
Huh!

615
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:44,560
What is this?

616
00:46:45,650 --> 00:46:48,150
Who did it?- Don't know.

617
00:46:48,230 --> 00:46:49,020
Don't know?

618
00:46:49,810 --> 00:46:52,600
She was unconscious.- Ohh...

619
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:54,690
Tell me something...

620
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:55,900
Your daughter was raped...

621
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:59,270
...and you two bothered todress up before filing a report?

622
00:46:59,350 --> 00:47:02,100
Sir, it was her wedding.

623
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:05,100
What is this? Huh?

624
00:47:05,850 --> 00:47:08,480
You mean...your daughter was raped.

625
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:09,650
And she got married too.

626
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:11,850

627
00:47:14,230 --> 00:47:14,940
Arun... Arun...

628
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:16,310
Just a second...

629
00:47:17,230 --> 00:47:18,100
Better control him.

630
00:47:18,190 --> 00:47:19,520
Or else I'll lock him up.

631
00:47:20,190 --> 00:47:21,100
It will calm down your anger.

632
00:47:21,190 --> 00:47:22,060
And calm him down.

633
00:47:22,150 --> 00:47:23,350
Please, sir, sit down.

634
00:47:23,850 --> 00:47:24,850
Sir that...

635
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:29,600
Sir, it was her wedding today...

636
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:32,520
...and, that's whenwe found out that...

637
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:35,310
So, during the toss, you foundout that the match was cancelled.

638
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:37,650
What?

639
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:38,810
Where was the match?

00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:44,310
Note it down, Bhagwan Talkies.

643
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:47,650
And where's the victim?- Her wedding was cancelled...

644
00:47:47,730 --> 00:47:50,600
...so, she's not in a condition...- I get it.

645
00:47:51,310 --> 00:47:54,150
Come on...let's go take her statement.- Come.

646
00:48:00,270 --> 00:48:01,310

Bhoomi isn't here?

651
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:19,350
She isn't.

She isn't here either.

658
00:48:54,850 --> 00:48:56,230
Look there.

659
00:48:57,350 --> 00:48:58,520
I'll look that side.- Yes.

660
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:00,310
Did she commit suicide?

She isn't here.

662
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:13,850

00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:21,440
Have you seen Bhoomi?- No, I haven't seen her.

666

Have you seen the girl?- No.

681
00:50:08,270 --> 00:50:09,690

Hey come on.

686
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:22,310
Quiet!

687
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,150
Hey... let her go.

688
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:26,150
Now go.

689
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:29,810
I know who raped you.

690
00:50:31,350 --> 00:50:32,270
Honestly.

691
00:50:32,350 --> 00:50:35,150
The night you were raped,there were three guys.

692
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:38,480
I...was the third guy.

693
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:42,060
Listen...

694
00:50:42,150 --> 00:50:44,940
Listen to me...

695
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:51,100
And I was first.

696
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:54,230
But we didn't havemuch fun that night.

697
00:50:54,770 --> 00:50:56,020
You were unconscious.

698
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:05,650
Oh, wow! Hide and Shriek!

699
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:07,100
This is going to be fun.

700
00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:10,060
Wait...

701
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,270
Where you are running silly girl?

702
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:32,600
Please... Please, save me.

703
00:51:32,690 --> 00:51:33,350
What happened?

704
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:35,480
Please... Please, save me.

705
00:51:36,810 --> 00:51:40,520
Hey... no one will touch her!

706
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:48,350
You look familiar.

707
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:51,020
Where have I seen you?

708
00:51:52,270 --> 00:51:53,600
Where have I seen you?

709
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:58,020
Oh yes, Bhagwaan Talkies.

710
00:51:59,690 --> 00:52:03,770
Leave... leave me.

711
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:05,520
Where are you going?

712
00:53:01,350 --> 00:53:03,520
Catch her.

713
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:04,440
Quiet, you b****

714
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:06,900
I said shut up. Shut up!

715
00:53:09,190 --> 00:53:10,480
I said shut up.

716
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:13,560
Why did you go to the Police?

717
00:53:13,730 --> 00:53:15,730
You were on the vergeof getting married.

718
00:53:17,310 --> 00:53:18,810
Unfortunately,it'll be your funeral now.

719
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:44,730
Bhoomi!

720
00:54:48,020 --> 00:54:49,230
Bhoomi!

721
00:54:51,810 --> 00:54:52,650
Dear.

722
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:33,230
I couldn't save Bhoomi.

723
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:41,350
I couldn't save Bhoomi.

724
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:49,980
Dear.

725
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:54,440
My child.

726
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:58,650
I couldn't save Bhoomi.

727
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:03,440

"Hickey- Hickey- Hickey."

733
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:24,520
"Beloved...twisted my arm so hard..."

734
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:26,350
"...the pain was unbearable."

735
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:27,690
"He gave me a..."

00:57:27,770 --> 00:57:29,310
"Hickey- Hickey- Hickey-"

737
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:31,810
"Beloved...twisted my arm so hard..."

738
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:33,730
"...the pain was unbearable."

739
00:57:33,810 --> 00:57:34,900
"He gave me a..."

740
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:36,600
"Hickey- Hickey- Hickey-"

741
00:57:36,690 --> 00:57:37,310
"He's crazy..."

742
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:39,190
"...my beloved's psychedelic..."

743
00:57:39,270 --> 00:57:44,310
"...sways to the beat like...a hippie-hippie-hippie.""

744
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:47,900
"When you sing andsway to the music, dear..."

745
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:51,810
"...I can't stop whistling-whistling."

746
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:55,230
"Your beloved's trippy-trippy."

747
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:02,770
"Your beloved's trippy-trippy."

748
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:06,850
"Hickey- Hickey- Hickey."

"Hickey- Hickey- Hickey."

750

"I put on makeup for my beloved."

751
00:58:20,850 --> 00:58:24,350
"I put on makeup for my beloved."

752
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:28,100
"And breakup with my ex."

753
00:58:28,190 --> 00:58:30,560
"But my psychedelic beloved..."

754
00:58:30,650 --> 00:58:32,440
"...holds my arms..."

755
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:35,400
"And let's no one inside the house."

756
00:58:35,650 --> 00:58:39,350
"When you sing andsway to the music, dear..."

757
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:43,350
"...I can't stop whistling-whistling."

758
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:46,650
"Your beloved's trippy-trippy."

00:58:59,020 --> 00:59:01,480
"Your beloved's trippy-trippy."

763
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:05,900
Bhoomi is alive.

764
01:00:44,730 --> 01:00:47,350
'I will defeat you today.'

765
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:49,310
'You always say that,and end up losing yourself.'

766
01:00:52,060 --> 01:00:53,730
'Look there...- Don't cheat.'

767
01:00:53,810 --> 01:00:54,650
'Look here...- No!

768
01:00:54,730 --> 01:00:55,690
'Look there...- No!

769
01:00:55,770 --> 01:00:57,100
Papa.

770
01:01:20,150 --> 01:01:22,520
Dear...

771
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:26,850
Dear...

772
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:08,940
Dear.

773
01:02:10,020 --> 01:02:11,150
Dear.

774
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:17,690
Everything will be fine.

775
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:20,190
Everything will be fine.

776
01:02:22,060 --> 01:02:23,270
Calm down, dear.

777
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:25,480
Calm down!

778
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:27,650
Dear.

779
01:02:29,020 --> 01:02:30,940
I am here with you.

780
01:02:41,150 --> 01:02:42,980
Where were you, dear?

781
01:02:46,060 --> 01:02:48,650
That... that...

782
01:02:50,770 --> 01:02:56,230
That... night...

783
01:03:13,060 --> 01:03:16,600
Your honor, I would liketo call Mr. Arun Sachdeva...

784
01:03:16,690 --> 01:03:19,560
...to the witness box,with your permission.

785
01:03:19,650 --> 01:03:22,520
Proceed.- Mr. Arun Sachdeva.

786
01:03:22,850 --> 01:03:26,020
Is it true that your daughter...

787
01:03:26,230 --> 01:03:30,100
...often comes home late at nights?- Yes, but...

788
01:03:30,190 --> 01:03:34,400
Yes, or no?- Yes!

789
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:37,440
Do you love your daughter?

790
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:40,770
Every father in theworld loves his daughter.

791
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:42,940
Then what was thehurry to get her married...

792
01:03:43,020 --> 01:03:47,480
...that you fixed her weddingon the 16th of this month?

793
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:50,600
I couldn't find another auspiciousdate before seven months.

794
01:03:50,690 --> 01:03:51,190
That's why?

795
01:03:51,270 --> 01:03:52,850
You could've waited for seven months.

796
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:57,770
There's only one reason for making allthe wedding arrangements in 21 days...

797
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:01,520
...and sending your daughter away...

798
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:07,190
That his daughter lovesVishal and wants to marry him!

799
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:12,230
And that's why he quicklyfixed her marriage with Dr. Neeraj.

800
01:04:12,310 --> 01:04:13,900
I object, your honor.

801
01:04:13,980 --> 01:04:16,350
Bhoomi and Neeraj werehaving a love-marriage.

802
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:22,190
The love between themwas over before the wedding.

803
01:04:22,270 --> 01:04:25,650
Because Bhoomi...who was in love with Vishal.

804
01:04:25,730 --> 01:04:28,440
How can you be so sure?

805
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:30,230
It's not just my belief...

806
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:33,560
In fact, I've evidence and witness.

807
01:04:34,150 --> 01:04:38,690
I saw that this girlhad a rose in her hand.

808
01:04:39,150 --> 01:04:42,020
And she was telling that boy...

809
01:04:42,100 --> 01:04:43,810
...that her wedding's tomorrow.

810
01:04:43,900 --> 01:04:48,480
A girl, who's gettingmarried two days later...

811
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:52,900
...why would she be with another boy,outside her parent's knowledge?

812
01:04:52,980 --> 01:04:57,230
Because... Vishal came to see Bhoomiexactly two days before her wedding...

813
01:04:57,310 --> 01:04:59,650
...so he can propose to her.

814
01:04:59,770 --> 01:05:01,150
Which Bhoomi didn't like.

815
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:03,020
She stepped out to explain him.

816
01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:05,350
Okay.

817
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:09,310
Drink some water.- No.

818
01:05:10,020 --> 01:05:12,350
Drink it.- Thank you, but I don't want to.

819
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:15,100
Just a little.- Why are you forcing me?

820
01:05:15,190 --> 01:05:18,940
To explain you that,if you're not thirsty...

821
01:05:19,020 --> 01:05:24,230
...you won't take this glass ofwater no matter how much I force you.

822
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:27,900
So if Bhoomi didn't love Vishal...

823
01:05:27,980 --> 01:05:31,100
...then, why did shetake the rose from him?

824
01:05:31,310 --> 01:05:33,940
She...- Drink it.

825
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:39,440
You can go now.- Wait!

826
01:05:40,350 --> 01:05:41,600
What did you see next?

827
01:05:41,730 --> 01:05:45,020
That boy was forcefullyholding that girl's hand.

828
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:49,020
And she slapped this boy.

829
01:05:50,650 --> 01:05:52,650
Do you love Bhoomi?- Not at all.

830
01:05:53,270 --> 01:05:54,730
In fact, she loved me.

831
01:05:54,810 --> 01:05:57,020
Then, why are you givingthis red rose to Bhoomi?

832
01:05:57,060 --> 01:06:00,060
Not me, she's giving me the rose.See..

833
01:06:00,100 --> 01:06:05,810
What's more, she even chuckedher wedding ring on my face!

834
01:06:06,020 --> 01:06:08,480
I tried to return it,but she wouldn't take it back.

835
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:11,940
She kept saying thatshe will marry only me.

836
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:16,150
I...thought Bhoomi'scharacter was questionable.

837
01:06:18,810 --> 01:06:23,350
On my wedding night... Bhoomi told me.

838
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:25,230
And what if she hadn't told you?

839
01:06:26,690 --> 01:06:28,520
Then I wouldn't be here...

840
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:30,350
...trying to find answers toquestions on Bhoomi's character...

841
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:32,900
...and, you wouldn't havebeen here answering my questions.

842
01:06:33,940 --> 01:06:36,060
Ms. Nanda,you know that in our country...

843
01:06:36,150 --> 01:06:41,190
...if a girl misses her periods,she can't dare to tell anyone.

844
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:46,310
And rape is something nogirl ever wants to go through...ever!

845
01:06:46,770 --> 01:06:48,230
Isn't it commendable that...

846
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:52,600
...Bhoomi told her futurehusband everything.

847
01:06:54,190 --> 01:07:00,650
Doesn't that prove...that Bhoomi is a nice and honest girl?

848
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:08,460
Your honor,I would like to question Mr. Dhauli.

849
01:07:08,550 --> 01:07:09,550
Please proceed.

850
01:07:09,630 --> 01:07:11,460
So tell me, Dhauli...- Behave!

851
01:07:12,710 --> 01:07:14,130
I am Dhauli.

852
01:07:15,380 --> 01:07:17,250
Show some respect.

853
01:07:17,420 --> 01:07:19,300
Please don't talk about respect.

854
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:21,550
Because you don'tknow what respect is.

855
01:07:21,630 --> 01:07:22,750
Hey lawyer...

856
01:07:23,550 --> 01:07:24,550
Do you know who you're talking to?

857
01:07:24,630 --> 01:07:26,630
Your turn will come soon. Sit down.

858
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:30,460
Just answer my questions.

859
01:07:31,250 --> 01:07:32,550
You see, I am already married.

860
01:07:33,210 --> 01:07:34,500
I also have a kid.

861
01:07:35,420 --> 01:07:37,250
I'm quite happy with my wife.

862
01:07:38,670 --> 01:07:40,170
I love her a lot.

863
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:45,380
Eyeing another girl...

864
01:07:46,630 --> 01:07:47,710
...isn't in my nature.

865
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:53,050
You mean...you weren'tpresent in Bhagwan Theatre...

866
01:07:54,130 --> 01:07:55,170
...where Bhoomi was raped?

867
01:07:55,250 --> 01:07:58,550
Well, how would I knowwhat happens with her and where?

868
01:07:59,210 --> 01:08:00,800
I admit that I own that theatre.

869
01:08:01,460 --> 01:08:03,500
But that doesn'tprove that I raped her.

870
01:08:04,590 --> 01:08:07,670
Your honor,I even own two small hotels.

871
01:08:08,550 --> 01:08:12,880
But I wouldn't knowwhat goes on in every room.

872
01:08:35,150 --> 01:08:37,690
Your honor, according toall the witnesses and evidence...

873
01:08:37,770 --> 01:08:39,150
...I've presented in the court...

874
01:08:39,230 --> 01:08:43,310
...proves that thesethree raped Bhoomi.

875
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:47,690
And this medical report proves...that she wasn't raped at all.

876
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:54,270
'This thing always saves your hide.'

877
01:08:58,230 --> 01:09:02,350
Your honor, the medicalreport has proved everything.

878
01:09:02,940 --> 01:09:06,310
But, in order to know whythis 'rape story' was cooked up...

879
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:10,350
...I would like tocall Agra city's most...

880
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:15,770
...decent and honest girl,Bhoomi Sachdeva...

881
01:09:15,850 --> 01:09:19,810
...to the witness box.- Proceed.

882
01:09:19,940 --> 01:09:23,560
I've heard that alongwith makeup and bridal henna...

883
01:09:24,100 --> 01:09:25,650
...you also plan weddings.

884
01:09:30,310 --> 01:09:33,810
So who taught you to plan rape?

885
01:09:35,310 --> 01:09:36,730
Speak up.

886
01:09:37,850 --> 01:09:45,270
I mean... why plan this rape?

887
01:09:45,690 --> 01:09:50,560
Because Vishal refused to marry you.

888
01:09:51,940 --> 01:09:54,270
And, when you couldn'tdigest this fact...

889
01:09:54,350 --> 01:09:57,440
...you accused him of rape.

890
01:09:58,060 --> 01:10:00,230
And, when he still didn't give in...

891
01:10:00,310 --> 01:10:02,400
...you tried to commit suicide.

892
01:10:03,230 --> 01:10:06,350
And...since Mr. Dhauliis Vishal's cousin.

893
01:10:06,440 --> 01:10:08,600
He spotted Vishal, he stopped...

894
01:10:08,690 --> 01:10:11,230
...and, he even tried to save you.

895
01:10:11,270 --> 01:10:15,060
But you accused himof raping you as well!

896
01:10:15,150 --> 01:10:17,730
Wow...what a story!

897
01:10:18,770 --> 01:10:20,350
Anyway... leave it.

898
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:27,310
Tell me something...were you a virgin before this rape?

899
01:10:30,230 --> 01:10:35,520
Where did these boystouch you while raping you?

900
01:10:38,060 --> 01:10:39,770
Tell me... speak up.

901
01:10:40,310 --> 01:10:43,600
I can ask them, but they might lie.

902
01:10:43,690 --> 01:10:46,100
Why don't you tell me,since they touched you

903
01:10:46,310 --> 01:10:48,100
I'm sure you know better.

904
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:51,310
And, how long did they rape you?

905
01:10:52,850 --> 01:10:54,100
Tell me...

906
01:10:54,350 --> 01:10:55,940
Answer me. Tell me.

907
01:10:57,310 --> 01:10:59,350
Speak up, Bhoomi. Tell us.

908
01:11:00,650 --> 01:11:02,270
I...- No reply.

909
01:11:02,810 --> 01:11:07,480
Look at her stagger while answering.

910
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:09,560
A person only staggerswhen they're lying...

911
01:11:09,650 --> 01:11:12,940
...when they don't have an answer.

912
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:15,100
Leave all that aside, tell me...

913
01:11:15,190 --> 01:11:18,980
...do you do it for money,or for fun? Huh?

914
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:23,020
Your honor, I don't carehow many witnesses testify for her...

915
01:11:23,100 --> 01:11:27,150
...but it will only provethat this case is baseless.

916
01:11:27,190 --> 01:11:31,020
And...Bhoomi Sachdevais characterless.

917
01:11:31,100 --> 01:11:33,730
Enough! Enough!

918
01:11:34,900 --> 01:11:38,060
Madam, enough!

919
01:11:39,270 --> 01:11:41,440
I've heard enough!

920
01:11:47,100 --> 01:11:49,060
Come on. Let's go...

921
01:11:49,150 --> 01:11:51,560
You cannot insult the court like this.

922
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:57,440
I am insulting the court?

923
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:04,100
My daughter was calledso many things in your court.

924
01:12:04,690 --> 01:12:06,270
Isn't that her insult?

925
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:09,980
Whether she was a virginbefore the rape or not?

926
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:17,100
Since you called her characterless,there's no room for this question?

927
01:12:17,150 --> 01:12:19,230
Arun, please sit down.- Quiet.

928
01:12:21,850 --> 01:12:24,270
Who raped her first?

929
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:26,270
How does it matter?

930
01:12:26,350 --> 01:12:28,810
Whether it was him, him, or him?

931
01:12:28,900 --> 01:12:30,940
How does it matter?

932
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:35,270
Who touched him?

933
01:12:37,060 --> 01:12:39,440
She's a characterless girl.

934
01:12:40,350 --> 01:12:42,810
Doesn't matter who touched her!

935
01:12:45,060 --> 01:12:47,020
You should be ashamed.

936
01:12:47,100 --> 01:12:49,900
I came here seeking justicefor my daughter, not...

937
01:12:49,980 --> 01:12:55,560
Not to get her raped again.

938
01:12:55,850 --> 01:12:59,310
Please come in the witnessbox and say what you have to say.

939
01:13:01,940 --> 01:13:07,480
Your honor, a witnesstestifies in the witness box...

940
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:14,310
...but, a father can stand anywhereand testify for her daughter.

941
01:13:18,100 --> 01:13:19,730
How did you become a lawyer?

942
01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:22,600
By studying law.

943
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:27,980
But you were born as a woman first.

944
01:13:29,190 --> 01:13:31,900
You called her characterless.

945
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:36,730
That means you called everywoman in this world characterless...

946
01:13:36,810 --> 01:13:39,560
...who works and comes home late.

947
01:13:41,940 --> 01:13:44,150
On the day of her wedding...

948
01:13:44,230 --> 01:13:48,230
...she told her would-behusband that she was raped.

949
01:13:48,310 --> 01:13:52,900
She doesn't want to deceive him,because...

950
01:13:55,190 --> 01:13:59,900
These three touched her...raped her...

951
01:13:59,980 --> 01:14:01,900
Now I understand why?

952
01:14:01,980 --> 01:14:05,650
Because...she's a characterless girl.

953
01:14:08,150 --> 01:14:10,060
She's a characterless girl!

954
01:14:10,310 --> 01:14:14,850
You've been raped...at least you're not dead!

955
01:14:22,770 --> 01:14:25,100
At least you're not dead, dear.

956
01:14:56,810 --> 01:15:02,230
Dhauli, Vishal, Ghulam.

957
01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:07,060
Please forgive us!

958
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:09,310
We will withdraw this case.

959
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:25,480
She might be the apple of your eye...

960
01:15:27,190 --> 01:15:29,520
...but, she's just a toy for me.

961
01:15:30,940 --> 01:15:32,810
Better explain her...

962
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:36,600
Not wander out at nights.

963
01:15:37,940 --> 01:15:40,600
As much as i am out of land

964
01:15:42,190 --> 01:15:44,440
Equally within the land

965
01:15:59,850 --> 01:16:01,850
Forgive me, dear.

966
01:16:08,150 --> 01:16:09,900
Forgive me.

967
01:16:12,730 --> 01:16:14,230
Forgive me.

968
01:16:15,190 --> 01:16:20,560
"Beloved..."

969
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:29,020
"Beloved..."

970
01:16:29,980 --> 01:16:31,350
"I cried once..."

971
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:33,020
"I cried a hundred times..."

972
01:16:33,060 --> 01:16:41,560
"Now my eyes have dried up."

973
01:16:41,690 --> 01:16:43,060
"I cried once..."

974
01:16:43,150 --> 01:16:44,520
"I cried a hundred times..."

975
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:47,350
"Now my eyes are upset."

976
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:50,310
"Tears overflowed...and flowed from every inch..."

977
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:53,230
"Now my eyes are upset."

978
01:16:54,190 --> 01:17:00,020
"My dreams were shattered..."

979
01:17:00,100 --> 01:17:05,650
"...as my soul's been tainted."

980
01:17:05,810 --> 01:17:11,690
"Beloved...I can'twash this taint off."

981
01:17:11,770 --> 01:17:17,020
"Beloved...I can'twash this taint off."

982
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:23,310
"My dreams were shattered..."

983
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:29,230
"...as I was tainted."

984
01:17:29,310 --> 01:17:34,810
"I can't wash off this taint off,beloved."

985
01:17:44,730 --> 01:17:47,190
I didn't realize whenyou left in the morning, dear.

986
01:17:47,560 --> 01:17:48,230
I didn't get up.

987
01:17:48,310 --> 01:17:49,650
It's alright, papa.

988
01:17:49,730 --> 01:17:52,270
Well, I'll talk to you later.

989
01:17:52,350 --> 01:17:53,730
I still have to do the bride's makeup.

990
01:17:53,810 --> 01:17:55,020
Yeah...coming.

991
01:18:17,940 --> 01:18:24,150
"The memories of thoselanes and the terraces."

992
01:18:29,730 --> 01:18:35,440
"The memories of thoselanes and the terraces."

993
01:18:35,560 --> 01:18:41,310
"Often keeps talkingwith those images."

994
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:44,190
"I wish my wandering memories..."

995
01:18:44,270 --> 01:18:47,100
"...finally find a refuge."

996
01:18:47,190 --> 01:18:52,940
"I want these paperboats...to find shores."

997
01:18:53,020 --> 01:18:59,440
"But my heart's scared...that the deluge might wash it away."

998
01:19:01,900 --> 01:19:03,850
Why don't you just say that...

999
01:19:03,940 --> 01:19:05,600
...you gave the job to someoneelse because I was raped.

1000
01:19:05,690 --> 01:19:11,310
"Beloved...I can'twash this taint off."

1001
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:16,730
"Beloved...I can'twash this taint off."

1002
01:19:17,190 --> 01:19:22,770
"Beloved...I can'twash this taint off."

1003
01:19:28,020 --> 01:19:29,650
Late again, papa.

1004
01:19:29,650 --> 01:19:31,100
I was really busy today, dear.

1005
01:19:31,810 --> 01:19:33,900
I had so many customersat the shop today...

1006
01:19:33,900 --> 01:19:34,770
...which is why I got late.

1007
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:37,600
Okay, let's finish praying

1008
01:19:43,150 --> 01:19:47,060
"Glory to Lord Ganesha."

1009
01:19:47,560 --> 01:19:51,150
"Son of Parvati and Lord Mahadeva."

1010
01:19:51,690 --> 01:19:55,730
"Bless the blind with sight,and the sick with Your grace."

1011
01:19:55,730 --> 01:19:58,350
"The barren with..."

1012
01:20:00,020 --> 01:20:01,310
"The barren with..."

1013
01:20:04,650 --> 01:20:08,560
"The barren with sons,and the poor with Your grace."

1014
01:20:08,810 --> 01:20:13,310
"Bless all thosewho seek your refuge."

1015
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:17,310
"Glory to Lord Ganesha."

1016
01:20:28,230 --> 01:20:31,150
Diya has given the responsibilityof Shiroz Cafe to me.

1017
01:20:32,190 --> 01:20:33,350
It's a lot...- Papa...

1018
01:20:34,350 --> 01:20:35,980
It's a lot of responsibility.

1019
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:38,190
I won't get any time for myself.

1020
01:20:49,100 --> 01:20:53,270
Papa, please don't cry.

1021
01:20:54,150 --> 01:20:54,770
No, dear.

1022
01:20:57,190 --> 01:20:58,850
You put too much spice.

1023
01:21:01,480 --> 01:21:04,150
There's no spice in porridge, papa.

1024
01:21:08,310 --> 01:21:11,520
How long are you goingto pretend to be happy?

1025
01:21:12,440 --> 01:21:15,560
And you... What haveyou been doing, dear?

1026
01:21:16,150 --> 01:21:19,350
I...am trying to live my life again.

1027
01:21:21,310 --> 01:21:23,230
And those who should'veended up dead...

1028
01:21:23,980 --> 01:21:25,600
...are still alive.

1029
01:21:27,650 --> 01:21:31,520
What will you do? Kill them.

1030
01:21:32,350 --> 01:21:33,810
What's done is done.

1031
01:21:33,900 --> 01:21:38,310
There's no point in worrying.- Yeah... no point at all, dear.

1032
01:21:39,020 --> 01:21:40,900
There's no point at all, dear.

1033
01:21:41,940 --> 01:21:44,560
The guys who did thisare least concerned...

1034
01:21:44,690 --> 01:21:46,230
...so why should I be?

1035
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:51,980
A father need not beconcerned for his daughter.

1036
01:21:52,060 --> 01:21:55,650
You don't have to be...because I've only been raped.

1037
01:21:55,730 --> 01:21:57,770
I am not dead!- What did you say?

1038
01:21:58,440 --> 01:21:59,850
What did you say?

1039
01:22:01,810 --> 01:22:07,190
Girls that get raped,don't have a right to live, right?

1040
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:09,560
Why?

1041
01:22:11,730 --> 01:22:15,350
A common man tried to take thehelp of the law and make a change...

1042
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:16,690
...but nothing happened.

1043
01:22:16,850 --> 01:22:18,060
So what now?

1044
01:22:18,980 --> 01:22:23,230
Start a candle march.

1045
01:22:23,310 --> 01:22:28,190
Or...let's immolate ourselvesand say that we didn't get justice.

1046
01:22:32,900 --> 01:22:37,520
I cannot change the way people think,and I cannot change the law.

1047
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:41,150
But I can try to live with pride.

1048
01:22:43,810 --> 01:22:49,480
Your daughter doesn'twant you to see you lose hope.

1049
01:22:50,850 --> 01:22:53,650
I can't bear it.

1050
01:22:55,730 --> 01:22:57,480
Papa...

1051
01:23:00,810 --> 01:23:02,850
...I've forgotten everything.

1052
01:23:03,150 --> 01:23:05,020
In fact, everyone's forgotten.

1053
01:23:05,810 --> 01:23:09,480
The newspaper, media,neighbours, relatives...everyone.

1054
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:17,730
You should forget too, please.

1055
01:23:20,810 --> 01:23:22,770
Please, papa.

1056
01:23:26,850 --> 01:23:28,060
Please.

1057
01:24:50,270 --> 01:24:51,440
Bhoomi.

1058
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:53,310
Bhoomi.

1059
01:24:53,400 --> 01:24:56,810
Come with me... Come with me...

1060
01:24:57,150 --> 01:24:58,480
I've come to take you back.

1061
01:24:58,560 --> 01:24:59,230
Come on...

1062
01:24:59,310 --> 01:25:00,770
Wipe it off...

1063
01:25:03,230 --> 01:25:06,600
Wipe it off... Wipe it off...

1064
01:25:09,690 --> 01:25:11,060
Wipe it off...

1065
01:25:11,100 --> 01:25:12,350
Wipe it off...

1066
01:25:14,020 --> 01:25:15,190
Wipe it off...

1067
01:25:21,980 --> 01:25:25,230
Not the wall... That taint on my fate.

1068
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:27,020
I tried meeting you.

1069
01:25:29,020 --> 01:25:35,150
But then you felt embarrassed.What are the people going to say?

1070
01:25:35,900 --> 01:25:37,770
If only I thought like that...

1071
01:25:37,850 --> 01:25:39,480
...I would've never told you anything.

1072
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:42,480
I trusted you.

1073
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:47,350
Come on.

1074
01:25:47,440 --> 01:25:49,730
Let's.... go, please forgive me.

1075
01:27:01,730 --> 01:27:04,900
They haven't forgotten, papa.

1076
01:27:06,900 --> 01:27:09,230
They haven't forgotten, papa.

1077
01:27:09,940 --> 01:27:12,100
They haven't forgotten, papa.

1078
01:27:28,020 --> 01:27:30,770
One girl is bringing suchshame to the entire neighborhood.

1079
01:27:31,400 --> 01:27:33,190
You should read thearticles in the newspapers.

1080
01:27:33,270 --> 01:27:36,150
Such people shouldleave the neighborhood.

1081
01:28:11,270 --> 01:28:15,940
Bhoomi is bringing shame tothe entire neighborhood, isn't she?

1082
01:28:20,060 --> 01:28:21,730
To hell with this neighborhood.

1083
01:28:22,060 --> 01:28:23,520
Saraswat!

1084
01:28:25,150 --> 01:28:26,190
How can you forget?

1085
01:28:27,270 --> 01:28:32,060
When your daughter fell fromthe terrace and broke her leg...

1086
01:28:33,150 --> 01:28:35,810
...who took her to the doctor?

1087
01:28:36,850 --> 01:28:38,190
Bhoomi did.

1088
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:43,480
Back then you said, "Everyoneshould have a daughter like her".

1089
01:28:44,810 --> 01:28:47,310
And now, when my daughter'sbeen through such an ordeal...

1090
01:28:48,150 --> 01:28:50,810
...she's bringing shameto this neighborhood. Huh!

1091
01:28:50,900 --> 01:28:52,520
You...

1092
01:28:54,270 --> 01:28:56,230
Bloody Turncoats...

1093
01:29:00,900 --> 01:29:03,100
Gopi...

1094
01:29:03,730 --> 01:29:08,230
When your younger brotherthrew your parents out of the house...

1095
01:29:10,230 --> 01:29:12,980
...that didn't bringshame to this neighborhood.

1096
01:29:13,350 --> 01:29:14,900
Why not?

1097
01:29:16,100 --> 01:29:17,520
Because that was your personal matter.

1098
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:21,350
It didn't come in the papers. Huh!

1099
01:29:26,690 --> 01:29:28,770
Arun. Arun.

1100
01:29:28,850 --> 01:29:30,900
Arun.Come on, let's go home.

1101
01:29:30,980 --> 01:29:35,770
Bhoomi was born in this neighborhood,and she grew up here.

1102
01:29:35,940 --> 01:29:37,730
You all should be ashamed.

1103
01:29:37,770 --> 01:29:41,900
You guys wrote hernumber on the wall. Huh!

1104
01:29:42,310 --> 01:29:45,850
I will break down allthe walls in this neighborhood.

1105
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:48,650
When there will be no neighborhood...

1106
01:29:48,730 --> 01:29:50,440
...no one will feel humiliated.

1107
01:29:52,150 --> 01:29:54,270
Come on, that's the way they are.

1108
01:29:57,850 --> 01:29:59,270
Bunch of cowards...

1109
01:29:59,350 --> 01:30:02,060
All you can do is watch, listen...

1110
01:30:02,150 --> 01:30:03,940
...and one day you will die.

1111
01:30:19,770 --> 01:30:23,150
Everyone's been quietsince you all got here.

1112
01:30:23,230 --> 01:30:24,770
What's the matter?

1113
01:30:24,850 --> 01:30:26,020
Why are you here?

1114
01:30:26,100 --> 01:30:27,310
Sister...

1115
01:30:28,980 --> 01:30:31,850
Jeetu's phone.

1116
01:30:51,940 --> 01:30:53,150
Listen.- Yes.

1117
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:54,730
Take Vishal home.

1118
01:30:55,100 --> 01:30:56,440
Turn off that mobile.- Yeah.

1119
01:31:28,730 --> 01:31:30,560
I cannot even ask for forgiveness.

1120
01:31:31,770 --> 01:31:34,980
Brother, I'll talk to Vishal.

1121
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:37,060
But please...

1122
01:32:04,020 --> 01:32:05,150
'Sister Bhoomi...'

1123
01:32:05,230 --> 01:32:07,190
'Coming, sister.'

1124
01:32:07,270 --> 01:32:08,310
'Sorry I am late. '

1125
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:10,060
'At least smile for me.'

1126
01:32:10,150 --> 01:32:12,190
'Sorry, sister.'

1127
01:32:13,730 --> 01:32:15,650
Kill them, father.

1128
01:32:21,940 --> 01:32:25,940
Not me... Us!

1129
01:32:40,980 --> 01:32:42,150
Where were you?

1130
01:32:42,230 --> 01:32:44,060
You never showed such concern before?

1131
01:32:44,150 --> 01:32:45,520
So why ask today?

1132
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:46,440
Come on.

1133
01:32:46,520 --> 01:32:48,310
How could you do something so cheap?

1134
01:32:48,560 --> 01:32:49,980
I said I didn't do anything.

1135
01:32:50,060 --> 01:32:51,480
Open the door, Sara!

1136
01:32:53,400 --> 01:32:54,690
Open.- No!

1137
01:32:54,810 --> 01:32:56,730
We're scared to livewith a father like you.

1138
01:32:57,690 --> 01:33:01,190
I am Dhauli...I will kill her.

1139
01:33:01,270 --> 01:33:03,350
He must be thinkingabout doing the same thing.

1140
01:33:07,770 --> 01:33:08,900
Come on...

1141
01:33:08,940 --> 01:33:10,940
Go and surrenderyourself to the police.

1142
01:33:11,020 --> 01:33:12,810
Come on.- Why should I surrender myself?

1143
01:33:12,900 --> 01:33:15,350
He will kill you.Why don't you get it?

1144
01:33:24,690 --> 01:33:27,520
U...U...Uncle, you?

1145
01:33:32,650 --> 01:33:34,810
What...what... what did I do?

1146
01:33:38,230 --> 01:33:39,850
Sheroes Cafe.

1147
01:33:42,190 --> 01:33:43,980
'Sister, just eat this sweetmeat.'

1148
01:33:44,060 --> 01:33:44,770
'Take it.'

1149
01:33:44,850 --> 01:33:46,600
Making excuse to stop your bike.

1150
01:33:46,940 --> 01:33:48,150
'Sister Bhoomi.'

1151
01:33:53,270 --> 01:33:54,100
Police Station.

1152
01:33:54,190 --> 01:33:55,190
'Hello, Vishal.'

1153
01:33:55,440 --> 01:33:57,980
'We're at the police station,to lodge a complaint.'

1154
01:33:59,900 --> 01:34:02,690
Calling Dhauli from the hospital.

1155
01:34:03,020 --> 01:34:04,690
'Bhoomi is alive.'

1156
01:34:12,730 --> 01:34:14,900
It will take me onlya second to kill you.

1157
01:34:16,940 --> 01:34:21,850
But no, I will killyou slowly...every day.

1158
01:34:22,810 --> 01:34:24,400
Every second...

1159
01:34:26,480 --> 01:34:28,480
The law of our country...

1160
01:34:28,560 --> 01:34:31,940
...doesn't punish anyoffender who's under 18.

1161
01:34:34,020 --> 01:34:36,520
Soon you will turn 18.

1162
01:34:37,440 --> 01:34:38,810
Adult...

1163
01:34:43,770 --> 01:34:45,650
And then we'll punish you.

1164
01:34:47,480 --> 01:34:49,850
Forgive me, sister!

1165
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:52,190
Forgive me, sister!

1166
01:34:54,900 --> 01:34:59,730
Don't ever call anyone 'sister'again with your filthy mouth.

1167
01:35:00,900 --> 01:35:03,900
Uncle, forgive me.

1168
01:35:07,560 --> 01:35:09,100
Brother, Vishal.- Yeah.

1169
01:35:09,190 --> 01:35:11,900
Why did you shift all thestuff from that shop to this one?

1170
01:35:12,060 --> 01:35:12,810
Just like that.

1171
01:35:12,900 --> 01:35:15,100
Go deliver the goods.- Yes, on my way.

1172
01:36:06,770 --> 01:36:09,310
Do you know what's the punishment...

1173
01:36:10,190 --> 01:36:13,560
...for such a despicableact in other countries?

1174
01:36:24,600 --> 01:36:28,900
In Iran... you'd be publicly hanged.

1175
01:36:32,150 --> 01:36:37,270
In Afghanistan...you'd be shot at point blank.

1176
01:36:48,270 --> 01:36:53,600
In Saudi Arabia...you'd be beheaded.

1177
01:36:56,100 --> 01:37:00,480
In China...they shoot the spinal cord.

1178
01:37:03,150 --> 01:37:07,310
And in Korea,even after the person's dead...

1179
01:37:07,400 --> 01:37:10,600
...they shoot him in the chest.

1180
01:37:18,600 --> 01:37:25,020
You're absolutely safe here,until you don't turn 18.

1181
01:37:25,770 --> 01:37:27,310
18 years

1182
01:37:27,730 --> 01:37:29,270
18 years

1183
01:37:35,690 --> 01:37:36,480
Great...

1184
01:37:36,480 --> 01:37:38,100
Just great.- I see...

1185
01:37:45,400 --> 01:37:45,980
Here.

1186
01:37:45,980 --> 01:37:47,810
Take your change.- No, keep it.

1187
01:37:55,900 --> 01:37:57,600
I'll collect my bike tomorrow.- Okay, brother.

1188
01:39:01,980 --> 01:39:03,520
Is everything alright, brother Vishal?

1189
01:39:04,230 --> 01:39:07,310
Yes...everything's alright.

1190
01:39:15,350 --> 01:39:16,520
I said everything's alright.

1191
01:39:18,520 --> 01:39:20,150
You don't sound alright.

1192
01:39:56,600 --> 01:39:58,020
Apologize.

1193
01:40:01,810 --> 01:40:05,440
Stop hiding and apologize.

1194
01:40:09,980 --> 01:40:13,060
Sorry, Bhoomi

1195
01:40:13,600 --> 01:40:14,900
Not like that.

1196
01:40:15,310 --> 01:40:17,190
On your knees...come on.

1197
01:40:21,060 --> 01:40:22,270
See...he apologized.

1198
01:40:22,850 --> 01:40:23,980
Enough...

1199
01:40:24,060 --> 01:40:25,270
Get up.

1200
01:40:27,150 --> 01:40:30,060
Poor boy didn't cry thismuch even at his father's funeral.

1201
01:40:31,400 --> 01:40:33,850
And you've been scaringhim out of his wits every day.

1202
01:40:35,150 --> 01:40:36,770
The boy made a mistake.

1203
01:40:38,310 --> 01:40:40,060
I didn't attend school for too long.

1204
01:40:40,480 --> 01:40:41,770
But, I do know...

1205
01:40:42,100 --> 01:40:45,440
One should forgive and forget.

1206
01:40:46,310 --> 01:40:48,650
This is your chance to forgivehim and be the greater man.

1207
01:40:55,900 --> 01:40:57,980
Let's not take thismatter any further.

1208
01:41:00,810 --> 01:41:03,480
What's the problem?

1209
01:41:05,600 --> 01:41:06,770
I see...

1210
01:41:08,400 --> 01:41:11,520
Who's going to accept such a girl?Who's going to marry her?

1211
01:41:12,230 --> 01:41:13,810
He will... him.

1212
01:41:14,310 --> 01:41:16,560
I'll arrange for a grand wedding.Don't worry.

1213
01:41:16,900 --> 01:41:20,850
Come on...take your futurefather-in-law's blessing.

1214
01:41:21,350 --> 01:41:22,440
Go on.

1215
01:41:22,650 --> 01:41:24,190
Bless him.

1216
01:41:33,770 --> 01:41:36,440
I didn't like yourstyle of blessing him.

1217
01:41:38,400 --> 01:41:40,690
I don't think you wantto see your daughter get married.

1218
01:41:53,440 --> 01:41:55,600
I guess the Law's alwayssupposed to let go.

1219
01:41:56,350 --> 01:41:59,770
Don't try anything like you did today?

1220
01:42:10,940 --> 01:42:12,940
Whenever Dhauli and Holi arrives...

1221
01:42:13,560 --> 01:42:15,310
...the air's covered with red color.

1222
01:42:17,020 --> 01:42:18,400
He's really lucky.

1223
01:42:19,310 --> 01:42:22,350
I never shed any bloodin the month of 'Shradh'.

1224
01:42:23,310 --> 01:42:26,310
Otherwise, there would'vebeen one less father in this world.

1225
01:42:26,940 --> 01:42:28,270
Hey...

1226
01:42:35,690 --> 01:42:38,350
Go and perform yourlast 'Shradh' Dhauli.

1227
01:42:39,600 --> 01:42:43,150
Because,after this nothing can save you.

1228
01:42:46,190 --> 01:42:48,520
There's a saying in Dholpur.

1229
01:42:49,440 --> 01:42:50,850
"Save the Water."

1230
01:42:52,310 --> 01:42:54,190
Now there's going tobe a saying famous in Agra.

1231
01:42:55,230 --> 01:42:57,270
"Save the Daughter."

1232
01:43:03,190 --> 01:43:05,850
Sir, here are the bail papers.- Sit-sit.

1233
01:43:05,940 --> 01:43:07,150
Thank you.

1234
01:43:10,980 --> 01:43:12,310
Come.

1235
01:43:18,730 --> 01:43:20,270
By the way,Jeetu's been missing for few days.

1236
01:43:20,350 --> 01:43:23,230
He used to work with Bhoomi.Any news about him.

1237
01:43:30,600 --> 01:43:32,770
Uncle...no...

1238
01:43:37,560 --> 01:43:41,310
Uncle...uncle...Uncle, please... Uncle...

1239
01:44:13,440 --> 01:44:15,310
Forgive me.Forgive me, please.

1240
01:44:15,400 --> 01:44:16,560
Let me go.

1241
01:44:16,900 --> 01:44:19,020
Let me go, please.

1242
01:44:24,100 --> 01:44:25,270
Now you know...

1243
01:44:26,150 --> 01:44:29,270
...how it feels when someonetries to force your hand.

1244
01:44:29,600 --> 01:44:31,850
Papa, he's turned 18 today.

1245
01:44:50,440 --> 01:44:52,100
Let me go.

1246
01:44:53,400 --> 01:44:57,650
Sister Bhoomi...Forgive me. Let me go.

1247
01:44:58,310 --> 01:45:00,690
Let me... let... let me go.

1248
01:45:00,770 --> 01:45:05,730
Let me go! Forgive me.Let me go.

1249
01:45:07,350 --> 01:45:09,520
Forgive me, uncle.- Cut the cake.

1250
01:45:09,600 --> 01:45:12,270
No, uncle...no.

1251
01:45:18,230 --> 01:45:19,850
Forgive...forgive me.

1252
01:45:19,980 --> 01:45:22,270
Cut it!- Uncle, forgive me.

1253
01:45:22,350 --> 01:45:25,650
Let me go. Let me go.- Cut the cake!

1254
01:45:49,020 --> 01:45:50,520
Happy birthday!

1255
01:45:52,190 --> 01:45:54,600
You guys were sayingthat you'll find him.

1256
01:45:54,690 --> 01:45:56,690
But he's...

1257
01:46:00,100 --> 01:46:01,520
Is this Jeetus's handwriting?

1258
01:46:11,980 --> 01:46:13,100
Yes!

1259
01:46:17,730 --> 01:46:20,100
You don't look too sadabout your brother's death.

1260
01:46:20,440 --> 01:46:24,900
That sad part isthat he was my brother.

1261
01:46:29,650 --> 01:46:33,650
Baby...why don't we get married?

1262
01:46:34,060 --> 01:46:36,150
Then we won't haveto hurry up...ever again.

1263
01:46:39,770 --> 01:46:41,060
Now, let's go.

1264
01:46:41,150 --> 01:46:42,560
What do you mean?

1265
01:46:43,400 --> 01:46:45,480
What about our love...this tattoo?

1266
01:46:46,810 --> 01:46:49,150
You see...people maketattoos of their love.

1267
01:46:50,230 --> 01:46:54,560
But only Ghulam makestattoo of the fun he has!

1268
01:47:37,690 --> 01:47:43,600
You like tattooing yourname on women's body, don't you?

1269
01:47:44,900 --> 01:47:48,690
Let me help you.- No...

1270
01:48:12,480 --> 01:48:15,650
I can kill you right now.

1271
01:48:16,020 --> 01:48:19,560
But no...you got to live like this.

1272
01:48:20,350 --> 01:48:22,270
Like this.

1273
01:48:25,560 --> 01:48:31,230
R-A...P-I—S-T.

1274
01:48:31,350 --> 01:48:32,520
RAPIST.

1275
01:48:33,440 --> 01:48:35,480
His spelling's perfect.

1276
01:48:36,310 --> 01:48:38,440
Guess that shoe-seller been to school.

1277
01:48:39,440 --> 01:48:43,690
'Ghulam'...I knew everyone'sdestiny was written on his forehead.

1278
01:48:44,270 --> 01:48:47,230
But, I had no clueit was written in English.

1279
01:48:48,810 --> 01:48:50,150
You think this is funny.

1280
01:48:50,230 --> 01:48:51,650
Do you?

1281
01:48:54,560 --> 01:48:56,850
Fire is a funny thing...

1282
01:48:57,480 --> 01:48:59,270
Only takes a coupleof words to start it...

1283
01:49:00,350 --> 01:49:02,480
Don't worry,once the 'Shradh' is over...

1284
01:49:02,560 --> 01:49:05,520
No Dhauli, he will kill me.- Shut up!

1285
01:49:06,440 --> 01:49:07,980
I'll slap you.

1286
01:49:08,900 --> 01:49:10,400
This is Dholpur.

1287
01:49:10,730 --> 01:49:13,560
Nothing happens here...without my will.

1288
01:49:13,650 --> 01:49:15,480
You don't get it.He will kill me.

1289
01:49:15,560 --> 01:49:16,980
That Jeetu...

1290
01:49:17,100 --> 01:49:20,100
He committed suicide because of him.

1291
01:49:20,190 --> 01:49:21,730
He didn't commit suicide.

1292
01:49:21,810 --> 01:49:23,650
That bloody Arun killed him.

1293
01:49:24,060 --> 01:49:26,690
I will kill him.- No one will touch him.

1294
01:49:28,350 --> 01:49:31,900
How and when he's gonna die...

1295
01:49:34,400 --> 01:49:37,230
Dhauli will decideonce 'Shradh' is over.

1296
01:49:37,520 --> 01:49:39,020
Dhauli!

1297
01:49:50,810 --> 01:49:53,650
Jeetu's dead body wasfound in Bhagwan Talkies.

1298
01:49:53,770 --> 01:49:55,440
You must play the match carefully.

1299
01:49:56,480 --> 01:49:58,270
After you win the match...

1300
01:49:59,060 --> 01:50:02,150
...don't leave any of yourbelonging on the ground.

1301
01:50:04,600 --> 01:50:05,810
Okay.

1302
01:50:30,440 --> 01:50:33,310

...and his daughter, Bhoomi Sachdeva,in Agra's Belganj area.

1313

First talk to your father.

1320
01:51:47,400 --> 01:51:49,900

This time he got lucky...But next time he won't.

01:52:07,150 --> 01:52:08,310
Don't forget to tell him that...

1326
01:52:08,810 --> 01:52:10,600
...if you survive.

1327
01:52:16,400 --> 01:52:23,020
Arun, let's have...a small one.

1328
01:52:29,810 --> 01:52:33,400

You didn't touch the drink,or me all night.

1331
01:53:25,020 --> 01:53:26,600
You want to drink.

Lucknow! Lucknow!

1341
01:58:01,060 --> 01:58:05,480
Every day,some boy proposes to some girl.

1342
01:58:07,270 --> 01:58:10,190
If that girl says no...

1343
01:58:12,400 --> 01:58:16,440
...will those boys rape them.

1344
01:58:16,810 --> 01:58:19,600
Please forgive me. Forgive me.

1345
01:58:20,480 --> 01:58:21,310

Please...

1356
01:59:59,980 --> 02:00:01,730
It's a good thing you killed him.

1357
02:00:02,440 --> 02:00:03,980
He was scared of dying.

1358
02:00:05,060 --> 02:00:08,400
And those who are scared of dying,have no right to live.

1359
02:00:08,810 --> 02:00:10,730
You're not scared of dying, are you?

1360
02:00:12,230 --> 02:00:14,730
Dhauli cannot be scared.

1361
02:00:21,060 --> 02:00:23,400
