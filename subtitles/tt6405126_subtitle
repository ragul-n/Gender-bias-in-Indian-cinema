1
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,440
Look at poor Mike.

2
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,400
How he's looking at you
like a lovesick puppy.

3
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:10,240
Poor Mike, he didn't even survive
your one-year relationship curse.

4
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,700
Six months.

5
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,410
Tell me something,
what's going on with your apartment?

6
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,360
My loan is almost approved.

7
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:20,950
I'm going there today.

8
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:23,070
Leaving early.
- Where is it?

9
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,740
It's in Duluth,
near the Italian hotel Fredrico's.

10
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,660
It must have cost you a bomb.

11
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:31,070
700,000 dollars
is market cost.

12
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,990
But I'm getting it
for 400,000.

13
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,240
How?
- Minority housing.

14
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:38,700
Praful, you are one
hundred percent Gujarati!

15
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,660
Hello! I've worked hard for it,
for seven years.

16
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:43,070
And you don't have any kids.

17
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,320
I have parents!

18
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,740
Why isn't 503 cleaned?

19
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:51,490
503 had a 'Do Not Disturb' board.

20
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,320
No worries.

21
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:56,320
Just telling that you that they
called and I had Thelma clean it up.

22
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,280
No... we were having lunch,
they must have removed the board.

23
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:02,150
Sorry.

24
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:04,550
Well then,
why don't I just join you guys...

25
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,000
Who is calling me?

26
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,910
Have a nice lunch, ladies.
- Thank you.

27
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:14,950
Praful!

28
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,990
Paradise awaits me

29
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:25,700
And beckons
With open arms

30
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:30,330
Dear Life

31
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:37,530
Now break the shackles
and live a little...

32
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,980
Dear Life

33
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:42,570
Very nice, eh?

34
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,280
Yeah?

35
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,450
There's lots of sunlight
coming in through that window there.

36
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:49,780
And there's a park out front.

37
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:53,160
So, no chance of a building
popping up, blocking your view.

38
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,200
And there's an Indian
temple right around the block.

39
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,260
Indian temple?

40
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,200
Oh... That is a Gurudwara.

41
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,450
We are Hindus.

42
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:01,660
That is for Sikhs.

43
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,530
Oh okay.

44
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:07,060
Oh, there's an Indian
Kebab place two blocks away.

45
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,660
But I am a vegetarian.

46
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:11,280
Oh. Okay.
Vegetarian!

47
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,660
Right! Well...

48
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,780
You know what,
let me help you with that.

49
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,160
It's kinda tricky.

50
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,910
You gotta have the magic touch.

51
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:20,990
There you go.
- Thank you.

52
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,950
You're welcome.
And I'll see you outside.

53
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:29,220
Break the shackles and fly away...

54
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:35,530
Spread your wings and fly away...

55
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:41,390
Break the shackles and fly away...

56
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:48,720
Spread your wings and fly away...

57
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:05,330
Break the shackles and fly away...

58
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:07,410
This apartment is a steal, Ms. Patel.

59
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:10,910
Just yesterday,
we sold a place for 800,000 dollars.

60
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:12,360
I know. My...

61
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:17,950
My mortgage should
come through by next week.

62
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:18,990
Okay, great.

63
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:22,660
So I'll draw up the paperwork and how
about we meet in my office on Monday?

64
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:23,950
Yes.
- Okay.

65
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:25,970
Thank you.
- Thank you, Mr. Steven.

66
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:27,180
Have a good day.

67
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,090
Hello... Hello, Ms. Julie.
- Hi.

68
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,760
I'm here to meet Ms. Cynthia.

69
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:45,840
Please tell her.
- Okay. I'll let her know you're here.

70
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:46,680
I'm waiting here.

71
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,090
Okay.
- My name is Praful Patel.

72
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,050
Gotcha.

73
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:54,630
Hey Cynthia, your appointment is here.

74
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,510
Okay, I'll let her know.

75
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,800
Ms. Patel, Cynthia will see you now.
- Thank you.

76
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:15,050
Ma'am, if you can process
my loan little quickly.

77
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,090
I have two weeks...

78
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:18,760
Well, it's good that you got a pre
approval on the mortgage. - Yes.

79
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,840
It shouldn't be a problem.

80
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:23,800
I just need to check your
credit scores and we should be fine.

81
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:25,350
This is my...
- Alright.

82
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:28,180
I just need you to sign this.

83
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,260
And this.

84
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:31,680
And...

85
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,090
This.

86
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:34,720
Can I borrow your pen?
- Yes.

87
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,590
Over here?
- Yes.

88
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:41,220
Alright, I'll call you on Monday.

89
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,880
Alright! Okay.

90
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,010
Thank you.

91
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,180
One margherita pizza please.

92
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:53,430
And... garlic bread also.

93
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:54,890
Hello, Amber...

94
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:57,090
Sorry, I missed all your calls.

95
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:58,920
I've been quite busy.

96
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,840
So tell me, all the preparations
for the wedding going smooth...

97
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,650
My To-be-bride?

98
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:04,380
Listen Praf, you have to come
to Las Vegas with me.

99
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:05,880
Las Vegas? What for?

100
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:09,040
Nothing. We'll shop,
Like a bachelorette.

101
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:09,930
Just you and me.

102
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:11,130
Bachelorette?

103
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,410
With me?

104
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,800
Wendy and other
friends are not coming?

105
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:17,880
No Praf, it's just you and me.

106
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:20,470
That is sweet.

107
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:24,200
But Amber,
I'm kind of saving up for my house.

108
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,940
So, I won't be able to spend much...

109
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:29,090
Hey, I'm paying for the trip.
You're coming for free!

110
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,050
Really?

111
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:32,080
Las Vegas for free!

112
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,050
Good offer.

113
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:34,840
But...

114
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,220
But I can't.

115
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:38,590
I won't be able to make it.

116
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,130
Praf...

117
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,720
No way... Not again!

118
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:53,430
What problem do you
have with my flowers?

119
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:55,010
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
- You destroy them every day!

120
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:56,340
I've got margherita pizza for you.

121
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:57,930
Lock the car.
Come in.

122
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:00,180
You should go back to the driving school.
- Come on! Come on! Come on!

123
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,340
Oh wow!

124
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,680
Just what I had in mind!

125
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,010
I've been craving for some pizza.

126
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,510
Why so generous today?

127
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:09,220
What's the occasion?

128
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:13,100
Papa, you have a small
pocket and a small heart!

129
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,220
So says the miser.

130
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,090
As if you're super generous.

131
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:18,340
I've been feeding you two
since the past 30 years...

132
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,550
... and what have you spent on this family
from the time you've started earning?

133
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:25,180
Papa, let me buy my house.

134
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:29,510
Then my salary will be at
your disposal and you'll be rich!

135
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,090
Buying property is no joke!

136
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:35,640
What do you know about the area?
Whether it has any appreciation?

137
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,510
You have to understand all these
factors. Do you even know any of this?

138
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,050
What makes you think they'll
approve your loan?

139
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:43,300
Papa, you always underestimate me.

140
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:46,550
To make the impossible possible,
that's what Praful Patel does!

141
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:48,970
Stop nagging her...

142
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,510
Let her invest.

143
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:53,050
You're always sitting
behind the counter of a shop.

144
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:56,050
She's just come home, tired, after
sweeping and mopping floors all day.

145
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:57,840
Let her eat in peace.
- Mummy, it's not sweeping and mopping.

146
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,430
I work in the hotel industry.

147
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:00,670
What did I teach you?
- Yeah.

148
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,130
Housekeeping department.
- Yeah, yeah.

149
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,980
Show some respect. - I spend
my day sitting behind a counter.

150
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,430
And you? In front of the computer...

151
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,430
Shopping online all day long.

152
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:10,840
It's not like I'm buying
gold or diamonds...

153
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:12,720
I buy groceries for the house.

154
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,720
That too because my knees trouble me.

155
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:16,680
Do you have the money
for a visit to the doctor?

156
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,010
Is it an emergency?

157
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:21,010
She is your daughter. Talk to her...

158
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,720
I am saying this for her own good.

159
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:26,800
If she has saved some money then
she should invest it in my business.

160
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,430
Business?
Your Gujarati snacks business?

161
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,050
Papa, it is below my intelligence.

162
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:36,010
As if you have conquered
Everest with your intelligence.

163
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:40,130
I've been working like a servant
so you could have a better future.

164
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,590
I called you here to get an education.

165
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:43,680
But you decided to fall
in love as soon as you got here.

166
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:46,090
You got married despite
our disapproval.

167
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:47,880
And she couldn't even handle that.

168
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,180
She got divorced even
though we told her not to.

169
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,680
And she talks about intelligence.

170
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:55,510
Praful, people get out and
achieve the impossible here.

171
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,220
... and look at you,
you're still a burden to me.

172
00:09:58,410 --> 00:09:59,880
It would've been better if
I hadn't asked you two to come here.

173
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:01,300
We were better off in Ahmedabad.

174
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:04,220
I'm buying my own house so that
I'm no longer a burden to you.

175
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,590
Really?
- So what is the problem now?

176
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,800
Huh?
- Why don't you get married, dear?

177
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:09,840
You will get your own house too!

178
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:13,130
In a few years, these proposals
you are getting now will also stop.

179
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:15,430
And why do you want your own house?

180
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,880
To call your boyfriends over?

181
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:18,680
Yes, I'll call my boyfriends.

182
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,930
What? You'll call
your boyfriends over?

183
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:22,510
No. It's better you don't buy
your own house.

184
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:25,050
She's a girl that too a divorcee.

185
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,090
And she talks about bringing
her boyfriends over.

186
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,760
She wants to ruin my image in society.
- What society are you talking about?

187
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,590
You are on the grassroots level
of the society you are talking about.

188
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,310
You can see everyone up there,
but no one wants to look down, at you.

189
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:39,010
Nobody cares. So just chill.

190
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:41,970
Did you hear that?
How highly our daughter thinks of me?

191
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,380
The things she says
about her own father!

192
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:45,630
Exactly why she couldn't
achieve anything so far.

193
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,430
Mistakes, mistakes and more mistakes!

194
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:49,010
Kumud, let me give it
to you in writing.

195
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:50,510
She is once again
going to make a mistake!

196
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:52,130
Yes, I'll make mistakes!

197
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:55,090
I make mistakes!
But I also agree to making them.

198
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:58,220
I don't lie to myself like you two.
Look at yourselves.

199
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:01,610
If this is how married couples behave,
then it's better to be a divorcee.

200
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:03,430
Get out of my house then!

201
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,630
If we are so bad then
why do you stay with us?

202
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,630
Get out of my house!

203
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,340
Don't yell! It will do you more harm.

204
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:09,880
All because of you!
- You'll get a heart attack.

205
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:10,550
We have just one daughter!

206
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:11,970
Just eat the pizza.
- And you couldn't even take care of her.

207
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:12,720
What have I...

208
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,470
You two have made
my life a living hell.

209
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:16,470
I'd rather be dead.
- Will you stop it and just eat?

210
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:17,590
This is all because of you.

211
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,630
Because of me?

212
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,130
Go! You too go with her.

213
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,090
Yes, I would, but I cannot walk!

214
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:26,620
You don't have the money for the doctor!
- I should have left you both in Ahmedabad...

215
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:27,930
Hello, Amber?

216
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,300
Let's go to Vegas.

217
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:00,510
This is... This is like so big...

218
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,230
Quite big for one person.

219
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,300
Don't look back.

220
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:08,880
Why?
- Your idiot ex is here.

221
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:11,840
Come on, let's leave.

222
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,140
Hey!
- Hi!

223
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,420
How you doing?

224
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,050
So good to see you.
- Good to see you too.

225
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,550
Hi.

226
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:24,260
Hello.

227
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:26,550
You're Amber's cousin?

228
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:29,340
The one who works in the hotel.
- Yeah, Praf.

229
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:33,460
I met you at your engagement,
which you both broke.

230
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,470
You both carry on.

231
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,180
I'll see you in the hotel.

232
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:55,000
Praf...

233
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,760
No one at home should
find out about this.

234
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,130
I can trust you, right?

235
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,310
That's why I am here...

236
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:02,130
That's why you brought
me along and no one else.

237
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,630
You can trust me.

238
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,380
Are you seriously upset?

239
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,090
It's not a big deal.

240
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:10,760
You could have told me.
But anyway, don't worry.

241
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,300
Just don't elope with him.

242
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:14,510
Otherwise, your family will kill me.

243
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,280
I'm getting married soon.

244
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:19,050
I'm only here to say goodbye.

245
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,090
Say your goodbye and
I'll see you in the hotel.

246
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,180
But where will you go?

247
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,970
I'll find something sinful
to do in this sin city.

248
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,300
Put money.

249
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:46,300
Put money.
- I don't have money.

250
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,700
No, no. Put money.
Yes, it's my job.

251
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:35,520
Hello.
- Hey! How are you?

252
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:38,680
This is nice.
- Yes.

253
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,470
How much is this for?
- That's 10 dollars.

254
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:42,260
10 dollars? Can you give me in five?

255
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,800
No, I cannot sell it for less than 10.

256
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,010
How much is this for?
- 20 dollars.

257
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:47,130
If you give me two then
in 10 I can buy this. - Thank you.

258
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:50,380
No, it's 10 dollars.
- But this is not for 10 dollars.

259
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,930
Take it. It's my gift to you.

260
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:54,590
Take it? - Yes, take it.
My gift to you. Okay?

261
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,470
Thank you.
- Yeah.

262
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:58,750
That clip, how much?
I can pay for this.

263
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:00,820
Take it, my gift. Take it.

264
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,050
Thank you.

265
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:20,340
Well, hello.

266
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:22,570
Hello.
- How's it going?

267
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:25,380
Good.
- Alright, what can I get you, babe?

268
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:29,760
I want some pink
champagne and some caviar.

269
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,340
Yeah.
- But I cannot afford it.

270
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,760
So give me some beer.

271
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:37,720
And some french-fries
complimentary from your side.

272
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,430
Ah, well we don't
have free french-fries.

273
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,180
Chips?

274
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:43,510
No chips either.

275
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,720
Peanuts?
- We have some peanuts.

276
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:47,630
Get some then.
- Alright, alright.

277
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,590
Calm down.

278
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:52,470
Hey!

279
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,780
How you doing?

280
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:54,550
Yeah

281
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:57,840
You like that?

282
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,430
He's hot.

283
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:02,180
Yeah, he was here last night.

284
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,340
I think he is here for the weekend.

285
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:04,930
But he's by himself.

286
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:07,010
You think I should try my luck?

287
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:09,600
Of course, look at where you are.
You're in Vegas.

288
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:12,380
I am in Vegas.
- Go for it. Get him.

289
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,870
Hello.
I'm Prafu...

290
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,420
I'm Praf from Atlanta.

291
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,600
Are you tired?

292
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,220
Because you are running in my mind.

293
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,300
I saw it.

294
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,990
But I mean it was kinda cheesy.

295
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:01,470
You can do better.

296
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:03,600
I can do better but
I need another chance.

297
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:04,440
He left.

298
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,760
No, he's probably playing Baccarat.
He loves that game over there.

299
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:08,800
What is Baccarat?

300
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,430
Oh, you've never
seen the James Bond movies?

301
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:25,840
Hello.

302
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:27,430
Hi.

303
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,050
Hi.

304
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:31,970
There you go.
- Pleasure.

305
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,130
Do you want to play?

306
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:37,300
This is a five-dollar chip.

307
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:38,380
He will deal the cards.

308
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,220
One to the bank and one to the player.

309
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,010
You have to place
a bet on one of them.

310
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:44,720
And the number which is
closest to the number nine wins.

311
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,050
Baccarat is all about number nine.

312
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:48,680
Do you want to play?

313
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,510
Why not?
- Go ahead.

314
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:53,220
Give me ten dollar chips.

315
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,630
Minimum is 25, ma'am.

316
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:56,510
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

317
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,590
Take this.
- Oh.

318
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,720
Thank you, buddy.

319
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,220
No problem.
Dave Mehta, New Jersey.

320
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,880
Praful Patel from Atlanta.

321
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,590
Gujarati?

322
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,720
You too?
- Yup.

323
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:07,760
Shall we?

324
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:08,930
Let's play.

325
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,590
All set?

326
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,180
Cards are out.

327
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,470
Player wins the set.

328
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,300
We won.

329
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:26,220
This is yours.

330
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,970
This is 50.
- 50.

331
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:28,930
All yours.

332
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,780
The bank wins.

333
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,380
There you go! We win again!

334
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:41,340
We won! Again!

335
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:43,760
And this is all yours.

336
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,380
Tie.

337
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,640
It's a Tie.
- Oh my God!

338
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,720
There you go!

339
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:55,950
Player wins.

340
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,380
Player wins.
- Oh man!

341
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:15,480
Player wins.

342
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:21,260
Hello?
Amber, I won 2000 dollars!

343
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,830
Huh?
Oh, my God!

344
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:25,050
Are you okay?

345
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,350
Okay, coming, coming.

346
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:27,300
I'm coming.

347
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:29,180
No, I am coming.

348
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:32,550
Thank you very much.

349
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:36,370
Amber!

350
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:38,870
Get it out.

351
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,410
Get it all out.

352
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:41,960
Just let it all come out.

353
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:04,660
Nikhil is bad, Praf.

354
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:07,910
You shouldn't have met him.

355
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,450
I think I'm still in love with him.

356
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:16,790
Then why don't you marry him?

357
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,450
Because he doesn't
want to get married.

358
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:23,370
Then don't marry anyone.

359
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,290
That is not how it happens, Praf.

360
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,760
You cannot spend your life alone.

361
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:35,660
I'm doing just fine.

362
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:40,700
Not you.
You're so different and independent.

363
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,830
I'm a 30-year-old divorcee.

364
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44,540
You are a 25-year-old young girl.

365
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,950
I'm a housekeeper.
You're a jewelry designer.

366
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,200
How can I be more
independent than you?

367
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:51,120
I don't know, Praf.

368
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,830
Don't ask me these questions.

369
00:20:56,540 --> 00:21:00,580
By the way, you're going
to meet Hitesh at my wedding.

370
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:03,950
If he's going to
attend it then I am not.

371
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:07,660
Don't be so serious. He's
not coming.

372
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,450
Why don't you come with Mike?

373
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,540
Mike is last season.

374
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,490
You left him as well?

375
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:17,240
There was a small girl.

376
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:20,450
She asked her mother,
"Mother, what is a boyfriend?"

377
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:24,070
Her mother said "If you become
a good girl you will get one."

378
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:27,450
Then the small girl said,
"Mother, if I become a bad girl?"

379
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:29,910
The mother said "Then
you will get many."

380
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:33,580
What!

381
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,990
God, You're so weird!

382
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,070
Heavenly angels

383
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:49,970
Brought heaven closer

384
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:53,850
What I see on the ground...

385
00:21:54,560 --> 00:22:02,600
Is it a guiding light or a refuge...

386
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:07,270
Shadows of heaven...

387
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:11,890
Have bestowed heaven upon me...

388
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:16,640
Dear life...

389
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:19,710
Fate has changed...

390
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:23,800
Now break the bond and live a little...

391
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:24,830
How are you?

392
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:26,700
I am okay.
- I have got something for you.

393
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,080
What's this?

394
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:28,970
Please keep it.

395
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:29,860
Thank you.

396
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:36,600
Break the prison and fly away...

397
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:42,900
Spread your wings and fly away...

398
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:49,000
Break the prison and fly away...

399
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:54,040
Spread your wings and fly away...

400
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,080
Wow!

401
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:57,660
My gosh, you look amazing.

402
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,080
That dress!

403
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:00,490
400 dollars.

404
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:01,700
And your lipstick!

405
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,080
50 dollars.

406
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:05,410
Now get me some pink champagne.

407
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:07,080
You mean beer and peanuts?

408
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,290
No, I mean pink champagne.

409
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:12,160
Yeah!

410
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:15,540
Hello!
- Hello! Welcome to the game.

411
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:23,120
Give me... chips for... for 200.

412
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:24,450
Okay.

413
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,950
It looks like we've got
some unfinished business.

414
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:37,990
I hope you don't lose
all that money today.

415
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,040
Place your bets.

416
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:43,910
Player.

417
00:23:59,160 --> 00:23:59,990
Bank.

418
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:02,410
Player.

419
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:18,040
Excuse me.

420
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:25,240
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

421
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:31,580
Hi.
- Hi.

422
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:34,450
I'm Adam from California.

423
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:35,580
Hi, Adam.

424
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:37,700
You look beautiful.

425
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,290
Thank you.

426
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:42,200
Why did you leave after
losing just two games?

427
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:44,950
Because I don't have
more money to play now.

428
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:48,830
You know, you can win a
lot of money by playing baccarat.

429
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:50,160
In just a few minutes.

430
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:52,830
You just have to
play five to six rounds.

431
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:54,330
Why five to six rounds?

432
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:56,620
I've read that
when you play five to six rounds...

433
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:00,080
...your chances of winning are higher,
like last night.

434
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:01,910
Ya, I won.

435
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,450
Let me get that.

436
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:07,830
I cannot take your tip for free.

437
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:09,450
Fine.

438
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,620
I'll make you work for it.

439
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,120
Where is the protection?

440
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,490
I don't have it.

441
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,240
You don't have protection?

442
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:37,290
No.

443
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,740
Wait... No, it's fine.

444
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,330
Zip my dress up!

445
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:59,620
You are a cute guy,
but not a decent guy.

446
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:16,450
No protection no sex, my friend.

447
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,430
Hey Dave!

448
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:07,780
Praf! How are you?

449
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,200
How you doing?
- Great!

450
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:12,160
What's this?
- I won this at the table today!

451
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:13,910
Yes.
- Where you played?

452
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:15,660
I am playing at the big table.

453
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,830
I am going to cash
this and enjoy myself.

454
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:21,200
Bye, see you!
- Bye, you look beautiful Praf!

455
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,160
Praful! What the hell are you doing?
We are going to miss our flight.

456
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,080
Sorry, sorry!
I need to play one more round.

457
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,190
I can't miss this flight.

458
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,680
You stay and gamble if you want to.
I'm going.

459
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:13,040
Just one round!
- You haven't even packed yet!

460
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:15,160
Amber, just one round.
Amber!

461
00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:17,160
Packing will take two minutes!

462
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:17,910
Wait! Amber!

463
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:19,370
Amber, wait!

464
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,660
So you're trying to say that...

465
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:23,790
... you lost all the money you won...

466
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:27,080
... and you also lost 8000 out of the
money you had saved for your house?

467
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:29,490
I just needed one more round!

468
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:31,290
What do you mean you
needed one more round, Praf?

469
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:32,790
Gambling is like that only.

470
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:34,490
If you don't lose how will you win?

471
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,490
You need to lose some to win some.

472
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:39,040
Praf! Get a hold of yourself, man!

473
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,910
This is how people
get into big trouble.

474
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:43,040
8000 dollars is a lot of money!

475
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,540
Hello.

476
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:56,040
Where have you been?

477
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:09,330
Look dear, we cannot live our
lives like Amber and her parents.

478
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:12,620
They can afford it.
They're rich. We aren't.

479
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:16,450
Mohan, let her at
least take a breather.

480
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:20,120
Praful, have you eaten
or shall I get you something?

481
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,080
No, she must be tired from
all the sightseeing in Vegas.

482
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:24,700
Sure. Please, go ahead.
Feed her all you want.

483
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,080
She has all the money to have fun.

484
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:28,660
Where do you get the money from?

485
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:32,740
Praful!

486
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,370
The electricity bill is due.

487
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:38,700
It's kept on the table. Pay it.

488
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:15,280
Hello, Mr. Steven.
- Ms. Patel.

489
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:18,040
We were supposed to meet
today to discuss paperwork?

490
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:24,620
Are you okay?

491
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,790
Mr. Steven.
I've fallen sick. Very badly.

492
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:31,160
Have you been to the doctor?

493
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,450
I need one more week you see.

494
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:36,090
I... I have multiple health problems.

495
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:38,450
I'll try the best I can.

496
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:42,160
I have, I have the money it's
just that my health is not okay.

497
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:46,080
Okay, well please just
take care of yourself. Okay?

498
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:48,490
I'll talk to you later.

499
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:55,620
Hey Cynthia,
you've got a customer, Ms...?

500
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,410
Patel! - Ms. Patel.

501
00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:00,330
She said she just wants two minutes.

502
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:02,950
Just two... just... yeah.

503
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:05,450
Alright.

504
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:07,080
Okay, I'll let her in.

505
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,360
Okay.
- Thank you.

506
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:16,040
Hello ma'am, I just want to
know when is my loan getting approved?

507
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,830
Give me a moment, please.

508
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:23,700
I tried to call many times
but I did not get any appointment.

509
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:25,040
No response.

510
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,660
Ms. Patel...

511
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:30,740
I have been through your account
and as much as I'd like to help...

512
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,120
You're not eligible for a loan.

513
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:36,200
Why?

514
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,040
Your credit rating is very low.

515
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:41,120
It seems you've emptied
your account in one day.

516
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:43,450
That was for something urgent.

517
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:46,330
But I have the pre approval.
You only told me.

518
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:48,700
Your credit rating is very low.

519
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:52,580
But if I had funds
why would I need a loan?

520
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:56,240
I'm sorry but that's how banks work,
Ms. Patel.

521
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:58,200
Our borrowers borrow money.

522
00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:02,410
People who can't repay try to steal,
not borrow.

523
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:05,290
Are you trying to
say I am trying to steal?

524
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:06,660
No, of course not.

525
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,950
But if you really want this loan.

526
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,490
I suggest you work to improve
your funds over the next few months.

527
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:14,330
But I have...
- You have a good day.

528
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,450
I'll see you later.

529
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:18,490
Thank you.

530
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:37,790
Papa!

531
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:39,700
Why all of a sudden?
Are you feeling alright?

532
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:43,040
I'm being affectionate.
Can't I?

533
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:44,240
What's this?

534
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:46,830
Tomato and pepper curry.

535
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:58,580
Papa, my friend Salma's father
passed away from a heart attack.

536
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:03,620
That made me think that I
shouldn't trouble my parents so much.

537
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:05,410
It happens. It happens.

538
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:07,660
You shouldn't let it bother
you so much. It happens.

539
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:13,240
Papa, will you come with
me to see my flat tomorrow?

540
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:15,450
Why me, all of a sudden?

541
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:16,990
Not all of a sudden.

542
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:22,040
I've decided that I won't
do anything without your permission.

543
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:25,040
Sorry, I was about go buy a house...

544
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,790
... for myself without informing
you or taking your advice.

545
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:33,410
But papa, I want to invest
in this property only with you.

546
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:35,540
We will buy a joint property.

547
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,080
Really?

548
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:39,790
Joint property?

549
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:43,620
I don't think you know
anything about investment.

550
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:46,660
If you need help then
why don't you say so.

551
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:53,290
Okay. Well, why hide
anything from you, papa...

552
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:55,540
Help me a little?

553
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:59,950
I can help you,
but I have a condition.

554
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:01,450
Tell me.

555
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:03,540
We have got a very
good marriage proposal.

556
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:06,740
He's the son of the owner
of Parekh Hosiery in Rajkot.

557
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,240
He's very handsome.

558
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:09,740
And he is single.

559
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,200
If you meet him...

560
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:35,910
Welcome back!
- Thank you!

561
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:38,580
So is it a beer or
champagne kinda day?

562
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:41,740
No drinking.
I have to win my money back.

563
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,080
You... you mean you have
to win back the money you lost.

564
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,740
I lost some of my savings.

565
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:47,200
I am in trouble.

566
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,740
Look, I am not supposed to say this...

567
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:53,740
... but if I were you,
I wouldn't go back and play.

568
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:17,870
Any more bets?

569
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:23,330
Okay, no more bets?

570
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:27,620
Player shows six.
Banker banks on nine.

571
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:28,990
Banker wins.

572
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:35,930
Excuse me!

573
00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:52,450
What you want, huh?

574
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,120
Here's a watch.

575
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,080
It's worth 15,000 at least.

576
00:35:57,970 --> 00:35:59,240
What about the car outside?

577
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:01,120
I'll give you the pink slip, alright?

578
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,790
65,000 any day.

579
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:08,450
Mike, you owe me 85,000 dollars.

580
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:11,290
I couldn't get 10 for this.

581
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:14,240
And your car... is a piece of junk.

582
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,540
Place you bets please.

583
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:19,290
Ma'am, are you okay?

584
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:21,040
You guys have taken it all away.

585
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:24,040
You have stolen everything.
This is cheating!

586
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:25,490
Ma'am, please calm down.

587
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:27,240
I want to talk to the owner.

588
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:28,490
Ma'am, please calm down.

589
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:31,240
You guys have stolen
my seven years' worth savings.

590
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:35,410
Calm down or we'll
have to call security.

591
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:39,330
Call your owner.

592
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:42,870
I... I will not go anywhere.
I will be here today!

593
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:44,330
Calm down, calm down.

594
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:45,490
Are you the owner?

595
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,450
Come on. Come here.

596
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,950
I want to talk to you.
- We can talk. Come here.

597
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:52,040
Come here. We can talk. We can talk.

598
00:36:57,370 --> 00:37:01,080
Give me my money back. You
are cheaters, all of you are cheaters!

599
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,700
You are all thieves!

600
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:04,950
I'm not the owner. I'm not the owner.

601
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,580
I'm a private moneylender.

602
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:09,490
You wanna win all your money back,
don't you?

603
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:11,450
I lost all my savings.

604
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:13,040
It's all good, baby.

605
00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:14,870
So how much you need?

606
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:17,870
You are very sweet.
You want to give me money.

607
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:19,160
You're a nice man.

608
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:20,870
It's all good. It's all good.

609
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:22,330
So how much do you need?

610
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,490
25,000?

611
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:29,160
No.

612
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:31,660
32,000.
- That's it.

613
00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:34,330
I want to show him a lesson!

614
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,450
Hey...
- You cheaters...

615
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:39,490
I'm going to need your
social security card.

616
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:41,410
Why?
- Your drivers' license.

617
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:43,700
Why?

618
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:47,950
I just gave you 32,000 dollars,
baby girl!

619
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:55,830
Thank you, buddy.
You're a good person, huh?

620
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:58,490
Thank you very much.
- Now go show him a lesson.

621
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:08,230
Place your bets please.

622
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,120
Place your bets please.

623
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,270
Banker.

624
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:19,370
Banker.

625
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,490
Hi ma'am,
would you like to buy some more?

626
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:24,620
Place your bets please.

627
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:11,510
How many 'Ghaatiyas'
(Gujarati snacks)?

628
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:12,630
Six.

629
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:13,470
Six.

630
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:15,220
Four of 'Sev'(Gujarati snacks),
right?

631
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,760
Five.
- 'Sev'.

632
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:19,180
Five.

633
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:21,340
'Bhakarwadi'(Gujarati snacks).
One, two, three, four, five, six...

634
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:22,510
Mohan's new import.

635
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,430
He has imported snacks from Rajkot.
- Four...

636
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:27,010
Here, taste it.

637
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:29,300
Chutney...

638
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,430
Four...

639
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:39,410
Papa, you were saying
something the other day...

640
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:44,120
That if I agree to
meet the boy then...

641
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:46,120
You were saying something like that.

642
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,870
Praful, you...

643
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:50,200
Now when she is saying
that she'll meet the boy...

644
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:52,030
... then why are you questioning her?

645
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:55,490
I suggest you invite
them over tomorrow itself.

646
00:39:56,870 --> 00:39:57,700
Done.

647
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:58,870
We'll call them over.

648
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:06,620
Praful, that's Mr. and Mrs. Parekh.

649
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,280
You remember Kaushal?

650
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:11,570
He has a hosiery shop in Rajkot.
He is his cousin.

651
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:12,990
How are you, auntie?

652
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,320
How are you, uncle?

653
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:15,700
All good, dear.

654
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:17,820
He's Kaushal's elder son.

655
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:18,700
Sameer.
- Hello.

656
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:19,470
Hello.

657
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,740
You work in a hotel?

658
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:24,450
Housekeeping department.

659
00:40:24,570 --> 00:40:25,410
Very good.

660
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:27,320
She will keep the house clean.

661
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:31,490
Anyway, a housewife
is a housekeeper, right?

662
00:40:32,370 --> 00:40:34,660
Dear, you have been working
in the same hotel for seven years?

663
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:35,370
Yes.

664
00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:37,870
After the divorce, right?

665
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:43,160
Sameer, you have come here for MBA?

666
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,160
Yes, auntie.

667
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:47,950
Your aunt told me that
you have a new startup plan.

668
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:51,490
Yes, actually I plan
to make a mobile app.

669
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:52,530
Wonderful.

670
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:54,870
Nowadays everyone uses apps.

671
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:59,320
My wife is an online champion.
She does everything online.

672
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:03,240
Prayers happening in Atlanta
but pundit sitting in Nathdwara.

673
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:08,030
Actually,
my app too is related to our culture.

674
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:11,030
You can view all religious
places in India through that.

675
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,990
You can watch its live telecast.

676
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,320
Press a button and offer flowers.

677
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,700
Press another button
and feed the poor.

678
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:18,870
Instant karma.

679
00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:20,370
Hail Lord Shiva.

680
00:41:20,490 --> 00:41:21,490
Wonderful.

681
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:28,320
I think the kids should
talk to each other.

682
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,570
Yes, sure.

683
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,410
Why do you want to get married?

684
00:41:56,650 --> 00:41:57,780
For a green card?

685
00:41:58,620 --> 00:41:59,530
No.

686
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:02,450
I mean I am doing my MBA here.

687
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:04,990
I can easily spend two years
here without getting married.

688
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:08,910
I want to get married
because I am alone.

689
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:13,280
Life will get better
if I find a life partner.

690
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,890
Anyway, if two people earn
then the expenses get divided.

691
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:21,780
So your wife will earn
and you will educate yourself?

692
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,370
No.

693
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:25,240
I have worked for two years.

694
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:27,120
I have money for my education.

695
00:42:29,970 --> 00:42:32,120
I wanted to be a self-made man.

696
00:42:33,330 --> 00:42:34,820
And I have a plan for that too.

697
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:36,660
I just need a purpose.

698
00:42:37,370 --> 00:42:38,410
I am searching for it.

699
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:44,240
You think you will get purpose,
love, companionship...

700
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:48,070
... all nicely wrapped
in a package called marriage?

701
00:42:48,930 --> 00:42:49,910
I don't know.

702
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:53,530
I will try to be true to
this relationship to the best I can.

703
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:56,200
Then we will see where life takes us.

704
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:59,740
I too gave my best to a relationship.

705
00:43:00,090 --> 00:43:01,660
Look at what happened to me.

706
00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:04,570
What if life brings
you to a similar juncture?

707
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:07,450
What if you are standing
where I am standing today?

708
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:09,240
So what's wrong?

709
00:43:09,950 --> 00:43:11,450
The weather is wonderful.

710
00:43:11,950 --> 00:43:13,120
It's not raining either.

711
00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:17,320
And I don't think
my company is that bad either.

712
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:18,780
Right?

713
00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:24,700
You tend to romanticize things.

714
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,870
You too are quite frank.

715
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:29,510
It was a pleasure to meet you.

716
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,280
Shall we go back?

717
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:36,820
Let's go...

718
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:43,120
Praful.

719
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:45,530
She's asleep.

720
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:46,780
No.

721
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:53,370
Praful, I liked this boy.

722
00:43:55,500 --> 00:44:00,070
Mummy, papa told me that
he would help me if I meet the boy.

723
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:01,530
What do you mean?

724
00:44:02,130 --> 00:44:06,120
He told me that he would
help me if I meet the boy.

725
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:09,120
Really? When did that happen?

726
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:10,490
Mummy...

727
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,780
Tell me, how did you like Sameer?

728
00:44:15,130 --> 00:44:18,400
I'll never get such a house
again in minority housing.

729
00:44:21,630 --> 00:44:22,620
Okay, dear.

730
00:44:22,870 --> 00:44:24,070
Don't worry.

731
00:44:24,810 --> 00:44:28,910
I'll talk to your father
when he's in a good mood.

732
00:44:30,870 --> 00:44:33,620
But at least tell me
what you though of Sameer...

733
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:35,450
Good night.

734
00:44:36,370 --> 00:44:37,320
Good night.

735
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:48,200
Hello, Mr. Steven.

736
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:49,820
Yes, Ms. Patel.

737
00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:54,160
I need some more time.

738
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:57,280
I'm... I'm sorry Ms. Patel,
but that house is sold.

739
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:01,320
That house is sold?

740
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:02,990
Yes.

741
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:05,620
But you said you will wait for me.

742
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:08,450
I know, but it has been a while
since you called back, Ms. Patel.

743
00:45:08,910 --> 00:45:11,120
I am sorry I just
couldn't wait anymore.

744
00:45:34,330 --> 00:45:35,070
Granny!

745
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:38,280
Oh my baby! Come here. Come here.

746
00:45:39,710 --> 00:45:40,490
How are you?

747
00:45:40,630 --> 00:45:42,120
I am fine.

748
00:45:42,370 --> 00:45:47,490
But you neither call,
whatsapp or snapchat.

749
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:51,120
Don't you miss Nathdwara?
- I do.

750
00:45:51,530 --> 00:45:53,320
Then why this half smile?

751
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:54,950
It's a full smile.

752
00:45:55,870 --> 00:45:57,910
But it doesn't reach your eyes.

753
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:04,740
I had found a nice
house in minority housing.

754
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,820
But I lost that deal.

755
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:09,070
It's okay, you'll find another one.

756
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:13,660
Oh, my God. Him?
What is he doing here?

757
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:14,450
Who?

758
00:46:14,570 --> 00:46:18,280
The boy who had come to see me.
- Which one?

759
00:46:18,370 --> 00:46:22,240
That one. The stupid looking one...
oh shit, he saw me.

760
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:25,490
Hi, Praful.
- Hello.

761
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,280
My granny.

762
00:46:27,370 --> 00:46:29,700
I seek your blessings.
- It's okay. God bless you.

763
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:33,370
Why do I feel as if
she was badmouthing me?

764
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:35,200
It's not that...

765
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:38,950
She was saying that sweet
boy had come to see her.

766
00:46:39,370 --> 00:46:40,820
Did she say that?
- Yes.

767
00:46:42,570 --> 00:46:44,070
Does she like this sweet boy?

768
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:47,030
She likes you.

769
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:49,320
It's not so.

770
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:53,160
I still haven't thought about that.

771
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:54,740
After all she's a girl.

772
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:57,530
This...

773
00:46:57,870 --> 00:47:00,700
I knew I'd find Praful
here so I brought this along.

774
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:02,160
What's this?

775
00:47:02,410 --> 00:47:03,570
Have a look.

776
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:10,040
This belongs to my grandma.

777
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:13,200
I wanted to give it to
the one I'd spend my life with.

778
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:16,860
You still carry your grandma's
last memento in your pocket?

779
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:18,820
It's not so.

780
00:47:19,090 --> 00:47:21,950
You tend to have your heart broken a
few times by the time you reach this age.

781
00:47:22,410 --> 00:47:23,620
This is its third copy.

782
00:47:25,990 --> 00:47:30,570
Third copy or the fourth copy,
it should be its last copy.

783
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:31,870
You are absolutely right.

784
00:47:32,450 --> 00:47:33,200
Keep it, dear.

785
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:34,490
Granny!
- Take it.

786
00:47:34,570 --> 00:47:36,370
Let's go.
The function is about to begin.

787
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:38,370
Come on, lets go.

788
00:47:49,410 --> 00:47:51,200
The function is about to begin.

789
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:58,300
"Madam's Indian,
but follows western fashion."

790
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:01,810
"Her words are often coated
in honey and then some."

791
00:48:01,890 --> 00:48:05,260
"She moves in style,
she's full of pride."

792
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:08,010
"Her conversations are hi-fi!"

793
00:48:08,850 --> 00:48:12,280
"Her attitude towards
her beloved's different."

794
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:14,850
"She swirls in such a way
that she cannot be stopped."

795
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:18,620
"When baby dances all dressed
up she looks breathtaking."

796
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:22,210
"When baby dances all dressed
up she looks breathtaking."

797
00:48:22,290 --> 00:48:25,670
"When baby dances all dressed
up she looks breathtaking."

798
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:29,240
"When baby dances all dressed
up she looks breathtaking."

799
00:48:43,510 --> 00:48:46,950
"My boy's handsome
and you girl's beautiful."

800
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:50,440
"Everyone feels that
this match is made in heaven."

801
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:54,030
"My boy's handsome
and you girl's beautiful."

802
00:48:54,110 --> 00:48:57,880
"Everyone feels that
this match is made in heaven."

803
00:49:04,970 --> 00:49:08,420
"Live a happy and a blessed life."

804
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:11,960
"Keep glowing like a LED light."

805
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:18,890
"Live a happy and a blessed life."

806
00:49:18,970 --> 00:49:22,350
"Keep glowing like a LED light."

807
00:49:22,430 --> 00:49:25,890
"Everyone's blessing
you with a good fate."

808
00:49:25,970 --> 00:49:28,950
"May this couple always
remain smiling and sate."

809
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:32,910
"Keep your family's photo close."

810
00:49:32,990 --> 00:49:35,700
"We don't want you
to forget us almost."

811
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:39,100
"When baby dances all dressed
up she looks breathtaking."

812
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:42,730
"When baby dances all dressed
up she looks breathtaking."

813
00:49:42,810 --> 00:49:46,190
"When baby dances all dressed
up she looks breathtaking."

814
00:49:46,270 --> 00:49:49,920
"When baby dances all dressed
up she looks breathtaking."

815
00:50:03,770 --> 00:50:06,600
"When baby dances all dressed up..."

816
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:10,100
"When baby dances all dressed up..."

817
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:14,330
"When baby dances all dressed
up she looks breathtaking."

818
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:29,870
Well, don't you look good?

819
00:50:30,410 --> 00:50:33,870
Indian princess, huh?

820
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:36,120
So, was this your wedding?

821
00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:40,280
No, it is my... it
is my cousin's wedding.

822
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:43,370
We apologize for disturbing you here.

823
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:45,950
We stopped by your house first.

824
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:47,850
But you weren't there.

825
00:50:53,190 --> 00:50:55,740
We cannot have this conversation here.

826
00:50:56,320 --> 00:51:00,280
I have your number.
I will call you. You please go.

827
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:03,820
I'm not going anywhere
without my money.

828
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:09,450
You ran off with 32,000 dollars,
it's been fifteen days.

829
00:51:10,430 --> 00:51:12,320
With interest that's 40,000

830
00:51:13,130 --> 00:51:16,450
So we might as well
round it up to... to 50,000.

831
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,740
Look, I lost all that
money you know that.

832
00:51:28,990 --> 00:51:32,030
I don't have any
money right now but...

833
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:35,780
But you're asking me for 50,000.

834
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:37,530
Why should I give you 50,000?

835
00:51:37,790 --> 00:51:39,370
You came and gave me that money!

836
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:41,120
I did not ask you for that money!

837
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:44,180
And now you are coming
to my relative's house...

838
00:52:06,230 --> 00:52:07,370
I'm sorry.

839
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:11,660
I should've not
run with your money.

840
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:15,660
But I don't have any money right now.

841
00:52:21,950 --> 00:52:25,780
I'm not asking, I'm telling you.

842
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:33,160
50,000, in 10 days.

843
00:52:52,570 --> 00:52:54,780
Today's function went off well.

844
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:56,950
So many people attended it.
- It's just showoff.

845
00:52:57,030 --> 00:52:59,030
They love to flaunt it to the society.
- They spent a lot.

846
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:01,490
They sent tickets and invited
so many people from India.

847
00:53:01,630 --> 00:53:02,950
It was fun.

848
00:53:05,490 --> 00:53:07,320
Did Praful tell you she
isn't buying the house?

849
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:15,570
No, she asked me to
talk to you for the money.

850
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:17,120
Why?

851
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:19,280
The other day she said
that she had the money.

852
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:22,740
Now why does she need the money
when she isn't buying the house?

853
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:27,240
I don't understand
what this girl is up to.

854
00:53:44,370 --> 00:53:45,450
Papa...

855
00:53:46,370 --> 00:53:48,320
I want to discuss something with you.

856
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:50,030
Tell me.

857
00:53:55,670 --> 00:53:57,660
I need some money.

858
00:53:58,460 --> 00:53:59,740
I'll return it.

859
00:54:00,030 --> 00:54:02,120
But right now,
I need your help.

860
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:04,620
Why do you need the money?

861
00:54:06,950 --> 00:54:11,120
I told you, I want to buy a house.
- Don't lie, Praful!

862
00:54:12,570 --> 00:54:13,820
You are lying!

863
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:19,070
Your granny told me that
you aren't even buying a house.

864
00:54:20,070 --> 00:54:21,620
Then why are you pretending
to buy the house?

865
00:54:22,570 --> 00:54:24,320
To extract money from me?
Yes?

866
00:54:29,370 --> 00:54:30,660
Where are you going?

867
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:33,700
Answer me!
Tell me!

868
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:37,370
She keeps on lying
that too to her father.

869
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:40,620
I wonder why God gave me such a child.

870
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:45,280
What is this?

871
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:47,990
The electricity bill is still here?

872
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:50,240
You don't have the
money to pay the bill!

873
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:51,950
But you have money
to go out and have fun!

874
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:54,490
Makes me angry to call you
my daughter.

875
00:54:58,490 --> 00:55:01,740
Kumud, take the money
for the bill out from her bag.

876
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:02,700
What?

877
00:55:02,950 --> 00:55:04,370
Didn't you hear what I said?

878
00:55:04,450 --> 00:55:05,490
Take the money from her bag!

879
00:55:06,070 --> 00:55:08,490
Do it or I'll throw
you both out of the house.

880
00:55:10,530 --> 00:55:14,700
I am fed up of all
this nagging and bantering.

881
00:55:17,370 --> 00:55:18,240
Here.

882
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:20,780
This is all your doing!

883
00:55:20,990 --> 00:55:22,820
I've had it with you two!

884
00:55:28,270 --> 00:55:29,120
Praful!

885
00:55:29,930 --> 00:55:30,780
Praful!

886
00:55:30,990 --> 00:55:31,990
Is this yours?

887
00:55:32,530 --> 00:55:34,240
What is it doing on the guest's bed?

888
00:55:35,070 --> 00:55:37,070
I don't understand how many times...

889
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:41,030
Praful, what is going on?

890
00:55:43,530 --> 00:55:45,070
Praful, talk to me.

891
00:55:46,410 --> 00:55:48,030
Praful, do want to discuss something?

892
00:55:48,550 --> 00:55:50,370
I have problems. Sorry.

893
00:55:51,450 --> 00:55:52,120
What problems?

894
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:54,160
Just come back to me
and I'll solve them all.

895
00:55:58,370 --> 00:55:59,160
Praful...

896
00:56:00,820 --> 00:56:03,570
So... wow.

897
00:56:07,870 --> 00:56:09,500
I miss you so much, Praful.

898
00:56:11,530 --> 00:56:12,870
Mike...
- I promise...

899
00:56:13,250 --> 00:56:16,570
Mike!
- Praful...

900
00:56:20,530 --> 00:56:22,950
You better concentrate on your work.

901
00:57:14,910 --> 00:57:16,410
Hello.
- Hey, how's it going?

902
00:57:19,830 --> 00:57:20,660
It's declined.

903
00:57:25,410 --> 00:57:27,280
It's declined, lady.
- Wait, it works.

904
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:29,320
It worked a few hours back.
- Well, it's not working now.

905
00:57:29,450 --> 00:57:31,070
Let me try one more time.

906
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:37,910
It's declined.
- I pay cash.

907
00:57:37,990 --> 00:57:38,780
Fine.

908
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:50,620
Hey no! Get that off of there!

909
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:56,240
Come on lady, I don't have all day.

910
00:57:58,620 --> 00:58:00,640
Hurry please.
I had put money in this bag.

911
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:01,870
Then find it please.

912
00:58:05,740 --> 00:58:08,780
Lady! Come on, I don't have all day.
- I have put it in this bag!

913
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:13,990
Lady...

914
00:58:14,370 --> 00:58:15,740
Lady, what are you doing?
Get off the floor!

915
00:58:15,820 --> 00:58:18,030
I've put money in this!
- Listen, it's fine...

916
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:19,740
I put money in this bag!

917
00:58:19,870 --> 00:58:21,660
Jesus... It's fine.
It's just money, calm down.

918
00:58:21,740 --> 00:58:23,620
I put it in this bag
and now it is not here!

919
00:58:23,740 --> 00:58:25,740
Hey, calm down. It's just money, lady.

920
00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:28,200
Hold on, I'll get you some water.

921
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:29,910
Jesus.

922
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:04,530
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

923
00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:05,780
Hey!

924
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:07,510
Shit!

925
01:00:45,490 --> 01:00:48,790
Good afternoon.
What can I do for you today?

926
01:01:03,700 --> 01:01:06,950
Okay, okay.
You got any preference of bills?

927
01:01:19,330 --> 01:01:21,660
She's gotta bomb!
Joyce! Phyllis!

928
01:01:21,780 --> 01:01:22,870
Someone just tried to rob us.

929
01:01:22,990 --> 01:01:25,740
I... I think she had
a bomb strapped to her.

930
01:01:27,740 --> 01:01:29,280
Oh, I almost died.

931
01:02:42,770 --> 01:02:43,810
Hello, Mr. Bugs.

932
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:45,180
Hey, you got my money?

933
01:02:46,270 --> 01:02:48,520
Yes. I have your money.
Where can I come?

934
01:02:48,670 --> 01:02:50,310
Do you have all my money?

935
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:53,060
Right now I have 10,000.
But...

936
01:02:53,140 --> 01:02:55,810
Who the hell do you think I am?
A vacuum cleaner salesman?

937
01:02:56,060 --> 01:02:57,640
There ain't no installments witch!

938
01:02:58,270 --> 01:03:02,140
I want the whole 50,000 dollars!
- For that I need one month.

939
01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:05,680
Hell no!

940
01:03:06,140 --> 01:03:07,060
You got ten days!

941
01:03:07,140 --> 01:03:09,390
Mr. Bugs?
- You hear me? Ten days!

942
01:03:31,740 --> 01:03:32,480
What?

943
01:03:33,390 --> 01:03:36,020
I think I've kept my top
in your cupboard by mistake.

944
01:03:36,140 --> 01:03:37,020
I'm just taking that.

945
01:03:37,140 --> 01:03:38,230
Go. I'll get it for you.

946
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:39,430
Move aside.

947
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:41,850
What treasure are you hiding inside?

948
01:03:42,730 --> 01:03:43,770
Where is it?

949
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:47,850
Mummy, I don't have
any privacy in this house.

950
01:03:48,020 --> 01:03:51,430
Where... Ah.

951
01:03:52,770 --> 01:03:53,730
Found it.

952
01:03:55,430 --> 01:03:59,730
Look Praful, I don't like
locked doors and locked cupboards.

953
01:04:00,070 --> 01:04:02,020
You don't hide anything
from your family.

954
01:04:02,140 --> 01:04:03,020
Do you understand?

955
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:27,480
Praful...

956
01:04:28,140 --> 01:04:29,810
Listen... please help me out today.

957
01:04:29,980 --> 01:04:32,520
I need to go to Asif's school
to pick up his report card.

958
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:33,730
Okay, okay.

959
01:04:33,980 --> 01:04:35,600
Okay, okay, okay. No problem.

960
01:04:38,180 --> 01:04:40,480
Eleventh's west wing, right?
- Yeah.

961
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:42,060
Okay, okay. Coming, coming.

962
01:04:52,930 --> 01:04:53,930
'In today's headlines:'

963
01:04:54,060 --> 01:04:57,480
'A heavily armed woman robbed the
Barret Goodrich Bank of Atlanta.'

964
01:04:58,930 --> 01:05:00,930
Praful... heard that?

965
01:05:01,020 --> 01:05:03,560
'The cashier visibly
shaken by the episode...'

966
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:05,480
'...described her as heavily
armed and dangerous.'

967
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:06,210
'She had a bomb.'

968
01:05:06,290 --> 01:05:11,370
Look how they are robbing banks in broad
daylight. - 'I couldn't see her face...'

969
01:05:11,450 --> 01:05:15,560
'FBI is on a lookout for a petite
woman olive skin possibly Asian.'

970
01:05:15,830 --> 01:05:19,770
'Heavily armed who used a peculiar note to
rob the Barrack Goodrich Bank in Atlanta.'

971
01:05:19,980 --> 01:05:22,440
What was peculiar about
the bank robber's operation..

972
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:24,120
..was that the note
was written with a...

973
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:26,770
'Brace yourself... a lipstick.'

974
01:05:27,250 --> 01:05:28,310
Oh God!

975
01:05:28,390 --> 01:05:29,600
'And I was so scared.'

976
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:33,730
'I almost died in there.' - To buy bombs is
nowadays as easy as buying groceries.

977
01:05:33,940 --> 01:05:35,850
'I don't want to stay
in America anymore.'

978
01:05:35,930 --> 01:05:38,430
Now our money is not
even safe in the bank.

979
01:05:38,510 --> 01:05:41,350
Look how they use
a lipstick to rob banks!

980
01:05:58,260 --> 01:06:00,270
"She is agile."

981
01:06:00,350 --> 01:06:02,230
"She has attitude." "She is restless."

982
01:06:02,310 --> 01:06:05,430
"She can steal the sky
within a blink of an eye."

983
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:07,980
"Known, yet unknown..."

984
01:06:08,060 --> 01:06:09,930
"A little crazy."

985
01:06:10,010 --> 01:06:12,710
"She makes everyone go crazy."

986
01:06:13,910 --> 01:06:20,700
"She complicates the dilemma of the
heart and mind while simplifying it."

987
01:06:25,650 --> 01:06:29,150
"Who knows where you'll go next."

988
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:37,150
"Who knows where you'll go next."

989
01:06:37,730 --> 01:06:42,200
Hey guys, this week I am going
to teach you how to rob a bank.

990
01:06:45,260 --> 01:06:48,960
Step One: Find yourself
the right bank.

991
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:56,450
She's little too much
a little too little...

992
01:06:56,720 --> 01:07:00,510
A tempting danger...

993
01:07:00,590 --> 01:07:04,180
Incomplete stories and empty pockets...

994
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:07,940
Still dreams big...

995
01:07:08,020 --> 01:07:11,810
Attracting like a magnet...

996
01:07:11,890 --> 01:07:15,630
She hides them in her fist...

997
01:07:15,710 --> 01:07:18,320
With her deep eyes...

998
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:21,950
Whenever she look at someone heart.

999
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:29,440
Step Two: You have to find something
with which you can spook the cashiers.

1000
01:07:34,670 --> 01:07:37,520
"Who knows where you'll go next."

1001
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:41,140
Once the cashiers are spooked,
you don't have to do anything.

1002
01:07:41,230 --> 01:07:42,310
You just get the money.

1003
01:07:42,390 --> 01:07:44,600
You walk into the bank empty-handed.

1004
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:47,360
And you walk out of the
bank with a sack of cash.

1005
01:07:57,710 --> 01:08:01,460
"Who knows where you'll go next."

1006
01:08:05,170 --> 01:08:09,090
"Who knows where you'll go next."

1007
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:15,480
So robbing a bank is as
easy as making a cup of coffee.

1008
01:08:15,560 --> 01:08:17,930
After everything that has
been happening in the world..

1009
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:21,100
..everybody is afraid of a threat.

1010
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:23,600
And we can use that.

1011
01:08:26,290 --> 01:08:28,110
So, on next week's tutorial:

1012
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:30,850
How to kill somebody
and not get caught.

1013
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:32,230
Ever.

1014
01:09:02,570 --> 01:09:03,560
Praful!

1015
01:09:04,850 --> 01:09:06,180
Yes?
- Praful!

1016
01:09:06,260 --> 01:09:07,140
YES!

1017
01:09:08,180 --> 01:09:09,390
Come here!

1018
01:09:11,460 --> 01:09:12,640
Praful!

1019
01:09:12,770 --> 01:09:14,140
Praful, come inside.

1020
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:15,810
Yes? What is it?

1021
01:09:16,350 --> 01:09:18,480
Hey, what are you wearing?

1022
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:19,680
Jogging suit.

1023
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:21,310
You are anyway so slim.

1024
01:09:21,430 --> 01:09:25,060
Don't do any jogging,
the glow on your face will disappear.

1025
01:09:27,020 --> 01:09:30,060
Tell me quickly, what is it?
I'll get late.

1026
01:09:30,270 --> 01:09:33,730
Instead of jogging let's
join a yoga class together.

1027
01:09:33,850 --> 01:09:35,100
I'll get late.

1028
01:09:35,180 --> 01:09:37,480
At least that won't take
away the glow on your face.

1029
01:09:38,210 --> 01:09:39,430
Can I go, mummy?

1030
01:09:40,390 --> 01:09:41,890
Go Simran, go.

1031
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:49,600
No boy can love you more than he does.

1032
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:51,850
Go, my child.

1033
01:09:52,850 --> 01:09:54,640
Go to your Raj.

1034
01:09:55,390 --> 01:09:56,520
Go, Simran.

1035
01:09:57,060 --> 01:09:59,270
Go, live your life!
- Go Simran, go.

1036
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:01,640
Live your life!
- Go, my child. Go!

1037
01:10:03,730 --> 01:10:05,560
Simran! Praful!

1038
01:10:06,140 --> 01:10:08,060
Get curd on your way back!

1039
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:10,730
I am making 'Thepla'
(flatbread) for breakfast.

1040
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:03,060
Hey! How are you?

1041
01:11:03,350 --> 01:11:05,480
Come come come,
have a seat, have a seat.

1042
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:06,680
How can I help you today?

1043
01:11:06,810 --> 01:11:08,350
Sit sit sit, come on.

1044
01:11:14,430 --> 01:11:15,930
My name's Veena Malik.

1045
01:11:16,390 --> 01:11:18,140
And I can help you today.

1046
01:11:18,270 --> 01:11:19,980
How's it going?
- Good.

1047
01:11:20,060 --> 01:11:22,310
Do you have an account with us?
- No.

1048
01:11:22,390 --> 01:11:25,730
No? Well,
zero balance account is fantastic.

1049
01:11:25,930 --> 01:11:29,430
By the way,
I love the color of you hair.

1050
01:11:29,810 --> 01:11:31,520
It's gorgeous!

1051
01:11:32,020 --> 01:11:33,350
So what's your name?

1052
01:11:35,680 --> 01:11:36,600
Simran?

1053
01:11:37,430 --> 01:11:40,350
Simran! Now that's a beautiful name.

1054
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:41,640
Simran!

1055
01:11:41,770 --> 01:11:44,810
Simran, can I have your ID please?

1056
01:11:47,310 --> 01:11:49,480
It is in the car.
- Okay. No problem.

1057
01:11:49,930 --> 01:11:53,890
Why don't you get your ID from your
car and I'll get a form started for you?

1058
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:56,560
Okay.
- Okay?

1059
01:11:56,770 --> 01:11:58,140
Great! Fantastic!

1060
01:11:58,430 --> 01:12:00,630
I'll see you in a little bit.
- Okay.

1061
01:12:03,670 --> 01:12:07,050
Alright, I'll see you.

1062
01:12:09,250 --> 01:12:10,870
"That's Simran!"

1063
01:12:10,950 --> 01:12:12,630
"Hobbledehoy Simran!"

1064
01:12:13,300 --> 01:12:16,600
"Who knows where you'll go next."

1065
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:18,470
"That's Simran!"

1066
01:12:18,550 --> 01:12:20,720
"Fly away Simran!"

1067
01:12:20,990 --> 01:12:24,490
"Who knows where you'll go next."

1068
01:12:24,570 --> 01:12:27,650
Many dreams dwell in her eyes.

1069
01:12:27,730 --> 01:12:28,870
Many dreams...

1070
01:12:28,950 --> 01:12:32,710
They keep flying aimlessly.

1071
01:12:33,070 --> 01:12:35,370
Peeping out through the eyes.

1072
01:12:35,450 --> 01:12:38,880
This poor helpless
mind filled with dreams.

1073
01:12:39,740 --> 01:12:41,140
"That's Simran!"

1074
01:12:41,650 --> 01:12:43,250
"Hobbledehoy Simran!"

1075
01:12:44,050 --> 01:12:47,320
"Who knows where you'll go next."

1076
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:49,230
"That's Simran!"

1077
01:12:49,310 --> 01:12:51,450
"Fly away Simran!"

1078
01:12:51,730 --> 01:12:55,370
"Who knows where you'll go next."

1079
01:12:55,580 --> 01:12:57,160
"Hey Simran!"

1080
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:23,180
7000! Bloody misers!

1081
01:13:33,480 --> 01:13:34,850
'She was terrifying.'

1082
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:38,430
'She had olive skin.'

1083
01:13:40,490 --> 01:13:45,270
'She had sharp features and...and...
explosives around her waist.'

1084
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:47,890
'She was middle eastern.'

1085
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:52,640
'Definitely,
definitely trained by Al-Qaeda.'

1086
01:13:59,320 --> 01:14:01,900
'The suspect is believed
to be Asian or Middle Eastern.'

1087
01:14:02,410 --> 01:14:04,850
Why are they always Muslims?

1088
01:14:07,330 --> 01:14:11,640
Papa, what do you think,
why do only Muslims do such things?

1089
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:15,850
Dear, it's the caste and the religion
which sets a person's mentality.

1090
01:14:15,980 --> 01:14:18,100
It is not her caste
or religion's fault.

1091
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:19,770
The fault lies in her upbringing.

1092
01:14:20,270 --> 01:14:24,230
Mummy, that means
she had a bad upbringing.

1093
01:14:24,310 --> 01:14:26,980
Yes. - Hundred percent.
I can give it in writing.

1094
01:14:27,180 --> 01:14:30,100
Her father must be useless, right?

1095
01:14:30,230 --> 01:14:32,410
Hundred percent.
I can give that too in writing.

1096
01:14:33,770 --> 01:14:36,140
He must be totally useless!
- 'Armed and extremely dangerous.'

1097
01:14:36,220 --> 01:14:39,680
'Witnesses have reported she's wearing
a jacket equipped with explosives.'

1098
01:14:40,270 --> 01:14:43,680
'We can also tell you at this time she's
writing notes with red lipstick.'

1099
01:14:44,140 --> 01:14:45,890
'Those lipstick notes
are in evidence..'

1100
01:14:46,020 --> 01:14:49,350
'..and being examined for poisons
and other biological hazards.'

1101
01:14:49,680 --> 01:14:50,850
That's all for now.

1102
01:14:59,990 --> 01:15:00,940
What all have you brought?

1103
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:03,640
I've brought 'Handvo', 'Fafda'
and 'Ghatiya' (Gujarati snacks).

1104
01:15:03,770 --> 01:15:05,270
And some lemonade too.

1105
01:15:05,390 --> 01:15:07,140
Lemonade's a waste.

1106
01:15:07,270 --> 01:15:08,770
Look there, they are drinking beer.

1107
01:15:23,140 --> 01:15:25,480
Do you always go
out with your uncle and aunt?

1108
01:15:25,980 --> 01:15:27,390
No, it's not so.

1109
01:15:27,680 --> 01:15:29,730
I don't have any other way
to meet you.

1110
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:32,600
You know how many phone
calls I made to your father?

1111
01:15:33,020 --> 01:15:34,680
He must be fed up!

1112
01:15:35,350 --> 01:15:37,270
Why didn't you ask me for my number?

1113
01:15:39,270 --> 01:15:40,810
I don't know.
- Shall we sit here?

1114
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:42,560
Yeah, sure. Please.

1115
01:15:46,430 --> 01:15:48,430
You are a good boy.

1116
01:15:48,700 --> 01:15:50,810
You go meet the girl
with your guardians.

1117
01:15:51,020 --> 01:15:52,810
You wear tailored pants and shirts.

1118
01:15:53,100 --> 01:15:55,810
You are simple, decent Mr. Right.

1119
01:15:56,610 --> 01:15:58,230
Don't get fooled by my dressing sense.

1120
01:15:58,310 --> 01:16:01,100
I agree that my dress
sense isn't great.

1121
01:16:01,620 --> 01:16:03,310
But you'll be accusing
me if you call me simple.

1122
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:05,810
Oh really?
Okay then prove otherwise.

1123
01:16:06,580 --> 01:16:08,560
I've been expelled
from college, twice.

1124
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:12,310
People still talk about
me at Banaras University Campus.

1125
01:16:13,140 --> 01:16:14,730
I had to shoulder a lot of
responsibilities at a young age..

1126
01:16:14,810 --> 01:16:16,930
..hence I had to finish
college and take up a job.

1127
01:16:17,780 --> 01:16:19,980
When one has to shoulder
responsibilities at a young age..

1128
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:22,980
... he might look fine from outside...

1129
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:26,930
... but he comes a little
hollow from inside.

1130
01:16:34,630 --> 01:16:36,310
When I see you, I always ask myself...

1131
01:16:36,850 --> 01:16:38,730
How can someone be
so complete in oneself?

1132
01:16:43,550 --> 01:16:47,560
To see you breathe also seems
like an achievement in itself.

1133
01:16:53,020 --> 01:16:54,480
You hardly know me.

1134
01:16:54,770 --> 01:16:58,480
I believe that you can
never completely know a person.

1135
01:17:00,230 --> 01:17:02,140
Because it's human nature to change.

1136
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:05,980
Change is the only constant.

1137
01:17:08,190 --> 01:17:11,140
I believe that you shouldn't
try to understand relationships.

1138
01:17:11,570 --> 01:17:13,230
You should just be true to them.

1139
01:17:14,180 --> 01:17:17,410
I agree that you can never
completely understand anyone.

1140
01:17:17,490 --> 01:17:19,480
But you can at least
try to know a person.

1141
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:21,930
Who am I? What is my nature?

1142
01:17:22,020 --> 01:17:24,180
Do I have a character flaw?

1143
01:17:25,810 --> 01:17:28,890
I believe that I am a very
progressive kind of a person.

1144
01:17:29,770 --> 01:17:33,310
Yes, even I would want my
partner to be loyal after marriage.

1145
01:17:34,180 --> 01:17:38,480
But if you had any boyfriends
or if you still do..

1146
01:17:39,100 --> 01:17:40,850
... then that won't make
any difference to me.

1147
01:17:42,680 --> 01:17:44,980
Having boyfriends
isn't a character flaw.

1148
01:17:45,230 --> 01:17:46,850
To have boyfriends is a talent.

1149
01:17:47,230 --> 01:17:50,230
I am talking about
real character flaws.

1150
01:17:51,180 --> 01:17:52,390
Bad habits?

1151
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:53,450
What do you mean?

1152
01:17:57,230 --> 01:17:58,640
I mean...

1153
01:17:59,850 --> 01:18:01,980
How do I tell you?
Try taking a guess.

1154
01:18:04,590 --> 01:18:05,560
Tell me.

1155
01:18:08,920 --> 01:18:09,810
I think...

1156
01:18:09,890 --> 01:18:13,060
I... I'm nervous.

1157
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:18,930
Look straight ahead.

1158
01:18:22,350 --> 01:18:23,310
Okay.

1159
01:18:24,850 --> 01:18:26,350
I'm going to tell you, okay? - Okay.

1160
01:18:28,060 --> 01:18:29,850
I'm addicted to gambling and stealing.

1161
01:18:43,750 --> 01:18:45,350
You are so funny!

1162
01:18:48,770 --> 01:18:52,520
What did you say?
Addicted to gambling and stealing.

1163
01:18:53,140 --> 01:18:54,890
You have a great sense of humor.

1164
01:19:37,300 --> 01:19:38,390
How are you today?

1165
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:41,390
Okay.

1166
01:20:03,560 --> 01:20:04,680
Oh, my God!

1167
01:20:05,140 --> 01:20:06,310
Oh, my God!

1168
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:12,020
John! John! Oh, my God! Are you okay?

1169
01:20:12,850 --> 01:20:15,260
I'll get a refill for your inhaler.

1170
01:20:17,060 --> 01:20:18,350
Please.

1171
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:29,590
I'm... a single parent. Please don't...
- It's okay. I can go to another bank.

1172
01:20:43,610 --> 01:20:47,820
'She was about 5'6'',
5'7", olive skin, purple hair.'

1173
01:20:47,900 --> 01:20:49,930
'She even gave me her name in fact.'

1174
01:20:50,010 --> 01:20:51,730
'What name did she give?'

1175
01:20:52,860 --> 01:20:54,310
'I think Simran.'

1176
01:20:54,520 --> 01:20:55,520
'Simran it was.'

1177
01:20:55,640 --> 01:20:59,350
'Meanwhile at J&R Federal
Bank near Griffin Georgia.'

1178
01:20:59,430 --> 01:21:02,640
'A teller has been rushed
to the county hospital.'

1179
01:21:03,010 --> 01:21:07,780
'The threat of Simran, the lipstick
bandit rendered him unconscious.'

1180
01:21:08,180 --> 01:21:11,080
'While not critical,
he's currently under observation.'

1181
01:21:11,220 --> 01:21:15,290
'And we await updates from
the hospital on his condition.'

1182
01:21:45,150 --> 01:21:46,810
Hello, Mr.Bugs?

1183
01:21:46,930 --> 01:21:48,180
Hey, hey!

1184
01:21:48,330 --> 01:21:50,140
I'm glad I didn't have to remind you.

1185
01:21:50,740 --> 01:21:52,180
You wouldn't have liked that.

1186
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:54,180
Where can I come with your money?

1187
01:21:55,020 --> 01:21:56,430
I'll come to you, baby.

1188
01:21:56,750 --> 01:21:59,430
Bugs will go anywhere for his 50,000.

1189
01:22:01,390 --> 01:22:04,850
I am falling short of eight thousand.
- No-no-no-no.

1190
01:22:07,020 --> 01:22:09,890
You don't wanna do that.
I need all my money.

1191
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:11,520
Then I need two more days!

1192
01:22:11,670 --> 01:22:15,520
Listen! - Two more days!
Please? Please.

1193
01:22:22,870 --> 01:22:25,160
Did I disturb your makeup session?

1194
01:22:25,410 --> 01:22:26,490
What's the hurry?

1195
01:22:26,700 --> 01:22:28,910
Your shift began an hour ago.

1196
01:22:29,160 --> 01:22:31,530
Everyone else is here to do your work.

1197
01:22:31,850 --> 01:22:33,240
Shall I send anything for you?

1198
01:22:33,410 --> 01:22:34,820
Green tea, juice?

1199
01:22:34,990 --> 01:22:35,990
What do you want?

1200
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:37,280
Go and get juice.

1201
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:40,700
Don't use your sarcasm on me, Mike!

1202
01:22:40,820 --> 01:22:42,820
Lower your voice when you speak to me.

1203
01:22:42,950 --> 01:22:44,660
And you don't act so bossy!

1204
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:47,530
I work for the hotel industry.
Not for you!

1205
01:23:06,490 --> 01:23:07,280
Praful!

1206
01:23:08,570 --> 01:23:10,810
Sameer! - You know,
I was just thinking about you!

1207
01:23:11,240 --> 01:23:12,280
What are you doing over here?

1208
01:23:12,370 --> 01:23:13,780
I'd come to withdraw some cash.

1209
01:23:13,910 --> 01:23:14,780
And you?

1210
01:23:15,470 --> 01:23:16,370
I was...

1211
01:23:16,810 --> 01:23:18,030
...Preparing to rob the bank.

1212
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:20,530
Are you prepared?

1213
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:23,620
You are so funny.

1214
01:23:23,990 --> 01:23:25,240
Come on, rob the bank later.

1215
01:23:25,320 --> 01:23:26,530
I'll treat you with
a nice cup of coffee first.

1216
01:23:26,710 --> 01:23:29,240
No, I...I am getting late.
I have to leave.

1217
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:30,740
Five minutes. Just five minutes.

1218
01:23:30,870 --> 01:23:31,780
Come on.

1219
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:55,030
Would you like to
see my favorite place?

1220
01:23:55,910 --> 01:23:57,240
Weren't you getting late?

1221
01:23:57,870 --> 01:23:58,780
So what?

1222
01:23:58,870 --> 01:24:01,660
I'll do 15 minutes
extra overtime. Just for you.

1223
01:24:03,450 --> 01:24:04,910
Whatever you say!

1224
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:20,530
How did you like this place?

1225
01:24:20,790 --> 01:24:21,950
It's very beautiful.

1226
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:24,490
Do you come here alone?

1227
01:24:24,830 --> 01:24:25,740
Yes.

1228
01:24:26,370 --> 01:24:27,490
You mean all alone?

1229
01:24:27,740 --> 01:24:30,120
What else does alone mean?

1230
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:32,280
I mean this place is so quiet.

1231
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,240
And you aren't one of
those who can keep quiet.

1232
01:24:35,720 --> 01:24:37,280
What do you do here?

1233
01:24:37,850 --> 01:24:39,820
That's a secret.

1234
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:43,320
If you find out, you'd lose your life.

1235
01:24:45,740 --> 01:24:47,240
But I have seen the place.

1236
01:24:47,740 --> 01:24:49,070
So I've lost half my life?

1237
01:24:50,120 --> 01:24:51,640
What will I do with the other half?

1238
01:24:52,370 --> 01:24:53,370
You might as well take that too.

1239
01:24:54,240 --> 01:24:55,160
Come here.

1240
01:25:04,580 --> 01:25:06,240
Breathe the fresh air. Feel it.

1241
01:25:13,790 --> 01:25:15,240
This air is totally free.

1242
01:25:16,580 --> 01:25:18,700
No building can stop it.

1243
01:25:19,070 --> 01:25:20,570
No obstacle can bind it.

1244
01:25:24,700 --> 01:25:26,070
When I come here,...

1245
01:25:27,140 --> 01:25:33,110
... I feel tiny wings sprouting out...

1246
01:25:33,380 --> 01:25:35,410
... like that of a butterfly...

1247
01:25:36,710 --> 01:25:38,570
And then they start flapping.

1248
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:41,240
Can you see my wings?

1249
01:25:41,660 --> 01:25:42,950
Yes.

1250
01:25:43,450 --> 01:25:44,370
They are big.

1251
01:25:44,620 --> 01:25:48,850
I flap them and then I fly away!

1252
01:25:52,360 --> 01:25:56,020
Don't jog.
People come here only to fly.

1253
01:26:10,740 --> 01:26:19,490
"It's like my blank
heart found poetry."

1254
01:26:20,750 --> 01:26:29,220
"It's like love has showered
like rain for the first time."

1255
01:26:30,770 --> 01:26:35,330
"What I looked for in every eye.."

1256
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:40,300
"I found that loyalty in you."

1257
01:26:40,700 --> 01:26:45,700
"You are my life."

1258
01:26:45,780 --> 01:26:49,000
"I know that."

1259
01:26:49,270 --> 01:26:53,700
"You are my companion."

1260
01:26:54,240 --> 01:26:58,750
"You are my love."

1261
01:26:58,830 --> 01:27:03,750
"The one my lips cannot stop singing..."

1262
01:27:04,160 --> 01:27:08,660
"You are that song for me."

1263
01:27:08,870 --> 01:27:11,950
Authorities are working diligently
to identify this female suspect.

1264
01:27:12,070 --> 01:27:13,780
We are trying to determine
if she is working alone..

1265
01:27:13,870 --> 01:27:16,370
..or if she is a part of
a larger organized crime syndicate.

1266
01:27:16,870 --> 01:27:17,990
The public needs to be aware.

1267
01:27:18,070 --> 01:27:21,030
This suspect is considered
armed and extremely dangerous.

1268
01:27:21,160 --> 01:27:24,570
Witnesses have reported she's wearing
a jacket equipped with explosives.

1269
01:27:54,280 --> 01:27:58,760
"You are my companion."

1270
01:27:59,270 --> 01:28:03,720
"You are my love."

1271
01:28:04,180 --> 01:28:08,870
"The one my lips cannot stop singing..."

1272
01:28:09,190 --> 01:28:13,730
"You are that song for me."

1273
01:28:14,250 --> 01:28:18,780
"You are my companion."

1274
01:28:19,220 --> 01:28:23,770
"You are my love."

1275
01:28:24,190 --> 01:28:28,690
"The one my lips cannot stop singing..."

1276
01:28:29,190 --> 01:28:33,860
"You are that song for me."

1277
01:28:34,260 --> 01:28:40,130
"You are my companion."

1278
01:28:58,160 --> 01:29:01,700
Where is my money?
Where's my money, huh?

1279
01:29:02,410 --> 01:29:03,440
Get up!

1280
01:29:06,740 --> 01:29:08,620
Where is it?

1281
01:29:08,740 --> 01:29:10,200
I told you I'd come for my money

1282
01:29:10,280 --> 01:29:11,670
Oh, my God!
- I told you!

1283
01:29:11,750 --> 01:29:12,910
Security!

1284
01:29:12,990 --> 01:29:15,090
Where is my money?
Where is it?

1285
01:29:15,240 --> 01:29:16,370
Where is my money!

1286
01:29:16,450 --> 01:29:17,910
I told you I'd come for my money.

1287
01:29:18,030 --> 01:29:19,870
Where is my money!
- Who the hell are you?

1288
01:29:19,950 --> 01:29:21,490
No, this bitch owes me money!
- Stand down!

1289
01:29:21,570 --> 01:29:23,490
She ran away with 50,000
dollars of my money!

1290
01:29:23,570 --> 01:29:25,070
This is our personal matter!

1291
01:29:25,150 --> 01:29:26,490
This is our personal matter...

1292
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:28,490
I'll meet you outside my house...

1293
01:29:29,490 --> 01:29:30,780
With your money...

1294
01:29:31,240 --> 01:29:32,350
Please?

1295
01:29:42,280 --> 01:29:44,700
You cannot bring your
personal matters here.

1296
01:29:46,700 --> 01:29:49,070
I have to report to the manager.

1297
01:30:07,590 --> 01:30:11,070
But nothing like this happened
from my end in last seven years.

1298
01:30:11,400 --> 01:30:13,030
Please don't suspend me.

1299
01:30:13,320 --> 01:30:15,870
If you do not vacate
the premises immediately...

1300
01:30:15,990 --> 01:30:18,070
Forget suspension, I will sack you.

1301
01:30:18,660 --> 01:30:21,530
Sir...
- Now, to be clear, one last time..

1302
01:30:21,740 --> 01:30:25,820
You are suspended without
pay for three months.

1303
01:30:26,150 --> 01:30:27,410
And you should consider
yourself lucky.

1304
01:30:27,490 --> 01:30:30,700
For anyone else,
I would've not been so lenient.

1305
01:30:31,410 --> 01:30:33,030
Sir, please...
- Ms. Patel!

1306
01:30:33,370 --> 01:30:36,450
The next step is I call security,
do you understand?

1307
01:31:04,280 --> 01:31:06,620
Praful! What happened, Praful?

1308
01:31:06,740 --> 01:31:08,240
Is something missing?
- Where is my money?

1309
01:31:08,370 --> 01:31:10,280
We didn't touch it.
- Where is my money?

1310
01:31:10,410 --> 01:31:11,410
Which money, Praful?

1311
01:31:11,490 --> 01:31:13,740
I'd kept some money here. Here...

1312
01:31:14,070 --> 01:31:15,070
Who...
- Which money?

1313
01:31:15,150 --> 01:31:16,490
Who opened my locker?!

1314
01:31:17,320 --> 01:31:19,160
We don't have the key to your locker.

1315
01:31:19,490 --> 01:31:21,200
Only admin has the master keys.

1316
01:31:21,280 --> 01:31:24,160
No one can get anything
without Mike's sanction.

1317
01:31:24,280 --> 01:31:25,720
Mike... yes, Mike.

1318
01:31:25,950 --> 01:31:27,530
Mike...
- Praful!

1319
01:31:29,160 --> 01:31:31,320
Mike, where is my money?

1320
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:33,950
You don't enter a
manager's office without...

1321
01:31:34,030 --> 01:31:35,530
Where is my money?!

1322
01:31:35,910 --> 01:31:37,030
Which money?

1323
01:31:37,220 --> 01:31:38,530
The money you stole?

1324
01:31:38,780 --> 01:31:41,370
Mike!
Mike, I am going to kill you!

1325
01:31:41,510 --> 01:31:43,160
Mike...Mike give my money.

1326
01:31:43,240 --> 01:31:44,740
Give my money!
- You b*tch!

1327
01:31:46,780 --> 01:31:49,280
Mike!
- Oh shit!

1328
01:31:50,490 --> 01:31:52,320
Hey! Security!

1329
01:31:52,450 --> 01:31:56,030
Mike, give my money!
- Hey! Somebody help!

1330
01:31:56,110 --> 01:31:57,280
Give my money!

1331
01:31:58,450 --> 01:32:01,450
Security!
- Give my money! Give my money!

1332
01:32:01,570 --> 01:32:02,780
Security!

1333
01:32:04,740 --> 01:32:06,700
Send somebody here, quick!

1334
01:32:06,820 --> 01:32:08,720
Give me my money!
- Get off!

1335
01:32:10,280 --> 01:32:12,700
Mike! Mike! Give my money!
- Get her out!

1336
01:32:12,780 --> 01:32:13,960
Mike, give my money!

1337
01:32:14,040 --> 01:32:15,490
Leave me, Leave me! - If she
comes back I'll have her arrested.

1338
01:32:15,570 --> 01:32:18,450
Mike, give my money! Mike! Mike!

1339
01:32:19,070 --> 01:32:22,660
Leave me, leave me!
Okay, leave me, I'll go on my own!

1340
01:32:43,200 --> 01:32:44,450
Praful!

1341
01:32:48,710 --> 01:32:50,040
Thank you.

1342
01:32:51,410 --> 01:32:52,660
Thank you.

1343
01:33:54,240 --> 01:33:56,660
Try this 'Ghatiya'
from Rajkot. - Okay.

1344
01:33:57,320 --> 01:33:59,410
It's a very tasty snack.
- It's special.

1345
01:33:59,490 --> 01:34:00,660
Very nice.

1346
01:34:04,530 --> 01:34:05,620
Hello, dear.

1347
01:34:05,910 --> 01:34:07,070
Hard day's work?

1348
01:34:13,950 --> 01:34:15,320
She works very hard.

1349
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:16,950
She gets tired, poor girl.

1350
01:34:17,610 --> 01:34:18,700
Praful!

1351
01:34:18,820 --> 01:34:20,200
Freshen up and come out.

1352
01:34:22,910 --> 01:34:25,990
Mohan, the kids have
made their decision.

1353
01:34:26,120 --> 01:34:27,490
What should we do next?

1354
01:34:28,120 --> 01:34:29,950
Whatever you think is fine.

1355
01:34:30,410 --> 01:34:34,450
I'll call up the priest at Nathdwara and
ask him to suggest an auspicious hour.

1356
01:34:34,570 --> 01:34:36,280
If they want an engagement
then we'll get them engaged...

1357
01:34:36,410 --> 01:34:37,570
... or else get them married.

1358
01:34:37,700 --> 01:34:40,450
No, sister. I'd suggest
we get them married immediately.

1359
01:34:41,450 --> 01:34:43,700
What do you say? - Uncle,
I wanted to say something to you.

1360
01:34:44,450 --> 01:34:47,240
Actually, I've got into
UC Davies university. - Okay.

1361
01:34:47,320 --> 01:34:49,910
It's one of the good
universities in California.

1362
01:34:50,910 --> 01:34:52,950
We will have to shift
there after our marriage.

1363
01:34:53,240 --> 01:34:54,280
I have spoken to Praful.

1364
01:34:54,370 --> 01:34:56,780
She'll try if she can
get her job transferred there.

1365
01:34:57,700 --> 01:34:59,780
We just need your permission.

1366
01:35:00,450 --> 01:35:02,820
No problem.
Daughters are meant to be sent away.

1367
01:35:02,900 --> 01:35:04,160
She's all yours!

1368
01:35:05,870 --> 01:35:07,120
On that note,
try the 'Gulab Jamuns' (sweets).

1369
01:35:15,990 --> 01:35:17,240
I am coming out.

1370
01:35:19,200 --> 01:35:21,700
12th is a Friday.
- Check when's the full moon day.

1371
01:35:21,910 --> 01:35:24,160
Full moon day, I think 20th or 21st.
- Full moon day will be an auspicious day.

1372
01:35:26,120 --> 01:35:28,070
We'll also have to talk to Kaushal.

1373
01:35:55,370 --> 01:35:58,240
I had the money! Somebody stole it!

1374
01:35:58,620 --> 01:36:00,070
No more lies b*tch!

1375
01:36:00,150 --> 01:36:02,530
She is not lying. She had the money.

1376
01:36:03,700 --> 01:36:06,280
Isn't that right, Simran?
You had the money.

1377
01:36:06,370 --> 01:36:07,490
Simran?

1378
01:36:08,240 --> 01:36:10,160
You called us after every heist.

1379
01:36:11,240 --> 01:36:13,070
I thought she was dumb, Bugs.

1380
01:36:13,320 --> 01:36:17,240
She's smart. She is very very smart.

1381
01:36:17,620 --> 01:36:21,570
Far too talented to be
wasting her life cleaning rooms.

1382
01:36:26,280 --> 01:36:28,030
You think she can work with us?

1383
01:36:31,030 --> 01:36:32,370
You're vicious.

1384
01:36:33,320 --> 01:36:36,240
Join us, make millions.

1385
01:36:37,160 --> 01:36:39,030
I don't want to make millions.

1386
01:36:39,200 --> 01:36:41,200
I just want to return your money.

1387
01:36:41,280 --> 01:36:45,950
Then stop using lipstick
notes and start using this.

1388
01:36:47,700 --> 01:36:49,870
Get it all in one go.

1389
01:36:50,870 --> 01:36:53,370
Be our Robin Hood.
- Hell ya!

1390
01:36:54,240 --> 01:36:56,200
Robin Hood?
- Robin Hood.

1391
01:36:56,410 --> 01:37:00,450
You rob from the rich...and
help us poor people out.

1392
01:37:03,550 --> 01:37:07,700
'Coz you outta options baby,
the cops are onto you.

1393
01:37:20,910 --> 01:37:22,410
I will get your money.

1394
01:37:35,280 --> 01:37:36,450
Who were those people?

1395
01:37:37,780 --> 01:37:38,910
Who were they?

1396
01:37:39,030 --> 01:37:40,160
How does that concern you?

1397
01:37:40,910 --> 01:37:43,200
What is wrong with you?
Why are you talking like this?

1398
01:37:43,820 --> 01:37:45,280
I just asked who were those people?

1399
01:37:45,430 --> 01:37:47,620
Just because we smiled,
laughed together for a few days..

1400
01:37:47,780 --> 01:37:49,240
.. you started
owning me?

1401
01:37:49,770 --> 01:37:51,030
What do you mean?

1402
01:37:51,630 --> 01:37:53,370
We are going to get married, Praful.

1403
01:37:53,950 --> 01:37:55,930
So it is important that we
know everything about each other.

1404
01:37:56,010 --> 01:37:58,490
You want to know everything?

1405
01:37:58,620 --> 01:38:00,450
Those guys were my friends.

1406
01:38:00,530 --> 01:38:04,240
When I lost all my money gambling,
they gave me a loan.

1407
01:38:04,320 --> 01:38:06,990
And I started robbing
banks to repay that loan.

1408
01:38:07,110 --> 01:38:08,240
Sameer!

1409
01:38:08,410 --> 01:38:09,990
Auntie is asking what will you have?

1410
01:38:10,070 --> 01:38:11,370
'Gulam Jamun' or
'Raas Malia' (sweets)?

1411
01:38:11,570 --> 01:38:12,490
They are both fresh.

1412
01:38:12,870 --> 01:38:14,160
Give me a minute, uncle.

1413
01:38:17,820 --> 01:38:18,990
What?

1414
01:38:23,410 --> 01:38:24,660
Got scared, Sameer?

1415
01:38:27,110 --> 01:38:28,370
How much do you owe them?

1416
01:38:28,540 --> 01:38:29,870
50,000 dollars.

1417
01:38:30,990 --> 01:38:32,910
That's your MBA fees.

1418
01:38:33,050 --> 01:38:35,070
What happened Sameer,
why did you run away?

1419
01:38:35,240 --> 01:38:36,530
Sameer?

1420
01:38:37,210 --> 01:38:39,280
Let me finish, Sameer!

1421
01:38:39,450 --> 01:38:42,780
After that the stolen
money got stolen.

1422
01:38:43,660 --> 01:38:44,620
Let's go, uncle.

1423
01:38:44,700 --> 01:38:45,780
Where?
- Please let's just go.

1424
01:38:45,990 --> 01:38:47,450
Where do you want to go?
- Let's go, please.

1425
01:38:47,570 --> 01:38:49,200
What happened?
What...? At least tell me.

1426
01:38:49,280 --> 01:38:50,280
Come with me, please.

1427
01:38:50,410 --> 01:38:52,010
Come on.
- What happened? Say something.

1428
01:38:52,230 --> 01:38:53,240
Bye, auntie.

1429
01:38:53,680 --> 01:38:54,910
Bye, uncle.

1430
01:38:56,320 --> 01:38:57,450
Bye, Sameer.

1431
01:38:57,620 --> 01:38:59,280
Hope to never see you again.

1432
01:39:13,780 --> 01:39:15,280
Why did they leave?

1433
01:39:15,620 --> 01:39:17,410
They didn't leave, papa.
I made them leave, papa.

1434
01:39:17,700 --> 01:39:20,030
What do you mean?
Why did you make them leave?

1435
01:39:20,400 --> 01:39:22,280
We were preparing
for your wedding, Praful!

1436
01:39:22,370 --> 01:39:23,370
I don't want to get married.

1437
01:39:23,540 --> 01:39:26,080
Why did you say yes to
him if you didn't want to get married?

1438
01:39:26,160 --> 01:39:28,080
Like I had said yes, I'm saying no!

1439
01:39:28,990 --> 01:39:30,280
Mohan!
- Papa!

1440
01:39:30,370 --> 01:39:31,910
No, don't!
- Praful!

1441
01:39:34,280 --> 01:39:35,660
You will raise your hand on me?

1442
01:39:35,910 --> 01:39:36,740
Come, hit me.

1443
01:39:37,420 --> 01:39:38,240
Do it.

1444
01:39:40,120 --> 01:39:42,530
Get out of my house. Now!

1445
01:39:42,660 --> 01:39:44,620
Praful! - Get out
of my house right now!

1446
01:39:45,160 --> 01:39:47,660
Praful! - Go!
It doesn't make any difference to me.

1447
01:39:49,330 --> 01:39:51,620
Praful...
- Let her go. I don't care!

1448
01:39:51,700 --> 01:39:53,370
Calm down, Mohan! - Get out!

1449
01:39:56,370 --> 01:40:01,120
"Pour down..."
- What are you doing, Praful?

1450
01:40:02,080 --> 01:40:02,820
What are you doing?

1451
01:40:02,900 --> 01:40:07,240
"Come and drench me."
- Why are you packing your bag?

1452
01:40:07,330 --> 01:40:08,990
Mohan?
She is leaving.

1453
01:40:09,070 --> 01:40:12,330
"Pour down..."

1454
01:40:12,410 --> 01:40:15,410
- Praful... Don't take
what your father said to your heart.

1455
01:40:15,490 --> 01:40:19,780
"Come and drench me."
- He only wants what's the best for you.

1456
01:40:33,390 --> 01:40:39,620
"Pour down..."

1457
01:40:40,890 --> 01:40:46,460
"Come and drench me."

1458
01:40:47,070 --> 01:40:52,300
"Pour down..."

1459
01:40:53,540 --> 01:40:59,120
"Come and drench me."

1460
01:41:18,280 --> 01:41:21,830
Hello, Salma? Can I ask for a favor?

1461
01:41:22,950 --> 01:41:25,910
Can I stay with you for tonight?
Just for tonight.

1462
01:41:27,240 --> 01:41:29,870
Okay thank you, thank you.

1463
01:41:58,590 --> 01:42:01,080
Hey, Lipstick Bandit!

1464
01:42:01,930 --> 01:42:04,450
I am coming to Vegas
with your money tomorrow.

1465
01:42:04,580 --> 01:42:07,450
I am waiting for you
with baited breath, my love!

1466
01:42:08,760 --> 01:42:10,830
I don't have a place to stay.
Can you...

1467
01:42:10,950 --> 01:42:12,530
Oh, I can arrange a new name,...

1468
01:42:13,400 --> 01:42:16,870
... a new place, a new identity...

1469
01:42:16,990 --> 01:42:19,990
How do you like the name... Shakira?

1470
01:42:30,130 --> 01:42:35,020
"By the sand on the shore..."

1471
01:42:36,450 --> 01:42:42,120
"Lie still my footprints."

1472
01:42:42,770 --> 01:42:48,720
"It caressed them and went away..."

1473
01:42:48,920 --> 01:42:53,920
"It gave a hug and then flowed away."

1474
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:57,280
"Your unhurried course..."

1475
01:42:57,360 --> 01:43:01,010
"Your minuscule stillness...

1476
01:43:01,700 --> 01:43:06,350
"You are...you are the one, my love."

1477
01:43:06,430 --> 01:43:09,330
"Oh wave, stay back."

1478
01:43:10,550 --> 01:43:13,070
"Stay back."

1479
01:43:13,790 --> 01:43:19,010
"Or let me drown myself in you."

1480
01:43:19,970 --> 01:43:23,030
"Stay back."

1481
01:43:23,110 --> 01:43:25,970
"Stay back, please."

1482
01:43:26,480 --> 01:43:32,080
"Or let me drown,
yes please let drown."

1483
01:43:55,200 --> 01:43:56,490
Yes? Can I help you?

1484
01:43:57,780 --> 01:43:58,950
Do we have an appointment?

1485
01:43:59,240 --> 01:44:00,040
Oh dear lord!

1486
01:44:01,450 --> 01:44:02,530
Oh, my God.

1487
01:44:02,780 --> 01:44:03,870
What are you doing?

1488
01:44:04,460 --> 01:44:05,450
You don't have to do this.

1489
01:44:05,530 --> 01:44:08,030
You just tell me
what I can do for you.

1490
01:44:09,080 --> 01:44:10,280
Do you remember me?

1491
01:44:12,280 --> 01:44:15,330
You said people like me don't borrow,
we steal.

1492
01:44:15,620 --> 01:44:17,700
So here I am to steal.
Move!

1493
01:44:18,720 --> 01:44:21,030
I'm sorry, if I said that.
That's not what I meant.

1494
01:44:24,160 --> 01:44:25,330
Take me to the cashier!

1495
01:44:31,490 --> 01:44:32,870
Nobody move!

1496
01:44:33,400 --> 01:44:35,080
Ask him to put all the money in this.

1497
01:44:38,370 --> 01:44:38,880
Hurry!

1498
01:44:51,370 --> 01:44:52,330
How much is this?

1499
01:44:53,160 --> 01:44:55,330
Around 90,000 dollars.
- Just give it to her.

1500
01:45:23,700 --> 01:45:24,620
Hello?

1501
01:45:24,950 --> 01:45:28,030
There is a transaction
in my account right now.

1502
01:45:28,280 --> 01:45:30,910
I want to reverse the transaction.
How to do it?

1503
01:45:34,830 --> 01:45:37,120
I... I cannot come to the bank. I...

1504
01:45:40,370 --> 01:45:41,870
I am not here on Monday!

1505
01:45:42,330 --> 01:45:44,160
No, he cannot...he can also not...

1506
01:45:50,740 --> 01:45:52,080
Hello? Praful?

1507
01:45:52,200 --> 01:45:54,780
You gave my account number to Sameer?

1508
01:45:55,530 --> 01:45:58,030
Yes.
Sameer had called up.

1509
01:45:58,370 --> 01:46:01,330
Your father asked him why
he needs your account number.

1510
01:46:01,910 --> 01:46:03,330
But he didn't say anything.

1511
01:46:03,410 --> 01:46:06,160
Why did you give him my account
number without my permission?

1512
01:46:06,370 --> 01:46:07,530
What's going on, Praful?

1513
01:46:07,660 --> 01:46:09,410
I just don't understand anything.

1514
01:46:10,200 --> 01:46:11,780
You are upset with your father, right?

1515
01:46:12,330 --> 01:46:13,740
Why are you upset with me?

1516
01:46:14,330 --> 01:46:16,740
Where are you?
- I'm leaving the city.

1517
01:46:17,080 --> 01:46:18,370
You're leaving?

1518
01:46:19,180 --> 01:46:21,330
Praful, you should have at least...

1519
01:46:22,450 --> 01:46:23,490
Praful?

1520
01:46:32,530 --> 01:46:34,410
I want to meet you right now!

1521
01:46:58,490 --> 01:47:00,580
You transferred 50,000
dollars into my account?

1522
01:47:01,280 --> 01:47:02,700
That was the money
meant for your studies, right?

1523
01:47:06,980 --> 01:47:08,030
What are you trying to do?

1524
01:47:08,160 --> 01:47:09,620
You think you're a saint?

1525
01:47:09,870 --> 01:47:12,120
I don't want any favors.

1526
01:47:12,470 --> 01:47:14,990
Favors are given when
someone expects something in return.

1527
01:47:16,910 --> 01:47:18,200
I don't expect anything in return.

1528
01:47:18,740 --> 01:47:20,450
And I am not trying to be a saint.

1529
01:47:21,490 --> 01:47:22,830
I did what I thought was right.

1530
01:47:23,080 --> 01:47:24,660
And you should do
what you think is right.

1531
01:47:29,700 --> 01:47:30,580
Sameer!

1532
01:47:39,890 --> 01:47:40,780
What are you doing?

1533
01:47:41,900 --> 01:47:43,160
You are a very nice guy.

1534
01:47:44,210 --> 01:47:46,160
Don't get involved
with a girl like me.

1535
01:47:46,370 --> 01:47:47,530
You will get into trouble.

1536
01:47:48,460 --> 01:47:50,080
I wish you all the best.

1537
01:47:50,740 --> 01:47:51,870
Have a nice life.

1538
01:47:55,720 --> 01:47:57,460
I think you should surrender.

1539
01:48:37,660 --> 01:48:38,660
What is it, mummy?

1540
01:48:38,780 --> 01:48:40,830
Where are you going?

1541
01:48:45,330 --> 01:48:47,450
Cat got your tongue now?

1542
01:48:51,870 --> 01:48:56,680
Apologizing to your family, to your
elders, will it make you any smaller?

1543
01:49:00,470 --> 01:49:04,140
- Praful...Praful, listen...!

1544
01:49:16,200 --> 01:49:18,130
She refuses to understand!

1545
01:49:34,370 --> 01:49:36,700
I had rejected her loan application.

1546
01:49:37,190 --> 01:49:38,780
She asked me if I remembered her.

1547
01:49:38,860 --> 01:49:40,620
And I... I couldn't place her.

1548
01:49:41,470 --> 01:49:45,120
Praful? - Then she said that
I suggested that she steal.

1549
01:49:46,330 --> 01:49:47,250
I'm just a bank employee.

1550
01:49:47,330 --> 01:49:49,780
We can't go distributing
money to everyone who asks for it.

1551
01:49:49,910 --> 01:49:51,910
There are rules.
- Yes, of course there are.

1552
01:49:52,030 --> 01:49:53,200
You've done nothing wrong.

1553
01:49:53,490 --> 01:49:55,080
Copy that.
Excuse me, ma'am.

1554
01:52:22,490 --> 01:52:24,450
Come on guys,
you didn't have to do it here.

1555
01:52:24,530 --> 01:52:26,120
I would've come to the station.

1556
01:52:27,090 --> 01:52:28,330
Everybody's watching.

1557
01:52:29,350 --> 01:52:31,490
Come on! Not so tight! This is...

1558
01:52:41,370 --> 01:52:42,370
Stop here.

1559
01:52:42,700 --> 01:52:43,870
On this side. Here.

1560
01:52:44,450 --> 01:52:45,530
Here?
- Yes.

1561
01:53:08,320 --> 01:53:09,280
Thank you.

1562
01:53:27,740 --> 01:53:29,870
Hello, police helpline?

1563
01:53:30,400 --> 01:53:32,030
No, no, no I don't need help.

1564
01:53:32,240 --> 01:53:33,330
I want to help you.

1565
01:53:33,450 --> 01:53:36,160
You are looking for Simran,
The Lipstick Bandit?

1566
01:53:52,450 --> 01:53:53,240
Don't shoot!

1567
01:53:53,330 --> 01:53:54,410
Are you Simran?

1568
01:53:55,710 --> 01:53:57,830
The Lipstick Bandit?
Are you Simran?

1569
01:53:58,660 --> 01:53:59,780
Keep your hands up.

1570
01:54:01,160 --> 01:54:02,200
Keep your hands up.

1571
01:54:03,830 --> 01:54:04,740
Are you strapped?

1572
01:54:04,870 --> 01:54:07,200
No, no.
- Do you have a weapon?

1573
01:54:07,530 --> 01:54:09,870
Yes.
- Okay slowly...

1574
01:54:10,120 --> 01:54:12,580
Slowly put the weapon on the ground.

1575
01:54:13,240 --> 01:54:14,280
On the ground.

1576
01:54:16,490 --> 01:54:17,700
Hands in the air.

1577
01:54:18,330 --> 01:54:19,200
Do not move.

1578
01:54:19,330 --> 01:54:20,370
Stand still.

1579
01:54:23,910 --> 01:54:24,950
Stand still.

1580
01:54:32,740 --> 01:54:33,870
You are the Lipstick Bandit?

1581
01:54:34,200 --> 01:54:35,200
Yes.

1582
01:54:35,360 --> 01:54:36,580
I have the money... - Stop.

1583
01:54:37,060 --> 01:54:38,200
Don't touch anything.

1584
01:54:41,080 --> 01:54:43,450
Why run if you are going to surrender?

1585
01:54:44,080 --> 01:54:46,490
Because that neighborhood
is full of Indians!

1586
01:54:46,860 --> 01:54:48,330
All my relatives live there.

1587
01:54:48,580 --> 01:54:51,490
If my father sees me getting arrested,
he will kill me.

1588
01:54:51,830 --> 01:54:54,120
Let's go or he will find us.

1589
01:54:55,700 --> 01:54:56,830
Are you serious?

1590
01:54:57,780 --> 01:54:58,700
Let's go.

1591
01:54:58,890 --> 01:54:59,780
Let's go.

1592
01:55:47,910 --> 01:55:50,030
Mummy, you should bring
more 'Dhokla' (snacks).

1593
01:55:50,410 --> 01:55:52,280
I'm keeping the 'Khakra'
(snacks) for my friends.

1594
01:55:53,080 --> 01:55:54,620
Eat to your heart's content, dear.

1595
01:55:55,360 --> 01:55:57,120
And what are these
friends have you made here?

1596
01:55:57,600 --> 01:55:59,200
You better stay away
from bad company.

1597
01:55:59,280 --> 01:56:02,120
Cool down. Calm down. Eat peacefully.

1598
01:56:02,830 --> 01:56:04,370
There are only four months left, dear.

1599
01:56:04,450 --> 01:56:05,530
You've already spent six months here.

1600
01:56:05,950 --> 01:56:07,200
These four months too shall pass.

1601
01:56:08,010 --> 01:56:11,620
When you get out of here,
forget the past and start afresh.

1602
01:56:12,120 --> 01:56:15,990
I have decided that you'll
be a partner in my business.

1603
01:56:16,410 --> 01:56:17,410
You should start working in the shop.

1604
01:56:17,780 --> 01:56:20,200
Anyway, what's mine is yours.

1605
01:56:20,280 --> 01:56:23,200
Papa, you don't have
to worry about anything.

1606
01:56:23,410 --> 01:56:25,160
I have planned everything.

1607
01:56:25,710 --> 01:56:26,910
You have become old.

1608
01:56:27,280 --> 01:56:31,410
We will sell your shop and
invest all your money in stocks.

1609
01:56:32,350 --> 01:56:33,950
I have made a friend, Sue.

1610
01:56:34,120 --> 01:56:36,870
Her bad luck that she got busted.

1611
01:56:37,240 --> 01:56:40,160
Mummy, I tell you,
she's a stock market genius.

1612
01:56:43,530 --> 01:56:44,450
What did you say?

1613
01:56:50,690 --> 01:56:52,480
I won't spare you!
- Mohan! Let her go!

1614
01:57:49,820 --> 01:57:52,840
Hi, I'm Maniben.

1615
01:57:53,610 --> 01:57:56,450
Hi, I'm Maniben.

1616
01:57:57,300 --> 01:57:58,860
Hi, I'm Maniben.

1617
01:57:58,940 --> 01:58:00,660
Shakuntala Kanta's
elder sister insane.

1618
01:58:00,740 --> 01:58:02,460
Get married said my dad...

1619
01:58:02,540 --> 01:58:04,380
Or your grandma will
be on the deathbed.

1620
01:58:04,460 --> 01:58:08,130
Get married. Get married. Get married.

1621
01:58:08,210 --> 01:58:10,320
Don't they have anything else to do?

1622
01:58:11,530 --> 01:58:13,110
Diwali's gone, Holi's here.

1623
01:58:13,190 --> 01:58:15,160
Diwali's gone, Holi's here.

1624
01:58:15,240 --> 01:58:18,950
Postpone my marriage,
I told my family here.

1625
01:58:19,030 --> 01:58:22,200
I want to stay single!
Let me stay single.

1626
01:58:22,280 --> 01:58:25,860
Papa, I want to stay single!
Let me stay single.

1627
01:58:25,940 --> 01:58:29,490
I'll make you Dhokla.
Let me stay single.

1628
01:58:29,570 --> 01:58:33,120
I'll make you tea. Let me stay single.

1629
01:58:36,570 --> 01:58:39,780
Fun-filled life!

1630
01:58:40,050 --> 01:58:42,610
Fun-filled life!

1631
01:58:43,770 --> 01:58:44,810
Fun-filled life!

1632
01:58:44,890 --> 01:58:47,860
Dance, cutie!

Fun-filled life!

1638
01:59:05,530 --> 01:59:09,900
You get multiple useless
proposals in a week.

1639
01:59:09,980 --> 01:59:13,570
Like cheaper by the
deal in a mall you seek.

1640
01:59:13,650 --> 01:59:17,190
In the end, you will find
a one in a million whacko for me.

1641
01:59:17,270 --> 01:59:20,700
Then without my consent,
you will get him married to me.

1642
01:59:20,780 --> 01:59:24,040
Forget it. Papa, forget it.

1643
01:59:24,760 --> 01:59:27,700
I am happy. Let me stay happy.

1644
01:59:28,100 --> 01:59:31,640
I want to stay single!
Let me stay single.

1645
01:59:31,790 --> 01:59:35,320

of a happy life with everyone!
