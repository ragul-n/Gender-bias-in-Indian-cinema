1
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,700
In the lives of the Karavali
(Coastal) people...

2
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,540
...their customs and
traditions are deep rooted.

3
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,040
When things happen
around these people,...

4
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:21,700
...what comes out are
mere perspectives,...

5
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:24,000
...and not reality.

6
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:28,660
Shadows follow us
only in the day.

7
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:33,540
But the only thing that follows us
irrespective of the boundaries,...

8
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,620
...is the Karma of our deeds.

9
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:40,660
It is believed that Man who
hates his own species,...

10
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:45,410
...and is full of selfish
motives, can only be corrected...

11
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:48,870
...only by the traditions
of this land, is...

12
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:53,080
...something that the people
here believe even today.

13
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:02,660
Drat !

14
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,290
Hmph !

15
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:21,660
Aye, clean up the place faster !
It's getting late !

16
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,370
Manja, turn off
the kitchen light.

17
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,200
Clean that table !

18
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,870
Namaskara, (Greetings) Sir !
- Yeah !

19
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,450
Bendy, close the shutter !

20
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:52,120
No matter how many times I call,
you dare not to pick my call !

21
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,790
You'll regret this !

22
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:58,040
I've spared you for too long.
Not anymore !

23
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,540
I'll teach you a lesson !

24
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:05,040
You better pay today, else
I will not take it anymore.

25
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:10,160
Damn you ! How many times
are you going to call me?

26
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,540
You don't even let me
drink in peace. Move it !

27
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,620
Yes, sir !

28
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:23,500
What the hell's with you?
- Sir, the thing is...

29
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:27,370
My wife's unwell. She needs to
go to the hospital immediately.

30
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,950
Umm.. Fine ! Let's go !

31
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:33,370
That son of a rogue is
avoiding my calls !

32
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,160
I badly need the cash.
And he's making merry !

33
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,580
Goddamn it ! Careful with
the vehicle. Are you drunk?

34
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,410
Apologies, sir !
- Hmph !

35
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,000
Looks like it'll rain.

36
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,040
Go faster !
- Sure, sir !

37
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,040
Why did you stop ?

38
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:05,330
Huh?

39
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:12,160
Argh !

40
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:15,120
Sir, a tree's blocking our way !

41
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:17,000
We can't move ahead !

42
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,790
What the hell man !

43
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,660
I won't be able to move it.
What do we do ?

44
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:28,910
Damn !

45
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,160
Sir, you can walk
this way, right?

46
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,830
Look at you trying to
act smart in my own town ?

47
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,040
You...

48
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:42,080
Do you have a torch?

49
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:53,250
Sir, it's late.
Please be careful !

50
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,580
Get going, smarty pants !

51
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,500
*ON PHONE*
Bhaskar, hear me out !

52
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,910
I've been telling you
that I'm not in town !

53
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:09,000
I'll repay you once
am back. Okay ?

54
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:11,410
Don't bug me repeatedly
with your calls.

55
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:13,950
Get it?
- I'm tired of this.

56
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:17,620
I've never asked you all these
years. But, I need the cash now !

57
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,540
So only, I'm asking.
You've had your chance.

58
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:24,540
Now that you don't need me,
you're not picking my calls.

59
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,790
I will not spare you ! Hello ?!

60
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,160
The network's acting cranky !

61
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,250
Who.. Who is it?

62
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:13,500
There's light in
Guttinamane at this hour.

63
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,200
Who's in there?

64
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:25,040
Hello?

65
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:25,200
Sir, we need to handle this
bungalow's matter carefully.

66
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,910
Remember Jayanth, who
cut the sandalwood tree?

67
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,160
He was found dead here !
And it wasn't just him.

68
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:35,160
Three more guys who came,
are nowhere to be found !

69
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,580
Cut it !

70
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:39,870
Don't blabber nonsense !
And call the ambulance !

71
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:46,790
Kiran ! Make a video recording
of all of this !

72
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,450
I can't see shit !

73
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:51,870
You will, if you open the cap !

74
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,040
Hey, you..
Move aside !

75
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:04,080
Move away !
And you.. come here !

76
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:07,950
Sir, he's the one who
saw the body first !

77
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:15,620
Sir, I found a watch here !
- Get it here !

78
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:19,870
Ramaiah, send this
watch to the laboratory !

79
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,830
Do we have any
witness of the incident?

80
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,830
No witnesses, but they all
have different stories to tell !

81
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:27,000
What are they?
- The same old ghost stories !

82
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:30,290
Send the body
for post-mortem.

83
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,790
It's been a month
since the death...

84
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:40,250
...of popular
politician, Bhaskar !

85
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,790
The police department has
failed to crack the case !

86
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:46,040
Let's hear what the local
minister has to say about it.

87
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,910
Look, Bhaskar Rai was an
honest politician in our party.

88
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:55,450
His death is an
unbearable loss to us !

89
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,120
I've personally discussed this
case with the Home Minister !

90
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:03,750
I can only comment further
after the investigation's done.

91
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:06,410
Could it be a case
of political vengeance ?

92
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:09,040
We'll find it out later !

93
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,250
Officer, it's been a month
since Mr. Bhaskar's death.

94
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:22,290
What is your department up to?
- Sir, we're investigating...

95
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,410
What are you investigating?

96
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:26,410
How many more
days do you want?

97
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:29,120
If you're not capable
of it, be clear.

98
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,120
I'll get the right
person to do it.

99
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,160
Bengaluru Crime Branch
Officer Karthik,...

100
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,370
...has already been
handed over the case.

101
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:37,870
You call whomever you want.

102
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:41,370
All I want are results !
- Yes, sir !

103
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:44,370
As the entire state
awaits the verdict of the...

104
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:47,250
...murder case of Journalist
Gayathri Pushkar,...

105
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:49,660
...the real culprits
have been sentenced.

106
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:53,870
Officer Karthik's efficient
investigation needs to be lauded !

107
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,540
*Calling out in unison*

108
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:00,370
Having handled this high
profile case like a super cop,...

109
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:03,040
...what do you have to
say about the verdict?

110
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,200
The real culprits have been
sentenced in this case.

111
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,040
And, I'm proud of our
efficient justice system.

112
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:13,580
Mr. Karthik, you're
a police officer.

113
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,660
You must be facing a lot
of pressure at work.

114
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:19,910
Have you ever felt that you're
forgetting your family, amidst work?

115
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:22,750
You have a wife, and
have you ever felt...

116
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:26,000
...the need to pay
attention to her?

117
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,250
Nothing of those sorts !

118
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,200
Sometimes we'll have to
manage multiple cases !

119
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:31,580
At times, we'll have to
work all day and night.

120
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:34,620
Good for you, Mr. Karthik
Kashyap ! Keep working !

121
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,200
*INTERVIEW CONTINUES*

122
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,250
Ugh !

123
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,500
He wants to work
all day and night !

124
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:40,870
*SARCASTIC REMARK*

125
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:49,750
And we have a worker here,
who's never here on time.

126
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:50,790
Drat !

127
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:12,370
Hello Atthe (Mother-in-law) !
- Tanvi, I've been trying to reach you.

128
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:15,910
You never receive my calls.
- Sorry, I was busy in the kitchen !

129
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:17,870
So only, I couldnâ€™t
answer your calls !

130
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,200
Does Karthik work
all the time?

131
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,080
Or does he
make time for you?

132
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:24,370
Well, you know
your son well !

133
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:28,370
Do you even plan to give
me some good news soon?

134
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:30,910
I get shouted at for
telling him anything.

135
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,830
I prefer to remain
silent instead.

136
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:35,870
Hmph ! - Looks like someone's
complaining my mother ?!

137
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,580
Hello, Mom !

138
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:40,750
Mother, I'll call you later !

139
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:42,910
I have some work
to finish. - Sure !

140
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,330
Good Morning, Sir !
- Morning !

141
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:49,370
I'm sure the Commissioner
has briefed you all...

142
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:51,950
...all about
Bhaskar Rai's case.

143
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,040
He did, Sir !

144
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,450
Make sure you report to the
Bramhavar station today.

145
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:16,160
Tanvi, did you
not add any sugar?

146
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,620
Oh, is there no sugar in it?

147
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:21,700
It isn't tasty then.
In the same way, Karthik...

148
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,000
Our life too...
- Come on !

149
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:25,660
Tanvi, this is no
time for philosophy !

150
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,830
I'm getting late.
I have to go now !

151
00:12:48,700 --> 00:13:04,750
Undeclared words remain in me.

152
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:09,250
And Iâ€™ve kept them
waiting just for you.

153
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:14,330
Pay heed to this call, my love.

154
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:20,290
For I shall share this
tale without a pause.

155
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:25,700
You are the messenger
of my desires.

156
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:30,660
Come unravel them
for Iâ€™m ready.

157
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:35,790
Be there to console me !

158
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:40,700
And relieve me
from my annoyance.

159
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:08,830
While this moment of
embrace with you,....

160
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:13,540
...is being remembered
by this grin.

161
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:21,250
Come tell me, how
do I not recall ?

162
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:26,540
In this walk through
memories,...

163
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:31,160
...I desire to see you.

164
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:36,660
Pay heed to this call, my love.

165
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:42,620
For I shall share this
tale without a pause.

166
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:47,660
You are the messenger
of my desires.

167
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:52,790
Come unravel them for Iâ€™m ready.

168
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:58,160
Be there to console me !

169
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:03,200
And relieve me
from my annoyance.

170
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:13,540
Life is a big zero without feelings !

171
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,750
Come on Tanvi. Just relax !

172
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:19,500
Everything takes time,
including our personal lives.

173
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,080
I get what you mean.

174
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:33,580
Why don't you
both take a break?

175
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:35,580
Everything will be alright !

176
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:38,450
God knows when
that's going to happen.

177
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:44,620
Madam, is Karthik Kashyap home?
- He's gone out of town.

178
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,830
What's the matter?

179
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:48,700
What is it? Tell me !

180
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:51,500
Nothing. I had to meet him.

181
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:05,750
Who was it?
- I have no idea.

182
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:09,160
He's been coming asking
for Karthik. - Strange.

183
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:15,700
Don't worry. Call me
if you need anything.

184
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,000
Okay. Bye !

185
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:27,950
Hello? - Namaskara sir.
Is this Karthik speaking ?

186
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,450
Yes, tell me.
- My name is David.

187
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,410
I had to discuss
something with you.

188
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:35,330
You've been trying to reach me.
Tell me. What's the matter?

189
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:37,830
I need to tell you something.

190
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:40,040
Tell me. What is it?

191
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,790
The thing is... - Just a minute.
I'm getting another call.

192
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:44,290
I'll call you back.

193
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,290
Any leads?

194
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:51,500
The case seems
interesting. Let us see !

195
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:55,660
Okay. The post-mortem report's out.
I've asked for it to be sent to you.

196
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,120
Another thing. No
match has been found...

197
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,330
...for the finger
prints in the evidence.

198
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:02,700
Please check our crime records.
- Okay, sir.

199
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:05,370
When are you coming here?
- I was there for two days.

200
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:08,620
Primary investigation's done.
By Friday I'll be reporting.

201
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,790
Okay. Another thing.
Head Constable Ramaiah...

202
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:14,000
...from our department
will be with you.

203
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:15,830
And one more request, sir.
- Tell me.

204
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:18,830
There's an old house
by the crime spot.

205
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,790
Can an arrangement be
made for us to stay there?

206
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:30,870
A call was on waiting !

207
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,290
*PHONE CONTINUES RINGING*

208
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,370
Master, please arrange the
bungalow at the earliest.

209
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:44,250
Sure Ramaiah,
I am on it now.

210
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:46,160
Don't break your head over this.

211
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,950
I'm here for you.
Okay, sure.

212
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,700
Namaskara (Greetings) Master !
- Namaskara !

213
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:55,870
The Landlord's here!

214
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,410
Namaskara
- Namaskara sir !

215
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,620
What's the matter?

216
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,450
On the 25th of this month,
we have...

217
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:10,370
...organised the annual
Yakshagana show.

218
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:12,290
Please grace the event along...

219
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:14,120
...with your family.
- Sure !

220
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:19,700
Are the preparations done?
- We're doing our best.

221
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:22,750
But,.. we're facing an issue.

222
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:24,870
What is it?
- Lord, someone's lodged...

223
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:27,250
...a complaint against
performing there.

224
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,540
Therefore, the officer
has told us that he...

225
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:31,500
can't provide the
necessary permission.

226
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:35,370
Officer, this is the
Lord Mahalingeshwara's...

227
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:37,700
...annual Yakshagana event.

228
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:40,080
And it's been a
tradition for years.

229
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:43,450
No law should obstruct
the people's faith.

230
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,950
Sir, the thing is...
- Inspector!

231
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,160
No more discuss
on this. Okay?

232
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,290
Sure, sir.
- Let the event take place.

233
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,620
Vicky..

234
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:57,330
Good luck with it.
- We're grateful, sir !

235
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:59,790
We shall take your leave now !
- Go ahead.

236
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,370
Mr. Krishnappa !
Didn't notice you.

237
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,000
Please, sit ! - Had been
to Mangaluru for a while.

238
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,830
Oh, is it?

239
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:13,120
What made you
come all this way?

240
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,000
Someone important
to me, is visiting...

241
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,660
...our town to purchase land.

242
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,580
They inquired about
a place to stay.

243
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,620
Our old bungalow's available.

244
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,660
What if we prep it up a bit?

245
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:27,250
You know all about
that old bungalow.

246
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:30,700
They're city dwellers. Why
would they believe in such stuff?

247
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,910
They're coming to buy land.

248
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,950
If our estate impresses them,...

249
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,250
...they might buy the
old bungalow too.

250
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:42,410
Well, if you insist.
Let them stay there.

251
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:45,700
The key to the bungalow's
been misplaced.

252
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,750
I'll get the new ones made.

253
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:49,870
I shall take your leave then.
- Sure!

254
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,870
Namaste madam. Is
Karthik Kashyap home?

255
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:02,830
I am his wife.
How can I help you?

256
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:04,120
There's a courier for him.

257
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:06,950
Please sign here.

258
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:11,500
Excuse me?
- Huh?

259
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,000
Why the delay today?
It's 12:30 P.M. already.

260
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,080
I got late only by ten minutes.
It's only 7:30 A.M. now.

261
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,200
Is it?

262
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:22,660
This woman knows
no concept of time !

263
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:24,290
Only 7:30 A.M.?

264
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:29,580
Hey, Tanvi.
I'm really sorry!

265
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,790
I was just fooling around.
What happened?

266
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:36,580
Are you okay?
- I'm not okay Karthik !

267
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:39,250
Sorry ! Hear me out, Tanvi.

268
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,750
I'm really sorry.

269
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,830
I was working all night.
Couldn't make it home.

270
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,660
Tell me, what happened?

271
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,790
Karthik,..
The thing is...

272
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:55,040
Last night...

273
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:09,660
Tanvi...?
- Nothing. I'll make some tea.

274
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,750
I've informed the Landlord
and have gotten things ready.

275
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:18,830
Few more days, and
everything will be alright.

276
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:20,040
Let that be.

277
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:24,700
What's the progress on
the Bhaskar Rai case?

278
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:26,910
You'll handle it, right?

279
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,910
It's become a nuisance!

280
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:30,870
There's no match
for the fingerprints.

281
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:34,120
We've no idea where to look
for it. - Here. Have it.

282
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:39,660
So.. The fingerprints
aren't matching ?!

283
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:42,080
How will it? When it
doesn't exist! - Huh?

284
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:46,750
There are four fresh bodies
lying in the town cemetery now.

285
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:48,870
Unearth them and try checking.

286
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:52,540
It might be the right match.
- Master ?!

287
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:56,290
Was the fingerprint
fine or inside out?

288
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:58,950
What are you saying, Master ?
- Listen to me!

289
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:01,870
What if the fingerprints
belong to the ghost?

290
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:04,370
It will be inside out.
- Master !

291
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:11,540
Tanvi, do you believe in ghosts?

292
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,250
Huh?

293
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:17,540
Why do you ask?

294
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:21,370
There's an interesting case here.

295
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:24,040
There's been a bizarre
murder in a forest.

296
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:27,410
The locals believe that a
ghost committed the murder.

297
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:29,450
In the meantime,
the culprit has...

298
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:31,700
...fooled everyone
and gotten away.

299
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:35,540
What a joke, right? People
believe in ghosts in today's time!

300
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:42,290
Tanvi? - So, you
don't think they exist?

301
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:44,080
Why else do
the locals believe it?

302
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,330
Hey, why are you
reacting this way?

303
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:50,410
Nobody in the department
has encountered them.

304
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,830
Don't worry about it.

305
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,540
We'll handle it.

306
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:54,750
You get some sleep.

307
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,580
Good night !

308
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,250
Huh?

309
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,200
Kar...

310
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,330
Karthik..!

311
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:02,370
Tanvi?

312
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:10,870
Tanvi.?!

313
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:14,370
Tanvi, what are
you doing here?

314
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:19,200
Karthik!
The win...

315
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:33,080
Tanvi, what happened?
- Karthik !

316
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,120
Clock...!

317
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,950
There's nothing over there.
- The TV...

318
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,450
Tanvi, come sit down.
- The window... !

319
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:44,330
Sit. Now calm down!
- Karthik...

320
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:47,330
There's nothing.
Calm down !

321
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:52,000
Karthik, I'm having nightmares !
- There's nothing. Relax !

322
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:55,160
You seem disturbed.
- But, the TV...?

323
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,620
All this is my fault.

324
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:00,540
I shouldn't have spoken
of the ghosts at night.

325
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:05,040
Calm down, Tanvi!

326
00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:09,160
Karthik, something's
wrong with me.

327
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,200
I really did see
something over there.

328
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:14,700
There's nothing.
- I saw something !

329
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:17,120
Tanvi, it's nothing.
Just relax.

330
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:26,620
Let's do one thing.
Meet Neeta tomorrow.

331
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:30,000
Share everything with
her. You'll feel better.

332
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,580
I'll also talk to her. Okay?

333
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:36,000
Try to get some sleep.
There's nothing to worry.

334
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:37,790
Let's go.

335
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,910
*ON PHONE*
I'll see. Sure

336
00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:43,370
Ya, don't worry.

337
00:33:58,660 --> 00:33:59,830
Tanvi?

338
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:02,290
Tanvi !
- Hmm?

339
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:04,870
Ummm.. Tell me something!

340
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,580
You've experienced this even
when Karthik was around, right?

341
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:10,330
Yes !

342
00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:13,200
If only he could spend
some time with me,...

343
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,450
...it's easier for me to
get back to normal.

344
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:18,580
Of course. His presence,
will make a difference.

345
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:28,000
Human psychology is such.
It always prefers a comfort zone.

346
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:31,290
And when we miss it, there
are chances of such incidents.

347
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:35,500
On top of that, you're alone
at home most of the times.

348
00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:37,290
This could be a reason.

349
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:39,750
I'm definitely missing
my comfort zone.

350
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,580
There's no doubt in that.

351
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,040
But,...!

352
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:47,200
Neeta, I've never seen
such disturbing visions all my life.

353
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,830
Why are they
appearing in my dreams?

354
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:53,330
There's no specific reason
for why we dream.

355
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:56,330
But, it's all just
random narratives...

356
00:34:56,370 --> 00:34:59,290
...of our subconscious memory.

357
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:01,370
You said that the clock
had stopped, right?

358
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:02,700
It was just an illusion.

359
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:07,290
Also, the books you've read,
the horror films you've seen...

360
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:10,200
...are all appearing in your dreams.

361
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,830
Also, you said something
about a milestone.

362
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:19,200
What was written on it?
- Umm....

363
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:22,790
Actually, I don't
remember it well.

364
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:27,870
It was something like...
Net...

365
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,500
Give me a second.
- Sure.

366
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:36,660
Hello?
- Tanvi, I spoke to Neeta.

367
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:39,160
She said that there's nothing
to worry. - Okay !

368
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:42,160
So, are you feeling better?
- I am feeling much better now.

369
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,540
I had to receive
certain important...

370
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:46,330
...documents from
the department.

371
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:49,290
Did you receive any courier?
- Courier ?!

372
00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:54,660
Tanvi?
- Karthik, I'll call you later.

373
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,200
Neeta, I have to
handle something...

374
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:58,830
... urgent. I'll
meet you tomorrow.

375
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:00,000
Yeah ! Sure !

376
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:36,500
How are you feeling now?

377
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:41,410
I just spoke to the doctor.
It's all 'cause of mental stress.

378
00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:43,660
Nothing to worry.
- Thank you so much, Neeta!

379
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:45,500
C'mon Karthik.
It's fine!

380
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:48,950
Take care, okay?
- Karthik !

381
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:56,450
I've been observing for
the last one week.

382
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:58,620
She's very disturbed.

383
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:01,790
She's facing minor depression.

384
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:04,660
If this state of mind
of hers continues...

385
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:07,000
Things might go bad.

386
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:08,700
Hope you understand.

387
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:12,450
She needs a change in her life.

388
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:15,580
Most importantly, you
should give her your time.

389
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:18,700
Yeah, I've noticed that.

390
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,790
Why don't you take her out?
Go somewhere.

391
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:24,290
Get relaxed !
Everything will be fine.

392
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:27,000
Don't worry, okay?
- I'll plan for a vacation immediately.

393
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,870
I'll take her out.
- Okay !

394
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,200
Thank you !

395
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:56,620
This closeness is soothingâ€¦

396
00:38:56,660 --> 00:39:03,370
How are you not
paying heed to it?

397
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:22,620
Shall I give my life to
this hand reaching out?

398
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:29,040
Should I direct this
rising affection to you?

399
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:35,080
Something remains to be saidâ€¦

400
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:41,250
Bestow your smile upon me !

401
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:48,410
Leave the piling up
bitterness aside !

402
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:54,450
This closeness is soothingâ€¦

403
00:39:54,500 --> 00:40:00,700
How are you not
paying heed to it?

404
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:26,750
In your path, I
shall be present.

405
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:31,200
As you look at me,
unwind on my shoulder...

406
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:36,200
...for a moment,
fellow companion.

407
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:42,120
For I eagerly wait to
shower my affection.

408
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:49,330
Ask away as this allure
remains thirsty.

409
00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:55,370
Something remains to be saidâ€¦

410
00:40:55,410 --> 00:41:01,950
Bestow your smile upon me !

411
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:08,370
Leave the piling up
bitterness aside !

412
00:41:08,370 --> 00:41:14,580
This closeness is soothingâ€¦

413
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:21,120
How are you not
paying heed to it?

414
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:43,160
I shall be the milestones
in your journey.

415
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:47,790
Wherever you go, forgive me.

416
00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:52,790
For I shall pull you closer.

417
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:59,540
Dear companion, I unknowingly
surrender to your company.

418
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:05,750
With you by me, the sun
too feels refreshing.

419
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:12,410
Something remains to be said...

420
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:18,830
Bestow your smile upon me !

421
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:25,500
Leave the piling up
bitterness aside !

422
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:01,370
You're Karthik, right?
- Yes. And you are?

423
00:44:01,410 --> 00:44:03,790
Didn't you recognise me?
The Master. Krishnappa***

424
00:44:03,830 --> 00:44:05,330
Didn't Ramaiah
tell you about me?

425
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:08,750
Oh, Krishnappa the Master.
He's told me about you.

426
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:10,120
Did you come by yourself?

427
00:44:11,410 --> 00:44:14,250
Tanvi, my wife.
- Namaste, madam!

428
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:19,500
Looks like she's the silent type.

429
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:23,290
I hope you didn't encounter
any wild animals on your way here.

430
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,830
Nothing of...
- Why will you?

431
00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:29,160
Our people have
hunted everything down.

432
00:44:29,290 --> 00:44:31,790
Nothing of those sorts.
Do you have the house key?

433
00:44:31,790 --> 00:44:34,580
Sir, the key !
- How do you have the key?

434
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:36,450
It's not of the house,
it's from the jeep.

435
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:39,080
Jeep? Oh yeah.
He's Gopal.

436
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:41,790
Namaste ! He's the
caretaker of the Lord's house.

437
00:44:41,790 --> 00:44:44,040
Sir, asked me to
handover the key to you.

438
00:44:45,790 --> 00:44:50,080
This jeep's damn good.
Must have been very expensive.

439
00:44:50,330 --> 00:44:54,290
Ah ! How about we zip
in the jeep to get the keys?

440
00:44:54,830 --> 00:44:56,910
You can take a look around.

441
00:44:57,330 --> 00:44:58,450
Shall we go?

442
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:00,330
Let's go.
- What about madam?

443
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:03,500
Tanvi, we're going to get the
key from the owner's house.

444
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:05,620
Will you come?
- You go ahead. I'll wait here.

445
00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:07,000
Okay.
- Sir, here !

446
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:10,160
*EXCITED NOISES*

447
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:13,830
Get in from
the back, Gopala.

448
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:09,910
Namaskara Lord !
- Oh, Master. Greetings !

449
00:46:09,950 --> 00:46:11,540
Look who's here.

450
00:46:12,410 --> 00:46:15,910
I'd told you about someone
visiting us to check out the place.

451
00:46:15,950 --> 00:46:17,790
He's the one.
- Namaste, sir.

452
00:46:17,790 --> 00:46:19,910
Namaste, Karthik !
Please be seated.

453
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:22,330
Veena, my wife.
- Namaste !

454
00:46:22,410 --> 00:46:25,500
And your family?
- My wife's by your old bungalow.

455
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:28,830
And my parents are in Mysuru.
We have our own business.

456
00:46:28,910 --> 00:46:30,080
Very good.

457
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,120
Ramesha ! Come here.
- I'm coming !

458
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,250
What happened with
the bungalow's key?

459
00:46:34,450 --> 00:46:36,750
It's with the key maker.
We'll have it by tomorrow.

460
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:38,200
Okay, you can leave.

461
00:46:38,290 --> 00:46:41,290
Master, make arrangements
elsewhere for tonight.

462
00:46:41,290 --> 00:46:43,580
I'll get the keys tomorrow.
- Okay, sir !

463
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:33,910
*SCREAMS IN FEAR*

464
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,790
Ghost ! There's a
ghost in the house !

465
00:47:40,870 --> 00:47:42,370
What? Let's go !

466
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:52,790
Go check what happened !

467
00:48:42,370 --> 00:48:43,410
Tanvi?

468
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:48,830
Where did you get this key?

469
00:48:54,450 --> 00:48:58,080
Did the lady break
the door open?

470
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:01,160
Where did she
get the keys from?

471
00:49:02,410 --> 00:49:04,200
Gopala?
- Master ?

472
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:06,790
Where did she
get this key from?

473
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:08,160
I have no idea !

474
00:49:12,410 --> 00:49:14,000
Ah, Mr. Karthikâ€™s here.

475
00:49:14,450 --> 00:49:18,000
Greetings, Karthik.
Prepare one for him.

476
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:22,370
Umm... Mr. Karthik...

477
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:25,830
Did madam mention
where she got the keys from?

478
00:49:29,290 --> 00:49:32,450
She received a courier at
home which had these keys.

479
00:49:32,830 --> 00:49:34,410
Courier?
- Yes !

480
00:49:35,330 --> 00:49:37,700
Who could have sent it?
- No idea !

481
00:49:38,410 --> 00:49:40,200
Fine ! We'll not know that.

482
00:49:40,410 --> 00:49:42,330
Look at the nature.

483
00:49:42,790 --> 00:49:44,700
It's a beautiful night.

484
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,290
This farm, and the
surrounding areas...

485
00:49:47,330 --> 00:49:50,160
...together constitute
20 acres of land.

486
00:49:50,290 --> 00:49:53,830
Master, recently a mysterious
murder took place nearby.

487
00:49:53,870 --> 00:49:55,660
Murder?
- Is that true?

488
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:01,870
Well... there goes
my commission.

489
00:50:01,910 --> 00:50:05,160
Let that go. A murder
did it happen.

490
00:50:05,330 --> 00:50:10,870
The locals however are
bluffing about the ghost.

491
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:12,950
You don't let it bother you.

492
00:50:13,330 --> 00:50:15,910
But why isn't Dharmanna
living in this house?

493
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:19,450
Dharmanna is an
important man in this village.

494
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:22,370
He owns over three
to four houses.

495
00:50:22,410 --> 00:50:24,410
He'll stay as he likes.

496
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:26,410
Oh, madam's here.

497
00:50:28,330 --> 00:50:31,500
Namaste madam.
She surely is the silent type.

498
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:36,330
It's a bit cold right?
We're in a forest after all.

499
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:38,450
It's not that cold either.

500
00:50:38,450 --> 00:50:41,080
Having lived in Bengaluru,
this weather feels better.

501
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:44,410
Speak of Bengaluru
and my blood boils.

502
00:50:44,450 --> 00:50:48,290
Who knows what awaits
Bengalureans in a decade from now?

503
00:50:49,950 --> 00:50:52,040
Oh, they're here.

504
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:56,910
Namaste sir.

505
00:50:57,830 --> 00:50:59,160
How come you're here?

506
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,120
Why? Should I
not have come?

507
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:03,500
Of course you can.
All these belong to you.

508
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:06,290
I was told about the
guests at the old bungalow.

509
00:51:06,330 --> 00:51:09,000
I came down to
check the arrangements.

510
00:51:09,410 --> 00:51:11,160
All set?
- Of course. When I'm here...

511
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:12,950
...nothing can
go wrong.

512
00:51:12,950 --> 00:51:14,370
He is Vikram Shetty.

513
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:16,580
Dharmanna's son.

514
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:19,790
He owns all of this.
This is Karthik.

515
00:51:19,830 --> 00:51:21,870
She is his wife.

516
00:51:21,910 --> 00:51:23,080
Namaste !

517
00:51:29,830 --> 00:51:32,500
Master.. I hope...

518
00:51:32,750 --> 00:51:36,040
The arrangements...
are done right?

519
00:51:38,910 --> 00:51:43,410
I've taken care of that.
Shettre, let's leave then.

520
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:46,580
Let's give them some privacy.

521
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:49,200
You go ahead.
We'll follow you.

522
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:02,120
How do you like the new place?
Are you happy?

523
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:05,580
It's nice Karthik.

524
00:52:06,830 --> 00:52:09,580
Thank you so much
for bringing me here.

525
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,620
Madam's looking beautiful
in this moment.

526
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:18,000
Ahan ! How come?

527
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:21,500
Inspector Karthik seems
to be in a romantic mood.

528
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:24,870
That's 'cause Karthik's wife
has filed a complaint on him.

529
00:52:24,870 --> 00:52:27,120
Is it?
Alleging what?

530
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:30,000
For roaming around
like an idiot, instead...

531
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:32,830
...of spending time
with his beautiful wife.

532
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,950
So how does he
plan to make up for it?

533
00:52:36,830 --> 00:52:37,870
Do you want to know?

534
00:52:45,410 --> 00:52:48,370
I'm happy after a
long time, Karthik.

535
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:49,910
Thanks to you.

536
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:53,120
Master, do you
believe in ghosts?

537
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:56,120
*SARCASTIC LAUGHTER*
I am a ghost myself.

538
00:52:58,620 --> 00:53:01,160
Gopala, come here.

539
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:06,410
The locals claim to see Amma's
(Madam's) ghost often.

540
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:08,950
They claim it right?
Have you seen it?

541
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,790
I haven't.
- Of course, you haven't.

542
00:53:10,790 --> 00:53:12,000
Duffer !

543
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:14,580
Shut your trap and walk
- Master?

544
00:53:14,830 --> 00:53:16,950
I can hear some noise
coming from over there.

545
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:20,120
What noise?
To hell with you !

546
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:24,450
Where did Gopala go?

547
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:27,910
Are you out
of your wits?

548
00:53:27,910 --> 00:53:30,500
Quit moving around.

549
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:31,620
Let's move !

550
00:53:31,790 --> 00:53:35,000
Never in my life will I
tread past this way again !

551
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:42,750
K... Karthik ! Who
are you? Let me go !

552
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:47,750
Karthik ! Who
are you guys?

553
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:20,040
Karthik, what happened?

554
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:22,290
Nothing !

555
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:44,000
What is this old
jewellery doing here?

556
00:54:49,330 --> 00:54:51,580
I've heard a lot
about the temple, Karthik.

557
00:54:53,870 --> 00:54:55,330
Give me a minute.

558
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:17,450
SIM card wrapper !

559
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:43,040
Karthik, do you
remember today's date?

560
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:44,450
20th February.
Why do you ask?

561
00:55:44,620 --> 00:55:45,950
No particular reason.

562
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:50,120
Can you take me to
the town for shopping?

563
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:51,830
You want to shop here?

564
00:55:51,910 --> 00:55:53,790
What now? Will you
take me or not?

565
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:55,500
Let's go !

566
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:04,370
Okay. Is she okay now?

567
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:06,830
Her health's
getting better right?

568
00:56:06,910 --> 00:56:08,660
Yes. I'm with her.

569
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:10,080
She's come
out to shop.

570
00:56:10,290 --> 00:56:13,660
Look. You're in a new place.
A village of all.

571
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,200
Don't say no
to what she wants.

572
00:56:16,330 --> 00:56:19,200
Keep this aside !
- Amma, I'm getting another call.

573
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:22,370
I'll call you back.
- Wait, when will you guys return?

574
00:56:22,410 --> 00:56:24,200
When will you..?

575
00:56:25,870 --> 00:56:28,250
It's been six months
since I've seen him.

576
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:30,700
He clearly has no
concern towards home.

577
00:56:31,250 --> 00:56:33,040
Wait right there. I'll come.
- Sure, sir.

578
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:35,500
This is nice. That one too.

579
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:38,580
Tanvi, I'll be back in a minute.
- Sure. Go ahead !

580
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:41,410
Where are you?
- Sir, I'm here by the circle.

581
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:43,250
Okay !

582
00:56:47,790 --> 00:56:49,290
Madam, take a
look at this one !

583
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:55,200
Pack it !

584
00:57:02,540 --> 00:57:05,410
Did you get all the documents?
- All of them are here !

585
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:08,500
This is Bhaskar Rai's
phone call records.

586
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:11,370
And these are
his bank statements.

587
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:15,450
Spot inspection needs to be
done today. - Sure sir.

588
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:17,750
Here's the thing.
You go ahead.

589
00:57:17,870 --> 00:57:20,750
I have an errand to run.
I'll come once I'm done with it.

590
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:27,250
Done with the shopping?
- Yep !

591
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:30,950
Ummm.. Karthik !

592
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:35,290
A person wearing a
muffler was following you.

593
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:39,410
Actually, he's come home
multiple times, in search of you.

594
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:42,450
Ummm.. Who was he ?!

595
00:57:42,910 --> 00:57:45,250
With a muffler?
- Yes !

596
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:53,870
Ha ! I forgot to shop for
some important stuff.

597
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:56,950
Go ahead if you need to.
I'll take a rickshaw back home.

598
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:58,750
Okay !

599
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:12,950
Ramaiah...

600
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:16,500
What was Bhaskar
Rai's social image like?

601
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:18,250
Nothing to speak of.

602
00:58:18,580 --> 00:58:21,250
He was a political goon.
What more can I say?

603
00:58:23,330 --> 00:58:24,870
Sir, I've found
a key over here.

604
00:58:33,330 --> 00:58:34,700
Ramaiah...

605
00:58:34,950 --> 00:58:37,330
If only your department
had done it's job right...

606
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:40,250
- Hmm? - Sir, this key could
belong to anyone, right?

607
00:58:43,370 --> 00:58:44,830
It's a clean murder case.

608
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,040
Ramaiah !

609
00:58:48,410 --> 00:58:52,370
This case is not as
complicated as you think it is.

610
00:58:53,330 --> 00:58:54,790
And then the
stories of ghosts...

611
00:58:56,580 --> 00:58:59,290
We don't intend to interfere
in such matters.

612
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:01,250
We've done as much as we could.

613
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:04,040
Some believe
in it, some don't.

614
00:59:05,790 --> 00:59:08,080
There's something about this place.

615
00:59:11,660 --> 00:59:13,370
Kishore?
- Yes, sir ?

616
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:15,790
Send this key to
the forensics...

617
00:59:15,910 --> 00:59:17,830
...and ask for the report.
- Okay, sir.

618
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,830
This bike's damn cool.

619
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:23,620
Looks like it's brand new.
Should try riding it once.

620
00:59:23,790 --> 00:59:27,830
It's thrilling to ride
a Bengaluru bike.

621
00:59:29,910 --> 00:59:32,000
Chuck this. Check that out.

622
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:34,700
That's a lot more cooler.
*INAUDIBLE CONVERSATION*

623
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:35,700
You...!

624
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:40,700
What a mess !

625
00:59:41,330 --> 00:59:44,370
Namaste, do you need any help?
- No need. Thank you !

626
00:59:44,410 --> 00:59:47,000
It's okay. You're our guest.
- It's okay. I don't need it.

627
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:49,410
Thanks for the offer.
- Dhanya madam, let me handle it.

628
00:59:49,410 --> 00:59:51,830
Gopala, take this
and keep it inside.

629
00:59:51,870 --> 00:59:53,950
My lord, we had to
be somewhere right?

630
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,870
But.. Err !
- The shops will close. Let's go!

631
00:59:56,870 --> 00:59:59,870
There's a lot to be done.
Let's get going !

632
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:01,250
Fine ! Let's go !

633
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:03,870
Let's go, my lord !
- Darn !

634
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:09,830
Ramaiah, call this SIM
company and inquire...

635
01:00:09,870 --> 01:00:12,660
...about the shop this
SIM was allotted to.

636
01:00:12,660 --> 01:00:13,700
Okay, sir !

637
01:00:30,830 --> 01:00:31,910
Namaste !
- Where's Tanvi?

638
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:35,450
Madam's inside. She asked
me to wait until you come.

639
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:39,700
Okay !
- Sir... Umm... !

640
01:00:44,870 --> 01:00:47,620
Here.
- I shall leave then.

641
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:50,660
Tanvi ?

642
01:00:58,790 --> 01:01:01,950
Tanvi? - I'll get dressed
up in two minutes.

643
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Okay !

644
01:01:12,910 --> 01:01:13,910
Tanvi ?

645
01:01:14,750 --> 01:01:16,160
Tanvi, how much
longer do you need?

646
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:19,870
And this power cut !
Where's the candle?

647
01:01:20,620 --> 01:01:22,120
Tanvi, can't you hear me ?

648
01:01:24,790 --> 01:01:25,790
Huh ?

649
01:01:32,620 --> 01:01:35,250
Tanvi ? Oh my God !

650
01:01:35,450 --> 01:01:38,750
Is it our wedding anniversary
today? I'm really sorry, Tanvi !

651
01:01:38,790 --> 01:01:41,120
I should have known when
you asked for the date today !

652
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:43,000
I had forgotten.

653
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:44,790
Tanvi ?

654
01:01:45,290 --> 01:01:46,580
Tanvi ?

655
01:01:49,750 --> 01:01:50,950
Tanvi ?

656
01:01:54,410 --> 01:01:55,450
Tanvi ?

657
01:01:58,330 --> 01:01:59,500
Tanvi ?

658
01:02:02,330 --> 01:02:03,410
Tanvi ?

659
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,160
Where did she go ?

660
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:09,250
Tanvi ?

661
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:26,450
Tanvi ?

662
01:02:49,580 --> 01:02:50,700
Anupama Shetty...

663
01:02:52,250 --> 01:02:54,290
1992 ?

664
01:02:55,580 --> 01:02:56,620
Tanvi ?

665
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,540
Who is it?

666
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:08,540
Tanvi ? Where are you?

667
01:03:08,540 --> 01:03:09,620
Tanvi ?

668
01:03:10,540 --> 01:03:11,750
Tanvi !

669
01:03:20,910 --> 01:03:21,910
Tanvi ?

670
01:03:57,410 --> 01:04:00,370
Tanvi ?

671
01:04:00,620 --> 01:04:02,200
What happened?
- What..?

672
01:04:02,580 --> 01:04:04,120
Wake up !

673
01:04:18,950 --> 01:04:20,330
Are you okay?

674
01:04:20,330 --> 01:04:22,370
Here !

675
01:04:29,250 --> 01:04:30,660
What happened?

676
01:04:31,370 --> 01:04:33,410
I don't know, Karthik.

677
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,080
Tanvi..

678
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:43,000
Where did you
get this Jewellery?

679
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:46,000
This.. ?

680
01:04:46,410 --> 01:04:48,910
I found some jewellery
lying in the drawer.

681
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:52,410
I thought this was a
gift for the anniversary.

682
01:04:53,080 --> 01:04:55,000
I don't know what
happened after that.

683
01:04:57,040 --> 01:04:58,250
Don't worry.

684
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:02,620
Must be 'cause of
wandering in the noon.

685
01:05:02,870 --> 01:05:04,040
You take rest.

686
01:06:14,580 --> 01:06:16,250
Karthik, please come !

687
01:06:18,370 --> 01:06:19,870
That's my first wife.

688
01:06:20,830 --> 01:06:23,200
She passed away a
few years after marriage.

689
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:25,750
Please sit down !

690
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:28,750
What's the reason
behind your visit?

691
01:06:28,950 --> 01:06:32,500
I've been looking at land for purchase.
Hadn't found anything impressive.

692
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:34,700
But your estate's beautiful.

693
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:36,830
I heard that you're
planning to sell it.

694
01:06:36,870 --> 01:06:38,370
Wanted to discuss about it.

695
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:40,410
How much are
you quoting sir?

696
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:42,830
About that...
Master's handling it.

697
01:06:42,950 --> 01:06:45,370
We can negotiate
around it. What say?

698
01:06:45,370 --> 01:06:46,660
Okay.
- Well...

699
01:06:46,700 --> 01:06:48,950
Did you like the bungalow
you're staying in?

700
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:52,540
Loved it. I shall discuss with
my wife and let you know.

701
01:06:52,580 --> 01:06:54,200
Anyways she makes all the decisions.

702
01:06:54,330 --> 01:06:56,120
You're right about that.

703
01:06:56,330 --> 01:06:59,250
Why are you being so rough
with it ? Give it here !

704
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:02,580
You've screwed the trigger !

705
01:07:03,830 --> 01:07:06,910
This is an old rifle. You won't
find their parts anymore

706
01:07:06,950 --> 01:07:09,500
He won't understand that.
Be gentle. Here.

707
01:07:09,540 --> 01:07:10,660
Yes, my lord !

708
01:07:12,830 --> 01:07:14,450
Some tea or coffee?

709
01:07:14,700 --> 01:07:15,790
Coffee !

710
01:07:15,830 --> 01:07:18,370
Coffee? Veena, get us
two cups of coffee !

711
01:07:21,250 --> 01:07:24,000
Hey, Rajshekhar !
My brother-in-law.

712
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:27,580
He's a lawyer.
- Hello, sir !

713
01:07:27,620 --> 01:07:30,330
This is Karthik. He's here to
take a look at the estate.

714
01:07:30,370 --> 01:07:32,750
He's staying at our bungalow.
- Oh, I see !

715
01:07:32,750 --> 01:07:35,580
Our estate is a
very good plot.

716
01:07:35,830 --> 01:07:40,410
And the bungalow you're
staying in? Is really old.

717
01:07:40,660 --> 01:07:42,540
You won't find a
bungalow like that anymore.

718
01:07:42,540 --> 01:07:44,540
Isn't it?
- You're right !

719
01:07:44,580 --> 01:07:46,660
There you go !
- Brother, when did you come?

720
01:07:46,700 --> 01:07:48,410
Just now !
- Let me get you some.

721
01:07:48,450 --> 01:07:49,700
Only half a cup please !

722
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:53,160
How's the Kola work going on?
- I'm coming right from there.

723
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:55,000
Oh is it?
- Yes. By the way.

724
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,410
Why did you allow
Santosh to take charge?

725
01:07:57,450 --> 01:07:59,450
He's a big fraud.
- Brother, here's your coffee !

726
01:07:59,450 --> 01:08:01,830
Let the event get over.
We'll take care of him !

727
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:04,910
Nothing to worry. Things will
be ready the day after.

728
01:08:05,620 --> 01:08:06,910
Have your coffee !

729
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:09,580
You're here at
the right time !

730
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:14,580
On the 23rd of this month,
we have the annual Daivakola !

731
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:17,500
It's a spectacle.
You should witness it !

732
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:22,200
Veena, give them an invite
for the Daivakola event.

733
01:08:22,250 --> 01:08:23,950
Sure, I'll get it.

734
01:08:26,330 --> 01:08:28,500
The thing is...

735
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:30,660
The kola (performance)
will be for the Panjurli God !

736
01:08:30,660 --> 01:08:33,370
It's a special event. There's
no way you would've seen it.

737
01:08:33,830 --> 01:08:36,660
Brother...
- Ah ! Give it here.

738
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,330
I'll be back in a minute.

739
01:08:39,790 --> 01:08:41,790
Please be there !

740
01:08:41,910 --> 01:08:43,660
I'll be there for sure !

741
01:08:43,870 --> 01:08:45,500
I shall take your leave then.

742
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:47,410
I'll let you know about
the land tomorrow.

743
01:08:47,410 --> 01:08:49,790
There's no reason
to hurry. Take your time.

744
01:08:50,410 --> 01:08:53,330
Okay sir.
- Namaste !

745
01:08:57,080 --> 01:08:58,950
He seems familiar to me.

746
01:09:21,870 --> 01:09:23,160
I've been observing you.

747
01:09:23,950 --> 01:09:25,450
Why are you following me?

748
01:09:26,370 --> 01:09:27,450
Who are you?

749
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:32,410
My name is David. I had to
discuss some things with you.

750
01:09:39,580 --> 01:09:40,700
Tell me. What is it?

751
01:09:40,830 --> 01:09:44,830
One doesn't have to be
a genius to solve a mystery.

752
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:49,620
All one needs is the knack of
finding clues from an event.

753
01:09:54,790 --> 01:09:55,830
Get in !

754
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:01,790
Where are you taking me?

755
01:10:01,910 --> 01:10:04,660
I'll tell you, sir.
It's just ten minutes away.

756
01:10:07,750 --> 01:10:10,290
You might not
know about me.

757
01:10:10,330 --> 01:10:13,620
But I know
you very well.

758
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:21,200
Come in !

759
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:25,370
Look who I've got here !
*IN KONKANI*

760
01:10:27,410 --> 01:10:29,330
Did Putta (Kid) come?

761
01:10:32,830 --> 01:10:33,870
Sit up !

762
01:10:39,910 --> 01:10:41,200
Putta ?

763
01:10:42,290 --> 01:10:44,000
Oh my God !

764
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:48,500
I have been waiting
to see you for years.

765
01:10:53,580 --> 01:10:55,250
I am Mary.

766
01:10:55,250 --> 01:10:57,620
I used to work
at Dharmanna's house.

767
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,870
Madam, was a gem of a person.

768
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:04,250
She used to treat
us very well.

769
01:11:04,700 --> 01:11:07,500
At first when I saw her,...

770
01:11:07,540 --> 01:11:10,080
She looked like a Goddess.

771
01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:17,870
On that day, Kola performance
was going on in the village.

772
01:11:18,160 --> 01:11:20,830
*HUMMING A LULLABY*
- Mary !

773
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:22,830
I'm coming.
- Mary !

774
01:11:24,330 --> 01:11:26,370
Here's the storeroom key.

775
01:11:26,450 --> 01:11:29,750
Today's the day of Daivakola right?
I'll be going with my husband.

776
01:11:29,750 --> 01:11:32,870
I'll be occupied. You take
whatever you need.

777
01:11:32,870 --> 01:11:35,370
Sure madam. - I need to
be ready when he comes.

778
01:11:35,410 --> 01:11:37,080
You give the baby
a bath and leave.

779
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:39,450
I'll take care of it.
You can get going.

780
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:45,120
I finished all the work
and left for home.

781
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:47,870
Only then did I
realise that the...

782
01:11:47,870 --> 01:11:50,790
...storeroom key
was with me.

783
01:11:51,410 --> 01:11:54,950
I went to return it.

784
01:12:05,660 --> 01:12:09,450
Madam? Sir ?!
Please wake up !

785
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:12,080
Oh God !

786
01:13:19,910 --> 01:13:22,290
Aye ! Mary !

787
01:13:22,290 --> 01:13:26,200
What happened?
- Madam ! Sir !...

788
01:13:27,830 --> 01:13:29,830
What are you doing
here at this hour?

789
01:13:29,870 --> 01:13:32,290
Leave that. Where had
you been at this hour?

790
01:13:32,290 --> 01:13:35,080
Whose child is this?
And why are you so worried?

791
01:13:41,330 --> 01:13:43,410
Please stay quietly !
- Go inside !

792
01:13:46,620 --> 01:13:48,290
I'm calling from
Dharmanna's house.

793
01:13:48,330 --> 01:13:50,540
Their maid has hit
Dharmanna's wife on her head...

794
01:13:50,540 --> 01:13:52,750
...and is running
away with their child.

795
01:13:52,790 --> 01:13:53,910
Please come fast !

796
01:13:53,950 --> 01:13:56,950
What? Dharmanna's maid has
attacked her and run away?

797
01:13:57,200 --> 01:13:58,250
Who is it ?

798
01:13:58,250 --> 01:14:00,160
What happened?
- Run David, run !

799
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:01,540
Constable, let's get them !

800
01:14:04,540 --> 01:14:08,500
Run that way !
David, run !

801
01:14:21,700 --> 01:14:24,410
Almighty God !

802
01:14:26,790 --> 01:14:29,830
You are that child, my son.

803
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,290
Yes !

804
01:14:31,950 --> 01:14:33,200
It's you.

805
01:14:33,910 --> 01:14:36,410
David !
The photo ?

806
01:14:42,040 --> 01:14:43,450
This is you.

807
01:14:44,830 --> 01:14:46,580
Dharmanna ?

808
01:14:47,330 --> 01:14:49,750
Madam !

809
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:58,000
When I picked you up
from there and ran...

810
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:01,450
...both of them
were lying dead.

811
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:04,830
And now, I see that
Landlord's alive.

812
01:15:05,250 --> 01:15:10,120
Something's fishy
about Madam's death.

813
01:15:11,330 --> 01:15:14,330
I handed you over to the Father
claiming you were an orphan.

814
01:15:14,450 --> 01:15:18,330
And in the morning, the
cops were looking for us.

815
01:15:18,660 --> 01:15:22,620
Without knowing what to do,
we left the village.

816
01:15:22,830 --> 01:15:26,620
For twenty five years,
we had gone into hiding.

817
01:15:26,660 --> 01:15:30,250
A few years ago,
when I came to Bramhavara.

818
01:15:30,660 --> 01:15:32,500
I saw Dharmanna's poster.

819
01:15:32,540 --> 01:15:36,000
When I inquired, I found
out that he was alive.

820
01:15:36,410 --> 01:15:38,450
I also learnt that
he'd married...

821
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:42,580
...Rajshekhar's sister
Veena, and had a son.

822
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,790
I came home and told
Mary about this.

823
01:15:46,250 --> 01:15:50,540
Us finding you
was the Lord's wish.

824
01:15:50,700 --> 01:15:52,830
Do something and
make sure that...

825
01:15:52,870 --> 01:15:55,120
...your mother's
soul rests in peace.

826
01:15:57,700 --> 01:15:59,370
I can't make
out if you're...

827
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:03,410
...telling the
truth or not.

828
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:06,950
But when I look
into your eyes,...

829
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:11,660
...you seem to have
suffered from a lot of grief.

830
01:16:13,080 --> 01:16:15,700
If you've really done
whatever you've said.

831
01:16:17,330 --> 01:16:20,120
I am eternally
grateful to your sacrifice.

832
01:16:27,370 --> 01:16:30,290
Mary ?
- Mother ?

833
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:34,040
Please give some water !

834
01:16:36,750 --> 01:16:39,040
Drink some, Mary !

835
01:16:45,790 --> 01:16:47,080
Mary !

836
01:16:47,580 --> 01:16:48,790
Mary ?

837
01:17:01,580 --> 01:17:03,580
I came here for a case.

838
01:17:05,370 --> 01:17:09,080
But now, the mysteries
are slowly unfolding.

839
01:17:10,250 --> 01:17:11,910
Which one's true,
which one's not...

840
01:17:13,080 --> 01:17:14,370
I can't tell the difference.

841
01:17:18,660 --> 01:17:20,290
It's getting very personal now.

842
01:17:47,870 --> 01:17:49,250
Ramaiah...

843
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,870
Get me the file of
Anupama Shetty...

844
01:17:51,910 --> 01:17:54,160
...murder of 1992 from
the records room.

845
01:17:54,160 --> 01:17:55,250
Okay, sir.

846
01:17:56,620 --> 01:17:58,000
Sir, I have a doubt.

847
01:17:58,200 --> 01:18:01,120
Is this in anyway related
to Bhaskar Rai's case?

848
01:18:01,160 --> 01:18:03,330
It might have all
started from here, Ramaiah.

849
01:18:06,370 --> 01:18:09,580
If Mary didn't commit
this murder, who did?

850
01:18:11,700 --> 01:18:13,580
This case was filed
by a Rajshekhar.

851
01:18:13,580 --> 01:18:14,620
Who is he?

852
01:18:14,660 --> 01:18:17,330
He's a senior lawyer
of this village.

853
01:18:17,330 --> 01:18:18,580
He has a good image.

854
01:18:18,620 --> 01:18:21,660
Isn't he Dharmaraj
Shetty's brother-in-law ?

855
01:18:21,700 --> 01:18:22,790
Yes, sir.

856
01:18:22,830 --> 01:18:24,910
He might know
something about this.

857
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:27,080
I'll meet him tomorrow.
- Okay, sir.

858
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:34,120
You've handled the
matter all this while.

859
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:35,750
Continue doing the same.

860
01:18:35,790 --> 01:18:37,540
Do what fits you right.

861
01:18:37,870 --> 01:18:39,120
But one thing.

862
01:18:39,160 --> 01:18:42,580
No matter what, my name
should stay free from this case.

863
01:18:42,580 --> 01:18:44,750
This is a matter of prestige.

864
01:18:59,410 --> 01:19:02,580
So,.. Did you guys
visit any new place?

865
01:19:02,830 --> 01:19:06,040
We're going to watch Kola tomorrow.
- Take him along !

866
01:19:06,410 --> 01:19:09,250
If he refuses to
come, tell me about it.

867
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:12,500
He might be a big officer.
But he's still my son.

868
01:19:12,540 --> 01:19:14,750
Also, he's
still scared of me.

869
01:19:14,790 --> 01:19:17,870
Look at you.
Like he's a kid.

870
01:19:17,910 --> 01:19:19,450
Does he stay home these days?

871
01:19:19,450 --> 01:19:22,330
He does. He works
from home too.

872
01:19:22,330 --> 01:19:24,250
But, it's better now.
- Okay then.

873
01:19:24,330 --> 01:19:27,120
If you want to share
something, feel free to.

874
01:19:27,160 --> 01:19:29,500
Don't keep it to yourself.
- Nothing of those sorts, aunty.

875
01:19:29,540 --> 01:19:31,450
I will tell you.
- Okay. I shall go now.

876
01:19:31,450 --> 01:19:34,080
Have some errands to run.
- Okay aunty. Bye.

877
01:19:35,790 --> 01:19:38,540
Tanvi, I'm getting late.
Where's the towel?

878
01:19:38,540 --> 01:19:40,700
It's over there. Karthik...

879
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:42,700
I have never seen Kola.

880
01:19:42,700 --> 01:19:44,370
It's happening tomorrow,
will you take me?

881
01:19:44,830 --> 01:19:45,870
Okay, sure.

882
01:19:46,540 --> 01:19:47,700
And then...

883
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:50,120
Is Madam not happy
with the time I'm...

884
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:52,750
...spending or should I
keep going like this?

885
01:19:53,620 --> 01:19:56,620
Quit your job then.
We'll know how much you love me.

886
01:19:56,950 --> 01:19:59,790
Okay. Let's quit our jobs
and join the temples?

887
01:20:00,370 --> 01:20:02,040
Karthik...

888
01:20:02,750 --> 01:20:04,910
Thank you so much.
I'm really happy.

889
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:06,450
I love you so much.

890
01:20:06,790 --> 01:20:09,750
Also, don't complain
Amma about this.

891
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:14,040
She'll torture me with
her forwards on life.

892
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:15,700
Okay. I won't.
- Good !

893
01:21:05,830 --> 01:21:07,290
Oh God !

894
01:21:11,790 --> 01:21:13,750
Hello?
- This is the old bungalow right?

895
01:21:13,750 --> 01:21:16,410
Yes, tell me.
- Your husband has met with an accident.

896
01:21:16,410 --> 01:21:18,500
Please come soon.
- What? An accident?

897
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:26,660
Now he's all right.
Nothing to worry.

898
01:21:27,950 --> 01:21:30,250
Please ask his parents to meet
me when they arrive. Okay?

899
01:21:30,290 --> 01:21:31,370
Thank you.

900
01:21:35,870 --> 01:21:37,120
How are you now?

901
01:21:38,410 --> 01:21:39,500
I'm better now.

902
01:21:42,660 --> 01:21:43,870
What exactly happened?

903
01:21:44,950 --> 01:21:46,120
Well...

904
01:21:49,750 --> 01:21:52,580
Here Vikram.
- I've taken Karthik's jacket too.

905
01:21:52,870 --> 01:21:55,790
No problem.
- My bike's not working.

906
01:21:55,790 --> 01:21:57,120
So only I asked for this bike.

907
01:21:57,200 --> 01:21:58,950
Not a problem.
- Is Karthik home?

908
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:00,790
He's getting ready.
- Okay.

909
01:22:00,830 --> 01:22:03,250
Thankfully the procession
came that way.

910
01:22:03,370 --> 01:22:04,660
Or else...

911
01:22:09,250 --> 01:22:10,370
Don't worry.

912
01:22:11,330 --> 01:22:12,410
Take rest.

913
01:22:13,700 --> 01:22:14,790
Karthik?

914
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:16,290
Thanks a lot.

915
01:22:17,120 --> 01:22:18,160
It's okay.

916
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:20,910
Vicky. What happened?
- Thanks a lot, Karthik.

917
01:22:21,330 --> 01:22:24,750
Is it hurting a lot?
- I am fine Amma.

918
01:22:24,870 --> 01:22:28,160
Calm down.
- Look, what's happened to my soon.

919
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:30,750
How did you fall?
Is it hurting a lot?

920
01:22:30,790 --> 01:22:31,950
What did the doctor say?

921
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:35,080
Look for clues at the
spot of the attack.

922
01:22:43,870 --> 01:22:45,250
Vicky wasn't the target.

923
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:51,080
Let's see.

924
01:22:53,950 --> 01:22:55,330
Mr. Rajshekhar.

925
01:22:57,290 --> 01:23:00,250
Come in !

926
01:23:03,080 --> 01:23:05,370
How come you're here?
- Should I not have come?

927
01:23:05,410 --> 01:23:06,870
Or were you
not expecting me?

928
01:23:07,450 --> 01:23:09,830
I was just kidding.

929
01:23:10,410 --> 01:23:13,950
How's your investigation going on?

930
01:23:15,410 --> 01:23:18,160
Investigation? How do
you know about it?

931
01:23:19,950 --> 01:23:22,950
You're Karthik from
Crime Branch. Am I correct?

932
01:23:25,160 --> 01:23:26,250
So,...

933
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:29,500
Now you know all about me.

934
01:23:30,500 --> 01:23:32,370
And the reason for
learning about me?

935
01:23:34,120 --> 01:23:36,370
I'm a criminal....
A criminal lawyer.

936
01:23:36,830 --> 01:23:40,290
It's a habit to learn about
new developments in the village.

937
01:23:41,250 --> 01:23:43,660
Is that all?

938
01:23:44,540 --> 01:23:46,410
No. There's another reason.

939
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,540
Bhaskar Rai was an acquaintance.

940
01:23:49,580 --> 01:23:53,080
In fact, we were
childhood friends.

941
01:23:53,080 --> 01:23:55,950
If you need any information
about him, do ask. I'll help you.

942
01:23:56,080 --> 01:23:58,330
So, you'll help me.
- For sure.

943
01:23:59,370 --> 01:24:01,290
Let me directly come to
the point, Rajshekhar.

944
01:24:01,580 --> 01:24:04,410
Go ahead. Ask !
- I'm not here for...

945
01:24:04,580 --> 01:24:06,540
...Bhaskar Rai's
murder case.

946
01:24:06,660 --> 01:24:11,410
I'm here to talk about the
25-year-old Anupama murder case.

947
01:24:16,580 --> 01:24:19,870
Subodh, why are you still here?
It's getting late. Leave.

948
01:24:19,950 --> 01:24:22,790
And also, find out
about the next date.

949
01:24:26,040 --> 01:24:28,000
Yeah, sorry.
So, you were telling ?

950
01:24:28,200 --> 01:24:31,410
Anupama case !
- Anupama case ?!

951
01:24:32,540 --> 01:24:35,370
Let me think..
Anupama Shetty.

952
01:24:36,700 --> 01:24:38,950
Guttinamane case right?
- Exactly.

953
01:24:39,250 --> 01:24:41,700
That case has been
closed for years, right?

954
01:24:41,830 --> 01:24:45,120
We both know that the
case hasn't ended, Rajshekhar.

955
01:24:45,870 --> 01:24:47,410
I'm here to complete it.

956
01:24:48,620 --> 01:24:51,620
You would have got all
the information if you'd...

957
01:24:51,620 --> 01:24:53,540
...gone to the police
station. Why didn't you?

958
01:24:53,580 --> 01:24:55,040
I'd been there, Rajshekhar.

959
01:24:55,250 --> 01:24:57,660
Since there's no
clarity in the file.

960
01:24:57,660 --> 01:24:59,870
I came to ask the one
who filed the FIR.

961
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:04,540
Okay !

962
01:25:05,080 --> 01:25:06,540
Come on. Take your seat.

963
01:25:14,370 --> 01:25:17,750
Yes. It was me, who
got the case filed.

964
01:25:18,620 --> 01:25:21,120
This happened
twenty five years ago.

965
01:25:21,910 --> 01:25:23,660
I still remember well.

966
01:25:24,540 --> 01:25:26,410
On that day, the village
was witnessing Kola.

967
01:25:28,700 --> 01:25:30,250
Look at God's play..

968
01:25:30,660 --> 01:25:34,080
While the God was being
worshipped in one place,...

969
01:25:34,410 --> 01:25:38,450
A catastrophe had taken
place in the Guttinamane.

970
01:25:39,250 --> 01:25:41,290
We were all supposed to
go to Kola together.

971
01:25:41,910 --> 01:25:45,830
I thought of taking Dharmanna
along and went by his house.

972
01:25:46,120 --> 01:25:47,620
Dharmanna !

973
01:25:48,120 --> 01:25:49,540
It's late. Let's leave.

974
01:25:49,910 --> 01:25:50,950
Huh ?!

975
01:26:05,580 --> 01:26:08,250
Dharmanna ?

976
01:26:09,700 --> 01:26:11,500
Who? Who is it?

977
01:26:29,700 --> 01:26:31,580
Huh ? Mary ?

978
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:42,410
Aye, Mary.
Mary, stop !

979
01:26:42,450 --> 01:26:44,200
Where are you
taking the baby?

980
01:26:44,910 --> 01:26:47,120
Rajshekhar !
- Dharmanna !

981
01:26:47,450 --> 01:26:50,200
Please help !

982
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:55,120
She took... baby !!

983
01:27:01,950 --> 01:27:03,620
Hello ? Inspector ?

984
01:27:03,660 --> 01:27:06,660
This is lawyer
Rajshekhar speaking !

985
01:27:06,790 --> 01:27:08,540
From Dharmanna's house...

986
01:27:08,580 --> 01:27:11,910
Their maid has hit
Dharmanna's wife on her head...

987
01:27:11,950 --> 01:27:13,700
...and is running
away with their child.

988
01:27:13,750 --> 01:27:16,700
Rajshekhara !
She's breathing. Come fast !

989
01:27:17,700 --> 01:27:20,250
By then Bhaskar
also came there.

990
01:27:20,910 --> 01:27:23,200
We took Anupama
to the hospital...

991
01:27:23,580 --> 01:27:25,290
...in Dharmanna's car.

992
01:27:25,790 --> 01:27:26,830
But...

993
01:27:27,540 --> 01:27:30,410
On our way there,
she breathed her last.

994
01:27:38,080 --> 01:27:39,330
After which.

995
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:44,000
We tried
hard to find...

996
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:47,290
...Mary and
the child.

997
01:27:49,700 --> 01:27:52,370
Police investigated everywhere.

998
01:27:53,410 --> 01:27:55,410
But it was of no use.

999
01:27:59,250 --> 01:28:00,660
Over time, the

1000
01:28:01,410 --> 01:28:03,000
...case was closed.

1001
01:28:04,830 --> 01:28:05,910
Also,...

1002
01:28:06,540 --> 01:28:08,080
Anupama's death...

1003
01:28:09,620 --> 01:28:12,500
...is still an unbearable
thought for me.

1004
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:19,250
Anyway, you have all the case
documents with you.

1005
01:28:19,500 --> 01:28:21,410
You'll understand
everything when you see it.

1006
01:28:25,620 --> 01:28:26,700
It was...

1007
01:28:27,250 --> 01:28:29,660
A very unfortunate incident.

1008
01:28:38,950 --> 01:28:40,290
Thanks Mr. Rajshekhar.

1009
01:28:41,200 --> 01:28:44,450
If I need any more information,
I'll contact you.

1010
01:29:00,700 --> 01:29:02,830
What happened sir?

1011
01:29:05,080 --> 01:29:06,750
I think...

1012
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:10,750
...they've misunderstood
Mary's intention to help.

1013
01:29:14,370 --> 01:29:15,410
Let's go !

1014
01:29:32,750 --> 01:29:33,790
Hello sir?

1015
01:29:33,830 --> 01:29:36,080
What's the progress in
Bhaskar Rai's murder case?

1016
01:29:36,120 --> 01:29:37,370
We're almost there, sir !

1017
01:29:37,660 --> 01:29:39,790
I'll prepare the
charge sheet within a week.

1018
01:29:39,790 --> 01:29:41,120
The commissioner had called.

1019
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:43,120
He's assigned another
important case for you.

1020
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:47,000
I'm handing over the Bhaskar
Rai case to another officer.

1021
01:29:47,200 --> 01:29:49,580
But the investigation
is in a crucial stage.

1022
01:29:49,830 --> 01:29:52,660
Give me four to five days,
and I'll complete the investigation.

1023
01:29:52,700 --> 01:29:56,910
No, Karthik. I've already instructed
the new officer to investigate.

1024
01:29:57,120 --> 01:29:58,410
But, sir...

1025
01:29:58,410 --> 01:30:00,450
Hand over all the
documents within 24 hours...

1026
01:30:00,500 --> 01:30:02,620
...and report to the
Commissioner in Bengaluru.

1027
01:30:09,160 --> 01:30:10,410
Damn it !

1028
01:30:20,700 --> 01:30:23,580
Sir, you seem to be
upset. What happened?

1029
01:30:28,370 --> 01:30:30,910
Sir, the fingerprints report
will be out tomorrow.

1030
01:30:31,080 --> 01:30:33,330
Ramaiah, leave me alone !

1031
01:30:34,410 --> 01:30:36,000
Sir, the thing is...
- Ramaiah !

1032
01:31:04,830 --> 01:31:11,410
O weeping visitor in
a ruinous fair...

1033
01:31:14,410 --> 01:31:21,410
Tears aren't new to
you, why fear then?

1034
01:31:22,950 --> 01:31:28,370
On a full moon
night, even the moon...

1035
01:31:28,410 --> 01:31:33,330
...sulks, unable
to find Mother earth.

1036
01:31:33,370 --> 01:31:37,950
Then why do you brood?

1037
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:42,200
In a gloomy town,...

1038
01:31:42,200 --> 01:31:46,830
...a tiny glow-worm
flutters in glee.

1039
01:31:46,870 --> 01:31:53,000
Then tell us O fool,
why do you slump?

1040
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:58,450
Keep moving ahead !

1041
01:32:34,580 --> 01:32:39,750
The light from the
mast, promises...

1042
01:32:39,750 --> 01:32:47,500
...to glow till
it dwindles down.

1043
01:32:47,540 --> 01:32:50,410
Such high aspirations !

1044
01:32:50,410 --> 01:32:55,040
Speak up O human,
what do you own ?

1045
01:32:55,040 --> 01:33:00,080
In death, you shall
proceed alone !

1046
01:33:00,120 --> 01:33:04,870
The fault isn't yours,
you lost soul !

1047
01:33:04,910 --> 01:33:09,450
Is it wrong to
see no way ahead ?

1048
01:33:09,500 --> 01:33:14,330
The fallen seed, is
sprouting again...

1049
01:33:14,370 --> 01:33:19,830
A life awaits you !

1050
01:33:19,870 --> 01:33:23,910
O voyager, stop not,
proceed further.

1051
01:33:23,910 --> 01:33:28,290
In a gloomy town,...

1052
01:33:28,330 --> 01:33:33,370
...a tiny glow-worm
flutters in glee.

1053
01:33:33,410 --> 01:33:38,660
Then tell us O fool,
why do you slump?

1054
01:33:38,660 --> 01:33:43,830
Keep moving ahead !

1055
01:33:51,790 --> 01:33:52,790
Karthik...

1056
01:33:53,290 --> 01:33:55,080
Why are you here instead
of coming home?

1057
01:33:55,120 --> 01:33:56,370
What happened?

1058
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:00,790
I'm very disturbed Tanvi !

1059
01:34:01,830 --> 01:34:04,250
So only, I came here
to be all by myself.

1060
01:34:04,330 --> 01:34:05,950
What happened Karthik?

1061
01:34:07,500 --> 01:34:08,790
Remember you were saying?

1062
01:34:09,410 --> 01:34:11,910
That someone used to come
to Bengaluru in search of me?

1063
01:34:11,910 --> 01:34:13,870
I met him !
- Huh?

1064
01:34:14,370 --> 01:34:17,080
His name's David !
- Who's he Karthik?

1065
01:34:17,410 --> 01:34:18,870
Why was he asking for you?

1066
01:34:19,410 --> 01:34:20,870
If I'm alive today,...

1067
01:34:21,620 --> 01:34:22,660
It's because of him !

1068
01:34:23,160 --> 01:34:24,950
You mentioned a
courier that came home !

1069
01:34:25,370 --> 01:34:29,910
The courier contained a letter
which explained everything.

1070
01:34:30,660 --> 01:34:33,410
The ones in Mysuru
are my foster parents.

1071
01:34:35,620 --> 01:34:37,000
My real father is...

1072
01:34:37,500 --> 01:34:39,080
...the owner of
this village's ****

1073
01:34:40,370 --> 01:34:42,450
Dharmaraj Shetty !
- What ?!

1074
01:34:42,620 --> 01:34:45,290
What are you even saying?
Dharmaraj Shetty ?!

1075
01:34:45,660 --> 01:34:48,950
Twenty five years ago,
my mother was murdered.

1076
01:34:49,660 --> 01:34:51,000
I was saved...

1077
01:34:51,450 --> 01:34:53,370
...by this very David and Mary !

1078
01:34:54,700 --> 01:34:57,540
I am completely lost, Tanvi !
- Karthik !

1079
01:34:59,580 --> 01:35:01,620
My mother was unfortunately murdered !

1080
01:35:03,620 --> 01:35:06,910
There are a lot of things
that makes no sense to me !

1081
01:35:07,660 --> 01:35:08,950
The Commissioner had called !

1082
01:35:09,750 --> 01:35:11,950
We might have to return
to Bengaluru tomorrow !

1083
01:35:13,500 --> 01:35:15,700
Tanvi, who killed my mother?

1084
01:35:16,830 --> 01:35:19,910
Who's behind all of this?
I am not able to figure it out !

1085
01:35:20,040 --> 01:35:22,120
Karthik, even I am mixed up !

1086
01:35:22,750 --> 01:35:24,120
The key that came home !

1087
01:35:25,290 --> 01:35:28,000
And the bizarre experiences
that followed !

1088
01:35:28,410 --> 01:35:30,540
The events that are
happening in front of us !

1089
01:35:30,870 --> 01:35:33,580
Somebody's trying to
communicate with us !

1090
01:35:35,330 --> 01:35:36,950
My heart's telling me !

1091
01:35:37,080 --> 01:35:39,580
Some kind of force bought
us all the way here.

1092
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,410
The very force, will
provide us...

1093
01:35:42,700 --> 01:35:44,790
...with answers
for the questions...

1094
01:35:44,790 --> 01:35:46,750
...that is haunting us !

1095
01:35:47,700 --> 01:35:48,790
Don't worry !

1096
01:35:49,040 --> 01:35:51,040
I hope everything
will be alright.

1097
01:35:51,080 --> 01:35:52,870
You have to be strong Karthik !

1098
01:35:54,450 --> 01:35:55,750
Love you !

1099
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:19,870
Today is the day of Daivakola.

1100
01:36:20,120 --> 01:36:23,000
It's been twenty five
years since I've lost you.

1101
01:36:23,330 --> 01:36:26,250
As time goes, the
memory of you and...

1102
01:36:26,250 --> 01:36:29,500
...the baby continues
to haunt me !

1103
01:36:43,910 --> 01:36:45,290
Where did you find this?

1104
01:36:47,830 --> 01:36:49,200
In this old bungalow !

1105
01:36:52,290 --> 01:36:53,660
How did it come here?

1106
01:36:53,830 --> 01:36:55,750
Didn't expect this
question from the one...

1107
01:36:55,750 --> 01:36:57,830
...who's supposed to
answer everything !

1108
01:36:57,950 --> 01:37:01,450
I don't need to answer
anything to the cops !

1109
01:37:01,750 --> 01:37:04,040
I'm not asking you as a cop...

1110
01:37:04,620 --> 01:37:06,080
...but as a son !

1111
01:37:11,950 --> 01:37:13,040
This...

1112
01:37:13,580 --> 01:37:14,790
...belongs to my mother !

1113
01:37:24,830 --> 01:37:26,870
The child that Mary took away...

1114
01:37:27,160 --> 01:37:28,250
...was me !

1115
01:37:30,660 --> 01:37:32,750
You never tried
to find the child !

1116
01:37:34,790 --> 01:37:38,080
Before Mary died, she told
me everything she knew !

1117
01:37:40,620 --> 01:37:42,120
I want to know the truth,...

1118
01:37:42,790 --> 01:37:44,120
...that you know !

1119
01:39:05,120 --> 01:39:06,790
It was the day of Kola !

1120
01:39:07,120 --> 01:39:09,870
I'd promised to take
her to the Kola !

1121
01:39:10,950 --> 01:39:14,370
I got home late
for some reason !

1122
01:39:15,080 --> 01:39:17,290
Why are you late?
Where are you coming from?

1123
01:39:17,830 --> 01:39:19,500
I had some work to
finish on the way !

1124
01:39:19,790 --> 01:39:22,250
I very well know where
you're coming from !

1125
01:39:25,790 --> 01:39:29,160
Rajshekhar called me to inform
about this 'work' of yours !

1126
01:39:30,910 --> 01:39:32,750
Don't believe
Rajshekhar's words !

1127
01:39:32,910 --> 01:39:35,250
He blabbers randomly !

1128
01:39:35,620 --> 01:39:38,120
You're guilty yet
you dare to lie !

1129
01:39:38,410 --> 01:39:41,950
When I, your rightful
wife is right here,...

1130
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,910
...how low could you get to
sleep with another woman?

1131
01:39:44,910 --> 01:39:46,040
Anu !

1132
01:39:46,330 --> 01:39:47,620
Shut your mouth !

1133
01:39:50,080 --> 01:39:51,330
Stop right there !

1134
01:39:53,410 --> 01:39:56,750
Have you satisfied your passion
or do you still want more?

1135
01:40:32,370 --> 01:40:33,450
Madam !

1136
01:40:46,830 --> 01:40:48,950
I'd done the worst already !

1137
01:40:50,660 --> 01:40:53,250
I'll get the vehicle
started, come quickly !

1138
01:40:53,410 --> 01:40:55,000
Anu !

1139
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:00,000
Rajshekhara, get in quick !
- Start the car !

1140
01:41:00,950 --> 01:41:03,750
Rajshekhara, Anu ?
- It's okay. Get going now !

1141
01:41:16,700 --> 01:41:20,620
But on our way to the hospital,
Anu breathed her last !

1142
01:41:22,080 --> 01:41:24,750
Rajshekhar hid my
mistake, and...

1143
01:41:24,750 --> 01:41:27,120
...saved my face in the village.

1144
01:41:28,580 --> 01:41:31,250
Whenever I think
of Anu, the guilt...

1145
01:41:31,290 --> 01:41:34,450
...of having killed
her haunts me !

1146
01:41:38,700 --> 01:41:40,450
Nothing can beat
the punishment...

1147
01:41:40,450 --> 01:41:42,620
...of having to
tell my own son...

1148
01:41:44,160 --> 01:41:45,580
...that I killed his mother.

1149
01:41:46,080 --> 01:41:49,830
Forget that I'm your
father, and do what a...

1150
01:41:49,870 --> 01:41:53,700
...rightful police officer
would do as per law.

1151
01:41:53,830 --> 01:41:54,910
I made it clear...

1152
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,660
...that I'm not here as
a cop but as a son !

1153
01:41:58,950 --> 01:42:01,700
I... I learnt whatever
I wanted to !

1154
01:42:02,450 --> 01:42:04,950
The law will take the
next course of action !

1155
01:42:05,450 --> 01:42:06,540
But..

1156
01:42:06,750 --> 01:42:07,830
Here's one thing !

1157
01:42:08,750 --> 01:42:11,000
The fact that you're
my father and I'm...

1158
01:42:11,040 --> 01:42:13,540
...your son, should
remain between us !

1159
01:43:12,910 --> 01:43:14,080
Ramaiah...

1160
01:43:14,580 --> 01:43:18,370
Where's the local government hospital?
- Right here in Bramhavara circle.

1161
01:43:34,290 --> 01:43:37,450
Tell me sir !
- I'm Karthik Kashyap, from CCB !

1162
01:43:37,450 --> 01:43:40,410
Yes sir?
- Is there a Dr. Sudhakar Rao here?

1163
01:43:40,500 --> 01:43:42,080
I had to meet him.

1164
01:43:42,750 --> 01:43:46,620
There's no one by that name.
- Err.. Please check.

1165
01:43:52,950 --> 01:43:55,120
No sir. There's no
one by that name.

1166
01:43:55,450 --> 01:43:56,830
Ramaiah !

1167
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,040
Okay.

1168
01:44:02,750 --> 01:44:05,080
We have the address
of this hospital.

1169
01:44:05,250 --> 01:44:07,040
Okay. Wait here for a minute.

1170
01:44:07,540 --> 01:44:09,200
Sir, have you seen the
one in this photo?

1171
01:44:14,620 --> 01:44:16,620
Dr. Sudhakar Rao...

1172
01:44:17,540 --> 01:44:20,120
Actually, he's been retired...

1173
01:44:21,870 --> 01:44:23,410
...for nine years.

1174
01:44:24,910 --> 01:44:28,120
Do you have his address?
- Let me check.

1175
01:44:34,290 --> 01:44:36,700
Thanks a lot. Here !
See you.

1176
01:45:06,790 --> 01:45:07,790
Huh?

1177
01:45:38,330 --> 01:45:40,620
Speak up you crook !

1178
01:45:40,620 --> 01:45:42,790
I will sir !
- Answer !

1179
01:45:42,830 --> 01:45:45,000
I will sir...

1180
01:45:51,700 --> 01:45:54,450
Tell me Kishore. - Driver Shankar
has been apprehended, sir !

1181
01:45:54,500 --> 01:45:56,500
We got it all from him.
Hear it from him.

1182
01:45:58,370 --> 01:45:59,660
Answer him !

1183
01:46:00,200 --> 01:46:01,540
Speak up now !

1184
01:46:04,370 --> 01:46:06,410
Sir, I'll tell you everything.

1185
01:46:07,700 --> 01:46:09,910
Sir,... On that day !

1186
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,330
Ramaiah, give me the file !

1187
01:46:45,040 --> 01:46:47,790
Who is it ?
- Dr. Sudhakar Rao?

1188
01:46:47,830 --> 01:46:50,160
I'm Karthik from Crime Branch !

1189
01:46:50,290 --> 01:46:52,290
Oh, please come in.

1190
01:46:53,200 --> 01:46:55,200
Tell me, how can I help you?

1191
01:46:57,750 --> 01:47:00,160
Didn't you prepare
this Post-mortem report?

1192
01:47:03,910 --> 01:47:05,370
It's an old case !

1193
01:47:23,500 --> 01:47:25,040
It took this long...

1194
01:47:25,500 --> 01:47:27,660
...for this file to
come back to me.

1195
01:47:27,830 --> 01:47:30,910
This was the only mistake
I made in my career !

1196
01:47:51,200 --> 01:47:52,830
Ramaiah !
- Sir ?

1197
01:47:53,700 --> 01:47:56,910
Arrange a meeting in
Dharmaraj Shetty's house !

1198
01:47:57,660 --> 01:48:01,160
Also, follow the rest of
the department procedure.

1199
01:48:02,290 --> 01:48:06,080
One last thing. Ask the local
officer to come by the spot.

1200
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,910
Anu, I'll go out for a while.
- Dear !

1201
01:48:39,250 --> 01:48:41,500
Don't be late this time.
We couldn't catch the..

1202
01:48:41,540 --> 01:48:44,000
...entire Kola performance
last time either.

1203
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:45,910
Be home early.
- Okay. I will.

1204
01:48:45,950 --> 01:48:47,790
Take care of yourself.
- I will.

1205
01:48:55,250 --> 01:48:57,000
Hello?
- This is Karthik here !

1206
01:48:57,160 --> 01:48:59,120
Tell me, Karthik !
- Mom's murder...

1207
01:49:01,410 --> 01:49:02,870
Sorry !

1208
01:49:04,750 --> 01:49:07,410
There's more
to Anupama's murder.

1209
01:49:07,700 --> 01:49:09,950
I had to discuss it with you.
- Murder?

1210
01:49:10,660 --> 01:49:12,200
What are you saying?

1211
01:49:16,540 --> 01:49:19,500
*INAUDIBLE CONVERSATION?*

1212
01:49:20,580 --> 01:49:22,950
*INAUDIBLE CONVERSATION?*

1213
01:49:29,290 --> 01:49:33,330
*MUFFLED CONVERSATION?*

1214
01:49:33,450 --> 01:49:35,080
Veena ?
- Huh ?

1215
01:49:35,660 --> 01:49:37,080
Let's go to the house.

1216
01:49:47,700 --> 01:49:50,000
A meeting's been arranged
at Dharmanna's house.

1217
01:49:50,500 --> 01:49:52,580
Good !
- Sir, I think you've learnt...

1218
01:49:52,620 --> 01:49:54,870
...about Bhaskar Rai's murderer.

1219
01:49:55,080 --> 01:49:57,450
Who was it, sir ?
- What happened?

1220
01:49:57,450 --> 01:50:00,040
Why did you call me ?
Did I do anything wrong ?

1221
01:50:00,580 --> 01:50:02,370
Have you hidden
anything from me ?

1222
01:50:02,410 --> 01:50:04,250
Has anyone told anything
wrong about me ?

1223
01:50:05,830 --> 01:50:07,700
Answer the question first !

1224
01:50:08,120 --> 01:50:09,950
It was I who committed the murder !

1225
01:50:12,700 --> 01:50:14,910
Every murder has a motive
behind it, Ramaiah !

1226
01:50:15,500 --> 01:50:16,750
This one too.

1227
01:50:17,290 --> 01:50:19,160
This murder has no ghost behind it.

1228
01:50:19,370 --> 01:50:21,580
This murder was committed
by Veena Shetty !

1229
01:50:21,620 --> 01:50:23,040
What are you saying?

1230
01:50:24,790 --> 01:50:26,040
Yes !

1231
01:50:27,410 --> 01:50:29,950
It was I who killed Bhaskar !

1232
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:31,540
Bhaskar's murder?

1233
01:50:31,580 --> 01:50:34,830
He was constantly
calling brother and...

1234
01:50:34,870 --> 01:50:37,950
...threatening him to
ruin your name.

1235
01:50:38,950 --> 01:50:41,410
Without knowing what to do...

1236
01:50:41,500 --> 01:50:43,540
Veena Shetty took
the driver's help.

1237
01:50:43,580 --> 01:50:45,790
I don't know if you've observed...

1238
01:50:45,830 --> 01:50:49,250
The tree didn't fall 'cause of
the wind, it was brought down.

1239
01:50:51,290 --> 01:50:53,160
On that day, you weren't home...

1240
01:50:54,120 --> 01:50:58,330
You'd been to Bengaluru. I
wore her saree that night...

1241
01:50:58,660 --> 01:51:00,950
...and took the bungalow's key.

1242
01:51:05,660 --> 01:51:08,250
Veena goofed up,
by leaving the...

1243
01:51:08,290 --> 01:51:11,290
...wrapper of the SIM
in the old house.

1244
01:51:11,660 --> 01:51:14,500
When the number was tracked,
the driver got caught.

1245
01:51:14,500 --> 01:51:17,080
I called up Bhaskar
and threatened him.

1246
01:51:30,910 --> 01:51:34,200
And then, I wore
Anupama's jewellery.

1247
01:51:35,950 --> 01:51:39,500
After dropping Bhaskar in the auto,
he didn't return to the town.

1248
01:51:39,500 --> 01:51:42,040
Instead, he followed Bhaskar.

1249
01:51:42,370 --> 01:51:46,290
When he saw me dressed up like
Anupama, Bhaskar got scared.

1250
01:51:47,500 --> 01:51:49,330
Right then...

1251
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,750
....Shankara struck
him on his head.

1252
01:51:54,290 --> 01:51:57,410
They planed it accordingly
and killed Bhaskar.

1253
01:52:07,120 --> 01:52:11,000
To make it seem like
a ghost did it,...

1254
01:52:12,080 --> 01:52:14,870
...we put him near the
old bungalow's door.

1255
01:52:21,830 --> 01:52:24,910
That was when Veena's fingerprints
fell on Bhaskar's watch.

1256
01:52:24,950 --> 01:52:26,910
In a hurry to leave, they
wrapped the jewellery..

1257
01:52:26,950 --> 01:52:28,950
...in a cloth and left
it in the cupboard.

1258
01:52:38,580 --> 01:52:40,660
I found the key when I
was inspecting the spot.

1259
01:52:41,250 --> 01:52:42,540
That's when I doubted...

1260
01:52:42,870 --> 01:52:45,950
...that Dharmanna's house
is related to this murder.

1261
01:52:46,290 --> 01:52:48,330
I had to ask you something.
- Sure. Go ahead.

1262
01:52:49,160 --> 01:52:52,370
Do you know where the
location on this mobile is ?

1263
01:52:52,410 --> 01:52:53,790
Give me a minute.

1264
01:52:57,910 --> 01:53:02,200
This is by the market. Ask anyone
there and they'll guide you.

1265
01:53:02,200 --> 01:53:04,120
Thank you.

1266
01:53:06,750 --> 01:53:08,580
Ramaiah, send this
to the lab and...

1267
01:53:08,580 --> 01:53:10,580
...get the fingerprint
reports done.

1268
01:53:10,620 --> 01:53:13,580
Okay sir. - The hair found
during the investigation...

1269
01:53:13,910 --> 01:53:15,120
Fingerprints..

1270
01:53:15,500 --> 01:53:16,950
Call records...

1271
01:53:17,870 --> 01:53:20,660
Confirm that Veena Shetty
committed this murder.

1272
01:53:21,160 --> 01:53:24,620
Why did she do this?
- To save your reputation...

1273
01:53:25,120 --> 01:53:27,080
...I committed this mistake.

1274
01:53:27,540 --> 01:53:31,200
The inspector has learnt that
I've committed the murder.

1275
01:53:33,790 --> 01:53:38,120
Please save me !

1276
01:53:41,410 --> 01:53:42,660
Dear ?

1277
01:54:06,660 --> 01:54:10,950
*INAUDIBLE CONVERSATION*

1278
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:18,160
Namaste Dharmanna !

1279
01:54:19,290 --> 01:54:22,330
Look, you might have
learnt about me !

1280
01:54:22,790 --> 01:54:24,370
But I'll introduce myself.

1281
01:54:24,500 --> 01:54:26,950
I'm Karthik Kashyap, from crime branch.

1282
01:54:28,250 --> 01:54:31,000
Bhaskar Rai's murderer Veena,
is already under arrest.

1283
01:54:31,290 --> 01:54:32,910
But the question
that's haunting is...

1284
01:54:33,750 --> 01:54:36,200
...what pushed her to
commit this murder?

1285
01:54:38,500 --> 01:54:39,910
Mr. Karthik...

1286
01:54:40,290 --> 01:54:43,450
You're accusing a lawyer's sister !

1287
01:54:43,450 --> 01:54:45,750
Mind it! I'll handle this in court.

1288
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:47,250
Okay, fine.

1289
01:54:47,290 --> 01:54:49,660
Mr. Dharmanna,
tell me one thing.

1290
01:54:50,950 --> 01:54:52,790
Veena Shetty, is your second wife.

1291
01:54:52,830 --> 01:54:56,200
But your first wife's death
was very mysterious.

1292
01:54:56,830 --> 01:54:59,540
Can you recall what happened?

1293
01:54:59,620 --> 01:55:02,080
I don't wish to speak of the incident.

1294
01:55:03,330 --> 01:55:06,750
But I want how true
your statements are.

1295
01:55:08,790 --> 01:55:12,000
Just like tonight, it
was the night of Kola.

1296
01:55:12,870 --> 01:55:15,700
I, Bhaskar and Rajshekhara...

1297
01:55:15,750 --> 01:55:16,950
Dharmanna, hold it !

1298
01:55:16,950 --> 01:55:19,660
Karthik, why are you
after an old case?

1299
01:55:19,660 --> 01:55:23,000
The FIR and Post-Mortem
report says it all. It's very clear.

1300
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:24,700
There's no doubt in it.

1301
01:55:24,700 --> 01:55:25,870
Okay !

1302
01:55:25,870 --> 01:55:27,870
Ramaiah ?

1303
01:55:47,580 --> 01:55:49,620
Ullayya !

1304
01:55:49,660 --> 01:55:52,250
- Lord Panjurli !
- For what reason is my kin offering...

1305
01:55:52,250 --> 01:55:54,830
...their prayers in the form
of this auspicious service ?

1306
01:55:54,870 --> 01:55:57,910
Lord Panjurli, nothing escapes
your divine awareness.

1307
01:55:57,910 --> 01:56:00,870
Guttinamane Dharmaraja Shetty,
the one you're protecting,...

1308
01:56:00,910 --> 01:56:03,660
...whose kin has suffered
a mishap, requires...

1309
01:56:03,660 --> 01:56:06,250
...your guidance
and invokes you...

1310
01:56:06,250 --> 01:56:08,700
...in need of
elucidation from you.

1311
01:56:08,750 --> 01:56:12,910
O, an invocation of truth
from the divine power !

1312
01:56:12,950 --> 01:56:15,750
I have been showering signs
on this matter since it began.

1313
01:56:15,790 --> 01:56:17,450
I continue to do so.

1314
01:56:17,450 --> 01:56:19,950
But the judgement day is here !

1315
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,700
Fear not for those who have
suffered will be served justice !

1316
01:56:22,750 --> 01:56:25,790
Fear not ! I shall now give you
the blessed Sandalwood offering.

1317
01:56:25,790 --> 01:56:27,290
We abide by the power, O great Lord.

1318
01:56:28,540 --> 01:56:31,160
As per FIR, Anupama
was murdered by Mary.

1319
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,660
FIR by Rajashekhar.

1320
01:56:35,700 --> 01:56:38,700
Did you believe this to be true ?
Or did you bury the truth ?

1321
01:56:41,700 --> 01:56:43,120
Can you prove this wrong ?

1322
01:56:43,200 --> 01:56:44,870
Mary has revealed it all.

1323
01:56:44,910 --> 01:56:47,040
How long do you plan
to keep the truth covered ?

1324
01:56:47,080 --> 01:56:48,160
Fine !

1325
01:56:48,160 --> 01:56:49,870
I'll give you what you want.

1326
01:56:50,290 --> 01:56:53,500
What Dharmanna caused was an
accidental death. Nothing more.

1327
01:56:53,700 --> 01:56:55,450
The report says it all.

1328
01:56:55,500 --> 01:56:57,290
Don't act too smart Rajshekhar !

1329
01:56:57,660 --> 01:56:59,700
Ramaiah, get them !

1330
01:57:00,620 --> 01:57:04,080
There are certain things in this
report that you don't comprehend.

1331
01:57:04,750 --> 01:57:06,290
Please come !

1332
01:57:07,750 --> 01:57:10,290
Hello, sir !
- Huh? Sudhakar?

1333
01:57:11,450 --> 01:57:13,250
You know him, don't
you Rajshekhar ?

1334
01:57:14,500 --> 01:57:15,540
Huh?

1335
01:57:17,500 --> 01:57:18,870
Let me clear things.

1336
01:57:21,290 --> 01:57:24,000
The Post-mortem report
states two causes of death.

1337
01:57:24,790 --> 01:57:27,450
One is traumatic brain injury,
the other is Hypoxia.

1338
01:57:28,160 --> 01:57:31,040
How can a person die
in two ways, doctor?

1339
01:57:31,250 --> 01:57:33,250
Could you explain
this medical term?

1340
01:57:33,870 --> 01:57:36,620
Hypoxia is when the
brain doesn't receive...

1341
01:57:36,660 --> 01:57:39,160
...enough oxygen due
to suffocation.

1342
01:57:39,160 --> 01:57:40,870
This causes a person's death.

1343
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:44,790
This means, Dharmanna's shove
didn't cause the death.

1344
01:57:45,700 --> 01:57:47,290
Then why did you
write this doctor?

1345
01:57:48,040 --> 01:57:52,370
Rajshekhar and Bhaskar
threatened me to write this.

1346
01:57:52,450 --> 01:57:56,450
But my medical professional
ethics didn't let me to do so.

1347
01:57:56,540 --> 01:57:58,750
The real cause of Anupama
Shetty's death...

1348
01:57:59,370 --> 01:58:01,660
...is suffocation caused
by an external person.

1349
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,410
Therefore, I mentioned Hypoxia.

1350
01:58:05,910 --> 01:58:07,700
Aye, this is all a lie !

1351
01:58:07,750 --> 01:58:09,500
What's the proof
that I've done it?

1352
01:58:09,540 --> 01:58:11,790
Dharmanna, they're all lying !

1353
01:58:11,790 --> 01:58:14,370
The report has been falsified.
This was never in the report.

1354
01:58:14,370 --> 01:58:16,080
Show us where the original report is !

1355
01:58:16,120 --> 01:58:18,580
Doctor, you're a government
servant, don't forget...

1356
01:58:18,580 --> 01:58:19,910
Shut your mouth !

1357
01:58:22,540 --> 01:58:26,700
For twenty five years, I've
grieved over killing my wife !

1358
01:58:28,830 --> 01:58:31,080
You deceived your friend !

1359
01:58:31,330 --> 01:58:35,040
If you'd asked for the property,
I would have given it over !

1360
01:58:36,580 --> 01:58:38,080
Instead,...

1361
01:58:38,580 --> 01:58:39,870
like a pimp...

1362
01:58:40,450 --> 01:58:41,790
you tried to sell your sis....

1363
01:58:41,830 --> 01:58:43,370
Aye, Dharma !
- Aye !

1364
01:58:45,950 --> 01:58:47,330
Stop !

1365
01:58:48,870 --> 01:58:51,540
You aren't even worthy of
calling me by my name !

1366
01:58:53,040 --> 01:58:54,200
Get lost !

1367
01:58:56,660 --> 01:58:57,790
Get the hell out !

1368
01:59:02,120 --> 01:59:04,040
Get out of here !

1369
01:59:05,500 --> 01:59:06,870
Stop this !

1370
01:59:07,250 --> 01:59:08,700
How dare you push me ?

1371
01:59:08,910 --> 01:59:10,250
How dare you ?!

1372
01:59:10,370 --> 01:59:11,910
What do you think of yourself?

1373
01:59:12,080 --> 01:59:14,250
How dare you insult me
in front of everyone ?

1374
01:59:14,330 --> 01:59:16,250
What do you think of me ?

1375
01:59:16,330 --> 01:59:19,700
I'm an advocate.. A criminal
advocate, Rajshekhar !

1376
01:59:19,700 --> 01:59:22,660
I'm tired of taking it all from you !

1377
01:59:22,700 --> 01:59:24,410
I'm fed up of being
known as Dharmanna's...

1378
01:59:24,410 --> 01:59:26,580
...brother-in-law,
Dharmanna's friend !

1379
01:59:26,700 --> 01:59:28,580
I too have an identity, know that !

1380
01:59:29,080 --> 01:59:32,200
And today he chooses to
belittle me in front of them !

1381
01:59:32,950 --> 01:59:36,200
Veena, don't worry. I'll save you !

1382
01:59:37,120 --> 01:59:39,500
Aye, remember what you
did after getting...

1383
01:59:39,500 --> 01:59:42,410
...drunk at my house
that night ?!

1384
01:59:42,450 --> 01:59:44,330
Shall I tell everyone about it ?

1385
01:59:44,370 --> 01:59:47,910
Rajshekhar !
- Aye ! Shut it now !

1386
01:59:48,500 --> 01:59:51,660
All these years, I've saved you !

1387
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:55,450
All this glory of being
'Dharmanna' is because of me !

1388
01:59:56,620 --> 02:00:00,160
I'll tell you something I haven't
revealed all these years !

1389
02:00:01,290 --> 02:00:03,500
You've made a strong mix !

1390
02:00:03,580 --> 02:00:05,870
I'll get some water !
Dharmanna...

1391
02:00:06,160 --> 02:00:09,080
I'll check out the Kola once !

1392
02:00:09,080 --> 02:00:10,500
You finish and leave soon.

1393
02:00:10,540 --> 02:00:12,330
Shekhara, take it easy
with the drinks !

1394
02:00:12,370 --> 02:00:14,790
You can't handle it !
- Pour some more.

1395
02:00:14,790 --> 02:00:19,160
Enough ! Brother, I shall leave.
Any offerings?

1396
02:00:21,750 --> 02:00:22,750
Here !

1397
02:00:23,660 --> 02:00:25,410
A little more would do well !

1398
02:00:26,330 --> 02:00:28,950
This is all you
get, keep going !

1399
02:00:30,750 --> 02:00:32,750
We'll finish this and be back soon.

1400
02:00:46,540 --> 02:00:48,580
I've had enough !

1401
02:01:27,290 --> 02:01:29,660
Oye, Dharma !

1402
02:01:40,370 --> 02:01:42,950
Brother ?!

1403
02:01:52,790 --> 02:01:54,830
Dharma !

1404
02:02:00,950 --> 02:02:03,700
Aye, I won't spare you tonight !

1405
02:02:51,830 --> 02:02:54,040
Aye, Mary ! Stop !

1406
02:02:54,080 --> 02:02:55,700
Where are you going
with the baby ?

1407
02:02:55,750 --> 02:02:58,450
Rajshekhar !
- Dharmanna !

1408
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
Please help !

1409
02:03:04,620 --> 02:03:07,120
She.. took the baby.. !

1410
02:03:07,160 --> 02:03:09,870
Rajshekhara ! The baby ?!

1411
02:03:10,200 --> 02:03:12,160
What the hell did you do ?

1412
02:03:13,500 --> 02:03:15,120
What did you do ?

1413
02:03:15,120 --> 02:03:17,370
What did you do at my place ?

1414
02:03:17,750 --> 02:03:20,450
You raped my sister,
and you came here...

1415
02:03:20,660 --> 02:03:23,830
...and murdered your wife !
- Rajshekhara !

1416
02:03:24,120 --> 02:03:26,080
Aye, I won't spare you !

1417
02:03:26,120 --> 02:03:29,120
Rajshekhara, listen to me !

1418
02:03:29,120 --> 02:03:32,040
Listen to me ! She
scolded me in anger !

1419
02:03:32,080 --> 02:03:34,750
I just pushed her
and she fell down !

1420
02:03:34,950 --> 02:03:36,910
I didn't do anything.

1421
02:03:36,950 --> 02:03:38,790
What happened at your
house, was wrong !

1422
02:03:38,830 --> 02:03:41,160
I won't let you get away !
- Forgive me !

1423
02:03:48,250 --> 02:03:49,750
Rajshekhara !

1424
02:03:51,410 --> 02:03:53,040
Please save me !

1425
02:04:08,410 --> 02:04:10,580
Hello? Inspector ?
This is,...

1426
02:04:10,620 --> 02:04:13,290
...Lawyer Rajshekhara speaking !

1427
02:04:13,450 --> 02:04:15,120
I'm calling from
Dharmanna's house.

1428
02:04:15,160 --> 02:04:18,330
Their maid has hit
Dharmanna's wife on her head...

1429
02:04:18,370 --> 02:04:20,250
...and is running
away with their child.

1430
02:04:20,290 --> 02:04:22,200
Please come fast !
- Rajshekhara !

1431
02:04:22,250 --> 02:04:24,120
She's breathing ! Come fast !

1432
02:04:27,660 --> 02:04:29,620
Hold her ! Carefully !

1433
02:04:29,660 --> 02:04:31,790
Oh my ! What happened ?

1434
02:04:32,290 --> 02:04:34,080
Pick her up carefully !

1435
02:04:35,080 --> 02:04:36,950
Be careful !

1436
02:04:38,660 --> 02:04:41,080
Let's get going !

1437
02:04:41,620 --> 02:04:44,830
I'll be back with the key !
- Get it soon !

1438
02:04:45,330 --> 02:04:48,540
Come here ! Come aside !
- What is it ?

1439
02:04:49,700 --> 02:04:51,830
What are you going to do ?
- What happened ?

1440
02:04:51,950 --> 02:04:54,040
Why do you have to
save his wife ?

1441
02:04:54,750 --> 02:04:58,160
How long do you plan
to live in his mercy ?

1442
02:04:58,200 --> 02:04:59,250
What are you saying?

1443
02:04:59,250 --> 02:05:02,870
He's already finished
his wife by half...

1444
02:05:03,080 --> 02:05:04,370
And now...

1445
02:05:04,830 --> 02:05:07,410
You complete the task !
- What the hell are you saying ?

1446
02:05:07,450 --> 02:05:09,620
I'm saying the right thing.
Hear me out !

1447
02:05:09,660 --> 02:05:13,660
The guilt of having killed his
wife, will keep haunting him !

1448
02:05:14,330 --> 02:05:17,580
You wait for the right
time and fulfil your...

1449
02:05:17,580 --> 02:05:21,790
...wish of getting your
sister married to him !

1450
02:05:22,830 --> 02:05:26,290
He's coming ! Don't worry.
Get started !

1451
02:05:26,370 --> 02:05:29,200
Brother, let's go quickly !

1452
02:05:29,200 --> 02:05:31,370
Start the vehicle soon !

1453
02:05:31,370 --> 02:05:34,500
Shekhara, get on soon !
- Rajshekhara !

1454
02:05:35,040 --> 02:05:36,700
Move it !

1455
02:05:49,790 --> 02:05:52,660
What happened?
- Nothing ! Keep driving !

1456
02:06:01,620 --> 02:06:04,000
Rajshekhara, is she still breathing ?

1457
02:06:04,370 --> 02:06:07,000
She is ! Keep driving !

1458
02:06:34,080 --> 02:06:36,540
Look ahead and drive !

1459
02:07:09,620 --> 02:07:11,290
Yes !

1460
02:07:11,500 --> 02:07:14,000
It was I who killed her !
Yes !

1461
02:07:14,870 --> 02:07:17,830
No evidence can harm me !

1462
02:07:18,120 --> 02:07:21,200
I'll close the case with
the snap of my fingers !

1463
02:07:21,500 --> 02:07:24,000
Nobody can do anything to me !

1464
02:08:03,160 --> 02:08:08,450
Dharma and Veena who are facing
punishment as per the law,...

1465
02:08:09,700 --> 02:08:12,500
are awaited by the
Guttinamane kin !

1466
02:08:14,330 --> 02:08:16,620
The religious traditions here,...

1467
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:19,700
...continue to retain its
value among the people.

1468
02:08:20,080 --> 02:08:23,120
Strengthening itself with time !

1469
02:08:25,120 --> 02:08:29,120
People's opinion on
Guttinamane has changed !

1470
02:08:30,580 --> 02:08:34,540
Karthik and Vikram continue
to live peacefully !

1471
02:08:36,290 --> 02:08:39,700
Yes, did you realise who I am ?

1472
02:08:40,910 --> 02:08:42,410
This is David !

1473
02:08:43,330 --> 02:08:45,700
I'm presently with Karthik !

1474
02:08:47,620 --> 02:08:49,750
Let's meet again !
