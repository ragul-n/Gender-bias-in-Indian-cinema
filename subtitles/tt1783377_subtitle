Doors of our kingdom
welcome you as our ultimate king

19
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:15,689
Goddess of dharma guides you
to rule the country

20
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:26,742
Four Vedas trumpet sounds
with jubilation

21
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:32,080
Goddess of law blows conch
then, showers of flowers rain down

22
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:37,753

pay its respects

23
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:42,674
The throne of Sun dynasty
greets him with exaltation

24
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:48,597
When your touch the earth,
there is a feeling of flying on air

00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:54,269
Sri Rama who gives pleasure to the world...
and beloved consort of Janaki

26
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:59,608
Welcome to you, the glorious ruler!

27

Welcome to you, the glorious ruler!

29
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:38,355
Land proves that Rama's reign
is like the celestial cow

30
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:43,944
Sea extols Rama's commands
can't be opposed

31
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:54,913
Stone says that meeting Rama
gives virtuousness

32
00:06:54,997 --> 00:07:00,585
Rama's kingdom, shows his subjects
the righteous path

33
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:05,924
Rama mantrarf is Tharakam
it gives eternal strength

34
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:11,179
Rama's name is ambrosia
Rama's chanting spells good fortune

35
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:17,018
The supreme power says
he's the protector of world

36
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:22,774
Sri Rama who gives pleasure to the world...
and beloved consort of Janaki

37
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:28,113
Welcome to you, the glorious ruler!

38

Sri Rama who gives pleasure to the world...

00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:39,082
Welcome to you, the glorious ruler!

40
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:44,421

41
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:49,009

44
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:06,943
Sri Rama who gives pleasure to the world...
and beloved consort of Janaki

45
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:13,366
Welcome to you, the Supreme ruler!

46
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:49,819
Ramachandra! Here is the creator
of your family dynasty, Sun God

47
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:55,867
...Progenitor of Raghukula dynasty
Pay your greetings to him

48
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:05,252
The one who rides the chariot
with seven horses

49
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:12,175
Son of Kasyaparf
the one who gives lighting to the world

50
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:20,559
The one who has white lotus

51
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:26,648
I salute you, Sun God!

52
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:40,579
Gurudeva, Sage Vasishta!

53
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:46,835
We greet you!
You taught us not to be unjust!

54
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,296
Long live

55
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:54,194
Today's coronation was decided
by King Dasaratha 14 years ago

56
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:56,446
That auspicious time is today

57
00:10:56,530 --> 00:11:01,618
Both, that day's decision and
today's auspicious event are decided by God

58
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:04,913
But this is significant

59
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:10,919
Generally, kings who rule the country
will ride the king's chariot...

60
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:16,257
...after their coronation

61
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:21,012
But today, Rama will be
coronated as king...

62
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:28,520
...after having destroyed Ravana & his demons
thus saving the honor of our kingdom

63
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:31,481
He is the only king to be
officially coronated...

64
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:34,109
...after discharging his duty as a king!

65
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:46,496
Hail King Rama
Victory to him

66
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:52,043
Rama, the heir of Inavamsam,
Ikshvaku dynasty protector,

67
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:57,048
...great grandson of King Raghu,
grandson of King Ajamahudu...

68
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:59,968
...and son of King Dasaratha,

69
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:06,057
He becomes the ruler of Ayodhya
being blessed by all the Gods

70
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:46,514
I, Rama greets you all in front of Sita,
Lakshmana, Bharatha, Shathrugna and Hanuma

71
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:53,229
Water and wind, hot and shadow,
day and night

72
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:54,606
Those are equal to everyone

73
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:59,694
The equality as promise,
and justice as God...

74
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:04,616
I swear that I'll rule this country
with my full strength

75
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:08,036
Victory to King Ramachandra

76
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:13,875
Having faith in me
you have made me king

77
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:23,051
It's not right to think that a King enjoys
his life and rules by sitting on the throne

78
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,136
Ranjaithe ithi rajaha

79
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:31,226
It means whoever pleases his people
and makes them happy, is their King

80
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,478
So it has been said by our ancestors

81
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:38,983
I believe that people are more important
than my family and myself

82
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:44,656
I am accepting this post to be
a judge to this kingdom's heritage

83
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:48,993
Ramarajyam means
this country will be cared by Rama

84
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:53,248
Then only it will be ruled by Rama

85
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,124
I greet you all

86
00:13:55,209 --> 00:14:01,214
Hail Rama
Victory to you

87
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:18,731
Let good fortune shower
on our benevolent king Rama

88
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:30,243
Let happiness rain
on the husband of Janaki, the ruler

89
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:39,294
Let the fortune of victory
prevail with him always

90
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:54,392
Be prosperous Kosavendrayarf
who has great virtue

91
00:14:55,019 --> 00:15:13,703
Be prosperous the son of the emperor,
the mighty

92
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:34,265
Lord Ramachandra!

93
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:39,687
By the instructions of lord Brahma,
by the inspiration of saint Naradha

94
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:43,733
I, Valmiki, started to write the epic,
Sri Ramayana

95
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:46,319
And it has been completed today

96
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:50,156
Let all humans enjoy listening
to this Rama Katha Sudha,

97
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:56,913
...which blesses us with virtues
and forgives our sins

98
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:59,916
Ending!? Is the story completed?

99
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,250
It was very inspiring

100
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:04,587
If it continues,
it will be even more interesting

101
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:07,966
Do you want more?

102
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:17,558
We cannot be satisfied
Let us listen to Rama's story many times

103
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:23,064
But, stories are made with
mixture of happiness and sorrow

104
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:26,943
Sita and Rama have faced
many troubles for 14 years

105
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:29,445
At the last they are united

106
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:31,531
So the story is complete

107
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:34,283
Henceforth there are no troubles, only joy

108
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:37,870
If there are no troubles,
can't tell stories?

109
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,330
If it is so, leave it

110
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:44,460
Let there not be troubles for
Sita and Rama even as a mere tale

111
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:50,883
Nothing is in our hands
It's all God's play

112
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:56,472
Only He knows how many
twists and turns happen in this story

113
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:20,121
You belong to Sun dynasty
but adorn Moon's dot

114
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:26,627
- Is it your kindness or else...?
- Else...!

115
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:31,132
- Finding faults?
- Got a doubt?

116
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:40,141
Seems like you are hiding something
Look at the waistband

117
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:50,234
It seems like a new jewel

118
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:55,782
The affection of love is
reddened by betel nut and leaves

119
00:17:55,866 --> 00:18:00,995
It is time to make it come true

120
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:06,250
To make loverf when Moon appears...

121
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:11,172
Every night, Sita's heart becomes a bed

122
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:21,182
Silence also is sweet
Time is utilized well

123
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:26,938
This is the love-world of Rama
Let this bond forever bloom

124
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:31,609
It is a pure form of freedom
with Sun and Moon as witnesses

125
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:37,365
This Divine bond can never be parted

126
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:44,497
Sri Rama Raghu Rama
A mesmerizing chant

127
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:53,047
Has Sita's love tied the hands of Rama?

128
00:18:53,132 --> 00:19:00,304
Sri Rama's affection,
Sita's sudation

129
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:01,472
Does my mother know about this?

130
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:07,728
Love of Sri Rama's...
will be quenched by Sita

131
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:13,151
This is a bond that can never be parted

132
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:17,905
We have to perform
bangle ceremony for the girls

133
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:22,577
Our priests have fixed
an auspicious time for the event

134
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:25,746
If you permit them, with your blessings...

135
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:33,588
...we'll take Sita, Urmila, Mandavi,
and Sudha Keerthi with us to our home

136
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,673
Why do you ask like that, brother?

137
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:39,927
It is our custom to perform
the bangle ceremony at the girl's residence

138
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:41,554
We can't oppose that

139
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:46,142
Even if we agree,
your sons-in-law should also permit

140
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:48,311
What do you say Ramaiah?

141
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:52,815
Son-in-law, you are still standing

142
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:58,112
You may be our son-in-law,
but you are the king of Ayodhya

143
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,655
Please be seated

144
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:04,952
Though I am the king of Ayodhya,
I am a son to my mother

145
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:09,040
This is the correct place for me
when mother is here

146
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:10,583
May you be prosperous!

147
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:15,213
May you be happy! Only Rama
can guarantee this!

148
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:18,633
Come girls!

149
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,262
Father! Are you fine?

150
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:27,642
Your parents have come to take you home

151
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:32,230
- It is our duty to bless you
- It is your duty to bear babies

152
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:38,653
Are you fine, dear?

153
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:44,742
Get ready to travel
Okay?

154
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:53,334
Their faces brightened after hearing
that they are leaving with their parents

155
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:08,641
- Maharaja
- Son-in-law

156
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:12,937
It is common to address me
formally in the court

157
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:18,776
But call me 'father-in-law' at home
My daughter will feel happy

158
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:23,239
Father-in-law! I've got a message
from the Royal court

159
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:26,617
- Shall I visit them once?
- King's duty!? Certainly

160
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:29,620
First subjects, then we look into
our personal issues

161
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:41,966
Fine, since king is not here,
let's get the consent of queen Sita devi

162
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:46,804
Will any girl refuse to go
to her parents' home?

163
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:58,858
It is not right
People may mistake us

164
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:03,738
Just listen to me, father!
I can't stay there leaving him alone here

165
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:14,248
My older daughter Sita is not agreeing
to the bangle ceremony at her parents' home

166
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,001
She says that she can't come
leaving her husband alone here

167
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:21,630
That is true, brother
She is right

168
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:27,011
Though she was not needed,
she didn't abandon her husband

169
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:30,931
She went with him to the forest
and faced many troubles for 14 years

170
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:31,849
Yes...yes

171
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:36,854
It is not correct to make them part
with bangle ceremony as an excuse

172
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:39,899
No one has the power to reject her wish

173
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:42,651
I accept it whole heartedly

174
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:57,458
Though your parents felt sad
you made your in-laws happy

175
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:01,212
I'm more happy than everyone else

176
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,924
Unexpected gift
I liked it

177
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:08,636
Ask whatever boon you want

178
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:13,182
Boon!? l don't want any boon

179
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:20,314
Why are you shocked?

180
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:22,650
I am afraid of boons

181
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:27,822
Boons didn't suit my father-in-law

182
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:34,662
Because of those boons, I had
to go to the forest and kill Ravana

183
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:41,919
...and achieve victory, world peace,
prosperity to the kingdom

184
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:45,881
Fine, forget it

185
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:50,928
Ask me your wish
in this happy moment

186
00:23:56,476 --> 00:24:02,898
King! My wish may not come true

187
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:04,358
Don't have doubts

188
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:07,820
When did I ever reject any wish
you asked from me?

189
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:09,864
Tell me

190
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:15,161
This wish is not for me
It is for us

191
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:19,248
The fruit of my prayer,
is to give birth to a healthy baby

192
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,876
And for his happiness

193
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:25,129
I want to get
the blessings of hermits' wives

194
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:28,799
You wish to go to the forest

195
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:35,389
In your 3rd trimester
if you wish to travel into the forest

196
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:38,851
King's mothers, elders of our
clan won't accept

197
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:40,144
I know that

198
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:46,859
- My wish is not an easy one
- Let's make it happen

199
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:52,281
It is your wish that it should happen
before you deliver the baby

200
00:24:52,365 --> 00:24:57,870
So, let's tell them we must
do some offering and go there

201
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:01,123
- Then let's go tomorrow
- Tomorrow!?

202
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:03,125
It is said when a deer wakes up
it starts to run

203
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:09,924
What? Are you scared
listening to the word deer?

204
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:14,136
I didn't mean that magic deer
This is an innocent deer

205
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:46,627
- Have betel-nut
- Justice bell is ringing

206
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:49,004
Is this the time for that bell to ring?

207
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:54,134
- Dangers don't come according to time
- It is ringing continuously

208
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:58,597
But it is king's duty
to attend to the matter immediately

209
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:00,975
Married life also is a duty

210
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:06,355
Not married life, service
is the greatest dharma of all dharmas

211
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:13,237
Oh my dear! This Rama is faithful,
diligent and slave to that dharma

212
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:37,428
My lord! I am Bhadrudu,
the chief spy in this Ayodhya

213
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:42,683
They are spies roaming
all over this kingdom

214
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:45,686
...to get information about
kingdom's security and people's welfare

215
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:48,063
My lord! I am from East
from West

216
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:51,191
...from North
from South

217
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:58,824
People are facing many troubles
in your kingdom

218
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:03,912
Troubles like, there are no beggars
even if the rich want to give alms

219
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:05,998
Only pleasures, no diseases

220
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:09,209
All the hospitals are shutdown
and are being destroyed

221
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:13,130
No work for Yama (Death-lord)'s men
They are chiding him

222
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:19,428
Heaps of gold, diamonds, rubies
and gems are being sold like vegetables!

223
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:22,890
- Stop flattering me
- No, my lord

224
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:26,518
People are living happily in our kingdom

225
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:28,562
Good, I am very happy

226
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:34,652
Though everything is safe,
you have to be alert always

227
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:38,238
You know that troubles
don't give a warning

228
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:41,283
Bhadra! What news have you brought now?

229
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:43,160
Is everyone fine?

230
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:46,080
I must convey what was told verbatim!

231
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:48,707
Everyone is happy and rich

232
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:53,128
Under your rule, there is no place
for any word other than happiness

233
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:55,464
And it's impossible

234
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:04,890
- Guards! You go and do your duty
- We obey you

235
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:13,232
- Bhadra! Tell me
- There is nothing to tell, my lord

236
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:15,442
Everything is safe
and everyone is happy

237
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:18,445
Bhadra! Look at me

238
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:25,202
Seeing your appearance
and facial expression

239
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:29,957
I believe that there is no link
between your inner thought and speech

240
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:34,211
- I sense fear in you
- Nothing like that, my lord

241
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:38,424
I am very tired and no sleep
That's all

242
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:43,470
Hiding the truth is worse
than telling a lie

243
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:45,264
It's dangerous

244
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:48,267
Whatever the blame is...tell me

245
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,819
My lord!

246
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:19,840
Uncle! Sister is here

247
00:29:20,216 --> 00:29:22,342
- Come
- Enough, brother-in-law!

248
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:30,934
My wife is pregnant

249
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:34,229
It took 4 days for your wife to
come here after completing her prayers

250
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:35,564
Don't mistake her

251
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:40,235
Stop right there

252
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,070
I'll kill you
if you step inside

253
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:44,281
You went to your parents' home
on Full moon day

254
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:45,282
...and returned home on New moon day

255
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:48,243
- What is the matter?
- Nothing, dear

256
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:51,997
My sister is pregnant
Don't you know that?

257
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:55,250
Because of my old mother's request,
I stayed behind a few days

258
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:58,045
- Was that a mistake?
- Mistake!?

259
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:01,215
Your sister conceived and
you enjoyed with your brother-in-law

260
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:03,217
You think l didn't know that

261
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:05,219
Don't shout
I'll kill you

262
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:07,262
Listen aunt! What he is saying?

263
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:11,391
Oh God! I swear on you
I swear on my mother

264
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:14,394
I am not like that woman
Not at all

265
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:17,606
I swear on my mother
I swear on our family deity

266
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:19,900
What is this Thippa?
Your wife is like a flame?

267
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:22,653
You'll go blind if you blame her

268
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:24,738
How could you accuse her, you damn idiot?

269
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:26,865
- Damn your mouth
- You are committing a blunder

270
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:27,866
Leave me

271
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:31,620
This immoral Sivangi!
I don't know if she was faithful

272
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:32,746
...or she was hand in glove with her lover

273
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:36,875
She went to her parents' home
promising to be back the next day

274
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,794
Not 1 or 2 days, but 10 days

275
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:40,504
She stayed behind without returning home

276
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:42,589
I won't accept this immoral woman

277
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:43,715
Don't get angry

278
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,134
Don't spoil your life with your own hands

279
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:49,847
Let's go to King Rama's court
He'll give the judgment fairly

280
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:50,848
Leave my hand

281
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:53,267
King Rama!? His judgment!?

282
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:55,269
Can an accused give me judgment?

283
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,854
If you blame him
you'll be blinded

284
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,481
- You'll be reduced to ashes
- Why should I turn into ashes?

285
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:02,442
Has he come from the sky?
He is also a human like us

286
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:06,280
His wife was captured
by a stranger for a year...

287
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:08,490
...but now he is living with her
without any shame

288
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:12,911
- What did you say, you fool?
- Oh mother!

289
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:14,788
Why are you hitting me, you old man?

290
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:16,623
Did I say anything wrong?

291
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:20,419
Now tell me

292
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:24,298
Shamelessly he brought his wife
from a stranger's home

293
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:26,174
...where she was for a year
and now he's living with her, isn't it?

294
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:28,677
Answer me

295
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:30,637
Tell me, isn't he living with her or not?

296
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,348
Why don't you speak up?
Come on, tell me

297
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:35,893
Isn't he living with her or not?

298
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:39,396
Shamelessly he brought his wife,
from a stranger's home

299
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:43,400
...where she was for a year
and now he's living with her, isn't it?

300
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:49,907
My lord! It was a drunkard's words

301
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:53,243
Like stones from a beggar

302
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:56,705
Don't believe that
Don't mind what he blabbered

303
00:31:57,624 --> 00:32:02,085
I had to tell you about that incident
because of your repeated questions

304
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:05,130
That's all

305
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:10,928
Get up

306
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:21,521
Bhadra! You heard it and
saw with your own eyes, right?

307
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:26,276
- Who is there?
- Your order, my lord

308
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:30,030
- Call Lakshmana, Bharatha
and Shatrugna - l obey you, my lord

309
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:37,496
Bhadra! You can go

310
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:42,542
- My lord! - It's king's orders
Don't tell anything

311
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:46,254
Go
Go away

312
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,710
I don't want this kingdom or this crown

313
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:29,715
I don't want this kingdom
Sita...Sita

314
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:31,466
I don't want this crown

315
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:37,973
Sita...Sita

316
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:47,232
I don't want this kingdom
Sita...Sita

317
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:51,028
I don't want this crown
Sita...Sita

318
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:56,950
- My lord!
- Sita

319
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:26,980
I don't want

320
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:30,192
I don't want either this throne
or this kingdom

321
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:31,860
I want my Sita

322
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,322
- Sita...Sita
- Brother!

323
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:37,824
Sita is here
She is with you safely

324
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:42,871
She can't be like that henceforth
It is my fate

325
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:46,374
- Sita...Sita!
- Brother! lt is some nightmare

326
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:48,376
It is your illusion
it's confusing you

327
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:51,463
No...no, it's not an illusion

328
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:53,423
It is a game, played by fate

329
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:57,260
I won't surrender to it
I won't lose my Sita

330
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:59,721
- Sita...Sita
- Brother...brother

331
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:07,938
Dear brothers! Any one of you
can take this throne

332
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:11,650
Release me from this jail
I want my Sita

333
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:15,028
I can't abandon my Sita
I can't bear that loneliness

334
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:18,240
Abandon...loneliness!
Brother! What are you saying?

335
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:20,992
We don't understand you
Stop playing the fool

336
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:24,371
I am not kidding
It is pure truth

337
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:28,500
I'll perform your coronation
tomorrow morning

338
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:31,211
I'll also go along
with my Sita to the forests

339
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,505
Let the inauspicious words vanish

340
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:38,593
Brother! Don't be hasty
Please relax

341
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:39,511
No relaxation

342
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:44,558
I must abandon either Sita or the throne

343
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:49,104
Abandon Sita!?
Why this disastrous decision?

344
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:53,108
Yes, it's a disastrous decision
I got blamed terribly

345
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:55,569
Eclipse has afflicted our Sun dynasty

346
00:35:56,112 --> 00:36:00,574
Our dynasty's prestige is at stake!

347
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:03,827
- Brother!
- Bharatha! What can I say?

348
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:09,875
In our kingdom a man blamed
his wife's conduct and sent her away

349
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:12,836
When people around him
demanded an explanation

350
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:17,090
He said that to live
with this dishonest lady...

351
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:21,970
he was not like Rama who brought Sita
from Ravana's custody

352
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:25,599
...after a year and started living with her

353
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,726
Who is that idiot, who said that?

354
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:29,728
I'll cut him into many pieces

355
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:34,149
Can you kill all the people
who blame me?

356
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:38,028
- Brother!
- Yes

357
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:42,741
It could be false or true
People are believing this

358
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:48,496
When he asked them
how they'd behave in such a situation

359
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:52,417
...no one uttered a word
or opposed it

360
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:56,004
They were all silent

361
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:59,049
She proved her chastity in the fire test

362
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:03,511
Fire test happened in the kingdom of Lanka

363
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:05,430
How would they know about it?

364
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:10,518
It is their belief and their judgment

365
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:14,439
A true king is a slave to his subjects

366
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:18,360
He has to respect
their beliefs and judgment

367
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:20,862
No one opposed this judgment

368
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:23,615
If I want my kingdom
I have to sacrifice my wife

369
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:27,494
Or if I want my wife
I have to give up my kingdom

370
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:30,330
That's correct

371
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:37,921
Brothers! I don't want this kingdom
I want my Sita

372
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:42,634
Sita is my life
There is no Rama without Sita

373
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,052
And he can't exist

374
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:47,639
Though you are younger than me
I plead to you

375
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:50,767
Any one of you can accept this crown

376
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:52,435
Share this burden

377
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,021
Show your kindness on
your brother and sister-in-law

378
00:37:55,147 --> 00:37:57,774
Don't inherit this sin
of parting Sita and Rama

379
00:37:57,942 --> 00:38:00,568
Release us
Allow us to go to the forest

380
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:02,153
Brother!

381
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:06,074
Not one of us has the strength
to adorn your crown

382
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:09,119
...and no eligibility or capacity

383
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:13,206
If you order us
we'll be ready to jump into fire

384
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,583
- But...
- Brother

385
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:19,713
We are your slaves and servants
That's all

386
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:24,926
Slaves and Servants!?

387
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:28,096
No, you are not my servants

388
00:38:28,597 --> 00:38:29,764
You are servants to the God of death

389
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:34,894
By calling me your brother
you are trying to destroy my life

390
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:42,610
Okay, my slaves, my servants
I order you

391
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:46,698
Lakshmana! Take your sister-in-law and
leave her in the forest tomorrow morning

392
00:38:46,782 --> 00:38:49,951
This soil became virtuous
after she was born

393
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:53,163
This dynasty got prosperous
after she came here

394
00:38:53,622 --> 00:38:57,751
And all the sins vanished
when people chanted Sita's name

395
00:38:58,127 --> 00:39:00,962
That honorable woman...that virtuous woman...

396
00:39:01,088 --> 00:39:02,881
Stop your eulogy

397
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:05,884
- Bharatha! You go...
- Brother!

398
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:09,846
You are very kind
But now you are angry

399
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:12,140
You are not compassionate now

400
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:19,564
It is not my wish
It is my duty

401
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:23,401
From Ikshavaku's to my father King Dasaratha,
our elders got name and fame

402
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:27,655
...bearing many troubles and
sacrificing many things

403
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:30,325
I have no right to tarnish that record

404
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,203
There is only 1 option

405
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:40,085
To preserve our dynasty's
prestige, Sita and l...

406
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:44,714
...should live with the pain
and pangs of separation

407
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:47,384
It's fate that has
decided this life for us

408
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:48,802
Brother!

409
00:39:55,851 --> 00:40:00,730
Lakshmana! On that day, when Sita
requested you to arrange the fire in Lanka

410
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:02,315
...you did it

411
00:40:03,275 --> 00:40:08,780
Today Rama orders you
to leave Sita in the forest

412
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:13,910
Leave her near Sage Valmiki's hermitage

413
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:23,711
Keep this a secret

414
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:21,663
Chariot is ready

415
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:33,007
I am also ready

416
00:42:55,155 --> 00:43:00,034
Why didn't you adorn the jewels?

417
00:43:00,202 --> 00:43:02,745
I am going to seek the blessings
of hermits' wives

418
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:05,039
No need ofjewels and cosmetics

419
00:43:05,207 --> 00:43:08,334
They won't recognize me
if I go like that

420
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:14,215
They'll greet me

421
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:17,093
They'll get scared
if they know that I am a queen

422
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:21,389
...and they won't see
and speak to me

423
00:43:21,473 --> 00:43:24,934
Even if the king comes with me
we'll go dressed in this manner

424
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:27,061
- Where is he?
- He won't come

425
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:30,398
I mean he can't come now

426
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:36,821
I see, then l'll go and get his blessings

427
00:43:36,905 --> 00:43:39,490
That's not possible
He is taking rest

428
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:06,559
If we delay,
the auspicious time for travel will go

429
00:44:07,269 --> 00:44:08,561
Okay

430
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:13,251
Wind, Sky, Water, Earthrf and Fire...

431
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:19,298
None of you could oppose
Rama's decision

432
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:25,221
Who committed the crime?
Who got punished?

433
00:45:25,305 --> 00:45:30,852
Who could stop this atrocity?
Who is it?

434
00:45:30,936 --> 00:45:33,604
Sages and hermits are not present

435
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:36,607
Where have the philosophers gone?

436
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:42,405
Is it fair to the journey
which moves silently?

437
00:45:42,489 --> 00:45:48,327
Hills, mounds, forest, waterfalls
and Sarayu river

438
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:54,083
Ask, if it is fair to him?

439
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:59,839
Wind, Sky, Water, Earthrf and Fire...

440
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:02,925
None of you could oppose
Rama's decision

441
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:16,689
Will you forsake the promise you gave?

442
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:24,071
Will you oppose the promise made
by you in the middle of court hall?

443
00:46:24,823 --> 00:46:27,533
Will you oppose the Truth?

444
00:46:28,827 --> 00:46:36,542
Will you support the lie
for sake of your happiness and your wife?

445
00:46:37,377 --> 00:46:42,215
It's not good
Rama, it's not good for you

446
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:48,137
Will you insult
your ancestors, inhabitantsrf...

447
00:46:48,263 --> 00:46:52,225
...and your father who abandoned you
for his promise?

448
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:53,726
It is not justice

449
00:46:53,852 --> 00:47:01,275
Will you betray the truth
for your pleasures and married life?

450
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,319
It is not good for you, Rama

451
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:07,949
It's not good

452
00:47:37,312 --> 00:47:42,817
Wind, Sky, Water, Earthrf and Fire...

453
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:48,990
None of you could oppose
Rama's decision

454
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:01,377
Lakshmana! Where is the hermitage?

455
00:48:01,461 --> 00:48:06,090
It is situated nearby

456
00:48:06,341 --> 00:48:09,343
- Come, let's go there
- I got orders to leave you here

457
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:11,554
Orders!?

458
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:17,560
What orders? Who gave?
For whom? And why?

459
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:24,442
- To leave you in the forest
- Lakshmana! Are you joking?

460
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:28,362
Did Rama order you to leave me
in this dense forest?

461
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:34,285
Not Rama's orders, lt is the king's orders

462
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:38,164
...to leave you near the hermitage

463
00:48:39,207 --> 00:48:42,376
Did he order you to leave me here?
So, he is...

464
00:48:43,211 --> 00:48:44,503
He is not coming

465
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:51,928
Why Lakshmana?
I don't understand

466
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:09,695
Don't forgive me
Curse me

467
00:49:09,988 --> 00:49:14,408
- Turn me into ashes
- Lakshmana! What is this?

468
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:18,496
Don't hurt me and kill me
with your words, tell me clearly

469
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:30,508
Ayodhya's king Rama
abandoned you, queen Sita

470
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:37,890
You are exiled from the kingdom
It's the king's orders

471
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:40,518
Similarly Rama's orders

472
00:49:42,562 --> 00:49:47,233
Did my lord abandon me?

473
00:49:58,495 --> 00:50:02,498
Hey Lord Siva and Parvathy!
Oh, five elements...

474
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:06,419
Oh! Goddess of earth!
Protect my sister-in-law!

475
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:10,548
Take care of her from all dangers

476
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:35,531
My lord! You are very kind
to forgive your enemies

477
00:50:37,075 --> 00:50:39,326
Why this fate?

478
00:50:39,995 --> 00:50:43,873
Why did you give such a horrible
punishment to your wife?

479
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:49,879
What is this unkindness?
Why this punishment?

480
00:50:53,675 --> 00:50:57,553
Tell me what crime
and sin did l commit

481
00:50:58,513 --> 00:51:03,100
Are you justified to punish me
without telling me the reason?

482
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:08,022
Lakshmana! At least you tell me

483
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:17,531
Your crime was you were prisoner
in Ravana's custody for a year

484
00:51:18,366 --> 00:51:20,618
It was the complaint of the people

485
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:23,579
That's why, this punishment

486
00:51:24,164 --> 00:51:27,291
You know I went
through the chastity test, by fire

487
00:51:27,375 --> 00:51:30,461
He said it was done
in the kingdom of Lanka

488
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:37,635
People of Ayodhya refuse
to accept that news

489
00:51:39,012 --> 00:51:49,313
They said that a demon kidnapped you
and this man accepted you as his queen

490
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:55,945
You are not eligible to be a queen

491
00:51:59,866 --> 00:52:08,582
- Is the king believing this gossip?
- No

492
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:16,966
Being a king, he had to do this
without tarnishing the name of his dynasty

493
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:21,762
Lakshmana! I am his wife
and a pregnant woman

494
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:26,517
Will your dynasty's fame increase
if you leave me alone in this forest?

495
00:52:27,727 --> 00:52:30,688
If he is the king, can't I be a queen?

496
00:52:31,064 --> 00:52:32,940
Don't I have any responsibility?

497
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:37,695
Will I get a bad name for his dynasty?

498
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:43,200
Though I'm a sinner, if he had
called me and ordered me

499
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:49,707
...after confiding this in me
I'd have gladly jumped again into the fire

500
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:57,840
I can't bear these flames of insult
which is hotter than the flames of fire!

501
00:52:58,425 --> 00:53:01,177
I'd be better off dying
by jumping into the water

502
00:53:01,261 --> 00:53:04,638
Swear on me
Swear on your future baby

503
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:11,145
Raghuvamsam flame which grows
in your womb should flash

504
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:13,272
It should light hundreds of lamps

505
00:53:19,821 --> 00:53:25,159
Won't this blame fostered
on me affect my fetus?

506
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:38,172
How can I show my face to the people?

507
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:43,052
How can I answer them if they ask me
why my husband abandoned me?

508
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:46,472
How can I live now?

509
00:53:54,856 --> 00:53:59,860
You are the daughter of Earth
which carries all the burden

510
00:54:00,403 --> 00:54:05,783
You should prove the world
that truth and justice will win someday

511
00:54:11,998 --> 00:54:14,667
Like losing his heart,

512
00:54:15,377 --> 00:54:21,173
Rama is in deep sorrow
after parting from his wife

513
00:54:21,758 --> 00:54:26,345
Can he live for a second without you?

514
00:54:29,557 --> 00:54:35,229
You are right, l couldn't
control my sorrow

515
00:54:35,855 --> 00:54:39,942
I was harsh

516
00:54:42,195 --> 00:54:48,575
It is the sin of my previous birth
to be away and not serve him

517
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:53,497
I am born to suffer

518
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:58,836
I'm not destined to be happy

519
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:06,552
I can't bear this sight

520
00:55:09,014 --> 00:55:11,849
...and I can't oppose my king's orders

521
00:55:14,227 --> 00:55:15,769
Good bye

522
00:55:59,773 --> 00:56:05,611
Sita! My dear child!
Why are you suffering?

523
00:56:06,237 --> 00:56:09,656
Your husband, was scared of
being blamed and wished for fame

524
00:56:10,075 --> 00:56:13,952
So he lost you
He is an unlucky man

525
00:56:14,662 --> 00:56:20,250
People of Ayodhya who
blamed you are wretched

526
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:24,254
This earth can't bear such sinners

527
00:56:24,839 --> 00:56:29,051
They'll suffer
They'll suffer twice

528
00:56:29,803 --> 00:56:38,143
Though Rama's brothers are praising Sita
a pregnant lady, ready for fire test again

529
00:56:38,686 --> 00:56:42,898
...to fulfill his duty as a king,
Rama who abandoned Sita

530
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:48,153
...and believed the wicked words
of his people, so I'll curse them

531
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:57,496
Mother!

532
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:01,083
Mother! Be calm

533
00:57:04,379 --> 00:57:09,174
Mother! Don't curse my lord and my people

534
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:11,260
I can't endure it

535
00:57:11,344 --> 00:57:14,972
Who is your lord?
Is that cruel person your lord?

536
00:57:15,515 --> 00:57:18,684
Is it Rama who ordered you to jump
into the fire, taking the chastity test?

537
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:23,021
Is that wicked person who sent
his pregnant wife to the forest your lord?

538
00:57:24,524 --> 00:57:28,026
I can't keep quiet
if you blame my husband, my lord

539
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:31,447
I don't care you if you deride him

540
00:57:31,614 --> 00:57:33,991
Go away

541
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:40,289
You can't endure it
if I blame your husband

542
00:57:42,667 --> 00:57:46,920
I can't endure it
if you feel sad

543
00:57:48,548 --> 00:57:53,135
I give you my word
I won't deride your husband

544
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:55,888
You come with me to my abode

545
00:57:58,516 --> 00:58:05,355
If I come to my mother's home
blamed by my in-laws

546
00:58:05,523 --> 00:58:07,733
...it won't be good for you

547
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:15,032
After l beget the Raghuvamsa heir
I have to unite him with my lord

548
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:18,952
And l have to handover my child to him

549
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:23,457
Then only I can come to your abode

550
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:29,004
Then I'll hide in your lap
as your little child

551
00:58:30,882 --> 00:58:35,302
A mother who begets a girl child
should learn to endure

552
00:58:36,304 --> 00:58:41,141
No one can change your fate
Suffer it...endure it

553
00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:00,911
Jai Sri Ram!

554
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:06,041
Oh sage!

555
00:59:06,668 --> 00:59:09,461
Did you hear about this wonder?
Have you seen this frightful scene?

556
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:12,881
Rama is in Ayodhya
Sita is in the forest

557
00:59:12,966 --> 00:59:16,426
Their personal problem
is now known to all

558
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:20,180
Hanuman!

559
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:30,274
I felt very happy
when my lord got coronated

560
00:59:30,692 --> 00:59:36,321
I felt joyous
that Sita reached the shore

561
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:42,077
I heard the news
that Sita was blamed

562
00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:48,208
What can I do
to make Sita happy?

563
00:59:48,543 --> 00:59:54,298
Then I crossed the searf
and made them unite

564
00:59:54,507 --> 00:59:59,886
What should I do for this act?

565
01:00:00,013 --> 01:00:05,517
I can't oppose Sri Rama's orders

566
01:00:06,978 --> 01:00:15,068
I can't find a way for this
Advice me

567
01:00:21,618 --> 01:00:26,705
Mother Sita's troubles have started again

568
01:00:30,585 --> 01:00:34,338
So Sita and Rama's story is still going on

569
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:40,260
It'll be a happy ending
Let good things happen

570
01:00:42,555 --> 01:00:45,390
Have you come to serve your mother?

571
01:00:46,184 --> 01:00:49,645
I don't have such luck

572
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:55,400
To console the mother,
this is not kingdom of Lanka

573
01:00:55,693 --> 01:01:00,238
To fight with him, he is not a demon

574
01:01:00,615 --> 01:01:05,327
One side is Ramaiah
And other side is Sitamma

575
01:01:05,411 --> 01:01:09,873
With whom l can fight?
And whom do I console?

576
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:14,419
I don't know what to do
I need your advice

577
01:01:16,214 --> 01:01:18,799
Rama's feet protect everyone

578
01:01:19,842 --> 01:01:21,259
Be brave

579
01:01:21,594 --> 01:01:27,057
With this tribal disguise,
stay with mother in these hard times

580
01:01:27,183 --> 01:01:31,436
Make her laugh and be happy with
your songs and dance

581
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:33,689
That is your mission

582
01:01:33,898 --> 01:01:37,025
If she feels happy
the child will be healthy

583
01:01:37,402 --> 01:01:39,986
Good luck!
May you succeed

584
01:01:54,752 --> 01:01:57,254
Greetings, mother!

585
01:01:57,588 --> 01:02:01,383
Oh Goddess of the world! Tolerant Sita

586
01:02:01,592 --> 01:02:03,510
I am Valmiki

587
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:11,143
By singing Sita-Rama's virtuous history,
I wrote Sri Madga Ramayana epic

588
01:02:12,228 --> 01:02:15,939
I felt very happy that
I wrote the entire Ramayana

589
01:02:16,357 --> 01:02:19,609
But I've understood now
that it's an incomplete epic...

590
01:02:19,861 --> 01:02:23,947
...and God's decision is different

591
01:02:30,663 --> 01:02:38,211
Sita! Mother of world! Come to our
hermitage and make us happy

592
01:02:43,801 --> 01:02:48,472
Oh Sage! I am a married woman
and now I've been blamed

593
01:02:48,890 --> 01:02:50,807
Though I'm married
I am an orphan

594
01:02:51,684 --> 01:02:54,311
If I step into your virtuous soil...

595
01:02:54,687 --> 01:02:58,440
This earth will flourish
touched by the soles of your feet

596
01:03:00,485 --> 01:03:07,073
Will my name and family background
be kept a secret without other's knowledge?

597
01:03:07,241 --> 01:03:10,911
You have many names
No need worry about your name

598
01:03:11,454 --> 01:03:14,664
You are the incarnation
of Goddess Lakshmi

599
01:03:14,957 --> 01:03:17,584
We'll call you Lakshmi Devi

600
01:03:18,127 --> 01:03:19,503
Balaraju!

601
01:03:22,965 --> 01:03:25,008
He is your servant

602
01:03:25,343 --> 01:03:27,010
Consider him as your older son

603
01:03:27,178 --> 01:03:28,512
His name is Balaraju

604
01:03:28,846 --> 01:03:30,222
Balaraju...

605
01:03:30,515 --> 01:03:34,893
Oh hunter child! Go to our
hermitage in a second...

606
01:03:38,189 --> 01:03:40,190
- Then
- There...

607
01:03:43,569 --> 01:03:47,322
- There!
- He is a little fast

608
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:49,491
Son of the wind, makes things move fast

609
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:56,790
Listen dear! Go tell them that we must
make a hut for Lakshmi Devi

610
01:04:00,169 --> 01:04:04,297
Gurudeva is coming!
Disciples! Come with me

611
01:04:05,716 --> 01:04:08,760
Sages! Gurudeva is coming
Come fast

612
01:04:14,934 --> 01:04:16,518
Come ladies!

613
01:04:20,648 --> 01:04:22,065
Come here for a minute!

614
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:26,319
You both come and clean the hut

615
01:04:29,657 --> 01:04:31,783
You too join them

616
01:04:43,588 --> 01:04:45,922
My lord! Mother is coming

617
01:05:20,458 --> 01:05:27,088
Because of the good we have done
she has come here as our companion

618
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:29,174
She is Lakshmi Devi

619
01:05:31,510 --> 01:05:34,721
Her husband has gone
far away on a divine mission

620
01:05:35,306 --> 01:05:39,726
She'll stay in our hermitage
until he returns

621
01:05:40,603 --> 01:05:45,607
We must worship her as a Goddess,
treat her as a friend

622
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:53,073
Auspicious events like bangle ceremony
should happen happily

623
01:05:53,532 --> 01:05:54,699
Welcome dear!

624
01:06:11,759 --> 01:06:15,845
By this time, Mithila kingdom
will be rejoicing with trumpets

625
01:06:16,389 --> 01:06:21,685
Bangle ceremony of 3 daughters-in-laws
will be conducted in pomp and splendor

626
01:06:23,437 --> 01:06:27,565
But my eldest daughter-in-law
was not fortunate

627
01:06:32,321 --> 01:06:39,202
She wanted to stay in her husband's house
But alas she was sent to the forest

628
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:44,040
Ayodhya has become dark with gloom

629
01:07:15,156 --> 01:07:21,077
The bangle ceremony of Sita
is happening in grandeur

630
01:07:21,287 --> 01:07:27,417
Affection and happiness blossom...
Earth and sky feel joyous

631
01:07:27,501 --> 01:07:33,465
The kingdom of Kosala rejoices
and plays melodious tunes

632
01:07:33,549 --> 01:07:39,137
Full moon and spring together
bring delight to everyone

633
01:07:39,221 --> 01:07:45,393
Our Rama's beloved queen Sita
is going to be a mother

634
01:07:45,644 --> 01:07:51,816
The bangle ceremony of Sita
is happening with pomp and splendor

635
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:58,239
Affection and happiness bloom...
Earth and sky feel joyous

636
01:08:28,229 --> 01:08:31,231
Women flock together
and twirl the Morris-dance

637
01:08:31,315 --> 01:08:34,234
...offering saris and gifts

638
01:08:34,318 --> 01:08:37,403
He smiles, combs her hair tenderly
ornates her fore-head with kumkum

639
01:08:37,488 --> 01:08:40,323
He, her husband moves close to her

640
01:08:40,407 --> 01:08:43,493
Women flock together
and twirl the Morris-dance

641
01:08:43,577 --> 01:08:46,412
...offering saris and gifts

642
01:08:46,497 --> 01:08:49,624
He smiles, combs her hair tenderly
ornates her fore-head with kumkum

643
01:08:49,708 --> 01:08:52,919
He, her husband moves close to her

644
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:58,800
Kashmir sends baskets of saffron

645
01:08:58,968 --> 01:09:04,305
And musk is sent from Karnataka

646
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:10,270
Despite Sita's refusal, three sister-in-law
do not allow her to do any work

647
01:09:10,771 --> 01:09:16,943
The bangle ceremony of Sita
is happening in grandeur

648
01:09:17,027 --> 01:09:23,867
Showering affection and happiness...
Earth and sky feel joyous

649
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:44,262
Mother! Please come

650
01:10:26,597 --> 01:10:33,311
With affection, your delivery will happen
in your parent's home

651
01:10:33,395 --> 01:10:40,193
Accept the turmeric and kumkum
given by your husband's house

652
01:10:40,277 --> 01:10:47,033
Chanting Rama's name echoes here
Hearing it labour pain will vanish

653
01:10:47,117 --> 01:10:54,290
With prayers of mother and mother-in-law
mother and children will be safe

654
01:10:54,375 --> 01:11:01,214
With blessings of married women
all is well with you

655
01:11:01,298 --> 01:11:07,679
Though you have kith and kin
Now we are your relatives

656
01:11:07,763 --> 01:11:14,519
Wherever you are,
Rama protects yourf oh pretty lady!

657
01:11:14,603 --> 01:11:21,442
Bangle ceremony of Devi
brings high spirited joy

658
01:11:21,527 --> 01:11:28,074
Shower of affection and happiness...
fills the whole heart

659
01:11:28,242 --> 01:11:34,998
Noble women offer camphor
to this beautiful lady

660
01:11:35,165 --> 01:11:41,504
While singing the Vedas,
people in the hermitage bless her

661
01:11:41,588 --> 01:11:49,012
Beget a son, as he getting all pleasures

662
01:11:49,096 --> 01:11:56,060

Shower of affection and happiness...
fills the whole heart

664
01:12:24,465 --> 01:12:27,884
Greetings...greetings! I greet myself

665
01:12:28,260 --> 01:12:31,554
Why are you greeting yourself?

666
01:12:31,638 --> 01:12:33,097
What should I do, mother?

667
01:12:33,182 --> 01:12:36,809
When l greet anyone they will bless me

668
01:12:36,894 --> 01:12:39,520
They don't greet me

669
01:12:40,939 --> 01:12:42,982
Are you laughing, mother?

670
01:12:43,275 --> 01:12:47,111
Nice, If you laugh
you are like my mother?

671
01:12:47,279 --> 01:12:51,366
Shall I tell you a Gadha(mace)
to make you laugh more?

672
01:12:51,867 --> 01:12:53,743
It's Katha(Story), not Gadha(mace)

673
01:12:53,827 --> 01:12:55,078
That's why I get angry

674
01:12:55,162 --> 01:12:58,122
Before I tell a story
you'll find faults

675
01:12:58,749 --> 01:13:01,542
Okay, tell your story

676
01:13:02,461 --> 01:13:07,965
After the coronation of king Rama,
he got tired and went home

677
01:13:08,050 --> 01:13:10,343
and everyone went home

678
01:13:10,427 --> 01:13:15,765
...except Hanuman, he stayed behind

679
01:13:17,434 --> 01:13:22,146
Although Rama went to the bed room,
he went there and sat down

680
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:26,234
Everyone felt sleepy and yawned

681
01:13:26,318 --> 01:13:29,404
But Hanuman didn't move away from there

682
01:13:31,156 --> 01:13:32,740
Go to bed, Hanuman

683
01:13:32,825 --> 01:13:36,828
Who will take care of the lord
if I go from here?

684
01:13:36,912 --> 01:13:38,162
I'll take care of him

685
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:43,709
The services what you and
I do are different

686
01:13:43,836 --> 01:13:49,465
He'll get up suddenly and
complain of a headache...

687
01:13:49,550 --> 01:13:55,430
...and ask me to get some herbs
from Sanjeevini hill

688
01:13:55,514 --> 01:13:57,223
Can you bring them?

689
01:13:58,058 --> 01:14:00,977
I'll fly and bring them soon

690
01:14:01,186 --> 01:14:06,441
- You can't do that
- I see

691
01:14:18,203 --> 01:14:19,412
My lord!

692
01:14:21,123 --> 01:14:23,040
I can snap my fingers myself, Hanuman

693
01:14:23,125 --> 01:14:31,257
Elders say it is a sin to snap
for yourself when you yawn!

694
01:14:31,592 --> 01:14:35,303
I should snap if you yawn

695
01:14:35,971 --> 01:14:38,473
Then do one thing, Hanuman

696
01:14:38,557 --> 01:14:44,228
Not in this room,
go sit on that fort tower

697
01:14:44,313 --> 01:14:48,524
You snap when your lord yawns
everyone will listen

698
01:14:48,609 --> 01:14:51,027
- You'll be blessed accordingly
- Is it, mother?

699
01:14:55,491 --> 01:14:57,241
Jai Sri Ram!

700
01:15:00,579 --> 01:15:04,207
After sitting in the tower,
Hanuman had a doubt

701
01:15:04,958 --> 01:15:10,838
How will I know when Rama yawns?

702
01:15:12,799 --> 01:15:16,052
He started to snap non-stop

703
01:15:24,686 --> 01:15:28,314
There, Rama also got a doubt

704
01:15:28,398 --> 01:15:30,650
Do you know what he did?

705
01:15:30,734 --> 01:15:34,403
He too started to yawn without stopping

706
01:15:35,405 --> 01:15:42,453
How do you know that
he yawned there continuously?

707
01:15:42,538 --> 01:15:46,123
I heard this story from Gurudeva

708
01:15:55,133 --> 01:15:59,637
Move aside

709
01:16:19,366 --> 01:16:21,742
Let us prepare ourselves
by purifying from impure

710
01:16:22,494 --> 01:16:24,453
by removing all the stresses

711
01:16:25,372 --> 01:16:30,585
hindrance for learning
through submitting one self to the divine

712
01:16:36,341 --> 01:16:44,557
Mother! These twins are born in the most
auspicious time, luck favors them

713
01:16:44,683 --> 01:16:50,229
As they have been born in the hermitage
I'll name them with equivalent names

714
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:53,524
I am separating this
blade of grass into two

715
01:16:53,734 --> 01:17:00,906
This part will be called Kusa(former),
the other will be called Lava(latter)

716
01:17:01,033 --> 01:17:04,910
They'll grow together as Kusa and Lava

717
01:17:14,588 --> 01:17:16,255
My lord!

718
01:17:41,615 --> 01:17:43,658
Hey, come on

719
01:18:00,384 --> 01:18:06,180
You twins are like conch and wheel
He protects you always

720
01:18:06,264 --> 01:18:11,852
You are like flowers from Queen
Sita's garden, she protects you always

721
01:18:11,937 --> 01:18:17,608
If I tell Rama's story
you'll love to listen

722
01:18:17,693 --> 01:18:23,447
You'll sleep well
listening to his deeds

723
01:18:23,532 --> 01:18:28,786
They'll start crying
If we stop telling his deeds

724
01:18:29,454 --> 01:18:34,834
This is the King's elephant
It's always trustworthy

725
01:18:35,043 --> 01:18:40,798
This is the Queen Sita's elephant
It'll obey you

726
01:18:40,882 --> 01:18:46,429
Hail Rama...hail Lava Kusa

727
01:18:46,596 --> 01:18:52,977
Hail Sita...hail Lava Kusa

728
01:19:17,836 --> 01:19:33,309
Teacher is the form of
Gods Brahma, Vishnu, Siva

729
01:19:33,518 --> 01:19:41,650
...and Supreme God

730
01:19:41,860 --> 01:20:01,504
We pay respects to that teacher

731
01:20:01,755 --> 01:20:02,713
Victory to you

732
01:20:03,381 --> 01:20:09,553
Dear children! Have you memorized
Sri Madga Ramayana story

733
01:20:09,763 --> 01:20:11,555
...that you heard from me?

734
01:20:11,765 --> 01:20:15,726
- Have you understood it?
- Yes Gurudeva

735
01:20:15,852 --> 01:20:19,563
Is it a fictitious story
or did it happen in real life?

736
01:20:19,773 --> 01:20:22,650
Is there a great man
like him in this world?

737
01:20:28,740 --> 01:20:31,992
One day I asked the same question
to Sage Narada

738
01:20:32,077 --> 01:20:38,082
Who is in this world
with great qualities?

739
01:20:38,458 --> 01:20:44,421
Who in these days has good conduct?

740
01:20:44,506 --> 01:20:50,594
One who speaks the truth always
One who protects dharmas

741
01:20:50,679 --> 01:20:56,725
One who is always grateful
One who is brightest, like the Sun

742
01:20:56,810 --> 01:21:02,731
One who looks after everyone with love
One who is very kind

743
01:21:02,816 --> 01:21:09,738
Who is it?
Who is it?

744
01:21:10,448 --> 01:21:13,242
Then Naradha answered me in this way

745
01:21:13,493 --> 01:21:19,331
There is a person in this world
as equal to the sound 'Omkaram'

746
01:21:19,708 --> 01:21:25,546
There is a person
praised by one and by all

747
01:21:25,755 --> 01:21:28,716
Like a hunter, having great qualities

748
01:21:28,884 --> 01:21:31,719
Like a friend, having good conduct

749
01:21:31,803 --> 01:21:34,847
Like the Moonrf having a cheerful face

750
01:21:34,931 --> 01:21:37,975
The truthful man on this earth...

751
01:21:38,059 --> 01:21:46,442
...is Dasaratha's son, the kind personrf
Janaki's husband

752
01:21:47,277 --> 01:21:59,538
Sri Rama

753
01:22:01,833 --> 01:22:05,336
He is the hero in our Ramayana story

754
01:22:05,837 --> 01:22:09,757
Ramayanam means Rama+Ayanam

755
01:22:09,841 --> 01:22:12,593
...the path taken by Rama

756
01:22:12,677 --> 01:22:15,846
It means...the virtuous laws
on how conduct ourselves

757
01:22:15,931 --> 01:22:20,809
...what should we do
and what we shouldn't

758
01:22:21,895 --> 01:22:25,940
If we do not surrender to the wishes
which take us to the wrong path

759
01:22:26,024 --> 01:22:29,777
If we do not behave like
animals and demons...

760
01:22:29,986 --> 01:22:33,697
If the people in this world
want to be happy...

761
01:22:34,157 --> 01:22:39,703
This virtuous story tells us the laws
and the civilized rules, we must follow

762
01:22:39,955 --> 01:22:45,376
Tell me what you have learnt
from the characters in the Ramayanam

763
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:47,962
King Dasaratha stands for his promise

764
01:22:48,046 --> 01:22:50,589
Because of the boon he gave
to his wife Kaikeyi,

765
01:22:50,674 --> 01:22:55,886
...he sent his beloved son to the forest

766
01:22:56,054 --> 01:22:58,222
He lost his life unable to bear that pain

767
01:22:58,390 --> 01:23:03,686
It means even if we lose our life
we should keep up our promise

768
01:23:04,562 --> 01:23:08,399
- His son Rama
- He always spoke the truth

769
01:23:08,566 --> 01:23:11,276
One arrow, one word, one wife

770
01:23:11,361 --> 01:23:14,613
To save his father's dignity,
he sacrificed his kingdom

771
01:23:14,698 --> 01:23:17,157
...went to the forest and
suffered many troubles

772
01:23:17,242 --> 01:23:20,995
It means...we should respect
our parents always

773
01:23:21,204 --> 01:23:22,621
Next Sita devi

774
01:23:22,831 --> 01:23:24,581
She was a virtuous woman

775
01:23:24,708 --> 01:23:28,585
When her husband was sent in exile,
she abandoned her royal comforts

776
01:23:28,670 --> 01:23:32,715
...and followed him as a shadow
to the forest and shared his suffering

777
01:23:32,799 --> 01:23:36,635
Though the demon Ravana abducted
and imprisoned her in Lanka

778
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:41,515
Though he offered her the queen's status
and even threatened to kill her

779
01:23:41,599 --> 01:23:42,725
...she didn't change her mind

780
01:23:42,809 --> 01:23:46,103
She looked down at that demon
as grass to be trampled

781
01:23:48,606 --> 01:23:50,065
She believed in Rama

782
01:23:50,483 --> 01:23:56,822
She fasted, meditating only his name
trusting that he'd come and save her

783
01:23:57,198 --> 01:24:01,243
She overcame all trials and troubles
and united with her husband

784
01:24:02,787 --> 01:24:03,787
What about Ravana?

785
01:24:03,872 --> 01:24:07,166
He got destroyed
for desiring another's wife

786
01:24:07,250 --> 01:24:10,961
Not only him, but also his kith and kin
and kingdom got destroyed

787
01:24:11,463 --> 01:24:16,467
Rama's story,
we should learn the affection

788
01:24:16,551 --> 01:24:18,302
...between father and son, husband and wife

789
01:24:18,386 --> 01:24:21,430
...the love and respect amongst brothers

790
01:24:21,514 --> 01:24:24,808
Lakshmana went to the forest
to serve his brother

791
01:24:24,893 --> 01:24:29,313
Though he was offered the kingdom,
he rejected it and was Rama's servant

792
01:24:29,397 --> 01:24:34,985
Those brothers are great
We all must follow their path

793
01:24:35,111 --> 01:24:39,114
You should spread this
virtuous story worldwide

794
01:24:39,324 --> 01:24:42,159
Elders, youngsters and everyone
should listen to this story

795
01:24:42,327 --> 01:24:44,536
You should sing and make them sing

796
01:24:44,746 --> 01:24:47,873
Everyone should follow the path
shown by Lord Rama

797
01:24:48,124 --> 01:24:50,375
People must build a temple in their heart

798
01:24:50,710 --> 01:24:54,630
Rama and Sita should worshiped there

799
01:24:54,923 --> 01:24:56,548
They should live in their hearts

800
01:25:01,805 --> 01:25:04,723
Sing one more time

801
01:25:15,693 --> 01:25:18,237

Dasratha was a king of Ayodhya
His virtuous wives were three

814
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:37,733
The king performed
sacrifices to get children

815
01:26:37,984 --> 01:26:43,113
...along with queens
Kousalyarf Sumitra, and Kaikeyi

816
01:26:43,364 --> 01:26:48,160
They blessed him with sons

817
01:26:48,369 --> 01:26:53,749
They were Rama, Lakshmana,
Bharatha and Shatrugna

818
01:26:53,958 --> 01:26:59,087
Raghu dynasty was started
to flourish happily

819
01:26:59,297 --> 01:27:01,882
Listen to the story of Sita Ram,
the epic

820
01:27:02,050 --> 01:27:06,887

See his Divine antics

822
01:27:21,236 --> 01:27:26,365
King Dasaratha forgot time pass by
his dear child, Rama was the apple of his eye

823
01:27:26,616 --> 01:27:32,120
Sage Kausika came to his palace

824
01:27:32,205 --> 01:27:37,376
And asked him to send Rama
with him to protect his sacrifice

825
01:27:37,585 --> 01:27:48,178
He taught Rama to use weapons
He killed demoness Thaataki

826
01:27:48,471 --> 01:27:53,809
The sacrifice was successful
and the Sage felt happy

827
01:27:54,018 --> 01:28:01,984
After that, the victorious Rama
visited Mithila kingdom

828
01:28:24,382 --> 01:28:29,678
The bow of Siva was displayed
and the new bride stood aside

829
01:28:29,929 --> 01:28:35,142
The guardian and protector,
Rama was there

830
01:28:35,310 --> 01:28:40,647
Feast to the eyes
Rama's handsome face

831
01:28:40,857 --> 01:28:45,986
Good luck favored him
to make him taste victory

832
01:28:46,154 --> 01:28:57,039
The handsome man took the bow
broke it without difficulty

833
01:28:57,290 --> 01:29:03,211
The bride, with garland
moved towards him

834
01:29:13,473 --> 01:29:20,937
Proclaiming that Janaki would move
like his shadow

835
01:29:21,105 --> 01:29:28,278
...King Janaka gave her hand to Rama

836
01:29:28,529 --> 01:29:35,911
Sweet melody filled the air

837
01:29:35,995 --> 01:29:43,210
She filled Rama into her heart

838
01:29:43,419 --> 01:29:50,884
Blessed were the couple
never to be parted

839
01:29:51,052 --> 01:29:58,183
She wedded that brave man

840
01:29:58,518 --> 01:30:06,775
and felt very happy

841
01:30:07,276 --> 01:30:09,903

See his Divine antics

844
01:30:22,792 --> 01:30:29,881
Little warriors! You've learnt to use
weapons which is a part of archery

845
01:30:30,258 --> 01:30:33,677
I've taught you how to protect
the country and punish your enemy

846
01:30:33,845 --> 01:30:39,182
Now I'll teach you the remaining part,
all about using elements

847
01:30:39,267 --> 01:30:42,144
- Is it more powerful than learning
about weapons? - Is it different?

848
01:30:42,311 --> 01:30:47,649
People who have strength, and eye power
will fight with help of weapons

849
01:30:48,401 --> 01:30:51,445
Like arrow, sword, mace and spear

850
01:30:51,737 --> 01:30:55,323
But elements have magical powers

851
01:30:55,408 --> 01:30:58,285
In the education of elements
wind, fire, water, air

852
01:30:58,369 --> 01:31:03,165
...are used as weapons
with magical powers

853
01:31:03,249 --> 01:31:10,589
I'll teach you how to use
all the magical weapons

854
01:31:10,882 --> 01:31:12,132
Learn it

855
01:31:13,509 --> 01:31:22,142
The is the Fire weapon,
it emits flames and makes into ashes

856
01:31:23,478 --> 01:31:32,527
The is the Water weapon,
it rises like billows and submerges

857
01:31:33,446 --> 01:31:41,620
This is the Wind weapon
it swirlsrf moves fast and blows vigorously

858
01:31:43,456 --> 01:31:51,379
This is the Brahma's weapon which will
arrest whoever hides in any direction

859
01:31:51,923 --> 01:31:56,426
These are the divine weapons

860
01:32:00,306 --> 01:32:06,228
INTERMISSION

861
01:32:12,902 --> 01:32:19,491
Son! You are not taking care of the people

862
01:32:19,742 --> 01:32:23,828
...for whom you abandoned
your beloved wife Sita

863
01:32:24,413 --> 01:32:27,541
There is no peace and happiness
either at home or the kingdom

864
01:32:29,001 --> 01:32:34,965
Your sacrifice will have meaning
only if you can rule with a free mind

865
01:32:35,424 --> 01:32:40,345
Mother! Sage Vasishta has come

866
01:32:40,596 --> 01:32:43,348
He wants to meet the king

867
01:32:46,852 --> 01:32:55,068
Get up, Rama! Go and do your duty

868
01:32:56,946 --> 01:32:58,321
Get up!

869
01:33:03,286 --> 01:33:06,121
May you be happy in your married life

870
01:33:07,790 --> 01:33:09,165
May you live long!

871
01:33:12,461 --> 01:33:14,879
You are Ramarf
the protector of dharmas

872
01:33:15,006 --> 01:33:17,507
Even your enemy Maaricha praised you

873
01:33:18,342 --> 01:33:23,555
Sage Viswamitra praised you
that you are a sage beyond penance

874
01:33:23,806 --> 01:33:27,851
Oh my lord! No one needs to advise you

875
01:33:27,977 --> 01:33:31,313
You look like the Sun,
swallowed by planet Rahu

876
01:33:31,981 --> 01:33:33,607
Let your ill-fate perish

877
01:33:33,899 --> 01:33:38,320
My brother should shine
like the mid-day Sun

878
01:33:38,529 --> 01:33:43,742
It is not affecting you alone
but your whole kingdom

879
01:33:43,909 --> 01:33:44,868
She is right

880
01:33:45,745 --> 01:33:48,079
It is said that people
follow the king's path

881
01:33:48,914 --> 01:33:52,751
Your people are as much in gloom as you!

882
01:33:52,918 --> 01:33:57,213
There's no peace, no pleasures
and no happiness in the kingdom

883
01:33:57,590 --> 01:34:00,300
People are suffering because of poverty

884
01:34:00,509 --> 01:34:06,973
You are making the people suffer
for whom you abandoned Sita

885
01:34:07,183 --> 01:34:09,643
This path is not right for you

886
01:34:10,770 --> 01:34:15,649
I've lost my beloved and virtuous wife

887
01:34:16,651 --> 01:34:18,860
What else can I do?

888
01:34:18,944 --> 01:34:24,157
If you get Lord Siva's blessings
you'll overcome the troubles

889
01:34:24,575 --> 01:34:26,993
Performing a sacrifice is the only way
to regain peace and prosperity

890
01:34:27,203 --> 01:34:35,085
Yes Rama, in the past, when your father
and I did not have children...

891
01:34:35,378 --> 01:34:41,716
our sage convinced us
to perform a sacrificing to get children

892
01:34:41,926 --> 01:34:45,637
Because of that sacrifice, we got
Rama, Lakshmana, Bharatha and Shatrugna

893
01:34:45,721 --> 01:34:47,013
And again today...

894
01:34:47,098 --> 01:34:53,978
...they are wishing to perform 'Ashvamedha'
for the happiness of our kingdom

895
01:34:54,146 --> 01:34:58,900
Sage Vasishta consented

896
01:35:00,778 --> 01:35:07,283
Sister! Because l've lost my wife,
I'm not eligible to perform the sacrifice

897
01:35:07,827 --> 01:35:11,329
- Don't you know that?
- It's not a problem

898
01:35:11,747 --> 01:35:14,833
If you consent...

899
01:35:15,042 --> 01:35:18,837
...we can perform your 2nd marriage

900
01:35:19,255 --> 01:35:23,925
Sister! I request you
Never say that word again

901
01:35:24,385 --> 01:35:26,010
Don't even say it in jest

902
01:35:26,554 --> 01:35:28,930
This Rama will always be
'one woman one man'

903
01:35:29,056 --> 01:35:31,057
Relax

904
01:35:32,226 --> 01:35:36,062
Your sister had the welfare
of the kingdom in mind

905
01:35:40,568 --> 01:35:45,196
There is an option
it doesn't trouble to your prayers

906
01:35:46,282 --> 01:35:50,410
We can perform the sacrifice,
with an idol of Sita made in silver

907
01:35:50,494 --> 01:35:54,080
...and placing it in your wife's place

908
01:35:54,165 --> 01:35:58,126
Yes Rama, it is approved by the laws

909
01:36:12,725 --> 01:36:14,768
Listen to us! Go back

910
01:36:14,852 --> 01:36:17,896
King is taking rest
Stop here

911
01:36:17,980 --> 01:36:19,355
Listen to us

912
01:36:24,111 --> 01:36:27,989
My lord! King Rama!

913
01:36:28,073 --> 01:36:29,574
My lord! Listen to our woes

914
01:36:29,700 --> 01:36:32,994
Forgive our sins and faults

915
01:36:33,913 --> 01:36:35,622
Forgive us, my lord

916
01:36:35,831 --> 01:36:42,003
My dear people!
There is nothing to forgive

917
01:36:42,505 --> 01:36:45,924
Let it be good or bad,
its my responsibility

918
01:36:46,008 --> 01:36:48,176
If there is any fault
it belongs to me

919
01:36:48,302 --> 01:36:50,428
No, my lord! Not at all

920
01:36:50,513 --> 01:36:51,971
We are to blame

921
01:36:52,097 --> 01:36:54,057
All mistakes and blunders
belong to us alone

922
01:36:54,183 --> 01:36:57,477
Knowingly or unknowingly in ignorance

923
01:36:57,561 --> 01:37:01,439
...we have sinned blaming
our innocent queen!

924
01:37:01,607 --> 01:37:04,317
- We are cursed
- And suffering for our sins

925
01:37:04,401 --> 01:37:06,152
We've lost happiness

926
01:37:06,237 --> 01:37:11,157
Our lives have been destroyed
after our mother, Sita left Ayodhya

927
01:37:11,242 --> 01:37:15,578
We got punished
for what we did

928
01:37:15,996 --> 01:37:19,749
Forgive us and accept our repentance

929
01:37:19,834 --> 01:37:23,461
Yes, my lord!
Don't refuse, accept our apology

930
01:37:23,587 --> 01:37:27,257
We heard that our mother
queen Sita's image is being made as a doll

931
01:37:27,383 --> 01:37:29,467
She'll visit our homes in this form

932
01:37:29,552 --> 01:37:33,137
We heard that Sita's silver doll
is getting ready for the sacrifice

933
01:37:33,222 --> 01:37:39,644
Don't take gold
from your king's treasury

934
01:37:39,770 --> 01:37:45,358
Take all our gold and craft her idol

935
01:37:45,901 --> 01:37:47,110
Make it beautiful

936
01:37:47,194 --> 01:37:49,654
Fulfill our wish

937
01:37:50,197 --> 01:37:52,323
We'll even lose our life for her sake

938
01:37:52,616 --> 01:37:56,828
She will protect us and take care
of all of us by blessing us

939
01:37:56,912 --> 01:38:01,374
We'll obey you always

940
01:38:02,710 --> 01:38:06,671
May you have a happy married life!

941
01:38:18,267 --> 01:38:25,648
My lord! Forgive us

942
01:38:32,323 --> 01:38:37,243
Lava Kusa! You yourselves asked
what l wanted you to do

943
01:38:37,369 --> 01:38:45,168
I wished that you should sing
Valmiki's Ramayan in front of lord Rama

944
01:38:45,336 --> 01:38:46,920
Meanwhile you asked me

945
01:38:47,296 --> 01:38:50,965
May you be victorious and prosperous

946
01:38:51,634 --> 01:38:54,177
I bless you to regain your glory
that you rightfully deserve

947
01:38:56,388 --> 01:38:59,641
Sage Bharadvaj will accompany you
and show you the way to Ayodhya

948
01:38:59,725 --> 01:39:02,310
Gurudeva! Won't you come with us?

949
01:39:02,561 --> 01:39:03,770
You go

950
01:39:04,772 --> 01:39:09,359
You are very brave
You don't need my protection

951
01:39:10,653 --> 01:39:13,947
Go bravely and reach your destination

952
01:39:15,240 --> 01:39:17,408
You will meet with success and happiness

953
01:39:18,202 --> 01:39:21,913
Mother of our world! Mahalakshmi!

954
01:39:22,122 --> 01:39:23,665
You agree, right?

955
01:39:57,825 --> 01:40:05,206
It is ill-fate that the king's sons
are meeting their father as singers

956
01:40:05,958 --> 01:40:11,379
Stop being playful
Unite the family which is separated

957
01:40:22,516 --> 01:40:25,727
Meet King Rama and get his blessings

958
01:40:40,409 --> 01:40:43,619
Look at him on my behalf too!

959
01:40:50,669 --> 01:40:53,629
- Don't be mischievous
- We won't

960
01:40:53,714 --> 01:40:56,382
- Don't quarrel with anyone
- We won't

961
01:40:56,550 --> 01:40:59,469
- Don't accept any gifts
- We won't

962
01:40:59,553 --> 01:41:02,388
- Don't stop being mischievous
- We won't

963
01:41:11,648 --> 01:41:17,403
Hear Ramayana,
story of Lord Rama

964
01:41:22,743 --> 01:41:28,414
Hear this Divine classicrf
story of Lord Rama

965
01:41:28,540 --> 01:41:33,961
Filled with sacrifices
justice so fair

966
01:41:34,046 --> 01:41:39,509
Love and affection beyond compare

967
01:41:39,593 --> 01:41:45,014
Every character with virtues so rare

968
01:41:45,099 --> 01:41:50,436
Listen to Ramayana,
story of Lord Rama

969
01:41:50,687 --> 01:41:56,567
Listen to this epic,
story of Lord Rama

970
01:42:10,415 --> 01:42:13,960
Coronation of Lord Rama

971
01:42:21,051 --> 01:42:24,512
Coronation of God Rama

972
01:42:24,680 --> 01:42:27,682
Dasaratha prepared for
the coronation of his son

973
01:42:28,058 --> 01:42:31,519
The entire kingdom rejoiced
with frolic and fun

974
01:42:31,687 --> 01:42:36,190
Boons given to Kaikeyi
brought troubles and tears

975
01:42:38,819 --> 01:42:45,491
She cruelly sent Rama
to the forest for 14 years

976
01:42:45,659 --> 01:42:49,412
And he was sent on exile

977
01:42:49,580 --> 01:42:56,586
And he willingly went with a smile

978
01:43:20,777 --> 01:43:28,784
He set foot into the forest
leaving his palatial house

979
01:43:28,869 --> 01:43:36,792
His queen left the comforts
accompanied her spouse

980
01:43:36,919 --> 01:43:44,759
Respecting the King's words, he left,
son, for the sake of his father

981
01:43:44,843 --> 01:43:52,683
Wife for the sake of her husband
Lakshmana, followed his brother

982
01:43:52,893 --> 01:43:58,606
People protested and wept

983
01:44:03,737 --> 01:44:11,744
Rama wanted the promise to be kept
Sita his shadow, faithful wife

984
01:44:11,828 --> 01:44:17,625
Lakshman went to share their strife

985
01:44:17,834 --> 01:44:23,756
And Ayodhya was engulfed
in gloom and despair

986
01:44:23,882 --> 01:44:30,304
And Ayodhya was filled
with darkness everywhere

987
01:44:30,472 --> 01:44:35,935
Hear Ramayana,
story of Lord Rama

988
01:44:36,103 --> 01:44:43,067
Listen to Ramayana,
story of God Rama

989
01:44:45,279 --> 01:44:48,072
Madam! Greetings to you

990
01:44:48,407 --> 01:44:49,699
What is the matter?

991
01:44:50,075 --> 01:44:56,414
Some artistes are singing our Rama's story
near Sri Parameswari temple

992
01:44:57,124 --> 01:44:58,666
Rama's story!?

993
01:44:59,626 --> 01:45:03,713
- What is that?
- Yes mother, it is our Rama's story

994
01:45:04,381 --> 01:45:07,425
Two children, not even 10 years old

995
01:45:07,634 --> 01:45:12,346
Wearing anklets, dancing nicely,
playing Tambura

996
01:45:12,556 --> 01:45:14,265
And singing his story

997
01:45:14,599 --> 01:45:18,519
I cried when I listened to it
It was so nice

998
01:45:18,645 --> 01:45:24,066
- Is it? Then bring them here
- Okay madam!

999
01:45:31,408 --> 01:45:35,578
Saga of Sita Rama

1000
01:45:36,621 --> 01:45:39,582
Legend of Sita Rama

1001
01:45:39,791 --> 01:45:42,293
If we recite the sacred chants
our lives become pure

1002
01:45:42,502 --> 01:45:45,046
If we listen to the holy chants
our sins vanish for sure

1003
01:45:45,172 --> 01:45:47,882
Every word is set to rhyme and rhythm

1004
01:45:47,966 --> 01:45:51,177
Four Vedas that emerge from it
Our world happiness-anthem

1005
01:45:51,303 --> 01:45:58,100
Written by Sage Valmiki the great
Sacred fable of God Incarnate

1006
01:45:59,102 --> 01:46:12,656
Rama stayed in the forest with his wife

1007
01:46:12,741 --> 01:46:16,160
With his brother
to protect day and night

1008
01:46:16,370 --> 01:46:20,289
Forest rejoiced the endearing sight

1009
01:46:24,669 --> 01:46:29,298
Ravana's sister Soorpanaka
fell in love with the noble Lord

1010
01:46:29,466 --> 01:46:34,136
He advised her to leave
She crossed her limits and her guard

1011
01:46:34,221 --> 01:46:38,766
Lakshmana stepped in
and cut her nose and ears

1012
01:46:38,975 --> 01:46:45,898
That demoness left angrily
to complain to her brother with tears

1013
01:46:48,652 --> 01:46:51,904
Ravana appeared disguised as a beggar

1014
01:46:52,155 --> 01:46:55,574
Maaricha became a magic deer

1015
01:46:55,784 --> 01:47:00,830
Rama went after the deer
to satisfy the wish of his wife dear

1016
01:47:00,997 --> 01:47:06,210
Ravana waited for the right moment
abducted Sita as a punishment

1017
01:47:06,420 --> 01:47:09,755
He imprisoned Sita in Lanka,
in the middle of the sea

1018
01:47:09,923 --> 01:47:14,802
with she-demons to guard her permanently

1019
01:47:18,765 --> 01:47:25,521
Tears from Sita's eyes overflowed

1020
01:47:26,356 --> 01:47:33,737
Hererf Rama's anguish multiplied

1021
01:47:34,698 --> 01:47:39,869
Calling out to Sita...Sita

1022
01:47:39,995 --> 01:47:47,668
Calling Sita...Sita...a mere echo

1023
01:47:47,919 --> 01:47:58,637
As his voice reached the sky
Sita's husband in sorrow

1024
01:48:02,934 --> 01:48:06,854
Hanuman, made Rama befriend
the monkey-king Sugreevarf

1025
01:48:07,022 --> 01:48:11,275
Crossed the sea,
reached Lanka and met Sita

1026
01:48:11,485 --> 01:48:15,779
Showed Rama's ring as identity
assured her of liberty

1027
01:48:15,989 --> 01:48:20,117
He burnt Lanka, got Sita's jewel
to Rama as proof of his travel

1028
01:48:20,202 --> 01:48:24,788
From start to end he narrated
all that he saw and how he retaliated!

1029
01:48:28,960 --> 01:48:34,507
Army of monkeys built tirelessly
stone bridge to Lanka over the sea

1030
01:48:35,550 --> 01:48:40,888
Then war took place,
Rama killed Ravana and his race

1031
01:48:42,140 --> 01:48:48,771
He reached Ashoka garden and
set eyes on his wife

1032
01:48:48,980 --> 01:49:01,283
Rama, who faced many troubles
to save Sita from all this strife

1033
01:49:01,576 --> 01:49:13,796
...as soon as Sita reached his side
to walk on fire he did decide

1034
01:49:13,964 --> 01:49:21,095
Why did He behave in this way?
For whom was this fire-play?

1035
01:49:26,560 --> 01:49:32,940
What was the reason for his action?
To satisfy whose question?

1036
01:49:33,024 --> 01:49:39,280
Chastity test for Rama's wife,
the flawless!?

1037
01:49:39,364 --> 01:49:45,452
Fire test for this Ayodhya princess!?

1038
01:49:45,537 --> 01:49:51,750
Virtuous test for daughter-in-law
of Dasaratha!?

1039
01:49:51,835 --> 01:49:58,007
Fidelity test for daughter
of king Janaka!?

1040
01:49:58,133 --> 01:50:04,430
To the soul of Rama
or to the body of Sita

1041
01:50:04,514 --> 01:50:10,853
To Sun lineage
or the world at large

1042
01:50:10,937 --> 01:50:17,026
For whom is this test my Lord?
Why this test! Oh God!?

1043
01:50:17,110 --> 01:50:21,905
Lord Rama

1044
01:50:22,115 --> 01:50:26,201
It's enough
Stop it

1045
01:50:27,120 --> 01:50:28,287
Mother

1046
01:50:43,928 --> 01:50:45,429
Go ahead, sing

1047
01:50:49,976 --> 01:50:59,568
Sita jumped into the fire
in quiet dignity though disgraced

1048
01:50:59,653 --> 01:51:04,490
after knowing the truth
the world felt ashamed

1049
01:51:04,574 --> 01:51:09,161
while the directions vibrated
The fire God proclaimed

1050
01:51:09,245 --> 01:51:15,167
Sita is a Virtuous woman
The world praised and acclaimed

1051
01:51:16,294 --> 01:51:21,215
Rama proved to the world Sita's purity

1052
01:51:21,299 --> 01:51:25,886
And returned to Ayodhya
with his chaste lady

1053
01:51:26,054 --> 01:51:31,642
Returned, Rama along with Sita

1054
01:51:53,915 --> 01:51:57,418
Sri Rama...Rama
Chanting His name makes us pure

1055
01:51:57,502 --> 01:52:02,631
His name conveys
kindness, affection, courage for sure

1056
01:52:02,716 --> 01:52:07,761
Rama, accept please
greetings of your devotees

1057
01:52:07,846 --> 01:52:11,098
Sumitra's beloved off-spring

1058
01:52:11,182 --> 01:52:17,771
Heir of Sun dynasty
Husband of Janaki

1059
01:52:18,022 --> 01:52:27,030
We salute Thee for everything!

1060
01:52:36,916 --> 01:52:41,044
Dear children! Where do you live?

1061
01:52:42,088 --> 01:52:45,174
Where did you learn this Ramayana story?

1062
01:52:46,009 --> 01:52:47,926
Who is your master?

1063
01:52:48,011 --> 01:52:51,889
King! Valmiki is our master

1064
01:52:52,015 --> 01:52:54,308
He taught us

1065
01:52:54,392 --> 01:52:58,645
He enlightened us and wrote this epic

1066
01:52:58,730 --> 01:53:02,816
We are staying in the hermitage
near Tamasa river

1067
01:53:03,818 --> 01:53:04,985
I see!

1068
01:53:06,196 --> 01:53:08,614
You are very young!

1069
01:53:09,908 --> 01:53:12,493
You've been in the hermitage long enough

1070
01:53:12,911 --> 01:53:17,331
You children! Stay with us in Ayodhya

1071
01:53:17,415 --> 01:53:22,211
And make us happy
singing story of Rama everyday

1072
01:53:22,295 --> 01:53:27,382
- What about our mother?
- Our mother cannot live alone without us

1073
01:53:27,467 --> 01:53:32,554
We have just come to meet you
and get your blessing, King Rama

1074
01:53:32,639 --> 01:53:34,723
Now we won't stay here for a moment longer

1075
01:53:36,392 --> 01:53:38,811
How can children live here
leaving their mother alone?

1076
01:53:38,895 --> 01:53:39,895
Yes brother!

1077
01:53:40,021 --> 01:53:44,107
All pleasures are fruitless
if the children are not with their mother

1078
01:53:47,320 --> 01:53:52,241
Your mother who begot sons
like you is virtuous

1079
01:53:53,159 --> 01:53:58,372
Seeing you and
listening to your sweet voice

1080
01:53:59,541 --> 01:54:02,918
A new feeling, plays in my heart

1081
01:54:03,086 --> 01:54:06,338
My heart is not willing
to bid farewell to you

1082
01:54:09,342 --> 01:54:11,009
But you have to go

1083
01:54:11,928 --> 01:54:13,178
It's okay

1084
01:54:13,847 --> 01:54:19,101
At least accept our gifts and jewels

1085
01:54:19,894 --> 01:54:24,648
We live in the hermitage
We don't need jewels

1086
01:54:24,732 --> 01:54:26,692
My master won't accept it

1087
01:54:26,776 --> 01:54:33,031
Our mother warned us
not to accept gifts from anyone

1088
01:54:35,493 --> 01:54:40,539
- All we should do is meet Rama
- Our lives will be blessed

1089
01:54:40,665 --> 01:54:42,791
Only one thing remains

1090
01:54:42,876 --> 01:54:46,211
Ask me without hesitation

1091
01:54:46,296 --> 01:54:48,130
We need our mother

1092
01:54:50,341 --> 01:54:52,217
We want to see mother Sita

1093
01:54:52,302 --> 01:54:55,929
Like Siva Parvathy, Sita and Rama are one

1094
01:54:56,014 --> 01:54:59,516
We got to see only one half

1095
01:55:05,356 --> 01:55:11,612
It is our wish to see Sita Rama together
and get their blessings

1096
01:55:11,696 --> 01:55:17,284
- Our lives will be fulfilled
- Our mother will be happy and rejoice

1097
01:55:27,128 --> 01:55:31,673
My lord!

1098
01:55:32,717 --> 01:55:36,303
Mother! He is walking away
with a grim face

1099
01:55:36,387 --> 01:55:38,055
Is he angry with us?

1100
01:55:38,222 --> 01:55:43,060
Shouldn't we see 'mother Sita'?
is it because, we are from forest?

1101
01:55:43,227 --> 01:55:45,228
Forests are not familiar to him

1102
01:55:45,980 --> 01:55:48,315
He was also exiled in the forest

1103
01:55:48,983 --> 01:55:51,401
Have we sinned?

1104
01:55:52,070 --> 01:55:55,906
When a sinner's brother sought his help
he protected him

1105
01:55:55,990 --> 01:56:00,577
He is very kind, even if Ravana seeks
his help he will forgive him

1106
01:56:00,662 --> 01:56:04,164
Why mother? Why did he get angry?

1107
01:56:04,248 --> 01:56:06,667
What sin did we commit?

1108
01:56:09,921 --> 01:56:15,050
It is not your sin
It is our ill-fate

1109
01:56:16,302 --> 01:56:21,431
It is not possible for you to see Sita

1110
01:56:22,100 --> 01:56:25,185
- She is not here
- Why?

1111
01:56:25,269 --> 01:56:29,022
Where would she go,
without living with him?

1112
01:56:29,107 --> 01:56:33,193
- Somewhere, may be in the forest
- Forest!?

1113
01:56:33,277 --> 01:56:35,946
Yes, in the forest

1114
01:56:36,698 --> 01:56:43,996
We sent our Sita out
because someone blamed her

1115
01:56:44,163 --> 01:56:48,834
We abandoned a pregnant lady
considering it as a king's duty

1116
01:56:49,252 --> 01:56:53,088
It is our fate
We are unlucky

1117
01:56:53,381 --> 01:56:54,589
Hari...Hari

1118
01:56:54,674 --> 01:56:56,216
- Terrible...
- Atrocious

1119
01:56:56,300 --> 01:56:58,385
Is Rama such a cruel man?

1120
01:56:59,387 --> 01:57:02,973
Did he send his wife
who believed in him to the forest?

1121
01:57:03,141 --> 01:57:06,852
Our master wrote the Ramayana
Is it for this cruel person?

1122
01:57:06,936 --> 01:57:08,437
He must have been aware of this too

1123
01:57:08,521 --> 01:57:11,523
Come, let's banish
this king and his kingdom

1124
01:57:11,607 --> 01:57:12,607
Come, let's go

1125
01:57:20,283 --> 01:57:22,784
Mother! The brothers are returning

1126
01:57:39,385 --> 01:57:40,802
Why do you look like that?

1127
01:57:41,846 --> 01:57:43,346
Are you tired?

1128
01:57:45,266 --> 01:57:47,184
May be you roamed a lot?

1129
01:57:52,356 --> 01:57:54,316
Drink this water

1130
01:58:07,663 --> 01:58:09,664
Have you seen Rama?

1131
01:58:13,920 --> 01:58:15,420
Is he fine?

1132
01:58:15,505 --> 01:58:19,174
Of course, he is very happy

1133
01:58:19,258 --> 01:58:23,386
He is alone happy
but rest of the family is sad

1134
01:58:23,721 --> 01:58:26,223
Why do you say that?

1135
01:58:26,307 --> 01:58:27,224
Don't ask me anything

1136
01:58:27,308 --> 01:58:29,226
He is a king for name sake

1137
01:58:29,310 --> 01:58:30,977
But his mind is like a demon

1138
01:58:31,395 --> 01:58:35,107
We went there with great joy
prayed to him with devotion

1139
01:58:35,191 --> 01:58:36,316
We sang the story with love

1140
01:58:36,400 --> 01:58:42,781
At last we knew that he abandoned
his wife for the sake of his kingdom

1141
01:58:43,866 --> 01:58:50,372
We knew that he was very cruel
and sent his pregnant wife to the forest

1142
01:58:50,456 --> 01:58:52,290
How could he do that?

1143
01:58:52,375 --> 01:58:54,209
We got angry when we knew that

1144
01:58:54,293 --> 01:58:56,711
How could he do such
an atrocity to his wife?

1145
01:58:56,796 --> 01:59:01,883
So pitiful! How much Sita
was traumatized by his deed?!

1146
01:59:01,968 --> 01:59:05,011
Would she become a prey to any animal?

1147
01:59:09,183 --> 01:59:12,561
Don't say like that
Don't blame him

1148
01:59:12,770 --> 01:59:15,147
His path is virtuous path

1149
01:59:17,692 --> 01:59:20,485
His heart is very kind

1150
01:59:23,531 --> 01:59:26,741
Mother! Without knowing
the truth don't glorify him

1151
01:59:26,826 --> 01:59:28,869
We can't bear to hear you praise him

1152
01:59:30,705 --> 01:59:32,706
Hereafter we won't chant his name

1153
01:59:33,374 --> 01:59:34,457
We don't sing Ramayana story

1154
01:59:34,542 --> 01:59:37,419
By chanting his name
don't bring dishonesty to this hermitage

1155
01:59:37,545 --> 01:59:39,963
Children! Stop it

1156
01:59:40,464 --> 01:59:42,132
Stop blabbering

1157
01:59:43,134 --> 01:59:44,384
Punish yourself

1158
01:59:44,677 --> 01:59:50,515
Whom, all Gods and sages praise
as THE Supreme God...

1159
01:59:50,600 --> 01:59:55,437
...chanting His name
makes sins disappear

1160
01:59:55,521 --> 02:00:00,859
Don't blame that Supreme God
and reap more sins

1161
02:00:01,652 --> 02:00:06,448
You don't have any right
to blame him or chant his name

1162
02:00:07,116 --> 02:00:10,327
Whatever you have learnt
will turn to ashes

1163
02:00:10,411 --> 02:00:11,328
Go away

1164
02:00:11,787 --> 02:00:14,039
Don't show me your faces

1165
02:00:50,743 --> 02:00:54,329
Rama...Rama

1166
02:00:54,622 --> 02:00:59,668
Calling Rama...Rama

1167
02:00:59,752 --> 02:01:04,422
Calling Rama...Rama
Everyone in the assembly is seeking Him

1168
02:01:04,507 --> 02:01:08,385
Child Rama walks silently

1169
02:01:12,139 --> 02:01:16,059
Calling Rama...Rama
Everyone in the assembly is seeking Him

1170
02:01:16,143 --> 02:01:19,729
Child Rama walks silently

1171
02:01:19,814 --> 02:01:23,566
King's Assembly...
Handsome child Rama

1172
02:01:23,651 --> 02:01:27,779
Delivers sweet talk...
captivating all with his charm

1173
02:01:27,863 --> 02:01:31,700
Can't control his mischievous streak
He makes everyone happy

1174
02:01:31,784 --> 02:01:35,453
And Sage Vasishta likes
the naughty streak of child Rama

1175
02:01:35,538 --> 02:01:43,044
Calling Rama...Rama
everyone in the assembly adore him

1176
02:01:43,129 --> 02:01:47,173
Child Rama walks silently

1177
02:02:02,690 --> 02:02:06,776
With his arrow he draws
monkey images in the hall

1178
02:02:10,239 --> 02:02:14,743
Diamond ring he throws at the crow

1179
02:02:17,955 --> 02:02:21,791
He eats the fruit bitten by Sabari

1180
02:02:21,876 --> 02:02:26,046
And he feeds the dates to the squirrel

1181
02:02:26,130 --> 02:02:33,470
Behind the tree he hides
and makes the bridge with stones

1182
02:02:33,554 --> 02:02:37,182
Their parents like his mischievousness

1183
02:02:37,308 --> 02:02:41,144
And cuddle him with affectionate kisses

1184
02:02:41,228 --> 02:02:42,771
Rama...Rama

1185
02:02:42,855 --> 02:02:44,773
Calling Rama...Rama

1186
02:02:44,857 --> 02:02:48,818
Calling Rama...Rama
everyone in the king's hall seek him

1187
02:02:48,903 --> 02:02:52,864
Child Rama walks by quietly

1188
02:03:00,831 --> 02:03:05,043
He skips food and climbs up the stairs

1189
02:03:08,547 --> 02:03:12,926
And spills rosewater
in the gold vessel on the earth

1190
02:03:16,138 --> 02:03:19,891
An adamant child he is,
and asks for the Moon

1191
02:03:19,975 --> 02:03:24,354
He hides the moon in his pocket
that is reflected in the mirror

1192
02:03:35,449 --> 02:03:38,952
Such a naughty kid
was Rama in his childhood

1193
02:03:39,161 --> 02:03:42,872
He was very impish

1194
02:03:42,957 --> 02:03:47,001
You are our mother and father

1195
02:03:47,461 --> 02:03:56,052
We'll never cross our limits
Forgive our mistakes

1196
02:03:57,346 --> 02:03:58,930
Rama...Rama

1197
02:03:59,014 --> 02:04:00,974
Calling Rama...Rama

1198
02:04:01,058 --> 02:04:04,894
Calling Rama...Rama
everyone in the king's hall adore him

1199
02:04:05,020 --> 02:04:08,982
Child Rama walks silently

1200
02:04:23,914 --> 02:04:27,000
- Our greetings to Sage Valmiki
- May God bless you

1201
02:04:27,209 --> 02:04:28,126
Who are you?

1202
02:04:28,210 --> 02:04:32,046
We are ambassadors
of Ayodhya king Rama

1203
02:04:34,341 --> 02:04:37,051
King has decided
to perform the Ashwamedha sacrifice...

1204
02:04:37,136 --> 02:04:40,388
...for welfare of his people
and his kingdom

1205
02:04:41,223 --> 02:04:42,474
Sacrifice!?

1206
02:04:46,854 --> 02:04:49,230
Has the king Rama decided
to perform the sacrifice?

1207
02:04:49,315 --> 02:04:50,565
Yes, sage

1208
02:04:50,774 --> 02:04:54,861
Including Sage Vasishta,
all the elders of the kingdom have consented

1209
02:04:55,696 --> 02:04:58,990
Is it? Let his wish get fulfilled

1210
02:04:59,492 --> 02:05:02,827
Convey my best wishes to him
for the sacrifice

1211
02:05:02,912 --> 02:05:06,623
Not only your wishes,
he needs your blessings too

1212
02:05:06,707 --> 02:05:11,294
It means he invited you and
your disciples to the sacrificial venue

1213
02:05:11,378 --> 02:05:15,381
...and asked you to bless it

1214
02:05:15,966 --> 02:05:17,175
Certainly

1215
02:05:17,927 --> 02:05:20,887
Everyone will obey the words of Sri Rama

1216
02:05:21,180 --> 02:05:25,308
Tell him that we'll come there
after checking the auspicious time

1217
02:05:25,434 --> 02:05:26,976
We take leave, Sage

1218
02:06:15,234 --> 02:06:18,069
- Sage
- What mother?

1219
02:06:18,320 --> 02:06:24,826
Can any king perform the sacrifice
without his wife's company?

1220
02:06:24,910 --> 02:06:27,120
It is a sin, mother
It is prohibited

1221
02:06:27,454 --> 02:06:31,291
No sacrifice should be done
without the wife's presence

1222
02:06:34,044 --> 02:06:37,130
Oh Sun God, well versed in all vedas

1223
02:06:37,256 --> 02:06:40,925
- Greetings mother!
- What dear?

1224
02:06:41,010 --> 02:06:44,721
What do you want?
Do you want flowers?

1225
02:06:45,139 --> 02:06:47,890
The saviour of world...

1226
02:06:48,267 --> 02:06:51,853
- I have a divine doubt
- Ask me, dear!

1227
02:06:53,939 --> 02:06:59,235
Has anyone done a sacrifice
without his wife's presence?

1228
02:06:59,361 --> 02:07:06,951
No, it is impossible
No law will accept it

1229
02:07:07,328 --> 02:07:13,916
If the 1st wife is dead, he can remarry

1230
02:07:14,043 --> 02:07:19,839
...and perform the sacrifice
with his 2nd wife

1231
02:07:21,550 --> 02:07:23,509
There is no option

1232
02:10:30,405 --> 02:10:35,159
Sita...my beloved wife

1233
02:10:43,877 --> 02:10:49,715
As a king, I've saved my kingdom's honour
but l've abandoned you

1234
02:10:50,342 --> 02:10:52,885
No punishment is enough
for this sin

1235
02:10:53,679 --> 02:10:56,305
There is no repentance for this great sin

1236
02:11:00,853 --> 02:11:05,731
Though I've abandoned you,
you are still with me

1237
02:11:06,567 --> 02:11:08,734
You are living in my heart

1238
02:11:09,111 --> 02:11:12,238
I remember you always

1239
02:11:18,120 --> 02:11:22,415
Your glowing smile...
Your ethereal beauty...

1240
02:11:22,875 --> 02:11:24,125
And the scent from you...

1241
02:11:28,005 --> 02:11:32,967
This scent is only from of my Sita

1242
02:11:38,765 --> 02:11:43,060
Moon dot!

1243
02:11:44,229 --> 02:11:47,899
Someone has put the dot
on this golden idol

1244
02:11:48,150 --> 02:11:51,694
Who could it be other than Sita?

1245
02:11:51,778 --> 02:11:53,070
Others can't adorn it

1246
02:11:54,406 --> 02:11:57,074
Has Sita come here?
Is she here?

1247
02:11:57,910 --> 02:12:01,078
Is it my dream or reality?
Or illusion?

1248
02:12:04,791 --> 02:12:07,543
Sita, where are you?

1249
02:12:08,587 --> 02:12:10,171
Why do you play with me?

1250
02:12:11,965 --> 02:12:14,884
Sita...Sita

1251
02:12:41,244 --> 02:12:43,037
What a pleasant touch!

1252
02:12:44,414 --> 02:12:49,085
What a great aroma!

1253
02:12:52,172 --> 02:12:57,009
This is my Sita
It is her hand that's touching me

1254
02:13:03,225 --> 02:13:08,938
Sita, don't leave me
Don't go away

1255
02:13:14,653 --> 02:13:17,238
You came just now
and disappeared soon

1256
02:13:17,739 --> 02:13:21,075
Why do you play with me?
Why this hide and seek?

1257
02:13:23,328 --> 02:13:28,666
Sita, I am stone-heart
But you are very kind

1258
02:13:28,834 --> 02:13:30,209
Daughter of Goddess Mother earth

1259
02:13:30,377 --> 02:13:32,461
Forgiving others is your natural conduct

1260
02:13:33,171 --> 02:13:36,215
Bless me
Forgive me

1261
02:14:08,540 --> 02:14:12,918
Mother! Have you seen the real character
of one who speaks the truth

1262
02:14:13,003 --> 02:14:16,589
...and the saviour of dharma, Sri Rama?

1263
02:14:20,302 --> 02:14:23,596
One word...one arrow...one wife

1264
02:14:23,847 --> 02:14:29,727
- This is the Veda of Sri Rama
- I've understood, Sage

1265
02:14:30,228 --> 02:14:34,815
I've seen the glorious image
of my lord and I felt happy

1266
02:14:34,900 --> 02:14:40,279
I'll tell you a wonderful incident
of Rama's natural character

1267
02:14:40,906 --> 02:14:46,285
After killing demon Ravana,
Rama was resting on a stone

1268
02:14:46,411 --> 02:14:49,538
He noticed a shadow approaching him

1269
02:14:50,499 --> 02:14:53,334
He realised it was a shadow of a woman

1270
02:14:53,460 --> 02:14:57,880
To avoid touching that shadow,
he lifted up his legs

1271
02:14:57,964 --> 02:15:03,844
Oh king Rama! I am Mandodhari,
the wife of demon king Ravana

1272
02:15:04,387 --> 02:15:10,226
My husband, known for his penance,
is blessed by lord Siva and born to win

1273
02:15:10,352 --> 02:15:13,813
I have come to see the brave man
who could kill my husband

1274
02:15:13,897 --> 02:15:18,359
Not only I've seen you,
but also l've understood your character

1275
02:15:18,443 --> 02:15:22,279
I know now, the one who didn't touch
even the shadow of another's wife...

1276
02:15:22,364 --> 02:15:27,535
...only he can kill my husband
who desired another's wife

1277
02:15:27,619 --> 02:15:32,498
Oh chivalrous Rama! I salute you

1278
02:15:35,877 --> 02:15:43,092
I too foolishly, and in anger
suspected that he remarried someone

1279
02:15:44,261 --> 02:15:45,886
I distrusted him

1280
02:15:48,306 --> 02:15:53,102
I sinned
I thought ill of him

1281
02:15:53,478 --> 02:15:55,938
I have sinned knowingly and completely

1282
02:15:56,231 --> 02:15:58,691
There is no forgiveness for me, sage

1283
02:16:02,571 --> 02:16:07,533
Advice me
I can't bear this pain

1284
02:16:08,869 --> 02:16:16,709
Mother! Anger, error and suspicions
are common for human beings

1285
02:16:17,377 --> 02:16:19,795
Should learn from our mistakes...

1286
02:16:19,921 --> 02:16:24,091
...and confess to God

1287
02:16:24,176 --> 02:16:26,427
That is real repentance

1288
02:16:28,471 --> 02:16:29,597
That is not enough

1289
02:16:30,307 --> 02:16:35,311
I want to be purified by fire

1290
02:16:38,732 --> 02:16:40,441
Don't be hasty

1291
02:16:41,985 --> 02:16:46,447
Fine, because you are obsessing

1292
02:16:46,531 --> 02:16:49,909
...I'll give you a solution

1293
02:16:51,703 --> 02:16:57,166
Fast to Sri Lalithambika,
Goddess of the world!

1294
02:17:00,337 --> 02:17:02,213
Thank you, sage

1295
02:17:04,341 --> 02:17:06,675
Mother! I caution you

1296
02:17:07,761 --> 02:17:11,222
This fasting should be performed
with utmost devotion

1297
02:17:11,598 --> 02:17:17,811
You should worship the Goddess
with 100 sacred lotuses for 1 1 nights

1298
02:17:17,979 --> 02:17:23,525
It is an important rule and
be on your guard

1299
02:17:23,610 --> 02:17:28,155
From the day you start the fasting
and till you complete it...

1300
02:17:28,615 --> 02:17:31,659
...you shouldn't stop mid way

1301
02:17:32,327 --> 02:17:36,372
Whatever trouble may befall
you shouldn't stop fasting

1302
02:17:36,581 --> 02:17:37,998
Certainly

1303
02:17:38,291 --> 02:17:44,505
I'll fast with total devotion
with my husband's grace and your blessings

1304
02:17:44,589 --> 02:17:48,676
But you asked me to fast
with 100 sacred lotuses...

1305
02:17:48,760 --> 02:17:52,012
How can I get
those flowers in this forest?

1306
02:17:52,097 --> 02:17:55,766
I know where to find them, mother!
I can get it for you

1307
02:17:56,309 --> 02:17:57,351
How can you!?

1308
02:17:57,435 --> 02:18:02,064
Mother! I know all the mountains, rivers,
canals, and ponds around here

1309
02:18:03,316 --> 02:18:06,610
I know all flowers and trees, mother

1310
02:18:06,695 --> 02:18:11,782
I'll bring the fresh flowers
I'll fly and bring them

1311
02:18:11,866 --> 02:18:15,744
Yes mother! Our Balaraj is strong

1312
02:18:16,621 --> 02:18:20,457
However far it may be,
he can fly and bring them

1313
02:18:20,625 --> 02:18:24,837
- Mother! We'll also go with him
- Children, Kusa Lava!

1314
02:18:29,092 --> 02:18:31,176
You have other responsibilities

1315
02:18:32,053 --> 02:18:35,431
It is the time for me to meditate

1316
02:18:35,765 --> 02:18:44,189
Until I return, you guard your mother,
her pooja and the hermitage

1317
02:18:44,274 --> 02:18:45,816
We'll do as you say

1318
02:19:56,846 --> 02:19:59,973
The king of Ayodhya with
golden doll of Sita

1319
02:20:00,100 --> 02:20:06,688
Sri Rama who performs Ashwamedha sacrifice
is now starting with this horse

1320
02:20:06,773 --> 02:20:10,901
The horse that has a flag of
Ishvaku dynasty with symbol of a tree...

1321
02:20:10,985 --> 02:20:15,781
...will roam around the sky
and in all directions freely

1322
02:20:15,865 --> 02:20:21,161
Wherever the horse runs, the place
becomes gifted land to Ayodhya

1323
02:20:21,496 --> 02:20:29,586
The gifted land's protection and welfare
is Ayodhya king's responsibility

1324
02:20:29,838 --> 02:20:36,385
If anyone stops or ties this horse

1325
02:20:36,469 --> 02:20:39,721
Army of Ayodhya will wage a war
and capture their city

1326
02:20:40,473 --> 02:20:47,688
Sri Rama's brother, Prince Lakshmana
will command this journey

1327
02:20:47,772 --> 02:20:51,442
Hail Sri Rama
Hail Sita

1328
02:20:53,820 --> 02:20:57,114
Victory to Rama

1329
02:20:57,198 --> 02:21:00,951
Victory to Lakshmana

1330
02:22:08,353 --> 02:22:10,312
Mother! What about us?

1331
02:22:27,372 --> 02:22:30,541
Keep that basket aside
Those flowers also

1332
02:22:30,667 --> 02:22:34,878
Hey, look there!

1333
02:22:41,803 --> 02:22:44,930
Oh, it is a horse decorated
with jewels and a crown

1334
02:22:45,014 --> 02:22:46,557
It seems like a horse
of a royal nature

1335
02:22:46,641 --> 02:22:49,393
- It should be called a divine horse
- No, it's some ordinary horse

1336
02:22:49,477 --> 02:22:52,145
It is neither divine nor ordinary horse
It seems like a donkey

1337
02:22:56,859 --> 02:22:59,736
It is trampling on our fruits and flowers

1338
02:23:04,993 --> 02:23:06,493
Stop

1339
02:23:10,540 --> 02:23:11,665
Hey, stop

1340
02:23:29,601 --> 02:23:30,934
Brother! Try to tie it

1341
02:23:42,280 --> 02:23:44,865
It is an arrogant horse
Let's tie it to a tree

1342
02:23:44,949 --> 02:23:46,700
It has spoilt our fruits and flowers

1343
02:23:46,784 --> 02:23:50,037
Let the owner come
We'll reprimand him

1344
02:23:50,872 --> 02:23:54,916
Even if the owner is someone great
how did he allowed this?

1345
02:23:55,835 --> 02:23:57,836
Brother! Look at this

1346
02:23:57,920 --> 02:23:59,671
Something is written on its face

1347
02:23:59,756 --> 02:24:04,259
- It seems like king's orders
- Oh God! This is some king's horse

1348
02:24:05,011 --> 02:24:09,514
- It reads 'King of Ayodhya'
- That means it is Rama's horse

1349
02:24:09,599 --> 02:24:16,355
Wherever this horse steps,
the land will belong to Rama's kingdom

1350
02:24:16,439 --> 02:24:20,692
- Will we become slaves to him?
- No, we won't

1351
02:24:20,777 --> 02:24:24,613
We know archery
We are brave and courageous

1352
02:24:24,697 --> 02:24:25,614
Nothing to be afraid of

1353
02:24:25,782 --> 02:24:28,200
- What if they ask us to release it ...
- We'll refuse to release it

1354
02:24:28,660 --> 02:24:32,204
We'll refuse to untie the horse

1355
02:24:32,664 --> 02:24:36,583
It is a great mistake
to disobey Rama's words

1356
02:24:36,668 --> 02:24:38,752
Not just a mistake,
it is a sin also

1357
02:24:38,836 --> 02:24:41,880
We have learnt in Ramayana
that he is the protector of dharma

1358
02:24:41,964 --> 02:24:44,716
What we learnt is different from reality

1359
02:24:44,801 --> 02:24:50,972
When Ravana came as a beggar
even Sita thought he was a good man

1360
02:24:51,057 --> 02:24:54,976
- But he was not like that
- He abducted her

1361
02:24:55,061 --> 02:24:57,646
Like you, we also thought
that Rama was a great person

1362
02:24:57,730 --> 02:25:01,316
After we went to Ayodhya,
we realized that he was not noble

1363
02:25:01,401 --> 02:25:04,820
He has cruelly abandoned his wife

1364
02:25:04,904 --> 02:25:08,657
If we tie this horse,
he'll come here himself

1365
02:25:08,741 --> 02:25:11,576
You can see his real character then

1366
02:25:11,661 --> 02:25:14,996
- What if he gets angry...?
- We aren't scared of his anger

1367
02:25:15,081 --> 02:25:16,998
We are brave and courageous

1368
02:25:17,083 --> 02:25:25,006
There are no brave people
like us in this world

1369
02:25:25,133 --> 02:25:30,262
There are no brave people like us...

1370
02:25:30,430 --> 02:25:34,516
- What if mother knows about it...
- No, don't tell her

1371
02:25:34,600 --> 02:25:36,518
- She'll get angry
- Okay

1372
02:25:36,602 --> 02:25:39,396
- Promise me
- We swear

1373
02:25:42,984 --> 02:25:44,067
My lord!

1374
02:25:46,904 --> 02:25:49,072
This is the way
Horse is over there

1375
02:25:49,157 --> 02:25:50,991
Then, go and bring the horse

1376
02:25:51,576 --> 02:25:54,411
I couldn't bring it
Someone has tied it

1377
02:25:54,495 --> 02:25:58,081
You mean our sacred horse!?
Who are those idiots?

1378
02:25:58,166 --> 02:25:58,999
Who are those arrogant men?

1379
02:25:59,083 --> 02:26:01,918
They are not warriors
Some sage's children

1380
02:26:02,003 --> 02:26:03,503
Were you afraid of them?

1381
02:26:03,713 --> 02:26:05,922
- Chief commander!
- Yes, my lord!

1382
02:26:06,007 --> 02:26:10,260
Go and warn the children and
bring back the horse

1383
02:26:10,344 --> 02:26:11,428
Okay, my lord

1384
02:26:14,348 --> 02:26:15,807
Look, sacred horse is over there

1385
02:26:18,644 --> 02:26:20,395
Who dared to do this?

1386
02:26:24,233 --> 02:26:26,985
My lord!

1387
02:26:28,070 --> 02:26:32,324
My lord! Save us

1388
02:26:32,408 --> 02:26:33,992
You arrogant boys!

1389
02:26:53,179 --> 02:26:54,930
You coward!

1390
02:26:55,014 --> 02:26:57,015
If you have guts, come face to face

1391
02:27:05,149 --> 02:27:10,153
Oh! Was it you who tied up
our sacred horse?

1392
02:27:10,238 --> 02:27:12,572
Yes, we did

1393
02:27:12,657 --> 02:27:14,491
Do you know whose horse this is?

1394
02:27:14,784 --> 02:27:19,246
The victorious Rama's horse

1395
02:27:24,168 --> 02:27:30,006
- I am his brother Lakshmana
- Greetings to you

1396
02:27:30,091 --> 02:27:31,675
Do you know who he is?

1397
02:27:31,759 --> 02:27:38,807
He is the brave man who cut
a girl's ears and nose in the forest

1398
02:27:39,433 --> 02:27:41,184
Not only that...

1399
02:27:41,269 --> 02:27:44,020
Though his sister-in-law
was like a mother to him...

1400
02:27:44,105 --> 02:27:49,943
This brave man abandoned
that pregnant lady alone in the forest

1401
02:27:50,027 --> 02:27:52,153
Younger brother and the elder brother

1402
02:27:53,656 --> 02:27:55,574
They make a perfect pair

1403
02:27:55,658 --> 02:28:00,579
In the past Rama left his throne
and went to the forest

1404
02:28:00,663 --> 02:28:03,999
...to obey his father's words

1405
02:28:04,083 --> 02:28:08,169
Now he abandoned his wife
for the sake of kingdom

1406
02:28:08,254 --> 02:28:10,589
Good! Excellent!

1407
02:28:10,673 --> 02:28:12,090
Hey young boys!

1408
02:28:12,174 --> 02:28:15,260
Without knowing anything,
don't talk as you wish

1409
02:28:15,678 --> 02:28:18,013
If you are angry, mock at me

1410
02:28:18,097 --> 02:28:21,516
If you blame Rama, I won't keep quiet

1411
02:28:21,601 --> 02:28:25,937
He married Sita, agreed solemnly
but he betrayed her

1412
02:28:26,022 --> 02:28:26,938
We won't keep quiet for that

1413
02:28:27,023 --> 02:28:28,690
Stop talking rubbish

1414
02:28:48,169 --> 02:28:52,172
- Brother, he is sending fire flames
- Let's pour water upon it

1415
02:28:52,298 --> 02:28:56,718
Our arrows of water
will answer his arrow of fire

1416
02:31:00,342 --> 02:31:03,762
Brother, why should we fight with him?

1417
02:31:03,846 --> 02:31:05,680
Waste of time

1418
02:31:05,765 --> 02:31:11,686
- Let's make him faint
- Yes, Rama will come here himself

1419
02:31:54,146 --> 02:31:59,317
Rama, are you going to
punish those small boys?

1420
02:31:59,401 --> 02:32:05,990
Who else there other than me can punish
those boys who made Lakshmana faint?

1421
02:32:06,492 --> 02:32:11,329
May be it's impossible,
but you must believe it

1422
02:32:13,040 --> 02:32:15,917
Mother, bless me

1423
02:32:16,752 --> 02:32:19,921
Son, victory to you
Let goodness prevail

1424
02:32:19,964 --> 02:32:21,172
Go carefully

1425
02:32:39,191 --> 02:32:42,861
Brother, look at the chariot
He is coming

1426
02:33:24,486 --> 02:33:26,029
Sri Rama!

1427
02:33:26,155 --> 02:33:29,324
What a bright halo!

1428
02:33:35,039 --> 02:33:37,248
He resembles Lord Vishnu

1429
02:33:37,333 --> 02:33:39,334
1st let us greet him

1430
02:33:39,418 --> 02:33:42,170
Later let's ask his explanation
for all that he did

1431
02:33:42,254 --> 02:33:44,714
We don't care
whether it is Rama or God

1432
02:33:52,389 --> 02:33:54,557
That arrow conveys our greeting

1433
02:33:57,394 --> 02:33:59,103
May God bless you a long life

1434
02:33:59,480 --> 02:34:01,814
This arrow conveys our refusal

1435
02:34:04,818 --> 02:34:05,652
What is that?

1436
02:34:05,736 --> 02:34:09,280
You have come to our place
we paid our respect for that

1437
02:34:09,365 --> 02:34:14,285
But we won't leave the horse
That's why this refusal

1438
02:34:19,208 --> 02:34:27,382
Dear children! Weren't you the ones
who sung Rama's story in Ayodhya?

1439
02:34:29,051 --> 02:34:34,847
Affection surges within me when I see you

1440
02:34:34,932 --> 02:34:40,311
No! We don't need that
We don't want your affection

1441
02:34:40,396 --> 02:34:43,982
Save us from the burden of your affection

1442
02:34:44,066 --> 02:34:45,733
Save us

1443
02:34:46,110 --> 02:34:47,110
Why do you say that?

1444
02:34:47,194 --> 02:34:51,906
The emperor, you made Sita
go through a fire-test

1445
02:34:51,991 --> 02:34:53,741
...we are afraid of your affection

1446
02:34:53,826 --> 02:35:00,373
Though your wife was pregnant,
you sent her to the forest cruelly

1447
02:35:00,457 --> 02:35:03,126
...We don't want your kindness
- We don't want

1448
02:35:03,627 --> 02:35:10,591
Knowingly or unknowingly
if you blame me...

1449
02:35:11,385 --> 02:35:14,887
...I won't be angry with you

1450
02:35:16,473 --> 02:35:21,102
You seem to be very brave,
courageous and knowledgeable

1451
02:35:21,186 --> 02:35:23,104
You are not the sage's children

1452
02:35:23,188 --> 02:35:25,481
We haven't said we are

1453
02:35:26,650 --> 02:35:29,569
Dear children! Who are your parents?

1454
02:35:29,653 --> 02:35:32,572
Why do you need details
when you've come to wage a war?

1455
02:35:32,656 --> 02:35:35,116
Why should you need our birth details?

1456
02:35:35,951 --> 02:35:37,535
Be calm

1457
02:35:37,619 --> 02:35:38,870
Don't try to bond with us

1458
02:35:38,954 --> 02:35:42,915
You are often calling us sons
Are you our father?

1459
02:35:43,125 --> 02:35:46,961
When l rule the kingdom of Ayodhya,
my subjects becomes my children

1460
02:35:47,129 --> 02:35:49,213
- This is not Ayodhya
- This is a forest

1461
02:35:49,423 --> 02:35:52,508
You are neither our father nor our king

1462
02:35:56,347 --> 02:35:58,598
You are not ordinary children

1463
02:35:59,350 --> 02:36:02,518
Are you Brahma and Siva
who have come to test my patience?

1464
02:36:02,603 --> 02:36:06,522
No need for Brahma and Siva
to come for this horse

1465
02:36:06,607 --> 02:36:09,442
Ordinary children like us are enough

1466
02:36:09,526 --> 02:36:12,528
- Let go of the sacred horse
- We won't untie it

1467
02:36:12,613 --> 02:36:16,032
You can try
to get it back, if you can

1468
02:36:16,116 --> 02:36:16,949
Or if you have guts

1469
02:36:17,034 --> 02:36:19,786
- Don't ask or beg us
- Fight and win

1470
02:36:19,870 --> 02:36:22,121
- Take the bow
- Send the arrow

1471
02:36:22,623 --> 02:36:27,460
I don't fight against children and women

1472
02:36:27,544 --> 02:36:31,381
He fought against Thataki (she-demon)
Did he forget that?

1473
02:36:31,465 --> 02:36:34,050
- Sita Rama!
- Janaki Rama!

1474
02:36:34,134 --> 02:36:35,718
Jagadhabi Rama!

1475
02:36:36,470 --> 02:36:39,138
It seems some magic power

1476
02:36:40,808 --> 02:36:42,517
I have to win over it

1477
02:36:57,157 --> 02:37:03,663
You brave children! I've understood
that you've been taught to use weapons

1478
02:37:03,747 --> 02:37:05,415
...including magical powers

1479
02:37:05,499 --> 02:37:11,295
It is the 1st lesson in the war-fare
to know about the enemy's strength

1480
02:37:11,922 --> 02:37:15,425
The arrow which killed
demons Ravana, Kumbakarna,...etc

1481
02:37:15,509 --> 02:37:18,636
...which has no opponent in 14 worlds

1482
02:37:18,720 --> 02:37:20,972
...which has more power than Brahmaastram

1483
02:37:21,056 --> 02:37:22,723
...the victorious arrow

1484
02:37:22,808 --> 02:37:25,435
Don't you know that is the arrow of Rama?

1485
02:37:25,519 --> 02:37:30,523
Don't you know that victory and defeats
are not in the hands of human?

1486
02:37:30,607 --> 02:37:32,191
Don't you know that?

1487
02:37:32,234 --> 02:37:33,860
Oh mother Sita!

1488
02:37:48,125 --> 02:37:49,292
Mother!

1489
02:37:51,712 --> 02:37:55,548
Hanuman! What is this?
Where did you come from?

1490
02:37:55,632 --> 02:37:56,466
What has happened?

1491
02:37:56,550 --> 02:37:58,718
Mother, the inevitable disaster
is about to happen

1492
02:37:58,802 --> 02:38:00,553
War between father and sons

1493
02:38:00,637 --> 02:38:01,137
Come fast

1494
02:38:01,221 --> 02:38:04,265
Mother! You shouldn't move from the altar
...and shouldn't stop worshiping

1495
02:38:04,308 --> 02:38:08,519
War between Rama and Lava Kusa

1496
02:38:08,604 --> 02:38:10,605
You have to come fast and stop that

1497
02:38:10,689 --> 02:38:14,233
Mother, stop! Don't go

1498
02:38:14,359 --> 02:38:15,610
Fasting should be stopped

1499
02:38:15,736 --> 02:38:16,569
It will be a sin to the Goddess

1500
02:38:16,653 --> 02:38:19,071
It is humiliation...bad omen...misfortune

1501
02:38:19,323 --> 02:38:22,492
What can be more of a bad omen
and misfortune than this?

1502
02:38:22,576 --> 02:38:24,577
One side is husband and
other side are sons

1503
02:38:24,661 --> 02:38:27,580
This side, arrow of Rama and
that side Rama's beloved sons

1504
02:38:29,500 --> 02:38:33,085
Oh goddess Kanchayani!
Goddess of the world!

1505
02:38:33,170 --> 02:38:34,504
Please forgive my sins
and protect me

1506
02:38:34,588 --> 02:38:38,674
Mother! Don't delay
Danger is nearing us

1507
02:38:55,108 --> 02:38:58,110
Sri Rama! Saviour of world!

1508
02:38:58,403 --> 02:39:02,782
You should save your scions
from this peril

1509
02:39:02,866 --> 02:39:06,202
Protect me and my sons

1510
02:39:06,286 --> 02:39:10,289
Not only for me and us...

1511
02:39:10,332 --> 02:39:15,253
Need peace for 3 celestial worlds
and 14 worlds

1512
02:39:15,671 --> 02:39:18,839
Show your kindness
Bless us

1513
02:39:20,759 --> 02:39:25,596
Sri Rama! Saviour of world! Save us

1514
02:39:47,536 --> 02:39:50,413
Do you realize what a big blunder
you were about to commit now?

1515
02:39:54,001 --> 02:39:55,835
How can you shoot arrows
at your own father?

1516
02:39:55,919 --> 02:39:58,838
Mother, is he our father?

1517
02:40:00,757 --> 02:40:01,841
Sita...

1518
02:40:11,435 --> 02:40:12,935
My beloved wife!

1519
02:40:40,505 --> 02:40:47,511
Mother, are you
mother Janaki and mother Sita?

1520
02:40:47,596 --> 02:40:51,390
Are you our mother, Mahalakshmi?

1521
02:41:07,699 --> 02:41:11,202
Father! Forgive us

1522
02:41:19,920 --> 02:41:22,254
The pleasure of caressing my children...

1523
02:41:22,339 --> 02:41:26,509
...warm embraces of my children...

1524
02:41:27,552 --> 02:41:30,012
You offered this to me only now

1525
02:41:31,139 --> 02:41:32,723
I am very happy

1526
02:41:38,188 --> 02:41:45,194
Father, bear what we did
with stupidity and arrogance

1527
02:41:45,278 --> 02:41:49,198
Forgive us our sins
what we did unknowingly

1528
02:41:49,950 --> 02:41:52,535
They are not your sins and faults

1529
02:41:53,453 --> 02:41:55,162
You are greater than your father

1530
02:41:55,997 --> 02:41:59,583
I feel very happy

1531
02:42:12,305 --> 02:42:13,597
Mother! Greetings!

1532
02:42:13,807 --> 02:42:15,808
After a long time I got
a chance to meet you

1533
02:42:15,892 --> 02:42:21,063
Janaki devi, your prayers
got fulfilled now

1534
02:42:23,400 --> 02:42:26,986
Oh my well-wisher!
I came here full of sorrow

1535
02:42:27,070 --> 02:42:31,991
You performed my bangle ceremony
and took care my delivery...

1536
02:42:32,075 --> 02:42:36,620
And looked after me and my sons

1537
02:42:36,705 --> 02:42:39,331
Oh Hermit! Father!

1538
02:42:39,416 --> 02:42:41,500
I am very thankful to you

1539
02:42:43,628 --> 02:42:47,590
Because of your kindness,
my fasting and my duty in this world...

1540
02:42:47,716 --> 02:42:50,301
...have both come to end

1541
02:42:50,385 --> 02:42:53,888
Why are you saying so, Mother?
There are many duties you must do

1542
02:42:53,972 --> 02:42:56,724
As wife of Sri Rama...
As queen of Ayodhya...

1543
02:42:57,017 --> 02:42:59,643
- Under your rule...
- No dear!

1544
02:43:00,103 --> 02:43:02,104
I don't have any wish for myself

1545
02:43:02,439 --> 02:43:05,274
This life that I lived is enough for me

1546
02:43:06,109 --> 02:43:08,736
I am born to the Goddess of earth...

1547
02:43:08,862 --> 02:43:11,322
and have entered in to your Raghu dynasty

1548
02:43:11,573 --> 02:43:18,078
Because of me, without bringing
any dishonesty to my parents and in-laws

1549
02:43:18,330 --> 02:43:24,627
...my life is now enriched
after I handed your scions over to you

1550
02:43:25,003 --> 02:43:26,796
I take leave now

1551
02:43:35,597 --> 02:43:37,306
Oh Sri Rama!

1552
02:43:48,902 --> 02:43:51,111
No mother! No

1553
02:44:01,998 --> 02:44:04,458
Let Lava Kusa rule Rama's kingdom

1554
02:44:04,751 --> 02:44:07,378
Let Hanuma get Rama's devotion

1555
02:44:18,139 --> 02:44:23,018
Let the world be happy

1556
02:44:27,941 --> 02:44:30,734
Oh Goddess of earth!

1557
02:44:31,027 --> 02:44:35,698
I refused to come to you
when you called me that day

1558
02:44:36,199 --> 02:44:38,617
Now I am coming happily

1559
02:44:39,452 --> 02:44:43,956
I, by body, mind and heart...

1560
02:44:44,040 --> 02:44:50,170
If I am an innocent wife
only to my beloved Sri Rama...

1561
02:44:50,255 --> 02:44:56,260
Oh Goddess! Take me to your lap

1562
02:45:36,593 --> 02:45:37,801
Mother!

1563
02:46:55,255 --> 02:46:56,755
Mother Janaki!

1564
02:46:56,881 --> 02:47:00,175
Mother!

1565
02:47:19,529 --> 02:47:25,909
Rama, be calm

1566
02:47:26,202 --> 02:47:29,288
You are the Saviour of our world!

1567
02:47:29,372 --> 02:47:31,206
You shouldn't worry

1568
02:47:31,416 --> 02:47:32,374
Be calm

1569
02:49:07,971 --> 02:49:12,975
Let the world be filled
with prosperity and plenty!
