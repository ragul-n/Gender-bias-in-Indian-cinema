00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:18,929
- It's gone on
far too long now.

705
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:21,899
- That's why we're here.

706
00:38:22,899 --> 00:38:27,003
- Sorry I'm late guys.
Had a bit of shit to deal with.

707
00:38:28,003 --> 00:38:30,407
Right, we're all here.

708
00:38:30,407 --> 00:38:33,110
Let's get it sorted.
- Frank,

709
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:34,644
I don't know
about everybody else,

710
00:38:34,644 --> 00:38:38,115
but right now, I am not happy.

711
00:38:38,115 --> 00:38:39,783
I've had enough.

712
00:38:39,783 --> 00:38:42,819
The other night,
two of my boys outside

713
00:38:42,819 --> 00:38:44,121
Antonio's restaurant,

714
00:38:44,121 --> 00:38:47,924
they get shot
by your people.

715
00:38:47,924 --> 00:38:49,726
- Eh, and Crow.

716
00:38:49,726 --> 00:38:51,428
He's in danger.

717
00:38:51,428 --> 00:38:53,497
These are my familia.

718
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:57,134
- I've had a word with Crow.

719
00:38:57,134 --> 00:38:59,536
And Diesal.

720
00:38:59,536 --> 00:39:03,573
And I can assure you,
it won't be happening again.

721
00:39:03,573 --> 00:39:06,041
- Well, Frank, let me tell you
something.

722
00:39:06,041 --> 00:39:08,745
If I see Diesal on my manor,

723
00:39:08,745 --> 00:39:11,448
I will personally
cut his balls off.

724
00:39:11,448 --> 00:39:13,049
- You won't.

725
00:39:13,049 --> 00:39:14,418
- Okay.

726
00:39:14,418 --> 00:39:16,453
- Listen guys,

727
00:39:16,453 --> 00:39:17,021
I've got
this all under control.

728
00:39:18,021 --> 00:39:19,656
- Yeah,
but it doesn't feel like

729
00:39:19,656 --> 00:39:21,525
you got it under control
Frank.

730
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:23,794
- What about the police
Frank?

731
00:39:23,794 --> 00:39:25,029
My boys can't go through
the door at the moment

732
00:39:26,029 --> 00:39:28,999
without falling over coppers.

733
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:31,668
You're supposed to have
the police pinned down.

734
00:39:31,668 --> 00:39:33,437
- Yeah.
- What's going on?

735
00:39:33,437 --> 00:39:35,807
- Lenny, listen to me.

736
00:39:36,807 --> 00:39:39,509
We've got the police
right where we need them.

737
00:39:39,509 --> 00:39:41,778
- Well, it doesn't feel
like it, Frank.

738
00:39:41,778 --> 00:39:44,748
- You cost us money, Frank.
- Frank, what about the gear?

739
00:39:44,748 --> 00:39:47,050
Nobody wants it.
- Can't sell it Frank.

740
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:48,652
- It's substandard.

741
00:39:48,652 --> 00:39:50,921
- Frank, let me explain
something to you.

742
00:39:50,921 --> 00:39:53,557
The transportation, the first
lot that comes through

743
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:55,058
is proper gear.

744
00:39:55,058 --> 00:39:57,694
This second lot--it's been
stamped on, it's cut.

745
00:39:57,694 --> 00:40:01,933
- And the merchandise
is always late.

746
00:40:02,933 --> 00:40:05,669
- I've had a word
with the military.

747
00:40:05,669 --> 00:40:09,673
The gear...won't be late.

748
00:40:09,673 --> 00:40:12,711
The gear...will be A grade.

749
00:40:14,711 --> 00:40:17,681
And it won't be stamped on.

750
00:40:17,681 --> 00:40:19,850
And it won't be cut.

751
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:22,085
Trust me.

752
00:40:22,085 --> 00:40:24,491
(indistinct chatter)

753
00:40:27,491 --> 00:40:28,758
- Shokka.
- Sit down.

754
00:40:28,758 --> 00:40:31,561
- Oh lads, calm down.
Shokka.

755
00:40:31,561 --> 00:40:33,697
What the fuck are you doing?
- Do you know

756
00:40:33,697 --> 00:40:35,098
where to find out
who killed my little brother?

757
00:40:35,098 --> 00:40:37,234
- Shokka, get that gun

758
00:40:37,234 --> 00:40:38,702
out of my face.

759
00:40:38,702 --> 00:40:40,637
- I'm not gonna
ask you again.

760
00:40:40,637 --> 00:40:42,572
- You know me.

761
00:40:42,572 --> 00:40:43,007
Shokka, you know me.

762
00:40:44,007 --> 00:40:46,977
- When I left,
I knew you had it in for me.

763
00:40:46,977 --> 00:40:48,612
So you got my brother.

764
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:50,247
I knew you wanted me dead,
Frank.

765
00:40:50,247 --> 00:40:52,716
- If I wanted you dead,

766
00:40:52,716 --> 00:40:55,050
you'd be dead a long time ago.

767
00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:57,220
I wouldn't need to kill
your little brother.

768
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:58,855
- So what was it
with the message?

769
00:40:58,855 --> 00:41:01,191
- That was for you to
come back and join me.

770
00:41:01,191 --> 00:41:02,792
- Don't lie to me Frank.

771
00:41:02,792 --> 00:41:05,161
- I'm not lying, Shokka.

772
00:41:05,161 --> 00:41:08,098
You left me.
Remember?

773
00:41:08,098 --> 00:41:09,866
- You better tell me
before I kill you.

774
00:41:09,866 --> 00:41:12,702
- If you was gonna kill me,

775
00:41:12,702 --> 00:41:14,738
you'd have done it already.

776
00:41:14,738 --> 00:41:17,741
I told you, I don't know.

777
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:19,809
- I just wanna know who
killed my little brother.

778
00:41:19,809 --> 00:41:22,612
- You go look on the road.

779
00:41:22,612 --> 00:41:24,556
You'll find your answer.

780
00:41:32,556 --> 00:41:35,894
(background chatter)

781
00:41:37,894 --> 00:41:39,829
- Fam, yeah.

782
00:41:39,829 --> 00:41:41,698
- Does Shokka know
you're here?

783
00:41:41,698 --> 00:41:43,934
- Fuck Shokka man--don't
need to know about nothing.

784
00:41:43,934 --> 00:41:45,969
- What do you mean
fuck Shokka, bro?

785
00:41:45,969 --> 00:41:49,205
If he finds out, me and him are
going to fall out, you know.

786
00:41:49,205 --> 00:41:51,942
- Relax man, he's not going
to find out about anything.

787
00:41:51,942 --> 00:41:54,945
- What do you mean relax,
bro?

788
00:41:54,945 --> 00:41:58,682
(ominous chords)

789
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:00,617
- How's it going bossy?

790
00:42:00,617 --> 00:42:01,219
Everything good?

791
00:42:03,219 --> 00:42:07,958
(speaking foreign language)

792
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:10,193
- Nah he's all right.
You're all right, innit?

793
00:42:10,193 --> 00:42:11,027
- Yeah, I'm blessed.

794
00:42:12,027 --> 00:42:13,634
- He's blessed.

795
00:42:17,634 --> 00:42:20,203
- Watchin' I you.

796
00:42:20,203 --> 00:42:22,205
Remember that.

797
00:42:22,205 --> 00:42:24,809
Bumbaclot.

798
00:42:25,809 --> 00:42:27,911
- You think I need a bossy
little man like you

799
00:42:27,911 --> 00:42:30,814
on my team?
You're not like us.

800
00:42:30,814 --> 00:42:32,682
- Now come on Diesal, man.

801
00:42:32,682 --> 00:42:35,318
Can't we make some serious
money now man?

802
00:42:35,318 --> 00:42:37,354
None of the small gun change
with it.

803
00:42:37,354 --> 00:42:39,054
You gonna help me or not?

804
00:42:39,054 --> 00:42:44,260
(ominous chords continue)

805
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:46,797
- What are you doing now?

806
00:42:47,797 --> 00:42:49,799
- Just about to drop off
some grams still.

807
00:42:49,799 --> 00:42:51,368
- Why don't you go fuck off
and drop off

808
00:42:51,368 --> 00:42:53,136
your little grams then?
- Come on Diesal.

809
00:42:53,136 --> 00:42:54,005
I'll do your thing
first, obviously.

810
00:42:55,005 --> 00:42:58,944
- "Do my thing--do my thing.
do my thing first."

811
00:43:00,944 --> 00:43:02,979
You know what?
I'm going to help you

812
00:43:02,979 --> 00:43:04,881
because Shokka's you're
little brother, and I like you.

813
00:43:04,881 --> 00:43:06,182
- Yeah, come tell me
what you want me to do.

814
00:43:06,182 --> 00:43:07,919
I'll do it now.

815
00:43:09,919 --> 00:43:12,294
- Ninja,
let my man do the thing.

816
00:43:18,294 --> 00:43:20,664
- Take this.

817
00:43:20,664 --> 00:43:25,269
Remember...no fuck up.

818
00:43:26,269 --> 00:43:28,104
- Are you listening?

819
00:43:28,104 --> 00:43:29,205
- Yeah.

820
00:43:29,205 --> 00:43:31,808
- You know Oldbury, yeah?

821
00:43:31,808 --> 00:43:33,010
Gonna cross over the
little motorway bridge

822
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:37,079
and you see them in
the little white building.

823
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:38,682
No fuck-ups, though.

824
00:43:38,682 --> 00:43:41,386
- There won't be
no fuck-ups, man.

825
00:43:43,386 --> 00:43:45,221
- Ey.

826
00:43:45,221 --> 00:43:47,290
No fuck-ups.

827
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:48,458
- Yo, who's that?

828
00:43:48,458 --> 00:43:49,926
- Yes, Thuggy, Shokka.

829
00:43:49,926 --> 00:43:51,327
- What's going on, Shokka bro?

830
00:43:51,327 --> 00:43:52,796
Long time. man.

831
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:54,698
- A lot's been happening, bro.

832
00:43:54,698 --> 00:43:57,099
- Yo, I heard.
Sending my condolences.

833
00:43:57,099 --> 00:43:58,902
- Yeah, I know.

834
00:43:58,902 --> 00:44:00,003
You know I'm going to find
out who did this, innit?

835
00:44:01,003 --> 00:44:03,072
Any news?
- Yeah, mate,

836
00:44:03,072 --> 00:44:04,908
I know something.
- Well, listen then.

837
00:44:04,908 --> 00:44:07,711
Meet me by the riverside
in ten.

838
00:44:07,711 --> 00:44:10,346
- All right, cool, cool.
(murmurs)

839

(edgy instrumentals)

840
00:44:14,184 --> 00:44:17,056
- Are you still stressing
over Shokka?

841
00:44:21,056 --> 00:44:23,126
Come on, if you was
in his shoes...

842
00:44:23,126 --> 00:44:26,061
- What do you mean
if I was in his shoes?

843
00:44:26,061 --> 00:44:29,299
- Well what would you think?
- The fuck do you know?

844
00:44:29,299 --> 00:44:31,747
I don't know, innit?

845
00:44:43,747 --> 00:44:47,317
- (sighs)
Thuggy, I swear bruth,

846
00:44:47,317 --> 00:44:50,187
I need to find out
who killed my brother.

847
00:44:51,187 --> 00:44:53,957
- So what, the police
don't know nothing?

848
00:44:53,957 --> 00:44:56,359
- They're saying
it's drug related.

849
00:44:56,359 --> 00:44:58,795
They haven't done
nothin'.

850
00:44:58,795 --> 00:45:00,897
- Tuk weren't no drug dealer.

851
00:45:00,897 --> 00:45:02,398
- Even I know that.

852
00:45:02,398 --> 00:45:04,834
You know the road.

853
00:45:04,834 --> 00:45:07,074
Don't make any sense
to me.

854
00:45:12,074 --> 00:45:15,378
Just before my pops
passed away,

855
00:45:15,378 --> 00:45:17,280
I made him a promise.

856
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,249
- What was that?

857
00:45:19,249 --> 00:45:21,018
- I told him I'd take care
of my family

858
00:45:22,018 --> 00:45:25,155
and make sure
they're always safe.

859
00:45:25,155 --> 00:45:27,858
I've messed up, man.
I've failed.

860
00:45:28,858 --> 00:45:31,795
- You and Tukka
are like family to me.

861
00:45:31,795 --> 00:45:33,799
So what do you want to do
really?

862
00:45:35,799 --> 00:45:38,401
- Find them.
Get them.

863
00:45:38,401 --> 00:45:40,003
And kill them.

864
00:45:41,003 --> 00:45:43,907
- This is what
we're gonna do, yeah?

865
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:45,542
Every drug dealer in the city,

866
00:45:45,542 --> 00:45:47,811
no matter if they sell
a five pound drum

867
00:45:47,811 --> 00:45:49,279
or a metric ton.

868
00:45:49,279 --> 00:45:52,549
Everybody's gonna get
the fucking shake up.

869
00:45:52,549 --> 00:45:55,185
