1
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,600
ls this the one we saw
in the ad the other day?

2
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:24,000
There you are. You liked it
and here it is

3
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,000
lsn't that right?
Let me serve the breakfast

4
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,000
''l must leave now, love.
- Already?''

5
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,500
''Bye, sweetheart.
- How about the outing, Papa?''

6
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:47,400
''The outing...? Tomorrow, dear.
- No, Papa. Today!''

7
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,000
You promised her for today.
Have you forgotten?

8
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,300
''l'm helpless. l can't find the time.
- Today, Papa...''

9
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,100
''Tomorrow, l promise. No engagements.
- Leave immediately...''

10
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:00,000
or she'll kick up a fuss.
l'll take care of her. Go on

11
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,600
''All right now... you could've at least
said a proper good-bye to Papa, darling''

12
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,500
You mustn't cry. Can Mama
take you for an outing then?

13
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,200
Where do you want to go?

14
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,200
ls it fun?

15
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,000
Papa? Where?

16
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,700
''Mama, call out to him''

17
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,500
''l've always told you, Shekhar.
We must tell Sarita everything about us''

18
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,500
How would that help?
l know Sarita very well

19
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,900
She'll never accept you

20
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,900
Hush dear... quiet

21
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,900
''Now look Shekhar. Whatever Sarita
says to you, just keep quiet. Please''

22
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,100
''Even if she asks you to separate
from me, just agree to it''

23
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:28,400
''Because she has the first right to you.
- You have as much right to me, Renu''

24
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,500
''Neither can l separate from her,
nor you''

25
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:35,600
''lt's time Sarita faces the truth.
- You're wrong, Shekhar. You know...''

26
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,900
''Now look, she must give you
as much respect as you give her...''

27
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,900
You...

28
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,600
''you are terribly hurt, aren't you?''

29
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,900
Which is why
l didn't want to tell you

30
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,600
Your daddy did a lot of favours to me

31
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,000
l couldn't refuse to marry you

32
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:31,000
l did my best to forget Renu

33
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
But destiny brought us
together once again

34
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:44,900
''Forgive me, Sarita... forgive me''

35
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,000
''Sarita, there's another thing''

36
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:04,700
''My Shalu has no one else
in the world. Accept her, Sarita''

37
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,800
Who would be a better mother
than you?

38
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,400
For my sake...

39
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:20,700
''give me a promise...
give me your word, please''

40
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,000
There is laughter...

41
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,400
there are tears

42
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:41,000
''life is all about
joys and sorrows''

43
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,600
''There is autumn
and there is Spring...''

44
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,500
seasons come and go

45
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:23,700
''lf one sleeps, protected...''

46
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:28,600
another craves for compassion

47
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:33,700
lf one is distraught...

48
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:38,500
another is showered with love

49
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,300
lf there is pain...

50
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,500
there is a balm

51
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:48,400
''life is all about
joys and sorrows''

52
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:56,100
''There is laughter,
there are tears...''

53
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:01,100
''life is all about
joys and sorrows''

54
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:31,100
Memories of days gone by...

55
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:35,900
continue to torment us

56
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:41,200
''Like shadows,
they come to haunt us...''

57
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,100
''like shadows, they go away''

58
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:51,200
''loneliness casts a pall
of gloom...''

59
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:56,300
''for life is all about
joys and sorrows''

60
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,200
One is forced to live...

61
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:38,600
for there are social mores

62
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,800
''There are days when
you gain and lose...''

63
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:48,500
''days when there are
promises to keep''

64
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,600
Restlessness overwhelms...

65
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,200
''life is all about
joys and sorrows''

66
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,200
''Life is all about
joys and sorrows''

67
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:29,200
''Hi, sis. You look great.
- l'm trying to''

68
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,300
Why're you so nervous?
- l told you

69
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,300
Officers from the bank l applied for
a loan from are coming to see me today

70
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,600
So what's there to be nervous about?

71
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:43,300
One look at you and they'll
give you the whole bank...

72
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,000
''and say, ''You may repay the
money whenever you wish to''

73
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,500
''And don't repay it,
if you don't want to''

74
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,300
How often have l told you Shalu...?
- That l mustn't slide like this

75
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,300
''l can't help it, Mama.
l always forget''

76
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:10,200
''Just talk to them with confidence.
- Not confidence, Ma. Over-confidence''

77
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:13,300
Over-confidence is the trend nowadays

78
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:19,000
''Don't joke about everything, Shalu.
Not everything in life is a joke''

79
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:23,200
But...
- l wonder why she talks nonsense

80
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,000
''All right, l'll leave''

81
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,900
See what junior has done! l wonder
why you like dogs so much

82
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,600
Because you don't like them

83
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:49,900
''ln any case, is there anything about me
that you approve of? What do you like?''

84
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,100
''Whatever l say is wrong,
whatever l think is wrong...''

85
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:56,000
whatever l wear is wrong...

86
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,700
and l think it's wrong for me
to even stay here

87
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,300
''See? She does it deliberately!
- Let her be, Mama''

88
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,200
''Rangeela, looks like she's had
a problem with her mother again''

89
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:39,400
Shalu... did you have another
argument with your mother?

90
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,900
''What is the matter, Shalu?''

91
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,800
Want to see her happy?
- Oh yes

92
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,400
''ln that case, tell her rightaway
that you're in love with her!''

93
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:02,000
''Sure... no, what if it
spoils her mood even more?''

94
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:07,300
Keep getting scared and you'll keep
me company all your life! Tell her!

95
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:12,200
''No, l can't tell her.
- Either you tell her, or l will!''

96
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,700
Shalu...
- One moment. l'll tell her

97
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:33,300
''Shalu, there's something
l want to tell you''

98
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,300
''Shalu, l...
- What?''

99
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:43,100
''Actually, l...
- Go on, Sameer''

100
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,100
Well... l have a special show!
l want you to attend it

101
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:50,200
''You will, won't you?
- You're an ass!''

102
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,000
''Okay, l'll surely come''

103
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:01,400
Forgive me for calling you over
for a meeting at such short notice

104
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
But this is an emergency

105
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,900
''Khanna lndustries has paid the farmers
of apples such a low price, this year...''

106
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,900
that the farmers have started
an agitation against them

107
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:15,100
l tried to telephone Mr Khanna.
But despite the best of my efforts...

108
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:20,700
Efforts! Efforts is what you have
been doing for the last fifteen days

109
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,900
When will your efforts end?
When the apples have rotted?

110
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,400
When people are already starving?

111
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,200
Why ask her? She's of no use!

112
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,400
What are we to tell the farmers
in our village?

113
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,000
What do you mean?
- They're rich folks...

114
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,500
how would they understand
the sufferings of the poor?

115
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,400
There's no point in talking to them.
lt's of no use!

116
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,000
Please try to understand
the point l'm making

117
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,200
''What's the matter, Principal?
What's the fuss all about?''

118
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,200
''How do l explain, dear?''

119
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:57,200
Mittal and his men are taking
advantage of the situation...

120
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,800
to dislodge Sarita-ji
from the Mayor's chair

121
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:04,200
''l assure you, should you choose me
as the mayor...''

122
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:08,000
l'll see your troubles vanish.
- l'll make you the Mayor!

123
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,400
What are you doing? That much of chilli
will set their tongues on fire!

124
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,400
ls that all?

125
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,400
And now?
- lt'll come out of their ears!

126
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:29,800
''Sarita-ji, whatever happens,
l'll raise my voice for my people''

127
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:34,500
''l'll see that they have their right,
because l don't wear bangles like you''

128
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:41,300
''Fantastic, Uncle Mittal! After that
fiery line, you must surely take a break''

129
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:46,500
''Coming up... yogurt-fries,
made specially by me''

130
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,200
Try some.
- No

131
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,500
''Sit down, Uncle Mittal''

132
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,700
''Here you are.
Urvashi, serve it to everyone''

133
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,600
''Had l been the Mayor,
l'd immediately solve...''

134
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,300
''Tasty, isn't it?''

135
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,000
What happened?

136
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,400
''lt's excellent, dear!''

137
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:18,900
One won't do... here's another.
You too...

138
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,500
l've made it

139
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:27,300
''This is only the beginning,
Uncle Mayor. Have more...''

140
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,900
Chilli!

141
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,100
What happened?

142
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,000
Try some more. What happened?

143
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:55,500
''What is the matter, Uncle Mittal?
Have another''

144
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,700
Come...

145
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,500
look at what your daughter has done!
Look at her misbehaviour!

146
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:11,300
''What's all this?
- No need to pretend, lady''

147
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,000
''You're the one who did all this!
- Watch your tongue, Mittal!''

148
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,600
''Quiet!
- But he's a cheapskate, Mama!''

149
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,400
He wants to instigate people against
you and himself become the Mayor

150
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:24,600
''Fantastic, Sarita-ji! Nice way of
humiliating me through your daughter!''

151
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,600
Let's go! There's no meeting
take place here!

152
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:33,800
''Please hear me out...
- You'll have to pay for this, Sarita-ji''

153
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:38,000
''You surely will! Let's go, everyone!
- Go away. Get lost!''

154
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,500
''Whatever happens, you can
never be the Mayor!''

155
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,700
''Shalu, what insolence is this?
- This was the only way...''

156
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,700
''of straightening out Mittal, Mama.
- lt's your way, maybe''

157
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:52,800
''With what you've done, you've left
no stone unturned in humiliating me!''

158
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,700
But it was only for...

159
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,700
''You will do nothing for yourself,
and interfere in my affairs''

160
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:03,700
You will be able to achieve
nothing in life! Go away

161
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
''Get lost, l say''

162
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Are you very angry?

163
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,400
Even with me?

164
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,500
You mustn't cry

165
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,300
Sit down

166
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,500
lt's okay if Mama scolds me

167
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,400
But why does she say
such nasty things to me?

168
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:17,300
''Am l her enemy?
- No, Shalu. That's not how it is''

169
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:21,500
You're mistaken.
- Am l really? l'll show you

170
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:26,800
Look. How lovingly Mama holds you
and she doesn't even touch me

171
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:30,000
Look at this... it's the
same story even in this one

172
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:41,800
Look at this... this!

173
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:44,600
And this is what l have
endured since my childhood!

174
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:49,700
You're only imagining the worst.
lt's nothing else

175
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,800
''Sis, the one who has to
endure it, will know how it feels''

176
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:56,100
You have always got love from Mama.
But l...?

177
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,800
l feel as if l were picked from a fair

178
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:04,500
Mama loves you as much as she loves me.
l can't hear such things against Mama

179
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:08,100
Because that's just what
l'm going to tell you

180
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:16,500
Don't ask me for any money!
- l won't! Mama's side-kick

181
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:19,100
Don't vent your anger on me.
- Mama's side-kick!

182
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,400
''Rangeela, she hasn't turned up yet''

183
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:32,200
She's not coming!
Sit on your thumb!

184
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,900
One mustn't stay
where one is not respected

185
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,800
l'm leaving!

186
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,900
What a predicament! l don't even
have the money to leave home!

187
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,200
God! Have mercy on Shalu

188
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,200
God! Have mercy on Shalu

189
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,800
l don't want alms

190
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:05,900
''So where are you all set to go?
- Sameer has a show, he has invited me''

191
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,500
Have you asked Mama?

192
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,400
''My darling sister,
that's your department.''

193
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,800
Take care of Mama.
- l'll think it over

194
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,900
l'm getting late. Here l go!

195
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:27,900
''Even if you say nothing, my love...''

196
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,900
your eyes do convey...

197
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:36,500
your love for me

198
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:44,900
''Your eyes do convey
your love for me''

199
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:55,300
''Even if you say nothing, my love...''

200
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,400
your eyes do convey...

201
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:04,900
your love for me

202
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:13,300
''Your eyes do convey
your love for me''

203
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:42,900
''Why are there beads
of perspiration on your forehead?''

204
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:52,800
''Do not lower your gaze
when you see me''

205
00:26:54,400 --> 00:27:01,600
''l know, you do pine for me
deep down in your heart''

206
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:10,400
''Your eyes give away
your love for me''

207
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Face to face with you...

208
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,700
l felt shy

209
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
l was tongue-tied...

210
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:48,000
such was the effect on me

211
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:56,800
''Every moment, l wait for you''

212
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:06,000
''Your eyes give away
your love for me''

213
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,900
These folks from Japan
think you're a great artist

214
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,900
They want to take you along to Japan.
- What?

215
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,700
''No, l'm not going''

216
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,800
''Sameer, at least think about me''

217
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:05,600
''When you go to Japan and make a name
for yourself, won't it make me happy?''

218
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:11,000
Don't you want me to tell the whole
world that you are my Sameer?

219
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:15,100
So that's how it is!
Here we go then... to Japan!

220
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:38,000
This is great. You do look nice in
those clothes you pinched from me

221
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:42,100
''Got any money on you?
- Yes, l do''

222
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:45,400
But may l ask...
where is the royal entourage headed?

223
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:48,100
On work.
- What?

224
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:53,100
Why not? Can only Mama and you work?

225
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,700
l want to prove it to Mama
that l can achieve something too

226
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:09,100
But where are you going?
- Khanna lndustries

227
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,500
But they're in the red
and they're sacking people

228
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,700
''Obviously, because
l haven't been there yet''

229
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:23,000
See what happens when l get there.
Khanna lndustries is going to thrive

230
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,200
''How will you find a job there?
- No place on earth, sis...''

231
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:29,900
where Shalu won't find a job!
- Shalu...

232
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,400
''Yes, Mama?''

233
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:59,700
''Khanna lndustries...
Shame! Shame''

234
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:03,800
Fulfill our demands

235
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,900
Mr Roopchand Khoobchand...?

236
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,600
Someone's here to see you.
- Who?

237
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:18,100
''Junior, it's some Shalu.
She says she has an appointment''

238
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:21,500
Only the Food lnspector
was supposed to come today

239
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:24,100
The new Food lnspector?
We've had it!

240
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,100
We have trouble out there and
here's the Food lnspector...

241
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:29,900
Call her in!
- Send Shalu in

242
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:34,800
''Junior, show me the stock-statement.
- At least comb your hair!''

243
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,500
What comb?
- Your wig!

244
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,400
Great hair!

245
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:50,100
Straighten it.
- Why're you doing that?

246
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,400
lt looked nice the way it was.
- lt was turned around

247
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,200
That was a different style...
absolutely novel

248
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:07,100
How about my hair?
- Yours is nice too...

249
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:12,200
but they won't turn around like his.
- They sure do... look!

250
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,600
You like our hair so much?
- Oh yes

251
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,900
They're real!
- When did l say they're fake?

252
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:26,100
Please sit down...
what can we do for you?

253
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:29,000
Don't ask. Just send for
something hot or cold

254
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,200
''Hold it... Sweetie, send some
tea and fries''

255
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:37,700
''Madam, it was nice talking to you.
- Me too''

256
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:44,200
You and we are going to work together!
- Absolutely. That's what l want too

257
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:49,700
Just tell me what my job will be.
- The Food lnspector before you...

258
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,700
''Mr Badhudhi, he came inspecting us
only once every month''

259
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:58,600
''With his eyes, ears and mouth shut!
- Just don't worry''

260
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,800
l'll write a better report
than he did

261
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,600
''With my eyes, ears and mouth...
everything shut''

262
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,900
That's nice of you!
- Child's play for me

263
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Just tell me how much money
you will pay me

264
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:18,000
''You do talk about everything openly!
Must say, women are fast nowadays''

265
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,800
''We have a budget of 10,000 Rupees.
- 10,000...?''

266
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,200
Every month. We'll pay in advance.
And in cash

267
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:29,300
''Here's 10,000 Rupees. Count it''

268
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:35,100
''There's no need to count it,
but l will''

269
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,300
Sure. Go ahead!

270
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:46,300
''What? The Food lnspector can't come?
But she's already here, you moron!''

271
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:50,600
''A man...? One moment!
You aren't a man, are you?''

272
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:57,300
There's a misunderstanding.
l'll find out and call back

273
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,600
Who are you?
- Shalu

274
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,200
l'm Roopchand!

275
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
''My brother, Khoobchand.
- Aren't you the Food lnspector?''

276
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:11,000
When did l say that?
- Set it right!

277
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:15,200
ls mine okay?
- One moment. Mine?

278
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:21,100
Cheat! Fraud!
What are you here for?

279
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:24,100
For the job.
- Job?

280
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:27,600
How dare you come in here?
- For a job!

281
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,100
l want to pull your company
out of the red and...

282
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:34,800
You get out first!
- You're making a mistake

283
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:38,300
You're going to regret it...
listen to that

284
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:45,000
''Roopchand... Khoobchand...
Shame! Shame!''

285
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:49,100
Fulfill our demands

286
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,700
Calm down. Calm down!

287
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,300
Beat them up!

288
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,700
Stop it! Calm down

289
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,700
We're with you!
We want your welfare...

290
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:11,200
Stop rioting and go home.
We'll do what we can

291
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,800
''All right, we'll go away.
But we won't spare you...''

292
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,000
if you don't settle our demands
by tomorrow! Let's go!

293
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,600
Wasn't he acting tough?
- He'll quit doing that...

294
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:24,600
who does he think he is?
- So what happens tomorrow?

295
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,900
''What else? They have
just two ways, Junior''

296
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:34,000
Either let the apples rot or sell
at half the price and make money

297
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,400
''Mittal sure had a brainwave, brother.
- True''

298
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:47,200
''lt's only a matter of time, Junior.
The day Khanna lndustries is sold...''

299
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:54,800
''Mittal will buy it and make us his
equal partners, as he promised to''

300
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,600
What a great day that will be!

301
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,400
What's she doing here?

302
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:06,100
She was listening to our conversation.
- What if she tells someone?

303
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,100
Let me ask. Wait

304
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,400
''Hey Shalu... what are you doing here?
- Well, l...''

305
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,400
''You haven't heard something, have you?''

306
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,200
l've heard

307
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:22,800
We aren't going to be afraid...
what did you hear?

308
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,200
Everything.
- Everything?

309
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:32,100
Yes. Everything.
- Now look... don't tell anyone

310
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,800
Not even Khanna Uncle?

311
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:38,400
You know Khanna?
- Sure

312
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,200
l've played with him
since l was a child

313
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:44,000
Played with him?
- Yes

314
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:48,200
He telephones me every day and
treats me like his own daughter

315
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,700
So why didn't you tell us?

316
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,000
''Send for the tea.
Sit down, dear. Sit down''

317
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:56,100
l don't want a job l get
out of a recommendation

318
00:36:56,500 --> 00:37:00,500
What recommendation? You've been
like a child to our master

319
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:06,100
''Mr Khanna is our boss. Brother,
that job of assistant manager...''

320
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:08,700
''Give it to her.
- A salary of 5,000 rupees''

321
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,800
5000...? No.
- 7000. ls that enough?

322
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:19,500
''7000 is all right, but there are
no guarantees on leaking information''

323
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:25,500
''All right then. 10,000 is final.
- Do we have the guarantee now?''

324
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:30,300
''You won't complain against us
to Mr Khanna, will you?''

325
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:33,700
What complaint? Which Mr Khanna?

326
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:54,400
''Terrible day, dad. l've never seen
so much of mismanagement in my life''

327
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:02,500
Which factory of mine is like that?
- Which one...? All of them are!

328
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:08,300
You've surely been to
someone else's factory

329
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:12,900
''As far as l know,
not only my managers...''

330
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,300
even my clerks are educated guys

331
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:23,200
None of your managers has any idea
of Chang's Theory of Productivity

332
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:26,400
Neither do they know about Dang's
Theory of Non-productivity

333
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Nor do they know about Fang's Theory
of Productivity of Non-productivity

334
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,100
Now... what's all that about?

335
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,500
You know nothing
about the theories either

336
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:53,000
''With these CEO's, l have decided
to shut down our plant in Palampur''

337
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:54,800
What for?

338
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:57,900
''For the last 5 years, it has been
incurring heavy losses, dad''

339
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:04,400
''My son, one must not worry
only about his own profits''

340
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:08,200
One must do things even for
the welfare of the others

341
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:14,100
''Why do you get so emotional, dad?''

342
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,300
''My son, it's because of our factory
that people in that city make a living''

343
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,600
''Okay, here's what we'll do''

344
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:31,600
l'll go there personally and find out
why the factory is incurring losses

345
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,700
''lt's okay if we can find a cure.
Else,...''

346
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:45,500
When do you want to leave?
- l'll go today itself

347
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:49,400
''Dev, will you go there
just like that?''

348
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,600
''lf you go there as Dev, the truth
behind the problems will never emerge''

349
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:05,300
''Dad, l'll go there not as your son Dev,
but as Anand, your chauffeur's son''

350
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:08,400
Just give me an appointment letter
for the job of a clerk

351
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:11,200
''What's one letter?
l'll give you ten, my son''

352
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:14,700
Just get there quickly
and take up the job tomorrow

353
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:40,700
Where's Khanna lndustries?

354
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,700
Where's Khanna lndustries?

355
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,500
Where have l landed?

356
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:06,700
Where's Khanna lndustries?

357
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,700
What are you saying?

358
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,400
Can't you speak Hindi?

359
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:34,700
''Hindi, Gujarati, French, ltalian...
you surely know some language?''

360
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:42,300
Keep them away... away!

361
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:50,500
''What's up, mister? You're fuming.
- Where is Khanna lndustries?''

362
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:54,800
So you want to go to Khanna lndustries?
- l wish to go Delhi!

363
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,600
l said Khanna lndustries only to
start a conversation with you

364
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:00,800
''This is where you'll get a bus
for Delhi, at 8 tonight''

365
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:20,100
Do you know where
Khanna lndustries is?

366
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,500
They shouldn't have done that.
- Who?

367
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,500
The bus-conductor.
- Why?

368
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:33,400
They have a battle going with
the government nowadays...

369
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:38,500
''for a salary hike. But to vent their
anger on the passengers, is not done''

370
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,100
They must fight the government.
lsn't it?

371
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:43,800
''All right, but what is the matter?
- What else?''

372
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:48,200
There was this passenger here yesterday
who said he wanted to see the Qutb Minar

373
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:51,800
But the Qutb Minar is in Delhi.
- l know that too

374
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:55,800
But that's what they told him
when he got off. That this is Delhi

375
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:03,500
And Delhi's 300 kilometers away.
- 300 kilometers? l've had it!

376
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:06,300
You won't have to travel that far

377
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,800
''You wish to go to
Khanna lndustries, right?''

378
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:12,300
lt's four kilometers away.
- Four...?

379
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:15,800
Yes. See that hill?
- That one?

380
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,500
''Yes, that tall one.
- Behind that?''

381
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:24,800
Oh no. Climb down that hill and
you will come across a small lake...

382
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:27,200
and then...

383
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,700
What was that?
- The song the boatman sings

384
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:38,300
Song?
- Yes. And listen...

385
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:41,500
don't ask anyone for
the address around here

386
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:44,900
They're experts at making
fools out of people

387
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,900
''No, l won't ask them.
l'm not a fool, am l?''

388
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:00,400
''You shouldn't have done that
to the poor guy, Shalu''

389
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,700
No poor guy. That's just what
the arrogant man deserved

390
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,700
We're having our laughs here
and he must be climbing the hill

391
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:10,700
''Yes, what he doesn't know...''

392
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,500
is that although there is
a way to climb the hill...

393
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:18,900
there is no way for him
to climb down

394
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:36,700
''Take my beloved across
the river, O boatman''

395
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:44,300
''Take my beloved across
the river, O boatman''

396
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:01,100
''Here you are, mister.
Khanna lndustries''

397
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,300
''Here you are... 50 rupees.
- All right, go on''

398
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,400
This is the point from where l set
out the day before yesterday!

399
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:19,900
Khanna lndustries is right there

400
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:26,300
So that girl was...?

401
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
lf l find her again...
l'll pluck her hair out!

402
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:34,000
l'll strangle her!
l'm not sparing her!

403
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:41,900
Give us an answer.
- What sort of a question is that?

404
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:45,800
''lf you wish to interview me, ask me
something to do with my work''

405
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,200
We're the ones interviewing you.
So we'll ask whatever we wish to!

406
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:54,600
So what do you think of our hair?
- Your hair?

407
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,500
''Third-rate! Obviously,
you guys are wearing wigs''

408
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,600
''ln those clothes,
you guys look like clowns in a circus''

409
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:05,900
And you guys talk like
illiterate village bumpkins

410
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:08,900
What illiterate? l'm a graduate!
Watch your manners!

411
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:12,000
What if l failed my grades in school?
- Never mind. He fails the interview!

412
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:14,900
''You're not getting the job. Get out!
- All right, now tell me something''

413
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,300
lf the company's balance-sheets
aren't all right...

414
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:20,400
which account does one look up?
- He's looking for a fight

415
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:23,500
Who mooted the Theory of
Productivity of Non-productivity?

416
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:26,900
''You, brother?
- Not me''

417
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:28,800
Not us

418
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:32,700
Are you interviewing us
or are we interviewing you?

419
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:36,100
When the two of you have no inkling
of these two basic theories...

420
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:38,300
you have no right
to conduct interviews

421
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:41,400
''Who hired you, in any case?
l'll talk to dad today...''

422
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:44,700
''l mean, Mr Khanna, right today,
and have you sacked''

423
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,300
Don't give us those threats

424
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,700
Not threats. He's upset because
he has failed in the interview

425
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:56,600
He has brought a letter from Mr Khanna.
We'll have to consider that

426
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,600
We've got to respect Mr Khanna
after all

427
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Must we employ him?
- We must

428
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:08,300
You are hired. Go on

429
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:11,000
''You're large-hearted, brother.
- Never mind''

430
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:14,000
Touch his feet. Hurry up!
- Never mind. Sit down

431
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,800
''Sir, we've got to deliver the goods
and there is no driver at all''

432
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:21,000
lt'll be managed. This is Anand. He'll
keep records and also be the driver

433
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:23,700
A clerk who will also
double as a driver?

434
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:28,000
''l'll explain everything to him.
What name, did you say?''

435
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,700
Dev Anand?
- Just Anand

436
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,200
l'll explain everything to him

437
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,400
You?
- l'll tell him that l'm his boss

438
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:45,800
''Now look, Mister...
- Damn it! You rotten...''

439
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,300
''No getting personal with me.
Call me ''madam''. l'm your boss''

440
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:52,600
To hell with the bosses!
4 kilometers to Khanna lndustries?

441
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:55,600
The hill and the lake
and the boatman...?

442
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,100
What are you talking about?
l hope you're all right?

443
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,400
You're the one who's going to be ill!

444
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:06,000
You're surely mistaken!
lt must've been another girl

445
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,200
l've never seen you before.
- You won't again! l'm killing you!

446
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:14,000
l'll report you to the bosses.
- Those baldies can't do anything to me

447
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:18,600
Open the door!
l'm going to knock your teeth out!

448
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,800
''First break the door,
you dumb idiot!''

449
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:23,000
Really...? Here goes!

450
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:29,300
What are you doing?
- And what are you doing here?

451
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:32,100
Never mind me...
what's gotten into you?

452
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:35,200
You're going to ruin my plans.
- One moment

453
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:39,900
Where were you for two days?
Your dad was so worried

454
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:42,900
So l came looking for you.
- How do l tell you...

455
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:47,200
that girl made such a fool out of me!
l spent a night and a day in the jungle!

456
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:54,100
A night with that girl? How romantic!
- With that girl...? Never!

457
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:58,500
He's a mere driver but he behaves
as if he's the employer

458
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:02,000
You'll know when he beats you up

459
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:04,500
Beat me up? Big deal

460
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:07,300
l must hang up now.
- What for?

461
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:10,100
There are tourists arriving in buses.
l've got to attend to them

462
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:13,400
Want me to come and help you?
l'm absolutely free

463
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:16,700
Will they let you go?
- Why not?

464
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:19,000
Has anyone ever been able
to stop me?

465
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,800
Come over then.
l'm hanging up

466
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,600
Wow! Your hair is glistening!
- Really?

467
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:35,400
Which shampoo do you use?
- We can't use any shampoo at all

468
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:39,900
''He means, our hair does not
need any shampoo at all''

469
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:42,500
''Right!
- That's amazing, sir''

470
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:46,600
l wish l had hair like that too.
- Sure you will... no?

471
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:52,100
''l want leave, sir.
- Leave?''

472
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:55,100
''Sure... Go ahead.
- All right, go on''

473
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:57,700
l need a driver too

474
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:02,600
Take that new driver...
he'll even be put to a test

475
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:07,000
You mean Dev Anand...?
He's so snooty

476
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:12,600
We're no less. Just tell us
if he bothers you

477
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,600
''We'll fix him. You've been treated
like a child by our master, after all''

478
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:19,000
Ever since l was a child

479
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:24,200
''This girl's a bit too fast.
- Sure, she is''

480
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:27,200
l've got all the information
on the factory's condition

481
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:30,700
The quality of production is terrible.
People are returning our goods

482
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:39,200
l don't know how we're going
to run this factory

483
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:41,500
Remember Chang's fundamental rule?

484
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:46,600
''When business gets out of control,
just shut it down''

485
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:51,200
''Narayan, let's prepare a report
after a complete investigation''

486
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:53,500
We're shutting down this factory

487
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:57,400
Here she is...
- Who?

488
00:50:57,500 --> 00:51:01,800
The manipulative one.
- She's quite a babe!

489
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:11,200
Get the car out.
Madam's got to go out

490
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:16,000
What's all this?

491
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:19,800
l'm your boss. Should l complain
to those baldies...

492
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,200
you'll lose your job in a second

493
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:27,700
Please go ahead. l'll follow you

494
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:33,000
l think she's hand-in-glove
with those baldies!

495
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,600
She uses a wig too?

496
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:41,200
lf l could get the opportunity
to straighten her out!

497
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:45,200
What are you doing?

498
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:48,500
Have you gone mad?

499
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:54,300
''You took me for a ride, didn't you?
Let me take you around Palampur now!''

500
00:51:57,300 --> 00:51:58,500
Drive slowly!

501
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:04,300
Have you gone mad?
ls that how you drive?

502
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:10,300
Don't you like the way l drive?
- l'll have you sacked!

503
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:14,900
''Now look, Madam, don't keep
giving me those empty threats''

504
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:18,300
l'm the son of Mr Khanna's chauffeur.
- So what?

505
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:21,700
l know Khanna Uncle very well too.
lf l report you to him...

506
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:28,100
he'll sack you and your father!
- Since when is Mr Khanna your uncle?

507
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:31,100
Since l was a child.
l've played with him

508
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:35,300
He loves me so much.
- What a liar

509
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:40,300
What did you say?
- Nothing. Shall we go?

510
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:44,400
Joker! Drive slowly!

511
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:54,300
May l have it packed then?
- Yes

512
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:58,800
''Driver, are you a tourist
on a holiday?''

513
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:01,400
Go and have this packed.
Over there

514
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:11,900
Pack that chair too.
- Chair?

515
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:30,300
Are you all right?

516
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:32,700
''You're not hurt, are you?''

517
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:34,700
Answer me!

518
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:43,300
l thought l'd open my eyes only
in hospital. But you saved me

519
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:46,100
''Oh no, it was actually my mistake''

520
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:50,000
''l was packing the chair, l didn't see
you taking things down from there...''

521
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:55,300
So here you are ... chatting away!
Didn't l ask you to pack the stuff?

522
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:59,400
The customers are waiting.
- He saved me from falling down

523
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:02,400
Shalu's sister

524
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:07,300
l mean Anand

525
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:12,300
''He's the driver l told you about.
- Look, Madam. l'm no driver''

526
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:16,700
l'm a graduate and a clerk.
- But you talk as if you are the boss

527
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:20,100
So he's the bossy one?

528
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:24,000
Has he thrashed you yet?
- Do you think he can thrash me?

529
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:29,000
Why're you listening to our chat?
Get on with your work

530
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:42,600
l'm listening. Go on.
- How's your investigation going?

531
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:46,000
''What will l tell you, Dev?
Everything is in a bad shape''

532
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:49,300
l'll have to go into the details.
- Quickly do whatever you've got to

533
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:51,700
That girl has made life
miserable for me

534
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:53,300
Hang on. l'll do it

535
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:56,300
What are you showing me?
- Look at this

536
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:58,300
This is bad

537
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:07,200
Why's the C.A. here?
- Dev has sent him here

538
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:11,200
He has checked all the books
and says things are so bad...

539
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:15,100
''we'll have to shut down the factory.
- That's just what we want, Roopchand''

540
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:16,600
What for?

541
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:22,000
''lf the factory does not close down,
how are we going to buy it?''

542
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:27,000
''You're right, but if the factory
closes down...''

543
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:30,600
the farmers will kick up a racket.
Their yield of apples will rot

544
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:34,900
Let their yield rot... it's time
to harvest our crop now

545
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:42,600
''l'll show you at the Town Hall today,
what happens when you kick a hungry man''

546
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:46,400
Long live the Farmers' Union

547
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:49,800
Meet our demands

548
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,700
At least hear me out

549
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:05,700
''l assure you, we'll surely find
a solution to this problem''

550
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:10,200
''We know none of the problem
is going to be solved, Sarita-ji''

551
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:15,000
''Remember, when we had a crisis
last year, l spoke to Mr Khanna...''

552
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:17,300
and got him to pay us 700 Rupees
for every quintal of apples

553
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:19,800
''And l...
- Well, well!''

554
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:23,100
We are not here to discuss
what happened last year

555
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:26,100
We want to know what's
happening this year

556
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:32,200
l have a request to make to
the members of the Committee

557
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:37,900
Give me just 24 hours to convince
Mr Khanna to think in your favour

558
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:42,100
''You're right, Sarita-ji.
l agree with her''

559
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:46,500
''We must give Sarita-ji the 24 hours.
- Sure, we must''

560
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:52,800
''Say it! We must.
- Yes, we must''

561
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:04,800
All right!
We give her another 24 hours

562
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:09,000
''They have a lot of hopes
pinned on you, you see''

563
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:12,300
But we will meet here again
tomorrow to see...

564
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:17,600
how you shatter their hopes

565
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:30,300
''Principal, l've decided to personally
go to Delhi and talk to Mr Khanna''

566
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:33,900
Delhi? Now? At this hour?
- Yes

567
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:38,000
We have very little time.
lf Mittal becomes the Mayor...

568
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:42,200
we know what's going to
happen to the farmers

569
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:45,600
l'll do my best to save
this city from disaster

570
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Okay?

571
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:57,200
''Sarita-ji, what happened?''

572
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:15,400
''What happened to Mama, doctor?
- Nothing to worry about''

573
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:20,200
Your mother suffers from hyper-tension.
l've given her a tranquiliser...

574
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:22,600
she only needs to rest

575
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:27,300
Dev is the root cause of all
the problems! He's a devil!

576
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:31,000
He wants to shut down the factory!
Who does he think he is?

577
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:34,700
l'm not going to spare him!
- Nor am l

578
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:40,400
''We must do something for Mama, sis.
- That's just what l can't figure out''

579
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:42,700
''Think of something, Shalu!''

580
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:47,700
Sis! l have a mind-blowing idea!
- l know what you're thinking about

581
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:52,700
lf Mama can't go to Delhi...
- The two of us can

582
00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:01,000
But one of us ought
to stay with Mama

583
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,700
''l'll be the one to go, darling.
l'll give Mr Khanna such sound logic...''

584
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,500
that he'll have to agree.
- Sis dear...

585
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:10,000
logic isn't what
always works in life

586
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:14,700
lt's time to do something drastic
and make Khanna toe our line

587
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:20,100
Till Khanna and that bloody Dev
don't agree...

588
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:22,200
l'm not budging from there

589
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:27,300
''All right, but whom will you
go with at this hour of the night?''

590
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:33,400
Leave that to me. Let me see
what stuff this Dev is made of

591
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:36,100
He has ruined our sleep

592
00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:48,500
An apple? Who's hurling
apples at me?

593
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:54,900
Who is it?

594
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:58,200
You?

595
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:00,700
''Hey driver, come down here''

596
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:03,500
''But l...
- Come down, l say''

597
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:19,700
''Madam, where are we going?
- Just drive along this road''

598
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:29,300
This road goes to Delhi.
- Really? We're going to Delhi too

599
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:33,100
What for?
- To meet Mr Khanna or his son

600
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:36,000
What...?
To meet Dev? Are you mad?

601
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:39,800
Why d'you stop the car
without a reason?

602
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:44,800
''ls it a disease? At this rate,
we won't make it to Delhi in 6 months''

603
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:47,600
Sure and what are you going
to achieve in Delhi anyway?

604
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:51,100
Take my advise. Let's return.
Mr Dev is not changing his decision

605
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:57,400
''ln that case, l'll give your Dev saheb
such a kung-fu punch...''

606
01:00:57,900 --> 01:01:00,800
he'll be exorcised
of the American smartness

607
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:06,200
You mean you'll give Dev a punch?
What are you worth?

608
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:08,700
A driver talking about worth!

609
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:12,000
You'll know my worth when
l give your Dev a nice kick

610
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:17,800
Oh really? Dev's enemy is my enemy.
And l don't drive for the enemy

611
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:20,200
Drive to Delhi on your own

612
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:23,500
''Oh sure, l will. Do you think
l can't drive a car?''

613
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,600
''What's the big deal anyway? Just start
the car, change the accelerator...''

614
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,700
step on the brakes...
- You'll know

615
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:35,100
''Look, driver!
Don't ever challenge me''

616
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:44,300
Why's this car going backwards?

617
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:53,500
''Delhi's on this side, Madam.
Not over there!''

618
01:01:53,900 --> 01:01:56,800
l know! And l wish l could
drive the car over Dev!

619
01:01:58,100 --> 01:02:00,000
Where's the car going?

620
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:04,800
What brake? Where is it?

621
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:24,400
''Are you okay, madam?
- Fix the car first!''

622
01:02:25,100 --> 01:02:27,100
l'll deal with you later

623
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:43,300
How much more time will it take?
- About 10 minutes

624
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:47,500
''Hurry up!
- Sure, that's what l'm doing''

625
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,500
She's so beautiful

626
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:05,900
What intoxication is this...?

627
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:10,900
''it appears as if
l'm falling in love''

628
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:34,300
''Pining is so much of fun, too...''

629
01:04:35,100 --> 01:04:39,900
''it appears as if
l'm falling in love''

630
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:14,700
''ln her eyes,
she has hidden me away...''

631
01:05:15,100 --> 01:05:20,000
''there's this lovely face
that has robbed me of my peace''

632
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:31,600
There's love in the air...

633
01:05:32,100 --> 01:05:37,500
''the gentle breeze
blows my scarf away''

634
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:45,700
''The one in my heart
is my beloved...''

635
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:51,400
''it appears as if
l'm falling in love''

636
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:31,500
''l'm beginning to go
crazy about you...''

637
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:37,000
''l'm being consumed by thoughts
hitherto alien to me''

638
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:48,700
l didn't even get to realise it...

639
01:06:49,100 --> 01:06:54,100
''when my desire for you
awakened''

640
01:06:57,800 --> 01:07:03,100
''There's a pain, there's an ache,
and there's a feeling of shyness...''

641
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:08,400
''l feel as if l'm
falling in love''

642
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:14,400
What intoxication is this?

643
01:07:15,100 --> 01:07:19,700
''l feel as if l'm
falling in love''

644
01:07:21,100 --> 01:07:26,100
Pining is so much of fun

645
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:31,400
''l feel as if l'm
falling in love''

646
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:34,800
l feel as if...

647
01:07:37,900 --> 01:07:40,600
l feel as if...

648
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:50,000
l'm falling in love

649
01:07:54,100 --> 01:07:57,100
l'm falling in love

650
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:12,400
''Driver! Hurry up!
- Coming, ma'am''

651
01:08:14,100 --> 01:08:16,100
''Quite a dangerous girl, l say''

652
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:27,800
''Murthy? lt's Dev, you idiot.''

653
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:31,400
''Now listen, there's this girl
coming with me to meet Papa''

654
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:34,000
''She mustn't get to meet him,
come what may''

655
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:36,200
Because l'm sure Papa will
fall into her trap

656
01:08:38,700 --> 01:08:40,200
l'm hanging up now

657
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:41,900
''Coming, Madam''

658
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:54,800
''Everything's taken care of!
- Okay, do something about the girl''

659
01:08:55,100 --> 01:08:57,400
Don't worry.
l'll handle her

660
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:04,100
''l'm here to meet either Mr Khanna
or his son, Dev''

661
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:10,900
Mr Khanna is asleep. And Dev
isn't at home right now

662
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:14,500
Please wake him up

663
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,400
Wake him up!

664
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:21,100
''l'm sorry, l can't even disturb him.
Please leave''

665
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:24,700
Leave...? What do you mean?

666
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:28,900
l haven't travelled 300 kilometers
to be asked to leave!

667
01:09:29,100 --> 01:09:31,600
''Calm down! Please don't
make a noise, Madam!''

668
01:09:31,900 --> 01:09:34,500
''No noise, you'll wake him up.
- That's just what l want!''

669
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:37,000
l'll do what l want to.
l'll shout and scream...

670
01:09:39,900 --> 01:09:41,200
Help!

671
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:44,600
Help!

672
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,200
Who's that girl?
- She's asking for a donation sir

673
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:49,600
Throw her out!
- l don't want any donation

674
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:53,100
''Driver, throw her out
- Excuse me, wait a minute...''

675
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,800
''Mr Khanna, please try to understand.
The people of Palampur...''

676
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:04,500
are eagerly waiting for you or Mr
Dev Khanna to do something for them

677
01:10:05,300 --> 01:10:10,200
''You have always helped them, sir
But will you desert them now?''

678
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:14,000
''Listen, my child...
- Don't let her mislead you, Dad!''

679
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:16,400
The poor girl is right

680
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:25,200
''l'm sorry, my dear. But Dev will
now do whatever needs to be done''

681
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:29,800
''Madam, we have sympathies for you.
But as we told you...''

682
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,800
this is Mr Dev's decision and
we can't do anything about it

683
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:36,000
''ln that case, l'll wait
for your Mr Dev...''

684
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:38,600
and not leave till that
idiot has changed his mind!

685
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:42,600
''There is the possibility of Dev
not returning all night, Madam''

686
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:45,300
l will wait for him forever!

687
01:10:47,100 --> 01:10:50,200
''You may wait for him as you like.
But here's wishing you a ''good night''

688
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:54,200
''l'm going to bed, too.
Wake me up, when you want to leave''

689
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:56,600
''Till then, tally-ho''

690
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:18,600
Listen child...

691
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:22,000
l have an idea.
- What idea?

692
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:26,600
That driver of yours...
- That moron?

693
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:32,800
''Whatever he is, l think
he looks a lot like Dev''

694
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:38,700
''ln fact, they resemble each other so
much, even we are deceived at times''

695
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:45,000
What are you trying to tell me?
- Suppose Dev does not turn up...

696
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:48,000
we could...
- We could...?

697
01:11:48,500 --> 01:11:50,800
we could perhaps...
- Perhaps...?

698
01:11:54,700 --> 01:12:00,300
One moment! Are you asking me to take
that moron back with me to Palampur...

699
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:02,100
as Dev?
- Oh yes

700
01:12:02,300 --> 01:12:04,500
What's wrong in doing that
for a couple of hours?

701
01:12:04,700 --> 01:12:07,700
''As soon as Dev returns, l'll have
a word with him...''

702
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:10,500
and bring him to Palampur too.
Everything will fall in place

703
01:12:21,100 --> 01:12:25,300
l'm now going to fix that driver

704
01:12:27,300 --> 01:12:30,300
So this is where the moron
is sleeping

705
01:12:31,300 --> 01:12:33,600
How dare he sleep
in his master's bed?

706
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,600
Lazybones! Wake up!

707
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:46,600
''Madam, ever since you've come
into my life, l've lost my sleep''

708
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:49,600
''That's all right. Get ready quickly,
we've got to leave''

709
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:52,300
And wear this. Go on

710
01:12:58,300 --> 01:13:01,300
My car-keys. lt'll take you
there faster

711
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:05,700
ls it okay if l call you uncle?

712
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:10,700
Why're you doing
all this for me?

713
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:15,700
And perhaps you're the only one
who can straighten out my crazy son

714
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:19,600
Your driver will arrive any moment.
l must leave

715
01:13:19,700 --> 01:13:20,900
One moment

716
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:28,300
You have my blessings

717
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:54,200
You're a handsome guy.
- Really?

718
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:56,400
''Happy now, Madam?''

719
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:00,400
Nobody will get to know
that you're not Dev

720
01:14:03,100 --> 01:14:05,400
There's something missing however.
- What?

721
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:09,900
''There's something Dev sports
on his face. l must, too''

722
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:16,700
What's this?
- Hold it

723
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:20,900
Boot-polish?
- Dev applies it on his face

724
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:24,000
What are you doing?
Have you gone mad?

725
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:29,100
Hold on... how do l look now?
Handsome? Gorgeous?

726
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:33,200
l'm not going with you as Dev
at any cost!

727
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:41,400
Have you gone nuts? Come here...
open the door!

728
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:03,900
Do you folks see that?
Does that open your eyes at last?

729
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:08,200
''Mr Khanna is coming...
his son Dev is coming''

730
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:11,000
''Has anyone turned up...?
No, sire!''

731
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:17,000
What more is she going to do
to occupy that chair?

732
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:22,600
lf you have any self-respect
or an iota of decency...

733
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:25,900
accept defeat and tender
your resignation!

734
01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:28,500
Yes!

735
01:15:35,300 --> 01:15:38,600
''Ma, Shalu is here!
There's someone else with her''

736
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:47,500
''Where are the two of them...?
- ln that room, Madam''

737
01:15:49,900 --> 01:15:54,300
''Shalu! Open the door! Quick!
- Coming, sis!''

738
01:15:54,700 --> 01:15:56,700
Please Anand! Why don't you agree?

739
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:01,600
''This is a very serious matter
- Now listen, you chit of a girl!''

740
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
l brought you here only
at Mr Khanna's orders

741
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,100
l'll never be a part
of this farce

742
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:10,900
''A farce? The city's about to be
devastated, and you call it a farce?''

743
01:16:11,700 --> 01:16:14,300
lt's all the results of the
wrong decisions Dev has taken

744
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:16,400
Wrong decisions? Dev?

745
01:16:16,900 --> 01:16:20,900
He has studied in America. He has
a first-class first degree!

746
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:25,400
What good is a degree that severs his
relationship with other human beings?

747
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:29,900
''lf this factory closes down,
many families will go to seed''

748
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:32,900
People will be forced
to sell their land

749
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:36,600
''ln just a moment, the whole
of this city will be destroyed''

750
01:16:41,700 --> 01:16:42,900
''Come here, Anand''

751
01:16:46,700 --> 01:16:49,100
Look at that small child

752
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:51,600
Will anyone be able to
return his smile to him?

753
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:54,100
And that old farmer...

754
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:59,800
''he wonders what will happen of him,
if he's compelled to sell his land''

755
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:04,200
''Where will he go? How will he
start life afresh, at this age?''

756
01:17:08,900 --> 01:17:12,600
Can't you feel their pain
and their suffering?

757
01:17:14,100 --> 01:17:16,500
Can't you see the tears
they suppress in their eyes?

758
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:21,600
lf l ever get to meet Dev and
come face to face with him...

759
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:23,800
''there's one question,
l'll surely ask him:''

760
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:27,600
What good is his study in America
or his degrees and theories...

761
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:31,100
if he can't give these troubled people
any hope in life?

762
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:37,600
''Every man standing downstairs,
every woman and every farmer...''

763
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:43,000
wait in the hope that Dev will bring
a ray of hope for them...

764
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:46,900
and fill their lives with joy.
- l'll fill their lives with joy

765
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:51,600
l will.
l promise to play Dev for you

766
01:17:55,100 --> 01:17:59,100
Should you even ask me to pluck
the stars from the skies today...

767
01:17:59,900 --> 01:18:01,700
l'll do that for you

768
01:18:03,900 --> 01:18:05,600
l always misunderstood you

769
01:18:06,300 --> 01:18:11,300
But whatever you are...
you're wonderful

770
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:19,400
''Sarita, why the suspense?
Where is Dev Khanna?''

771
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:22,300
Mr Mittal... here l am

772
01:18:29,700 --> 01:18:33,000
''Have you gone mad, Shalu?
This poor chap is Anand!''

773
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:35,100
Really? l didn't know at all!

774
01:18:35,700 --> 01:18:39,300
''How did you turn Anand into Dev?
- No tension, Nimmi''

775
01:18:39,700 --> 01:18:41,700
l'll be a better Dev
than Dev is!

776
01:18:46,700 --> 01:18:48,900
and my dear farmer brothers

777
01:18:52,700 --> 01:18:55,400
What l couldn't learn in America
is that...

778
01:18:55,700 --> 01:18:59,800
one must value sentiments
in one's business dealings

779
01:19:00,700 --> 01:19:05,000
''What America could not teach me,
your city Palampur has taught me''

780
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:09,800
lsn't he talking too much?

781
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:15,400
''l assure you, l will pull your city
out of the path of difficulties...''

782
01:19:15,700 --> 01:19:17,700
and place it on the path of progress

783
01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:24,000
What's wrong with our people?
They're applauding every dialogue

784
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:29,400
And this is no empty promise.
The biggest proof is that...

785
01:19:29,700 --> 01:19:34,400
instead of 800 Rupees for
every quintal of apples...

786
01:19:34,700 --> 01:19:37,700
l'll pay you 1000 Rupees
for every quintal

787
01:19:40,700 --> 01:19:43,400
Has he gone mad? He's going to
make us sink with him!

788
01:19:43,700 --> 01:19:47,400
Did you teach him all that?
- l asked him to okay 800 Rupees

789
01:19:47,700 --> 01:19:49,400
But the idiot is going berserk

790
01:19:49,700 --> 01:19:54,700
This chap is doing a somersault.
l find it all very fishy

791
01:19:55,500 --> 01:19:58,300
Find out from Roopchand and Khoobchand
what this is all about

792
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:01,400
There's some more good news

793
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:03,700
What's coming now?

794
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:08,400
We're going to launch a new product.
An apple-juice...

795
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:12,700
unrivalled by any other fruit juice
or soft drink

796
01:20:13,100 --> 01:20:15,400
And we'll call it...

797
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:17,800
Refresh

798
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:25,600
He couldn't have thought of all that.
You must certainly have tutored him!

799
01:20:25,900 --> 01:20:29,200
''Believe me, sis!
He's making it all up!''

800
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:31,400
''lf l knew he'd do this,
l wouldn't have brought him here''

801
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:35,600
l'm going to beat him to pulp and
serve him to people in a soft drink!

802
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,500
''Come, sir... come
- Where?''

803
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:40,300
Over there

804
01:20:41,700 --> 01:20:45,000
''He's a driver!
- lnspector, arrest him''

805
01:20:46,300 --> 01:20:48,800
He even looks like a fraud!
- He's a driver

806
01:20:49,100 --> 01:20:51,100
He's fooling everyone
by impersonating Dev

807
01:20:51,700 --> 01:20:55,400
''lnspector, l'm Dev Khanna.
Dinesh Khanna's son''

808
01:20:55,700 --> 01:20:58,700
He's Dinesh Khanna's driver's son.
- Don't you lie!

809
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:02,200
That's impossible!
My daughter would never lie

810
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:05,800
''But she has already lied, lady!
- Try a slap. He'll squeal!''

811
01:21:07,900 --> 01:21:11,000
Are you the driver?
- Speak only the truth

812
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:14,600
''lnspector, how do l convince you
that l'm Dev Khanna!''

813
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:21,800
''Not me, not anyone in this hall will
believe that you are Dev Khanna''

814
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:40,500
''Shalu, tell me the truth.
He's Dev, isn't he? Mr Khanna's son?''

815
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:44,700
''Or is he a driver?
- Shalu, l'm Dev!''

816
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:47,200
''l'm Dev, Shalu!''

817
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:54,500
''Look at me and answer me, Shalu.
- So this is Dev Khanna''

818
01:21:54,900 --> 01:21:57,500
To Dev Khanna...
- Glory be!

819
01:22:08,900 --> 01:22:10,700
Here's my resignation

820
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:35,600
l only wanted to help you

821
01:22:37,700 --> 01:22:40,000
Don't ever try to help me again

822
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,600
Mr Khanna? You?

823
01:22:48,700 --> 01:22:50,400
How're you feeling now?
- l'm okay

824
01:22:50,700 --> 01:22:52,200
Let me go! Leave me alone!

825
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:01,200
Dad! Am l glad you're here!

826
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:04,500
They just don't believe
that l'm your son

827
01:23:04,900 --> 01:23:06,600
Tell them the truth!

828
01:23:08,900 --> 01:23:13,600
''Yes, he's my son. Dev.
- Hear that? Know who l am?''

829
01:23:14,900 --> 01:23:17,700
''Out of my way, please.
And you wanted to be the Mayor''

830
01:23:18,100 --> 01:23:19,900
He's really Dev Khanna

831
01:23:22,900 --> 01:23:25,500
Now let's quietly get out of here

832
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:30,000
So you folks now believe
that l'm Dev Khanna?

833
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:34,000
And l did not make false
promises to you

834
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:42,000
l'm proud of him for whatever
he has done for you today

835
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:47,300
''l assure you, that the two of us,
father and son...''

836
01:23:47,900 --> 01:23:49,900
will fulfill the promises together

837
01:24:03,100 --> 01:24:07,400
''Mr Khanna, meet Sameer.
He's an amazing ventriloquist''

838
01:24:07,700 --> 01:24:09,700
He has just returned
from a tour of Japan

839
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,700
He has made a great name out there.
- Really? Well done

840
01:24:19,900 --> 01:24:23,300
''l'm glad you're here, Mama!
- Aren't you ready yet, Nimmi?''

841
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:27,400
''l don't know what to wear, Mama.
- Wear this one''

842
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:30,100
''lt'll look very nice on you.
- No, l've worn that several times''

843
01:24:31,100 --> 01:24:33,600
''ln that case, wear this one.
lt's brand new''

844
01:24:33,900 --> 01:24:36,600
l don't have matching ear-rings.
- So wear something...

845
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:40,400
that has matching ear-rings.
You're being awaited downstairs.

846
01:24:40,700 --> 01:24:42,400
''Who, Mama? Dev?''

847
01:24:43,700 --> 01:24:47,300
Yes. How did you get to know?

848
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,300
''Mama, l'll get ready and
be downstairs in 10 minutes''

849
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:52,600
10 minutes? That's too late

850
01:24:52,900 --> 01:24:55,400
He says he's in a hurry.
Maybe he's got to go somewhere

851
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,600
''Don't let him leave, Mama.
l'll be down there in 2 minutes''

852
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:24,400
This is the second time...
- What's the excuse now?

853
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:27,400
l was only looking up the house.
lt's very beautiful

854
01:25:27,700 --> 01:25:29,700
Looking up the house or were you
looking for someone?

855
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,600
Looking for someone... ? Oh no

856
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,600
You reacted as if l caught
you stealing something

857
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
What are you talking about?
- So what were you stealing?

858
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:40,100
''l mean it, l didn't...
- Tell me, quick''

859
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:50,000
''How will someone, who has lost
everything, ever steal something?''

860
01:25:53,100 --> 01:25:55,100
You're looking great today

861
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:17,400
Who is it?

862
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:39,600
You? How did you get in?

863
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:43,000
Simple. By pressing enter

864
01:26:43,700 --> 01:26:46,700
Will you press exit and take
the trouble of going out?

865
01:26:48,100 --> 01:26:52,200
''lf you don't like me coming here,
l'll go away''

866
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:57,300
l didn't know my driver would
be offended so quickly

867
01:26:58,100 --> 01:27:01,500
''By the way, if you wish, you
can stay here for 2 minutes''

868
01:27:01,900 --> 01:27:05,700
2 minutes? 2 minutes will pass
even as we discuss the weather

869
01:27:06,100 --> 01:27:09,500
Really? There are more interesting
things to talk about...

870
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:13,800
apart from the weather.
- Such as?

871
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:17,400
Such as what you said to me
at the Town Hall yesterday

872
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:20,300
l did? l can't remember anything

873
01:27:24,100 --> 01:27:26,900
''l'd even pluck the stars
from the skies for you''

874
01:27:27,300 --> 01:27:28,400
Remember?

875
01:27:29,800 --> 01:27:31,500
l wasn't lying

876
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:33,800
lt's 2 minutes already
and l must leave

877
01:27:36,100 --> 01:27:38,900
''You can't leave this
moment unfinished, Dev''

878
01:27:40,200 --> 01:27:42,100
''When did l ever want
to leave, Shalu?''

879
01:27:43,100 --> 01:27:46,900
These are the moments in which
l get to caress your breath...

880
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:51,400
in which l see a wonderful person.
These moments can never pass

881
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:56,200
''You'll always find them frozen in time.
- Enough. Say nothing more, Dev''

882
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,800
Whatever it is...

883
01:28:00,200 --> 01:28:02,900
this is the most beautiful moment
of my life

884
01:28:03,100 --> 01:28:05,200
And l don't want to lose it ever

885
01:28:06,900 --> 01:28:09,100
You came into my life
as a stranger...

886
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:11,800
but you own it now

887
01:28:22,200 --> 01:28:24,200
Sameer! You're back!

888
01:29:18,200 --> 01:29:19,300
Love

889
01:29:20,200 --> 01:29:23,200
''Faith gives peace
to the heart''

890
01:29:23,500 --> 01:29:24,600
Love

891
01:29:26,100 --> 01:29:29,200
Wait torments the heart

892
01:29:29,900 --> 01:29:33,100
''My love, tonight l see...''

893
01:29:33,500 --> 01:29:36,200
love in your eyes

894
01:30:42,200 --> 01:30:48,200
''Love is an intoxicating desire...
perhaps unknown to you''

895
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:56,300
''Only those in love know,
oh, what fun it is''

896
01:30:57,300 --> 01:31:04,300
''ln love, we meet,
and we part too''

897
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:11,300
''Love knows the colour of faith,
and treachery too''

898
01:31:12,500 --> 01:31:19,300
''Crazed lovers live for love,
and die for love''

899
01:31:27,200 --> 01:31:28,300
Love...

900
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:32,900
is the right of the heart

901
01:31:33,200 --> 01:31:34,400
Love...

902
01:31:35,200 --> 01:31:38,900
the longing tortures the heart

903
01:32:17,400 --> 01:32:23,400
''Facts, buried in love.
And tales too''

904
01:32:25,100 --> 01:32:31,300
''Someone smiles,
someone is brought to tears''

905
01:32:32,300 --> 01:32:38,300
''lf there's restlessness,
there's solace in love too''

906
01:32:40,300 --> 01:32:46,300
''There's a victory in love,
a sense of loss too''

907
01:32:47,900 --> 01:32:54,300
''Lovers love to perish
in the flame of love''

908
01:33:02,900 --> 01:33:04,000
Love...

909
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:08,000
makes the heart pine

910
01:33:08,300 --> 01:33:09,500
Love...

911
01:33:10,600 --> 01:33:13,800
the wait is killing

912
01:33:14,200 --> 01:33:15,300
Love...

913
01:33:16,600 --> 01:33:19,200
gives solace to the heart

914
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:20,700
Love...

915
01:33:22,100 --> 01:33:25,300
the wait tortures the heart

916
01:33:26,100 --> 01:33:29,400
''My love, tonight l see...''

917
01:33:30,300 --> 01:33:32,300
love in your eyes

918
01:34:30,900 --> 01:34:36,300
Where's Shalu? Haven't seen her all day.
- She left for work early

919
01:34:36,700 --> 01:34:41,600
They're preparing for a product launch.
She's so dedicated

920
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:46,000
But you don't feel like working?
- Come on Mamma

921
01:34:46,500 --> 01:34:49,100
What time is it?

922
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:54,100
Here you are sitting and humming away
instead of going to work? What gives?

923
01:34:56,200 --> 01:35:05,000
''Sometimes, l feel like being alone.
Goodness! What are you making of it?''

924
01:35:05,800 --> 01:35:10,600
''Princess, l'm your mother. 9 months
you lived in my womb''

925
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:14,300
And you've grown to all of 22
right in front of my eyes

926
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,700
''Sweetheart, l even know
how your heart beats''

927
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:23,000
''Then l've nothing to hide from you,
go on, ask me whatever you want''

928
01:35:25,100 --> 01:35:31,000
Are you in love with Dev?
You must tell me the truth

929
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,200
l don't know.
- Don't you?

930
01:35:35,800 --> 01:35:41,800
''Actually l love talking to him,
listening to him''

931
01:35:42,500 --> 01:35:47,400
''When l'm with him, l feel lost
and when he isn't around...''

932
01:35:48,100 --> 01:35:53,100
''all l think of is him,
weaving fantasies''

933
01:35:54,300 --> 01:35:58,800
ls that how you thought of Papa?
- Yes it happened

934
01:36:01,100 --> 01:36:03,400
Papa loved you very much?

935
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:12,200
Dev is a very nice boy.
He will make you very happy

936
01:36:17,700 --> 01:36:22,700
Welcome to the biggest and
most unique fruit juice launch ever

937
01:36:23,100 --> 01:36:25,800
You'll be happy to know what
market research says

938
01:36:26,100 --> 01:36:29,400
Refresh can take on any brand
in this country

939
01:36:29,700 --> 01:36:34,800
l'll show you how the best quality
juices are produced in our factory

940
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:40,300
Nice beginning.
- Wait and watch

941
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:45,100
l can't take my eyes off a beauty

942
01:36:47,300 --> 01:36:49,200
Your father is staring

943
01:36:53,800 --> 01:36:58,600
This drink was sampled here and abroad.
Here are the responses

944
01:37:10,900 --> 01:37:13,500
lt's got up.
- Must be actors on pay

945
01:37:15,300 --> 01:37:18,500
what to do with them?
- Rip off and get rid

946
01:37:22,200 --> 01:37:26,500
''For the sake of product recall,
multinationals spend millions...''

947
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:29,300
''using filmstars, cricketers, models''

948
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:33,800
But we want to do different...

949
01:37:34,200 --> 01:37:37,200
absolutely original.
We're using a star...

950
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:41,300
who has given our city
a new identity

951
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:47,500
Our country is proud of you

952
01:37:50,300 --> 01:37:52,600
As if they've roped in
a film star

953
01:37:58,600 --> 01:38:02,300
Thank you for selecting me
as your product mascot

954
01:38:02,700 --> 01:38:05,000
''Not you! They've chosen me, moron''

955
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:12,300
So let's make Refresh
the greatest juice in the world

956
01:38:13,300 --> 01:38:16,200
Got to prove a point!
Let's get to work

957
01:38:18,900 --> 01:38:23,700
''After years, l feel the same
enthusiasm l had...''

958
01:38:24,200 --> 01:38:28,900
when l started this factory.
l want us to work hard...

959
01:38:29,200 --> 01:38:33,900
to make a success of this launch.
And like our mascot says...

960
01:38:34,200 --> 01:38:37,400
Got to prove a point!
So let's get to work

961
01:39:13,500 --> 01:39:20,300
''There's fun in the air,
and the colour of love''

962
01:39:21,300 --> 01:39:29,100
''You know what
my heartbeat says?''

963
01:39:30,300 --> 01:39:37,000
''From now, my love,
my heart is yours''

964
01:40:51,900 --> 01:40:56,400
''Secretly, l have loved you...''

965
01:41:00,200 --> 01:41:03,400
''it's true, sweetheart''

966
01:41:08,600 --> 01:41:12,500
How you made me pine...

967
01:41:16,400 --> 01:41:20,400
l can't tell you in words

968
01:41:23,500 --> 01:41:31,400
''Nobody knows
how we fell in love''

969
01:41:33,100 --> 01:41:40,400
''l love nobody
more than l love you''

970
01:41:41,100 --> 01:41:48,400
''You know what
my heartbeat says?''

971
01:41:49,700 --> 01:41:55,900
''From now, my love,
my heart is yours''

972
01:42:47,300 --> 01:42:52,500
Love is in the air

973
01:42:55,500 --> 01:43:00,500
l'm lost

974
01:43:03,500 --> 01:43:08,500
l'm lost in my dreams

975
01:43:09,900 --> 01:43:14,500
l'm crazy

976
01:43:17,400 --> 01:43:24,500
''l don't think
l can live without you''

977
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:32,500
''You know what
my heartbeat says?''

978
01:43:34,500 --> 01:43:41,500
''From now, my love,
my heart is yours''

979
01:43:50,300 --> 01:43:57,500
''There's fun in the air,
and the colour of love''

980
01:43:58,600 --> 01:44:05,600
''You know what
my heartbeat says?''

981
01:44:07,400 --> 01:44:13,600
''From now, my love,
my heart is yours''

982
01:44:39,600 --> 01:44:42,400
Table booked
at the Chinese restaurant?

983
01:44:43,600 --> 01:44:44,900
Everyone gone?

984
01:44:50,700 --> 01:44:57,100
''What a scoundrel you are!
Look, when the factory is mine...''

985
01:44:57,600 --> 01:45:00,400
l'll make you my manager!
- Thanks boss

986
01:45:00,800 --> 01:45:05,600
lt's important for us
that the launch fails

987
01:45:06,600 --> 01:45:13,100
Suck Khanna lndustries dry
at double speed

988
01:45:13,600 --> 01:45:18,300
Everything's ready for tonight.
How many trucks do we engage?

989
01:45:18,600 --> 01:45:22,400
Enough to empty all the godowns

990
01:45:28,500 --> 01:45:30,000
Here we are

991
01:45:31,300 --> 01:45:33,600
''Hurry up and come down.
- Coming, sir''

992
01:45:37,500 --> 01:45:43,400
Tell them to hurry up. All trucks
must be out in half an hour

993
01:45:43,800 --> 01:45:45,700
Will be done

994
01:45:47,700 --> 01:45:51,100
So many traitors?
- Now l know...

995
01:45:51,500 --> 01:45:53,900
where all the profits
are going

996
01:45:54,800 --> 01:45:59,400
Khanna lndustries was
never making losses

997
01:45:59,700 --> 01:46:04,300
These guys were
lining their pockets

998
01:46:05,700 --> 01:46:11,500
''They cheated us, the farmers
and all of Palampur''

999
01:46:25,700 --> 01:46:29,800
ls my son speaking the truth?

1000
01:46:36,400 --> 01:46:40,900
''l took you for a brother,
l trusted you''

1001
01:46:41,800 --> 01:46:46,400
How could you stoop so low?
- My brother is innocent

1002
01:46:46,700 --> 01:46:51,000
He didn't know what's going on.
l'm the real traitor

1003
01:46:51,300 --> 01:46:53,100
''Brother...
- Not a word, brother''

1004
01:46:53,400 --> 01:46:55,100
For the sake of our mother

1005
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,700
l stabbed you in the back
for my gain

1006
01:47:02,700 --> 01:47:07,700
lt's as big a shock for you
as it is for me

1007
01:47:08,800 --> 01:47:15,200
You brother has hurt me.
But now...

1008
01:47:15,800 --> 01:47:20,000
my son is managing this factory.
lt's going to be his decision

1009
01:47:21,800 --> 01:47:26,400
Lost the gamble!
My brother has been jailed

1010
01:47:26,800 --> 01:47:31,100
You've lost no gamble. Just one
thorn out of our way...

1011
01:47:31,400 --> 01:47:33,200
and the factory is ours

1012
01:47:36,800 --> 01:47:41,500
Look! He's coming straight at us

1013
01:47:46,900 --> 01:47:49,600
''Good! lf you say so,
l'll run him over''

1014
01:47:50,800 --> 01:47:54,500
No! My brother is in jail!
Things could get worse

1015
01:47:54,800 --> 01:47:59,300
No better a chance! Say yes!
- No

1016
01:48:06,800 --> 01:48:11,500
He threw your brother in jail.
l'll send him to heaven

1017
01:48:11,800 --> 01:48:13,000
No

1018
01:48:45,600 --> 01:48:47,300
How did this happen?

1019
01:48:47,800 --> 01:48:50,600
Are you all right?
- Minor bruises

1020
01:48:51,200 --> 01:48:55,200
Minor? What did the doctor say?
- You didn't inform Ma?

1021
01:48:55,900 --> 01:48:58,200
''She's away on important work,
she will get worried''

1022
01:48:58,600 --> 01:49:01,000
Don't telephone her.
- l didn't. Relax

1023
01:49:01,600 --> 01:49:04,500
Don't worry about your sister.
l'm taking care of her

1024
01:49:04,900 --> 01:49:07,900
Am l taking good care of you?
- Yes

1025
01:49:53,900 --> 01:49:57,600
Seeing you after 4 days!
- And l'm seeing you...

1026
01:49:57,900 --> 01:50:03,900
''after 4 days, 8 hours,
31 minutes and 5 seconds''

1027
01:50:04,900 --> 01:50:10,900
Don't ask me how hard every second was.
- ln memory of me...

1028
01:50:11,300 --> 01:50:15,900
l hope you haven't built a Taj Mahal?
- No Taj Mahal

1029
01:50:16,800 --> 01:50:22,300
''But something beautiful. For you.
- Tell me, what?''

1030
01:50:22,600 --> 01:50:25,700
''lt's something.
- Come on, show me''

1031
01:50:26,100 --> 01:50:29,600
Couldn't fit in my pocket.
So l sent it home for you

1032
01:50:29,900 --> 01:50:31,000
Home...?

1033
01:50:34,900 --> 01:50:38,700
Screaming won't get it in.
Tilt it to a side

1034
01:50:39,100 --> 01:50:40,100
Careful

1035
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,800
Such a huge gift?
Who's this crazy?

1036
01:50:45,500 --> 01:50:47,500
Open it up. Fast

1037
01:51:02,800 --> 01:51:04,500
Who sent it?

1038
01:51:12,100 --> 01:51:15,500
Swear that you love me

1039
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,300
l love you Dev! l swear

1040
01:52:03,900 --> 01:52:05,500
Look! What a gift!

1041
01:52:06,800 --> 01:52:10,500
is true?
- You think it's a dream?

1042
01:52:43,200 --> 01:52:46,500
Swear when you say...

1043
01:52:48,100 --> 01:52:50,500
smile when you say...

1044
01:52:52,400 --> 01:52:54,900
say with all your heart...

1045
01:52:56,400 --> 01:52:58,800
come into my arms when you say...

1046
01:53:01,400 --> 01:53:04,900
you love me

1047
01:53:17,100 --> 01:53:20,200
Say it even if you're shy...

1048
01:53:21,300 --> 01:53:24,300
say it even if it staggers you...

1049
01:53:25,400 --> 01:53:28,100
and whether you mean it or not...

1050
01:53:30,100 --> 01:53:32,600
just keep saying it...

1051
01:53:34,700 --> 01:53:38,900
you love me

1052
01:54:21,400 --> 01:54:29,000
''When l see you, a strange desire
stirs my heart''

1053
01:54:29,700 --> 01:54:37,200
''Whenever l see you,
l want to love you''

1054
01:54:39,300 --> 01:54:47,200
''Love me, say you love me,
in every breath''

1055
01:54:48,200 --> 01:54:56,200
''Love me day and night.
love me in my dreams''

1056
01:54:58,500 --> 01:55:01,200
''Say it when
you're avoiding my eyes...''

1057
01:55:02,200 --> 01:55:05,300
''say it when
you're looking into my eyes...''

1058
01:55:06,400 --> 01:55:09,300
and whether you mean it or not...

1059
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,400
just keep saying it...

1060
01:55:15,800 --> 01:55:19,700
you love me

1061
01:55:56,200 --> 01:56:03,500
''Thinking of you
makes me pine''

1062
01:56:04,300 --> 01:56:11,300
''Ever since l fell in love
not a moment l've been at peace''

1063
01:56:14,300 --> 01:56:21,900
''What being in love means,
l can't tell you in words''

1064
01:56:22,800 --> 01:56:30,300
''Never stay out of my sight,
my love''

1065
01:56:33,500 --> 01:56:36,000
''Say it even if you're too proud
to admit it...''

1066
01:56:37,300 --> 01:56:40,100
and dazzle me when you say it...

1067
01:56:41,300 --> 01:56:44,100
whether you mean it or not...

1068
01:56:45,500 --> 01:56:48,300
just keep saying it...

1069
01:56:50,900 --> 01:56:54,300
you love me

1070
01:57:25,900 --> 01:57:32,900
Shalu! l'm so happy today!
And it's all because of you

1071
01:57:33,400 --> 01:57:36,400
''lf not for you, Dev wouldn't be
in my boutique...''

1072
01:57:36,700 --> 01:57:39,800
l wouldn't fall into his arms
or looked into his eyes...

1073
01:57:40,200 --> 01:57:44,200
l wouldn't be in love and
this gift would never be mine

1074
01:57:44,500 --> 01:57:50,700
Shalu l love him dearly! But l didn't
know that he loves me too

1075
01:57:51,100 --> 01:57:55,300
''But he was so caring in the hospital,
he spent so much time with me...''

1076
01:57:55,600 --> 01:57:59,700
it was the most beautiful day
in my life. And now this gift...

1077
01:58:00,100 --> 01:58:04,400
''l think l'm going crazy!
Shalu, come downstairs''

1078
01:58:10,200 --> 01:58:11,200
Sure Di

1079
01:58:31,300 --> 01:58:35,100
What a joy! The two of you
love each other so dearly

1080
01:59:05,200 --> 01:59:06,500
What happened?

1081
01:59:08,200 --> 01:59:10,800
But what happened?
- Come with me

1082
01:59:11,200 --> 01:59:14,500
What's up Nimmi?
- l must show you something

1083
01:59:15,500 --> 01:59:18,800
What do you want to show me?
- Look Mamma

1084
01:59:22,200 --> 01:59:25,000
Such a huge gift? From Dev?

1085
01:59:32,400 --> 01:59:36,900
Should l speak to Mr Khanna?
- What's the hurry?

1086
01:59:39,300 --> 01:59:46,100
l can see the eagerness in your eyes.
And that's proof of how crazy he is

1087
01:59:46,500 --> 01:59:50,000
l'm going to talk to Mr Khanna
about your wedding right away

1088
01:59:53,500 --> 01:59:57,200
Where have you been all day?
Dev has been looking for you

1089
01:59:57,500 --> 02:00:02,200
The launch deadlines... tell Dev
l'll see him in 5 minutes

1090
02:00:02,500 --> 02:00:04,800
Make sure. Or he'll kill me

1091
02:00:12,400 --> 02:00:17,700
Can we prepone the bank appointment?
l'll see you in 5 minutes

1092
02:00:19,600 --> 02:00:22,100
Where's Shalu?
- ln her office

1093
02:00:23,500 --> 02:00:26,100
l've been looking forever!
- She's right here

1094
02:00:26,600 --> 02:00:31,200
Where is she?
- She was here. Has she vanished?

1095
02:00:32,200 --> 02:00:33,900
l don't get this...

1096
02:00:38,600 --> 02:00:40,500
All day you've been playing
hide n seek with me

1097
02:00:41,500 --> 02:00:47,300
You got me into this launch.
- Can't spare a minute for me?

1098
02:00:48,300 --> 02:00:52,200
l've got to get the designs approved
and the deadline is coming up

1099
02:00:52,600 --> 02:00:56,400
l'm too busy to eat! Spare me.
- l haven't eaten either

1100
02:00:56,700 --> 02:01:00,200
Let's go and eat in the canteen.
- No Dev

1101
02:01:00,600 --> 02:01:02,700
Must be a Wednesday special

1102
02:01:03,400 --> 02:01:05,600
''Mr Roopchand, later''

1103
02:01:12,500 --> 02:01:19,600
''You're shy, as if l'm a stranger.
You didn't like my gift?''

1104
02:01:20,600 --> 02:01:25,300
''No, it's exotic.
- Not more than you are''

1105
02:01:27,100 --> 02:01:36,100
Do you know when l fell for you?
When you took me to Delhi

1106
02:01:36,700 --> 02:01:43,700
You spoke of the stars and the moon
and you asked me what they're about

1107
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:52,600
''On that moonlit night,
you looked prettier than the Moon''

1108
02:01:54,700 --> 02:01:59,400
''From that moment,
l've been in love with you''

1109
02:02:03,400 --> 02:02:05,400
l'll see you after
l've delivered these artworks

1110
02:02:10,600 --> 02:02:15,000
What's come over her? Have you noticed
she has been avoiding me all day

1111
02:02:15,300 --> 02:02:19,600
But why is she avoiding you?
- No idea. And Dad wants me...

1112
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:23,300
to bring her home this evening.
- At home? But 5 minutes ago...

1113
02:02:23,700 --> 02:02:26,600
she was telling me
she's going to the bank

1114
02:02:30,300 --> 02:02:35,300
l don't now what to do... idea!
- What?

1115
02:02:35,700 --> 02:02:37,700
l'll use the ploy of going to
the bank to take her home

1116
02:02:57,400 --> 02:03:02,700
Not meant to be used there!
- You won't understand

1117
02:03:03,400 --> 02:03:05,400
''When in love, you got to''

1118
02:03:13,500 --> 02:03:18,100
Murthy will see you in the bank.
l'll drop you there

1119
02:03:18,500 --> 02:03:22,000
No Dev... what happened to your tie?
- My tie?

1120
02:03:23,800 --> 02:03:28,500
The cake! How did it happen?
l'll change in 2 minutes at home

1121
02:03:28,800 --> 02:03:32,600
''No Dev! You go home, l'll take a cab.
- No way''

1122
02:03:33,900 --> 02:03:39,200
Can't cab it as long as
your lifetime-driver is with you

1123
02:03:39,800 --> 02:03:43,200
l'm taking you
wherever you're going

1124
02:03:43,800 --> 02:03:48,100
''After l returned from America,
my son put me on a liquid diet''

1125
02:03:48,800 --> 02:03:51,500
''This is a nice excuse, Ms Sarita.
Won't you help yourself, please?''

1126
02:03:51,800 --> 02:03:53,900
Nice excuse for you.
Help yourself

1127
02:03:56,600 --> 02:04:01,200
''Mr Khanna, l'd like to discuss
something important with you''

1128
02:04:01,900 --> 02:04:06,800
''Yes, tell me.
- Only l don't know...''

1129
02:04:07,600 --> 02:04:11,800
where to begin.
We've known each other for years

1130
02:04:12,100 --> 02:04:19,200
l'd appreciate it if...
- lf... your daughter marries my son

1131
02:04:19,700 --> 02:04:27,000
You want that too?
- l've been wanting to talk to you

1132
02:04:27,700 --> 02:04:35,100
''You said half, l said half.
- l didn't know how to bring it up''

1133
02:04:35,800 --> 02:04:41,000
Dev and Nimmi love each other dearly
so who are we to stop them?

1134
02:04:41,900 --> 02:04:44,600
What happened? Have some water

1135
02:04:54,900 --> 02:05:00,900
''Mr Khanna, l want to tell you
that Nimmi is a loving daughter''

1136
02:05:01,900 --> 02:05:06,500
l'm sure she will be as loving
as a daughter-in-law

1137
02:05:06,900 --> 02:05:13,300
lndeed... Nimmi is a lovable child

1138
02:05:14,100 --> 02:05:19,600
Then it's final?
- Well...

1139
02:05:20,700 --> 02:05:25,100
Many thanks. May l take your leave?
- But... Ms Sarita...

1140
02:05:25,900 --> 02:05:30,600
l'd like to match their horoscopes
for the peace of my mind

1141
02:05:30,900 --> 02:05:35,100
Of course they will match.
l'll send you Nimmi's horoscope

1142
02:05:35,700 --> 02:05:37,700
l'll be leaving now

1143
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:47,600
''Hello Ms Sarita!
- Hello, how are you Mr Roopchand?''

1144
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:51,700
''The same, but not too well.
- Why, what's the matter?''

1145
02:05:52,100 --> 02:05:56,600
''Ever since my brother went to jail,
it's been embarrassing and worrisome''

1146
02:05:57,000 --> 02:06:03,600
You look very happy.
- Dev is going to marry Nimmi

1147
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:05,000
What...?
- Yes

1148
02:06:05,300 --> 02:06:07,500
Dev and Nimmi?
- Yes

1149
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,600
Congratulations.
- Thanks

1150
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:17,300
Great news! Nimmi and Mr Dev
will be a perfect match

1151
02:06:17,700 --> 02:06:21,700
But there's something...
- What is it?

1152
02:06:22,100 --> 02:06:26,800
''No, l mustn't speak of it...
- Come clean''

1153
02:06:27,100 --> 02:06:31,600
''No doubt, Nimmi and Dev
are made for each other''

1154
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:35,700
But many a slip between cup and lip.
- What do you mean?

1155
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:41,400
''l hate telling you this, but Shalu's
behaviour at the office is no good''

1156
02:06:41,700 --> 02:06:42,700
What...?
- Yes

1157
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:46,700
One mustn't be seducing
her sister's fiance

1158
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:51,700
And Dev is but human.
- What are you saying?

1159
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:56,700
''l won't lie, l'm a praying man.
Today they were inside the lift''

1160
02:06:57,000 --> 02:07:01,400
And they refused to let me in!
Shut themselves inside the lift

1161
02:07:01,700 --> 02:07:06,300
lt has become an everyday affair.
- This is preposterous

1162
02:07:06,800 --> 02:07:12,400
''You can ask anyone at the office.
Excuse me, l'm seeing the boss''

1163
02:07:12,700 --> 02:07:19,400
Dev and Shalu... l mean Nimmi and Dev
God bless the pair

1164
02:07:38,200 --> 02:07:40,700
''No Dev, please!
- Shalu, what's come over you?''

1165
02:07:41,100 --> 02:07:43,500
''Dev, let me go. Some other time...
- Please, listen to me.''

1166
02:07:43,800 --> 02:07:46,300
''No Dev, please.
- Just meet Dad''

1167
02:08:30,300 --> 02:08:32,300
No Shalu...
- Please! Let me go

1168
02:08:33,200 --> 02:08:38,500
''You must tell me, what happened?
Why have you changed overnight?''

1169
02:08:39,100 --> 02:08:42,500
Why have you been avoiding me?
- l'll tell you some other time

1170
02:08:43,100 --> 02:08:49,100
''Shalu, have l said something wrong?
- No Dev''

1171
02:10:37,400 --> 02:10:44,800
''You see Shekhar? Mother and daughter
laughing at me, they're ridiculing me''

1172
02:10:46,400 --> 02:10:50,600
''20 years ago, that woman took away
all the happiness in my life''

1173
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:59,300
She wrecked my home! Now her daughter
is robbing our daughter of her joys

1174
02:11:00,300 --> 02:11:06,900
But l'm not going to let that happen!
Not as long as l live! Never

1175
02:11:07,500 --> 02:11:13,700
What happened Mamma? Why are you
so worried? Whom are you talking of?

1176
02:11:15,300 --> 02:11:21,600
The one you love like a sister!
- Shalu...?

1177
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:26,300
Yes Shalu! You don't know
what she's doing behind your back

1178
02:11:26,700 --> 02:11:33,000
She's just like her mother! Wanton!
- Like her mother? l don't get you

1179
02:11:33,400 --> 02:11:38,900
What are you saying? Why are you
talking like this about Shalu?

1180
02:11:39,300 --> 02:11:45,400
You want to know? l'll tell you
the truth about her

1181
02:12:10,100 --> 02:12:15,500
Sitting here on a lovely evening
when romance is in the air?

1182
02:12:15,900 --> 02:12:18,400
You should've gone
on a dinner date with Dev

1183
02:12:19,100 --> 02:12:23,100
''ln your place, l wouldn't leave
Dev alone for a minute''

1184
02:12:23,400 --> 02:12:28,200
l would've tagged along everywhere.
- Stop that banter

1185
02:12:29,800 --> 02:12:31,400
We know...

1186
02:12:35,400 --> 02:12:38,500
''Shalu, not today.
l'll call him some other day''

1187
02:12:42,600 --> 02:12:44,400
Something happened?

1188
02:12:45,400 --> 02:12:47,700
Why are you silent?
- Shalu we know...

1189
02:12:50,100 --> 02:12:54,400
''You're hiding something from me.
What's the matter, Di?''

1190
02:12:54,800 --> 02:12:56,900
Nothing Shalu

1191
02:13:00,500 --> 02:13:03,400
''Something happened, Mamma.
- Stop feigning''

1192
02:13:04,400 --> 02:13:08,000
Don't you dare call me Mamma.
l'm not your Mamma

1193
02:13:08,400 --> 02:13:13,600
''No Nimmi! Let her know who she is,
what's the truth about her''

1194
02:13:14,300 --> 02:13:17,700
She must know the foul blood
that runs in her veins

1195
02:13:19,600 --> 02:13:23,200
''What's come over you? Why are you
being so harsh with me, Mamma?''

1196
02:13:23,500 --> 02:13:27,700
l told you l'm not your Mamma.
Why don't you understand that?

1197
02:13:28,200 --> 02:13:32,400
Your mother was the one
who poisoned my life and Nimmi's

1198
02:13:32,800 --> 02:13:36,400
Enough! Please calm down

1199
02:13:38,100 --> 02:13:46,100
''Come upstairs, Shalu. l'll explain.
- Stop Nimmi! l'm not through''

1200
02:13:48,300 --> 02:13:54,700
''Shalu, your father married me.
Nimmi is our daughter''

1201
02:13:56,300 --> 02:14:01,100
And your mother... l never knew
when they began living together

1202
02:14:02,500 --> 02:14:07,100
''lmagine the character,
the upbringing of a woman...''

1203
02:14:07,500 --> 02:14:13,000
who has an illicit relationship
with a married man

1204
02:14:13,500 --> 02:14:16,500
You are the illicit daughter
born of that illicit relationship

1205
02:14:17,500 --> 02:14:19,800
''Shalu, l'm with you''

1206
02:14:20,500 --> 02:14:24,100
''Whatever the truth,
we're still sisters''

1207
02:14:24,500 --> 02:14:32,800
''No Nimmi. For 20 years, l hid it
for the sake of my promise to Shekhar''

1208
02:14:33,500 --> 02:14:37,500
''l gave her my name, l reared her
like my daughter''

1209
02:14:38,200 --> 02:14:40,900
And l told the world
she is my daughter

1210
02:14:42,500 --> 02:14:49,900
l never married again because l didn't
want our past to mar your happinesses

1211
02:14:50,600 --> 02:14:57,100
''l gave her whatever l gave you.
What l did for you, l did for her''

1212
02:14:57,700 --> 02:15:04,500
But the very sight of her
would never let my wound heal

1213
02:15:05,500 --> 02:15:11,200
''Shalu, 20 years ago, your mother
robbed me of the joys of life''

1214
02:15:11,700 --> 02:15:15,900
''Today, will you do the same
to my daughter?''

1215
02:15:16,200 --> 02:15:21,700
''No...
- No Shalu, l'll never let you succeed''

1216
02:15:22,200 --> 02:15:23,200
Never

1217
02:15:24,300 --> 02:15:32,300
Done Mamma? Coughed up the venom of
20 years? Or is there any more left?

1218
02:15:34,500 --> 02:15:35,700
Come Shalu

1219
02:15:39,400 --> 02:15:43,700
''Shalu, tell me the truth! What were
you doing with Dev in his house?''

1220
02:15:44,400 --> 02:15:48,000
What is your relationship with Dev?
- Don't raise this topic

1221
02:15:48,300 --> 02:15:51,900
Why must l not? l will. Shut your ears
if you don't want to hear

1222
02:15:52,300 --> 02:15:54,300
But this will be decided today

1223
02:15:54,600 --> 02:15:57,100
Nimmi! Go to your room

1224
02:16:04,400 --> 02:16:10,600
''Shalu, what have l left undone for you?
Why have you done this to your sister?''

1225
02:16:11,400 --> 02:16:15,300
''The same sister who loves you,
always takes your cause...''

1226
02:16:15,700 --> 02:16:19,200
the sister who'd die for you!
Why did you do this Shalu?

1227
02:16:19,600 --> 02:16:24,300
''No Mamma! l can't imagine doing it!
l love Nimmi, she is everything for me''

1228
02:16:24,600 --> 02:16:26,600
Lies! White lies!

1229
02:16:27,300 --> 02:16:32,400
''Get this clear Shalu, no one's
stopping Dev from marrying Nimmi''

1230
02:16:32,800 --> 02:16:36,600
You will never succeed!
- You are getting me wrong Mamma

1231
02:16:39,700 --> 02:16:43,600
lt'll take you some time
to get over calling me Mamma

1232
02:16:44,300 --> 02:16:50,200
''But whether you want it or not, l am
your mother, until Dev married Nimmi''

1233
02:16:50,700 --> 02:16:54,900
''After that,
it's you and your destiny''

1234
02:17:07,900 --> 02:17:14,200
''Longing and suffering
in silence...''

1235
02:17:14,600 --> 02:17:20,600
make strange poetry

1236
02:17:27,600 --> 02:17:33,700
l try to feel...

1237
02:17:34,100 --> 02:17:40,200
every breath is painful

1238
02:17:40,700 --> 02:17:46,700
''l try to understand,
yet l know little...''

1239
02:17:47,200 --> 02:17:53,700
''the joys and sorrows
that's life''

1240
02:17:56,800 --> 02:18:03,100
''Sometimes it rains,
sometimes, it's autumn...''

1241
02:18:03,700 --> 02:18:09,800
''seasons come, seasons go''

1242
02:18:13,700 --> 02:18:21,700
''Through smiles and tears,
in joy, in sorrow, life is lived''

1243
02:19:03,800 --> 02:19:07,400
''Shalu, listen to me!
Whatever Mamma says...''

1244
02:19:07,800 --> 02:19:11,800
''whatever the world says,
you and l know how close we are''

1245
02:19:12,800 --> 02:19:17,000
''l'm your sister, l'll always be.
- Yes Di''

1246
02:19:19,800 --> 02:19:21,500
One more thing

1247
02:19:22,800 --> 02:19:29,100
Your Mamma and my Papa were nice.
They gave me this wonderful you

1248
02:19:30,400 --> 02:19:34,900
''l could never have a better sister.
You know that, don't you?''

1249
02:19:41,700 --> 02:19:44,600
Are you in love with Dev?
Tell me the truth

1250
02:19:44,900 --> 02:19:47,500
No Di... no...
- lf you love Dev...

1251
02:19:47,800 --> 02:19:50,800
''then Dev is yours,
everything l have is yours''

1252
02:19:51,500 --> 02:19:54,500
''For a sister like you,
l'd sacrifice a hundred Devs''

1253
02:19:54,900 --> 02:19:57,400
''No Di, you're mistaken.
- l always wanted you to be happy''

1254
02:19:58,600 --> 02:20:04,100
Say nothing more. Dev is yours.
- No Di...

1255
02:20:05,500 --> 02:20:13,000
''You know, you're the greatest sister
in the world''

1256
02:20:14,800 --> 02:20:16,700
You're also a fool

1257
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:21,500
How could l be in love with two guys?
- Two...?

1258
02:20:23,600 --> 02:20:26,300
''You know, ever since l was a kid...''

1259
02:20:30,800 --> 02:20:32,600
Sameer?

1260
02:20:35,800 --> 02:20:38,400
That's why you went
to see his shows at night?

1261
02:20:38,900 --> 02:20:41,100
You made me spend so much money

1262
02:20:44,900 --> 02:20:52,400
Then everything's fine.
l'll talk to Mamma. l promise

1263
02:20:53,800 --> 02:20:59,400
And then everything will be like always
... all of us will be happy

1264
02:21:01,900 --> 02:21:02,900
Yes Di

1265
02:21:11,900 --> 02:21:15,800
You think you're smart?
What you've been upto on the sly...

1266
02:21:17,900 --> 02:21:19,600
l know.
- What have l done?

1267
02:21:19,900 --> 02:21:21,900
''Whatever it is, he is to blame''

1268
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:25,400
And l never got to know?

1269
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:27,000
Sit

1270
02:21:27,700 --> 02:21:30,900
You turn out to be sly.
- Not l... him

1271
02:21:31,300 --> 02:21:34,800
You're caught out.
Shalu has told me everything

1272
02:21:35,100 --> 02:21:37,000
Shalu told you?
- What...?

1273
02:21:37,300 --> 02:21:39,200
''Quiet, you fool!
- Sure, you fool''

1274
02:21:41,900 --> 02:21:46,900
Shalu told you what?
- That you and Shalu are in love

1275
02:21:47,700 --> 02:21:50,200
Yes or no?
- Shalu said that?

1276
02:21:50,600 --> 02:21:52,400
''No, her ghost''

1277
02:21:53,700 --> 02:21:57,600
''Tell me, do you love her?''

1278
02:21:58,900 --> 02:21:59,900
Tell me

1279
02:22:00,700 --> 02:22:03,200
From the depths of my heart.
- Heart and soul

1280
02:22:03,500 --> 02:22:05,500
Ever since l was a kid.
- Every moment

1281
02:22:05,900 --> 02:22:08,600
Each and every moment.
- lt's only she

1282
02:22:08,900 --> 02:22:12,700
That l think of.
- Ever since you were a kid?

1283
02:22:13,100 --> 02:22:18,800
And Mamma and l haven't an inkling?
- Where is Shalu? She asked me to come

1284
02:22:19,200 --> 02:22:22,700
Urgent call from the office.
She had to leave. She left a message

1285
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:25,800
''Massage...!
- Not massage, message''

1286
02:22:26,100 --> 02:22:29,300
What message?
- She's going to see you tonight

1287
02:22:37,600 --> 02:22:41,400
How will l wait it out till tonight?
- There's no time! She's coming

1288
02:22:41,800 --> 02:22:46,500
''Yes, clean the house, get a snack...
- First of all, a ring you fool''

1289
02:22:50,700 --> 02:22:53,700
''Shalu, we must resolve
your mother's misconception''

1290
02:22:54,800 --> 02:22:57,300
Dad couldn't refuse her
when she spoke of Nimmi

1291
02:22:58,700 --> 02:23:06,500
And she thinks the wedding is final.
We must tell her the truth

1292
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:13,500
No Dev. l won't hurt Mamma or Di.
Try to understand me

1293
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:22,500
''You don't know, Di loves you dearly.
- Nimmi may be a nice girl''

1294
02:23:23,800 --> 02:23:27,200
''But l love you, not Nimmi.
- Then nothing can be done''

1295
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:36,000
l'm not forcing you to marry Nimmi.
But l can't hurt Mamma or Nimmi

1296
02:23:39,300 --> 02:23:44,400
And what about me?
What about my love for you?

1297
02:23:45,800 --> 02:23:51,600
ls it of no value? Only your mother
and Nimmi mean everything to you?

1298
02:23:53,800 --> 02:23:57,500
Have you no place
inside your heart for me?

1299
02:24:00,100 --> 02:24:06,600
Dev l can imagine what you're going
through. Do you think l don't feel?

1300
02:24:08,100 --> 02:24:15,100
But there's no other way! You don't
know what my sister means to me

1301
02:24:16,200 --> 02:24:22,900
''She loves you dearly. Yet, for my sake
she's willing to sacrifice her love''

1302
02:24:23,400 --> 02:24:30,900
Then why... what dilemma is this?
Why can't we say we're in love?

1303
02:24:31,300 --> 02:24:36,600
No Dev! lf Mamma gets to know
everything will be destroyed

1304
02:24:38,100 --> 02:24:42,700
''Our family is going to be ruined!
Please, for Mamma's sake, don't...''

1305
02:24:43,100 --> 02:24:50,100
Why not Shalu? She's your mother too.
Surely she loves you as much as Nimmi?

1306
02:24:51,100 --> 02:24:56,300
She will be just as happy.
What destruction are you afraid of?

1307
02:24:58,700 --> 02:25:04,400
She isn't my biological mother.
l'm her step daughter

1308
02:25:07,200 --> 02:25:11,600
''She has done much for me,
she has made many sacrifices''

1309
02:25:12,600 --> 02:25:18,400
She wants to see you and Nimmi married.
l can't deny her this happiness

1310
02:25:20,300 --> 02:25:23,700
''Please, understand my predicament''

1311
02:25:26,900 --> 02:25:30,500
''Sameer, Shalu is here.
- l'll be there in 2 minutes''

1312
02:25:34,200 --> 02:25:36,200
''Sit, Sameer is coming''

1313
02:25:50,900 --> 02:25:52,900
''Shalu, will you marry me?''

1314
02:26:00,200 --> 02:26:04,000
''Shalu, l'm your childhood sweetheart.
Will you marry me?''

1315
02:26:04,300 --> 02:26:08,300
''Hurry up, hero!
- One minute Rangeela''

1316
02:26:11,900 --> 02:26:16,900
''Sameer, l'm in trouble.
l need your help''

1317
02:26:17,900 --> 02:26:19,700
''Sure, l'll do anything for you''

1318
02:26:23,300 --> 02:26:31,900
''Sameer, l made a mistake.
l told my sister that we're in love''

1319
02:26:34,200 --> 02:26:36,200
''Sameer, are you listening?''

1320
02:26:39,200 --> 02:26:44,500
''Yes, l'm listening.
- Please, don't get me wrong''

1321
02:26:46,200 --> 02:26:52,900
''The situation was such, l had to lie.
- Lie...?''

1322
02:27:03,200 --> 02:27:09,800
l shouldn't have done that. But what
could l do? My sister loves him dearly

1323
02:27:10,400 --> 02:27:18,200
''And l want them to get married.
Sameer, will you help me?''

1324
02:27:19,900 --> 02:27:22,500
Will you feign
you're in love with me?

1325
02:27:25,400 --> 02:27:28,300
''Sameer, why are you silent?''

1326
02:27:29,400 --> 02:27:31,400
''Sameer, do you hear me?''

1327
02:27:32,400 --> 02:27:35,300
Why not? Of course l'll pretend
l'm in love with you

1328
02:27:36,100 --> 02:27:40,100
And even you won't be able
to make out it's an act

1329
02:27:41,400 --> 02:27:43,400
''One minute, hold this''

1330
02:27:44,300 --> 02:27:45,800
Give me your hand

1331
02:27:48,200 --> 02:27:52,900
''Shalu, will you marry me?
Tell me Shalu''

1332
02:27:53,300 --> 02:27:56,400
''Shalu, l'm your childhood sweetheart.
Will you marry me?''

1333
02:29:31,100 --> 02:29:35,900
''When l meet you,
l'll tell you...''

1334
02:29:36,400 --> 02:29:39,900
how dearly l love you

1335
02:29:40,400 --> 02:29:45,400
''When l meet you,
l'll tell you...''

1336
02:29:45,800 --> 02:29:49,000
how dearly l love you

1337
02:29:49,400 --> 02:29:52,400
My beloved

1338
02:29:56,500 --> 02:29:59,400
My beloved

1339
02:30:26,800 --> 02:30:33,200
''How will l survive those nights,
how will l survive those days...''

1340
02:30:34,400 --> 02:30:40,800
''how will l survive the loneliness
without you?''

1341
02:30:41,900 --> 02:30:48,300
''A painful solitude
suffuses me...''

1342
02:30:48,800 --> 02:30:55,300
''the days and nights
l think of you...''

1343
02:30:55,700 --> 02:30:58,500
my beloved

1344
02:31:33,200 --> 02:31:39,500
ln my eyes l will hold you

1345
02:31:40,500 --> 02:31:46,500
''ln my heart, l will hide you''

1346
02:31:47,800 --> 02:31:53,700
''Someday l'll tell you
what l'm going through''

1347
02:31:54,700 --> 02:32:01,200
''l'll tear out my heart
for you to see''

1348
02:32:01,500 --> 02:32:04,500
My beloved

1349
02:32:16,100 --> 02:32:20,600
''When l meet you,
l'll tell you...''

1350
02:32:21,700 --> 02:32:24,800
how dearly l love you

1351
02:33:10,800 --> 02:33:15,400
But why do you want to marry Nimmi?
Why do you want to ruin your life?

1352
02:33:15,700 --> 02:33:21,000
And you love Shalu so dearly!
Then why this suicide?

1353
02:33:23,400 --> 02:33:30,100
lt's my love that compels me

1354
02:33:32,700 --> 02:33:37,700
l can't tell you what l've been through
after Shalu refused to marry me

1355
02:33:39,500 --> 02:33:47,500
lt was too painful for me to bear
and l knew Shalu was hurting too

1356
02:33:48,700 --> 02:33:55,700
Shalu is doing this for
her mother's sake. ln her place...

1357
02:33:56,700 --> 02:34:01,500
maybe l'd do the same.
lf l don't marry Nimmi...

1358
02:34:01,900 --> 02:34:08,800
''Shalu will lose everything,
her home, her sister, her mother''

1359
02:34:12,500 --> 02:34:14,400
l'd never want that

1360
02:34:15,100 --> 02:34:18,800
''Mr Khanna, have the horoscopes matched?
Didn't l tell you?''

1361
02:34:19,600 --> 02:34:24,100
May congratulations to you too.
Shall we proceed with the formalities?

1362
02:34:30,900 --> 02:34:34,800
''Nimmi, tell us,
what does Dev look like?''

1363
02:34:36,800 --> 02:34:39,100
He's cross-eyed

1364
02:34:40,800 --> 02:34:42,100
He's bald

1365
02:34:42,500 --> 02:34:44,500
And he walks with a stick

1366
02:34:45,800 --> 02:34:51,100
''He tells me, ''Nimmi my love,
want to go to the cinema?''

1367
02:34:52,900 --> 02:34:59,300
ls he really like that?
- You'll stare wide-eyed when you see

1368
02:35:07,600 --> 02:35:10,500
''Congratulations Mr Mittal, one of
your dreams is about to come true''

1369
02:35:10,800 --> 02:35:13,500
All his dreams will come true
and all our dreams too

1370
02:35:13,800 --> 02:35:16,500
When did you break out of jail?
- Mr Khanna bailed me out...

1371
02:35:16,800 --> 02:35:20,800
for the wedding. He's magnanimous!
- Mr Dilani from Delhi

1372
02:35:22,600 --> 02:35:28,400
''Yes, have you any news?
Really? Very good''

1373
02:35:29,600 --> 02:35:31,600
Fax me the birth certificate

1374
02:35:32,800 --> 02:35:35,900
Now she is trapped

1375
02:35:38,600 --> 02:35:41,800
Ms Sarita will have to step down
from the Mayor's seat

1376
02:35:42,200 --> 02:35:46,000
''Else, the wedding is over''

1377
02:35:47,900 --> 02:35:53,500
Does your daughter work all day?
- Her name is Shalu

1378
02:35:53,900 --> 02:35:57,900
''Lovely name. Come, sit with us
for a while''

1379
02:35:58,900 --> 02:36:02,900
''Tomorrow, you will be bringing
Dev over for the engagement''

1380
02:36:03,600 --> 02:36:07,600
l hope the bridegroom doesn't fall
for so pretty a sister-in-law

1381
02:36:09,100 --> 02:36:13,000
''No, she won't be able to go.
There's much to do here''

1382
02:36:13,600 --> 02:36:16,600
Mr Mittal is here.
Says it's important

1383
02:36:23,600 --> 02:36:25,100
l'll be back

1384
02:36:25,400 --> 02:36:27,600
Two daughters and a wedding

1385
02:36:28,300 --> 02:36:30,400
Greetings.
- What are you doing here?

1386
02:36:30,900 --> 02:36:34,400
l thought l'd seize the opportunity
to meet you

1387
02:36:34,900 --> 02:36:36,400
l'll be back

1388
02:36:39,900 --> 02:36:45,900
l wanted to know who Renu Verma is...
- l don't know any Renu Verma

1389
02:36:48,500 --> 02:36:55,000
Renu Verma was related to your husband.
- Let's go upstairs and talk

1390
02:37:28,700 --> 02:37:34,000
''No matter how much you try to hide,
but the filthy truth outs, no?''

1391
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:41,300
Your husband Shekhar had an illicit
relationship with Renu Verma. Not true?

1392
02:37:41,700 --> 02:37:48,700
What nonsense! Get out of here!
- Raise your voice to your detriment

1393
02:37:50,400 --> 02:37:55,600
''lf the guests hear, you will lose face.
- Will you leave, or won't you?''

1394
02:37:56,000 --> 02:38:03,000
''Ms Sarita, Shalu is your husband's
illicit child. ls it not true?''

1395
02:38:03,300 --> 02:38:10,000
Now no lies. Here's Shalu's
birth certificate

1396
02:38:10,700 --> 02:38:14,600
lt mentions her mother's name clearly.
Which is Renu Verma

1397
02:38:15,000 --> 02:38:18,900
What's written in a birth certificate
makes no difference to me

1398
02:38:19,300 --> 02:38:24,300
''lf it makes no difference,
why have you concealed it?''

1399
02:38:24,800 --> 02:38:28,600
Why give the impression
that she is your daughter?

1400
02:38:29,000 --> 02:38:34,800
Who are you to ask?
l will not do what you wish

1401
02:38:35,700 --> 02:38:42,000
''Do not be hasty, and think it over.
Do you want this wedding called off?''

1402
02:38:45,200 --> 02:38:50,700
Would you have your daughter suffer
for the sake of an illegitimate?

1403
02:38:52,300 --> 02:38:54,300
How is Nimmi to blame?

1404
02:38:56,700 --> 02:38:59,400
Would you rather that Nimmi remains
a maid for life?

1405
02:39:06,700 --> 02:39:10,400
''Whatever you say, l will not allow
this city to be ruined''

1406
02:39:11,100 --> 02:39:14,900
''For God's sake, leave me
and my daughter alone''

1407
02:39:17,800 --> 02:39:22,400
How can l let you be?
l too want to become Mayor

1408
02:39:26,200 --> 02:39:28,200
Here's the stepdaughter

1409
02:39:29,100 --> 02:39:32,100
ls this a confrontation?
- You think you will scare us...

1410
02:39:32,400 --> 02:39:34,700
with your empty threats?
You cannot hurt us

1411
02:39:35,100 --> 02:39:38,700
Shalu go away. l do not
need your help

1412
02:39:39,100 --> 02:39:43,300
''Mamma please, this man...
- What's this Mamma-Mamma?''

1413
02:39:43,600 --> 02:39:48,100
''She isn't your mother. Look, here's
your original birth certificate''

1414
02:39:49,800 --> 02:39:51,800
No piece of paper
can change my mother

1415
02:39:54,300 --> 02:39:56,800
She is my real Mamma.
That's what she stays

1416
02:39:57,100 --> 02:40:02,100
''Shalu, you aren't my daughter, you can
never be. And if l suffer this day...''

1417
02:40:02,400 --> 02:40:06,400
it's because of you! They're
threatening to stop Nimmi's wedding

1418
02:40:06,800 --> 02:40:11,700
No Mamma! Nimmi will surely marry.
- But how Ms Shalu?

1419
02:40:12,100 --> 02:40:17,500
Dev might be modern. But will
Mr Khanna wish to be related...

1420
02:40:17,800 --> 02:40:23,100
to a family that is harbouring
an illegitimate child?

1421
02:40:24,600 --> 02:40:29,800
''Ms Sarita, think for yourself.
lf this wedding is called off...''

1422
02:40:30,100 --> 02:40:33,800
what standing are you left with?
- This wedding is happening

1423
02:40:34,100 --> 02:40:36,100
l'll tell Mr Khanna everything

1424
02:40:38,100 --> 02:40:43,100
Shalu! Stop! You tell him?
So that he can call off this wedding?

1425
02:40:44,200 --> 02:40:46,200
Just try

1426
02:40:48,500 --> 02:40:50,800
Shalu! Stop

1427
02:40:52,200 --> 02:40:55,500
''Stop l say...
listen to me, Shalu''

1428
02:40:56,000 --> 02:40:57,700
''Ms Sarita, what happened?''

1429
02:41:07,200 --> 02:41:09,200
Tell the driver to get the car

1430
02:42:31,000 --> 02:42:32,900
''Shalu, what happened?''

1431
02:42:39,000 --> 02:42:40,900
Say something

1432
02:42:48,000 --> 02:42:51,000
Shalu is here. She looks worried.
Something's amiss

1433
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:05,400
She looks tense
and she's saying nothing

1434
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:26,800
''Uncle, l'd like...''

1435
02:43:28,900 --> 02:43:30,300
l'd like...

1436
02:43:37,400 --> 02:43:42,500
''Uncle l...
- Yes, my child?''

1437
02:43:55,500 --> 02:43:57,000
Speak

1438
02:43:58,500 --> 02:44:00,300
''Tell me, my child''

1439
02:44:06,400 --> 02:44:09,300
''Uncle, what's wrong with me?''

1440
02:44:12,400 --> 02:44:14,700
Why is everyone worried
because of me?

1441
02:44:16,400 --> 02:44:18,400
''Why, particularly, my Mamma?''

1442
02:44:24,400 --> 02:44:26,400
She isn't my Mamma

1443
02:44:28,400 --> 02:44:35,500
lt was a saving grace
that she lent me her name

1444
02:44:37,200 --> 02:44:41,400
''l love her dearly,
but she isn't my Mamma''

1445
02:44:42,400 --> 02:44:46,400
My parents died 20 years ago
in an accident

1446
02:44:49,400 --> 02:44:58,500
''Tell me, if l am her stepdaughter
is it Mamma's fault?''

1447
02:45:03,100 --> 02:45:08,100
After knowing that Nimmi and l
are step sisters...

1448
02:45:10,100 --> 02:45:18,800
will you call off this wedding?
Am l so wretched...

1449
02:45:20,200 --> 02:45:24,800
that you will refuse to have
any relationship with my family?

1450
02:45:27,400 --> 02:45:35,400
Am l so evil that my Mamma and my Di
must suffer for my existence?

1451
02:45:43,200 --> 02:45:44,600
Uncle please...

1452
02:45:48,500 --> 02:45:50,500
She loves me so dearly

1453
02:45:52,400 --> 02:45:56,900
ls she the child l have despised
all my life?

1454
02:45:59,200 --> 02:46:02,500
How is she to blame
for whatever happened?

1455
02:46:03,500 --> 02:46:10,500
She loves me and Nimmi so dearly?
l don't care what Mr Khanna decides

1456
02:46:11,100 --> 02:46:15,500
l just want to hold
this loving daughter to my bosom

1457
02:46:39,500 --> 02:46:41,000
''Bless you, child''

1458
02:46:42,500 --> 02:46:50,000
''For a stepdaughter like you,
l'd give up a thousand of my offsprings''

1459
02:46:51,700 --> 02:46:57,900
''Have no worry,
this wedding will surely happen''

1460
02:47:05,200 --> 02:47:07,200
But l must commend your courage

1461
02:47:08,200 --> 02:47:12,600
''Before so many people, you spoke
the truth about yourself?''

1462
02:47:16,300 --> 02:47:17,300
Be happy

1463
02:47:28,600 --> 02:47:36,400
l never knew my father.
But l think he must've been like you

1464
02:47:56,700 --> 02:48:02,200
''lf you consider me to be like
a father, will you answer a question?''

1465
02:48:04,600 --> 02:48:10,900
Honestly... have you never loved Dev?

1466
02:48:28,400 --> 02:48:32,400
No. Only Nimmi loves Dev

1467
02:48:52,100 --> 02:48:54,800
l want to give Mamma the good news
right away

1468
02:49:17,700 --> 02:49:19,200
Wonderful...

1469
02:49:20,400 --> 02:49:24,300
such a selfless sacrifice

1470
02:49:39,700 --> 02:49:41,700
Your mother is back

1471
02:49:45,700 --> 02:49:47,900
Where is Shalu?
- Upstairs

1472
02:49:51,700 --> 02:49:53,400
''Sarita, where have you been?''

1473
02:49:53,700 --> 02:49:55,200
Give me a reply

1474
02:50:02,700 --> 02:50:07,000
Mamma! l spoke to Uncle Khanna!
He won't call off the wedding

1475
02:50:09,500 --> 02:50:12,700
''l know, l heard everything''

1476
02:50:15,700 --> 02:50:20,300
''Forgive me Shalu, l always
thought ill of you''

1477
02:50:21,700 --> 02:50:26,100
''You're my daughter, aren't you?
My own, aren't you?''

1478
02:50:26,700 --> 02:50:28,900
''My baby, forgive me''

1479
02:50:32,700 --> 02:50:36,100
''Mamma, for the first time ever
you embraced me''

1480
02:50:36,800 --> 02:50:38,800
Don't let go of me so soon

1481
02:50:44,500 --> 02:50:48,800
''My baby! l will always hold you
in my arms, forever''

1482
02:50:52,200 --> 02:50:58,800
Your mother must've been a great woman
to have borne a daughter like you

1483
02:50:59,900 --> 02:51:05,900
''Believe me Shalu, l never knew
that you and Dev were in love''

1484
02:51:06,800 --> 02:51:10,800
You needn't make
such a great sacrifice

1485
02:51:11,500 --> 02:51:13,800
''l'll talk to Nimmi, it'll all be fine.
- No...''

1486
02:51:15,600 --> 02:51:19,600
''She's ready for the wedding,
tomorrow's the engagement''

1487
02:51:20,200 --> 02:51:27,400
''She will have a heartbreak.
Di has her Dev, l have my mother''

1488
02:51:28,500 --> 02:51:30,200
l want nothing more

1489
02:51:42,700 --> 02:51:44,000
Look

1490
02:52:55,500 --> 02:53:00,900
''l've given you my heart,
l am in love with you''

1491
02:53:07,500 --> 02:53:12,900
''l've stolen your heart,
because you said yes''

1492
02:54:01,700 --> 02:54:07,000
''My beloved, my sweetheart,
l dance to your tune''

1493
02:54:07,700 --> 02:54:12,000
''Hush, someone might hear''

1494
02:54:13,700 --> 02:54:18,700
''l have loved you,
l didn't rob you''

1495
02:54:19,100 --> 02:54:24,100
l didn't force you

1496
02:54:27,300 --> 02:54:33,000
''l've made you restless,
because l make you pine''

1497
02:54:39,000 --> 02:54:44,700
''l've given you my heart,
l am in love with you''

1498
02:55:30,700 --> 02:55:35,500
Never in midstream...

1499
02:55:36,000 --> 02:55:38,600
leave me...

1500
02:55:39,000 --> 02:55:41,600
never break my heart

1501
02:55:42,100 --> 02:55:47,600
''How can l tell you
how l suffer?''

1502
02:55:48,100 --> 02:55:53,100
''lf l live for you,
l'll die for you''

1503
02:55:56,100 --> 02:56:01,900
''l have found you now,
after waiting so long for you''

1504
02:56:08,100 --> 02:56:13,600
''l've given you my heart,
l love you''

1505
02:56:37,800 --> 02:56:40,500
What is the matter?
Why are you so sad?

1506
02:56:40,800 --> 02:56:44,100
''lt's nothing, Nimmi.
- Surely it's something''

1507
02:56:45,100 --> 02:56:51,700
''You're hiding something from me.
- You see, the truth always outs''

1508
02:56:52,200 --> 02:56:58,800
''What truth is Rangeela speaking of?
- Nimmi, whatever is happening is wrong''

1509
02:57:26,200 --> 02:57:34,800
''Nimmi, l didn't mean to hurt you.
- No, you saved me from doing...''

1510
02:57:35,200 --> 02:57:43,300
what l'd never forgive myself for.
Shalu did all this for my happiness?

1511
02:57:45,100 --> 02:57:48,400
Does she not understand?

1512
02:57:49,900 --> 02:57:57,200
''lf she and Dev love each other,
how can l be happy with Dev?''

1513
02:58:17,200 --> 02:58:24,500
Not everyone is destined to find love.
- But loving is everyone's lot...

1514
02:58:27,000 --> 02:58:35,400
''no matter if it remains a dream.
- As long as the dream was, it was fine''

1515
02:58:37,000 --> 02:58:43,200
''lf it's no more, then so be it.
- That's life''

1516
02:58:52,000 --> 02:58:57,800
''Sameer, we've both been in love.
But we're still to do our duty''

1517
02:58:58,200 --> 02:59:02,200
''You're right, not all is over''

1518
02:59:28,100 --> 02:59:35,300
''To make this launch memorable,
l'll share some news with you''

1519
02:59:36,400 --> 02:59:41,400
My son Dev is marrying
Ms Sarita's daughter

1520
02:59:52,000 --> 02:59:55,000
What are you doing?
He's talking about you and Dev

1521
02:59:55,300 --> 03:00:00,300
''Shalu, how did you and Mamma imagine
that l'd be happy if you are unhappy?''

1522
03:00:01,100 --> 03:00:10,100
Silly. Dev loves you. Only you.
Then how can l marry him?

1523
03:00:11,100 --> 03:00:16,500
''Luckily Sameer told me everything. Or,
l'd never be able to forgive myself''

1524
03:00:18,300 --> 03:00:23,600
You're a darling and you deserve
all the happiness in the world

1525
03:00:52,500 --> 03:00:54,500
''You did the right thing, Nimmi''
