1
00:03:00,376 --> 00:03:01,786
Where were you?

2
00:03:03,251 --> 00:03:04,331
Move it.

3
00:03:04,667 --> 00:03:05,957
Your reels.

4
00:03:07,292 --> 00:03:09,382
The crowd is dying to see this.

5
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:24,419
Let's roll.

6
00:04:54,292 --> 00:04:56,212
Good condition, these girls.

7
00:05:00,251 --> 00:05:02,041
Hear that?

8
00:05:06,376 --> 00:05:09,666
They're wanking away in there.
Here.

9
00:05:16,376 --> 00:05:18,036
How's Heera?

10
00:05:19,126 --> 00:05:20,036
He's good.

11
00:05:20,459 --> 00:05:22,789
I've never seen you before.

12
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:28,246
Selling reels for the first time?

13
00:07:12,084 --> 00:07:16,964
<i>I wondered again
how the hell it all started.</i>

14
00:07:21,834 --> 00:07:24,424
<i>Maybe when
I peddled those reels in Ajmer.</i>

15
00:07:26,376 --> 00:07:28,576
<i>I shouldn't have done that.</i>

16
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:41,751
Duggal.

17
00:07:43,417 --> 00:07:46,417
<i>We should have stuck to making films.</i>

18
00:07:48,417 --> 00:07:52,207
<i>It was stupid
to try and sell them ourselves.</i>

19
00:09:23,584 --> 00:09:27,384
You stripped in front of a goddamn crowd
in Madras, now what?

20
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:30,167
That's why I said
no husbands on set.

21
00:09:30,459 --> 00:09:34,419
Hey! You don't get it?
Need me to spell it out?

22
00:10:10,792 --> 00:10:12,382
Now look who's here.

23
00:10:12,667 --> 00:10:15,577
Sonu, this is Nadia.
Our new heroine.

24
00:10:16,376 --> 00:10:18,576
How about making me a drink?
- What about me?

25
00:10:19,001 --> 00:10:20,421
Mummy ji.

26
00:10:21,834 --> 00:10:23,504
We need ice.

27
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,789
I've got to talk to you.

28
00:10:29,751 --> 00:10:31,131
Ten minutes.

29
00:10:35,834 --> 00:10:38,214
I shouldn't have gone to Ajmer.

30
00:10:39,459 --> 00:10:41,499
You gave Heera your word.

31
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:44,579
What word?

32
00:10:46,417 --> 00:10:49,497
From now on, we work for ourselves.

33
00:10:51,084 --> 00:10:52,504
Your share.

34
00:10:53,417 --> 00:10:54,917
Take it.

35
00:10:58,667 --> 00:10:59,997
Go on.

36
00:11:00,667 --> 00:11:02,077
And Poonam's share?

37
00:11:02,417 --> 00:11:04,167
Poonam's share?

38
00:11:05,334 --> 00:11:07,714
She owes me money!

39
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,039
Poonam's share!

40
00:11:13,209 --> 00:11:14,709
Yeah, spit it out.

41
00:11:17,292 --> 00:11:18,752
When?

42
00:11:26,584 --> 00:11:28,674
I told you, I knew it.

43
00:11:29,126 --> 00:11:30,956
Heera phoned Poonam.

44
00:11:31,292 --> 00:11:33,672
I told you he'd find out.
- You cunt.

45
00:11:34,042 --> 00:11:36,172
What the fuck did you do in Ajmer?

46
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,999
I told you to be discreet...
- I was.

47
00:11:41,334 --> 00:11:45,464
... and not attract attention.
Did you carry a sign with my name on it?

48
00:11:47,792 --> 00:11:50,002
You can't do one tiny little job?

49
00:11:50,417 --> 00:11:51,707
Goddamn moron!

50
00:11:54,334 --> 00:11:55,544
Fucking idiot!

51
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:16,539
What the hell should I do now?
- Go ahead, kill each other.

52
00:12:16,917 --> 00:12:19,497
I keep slaving away like an asshole.
- Enough, Vicky.

53
00:12:21,292 --> 00:12:23,292
We're living like dogs.

54
00:12:23,584 --> 00:12:26,134
I'm sick of slogging for nothing.

55
00:12:34,584 --> 00:12:36,634
We're going nowhere.

56
00:12:38,292 --> 00:12:40,332
I'm fed up of you both.

57
00:12:43,709 --> 00:12:45,789
Always at each other's throats.

58
00:13:19,417 --> 00:13:20,497
Hey, Sonu.

59
00:13:22,834 --> 00:13:24,134
Sonu?

60
00:13:26,917 --> 00:13:28,247
You okay?

61
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,579
I'm finished.
I can't do this anymore.

62
00:13:33,376 --> 00:13:35,996
You're always such a baby.

63
00:13:37,667 --> 00:13:39,497
All brothers fight.

64
00:13:39,917 --> 00:13:40,997
So what?

65
00:13:44,626 --> 00:13:48,246
It's never going to be easy
for people like us.

66
00:13:48,542 --> 00:13:49,752
I don't care.

67
00:13:50,126 --> 00:13:53,416
About what?
- About anything, I'm leaving.

68
00:13:56,626 --> 00:13:58,576
I don't need him.

69
00:14:00,917 --> 00:14:03,917
Where will you go?
- Can't I do anything else?

70
00:14:09,084 --> 00:14:10,714
Feeling ambitious, eh?

71
00:14:14,292 --> 00:14:16,082
Cutting us off?

72
00:14:16,417 --> 00:14:18,827
Who pimped those reels in Ajmer?

73
00:14:19,209 --> 00:14:21,039
Forgot about us, eh?

74
00:14:26,209 --> 00:14:30,079
Thought we wouldn't find out?

75
00:14:31,751 --> 00:14:34,831
Learn your place, thief.
Got it, Duggal?

76
00:14:38,417 --> 00:14:40,167
You produce.

77
00:14:41,001 --> 00:14:42,631
I distribute. That's the rule.

78
00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:46,629
I'm a thief.
- Get that into your stupid head.

79
00:14:52,459 --> 00:14:55,629
We've worked together for ten years, idiot.

80
00:14:56,417 --> 00:15:01,037
"Birth of a Baby" was your debut, right?
Mr. Heera, sir, here's all your money.

81
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:04,707
So you're a big shot now.

82
00:15:19,751 --> 00:15:23,631
Go to that ladies hostel.
- Where the nurses stay.

83
00:15:24,459 --> 00:15:26,129
What do you say, boss?

84
00:15:27,251 --> 00:15:29,251
We need some cash.

85
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:31,879
If you want some chicks...

86
00:15:32,292 --> 00:15:33,882
I'm sick.

87
00:15:35,042 --> 00:15:38,922
Jolly, what kind of director are you?
- C'mon, where do I get a bird from?

88
00:15:41,209 --> 00:15:42,959
What do you want me to do?

89
00:15:45,251 --> 00:15:48,421
Use your fucking brains.
Grab a whore. Anyone.

90
00:15:50,126 --> 00:15:52,706
Sonu, he's your brother...
- So what?

91
00:15:53,084 --> 00:15:55,464
It's his job.
- I won't do it.

92
00:15:55,792 --> 00:15:59,252
You're the fucking director. It's your job.
- Don't piss me off!

93
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,579
Fuck you.
- Watch yourself, big man.

94
00:16:03,292 --> 00:16:05,132
It's your job, asshole.

95
00:16:06,292 --> 00:16:08,922
Who do you think you are?

96
00:16:09,251 --> 00:16:11,331
I'm no pimp, understand?
- Shut up!

97
00:16:12,501 --> 00:16:13,541
Fuck off!

98
00:16:13,959 --> 00:16:15,169
Careful.

99
00:16:16,667 --> 00:16:19,497
Don't get up my ass.
-That's enough!

100
00:16:19,834 --> 00:16:22,044
What the fuck is going on here?

101
00:16:22,376 --> 00:16:26,166
Tell that dog to shut up. He's...
- Shut your face, Sonu!

102
00:16:26,459 --> 00:16:29,539
Want a whack?
- He insulted me first.

103
00:16:37,167 --> 00:16:39,997
Who's Sonu? Suraj sent me.

104
00:16:43,167 --> 00:16:45,287
I got a 500 rupee advance.

105
00:16:45,709 --> 00:16:50,249
I come to work and this is what I get...
- Wait, Sonu. What are you doing?

106
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:52,582
Why don't you understand?

107
00:16:53,542 --> 00:16:55,422
Wait, listen to me.

108
00:16:57,084 --> 00:17:00,544
<i>Vicky has been like this
ever since we were kids.</i>

109
00:17:02,167 --> 00:17:04,537
<i>He was always trying.</i>

110
00:17:05,584 --> 00:17:10,294
Sex-starved girls
forced into a world of sin.

111
00:17:11,917 --> 00:17:15,127
“Beauty Parlour”, Duggal Brothers.

112
00:17:16,042 --> 00:17:18,502
Two hours, two thousand thrills.

113
00:17:19,334 --> 00:17:21,794
The joys of the bedroom,
right there in the cinema.

114
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:24,377
<i>He wanted friends
he couldn't match up to.</i>

115
00:17:24,667 --> 00:17:26,497
Damn liar.

116
00:17:27,167 --> 00:17:29,827
This asshole never keeps his word.

117
00:17:30,751 --> 00:17:33,711
C'mon, I'll make all of you happy.

118
00:17:34,084 --> 00:17:37,134
My clients here
will finance Vicky's film. Ok?

119
00:17:38,792 --> 00:17:39,632
Sir...

120
00:17:40,001 --> 00:17:42,251
<i>That's how he met PK.</i>

121
00:17:42,959 --> 00:17:44,499
Vicky.

122
00:17:52,417 --> 00:17:53,497
Yes, sir.

123
00:17:53,834 --> 00:17:56,044
<i>He made a goddamn mess</i>

124
00:17:56,709 --> 00:17:58,709
<i>and I was left to clean up.</i>

125
00:18:00,417 --> 00:18:04,247
Honestly, my clients
don't much care for your films, Vicky.

126
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:08,826
They just want to see quivering flesh.

127
00:18:10,209 --> 00:18:11,959
The girls need to be pretty.

128
00:18:12,626 --> 00:18:13,996
And shameless.

129
00:18:44,042 --> 00:18:46,422
Young girls are quite bold nowadays.

130
00:18:48,251 --> 00:18:50,541
Hello, screen test.

131
00:18:52,667 --> 00:18:54,327
Everyone.

132
00:18:54,626 --> 00:18:56,496
My brother, Sonu.

133
00:19:03,126 --> 00:19:06,076
Sonu, don't just stand there...

134
00:19:06,417 --> 00:19:08,497
Get Mr. Heera a refill.

135
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:13,751
PK sir?

136
00:19:20,251 --> 00:19:22,421
Look at him throwing attitude.

137
00:19:22,709 --> 00:19:25,129
Come on, get us drunk!

138
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:31,537
You're Vicky's little brother?
Why so unfriendly?

139
00:19:35,834 --> 00:19:38,544
Piss off.
- Which one of us do you like? Come clean!

140
00:19:39,584 --> 00:19:41,084
You fancy her?

141
00:19:46,417 --> 00:19:48,627
The poor guy is sweating.

142
00:19:49,126 --> 00:19:52,706
Nice shirt, stallion. Want to try mine?
- Take it off, then.

143
00:19:53,084 --> 00:19:55,924
If I take it off? You'll sit there
and do nothing? You're a girl?

144
00:19:56,292 --> 00:19:58,132
Shut up, bitch!

145
00:19:58,626 --> 00:20:00,166
Oh, what a temper!

146
00:20:12,542 --> 00:20:13,962
<i>It was always that way.</i>

147
00:20:15,584 --> 00:20:17,884
<i>You go wear yourself out daily.
you go on and on,</i>

148
00:20:18,292 --> 00:20:19,882
<i>but shouldn't you know
where you are going?</i>

149
00:20:38,292 --> 00:20:40,632
<i>You've got to have some standards.</i>

150
00:20:44,126 --> 00:20:46,126
<i>What's a man without them?</i>

151
00:21:12,209 --> 00:21:15,919
Shut up!
- Calm down! Be quiet.

152
00:21:16,292 --> 00:21:17,752
Just be quiet.

153
00:21:18,459 --> 00:21:19,539
Friends!

154
00:21:19,834 --> 00:21:23,134
Enjoy it, sell it, get rich.

155
00:21:24,626 --> 00:21:28,786
The first time in India! A thought-
provoking film about adult love!

156
00:21:29,167 --> 00:21:33,917
This is just the beginning...
- Hey Heera, no speeches.

157
00:21:50,001 --> 00:21:52,881
Nadia, say hello to Mr. Heera.

158
00:21:55,167 --> 00:21:57,577
He's a very rich man.

159
00:21:58,167 --> 00:22:01,577
He wants us to make special pictures
with you.

160
00:22:02,501 --> 00:22:05,921
You like her, sir?
She has potential?

161
00:22:07,376 --> 00:22:10,996
She does.
- Oh, she'll do anything you ask.

162
00:22:12,417 --> 00:22:14,497
Oh really?
A sign of good parenting, eh?

163
00:22:17,876 --> 00:22:19,456
Bitch!

164
00:22:19,751 --> 00:22:22,171
I scrimped and saved to raise her.

165
00:22:24,334 --> 00:22:25,924
Ungrateful...

166
00:22:26,292 --> 00:22:27,922
whore!

167
00:22:38,167 --> 00:22:39,917
What did I tell you?

168
00:22:41,167 --> 00:22:43,577
I said I'd make you all happy, didn't I?

169
00:22:44,542 --> 00:22:45,752
Careful!

170
00:23:57,376 --> 00:24:00,786
Pump it up!
- What a lame party!

171
00:24:26,501 --> 00:24:27,501
Sonu?

172
00:25:01,459 --> 00:25:02,789
Why the long face?

173
00:25:03,834 --> 00:25:05,504
Move, Jolly.

174
00:25:07,376 --> 00:25:08,956
What's wrong?

175
00:25:09,334 --> 00:25:12,004
Why are we doing this?
What's this party about?

176
00:25:12,376 --> 00:25:15,126
These people are not for us.
They're different.

177
00:25:15,459 --> 00:25:19,209
What's different?
You think I'm stupid?

178
00:25:21,292 --> 00:25:23,922
Vicky, you're digging your own grave,
you know that?

179
00:25:24,292 --> 00:25:28,132
You think I'm fucking thick, is that it?
- Don't make a scene.

180
00:25:30,209 --> 00:25:32,629
Listen. Look...

181
00:25:34,251 --> 00:25:36,131
It's our first crack...

182
00:25:36,459 --> 00:25:39,129
Our first crack at real dough.

183
00:25:40,126 --> 00:25:41,576
Listen.

184
00:25:42,459 --> 00:25:45,289
Look at the backing we got.
We're in good hands.

185
00:25:46,834 --> 00:25:49,004
C'mon. It's only you and me, Sonu.

186
00:25:49,376 --> 00:25:50,956
Okay?

187
00:25:51,792 --> 00:25:54,252
Cheer up. Smile.

188
00:26:05,876 --> 00:26:07,746
Get out of here.

189
00:26:08,126 --> 00:26:10,786
Dirty whore. Go back to your gutter.

190
00:26:11,292 --> 00:26:13,002
Poonam, get a grip!
- Get out!

191
00:26:16,126 --> 00:26:18,166
You old hag.

192
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:28,876
Stop it!

193
00:26:31,001 --> 00:26:33,501
Stop it, girls!

194
00:26:35,126 --> 00:26:36,916
That's enough.

195
00:26:39,917 --> 00:26:41,667
Poonam!

196
00:26:43,542 --> 00:26:45,792
Poonam, stop it!

197
00:27:31,209 --> 00:27:33,209
Amazing talent!
You can come, now bugger off.

198
00:27:33,542 --> 00:27:36,132
Maqsood, come in your suit tomorrow.

199
00:27:36,459 --> 00:27:39,039
Bhavesh, you too.

200
00:27:40,167 --> 00:27:41,917
Bhandare, come here.

201
00:27:42,334 --> 00:27:45,254
Okay, you'll get it.
I don't have time!

202
00:27:45,917 --> 00:27:47,747
What the hell do I do?

203
00:27:50,501 --> 00:27:52,921
Pappu, back to work.
- I can't work with Vicky.

204
00:28:06,167 --> 00:28:07,417
Tell me.

205
00:28:07,834 --> 00:28:09,384
I need a job.

206
00:28:09,667 --> 00:28:13,877
Then get a job.

207
00:28:14,292 --> 00:28:16,212
Don't insult me man.

208
00:28:19,917 --> 00:28:21,207
All right, then.

209
00:28:21,792 --> 00:28:23,832
Want to be a manager?

210
00:28:28,167 --> 00:28:30,877
Okay, forget it.
How about an engineer?

211
00:28:33,626 --> 00:28:36,956
The whole world's making romantic films,
why shouldn't I?

212
00:28:38,376 --> 00:28:40,666
I see. Romantic.

213
00:28:41,209 --> 00:28:44,789
Save it. Your brother runs things,
the money comes in.

214
00:28:45,459 --> 00:28:47,959
How many times do I have to explain this?

215
00:28:48,459 --> 00:28:50,129
Excuse me, sir...

216
00:28:56,376 --> 00:28:57,786
Look at me.

217
00:28:58,167 --> 00:28:59,787
I'm really busy.

218
00:29:03,417 --> 00:29:05,167
Tell me something?

219
00:29:05,876 --> 00:29:08,956
Is that cotton
or do you have oranges up there?

220
00:29:10,542 --> 00:29:12,132
You can't be shy here.

221
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:14,249
Keep an open mind.

222
00:29:16,876 --> 00:29:19,416
I'm very good at sexy dance.

223
00:29:36,709 --> 00:29:37,959
Come over here.

224
00:30:09,709 --> 00:30:10,959
Tiku?

225
00:30:12,959 --> 00:30:14,919
Who are those girls?

226
00:30:15,292 --> 00:30:18,292
What's up?
Haven't had any hokey-pokey for a while?

227
00:30:29,542 --> 00:30:31,672
Who'll play the queen? Tell me?

228
00:30:33,917 --> 00:30:36,827
You can sleep with whomever you want.
But on my set...

229
00:30:37,251 --> 00:30:39,461
Shut up and sit down.
- I'm the only one...

230
00:30:39,876 --> 00:30:41,996
You should all be in jail.

231
00:30:43,709 --> 00:30:47,879
Acting like a big shot.
Whose money are you spending?

232
00:30:48,251 --> 00:30:50,001
Whose car are you driving?
- You're crazy, bitch.

233
00:30:50,376 --> 00:30:51,876
You're all criminals.

234
00:30:52,251 --> 00:30:54,171
Vicky!
- Let go of me, asshole.

235
00:30:54,501 --> 00:30:55,421
Vicky!

236
00:30:55,709 --> 00:30:59,039
You can't bring me down.
- Want to hit me, asshole?

237
00:30:59,417 --> 00:31:01,417
I'll hit right back.

238
00:31:01,709 --> 00:31:03,879
Get out of here. Drunk slut.

239
00:31:04,251 --> 00:31:05,581
Stop it!

240
00:31:07,501 --> 00:31:08,791
Get the hell out.
- Poonam.

241
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:10,627
No more films with you.

242
00:31:11,084 --> 00:31:12,424
Damn whore.

243
00:31:12,709 --> 00:31:14,499
Poonam! Wait.

244
00:31:29,126 --> 00:31:32,126
Sonu, I'm warning you! You leave and...
- Don't threaten me.

245
00:31:32,542 --> 00:31:35,292
What's this bullshit?
- Go back to your work. Poonam!

246
00:31:35,626 --> 00:31:36,706
Listen.

247
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:00,544
The thing is,

248
00:32:00,959 --> 00:32:02,999
the queen's costume is ruined.

249
00:32:04,626 --> 00:32:06,746
So what do I wear?

250
00:32:10,126 --> 00:32:12,376
Can I at least wear the crown?

251
00:32:14,001 --> 00:32:15,791
You're the queen...

252
00:32:16,751 --> 00:32:21,001
Who else wears the crown?

253
00:32:30,626 --> 00:32:34,036
Everybody out!
Except the cameraman and Jolly.

254
00:32:35,876 --> 00:32:38,326
You'll stay, no?
- Sure.

255
00:32:39,167 --> 00:32:41,127
We're right here.

256
00:32:43,459 --> 00:32:45,039
Roll it!

257
00:33:18,417 --> 00:33:20,167
Are you sad?

258
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:24,919
Come on then.

259
00:33:28,042 --> 00:33:30,252
Come on.

260
00:33:32,626 --> 00:33:34,036
Let's have some fun.

261
00:33:34,834 --> 00:33:36,884
People are staring.

262
00:33:37,251 --> 00:33:39,291
No one is staring.

263
00:33:49,709 --> 00:33:51,289
Hey, Poonam.

264
00:34:51,626 --> 00:34:53,206
Excuse me?

265
00:34:53,542 --> 00:34:54,962
You...

266
00:34:57,667 --> 00:34:59,667
Ram Kishan Production?

267
00:35:01,626 --> 00:35:04,376
You...
- You work in films?

268
00:35:06,334 --> 00:35:07,714
I'm a director.

269
00:35:29,126 --> 00:35:31,286
Come and see me.

270
00:35:32,584 --> 00:35:34,254
For a screen test.

271
00:35:35,834 --> 00:35:38,884
The thing is,
my uncle doesn't like all this.

272
00:35:39,876 --> 00:35:43,246
If he finds out,
it'll become a little difficult.

273
00:35:44,376 --> 00:35:45,876
But once you're a star,

274
00:35:46,709 --> 00:35:48,999
no one will have any problem.

275
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:51,626
I'm right, aren't I?
- Maybe.

276
00:35:51,959 --> 00:35:54,579
You have a phone number?
- I've got to go.

277
00:36:25,167 --> 00:36:26,787
I'm going.

278
00:36:27,959 --> 00:36:29,499
Vicky.

279
00:36:31,626 --> 00:36:33,416
Poonam.

280
00:36:45,417 --> 00:36:46,747
Don't go.

281
00:37:30,251 --> 00:37:31,961
Your money.

282
00:37:37,792 --> 00:37:39,832
We are even.

283
00:39:27,626 --> 00:39:29,576
You didn't forget me?

284
00:39:33,209 --> 00:39:37,169
Tiku told me all about you.
I hear you're really connected.

285
00:39:37,459 --> 00:39:40,039
No, I'm just searching
for a new heroine, so...

286
00:39:40,334 --> 00:39:42,334
You're humble.

287
00:39:44,001 --> 00:39:47,791
You're making a film with Kumar Gaurav?
- No, I'm thinking about it.

288
00:39:53,376 --> 00:39:55,456
Why?
- I don't really want to work with him.

289
00:40:02,334 --> 00:40:04,294
So, what's the name of your film?

290
00:40:05,251 --> 00:40:08,631
Well, it's titled... Miss Lovely.

291
00:40:09,751 --> 00:40:12,711
A love story. Romantic.

292
00:40:16,209 --> 00:40:18,209
Pinky.
- Pinky.

293
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:23,579
If my uncle picks up,
don't answer.

294
00:41:34,209 --> 00:41:36,709
100,000 rupees per reel.

295
00:41:37,501 --> 00:41:40,581
Reasonable, no?
- Vicky, want me to smash your skull?

296
00:41:40,917 --> 00:41:44,417
Don't bother with him.
We deal with PK. Call him.

297
00:41:44,792 --> 00:41:46,882
Vicky!
- Leave him and get PK on the phone.

298
00:41:49,834 --> 00:41:54,084
He said let go of me.
- Drop it. Get PK on the phone.

299
00:41:54,376 --> 00:41:57,206
Yes, call him.
- I won't haggle with this beggar.

300
00:41:57,542 --> 00:41:59,502
Go ahead, call PK.

301
00:41:59,876 --> 00:42:02,666
Sir, this price was set by him, not me.

302
00:42:03,001 --> 00:42:06,001
What?
- He's buying up all your suppliers.

303
00:42:27,084 --> 00:42:29,544
All right! Everybody out.

304
00:42:30,334 --> 00:42:31,714
Pappu.

305
00:42:32,126 --> 00:42:36,956
Throw everyone out.
C'mon, get out.

306
00:42:37,959 --> 00:42:40,999
Out, everybody!
And you piss off as well.

307
00:42:49,334 --> 00:42:51,294
So where's the dough from?

308
00:42:55,209 --> 00:42:56,999
Tell me.

309
00:42:58,126 --> 00:43:01,746
You need a scriptwriter?
- You'll help me, right?

310
00:43:04,709 --> 00:43:06,669
So, how much more can you offer?

311
00:43:09,626 --> 00:43:14,286
Find another fifty grand, I'll fix it.
Something romantic, right? Superb.

312
00:43:18,126 --> 00:43:21,376
Why so worried? C'mon, shake my hand.

313
00:43:22,542 --> 00:43:25,792
All right, great. Let's party.

314
00:43:26,126 --> 00:43:29,456
You sure you'll help?
- You need a scriptwriter, right?

315
00:43:34,834 --> 00:43:36,384
Don't be nervous.

316
00:43:40,876 --> 00:43:45,286
C'mon, drink up.
You're in good hands. You understand?

317
00:43:51,834 --> 00:43:54,754
<i>Say something, Deepak.
There has to be a way.</i>

318
00:43:59,334 --> 00:44:00,964
<i>There is only one way.</i>

319
00:44:35,126 --> 00:44:36,076
<i>You're here?</i>

320
00:44:39,792 --> 00:44:41,132
<i>I always knew</i>

321
00:44:42,876 --> 00:44:44,666
<i>you would come.</i>

322
00:44:46,751 --> 00:44:48,251
<i>Mili...</i>

323
00:44:49,001 --> 00:44:51,631
<i>I've brought you flowers!</i>

324
00:44:55,042 --> 00:44:59,672
I can't tell you how much
the producers loved your photos.

325
00:45:01,626 --> 00:45:05,916
They could call you any day now:
"Pinky, where are you?"

326
00:45:09,209 --> 00:45:10,829
I don't believe you.

327
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:14,462
Only you can be "Miss Lovely".

328
00:45:18,917 --> 00:45:22,707
I'll tell you something?
Shooting starts in a month.

329
00:45:23,042 --> 00:45:24,962
You must take the signing amount.

330
00:45:26,417 --> 00:45:28,917
But I don't even know how to act.

331
00:45:29,334 --> 00:45:30,754
Anyone can act.

332
00:45:31,084 --> 00:45:34,754
You've got to have strong eyes,
a nice-looking face, which you have...

333
00:45:35,667 --> 00:45:38,877
They need a fresh face... you are...
- I should go.

334
00:45:39,167 --> 00:45:40,827
I'll drop you.
- No.

335
00:45:41,126 --> 00:45:43,706
I'll get a taxi and drop...
- I said no.

336
00:45:52,001 --> 00:45:54,831
The neighbours will see you and talk.

337
00:46:33,209 --> 00:46:35,129
Wait a moment, sir.

338
00:46:53,126 --> 00:46:54,326
Just...

339
00:47:37,667 --> 00:47:40,627
Sir, what are you trying to say?
I look like a thief?

340
00:47:40,959 --> 00:47:42,419
Keep your voice down.

341
00:47:46,792 --> 00:47:48,502
What would you like?

342
00:47:51,292 --> 00:47:53,132
That we start an enquiry?

343
00:47:53,459 --> 00:47:56,629
Maybe I should call your family...
- No, don't, sir. Please.

344
00:48:08,667 --> 00:48:10,457
If you'd like...

345
00:48:11,709 --> 00:48:13,419
I could help you.

346
00:48:14,417 --> 00:48:18,247
Give me two minutes.
Just two minutes. I'll be back.

347
00:48:55,167 --> 00:48:57,377
I've got the advance.

348
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:24,382
<i>How do I explain what she was like?</i>

349
00:49:31,959 --> 00:49:34,129
<i>I don't know what it was about her.</i>

350
00:49:36,751 --> 00:49:39,881
<i>But she was like me.
We were the same.</i>

351
00:50:09,751 --> 00:50:13,171
<i>I just felt I could do anything
in the world for her.</i>

352
00:50:17,459 --> 00:50:20,459
<i>Because I knew
she'd do anything in the world for me.</i>

353
00:52:19,626 --> 00:52:21,456
How are you liking it?

354
00:52:23,126 --> 00:52:24,786
Special, isn't it?

355
00:52:28,084 --> 00:52:29,924
Just relax, ok?

356
00:52:40,542 --> 00:52:42,252
I'll go get us something.

357
00:52:48,876 --> 00:52:51,416
Aren't you going to introduce me
to your friend?

358
00:52:52,417 --> 00:52:54,827
Pinky, my brother, Vicky.
- Pinky.

359
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:58,789
What a striking name.

360
00:53:00,251 --> 00:53:02,331
Remember, I told you.

361
00:53:04,292 --> 00:53:06,632
Ajmer, on the train...

362
00:53:07,792 --> 00:53:09,632
Where were you?

363
00:53:10,292 --> 00:53:12,172
I was looking for you.

364
00:53:13,209 --> 00:53:16,629
But you've got better things to do.

365
00:53:19,042 --> 00:53:22,292
C'mon fucker, we need you.

366
00:53:37,417 --> 00:53:40,707
We'll go somewhere else.
Listen. One minute.

367
00:53:41,042 --> 00:53:44,792
I can't do this.
- But what's the matter. C'mon?

368
00:53:45,751 --> 00:53:48,081
Tell me, what's the matter?

369
00:53:53,167 --> 00:53:55,207
Listen to me. What's wrong?

370
00:53:55,709 --> 00:53:56,999
Look.

371
00:53:57,292 --> 00:53:59,422
You lied to me from the start.

372
00:54:00,876 --> 00:54:02,916
What kind of heroine
are you going to make me?

373
00:54:03,709 --> 00:54:05,959
You can't even take care of yourself.

374
00:54:16,334 --> 00:54:17,424
Pinky.

375
00:54:21,751 --> 00:54:23,461
At least listen to me.

376
00:54:26,501 --> 00:54:28,131
Please don't go, Pinky.

377
00:54:51,126 --> 00:54:53,206
What?
- It's your wedding night.

378
00:54:53,542 --> 00:54:56,422
Got it.
- Your husband's impotent.

379
00:54:56,876 --> 00:55:00,206
Would it kill you
to get a few more flowers?

380
00:55:01,292 --> 00:55:04,252
Might make the damn room
smell a little nicer.

381
00:55:10,501 --> 00:55:12,751
Give me a hot shot.

382
00:55:13,084 --> 00:55:14,634
You'll be famous.

383
00:55:34,709 --> 00:55:38,079
It's a real pleasure
to work with people like you.

384
00:55:41,126 --> 00:55:44,456
Any thought on your next film?

385
00:55:47,084 --> 00:55:49,294
Let's try something fresh...

386
00:55:54,042 --> 00:55:55,922
School girls...

387
00:55:57,084 --> 00:56:00,754
who crave something new from life.

388
00:56:25,834 --> 00:56:29,134
Hey!
Tell him that I need to speak to him.

389
00:56:39,126 --> 00:56:40,416
Hey!

390
00:56:40,792 --> 00:56:43,082
He doesn't want to be disturbed.

391
00:56:52,459 --> 00:56:54,879
Vicky... - Where were you?
Get us tea, quick.

392
00:56:55,167 --> 00:56:58,167
Remember Pinky, the girl I was with...
- Not now.

393
00:56:58,501 --> 00:56:59,711
Listen.

394
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:07,077
Pinky?

395
00:59:08,251 --> 00:59:10,461
You here?
- You live here?

396
00:59:22,084 --> 00:59:23,884
Why did you do this to me?

397
00:59:24,834 --> 00:59:27,504
I'm sorry, Pinky, for everything.
I didn't mean to...

398
00:59:28,376 --> 00:59:30,036
I didn't know...

399
00:59:31,251 --> 00:59:32,831
What happened?

400
00:59:34,001 --> 00:59:36,041
Why are you crying, Pinky?

401
00:59:38,001 --> 00:59:39,381
He saw me with you.

402
00:59:44,334 --> 00:59:45,834
Your uncle?

403
00:59:46,626 --> 00:59:48,496
Did he hurt you?

404
00:59:50,959 --> 00:59:52,789
You stay here with me, ok?

405
00:59:53,084 --> 00:59:56,084
It's okay, everything will be fine.

406
00:59:59,001 --> 01:00:02,921
I want to show you something.
Close your eyes.

407
01:00:03,209 --> 01:00:04,289
Just for a minute.

408
01:00:05,292 --> 01:00:06,792
C'mon, please, close your eyes.

409
01:00:07,459 --> 01:00:08,999
Don't open them, ok?

410
01:00:30,959 --> 01:00:33,419
I'm only going to make this film
with you.

411
01:00:42,001 --> 01:00:43,381
I'll do anything for you.

412
01:00:43,751 --> 01:00:46,711
Only you matter. What difference
does it make if you or I have the money?

413
01:00:47,042 --> 01:00:49,712
Sonu, I can't take all this.
- No, you'll have to.

414
01:00:53,667 --> 01:00:55,667
I paid Ravi Nagaich an advance.

415
01:00:57,084 --> 01:00:59,294
The guy who wrote "Love Story '85".

416
01:01:00,167 --> 01:01:03,827
Pinky, it's all happening.
It's all ready, it's coming together.

417
01:01:10,084 --> 01:01:11,924
You're going to be a star one day.

418
01:02:35,792 --> 01:02:38,632
Making designs on your brother's girl?

419
01:02:38,959 --> 01:02:40,629
How terrible.

420
01:02:41,501 --> 01:02:44,381
I don't know if I can restrain myself.

421
01:02:46,626 --> 01:02:48,126
At least try.

422
01:03:53,167 --> 01:03:55,077
Sonika.
- Pinky!

423
01:04:22,376 --> 01:04:23,576
Pinky.

424
01:04:27,834 --> 01:04:29,174
Get off me!

425
01:04:31,792 --> 01:04:33,382
I love Sonu.

426
01:04:34,209 --> 01:04:36,829
Oh, the innocence!

427
01:04:39,959 --> 01:04:41,709
All right, then.

428
01:04:43,209 --> 01:04:44,919
Tell him everything.

429
01:04:47,084 --> 01:04:48,464
Tell him.

430
01:04:52,459 --> 01:04:54,629
Lay it out for him, my Sonika.

431
01:04:57,334 --> 01:05:00,754
I didn't know he was your brother.
- Listen.

432
01:05:02,084 --> 01:05:05,004
Sonu can't wash away your sins.

433
01:05:08,376 --> 01:05:10,666
I've tried so hard to find you.

434
01:05:13,209 --> 01:05:15,079
You are special...

435
01:06:20,501 --> 01:06:23,291
That whore Nadia's
going to ruin everything.

436
01:06:25,501 --> 01:06:28,381
Who knew she'd run away like this?
Sir, make something up.

437
01:06:28,834 --> 01:06:30,384
I'm not answering.

438
01:06:31,959 --> 01:06:33,829
PK's going crazy, he wants his reels.

439
01:06:40,209 --> 01:06:41,829
I'll ask him for an extension.

440
01:06:42,126 --> 01:06:44,956
We'll organize girls by tomorrow.

441
01:06:45,959 --> 01:06:49,959
I was just wondering, without Nadia...
I mean, the boys need their money.

442
01:06:50,376 --> 01:06:53,126
We'll call girls, sir, we'll get some.
- We'll call them, we'll call them.

443
01:06:53,459 --> 01:06:55,919
Get Kimmi.
- But she works for Heera now.

444
01:06:56,334 --> 01:06:59,424
We can't keep avoiding him.
PK wants the reels now.

445
01:06:59,834 --> 01:07:01,884
The phone's ringing.
- We haven't shot shit.

446
01:07:02,167 --> 01:07:03,667
Calm down.
- Sir, the phone...

447
01:07:04,001 --> 01:07:06,081
I can hear the phone ringing, ok?

448
01:07:15,459 --> 01:07:17,499
Answer it, sir.

449
01:07:17,876 --> 01:07:20,416
It's better you talk to him.

450
01:07:21,376 --> 01:07:25,496
He'll assume we sold
the schoolgirl reels to someone else.

451
01:07:26,584 --> 01:07:29,044
PK isn't going to take this lightly.
- Vicky?

452
01:07:29,334 --> 01:07:31,044
What a fucked up day.

453
01:07:31,459 --> 01:07:33,829
Did you say something to Pinky
at that party? - Not now, I'm dealing...

454
01:07:34,126 --> 01:07:35,916
You have to tell me.

455
01:07:36,209 --> 01:07:41,209
Vicky, you didn't do anything to her,
did you? - I told you.

456
01:07:41,667 --> 01:07:45,287
She's not for you. Forget her.
- Forget her? What do you mean?

457
01:07:45,667 --> 01:07:47,417
Have you gone mad?

458
01:07:47,792 --> 01:07:51,962
You have to...
- What are you doing? Get off me.

459
01:07:53,459 --> 01:07:55,289
Feel like a big man?

460
01:07:58,042 --> 01:08:01,172
You must have done something to her.

461
01:08:02,167 --> 01:08:06,127
Where is she? I know you.

462
01:08:06,459 --> 01:08:08,829
Let go of me.
- You have to tell me.

463
01:08:09,126 --> 01:08:12,416
Where?

464
01:08:12,792 --> 01:08:14,502
Get off me, asshole.

465
01:08:51,001 --> 01:08:55,421
Did your father teach you that?
- Arrest the motherfuckers.

466
01:08:58,876 --> 01:09:02,496
Bastard. Getting girls to strip?

467
01:09:04,167 --> 01:09:08,287
Come here, asshole! - Shooting a rape
scene? Turn off the damn camera!

468
01:09:41,084 --> 01:09:43,834
<i>Many come here to struggle.</i>

469
01:09:45,626 --> 01:09:49,496
STRUGGLING ACTRESS FOUND MUTILATED

470
01:09:49,876 --> 01:09:52,876
<i>If you come to struggle
you've got to have some idea.</i>

471
01:09:53,167 --> 01:09:55,827
<i>You know, who to work with... where.</i>

472
01:09:59,084 --> 01:10:02,584
What say, bitch?
Think you're some star?

473
01:10:05,292 --> 01:10:09,082
You love getting naked
for the camera? - No.

474
01:10:10,501 --> 01:10:14,791
I did it for love. - Let's go to the
station, I'll strip you of everything.

475
01:10:17,251 --> 01:10:19,501
Spit it out.
We need numbers and addresses.

476
01:10:20,751 --> 01:10:22,961
Who is your pimp?

477
01:10:29,334 --> 01:10:31,674
Who else is involved in this?

478
01:10:32,001 --> 01:10:33,791
Who else?

479
01:10:41,834 --> 01:10:43,294
Rane, are you seeing this?

480
01:10:46,459 --> 01:10:49,289
Tell Patare to search thoroughly.

481
01:10:49,959 --> 01:10:52,289
Nothing should be left behind, got it?

482
01:10:53,209 --> 01:10:55,459
Patare! What?

483
01:11:03,084 --> 01:11:06,634
<i>The accused had filmed her
performing sexual acts.</i>

484
01:11:07,667 --> 01:11:12,127
<i>More than one dozen people
have been questioned or arrested.</i>

485
01:11:13,417 --> 01:11:14,997
<i>To identify the main accused,</i>

486
01:11:15,292 --> 01:11:18,882
<i>the authorities require
the assistance of the public.</i>

487
01:11:19,792 --> 01:11:22,172
<i>Vicky Duggal, age 48,</i>

488
01:11:23,292 --> 01:11:25,422
<i>Sonu Duggal, age 40,</i>

489
01:11:26,417 --> 01:11:27,627
<i>Haribhai...</i>

490
01:12:35,542 --> 01:12:38,212
<i>The disease of pornography
must be eradicated</i>

491
01:12:38,584 --> 01:12:41,794
<i>for the further health
and purity of our society.</i>

492
01:12:42,126 --> 01:12:45,456
<i>These depraved individuals
show no respect</i>

493
01:12:45,792 --> 01:12:48,502
<i>to our Indian nation and institutions,</i>

494
01:12:48,834 --> 01:12:52,044
<i>inciting corrupt thoughts
and lustful desires.</i>

495
01:12:53,292 --> 01:12:56,462
<i>Anyone with information on the suspects
are asked to call</i>

496
01:12:58,042 --> 01:13:00,752
2-3-0-0-6-1.

497
01:13:42,584 --> 01:13:45,044
Where are the schoolgirls?

498
01:13:49,667 --> 01:13:52,247
Where are my reels, Vicky?

499
01:13:54,334 --> 01:13:58,254
You are embarrassing me
in front of my clients.

500
01:14:07,792 --> 01:14:10,292
You will have to find a way.

501
01:14:12,917 --> 01:14:14,167
Right?

502
01:15:40,459 --> 01:15:42,249
We have to do this, Sonu.

503
01:15:42,584 --> 01:15:46,254
If we let go of this chance,
we'll lose everything.

504
01:18:26,126 --> 01:18:30,036
I'll be back in an hour.
Mane's agreed to take the handout.

505
01:18:31,084 --> 01:18:34,754
Don't be scared. Boy fucks girl.
That's it. - Vicky, hang on.

506
01:18:35,251 --> 01:18:38,251
It's a blue film.
- There's nothing to be afraid of.

507
01:18:38,542 --> 01:18:40,332
It's not like shooting bits...

508
01:19:00,417 --> 01:19:03,037
Those metal cameras are done kid.
Look:

509
01:19:03,542 --> 01:19:05,542
Magnetic tape.

510
01:19:05,917 --> 01:19:07,917
This.
- Listen!

511
01:19:08,417 --> 01:19:11,747
Video recording.
- Hey! Get us a drink.

512
01:19:25,917 --> 01:19:27,497
You scumbag.

513
01:19:27,834 --> 01:19:30,634
Want me to smack you in jail?
- Mane Sahab.

514
01:19:31,001 --> 01:19:33,631
What good is it to have me in jail?

515
01:19:35,959 --> 01:19:39,169
There's a warrant out for you.
You'll get the shit kicked out of you...

516
01:19:39,501 --> 01:19:41,211
One minute.

517
01:19:41,542 --> 01:19:44,002
No more.
- Don't say that...

518
01:19:44,334 --> 01:19:47,004
I've done enough for you.
- Have some faith...

519
01:19:48,251 --> 01:19:51,461
This won't do...
- Look what I've got. - Not good enough.

520
01:19:51,917 --> 01:19:55,287
Mane Sahab, two weeks.
- No.

521
01:19:55,626 --> 01:19:58,626
Please.
Just give me two weeks.

522
01:19:59,459 --> 01:20:01,249
It's worse than you think.
- Sir, help me.

523
01:20:02,167 --> 01:20:05,247
Asshole, your brother
has swallowed up all your dough.

524
01:20:07,501 --> 01:20:09,251
I hear he's making a film.

525
01:20:09,542 --> 01:20:11,212
"Miss Lovely".

526
01:20:47,126 --> 01:20:48,376
Get down.

527
01:21:15,376 --> 01:21:17,206
Hey, stay here!

528
01:21:27,376 --> 01:21:29,036
He's not here.

529
01:21:29,376 --> 01:21:30,576
Are you mad?

530
01:21:52,292 --> 01:21:55,632
She used to stick to him
24 hours a day.

531
01:22:09,251 --> 01:22:10,631
Come on.

532
01:22:28,251 --> 01:22:29,541
Stop.

533
01:22:48,584 --> 01:22:50,384
Move it!

534
01:22:50,667 --> 01:22:52,417
Come on, inside.

535
01:25:25,709 --> 01:25:28,419
I need to call my brother.

536
01:25:33,417 --> 01:25:34,827
Look.

537
01:25:35,834 --> 01:25:39,464
Here's the thing. We want
your brother here just as much as you do.

538
01:25:39,792 --> 01:25:42,252
Vicky has become rather popular lately.

539
01:25:45,917 --> 01:25:47,417
Huh?

540
01:25:49,167 --> 01:25:51,417
You don't seem to understand, son.

541
01:25:53,167 --> 01:25:55,577
You've been educated in this since
childhood, eh?

542
01:26:00,417 --> 01:26:02,917
He's going to make her a star...

543
01:26:03,542 --> 01:26:04,672
So, what is it?

544
01:26:06,292 --> 01:26:09,382
You have no respect
for our mothers and sisters?

545
01:26:11,459 --> 01:26:13,669
Forgot our Indian traditions?

546
01:26:17,751 --> 01:26:19,501
Should we remind you?

547
01:26:21,417 --> 01:26:22,917
Bastard.

548
01:26:23,251 --> 01:26:24,581
Sick pervert.

549
01:26:32,084 --> 01:26:35,214
What the hell is this?
Get out of the way.

550
01:26:35,501 --> 01:26:37,921
Stop it! Stop fighting.

551
01:26:40,251 --> 01:26:41,751
Hello?

552
01:26:45,792 --> 01:26:49,132
Yes, this is Vicky Duggal's wife.

553
01:30:38,167 --> 01:30:40,497
<i>The worst had already happened.</i>

554
01:30:41,667 --> 01:30:43,577
<i>Nothing else could happen now.</i>

555
01:30:47,834 --> 01:30:50,384
<i>And soon things began to seem
quite fine again.</i>

556
01:32:25,751 --> 01:32:27,001
Sonu.

557
01:32:44,167 --> 01:32:45,747
No I don't want to go.
- Sign it.

558
01:32:46,084 --> 01:32:48,214
I like it here.

559
01:32:51,001 --> 01:32:54,961
Go on, sign it.
- I don't want to leave.

560
01:32:56,292 --> 01:32:57,792
This... I...

561
01:32:58,459 --> 01:33:02,419
I won't go anywhere else.
I like it here. I won't go.

562
01:34:04,001 --> 01:34:06,171
Yes, of course it's possible.

563
01:34:06,542 --> 01:34:08,712
Hello? Yes, Poonam here.

564
01:34:11,876 --> 01:34:13,746
I'll call you later.

565
01:34:27,334 --> 01:34:29,294
When did you get out?

566
01:34:37,792 --> 01:34:39,082
Look, Sonu.

567
01:34:39,459 --> 01:34:43,329
I've left my past far behind.

568
01:34:51,126 --> 01:34:53,126
This is my guru.

569
01:34:55,792 --> 01:34:58,582
He gave me my respect and honour back.

570
01:35:00,167 --> 01:35:03,627
In a split second
he transformed my life.

571
01:35:09,709 --> 01:35:11,459
How are you?

572
01:35:13,834 --> 01:35:15,384
Good.

573
01:35:16,417 --> 01:35:18,667
Will you do me a favour?

574
01:35:24,792 --> 01:35:26,712
Promise me
you won't come back here again.

575
01:37:23,459 --> 01:37:25,419
You never came back for me?

576
01:37:26,792 --> 01:37:29,712
And you stole from me.

577
01:37:30,292 --> 01:37:32,792
Do you know what I went through?

578
01:37:33,834 --> 01:37:35,504
How hard it was?

579
01:37:39,584 --> 01:37:41,544
Anyway, Sonu.

580
01:37:42,542 --> 01:37:44,292
It's all...

581
01:37:45,001 --> 01:37:47,381
It's all her doing.

582
01:37:49,001 --> 01:37:49,831
Isn't it?

583
01:37:50,542 --> 01:37:52,502
She duped you.

584
01:37:56,084 --> 01:37:57,584
Pinky?

585
01:38:01,542 --> 01:38:03,832
Kid, I told you from the start.

586
01:38:07,459 --> 01:38:09,499
She'll never change.

587
01:38:13,209 --> 01:38:14,999
Where is it? Just a second.

588
01:38:34,709 --> 01:38:35,919
Look.

589
01:38:44,001 --> 01:38:46,881
<i>Does your boyfriend know about this?</i>

590
01:38:54,459 --> 01:38:56,539
<i>And why are you here?</i>

591
01:39:03,084 --> 01:39:04,884
Always been an actress.

592
01:39:10,459 --> 01:39:14,039
<i>How many times a week
do you have sex, Pooja?</i>

593
01:39:19,834 --> 01:39:23,214
Remember Joshi, that music composer?

594
01:39:24,751 --> 01:39:26,671
The bitch married him.

595
01:39:29,792 --> 01:39:33,462
She saw her chance

596
01:39:35,167 --> 01:39:36,827
and latched right on.

597
01:39:40,501 --> 01:39:43,081
<i>Can I get a little peek, Pooja?</i>

598
01:39:44,084 --> 01:39:46,834
<i>Show us the other one as well. Touch it.</i>

599
01:39:50,834 --> 01:39:54,464
<i>Would you like me to touch it?
- Yes.</i>

600
01:39:57,376 --> 01:40:01,376
I told you all along: all those promises

601
01:40:01,709 --> 01:40:04,669
and caresses don't count for much.

602
01:40:08,042 --> 01:40:09,462
Yes, tell me.

603
01:40:12,542 --> 01:40:13,792
No, no.

604
01:40:18,167 --> 01:40:19,077
No.

605
01:40:19,751 --> 01:40:21,291
Not today, man.

606
01:42:35,917 --> 01:42:39,747
<i>All I remember is this, my love</i>

607
01:42:44,126 --> 01:42:48,916
<i>We'll be together till eternity</i>

608
01:43:07,959 --> 01:43:11,789
<i>From the time I first saw you</i>

609
01:43:12,126 --> 01:43:15,786
<i>I don't know what has come over me</i>

610
01:43:16,876 --> 01:43:20,456
<i>I think one thing and say another</i>

611
01:43:20,792 --> 01:43:24,172
<i>I have drunk the potion of love</i>

612
01:43:24,542 --> 01:43:28,542
<i>What kind of ecstasy is this?</i>

613
01:43:28,834 --> 01:43:32,384
<i>I have forgotten the whole world</i>

614
01:43:32,709 --> 01:43:35,829
<i>All I remember is you</i>

615
01:43:36,834 --> 01:43:38,964
<i>My love</i>

616
01:44:24,876 --> 01:44:26,706
<i>That was exactly how it was.</i>

617
01:44:29,959 --> 01:44:32,579
<i>At last, two love-hungry souls united.</i>

618
01:44:33,876 --> 01:44:37,496
<i>And after everything, you know,
I finally found my heart's desire.</i>
