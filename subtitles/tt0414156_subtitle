01:50:07,049 --> 01:50:08,546
He hung the call as soon as he heard me.

1408
01:50:17,832 --> 01:50:18,877
Mr. Barua, here!

1409
01:50:19,343 --> 01:50:21,401
Give me commissioner of police.

1410
01:50:23,572 --> 01:50:24,445
Thank you, sir!

1411
01:50:24,816 --> 01:50:26,800
I didn't knew the address
of 'Jwalamukhi Mandal'.

1412
01:50:27,356 --> 01:50:28,504
I will go right away
and search that place.

1413
01:50:33,257 --> 01:50:34,146
Mahabali.

1414
01:50:34,206 --> 01:50:35,243
She has a misconception.

1415
01:50:35,761 --> 01:50:39,182
Actually, I escaped from
the lock-up so that you all...

1416
01:50:40,123 --> 01:50:42,522
Lock him along with dad
and daughter at a place...

1417
01:50:42,966 --> 01:50:44,878
...where the police can arrest the trio.

1418
01:50:47,091 --> 01:50:50,172
Mahabali, it's a nice move but...

1419
01:50:54,468 --> 01:50:55,401
Now...

1420
01:50:56,334 --> 01:50:58,356
You thought that you have bluffed me.

1421
01:50:59,067 --> 01:51:01,111
You brought me here by
luring about the microfilm.

1422
01:51:01,762 --> 01:51:03,206
Sorry, sister!

1423
01:51:03,347 --> 01:51:04,976
I know the whereabouts of microfilm.

1424
01:51:07,903 --> 01:51:08,888
Stop!

1425
01:51:09,273 --> 01:51:11,324
We need that microfilm!

1426
01:51:13,961 --> 01:51:15,538
We needed that microfilm.

1427
01:51:15,835 --> 01:51:16,930
You will get it right away, Mahabali.

1428
01:51:17,411 --> 01:51:19,166
We need it, Mahabali.

1429
01:51:19,707 --> 01:51:22,781
Sankat is missing.
No one knows if he is alive or dead.

1430
01:51:23,455 --> 01:51:24,676
You. Come here!

1431
01:51:30,719 --> 01:51:31,467
Tell me.

1432
01:51:31,860 --> 01:51:33,290
How much money will you take?

1433
01:51:34,673 --> 01:51:35,969
Rs. 100000?

1434
01:51:37,696 --> 01:51:38,666
Rs. 200000?

1435
01:51:39,236 --> 01:51:40,540
Rs. 500000 or Rs. 1000000?

1436
01:51:41,325 --> 01:51:42,057
Stop!

1437
01:51:42,635 --> 01:51:44,049
This man is a fraud!

1438
01:51:44,294 --> 01:51:45,479
Absolutely a fraud!

1439
01:51:45,731 --> 01:51:47,048
I have microfilm with me.

1440
01:51:47,493 --> 01:51:48,648
Check this out!

1441
01:51:48,952 --> 01:51:52,989
Now give the entire gold,
names of members and photographs to me!

1442
01:51:53,402 --> 01:51:56,076
Now I am,
Mahabali and here is the microfilm.

1443
01:52:00,867 --> 01:52:01,430
It's fake.

1444
01:52:02,246 --> 01:52:04,037
If you don't believe me
then you may ask Tara.

1445
01:52:04,741 --> 01:52:06,244
She has the real microfilm.

1446
01:52:08,962 --> 01:52:09,814
Check this out.

1447
01:52:15,650 --> 01:52:16,797
Jugal Maharaj!

1448
01:52:17,397 --> 01:52:19,952
Bichhoo, who killed my daughter, Saloni!

1449
01:52:20,115 --> 01:52:21,515
He is the one!

1450
01:52:25,394 --> 01:52:26,564
Tell me, you, evil!

1451
01:52:27,684 --> 01:52:28,462
[GUNSHOT]

1452
01:52:51,974 --> 01:52:54,084
Throw away the revolver
and give me the microfilm.

1453
01:52:55,720 --> 01:52:57,749
Throw it away!

1454
01:53:07,829 --> 01:53:08,939
Police!

1455
01:53:42,928 --> 01:53:43,965
Jugal Maharaj?

1456
01:54:00,517 --> 01:54:01,242
[HUMS]

1457
01:54:02,924 --> 01:54:04,553
Tara Kapoor and her mom.

1458
01:54:06,456 --> 01:54:07,471
Traitor!

1459
01:54:08,323 --> 01:54:10,033
You know well about microfilm, don't you?

1460
01:54:11,358 --> 01:54:12,551
Did Jugal Maharaj brought it?

1461
01:54:13,240 --> 01:54:14,580
Microfilm has been burned.

1462
01:54:14,810 --> 01:54:16,261
Really? Who burned it?

1463
01:54:16,987 --> 01:54:18,104
The Mahabali of 'Jwalamukhi'.

1464
01:54:18,801 --> 01:54:19,949
He burned it in the fire of 'Jwalamukhi'.

1465
01:54:20,978 --> 01:54:22,505
The members of the party killed him.

1466
01:54:34,360 --> 01:54:35,419
Mr. Shola?

1467
01:54:37,048 --> 01:54:39,825
Mr. Brijnarayan Shola
threw away all these books.

1468
01:54:40,863 --> 01:54:42,343
He used to teach boys earlier.

1469
01:54:45,883 --> 01:54:47,046
So many books?

1470
01:54:49,046 --> 01:54:51,120
How did he turn into demon then?

1471
01:55:03,421 --> 01:55:04,856
Mr. Shola snatched the gold...

1472
01:55:05,501 --> 01:55:07,123
...stolen in the train...

1473
01:55:07,842 --> 01:55:08,981
...from Solanki's goons...

1474
01:55:09,441 --> 01:55:10,521
...and hit it here.

1475
01:55:10,878 --> 01:55:11,729
[HUMS]

1476
01:55:11,900 --> 01:55:13,543
Mr. Shola must not
be directly involved in it.

1477
01:55:14,336 --> 01:55:17,202
No. In stead of bandits or goons...

1478
01:55:17,794 --> 01:55:19,557
...he used to get things done by the kids.

1479
01:55:33,791 --> 01:55:35,886
It contains the name and address of
the members of 'Jwalamukhi Mandal'.

1480
01:55:37,071 --> 01:55:39,078
Some names will shock you.

1481
01:55:40,396 --> 01:55:41,167
A lot.

1482
01:55:46,543 --> 01:55:47,698
No one would believe it either.

1483
01:55:50,112 --> 01:55:51,053
This list...

1484
01:55:51,564 --> 01:55:53,201
...contains the names of the
members of 'Jwalamukhi Mandal'.

1485
01:55:55,504 --> 01:55:56,585
I've spoke to home minister.

1486
01:55:57,466 --> 01:55:58,880
He is going to Delhi
in the evening flight.

1487
01:56:00,414 --> 01:56:01,028
Fine.

1488
01:56:04,886 --> 01:56:05,745
Bichhoo!

1489
01:56:09,522 --> 01:56:11,596
Mr. Shankar, no one is present here.

1490
01:56:12,064 --> 01:56:13,249
Really?

1491
01:56:14,019 --> 01:56:16,722
There used to be a lot of books here.

1492
01:56:16,856 --> 01:56:18,781
There is nothing out here now.
Everything is clean!

1493
01:56:19,226 --> 01:56:20,343
- Mr. Banne!
- Yes?

1494
01:56:20,818 --> 01:56:21,551
Listen.

1495
01:56:22,127 --> 01:56:22,817
Someone is coming this way.

1496
01:56:23,743 --> 01:56:26,075
Not one. I think many are coming.

1497
01:56:26,631 --> 01:56:28,178
Come along.

1498
01:56:28,712 --> 01:56:29,563
Come.

1499
01:56:41,657 --> 01:56:44,590
Where are we? No matter where
we are but it is not safe to stay here!

1500
01:56:44,953 --> 01:56:46,760
Police can come here anytime.

1501
01:56:51,790 --> 01:56:53,375
- Hello!
- Inspector.

1502
01:56:54,397 --> 01:56:57,286
Mr. Barua is leaving to
Delhi by train at 10.30 p.m.

1503
01:56:57,412 --> 01:56:58,833
- Oh!
- [HUNG UP THE CALL]

1504
01:56:59,196 --> 01:57:00,129
What did I just hear?

1505
01:57:00,640 --> 01:57:01,980
Number seven said that...

1506
01:57:02,403 --> 01:57:03,877
...by 10.30 p.m.'s train...

1507
01:57:04,196 --> 01:57:04,987
...Mr. Barua will...

1508
01:57:05,247 --> 01:57:07,839
...leave to Delhi along with
Home Minister with a secret file.

1509
01:57:08,483 --> 01:57:11,112
Boss, what can we do? Our names
have already reached to the police.

1510
01:57:11,289 --> 01:57:14,126
Yes. And we have no other
choice but to blow up the train.

1511
01:57:14,750 --> 01:57:17,193
- But who will blow up the train?
- Bichhoo is there to do that.

1512
01:57:18,141 --> 01:57:20,141
Around 11.30,
this train will reach Safedpur...

1513
01:57:20,740 --> 01:57:23,236
...passing through Davayya.

1514
01:57:24,576 --> 01:57:25,502
Next to it is a cabin.

1515
01:57:26,510 --> 01:57:29,042
We need to hijack it
and explode the cabin.

1516
01:57:31,183 --> 01:57:32,427
Things will happen exactly how you want.

1517
01:57:32,671 --> 01:57:34,352
Yes. Just remember one more thing.

1518
01:57:35,056 --> 01:57:37,107
Home minister's special compartment...

1519
01:57:37,477 --> 01:57:38,706
...is the last compartment of the train.

1520
01:57:39,900 --> 01:57:42,618
Train must explode when
that last compartment...

1521
01:57:43,766 --> 01:57:44,722
I understood everything.

1522
01:57:45,721 --> 01:57:47,980
- How much will I be paid?
- You be rest assured.

1523
01:57:48,698 --> 01:57:50,897
You will be paid Rs.
100000, once you are done with the task.

1524
01:57:51,275 --> 01:57:53,897
- Then consider it done.
- It sounds like Vijay to me!

1525
01:57:56,015 --> 01:57:56,800
Lets go.

1526
01:58:00,133 --> 01:58:02,346
No! I will not let it happen!

1527
01:58:03,317 --> 01:58:05,101
Mr. Banne, take me to Vijay.

1528
01:58:06,065 --> 01:58:07,605
Today you will witness...

1529
01:58:08,219 --> 01:58:09,827
...how I will kill my own son!

1530
01:58:11,078 --> 01:58:11,952
Only train will be there.

1531
01:58:14,017 --> 01:58:15,203
Now just wait and watch.

1532
01:58:17,824 --> 01:58:19,099
There are cabin on both
the sides of the bridge.

1533
01:58:19,817 --> 01:58:23,594
After half an hour of me leaving,
you will hijack the left side of the cabin.

1534
01:58:24,401 --> 01:58:24,948
Yes.

1535
01:58:25,430 --> 01:58:26,851
Till then I will...

1536
01:58:27,170 --> 01:58:30,162
...fit the dynamite charge
and run towards the cabin.

1537
01:58:30,962 --> 01:58:33,214
The train will be given a
green signal from there...

1538
01:58:33,961 --> 01:58:35,220
...and train will explode there.

1539
01:58:36,012 --> 01:58:37,265
They both are apt for this job.

1540
01:58:38,160 --> 01:58:39,538
- I will accompany you.
- No!

1541
01:58:40,626 --> 01:58:43,300
Well, cabin man might...

1542
01:58:43,921 --> 01:58:46,195
...suspect if more than one man goes.

1543
01:58:47,640 --> 01:58:49,120
But you are leaving
the dynamites right here.

1544
01:58:50,194 --> 01:58:51,602
They have turned pretty old.

1545
01:58:52,186 --> 01:58:54,222
Therefore I have brought new ones.
Check this out.

1546
01:58:55,008 --> 01:58:56,363
I will not take a chance today.

1547
01:58:58,873 --> 01:59:00,354
- Okay?
- Alright. Good luck!

1548
01:59:04,627 --> 01:59:05,324
Sankat!

1549
01:59:06,079 --> 01:59:06,989
Yes.

1550
01:59:08,027 --> 01:59:08,752
Sankat!

1551
01:59:11,441 --> 01:59:12,885
The one who you had attacked.

1552
01:59:13,130 --> 01:59:15,410
Sankat, he is Bichhoo!

1553
01:59:15,551 --> 01:59:16,277
Indeed.

1554
01:59:17,069 --> 01:59:20,416
It doesn't cares if it is friend
or enemy while stinging.

1555
01:59:21,779 --> 01:59:24,719
It seems you have lost your
senses because of that sting.

1556
01:59:25,875 --> 01:59:28,704
If I keep listening to your nonsense,
I'll miss the train.

1557
01:59:29,725 --> 01:59:31,702
You cannot bluff me any-more.

1558
01:59:32,881 --> 01:59:34,028
With that Solanki...

1559
01:59:34,887 --> 01:59:36,020
Solanki is in the jail.

1560
01:59:36,723 --> 01:59:37,974
How did you reach here?

1561
01:59:39,671 --> 01:59:40,833
You, rogue!

1562
01:59:42,322 --> 01:59:43,404
You are neither Solanki's aide...

1563
01:59:43,802 --> 01:59:44,735
...nor ours.

1564
01:59:44,914 --> 01:59:46,320
You are a policemen's aide!

1565
01:59:48,520 --> 01:59:51,164
Perhaps that's why he left the dynamite.

1566
02:00:08,535 --> 02:00:10,416
[SCOFFS] You...

1567
02:00:11,986 --> 02:00:14,186
I will harm you so badly...

1568
02:00:15,348 --> 02:00:16,482
So badly that you'll not...

1569
02:00:17,341 --> 02:00:18,940
...forget even after your death!

1570
02:02:26,279 --> 02:02:27,080
Mr. Banne!

1571
02:02:27,857 --> 02:02:28,997
Where are you?

1572
02:02:29,582 --> 02:02:31,301
Wait. I am coming.

1573
02:02:31,353 --> 02:02:33,485
- Hurry up!
- I'm coming.

1574
02:02:36,374 --> 02:02:37,988
Look.

1575
02:02:38,336 --> 02:02:39,321
It's just one way.

1576
02:02:39,832 --> 02:02:41,098
Whoever passes this way...

1577
02:02:41,350 --> 02:02:43,912
...will make contact to this
rope and you will know him.

1578
02:02:45,149 --> 02:02:45,727
Mr. Banne.

1579
02:02:46,268 --> 02:02:49,518
Go to the railway guys and alert them.

1580
02:02:51,095 --> 02:02:52,110
Uncle!

1581
02:02:52,940 --> 02:02:56,154
- How can I leave you alone and...
