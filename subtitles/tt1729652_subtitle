1
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,803
- Get back! Get back! Get back!

00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:58,731
- Listen. ls Tara there?

9
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:02,890
- No, man

10
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:23,250
- I guess her father didn't let her come.
I guess he doesn't like her meeting you or you meeting her.

11
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,808
- I know.

12
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,840
- Everyone knows you're trying to do your best.
But shouldn't you talk to the old man yourself?

13
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,284
- Everyone knows you're trying to do your best.
But shouldn't you talk to the old man yourself?

14
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:49,882
- You think he's going to ask you to "please marry my daughter?"

15
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:56,804
- If you were rich he'd say "Please marry my daughter immediately".

16
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:03,291
- That's the problem. I don't have anything.

17
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:17,528
- This is all I got man. You think anyone': going to be satisfied with this?

18
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:29,204
- I just started the business. Who gets rich overnight? Tell me.

19
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:44,811
- Well this is the only advice, I can give you.
Make sure you visit Tara's father this time.

20
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:00,126
- Let's go man.

21
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:07,290

34
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:59,040
- If you can't aim how are you going to impregnate your wife?

35
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,651
- Run man! it's the village drunkard.

36
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:07,166
- How dare you? When no ones at home...why you...

37
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,247
- Shit run, run for your life

38
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:32,166
- Whoa. Shit almost fell off.
- Stop pushing

39
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:43,764
- No matter where you go. There's no place like home you know.

41
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,889
-2 months. Boss wants me back soon.

42
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:59,849
- How's Malaysia? Earn a lot of money?

43
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:06,081
- There's money but the workload is heavy. Might even kill you.

44
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:12,002
- And the women? Sizzling hot?

45
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,685
- Always talks about women.

46
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:29,049

47
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,050

Tell us more about Malaysia.

50
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:52,245

00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,165
- Is it selling like hotcakes in the market?

58
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:38,171
- No. I just started this business.

59
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:44,325
- The place looks good

60
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,648

61
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,451
- Have you sent it to the city?

62
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,648

63
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,131
- I don't have a cataract or anything

64
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:04,371

66
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,611

72
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:37,001
- Yeah. The yaks and the way our dads used to...

73
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,088
- You still remember that?
- Of course I do.

74
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,842
- The old man used to chase us back home for causing so much trouble.

75
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:50,081
- When you're abroad, you tend to cling on to your childhood memories.

76
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,841
- Oh! I got you something.
- What?

77
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,963
- Don't laugh

80
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:14,440

84
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:31,040
- Will we reach by tomorrow morning?
- Only if we walk all night. This place isn't safe to walk at night.

85
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:40,045
- Will we reach by tomorrow morning?
- Only if we walk all night. This place isn't safe to walk at night.

86

- Shit its cold

87
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:50,040
- I told you no one can predict the weather.
Let's find a place to crash for the night.

88
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:59,568
- I told you no one can predict the weather.
Let's find a place to crash for the night.

89
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,643
- Alright. We're spending the night here.

90
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:37,685
- What is this place?

91
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:42,406
- Should I light the fire?
- Yes I'm freezing.

92
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,087
- You travel this way often?

93
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,082
- Once a month...

94
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:26,330
- Alone? Every month? Don't you get tired?

95
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:34,046
- Does it really help your business?

96
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:44,043
- Its enough to get me by... but its nothing like what I want.

97
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:56,889
- I don't have an option. Not everyone can go to Malaysia like you.

98
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:06,443
- To move ahead in life you have to sign a contract
with a distillery in the city.

99
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:12,443
- You can't do this alone forever.

100
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,086
- You have to work hard but you also need to use your brain.

101
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:26,841
- If you do what I'm telling you,
your business will surely do better.

102
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:32,171
- I really wish life was a little easier.

103
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:38,602
- My life isn't as different from these mules.

104
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:19,806
- Go!

105
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:30,122

- What is this?

115
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:36,640
- This paw is more than a thousand years old.
It belonged to a monkey that had magical powers'

116
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,129
- This paw is more than a thousand years old.
It belonged to a monkey that had magical powers'

117
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:48,570
W anyone holds the paw, that person is granted his wish.

118
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:57,846
- What the... these mules are making a lot of noise. Flt be right back.

119
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:09,008
- But remember one thing. Only it's rightful owner can use the paw.

120
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:18,122
Remember.“ if a wish is made by anyone else
other than you then there will be consequences...

121
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,564
- What happened to the mules?

122
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:04,600
- I have no idea. Must be the cold. Lets go to sleep now.

123
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,285
- I have no idea. Must be the cold. Lets go to sleep now.

Jlamesh! Get up! Its morning.

126
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:14,809
- When did you wake up?
- A while ago.

127
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:20,802
- That holy man“...
- What?

128
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:29,169
- He's gone.
- Who cares where he's gone.

129
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:36,687
- Hey did he take your blanket?
- No. Its right here

130
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:42,841

00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:47,880
- Yeah... he was a little weird. There has been some weird happenings in the
village.

132

134
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:10,800
- He was something...well we better get going.

135
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,325
- He was something...well we better get going.
- Ok. Lets go

136
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:25,600
- Look at us, still picking it up by hand. Abroad, they only use machines.

137
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:35,367
- Look at us, still picking it up by hand. Abroad, they only use machines.

138
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:42,649
- What? They use machines to put load on the animals.

139
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:52,442
- They don't use animals. They use automobiles, ships, planes.

140
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:57,924
- I wonder if I'll ever get to see such machines being used.

141
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:03,091
- May be in a hundred years.

142
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:37,766
- Sir, excuse me, are you there?

146
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:53,209
- The goods look like they've been torn apart.

147
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:56,083
- They're just a little ripped.

148
00:34:56,120 --> 00:35:02,685
- Ok. Fine. What is that? Making blankets as well?

149
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:05,165
- No Sir, it belongs to my friend.

150
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:07,566
- And who is he?

151
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:13,881

- You're still the same.

197
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:47,044
- That's why Gyanu's father chased you for flirting with her.
Don't you remember?

198
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:50,163

- Bardaan! You're coming with me.

302
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:51,681
You never complete your assignments.

Always skipping class I 'will tell your father about this.

309
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:51,405
- Want more rice?

314
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,924

316
01:06:59,120 --> 01:07:02,249

- This time I'll give you 5 rupees less on each bottle...

321
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:39,923
but the amount that I want, you probably might not even sell in 10 years
time.

322
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:44,960
- It takes you months to prepare your brandy and overnight it drunk in the city.

326
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:04,405

327
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:14,009
- 5000 for now. It will increase there after

01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:17,931
- Are you kidding me?

329
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:21,601
- Why should U

330
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:26,521
- 5000? It will take me a long time to make that.

331
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:28,927
' HOW long?

332
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:36,526
- Well... The apples from last year alone...

333
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:50,523
- The apples from last year alone aren't enough so it will take about 2-3
months.

334
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:02,128
- Alright. But not Longer than 3 months

335
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:04,731
- Yes definitely. You don't have to worry about it.

336
01:09:04,760 --> 01:09:08,128
- That means... Lets sign a contract then.

337
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:09,730
- Yes sir for sure.

338
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:17,565
- How about this? I WM give you an advance now...

339
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:23,607
- Thank you. That will certainly help me to move ahead with the work.

340
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:27,929
- Alright then...I'll be back with the money.
- 0k sir.

341
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:32,887
- Ramesh, don't forget to bring your fingers with you!

342
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:35,002
- What?

343
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:39,682
- Your thumbs. You don't know how to sign, right?

344
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:44,521
- Ok sir. I got it.

345
01:09:51,520 --> 01:10:00,565
- After toiling for nearly ten years, he is about to make it finally.
Do you know how hard he has worked?

346
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:05,447
- Does that mean you're moving to the city?

347
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:13,291
- The city? We were born here and we'll die here.
If we leave this place who's going to take care of the business.

348
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:16,722
- Its good to stay in your own village.

349
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:21,760
- Yes it is. We have food and shelter, and we make enough to get by. In fact
it's getting better by the day. Why leave and go to the city? I don't want to.

350
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:29,923
- Yes it is. We have food and shelter, and we make enough to get by. In fact
it's getting better by the day. Why leave and go to the city? I don't want to.

351
01:10:56,840 --> 01:11:00,561
- How did it go?

352
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:06,164
- You tell me. What do you think?
- It's done!

353
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:09,204
- Yes.

354
01:11:09,240 --> 01:11:17,125
- Advance is 1 lakh 37 thousands and will give the rest after the work is done.

355
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:25,601
- Disgusting!
- I thought it was stinking.

356
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:30,845
- Are you going to hire more people at the factory?

357
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:37,240
- People? I'm thinking about getting a machine.

358
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:44,209
It takes a whole day for Z people to chop 20 kilos of apple, the machine takes a
minute.

359
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:46,641
- Isn't the machine expensive?

360
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:53,609
- Of course it is.
Add to that transportation cost of bringing it to the village“.

361
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:58,009
Once I buy it, it'll be ours forever.

362
01:11:58,040 --> 01:12:05,891
- Now, I don't know anything about that, why should I advise you?

363
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:11,847
- Has Bardaan gone to sleep?
- Yes he did.

364
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:16,522
- I was thinking about sending him to a good school...

365
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:20,246
what's that English school's name inl the next village?

366
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:24,285
- Oh that's called Saraswati Boarding School.

367
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:29,850
- Yes. Right. I hear it's good. We should send Bardaan there.

368
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:32,724
- Wash your hands and feet, I'm heating dinner.

369
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:35,764
- Wait, listen to me...

370
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:42,169
- Please keep the money safe.

371
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:19,565
- Greetings elder!
- Greetings!

372
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:26,563
- I would like to buy your apple yield this year. I'll pay you good money for it.

373
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:34,166
- Well, why do you want to buy my yield? You have enough of your own.

374
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:36,885
- This time, I need a lot more than usual.

375
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:43,405
- He's got a big order from the city this time.
That's why he needs more than the usual yield.

376
01:13:43,439 --> 01:13:48,081
- Ok then. I'll sell you what I yield.

377
01:13:48,120 --> 01:13:54,366
- Well that's great news! You don't have to go to the city to sell it
nor do you have to throw away the rotten ones.

378
01:13:54,399 --> 01:14:02,648
- 0k then. I'm going to take your word for it.
I'll come by day after and give you an advance...

379
01:14:02,680 --> 01:14:10,041
- I don't need an advance right now.
The apples still look like tomatoesmpay me when they're ripe .

380
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:12,686
- 0k then. Thank you

381
01:14:29,320 --> 01:14:32,369
- How many people do you need to transport the machine?

382
01:14:32,399 --> 01:14:35,369
- One's enough, don't need anymore.

383
01:14:35,399 --> 01:14:38,243
- Here's the money.

384
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:44,083
- Hey Bardaan. Stop playing with my watch before you break it.
- I won't.

385
01:14:44,120 --> 01:14:48,250
- Here give it to me.

386
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:53,411
- I talked to the elder; he's promised to sell me his yield.

387
01:14:53,439 --> 01:14:56,841
- For how much?

388
01:14:56,880 --> 01:15:01,880
- Haven't talked about money yet. I'll talk about it when I get back.
He's a man of his word. I'm going to wear this.

389
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:07,927
- Haven't talked about money yet. I'll talk about it when I get back.
He's a man of his word. I'm going to wear this.

390
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:11,761
- If we're done packing, let's go eat.

391
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:13,882
- See

392
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:19,609
- Hand that to me. I told you he'd break it.

393
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:21,608
- Why didn't you listen?

394
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:28,646
- I guess I'll fix it in the city.

395
01:15:28,680 --> 01:15:32,685
- Let's go eat.

396
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:37,963

you'll be sorry.

400
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:06,441
- A toy-plane.

401
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:11,082
- A toy-plane? Ok then... I'm off.

- I wish everyday were like this.

417
01:18:48,920 --> 01:18:50,968
- Where's Bardaan?

418
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,970
- He's gone out to play.

419
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:40,000

water from the well. He found a book. The book had pictures of trees, houses...

439
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:38,004
Forget it.

- It': the same paw. You still have it with you?

455
01:29:29,720 --> 01:29:31,404
- What is that?

456
01:29:31,439 --> 01:29:32,964

- So tell me...

458
01:29:36,160 --> 01:29:41,530
- Ramesh and I, met a holy man a longtime ago.

459
01:29:41,560 --> 01:29:49,001
- He gave me the paw when I gave the old man a warm blanket for the night.
He told me that it was a magical paw'

460
01:29:49,040 --> 01:29:54,206
- Magical paw? What kind of magic? He's never told me about it. x

461
01:29:54,240 --> 01:29:56,846
- The kind that makes you wishes come true.

462
01:29:56,880 --> 01:30:03,081
- Wishes come true? Have you tried it?

463
01:30:04,399 --> 01:30:13,444
- I haven't. But I think it works. Don”: you think so?

464
01:30:16,160 --> 01:30:19,562
- I don't know. Maybe.

465
01:30:24,320 --> 01:30:26,084
- Should I ask for something then?

466
01:30:26,120 --> 01:30:28,885
- Why do you need to? Give it here!

467
01:30:39,280 --> 01:30:43,080
- Let's go. it's late

468
01:30:54,240 --> 01:31:03,126

472
01:31:24,520 --> 01:31:28,605
- Here. This is your room.

473
01:31:33,680 --> 01:31:36,763
- I must have put you in a lot of trouble.

474
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:45,811
- What makes you say that? You've come after so many years.
Think of this as your own home.

475
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:51,006
- You must be tired. Go to sleep. Shut the door.

476
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:58,766
- Listen! Ask if you need anything, we're right here.

477
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:05,961
- What is it? Why cause all that noise?

478
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:09,163
- Your friend?

479
01:36:09,200 --> 01:36:11,168
- What about him?

480
01:36:11,200 --> 01:36:13,407
- Did you open the door for him?

481
01:36:13,439 --> 01:36:15,248
- No. I didn't. Why?

482
01:36:15,280 --> 01:36:17,328
- Didn't you open the door for him in the morning?

483
01:36:17,360 --> 01:36:20,204
- What are you saying? No. I didn't.

484
01:36:20,240 --> 01:36:26,327
- The door was open this morning and when I peeped in he wasn't there.

485
01:36:26,360 --> 01:36:35,644
- Even the main door is locked from inside. If the door was locked how did he
leave?

486
01:36:35,680 --> 01:36:38,126
- What are you talking about?

487
01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:06,011
- Did you make the bed?

488
01:37:06,040 --> 01:37:09,522
- No. I didn't. It was already made.

489
01:37:10,840 --> 01:37:13,207
- Who is he?

01:38:44,280 --> 01:38:50,322
- Son. Don't play with that. I m tired of scolding him.

492
01:38:56,640 --> 01:39:00,645
- Its pretty windy today.

493
01:39:02,760 --> 01:39:03,841

495
01:39:07,600 --> 01:39:10,649

01:39:20,680 --> 01:39:21,363
- About 500 with the help of last year's fruits, now I need to wait for the new
yield.

498
01:39:22,200 --> 01:39:26,046
- That means we have to wait another month? Right?

499
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:35,721
- What else can I do? I have to wait.

500
01:39:37,760 --> 01:39:45,008

- Its even worse for me. My wife passed away last year, everything is over.
I don't know if I can go on like this.

505

- Its even worse for me. My wife passed away last year, everything is over.
I don't know if I can go on like this.

There's only a weeks time left. How am I going to get 4500 bottles now?

507
01:43:18,640 --> 01:43:19,368
There's only a weeks time left. How am I going to get 4500 bottles now?

508
01:43:25,400 --> 01:43:27,243
- <i>Tea.</i>

509
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:30,651
- I did search the entire village.

510
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:38,166
- There's not a single apple left.

511
01:43:42,280 --> 01:43:47,280
- What can we do? Everyone knows about the storm. We're not trying to cheat
him.

512
01:43:52,280 --> 01:43:52,690
- What can we do? Everyone knows about the storm. We're not trying to cheat
him.

513
01:43:56,400 --> 01:44:02,169
- Why don't you talk to him once. May be he can wait till the next season?

514
01:44:06,760 --> 01:44:13,006
- I don't think he'll listen.

515
01:44:16,560 --> 01:44:23,250
- When I signed the contract...he kept repeating that sentence...

516
01:44:25,840 --> 01:44:29,401
- Why would he listen?

517
01:44:36,560 --> 01:44:43,603
- Why don't you try? If he disagrees, we'll think of something else.

518
01:44:53,440 --> 01:44:56,967
- Please don't worry.

519
01:44:59,200 --> 01:45:01,931
- Why shouldn't I?

520
01:45:13,360 --> 01:45:17,684
- Do you think this is a joke?

521
01:45:21,880 --> 01:45:25,441
- Do you know how long it took me to get to your remote village?

522
01:45:27,520 --> 01:45:31,525
- You're telling me there's only 500 bottles?

523
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:33,842
- Please give me a month."

524
01:45:33,880 --> 01:45:42,322

your responsibility to meet the demand. Don't you think so?

525

- If not then, you have to pay the money back with interest of the past 3
months.

528
01:46:01,960 --> 01:46:04,691
- What do you think of yourself?

529
01:46:05,040 --> 01:46:10,285
- I'll be back in a week. Be prepared.

530

his livelihood and the old man... hanged himself... poor old soul.

535
01:47:42,400 --> 01:47:46,405
- His wife just passed away last year, then last weeks storm destroyed
his livelihood and the old man... hanged himself... poor old soul.

536
01:47:49,240 --> 01:47:53,882

- Why did he have to hang himself?

548
01:49:26,640 --> 01:49:35,560
- He owed a lot of people money and his crops were destroyed.

549
01:49:39,840 --> 01:49:42,844
- I guess he gave up all hope.

550

02:00:33,800 --> 02:00:35,882
- The paw.

589
02:00:36,360 --> 02:00:38,966
- The one your friend brought with him.

590
02:00:39,440 --> 02:00:42,728
- Where is that paw? Where is it Tara?

591
02:00:44,200 --> 02:00:46,202
- I have it-.

592
02:00:47,920 --> 02:00:50,321
- I think it really works.

593
02:00:50,360 --> 02:00:56,402
- I had made a wish for our problem be solved. That's how we repaid the
money.

594
02:00:57,360 --> 02:01:02,605
- You made a big mistake Tara. Why didn't you tell me about it?

595
02:01:02,640 --> 02:01:06,167
- What did I do? What wrong did I do?

596
02:01:06,200 --> 02:01:11,604
- That paw brings bad luck. It's dangerous. Give it to me.

597
02:01:11,640 --> 02:01:14,211
- How do you know about it?

598
02:01:22,680 --> 02:01:27,686
- When Krishna received that paw, I was there.

599
02:01:29,800 --> 02:01:32,451
- I wished for something as well

600
02:01:34,280 --> 02:01:40,128
- but Krishna didn't know about that.
He fell from the cliff to his death the very next day.

601
02:01:47,240 --> 02:01:49,846
- That could be a coincidence.

602
02:01:49,880 --> 02:01:52,850
- That was not a coincidence Tara.

603
02:01:52,880 --> 02:01:55,804
- It's the paw that killed our son!

604
02:02:13,600 --> 02:02:18,242
- That means that paw can bring him back.

605
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:21,729
- Tara!

606
02:02:24,280 --> 02:02:31,129
- Wait Tara! Wait!

607
02:02:31,560 --> 02:02:35,121
- Tell me where is it? Give it to me. Tara. Give it to me.

608
02:02:36,720 --> 02:02:38,131
- Give it to me. Tara.

609
02:02:39,240 --> 02:02:44,883
- Tara. Tara. Tara. Give it to me.

610
02:02:45,360 --> 02:02:48,569
- Listen to me. That paw will only make matters worse.

611
02:02:48,600 --> 02:02:55,882
- I know Krishna died! He didn't even have the paw with him when he fell.

612
02:02:55,920 --> 02:03:00,847
- Did you forget how he disappeared that morning?
Tara. Something is trying to trick us Tara“.

613
02:03:00,880 --> 02:03:09,083
- I don't believe anything. I don't believe you. I want my son back.
- Give the paw to me.

614
02:03:09,120 --> 02:03:14,120
- Please leave me. Leave! I want my son back. Return my son to me!
Please return my son back to me. Let go of me.

615
02:03:19,120 --> 02:03:24,570
- Please leave me. Leave! I want my son back. Return my son to me!
Please return my son back to me. Let go of me.

616
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:31,000
- Mom, open the door. Mom, let me enter.
- My son! Bardaan!

617
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:36,967
- Mom, open the door. Mom, let me enter.
- My son! Bardaan!

618
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:42,404
- I don't want my son. I don't want Bardaan!

619
02:03:45,800 --> 02:03:50,800
- My son, my son. Where is he?

620
02:03:55,800 --> 02:03:56,210
- My son, my son. Where is he?

621
02:03:56,240 --> 02:03:59,926
- Tara, Tara

622
02:06:09,320 --> 02:06:15,601
- Now...we don't want anything.
