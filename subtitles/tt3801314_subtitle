1
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:15,038
Hunting him for the past 4 years and
we have just arrested him 2 days back.

2
00:02:15,735 --> 00:02:17,578
Now he had escaped from the jail!

3
00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:20,711
He escaped even there is much of security.

4
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:23,145
If this is know by the public is
going to be a big disgrace.

5
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,017
How are we going to catch him now?

6
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:29,316
Sir,I have an idea.

7
00:02:29,749 --> 00:02:33,561
There is a criminal in this jail now
whom had escaped from here 18 times.

8
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:36,133
If we ask him we can get some idea
on how to catch him back.

9
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:42,463
So, you would like to catch him
back using my ideas, is that right.

10
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:45,098
How long is it been?

11
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:47,300
Just a few minutes back,
let's go.

12
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:50,707
Let's go?
What will be our deal?

13
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:51,343
Deal?

14
00:02:52,071 --> 00:02:57,071
YA. Deal like for an example getting me a fan,
hand phone just for me in this whole jail.

15
00:03:02,715 --> 00:03:03,591
You got to be kidding me!

16
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:07,259
You're getting paid and I must
do your job is it?

17
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,031
You mean do it for you for free.

18
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:12,291
I guess we have to listen to him?

19
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:18,504
20km away and we can only
catch him if we leave now.

20
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:19,499
Deal.

21
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:23,138
Bring me your jail blueprint.

22
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:29,312
Which one is the criminal's cell?

23
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:09,058
I will guess the way he would have ran,
just run behind me.

24
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:51,330
Come to the east side
tunnel out of the jail.

25
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:54,262
Come there by your jeeps.

26
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:19,060
Follow me fast!

27
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:47,024
This way, come on!

28
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:22,058
Shoot his knee!

29
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:38,998
No one should know that we
caught him using the other criminal!

30
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:44,338
Where is he?
Where did he go?

31
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:46,181
He escaped.

32
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:57,458
Since he escaped, update that Kathiresan had killed
3 cops and ran away from the jail.

33
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:37,716
How come he is here?

34
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:42,023
<i>HI.</i>

35
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:44,454
How come you're released?

36
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:46,092
I released myself.

37
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:47,626
This is what they call it own release is it?

38
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,292
How come you know I'm here?

39
00:09:49,555 --> 00:09:55,005
I contacted Marimuthu in Vellore jail,
he told me you were released a month ago.

40
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:57,005
That is how.

41
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,338
Where is your jail clothes?

42
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:01,567
I took it off in the train itself.

43
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:07,376
Looks like that will be enough for the cops to catch you
since they have cameras all over the railway station.

44
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:09,116
You did not take the cab
from the station right?

45
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:10,548
Yes I did just at the railway entrance.

46
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:13,114
Why didn't you just give my address at
the nearest police station before coming here!

47
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,190
Hey, that's wrong than you'll be busted.

48
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:16,392
Looks like he is scanning.

49
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:19,228
There is no any money,
he found it.

50
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:25,091
Buy me a toothbrush, paste and also a soap.

51
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,469
Get all of it in small size since
I'm leaving to Bangkok tomorrow morning.

52
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:29,637
Passport!

53
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:32,366
You are the one going to get me a
fake passport using you're influence.

54
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:43,648
Look, I have used all my money
to get this passport for you.

55
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:45,113
Ones you have reached Bangkok?

56
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:46,155
Surely I will not forget you.

57
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:49,087
Please do forget me and
not come back to India.

58
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:51,021
Now fill up the form first.

59
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:00,502
Looks like they have
mentioned sex in the form itself.

60
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:03,135
They are asking is it man or woman.

61
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:04,966
Surely with woman right?

62
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:07,032
Gone case.

63
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:09,104
He has mentioned male in his form,
beware of him.

64
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:13,617
Who the hack is that?

65
00:11:32,224 --> 00:11:33,168
What happen?

66
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,539
That girl took the pen.

67
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:47,481
Must somehow get her.

68
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:51,043
You will be in India for half an hour
more and you want to fall in love is it?

69
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:53,751
Sorry madam no change.

70
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:57,685
What is the matter?

71
00:11:57,817 --> 00:11:58,557
I have no change.

72
00:11:58,818 --> 00:11:59,819
I have!

73
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:09,402
That's my wallet!

74
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:11,164
Here you go.

75
00:12:23,642 --> 00:12:25,246
That uncle is a bad boy,
don't talk with him.

76
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:28,518
Do you need more change?

77
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:34,156
You are going to the toilet
so do you need small change to pay?

78
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,691
It is free over here.

79
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:41,764
I don't know what to say.

80
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:47,442
Hey look, there is a
guy keep on looking at you.

81
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,777
Wait for awhile.

82
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,678
Hey she is coming.

83
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,042
Did you steal her necklace.

84
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:58,421
Noooooo.

85
00:12:58,644 --> 00:12:59,520
Shall we run?

86
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:07,387
I need to talk with you personally?

87
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:11,534
Isn't she saying personally,
Go!

88
00:13:12,024 --> 00:13:13,401
My name is Angita.

89
00:13:14,026 --> 00:13:16,233
I loved someone 2 years back.

90
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:18,364
They have killed him.

91
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:23,972
But now he is here.

92
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:26,743
Look behind.

93
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,716
I thought you said that he was murdered.

94
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:37,386
Where?

95
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:39,552
Look over there.

96
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:51,332
I cannot see anyone??

97
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:54,005
Look at the mirror?

98
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:01,116
The Fly?

99
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:04,384
He has reborn as a ﬂy.

100
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:08,012
Yes, I saw him following
you to the toilet as well.

101
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:11,290
No that's the original ﬂy,
he would have been outside waiting for me.

102
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:13,392
He had revenged
everyone whom had murdered him.

103
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:20,993
But, now he is asking me to marry you?

104
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:25,434
I am really not sure what to do now?

105
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,735
Thank you Fly.

106
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:31,743
Now you're going overseas.

107
00:14:32,571 --> 00:14:36,678
I am going to send off my
uncle's family and go back home.

108
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:41,785
My number is 9444404296

109
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:46,323
If you come back, we shall meet.

110
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,030
What's up, she asked your whatsapp ID is it?

111
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:10,537
Hey, why are you tearing the ticket.
Bought it with all the money I stole.

112
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:12,149
Hey, why are you tearing the ticket.
Bought it with all the money I stole.

113
00:19:30,068 --> 00:19:33,072
She is going to be shocked
hearing me not ﬂying off.

114
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:36,116
Good evening, Chennai corporations.

115
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:40,050
This is Angita's number right?

116
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,089
Angita??

117
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:44,558
This is the dog catcher department.

118
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:50,017
If there is street dogs in your area let
us know, we will send our people to catch it.

119
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:06,673
Do you know how much is the ﬂight ticket?

120
00:20:07,072 --> 00:20:10,781
Do you know how hard is to steal nowadays?

121
00:20:11,176 --> 00:20:14,123
Try to snatch a ladies necklace,
than only you will know how to value money.

122
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:20,193
Took a wrong number and got yourself fooled.

123
00:20:57,522 --> 00:20:59,160
He looks exactly like you?

124
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:05,569
How is this possible.

125
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:15,140
We can safe him if we rush to the hospital
since he is shot at the right side of his body.

126
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:37,530
Sodhu, you handle him since I
and him look alike.

127
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:57,316
They have removed the bullets,
but he is short of blood.

128
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:58,286
What is this?

129
00:21:58,450 --> 00:21:59,258
His things.

130
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:05,366
They have informed the cops since it's gunshot.
We must leave before the cops arrive.

131
00:22:10,295 --> 00:22:11,239
Tell me dude.

132
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:14,539
When??

133
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:22,652
What happened?

134
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,988
The cops came looking
for you at my house?

135
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:28,081
They have accused you for
killing 3 cops while you escaped from jail.

136
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,153
The cops took my number
from the house owner.

137
00:22:30,582 --> 00:22:33,756
They might trace me and arrive here,
lets bounce.

138
00:22:37,155 --> 00:22:39,328
Looks like all the cops are behind us now.

139
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:44,036
What is it?

140
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:49,100
Give me that?

141
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:50,444
This is his?

142
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:01,990
What are you doing?

143
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:04,458
Have you registered the patients
name yet at the receptionist?

144
00:23:04,516 --> 00:23:06,553
Nope, we don't even know who is he?

145
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:13,995
Fill up my name as his
and leave this beside him.

146
00:23:14,092 --> 00:23:17,005
The cops from Calcutta will think it's
me and bring him back to jail.

147
00:23:17,095 --> 00:23:18,597
This is cheating?

148
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:27,108
Police will find out it's not me when he is in the jail.
That time is enough for me to leave to Bangkok.

149
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:45,693
Let's go.
He will be in Calcutta Jail when he heals.

150
00:24:00,138 --> 00:24:01,708
Why is the cop coming towards us?

151
00:24:02,174 --> 00:24:04,313
Maybe we can develop
this place to an airport.

152
00:24:06,311 --> 00:24:08,416
The home minister is
calling the both of you.

153
00:24:09,347 --> 00:24:10,382
Home minister?

154
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:16,494
Phone; We must complete
the orders in our district.

155
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:23,763
Phone; I will meet the officers personally and
you get the green card holders details as well.

156
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:28,110
Turn to the left and head to Tamburam,
you know the place right.

157
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:36,313
I have gotten the 250000 that
you requested from the home minister.

158
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,485
Yes, give it to me.

159
00:24:44,249 --> 00:24:46,490
If you pass it to us,
we will just get down by the roadside.

160
00:24:51,556 --> 00:24:56,062
Lucky is not a cheque but DD.

161
00:24:56,194 --> 00:25:00,006
Sir if you drop us in the
bank we will draw this out.

162
00:25:06,571 --> 00:25:10,485
Stop the car.
Look the minister is here again.

163
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:13,646
Get lost from here!

164
00:25:16,481 --> 00:25:18,154
How many times to tell you?

165
00:25:19,417 --> 00:25:20,657
Jeeva?

166
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:22,992
Jeeva is here!

167
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:27,028
Is it.
Please come, please come.

168
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:31,107
Where were you the whole night yesterday?

169
00:25:33,598 --> 00:25:38,411
Sorry, because we were
upset that Jeeva was missing.

170
00:25:39,104 --> 00:25:41,778
We were all worried that something
had cost your life.

171
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:44,185
Looks like you have brought
him back safe and sound.

172
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,378
It's not me but him.

173
00:25:46,578 --> 00:25:47,716
I meet the on the way here.

174
00:25:48,146 --> 00:25:49,216
Thank you very much !!

175
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:50,185
It's ok.

176
00:25:51,116 --> 00:25:52,754
At least now you all are
no longer angry with me.

177
00:25:53,018 --> 00:25:55,055
I have passed him the
250000 for all of you all to him.

178
00:25:55,186 --> 00:25:58,099
How many time we have said
that we don't want the money!

179
00:25:59,157 --> 00:26:03,299
The other day how much we bagged,
did you listen! listen! listen!

180
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:05,439
Take your money!

181
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:12,979
Ok. I will leave.

182
00:26:13,471 --> 00:26:16,008
Jeeva, follow me for awhile.

183
00:26:18,777 --> 00:26:23,192
What am I to do. The situation the other
day was such. Please try to convince them.

184
00:26:23,615 --> 00:26:26,653
I'll come next week bringing
the same 250000 DD.

185
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:34,070
Sir, pass me the DD without their knowledge,
and I will convince them later on.

186
00:26:36,227 --> 00:26:37,433
That sounds good.

187
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:39,201
It will be better if it is cash money.

188
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,573
Government do not pay by cash son.

189
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,143
You are such a nice person.

190
00:26:44,202 --> 00:26:45,272
Ok, I will make a move first.

191
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:51,714
We are going to be here
till we receive the money.

192
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,262
There is small issue.

193
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:13,109
Jeeva is still alive.

194
00:27:22,607 --> 00:27:28,182
You told me that 5 people took him down,
were the bullets fake?

195
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,552
I am not sure but there
wasn't any bullets hit his body.

196
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:36,959
NOT EVEN ONE!!!

197
00:27:43,261 --> 00:27:45,036
I will deal this myself.

198
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:50,670
Just wait they might give us something to eat
after the prayers, we shall leave after that.

199
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,526
Why are they praying to these humans?

200
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:06,962
Today is all of their death anniversary.

201
00:28:07,318 --> 00:28:09,924
How come 6 of them in the same day?

202
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:11,226
<i>All of the together...</i>

203
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:14,227
Here light up this and finish the prayers.

204
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:21,000
All our village children's and
ladies are fasting till it's over.

205
00:28:31,776 --> 00:28:33,449
How did all of them die on the same day?

206
00:28:34,979 --> 00:28:37,516
They committed suicide together.

207
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:39,324
Why?

208
00:28:39,617 --> 00:28:41,221
To safe Jeeva's life?

209
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:47,966
To safe one's 6 committed suicide?

210
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:51,433
Yes, Jeeve is this home in charge.

211
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:56,241
The 10 people over there
is his village people.

212
00:28:57,102 --> 00:29:00,549
Me and the rest are from different villages.

213
00:29:06,945 --> 00:29:11,394
Kathiri This is not a safe place for us since 6 people
committed suicide just to safe Jeeva's life.

214
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,921
But you have send him behind
bars and taken over his place.

215
00:29:16,454 --> 00:29:18,957
<i>If they know the truth...</i>

216
00:29:19,657 --> 00:29:26,233
Heyyy, Just one week and we will swindle
the 250000 and get out of here.

217
00:29:26,731 --> 00:29:29,712
Besides that this is the safest
place to be before Bangkok.

218
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:31,605
<i>Safe? Here..</i>

219
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:36,610
The first time when we saw him also 5 people were gunning
him down, and you claim that it's safe here at his place.

220
00:29:41,045 --> 00:29:44,686
What you are thinking is right too.
We shall leave tomorrow morning.

221
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:46,391
That is what l call a good boy.

222
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:50,665
It's my responsibility to send you to Bangkok in another
<i>2</i> days and you will have a bright future after that.

223
00:29:56,628 --> 00:30:00,303
This house looked haunted in the day itself,
I wonder who is it now at this time.

224
00:30:02,066 --> 00:30:02,510
GHOST!

225
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,273
Jeeva! Kishore Lal is sick terribly.

226
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:06,073
He looked very happy in the morning?

227
00:30:06,171 --> 00:30:07,980
Please come fast his breath is slowing down!

228
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:11,687
I wished this was a ladies hostel.

229
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:21,092
Somebody get a transport and
lets head to the hospital.

230
00:30:21,252 --> 00:30:22,356
The doctor is on his was here.

231
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:24,031
Have you all inform his family?

232
00:30:24,189 --> 00:30:27,170
We are keep trying but there is no answer.

233
00:30:27,425 --> 00:30:29,098
Did you try their handphone?

234
00:30:29,194 --> 00:30:32,198
Same no answer so I have
leave back a message.

235
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:34,341
If that is the case someone go to his house
and ask them to answer their phones.

236
00:30:35,266 --> 00:30:40,079
Our home rules is to inform their house
and the cops if there is any issue with them.

237
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:44,787
There is no need of cops,
just wait a moment.

238
00:30:45,543 --> 00:30:48,353
You don't worry everything will be fine.

239
00:30:49,647 --> 00:30:50,819
I want to see my childrens.

240
00:30:51,249 --> 00:30:54,628
That's what we are trying
but no one is attending the call.

241
00:30:54,819 --> 00:30:56,093
Please breath in and
out as deep as you can.

242
00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:57,764
There is someone from
his house here already.

243
00:30:58,056 --> 00:30:58,761
Who is that?

244
00:32:04,622 --> 00:32:07,660
Looks like he have cured the heart attack
by just eating a bun. It's a medical miracle.

245
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:13,099
Hey my back is itchy,
please scratch it for me.

246
00:32:13,364 --> 00:32:14,638
Where is your hand?

247
00:32:17,568 --> 00:32:18,638
It's the hand which touched her face buddy.

248
00:32:24,175 --> 00:32:27,645
This is how a friend is treated
when it comes to girls.

249
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:40,121
I cheated you the other day without knowing you
are they in charge over here for the old folks home.

250
00:33:42,253 --> 00:33:43,527
Can you do me a small favour?

251
00:33:45,757 --> 00:33:46,394
Tell me?

252
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:49,230
You must help me to slap the wad counselor.

253
00:33:52,263 --> 00:33:53,333
Are you playing the fool?

254
00:33:54,065 --> 00:33:58,411
How can I slap someone whom I don't know.
No way.

255
00:33:59,604 --> 00:34:02,346
Ok. I make a move ﬁrst.

256
00:34:03,007 --> 00:34:04,145
1 minute.

257
00:34:04,475 --> 00:34:07,945
Actually why did you ask me so?

258
00:34:08,346 --> 00:34:08,949
What?

259
00:34:09,414 --> 00:34:13,556
You ask me to slap someone.

260
00:34:14,252 --> 00:34:19,252
That is because, morning the counselor
slapped and night you, but your slap was harder.

261
00:34:27,098 --> 00:34:29,442
That is why I feel that you can slap him.

262
00:34:33,638 --> 00:34:36,050
Why did he slap you?

263
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:41,182
I complained about mosquitoes in my area,
so while the argument he slapped me.

264
00:34:45,383 --> 00:34:50,025
Ok I will help but how shall I come.

265
00:34:50,321 --> 00:34:58,138
Ok, I will fetch you with my bike
after I get ready.

266
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:03,336
Hey, shall we move,
I took some of Jeeva's clothes.

267
00:35:03,534 --> 00:35:05,070
I'm not coming,
you go.

268
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:08,083
Hey, we decided yesterday that we are
leaving from here today right.

269
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:13,517
That was yesterday, now I'm telling no.

270
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:19,653
I'm going to go get
ready to go with that girl.

271
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:42,479
Hey I have to go out so you be here take care of
the old folks by giving them all the medicines.

272
00:35:43,107 --> 00:35:48,022
There is one man having piles,
please help him also.

273
00:35:48,446 --> 00:35:49,982
And for the other man...

274
00:35:50,114 --> 00:35:50,558
Bum him is it?

275
00:35:50,748 --> 00:35:53,558
Hey what a joke,
remind me of this later I will laugh.

276
00:35:59,757 --> 00:36:01,065
How is my grandfather now?

277
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:03,105
Who cares, come lets go.

278
00:36:03,628 --> 00:36:06,973
He is ﬁne.

279
00:36:09,433 --> 00:36:11,538
Just one slap and she likes me.

280
00:41:49,306 --> 00:41:50,717
What is the reason I am arrested?

281
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:01,386
You all have wrongly brought me.

282
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,108
Sir, this is not Kathir.

283
00:42:29,113 --> 00:42:31,093
If I'm not there everything
will be ruined sir.

284
00:42:33,684 --> 00:42:40,101
There is some confusion, place him in the private room
most importantly do not let him communicate with others.

285
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:58,247
Who are these,
looks like from the TV station.

286
00:42:58,642 --> 00:42:59,620
Hi English ladies.

287
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:02,580
We are here to interview Mr. Jeeva.

288
00:46:00,691 --> 00:46:03,638
Hey what you have done to the girls.
They will look down about India.

289
00:46:04,495 --> 00:46:05,667
Come let me have a look.

290
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:11,606
Where are the reporters?

291
00:46:15,038 --> 00:46:17,018
Why there are knifes,
what did you do to them?

292
00:46:17,341 --> 00:46:21,585
I did not do anything, they try to
murder me.

293
00:46:25,015 --> 00:46:28,724
Kill him, again.

294
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:37,229
How are you brother Jeeva,
you look very different now.

295
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:39,403
You look very different brother.

296
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:43,267
All this clothes I bought it in discount.

297
00:46:46,436 --> 00:46:51,078
Brother just follow us without any problem.

298
00:47:23,574 --> 00:47:27,454
I've been patient for the past 3 years,
but no longer.

299
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:43,463
This is the place where you run your home.

300
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:49,110
The ones whom are shaving there now
is my people.

301
00:47:55,038 --> 00:48:02,217
Knife! Can you see where is it placed.
I can slaughter all of them.

302
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:04,684
Do you want to see it?

303
00:48:07,251 --> 00:48:08,594
1 minute.

304
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:11,624
What do you want?

305
00:48:18,996 --> 00:48:24,742
For the ﬁrst time Jeeva is asking
me what I need.

306
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:37,985
I want the 1O people's signature and also
drop the court case by telling the lawyer.

307
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:43,527
I will give you 2.5 million and
you must not be in India.

308
00:48:44,154 --> 00:48:48,398
2.5 million !!

309
00:48:49,159 --> 00:48:50,229
In rupees.

310
00:48:51,295 --> 00:48:56,335
When can I get the money.

311
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:00,980
Ones you get done the
documents and sign on it.

312
00:49:05,008 --> 00:49:09,252
I will sign and withdraw the case.

313
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:25,972
There is 500000 here and ones everything
is done balance 2 million you will get.

314
00:49:35,205 --> 00:49:36,741
Next time don't send people to the home.

315
00:49:37,407 --> 00:49:41,583
Mainly using the old people and threatening,
please don't do that.

316
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:50,125
Because if anything happens to them
no one can stop me from killing you.

317
00:49:51,455 --> 00:49:54,061
I'm leaving.

318
00:50:25,589 --> 00:50:27,125
I'm Jeeva here!

319
00:50:27,257 --> 00:50:33,105
Jeeva, all the vegetables you ordered in the
morning has arrived only the onions are not here yet.

320
00:50:49,579 --> 00:50:52,617
Hey what had happen?

321
00:51:01,625 --> 00:51:03,298
Such a warm day right?

322
00:51:03,794 --> 00:51:06,741
ls it government papers.
How did you get so much money?

323
00:51:15,639 --> 00:51:20,418
They brought you as they wanted to kill
you but give you so much in return.What did you do.

324
00:51:21,044 --> 00:51:27,256
Here after only I'm going to do.
Withdraw a case and some signatures.

325
00:51:27,384 --> 00:51:28,522
This is just advance.

326
00:51:29,219 --> 00:51:33,133
Ones everything is done balance 2 million.

327
00:51:33,223 --> 00:51:39,469
Kathiri if they are offering this much it must be something crucial.
Pity the old people, let's just run away with this money.

328
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:42,007
Hey I am not a fraud like you.

329
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:45,811
Then they caught 24 times for
ﬁghting for the country is it?

330
00:51:46,570 --> 00:51:56,150
No worries I will divide a sum for all of
the oldies and send them back to their village.

331
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:58,054
This is not our job...

332
00:52:05,455 --> 00:52:08,595
Jeeva we are waiting for you,
come faster.

333
00:52:09,059 --> 00:52:09,969

00:52:10,093 --> 00:52:13,666
Today is 4th August and you

336
00:52:18,101 --> 00:52:21,207

337
00:52:22,539 --> 00:52:28,114

00:52:57,774 --> 00:52:59,720
Good Day.

343
00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:01,311
Good evening to all of you.

344
00:53:02,045 --> 00:53:08,360
There will be some here don't know about
Mr. Jeeva, lets watch a short video about him.

345
00:53:11,721 --> 00:53:16,721
This is Jeeva's village. He is 37 years old,
studied for msc hydrology.

346
00:53:27,003 --> 00:53:33,784
My name is Sadayan, I've married to a girl from
Jeeva's village and there is where I first meet Jeeva.

347
00:53:36,012 --> 00:53:40,154
It is your choice to not to sell your village
land which can be used for the growth of paady.

348
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:49,095
But whatever land given us for marrying your village
girl is up to us to sell, but our wives are not willing to!

349
00:53:49,492 --> 00:53:58,276
The big ﬁsh as it is had destroyed most of the lands around.
Since we are not selling the lands they have provoked you.

350
00:53:58,768 --> 00:54:06,983
This was a big paddy plantation

351
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:12,110
There is very big water dam under this land, I have studied, and
onces I aware we can supply water to other village to grow paddy.

352
00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:22,265
You have been telling this
for the past 6 months.

353
00:54:22,792 --> 00:54:26,399
Be patient, I am Jeeva's college professor.

354
00:54:26,796 --> 00:54:28,036
These are his college mates.

355
00:54:28,465 --> 00:54:29,239
Give me that.

356
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:35,000
This is your village satellite view and the picture
in white is all water ﬂow under your village.

357
00:54:42,412 --> 00:54:46,155
Knowing on this the big ﬁsh wants
to buy the land somehow.

358
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:51,122
How if there is no water in the end
and no one wants to buy the land?

359
00:54:51,354 --> 00:54:55,996
If you give us a bit of time,
I will ﬁnd the spot.

360
00:54:56,226 --> 00:55:02,040
Take your time but till than let
our wives stay with their mum ﬁrst.

361
00:55:04,034 --> 00:55:07,948
ls either you bring us water or send our
wives back to us with agreeing to sell the land.

362
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:12,981
Wife screaming to husband not to go.

363
00:55:24,187 --> 00:55:27,134
Enough mum, the water is hot enough.

364
00:55:34,564 --> 00:55:37,101
Put it a bit further.

365
00:55:41,071 --> 00:55:42,982
Bro, coffee.

366
00:55:43,073 --> 00:55:45,519
Put it there sis.

367
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:52,217
What does this book means.

368
00:55:59,622 --> 00:56:06,164
It means that something that we eat after
we are done eating is actually somebody else's.

369
00:57:22,038 --> 00:57:25,247
We must ﬁnd out to which
way the water is ﬂowing.

370
00:57:26,009 --> 00:57:28,580
Bhai whose land is this?

371
00:57:32,148 --> 00:57:33,126
It's Marimuthu's.

372
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:40,025
Hey! Someone is chasing Marimuthu.

373
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:44,598
How about this land?

374
00:57:46,529 --> 00:57:47,564
It's Kamaruddin Bhai‘s.

375
00:57:56,639 --> 00:57:59,119
This place?

376
00:58:00,210 --> 00:58:01,348
It's Shanmugam‘s.

377
00:58:15,525 --> 00:58:16,401
How about this?

378
00:58:19,295 --> 00:58:20,399
Achappan's.

379
00:58:33,076 --> 00:58:35,955
Jeeva, someone had killed Marimuthu!

380
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:54,667
Who are you guys, this is our land.
Ask them to stop the digging.

381
00:59:55,058 --> 00:59:56,662
This land is been registered 3 months back.

382
00:59:57,060 --> 00:59:57,663
3 months back?

383
01:00:26,022 --> 01:00:29,162
This is just the photocopy,
you all can have it.

384
01:00:42,171 --> 01:00:43,343
Jeeva !!

385
01:02:20,002 --> 01:02:23,506
Your professor and the 2 mates
of yours are actually their people.

386
01:02:24,073 --> 01:02:25,984
They have backstabed us!

387
01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:39,050
Mum! They have cheated us !!

388
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:09,525
Hey! What is the problem here?!

389
01:03:10,286 --> 01:03:14,632
We are from Jeeva's village and we
would like to see the district head officer.

390
01:03:15,024 --> 01:03:20,269
What is so special there till you
all do not want to sell the lands it seems?

391
01:03:20,997 --> 01:03:23,068
That is our land to grow paddy sir.

392
01:03:30,039 --> 01:03:34,454
Who are you, real estate agent whom is
trying to increase the price of the land is it.

393
01:03:35,111 --> 01:03:42,791
No, but there is a water source below our
land and it can support 2 districts.

394
01:03:43,686 --> 01:03:51,070
I will get for 3 times of the current price
and 10% for me. What do you say, deal.

395
01:03:52,361 --> 01:03:54,534
Looks like you are the real estate agent.

396
01:04:04,373 --> 01:04:05,511
ls it your land?

397
01:04:07,443 --> 01:04:09,286

398
01:04:13,115 --> 01:04:16,653
ls it their wives are your relations?

399
01:04:21,424 --> 01:04:23,028
I'm their brother.

400
01:04:23,593 --> 01:04:33,537
How come different cast and religion are your sisters.
Any mistakes from your grandparents?

401
01:04:38,007 --> 01:04:43,007
Sir, for the past 8 years childrens and all are
suffering without food. Please don't disgrace us.

402
01:04:51,687 --> 01:04:54,793
No one should be here,
everyone go from here !!

403
01:04:55,157 --> 01:05:00,004
We must meet the higher authorities and ask them to write
in the report that there was ink on the victims thumb.

404
01:05:00,296 --> 01:05:03,004
We must arrest who are at the back of this.

405
01:05:03,232 --> 01:05:06,736
Are you trying to teach me x2!!

406
01:05:23,052 --> 01:05:24,759
No one should listen to him!

407
01:05:25,288 --> 01:05:27,199
I will ask them to give you all
a good rate for your land!

408
01:05:28,124 --> 01:05:31,037
We can never go against the big ﬁsh!

411
01:06:05,394 --> 01:06:06,532
Wait, wait, wait.

412
01:06:07,530 --> 01:06:13,173
I've heard everything, write a complaint and I will
investigate on this since I have a meeting to attend now.

413
01:06:16,405 --> 01:06:19,079
Jeeva have found water
source in his village.

414
01:06:19,375 --> 01:06:23,050
The big company wants to take this place and this
has became an issue and police arrested Jeeva.

415
01:06:23,145 --> 01:06:30,620
The villagers believe that is caused by
the big company. I'm reporter Senthil Kumar.

416
01:06:31,253 --> 01:06:32,061
Stop camera.

417
01:06:32,254 --> 01:06:36,168
Ones this is out in the news this
evening than you all see what happens.

418
01:06:39,028 --> 01:06:40,098
Hello Daily News channel.

419
01:06:40,229 --> 01:06:42,300
Hello, I am from Jeeva's village.

420
01:06:46,635 --> 01:06:48,046
Is there any fighting's going on.

421
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:51,583
There is no such issue but
the cops had brought Jeeva.

422
01:06:52,742 --> 01:06:55,120
Hmmm, than we will send the
reporters tomorrow morning.

423
01:06:55,244 --> 01:06:56,723
Tomorrow morning!

424
01:06:58,114 --> 01:07:08,092
If there is anything else much
interesting than this let us know.

425
01:07:08,724 --> 01:07:13,935
If Jeeva is murdered in the lock up,
than please do call us ﬁrst.

426
01:07:16,766 --> 01:07:18,143
What happened?

427
01:07:19,201 --> 01:07:21,181
Did you pass the news yet?

428
01:07:21,670 --> 01:07:28,315
I've already gave than an than, but they
said will only telecast in another 3 days.

429
01:07:34,750 --> 01:07:37,094
Let's go see my son.

430
01:07:50,199 --> 01:07:52,702
Let us in!

431
01:08:36,178 --> 01:08:40,718
Don't give up even if I die!

432
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:35,244
There is only one way to
safe Jeeva and also the land.

433
01:09:35,604 --> 01:09:40,604
The only way to let the world know on
what is happening <i>is...</i>

434
01:09:53,589 --> 01:10:00,063
The 6 of them decided to
suicide at a time by cutting their necks.

435
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:09,377
I am the reporter whom
recorded the whole of it.

436
01:10:13,042 --> 01:10:18,993
Please listen to me and lets think
of something else. I beg you all.

437
01:10:27,156 --> 01:10:32,606
We do not have any other choice than this.

438
01:10:34,163 --> 01:10:42,378
Suicide is against my religion but what is happening
here is worse than that so I do not have any other way.

439
01:10:42,771 --> 01:10:49,416
We want justice and we believe that
this is going to make a big difference.

440
01:10:49,812 --> 01:10:59,529
Our blood will be in this water and if there is a factory built on 
top of this then you all will be drinking the poor farmers blood.

441
01:11:36,558 --> 01:11:44,033
The suspect whom is behind this
will be investigated on this.

442
01:11:48,337 --> 01:11:57,746
The villagers got back the land and
were asked to do the water work by Jeeva.

443
01:11:58,647 --> 01:12:06,998
To get money support the men
from the village go far to do labor job.

444
01:12:17,299 --> 01:12:26,708
All the ladies are still waiting for
them to come back to the village.

445
01:12:28,410 --> 01:12:34,190
Jeeva with 10 other men from the
village stayed in mother Theresa home

446
01:12:34,583 --> 01:12:41,023
It has been 3 years and all the men are
still working hard in many different places.

447
01:12:41,423 --> 01:12:45,166
This are the people who are
still working till Jeeva wins the case.

448
01:12:48,263 --> 01:12:58,048
Brother Jeeva, how are you,
please win the case and we all can go back.

449
01:13:01,009 --> 01:13:06,009
Hi brother Jeeva, I'm working in the wine
shop and can't wait to come back ones we win.

450
01:13:16,058 --> 01:13:21,058
Hi brother Jeeva, I'm working as a toilet cleaner and
please win the case so that we can prove to all of them.

451
01:13:30,172 --> 01:13:33,984
Now we are going to give Jeeva 400000.

452
01:13:34,209 --> 01:13:39,209
This is not by the club but we collected it from
all the workers from the village and giving it to Jeeva.

453
01:13:44,787 --> 01:13:51,033
Now we call upon stage Mr. Jeeva.

454
01:14:24,193 --> 01:14:28,642
2400 is worth of coins.

455
01:14:45,047 --> 01:14:49,757
Ravi you wait here,
I will return back his money.

456
01:14:57,159 --> 01:14:58,797
What happened.

457
01:15:06,969 --> 01:15:11,076
I feel ashamed and
I should not be here anymore.

458
01:15:12,241 --> 01:15:13,549
I must go in and he must be here.

459
01:15:16,979 --> 01:15:20,256
You drop me and you can leave.

460
01:15:37,766 --> 01:15:39,006
What happened.

461
01:15:39,134 --> 01:15:40,010
Nothing.

462
01:15:41,236 --> 01:15:42,476
What happened.

463
01:15:44,439 --> 01:15:53,052
Since you do not agree to sign they have
wacked all the old folks and they are still there.

464
01:15:53,615 --> 01:15:55,595
They beat them?

465
01:15:56,385 --> 01:15:58,422
Turn the vehicle.

466
01:16:24,479 --> 01:16:25,981
They hit all of us.

467
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:30,321
They hit me Jeeva.

468
01:16:32,287 --> 01:16:33,664
Did anyone call the doctor.

469
01:16:34,022 --> 01:16:34,659
They broke my arm.

470
01:16:35,023 --> 01:16:36,001
Did you call the ambulance?

471
01:16:36,158 --> 01:16:37,432
They did not allow us.

472
01:16:38,093 --> 01:16:40,073
Come lets go to the hospital.

473
01:18:54,396 --> 01:18:55,704
Shall we go?

474
01:18:57,065 --> 01:18:58,442
Bring in the luggage.

475
01:19:00,068 --> 01:19:02,378
Bring in the luggage!

476
01:19:05,941 --> 01:19:07,943
Here after I am Jeeva!

477
01:19:09,010 --> 01:19:13,459
Let him be in till this case is over.

478
01:19:19,087 --> 01:19:20,725
I heard that you hit my people.

479
01:19:22,557 --> 01:19:24,434
The village will be mine.

480
01:19:26,094 --> 01:19:29,940
Your village will be
my factory workers toilet.

481
01:19:31,433 --> 01:19:38,043
If you want to be alive, run
or else I will chop you to pieces.

482
01:20:04,466 --> 01:20:05,376
What is happening here?

483
01:20:06,001 --> 01:20:08,106
I am checking out a article
related to this case.

484
01:20:09,404 --> 01:20:11,111
You know something?

485
01:20:11,306 --> 01:20:17,257
There is overseas company taking 500000
liters of water a day from a village like this.

486
01:20:17,412 --> 01:20:22,054
Looks like you will be an
expert before the case ends.

487
01:20:26,488 --> 01:20:27,728
I need to talk to you personally.

488
01:20:28,190 --> 01:20:28,998
Ok, I will make a move.

489
01:20:29,157 --> 01:20:33,401
I mean the both of you.

490
01:20:34,796 --> 01:20:35,740
Tell us.

491
01:20:37,132 --> 01:20:39,043
I don't know how to say it.

492
01:20:50,412 --> 01:20:56,522
This is the ﬁrst time in this world someone
would have came across something like this.

493
01:20:56,785 --> 01:20:58,264
Ok but why I was called as well.

494
01:20:58,620 --> 01:20:59,758
Just for company.

495
01:21:00,121 --> 01:21:03,034
For company, ok since
you have said I will go ﬁrst.

496
01:21:05,060 --> 01:21:06,095
Wait!

497
01:21:07,062 --> 01:21:16,039
Me to since the day
I saw her I love her.

498
01:21:16,371 --> 01:21:21,371
But me not since I see you but after knowing
how good person you are I decide to marry you.

499
01:21:27,816 --> 01:21:32,356
Oh, if that is the case correct
which is you love him, Not you friend.

500
01:21:33,154 --> 01:21:34,098
What is he saying?

501
01:21:35,257 --> 01:21:38,466
He becomes a bit mad
if he is very happy.

502
01:21:38,727 --> 01:21:39,398
Yes.

503
01:21:43,164 --> 01:21:44,268
I need to bring you to a place?

504
01:21:44,666 --> 01:21:45,371
Let's go.

505
01:26:46,167 --> 01:26:47,771
I give you 3 minutes.

506
01:26:54,642 --> 01:26:59,057
Who are you, the jailer claims that it
is not you, how you are here.

507
01:27:02,350 --> 01:27:04,990
I meet with an accident 2 days back.

508
01:27:05,420 --> 01:27:09,596
The person whom
saved me was just like me.

509
01:27:15,196 --> 01:27:19,508
I need to kill him, I will send my people.
Just name me your place.

510
01:27:21,135 --> 01:27:30,351
No. If you kill him than there won't be any prove that I am not him.
I have to be in the prison for good than.

511
01:27:32,013 --> 01:27:33,083
I will get you out of here.

512
01:27:34,048 --> 01:27:35,550
I cannot make it with my injured leg.

513
01:27:36,351 --> 01:27:38,024
I will send <i>2</i> of my people with you.

514
01:27:38,152 --> 01:27:40,689
You have to follow them
and just show them him.

515
01:27:42,223 --> 01:27:45,295
Ones you are out is easy
to prove who you are.

516
01:27:54,035 --> 01:27:57,039
Coming 15th is going to be the
case judgment day.

517
01:27:58,640 --> 01:28:01,678
I did not expect Jeeva
to give us back the money.

518
01:28:03,144 --> 01:28:06,057
Infect I did not expect him
to take it in the ﬁrst place.

519
01:28:07,115 --> 01:28:14,499
Surprisingly he is beating back.
Something is ﬁshy.

520
01:28:15,290 --> 01:28:17,998
Only this one village is giving
us a lot of trouble.

521
01:28:18,159 --> 01:28:21,971
In another 3 days judgment
will be on our side.

522
01:28:22,997 --> 01:28:30,472
If the report by Mr. Laksmi is on our side
than it's ﬁne, but I heard he is very strict.

523
01:28:38,746 --> 01:28:42,057
Same goes to humans.

524
01:28:57,131 --> 01:28:58,732
What is the issue here!

525
01:28:58,733 --> 01:29:05,309
Sir regards to our case we believe that
what report is given by you will be thejudgment.

526
01:29:05,540 --> 01:29:08,419
We hope that we will get the
justice since that is the truth.

527
01:29:09,077 --> 01:29:14,254
It is wrong to meet and speak to me such
a way. Please go immediately.

528
01:29:19,387 --> 01:29:22,163
1 minute.

529
01:29:22,990 --> 01:29:27,598
Please wait for me over there.

530
01:29:29,263 --> 01:29:30,970
You all too.

531
01:29:32,433 --> 01:29:37,974
Sir I know that you've been bought over.

532
01:29:38,373 --> 01:29:41,217
I believe that you know
which is right as well.

533
01:29:45,413 --> 01:29:52,160
If anything goes wrong,
I will assign a 17 year old boy to kill you.

534
01:29:56,057 --> 01:29:57,468
Just 3 years jail.

535
01:29:58,793 --> 01:30:03,242
Besides that I can also ask
them to hit and run by the car.

536
01:30:07,001 --> 01:30:09,174
Just have to pay ﬁne only.

537
01:30:09,771 --> 01:30:13,651
Or else I will just poke you
with a rusted knife.

538
01:30:15,009 --> 01:30:16,716
Do you know why I choose it to be rusted?

539
01:30:18,045 --> 01:30:25,054
Than only you will die after 8 months.

540
01:30:28,623 --> 01:30:32,070
The choice is yours.

541
01:30:38,032 --> 01:30:39,375
Did he scare you!

542
01:30:40,101 --> 01:30:44,106
The way he mentioned it was very strong.

543
01:30:44,405 --> 01:30:45,475
Infect the law also he knows.

544
01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:49,383
There is no way that we
can kill someone as he said.

545
01:30:56,818 --> 01:31:00,129
Don't worry I am here for you.

546
01:31:00,421 --> 01:31:01,991
Infect I am going because
you are in the back of me.

547
01:31:08,062 --> 01:31:11,009
Looks like you're scared till
you have gone back to him again.

548
01:31:12,166 --> 01:31:15,045
Look! You don't know about him!

549
01:31:16,804 --> 01:31:22,413
There is someone outside his door
to meet you, ask him to have a look.

550
01:31:22,777 --> 01:31:26,748
Sir there is someone out the
door to meet you it seems.

551
01:31:34,021 --> 01:31:35,796
They sent me to shave for you.

552
01:31:39,694 --> 01:31:43,574
Just minutes ago someone from your
saloon shaved for me and when.

553
01:31:43,831 --> 01:31:45,367
No sir I am the one.

554
01:31:45,633 --> 01:31:47,112
Than who was that?

555
01:31:55,576 --> 01:31:57,715
Put me on loud speaker.

556
01:32:00,047 --> 01:32:03,517
Hey Shirak,
ask someone to check your neck at the back.

557
01:32:09,457 --> 01:32:10,697
There is a thumb print.

558
01:32:13,594 --> 01:32:20,569
It won't take long for me to change the assignment
to chop your head instead of just a cop with ink.

559
01:32:22,503 --> 01:32:28,010
Remember you shaved for
the oldies previously, how is this.

560
01:32:28,442 --> 01:32:33,414
For me is always easy for
me to do than just saying it.

561
01:32:34,515 --> 01:32:41,091
Mr. Laksmi, you should
understand that he cannot safe you right.

562
01:32:47,662 --> 01:32:54,011
I thought this was a small case
but you are not in the safe zone as well.

563
01:32:55,469 --> 01:32:56,709
Your money.

564
01:32:58,139 --> 01:33:01,086
You may count it and please leave me.

565
01:33:07,582 --> 01:33:10,085
How dare he did this to me.

566
01:33:11,586 --> 01:33:13,065
What can he do if I send 1O people of mine.

567
01:33:13,254 --> 01:33:14,358
He will surely handle it sir.

568
01:33:16,223 --> 01:33:17,167
20 people.

569
01:33:17,558 --> 01:33:18,559
He will get wacked.

570
01:33:20,294 --> 01:33:21,170
How about 40.

571
01:33:21,529 --> 01:33:23,600
They will make him to pieces.

572
01:33:26,033 --> 01:33:28,104
Send 50 of them.

573
01:33:29,303 --> 01:33:33,308
Ask them to chop him to small pieces.

574
01:34:04,739 --> 01:34:08,414
Don't use bus or train and also often change
vehicles time to time. Late also nevermind.

575
01:34:09,110 --> 01:34:12,683
As soon as he shows the person,
Kill straight away.

576
01:34:29,764 --> 01:34:33,075
Hey it is 1.30 a.m.
You have not slept yet.

577
01:34:34,168 --> 01:34:36,114
lam just going through the
history of the case.

578
01:34:36,303 --> 01:34:39,750
For sure we will win since
you have scare Mr. Laksmi.

579
01:34:40,074 --> 01:34:45,319
There is another 2 days only and
he should not do anything wrong.

580
01:35:06,367 --> 01:35:07,505
Let me call the cops.

581
01:35:08,269 --> 01:35:10,749
There are 40 to 50 of them.

582
01:35:33,327 --> 01:35:38,072
Listen, you lock the room doors
and also switch of the power supply.

583
01:35:39,533 --> 01:35:46,314
When I drop the coin, you on back
the power for a sec and off back.

584
01:35:46,574 --> 01:35:52,422
Do the same each time I drop a coin.

585
01:35:52,580 --> 01:35:56,118
When I drop all the coins,
on back the supply for good.

586
01:38:19,026 --> 01:38:21,506
Within 10 minutes the whole
crowd must be in the lorry.

587
01:38:21,996 --> 01:38:25,034
Most important it
should be out of this area.

588
01:38:40,114 --> 01:38:43,152
What happened son?

589
01:38:44,351 --> 01:38:48,731
Don't worry just go back to bed.

590
01:39:07,675 --> 01:39:16,288
According to the investigation, the
water supply should be used for agriculture.

591
01:39:17,685 --> 01:39:22,327
But today morning there is petition submitted saying,
people around the district wants factory to be build there.

592
01:39:23,090 --> 01:39:28,090
Over 2000 graduates had voted
on this in the district.

593
01:39:37,738 --> 01:39:45,281
This don't make sense since it's last minute and what
prove do we have that the voters are from the district.

594
01:39:45,546 --> 01:39:49,619
They have attached the prove
as well that they are from the district.

595
01:39:51,585 --> 01:39:57,501
We do give importance
since they are graduates.

596
01:39:59,093 --> 01:40:02,404
They have to prove that they
are related to the district.

597
01:40:02,696 --> 01:40:05,233
They have submitted
all the relevant documents.

598
01:40:05,666 --> 01:40:08,010
If you think it's fake,
you got to prove it.

599
01:40:10,270 --> 01:40:13,172
Give us a bit time to prove it.

600
01:40:13,173 --> 01:40:15,016
We need one copy of all of it.

601
01:40:16,076 --> 01:40:18,078
We are unable to postpone this further.

602
01:40:18,379 --> 01:40:25,991
Final decision will be in another 5 days.
If nothing is proven you might lose the case.

603
01:40:43,504 --> 01:40:47,042
There is a new problem in this case,
that's taking some time.

604
01:40:54,481 --> 01:40:59,430
All the documents are original.

605
01:41:00,054 --> 01:41:01,192
<i>ls it.</i>

606
01:41:01,588 --> 01:41:07,334
I have checked it all but
none of them are in India now.

607
01:41:07,728 --> 01:41:10,402
They are based overseas doing labor job.

608
01:41:10,697 --> 01:41:13,200
Why did they select them than.

609
01:41:14,168 --> 01:41:16,079
Do you have their companies contact number.

610
01:41:16,270 --> 01:41:20,377
I am collecting it but for now
I have 50 of their company number.

611
01:41:20,574 --> 01:41:23,077
Please talk to them,
I doubt something is wrong.

612
01:41:34,755 --> 01:41:36,701
Hi I am calling from Chennai.

613
01:41:37,391 --> 01:41:39,769
My name is Jeeva.

614
01:41:40,594 --> 01:41:41,698
You mean Brother Jeeva.

615
01:41:42,329 --> 01:41:49,679
Yes, and looks like you have supported that in our
village that the factory must be build. ls that true.

616
01:41:50,104 --> 01:41:52,106
Is it, but I did not do so.

617
01:41:52,406 --> 01:41:55,819
But your relevant documents
all submitted for this.

618
01:41:56,210 --> 01:42:03,287
No brother, I'm picking up rubbish here and waiting
when can I come back to do agriculture again.

619
01:42:04,384 --> 01:42:06,625
Can you come to Chennai and
tell this at the court.

620
01:42:07,020 --> 01:42:10,968
I came under 4 years contract,
our passport is with the boss.

621
01:42:11,225 --> 01:42:13,000
lam driving Taxi.

622
01:42:13,227 --> 01:42:14,604
ls your passport with you.

623
01:42:15,129 --> 01:42:16,335
Passport is with them.

624
01:42:30,744 --> 01:42:37,286
Looks like they have planned well
and made things difﬁcult now.

625
01:42:38,118 --> 01:42:43,033
Looks like we don't have
any other way to prove it.

626
01:42:43,657 --> 01:42:50,267
We will lose and they will win.

627
01:42:55,302 --> 01:43:00,411
Trying to win a big company
using your local lawyer.

628
01:43:02,142 --> 01:43:05,521
I have an advocate team with me.

629
01:43:06,246 --> 01:43:11,246
None of the ones in the list of prove
will come. Understand.

630
01:43:19,726 --> 01:43:28,305
My corperate company is very big and your
village is like a mosquito stuck on the spider web.

631
01:43:36,210 --> 01:43:40,090
If a corperate company is facing problem,
only the related companies will join together.

632
01:43:41,114 --> 01:43:46,120
Lets prove them that farmer's like us whom
face problem the whole of India will come for us.

633
01:43:46,420 --> 01:43:48,093
Everyone should know our problem.

634
01:43:49,122 --> 01:43:51,068
For that we need the media support.

635
01:43:51,425 --> 01:43:57,137
Surely we will put the news but
not as you request in the front page.

636
01:43:57,431 --> 01:44:01,243
Maybe a small column
at 6th of 7th page.

637
01:44:03,103 --> 01:44:10,146
There are much more hot news
and yours is 3 years back old news.

638
01:44:11,311 --> 01:44:15,350
Yes, we can do it this way.

639
01:44:15,549 --> 01:44:21,090
Make sure bring down all the ladies and kids
whom are affected so that it will look more real.

640
01:44:21,288 --> 01:44:28,638
Everyone should cry shout in emotions
and no one should stop them.

641
01:44:29,162 --> 01:44:33,008
Later on we can edit with effects
and broadcast it the following Sunday.

642
01:44:34,201 --> 01:44:36,044
The case will end in another 5 days sir.

643
01:44:36,203 --> 01:44:40,174
There won't be any slot as immediate as
you request. Are you out of your mind.

644
01:44:53,553 --> 01:44:58,059
They have created fake evidence and
we can't prove it since it's done tactically.

645
01:44:58,458 --> 01:45:01,928
We can only win if the citizens
support us from all over.

646
01:45:03,130 --> 01:45:06,475
Sir I understand your situation,
but there is no value in your news.

647
01:45:07,067 --> 01:45:14,246
For example somebody commit suicide is a different value
and somebody has committed suicide has a different value.

648
01:45:14,508 --> 01:45:23,622
There is no value in this news
and no media will take this news.

649
01:45:25,319 --> 01:45:28,960
This is a village problem, why don't you
settle it there, why bring it here!

650
01:45:41,101 --> 01:45:45,140
Hi we are calling from Jeeva's village.
ls there anyone there that I can speak to.

651
01:45:45,505 --> 01:45:47,007
Hold on please.

652
01:45:51,211 --> 01:45:52,588
Call from your village.

653
01:45:55,115 --> 01:45:56,287
Grandpa, how are you.

654
01:45:56,616 --> 01:45:57,560
Ok.

655
01:45:57,751 --> 01:45:59,662
Why is the case postponed 5 days more?

656
01:46:00,220 --> 01:46:03,064
Everyone is worried over here.

657
01:46:03,323 --> 01:46:03,926
Don't worry child.

658
01:46:04,524 --> 01:46:08,336
Ok mum wants to speak to brother.

659
01:46:13,166 --> 01:46:14,338
Your mother wants to speak.

660
01:46:23,076 --> 01:46:24,111
<i>Son.</i>

661
01:46:25,178 --> 01:46:26,088
Mum.

662
01:46:26,646 --> 01:46:30,355
Don't worry everything should be ﬁne.

663
01:46:30,717 --> 01:46:33,095
We are all praying hard as well.

664
01:46:34,588 --> 01:46:35,498
Ok mum.

665
01:46:36,123 --> 01:46:38,399
Just wait neighbour Kogila
wants to speak to you.

666
01:46:39,593 --> 01:46:40,128
Pass the line mum.

667
01:46:42,396 --> 01:46:44,569
Brother are you ﬁne.

668
01:46:46,032 --> 01:46:47,010
I am ok.

669
01:46:47,334 --> 01:46:49,507
Last week my dad passed away in Dubai.

670
01:46:50,036 --> 01:46:52,676
He had some heart failure.

671
01:46:53,407 --> 01:46:54,750
They said will send back the body.

672
01:46:55,142 --> 01:47:00,592
But till the case is over no men should come in right,
so we ask them to settle everything there itself.

673
01:47:00,947 --> 01:47:05,089
Ok I will hang up ﬁrst brother.

674
01:47:24,104 --> 01:47:25,048
<i>Son.</i>

675
01:47:27,574 --> 01:47:37,120
Shall the 5 of us commit suicide for
the media pay attention to us.

676
01:47:40,053 --> 01:47:45,053
Most to most 5 or 6 years more we will
be alive, so this will be a good idea right.

677
01:48:06,046 --> 01:48:10,358
ls it they will only look at us if we die?

678
01:48:12,018 --> 01:48:15,363
They will not help any farmers
before they die is it?

679
01:48:25,031 --> 01:48:28,240
If we hit a small business guy also all related
people will come together and ask their rights.

680
01:48:29,569 --> 01:48:31,947
Same goes to the loan sharks.

681
01:48:32,239 --> 01:48:36,949
But when it comes to farmers,
this is the case right.

682
01:48:39,079 --> 01:48:47,157
Every rice and other stuffs they want
it from the village but not the farmers is it.

683
01:48:47,654 --> 01:48:51,466
In city all they need a pipe for water, so they won't
know what are we facing for water to agriculture.

684
01:48:51,625 --> 01:48:53,036
Let us teach them all!

685
01:48:53,627 --> 01:48:58,007
Let us teach them whom depend on pipe 24 hours
on what are we facing in the village as farmers.

686
01:49:01,034 --> 01:49:03,640
The next 3 days there wont
be water supply in the whole of Chennai.

687
01:49:04,638 --> 01:49:07,016
All of them should only think of water.

688
01:49:07,974 --> 01:49:11,012
Look how the media will come now to us.

689
01:49:11,578 --> 01:49:13,023
How is it possible?

690
01:49:16,583 --> 01:49:18,927
Get me Chennai City blueprint.

691
01:49:52,752 --> 01:50:00,136
Water supply to Chennai is
70% by dam 20% by lorry and <i>10%</i> by earth.

692
01:50:00,727 --> 01:50:04,300
We are only going to block
the 70% which is by pipe.

693
01:50:04,431 --> 01:50:12,509
When this 70% comes to take water from the lorry
supply second day itself the water will not be enough.

694
01:50:12,806 --> 01:50:16,549
The 3rd day water will be the main issue.

695
01:50:16,743 --> 01:50:19,485
It is not for the citizens to suffer.

696
01:50:20,013 --> 01:50:25,486
We want them to know what are we facing and
the media should turn back and look at us. That all.

697
01:50:25,785 --> 01:50:28,129
How many dam's are in this 70%.

698
01:50:28,254 --> 01:50:32,124
About 5 of it.

699
01:50:32,125 --> 01:50:35,629
How are we going to stop the water?

700
01:50:39,265 --> 01:50:41,074
Who is going to do it?

701
01:50:42,035 --> 01:50:43,036
You and me.

702
01:50:43,236 --> 01:50:47,446
Us? What can we do at this age.

703
01:50:47,807 --> 01:50:52,586
Since we are useless that's why our
own childrens had leave us behind here.

704
01:50:52,846 --> 01:50:54,018
It doesn't matter if your old.

705
01:50:55,315 --> 01:50:58,558
Many achieved when they were old.

706
01:51:00,053 --> 01:51:09,098
For example Mother Theresa
and Mahatma Gandhi.

707
01:51:10,563 --> 01:51:15,034
Age do not matters but
it's all in our heart.

708
01:51:17,604 --> 01:51:22,781
Lets prove to all your family
members whom threw you all away.

709
01:51:23,810 --> 01:51:25,517
Whose coming with me?

710
01:51:36,656 --> 01:51:42,072
Ask any of your brave and
trustworthy friends to come as well.

711
01:51:42,562 --> 01:51:44,098
We need another 60 people.

712
01:52:22,702 --> 01:52:27,014
We have to on the motor by 5 a.m.
We are already late 1 hour.

713
01:52:33,480 --> 01:52:35,357
Hey! Get down.

714
01:52:54,801 --> 01:52:57,714
Make sure the pipe is fully showed.

715
01:53:00,473 --> 01:53:04,080
Angita you make a move to the other dam.
Everyone else will be waiting there.

716
01:53:04,544 --> 01:53:05,113
OK.

717
01:53:06,479 --> 01:53:09,119
Ravi you go to the east dam.

718
01:53:09,349 --> 01:53:10,225
OK

719
01:53:16,089 --> 01:53:23,029
Grandpa later on hang the CD over here.

720
01:53:23,263 --> 01:53:25,470
The rest just follow me.

721
01:53:48,288 --> 01:53:51,098
How are we suppose to on
the water motor if they are inside it.

722
01:53:51,424 --> 01:53:53,131
We got to inform that area cops to go.

723
01:54:11,044 --> 01:54:17,325
Anybody there! ls anyone there!

724
01:54:46,246 --> 01:54:50,786
Hey! What are you all doing.
Come out or I will come in!

725
01:54:51,050 --> 01:54:59,731
Try coming in we will burn
the whole place including you.

726
01:55:06,032 --> 01:55:09,172
There are people in sir,
all of them are old people.

727
01:55:09,569 --> 01:55:11,708
They are scaring out saying
that they will burn themselves.

728
01:55:12,305 --> 01:55:17,482
We are suppose to send the water by Sam,
but now it's already 9am.

729
01:55:18,544 --> 01:55:28,090
Sir we have just got the news
that all 5 places also the same issue.

730
01:56:07,760 --> 01:56:12,760
We are trying to bypass by breaking the pipe in between
but they are walking where we are breaking from inside.

731
01:56:20,773 --> 01:56:26,018
Moreover everyone inside that has petrol with them,
it will be big issue if anything goes wrong with them.

732
01:56:26,179 --> 01:56:28,989
Jeeva from the village is doing everything.

733
01:56:29,182 --> 01:56:30,525
He is in there too.

734
01:56:31,050 --> 01:56:32,961
They will only listen to him.

735
01:56:34,253 --> 01:56:36,995
How all of a sudden villagers
can think so criminally.

736
01:56:42,795 --> 01:56:50,111
How is the situation there,
here full of press outside.

737
01:56:50,603 --> 01:56:55,603
We don't need media now,
we will answer ones the public question us.

738
01:58:01,240 --> 01:58:06,240
The villagers had stopped the water supply
of Chennai.This has become a big issue.

739
01:58:08,014 --> 01:58:15,023
These are the villagers.

740
01:58:20,626 --> 01:58:22,936
Mum is grandpa.

741
01:58:24,597 --> 01:58:27,077
Hey they are showing your dad.

742
01:58:27,533 --> 01:58:31,743
We are going to discuss
more on this after the break.

743
01:58:42,315 --> 01:58:43,953
Jeeva is listening to Hindi news.

744
01:58:44,584 --> 01:58:47,588
It is not Hindi but Bengali.

745
01:58:50,990 --> 01:58:51,730
Yes Angita.

746
01:58:52,592 --> 01:58:53,730
My grandpa is there right?

747
01:58:57,063 --> 01:58:57,564
Yes.

748
01:58:58,531 --> 01:59:00,010
Tell him I am on the phone.

749
01:59:02,435 --> 01:59:04,506
Uncle, Angita wants to speak.

750
01:59:04,937 --> 01:59:05,938
Here I come.

751
01:59:09,008 --> 01:59:12,012
She ask me to pass you this when she calls.

752
01:59:17,049 --> 01:59:18,392
Ring?

753
01:59:22,088 --> 01:59:23,032
It is for you.

754
01:59:31,364 --> 01:59:34,072
We are engaged now.

755
01:59:35,334 --> 01:59:43,549
Here after whenever I call your
phone must not be engage. OK.

756
01:59:45,378 --> 01:59:46,220
OK.

757
01:59:52,285 --> 01:59:57,234
It has been 1 day without water in Chennai.

758
02:00:51,210 --> 02:00:56,210
All the other states are supporting
Jeeva's village except Chennai.

759
02:01:05,124 --> 02:01:08,105
There is no water here for 20 years,
just <i>2</i> days and they are creating a big havoc.

760
02:01:08,361 --> 02:01:11,399
Don't we look like humans since
we don't have water supply also.

761
02:01:11,664 --> 02:01:14,076
lam here because my village got no water.

762
02:01:14,400 --> 02:01:19,440
Try listening to these people.

763
02:01:19,772 --> 02:01:29,591
It is wrong to compare village with city.
This is ridiculous.

764
02:01:42,228 --> 02:01:48,338
Did you listen to the radio, without any
move people seem to be supporting us.

765
02:01:50,169 --> 02:01:56,415
Everyone in the city is angry with us,
I am going to talk to the press tomorrow.

766
02:01:57,777 --> 02:02:00,951
After that they will know
what are we facing.

767
02:02:02,581 --> 02:02:09,191
Than we can go against Shirak in court.

768
02:02:11,457 --> 02:02:12,731
Just one problem.

769
02:02:13,025 --> 02:02:13,594
What?

770
02:02:14,327 --> 02:02:19,327
Jeeva has escaped from the jail and surely he is coming
here, If he gets us wrong everything will be wasted.

771
02:03:36,108 --> 02:03:41,251
There can be business competition with us
but if there is an interfere we should be together.

772
02:03:41,447 --> 02:03:47,056
We must settle this or else they
will dig all the pass and put on a case.

773
02:03:47,420 --> 02:03:52,062
I have a shampoo factory and it cost
45 eggs to make a big bottle of shampoo.

774
02:03:52,291 --> 02:03:57,104
If the poor kids out there wants
to eat eggs how would I make shampoo.

775
02:03:57,229 --> 02:04:02,303
So if he loses this case all
of us will be in trouble.

776
02:04:03,135 --> 02:04:05,581
There is 33 cases on my 12 companies.

777
02:04:06,605 --> 02:04:09,518
In future they will ask me
to drop the case as well.

778
02:04:11,110 --> 02:04:13,386
Press must no come into this.

779
02:04:15,981 --> 02:04:17,961
I have brought down 400 people.

780
02:04:18,517 --> 02:04:21,623
They will create a beef when Jeeva
is going to speak to the press and ﬁnish him.

781
02:04:31,997 --> 02:04:33,567
I will win this case.

782
02:05:33,592 --> 02:05:36,300
You mean to say a jailbird did all of this.

783
02:05:37,263 --> 02:05:43,509
You mean to say he
created this much of hassle.

784
02:05:56,048 --> 02:05:56,617
Did you see properly.

785
02:05:57,049 --> 02:06:00,553
Yes, it is Jeeva whom
going with the inspector.

786
02:06:01,487 --> 02:06:06,487
How he came out of the pipe and why inspector,
he must be planning something.

787
02:06:44,530 --> 02:06:46,032
Sir both of them are alive.

788
02:06:46,665 --> 02:06:50,374
Kill the inspector and bring Jeeva.

789
02:06:53,072 --> 02:06:54,016
Really!

790
02:06:54,139 --> 02:07:01,216
You don't believe me on your camera.

791
02:07:10,956 --> 02:07:12,435
Then I will send back the 400 people.

792
02:07:17,196 --> 02:07:20,336
Don't use any local
thugs for the time being.

793
02:07:20,766 --> 02:07:23,940
I will send you some guys for your safety.

794
02:07:32,678 --> 02:07:37,650
Today Jeeva will be talking to the press.

795
02:07:46,392 --> 02:07:49,032
You are suppose to be
interviewed today right.

796
02:07:50,729 --> 02:07:55,644
Look all of them are waiting,
talk something.

797
02:07:59,004 --> 02:08:01,041
Tomorrow I will win the case.

798
02:08:02,441 --> 02:08:06,947
You hit 50 of my people right,
try now!

799
02:08:08,447 --> 02:08:12,623
You threw away the money I gave you right,
look what happen now.

800
02:08:15,621 --> 02:08:22,004
You point back the knife at me when
I pointed it to the old folks. Try now.

801
02:08:24,496 --> 02:08:28,103
I should have kill you
in the beginning itself.

802
02:08:29,134 --> 02:08:34,413
Now you have open all the
other villagers eyes.

803
02:08:35,174 --> 02:08:39,680
You thought of saying to the press and
change the decision in the court right.

804
02:08:49,588 --> 02:08:52,262
You mean this old folks going to talk.

805
02:09:10,375 --> 02:09:11,285
2 Jeeva's?

806
02:09:53,152 --> 02:09:59,068
What you have done?

807
02:10:07,566 --> 02:10:10,137
Greetings to everyone.

808
02:10:12,771 --> 02:10:13,977
You can start questioning.

809
02:10:14,072 --> 02:10:18,714
What question? You are keeping this old
folks and making a big mistake.

810
02:10:19,077 --> 02:10:20,420
Old folks !!

811
02:10:22,181 --> 02:10:26,061
Come here sir, come, come.

812
02:10:31,089 --> 02:10:36,163
Looks like you are the
one whom mentioned old folks right.

813
02:10:37,196 --> 02:10:38,470
When was the last you planted a tree.

814
02:10:40,165 --> 02:10:47,743
2 years, 5 years or 1O years back.

815
02:10:47,840 --> 02:10:51,049
Yes I have money plant in my house.

816
02:10:56,181 --> 02:11:04,532
This old folks did not plant money plant
but plants that makes all of you live today.

817
02:11:06,458 --> 02:11:12,101
200 villages were destroyed by
the America Developers.

818
02:11:12,431 --> 02:11:15,537
This is the only village
whom had gone against them.

819
02:11:16,101 --> 02:11:20,982
They have sacriﬁced 9 people for this.

820
02:11:24,076 --> 02:11:27,990
We have tried our best to let
everyone know on this but cannot.

821
02:11:28,747 --> 02:11:34,220
Have you ever think of the
farmers each time you eat rice?

822
02:11:37,122 --> 02:11:42,122
7000 over farming lands and water supply is
been destroyed and stopped over the years.

823
02:11:56,074 --> 02:12:01,074
Where will the farmers go for water if the
Cola company is taking 9000 liter water per day.

824
02:12:07,152 --> 02:12:10,133
They are not bagging for food
but asking for water to do agriculture.

825
02:12:10,522 --> 02:12:14,732
Not only this farmers but all
the others whom ran away as well.

826
02:12:15,093 --> 02:12:21,738
Farmers whom were farming 20
years back are having bad life now.

827
02:12:27,673 --> 02:12:37,287
Every 30 minutes 1 farmer
is committing suicide in India.

828
02:12:38,150 --> 02:12:40,426
This is been happening
for the past 10 years.

829
02:12:41,119 --> 02:12:46,501
They were all alive just to give everyone
food but now getting lesser slow by slow.

830
02:12:51,129 --> 02:12:57,239
Over 100000 farmers of them
gone doing other jobs infect.

831
02:12:57,736 --> 02:13:02,736
Now the multinational company is trying to destroy
the balance land which can be used for farming.

832
02:13:13,018 --> 02:13:15,396
All the families are going
to die without food.

833
02:13:17,089 --> 02:13:22,089
A beer factory owner couldn't pay the
debt of 500 million but did not commit suicide.

834
02:13:32,304 --> 02:13:40,018
But a farmer whom just cannot pay
his debt of 500 commit suicide.

835
02:13:41,380 --> 02:13:44,418
You people in the city don't
have time for all this am I right?

836
02:13:44,783 --> 02:13:47,161
We wanted to tell this in
theTV and asked a chance.

837
02:13:47,686 --> 02:13:56,003
They said that they don't have time
for all this since it is not a interesting topic.

838
02:14:01,033 --> 02:14:06,033
We are not saying we don't want factories but
not factory which uses all the naturals as ingredients.

839
02:14:18,316 --> 02:14:23,561
5000 babies die in a day I
India due to less of vitamins.

840
02:14:28,593 --> 02:14:33,593
If strawberry ﬂavor soap is needed by the rich,
a poor kid can never imagine eating it.

841
02:14:39,504 --> 02:14:41,506
Are you trying to say water is so expensive?

842
02:14:44,643 --> 02:14:47,146
Just water?

843
02:14:47,813 --> 02:14:52,813
2G is just air and is been sold here for millions,
than how about water. No water no life.

844
02:15:03,361 --> 02:15:10,142
We decided to do this to help our village.

845
02:15:15,674 --> 02:15:20,674
We truly apologize to all ladies and childrens
whom suffered without water for the pass 3 days.

846
02:15:35,193 --> 02:15:37,036
In another 40 minutes
you will get the water.

847
02:15:38,029 --> 02:15:42,671
But for the village it depends on
the decision given in the court later.

848
02:15:44,469 --> 02:15:50,511
I hope the cops won't follow us now
because it will delay the water supply again.

849
02:15:51,810 --> 02:15:55,121
We will surrender tomorrow
in court for doing this.

850
02:16:09,094 --> 02:16:11,973
Angita you follow them.

851
02:16:14,966 --> 02:16:21,247
Bring them to the place I told you,
I will be there at night.

852
02:16:23,241 --> 02:16:24,720
We don't know where is Jeeva.

853
02:16:25,010 --> 02:16:28,048
Calcutta Police are down as well.

854
02:16:29,214 --> 02:16:31,353
Ok no worries.

855
02:16:46,097 --> 02:16:52,981
So he is Kathir.

856
02:16:53,572 --> 02:16:55,142
Good.

857
02:16:57,609 --> 02:17:03,525
Anyhow your village will be mine.

858
02:17:33,712 --> 02:17:36,352
Grandpa you have a call.

859
02:17:38,783 --> 02:17:42,321
Yes child you saw me in theTV is it.

860
02:17:43,088 --> 02:17:48,088
It's my granddaughter...

861
02:17:59,170 --> 02:18:02,310
She is calling because
would have seen me on TV.

862
02:18:05,176 --> 02:18:08,316
Ravi! Looks like you and
Kathir play a good roll on TV.

863
02:18:09,681 --> 02:18:13,254
lam feeling so proud of you
and did not expect this from Kathir.

864
02:18:13,485 --> 02:18:15,988
Round of applause from our gang.

865
02:18:17,055 --> 02:18:23,165
Why is Kathir mentioned as Jeeva.
Did he change his name?

866
02:18:24,996 --> 02:18:31,277
What happened,
why aren't he speaking but he is active.

867
02:18:36,775 --> 02:18:38,618
Son, who is Kathir?

868
02:18:40,312 --> 02:18:43,555
No I was just simply calling.

869
02:18:58,330 --> 02:18:59,741
When will be Kathir back?

870
02:19:00,632 --> 02:19:03,044
Kathir will be back soon,
you eat ﬁrst.

871
02:19:06,504 --> 02:19:08,142
What name did you mention?

872
02:19:30,161 --> 02:19:35,042
The 1O of you must sign on this.

873
02:19:35,166 --> 02:19:36,304
What is it written on it?

874
02:19:39,971 --> 02:19:47,719
That we are withdrawing the case
and giving them our village.

875
02:19:48,046 --> 02:19:53,046
What you mean our village, how much did
you sell all of us and where is Jeeva!

876
02:19:59,991 --> 02:20:02,198
Cool down.

877
02:20:03,027 --> 02:20:08,306
Why did you cheat us moreover we are old.

878
02:20:09,134 --> 02:20:11,410
Another word you speak
I won't respect your age anymore.

879
02:20:12,170 --> 02:20:17,170
Yes we wanted to cheat in the beginning. Ones
he knew your village story he changed his mind.

880
02:20:21,079 --> 02:20:27,052
It is because his mum was a farmer like all of you and
died in an accident when came to work here in the city.

881
02:20:29,053 --> 02:20:32,057
He don't want you all to suffer like his mum,
that is why he did all this.

882
02:20:32,157 --> 02:20:39,598
You think he did all of this and
took all this risk for money is it.

883
02:20:40,064 --> 02:20:44,376
Now also he must be asking the signature
to safe Jeeva but not for money.

884
02:20:45,336 --> 02:20:49,751
You all don't know the real love that
why your own kids leave all of you.

885
02:20:52,510 --> 02:20:54,456
How can you say that.

886
02:20:55,814 --> 02:21:00,814
Please trust me and sign on the paper so
I can safe Jeeva. We will anyhow win the case.

887
02:21:09,561 --> 02:21:12,565
Trust me.

888
02:21:15,767 --> 02:21:17,269
Son give me the paper.

889
02:21:42,293 --> 02:21:44,273
Jeeva must be back.

890
02:21:44,429 --> 02:21:51,438
We must get water in our village.
We will all die if any one of this don't happen.

891
02:21:54,405 --> 02:21:56,043
You will get both of it.

892
02:21:56,741 --> 02:21:58,550
Even if I myself die.

893
02:22:25,270 --> 02:22:26,112
All the sign matches sir.

894
02:23:22,393 --> 02:23:23,371
Release him out.

895
02:23:23,728 --> 02:23:26,470
I did not ask you to
come here to send him away.

896
02:23:27,198 --> 02:23:29,041
I also didn't come here
to give you this paper.

897
02:24:49,047 --> 02:24:51,027
You go I will take care.

898
02:26:40,191 --> 02:26:43,104
Come, Come !!

899
02:27:53,164 --> 02:27:56,338
You leave I will take care.

900
02:27:56,767 --> 02:27:58,337
Kathir, you?

901
02:27:59,537 --> 02:28:08,457
Tomorrow is the judgment and your
life is very important, please leave.

902
02:28:09,013 --> 02:28:09,650
Jeeva!

903
02:28:11,282 --> 02:28:20,532
Please tell them that I had
lied to them but not my love.

904
02:28:33,037 --> 02:28:34,141
Go!

905
02:28:58,996 --> 02:29:02,239
We asked him back Jeeva
and water for the village.

906
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:08,951
None of us said that you
;also must come back safely.

907
02:29:30,094 --> 02:29:34,474
Kathir is here.

908
02:29:52,750 --> 02:29:56,197
Kathir!

909
02:30:02,126 --> 02:30:03,662
lam going to the main power supply.

910
02:30:20,277 --> 02:30:25,277
The case has came to a end and after all the hassle the
villagers get back their land and also with the water supply.

911
02:30:55,146 --> 02:31:00,146
Besides that the court has given order to investigate all the other
villages and sort the problems which the farmers are facing.

912
02:31:13,030 --> 02:31:21,176
Besides that Jeeva and the 40 people whom
stopped the water for 3 days will not be punished.

913
02:31:46,397 --> 02:31:48,604
Excuse me please.

914
02:31:51,335 --> 02:31:54,248
Jeeva, Kathir wants to speak to you.

915
02:31:56,040 --> 02:32:00,318
Kathir where are you, please come
here now I need to show them all.

916
02:32:12,056 --> 02:32:18,098
Nope, this is your dream.
Only you should be there.

917
02:32:19,997 --> 02:32:25,447
But still I feel it's not fair
since you have done a lot.

918
02:32:26,170 --> 02:32:33,645
Now all the farmers have faith
that Jeeva is in the back of them.

919
02:32:37,148 --> 02:32:42,427
Anyhow I am still a jailbird.

920
02:32:44,755 --> 02:32:48,293
it's not right for me to be there.

921
02:32:57,468 --> 02:32:59,812
Can you pass the line to Angita?

922
02:33:07,678 --> 02:33:12,058
I don't know how am
I going to explain to you?

923
02:33:13,384 --> 02:33:18,384
You have a good heart and everything
will be ﬁne. I will wait for you even its forever.
