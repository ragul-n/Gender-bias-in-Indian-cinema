1
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:32,500
I'm not a feather,parrot...
Sky is not too high...!!

2
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:37,330
If you become seeds on the earth
this earth won't be burdened

3
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:42,170
There's no age limit to play...
you play like a Rabbit!!

4
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:46,840
Search your role
on the earth!!

5
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:32,227
Are five sense creatures not
living?Are they not happy?

6
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:37,061
We've sixth sense,Is it
a problem for us?

7
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:41,561
Doesn't this earth has
endless happiness?

8
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:44,075
Can't you see that in
woman's eyes?

9
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:48,902
We've filled our lives with
tears!!

10
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:51,411
Happiness in life...

11
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:56,254
It's not in days...

12
00:02:59,612 --> 00:03:08,259
Even flies which are short lived
It'll search the light...!!

13
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:01,314
Hey!it's very nice...

14
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:04,822
Teacher,look there...look there

15
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:20,838
Who are you?

16
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:25,004
Why are you wearing masks?

17
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:27,669
We always live on this
earth with false faces

18
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:30,006
We're not able to live
like Mahatmas

19
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:34,511
Atleast by wearing masks
we wish to be as Mahatmas

20
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:39,353
Madam,if wishes & dreams
can come true

21
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:41,688
I wish to be like the great
poet Thiruvalluvar

22
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:56,036
Won't you say who you are?
-We're like orphans

23
00:04:56,396 --> 00:05:00,037
Meaning?...
-We're all dejected youth!!

24
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,039
We got shackled by the circumstances
..we're lifeless wastrels

25
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:05,378
We're"life prisoners",you can
call us anything

26
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:09,379
Now we're on parole,in short
we've lost our lives...

27
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,718
Do you want more than this?
...Don't want...

28
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:35,742
Only Yesterday,I asked for
a motorcycle from mother

29
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:40,751
Father agreed & mother asked
me to come immediately...

30
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:45,422
What type of motorcycle
do you want?

31
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:51,253
No...it's alright,if you buy
any other one also...

32
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:54,261
Okay...I'll try...

33
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:03,773
Look at the back...

34
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:07,611
Is that the one you
wanted?

35
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:38,472
From morning,he's dancing
like this...

36
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:39,802
Mother,he's disturbing me
a lot...

37
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:49,145
Brother is head over heels
in love

38
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:00,656
Yuck!are you jumping like
this only for that?

39
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:06,163
I've a shooting for
a T.V.programme...

40
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:09,002
...Is Shooting to-day...

41
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:11,334
Shooting?Brother,I'll come to
watch...?-You silly...

42
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:16,836
I'm going to dance
in that programme..

43
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:20,517
What Dance?

44
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:29,358
Oh! Human being...oh! Human being!!

45
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:33,197
I asked,who's human being here?

46
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:38,024
If you say"I'm",I won't
believe...l won't...

47
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:45,866
Your life is full of bribes...
everything is cheating...!!

48
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:49,880
Even Devil will get scared
on seeing you!!

49
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:13,226
Has your heart become dark?
ls bribe your life?

50
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:17,564
Is justice dead?has righteousness
vanished?

51
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:05,616
I don't have Heart...-
Even then,I'm not asking for bribes...

52
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:14,286
You've heart,but you won't sleep
without taking bribes!!

53
00:09:18,824 --> 00:09:22,636
Will you take bribes,if you
don't have heart?

54
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:28,972
Oh!Lord Brahma,hereafter create
human beings without heartsH

55
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:33,640
Oh!Lord Brahma...
Oh! Lord Brahma...

56
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:42,651
Sorry for the interruption

57
00:09:43,015 --> 00:09:45,825
Robot's battery has rundown...
I'll change it...

58
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:47,998
Thank you...

59
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:12,014
When your father sees this programme
on the T.V.,he'll be shocked

60
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:15,518
...Why?-This song depicts your father's
trait,isn't it?

61
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:18,028
What did you say?
-This bribe song...

62
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:23,697
...I'll kill you..
my father is a judge

63
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:24,867
The entire city is laughing
at your father

64
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:27,029
Being a judge,he takes
bribes...

65
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:29,866
Hey! my father is like God
he's an honest man

66
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:32,702
What will you do if I
prove you?...will you die?

67
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:36,213
If you prove it,I'll commit
suicide!

68
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:39,974
...I'll kill you...leave him...

69
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:49,727
What did brother say about
motorcycle?

70
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:54,223
Did he like this model?
-He was very happy on seeing it

71
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:57,897
Really?this case has
started...

72
00:10:58,257 --> 00:11:01,727
So,I came to see you & to
give this also

73
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:06,732
You've given motorcycle,isn't it?
-Let that be as my gift for your son

74
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:11,241
I've brought this for you...
-For me?...why all these?...what's inside?

75
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:12,745
Keep this as offerings...

76
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,420
Sir,I'm depending on
you only...

77
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:19,757
if you give judgment in
favour of me-

78
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:21,754
I'll get property worth
<i>7</i> crores

79
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:26,096
As we spoke earlier,I've brought
half of the money now

80
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:28,094
When are you going to die?

81
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:31,267
Can I take the offering
along with the suitcase?

82
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:44,444
When did you come?
-At the time you received the offering...

83
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:04,624
Father,I thought you were
an honest & a just person

84
00:12:24,443 --> 00:12:27,322
MRT,can we talk regarding
marriage proposal in the office itself?

85
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:29,823
For whom?as I'm a widower
are you looking for me?

86
00:12:30,182 --> 00:12:31,661
You said,that you don't have
that idea...

87
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:33,489
Even after 3 yrs of your
wife's death

88
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:36,493
I'm talking about your
son,Gowtham's marriage

89
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:38,995
Tell me,if you know
any good family...

90
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:44,838
Our V.C.T wishes to fix her daughter's
marriage with your son

91
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:48,011
V.C.T?...Has he himself said?

92
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:50,673
He has given his daughter's photo
look at this..

93
00:12:56,542 --> 00:13:00,354
How will it be if M.R.T & V.C.T
become kinsmen?

94
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,690
It'll be like the relationship
of Tata & Birla

95
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:06,363
What's it,Suguna?

96
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:08,856
I've bought the file,you had asked
-Keep it & go...

97
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:14,363
I'm very happy with this alliance
ask him to proceed

98
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:45,903
The answer is hidden in
the Maize Field...

99
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:49,903
Where is that Maize Field?

100
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:55,407
...This is Maize Field...

101
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,590
Dear Gowtham
I'm not N.Suguna

102
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,428
I'm your Suguna...

103
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:56,634
Oh! Maize Field!!
Bull is hungry...

104
00:14:57,329 --> 00:15:00,310
Come & have relationship
with me...

105
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,814
There's no fence..play...

106
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:11,318
Oh!cool breeze!this sapling
is shying...

107
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:18,489
Step in carefully & hug me...

108
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:51,354
Will you take a good bath?

109
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:55,191
Will you hug me till my
desire ends?

110
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:58,867
Will you take me in
your arms?

111
00:15:59,558 --> 00:16:02,368
Will you complete our play?

112
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:08,868
I'm eager to compete with you
don't you wish?

113
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:16,212
There are laws in the play...
do we need weapons on the bed?

114
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:23,550
Oh! my dear...let's start
our love play

115
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:30,731
Oh! Dear! let my heart beat be
in sync with your rhythm

116
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:35,072
There's a new song in the program...
Listen to it well...

117
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:38,742
...You dance on movements
as you wish...

118
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:26,456
The ridge is bridging the field

119
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:30,119
It's difficult to hide my age...

120
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:33,630
The kid is hidden by
the old sheep

121
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:37,129
It's difficult to hide
the character

122
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:43,637
When will the ant come out
from the Honey?

123
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:50,973
What will happen to my youth which
is trapped with the woman?

124
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:58,311
I'm tempted by so many
thoughts

125
00:17:59,344 --> 00:18:05,659
Oh! Is it happiness?...I'm moving
to you by seeing you

126
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:13,497
Oh! Lover!! What's this play?...
look at somewhere

127
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:52,375
Don't call me to
a boring drama like this

128
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:53,702
Then only we can comment
on that...

129
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,224
Who's that motorcycle man?

130
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:16,896
My boss,M.R.T's son,Gowtham

131
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:21,567
Can I switch on the fan?

132
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:27,570
You're saying that he's loving
you,will he marry you?

133
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:36,586
If you want to marry him,shouldn't
we look the horoscope?

134
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:41,584
You get married by looking
the horoscope Isn't it?

135
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:43,919
At the age of 30,father died
Isn't it?

136
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:51,598
Ask Suguna to come here with
that Refund Tax file

137
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:55,101
ls Suguna on leave today?...

138
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:01,438
Sir,if you want the file,I'll
take...-Don't want...

139
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:02,771
I'll refer in the computer

140
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:35,141
Father,why are you sitting here?
-Because I shouldn't miss you...

141
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:38,474
You've done 2 mistakes-
What are you saying?

142
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:42,645
You've used office computer
for personal use

143
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:47,816
Office computer is not a letter pad
to write love letters

144
00:20:49,681 --> 00:20:50,318
Father,it's wrong...

145
00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:54,986
It's a big mistake that you've loved
the one who's working for me

146
00:20:58,523 --> 00:21:01,163
You can pinpoint the computer
That's related to you...

147
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:04,333
But my love is related
to me...

148
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:06,001
I'll break your teeth,rascal...

149
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:07,836
You ask...

150
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:10,672
I brought up with utmost care,a motherless
child like you

151
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:14,184
As your father,I've to decide
about your future

152
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:17,846
I've fixed your alliance with
V.C.T.'s daughter

153
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:20,682
I want to change you as
a billionaire from a millionaire

154
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:23,193
I won't leave my dreams
to shattered...

155
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:28,197
You've right to dream

156
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,360
Don't kill me to fulfill
your dream!

157
00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:33,862
Should you not ask me?

158
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:35,037
No need-How can you say
'No need'?

159
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:37,867
Father,please,listen to me...
-I won't...l won't

160
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:40,369
There's no change in my decision
you can go...

161
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:44,547
I'm not ready to listen
to your arguments

162
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:47,209
I know what you youngsters
will say...

163
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:49,381
Father,don't show your adamancy

164
00:21:49,574 --> 00:21:51,383
No,I won't listen,already
I've committed

165
00:21:51,576 --> 00:21:54,056
There's no use of your talk
-father,listen to me...

166
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:56,893
I know what you'll say...

167
00:22:01,753 --> 00:22:04,393
I'm going to give a new life
to a poor girl

168
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:06,068
I've promised...

169
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:09,067
I should fulfill my promise

170
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:12,909
Oh! you should fulfill?

171
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:16,242
I'll make you to break that
promise

172
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:18,907
Are you challenging your father?

173
00:22:19,271 --> 00:22:21,410
Okay let it be a challenge

174
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:23,252
If you can,do it...

175
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:28,591
But,you can't win!!

176
00:22:29,781 --> 00:22:31,920
I feel shy to call him
as my father

177
00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:36,925
I haven't heard a man,being
a judge taking bribes

178
00:22:38,957 --> 00:22:41,096
Don't shout by standing
in the rain

179
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:42,772
I'm getting embarrassed
Come inside

180
00:22:42,961 --> 00:22:43,769
I won't come

181
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:46,606
This is the punishment for me
for his crime

182
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:49,776
I didn't believe when I
heard about him

183
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:51,948
I didn't believe,until
I saw myself...

184
00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:55,281
In this country,if bribe
enters into the court itself

185
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:56,953
Then,there won't be any progress
in this country

186
00:22:57,809 --> 00:23:00,449
If I've the right to punish him I
would've given him death sentence

187
00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:04,127
Shut up...why are you
talking unnecessarily?

188
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:06,125
Mother,being a judge,
he's taking bribes...

189
00:23:07,152 --> 00:23:08,631
Who is not taking
bribes in this world?

190
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,959
He is also a human being
Is he Mahatma?

191
00:23:11,156 --> 00:23:13,466
Doesn't he have a family?

192
00:23:13,825 --> 00:23:14,462
Mother,what's this?

193
00:23:14,826 --> 00:23:16,965
You too are justifying father's
crime

194
00:23:17,162 --> 00:23:18,300
Yes,Then what?

195
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:21,470
How can salary alone be sufficient to
maintain the status?

196
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:22,971
Have you ever thought?

197
00:23:23,668 --> 00:23:26,308
Do you know the pay of
a Gardener?

198
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:28,484
Cost of car's petrol?

199
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:32,148
How can we furnish the house
with rose wood & marble?

200
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:33,648
Leave those things

201
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:34,823
We've 2 daughters...

202
00:23:35,013 --> 00:23:36,492
Shouldn't they've Jewels?

203
00:23:36,681 --> 00:23:39,821
Shouldn't we perform their marriages
in a Grand manner?

204
00:23:41,686 --> 00:23:45,156
Those husbands who take bribes have such wives
then you can't abolish bribes

205
00:23:45,524 --> 00:23:48,334
It is out of fashion to equate
bribe with crime

206
00:23:48,693 --> 00:23:49,831
First you know that

207
00:23:52,697 --> 00:23:55,507
Putting money in the temple's
donation box is also a bribe

208
00:23:55,867 --> 00:23:57,676
It's a bribe to get our
wishes fulfilled

209
00:23:57,869 --> 00:23:58,677
...Great talk

210
00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:03,186
When you're young,you
sermonize honesty

211
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:04,683
You should grow beyond that

212
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,698
Sit down...

213
00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:20,370
I haven't come here to sit
I came here to warn

214
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:22,868
I've fixed a rich alliance
for my son

215
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:26,205
I don't like your daughter
loving my son

216
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:28,878
I also don't like it

217
00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:33,205
We should stop their proximity
before it's too late

218
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:35,381
We can't use force for that

219
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:38,384
I don't know what to do

220
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:42,548
It's in your hand to stop
their romance

221
00:24:46,084 --> 00:24:47,893
...Think that it's in our hands

222
00:24:50,088 --> 00:24:52,568
After hearing the arguments
of both sides

223
00:24:52,924 --> 00:24:55,234
We came to know 2 things

224
00:24:55,594 --> 00:24:59,064
Before the judgment,I want to
explain to you

225
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,238
He shouldn't give judgment

226
00:25:04,102 --> 00:25:05,740
He's not fit to be a judge

227
00:25:07,105 --> 00:25:09,745
He doesn't have the right to sit
on the honorable chair

228
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:12,755
He's not Vanjinath
He's bribenath!!

229
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:15,758
Don't respect the man who
sells justice

230
00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:18,261
Don't allow him to
preside here

231
00:25:18,617 --> 00:25:22,258
I'm his son.But,I've a conscience
listen to me...

232
00:25:41,806 --> 00:25:43,786
Why has your father called me?

233
00:25:44,142 --> 00:25:45,450
I'm very scared

234
00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:47,619
Will he threaten you by
calling you to the house?

235
00:25:48,146 --> 00:25:49,625
Then,why this muscular body
is here?

236
00:25:50,148 --> 00:25:51,456
There may be some other reason...

237
00:25:51,983 --> 00:25:53,792
Is it to discuss about
our marriage?

238
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:57,126
Yes,only son..motherless child...

239
00:25:57,989 --> 00:25:59,468
He won't do anything against
my wish..

240
00:26:00,158 --> 00:26:01,136
Watch..

241
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:05,134
He might've gone to call the priest
to fix the auspicious time

242
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:08,807
He might've gone to buy a new
bed for us

243
00:26:18,176 --> 00:26:19,484
Step in with your right foot

244
00:26:53,712 --> 00:26:54,190
Come...

245
00:26:55,046 --> 00:26:56,684
He's my son,Gowtham

246
00:26:57,215 --> 00:26:59,195
She's Suguna's mother

247
00:27:01,553 --> 00:27:03,362
We need a Mahalakshmi for
this house...

248
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:04,863
You need a mother...

249
00:27:05,223 --> 00:27:08,033
I married her considering all
these things

250
00:27:08,226 --> 00:27:10,206
Now only in the Registrar's office...

251
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:12,875
Now Suguna's mother is also
your mother

252
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:14,536
A new relationship...

253
00:27:18,236 --> 00:27:20,716
Now,What's your relationship
with Suguna?

254
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:22,548
Sister...

255
00:27:27,078 --> 00:27:28,887
You said I should give life
to a poor girl

256
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,559
I've given life to a widow

257
00:27:30,915 --> 00:27:32,223
Think which social service
is better?

258
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:33,392
You go inside...

259
00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:52,404
Father planned well & deceived me

260
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,750
You used to say that no one
can deceive me

261
00:28:00,111 --> 00:28:02,250
Your father himself has
deceived you

262
00:28:03,114 --> 00:28:04,422
That too,how?...

263
00:28:07,118 --> 00:28:10,588
Suguna,we'll prove it to them
we'll elope

264
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:14,766
Why are you laughing?

265
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:17,098
Are we going to elope
as brother & sister?

266
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:21,440
Hereafter thinking about our
love is meaningless

267
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:23,275
Then...

268
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:26,111
There're only 2 ways

269
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:29,285
One,I should kill him & go
to jail

270
00:28:30,141 --> 00:28:31,279
Or I should commit suicide

271
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:34,449
Gowtham,I'm not confused
like you...

272
00:28:35,313 --> 00:28:36,951
The house in which I should
enter as a daughter-in-law

273
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:41,127
I'll go as a daughter & formulate
my future plans

274
00:28:43,988 --> 00:28:45,797
I'll never step in that
house...

275
00:28:47,792 --> 00:28:49,635
Felicitations to me?

276
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:51,630
For giving life to
a widow

277
00:28:52,997 --> 00:28:53,634
...As you wish

278
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:02,750
Along with the happy news
you're saying bad news?

279
00:29:03,942 --> 00:29:05,819
It's alright,I'll manage
Thank you for your information

280
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:13,394
It seems Income Tax people are coming
for a raid

281
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,322
...Oh God!Are they coming
for a raid?

282
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:16,494
Don't get agitated

283
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:18,995
Felicitations & Tax raid are common
for a Rich man

284
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:22,134
Yes,why should we worry?
we haven't done anything wrong isn't it?

285
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:23,565
We've done...

286
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,512
Sir,come...why have you come yourself
by taking the car?

287
00:30:38,937 --> 00:30:42,146
Change the oil & service the car...

288
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:44,418
I'll come...myself for delivery...

289
00:30:45,043 --> 00:30:46,215
Shall I sell this car?

290
00:30:46,878 --> 00:30:48,016
A party is asking for Rs.15,000/-

291
00:30:48,213 --> 00:30:51,854
Rs.15000/-?...its Worth Rs.15 lakhs

292
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:53,789
This car is very sentiment
for me

293
00:30:54,219 --> 00:30:56,597
Nothing to hurry,it's alright if you
take 2 days more also

294
00:30:57,455 --> 00:30:59,264
Do it properly,I'll go
-Okay

295
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:19,685
Suguna,I'm very scared
-Why?

296
00:31:20,411 --> 00:31:21,185
They've come for a raid

297
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:23,454
Let them come,are you going
to lose your chastity?

298
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:24,853
We're going to lose only
black money

299
00:31:25,617 --> 00:31:27,688
Then,what other questions
they asked you?

300
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:30,465
They asked why did he marry
your mother?

301
00:31:30,755 --> 00:31:32,257
You should've asked them
how is it concerned with them?

302
00:31:32,457 --> 00:31:35,233
I did ask them,this is a
silly question

303
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:39,133
He's virile & my mother has desire
and still young

304
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:41,068
I asked them,what can we
do between them?

305
00:31:42,533 --> 00:31:43,136
I'm right,isn't it?

306
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:46,404
What's you're torturing me,without
understanding my predicament?

307
00:31:47,138 --> 00:31:49,311
I decided this for
your future

308
00:31:49,841 --> 00:31:50,979
All these are just excuses

309
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:53,819
You both are cheats
I'll tell you one thing...

310
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:56,490
I won't let you both live peacefully
for shattering our dreams

311
00:31:57,181 --> 00:31:58,159
I won't let you live peacefully

312
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:13,407
Gowtham,why are you
standing here?

313
00:32:13,965 --> 00:32:15,000
Your father left this car
for service

314
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,677
Car is ready,will you
take it?

315
00:32:18,503 --> 00:32:19,914
No...you take it by yourself

316
00:32:20,338 --> 00:32:21,976
What's it?Don't you want
a car?

317
00:32:22,473 --> 00:32:23,781
Take a test ride,its flying
like wind

318
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:28,184
Okay,I'll take it myself
It may help me anytime

319
00:32:47,432 --> 00:32:50,879
Swamiji,Boss isn't well
for sometime

320
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:52,370
He's worried very much

321
00:32:53,104 --> 00:32:54,378
What's predicted for him?

322
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,543
Tell us if there are any
remedials to be done

323
00:33:00,511 --> 00:33:04,049
There is no danger to your
life for 20 years

324
00:33:04,282 --> 00:33:06,319
My predictions never fail

325
00:33:06,584 --> 00:33:09,394
But one condition...your
wife should be with you

326
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:14,998
I'm unlucky,I married twice
and both wives died

327
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,341
You marry another girl &
after your Nuptials

328
00:33:18,596 --> 00:33:22,408
You both as a couple pray for
21 days,that'll be your remedy

329
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:25,078
Then you'll get rid of all your
problems like health,agony...etc.

330
00:33:26,104 --> 00:33:28,243
Where can I find a maiden
for me?

331
00:33:48,626 --> 00:33:52,506
Accountant,what's your
daughter's age?

332
00:33:53,464 --> 00:33:53,942
Boss

333
00:33:54,298 --> 00:33:57,108
Do you've any sense,who asked
you to give the car to Gowtham?

334
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:00,278
Didn't I tell you that I'll
take the car myself?

335
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:01,409
You over enthusiastic idiot

336
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:02,647
What's it?What happened?

337
00:34:04,075 --> 00:34:05,281
There are 12 lakhs in
the dicky

338
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:07,050
Gowtham has taken the car along
with that...

339
00:34:08,246 --> 00:34:09,247
I don't know where he has gone?

340
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:10,357
Shall we lodge a complaint
with Police?

341
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:12,626
Do you've any sense?
Its black money?

342
00:34:13,684 --> 00:34:15,129
I'm in a position of a
cheater getting cheated

343
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:25,800
Don't worry!There isn't a rich man
who doesn't come to this place

344
00:34:25,997 --> 00:34:31,310
Punjab Governor was here last week
to ask about conducting elections

345
00:34:31,769 --> 00:34:35,307
Before that,Assam Minister
came here

346
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:37,075
To Know whether,he'll
continue as a Minister or not

347
00:34:37,942 --> 00:34:39,649
What's this you're referring
about other States only...

348
00:34:40,144 --> 00:34:41,179
Tamilnadu people will also
come here

349
00:34:41,946 --> 00:34:46,326
But,they'll come secretly at
Nights hiding their faces

350
00:34:47,318 --> 00:34:48,319
They don't believe in
these isn't it?

351
00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:55,828
Sir,an important matter...

352
00:34:58,162 --> 00:34:58,970
I want to talk to you alone

353
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:07,015
Sir,I've lost Rs.12 lakhs

354
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:10,517
I don't want to tell you
what sort of money is that

355
00:35:11,642 --> 00:35:12,518
Your Black ink will tell it

356
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:16,182
Will I get it back?
Where's it now?

357
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:19,091
Sir,it's not a small amount
its Rs.12 lakhs

358
00:35:26,324 --> 00:35:30,704
Hill station...looks like
a Tea Estate...

359
00:35:31,829 --> 00:35:33,365
A big red tin box

360
00:35:34,532 --> 00:35:36,205
That's a moving red box...

361
00:35:39,036 --> 00:35:41,038
Are you able to locate
the place?

362
00:35:41,706 --> 00:35:44,880
It isn't clear,but its a
4 letter City

363
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:47,746
4 letter city

364
00:35:48,846 --> 00:35:49,881
Rs.12 lakhs?

365
00:35:50,581 --> 00:35:51,719
Hill station...

366
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:53,724
Tea Estate...

367
00:35:54,385 --> 00:35:55,386
4 letter city...

368
00:36:05,396 --> 00:36:06,397
A girl who stays
in the out house...

369
00:36:06,764 --> 00:36:08,903
Isn't it an achievement to
become owner of the house?

370
00:36:09,634 --> 00:36:10,669
It's right to become the
owner of the house

371
00:36:11,035 --> 00:36:12,673
But,you're asking me to become
a wife of a corpse

372
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:15,143
Let it be but its a
Billionaire's corpse

373
00:36:15,373 --> 00:36:17,182
Think about the life you're going
to live after that

374
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:21,252
You're not arranging marriage
you're acting like a pimp

375
00:36:23,748 --> 00:36:25,091
Don't I have desires?

376
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:27,757
My child,Don't mistake me

377
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:29,493
This is a marriage of convenience

378
00:36:31,789 --> 00:36:33,598
You take it as freedom...
or anything

379
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:36,270
Yuck!Are you not ashamed?

380
00:36:37,094 --> 00:36:40,837
To make your boss to live 20 more
years,Am I the scapegoat?

381
00:36:41,666 --> 00:36:44,875
Or will that fraud Swamiji's
predictions come true?

382
00:36:45,069 --> 00:36:48,676
Okay,let the predictions be false

383
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,184
Then,you'll be a Billionaire’s
widow isn't it?

384
00:36:54,178 --> 00:36:57,785
If I'm a burden for you...
...you kill me...

385
00:36:58,416 --> 00:37:02,125
For whom do you think all this?
It's all for you only

386
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:05,867
For generations we worked as
Accountants and slaves

387
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:07,464
We've got such a good opportunity

388
00:37:08,025 --> 00:37:12,269
Fortune of Diamonds,pearls,Good life
is knocking your door

389
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:17,472
I've promised my Boss if you didn't
agree,I'll commit suicide

390
00:37:33,651 --> 00:37:36,564
What's this?On cleaning the board
you're luck is coming...

391
00:37:37,722 --> 00:37:38,496
If I rub that...

392
00:37:38,956 --> 00:37:40,993
"You Fool"

393
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:47,838
Babu,what's it?
-you come here Sabu

394
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:50,844
I want to tell you
a secret

395
00:37:51,035 --> 00:37:51,706
Definitely

396
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:55,172
When I'm going to talk about
important matter,why this Radio?

397
00:37:55,873 --> 00:37:56,715
It's near the ear only isn't it?

398
00:37:56,974 --> 00:37:57,714
But the song is heard outside?

399
00:37:59,977 --> 00:38:00,421
Now,is it heard?

400
00:38:00,978 --> 00:38:01,353
Come on tell

401
00:38:04,148 --> 00:38:04,819
What I try to say is...

402
00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:06,689
Hey!I want to tell you

00:38:06,917 --> 00:38:09,193
First listen to me

Okay,you tell...

406
00:38:12,823 --> 00:38:13,801
What I try to say is...

407
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,297
A big Treasure

408
00:38:15,493 --> 00:38:17,370
Treasure?
-12 lakhs

409
00:38:17,695 --> 00:38:18,537
12 Iakhs?

410
00:38:18,863 --> 00:38:19,933
Hey!How many zeros for 1 lakh?

411
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:25,342
1 lakh...6 zeros
Hey 12 lakhs...

412
00:38:25,503 --> 00:38:27,073
We both will go in search
of that Treasure

413
00:38:27,271 --> 00:38:29,012
If we get it,we'll share 50-50

414
00:38:30,675 --> 00:38:33,383
Mother,bless us...
-What's all this?

415
00:38:33,577 --> 00:38:36,319
Mother,Bless...
Long live...what's the matter?

416
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:40,089
Mother,we're going in search
of a Treasure 12 lakhs...

417
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:42,430
You stupids!12 lakhs?

418
00:38:44,955 --> 00:38:45,626
Mad boys

419
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:54,067
Now,you'll laugh at us
We'll pour 12 lakhs at your feet

420
00:38:54,932 --> 00:38:57,412
After that,we'll share 50-50

421
00:38:58,602 --> 00:39:01,082
Each one of us will get 3 zeros

422
00:39:02,373 --> 00:39:05,547
With that money,I'll buy the hotel
where I worked

423
00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:07,517
I'll wear a suit & serve

424
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:11,251
What's this funny?Both of your
sons are talking together same

425
00:39:11,749 --> 00:39:14,423
If they're very excited
they'll talk together

426
00:39:14,618 --> 00:39:17,428
Like twin pipes both are
rare brothers

427
00:39:17,621 --> 00:39:21,068
They're twins...if I beat him
he'll cry

428
00:39:21,292 --> 00:39:22,771
If he's hungry,he'll
cry for food

429
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:30,423
Water. . . .water. . ..
...water. . .water...

430
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:50,854
water. . .water...

431
00:41:14,171 --> 00:41:15,707
I've came to take
your statement

432
00:41:18,108 --> 00:41:18,711
What's your name?

433
00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:23,781
Why did you travel alone
in the lst class?

434
00:41:24,849 --> 00:41:26,055
I don't have anyone to
travel with me

435
00:41:27,451 --> 00:41:28,429
Why did you travel in the night?

436
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:29,794
You're coming alone,isn't it?

437
00:41:30,387 --> 00:41:31,991
I got ticket only in the night train

438
00:41:32,857 --> 00:41:34,131
How many people raped you?

439
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:50,245
4...4 people

440
00:41:51,742 --> 00:41:55,747
Do you've any evidence for fighting
against the rape?

441
00:41:57,815 --> 00:42:00,659
Sir,I was alone...They
were 4 people

442
00:42:01,752 --> 00:42:03,754
Two of them held my hands

443
00:42:04,555 --> 00:42:07,092
How can I struggle against them?

444
00:42:10,127 --> 00:42:14,098
No,they may say that,this was
happened with your permission isn't it?

445
00:42:14,732 --> 00:42:16,609
Sir,why are you asking
indecent questions?

446
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:20,278
Many Policemen miss while
filing FIR

447
00:42:21,071 --> 00:42:21,981
I want to be careful

448
00:42:23,674 --> 00:42:25,551
Did all the 4 raped
at a time...

449
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:27,455
or Individually?

450
00:42:29,847 --> 00:42:32,020
I'm not interested to file
a case with the Police

451
00:42:32,816 --> 00:42:34,454
Nothing happened to me

452
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:37,457
Sir,I jumped from a running
train on my own

453
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:43,835
Is it enough?I beg you...
please leave me...

454
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:51,006
It doesn't appear to be questions
for enquiry

455
00:42:51,368 --> 00:42:52,870
You seem to be a pervert

456
00:42:56,006 --> 00:42:58,646
You're very much disturbed
I'll come later

457
00:43:20,564 --> 00:43:22,601
I'm working as a receptionist
in the hotel

458
00:43:23,867 --> 00:43:26,245
I was travelling by train
to my home town

459
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:28,245
I was to get married in
a week

460
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,849
How will I go home now?

461
00:43:32,977 --> 00:43:35,457
How can I marry another person?...

462
00:43:36,647 --> 00:43:38,422
What's left with me?

463
00:43:47,024 --> 00:43:49,903
They should've killed,thrown
my body isn't it?

464
00:43:51,061 --> 00:43:54,941
Or I should've died,when I was thrown
away from a running train isn't it?

465
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:00,571
It's surprise

466
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:06,219
You escaped before your marriage
But I escaped after marriage

467
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:09,457
Now,we must escape
from the Police

468
00:44:10,547 --> 00:44:13,323
That too,before that bore Inspector
comes we should escape

469
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:42,081
Hey!Get down...

470
00:44:45,215 --> 00:44:45,920
Who permitted you to get
into the car?

471
00:44:46,116 --> 00:44:47,686
Is it your father's car?

472
00:45:21,018 --> 00:45:22,554
Father,we're here for
the past 45 minutes

473
00:45:22,786 --> 00:45:24,766
Still,we couldn't meet him?...
Let's go...

474
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:28,730
We've come for his recommendation
we should be patient

475
00:45:28,992 --> 00:45:33,463
For 3 years...I've been patient
It's 3 years since I finished studies

476
00:45:33,697 --> 00:45:34,437
Not yet got a job...

477
00:45:34,998 --> 00:45:35,806
That's your fate

478
00:45:36,467 --> 00:45:38,879
You're responsible for my fate
-What are you saying?

479
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:39,911
Why were you born as a"Mudaliar?"

480
00:45:40,671 --> 00:45:42,810
You were born as poor
Why weren't you born as SC & ST?

481
00:45:43,373 --> 00:45:45,910
What's so great about a "Mudaliar"?
If asked they say its Forward Caste

482
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:47,350
They're refusing jobs to us

483
00:45:49,012 --> 00:45:51,686
Atleast you could've born as
a Rich Mudaliar?

484
00:45:51,982 --> 00:45:53,154
I wouldn't have struggled for
a job

485
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:56,523
Is it the time to do research
on our births?

486
00:45:57,054 --> 00:45:58,590
Only now,we've got time
to sit together

487
00:45:59,189 --> 00:46:01,066
Don't blabber,look he's coming...

488
00:46:08,532 --> 00:46:10,273
I told you to study for
a teacher's job like me

489
00:46:10,701 --> 00:46:11,179
Did you listen to me?

490
00:46:11,635 --> 00:46:12,636
Only you're fit for that

491
00:46:16,306 --> 00:46:17,512
With this we've already
stood up 10 times

492
00:46:18,308 --> 00:46:19,184
Sir asked you to come up

493
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:25,085
I'm Samivelu,Greetings...
-Sit down

494
00:46:27,217 --> 00:46:30,357
My daughter said that"Tamil teacher
wants to see you..."

495
00:46:31,054 --> 00:46:33,034
What's it? Regarding your
son's job?

496
00:46:33,223 --> 00:46:36,033
Yes,He's my son,Pasupathi

497
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:37,868
He has passed M.A,Msc.

498
00:46:38,829 --> 00:46:40,206
You should recommend him
for some job

499
00:46:41,231 --> 00:46:44,542
Or if you give him some job
at your place it will be nice

500
00:46:44,902 --> 00:46:45,880
At my place?

501
00:46:48,238 --> 00:46:49,376
You belong to which caste?

502
00:46:49,573 --> 00:46:52,053
Which caste?..."HUMAN CASTE"
!!'Man caste'

503
00:46:52,242 --> 00:46:53,880
When will you leave the habit
of asking caste's name?

504
00:46:54,244 --> 00:46:56,724
He seems to be a great man, providing
jobs for his own caste man

505
00:46:56,914 --> 00:46:59,554
Have you become mad?
-Yes I'm mad

506
00:46:59,917 --> 00:47:02,056
As I got trapped by religion
so,I became mad

507
00:47:02,586 --> 00:47:04,065
Father,kill me...
kill me by beating

508
00:47:04,421 --> 00:47:06,901
Kill me as I'm born
in the"Human caste"

509
00:47:07,424 --> 00:47:07,902
Get out...

510
00:47:11,261 --> 00:47:14,572
There's no difference between human beings
irrespective of their profession

511
00:47:14,932 --> 00:47:15,910
Your Tamil says like this

512
00:47:16,266 --> 00:47:18,246
Hereafter,I don't like
to see you...Get out...

513
00:47:18,936 --> 00:47:21,917
I don't have any feelings
you're not fit to stay here get lost!

514
00:47:22,606 --> 00:47:25,086
Because you're a honourable man

515
00:47:27,611 --> 00:47:29,591
Now if your anger is on me
is justifiable

516
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:30,758
Then my anger is
also justifiable

517
00:47:31,281 --> 00:47:32,919
Father,please give respect
to my feelings also

518
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:34,758
Keep yourself in my
position

519
00:47:37,454 --> 00:47:40,435
"Control your anger otherwise
anger will kill you"...!!

520
00:47:43,293 --> 00:47:46,763
Stop please...
No one is stopping

521
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:48,939
Shall we catch a train & go
to Kunnur?-Don't want

522
00:47:49,299 --> 00:47:50,937
We can save our ticket money by
taking a lift

523
00:47:53,637 --> 00:47:55,617
Sir,hold on...hold on

524
00:47:56,306 --> 00:47:58,286
They've stopped...

525
00:47:59,476 --> 00:48:01,786
Sir,will you take us also?
we'll get down on the way...

526
00:48:02,145 --> 00:48:04,625
Very urgent...but,we won't reveal
the matter

527
00:48:04,982 --> 00:48:06,290
Oh! you get in...

528
00:48:07,985 --> 00:48:10,124
Very nice person...

529
00:48:11,989 --> 00:48:14,299
Sit nicely..-thank you sir

530
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:18,469
Sir,you're like God...

531
00:48:18,662 --> 00:48:20,972
If we reach till Coimbatore
after that we'll catch a lorry...

532
00:48:21,331 --> 00:48:23,311
You're going for an
important matter?-yes sir

533
00:48:23,667 --> 00:48:26,147
We're going to Kunnur we
won't reveal the matter

534
00:48:26,837 --> 00:48:28,817
He's a frog,he'll invite
his own end

535
00:48:30,007 --> 00:48:33,318
Okay,how much money
do you have?

536
00:48:34,678 --> 00:48:36,316
Shall I tell him only?

537
00:48:37,014 --> 00:48:37,992
Sir is a good man

538
00:48:38,849 --> 00:48:41,159
They gave us bonus with that's we
started with Rs 500

539
00:48:43,353 --> 00:48:43,990
Take out money...

540
00:48:44,354 --> 00:48:45,662
What's this? beginning itself
is not good

541
00:48:46,023 --> 00:48:47,331
Did we start at
a bad time?

542
00:48:47,524 --> 00:48:48,161
I'll shoot you...

543
00:48:53,697 --> 00:48:54,675
He's a fool

544
00:48:54,865 --> 00:48:55,343
Why?

545
00:48:56,033 --> 00:48:57,671
He snatched our Rs 500

546
00:48:58,201 --> 00:49:00,181
Secretly I had kept Rs 100 in
my underwear

547
00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:01,508
He left that...you see...

548
00:49:03,874 --> 00:49:04,852
Is he intelligent or me?

549
00:49:14,718 --> 00:49:15,856
Now,is he intelligent or you?

550
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:18,198
Now what can we do?

551
00:49:18,555 --> 00:49:19,192
Now also I'm telling you...

552
00:49:19,389 --> 00:49:20,367
He's a fool

553
00:49:20,724 --> 00:49:23,534
For this reason only,I won't
wear rings on the hand

554
00:49:24,394 --> 00:49:27,375
Look here...I'll wear
on the toes

555
00:49:27,898 --> 00:49:28,535
Now tell me...

556
00:49:28,899 --> 00:49:30,037
Am I intelligent or you?

557
00:49:36,073 --> 00:49:38,713
What a heavy rain?...stop under
this tree

558
00:49:45,248 --> 00:49:46,556
Bharathi you're very poor...

559
00:49:46,917 --> 00:49:48,225
Switch on the headlights

560
00:49:49,586 --> 00:49:51,896
Those who erect the statues
do they ever think?

561
00:49:52,589 --> 00:49:57,060
It will face rain,cyclone
sun & crow droppings

562
00:49:57,594 --> 00:49:59,574
What's this? he's holding umbrella
over a statue

563
00:50:00,597 --> 00:50:02,076
He'll be a big fan of
poet Bharathi

564
00:50:02,265 --> 00:50:03,073
Or he might have drunk

565
00:50:03,433 --> 00:50:07,245
You had written a poem
there's no caste

566
00:50:07,771 --> 00:50:08,579
Where isn't there caste?

567
00:50:08,772 --> 00:50:10,080
Where has the caste disappeared?

568
00:50:10,774 --> 00:50:14,085
I got 78% even then
I didn't get a job

569
00:50:14,444 --> 00:50:15,422
Because of my caste

570
00:50:15,779 --> 00:50:18,259
Before whom should I cry?

571
00:50:18,782 --> 00:50:21,592
You've lived with your poems

572
00:50:21,785 --> 00:50:24,095
If you had applied for a job

573
00:50:24,454 --> 00:50:25,933
Then you would've come to know

574
00:50:26,123 --> 00:50:28,933
You too wouldn't have got
the job

575
00:50:29,292 --> 00:50:30,270
Come,let's see our friend

576
00:50:31,128 --> 00:50:34,940
I know that your family suffered
a lot in poverty

577
00:50:35,132 --> 00:50:36,110
Brother,what are you doing?

578
00:50:36,466 --> 00:50:39,606
What? I'm talking openly
to Bharathi

579
00:50:39,803 --> 00:50:40,781
Okay,let's go...

580
00:50:41,138 --> 00:50:43,118
I should talk more to him

581
00:50:43,807 --> 00:50:51,953
I should ask him whether
he knows

582
00:50:52,149 --> 00:50:54,459
You come,let's go home

583
00:50:54,818 --> 00:50:56,126
Where?-where is your house?

584
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:58,959
House?Do I have a house?

585
00:50:59,656 --> 00:51:02,796
My father sent me out of
that house

586
00:51:03,326 --> 00:51:04,805
Hey! he's of our clan
-he looks like that

587
00:51:04,995 --> 00:51:06,804
House is a small circle

588
00:51:07,164 --> 00:51:10,304
Real circle is outside
the house

589
00:51:10,834 --> 00:51:13,144
I said like that
am I right?

590
00:51:13,336 --> 00:51:15,816
Now whatever you say is right
come lets go out of the circle

591
00:51:16,339 --> 00:51:16,817
Then,I'll come...

592
00:51:17,007 --> 00:51:17,485
Come let's go

593
00:51:18,508 --> 00:51:19,486
Hey! who's laughing?

594
00:51:19,843 --> 00:51:21,322
Bharathi,did you laugh?

595
00:51:32,689 --> 00:51:34,327
News about the missing persons

596
00:51:36,693 --> 00:51:39,003
She's Karpagam,Age 20

597
00:51:39,196 --> 00:51:40,834
Someone like us

598
00:51:42,866 --> 00:51:44,846
She's missing for part
few days

599
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:47,173
Those who give information
about her...

600
00:51:47,537 --> 00:51:50,677
Will be rewarded 1 lakh

601
00:51:51,541 --> 00:51:52,519
We'll repeat...

602
00:51:52,876 --> 00:51:53,854
She's Karpagam

603
00:51:54,211 --> 00:51:55,189
1 lakh for this Karpagam?

604
00:51:55,712 --> 00:51:57,020
Thank God! my photo is not there

605
00:51:57,214 --> 00:51:58,192
It'll be 10 lakhs for your
photo...

606
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:02,530
Now only I come to know
that I am worth Rs 1 lakh

607
00:52:03,553 --> 00:52:04,861
Before someone recognizes us
we'll run away...

608
00:52:12,729 --> 00:52:14,538
It's Kunnur-it's welcoming us

609
00:52:16,566 --> 00:52:19,706
If we get the treasure,we'll
offer Rs 5 to God

610
00:52:19,903 --> 00:52:22,713
you miser...we'll offer Rs 10
to God

611
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:24,548
Then we'll clean shave our heads

612
00:52:29,913 --> 00:52:31,051
What did Swamiji say,tell me

613
00:52:31,248 --> 00:52:32,056
4 letters city(In Tamil)

614
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:34,058
We saw the name board

615
00:52:34,417 --> 00:52:35,225
Hill station

616
00:52:35,752 --> 00:52:36,230
We saw...

617
00:52:36,586 --> 00:52:37,894
Red Box...

618
00:52:41,458 --> 00:52:41,731
Here it is

619
00:52:51,101 --> 00:52:51,579
What's it?

620
00:52:52,202 --> 00:52:52,737
Did you call me?

621
00:52:56,139 --> 00:52:56,583
Greetings

622
00:53:00,477 --> 00:53:01,251
Which City?

623
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:04,588
What are you digging?

624
00:53:04,781 --> 00:53:05,759
Sir,we're digging
underground way

625
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:09,589
Sir,we didn't get a ticket
in anything

626
00:53:09,786 --> 00:53:11,993
So,we're digging here to reach
Madras

627
00:53:12,289 --> 00:53:13,427
We didn't get a place
here also

628
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:14,259
Do you want a place?

629
00:53:15,225 --> 00:53:17,262
Lakhs?...12 lakhs?...

630
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:18,438
Fool!

631
00:53:20,163 --> 00:53:22,109
I should beat myself
by slippers

632
00:53:24,834 --> 00:53:26,939
Don't scratch it too much
Gold may diminish

633
00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:29,609
If I scratch only,we'll know
whether its genuine Gold

634
00:53:29,806 --> 00:53:32,616
Today is Wednesday
very auspicious day

635
00:53:32,976 --> 00:53:36,446
My money will get you
tons of money

636
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:39,961
The first Pawn broker who speaks
Tamil will live long

637
00:53:40,483 --> 00:53:41,120
Look there...

638
00:53:43,253 --> 00:53:44,288
That girl wearing
white colour shirt

639
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:47,463
We've seen this girl on
the T V isn't it?

640
00:53:48,325 --> 00:53:50,305
Red colour...170 cm

641
00:53:51,328 --> 00:53:53,308
That face...do you remember?

642
00:53:53,830 --> 00:53:57,141
It's enough If I see a woman's
face once,do you've a doubt? now see

643
00:54:03,673 --> 00:54:04,481
Who's it?

644
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:06,315
Now,do you've any doubt?

645
00:54:06,509 --> 00:54:07,317
Oh God! let's run away...

646
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:11,488
Look there...they're running like
P.T Usha

647
00:54:41,544 --> 00:54:46,687
Please,don't do anything
we'll give all our money...

648
00:54:49,386 --> 00:54:51,195
All these are just imitations

649
00:54:52,555 --> 00:54:54,364
Please,don't handover me

650
00:55:12,575 --> 00:55:14,054
Each one of us have
a Pathetic story...

651
00:55:15,011 --> 00:55:16,888
Everyone has suffered in
different ways

652
00:55:19,416 --> 00:55:21,396
We're all victims of
injustice

653
00:55:22,018 --> 00:55:23,395
All of us have been driven
to this by desperations

654
00:55:24,587 --> 00:55:25,725
They talk about duty & honour

655
00:55:25,922 --> 00:55:28,562
They educate us to be
honest,efficient & truthful...

656
00:55:29,292 --> 00:55:31,898
But there is lot of difference
between their talk & reality

657
00:55:33,029 --> 00:55:34,235
Everywhere hypocrisy
is there...

658
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:38,745
We all have runaway
from the house...

659
00:55:39,502 --> 00:55:41,243
Now,where we're going to run?
and how we're going to live?

660
00:55:42,038 --> 00:55:43,073
According to me...

661
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,579
Why should I live,and for whom
I should live?

662
00:55:47,377 --> 00:55:50,256
I think that there's no meaning in
living in this bad world

663
00:55:50,447 --> 00:55:51,755
What's the purpose of
dying also?

664
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:56,087
Whether it has solution or not
but it has an end

665
00:55:56,619 --> 00:55:59,099
We all have thought at some time
to commit suicide

666
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:10,776
Now, we'll do that together

667
00:56:11,468 --> 00:56:12,446
Suicide?-yes

668
00:56:24,814 --> 00:56:26,122
Gowtham,I think this is
an escape

669
00:56:26,316 --> 00:56:29,126
If you & I die,will this world
get rid of injustice?

670
00:56:29,486 --> 00:56:30,965
Or will they reform?

671
00:56:31,654 --> 00:56:32,962
Suicide is a kind of
protest

672
00:56:35,024 --> 00:56:37,470
I believe that this will give
awareness to the youngsters

673
00:56:38,161 --> 00:56:40,641
I'm ready there's no
life for me

674
00:56:41,364 --> 00:56:43,139
I ran away from the house
to commit suicide

675
00:56:43,366 --> 00:56:45,642
This is stupidity-
Pasupathi is a coward

676
00:56:46,503 --> 00:56:48,312
This world is in the
hands of youngsters

677
00:56:48,671 --> 00:56:49,979
If you say that we'll
fight injustice

678
00:56:50,173 --> 00:56:53,154
We show our greatness worth

679
00:56:53,510 --> 00:56:54,648
You wear a saree...

680
00:56:56,446 --> 00:56:58,153
First we'll know who all are
interested in committing suicide

681
00:57:13,696 --> 00:57:15,334
Pasupathi,you can go...

682
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:32,518
Friends,I'm not afraid of
death

683
00:57:32,882 --> 00:57:35,522
Death is like sleep
birth is like waking up

684
00:57:35,718 --> 00:57:36,526
So said Thiruvalluvar

685
00:57:36,886 --> 00:57:38,866
Not only death is remedy
for all diseases

686
00:57:39,222 --> 00:57:41,202
As far as I'm concerned
there's no reservations for death

687
00:57:42,725 --> 00:57:48,038
Anyone,with any caste,creed or
religion has access to it

688
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:51,378
But when?

689
00:57:52,235 --> 00:57:53,213
When are we going to
commit suicide

690
00:57:57,740 --> 00:58:00,050
Till this money lasts
let's live together

691
00:58:00,743 --> 00:58:01,551
After that let's die together

692
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:04,553
Brother,can't we spend all this
money in one day itself

693
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:09,721
Then,shall we decided
a date for it?

694
00:58:12,755 --> 00:58:14,393
Shall we stay together for
100 days?

695
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:18,730
At the end of that 100 days
Let's celebrate the 100th day

696
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:19,735
...With our death!

697
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:21,737
What's the date today?

698
00:58:21,998 --> 00:58:23,068
June 25

699
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:33,243
100 days mean...plus...plus...98 days
that means Oct 2nd is the 100th day

700
00:58:34,811 --> 00:58:37,257
What an irony! That is
Gandhiji's birthday!

701
00:58:47,790 --> 00:58:50,100
The 100 days which we are going
to live each minute of it

702
00:58:50,793 --> 00:58:54,935
We must live without any sorrow
happily without any regrets

703
00:58:56,232 --> 00:58:58,769
There shouldn't be anything
personal between us

704
00:59:02,972 --> 00:59:04,110
No fears...No tears!

705
00:59:04,307 --> 00:59:05,445
No memories of past also

706
00:59:06,309 --> 00:59:07,788
No sorrows...No sentiments

707
00:59:08,311 --> 00:59:09,790
No bondages...No relationships

708
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:13,117
We'll enjoy life happily and
then die

709
00:59:15,485 --> 00:59:17,123
Let's live together to
die together

710
00:59:19,322 --> 00:59:21,632
First lets find a obscure
place to live

711
00:59:29,999 --> 00:59:33,469
What Karpagam?shall we change
our decision?

712
00:59:35,004 --> 00:59:36,984
No...don't

713
00:59:38,207 --> 00:59:39,481
Then,why are you crying?

714
01:00:11,874 --> 01:00:16,186
No more sorrows,now
sky is the limit

715
01:00:16,379 --> 01:00:19,849
It isn't any far,now
sky is the limit

716
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:23,030
There are wings to fly
over continents

717
01:00:24,554 --> 01:00:27,364
It'll be better if
we've 2 skys

718
01:00:33,229 --> 01:00:37,200
Singing birds! we're from
the party of living

719
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:19,248
We don't want any relationships
let's go all around the world

720
01:01:19,776 --> 01:01:23,588
No need of rights
let's make a new law

721
01:01:23,946 --> 01:01:28,088
If we've courage,we can
go to the stars

722
01:01:28,284 --> 01:01:32,096
If we've some leisure time
we can stay on moon for some time

723
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:36,265
Like the flying birds we
can go around the world

724
01:01:36,626 --> 01:01:40,438
Like a young girl plucking flowers let's
enjoy the beauty of this world

725
01:01:40,997 --> 01:01:44,274
ls life forever on this earth?

726
01:01:44,967 --> 01:01:47,777
Let's live here on this earth

727
01:02:33,683 --> 01:02:37,153
Let's sell this world and
buy the moon

728
01:02:37,687 --> 01:02:40,998
Let's sell moon and buy
a new sky

729
01:02:42,058 --> 01:02:45,835
Let's sell our sorrows and
buy poetical selections

730
01:02:46,028 --> 01:02:49,999
Let's sell poems and
buy dreams

731
01:02:50,366 --> 01:02:54,007
Let's live as 20 till our
last breath

732
01:02:54,470 --> 01:02:58,350
Let's write poetry on the back
of waiting God of death

733
01:02:58,608 --> 01:03:02,021
No need of any more skirmishes

734
01:03:02,879 --> 01:03:05,860
Let's live,that's our motto now

735
01:03:51,594 --> 01:03:52,732
Hey! you said you'll write poetry
on the back of God of death

736
01:03:52,929 --> 01:03:54,408
...But you're going off writing
it on my back boys

737
01:03:54,597 --> 01:03:55,405
Stop!

738
01:03:56,766 --> 01:03:58,404
Hey! look a To-let board

739
01:04:02,104 --> 01:04:03,242
Hey! A very nice house
for rent

740
01:04:03,439 --> 01:04:04,918
It is obscure as we had wished

741
01:04:27,563 --> 01:04:28,598
It's a red car,okay!

742
01:04:28,798 --> 01:04:31,278
But,didn't that Astrologer say
it's a moving red box

743
01:04:31,467 --> 01:04:32,445
I forgot only that

744
01:04:33,369 --> 01:04:35,940
Forgetting that you made me to
stay in a lock up for a day

745
01:04:36,138 --> 01:04:38,778
Did you notice it? there were 12 bars
one for one lakh

746
01:04:40,142 --> 01:04:42,122
If mother comes to know about this
she'll hang herself to death

747
01:04:42,378 --> 01:04:44,449
Will luck come & knock our door?
we must go in search of it

748
01:04:45,147 --> 01:04:46,626
Hey! look! it's coming our way

749
01:04:50,519 --> 01:04:52,795
Did you see? there's a car!

750
01:04:52,989 --> 01:04:54,127
Yes! A red car!

751
01:04:55,858 --> 01:04:56,962
This is the hidden treasure

752
01:04:57,994 --> 01:05:00,133
Oh! did you see? a red car!

753
01:05:00,396 --> 01:05:01,807
A moving tin box

754
01:05:01,998 --> 01:05:03,807
Luck is locked up in this only!

755
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:05,638
Our luck! It has smiled
on us now

756
01:05:06,669 --> 01:05:07,807
Leave this and look there

757
01:05:08,337 --> 01:05:09,816
A red car! a red van which
is larger?

758
01:05:10,172 --> 01:05:10,980
Do you've any senses?

759
01:05:11,173 --> 01:05:12,811
Will he keep Rs 12 lakhs in such
a small match box like car?

760
01:05:13,009 --> 01:05:13,817
He'll keep in a large van only!

761
01:05:14,010 --> 01:05:15,489
It's our good time! we were about
to be cheated

762
01:05:15,678 --> 01:05:16,486
Catch it! don't leave it

763
01:05:16,679 --> 01:05:19,159
Catch it
-get on to it & catch it

764
01:05:37,033 --> 01:05:38,341
Unknowingly we had entered
please forgive us

765
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:39,337
Please forgive us

766
01:05:46,442 --> 01:05:50,015
Leaving a Royal life living
like a street mongrel

767
01:05:50,212 --> 01:05:51,520
Do you need it?

768
01:05:52,381 --> 01:05:53,018
I need it

769
01:05:53,549 --> 01:05:57,691
Even if we toil all our life
we can't see Rs 1000

770
01:05:58,587 --> 01:06:02,194
Hey! shall we try our
luck to the last?

771
01:06:05,461 --> 01:06:06,030
Hey! look there

772
01:06:09,799 --> 01:06:10,209
Come quickly

773
01:06:13,069 --> 01:06:15,379
Get keys! keys?. ..keys!

774
01:06:15,571 --> 01:06:16,709
Get the car keys quickly
come quickly

775
01:06:17,573 --> 01:06:18,551
Take it!

776
01:06:23,579 --> 01:06:24,717
What's this,it isn't coming
under control for keys

777
01:06:24,914 --> 01:06:26,222
Won't stop for keys

778
01:06:26,615 --> 01:06:29,391
It'll stop for notes only
a rupee note only

779
01:06:34,023 --> 01:06:34,728
Put this into his hand

780
01:06:37,493 --> 01:06:42,238
How much?...it seems to be a Rs 10
do you've only that!

781
01:06:47,937 --> 01:06:49,416
Hey! don't let him go away
whom are you trying to deceive?

782
01:06:51,707 --> 01:06:52,583
Hey! what's your name?

783
01:06:54,443 --> 01:06:55,421
Were you born for Mars?

784
01:06:55,711 --> 01:06:57,418
Are you beating so much
for just Rs 10

785
01:06:57,713 --> 01:06:58,589
Which place are you from?

786
01:07:00,950 --> 01:07:02,258
Sister,I said Bodinaickenur

787
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:05,099
Let's go com promisingly! can you
find us a place for rent?

788
01:07:05,287 --> 01:07:07,767
Ask me like that,I'll
let you a nice bungalow

789
01:07:07,990 --> 01:07:08,764
Your own bungalow?

790
01:07:10,626 --> 01:07:12,606
My bungalow is behind this

791
01:07:12,962 --> 01:07:14,600
I'm the watchman for
my bungalow

792
01:07:15,631 --> 01:07:18,612
Owner of the bungalow comes for
only 10 days in a year

793
01:07:18,801 --> 01:07:21,611
He's owner for that 10 days only
all other days I'm the owner

794
01:07:22,138 --> 01:07:23,446
If you pay me,you can
stay here

795
01:07:24,073 --> 01:07:26,451
A obscure bungalow far away
from the crowds

796
01:07:26,809 --> 01:07:27,446
This is the right place

797
01:07:34,984 --> 01:07:36,964
Hey! Mars! food is excellent

798
01:07:37,086 --> 01:07:39,293
She does it half and rest
I do it!...cooking

799
01:07:40,656 --> 01:07:42,636
Who's that she?I've never
seen her

800
01:07:42,825 --> 01:07:44,304
I've warned to beat her
if she comes out

801
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:44,970
Why?

802
01:07:45,327 --> 01:07:46,305
Three fatso's have come,isn't it?

803
01:07:47,763 --> 01:07:48,798
Why to take risk?

804
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:52,306
Is she your wife?

805
01:07:52,668 --> 01:07:53,305
Yuck! get lost

806
01:07:53,569 --> 01:07:55,480
Without belief on family life

807
01:07:56,672 --> 01:07:57,810
This one is...a concubine

808
01:07:58,574 --> 01:07:59,143
Concubine

809
01:07:59,341 --> 01:08:00,319
She came in search of a job
isn't it?

810
01:08:01,110 --> 01:08:01,986
...I've made her to stay
with me

811
01:08:03,012 --> 01:08:03,490
Like a concubine

812
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:05,656
Didn't you marry her?

813
01:08:06,248 --> 01:08:07,818
I don't have belief
in marriages?

814
01:08:08,050 --> 01:08:08,824
In love?

815
01:08:09,185 --> 01:08:13,156
Love? In films they run
around trees meaninglessly

816
01:08:13,389 --> 01:08:13,992
...Is that you're asking?

817
01:08:15,791 --> 01:08:18,328
Love is humbug! It's
all camera tricks

818
01:08:18,861 --> 01:08:20,499
Yes! he's right

819
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:22,342
Love is useless...meaningless

820
01:08:23,799 --> 01:08:26,177
Love is nothing but a cheating played
by man & woman on each other

821
01:08:28,370 --> 01:08:29,007
Leave me respectfully

822
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:31,677
Leave me! or today you're in
for a shock

823
01:08:31,874 --> 01:08:33,854
Did you ever love anyone?
-I don't need all that

824
01:08:35,211 --> 01:08:36,349
Do you know how divine
love is?

825
01:08:42,218 --> 01:08:42,525
Stop it...

826
01:08:44,153 --> 01:08:44,858
Who's he to talk about love

827
01:08:45,221 --> 01:08:45,858
Who's he to...

828
01:08:48,557 --> 01:08:51,868
Each person may've a different
opinion about love

829
01:08:52,228 --> 01:08:54,538
It depends on their situation and
their maturity

830
01:08:54,830 --> 01:08:56,036
Why are you both fighting
for that?

831
01:08:59,635 --> 01:09:00,705
Can I come to serve food?

832
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:10,220
I'm getting scared of the decision
to stay with them for 100 days

833
01:09:10,913 --> 01:09:12,551
Are you feeling like that after
seeing them fight?

834
01:09:13,582 --> 01:09:15,892
Poor souls! each one has a
sorrow behind him

835
01:09:16,585 --> 01:09:18,394
There's no surprise in seeing a
sorrowful man in anger

836
01:09:18,921 --> 01:09:21,060
Though Gowtham's anger is
giving me jitters

837
01:09:21,991 --> 01:09:26,565
Deepak's pacifying attitude
is giving some peace to me

838
01:09:27,263 --> 01:09:28,571
I don't forsee any trouble

839
01:09:29,798 --> 01:09:30,401
Mad girl!

840
01:09:31,433 --> 01:09:33,913
More than the disgusting experience
we had

841
01:09:34,270 --> 01:09:36,250
Or the decision which
we had taken

842
01:09:37,273 --> 01:09:38,911
...There's nothing more dangerous
to happen to us than these

843
01:09:39,141 --> 01:09:40,586
You mustn't have behaved
so rudely

844
01:09:42,444 --> 01:09:46,415
As far love is concerned...
the experience I had...

845
01:09:47,449 --> 01:09:49,588
...Has made me a hard hearted and
turned me violent

846
01:10:24,853 --> 01:10:25,627
Listen to me

847
01:10:33,495 --> 01:10:34,303
Didn't I tell you

848
01:10:35,331 --> 01:10:38,471
No fears,no tears,no past life memories
no sorrows...no sentiments

849
01:10:38,734 --> 01:10:39,974
No bondages...no relationships

850
01:10:43,005 --> 01:10:45,815
Sir,please,don't register any case
I'm coming right away

851
01:10:48,344 --> 01:10:48,981
What?

852
01:10:49,345 --> 01:10:50,483
Did you see your
daughter's proudness?

853
01:10:50,946 --> 01:10:52,653
She had drunk and created
trouble in a 5 Star Hotel

854
01:10:52,881 --> 01:10:53,985
Now,it seems she's in a
Police lock up

855
01:10:54,183 --> 01:10:55,321
If asked,it seems she's saying
I'm daughter of M R T

856
01:10:56,285 --> 01:10:57,992
Did you drink?-yes!

857
01:10:59,521 --> 01:11:02,502
I drank,so that M R T will
lose his honour

858
01:11:02,958 --> 01:11:04,164
Did you create trouble
after drinking?

859
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:08,831
Yes,I created trouble so that
M R T will lose his honour

860
01:11:09,231 --> 01:11:12,007
Why are you embarrassing me by
calling yourself as M R T's daughter?

861
01:11:12,901 --> 01:11:16,007
I m doing all this so that
M R T will lose his honour

862
01:11:16,305 --> 01:11:17,340
Are you my daughter?

863
01:11:23,712 --> 01:11:24,690
You tell me...

864
01:11:28,384 --> 01:11:33,527
This big man M R T married
my mother...

865
01:11:34,723 --> 01:11:39,035
I am the only daughter
of my Mother

866
01:11:40,829 --> 01:11:45,039
Then,am I MRT's daughter or not?

867
01:11:46,302 --> 01:11:47,042
You tell me!

868
01:11:48,070 --> 01:11:48,548
Yes!

869
01:11:48,904 --> 01:11:49,848
Is this fair on your part?

870
01:11:50,506 --> 01:11:51,746
Didn't you betray me?

871
01:11:52,608 --> 01:11:56,613
Shall I reveal his secrets

872
01:11:57,379 --> 01:11:58,380
Sir,where should I sign?

873
01:12:00,749 --> 01:12:01,819
First release her!

874
01:14:24,226 --> 01:14:26,035
Hey,I don't know swimming

875
01:14:26,495 --> 01:14:27,200
Throw him into the basket

876
01:14:53,922 --> 01:15:00,703
T-E-R-R-O-R-I-S-T

877
01:15:08,337 --> 01:15:13,980
50 DAYS MORE TO TOUCH THE SKY

878
01:15:16,812 --> 01:15:17,882
Have you seen my exercise body?

879
01:15:18,814 --> 01:15:20,225
Why do a person,who is going to die
needs body building?

880
01:15:20,415 --> 01:15:21,917
Are you going to Wrestle with
God of Death?

881
01:15:22,117 --> 01:15:22,595
Hey,go!

882
01:15:23,252 --> 01:15:24,925
Gowtham,come here

883
01:15:27,623 --> 01:15:28,260
Hold this ladder

884
01:15:29,925 --> 01:15:31,905
What are you going to do?
Why are you climbing up?

885
01:15:32,294 --> 01:15:34,001
Today is August 15th,independence Day

886
01:15:34,463 --> 01:15:35,100
I am going to hoist the flag

887
01:15:35,464 --> 01:15:37,102
Yuck!Did you call me for this?
I'm going

888
01:15:50,112 --> 01:15:50,783
Then what?

889
01:15:51,346 --> 01:15:52,950
Indian?!...independence Day?

890
01:15:55,617 --> 01:15:57,290
Why do,a dying person wants to
Celebrate Independence Day?

891
01:15:57,486 --> 01:15:58,362
We're alive today,isn’t' it?

892
01:15:58,820 --> 01:16:00,231
Till we're alive,we're Indians

893
01:16:00,822 --> 01:16:02,392
After death,Are we Late Indians?

894
01:16:04,893 --> 01:16:07,965
Indian?...Stupid,I don't
believe all these

895
01:16:08,297 --> 01:16:11,039
Even in death,die like an Indian
Don't die as a traitor

896
01:16:11,333 --> 01:16:13,904
It shown interest to keep his
body trim,but not his heart

897
01:16:14,369 --> 01:16:15,279
Even I don't believe

898
01:16:15,771 --> 01:16:16,841
Even I support Gowtham's opinion

899
01:16:17,306 --> 01:16:18,979
What's so great about Indians?

900
01:16:19,341 --> 01:16:22,720
The 4 rogues,gang who raped me
in Train,were all Indians

901
01:16:27,382 --> 01:16:27,951
No Subhadra!

902
01:16:29,851 --> 01:16:31,956
Thinking about the fated incident
happened to you personally

903
01:16:33,855 --> 01:16:35,163
We shouldn't generalise and
talk disparagingly

904
01:16:37,693 --> 01:16:45,009
It's the mistake of these 44 years
which failed to inspire patriotism in us

905
01:16:45,434 --> 01:16:47,414
That's the main reason for all the
problem of our Country

906
01:16:49,838 --> 01:16:54,844
Since,you were born as a son
to a wicked,you've become cynical

907
01:16:55,444 --> 01:16:56,684
And not because of you're an Indian

908
01:16:58,280 --> 01:16:59,190
Feel proud to be an Indian

909
01:17:12,594 --> 01:17:19,876
Oh Mother,who gave me birth
My Golden Husband..

910
01:17:20,602 --> 01:17:29,386
He died & what'll I do now?

911
01:17:29,578 --> 01:17:30,556
Why have you'll become sad
out of sudden?

912
01:17:31,446 --> 01:17:33,323
The elegy which is being
heard from somewhere

913
01:17:33,982 --> 01:17:35,086
ls upsetting us

914
01:17:35,817 --> 01:17:36,727
If you get scared for
so small elegy

915
01:17:39,321 --> 01:17:42,234
Singing about the dead by others
is known as Elegy

916
01:17:43,392 --> 01:17:46,396
Has anyone sing about
their death by dying?

917
01:17:47,429 --> 01:17:49,409
Has anyone sung about
its importance?

918
01:17:49,931 --> 01:17:53,572
They haven't sung?Because
everyone are scared about it

919
01:17:54,102 --> 01:17:57,413
Then,I feel,you'll are scared

920
01:17:57,773 --> 01:18:00,310
Not like that,Really,..No...

921
01:18:00,976 --> 01:18:03,923
Then,shall we sing about
our death?

922
01:18:04,846 --> 01:18:05,551
Who'll compose a tune?

923
01:18:06,281 --> 01:18:10,252
Let's sing & dance happily &
Rejoice at our coming death

924
01:18:10,452 --> 01:18:11,328
Let's sing in this metre

925
01:18:11,586 --> 01:18:14,157
Metre?...he can't even think on
his own!He's talking about metres

926
01:18:14,990 --> 01:18:17,095
I'll compose a tune
Bring the Harmonium(music instrument)

927
01:19:34,102 --> 01:19:37,606
It's the tune to sing
National Anthem

928
01:19:37,839 --> 01:19:41,377
It's the time,where
Birth & Death meets

929
01:19:41,643 --> 01:19:47,685
I took the clouds and
imprinted it on my heart

930
01:19:48,717 --> 01:19:52,187
Let's jump in joy
why should we cry?

931
01:19:52,454 --> 01:19:58,530
Thanking the world,let's quit it

932
01:20:39,901 --> 01:20:40,845
This world can't bear it
What'll happen to it?

933
01:20:41,436 --> 01:20:44,417
If the life's coming into
this world don't die

934
01:20:45,841 --> 01:20:48,947
If the earth doesn't revolve..

935
01:20:49,211 --> 01:20:54,251
We won't be able to breathe
What're we going to do them?

936
01:20:55,283 --> 01:20:58,492
If time comes,anything can happen

937
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:02,493
When time comes,the wings
of the Birds will help it to fly

938
01:21:02,757 --> 01:21:05,931
The time,when the
sky invites us..

939
01:21:06,428 --> 01:21:09,602
Let the Parrots fly away

940
01:21:10,131 --> 01:21:16,946
Let music reverberate the air
Where's the path?

941
01:21:17,138 --> 01:21:21,780
Look its there!....there!

942
01:21:24,713 --> 01:21:27,956
This life is like a prison life

943
01:21:28,183 --> 01:21:33,132
These spiders caught in the
web,are asking freedom

944
01:22:14,062 --> 01:22:17,339
Like the Rain drop when it
reaches Earth

945
01:22:17,532 --> 01:22:22,675
The death brought with rain
will it take our lifes to the sky?

946
01:22:23,405 --> 01:22:26,852
The flowing rivers which
reach seas

947
01:22:27,042 --> 01:22:32,185
Will the sea object to the
death of a River?

948
01:22:32,881 --> 01:22:36,351
The Nature has taught us
to converge

949
01:22:36,584 --> 01:22:39,861
The world is still existing with
this convergence only

950
01:22:40,422 --> 01:22:43,562
Like the water,that
accumulates in the Valley

951
01:22:44,192 --> 01:22:47,696
Let's merge with Nature

952
01:22:48,063 --> 01:22:54,378
Let's conquer the Directions
Where's the path?

953
01:22:54,970 --> 01:22:59,282
Look,its there...there

954
01:23:02,143 --> 01:23:05,716
Freedom is here,where is it?

955
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:10,693
Where's the man,who can reply
our question?

956
01:24:04,139 --> 01:24:06,449
Hey!Buddy,why should we
still be afraid of Police?

957
01:24:06,641 --> 01:24:09,281
But that drama man bargained
too much

958
01:24:09,477 --> 01:24:10,956
Will we get anything without
toiling for it?

959
01:24:11,312 --> 01:24:12,791
We're searching Rs.12 lakhs
Treasure,isn't it?

960
01:24:14,983 --> 01:24:16,462
Is he also coming in search
of the treasure?

961
01:24:16,985 --> 01:24:18,794
Oh!He's a real Police

962
01:24:20,321 --> 01:24:22,801
Shall we run away?
-Run away?

963
01:24:22,991 --> 01:24:24,299
Let's talk to him or else
he may think bad about us

964
01:24:24,492 --> 01:24:26,972
Correct man!We must talk
without getting excited

965
01:24:27,162 --> 01:24:27,970
What to talk?

966
01:24:28,163 --> 01:24:30,973
Shall we start,what rates are prevailing
for ldli & Dosa in your place?

967
01:24:31,166 --> 01:24:32,304
Yuck!you're showing your
Hotel background

968
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:33,137
What's there to talk?

969
01:24:33,334 --> 01:24:35,314
Shall we do one thing?Shall we tell
that we've come for security duty?

970
01:24:35,503 --> 01:24:37,312
Whose security?
-Our security only

971
01:24:38,673 --> 01:24:39,811
Greetings brother!

972
01:24:40,008 --> 01:24:42,147
Which place?-We've come from Madras
on Security duty

973
01:24:42,343 --> 01:24:43,151
For CM's security!

974
01:24:43,511 --> 01:24:44,819
CM has gone to Delhi,isn't it?

975
01:24:46,181 --> 01:24:47,819
He never made paper

976
01:24:48,016 --> 01:24:50,496
That isn't CM,we've come for
the security of PM

977
01:24:50,852 --> 01:24:51,990
PM is on a foreign tour

978
01:24:54,522 --> 01:24:55,660
Why blabber unknown things?

979
01:24:55,857 --> 01:24:57,666
Take it!...Village hit!

980
01:25:01,029 --> 01:25:04,340
As far as we're concerned,we ran
away from home for personal problems

981
01:25:04,699 --> 01:25:07,339
But,you come out for an Aim

982
01:25:07,535 --> 01:25:09,344
All our deceptions were personal

983
01:25:12,874 --> 01:25:14,854
More than everything that proud
feeling of Indian.

984
01:25:15,210 --> 01:25:17,850
I liked you your patriotism

985
01:25:18,046 --> 01:25:20,185
Then,am I after you like
an school teacher?

986
01:25:27,388 --> 01:25:29,698
What man?when're you going to
commit suicide?

987
01:25:34,562 --> 01:25:35,870
Affections!

988
01:25:38,233 --> 01:25:40,042
What's the meaning of affection?
What's Love?

989
01:25:44,072 --> 01:25:44,550
Both are same

990
01:25:45,406 --> 01:25:48,546
They're dirtying the
word LOVE,isn't it?

991
01:25:48,743 --> 01:25:50,552
Oh!That's way,have you
written it has affection?

992
01:25:51,746 --> 01:26:00,393
I've developed...without
my knowledge on you...

993
01:26:01,089 --> 01:26:07,904
I don't know whether it's
right or wrong?

994
01:26:11,933 --> 01:26:15,073
I think it is Wong
The breeze has swept it

995
01:26:17,272 --> 01:26:18,410
The breeze doesn't know to read

996
01:26:18,773 --> 01:26:20,582
If it knows,it would'nt
have swept it

997
01:26:22,277 --> 01:26:23,756
May be the breeze doesn't
know Tamil?

998
01:26:42,297 --> 01:26:43,275
Enough!Stop the Video camera

999
01:26:47,802 --> 01:26:49,281
Why do the dying need
entertainment

1000
01:26:53,641 --> 01:26:56,451
You only made a Law,no relationship
no bondages,no sentiments

1001
01:26:56,644 --> 01:26:58,783
You were a love failure,so only
you're so cynical

1002
01:26:58,980 --> 01:27:00,118
Now,what's wrong in it?

1003
01:27:00,815 --> 01:27:02,453
Have I hugged her
or kissed her?

1004
01:27:02,650 --> 01:27:04,789
You've started Loving her
What's the meaning of it?

1005
01:27:05,653 --> 01:27:08,634
To pass away time,I video graphed her
is it Love?

1006
01:27:09,157 --> 01:27:11,467
Then what?we shouldn't give
a place for weakness?

1007
01:27:11,826 --> 01:27:13,965
Such weaknesses will always be
a hurdle for our decisions

1008
01:27:14,162 --> 01:27:15,470
Who are you to advice me?

1009
01:27:15,663 --> 01:27:15,970
What?

1010
01:27:16,664 --> 01:27:17,642
Who am I to advice you?

1011
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,810
Are you the only one to advice?
ls advicing your monopoly right?

1012
01:27:22,337 --> 01:27:24,647
Do you consider yourself to be...
What do you think of yourself?

1013
01:27:31,346 --> 01:27:32,154
Peace. . . . peace

1014
01:27:32,680 --> 01:27:36,321
No regrets...no tears..no memories of old life
No bondages..no affections

1015
01:27:36,517 --> 01:27:37,825
No sorrows...no sentiments

1016
01:27:38,019 --> 01:27:39,828
There wasn't a condition
of no Love

1017
01:27:40,188 --> 01:27:41,667
Think it as platonic Love

1018
01:27:42,190 --> 01:27:43,168
Get up boys

1019
01:27:43,524 --> 01:27:45,663
We'll have a very short life

1020
01:27:45,860 --> 01:27:47,840
He'll Love till then,Leave him

1021
01:27:58,206 --> 01:28:01,346
Pls. everyone,tell about
your wishes

1022
01:28:01,542 --> 01:28:03,021
It can be even a
silly thing,please tell

1023
01:28:03,211 --> 01:28:03,689
Who's first?

1024
01:28:03,878 --> 01:28:04,686
I'll tell first

1025
01:28:05,046 --> 01:28:09,859
I want 100 man to be lined and
slap each one of them!

1026
01:28:12,720 --> 01:28:13,698
Do you know my wish?

1027
01:28:16,557 --> 01:28:19,538
What did he say?
-Hey! don't tell him!

1028
01:28:19,727 --> 01:28:22,867
He wants to roam all over
city in nude

1029
01:28:26,067 --> 01:28:27,705
Shall we take a photo

<i>Silly...Silly!</i>

1034
01:28:37,578 --> 01:28:40,058
It isn’t anything sillier than
roaming naked!

1035
01:28:40,248 --> 01:28:41,886
Bhanupriya is on Ooty only for
a film shooting

1036
01:28:53,428 --> 01:28:54,736

Yes! we're going to kidnap you!

1044
01:29:20,121 --> 01:29:20,929
There's no other way!

1045
01:29:21,956 --> 01:29:24,266
Not unnecessary commotion!
Then,your life will be in danger

1046
01:29:24,792 --> 01:29:26,430
There's a gun behind your back!

1047
01:29:31,299 --> 01:29:33,609
Madam,everything will be
like it comes in your films

1048
01:29:34,302 --> 01:29:36,782
You must come smiling!

1052
01:30:07,502 --> 01:30:09,140
We're are not murderer
or dacoits!

1053
01:30:09,504 --> 01:30:11,484
We're not extremists!
we're pitiable souls

1054
01:30:11,839 --> 01:30:13,477
Innocents! victims of injustice

1055
01:30:13,674 --> 01:30:14,812
We were chased away by failures!

1056
01:30:16,010 --> 01:30:17,990
There are only 45 days left
in our life!

1057
01:30:20,148 --> 01:30:20,819
Now,what do you want?

1058
01:30:21,182 --> 01:30:22,160
Nothing! simple!

1059
01:30:22,517 --> 01:30:25,361
You dance for 5 crores people!
Now,you must dance for 5 fans

1060
01:30:27,688 --> 01:30:29,497
Forgive us for forcibly
bringing you here

1061
01:30:29,690 --> 01:30:30,498
...Forgive us!

1062
01:30:33,528 --> 01:30:34,836
Just only one dance for us!

1063
01:30:36,697 --> 01:30:38,506
We'll take you back safely!

1064
01:30:41,202 --> 01:30:42,681
Oh! Are you afraid of this?

1065
01:30:53,548 --> 01:30:55,357
What do you think of yourselves?
This is unjust!

1066
01:30:55,550 --> 01:30:57,188
Just because,she's an actress
you could take any liberties?

1067
01:30:58,219 --> 01:31:00,199
Poor girl!How much hurt
she may've felt?

1068
01:31:00,388 --> 01:31:00,866
What?

1069
01:31:01,055 --> 01:31:02,363
Is this a way to behave
with a girl?

1070
01:31:02,890 --> 01:31:03,527
Don't you've any manners?

1071
01:31:03,891 --> 01:31:05,199
Did you bring her at
pistol point?

1072
01:31:05,893 --> 01:31:06,701
Will she come if we ask her?

1073
01:31:06,894 --> 01:31:08,032
Will the Peacock give its feather,if we ask it?

1074
01:31:08,729 --> 01:31:09,537
There's a limit for everything!

1075
01:31:09,730 --> 01:31:10,708
Stop it...Stop it!

1076
01:36:01,188 --> 01:36:02,667
Thank you very much!

1077
01:36:02,857 --> 01:36:04,165
I want to give you some prize

1078
01:36:05,192 --> 01:36:06,170
What's that you don't have?

1079
01:36:06,360 --> 01:36:07,668
This's what I can afford..
Rs 10!

1080
01:36:07,862 --> 01:36:09,842
This's not just Rs 10! This's
equal to 10,000 gold coins

1081
01:36:10,197 --> 01:36:12,336
A fan's prize from the
deeper of his heart!

1082
01:36:12,533 --> 01:36:13,011
Take it!

1083
01:36:15,536 --> 01:36:18,016
The couplet written on that
note is priceless

1084
01:36:18,706 --> 01:36:23,678
"The visible of her two eyes's
one's diseased & other is Medicine to cure"

1085
01:36:24,044 --> 01:36:24,681
Understood?

1086
01:36:29,049 --> 01:36:31,859
Any day,anytime,if you get
a second free!

1087
01:36:32,887 --> 01:36:34,867
...Think about these sweet rascals!

1088
01:36:41,395 --> 01:36:42,703
She is a fine lady,isn't it?

1089
01:36:43,230 --> 01:36:44,538
What may be the cost of
that dress?

1090
01:36:45,566 --> 01:36:47,705
We're killing our hunger by
taking Tea!

1091
01:36:48,235 --> 01:36:49,543
Now,we don't have money
to buy Tea also“

1092
01:36:49,904 --> 01:36:51,212
Shall we go back?..No...No

1093
01:36:51,572 --> 01:36:54,052
Let's try our luck here

1094
01:36:55,576 --> 01:36:57,715
Look,a man is coming! shall we
make him to cough out some money?

1095
01:36:58,245 --> 01:36:59,053
Stop!

1096
01:36:59,580 --> 01:37:00,888
What do you want constable?

1097
01:37:01,582 --> 01:37:03,892
They've given a license to
ride on roads only

1098
01:37:04,251 --> 01:37:05,889
You're riding it on mountains
What's the matter?

1099
01:37:06,253 --> 01:37:07,891
You're paying Road tax only
Are you paying tax for mountains?

1100
01:37:08,422 --> 01:37:10,060
Do you've a token for the
payment of tax? -Why?

1101
01:37:10,424 --> 01:37:12,062
Are you trying over run us?
You must pay tax for these vehicle

1102
01:37:12,259 --> 01:37:12,737
Where's the token?

1103
01:37:13,594 --> 01:37:14,402
There's no token...no token...

1104
01:37:15,095 --> 01:37:15,732
Isn't there? -No!

1105
01:37:15,930 --> 01:37:16,567
I'll run him down!

1106
01:37:16,764 --> 01:37:17,902
There's no tax for this vehicles

1107
01:37:19,767 --> 01:37:20,905
From today,they've changed
the rules

1108
01:37:21,101 --> 01:37:21,738
Did you read today's newspaper?

1109
01:37:21,936 --> 01:37:24,246
You can't escape from court citing
that you don't know the rules

1110
01:37:24,605 --> 01:37:26,243
If you go to magistrate
he'll fine you Rs 300!

1111
01:37:26,440 --> 01:37:26,918
Yes!

1112

01:37:36,116 --> 01:37:36,594
I don't have any money with me..

1115
01:37:36,951 --> 01:37:38,089

01:37:40,621 --> 01:37:42,931
I'm the Ooty;
Superintendent of Police

1118
01:37:45,125 --> 01:37:47,105
I lied to them!
They're run away like this

1119
01:37:49,463 --> 01:37:51,443
Dear,I got an idea
all of a sudden

Why can't,that 4 letter
town be Kunnur?

1121
01:37:54,969 --> 01:37:57,950
Yes! I left it,thinking it
a 3 letter word! Coonur!

1122
01:37:58,973 --> 01:38:00,111
They call it as Kunnur!

1123
01:38:01,809 --> 01:38:02,787
It is a 4 letter word!

1124
01:38:03,310 --> 01:38:05,119
...You remember it at
right time!

1125
01:38:05,646 --> 01:38:07,125
I'm going to Ooty to attend
a marriage

1126
01:38:07,481 --> 01:38:09,461

1127
01:38:15,990 --> 01:38:17,298
She's rug mother!

What? No one should smoke?

1149
01:39:20,721 --> 01:39:21,199
Why?

1150
01:39:21,722 --> 01:39:22,700
Nowadays,your rule is

Poor fellows!

1163
01:39:52,920 --> 01:39:57,733
You're not searching for
money where it's

1164
01:40:02,096 --> 01:40:05,566
And you're searching where
it's not found

Hey,why's it weighing?
Very heavy

1187
01:40:49,977 --> 01:40:50,785
Don't know what's there in this box?

1188
01:40:51,812 --> 01:40:52,790
It may have a corpse

1189
01:40:53,147 --> 01:40:54,285
They might've locked it up
with a corpse

1190
01:40:55,816 --> 01:40:56,453
Don't get scared

1191
01:40:57,151 --> 01:40:57,788
It may have even tools

1192
01:40:58,485 --> 01:40:59,964
Tools will rattle when its shaken

1193
01:41:00,487 --> 01:41:02,797
Or else my driver might be going
out of station

1194
01:41:03,157 --> 01:41:04,465
So he may have packed us
clothes in this

1195
01:41:05,826 --> 01:41:07,464
There's no car,why do
we need this box?

1196
01:41:07,828 --> 01:41:08,636
Shall we throw this?

1197
01:41:08,996 --> 01:41:09,474
Throw it immediately

1198
01:41:14,168 --> 01:41:16,148
Hey,wait,let's see
what's inside

1199

1200
01:41:29,016 --> 01:41:29,994
Hey,why are you breaking it?

1201
01:41:30,517 --> 01:41:31,154
Where have you stolen it from?

1202
01:41:31,852 --> 01:41:32,489
This is our box

1203
01:41:33,020 --> 01:41:33,828
I'll break your knees

1204
01:41:34,188 --> 01:41:35,166
If its yours,why do you break it?

1205
01:41:35,522 --> 01:41:36,159
Key is missing

1206
01:41:36,356 --> 01:41:36,834
What's inside?

1207
01:41:37,357 --> 01:41:37,994
Don't know!

1208
01:41:38,525 --> 01:41:39,503
You're claiming that's yours

1209
01:41:39,860 --> 01:41:41,168
Yet you don't know,what's inside?

1210
01:41:41,361 --> 01:41:41,839
I'll break your knees

1211
01:41:42,362 --> 01:41:43,340
Are you all playing the fool?

1212
01:41:43,864 --> 01:41:44,842
Come to the Police station

1213
01:41:53,207 --> 01:41:53,685
Are we going to the
Police Station?

1214
01:41:53,874 --> 01:41:55,182
We'll take 5-10 & send them

1215
01:41:55,542 --> 01:41:56,350
Hey,where are they?

1216
01:41:58,545 --> 01:42:00,024
They ran away by taking us to be
real Policemen

1217
01:42:00,714 --> 01:42:02,022
They ran away by handing
over this box to us

1218
01:42:02,549 --> 01:42:04,187
Hey,you're running away
leaving the box

1219
01:42:04,718 --> 01:42:05,856
They are cowards!

1220
01:42:06,553 --> 01:42:07,861
Why do we need unnecessary
trouble?

1221
01:42:08,055 --> 01:42:08,533
Lift the box

1222
01:42:09,556 --> 01:42:10,534
We'll handover this to them

1223
01:42:12,226 --> 01:42:15,366
Brothers...our brothers

1224
01:42:18,732 --> 01:42:19,710
Hey poor fellows

1225
01:42:20,234 --> 01:42:23,704
Leaving the real place,& searching
for it where it isn't found

1226
01:42:26,073 --> 01:42:29,543
Leaving the obvious place
you're searching the money elsewhere

1227
01:42:29,910 --> 01:42:32,390
You all are roaming everywhere
unnecessarily

1228
01:42:32,746 --> 01:42:34,225
Intelligent Brothers!

1229
01:42:35,749 --> 01:42:40,220
My intelligent brothers
I am here only

1230
01:42:41,922 --> 01:42:45,563
Is it my fault that
I am illegitimate money

1231
01:42:48,095 --> 01:42:51,406
Should I be a prisoner for a
life long,if I am illegitimate?

1232
01:42:51,665 --> 01:42:53,406
Brother. . . Brother...

1233
01:42:54,268 --> 01:42:57,738
Will the deceived tax money
be invaluable?

1234
01:42:58,105 --> 01:43:01,575
Will the money got as
a price of dog,bark?

1235
01:43:10,951 --> 01:43:13,261
Policemen didn't see my
face properly

1236
01:43:13,787 --> 01:43:15,266
We would've got caught nicely

1237

What brother?

We wouldn't have questioned you?

1242
01:43:33,473 --> 01:43:36,113
Before we could find you

Oh! may be it's from Bhanupriya?
Only she knows our address!

There's a book mark to see
page No:91!

1263
01:45:00,060 --> 01:45:01,869
Do you know the greatness
of life?

1264
01:45:02,062 --> 01:45:03,871
Do you know the greatness of
man's wishes?

1265
01:45:04,398 --> 01:45:05,706
Hey! Man who's trying to quiet
this earth!

01:45:06,066 --> 01:45:07,704
This earth let you down

1267
01:45:08,235 --> 01:45:10,215
Did Air breezed
leaving you alone?

1268
01:45:10,737 --> 01:45:13,377
Did the moon stop it's light
to fall on you only?

1269
01:45:13,907 --> 01:45:16,387
The life is welcoming you to
reside on it's high points!

1270
01:45:16,910 --> 01:45:19,550
Why're you digging a Death valley
with your nails?

1271
01:45:20,414 --> 01:45:21,222
I must enlighten you about
virtues of Life

1272
01:45:21,415 --> 01:45:22,223
I must enlight you about
virtues of life!

1273
01:45:22,749 --> 01:45:23,557
Arise!Come behind me

1274
01:45:23,750 --> 01:45:24,228
Arise! come behind me!

1275
01:45:24,584 --> 01:45:28,396
Look there on old man,half-died
carrying on with half life'?

1276
01:45:29,589 --> 01:45:30,397
Look there,on old man,though half died
carrying on with half life?

1277
01:45:30,590 --> 01:45:30,897
Why?

1278
01:45:31,091 --> 01:45:31,569
Why?

1279
01:45:31,758 --> 01:45:33,897
Why is the Medical fraternity
fighting death parlsely?

1280
01:45:34,761 --> 01:45:35,899
Why is the medical fraternity
fighting death falsely?

1281
01:45:36,263 --> 01:45:36,570
Brother!
Let death decide about death

1282
01:45:36,763 --> 01:45:38,572
Brother!
Let death decide about death!

1283
01:45:38,932 --> 01:45:40,240
You decide about life

1284
01:45:41,435 --> 01:45:42,743
It's fire till it burns

1285
01:45:42,936 --> 01:45:44,415
Its earth till it rotates
& revolves

1286
01:45:44,604 --> 01:45:44,911
You're man till you fight

1287
01:45:45,439 --> 01:45:45,917
Try to understand

1288
01:45:46,106 --> 01:45:46,914
You're a man

1289
01:45:47,107 --> 01:45:48,586
Whose work it might be?

1290
01:45:49,276 --> 01:45:50,755
What an excellent poetry!

1291
01:45:51,445 --> 01:45:53,083
Deepak,have a look at the
handwriting of the address

1292
01:45:53,780 --> 01:45:55,418
It appears to be God sent

1293
01:45:55,949 --> 01:45:57,087
Is it a woman's hand writing?

1294
01:45:57,617 --> 01:45:58,755
Even Poet Bharathi had said...

1295
01:45:59,119 --> 01:46:01,429
Death,I consider you as a child

1296
01:46:01,788 --> 01:46:02,766
Come near my feet Boy

1297
01:46:02,956 --> 01:46:04,264
I'll stamp on you

1298
01:46:04,624 --> 01:46:06,262
It's foolishness to
commit suicide

1299
01:46:06,460 --> 01:46:09,100
How forcefully the poet
has said that.

1300
01:46:12,799 --> 01:46:14,608
We've found who had sent it

1301
01:46:14,801 --> 01:46:15,939
By your handwriting

1302
01:46:18,638 --> 01:46:20,777
Yes!Let's alter our decision

1303
01:46:23,310 --> 01:46:24,288
Hey!Go girlie

1304
01:46:42,162 --> 01:46:45,803
What's this,you're staring
at the car?

1305
01:46:46,166 --> 01:46:48,305
I feel I've familiar with
this car

1306
01:46:48,502 --> 01:46:51,483
I've hired it from Kunnur Garage
for the procession

1307
01:46:52,339 --> 01:46:52,817
Is it?

1308
01:47:23,203 --> 01:47:25,843
What's this?Pattabhi is
getting consecrated?

1309
01:47:26,706 --> 01:47:29,186
That's what I'm surprised?
He rarely bath's

1310
01:47:33,547 --> 01:47:36,187
What's so important?
Getting a facelift!

1311
01:47:38,385 --> 01:47:39,193
Come on tell...!

1312
01:47:40,053 --> 01:47:41,361
Come on tell without feeling shy

1313
01:47:41,555 --> 01:47:42,693
Today,its my birthday

1314
01:47:43,056 --> 01:47:44,034
Rascal,why didn't you
tell earlier itself?

1315
01:47:50,063 --> 01:47:52,373
How'll I've another birthday
in the remaining 30 days?

1316
01:47:54,901 --> 01:47:57,040
Will sell this Herald Car?
Whose vehicle is this?

1317
01:47:57,237 --> 01:47:59,217
Whose car it may be
What's your price?

1318
01:48:00,574 --> 01:48:02,053
My price is Rs.25,000\-

1319
01:48:02,242 --> 01:48:04,051
Sir,our price is Rs.50,000\-
-Okay done!

1320
01:48:07,247 --> 01:48:08,726
You can't have it below Rs.65,000

1321
01:48:09,416 --> 01:48:13,387
Okay!My time isn't in the best of times
I'll take it for Rs.65,000

1322
01:48:13,587 --> 01:48:16,067
You can take it now itself
after paying in cash

1323
01:48:24,598 --> 01:48:25,906
Sir,look the tools are here

1324
01:48:26,433 --> 01:48:27,411
Sir,why're you going away?

1325
01:48:27,601 --> 01:48:28,238
I don't want the car

1326
01:48:29,436 --> 01:48:30,744
Why don't you want?

1327
01:48:31,104 --> 01:48:31,912
Hey!Take off your hands

1328
01:48:32,105 --> 01:48:32,913
You had settled on the price
isn't it?

1329
01:48:41,114 --> 01:48:43,094
Look!I've bought a New shirt
for your Birthday

1330
01:48:44,784 --> 01:48:45,922
Where's the birthday boy?

1331
01:48:46,119 --> 01:48:46,927
I've not seen him for a long time

1332
01:48:47,120 --> 01:48:48,098
What's this man,you say you
didn't see him

1333
01:48:48,288 --> 01:48:50,097
He isn't seen since you left
for shopping

1334
01:48:52,959 --> 01:48:56,099
My son's name is Pasupathi
Today its his birthday

1335
01:48:56,630 --> 01:48:58,109
His birth star is Avittam
-Yes sir

1336
01:48:59,966 --> 01:49:02,276
What's this man?Even Pasupathi's
Hat is also missing

1337
01:49:02,469 --> 01:49:04,107
Where would he have gone
with a hat?

1338
01:49:18,151 --> 01:49:20,131
Hey!Look there!Pasupathi's Hat

1339
01:49:43,843 --> 01:49:44,981
How did this come here?

1340
01:49:46,179 --> 01:49:47,817
Then,I think he might've
brought it here

1341
01:49:49,015 --> 01:49:50,653
Pasupathi video graphed something

1342
01:49:51,017 --> 01:49:52,496
Let watch it

1343
01:50:10,537 --> 01:50:11,345
Greetings!

1344
01:50:11,538 --> 01:50:14,348
I'm standing in front of the Camera
after switching it on myself

1345
01:50:14,541 --> 01:50:15,849
To talk with you

1346
01:50:16,376 --> 01:50:18,515
My hands are shivering
Am I feeling Camera shy?

1347
01:50:19,879 --> 01:50:23,190
So afraid to face a camera
How're we going to face death?

1348
01:50:23,383 --> 01:50:26,193
For our 100th day,only 30 days
are remaining

1349
01:50:27,220 --> 01:50:31,362
I'll tell you in short I
nodded affirmatively for your decision

1350
01:50:32,392 --> 01:50:34,372
...Thinking that I could convince
you later on

1351
01:50:34,561 --> 01:50:35,699
But now I feel it's impossible

1352
01:50:35,895 --> 01:50:38,535
So,I'm going to give you a shock
treatment & after your decision

1353
01:50:40,734 --> 01:50:44,204
I've decided to save your lives
staking my life

1354
01:50:45,572 --> 01:50:48,052
You'll understand only then
the value of Life

1355
01:50:53,913 --> 01:50:56,052
I asked Lord Ganesha
If I'm doing right?

1356
01:50:56,416 --> 01:50:59,397
Lord Ganesha said for the good
of others,you can die

1357
01:51:00,920 --> 01:51:04,561
Lord Ganesha,I'm doing this with your
encouragement only,save my friends

1358
01:51:04,758 --> 01:51:05,736
Don't pull the rug beneath me!

1359
01:51:07,927 --> 01:51:09,406
I wanted to say something
isn't it?

1360
01:51:10,096 --> 01:51:12,906
Yes,a word for legal problems

1361
01:51:13,266 --> 01:51:15,246
No one is responsible
for my death

1362
01:51:17,103 --> 01:51:18,912
I wished to make a movie..

1363
01:51:19,105 --> 01:51:20,743
Now,I'm filming my own death

1364
01:51:20,940 --> 01:51:25,082
Story,Dialogue,Direction,Acting
Photography everything by me...

1365
01:51:25,445 --> 01:51:26,423
Howzzhat?

1366
01:51:30,617 --> 01:51:32,927
Lord!Don't think I'm pulling
your leg

1367
01:51:33,787 --> 01:51:35,095
Just for recognition only

1368
01:51:36,289 --> 01:51:40,431
Do you know,there's only one
step between Life & death

1369
01:51:41,127 --> 01:51:43,266
If a step is put forward
its life

1370
01:51:43,463 --> 01:51:46,273
If a step is put behind
its death

1371
01:53:08,214 --> 01:53:10,023
If you don't tear of dates from
the calender

1372
01:53:10,216 --> 01:53:11,354
Will the days stop from moving?

1373
01:53:13,720 --> 01:53:14,698
Whom are you trying
to cheat?

1374
01:53:14,888 --> 01:53:16,697
Or trying to cheat
yourselves?

1375
01:53:18,725 --> 01:53:21,535
Still there are only 23 days
left for our 100th Day

1376
01:53:22,562 --> 01:53:25,372
Hey!when are you going to
commit suicide?

1377
01:53:26,232 --> 01:53:30,374
Lord Ganesha,I'm going with your
encouragement only!Save my friends

1378
01:53:34,073 --> 01:53:36,212
I was planning to talk with
you about that only

1379
01:53:36,576 --> 01:53:37,554
What's there to talk about?

1380
01:53:38,244 --> 01:53:38,722
No!

1381
01:53:39,746 --> 01:53:43,717
We are pondering over whether to
honour our decision taken already

1382
01:53:44,751 --> 01:53:46,230
After the death of Pasupathi?

1383
01:53:46,419 --> 01:53:46,897
What?

1384
01:53:47,420 --> 01:53:48,398
Are you thinking?

1385
01:53:50,590 --> 01:53:52,399
I feel some treachery is being
planned here

1386
01:53:52,926 --> 01:53:55,236
We had decided together
to die

1387
01:53:55,595 --> 01:53:56,733
After his death

1388
01:53:56,930 --> 01:53:59,911
If we decide to live,that
is nothing but cheating

1389
01:54:00,266 --> 01:54:02,405
It's a treachery against him

1390
01:54:03,102 --> 01:54:05,412
Don't become cowards

1391
01:54:06,606 --> 01:54:09,746
Think about his intention
-you ask your conscience

1392
01:54:10,944 --> 01:54:14,255
Gowtham,don't be angry
Think calmly

1393
01:54:15,114 --> 01:54:16,252
If we decide to die

1394
01:54:16,950 --> 01:54:19,089
Then his death won't be
meaningful,isn't it?

1395
01:54:19,452 --> 01:54:21,090
If we continue to live
even after his death

1396
01:54:21,287 --> 01:54:22,425
Then our lives will
be meaningless

1397
01:54:23,456 --> 01:54:24,093
You say,subathra

1398
01:54:27,961 --> 01:54:30,942
Gowtham's is right
-Even I feel that's right

1399
01:54:33,299 --> 01:54:34,437
We shouldn't abandon it

1400
01:54:34,634 --> 01:54:36,272
He doesn't have the hope
which you girls have

1401
01:54:39,639 --> 01:54:40,777
You be a black sheep

1402
01:54:43,977 --> 01:54:45,957
There's no need for us to
wait for 23 days

1403
01:54:46,312 --> 01:54:47,120
We'll break the shackles

1404
01:55:32,525 --> 01:55:33,162
Where have you brought
this Baby from?

1405
01:55:33,693 --> 01:55:34,330
Whose Baby is this?

1406
01:55:34,861 --> 01:55:35,669
Yes,it's a Baby

1407
01:55:36,362 --> 01:55:37,170
Baby was lying in the
garbage

1408
01:55:37,864 --> 01:55:38,842
You went out in anger

1409
01:55:39,032 --> 01:55:40,511
But while returning,you've brought
the baby now

1410
01:55:40,867 --> 01:55:42,005
I had no choice

1411
01:55:42,201 --> 01:55:44,340
Oh!it's like...went out for
stroll came back with poem

1412
01:55:45,038 --> 01:55:46,517
This Baby's mother had thrown
it in the garbage

1413
01:55:47,206 --> 01:55:49,516
And it was crying alone

1414
01:55:50,209 --> 01:55:53,019
We decided to throw away our Burden
But you've brought this burden

1415
01:55:54,213 --> 01:55:55,521
Why are you troubling us
like this?

1416
01:55:56,382 --> 01:55:59,363
Whenever he comes back,He's loaded
with unnecessary troubles

1417
01:55:59,719 --> 01:56:00,356
What Deepak?

1418
01:56:00,720 --> 01:56:03,860
After finding the Baby in the garbage
How could he leave it there?

1419
01:56:06,559 --> 01:56:07,697
Could I've handed it over
to the Police

1420
01:56:08,061 --> 01:56:09,039
For that,should you bring
it here?

1421
01:56:09,228 --> 01:56:10,206
What are you asking me to do now?

1422
01:56:11,064 --> 01:56:12,372
Shall we kill the child &
bury it?

1423
01:56:32,752 --> 01:56:40,898
Are you God,because you don't
have parents

1424
01:56:42,428 --> 01:56:46,740
Dear,even I belong to
your category

1425
01:56:47,433 --> 01:56:51,176
I don't have any relations

1426
01:56:53,439 --> 01:56:57,410
Dear,why do you cry?
I am like your uncle

1427
01:56:58,444 --> 01:57:02,586
Since,the earth sheltered you
you're the son of Mother Earth

1428
01:57:34,814 --> 01:57:38,956
You're the New Indian who doesn't
know your Mother tongue

1429
01:57:39,819 --> 01:57:42,959
That isn't a lie

1430
01:57:44,824 --> 01:57:49,136
You're living without specifying
your caste

1431
01:57:50,096 --> 01:57:52,975
But the Country isn't living
like you

1432
01:57:55,501 --> 01:58:00,143
You're smiling sweetly

1433
01:58:00,506 --> 01:58:04,977
You're looking at me & seeking
for a place in my heart

1434
01:58:05,511 --> 01:58:09,653
We can sing lullaby for you
to grow

1435
01:58:10,516 --> 01:58:14,828
But the only draw back is,we can't
feed you milk

1436
01:58:15,855 --> 01:58:19,997
If we tell your sorrows
your burden will be lessened

1437
01:58:20,860 --> 01:58:25,002
if we tell our sorrows
you'll lose your sleep

1438
01:59:33,266 --> 01:59:41,412
Gathering clouds sing lullaby
for the sky

1439
01:59:43,276 --> 01:59:51,593
The withering flower sings lullaby
for the Sun

1440
01:59:53,953 --> 01:59:58,595
When the time for the journey to
death was to commence

1441
01:59:59,125 --> 02:00:03,596
You kissed me & made me
to worry

1442
02:00:03,963 --> 02:00:08,275
Are you a boon
or bane in my life?

1443
02:00:08,968 --> 02:00:13,280
Is thorn,a enemy or a
relative for rose?

1444
02:00:14,307 --> 02:00:18,278
Because of your bad time,
you've come here

1445
02:00:19,312 --> 02:00:23,454
Your sorrows have combined
with our sorrows

1446
02:01:06,692 --> 02:01:13,507
Look here,Look at this toy,dear

1447
02:01:14,200 --> 02:01:16,009
Have you all decided to run a
family here permanently?

1448
02:01:18,204 --> 02:01:19,342
Only 18 days more

1449
02:01:19,705 --> 02:01:22,345
You should have thought about this
before bringing the child here

1450
02:01:24,877 --> 02:01:25,685
Then,what about our
decision?

1451
02:01:26,212 --> 02:01:27,691
Sir,even I'll ask you the
same question?

1452
02:01:27,880 --> 02:01:28,517
Shall We kill the child?

1453
02:01:29,715 --> 02:01:32,195
We should live till the child
stays with us

1454
02:01:34,887 --> 02:01:37,527
The child is on our hands
Our decision is with the child

1455
02:01:49,402 --> 02:01:50,881
I've searched everywhere
child is missing

1456
02:01:51,070 --> 02:01:53,209
What?child is missing
from when?

1457
02:01:53,406 --> 02:01:54,214
Child is missing from
morning

1458
02:01:54,407 --> 02:01:55,715
Has anyone kidnapped the
child?

1459
02:02:01,914 --> 02:02:02,551
Did you see the child?

1460
02:02:04,083 --> 02:02:05,221
Hey,did you see the child?

1461
02:02:07,753 --> 02:02:08,891
I left the child where I had
found him?

1462
02:02:09,088 --> 02:02:12,228
In that garbage?
-Yes

1463
02:02:13,092 --> 02:02:14,571
I've done that,so that our
decision should stand

1464
02:02:15,261 --> 02:02:17,400
You Rascal
-Hey leave my shirt

1465
02:02:17,763 --> 02:02:19,572
Come,let's bring the child back

1466
02:02:19,765 --> 02:02:20,573
Why are you holding my
shirt?

1467
02:02:20,933 --> 02:02:21,570
Hey,leave my shirt

1468
02:02:21,767 --> 02:02:22,575
Are you an animal or
a human being?

1469
02:02:23,436 --> 02:02:25,245
Suppose the child dies due to rain
How we're going to save him?

1470
02:02:27,773 --> 02:02:29,582
Hey take your things & get out

1471
02:02:29,775 --> 02:02:31,083
Who are you to send me out?

1472
02:02:32,278 --> 02:02:33,916
Hereafter don't see me,-Is this your property?

1473
02:02:52,131 --> 02:02:53,269
What is it that belongs to you in
this house?

1474
02:02:53,799 --> 02:02:54,937
This is your trunk
Isn't it?

1475
02:02:56,302 --> 02:02:57,440
Take this also & leave

1476
02:03:01,474 --> 02:03:02,953
Hey,are you asking
me to leave?

1477
02:04:00,032 --> 02:04:02,842
My son Babu,was working
here

1478
02:04:03,202 --> 02:04:05,842
He took his brother with him
to search treasure

1479
02:04:06,205 --> 02:04:08,185
Both of them haven't returned yet

1480
02:04:08,874 --> 02:04:11,684
Please look at that & tell me
Are my sons alive?

1481
02:04:12,545 --> 02:04:16,516
They are fine,madam,now,they are
with 15 people

1482
02:04:17,550 --> 02:04:19,530
Now they are talking happily
together

1483
02:04:20,553 --> 02:04:24,194
It's a big car,And they're going
happily in that

1484
02:04:37,570 --> 02:04:39,049
I'll give you a tablet,
Then you'll feel better

1485
02:04:43,576 --> 02:04:44,384
Why are you crying?

1486
02:04:47,246 --> 02:04:48,224
Karpagam,look at me

1487
02:04:49,582 --> 02:04:53,223
Tell me!
-I am too Nervous

1488
02:04:54,253 --> 02:04:56,062
I couldn't express it

1489
02:05:00,426 --> 02:05:01,564
I am scared

1490
02:05:34,293 --> 02:05:35,271
I had no other way...

1491
02:05:36,295 --> 02:05:37,933
I am not interested in
changing my decision

1492
02:05:38,631 --> 02:05:40,269
I don't like to betray
Pasupathi

1493
02:05:40,966 --> 02:05:41,774
Why did you save me?

1494
02:05:42,234 --> 02:05:47,274
No,Gowtham,We should live
or die together

1495
02:05:50,976 --> 02:05:52,284
First,we must do something
for the child

1496
02:05:57,650 --> 02:05:58,628
Was it in the garbage?

1497
02:06:00,986 --> 02:06:05,628
I've seen you both somewhere
-even we're like orphans!

1498
02:06:09,495 --> 02:06:10,473
Now,I got it

1499
02:06:11,330 --> 02:06:15,642
Where are your masks?
-Everything is torn...

1500
02:06:16,335 --> 02:06:19,475
You're showing so much concern for the
child found in the garbage

1501
02:06:20,005 --> 02:06:21,313
I don't know how to
thank you all

1502
02:06:21,674 --> 02:06:23,984
You've given shelter for
so many orphans

1503
02:06:25,344 --> 02:06:26,652
We should worship
you as Goddess

1504
02:06:28,013 --> 02:06:30,493
No...no...All those thanks
belongs to Mr.Gandhiraman

1505
02:06:34,687 --> 02:06:37,998
He's the founder & organiser
of the convent

1506
02:06:39,358 --> 02:06:41,668
You said by wearing masks
you're trying to live as Mahatmas...

1507
02:06:42,528 --> 02:06:43,836
But as it's,he's leading his
life like them

1508
02:07:18,731 --> 02:07:19,209
Who are you?

1509
02:07:23,902 --> 02:07:25,711
Who are you?
-What bothers you?

1510
02:07:29,408 --> 02:07:30,045
Your wife?

1511
02:07:34,079 --> 02:07:34,716
2 wives?

1512
02:07:38,083 --> 02:07:38,891
I am asking,who are
you?

1513
02:07:39,084 --> 02:07:40,722
Why are you entering
without replying?

1514
02:07:44,923 --> 02:07:46,402
I came to meet watchman Chevvaai

1515
02:07:47,426 --> 02:07:49,064
He has gone to leave
his wife to her native place

1516
02:07:50,929 --> 02:07:52,067
That's very important

1517
02:07:53,599 --> 02:07:54,407
Sir,what do you need now?

1518
02:07:54,600 --> 02:07:56,739
Sir,I came here without
knowing the situation

1519
02:07:57,102 --> 02:07:59,241
Can I stay here for a day?

1520
02:07:59,605 --> 02:08:00,913
You can't! There is no place for
you to stay here

1521
02:08:01,440 --> 02:08:02,578
Sir,there are 4
Bedrooms here

1522
02:08:03,108 --> 02:08:04,746
No sir
-What to do?

1523
02:08:07,780 --> 02:08:09,760
Shall I sleep underneath
this piano?

1524
02:08:10,115 --> 02:08:11,423
Look Deepak,like the bear entered
while praying

1525
02:08:13,452 --> 02:08:15,762
Sir,even you've come to
increase our burden

1526
02:08:16,455 --> 02:08:17,593
Who are you? what's
your name?

1527
02:08:17,790 --> 02:08:19,098
My name is"Half Pandiyan"

1528
02:08:22,127 --> 02:08:23,606
Why half? where's the
remaining half?

1529
02:08:23,962 --> 02:08:25,771
Have you brothers dissected
Pandiyan into 2 halves

1530
02:08:29,802 --> 02:08:32,282
Who are you?
-We're the kings of this place

1531
02:08:34,807 --> 02:08:38,118
We're the relatives of the
house owner

1532
02:08:38,477 --> 02:08:39,114
Are you understood?

1533
02:08:40,646 --> 02:08:43,286
Okay,who are you?
-Who is this bear?

1534
02:08:47,653 --> 02:08:52,966
I am the...owner..
for this house

1535
02:09:00,332 --> 02:09:03,142
What friends? where
are you all going?

1536
02:09:03,836 --> 02:09:07,807
Sir,forgive us,we're leaving
-No...No..That won't work here

1537
02:09:09,508 --> 02:09:12,318
On my entry,if you leave
I won't agree

1538
02:09:12,845 --> 02:09:14,984
I won't accept
-No sir...we...

1539
02:09:15,180 --> 02:09:16,659
We'll talk about that later
first,get in

1540
02:09:16,849 --> 02:09:18,157
It's very cold,outside

1541
02:09:21,854 --> 02:09:24,494
We've stayed in your house for
3 months & made it filthy

1542
02:09:24,857 --> 02:09:26,495
Sir,you never spoke
harshly to us

1543
02:09:26,692 --> 02:09:28,831
That's my weakness
I won't get angry

1544
02:09:31,196 --> 02:09:32,266
I'll laugh like this for
everything

1545
02:09:41,874 --> 02:09:44,013
"His devices injure himself"
What to do?

1546
02:09:44,543 --> 02:09:46,352
Mother & the daughter
has the same luck

1547
02:09:47,546 --> 02:09:50,857
For you,marriage didn't materialise
for me,love didn't materialize

1548
02:09:51,884 --> 02:09:54,865
But one thing,After the death
of my step-father

1549
02:09:55,220 --> 02:09:56,528
I became the daughter of an original
poor beggar

1550
02:09:57,556 --> 02:09:59,536
But you're the millionaire
widow

1551
02:10:01,894 --> 02:10:05,535
If you're MRT's wife,you stay
here & enjoy this property

1552
02:10:06,565 --> 02:10:10,536
Or if you're Suguna's mother
come with me

1553
02:10:59,284 --> 02:10:59,921
What are you looking at?

1554
02:11:01,954 --> 02:11:03,934
I thought that this month
has 31 days

1555
02:11:04,957 --> 02:11:06,095
September has only 30 days

1556
02:11:08,460 --> 02:11:10,440
Have you taken one more day
in your account

1557
02:11:15,300 --> 02:11:20,272
Aren't you afraid of Death?
-No...

1558
02:11:21,640 --> 02:11:25,110
Why? -I've already died

1559
02:11:32,651 --> 02:11:33,629
We've come to the
final stage

1560
02:11:34,152 --> 02:11:35,961
Even this Pandiyan keeps on
questioning us?

1561
02:11:36,655 --> 02:11:38,635
I was scared whether he may
find out our plan

1562
02:11:39,324 --> 02:11:41,964
Deepak,this is the last night
we're going to live

1563
02:11:42,828 --> 02:11:43,306
We must celebrate it

1564
02:11:45,998 --> 02:11:48,478
He has torn many papers as
if he was writing a love letter

1565
02:11:49,001 --> 02:11:49,809
Okay,I'll read it,listen

1566
02:11:50,669 --> 02:11:51,977
This is our Death Announcement

1567
02:11:52,671 --> 02:11:55,652
This is the shock treatment given
to the society by youngsters

1568
02:12:00,679 --> 02:12:03,489
Let this sorrowful incident become
popular throughout the world

1569
02:12:06,685 --> 02:12:08,323
The great man who were the
cause for this

1570
02:12:08,687 --> 02:12:09,495
Let this incident make
them to think

1571
02:12:12,357 --> 02:12:13,995
let this society reform by this

1572
02:12:18,030 --> 02:12:20,670
We'll send this to the press
after everyone signs it

1573
02:12:23,368 --> 02:12:25,678
There's a post box in this park
Karpagam sign this

1574
02:12:27,706 --> 02:12:30,346
I won't sign,I don't like
to die

1575
02:12:30,709 --> 02:12:31,847
Why are you changing the
previous decision?

1576
02:12:32,377 --> 02:12:34,357
The decision are been
changed in the world itself

1577
02:12:34,713 --> 02:12:36,021
I want to live

1578
02:12:36,548 --> 02:12:38,858
I want to live,I want to live

1579
02:12:39,718 --> 02:12:43,689
I won't die
leave me

1580
02:12:47,392 --> 02:12:48,200
Leave me

1581
02:12:57,069 --> 02:12:58,047
Please,help me

1582
02:13:00,405 --> 02:13:01,884
Okay,shall we go to
our guest house?

1583
02:13:02,074 --> 02:13:03,212
Then,we'll decide about
this judiciously

1584
02:13:04,242 --> 02:13:05,220
There is nothing to decide

1585
02:13:06,745 --> 02:13:07,723
Help me

1586
02:13:08,914 --> 02:13:11,895
This is the park,Don't create
a scene here

1587
02:13:12,084 --> 02:13:13,722
First,let's go to the
guest house,come

1588
02:13:19,091 --> 02:13:20,229
Why is it dark?

1589
02:13:20,926 --> 02:13:21,563
Are lights not working?

1590
02:13:22,594 --> 02:13:23,572
Fuse must've blown
power failure

1591
02:13:24,096 --> 02:13:25,404
Karpagam,Are you here
-I am here

1592
02:13:25,931 --> 02:13:26,568
Laughter is heard

1593
02:13:26,765 --> 02:13:27,743
Sir,where are you?

1594
02:13:28,100 --> 02:13:30,239
Find the place by
tracing my laughter

1595
02:13:30,435 --> 02:13:31,413
Sir,Don't you've
torch?

1596
02:13:31,770 --> 02:13:33,078
I should find out where it is
Isn't it?

1597
02:13:33,438 --> 02:13:34,075
I am searching for it

1598
02:13:34,439 --> 02:13:36,077
One friend has come to
meet you

1599
02:13:36,441 --> 02:13:37,749
He's an elderly person

1600
02:13:40,112 --> 02:13:40,920
He's here for past
1/2 an hour

1601
02:13:41,446 --> 02:13:43,255
As soon as he entered,there
was a power failure

1602
02:13:43,448 --> 02:13:44,927
As if he has removed
the fuse

1603
02:13:46,451 --> 02:13:47,429
I got it

1604
02:13:48,120 --> 02:13:48,928
The person who had
come

1605
02:13:49,121 --> 02:13:50,259
No...Torch light

1606
02:13:52,457 --> 02:13:54,266
Sir,Hold it like that

1607
02:13:55,460 --> 02:13:56,438
Who can it be?

1608
02:13:59,131 --> 02:14:00,269
What's this unnecessary trouble?

1609
02:14:00,966 --> 02:14:02,104
Sir,where is he,now?

1610
02:14:02,300 --> 02:14:03,438
I don't know where
he's now

1611
02:14:03,969 --> 02:14:05,448
Sir,As soon as he
came he might've slept

1612
02:14:05,971 --> 02:14:06,779
His voice is not heard
at all

1613
02:14:12,978 --> 02:14:14,116
My name is Samivel Mudaliar

1614
02:14:14,646 --> 02:14:16,626
It seems my son Pasupathi is
with you

1615
02:14:16,982 --> 02:14:17,619
Is he available now?

1616
02:14:25,991 --> 02:14:26,799
Answer me

1617
02:14:30,829 --> 02:14:31,807
Where is my son,Pasupathi?

1618
02:14:35,333 --> 02:14:36,812
How did you come to know
this place?

1619
02:14:37,335 --> 02:14:40,316
I am teaching Tamil literature
to Banupriya

1620
02:14:40,839 --> 02:14:44,651
When she asked the meaning of
Thirukural written on Rs.10

1621
02:14:45,010 --> 02:14:46,819
Then only,She came to know
Pasupathi is my son

1622
02:14:47,345 --> 02:14:49,484
After that,I came to
know that he's here

1623
02:14:49,848 --> 02:14:51,828
Where? Where's my son?

1624
02:14:53,685 --> 02:14:57,155
He had run away from the house
because he didn't get a job

1625
02:15:00,358 --> 02:15:01,996
Now,he has got a job
in the T.V.Station

1626
02:15:04,863 --> 02:15:06,171
I must give this
order to him

1627
02:15:07,699 --> 02:15:08,177
Where's my son,Pasupathi?

1628
02:15:11,036 --> 02:15:11,844
Where's he?

1629
02:15:14,539 --> 02:15:15,347
Why should we be afraid?

1630
02:15:15,874 --> 02:15:20,687
I'll tell him,he's dead

1631
02:15:21,046 --> 02:15:24,357
Dead? What are you
saying?

1632
02:15:26,551 --> 02:15:27,529
He's my only son

1633
02:15:29,554 --> 02:15:30,862
My Pasupathi has died?

1634
02:15:32,557 --> 02:15:33,194
When?

1635
02:15:35,060 --> 02:15:35,697
When?

1636
02:15:37,562 --> 02:15:40,202
How did he die? Tell me

1637
02:15:41,733 --> 02:15:44,043
He committed suicide by
jumping into the river

1638
02:15:44,402 --> 02:15:45,039
Was it suicide?

1639
02:15:46,571 --> 02:15:49,552
We all had decided to die

1640
02:15:50,075 --> 02:15:52,385
But he...He has done
it earlier

1641
02:15:52,744 --> 02:15:56,385
Did he commit suicide on his
own or you've killed him?

1642
02:15:57,749 --> 02:15:59,387
Are you all happy
after his death?

1643
02:16:00,085 --> 02:16:00,563
Rogues!

1644
02:16:01,586 --> 02:16:05,056
We all had decided to
die together

1645
02:16:05,423 --> 02:16:09,394
He had done this to
change our mind

1646
02:16:10,095 --> 02:16:11,574
Put on the video
cassette & show him

1647
02:16:12,097 --> 02:16:16,409
Did you all decide to leave
this world together?

1648
02:16:17,602 --> 02:16:19,081
Why did you all
decide like this?

1649
02:16:20,605 --> 02:16:21,583
What are your difficulties?

1650
02:16:21,940 --> 02:16:23,578
Failure

1651
02:16:24,109 --> 02:16:24,917
Hatred in life

1652
02:16:25,277 --> 02:16:26,255
Who doesn't face
failure?

1653
02:16:26,611 --> 02:16:27,589
Hatred is everywhere

1654
02:16:28,113 --> 02:16:29,751
Life is full of success
& failures

1655
02:16:30,448 --> 02:16:31,256
You don't know anything

1656
02:16:31,616 --> 02:16:33,095
We're afflicted persons

1657
02:16:33,451 --> 02:16:35,431
Except failure,we didn't
achieve anything in life

1658
02:16:35,620 --> 02:16:37,099
What great life you
all have lead?

1659
02:16:37,455 --> 02:16:39,935
Why do you've the feeling of
renunciation at this young age?

1660
02:16:40,458 --> 02:16:43,439
How many times have you fought
against Tyranny & failure?

1661
02:16:44,296 --> 02:16:45,934
Nothing can be easily achieved in
this world

1662
02:16:46,464 --> 02:16:48,444
The youngsters of this generation are
shying away from hard work

1663
02:16:48,800 --> 02:16:49,778
You are all hesitating
to struggle

1664
02:16:49,968 --> 02:16:50,105
You all are escaping from
responsibility

1665
02:16:51,803 --> 02:16:55,444
You all are expecting to achieve
success without toiling

1666
02:16:57,642 --> 02:16:58,950
We gave you lives

1667
02:16:59,477 --> 02:17:02,287
By deceiving & torturing us
with sorrows

1668
02:17:02,814 --> 02:17:04,794
What rights do you've to
sacrifice your life?

1669
02:17:04,983 --> 02:17:06,792
Your saying that we don't have
rights to sacrifice our lives

1670
02:17:07,485 --> 02:17:08,964
Have you given any chance
for us to live?

1671
02:17:09,654 --> 02:17:10,462
If a son love anyone-

1672
02:17:10,989 --> 02:17:11,967
You'll talk about Caste

1673
02:17:12,157 --> 02:17:13,966
You'll give importance
to Status

1674
02:17:14,159 --> 02:17:15,297
Does life means only love?

1675
02:17:16,161 --> 02:17:18,641
Should we sacrifice our lives
because of failure in love?

1676
02:17:18,997 --> 02:17:22,308
They'll say that time is
valuable

1677
02:17:22,667 --> 02:17:24,647
But you all are prepared
to sacrifice your lives

1678
02:17:25,337 --> 02:17:28,648
After leaving your people you're
living like a family

1679
02:17:28,840 --> 02:17:30,979
According to your sense of justice
Is this your argument?

1680
02:17:31,176 --> 02:17:31,984
Yes sir

1681
02:17:33,011 --> 02:17:35,821
We were living as a family
for 3 months

1682
02:17:36,181 --> 02:17:41,995
Even once on any day,have they
misbehaved with us?

1683
02:17:43,688 --> 02:17:44,996
No sir...No...

1684
02:17:45,690 --> 02:17:50,161
One night,during the train journey
4 people have...

1685
02:17:54,699 --> 02:17:59,671
Those who have done that injustice
are above 45 years

1686
02:18:01,873 --> 02:18:03,181
If we express our thoughts

1687
02:18:03,375 --> 02:18:04,854
You'll say that our customs have
been violated

1688
02:18:05,210 --> 02:18:07,520
You people believe in Astrology &
superstitions

1689
02:18:07,712 --> 02:18:09,191
And spoil the young girls life

1690
02:18:09,381 --> 02:18:11,190
You must fight those
injustices

1691
02:18:11,549 --> 02:18:12,857
Only youngsters,like us should
fight

1692
02:18:13,051 --> 02:18:15,031
But...elderly parents like you

1693
02:18:15,220 --> 02:18:16,358
Won't participate in anything

1694
02:18:16,721 --> 02:18:19,861
Your life ends with all
sorts of speeches

1695
02:18:20,392 --> 02:18:24,033
Your adamancy doesn't understand
youngsters dreams,aims & desires

1696
02:18:24,229 --> 02:18:25,537
How many lives are ruined because
of this?

1697
02:18:26,231 --> 02:18:28,541
You're preaching Gita to
youngsters

1698
02:18:28,733 --> 02:18:30,713
But,how many of you,are
following them?

1699
02:18:31,069 --> 02:18:32,047
Our responsibility is to
study

1700
02:18:32,404 --> 02:18:34,213
Our responsibility is to take care
of you all,we agree

1701
02:18:34,572 --> 02:18:36,381
But,educated people are not geting
the job

1702
02:18:36,741 --> 02:18:37,879
They are not getting the chance
to earn

1703
02:18:38,410 --> 02:18:42,222
Everywhere,there's bribe,poverty &
selfishness

1704
02:18:42,580 --> 02:18:44,059
What steps have you taken to
abolish them?

1705
02:18:44,249 --> 02:18:45,057
What steps are you going
to take?

1706
02:18:50,088 --> 02:18:51,066
What am I going
to do?

1707
02:18:51,423 --> 02:18:54,233
I am going to take revenge from you
all for my son's death

1708
02:18:54,426 --> 02:18:55,905
Sir,you needn't worry about that

1709
02:18:56,094 --> 02:18:57,732
We won't give you any
trouble

1710
02:18:57,929 --> 02:19:00,409
We don't like to live happily
after letting your son die

1711
02:19:00,598 --> 02:19:02,407
We're prepared to die at this
moment

1712
02:19:02,767 --> 02:19:03,404
Come,let's go

1713
02:20:11,669 --> 02:20:14,980
Don't get scared,I'm not a ghost
but Pasupathi

1714
02:20:16,674 --> 02:20:17,482
Forgive me

1715
02:20:20,345 --> 02:20:23,155
In the beginning,I thought my death
would change your mind

1716
02:20:23,515 --> 02:20:27,156
But,suppose that results in any
calamity,so out of fear

1717
02:20:27,352 --> 02:20:28,831
I sought my father's help

1718
02:20:37,862 --> 02:20:39,000
You rogue

1719
02:20:44,369 --> 02:20:47,350
The decision to live happily for
100 days before committing suicide

1720
02:20:47,539 --> 02:20:48,517
Was our first mistake

1721
02:20:48,873 --> 02:20:51,353
My son's intelligence has
fructified

1722
02:20:51,709 --> 02:20:53,188
There are ambitions in life

1723
02:20:53,545 --> 02:20:56,355
When they are frustrated,
we resort to suicide

1724
02:20:56,548 --> 02:20:59,529
In lndia,every 8 seconds,they try to
commit suicide

1725
02:20:59,717 --> 02:21:00,525
Statistics says that

1726
02:21:00,885 --> 02:21:02,865
But in 80 seconds,only one
is successful

1727
02:21:03,221 --> 02:21:05,360
With that,think that
you've failed

1728
02:21:06,891 --> 02:21:08,529
Your drama can be believable

1729
02:21:08,893 --> 02:21:10,201
But don't think,that
drama ended successfully

1730
02:21:10,562 --> 02:21:12,542
Why are you harping on the
same subject?

1731
02:21:15,066 --> 02:21:17,876
Poor fellows! They're wishing for it
Let them commit suicide

1732
02:21:23,575 --> 02:21:26,385
But before that,I wish that they
should meet my friend

1733
02:21:26,578 --> 02:21:27,215
Who's he?

1734
02:21:27,579 --> 02:21:31,220
Is he a Politician,Scientist,Saint
Philosopher or an incarnation

1735
02:21:31,416 --> 02:21:31,894
Who's he?

1736
02:21:32,250 --> 02:21:35,720
More than them...But,he's an
ordinary human being

1737
02:21:43,595 --> 02:21:46,235
Greetings children - Greetings
Greetings

1738
02:21:58,443 --> 02:21:59,421
There,he has come

1739
02:21:59,777 --> 02:22:01,085
He's the tablet for
frustrated people

1740
02:22:01,279 --> 02:22:02,257
He's the tonic for
self-confidence

1741
02:22:26,304 --> 02:22:27,612
GANDHIRAMAN PRIMARY SCHOOL

1742
02:22:29,307 --> 02:22:30,115
GANDHIRAMAN HOSPITAL

1743
02:22:31,976 --> 02:22:32,613
GANDHIRAMAN HOME FOR BLIND

1744
02:22:42,153 --> 02:22:43,131
Greetings

1745
02:22:43,821 --> 02:22:47,132
Mr.Gandhiraman sacrificed his life for
the uplift of Society

1746
02:22:47,325 --> 02:22:50,795
Ms.Sundari,sacrificed her
life for her brother

1747
02:22:58,836 --> 02:23:01,146
Shouldn't we be ashamed
after looking at them?

1748
02:23:01,506 --> 02:23:02,985
I didn't achieve anything great

1749
02:23:03,174 --> 02:23:04,983
It'll be enough,if a person
has self confidence

1750
02:23:05,176 --> 02:23:06,314
If we try,we can
achieve wonders

1751
02:23:10,682 --> 02:23:12,491
Pandiyan told me about
you people

1752
02:23:13,017 --> 02:23:14,655
There may be many drawbacks

1753
02:23:14,852 --> 02:23:18,664
Anyhow,this human birth is
a big boon for us

1754
02:23:20,692 --> 02:23:21,670
Can we waste this?

1755
02:23:22,860 --> 02:23:25,500
Failures & Deceit is just
an obstacles

1756
02:23:25,697 --> 02:23:29,167
We should overcome these obstacles
& achieve success

1757
02:23:37,208 --> 02:23:38,687
Mr.Gandhiraman has
enlightened us

1758
02:23:39,043 --> 02:23:42,684
He made us to realise the
virtues of life

1759
02:23:44,048 --> 02:23:46,358
Mr.Gandhiraman,drag them all
to this place

1760
02:23:46,551 --> 02:23:48,030
Give them some job here

1761
02:23:48,219 --> 02:23:49,027
There's lot of work

1762
02:23:49,220 --> 02:23:52,030
I've bought that land which is
adjacent to the compound wall

1763
02:23:52,390 --> 02:23:54,870
I am going to extend the school
& kindergarten

1764
02:23:55,059 --> 02:23:56,868
Let them take part in
that effort

1765
02:24:05,236 --> 02:24:07,045
We'll demolish the Barriers
of inferiority Complex!

1766
02:24:07,405 --> 02:24:09,385
We'll demolish the
Myth of impossibility!

1767
02:24:09,741 --> 02:24:12,551
We'll abandon those obstacles which
are faced by human beings

1768
02:24:13,077 --> 02:24:15,387
We won't rest in peace till we
achieve something in life

1769
02:24:16,080 --> 02:24:16,888
This is a promise!

1770
02:24:33,598 --> 02:24:36,078
It's Fire,till it burns
It's Earth,till it Revolves

1771
02:24:36,267 --> 02:24:39,908
You're the Human being,till you struggle!
