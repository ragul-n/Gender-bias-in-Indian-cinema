00:02:00,762 --> 00:02:01,602
Hello..

2
00:02:01,722 --> 00:02:03,802
Hello.. Good afternoon Mr. Headley.

3
00:02:04,482 --> 00:02:07,082
Did you get the pictures
of the property that I sent?

4
00:02:08,402 --> 00:02:09,522
Yes, I did.

5
00:02:10,962 --> 00:02:13,882
And I must say I love what I am seeing.

6
00:02:14,922 --> 00:02:16,122
Good job.

7
00:02:16,762 --> 00:02:18,042
I told you sir.

8
00:02:18,842 --> 00:02:22,082
Now tell me, what is the price
tag that you can put on your love?

9
00:02:23,282 --> 00:02:26,522
Love has no price tag, Bhavesh.

10
00:02:28,962 --> 00:02:31,722
Love has no price tag.

11
00:02:32,882 --> 00:02:34,202
This is India Lodge.

12
00:02:34,602 --> 00:02:37,442
When the newspapers would
print articles about freedom..

13
00:02:37,642 --> 00:02:39,322
..this construction belongs to that era.

14
00:02:39,482 --> 00:02:41,602
It has seen the British rule..

15
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:44,242
..as well as Bapu's seat
of 'Ahimsa' (non-violence).

16
00:02:44,362 --> 00:02:45,722
Am late!

17
00:02:46,242 --> 00:02:49,362
Damn you! You are supposed
to deliver the news paper at 5!

18
00:02:49,482 --> 00:02:51,682
And now it is 6. You won't get paid today!

19
00:02:52,882 --> 00:02:54,482
Times have changed, sir.

20
00:02:54,722 --> 00:02:56,682
So violent words are allowed now.

21
00:02:57,282 --> 00:02:59,442
Sister, can I get soap for bathing?

22
00:02:59,522 --> 00:03:01,442
But nothing has changed
in the India Lodge.

23
00:03:01,962 --> 00:03:05,362
Everyone lives together without
any discrimination of caste and creed.

24
00:03:05,442 --> 00:03:06,322
Why so angry?!

25
00:03:06,402 --> 00:03:08,362
Everyone pays the rent
as per their convenience.

26
00:03:09,082 --> 00:03:10,282
Or not..

27
00:03:11,202 --> 00:03:13,322
Check when the tea will be delivered.

28
00:03:16,202 --> 00:03:17,562
This is Sarita mother.

29
00:03:17,762 --> 00:03:20,802
Oh my dear!
Actually she is the owner of India Lodge.

30
00:03:21,162 --> 00:03:24,042
But she is more of a mother than an owner.

31
00:03:24,242 --> 00:03:26,882
She has allowed the entry of
three unique characters over here..

32
00:03:27,322 --> 00:03:29,962
..who have got to do
nothing with non violence.

33
00:03:30,082 --> 00:03:32,362
It is a five minute clip. Don't worry.

34
00:03:32,442 --> 00:03:34,282
The girl is not even aware.

35
00:03:35,522 --> 00:03:38,722
It is in Gujrati dear.
So the rate is 5000. Now tell me.

36
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:33,122
This one is also Gujrati. Hundred percent.

37
00:04:34,922 --> 00:04:36,842
Yogesh! Stop it, lad!

38
00:04:36,922 --> 00:04:39,602
In last three months, I have
had to call the carpenter eight times!

39
00:04:39,682 --> 00:04:40,962
Improve your nature.

40
00:04:42,882 --> 00:04:46,682
Nature and principles
can never be changed.

41
00:04:47,042 --> 00:04:49,922
Brother Yogesh..
he can't control his anger.

42
00:04:49,962 --> 00:04:51,762
And hence he can't keep any job.

43
00:04:53,962 --> 00:04:57,722
Wow boss! Solid boss!

44
00:04:57,802 --> 00:05:01,882
Seeing her for the first time!

45
00:05:05,322 --> 00:05:07,082
What amazing girl!

46
00:05:12,722 --> 00:05:15,722
Hey! You didn't tell me that next Ms.
India belongs to Ahmedabad!

47
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:19,282
Look at the walk.. what a cat walk!

48
00:07:08,282 --> 00:07:11,322
Come on.. show me a dog walk!

49
00:07:13,082 --> 00:07:13,842
Come on!

50
00:07:14,362 --> 00:07:15,602
This is sister Janvi.

51
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:21,322
Oh my God! If girls can be so hot headed,
the Government should..

52
00:07:21,402 --> 00:07:23,882
..start 'Save from girl child'
program rather than 'Save the girl child'!

53
00:07:26,082 --> 00:07:27,322
How can you beat them so much?

54
00:07:27,402 --> 00:07:28,442
If something happens to them..

55
00:07:32,722 --> 00:07:35,482
Where were you when
they were misbehaving?!

56
00:07:36,962 --> 00:07:37,922
Get lost!

57
00:07:56,082 --> 00:07:58,362
Tell me, who do we have to take?

58
00:07:58,962 --> 00:08:02,482
If you are fixing a meeting with Alia,
then take me.

59
00:08:04,282 --> 00:08:06,882
You've come to the wrong address.
Get lost!

60
00:08:07,882 --> 00:08:10,962
This is the address
from where the call came.

61
00:08:11,122 --> 00:08:12,482
Someone has had a fracture.

62
00:08:12,562 --> 00:08:14,042
Shall I tell you the patients' name?

63
00:08:14,722 --> 00:08:15,962
Prakash and Hari.

64
00:08:16,322 --> 00:08:19,362
Hey! I am Prakash.

65
00:08:19,642 --> 00:08:22,962
If you are kidding,
it won't be good for you!

66
00:08:23,562 --> 00:08:25,602
Get lost. Go!

67
00:08:26,162 --> 00:08:29,082
Scoot!
- Scoot!

68
00:08:52,882 --> 00:08:54,762
Hey! Who are you?!

69
00:09:03,842 --> 00:09:05,682
Hey friend! You're too much.

70
00:09:06,082 --> 00:09:07,762
I asked you to come at 10:30 a.m..

71
00:09:07,842 --> 00:09:09,322
..but you came at 10:15 a.m. itself.

72
00:09:09,402 --> 00:09:10,682
That is not right.

73
00:09:10,802 --> 00:09:14,602
Do you know I had to come
so long from the wrong side!

74
00:09:14,802 --> 00:09:17,282
These people will be done for today.

75
00:09:17,442 --> 00:09:19,802
It is their last day here.

76
00:09:20,242 --> 00:09:22,602
You do something..
open the ambulance doors.

77
00:09:22,802 --> 00:09:24,082
And count till 108.

78
00:09:24,682 --> 00:09:29,762
In 108 seconds, all of them
will be in 108 (dial an ambulance)!

79
00:09:30,162 --> 00:09:31,802
Ok.. Go on.
- Open the doors.

80
00:09:31,882 --> 00:09:33,602
Go!

81
00:10:17,562 --> 00:10:20,242
Brother Ram whom you
beat up so many times..

82
00:10:20,682 --> 00:10:22,602
..I have tea at his place daily!

83
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:25,402
So I have to look after him!

84
00:10:28,042 --> 00:10:30,042
Come on! Come on!

85
00:10:56,722 --> 00:10:59,362
Who are you? What is your name?

86
00:10:59,842 --> 00:11:02,202
Tell me your name.

87
00:11:06,882 --> 00:11:09,482
My name.. Jay.

88
00:11:09,642 --> 00:11:14,162
Brother Jay! He is stylish..
and he is a bluff master too!

89
00:11:14,522 --> 00:11:15,962
And all those who cross his way..

90
00:11:16,082 --> 00:11:18,762
Glory to Mother India!

91
00:11:18,842 --> 00:11:20,042
..go their way too!

92
00:11:20,202 --> 00:11:21,722
What say?!

93
00:11:29,082 --> 00:11:30,322
Why are you sitting here?

94
00:11:30,882 --> 00:11:33,442
The room is locked.
- Oh!

95
00:11:33,522 --> 00:11:38,082
Bhikhu has said that until
we pay the rent we will have no entry.

96
00:11:39,082 --> 00:11:42,442
I see. The room doors are locked, right?

97
00:11:43,162 --> 00:11:45,042
The room doors are locked, right?

98
00:11:45,122 --> 00:11:46,042
Come on.. I'll take you some other way.

99
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:48,642
Come on.. get up! Come on! Come on!

100
00:11:49,562 --> 00:11:51,562
Let's go.. Einstein has got an idea!

101
00:11:55,282 --> 00:11:57,202
The place.. the place..

102
00:12:00,842 --> 00:12:04,162
Hey! Which way?

103
00:12:06,042 --> 00:12:07,082
What?

104
00:12:08,202 --> 00:12:09,242
Seriously?

105
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:12,562
It's not Mount Everest. Climb it quickly!

106
00:12:12,722 --> 00:12:14,042
He..

107
00:12:15,802 --> 00:12:20,042
Come on.. we have been called..

108
00:12:31,602 --> 00:12:33,442
Is he Spiderman's nephew?

109
00:12:35,122 --> 00:12:36,602
The light is on! It's on!

110
00:12:36,682 --> 00:12:37,922
Get me some water please..

111
00:12:38,482 --> 00:12:40,482
Go and tell your wifey!
- Thank you.

112
00:12:40,762 --> 00:12:43,722
Hey genius.. how will she go to her room?

113
00:12:43,842 --> 00:12:46,802
The balance of my idea is over.

114
00:12:46,882 --> 00:12:49,602
You can set your own place
according to your size and sleep.

115
00:12:49,682 --> 00:12:51,282
You'll need bigger place, isn't it?

116
00:12:57,802 --> 00:13:00,722
Hey pal! He is going
to be this way only, Yogi!

117
00:13:00,882 --> 00:13:03,722
But we will have to
manage some money soon.

118
00:13:04,482 --> 00:13:05,842
From where?

119
00:13:06,642 --> 00:13:08,882
I was laid off today at work.

120
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:11,962
And your law practice has just started.

121
00:13:13,242 --> 00:13:14,522
And this fellow..

122
00:13:16,042 --> 00:13:19,482
He wants to be a hero,
but is working as an AD for free.

123
00:13:20,322 --> 00:13:23,042
AD means Assistant Director.
It's a big post.

124
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:25,482
Hey! Go to sleep!
- Good night!

125
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:27,522
How will we manage!

126
00:13:28,202 --> 00:13:30,202
Oh God!

127
00:13:30,882 --> 00:13:34,682
I pray that at least one of the
three of us get a break soon. Please!

128
00:13:37,082 --> 00:13:39,322
Oh damn you! What is this!

129
00:13:39,962 --> 00:13:45,082
So now, because of you,
I have lock the doors here and there?!

130
00:13:45,162 --> 00:13:46,442
Why?!

131
00:13:46,522 --> 00:13:47,722
Bhikhu..

132
00:13:48,842 --> 00:13:53,082
Your locks and these pigeon nests..
do they allow us to sleep peacefully?

133
00:13:53,282 --> 00:13:54,322
Nests?!

134
00:13:54,402 --> 00:13:57,642
And look Bhikhu..
we haven't has tea also today.

135
00:13:57,882 --> 00:14:00,362
If you're here to ask for rent then,
please go back.

136
00:14:00,482 --> 00:14:02,162
Or else you'll get one tight slap from me.

137
00:14:02,242 --> 00:14:03,042
What nonsense!

138
00:14:03,122 --> 00:14:04,602
I came to ask for rent and
have to bear the beatings too!

139
00:14:04,682 --> 00:14:06,402
Hey Bhikhu..
- What?

140
00:14:06,962 --> 00:14:09,562
Didn't I give you those extra bucks,
didn't I?

141
00:14:09,642 --> 00:14:11,562
Yes.. yes..
- Then count it.

142
00:14:11,762 --> 00:14:14,202
What extra bucks?
You gave me no extra bucks.

143
00:14:14,282 --> 00:14:17,882
The extra bucks that you gave
me were those pending from last month.

144
00:14:17,962 --> 00:14:22,322
And counting this month,
now its four months.. yes four months!

145
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:24,442
So don't treat me like this.

146
00:14:24,522 --> 00:14:27,882
Go and meet Sarita mother..
come on get up everyone.

147
00:14:28,282 --> 00:14:29,242
Do you have rice flakes
for breakfast today?

148
00:14:29,322 --> 00:14:30,162
No.

149
00:14:30,242 --> 00:14:31,402
Then 'Idli'( steamed snack)?

150
00:14:31,482 --> 00:14:32,642
Not at all.

151
00:14:33,202 --> 00:14:35,722
Come on.. sister Janvi, you come.
they will take long!

152
00:14:35,802 --> 00:14:37,602
I got so late today.

153
00:14:37,882 --> 00:14:41,802
Mother.. mother..

154
00:14:42,042 --> 00:14:43,882
The three of them again
jumped the wall and came.

155
00:14:44,082 --> 00:14:46,402
Yes mother. This is the limit now.

156
00:14:46,602 --> 00:14:47,762
You have to say something to them now.

157
00:14:47,882 --> 00:14:50,402
It's been six months, mother.
There is a limit of free lodging!

158
00:14:50,842 --> 00:14:52,322
They will pay, Bhikhu.

159
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:54,082
Ours is the India Lodge.

160
00:14:54,482 --> 00:14:56,842
What is our P and L?

161
00:14:57,402 --> 00:14:58,322
'Prem' (love) and 'Laagni' (caring).

162
00:14:58,402 --> 00:14:59,402
Yes, I know.

163
00:14:59,762 --> 00:15:03,082
This India Lodge is standing
on the cement of relationships.

164
00:15:03,162 --> 00:15:04,642
That is why they are not paying the rent.

165
00:15:04,962 --> 00:15:06,322
They are being pampered.

166
00:15:07,762 --> 00:15:09,922
Aniket..
- Aniket..

167
00:15:11,362 --> 00:15:12,802
Yes Aniket..
- Hi mom.

168
00:15:12,882 --> 00:15:14,682
I was going to call you, son.

169
00:15:15,322 --> 00:15:16,882
You've been so busy.

170
00:15:17,562 --> 00:15:21,242
Yes mom. That is why I
couldn't call you since a month.

171
00:15:21,442 --> 00:15:23,922
No problem. Work is important.

172
00:15:24,682 --> 00:15:25,802
Is it very cold there?

173
00:15:26,082 --> 00:15:28,282
I heard in news that
it's going to snow there.

174
00:15:29,242 --> 00:15:31,242
The media is always creating hype!

175
00:15:31,522 --> 00:15:32,962
It's normal for us.

176
00:15:33,482 --> 00:15:37,722
But listen.. I have won gold
medal in state level sword competition.

177
00:15:38,362 --> 00:15:39,322
Oh wow!

178
00:15:40,242 --> 00:15:42,162
I am proud of you, son.
- Thank you, mom.

179
00:15:42,482 --> 00:15:44,242
But I don't like this at all.

180
00:15:45,042 --> 00:15:48,922
Our heritage is of religion not warfare.

181
00:15:50,162 --> 00:15:53,242
Mom please..
what times are you living in?!

182
00:15:53,362 --> 00:15:54,722
World has changed.

183
00:15:55,042 --> 00:15:56,562
Anyway.. I am coming to India.

184
00:15:57,082 --> 00:15:58,522
Really! When?

185
00:15:58,602 --> 00:15:59,562
Next week.

186
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:02,322
And we will talk a lot after I come.

187
00:16:03,042 --> 00:16:05,202
Ok mom.. I'll hang up now.
It's night here.

188
00:16:05,282 --> 00:16:06,962
Ok son. Go to sleep.

189
00:16:07,802 --> 00:16:10,322
I will be waiting for you.
- Ok mom. Good night.

190
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:11,762
Good night son. Goodnight!

191
00:16:13,082 --> 00:16:14,922
Brother Aniket is coming?
- Yes.

192
00:16:15,122 --> 00:16:17,442
Mother.. I would suggest
that even you go to America..

193
00:16:17,762 --> 00:16:19,122
..along with brother Aniket.

194
00:16:19,482 --> 00:16:21,602
Really! There is nothing worthwhile here.

195
00:16:21,682 --> 00:16:22,882
What do you have here?

196
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:25,242
Our heritage is here, Bhikhu.

197
00:16:25,842 --> 00:16:27,562
We can't sell it.

198
00:16:27,802 --> 00:16:30,922
We must forward it to the
next generation with knowledge.

199
00:16:32,802 --> 00:16:35,962
Even I have started speaking
like outsiders, isn't it mother?

200
00:16:38,642 --> 00:16:39,522
Sorry.

201
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:45,362
Now stop chatting Bhikhu
and start cleaning up Aniket's room.

202
00:16:45,482 --> 00:16:46,482
Yes.

203
00:16:46,562 --> 00:16:50,242
Get the furniture in Aniket's
room polished now. Come on!

204
00:16:50,322 --> 00:16:52,482
Start the work quickly.
My Aniket is coming!

205
00:16:52,562 --> 00:16:54,842
What are you saying?!
Brother Aniket is coming!

206
00:16:54,962 --> 00:16:56,802
Did you hear? All of you?

207
00:16:56,882 --> 00:16:58,242
Captain America is arriving.

208
00:16:59,722 --> 00:17:03,882
Sister Sarita ..
why do you tell Bhikhu? We're here.

209
00:17:04,282 --> 00:17:05,482
Tell us.. what needs to be done?

210
00:17:05,562 --> 00:17:07,922
Aunt.. one of my friend's
is an interior designer.

211
00:17:08,082 --> 00:17:10,642
She will get your renovation
done within your budget.

212
00:17:10,722 --> 00:17:11,802
What do you say?
- Perfect!

213
00:17:11,882 --> 00:17:13,922
Yes pal!
- Of course!

214
00:17:14,282 --> 00:17:16,042
The building will stay as it is.

215
00:17:16,122 --> 00:17:19,282
Just as India Lodge is your home,
it is his too.

216
00:17:19,362 --> 00:17:24,162
But aunty.. Aniket is coming
to India after such a long time.

217
00:17:26,362 --> 00:17:28,202
How will he feel after seeing all this?

218
00:17:28,282 --> 00:17:29,762
I thought you came
to speak about the rent.

219
00:17:29,842 --> 00:17:32,842
Huh! Rent?!

220
00:17:33,362 --> 00:17:34,322
Shut up!

221
00:17:34,922 --> 00:17:38,322
Actually what happened is..
the three of us collected lots of money.

222
00:17:38,402 --> 00:17:41,482
We thought we would
surely pay the rent today.

223
00:17:42,282 --> 00:17:43,962
And all of a sudden,
there was a call from her house.

224
00:17:45,082 --> 00:17:48,122
Isn't it? There was a
call from your house, right.

225
00:17:48,202 --> 00:17:49,762
Her younger brother has been hit.

226
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:51,482
I have a brother too?

227
00:17:51,602 --> 00:17:52,722
Younger brother.

228
00:17:52,962 --> 00:17:54,282
He has been hit.

229
00:17:54,362 --> 00:17:57,242
We gave all the money to the doctor.

230
00:17:57,322 --> 00:17:59,202
Doctor said that he would
give treatment only if..

231
00:17:59,282 --> 00:18:00,322
..we paid Rs. One Lakh.

232
00:18:00,402 --> 00:18:01,482
Mother, he is lying.

233
00:18:01,562 --> 00:18:03,082
And there went our money.

234
00:18:04,562 --> 00:18:07,762
If you say.. if you say..

235
00:18:08,362 --> 00:18:09,562
..will take a loan and pay you.

236
00:18:09,722 --> 00:18:13,482
Yogi! We are going to be finished!
Cry a bit now!

237
00:18:13,562 --> 00:18:15,522
You're overacting now.

238
00:18:15,802 --> 00:18:16,882
Next month.

239
00:18:20,162 --> 00:18:21,122
Yes!

240
00:18:21,202 --> 00:18:23,962
Bhikhu, open the locks of their rooms.

241
00:18:24,082 --> 00:18:25,682
Bhikhu is dead!

242
00:18:27,322 --> 00:18:28,442
Mother..

243
00:18:28,602 --> 00:18:32,082
Bhikhu bro! I need a shower.

244
00:18:32,282 --> 00:18:33,482
Come on, open the door.

245
00:18:33,562 --> 00:18:34,682
Let's go.. come on!

246
00:18:34,762 --> 00:18:37,482
But I have other work..
- Come on!

247
00:18:38,402 --> 00:18:41,202
Sir.. sir,
did you get the details of this case?

248
00:18:41,642 --> 00:18:42,322
Yes.

249
00:18:42,922 --> 00:18:45,162
Sir, it is clearly a hit and run case.

250
00:18:45,322 --> 00:18:46,882
The boy was racing for fun.

251
00:18:47,122 --> 00:18:48,442
How can we defend him?!

252
00:18:48,522 --> 00:18:49,722
Just like a defendant.

253
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:50,882
Sir!

254
00:18:51,682 --> 00:18:53,962
Sir, it's not a joke. Seriously..

255
00:18:54,122 --> 00:18:56,802
Janvi.. that's our job.

256
00:18:57,442 --> 00:19:00,762
What did you think?
All lawyers fight for truth?

257
00:19:01,522 --> 00:19:05,202
Then all the murder cases and
rape cases would end in one hearing.

258
00:19:05,922 --> 00:19:10,642
Janvi.. it is our responsibility
to defend our client.

259
00:19:10,922 --> 00:19:14,282
Just because the father
of the boy is a big shot..

260
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:15,722
..and has many contacts?!

261
00:19:16,042 --> 00:19:18,682
Then who will think about
the person who has died?

262
00:19:18,762 --> 00:19:21,202
They will think.. it is the media's job.

263
00:19:21,562 --> 00:19:23,082
The story will be printed for three days.

264
00:19:23,122 --> 00:19:24,802
And then settlement there too.

265
00:19:24,962 --> 00:19:27,122
After that, out of court settlement.

266
00:19:27,602 --> 00:19:30,282
Such cases happen in
this country every day.

267
00:19:30,562 --> 00:19:33,962
So please..
don't get emotional about such things.

268
00:19:34,122 --> 00:19:36,282
Sir please.. this is really not done.

269
00:19:37,882 --> 00:19:39,242
Leave this case.

270
00:19:39,562 --> 00:19:42,602
Brother Tejas,
you only handle this case now.

271
00:19:43,042 --> 00:19:43,882
Okay, sir.

272
00:19:43,962 --> 00:19:46,522
And you please focus on civil matters.

273
00:19:48,362 --> 00:19:51,722
Sir, if we too support the wrongdoers..

274
00:19:51,802 --> 00:19:53,602
..what is the difference
between us and the criminals?

275
00:19:53,722 --> 00:19:55,322
We don't give judgments.

276
00:19:55,442 --> 00:19:57,682
It is the job of the court.
Let them do it.

277
00:19:57,962 --> 00:20:00,762
The hearing that we have next week,,
you start preparing for that, ok.

278
00:20:00,842 --> 00:20:02,562
Very good. Go now.

279
00:20:06,362 --> 00:20:07,882
Ok Tejas.. what were you saying?

280
00:20:07,962 --> 00:20:10,842
Sir.. this particular case..

281
00:20:10,962 --> 00:20:14,202
Mark the workers' in time
and out time in this register.

282
00:20:14,562 --> 00:20:18,122
And when the day ends, get
everyone checked by the security.

283
00:20:18,362 --> 00:20:19,322
Ok.

284
00:20:21,282 --> 00:20:24,202
It may be your first day.
But start work right away.

285
00:20:24,642 --> 00:20:26,522
Ok. All the best.
- Thank you, sir.

286
00:20:40,282 --> 00:20:41,602
Hey..

287
00:20:42,762 --> 00:20:44,322
Come here.

288
00:20:45,922 --> 00:20:47,642
Tell me.
- Name?

289
00:20:47,842 --> 00:20:49,082
Kanhaiyya.

290
00:20:49,682 --> 00:20:51,642
What are you doing here?
- Work.

291
00:20:52,762 --> 00:20:53,922
Don't you go to school?

292
00:20:54,042 --> 00:20:56,522
If I go for studying,
where will the money come from?

293
00:20:57,962 --> 00:21:00,602
Hey Kanhaiyya..
get two half cups tea. Be quick.

294
00:21:00,682 --> 00:21:02,162
Yes.. coming.

295
00:21:02,362 --> 00:21:05,562
How many times should I tell you!

296
00:21:05,642 --> 00:21:07,282
I am going to cut your
salary for shirking of work.

297
00:21:07,362 --> 00:21:08,842
I don't want to hear anything.

298
00:21:08,882 --> 00:21:11,322
Forgive me sir.
- Get tea fast.. come on.

299
00:21:11,522 --> 00:21:14,482
Hello.. yes brother..

300
00:21:15,082 --> 00:21:17,522
Yes. I am Jay Damekar.

301
00:21:17,802 --> 00:21:21,282
What I was saying is that the
audition that your daughter gave..

302
00:21:21,362 --> 00:21:24,522
..what actually has happened is
that she forgot her dialogues, ok.

303
00:21:24,602 --> 00:21:27,442
So now.. to make her
remember the dialogues..

304
00:21:27,522 --> 00:21:30,762
..it will cost Rs. 7514 only.

305
00:21:31,362 --> 00:21:33,962
I said Rs. 14 not seven and half!

306
00:21:34,362 --> 00:21:37,242
No, I can't say that!
I am not that kind of person!

307
00:21:37,322 --> 00:21:40,482
Hello.. hello.. I said Rs. 700!

308
00:21:41,162 --> 00:21:43,722
Hello.. hello, what is it?

309
00:21:44,282 --> 00:21:46,802
Brother, this is Jay..
Jay, the designer.

310
00:21:47,082 --> 00:21:48,602
The audition that your son gave..

311
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:51,122
..his eyes are getting shut in it.

312
00:21:51,362 --> 00:21:54,162
And when the eyes get shut,
it costs to open them up.

313
00:21:54,242 --> 00:21:55,482
Rs. One lakh totally.

314
00:21:56,082 --> 00:21:58,362
I said 10000.. I never said 1 lakh.

315
00:21:58,442 --> 00:21:59,842
Shall we round it off at Rs. 100?

316
00:21:59,962 --> 00:22:01,322
Tell me fast.

317
00:22:01,482 --> 00:22:05,122
Last price.. 10.
At least I can recover tea cost.

318
00:22:06,802 --> 00:22:09,962
No one appreciates my talent,
friend.

319
00:22:10,082 --> 00:22:12,362
Everything is a mess.

320
00:22:12,442 --> 00:22:15,882
What shall we do now..

321
00:22:15,962 --> 00:22:17,642
Oh yes.. just a minute.. Hello..

322
00:22:17,922 --> 00:22:20,322
I am graced with God's mercy.

323
00:22:20,682 --> 00:22:22,962
Have lots of money.. lots of it!

324
00:22:23,082 --> 00:22:28,082
Now, I can make your son a star..
tell me, should I?

325
00:22:28,802 --> 00:22:33,682
Only and only..
- Hey bro! it will cost Rs. 5 lakhs.

326
00:22:33,762 --> 00:22:36,282
How much? 5 lakhs! Do you have?

327
00:22:36,562 --> 00:22:38,722
Then why are you messing with
my brains so early in the morning!

328
00:22:38,802 --> 00:22:39,962
Hang up!

329
00:22:40,482 --> 00:22:43,442
What nonsense is this..
- What are you doing Jackie pal!

330
00:22:43,722 --> 00:22:44,962
With great difficulty,
I had found a scapegoat!

331
00:22:45,042 --> 00:22:46,722
You're just crazy!
- You moron!

332
00:22:46,842 --> 00:22:48,962
Stop fooling around
with people now.

333
00:22:49,162 --> 00:22:51,202
Stop ruining other people's dreams.

334
00:22:51,402 --> 00:22:53,762
You don't know how it feels
to have your dreams crushed.

335
00:22:53,842 --> 00:22:54,882
Look here.

336
00:22:56,322 --> 00:22:57,162
What happened, dear?

337
00:22:57,962 --> 00:23:00,282
What was your dream?
Tell me what was it?

338
00:23:00,362 --> 00:23:01,762
I wanted to learn Kung-fu.

339
00:23:02,362 --> 00:23:05,282
You can't do it at this age, dear..
Chinese Kung-fu and all!

340
00:23:05,362 --> 00:23:06,162
Just look at you..

341
00:23:06,242 --> 00:23:09,482
When you were born,
you were thirteen years old then!

342
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:13,242
Hey moron! I have come to this
stage by cooking Chinese for you all!

343
00:23:13,602 --> 00:23:15,402
Stop all this and take up a job!

344
00:23:15,482 --> 00:23:16,762
I can't take up a 10-6 job and all!

345
00:23:16,842 --> 00:23:18,962
I will mess up with 10
people over there! No way!

346
00:23:19,322 --> 00:23:20,402
I am my own boss.

347
00:23:20,522 --> 00:23:23,802
What boss?! You owe the tea
fellow for last three months tea!

348
00:23:23,882 --> 00:23:25,402
You haven't paid him a buck!

349
00:23:25,562 --> 00:23:28,842
And..
- Ramu uncle, is it? Ramu uncle..

350
00:23:29,162 --> 00:23:30,402
He is my kin!

351
00:23:30,482 --> 00:23:32,162
He won't ask for money
from me for one and a half years.

352
00:23:32,242 --> 00:23:32,882
You can go and ask! Go on.

353
00:23:32,962 --> 00:23:34,762
What nonsense!
Just because I am your friend..

354
00:23:34,842 --> 00:23:37,282
..and I have paid for all the dues,
you are sitting here. Got it!

355
00:23:37,362 --> 00:23:39,482
Do you ask for money? Do you?

356
00:23:39,562 --> 00:23:40,962
You don't.

357
00:23:41,122 --> 00:23:42,522
Ramu uncle..
he is not asking for money, ok.

358
00:23:42,602 --> 00:23:43,962
That is why you have
become so irresponsible.

359
00:23:45,562 --> 00:23:47,242
Talking nonsense
early in the morning!

360
00:23:47,322 --> 00:23:49,322
Lots of money..
I need to do something!

361
00:23:49,402 --> 00:23:51,762
Brother..
have some work. Will have to go.

362
00:23:51,842 --> 00:23:52,682
See you in evening.

363
00:23:52,802 --> 00:23:54,802
No work you have, just bluffing..

364
00:23:54,922 --> 00:23:56,602
Mend your ways now!
- Scoot!

365
00:23:57,482 --> 00:23:59,762
"This is your house and mine.."

366
00:24:00,402 --> 00:24:02,562
I'll kill that pigeon!

367
00:24:02,642 --> 00:24:03,842
Drive it off, Yogesh!

368
00:24:03,922 --> 00:24:06,202
It keeps coming
and building a nest!

369
00:24:06,402 --> 00:24:08,602
Hey! Talk softly.

370
00:24:08,842 --> 00:24:10,842
If sister Sarita hears,
she will deliver a lecture.

371
00:24:11,122 --> 00:24:14,122
Dear.. this is India Lodge.

372
00:24:14,642 --> 00:24:17,922
Just as this is your house,
it's their house too.

373
00:24:18,122 --> 00:24:20,082
Remember what Bapu said.

374
00:24:20,562 --> 00:24:23,242
Remember.. remember what Bapu said!

375
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:26,162
If the pigeon shits
on one shoulder..

376
00:24:26,282 --> 00:24:29,242
..you must offer
another shoulder too.

377
00:24:30,682 --> 00:24:34,522
Yes.. but that too
involves her principles.

378
00:24:34,602 --> 00:24:36,282
Hey! What I said just now..
these are her principles?!

379
00:24:36,562 --> 00:24:39,362
Sister's watch batteries
have expired in 1942!

380
00:24:39,802 --> 00:24:43,202
In the age of smart phones,
the woman uses Gramophone!

381
00:24:44,322 --> 00:24:47,682
Why doesn't man change
his name and surname with time?

382
00:24:47,762 --> 00:24:48,962
Why are you bothered!?

383
00:24:51,722 --> 00:24:54,322
I mean.. you see..

384
00:24:54,442 --> 00:24:56,642
First answer my question Jay.

385
00:24:59,482 --> 00:25:02,922
Yes. I mean we can't
change our name and surname.

386
00:25:03,442 --> 00:25:04,962
Actually, it's our identity.

387
00:25:05,082 --> 00:25:09,642
Yes!! Similarly, values
and heritage are our identity.

388
00:25:09,802 --> 00:25:11,042
They cannot be changed.

389
00:25:12,122 --> 00:25:14,482
And as far as making
fun of Bapu is concerned..

390
00:25:14,682 --> 00:25:17,202
..it might be a fashion
amongst you youngsters.

391
00:25:17,602 --> 00:25:18,842
But doesn't matter.

392
00:25:19,202 --> 00:25:21,482
As you grow older, you'll become
more understanding and perhaps..

393
00:25:21,562 --> 00:25:23,802
..then you might understand
Bapu's values too.

394
00:25:28,602 --> 00:25:29,962
Good bye.

395
00:25:30,882 --> 00:25:31,922
Damn!

396
00:25:33,282 --> 00:25:34,282
Couldn't you tell me!

397
00:25:35,762 --> 00:25:37,042
Glory to Bapu Rani!

398
00:26:01,642 --> 00:26:05,122
This looks even better in real.
It's just perfect.

399
00:26:05,682 --> 00:26:07,642
See Mr. Henry, I told you.

400
00:26:08,082 --> 00:26:09,762
This is the right
property for business.

401
00:26:10,882 --> 00:26:12,562
So.. lets close the deal today.

402
00:26:13,082 --> 00:26:15,242
I don't want to waste my time.
- Sure.

403
00:26:16,522 --> 00:26:19,122
Please don't talk
to me about rent and all.

404
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:21,442
This used to be the meeting
place for freedom fighters.

405
00:26:21,962 --> 00:26:23,842
Even Gandhiji visited
here many times.

406
00:26:23,922 --> 00:26:25,802
Sister Sarita wrote
here in English.

407
00:26:27,122 --> 00:26:28,602
Hey!
- Sorry.

408
00:26:28,802 --> 00:26:29,802
Look here brother..

409
00:26:30,082 --> 00:26:33,202
Nice meeting you..
nice meeting you!

410
00:26:33,962 --> 00:26:35,962
Good, good..
have a nice day! Have a nice day!

411
00:26:38,882 --> 00:26:40,402
See what we got?!

412
00:26:41,882 --> 00:26:42,962
2 dollars.

413
00:26:43,322 --> 00:26:44,922
We don't even have
money to convert it.

414
00:26:45,402 --> 00:26:46,642
Hey!

415
00:26:46,802 --> 00:26:48,362
Hey Bhikhu bro!

416
00:26:48,602 --> 00:26:50,162
What is it?
- What is it?!

417
00:26:50,242 --> 00:26:51,162
Rent.

418
00:26:51,922 --> 00:26:52,762
These are fake notes.

419
00:26:52,842 --> 00:26:54,362
Not fake.. they are dollars.

420
00:26:54,722 --> 00:26:55,762
Dollars?!

421
00:26:55,842 --> 00:26:57,802
They are extra. Consider
it paid for all three of us.

422
00:26:58,082 --> 00:26:58,962
But..
- Hey!

423
00:26:59,082 --> 00:27:00,402
You now have the rent till
the next year. So don't ask again.

424
00:27:00,682 --> 00:27:01,722
But how will I get it converted?

425
00:27:02,322 --> 00:27:03,682
Then shall I take it back?
- No, no! No, no!

426
00:27:03,762 --> 00:27:06,202
I'll get it converted.
- Get going!

427
00:27:06,762 --> 00:27:09,242
Sister Sarita, he is Mr. Henry.

428
00:27:09,562 --> 00:27:11,562
He has come here from
America to do business.

429
00:27:12,122 --> 00:27:15,722
Sir, this is Sarita madam,
owner of India Lodge.

430
00:27:16,322 --> 00:27:18,682
Mrs. Sarita,
it's a pleasure to meet you.

431
00:27:19,122 --> 00:27:21,082
Nice to meet you too, Mr. Henry.

432
00:27:21,522 --> 00:27:24,802
Look miss..
I don't believe in small talk.

433
00:27:25,082 --> 00:27:27,122
So let's talk business.

434
00:27:27,722 --> 00:27:30,482
My company has loved your property.

435
00:27:30,962 --> 00:27:33,322
And we're ready to
pay fair price for it.

436
00:27:34,282 --> 00:27:38,282
Brother Bhavesh.. why do
you keep spoiling their time?

437
00:27:39,402 --> 00:27:41,642
Mr. Henry, I am sorry.

438
00:27:42,562 --> 00:27:45,442
India Lodge is not for
sale and it will never be.

439
00:27:45,682 --> 00:27:47,762
Sister Sarita,
don't take such hasty decisions.

440
00:27:48,322 --> 00:27:49,642
At least hear his offer.

441
00:27:49,882 --> 00:27:52,722
No offer can change my decision.

442
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:56,842
If you feel the valuation is less,
then tell me. We can do that too.

443
00:27:57,362 --> 00:27:58,962
I repeat myself, brother Bhavesh.

444
00:27:59,642 --> 00:28:01,922
Values don't have valuation.

445
00:28:02,842 --> 00:28:06,202
So.. don't worry Ms. Sarita.

446
00:28:07,082 --> 00:28:09,082
I'll give you time to consider.

447
00:28:09,842 --> 00:28:13,162
And I promise you,
I'll match any offer.

448
00:28:17,642 --> 00:28:19,922
Greetings.
- Greetings.

449
00:28:20,682 --> 00:28:22,122
Let's go.
- Yeah.

450
00:28:29,922 --> 00:28:31,042
Who is that?

451
00:28:32,202 --> 00:28:34,682
He is my son, Aniket.

452
00:28:36,282 --> 00:28:40,722
Wow! You've got a lovely family.
- Thank you.

453
00:28:43,962 --> 00:28:45,842
Greetings.
- Greetings.

454
00:28:50,962 --> 00:28:53,082
Mr. Henry,
I can show you other properties.

455
00:28:53,162 --> 00:28:55,242
If you want..
- No Bhavesh.

456
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,440
India Lodge!

457
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:06,040
India Lodge is what
I want and I will get it.

458
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:07,840
Come on.

459
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,920
Hakka Noodles..

460
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,480
Hey Kamlesh..
these days you're acting too smart.

461
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,920
Who are you?

462
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,720
Why are you doing?

463
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,680
"Can't spend these
days and nights.."

464
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,760
"I need to tell you
what's in my heart."

465
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:55,840
"Let me tell you today.."

466
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,640
Why did you cut my cable wires?

467
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:05,880
V P.. VP..
- VP.. VP.. a rise in BP.

468
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,200
Why did you cut the cable wires?

469
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:21,320
You know that the cable
is VP's reputation, don't you?

470
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:29,120
A cable was cut. It is
as good as chopping VP's nose.

471
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,720
What?!

472
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:35,120
Mummy, mummy.. who is that?

473
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:39,160
Hey! He is so cute!

474
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,720
Look son.. I'll tell you a story.

475
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:50,480
A lion lived in a jungle.

476
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,600
All the animals feared him.

477
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,120
He was very hot tempered.

478
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:01,760
One day, a sly fox decided
to eat the lion's kill.

479
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,400
He thought no one will know.

480
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,440
But the lion is the
king of the jungle.

481
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,280
So he came to know.

482
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,240
Now you tell me..

483
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:20,520
..doesn't the sly fox deserve
punishment for his deeds?

484
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,320
Hey Munna..
- Tell me bro.

485
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,080
Open Facebook and post it.

486
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,160
Ok.

487
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:36,920
Vishwa Pratap (VP) feeling
nose cut with dear friend Kamlesh.

488
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:45,040
VP.. pal VP.. try to understand.

489
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,840
First mistake is always forgiven.

490
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:53,440
I'll shut my cable business
and go away. Is that fine?

491
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,880
Let's forget what happened.

492
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:02,920
If I forget that, people
will forget what the consequences..

493
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:05,760
..of going against VP are.

494
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,040
Hey bro Jackie Chan..
- Yes.

495
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,920
Send the bill for all
the Chinese food to me.

496
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,320
Hmm..

497
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,440
Take this.

498
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,800
Come on Kamlesh..

499
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:49,240
Hey Jackie-da.. Jackie-da..

500
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,520
Bro..
- What's up dear?!

501
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,520
All fine. You tell me.

502
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,560
I'll say something. Doesn't matter
if anyone else's food stall works..

503
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,560
..but my Jackie-da's Chinese
food will surely be a hit!

504
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,880
That is true!

505
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,640
Rice flakes! Rice flakes!

506
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,600
Damn it! What harassment!

507
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,880
What is this?!
Rice flakes everyday!

508
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,120
Don't want to eat.. Take them back!

509
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,440
I hate rice flakes
and I hate this place!

510
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,520
Were you thrown out too?

511
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:15,360
If it's for free, eat swearing too,
forget rice flakes.

512
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,800
Then shall I?

513
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,480
Come on.. don't be serious.

514
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,880
You're too much.

515
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:24,600
Bhikhu, take these 'Parothas'
(stuffed Indian bread)..

516
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,480
..to Janvi who is sitting there.

517
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,680
She doesn't like rice flakes.

518
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:32,000
They are not even paying the
rent and you do so much for them!

519
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,160
Bhikhu..

520
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,400
These people have come
here to make their careers.

521
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,560
They work very hard..

522
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,120
..and not just waste time.

523
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,720
Go, go.. give it to her.

524
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,920
Ok. I am not concerned anymore!

525
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,120
How is the work going on?
- Fine.

526
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,720
Be careful and don't
forget to wear the gloves.

527
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,240
Okay!

528
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:04,840
Kanhaiyya..
stay away from this machine.

529
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:08,080
But I need to do the
job I have been given.

530
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:11,320
You will only do the work
that I give you and no one else.

531
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,560
But if I refuse, they beat me.

532
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,040
Who beats you?

533
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,320
I am here, ok.

534
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:25,400
You know.. when I was a kid,
even I used to work in a factory like you.

535
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,480
But I also studied along with that.

536
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:29,560
That is why I am able
to do this job today.

537
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,760
Do you know how to read and write?
- No.

538
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,560
Do you want to be educated?
- Hmm.

539
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:43,000
Take these 50 bucks.
Get a notebook and a pencil.

540
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,680
And what about the money left?

541
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,280
You can have a
chocolate with it. Go!

542
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,480
I'll be back soon.

543
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,480
Stop.. stop!

544
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,200
Go on.. go on..

545
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,640
Where is he? Call Jackie.

546
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,400
Sir has gone out for some work.

547
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:08,800
This is his work.. what
other work has he gone out for?

548
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,200
Damn him!

549
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:13,240
Madam.. the service
is poor and so is the food..

550
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,600
You need to shut this place down.

551
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:17,280
Sir.. we make this type
of fried rice and noodles here.

552
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,640
No one has complained so far.

553
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,040
So I am lying. Is it?!

554
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,440
If you are not being able to
make Chinese, shut this place down.

555
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,600
Why are you looking around?
I am telling you.

556
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:32,360
Sorry sir.. I will change
it for you in just five minutes.

557
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,120
I won't pay for this.

558
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:37,200
And tell your cook to go to China,
eat there..

559
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,680
..and learn to cook
Chinese over there.

560
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,680
Yes sir. I'll exchange it for you.

561
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,800
Perfect.

562
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,400
Can't even tell the
name of the dish, isn't it?

563
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,200
Hakka noodles, sir.

564
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,680
No ma'am.
It is 'Kaccha' (raw) noodles.

565
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:54,760
Forget all that.
Couldn't find out your name.

566
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,480
Reema.

567
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:02,800
Reema! What a beautiful name!

568
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:08,400
R E E M A. What a unique name!

569
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:12,720
Reema.. you know..
I go to China every week.

570
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,440
Some day you can
come with me to China!

571
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,040
I have a farm house in Tokyo.

572
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:22,040
Hey! Tokyo is in Japan, not China.

573
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:24,040
Lower your hand. I did.

574
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,840
Don't try to act smart!
Else I'll send you to Allahabad.

575
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,480
Sir.. listen to me..

576
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:36,400
Reema.. Reema.. Reema.. Reema..

577
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,440
Give the food today for free.

578
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:44,880
Because Gandhiji said,
'Customer is the king'. Right?

579
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,320
Yes. Right.

580
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:50,560
Sir.. I'll exchange
the noodles for you.

581
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,800
Hmm.

582
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:59,040
Now without any messing
around with my head..

583
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,640
..get lost from here quietly. My
story is going to be cooked here.

584
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,200
Go now. Wash your face.

585
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,640
Hey Chotu.. Give cold
water at one number table.

586
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,720
Hey.. take the order
from number three table.

587
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:17,320
Hey! You? Here?!

588
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,040
Yes.

589
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,520
I work here.
Because college is now over.

590
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:26,520
Oh.. Good, good!
That's great! That's great!

591
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,280
All this happens
in foreign countries..

592
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,560
..you know.
- Yeah.

593
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:32,280
I have travelled
a lot you know.. a lot..

594
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,840
What work do you do?

595
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:39,800
I am a General Manager
in a multi-national company.

596
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:40,680
Oh!

597
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:42,920
Which company?

598
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,760
Which company!?

599
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,480
You asking me which company?
- Yes.

600
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,640
Royal Dragon.

601
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,160
Royal Dragon..

602
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,520
It is a Chinese company.

603
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:59,880
It's a Chinese Company..
very big. It's too big! Too big!

604
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:04,520
It may be too big.
But I have never heard the name.

605
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,760
Give me your phone.
Let's Google it.

606
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,720
Google? My net is off.

607
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,320
She wants to Google!

608
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:15,080
He is my kin..
the owner of this place is my kin!

609
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,880
If you have any kind of work,
just tell me.

610
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,520
Just tell me..
without any tension, ok.

611
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:22,480
The owner of this
place is your kin?

612
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,240
Close friend. Special friend!

613
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,520
So the owner of this
place is your close friend.

614
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,680
Hey Reema, you are back?

615
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,200
Great.

616
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,560
Hey Jay!

617
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:38,680
Did you meet him?
He is my friend. My close friend.

618
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,360
Close friend.
- Yes.

619
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,280
And did you meet her?

620
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:46,720
Hey! Reema.. she is my sister.

621
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:51,160
Reema! Friend's sister?!
- Yes.

622
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,160
Thank God!
- Why? What happened?

623
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,360
Nothing.
- Sure?

624
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,480
Yes.
- Ok.

625
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:58,200
I want to keep all this..
I will go. You carry on.

626
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,280
Take your time, ok!

627
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:06,760
Actually.. you know.. I am jobless.

628
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:11,280
Royal Dragon.. too big company.

629
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,200
Then what do you do?

630
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:18,240
Actually.. you know.. Gujarati
movies are very much in these days..

631
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,400
..so I want to be an actor.

632
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:22,600
Right now, AD and all..
going on.. struggle.

633
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,360
I have seen the struggle.

634
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:32,800
I know.. you must be
feeling I am such a liar.

635
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,640
No.

636
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:41,320
I feel that..
- What do you feel?

637
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:46,200
How long will we be
so formal with each other?

638
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,280
I mean..

639
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,160
You..

640
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:55,080
"The cloud of your
sky goes along with you.."

641
00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:05,720
"The cloud of your
sky goes along with you.."

642
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:15,200
"In the rains of your love,
I want to soak!"

643
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:31,880
"In the rains of your love,
I want to soak!"

644
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:36,040
"Soak!"

645
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,120
"Soak!"

646
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:45,600
"Soak!"

647
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:53,200
"Look how my doll looks!"

648
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,840
"Look how my doll looks!"

649
00:40:56,040 --> 00:41:00,800
Yogi.. our presence or absence
here makes no difference to some people.

650
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,680
Very true!

651
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,280
Our name is not Reema.

652
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,480
But what is it?!

653
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,440
It's your mistake..
you have to pay for it.

654
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:10,800
I don't want to get involved in this.

655
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,400
It's a matter of few days only.

656
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,920
I can sleep anywhere. But please help me.

657
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:16,640
Just a minute.. what is wrong with him?

658
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,400
Like you, he wants to stay in India Lodge.

659
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,080
But he doesn't have a
single penny in his pocket.

660
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,400
Then he is right.
You can't live here, uncle.

661
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,200
No one has the right to live
for free in India Lodge except for us.

662
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,360
What say?!
- You're right.

663
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:29,800
But where will I go.
My house has been locked by them.

664
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,840
Them? Who are them?

665
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,160
VP and his aides.

666
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,360
Why?
- Why?

667
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,680
VP's men..
must be he hasn't repaid his money.

668
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,080
No one dares to keep his money unpaid.

669
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:41,160
Hey! Who is this VP?

670
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,520
How can he throw a
person out of his own home?

671
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,880
Just a minute.
Look uncle.. have some water.

672
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:50,560
Have some water and calmly
tell me what exactly happened.

673
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,720
He is asking for the interest
and principle, both at once.

674
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:56,360
How can I pay him right now?

675
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,280
Whatever it is..
I don't want to get involved with VP.

676
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,160
Hey!

677
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,920
It's just a matter of few days.

678
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:05,120
My wife and son are at her maternal house.

679
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,840
But I can't go and stay there.
- So what can we do?!

680
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,280
Yes.. that is right.

681
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,560
You can't stay there.. not at all.

682
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:16,000
What I say Bhikhu..
go down.. go down for a second.

683
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,880
Stand up.. I have some work.
Come fast.. have some work.

684
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,360
What I was saying is..

685
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,880
Come uncle.

686
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:23,640
These are the room keys.

687
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:26,600
Upstairs, second floor..
left hand side first room. Go.

688
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:29,320
And,, be good. Ok.. be good.

689
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:30,840
Wow! Awesome!

690
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,240
Come.
- Come.. please come.

691
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:34,880
Oh.. he is gone.

692
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,520
My God! My God!

693
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,200
Where is Kishor uncle?

694
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,400
He went away.

695
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,480
Brother Bhikhu..

696
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:46,040
..once you say no,
can anyone dare to step into India Lodge?!

697
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:48,280
Where did he go? Poor fellow took an auto.

698
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,600
You know.. Sister Sarita is just namesake.

699
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,120
Actually Bhikhu is the
one who manages everything.

700
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,040
Right Bhikhu!?

701
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:55,120
Hell with uncle Kishor.

702
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,720
Today, lady's fingers
have been cooked. Is it ok?

703
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:00,400
No way.
- Make some bread too.

704
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:03,200
Come without pushing.. fooling around?!

705
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:05,320
Shall I inform Sarita mother? Shall I?

706
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:06,480
Just rice flakes.

707
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,480
Why have you got this Titanic?

708
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,640
Hollywood?

709
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:15,800
Brother VP..
he is Mr. Henry. He has come from the U.S.

710
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:19,080
Oh.. Henry! Have you got an iphone?

711
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:23,840
What a joke!

712
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,200
I don't have time for jokes, Mr. VP.

713
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,600
This guy has told me that
you could be of some help.

714
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:36,680
And I would really appreciate
if you could get this job done.

715
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:42,200
Please add the sub titles, bro.

716
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,520
Look VP..
- Hey!

717
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:47,640
I mean brother VP..

718
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:51,080
Look.. brother Henry here
wants to buy the India Lodge place.

719
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:52,560
But sister Sarita won't agree.

720
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:53,560
So that place..

721
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:55,360
I have to get that place vacated,
isn't it?

722
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,160
Hey Munna, Chika..

723
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:59,280
Just a minute brother.
Calm down.

724
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:01,800
You just have to talk to Sister Sarita.

725
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,240
You need to make her understand..

726
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:06,520
..that she is getting a good price,
so she should make the deal.

727
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:14,160
10% of the deal will go to me. Agree?

728
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:16,120
He is asking for 10%.

729
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,320
Alright. Deal.

730
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:22,160
It would be good if Sister
Sarita agrees peacefully.

731
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:26,840
Otherwise,
I already have a bad reputation.

732
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:32,520
Kidding.. kidding..

733
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:37,560
I knew that something was fishy!

734
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:41,080
I trust myself and my work very much.

735
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,240
What were you saying..
about the Rickshaw..

736
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,680
Now this uncle Kishor over
here will go in a Rickshaw only.

737
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,080
And also the three of you.

738
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:49,520
Come on.

739
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:51,920
Sister Sarita is waiting
for you downstairs. Meet her.

740
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:54,480
Come on uncle Kishor.. come on.. come!

741
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,920
Trying to fool me?!

742
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:00,080
Come and talk to her so that
you will understand and this topic ends!

743
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:04,920
I didn't know that the three
of you issue the Visa for India Lodge.

744
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:08,840
Aunty, please forget it. We all apologize.

745
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,880
Apologize for what? For what?

746
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:15,640
Don't you always say..
India Lodge is our heritage.

747
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:17,120
Don't you say that all day?

748
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:20,240
There is no bigger good
deed than feeding the hungry and..

749
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:21,720
..giving water to the thirsty.

750
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,280
We have just shared
our roof with uncle Kishor.

751
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:25,320
What is wrong with that?

752
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:29,320
And aunty.. we may perhaps
not understand big philosophy.

753
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,680
But we surely understand that
if a person is in need of help..

754
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,320
..we can't ignore him.

755
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,360
Right.

756
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,760
And this India Lodge is
like a mini India only, isn't it?

757
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:41,440
People of different castes
and creed live together.

758
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:46,600
We thought that even uncle
Kishor would gel in well with us.

759
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:52,400
And didn't you always say that
the whole world is one big family?

760
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,920
And perhaps that is the reason
why you let us live here without paying.

761
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:00,520
We know we made a mistake.

762
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:03,360
But we thought that it
was just a matter of few days..

763
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,280
..so why not let uncle
Kishor stay with us.

764
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:07,400
No, no.. mother they are lying..
- Bhikhu..

765
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:09,360
Feed brother Kishor properly.

766
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:13,880
And the three of you..
next time you are up to something..

767
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,600
..first ask me. I won't refuse.

768
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:21,120
Come in.. come inside.. you are in luck.

769
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:22,200
Yes, but room?

770
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:24,520
Come inside now.. don't be so dramatic.

771
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,240
No drama inside, ok.

772
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:29,920
And the three of you..
why are you standing there? Go.

773
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:40,800
Come on brother.

774
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:46,360
Why have you parked the car in the way?
Leave some space to go..

775
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:54,720
Wherever VP applies the brake,
it's his parking over there.

776
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:56,280
Get it!

777
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:57,800
Come on.

778
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,080
"The gardens are blossoming?"

779
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:02,920
Yes.

780
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:05,000
"The flowers are blooming?"

781
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:05,920
Yes.

782
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:08,400
"I am in love with you.."

783
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:11,360
"No, no.. no, no.. no, no.."

784
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:13,680
Greetings sister Sarita. How are you?

785
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,760
We are meeting after so long, isn't it?

786
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:20,760
I would like it better if
we don't meet for some longer time.

787
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:26,240
Do you welcome guests this way?!

788
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:30,600
Good that I being an insider don't mind.

789
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:35,160
But if you don't offer me tea,
I'll surely be offended.

790
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:37,320
Take, mother.

791
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:39,720
Bhikhu has grown up.

792
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:43,400
But I must say Sister Sarita..

793
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:46,800
The way you're running
India Lodge single handedly..

794
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:48,600
..very good! Very good!

795
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:50,520
Not single handedly.

796
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:52,720
Everyone who lives here supports me.

797
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:57,880
But how long?
How long will you hold on to this place?

798
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:02,600
Your India lodge is like a punctured car.

799
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:09,480
You will get tired pushing this car,
but it won't budge.

800
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:13,240
Now what is the point in bearing a loss?
What say Pinka, Chika?

801
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:14,920
Yes brother. You're right.

802
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:18,440
VP.. VP!

803
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:22,280
The whole area dances to
your tunes and you have started..

804
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:25,120
..dancing to the tunes of that Henry.

805
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:29,360
You have been insulted before all of them!

806
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:36,200
Sister, your tea is good.

807
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:39,600
And so is my mood, today.

808
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:47,000
Accept Henry's deal..
it will be good for all of us.

809
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:50,360
My tea is strong and so is my nature.

810
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:53,280
Tell that to your Henry.

811
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:57,680
Not to waste my time and mood.

812
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:01,880
India Lodge is not for
sale and it will never be.

813
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:06,520
Not for sale.. huh?

814
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:11,000
Come on, Munna..
- Yes brother.

815
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:15,480
Open Facebook and post it.

816
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:19,560
VP feeling rejected with Sarita aunty.

817
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:22,400
Say cheese.
- Smile sister.

818
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:24,600
Cheese..
- Sister, please smile.

819
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:34,440
Good tea.

820
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:40,520
Ok, I take your leave now.

821
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:42,560
When shall we meet again..

822
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:43,760
Come on!

823
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:56,360
Even with shut eyes,
I can recognize my son!

824
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:57,680
Damn it, mom!

825
00:50:57,880 --> 00:50:59,360
How are you? Seek your blessings.

826
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:00,600
Slowly dear.

827
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:02,920
My son!
- Yeah.

828
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:05,320
You've lost so much weight.

829
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:08,600
Oh mom! But you're still the same.

830
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:12,280
You were supposed to come day
before yesterday, isn't it? - Yeah.

831
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:14,360
I would have sent Bhikhu to
airport if you had informed earlier.

832
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:16,040
Surprise mom!

833
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:17,720
Forget all that.

834
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:21,040
Now tell me when are you
going to leave this haunted house?

835
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:23,600
It may be a haunted house for you..

836
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:28,120
..but for me it's a temple.

837
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:30,200
Mom, you still haven't changed.

838
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:32,480
Come on.. you've come after so long.

839
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:36,760
I'll make 'Sukhdi' (sweet dish) for you.
- Yes. But less Ghee, ok.

840
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:38,200
You know I am not used to it, right.

841
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:39,600
You have changed completely.

842
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:42,400
I have become an American, mom!

843
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:43,400
What American!

844
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:44,280
You add too much Ghee to 'Sukhdi'.

845
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:46,840
Hey! Captain America.
- What?!

846
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:50,480
India Lodge's most notorious
and my favorite kids!

847
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:52,920
Jay, Janvi and Yogesh.

848
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:55,360
Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

849
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:57,720
And he is my son, Aniket.
- Hi.

850
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:00,000
Has he come just like that
or has Trump thrown him out?!

851
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:02,280
What?!

852
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:04,160
Jay! He loves to fool around.

853
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:07,120
Not a good habit.

854
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:14,840
Aniket.. you know even
Jay is fond of sword fighting.

855
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:18,120
Mom.. I am not fond of sword fighting..
I am a champion.

856
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:19,440
Right.

857
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:24,040
Well.. let's have a quick round then.

858
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,720
Aniket.. you can do this
sword fighting in America.

859
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:29,240
You very well know I don't like all this!

860
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:31,120
Relax mom.. I won't kill him.

861
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,160
Aniket!

862
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,360
Aniket!

863
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:20,280
You're good. But I am the best.

864
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:22,800
Better luck next time.

865
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:28,200
What's wrong with him?

866
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:34,680
Sorry, sorry, sorry!
Brother had some work.

867
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:36,240
Damn your brother!

868
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:38,560
What about my brother!? What?

869
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:40,880
He is my friend.. you know!

870
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:42,640
That's better.

871
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:44,520
Now tell me what work do you have?

872
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:46,600
Can't stand here for long.
Tell me quickly.

873
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:48,680
You know.. do something quickly.

874
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:51,720
Give me a good night kiss.
Then I will leave.

875
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:53,720
Good night kiss? Over here?

876
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:55,560
What if somebody sees?

877
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:57,920
No one will see.
Just one kiss. Then I'll leave.

878
00:54:58,040 --> 00:55:00,320
Ok, just one kiss right?
Surely you'll leave afterwards right?

879
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:02,440
Umm..
- Ok, bye.

880
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:03,560
No.. no..

881
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:08,480
Promise.. I'll leave after I get a kiss.

882
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:09,480
Sure?

883
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:15,640
Reema!

884
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,200
Quiet! Go inside!

885
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:22,880
Reema, go inside!

886
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:24,920
Brother, you..

887
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:26,800
What? What?!
- At least listen to me..

888
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:28,880
There is nothing left to listen now!

889
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:30,480
I have seen with my very own eyes.

890
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,320
Brother, we were going to tell you..

891
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:33,720
Tell me what?!

892
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:35,720
My sister and my friend?!

893
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:37,240
Just a minute Jackie.

894
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:38,480
Jackie, I..

895
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:40,720
I'll never forgive you.
Come on!

896
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:42,440
Jackie..
- Don't come here again!

897
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:43,720
Come on..
- Brother.. brother..

898
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:44,880
Reema..
- Brother, at least listen..

899
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:47,560
I don't want to hear anything!
Come on. What is all this?!

900
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:50,400
Brother, at least listen to me once.

901
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:52,760
You're just dragging me away..

902
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:55,320
Look.. you're looking so sweet here.

903
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:56,480
My baby!

904
00:55:57,240 --> 00:56:00,160
And look here..
your eyes are shining so bright!

905
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:01,360
Right.

906
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:03,440
Look, you're playing with your cap on.

907
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:08,240
Honestly mom..
I am not at all interested in seeing..

908
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:10,000
..these albums and photos.

909
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:16,200
I feel that these things
don't let us come out of our past.

910
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:19,800
For example.. this.. your India Lodge.

911
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:21,760
You can't let it go.

912
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:26,920
You're also stuck in the same time as it.

913
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:30,440
I thought that I would never
have to explain this to you.

914
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:32,680
Ok. I don't even want to listen.

915
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:36,000
Leave all this and come with me to US.

916
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:38,400
We'll live there peacefully.

917
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:40,320
One who sells his heritage..

918
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,600
..which corner of earth
can he get peace, son?

919
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:48,840
Ok. There is no point
in arguing with you, mom.

920
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:54,320
Oh yes.. I forgot to tell you.

921
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:57,880
Last time you came to US,
we got a joint account started, remember?

922
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:01,200
I want your sign on some of the papers.

923
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:11,040
Be happy with this place of yours, mom.

924
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:15,880
After I go,
all this will belong to you only.

925
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:19,720
Right.
- You have to take care of everything.

926
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:20,920
Ok.

927
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:24,920
It is our culture and tradition.

928
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:27,600
Have you signed?
- Yes.

929
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:29,360
Take.

930
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:32,240
Thank you.

931
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:38,640
Brother Aniket..
- Yes. Coming.

932
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:40,880
Ok mom, the cab is here. I'll leave.

933
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:43,840
You're going a week earlier, ok.
- Mom..

934
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:45,680
There is so much work load.
I'll have to go.

935
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:47,920
And now, you have to come, ok.

936
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:50,080
You haven't come after
I shifted to the new house.

937
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:52,760
Come on.. be quick brother Aniket.
- Coming.

938
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:57,120
Listen son..
have packed some sweets. Have them.

939
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:59,080
Mom, how many times
have I told you not to!

940
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:00,880
Ok, I'll eat it. Happy.

941
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:02,360
Take care.
- Brother Aniket..

942
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:03,240
Wait a minute.

943
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:08,080
Come on.. come on fast.. fast..
- Bye mom!

944
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:10,600
I have checked your luggage
and kept it inside. Ok.

945
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:13,360
Don't worry. Bye! Bye!

946
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:14,800
Bye! Bye! Bye! Bye!

947
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:18,640
I have just lost it!

948
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:21,400
First of all,
Reema is not speaking to me..

949
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:23,400
..and this Jackie fellow!

950
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:25,760
Making a mountain out of a molehill!

951
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:27,240
He won't even look at me!

952
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:32,200
Just fill it up!

953
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:35,600
What a life!
I am fed up now trying to convince him.

954
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:45,560
I am tired of convincing him.

955
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:53,160
Kanhaiyya.. hey! Get up!

956
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:56,240
Kanhaiyya, we still have studies left!

957
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:03,480
Kanhaiyya.. hey..

958
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:07,080
How will you value the worker
when you don't even know his name!?

959
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:08,160
Enough!

960
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:11,280
You're working for me.
I am not working for you!

961
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:14,800
Ok! I am your boss.
So don't question me ever again.

962
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:22,760
What is it..

963
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:26,360
Brother.. slow down.

964
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:38,240
This bottle..
life is even cheaper than it!

965
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:43,680
Me and Kanhaiyya.. both were fools.

966
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:46,920
I thought I would educate him.

967
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:50,280
So that he could be something worthwhile.

968
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:52,560
So that he would be valued.

969
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:56,720
And he thought that I would protect him.

970
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:00,520
Both were fools.

971
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,320
Look Janvi.. to progress in this field..

972
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:08,680
..you will need right
support and guidance.

973
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:17,880
By the way, you people know that..

974
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,640
..all this is not allowed in India Lodge,
don't you?

975
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:21,360
Here! Then why are you drinking?

976
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:25,160
I quit my job.

977
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:30,640
Yes.. I finally finished
that moron's case.

978
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:33,240
Please don't ask me the details.

979
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:35,200
I am out of my mind right now.

980
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:41,200
Hey! I think all three of us
have a network problem with our stars.

981
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:42,320
I swear.

982
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:44,640
These problems keep
coming one after the other!

983
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:51,040
I had already lost my job..

984
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:53,600
..and now my personal life
has gone down the drain too.

985
01:00:57,160 --> 01:00:59,360
There is no reason to say cheers!

986
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:03,720
Yogi, fill the glass.

987
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:05,200
Fill it.

988
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:16,520
Hey Jay..
- Tell me.

989
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:20,280
Reema loves you a lot.

990
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:21,680
It is not the girl's fault.

991
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:23,920
She just talks big.

992
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:26,640
I know that you love Reema a lot.

993
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:28,680
We got hitched at a Chinese food stall!

994
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:30,160
Really!?

995
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:32,280
No one but I have a partner!

996
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:39,360
That Jackie..
is not actually Chinese, but Punjabi!

997
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:44,200
He is smart.
No one can make out. Just I know it.

998
01:01:44,680 --> 01:01:45,920
But I like his sister a lot.

999
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:47,840
We'll kidnap Reema and get her here.

1000
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:49,200
Everyone thought that
since Jackie is Chinese..

1001
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:50,400
..his sister would be Chinese too.

1002
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:52,200
Stop it now!

1003
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:54,880
But Jackie's friendship
is real friendship!

1004
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:58,120
Come on.. come on,
let's go and wake everyone up.

1005
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:01,320
You really want to do it.. really?

1006
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:02,320
Cheers!

1007
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:03,520
Not the right time to wake all!

1008
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:07,040
And Reema is not talking to me because..
I really want..

1009
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:08,440
Because everything is fine.

1010
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:10,440
Good.. good..

1011
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:13,840
Go and try to..
- "Pigeon go away.."

1012
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:14,880
I really..

1013
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:18,280
Really.. my whole world is here.

1014
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:22,200
Come on now..
let's go and wake up entire India Lodge.

1015
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:23,520
Very good.. very good..

1016
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:25,480
Come on. Don't just talk.

1017
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:27,840
Chatty girl..

1018
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:31,480
"Pigeon come.. come.."

1019
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:35,360
You escaped..

1020
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:37,560
Sister Sarita, I am coming!

1021
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:39,560
Sister Sarita..

1022
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:42,360
Door.. open the door!

1023
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:43,400
Uncle..

1024
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:45,640
Touching your feet.. Bless me! Bless me!

1025
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:49,000
I have got the blessings.
She will come.. she will come..

1026
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:51,360
Hey Bhikhu..
- Very good.. very good.

1027
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:53,120
Where is Sarita aunty?
- Give me the bottle..

1028
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:57,680
This bottle.. it is like uncle Kishor.

1029
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:00,600
I am done. My quota for today is over.

1030
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:02,800
Look at my mattress, it has holes!

1031
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:04,560
Have a mattress with holes.

1032
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:27,240
Where are we sleeping?

1033
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:29,160
Did we drink out here?

1034
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:35,080
Damn!

1035
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:38,840
Get up.

1036
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:49,840
Brother.. brother.. get up.

1037
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:54,360
Look.. look before you.

1038
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:58,080
Look..

1039
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:13,120
Stand straight.

1040
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:21,040
One hour.. you all have one hour.

1041
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:26,040
Whatever luggage you have,
pack it and leave from here.

1042
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:29,480
Listen to us.. actually..
- Shut up!

1043
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:32,320
Don't say a word!

1044
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:36,080
They are children..
they may make mistakes.

1045
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:38,160
I tolerated everything
you did thinking so.

1046
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:42,840
But not anymore. One hour.

1047
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,840
But Sister Sarita..
- Aunty..

1048
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:47,240
Damn!

1049
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:54,560
Hell!
- Hell!

1050
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:43,840
Have a good laugh bro..
melody is chocolatey!

1051
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:53,800
Siri..

1052
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:56,320
See the number.

1053
01:05:58,160 --> 01:05:59,080
Hello..

1054
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:01,840
Yes.. yes..

1055
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:09,720
Will be done.

1056
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,200
Yes, ok.

1057
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:14,600
Glory to Mother Goddess!

1058
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:20,480
Munna, Chika..
- Yes brother.

1059
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:24,240
You have to help sister
Sarita do packing. Go.

1060
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:37,720
Hey Gandhigiri..
- Who is he?

1061
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:42,480
Two hours.. I want this India
Lodge vacated within two hours.

1062
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:45,320
Else I and my men will get it vacated.

1063
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:47,200
Don't you people your people
understand when told once?

1064
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:49,120
India Lodge is not for sale.

1065
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:50,240
Shall I give it in writing?

1066
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:52,360
We have India Lodge written off..

1067
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:54,680
..to Henry's company.

1068
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:01,160
Your son has made a deal with us.

1069
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:03,080
And he has eloped with the money.

1070
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:06,440
Now, if you don't vacate
this India Lodge within two hours..

1071
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:09,520
..then even me and my
men don't know what we will do!

1072
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:39,360
Oh God!

1073
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:41,080
Listen.. India Lodge!

1074
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:43,160
VP's men..

1075
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:44,800
What are you saying?!
- Hurry up!

1076
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:46,160
Hurry.. - Come on.
- Come!

1077
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:10,720
Hit them! Throw that!

1078
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:46,280
Get out from there!

1079
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,720
What is this brother?!
Coming to our house without invitation?

1080
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:10,560
But now that you're here, have tea and go!

1081
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:13,840
So many have been finished
by Gandhigiri here!

1082
01:10:32,680 --> 01:10:34,720
Hit him! Hit him!

1083
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:35,840
Hit him Munna!

1084
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:35,840
Hey..

1085
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:51,680
Come on fast.

1086
01:12:56,520 --> 01:12:58,320
Move! Move!

1087
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:36,760
Just a minute.. just a minute..

1088
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:39,760
Why are we going there?
This is not our house!

1089
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:42,240
We have no right to stay in India Lodge!

1090
01:13:42,440 --> 01:13:43,600
Why should we stay here?

1091
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:46,560
We were given only one hour.. weren't we?

1092
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:48,680
Come on.. get going.

1093
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:50,680
We'll go and stay
somewhere in Italy or so.

1094
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:52,440
Why stay here!
Come on, start wailing.

1095
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,400
Just a minute.

1096
01:13:55,240 --> 01:13:57,760
Your room is this way. Go!

1097
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:05,200
My kids!

1098
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:37,800
Aunty.. aunty please keep your eyes open.

1099
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:41,440
We won't let anything happen to you.

1100
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:42,800
Hey! Side please.. side please..

1101
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:43,840
Jay!

1102
01:14:57,800 --> 01:14:59,280
Doctor..
- Doctor sir..

1103
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:01,200
She doesn't have much time left.

1104
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:02,920
You can call her family members.

1105
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:04,560
Doctor, we are only her family.

1106
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:06,920
You are? Then you can go in.
- Yes, yes.

1107
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:09,200
Come on.. hurry up.
- Sister, keep the oxygen ready.

1108
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:13,840
Mother.. mother.. mother..

1109
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:14,840
Aunty..

1110
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:32,280
India Lodge..

1111
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:33,800
Aunty..

1112
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:36,200
Yes aunty..
- We won't let anything happen.

1113
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:40,640
Nothing will happen to our Lodge.

1114
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:42,880
We are here.

1115
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:45,760
We won't let anything
happen to India Lodge.

1116
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:03,280
Aunty..
- Mother..

1117
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:12,120
Sarita aunty!

1118
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:20,120
Mother..

1119
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:33,160
Go and pray before
Sarita aunty's photo, ok.

1120
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:39,920
Take this.

1121
01:16:47,240 --> 01:16:48,520
What happened was very bad!

1122
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:54,760
She was a very good human.

1123
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:57,800
She dedicated her entire life.

1124
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:02,120
Soft face, shining eyes..

1125
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:06,360
And she just left us alone and went away.

1126
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:14,920
I am so proud of her.

1127
01:17:16,280 --> 01:17:18,360
I mean I was.

1128
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:26,480
Have we met before?

1129
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:33,440
If we had met,
you wouldn't have forgotten.

1130
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:36,240
Ask your aides!

1131
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:43,160
Is it something with this place that..

1132
01:17:43,240 --> 01:17:44,800
..everyone just has such hot temper or..

1133
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:46,880
..is something the matter with me.

1134
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:51,240
Hey brother VP..
a man like you won't understand..

1135
01:17:52,240 --> 01:17:54,280
..what is there in this place.

1136
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:59,920
Sonny, I never understand.

1137
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:02,560
I make people understand.

1138
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:06,600
Lovingly..

1139
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:11,440
But you better understand VP..

1140
01:18:11,880 --> 01:18:17,280
If you send cars and men henceforth..
we will puncture..

1141
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:19,120
..both.

1142
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:24,080
Sister Sarita's three monkeys
seem to be flying in air!

1143
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:28,520
We will meet soon. Come on.

1144
01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:30,640
It would be better that we don't meet..

1145
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:32,280
..VP.

1146
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:41,560
Because this India Lodge
is now our responsibility.

1147
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,920
It would be better that we don't meet.

1148
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:48,360
I am scared!

1149
01:18:48,440 --> 01:18:49,360
Hey! Be scared! Be scared!

1150
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:50,760
I am so scared, brother!

1151
01:18:52,280 --> 01:18:55,840
"We are travelers of love..
don't say anything to us."

1152
01:18:55,920 --> 01:19:00,800
"Whoever meets us with love, we..
belong to them."

1153
01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:05,120
Come on.

1154
01:19:27,160 --> 01:19:31,000
Sister Sarita has transferred
India Lodge to their name.

1155
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:34,200
She had changed her will in the hospital.

1156
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:47,720
And now, you have to
take care of India Lodge.

1157
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:49,920
And these are its original papers.

1158
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:51,240
Thank you.

1159
01:19:57,440 --> 01:20:00,080
Thank you.
- Welcome.

1160
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:10,440
Pull it quickly.
- Give..

1161
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:20,240
Hey Bhikhu..

1162
01:20:47,480 --> 01:20:48,840
Reema..

1163
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:51,200
What is it?!

1164
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:56,240
He won't reply!
He calls out and doesn't reply.

1165
01:20:56,760 --> 01:20:58,080
Reema.. what happened?

1166
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:01,160
Why won't you take my calls?

1167
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:02,880
I haven't done anything like that..

1168
01:21:07,480 --> 01:21:09,920
Jackie is also here.. what is it?

1169
01:21:14,440 --> 01:21:15,760
Why are you avoiding me?

1170
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:18,240
Nothing like that
has happened between us..

1171
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:19,640
..so why are you not talking to me.

1172
01:21:19,720 --> 01:21:22,160
Yes, nothing has happened.
But now it will happen.

1173
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:23,840
What say? It will happen now.

1174
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:27,520
And it will happen in such a way,
that we both will stop talking.

1175
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:30,600
Take this. Read it.

1176
01:21:32,200 --> 01:21:33,040
What is it?

1177
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:37,440
Invitation card. My invitation card.

1178
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:41,040
Your invitation card?!
- You moron!

1179
01:21:41,160 --> 01:21:43,320
What did you think..
it is a Bollywood movie going on?

1180
01:21:43,400 --> 01:21:45,440
So that I would get Reema's
wedding card and invite you!

1181
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:47,560
Who did you find at this age, pal?!

1182
01:21:47,640 --> 01:21:49,920
I'll give you one tight one, rascal!

1183
01:21:50,040 --> 01:21:52,000
Hey.. actually you are my brother-in-law.

1184
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:53,800
You know what..
- Yes, tell me.

1185
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:55,360
You're right.

1186
01:21:55,680 --> 01:21:57,320
We should have told you.

1187
01:21:57,440 --> 01:22:00,440
What is right and wrong..
forget everything.

1188
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:04,440
And as it is.. who can be
better than my best friend for Reema?

1189
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:09,280
Damn you! You're such a nonsensical item!

1190
01:22:09,880 --> 01:22:11,240
Oh!

1191
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:17,560
Great going!

1192
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:24,520
Thought that everything will
go back to normal in India Lodge now.

1193
01:22:25,680 --> 01:22:27,800
But I knew something was fishy.

1194
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:31,240
VP would not give up so easily.

1195
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:32,200
Come on.

1196
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:36,360
His men used all kinds of tactics!

1197
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:39,640
They cut our light supply,
grocery supply and everything else.

1198
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:42,840
And then.. gradually..
everyone living in India Lodge..

1199
01:22:42,920 --> 01:22:44,400
..started getting threats.

1200
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:45,720
At this age when you should be an umpire..

1201
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:48,440
..why are you trying to bat in our game!

1202
01:22:48,920 --> 01:22:50,920
You'll get clean bowled!

1203
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:55,640
Look.. even sister went up into pavilion.
Didn't she?

1204
01:22:55,880 --> 01:22:59,440
So try to understand.
And make others understand too.

1205
01:22:59,560 --> 01:23:00,640
Yes.

1206
01:23:02,040 --> 01:23:03,760
Yes, yes.

1207
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:05,400
Bhikhu, did you talk to Aniket?

1208
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:07,040
No. His phone is not reachable.

1209
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:10,440
And who shot the bullet and how..
still the police are investigating!

1210
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:13,680
Uncle..
- Iqbal uncle.. where are you off to?

1211
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:16,720
What happened?
- Brother, we need peace.

1212
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:18,760
We don't want to get into any trouble.

1213
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:21,240
But since when have you
started feeling anxious over here?

1214
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:25,120
Since you messed with VP's men.

1215
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:31,080
You know.. VP's men snatched
all my money in the middle of the street.

1216
01:23:31,320 --> 01:23:35,800
And they threatened me
that I should leave India Lodge.

1217
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:39,920
I see. So that is why you
have packed your bags and going.

1218
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:44,560
Uncle, you proved more 'Himmatwala'
(courageous) than even Jitendra.

1219
01:23:44,920 --> 01:23:47,120
There is a difference between
courage and foolishness.

1220
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:49,120
Something that feels
like courage at your age..

1221
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:50,880
..is foolishness at our age.

1222
01:23:51,080 --> 01:23:55,280
Yes. And as it is,
they have the legal papers, right.

1223
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:58,400
Brother Aniket has signed them.

1224
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:04,920
Some day or the other,
India Lodge is sure to go to them.

1225
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:08,000
And what about the papers
that aunty Sarita signed?

1226
01:24:08,280 --> 01:24:10,200
Aren't we responsible for this place now?

1227
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:14,000
Sister has gone.

1228
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:18,440
And she has paid the price.

1229
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:21,640
We don't want to pay that price, ok.

1230
01:24:22,040 --> 01:24:24,920
And I would advise you also..

1231
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:27,800
Don't go deeper into this matter.

1232
01:24:27,880 --> 01:24:29,720
Uncle, we are already
deep into the matter.

1233
01:24:30,360 --> 01:24:31,920
We just need to finish it off now.

1234
01:24:33,080 --> 01:24:36,840
If you all support us, fine.
Else we will fight ourselves.

1235
01:24:38,280 --> 01:24:43,040
Just some troubles faced in life
and the whole lot packs bags and runs!

1236
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:46,880
Good that Gandhiji didn't
come across people like you.

1237
01:24:47,480 --> 01:24:49,720
Otherwise,
our country wouldn't have freedom today.

1238
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:53,600
When you didn't have any shelter,
everyone came here running.

1239
01:24:54,120 --> 01:24:56,160
When you had self interests,
you found support here.

1240
01:24:56,240 --> 01:24:57,200
Right Kishor uncle?

1241
01:24:57,640 --> 01:25:00,360
And now, when this
place needs your support..

1242
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:02,280
..you still are thinking
of your self-interests.

1243
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:14,520
Got hit! Gently!

1244
01:25:52,040 --> 01:25:57,120
Listen uncle Kishor.. listen uncle Desai..

1245
01:25:58,080 --> 01:25:59,760
Enough. Forgive us.

1246
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:01,640
Don't worry. We are here.
- Come on, brothers.

1247
01:26:01,720 --> 01:26:03,600
Forgive us.
- Come on, uncle Desai.

1248
01:26:03,680 --> 01:26:07,640
Come on brother Kishor.. it is
very risky to stay in India Lodge now.

1249
01:26:08,040 --> 01:26:09,280
What shall we do now?

1250
01:26:10,600 --> 01:26:12,040
I think we should go to the court.

1251
01:26:12,640 --> 01:26:14,480
I think our case is very strong.

1252
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:16,640
So our chances of winning are also good.

1253
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:19,760
But what about the papers that they have?

1254
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:22,120
I know. But..
- They won't let go.

1255
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:25,040
Aniket has made a very big deal.

1256
01:26:25,160 --> 01:26:26,480
And now he has disappeared.

1257
01:26:27,720 --> 01:26:29,680
Look, I am filing a case immediately.

1258
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:35,360
And if we win the case, Henry and VP
won't have any other option but back out.

1259
01:26:35,640 --> 01:26:36,560
Trust me.

1260
01:26:37,480 --> 01:26:38,920
That's what will happen Sister Janvi.

1261
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:40,840
Really.. really..

1262
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:51,320
Brother, Sister Sarita has
transferred the property papers..

1263
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:53,320
..to those three punters.

1264
01:26:54,320 --> 01:26:56,880
So now, they are feeling very confident.

1265
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:01,880
I want those papers.

1266
01:27:04,760 --> 01:27:08,320
But brother, who out of the three
has the papers and where they are..

1267
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:09,680
..how will we know.

1268
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:15,200
Then we will tell them lovingly..

1269
01:27:16,520 --> 01:27:17,760
..to give the papers.

1270
01:27:20,240 --> 01:27:21,480
And they will return.

1271
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:23,600
What say..

1272
01:27:27,160 --> 01:27:28,040
Give.

1273
01:27:38,680 --> 01:27:40,080
Hello..

1274
01:27:40,160 --> 01:27:44,800
Hello.. hello.. when I am on a call..

1275
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:48,720
Here.. here.. I have got Reema.

1276
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:50,360
Jay!
- Hey Reema!

1277
01:27:50,680 --> 01:27:51,480
Jay!

1278
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:54,120
Hey! You're talking to Jay!

1279
01:27:54,920 --> 01:27:56,680
If anything happens to Reema..

1280
01:27:56,760 --> 01:28:01,720
Then what? Will you chop me
into tiny pieces and feed them to dogs?!

1281
01:28:03,040 --> 01:28:07,760
Sonny.. everyone fears VP so much,
even the dogs will go on a fast.

1282
01:28:08,040 --> 01:28:09,080
What do you want, tell me!

1283
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:11,400
What do you want.. just tell me!

1284
01:28:11,800 --> 01:28:15,560
Paper.. I want papers
signed by sister Sarita.

1285
01:28:16,120 --> 01:28:18,680
Bring them to me and take away Reema.

1286
01:28:18,920 --> 01:28:23,640
And yes.. don't get those
two monkeys along with you.

1287
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:25,360
Ok.

1288
01:28:34,920 --> 01:28:36,840
Jay.. what are you doing?!

1289
01:28:37,560 --> 01:28:39,240
Nothing.. I'll just come..

1290
01:28:39,320 --> 01:28:41,240
Hey! Hey! But at least listen to me..

1291
01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:52,880
When I say, pull this up.

1292
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:59,000
"This is the effect of intoxicated eyes!"

1293
01:28:59,640 --> 01:29:01,920
"This effect sounds intoxicating!"

1294
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:03,720
Let Jay come and then he will show you!

1295
01:29:03,800 --> 01:29:06,520
"The by lanes and streets
have become sweet like honey!"

1296
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:07,880
"Sweet like honey!"
- Jay!!

1297
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:10,800
"The skies and clouds are rosy.."

1298
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:11,440
Hey! Where are you going?!

1299
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:13,560
"The seven seas are rosy.."

1300
01:29:13,720 --> 01:29:15,360
"The sun dial is rosy.."

1301
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:16,560
Hey! Stop here.

1302
01:29:16,640 --> 01:29:18,640
"Hey companion.."

1303
01:29:19,320 --> 01:29:21,120
Thank you..
- Jay.. save me!

1304
01:29:21,320 --> 01:29:23,160
Wow! Amazing!
- Jay, please save me!

1305
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:24,600
Very bad!

1306
01:29:24,720 --> 01:29:26,360
Hey Munna..
- Yes brother..

1307
01:29:26,840 --> 01:29:29,120
Open Facebook and post it.
- Okay!

1308
01:29:30,240 --> 01:29:34,200
VP feeling.. romantic.

1309
01:29:34,840 --> 01:29:35,840
Jay..

1310
01:29:36,160 --> 01:29:37,360
I have come alone.

1311
01:29:39,560 --> 01:29:41,080
Hey! He really came alone!

1312
01:29:41,440 --> 01:29:45,120
I thought you three
came together in the offer.

1313
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:46,360
Two free on one!

1314
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:51,880
You have done something very good,
brother VP.. very nice!

1315
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:54,560
You did the right thing by kidnapping her.
- Jay!

1316
01:29:54,720 --> 01:29:57,080
She has made my life hell!
- Jay, what are you saying?!

1317
01:29:57,120 --> 01:29:59,480
All day she goes on and on..
Jay, Chika, Munna etc.. etc..

1318
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:02,400
Sir, you'll get fed up of her.

1319
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:03,920
She keeps harassing me too.

1320
01:30:04,040 --> 01:30:06,280
Sir.. here.. over here!

1321
01:30:06,360 --> 01:30:08,440
Forget her! Else you'll regret.

1322
01:30:09,360 --> 01:30:12,440
I'll let her go. I'll let her go.

1323
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:15,000
But papers in exchange for Reema.
- What are you doing?

1324
01:30:15,080 --> 01:30:17,640
Didn't we make a deal? Didn't we?

1325
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:18,880
Yes.

1326
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:24,480
Now the problem is that,
I'll have to call those two also here.

1327
01:30:25,880 --> 01:30:33,000
So that I can close the
accounts of all three of you here.

1328
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:34,200
I see.

1329
01:30:34,360 --> 01:30:35,600
Do you have a drawstring in your pants?

1330
01:30:35,920 --> 01:30:38,160
If there is,
fasten it otherwise your pants will drop.

1331
01:30:40,920 --> 01:30:42,200
Brother.. brother..

1332
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:43,800
Was this slap serious
or were you just kidding?

1333
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:47,200
Jay!

1334
01:30:49,080 --> 01:30:51,360
I was just kidding.
- Then hit me seriously.

1335
01:30:51,440 --> 01:30:52,440
So that I get into the fight mood.

1336
01:30:52,520 --> 01:30:53,760
Hey Chika..
- Yes brother.

1337
01:30:54,200 --> 01:30:59,120
Come on now.. call him and
tell that brother Jay's life is midway.

1338
01:30:59,680 --> 01:31:02,400
They shouldn't come until
their life's life doesn't leave him.

1339
01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:03,800
Ok.
- Call them and tell.

1340
01:31:04,480 --> 01:31:05,840
And take the papers.

1341
01:31:07,360 --> 01:31:11,040
Jay! Jay!

1342
01:31:12,440 --> 01:31:14,920
Reema.. save me! Reema save me!

1343
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:16,360
Jay!

1344
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:19,200
I am finished!

1345
01:31:19,360 --> 01:31:20,400
Jay!

1346
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:22,320
Finish him off.

1347
01:31:22,520 --> 01:31:25,040
Jay! Jay!

1348
01:31:29,440 --> 01:31:30,600
Jay!

1349
01:31:36,720 --> 01:31:37,920
Jay!

1350
01:31:46,040 --> 01:31:47,120
Jai..
- Janvi..

1351
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:48,520
Yogesh..

1352
01:31:59,880 --> 01:32:01,760
Yogesh.. Janvi..

1353
01:32:02,040 --> 01:32:03,600
At least send the location perfectly.

1354
01:32:03,680 --> 01:32:05,360
You had a narrow escape!

1355
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:06,920
Jay, save me.

1356
01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:56,480
Jay!

1357
01:33:00,600 --> 01:33:01,760
Up here, Jay!

1358
01:33:06,120 --> 01:33:07,320
Hit him!

1359
01:33:26,520 --> 01:33:28,360
She is down safely!

1360
01:33:28,440 --> 01:33:29,920
You just shut up! Don't talk to me.

1361
01:33:30,080 --> 01:33:31,920
Let me go!
- Don't say that, dear! Never!

1362
01:33:32,080 --> 01:33:33,880
Don't be angry!
- I don't want to talk to you.

1363
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:35,800
Come on fast..
- I don't want to talk to you.

1364
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:37,160
Janvi.. thanks dear.

1365
01:33:37,240 --> 01:33:38,320
Look she is sweating so much.
- You go!

1366
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:39,520
She looks so good.
- Go away!

1367
01:33:40,080 --> 01:33:43,480
A kidnapping now! Are you serious?

1368
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,600
Which part of..
I want to get this done quietly!!

1369
01:33:46,680 --> 01:33:48,200
You didn't understand!

1370
01:33:49,880 --> 01:33:51,280
Why is he so furious, brother?

1371
01:33:51,480 --> 01:33:53,800
Brother VP, why did this
matter escalate to kidnapping?

1372
01:33:54,240 --> 01:33:56,080
And still the papers are with them only.

1373
01:33:56,440 --> 01:33:57,880
So all this was just a waste.

1374
01:33:58,080 --> 01:33:59,120
What to do about it now?

1375
01:33:59,200 --> 01:34:00,840
Wait.. I'll explain to him.

1376
01:34:01,120 --> 01:34:04,000
Look brother Henry.. I'll explain.

1377
01:34:04,440 --> 01:34:07,080
Papers were inside the bag.

1378
01:34:07,240 --> 01:34:09,280
And when we were taking them and leaving..

1379
01:34:09,560 --> 01:34:11,840
Don't worry.. papers I'll give..
- Hey! It's too much now!

1380
01:34:11,880 --> 01:34:12,880
Too much!

1381
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:17,200
You've done enough damage.
I'll do it my way now.

1382
01:34:18,200 --> 01:34:19,400
Let's go Bhavesh.

1383
01:34:25,560 --> 01:34:26,600
Let's go.

1384
01:34:32,680 --> 01:34:35,400
Didn't I tell you to
take the papers and leave?

1385
01:34:37,520 --> 01:34:40,440
This is the first time anyone
has raised his voice before VP.

1386
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:46,000
Now I'll have to find a solution for this.

1387
01:34:46,760 --> 01:34:47,920
Come on.

1388
01:34:51,120 --> 01:34:53,560
You were acting too smart, isn't it?
You were laughing so much, right!

1389
01:34:53,640 --> 01:34:54,480
She was looking awesome!

1390
01:34:54,560 --> 01:34:57,040
What did you say?!
You did a good job kidnapping her, right?!

1391
01:34:57,120 --> 01:34:59,640
I have made your life hell.
You're fed up of me!

1392
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:02,440
Then go away..
why have you come back? Go away!

1393
01:35:02,520 --> 01:35:04,560
Guys, guys.. just a minute.
- Yes?

1394
01:35:04,840 --> 01:35:06,320
We have got the court dates.

1395
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:07,680
Wow.. very good.

1396
01:35:08,360 --> 01:35:11,720
So we will fight in the court
and if necessary out of court too.

1397
01:35:11,800 --> 01:35:12,840
Yes!

1398
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:21,360
I don't care what you do, Bhavesh.
But I can't lose this case.

1399
01:35:22,920 --> 01:35:24,600
Too much is on stake.

1400
01:35:25,320 --> 01:35:26,760
Don't worry, Mr. Henry.

1401
01:35:27,800 --> 01:35:30,920
I still feel we're on a stronger side.

1402
01:35:32,280 --> 01:35:34,360
You'll get your India Lodge very soon.

1403
01:35:39,040 --> 01:35:41,160
Let's just hope for the best.

1404
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:43,080
Yeah.. thank God!

1405
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:45,360
But what time are you landing?

1406
01:35:45,680 --> 01:35:48,080
Ho ho! Ms. Janvi is on the rush!

1407
01:35:50,080 --> 01:35:51,200
Excuse me.

1408
01:35:51,560 --> 01:35:55,280
This case is a waste of time.
Let's be wise.

1409
01:35:55,480 --> 01:35:56,600
Let's compromise.

1410
01:35:56,680 --> 01:35:58,640
Do I smell the fear of defeat?

1411
01:35:59,360 --> 01:36:03,040
Fear! India is a country of losers.

1412
01:36:03,240 --> 01:36:04,840
You don't know how to rule.

1413
01:36:04,920 --> 01:36:06,760
You only know how to serve.

1414
01:36:07,360 --> 01:36:08,800
And that's what I am going to do.

1415
01:36:09,480 --> 01:36:11,520
Make your Indians work here.

1416
01:36:12,520 --> 01:36:16,680
Like slaves..
while I make billions of dollars!

1417
01:36:16,920 --> 01:36:19,160
To hell with you!

1418
01:36:26,360 --> 01:36:30,120
I'll see you in court!
- Yes.

1419
01:36:32,800 --> 01:36:35,680
Yes. But this is an open and shut case.

1420
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:37,000
Did you hear that?

1421
01:36:40,120 --> 01:36:42,040
Sir I want to call my last witness.

1422
01:36:59,160 --> 01:37:01,160
Have you sold India Lodge to Henry?

1423
01:37:01,880 --> 01:37:04,360
Your honor.. this is not my sign.

1424
01:37:11,560 --> 01:37:15,640
India Lodge is not
and will never be for sale.

1425
01:37:19,040 --> 01:37:21,120
He himself admitted
that it is not his sign.

1426
01:37:21,400 --> 01:37:25,080
And when it is not his sign,
there is no point in this case.

1427
01:37:30,520 --> 01:37:32,520
Wow! Well done!

1428
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:43,680
So.. what next?

1429
01:37:46,200 --> 01:37:50,160
I don't know.
But now, even mom is no more.

1430
01:37:51,040 --> 01:37:54,480
So there is no point in staying here.

1431
01:37:55,880 --> 01:37:56,840
No, Aniket.

1432
01:37:58,600 --> 01:38:00,240
I know Sarita aunty is no more.

1433
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:03,600
But now, you're the
inheritor of India Lodge.

1434
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:07,280
And when you have inherited it,
you're responsible for it too.

1435
01:38:11,440 --> 01:38:12,920
These are India Lodge's papers.

1436
01:38:14,440 --> 01:38:16,520
All three of us have signed.

1437
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:19,360
Now, it has been transferred to your name.

1438
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:40,080
Take sir.. a cold water bottle.

1439
01:38:41,840 --> 01:38:44,640
Brother Aniket..
you came at the right moment.

1440
01:38:44,680 --> 01:38:46,720
Otherwise, all our hard work
for India Lodge would be waste..

1441
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:50,080
..we would have been left with nothing.

1442
01:38:50,600 --> 01:38:53,560
I still don't know who shot mom.

1443
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:54,880
And why.

1444
01:38:54,920 --> 01:38:58,240
Brother.. we have thousand such questions!

1445
01:38:58,320 --> 01:38:59,920
But the police don't have any answers.

1446
01:39:00,120 --> 01:39:01,880
The damn fellows just keep
us waiting there for hours..

1447
01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:03,800
..and don't tell us anything.
And they charge money too.

1448
01:39:05,200 --> 01:39:06,120
Hello.

1449
01:39:06,200 --> 01:39:10,640
If you want to know who shot
sister Sarita, come to the wood factory.

1450
01:39:14,040 --> 01:39:15,680
Any problem? Is there?

1451
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:16,920
Where is the wood factory?

1452
01:39:17,080 --> 01:39:19,080
Wood factory..
take this water and come quickly.

1453
01:39:19,160 --> 01:39:20,600
I'll show you the wood.

1454
01:39:24,440 --> 01:39:26,400
Come.. come here.
- This is it?

1455
01:39:26,480 --> 01:39:29,840
Yes come.. this is the factory.

1456
01:39:33,120 --> 01:39:35,480
The place seems to be familiar. But..

1457
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:39,200
I am not hundred percent sure.

1458
01:39:49,240 --> 01:39:56,200
"My dear beloved.."

1459
01:39:56,480 --> 01:40:02,920
"you're welcome to VP's den."

1460
01:40:03,400 --> 01:40:04,240
Welcome.

1461
01:40:05,040 --> 01:40:08,480
I knew it. I knew it..

1462
01:40:10,680 --> 01:40:13,880
Your deal is with me, VP. Let him go.

1463
01:40:14,920 --> 01:40:17,920
Aniket, you go.

1464
01:40:18,320 --> 01:40:20,440
"Aniket go.. go.. go.."

1465
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:21,880
"Aniket go.. go.. go.."

1466
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:23,240
Go, go.. Go away!

1467
01:40:23,280 --> 01:40:26,240
Hey! Stop this nonsense!

1468
01:40:28,160 --> 01:40:29,720
Your animosity is with me, isn't it?

1469
01:40:30,400 --> 01:40:31,280
Let him go.

1470
01:40:32,920 --> 01:40:34,120
I will let him go.

1471
01:40:34,440 --> 01:40:37,240
But somebody first ask him the question.

1472
01:40:37,640 --> 01:40:39,400
But why did you order coffee for me?

1473
01:40:39,480 --> 01:40:41,280
Not that one Chikki.

1474
01:40:41,720 --> 01:40:43,240
Ask him the question meant to be asked.

1475
01:40:43,320 --> 01:40:44,240
Oh.

1476
01:40:44,480 --> 01:40:46,640
Who shot sister Sarita?

1477
01:40:46,840 --> 01:40:52,720
Yes. And Aniket.. you surely
must want to know who shot your mother.

1478
01:40:53,080 --> 01:40:54,760
Of course, I want to know.

1479
01:40:58,600 --> 01:41:00,680
But you already know!

1480
01:41:31,920 --> 01:41:35,320
Even my face used to become
this way during Sanskrit paper.

1481
01:41:37,320 --> 01:41:38,440
Yes!

1482
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:40,680
Tell me Jay.. what?

1483
01:41:43,240 --> 01:41:46,440
You?!
- Yes, me..

1484
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:48,160
And why not.

1485
01:41:48,920 --> 01:41:50,600
I had a debt of crores of rupees.

1486
01:41:51,320 --> 01:41:53,400
And if I hadn't paid,
my green card would have been cancelled..

1487
01:41:54,440 --> 01:41:55,560
..or my life.

1488
01:41:56,600 --> 01:42:00,160
I told mom so many times
that we should sell India Lodge.

1489
01:42:00,520 --> 01:42:02,680
And go to US. And live there peacefully.

1490
01:42:02,760 --> 01:42:04,040
I needed the money.

1491
01:42:04,280 --> 01:42:05,120
But no.

1492
01:42:05,800 --> 01:42:07,880
She wouldn't let me sell India Lodge.

1493
01:42:09,440 --> 01:42:12,880
This India Lodge was more important
for her than her son's life.

1494
01:42:13,400 --> 01:42:17,560
For the sake of money,
you killed your own mother?!

1495
01:42:17,640 --> 01:42:19,320
I didn't have any other option.

1496
01:42:20,200 --> 01:42:23,600
And fortunately Henry called
me for help and I was here at that time.

1497
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:28,920
'You have to come to India.
I want to talk to you about India Lodge.'

1498
01:42:29,800 --> 01:42:31,480
'Anyway mom, I am coming to India.'

1499
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:34,080
'After I go,
all this will belong to you only.'

1500
01:42:34,600 --> 01:42:36,280
'This is our culture.'

1501
01:42:36,360 --> 01:42:37,280
'You're right mom.'

1502
01:42:37,360 --> 01:42:38,640
'It's our legacy.'

1503
01:42:38,720 --> 01:42:39,600
'Right.'

1504
01:42:39,680 --> 01:42:41,480
'This is our heritage.'

1505
01:42:41,760 --> 01:42:42,920
'Have you signed?'

1506
01:42:43,280 --> 01:42:48,000
'Yes. Take.
- Thank you.'

1507
01:42:48,240 --> 01:42:51,840
'That was a great deal. Oh my God.
Now it's time to celebrate, alright.'

1508
01:42:51,920 --> 01:42:53,400
'Yeah.
- We've done hard work.'

1509
01:42:54,920 --> 01:42:55,800
'Deal!'

1510
01:42:55,880 --> 01:42:59,560
'Mr. Aniket..
as promised, here is your share.'

1511
01:43:02,080 --> 01:43:03,920
'Hello Janvi, Aniket here.'

1512
01:43:04,840 --> 01:43:06,200
'What time are you running but..'

1513
01:43:06,560 --> 01:43:10,840
Legacy, heritage..
the world doesn't run with these big talks

1514
01:43:10,920 --> 01:43:12,440
It runs with money.

1515
01:43:13,120 --> 01:43:17,360
Well.. I did whatever I needed to do.

1516
01:43:18,440 --> 01:43:20,520
And I don't regret for that.

1517
01:43:22,440 --> 01:43:24,560
And you all are also so decent.

1518
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:28,160
You transferred India
Lodge to Aniket yourself.

1519
01:43:29,600 --> 01:43:32,920
Now.. in a short time,
a bull dozer will run over India Lodge.

1520
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:34,560
And you all won't be able to see it.

1521
01:43:34,640 --> 01:43:36,920
But you don't worry.
Because by that time, you..

1522
01:43:42,280 --> 01:43:45,160
Jay.. Jay..

1523
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:47,800
Hey.. Chika..
- Yes brother.

1524
01:43:49,720 --> 01:43:53,480
End this movie.
- Ok.

1525
01:43:54,280 --> 01:43:56,400
And now no movie is left, ok my friend.

1526
01:43:56,640 --> 01:43:58,720
Yes. Take a selfie now.

1527
01:43:59,200 --> 01:44:01,720
VP feeling happy.

1528
01:44:01,920 --> 01:44:03,120
Cheese.

1529
01:44:03,200 --> 01:44:05,520
Show your teeth. Say cheese!

1530
01:44:09,160 --> 01:44:10,440
Sorry Jay.

1531
01:44:10,760 --> 01:44:13,840
Thank you. I have got my money.

1532
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:17,680
Tonight, I am flying
back and then life is set.

1533
01:44:20,680 --> 01:44:23,920
India Lodge is going to be bull
dozed and I don't want to miss the treat.

1534
01:44:26,800 --> 01:44:29,320
VP, great job.

1535
01:44:33,360 --> 01:44:38,000
I will make the first blow on India Lodge.

1536
01:44:38,520 --> 01:44:39,680
Good luck.

1537
01:44:41,200 --> 01:44:43,280
I'll have to immediately
go and inform Yogesh, Janvi,..

1538
01:44:43,360 --> 01:44:45,600
.. Kishor uncle, Desai uncle and others.

1539
01:44:45,720 --> 01:44:48,760
Jay has been trapped with VP.

1540
01:44:48,880 --> 01:44:50,800
And Aniket is coming
to breakdown India Lodge.

1541
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,360
I am very worried about Jay.

1542
01:44:53,840 --> 01:44:57,000
Reema, its VP who will have to worry.

1543
01:44:57,080 --> 01:44:59,160
Don't worry, we'll take care of this.

1544
01:44:59,320 --> 01:45:00,880
Come on.
- Come on.

1545
01:45:04,760 --> 01:45:05,800
Welcome him.

1546
01:45:40,840 --> 01:45:42,840
Finish him off today, brother.

1547
01:45:44,680 --> 01:45:46,400
He is behaving too smart.

1548
01:45:47,040 --> 01:45:48,480
Take him there..

1549
01:45:50,800 --> 01:45:51,800
Switch on the machine.

1550
01:45:52,680 --> 01:45:54,320
Come on!

1551
01:45:55,400 --> 01:45:59,080
Tie him up.. make him lie down on this.

1552
01:46:27,760 --> 01:46:31,360
Tighter.. hold his legs.

1553
01:46:49,200 --> 01:46:50,920
I have come to break India Lodge.

1554
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:53,360
Forget India Lodge, Aniket..

1555
01:46:53,840 --> 01:46:55,880
..you won't be able to
break even a single brick here.

1556
01:46:59,480 --> 01:47:02,560
I'll make the first blow.

1557
01:47:16,240 --> 01:47:17,600
The account is still pending.

1558
01:47:19,720 --> 01:47:21,400
Let's have a final round.

1559
01:51:50,200 --> 01:51:54,920
If you have the strength..
post it on your FB account..

1560
01:51:56,080 --> 01:51:59,360
VP feeling dreadful!

1561
01:54:06,360 --> 01:54:07,320
Wait!

1562
01:54:13,120 --> 01:54:15,320
Eye for an eye.. no!

1563
01:54:15,920 --> 01:54:17,000
Let go.

1564
01:54:28,360 --> 01:54:30,480
Are you ok?
- Fine.

1565
01:54:36,360 --> 01:54:43,280
Son.. we couldn't help
you in times of real need.

1566
01:54:43,800 --> 01:54:45,400
Yes. Please forgive us.

1567
01:54:45,480 --> 01:54:46,760
Forgive us.

1568
01:54:47,360 --> 01:54:51,680
Desai uncle.. all of us
are the foundation of India Lodge.

1569
01:54:51,840 --> 01:54:54,240
And uncle,
because we are together, we are strong.

1570
01:54:54,320 --> 01:54:55,560
And this is our home.

1571
01:54:56,360 --> 01:54:57,400
True.

1572
01:54:57,680 --> 01:55:00,040
And those who come lovingly,
the doors will always be..

1573
01:55:00,200 --> 01:55:02,000
Open!!!

1574
01:55:02,120 --> 01:55:03,640
And if anyone tries to mess with us..

1575
01:55:04,880 --> 01:55:06,600
..we will open the doors
of the floor above for them.

1576
01:55:08,040 --> 01:55:11,120
Come on!
- Glory to India Lodge!

1577
01:55:11,200 --> 01:55:13,360
Glory to India Lodge!

1578
01:55:13,440 --> 01:55:15,760
Glory to India Lodge!

1579
01:55:15,840 --> 01:55:17,800
Glory to India Lodge!

1580
01:55:37,800 --> 01:55:41,160
India Lodge, once again
was filled with the same people..

1581
01:55:41,200 --> 01:55:44,920
..same birds.. and again
the same trouble with the newspaper.

1582
01:55:45,040 --> 01:55:46,200
Take this!

1583
01:55:46,320 --> 01:55:49,160
Damn you.. the newspaper
should be delivered at 5 o'clock!

1584
01:55:49,400 --> 01:55:50,600
Not at 6!

1585
01:55:50,920 --> 01:55:53,720
You.. you won't get paid today!

1586
01:56:05,480 --> 01:56:07,400
Sister, please give soap.

1587
01:56:08,440 --> 01:56:12,240
Take this. Special for you.
- Really.

1588
01:56:12,320 --> 01:56:13,480
Bath with it, ok.

1589
01:56:13,560 --> 01:56:15,280
And see this. The same soap saga.

1590
01:56:16,080 --> 01:56:17,880
Do it fast.. come on..

1591
01:56:19,720 --> 01:56:21,320
No, I removed those.

1592
01:56:21,800 --> 01:56:24,280
I knew something was fishy.

1593
01:56:24,800 --> 01:56:27,160
When this man became an Englishman
after going to America..

1594
01:56:27,480 --> 01:56:29,280
..how could I trust him?

1595
01:56:31,080 --> 01:56:33,800
Water it nicely. Let me wash my hands.

1596
01:56:33,920 --> 01:56:36,480
Our Sarita mother still is in India Lodge.

1597
01:56:36,760 --> 01:56:39,360
Can we get a room?
- Of course! Room is available.

1598
01:56:39,440 --> 01:56:40,320
Come on.

1599
01:56:40,400 --> 01:56:42,760
But you'll have to water the plants.
It's a rule here.

1600
01:56:42,840 --> 01:56:45,280
If you do as you're
told you'll enjoy here.

1601
01:56:45,360 --> 01:56:49,360
Once again, so many homeless
people like us will have a home.

1602
01:56:50,200 --> 01:56:51,280
This India Lodge.

1603
01:56:52,360 --> 01:56:56,320
For the first time I feel
as if there is no trouble.
