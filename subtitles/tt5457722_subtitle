1
00:04:09,566 --> 00:04:11,306
Why do we celebrate?

2
00:04:12,233 --> 00:04:15,525
Why do we wish to be a part of them?

3
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:19,361
Thereís beauty and joy when people meet...

4
00:04:20,108 --> 00:04:27,629
Imagine how good it would be when everyone
meets for every occasion to celebrate.

5
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:29,957
I am here to meet such people now.

6
00:04:30,733 --> 00:04:32,499
I found someone just like me.

7
00:04:33,441 --> 00:04:35,436
He has no inhibitions.

8
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:36,763
He talks to everyone...

9
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:39,949
He says, he doesnít think much.

10
00:04:40,608 --> 00:04:43,656
That was the first time...
I started thinking about myself.

11
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:49,008
One must be lucky to witness
God from really close in these grand celebrations.

12
00:04:49,608 --> 00:04:52,165
Heís doing just the same. Heís holding it...

13
00:06:12,816 --> 00:06:15,152
Brother, why donít you add some salt
and check for a change?

14
00:06:15,253 --> 00:06:16,477
Who is Mrs. Lakshmi?

15
00:06:17,316 --> 00:06:17,645
Oh...

16
00:06:18,525 --> 00:06:21,608
I asked you to be like one of us
and not a servant. Got that?

17
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:22,599
Sir, is Mrs. Lakshmi here?

18
00:06:23,733 --> 00:06:25,856
There are many Lakshmis here.
Who are you looking for?

19
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:29,412
My wifeís name is Susheela Lakshmi.
She doesnít talk too much...

20
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:33,822
My third brother is very bossy...
my sister-in-lawís name is Varalakshmi...

21
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:35,094
Not too bossy.

22
00:06:37,066 --> 00:06:39,996
My second brother and
his wife is Bhoo Lakshmi...

23
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:41,325
Sheís very patient.

24
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:46,251
I have an elder brother.
Heís not around.

25
00:06:46,775 --> 00:06:50,137
His wifeís name is Rajyalakshmi...
sheís epitome of peace.

26
00:06:50,237 --> 00:06:53,039
What about me?
- For you too.

27
00:06:53,858 --> 00:06:55,104
Chitti, for you!

28
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,524
I have a sister too. Sheís Mahalakshmi.

29
00:07:04,733 --> 00:07:06,638
So, there are so many Lakshmiís around.
You can go look for yours.

30
00:07:06,738 --> 00:07:07,133
From where?

31
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:08,221
From Benz circle!

32
00:07:08,397 --> 00:07:10,275
Not you, the gifts.
where are they from?

33
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,049
from London...

34
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:15,194
Must be our neice...
she sends gifts home for every occasion.

35
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:19,707
I donít need your autobiography. If you can help me
spot Mrs. Lakshmi, Iíll give it to her.

36
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,134
Look... Go straight in...

37
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,837
The one you feel like offering salutations
to is Mrs. Lakshmi.

38
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:26,461
Where is Chanti?

39
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:45,622
Chanti you are here,
I've been searching for you downstairs.

40
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:51,916
Hey, címon. Itís time!
- Hey, let me say it first.

41
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:57,833
One day, our city must be coloured
with the paints from our factory...

42
00:07:58,125 --> 00:07:59,169
One day this city should be
filled with our factory paints...

43
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:03,409
Not just these walls but their hearts too.
Their lives must be painted with our colours.

44
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,956
Itís not a big deal if you really believe in it.

45
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:08,288
Come and bless my daughter first.
-Let's go.

46
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:11,683
Madam... who is Mrs. Lakshmi?
-No idea.

47
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:15,927
Are you Mrs. Lakshmi?
- It's not me.

48
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:24,500
Excuse me... I beg you... I believe thereís
someone here one offers salutations to, who is she?

49
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:25,708
I am right here.

50
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:26,973
You didnít go?

51
00:08:27,148 --> 00:08:29,104
No. You arenít helping me.
Iíll almost cry now.

52
00:08:29,304 --> 00:08:33,053
Hey... whatever comes here,
it must reach the hands of the right people.

53
00:08:33,253 --> 00:08:35,140
I have been worrying about this.

54
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:40,008
What are you up to? people here have been
fight about this since forever..

55
00:08:48,183 --> 00:08:51,735
Hey! Stop your nonsense...

56
00:08:52,249 --> 00:08:55,666
What do you even know?

57
00:08:55,875 --> 00:09:01,465
If we note 36 characteristics about you
all would be negative. You know that and so do I.

58
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,862
And you are looking for your identity now.

59
00:09:04,241 --> 00:09:05,991
Even though sheís not your daughter...

60
00:09:06,033 --> 00:09:09,625
Canít you be happy for
your friendís daughterís wedding?

61
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:10,252
Son!

62
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:14,261
Brother-in-law... I was talking to them...

63
00:09:14,691 --> 00:09:15,658
Let me say first.

64
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:18,554
Sangeet is in the evening.
You must look into everything.

65
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:23,291
Iíll tell you if thereís anything.
-Come and bless her first.

66
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:25,381
Where is he?

67
00:09:42,983 --> 00:09:47,660
"Your Lips are Sweet and Charming,
Your Face is Sweet and Charming.."

68
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:53,334
"Your Eyes are Sweet and Charming and
Your Laughter is Sweet and Charming.."

69
00:09:54,025 --> 00:09:58,882
"Your Heart is Sweet and Charming
Your Going is Sweet and Charming.."

70
00:09:59,566 --> 00:10:04,289
"Everything about You is Sweet and Charming,
oh sweetness.."

71
00:10:05,025 --> 00:10:09,805
"Sweetness... Sweetness..."

72
00:10:16,066 --> 00:10:20,838
"Your Speech is Sweet and Charming,
Your Nature is Sweet and Charming.."

73
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:26,464
"Your Eyes are Sweet and Charming and
Your Laughter is Sweet and Charming.."

74
00:10:29,858 --> 00:10:34,705
"Your Heart is Sweet and Charming
Your Going is Sweet and Charming.."

75
00:10:35,358 --> 00:10:40,174
"Everything about You is Sweet and Charming,
oh sweetness.."

76
00:10:40,608 --> 00:10:46,165
"Your Bent Posture is Sweet
and Charming.."

77
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:51,514
"Your Walking is Sweet and Charming.."

78
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:17,703
Enough of your stiffness.
Ready? -Let's go.

79
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:23,017
Brother, why are you eating Mr. Manthena
Satyanarayana Rajuís food. Canít you push it off?

80
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:26,208
Push push push.. heís done!

81
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:28,291
Címon.. uncle... címon.

82
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:31,333
Careful!
-C'mon push me.

83
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:33,408
Uncle is done.

84
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:37,875
Uncle is gone.

85
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:41,250
How did you fall? -Superb!

86
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,449
Hey, letís talk good things.

87
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:44,679
Nothing else...

88
00:11:46,866 --> 00:11:47,649
Just good vibes!

89
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:49,143
Uncle...

90
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,957
Uncle here... Mother...

91
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:53,971
What is this?

92
00:11:57,966 --> 00:11:59,413
Valli... this one is for you...

93
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:05,847
Husband thinks about one hundred things
but we think just about them...

94
00:12:08,425 --> 00:12:11,680
Just think about that... donít worry much.

95
00:12:20,175 --> 00:12:21,915
Get up sister... Get up!

96
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:34,844
Sister-in-law, brother is not here.
Heís never around laughter.

97
00:12:41,616 --> 00:12:46,106
A girl must go through this no matter what...

98
00:12:46,608 --> 00:12:48,625
She wonít budge with her parents
and wonít argue with in-laws.

99
00:12:49,316 --> 00:12:54,299
All these are lessons, girl...
it all depends on his. Thatís it.

100
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:55,507
Good one sister.

101
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:01,805
A good word gives immense satisfaction.

102
00:13:03,425 --> 00:13:04,546
Makes you content...

103
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,771
and with so much love...

104
00:13:07,966 --> 00:13:10,276
And heís a combination of all that.

105
00:13:17,633 --> 00:13:21,689
We gave her the name Anandavalli
when she was born.

106
00:13:22,508 --> 00:13:24,800
Our lives changed ever since...

107
00:13:29,216 --> 00:13:32,478
Heís our strength for life. Itís him...

108
00:13:34,925 --> 00:13:35,348
Come...

109
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:43,629
If things happen as per our will or not.
wishes fulfil or not.

110
00:13:44,525 --> 00:13:48,497
We need people around us
to deal with everything.

111
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:57,396
One good thought...

112
00:13:58,541 --> 00:13:59,289
Celebration!

113
00:14:00,758 --> 00:14:01,447
Happiness

114
00:14:04,108 --> 00:14:06,434
"The moment is here.."

115
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:10,911
"Let's say something nice..."

116
00:14:11,858 --> 00:14:14,021
"What are we waiting for..."

117
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,568
"Let's invite everyone..."

118
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:40,459
"What's music without Sa Pa Sa..."

119
00:14:41,775 --> 00:14:43,901
"A joyful jump in joy..."

120
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,876
"Is not really a mistake..."

121
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,556
"Attention everybody..."

122
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:55,223
"Say yay for fun..."

123
00:14:56,858 --> 00:14:58,893
"Enough of ABCD.."

124
00:15:00,508 --> 00:15:02,764
"Because, anybody can dance.."

125
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:16,293
"Live for the moment...
gotta live for the moment..."

126
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:20,377
"Live... Live... Live..."

127
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:27,089
"What's music without Sa Pa Sa..."

128
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:30,718
"A joyful jump in joy..."

129
00:15:32,525 --> 00:15:34,557
"Is not really a mistake..."

130
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:58,306
"Happiness is hidden within us..."

131
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:05,790
"Light it up with your smile...
Only then will you know..."

132
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:14,004
"Say hello playfully...
Don't look here and there..."

133
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:21,583
"Just say yes..
don't look for excuses..."

134
00:16:23,966 --> 00:16:26,150
"Any moment..."

135
00:16:27,816 --> 00:16:30,082
"Any place..."

136
00:16:31,566 --> 00:16:37,430
"If you want to be happy..
You must believe so..."

137
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:12,448
"Do you hold responsible for this planet?"

138
00:17:13,691 --> 00:17:19,988
"Do you have all the worries of the world?"

139
00:17:21,233 --> 00:17:28,168
"Why is everyone alone by themselves.."

140
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:36,156
"Why are you all like a wallflower...
Don't be silent..."

141
00:17:38,108 --> 00:17:44,127
"If you really want something...
If something else happens.."

142
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:51,608
"If you don't budge...
No issue can harm you..."

143
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:59,026
"Attention everybody...
Say yay for fun..."

144
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:06,601
"Enough of ABCD
Because, anybody can dance!"

145
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:17,572
So, did you see him?
loves his job!

146
00:18:17,672 --> 00:18:19,934
What! Itís all show off.

147
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:24,485
Canít you see us or what?
Why are you so hesitant?

148
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,944
Or are you a show off just like him?

149
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:33,530
Why are you looking at us like that?
Did I say something wrong? I spoke the truth...

150
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:35,114
You and your inhibitions.

151
00:18:35,608 --> 00:18:38,246
If it was not for your brother-in-law,
you wouldnít have had a home.

152
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:40,880
Youíd have been looking
for juice just like us.

153
00:18:44,191 --> 00:18:48,264
Whatís wrong with that?
You said it with affection...

154
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:56,458
If my father hadnít made an effort to give those
four hundred rupees to my brother-in-law...

155
00:18:57,783 --> 00:18:58,914
Things would have been different, right?

156
00:19:03,883 --> 00:19:05,709
He felt bad.
- Gulp it.

157
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:11,888
Did you call me, uncle?
Your parents might like it... not me...

158
00:19:12,275 --> 00:19:14,319
Morning he will ask me
for all the calculations.

159
00:19:14,733 --> 00:19:16,889
Come, drop me home.
My head is thumping. Iíll get some sleep.

160
00:19:17,108 --> 00:19:18,386
Come on.
- Not that way.

161
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:20,878
Okay, come.

162
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:31,255
(Humming)

163
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:35,812
Why is your face like that?
Look how happy he is...

164
00:19:36,013 --> 00:19:40,141
Have you ever been so happy in 50 years?

165
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:43,760
Why did you stop here?
- Lemon soda is amazing here...

166
00:19:44,124 --> 00:19:45,928
Hey, give me two glasses.
- Ok.

167
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:51,302
Every family must have a son like you...
Your father is lucky. Very lucky!

168
00:19:51,574 --> 00:20:00,387
There are Gods who grant wishes.
And you wont be able to take it then. Fool!

169
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:04,062
Itís very easy to convince you, uncle. Take it.

170
00:20:04,374 --> 00:20:07,446
Why would you say that?
I didnít think much. Just said what I felt.

171
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:23,210
Tell me.. what happened?

172
00:20:23,749 --> 00:20:28,121
Why are you bothered?
Just to kill time, you keep asking anything...

173
00:20:29,749 --> 00:20:30,478
Thereís nothing...

174
00:20:31,624 --> 00:20:35,852
Iím moving things... is anyone even noticing?
What if things go wrong?

175
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:41,638
You just want to dress up and go out.
while we were leading our lives.

176
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:46,364
He got us here.
He did it all... gave us everything...

177
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:50,518
We can stay back, right? You will question me...

178
00:20:52,358 --> 00:20:57,870
And somehow it annoys me
when things make him happy.

179
00:20:58,749 --> 00:20:59,974
What makes you say so?

180
00:21:00,174 --> 00:21:02,887
Itís a lot that i said it...
and now you are asking why?

181
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:07,155
Stop it, you. Youíll get mad if I say anything.

182
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:10,322
Where would I get medicine for this?

183
00:21:15,124 --> 00:21:18,338
I found it, Look there..

184
00:21:21,499 --> 00:21:25,734
Where is Lord Hanuman in the picture?
Near Lord Ramaís feet...

185
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:29,118
Does that mean we must not worship him?

186
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:32,516
Stop building temples for him?
People consider him as God, right?

187
00:21:35,249 --> 00:21:39,543
Look, you are like Hanuman and heís Lord Rama.

188
00:21:42,874 --> 00:21:44,838
You donít get it?

189
00:21:45,874 --> 00:21:49,041
Letís do one thing...
Letís get our daughter married to their son...

190
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:54,085
Then everythingís ours... our girls.

191
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:57,090
At least then youíll feel fine...
and let go off your thoughts...

192
00:21:57,634 --> 00:21:59,379
Is that fine with you?

193
00:22:12,249 --> 00:22:12,665
Hi..

194
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:14,424
Father!

195
00:22:16,458 --> 00:22:20,205
You're not bothered about your Father..
heíll come here and wait...

196
00:22:21,583 --> 00:22:23,427
I was contemplating about coming.

197
00:22:24,124 --> 00:22:26,516
Now that I am here I wonder
why I took this decision.

198
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:29,111
After seeing you, I wonder if
itís okay that I am here...

199
00:22:29,541 --> 00:22:32,754
I would have... I should have thought
about myself...

200
00:22:33,458 --> 00:22:34,848
Thatís how I am thinking...

201
00:22:35,416 --> 00:22:39,476
Youíre Kashi Annapurana for namesake.
You just donít have stability.

202
00:22:39,576 --> 00:22:41,798
Father, start...

203
00:22:42,958 --> 00:22:44,024
The guy is 6 feet tall...

204
00:22:44,541 --> 00:22:46,888
Stays home after 6 oíclock...
he belongs to our caste...

205
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:48,502
You say things like that, right?

206
00:22:49,583 --> 00:22:51,474
Say it... itís been long that I heard.

207
00:22:52,333 --> 00:22:55,118
You started even before
I strated talking about your wedding.

208
00:22:55,227 --> 00:22:56,020
Itís time for change, father...

209
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:58,096
Weddings, relationships..

210
00:22:58,312 --> 00:23:01,453
Thereís so much more to study, so much to see.
- Ok.

211
00:23:43,333 --> 00:23:47,999
Brother, shall I load this distemper paint
along with them? -Go ahead...

212
00:23:48,208 --> 00:23:50,791
Take it quickly... whatís the delay for?

213
00:23:50,833 --> 00:23:52,020
Batch is ready sir...

214
00:23:52,374 --> 00:23:53,416
Check the stock completely...

215
00:23:53,624 --> 00:23:56,187
Should we dispatch?
Yes, we have to dispatch immediately...

216
00:23:56,833 --> 00:23:58,919
Hey! Ha ha ha...

217
00:24:01,916 --> 00:24:02,512
Greetings, uncle.

218
00:24:02,999 --> 00:24:05,208
Oh... ha ha ha.

219
00:24:06,083 --> 00:24:07,168
When did you come from Australia?

220
00:24:08,041 --> 00:24:10,582
Ask her when sheís leaving.. hahaha

221
00:24:10,666 --> 00:24:13,166
Youíre a photocopy of your father...

222
00:24:13,208 --> 00:24:15,379
He never takes anything...
heís content with what he has.

223
00:24:16,583 --> 00:24:18,666
Sheíll stay here as long as sheís here.

224
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:21,715
You don't need to mention that...
- Okay, heís very busy... letís go!

225
00:24:21,915 --> 00:24:22,332
Just a minute... one minute!

226
00:24:22,416 --> 00:24:23,732
What?
-Let me say it first...

227
00:24:26,124 --> 00:24:27,745
Take it, girl..
-Uncle...

228
00:24:29,416 --> 00:24:31,973
Don't spend it... just keep it with you forever...

229
00:24:34,333 --> 00:24:34,787
Thank you..

230
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:38,733
I wonít take it... hahaha

231
00:24:40,833 --> 00:24:44,269
This curry is amazing. Have some more.
- I had it and passed it to you.

232
00:24:46,083 --> 00:24:47,658
Enough..
Have it...

233
00:24:50,374 --> 00:24:51,082
Wonít you eat?

234
00:24:52,932 --> 00:24:53,929
I will have it at Auntís home.

235
00:24:55,083 --> 00:24:57,580
You very know how to eat
at any random place.

236
00:24:59,291 --> 00:25:01,099
Aunt, Iím hungry..
Can you please serve some food..

237
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:02,447
Did you eat there?

238
00:25:02,708 --> 00:25:05,164
Didnít think so much, aunt..
I just felt like eating, so came here...

239
00:25:05,458 --> 00:25:05,899
What did you make?

240
00:25:06,374 --> 00:25:07,710
Fish curry and lamb curry..

241
00:25:07,886 --> 00:25:09,564
I  want lamb curry..

242
00:25:09,958 --> 00:25:11,866
By the way.. everyoneís on the terrace..
they are making pickles.

243
00:25:13,333 --> 00:25:15,946
Ha ha ha....

244
00:25:18,166 --> 00:25:21,804
A guy who can excite me has not been born...
Open statement!

245
00:25:23,291 --> 00:25:25,309
You know where it all started...

246
00:25:25,749 --> 00:25:27,916
On the 10th class mark sheet
they mention about birthmarks, right?

247
00:25:28,499 --> 00:25:31,359
A mole on the shoulder, a mole on the cheek,
a mole on the chin..

248
00:25:32,249 --> 00:25:33,257
My uncle that way...

249
00:25:33,708 --> 00:25:38,042
Didnít realise that iíll grow up someday...

250
00:25:38,791 --> 00:25:43,966
And wrote a mole on the waist
on my sheet, crazy fool...

251
00:25:44,374 --> 00:25:45,546
When I go to interviews...

252
00:25:46,333 --> 00:25:52,521
and they accidently read that,
I get looked at very weirdly.

253
00:25:53,374 --> 00:25:56,645
Stop looking at me, guys...
When will you guys change?

254
00:25:57,499 --> 00:26:01,052
Well, is the mole still there?
- Why donít you show it?

255
00:26:16,249 --> 00:26:21,848
"At Naidu's house..Near the pea tree.
What did Naidu say, girl?.."

256
00:26:22,291 --> 00:26:25,086
"You're so weird, girl?"

257
00:26:28,999 --> 00:26:34,680
"At Naidu's house... Near the pea tree...
Naidu gave me four hens.."

258
00:26:35,124 --> 00:26:37,990
"And my heart started thumping, aunt!"

259
00:26:42,083 --> 00:26:43,134
Go... I'll eat and come.

260
00:26:45,374 --> 00:26:47,206
I'll come behind you
after finishing my food.

261
00:26:49,041 --> 00:26:54,618
"At Karanam's house.. Near the drumstick
tree.What did the cupid say, girl?"

262
00:26:55,041 --> 00:26:57,850
"What did the cupid say?"

263
00:26:58,624 --> 00:27:04,267
"At Karanam's house, Near the drumstick tree.
He said, he'd give a gold necklace..."

264
00:27:04,666 --> 00:27:07,589
"A gold necklace..."

265
00:27:08,266 --> 00:27:13,807
"At Munasabu's house... At the door...
What did he say?"

266
00:27:14,249 --> 00:27:17,117
"What did he say?"

267
00:27:17,749 --> 00:27:23,420
"At Munasabu's house... At the door...
He said, he'd give me nose pins!"

268
00:27:24,124 --> 00:27:26,723
"He said, he'd give me nose pins!"

269
00:27:39,249 --> 00:27:40,829
"On your fancy chignon..."

270
00:27:42,458 --> 00:27:44,135
"Three Chrysanthemum flowers.."

271
00:27:45,583 --> 00:27:51,075
"Who put them there, girl?
You look so beautiful, girl..."

272
00:27:51,999 --> 00:27:57,588
"With chrysanthemum flowers in hand...
Naidu called me slyly..."

273
00:27:58,041 --> 00:28:00,859
"My heart was beating hard, aunt!"

274
00:28:01,624 --> 00:28:04,874
"When I wore the gold necklace
and walked by the stream..."

275
00:28:04,916 --> 00:28:10,361
"Naidu caught me there...
My heart was beating hard, aunt!"

276
00:28:11,124 --> 00:28:14,138
"My mother's brothers..
are my uncles..."

277
00:28:14,458 --> 00:28:20,790
"Ones with umbreallas... Ones with
fancy shoes..With beautiful eyes.."

278
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:24,041
"With elegant gait... Must be someone.."

279
00:28:24,133 --> 00:28:27,100
"Wait till sunrise.. have a
Place your cot carefully.."

280
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:30,983
"Turn the lights on in your patio..
Scream if he doesn't come.."

281
00:28:53,916 --> 00:28:56,629
Donít take that manís
goodness for granted,

282
00:28:56,806 --> 00:28:59,596
Why are you behaving like
it is your own factory?

283
00:29:00,833 --> 00:29:01,806
Who are we?

284
00:29:02,666 --> 00:29:05,541
Why are we here?
Iíll answer my question...

285
00:29:05,874 --> 00:29:09,931
Big companies buying small companies
is a thing of the past...

286
00:29:10,416 --> 00:29:14,259
But your company is not that small...
we enquired about it...

287
00:29:15,041 --> 00:29:18,458
Who said that itís being sold?
That is your question...

288
00:29:20,041 --> 00:29:22,859
Who doesnít like money?
That is my answer...

289
00:29:23,416 --> 00:29:26,917
One budges for money...
some budge on appreciation..

290
00:29:27,291 --> 00:29:28,904
Whatís this mess?

291
00:29:29,208 --> 00:29:33,016
Why am I telling all this to you? Is your question..

292
00:29:33,458 --> 00:29:37,912
All will be done if I say something
and he passes it on to him...

293
00:29:38,112 --> 00:29:40,536
Thatís my answer...

294
00:29:42,041 --> 00:29:46,241
But why should we sell?
Is your stern question...

295
00:29:46,666 --> 00:29:51,928
He understands complicated
things very easily...

296
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:57,808
You mean.. we must split the property
and fight for assets later...

297
00:29:58,666 --> 00:29:59,482
That would be your question...

298
00:30:00,708 --> 00:30:05,713
Will you get such an offer once again..
is my answer...

299
00:30:07,458 --> 00:30:07,894
Son!

300
00:30:25,874 --> 00:30:26,764
Mother..

301
00:30:28,874 --> 00:30:31,736
Auntís exhibition... uncleís hotel..

302
00:30:32,083 --> 00:30:35,174
uncleís temple...  wonder what he has done
to be punished so much..

303
00:30:49,708 --> 00:30:54,943
When I have some issues,
I look at them for ten minutes..

304
00:30:56,208 --> 00:30:59,494
Then my father tells me..
or my grand father tells me...

305
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:01,181
Or my great-grand father...

306
00:31:01,624 --> 00:31:05,605
I donít call it a day unless
one of them donít talk to me..

307
00:31:10,833 --> 00:31:11,755
How much will they give?

308
00:31:12,416 --> 00:31:13,845
About 400 cr...

309
00:31:14,999 --> 00:31:20,299
That day when he gave me 400 bucks,
I made it into 400 Cr today.

310
00:31:21,374 --> 00:31:22,386
Sounds amazing...

311
00:31:24,333 --> 00:31:27,179
Do they have the intelligence
of selling it for 400 Cr?

312
00:31:28,124 --> 00:31:28,781
Thatís it..

313
00:31:30,083 --> 00:31:31,904
I got the backup of those 400 bucks...

314
00:31:33,208 --> 00:31:34,869
and the that gives me courage...

315
00:31:35,624 --> 00:31:37,126
Will forge ahead with the mix of both...

316
00:31:39,083 --> 00:31:43,558
Life is all about trust..not business.

317
00:31:47,374 --> 00:31:50,090
Say something.. I want to listen to you..

318
00:32:02,541 --> 00:32:05,135
Is he silent because he knows everything
or because he donít?

319
00:32:32,916 --> 00:32:34,446
Take it..
- Oh, Thank you.

320
00:32:37,374 --> 00:32:40,557
Who made these arrangements? Father or son?

321
00:32:41,291 --> 00:32:42,977
How does that matter... look over there...

322
00:32:43,541 --> 00:32:45,290
Thereís no smile on that face even today.

323
00:33:33,041 --> 00:33:36,562
He is still dancing...
Stop him, he may fall down.

324
00:33:36,763 --> 00:33:39,055
Hey, stop it, you..

325
00:33:39,708 --> 00:33:43,211
Stop it, come here...
- Itís time for the wedding.

326
00:33:47,333 --> 00:33:49,030
You look better than the first time I saw you...

327
00:33:49,926 --> 00:33:50,926
Even I feel better now...

328
00:33:51,666 --> 00:33:53,001
I have a small confusion though...

329
00:33:54,041 --> 00:33:56,137
But I can deal with that for life, if you are ready!

330
00:33:56,791 --> 00:33:59,387
Weíll be together for 2 months, right? Letís see...

331
00:33:59,833 --> 00:34:00,484
Two months?

332
00:34:01,708 --> 00:34:02,489
Only Two months...

333
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:05,219
Can I use this space, brother-in-law?

334
00:34:06,416 --> 00:34:09,879
Oh.. Looks like something interesting
is happening on the stage...

335
00:34:10,623 --> 00:34:13,526
Have I come between the
two of you, brother-in-law?

336
00:34:13,726 --> 00:34:15,158
Or has she come between the two of us?

337
00:34:15,525 --> 00:34:18,256
Or have you come between us?
-I just told her something...

338
00:34:18,791 --> 00:34:19,565
I understood something else..

339
00:34:20,029 --> 00:34:21,688
you are thinking about something.
Letís go.

340
00:34:24,748 --> 00:34:25,386
Aren't you coming?

341
00:34:38,373 --> 00:34:41,910
Maíam, bride and the groom are ready..
start it already...

342
00:34:43,041 --> 00:34:44,033
What is it, sister-in-law?

343
00:34:44,481 --> 00:34:48,689
You were on the groomís side
and now you are on the brideís side.

344
00:34:49,248 --> 00:34:54,526
If you take the guyís side,
you think theyíll give you more dowry?

345
00:34:54,791 --> 00:35:00,940
Ah... You need at 600 people
to count the money my son earns.

346
00:35:02,708 --> 00:35:04,733
Okay.. keep your money with you...

347
00:35:04,912 --> 00:35:07,323
How the debts also be my responsibility?

348
00:35:07,833 --> 00:35:10,062
And his name spells money... Lord of seven hills!

349
00:35:11,583 --> 00:35:14,229
Well, no one can point out to our boy...

350
00:35:14,666 --> 00:35:16,847
You please talk about your girl..

351
00:35:17,124 --> 00:35:19,517
Excuse me... did you check everything?

352
00:35:19,874 --> 00:35:22,221
Did you find out about
our girl and our family?

353
00:35:22,458 --> 00:35:24,655
Or you have just come
without any preparation?

354
00:35:27,249 --> 00:35:30,433
Look at our girlís complexion
and look at his.

355
00:35:31,041 --> 00:35:33,605
Why is he so dark?

356
00:35:34,958 --> 00:35:37,911
Despite knowing his complexion,

357
00:35:38,247 --> 00:35:41,627
your daughter has been
going out with him for ages.

358
00:35:41,916 --> 00:35:47,493
I hope you know that... Or the next bus
is ready for departure... Will you leave?

359
00:35:49,458 --> 00:35:55,180
Yeah.. we had lot of sweets in the morning...
to talk about our girl...

360
00:35:55,416 --> 00:36:00,787
You guys will fall asleep
if I start talking about our girl...

361
00:36:06,499 --> 00:36:10,107
Heíll get married and push off
by the time we find out...

362
00:36:10,541 --> 00:36:16,332
And then youíll faint while going
to the lord of seven hills...

363
00:36:52,874 --> 00:36:57,738
"How did Bala Tripuramani move
her waist like that and walk by.."

364
00:36:58,208 --> 00:37:02,680
"How is it known that it seems
like spine and she like butter.."

365
00:37:03,458 --> 00:37:08,000
"She is kancheevaram silk and I have the
dhoti attire yet, fine gold thread matched.."

366
00:37:08,624 --> 00:37:13,656
"Gotta go there now or later right.."

367
00:37:13,858 --> 00:37:18,457
"Budha will fight a war after seeing you.."

368
00:37:19,124 --> 00:37:23,999
"So evident is your beauty.."

369
00:37:24,291 --> 00:37:28,906
"You asked me something outright
and secretly.."

370
00:37:29,541 --> 00:37:34,470
"Told you bluntly what attracted me.."

371
00:38:05,624 --> 00:38:10,084
"Shall I say there's no hesitation
at all now.."

372
00:38:10,916 --> 00:38:15,258
"Found out from you speech that
there's no distinction between you.."

373
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:18,215
"Does the age not know? Knows.."

374
00:38:18,458 --> 00:38:20,834
"Won't it ask you? fights.."

375
00:38:21,083 --> 00:38:26,462
"Stop after stammerring.. won't stop
Moreover after meeting candidly.."

376
00:38:26,662 --> 00:38:31,279
"Some hurriedness (that raises)
Shall I explain the meaning of that.."

377
00:38:31,833 --> 00:38:37,164
"Your immatchable and
I'm attracted to you like never before.."

378
00:39:18,791 --> 00:39:23,227
"Wanna hear every word
that hasn't crossed you.."

379
00:39:24,041 --> 00:39:28,378
"Wanna say it out that
which is thought by mistake.."

380
00:39:28,874 --> 00:39:33,984
"Leisure thats beyond count
Announcement thats incredible.."

381
00:39:34,208 --> 00:39:39,447
"Dunno why it wont stop me anymore
Shall I forge ahead with you effortlessly.."

382
00:39:39,547 --> 00:39:44,372
"Union that has crossed directions
Inappropriate if anyone bends.."

383
00:39:44,833 --> 00:39:50,016
"Rapport was identified after
seeing beauty like you.."

384
00:40:11,708 --> 00:40:13,003
I'll get it..
-I'll give you..

385
00:40:13,374 --> 00:40:15,787
Bujji, she needs something..
-Ice cream. Vanilla?

386
00:40:16,041 --> 00:40:17,828
Do you need anything?
-Thank you sir.

387
00:40:22,541 --> 00:40:23,580
Am I right?

388
00:40:24,249 --> 00:40:26,368
Letís go loafing around Vijaywada tonight?

389
00:40:28,041 --> 00:40:28,718
All night?

390
00:40:29,583 --> 00:40:31,794
What if I get excited?

391
00:40:33,541 --> 00:40:35,821
Shall I get someone along?
Or will you be able to manage?

392
00:40:51,124 --> 00:40:52,727
Come here..

393
00:40:53,015 --> 00:40:53,433
What is it?

394
00:40:54,524 --> 00:40:55,884
Can we do things in public?

395
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:00,848
Guys think like that... But nothing happens...

396
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:03,497
They only find out later...

397
00:41:17,833 --> 00:41:20,314
41, 42, 43...

398
00:41:21,624 --> 00:41:24,011
If you feel comfortable
you just might feel like my wife.

399
00:41:24,204 --> 00:41:24,671
What else?

400
00:41:26,333 --> 00:41:29,221
With you by my side
I am trying very hard to be sober...

401
00:41:29,708 --> 00:41:30,219
What more...

402
00:41:31,249 --> 00:41:33,767
Are you done?
You wanted to go everywhere.

403
00:41:34,708 --> 00:41:36,311
Are you tired already?

404
00:41:37,499 --> 00:41:39,258
Tradition? Silk saree?

405
00:41:39,818 --> 00:41:41,583
I didnít think too much.
I said because I like it.

406
00:41:44,666 --> 00:41:46,280
I said it, right..

407
00:41:47,249 --> 00:41:48,991
They count things that are irrelevant...

408
00:41:53,958 --> 00:41:56,103
They keep counting till the count is right...

409
00:42:00,791 --> 00:42:03,023
Boys are scared of walking along with girls...

410
00:42:03,916 --> 00:42:05,967
They just walk ahead...

411
00:42:06,541 --> 00:42:08,524
Boy donít leave if itís slightly massy...

412
00:42:11,791 --> 00:42:15,171
Girls have crossed that point long ago...
they take it quite casually...

413
00:42:19,458 --> 00:42:20,014
I told you, right?

414
00:42:20,791 --> 00:42:23,424
Guys just need a hug and a kiss... thatís it...

415
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:25,707
They can do anything for that...

416
00:42:25,916 --> 00:42:27,114
Okay, letís dance?

417
00:42:27,666 --> 00:42:29,401
There are no people...

418
00:42:30,374 --> 00:42:32,156
I donít like dancing like this..

419
00:42:32,708 --> 00:42:33,757
Sheís seen it all I guess!

420
00:42:40,565 --> 00:42:42,007
This is good, right?
-Yes, mother.

421
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:43,633
Look at this one..

422
00:42:46,683 --> 00:42:48,856
I like the colour..

423
00:42:49,516 --> 00:42:51,577
Show me..
-Canít you see..

424
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:55,487
Now?

425
00:42:57,641 --> 00:43:00,255
Mother, what is he eating? -Who?

426
00:43:01,350 --> 00:43:01,787
Nothing..

427
00:43:03,433 --> 00:43:04,280
You tell me...

428
00:43:04,891 --> 00:43:06,262
This will look good on aunt, right?

429
00:43:07,225 --> 00:43:08,397
Heís eating something..

430
00:43:10,558 --> 00:43:13,401
Leave that. Tell me if you like it...

431
00:43:14,433 --> 00:43:16,232
It is good, right?
-Custard apple...

432
00:43:17,950 --> 00:43:20,439
Not just that... lots of custard apple...

433
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:24,277
That's a lot... what about me?

434
00:43:24,683 --> 00:43:27,624
Hey, let me show you my sarees first...
-What about custard apple?

435
00:43:29,475 --> 00:43:31,153
Heís only been eating.

436
00:43:31,850 --> 00:43:35,163
I managed to send you out for further studies..

437
00:43:35,891 --> 00:43:37,262
But couldnít send him.

438
00:43:37,558 --> 00:43:40,683
How are your classmates?
The one who ate all the corn..

439
00:43:40,766 --> 00:43:44,475
The fat one, are they around? Are they?

440
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,177
You still remember them?

441
00:43:46,725 --> 00:43:50,449
Thatís 1st is Ramadevi, 2nd Umadevi, 3rd is Satyavati

442
00:43:50,649 --> 00:43:55,194
4th is Chandrani...5th Padmaja... 6th is Dhanalakshmi...
-Father...

443
00:43:55,394 --> 00:43:57,633
7th is Seshaveni..
-What?

444
00:43:57,933 --> 00:43:58,848
Why are you laughing?

445
00:44:08,183 --> 00:44:09,055
What is it, father?

446
00:44:10,475 --> 00:44:11,453
Everyoneís here except you..

447
00:44:13,641 --> 00:44:14,028
Come back!

448
00:44:14,850 --> 00:44:16,304
Convince your husband and come here...

449
00:44:18,641 --> 00:44:22,623
when dad wakes up at midnight...
or mother makes tea...

450
00:44:23,933 --> 00:44:28,975
They think of our shenanigans as kids,
hence they were craving to see you and talk to you...

451
00:44:29,391 --> 00:44:31,952
If we want to embrace you,
you are not around...

452
00:44:34,933 --> 00:44:37,473
And you are too far away...

453
00:44:38,350 --> 00:44:39,900
I can fill in for you...

454
00:44:41,725 --> 00:44:44,618
But... only a father can feel that...

455
00:44:45,308 --> 00:44:48,152
We will stay with Dad
and we will keep staying with him.

456
00:44:48,850 --> 00:44:50,927
Thatís amazing. come here.

457
00:44:56,475 --> 00:44:57,904
She is crying... -Ok..

458
00:44:58,105 --> 00:44:59,112
Hereís custard apple...

459
00:44:59,433 --> 00:45:01,270
Shall I send an entire basket to London?
Don't cry...

460
00:45:01,558 --> 00:45:03,836
Say something nice.. something!

461
00:45:04,308 --> 00:45:04,774
Father.

462
00:45:06,016 --> 00:45:06,359
Mother.

463
00:45:07,058 --> 00:45:07,557
Brother...

464
00:45:08,183 --> 00:45:08,476
Sister...

465
00:45:09,475 --> 00:45:10,114
All of us...

466
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:11,127
All of us...

467
00:45:11,933 --> 00:45:12,943
Everybody...

468
00:45:14,975 --> 00:45:17,482
Lots of everybody!
Ha ha ha...

469
00:45:23,075 --> 00:45:26,384
Relations are very good...
There is no end...

470
00:45:26,766 --> 00:45:30,471
They keep continuing..
But they are good...

471
00:45:37,808 --> 00:45:39,201
I really like Australia.

472
00:45:39,766 --> 00:45:41,873
You know why I want to settle there...

473
00:45:42,558 --> 00:45:45,454
You can scream out loud if youíre angry...

474
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:48,834
You can run if youíre  bored of walking...

475
00:45:49,350 --> 00:45:54,330
Even if our people are not around
you try to be nice to everyone..

476
00:45:54,850 --> 00:45:56,130
You can offer salutations!

477
00:45:57,558 --> 00:46:00,737
You can do a lot of stuff here as well..

478
00:46:01,308 --> 00:46:02,695
You can call anyone uncle..

479
00:46:03,183 --> 00:46:04,461
Uncle, take the glass.

480
00:46:05,766 --> 00:46:08,783
Can dance where ever you wish...

481
00:46:10,683 --> 00:46:11,133
Come on...

482
00:46:12,766 --> 00:46:13,364
You said, right...

483
00:46:14,266 --> 00:46:15,891
You wanted people...

484
00:46:16,933 --> 00:46:18,414
Here they are... come..

485
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:26,337
Just a minute... one minute..
take off your shoes.. youíll feel it.

486
00:46:50,433 --> 00:46:53,448
Come closer..
everything will melt in 15 minutes...

487
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:56,033
Itís ice.. it will take some time to melt...

488
00:46:56,391 --> 00:46:57,206
Just imagine..

489
00:47:38,141 --> 00:47:42,075
Girls have passed that stage...
They take it very casually...

490
00:47:54,350 --> 00:47:56,048
They get mad if you dominate...

491
00:48:00,058 --> 00:48:00,532
Wonít you?

492
00:48:02,266 --> 00:48:03,845
Itís all because of you...

493
00:48:04,433 --> 00:48:06,095
Your insecurities and your doubts...

494
00:48:06,295 --> 00:48:08,543
We have turned out to be like this
because of your unnecessary attitude.

495
00:48:09,141 --> 00:48:11,476
We lost our sensitivities...
Itís dropped down completely.

496
00:48:11,933 --> 00:48:15,353
Or we are the smoothest
and gentlest of all.

497
00:48:26,683 --> 00:48:29,022
We heard that you are going
to sell the factory and now..

498
00:48:29,266 --> 00:48:30,448
Are you planning to start another one?

499
00:48:31,808 --> 00:48:34,022
Father, I'm going to granny's place
everyone are there.

500
00:48:35,641 --> 00:48:39,204
Before giving anyone any chance to point out,
heís starting up on his own...

501
00:48:39,404 --> 00:48:41,570
Is that okay? Everyone will be fine, right?

502
00:48:43,141 --> 00:48:45,360
Your son makes me happy at times like these.

503
00:48:45,975 --> 00:48:49,264
He can manage with just about anyone..

504
00:48:49,725 --> 00:48:50,920
Unlike you.

505
00:48:54,266 --> 00:48:56,788
Many people need us in our place...
why do we care about Amaravati.

506
00:48:56,888 --> 00:48:59,956
You started the purchases again?
Which side is it?

507
00:49:00,516 --> 00:49:02,029
I've been standing on my word
since long time.

508
00:49:02,229 --> 00:49:05,515
You can keep it on top of your head...
or wherever you wish... oh, you blind fools...

509
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:06,726
Till your brother-in-law stands beside you...

510
00:49:08,183 --> 00:49:10,807
Look, he used to walk around here...
he used to sell the paints here...

511
00:49:11,558 --> 00:49:13,925
He became a great man today...
and continues to be the greatest...

512
00:49:14,475 --> 00:49:17,632
I am talking to you... where are you looking?
We are not hesitant about anything...

513
00:49:18,308 --> 00:49:20,571
We always have to say one thing...
we are straight..

514
00:49:21,141 --> 00:49:23,495
So brother-in-law, did you buy lands for the factory?
- Stop it, you..

515
00:49:24,141 --> 00:49:27,744
I like visiting your aunt once in a month...

516
00:49:28,058 --> 00:49:29,554
We just saw her. They are all there...

517
00:49:30,225 --> 00:49:32,825
Let me know if your intending
to get your son married...

518
00:49:33,266 --> 00:49:35,828
My son is doing some business in South Africa..

519
00:49:36,141 --> 00:49:38,920
Heís minting money.. I have no idea how...

520
00:49:39,308 --> 00:49:42,280
You say yes, Iíll ask him to dump
as much money as you want..

521
00:49:42,891 --> 00:49:44,250
Hey... Hey!

522
00:49:44,850 --> 00:49:45,560
Brother-in-law..

523
00:49:46,808 --> 00:49:49,173
Let me say it first..
is everyone ready?

524
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:51,089
Weíll get started..
- Ok then, see you later...

525
00:49:53,808 --> 00:49:55,725
Mother-In-law, we shall meet again.

526
00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:57,627
Take care, I will call you.

527
00:49:58,391 --> 00:50:01,936
Aunty, One selfie please...
-What is wrong with you let's go...

528
00:50:03,058 --> 00:50:04,972
Hey, why didnít you get the older one?

529
00:50:05,558 --> 00:50:07,460
Sheíll come if she wants to.. not when we call her..

530
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:09,921
she doesnít think too much, just like me

531
00:50:10,641 --> 00:50:11,375
Call your uncle..

532
00:50:12,016 --> 00:50:12,518
Uncle...

533
00:50:15,683 --> 00:50:16,057
Bujji...

534
00:50:17,641 --> 00:50:18,093
Give it to her...

535
00:50:21,141 --> 00:50:22,570
Mother...
-What is it?

536
00:50:23,141 --> 00:50:23,492
Take it.

537
00:50:25,141 --> 00:50:25,706
Mother, take it...

538
00:50:27,808 --> 00:50:30,102
Are you giving or him?
- Itís him..

539
00:50:30,808 --> 00:50:31,418
Is that true?

540
00:50:32,350 --> 00:50:34,598
Are you giving or him?
- Itís him..

541
00:50:35,183 --> 00:50:37,197
Anyway youíre gonna give it to the kids,
so.. take it..

542
00:50:38,891 --> 00:50:43,034
Iíll take it if he gives...
I wonít take it if you give...

543
00:50:43,933 --> 00:50:48,009
I got her married to someone random
because she was not my own daughter...

544
00:50:49,016 --> 00:50:51,416
Her time was good... that sheís so happy today...

545
00:50:52,516 --> 00:50:55,468
Or I would have been so upset with myself...

546
00:50:55,933 --> 00:50:58,876
I am unable to come there
because of this reason only...

547
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:04,621
when we went through bad times...
he took you...and helped so much...

548
00:51:05,516 --> 00:51:06,672
let me tell you something...

549
00:51:07,475 --> 00:51:11,276
I know you kids too well...

550
00:51:13,183 --> 00:51:15,494
Donít insult him even in your dreams...

551
00:51:19,058 --> 00:51:22,957
Invite the kids home next week...
theyíll stay here for a week.

552
00:51:23,933 --> 00:51:26,204
Sheís been talking about you..
-Stop. Letís go.

553
00:51:31,433 --> 00:51:33,448
My father gave this too...
-Get lost.

554
00:51:37,975 --> 00:51:40,020
Lift it, brother...
you are Lord hanuman.. Lift it..

555
00:51:40,725 --> 00:51:41,982
Did we get them all? -Uncle.

556
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:43,727
I am gonna sneeze..
Are you gonna sneeze as well?

557
00:51:44,641 --> 00:51:44,966
Sneeze.

558
00:51:45,475 --> 00:51:46,303
Sneeze.
-Sneeze.

559
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:47,600
Sneeze.
-Sneeze!

560
00:51:51,308 --> 00:51:52,397
What happened?
-He dropped it down.

561
00:51:53,016 --> 00:51:56,265
Mother, sheís carrying fatherís diary.
What would she do now?

562
00:51:58,350 --> 00:52:00,145
Why are you carrying Fatherís diary?

563
00:52:01,225 --> 00:52:03,669
Like the democracy of the country,
this is our familyís democracy.

564
00:52:04,183 --> 00:52:05,195
This is uncleís diary...

565
00:52:05,766 --> 00:52:10,771
Weíll find all the solutions of the world
once we open this diary.

566
00:52:10,975 --> 00:52:12,413
Whatís your problem now?

567
00:52:12,683 --> 00:52:15,825
Brother didnít write anything on this page..
that means the problems are over?

568
00:52:21,266 --> 00:52:23,097
Can I use this space, brother-in-law?

569
00:52:23,391 --> 00:52:23,975
Sure.

570
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:27,812
If the world is a stage and
we are all actors...

571
00:52:28,475 --> 00:52:31,951
Why hide the acting skills then?
Why canít we act openly?

572
00:52:33,141 --> 00:52:35,496
Donít look at me like that,
brother-in-law.. I  lose track...

573
00:52:36,308 --> 00:52:37,121
You carry on...

574
00:52:39,266 --> 00:52:41,687
My father wants to get us married...

575
00:52:42,266 --> 00:52:44,043
I wonít accept or deny...

576
00:52:44,725 --> 00:52:48,308
If I accept and the wedding doesnít happen
itís a huge problem...

577
00:52:49,266 --> 00:52:54,714
If I deny and we end up getting married
then they ask me why...

578
00:52:54,975 --> 00:52:55,647
Now thatís the problem...

579
00:52:56,391 --> 00:53:01,107
so, letís just watch
whatís gonna happen on the stage.

580
00:53:01,641 --> 00:53:03,818
What else can we do, brother-in-law?

581
00:53:04,850 --> 00:53:11,031
If thereís some sweet magic between
a guy and girl..

582
00:53:11,683 --> 00:53:12,624
That must surely work out...

583
00:53:24,058 --> 00:53:27,022
We can guess the mindset by the colors...
-Letís play?

584
00:53:31,058 --> 00:53:31,387
Red.

585
00:53:32,350 --> 00:53:33,016
Restlessness.

586
00:53:33,391 --> 00:53:34,760
I thought the colour
Iím gonna put on your forehead.

587
00:53:35,350 --> 00:53:36,712
If you canít take it...

588
00:53:38,308 --> 00:53:40,560
Tell me in advance...

589
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:42,206
You will fall in order to save me...

590
00:53:43,308 --> 00:53:46,520
I am getting attracted to you ...

591
00:53:46,808 --> 00:53:48,911
So itís done, right?

592
00:53:52,475 --> 00:53:54,933
But you continue to love me.. I like it..

593
00:53:56,683 --> 00:53:58,047
Doesnít feel like love..

594
00:53:59,558 --> 00:54:00,714
Guys are like torture...

595
00:54:02,641 --> 00:54:04,521
But... you have to tolerate me.

596
00:54:08,433 --> 00:54:10,679
Black is for negativity.

597
00:54:11,891 --> 00:54:14,480
I thought the colour of your kohl..
- How can say that?

598
00:54:15,350 --> 00:54:16,987
I will cover everything like colour black..

599
00:54:18,850 --> 00:54:19,660
I am short tempered..

600
00:54:20,683 --> 00:54:21,653
But I respect my anger..

601
00:54:22,558 --> 00:54:25,184
I can't tolerate...
but, I respect my intolerance..

602
00:54:26,266 --> 00:54:27,530
Itís in my nature...

603
00:54:28,141 --> 00:54:29,709
And I respect it.

604
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:33,766
I respect my anger, I respect my confusion,
I respect my jealousy... I respect my feelings..

605
00:54:33,808 --> 00:54:35,070
I respect all my feelings.

606
00:54:44,975 --> 00:54:46,487
All the colours are within you..

607
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:48,585
Why are you thinking so much?

608
00:54:49,850 --> 00:54:50,899
Become one among us..

609
00:54:52,058 --> 00:54:52,808
Everything will fall into place..

610
00:55:03,733 --> 00:55:05,533
Why are you getting crushed?

611
00:55:05,850 --> 00:55:08,221
Go and tell that you want to get
your daughter married to him..

612
00:55:09,350 --> 00:55:11,540
Look at yoru face.. darn you..

613
00:55:12,230 --> 00:55:16,038
I cant believe youíre my son..
you irritate me so much..

614
00:55:16,238 --> 00:55:19,267
Can i tell you something...
you really donít want to get her married...

615
00:55:19,467 --> 00:55:21,013
You want to leave right away..

616
00:55:34,391 --> 00:55:36,023
Hey, look!

617
00:55:40,558 --> 00:55:41,723
Did you observe too?

618
00:55:42,933 --> 00:55:43,579
No, brother-in-law...

619
00:55:44,516 --> 00:55:46,982
If you accept, the next good thing
thatís gonna happen is your sonís wedding..

620
00:55:47,433 --> 00:55:48,092
With his daughter...

621
00:55:48,975 --> 00:55:51,775
He is tensed whether to disclose it or no..

622
00:56:13,433 --> 00:56:16,749
Looks like thereís something.
He has a weird feeling.

623
00:56:17,475 --> 00:56:21,209
He's been writing something.
He'll come and tell now.

624
00:56:36,141 --> 00:56:36,558
Hey...

625
00:56:40,558 --> 00:56:40,929
Hey!

626
00:57:29,433 --> 00:57:32,814
Why are you getting restless
when I am trying to tell something..

627
00:57:33,014 --> 00:57:36,193
We can talk later.
Can we play these games now?

628
00:57:37,766 --> 00:57:38,639
Ha ha ha...

629
00:57:41,933 --> 00:57:42,449
Whatís with life..

630
00:57:43,058 --> 00:57:45,703
Feels really long already...

631
00:57:46,558 --> 00:57:48,861
Okay, letís go out on a tour..

632
00:57:49,225 --> 00:57:49,600
Tour?

633
00:57:50,350 --> 00:57:50,932
Yes, everybody..

634
00:58:09,558 --> 00:58:13,026
"Play and sing with others..."

635
00:58:15,350 --> 00:58:18,822
"Speak with other hearts..."

636
00:58:20,850 --> 00:58:23,711
"Befriend others hearts..."

637
00:58:24,183 --> 00:58:26,644
"The long way of the journey..."

638
00:58:27,141 --> 00:58:29,575
"The steps that make the journey..."

639
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:32,833
"Sing and play... Sing and play!"

640
00:58:33,033 --> 00:58:35,808
"If this moment is true.."

641
00:58:38,850 --> 00:58:41,915
"Won't we think of a better tomorrow..."

642
00:58:44,683 --> 00:58:47,815
"If we get used to this fete..."

643
00:58:50,183 --> 00:58:53,580
"Won't we crave for it again and again..."

644
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:30,650
"Things we saw... things we haven't..."

645
00:59:31,475 --> 00:59:35,383
"What we see becomes delightful..."

646
00:59:37,391 --> 00:59:39,268
"For one and for all..."

647
00:59:43,183 --> 00:59:47,709
"Wouldn't that be for everyone..."

648
00:59:49,808 --> 00:59:55,007
"I find out things about myself..."

649
00:59:55,575 --> 01:00:00,502
"I learn gossip about you..."

650
01:00:00,910 --> 01:00:03,298
"I ask.. I find out..."

651
01:00:03,641 --> 01:00:06,402
"But it's all in the family!'

652
01:00:06,641 --> 01:00:09,716
"If this moment is true.."

653
01:00:12,475 --> 01:00:15,453
"Won't we think of a better tomorrow..."

654
01:00:18,350 --> 01:00:21,453
"If we get used to this fete..."

655
01:00:23,850 --> 01:00:27,162
"Won't we crave for it again and again..."

656
01:00:33,891 --> 01:00:34,303
Where are you going?

657
01:00:42,433 --> 01:00:44,777
Why am I restricting so much...
Should I just say?

658
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:49,169
Going away from him
and this feeling is very hard...

659
01:00:52,225 --> 01:00:53,136
But, would I suit him?

660
01:00:57,016 --> 01:01:00,559
Hey Cutee, Come on...

661
01:01:13,266 --> 01:01:18,091
"Whatever is there and
whatever has to be..."

662
01:01:19,058 --> 01:01:23,052
"Wouldn't that be wonderful?"

663
01:01:24,975 --> 01:01:34,932
"If we all walk together...
Wouldn't the distance reduce to half..."

664
01:01:37,391 --> 01:01:42,643
"Dreams hidden in our eyes..."

665
01:01:43,266 --> 01:01:48,281
"Must come true deep from the heart..."

666
01:01:48,457 --> 01:01:54,025
"Let's see them.. let's live them..
And it's all in the family!"

667
01:01:54,266 --> 01:01:57,269
"If this moment is true.."

668
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:03,308
"Won't we think of a better tomorrow..."

669
01:02:05,975 --> 01:02:09,223
"If we get used to this fete..."

670
01:02:11,475 --> 01:02:14,854
"Won't we crave for it again and again..."

671
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:24,723
I am forgetting everything
with so many people around..

672
01:02:26,308 --> 01:02:30,828
I told you about all my ambitions, right?

673
01:02:32,475 --> 01:02:36,471
What if I tell you that I changed my mind
and wish to stay here forever..

674
01:02:37,016 --> 01:02:37,791
How would you feel?

675
01:02:38,850 --> 01:02:39,730
Whatís with the sudden decision?

676
01:02:46,247 --> 01:02:48,968
Hey hey.. slow...
I asked you not to come, right?

677
01:02:50,583 --> 01:02:53,783
Go sit there...
-Ok.

678
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,431
Wonít you play?
Playing is boring..

679
01:03:05,666 --> 01:03:06,144
Bore?

680
01:03:06,833 --> 01:03:08,710
Ha ha... you believed me?

681
01:03:09,333 --> 01:03:09,784
Hey...

682
01:03:10,541 --> 01:03:12,518
Sitting at home is boring...

683
01:03:13,083 --> 01:03:14,651
Playing is exhausting...

684
01:03:15,083 --> 01:03:16,802
Mom keeps scolding Almighty...

685
01:03:18,458 --> 01:03:20,255
That he cheated us...

686
01:03:20,916 --> 01:03:21,288
Why?

687
01:03:22,250 --> 01:03:23,627
Apparently, I wont live long..

688
01:03:27,166 --> 01:03:30,967
God will take me away..
I will live only for a few days..

689
01:03:33,750 --> 01:03:36,894
So, shall we also cheat Almighty?

690
01:03:37,416 --> 01:03:39,775
How?
-By Praying every day..

691
01:03:41,958 --> 01:03:42,974
Like this...

692
01:03:44,083 --> 01:03:45,275
Keep praying him everyday...

693
01:03:46,750 --> 01:03:48,434
Not today.. Iíll come tomorrow...

694
01:03:49,083 --> 01:03:50,035
So, he wonít take me away?

695
01:03:50,541 --> 01:03:52,444
Almighty is a nice person...

696
01:03:53,625 --> 01:03:55,001
He gets cheated very easily...

697
01:04:03,166 --> 01:04:05,579
She is a 4 year old kid...

698
01:04:06,250 --> 01:04:09,995
Why does she have to go
through all this?

699
01:05:11,541 --> 01:05:12,202
Shall we loaf around?

700
01:05:25,041 --> 01:05:27,143
Did you say something?
I didnít hear you..

701
01:05:28,958 --> 01:05:29,343
I can't hear you.

702
01:06:00,541 --> 01:06:01,388
You want to leave?

703
01:06:04,666 --> 01:06:07,595
Even if you give me 100 reasons, I'll stop you.

704
01:06:08,333 --> 01:06:08,843
What about 101 reason?

705
01:06:11,916 --> 01:06:13,075
Look... I'm worried about this.

706
01:06:14,708 --> 01:06:17,091
I am worried that youíll stop loving
and start compromising...

707
01:06:21,041 --> 01:06:22,162
Compromising is very difficult...

708
01:06:23,833 --> 01:06:28,576
I get exhausted by the time
I meet all your family members...

709
01:06:30,541 --> 01:06:31,109
And..

710
01:06:32,791 --> 01:06:34,142
To live with them...

711
01:06:36,041 --> 01:06:40,222
When my father comes to stay with me
for a week, I wait for him to leave...

712
01:06:40,858 --> 01:06:46,116
Itís okay to be with everyone once in a while.
but, I canít be like this all the time.

713
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:51,089
Two months! I thought we could
go through this together.

714
01:06:51,541 --> 01:06:53,498
But these two months,
I saw you and your family...

715
01:06:54,083 --> 01:06:55,015
But I couldn't see myself in your family.

716
01:06:56,708 --> 01:06:59,785
I am losing myself every time
I think of you...

717
01:07:01,958 --> 01:07:04,571
My liking might be hesitant...
but it must not be a problem...

718
01:07:05,416 --> 01:07:06,829
I didn't know how to convey..

719
01:07:07,541 --> 01:07:08,587
I canít adjust...

720
01:07:09,625 --> 01:07:10,737
I donít know what to say...

721
01:07:12,541 --> 01:07:15,306
One must not look for words
when they have nothing to say...

722
01:07:19,166 --> 01:07:19,834
Letís end it here...

723
01:07:22,791 --> 01:07:24,630
I have a good opinion about life...

724
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:27,368
There are a lot of adventures ahead...

725
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:30,120
Will meet a lot of people...

726
01:07:31,125 --> 01:07:32,171
Thatís what happened with you...

727
01:07:33,916 --> 01:07:34,759
But I canít stop here...

728
01:07:36,833 --> 01:07:37,647
Must move on..

729
01:07:48,833 --> 01:07:50,442
Lets free ourselves from each other...

730
01:08:18,466 --> 01:08:19,053
I told you, right?

731
01:08:20,375 --> 01:08:22,654
Guys just need a hug and a kiss...

732
01:08:43,332 --> 01:08:44,522
Hey, read this article..

733
01:08:45,082 --> 01:08:47,332
Uncle, I think father left last night.

734
01:09:18,064 --> 01:09:23,490
<<Phone Ringing>>

735
01:09:26,041 --> 01:09:26,385
Hello...

736
01:09:28,082 --> 01:09:29,281
Is he up?
- Yes.

737
01:09:30,207 --> 01:09:31,557
All of you come here for breakfast..

738
01:09:38,125 --> 01:09:41,787
Father hasnít been at peace
since uncle left without informing...

739
01:09:41,979 --> 01:09:42,575
<<Phone Ringing>>

740
01:09:42,666 --> 01:09:44,662
Heís been calling him all night.
- Hello.

741
01:09:47,375 --> 01:09:47,719
Iím coming..

742
01:09:50,416 --> 01:09:50,877
I'll be right back...

743
01:09:51,916 --> 01:09:54,154
Why donít you eat and go...
-That will clearly take time..

744
01:09:54,541 --> 01:09:55,287
Iíll be back.. okay..

745
01:10:04,583 --> 01:10:10,088
What happened?
Whom did you run into?

746
01:10:10,288 --> 01:10:12,053
I was lost in thoughts and ran into the...

747
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:15,074
They say itís not my mistake...
he was driving very fast...

748
01:10:15,625 --> 01:10:17,753
I was thinking about Kasi, brother-in-law...

749
01:10:19,791 --> 01:10:24,704
My father saw you hug and kiss
that girl and he came back...

750
01:10:25,166 --> 01:10:27,216
I heard my parents speaking...

751
01:10:28,083 --> 01:10:32,003
Anyway, when will people learn
to accept things, brother-in-law?

752
01:10:36,083 --> 01:10:36,748
Take it..
-No.

753
01:10:38,416 --> 01:10:38,852
Take it..

754
01:10:58,494 --> 01:11:04,608
What happened?
- A small injury, thatís all.

755
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,674
You must be careful, girl.. one minute..

756
01:11:10,333 --> 01:11:10,681
Give this.

757
01:11:12,333 --> 01:11:12,803
No, donít give..

758
01:11:15,708 --> 01:11:16,297
Wait for a minute...

759
01:11:17,708 --> 01:11:19,041
No one must give it... Weíll pay for it...

760
01:11:20,833 --> 01:11:21,766
We will pay.

761
01:11:23,375 --> 01:11:24,235
Thanks.
-Thank you, sir..

762
01:11:29,583 --> 01:11:30,019
What happened, uncle?

763
01:11:30,441 --> 01:11:32,202
Like we donít have?
Or you think you have too much?

764
01:11:33,250 --> 01:11:35,002
Why are you giving money
to random people?

765
01:11:38,041 --> 01:11:39,100
You ask for good things when I say this...

766
01:11:39,416 --> 01:11:42,355
You think we canít talk?
Or are you teaching us something new?

767
01:11:45,458 --> 01:11:47,259
You want to play your games from sunrise.

768
01:11:47,451 --> 01:11:50,475
you think we canít live?
Or do you know something?

769
01:11:50,791 --> 01:11:51,802
How do I find out?

770
01:11:52,250 --> 01:11:53,758
Uncle, weíll talk about it later..

771
01:11:54,291 --> 01:11:56,015
No, letís talk right here. Everyone must know..

772
01:11:56,458 --> 01:11:58,380
What happened?
What are you talking about?

773
01:11:58,791 --> 01:11:59,396
Bring it on...

774
01:12:00,041 --> 01:12:02,529
Bring on the anger.
Everyone must get angry now.

775
01:12:03,041 --> 01:12:05,127
My words must hit people today.

776
01:12:05,625 --> 01:12:08,225
Uncle...
-Hey.. come here.

777
01:12:09,875 --> 01:12:11,582
What is this? What do you want?

778
01:12:12,291 --> 01:12:13,645
For what did you bring me here?

779
01:12:15,458 --> 01:12:16,119
You think we donít have enough money?

780
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:18,181
Not because we arenít wealthy enough...

781
01:12:18,666 --> 01:12:19,093
Father, come...

782
01:12:19,458 --> 01:12:23,138
But because you are scared, youíre lazy.
you need people around you.

783
01:12:23,583 --> 01:12:24,605
You brought them here to show.

784
01:12:28,166 --> 01:12:29,577
If we say something,
you stop us by saying let me say it first...

785
01:12:29,833 --> 01:12:31,272
Donít we know things? Canít we say?

786
01:12:33,375 --> 01:12:35,769
Thought weíll make some money
by selling the factory...

787
01:12:36,083 --> 01:12:36,982
You said, weíll all stay together...

788
01:12:37,625 --> 01:12:39,732
I thought Iíll get my daughter
married to your son...

789
01:12:40,208 --> 01:12:42,096
But we donít know
whatís on his mind...

790
01:12:42,583 --> 01:12:44,701
Iím sure you know... Drama!

791
01:12:45,541 --> 01:12:46,455
To play with us...

792
01:12:47,208 --> 01:12:48,409
Youíve been playing with us
right from the starting.

793
01:12:48,833 --> 01:12:52,260
Everyone gets ready for this...
Everyone has kids...

794
01:12:53,958 --> 01:12:57,588
Any small occasion, They just walk in...

795
01:13:00,125 --> 01:13:02,344
Get naggy.. nag for everything.

796
01:13:02,712 --> 01:13:05,151
About your greatness.
What about that greatness?

797
01:13:07,458 --> 01:13:10,286
You look here and there when we begin
to talk something... and then we look directionless...

798
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,716
You think 100 times before taking a decision...
and we start thinking...

799
01:13:14,416 --> 01:13:15,867
We are getting scared... so are you...

800
01:13:16,083 --> 01:13:18,844
we wish.. and so do you...
What about the greatness now?

801
01:13:19,583 --> 01:13:21,588
Who is going to teach here?
Who is here to learn anyway?

802
01:13:24,625 --> 01:13:25,842
Tell him...

803
01:13:26,541 --> 01:13:28,214
Itís all because of you...
You are playing the game, right?

804
01:13:28,750 --> 01:13:31,943
After your father itís going to be you...
Weíll still be your slaves.. Say it?

805
01:13:33,958 --> 01:13:34,776
Donít we wanna grow?

806
01:13:35,666 --> 01:13:38,005
Donít we wanna make names for ourselves?

807
01:13:38,416 --> 01:13:41,207
People say that we are hopeless
without your father. Theyíll say it.

808
01:13:41,541 --> 01:13:42,915
Itís a harmless thing to comment.
They say it out of affection.

809
01:13:43,291 --> 01:13:43,581
Ask him to come..

810
01:13:44,041 --> 01:13:46,769
letís make him stand here ...
weíll figure out the greatness...

811
01:13:52,166 --> 01:13:54,740
Hey, no! Let us live our lives.. Leave us!
-Uncle..

812
01:14:41,687 --> 01:14:46,428
You keep giving money
to people just like me?

813
01:14:47,833 --> 01:14:48,402
I do, father..

814
01:14:49,208 --> 01:14:50,575
Give it..

815
01:14:51,541 --> 01:14:53,993
Things you give away never go...
it will come back to us...

816
01:14:54,666 --> 01:14:54,966
Yes...

817
01:14:57,166 --> 01:14:59,830
Is my belief right?

818
01:15:00,125 --> 01:15:02,132
Of course, father..
whatever you believe is right!

819
01:15:04,166 --> 01:15:05,040
Why did he go?

820
01:15:05,958 --> 01:15:08,366
Let him go.
other three are still here, right?

821
01:15:10,750 --> 01:15:13,357
You are too much.
How can I let him go?

822
01:15:14,250 --> 01:15:14,703
Itís him today..

823
01:15:15,416 --> 01:15:17,633
Itís going to be someone else tomorrow...
someone else later...

824
01:15:17,983 --> 01:15:18,482
Then?

825
01:15:19,166 --> 01:15:22,369
100 mistakes are acceptable...
never let go off people..

826
01:15:23,416 --> 01:15:24,623
You must keep them close to you...

827
01:15:25,541 --> 01:15:27,769
I donít know who I am
and who my people are...

828
01:15:28,958 --> 01:15:30,441
Except for my fatherís photographs...

829
01:15:31,458 --> 01:15:34,617
I thought just one from my childhood
is enough for me...

830
01:15:35,583 --> 01:15:39,124
He doesnít know the joy of living
with your loved ones...

831
01:15:39,458 --> 01:15:43,388
Had he knows the importance of being
there for one another, he wouldnít have left...

832
01:15:43,875 --> 01:15:45,120
I am a common man...

833
01:15:47,125 --> 01:15:48,091
Very normal...

834
01:15:51,958 --> 01:15:52,826
We are all normal...

835
01:15:55,791 --> 01:15:57,318
Thatís exactly why we must be
there for each other, right?

836
01:16:00,708 --> 01:16:01,192
By the way...

837
01:16:04,333 --> 01:16:05,245
My belief...

838
01:16:07,958 --> 01:16:08,603
Isn't it right?

839
01:16:15,458 --> 01:16:15,844
Father...

840
01:16:17,458 --> 01:16:18,858
I never got an opportunity...

841
01:16:20,291 --> 01:16:20,918
I am saying it now..

842
01:16:22,375 --> 01:16:23,663
I really like you, father...

843
01:16:24,916 --> 01:16:25,678
No just like... love..

844
01:16:26,708 --> 01:16:27,089
You are my life...

845
01:16:28,916 --> 01:16:33,517
I respect all the hardships you went through...

846
01:16:35,416 --> 01:16:35,957
One more thing...

847
01:16:37,041 --> 01:16:40,110
You always say... let me say it first...

848
01:16:41,333 --> 01:16:42,915
I know a lot of people
get angry for that.

849
01:16:46,041 --> 01:16:46,831
But let me tell you..

850
01:16:48,333 --> 01:16:48,994
You must only have the first say...

851
01:16:50,250 --> 01:16:51,012
And then everybody else...

852
01:16:52,250 --> 01:16:53,265
You have that right, father..

853
01:16:54,375 --> 01:16:56,979
You must say it first, father... no one else..

854
01:16:59,458 --> 01:17:01,610
Not just them..if you think so...

855
01:17:02,833 --> 01:17:04,432
You are very capable, son...

856
01:17:05,333 --> 01:17:07,295
Okay... you are right...

857
01:17:09,333 --> 01:17:12,489
Let him go away.
other three are still here.

858
01:17:13,833 --> 01:17:18,005
Make sure retain those three... forever...

859
01:17:20,375 --> 01:17:20,802
Oh...

860
01:17:22,041 --> 01:17:22,744
I am here, right?

861
01:17:24,750 --> 01:17:25,645
Why am I telling you...

862
01:17:28,791 --> 01:17:30,576
Why am I really telling you?

863
01:17:58,458 --> 01:18:00,661
I donít need anyone... let them all go...

864
01:18:01,750 --> 01:18:03,250
I need my husband and no one else..

865
01:18:44,583 --> 01:18:45,540
Father...

866
01:18:47,666 --> 01:18:48,708
Father...

867
01:18:50,625 --> 01:18:52,166
Say something nice, father...

868
01:18:53,083 --> 01:18:54,040
Father...

869
01:18:54,875 --> 01:18:56,041
Say something nice...

870
01:18:56,500 --> 01:18:57,375
Father...

871
01:18:58,166 --> 01:18:59,458
Say something nice, Father...

872
01:19:10,352 --> 01:19:11,486
Say something nice, Father...

873
01:21:12,463 --> 01:21:18,451
If we wait for a month...
we can sell off all the products.

874
01:21:18,552 --> 01:21:21,702
You will say anything,
Thereís no bell to the cycle..

875
01:21:21,903 --> 01:21:23,264
So what?

876
01:21:23,347 --> 01:21:24,472
I have a mouth, right?
- So..

877
01:21:24,555 --> 01:21:27,764
Sing something... people will move away..

878
01:21:27,805 --> 01:21:35,139
"What happened?
Tam tam.. it flew away... tam tam.."

879
01:21:39,330 --> 01:21:43,382
Raji, ask your mother to come..
- Weíll be back in the morning..

880
01:21:45,764 --> 01:21:46,473
Weíll talk later..

881
01:22:03,889 --> 01:22:06,930
Vara lakshmi, I forgot to ask you...

882
01:22:07,305 --> 01:22:10,930
I am not sure if he ate.. can you please ask..

883
01:22:11,680 --> 01:22:12,825
Just check with Lakshmi.

884
01:22:19,847 --> 01:22:21,472
Eat!

885
01:22:26,264 --> 01:22:28,871
Why did we all leave..

886
01:22:29,805 --> 01:22:35,847
One must have it in them to feed...
We left because we donít have such habits..

887
01:22:36,347 --> 01:22:40,554
Aunt, serve me some rice.. aunt, some more..

888
01:22:41,097 --> 01:22:43,222
Despite so much transparency,

889
01:22:44,430 --> 01:22:45,921
You hid so much in you.

890
01:23:02,347 --> 01:23:06,459
I can talk to my father..
but only you have the right to talk about him...

891
01:23:08,305 --> 01:23:10,444
Why has my father considered him close..

892
01:23:12,097 --> 01:23:13,186
Why did he give him so much importance..

893
01:23:13,555 --> 01:23:16,896
You father needs just one thing...
togetherness...

894
01:23:17,630 --> 01:23:18,950
Being together..

895
01:23:19,252 --> 01:23:20,930
He never asked for anything more than that..

896
01:23:21,953 --> 01:23:23,297
Lucky is the one who understood that..

897
01:23:23,874 --> 01:23:25,063
He will taste elixir...

898
01:23:26,115 --> 01:23:27,605
Canít do much about the one who doesnít...

899
01:23:28,037 --> 01:23:32,081
Why didnít you raise your voice
when he came to sell the factory?

900
01:23:32,473 --> 01:23:35,970
Why didnít you talk
when they were raising a hue and cry in their house?

901
01:23:36,258 --> 01:23:38,130
Why did you think so much about him?

902
01:23:39,794 --> 01:23:40,843
Even you need him, right?

903
01:23:43,196 --> 01:23:45,468
<<Phone ringing>>

904
01:23:47,011 --> 01:23:47,570
Hello..

905
01:23:48,955 --> 01:23:49,606
Iíll be there..

906
01:23:57,015 --> 01:24:00,173
I am your sisterís friend.. from London..
can I come in?

907
01:24:00,382 --> 01:24:00,705
Sure.

908
01:24:01,205 --> 01:24:04,085
My friends have also come..
Thatís okay.. ask them to come in..

909
01:24:05,221 --> 01:24:05,843
Come..

910
01:24:12,789 --> 01:24:15,009
While I was coming in the train.. I met a few people..

911
01:24:15,425 --> 01:24:16,615
They have come to visit Durga temple...

912
01:24:16,715 --> 01:24:19,744
I got them here
instead of them looking for a place to stay.

913
01:24:20,077 --> 01:24:22,767
Sheís just like you!

914
01:24:23,566 --> 01:24:24,031
Come...

915
01:24:31,580 --> 01:24:32,105
Sister-in-law..

916
01:24:37,330 --> 01:24:41,705
Why? Itís not a good idea..
- Thatís okay.. please donít hesitate..

917
01:24:42,164 --> 01:24:45,205
No, girl..
- Let me say first..

918
01:24:48,039 --> 01:24:49,580
Allow me to say first..

919
01:24:49,789 --> 01:24:53,205
The house would be so dull
if so many people donít stay..

920
01:24:53,414 --> 01:24:54,867
Just go and freshen up..

921
01:25:06,455 --> 01:25:09,033
I thought a bit before getting them here...

922
01:25:09,497 --> 01:25:11,520
Then I thought itíd be great if I take them..
so I got them along...

923
01:25:13,955 --> 01:25:17,148
Isnít it better if they eat here?

924
01:25:20,622 --> 01:25:22,639
I am here to witness Brahmotsavam.

925
01:25:22,914 --> 01:25:25,840
I thought iíll catch up with youíll before I go..

926
01:25:26,040 --> 01:25:29,338
But I feel like staying back after seeing you all..
I can stay here?

927
01:25:35,455 --> 01:25:38,664
I must watch my slang
to get my point across I guess..

928
01:25:39,108 --> 01:25:40,898
I am talking to you.. Can I stay here?

929
01:25:57,955 --> 01:26:02,089
What is this, mother?
This girl runs a customized boutique in London.

930
01:26:03,050 --> 01:26:07,402
She makes customized gifts as per request..

931
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:10,773
She handed over the job to me now..

932
01:26:25,455 --> 01:26:29,510
Finally, I was thinking about the gift
and found your wedding video...

933
01:26:29,802 --> 01:26:32,509
May be the blouse from your wedding video..
Iíll send that..

934
01:26:34,122 --> 01:26:36,283
Your daughter and I have seen
the video several times...

935
01:26:37,122 --> 01:26:43,199
The fear in you
when they take you in your bridal dress..

936
01:26:43,622 --> 01:26:47,111
I think it was your brother.. the worry on his face..

937
01:26:47,383 --> 01:26:49,525
Like the whole responsibility
of the wedding is on him..

938
01:26:49,872 --> 01:26:50,810
Uncle..

939
01:26:54,372 --> 01:27:00,477
A girl who is worried about
what is happening around her...

940
01:27:00,677 --> 01:27:04,201
A satisfaction that the mother
will take care of everything,

941
01:27:04,402 --> 01:27:05,761
You must have seen a lot of that, right?

942
01:27:08,497 --> 01:27:11,791
Is that fear really true? Or the courage?

943
01:27:14,539 --> 01:27:15,581
Hold my hand...

944
01:27:21,372 --> 01:27:22,029
Itís the courage.

945
01:27:22,330 --> 01:27:23,649
Ha ha ha...

946
01:27:26,330 --> 01:27:27,781
Boy, wonít you talk?

947
01:27:39,622 --> 01:27:42,250
I must watch my slang
to get my point across I guess...

948
01:27:43,455 --> 01:27:45,955
I bet on India for 1000 bucks.. you?

949
01:27:46,514 --> 01:27:49,817
Girl friends turn out to be like this
when boy friends donít care..

950
01:27:49,917 --> 01:27:52,248
Listen, boy...
he already has a girl friend..

951
01:27:52,705 --> 01:27:54,681
The girl is amazing...

952
01:27:57,122 --> 01:27:58,705
The girl is amazing, right?

953
01:27:59,580 --> 01:28:01,830
Did you ever see a mole on the waist?
No..

954
01:28:03,039 --> 01:28:03,646
She has one..

955
01:28:04,164 --> 01:28:05,830
Who is this girl?
- Her?

956
01:28:06,039 --> 01:28:06,955
Sheís like a candle..

957
01:28:07,247 --> 01:28:09,267
We wouldnít know that itís lit..
and she wouldnít know that sheís on fire..

958
01:28:11,747 --> 01:28:14,497
I didnít think much..
just said what I wanted to say..

959
01:28:15,580 --> 01:28:16,539
Lets meet uncle..

960
01:28:18,122 --> 01:28:20,830
Boss, Get back to your job..
Ok ok...

961
01:28:21,205 --> 01:28:22,053
Drink it baby.

962
01:28:23,330 --> 01:28:27,070
Your brother-in-law passed away because of you..
thatís what the world says...

963
01:28:27,539 --> 01:28:29,606
Would he die of an argument?

964
01:28:29,806 --> 01:28:33,366
In that case many people must die..
thatís your take on it..

965
01:28:33,567 --> 01:28:36,688
Did you say something so bad?
Is my question...

966
01:28:37,080 --> 01:28:40,401
In order to make a point... is my answer..

967
01:28:41,830 --> 01:28:42,397
Uncle...

968
01:28:49,830 --> 01:28:52,784
Uncle, will you come home?
Or shall I come there? Tell me, uncle?

969
01:28:53,414 --> 01:28:56,035
Letís go together...
Iíll stay home until then..

970
01:28:59,080 --> 01:29:03,295
You are still showing off
your fatherís greatness?

971
01:29:03,573 --> 01:29:05,296
Leave that, uncle..
Why?

972
01:29:06,192 --> 01:29:09,052
I am now the bad guy..
and itís only because of your father..

973
01:29:10,330 --> 01:29:12,476
I hear things right from morning.. not your father..

974
01:29:12,577 --> 01:29:13,995
I couldnít laugh while he did...

975
01:29:14,195 --> 01:29:17,847
I couldnít talk but he did..
how can I ever be the nice guy?

976
01:29:20,427 --> 01:29:24,353
Why are you hesitating to go
when youíve been called? Is my question.

977
01:29:24,914 --> 01:29:28,922
If I understand your feelings and take away your assets,
youíd be happy, right?

978
01:29:29,455 --> 01:29:30,848
Whatever has happened has happened..

979
01:29:31,080 --> 01:29:36,251
Your father is dead now...
Do his job now, thatís public opinion.

980
01:29:36,622 --> 01:29:37,914
Letís not talk about it now.

981
01:29:38,789 --> 01:29:39,664
Letís go home, uncle..

982
01:29:39,705 --> 01:29:46,204
Hey.. Youíd know, if i said a few good things
and made you and your father run around me.

983
01:29:46,622 --> 01:29:48,534
Itís not hot only in the summers.

984
01:29:48,594 --> 01:29:53,052
We see things like this, right?
Thatís when it gets hot...

985
01:29:53,152 --> 01:29:54,413
Go away!

986
01:30:12,455 --> 01:30:14,918
Put that song...
- Ok..

987
01:30:31,830 --> 01:30:35,080
See whatever you want to see.. Iíll say when you see.

988
01:30:43,455 --> 01:30:47,894
He wonít sell his company..
why do we need his company? Is your question..

989
01:30:48,205 --> 01:30:52,675
Weíll get the company no matter what...
spend as much as it takes.. is my answer...

990
01:30:53,330 --> 01:30:57,142
Am I his strength or weakness? Is your question..

991
01:30:57,342 --> 01:31:00,706
Iíll use whatever it is.. is my answer..

992
01:31:01,997 --> 01:31:04,025
Why are they using me?

993
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:44,121
I thought itís better to look at you from close..
so, came here..

994
01:31:45,997 --> 01:31:46,592
Youíre good.

995
01:31:47,289 --> 01:31:48,080
Come...
Where to?

996
01:31:48,539 --> 01:31:50,663
Motherís all alone.. Letís go chat with her..

997
01:32:09,164 --> 01:32:11,746
Thereís been too much entertainment
in the house since two days..

998
01:32:11,955 --> 01:32:15,579
Some people are not talking to each other...
but everyone is talking the same thing..

999
01:32:15,821 --> 01:32:16,320
What is it?

1000
01:32:17,372 --> 01:32:20,705
You went to meet uncle, right? About that..

1001
01:32:21,330 --> 01:32:22,789
What is there in that?

1002
01:32:23,205 --> 01:32:27,247
I didnít understand anything...
What did they understand?

1003
01:32:27,872 --> 01:32:30,914
come, see it for yourself..

1004
01:32:34,664 --> 01:32:38,121
Are you listening, brother?
Had I known, Iíd have stopped him...

1005
01:32:39,080 --> 01:32:40,205
Iíd have dealt it in a different manner..

1006
01:32:40,247 --> 01:32:44,247
That is why your not dealing...
These guys are better...

1007
01:32:44,372 --> 01:32:45,539
Come...

1008
01:32:47,789 --> 01:32:53,580
I didnít talk about this to anyone else but you..
neither.. I didnít discuss it with anyone..

1009
01:32:53,622 --> 01:32:55,578
What?
What are you talking about?

1010
01:32:55,914 --> 01:32:57,806
This wonít end now.. lets go..

1011
01:33:03,429 --> 01:33:07,654
Uncle is short tempered.
Brother-in-law is very patient..

1012
01:33:08,539 --> 01:33:14,246
Brother-in-law is very senstitive...
he took her instead of taking me.. I felt very bad..

1013
01:33:14,330 --> 01:33:15,247
Me too..

1014
01:33:15,330 --> 01:33:17,663
What?
felt very bad..

1015
01:33:18,789 --> 01:33:24,080
We can deal with this... itís very
difficult to make them understand..

1016
01:33:24,580 --> 01:33:26,311
We must keep them engaged..

1017
01:33:27,705 --> 01:33:28,238
Marriage.

1018
01:33:34,789 --> 01:33:38,465
Finally, you guys have managed
to deal with that man.

1019
01:33:38,914 --> 01:33:41,925
Where is your brotherís left, right and center?

1020
01:33:42,272 --> 01:33:43,821
Heís thinking of ways to deal with you..

1021
01:33:44,021 --> 01:33:47,688
Hey.. where do you get this shirts from..
he looks good in them.

1022
01:33:48,372 --> 01:33:50,872
That kind of person should always be there...

1023
01:33:51,122 --> 01:33:53,622
Here.. heís getting very bored..

1024
01:33:53,705 --> 01:33:55,789
Why?
You are here for marriage?

1025
01:33:55,914 --> 01:33:57,568
You were saying something? Say it...

1026
01:34:00,247 --> 01:34:01,820
You donít have the courage to say it?

1027
01:34:16,289 --> 01:34:20,580
The brideís side have come to the function?
With faces like that..

1028
01:34:20,622 --> 01:34:24,210
Itís alike they got a great chance to dress up..

1029
01:34:26,955 --> 01:34:31,082
Is it real or fake? You dressed up the girl too?

1030
01:34:32,122 --> 01:34:34,059
Whatís up, new girl?

1031
01:34:34,381 --> 01:34:37,110
You are talking for the guy?
What is with you?

1032
01:34:37,310 --> 01:34:39,377
Which guy? This one or the other?

1033
01:34:41,914 --> 01:34:46,244
You want your guy to woo the girl
and take her away?

1034
01:34:46,664 --> 01:34:50,884
Enough of it.. we must find out about the guy first..

1035
01:34:51,085 --> 01:34:54,178
Thereís Seetha in one ritual.. radha in another..

1036
01:34:54,378 --> 01:34:57,235
Different girls for different rituals..
how can we trust him?

1037
01:34:57,580 --> 01:34:59,890
How can we trust your girl then?

1038
01:35:00,247 --> 01:35:03,347
Her name is lakshmi.. who is very unstable...

1039
01:35:03,547 --> 01:35:08,039
Whatís the assurance that
she wonít leave our boy?

1040
01:35:09,747 --> 01:35:12,279
We donít need such girls.. you can keep her...

1041
01:35:12,479 --> 01:35:16,042
We will.. We donít think itís a burden..
Whatís with that look?

1042
01:35:16,943 --> 01:35:21,205
And that smell..
Why did you accept this proposal?

1043
01:35:21,414 --> 01:35:25,096
Where was your girl born?
In a lotus? In the dirty pond?

1044
01:35:25,372 --> 01:35:28,607
Our guy doesnít like it at all..

1045
01:35:28,807 --> 01:35:31,873
What does he like?
he likes forests and mountains..

1046
01:35:32,205 --> 01:35:35,518
You'll leave our girl in the forest?
What does your girl like?

1047
01:35:35,718 --> 01:35:38,372
She like basil leaves..
To attack our boy?

1048
01:35:38,497 --> 01:35:39,552
So you're fooling us?

1049
01:35:39,872 --> 01:35:40,546
Then what about us?

1050
01:35:40,746 --> 01:35:45,789
Why should we budge?
why should we?

1051
01:35:46,247 --> 01:35:48,830
Why should we?

1052
01:35:49,039 --> 01:35:51,246
Hey, Stop it.

1053
01:35:53,539 --> 01:35:55,124
Stop it...

1054
01:35:56,198 --> 01:35:57,771
Get them married properly..

1055
01:35:58,220 --> 01:36:00,622
We wonít budge..

1056
01:36:01,914 --> 01:36:05,539
We wonít budge..

1057
01:36:05,747 --> 01:36:06,904
Stop..

1058
01:36:07,449 --> 01:36:11,619
Before we get two people married..
we look back at the 7 generations..

1059
01:36:12,872 --> 01:36:16,500
Who is his father? Grand father? Great grand father..
Tell us about it..

1060
01:36:16,700 --> 01:36:22,236
How far is Tirupati from Aluveli mangapuram?
And vice versa..

1061
01:36:22,492 --> 01:36:23,773
You tell us first..

1062
01:36:24,307 --> 01:36:27,461
His name is Anantha..
fatherís name is Govinda.

1063
01:36:27,561 --> 01:36:29,955
His name is Srinivasa.. now you tell us..

1064
01:36:30,872 --> 01:36:35,497
Her name is Sridevi, fatherís name is Ksheradhri,
grand fatherís anme is Ratnakara..

1065
01:36:35,539 --> 01:36:37,148
Great grandfatherís name is Vishwambhara..

1066
01:36:38,789 --> 01:36:41,965
Vishwambharaís fatherís name
is Vishwambhara grandpa..

1067
01:36:43,289 --> 01:36:47,355
7 generations.. Innumerable people..

1068
01:36:48,330 --> 01:36:50,440
People you wouldnít want to lose..

1069
01:36:50,830 --> 01:36:55,213
Even if we find about 50 people,
we can visit each every holiday...

1070
01:36:55,313 --> 01:36:57,057
70-80 people can survive..

1071
01:36:59,372 --> 01:37:03,650
I feel bad for the men though..
- Why?

1072
01:37:03,850 --> 01:37:06,036
They have to bear..

1073
01:37:07,830 --> 01:37:10,264
The same surname... itís better for us..

1074
01:37:11,330 --> 01:37:15,344
One life and two surnames..
thereís a constant excitement, right?

1075
01:37:17,176 --> 01:37:18,814
You understood everything yesterday?

1076
01:37:19,289 --> 01:37:23,776
I have complete clarity now..
No one asks us to be stable.. must kick him first..

1077
01:37:24,583 --> 01:37:30,277
If we keep bouncing around like a ball..
we can go anywhere.. meet anyone..

1078
01:37:34,539 --> 01:37:37,273
Are you thinking about it?
- I think so..

1079
01:37:37,473 --> 01:37:39,070
Itís okay, right?
Whatís okay?

1080
01:37:39,461 --> 01:37:41,661
When?
Today..

1081
01:37:41,839 --> 01:37:44,515
Today? Is that okay?
itís right if itís now!

1082
01:37:44,715 --> 01:37:47,047
Shall we tell the uncles..
or theyíll think we are eloping..

1083
01:37:47,238 --> 01:37:49,126
To the aunts..
theyíll confirm it..

1084
01:37:49,326 --> 01:37:51,423
To the kids..
They already think so..

1085
01:37:51,623 --> 01:37:53,120
What do we do?
Mother...

1086
01:37:58,622 --> 01:38:01,580
We are starting now..
weíll get married and come back..

1087
01:38:02,164 --> 01:38:02,664
Bye...

1088
01:38:04,330 --> 01:38:05,320
Oy!

1089
01:38:05,789 --> 01:38:08,371
Ha ha ha...

1090
01:38:09,269 --> 01:38:11,079
You said it..
Yes.

1091
01:38:11,789 --> 01:38:13,441
I didnít think youíll come..

1092
01:38:15,664 --> 01:38:17,888
Iíve been feeling very lonely lately..

1093
01:38:19,122 --> 01:38:20,669
when you guys were talking yesterday..

1094
01:38:21,789 --> 01:38:22,625
I felt that no one can be alone..

1095
01:38:23,539 --> 01:38:25,062
If we look, weíll find many people..

1096
01:38:26,205 --> 01:38:27,206
So, letís just find them...

1097
01:38:41,539 --> 01:38:45,441
"Every moment spent with you..."

1098
01:38:49,247 --> 01:38:52,989
"Is absolutely marvellous..."

1099
01:38:55,455 --> 01:39:02,330
"Any time, any way together..."

1100
01:39:02,622 --> 01:39:11,247
"A wish that makes you forget it all..."

1101
01:39:18,830 --> 01:39:24,997
"Every way is taking us
towards a celebration..."

1102
01:39:26,455 --> 01:39:32,705
"Every moment passed must be
spent like a celebration..."

1103
01:39:33,914 --> 01:39:40,164
"Our destinations and our journeys
are a celebration..."

1104
01:39:41,664 --> 01:39:47,267
"Our relatives are like
lights in celebrations!"

1105
01:39:51,528 --> 01:39:54,013
My dad used to tell me
about his native village.

1106
01:39:57,188 --> 01:39:58,276
I never came here before.

1107
01:39:58,980 --> 01:40:01,987
No one recognize me here and nor do i...

1108
01:40:07,689 --> 01:40:08,161
Who?

1109
01:40:08,524 --> 01:40:11,992
My father used to stay opposite this house.
I am his son...

1110
01:40:12,738 --> 01:40:16,682
You are Chantibabuís son? Whatís the matter?

1111
01:40:16,980 --> 01:40:20,855
My family apparently used to stay here...
I am here to find out about them..

1112
01:40:21,605 --> 01:40:24,175
What will you do finding out?
Just to catch up..

1113
01:40:24,376 --> 01:40:26,113
Catch up and...?
- catch up and talk..

1114
01:40:26,771 --> 01:40:27,742
What will you talk about?

1115
01:40:29,146 --> 01:40:33,197
I donít have any answers to your questions.
I just wanna meet them...

1116
01:40:34,313 --> 01:40:38,402
You guys are too much... They are all landlords...

1117
01:40:38,849 --> 01:40:39,896
They donít stay at one place...

1118
01:40:40,382 --> 01:40:43,230
They started getting into
various businesses and moved apart...

1119
01:40:43,563 --> 01:40:45,021
According to my knowledge,

1120
01:40:45,551 --> 01:40:48,247
Some of them are in Nagpur...

1121
01:40:48,896 --> 01:40:50,563
I must be having their addresses... wait..

1122
01:40:50,771 --> 01:40:52,250
Then, why did you stay back?

1123
01:40:52,605 --> 01:40:57,937
Why? We look for friends as kids,
to meet and hang out...

1124
01:40:58,355 --> 01:41:02,405
When we grow old we tell those stories...

1125
01:41:02,813 --> 01:41:05,336
We grow little older and
then we listen to others stories...

1126
01:41:05,810 --> 01:41:10,527
When we are awake in the morning,
People would greet us...

1127
01:41:10,730 --> 01:41:12,317
Isnít that enough, son?

1128
01:41:14,771 --> 01:41:15,376
Son..

1129
01:41:16,923 --> 01:41:19,911
Not till we get exhausted...
search till you understand this...

1130
01:41:43,396 --> 01:41:46,521
Listen, relative... If you need help, ask.

1131
01:41:46,855 --> 01:41:48,321
I will do my bit...

1132
01:41:48,771 --> 01:41:54,254
If you need more help, ask.
Iíll strive harder and do my bit...

1133
01:41:54,771 --> 01:41:58,075
Not required... We donít need any help.

1134
01:41:58,480 --> 01:42:01,693
If I take help, Iíll have to bow to you in the future...

1135
01:42:02,355 --> 01:42:04,545
Not required... Donít trap us...

1136
01:42:06,396 --> 01:42:08,178
Life will go on!

1137
01:42:08,646 --> 01:42:11,230
Will life go on? You wonít bow...

1138
01:42:11,271 --> 01:42:13,771
You wonít listen to anyone... isnít that against nature?

1139
01:42:13,961 --> 01:42:17,530
We all came to make a living
here few years ago...

1140
01:42:17,948 --> 01:42:19,668
We taught tricks and tips to people here...

1141
01:42:19,904 --> 01:42:22,121
I grew up because I was intelligent.

1142
01:42:22,501 --> 01:42:25,769
I donít care about the way...
If we start fighting wonít be become a joke to them?

1143
01:42:26,230 --> 01:42:28,463
You wonít support me if I am a bad guy?

1144
01:42:28,896 --> 01:42:31,313
You will not listen to anyone...
Wonít care about anyone..

1145
01:42:31,521 --> 01:42:33,197
How will nature accept this?

1146
01:42:35,146 --> 01:42:38,178
Iíll deal with this myself..
But what if they donít let me..

1147
01:42:42,980 --> 01:42:46,343
How much can one suffer...
Even my enemies must not deal with such situations..

1148
01:42:50,980 --> 01:42:53,637
This is my destiny. A curse from the past...

1149
01:42:55,355 --> 01:42:56,607
Howís the guy in the photo related to you?

1150
01:42:57,730 --> 01:42:59,357
Who are you? Why do you want to know?

1151
01:43:00,896 --> 01:43:02,998
Tell me, lady...
howís the guy in the photo related to you?

1152
01:43:04,688 --> 01:43:06,449
My grandfather.. who are you?

1153
01:43:06,649 --> 01:43:07,897
So, how will his son be related to you?

1154
01:43:09,063 --> 01:43:11,534
Heís be my uncle maybe..
And his son...

1155
01:43:12,646 --> 01:43:14,404
His son.. who are you?

1156
01:43:14,605 --> 01:43:15,264
Tell me, lady..

1157
01:43:16,521 --> 01:43:17,896
A brother...

1158
01:43:17,938 --> 01:43:19,974
And his son?
Nephew...

1159
01:43:23,271 --> 01:43:26,124
How can your nephew not react to this..

1160
01:43:26,391 --> 01:43:27,663
Hold on.. Iíll be back..
Listen...

1161
01:43:27,896 --> 01:43:29,196
I donít need anyoneís help..

1162
01:43:29,480 --> 01:43:32,300
Like he was not enough
that you are now adding to my misery...

1163
01:43:36,730 --> 01:43:38,849
Life is craving...
the village is craving for its reputation..

1164
01:43:39,836 --> 01:43:42,407
Both arenít there now..
Hold on.. Iíll be back..

1165
01:43:42,980 --> 01:43:44,900
What is he doing here?
- He came out.

1166
01:43:47,644 --> 01:43:50,837
Could you please stop that...
Weíll talk in the evening...

1167
01:43:51,813 --> 01:43:52,942
Iíll look after everything...

1168
01:43:54,646 --> 01:43:55,740
She is someone who matters to me..

1169
01:43:56,563 --> 01:43:59,102
Oh, relative... itís foolishness..

1170
01:43:59,202 --> 01:44:01,630
The entire village is foolish...
Look at their faces...

1171
01:44:03,605 --> 01:44:05,544
I am conducting this auction...

1172
01:44:06,021 --> 01:44:09,164
she has a husband...
heís not around when I need to meet...

1173
01:44:09,586 --> 01:44:12,021
Heís gone... She thinks I did it.

1174
01:44:12,393 --> 01:44:14,923
Oh, relative... Itís true..

1175
01:44:18,480 --> 01:44:21,271
Why am I still talking instead of hitting you...

1176
01:44:21,480 --> 01:44:25,633
I am used to hitting and talking...
How can I lose my habit...

1177
01:44:25,938 --> 01:44:29,773
If you repeat her mistake.. how can you
stand like that.. you must feel ashamed..

1178
01:44:29,873 --> 01:44:31,947
You must learn todayís way of life..

1179
01:44:32,148 --> 01:44:34,777
Hey, Nagpur relatives.. go hit him on his waist..

1180
01:44:35,230 --> 01:44:38,312
His jaw... his abdomen...

1181
01:44:46,355 --> 01:44:48,968
I must not think too much.. Must fight back!

1182
01:44:49,980 --> 01:44:50,937
Oh...

1183
01:44:52,021 --> 01:44:53,700
Now his slang has changed...

1184
01:44:57,855 --> 01:44:59,134
Why aren't you hitting him...

1185
01:45:40,021 --> 01:45:43,771
Prove it to him that iím his relative... or...
Break his spine...

1186
01:45:43,855 --> 01:45:45,129
Do something, guys...

1187
01:45:45,329 --> 01:45:48,244
You darn Nagpur relatives... do something..

1188
01:46:11,730 --> 01:46:13,102
Write down the address before you leave...

1189
01:46:14,063 --> 01:46:17,105
Will invite you for weddings.. you guys can join!
Bloody relatives!

1190
01:46:24,438 --> 01:46:26,900
I am seeing this picture out of my house
for the first time..

1191
01:46:30,021 --> 01:46:32,059
My father used to look at this picture
every time he had any problem...

1192
01:46:34,813 --> 01:46:36,980
I very often feel...

1193
01:46:38,105 --> 01:46:42,543
That I might have brothers...

1194
01:46:43,374 --> 01:46:45,553
I was sure.. they were there..

1195
01:46:47,188 --> 01:46:50,188
But everyone had their own mess to deal with...

1196
01:46:50,605 --> 01:46:52,075
Canít blame anyone..

1197
01:46:52,980 --> 01:46:53,654
So, come back..

1198
01:46:55,105 --> 01:46:56,048
Our house is huge...

1199
01:46:59,438 --> 01:47:03,237
I can visit sometime..

1200
01:47:03,684 --> 01:47:07,594
But under such circumstances Iíll never come back..

1201
01:47:26,105 --> 01:47:33,687
"We race with ourselves everyday...
for whatever reasons..."

1202
01:47:33,771 --> 01:47:41,646
"Sample"

1203
01:47:42,146 --> 01:47:44,896
"If you don't have it within you..."

1204
01:47:46,063 --> 01:47:49,480
"It's not there in your house too..."

1205
01:47:49,855 --> 01:47:54,562
"If you don't have it within you...
It's not there in your house too..."

1206
01:47:54,730 --> 01:47:58,146
"It's your inner feeling."

1207
01:48:04,855 --> 01:48:10,646
"Every way is taking us
towards a celebration..."

1208
01:48:12,480 --> 01:48:18,271
"Every moment passed must be
spent like a celebration..."

1209
01:48:19,980 --> 01:48:25,896
"Our destinations and
our journeys are a celebration..."

1210
01:48:27,688 --> 01:48:33,688
"Our relatives are like
lights in celebrations!"

1211
01:48:39,230 --> 01:48:41,031
Lakkavarapu Lingaraju... a.k.a Lilly!

1212
01:48:42,771 --> 01:48:43,362
Coming...

1213
01:48:45,896 --> 01:48:46,442
Jabong?

1214
01:48:47,730 --> 01:48:48,325
Flipkart?

1215
01:48:48,688 --> 01:48:51,882
let me guess... You guys look classy..
Amazon maybe...

1216
01:48:52,355 --> 01:48:53,599
I hope you guys are not our relatives..

1217
01:48:54,188 --> 01:48:56,605
I donít have an opinion or impression on them...
Later...

1218
01:48:58,605 --> 01:48:59,605
Oh no...

1219
01:49:00,396 --> 01:49:02,159
What?
- Is this you in the picture?

1220
01:49:02,359 --> 01:49:02,771
Crap!

1221
01:49:03,230 --> 01:49:06,441
Your aunt from Nagpur gave it to us..
They gave it.. but why did you come?

1222
01:49:06,771 --> 01:49:09,139
Relatives, right? Thought of catching up..

1223
01:49:09,771 --> 01:49:10,635
Oh no!

1224
01:49:10,855 --> 01:49:13,616
You have relatives..
donít you feel like talking to them?

1225
01:49:13,969 --> 01:49:14,806
Who, bro?

1226
01:49:15,006 --> 01:49:16,816
Uncles, aunts, grandparents..

1227
01:49:17,264 --> 01:49:20,315
Only if possible, or I just donít care...

1228
01:49:21,605 --> 01:49:22,544
why are you looking at me like that?

1229
01:49:23,230 --> 01:49:23,749
Anger?

1230
01:49:24,396 --> 01:49:25,159
Irritation?

1231
01:49:25,480 --> 01:49:27,088
Did I hurt your feelings?

1232
01:49:27,437 --> 01:49:31,774
No, Lilly... When you turn 60...
you need someone to look after you, right?

1233
01:49:34,438 --> 01:49:37,983
I will hire two hot nurses like you.
Do you have any problem with that?

1234
01:49:52,230 --> 01:49:54,994
Baríterierors Etírashins

1235
01:49:55,194 --> 01:49:57,554
Can you just speak in Telugu...

1236
01:49:57,654 --> 01:49:58,764
Sorry...
Hey!

1237
01:49:59,396 --> 01:50:01,592
Donít worry, Lilly... heís your cousin..

1238
01:50:01,792 --> 01:50:02,960
Heís pretty rich..

1239
01:50:03,060 --> 01:50:04,492
Arenít we?

1240
01:50:04,592 --> 01:50:07,806
Listen, thatís the problem with relatives...
they never accept anything about others...

1241
01:50:08,171 --> 01:50:10,288
Thatís a good status... put it up
on facebook... donít tell me...

1242
01:50:10,896 --> 01:50:11,741
And here after...

1243
01:50:12,063 --> 01:50:15,155
All the moments of this journey are in Instagram.
are you guys on Instagram?

1244
01:50:15,671 --> 01:50:16,574
I donít think so..

1245
01:50:16,813 --> 01:50:18,839
itís on twitter as well.. I am on whatsapp...

1246
01:50:19,230 --> 01:50:23,449
And you guys donít waste your time
by talking to each other..

1247
01:50:23,634 --> 01:50:25,441
Use technology instead..
itís pretty user friendly..

1248
01:50:25,465 --> 01:50:25,973
Give it to me..

1249
01:50:26,261 --> 01:50:27,116
The software is getting updated.

1250
01:50:27,372 --> 01:50:31,356
Hey, Are you crazy?
Oh.. I lost my phone.. why?

1251
01:50:32,105 --> 01:50:33,460
Henceforth, you will be my addiction..

1252
01:50:34,021 --> 01:50:36,125
You must always be with me, go around with me

1253
01:50:36,521 --> 01:50:37,647
And socialize with people..

1254
01:51:04,855 --> 01:51:05,857
Lilly, where are we?

1255
01:51:06,980 --> 01:51:09,026
You werenít so surprised after I was hit, sir..

1256
01:51:09,646 --> 01:51:12,795
You are asking me after 450 Km of drive..
we are in Haridwar...

1257
01:51:13,646 --> 01:51:17,643
Isnít it amazing... right or left.. I guess itís right..

1258
01:51:17,900 --> 01:51:20,204
So, we came here taking a right...
and we are in Haridwar...

1259
01:51:23,855 --> 01:51:26,103
Whatís it, brother? Why are they taking a dip?

1260
01:51:26,449 --> 01:51:29,321
Heights of stupidity.. ha ha ha..

1261
01:51:34,896 --> 01:51:37,875
You dipped me so many times
just for slip of the tongue...

1262
01:51:38,105 --> 01:51:41,022
You donít know about your grandfather?
You donít know about your great-grand father

1263
01:51:42,355 --> 01:51:45,111
What is with you?
You are here because of them, right?

1264
01:51:45,212 --> 01:51:49,969
Whatís the point of you are not grateful?
Haridwar has answers to everything... Go!

1265
01:51:50,694 --> 01:52:03,687
Om Nama Shivvaya!

1266
01:52:03,730 --> 01:52:05,477
What do you mean by it, brother?
Generations!

1267
01:52:06,396 --> 01:52:09,846
1,2,3,4,5,6,7... 7 generations?

1268
01:52:10,230 --> 01:52:13,474
You are looking for 7 generations...
doesnít that sound stupid?

1269
01:52:32,438 --> 01:52:34,371
Whatís your name and ëgotraí?

1270
01:52:35,605 --> 01:52:36,388
Where are you from?

1271
01:52:37,396 --> 01:52:38,260
Tell him...

1272
01:52:39,271 --> 01:52:41,445
Telugu.. you wonít get it here..

1273
01:52:41,545 --> 01:52:42,332
Move on..

1274
01:52:42,646 --> 01:52:45,767
Oh, stop this nonsense.. letís leave!

1275
01:52:48,313 --> 01:52:51,009
If you keep looking with an address,
you canít find what you want, brother...

1276
01:52:51,521 --> 01:52:54,451
By the way, whose idea was it to load around
and look without addresses..

1277
01:52:54,838 --> 01:52:56,837
Mine!
Pink Devil.

1278
01:52:57,313 --> 01:52:59,977
if i had my phone,
Iíd have looked up on Google maps...

1279
01:53:00,730 --> 01:53:02,380
Iím seeing this for the first time..

1280
01:53:06,188 --> 01:53:08,315
Do you really have to complicate
so much for relatives?

1281
01:53:15,355 --> 01:53:19,087
Weíll get to know about North-India here..
Madya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Bihar, Rajasthan...

1282
01:53:19,396 --> 01:53:22,768
Aggarwal's, Champaklal's, Ullals,
Varma's, Sharma's, Khanna's only...

1283
01:53:23,021 --> 01:53:24,489
You must go to Kaasi
to find the details of south Indians..

1284
01:53:26,355 --> 01:53:27,459
So, letís go to Kaasi..

1285
01:53:28,654 --> 01:53:30,183
Even I must come along?
Of course...

1286
01:53:30,484 --> 01:53:45,464
<<Song>>

1287
01:53:46,605 --> 01:53:48,454
You must quit your favourite something
at Kaasi they say, right, brother?

1288
01:53:48,675 --> 01:53:51,099
Letís leave her. We can happily go home!

1289
01:54:22,396 --> 01:54:24,110
Why are you suddenly feeling so bad?

1290
01:54:24,688 --> 01:54:26,484
My feelings magnify every time I see her like that...

1291
01:54:27,563 --> 01:54:28,629
Magnify?

1292
01:54:29,521 --> 01:54:31,322
And mine multiply further...

1293
01:54:39,688 --> 01:54:41,766
In terms of feelings, everyoneís the same for me...

1294
01:55:01,063 --> 01:55:03,100
Bro, youíre so much better...
You are in the first stage...

1295
01:55:03,336 --> 01:55:05,771
This guy is too much, drawing stuff...

1296
01:55:05,971 --> 01:55:08,468
Government has started Aadhar card surveys, brother..

1297
01:55:08,855 --> 01:55:12,251
Thereís an application link between them...
if we figure out, weíll get all the addresses...

1298
01:55:12,813 --> 01:55:14,790
Are you from Vijaywada? We are from Amalapuram..

1299
01:55:14,990 --> 01:55:16,530
Our guy has sent you here..

1300
01:55:16,637 --> 01:55:20,058
If someone or the other hadnít come here,
this wouldnít have been there...

1301
01:55:20,259 --> 01:55:22,467
Many with your surname live here..

1302
01:55:22,667 --> 01:55:24,453
But Iím not sure
if they are your relatives..

1303
01:55:24,855 --> 01:55:26,478
Iíve an idea.. Iíll give your their address...

1304
01:55:26,861 --> 01:55:29,431
Youíll get the details if you go there..

1305
01:55:34,730 --> 01:55:38,879
Bro, please don't look at me like that...
Lilly is tired..

1306
01:55:39,079 --> 01:55:41,978
Going around with you...
I got lot of experience...

1307
01:55:48,228 --> 01:55:49,371
Rooms are full in this hotel,

1308
01:55:50,027 --> 01:55:51,623
They have one room
but we can use it for 30 minutes only.

1309
01:55:58,736 --> 01:56:01,010
We have 30 minutes it seems...
Will that be enough?

1310
01:56:01,211 --> 01:56:02,715
Enough.
For what?

1311
01:56:04,278 --> 01:56:06,328
Some times even 30 minutes is too much...

1312
01:56:06,702 --> 01:56:08,269
More than enough.
For what?

1313
01:56:10,669 --> 01:56:12,892
He knows everything, but acts as if he is innocent.

1314
01:56:13,807 --> 01:56:16,099
Did he see near that Toll gate?
Which Toll gate?

1315
01:56:16,528 --> 01:56:18,361
He defienitly didn't see that...

1316
01:56:18,653 --> 01:56:21,940
May be he saw on the Highway
near that speed breaker?

1317
01:56:22,361 --> 01:56:25,050
May be on the way to Kasi...
Or may be Haridwar?

1318
01:56:26,069 --> 01:56:28,129
I don't think so...
He was sleeping then...

1319
01:56:29,236 --> 01:56:32,458
Going around with them
I'm not understanding anything...

1320
01:56:33,319 --> 01:56:34,408
What's happeneing?

1321
01:56:35,028 --> 01:56:36,927
You didn't sleep... you saw.

1322
01:56:37,217 --> 01:56:38,549
What are you talking about...

1323
01:56:38,929 --> 01:56:39,916
You saw.

1324
01:56:40,116 --> 01:56:40,863
I didn't see.

1325
01:56:41,063 --> 01:56:43,019
You saw...

1326
01:56:43,043 --> 01:56:45,362
I'm really not understanding
what you are talking...

1327
01:56:45,462 --> 01:56:48,344
He saw.
I didn't see it. Darn it!

1328
01:56:48,444 --> 01:56:50,757
He saw everything...
Brother...

1329
01:56:51,451 --> 01:56:53,050
I'm telling you with affection...

1330
01:56:53,250 --> 01:56:55,843
I don't know why you committed with this girl...
She isn't hot.

1331
01:56:55,860 --> 01:56:57,334
Look at the way she is talking...
Vulgar Crap!

1332
01:56:58,435 --> 01:57:00,669
Even now I'm so silent...
It's all because of my manners...

1333
01:57:00,909 --> 01:57:06,298
Why are you laughing?
He saw everything...

1334
01:57:06,398 --> 01:57:07,010
What the hell!

1335
01:57:07,486 --> 01:57:09,193
What did I see?

1336
01:57:09,497 --> 01:57:11,434
Lilly knows us very well now...

1337
01:57:40,778 --> 01:57:42,366
Your relatives house is very big...

1338
01:57:43,069 --> 01:57:44,155
Is anyone here?

1339
01:57:44,736 --> 01:57:45,785
I don't think so.

1340
01:57:46,861 --> 01:57:48,688
Your relatives wouldn't lock the doors?

1341
01:58:12,094 --> 01:58:14,192
With 20 people in the house it feels like a party..

1342
01:58:14,986 --> 01:58:18,611
I canít imagine
how 200 people would have managed...

1343
01:58:19,153 --> 01:58:21,312
The number of rooms..
The number of stories..

1344
01:58:23,909 --> 01:58:27,820
20 kids from 20 years of wedlock...

1345
01:58:28,325 --> 01:58:32,278
There education, clothing, weddings.. and kids...

1346
01:58:32,819 --> 01:58:34,439
Expenses have increased drastically...

1347
01:58:35,361 --> 01:58:39,303
But even now, you wait for me when I get late..

1348
01:58:39,565 --> 01:58:41,112
You just havenít changed..

1349
01:58:42,136 --> 01:58:43,799
If you are on a high how I can control myself..

1350
01:58:44,345 --> 01:58:45,371
Why would I?

1351
01:58:46,194 --> 01:58:47,237
Can I tell you something?

1352
01:58:47,694 --> 01:58:49,433
The 19th daughter-in-law...

1353
01:58:49,691 --> 01:58:53,597
She said, whatís it mother-in-law?
You look so young even at this age...

1354
01:58:53,797 --> 01:58:57,910
Darn... whatís there, girl.. look at
your father-in-law, heís so handsome...

1355
01:58:58,010 --> 01:59:01,386
Heíll look like that for
the next 20-30 years...

1356
01:59:01,586 --> 01:59:02,605
Hey, 12th boy...

1357
01:59:02,944 --> 01:59:05,518
Hey, 7th girl..
Where is he? The 20th one..

1358
01:59:05,887 --> 01:59:06,642
Hey 20th boy...

1359
01:59:08,794 --> 01:59:11,264
"Put your hands up!"

1360
01:59:11,585 --> 01:59:14,770
"Put your hands up!
Rock it on the dance floor..."

1361
01:59:16,336 --> 01:59:18,802
"Put your hands up!"

1362
01:59:19,090 --> 01:59:22,304
"Put your hands up!
Shake it on the dance floor..."

1363
01:59:23,471 --> 01:59:25,888
"Put your hands up!"

1364
01:59:26,192 --> 01:59:29,312
"Put your hands up!
Rock it on the dance floor..."

1365
01:59:30,912 --> 01:59:33,391
"Put your hands up!"

1366
01:59:33,711 --> 01:59:37,040
"Put your hands up!
Shake it on the dance floor..."

1367
01:59:38,081 --> 01:59:44,612
"Letís wet the place like raindrops"

1368
01:59:45,612 --> 01:59:52,259
"Letís let go off all the worries..."

1369
01:59:52,915 --> 02:00:00,623
"Thereís a ray of hope
hidden in your heart..."

1370
02:00:00,643 --> 02:00:07,919
"What if you find it here..."

1371
02:00:08,607 --> 02:00:10,863
"Put your hands up..."

1372
02:00:11,199 --> 02:00:14,237
"Put your hands up...
Rock it on the dance floor..."

1373
02:00:15,673 --> 02:00:18,366
"Put your hands up..."

1374
02:00:18,687 --> 02:00:22,076
"Put your hands up...
shaking the dance floor.."

1375
02:00:23,949 --> 02:00:30,750
"The party says,
donít consider your heavy dreams..."

1376
02:00:31,526 --> 02:00:38,376
"This party will bring
back your lost peace.."

1377
02:00:38,856 --> 02:00:45,880
"You donít make
connections just like that..."

1378
02:00:46,489 --> 02:00:53,384
"Weíll do the thinking part..."

1379
02:00:53,452 --> 02:00:55,983
"Put your hands up..."

1380
02:00:56,239 --> 02:00:59,246
"Put your hands up...
Rocking on the dance floor..."

1381
02:01:00,926 --> 02:01:03,391
"Put your hands up..."

1382
02:01:03,679 --> 02:01:07,087
"Put your hands up...
Shaking on the dance floor..."

1383
02:01:08,343 --> 02:01:10,910
"Put your hands up..."

1384
02:01:11,166 --> 02:01:14,493
"Put your hands up...
Rocking on the dance floor..."

1385
02:01:15,901 --> 02:01:18,414
"Put your hands up..."

1386
02:01:18,637 --> 02:01:22,013
"Put your hands up...
Shaking on the dance floor..."

1387
02:01:23,886 --> 02:01:27,567
"Shake it.. shake it.. down..
make your sound.."

1388
02:01:27,589 --> 02:01:31,210
"Shake it.. shake it.. down..
Go.. Go.. round and round..."

1389
02:01:32,059 --> 02:01:37,559
"Party on the house..."

1390
02:01:39,351 --> 02:01:45,958
"We can talk later..."

1391
02:01:46,422 --> 02:01:49,857
"Itís not always the same..
it wonít let you stop.."

1392
02:01:50,146 --> 02:01:53,245
"Time doesnít see whatís ahead"

1393
02:01:53,738 --> 02:02:00,409
"It doesnít leave you like a shadow...
It doesnít walk with you like truth..."

1394
02:02:00,958 --> 02:02:07,755
"This journey will go on by itself.."

1395
02:02:08,076 --> 02:02:15,035
"Thereís a ray of hope
hidden in your heart..."

1396
02:02:16,403 --> 02:02:18,843
"Put your hands up..."

1397
02:02:19,083 --> 02:02:22,331
"Put your hands up...
Rocking on the dance floor..."

1398
02:02:23,891 --> 02:02:26,383
"Put your hands up..."

1399
02:02:26,639 --> 02:02:29,966
"Put your hands up...
Shaking on the dance floor..."

1400
02:02:31,007 --> 02:02:33,887
"Put your hands up..."

1401
02:02:34,127 --> 02:02:37,391
"Put your hands up...
Rocking on the dance floor..."

1402
02:02:39,023 --> 02:02:41,407
"Put your hands up..."

1403
02:02:41,631 --> 02:02:45,026
"Put your hands up...
Shaking on the dance floor..."

1404
02:02:57,539 --> 02:03:00,075
Uncle, Uncle..

1405
02:03:01,259 --> 02:03:01,821
Grandpa..

1406
02:03:03,165 --> 02:03:03,685
Get up..

1407
02:03:04,693 --> 02:03:05,143
Get up..

1408
02:03:05,863 --> 02:03:06,337
Get up..

1409
02:03:11,777 --> 02:03:12,196
Who is it?

1410
02:03:13,586 --> 02:03:16,073
You asked us to meet after the party, right?

1411
02:03:18,419 --> 02:03:19,083
For what?

1412
02:03:21,169 --> 02:03:21,981
We are your relatives..

1413
02:03:22,628 --> 02:03:24,644
Ha ha ha...

1414
02:03:24,745 --> 02:03:25,465
Relatives..

1415
02:03:25,878 --> 02:03:29,085
ha ha ha..

1416
02:03:29,336 --> 02:03:31,588
Relatives... Relatives...

1417
02:03:32,044 --> 02:03:33,095
Why are you riding the cycle..?

1418
02:03:34,063 --> 02:03:35,378
Relatives...

1419
02:03:39,169 --> 02:03:40,029
Now a car..

1420
02:03:41,211 --> 02:03:44,564
Car, bus, train. Flight..I used ëem all...

1421
02:03:46,253 --> 02:03:48,045
You know why?
- Why?

1422
02:03:48,836 --> 02:03:50,863
You know why?
- Why?

1423
02:03:52,211 --> 02:03:53,124
For people..

1424
02:03:54,461 --> 02:03:55,994
I love people around me..

1425
02:03:57,044 --> 02:03:58,740
I like people.. just like you..

1426
02:04:00,044 --> 02:04:03,273
But everyone started using me...

1427
02:04:05,184 --> 02:04:10,980
She loved and married me on someoneís cue...

1428
02:04:14,128 --> 02:04:17,992
So, i went all over the world because
I couldnít find happiness here...

1429
02:04:19,878 --> 02:04:20,447
But...

1430
02:04:22,512 --> 02:04:28,334
But it was people everywhere,
who gave me food to eat...

1431
02:04:31,785 --> 02:04:32,918
Then I decided...

1432
02:04:35,253 --> 02:04:38,342
To stop with people..

1433
02:04:40,836 --> 02:04:41,973
So I decided..

1434
02:04:43,336 --> 02:04:44,688
To party every two days...

1435
02:04:47,044 --> 02:04:49,291
Let them come for alcohol or anything..

1436
02:04:52,711 --> 02:04:54,586
I need people around me..

1437
02:05:00,751 --> 02:05:01,394
Hey...

1438
02:05:05,211 --> 02:05:06,830
My relatives fell asleep..

1439
02:05:08,580 --> 02:05:11,125
Lilly is a jerk! That reminds me..

1440
02:05:11,919 --> 02:05:13,882
I thought they were shots
and nothing would happen..

1441
02:05:15,169 --> 02:05:18,066
My head is spinning now..
- Where?

1442
02:05:20,586 --> 02:05:21,495
I beg you..

1443
02:05:22,044 --> 02:05:23,784
I donít have any energy to answer your questions..

1444
02:05:24,711 --> 02:05:26,016
He said something last night..

1445
02:05:26,836 --> 02:05:28,596
Your uncle said something last night..
What did he say?

1446
02:05:28,884 --> 02:05:29,434
What did he say?

1447
02:05:32,642 --> 02:05:33,607
What did he say?

1448
02:05:55,511 --> 02:05:56,960
He was talking about a light...

1449
02:05:59,773 --> 02:06:00,479
May be not.

1450
02:06:01,846 --> 02:06:02,442
He said something...

1451
02:06:03,628 --> 02:06:04,338
What did he say?

1452
02:06:12,817 --> 02:06:16,551
Uncle might have gone all over
but it feels like I went all over the world...

1453
02:06:19,544 --> 02:06:20,666
He said something towards the end..

1454
02:06:21,836 --> 02:06:22,797
What was it...

1455
02:06:26,086 --> 02:06:27,146
I remember..

1456
02:06:27,961 --> 02:06:28,598
I remember..

1457
02:06:32,836 --> 02:06:34,029
To stop with people...

1458
02:06:35,503 --> 02:06:36,536
To stop with people..

1459
02:06:48,711 --> 02:06:51,365
Ha ha ha...

1460
02:06:53,628 --> 02:06:55,384
Now.. look they are gonna roll and laugh..

1461
02:06:55,878 --> 02:06:58,343
Oh no, my head is still spinning..

1462
02:06:59,128 --> 02:07:01,919
Ha ha ha...

1463
02:07:02,253 --> 02:07:04,650
Done with it.. letís carry on then..

1464
02:07:12,060 --> 02:07:14,166
What is it, brother? You called me to tell something..

1465
02:07:15,169 --> 02:07:19,240
I was minding my own business..
and I saw something..

1466
02:07:20,044 --> 02:07:22,620
Just because I got a little angry..
they blame it on me...

1467
02:07:23,336 --> 02:07:27,009
So, I should have died because of him
and his attitude towards my daughter, right?

1468
02:07:29,086 --> 02:07:30,654
I have ego, thatís why I split...

1469
02:07:30,812 --> 02:07:32,748
You have a bigger ego
thatís why you stayed back...

1470
02:07:34,711 --> 02:07:37,686
You too have daughters, right?
If they go get married by themselves,

1471
02:07:38,378 --> 02:07:39,311
Only then you will know..

1472
02:07:41,211 --> 02:07:43,842
am telling you all this because..
I have just one good thing to say..

1473
02:07:46,770 --> 02:07:49,273
Some calculations.. for anger,
problems have been given to me..

1474
02:07:49,977 --> 02:07:51,507
What has he lost?

1475
02:07:56,419 --> 02:07:59,184
Heís going all over the place..

1476
02:08:01,016 --> 02:08:05,237
Wonít people look for pretty daughters-in-law...

1477
02:08:05,589 --> 02:08:08,480
An intelligent one.. doesn't fit...

1478
02:08:14,263 --> 02:08:15,490
Why wonít he sell?

1479
02:08:15,859 --> 02:08:19,448
Whatís it? Iíll pay a massive amount..

1480
02:08:19,753 --> 02:08:21,268
Tell them, looks like they are crazy...

1481
02:08:21,961 --> 02:08:23,562
I need a decision right now..

1482
02:08:24,503 --> 02:08:24,933
Hang the phone.

1483
02:08:28,794 --> 02:08:29,181
What is it?

1484
02:08:29,711 --> 02:08:30,685
I believe you are a relative..

1485
02:08:31,628 --> 02:08:32,867
Apparently, youíve come from somewhere far...

1486
02:08:34,378 --> 02:08:34,875
Sit...

1487
02:08:38,836 --> 02:08:42,168
I am amid a few tensions.. wanted to buy a factory..

1488
02:08:42,814 --> 02:08:45,307
When heís ready to give it,
no one is understanding the value of it..

1489
02:08:46,419 --> 02:08:49,217
People who know the value arenít giving it, sir..
What did you say?

1490
02:08:49,419 --> 02:08:52,715
You are not buying a factory, sir...
itís their strength when they were together..

1491
02:08:54,003 --> 02:08:55,237
A belief when they split..

1492
02:08:55,794 --> 02:08:56,912
You know nothing

1493
02:08:57,294 --> 02:08:58,079
I know everything..

1494
02:08:58,294 --> 02:08:59,745
What will you do by being together?

1495
02:09:00,128 --> 02:09:02,848
Need not do anything.. Just be together..

1496
02:09:04,419 --> 02:09:08,831
You called me to talk amid all your tensions...
you know why..

1497
02:09:10,044 --> 02:09:11,282
To share the feeling..

1498
02:09:13,003 --> 02:09:14,121
Take it if they give it..

1499
02:09:14,878 --> 02:09:15,679
Theyíll remember you..

1500
02:09:16,503 --> 02:09:18,652
Grab it if they donít give it..
they wont forget you then..

1501
02:09:27,378 --> 02:09:31,128
"Like generations of debt...
and a wish to clear it off..."

1502
02:09:31,211 --> 02:09:34,919
"Wondering who really are our relatives..."

1503
02:09:35,003 --> 02:09:38,753
"A new introduction...
A new experience..."

1504
02:09:38,836 --> 02:09:43,086
"Every turn tells us a new story..."

1505
02:09:43,378 --> 02:09:46,335
"If we observe closely..."

1506
02:09:47,211 --> 02:09:49,961
"We'll figure out the truth..."

1507
02:09:51,044 --> 02:09:58,628
"All the passers by...
Are somehow related to us, right?"

1508
02:10:06,086 --> 02:10:11,669
"Every way is taking us
towards a celebration..."

1509
02:10:13,711 --> 02:10:19,211
"Every moment passed must be
spent like a celebration..."

1510
02:10:21,211 --> 02:10:26,753
"Our destinations and
our journeys are a celebration..."

1511
02:10:28,919 --> 02:10:34,836
"Our relatives are like
lights in celebrations!"

1512
02:10:54,711 --> 02:10:56,756
Every place has something to tell, right?

1513
02:10:57,669 --> 02:10:59,724
Every person we meet has something to teach..

1514
02:11:02,128 --> 02:11:04,240
We can take a lot a advantage of places like these..

1515
02:11:04,544 --> 02:11:05,134
How?

1516
02:11:05,794 --> 02:11:06,869
No! don't...

1517
02:11:07,211 --> 02:11:09,945
Go that side...
what the hell...

1518
02:11:15,878 --> 02:11:17,284
First.. Iíll run..

1519
02:11:20,169 --> 02:11:21,572
Iíll follow you...

1520
02:11:24,169 --> 02:11:27,793
There are colours ahead...
you wonít be able to find me there..

1521
02:11:30,253 --> 02:11:32,297
Then.. Iíll pull your hand.

1522
02:11:35,794 --> 02:11:38,937
Let how many people be around us..
no one will bother...

1523
02:11:39,510 --> 02:11:41,284
I wonít be able to escape from there..

1524
02:11:43,503 --> 02:11:45,025
Then, Iíll almost come closer to you..

1525
02:11:46,669 --> 02:11:48,687
Iíll be very close to you..

1526
02:11:50,878 --> 02:11:51,736
Let's stop it here.

1527
02:11:53,211 --> 02:11:56,538
Sounds amazing..
letís do it..

1528
02:12:02,961 --> 02:12:03,919
No...

1529
02:12:18,044 --> 02:12:19,337
Mother...

1530
02:12:20,253 --> 02:12:21,018
Akshara!

1531
02:12:23,378 --> 02:12:25,794
Letís go the hospital..
No..

1532
02:12:25,836 --> 02:12:29,400
I have to stay alone.. I am scared..

1533
02:12:29,500 --> 02:12:32,538
There are many people here.. Its nice here..

1534
02:12:33,878 --> 02:12:38,346
Letís offer salutations to Almighty..
that Iíll come tomorrow..

1535
02:12:39,586 --> 02:12:42,123
Heís a good guy, heíll believe me..

1536
02:12:42,323 --> 02:12:45,294
letís just go to the hospital
Thereís no point in going to the hospital..

1537
02:12:46,261 --> 02:12:49,352
About a week ago,
doctor said that sheíll leave us..

1538
02:12:51,503 --> 02:12:55,307
If itís about sleep..
I can play while sleeping as well..

1539
02:13:00,003 --> 02:13:01,179
You can play a lot there..

1540
02:13:02,919 --> 02:13:03,881
There are many schools there..

1541
02:13:05,378 --> 02:13:06,807
They start at 9 in the morning.

1542
02:13:08,044 --> 02:13:09,494
And the bell rings at 5 in the evening...

1543
02:13:10,253 --> 02:13:11,696
More over, you donít have to study there..

1544
02:13:12,961 --> 02:13:14,104
You can play all day..

1545
02:13:15,544 --> 02:13:17,065
There will be many leaders before us..

1546
02:13:18,378 --> 02:13:21,075
You can talk to everyone.. you can touch anyone..

1547
02:13:22,003 --> 02:13:23,424
You can see them from very close..

1548
02:13:23,794 --> 02:13:26,296
You can come along with me, right?

1549
02:13:44,586 --> 02:13:52,169
"We race with ourselves everyday...
for whatever reasons..."

1550
02:13:52,253 --> 02:14:00,169
"And a minute doesn't pass
without wanting to win..."

1551
02:14:00,711 --> 02:14:03,503
"What ever is the value of hunger..."

1552
02:14:04,544 --> 02:14:07,336
"Unless you buy it..."

1553
02:14:08,336 --> 02:14:13,128
"If you have intention of sharing...
Anything is good."

1554
02:14:13,253 --> 02:14:16,919
"Every day is a celebration."

1555
02:14:23,253 --> 02:14:28,753
"Those lessons,
motherís love are celebrations!"

1556
02:14:30,961 --> 02:14:37,169
"If humanity is the truth, be truthful,
thatís a celebration.."

1557
02:14:38,991 --> 02:14:42,967
When I said that I like the life
you led with my father.

1558
02:14:44,199 --> 02:14:45,279
It remained a dream.

1559
02:14:47,013 --> 02:14:48,858
When I said it was very easy
to convince my uncle...

1560
02:14:50,513 --> 02:14:51,677
It was left as a word to me.

1561
02:14:53,638 --> 02:14:56,284
When old man said search till you understand
not till you get tired,

1562
02:14:57,676 --> 02:14:59,162
I wondered whatís there to understand...

1563
02:15:01,122 --> 02:15:04,525
My father used to write a diary...

1564
02:15:06,093 --> 02:15:07,812
Even he didnít understand life I guess...

1565
02:15:09,725 --> 02:15:10,912
But heís a great guy...

1566
02:15:11,929 --> 02:15:13,546
Did I ever had any problem?

1567
02:15:14,888 --> 02:15:16,906
Or did he ever make me realise that itís a problem?

1568
02:15:20,388 --> 02:15:23,625
You always keep talking,
right? Say something...

1569
02:15:24,513 --> 02:15:25,733
Iím having an unusual feeling about this...

1570
02:15:30,513 --> 02:15:31,254
Brother-in-law...

1571
02:15:32,263 --> 02:15:32,853
Brother-in-law...

1572
02:15:34,763 --> 02:15:36,628
Don't open your eyes. Keep them shut...

1573
02:15:36,929 --> 02:15:38,405
I canít say a thing otherwise...

1574
02:15:40,846 --> 02:15:45,144
Itís not always about witnessing
but also about performing sometimes...

1575
02:15:45,471 --> 02:15:48,665
You know what I was watching?
Today is my wedding arrangement day...

1576
02:15:49,638 --> 02:15:53,714
Theyíve arranged it right here.
And only because my father is mad at you...

1577
02:15:54,513 --> 02:15:55,893
Only a meeting, he said...

1578
02:15:57,054 --> 02:16:00,064
Donít look at me like that...
I canít say it if you look at me like that...

1579
02:16:17,180 --> 02:16:21,077
We met the London girl downstairs...
She told that you are here.

1580
02:16:21,322 --> 02:16:23,402
This is not match which she has to face.

1581
02:16:24,231 --> 02:16:27,036
How ever it may come,
four members are there right?

1582
02:16:27,195 --> 02:16:28,664
So that we all together came.

1583
02:16:33,216 --> 02:16:36,532
I came here to see you. After this...

1584
02:16:38,020 --> 02:16:42,821
I donít understand when people preach...
and I end up provoking them...

1585
02:16:44,141 --> 02:16:45,809
I am saying all this because...

1586
02:16:47,562 --> 02:16:49,052
That boy doesnít like my daughter...

1587
02:16:49,932 --> 02:16:51,668
And I donít like the guy I finalised.

1588
02:16:52,227 --> 02:16:58,420
Just when I decided to
let go off everything and go to him.

1589
02:16:58,521 --> 02:16:59,151
I begin to dislike you...

1590
02:16:59,323 --> 02:17:01,177
Have some tea...
I'm telling you about my feeling...

1591
02:17:03,972 --> 02:17:05,772
The guy you are going to marry is
unreasonably wealthy...

1592
02:17:06,645 --> 02:17:08,096
Not talking about the numbers...

1593
02:17:10,064 --> 02:17:12,601
I am making the entire village dance
and they are making me dance...

1594
02:17:13,679 --> 02:17:17,972
If that guy doesnít accept,
Iíll go my nephew and fall at his feet...

1595
02:17:18,304 --> 02:17:21,129
Iíll tell him a few things... It wonít go in vain..

1596
02:17:22,186 --> 02:17:24,585
Heís a nice guy, just like his father...
or maybe even better...

1597
02:17:27,554 --> 02:17:30,478
Iíd consider had he rejected when we met...

1598
02:17:30,909 --> 02:17:33,967
But he rejected even after split,
that means thereís something...

1599
02:17:36,054 --> 02:17:40,581
Girls these days donít stick
to one thing for too long...

1600
02:17:41,049 --> 02:17:43,170
Something will happen, something might happen...

1601
02:17:43,441 --> 02:17:48,480
Really? Are you there... something like that...

1602
02:18:10,108 --> 02:18:12,208
This happens if I stay away for two days?

1603
02:18:15,304 --> 02:18:17,105
The celebrations wouldnít stop if you say...

1604
02:18:21,170 --> 02:18:21,767
Shall I go?

1605
02:18:24,743 --> 02:18:25,946
I must go, right?

1606
02:18:28,873 --> 02:18:30,693
You never let me see anything...

1607
02:18:36,134 --> 02:18:37,579
Donít look at me like that...

1608
02:18:57,710 --> 02:18:58,737
You guys have split...

1609
02:19:01,013 --> 02:19:01,896
But not the distance...

1610
02:19:29,275 --> 02:19:32,725
Ha ha ha...
He thought to paint brother but it is viceversa.

1611
02:19:34,494 --> 02:19:37,278
He choose good match..
as he didn't have good character.

1612
02:19:37,370 --> 02:19:38,900
Hey he might listen.
- He could not understand.

1613
02:19:50,337 --> 02:19:51,064
Come.. come..

1614
02:19:59,096 --> 02:20:00,914
Elder son will make an announcement
in the village...

1615
02:20:01,304 --> 02:20:03,931
Or maybe to make us listen
to what the village has to say..

1616
02:20:04,031 --> 02:20:05,214
Whatís with his hullabaloo...

1617
02:20:05,804 --> 02:20:07,478
Where have these guys come from?

1618
02:20:07,846 --> 02:20:12,505
They arenít doing any work...
Theyíd know if I compare my son with him.

1619
02:20:27,971 --> 02:20:29,421
Everyoneís at the wedding...

1620
02:20:30,554 --> 02:20:31,756
Itís just us, alone.

1621
02:20:33,304 --> 02:20:34,716
But father has his word, right?

1622
02:20:35,804 --> 02:20:36,505
Thatís enough...

1623
02:20:37,704 --> 02:20:38,360
Mother...

1624
02:20:39,471 --> 02:20:40,223
Letís go to the wedding...

1625
02:20:41,346 --> 02:20:43,484
What are you saying?
You are coming and we are going. That's it.

1626
02:21:56,096 --> 02:21:59,703
Canít be casual with him like before...
but I am unable to talk formally..

1627
02:21:59,903 --> 02:22:01,428
I feel weird with the idea of
talking to him formally.

1628
02:22:02,900 --> 02:22:06,591
You were very straight forward...
What are you whispering there?

1629
02:22:07,054 --> 02:22:08,587
Towards the end everything is well...

1630
02:22:09,199 --> 02:22:12,797
Must offer the cheek for a slap..
but... I never knew these tricks...

1631
02:22:13,557 --> 02:22:16,909
You came along very well...
This wedding... These calculations...

1632
02:22:23,596 --> 02:22:26,179
Everyone is amazed with the arrangements...

1633
02:22:39,694 --> 02:22:41,600
Hey Radha... Sister...

1634
02:22:50,221 --> 02:22:50,741
Son.

1635
02:22:54,846 --> 02:22:57,696
Whose wedding it is...
We are here because you invited...

1636
02:23:09,087 --> 02:23:10,164
Come here.

1637
02:23:14,629 --> 02:23:15,161
Come...

1638
02:23:20,304 --> 02:23:20,985
Oh...
- Hey!

1639
02:23:22,929 --> 02:23:23,575
Come here...

1640
02:23:24,513 --> 02:23:26,010
Brother, did you call me?

1641
02:23:26,513 --> 02:23:29,474
You said we would directionless
without our brother-in-law, right?

1642
02:23:29,674 --> 02:23:30,614
How did we manage all this?

1643
02:23:34,013 --> 02:23:36,669
Relatives from all over...are here...

1644
02:23:37,221 --> 02:23:37,830
Who?

1645
02:23:38,721 --> 02:23:39,654
Have they come dolled up for me?

1646
02:23:41,596 --> 02:23:42,564
Or my brother-in-law...

1647
02:23:44,179 --> 02:23:45,657
Do you think it's about attending the wedding?

1648
02:23:49,013 --> 02:23:50,132
Why arenít you coming?

1649
02:23:50,659 --> 02:23:52,985
Iíve been noticing you...
Why are you behaving like this?

1650
02:23:53,679 --> 02:23:55,956
We are here only because of him...

1651
02:23:56,179 --> 02:24:01,225
Will you admit in front of everyone
that this is your brother-in-lawís?

1652
02:24:01,679 --> 02:24:02,487
He can do that...

1653
02:24:03,138 --> 02:24:04,844
He came without me inviting...

1654
02:24:05,763 --> 02:24:10,281
To be the bigger person heíd bow
and admit that all this is this uncleís...

1655
02:24:10,673 --> 02:24:13,239
Can you? No... Because you are a coward!

1656
02:24:16,179 --> 02:24:17,509
Why must anyone bow their head, aunt?

1657
02:24:19,263 --> 02:24:20,493
Did anyone ask 30 years ago?

1658
02:24:21,929 --> 02:24:22,619
Was anyone there at all?

1659
02:24:25,554 --> 02:24:28,614
Uncle is like father, right? He took care of all...

1660
02:24:30,971 --> 02:24:34,125
When I was young...
they used to ride me on the cycle.

1661
02:24:34,981 --> 02:24:38,788
I never realised that it was dark...

1662
02:24:40,066 --> 02:24:41,356
I lost all fears and worries...

1663
02:24:42,929 --> 02:24:44,601
I stopped thinking...

1664
02:24:46,054 --> 02:24:47,927
They must have seen a lot ever since...

1665
02:24:49,971 --> 02:24:51,189
When anyone had any problem...

1666
02:24:52,263 --> 02:24:58,279
My father tried to divert them by involving
them in celebrations and festivities...

1667
02:25:00,060 --> 02:25:03,920
Never wondered the reasons
for all the dancing and grooving...

1668
02:25:05,054 --> 02:25:05,838
Probably father knew that...

1669
02:25:06,929 --> 02:25:09,857
If we acted innocent at such times,
Almighty would do the needful...

1670
02:25:11,221 --> 02:25:13,119
So, letís just be innocent, uncle...

1671
02:25:14,221 --> 02:25:15,484
Why do we need such smartness?

1672
02:25:17,513 --> 02:25:21,617
When my father said...
he wanted his people, I never understood...

1673
02:25:22,596 --> 02:25:26,881
When you guys fought and he said not to take sides,

1674
02:25:27,638 --> 02:25:28,794
I didnít understand...

1675
02:25:29,804 --> 02:25:31,539
When I went away from everything, I understood.

1676
02:25:33,388 --> 02:25:34,703
Thereís a father in everyone...

1677
02:25:35,888 --> 02:25:36,914
And you in everyone here...

1678
02:25:38,804 --> 02:25:40,113
Thereís honesty in everyone...

1679
02:25:41,388 --> 02:25:44,881
Thereís anger and a fear...

1680
02:25:45,846 --> 02:25:46,937
The same kind of goodness...

1681
02:25:48,388 --> 02:25:49,393
The craving of togetherness...

1682
02:25:50,596 --> 02:25:51,454
And saying no to it..

1683
02:25:55,013 --> 02:25:55,804
I understood then...

1684
02:25:57,263 --> 02:25:58,967
All of these are just questions...

1685
02:26:02,513 --> 02:26:06,346
How much can we play with our unstable heart?

1686
02:26:07,471 --> 02:26:08,546
How much can it take...

1687
02:26:08,888 --> 02:26:12,589
And thatís exactly why my father
always wanted people around him...

1688
02:26:15,013 --> 02:26:16,564
When I went seven generations back...

1689
02:26:17,596 --> 02:26:19,734
Even if I donít have any bond them
they become dear to me...

1690
02:26:20,721 --> 02:26:23,241
If I had patiently gone 14 generations back...

1691
02:26:24,304 --> 02:26:27,847
Weíd figure out that everyone is related somehow..

1692
02:26:31,554 --> 02:26:33,642
Just because we found them all doesnít mean
that I donít need you, uncle..

1693
02:26:35,388 --> 02:26:37,801
Not my father... I need people now...

1694
02:26:38,721 --> 02:26:40,675
I am like this only because of yíall.

1695
02:26:43,054 --> 02:26:45,525
When did you tell me uncle...
thereís something called worry.

1696
02:26:46,554 --> 02:26:47,798
I donít want that for my kids...

1697
02:26:48,846 --> 02:26:49,873
And their next generation...

1698
02:26:55,971 --> 02:26:57,400
Uncle, in your big world.

1699
02:26:59,096 --> 02:27:00,842
The happiness you share with your brothers...

1700
02:27:02,929 --> 02:27:04,558
Can I and my mother be a small part of it?

1701
02:27:08,721 --> 02:27:09,958
Can mother and I live with you?

1702
02:27:14,679 --> 02:27:15,368
Tell me, uncle..

1703
02:27:16,804 --> 02:27:17,757
Can we?

1704
02:27:24,513 --> 02:27:25,640
Shall we or no?

1705
02:27:27,138 --> 02:27:27,464
Tell me...

1706
02:27:28,388 --> 02:27:29,260
Yes or no?

1707
02:27:57,388 --> 02:28:00,454
We just split... we didnít move away..

1708
02:28:11,429 --> 02:28:16,897
After my death, this property
would go to my older brother-in-law...

1709
02:28:17,813 --> 02:28:22,529
Because he was by my side in good,
bad and ugly...

1710
02:28:27,179 --> 02:28:32,057
Wondered why I have been so selfish
with crores of property and money...

1711
02:28:33,993 --> 02:28:34,850
But...

1712
02:28:35,584 --> 02:28:40,419
When he decided to give you all his assets,
I thought is that all I could do.

1713
02:28:40,835 --> 02:28:43,429
Can we give away anything without thinking?

1714
02:28:44,084 --> 02:28:46,743
I thought unbelievable truths are just lies...

1715
02:28:47,366 --> 02:28:50,780
But I realised they are magic only after I met him..

1716
02:29:12,846 --> 02:29:13,518
Once...

1717
02:29:14,831 --> 02:29:18,786
The thought of selling away
the factory was not real...

1718
02:29:20,090 --> 02:29:25,735
Had your father agreed to it by mistake...
Your fatherís name would not have been there, right?

1719
02:29:27,387 --> 02:29:28,828
I just thought about that...

1720
02:29:31,304 --> 02:29:34,004
Some unusual thoughts...

1721
02:29:35,127 --> 02:29:40,098
Every time I got them
you and your father took me to the crowds..

1722
02:29:42,630 --> 02:29:44,438
But those moments were amazing...

1723
02:29:46,498 --> 02:29:51,064
If those moments were amazing
how the whole life would be...

1724
02:29:52,212 --> 02:29:57,157
Had I realised it back them,
we wouldnít have been here today.

1725
02:29:57,988 --> 02:30:01,330
I think your great-grand-father
might have had a bad one like me...

1726
02:30:03,733 --> 02:30:07,217
A slight lesser bad guy
with your grand father...

1727
02:30:08,358 --> 02:30:11,988
And me with your father...

1728
02:30:14,096 --> 02:30:15,898
All that badness is gone henceforth...

1729
02:30:20,429 --> 02:30:21,521
Its over.

1730
02:30:23,346 --> 02:30:25,313
Your fatherís Lord Rama!

1731
02:30:25,513 --> 02:30:30,262
I donít know if I am Lord hanuman...
but your father is Lord Rama forever!

1732
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:32,163
You said youíll come after the wedding...

1733
02:31:32,263 --> 02:31:34,062
You never came... What happened?

1734
02:31:42,899 --> 02:31:43,704
He is coming.
