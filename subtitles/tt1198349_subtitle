Put a card.

Who mixed liquor in water?

40
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:12,013
You guys piss in your
pants on hearing his name.

41
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:14,880

00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:23,375
You're the best.
- Subbalakshmi...

73
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:27,815
Subbalakshmi is missing.

74
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:06,451
Subbalakshmi eloped with labourer
Subba Rao's son Erra Babu.

75
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:14,626
l beg you...

76

How could we cheat you?

You've been with Erra Babu
since morning.

84
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,116
Now you say that you don't
know anything about him.

85
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:41,860
We thought he has come to
attend the marriage.

86
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:44,120
But we never thought
he would do this.

87
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:46,355
We really don't know
where Erra Babu is.

88
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:55,908
Oh my God!
l will die if you hit me.

110
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:07,639
l haven't give the letter yet.

111
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:08,778
Where is Subbalakshmi?

112
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:09,948
How would l know?
- Go.

113
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:11,309
Where are Subbalakshmi & Babu?

114

Who are they?

115
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:15,118
Who are you guys?
l know nothing.

116
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:17,016
Put him in the car.

117
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:21,455
Hyderabad

118
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:24,296
That's his house.

119
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:26,326
Go & inquire about him.

120
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:30,465
Who is that?

121
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:33,071
ls Krishna at home?
- No.

122
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:36,173
But his mother Yeshoda is at home.

123
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:37,239
When will he come?

124
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:39,070
Can you tell me when will he
get hair on his bald head?

125
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:40,108
He too is like that.

126
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,144
Doesn't he live here?

127
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:44,009

00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:45,911
Can you find fire in fire engine?

129
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:47,608
Similarly. he will not be
available at his home.

130
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,479
Why?

131
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:52,588
His father worked in Railways.
Now he is no more.

132
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:55,522
He was born in a running train.
That's why he keeps running.

133
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,628

134
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:00,797

with a stronger chain.

137
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:04,959
Let me see what he will do.

138
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:08,004
Don't tell him that l know
about his smoking habit.

139
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:09,697
He will come up with new lies.

140
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:11,206
We are here on an urgent matter.

141
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:12,434
lf you could tell us
where he is...

142
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:14,044
How would l know that?

143
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:16,180
He goes to many places everyday.

144
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:18,009
He was born with wheels
under his butt.

145
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:30,819
SRI BALAJI

Staying put like a rock

00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:21,999
Change places every second.
and you will find happiness...

160
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:45,954


161
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:31,535
Sun rests at night and
the moon sleeps after dawn...

162
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:35,145
My body will never
tire in this birth...

163
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:38,714
l'll keep surging high...

164
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:45,983
Find the meaning of victory
and defeat tomorrow...

165
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:53,325

Get up.

167
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:56,886
Are you Krishna?

168
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:58,654
Do you have to surround to ask this?

169
00:14:58,864 --> 00:15:01,628
Where are Subbalakshmi & Babu?

170
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:04,466
l don't know who Subbalakshmi is.

171
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,570
How will l know about her father?

172
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:08,467
Trying to fool us.

173
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:11,040
Didn't you & Babu study
together in Warangal?

174
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:14,579
He eloped with our girl.
- You mean Erra Babu?

175
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:16,276

00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:32,526
He has eloped with a girl.

181
00:15:34,366 --> 00:15:36,527
l'm giving the party.
- And Vijay?

182
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:37,895
l will inform him too.

183
00:15:39,905 --> 00:15:41,236
Why did you throw the phone?

184
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:45,139
My mother bought this for me
after begging her for 3 days.

185
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:48,707
Catch him.

186
00:15:56,555 --> 00:15:57,954
You bald headed!

187
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:01,088
You are going overboard.
- Stop it.

188
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:02,789
Will you buy that for me?

189
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:16,164


190
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:18,776
Get up.

191
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:19,834
Where is Babu?

192
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:22,980
He lives in Ramachandrapuram.
Go there & inquire.

193
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:24,308
You are here.

194
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:29,412
Oh my God!

195
00:16:29,855 --> 00:16:31,880
You took me across
districts in one night.

196
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:33,558
Come out.

197
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:37,154
He is talking too much.
He is making fun of us.

198
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:38,990
l was hit hard at night.

199
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:41,556
Are you playing fool with us?

200
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:44,497
Where is the girl?
Tell us.

201
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:49,533
What's your problem?
What are you talking about?

202
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:52,870
Where have you hidden them?
- What do you want?

203
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:56,610
How dare you hit me?
You are going overboard.

204
00:17:02,454 --> 00:17:04,354
Everyone here will question you.

205
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:05,955
All of them are my relatives.

206
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:08,753
You just answer their questions.

207
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:12,726
Ask me...go ahead.

208
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:14,258
l don't know.

209
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,465
l will kill you...
- What?

210
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:18,499
Youngsters falling in love
is common.

211
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,569
Elders standing against
their love is also common.

212
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:22,570
Some get separated.

213
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:24,470
Youngsters whose love
is strong. elope.

214
00:17:24,676 --> 00:17:25,870
These are very common.

215
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:28,171
Why do you guys create
so much mayhem?

216
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:31,708
How dare you say that?

217
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:32,906
Even yesterday he behaved like this.

218
00:17:33,118 --> 00:17:34,346
When we inquired about
your daughter.

219
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:36,783
he phoned his friends to have
a party and made fun of us.

220
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:39,923
l hit him on head and
brought him here.

221
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:46,925
You said you wanted to call.
Make the call now.

222
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:49,225
Now. it is not about that.
We can have all this later.

223
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:50,902
All you want is your girl. right?

224
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,162
lf Babu contacts me.
l will inform you.

225
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:54,805
Give me your cell phone numbers.

226
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:56,668
You must be having
landline numbers atleast.

227
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,308
Trying to fools us?

228
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:03,713
Until l find my daughter.
you won't leave this village.

229
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:13,590
l'm caught here because of ill fate.
- You have grown too fat.

230
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:15,453
lt's been very long
since l saw you.

231
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:17,128
l will kick you guys.

232
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:19,024
Who told them my name in
which l'm no way involved into?

233
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:20,858
He...
- He said.

234
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:25,965
He is getting too emotional.
- Whom are you talking about?

235
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:28,002
The girl's daughter.

236
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:32,574
lf anyone hears you talking
like this about him.

237
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:33,574
they will kill you.

238
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:37,146
Neelakantam is the big shot
in this village.

239
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:39,249
People are even scared to
look at his daughters.

240
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:41,351
But our boy eloped with
his daughter.

241
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:42,747
lf they get him.
they will kill him.

242
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,183
We won't even find his dead body.

243
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:45,918
ls she beautiful?

244
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:51,287
All this will last for only 2 months.

245
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:52,691
May be 3 months maximum.

246
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:54,422
After that. everyone will forget her.

247
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,191
lf she gives birth to a child.

248
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:58,266
these people will go to
her with fruits & sweets.

249
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,438
lt's we who will become fools.

250
00:19:02,374 --> 00:19:03,238
Who is he?

251
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,111
Thank God. you wanted
to know about me.

252
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:07,710
l'm P. Yagna Narayana Sharma.

253
00:19:08,046 --> 00:19:09,877
They brought me here by mistake.

254
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:12,983
l know nothing about this village
or about their problems.

255
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:15,081
l've been trying to tell
this from morning.

256
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:16,345
But they hit me on my mouth
when l try to tell them.

257
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:17,749
Look Yaggu...

258
00:19:18,223 --> 00:19:20,453
We will call you like that.
Do you mind?

259
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:24,186
Call me Yag or a pig
or anything you want.

260
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:27,194
But tell me how to
get out of this village.

261
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:32,298
How can we go to
Hyderabad from here?

262
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:34,638
There is a train at 5:30 am.
- Why?

263
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:36,769
l'm going to escape.
- Escape.

264
00:19:36,975 --> 00:19:39,466
Aren't you coming with me?
- No.

265
00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:09,470
ls there a reason for us to
come to this village again?

266
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:11,404
Notjust you. even our bond
with this village is over.

267
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:13,601
l've a score to settle.

268
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:16,239
ls it necessary to be
so honest at this hour?

269
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:20,783
Who is that?

270
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:27,926
who is that?

271
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:30,625
Run...
We are dead.

272
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:35,592
lf l find Babu.

273
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:37,428
l'll kill him before they could.

274
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,766
Slowly. l can't...

275
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:46,103
Stop...

276
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:48,271
Come here...

277
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,811
Come carefully...

278
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:55,019
Hey. they are trying to escape.

279
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:58,116
They must somewhere around here.

Find them.
Look there.

281
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:06,421
What is our position?
Will we get caught?

282
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:14,904
Go there.

283
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:23,877
Over there.

284
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:34,482

00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:38,155
They are trying to kill me.

They are beating him.

Oh god l am caught.

You guys shitting at the same place.
Don't you have toilets at home?

00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:21,231
Wash your hands and
then hit me.

293
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:27,135
Run...

00:22:43,962 --> 00:22:46,863

Search everywhere.
Don't lose them.

297
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:53,628
Go & find them.

298
00:24:07,512 --> 00:24:09,480
Train is coming.
Come fast.

299
00:24:18,523 --> 00:24:21,822
Train is leaving.
Come fast.

300
00:24:22,027 --> 00:24:26,657
Where is he?
Hey Krishna...

301
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:29,026
Train is leaving...
Come fast.

302
00:24:35,707 --> 00:24:37,038
Why aren't you coming?

303
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:38,038
Why are you standing like a rock?

304
00:24:38,243 --> 00:24:39,335
The train is leaving. Come.

305
00:24:57,762 --> 00:24:59,753
What is our position now?

306
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:11,835
l beg you.
Don't harm us.

307
00:25:12,043 --> 00:25:12,839
You said you're not involved in it.

308
00:25:13,044 --> 00:25:14,272
Then why did you try to escape?

309
00:25:14,479 --> 00:25:16,276
We are really not involved in it.

310
00:25:16,481 --> 00:25:19,314
We tried to flee fearing that
you might kill us all.- Yes...

311
00:25:19,751 --> 00:25:29,717
SRI BALAJI

312
00:25:33,098 --> 00:25:34,793
lt's been 22 years
since l got angry.

313
00:25:36,067 --> 00:25:37,591
Don't even dare to see my anger.

314
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:41,038
ls escaping an ordinary matter?
No.

315
00:25:41,406 --> 00:25:42,873
lf l know that you're not
involved in it.

316
00:25:43,074 --> 00:25:44,632
l will send you home.

317
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:45,706
But if anyone tries to
escape from here...

318
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:48,004
l won't leave this village
until l find the girl.

319
00:25:48,947 --> 00:25:50,380
Not even if you
tell me to leave.

320
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:55,547
Yes brother.

321
00:25:56,588 --> 00:25:57,782
Put them in that shed.

322
00:25:57,989 --> 00:25:59,684
Go.
- Go.

323
00:26:06,598 --> 00:26:07,826
l'm not involved in it.
l won't come.

324
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:09,762
He is not involved in it.
- Get inside.

325
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:19,276
You didn't get Babu's friend
Palakollu Pandu. did you?

326
00:26:19,477 --> 00:26:20,569
Do you know where he is?

327
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:21,803
He lives in Palakollu.

328
00:26:22,013 --> 00:26:23,571
We can find him if
we search thoroughly.

329
00:26:24,482 --> 00:26:26,473
Prasad. take him with you.

330
00:26:28,887 --> 00:26:32,050
Erra Babu's close friend is in Dubai.

331
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,754
lf he does anything silly.

332
00:26:37,963 --> 00:26:41,023
lf they do anything silly.

333
00:26:41,232 --> 00:26:42,961
Uncle...
- Yes.

334
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:45,864
They shouldn't escape.
- l will take care of that.

335
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:50,132
Don't try to jump over the walls.
They will beat me to pulp.

336
00:26:53,211 --> 00:26:54,508
That fat fellow has escaped.

337
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,411
Would they believed me
if l had said Amalapuram?

338
00:26:57,649 --> 00:26:58,274
Junk brain.

339
00:26:58,483 --> 00:27:01,611
lt is very calm over here.

340
00:27:02,354 --> 00:27:04,754
We should've been in home.
But we are now in a shed.

341
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:06,753
l've no patience to argue with you.

342
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:08,220
The train was very near.

343
00:27:08,426 --> 00:27:09,825
A 10 minute journey would've
taken us to Rajahmundry.

344
00:27:10,028 --> 00:27:11,757
We must have been
eating hot idlies by now.

345
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:14,295
Why did you stop all of a sudden?

346
00:27:14,532 --> 00:27:16,397
l saw a beautiful girl.

347
00:27:17,502 --> 00:27:18,969
l forgot to move.

348
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:22,568
l like her very much.
- What is he talking?

349
00:27:22,774 --> 00:27:23,968
Are you in senses or not?

350
00:27:24,175 --> 00:27:25,972
Do you know why they
brought us here?

351
00:27:26,177 --> 00:27:27,405
Do you know why they
are beating us?

352
00:27:27,612 --> 00:27:29,307
Do you know why we are here?

353
00:27:29,514 --> 00:27:31,345
Till now. l didn't know the reason.

354
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:34,577
But now l know why l should
stay here.- You mean...?

355
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,452
Look at me and say.

356
00:27:36,755 --> 00:27:37,585
l need to find that girl.

357
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:39,256
He will kill us all.
What happened?

358
00:27:39,457 --> 00:27:42,585
Who would they kill?
- You.

359
00:27:42,927 --> 00:27:43,586
You shut up.

360
00:27:43,795 --> 00:27:46,958
We must have met you and
Babu in an inauspicious hour.

361
00:27:47,565 --> 00:27:48,998
What's the matter?
- What is our position?

362
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:51,195
They will cut us into pieces
and soak us in chilies.

363
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:53,803
Oh my God!

364
00:27:56,307 --> 00:27:59,071
Who is that?
Must be some kind of a beating.

365
00:27:59,744 --> 00:28:01,735
There is a shed for
ladies over there.

366
00:28:01,946 --> 00:28:04,346
lf you open your mouth again.
l will slap you.

367
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:05,573
l'll hit you.

368
00:28:05,784 --> 00:28:08,184
Where did you go early morning?
- To temple.

369
00:28:08,386 --> 00:28:10,547
Enough of prayers
offered by your sister.

370
00:28:10,755 --> 00:28:13,918
lf you go out.
l will break your legs.

371
00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:15,289
What about college?

372
00:28:15,493 --> 00:28:18,121
Whose poetry do you want to read?
- Me?

373
00:28:18,329 --> 00:28:22,857
We got everything you wanted
and took good care of you.

374
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:24,057
But finally humiliated us.

375
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:26,203
lt's been 2 days since he ate.

376
00:28:26,504 --> 00:28:30,031
How could you cheat him?
- Me?

377
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:33,404
l knew she would
ditch us all one day.

378
00:28:33,611 --> 00:28:37,069
ln our days. we never lifted our heads
and we still continue that.

379
00:28:37,282 --> 00:28:40,513
Our children neither talk against us
nor eloped with someone.

380
00:28:43,421 --> 00:28:46,618
Got any news about them or
have you returned empty handed?

381
00:28:46,825 --> 00:28:47,587
We could not find them.

382
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:52,590
You make me remember
the temple bell.

383
00:28:52,997 --> 00:28:55,557
People who come to offer prayer.
ring the bell.

384
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:58,429
Similarly. when they talk about
your sister. you get the beating.

385
00:28:58,636 --> 00:29:00,501
You wouldn't have gone
to temple for nothing.

386
00:29:00,705 --> 00:29:02,172
You would want your sister
to live happily.

387
00:29:02,373 --> 00:29:04,637
Why would l?
Rascal.

388
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:06,743
She fell in love & eloped.
ls that all?

389
00:29:06,945 --> 00:29:11,905
She never worried about
her sister or her future.

390
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:14,017
That's why l wish her to get caught.

391
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:15,982
l don't care whether
they trust me or not.

392
00:29:16,187 --> 00:29:19,088
lt's enough if my father trusts me.
- l don't know.

393
00:29:19,824 --> 00:29:22,918
Talk to Chinnabbai.
- Okay.

394
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:35,904
Father. l was a small girl
to them till yesterday.

395
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:40,305
But now. everyone scolds me as
if l've done something wrong.

396
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:49,014
l know about my daughters.

397
00:29:49,888 --> 00:29:51,150
They won't cheat me.

398
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:53,755
lt's not your sister's fault.

399
00:29:55,393 --> 00:29:56,655
He tricked her.

400
00:29:56,861 --> 00:29:59,227
l won't fall to any tricks. father.

401
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:05,967
What has made you to stick
to that place?

402
00:30:06,171 --> 00:30:08,264
There are about 300 houses
in the place.

403
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:11,002
lt's not a big deal
to find the girl.

404
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:14,437
See left side. there's only
one burial ground for the village.

405
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:17,171
lf things go against. it's not
a great deal to cremate us.

406
00:30:17,382 --> 00:30:19,612
What are you saying?
- Not to you. l beg you.

407
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,809
What's this noise?
- We're innocent. don't know anything.

408
00:30:28,726 --> 00:30:30,523
Madam! Why are you rushing in?

409
00:30:30,728 --> 00:30:31,695
Do you know who they are?

410
00:30:31,896 --> 00:30:34,831
They are young men. look into their eyes.
they'll make you fall for them.

411
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:37,763
Your sister fell for such a man
without knowing this.

412
00:30:39,571 --> 00:30:42,472
Men did their duty.
now it's time of their women.

413
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:45,837
Till now my daughter
told me everything.

414
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:49,908
she hid this from me
fearing unknown.

415
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:54,311
lf you're scared of telling my husband.
you can tell me. where's she?

416
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,316
l'll see that your names
are not revealed.

00:30:56,521 --> 00:31:00,116
Would anyone tell if you
make a plea. mother?

418
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,829
There's nothing to fear.
had we knew we would've told.

419
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:06,724
Trust me. we don't know anything.

420
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:21,110
Come...come. let's go.
- l'll ask them.

421
00:31:21,312 --> 00:31:23,280
You come.
- You go.

422
00:31:23,781 --> 00:31:24,611
As you wish.

Coming madam.

Excuse me.
- Who is it?

425
00:31:36,961 --> 00:31:38,861
My mother is very innocent.

426
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:40,997
Can you please tell me.
where is my sister?

427
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:44,759

430
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:53,908
l think she would've eloped
unable to bear this family's torture.

431
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:55,909
Don't get irritated.
- lrritated?

432
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:57,547
Show your face and talk.

433
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:01,412
Oh no! You're men. you'll make me
fall for you if l look into your eyes.

434
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:04,213
That's why. are you showing
your navel to trap me?

435
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,221
Oh God!

436
00:32:08,493 --> 00:32:09,721

You chase till you find them.

you know what they will
do on finding them. right?

440
00:32:15,033 --> 00:32:17,001
They committed a mistake.
they will undergo punishment.

441
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:20,102
Bad people get punished. right?
- Really?

442
00:32:20,471 --> 00:32:22,302
Who are good people then?
- Me!

443
00:32:23,007 --> 00:32:24,565
Who else?
- My father!

There's another one too.

00:32:29,881 --> 00:32:32,145
Then. you would understand
my sorrow easily.

There's not much difference between
you inside and me outside.

00:32:36,988 --> 00:32:39,855
People are chiding me
as if l had done the mistake.

l'll be safe and you'll be freed.

00:37:27,845 --> 00:37:30,109
Quiet please sir...
please don't shout sir.

525
00:37:30,314 --> 00:37:32,646
l beg you sir.
- Show your face while talking.

526
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:33,976
You're showing something else.

527
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:35,483
Bloody!

528
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:36,777
What shall we do now sir?

529
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:38,717
What else is there to do?
Wear your shoes.- Can we go home?

530
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:41,721
We can go home.- What about me?
- You also wear clothes.

531
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:46,191
What is your name?
- Meena.

532
00:37:46,397 --> 00:37:49,332
ls your father at home?
- Why?

533
00:37:49,533 --> 00:37:51,433
Call him. l need to talk to him.

534
00:37:51,636 --> 00:37:55,231
Talk to me.
it's like talking to my father.

535
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:57,270
Why are you still talking to her?
Come. let's go to meet Neelakantam.

536
00:37:57,475 --> 00:37:59,306
Wait. am l not talking to her?

537
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:02,911
Please return the papers.
- Papers?

538
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,082
l think they are known
as love letters.

539
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:07,808
Love letters?

540
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:11,682
lt seems your handwriting
is very good.

541
00:38:11,889 --> 00:38:12,856
How do you know it?

542
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:14,581
Not me. your brother-in-law knows it.

543
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:16,783
lt seems he used to send it
through your notebooks only.

544
00:38:16,994 --> 00:38:18,018
ls it?
- Yes.

545
00:38:18,229 --> 00:38:20,459
Look. it's written in this.

546
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:24,828
Please return it sir.

547
00:38:25,036 --> 00:38:27,197
lt seems you watched the
film 'Happy Days' happily.

548
00:38:27,405 --> 00:38:28,895
Who gave you the tickets?

549
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,104
Sister!
- My foot sister!

550
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,539
lt seems your brother-in-law
got them in black market.

551
00:38:35,179 --> 00:38:36,009
How do you know it?

552
00:38:36,213 --> 00:38:37,544
lt's written in this.

553
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:44,580
lt seems your favourite hero
is Pawan Kalyan.

554
00:38:45,189 --> 00:38:47,419
Sir. it written in this.

555
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:52,292
ls it written in it?
lt would be there.

556
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:58,093
You acted as a conduit between them
and got others warned and beaten up.

557
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:01,703
You're not an ordinary girl.
- Please don't say like that sir.

558
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:04,974
Sir? Just a while ago you
said something else.

559
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:07,041
Did l? l would've used.

560
00:39:07,244 --> 00:39:09,007
l was very proud then.

561
00:39:09,213 --> 00:39:13,547
Why are you talking to her?
Call her father first.

562
00:39:13,751 --> 00:39:17,209
Quieten please...
l'll do any help you ask.

563
00:39:17,421 --> 00:39:18,979
Who needs your lousy help?

564
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:23,149
Give that to me...
- You may not need her help but l need.

565
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:24,661
Bloody!

566
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:26,329
What's our position now?

567
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:29,192
You gave him the letters.
now stay put here only.

568
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,665
Will you help me now?
- l'll definitely help you.

569
00:39:33,237 --> 00:39:34,295
Will you find that girl for me?

570
00:39:34,505 --> 00:39:37,030
l don't have experience
in such things.

571
00:39:37,241 --> 00:39:39,709
No problem. you do now.
you'll gain experience.

572
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:41,878
Father will kill if he comes to know.

573
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:45,344
Enough of thinking about you
and your father.

574
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:49,084
Start thinking about me and my love.

575
00:39:49,987 --> 00:39:50,612
Okay?

576
00:39:55,126 --> 00:39:57,219
What? What are you thinking about?

577
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:00,693
l'm thinking about you only.

578
00:40:00,965 --> 00:40:02,933
Please tell me how would
madam look like.

579
00:40:04,635 --> 00:40:14,601
SRI BALAJI

580
00:40:28,692 --> 00:40:33,755
You may not believe me...
she's a beautiful princess...

581
00:40:33,964 --> 00:40:39,527
She came down to earth...
she bloomed right before me...

582
00:40:54,885 --> 00:41:04,954
That's all! My heart fell in love
with her head over heels...

583
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:10,290
The world asked why...

584
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:14,699
Right now here. she's with me...

585
00:41:14,905 --> 00:41:19,968
Trust me. she mesmerized me
with her eyes...

586
00:41:20,177 --> 00:41:25,171
Some spell kept me unmoved...

587
00:41:32,723 --> 00:41:42,689


588
00:42:07,925 --> 00:42:12,828
Smiles of arrows are piercing
into me...

589
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:17,997
Pink cheeks are spreading light...

590
00:42:18,435 --> 00:42:23,236
Eyes are tying me spellbound...

591
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:28,474
She's standing before me
like the rainbow...

592
00:42:28,913 --> 00:42:39,118
When l saw her elegance...
l stood still like a rock...

593
00:42:39,323 --> 00:42:43,817
l asked my feet to move.
but they refused. you know that...

594
00:42:47,798 --> 00:42:57,764


595
00:43:47,224 --> 00:43:52,025
At dawn. sky came down to her...

596
00:43:52,496 --> 00:43:57,229
Sought the colour of her lips
atleast for a moment...

597
00:43:57,635 --> 00:44:02,334
Summer made a plea
to her feeling cold...

598
00:44:02,873 --> 00:44:07,572
Settled with pitiable face
in her breath...

599
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:13,139
All that beauty is mine...

600
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:18,378
lf so then 100 years of
happy life is mine...

601
00:44:18,589 --> 00:44:20,989
My heart can't take on the attacks
of dreams any more...

602
00:44:21,191 --> 00:44:22,988
Please find my love...

603
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:56,083
Brother-in-law. we inquired every
relative of Babu living around.

604
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,794
Everyone say. he didn't come there.

605
00:44:58,996 --> 00:45:01,897
Chanti called up.
Nellore Seenu hasn't turned up yet.

606
00:45:02,099 --> 00:45:06,001
Brother. Sl is here. he promises to
take care if we lodge a complaint.

607
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:07,397
Are you mad?

608
00:45:08,672 --> 00:45:10,606
She's my daughter.
she'll be embarrassed.

609
00:45:11,175 --> 00:45:12,665
No need of that.

610
00:45:13,177 --> 00:45:13,802
Your phone call.

611
00:45:14,011 --> 00:45:17,208
Lawyer. but tell him not to
give up searching.

612
00:45:17,848 --> 00:45:19,975
tell him to do whatever he can
without a formal complaint.

613
00:45:20,184 --> 00:45:22,778
l want my daughter back. that's all.
- l want that bastard too!

614
00:45:24,521 --> 00:45:27,081
He made a mistake of falling in love
knowing very well about us.

615
00:45:27,357 --> 00:45:31,657
lf l get hold of him. l'll see that nobody
would dare do it again here.

616
00:45:31,862 --> 00:45:33,329
Falling in love is sin.
isn't it father?

617
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:34,326
lsn't it a sin?

618
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:37,167
lsn't it a sin?

619
00:45:37,801 --> 00:45:38,825
Hey stop!

620
00:45:40,137 --> 00:45:40,967
What?

621
00:45:42,005 --> 00:45:42,767
Go inside.

622
00:45:46,844 --> 00:45:47,936
What are you doing there?

623
00:45:48,145 --> 00:45:50,613
l'll not leave any possible
way l get to find her.

624
00:45:50,814 --> 00:45:52,577
You've already put that
girl on it. right?

625
00:45:52,783 --> 00:45:53,511
What if l had?

626
00:45:53,717 --> 00:45:55,912
This is love matter.
we must keep trying from our side.

627
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:57,815
How am l to stop him?

628
00:45:58,021 --> 00:46:00,512
Do you love her so much?
- Hey. is he gone mad?

629
00:46:00,724 --> 00:46:03,420
We are worried about stopping him
and you're asking him about love.

630
00:46:04,962 --> 00:46:07,795
There's no size of love.
you love that's all.

631
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:09,922
if a need rises.
give your life for it. that's it!

632
00:46:10,467 --> 00:46:13,061
He's Lord Krishna and that guy's Arjuna.
he's giving a discourse on love.

633
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:16,034
He'll stay down only while
talking about love.

634
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,265
lf they talk about love and matter
gets leaked out. we are dead.

635
00:46:18,475 --> 00:46:20,272
ls it?
We don't know anything. it's not us.

636
00:46:20,477 --> 00:46:22,638
Come out.
- Who gets thrashing now?

637
00:46:24,648 --> 00:46:26,081
Look brother.
- l saw brother.

638
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:27,750
They are villagers.

639
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:32,786
with stubs and dirty faces.
tough guys without brains.

640
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:35,959
uneducated people.
but you are...

641
00:46:38,262 --> 00:46:41,595
Aren't you?
Why do you need all this trouble?

642
00:46:41,832 --> 00:46:42,594
Tell me.
- Please don't beat me.

643
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,791
ls he coming out?
- He's just shedding.

644
00:46:45,002 --> 00:46:47,994
Clothes?
- Matter.

645
00:46:48,238 --> 00:46:51,765
Look. if you open up
whatever you know.

646
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:54,773
l give guaranty that
nobody will dare touch you.

647
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:57,071
Nobody gave me this confidence till now.

648
00:46:57,281 --> 00:46:59,442
Okay brother.
- You're intelligent.

649
00:46:59,883 --> 00:47:01,748
You too... though not from city...

650
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:05,212
Aren't you? You too use it. brother.

651
00:47:05,422 --> 00:47:07,117
Bringing it madam.
- l did. so what?

652
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:12,853
lf Babu has useless friends like us.
Subbalakshmi would also have friends.

653
00:47:13,063 --> 00:47:15,395
There may be. what can they do?

654
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:16,998
They do everything.

655
00:47:17,901 --> 00:47:19,528
They have every piece of information.

656
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:23,002
Women are more dangerous than men.

657
00:47:23,207 --> 00:47:27,576
Like taking letters hiding in notebooks.
helping them financially.

658
00:47:27,778 --> 00:47:28,972
they do all this.

659
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:32,080
Once they elope...
- No. after missing...

660
00:47:32,282 --> 00:47:34,307
Okay after they go missing.

661
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:37,646
they burn the letters and go on working
as if nothing had happened.

662
00:47:38,455 --> 00:47:39,012
Coming madam.

663
00:47:39,223 --> 00:47:43,751
Brother. let's comb every home here
and ask every girl the village.

664
00:47:43,961 --> 00:47:47,021
The girl would be in
our hands by evening.

665
00:47:47,764 --> 00:47:50,198
His dirty idea is to find his girl.

666
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:53,901
Not a dirty idea. extraordinary idea.

667
00:47:55,339 --> 00:47:57,773
What? Did he say something?

668
00:47:57,975 --> 00:47:58,999
Sir is coming.

669
00:48:00,611 --> 00:48:02,670
He made an extraordinary suggestion.

670
00:48:03,914 --> 00:48:07,748
Like we asked these guys. how about
inquiring your daughter's friends?

671
00:48:11,088 --> 00:48:12,020
You be on it.

672
00:48:15,993 --> 00:48:19,429
Brother. bye.
Leave them and come with me.

673
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:21,720
He changed the path.

674
00:48:21,932 --> 00:48:23,058
They will search. let's go.

675
00:48:23,267 --> 00:48:28,102
Let's go into that dirty dungeon.
that's good for us. come.

676
00:48:28,305 --> 00:48:31,138
Lock them up.
- Come on boys.

677
00:48:31,341 --> 00:48:33,707
We'll go. we are not having
any fun locked up there.

678
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:35,936
We are also struggling to find her.

679
00:48:37,347 --> 00:48:38,871
Girls are very sentimental.

680
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:42,176
l thought of showing my wounds and
break them sentimentally to tell the truth.

681
00:48:42,386 --> 00:48:43,375
l don't think it's not
going to work out.

682
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:44,451
Come on boys. let's go.
brother. you carry on.

683
00:48:44,655 --> 00:48:48,989
As far as l know they wouldn't even open
the doors for tough guys like you.

684
00:48:49,192 --> 00:48:52,628
Unlike dealing with boys.
girls don't open up on asking.

685
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:53,627
You must beg them.
- Okay. go.

686
00:48:54,298 --> 00:48:55,492
Brother!

687
00:48:56,066 --> 00:48:57,465
Take them also with you.
- Okay.

688
00:48:57,935 --> 00:48:58,629
Come.

689
00:49:09,513 --> 00:49:10,480
He's going to drag us into trouble again.

690
00:49:10,681 --> 00:49:11,545
Not trouble but big trouble.

691
00:49:11,748 --> 00:49:16,014
Brother. notjust Subbalakshmi's friends.
let's meet every girl here.

692
00:49:16,219 --> 00:49:17,743
Meet?
- l mean ask them.

693
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:20,651
By evening..
- The girl would be in our hands.

694
00:49:21,425 --> 00:49:23,325
What brother? Shall we ask?

695
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:26,554
We must beg.

696
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:31,660
Further down.

697
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:35,271
Beggars don't have any time sense to beg.

698
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:35,938
What sir?

699
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:37,800
Aren't you Subbalakshmi's friend?

700
00:49:38,575 --> 00:49:39,473
You ask her.

701
00:49:40,444 --> 00:49:43,277
Do you've any habit of walking
in mist around the farm?

702
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:44,777
What are you asking?

703
00:49:45,048 --> 00:49:48,176
Brother. village love stories start
in misty farms only.

704
00:49:48,385 --> 00:49:50,250
ls it?
- Yes sir. it's our ill fate.

705
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:52,181
You carry on.
- l don't have such habits.

706
00:49:52,389 --> 00:49:53,947
Come. let's go. waste of time.

707
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:55,590
Subbalakshmi matter...?

708
00:49:55,792 --> 00:49:58,158
Brother. people not going out in mist
wouldn't be interested in love.

709
00:49:58,362 --> 00:49:59,226
l don't know sir.

710
00:49:59,429 --> 00:50:00,555
Do you go out in mist?

711
00:50:00,764 --> 00:50:02,698
l've Asthma. mist is allergy to me.

712
00:50:02,899 --> 00:50:03,957
Aunt!

713
00:50:04,201 --> 00:50:05,532
They don't go out in mist.

714
00:50:05,769 --> 00:50:06,736
Let's try here also.

715
00:50:06,937 --> 00:50:08,268
This is my home.

716
00:50:09,906 --> 00:50:11,567
You don't have any sisters. do you?

717
00:50:11,775 --> 00:50:13,709
No.
- Thank God!

718
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:16,708
l don't know sir. l don't go out.
- Okay. leave it.

719
00:50:18,248 --> 00:50:28,214
SRI BALAJI

720
00:50:33,764 --> 00:50:35,994
Aunt! How many daughters you've?

721
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:38,531
Three!
- Three?

722
00:50:38,735 --> 00:50:40,134
Please call one by one.
l would like to see them.

723
00:50:40,337 --> 00:50:42,498
They are in their ln-law's place.
shall l call them here?

724
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:45,766
ln-law's place?
- Brother. mist matter.

725
00:50:45,976 --> 00:50:47,705
What would married women
do in misty mornings?

726
00:50:47,911 --> 00:50:49,037
l don't know sir.

727
00:50:50,847 --> 00:50:53,873
lt isn't Subbalakshmi's fault.
- Stop your nonsense.

728
00:50:54,084 --> 00:50:55,847
Useless matter. let's go.

729
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:01,648
Babu used to chase her saying
he loves her and would die for her.

730
00:51:01,858 --> 00:51:05,419
lt isn't Subbalakshmi's fault.
Subbu is innocent.

731
00:51:05,629 --> 00:51:07,290
This is the last house.

732
00:51:07,497 --> 00:51:09,556
l wish we find here atleast.

733
00:51:11,334 --> 00:51:12,232
Take it.

734
00:51:12,869 --> 00:51:15,303
Do you go out in mist?
- l do sir.

735
00:51:16,339 --> 00:51:18,432
This girl goes out in mist.

736
00:51:19,376 --> 00:51:22,641
Don't feel sad for not finding the girl.

737
00:51:22,979 --> 00:51:25,004
But l did find a good younger brother.

738
00:51:27,818 --> 00:51:30,548
We have seen all the girls here.
it's very difficult to find her.

739
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:32,654
Let's go.
- lt's not difficult.

740
00:51:32,989 --> 00:51:35,651
Very easy. l've seen all the girls.

741
00:51:36,293 --> 00:51:38,955
Just one girl is there.
Who is she?

742
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:43,231
He's taking advantage of me
because the letters are with him.

743
00:51:43,567 --> 00:51:47,094
Once l get hold of the letters.
l'll take him to task.

744
00:51:47,404 --> 00:51:48,701
May be you're doing the wrong thing?

745
00:51:49,139 --> 00:51:51,607
lt's not wrong to do wrong
to escape from a wrong.

746
00:51:51,975 --> 00:51:54,205
You come.
- You go. l'll guard outside.

747
00:51:54,911 --> 00:51:56,105
Coward!

748
00:52:28,445 --> 00:52:30,879
Brother! Do you've a cigarette?

749
00:52:32,382 --> 00:52:33,076
Take it.

750
00:52:33,383 --> 00:52:35,248
Madam! They are coming back.

751
00:52:40,123 --> 00:52:42,387
l'm going! l'm gone!

752
00:52:45,962 --> 00:52:47,259
We searched almost every home.

753
00:52:48,398 --> 00:52:50,423
There's difference between all homes
and almost all homes.

754
00:52:50,634 --> 00:52:52,534
l'm sure l'll find her.

755
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:54,868
Go!

756
00:52:55,071 --> 00:52:56,504
Where the hell did he hide it?

757
00:53:08,051 --> 00:53:09,211
Open the door.

758
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:20,386


759
00:53:23,166 --> 00:53:24,758
Close the door.
- What's all this?

760
00:53:24,968 --> 00:53:28,062
You close the door sir.
- Did they beat up another group?

761
00:53:28,271 --> 00:53:29,966
Their will and wish to beat.
what can we do?

762
00:53:30,173 --> 00:53:31,435
Why is the room displaced?

763
00:53:31,641 --> 00:53:33,006
They would've beaten up someone.

764
00:53:35,178 --> 00:53:36,236
Keep it aside.

765
00:53:36,446 --> 00:53:39,813
Since morning searched yet...
what are you doing there?

766
00:53:41,084 --> 00:53:42,483
Clothes...
- Go inside.

767
00:53:42,686 --> 00:53:44,483
Okay.
- The girl's whereabouts are unknown.

768
00:53:50,961 --> 00:53:53,395
l know you are here only.
come out.

769
00:53:53,496 --> 00:53:54,827
Who is he calling?
- l told you to come here.

770
00:53:55,565 --> 00:53:56,327
Come.

771
00:54:03,139 --> 00:54:04,163
Did you search?

772
00:54:05,508 --> 00:54:06,406
Found it?

773
00:54:07,644 --> 00:54:09,703
l asked did you search for
the girl and found her?

774
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:13,576
l searched but didn't find.
- Don't tell lies.

775
00:54:16,119 --> 00:54:18,587
Do you know how many
houses are in this place?

776
00:54:19,823 --> 00:54:21,791
615!

777
00:54:22,726 --> 00:54:25,354
Do you know how many
unmarried girl are here?

778
00:54:26,796 --> 00:54:28,286
39!

779
00:54:29,399 --> 00:54:32,095
l got so much information
locked up here.

780
00:54:32,302 --> 00:54:36,170
lnstead of sitting at home and eating.
why don't you go out to find?

781
00:54:36,373 --> 00:54:39,342
My people warned to break
my legs if l go out.

782
00:54:39,542 --> 00:54:40,873
Don't act smart.

783
00:54:42,012 --> 00:54:44,071
l made your father to send me out.

784
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:47,250
l made your uncles take me to
all homes and stand guard also.

785
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:50,214
Use it! There's something heavy
in the top of your body.

786
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:53,512
l'm good girl but
not clever like you sir.

787
00:54:53,723 --> 00:54:57,386
But you know to steal when
there's no one inside. right?

788
00:54:57,594 --> 00:54:59,494
l'll never do it again.
please leave me sir.

789
00:54:59,696 --> 00:55:01,493
lt's very difficult in this place.

790
00:55:01,698 --> 00:55:05,634
Difficult? Already a couple has
proved that it's very easy.

791
00:55:05,835 --> 00:55:10,067
lf she has courage to leave home.
l'll take care of other things.

792
00:55:10,273 --> 00:55:12,605
No use if you've that courage.
the girl must also have it.

793
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:14,902
lf she likes me.
she'll get courage on her own.

794
00:55:15,111 --> 00:55:16,043
She must like you. right?

795
00:55:16,246 --> 00:55:20,080
You say it's enough
if l stare into her eyes.

796
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:21,374
l'll make her fall for me.

797
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:25,411
What do l lack to dislike me?

798
00:55:26,589 --> 00:55:28,648
For example. didn't you like me?

799
00:55:31,027 --> 00:55:33,291
Even if she likes. it's waste.
You don't know about people here.

800
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:34,929
What can you do?
You can do nothing.

801
00:55:35,131 --> 00:55:36,257
l'll elope with her.

802
00:55:39,936 --> 00:55:43,633
Like your sister eloped with a man.
l'll also make her elope with me.

803
00:55:47,811 --> 00:55:51,042
We searched every home. brother.

804
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:57,344
Everyone say that it wasn't
our girl's fault.

805
00:55:59,923 --> 00:56:01,515
lt was all the fault
of that bloody idiot.

806
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:07,819
lt seems he threatened to cut or
kill himself if she refuses.

807
00:56:08,898 --> 00:56:13,028
He did all this right before our eyes
and then dared to elope with her too.

808
00:56:13,236 --> 00:56:15,864
lt's wrong...isn't it wrong
to elope. father?

809
00:56:16,072 --> 00:56:17,039
lsn't it wrong then?

810
00:56:19,008 --> 00:56:19,770
lsn't it wrong then?

811
00:56:20,176 --> 00:56:21,302
Tell me?
What are you blabbering?

812
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:22,973
Who teaches you all this?

813
00:56:23,847 --> 00:56:25,610
Go inside.
Go!

814
00:56:29,953 --> 00:56:31,614
He says he'll elope with me.

815
00:56:31,821 --> 00:56:33,686
People at home say they will kill.

816
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:35,858
l'm sure l would've eloped
in my previous birth.

817
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:37,651
That's why all this is
happening to me.

818
00:56:38,094 --> 00:56:41,291
How can it not happen?
You went to free from his clutches.

819
00:56:41,498 --> 00:56:43,295
But you tightened
the noose yourself.

820
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:45,400
lt's very difficult to escape from him.

821
00:56:47,604 --> 00:56:49,401
There's a way to escape.

822
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:52,165
What's is it?
Make another mistake.

823
00:56:56,146 --> 00:56:57,545
l'll help him.

824
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:05,016
Tell me an epic story.
l'm not getting sleep.

825
00:57:07,891 --> 00:57:11,088
She'll not come after you derided her.
No way.

826
00:57:11,294 --> 00:57:12,124
Go to sleep.

827
00:57:12,695 --> 00:57:15,721
l don't need her help.
l'll go myself.

828
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:16,694
Where to?

829
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:19,198
l'll search for her in the same
place where l saw her first.

830
00:57:19,903 --> 00:57:21,598
l'm sure of finding her there.

831
00:57:21,805 --> 00:57:23,466
You mad boy!
Won't your ass stay at one place?

832
00:57:23,673 --> 00:57:25,402
lf you get caught.
3 murders and one suicide.

833
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:27,371
Shut up! Speak if you want to help me.

834
00:57:27,577 --> 00:57:29,772
How can we? ls it some coin or
biscuit to get it for you?

835
00:57:29,979 --> 00:57:31,003
l'll help you sir.

836
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:33,916
You need help.
are you going to help him?

837
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:36,449
One must have courage to love
or make love succeed.

838
00:57:36,653 --> 00:57:38,484
l lost my love because
of my cowardliness.

839
00:57:38,688 --> 00:57:40,713
You've that courage. you'll succeed.

840
00:57:43,593 --> 00:57:45,185
But we both are new to this place.

841
00:57:45,395 --> 00:57:47,056
lt'll be good if anyone who
knows the place helps us.

842
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:49,595
No way! You go to sleep.

843
00:57:49,732 --> 00:57:51,427
You need to know route too.
just love is not enough.

844
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:53,192
l'm here!

845
00:57:54,704 --> 00:57:57,366
l thought he would come starving
but he has put on weight.

846
00:57:58,675 --> 00:58:01,644
Okay brother. if l remember anyone
else. we can search them later.

847
00:58:01,845 --> 00:58:03,403
Go...go man.

848
00:58:08,685 --> 00:58:10,880
Are they not feeding you properly?
You've grown thin.

849
00:58:11,087 --> 00:58:12,850
Where's he?
Has he vapourized?

850
00:58:14,190 --> 00:58:15,088
Are you still alive?

851
00:58:15,725 --> 00:58:17,158
By the way. did you get any
information about them?

852
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:18,725
What do you want to know?
Who wants to know?

853
00:58:18,928 --> 00:58:21,192
You talked about Palakollu friend.
he's asking about that.

854
00:58:21,397 --> 00:58:25,163
That's known as cleverness.
you strained yourself and l used my brain.

855
00:58:25,368 --> 00:58:27,734
You got caught and l escaped.

856
00:58:27,937 --> 00:58:30,462
You are fed with frugal meals
and l was fed with biryani there.

857
00:58:30,673 --> 00:58:33,506
They?
- They are not as bad as you think.

858
00:58:33,710 --> 00:58:35,769
They took me out in Qualis
and fed me with quality food.

859
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:39,915
Why is he dull? Did they beat him
while trying to escape?

860
00:58:40,116 --> 00:58:43,608
Actually what had...
- Keep your mouth shut.

861
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:47,881
Anything personal?
- He's refusing to come on morning walk.

862
00:58:48,091 --> 00:58:49,183
ls morning walk allowed here?

863

Running is problem.

864
00:58:52,128 --> 00:58:55,291
Can't you go on a walk with him?
- Please listen to me...

865
00:58:55,498 --> 00:58:56,624
Bloody pot bellied man!

866
00:59:04,774 --> 00:59:06,867
Let's discuss other things
while on morning walk.

867
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:11,977
What's his position now sir?

868
00:59:13,783 --> 00:59:17,048
Hey buddy! You're finished today.

869
00:59:21,357 --> 00:59:23,154
Why should we jump over walls to walk?

870
00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:25,486
Warm up!
- Shall we jump once more?

871
00:59:25,828 --> 00:59:27,295
There's much to jump. come now.

872
00:59:27,764 --> 00:59:29,925
You go to sleep. Bloody faces.

873
00:59:34,704 --> 00:59:35,329
Come fast.

874
00:59:35,538 --> 00:59:37,836
l would come fast had l been in shorts.

875
00:59:41,377 --> 00:59:43,436
Walk in a rhythm. like this.

876
00:59:46,349 --> 00:59:49,409
l appear like a scholar
but l'm a fool.

877
00:59:50,386 --> 00:59:52,081
Do you know this now?
- l know it long before.

878
00:59:52,288 --> 00:59:53,448
l'm just managing it.

879
00:59:54,524 --> 00:59:58,984
Do you know Babu used to
jog here everyday?

880
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:03,198
l've seen Subbalakshmi also.
l thought she was visiting temple.

881
01:00:03,399 --> 01:00:06,994
Later l came to know she was
practicing running to elope with him.

882
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:10,770
Please don't tell anyone this.
they may thrash me.

883
01:00:11,207 --> 01:00:12,731
Hello Somaraju!

884
01:00:14,477 --> 01:00:15,307

885
01:00:15,511 --> 01:00:16,409
Shut up idiot!

886
01:00:19,349 --> 01:00:20,441
Why did you shut my mouth?

887
01:00:22,652 --> 01:00:24,916
l promised to jog with him.
may feel if he sees me with you.

888
01:00:25,121 --> 01:00:26,588
ls he more to you than me?

889
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:27,881
Okay. where shall we go?

890
01:00:28,091 --> 01:00:30,457
Let's go to the place
where we stopped earlier.

891
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:31,888
We must come back quickly.

892
01:00:33,429 --> 01:00:34,828
Where are you going?
- lt's short cut.

893
01:00:36,032 --> 01:00:37,363
Fool. run!

894
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:39,961
Only walking is allowed
no running please.

895
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:45,967
Losing little weight is enough for me.

896
01:00:46,175 --> 01:00:50,271
l'll get many marriage proposals.
l can settle in life with dowry.

897
01:00:55,818 --> 01:00:56,910
Buddy. come. let's go. Come.

898
01:00:58,087 --> 01:00:59,748
Come fast. dawn may break.

899
01:00:59,956 --> 01:01:01,753
What if it breaks?
Let's walk for some more time.

900
01:01:01,958 --> 01:01:04,791
No...no...enough. Let's go back.

901
01:01:08,698 --> 01:01:10,723
He may feel bad if he
sees you jogging with me.

902
01:01:12,802 --> 01:01:15,032
Anyway we are going back
to the shed. right?

903
01:01:15,238 --> 01:01:16,796
l'll greet him good morning.

904
01:01:17,006 --> 01:01:18,098
Okay. come fast.

905
01:01:22,311 --> 01:01:23,175
Who is it?

906
01:01:25,248 --> 01:01:27,341
Why is he breaking his head
instead of greeting him?

907
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:38,525
Same shot...same punch!
That bloody idiot has escaped.

908
01:01:39,062 --> 01:01:40,029
Catch him!

909
01:01:40,496 --> 01:01:43,329
Stop buddy! Why is he saying
he has escaped?

910
01:01:43,466 --> 01:01:45,832
Aren't we here on a morning walk?

911
01:01:46,035 --> 01:01:49,163
lf they know it's walking
if they don't know it's escape. right?

912
01:01:49,372 --> 01:01:51,533
Are we here with their knowledge
or without their knowledge?

913
01:01:51,741 --> 01:01:53,732
Understand man!
You were born with earth.

914
01:01:54,644 --> 01:01:58,978
ls it escape? l'm doing exercise
without knowing this.

915
01:01:59,949 --> 01:02:01,644
Run man!

916
01:02:01,851 --> 01:02:06,652
Lord! Find the girl he wants
and save me from him.

917
01:02:08,257 --> 01:02:09,554
Let's meet in the shed.

918
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:20,433
We need to go that side
not this side.

919
01:02:20,636 --> 01:02:22,831
Girl..!
- Girl...?

920
01:02:23,439 --> 01:02:25,270
l freed myself to meet her only.

921
01:02:25,475 --> 01:02:27,340
l'm not getting anything.

922
01:02:27,543 --> 01:02:29,340
l love this girl only.

923
01:02:30,813 --> 01:02:32,110
Love her...?

924
01:02:33,015 --> 01:02:35,279
What this twist in mist?

925
01:02:38,988 --> 01:02:48,954
SRI BALAJI

926
01:03:11,621 --> 01:03:12,747
l'll take you to task.

927
01:03:15,525 --> 01:03:18,517
l must kick myself for coming
on morning walk with you.

928
01:03:24,667 --> 01:03:27,067
Who is he?
Not leaving me alone anywhere.

929
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:34,906

l missed the girl.
- But we got caught.

932
01:03:40,183 --> 01:03:43,050
lf we don't reach the shed before
that skinhead. we'll get thrashed.

933
01:03:43,252 --> 01:03:45,743
Come. let's go.
- Walk will not do. let's run.

934
01:03:47,356 --> 01:03:48,983
Where are you going?
- Short cut.

935
01:03:49,192 --> 01:03:50,591
Why did you stop? Run!

936
01:04:01,237 --> 01:04:01,965
Where is he?

937
01:04:02,171 --> 01:04:04,662
He saw a girl near the temple
while escaping earlier.

938
01:04:04,874 --> 01:04:08,037
He went again to meet her with Papa Rao.
We don't know anything.

939
01:04:08,244 --> 01:04:11,702
Cooking up tales?
- We swear we don't know anything sir.

940
01:04:11,981 --> 01:04:13,539
l'll take you to task.

941
01:04:14,083 --> 01:04:18,383
Nephew!

942
01:04:18,588 --> 01:04:20,852
Don't take me on a jog even if l ask.

943
01:04:22,258 --> 01:04:24,351
Nephew! They have escaped! Come!

944
01:04:25,328 --> 01:04:27,660
We must be inside before
lights are switched on.

945
01:04:27,997 --> 01:04:30,056
Lights are on.

946
01:04:30,466 --> 01:04:33,026
lf we run like this we'll die
instead of growing thin.

947
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:38,469
Bloody idiots!
How dare you cheat us!

948
01:04:38,674 --> 01:04:40,073
Trying to escape from us.

949
01:04:40,276 --> 01:04:42,471
What do you think of me?
- Hey get up man!

950
01:04:42,979 --> 01:04:45,379
You...
- Oh my God!

951
01:04:46,215 --> 01:04:47,876
You both went out. right?

952
01:04:48,084 --> 01:04:49,984
Why are you asking again
what you already know. you skinhead?

953

01:04:54,924 --> 01:04:55,652
Let's take him to task.

956

What will you do man?

957
01:04:58,895 --> 01:05:01,762
Say sorry and fall at my feet.
Bloody!

958
01:05:03,532 --> 01:05:05,830
Fall...fall at my feet.

959
01:05:06,769 --> 01:05:08,396
Why did you change your posture?

960
01:05:08,604 --> 01:05:10,504
What happened. uncle?
- What's it sir?

961
01:05:10,706 --> 01:05:12,503
Nephew. they went out.

962
01:05:12,708 --> 01:05:14,869
Did we go out to have a coffee in hotel?

963
01:05:15,077 --> 01:05:16,135
He's lying. nephew.

964
01:05:16,345 --> 01:05:18,176
He beat me there also.
- Where?

965
01:05:18,381 --> 01:05:19,348
Near the railway tracks.

966
01:05:19,548 --> 01:05:22,711
Yes. l was there.
You go and get him.

967
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:24,011
l'll go then.

968
01:05:25,721 --> 01:05:28,349
Why are you harassing early morning
about seeing me elsewhere?

969
01:05:28,557 --> 01:05:30,525
Ask Pandu. he'll tell you.

970
01:05:33,496 --> 01:05:35,964
Uncle. still in hangover mood.

971
01:05:36,399 --> 01:05:37,866
Why would they come back
if they had escaped?

972
01:05:38,267 --> 01:05:39,700
Don't rush.

973
01:05:40,102 --> 01:05:42,662
Close the door properly.
thank God they didn't escape.

974
01:05:47,343 --> 01:05:49,436
Can't you give me a hint?

975
01:05:49,745 --> 01:05:51,542
We used the brain and
you strained yourself.

976
01:05:51,747 --> 01:05:53,374
We escaped and you got caught.

977
01:05:53,582 --> 01:05:55,675
Looks like you were jogging
instead of walking.

978
01:05:57,053 --> 01:06:02,013
lt's notjogging but running.
high jump. long jump.

979
01:06:02,224 --> 01:06:06,820
l think l had a very bad long jump.
- What happened?

980
01:06:08,497 --> 01:06:10,021
My hand slipped.

981
01:06:10,866 --> 01:06:12,163
ls falling in love so difficult?

982
01:06:12,368 --> 01:06:15,599
Being a lover's friend is
much more difficult.

983
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:18,038
Don't get tensed. buddies.

984
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:20,673
The time is ripe for me to find her soon.

985
01:06:20,876 --> 01:06:23,936
No. l feel we are nearing our end.

986
01:06:24,347 --> 01:06:25,336
Be careful!

987
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:28,776
Thank God! Have you come?

988
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:30,213
Nobody inquired about me. right?

989
01:06:30,419 --> 01:06:31,886
l covered it well. but did you see it?

990
01:06:32,088 --> 01:06:34,283
l'm dying with tension.
See that nobody comes.

991
01:06:34,490 --> 01:06:35,514
l'll go to the shed.

992
01:06:37,259 --> 01:06:38,988
You're getting adventurous
with every passing day.

993
01:06:39,195 --> 01:06:42,062
let me see how far you will go.

994
01:06:50,439 --> 01:06:51,929
The post box has come!

995
01:06:57,580 --> 01:06:58,069
Who is it?

996
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:00,111
Our hero trapped this girl
to find his girl.

997
01:07:02,418 --> 01:07:05,046
Who is this girl?
- Neelakantam's younger daughter.

998
01:07:08,524 --> 01:07:09,616
New entrant. right?

999
01:07:09,959 --> 01:07:11,620
Did you search for her?

1000
01:07:12,261 --> 01:07:13,057
Got any information?

1001
01:07:13,262 --> 01:07:15,253
Mother promise. l searched for her.

1002
01:07:16,132 --> 01:07:21,035
This place has 642 houses
not 615 as you said.

1003
01:07:21,237 --> 01:07:24,968
There are 44 unmarried girls here
not 39 as you said.

1004
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:29,102
Every one claims she's the
most beautiful girl here.

1005
01:07:29,745 --> 01:07:30,871
They are lying.

1006
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:33,207
l too felt like that only.

1007
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:36,848
l can't take it any more.
l searched entire place.

1008
01:07:37,053 --> 01:07:38,680
only l'm left now.

1009
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:40,719
lf you want see me also.

1010
01:07:50,599 --> 01:07:52,464
Okay. don't get tensed.

1011
01:07:53,402 --> 01:07:56,371
it's little difficult to find a girl
with my descriptions.

1012
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:02,700
that's why l found an easy clue
to find that girl.

1013
01:08:02,912 --> 01:08:04,277
Oh no! l didn't see anything.

1014
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:07,574
l can easily find her with this clue.

1015
01:08:08,451 --> 01:08:12,285
Give it to me. if l find her.
l'll be at peace.

1016
01:08:12,588 --> 01:08:14,818
l'm not able to stay calm in house.

1017
01:08:15,024 --> 01:08:17,424
l'm blabbering nonsense in home.

1018
01:08:17,626 --> 01:08:19,184
l'll definitely find the girl...

1019
01:08:24,333 --> 01:08:34,299


1020
01:08:51,861 --> 01:08:52,725
What...

1021
01:08:56,832 --> 01:08:57,594
What?

1022
01:09:00,369 --> 01:09:01,529
Nothing father.

1023
01:09:09,378 --> 01:09:19,344


1024
01:09:27,062 --> 01:09:29,792
Don't run away little girl...

1025
01:09:31,734 --> 01:09:34,464
Though it's futile...

1026
01:09:41,277 --> 01:09:45,373
Today or tomorrow.
it's bound to happen...

1027
01:09:45,581 --> 01:09:51,042
l'm sitting in your heart
observing you...

1028
01:09:55,357 --> 01:09:58,451
l'm coming for you...

1029
01:10:00,129 --> 01:10:02,927
Would l leave if you say no?

1030
01:10:09,438 --> 01:10:19,404


1031
01:11:00,656 --> 01:11:02,817
Coming before me beautifully...

1032
01:11:03,025 --> 01:11:05,118
Captivating me with your youth...

1033
01:11:05,327 --> 01:11:07,420
Made me go crazy on you...

1034
01:11:07,630 --> 01:11:10,190
And arrested me here...

1035
01:11:12,434 --> 01:11:14,425
Making entry silently...

1036
01:11:14,637 --> 01:11:16,764
Devastating me with beauty...

1037
01:11:16,972 --> 01:11:19,133
After making me come here for you...

1038
01:11:19,341 --> 01:11:23,334
Don't tell me to go back...

1039
01:12:33,982 --> 01:12:36,109
Shuddering from imaginations
are witness...

1040
01:12:36,318 --> 01:12:38,309
Your breathlessness is an evidence...

1041
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:40,715
Fear in your eyes is an evidence...

1042
01:12:40,923 --> 01:12:43,414
Shivering lips is an evidence...

1043
01:12:45,594 --> 01:12:50,156
You must find the truth
and trust it. O maiden...

1044
01:12:50,366 --> 01:12:56,703
Stop being obstinate...
Give yourself to me...

1045
01:13:04,613 --> 01:13:14,579
SRI BALAJI

1046
01:13:23,632 --> 01:13:24,929
No...please leave me!

1047
01:13:30,606 --> 01:13:32,870
What happened madam?
Any bad dream?

1048
01:13:33,075 --> 01:13:35,441
You said there's no man in my life.

1049
01:13:36,478 --> 01:13:37,672
A man has entered.

1050
01:13:38,247 --> 01:13:40,078
ls he in love with you?

1051
01:13:41,350 --> 01:13:44,751
All these days you were
searching yourself.

1052
01:13:45,954 --> 01:13:48,218
Did you see him?
- No.

1053
01:13:48,424 --> 01:13:50,551
Did he see you?
- No.

1054
01:13:50,759 --> 01:13:54,286
Does he know you're the girl he loves?
- No.

1055
01:13:54,496 --> 01:13:56,930
Thank God!
Half of my tension has eased.

1056
01:13:57,132 --> 01:13:59,828
Madam. you're in danger.

1057
01:14:00,035 --> 01:14:01,059
What shall we do now?

1058
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:03,500
What can we do? Pray to God!

1059
01:14:03,705 --> 01:14:04,330
What should l pray?

1060
01:14:04,540 --> 01:14:09,307
One. to find your sister quickly.
two. he mustn't see you.

1061
01:14:12,347 --> 01:14:17,148
Come...come...
- Where are you taking us?

1062
01:14:17,352 --> 01:14:19,479
We found Nellore Seenu. Come.

1063
01:14:25,093 --> 01:14:28,426
l think he got good thrashing
for getting caught late.

1064
01:14:28,630 --> 01:14:30,928
l'll kill you. Tell me!

1065
01:14:35,804 --> 01:14:37,635

if you don't tell me. l'll thrash you
along with your friends.

1067
01:14:41,477 --> 01:14:42,774
You'll die a dog's death.

1068
01:14:43,011 --> 01:14:45,809
Tell me...tell me...

1069
01:14:47,216 --> 01:14:49,480

01:14:58,894 --> 01:15:00,828
Tell me. did they call you on phone?

1074
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:03,423

for Chennai with load.

1075
01:15:03,899 --> 01:15:06,732
l got a phone call to mill. l swear
l don't know anything after that.

1076
01:15:06,935 --> 01:15:08,368
Where did they call you from?

1077
01:15:08,570 --> 01:15:10,765
From Vizag sir!

1078
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:12,670
From Vizag!

01:15:14,743 --> 01:15:24,709

What's our position now?

1084
01:15:48,544 --> 01:15:50,034
lf they find the girl.

You come in the lift.

lf anything goes wrong.
you all are dead.

1094
01:16:51,506 --> 01:16:52,632
Why are you watching?

1095

Why are you here?- l couldn't come
from here so l came from there.

Do you've any sense?

You planned the time for escape
and switched off the phone.

l didn't switch off the phone.
your people broke it.- My people?

1100
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,433
After you eloped. they came
and took me as hostage.

1101
01:17:19,635 --> 01:17:21,432
l told you not to tell anyone
about staying here.

1102
01:17:21,637 --> 01:17:23,229
why did you tell Seenu?

1103
01:17:23,572 --> 01:17:24,266
This house. right?

1104
01:17:24,473 --> 01:17:27,203
Matter is out. your uncles are here.

They are here. come here.
Let's go from here.

01:17:34,349 --> 01:17:36,510
Are you sure this is the house?
- l'm scared.

1107
01:17:37,219 --> 01:17:39,449
You don't get scared.

1108
01:17:39,655 --> 01:17:40,952
He got us married.

1126
01:18:35,544 --> 01:18:36,511
You search that side!

1127
01:18:42,718 --> 01:18:43,776
Just a minute. wait!

1128
01:18:46,888 --> 01:18:49,220
Hide..hide...go.

1129
01:18:49,725 --> 01:18:52,125
They left two days ago.
- Where?

1130
01:18:52,327 --> 01:18:53,624
Where did they go?

1131
01:18:56,064 --> 01:18:59,932
They called Nellore.

l don't know.

1135
01:19:16,351 --> 01:19:17,511
Come quickly.

1136
01:19:26,528 --> 01:19:27,552

You both be brave.
Ramesh will receive you.

1141
01:19:42,778 --> 01:19:43,836
He'll take care of everything.

1142
01:19:44,045 --> 01:19:45,569
You don't worry. okay?

1143
01:19:47,716 --> 01:19:48,614
l forgot it.

1144

Keep this money for emergency.

1145
01:19:56,525 --> 01:19:57,719
Okay bye...

1146
01:19:58,026 --> 01:19:59,254
Stop...stop...

1147
01:20:04,633 --> 01:20:06,794
What's it?
- Are you both happy?

1148
01:20:09,971 --> 01:20:11,461
l'll take care of everything.
you carry on.

1149
01:20:16,978 --> 01:20:17,706
Be careful!

1150
01:20:21,716 --> 01:20:24,276
Where did you go away?
Where did you escape?

1151
01:20:24,519 --> 01:20:27,283
Escape? l went out for a tea.

1152
01:20:27,489 --> 01:20:28,547
Who gave you permission to leave?

1153
01:20:28,757 --> 01:20:32,989
ls it escaping if l go out for a tea?
This is too much.

1154
01:20:33,195 --> 01:20:34,958
Why would l come back
if l had escaped?

1155
01:20:35,597 --> 01:20:36,689
Can't you inform and go?

1156
01:20:37,098 --> 01:20:38,395
What happened?

1157
01:20:38,834 --> 01:20:39,960
Didn't find them?
- We searched everywhere.

1158
01:20:40,168 --> 01:20:41,100
They are not here.

1159
01:20:59,688 --> 01:21:01,485
Lock them up here.

1160
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:08,160
What are you doing there?
Come out.

1161
01:21:19,374 --> 01:21:20,238
Come on boys.

1162
01:21:22,878 --> 01:21:24,709
Playing drama after doing everything?

1163
01:21:24,913 --> 01:21:26,676
You helped Babu in all possible ways.

1164
01:21:26,882 --> 01:21:30,409
and shouted on us for
telling your name.

1165
01:21:30,619 --> 01:21:31,745
why didn't you tell us this?

1166
01:21:31,953 --> 01:21:33,978
Why should l tell you?

1167
01:21:35,490 --> 01:21:36,616
Krishna. calm down.

1168
01:21:37,626 --> 01:21:39,526
Just few punches and you
gave names of three places.

1169
01:21:39,728 --> 01:21:41,355
one more punch and you'll
reveal their address too.

1170
01:21:41,730 --> 01:21:42,754
Why should l tell you cowards?

1171
01:21:42,964 --> 01:21:44,693
Her mother cried and
almost fell at your feet.

1172
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:45,958
didn't you feel like telling
her atleast then?

1173
01:21:46,167 --> 01:21:49,694
No. her mother's cries or father's angry
bursts are not important to me.

1174
01:21:49,905 --> 01:21:52,373
our friend Babu and Subbalakshmi
must be happy. that's all!

1175
01:21:52,574 --> 01:21:54,599
Okay agreed.
we are not as gutsy as you.

1176
01:21:54,809 --> 01:21:56,140
even after going through all this hell.

1177
01:21:56,344 --> 01:21:58,039
why did you help them again in Vizag?

1178
01:21:58,246 --> 01:22:01,044
He's my friend.
l promised him help.

1179
01:22:01,249 --> 01:22:02,477
l'm ready to give my life also
if a need arises.

1180
01:22:02,684 --> 01:22:04,549
You will because you're a great man.

1181
01:22:04,753 --> 01:22:06,050
You will give life for friends.

1182
01:22:06,254 --> 01:22:09,553
Okay but why are taking our
lives again here for a love?

1183
01:22:09,758 --> 01:22:11,191
Are we not your friends?

1184
01:22:11,426 --> 01:22:14,088
You're my friends. right?
Then give your lives for me.

1185
01:22:14,796 --> 01:22:17,287
lt's useless to talk to you.
you've become very selfish.

1186
01:22:17,499 --> 01:22:20,297
Who is not selfish?
For you it's life.

1187
01:22:20,568 --> 01:22:22,559
for Neelakantam.
it's honour and prestige.

1188
01:22:22,771 --> 01:22:25,399
for the girl who talks
to me from window.

1189
01:22:25,607 --> 01:22:27,074
she's not bothered about
anything happening to this world.

1190
01:22:27,275 --> 01:22:30,836
she's selfish about her safety.
let anything may happen to her sister.

1191
01:22:31,279 --> 01:22:33,577
Like that l'm selfish about
my love and my happiness.

1192
01:22:40,155 --> 01:22:43,716
Some girl has heard us talking.
Come this side.

1193
01:22:46,828 --> 01:22:49,729
ls she gone?
- May be she'll tell them.

1194
01:22:52,334 --> 01:22:55,303
That girl has heard us talking.
- She may tell them.

1195
01:22:55,503 --> 01:22:56,299
Who is this girl?

1196
01:22:56,504 --> 01:23:00,406
You're no ordinary girl. you cleverly
freed yourself from his clutches.

1197
01:23:01,142 --> 01:23:02,734
He's also no ordinary guy.

1198
01:23:02,978 --> 01:23:05,879
he was the man who helped
my sister and Babu all these days.

1199
01:23:06,081 --> 01:23:08,413
He's the man who helped them
to escape in Vizag.

1200
01:23:10,518 --> 01:23:12,611
What should we do now?
- We shouldn't do anything.

1201
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:15,415
lt's safe for us to stay out of this.

1202
01:23:17,058 --> 01:23:18,286
Who did you say helped them to escape?

1203
01:23:18,660 --> 01:23:20,252
l don't know.
- Who is he?

1204
01:23:20,495 --> 01:23:22,793
l don't know uncle.
- Brother!

1205
01:23:22,998 --> 01:23:24,431
Bring those boys out.

Why should l tell you?

1253
01:27:49,264 --> 01:27:50,697
What was their mistake?

1254
01:27:50,999 --> 01:27:53,524
They loved each other and
ran away to save it.

1255
01:27:53,735 --> 01:27:56,898
ls it wrong?
- This is common in youth.

1256
01:27:57,105 --> 01:27:58,970
No. it is correct.

1257
01:27:59,340 --> 01:28:01,274
Don't try to catch them.

1258
01:28:01,476 --> 01:28:02,875
They will be happy
wherever they may be.

1259
01:28:03,077 --> 01:28:04,169
But l'm not happy.

1260
01:28:07,615 --> 01:28:08,513
l'm not happy.

1261
01:28:09,450 --> 01:28:12,214
l want them.
- You'll never find them.

1262
01:28:14,756 --> 01:28:18,590
l'll kill you. bloody bastard!
- l'm ready to die for my friend.

1263
01:28:18,793 --> 01:28:23,355
ls it? Let me see how many friends
you'll sacrifice for one friend.

1264
01:28:33,274 --> 01:28:34,764
Where's the knife?

1265
01:28:39,881 --> 01:28:43,044
Die for your friend.
- They are in Hyderabad!

1266
01:28:46,954 --> 01:28:49,252
Where? Where are they in Hyderabad?

1267
01:28:49,457 --> 01:28:52,483
l got them into a bus going
to Hyderabad. that's all l know.

1268
01:28:52,694 --> 01:28:56,357
ls it true or false?
- True! Believe it or not!

1269
01:29:02,337 --> 01:29:05,238
You looked into his eyes deeply.
did anything happen to you?

1270
01:29:06,474 --> 01:29:07,907
Let anything may happen.

1271
01:29:08,309 --> 01:29:10,777
it seems they will be taken
to Hyderabad tomorrow.

1272
01:29:11,179 --> 01:29:13,511
they will be freed
if your sister is found.

1273
01:29:13,715 --> 01:29:15,205
or else they will be buried alive.

1274
01:29:15,483 --> 01:29:18,509
At any cost they will
never come back here.

1275
01:29:24,559 --> 01:29:27,722
Come. let's go. Why are you
thinking about an unknown girl?

1276
01:29:27,929 --> 01:29:28,759
l know her.

1277
01:29:30,665 --> 01:29:31,393
You know her?

1278
01:29:32,166 --> 01:29:33,098
Who is she?

1279
01:29:34,736 --> 01:29:39,036
The girl who talked to us
all these days. Meena.

1280
01:29:39,874 --> 01:29:41,239
Neelakantam's younger daughter.

1281
01:29:42,710 --> 01:29:45,178
Have you gone mad?
What's this crazy idea?

1282
01:29:45,380 --> 01:29:48,213
Did you save our lives to
get us killed again?- Shut up!

1283
01:29:49,016 --> 01:29:50,813
ls it enough if he loves her?

1284
01:29:51,018 --> 01:29:52,542
Shouldn't the girl have that courage?

1285
01:29:52,887 --> 01:29:53,911
She was scared to look at him also.

1286
01:29:54,021 --> 01:29:57,013
Whatever you think will not come true.
- Are you ready to leave?

1287
01:29:57,458 --> 01:29:59,983
Look. we are leaving to Hyderabad.

1288
01:30:00,528 --> 01:30:02,894
He can't do anything. let's go.
- Come.

1289
01:30:03,097 --> 01:30:04,928
Put an end to crazy ideas
and come with us.

1290
01:30:09,504 --> 01:30:10,971
Check if the door is locked properly.

1291
01:30:13,207 --> 01:30:15,198
Rs.3000 diesel for each vehicle.
- Give it to them.

1292
01:30:15,410 --> 01:30:17,742
Okay.
- Let's see accounts later.- Okay.

1293
01:30:25,119 --> 01:30:26,643
He's ogling at the girl again.

1294
01:30:28,322 --> 01:30:31,052
Let him see for the last time.
Vehicle will leave in 5 minutes.

1295
01:30:31,259 --> 01:30:32,749
The love story will end here only. come.

1296
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:40,194
Get into those three vehicles also.

1297
01:30:42,136 --> 01:30:42,864
lnto that vehicle.

1298
01:30:48,810 --> 01:30:49,708
What are you doing here?

1299
01:30:51,412 --> 01:30:55,371
Hey girl! Do you love anyone?

1300
01:30:59,487 --> 01:31:01,284
Come out bravely if you've
any one in your heart.

1301
01:31:02,156 --> 01:31:04,386
Atleast then a group of friends like us
would escape this torture.

1302
01:31:04,592 --> 01:31:06,890
What are you blabbering?
- What's wrong in it. sir?

1303
01:31:07,094 --> 01:31:08,459
We are all going to Hyderabad.

1304
01:31:08,663 --> 01:31:10,927
lf she too runs away
after we are gone.

1305
01:31:11,132 --> 01:31:13,794
You'll catch us again.
That's why l'm asking her confirmation.

1306
01:31:14,001 --> 01:31:15,161
You don't love anyone. right dear?

1307
01:31:15,369 --> 01:31:17,462
l'll kill you if you talk
bad about our daughter.

1308
01:31:17,672 --> 01:31:19,697
We are going to Hyderabad
for your daughter only.

1309
01:31:34,121 --> 01:31:35,816
What are you thinking?
What's your plan?

1310
01:31:40,728 --> 01:31:50,694


1311
01:31:58,579 --> 01:31:59,546
Brother!

1312
01:32:02,350 --> 01:32:03,510
Let Meena also come with us.

1313
01:32:06,854 --> 01:32:07,821
Why brother?

1314
01:32:10,491 --> 01:32:11,515
She's a girl.

1315
01:32:12,693 --> 01:32:14,820
How many precautions
we take to protect them?

1316
01:32:15,663 --> 01:32:21,533
l don't want the mistake to
happen again in our home.

1317
01:32:22,436 --> 01:32:24,165
Go. get her. Go.

1318
01:32:26,340 --> 01:32:28,706
The mistake we wished not
to happen is happening now.

1319
01:32:28,910 --> 01:32:32,073
We were happy of coming out of pot.
but he pushed us into fire now.

1320
01:32:32,280 --> 01:32:33,975
Whatever you wish will
not happen always.

1321
01:32:34,215 --> 01:32:36,115
l've time till we find Subbalakshmi.

1322
01:32:36,317 --> 01:32:37,648
By then...
- By then...?

1323
01:32:37,852 --> 01:32:39,979
l'll definitely make Meena
to say l love you to me.

1324
01:32:52,099 --> 01:32:54,192
You got worried for crossing
your threshold.

1325
01:32:54,702 --> 01:32:56,795
now he's making you cross
your village boundary.

1326
01:32:57,538 --> 01:32:58,368

1327
01:33:02,810 --> 01:33:12,776

Every one of which wants

Though you put shackles...

01:33:46,354 --> 01:33:50,723
You can't find a better
man than me...

1335
01:33:50,925 --> 01:33:55,294
You can't find a better
lover than me...

1336
01:33:55,496 --> 01:33:59,899
lf l become yours.
it's better for you...

1337
01:34:00,101 --> 01:34:04,561
You won't get any opportunity
to leave me...

1338
01:34:10,878 --> 01:34:20,844


1339
01:34:44,679 --> 01:34:46,112
Where are you?

1340
01:34:59,694 --> 01:35:03,960
l'm surprized.

1341
01:35:04,165 --> 01:35:08,534
lf l wish even angels
will come for me...

1342
01:35:08,736 --> 01:35:13,036
Don't be so adamant to vex me...

1343
01:35:13,240 --> 01:35:17,700
lf you give me liberty. my smile
will always be on your lips...

1344
01:35:17,912 --> 01:35:22,246
You were in an unknown
corner of the world...

1345
01:35:22,450 --> 01:35:27,285
l'll give you the sky
if you love me a little...

1346
01:36:24,311 --> 01:36:28,645
Eras ago Lord Rama
crossed the sea...

1347
01:36:28,849 --> 01:36:33,149
Built a bridge to find his Seetha...

1348
01:36:33,354 --> 01:36:37,757
Your silence is like a sea
between us...

1349
01:36:37,958 --> 01:36:42,327
l'll build a bridge with my heart
to become yours...

1350
01:36:42,530 --> 01:36:46,899
l'll lasso the moon and
present it to you...

1351
01:36:47,101 --> 01:36:51,936
Don't waste time thinking over it...

1352
01:36:54,041 --> 01:37:04,007

01:37:29,743 --> 01:37:31,472
Can't he apply brakes slowly?

1354

You told them they are here.
what if they are caught?

1355
01:37:37,084 --> 01:37:39,052
They will get caught
if they are really here.

1356
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:42,013
What are you saying man?

1357

1358
01:37:45,192 --> 01:37:46,989
They will not get caught till l'm alive.

to crush in affection?

1376
01:39:00,634 --> 01:39:01,498
Who are they?

1377
01:39:02,069 --> 01:39:03,593
People who helped them to elope.

1378
01:39:05,172 --> 01:39:06,332
Are these those guys?

1379
01:39:06,740 --> 01:39:10,471
How dare you kidnap
a girl from our family?

1380
01:39:10,778 --> 01:39:12,746
How dare!

1381
01:39:13,480 --> 01:39:14,742
Just one man. that's him!

1382
01:39:15,749 --> 01:39:17,683
Hey you!

1383
01:39:18,485 --> 01:39:22,387
Put them in the room with
Pinku. Tinku and Dolly.

1384
01:39:23,190 --> 01:39:25,055
Names are great.
figures will be ravishing.

1385
01:39:25,259 --> 01:39:26,692
Bloody. they are dogs.

1386
01:39:26,961 --> 01:39:28,553
Take it dear....brother...

1387
01:39:31,498 --> 01:39:34,558
Why is he always with her like
a mother monkey carrying it's kid?

1388
01:39:34,768 --> 01:39:36,531
May be in fear of losing her
to a monkey like you.

1389
01:39:37,438 --> 01:39:40,635
Where to search for them
in such a big city?

1390
01:39:40,841 --> 01:39:42,308
We've to start from some place.

1391
01:39:42,509 --> 01:39:45,603
Notjust one. there are
10 railway stations. 20 bus stations.

1392
01:39:45,813 --> 01:39:49,340
50 parks. 100 theatres.
above all these 1000's of hostels.

1393
01:39:49,550 --> 01:39:50,574
Do we've to search so many places?

1394
01:39:50,784 --> 01:39:53,753
lt's marriage season too.
don't know in which temple they are now.

1395
01:39:54,154 --> 01:39:54,643
Brother.

1396
01:39:54,855 --> 01:39:58,951
Check the temple register.
Don't leave any place.

1397
01:39:59,493 --> 01:40:01,085
Why did you bring us here?

1398
01:40:01,295 --> 01:40:04,856
They need a place to search
and l need a place to love.

1399
01:40:05,499 --> 01:40:06,864
What's our position now?

1400
01:40:07,067 --> 01:40:09,160
Guarding!
- Who will stand guard?

1401
01:40:11,238 --> 01:40:21,204
SRI BALAJI

1402
01:40:30,424 --> 01:40:31,789
Listen to me...stop...

1403
01:40:32,092 --> 01:40:34,185
Wait..would you like to have coconut?

1404
01:40:35,329 --> 01:40:36,057
Don't worry!

1405
01:40:36,997 --> 01:40:39,932
Without knowing it was you.
l told you about my love to you only.

1406
01:40:40,534 --> 01:40:42,161
lf there's anything now.
it's your turn to tell me.

1407
01:40:42,369 --> 01:40:44,803
Go way. if my father comes
to know. he'll kill you.

1408
01:40:45,005 --> 01:40:45,869
He can't.

1409
01:40:46,073 --> 01:40:48,803
Why don't you say Krishna
instead of father?

1410
01:40:49,009 --> 01:40:51,204
Your life will be settled.
What do you say?

1411
01:40:51,412 --> 01:40:54,381
This auspicious time comes
once in 60 years only.

1412
01:40:54,581 --> 01:40:57,311
Couples marrying in this auspicious time...
- Very auspicious!

1413
01:40:57,518 --> 01:40:59,179
Just say yes. l'll tie the knot.

1414
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:00,817
Yes?
- No!

1415
01:41:01,021 --> 01:41:04,752
Say yes. next year let's come with our son
and name him after your father.

1416
01:41:05,959 --> 01:41:06,755
Ready?

1417
01:41:08,529 --> 01:41:09,757
He's coming.

1418
01:41:12,399 --> 01:41:14,890
l told you to stop him
but you fell at his feet.- Stop him.

1419
01:41:20,908 --> 01:41:23,342
Father-in-law is keeping watch there.
he wants you to be on vigil here.

1420
01:41:23,544 --> 01:41:24,909
l'll look after this place.
- Okay.

1421
01:41:27,214 --> 01:41:28,875
Father-in-law?
He's brother-in-law. right!

1422
01:41:29,083 --> 01:41:29,947
Okay let it be anything.

1423
01:41:32,719 --> 01:41:33,879
Where is she?

1424
01:41:35,622 --> 01:41:37,089
Where did you go away?

1425
01:41:37,491 --> 01:41:39,015
Have you thought about
what l told you?

1426
01:41:39,226 --> 01:41:42,855
l'm here with 20 men for
thinking about you and love.

1427
01:41:43,063 --> 01:41:44,530
Hereafter l'll think about myself only.

1428
01:41:44,731 --> 01:41:47,529
Think and tell. do you like me?
- l don't like you.

1429
01:41:47,801 --> 01:41:49,359
What do l lack to make
you dislike me?

1430
01:41:49,570 --> 01:41:50,798
l said l don't like you.

1431
01:41:51,672 --> 01:41:52,866
Show your face while talking.

1432
01:41:53,974 --> 01:41:55,134
No problem. it's fine.

1433
01:41:55,342 --> 01:41:56,604
l didn't see clearly then
mistaking you for someone else.

1434
01:41:56,810 --> 01:41:57,640
Let it be like that. it's fine.

1435
01:41:57,845 --> 01:42:00,405
Father...father...
- Father-in-law...father-in-law...

1436
01:42:00,614 --> 01:42:01,979
l'll tell my father.

1437
01:42:02,182 --> 01:42:05,447
Your father? He mistrusts you.
that's why he's taking you with him.

1438
01:42:06,954 --> 01:42:10,219
l don't care if anyone trusts me or not.
l trust myself.

1439
01:42:10,424 --> 01:42:12,756
l'll not fall for your words.
l'll never love you.

1440
01:42:14,495 --> 01:42:17,396
Say something like that only then
l'll know how much l've to try.

1441
01:42:19,666 --> 01:42:20,690
Oh no! Father!

1442
01:42:20,901 --> 01:42:24,337
They don't give me 10 minutes also
to talk to my love. bloody idiots.

1443
01:42:25,639 --> 01:42:27,573
Come sir. we are dying
to stand guard.

1444
01:42:27,774 --> 01:42:31,972
You left your daughter alone here.
lt's city. we can't trust anyone here.

1445
01:42:32,112 --> 01:42:34,239
l checked the register. no clues.

1446
01:42:34,515 --> 01:42:37,484
They suggested checking
with Arya Samaj near by.

1447
01:42:42,122 --> 01:42:44,556
How can l love in Arya Samaj?
lt won't be nice.

1448
01:42:56,036 --> 01:42:59,096
Brother. stay here.
l'll go and inquire.

1449
01:42:59,306 --> 01:43:00,204
Come. brother-in-law.

1450
01:43:01,308 --> 01:43:03,776
Come dear.
- l'm not able to roam with this body.

1451
01:43:03,977 --> 01:43:05,467
Order something to eat.

1452
01:43:06,513 --> 01:43:07,207
Sit.

1453
01:43:09,249 --> 01:43:11,615
Sit. bloody coward.

1454
01:43:11,818 --> 01:43:14,150
They are boring people.
it's waste of time.

1455
01:43:14,354 --> 01:43:16,015
Why don't you tell them that?

1456
01:43:16,223 --> 01:43:18,157
You tell them.
we don't want that credit too.

1457
01:43:18,358 --> 01:43:19,655
lt'll blow up before you finish it.

1458
01:43:20,360 --> 01:43:21,452
Neither you nor l can say it.

1459
01:43:21,662 --> 01:43:24,256
someone should tell them
in a proper way.

1460
01:43:29,836 --> 01:43:31,667
Your people are not here. come.

1461
01:43:32,839 --> 01:43:36,741
Nobody followed you. right?
Are media people here?

1462
01:43:37,177 --> 01:43:39,372
Are you any celebrity to follow?
- My foot!

1463
01:43:39,580 --> 01:43:40,877
First settle the auto fare.

1464
01:43:41,348 --> 01:43:43,908
Pay auto fare.
- Pay him.- Fast!

1465
01:43:44,685 --> 01:43:47,245
Come and sit here.
- Sit here.

1466
01:43:48,055 --> 01:43:49,852
ls it fresh?
- Fresh only. bought itjust now.

1467
01:43:50,857 --> 01:43:52,916
For all our guys...
- l think it's a love marriage.

1468
01:43:53,126 --> 01:43:54,650
ls the videographer here?
- He's here.

1469
01:43:55,696 --> 01:43:57,926
Brother. cool drink.
- One is enough.

1470
01:43:58,131 --> 01:44:00,463
l'll make arrangements inside.
- Okay. carry on.

1471
01:44:01,034 --> 01:44:03,867
You want? No...no problem.

1472
01:44:05,372 --> 01:44:06,703
They are asking if parents are here.

1473
01:44:06,907 --> 01:44:09,375
Tell them they are busy
searching for us.- Okay.

1474
01:44:11,712 --> 01:44:14,510
Why is the girl crying?

1475
01:44:14,715 --> 01:44:17,809
She wants her daddy.
useless daddy.

1476
01:44:18,085 --> 01:44:20,519
He earned like Bill Gates
but heartless man.

1477
01:44:20,721 --> 01:44:22,985
Have it. did your father ever
bought you a drink?

1478
01:44:23,557 --> 01:44:25,047
But l'm a motor mechanic.

1479
01:44:25,259 --> 01:44:26,817
l'll fix few bolts and
feed her with biryani.

1480
01:44:27,027 --> 01:44:28,517
What else can anyone
do more than this?

1481
01:44:30,030 --> 01:44:32,225
Neelu got blasted!
- Who is Neelu?

1482
01:44:32,499 --> 01:44:33,989
Oh Neelakantam!

1483
01:44:34,735 --> 01:44:37,704
Won't her parents feel sad hearing this?

1484
01:44:38,071 --> 01:44:40,369
My foot sad!
May be for two months only.

1485
01:44:40,574 --> 01:44:41,700
lf not another month also.

1486
01:44:41,908 --> 01:44:44,706
They will search for us
and we'll hide from them.

1487
01:44:44,911 --> 01:44:47,880
They will get bored and
one fine day they'll knock the door.

1488
01:44:48,081 --> 01:44:51,050
and say. son-in-law.
come home with my daughter.

1489
01:44:51,251 --> 01:44:51,740
That's all!

1490
01:44:51,952 --> 01:44:54,113
Same day they will arrange reception.
that's curtains down for the event.

1491
01:44:54,321 --> 01:44:55,583
lsn't it?
- Yes dear.

1492
01:44:55,789 --> 01:44:56,551
Listen to her.

1493
01:44:59,760 --> 01:45:01,318
How do you fall in love?

1494
01:45:04,431 --> 01:45:09,164
Love is born there. here.

1495
01:45:09,603 --> 01:45:10,069
place is not correct.

1496
01:45:10,270 --> 01:45:11,202
dude. come here.

1497
01:45:12,105 --> 01:45:13,663
l'm calling you only.

1498
01:45:15,842 --> 01:45:16,740
here too!

1499
01:45:17,878 --> 01:45:18,936
lt'll never happen to me.

1500
01:45:19,613 --> 01:45:21,513
The innocent girl sitting behind you.

1501
01:45:21,715 --> 01:45:22,875
she may also fall in love.

1502
01:45:23,183 --> 01:45:24,548
Won't you fall in love?

1503
01:45:25,986 --> 01:45:27,351
Got blasted again.

1504
01:45:30,891 --> 01:45:31,619
Take it Madhu.

1505
01:45:33,460 --> 01:45:34,654
Madhu's parents know the matter.

1506
01:45:34,861 --> 01:45:35,919
They are searching for her
along with relatives.

1507
01:45:36,129 --> 01:45:39,428
Relatives...relatives...
l'll kill those relatives.

1508
01:45:39,633 --> 01:45:42,329
Parents will be fine.
but relatives add oil to the fire.

1509
01:45:42,536 --> 01:45:44,026
They say girl eloping is
dishonour to family.

1510
01:45:44,805 --> 01:45:46,272
What can they do sir?

1511
01:45:46,473 --> 01:45:48,634
Fill the tanks with gas and
roam around the place.

1512
01:45:48,809 --> 01:45:51,243
For a packet of biryani
and a bottle of liquor...

1513
01:45:52,846 --> 01:45:54,643
Sorry dear.

1514
01:45:57,517 --> 01:46:00,816
l think you don't have
anyone to advice you.

1515
01:46:02,155 --> 01:46:04,783
marriage isn't a small matter.
it's big responsibility.

1516
01:46:05,726 --> 01:46:07,387
How can you decide it so easily?

1517
01:46:08,362 --> 01:46:10,387
Who gives you so much courage?
- Friends!

1518
01:46:11,832 --> 01:46:15,290
Yes sir. without friends love marriages
in lndia is impossible.

1519
01:46:15,502 --> 01:46:17,561
Just if we say l may be in love
with a girl. that's enough.

1520
01:46:17,771 --> 01:46:19,033
they will confirm it as love.

1521
01:46:19,239 --> 01:46:20,297
they will crack jokes on my lover.

1522
01:46:20,507 --> 01:46:22,907
they will become villains.
but they will make me a hero.

1523
01:46:23,110 --> 01:46:26,136
lf we wish to go to a film.
they will buy four tickets.

1524
01:46:26,346 --> 01:46:29,645
they will give us two. two of them sit
on either side to guard us.

1525
01:46:30,016 --> 01:46:31,745
fearing the matter has leaked in home.

1526
01:46:31,952 --> 01:46:34,512
they will book a room.
and bring us to Arya Samaj.

1527
01:46:34,721 --> 01:46:37,918
here if anything goes wrong.
they will call media people.

1528
01:46:38,125 --> 01:46:40,958
media people would come.
Prem's love marriage.

1529
01:46:41,228 --> 01:46:44,254
watch it. keep watching it.
see it again and again.

1530
01:46:44,464 --> 01:46:45,658
we'll not accept until you see it.

1531
01:46:45,866 --> 01:46:48,391
they will keep on repeating it
till the cassette wears off.

1532
01:46:48,769 --> 01:46:51,260
We go public and parents get booked.

1533
01:46:51,471 --> 01:46:55,134
They will unite us but will never
tell them where we are.

1534
01:46:55,375 --> 01:46:57,104
That's friendship!

1535
01:46:58,512 --> 01:46:59,570
What does it mean?

1536
01:46:59,880 --> 01:47:02,041
l said it in a flow.

1537
01:47:02,616 --> 01:47:06,177
lf we thrash friends.
- Beat them. scold them.

1538
01:47:07,988 --> 01:47:11,924
Terrorists may sing
but friends will never.

1539
01:47:12,125 --> 01:47:15,117
lf they do...who is it?

1540
01:47:15,328 --> 01:47:18,161
Do you've a soul?
Will you elope with a girl?

1541
01:47:18,732 --> 01:47:21,428
You're dreaming here and
your parents would be crying there.

1542
01:47:22,235 --> 01:47:23,361
You can't understand it.

1543
01:47:24,137 --> 01:47:27,265
They would be struggling to save
their daughters from idiots like you.

1544
01:47:28,475 --> 01:47:29,601
Atleast you understand it.

1545
01:47:31,111 --> 01:47:33,375
What happened?
- They didn't come here also.

1546
01:47:33,580 --> 01:47:34,274

Oh God! Neelakantam is
no ordinary man!

1551
01:47:49,196 --> 01:47:53,826
Seeing his silly sentiments. l feel she'll
not love me in future lives also.

1552
01:47:54,034 --> 01:47:55,058
What will you do then?

1553
01:47:56,536 --> 01:47:58,060
To break father and
daughter relationship.

1554
01:47:58,271 --> 01:48:01,001
Babu was much better.

1555
01:48:01,208 --> 01:48:02,175
He broke relationship
after falling in love.

1556
01:48:02,375 --> 01:48:03,740
l'll break their relationship
to fall in love.

1557
01:48:04,544 --> 01:48:14,510


1558
01:48:18,191 --> 01:48:21,592
Don't keep your face so innocent.
l'm getting more impressed.

1559
01:48:21,795 --> 01:48:22,523
Go inside.

1560
01:48:23,129 --> 01:48:25,757
l'm telling you to go inside.
Go.

1561
01:48:25,966 --> 01:48:26,830
Take your hands off me.

1563
01:48:31,104 --> 01:48:31,798

1567
01:48:38,211 --> 01:48:42,944
Nothing sir. with her in tow. it's
embarrassing to ask about eloped girl.

1568
01:48:43,149 --> 01:48:45,276
let's go and search them.

1569
01:48:45,986 --> 01:48:47,476
Let's search. it may be embarrassing...

Where are we going first?
- To bus stand.

1573
01:49:01,902 --> 01:49:02,630
Why did you get in here?

1574
01:49:02,836 --> 01:49:05,327
You asked me to get in.
l thought you needed a guide...

1575
01:49:15,448 --> 01:49:17,245
Turn right from there!

1576
01:49:22,389 --> 01:49:23,754
Stop! Where are you rushing off?

1577
01:49:24,724 --> 01:49:26,385
This will not do...
Hey Auto!

1578
01:49:26,593 --> 01:49:29,562
Let's go to some place for few minutes
and come to an understanding.

1579
01:49:30,163 --> 01:49:31,562
Father!
- Father?

1580
01:49:31,765 --> 01:49:34,199
You don't need to feel great about
your country brute father.

1581
01:49:34,401 --> 01:49:36,335
for him all lovers are fools.

1582
01:49:37,504 --> 01:49:41,201
we are young. let's go out and
come to an understanding. come...

1583

lt's so hot.

1592
01:50:06,199 --> 01:50:08,030
She is too beautiful.

1593
01:50:08,802 --> 01:50:12,898
Village girl.
We won't get one in America too.

1594
01:50:13,707 --> 01:50:15,470

1595
01:50:15,675 --> 01:50:18,371
You have a wonderful taste.

1596
01:50:28,221 --> 01:50:29,449
Show me your face & talk.

1597
01:50:31,191 --> 01:50:32,453
How could you hit me for that?

1598
01:50:33,393 --> 01:50:36,385
lt's okay if you don't show it to me.
But don't show it to everyone.

1599
01:50:38,331 --> 01:50:39,389
l didn't understand.

1600
01:50:39,733 --> 01:50:41,724
lt's enough if the person
concerned understands.

1601
01:50:42,936 --> 01:50:45,063
Why have you stopped?

1602
01:50:45,305 --> 01:50:47,865
l'm dead tired.

1603
01:50:48,074 --> 01:50:49,063
l can't.

1604
01:50:50,310 --> 01:50:51,299
What's this?

You can go.

Meena...?

1623
01:52:02,582 --> 01:52:04,948
Did you see my daughter sitting here?
- Did you see a girl?

1624
01:52:09,022 --> 01:52:11,047
You separated them.
Now find her.

1625
01:52:17,731 --> 01:52:21,167
Oh no! One daughter is
giving so much trouble.

1626

Another will kill me l think so.

1627
01:52:26,973 --> 01:52:36,939


1628
01:52:58,605 --> 01:52:59,731
Why are you feeling shy?

1629
01:53:00,673 --> 01:53:01,469
Who are you. man?

1630
01:53:03,443 --> 01:53:04,137
Get out.

1631
01:53:05,311 --> 01:53:06,005
You guys get away from her.

Who are you?
- Get away from her.

1633

Get lost.

1638
01:54:35,401 --> 01:54:36,231
My dear Meena...

l'll slap you...
ls she a small girl?

1641
01:54:53,152 --> 01:54:54,551
Doesn't she know to follow us
wherever we go?

1642
01:54:56,022 --> 01:54:57,216
What if something had happened?

1643
01:54:58,758 --> 01:55:02,216
She made us worry.
- You stop.

1644
01:55:15,008 --> 01:55:17,670
l was selfish & l brought you to
the city for the sake of my love.

1645
01:55:18,344 --> 01:55:19,242
lt was all because of me...

1646
01:55:19,445 --> 01:55:22,312
Thank God. you understood.
Now will you leave me?

1647
01:55:23,049 --> 01:55:23,913
Leave you?

1648
01:55:24,450 --> 01:55:27,180
l said that l was responsible
for that mistake. Did l say l did it?

1649
01:55:27,787 --> 01:55:31,814
Once l love...impossible.

1650
01:55:32,392 --> 01:55:34,587
You don't understand
that l don't love you.

1651
01:55:34,794 --> 01:55:37,922
l don't understand why you love me.
- l understood.

1652
01:55:38,798 --> 01:55:41,926
When you went missing today.
l understood how much l love you.

1653
01:55:42,568 --> 01:55:44,263
lf you too love me
the same way...

1654
01:55:44,470 --> 01:55:45,994
You will take me away. right?
That's it.

1655
01:55:51,144 --> 01:55:55,205
That's it...?
ls eloping any easy job?

1656
01:55:55,815 --> 01:56:00,616
lf they get caught. they will be killed.
But for you. it sounds like a easy task.

1657
01:56:00,820 --> 01:56:03,516
ln your point of view.
what they did is a big mistake.

1658
01:56:04,157 --> 01:56:06,455
Your father might not understand this.
But you are in her age.

1659
01:56:06,759 --> 01:56:07,851
Atleast you should have understood.

1660
01:56:10,063 --> 01:56:12,224
You will understand
when you fall in love.

1661
01:56:25,678 --> 01:56:27,145
Still how long you will run with them?

1662
01:56:28,514 --> 01:56:32,473
Till now my slippers got worn out.
Hereafter my legs will wear out.

1663
01:56:33,353 --> 01:56:37,414
Don't wait for my arrival.
Before l come back. tomatoes will rot.

1664
01:56:37,857 --> 01:56:39,654
You saw what happened. didn't you?

1665
01:56:39,859 --> 01:56:42,157
A big wrong act was averted.

1666
01:56:42,362 --> 01:56:45,991
lf he wasn't there.
Meena would've been in great danger.

1667
01:56:46,199 --> 01:56:46,995
Oh God!

1668
01:56:47,367 --> 01:56:53,499
lnstead of coming here like a herd.
someone should've stayed back in home.

1669
01:56:53,706 --> 01:56:54,832
Whom are you talking about?

1670
01:56:55,375 --> 01:56:58,674
l mean these idiots.
ldiots fit for nothing.

1671
01:56:58,878 --> 01:57:00,345
They have come here to
achieve something big.

1672
01:57:00,546 --> 01:57:01,672
We are already in neck deep problems.

1673
01:57:01,881 --> 01:57:04,179
You guys could have stayed
with the girl. ldiots!

1674
01:57:04,384 --> 01:57:07,683
Even we are in neck deep problems.
Don'tjust blabber.

1675
01:57:07,887 --> 01:57:12,847
What? Will you teach me how to talk?
l will slap you.

1676
01:57:14,260 --> 01:57:16,023
Just because we take your beating.
you are beat us continuously.

1677
01:57:16,229 --> 01:57:18,857
We are in deep shit
trying to find your girl.

1678
01:57:19,399 --> 01:57:22,368
lf you dare to raise your hand at us.
we won't keep quiet.

1679
01:57:22,802 --> 01:57:25,464
Having come to my house.
will you hit me?

1680
01:57:25,738 --> 01:57:29,538
When it comes to beating.
place doesn't matter.

1681
01:57:30,910 --> 01:57:32,707
Why are you fighting?
- Please keep quiet. sir.

1682
01:57:32,912 --> 01:57:37,212
Stop it. Stop it sir.

Stop it sir. Stop it.
- Take your hands off.

1684
01:57:46,092 --> 01:57:48,560
What are you still waiting for?
Beat them to pulp.

1685
01:57:49,262 --> 01:57:52,254
You brought those idiots home
and they've dragged it this far.

1686
01:57:52,465 --> 01:57:53,864
Stop it.
- Why are you blaming me?

1687
01:57:55,034 --> 01:57:58,401
What is this noise?
What's happening here?

1688
01:58:00,206 --> 01:58:02,071
What did we come here for?
And what is happening here?

1689
01:58:03,709 --> 01:58:07,236
Forgive me. Please forgive me.
- Enough.

1690
01:58:08,481 --> 01:58:10,574
This is not the way to search.

1691
01:58:12,118 --> 01:58:14,678
l'll use my influence and
search for your daughter.

1692
01:58:15,054 --> 01:58:17,420
Once l find her. l will inform you.

1693
01:58:18,558 --> 01:58:19,991
You can leave. please.

1694
01:58:26,899 --> 01:58:30,266
Elope with her.
lt will teach them a lesson.

1695

Do that.

1696
01:58:32,805 --> 01:58:34,534
Shall l book rooms in the lodge?

1697

lf you don't mind.
we can go to my house.

1698
01:58:59,799 --> 01:59:01,630
Where did you go?
Where did you go?

My son knows this city well.
My son will help you find them.

1709
01:59:34,033 --> 01:59:36,661
lt was your son who helped
them to elope.

1710
01:59:36,869 --> 01:59:40,498
ls it? ls it true?
Earlier you helped them.

1711
01:59:40,740 --> 01:59:44,676
Now. you are helping these people.
You're too good son.

1712
01:59:44,810 --> 01:59:45,834
Very interesting.

1713
01:59:46,612 --> 01:59:47,670
You came to my house
on that day. right?

1714
01:59:47,847 --> 01:59:49,280
How could you take my son
away without any information?

1715
01:59:49,482 --> 01:59:50,380
No coffee for you.

1716
01:59:50,583 --> 01:59:53,211
Brother. feel at home.
You will find your daughter.

1717
01:59:53,419 --> 01:59:55,546
Because she didn't elope
with my son.

1718
01:59:55,755 --> 01:59:58,223
lf she had eloped with my son.
you could never catch him.

1719
01:59:58,424 --> 02:00:01,052
Because he was born with
wheels under his butt.

1720
02:00:01,260 --> 02:00:02,818
Mother...
- Shut up.

1721
02:00:04,630 --> 02:00:08,066
Actually you won't stay put
in a place for even 10 minutes.

1722
02:00:08,267 --> 02:00:11,293
But you stayed there
for 20 long days.

1723
02:00:11,604 --> 02:00:13,401
There must be something interesting.
What's the matter?

1724
02:00:15,942 --> 02:00:18,775
Just shut up & go inside.
Make other arrangements.- Okay.

1725
02:00:18,911 --> 02:00:19,605
Go.

1726
02:00:20,680 --> 02:00:21,647
You come with me dear.

1727
02:00:22,782 --> 02:00:26,081
He brought these pigs here.
- You are right.

1728
02:00:26,285 --> 02:00:28,253
l'll break their heads...
- Oh no!

1729
02:00:28,454 --> 02:00:30,183
l will crush their heads.

1730
02:00:31,457 --> 02:00:33,584
Make him sit down.
Put it there.

1731
02:00:34,994 --> 02:00:37,087
lnstead of eloping with her.
why did you bring her home?

1732
02:00:37,563 --> 02:00:39,861
She has to come here anyway.

1733
02:00:44,470 --> 02:00:45,334
She heard us.

1734
02:00:47,473 --> 02:00:57,439
SRI BALAJI

1735
02:01:10,296 --> 02:01:12,764
Mother...mother...

1736
02:01:13,966 --> 02:01:15,490
l thought this happens only in my house.
lt happens in your house too.

1737
02:01:15,701 --> 02:01:16,531
Why did you tie me again?

1738
02:01:16,802 --> 02:01:18,599
lt won't look good if someone
sees me like this.

1739
02:01:18,971 --> 02:01:19,938
Unchain me.

1740
02:01:22,975 --> 02:01:23,703
l can't.

1741
02:01:32,084 --> 02:01:34,314
lt's a new place.
How did you sleep?

1742
02:01:34,754 --> 02:01:35,812
Why are you chained?

1743
02:01:36,689 --> 02:01:39,487
So. you saw it?
She is scared.

1744
02:01:40,092 --> 02:01:43,323
l'm her only son.
l can't stay put in one place.

1745
02:01:43,529 --> 02:01:43,995
That's why...

1746
02:01:44,196 --> 02:01:46,824
Why don't you listen to your mother?
- l'm scared.

1747
02:01:47,366 --> 02:01:51,496
When l was a kid. l was playing here.
l came to know about my father's death.

1748
02:01:51,904 --> 02:01:56,068
Everyone was crying. l couldn't see
that sight. l really got scared.

1749
02:01:56,475 --> 02:01:57,601
l couldn't bear it. so l ran away.

1750
02:01:58,044 --> 02:02:01,844
Since then. l fear that if l stay put in
one place. some bad might happen.

1751
02:02:02,548 --> 02:02:03,515
l used to run away.

1752
02:02:03,716 --> 02:02:06,844
My mother used to tie me down.
l kept running away.

1753
02:02:07,653 --> 02:02:10,520
To forget fear & to find happiness.
l keep running.

1754
02:02:10,890 --> 02:02:14,690
l kept running for moment
which gave me happiness.

1755
02:02:14,894 --> 02:02:17,192
l kept running...
l kept running...

1756
02:02:17,730 --> 02:02:19,288
But l stopped for the first time...

1757
02:02:24,337 --> 02:02:25,361
...on seeing you.

1758
02:02:34,480 --> 02:02:36,311
l didn't find the need
to run anymore.

1759
02:02:36,982 --> 02:02:39,542
l don't know whether
it is love or not.

1760
02:02:42,254 --> 02:02:44,654
You give me so much joy
without your knowledge.

1761
02:02:45,157 --> 02:02:47,887
That's why l'm with you
even in such circumstances.

1762
02:02:49,762 --> 02:02:51,889
l can't leave you at any cost.

1763
02:02:54,266 --> 02:02:55,233
l won't leave you either.

1764
02:03:06,078 --> 02:03:13,143
How...?

1765
02:03:13,919 --> 02:03:21,052
How...?

1766
02:03:33,439 --> 02:03:37,341
How did you come to
my house & cast a spell?

1767
02:03:37,543 --> 02:03:41,172
How did you spark this
commotion in me?

1768
02:03:41,380 --> 02:03:45,248
How did you change my destiny?

1769
02:03:45,451 --> 02:03:50,514
How did you make me
follow your path?

1770
02:03:50,723 --> 02:03:57,856
How...? How...?

1771
02:03:58,297 --> 02:04:02,097
Dear. l wished for a girl like you...

1772
02:04:02,301 --> 02:04:05,930
Sweetheart. l kept my wish a secret...

1773
02:04:06,138 --> 02:04:09,938
Darling. l was waiting for you so long...

1774
02:04:10,142 --> 02:04:15,444
O girl. l saw you there...

1775
02:04:17,683 --> 02:04:27,649
SRI BALAJI

1776
02:04:50,916 --> 02:04:54,647
One day. god appeared
in my dream..

1777
02:04:54,854 --> 02:04:58,915
He sketched your face
on my heart...

1778
02:05:00,926 --> 02:05:04,657
He told me that you are
my life partner...

1779
02:05:04,864 --> 02:05:08,664
He kicked me to run for you...

1780
02:05:10,870 --> 02:05:14,499
l crossed mountains.
waterfalls. ponds. bridges...

1781
02:05:14,707 --> 02:05:19,735
...and fell at a place...
...a place near you....

1782
02:05:37,763 --> 02:05:47,729


1783
02:06:11,096 --> 02:06:14,725
My grandma told me
something long back...

1784
02:06:15,034 --> 02:06:18,731
She said that someone would
drag me to fall in love...

1785
02:06:21,006 --> 02:06:24,806
l called her an idiot...

1786
02:06:25,010 --> 02:06:28,741
But when you come infront of me.
l get stunned...

1787
02:06:30,849 --> 02:06:34,683
l wonder what would happen to me.
l wonder what wrong would l commit...

1788
02:06:34,887 --> 02:06:37,412
l stopped sleeping.
and starting thinking about you...

1789
02:06:37,623 --> 02:06:39,921
l adore you...

1790
02:06:44,396 --> 02:06:47,763
Like this...like this...

1791
02:06:51,003 --> 02:06:53,062
He made her think about him again.

1792
02:06:53,272 --> 02:06:54,967
He is no ordinary man.

1793
02:07:07,019 --> 02:07:10,580
l saw Hyderabad.- Get thrashed again.
you can see Mumbai also.

1794
02:07:14,860 --> 02:07:19,263
Let her not come with us.
Let her stay here. Come.

1795
02:07:24,036 --> 02:07:26,402
You go with them for today.
l'll stay here giving some excuses.

1796
02:07:27,039 --> 02:07:30,941
Meena is not saying anything.
l'll have to try harder.

1797
02:07:36,548 --> 02:07:37,412
Has everyone got into the car?

1798
02:07:38,050 --> 02:07:40,678
Sir...
- What?

1799
02:07:41,787 --> 02:07:46,690
Leave me for today.
l'll come with you from tomorrow.

1800
02:07:47,059 --> 02:07:49,186
Take them with you.
They know Hyderabad city very well.

1801
02:07:51,163 --> 02:07:55,361
l've lot of work to do at home.
l've to help my mother.

1802
02:07:55,567 --> 02:07:58,195
No need. Did l ask for your help?
You go with them.

1803
02:07:58,404 --> 02:08:00,201
Go.
- What are you saying?

1804
02:08:00,906 --> 02:08:02,703
You always say that
l don't stay put at home.

1805
02:08:02,908 --> 02:08:04,705
l love to help you...

1806
02:08:04,910 --> 02:08:07,378
l'm saying this because
l know about your love matter.

1807
02:08:07,579 --> 02:08:09,376
Go. Go.

1808
02:08:09,581 --> 02:08:11,549
Ask him alone to come with us.
- You come.

1809
02:08:12,251 --> 02:08:13,047
l'm coming.

1810
02:08:13,252 --> 02:08:16,710
She ruined my plans.
- Get inside the car.

1811
02:08:28,701 --> 02:08:30,566
Brother-in-law. that is the lodge.

1812
02:08:32,938 --> 02:08:42,904


1813
02:08:54,560 --> 02:08:56,585
They stayed in this lodge for 5 days.

1814
02:09:11,143 --> 02:09:14,772
They were inquiring about them.
- Who are you people?

1815
02:09:15,247 --> 02:09:17,044
Where are you from?
Are they your relatives?

1816
02:09:17,583 --> 02:09:19,107
l gave them room but they left
without paying the rent.

1817
02:09:19,318 --> 02:09:20,444
Give me money.

1818
02:09:21,987 --> 02:09:23,454
Move away!

1819
02:09:23,655 --> 02:09:26,624
You can't leave this place
without paying me.

1820
02:09:26,825 --> 02:09:29,191
Leave him.
Take your hands off.

1821
02:09:29,394 --> 02:09:30,122
What's your problem?

1822
02:09:30,329 --> 02:09:33,628
They asked for a room & l gave
them one without taking any advance.

1823
02:09:33,832 --> 02:09:36,630
They left without paying the rent.
Shouldn't l ask for money?

1824
02:09:37,269 --> 02:09:40,466
What are you talking?
Why would his daughter come here?

1825
02:09:40,672 --> 02:09:42,299
Do you know what you are talking?

1826
02:09:42,841 --> 02:09:44,968
Look at these photos.
lt was them.

1827
02:09:50,082 --> 02:09:51,276
Guntur

1828
02:09:51,416 --> 02:09:53,976
l'm Krishna speaking.
Where is our Babu?

1829
02:09:54,520 --> 02:09:59,981
My family members tried to convince
Subbalakshmi to back to home.

1830
02:10:00,192 --> 02:10:00,988
And they left.

1831
02:10:01,693 --> 02:10:04,491
Where are they now?
- Hyderabad.

1832
02:10:11,703 --> 02:10:12,670
Where are they now?

1833
02:10:14,206 --> 02:10:15,503
They are in Hyderabad.

1834
02:10:17,276 --> 02:10:18,243
What should we do now?

1835
02:10:20,946 --> 02:10:21,537
Where is your father?

1836
02:10:25,450 --> 02:10:27,975
Are you counting your days?
Watch out.

1837
02:10:28,787 --> 02:10:31,051
l'm not counting my days.

1838
02:10:36,862 --> 02:10:37,988
What is all this?

1839
02:10:38,864 --> 02:10:39,660
You...?

1840
02:10:41,767 --> 02:10:42,995
What was my mistake?

1841
02:10:44,369 --> 02:10:46,337
ls that a place where
my daughter should stay?

1842
02:10:47,639 --> 02:10:51,166
l wanted to send her to a place
where she can live happily.

1843
02:10:54,313 --> 02:10:56,679
But we can't even see that place.

1844
02:11:01,653 --> 02:11:03,177
No father can bear this sight.

1845
02:11:05,824 --> 02:11:06,688
Do you know something?

1846
02:11:08,794 --> 02:11:14,596
22 years ago. l was arrogant. a rogue.

1847
02:11:16,568 --> 02:11:19,093
Neither marriage nor my wife
could bring a change in me.

1848
02:11:20,672 --> 02:11:21,969
l had a daughter.

1849
02:11:23,742 --> 02:11:24,709
Subbalakshmi.

1850
02:11:27,479 --> 02:11:30,312
l took her into my hands
very carefully.

1851
02:11:33,352 --> 02:11:35,445
l wanted to take good care of her.

1852
02:11:37,122 --> 02:11:38,555
l changed completely.

1853
02:11:43,428 --> 02:11:46,659
l wanted to earn money.
l earned.

1854
02:11:47,933 --> 02:11:54,805
l earned name. fame. respect.
wealth & everything.

1855
02:11:56,909 --> 02:11:59,070
l became benevolent and
got all relatives closer to me.

1856
02:11:59,278 --> 02:12:00,245
do you know why?

1857
02:12:02,915 --> 02:12:04,246
lf something happens to me.

1858
02:12:05,284 --> 02:12:07,343
all those things l've earned
would protect my daughters.

1859
02:12:10,222 --> 02:12:12,918
But someone came in the
middle took her away from me.

1860
02:12:18,096 --> 02:12:19,427
Do you call this love?

1861
02:12:21,199 --> 02:12:25,829
There won't be money in the pocket.
But they elope with a girl.

1862
02:12:27,139 --> 02:12:30,506
And friends do all the help.

1863
02:12:32,077 --> 02:12:33,840
You feel yourself a hero
by helping them.

1864
02:12:35,480 --> 02:12:38,847
You have sent them somewhere.
And yourjob is done.

1865
02:12:40,485 --> 02:12:42,112
But she is still my daughter.

1866
02:12:43,422 --> 02:12:45,947
l want my daughter.
Tell me. where is she?

1867
02:12:46,992 --> 02:12:48,892
l want my daughter.
Where is she?

1868
02:12:49,428 --> 02:12:53,626
l want my daughter.
Where is she? My daughter...

1869
02:13:02,240 --> 02:13:04,037
Giving birth to a daughter.
bringing them up.

1870
02:13:04,943 --> 02:13:06,069
performing their marriage.

1871
02:13:08,180 --> 02:13:11,479
fulfilling all the responsibilities
of a father.

1872
02:13:12,117 --> 02:13:14,483
that last moment makes
every father proud.

1873
02:13:17,522 --> 02:13:18,819
You won't understand.

1874
02:13:20,926 --> 02:13:23,827
l love my honour. respect...
l lost everything.

1875
02:13:24,029 --> 02:13:26,998
l lost my 22 years of life.
But l still don't worry.

1876
02:13:28,533 --> 02:13:35,996
l want my daughter back.
l want my daughter back.

1877
02:13:41,380 --> 02:13:51,517
l came here. l searched for her.
l searched everywhere.

1878
02:13:53,225 --> 02:13:59,687
A glimmer of hope that l would
get back my Subbalakshmi.

1879
02:14:09,908 --> 02:14:13,207
We are looking for her everywhere.
But we haven't found them yet.

1880
02:14:15,647 --> 02:14:19,378
We are very tensed.
You don't worry.

1881
02:14:23,255 --> 02:14:25,052
We will come back with her.

1882
02:14:30,429 --> 02:14:32,158
Will they be found?

1883
02:14:41,873 --> 02:14:42,567
l don't know.

1884
02:14:47,879 --> 02:14:54,250
ls falling in love a big crime?
But why did they do this?

1885
02:14:55,520 --> 02:14:57,317
Will we get the courage
if we fall in love?

1886
02:14:59,958 --> 02:15:02,654
You love me. don't you?
Don't you know that?

1887
02:15:04,329 --> 02:15:14,295


1888
02:15:18,877 --> 02:15:27,285
Subbalakshmi... dear...stop.
Dear...

1889
02:15:40,732 --> 02:15:47,467

1891
02:16:11,696 --> 02:16:12,663
Stop them.

1892
02:16:13,865 --> 02:16:16,390
Catch him. Come.

1893
02:16:29,181 --> 02:16:30,443
Kill him.

1894
02:16:32,217 --> 02:16:33,081
Leave him.

1895
02:16:35,453 --> 02:16:58,072
Stop it. Stop it.
- Move away.

1896
02:16:58,243 --> 02:17:00,040
l will kill you if you dare
to come closer.

1897
02:17:00,912 --> 02:17:02,539
Stop it. no sir.

1898
02:17:02,747 --> 02:17:09,380
Stop. l said no.
Listen to me.- Move.

1899
02:17:10,755 --> 02:17:13,383
l will tear your face.

1900
02:17:13,758 --> 02:17:15,726
You are getting overboard.
- Listen to me.

1901
02:17:30,775 --> 02:17:33,744
No...
- Get away.

1902
02:17:44,489 --> 02:17:46,286
Don't dare to hit him again. father.

1903
02:17:47,392 --> 02:17:48,290
l am telling you.

1904
02:17:48,660 --> 02:17:49,524
l don't care that you are my father.

1905
02:17:51,596 --> 02:17:54,565
What does it mean if l have
left you all behind?

1906
02:17:55,367 --> 02:17:56,527
Why are you after me?

1907
02:17:57,736 --> 02:18:00,204
What wrong did l do?
What wrong did l do?

1908
02:18:02,340 --> 02:18:06,299
Eloping with him...
falling in love...lsn't it wrong?

1909
02:18:06,511 --> 02:18:07,409
No it is not wrong.

1910
02:18:08,680 --> 02:18:11,478
l felt l will be happy with him.
So. l fell in love with him.

1911
02:18:12,050 --> 02:18:14,814
Would you agree if l had told you this?
You would not.

1912
02:18:15,453 --> 02:18:18,479
l can't live happily killing
my conscience.

1913
02:18:19,357 --> 02:18:20,551
That's why l came with him.

1914
02:18:22,861 --> 02:18:23,828
With him?

1915
02:18:25,297 --> 02:18:26,321
How?

1916
02:18:27,966 --> 02:18:28,728
l don't feel so.

1917
02:18:28,933 --> 02:18:32,061
But l do. Look at me.
Look how brave l am.

1918
02:18:32,304 --> 02:18:34,670
You don't need to worry about me.
Understood?

1919
02:18:36,041 --> 02:18:39,010
Meena. have l done any wrong?

1920
02:18:41,379 --> 02:18:43,347
lf you've understood. explain him.

1921
02:18:51,890 --> 02:18:53,755
l can't run anymore. father.

1922
02:18:54,159 --> 02:18:55,854
lf you want to kill. kill us both.

1923
02:18:57,162 --> 02:19:00,029
But if you try to separate us.
l will lodge a complaint with police.

1924
02:19:00,832 --> 02:19:01,696
What?

1925
02:19:04,002 --> 02:19:07,369
Lodge a complaint to the police?
Against him?

1926
02:19:07,806 --> 02:19:09,205
l walked out on him.

1927
02:19:09,741 --> 02:19:11,538
Why do you people chase us like dogs?

1928
02:19:11,743 --> 02:19:16,874
What did you say?
- Leave her.

1929
02:19:21,753 --> 02:19:27,316
Yes. l am a dog.
l am a dog.

1930
02:19:30,662 --> 02:19:36,658
l'm a father. l've been guarding
you both for the past 22 years.

1931
02:19:38,203 --> 02:19:39,670
l've got used to it.

1932
02:19:41,773 --> 02:19:45,231
When you went missing suddenly.
l felt hurt like a dog.

1933
02:19:47,379 --> 02:19:48,573
Forgive me.

1934
02:19:50,949 --> 02:19:52,416
l got worried. that's all.

1935
02:19:55,787 --> 02:19:56,754
l'll go away.

1936
02:19:57,555 --> 02:19:58,920
Don't file any case.

1937
02:20:00,125 --> 02:20:04,755
Let's go. Let's go.

1938
02:20:11,269 --> 02:20:11,860
Come here.

1939
02:20:14,072 --> 02:20:15,369
Heard what she said.

1940
02:20:18,209 --> 02:20:19,836
Can she talk to father like that?

1941
02:20:24,983 --> 02:20:30,944
Whether you like me or not.
you are still my daughter.

1942
02:20:34,893 --> 02:20:36,952
Today. he is important to you.

1943
02:20:39,731 --> 02:20:41,198
lf something bad happens to you.

1945
02:20:44,569 --> 02:20:46,196
That's why l'm leaving you here.

1946

Look how grand your marriage will be.

You can live happily with
your eyes closed.

1952
02:21:35,320 --> 02:21:36,184
Where is Krishna?

1953
02:21:44,762 --> 02:21:47,196
l troubled you. Forgive me.

1954
02:21:48,500 --> 02:21:49,967
lt's not because l am angry with you.

1955
02:21:50,935 --> 02:21:55,395
lt's because l love my daughter.
- l can understand.

1956
02:21:58,042 --> 02:21:59,634
Please come to my younger
daughter's marriage.

1957
02:22:07,685 --> 02:22:10,313
No hard feelings.

We are one. Don't worry. Bye.

''No hard feelings''. - Let's go

Bye Krishna.

1963
02:23:13,818 --> 02:23:23,784


1964
02:23:39,544 --> 02:23:49,943
Heart can't take this unbearable pain...
She's beyond my thoughts...

1965
02:23:50,321 --> 02:23:55,623
Lips have separated...
Stay with me all my life...

1966
02:23:55,994 --> 02:24:07,132
Live alone in this life...
Ending in silence...

1967
02:24:18,883 --> 02:24:28,849


1968
02:25:01,225 --> 02:25:06,356
You warned me not to live
in the world of dreams...

1969
02:25:06,564 --> 02:25:11,695
You stopped me from falling
into eternal coma...

1970
02:25:11,969 --> 02:25:17,202
Love. you exiled me from
the world of smile...

1971
02:25:17,408 --> 02:25:24,837
Why have you taken over me?
Are you the first ray of new dawn?

1972
02:25:24,982 --> 02:25:27,712
Are you asking my sacrifice?

1973
02:25:27,919 --> 02:25:32,879
Who am l to ask?
What am l to tell them?

1974
02:25:52,610 --> 02:25:58,173
Get up. Get up l say.
l'm telling you.

1975
02:26:00,785 --> 02:26:03,083
You fell in love. that's all.
ls that a crime?

1976
02:26:03,788 --> 02:26:08,748
You find happiness only with her.
Do anything for that.

1977
02:26:08,960 --> 02:26:10,325
Mother...
- Shut up.

1978
02:26:13,965 --> 02:26:17,093
You can't be like this.

1979
02:26:23,808 --> 02:26:26,106
What your mother said is true?

1980
02:26:26,477 --> 02:26:29,708
lnfront of everyone.
when Meena looked into your eyes.

1981
02:26:29,914 --> 02:26:31,108
even we felt her love for you.

1982
02:26:31,382 --> 02:26:32,679
Why didn't you feel her love?

1983
02:26:33,651 --> 02:26:38,611
You're not only killing love
but also yourself. No.

1984
02:26:40,091 --> 02:26:41,786
She is going to get married.

1985
02:26:42,093 --> 02:26:43,958
There is still time left for her marriage.
We will do something.

1986
02:26:44,829 --> 02:26:48,458
What can we do now?
Nothing.

1987
02:26:48,666 --> 02:26:49,633
Let us take her with us.

1988
02:26:51,769 --> 02:26:53,396
Yes. Yes.

1989
02:26:54,172 --> 02:26:54,968
lf we do that...

1990
02:26:55,506 --> 02:26:56,734
Just answer my simple question.

1991
02:26:56,941 --> 02:26:59,136
Can you live without her?
Can you?

1992
02:27:05,116 --> 02:27:06,708
Then you decide what has to be done.

1993
02:27:12,957 --> 02:27:14,254
Let's go to her village.

1994
02:27:15,893 --> 02:27:19,260
Come here. where is Meena?
- l don't know.

1995
02:27:19,463 --> 02:27:22,432
Don't know? Careful. dear.

1996
02:27:22,633 --> 02:27:24,260
l don't know what to do.

1997
02:27:24,635 --> 02:27:27,433
Till now l was confident that nothing
would happen to me in this house.

1998
02:27:28,139 --> 02:27:30,607
But now for the first time.
l am scared.

1999
02:27:33,811 --> 02:27:36,439
When my father took me with him
without trusting me.

2000
02:27:36,881 --> 02:27:41,045
l had the trust on myself that l won't commit
the same mistake like my sister.

2001
02:27:41,552 --> 02:27:49,288
l won't love anyone.
But it's very tough not to fall in love.

2002
02:27:51,329 --> 02:27:55,527
l understood the reason why my sister left.
the moment the train left.

2003
02:27:56,334 --> 02:27:57,631
Don't feel sad. madam.

2004
02:28:09,113 --> 02:28:19,079


2005
02:28:34,372 --> 02:28:38,001
Boys from the city have arrived.
- Really?

2006
02:28:38,209 --> 02:28:39,733
Yes. l saw them just now.

2007
02:28:59,063 --> 02:29:02,521
Brother look. who is here?
- Greetings.

2008
02:29:03,467 --> 02:29:06,095
l'm happy that you've come
forgetting the bad past.

2009
02:29:07,805 --> 02:29:11,434
Till now you've seen only our angry side.
now we'll show our real hospitality.

2010
02:29:11,642 --> 02:29:13,610
We'll also show you.
what exactly we are.

2011
02:29:16,247 --> 02:29:18,147
Why are you standing still. brother?
Welcome them.

2012
02:29:18,516 --> 02:29:21,417
Why are you holding them here?
Take them in. please come in.

2013
02:29:21,619 --> 02:29:22,643
Please come in.

2014
02:29:33,864 --> 02:29:36,264
l never saw you before
so happy. madam.

2015
02:29:37,201 --> 02:29:40,500
He has come. l'm not worried
about marriage now.

2016
02:29:41,439 --> 02:29:42,667
Narsi. did you bring flowers?

2017
02:29:42,873 --> 02:29:44,932
Come here.
- Keep it inside.

2018
02:29:45,142 --> 02:29:46,336
Those boys...

02:29:48,546 --> 02:29:50,514
Nothing....l'll take care. you go.

2020
02:30:00,524 --> 02:30:02,651
Hey Krishna! Are you all fine?
- Fine.- Okay.

2021
02:30:14,538 --> 02:30:17,666
Where are you going so hurriedly?
- No sir...that is...

2022
02:30:17,875 --> 02:30:21,003
Where are your friends?
- They are there...don't know...

2023
02:30:21,212 --> 02:30:22,338
Are you searching for someone?

2024
02:30:23,147 --> 02:30:25,342
Actually. l was...
- You're free. right?

2025
02:30:26,817 --> 02:30:28,512
Come. let's sit and talk. Come.

2026
02:30:29,553 --> 02:30:30,679
Did you have breakfast. Krishna?

2027
02:30:30,955 --> 02:30:32,513
He'll have. you mind your work.

2028
02:30:33,557 --> 02:30:34,023
Come.

2029
02:30:41,832 --> 02:30:43,697
Come...let's sit.

2030
02:30:43,901 --> 02:30:47,462
Come. Sit.

2031
02:30:52,076 --> 02:30:54,704
ls your mother fine?
- She's fine sir.

2032
02:31:01,085 --> 02:31:04,145
l didn't expect you'll come...
you dropped in without intimation.

2033
02:31:05,856 --> 02:31:09,155
Look busy marriage arrangements...
everyone's busy...

2034
02:31:11,829 --> 02:31:13,729
l was the lone man free here
and l got company now.

2035
02:31:17,601 --> 02:31:18,727
Stay with me till marriage is over.

2036
02:31:25,409 --> 02:31:26,068
You will stay. won't you?

2037

2038
02:31:32,850 --> 02:31:35,478
Hey see if Krishna spoke with Meena.
- Okay.

Go.
- What's your plan?

2040
02:31:36,921 --> 02:31:38,821
The girl will be with us before
reaching the marriage hall.

2041
02:31:39,023 --> 02:31:40,991
l've kept ready four cars
on four sides of this village.

2042
02:31:43,527 --> 02:31:44,653
A car is ready for us too. right?

2043
02:31:45,863 --> 02:31:49,492
l'm searching for you all over the place.

2044
02:31:49,700 --> 02:31:53,500
Come and wear silk clothes.
- You go. l'll come.

Why are you in a hurry?
Can't you wear it leisurely?

2058
02:32:57,935 --> 02:32:59,061
l can't stop any more.

2059
02:33:03,874 --> 02:33:06,900

my father that l love you.

2060
02:33:07,111 --> 02:33:08,408
He knows everything.

2061

Oh my God!
What's our position now?

2062
02:33:12,449 --> 02:33:14,917
Their position is worse than ours.

Where's the man who planned all this?
We are in a fix. Find him.

2074

Why are you sitting here? lt's time for
offering prayers to Goddess Gowri.

Calm down.
- You go dear. Change the dress.

2082
02:35:32,523 --> 02:35:34,821
What's this brother?
Didn't you marry off us?

2083
02:35:35,025 --> 02:35:36,322
Are we not living happily?

2084
02:35:36,593 --> 02:35:43,999
She'll also be fine. you don't worry.
- Nothing happened. you go...go...

2085
02:35:49,573 --> 02:35:59,539
SRI BALAJI

2086
02:36:18,068 --> 02:36:23,199
Brother...guests are waiting for you.
Come brother.

2087
02:37:06,116 --> 02:37:07,811
Do you know what's going on
in my courtyard?

2088
02:37:10,120 --> 02:37:11,087
My daughter's marriage.

2089
02:37:13,524 --> 02:37:17,483
Earlier same situation. some guy
eloped with my elder daughter...

2090
02:37:20,130 --> 02:37:20,926
Now you...

2091
02:37:21,532 --> 02:37:22,760
Why did you come now?

2092
02:37:24,968 --> 02:37:28,870
ls it not to elope with my daughter?
Come out. isn't it to elope with her?

2093
02:37:29,072 --> 02:37:30,767
lt'll not take much time to elope.

2094
02:37:34,912 --> 02:37:36,106
l too wish it to happen.

2095
02:37:37,815 --> 02:37:42,184
l fell in love with your daughter in this
situation with that courage only.

2096
02:37:43,554 --> 02:37:46,614
When l saw you feeling sad following
your daughter's elopement.

2097
02:37:47,424 --> 02:37:48,220
it made me laugh.

2098
02:37:49,827 --> 02:37:54,958
But when l saw how much
it affects a father. seeing you...

2099
02:37:56,500 --> 02:37:57,398
it scared me...

2100
02:37:59,336 --> 02:38:00,803
l was never like this.

2101
02:38:01,839 --> 02:38:04,467
l was very happy even
in that dingy shed.

2102
02:38:05,442 --> 02:38:08,138
But l don't with whom
to share my sorrows.

2103
02:38:09,580 --> 02:38:11,639
l don't know who can understand it.

2104
02:38:13,116 --> 02:38:17,485
l gave a good thought. and decided
you're the best man to share it.

2105
02:38:19,189 --> 02:38:21,487
l thought only you can
understand my pain.

2106
02:38:23,026 --> 02:38:23,822
l came here.

2107
02:38:25,462 --> 02:38:27,327
Certainly not to elope
with your daughter.

2108
02:38:29,633 --> 02:38:31,999
l got worried without seeing
Meena for few minutes.

2109
02:38:33,136 --> 02:38:36,230
When l understood how much you'd worried
about your daughter for 20 days.

2110
02:38:37,140 --> 02:38:40,667
l know the pain. l can't do it.

2111
02:38:42,279 --> 02:38:43,109
l'll not do it.

2112
02:38:43,881 --> 02:38:50,445
But l don't know what course
my life will take hereafter.

2113
02:38:55,893 --> 02:38:57,690
Do you know what's going on
in your courtyard?

2114
02:39:02,165 --> 02:39:04,030
Marriage of the girl l love.

2115
02:39:08,171 --> 02:39:10,605
You're tensed about marriage
getting stopped.

2116
02:39:11,909 --> 02:39:14,639
l'm tensed about this marriage
happening peacefully.

2117
02:39:17,014 --> 02:39:19,039
You want to save your
daughter's marriage.

2118
02:39:19,917 --> 02:39:21,885
l want to save my love.

2119
02:39:23,086 --> 02:39:24,951
we both are in the same boat.

2120
02:39:26,423 --> 02:39:28,823
your love is protecting your
daughter all these days.

2121
02:39:30,260 --> 02:39:34,390
after you. only l love her that much.
try to understand it.

2122
02:39:53,383 --> 02:39:55,749
Stop...stop...
where are you going Krishna?

2123
02:39:55,953 --> 02:39:56,920
Where do we have to search for you?

2124
02:39:57,120 --> 02:40:00,920
Look there. Meena is waiting
for you. Go!

2125
02:40:09,633 --> 02:40:12,261
My sister left without telling
father about her love.

2126
02:40:12,469 --> 02:40:13,436
that was sister's mistake.

2127
02:40:13,971 --> 02:40:16,531
my father knows our love.
yet he's forcing this marriage on me.

2128
02:40:16,740 --> 02:40:17,764
that's father's mistake.

2129
02:40:18,408 --> 02:40:21,775
What we are doing is not a mistake?
Come.

2130
02:40:22,412 --> 02:40:23,276
There's a mistake.

2131
02:40:29,486 --> 02:40:34,947
l came here to tell your father about
our pain only. not to elope with you.

2132
02:40:37,394 --> 02:40:43,958
l told him. he didn't understand it.
we have the right to love.

2133
02:40:46,837 --> 02:40:48,566
we don't have the right to elope.

2134
02:40:50,674 --> 02:40:55,805
your people have had enough of trouble.
l don't want them to face it again.

2135
02:40:57,280 --> 02:40:58,474
separation is pain.

2136
02:41:05,288 --> 02:41:06,152
let's endure it.

2137
02:41:20,637 --> 02:41:22,502
Yes sister-in-law.
- Priest wants Meena here.

2138
02:41:26,777 --> 02:41:28,677
Bring Meena.
- Okay

2139
02:41:43,660 --> 02:41:45,252
Why are you staring at me?

2140
02:41:46,730 --> 02:41:49,699
You take so many precautions
when l'm with you.

2141
02:41:50,233 --> 02:41:52,201
you're sending me to a place
where you'll not be there.

2142
02:41:52,402 --> 02:41:53,960
you would've given
a good thought.

2143
02:41:57,574 --> 02:42:03,035
You gave it to me. father.
l can see my entire life.

2144
02:42:05,248 --> 02:42:06,806
l'll live it with shut eyes.

2145
02:42:16,326 --> 02:42:17,293
What happened to you?

2146
02:42:18,695 --> 02:42:19,889
You took so much for a friend's love.

2147
02:42:20,263 --> 02:42:21,389
Why did you give up
your love so easily?

2148
02:42:22,432 --> 02:42:24,127
We are ready to give
lives also for you.

2149
02:42:26,269 --> 02:42:29,067
We are ready to do
anything for a friend.

2150
02:42:30,173 --> 02:42:32,903
in that sentiment l committed
a mistake.

2151
02:42:34,377 --> 02:42:36,743
l don't want anyone of you committing
the same mistake for me.

2152
02:42:40,283 --> 02:42:42,683
come. let's go...come.

2153
02:43:01,238 --> 02:43:06,198
l still can't understand how my
daughter can live with you?

2154
02:43:07,544 --> 02:43:08,943
But l know one thing.

2155
02:43:11,047 --> 02:43:12,537
she'll be happy with you.

2156
02:43:14,284 --> 02:43:16,548
l'm here to protect if she
faces any difficulty.

2157
02:43:18,088 --> 02:43:20,955
but she needs you
to be happy in life.

2158
02:43:22,492 --> 02:43:27,361
l could understand this.
but many may not understand here.

2159
02:43:28,265 --> 02:43:30,790
they left. l don't mind.

2160
02:43:31,334 --> 02:43:33,234
my daughter is above everything else.

2161
02:43:34,504 --> 02:43:38,235
go. take my daughter.

2162
02:43:38,942 --> 02:43:39,465
Go!

2163
02:43:55,692 --> 02:43:58,320
Say yes. let's bring back
elder daughter too.
