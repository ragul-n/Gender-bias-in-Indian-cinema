1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,633
Run, Mintu. Run.

2
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,267
How did this happen, Kamal?

3
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,500
Who did this to you?

4
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,100
Shut your ears, woman.

5
00:00:50,533 --> 00:00:54,267
Better keep mum, bastard.
Or I'll break your leg too.

6
00:00:55,733 --> 00:00:58,367
You're free now. Let's go.

7
00:01:05,133 --> 00:01:06,700
- Shyamu is here.

8
00:01:26,633 --> 00:01:29,333
Stop staring. Take your notebooks out.

9
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,633
My dear Kamal.

10
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,633
Who does your homework?

11
00:01:44,767 --> 00:01:46,033
Ma.

12
00:01:46,167 --> 00:01:47,733
Who feeds you?

13
00:01:48,067 --> 00:01:49,067
Ma.

14
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,767
And who wipes your ass?

15
00:01:51,733 --> 00:01:53,767
Shaktiman, Mintu.

16
00:01:54,533 --> 00:01:56,333
The decision is yours.

17
00:01:57,267 --> 00:01:59,233
Either do his homework, or wipe his ass.

18
00:02:02,533 --> 00:02:04,067
Now choose.

19
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:06,767
Can I have a minute?

20
00:02:21,667 --> 00:02:23,033
And then?
- Then..

21
00:02:23,567 --> 00:02:25,400
- I just held the snake,

22
00:02:25,533 --> 00:02:26,767
- swung it around

23
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,333
and threw it far away.

24
00:02:28,467 --> 00:02:31,067
If you are so brave,
why did you scoot the other day?

25
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,533
I had gone to fetch your Mother.

26
00:02:33,667 --> 00:02:35,467
Don't you trust me? Time-out.

27
00:02:37,367 --> 00:02:39,700
All right. I panicked.

28
00:02:40,233 --> 00:02:42,167
I thought you were dead.

29
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,533
Fine. From now on,
you both do my homework.

30
00:02:44,667 --> 00:02:46,667
Yuck, I'd rather wipe your ass.

31
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,733
Enjoy his ass! I'll do his homework.

32
00:02:50,667 --> 00:02:52,533
Here, take a bite.

33
00:02:54,567 --> 00:02:55,567
Here.

34
00:02:57,033 --> 00:02:59,200
Enjoy his ass!

35
00:03:00,667 --> 00:03:04,200
THE WRETCHED

36
00:03:25,033 --> 00:03:26,333
Easy.

37
00:03:48,267 --> 00:03:50,000
Careful.

38
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,033
I'll be back for duty in the morning.

39
00:04:53,633 --> 00:04:55,633
Sir, it's my birthday.

40
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,167
Happy Birthday.

41
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,433
Sandhya.
- Yes, sir.

42
00:05:02,167 --> 00:05:04,633
I'm applying for Sunita's voter ID.

43
00:05:04,767 --> 00:05:06,633
I would need an NOC for that.

44
00:05:06,767 --> 00:05:08,500
Could you speak to your father about it?

45
00:05:08,633 --> 00:05:10,467
Sure, sir. Papa is home till 9:30 a.m.

46
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,200
You can come over.

47
00:05:13,567 --> 00:05:16,133
What day is it today?
- Sir, Wednesday.

48
00:05:16,267 --> 00:05:17,633
Okay.

49
00:05:19,267 --> 00:05:21,667
<i>Just looking for timing.</i>
- Papa.

50
00:05:23,533 --> 00:05:25,467
<i>Just get two.</i>

51
00:05:40,567 --> 00:05:42,067
<i>Just beats the one man.</i>

52
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,533
<i>The other has to give up.</i>

53
00:05:44,033 --> 00:05:47,033
<i>Not got enough on it</i>
<i>to get to the boundary.</i>

54
00:05:47,167 --> 00:05:49,333
Papa, I'm leaving for school.

55
00:05:49,633 --> 00:05:51,000
Take the jeep.

56
00:05:56,667 --> 00:05:58,433
<i>It's 31 to 1.</i>

57
00:06:05,467 --> 00:06:08,733
Didn't I tell you?
I was right about them.

58
00:06:09,267 --> 00:06:11,467
They must've been up
to some hanky-panky.

59
00:06:12,067 --> 00:06:14,133
No wonder they're in the police jeep.

60
00:06:15,233 --> 00:06:17,133
Her father is a cop.

61
00:06:17,633 --> 00:06:19,633
He must have had them arrested.

62
00:06:25,233 --> 00:06:26,667
She's quite something.

63
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,333
Going around with a man twice her age.

64
00:06:30,233 --> 00:06:31,767
Couldn't she find someone better

65
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,667
than that Darky?

66
00:06:34,133 --> 00:06:38,333
And you can't even wipe
your own ass, Loverboy.

67
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,000
Can't see her.

68
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,767
"Fire must fear water."

69
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,000
What do you keep mumbling all the time?

70
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,667
Mintu.

71
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,767
Why are you here?

72
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,267
We needed to speak to you.

73
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,000
Me? Regarding what?

74
00:07:07,733 --> 00:07:10,267
Kamal left his book behind.

75
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,500
Go. Take it.

76
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:14,367
Go on.

77
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,333
May I have some water?

78
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,633
Go on. Tell her about them.

79
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,467
I will.

80
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,733
You worry about
the fake stories you made up.

81
00:07:29,067 --> 00:07:30,533
I'm not worried about anything.

82
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,100
I'm just worried for you.

83
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:46,467
Tell her if you wish.
But don't come crying to me later.

84
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:50,100
Believe in me and Sandhya will be yours.

85
00:08:24,267 --> 00:08:25,633
Blind fool.

86
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,000
What are you up to?

87
00:08:36,133 --> 00:08:37,767
It's all for you, silly.

88
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,367
Here's the plan.

89
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:44,400
Help her find her shoes,
and confess your feelings.

90
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,367
(a-b)^2 & (a+b)^2..

91
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,000
Solve this.

92
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,767
Why were you here this morning,
Mintu and Kamal?

93
00:08:55,667 --> 00:08:57,633
To get his notebook, sir.

94
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,267
Your arms may be broken.

95
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,300
But your head is still intact, right?

96
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,700
Show me your notebook.

97
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:13,233
Sir, (a-b)^2 is (a^2+ b^2-2ab).

98
00:09:13,367 --> 00:09:14,600
Very good.

99
00:09:14,733 --> 00:09:17,400
(a+b)^2 = a^2+ b^2+2ab.

100
00:09:17,533 --> 00:09:19,300
Very good, very good.

101
00:09:21,233 --> 00:09:23,400
- What's this, Mr. Aryabhatta?

102
00:09:24,633 --> 00:09:26,400
- Shaktiman, sit back.

103
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,767
- What is this?

104
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,500
- No homework?

105
00:09:30,767 --> 00:09:32,200
- Absolutely empty?

106
00:09:33,133 --> 00:09:35,367
If you fail your exams this time,

107
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,300
I will not be able to help you.

108
00:09:37,567 --> 00:09:39,567
It won't be my responsibility anymore.

109
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,767
- Solve this now.

110
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:48,767
8+ (18 / 6) - 2 equals?

111
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,300
Get that?

112
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,600
It's 9.

113
00:09:53,733 --> 00:09:55,200
- Shaktiman, sit back.

114
00:09:56,233 --> 00:09:58,133
Answer, Mr. Shaktiman.

115
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:02,700
9?
- No?

116
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:05,467
9.
- Correct.

117
00:10:06,167 --> 00:10:07,367
- Learn from him.

118
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,533
- He has been
in this superhero outfit forever.

119
00:10:09,667 --> 00:10:11,500
- It's so filthy, it stinks.

120
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,567
- But his mind is as fresh as a daisy.

121
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,333
Get out and kneel down.

122
00:10:16,633 --> 00:10:19,367
But, sir..
- Get out. Now.

123
00:10:21,667 --> 00:10:23,233
Very good, Shaktiman.

124
00:10:23,367 --> 00:10:25,100
You said, "ground."

125
00:10:25,233 --> 00:10:27,300
-Yes. Ground.
-Ground?

126
00:10:27,433 --> 00:10:29,400
-Reponsibility.
-Not, responsibility.

127
00:10:29,533 --> 00:10:31,733
Responsibility. Not, Collectorship.

128
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,200
Poor thing. She has no idea that she is

129
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:41,467
sharing the roof
with her husband's mistress.

130
00:10:42,533 --> 00:10:44,333
Darky is quite the player.

131
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,733
See how slyly he's teasing her.

132
00:10:48,067 --> 00:10:51,033
Look at how he's drooling over her.

133
00:10:51,167 --> 00:10:54,533
Let it be.
- Look how he's talking to her.

134
00:10:54,667 --> 00:10:57,100
Just look at them once.

135
00:10:57,233 --> 00:11:00,033
Have you seen my shoes?
- No, but they must be here.

136
00:11:00,167 --> 00:11:03,267
- You both need to focus
on your studies now.

137
00:11:03,733 --> 00:11:06,500
Mother won't take the exam for you.
You will.

138
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:10,033
Shyam, sir, I can't find my shoes.

139
00:11:11,467 --> 00:11:13,700
"O, beautiful lady,
don't you step out in the sun,

140
00:11:14,033 --> 00:11:15,700
the sun will turn your fair skin dark."

141
00:11:16,033 --> 00:11:17,400
Mr. Shaktiman, come here.

142
00:11:17,533 --> 00:11:19,733
Am I your dance teacher?
- Yes, sir.

143
00:11:20,067 --> 00:11:21,267
Yes, sir?
- Could you come inside now?

144
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,767
Just help her find her shoes.

145
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,067
What is happening out there ?
It's so loud.

146
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,567
- I took them off right here.
- Then they must be here.

147
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,600
- These ones?
- No.

148
00:11:30,567 --> 00:11:32,333
We saw a boy run that way.

149
00:11:32,467 --> 00:11:34,633
Didn't we, Kamal?

150
00:11:35,567 --> 00:11:37,200
This way.

151
00:11:44,167 --> 00:11:45,467
Here. Take them.

152
00:11:46,033 --> 00:11:48,500
Why?
- Wear these.

153
00:11:49,233 --> 00:11:50,733
What will you wear?

154
00:11:51,267 --> 00:11:53,067
I'll wear Mintu's.

155
00:11:53,633 --> 00:11:55,533
Keep walking.

156
00:11:55,667 --> 00:11:57,100
And what will Mintu wear?

157
00:11:57,233 --> 00:11:59,533
We must catch the thief.
- He likes walking barefoot.

158
00:11:59,667 --> 00:12:01,533
These are too big for me.

159
00:12:03,433 --> 00:12:05,233
Everyone has left.

160
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,400
Why would anyone take them?

161
00:12:07,533 --> 00:12:10,300
Must be some fool
who has nothing better to do.

162
00:12:10,433 --> 00:12:11,467
Sandhya!

163
00:12:12,167 --> 00:12:13,733
Sandhya! Take these!
- Yes, sir?

164
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:16,167
Did you find yours?
- No, sir.

165
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,133
Then wear these. Come here.

166
00:12:18,267 --> 00:12:21,067
You stay at the police colony, right?
- Yes. How do you know?

167
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,200
I found your shoes!
- Take these.

168
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:26,133
Sir, he found them.
- Must be some cheap brand.

169
00:12:26,267 --> 00:12:28,267
No, sir, they're mine.
- Okay.

170
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,033
Shyam, sir! Thank you!

171
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:33,767
Bye.

172
00:12:37,433 --> 00:12:40,333
Are you going somewhere?
- Yes.

173
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,633
When will you be back?

174
00:12:42,767 --> 00:12:44,567
I have to attend a court hearing
in the morning.

175
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,133
I'll be back tomorrow night.

176
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:51,600
If there's a change in plans,
I'll let you know.

177
00:12:53,167 --> 00:12:54,433
I'm going to bed.

178
00:12:54,567 --> 00:12:56,533
Good night.
- Good night.

179
00:12:56,667 --> 00:12:59,733
I will lock the door from outside.
Don't worry.

180
00:13:00,267 --> 00:13:01,633
Yeah, we gonna do that.

181
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:04,333
Yeah, very good idea.

182
00:13:04,467 --> 00:13:07,100
They liked it so much that....

183
00:15:17,433 --> 00:15:19,533
Don't come down half-dressed.

184
00:15:26,533 --> 00:15:28,000
Sandhya?

185
00:15:29,267 --> 00:15:30,733
Let me see.

186
00:15:33,667 --> 00:15:35,233
Give it to me.

187
00:15:40,633 --> 00:15:42,000
It hurts.

188
00:15:42,133 --> 00:15:43,467
It'll be fine.

189
00:15:44,033 --> 00:15:45,367
How did this happen?

190
00:15:46,267 --> 00:15:49,100
I went to switch the generator on.
I tripped and fell.

191
00:15:50,067 --> 00:15:52,500
I was scared, all alone at home.

192
00:15:53,133 --> 00:15:56,367
I don't know anybody else around.
So I came here.

193
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:03,233
What if your father calls at home?

194
00:16:03,367 --> 00:16:05,633
He's the one who told me to come here.

195
00:16:05,767 --> 00:16:07,600
He did?
- Yes.

196
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:10,300
It still hurts.
- Almost done.

197
00:16:14,567 --> 00:16:16,733
Go to bed now.

198
00:16:19,533 --> 00:16:22,033
Sorry for the trouble.

199
00:16:22,533 --> 00:16:25,033
Not at all. There.

200
00:16:29,033 --> 00:16:31,433
There's water, just in case.

201
00:18:59,233 --> 00:19:00,333
Are you awake?

202
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,467
Cover yourself.

203
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,467
Sleep comfortably.

204
00:19:17,467 --> 00:19:20,333
You'll catch a cold. Take this.

205
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,067
What if her father locked her up?

206
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,733
He should lock up Darky instead.

207
00:20:26,067 --> 00:20:27,367
Why are you so warped?

208
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,067
What if she is unwell?

209
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,133
Think about it. If she was unwell,

210
00:20:32,433 --> 00:20:33,700
why didn't Darky go to school?

211
00:20:34,033 --> 00:20:36,067
Did he fall ill as well?

212
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:40,033
Let's find out.
- Attack!

213
00:20:40,667 --> 00:20:45,300
Kamal, do you know her house?

214
00:20:50,033 --> 00:20:51,267
See that?

215
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,400
How truthful are your stories.

216
00:20:56,533 --> 00:20:58,167
Always.

217
00:21:05,433 --> 00:21:07,167
I'm going to school now.

218
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,400
I'll see you there.

219
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,000
It's locked.

220
00:21:25,467 --> 00:21:27,733
It's not, Mintu. Come back.

221
00:21:28,067 --> 00:21:30,533
Let's go there.

222
00:21:56,167 --> 00:21:57,633
Let's go.

223
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,167
Climb on.

224
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,600
Move your hand.

225
00:22:29,233 --> 00:22:31,133
What happened?

226
00:22:31,633 --> 00:22:33,233
Kamal, wait.

227
00:22:36,233 --> 00:22:38,133
Hey, where the hell are you going?

228
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:41,033
Kamal, stop running.

229
00:22:43,133 --> 00:22:44,533
Will you please stop running?

230
00:22:48,433 --> 00:22:50,167
- Where are you going?

231
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,267
Now tell me what happened.

232
00:22:53,567 --> 00:22:56,200
Remember, you said that..

233
00:22:57,233 --> 00:22:58,733
..when a boy and a girl

234
00:22:59,067 --> 00:23:01,333
see each other naked,

235
00:23:01,667 --> 00:23:03,733
they get married.

236
00:23:04,067 --> 00:23:07,633
You saw her naked already?
- Yes.

237
00:23:09,067 --> 00:23:11,333
Now you're definitely getting married.

238
00:23:11,467 --> 00:23:13,400
In fact, she's your wife already.

239
00:23:14,167 --> 00:23:17,400
Doesn't she have to see me naked too?

240
00:23:17,533 --> 00:23:19,167
But she must have! Every morning!

241
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:22,267
So have I. So has your mother.

242
00:23:23,067 --> 00:23:25,000
That's not the same thing.

243
00:23:25,133 --> 00:23:27,400
Naked means totally naked.

244
00:23:27,767 --> 00:23:30,100
There's only one way to make her yours.

245
00:23:30,233 --> 00:23:32,367
You'll have to be naked in front of her.

246
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,100
Then do something, Mintu.

247
00:23:34,233 --> 00:23:35,533
I will have to.

248
00:23:39,067 --> 00:23:40,733
- As Shakespeare says,

249
00:23:41,533 --> 00:23:44,233
- "The god of love is blind

250
00:23:44,367 --> 00:23:48,067
- he sees from the heart, not mind."

251
00:23:50,167 --> 00:23:51,633
Shyamu will thrash you.

252
00:23:52,433 --> 00:23:55,633
- "You should let money run after

253
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:58,433
- not you after money."

254
00:24:01,333 --> 00:24:04,233
Did you rob the whole town?

255
00:24:05,033 --> 00:24:06,700
- Tuition fees, sir.

256
00:24:08,133 --> 00:24:09,633
Step aside.

257
00:24:21,433 --> 00:24:23,633
Bloody thieves!

258
00:24:24,533 --> 00:24:27,067
- Mintu, my pants are slipping off.

259
00:24:27,433 --> 00:24:29,567
- My pocket is full, my pants will fall off.

260
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:36,633
- Let them fall off. That's the idea.

261
00:24:38,067 --> 00:24:41,133
When your pants fall,
Sandhya will see it all.

262
00:24:50,533 --> 00:24:52,633
- Mr. Shaktiman, may I?

263
00:24:54,733 --> 00:24:56,633
- Now hold your ears.

264
00:24:59,267 --> 00:25:01,633
2... 3... 4...

265
00:25:01,767 --> 00:25:05,533
What's this nonsense?
Go make some tea.

266
00:25:06,167 --> 00:25:07,667
Take out your books.

267
00:25:09,233 --> 00:25:12,367
So, what does "Shyam" mean?
- Sandhya.

268
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:15,000
- Shut up. You talk too much.

269
00:25:16,567 --> 00:25:18,267
Meet me alone.

270
00:25:19,167 --> 00:25:20,333
Solve it, solve it.

271
00:25:20,467 --> 00:25:24,600
We can't let Darky ruin our plan again.

272
00:25:27,033 --> 00:25:28,700
Are you with me on this?

273
00:25:30,433 --> 00:25:31,533
Kamal?

274
00:25:32,433 --> 00:25:34,533
How is your husband?

275
00:25:34,667 --> 00:25:36,100
He's fine.

276
00:25:37,367 --> 00:25:38,633
- All good?

277
00:25:39,433 --> 00:25:41,000
Invite me over sometime.

278
00:25:41,133 --> 00:25:42,433
Sure.

279
00:25:42,567 --> 00:25:45,433
And he won't mind?
- Not at all.

280
00:25:47,133 --> 00:25:49,100
- Or you want to go out sometime?

281
00:25:50,333 --> 00:25:51,567
Did you have your fill?

282
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,400
Wait. Easy.

283
00:25:53,533 --> 00:25:55,067
I'm getting down.

284
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,600
Careful.

285
00:25:59,533 --> 00:26:01,067
Do you see his bike?

286
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,433
Come up.

287
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,067
Not you. You look for the bike.

288
00:26:06,433 --> 00:26:08,600
- That's the one. There. Now deflate it.

289
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,367
Be quick.

290
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,100
Shyamu's here!

291
00:26:18,533 --> 00:26:19,667
Run, Shaktiman!

292
00:26:23,533 --> 00:26:24,667
Meddling with my bike.

293
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,733
It wasn't me. It was Kamal.

294
00:26:27,067 --> 00:26:29,400
Liar!
- I swear, I didn't do it.

295
00:26:29,533 --> 00:26:31,400
Come on. Fix it now.

296
00:26:31,533 --> 00:26:34,000
Then kneel down.

297
00:26:37,467 --> 00:26:39,100
I'll deal with you in class.

298
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,733
Come back! How dare you?

299
00:26:50,333 --> 00:26:52,200
Water?
- It's finished.

300
00:26:52,333 --> 00:26:55,000
Walk faster.
- No. Let's run.

301
00:26:55,567 --> 00:26:57,467
Hey? Archana?

302
00:27:10,133 --> 00:27:11,633
What's wrong?

303
00:27:13,633 --> 00:27:15,067
You lied to me.

304
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,467
You said you weren't intimate
with your wife.

305
00:27:20,533 --> 00:27:23,100
Why are you getting into all that?

306
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,467
You're not mature enough.

307
00:27:28,067 --> 00:27:29,433
- I'd rather be immature

308
00:27:29,567 --> 00:27:32,133
- than be like you all.

309
00:27:32,267 --> 00:27:34,233
- You lie to me.
Papa doesn't have time for me.

310
00:27:34,367 --> 00:27:36,000
- And Mum has left us.

311
00:27:36,367 --> 00:27:39,533
Adults have their reasons. But..

312
00:27:40,667 --> 00:27:43,267
..all I know is, you are adorable.

313
00:27:44,467 --> 00:27:46,567
She must be heartless.

314
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,067
But I'm not your mum.

315
00:27:50,733 --> 00:27:52,367
So who are you? Papa?

316
00:27:53,567 --> 00:27:56,333
Not him either.
- Then what?

317
00:28:02,333 --> 00:28:03,667
Don't like the food?

318
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,100
No.

319
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:06,533
It's fine.

320
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,133
How was your trip?

321
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:17,033
Legal procedures are usually long.
I'll have to go back on the 24th.

322
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,667
What's wrong?

323
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:24,067
That's it?

324
00:28:24,667 --> 00:28:26,067
I'm done.

325
00:28:40,067 --> 00:28:42,100
- I've spoken at work.

326
00:28:43,667 --> 00:28:46,167
- We're moving to the city next year.

327
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:50,533
- If you finish high school there,
it'll be easier for college admissions.

328
00:29:03,767 --> 00:29:05,633
- She didn't eat though.

329
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:10,000
No, I have some work in the afternoon.

330
00:29:10,133 --> 00:29:11,767
Just a second.

331
00:29:20,533 --> 00:29:22,367
No. I thought I heard something.

332
00:29:29,433 --> 00:29:31,200
Your father's uniform?

333
00:29:31,333 --> 00:29:32,600
Scary.

334
00:29:32,733 --> 00:29:34,267
- What if he shows up?

335
00:29:35,733 --> 00:29:37,400
- That's my room.

336
00:29:38,233 --> 00:29:40,133
Is this how you dress at home?

337
00:29:41,133 --> 00:29:42,367
- Papa bought it.

338
00:29:43,533 --> 00:29:45,533
You're so fair skinned.

339
00:29:49,633 --> 00:29:51,433
Your clothes?

340
00:29:56,033 --> 00:29:57,267
The scooter.

341
00:30:15,033 --> 00:30:17,100
Come on. Get me some water now.

342
00:30:25,633 --> 00:30:26,733
Give it to me.

343
00:30:27,733 --> 00:30:29,667
Get the whole bucket.

344
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,633
All of it?
- Yes.

345
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:36,700
It's heavy.

346
00:30:58,033 --> 00:31:00,033
- What was that?

347
00:31:02,033 --> 00:31:04,433
There's a firing range nearby.

348
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:05,700
Okay.

349
00:31:06,033 --> 00:31:07,300
I didn't know.

350
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,533
The scooter is fine.

351
00:31:10,667 --> 00:31:13,333
Just needs some overhauling.

352
00:31:13,767 --> 00:31:15,400
Must've been out of use.

353
00:31:15,533 --> 00:31:16,567
Will it work now?

354
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,500
Absolutely.

355
00:31:27,033 --> 00:31:28,267
It's awesome.

356
00:31:39,567 --> 00:31:42,567
Why are you giving me the keys?

357
00:31:43,533 --> 00:31:45,500
- It's yours now.
- You'll land me in trouble.

358
00:31:45,633 --> 00:31:47,767
You fixed it. So it's yours now.

359
00:31:52,167 --> 00:31:54,367
You know what Papa said?
- What?

360
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,467
- He wants me to finish
high school in the city.

361
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:00,767
He just wants you to have a good future.

362
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,567
Really?

363
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:06,367
Do you realize what this means?
- What?

364
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,533
I'll be sent away.

365
00:32:08,667 --> 00:32:11,300
So I'll ride all the way for you.

366
00:32:11,433 --> 00:32:13,400
- It's not funny, sir.

367
00:32:13,533 --> 00:32:16,033
- Why do you still call me "sir"?

368
00:32:16,733 --> 00:32:19,633
Should I call you Shyam
in front of your wife?

369
00:32:20,067 --> 00:32:21,133
Go ahead.
- Sure?

370
00:32:21,267 --> 00:32:22,500
No. I'm kidding.

371
00:32:22,633 --> 00:32:25,300
Let's go to her right away.

372
00:32:27,533 --> 00:32:29,700
Let's do it.
- No, no, no.

373
00:32:30,267 --> 00:32:32,133
I was just kidding.

374
00:32:34,133 --> 00:32:36,033
I don't like any of your students.

375
00:32:36,167 --> 00:32:38,067
Especially Sandhya.

376
00:32:40,133 --> 00:32:42,367
You were my student too.

377
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:45,000
That's why I don't like her.

378
00:32:45,133 --> 00:32:46,767
She's an outsider.

379
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,267
She has no friends here.

380
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,267
Her father is hardly around.
And she has no mother.

381
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,067
What's my mother's name?

382
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,733
Her name?
- Yes.

383
00:32:56,067 --> 00:32:58,533
Her name is Mrs. Garhwal.

384
00:32:58,667 --> 00:33:00,033
Her first name?

385
00:33:00,167 --> 00:33:02,200
We shouldn't call our elders
by their names.

386
00:33:02,333 --> 00:33:04,733
- Blackout. Just a minute.

387
00:33:06,733 --> 00:33:08,300
Don't leave. Come back.

388
00:33:08,433 --> 00:33:09,767
Forever looking for excuses.

389
00:33:15,033 --> 00:33:17,067
She really likes me.

390
00:33:17,367 --> 00:33:19,433
She's too smart for her age.

391
00:33:19,567 --> 00:33:23,000
She says I'm very handsome.

392
00:33:23,133 --> 00:33:24,500
I swear.

393
00:33:24,633 --> 00:33:27,167
Despite your dark skin?

394
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:30,233
She loves that too.

395
00:33:30,367 --> 00:33:33,167
She said, if I had a thick mustache,

396
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,500
she'd go crazy for me.

397
00:33:37,233 --> 00:33:40,567
So grow one and marry her. Spare me.

398
00:33:41,267 --> 00:33:43,533
I was just kidding.

399
00:33:44,067 --> 00:33:47,567
An empty mind is a devil's workshop.
- Why did you hit me so hard?

400
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:50,767
For doubting your husband.

401
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,733
Don't be naughty.

402
00:34:04,533 --> 00:34:06,300
There goes your bride.

403
00:34:06,433 --> 00:34:08,200
You should ask her to marry you.

404
00:34:21,533 --> 00:34:23,200
Sandhya, get up!

405
00:34:23,633 --> 00:34:25,267
Sandhya!

406
00:34:25,767 --> 00:34:28,267
Mintu, hold her.
- Sandhya!

407
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:31,200
Lift her.

408
00:34:31,533 --> 00:34:33,567
- Get her up.
- Sandhya.

409
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,033
Sandhya, get up.

410
00:34:39,667 --> 00:34:42,267
- It happened
due to menstrual bleeding.

411
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,167
- We have put her on drips now.

412
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:46,533
- We'll get the test reports tomorrow.

413
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:48,100
Are you new here?

414
00:34:48,233 --> 00:34:49,300
Yes, sir.

415
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,100
- Could you please wait outside?

416
00:34:52,667 --> 00:34:54,433
If you don't mind...

417
00:34:56,333 --> 00:34:57,433
Should I stay back?

418
00:34:57,567 --> 00:35:01,767
First let me tell her about us.

419
00:36:02,367 --> 00:36:04,133
I will speak to her father directly.

420
00:36:04,267 --> 00:36:05,300
About?

421
00:36:05,433 --> 00:36:07,167
The wedding.

422
00:36:07,733 --> 00:36:09,333
What wedding?

423
00:36:10,233 --> 00:36:12,533
Mine. With Sandhya.

424
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,333
Seriously?

425
00:36:23,567 --> 00:36:25,067
Dumbass.

426
00:36:25,533 --> 00:36:27,567
You think Darky will let that happen?

427
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:31,267
If he really loved her, he would
have visited her at the hospital.

428
00:36:32,567 --> 00:36:35,333
I think her father will let me marry her.

429
00:36:35,467 --> 00:36:37,433
- Marry who?
- Sandhya. Who else.

430
00:36:37,567 --> 00:36:39,567
Dream on!

431
00:36:43,733 --> 00:36:45,367
You're still a kid.

432
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:48,333
You don't know anything
about "mature love."

433
00:36:48,467 --> 00:36:51,167
That happens behind closed doors,
at night.

434
00:36:51,733 --> 00:36:55,500
What does Darky have that I don't?

435
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:59,533
You don't have the balls.

436
00:37:11,567 --> 00:37:13,033
I'm sorry I couldn't visit you
at the hospital.

437
00:37:13,167 --> 00:37:15,600
Your wife must be home.
How could you?

438
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:17,200
True.

439
00:37:19,367 --> 00:37:22,600
You haven't been able to focus
on your studies lately.

440
00:37:22,733 --> 00:37:23,733
So here.

441
00:37:24,067 --> 00:37:26,600
What is this?
- Questions for the final exams.

442
00:37:26,733 --> 00:37:28,333
I don't want them.

443
00:37:33,233 --> 00:37:35,233
Let me in at least.
- No, sir.

444
00:37:35,367 --> 00:37:37,033
Papa will be back any moment.

445
00:37:37,167 --> 00:37:40,633
Just for a while.
- No, sir. You need to go now. No.

446
00:37:45,433 --> 00:37:47,067
Are you upset with me?

447
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,533
Please leave.

448
00:38:00,533 --> 00:38:01,733
Easy.

449
00:38:02,433 --> 00:38:04,400
Let's hope her father isn't home.

450
00:38:04,533 --> 00:38:07,167
If he was, his jeep would be here.

451
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:10,300
- Nobody's home.
- I think so too.

452
00:38:10,433 --> 00:38:12,333
What are you both doing here?

453
00:38:15,333 --> 00:38:17,567
I wanted to talk to you.
- About what?

454
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,000
I am in love with you.

455
00:38:19,133 --> 00:38:23,267
If you love me too, meet me at 4,
wearing that green dress.

456
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,333
Kamal!

457
00:38:34,433 --> 00:38:37,100
You asked her to meet you here, right?

458
00:38:37,233 --> 00:38:39,233
I asked her to come at 4.

459
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,033
She'll be here. Wake up.

460
00:38:43,167 --> 00:38:45,167
- You're useless.

461
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:47,433
Where did you get
that shirt from anyway?

462
00:38:53,533 --> 00:38:55,567
Did you steal it?

463
00:39:00,467 --> 00:39:02,600
- Tell me!

464
00:39:51,667 --> 00:39:53,467
I've heard so much about you.

465
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,767
He's really proud of you.

466
00:40:10,633 --> 00:40:12,300
Neelu dropped you off last night.

467
00:40:12,433 --> 00:40:14,067
She left this for you.

468
00:40:15,167 --> 00:40:16,400
Who is she?

469
00:40:18,433 --> 00:40:19,733
A friend.

470
00:40:21,533 --> 00:40:23,300
It's the 24th today.

471
00:40:23,433 --> 00:40:26,067
Don't you have your court hearing?

472
00:40:28,333 --> 00:40:31,233
Neelu is a nice person.
She'll take care of you.

473
00:40:31,367 --> 00:40:33,133
I wanted to tell you about her.

474
00:40:33,267 --> 00:40:35,167
I was waiting for the right time.

475
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:38,400
We've been together for years.

476
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,233
I'm going to school.

477
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,533
I was waiting for you to be old enough.

478
00:40:43,667 --> 00:40:46,167
I'm taking the scooter.
- Sandhya.

479
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,200
Sandhya.

480
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,500
- Come here.

481
00:41:17,233 --> 00:41:20,533
Let's meet after school, at the windmill.

482
00:44:37,033 --> 00:44:39,600
- I need his help with the homework.

483
00:44:39,733 --> 00:44:41,533
- In the middle of the night?

484
00:44:42,133 --> 00:44:43,600
- Come back in the morning.

485
00:44:46,267 --> 00:44:49,033
What happened to you?
- Nothing. Just..

486
00:44:49,467 --> 00:44:54,233
She thinks she can show up
whenever she wants to.

487
00:44:54,367 --> 00:44:55,600
- What's wrong?

488
00:44:55,733 --> 00:44:58,200
Sandhya came to meet you.
I sent her home.

489
00:44:58,333 --> 00:45:00,567
She's really getting on my nerves now.

490
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:02,567
- She's lost her mind.

491
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,533
You did the right thing.

492
00:45:05,733 --> 00:45:07,333
- Move aside now.

493
00:45:08,167 --> 00:45:10,000
Why are you mad at me?

494
00:45:10,133 --> 00:45:12,000
Not you. At her.

495
00:45:12,133 --> 00:45:13,600
Pass me the pillow.

496
00:45:19,533 --> 00:45:22,200
Take it easy. Relax.

497
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,000
I am relaxed.

498
00:45:32,167 --> 00:45:33,467
Where do we meet today?

499
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:44,400
Wear a perfume when you come.
Hello, Mr. Tewari.

500
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:46,133
- Lunch?

501
00:45:53,233 --> 00:45:54,667
Please stop.

502
00:45:55,333 --> 00:45:56,667
You didn't come that day.

503
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,167
I waited for you.

504
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:01,467
If you ever stop me again,
I'll tell my father.

505
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,767
But I forgot to tell you where to meet.

506
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:15,100
Massage properly.

507
00:46:16,033 --> 00:46:17,267
A little harder.

508
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,133
Come on.

509
00:46:19,267 --> 00:46:23,433
Papa does it better.

510
00:46:23,567 --> 00:46:24,633
Am I your Father?

511
00:46:26,233 --> 00:46:28,000
You're not doing it properly.

512
00:46:28,667 --> 00:46:30,500
Am I here for this?

513
00:46:31,333 --> 00:46:32,500
Then what?

514
00:47:12,567 --> 00:47:15,333
- I should leave before your father returns.
- Wait.

515
00:47:15,467 --> 00:47:18,333
- Let me pull my pants up.

516
00:47:20,233 --> 00:47:22,200
- I'm leaving.
- He won't come back now.

517
00:47:25,633 --> 00:47:27,033
One moment.

518
00:47:27,433 --> 00:47:28,733
Get off me.

519
00:47:37,533 --> 00:47:39,233
See you later.

520
00:48:05,433 --> 00:48:07,733
Do you like the food?

521
00:48:13,233 --> 00:48:15,767
I was so tired of eating out.

522
00:48:16,267 --> 00:48:19,533
Don't be shy. Eat properly.

523
00:48:20,033 --> 00:48:22,467
No, no, no. I'm just enjoying the food.

524
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:24,267
How about Sandhya?

525
00:48:26,467 --> 00:48:28,000
She's been quiet all evening.

526
00:48:28,133 --> 00:48:30,200
Give her time.

527
00:48:30,333 --> 00:48:32,100
It's your first day here.

528
00:48:32,233 --> 00:48:34,000
She is very sweet.

529
00:48:35,067 --> 00:48:36,533
That she is.

530
00:48:38,033 --> 00:48:39,633
Have you locked the door?

531
00:48:39,767 --> 00:48:42,333
Now show me what you've got.

532
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:46,133
Get both your hands off.

533
00:48:48,033 --> 00:48:50,367
I said, both hands.

534
00:48:51,067 --> 00:48:53,000
Now lift your arm.

535
00:48:55,567 --> 00:48:57,333
All the way up.

536
00:48:58,167 --> 00:48:59,767
Perfect.

537
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:01,767
Now spread your legs.

538
00:49:03,033 --> 00:49:05,500
That's the widest you can go?

539
00:49:07,267 --> 00:49:10,067
Are you serious about Sandhya?

540
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:12,467
Then arms up and legs wide!

541
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:15,533
That's my boy.

542
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:22,667
Now smile.

543
00:49:25,533 --> 00:49:27,500
And now you're ready.

544
00:49:28,367 --> 00:49:31,300
Where will you get these developed?
- In the city.

545
00:49:31,433 --> 00:49:35,133
Once she sees this, she's all mine.

546
00:49:35,267 --> 00:49:36,633
- Will you come along?

547
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:39,067
Can't. Mother won't allow it.

548
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:50,667
Oh, darn it.

549
00:49:55,433 --> 00:49:57,067
You'll get me in trouble.

550
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:58,667
I need to talk to you urgently.

551
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,067
Not now.
- Meet me at the water tank.

552
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,067
Later.
- Now.

553
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:28,500
I missed my period.

554
00:50:30,467 --> 00:50:31,500
What?

555
00:50:31,633 --> 00:50:34,133
I didn't get it. That's all I had to say.

556
00:50:44,067 --> 00:50:46,033
I'll take you to the city to sort this.

557
00:50:47,067 --> 00:50:48,533
I'm not going anywhere.

558
00:51:04,533 --> 00:51:05,700
Come here.

559
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:07,700
Yes, sir?

560
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:10,467
You think you're Angelina Jolie?

561
00:51:10,733 --> 00:51:12,467
Undisciplined behavior.

562
00:51:14,533 --> 00:51:16,233
No discipline at all.

563
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,133
You too.

564
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:21,633
Shyam, sir! Please, Shyam, sir!

565
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:24,300
Get lost!

566
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:30,133
Angelina Jolie!

567
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:40,367
You shouldn't have done that.

568
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:42,767
This is unacceptable.

569
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:47,367
If their parents find out,
I'll be in big trouble.

570
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:49,467
You've left me with no choice.

571
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:52,567
I'll have to suspend you.

572
00:51:54,533 --> 00:51:56,167
Thank you, sir.

573
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:57,767
Remember to use ice.

574
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:40,133
Sit here.

575
00:54:40,267 --> 00:54:41,433
Go there.

576
00:54:41,733 --> 00:54:43,067
Name?

577
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,033
Sandhya.
- Sandhya Sharma.

578
00:54:45,167 --> 00:54:46,367
Age?

579
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:49,600
15..
- 15 days, 18 years.

580
00:54:50,133 --> 00:54:51,333
Okay.

581
00:54:52,067 --> 00:54:53,167
What's the problem?

582
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:54,733
The usual female problem.

583
00:54:55,067 --> 00:54:56,200
Didn't get your period?

584
00:54:56,333 --> 00:54:57,633
- When did you last?

585
00:54:57,767 --> 00:55:01,000
Last month. The 18th or 20th.
- All right.

586
00:55:02,133 --> 00:55:03,500
Neelu, give him the form.

587
00:55:04,333 --> 00:55:05,533
Here.

588
00:55:06,433 --> 00:55:09,633
- There are two ways to detect pregnancy.

589
00:55:09,767 --> 00:55:11,433
Whatever suits you best.

590
00:55:11,567 --> 00:55:16,100
Please wait outside and fill out this form.

591
00:55:16,233 --> 00:55:18,033
Meanwhile I'll run the tests.

592
00:55:18,167 --> 00:55:19,233
Okay.

593
00:55:19,367 --> 00:55:21,033
She is actually my sister-in-law.

594
00:55:21,167 --> 00:55:26,167
Her husband works in Delhi.

595
00:55:27,033 --> 00:55:29,100
So please do whatever is necessary.

596
00:55:29,233 --> 00:55:31,267
Fine. Please wait outside.

597
00:55:33,133 --> 00:55:35,433
Who is he?
- He's my brother-in-law.

598
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:37,767
Pen?

599
00:55:38,667 --> 00:55:40,100
- Where is your sister?

600
00:55:40,233 --> 00:55:42,300
- She should have come with you.

601
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:45,367
- Are you being forced into this?

602
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:49,033
Show me your ID.

603
00:55:49,167 --> 00:55:51,333
Doctor, she's from my neighborhood.

604
00:55:51,467 --> 00:55:52,667
She's been married for a year.

605
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,133
You know her?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

606
00:55:55,267 --> 00:55:56,667
All right then.

607
00:55:59,667 --> 00:56:01,167
Doctor.

608
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:06,233
Her period's delayed.
I don't think that she's pregnant.

609
00:56:06,367 --> 00:56:09,333
Still, wait till the report is confirmed.

610
00:56:14,467 --> 00:56:15,733
Thank you.

611
00:56:25,133 --> 00:56:28,333
We can talk about it, if you want to.

612
00:56:28,667 --> 00:56:30,067
All right?

613
00:56:42,233 --> 00:56:44,733
What will you tell Sunita?
Where were you?

614
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:47,667
I'll tell her,
I came to buy her a saree.

615
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:50,600
Where's the saree?

616
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:54,000
Where's Sunita?

617
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:59,500
Sunita's at home, but where's the saree?

618
00:57:01,767 --> 00:57:03,300
What's so funny?

619
00:57:10,733 --> 00:57:12,567
You were scared, weren't you?

620
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:14,533
Me?

621
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:17,633
Why would I be scared?

622
00:57:24,033 --> 00:57:26,167
I should have been scared instead.

623
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:29,000
You know who that nurse was?
- Who?

624
00:57:29,533 --> 00:57:31,133
Neelu.

625
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:34,100
Remember I told you about Neelu?

626
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:38,700
That was her. Have some.

627
00:57:39,033 --> 00:57:44,067
What if she tells your father?

628
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:45,467
She won't.

629
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:48,100
If she was going to tell,
she would have by now.

630
00:57:49,433 --> 00:57:51,167
I'm getting goose bumps.

631
00:57:52,267 --> 00:57:53,667
And you said you weren't scared.

632
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,100
Just.. sometimes..

633
00:57:58,100 --> 00:57:59,567
Have this.

634
00:58:00,567 --> 00:58:03,300
What's wrong? She won't tell.

635
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:11,033
Aren't you worried?

636
00:58:12,033 --> 00:58:14,067
"Love is not for the faint-hearted."

637
00:58:14,433 --> 00:58:15,700
"Love is not for the faint-hearted."

638
00:58:18,167 --> 00:58:19,567
Now eat.

639
00:59:00,767 --> 00:59:02,600
Can you go alone?

640
00:59:03,667 --> 00:59:04,700
Yes.

641
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,633
We need to talk.

642
00:59:17,633 --> 00:59:19,633
Let's end this here.

643
00:59:19,767 --> 00:59:25,067
I mean, let's just stick
to a student-teacher relationship.

644
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:27,067
Don't expect anything more.

645
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:31,167
The other thing is that I'm sorry.

646
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:32,633
But I'm a married man.

647
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:36,267
I have responsibilities.

648
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:40,000
And whatever happened between us..

649
00:59:40,733 --> 00:59:44,000
..obviously you won't tell anybody.
Neither will I.

650
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:48,633
More importantly,
you should focus on your studies.

651
00:59:49,167 --> 00:59:50,467
Your algebra is weak.

652
00:59:51,633 --> 00:59:53,433
Get over me.

653
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:57,033
All right.

654
00:59:57,367 --> 00:59:58,633
Sandhya.

655
01:00:01,067 --> 01:00:03,333
Let me go. Someone's watching.

656
01:00:36,167 --> 01:00:38,633
See this. I'm a genius.

657
01:00:41,733 --> 01:00:44,067
Now don't waste any time.

658
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:46,067
Or you'll lose her.

659
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:48,267
So when is the doctor coming back?

660
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:49,600
Don't know.

661
01:00:49,733 --> 01:00:53,700
We had to cancel all appointments.

662
01:00:55,233 --> 01:00:56,567
Let's see.

663
01:00:57,367 --> 01:00:59,100
What's the problem?

664
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:12,067
Greetings.

665
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:15,400
This is the boy who saved Sandhya.

666
01:01:15,533 --> 01:01:16,767
Of course. I was there.

667
01:01:18,033 --> 01:01:20,033
Where's your friend?
- At home.

668
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:23,367
So who accompanied you?
- I came alone.

669
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:25,167
Alone? Will you eat with us?

670
01:01:26,467 --> 01:01:28,000
Have something.

671
01:01:29,333 --> 01:01:30,667
Please join us.

672
01:01:42,333 --> 01:01:44,400
My transfer papers are in the process.

673
01:01:44,533 --> 01:01:47,000
It'll come through in 15 days.

674
01:01:48,667 --> 01:01:50,533
When are your exams over?

675
01:01:51,467 --> 01:01:53,733
Your exams start in a month?

676
01:01:54,567 --> 01:01:56,467
Should be over by May, right?

677
01:01:58,667 --> 01:02:00,367
Eat, son.

678
01:02:02,467 --> 01:02:04,000
Try this.

679
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:09,400
Something to drink? Like a Coke?

680
01:02:11,033 --> 01:02:12,567
A cold drink, please.

681
01:02:16,367 --> 01:02:18,067
Spoon.

682
01:02:19,233 --> 01:02:20,633
Tissue.

683
01:02:21,333 --> 01:02:23,400
There you go.

684
01:02:30,467 --> 01:02:32,767
I was at the water tank, drinking water.

685
01:02:33,100 --> 01:02:35,333
Shyam, sir, was also there.

686
01:02:36,067 --> 01:02:37,433
Then those girls came

687
01:02:38,133 --> 01:02:40,067
and started splashing water.

688
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:42,267
Some water splashed him.

689
01:02:43,567 --> 01:02:45,700
When he tried talking to them,

690
01:02:46,033 --> 01:02:47,233
they ran.

691
01:02:48,367 --> 01:02:49,667
Then what?

692
01:02:53,267 --> 01:02:57,533
When they ran, they tripped and fell.

693
01:02:57,667 --> 01:02:59,733
And got hurt by the fall.

694
01:03:00,067 --> 01:03:02,267
By the time he reached them,

695
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:04,300
they were already bleeding.

696
01:03:26,367 --> 01:03:28,033
Sir, may I leave now?

697
01:03:41,767 --> 01:03:43,433
Do you know what time it is?

698
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:46,767
I need to speak to Shyam, sir, urgently.

699
01:03:47,367 --> 01:03:49,667
Come back in the morning.

700
01:03:50,267 --> 01:03:52,100
But, Miss Sunita--!

701
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:58,300
Get up. Give me your shirt.

702
01:03:58,433 --> 01:04:00,667
It needs to be washed.
- Get lost.

703
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,033
- Move your feet.

704
01:04:03,167 --> 01:04:05,100
- Don't try to dominate me.

705
01:04:05,467 --> 01:04:06,667
Listen.

706
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:10,200
I want to see a doctor.

707
01:04:10,667 --> 01:04:13,433
Go ahead.
- We've been married for a while now.

708
01:04:13,567 --> 01:04:15,333
People are talking about it.

709
01:04:15,467 --> 01:04:17,400
We should have had a child by now.

710
01:04:17,533 --> 01:04:21,033
I'm sure you're fine.
I must be the problem.

711
01:04:21,167 --> 01:04:25,300
I don't earn enough to support a family.

712
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:46,333
Here.

713
01:04:48,067 --> 01:04:49,233
See?

714
01:04:55,267 --> 01:04:57,700
Give that back. This one's better.

715
01:04:59,767 --> 01:05:03,200
This one got the highest marks in Maths.

716
01:05:03,333 --> 01:05:05,167
Please forgive me.

717
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:06,767
That girl trapped me.

718
01:05:07,333 --> 01:05:09,767
I didn't tell you because
I was scared of losing you.

719
01:05:10,100 --> 01:05:12,367
- You're leaving me over a rumor?

720
01:05:13,733 --> 01:05:16,767
- This is why I didn't tell you anything.

721
01:05:17,100 --> 01:05:19,233
He's looking over here.

722
01:05:19,467 --> 01:05:21,200
This one got the highest marks in Maths.

723
01:05:21,333 --> 01:05:23,033
Run away!

724
01:05:23,167 --> 01:05:25,367
Not you.
- Get off me.

725
01:05:26,167 --> 01:05:28,200
Now Sunita exits.
And Sandhya enters.

726
01:05:28,333 --> 01:05:30,200
Just wait and see.

727
01:05:30,333 --> 01:05:32,167
Wait, Kamal.

728
01:05:34,467 --> 01:05:36,267
Why are you doing this to me?

729
01:05:43,633 --> 01:05:48,000
Fine. Pack as much as you want.

730
01:05:50,367 --> 01:05:51,533
All right?

731
01:05:56,667 --> 01:05:58,333
Where are you going?

732
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:01,033
Why are you going?

733
01:06:01,167 --> 01:06:04,100
You're leaving me?
For something so silly?

734
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:08,000
I'm your rightful husband.
You can't do this to me.

735
01:06:09,100 --> 01:06:10,567
Have you forgotten it all?

736
01:06:11,033 --> 01:06:13,233
I used to borrow money
just to take you out

737
01:06:14,067 --> 01:06:15,367
when I was broke.

738
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:17,733
How can you just walk out on me?

739
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:21,433
Fine. Leave. But I'm coming along.

740
01:06:21,767 --> 01:06:23,733
Wherever you go.

741
01:06:24,367 --> 01:06:27,567
Heaven or hell.
I'm coming with you.

742
01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:31,700
Just a moment.
Let me put on my pants.

743
01:06:32,333 --> 01:06:34,267
I have loved you so much.

744
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:36,033
Have you forgotten everything?

745
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:39,400
Used to feed you
by taking debts on my head.

746
01:06:39,533 --> 01:06:41,567
Hang on a minute.

747
01:06:42,133 --> 01:06:44,200
Just let me wear some pants.

748
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:46,300
Do you really want to leave?

749
01:06:46,433 --> 01:06:49,167
Then walk over my dead body.

750
01:06:49,567 --> 01:06:50,767
Go now.

751
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:52,733
How dare you walk out?

752
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:55,133
How dare you walk out on me?

753
01:06:55,267 --> 01:06:58,400
People are watching us,
what will they think?

754
01:06:58,533 --> 01:07:01,067
I am Shyam Tekchand.
I have a reputation to keep.

755
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:02,533
I'm a teacher.

756
01:07:02,667 --> 01:07:05,000
I come from a respectable family.

757
01:07:05,133 --> 01:07:06,167
Please understand.

758
01:07:06,300 --> 01:07:09,500
The neighbors must be listening.

759
01:07:10,067 --> 01:07:12,000
Have you no shame?

760
01:07:12,133 --> 01:07:14,233
Why are you making it a big deal?

761
01:07:14,367 --> 01:07:15,767
Wait, let me wear my pants.

762
01:07:16,100 --> 01:07:18,333
Stop. I'm serious.

763
01:07:19,067 --> 01:07:21,767
If you leave this time,
I won't take you back.

764
01:07:22,100 --> 01:07:24,100
Why are you blowing it out of proportion?

765
01:07:24,233 --> 01:07:25,633
Don't create a ruckus.

766
01:07:26,633 --> 01:07:28,467
Hello, how are you?

767
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:31,267
Her mother's unwell.
She's going to visit her.

768
01:07:32,333 --> 01:07:34,100
Have you lost it?

769
01:07:34,233 --> 01:07:36,300
Why are you creating a scene?

770
01:07:38,533 --> 01:07:40,333
Fuck off, bitch!

771
01:07:45,733 --> 01:07:47,567
Move back.

772
01:07:48,367 --> 01:07:49,600
Is he here?

773
01:08:30,533 --> 01:08:32,000
Sandhya.

774
01:08:36,067 --> 01:08:37,233
Come out.

775
01:08:40,633 --> 01:08:42,533
I'm leaving for school.

776
01:09:00,167 --> 01:09:01,333
Hurry.

777
01:09:01,767 --> 01:09:04,133
Let me sit first.

778
01:09:04,467 --> 01:09:06,067
Now hurry.

779
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:07,767
Faster

780
01:09:18,100 --> 01:09:20,500
Stop. Stop. Stop.
- Why?

781
01:09:20,633 --> 01:09:22,467
Turn around.
- But why?

782
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:24,200
Just do as I say.

783
01:09:24,667 --> 01:09:26,167
Sit properly.

784
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:31,300
Hurry up. Come on.

785
01:10:03,767 --> 01:10:05,600
Be careful.

786
01:10:05,733 --> 01:10:07,533
- Don't waste time.
- I'm your Superman.

787
01:10:07,667 --> 01:10:09,100
Let's go.

788
01:10:13,467 --> 01:10:15,367
Hungry?
- Yeah.

789
01:10:18,367 --> 01:10:21,067
No pickle?
- Let me check.

790
01:10:25,333 --> 01:10:27,033
Want some music?

791
01:10:30,300 --> 01:10:31,500
Having fun?

792
01:10:36,467 --> 01:10:38,767
Let's break open the bloody lock!

793
01:10:40,067 --> 01:10:41,433
It's tasty.
- Yummy.

794
01:10:42,167 --> 01:10:43,267
Look.

795
01:10:45,300 --> 01:10:46,567
My turn.

796
01:10:51,700 --> 01:10:53,500
This is so much fun.

797
01:11:11,567 --> 01:11:14,700
Do you know what you've done?
Do you know what you've done?

798
01:11:15,033 --> 01:11:16,767
Sunita left me.

799
01:11:17,433 --> 01:11:19,600
Didn't I tell you to get over me?

800
01:11:26,333 --> 01:11:29,700
I asked you to stay away. Didn't I?

801
01:11:30,733 --> 01:11:34,567
Who asked you to defend me
at the police station?

802
01:11:34,700 --> 01:11:38,400
Why couldn't you just tell the truth?

803
01:11:38,533 --> 01:11:40,133
Why did you lie?

804
01:11:40,267 --> 01:11:42,533
I did what I thought was right.
- What was right?

805
01:11:42,667 --> 01:11:44,567
So you just do as you please?

806
01:11:45,667 --> 01:11:49,300
I am not afraid of anybody.

807
01:11:50,667 --> 01:11:54,500
If you'd told the truth,
I could have at least hated you.

808
01:11:57,367 --> 01:12:00,167
- Miss Righteousness!

809
01:12:19,667 --> 01:12:21,633
What are you crying for now?

810
01:12:27,033 --> 01:12:28,600
What are these tears for?

811
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:46,200
Fine. I'm sorry.

812
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:49,200
Sorry, sorry.

813
01:12:59,467 --> 01:13:00,700
Let's go.

814
01:13:17,700 --> 01:13:19,067
Climb down.

815
01:13:21,633 --> 01:13:23,167
Hurry.

816
01:13:27,733 --> 01:13:29,133
Catch.

817
01:13:30,733 --> 01:13:32,233
Come quickly.

818
01:13:41,733 --> 01:13:43,533
Take this.

819
01:13:47,167 --> 01:13:48,567
Come on. Let's go.

820
01:13:51,167 --> 01:13:53,067
Let's run.

821
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:55,033
Let's run.

822
01:14:19,100 --> 01:14:20,200
Come on.

823
01:14:20,333 --> 01:14:22,200
I'm coming.

824
01:16:00,367 --> 01:16:02,033
You know something?

825
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:08,133
Both you and your father
have terrible taste.

826
01:16:20,667 --> 01:16:23,367
Of course the bitch came back.

827
01:16:30,767 --> 01:16:34,067
It's a bloody mess in here.
Like all this stuff comes free!

828
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:36,300
What's all this?

829
01:16:36,433 --> 01:16:40,300
Why don't you just burn
the house down?

830
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
What the hell do you want?

831
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:45,633
And what's this stench?

832
01:16:46,633 --> 01:16:48,367
Is this shit?

833
01:16:49,033 --> 01:16:50,733
Eat it.
- You've been shitting in here?

834
01:16:51,067 --> 01:16:53,100
Go and shit in the middle of the street.
Why don't you?

835
01:16:53,233 --> 01:16:55,167
People will look up to me even more.

836
01:16:55,300 --> 01:16:57,167
Eat shit.
- You're demented.

837
01:16:57,300 --> 01:16:59,533
You eat it. Suits you better.
- Shut up!

838
01:16:59,667 --> 01:17:02,333
Take your girlfriend's photo and leave.

839
01:17:04,533 --> 01:17:07,500
This.. When was this taken?

840
01:17:17,667 --> 01:17:19,467
What happened to your face?

841
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:23,467
Nothing major. She fell off the scooter.

842
01:17:24,700 --> 01:17:27,467
Go on. Be more careful.

843
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:49,667
So the question was..
- Sir, may I come in?

844
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,367
..to prove that ABCD is a parallelogram.

845
01:17:54,033 --> 01:17:55,167
- Where AB equals..

846
01:17:55,300 --> 01:17:57,100
Why is your face bruised,
Mr. Tekchand?

847
01:17:57,233 --> 01:18:00,133
- Get out. I fell off my bike.

848
01:18:00,267 --> 01:18:03,567
- So AB = 6 cm. DC = 4 cm.

849
01:18:03,700 --> 01:18:05,333
Keep it there.

850
01:18:08,233 --> 01:18:10,033
Then what would ABCD be?

851
01:18:10,167 --> 01:18:12,000
Put it on the top shelf.

852
01:18:12,733 --> 01:18:14,100
A simple question.

853
01:18:14,233 --> 01:18:17,133
And none of them could answer it.

854
01:18:40,233 --> 01:18:43,733
There he was,
tapping at the little switch in his hand..

855
01:18:44,067 --> 01:18:48,000
Drink this before it gets cold.

856
01:18:54,067 --> 01:18:56,100
So often his eyes would shut..

857
01:18:58,267 --> 01:18:59,467
What is this?

858
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:03,367
Get up. Get up.

859
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:08,767
Anyone else?

860
01:19:10,667 --> 01:19:12,367
Be careful.

861
01:19:12,500 --> 01:19:14,433
Careful with the crockery sets.

862
01:19:28,367 --> 01:19:32,067
I was also abandoned by my mother
when I was just a little girl.

863
01:19:35,433 --> 01:19:37,633
Father was always busy with work.

864
01:19:38,733 --> 01:19:43,167
Growing up was a lonely struggle.

865
01:19:46,233 --> 01:19:48,300
Then a boy came into my life.

866
01:19:50,633 --> 01:19:53,400
I thought he would never leave me.

867
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:57,267
That he would take care of me.

868
01:19:59,233 --> 01:20:00,533
No.

869
01:20:02,100 --> 01:20:03,700
He left me as well.

870
01:20:07,433 --> 01:20:11,100
After him, I sank into depression.

871
01:20:12,533 --> 01:20:14,700
Anti-depressants, medication..

872
01:20:16,633 --> 01:20:20,333
They made me sleep all the time.

873
01:20:23,433 --> 01:20:26,267
When I'd wake up, I'd be hungry.

874
01:20:28,533 --> 01:20:30,533
Because of all that,

875
01:20:32,467 --> 01:20:34,200
I put on so much weight.

876
01:20:46,567 --> 01:20:49,367
If I'd studied hard enough,

877
01:20:50,633 --> 01:20:52,500
I could have been a doctor.

878
01:20:56,733 --> 01:20:58,200
Anyway..

879
01:21:00,567 --> 01:21:02,567
That's history. All right.

880
01:21:02,700 --> 01:21:04,400
You get ready now.

881
01:21:05,233 --> 01:21:06,767
May I hug you?

882
01:21:07,567 --> 01:21:09,167
Of course, dear.

883
01:21:41,467 --> 01:21:44,267
- I have my doubts about those two brats.

884
01:21:44,667 --> 01:21:46,400
- What do you think?

885
01:21:47,167 --> 01:21:49,267
Who do you think did it?

886
01:21:53,167 --> 01:21:55,167
I can't find my slippers.

887
01:21:58,067 --> 01:22:00,533
And my new blue shirt is missing too.

888
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:13,600
Have you seen <i>The Incredible Hulk?</i>

889
01:23:00,733 --> 01:23:03,400
You've worn it properly, right?
It's about to rain.

890
01:23:03,533 --> 01:23:06,100
Sandhya is leaving soon.

891
01:23:08,667 --> 01:23:11,033
Come on. Hurry up.

892
01:23:44,733 --> 01:23:47,267
One day I had gone to see Cricket.

893
01:23:47,533 --> 01:23:49,367
I'm telling you the truth.

894
01:23:50,300 --> 01:23:52,433
It's Shyamu!

895
01:23:54,300 --> 01:23:56,267
Hey, Mintu!
- Kamal, run!

896
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:58,433
Stop right there!

897
01:24:11,067 --> 01:24:14,167
I'm going to catch you!

898
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:16,433
There, bastard.
