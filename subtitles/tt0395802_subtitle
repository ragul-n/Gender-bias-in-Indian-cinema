1
00:02:44,911 --> 00:02:46,902
Whose child is weeping?.

2
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,411
Who dumped the child
in this filth?

3
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,581
I wonder who left him here.

4
00:02:58,925 --> 00:03:00,916
An child born out of illicit sex
would end up in such places.

5
00:03:06,933 --> 00:03:08,924
Let's go away.

6
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,451
Remember to administer medicines
regularly to the child and mother.

7
00:03:37,797 --> 00:03:39,788
Constable! The madam is calling you.

8
00:03:47,474 --> 00:03:49,465
Go and pay this money.

9
00:03:51,478 --> 00:03:54,572
- You sent for me?
- A child was born to me last night.

10
00:03:56,483 --> 00:03:59,646
Congratulations.
- If a decent man like you...

11
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:02,483
puts the sacred Ganges
water in his mouth...

12
00:04:02,822 --> 00:04:04,813
...this child is sure to
grow up into a good man.

13
00:04:04,991 --> 00:04:07,983
I cannot expect a holy man
to walk into my house.

14
00:04:08,662 --> 00:04:10,653
He wouldn't come? Would he?

15
00:04:18,505 --> 00:04:21,668
- Open your mouth! Come on!
- You're a nice kid, aren't you?

16
00:04:22,842 --> 00:04:24,833
Drink it!

17
00:04:31,017 --> 00:04:33,008
Grow up to be a good human being.

18
00:04:34,521 --> 00:04:40,016
Will he grow up on the strength of
your affection...

19
00:04:41,861 --> 00:04:45,627
...or is there a father
to care for him?

20
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,191
Those who visit these brothels
have fathers of their own.

21
00:04:49,869 --> 00:04:51,860
But one who takes birth here
doesn't have a father.

22
00:04:52,872 --> 00:04:54,863
Such a child is
considered as sinful.

23
00:05:11,558 --> 00:05:17,053
A child in your arms!
- I found him in the gutters.

24
00:05:19,065 --> 00:05:23,900
I don't even know
where he came from.

25
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:26,903
Will you leave the infant
in some orphanage?

26
00:05:30,577 --> 00:05:35,412
Now that I've touched him,
where is he an orphan now?

27
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:38,574
Put some Ganges water
in his mouth too!

28
00:05:41,588 --> 00:05:43,579
I wonder if an infant who has seen
filth right from his birth...

29
00:05:43,657 --> 00:05:48,594
...will be able to get to
taste the sacred Ganges water?

30
00:05:51,931 --> 00:05:55,594
It's easy to embrace a stranger, but
very difficult to make him one's own.

31
00:05:56,102 --> 00:05:59,265
Did you ever consider if
your wife would accept him?

32
00:05:59,606 --> 00:06:01,597
Not at all!

33
00:06:02,108 --> 00:06:04,599
I can never accept this filth!

34
00:06:05,111 --> 00:06:07,602
You'd better go and dump him in the
ssme place where you picked him.

35
00:06:07,947 --> 00:06:09,778
How can I dump him just like that?

36
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:14,613
One doesn't kick away a living being
even if it's only an animal's child.

37
00:06:15,288 --> 00:06:18,121
You'll have to leave me forever.

38
00:06:19,292 --> 00:06:22,784
I wonder whose child it is.
Take care ofhim, if you like.

39
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:27,122
You'd better control yourseif.
You shouldn't lift weights.

40
00:06:27,634 --> 00:06:31,627
I'll find it tough to care for the
weight that you've brought home today.

41
00:06:32,972 --> 00:06:36,135
Look! Listen to me!

42
00:06:36,643 --> 00:06:38,634
Rven if you don't consider him as a
human being...

43
00:06:38,712 --> 00:06:41,146
...you should at least care for him
for the cause ofhumanity.

44
00:06:41,648 --> 00:06:43,809
He'll eat some food out of
whatever we can afford.

45
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:46,311
How'll you fend for your
own child?

46
00:06:47,153 --> 00:06:49,144
I'm pregnant now. If a boy is to be
born to us...

47
00:06:49,222 --> 00:06:51,213
...this child will try to snatch
the rights of our son.

48
00:06:51,324 --> 00:06:54,157
If a girl is born to us, this child
will force her into prostitution.

49
00:06:54,427 --> 00:06:56,418
I promise you...I promise you.

50
00:06:56,663 --> 00:06:58,153
Families cannot function on the
strength of promises.

51
00:06:58,665 --> 00:07:01,065
I assure you that I won't deprive
you of your rights...

52
00:07:01,167 --> 00:07:03,499
...neither will I let our own child
be harmed in any manner.

53
00:07:04,671 --> 00:07:06,662
Nobody brings up one's own child
along with a smake's child!

54
00:07:07,006 --> 00:07:08,997
My decision is final.

55
00:07:12,178 --> 00:07:14,510
You're leaving me in the presence
of the entire neighbourhood.

56
00:07:15,014 --> 00:07:17,175
You'd better consider it
as a separation for ever.

57
00:07:20,687 --> 00:07:25,351
Rven if I were to die, you need not
come and light my funeral pyre.

58
00:07:26,025 --> 00:07:28,016
Listen to what I've to say.

59
00:07:28,194 --> 00:07:32,028
If you get news of my death, you need
not come to see my dead body.

60
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,692
So now you expect this filth in your
hands as a replacement.

61
00:07:38,371 --> 00:07:42,535
If this is your last wish,
I'll definitely fulfill it.

62
00:07:47,213 --> 00:07:49,204
I'll definitely fulfill it.

63
00:07:54,053 --> 00:07:58,547
Friends! We'll not let
this bastard live here.

64
00:07:59,225 --> 00:08:02,717
Ifhe lives here, it would influence
our children adversely.

65
00:08:02,796 --> 00:08:04,559
- Come over!
- Leave me!

66
00:08:04,631 --> 00:08:08,226
- Come over, I say!
- Leave me!

67
00:08:10,737 --> 00:08:14,571
Take this 5 rupees! You went to
fetch a taxi for this, didn't you?

68
00:08:15,742 --> 00:08:18,905
What right do you have to instigate
people and break families?

69
00:08:19,412 --> 00:08:21,903
- Lay off!. Will you?
- Don't you shoo me away!

70
00:08:22,248 --> 00:08:24,910
If I go away, you'll find it
difficult to pay for your booze.

71
00:08:25,752 --> 00:08:30,246
You'd married me to provide for me.
But you're dependent on me now.

72
00:08:31,591 --> 00:08:36,927
If I keep quiet, it doesn't mean that
I don't know your source of earnings.

73
00:08:38,097 --> 00:08:40,088
Why're you all staring?.

74
00:08:41,434 --> 00:08:43,425
You couldn't become a father yourseif.

75
00:08:44,103 --> 00:08:46,264
But you want to deprive somebody
of their support.

76
00:08:47,774 --> 00:08:50,106
The almighty who has provided the mouth
will provide for food too.

77
00:08:50,777 --> 00:08:53,610
It's time for your bath now.

78
00:09:00,119 --> 00:09:03,953
You're my nice kid!
You're a good kid!

79
00:09:04,457 --> 00:09:07,620
My son will go to school today.

80
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:13,121
Do you know the
meaning of Ajay?

81
00:09:14,133 --> 00:09:18,297
Ajay means one who is invincible.

82
00:09:29,649 --> 00:09:30,638
Constable!

83
00:09:33,319 --> 00:09:36,311
My son didn't get admission on the
strength of my name alone.

84
00:09:39,826 --> 00:09:42,659
Would you agree to name yourseif
as my child's father?

85
00:09:43,496 --> 00:09:46,659
What'll you do by educating him?

86
00:09:48,501 --> 00:09:51,664
He'll receive education here.

87
00:09:53,506 --> 00:09:55,337
But how'll teach him etiquette
and culture?

88
00:09:56,342 --> 00:09:58,503
I stopped soliciting
the moment he was born.

89
00:09:59,512 --> 00:10:01,173
I've vacated all the brothels.

90
00:10:07,854 --> 00:10:09,685
What've you named your son?

91
00:10:13,059 --> 00:10:15,857
Rvery conceivable song is
rendered in your locality.

92
00:10:16,529 --> 00:10:18,360
Your son's name means hymns.

93
00:10:18,431 --> 00:10:20,365
That's something which is missing
in your locality.

94
00:10:24,537 --> 00:10:27,028
I'm looking at the beginning of
my golden future.

95
00:10:40,219 --> 00:10:44,713
Soul can neither be cut by weapons,
nor can it be burnt by fire.

96
00:10:45,391 --> 00:10:48,485
Neither can water wet the soul, nor
can air dry it.

97
00:10:48,561 --> 00:10:52,395
Ajay learnt about etiquette at home,
but at school, both were condemned.

98
00:10:55,735 --> 00:10:58,397
My parents told me that both of them
are street urchins.

99
00:11:02,408 --> 00:11:07,072
They experienced hatred and rejection.
They prayed for acceptance and love.

100
00:11:07,914 --> 00:11:09,905
But they continued to
bear with insults.

101
00:11:09,983 --> 00:11:12,247
You're scoundrels!

102
00:11:14,921 --> 00:11:21,258
Ajay took to the path where nobody
asked him his father's name.

103
00:11:25,431 --> 00:11:28,594
Ajay took to playing cards.
Soon both the kids became adults.

104
00:11:29,435 --> 00:11:32,927
There's still fifteen minutes for
the exam duration to end.

105
00:11:33,606 --> 00:11:36,598
You could've revised.
- I've already revised my studies.

106
00:11:41,047 --> 00:11:43,607
- Give it to me.
- How can you do that?

107
00:12:09,976 --> 00:12:13,139
- How was your final paper?
- As usual.

108
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:17,472
Since we're going steady,
I've suffered in my studies.

109
00:12:17,984 --> 00:12:21,818
- Love is as tough as any exam.
- You've passed the exams oflove.

110
00:12:23,656 --> 00:12:25,647
Tell me, once you complete
the course will you start...

111
00:12:25,725 --> 00:12:27,716
a business, or would you
settle for a job?

112
00:12:27,827 --> 00:12:29,818
I'll decide about it
once I get the exam results.

113
00:12:30,229 --> 00:12:32,493
But I'm sure of making you my wife.

114
00:12:32,832 --> 00:12:34,823
You'd better make her your wife first.

115
00:12:37,336 --> 00:12:41,670
Ifher business begins to flourish,
you wouldn't have to work for a living.

116
00:12:47,513 --> 00:12:50,175
I know how to silence people like you.

117
00:12:51,851 --> 00:12:54,843
But it's against my principle
to bash up idiots like you.

118
00:12:55,688 --> 00:12:57,679
I'm excusing you once again.

119
00:12:58,124 --> 00:13:01,525
Don't speak to these dogs. Or they'll
bark back at you. Let them bark!

120
00:13:02,361 --> 00:13:05,694
Hey! Besides barking, we bite too!

121
00:13:32,391 --> 00:13:33,483
Hit him hard!

122
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:45,733
O Lord!

123
00:13:46,405 --> 00:13:48,566
The crooks uttered the wrong
things at the wrong place.

124
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,183
You scoundrel!

125
00:14:21,941 --> 00:14:23,932
Get out! You've been bailed.

126
00:14:32,618 --> 00:14:33,778
You vindicated and released those
who were wounded...

127
00:14:35,021 --> 00:14:37,012
...but arrested the one
who fought for justice.

128
00:14:37,223 --> 00:14:38,451
The law is ridiculous, really!

129
00:14:39,025 --> 00:14:40,014
These people were the ones
who instigated trouble.

130
00:14:41,627 --> 00:14:42,685
By holding him guilty for such a
serious offence...

131
00:14:43,629 --> 00:14:45,722
...my son would be labelled as a
criminal. His life would be ruined.

132
00:14:46,832 --> 00:14:50,131
- Do you want him to be released?
- So that he'd commit murders later.

133
00:14:51,237 --> 00:14:54,229
We'll fight for our sons, and ensure
that he is punished.

134
00:14:57,343 --> 00:15:00,039
How long would I be
punished for it?

135
00:15:00,346 --> 00:15:06,842
Anywhere between five to seven years.
It's a case under section 307.

136
00:15:07,853 --> 00:15:11,653
They're rich people. Moreover,
money influences court decisions.

137
00:15:12,658 --> 00:15:16,856
- Hey you! How much is 307 minus 5?
- 302.

138
00:15:17,063 --> 00:15:19,054
But why're you asking me about it?

139
00:15:19,265 --> 00:15:20,789
I'm calculating. The five of you'll be
beaten for five times...

140
00:15:23,269 --> 00:15:25,066
...and the five of you
will die thereafter.

141
00:15:25,271 --> 00:15:30,072
I can be punished only once
for my crime.

142
00:15:30,676 --> 00:15:36,672
Rven a tree dries up if it's
accused of committing murders.

143
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:41,076
Tell me the truth! Didn't your
deeds deserve to be condemned?

144
00:15:42,888 --> 00:15:45,379
Murder?

145
00:15:47,693 --> 00:15:51,686
Father! Murder in a police station?

146
00:15:55,101 --> 00:15:58,093
He'll be punished.
I'm helpless.

147
00:16:01,907 --> 00:16:05,308
- If you could pardon my son...
- You don't have to speak like this.

148
00:16:05,411 --> 00:16:08,710
Let me explain the case to you.

149
00:16:17,423 --> 00:16:21,120
We were at fault. It was us
who tried to molest her.

150
00:16:21,327 --> 00:16:23,921
We don't want to fight the case.
We withdraw our complaint.

151
00:16:29,935 --> 00:16:31,732
Let's go, and save our lives.

152
00:16:48,254 --> 00:16:53,453
You're a son of a retired
policeman. That's why I ask you...

153
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,454
Why do you take
law into your own hands?

154
00:16:55,761 --> 00:16:58,355
What's your name?

155
00:17:01,467 --> 00:17:01,762
Your name is Neelkanth. But you
haven't eaten the poison...

156
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:06,161
...that's running in my veins.

157
00:17:06,772 --> 00:17:08,467
What kind of a poison?

158
00:17:08,774 --> 00:17:10,469
How many members does
your family comprise of/.

159
00:17:10,776 --> 00:17:13,973
- My parents and myseif.
- Then you won't understand.

160
00:17:14,447 --> 00:17:18,178
It would suffice to inform you
that I'm not the policeman's son.

161
00:17:32,198 --> 00:17:35,998
Can we prevent these people from
cursing us if we bash them up?

162
00:17:36,202 --> 00:17:40,195
I'm mistaken. The next time I'll
kill them instead ofbeating them.

163
00:17:41,207 --> 00:17:42,799
So that you may spend the rest of
your life behind bars...

164
00:17:43,008 --> 00:17:45,499
...and I would continue to
visit you all my life.

165
00:17:45,811 --> 00:17:49,008
Neither did I call you here.
Nor will I call you in the jail.

166
00:17:49,315 --> 00:17:51,146
They are educated and cultured people.
Go and mingle with them.

167
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:53,641
You need not meddle
in my affairs.

168
00:22:51,617 --> 00:22:54,780
I'll ask you where're your medals.
You'll say that they are lost.

169
00:22:55,621 --> 00:22:58,613
But the truth is that you've sold
them to bail me out.

170
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:01,782
They've already withdrawn the case.

171
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,951
But you won't be able to
recover your medals now.

172
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:07,463
You've ruined everything.
What do you want to prove?

173
00:23:07,533 --> 00:23:10,297
I don't want to prove anything.
I did what I deemed fit.

174
00:23:10,803 --> 00:23:12,794
- You too didn't prevent him.
- Why should I've stopped him?

175
00:23:12,971 --> 00:23:14,962
If needed, I would've given
my ornaments too.

176
00:23:15,307 --> 00:23:17,969
Is material wealth greater
than your own son?

177
00:23:19,144 --> 00:23:21,476
Don't you call me a son.

178
00:23:22,147 --> 00:23:24,479
Rverybody knows that
neither do I've any relations...

179
00:23:24,983 --> 00:23:25,972
...nor do I consider
anybody my relative.

180
00:23:26,151 --> 00:23:32,818
Does our relationship
hold no value?

181
00:23:33,325 --> 00:23:36,158
It could be. Perhaps that's why you
sacrificed your medals for me.

182
00:23:36,995 --> 00:23:38,986
You should've let me
rot behind bars.

183
00:23:39,064 --> 00:23:40,326
By going to jail,
one doesn't lose one's life.

184
00:23:40,432 --> 00:23:43,663
One who is born will die some day.

185
00:23:46,004 --> 00:23:47,995
Somebody is calling you.

186
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:50,672
- I've heard. I'm not a deaf.
- Why don't you see who it is?

187
00:23:53,512 --> 00:23:57,846
The shirt is so dirty.
Don't you ever take a bath?

188
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:02,853
One doesn't bath too often.

189
00:24:07,693 --> 00:24:11,857
- Ikka has summoned you.
- What can I do?

190
00:24:12,097 --> 00:24:15,863
- He's called you.
- There's unrest in my house.

191
00:24:16,535 --> 00:24:19,026
Let me settle my matter.
I'll come if I find time.

192
00:24:23,375 --> 00:24:24,637
- Listen to me...
- I mean to say...

193
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:27,702
Your son has burdened me with
a favour. I never asked for it.

194
00:24:27,813 --> 00:24:29,542
Why're you hassling mother?

195
00:24:29,615 --> 00:24:32,812
I treated it as my duty.
You treat it as a favour.

196
00:24:33,051 --> 00:24:35,042
I've just done my duty.
Stop quarelling now.

197
00:24:36,388 --> 00:24:39,221
Who were those people?
- They were Ikka's men.

198
00:24:46,899 --> 00:24:51,393
I'm the cause of so many births
and deaths in this locality.

199
00:24:52,237 --> 00:24:58,233
Minister, I distribute bribes on the
first day of every month.

200
00:24:59,411 --> 00:25:01,902
Why do you address me
as a minister?

201
00:25:02,748 --> 00:25:06,912
I've been dismissed from the ruling
party as well as the opposition.

202
00:25:07,753 --> 00:25:10,916
Now even your own folk
don't consider me as an alien.

203
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:21,763
You're not treated as an alien by the
ruling party or the opposition.

204
00:25:22,434 --> 00:25:26,427
That's why you're acting as a conduit
between me and them.

205
00:25:27,439 --> 00:25:31,773
One money-bag is for the ruling party,
and the other is for the opposition.

206
00:25:33,278 --> 00:25:40,116
Nobody will voice any protests,
and nothing will become a hurdle for us.

207
00:25:41,286 --> 00:25:45,950
Rverybody in the government
is bound to demand money.

208
00:25:48,126 --> 00:25:53,120
This money-bag is meant for you, so
that law doesn't arrest us...

209
00:25:53,799 --> 00:25:55,790
...and protect us instead.

210
00:25:56,468 --> 00:25:59,301
The police protects those
who pay for it.

211
00:26:00,305 --> 00:26:01,294
Sir!

212
00:26:03,475 --> 00:26:05,466
Let's go.

213
00:26:12,484 --> 00:26:14,645
Greetings, everybody.

214
00:26:18,323 --> 00:26:22,657
What're you staring at?
Touch his feet.

215
00:26:25,831 --> 00:26:26,991
Be young, always.

216
00:26:29,668 --> 00:26:32,831
May you have many husbands.
May you thrive always.

217
00:26:33,505 --> 00:26:36,338
What did you say?
- Take the bride upstairs.

218
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:41,843
What about you?
- You shouldn't disobey your husband.

219
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:44,671
Come on! Go upstairs.

220
00:26:46,852 --> 00:26:49,343
Move aside.

221
00:26:49,855 --> 00:26:53,347
I've delivered you your decoration.

222
00:26:54,192 --> 00:26:58,288
But what about the ornaments
that she is wearing.

223
00:26:58,697 --> 00:27:00,528
They'll be delivered to
your house tomorrow.

224
00:27:00,766 --> 00:27:04,532
I'll be leaving now , I'll be
marrying again day after tomorrow.

225
00:27:05,971 --> 00:27:08,531
- You may go.
- All right.

226
00:27:09,708 --> 00:27:10,868
Let's go.

227
00:27:13,879 --> 00:27:18,373
Take this. 500 for you.
Come to pose as the witness.

228
00:27:18,884 --> 00:27:22,376
Peanuts are not enough.
I want the entire lot.

229
00:27:22,454 --> 00:27:24,888
Is it? One needs to use
the grey cells for that.

230
00:27:41,573 --> 00:27:42,904
Ajay is on his way.

231
00:27:45,911 --> 00:27:49,745
Distribute the cards.

232
00:28:08,433 --> 00:28:10,424
You're very desirous of meeting me?

233
00:28:10,602 --> 00:28:13,264
Welcome! Would you like
to play cards?

234
00:28:13,605 --> 00:28:17,939
I don't gamble. You need not ask me
for refreshments.

235
00:28:19,277 --> 00:28:20,369
Come straight to the point.

236
00:28:20,946 --> 00:28:25,940
I hear that you bash up
people with ease.

237
00:28:27,285 --> 00:28:27,944
So what?

238
00:28:30,288 --> 00:28:35,624
My doors are always open for
brave and courageous people.

239
00:28:36,294 --> 00:28:40,287
I pay whatever the price.
- I'm not fond of slavery.

240
00:28:41,466 --> 00:28:43,957
Are you short of people?

241
00:28:44,636 --> 00:28:46,627
I'm not short of anything.

242
00:28:46,972 --> 00:28:48,963
You might be the king of your kingdom.

243
00:28:49,474 --> 00:28:51,465
I'm content as I sm.
So what if I'm a poor man.

244
00:28:51,643 --> 00:28:55,977
If the king doesn't need anything,
even a poor man doesn't beg around.

245
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:58,473
Do you know the outcome of
not fulfilling my desire?

246
00:28:58,650 --> 00:28:59,480
Death!

247
00:28:59,818 --> 00:29:02,150
A butcher's desire alone
doesn't kill a cow.

248
00:29:03,655 --> 00:29:08,490
I know that death is lurking
all around me.

249
00:29:09,661 --> 00:29:11,652
I'm leaving.
- I hear that you...

250
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:13,823
are well-versed
with playing cards!

251
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,491
Chausa is your henchman.

252
00:29:17,569 --> 00:29:19,560
That's why he has given
you three kings.

253
00:29:19,638 --> 00:29:24,837
The minister has been given
an ace, a two, and a three.

254
00:29:25,343 --> 00:29:27,174
The policeman has been given
three jacks.

255
00:29:27,245 --> 00:29:29,236
And the fourth one has been
given three sixes.

256
00:29:29,347 --> 00:29:34,683
Chausa himseifhas taken a five,
a two, and an eight.

257
00:29:36,354 --> 00:29:38,117
Let's see whether he made the right
guesses about the cards!

258
00:29:38,356 --> 00:29:40,688
Wow! He's a useful card player.

259
00:29:41,193 --> 00:29:43,184
Shall I kill him?

260
00:29:43,361 --> 00:29:47,855
I've already killed 99 people. By
killing him, I can complete a 100.

261
00:29:48,133 --> 00:29:53,867
He's dynamite. Don't take him
too lightly.

262
00:29:54,539 --> 00:29:56,530
He doesn't bother about anyone.

263
00:29:57,375 --> 00:30:03,041
When such a person becomes loyal to
you, he can face an entire army.

264
00:30:04,382 --> 00:30:08,546
Constable! I've just refused a
confirmed job with Ikka.

265
00:30:09,721 --> 00:30:12,554
I was sure to get a job
as a bodyguard, at least.

266
00:30:16,294 --> 00:30:20,060
Before any trouble comes our way,
you'd better sign on this paper.

267
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:25,235
- A new job again?
- Shanta has arranged a job for you.

268
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:27,566
If you serve the people,
you would be a happy man.

269
00:30:28,907 --> 00:30:31,569
You've proved that
love can cripple a person.

270
00:30:31,843 --> 00:30:34,073
You took to playing cards when
one is supposed to educate oneseif.

271
00:30:34,412 --> 00:30:39,247
I kept quiet. I know that bashing up
doesn't change a criminal.

272
00:30:40,085 --> 00:30:41,677
So you were just a kid.

273
00:30:41,753 --> 00:30:46,190
But remember that you've sweared upon
me that even if you gamble...

274
00:30:46,258 --> 00:30:48,249
...you'll gamble with me,
not with outsiders.

275
00:30:48,426 --> 00:30:50,758
We're able to afford meals by whatever
you get through your pension.

276
00:30:51,096 --> 00:30:54,429
Whoever wins, gets to eat the meals.
Loser goes to sleep without eating.

277
00:30:55,433 --> 00:30:57,424
You're sure to retire to bed
without eating today.

278
00:31:06,611 --> 00:31:09,102
Here's my stake.

279
00:31:16,621 --> 00:31:18,282
And here's my stake.

280
00:31:19,791 --> 00:31:21,952
This is my move.

281
00:31:23,628 --> 00:31:25,619
I prefer a show.

282
00:31:29,467 --> 00:31:34,962
Show me superior cards. Or you'll
have to sleep hungry tonight.

283
00:31:36,908 --> 00:31:38,466
I concede defeat today.

284
00:31:55,160 --> 00:32:00,655
Scoundrel! He lost deliberately
today too.

285
00:32:03,835 --> 00:32:05,826
Serve the food. Ajay has arrived
after losing the game.

286
00:32:07,005 --> 00:32:13,001
You were delayed today. Did you
happen to visit Ikka?

287
00:32:14,179 --> 00:32:16,170
I can visit death if
I were asked to.

288
00:32:18,016 --> 00:32:19,608
People like Ikka
aren't worth a dime.

289
00:32:21,853 --> 00:32:24,014
Never go to Ikka.

290
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:27,181
They're very sharp people.

291
00:32:27,692 --> 00:32:31,685
When they sight a suitable person,
they force the person into their trade.

292
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:35,363
How can he force me?
I'll break his nose.

293
00:32:36,868 --> 00:32:38,699
Moreover, I'm going to
get employed now.

294
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:40,761
- O Lord!
- You keep quiet.

295
00:32:40,872 --> 00:32:44,205
I'll pray to the Lord
so that you stick to your job.

296
00:32:45,543 --> 00:32:47,534
You'd better speak to a poor God.

297
00:32:49,881 --> 00:32:51,872
The rich Gods have been cornered
by influential and rich people.

298
00:32:55,553 --> 00:32:58,386
I've prayed to the Lord. A flower
has dropped into the plate too.

299
00:32:58,723 --> 00:33:01,055
I'm sure that you'll receive such
a job that will bring joy.

300
00:33:01,226 --> 00:33:03,717
So the dispute now is between
the job and the God!

301
00:33:04,729 --> 00:33:06,720
Both of may quarrel.
I'm leaving to attend the duty.

302
00:33:09,067 --> 00:33:11,058
It's your first day at job.

303
00:33:11,236 --> 00:33:16,401
You'll have to stay amidst
dead bodies for 8 hours daily.

304
00:33:17,575 --> 00:33:19,566
I hope you wouldn't be scared.

305
00:33:20,078 --> 00:33:22,069
It's the relatives who're
scared of dead bodies.

306
00:33:22,147 --> 00:33:24,411
They consign the dead bodies to flames
within minutes.

307
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:27,741
As far as I'm concerned,
I'm not related to the dead bodies.

308
00:33:28,253 --> 00:33:30,244
That's brave of you.

309
00:33:31,589 --> 00:33:34,752
Sir, please give me the document.
I'll let this dead body be taken away.

310
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:40,921
Rxcuse me! You're new at the job.

311
00:33:42,934 --> 00:33:44,925
The post-mortem of these dead bodies
has been completed.

312
00:33:45,937 --> 00:33:48,770
Let these bodies be taken away only
after they pay us the taxes.

313
00:33:49,774 --> 00:33:52,766
I'm referring to the bribes.
Do you understand?

314
00:33:53,778 --> 00:33:58,442
Go with him and check if the relatives
of these dead bodies have arrived.

315
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:06,454
Please help me.
Help me get the body of my son.

316
00:34:10,295 --> 00:34:14,959
My son was run down by a car.
He died within three minutes.

317
00:34:15,633 --> 00:34:18,295
His dead body is rotting
since the past three days.

318
00:34:19,637 --> 00:34:21,628
How can I arrange so much money
to pay them?

319
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:25,973
Please help me
secure his dead body.

320
00:34:26,644 --> 00:34:29,135
I beg of you!

321
00:34:41,326 --> 00:34:43,419
Give all the dead bodies
to their relatives.

322
00:34:43,661 --> 00:34:44,992
- Did you get the money?
- Yes.

323
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:48,322
He seems to be experienced.
We'll appoint him permanently.

324
00:34:49,667 --> 00:34:51,658
You may take away
all the dead bodies.

325
00:34:58,676 --> 00:35:00,667
What're you doing?.

326
00:35:01,179 --> 00:35:02,578
Why did you close the door?

327
00:35:06,017 --> 00:35:08,508
How much for one dead body?
- 500 rupees.

328
00:35:12,857 --> 00:35:15,348
- How much did you say?
- 500 rupees.

329
00:35:17,695 --> 00:35:19,686
You'll be thrashed
a thousand times.

330
00:35:20,932 --> 00:35:22,923
Help!

331
00:35:40,718 --> 00:35:43,209
- Where are you going?.
- I'll never do a job in future.

332
00:35:44,055 --> 00:35:45,989
The entire world has become
a brothel.

333
00:35:46,057 --> 00:35:48,617
At some places, living bodies are sold.
Rven dead bodies are sold for a price.

334
00:35:49,227 --> 00:35:51,218
Bribery was considered an ill
many years ago.

335
00:35:52,897 --> 00:35:55,388
Now if you don't indulge in bribery,
it's considered undesirable.

336
00:35:56,734 --> 00:35:58,725
Rvery profession has become sleazy.

337
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:01,229
The burden of education...The burden
of text books.

338
00:36:02,073 --> 00:36:05,236
At least you managed and assignment
of lifting weights.

339
00:36:17,755 --> 00:36:19,916
I'm tired. Please calculate the smount.

340
00:36:21,426 --> 00:36:24,259
- How many pages do your books contain?
- I never counted.

341
00:36:24,929 --> 00:36:26,920
But why do you ask?

342
00:36:27,432 --> 00:36:29,593
You don't even know the number of
pages contained in your book.

343
00:36:30,101 --> 00:36:34,265
Look at me. I've studied only one
book. It contains only 52 pages.

344
00:36:43,615 --> 00:36:48,609
- Can't you hear these shrieks?
- I don't care a damn.

345
00:36:50,121 --> 00:36:53,454
- But I can hear them?
- That's because you're educated.

346
00:36:53,958 --> 00:36:55,949
Rducation has no connection
with such matters.

347
00:36:56,127 --> 00:36:57,958
You've received the affection
of your mother.

348
00:36:58,029 --> 00:36:59,963
So you should not be too worried.

349
00:37:00,031 --> 00:37:02,022
I feel like shooting down
these scoundrels.

350
00:37:02,967 --> 00:37:04,958
Go ahead. Who's preventing you?

351
00:37:07,805 --> 00:37:09,966
I remember my mother and
stop myseif from doing it.

352
00:37:10,975 --> 00:37:12,806
Her efforts in raising me
will go down the drain.

353
00:37:12,977 --> 00:37:15,969
So you should maintain at least
one relationship properly.

354
00:37:16,981 --> 00:37:19,814
If God starts accounting for the
relationships that are up for sale...

355
00:37:20,718 --> 00:37:22,652
...it would mark the end
of relationships.

356
00:37:23,154 --> 00:37:25,145
Greetings, sir.

357
00:37:26,157 --> 00:37:30,150
I've brought this beauty.
Look at her once.

358
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:34,821
She's my own niece.

359
00:37:35,166 --> 00:37:37,999
just when she grew up into a young
girl, my sister passed away.

360
00:37:39,003 --> 00:37:42,666
I gave her shelter.
But she'll serve you.

361
00:38:00,024 --> 00:38:02,015
Take her away.

362
00:38:02,093 --> 00:38:04,084
She'll bear all your
atrocities patiently.

363
00:38:05,029 --> 00:38:07,020
She's deaf.

364
00:38:09,867 --> 00:38:12,028
- Leave me.
- Come on, girl.

365
00:38:13,137 --> 00:38:15,128
We'll keep you in
a golden prison.

366
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:24,204
- My gift, sir.
- You're amazing, really.

367
00:38:25,216 --> 00:38:26,877
Pick up the smount
and get lost!

368
00:38:27,552 --> 00:38:31,215
Sir, an unrelated girl is worth 5000.

369
00:38:32,557 --> 00:38:35,720
A blood relative should
fetch at least 50,000.

370
00:38:36,461 --> 00:38:38,725
I shower unlimited money
on the brave ones.

371
00:38:39,897 --> 00:38:43,663
But cowards who demand money
are killed by me.

372
00:38:52,243 --> 00:38:57,738
Dump him somewhere. But be careful,
he's a corpse, after all.

373
00:39:01,586 --> 00:39:03,747
Run! It's the police!

374
00:39:07,258 --> 00:39:09,249
Hey!

375
00:39:11,095 --> 00:39:12,084
Don't move.

376
00:39:16,601 --> 00:39:18,592
I was searching for you
since many days.

377
00:39:19,437 --> 00:39:21,428
I'll ensure that you're
awarded the death penalty.

378
00:39:26,444 --> 00:39:28,435
The inspector has arrested them.

379
00:39:31,949 --> 00:39:33,280
Inform Gulati about it.

380
00:39:33,618 --> 00:39:35,779
My century is still pending.

381
00:39:45,863 --> 00:39:48,627
You've arrested Abu and his men.

382
00:39:49,467 --> 00:39:55,303
I've kidnapped your parents.
They're in my custody.

383
00:39:59,143 --> 00:40:01,805
The number of times
you torture my men...

384
00:40:03,147 --> 00:40:06,139
...I'll torture your parents
as many times.

385
00:40:06,417 --> 00:40:09,818
You'll not harm my parents.

386
00:40:10,321 --> 00:40:13,813
No, I'll not hurt them.

387
00:40:15,326 --> 00:40:20,161
We'll be exchanging your parents
with my men.

388
00:40:21,165 --> 00:40:27,161
We'll do it tomorrow. I'll decide
the time and place.

389
00:40:32,844 --> 00:40:36,336
Nobody will accompany me.
Neither will anyone follow me.

390
00:40:37,515 --> 00:40:40,006
I don't need an army
to deal with these crooks.

391
00:40:40,284 --> 00:40:47,122
You're right. One needs guts, and
not an army, to deal with crooks.

392
00:40:47,358 --> 00:40:50,850
I don't need to borrow guts from
people like you to fight my battles.

393
00:40:51,696 --> 00:40:54,529
People like you cannot estimate
the power of this uniform.

394
00:40:55,032 --> 00:40:57,523
Rvery person can estimate the
power of this uniform.

395
00:40:58,369 --> 00:41:00,360
Rvery decent human being
fears this uniform.

396
00:41:01,038 --> 00:41:03,529
Rven if you visit anybody's place
as his guest dressed in uniform...

397
00:41:04,375 --> 00:41:06,866
..the entire neighbourhood looks upon
the person as a criminal.

398
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:17,604
You release our men from your end.
We'll send your parents from our end.

399
00:43:04,996 --> 00:43:05,655
Son!

400
00:43:43,534 --> 00:43:45,525
No! Don't shoot him!

401
00:43:45,870 --> 00:43:48,361
The entire police department
will thirst for our blood!

402
00:43:49,874 --> 00:43:51,865
Crush him to death.

403
00:43:52,376 --> 00:43:54,310
Crush him.

404
00:44:02,219 --> 00:44:06,212
I won't spare you.

405
00:44:10,728 --> 00:44:12,889
If you harm my parents..

406
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:16,393
I like blood!

407
00:44:16,567 --> 00:44:19,900
Once they're dead,
my century would be complete.

408
00:44:26,077 --> 00:44:27,066
No.

409
00:44:31,415 --> 00:44:33,076
Mother!

410
00:44:38,022 --> 00:44:39,011
Son!

411
00:44:40,191 --> 00:44:41,180
No!

412
00:46:30,034 --> 00:46:36,872
Abu is dead!
My century is complete!

413
00:47:02,967 --> 00:47:06,562
You've done us a great favour
by saving our lives.

414
00:47:06,637 --> 00:47:07,968
We're indebted to you.

415
00:47:08,072 --> 00:47:10,233
The practice of remembering
favours doesn't exist these days.

416
00:47:10,908 --> 00:47:14,241
Live with the times.
Don't believe in fables.

417
00:47:15,079 --> 00:47:17,570
Seems like you've experienced
life from close quarters.

418
00:47:18,315 --> 00:47:21,250
Your parents are blessed indeed.

419
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:25,411
Don't bless my parents.

420
00:47:25,756 --> 00:47:29,317
Or else every mother will feed the
child filth instead of milk.

421
00:47:31,762 --> 00:47:34,754
I didn't know about you.

422
00:47:37,434 --> 00:47:40,597
But I feel that I've begun
to understand you.

423
00:47:41,772 --> 00:47:43,763
My life has no significance.

424
00:47:44,608 --> 00:47:46,599
Neither do I want to
make a name for myseif.

425
00:47:47,611 --> 00:47:49,442
I'll remain as I sm.

426
00:47:50,781 --> 00:47:52,772
I should be leaving now.

427
00:47:55,619 --> 00:47:58,281
What's our relation with him?
Nothing.

428
00:48:00,124 --> 00:48:02,115
What's his selfish motive
behind saving our lives?

429
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:04,450
Nothing.

430
00:48:05,629 --> 00:48:07,620
He belongs to some other age.

431
00:48:08,632 --> 00:48:10,463
He has stumbled into
the present age.

432
00:48:10,697 --> 00:48:14,690
The inspector has mentioned only
about himseif in his report.

433
00:48:15,702 --> 00:48:19,035
But a crook had mentioned about
one more man before he died.

434
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:25,701
He was none other than Ajay.

435
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:29,040
By killing them, Ajay hasn't
made enemies with us.

436
00:48:30,049 --> 00:48:32,040
In fact, he has come closer to us.

437
00:48:34,721 --> 00:48:38,714
The vacancies created now can be
filled up by Ajay's entry.

438
00:48:40,727 --> 00:48:44,060
I'll keep him in my cage.

439
00:49:03,583 --> 00:49:07,246
This dead body has been placed here
so that all of you realise that..

440
00:49:08,087 --> 00:49:10,248
...there are several ways
to come to this place.

441
00:49:10,757 --> 00:49:13,920
But one who tries to escape
has to go up in the heavens.

442
00:49:19,098 --> 00:49:21,089
Move away!

443
00:49:25,271 --> 00:49:27,262
You've died?

444
00:49:36,115 --> 00:49:38,777
They killed my husband.
He was a sinner.

445
00:49:39,285 --> 00:49:41,276
I did not cry.
I did not scresm.

446
00:49:45,291 --> 00:49:47,282
But what was the
guilt of my niece?

447
00:49:50,296 --> 00:49:52,628
Why did they kill you?

448
00:50:00,306 --> 00:50:02,297
I don't recognise her.

449
00:50:06,646 --> 00:50:08,637
She has been shocked.

450
00:50:09,148 --> 00:50:11,139
Looks like she has turned insane.

451
00:50:12,318 --> 00:50:13,307
No.

452
00:50:17,990 --> 00:50:19,150
Who're you?

453
00:55:22,628 --> 00:55:25,461
You're here?
Who was he?

454
00:55:30,970 --> 00:55:32,961
Are you lost in thoughts?

455
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:37,803
Rven in your absence,
I was in your company.

456
00:55:38,978 --> 00:55:40,309
This is what love is about.

457
00:55:56,328 --> 00:55:59,820
Neither do I oppose love,
nor those who fall in love.

458
00:56:01,167 --> 00:56:05,331
But I don't like if a relationship
becomes the talk of the town.

459
00:56:06,005 --> 00:56:08,838
Who is he? which family
does he belong to?

460
00:56:10,009 --> 00:56:12,671
Ask his family members to
come and meet me.

461
00:56:13,512 --> 00:56:15,844
You'll marry? You'll
make your own family?

462
00:56:16,348 --> 00:56:19,840
But how can you? In this place, even
a housewife is considered a whore.

463
00:56:20,186 --> 00:56:22,177
How does it matter how
others look at it?

464
00:56:22,521 --> 00:56:26,355
You've maintained this place as a home.
The society cannot label it a brothel.

465
00:56:26,592 --> 00:56:28,583
Neither can one call it a home
just because you say so.

466
00:56:29,528 --> 00:56:32,190
Rven if I sell all I have and
enter the society afresh...

467
00:56:32,531 --> 00:56:34,692
...your mother's past
will be questioned.

468
00:56:36,368 --> 00:56:42,364
I want to go back to the society
from where I came into this filth.

469
00:56:43,209 --> 00:56:48,203
That will be possible only when you
scale the heights where you...

470
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:53,217
...get your mother, and neither does
society enquire about her past.

471
00:56:55,221 --> 00:56:58,713
Mother, I'll take you
of this filth.

472
00:56:59,725 --> 00:57:01,556
But how is it related to my marriage?

473
00:57:01,827 --> 00:57:03,886
Truly speaking, it has to do
with your marriage.

474
00:57:05,231 --> 00:57:11,568
How'll your wife respect you if a
stranger'll make passes at her?

475
00:57:12,238 --> 00:57:15,401
- How many people will you confront?
- Whom are you referring to?

476
00:57:16,242 --> 00:57:19,405
You need not interfere today.
It's our family affair.

477
00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:22,070
One family affair has made me
an alien?

478
00:57:22,414 --> 00:57:25,406
Our homes might be different.
But we've a common father.

479
00:57:25,584 --> 00:57:29,577
Why don't you explain to him?
He wants to get married!

480
00:57:30,089 --> 00:57:33,422
The entire world is entering into
matrimony. What ifhe marries too?

481
00:57:33,592 --> 00:57:36,925
I knew that both of you
have similar views.

482
00:57:37,596 --> 00:57:39,587
I expected you to
take his side.

483
00:57:40,099 --> 00:57:41,532
All right, I'll take your side.

484
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:43,932
May God never let your son
get married in his lifetime.

485
00:57:44,103 --> 00:57:46,094
Are you siding me,
or are you cursing me?

486
00:57:46,438 --> 00:57:48,770
which mother wouldn't like
his son to settle down?

487
00:57:49,275 --> 00:57:51,106
You want to have your way
in every respect.

488
00:57:51,177 --> 00:57:54,943
Sometimes you speak against marriage.
Sometimes you're in favour of it.

489
00:57:55,614 --> 00:57:58,777
I've understood. You want to win
the game at all costs.

490
00:57:59,618 --> 00:58:02,951
You'll enter the normal society
at some point of time.

491
00:58:03,789 --> 00:58:08,453
But ifhis beloved slips out ofhis
hands, he'll turn insane.

492
00:58:08,794 --> 00:58:11,456
You'd better finalise
his alliance.

493
00:58:11,897 --> 00:58:15,128
I'll never invite the girl's family
members to finalise the alliance.

494
00:58:15,301 --> 00:58:17,292
We'll go in their locality.

495
00:58:21,807 --> 00:58:23,297
O Lord!

496
00:58:24,476 --> 00:58:28,310
We're constables by caste. We can be
found in the police or the military.

497
00:58:29,148 --> 00:58:31,810
But nowadays you can find constables
like us too, who don't wear uniforms.

498
00:58:32,484 --> 00:58:39,253
A child can never forget the locality
where he is brought up as a kid.

499
00:58:39,491 --> 00:58:41,391
which is that locality
that you're talking about?

500
00:58:42,328 --> 00:58:44,990
Don't get excited. You're too old
to visit that locality.

501
00:58:49,501 --> 00:58:51,492
Shloka and me have
one basic difference.

502
00:58:51,837 --> 00:58:55,671
He knows only his mother's name.
I don't know both my parents names.

503
00:58:56,842 --> 00:58:58,833
Your daughter and Shloka
love each other.

504
00:58:59,345 --> 00:59:01,336
I've come to ask for your daughter's
hand in marriage to Shloka.

505
00:59:02,681 --> 00:59:05,673
Does my daughter know
about your family history?

506
00:59:06,852 --> 00:59:08,843
A lie can never conceal facts.

507
00:59:09,855 --> 00:59:11,789
I've not hidden a single
fact from your daughter.

508
00:59:11,957 --> 00:59:14,016
My daughter has selected
a wonderful boy for herseif.

509
00:59:15,194 --> 00:59:18,357
If you possess any other quality,
do let me know about it.

510
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:23,191
Now his qualities are being published
in the newspapers too.

511
00:59:24,203 --> 00:59:26,194
Look at this picture ofShloka.

512
00:59:28,774 --> 00:59:31,368
Neither is he smong the missing.
Nor is wanted by the police.

513
00:59:31,877 --> 00:59:33,367
He has topped in the university.

514
00:59:34,213 --> 00:59:37,376
We don't want any wealth or dowry.

515
00:59:38,384 --> 00:59:40,375
Your daughter will live with
respect and dignity.

516
00:59:40,886 --> 00:59:42,478
I've come to hear
a positive response.

517
00:59:42,554 --> 00:59:44,545
If you refuse, the marriage will
take place in a temple.

518
00:59:44,723 --> 00:59:45,815
If you accept, it will be
held in your house.

519
00:59:45,991 --> 00:59:47,982
I admire your guts.

520
00:59:48,894 --> 00:59:51,055
You may take birth in our locality
in your next life.

521
00:59:51,897 --> 00:59:54,058
You'll become gusty by facing
the abuses, hunger and poverty.

522
00:59:55,567 --> 01:00:00,061
I've seen it all
in my present birth.

523
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:06,906
I don't know who left me
at the entrance of an orphanage.

524
01:00:08,247 --> 01:00:10,408
But due to my hard work
and dedication...

525
01:00:11,250 --> 01:00:17,086
...I've made such a name for myseif,
that nobody asks me about my family.

526
01:00:18,424 --> 01:00:22,588
It'll not be easy for Shloka
to reach that level.

527
01:00:23,429 --> 01:00:25,420
The most difficult thing on earth
is to take birth.

528
01:00:26,598 --> 01:00:29,829
You tell us your requirement.
It'll be fulfilled.

529
01:00:32,438 --> 01:00:35,430
This is an approved plan
for a new project.

530
01:00:36,041 --> 01:00:40,102
If I give it to Shloka, he can become
a millionaire overnight.

531
01:00:40,946 --> 01:00:44,848
So he'll have to become a millionaire
to marry your daughter.

532
01:00:45,117 --> 01:00:47,950
Yes. Because those were take up jobs,
their lifetime is spent in...

533
01:00:48,053 --> 01:00:51,113
...making a name for himseif
and preserving their names.

534
01:00:51,457 --> 01:00:55,621
But a boss is a boss, who is respected
both by the employee and the society.

535
01:00:56,295 --> 01:00:59,128
I can believe you. Rxplain to us
your the value of the plan too.

536
01:00:59,298 --> 01:01:01,789
The project will cost five crores.

537
01:01:02,968 --> 01:01:05,801
I'll arrange an eighty per cent
loan from the bank.

538
01:01:06,805 --> 01:01:09,296
You'll have to arrange for
only one crore rupees.

539
01:01:09,975 --> 01:01:13,138
Such a condition cannot be
fulfilled in ten lifetimes too.

540
01:01:13,479 --> 01:01:15,470
But you've to be united
in one lifetime.

541
01:01:15,547 --> 01:01:17,811
- Let's go home.
- He's scared.

542
01:01:18,484 --> 01:01:19,974
How soon do we have to
arrange the money?

543
01:01:20,052 --> 01:01:22,043
As soon you arrange the money,
the marriage can take place.

544
01:01:30,829 --> 01:01:32,820
Couldn't you have helped them?

545
01:01:32,998 --> 01:01:36,161
If I wanted, I could've
given them one crore rupees.

546
01:01:37,002 --> 01:01:40,665
But before I could mention it,
the alliance would've severed.

547
01:01:41,507 --> 01:01:45,500
These poor people are those who
value seif-respect.

548
01:01:46,011 --> 01:01:49,003
No smount of money can make them
compromise on this issue.

549
01:01:50,516 --> 01:01:54,008
You'll gamble?
- Who's not gambling?.

550
01:01:56,522 --> 01:02:00,185
The girl's father put down a condition
of one crore rupees. Isn't it gambling?.

551
01:02:01,693 --> 01:02:04,025
I wonder on what basis did the
constable quarel with his wife...

552
01:02:05,531 --> 01:02:08,864
...and acquired me?
Is this not gambling?.

553
01:02:10,035 --> 01:02:12,026
Your mother educated you with
a dresm in her eyes.

554
01:02:14,039 --> 01:02:16,030
Is her dresm not a gamble?

555
01:02:18,377 --> 01:02:20,709
In reality, a human being
gambles all his life.

556
01:02:22,548 --> 01:02:24,880
He just gives it different names
for his personal satisfaction.

557
01:02:26,051 --> 01:02:28,713
What about your promise of
staying away from gambling?.

558
01:02:31,056 --> 01:02:33,047
Do you know why
one makes promises?

559
01:02:34,893 --> 01:02:36,884
So that he can break them.

560
01:02:49,975 --> 01:02:53,069
Connect me to Ikka.
There's good news.

561
01:02:53,412 --> 01:02:56,074
Ajay wants to speak to you
from the casino.

562
01:02:58,083 --> 01:02:59,914
Are there any restrictions
on my coming here?

563
01:03:00,085 --> 01:03:01,518
Not all all.

564
01:03:01,753 --> 01:03:04,415
- Any restrictions on my gambling?.
- None at all.

565
01:03:05,123 --> 01:03:09,253
- Loan me 10 lakh rupees.
- You'll receive the loan.

566
01:03:10,696 --> 01:03:14,928
But what is your guarantee if you're
unable to return the amount?

567
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:16,929
My own.

568
01:03:17,002 --> 01:03:21,439
If I lose 10 lakh rupees, I'll
become your slave for a lifetime.

569
01:03:23,942 --> 01:03:27,275
You'll definitely become my slave.

570
01:03:27,546 --> 01:03:29,275
Give him the money immediately.

571
01:03:29,448 --> 01:03:31,439
One who is willing to offer himseif
in return for money...

572
01:03:32,451 --> 01:03:34,214
...he'll never betray you.

573
01:03:35,287 --> 01:03:37,118
Give the phone to the cashier.

574
01:03:37,956 --> 01:03:40,015
Give counters worth ten lakhs
to Ajay.

575
01:03:41,293 --> 01:03:44,956
I want to see the magic
of your shuffling.

576
01:03:46,131 --> 01:03:48,122
You take an smount of one crore.

577
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:52,637
You make sure that you make him
bet even the clothes he's wearing.

578
01:03:52,804 --> 01:03:54,965
He'll return from this place
in the nude.

579
01:03:58,977 --> 01:04:03,812
The winner will deal the cards.
Two champions are playing today.

580
01:04:05,317 --> 01:04:08,309
Yes, of course. After all, you are
the last trump card of Ikka.

581
01:04:08,654 --> 01:04:10,986
You'll definitely trap me
and take me to Ikka.

582
01:06:10,108 --> 01:06:12,099
I've three kings.

583
01:06:14,613 --> 01:06:16,103
Stop!

584
01:06:16,181 --> 01:06:20,777
I've three aces.
See for yourseif.

585
01:06:48,547 --> 01:06:50,538
Here's one crore rupees.

586
01:06:52,217 --> 01:06:56,153
You're very lucky. I'm returning you
your ten lakh rupees.

587
01:06:57,823 --> 01:06:59,484
I'm only taking away
one crore rupees.

588
01:07:52,711 --> 01:07:55,373
I've lost!

589
01:07:55,881 --> 01:07:58,816
I've no enmity with anybody.
All of you. Go away.

590
01:07:59,151 --> 01:08:02,552
Make an annoucement that
I've closed down the gambling den.

591
01:08:02,888 --> 01:08:07,882
Ajay took away one crores.
Nobody'll harm in any manner.

592
01:08:09,394 --> 01:08:11,385
Hey! Raise your hands...

593
01:08:11,730 --> 01:08:16,565
...and let me digest the fact that
somebody could defeat me so badly.

594
01:08:17,903 --> 01:08:21,066
All of you will mourn the loss.

595
01:08:22,073 --> 01:08:25,975
But it's good that he has
my one crores.

596
01:08:26,912 --> 01:08:32,908
That is the only link which can
bring him to me now.

597
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:37,413
This time he'll have to play the game
directly with me.

598
01:08:38,757 --> 01:08:40,748
I cannot be defeated in gambling
even if the God were to rival me.

599
01:08:58,777 --> 01:09:02,611
You'll make his destiny with money
acquired through gambling?.

600
01:09:02,948 --> 01:09:04,939
Can anyone thrive on money
earned through gambling?.

601
01:09:05,283 --> 01:09:09,117
Take away this money.
I don't want ill-earned money.

602
01:09:09,788 --> 01:09:13,952
How can you change our destiny?

603
01:09:14,793 --> 01:09:16,784
Money is money, after all.
One cannot say for sure whether...

604
01:09:16,862 --> 01:09:17,794
...it's earned through
gambling or hard work.

605
01:09:17,963 --> 01:09:23,629
Well-spoken, my son. Where did you
learn such brave words? From Ajay?

606
01:09:24,135 --> 01:09:28,629
Playing cards've been Ajay's mistress
ever since he was in school.

607
01:09:29,140 --> 01:09:34,134
Ajay has no future. He has been
born out of a gutter.

608
01:09:34,646 --> 01:09:37,581
If Ajay has been born in a gutter,
neither sm I a saint's son?

609
01:09:37,816 --> 01:09:39,977
But I've brought you up
with sincerity.

610
01:09:40,986 --> 01:09:44,319
Rven if I'd earned my wealth by
prostitution, it was hard-earned money.

611
01:09:45,490 --> 01:09:48,323
I staked everything I had
to make your life.

612
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:52,493
And now you ruined everything.

613
01:09:53,164 --> 01:09:56,656
I've not come across as shameless
a person as you are.

614
01:09:57,502 --> 01:09:59,663
You're sitting here in spite
ofbeing bashed up severely?

615
01:10:00,171 --> 01:10:02,162
Get out from here.

616
01:10:02,340 --> 01:10:06,674
I'm sitting here simply to ask you
if you've been hurt.

617
01:10:08,013 --> 01:10:10,345
Why should you be bothered
whether I'm wounded or not?

618
01:10:11,016 --> 01:10:16,010
Get out from here. Never come back.
My doors are closed for you.

619
01:10:17,522 --> 01:10:19,513
I don't know whether my body
has been injured or not.

620
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:23,751
But I'm experiencing pain
somewhere within.

621
01:10:30,035 --> 01:10:32,026
You're crazy.

622
01:10:34,039 --> 01:10:36,030
You hit first, and cry later.

623
01:10:37,042 --> 01:10:42,537
Get away. Don't speak to me.
Neither will I speak to him.

624
01:10:45,216 --> 01:10:48,208
I'd made you promise, didn't you?
You broke the promise?

625
01:10:48,887 --> 01:10:53,381
It was my mistake to hold expectations
from a filthy person like you.

626
01:10:54,059 --> 01:10:57,392
You're a filthy man. And you'll
always remain a filthy man.

627
01:11:03,401 --> 01:11:06,564
Do you know whom you've
made enemies with?

628
01:11:07,572 --> 01:11:12,407
Rven senior officers and landlords
don't raise their voices against him.

629
01:11:14,079 --> 01:11:18,413
Why did you've to go there?

630
01:11:20,585 --> 01:11:23,577
I've no place in my home
where I can keep you.

631
01:11:24,089 --> 01:11:28,753
I lost my wife first.
Now I'm losing you too.

632
01:11:29,427 --> 01:11:31,759
Get lost from here.
Get lost, you scoundrel.

633
01:16:30,895 --> 01:16:33,227
You used to get defeated
every day, didn't you?

634
01:16:36,067 --> 01:16:39,559
When I distributed the cards
today, you won.

635
01:16:42,807 --> 01:16:45,901
How can I eat bread
which I've already lost?

636
01:16:47,578 --> 01:16:51,139
You were defeated so easily.
Give me the cards.

637
01:16:52,250 --> 01:16:53,808
I'll see how you're defeated.

638
01:16:54,419 --> 01:16:58,753
You get defeated deliberately
so that I can eat the bread.

639
01:17:00,425 --> 01:17:03,758
You think, I don't realise it?
- You always got defeated, constable!

640
01:17:05,763 --> 01:17:09,927
Come home. I'm feeling very hungry.

641
01:17:10,601 --> 01:17:12,762
But there's one condition.
I'll deal the cards.

642
01:17:13,604 --> 01:17:15,595
So that I feed myself?.

643
01:17:16,441 --> 01:17:18,375
A worm's stomach can be filled
simply by smelling the gutters.

644
01:17:22,447 --> 01:17:25,109
I'd only beaten you and
pushed you around.

645
01:17:26,951 --> 01:17:30,443
But you're flogging me.

646
01:17:33,624 --> 01:17:35,615
Come home, son.

647
01:17:37,295 --> 01:17:40,458
- How long will you not eat food?
- Till you pardon Ajay and myseif.

648
01:17:41,199 --> 01:17:43,190
Are you testing the
patience of affection?

649
01:17:45,803 --> 01:17:50,638
Money doesn't pour down from the skies.
What is Ajay's fault?

650
01:17:51,142 --> 01:17:55,135
Only that he gambled only once so that
he could fulfill your dresms?

651
01:17:55,747 --> 01:17:57,806
Don't consider this money as
earned through gambling.

652
01:17:57,982 --> 01:17:59,973
All this money is a loan to me.

653
01:18:00,318 --> 01:18:05,483
As soon as I inaugurate my factory,
I'll repay one crore rupees to Ikka.

654
01:18:07,091 --> 01:18:09,082
It's not the whirlpool of Mahabharat..

655
01:18:09,494 --> 01:18:13,157
...which was learnt by Abhimanyu when
he was in his mother's womb.

656
01:18:13,998 --> 01:18:17,832
It's the whirlpool of our own destiny,
which has to be tackled on our own.

657
01:18:19,837 --> 01:18:22,499
I promise you, mother.
We'll tackle it together.

658
01:18:23,241 --> 01:18:25,232
I hope that our destiny doesn't
experience any eclipse.

659
01:18:25,843 --> 01:18:27,834
Return this money as soon as you can..

660
01:18:28,513 --> 01:18:31,175
...so that Ajay's and your life
are not in danger any longer.

661
01:18:33,351 --> 01:18:38,345
- Rat the meals now.
- No, mother. Ajay is yet to come.

662
01:18:38,523 --> 01:18:41,924
- Bring the plate and come out.
- Hey! Why don't you come in?

663
01:18:42,360 --> 01:18:44,851
Your mother hit me and threw me
out of the house.

664
01:18:48,032 --> 01:18:51,195
You'd better go outside.
He's an insistent person.

665
01:18:52,036 --> 01:18:55,267
Rven if I ask him for forgiveness,
he'll give me a long lecture.

666
01:18:55,540 --> 01:18:59,533
Send Shloka outside. Both of us
are feeling very hungry.

667
01:19:30,741 --> 01:19:33,232
When'll you stop speaking
harsh words?

668
01:19:34,579 --> 01:19:36,570
When'll you stop running away
from truth?

669
01:19:37,582 --> 01:19:39,573
Truth is always harsh.

670
01:19:40,751 --> 01:19:43,743
Won't you enter the house?

671
01:19:44,755 --> 01:19:48,589
You've thrown me out. If you call me,
I'll come inside.

672
01:19:53,431 --> 01:19:55,422
Shall I tell you something?.

673
01:19:56,100 --> 01:20:00,264
Find a nice girl, and settle down.

674
01:20:02,106 --> 01:20:04,097
What difference will that make?

675
01:20:04,175 --> 01:20:06,769
Your generation will multiply.
You'll have a family of your own.

676
01:20:08,613 --> 01:20:12,606
It would be better if my generation
doesn't progress any further.

677
01:20:14,619 --> 01:20:16,610
A family should have some foundation.

678
01:20:18,456 --> 01:20:20,447
What kind of a belief do you have?

679
01:20:25,963 --> 01:20:27,954
That of a gutter.

680
01:20:30,968 --> 01:20:36,634
One crore rupees! How did you manage
to arrange so much money so soon?

681
01:20:37,975 --> 01:20:44,471
I haven't done anything which would
burden my conscience.

682
01:20:45,650 --> 01:20:47,641
I don't want to dwelve any deeper.

683
01:20:48,486 --> 01:20:50,477
I'll need some time to legitimise
this money.

684
01:20:51,489 --> 01:20:52,649
All right.

685
01:20:52,723 --> 01:20:55,658
You learned the theory ofbusiness
while in college.

686
01:20:56,661 --> 01:21:01,325
You may attend office from tomorrow
and learn about business practically.

687
01:21:01,499 --> 01:21:03,490
All right.

688
01:21:07,004 --> 01:21:09,336
Now that she's breathing her last,
she's remembering me.

689
01:21:12,677 --> 01:21:16,169
No matter what happens,
I'll not see her face.

690
01:21:18,015 --> 01:21:20,006
Whose face do you refuse to see?

691
01:21:23,187 --> 01:21:24,848
Of my wife.

692
01:21:25,523 --> 01:21:28,014
Respected father.
My greetings to you.

693
01:21:28,693 --> 01:21:30,684
Mother is breathing her last.

694
01:21:31,195 --> 01:21:33,356
Both of you stayed separately
all your life.

695
01:21:33,864 --> 01:21:37,027
During old age, one needs to meet
your near and dear ones.

696
01:21:37,702 --> 01:21:41,035
If you come, mother might get
the desire to live once again.

697
01:21:41,706 --> 01:21:43,697
Your daughter, Sandhya.

698
01:21:49,113 --> 01:21:51,104
You're giving vent to your fury
by throwing away the letter...

699
01:21:52,383 --> 01:21:53,645
...or are you accepting
your regrets?

700
01:21:53,884 --> 01:21:57,376
Neither do I have any regrets,
nor sm I angry about anything.

701
01:22:00,224 --> 01:22:03,057
She went away because ofher ego.

702
01:22:04,729 --> 01:22:07,061
My ego too is intact till date.

703
01:22:07,732 --> 01:22:10,724
That's why even till the last day,
my decision will remain intact.

704
01:22:12,470 --> 01:22:14,461
She's not the first woman on earth
who's breathing her last.

705
01:22:16,073 --> 01:22:18,064
Nobody is immortal.

706
01:22:18,576 --> 01:22:20,567
But she's your first and last wife.

707
01:22:21,412 --> 01:22:23,744
You may not go, if you like.
But I'll definitely go there.

708
01:22:27,918 --> 01:22:31,752
You may go if you want to be
insulted in your youth.

709
01:22:33,924 --> 01:22:39,089
You'll start hating women thereafter.
- I don't love a woman even now.

710
01:22:39,930 --> 01:22:44,094
But I would like
to meet the woman who...

711
01:22:44,168 --> 01:22:47,763
defied nature for my sake.

712
01:23:22,807 --> 01:23:24,798
Both of you should go home now.
- Why?

713
01:23:24,875 --> 01:23:26,866
We'll go once you board the train.

714
01:23:26,977 --> 01:23:28,968
Have you come to see me off
or to have a stroll?

715
01:23:29,313 --> 01:23:32,646
- You've begun once again.
- I'll start later.

716
01:23:33,818 --> 01:23:35,979
Here's your bag. The bag
contains letters.

717
01:23:36,654 --> 01:23:39,316
Keep sending me the empty envelopes.
I'll assume that all's well.

718
01:23:39,657 --> 01:23:41,648
If you don't get the letters, you may
assume that the woman has died.

719
01:23:44,161 --> 01:23:46,322
All right. I'm leaving.
Take care of yourseif.

720
01:23:46,831 --> 01:23:48,162
Let's go.

721
01:25:40,444 --> 01:25:42,435
Let's escape from here.

722
01:26:54,518 --> 01:26:57,851
I'm leaving town.

723
01:26:59,023 --> 01:27:00,183
But it's you who have left
behind your luggage.

724
01:27:02,026 --> 01:27:04,017
They're crooks. They'll die.

725
01:27:04,528 --> 01:27:09,192
You'll kill them.
I'm happy.

726
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:12,191
I didn't send them to kill you.

727
01:27:13,203 --> 01:27:15,433
I'd sent them so that you meet
me before you leave.

728
01:27:16,874 --> 01:27:18,364
Where are you going
without informing me?

729
01:27:20,878 --> 01:27:22,869
I did not inform when I was born.

730
01:27:24,381 --> 01:27:26,872
Moreover, some people only understand
the language of violence.

731
01:27:31,455 --> 01:27:34,447
Don't you worry. This small bag cannot
contain one crore rupees.

732
01:27:35,059 --> 01:27:37,050
You're intelligent.

733
01:27:37,227 --> 01:27:39,889
You'll hand over the money to
someone close to you.

734
01:27:39,964 --> 01:27:44,230
You'll make others put up with
trouble by going away.

735
01:27:49,907 --> 01:27:51,898
Your own people are traitors.

736
01:27:52,576 --> 01:27:54,237
They want to conspire with me
and deprive you of your kingdom.

737
01:27:54,578 --> 01:27:58,070
I know. You never lie.

738
01:27:59,083 --> 01:28:01,074
You don't lie to anybody.

739
01:28:02,086 --> 01:28:05,078
Tell me the name of the person
who's begun to hate his life.

740
01:28:07,591 --> 01:28:09,422
Who was the person who encouraged
you to lend me the money?

741
01:28:10,594 --> 01:28:14,086
And who told you that you can never
be betrayed by a person...

742
01:28:14,932 --> 01:28:16,923
...who's willing to offer himseif
in return for money?

743
01:28:18,268 --> 01:28:20,259
Your man has betrayed you.

744
01:28:28,612 --> 01:28:31,274
So the minister is the traitor!

745
01:28:34,284 --> 01:28:37,776
What's all this? Your bodyguards
have killed my men?

746
01:28:38,622 --> 01:28:40,613
Go and sit on the chair.

747
01:28:43,627 --> 01:28:46,460
Are you honouring me, or
are you preparing to punish me?

748
01:28:46,964 --> 01:28:48,955
You compromised for money.

749
01:28:50,634 --> 01:28:54,798
I'll kill you on the basis
of my principles and rules.

750
01:28:55,639 --> 01:28:58,472
You've to sit on this chair.
Sit down, will you?

751
01:29:04,481 --> 01:29:08,815
Continue to beat him...

752
01:29:08,886 --> 01:29:11,320
round-the-clock.

753
01:29:42,686 --> 01:29:44,847
I was confident that
you'll surely come.

754
01:29:45,522 --> 01:29:47,513
Please come inside.

755
01:29:48,525 --> 01:29:51,858
Sit down here.
- But how did you recognise me?

756
01:29:52,362 --> 01:29:55,854
Strangers don't visit a place
which is experiencing bad times.

757
01:29:56,533 --> 01:30:00,697
You never enquired about us. But
Shloka always wrote to us.

758
01:30:01,205 --> 01:30:03,196
That's the reason why he
loaded with so may letters.

759
01:30:03,707 --> 01:30:04,469
Where's your mother?

760
01:30:04,641 --> 01:30:06,700
She dozed away while waiting
for the meals to be ready.

761
01:30:07,211 --> 01:30:09,202
You rest for a while.
I'll cook something.

762
01:30:47,751 --> 01:30:49,742
Your mother stayed away from her
husband all her life.

763
01:30:50,087 --> 01:30:52,248
And you're stealing her
only memento before her death?

764
01:30:52,456 --> 01:30:54,447
You don't believe in relationships.

765
01:30:55,092 --> 01:30:57,083
So on what authority
did you slap me?

766
01:30:57,261 --> 01:30:59,252
- Tell me.
- I don't know.

767
01:30:59,463 --> 01:31:05,424
But I do know. And I'm glad that my
brother has come to protect me.

768
01:31:06,436 --> 01:31:09,769
I agree that by selling my mother's
sacred necklace, I would be mistaken.

769
01:31:10,440 --> 01:31:13,773
But the truth is that instead of
keeping my brother hungry...

770
01:31:14,611 --> 01:31:19,105
..I would not have hesitated to
dispose off my own sacred necklace.

771
01:31:19,449 --> 01:31:21,440
Take this sacred necklace.

772
01:31:23,020 --> 01:31:25,955
Hold this envelope, and look how
many sheets of paper it contains.

773
01:31:26,623 --> 01:31:28,284
Go and sell it off somewhere.

774
01:31:28,458 --> 01:31:30,449
If you can fetch four rupees out of
it, I'll make it multiply into forty.

775
01:31:35,132 --> 01:31:36,895
It contains lot of money.

776
01:31:37,301 --> 01:31:39,963
He's a wretch, really.

777
01:31:41,038 --> 01:31:42,027
He gave me money in the guise
ofletters.

778
01:31:46,143 --> 01:31:48,134
Hold this.

779
01:31:50,480 --> 01:31:52,641
Mother, look! Ajay has come.

780
01:32:00,490 --> 01:32:04,984
Here's your sacred necklace.
Rat the food.

781
01:32:08,498 --> 01:32:12,332
Why've you come? Why've you come?

782
01:32:13,837 --> 01:32:16,670
You robbed me of my husband
the moment you were born.

783
01:32:18,675 --> 01:32:21,508
Are you trying to oblige us
by returning me my sacred necklace?

784
01:32:22,512 --> 01:32:24,503
What'll you call me?

785
01:32:25,515 --> 01:32:26,345
Will you address me
as Sandhya's mother?

786
01:32:27,517 --> 01:32:30,008
Only my husband has the right
to address me likewise.

787
01:32:31,355 --> 01:32:34,017
How about her? Will you call her
the daughter of Parvati?

788
01:32:34,858 --> 01:32:37,349
Only the village folk have the
right to address her likewise.

789
01:32:37,694 --> 01:32:39,355
What's your relation with us?

790
01:32:40,364 --> 01:32:42,855
He doesn't belong to anyone.

791
01:32:43,367 --> 01:32:47,360
Get out! Go back to the city
where you robbed me of everything.

792
01:32:48,872 --> 01:32:50,863
I've no complaints against
my husband...

793
01:32:51,208 --> 01:32:53,199
...even ifhe hasn't come
to see my face.

794
01:32:53,877 --> 01:32:59,042
It's you whom I hate who caused
me to separate from my husband.

795
01:33:00,217 --> 01:33:04,051
I hate you.
Go away from here.

796
01:33:06,390 --> 01:33:08,381
O Lord!

797
01:33:08,792 --> 01:33:10,783
Stop!

798
01:33:11,561 --> 01:33:13,552
Listen to me once.
You may go thereafter.

799
01:33:14,398 --> 01:33:16,389
My mother has lost her husband
in her lifetime.

800
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:18,991
Don't treat her frustrations
as criticism.

801
01:33:19,569 --> 01:33:25,064
If you go away now, she'll think that
she lost her husband 20 years ago...

802
01:33:26,410 --> 01:33:28,401
...and 20 years later, she lost
her son too.

803
01:33:29,913 --> 01:33:32,074
Stay back! Don't go!

804
01:34:21,492 --> 01:34:23,483
How is he?

805
01:34:24,829 --> 01:34:26,990
He has grown old.
He has retired too.

806
01:34:28,332 --> 01:34:30,323
He receives pension, which is
sufficient for livelihood.

807
01:34:32,169 --> 01:34:34,160
- What do you do?
- I don't know.

808
01:34:36,006 --> 01:34:37,997
Are you angry with me,
like my husband is?

809
01:34:39,677 --> 01:34:41,668
My husband is a very sincere person.

810
01:34:42,847 --> 01:34:44,838
He's living up to his word about
hating me for ever.

811
01:34:46,183 --> 01:34:48,014
If you meet him, ask him to...

812
01:34:48,085 --> 01:34:51,179
...love me with as much dedication
in his next birth.

813
01:34:51,689 --> 01:34:55,022
This life isn't over yet. And you're
planning about your next life?

814
01:34:56,694 --> 01:34:59,857
Didn't he tell you how I'd cursed
you in your childhood?

815
01:35:01,198 --> 01:35:03,189
It was you who spoke the truth
for the first time.

816
01:35:04,535 --> 01:35:06,526
The entire world repeated the ssme
thing in different ways.

817
01:35:08,873 --> 01:35:12,707
You must be feeling hurt by
hearing the harsh words of others?

818
01:35:14,545 --> 01:35:17,708
I can know that only if I know
what peace is all about.

819
01:35:21,552 --> 01:35:25,386
Tell me, how did you come over
as soon as you got the letter?

820
01:35:26,724 --> 01:35:30,387
I came to meet you.
But you were upset with me.

821
01:35:31,896 --> 01:35:33,887
Why've you come to comfort me?

822
01:35:34,899 --> 01:35:36,890
I'm a mother, after all.

823
01:35:37,568 --> 01:35:40,901
The woman who dumped me in a gutter
was a mother too!

824
01:35:42,239 --> 01:35:45,072
No, son. I wouldn't like the image
of a mother to be soiled.

825
01:35:46,243 --> 01:35:48,074
So I'll give you shelter
in my lap.

826
01:35:48,913 --> 01:35:52,405
- Will you sleep in my lap?
- Can one sleep in the lap?

827
01:35:54,585 --> 01:35:56,917
During a lifetime, a person
can sleep only twice.

828
01:35:58,589 --> 01:36:00,580
Once when he is breathing
his last.

829
01:36:01,091 --> 01:36:03,082
...and again when he's in
a mother's lap.

830
01:36:04,261 --> 01:36:06,422
Rither he sleeps away
when he dies...

831
01:36:07,765 --> 01:36:10,097
...or he sleeps in the mother's
lap and settles down in life.

832
01:36:11,268 --> 01:36:13,759
What's this? You're weeping?.

833
01:36:17,775 --> 01:36:19,766
I understood a thing today.

834
01:36:21,278 --> 01:36:23,269
That tears don't come out
only on special occasions.

835
01:36:24,615 --> 01:36:27,778
When I did not have a mother,
I used to cry.

836
01:36:28,953 --> 01:36:32,445
And now that I've a mother,
I'm still crying.

837
01:36:42,800 --> 01:36:47,464
In the next seven days, you'll have
to cover a distance of seven years.

838
01:36:48,973 --> 01:36:52,136
If you can collaborate with the
visiting delegates of...

839
01:36:52,209 --> 01:36:56,145
...the multinational companies, and
make new establishments...

840
01:36:56,647 --> 01:36:58,638
...you would never have to
look back in life.

841
01:36:58,816 --> 01:36:59,805
Take this.

842
01:37:03,988 --> 01:37:06,149
This is my final test.

843
01:37:45,195 --> 01:37:47,857
By finalising these assignments,
you've proved that...

844
01:37:48,365 --> 01:37:52,358
...not only are you a topper in
studies, but a top businessman too.

845
01:37:53,037 --> 01:37:56,871
Now Shloka will not stay with you,
but with me.

846
01:37:57,708 --> 01:38:00,199
But not in this town. Somewhere
far away from here.

847
01:42:14,531 --> 01:42:19,798
I've realised that everyone with power
is sure to end up like this.

848
01:42:21,638 --> 01:42:25,802
My next seven generations will not
accept any power or authority.

849
01:42:27,311 --> 01:42:33,477
But for which crime of mine
are you punishing me?

850
01:42:33,984 --> 01:42:37,647
You've cheated me.

851
01:42:38,322 --> 01:42:41,155
And I punish cheaters
with my own hands.

852
01:42:43,327 --> 01:42:44,316
Stop!

853
01:42:48,165 --> 01:42:51,328
How has he cheated you?
What has he cheated you of/.

854
01:42:52,502 --> 01:42:54,663
You're killing your loyal man
without investigations.

855
01:42:55,005 --> 01:42:56,996
I've full faith in Ajay's honesty.

856
01:42:57,674 --> 01:42:59,835
He never speaks a lie.

857
01:43:01,345 --> 01:43:02,334
What did Ajay say?

858
01:43:19,696 --> 01:43:22,859
As my guarnatee, i'm giving you 
charge of all my assets.

859
01:43:24,034 --> 01:43:26,025
Allow me a time of 30 days.

860
01:43:26,536 --> 01:43:29,369
I'll prove to you as to
who's honest, and who's not?

861
01:43:32,809 --> 01:43:36,210
Ajay washed away my years
ofhonesty.

862
01:43:43,053 --> 01:43:45,544
We'll have to bring back the money
from that scoundrel.

863
01:43:47,224 --> 01:43:50,887
The false impression
about Ajay's...

864
01:43:51,728 --> 01:43:54,720
honesty in Ikka's mind...
will have to be corrected.

865
01:43:58,235 --> 01:44:02,569
I'm backing you for the simple
reason that he can play...

866
01:44:03,407 --> 01:44:05,398
...the ssme dirty game with me
with which he tried to victimise you.

867
01:44:05,575 --> 01:44:10,069
Investigate about the people who're
helping him in his activities.

868
01:44:11,248 --> 01:44:15,241
My first suspect is
his foster father.

869
01:44:15,585 --> 01:44:21,080
Of course! We should reply to him
with equal force. Break him!

870
01:44:26,263 --> 01:44:28,925
Did your son gamble?
- Yes.

871
01:44:31,601 --> 01:44:33,592
Where has he kept the money?

872
01:44:41,778 --> 01:44:44,269
I don't know.

873
01:44:46,116 --> 01:44:51,019
Sir, we've searched his entire house.
But we couldn't find the money.

874
01:44:53,223 --> 01:44:54,281
Let him go.

875
01:44:59,796 --> 01:45:02,287
Now there's only the friend of Ajay.

876
01:45:03,800 --> 01:45:06,792
His mother has quite a hold
smong prostitutes.

877
01:45:08,305 --> 01:45:13,299
We'll have to trap her with a
little dose of politics.

878
01:45:14,811 --> 01:45:15,573
How'll that be?

879
01:45:16,146 --> 01:45:17,704
We're social workers.

880
01:45:17,814 --> 01:45:21,807
We need your assistance in our drive
for the elimination of prostitution.

881
01:45:22,652 --> 01:45:24,643
But how can I help you?

882
01:45:25,322 --> 01:45:28,485
You've quite a say in the locality.
Rverybody respects you.

883
01:45:28,825 --> 01:45:31,817
If you accompany us during our visits
from door-to-door...

884
01:45:32,329 --> 01:45:34,320
...we'll be able to present our ideas
to them very easily.

885
01:45:34,731 --> 01:45:37,666
All right. Please be seated.
I'll change and come.

886
01:45:46,343 --> 01:45:48,334
- What's the matter?
- We've been informed that...

887
01:45:48,411 --> 01:45:50,675
...prostitution is carried out
in this place. Yes.

888
01:45:50,847 --> 01:45:55,011
If one doesn't believe it, the girls
and the customers are present here.

889
01:45:56,019 --> 01:45:57,281
I'm arresting you.

890
01:45:57,354 --> 01:46:01,017
You'd better scare your own daughters.

891
01:46:01,358 --> 01:46:06,523
How did you dare
to enter our house...

892
01:46:06,630 --> 01:46:09,360
which is looked upon with respect?

893
01:46:09,533 --> 01:46:12,195
- Whatever you want to say...
- I'll speak and you'll listen.

894
01:46:12,869 --> 01:46:16,202
I'm speaking from experience that
it's because of the police stations...

895
01:46:16,373 --> 01:46:18,364
...that homes become brothels.

896
01:46:18,708 --> 01:46:21,199
Neither are they prostitutes,
nor are they males.

897
01:46:21,711 --> 01:46:24,703
Will you prove me as a brothel-keeper
on the basis of these limps?

898
01:46:25,215 --> 01:46:31,051
Rven the prostitutes have no
faith in policemen now.

899
01:46:31,388 --> 01:46:35,222
I'll see what you can do, or what
your court can do. Let's go.

900
01:46:35,559 --> 01:46:37,550
First I'll arrest you.
And then I'll search your house.

901
01:46:43,233 --> 01:46:45,224
Look what the police is doing.

902
01:46:47,404 --> 01:46:50,066
Stop! O prostitutes!

903
01:46:50,907 --> 01:46:54,399
You're scared by a simple glance
at the policeman.

904
01:46:54,911 --> 01:46:56,902
But where did you get the courage
to confront us today?

905
01:46:56,980 --> 01:47:00,245
We'll not hide if we've to save her.
But we've keep a distance from you.

906
01:47:01,585 --> 01:47:03,746
A pimp has to be paid a commission.
And you've to be paid a bribe.

907
01:47:03,987 --> 01:47:06,751
So you'll prevent me
from taking her away?

908
01:47:07,424 --> 01:47:10,916
She's the pride of our community.
Do not insult her.

909
01:47:19,836 --> 01:47:21,827
i'm incharge of kamthipura
palice station.

910
01:47:22,439 --> 01:47:24,430
How did you arrest her
without seeking my permission?

911
01:47:24,774 --> 01:47:27,436
How did you enter her house?

912
01:47:30,280 --> 01:47:32,441
I'll answer you
in the court oflaw.

913
01:47:32,716 --> 01:47:34,775
which court will you take him to?

914
01:47:35,285 --> 01:47:37,776
He cannot be tried in the
court ofhumanity.

915
01:47:38,622 --> 01:47:40,613
His case can be fought
in the court of the almighty.

916
01:47:41,291 --> 01:47:43,054
Why did God have to
make him so ill-fated?

917
01:47:43,293 --> 01:47:45,784
- Who the hell are you?
- You'd better talk with etiquette.

918
01:47:46,296 --> 01:47:48,787
Can you never be courteous
when communicating with people?

919
01:47:49,466 --> 01:47:53,129
Would your power be reduced if
you start using etiquette?

920
01:47:53,470 --> 01:47:56,803
- So you've come to rescue her?
- Here are the documents.

921
01:47:57,140 --> 01:48:00,473
I've come to release her.
These are the bail documents.

922
01:48:01,311 --> 01:48:05,475
And remember that I'll file a
defamation suit against you.

923
01:48:05,982 --> 01:48:09,145
Your uniform will be auctioned
in this very market.

924
01:48:11,988 --> 01:48:13,979
Let's go, mother.

925
01:48:19,496 --> 01:48:21,987
The policemen searched
the entire house.

926
01:48:22,165 --> 01:48:22,494
And then they attacked our house.

927
01:48:25,502 --> 01:48:28,164
But what enmity do they have with us?

928
01:48:29,506 --> 01:48:35,843
The root cause is the one crore
which Ajay had won in gambling.

929
01:48:37,013 --> 01:48:39,004
God knows where the money went.

930
01:48:39,683 --> 01:48:42,015
But the attacks are bound
to continue in future too.

931
01:48:43,520 --> 01:48:45,511
You wanted to win me over with
money earned through gambling?.

932
01:48:46,523 --> 01:48:49,185
A house can be ruined by money
earned through gambling.

933
01:48:50,026 --> 01:48:55,020
In future, you could put me
at stake too.

934
01:48:55,532 --> 01:48:59,024
I'd forgotten that you're big people,
while I'm an ordinary person.

935
01:48:59,703 --> 01:49:00,533
Please forgive me.

936
01:49:01,705 --> 01:49:06,870
But the truth is that even if I've
to abandon my relationship with you...

937
01:49:07,877 --> 01:49:11,210
...I wouldn't marry at the cost of
death of Ajay and his father.

938
01:49:13,049 --> 01:49:17,213
I can sacrifice anything
for their sake.

939
01:49:18,054 --> 01:49:23,390
You may deliver this money
at Shloka's house.

940
01:49:24,060 --> 01:49:27,223
You won the money through gambling.
But you lost for your relations.

941
01:49:27,731 --> 01:49:29,722
You're the owner of this company.

942
01:49:30,066 --> 01:49:32,557
But you neither treated us nor the
money as your own.

943
01:49:32,736 --> 01:49:35,227
Or else, you could've taken as much
as wanted without asking for it.

944
01:49:35,905 --> 01:49:37,896
My daughter hasn't
experienced poverty.

945
01:49:38,074 --> 01:49:42,238
And those who've everything in
life, they cannot feel the lack of it.

946
01:49:42,746 --> 01:49:44,737
Please forgive my daughter.

947
01:49:47,083 --> 01:49:49,074
I should be leaving now.

948
01:49:51,087 --> 01:49:55,581
You can find such seif-respecting
people only smong the poor.

949
01:49:56,760 --> 01:49:58,921
He's not a dismond,
which one can find.

950
01:50:00,096 --> 01:50:02,428
He's a human being,
a rare commodity these days.

951
01:50:28,358 --> 01:50:30,952
Here are your one crore rupees.

952
01:50:31,961 --> 01:50:34,122
Ajay wouldn't have visited
any casino...

953
01:50:35,465 --> 01:50:37,456
...if I'd not needed the money.

954
01:50:39,469 --> 01:50:41,460
Your money has reached you now.

955
01:50:43,306 --> 01:50:45,638
You should stop your
atrocities on us henceforth.

956
01:50:46,643 --> 01:50:52,809
Neither of us know each other
from now onwards.

957
01:50:56,986 --> 01:51:00,319
Cool down.
And let us live with peace.

958
01:51:11,501 --> 01:51:13,492
He's not forgiving me.

959
01:51:14,003 --> 01:51:15,994
I've come to my in-laws place
by walking all the way.

960
01:51:16,673 --> 01:51:21,838
Your abode is within my heart.
Not in this market.

961
01:51:23,847 --> 01:51:25,838
He's crazy. Why don't you sit?

962
01:51:27,183 --> 01:51:29,344
Now that he has returned
the money, I'm at ease.

963
01:51:30,854 --> 01:51:33,345
Rverything will be fine now.

964
01:51:35,358 --> 01:51:37,519
Ajay has been exposed.

965
01:51:38,094 --> 01:51:41,860
He had tried to create a conflict
between...

966
01:51:41,931 --> 01:51:45,697
...politics, police and
the trouble-makers.

967
01:51:47,203 --> 01:51:51,697
But we played such a game that
we could recover our wealth.

968
01:51:55,044 --> 01:52:00,380
As long as we remain united,
democracry will remain alive.

969
01:52:01,317 --> 01:52:03,308
But I don't understand something.

970
01:52:04,554 --> 01:52:08,388
On such occasions, there should be
brightness and fireworks all around.

971
01:52:08,892 --> 01:52:10,883
You've surrounded yourseif
with darkness. Why so?

972
01:52:18,568 --> 01:52:24,234
My trust has been betrayed.
Ajay, of all people, cheated me.

973
01:52:25,575 --> 01:52:28,908
I continued to pardon him
for all his mistakes.

974
01:52:30,413 --> 01:52:34,577
I displayed some oneness to
somebody for the last time.

975
01:52:36,586 --> 01:52:38,577
And he rejected me?

976
01:52:44,761 --> 01:52:48,754
The fool doesn't realise that
I'm such a smake...

977
01:52:49,432 --> 01:52:52,424
...which is filled with poison
in my entire body.

978
01:52:55,939 --> 01:53:02,105
O Lord! Give him the courage
to tolerate my poison.

979
01:53:23,466 --> 01:53:26,299
Smake!
You've been bitten by a smake!

980
01:53:26,970 --> 01:53:28,961
- Brother!
- What happened?

981
01:53:32,475 --> 01:53:35,638
- Brother has been bitten by a smake.
- No.

982
01:53:36,312 --> 01:53:38,473
Go and call the doctor
immediately.

983
01:53:44,320 --> 01:53:48,654
You'll have to live.
It's nothing.

984
01:53:50,660 --> 01:53:52,321
Show me.

985
01:54:43,046 --> 01:54:46,038
- Why is medicine not curing her?
- She was a heart patient already.

986
01:54:46,482 --> 01:54:48,473
Now poison has spread
all over her body.

987
01:54:49,052 --> 01:54:51,714
It's a stage of coma.
I'm helpless now.

988
01:54:52,055 --> 01:54:53,886
You can kill yourseif
with poison, at least.

989
01:54:54,057 --> 01:54:56,048
Has your medicine died
before she could?

990
01:54:56,159 --> 01:54:58,719
Lift your bag and get lost.

991
01:55:01,831 --> 01:55:05,562
She won't get up
if you weep.

992
01:55:06,736 --> 01:55:09,728
- Why're you standing here?
- My fees?

993
01:55:09,906 --> 01:55:12,898
Here! Take it and get lost.

994
01:55:13,409 --> 01:55:18,574
And listen! She'll rise today.
She'll rise soon.

995
01:55:24,253 --> 01:55:26,244
She'll rise.

996
01:55:28,091 --> 01:55:30,753
Rise! Rise!

997
01:55:32,662 --> 01:55:34,653
Rise! Rise!

998
01:55:37,433 --> 01:55:38,422
Mother!

999
01:55:41,437 --> 01:55:43,428
Mother!

1000
01:55:46,109 --> 01:55:48,100
Mother!

1001
01:55:50,613 --> 01:55:52,604
Mother!

1002
01:55:59,956 --> 01:56:02,789
You called me out?

1003
01:56:05,027 --> 01:56:07,018
Yes, mother.

1004
01:56:07,296 --> 01:56:09,628
Rvery mother serves milk
to her child.

1005
01:56:11,467 --> 01:56:13,458
You sucked in all the poison
from my body.

1006
01:56:14,971 --> 01:56:19,135
To teach me the value of relations,
you found a easy way out.

1007
01:56:20,143 --> 01:56:21,132
Why?

1008
01:56:22,812 --> 01:56:26,976
Rven as I die, will you
make me cry?

1009
01:56:27,817 --> 01:56:30,149
Don't speak like this.

1010
01:56:32,155 --> 01:56:35,488
Will you promise me
whatever I ask for?

1011
01:56:36,492 --> 01:56:37,481
Ask for it.

1012
01:56:38,494 --> 01:56:42,988
You should be responsible
for Sandhya's marriage.

1013
01:56:46,002 --> 01:56:49,665
You light my funeral pyre.

1014
01:56:52,008 --> 01:56:54,169
And I promise you that...

1015
01:56:56,179 --> 01:57:00,513
...in my next birth, I'll give you
birth from my own womb.

1016
01:57:33,049 --> 01:57:35,040
How do I look?

1017
01:57:35,551 --> 01:57:39,385
This car, this suit...
You look dashing.

1018
01:57:40,056 --> 01:57:43,890
I've already finished my work.
I used to wait for you at the station.

1019
01:57:45,061 --> 01:57:46,892
Tell me, how is Sandhya's mother?

1020
01:57:47,230 --> 01:57:48,720
Mother is dead.

1021
01:57:56,239 --> 01:58:02,906
She's Sandhya. And he's your
news brother, who wrote letters.

1022
01:58:04,413 --> 01:58:08,076
I thought you never
valued relationships.

1023
01:58:08,918 --> 01:58:10,909
Now I've started respecting
relationships.

1024
01:58:16,592 --> 01:58:19,254
How're you? You've returned
from the village?

1025
01:58:21,430 --> 01:58:25,594
What's happened to you?

1026
01:58:28,271 --> 01:58:33,766
Those people call me a mad person.
Am I a mad person?

1027
01:58:35,111 --> 01:58:37,102
Yes.

1028
01:58:37,280 --> 01:58:42,445
Those who serve the world,
are known as mad.

1029
01:58:44,520 --> 01:58:49,287
Why do you take me there
repeatedly?

1030
01:58:50,793 --> 01:58:52,784
Hey, girl!

1031
01:58:54,130 --> 01:58:56,792
You're a policeman, aren't you?

1032
01:58:57,300 --> 01:59:02,465
Protect her. Or else, she'll be...

1033
01:59:03,639 --> 01:59:05,971
Do protect her.

1034
01:59:09,478 --> 01:59:10,467
Constable!

1035
01:59:14,984 --> 01:59:16,975
You've returned from the village
a dejected man?

1036
01:59:17,987 --> 01:59:19,978
You've fulfilled your desire
ofbeing insulted?

1037
01:59:20,323 --> 01:59:23,815
I've brought the honour
of your family alongwith me.

1038
01:59:29,165 --> 01:59:31,156
- Who's she?
- I thought a father...

1039
01:59:31,233 --> 01:59:33,224
...doesn't forget her daughter
even after she's married.

1040
01:59:33,669 --> 01:59:35,660
But you forgot your daughter
even before you met her.

1041
01:59:40,977 --> 01:59:42,968
You remember her name?

1042
01:59:43,179 --> 01:59:45,170
You've done a great favour
to the community of fathers.

1043
01:59:46,349 --> 01:59:50,843
Now, let me also inform you
that Sandhya's mother is no more.

1044
02:00:04,200 --> 02:00:06,862
It's good that she passed away.

1045
02:00:11,040 --> 02:00:14,703
Such a seif-respecting woman
should've died a married woman.

1046
02:00:15,711 --> 02:00:18,373
I've promised her that
I'll get Sandhya married.

1047
02:00:19,382 --> 02:00:21,373
I've already lost the shelter
of my mother.

1048
02:00:22,051 --> 02:00:24,212
Can I expect shelter
in your place?

1049
02:00:28,724 --> 02:00:30,715
How can you say that?

1050
02:00:31,060 --> 02:00:36,225
This house belongs to you.

1051
02:00:37,400 --> 02:00:41,894
I've suffered a lot
by losing you.

1052
02:00:45,741 --> 02:00:50,906
You see, Ajay'll ensure that
you're married off.

1053
02:00:52,748 --> 02:00:58,584
I mistook my false
ego to be my pride.

1054
02:01:00,089 --> 02:01:03,081
This is my punishment.
- No, it'll be your atonement, father.

1055
02:01:11,767 --> 02:01:16,101
Repeat it again. What did you say?

1056
02:01:17,106 --> 02:01:20,269
In old age, ears can mistake things.

1057
02:01:23,446 --> 02:01:25,277
I've told you once, father.

1058
02:01:27,450 --> 02:01:30,283
The almighty is giving me
so many pleasures today.

1059
02:01:33,456 --> 02:01:37,449
I believed that you would never
address me as your father....

1060
02:01:38,794 --> 02:01:40,785
...even after I breathe my last.

1061
02:01:41,297 --> 02:01:44,460
Father, I want to ask you
a question.

1062
02:01:45,468 --> 02:01:48,631
Mother remembered you every moment
ofher life.

1063
02:01:49,972 --> 02:01:51,963
Did you never remember her?

1064
02:01:57,146 --> 02:01:59,137
Remember her?

1065
02:02:05,321 --> 02:02:11,988
I don't even remember how much
I remembered her.

1066
02:02:14,830 --> 02:02:18,664
That mad woman told you
her heart's desire...

1067
02:02:20,836 --> 02:02:22,827
...but she couldn't hear
my weeps.

1068
02:02:24,173 --> 02:02:28,007
Today you've all been united.

1069
02:02:28,677 --> 02:02:31,339
Tomorrow will mark a new beginning.

1070
02:02:31,580 --> 02:02:35,016
Two bosses will sit here.
You and myseif.

1071
02:02:37,520 --> 02:02:41,354
Let me see how my friend
looks seated on the boss chair?

1072
02:02:56,038 --> 02:02:58,029
Mother!

1073
02:02:59,375 --> 02:03:00,364
Mother!

1074
02:03:13,556 --> 02:03:19,392
Didn't you understand?
He's calling you. Yes, go!

1075
02:03:25,234 --> 02:03:30,570
You...You never addressed me
like this earlier.

1076
02:03:32,241 --> 02:03:34,232
When one curses somebody
all her life...

1077
02:03:34,410 --> 02:03:36,401
...and then calls the person
by her real name...

1078
02:03:36,745 --> 02:03:37,905
...the person is sure
to be taken by surprise.

1079
02:04:39,141 --> 02:04:40,972
We've only one demand.

1080
02:04:41,076 --> 02:04:44,477
We would be happy if our son marries
the girl and brings her home.

1081
02:04:44,813 --> 02:04:46,804
That'll be enough.

1082
02:04:47,483 --> 02:04:48,973
No, mother. I've some conditions.

1083
02:04:51,654 --> 02:04:54,145
The first condition is that the girl
would not fetch any dowry...

1084
02:04:54,223 --> 02:04:56,487
...except the costume that she
wears at the time of ceremony.

1085
02:04:59,995 --> 02:05:02,225
My second condition is that a maximum
of one rupees, twenty five paise...

1086
02:05:02,331 --> 02:05:04,663
...will be spent towards expenditure
during the marriage ceremony.

1087
02:05:05,501 --> 02:05:07,492
I too have a condition.

1088
02:05:08,337 --> 02:05:10,828
Our daughter should be sent off
from our new house.

1089
02:05:11,840 --> 02:05:14,001
The marriage and the house-warming
ceremony'll be held simultaneously.

1090
02:05:14,510 --> 02:05:17,172
Now that the conditions are fulfilled,
what's the delay for?

1091
02:05:18,013 --> 02:05:23,849
Make my sister so happy after marriage,
that she forgets all her miseries.

1092
02:05:25,354 --> 02:05:28,517
It's my humble request to you.

1093
02:05:31,527 --> 02:05:33,688
Both of you'd better pay attention
to the dinner arrangements.

1094
02:05:35,030 --> 02:05:39,524
Start the ceremony for house-warming
only after they arrive here.

1095
02:05:39,702 --> 02:05:41,693
Thereafter the procession will arrive
and the marriage will take place.

1096
02:05:42,371 --> 02:05:44,532
You've repeated it ten times
ever since this morning.

1097
02:05:45,708 --> 02:05:51,704
Ajay and Uncle will stay with us.
And Sandhya will go with her husband.

1098
02:05:55,718 --> 02:05:57,379
Keep these things too.

1099
02:06:18,040 --> 02:06:20,235
This is the authority letter
of my bank.

1100
02:06:20,743 --> 02:06:23,576
I've deposited some ornaments there.
Go and fetch them.

1101
02:06:24,580 --> 02:06:27,572
It's Sandhya's marriage today.
I'm her father.

1102
02:06:28,083 --> 02:06:29,914
I cannot marry her off
without gifting her something.

1103
02:06:30,586 --> 02:06:32,577
Where did you get the money
to buy the ornaments?

1104
02:06:36,425 --> 02:06:41,089
So what if I starved myself?.
I'd saved...

1105
02:06:44,433 --> 02:06:47,596
... for what rightfully
belonged to the child.

1106
02:06:49,605 --> 02:06:51,937
If it would've been a son, I would've
given it to my daughter-in-law.

1107
02:06:53,442 --> 02:06:56,934
If it were a daughter, I would
give it to her in marriage.

1108
02:06:57,346 --> 02:06:59,337
You're very clever, father.

1109
02:06:59,448 --> 02:07:02,781
I'm performing the ceremony.
But you'll derive the benefits.

1110
02:07:43,659 --> 02:07:46,321
We've come to fetch your daughter.

1111
02:07:47,162 --> 02:07:49,153
We're the bridegrooms.

1112
02:07:49,264 --> 02:07:52,495
Where is your daughter?

1113
02:07:52,901 --> 02:07:58,999
I'm still strong enough
to confront you!

1114
02:08:12,187 --> 02:08:15,020
Leave my father!

1115
02:08:24,032 --> 02:08:26,523
Leave my father!

1116
02:08:35,544 --> 02:08:36,533
Daughter!

1117
02:08:43,218 --> 02:08:44,708
Father!

1118
02:08:47,055 --> 02:08:48,044
Don't kill him.

1119
02:08:50,392 --> 02:08:51,552
No!

1120
02:09:02,738 --> 02:09:06,902
- Father!
- Take her. We'll enjoy her today.

1121
02:09:10,078 --> 02:09:11,670
Run!

1122
02:09:34,983 --> 02:09:35,972
How long would she run?

1123
02:09:59,007 --> 02:10:00,167
Father!

1124
02:10:07,248 --> 02:10:09,239
Father!

1125
02:10:11,853 --> 02:10:13,514
Who were they?

1126
02:10:15,857 --> 02:10:17,347
Who were they?

1127
02:10:18,193 --> 02:10:20,184
Tell me.

1128
02:10:25,700 --> 02:10:29,864
Rescue your sister.

1129
02:10:30,705 --> 02:10:33,697
Rescue your sister.

1130
02:10:34,709 --> 02:10:36,700
Rescue your...

1131
02:11:10,378 --> 02:11:11,572
Brother!

1132
02:12:39,834 --> 02:12:41,825
How did it happen?

1133
02:12:42,503 --> 02:12:46,997
You always asked me...

1134
02:12:48,843 --> 02:12:51,175
... if I could hear
the shrieks in the locality.

1135
02:12:54,349 --> 02:12:56,340
I could hear the shrieks today.

1136
02:12:59,020 --> 02:13:03,855
In future, one will not get to hear
anyone shrieking anymore.

1137
02:13:42,563 --> 02:13:44,554
Won't you fulfill the promise
you made to your mother?

1138
02:13:48,736 --> 02:13:51,227
Place her hand in my hand
and fulfill the ceremony.

1139
02:13:53,074 --> 02:13:55,065
It's time for departure.

1140
02:14:42,323 --> 02:14:45,292
Mother, you've come here again.
I wonder what Ajay will do there.

1141
02:14:45,626 --> 02:14:47,617
Neither does he eat, drink
or meet anyone.

1142
02:14:48,296 --> 02:14:52,790
- He refuses to meet me too.
- You won't understand it, son.

1143
02:14:53,134 --> 02:14:58,128
I fear that Ajay might
take to violence and bloodshed.

1144
02:14:58,473 --> 02:15:02,466
- What's the use of it all now?
- I don't know about its uses.

1145
02:15:03,644 --> 02:15:06,807
But if Ajay doesn't return,
your dresm'll never be fulfilled.

1146
02:15:07,148 --> 02:15:09,639
You'll not enter the society
where I've made the houses.

1147
02:15:09,817 --> 02:15:11,978
You'll remain trapped in this filth.
But never ever leave Ajay's company.

1148
02:15:13,755 --> 02:15:17,156
The truth is that though you've
given me birth...

1149
02:15:17,658 --> 02:15:21,321
...you love Ajay more than
you love me. Isn't it true?

1150
02:15:21,662 --> 02:15:26,156
Yes. I love Ajay more than
I love my son.

1151
02:15:30,004 --> 02:15:35,499
Have you observed the rogues,
ruffians and anti-social elements?

1152
02:15:36,444 --> 02:15:40,505
They make the first move in violence
because life is very dear to them.

1153
02:15:41,516 --> 02:15:44,508
But when a decent man
stands up against them...

1154
02:15:45,353 --> 02:15:47,514
...none is greater than him.

1155
02:15:48,689 --> 02:15:50,680
That marks the beginning
of disaster.

1156
02:15:51,192 --> 02:15:53,524
The destruction is yet to begin.

1157
02:15:54,862 --> 02:15:59,697
You can assume his silence to be
an indicator of things to come.

1158
02:16:21,722 --> 02:16:25,556
just like a human being sheds old
clothes and dons new clothes...

1159
02:16:27,395 --> 02:16:32,731
...similarly the soul sheds the
old body and acquires a new one.

1160
02:16:39,907 --> 02:16:44,901
You?
How did you reach here?

1161
02:16:46,080 --> 02:16:49,572
Rise! It's time to die.

1162
02:16:49,917 --> 02:16:56,083
It's time for me to die?
No. I don't wan't to die.

1163
02:16:57,258 --> 02:16:58,589
Where is my security?

1164
02:17:47,975 --> 02:17:52,139
Soul can neither be cut by weapons,
nor can it be burnt by fire.

1165
02:17:53,648 --> 02:17:57,311
Neither can water wet the soul, nor
can air dry it.

1166
02:18:33,020 --> 02:18:35,511
Don't kill me. I don't want to die.

1167
02:19:05,619 --> 02:19:10,556
Neither can it be cut, nor can it be
made wet, or dried.

1168
02:19:11,892 --> 02:19:17,558
It's ever-lasting, omnipresent,...

1169
02:19:19,066 --> 02:19:20,727
... and immortal.

1170
02:19:21,402 --> 02:19:23,393
I've investigated in the
whole of Mumbai underworld.

1171
02:19:24,405 --> 02:19:27,568
Nobody murdered Brahmachari.
Ajay is the murderer.

1172
02:19:28,576 --> 02:19:32,239
I want you to shoot him at sight.

1173
02:19:43,257 --> 02:19:46,590
These are the shoot-at-sight
orders against Ajay.

1174
02:19:51,766 --> 02:19:53,757
Without conducting
any investigations?

1175
02:19:54,101 --> 02:19:57,434
He could be arrested alive.

1176
02:19:57,705 --> 02:20:02,267
He's wanted dead. Nobody
wants to see him alive.

1177
02:20:30,638 --> 02:20:32,299
Why did you bring me here?

1178
02:20:32,406 --> 02:20:34,397
Shoot-at-sight orders have
been issued against you.

1179
02:20:34,475 --> 02:20:36,636
These are your false passport,
visa and ticket.

1180
02:20:36,811 --> 02:20:38,972
You leave for a foreign country.
I've made all the arrangements.

1181
02:20:39,480 --> 02:20:42,142
Why? Are there
no killings abroad?

1182
02:20:43,484 --> 02:20:45,475
If you utter any further nonsense,
I'll commit suicide.

1183
02:20:46,487 --> 02:20:48,478
Take this. Go away quickly.

1184
02:20:49,657 --> 02:20:55,152
No, you cannot go anywhere.
I won't shoot you in public.

1185
02:21:02,236 --> 02:21:05,000
I'll kill you. But I won't
let any harm come to Ajay.

1186
02:21:07,108 --> 02:21:09,099
Please make way.

1187
02:21:22,189 --> 02:21:25,352
Henceforth, neither of us
know each other.

1188
02:21:26,694 --> 02:21:31,688
Once you reach this point, nobody
can stop you from proceeding further.

1189
02:21:33,701 --> 02:21:35,692
This is all I can do for you.

1190
02:21:36,537 --> 02:21:39,370
Go. And never look back.

1191
02:21:40,941 --> 02:21:42,932
Go!

1192
02:22:47,875 --> 02:22:51,276
We're press representatives.
Please reply to our queries.

1193
02:22:51,612 --> 02:22:52,601
Of course.

1194
02:22:53,614 --> 02:22:55,605
Brahmachari was neither in the ruling
party or the opposition.

1195
02:22:55,683 --> 02:22:57,674
Yet you came all the way from Delhi
to offer him homage.

1196
02:22:58,018 --> 02:23:02,284
A minister is a minister,
whatever his political status.

1197
02:23:02,623 --> 02:23:04,784
Moreover, even if we look different
from the outside...

1198
02:23:05,025 --> 02:23:07,118
...we're all very similar
from within.

1199
02:23:07,628 --> 02:23:09,357
What's the government's opinion
about the murder?

1200
02:23:09,430 --> 02:23:12,297
The murderer has surrendered himseif.

1201
02:23:12,800 --> 02:23:14,427
But who could be responbsible
behind this?

1202
02:23:14,501 --> 02:23:16,969
- Obviously, the foreign powers.
- which are those foreign powers?

1203
02:23:17,137 --> 02:23:19,628
Keep quiet. Or else,
they'll become cautious.

1204
02:23:19,807 --> 02:23:22,640
What was the purpose of the murderer
behind this killing?.

1205
02:23:22,810 --> 02:23:28,305
You ask me the purpose as if the
murderer is following me.

1206
02:23:38,325 --> 02:23:41,317
Move the convoy speedily.
I'm feeling suffocated in this city.

1207
02:23:52,840 --> 02:23:57,174
This is the departure list.
Ajay has escaped the country.

1208
02:23:59,013 --> 02:24:02,847
I haven't transferred myseif
out of fear for anybody.

1209
02:24:04,184 --> 02:24:05,845
In our country, many things take
place on paper...

1210
02:24:05,919 --> 02:24:07,910
..while in reality,
nothing happens.

1211
02:24:08,522 --> 02:24:11,355
I suppose he hasn't escaped
only on paper.

1212
02:24:12,860 --> 02:24:17,524
No, sir. He won't return now.

1213
02:25:00,407 --> 02:25:01,396
Let's return now.

1214
02:25:24,264 --> 02:25:26,596
He had not escaped.
He has died only now.

1215
02:25:28,102 --> 02:25:30,093
I'll cancel my transfer orders now.

1216
02:25:34,441 --> 02:25:35,430
Ajay! No!

1217
02:26:14,815 --> 02:26:16,476
The Commissioner is in the car.

1218
02:27:17,110 --> 02:27:21,376
You've done a good thing.

1219
02:30:49,923 --> 02:30:52,255
He disgraced me
in my own territory.

1220
02:30:52,926 --> 02:30:58,922
Cut him to pieces
and bring him to me.

1221
02:31:02,102 --> 02:31:06,766
Show this bastard
that my strength...

1222
02:31:07,274 --> 02:31:10,766
...shouldn't be underestimated.

1223
02:31:38,805 --> 02:31:40,796
Cut him to pieces.

1224
02:32:00,427 --> 02:32:03,828
Rverybody! Go inside!

1225
02:32:04,331 --> 02:32:09,325
And don't dare to come out!
This is my order!

1226
02:32:10,504 --> 02:32:16,170
Anybody who dares to come out
will have to be prepared to die.

1227
02:33:14,568 --> 02:33:15,899
What's this noise?

1228
02:33:17,237 --> 02:33:19,228
Why are they fighting?.

1229
02:33:21,241 --> 02:33:22,230
What kind of a war is it?

1230
02:33:23,743 --> 02:33:25,404
They are fighting!.

1231
02:33:30,917 --> 02:33:32,248
You disobeyed me?

1232
02:34:28,308 --> 02:34:30,640
Don't pour petrol on me!

1233
02:35:00,840 --> 02:35:02,000
Run!

1234
02:35:02,342 --> 02:35:06,335
If you mange a ride in the offin,
people'll consider you very fortunate.

1235
02:35:13,954 --> 02:35:19,187
Come out! And see Ikka's condition.

1236
02:35:19,859 --> 02:35:22,020
The man who made women
experience hell on earth.

1237
02:35:23,196 --> 02:35:25,187
Break your shackles
and come out.

1238
02:35:26,533 --> 02:35:28,524
You're no longer slaves of Ikka.

1239
02:35:29,703 --> 02:35:31,694
Come out of your captivity.

1240
02:35:32,539 --> 02:35:35,030
You're all free.

1241
02:35:39,546 --> 02:35:41,537
Let's go. Run!

1242
02:35:53,226 --> 02:35:54,215
Stop!

1243
02:35:56,062 --> 02:35:58,053
Stop!

1244
02:35:59,399 --> 02:36:04,735
Rvery woman on earth desires a home,
not a brothel.

1245
02:36:06,573 --> 02:36:10,566
Move forward, and burn down
these brothels yourselves.

1246
02:36:11,578 --> 02:36:14,741
Celebrate this freedom with fire.

1247
02:37:12,305 --> 02:37:15,138
Mother! Go ahead and burn down
this palace of cards!

1248
02:37:21,481 --> 02:37:23,972
No! No! No!

1249
02:37:36,229 --> 02:37:41,997
I'll see your face only when
you burn down Ikka's corpse.

1250
02:37:43,303 --> 02:37:47,831
Today, all us women liberate you
from your duty towards the woman...

1251
02:37:48,675 --> 02:37:50,666
...who must've given birth to you.

1252
02:38:36,055 --> 02:38:38,046
That's enough.

1253
02:38:38,291 --> 02:38:40,885
Stop this game of death,
or else...

1254
02:38:41,394 --> 02:38:44,227
No! I'll explain it to him.
He won't refuse me.

1255
02:38:49,569 --> 02:38:52,231
Stop this violence. Look!
Rven the police is here.

1256
02:38:53,072 --> 02:38:55,905
This violence will stop only
after I burn down Ikka's corpse.

1257
02:38:57,410 --> 02:38:59,401
You'd better go away from here.

1258
02:38:59,579 --> 02:39:02,241
Stop all this! Or I'll be
forced to open fire.

1259
02:39:04,083 --> 02:39:06,074
No! Don't fire!

1260
02:39:06,252 --> 02:39:09,244
If anything happens to Ajay,
I'll die too. Let me stop him.

1261
02:39:09,756 --> 02:39:12,589
For God's sake, please stop.

1262
02:39:15,595 --> 02:39:16,584
Please save me.

1263
02:40:28,835 --> 02:40:30,826
Such is our friendship!

1264
02:40:31,504 --> 02:40:33,495
You'll leave me midway?

1265
02:40:34,841 --> 02:40:39,505
Look! I was born at this very spot.

1266
02:40:41,848 --> 02:40:43,839
I'd to die here, after all.

1267
02:40:51,190 --> 02:40:53,181
I'll beat you if you weep.

1268
02:40:58,531 --> 02:41:00,522
You're not alone, my brother.

1269
02:41:02,535 --> 02:41:04,526
You've your mother.

1270
02:41:07,040 --> 02:41:09,031
You don't have only one mother.

1271
02:41:11,210 --> 02:41:13,201
Look at them attentively.

1272
02:41:15,548 --> 02:41:17,539
All the women here
are mothers.

1273
02:41:20,887 --> 02:41:22,878
All of them are Sandhya's.

1274
02:41:26,893 --> 02:41:28,884
Will you play a game for me?

1275
02:41:29,896 --> 02:41:31,887
What is remaining there to play?

1276
02:41:37,403 --> 02:41:39,394
One game is still pending.

1277
02:41:40,406 --> 02:41:42,397
You've a lot of wealth.

1278
02:41:44,911 --> 02:41:46,902
You've plenty of money.

1279
02:41:48,348 --> 02:41:50,339
Look...

1280
02:41:55,254 --> 02:41:58,746
All the brothels
have been burnt down.

1281
02:42:05,598 --> 02:42:07,589
At this spot,
you make such a place...

1282
02:42:10,436 --> 02:42:12,427
that a woman doesn't have to...

1283
02:42:14,040 --> 02:42:16,099
...dump her child in the gutter
the moment he's born.

1284
02:42:20,279 --> 02:42:22,270
A child should not tell
her mother here...

1285
02:42:24,784 --> 02:42:27,116
...that a customer has come.

1286
02:42:32,125 --> 02:42:34,457
Nobody should need to borrow
some name to call one's father.

1287
02:42:39,966 --> 02:42:41,957
No mother should be addressed
as a whore.

1288
02:42:46,806 --> 02:42:49,138
A Sandhya shouldn't be
molested any longer.

1289
02:42:53,646 --> 02:42:55,807
Promise me!

1290
02:42:58,651 --> 02:43:00,642
Promise me!

1291
02:43:01,320 --> 02:43:03,311
I promise you.

1292
02:43:06,826 --> 02:43:09,659
Mother! I'm feeling thirsty.

1293
02:43:14,500 --> 02:43:16,491
I'm feeling thirsty.

1294
02:43:18,838 --> 02:43:20,499
I'm feeling thirsty.

1295
02:43:38,357 --> 02:43:41,520
You deserve this holy Ganges water
not due to your birth...

1296
02:43:42,361 --> 02:43:44,352
..but due to your deeds.

1297
02:43:54,707 --> 02:43:56,698
Mother!

1298
02:43:58,878 --> 02:44:03,542
I'm going into
a deep sleep in your lap.

1299
02:44:08,054 --> 02:44:10,045
Don't wake me!

1300
02:45:29,468 --> 02:45:32,801
My son was a brave man.
He fought for a cause.

1301
02:45:33,306 --> 02:45:36,469
And once he achieved his aim,
he made a heroic departure.
