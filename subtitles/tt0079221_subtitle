177
00:12:39,962 --> 00:12:41,547
Tell me what will the result be

178
00:12:41,922 --> 00:12:43,716
I can't tell the result of the hockey test

179
00:12:44,425 --> 00:12:46,385
But I can surely tell the results of your interview

180
00:12:46,385 --> 00:12:46,969
what?

181
00:12:47,136 --> 00:12:49,597
If you wear these clothes to the interview

182
00:12:49,597 --> 00:12:51,182
the result will be 'whoosh'

183
00:12:52,099 --> 00:12:52,767
I don't understand

184
00:12:53,267 --> 00:12:54,268
I've come here to make you understand

185
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,685
Ratna child, first make me tea. Go

186
00:12:55,727 --> 00:12:56,394
Come here

187
00:12:58,104 --> 00:12:58,855
come sit

188
00:13:00,148 --> 00:13:02,650
Let me tell you something about Bhavani Shankar

189
00:13:02,942 --> 00:13:03,610
Bhavani Shankar?

190
00:13:04,068 --> 00:13:07,363
Yes! the proprieter of Urmilla Traders
who will be interviewing you today

191
00:13:07,614 --> 00:13:08,656
my childhood friend

192
00:13:09,282 --> 00:13:09,783
-I see

193
00:13:09,908 --> 00:13:12,035
He is a character with very strong
likes and dislikes

194
00:13:13,036 --> 00:13:15,413
For him, your biggest plus point is
your moustache

195
00:13:15,413 --> 00:13:16,456
-Huh?
-Yes

196
00:13:16,831 --> 00:13:18,958
He measures people by their moustache

197
00:13:19,334 --> 00:13:20,126
he says

198
00:13:21,085 --> 00:13:22,462
He whose moustache is clean

199
00:13:22,962 --> 00:13:24,464
his heart isn't clean

200
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:26,215
This he says truly

201
00:13:26,423 --> 00:13:27,090
-yes?
-Yes!

202
00:13:28,675 --> 00:13:29,593
No no. I didn't mean you

203
00:13:29,885 --> 00:13:30,886
You are an exception uncle

204
00:13:32,096 --> 00:13:34,098
So in his office there will only be
people with moustache?

205
00:13:34,932 --> 00:13:36,225
Yes. apart from the receptionist

206
00:13:36,642 --> 00:13:38,894
-because..its a girl

207
00:13:39,645 --> 00:13:40,312
Now listen carefully

208
00:13:40,979 --> 00:13:41,814
Number one, this

209
00:13:42,439 --> 00:13:44,358
- Don't use your short name in the interview

210
00:13:44,775 --> 00:13:45,984
you have to use your full name

211
00:13:46,443 --> 00:13:47,486
R.p. Sharma wont do

212
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:50,155
You have to say "Ram prasad Sharma"

213
00:13:50,739 --> 00:13:51,657
Number two, this

214
00:13:52,282 --> 00:13:54,200
He hates recommendations

215
00:13:54,659 --> 00:13:56,828
he shouldn't know that I am related to you

216
00:13:58,162 --> 00:14:00,331
And number three. most important point

217
00:14:00,748 --> 00:14:03,000
Don't answer any questions other than 'on' accountancy

218
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:03,334
huh?

219
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:07,255
Assume you don't know anything about
Cinema, hockey, cricket, football and music

220
00:14:07,547 --> 00:14:08,631
- A total peasant

221
00:14:10,007 --> 00:14:10,091
peasant?

222
00:14:10,633 --> 00:14:13,386
-Because, Bhavani Shankar's father used to tell him

223
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:16,556
"During the years of study, there should only be study

224
00:14:16,973 --> 00:14:17,473
And nothing else

225
00:14:18,433 --> 00:14:19,892
After studies are over

226
00:14:20,268 --> 00:14:21,602
Fulfill all you desire"

227
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,647
He is very proud of his culture and heritage

228
00:14:25,981 --> 00:14:27,607
So instead of shirt and pant

229
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,694
wear "dhoti kurta" or"kurta pyjama"

230
00:14:31,611 --> 00:14:34,197
But Uncle. I don't even have a "Kurta pyjama"

231
00:14:34,614 --> 00:14:35,407
Then Beg, Borrow or Steal

232
00:14:35,949 --> 00:14:37,075
manage it from somewhere

233
00:14:37,951 --> 00:14:38,410
- And listen

234
00:14:39,035 --> 00:14:41,371
Apply oil on your head nicely

235
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:45,125
Uncle

236
00:14:46,793 --> 00:14:49,463
Which insolent says that "Hitler is dead"?

237
00:14:57,178 --> 00:14:58,512
Wait, wait, wait. Stop the Car

238
00:15:01,307 --> 00:15:01,932
prasad!

239
00:15:03,267 --> 00:15:04,101
Dever?

240
00:15:04,602 --> 00:15:06,979
Where have you been in over a year?

241
00:15:06,896 --> 00:15:08,022
And where are you going?

242
00:15:08,856 --> 00:15:10,191
-Do you remember Jagganath?
-Yes

243
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:11,776
- He is a social worker now
- I see

244
00:15:11,901 --> 00:15:14,862
I'm going to borrow a "Kurta pyjama"
from him for just a day

245
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:16,322
I have an interview

246
00:15:16,822 --> 00:15:19,158
"Kurta pyjama" for an interview!
-Yes

247
00:15:18,824 --> 00:15:21,118
Did you apply for some ministership?

248
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,787
See. Don't get involved in ministership

249
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:26,539
- find some permanent job
-No. Its not that

250
00:15:26,372 --> 00:15:28,458
You want a "Kurta pyjama"? -Yes
-then come with me

251
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:30,126
I'm going to mohan studios.
I will get one for you

252
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,088
Camera Running. B/12 Take 1

253
00:15:34,422 --> 00:15:35,173
Amit

254
00:15:38,676 --> 00:15:39,969
your drink. Lady

255
00:15:58,278 --> 00:15:59,530
mr ButteroChips

256
00:16:00,948 --> 00:16:04,284
The way to offer drinks to ladies is this

257
00:16:05,619 --> 00:16:09,456
come Hurricane, come typhoon, come eartquake

258
00:16:09,873 --> 00:16:10,332
But..

259
00:16:10,874 --> 00:16:14,002
Not a drop of wine is spilt from the glass

260
00:16:14,461 --> 00:16:15,462
And even if it spills

261
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:18,257
It spills with style

262
00:16:18,715 --> 00:16:20,050
Like this

263
00:16:21,468 --> 00:16:22,510
Cut it!

264
00:16:28,683 --> 00:16:30,226

00:16:51,538 --> 00:16:54,791
I'm working in a mythological mystery, suspense drama

00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,669
"Who is parvati's Husband?"

273
00:16:58,378 --> 00:17:00,088
O! I forgot to introduce you.

274
00:16:59,713 --> 00:17:02,549
This is my childhood friend, mr. prasad

275
00:17:03,258 --> 00:17:05,051
And..I don't need to say anything about him

276
00:17:05,135 --> 00:17:06,136
There is blood flowing from there

277
00:17:06,762 --> 00:17:07,971
-Yes. Its makeup
-Oh!

278
00:17:08,346 --> 00:17:10,348

00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:39,960

OK.please write
"To Rita, from bro. Anthony Bachhan"

285
00:17:54,766 --> 00:17:58,770
Friend. With this moustache you look very different

286
00:17:59,395 --> 00:18:03,108
Yes friend. I have to do a double role for twins

287
00:18:03,691 --> 00:18:05,652
One has moustache, other doesn't

288
00:18:06,444 --> 00:18:09,114
Shamnadar, this side is a bit higher

289
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,407
- please trim this a bit

290
00:18:11,908 --> 00:18:13,284
-Ok

291
00:18:13,576 --> 00:18:15,203
-No
-Then why are you putting me a moustache?

292
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:17,580
Just get me ready. Go and send Bhosle

293
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,418
Tell me something

00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,087
- How is Ratna?
-She's fine. Doing her m.A.

295
00:18:25,379 --> 00:18:28,090
She's doing m.A.!..and did you marry?

296
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:30,342
-no
-and any affairs?

297
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:31,009
No

298
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:34,012
-Eh! just like this! straight and simple?

299
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:36,306
See. what I am telling you is..

300
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:37,141
-Deven Sir?

301
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:38,892
Here are the "Kurta pyjamas"

302
00:18:39,143 --> 00:18:41,687
-Bro. check which one you like
-Any simple one will do

303
00:18:42,146 --> 00:18:43,397
Atleast make a selection!

304
00:18:44,815 --> 00:18:45,732
This will be fine

305
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:51,571
-Friend. This one..
- this looks like Amitabh Bachhan's. Leave it.

306
00:18:51,571 --> 00:18:52,989
select another one

307
00:18:54,407 --> 00:18:56,075
This will do

308
00:18:58,995 --> 00:19:01,164
- this is too broad. Whose is this?
-this belongs to bro. Hari

309
00:19:02,248 --> 00:19:03,624
Oh! Sanjeev Kumar's

310
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:07,003
Don't you have any Kurta of his size?

311
00:19:07,044 --> 00:19:10,465
I have sir Asrani's Kurta but it
maybe a bit smaller for him

312
00:19:10,673 --> 00:19:14,093
No no. It will do. Its just for one day
I will manage. please bring it.

313
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:18,389
And also bring a sling bag
and a jacket along

314
00:19:18,514 --> 00:19:19,598
But why do we need that?

315
00:19:20,348 --> 00:19:24,770
Oh! Kid! If you wear only Kurta pyjama
you will look like mr. Gulzar

316
00:19:25,395 --> 00:19:30,358
wear a Dhoti, Kurta and jacket
and you will look like mr. India

317
00:19:31,568 --> 00:19:33,278
mr. India!

318
00:19:41,828 --> 00:19:43,622
-Badri Narayan Srivastav?
-Ya!

319
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:50,669
What's the matter?
12 interviews over in 20 mins?

320
00:19:51,003 --> 00:19:53,380
I can't understand anything.
Nothing was asked on Accountancy

321
00:19:54,173 --> 00:19:56,133
- He asks all kinds of weird questions
- weird questions? meaning?

322
00:19:56,634 --> 00:19:59,929
Brother, all this is a show.
The selection has already been made

335
00:20:40,844 --> 00:20:43,263

I think I got the job. Ciao

351
00:21:46,531 --> 00:21:49,493
-hmm. what is your given name?
-Venkateshwar Ayengar sir

352
00:21:51,244 --> 00:21:54,664
I have heard that in the south,
the father's name is suffixed to the name

353
00:21:54,915 --> 00:21:57,292
Not only father's name, sir,
the village name is also suffixed

354
00:21:57,292 --> 00:22:02,005
Actually my name is Venkateshan Krishnamurty
Chirampapalli Ayengar, sir

355
00:22:02,297 --> 00:22:03,298
Hmm..

356
00:22:03,924 --> 00:22:08,804
So, what is your opinion about "Black pearl"
mr. Venkateshan .. Rammurty...

357
00:22:09,054 --> 00:22:10,722
Not Rammurty sir, Krishnamurty

358
00:22:11,264 --> 00:22:12,599
Yes, yes

359
00:22:13,475 --> 00:22:16,811
So, what is your opinion about the
famous footballer "Black pearl"

360
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:19,480
Sir, I have no interest in football

361
00:22:20,147 --> 00:22:24,068
-then lets talk about cricket
-actually, I don't have interest in sports

362
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:26,195
that's good, very good.

363
00:22:26,195 --> 00:22:29,532
But you can ask me anything
about dance and music, sir

364
00:22:29,907 --> 00:22:33,035
-about "Bharatnatyam"
-meaning, you dance?

365
00:22:33,828 --> 00:22:35,830
No sir, I don't dance, my sister dances

366
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:40,543
Last week she had a programme on TV
people say she dances like "Hema malini"

367
00:22:41,544 --> 00:22:44,380
As a matter of fact sir,
Hema malini is also of my caste

368
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:45,713
She's also an Ayengar

369
00:22:46,464 --> 00:22:50,301
Sir, I have learnt Karnatak music.
I can sing very well sir

370
00:22:51,177 --> 00:22:53,680
God willing, I will listen to it someday
Now you can go

371
00:22:54,264 --> 00:22:55,473
-Good day
-Good day

372
00:23:00,562 --> 00:23:00,937
Next

373
00:23:02,564 --> 00:23:07,485
Head Clerk! please bring the experienced candidates file
Looks like we have to get someone from there

374
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:10,655
I am very disappointed with
this new generation, head clerk

375
00:23:11,364 --> 00:23:12,907
Half of them don't have moustaches

376
00:23:12,907 --> 00:23:17,286
of other half, their dress and speech
rushes blood to my head

377
00:23:17,745 --> 00:23:21,540
Nothing can be done for this country
This country has no future

378
00:23:22,499 --> 00:23:26,128
Now, there is just one remaining.
I will have a look at him too

379
00:23:26,128 --> 00:23:28,255
please bring out the file of the experienced people

380
00:23:29,882 --> 00:23:30,716
Good day sir

381
00:23:34,386 --> 00:23:34,845
Good day

382
00:23:35,971 --> 00:23:37,181
please come

383
00:23:40,059 --> 00:23:43,771
-So, your good name is?
-Ram prasad Dussherat prasad Sharma

384
00:23:44,103 --> 00:23:46,481
Yes..Sit, sit

385
00:23:46,981 --> 00:23:47,982
Thank you sir

386
00:23:49,525 --> 00:23:51,527
What is your opinion on Sunil Gavaskar?

387
00:23:52,987 --> 00:23:57,575
- Sunil....Gavaskar....?
-Yes, yes, famous cricketer

388
00:23:58,701 --> 00:24:02,872
pardon me Sir. my knowledge on
cricket is very limited

389
00:24:03,498 --> 00:24:08,127
-Its alright, its alright. Doesn't matter.
Tell me something about Black pearl.

390
00:24:10,254 --> 00:24:13,091
I didn't know that pearls are also black in colour

391
00:24:13,466 --> 00:24:16,927
I used to think that pearls are only white in colour

392
00:24:16,718 --> 00:24:19,179
I am talking about "pele"

393
00:24:19,513 --> 00:24:22,974
O! he is a great man, sir. Very great.

394
00:24:23,558 --> 00:24:26,353
- I see
-then tell me something about his greatness

395
00:24:26,853 --> 00:24:31,566
His thesis on the "per Capita income of the
backward tribes of maharastra" is worth reading sir

396
00:24:31,733 --> 00:24:32,901
Whom are you talking about?

397
00:24:33,485 --> 00:24:36,279
Rayleigh sir. prof. Rayleigh, renowned economist

398
00:24:36,405 --> 00:24:41,701
No! no. I am talking about "pele" p.E.L.E. pele!
the famous football player

399
00:24:41,993 --> 00:24:46,664
Oh! Yes. I did read in the newspaper a few days earlier

400
00:24:46,664 --> 00:24:52,503
that 20-30 thousand mad people went to Calcutta's
Dumdum airport at midnight to receive him...and...

401
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:59,719
thats all I know about him, sir.

402
00:25:00,177 --> 00:25:04,849
Ok. What is your opinion on the forthcoming
hockey test between India and pakistan?

403
00:25:06,726 --> 00:25:09,395
-Allow me sir
- Why? why? What happened?

404
00:25:11,021 --> 00:25:15,024
Apart from my field,
I have no knowledge in other fields, sir

405
00:25:15,734 --> 00:25:18,778
my father taught us that
"Youth is for work"

406
00:25:19,529 --> 00:25:22,073
to fulfill your desire, you have your entire life

407
00:25:22,574 --> 00:25:27,662
But today I realised that it is necessary
to have knoweldge about sports etc etc.

408
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:31,791
-Father's teachings were untrue
-Absolutely not! Absolutely not!

409
00:25:32,167 --> 00:25:33,960
Whatever your father taught was right

410
00:25:34,419 --> 00:25:37,130
Sit, sit...And what else did he teach?

411
00:25:37,881 --> 00:25:39,466
He used to say that "Never let your values....."

412
00:25:41,801 --> 00:25:44,762
Let it go, sir.
You might think him to be crazy

413
00:25:44,762 --> 00:25:45,929
No! Say

414
00:25:47,931 --> 00:25:52,186
He used to say, humans should give due respect
to their values and moustaches

415
00:25:52,644 --> 00:25:55,397
"moustache is the mirror of the
human soul and mind"

416
00:25:55,898 --> 00:25:59,401
- "moustache is the mirror of heart"
- "a saying worth a million"

417
00:26:00,611 --> 00:26:04,782
Son, I say, "One without a moustache
is one without a heart"

418
00:26:05,699 --> 00:26:07,910
You have really got a valued education

419
00:26:08,368 --> 00:26:11,662
Can you ...see..this balance sheet?

420
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:20,671
-This is 197..
- Shhh...

421
00:26:24,759 --> 00:26:28,262
Which novice has made this sir?
This man is a complete duffer

422
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:30,223
I have made this

423
00:26:31,182 --> 00:26:35,019
I ask for forgiveness, sir.
But ..But this is wrong

424
00:26:35,186 --> 00:26:36,938
I know that

425
00:26:37,146 --> 00:26:39,357
I just wanted to see how much you knew

426
00:26:40,982 --> 00:26:44,069
I am very happy with you
I am very proud of you , my boy

427
00:26:44,653 --> 00:26:47,364
Listen, come to work from tomorrow

428
00:26:48,115 --> 00:26:50,867
I'll start your salary from Rs 800

429
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:54,246
- 800?
-Ok 850. But not a single penny more.

430
00:26:54,538 --> 00:26:58,542
-you youngsters only want money...
-No sir, that's not what I meant

431
00:26:58,792 --> 00:27:02,003
I am a fresher, sir. How can I get 850?

432
00:27:02,045 --> 00:27:04,673
I don't deserve even Rs. 550

433
00:27:05,549 --> 00:27:11,470
Look son. Don't tell me what you deserve.
Understand? Now go. Come tomorrow.

434
00:27:13,681 --> 00:27:14,390
Listen

435
00:27:19,645 --> 00:27:21,313
Why do you wear such a short Kurta?

436
00:27:22,481 --> 00:27:28,571
Sir, my father used to say that a Kurta
is for covering the outwardly shame of the body

437
00:27:28,571 --> 00:27:33,826
In India there are 30 million men,
of which 10 million wear kurta

438
00:27:33,826 --> 00:27:37,496
If every man reduces the length
of his Kurta even by 6 inches

439
00:27:37,496 --> 00:27:39,248
then with the cloth saved from that

440
00:27:39,248 --> 00:27:42,876
how many persons clothing problem can be solved!

441
00:27:43,334 --> 00:27:47,922
that's why my father used to say that wearing
long clothes is a very harmful fashion

442
00:27:47,922 --> 00:27:51,051
-that's why he was against fashion
-was? meaning...he...

443
00:27:51,051 --> 00:27:54,387
Yes sir. 4 years ago,
he left for his heavenly abode

444
00:27:56,056 --> 00:28:02,479
Its such a pity that I didn't have the fortune
to meet such a great and straight thinker

445
00:28:02,687 --> 00:28:04,898
But he is always with me, sir.

446
00:28:05,273 --> 00:28:08,068
His memories remind me every moment that

447
00:28:08,068 --> 00:28:13,822
even after death, one can remain immortal
through one's thoughts and principles

448
00:28:17,493 --> 00:28:17,534
you will go far

449
00:28:17,826 --> 00:28:19,411
But, I have a small request

450
00:28:20,037 --> 00:28:23,874
use such big, heavy words
in writing, not in speaking

451
00:28:23,874 --> 00:28:26,752
- its difficult to understand
-ok, sir

452
00:28:29,713 --> 00:28:31,548
-my respects, sir
-long live my son

453
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,264
come, head clerk

454
00:28:42,225 --> 00:28:42,850
please sit

455
00:28:44,644 --> 00:28:46,396
Have you ever seen a real diamond?

456
00:28:47,939 --> 00:28:54,070
Yes sir, once I had gone to the lecture of Savitri devi,
I saw it in her necklace

457
00:28:55,071 --> 00:28:57,532
that's not a real diamond

458
00:28:57,990 --> 00:29:00,368
-Did you see a guy leave now?
-Yes

459
00:29:00,368 --> 00:29:02,662
-Ah! this is a real diamond

460
00:29:03,246 --> 00:29:04,747
-yes
-Brilliant!

461
00:29:04,914 --> 00:29:08,209
Bravo! Bravo! my boy
I was getting worried over nothing

462
00:29:08,209 --> 00:29:13,839
Even if you weren't a Chartered account
you would have earned well in a Drama company

463
00:29:14,339 --> 00:29:20,345
that is alright uncle but this mini Kurta
How will this mini Kurta work?

464
00:29:20,345 --> 00:29:22,764
This belongs to someone else
make one of your own size

465
00:29:22,931 --> 00:29:24,808
O! no. there lies the dilema

466
00:29:25,392 --> 00:29:29,688
people hit their feet with an axe,
I have hit the axe with my feet

467
00:29:29,688 --> 00:29:30,480
How is that?

468
00:29:31,148 --> 00:29:37,446
To impress , I had argued that our father
used to say "we should only wear short Kurtas"

469
00:29:38,154 --> 00:29:40,823
How can I break my father's command?

470
00:29:41,282 --> 00:29:44,660
-Yes, the Kurta is a little smaller
- little?

471
00:29:44,994 --> 00:29:49,540
Son. Instead of 550 you'll get a salary of 850

472
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:55,129
what about a small kurta? Even if you have to
wear a vest to work you shouldn't complain

473
00:29:56,088 --> 00:29:59,091
Ratna, I have to discuss some important
things with him, you go there

474
00:30:04,055 --> 00:30:05,514
Understand one thing son

475
00:30:07,141 --> 00:30:10,602
If you can keep Bhavani Shankar happy,
you can get many things

476
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:15,231
Do you know who is the "Urmilla" of "Urmilla Traders"?

477
00:30:16,524 --> 00:30:18,860
Bhavani Shankar's only daughter

478
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:24,532
-So?
- She is beautiful and unmarried too

479
00:30:25,075 --> 00:30:28,787
In order to build a relation with you,
I broke my relations with the world

480
00:30:29,829 --> 00:30:32,499
speak. why are you silent? please speak

481
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:38,545
Isn't it my only fault is that
I married you in secrecy from all?

482
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:41,173
what if you didn't come with the bridal party?

483
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:44,093
Oboes weren't played, songs weren't sung

484
00:30:44,093 --> 00:30:49,640
But with God as witness,
didn't you accepted me as your wife?

485
00:30:51,308 --> 00:30:53,727
Don't forsake me

486
00:30:53,727 --> 00:30:57,564
I..I'm going to be the mother of your child

487
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:05,572
O! Lord, open the eyes of my heart, O! Lord

488
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:08,616
-First open the eyes on your head!

489
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:13,621
But do you listen? Either you're busy in your work
or you're busy slimming your potbelly

490
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:17,500
I have said so many times
Don't give so much freedom to your daughter

491
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,835
What happened today?

492
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:22,130
A terrible thing has happened brother.
Urmi has married secretly

493
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:25,258
Who told you?

494
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:27,260
I heard it with my own ear

495
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,512
And the guy is fleeing from her

496
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:34,308
And not only that brother. Urmi.....
what happened?

497
00:31:34,308 --> 00:31:38,520
-say what happened!
-Urmi is going to become the mother of his child

498
00:31:40,522 --> 00:31:43,567
- Where is Urmi? Urmi, where?
- In her room

499
00:31:46,361 --> 00:31:48,447
I married you secretly from my father

500
00:31:48,447 --> 00:31:51,658
this is my fault. say it! Why are you silent?

501
00:31:52,075 --> 00:31:54,536
Say it. Say it. Why are you silent?

502
00:31:55,162 --> 00:31:58,498
If you forsake me in this condition,
then I will have only one way

503
00:31:58,498 --> 00:31:59,916
to commit suicide

504
00:32:02,836 --> 00:32:06,005
Urmi. Urmi! Open the door

505
00:32:07,214 --> 00:32:08,340
Open the door Urmi.

506
00:32:11,844 --> 00:32:14,096
- What happened daddy?
- Hasn't happened. Will happen

507
00:32:14,346 --> 00:32:15,264
What will happen?

508
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,768
What happened aunty?

509
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:22,229
What have you done daughter! What have you done!

510
00:32:22,229 --> 00:32:22,938
What did I do?

511
00:32:23,522 --> 00:32:24,690
"What have I done"?

512
00:32:25,441 --> 00:32:27,943
You have shamed the entire dynasty
and you ask "what have I done"?

513
00:32:28,444 --> 00:32:30,905
Where is the rascal? Today I will shoot him!

514
00:32:30,905 --> 00:32:34,075
-If you wanted to marry then....
-Stop it. Stop it daddy. This is the limit

515
00:32:35,325 --> 00:32:39,287
Look! this is the bottle of glycerine
and this is the play book

516
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:44,167
And see this...there will be a play in my college
and I was rehearsing for it

517
00:32:46,461 --> 00:32:47,295
See this!

518
00:32:48,588 --> 00:32:52,300
Rehearsal?
Why do you need vermillion in rehearsal?

519
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:56,679
Amazing daddy! The role is of a married woman.
If I don't put on vermillion, how will the feelings come?

520
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,852
Daddy? It was no fun alone. please sit.
I will do infront of you. Come.

521
00:33:03,478 --> 00:33:04,354
-huh?
-please sit

522
00:33:05,896 --> 00:33:07,189
You come too, aunty

523
00:33:09,608 --> 00:33:11,318
I'll do. ok?

524
00:33:14,863 --> 00:33:18,117
Imagine. Imagine that aunty is mahender

525
00:33:18,492 --> 00:33:19,410
mahender, who?

526
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:21,328
mahender! with whom I've married secretly

527
00:33:21,328 --> 00:33:22,454
- Oh. Aye! Beware!

528
00:33:23,288 --> 00:33:27,835
Daddy! I'm acting daddy.
Its a play. please listen

529
00:33:34,882 --> 00:33:36,384
I am in love with you, mahender

530
00:33:37,593 --> 00:33:40,096
Daughter, you shouldn't speak your husband's name

531
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:43,015
Say like this "O! can you hear?"

532
00:33:43,266 --> 00:33:46,936
O my god! Aunty!
This is a modern play

533
00:33:46,978 --> 00:33:48,980
But why do you need to do
such an unsavoury plays?

534
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:54,569
Why can't you do plays  like "Hail Goddess Santoshi",
"Devotee pralad". Right brother?

535
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:55,236
- without doubt

536
00:33:55,236 --> 00:33:57,488
you people want to hear or not?
you want to hear, right?

537
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:58,489
-speak

538
00:33:58,489 --> 00:33:59,032
then listen

539
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:11,460
mahender, I love you
and..and your child is in my stomach

540
00:34:21,970 --> 00:34:23,930
-Good morning, sir
-Good morning

541
00:34:24,306 --> 00:34:25,057
Greetings head clerk

542
00:34:26,224 --> 00:34:29,978
What's the matter Ramprasad? It's not yet 9:30
and you've started work already!

543
00:34:29,978 --> 00:34:31,855
-Sir, I arrived at 8
-why?

544
00:34:32,272 --> 00:34:35,358
Yesterday the boss asked to
prepare the file for "Ahuja & Ahuja"

545
00:34:35,941 --> 00:34:41,072
what was the hurry? you had the entire day
the file was needed in the evening

546
00:34:41,822 --> 00:34:43,199
No, head clerk

547
00:34:43,491 --> 00:34:48,079
my father used to say
"Do tomorrow's work today and today's work now"

548
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:54,335
On what you said
A new poet of the new generation has said

549
00:34:55,419 --> 00:34:59,215
"Do today's work today and
tomorrow's work the day after"

550
00:34:59,215 --> 00:35:04,219
"what's the hurry son, when you have years to live?"

551
00:35:04,636 --> 00:35:06,179
bravo, bravo, bravo

552
00:35:06,554 --> 00:35:10,725
But you didn't ask who wrote this limerick

553
00:35:10,892 --> 00:35:12,769
-who has written it?
-this nameless has

554
00:35:13,186 --> 00:35:16,314
-Head clerk. You turned out to be a genius!
-Good morning Sir

555
00:35:17,857 --> 00:35:19,442
-Good morning Sir
-Good morning

556
00:35:19,984 --> 00:35:21,361
-Greetings sir
-Greetings

557
00:35:30,286 --> 00:35:32,079
-Take this sir
-what's this?

558
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:33,706
-the file of "Ahuja & Ahuja" company

559
00:35:34,206 --> 00:35:37,793
When did you finish it?
I told you only at 5pm yesterday

560
00:35:37,793 --> 00:35:43,215
why sir? Yesterday I was here till 7
and today I came at 8 and completed it

561
00:35:44,466 --> 00:35:47,136
But what was the need to do overtime
I don't pay overtime to anyone

562
00:35:48,637 --> 00:35:53,434
Sir, my father used to say
"If you have to work don't look at the face of time"

563
00:35:54,935 --> 00:35:56,854
And do you know what my father used to say?

564
00:35:58,063 --> 00:36:04,652
He used to say, "Bhavani, put your heart in that
youngster who puts his heart into work"

565
00:36:07,447 --> 00:36:09,907
-there is a small matter sir
-what?

566
00:36:09,907 --> 00:36:14,078
-Our company takes short term loans from Ahuja & Ahuja
-that's right

567
00:36:14,078 --> 00:36:16,080
-But sir, they deduct the interest prior to giving the load

568
00:36:16,664 --> 00:36:17,248
-what happened?

569
00:36:18,416 --> 00:36:19,292
see this

570
00:36:20,668 --> 00:36:23,004
we borrowed 25,000 at a monthly interest of 1.5%

571
00:36:23,004 --> 00:36:28,468
but we got 22,750, meaning we gave
an interest of 2,250 on 22,750

572
00:36:28,468 --> 00:36:32,429
which means the rate of interest became
2.29% instead of 1.5%, sir

573
00:36:34,097 --> 00:36:38,143
In the last 5 years we have taken
a loan of 500,000 from them and..

574
00:36:38,769 --> 00:36:40,604
we've got 15,000 less

575
00:36:40,604 --> 00:36:41,188
You are right!

576
00:36:43,857 --> 00:36:46,026
my God! No one thought about this

577
00:36:46,777 --> 00:36:49,738
In my opinion we should send this
file to our legal advisor

578
00:36:49,738 --> 00:36:53,825
- write a letter to the company asking for an explanation
-ok sir

579
00:37:01,082 --> 00:37:02,458
-Head clerk?
-Yes sir

580
00:37:02,458 --> 00:37:07,922
from this month onwards give Ramprasad
Rs. 100 for conveyance allowance. Alright?

581
00:37:18,891 --> 00:37:22,436
-One day I saw a dream in a dream
-what?

582
00:37:28,442 --> 00:37:28,484
-you know our Amitabh?
-Bachhan?

583
00:37:28,484 --> 00:37:32,821
He was out of the market
people had a doubt

584
00:37:33,363 --> 00:37:37,409
Due to me he was gone, gone,gone,gone,gone!

585
00:37:38,076 --> 00:37:42,372
my luck changed
what can I say "Really"!

586
00:37:42,372 --> 00:37:44,874
I became Amitabh

587
00:37:48,128 --> 00:37:50,672
I saw a dream in a dream

588
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:08,856
-On the right Hema
-malini?

589
00:38:08,856 --> 00:38:11,275
-On the left Zeenat
-Amaan?

590
00:38:11,275 --> 00:38:15,112
In the front Rekha
and what I saw behind

591
00:38:16,655 --> 00:38:17,906
On the right Hema

592
00:38:18,782 --> 00:38:20,492
On the left Zeenat

593
00:38:21,035 --> 00:38:24,163
On the front Rekha and what I saw behind

594
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:25,414
-So what happened?

595
00:38:26,498 --> 00:38:30,043
Ratna was standing with a cane in her hand

596
00:38:30,043 --> 00:38:34,589
In no time, I was running

597
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:37,550
I saw I was awake

598
00:38:39,761 --> 00:38:42,722
I saw a dream in a dream

599
00:38:55,902 --> 00:38:57,195
-Yes! I remembered one more
-Tell us

600
00:38:59,029 --> 00:39:03,158
-One day I saw a small dream
-dream?

601
00:39:03,825 --> 00:39:08,455
You know our Lata?

602
00:39:08,455 --> 00:39:12,959
Lata was music
I was on the Tabla

603
00:39:12,959 --> 00:39:17,631
She was in the beginning
I was at the end

604
00:39:33,396 --> 00:39:42,321
I saw a dream in a dream

605
00:39:46,033 --> 00:39:49,120
-please have these
-Wow! this is great

606
00:39:49,578 --> 00:39:51,038
Brother, a sister should be like this

607
00:39:51,455 --> 00:39:55,459
-O idiots, this isn't samosas
-then what is it?

608
00:39:55,626 --> 00:39:59,045
This is a sisters.......love

609
00:39:59,587 --> 00:40:01,881
Eat quickly or the love will grow cold

610
00:40:02,382 --> 00:40:03,258
Here, eat, eat.

611
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:06,761
-Hey friend prasad, when will you get a raise again?

612
00:40:08,263 --> 00:40:09,973
Attention! Attention!

613
00:40:12,267 --> 00:40:16,146
Friends..Romans..and Countrymen

614
00:40:17,564 --> 00:40:19,190
Lend me your ears

615
00:40:20,233 --> 00:40:24,529
prasad's promotion's celebration will be from me

616
00:40:28,574 --> 00:40:32,161
But in this celebration,
apart from me and prasad

617
00:40:32,161 --> 00:40:34,079
Only one more person can join

618
00:40:34,496 --> 00:40:35,664
friend, this is against Democracy!

619
00:40:35,998 --> 00:40:38,083
-down with personality curse!
-Yes!Yes!

620
00:40:38,208 --> 00:40:39,418
Silence, silence

621
00:40:41,337 --> 00:40:44,882
protesting doesn't mean that you can
do whatever you like and make noise

622
00:40:46,425 --> 00:40:51,055
Friends, the fact is that I have only
3 tickets for tomorrow's hockey test match

623
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,223
13 people can't go on 3 person's ticket

624
00:40:54,683 --> 00:40:56,934
This is the time to sacrifice for friends

625
00:40:56,934 --> 00:40:59,270
Those who don't want to go,
please raise your hands

626
00:41:04,233 --> 00:41:07,820
What? Hockey test match and you won't go?

627
00:41:09,781 --> 00:41:10,782
I didn't get leave

628
00:41:10,782 --> 00:41:11,949
Take half day off

629
00:41:12,533 --> 00:41:14,243
-I won't get leave for a test match
-why?

630
00:41:15,161 --> 00:41:17,497
That's a different drama, friend
I'll tell you some other time

631
00:41:18,164 --> 00:41:20,249
Ok, you are an expert in acting

632
00:41:20,249 --> 00:41:21,250
Just say

633
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:24,128
Say that your mother suddenly became ill

634
00:41:24,629 --> 00:41:27,089
shame, shame, why are you
dragging in a dead mother?

635
00:41:27,589 --> 00:41:28,757
-So, what happened?

636
00:41:29,007 --> 00:41:32,552
By saying that his mother is ill,
he is just making his dead mother alive

637
00:41:33,053 --> 00:41:36,264
Yes friend, he is correct
there is nothing to shame in this

638
00:41:36,973 --> 00:41:37,974
brother, I will surely go

639
00:41:38,767 --> 00:41:42,396
I will call you exactly at 3 saying
your mother suddenly became ill

640
00:41:42,938 --> 00:41:44,064
Yes, that will be alright

641
00:41:44,981 --> 00:41:46,525
I'll give you the phone number of my boss' cabin

642
00:41:46,525 --> 00:41:50,070
If the boss himself receives the call
there won't be any reason to suspect

643
00:41:50,779 --> 00:41:53,198
And yes, bring along a shirt and pant for me

644
00:41:53,198 --> 00:41:55,992
I'll come to your house and we can go
straight to the stadium from there

645
00:41:56,283 --> 00:41:58,536
Friend, why is the need to bring a shirt and a pant?

646
00:42:01,414 --> 00:42:06,293
Friend, if I go to see the test match
wearing the clothes I wear to work,

647
00:42:06,293 --> 00:42:07,962
India will surely lose

648
00:42:10,131 --> 00:42:15,469
remember boss' number 449002.
Call exactly at 3. Ok?

649
00:42:25,562 --> 00:42:26,688
Dispatch this today itself

650
00:42:27,564 --> 00:42:29,399
-Sir, you've initialled the duplicate?
-yes

651
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,945
I have to go now for work. You wait here.

652
00:42:33,945 --> 00:42:37,032
mr. Khanna's call will come at 5'o clock
very important call

653
00:42:37,365 --> 00:42:38,366

654

657

Good Lord!

658
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:57,301
Yes I'll send right now

659
00:42:58,886 --> 00:43:02,348
-It was one of your neighbour's call
-I'm sorry sir, I'll forbid them

660
00:43:02,514 --> 00:43:05,893
No, no. your mother suddenly fell ill

661
00:43:06,310 --> 00:43:08,187
what happened sir?
what happened to my mother?

662
00:43:08,187 --> 00:43:11,106
No, no. She's fallen sick.
You go home quickly

663
00:43:11,815 --> 00:43:13,901
But sir, mr. Khanna's call...

00:43:13,901 --> 00:43:15,861
Shoot Khanna's call. Go hurry up.

665
00:43:16,654 --> 00:43:17,071
Wait

666
00:43:17,738 --> 00:43:19,531

00:43:19,657 --> 00:43:24,452
No sir. Why take the trouble?
I will take a taxi and go. Ok sir.

668
00:43:27,372 --> 00:43:31,626
Sir...please pray to God for my mother

669
00:43:31,626 --> 00:43:34,420
Don't worry, Don't worry my son.
Everything will be alright. Go home.

670
00:43:37,298 --> 00:43:40,093
Wow! wow! This is called maternal Dedication

00:44:10,789 --> 00:44:13,583
-what's happening? Have you bought the stadium?
-hey, didn't I tell you. Sit there!

673
00:44:15,002 --> 00:44:18,130
Come, come, heroes, late latifs
my full moons

674
00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:21,425
-I've been waiting for an hour for you
-We were looking for you outside and you're seated here!

675
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:24,844
-want beetel nut?
-ask there
-you want?

676
00:44:50,202 --> 00:44:52,787
friend, if Govinda and Ashok Kumar were here
it would've been great

677
00:45:08,762 --> 00:45:10,013
-Ram prasad?
-Yes

678
00:45:11,431 --> 00:45:13,683
-Tell me one thing.
-what? Head clerk

679
00:45:14,517 --> 00:45:17,145
In a day, I pluck around 10-12 hairs from my nose

680
00:45:17,729 --> 00:45:20,899
Then where do these new hairs come from everyday?

681
00:45:21,358 --> 00:45:22,983
I was also thinking the same thing, head clerk

682
00:45:23,025 --> 00:45:23,651
what's that?

683
00:45:24,318 --> 00:45:27,738
If our country's soil would become like your nose,
it would be so good

684
00:45:28,072 --> 00:45:30,783
-meaning what?
-meaning today you gather a harvest

685
00:45:30,783 --> 00:45:32,034
Tomorrow, again a new harvest is ready

686
00:45:32,117 --> 00:45:35,537
There would be an instant solution
to the country's food shortage

687
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:41,543
-Ram prasad?
-Yes, head clerk

688
00:45:41,543 --> 00:45:44,546
Are you making fun of me?

689
00:45:44,797 --> 00:45:45,506
No, head clerk

690
00:45:47,174 --> 00:45:47,966
[Good morning sir]
-oh! Boss

691
00:45:50,511 --> 00:45:51,511
-Good morning Sir
-Good morning

692
00:45:51,969 --> 00:45:52,512
-Greetings, sir

693
00:46:06,818 --> 00:46:07,944
-Sir?

694
00:46:08,027 --> 00:46:08,820
Good news Sir

695
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:10,697
Ahuja & Ahuja have accepted their mistake

696
00:46:10,697 --> 00:46:13,324
please sign on this paper
we'll get back the 15000

697
00:46:13,324 --> 00:46:17,203
First tell me this
How is your mother now?

698
00:46:18,246 --> 00:46:19,247
Now she's fine, sir

699
00:46:19,747 --> 00:46:21,123
Doctor says, now there is nothing to worry

700
00:46:22,249 --> 00:46:23,834
But, what was her problem?

701
00:46:24,918 --> 00:46:27,754
She had trouble breathing
but now its gone

702
00:46:28,088 --> 00:46:30,048
What's gone? Breath or Trouble?

703
00:46:31,633 --> 00:46:33,927
Trouble sir
-ah! very good

704
00:46:35,304 --> 00:46:37,514
So, if yesterday, Govinda and
Ashok Kumar were there

705
00:46:37,514 --> 00:46:41,018
then it would have been great
fun at the test match. Yes?

706
00:46:41,935 --> 00:46:45,063
Test match? I didn't understand, sir

707
00:46:45,063 --> 00:46:46,106
Don't pretend!

708
00:46:46,106 --> 00:46:49,109
You damn liar!
You bluffer!

709
00:46:49,109 --> 00:46:52,945
I'm like your father and you dare to lie to me?

710
00:46:52,945 --> 00:46:54,447
Yes sir, No sir

711
00:46:54,447 --> 00:46:55,948
What do you mean? Yes sir, No sir.

712
00:46:56,574 --> 00:47:00,911
You are like my father. Yes sir for that
and you said I lied to you. No sir for that

713
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:04,040
Shut up!
I've seen you in the stadium with my own eyes

714
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:08,336
I was amazed at your impudence!
I had so much trust on you!

715
00:47:08,753 --> 00:47:10,379
[Friend. With this moustache you look very different]

716
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:17,261
[Yes friend. I have to do a double role for twins
One has moustache, other doesn't]

717
00:47:18,179 --> 00:47:20,096
I understood sir. I understood

718
00:47:20,764 --> 00:47:22,807
-But it is not your fault sir
-what do you mean?

719
00:47:23,350 --> 00:47:27,437
It's not the fault of your eyes too
But please sign this paper, then I'll tell you

720
00:47:27,437 --> 00:47:30,607
-what will you tell? "I'll tell"!
-don't be so agitated sir

721
00:47:30,607 --> 00:47:35,820
my father used to say that
"agitation is very harmful for health"

722
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:37,822
Listen, listen.
Don't..don't try to get smart with me

723
00:47:38,365 --> 00:47:41,576
No sir. You say that you saw
me at the stadium. Right?

724
00:47:41,576 --> 00:47:42,494
Yes!

725
00:47:42,869 --> 00:47:43,995
What was I wearing?

726
00:47:44,829 --> 00:47:47,165
-Hmm..you..you..
-Let me tell you sir

727
00:47:47,707 --> 00:47:50,626
The one you saw was
wearing some colourful clothes

728
00:47:50,626 --> 00:47:51,335
-Yes!

729
00:47:51,335 --> 00:47:53,587
-He had sunglasses on his eyes?
-yes, yes

730
00:47:53,587 --> 00:47:57,967
Hair must've been ruffled?
and at first glance looks like a hooligan?

731
00:47:57,967 --> 00:47:59,259
What are you trying to say?

732
00:47:59,259 --> 00:48:02,471
I'm trying to say that you
didn't see me there, sir

733
00:48:03,347 --> 00:48:05,516
Have you ever seen me wearing such clothes?

734
00:48:06,308 --> 00:48:09,728
But the mistake you made, sir
happens with other people all the time

735
00:48:10,479 --> 00:48:12,773
the one you saw wasn't Ram prasad

736
00:48:13,524 --> 00:48:15,651
He was Laxman prasad Dussherat prasad Sharma

737
00:48:15,651 --> 00:48:16,944
my twin brother

738
00:48:19,112 --> 00:48:20,279
-what?
-Yes sir

739
00:48:21,406 --> 00:48:22,991
but how did you make this mistake, sir?

740
00:48:23,783 --> 00:48:25,284
I have a moustache,
he is moustache shaven

741
00:48:25,284 --> 00:48:27,787
-moustache shaven?
-yes, Clean Shave

742
00:48:28,246 --> 00:48:29,372
think a bit sir

743
00:48:32,083 --> 00:48:37,213
Anyway, you are the master
If you want to dismiss me, then.....

744
00:48:37,213 --> 00:48:38,506
dismiss me

745
00:48:39,382 --> 00:48:41,134
But my father used to say

746
00:48:41,134 --> 00:48:45,888
"Son Ram prasad. Never tolerate
false accusation and injustice"

747
00:48:46,556 --> 00:48:48,724
And as you have lost your faith in me

748
00:48:49,641 --> 00:48:50,976
I can't work here

749
00:48:51,852 --> 00:48:54,730
please accept my resignation letter
greetings

750
00:48:55,188 --> 00:48:56,273
Listen! listen! listen!

751
00:48:56,857 --> 00:48:58,859
You were right.
maybe he didn't have a moustache

752
00:48:58,859 --> 00:49:00,652
maybe? What does "maybe" mean?

753
00:49:00,652 --> 00:49:03,196
How can someone without a
moustache have a moustache, sir?

754
00:49:04,948 --> 00:49:06,366
but Sir

755
00:49:06,366 --> 00:49:08,785
I considered you like a father

756
00:49:08,785 --> 00:49:11,330
And today you put this
false accusation on me

757
00:49:11,330 --> 00:49:14,833
son, son,son, I made a mistake
sit,sit, sit here

758
00:49:16,710 --> 00:49:19,795
You just said that I am like your father, right?

759
00:49:19,795 --> 00:49:22,798
Don't I even have the right to scold you?

760
00:49:22,798 --> 00:49:24,675
-Yes, you have the right, sir

761
00:49:25,843 --> 00:49:28,554
First tell me one thing
What does your brother do?

762
00:49:28,554 --> 00:49:32,600
He does nothing sir.
Entire day sports, songs, cinema

763
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:37,063
-means he doesn't earn?
-no sir, he doesn't earn but loses

764
00:49:38,481 --> 00:49:41,442
-meaning all household responsibility is on you?
-Yes sir

765
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:45,696
Do one thing

766
00:49:46,155 --> 00:49:49,866
Bring him here tomorrow
I will manage a job for him

767
00:49:50,909 --> 00:49:53,578
-No, no . This is impossible, sir
-why?

768
00:49:53,578 --> 00:49:55,372
He can't come wherever I am

769
00:49:56,122 --> 00:49:56,915
I didn't understand

770
00:49:57,374 --> 00:50:00,585
Sir, like I said, he doesn't know anything
except music, sports

771
00:50:00,585 --> 00:50:03,296
Ok Ok. Day after tomorrow is a holiday

772
00:50:03,296 --> 00:50:04,965
Send him to my house the
day after tomorrow morning

773
00:50:04,965 --> 00:50:07,550
He will teach my daughter music

774
00:50:07,550 --> 00:50:11,888
-Sir, you're taking one more trouble for me
-See! Don't stretch the matter

775
00:50:13,056 --> 00:50:14,557
for the injustice done on you today

776
00:50:14,557 --> 00:50:17,059
I have to do the penance for it

777
00:50:18,018 --> 00:50:19,103
Send him day after tomorrow morning

778
00:50:19,895 --> 00:50:23,732
Forget what I said.
Go and do your work. Go

779
00:50:50,591 --> 00:50:52,677
Kiddo! you are stuck

780
00:50:53,136 --> 00:50:56,639
See Deven. If I lose this job, it will be a disaster

781
00:50:57,223 --> 00:50:59,809
These days, no one gives a salary of Rs. 950

782
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:02,812
And I have to arrange Ratna's wedding

783
00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:09,736
See. You get me a false moustache.
Just like this. I'll take care of the rest

784
00:51:13,656 --> 00:51:15,408
-Silver Jubilee
-what?

785
00:51:16,158 --> 00:51:17,284
Golden Jubilee

786
00:51:17,909 --> 00:51:20,746
Hit! hit, hit, Super hit

787
00:51:21,663 --> 00:51:25,876
what's not there in this?
Sex, Emotion,motion

788
00:51:26,501 --> 00:51:28,962
Tragedy,Comedy,Family drama

789
00:51:29,421 --> 00:51:33,133
Cabaret, music, Sportsmanship.
It has everything

790
00:51:34,426 --> 00:51:36,762
Today itself, I'll tell this idea
to Rishi Kapoor

791
00:51:37,846 --> 00:51:39,139
-He'll become mad
-What?

792
00:51:39,848 --> 00:51:41,725
He will go mad. mad!

793
00:51:42,142 --> 00:51:44,186
What a brilliant Story!

794
00:51:44,978 --> 00:51:46,020
What a brilliant story!

795
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:50,816
Hero, clean shaven, teaches the Boss'
daugher music in the evening

796
00:51:51,233 --> 00:51:53,903
At night he roamances.
And in the morning?

797
00:51:54,236 --> 00:52:00,826
puts on a moustache, and works
in the Boss' office. Terrific!

798
00:52:01,494 --> 00:52:04,080
Yes. The way you double roles in movies

799
00:52:04,664 --> 00:52:06,624
Likewise, I have to do a double role in life

800
00:52:07,291 --> 00:52:08,793
But yes. Only for a day

801
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:10,461
Only for a day?

802
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:11,754
What do you mean?

803
00:52:12,713 --> 00:52:14,507
I will make such a nuisance
at the interview

804
00:52:14,756 --> 00:52:16,341
that Boss will throw me out
even before he asks me to sit

805
00:52:16,883 --> 00:52:20,303
After that, saying that my mother is ill,
I'll take leave for a week

806
00:52:20,762 --> 00:52:21,680
I'll grow my moustache back

807
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:25,600
shucks friend, you punctured the entire story

808
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:30,772
Sex, Romance, Love, Cabaret
you censored everything?

809
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:34,651
Anyway, I understand your problem

810
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:36,152
Your work will be done

811
00:52:37,362 --> 00:52:40,156
But what if I feel like sneezing

812
00:52:40,448 --> 00:52:42,492
and the moustache ends up
on the Boss' face?

813
00:52:42,867 --> 00:52:43,910
What are you talking about friend?

814
00:52:44,243 --> 00:52:47,746
Sneeze! Even if you are hung the
moustache will stick there

815
00:52:47,746 --> 00:52:49,790
I'll give you such spirit gum

816
00:52:50,291 --> 00:52:51,458
[Shot is ready]

817
00:52:52,418 --> 00:52:54,962
Ok. Now you go and shave your moustache

818
00:53:15,523 --> 00:53:17,734
[Topsy Turvy, brother all is Topsy Turvy]

819
00:53:20,278 --> 00:53:29,954
[Every straight way has a curved path]

820
00:53:30,330 --> 00:53:32,624
[Topsy Turvy, brother all is Topsy Turvy]

821
00:53:33,249 --> 00:53:35,084
[Topsy Turvy, Topsy Turvy]

822
00:53:35,585 --> 00:53:37,629
[Topsy Turvy, all is Topsy Turvy]

823
00:53:39,422 --> 00:53:40,423
Hi Gardner

824
00:53:42,592 --> 00:53:42,925
Hi

825
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:06,490
Is the old man at home?

826
00:54:07,032 --> 00:54:07,741
Which old man?

827
00:54:08,283 --> 00:54:09,868
That master of yours
Bhavani Shankar

828
00:54:11,244 --> 00:54:13,204
Who told you that Bhavani Shankar is old?

829
00:54:13,955 --> 00:54:17,291
O! gardner. One whose name is
Bhavani Shankar

830
00:54:17,291 --> 00:54:19,126
He grows old as soon as he's born

831
00:54:19,669 --> 00:54:21,629
Why? Isn't it true?
Ok. Go and call him

832
00:54:22,838 --> 00:54:23,589
Call him!

833
00:54:25,091 --> 00:54:26,634
You sit here. I'll call him

834
00:54:47,946 --> 00:54:48,947
Come in young man

835
00:54:56,288 --> 00:54:57,122
Good morning

836
00:54:57,789 --> 00:54:59,708
Good morning. You?

837
00:55:00,417 --> 00:55:01,459
my name is Bhavani Shankar

838
00:55:01,876 --> 00:55:03,503
By Joe!

839
00:55:04,421 --> 00:55:08,049
Do you also have a twin
who works here as a gardner?

840
00:55:08,049 --> 00:55:10,969
No. I don't have a gardner

841
00:55:11,594 --> 00:55:12,970
I manage my own garden

842
00:55:14,596 --> 00:55:16,473
-Oh! then I've made a big mistake
-what?

843
00:55:17,016 --> 00:55:19,184
-You know I called you Old
-So, what?

844
00:55:19,810 --> 00:55:23,731
-I am old
-Yes, you are old but.....

845
00:55:24,356 --> 00:55:27,026
You know, like you shouldn't
call a blind, a blind

846
00:55:27,026 --> 00:55:31,280
call a lame, a lame. similarly,
you shouldn't call an old person, Old.

847
00:55:31,905 --> 00:55:34,825
That strikes his heart. Am I right?

848
00:55:35,618 --> 00:55:38,287
-Sit down
-Thank you. Thank you sir!

849
00:55:38,287 --> 00:55:41,914
-What's your name?
-Lucky, Lucky Sharma

850
00:55:42,624 --> 00:55:43,458
Lucky?

851
00:55:43,750 --> 00:55:47,045
Well the name is Laxman prasad but
friends call me Lucky

852
00:55:47,462 --> 00:55:49,047
-you can also say that
-No!

853
00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:51,007
I'll say Laxman prasad only

854
00:55:53,051 --> 00:55:55,303
As you please sir.
your wish

855
00:55:55,803 --> 00:56:00,058
If you want, you can call me
Laxman prasad Dussherat prasad Sharma

856
00:56:00,308 --> 00:56:02,352
That reminds me
Fullname reminds me

857
00:56:03,019 --> 00:56:07,023
Brother was saying that you
are in need of a music teacher

858
00:56:10,485 --> 00:56:11,109
That is there

859
00:56:11,735 --> 00:56:13,320
-But there are two conditions
-Conditions?

860
00:56:13,654 --> 00:56:14,947
Yes. First condition

861
00:56:15,739 --> 00:56:18,158
Your salary will be Rs. 200 per month

862
00:56:18,533 --> 00:56:21,995
but you won't get the salary
Ram prasad will get it

863
00:56:21,995 --> 00:56:22,788
why is that?

864
00:56:23,330 --> 00:56:26,416
-I said this is my first condition
-Ok, ok. Agreed. What next?

865
00:56:27,167 --> 00:56:28,001
Next is

866
00:56:28,335 --> 00:56:30,545
my daughter will decide if you
are capable ot teaching music

867
00:56:31,797 --> 00:56:34,925
Sorry Sir! These conditions aren't
acceptable to me

868
00:56:35,384 --> 00:56:39,137
The way your daughter will decide
if I'm capable of teaching music

869
00:56:39,429 --> 00:56:42,348
Similarly, an artist like me should
get the right to

870
00:56:42,348 --> 00:56:45,309
decide if your daughter is
capable of learning music

871
00:56:46,269 --> 00:56:47,520
That's fair. Quite fair

872
00:56:47,937 --> 00:56:48,145
-Daddy?

873
00:56:49,021 --> 00:56:50,815
-Urmilla, he has come to teach you music
-Hi

874
00:56:51,357 --> 00:56:53,484
His name is
Laxman prasad Dussherat prasad Sharma

875
00:56:53,943 --> 00:56:55,027
-what was the name?
-just a minute

876
00:56:56,362 --> 00:56:59,031
-You can call me lucky
-ok. Its alright

877
00:56:59,323 --> 00:57:02,410
-I'll call you mister Lucky
-No, no. No need to add 'mister'

878
00:57:02,827 --> 00:57:05,204
-You can just call me Lucky

879
00:57:05,955 --> 00:57:08,624
and instead of miss Urmila,
I'll call you Mili

880
00:57:08,624 --> 00:57:13,128
No! you'll call her miss Urmilla
and she'll call you master

881
00:57:15,588 --> 00:57:16,756
whatever you say sir

882
00:57:17,215 --> 00:57:20,176
Urmilla, see if he is capable
of teaching music

883
00:57:20,510 --> 00:57:22,804
And you also see if she is
capable of learning music

884
00:57:23,763 --> 00:57:26,433
-please. Lets go to the music room
-Let's go

885
00:57:27,976 --> 00:57:31,646
And one thing.
music is a very difficult thing

886
00:57:32,314 --> 00:57:33,231
-Mili
-what?

887
00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:35,692
-I mean miss Urmila
-Yes

888
00:57:36,359 --> 00:57:41,113
miss Urmilla, music is an Art
Its not a Business or Accountancy

889
00:57:42,364 --> 00:57:46,660
In music, 2 and 2 can not only be 4
It can be 5, it can be 3

890
00:57:47,453 --> 00:57:48,871
It can also be Zero

891
00:57:50,122 --> 00:57:51,165
-Lets go
-lets go

892
00:57:58,505 --> 00:57:59,965
"Yet to grow teeth and befriending already!"

893
00:58:02,092 --> 00:58:04,428
Come. please come in

894
00:58:10,308 --> 00:58:13,394
Beautiful!
Did you do all this?

895
00:58:13,770 --> 00:58:14,395
Yes

896
00:58:14,938 --> 00:58:15,897
Fantastic!

897
00:58:17,357 --> 00:58:20,443
See. please don't fail
me by taking a test

898
00:58:21,611 --> 00:58:22,904
I don't know how to sing

899
00:58:23,404 --> 00:58:25,657
Especially, in front of you
I can't sing

900
00:58:26,366 --> 00:58:27,116
Why?

901
00:58:28,451 --> 00:58:31,371
You're such a great artist
and I..

902
00:58:32,705 --> 00:58:33,915
That...I was....

903
00:58:34,916 --> 00:58:38,752
Last year, didn't you sing at Ravi Bhavan
in the contemporary artist's meet

904
00:58:39,836 --> 00:58:42,673
Truly speaking, my interest in
singing started that day

905
00:58:43,590 --> 00:58:44,925
I looked for you a lot

906
00:58:45,550 --> 00:58:50,180
I reached there just after your song began
so, I didn't get your name

907
00:58:51,515 --> 00:58:52,474
God is Great!

908
00:58:52,975 --> 00:58:54,851
-That was very good
-Yes?

909
00:58:55,435 --> 00:58:58,772
I mean, what's in a name

910
00:58:58,981 --> 00:59:03,110
-the real thing is music
-I understood that listening to your song

911
00:59:04,278 --> 00:59:06,822
please sing that song again

912
00:59:07,489 --> 00:59:07,905
please

913
00:59:09,865 --> 00:59:14,829
That day I felt as if
the world is a big open field

914
00:59:15,871 --> 00:59:19,500
And in that field, I'm alone
with your voice

915
00:59:20,293 --> 00:59:22,378
since then I've been
searching for that voice

916
00:59:23,462 --> 00:59:25,423
I dream while sleeing or awake

917
00:59:26,215 --> 00:59:28,551
Sitting or standing,
I keep thinking about you that..

918
00:59:48,695 --> 01:00:05,879
The soon to come moment is about to go...

919
01:00:06,338 --> 01:00:10,341
If you can, live your life in this...

920
01:00:10,841 --> 01:00:14,970
moment that is about to go.

921
01:00:15,888 --> 01:00:22,978
The soon to come moment is about to go...

922
01:00:24,438 --> 01:00:27,858
If you can, live your life in this...

923
01:00:28,567 --> 01:00:31,487
moment that is about to go.

924
01:00:50,922 --> 01:01:06,895
Once, (I) just met this innocent blossom (bud).

925
01:01:08,647 --> 01:01:11,692
Blooming, (she) said

926
01:01:13,110 --> 01:01:16,321
I am leaving happy.

927
01:01:17,489 --> 01:01:18,865
When I look, it is right here.

928
01:01:19,408 --> 01:01:21,576
When I search, it is not here.

929
01:01:22,077 --> 01:01:25,581
This moment that is about to go.

930
01:01:26,873 --> 01:01:34,089
The soon to come moment is about to go...

931
01:01:35,256 --> 01:01:39,093
If you can, live your life in this...

932
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:42,722
moment that is about to go.

933
01:02:24,596 --> 01:02:40,861
Once, this moment fell from time somewhere.

934
01:02:42,488 --> 01:02:45,616
There I found this tale.

935
01:02:46,951 --> 01:02:49,995
The moment is nowhere.

936
01:02:51,121 --> 01:02:52,581
By making you laugh a little.

937
01:02:53,332 --> 01:02:55,334
By making you cry a little.

938
01:02:55,751 --> 01:02:58,587
This moment is also about to go.

939
01:03:00,422 --> 01:03:07,845
The soon to come moment is about to go...

940
01:03:08,805 --> 01:03:12,600
If you can, live your life in this...

941
01:03:13,309 --> 01:03:15,979
moment that is about to go.

942
01:03:18,231 --> 01:03:35,205
The soon to come moment is about to go...

943
01:03:52,764 --> 01:03:56,018
Looks like Ram prasad is stuck somewhere
But where did he go?

944
01:03:56,351 --> 01:04:00,897
Don't know doctor uncle. This morning
he left so early, I didn't even know

945
01:04:01,565 --> 01:04:03,399
Since two days he looks very anxious

946
01:04:04,191 --> 01:04:05,443
I am anxious too

947
01:04:05,443 --> 01:04:10,990
Talking to Bhavani Shankar, I felt
someone at his office has betrayed him

948
01:04:12,074 --> 01:04:13,034
brother is here

949
01:04:13,451 --> 01:04:14,744
brother, doctor uncle is here

950
01:04:16,412 --> 01:04:17,163
what happened here?

951
01:04:19,624 --> 01:04:20,583
Greetings, uncle

952
01:04:20,583 --> 01:04:22,668
-what happened to your mouth?
-Nothing

953
01:04:22,668 --> 01:04:24,837
If nothing, why have you put
a hanky over it?

954
01:04:33,303 --> 01:04:35,931
-where did your moustache go?
-what have you done?

955
01:04:36,973 --> 01:04:39,935
working at Bhavani Shankar's office,
you shaved your moustache!

956
01:04:40,602 --> 01:04:41,061
your job is gone!

957
01:04:44,314 --> 01:04:46,316
-you called me, sir?
-yes, come, come

958
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:49,152
-yesterday Laxman came
-who sir?

959
01:04:49,819 --> 01:04:52,697
-Laxman, your brother
-Yes! my brother

960
01:04:55,075 --> 01:04:57,160
Can I say something?

961
01:04:58,119 --> 01:05:02,206
don't mind my saying but
he's a bit upstart

962
01:05:02,831 --> 01:05:06,543
-Why sir? Was he disrespectful?
-No no. He didn't do it on purpose

963
01:05:07,211 --> 01:05:09,797
But, he talked to me
thinking I was the gardner

964
01:05:11,340 --> 01:05:12,675
such a shameful thing, sir

965
01:05:12,675 --> 01:05:15,177
Sir, don't let him enter the house

966
01:05:15,177 --> 01:05:18,722
No, no, how can that be
he's your twin brother

967
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:23,894
Sir, how can I explain? my disaster
will be due to that twin brother

968
01:05:24,645 --> 01:05:24,728
New subtitle

969
01:05:24,728 --> 01:05:25,938
you are worrying unnecesarily

970
01:05:26,730 --> 01:05:30,401
We've to accept one thing. There is
great sweetness in his voice

971
01:05:30,401 --> 01:05:32,569
O yes! how is your mother's health?

972
01:05:32,860 --> 01:05:34,737
Now its alright, sir

973
01:05:35,697 --> 01:05:36,864
I'll come to meet her on sunday

974
01:05:40,577 --> 01:05:43,955
-whom will you come to meet, sir?
-your mother

975
01:05:44,372 --> 01:05:48,459
- No, no sir. As I said she's perfectly healthy now
-so what?

976
01:05:48,793 --> 01:05:51,671
your mother and I won't meet?
I'm coming on sunday

977
01:06:13,066 --> 01:06:13,734
[Action]

978
01:06:14,610 --> 01:06:19,740
Hey! babu, hey babu, wake up!
It's 4'0 clock. We've to sweep.

979
01:06:20,032 --> 01:06:21,325
Oh! why are you screaming?

980
01:06:22,534 --> 01:06:24,036
-what happened?

981
01:06:25,621 --> 01:06:29,791
Ooh! my hand hurts. How can I sweep?
And there is so much work to do

982
01:06:30,291 --> 01:06:32,585
Who is asking you to work?

983
01:06:33,002 --> 01:06:36,464
-Sit like a queen. I'll do all the work
-you are such a goodman

984
01:06:39,425 --> 01:06:40,885
may God bless you

985
01:06:42,053 --> 01:06:43,346
-O Gangu maid
-yes

986
01:06:43,554 --> 01:06:45,139
-I remembered something
-what?

987
01:06:45,598 --> 01:06:50,770
my guru used to teach me Yoga...
Yoga..come here

988
01:06:50,770 --> 01:06:53,272
I don't know anything about Yoga

989
01:06:53,773 --> 01:06:56,817
-with Yoga, all pain will vanish
-even backache?

990
01:06:56,817 --> 01:06:57,693
Yes, yes. Absolutely

991
01:06:58,236 --> 01:06:59,487
Now see. First stand like this

992
01:06:59,736 --> 01:07:02,113
In standing position,
lift one leg

993
01:07:02,697 --> 01:07:04,824
-like this?
-Yes. A little bit higher

994
01:07:05,075 --> 01:07:06,660
-Now put your hands on your hips
-here?

995
01:07:06,660 --> 01:07:10,455
Yes! yes! Now lean a bit to this side
towards me

996
01:07:10,455 --> 01:07:14,000
lean..lean..lean..lean..lean..
ok. Now stop

997
01:07:14,668 --> 01:07:17,629
Now lean a bit..lean..lean..lean
that side! that side!

998
01:07:17,629 --> 01:07:21,216
-this side?
-Go son. lean..lean..lean..

999
01:07:21,216 --> 01:07:26,972
Now slowly lift the other leg also. Lift it,
lift it, lift it, slowly..lift the other slowly

1000
01:07:28,890 --> 01:07:33,644
-your mother's #@, your sisters @#,
can't you just work? [Cut]

1001
01:07:34,311 --> 01:07:39,650
[very good, very good] Vinay, some tea?
I'll be back in 15 minutes.

1002
01:07:40,150 --> 01:07:40,985
-Bye
-Bye

1003
01:07:43,571 --> 01:07:44,405
Sit, sit , sit

1004
01:07:45,531 --> 01:07:50,202
So, now you need a mother. Friend,
your story is gettng very complicated

1005
01:07:50,619 --> 01:07:53,414
Earlier I was thinking of
directing your story myself

1006
01:07:53,414 --> 01:07:57,126
But now, it seems that I've to call
a hit commercial film director

1007
01:07:57,126 --> 01:07:59,294
Because there is no logic
in your story anymore

1008
01:07:59,961 --> 01:08:02,714
First you need a Kurta, then moustache,
then mother

1009
01:08:03,506 --> 01:08:06,259
In my story, I'll put a wife
in place of the mother

1010
01:08:06,968 --> 01:08:09,387
If there's a wife she'll be young.
If there's a young wife, there'll be sex.

1011
01:08:10,054 --> 01:08:12,181
If there's sex, there'll be romance.
If there's romance, there'll be songs

1012
01:08:12,515 --> 01:08:14,559
If there''s songs, there'll be a villian.
If there's a villian, he'll fight with the hero

1013
01:08:15,268 --> 01:08:15,977
Hero will chase him

1014
01:08:17,228 --> 01:08:19,939
Dev, you think of the story later.
First think about me.

1015
01:08:20,857 --> 01:08:22,233
I need a mother and
that too tomorrow

1016
01:08:22,692 --> 01:08:26,404
What's the problem in that? I'll tell Aruna
and she'll become your mother today itself

1017
01:08:26,905 --> 01:08:28,238
-Have you gone crazy?
-why?

1018
01:08:28,238 --> 01:08:30,073
-she'll look like ...
-what? your wife?

1019
01:08:30,490 --> 01:08:33,493
Aren't there 25-26 years old stepmoms?

1020
01:08:33,911 --> 01:08:36,163
Dev, I don't want a stepmom.
I want a real mother

1021
01:08:36,622 --> 01:08:38,874
-Real? You mean 40-50 years old?
-Yes

1022
01:08:39,166 --> 01:08:40,626
40-50 years old mother....

1023
01:08:41,627 --> 01:08:43,629
ms. Sarita won't do your mother's role

1024
01:08:44,338 --> 01:08:45,380
ms Nirupa is very busy

1025
01:08:46,506 --> 01:08:47,674
ms. Sulochna is from Kolapur itself

1026
01:08:48,216 --> 01:08:48,842
mother's role...

1027
01:08:49,593 --> 01:08:53,555
Yes! 4 days ago I was working in Basuda's
movie "Who's my mother?"

1028
01:08:53,889 --> 01:08:58,017
The mother's role is played by a lady from here.
What's her name? mrs. Srivastava

1029
01:08:58,142 --> 01:09:02,563
She's a rich lady, social worker.
She works in films as a hobby

1030
01:09:03,147 --> 01:09:06,734
Lets go to her
She won't say "No" to us

1031
01:09:07,235 --> 01:09:10,196
No, No.
No mr. Deven, I can't do this work

1032
01:09:12,198 --> 01:09:14,825
-If we are caught?
-caught?

1033
01:09:15,368 --> 01:09:18,204
-yes
-What's this you are saying mrs. Srivastava?

1034
01:09:18,996 --> 01:09:23,167
This is an artist's test
Its a challenge for you

1035
01:09:24,043 --> 01:09:27,170
Before you say "No",
please look at him once

1036
01:09:27,879 --> 01:09:35,679
middle class man, family's sole supporter
What'll happen if he loses his job?

1037
01:09:36,220 --> 01:09:37,472
Please look at him

1038
01:09:38,181 --> 01:09:41,476
How can this poor man's only
sister get married?

1039
01:09:42,143 --> 01:09:44,187
Who'll marry her, Mrs. Srivastava?

1040
01:09:44,896 --> 01:09:50,401
Consider it as a social work for
the women's society and do it. Please

1041
01:09:51,277 --> 01:09:52,236
Alright

1042
01:09:52,779 --> 01:09:56,698
No, no. I can't do it.
I don't have the courage.

1043
01:09:58,492 --> 01:09:59,910
I'm getting nervous right now

1044
01:09:59,910 --> 01:10:01,411
Mrs. Srivastava

1045
01:10:02,412 --> 01:10:07,709
You must've heard 'Father of the nation'.
Have you heard 'Mother of the nation'? No!

1046
01:10:07,709 --> 01:10:09,753
Why? Let me tell you.

1047
01:10:10,545 --> 01:10:16,009
It's easy to be a father, Mrs. Srivastava
and equally difficult a mother.

1048
01:10:16,802 --> 01:10:22,182
Its an honour to be someone's mother,
and today we've come to give you that honour.

1049
01:10:22,182 --> 01:10:25,936
I wish I had got this honour

1050
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:29,522
I wish I could be his mother

1051
01:10:32,858 --> 01:10:36,987
Please agree Mrs. Srivastava.
I'll give you the courage

1052
01:10:38,072 --> 01:10:42,493
Please come...Sit...Sit

1053
01:10:43,536 --> 01:10:46,664
You told me that your only daughter
married and went to Canada?

1054
01:10:47,373 --> 01:10:51,419
-yes
-and the house seems empty without her?

1055
01:10:52,253 --> 01:10:55,755
-yes
-her memories sadden you and you've no peace?

1056
01:10:56,756 --> 01:10:58,216
How old is your daughter?

1057
01:10:59,092 --> 01:11:02,846
-around 22 -23 years old
-Ratna is also 24-25 years old

1058
01:11:03,555 --> 01:11:06,141
-Ratna?
-Yes. His sister. The only sister

1059
01:11:06,891 --> 01:11:12,397
She'll get a mother, you'll get a daughter
and your emptiness will be over

1060
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:15,442
You'll only have to tolerate him

1061
01:11:16,359 --> 01:11:20,113
Don't get taken by his face,
he's quite intelligent

1062
01:11:20,113 --> 01:11:22,949
He's a chartered accountant,
very mannered

1063
01:11:24,034 --> 01:11:26,910
Son..touch your mother's feet

1064
01:11:29,830 --> 01:11:33,792
Long live. Long live my daughter
May you get my years

1065
01:11:34,626 --> 01:11:40,007
-My desire to see you brought me here
-Brother and I'll never forget your favour, aunty

1066
01:11:40,716 --> 01:11:42,551
By the way, is everything clear to you?

1067
01:11:43,427 --> 01:11:48,849
What's there to understand? Your father
and mother passed away. No, no.

1068
01:11:49,475 --> 01:11:53,687
Mother is still alive. I'm the mother
and I haven't passed away yet.

1069
01:11:54,979 --> 01:11:58,149
-And we are 3 people at home
-Not three aunty, four

1070
01:11:58,399 --> 01:11:59,609
-Four?
-Yes! four

1071
01:12:00,360 --> 01:12:03,237
O! yes, yes, four.
There's also one who isn't there

1072
01:12:03,946 --> 01:12:06,157
Laxman Prasad!
See, I haven't forgotten.

1073
01:12:06,991 --> 01:12:10,078
-Aunty, don't be nervous at all
-No, no. Why would I be nervous?

1074
01:12:10,078 --> 01:12:11,829
I'm not nervous at all. Yes!

1075
01:12:12,246 --> 01:12:14,248
[RamPrasad] Please come in sir
[gasps] they're here

1076
01:12:16,626 --> 01:12:17,627
Come in

1077
01:12:19,045 --> 01:12:19,420
Please come in, Sir

1078
01:12:23,925 --> 01:12:26,301
Why are you removing them?
Let the shoes be on

1079
01:12:35,143 --> 01:12:39,648
-What a holy atmosphere!
-Please sit, Sir

1080
01:12:41,274 --> 01:12:42,859
Ratna! O Ratna

1081
01:12:45,404 --> 01:12:50,158
-Let's go, aunty
-Hey! not aunty, mother,mother. Let's go

1082
01:12:51,201 --> 01:12:53,828
Wait! O! Good Lord

1083
01:12:54,870 --> 01:12:56,956
-Yes. Let's go now
-first fix your veil

1084
01:12:56,956 --> 01:13:00,001
-Yes, veil, veil. Let's go
-Slippers

1085
01:13:00,001 --> 01:13:03,087
Oh! thankyou, thankyou. Let's go

1086
01:13:07,967 --> 01:13:12,596
-I can't see your brother Laxman Prasad
-He's hardly at home to be seen

1087
01:13:13,389 --> 01:13:15,307
He is....He is....

1088
01:13:15,766 --> 01:13:18,227
Maybe he has gone to your place sir
to teach music

1089
01:13:18,227 --> 01:13:19,270
Greetings

1090
01:13:23,064 --> 01:13:27,068
I'm so fortunate that the dust
of your feet fell on this house

1091
01:13:27,485 --> 01:13:33,658
-don't say that, don't say that. The fortune
is mine. Please sit  -Please sit

1092
01:13:34,576 --> 01:13:38,121
-This is my little sister Ratna
-live long daughter. Sit

1093
01:13:38,121 --> 01:13:41,583
-She's doing her M.A. in Hindi
-M.A. in Hindi!

1094
01:13:41,583 --> 01:13:45,295
Why not, why not. After all you're
the daughter of a great father

1095
01:13:46,838 --> 01:13:48,798
-The mother should also get a little credit

1096
01:13:48,798 --> 01:13:52,801
Yes, why not? why not?
The hand that rocks the cradle rules the world

1097
01:13:54,553 --> 01:13:58,932
-Go daughter Ratna, get brother a cold drink
[ok]-sister, why the need for the trouble?

1098
01:13:58,932 --> 01:14:00,809
-what's the trouble in this?

1099
01:14:01,685 --> 01:14:05,856
Guest is God and
an offering has to be made to God

1100
01:14:06,523 --> 01:14:13,489
as the home's holy atmosphere, likewise
pure language, pure thoughts

1101
01:14:14,114 --> 01:14:16,784
Yes! How's your holy?.
I mean how's your health now?

1102
01:14:18,410 --> 01:14:25,249
Health..The way it's with health.
As long as I'm breathing, I'm breathing.

1103
01:14:25,833 --> 01:14:29,087
What are you saying.
May God give you a long life

1104
01:14:30,129 --> 01:14:32,423
What will I do with a long life?

1105
01:14:33,091 --> 01:14:37,053
I've just one daughter and by God's
grace, her wedding is arranged

1106
01:14:37,845 --> 01:14:40,181
And I've only one son whom you've
given employment

1107
01:14:40,181 --> 01:14:41,516
-Only one son!

1108
01:14:42,558 --> 01:14:46,312
Sir... the thing is, mother doesn't
count Laxman in anything

1109
01:14:46,813 --> 01:14:50,316
O! yes, yes. His being there
is as good as not being there

1110
01:14:50,858 --> 01:14:55,195
His father used to say
"Birth alone doesn't make you a son"

1111
01:14:56,321 --> 01:14:59,408
"Only after fulfilling his duties does
a son become a son in reality"

1112
01:14:59,866 --> 01:15:00,909
What high ideals!

1113
01:15:03,870 --> 01:15:05,664
Here. Please sweeten your mouth a little

1114
01:15:07,708 --> 01:15:12,337
-Coconut sweets! My mother used to make them
-This is also made by mother, sir

1115
01:15:13,380 --> 01:15:17,509
But why did you tell me to sweeten my
mouth a little? I'm going to eat all of it.

1116
01:15:19,845 --> 01:15:22,138
Now, whenever I am free,
I'll come here

1117
01:15:22,471 --> 01:15:23,264
Why?

1118
01:15:23,639 --> 01:15:25,641
I meant why not, why not

1119
01:15:26,767 --> 01:15:30,688
-It is your home
-I have to come in greed of these sweets

1120
01:15:30,688 --> 01:15:33,274
No, no sir. Why trouble yourself for this?

1121
01:15:33,274 --> 01:15:36,402
Mother will make them and I'll
deliver them at the office

1122
01:15:36,402 --> 01:15:39,613
Yes, yes, I'll make lots of them.
Enough for 4-5 months

1123
01:15:39,613 --> 01:15:43,117
- Why Ratna? -Yes, mother
-Thank you. Thank you

1124
01:15:44,785 --> 01:15:47,038
sister, please rid me of a dilema

1125
01:15:48,331 --> 01:15:52,167
Apart from the moustache, there is no
difference between Ram and Laxman

1126
01:15:52,167 --> 01:15:54,711
How did you distinguish when they were kids?
Must have been very difficult.

1127
01:15:55,462 --> 01:15:57,672
O! yes, yes. It used to be very difficult

1128
01:15:58,631 --> 01:15:59,924
So, how did you distinguish between them?

1129
01:16:01,092 --> 01:16:02,469
-By their moustache
-Yes...huh?

1130
01:16:06,139 --> 01:16:09,100
Yes sir. Mother used to blunder a lot
when we were kids

1131
01:16:09,100 --> 01:16:11,644
If he had a cold, she'd wipe my nose

1132
01:16:11,644 --> 01:16:14,606
And if I had a tummy ache,
she'd give him the medicine

1133
01:16:15,148 --> 01:16:18,568
Then one day, with a pencil,
father made me a moustache

1134
01:16:18,568 --> 01:16:22,863
Since then sir. I've been with this
moustache since the age of 5

1135
01:16:23,572 --> 01:16:26,742
So, take care of your moustache, my son
take care of your moustache

1136
01:16:27,534 --> 01:16:31,330
-Ok sister. I don't feel like leaving
-But have to leave

1137
01:16:32,289 --> 01:16:34,375
-yes, have to go. Greetings
-Greetings

1138
01:16:35,334 --> 01:16:38,879
-Uncle, these sweets
-Yes! sweets, sweets

1139
01:16:39,380 --> 01:16:41,090
-I'll see him off till the car
-Yes, yes

1140
01:16:41,757 --> 01:16:42,591
Lets go

1141
01:16:56,729 --> 01:17:02,235
O! Ratna. Put on the fan daughter.Fan!
Full speed, fan. O! God.

1142
01:17:08,783 --> 01:17:10,368
Fabulous performance aunty

1143
01:17:13,329 --> 01:17:14,122
So?

1144
01:17:19,001 --> 01:17:22,546
Many, many thanks, Mrs. Srivastava
You were amazing in mother's role

1145
01:17:23,130 --> 01:17:25,132
And like a mother,
you saved from trouble

1146
01:17:28,010 --> 01:17:29,302
Take care of this Ram Prasad

1147
01:17:30,178 --> 01:17:33,682
Now, Ram Prasad will die and
Lucky Sharma will come alive

1148
01:17:34,558 --> 01:17:36,977
to teach music to Mr. Bhavani's daughter

1149
01:17:38,603 --> 01:17:39,730
Ok, Mrs. Srivastava

1150
01:17:40,689 --> 01:17:41,898
Should I make tea for you, aunty?

1151
01:17:43,275 --> 01:17:45,694
Ratna, daughter come near me

1152
01:17:47,654 --> 01:17:54,827
See, it's alright to call me aunty in public.
But can't you call me mother when alone?

1153
01:17:56,037 --> 01:17:57,246
Yes, mother

1154
01:18:09,842 --> 01:18:14,805
May I say something
if you accept

1155
01:18:14,805 --> 01:18:18,433

01:18:36,034 --> 01:18:45,293
I walk in my sleep
when I see you. Believe me

1160
01:19:03,769 --> 01:19:11,276
It happended yesterday too
You went past me

1161
01:19:12,319 --> 01:19:20,576
You were a bit disheveled,
a bit sad

1162
01:19:20,576 --> 01:19:25,456
I ran to cheer you up
in my dream

1163
01:19:25,456 --> 01:19:27,625
I feel down from the sofa

1164
01:19:29,544 --> 01:19:33,506

01:19:33,506 --> 01:19:38,052
Don't come in my dreams

I walk in my sleep
when I see you. Believe me

1167
01:20:05,037 --> 01:20:12,127
Day before yesterday,
You had called me

1168
01:20:13,420 --> 01:20:20,885
I had hid my face in your hands

1169
01:20:22,720 --> 01:20:26,307
I had kissed your hand in my sleep, but

1170
01:20:26,307 --> 01:20:28,976
But the kiss was on the bed

1171
01:20:30,895 --> 01:20:35,107
May I say something
if you accept

1172
01:20:35,107 --> 01:20:39,737
Don't come in my dreams

1173
01:20:49,371 --> 01:20:50,246

1174
01:20:51,998 --> 01:20:52,957
-Mother!
-Yes

1175
01:20:54,793 --> 01:20:57,379
-Remembered your daughter after so many days!
-I had gone to bangalore

1176
01:20:57,921 --> 01:20:58,922
-Take this
-What's it?

1177
01:20:58,922 --> 01:21:01,925
-A Cat
-Huh?
-Atleast take a look

1178
01:21:04,636 --> 01:21:08,181
-Goodness! It must be very expensive
-So what?

1179
01:21:08,890 --> 01:21:11,601
No, no. I can't accept such an
expensive Saree

1180
01:21:13,770 --> 01:21:18,983
Alright. If it was your real mother,
you wouldn't have thought of the price

1181
01:21:19,900 --> 01:21:24,113
You didn't let me finish. Only a saree
won't do. I'll also take ear rings

1182
01:21:24,113 --> 01:21:27,366
-just like the ones you've worn
-Oh! then have these ones

1183
01:21:27,366 --> 01:21:29,576
No, no. Why should I take second hand?
I'll take new ones

1184
01:21:29,576 --> 01:21:33,580
Ok. Lets go to a jeweller tomorrow
and you make the choice. Ok?

1185
01:21:34,498 --> 01:21:37,751
-what's this? you're looking at your watch already?
-I've to go someplace, daughter

1186

Please sit for a while

1187
01:21:39,128 --> 01:21:41,255
No dear. I've very important work

1188
01:21:41,964 --> 01:21:45,925
Understood. If I were a real daughter,
you wouldn't have left as soon as you came

1189
01:21:45,925 --> 01:21:47,802
If you say like that, I won't go at all

1190
01:21:47,802 --> 01:21:52,015
-where do you have to go?
-Can't you see how dressed I am?

1191
01:21:53,016 --> 01:21:54,392
There's a very important party

1192
01:22:01,399 --> 01:22:05,403
These days we don't have parties.
We have fashion parades in the name of parties

1193
01:22:06,112 --> 01:22:07,905
We have fancy dress shows.

1194
01:22:08,698 --> 01:22:12,368
Where have you come to?
The fashion parade or the fancy dress show?

1195
01:22:12,368 --> 01:22:16,121
Yes,yes. If you don't make fun of the national
dress, how can you be called Broad Minded?

1196
01:22:17,039 --> 01:22:20,751

-Hello Mr. Raman. How are you?
-Fine. Thank you

1202
01:22:54,325 --> 01:22:59,580
-What about Sushma's beauty contest
-Actually, my wife had objections in this matter

1203
01:22:59,580 --> 01:23:06,003
That's very backward thinking. Don't worry.
I'll convince her. Excuse me. I'll be back

1204
01:23:06,796 --> 01:23:09,548
-Sushila, how are you?
-I'm fine

1205

-when did u get this made?
-Today itself

1206
01:23:12,884 --> 01:23:17,180
Yes! I was also thinking of
getting a similar one made

1207
01:23:18,306 --> 01:23:20,642

Amazing. Not only your face but
I feel I've heard your voice before

1215
01:24:00,973 --> 01:24:02,433
I'm sure we've met before

1216
01:24:03,225 --> 01:24:07,396
- I see, I see. You've met Mrs. Sharma from Khar?
-Yes

1217
01:24:08,063 --> 01:24:11,275
Yes! Its alright.
That's why you have the confusion

1218
01:24:11,983 --> 01:24:14,902
-But sister is a widow
-Is she your sister?
-Yes

1219

Sister is a widow but still
people keep getting confused

1220

We are twins

1221
01:24:26,706 --> 01:24:29,292
Looks like in your family
there is a tradition of twins

1222
01:24:29,584 --> 01:24:35,214
You're right. Our granny were also twins.

-She is taking a bath
-Bathing?

1230
01:26:09,848 --> 01:26:12,850
Ok. Since I've come.
I'll meet her and go

1231
01:26:13,225 --> 01:26:15,019
Of course! Please sit

1232
01:26:25,195 --> 01:26:28,032
Excuse me. Any important work?

1233

-Yes. Consider it important
-You can tell me

1234
01:26:32,494 --> 01:26:36,832
I can ask her. Because she take
a long time to bathe

-Brother? I don't know

1243
01:28:06,335 --> 01:28:08,336
Why don't you know?
He has gone to the temple

Every tuesday he goes to the temple

He is full of traditions.
You know all these silly superstitions

-See, I don't want to argue with you

There is no point in discussing these things.
Because there is a big gap between you and me

Go daughter. Bring sweets for brother

01:30:11,706 --> 01:30:14,542
I'm very worried for this boy, brother

1272
01:30:15,209 --> 01:30:18,337
But God has also give you
a son like Ram Prasad

1273
01:30:19,213 --> 01:30:28,514
So principled...so truthful...
so hardworking....so well behaved

1274
01:30:29,181 --> 01:30:30,933
not enough words to praise

1275
01:30:31,601 --> 01:30:34,854
But these days Ram Prasad looks a bit worried

1276
01:30:34,854 --> 01:30:36,104
why worried?

1277
01:30:36,104 --> 01:30:40,734
Brother, he respects you a lot
almost worships you

1278
01:30:40,734 --> 01:30:47,824
He's afraid that he'll make a small mistake and
he'll become less in your eyes; then what will happen?

01:30:48,491 --> 01:30:53,413
Sister, Ram Prasad becoming less in my eyes?
It can't happen

1280
01:30:53,955 --> 01:30:58,668
No. He was saying that "one day
Sir had a wrong impression of me"

1281
01:30:58,835 --> 01:31:00,378
"He was going to fire me"

1282

But he's still afraid of being fired?

Sir, whenever I bow to the goddess,
I bow to my mother too

1289
01:31:29,490 --> 01:31:31,700
Because mother is greater than God

no one can even bend your hair

Let's go

1303
01:32:22,291 --> 01:32:25,544
We had thought that today brother is finished

1304
01:32:26,295 --> 01:32:30,048
-But how did you come suddenly?
-Yes, mother hears the cries

1305
01:32:30,591 --> 01:32:32,384
See this

1306
01:32:34,051 --> 01:32:36,929
-But how did you come into the house?
-Yes! from the back

1307
01:32:37,430 --> 01:32:38,723
Through the window of the kitchen

1308
01:32:39,181 --> 01:32:42,435
-You came through that?
-Yes, only I know how I came through

1309
01:32:43,060 --> 01:32:45,938
My waist got stuck.
Half in half out

1310
01:32:46,897 --> 01:32:51,152
I knew that Mr. Bhavani Shankar was already here.
I..[ouch]

1311
01:32:51,819 --> 01:32:56,657
-what happened?
-I got sprained jumping through the window

1312
01:32:57,241 --> 01:32:58,492
Wait. Let me put iodex on it

1313
01:33:05,332 --> 01:33:10,337
Mother, today I came to know something.
You must've been very naughty as a kid.

1314
01:33:11,504 --> 01:33:12,172
Yes

1315
01:33:12,797 --> 01:33:15,634
In my father's house, the kitchen
was on the second floor

1316
01:33:15,634 --> 01:33:17,385
There was a tree behind it

1317
01:33:17,594 --> 01:33:22,098
Climbing that tree I used to enter
the kitchen to steal pickles

1318
01:33:23,308 --> 01:33:25,393
Today, I really had the thrill of childhood

1319
01:33:27,646 --> 01:33:30,857
-what happened?
-mother knew that your boss was here

1320
01:33:30,857 --> 01:33:33,943
She jumped through the kitchen window
and sprained her leg

1321
01:33:35,069 --> 01:33:38,113
For us you've to take so much trouble, Mrs Srivastava
-Brother!

1322
01:33:38,697 --> 01:33:44,787
-From today, say 'Mother' instead of 'Mrs Srivastava'
-Yes, you are right

1323
01:33:46,538 --> 01:33:48,707
You must have been our mother in some previous life

1324
01:33:49,416 --> 01:33:51,085
I feel the same too

1325
01:33:51,669 --> 01:33:55,506
But tell me, I know how you changed your clothes

1326
01:33:55,506 --> 01:33:59,635
But how did you get the vermillion mark
on your head from the temple so quickly?

1327
01:34:00,094 --> 01:34:01,720
Mother, this vermillion is not from the temple

1328
01:34:02,637 --> 01:34:05,640
-this is the vermillion of the lips.
-Vermillion of the lips?

1329
01:34:07,058 --> 01:34:09,185
Yes. See this

1330
01:34:23,950 --> 01:34:26,369
Hey! Here eat this.

1331
01:34:27,328 --> 01:34:28,871
-what?
-'Dahi Bada'

1332
01:34:29,497 --> 01:34:31,790
No. I don't feel like eating

1333
01:34:32,040 --> 01:34:34,376
What? You don't feel like eating 'Dahi Bada'?

1334
01:34:36,211 --> 01:34:36,837
No

1335
01:34:37,337 --> 01:34:41,258
If a girl refuses to eat 'Dahi Bada', it has two meanings

1336
01:34:42,426 --> 01:34:44,970
Either she is slowly becoming a boy

1337
01:34:44,970 --> 01:34:48,765
-My head!
-No no. I didn't see those signs either

1338
01:34:49,182 --> 01:34:50,851
Then, the other thing is true

1339
01:34:51,643 --> 01:34:52,561
What's the other thing?

1340
01:34:53,145 --> 01:34:55,105
Surely, you've caught the disease of love

1341
01:34:55,606 --> 01:34:56,315
Who is he?

1342
01:34:56,940 --> 01:34:59,109
-There is no one
-See, you shouldn't lie

1343
01:34:59,610 --> 01:35:06,324
One day I also didn't feel like eating 'dahi bada'
the next day I knew that I was in love with Bantu

1344
01:35:07,074 --> 01:35:08,200
Yes. What's his name?

1345
01:35:09,911 --> 01:35:12,830
Lucky. I mean Laxman Prasad

1346
01:35:13,706 --> 01:35:16,083
Isn't he the one who comes to teach you music?

1347
01:35:19,170 --> 01:35:21,964
Hey Urmi. How is it like to be in love?

1348
01:35:23,090 --> 01:35:29,221
I don't understand Pushpa. As long as Lucky
is with me, life seems so enjoyable

1349
01:35:30,263 --> 01:35:35,185
But when he leaves, it feels like
there is nothing left in life

1350
01:35:37,354 --> 01:35:39,439
So the matter has gone this far

1351
01:35:40,148 --> 01:35:41,566
Has he started coming in your dreams?

1352
01:35:42,400 --> 01:35:43,360
Sometimes

1353
01:35:44,778 --> 01:35:47,364
-what does he say when he comes?
-He comes and teaches me music

1354
01:35:48,240 --> 01:35:51,409
Brother, let me say what I've come to say.
Don't interrupt in between

1355
01:35:51,409 --> 01:35:53,870
That's your bad habit.
You don't let me say anything

1356
01:35:54,704 --> 01:35:56,665
Whatever you have to say, say in half a minute

1357
01:35:56,665 --> 01:35:59,750
half a minute is alright.
I need less than half a minute

1358
01:36:00,542 --> 01:36:02,920
I'm telling! I'm telling.
Don't confuse me by staring at me.

1359
01:36:03,337 --> 01:36:06,173
I came to say that these days
Urmilla's signs aren't good

1360
01:36:06,548 --> 01:36:07,841
What do you have to say?
Say it clearly and frankly

1361
01:36:08,259 --> 01:36:13,013
She mumbles at night. Yesterday, I don't know
what she was mumbling taking Laxman's name

1362
01:36:13,681 --> 01:36:16,183
-Taking Laxman's name?
-nothing wrong with the boy.

1363
01:36:16,934 --> 01:36:19,395
But it's our Urmi who is a bit too drawn towards him

1364
01:36:19,645 --> 01:36:24,400
I say brother. Find a nice boy and
do a quick engagement and marriage

1365
01:36:25,734 --> 01:36:28,988
But sir. What did Laxman do?

1366
01:36:29,737 --> 01:36:33,491
No. No. I can't put any blame on Laxman

1367
01:36:34,033 --> 01:36:35,827
But this is the thing Ram Prasad

1368
01:36:36,536 --> 01:36:41,082
That Urmila, my daughter can't distinguish
between gold and brass

1369
01:36:41,541 --> 01:36:44,002
She doesn't know what's good for her
and what's not good for her

1370
01:36:44,711 --> 01:36:47,630
-But she should know this, right?
-Naturally sir.

1371
01:36:49,132 --> 01:36:53,845
In the pursuit of dancing, singing and parties,
Urmila has neglected her studies

1372
01:36:54,846 --> 01:37:01,268
Starting today, after office hours,
if you can tution her a little,
I'll be very grateful to you

1373
01:37:01,810 --> 01:37:03,854
What is this you are saying, sir?

1374
01:37:04,605 --> 01:37:06,648
But Sir.......

1375
01:37:07,608 --> 01:37:10,903
Laxman Prasad. What about him?

1376
01:37:11,862 --> 01:37:13,947
Tell him not to come to my house today onwards

1377
01:37:14,031 --> 01:37:14,948
Why won't he come daddy?

1378
01:37:15,032 --> 01:37:18,243
It's hard to find such a good music teacher
not only in Bombay but the whole world.

1379
01:37:18,535 --> 01:37:23,498
Its just hard, right? But its impossible
to get a teacher like Ram Prasad. Impossible

1380
01:37:23,498 --> 01:37:25,500
-But daddy
-No buts!

1381
01:37:26,084 --> 01:37:30,212
Enough music lessons. Exams are near.
Do a bit of studying too!

1382
01:37:32,590 --> 01:37:35,384
Ram Prasad has agreed after a lot of hesitation

1383
01:37:36,010 --> 01:37:40,222
I want you to see him and learn
what a good man is like

1384
01:37:40,848 --> 01:37:44,644
Both twin brothers. But there is a difference
of heaven and earth between them

1385
01:37:45,144 --> 01:37:47,146
Where is Laxman Prasad
and where is Ram Prasad!

1386
01:37:47,897 --> 01:37:49,023
I'm here sir

1387
01:37:49,774 --> 01:37:52,818
Come, come son Ram Prasad
Come here. Come here

1388
01:37:53,361 --> 01:37:55,279
We were just talking about you

1389
01:37:57,864 --> 01:38:00,492
What's this? These clothes? This moustche?

1390
01:38:01,743 --> 01:38:03,495
You also got fooled

1391
01:38:03,495 --> 01:38:06,456
This isn't Laxman.
His twin brother, Ram.

1392
01:38:06,915 --> 01:38:08,625
And this is my sister, Kalindi

1393
01:38:09,042 --> 01:38:10,335
-Greetings
-live long. live long

1394
01:38:10,835 --> 01:38:12,212
And this is Urmila

1395
01:38:12,212 --> 01:38:12,837
Greetings

1396
01:38:14,923 --> 01:38:17,133
Son, today onwards, you take all
her responsibility

1397
01:38:17,842 --> 01:38:21,888
-What?
-I mean..the responsitility of studies

1398
01:38:22,514 --> 01:38:24,933
But sir. Where will the studies take place?

1399
01:38:25,350 --> 01:38:26,977
Here. In this room

1400
01:38:27,643 --> 01:38:29,603
No sir. What I meant was

1401
01:38:29,853 --> 01:38:33,023
In such a big room, studies can't
be done properly

1402
01:38:33,983 --> 01:38:36,068
We get distracted easily

1403
01:38:36,860 --> 01:38:42,783
For studies you need a small room.
Separate. Very quiet

1404
01:38:43,659 --> 01:38:48,038
He's right daddy. I'll fix the room upstairs
and we can start studying tomorrow

1405
01:38:48,038 --> 01:38:52,543
-Why not today?
-You know Pushpa? Its her birthday today

1406
01:38:53,460 --> 01:38:55,421
Ok sir. We'll start from tomorrow

1407
01:38:55,796 --> 01:38:59,173
By the way, tomorrow is a good day.
Auspicious Wednesday

1408
01:38:59,549 --> 01:39:01,342
-Ok daddy, I'm leaving. Goodbye
-Goodbye

1409
01:39:02,343 --> 01:39:04,596
-Ok Sir. I'll also go
-How can this be?

1410
01:39:04,596 --> 01:39:08,266
You've come to this house for the first time
How can you leave without eating and drinking?

1411
01:39:08,933 --> 01:39:10,143
-Sit
-Yes, sit

1412
01:39:14,063 --> 01:39:18,026
-Here. Eat this. I'll get some more for brother
-Eat the sweets. Eat.

1413
01:39:32,289 --> 01:39:33,957
-Greetings
-Greetings. Say

1414
01:39:34,708 --> 01:39:37,920
-Is Mr. Lucky home?
-Mr. Lucky doesn't live here

1415
01:39:38,211 --> 01:39:40,172
I mean Mr. Laxman

1416
01:39:40,672 --> 01:39:42,925
O! you're looking for little brother

1417
01:39:43,550 --> 01:39:45,761
-Are you Ms. Urmila?
-How did you know?

1418
01:39:45,761 --> 01:39:47,012
Please come inside

1419
01:39:50,098 --> 01:39:55,145
Little brother talks about you so much
that I know you by heart

1420
01:39:55,604 --> 01:39:57,230
What does he say about me?

1421
01:39:57,772 --> 01:40:03,569
One day he said, "Ratna, my Urmila isn't a girl
she's the imagination of a poet"

1422
01:40:04,237 --> 01:40:07,114
-My Urmila?
-Yes. You must've read Ramayana

1423
01:40:07,657 --> 01:40:10,326
What else will Laxman call Urmila if not 'my'?

1424
01:40:10,743 --> 01:40:12,787
-Please call him
-He isn't home

1425
01:40:14,288 --> 01:40:17,708
- When will he be back?
-Can't say. He's the master of his will

1426
01:40:18,334 --> 01:40:21,087
-Then give me a paper. I'll leave a letter for him
-Ok

1427
01:40:25,966 --> 01:40:28,802
You write the letter. I'll make some tea for you

1428
01:40:28,802 --> 01:40:31,972
Today I'm in a hurry. I'll drink it some other day

1429
01:40:37,936 --> 01:40:42,274
-See. Please give this letter to him only
-Its for him so I'll give it to him only

1430
01:40:46,403 --> 01:40:51,157
-Can I get an envelope?
-No need of an envelope.
Please fold it and I'll give it to him by hand

1431
01:40:51,658 --> 01:40:53,910
-I won't read it
-No, no. It's not like that

1432
01:40:54,452 --> 01:40:56,954
-The letter was a bit personal so..
-All understood. Don't worry at all

1433
01:40:56,954 --> 01:40:58,622
I'll give it to him alone

1434
01:41:08,382 --> 01:41:08,757
Let's go

1435
01:41:27,025 --> 01:41:29,736
-Ratna...Ratna
-What is it brother?

1436
01:41:30,445 --> 01:41:31,487
Why did Urmila come?

1437
01:41:33,114 --> 01:41:35,366
-To meet brother Laxman
-What was she saying?

1438
01:41:36,367 --> 01:41:38,745
-She has left a letter for him
-Give it to me

1439
01:41:38,870 --> 01:41:41,080
Why should I give it to you?
Letter is for brother Laxman

1440
01:41:41,080 --> 01:41:48,588
-Don't joke. -I'm not joking big brother.
I promised that I'll give the letter only to
younger brother

1441
01:41:49,631 --> 01:41:53,176
-Here is your younger brother
-Ok. Now I can give you

1442
01:41:58,722 --> 01:42:00,265
-I'm dead
-What happened?

1443
01:42:01,558 --> 01:42:04,686
-She's asked to meet tomorrow at quater to 7
-So what? Meet her

1444
01:42:05,062 --> 01:42:08,982
What meet her! I'll get to her house at 5:30
and start teaching her

1445
01:42:08,982 --> 01:42:13,695
Studies will finish at 6:30. She'll reach that
place easily in her car.

1446
01:42:13,695 --> 01:42:18,408
But how can I change from Ram Prasad
to Laxman Prasad and reach there in 15 minutes?

1447
01:42:18,408 --> 01:42:19,243
Meet her!

1448
01:42:22,913 --> 01:42:24,038
There's only one way

1449
01:42:24,664 --> 01:42:29,293
Says Kabir. Be of one name.
Neither Hindu neither Turkish

1450
01:42:30,503 --> 01:42:37,009
So is it illogical to deduce from this that
he doesn't take anyone's side?

1451
01:42:37,885 --> 01:42:43,558
Saint Kabir, by comparing
the religion and works of both...

1452
01:42:44,850 --> 01:42:47,520
Why do you keep looking at the watch?
Please concentrate on the studies

1453
01:42:47,520 --> 01:42:50,815
-It's 6:30 now
-Everyday it's 6:30 at this time

1454
01:42:50,815 --> 01:42:55,277
-It's one hour. I won't study anymore
-But half of the paragraph is still remaining

1455
01:42:55,944 --> 01:43:04,452
To study Kabir, one lifetime is less
but I'll try to finish by 7:30

1456
01:43:05,120 --> 01:43:09,374
-So, saint Kabir....
-Listen. I can't study more than an hour

1457
01:43:09,374 --> 01:43:10,500
I get tired

1458
01:43:11,042 --> 01:43:14,045
-But this paragraph...
-We'll finish tomorrow. Goodbye

1459
01:43:18,967 --> 01:43:20,927
-Studies over?
-Yes
-Have some tiffin

1460
01:43:20,927 --> 01:43:26,807
-Today I'm in a hurry...
-You're coming straight from work.
You have to eat. Brother's command.

1461
01:43:32,688 --> 01:43:34,315
What's the hurry?

1462
01:43:35,232 --> 01:43:38,694
-I'm very hungry
-Ok, ok. Eat, eat. I'll get some more

1463
01:43:54,375 --> 01:43:59,005
-So you're here.
-Go,go. I'm late. Chandan cinema

1464
01:44:20,777 --> 01:44:23,904
Brother in law. Brother in law
What are you doing here?

1465
01:44:23,904 --> 01:44:28,951
-Your wife is waiting for you there
-Wife?
-Yes. See there. She's waiting there

1466
01:44:30,911 --> 01:44:33,705
Hey! what are you doing. I'm in a hurry.
Open the door. I say, open the door

1467
01:44:34,790 --> 01:44:36,041
What happened brother? What happened?

1468
01:44:36,041 --> 01:44:40,796
See, I was going in.
A guy called me brother in law and I stopped

1469
01:44:40,796 --> 01:44:43,090
He went inside and closed the door.
Is this the way?

1470
01:44:43,715 --> 01:44:45,509
-His need was greater than yours
-Meaning what?

1471
01:44:45,842 --> 01:44:48,053
Meaning, his need was more pressing than yours

1472
01:44:48,053 --> 01:44:53,099
What are you saying? Helen has started dancing
and singing. I still couldn't hold it.

1473
01:44:53,683 --> 01:44:56,060
You are saying that his need was more than mine?

1474
01:44:57,103 --> 01:44:59,146
-Thank you brother in law
-'Saala' [swear word]

1475
01:44:59,564 --> 01:45:03,943
-What did you say?
-Brother, he called me brother in law so isn't
he my 'Saala' [also mean's wife's brother]

1476
01:45:04,485 --> 01:45:07,655
-Correct
-Mr. Saala, may I ask something?

1477
01:45:08,489 --> 01:45:12,785
You did that thing, changed clothes
and shaved your moustache so quickly?

1478
01:45:13,578 --> 01:45:15,913
This is called 'Jet Age' ..Ta ta

1479
01:45:21,459 --> 01:45:25,714
Come. Come. O Urmi. Mr. Lucky is here

1480
01:45:27,924 --> 01:45:29,217
You!

1481
01:45:33,847 --> 01:45:37,767
-Why are you so late?
-Its my magic that I came so early

1482
01:45:38,143 --> 01:45:39,728
Huh! Came early! Come

1483
01:45:43,940 --> 01:45:44,608
Sit

1484
01:45:46,735 --> 01:45:48,194
Why did you call me here?

1485
01:45:49,029 --> 01:45:53,699
We have to meet somewhere.
I can't live without meeting you

1486
01:45:54,575 --> 01:45:57,453
And if we've to meet like this daily,
it'll be difficult for me to live

1487
01:45:58,787 --> 01:46:02,166
Yes, yes. I know your eyes are big.
See. I'm a straightforward man

1488
01:46:03,334 --> 01:46:06,670
Why should we meet in hiding?
If we have to meet like this then........

1489
01:46:09,340 --> 01:46:13,177
-Forget me
-Are you history that I should read and forget?

1490
01:46:14,261 --> 01:46:18,140
I'm not but I'll become history.
You dad doesn't like me at all

1491
01:46:18,140 --> 01:46:19,224
So what?

1492
01:46:19,557 --> 01:46:21,893
He must have thought it over and fired me

1493
01:46:21,893 --> 01:46:24,812
And he must have made brother your teacher
after thinking it over

1494
01:46:24,812 --> 01:46:27,440
-If not one brother, then the other
-what?

1495
01:46:28,149 --> 01:46:30,526
Yes. Its ab. simple

1496
01:46:31,194 --> 01:46:34,906
If you start looking at brother,
you'll start seeing me in him

1497
01:46:34,906 --> 01:46:37,408
Don't you have shame? Canvassing for your brother!

1498
01:46:38,159 --> 01:46:42,830
What shame is there in it? One who is Ram
is Laxman and one who is Laxman is Ram

1499
01:46:42,830 --> 01:46:47,001
Rubbish! That moustached stupid Ram!
He can't equal in seven lives.

1500
01:46:47,252 --> 01:46:50,045
-There is no question of equality
-Here is your tea

1501
01:46:52,089 --> 01:46:53,757
Thanks a lot

1502
01:46:55,759 --> 01:46:59,805
Listen. We can't talk here.
Let's meet at Juhu beach tomorrow. Ok?

1503
01:47:01,265 --> 01:47:06,436
Those who meet don't meet. In reality,
only those meet who don't meet.

1504
01:47:07,229 --> 01:47:10,857
Because what is, isn't there
and what isn't there, is there

1505
01:47:12,109 --> 01:47:18,656
This isn't merely a play of words
And even if its a play, it is the vision

1506
01:47:19,615 --> 01:47:25,830
and within this meeting or not meeting,
being or not being, lies the ocean of illusion

1507
01:47:40,261 --> 01:47:56,735
[Once, this moment fell from time somewhere]

1508
01:47:58,278 --> 01:48:05,952
[There I found this tale.
The moment is nowhere.]

1509
01:48:06,828 --> 01:48:10,874
[By making you laugh a little.
By making you cry a little.]

1510
01:48:11,458 --> 01:48:14,294
[This moment is also about to go.]

1511
01:48:16,046 --> 01:48:24,053
[The soon to come moment is about to go]

1512
01:48:24,553 --> 01:48:28,432
[If you can, live your life in this]

1513
01:48:29,099 --> 01:48:32,603
[moment that is about to go.]

1514
01:48:33,604 --> 01:48:50,787
[The soon to come moment is about to go]

1515
01:48:58,878 --> 01:49:01,881
-But why is he coming to meet me again today?
-I don't know

1516
01:49:02,382 --> 01:49:05,009
Yesterday, in the office he suddenly said
"I'll come to meet your mother"

1517
01:49:05,009 --> 01:49:06,302
"I've very important work"

1518
01:49:06,970 --> 01:49:11,224
I don't like this anymore. What will he think
about us the day he finds out?

1519
01:49:11,224 --> 01:49:14,102
What do you think?
I like all this drama? But what can I do?

1520
01:49:14,811 --> 01:49:19,648
-Take courage and tell him everything one day
-Yes! He'll hold me by the ear me and fire me

1521
01:49:21,525 --> 01:49:22,776
Looks like he's arrived

1522
01:49:23,527 --> 01:49:26,196
But mother we have to do something.

1523
01:49:27,155 --> 01:49:31,118
-Please come
-Greetings  - Greetings
-You please sit -you please sit

1524
01:49:37,583 --> 01:49:39,418
-How is your health now?
-Your mercies

1525
01:49:42,754 --> 01:49:45,007
Today I've come to discuss
some important matters

1526
01:49:45,840 --> 01:49:47,133
Yes, yes. Why not?

1527
01:49:49,218 --> 01:49:51,053
The matter is...sister

1528
01:49:51,470 --> 01:49:56,434
Sir..if you wish..we...outside
-No no. Actually I've come to talk about you

1529
01:50:02,148 --> 01:50:06,360
I have come to pray to you.
Please give my daughter a place at your feet

1530
01:50:06,861 --> 01:50:09,238
I've brought her proposal for Ram Prasad

1531
01:50:12,867 --> 01:50:17,495
What are you saying? You're so wealthy
and this is a small house

1532
01:50:17,495 --> 01:50:19,998
Big or small is of a person's heart, sister

1533
01:50:19,998 --> 01:50:23,501
What if your house is small?
The heart is so big!

1534
01:50:23,501 --> 01:50:26,338
I fold my hands.
Please don't disappoint me

1535
01:50:26,796 --> 01:50:29,674
-But...
-No buts sister. You have to say 'Yes'

1536
01:50:30,133 --> 01:50:31,468
[Ratna daughter! What's happening?]

1537
01:50:33,970 --> 01:50:36,848
Bhavani! What are you doing here?

1538
01:50:37,057 --> 01:50:38,225
What are you doing here?

1539
01:50:38,475 --> 01:50:41,478
I have asked the question first.
You answer.

1540
01:50:42,062 --> 01:50:44,356
-This is the house of my Son-in-law to be
-Really!

1541
01:50:44,772 --> 01:50:47,525
-So you've fixed Urmilla's marriage? With Laxman?
-yes

1542
01:50:47,942 --> 01:50:49,902
-NO No Noooo
-What happened?

1543
01:50:50,152 --> 01:50:52,446
-Not with Laxman. With Ram Prasad
-Oh!

1544
01:50:52,947 --> 01:50:53,906
-Answer me. Why are you here?
-Me?

1545
01:50:55,991 --> 01:50:57,326
-You know Kamala. Kamala
-Kamala??

1546
01:50:57,326 --> 01:51:00,538
I mean Bimla. Kamala, Bimla.
They both tie me 'Rakhees'

1547
01:51:00,538 --> 01:51:02,456
-She's my sister by name
-I see

1548
01:51:02,873 --> 01:51:06,418
Now I'm stuck. I don't know if I'm
on the grooms side or the bride's side

1549
01:51:07,169 --> 01:51:09,880
-No issues. You're both.
You eat the sweets on both sides

1550
01:51:11,549 --> 01:51:15,760
Ok brother. Tell me. When is the auspicious date?
We shouldn't delay in this work

1551
01:51:15,760 --> 01:51:18,471
Yes. I'll go now and get an auspicious date

1552
01:51:18,471 --> 01:51:23,017
Don't get up sister. Son, you stay here.
-Greetings  -Greetings

1553
01:51:23,726 --> 01:51:28,690
Kedar will see me off. Let's go Kedar
Greetings. Greetings

1554
01:51:28,690 --> 01:51:30,275
-Let's go Kedar
-Come. Come

1555
01:51:36,781 --> 01:51:40,660
-A new problem has started
-Once the marriage is done, all problems will be over

1556
01:51:40,660 --> 01:51:42,328
-You don't understand mother
-Why?

1557
01:51:42,328 --> 01:51:45,122
The problem is, the father likes Ram
and the daughter likes Lucky

1558
01:51:45,998 --> 01:51:50,294
Daughter doesn't want to see Ram's face
and seeing Laxman's face, father's blood pressure rises

1559
01:51:50,961 --> 01:51:53,422
-I'm stuck in the middle
-So, what will you do now?

1560
01:51:58,719 --> 01:52:00,512
There is only one way

1561
01:52:02,139 --> 01:52:05,100
For the sake of Ram,
Laxman will have to go into exile

1562
01:52:06,059 --> 01:52:09,521
Urmila, forget your Laxman

1563
01:52:10,522 --> 01:52:14,066
Your Laxman is leaving town forever and ever

1564
01:52:14,942 --> 01:52:19,572
[you marry brother. He'll keep you very very happy]

1565
01:52:19,989 --> 01:52:20,990
[more than I could]

1566
01:52:21,741 --> 01:52:24,035
Amazing! How did you hear this?

1567
01:52:24,452 --> 01:52:25,828
But you've heard the truth

1568
01:52:26,078 --> 01:52:27,455
The boy is pure gold

1569
01:52:28,581 --> 01:52:31,542
I had thought that God stopped making such boys

1570
01:52:32,460 --> 01:52:35,421
I went straight to his house
and fixed matters with his mother

1571
01:52:36,088 --> 01:52:36,672
Yes

1572
01:52:37,548 --> 01:52:39,926
Why not? Your daughter is like mine

1573
01:52:41,427 --> 01:52:43,595
Ok. Let's meet again. Goodnight

1574
01:52:44,262 --> 01:52:46,681
But I won't do this marriage, daddy

1575
01:52:48,892 --> 01:52:49,476
What did you say?

1576
01:52:49,851 --> 01:52:54,147
It's going to be my marriage, daddy.
And you didn't try to know my likes or dislikes

1577
01:52:54,147 --> 01:52:56,024
I didn't think it was necessary

1578
01:52:56,024 --> 01:52:59,444
-You don't know if your likes are right or not
-I have grown up now, daddy

1579
01:52:59,528 --> 01:53:03,240
-Even more grown up than me?
-But I hate your Ram Prasad, daddy. I hate him

1580
01:53:04,324 --> 01:53:08,161
Why don't you try to understand, daddy.
Maybe I like someone else

1581
01:53:10,288 --> 01:53:12,831
Oh! You think you are in love with someone?

1582
01:53:16,085 --> 01:53:17,169
Maybe with Laxman?

1583
01:53:20,965 --> 01:53:24,051
Your marriage won't be with one whom you love

1584
01:53:24,635 --> 01:53:28,681
Your marriage will be with one whom I love.
Meaning Ram Prasad

1585
01:53:29,390 --> 01:53:30,641
-Is there a compulsion?
-Yes!

1586
01:53:31,642 --> 01:53:35,437
You have forgotten the manners, prestige,
nobility and origins of your house

1587
01:53:36,105 --> 01:53:40,651
Without shame, seeing eye to eye,
you talk about your marriage to your father?

1588
01:53:41,485 --> 01:53:43,111
My love has spoilt you so much

1589
01:53:43,528 --> 01:53:46,739
Your marriage will be with Ram Prasad.
Go! Go! Go from here

1590
01:53:46,739 --> 01:53:49,325
I'm going. But I still hate Ram Prasad

1591

[Bell Rings]

1592
01:54:32,034 --> 01:54:32,826
Who's it?

1593
01:54:38,624 --> 01:54:39,291
Urmi!

1594
01:54:40,167 --> 01:54:41,125
You!

1595
01:54:41,792 --> 01:54:43,586
So late at night!

1596
01:54:44,879 --> 01:54:46,672
I've come to ask you

1597
01:54:47,673 --> 01:54:53,429
-How could you write that letter?
-What else could I do Urmi when your father likes brother?

1598
01:54:53,429 --> 01:54:55,014
What if father likes someone!!

1599
01:54:55,932 --> 01:54:58,809
You tell me. Whom do you like?

1600
01:55:01,646 --> 01:55:04,815
Do I have to tell whom I like?

1601
01:55:06,567 --> 01:55:07,318
Say

1602
01:55:09,695 --> 01:55:12,989
But Urmi, the depth with which I like you....

1603
01:55:14,324 --> 01:55:17,911
-Brother also likes you equally
-But I hate him! I hate him!

1604
01:55:18,703 --> 01:55:19,955
I hate him very much

1605
01:55:20,747 --> 01:55:24,918
-Speak softly! Brother will hear
-Let him hear. I don't fear anyone

1606
01:55:25,877 --> 01:55:27,546
I have left home for good

1607
01:55:27,838 --> 01:55:30,465
-Urmi!-
-Yes. I'm going to Pushpa's house

1608
01:55:31,174 --> 01:55:34,594
Tomorrow morning you'll come there,
take me to a temple and marry me

1609
01:55:35,387 --> 01:55:37,430
-Against your father's wishes?
-yes!

1610
01:55:37,973 --> 01:55:39,807
-I'll lose my job Urmi
-What?

1611
01:55:40,516 --> 01:55:44,687
-I mean my brother's...
-May your brother and his job go to hell

1612
01:55:45,104 --> 01:55:46,981
If you don't come tomorrow. Then I...

1613
01:55:47,690 --> 01:55:52,361
Then I'll commit suicide. Understood?
And the blame will be on you. Remember

1614
01:55:58,868 --> 01:56:04,790
-Let's go
-Urmi! Listen! Hear me out. Listen!

01:56:31,566 --> 01:56:34,903
-Is Ram Prasad there?
-Yes. Please come in. I'll call him

1618
01:56:34,903 --> 01:56:39,239
No. I'm alright here daughter. Please call him quickly
-Ok. Brother

1619
01:56:41,074 --> 01:56:43,994
-Who is it Ratna?
-Bhavani uncle is here, big brother

1620
01:56:43,994 --> 01:56:46,622
-Moustache?
-I'll put it on right now

1621

-He'll be a minute. You come inside..
-What is your other brother doing?

1622
01:56:50,584 --> 01:56:52,461
He..he isn't in

1623
01:56:53,879 --> 01:56:56,673
Those were my thoughts too.
When did he leave home?

1624
01:56:56,673 --> 01:56:57,925
He left in the morning

1625
01:56:58,383 --> 01:56:59,760
Did you see him leave?

1626
01:57:01,887 --> 01:57:04,389
-Was he home at night?
-yes. He was in at night

1627
01:57:04,973 --> 01:57:06,725
When did you last see him?

1628
01:57:07,809 --> 01:57:10,770
Around 10 to 10:30.
what's the matter uncle?

1629
01:57:11,395 --> 01:57:14,482
-Nothing daughter. Go. Send Ram Prasad quickly
-Ok

1630
01:57:19,695 --> 01:57:22,365
He looks very serious. He didn't come inside too.

1631
01:57:22,365 --> 01:57:25,368
He's cross examining about Laxman like a lawyer

1632
01:57:25,910 --> 01:57:28,496
Looks like, very soon a new Ramayan will be written

1633
01:57:28,955 --> 01:57:31,290
By Laxman's hands, Ram will be slain

1634
01:57:35,628 --> 01:57:37,921
What's this sir? You are standing here?
Please come inside

1635
01:57:37,921 --> 01:57:41,716
You come outside. I want to talk to you in private

1636
01:57:46,888 --> 01:57:48,056
Yes. Sir?

1637
01:57:48,807 --> 01:57:52,853
-Your brother Laxman isn't at home?
-No sir but what happened?

1638
01:57:53,353 --> 01:57:56,398
-With his help my daughter has run away from home
-No No Sir

1639
01:57:56,773 --> 01:57:59,192
Yes Ram Prasad.
I'm going to inform the police

1640
01:57:59,192 --> 01:58:02,279
Please don't do that sir.
All secrets will be out.

1641
01:58:02,279 --> 01:58:03,196
What secrets will be out?

1642
01:58:03,196 --> 01:58:07,366
-If the police start asking questions,
I'll be left nowhere. I'll get trapped sir.
-How will you get trapped?

1643
01:58:08,159 --> 01:58:13,664
What I mean is, if Laxman becomes infamours,
how will I marry off my sister?

1644
01:58:13,664 --> 01:58:20,796
And sir, I can say with certainity that Laxman had
no part in your daughter running away from home

1645
01:58:20,796 --> 01:58:22,173
How can you be so certain?

1646
01:58:22,173 --> 01:58:26,760
After all, what's the difference between us?
We are twin brothers

1647
01:58:26,760 --> 01:58:29,430
If your brother is innocent
then why are you worried?

1648
01:58:29,430 --> 01:58:31,724
-I'm going to inform the police
-No no Sir. Please!

1649
01:58:31,724 --> 01:58:36,686
Please Sir. Give me 3 hours and I'll bring
Miss Urmila to your house

01:58:36,686 --> 01:58:38,813
How? You know where she is?

1651
01:58:38,813 --> 01:58:45,278
No no sir. But I know Laxman's hangouts.
And if Laxman knows anything, then..

1652
01:58:45,278 --> 01:58:49,199
Ok. Ok. But after 3 hours,
I'll inform the police

1653
01:59:04,589 --> 01:59:05,423
You?

1654
01:59:06,465 --> 01:59:10,552
-Urmi has called me
-Oh! Please come in

1655
01:59:14,681 --> 01:59:15,307
Please come

1656
01:59:20,938 --> 01:59:23,440
Please come. Go on upstairs

1657
01:59:42,959 --> 01:59:43,668
Urmi!

1658
01:59:49,173 --> 01:59:51,342
-What were you eating?
-Poison. Not your business

1659
01:59:51,342 --> 01:59:53,052
-Urmi!
-Don't call me Urmi

1660
01:59:53,469 --> 01:59:56,180
- OK. I won't call you. But listen to me
-What do you want to say?

1661
01:59:56,180 --> 02:00:00,476
See. Nothing can be done in anger.
You need to think with a cool head, Urmi.

1662
02:00:00,476 --> 02:00:01,978
-How dare you touch?
-Urmi!

1663
02:00:01,978 --> 02:00:03,145
-Again Urmi?
-Listen

1664
02:00:03,145 --> 02:00:04,397
-Don't come forward
-Atleast listen

1665
02:00:04,397 --> 02:00:07,732
-But why are you venting your father's anger on me
-Just get out from here
-Listen!

1666
02:00:08,233 --> 02:00:10,569
Did I refuse to marry?

1667
02:00:11,069 --> 02:00:13,321
-what?
-That's what I've come to say

1668
02:00:14,281 --> 02:00:16,700
-Oh! so, you came to tell me that?
-yes!

1669
02:00:16,700 --> 02:00:19,786
You skunk! Ever seen your face
in the mirror? Just get out from here

1670
02:00:19,786 --> 02:00:21,997
-I don't want to talk to you. Get out of here
-But Urmi

1671
02:00:22,622 --> 02:00:26,793
-You scoundrel, you scoundrel, you rascal, you you
-You..you..what are you doing?

1672
02:00:26,793 --> 02:00:33,717
-you..you..You get out from here..get out..
-Listen to me..what's happened to you..

1673
02:00:44,059 --> 02:00:46,479
-So, you hate me?
-yes

1674
02:00:47,188 --> 02:00:48,772
-You don't want to see my face?
-yes!

1675
02:00:49,690 --> 02:00:57,114
Ok. I'll go away forever. But once.
For the last time, look at me. Please

1676
02:01:07,790 --> 02:01:09,250
-Ok, I'm leaving
-Lucky?

1677
02:01:09,792 --> 02:01:14,088
-No, I'm not lucky. I'm stupid.
-You are stupid

1678
02:01:14,672 --> 02:01:15,924
But you are mine

1679
02:01:18,009 --> 02:01:22,972
Bhavani, what is this foolishness?
I'm your friend. Trust in me

1680
02:01:23,473 --> 02:01:25,558
Urmilla also means something to me

1681
02:01:26,100 --> 02:01:27,936
Your honour is my honour

1682
02:01:28,645 --> 02:01:32,357
If increasing your blood pressure
will solve this, then do it with glee

1683
02:01:32,607 --> 02:01:35,442
If I don't increase my blood pressure,
should I beat the drum with this thought that

1684
02:01:35,442 --> 02:01:40,739
your favourite, ruffina, loafer, moustache-less nephew
has run away with my innocent daughter?

1685
02:01:41,114 --> 02:01:44,660
Then shout a lot!... Scream a lot!
There is Laxman's gain in it

1686
02:01:45,244 --> 02:01:47,079
-Laxman's gain?
-Yes
-How's that?

1687
02:01:47,830 --> 02:01:53,752
Brother, if your blood pressure rises,
you'll have cerebral haemorrhage

1688
02:01:53,752 --> 02:01:56,088
And if you have cerebral haemorrhage,
you will die

1689
02:01:56,088 --> 02:02:00,968
And when you die, Your wealth will go to Urmilla.
To Laxman..Shout!....Shout!

1690
02:02:01,552 --> 02:02:05,763
-Then I won't shout
-Bhavani, I know Laxman very well

1691
02:02:05,763 --> 02:02:10,476
-He is naughty but he isn't a vagabond or hooligan
-yes, he is!

1692
02:02:11,144 --> 02:02:12,061
You're shouting again?

1693
02:02:12,395 --> 02:02:18,234
He is. He is a vagabond, hooligan, ruffian, loafer

1694
02:02:27,160 --> 02:02:33,415
-Kedar. I want to speak to Urmilla in private
-Ok Ok. Ram let's go

1695
02:02:39,337 --> 02:02:41,256
Do just like I told you

1696
02:02:42,883 --> 02:02:43,925
Go

1697
02:02:44,634 --> 02:02:45,010
Let's go

1698
02:03:02,526 --> 02:03:03,819
I'm very sorry daddy.

1699
02:03:04,570 --> 02:03:05,863
Please forgive me

1700
02:03:08,949 --> 02:03:11,035
You spoke the truth daddy

1701
02:03:11,535 --> 02:03:15,039
A man without moustache can't be noble

1702
02:03:15,581 --> 02:03:18,334
Laxman. Laxman turned out to be a no. 1 laofer

1703
02:03:18,334 --> 02:03:20,085
What's the use of repenting now?

1704
02:03:20,544 --> 02:03:25,674
What all programs I had made. I found a boy
like Ram for you and you spoilt everything

1705
02:03:25,716 --> 02:03:27,218
Nothing has gone wrong daddy

1706
02:03:29,720 --> 02:03:32,180
Mr. Ram has..Mr. Ram has forgiven me

1707
02:03:32,806 --> 02:03:35,642
And he also said that he...

1708
02:03:36,184 --> 02:03:38,436
he still...still...

1709
02:03:38,937 --> 02:03:39,771
still what?

1710
02:03:42,732 --> 02:03:44,317
he still....

1711
02:03:46,486 --> 02:03:48,905
doesn't have any objections in marrying me

1712
02:03:51,074 --> 02:03:53,993
-this!..Ram Prasad said this?
-Yes

1713
02:03:57,455 --> 02:03:59,040
Blessed Ram Prasad

1714
02:04:00,458 --> 02:04:04,878
Father used to say that
"we shouldn't dwell on small mistakes"

1715
02:04:05,712 --> 02:04:10,259
"A human should strive to look
into the soul of a human"

1716
02:04:10,592 --> 02:04:13,428
"Because the most important thing is
Cleaness of Heart"

1717
02:04:13,846 --> 02:04:16,056
Yes! Brother used to speak the truth

1718
02:04:16,682 --> 02:04:22,771
Look at today's people. Busy with cleaning moustache
and beard. No attention towards cleaning the heart

1719
02:04:24,148 --> 02:04:28,986
Yes. I also can't understand why these days
people keep shaving their moustache

1720
02:04:37,160 --> 02:04:38,619
Kalindi!

1721
02:04:40,955 --> 02:04:42,039
What is it brother?

1722
02:04:43,332 --> 02:04:45,376
Bring Ram Prasad some bread

1723
02:04:45,376 --> 02:04:49,922
-No Sir.It's a lot
-No. Its not a lot yet. A lot will happen now son.

1724
02:04:50,548 --> 02:04:52,592
Eat. Eat. Eat your fill

1725
02:04:53,092 --> 02:04:56,012
-Today is the last day to eat
-What?

1726
02:04:56,387 --> 02:04:59,724
I mean, before marriage you're eating
for the last time today

1727
02:04:59,724 --> 02:05:05,562
Why are you standing here listening? Bring food.
Eat son. Eat. I'll be right back

1728
02:05:08,440 --> 02:05:10,066
-Shall I bring 'potato paratha'?
-no no

1729
02:05:10,317 --> 02:05:16,781
Why no? Your uncle also used to say no
but in the end she used to eat 4 persons food

1730
02:05:21,745 --> 02:05:24,039
Hello. Police?

1731
02:05:27,542 --> 02:05:28,877
Oh! no no. This is too much

1732
02:05:28,877 --> 02:05:34,298
How is this too much? This much paratha
was enough just to warm up your uncle's teeth

1733
02:05:34,298 --> 02:05:40,429
He always says "Kalindi, you talk too much
and eat too little"

1734
02:05:40,846 --> 02:05:44,517
But son, I couldn't fulfill one of his wishes

1735
02:05:45,017 --> 02:05:48,354
-But I'll fulfill it after your marriage
-what's that aunty?

1736
02:05:48,562 --> 02:05:55,820
He loved to eat 'Radish Mughlai Paratha'. One day,
with great effort, I read a book and made some for him

1737
02:05:56,612 --> 02:05:59,948
But after eating the first Paratha,
he passed away at the dining table itself

1738
02:06:00,573 --> 02:06:04,869
Son, after your marriage, I'll make the
same 'Radish paratha' for you. Ok?

1739
02:06:05,620 --> 02:06:09,207
No aunty. Don't feed me 'Radish paratha',
feed me 'Potato paratha' only

1740
02:06:09,874 --> 02:06:12,502
Why only 'Potato paratha' son?

1741
02:06:13,086 --> 02:06:17,507
I'll feed you Calcutta's 'Royal Bhog'

1742
02:06:18,341 --> 02:06:20,969
Delhi's 'Golden Halwa'!

1743
02:06:21,469 --> 02:06:22,762
'Peda' from Madras!

1744
02:06:23,721 --> 02:06:27,475
-From Benaras..Benaras
-Kalakan!
-I'll feed you Kalakan

1745
02:06:27,934 --> 02:06:29,893
But sir, so many sweets?

1746
02:06:29,893 --> 02:06:34,314
Son, if you don't eat, how will you get strength?

1747
02:06:34,314 --> 02:06:40,445
And if you don't have strength,
how will you bear the police beatings, son?

1748
02:06:41,113 --> 02:06:44,867
-Police beating?
-Yes, police beating

1749
02:06:47,286 --> 02:06:50,289
You cheat! you fraud!

1750
02:06:50,789 --> 02:06:55,794
Sir...you...you please forgive me sir.

1751
02:06:55,794 --> 02:06:56,837
Forgive?

1752
02:06:58,921 --> 02:07:03,634
Not forgive. I will clean you.
Police must be on their way

1753
02:07:04,969 --> 02:07:05,845
Sir, I....

1754
02:07:06,345 --> 02:07:11,100
No! Beware! Beware!
I'll shoot you if you try to escape

1755
02:07:12,018 --> 02:07:14,937
-Hey Kalindi. Guard the door. Don't let him escape
-ok

1756
02:07:15,354 --> 02:07:16,481
No sir. I....

1757
02:07:17,190 --> 02:07:22,236
I won't escape. You informed the police.
You did very well.

1758
02:07:22,987 --> 02:07:25,281
-I deserve to go to jail
-Yes!

1759
02:07:25,907 --> 02:07:32,037
I have done many sins.
Let me repent for my sins, sir.

1760
02:07:33,789 --> 02:07:35,207
Let me touch your feet

1761
02:07:35,499 --> 02:07:38,668
Beware! No feet business! No feet business

1762
02:07:42,672 --> 02:07:47,302
Aunty? Atleast you let me touch your feet.

1763
02:07:52,766 --> 02:07:57,144
He escaped..he escaped...catch him...catch him

1764
02:07:57,520 --> 02:07:59,188
Move away from my front!

1765
02:08:05,444 --> 02:08:05,986
Who?

1766
02:08:08,239 --> 02:08:09,824
-You!
-Shhhhhh

1767
02:08:10,157 --> 02:08:13,035
-Your moustache?
-It went into your daddy's hands

1768
02:08:13,035 --> 02:08:16,539
Spirit gum was less. Bugger came off
infront of him. I got caught

1769
02:08:17,540 --> 02:08:19,041
What about our marriage now?

1770
02:08:22,419 --> 02:08:22,837
Urmi

1771
02:08:24,130 --> 02:08:26,464
[Urmi ! Urmi !]
-Don't open the door. Don't open the door

1772
02:08:26,923 --> 02:08:30,844
[Urmi open the door. Urmi !]
No no. I am changing my clothes daddy

1773
02:08:31,219 --> 02:08:33,346
-I'm changing my clothes daddy
-No no. Say it loudly

1774
02:08:33,805 --> 02:08:35,223
I'm changing my clothes daddy

1775
02:08:35,723 --> 02:08:39,435
Ok keep the door closed.
A big criminal is in the house today.

1776
02:08:39,435 --> 02:08:40,979
Today he won't escape my hands

1777
02:08:41,604 --> 02:08:43,481
-Kalindi. You see this side. I'll see upstairs
-Ok brother

1778
02:08:45,191 --> 02:08:46,818
-Go!
-I'm going. I'm going

1779
02:08:57,536 --> 02:09:00,205
-What will happen now?
-Now I'll have to go to jail

1780
02:09:02,708 --> 02:09:03,834
There is a way

1781
02:09:04,209 --> 02:09:07,004
If we get out from here and get married
then daddy won't... his son-in-law

1782
02:09:07,004 --> 02:09:08,380
But how will we get out of here?

1783
02:09:08,380 --> 02:09:10,007
Over there, the demon is standing with a pistol

1784
02:09:10,340 --> 02:09:11,300
-Demon, who?
-Your daddy

1785
02:09:11,300 --> 02:09:15,929
-You called my daddy!!...
-No no. Over there, the angel is waiting to
welcome me with a pistol

1786
02:09:15,929 --> 02:09:17,681
Now tell me how we get out of here

1787
02:09:18,223 --> 02:09:19,808
How to get out of here...

1788
02:09:28,399 --> 02:09:29,484
-Tarzan
-Meaning what?

1789
02:09:29,484 --> 02:09:31,527
-You have a rope, right?
-No

1790
02:09:34,822 --> 02:09:38,367
-Give me 2/4 bedcovers, shawls,whatever, quickly!
-Understood

1791
02:09:39,911 --> 02:09:43,331
-Listen, I'll go out and start the car.
You meet me there.
-Ok

1792
02:09:44,624 --> 02:09:48,419
-Listen. You won't fall, right?
-No. Go!!

1793
02:09:49,629 --> 02:09:50,254
Listen

1794
02:09:51,672 --> 02:09:52,256
Nothing

1795
02:10:30,960 --> 02:10:33,170
KALINDI #$% !! What are you doing here?

1796
02:10:33,420 --> 02:10:36,590
-Brother, I thought..
-Thought! You started thinking too!

1797
02:10:37,299 --> 02:10:40,594
Go see there! I'll see here.
Where will he run?

1798
02:10:55,525 --> 02:10:56,109
Hands Up!

1799
02:11:22,051 --> 02:11:23,261
Why you thief!

1800
02:11:23,261 --> 02:11:27,222
-Wait for the fun. brother...brother..
-Aunty...aunty..aunty

1801
02:11:27,764 --> 02:11:30,976
-He's getting away brother..brother..come quickly..
-Aunty..aunty..don't hit me so hard..aunty

1802
02:11:32,060 --> 02:11:35,314
-Take that...brother...
-Aunty...aunty...

1803
02:11:38,275 --> 02:11:44,990
Brother..brother..come quickly..brother...
Get down...Get down

1804
02:11:46,867 --> 02:11:48,994
Brother..brother..brother..

1805
02:11:48,994 --> 02:11:50,120
What happened? ..what happened?
-brother..brother,brother,brother

1806
02:11:51,246 --> 02:11:56,083
-Brother, he ran away
-where? where?
-this way. this way

1807
02:11:57,084 --> 02:11:59,587
thief..thief...

1808
02:12:19,899 --> 02:12:22,692
[Topsy turvey, brother

1809
02:12:25,195 --> 02:12:27,405
[Topsy turvy, brother
all is topsy turvy]

1810
02:12:29,783 --> 02:12:32,452
[Topsy turvy, brother
all is topsy turvy]

1811
02:12:34,746 --> 02:12:44,256
[Every straight path has a curved way]

[Topsy turvy,brother

-Sir?
-Put him in the lockup

1816
02:14:18,305 --> 02:14:19,598
Walk..Go inside and sit.

1817
02:14:19,598 --> 02:14:24,310
[-what? don't you people have other work]
-keep quiet. This is a police station
-This is the limit]

1818
02:14:24,977 --> 02:14:26,020
Who is shouting there?

1819
02:14:27,271 --> 02:14:28,356
[It's sir's voice]
O let me go. Sir

1820
02:14:29,190 --> 02:14:30,650
Sir. Morning Sir.

1821
02:14:30,650 --> 02:14:31,943
-You got caught again?
-Yes

1822
02:14:31,943 --> 02:14:34,821
-Where did you find him?
-His liquor shop is behind the nearby house, sir

1823
02:14:35,404 --> 02:14:38,074
-When will you quit this business?
-Whenever you say, I'll quit

1824
02:14:38,491 --> 02:14:41,661
Sit there quietly.
I'll meet the big sir and come back

1825
02:14:49,836 --> 02:14:51,419
-Hey! Up! Up!
-what happened?

1826
02:14:51,419 --> 02:14:52,754
Get up from here. Sit over there

1827
02:14:52,754 --> 02:14:57,676
-Going, going. Going brother. Why touch me?..
You do your own work

1828
02:15:01,847 --> 02:15:04,224
Hey! Smoking sir's cigarette! Go!

1829
02:15:04,224 --> 02:15:07,310
-Don't touch.
-Go!...get lost....go...

1830
02:15:07,978 --> 02:15:15,068
-Go! Go!
-I'll draw your card. Card..Card...I'll draw it

1831
02:15:16,319 --> 02:15:17,112
Hooligan!

1832
02:15:21,073 --> 02:15:22,366
Sit here. Sir will be here shortly

1833
02:15:25,995 --> 02:15:28,205
Hey! Put your leg down

02:15:29,373 --> 02:15:31,333
-Put your leg down!
-Who's it?

1835
02:15:32,585 --> 02:15:34,295
Inspector sir, you've come?

1836
02:15:34,295 --> 02:15:36,172
-I'm not an inspector
-not an inspector?

1837
02:15:36,797 --> 02:15:39,341
Then you must be a thief, petty thief,
hooligan or vagabond

1838
02:15:39,341 --> 02:15:40,176
NO!

1839
02:15:40,551 --> 02:15:45,639
What! This is a police station.
So, there will be the police or thief, petty thief,
hooligan and vagabond

1840
02:15:46,056 --> 02:15:48,058
-Will there be a great soul here?
-No!

1841
02:15:48,768 --> 02:15:50,477
-I'm a businessman
-businessman?

1842
02:15:51,019 --> 02:15:52,270
Then I'm also a businessman

1843
02:15:53,646 --> 02:15:54,689
Glad to meet you

1844
02:15:55,315 --> 02:15:59,903
No! You're a businessman and so am I.
Looks like we both have the same business.

1845
02:16:00,570 --> 02:16:01,738
Where is your liquor shop?

1846
02:16:04,866 --> 02:16:07,202
Hey! Why keep throwing bombs?
My drunkenness will be over

1847
02:16:07,577 --> 02:16:08,369
Will you keep quiet or not?

1848
02:16:08,369 --> 02:16:11,998
Ah! Its good..understood...understood..

1849
02:16:12,874 --> 02:16:14,417
Understood brother

1850
02:16:14,417 --> 02:16:17,504
Its the first time you've been caught
so you are nervous

1851
02:16:18,879 --> 02:16:21,215
Brother, there is no need to worry

1852
02:16:21,215 --> 02:16:24,301
I have the medicine for it.
I'll give it to you

1853
02:16:27,805 --> 02:16:30,349
Look that way. Look that way. Look that way

1854
02:16:35,646 --> 02:16:38,982
Brother. Its from the first batch.
Take two gulps

1855
02:16:38,982 --> 02:16:41,902
You'll have a lot of fun.
All nervousness will go away

1856
02:16:41,902 --> 02:16:43,487
Drink, drink. Drink and see.

1857
02:16:45,155 --> 02:16:45,781
What have you done?

1858
02:16:47,616 --> 02:16:51,119
You insulted alcohol!
And its your livelihood. Unfaithful!

1859
02:16:51,619 --> 02:16:53,955
-Shut up!
-Hey, be silent. Big officer is coming

1860
02:16:57,750 --> 02:16:59,710
-What is this?
-Greetings, big officer. Greetings

1861
02:16:59,710 --> 02:17:01,546
Why have you become thin sir?

1862
02:17:01,546 --> 02:17:03,548
You will never straighten up

1863
02:17:03,548 --> 02:17:05,842
Sir. What's my fault sir?

1864
02:17:05,842 --> 02:17:10,012
The Municipality said, Jaundice is on the rise,
drink water after boiling

1865
02:17:10,012 --> 02:17:13,099
That's why people stopped drinking water
and my business flourished

1866
02:17:13,891 --> 02:17:16,978
There are some people, sir,
who neither drink liquor nor water

1867
02:17:17,561 --> 02:17:19,354
They drink something else.
Let it go sir. [sniggers]

1868
02:17:19,980 --> 02:17:21,106
What a joke sir! [sniggers]

1869
02:17:21,523 --> 02:17:23,859
-Constable
-Yes sir
-Put him in the lockup

1870
02:17:23,859 --> 02:17:27,112
Wait a minute. Sir he's my friend.
He got caught for the first time

1871
02:17:27,112 --> 02:17:29,364
Please give him less punishment.
Greetings sir.

1872
02:17:29,364 --> 02:17:30,699
Take him away. Take him away

1873
02:17:31,992 --> 02:17:33,702
Ok brother. Tata, tata, bye bye

1874
02:17:37,539 --> 02:17:38,832
Why has he been brought here?

1875
02:17:38,832 --> 02:17:42,210
Rash driving sir. Hit a police jeep.
A revolver was also found on him

1876
02:17:43,420 --> 02:17:44,254
Revolver?

1877
02:17:44,921 --> 02:17:45,630
I have license

1878
02:17:47,590 --> 02:17:48,132
Show it

1879
02:17:48,883 --> 02:17:49,550
It's at home

1880
02:17:52,011 --> 02:17:53,137
What did you find in the car?

1881
02:17:53,137 --> 02:17:53,929
Nothing sir

1882
02:17:55,264 --> 02:17:57,600
It means he was running away
after dumping the goods

1883
02:17:58,267 --> 02:18:00,686
What were you smuggling?
Whose goods were those?

1884
02:18:01,103 --> 02:18:05,357
What do you mean "whose goods were those"?
Do I look like a smuggler, moustache-less!

1885
02:18:06,942 --> 02:18:09,236
-Do you start drinking from morning?
-I don't drink alcohol

1886
02:18:09,236 --> 02:18:10,946
That drunkard spilt it on me

1887
02:18:10,946 --> 02:18:14,909
But officer, officer. You car was parked to
the wrong side. It was not my fault

1888
02:18:14,909 --> 02:18:16,743
It is obvious that you don't know me

1889
02:18:19,037 --> 02:18:20,663
This one speaks english

1890
02:18:32,133 --> 02:18:35,261
Now I know you.
Welcome home. Welcome home

1891
02:18:35,261 --> 02:18:43,019
Famous bandit, dacoit, murderer,  smuggler,
cheat, Mr. Pascal DeCosta

1892
02:18:43,353 --> 02:18:44,187
-Pascal?
-yes

1893
02:18:44,187 --> 02:18:46,772
-If I'm Pascal, you are Rascal
-Shut Up!

1894
02:18:47,648 --> 02:18:49,942
You're tricking us with your false moustache?

1895
02:18:49,942 --> 02:18:52,319
-Constable
-Yes Sir
-Remove his moustache

1896
02:18:53,153 --> 02:18:54,613
Beware! Beware!

1897
02:18:58,158 --> 02:19:00,619
-What happened? What happened?
-Sir, his moustache is real

1898
02:19:00,619 --> 02:19:03,831
-moustache is real?
-you attacked my moustache!

1899
02:19:03,831 --> 02:19:05,707
I won't let go off you

1900
02:19:06,291 --> 02:19:09,002
I'll go to the High Court
I'll go to the Supreme Court

1901
02:19:09,002 --> 02:19:12,589
I'll raise it in the Parliament,
you bloody buffon!

1902
02:19:13,132 --> 02:19:17,009
Hey Mr. Pascal. Don't forget that
I'm a police officer

1903
02:19:17,427 --> 02:19:18,719
-You are a police officer?
-Yes

1904
02:19:19,554 --> 02:19:21,556
You're not a police officer,
you're a foolish officer

1905
02:19:21,556 --> 02:19:25,435
F.O.O.L.I.S. H. Foolish meaning Idiot

1906
02:19:25,435 --> 02:19:27,228
-Shut Up!
-Come On!

1907
02:19:33,526 --> 02:19:35,236
Mr. Bhavani Shankar ! you here?

1908
02:19:35,236 --> 02:19:38,948
-Mr. Bhavani Shanka?
-Yes sir, He is a very big industrialist

1909
02:19:38,948 --> 02:19:40,783
-Are you sure?
-Of course, sir.

1910
02:19:41,909 --> 02:19:42,744
Oh God!

1911
02:19:44,620 --> 02:19:46,830
Please pardon me. It's not my fault.

1912
02:19:46,830 --> 02:19:49,750
Have a look at this photo.
It looks like your twin brother

1913
02:19:51,251 --> 02:19:56,965
Officer, you can beat me, imprison me, hang me
But don't say the word 'twin' infront of me

1914
02:19:58,258 --> 02:19:59,885
Ok sir. I won't say

1915
02:20:01,136 --> 02:20:02,053
Do you want to drink something cold?

1916
02:20:04,222 --> 02:20:05,390
Do you want to go home?

1917
02:20:07,225 --> 02:20:10,479
-Sharma, take him home
-Yes sir. Please come

1918
02:20:21,530 --> 02:20:22,323
Thank you

1919
02:20:23,449 --> 02:20:24,700
You are welcome sir

1920
02:20:29,288 --> 02:20:31,540
-Constable, bring me my moustache
-what?

1921
02:20:32,333 --> 02:20:34,543
-Oh brother! Bring me something cold. Cold!

1922
02:20:34,919 --> 02:20:35,419
Ok Sir

1923
02:20:55,814 --> 02:20:59,150
-You've come back brother? Congratulations
-Congratulations for what?

1924
02:20:59,526 --> 02:21:01,111
-Urmilla got married
-Very good

1925
02:21:01,569 --> 02:21:02,779
WHAT? With whom?

1926
02:21:03,363 --> 02:21:04,489
with Laxman

1927
02:21:04,989 --> 02:21:06,157
This marriage can never happen

1928
02:21:06,157 --> 02:21:08,785
But the marriage is done brother
they've already circled the fire

1929
02:21:08,785 --> 02:21:11,204
I'll make them go anti-circles, anti-circles

1930
02:21:12,205 --> 02:21:15,499
A Hindu marriage can't be
broken so easily, brother

1931
02:21:15,499 --> 02:21:16,875
Mrs. Srivastava. You?

1932
02:21:17,459 --> 02:21:19,837
You can call me Mrs Srivastava
and Mrs Sharma too

1933
02:21:19,878 --> 02:21:20,504
I didn't understand

1934
02:21:21,422 --> 02:21:22,339
I'll explain

1935
02:21:23,215 --> 02:21:26,593
First tell me Bhavani
Why are you so angry on Laxman?

1936
02:21:26,593 --> 02:21:29,179
Only because he doesn't have a moustache?
-Only !!

1937
02:21:29,888 --> 02:21:33,600
For one who chopped his moustache,how long
would it have taken him to chop his brother's neck?

1938
02:21:33,809 --> 02:21:34,685
-Huh?
-Yes

1939
02:21:35,144 --> 02:21:39,064
Yes, Laxman has killed his brother Ram
Do you understand murder?

1940
02:21:39,064 --> 02:21:42,109
He came here wearing a moustache
so that in the guise of Ram I..

1941
02:21:42,109 --> 02:21:45,194
-Listen to me
-No! I won't listen to any of you now

1942
02:21:45,611 --> 02:21:49,866
You are correct! You're speaking the truth.
Don't listen to anyone. Just listen to me

1943
02:21:50,283 --> 02:21:52,452
Lo! one more moustache-less has arrived.
Who are you brother?

1944
02:21:52,910 --> 02:21:55,121
-I'm Prasad's friend
-Which Prasad?

1945
02:21:55,538 --> 02:21:57,582
-you can say Ram Prasad or Laxman Prasad
-Beware!

1946
02:21:57,957 --> 02:21:59,584
Don't take the name of Laxman Prasad
in front of me

1947
02:22:00,126 --> 02:22:02,211
Sir..Sir..Sir..
Please think

1948
02:22:02,211 --> 02:22:05,465
If for some reason you have to shave your moustache

1949
02:22:05,465 --> 02:22:08,801
Will you change from Bhavani Shankar
to Poppat Lal?

1950
02:22:09,552 --> 02:22:11,596
You won't become, right?
Just look towards the world

1951
02:22:11,596 --> 02:22:16,183
Jawaharlal Nehru, Mao Tse Tung, President Kennedy.
Did they have moustaches?

1952
02:22:16,183 --> 02:22:18,059
No. Were they great men?
Yes!

1953
02:22:18,059 --> 02:22:19,269
And look at the other side

1954
02:22:19,269 --> 02:22:25,942
A small Hitler with a small toothbrush like moustache.
And how big was the destruction of his mind?

1955
02:22:26,610 --> 02:22:31,573
Bhavani. Is nobility a bird which
makes its nest in a moustache?

1956
02:22:31,573 --> 02:22:32,324
Meaning what?

1957
02:22:32,324 --> 02:22:35,452
Meaning you saw Ram watching hockey

1958
02:22:36,119 --> 02:22:38,747
Then to save his job,
he had to lie to you

1959
02:22:39,164 --> 02:22:41,291
He had to play the act of a twin brother.
Even Kamala had to.

1960
02:22:41,291 --> 02:22:43,167
And you didn't even find out

1961
02:22:45,377 --> 02:22:46,504
Oh No!

1962
02:22:49,590 --> 02:22:51,008
Come son. Come. Come

1963
02:22:52,802 --> 02:22:54,804
Bhavani. Give them blessings.

1964
02:22:56,931 --> 02:22:57,556
Hey! Go. go.

1965
02:23:02,853 --> 02:23:04,563
Please forgive me sir

1966
02:23:05,231 --> 02:23:09,777
Hey! not sir. He's your father-in-law.
Say father. Father!

1967
02:23:11,361 --> 02:23:14,030
Please forgive me....Father

1968
02:23:14,030 --> 02:23:14,489
Daddy

1969
02:23:14,489 --> 02:23:14,989
Brother

1970
02:23:14,989 --> 02:23:15,782
Uncle

1971
02:23:15,782 --> 02:23:16,533
Uncle

1972
02:23:16,533 --> 02:23:17,242
