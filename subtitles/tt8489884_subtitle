00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:12,125
Hello brother..

3
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,041
...what happened with your bike?

4
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:15,666
Checking what happened?

5
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:18,875
You! You are a Lady!

6
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:20,583
Why? Any problem?

7
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:25,000
Hello, it's alright, Thank you.

8
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:26,041
I will check it...

9
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:26,916
...It won't be a problem.

10
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:34,541
Have you checked the plug?

11
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:35,875
Yes...

12
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,875
...but it seems that it needs
to take to the garage.

13
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:39,458
Garage?

14
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:42,458
Where will you get a garage here?

15
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:43,625
No, no...

16
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,375
...you have to walk for an hour.

17
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:51,416
What a mess in this rainy weather!

18
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:53,458
Rather do one thing...

19
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:58,125
...come with me in my bike.

20
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:01,916
Let's go and get some mechanic...

21
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:02,791
...please come.

22
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,291
You please leave...

23
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:06,583
...need not to worry about me.

24
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:12,000
Hey, are you scared about me?

25
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:13,750
No, no...

26
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:15,666
...nothing to worry darling...

27
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:17,082
...nothing to worry.

28
00:04:17,124 --> 00:04:18,499
Within five minutes...

29
00:04:19,249 --> 00:04:21,874
...I will solve all your problems.

30
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:22,791
Come to me.

31
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:50,041
(THE SACRED TEARS)

32
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:02,457
Namita!

33
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:04,166
Here I am.

34
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:06,333
What's up?

35
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,916
Have you made my tea?
- Yes, it's almost done.

36
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:10,875
After my tea, give Ronit's breakfast...

37
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:12,916
...have you served the milk
to Ronit's father?

38
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:15,833
Mam,
sir was asking for some “Luchi” today.

39
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:17,458
Never give it.

40
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:19,458
Can't even digest water...

41
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,250
...asking for “Luchi”! Huh?

42
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:25,666
Mam, your cellphone was ringing
at upstairs since for a long time.

43
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:26,958
You need not to worry about it...

44
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,875
...I heard it

45
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:30,208
Just do what I told.

46
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:51,291
Yes, tell me.

47
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:54,000
I was trying so long time...

48
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:56,541
...was quiet tensed.
- Why?

49
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:57,833
Why not?

50
00:05:57,875 --> 00:05:59,125
Yesterday night you came alone...

51
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:00,916
...along with so much hard cash.

52
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:02,250
Now tell me...

53
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:04,625
...have you got that land?

54
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:06,125
No Harababu.

55
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:08,166
It's very difficult to get it.

56
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,625
That person is very fishy.

57
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:14,000
Realized our needs, he is
asking for a huge price.

58
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:17,416
I was thinking...

59
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:20,125
...to buy a revolver.

60
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:21,458
Why!

61
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:22,582
For what?

62
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:24,207
What to do with revolver?

63
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,666
To punish those rouges...

64
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:26,625
...what else.

65
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:27,625
Huh!

66
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:31,125
After seeing any lady,
those scoundrels just start licking.

67
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:33,166
You know Harababu,

68
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:35,083
what happened yesterday night
while I was returning?

69
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:36,375
What happened?

70
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:37,583
Oh

71
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:39,750
Ok. Is it!

72
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:40,916
No, no, Tamasha...

73
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:42,625
...revolver is not required.

74
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:44,666
Rather I will arrange a boy...

75
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:47,333
...at your house for 24 hours
within today or tomorrow.

76
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:49,375
Very efficient guy...

77
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:51,332
...whatever I will say
he will do that.

78
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:55,458
Listen, after all you are my 50% Partner
in business Tamasha.

79
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:57,333
Keep faith on me...

80
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,375
...will never loose.

81
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:01,541
The full responsibility of
your security is mine.

82
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:03,875
I will send the boy within tomorrow...

83
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:06,250
...and listen we do not
need that land...

84
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:08,916
...will get some other land for
the Petrol Pump.

85
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,750
Today, shall I come at noon?

86
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:15,166
No, never!

87
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:18,875
Harababu
today is 15th August!...

88
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:20,500
...have you forgotten?

89
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:21,541
Ronit has no school...

90
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:24,207
and Ronit's father is
also going to stay full day at home.

91
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,500
Huh, leave...

92
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
...Ronit's father.

93
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:30,207
You?

94
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:34,082
What are you doing here?

95
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:36,500
Go...

96
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:38,791
...go and take rest.

97
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:45,708
What happened?

98
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:47,582
Hello, hello...

99
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:49,832
Tamasha...
I'm saying...

100
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:51,083
Today it is not possible...

101
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:52,707
...bye.

102
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:54,125
Ah! Ok fine.

103
00:07:58,125 --> 00:07:58,958
Hey Ronit...

104
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:00,375
...what are you doing here?

105
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:02,832
I'm going to host the flag,
because today is 15th August.

106
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:04,291
Tell me, whose birthday is today?

107
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:06,125
Why it will be a birthday?

108
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:07,666
Today is Independence Day.

109
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:08,291
Huh!

110
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:09,416
Who told you?

111
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:10,666
Who will say!

112
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:11,625
Everyone knows it.

113
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:13,375
Go and ask to my father.

114
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:13,957
Oh!

115
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,958
Do you know your father's name?

116
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,750
Why won't I know my father's name!

117
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:19,625
My father's name is Santoshil Barui.

118
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:20,416
Hmmm…

119
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:23,625
...are you sure?

120
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:26,000
Isn't someone else your father?

121
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:27,291
Hey, rascal.

122
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:29,250
What the hell you are talking about.

123
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:30,082
Hey someone catch him...

124
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:31,250
...catch him, wait.

125
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:40,708
Ronit...

126
00:08:41,457 --> 00:08:42,415
...Ronit.

127
00:08:42,457 --> 00:08:44,583
I have told you that don't
talk to stupid guys.

128
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:46,458
Don't listen to rubbish talks.

129
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,250
Go,
host the flag and come to study.

130
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:52,375
Hello

131
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:53,375
Yes

132
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:57,500
No, no,
let's leave it for some more time...

133
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:58,500
...mean another one month.

134
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:02,250
Then you can see that the price will be hiked
and you will get handsome brokerage...

135
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:03,666
...I will also get profit.

136
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:06,083
Ok, ok, fine,
looking into it.

137
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:07,500
Give me couple of days.

138
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:10,125
Yes, I will let you know.

139
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:10,708
Huh!

140
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:11,916
Ok

141
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:24,916
Whom you want?

142
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:27,166
Please come outside.

143
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:29,791
Why?

144
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:32,083
Please come,
I need to talk with you.

145
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:35,416
I can hear your words very well...

146
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:37,165
...please let me know
from there itself.

147
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:39,125
Who has hosted the Flag?

148
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:41,415
Why?

149
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:42,083
Me.

150
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:44,000
You?

151
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:50,666
I thought that some illiterate servant
or little boy had done it.

152
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:53,375
What do you want to mean?

153
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,750
Aren't you able to
understand anything?

154
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:57,791
Look at the Flag properly for once.

155
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,333
What happened?

156
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:06,750
Really Surprising!

157
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:08,875
You are still not able to
understand anything!

158
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:11,208
You have hosted the Flag inverted.

159
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:18,541
Shame, shame on you.

160
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:21,833
If you do not have any respect
then why you people go to do all this stuff?

161
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:23,208
Don't you even know that...

162
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,333
...the colour of the upper part of
our National flag is saffron?

163
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:28,333
Listen...

164
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:30,875
...come inside and speak,
else you will get drenched at outside.

165
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:33,541
Nobody dies after being
drenched in rain for one day.

166
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:35,040
It seems that you don't know...

167
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:36,958
...how many people had sacrificed...

168
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,291
...and took the pain to
make our country free -

169
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:40,290
Leave it!

170
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:43,458
You needn't have to get much pain to
make me understood all these things.

171
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,250
If you are not coming inside
then you can leave now.

172
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:03,791
Mam...

173
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:05,040
Mam...

174
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:05,875
What happened?

175
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:08,041
Mam,
See what Rony is doing upstairs?

176
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:09,833
He is not at all listening to me...

177
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:11,333
he is getting drenched on the roof.

178
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:26,625
Ronit, how many time did I...

179
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:54,083
Ronit

180
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:57,916
Come here.

181
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:04,791
You will not beat me right?

182
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,916
Have I ever beat you?

183
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:10,625
Come

184
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:11,958
Namita

185
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:13,540
Namita, get one towel.

186
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:14,583
Coming Mam.

187
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,958
My son, you will get fever
if you drench in this way.

188
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,333
Please don't get drench in this way.

189
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:21,000
Take it Mam.

190
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:21,708
Give it.

191
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:24,333
Now go to bathroom and
have a proper bath.

192
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:27,250
Namita, Please bathe and
dress him properly...

193
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:28,291
Ok mam.

194
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:29,583
...now go my Son…

195
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:48,333
Aunty

196
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:50,916
Yes, come in. Come in.

197
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:55,666
Go and see what Prasanta
had messed up yesterday.

198
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:58,875
Scuffled and broken
his head totally.

199
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:00,666
Go, he is in the room.

200
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:07,208
Prasantada.
- Hmm…

201
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:11,041
Oh, You? Come, come,
come and sit.

202
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,000
I came just after heard your
news in the morning.

203
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:16,583
But got little bit late.

204
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:18,666
Hey! How you got
drenched so much?

205
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:20,458
Don't say anything!

206
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:23,916
While I was passing Baruipara,
the rain started all on a sudden.

207
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:27,665
Well, one rich family had
hosted a flag but was inverted.

208
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:32,540
When informed the housewife,
she didn't have any regrets.

209
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:35,665
As if it was a silly matter.

210
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,500
Then, I brought it down
and hosted it properly.

211
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:44,291
These rich peoples are
illiterate and snob.

212
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:47,125
Whatever, leave it.

213
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:49,583
How you got into this?

214
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:51,875
Don't say anything,

215
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:56,583
nowadays all people have
lost their humanity.

216
00:13:56,625 --> 00:14:00,291
Yesterday, when the rain started,
I got inside a shop's shade.

217
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:02,333
Hey, Get out, get out from here…

218
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:05,500
Leave me, please please let
me stay for a while…

219
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:06,666
Hey, what happened?
What happened?

220
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:07,915
Can't you see it's raining!

221
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:09,540
Having torn and ragged
wrapper, dirty smell.

222
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:10,833
So, because of that you
will throw him?

223
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:12,500
What's with you?
It's my shop. Let me decide.

224
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:14,083
No, no, just being a poor man you…

225
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:15,375
Hey Man, just get lost…

226
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:26,666
Was there no one else?

227
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:28,625
Everyone was present.

228
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:29,916
Pretending to be deaf and mute!

229
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:31,625
Was watching the rain!

230
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,458
I also didn't keep quiet.

231
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,166
I broke his nose with a single punch.

232
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:37,750
Well done!

233
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:40,666
These days people have
become dishonest and spineless.

234
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:42,750
Have forgotten to protest.

235
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:44,291
What's the need?

236
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:49,250
There is no meaning to give the life
helplessly for sake of heroism.

237
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:51,625
Aunty, what are you saying?

238
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:55,416
Will no one protest wrong things?
That's fatal crime.

239
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:57,790
I don't understand so much.

240
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:00,125
It's not a good time.

241
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:04,125
When everyone is
accepting all silently then...

242
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:06,958
...what is the need to get
into any mess?

243
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:09,541
No, Aunty.

244
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:12,666
I can't agree with your words.

245
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:15,250
As no one is protesting therefore
I should not also protest...

246
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:17,041
...this is just a coward's argument.

247
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,040
What Prasantada had done,

248
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:21,875
you should be proud for
being his mother.

249
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:24,625
Bhumika, leave it.

250
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:26,750
Have the tea and go home.

251
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:28,666
Your clothes are fully wet.

252
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:32,165
Have bath first
else you will get sick.

253
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:33,958
Don't think about me.

254
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,375
It's just a little injury.

255
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:38,000
Within tomorrow,
I will be fit.

256
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,416
Where did you go in this
early morning?

257
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:57,040
I had some work.

258
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:59,165
Definitely, at Prasanta's house right?

259
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:01,083
Hmmm…

260
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:41,416
It was 100% Prasanta's fault.

261
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:44,583
What do you mean?

262
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:46,958
Let me know who told you?

263
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:48,665
Who else will tell?

264
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:49,958
I was there nearby...

265
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,500
...have witnessed it.

266
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:55,500
That means you witnessed
that Prasantada got beaten...

267
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:57,500
...for protecting one helpless man...

268
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:59,583
...you had not yet spent
a single word!

269
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:00,583
Wow!

270
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:04,166
Have you changed your saree?

271
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:05,624
Let me host the flag then will do.

272
00:17:05,665 --> 00:17:07,832
How much time it will take
to leave the wet saree?

273
00:17:07,874 --> 00:17:09,665
Mom, it will also not take much
time to host the flag as well.

274
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:10,916
Mania, mania…

275
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:14,207
mania for the patriotism has been
awaked in your daughter.

276
00:17:14,249 --> 00:17:16,124
Has she got this mania just today?

277
00:17:16,165 --> 00:17:18,457
This came from her
Grandfather's time.

278
00:17:18,499 --> 00:17:21,665
Why, haven't you seen that your father
also used to roam...

279
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:24,999
...with his granddaughter
and tell all these stories?

280
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,957
Haven't I seen?

281
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:32,375
Freedom Fighter Ananta Mohan Biswas!

282
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:37,000
He had ruined the whole
family just for freedom.

283
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:39,832
Not even gave me a proper education.

284
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:41,750
Somehow though I got a job
in the factory...

285
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:43,416
...that also I have lost.

286
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:45,708
Freedom!

287
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:49,000
Isn't your factory will
open again?

288
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:50,666
No way!

289
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:53,416
Promoters are roaming for making Flats.

290
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:56,041
The land is supposed to be sold.

291
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:59,041
Does your daughter have
any idea about it?

292
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:03,000
She is just carrying the tradition
of Grandfather's patriotism.

293
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:06,500
And got accompanied by
another rascal Prasanta.

294
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:08,208
That Vagabond jobless fellow is...

295
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:11,500
...as like a glowing symbol
of truth and honesty!

296
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:13,458
Why did again you drag that guy?

297
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,458
Prasanta is very good guy.

298
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,625
Yes, I am only bad!

299
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:21,583
That day, I told to her that...

300
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:24,500
...ask Prasanta to find some job.

301
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:27,707
Oh, is it?

302
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,291
What did she say?

303
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,583
Do you want to know what she said?

304
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:35,250
She said, it seems that..

305
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:37,666
...we are not able to
understand Prasanta.

306
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:42,208
He has not born to live
luxurious life like others.

307
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:45,333
If born in America...

308
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,458
...he was supposed to be
Abraham Lincoln.

309
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,416
If born in Africa...

310
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:50,041
...he is supposed to be
Nelson Mandela.

311
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:51,125
If in Cuba...

312
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:52,875
...supposed to be Fidel Castro.

313
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:54,500
If born in dependent India, he was...

314
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:56,875
...supposed to be Netaji and…

315
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:59,041
...would have been Master-da.

316
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:02,208
Ah, how much is her age?

317
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:04,750
She loves Prasanta...

318
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:06,916
...lives on grandfather's idolism.

319
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:09,750
Now if she finds her grandfather's
idolism into Prasanta...

320
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:12,457
...I don't understand
what's the fault in it?

321
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:14,957
No, No, Where is the fault?

322
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:20,082
Father's factory had been
closed and earning is zero...

323
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:22,875
...if she does'nt understand it,
then we have lots of sufferings.

324
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:26,375
Vandemataram (Mother, I salute thee)…

325
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:30,625
Vandemataram…

326
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:34,625
Vandemataram…

327
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:38,332
Vandemataram…

328
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:42,291
Vandemataram…

329
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:49,375
Vandemataram…

330
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:55,041
Vandemataram…

331
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:57,250
Vandemataram…

332
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:21,500
Hello.

333
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:22,666
Hello, it's me.

334
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:23,708
What's the matter?

335
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,666
You called at such late night?

336
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:27,583
Just thought of you.

337
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:30,625
Tell me, who else is mine
except you?

338
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:32,416
At midnight! It seems
that your emotions...

339
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:34,000
...have swelled up!

340
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:36,791
No, believe me I am
saying the truth.

341
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:39,000
You know...

342
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:40,957
...just now I saw a dream.

343
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:45,583
You and I went to Kalighat
to offer worship.

344
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:49,832
You wore a “Garad”
saree with red flounce...

345
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:52,541
...a large vermillion dot at
your forehead.

346
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,791
You know...

347
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:58,082
...everyone were looking...

348
00:20:58,791 --> 00:20:59,916
...at us.

349
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:02,625
Tamasha...

350
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:05,416
...Tamasha,
I am pretty willing to...

351
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:08,707
What?

352
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:11,291
Willing...

353
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:13,250
...willing to...

354
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:15,000
...eat rice
from your hand.

355
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,875
Why Harababu?

356
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:19,041
Have your servant left home?

357
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:21,125
No, No, they haven't left.

358
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:23,750
But I am pretty willing to
eat at your hand.

359
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:27,541
But I never able to cook the
rice properly Harababu.

360
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:30,416
It becomes very soft like mud..

361
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:32,708
...or it remains hard and uncooked.

362
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:37,125
Tamasha, whether it's hard or soft
does not matter much.

363
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:41,083
As if you have served the rice
along with royal items...

364
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:43,875
...I am sitting on the floor and eating it.

365
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:47,457
In front of me
and fanning with a handfan.

366
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:51,833
The back of your blouse got drenched
by the wet hair just after the bath.

367
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:54,333
Wow, what an excellent scene!

368
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:55,916
Harababu...

369
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:57,875
...you are having indigestion.

370
00:21:58,291 --> 00:22:01,125
Do not be awake till
so late in this age.

371
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:03,500
Go to sleep.

372
00:22:03,541 --> 00:22:06,000
If you are kidding with me,
that's fine.

373
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:10,250
Either I am dead or alive –
it's because of you.

374
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:13,458
I will go tomorrow noon.

375
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:23,250
Hey Kanai.

376
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:24,457
Yes Sir.

377
00:22:26,208 --> 00:22:27,375
Come, Come here.

378
00:22:27,416 --> 00:22:28,582
This is Raju.

379
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:30,416
This is for your Madam's security.

380
00:22:30,458 --> 00:22:32,500
He will also stay at this
house from today onwards.

381
00:22:32,541 --> 00:22:33,916
You speak with him.

382
00:22:33,958 --> 00:22:35,666
Hello, have you brought
all your things?

383
00:22:35,708 --> 00:22:36,875
Yes, it's in the bag.

384
00:22:36,916 --> 00:22:38,666
Madam was speaking about
you yesterday.

385
00:22:38,708 --> 00:22:40,375
Come, will show you the room.
- Let's go.

386
00:23:07,875 --> 00:23:09,291
What's this!...

387
00:23:09,333 --> 00:23:10,666
...why haven't you called up?

388
00:23:10,708 --> 00:23:13,375
Was watching...

389
00:23:13,916 --> 00:23:17,000
...mean you were
sleeping so have not waked you up.

390
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,458
Why have you got up?

391
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,208
Please sleep.

392
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:22,458
Else you would have slept.

393
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,166
What are you saying?

394
00:23:24,208 --> 00:23:25,833
Do I always come to sleep?

395
00:23:25,875 --> 00:23:27,208
Tell me, how can I say it?

396
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:30,291
Because various kind of different
desires comes in your mind.

397
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:32,791
What a condition of your
health you made?

398
00:23:33,458 --> 00:23:36,583
Nowadays I really thinks a
lot about you Tamasa.

399
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:38,041
Really think about you.

400
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,166
Leave me, else Ronit will come.

401
00:23:40,208 --> 00:23:41,416
Doesn't he has school today?

402
00:23:41,458 --> 00:23:43,791
But how long it will take
to get finished!

403
00:23:48,666 --> 00:23:50,916
Isn't your jewel fellow
husband at home?

404
00:23:50,958 --> 00:23:52,916
No, he went to his friend's
house today.

405
00:23:52,958 --> 00:23:54,208
Oh, then…

406
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:55,208
Ah!

407
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,625
Not today.
Today nothing will happen.

408
00:23:58,666 --> 00:23:59,750
Let's talk about work.

409
00:23:59,791 --> 00:24:02,125
You are very cruel Tamasha.

410
00:24:04,166 --> 00:24:06,125
Basically whole women
race is cruel.

411
00:24:07,166 --> 00:24:07,832
Ok Listen...

412
00:24:07,875 --> 00:24:09,708
...I am leaving one boy named Raju.

413
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:10,750
Efficient boy.

414
00:24:10,791 --> 00:24:12,500
He will do
whatever you will ask,

415
00:24:12,541 --> 00:24:14,000
for your security.

416
00:24:14,041 --> 00:24:15,625
What about the Petrol Pump?

417
00:24:15,666 --> 00:24:17,582
That Land?
Tell me something about that.

418
00:24:17,625 --> 00:24:19,750
Rascal Ghosal is asking for
very high price.

419
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,457
Very troublesome.

420
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,291
That's why I asked you
earlier to pay some advance.

421
00:24:26,125 --> 00:24:29,208
Ah, that time the advertisement
was not published in the newspaper.

422
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:31,458
It would have been a risk
for the Petrol pump.

423
00:24:31,708 --> 00:24:33,750
Whatever need to do,
we need to do fast.

424
00:24:33,791 --> 00:24:35,957
Otherwise we need to look
for new land.

425
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,416
Absolutely right.

426
00:24:37,458 --> 00:24:39,375
Otherwise the pump
will get out of hand...

427
00:24:39,416 --> 00:24:41,666
...just because of not having
any land in our possession.

428
00:24:46,333 --> 00:24:48,166
Will you have some tea?

429
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:54,916
Even ready to have...

430
00:24:55,291 --> 00:24:57,041
...poison from you.

431
00:25:07,541 --> 00:25:10,000
Prasanta, do you eat something?

432
00:25:10,875 --> 00:25:11,791
No.

433
00:25:12,625 --> 00:25:14,541
Now you are rich person boss,

434
00:25:15,125 --> 00:25:17,458
how can you relish
beggar's rice?

435
00:25:17,791 --> 00:25:19,457
What are you saying!

436
00:25:21,166 --> 00:25:23,791
Montu, you have a good health...

437
00:25:24,041 --> 00:25:27,791
...then why do you beg
instead doing a job?

438
00:25:29,291 --> 00:25:33,207
Now see he is imparting
knowledge: Begging and begging.

439
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:35,291
Yes, otherwise where is the job?

440
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:37,958
Shall I dig the soil?
I can't do that.

441
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,583
Begging is better for me.

442
00:25:39,958 --> 00:25:41,125
But yes...

443
00:25:41,375 --> 00:25:44,875
...it's my luck that
you still come to my house.

444
00:25:44,916 --> 00:25:47,707
Hey, don't say all these.

445
00:25:48,625 --> 00:25:49,666
What are you saying?

446
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,375
Tell me, how many people remembers...

447
00:25:52,416 --> 00:25:54,541
...their childhood friends!

448
00:25:55,166 --> 00:25:56,707
Wait, I am coming.

449
00:26:04,958 --> 00:26:09,041
It's good that you haven't
eaten egg it's not good for you.

450
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,041
Wait,

451
00:26:21,708 --> 00:26:23,541
let me get the match stick.

452
00:26:25,666 --> 00:26:28,041
Hey, what are you watching?

453
00:26:28,416 --> 00:26:31,166
It's a stolen cigarette from
marriage house.

454
00:26:31,208 --> 00:26:33,416
That day I got into a
marriage house...

455
00:26:33,458 --> 00:26:36,458
...merely escaped
from being punished.

456
00:26:38,541 --> 00:26:40,791
How much you earn, Montu?

457
00:26:42,125 --> 00:26:43,541
Not bad.

458
00:26:44,958 --> 00:26:47,708
I was previously used to
beg in the train.

459
00:26:48,083 --> 00:26:49,875
Competition raised up.

460
00:26:50,708 --> 00:26:52,041
I left begging in the train.

461
00:26:52,416 --> 00:26:54,166
But yes,
I still travel by train.

462
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,750
After couple of stations
I get down.

463
00:26:56,791 --> 00:26:58,916
Choosing a good locality,
I start begging.

464
00:26:58,958 --> 00:27:00,083
That's all.

465
00:27:01,541 --> 00:27:03,332
Sometime my kidney is damaged...

466
00:27:03,375 --> 00:27:06,291
...sometime daughter's marriage.

467
00:27:07,166 --> 00:27:11,000
It's not a matter of 50 paisa or 1 rupee,
all 5 and 10 rupees.

468
00:27:11,041 --> 00:27:15,082
I gather all the reports,
chest x-ray – everything.

469
00:27:15,375 --> 00:27:16,791
Those are duplicate,
right?

470
00:27:17,041 --> 00:27:18,375
If you get caught then…

471
00:27:18,791 --> 00:27:19,707
Caught?

472
00:27:23,166 --> 00:27:25,791
No, No, let me tell you one incident.

473
00:27:26,333 --> 00:27:28,541
I usually work at Raipore.

474
00:27:29,125 --> 00:27:31,125
That day I went to Chandipore,

475
00:27:31,375 --> 00:27:33,708
only two stations from here.

476
00:27:34,333 --> 00:27:37,416
That was really an ultimate mess up.

477
00:27:38,583 --> 00:27:40,500
Is it your X-Ray plate?

478
00:27:40,791 --> 00:27:41,791
Yes Sir.

479
00:27:42,541 --> 00:27:44,625
Sir, My Kidney has totally damaged.

480
00:27:44,666 --> 00:27:46,416
Due to lack of money
can't have the treatment Sir.

481
00:27:46,458 --> 00:27:47,666
How long is this happening?

482
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:50,500
Sir, almost since 3-4 years,

483
00:27:50,541 --> 00:27:52,125
the Kidney has totally damaged Sir.

484
00:27:52,166 --> 00:27:53,750
I am not talking about Kidney.

485
00:27:53,791 --> 00:27:56,000
Asking, how long are you
running this practice of bluffing?

486
00:27:56,875 --> 00:27:57,791
Meaning Sir?

487
00:27:58,083 --> 00:27:58,666
Meaning?

488
00:27:59,625 --> 00:28:00,541
Swine...

489
00:28:00,583 --> 00:28:02,625
...you are teaching Dhoni
how to hit an over-boundary?

490
00:28:02,666 --> 00:28:07,166
Being a doctor since last 30 years,
you trying to fool me?

491
00:28:07,208 --> 00:28:09,416
And now you are teaching
me to identify the Kidney?

492
00:28:09,708 --> 00:28:13,333
Bluffing me by showing
an X-ray plate of someone else broken leg?

493
00:28:13,791 --> 00:28:15,125
Hey Bullshit?

494
00:28:15,166 --> 00:28:18,875
The plates might have swapped
between “Birpara” and “Chandipara”.

495
00:28:18,916 --> 00:28:19,541
I mean Sir…

496
00:28:19,583 --> 00:28:20,375
You Rascal...

497
00:28:20,666 --> 00:28:21,957
...still standing here?

498
00:28:22,291 --> 00:28:24,332
Pocha…hey Pocha…

499
00:28:24,375 --> 00:28:25,666
...Get me the Stick.

500
00:28:25,708 --> 00:28:29,083
After breaking both of your legs,
I will hand over the X-Ray plates by myself.

501
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:30,875
Running away?

502
00:28:30,916 --> 00:28:32,500
Catch, catch, catch…

503
00:28:32,541 --> 00:28:34,750
It was the worst day of my life.

504
00:28:34,791 --> 00:28:37,791
All earning was in vain.

505
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:40,958
Don't do all these Montu.

506
00:28:41,416 --> 00:28:43,375
One day you will be definitely entrapped.

507
00:28:43,416 --> 00:28:44,707
Huh!

508
00:28:47,166 --> 00:28:48,832
Today I shall tell you one thing.

509
00:28:48,875 --> 00:28:49,708
What?

510
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,041
Tell me, you will keep the promise?

511
00:28:52,791 --> 00:28:53,707
What?

512
00:28:56,416 --> 00:28:57,707
Let's marry.

513
00:28:59,333 --> 00:29:00,458
What happened?

514
00:29:02,958 --> 00:29:04,166
Great Idea.

515
00:29:04,875 --> 00:29:06,750
Your son will be groomsman...

516
00:29:06,791 --> 00:29:09,207
...and my husband will be the
head of bridegroom's party.

517
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:13,166
This is not a joke Tamasha.

518
00:29:13,208 --> 00:29:14,000
Truly, Truly.

519
00:29:14,041 --> 00:29:15,582
I am also seriously telling it.

520
00:29:15,625 --> 00:29:16,583
Marriage,

521
00:29:17,708 --> 00:29:19,625
once the marriage gets over,

522
00:29:19,666 --> 00:29:23,791
I will hand over the garment business
along with rice business to my son.

523
00:29:24,166 --> 00:29:26,541
Then he will not have any objection
about any matter.

524
00:29:27,416 --> 00:29:29,707
Will buy a flat at Kolkata.

525
00:29:30,208 --> 00:29:33,625
Along with Ronit we three shall stay there.

526
00:29:34,125 --> 00:29:36,583
Ronit's study will be better at Kolkata.

527
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,291
You need not think about Santoshil.

528
00:29:40,083 --> 00:29:41,625
He will stay in this house.

529
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:44,041
He will give the divorce...

530
00:29:44,083 --> 00:29:45,875
...and I will write this house in his name.

531
00:29:47,208 --> 00:29:50,458
We shall have our Petrol Pump.

532
00:29:59,958 --> 00:30:01,875
Hello Sir

533
00:30:01,916 --> 00:30:04,125
have you completed your Noon-walk?

534
00:30:04,166 --> 00:30:06,000
If possible please try to
walk in the morning,

535
00:30:06,041 --> 00:30:07,166
you will be benefited.

536
00:30:07,208 --> 00:30:10,000
Nothing will happen by
walking in the noon.

537
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:12,041
Hello Sir

538
00:30:14,666 --> 00:30:19,000
I have some confidential talk with you.

539
00:30:19,333 --> 00:30:20,375
Confidential talk!

540
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:21,250
Yes

541
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:24,333
always like to speak straight forward.

542
00:30:24,583 --> 00:30:27,708
Hope you all know about the relation
between me and your wife.

543
00:30:28,208 --> 00:30:31,208
Now I do not like to dance
under the veil anymore.

544
00:30:31,791 --> 00:30:34,082
So we decided to get married.

545
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:36,666
Married!

546
00:30:36,708 --> 00:30:37,583
Yes.

547
00:30:37,958 --> 00:30:41,166
Mean we are not able to
live without each other.

548
00:30:41,208 --> 00:30:42,541
You will not have any problem.

549
00:30:42,583 --> 00:30:44,208
You will sign to the divorce paper...

550
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:45,208
...will get a huge money...

551
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:46,583
...and the house will be
transferred to your name.

552
00:30:46,625 --> 00:30:50,166
Me and Tamasha along with Ronit
will go to Kolkata after buying a flat there.

553
00:30:50,208 --> 00:30:50,916
Oh, ok.

554
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:52,083
Yes

555
00:30:52,625 --> 00:30:54,583
I have already talked with Tamasha.

556
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:56,625
She agreed.

557
00:30:57,041 --> 00:31:00,207
Now if you give divorce without any hindrance
then the matter can be sorted out though.

558
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:03,333
If you don't give then also
you can't detain us.

559
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:08,583
Ok, Fine.

560
00:31:27,166 --> 00:31:28,457
What happened?

561
00:31:29,583 --> 00:31:31,125
Why are you sitting silently...

562
00:31:31,875 --> 00:31:33,083
...and not eating?

563
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,500
What's problem?

564
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,500
No, I am eating.

565
00:31:40,458 --> 00:31:41,541
I can understand that...

566
00:31:41,583 --> 00:31:46,875
...every day you don't like to
have “Potal”and small fishes.

567
00:31:48,791 --> 00:31:50,250
But what to do?

568
00:31:50,958 --> 00:31:52,625
It's because of your health condition!

569
00:31:54,208 --> 00:31:55,208
Namita…

570
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:56,083
Yes, Madam.

571
00:31:56,125 --> 00:31:57,291
Has Ranit slept?

572
00:31:57,333 --> 00:31:59,541
Yes, I have feed him and laid down to sleep.

573
00:31:59,583 --> 00:32:01,416
He has also slept.

574
00:32:11,708 --> 00:32:15,625
Why do you wear such
pale clothes all the time?

575
00:32:17,083 --> 00:32:20,791
Try some bright colors then...

576
00:32:21,916 --> 00:32:24,541
...you will have some change.

577
00:32:25,291 --> 00:32:26,416
Change?

578
00:32:27,541 --> 00:32:29,541
Yes, change.

579
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:33,416
If you wear some bright colors...

580
00:32:34,208 --> 00:32:36,250
your mind will be fresh...

581
00:32:37,041 --> 00:32:39,207
...and will also feel little bit better.

582
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:41,708
Hmm, ok.

583
00:32:54,166 --> 00:32:56,291
What happened?

584
00:32:58,291 --> 00:32:59,957
Shame, shame, shame….See,

585
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,541
what they have done to her hand.

586
00:33:01,583 --> 00:33:03,500
See, See Dada, what they have done.

587
00:33:03,541 --> 00:33:05,957
Dada, as we are poor,
aren't we human?

588
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,083
Dada, please you do some
proper justice for it?

589
00:33:08,125 --> 00:33:09,500
Are you fine Didi?

590
00:33:09,541 --> 00:33:10,916
My name is Milton,

591
00:33:10,958 --> 00:33:12,375
resides at “Jelepara”.

592
00:33:12,416 --> 00:33:13,957
We got some problem...

593
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,500
...so came to Dada.

594
00:33:21,041 --> 00:33:21,875
What happened?

595
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,666
This little girl works at one of
the houses at Banerjee para.

596
00:33:27,166 --> 00:33:31,250
There she clean
dishes, floor type of works.

597
00:33:31,791 --> 00:33:33,750
She had broken one flower vase...

598
00:33:33,791 --> 00:33:35,666
...and for that reason they
have brutally beaten her.

599
00:33:35,708 --> 00:33:37,750
Pulled and torn her hair,
see the condition of her hand.

600
00:33:37,791 --> 00:33:38,332
Alas!

601
00:33:38,375 --> 00:33:39,958
Seared by the cooking spud.

602
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:40,833
What will you say?

603
00:33:40,875 --> 00:33:41,625
Are they human?

604
00:33:41,666 --> 00:33:44,082
Can human be so much cruel?

605
00:33:45,625 --> 00:33:48,750
Even the people of his locality
is suggesting to go to police.

606
00:33:48,791 --> 00:33:50,416
Yes, we should do that.

607
00:33:50,458 --> 00:33:51,583
No, we should never do that.

608
00:33:51,625 --> 00:33:54,625
Police Station, Political leaders
all are dirty dove's den.

609
00:33:54,666 --> 00:33:55,832
Do you understand that?

610
00:33:55,875 --> 00:33:58,208
Huh! They are rich man's servant.

611
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:01,083
If you go there, this little child
will never get the justice.

612
00:34:01,791 --> 00:34:03,666
Whatever is needed,
only we have to do.

613
00:34:05,041 --> 00:34:06,125
Right

614
00:34:06,708 --> 00:34:09,124
I always want to see this Prasantada,

615
00:34:09,166 --> 00:34:11,458
who stand beside others, protests...

616
00:34:11,498 --> 00:34:13,665
...and will get back the right justice.

617
00:34:14,958 --> 00:34:15,833
Hmm…Hey Milton…

618
00:34:15,873 --> 00:34:16,790
Yes Dada…

619
00:34:17,791 --> 00:34:19,208
Let's go to the Banerjee Para.

620
00:34:19,248 --> 00:34:20,498
Ok, let's go.

621
00:34:21,958 --> 00:34:22,749
You do one thing,

622
00:34:22,791 --> 00:34:23,874
you stay here with her.

623
00:34:23,916 --> 00:34:24,458
Ok Dada.

624
00:34:24,498 --> 00:34:26,665
Bhumika, you stay with them for a while.

625
00:34:26,708 --> 00:34:29,416
Let me go, if it is needed I will call them.

626
00:34:29,458 --> 00:34:30,666
No, Prasantada.

627
00:34:31,083 --> 00:34:33,166
They will go and with them I will go too.

628
00:34:33,208 --> 00:34:36,666
Until we give a proper reply
to those Banerjee Family members...

629
00:34:36,708 --> 00:34:37,874
...I am not at rest.

630
00:34:37,916 --> 00:34:39,916
Therefore we all will go with you.

631
00:34:40,373 --> 00:34:41,623
Ok let's go.

632
00:34:41,666 --> 00:34:43,874
Let's go dada.

633
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:46,374
Rathinbabu

634
00:34:47,708 --> 00:34:49,041
Hey Rathinbabu.

635
00:34:50,373 --> 00:34:50,957
Who?

636
00:34:50,998 --> 00:34:52,332
Is Rathin Banerjee there?

637
00:34:52,708 --> 00:34:53,708
Who?

638
00:34:57,123 --> 00:34:59,250
What do you need here?

639
00:34:59,291 --> 00:35:01,166
We are looking for Rathin Banerjee.

640
00:35:01,208 --> 00:35:02,875
I am Rathin Banerjee.

641
00:35:03,208 --> 00:35:03,958
What do you need guys?

642
00:35:04,291 --> 00:35:05,625
What we need!

643
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
In your house one little
girl works named Mamoni…

644
00:35:09,041 --> 00:35:11,625
...you have brutally
tortured her.

645
00:35:12,541 --> 00:35:13,083
Why?

646
00:35:13,791 --> 00:35:15,041
You scoundrels!

647
00:35:15,375 --> 00:35:17,000
Poor class peoples!

648
00:35:17,041 --> 00:35:18,750
I have nothing to discuss with you

649
00:35:18,791 --> 00:35:19,791
Nothing…

650
00:35:20,208 --> 00:35:21,208
Out

651
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:23,291
Out, get out from here.

652
00:35:23,333 --> 00:35:25,250
If you speak another single word...

653
00:35:25,291 --> 00:35:26,875
...then I will be forced to
call the police.

654
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:27,833
Hey Rascal!

655
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:28,875
Police….

656
00:35:28,916 --> 00:35:30,666
Police will do nothing…Scoundrel,

657
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,666
you are torturing on the little girl,
Son of a swine…

658
00:35:33,708 --> 00:35:35,416
Today we will beat you
after taking out your pants…

659
00:35:35,458 --> 00:35:36,416
How dare you…

660
00:35:36,875 --> 00:35:38,291
...get out, get out from here, get out…

661
00:35:38,333 --> 00:35:41,250
Rascal, we will change the shape
of your face by beating…

662
00:35:41,291 --> 00:35:43,625
Hey, what are you doing this?

663
00:35:43,666 --> 00:35:44,750
Why are you cursing and beating?

664
00:35:44,791 --> 00:35:47,125
Hey! Please all of you keep quiet,

665
00:35:47,166 --> 00:35:48,208
please.

666
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:49,958
Dada, please go inside….

667
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:55,166
...please don't create any
scene unnecessarily.

668
00:35:55,208 --> 00:35:56,375
Now you see...

669
00:35:56,416 --> 00:35:57,750
...you see that little girl.

670
00:35:57,791 --> 00:35:59,375
What a condition you people have made?

671
00:35:59,416 --> 00:36:00,958
Don't you feel shame?

672
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,666
Please, not here.

673
00:36:03,708 --> 00:36:05,000
You please come inside...

674
00:36:05,041 --> 00:36:06,458
...I will listen to all of your words.

675
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,916
Please…

676
00:36:08,458 --> 00:36:09,416
Prasantada please go inside...

677
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:10,958
...and listen what she is saying.

678
00:36:18,875 --> 00:36:20,500
Aye...
- Hmm.

679
00:36:21,083 --> 00:36:22,583
...this is Runadidi.

680
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Who is she?

681
00:36:24,041 --> 00:36:25,291
Master's sister...

682
00:36:25,333 --> 00:36:27,875
...stays abroad.
Works in a big company.

683
00:36:34,791 --> 00:36:35,750
Hello

684
00:36:35,791 --> 00:36:37,666
yes mom,

685
00:36:38,791 --> 00:36:39,875
tell me? What?

686
00:36:40,625 --> 00:36:42,333
What has happened to father?

687
00:36:42,375 --> 00:36:44,333
No, No, I am right away...

688
00:36:44,375 --> 00:36:47,791
...yes, coming right away,
don't get tensed.

689
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:51,708
Now there is nothing to worry.

690
00:36:52,666 --> 00:36:56,666
Medicine is working,
now he is fine.

691
00:36:57,791 --> 00:37:02,041
Let him take rest for two
days then he will be alright.

692
00:37:02,791 --> 00:37:05,041
Hey, your daughter also came.

693
00:37:05,083 --> 00:37:07,041
Let's go Doctor.

694
00:37:07,083 --> 00:37:08,583
Let's go.

695
00:37:13,333 --> 00:37:15,208
Mom, what happened?

696
00:37:15,625 --> 00:37:16,875
Don't ask about it.

697
00:37:17,375 --> 00:37:20,458
I was so much frightened.

698
00:37:21,208 --> 00:37:24,291
Your father became senseless
after going to bathroom.

699
00:37:24,333 --> 00:37:27,458
Luckily Rashubabu was
present at that time.

700
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,166
Who is Rashubabu?

701
00:37:29,208 --> 00:37:31,583
He was the very person who
called the doctor.

702
00:37:31,625 --> 00:37:34,000
I called you from his cellphone only.

703
00:37:34,041 --> 00:37:36,333
Ok, you tell me what doctor had said?

704
00:37:37,291 --> 00:37:41,458
Due to huge gastritis and indigestion
the chest pain occurred...

705
00:37:41,791 --> 00:37:44,500
...and he became senseless.

706
00:37:46,791 --> 00:37:48,958
Rashubabu brought the medicines.

707
00:37:51,041 --> 00:37:55,416
He was telling someone
wants to buy our house.

708
00:37:55,458 --> 00:37:56,666
Our house?

709
00:37:56,708 --> 00:37:57,875
Yes.

710
00:37:58,791 --> 00:38:01,208
Was saying there is a
good customer.

711
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:02,500
Will give lot of money.

712
00:38:03,166 --> 00:38:04,333
What did dad say?

713
00:38:04,375 --> 00:38:06,083
Will he sell the house?

714
00:38:06,708 --> 00:38:08,333
How will the discussion happen?

715
00:38:08,375 --> 00:38:11,208
In the meantime, this
mishap happened.

716
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:16,083
He told to Rashubabu that...

717
00:38:16,125 --> 00:38:18,458
...he would be back from
bathroom within a minute.

718
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,958
When he was not
coming for a long time.

719
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,083
Then we found this…

720
00:38:23,708 --> 00:38:25,541
...but

721
00:38:25,583 --> 00:38:28,916
Rashubabu is a good person.

722
00:38:28,958 --> 00:38:33,291
He arranged all thing on a rush.

723
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,083
This house!

724
00:38:36,125 --> 00:38:39,666
Dad will sell this house?

725
00:38:41,458 --> 00:38:42,625
Impossible!

726
00:38:42,916 --> 00:38:45,458
Now whom I have appointed is a veil.

727
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:47,708
Already he has provided
one news about a land.

728
00:38:48,166 --> 00:38:50,041
Owner's situation is not good.

729
00:38:50,083 --> 00:38:52,041
Need some money.

730
00:38:52,083 --> 00:38:55,166
If they get cash they will
give it at much lower rate.

731
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:57,375
Whatever you want to do, do it fast.

732
00:38:57,416 --> 00:38:58,750
Aha...

733
00:38:58,791 --> 00:39:01,666
...just close your eyes
and have faith in me.

734
00:39:01,708 --> 00:39:03,000
Huh!

735
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:06,916
Have you ever been disappointed
in keeping faith on me?

736
00:39:08,791 --> 00:39:11,750
After the pump will have a flat.

737
00:39:11,791 --> 00:39:14,291
Yours and mine.

738
00:39:14,333 --> 00:39:16,375
Aha!

739
00:39:16,416 --> 00:39:19,125
My longtime dream.

740
00:39:19,791 --> 00:39:24,666
Does you at all fit with
that skeleton?

741
00:39:24,708 --> 00:39:29,500
Is he a deserving husband
for a lady like you?

742
00:39:32,708 --> 00:39:34,666
You don't know Harababu,

743
00:39:34,708 --> 00:39:38,208
I was born with what kind
of luck to have a worthy husband!

744
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:42,625
He was the most intelligent
boy among our locality.

745
00:39:42,666 --> 00:39:46,041
He was Parambrata.

746
00:39:46,083 --> 00:39:47,291
My...

747
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,750
...my Param.

748
00:39:49,791 --> 00:39:52,041
How are you?...
- Good…

749
00:39:52,083 --> 00:39:55,375
Our marriage was finalized.

750
00:39:55,916 --> 00:40:00,250
Our both family had happily
given their permission.

751
00:40:00,291 --> 00:40:02,583
I used to go to Param's house.

752
00:40:02,625 --> 00:40:04,666
Param also used to
come to our house.

753
00:40:04,708 --> 00:40:10,291
We were supposed to
get united shortly.

754
00:40:11,541 --> 00:40:16,083
In the meantime my friend
Surabhi's marriage took place.

755
00:40:16,125 --> 00:40:19,500
Hey, please come with your husband...
- sure.

756
00:40:19,541 --> 00:40:21,500
Let me leave for the day.

757
00:40:21,541 --> 00:40:24,166
Uncle was supposed to come.
Did he come?

758
00:40:24,208 --> 00:40:26,333
Don't know.
Dad was supposed to come.

759
00:40:26,375 --> 00:40:29,375
But not reached yet,
how long I will wait?

760
00:40:29,416 --> 00:40:32,250
Looking at the sky, it seems
to start raining anytime.

761
00:40:32,291 --> 00:40:33,208
Let me leave for today.

762
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:34,583
Please don't mind.
- No, no, it's ok.

763
00:40:34,625 --> 00:40:36,041
Please come to our house?
- Sure.

764
00:40:36,083 --> 00:40:38,583
Will meet again.
Tata, Bye.

765
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:02,125
Issshh!
I got drenched fully.

766
00:41:05,708 --> 00:41:08,791
Oh My God,
Give me one cigarette.

767
00:41:09,791 --> 00:41:11,958
Boss, take it.

768
00:41:12,875 --> 00:41:14,916
Boss, look at it…

769
00:41:15,708 --> 00:41:16,583
Huh!...

770
00:41:36,083 --> 00:41:37,416
Where you will go?

771
00:41:39,416 --> 00:41:41,041
Leave me…

772
00:41:44,125 --> 00:41:46,500
Let's go behind the bushes…

773
00:41:47,791 --> 00:41:49,791
Help... help... help.

774
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:53,166
Leave me…

775
00:41:54,541 --> 00:41:56,791
What are you doing!...

776
00:41:59,333 --> 00:42:02,000
Save me, save…..

777
00:42:48,458 --> 00:42:53,250
What has been gone
through me last three days...

778
00:42:54,916 --> 00:42:56,541
...you don't know.

779
00:43:01,208 --> 00:43:05,333
I was restless just to see you once.

780
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:11,000
Param, Param,
haven't you informed?

781
00:43:12,625 --> 00:43:13,625
Yes

782
00:43:13,958 --> 00:43:15,541
Then why didn't you came?

783
00:43:16,875 --> 00:43:23,125
Such a traumatic incident happened,
still you have not come.

784
00:43:26,083 --> 00:43:33,416
I was just living on your trust.

785
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,791
Param...

786
00:43:41,583 --> 00:43:43,875
...Param, you will never
leave me, right?

787
00:43:43,916 --> 00:43:46,666
You will never leave me, right?

788
00:43:50,291 --> 00:43:52,500
You will be with me, right?

789
00:43:52,541 --> 00:43:53,541
Param...

790
00:43:53,583 --> 00:43:55,291
...you will never leave me, right?

791
00:43:55,958 --> 00:43:57,208
Our...

792
00:43:57,916 --> 00:43:58,583
Our...

793
00:44:00,458 --> 00:44:02,833
...our so longtime relation.

794
00:44:02,875 --> 00:44:05,458
Param, tell me?

795
00:44:05,708 --> 00:44:07,208
Our love…

796
00:44:11,458 --> 00:44:13,375
I have to leave.

797
00:44:48,666 --> 00:44:50,166
Are you going out madam?

798
00:44:50,208 --> 00:44:51,250
Yes...

799
00:44:51,291 --> 00:44:52,500
...going for shopping.

800
00:44:52,541 --> 00:44:54,375
Shall I come with you, Madam?

801
00:44:54,416 --> 00:44:57,083
No, If requires I will call you.

802
00:44:58,041 --> 00:45:00,958
Please show me some
bright colour shirts?

803
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,416
As he is a thin and slick person.

804
00:45:02,458 --> 00:45:03,791
Ok madam, will show you.

805
00:45:05,708 --> 00:45:07,750
Hey, please move this side?

806
00:45:07,791 --> 00:45:08,875
Do you like this colour?

807
00:45:08,916 --> 00:45:10,333
Why, what's wrong?

808
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:13,958
Colour is fine but there is some
confusion with the size...

809
00:45:15,208 --> 00:45:16,291
Wait, let me see?

810
00:45:16,333 --> 00:45:17,083
I told you right.

811
00:45:17,125 --> 00:45:18,958
See this.

812
00:45:21,208 --> 00:45:25,208
Then let's finalize all arrangements
for the marriage right?

813
00:45:25,250 --> 00:45:27,541
Tell me when will
we visit your house?

814
00:45:27,583 --> 00:45:30,000
Mean, we need to
talk with your mother.

815
00:45:30,041 --> 00:45:33,458
No, no, you don't need to
talk to mom.

816
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:36,666
Means my choice is
mom's choice.

817
00:45:36,708 --> 00:45:39,458
Great, if so then that's all.

818
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:42,791
So the marriage between
Santoshil and Tamasha is final.

819
00:45:45,291 --> 00:45:50,916
See, See….You told that
you have seen the bride!

820
00:45:50,958 --> 00:45:59,625
No, means somehow bit
different! See the condition!

821
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:35,083
Tamasha!

822
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:45,250
Dada, why did you do this?

823
00:46:46,916 --> 00:46:48,083
Why did it?

824
00:46:52,791 --> 00:46:56,791
He is not that person
who came to see me.

825
00:46:59,375 --> 00:47:03,541
You, you just cheated
me this way!

826
00:47:03,583 --> 00:47:05,458
No...

827
00:47:08,791 --> 00:47:11,166
...believe me,

828
00:47:11,625 --> 00:47:14,375
I also didn't even know
the real matter.

829
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:18,625
I got to know when
went to their house.

830
00:47:19,375 --> 00:47:21,958
Santoshil is his elder brother.

831
00:47:23,625 --> 00:47:26,916
Still that time you would
have informed me.

832
00:47:26,958 --> 00:47:29,125
At that time…

833
00:47:31,708 --> 00:47:34,291
...and even if I told you
what would have changed?

834
00:47:34,333 --> 00:47:37,041
It's not that people from few
sources came to see you.

835
00:47:37,083 --> 00:47:41,125
Whenever they heard raped
girl, they broke all relations.

836
00:47:45,416 --> 00:47:48,208
Dad passed away in
grief and sorrow.

837
00:47:48,791 --> 00:47:50,666
Mom's condition is this!

838
00:47:51,958 --> 00:47:54,791
Still they agreed for your marriage.

839
00:47:58,083 --> 00:48:02,958
The guy is bit thin, that's it.

840
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:09,708
If you take proper care,
you can see he will totally change.

841
00:48:12,708 --> 00:48:14,791
I have talked with Santashil.

842
00:48:15,625 --> 00:48:17,375
Very good guy.

843
00:48:24,958 --> 00:48:28,458
At first he has not
agreed to marry in this way.

844
00:48:29,541 --> 00:48:31,916
Later, agreed for his mother.

845
00:48:33,708 --> 00:48:36,625
All mothers have thought.

846
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:42,791
Who came to see you...

847
00:48:43,791 --> 00:48:45,166
...is Dibakar,

848
00:48:45,208 --> 00:48:46,291
...lives abroad.

849
00:48:49,375 --> 00:48:53,291
After the death of that old lady,
who will look after Santoshil?

850
00:48:55,375 --> 00:48:57,625
Tamasha, try to understand a bit.

851
00:48:58,250 --> 00:49:01,791
Though one eyed and lame,
after all he is a man, right?

852
00:49:04,416 --> 00:49:09,500
If he has a wife then someone
will be there to look after him.

853
00:49:11,958 --> 00:49:13,291
You leave now.

854
00:49:14,791 --> 00:49:17,500
You just leave Dada...

855
00:49:17,791 --> 00:49:19,583
...you just leave.

856
00:49:25,375 --> 00:49:27,083
Doctor...

857
00:49:27,125 --> 00:49:29,291
what else I have to do?

858
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:31,958
You have lot of things to do.

859
00:49:32,708 --> 00:49:33,500
A lot.

860
00:49:34,416 --> 00:49:37,458
You have inner power,
inner spirit.

861
00:49:37,916 --> 00:49:39,625
You have to be self-independent.

862
00:49:39,666 --> 00:49:41,625
You have to earn money.

863
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,875
This will enhance your self-confidence.

864
00:49:48,291 --> 00:49:51,666
You will find the
meaning of your life.

865
00:49:53,125 --> 00:49:54,208
Come.

866
00:50:06,625 --> 00:50:08,708
Have you seen those coconuts?

867
00:50:09,333 --> 00:50:11,208
There are so many
coconuts in those trees.

868
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:12,625
Why don't you start with those?

869
00:50:12,666 --> 00:50:16,416
If you sell those in whole sell
then you will get lot of money.

870
00:50:16,666 --> 00:50:17,750
Gradually start it.

871
00:50:17,791 --> 00:50:20,583
Then buy another garden
and enhance the business.

872
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:24,750
I will take you those people
who does poultry firm business.

873
00:50:24,791 --> 00:50:25,875
Do you understand?

874
00:50:25,916 --> 00:50:29,666
Now understand the logic and
take a poultry firm in lease and start that.

875
00:50:29,708 --> 00:50:30,791
Lots of profit.

876
00:50:31,458 --> 00:50:32,166
Listen,

877
00:50:32,208 --> 00:50:37,416
if you have money you will see
lots of problems will disappear.

878
00:50:38,083 --> 00:50:38,916
But..

879
00:50:39,416 --> 00:50:41,166
...it requires lots of money.

880
00:50:41,208 --> 00:50:41,833
Why

881
00:50:41,875 --> 00:50:43,666
I will give it to you.

882
00:50:43,708 --> 00:50:45,125
Am I not providing it?

883
00:50:45,166 --> 00:50:46,666
Tell me.

884
00:50:46,708 --> 00:50:49,958
You are carrying
Santoshil's treatment at home...

885
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,541
...am I not giving the money?

886
00:50:51,583 --> 00:50:53,166
What, giving it right?

887
00:50:53,791 --> 00:50:55,916
Now I will give you for real venture.

888
00:50:57,708 --> 00:50:59,708
In return, what I need...

889
00:51:00,958 --> 00:51:02,583
...that I have already told you,

890
00:51:03,708 --> 00:51:06,000
you never agreed.

891
00:51:07,458 --> 00:51:10,000
But now get agreed for it Tamasha.

892
00:51:10,041 --> 00:51:12,583
Just for the sake of your life.

893
00:51:12,625 --> 00:51:13,541
Yes

894
00:51:14,125 --> 00:51:20,083
See you have to take care
of you and your child's future.

895
00:51:20,791 --> 00:51:25,666
Do not choose a half-dead's life by
serving for a handicapped person.

896
00:51:25,708 --> 00:51:27,875
Live like a human.

897
00:51:28,541 --> 00:51:30,416
This life is your Tamasha,

898
00:51:30,458 --> 00:51:31,791
your.

899
00:51:32,708 --> 00:51:36,250
If your life goes away,
nobody will give you another life.

900
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,583
Tell me, agreed?

901
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:51,041
Ok, fine.

902
00:51:51,375 --> 00:51:54,583
I will not do anything
against your wish.

903
00:51:56,791 --> 00:51:58,208
I am leaving.

904
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:01,708
Doctor...

905
00:52:04,208 --> 00:52:05,541
...I want to live.

906
00:52:05,583 --> 00:52:08,083
The Morning is changing

907
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:10,250
The day is changing

908
00:52:10,625 --> 00:52:12,541
Life wants to survive

909
00:52:13,125 --> 00:52:16,750
Life wants to survive

910
00:52:16,791 --> 00:52:20,916
Whether it needs to repay
the debt to you?

911
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:26,208
Secret witness my body
knows what's remaining.

912
00:52:35,416 --> 00:52:43,208
It's burning vast field,
quicksand and only quicksand everywhere.

913
00:52:46,958 --> 00:52:52,250
It's a compromise,
only compromise with desire to live…

914
00:52:54,208 --> 00:52:56,833
If you stretched your hand,

915
00:52:56,875 --> 00:52:59,416
I will out of your vision

916
00:52:59,458 --> 00:53:04,083
Keep my thirst in those hilly region

917
00:53:06,583 --> 00:53:09,041
It's only defeat in return

918
00:53:09,083 --> 00:53:15,333
Still becomes alive after death.

919
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:27,083
It's burning vast field,
Quicksand and only quicksand everywhere.

920
00:54:04,083 --> 00:54:09,333
In return we need more and more

921
00:54:11,250 --> 00:54:16,083
Plans are imaginary, Dreams are imaginary

922
00:54:16,125 --> 00:54:22,250
Gradually identify the
companion of your journey

923
00:54:23,625 --> 00:54:26,625
Identify the companion of
your journey…

924
00:54:28,083 --> 00:54:30,458
In return we need more and more

925
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:32,916
Throat touching thirst

926
00:54:32,958 --> 00:54:38,500
Penetrating the celling of life's desire
To touch the sky…

927
00:54:40,166 --> 00:54:44,833
Plans are imaginary,
dreams are imaginary

928
00:54:44,875 --> 00:54:48,666
Quicksand and only
quicksand everywhere.

929
00:54:49,583 --> 00:54:54,166
It's burning vast field,
Quicksand and only quicksand everywhere.

930
00:55:18,291 --> 00:55:22,083
Now I am alive in this way

931
00:55:25,708 --> 00:55:28,041
Sleep is touching the eyes

932
00:55:28,083 --> 00:55:30,500
Dreams never come

933
00:55:30,541 --> 00:55:33,750
The blind lane is full with
embarrassed color

934
00:55:33,791 --> 00:55:35,333
The night became silent...

935
00:55:35,375 --> 00:55:37,125
...and silent

936
00:55:37,708 --> 00:55:40,708
Dreams never come

937
00:55:42,541 --> 00:55:44,833
Life is changing

938
00:55:44,875 --> 00:55:47,333
But still it is hypnotic

939
00:55:47,375 --> 00:55:54,416
Shaded faces are going away
Silence is awaked…Silence

940
00:55:54,458 --> 00:55:56,875
Sleep is touching the eyes.

941
00:55:56,916 --> 00:55:59,458
Dreams are not coming

942
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:04,125
Quicksand and only
quicksand everywhere.

943
00:56:04,166 --> 00:56:06,041
It's burning vast field,

944
00:56:06,083 --> 00:56:09,583
Quicksand and only
quicksand everywhere.

945
00:56:10,541 --> 00:56:12,500
Have something to say.

946
00:56:21,958 --> 00:56:23,041
What?

947
00:56:23,083 --> 00:56:25,375
Are you doing the right thing?

948
00:56:26,166 --> 00:56:28,333
I do not think that I am
doing anything wrong.

949
00:56:29,250 --> 00:56:32,666
As like you I also have
desire to live.

950
00:56:32,708 --> 00:56:36,041
Insect will destroy the
grains of your youth.

951
00:56:36,541 --> 00:56:37,500
Insect!

952
00:56:39,291 --> 00:56:41,041
If insect will destroy my youth
then it will ultimately your loss.

953
00:56:41,083 --> 00:56:46,250
Coconut, poultry, that person
who just now went down,

954
00:56:46,291 --> 00:56:53,000
Bread, butter, spices and half ownership
of the business everything will be finished.

955
00:56:53,041 --> 00:56:56,833
Everything is in lieu of my youth only.

956
00:56:56,875 --> 00:56:57,833
Isn't it?

957
00:56:57,875 --> 00:57:02,000
Just think of your past condition
and at present how you living.

958
00:57:02,041 --> 00:57:03,666
Do you understand that difference?

959
00:57:03,708 --> 00:57:05,250
Do you?

960
00:57:05,291 --> 00:57:08,500
Then pray for my youth so
that it will stay fine.

961
00:57:08,541 --> 00:57:10,750
All these nasty things will
never be permitted in this house.

962
00:57:10,791 --> 00:57:12,666
Even I also can't accept it anymore.

963
00:57:12,708 --> 00:57:16,291
I am also looking for separate house.
We will also leave this house soon.

964
00:57:16,333 --> 00:57:17,541
We means?

965
00:57:17,583 --> 00:57:18,875
We means us.

966
00:57:18,916 --> 00:57:20,250
Only us.

967
00:57:20,291 --> 00:57:22,958
Ask your son Dibakar whom
you have shown before my marriage...

968
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,666
...tell him to stay here with
you along with his wife.

969
00:57:25,708 --> 00:57:29,250
I will leave this house along
with my son and my husband.

970
00:57:29,291 --> 00:57:30,291
No, Santo will never go.

971
00:57:30,333 --> 00:57:33,250
I being his mother is
saying that he will never go.

972
00:57:33,291 --> 00:57:35,541
He will go.

973
00:57:36,333 --> 00:57:37,666
I being his wife is saying this.

974
00:57:37,708 --> 00:57:39,625
Ahhh… wife?

975
00:57:39,666 --> 00:57:41,416
Despite of you do all your
dirty works in front of his eye,

976
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:43,416
still claiming as his wife.

977
00:57:43,458 --> 00:57:44,750
Don't you feel shame?

978
00:57:44,791 --> 00:57:46,916
No, I don't.

979
00:57:46,958 --> 00:57:49,750
You have intended to get him married
with me for your own interest.

980
00:57:49,791 --> 00:57:54,375
You wanted me to serve your
weak son to get cured.

981
00:57:54,958 --> 00:57:59,208
That's why, you people had persuade
him to me by dirty way and lies.

982
00:57:59,250 --> 00:58:07,416
I have done my duty
after marriage to get him cured.

983
00:58:07,458 --> 00:58:10,416
I gave him the opportunity
to become a father.

984
00:58:10,458 --> 00:58:15,708
Therefore today my rights on him
is much higher than you.

985
00:58:16,041 --> 00:58:18,666
He can't live without
depending on me.

986
00:58:18,708 --> 00:58:20,750
Whatever I will say he will listen.

987
00:58:20,791 --> 00:58:26,375
If you can, try to hold your son,
hold your son.

988
00:58:27,291 --> 00:58:28,875
Son, son...

989
00:58:28,916 --> 00:58:30,791
tell me, won't you stay with me?

990
00:58:33,708 --> 00:58:34,750
Son, don't be silent.

991
00:58:34,791 --> 00:58:36,541
Tell me...

992
00:58:44,875 --> 00:58:46,708
Dad, dad.

993
00:58:47,916 --> 00:58:49,916
Yes my son, are you playing?

994
00:58:49,958 --> 00:58:52,625
Yes, you know dad,
Raju uncle has brought me this.

995
00:58:52,666 --> 00:58:54,750
Ok.
- Mom has bought it.

996
00:58:54,791 --> 00:58:56,916
Good one right?

997
00:58:56,958 --> 00:59:00,166
Very good, my beloved son,
my beloved son.

998
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:08,125
Can you stay
apart from me?

999
00:59:08,666 --> 00:59:09,833
Why I will be apart?

1000
00:59:09,875 --> 00:59:12,875
I, you and mom shall stay together.

1001
00:59:12,916 --> 00:59:20,041
Let, if some day your mother
and you go away from me.

1002
00:59:20,583 --> 00:59:22,125
Do you feel sad?

1003
00:59:22,166 --> 00:59:23,833
I will feel very sad.

1004
00:59:23,875 --> 00:59:27,083
I can't stay without you and mom.

1005
00:59:34,791 --> 00:59:36,000
Dad, will you play ball?

1006
00:59:36,041 --> 00:59:38,541
Yes, pass it.

1007
00:59:40,958 --> 00:59:41,666
Take it.

1008
00:59:41,708 --> 00:59:42,708
Ronit...

1009
00:59:44,791 --> 00:59:46,000
...don't you have study?

1010
00:59:46,041 --> 00:59:48,291
What will happen if you only play?

1011
00:59:48,333 --> 00:59:51,666
I will keep the ball above the almirah.

1012
00:59:51,708 --> 00:59:55,000
Go and study.
- Go…

1013
01:00:07,375 --> 01:00:09,333
Don't have network?

1014
01:00:11,708 --> 01:00:13,166
It has.

1015
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,916
Are you going anywhere?

1016
01:00:22,125 --> 01:00:23,375
Why?

1017
01:00:24,625 --> 01:00:27,166
No, just like that.

1018
01:00:30,791 --> 01:00:33,208
I wanted to talk with you.

1019
01:00:33,875 --> 01:00:35,125
With me?

1020
01:00:35,166 --> 01:00:36,291
Yes.

1021
01:00:36,333 --> 01:00:37,166
What?

1022
01:00:37,208 --> 01:00:38,625
Some important talk.

1023
01:00:39,958 --> 01:00:43,041
Just say what you want to say.
I don't have time.

1024
01:00:43,375 --> 01:00:49,250
No, Harababu was saying.
I want to ask is that true?

1025
01:00:50,666 --> 01:00:52,083
What did he say?

1026
01:00:52,125 --> 01:00:58,625
He was saying that both of you
are going to Kolkata to start a new family.

1027
01:01:01,250 --> 01:01:02,833
When did he say?

1028
01:01:02,875 --> 01:01:09,125
Just few days back...
that both of you are getting married.

1029
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:16,500
If so, do you have any
objection in that?

1030
01:01:24,041 --> 01:01:26,041
Still now nothing has been finalized.

1031
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:27,791
But...

1032
01:01:29,875 --> 01:01:31,166
I am thinking of it.

1033
01:01:47,333 --> 01:01:48,500
Yes, Hello.

1034
01:01:48,541 --> 01:01:49,875
Yes, it's Ratul speaking dada.

1035
01:01:49,916 --> 01:01:51,666
Ah, not to say.

1036
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:55,333
Tell me brother,
I never able to imagine that you will call.

1037
01:01:55,375 --> 01:01:57,625
So, what's up?
Is there any luck?

1038
01:01:57,666 --> 01:02:00,916
Yes, of course. Harada,
I have got a date from M.P Arjun Roy.

1039
01:02:00,958 --> 01:02:01,875
Do you know the meaning?

1040
01:02:01,916 --> 01:02:04,166
Of course, I do.

1041
01:02:04,208 --> 01:02:09,708
Getting date from M.P Arjun Roy means
we are close to the petrol pump.

1042
01:02:21,625 --> 01:02:25,291
Hello, are you going for noon walk?

1043
01:02:26,291 --> 01:02:29,541
Have you
already found the house?

1044
01:02:29,583 --> 01:02:30,666
What?

1045
01:02:30,708 --> 01:02:32,666
Flat or house?

1046
01:02:32,708 --> 01:02:34,041
I can't understand.

1047
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:37,750
No, means it seems that you
both are getting married very soon.

1048
01:02:37,791 --> 01:02:40,000
Tamasha was saying.

1049
01:02:40,958 --> 01:02:42,375
Did Tamasha told this?

1050
01:02:43,166 --> 01:02:45,541
What exactly she had told?

1051
01:02:45,583 --> 01:02:49,500
She was saying that both of you
are getting married very soon. That's only.

1052
01:02:49,541 --> 01:02:51,208
Flat or house?

1053
01:02:51,250 --> 01:02:54,708
I will, I will.
When Tamasa told.

1054
01:02:56,916 --> 01:02:58,625
Have you eaten something?

1055
01:02:58,666 --> 01:03:00,500
A strange smell is coming
out from your mouth.

1056
01:03:00,541 --> 01:03:01,666
Medicine.

1057
01:03:01,708 --> 01:03:03,458
A spoon after having food.

1058
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:05,500
Hmm, for what?

1059
01:03:05,541 --> 01:03:07,000
What is the disease?

1060
01:03:07,541 --> 01:03:08,791
'Back spasm'.

1061
01:03:09,250 --> 01:03:10,625
Ok.

1062
01:03:10,666 --> 01:03:11,875
Please come.

1063
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:15,541
Back...

1064
01:03:22,166 --> 01:03:23,208
Please come.

1065
01:03:24,916 --> 01:03:26,333
Why are you late?

1066
01:03:26,666 --> 01:03:27,958
We need to go out,
right?

1067
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,166
First listen to a grand news,

1068
01:03:30,208 --> 01:03:32,375
M.P Arjun Roy's
appointment is being fixed.

1069
01:03:32,416 --> 01:03:33,791
Sunday at 2PM.

1070
01:03:34,541 --> 01:03:36,750
That's why I kept Ratul for it.

1071
01:03:36,791 --> 01:03:38,125
We are ban on target.

1072
01:03:38,166 --> 01:03:40,333
Then be happy with that only.

1073
01:03:40,375 --> 01:03:43,333
There are lot of people like us
who used to meet Arjun Roy.

1074
01:03:43,375 --> 01:03:47,083
Listen, meeting isn't a big deal
rather the most important thing is to work done.

1075
01:03:47,125 --> 01:03:49,666
Hello, everyone doesn't have Ratul.

1076
01:03:49,708 --> 01:03:51,916
Ratul is Arjun Roy's Right hand.

1077
01:03:51,958 --> 01:03:55,125
During election he covers a huge area
and brings a lot of votes.

1078
01:03:55,166 --> 01:03:58,250
Therefore Arjun Roy treat
Ratul in different way.

1079
01:03:58,583 --> 01:04:02,125
Now that Ratul is with us.

1080
01:04:02,166 --> 01:04:03,666
Who can defeat us!

1081
01:04:03,708 --> 01:04:05,000
Leave all these,

1082
01:04:05,041 --> 01:04:06,916
These M.Ps used to rove people and...

1083
01:04:06,958 --> 01:04:10,291
...they have a lot of close
people like you and Ratul.

1084
01:04:10,333 --> 01:04:12,750
Ah, I feel that there would
not be any issue.

1085
01:04:12,791 --> 01:04:14,541
My mind is saying this.

1086
01:04:17,625 --> 01:04:20,083
But it will not happen just
because your mind is saying.

1087
01:04:20,125 --> 01:04:26,041
And nowadays your mind is also saying
lot of bad things, isn't it?

1088
01:04:26,083 --> 01:04:26,958
Mean?

1089
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,750
What have you told to Ronit's father?

1090
01:04:28,791 --> 01:04:30,416
What?

1091
01:04:30,458 --> 01:04:33,166
What?
Don't try to ignore it.

1092
01:04:33,208 --> 01:04:36,458
Haven't you said that we are getting married
and will go and stay at Kolkata?

1093
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:37,375
No, That's…

1094
01:04:37,416 --> 01:04:38,666
Haven't you said?
Haven't?

1095
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:40,000
No, I have not told it seriously.

1096
01:04:40,041 --> 01:04:43,166
I just wanted to check that whether he has any
objection or not? Mean just casually.

1097
01:04:43,208 --> 01:04:45,166
Casually? No,

1098
01:04:45,791 --> 01:04:47,250
it was not casual Harababu.

1099
01:04:47,291 --> 01:04:48,625
You told it seriously.

1100
01:04:48,666 --> 01:04:52,208
Even you had also told that I have agreed.

1101
01:04:53,125 --> 01:04:56,458
Shame, shame, shame,
shame Harababu!

1102
01:04:56,500 --> 01:05:00,166
This is what type of discussion?

1103
01:05:00,208 --> 01:05:03,125
Haven't you grown enough?

1104
01:05:03,166 --> 01:05:06,916
Then why this kind of childish thoughts?

1105
01:05:06,958 --> 01:05:08,750
Just remove all these
thoughts from your head.

1106
01:05:08,791 --> 01:05:10,541
And where is Rashubabu?

1107
01:05:10,583 --> 01:05:12,333
Who?
Rashubabu…

1108
01:05:12,375 --> 01:05:15,291
agent Rashubabu…
Is he coming?

1109
01:05:15,333 --> 01:05:18,291
No, he will be at Tea stall,
we will pick him up.

1110
01:05:18,333 --> 01:05:19,166
Ok, let's go…

1111
01:05:19,791 --> 01:05:21,333
Mamoni…

1112
01:05:21,375 --> 01:05:22,958
Oh, didi, you?

1113
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,541
How are you?
- Fine.

1114
01:05:24,583 --> 01:05:26,666
Who is that, khuki?

1115
01:05:26,708 --> 01:05:29,083
Oh, didi you?

1116
01:05:29,416 --> 01:05:31,416
How is your hand, fine?
- Please come, come.

1117
01:05:31,458 --> 01:05:32,750
Please come and sit inside the room.

1118
01:05:32,791 --> 01:05:34,916
No, no, no it's ok.

1119
01:05:34,958 --> 01:05:37,750
Basically that day I was so
much busy with my father,

1120
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:39,958
I was not able to get any news of here.

1121
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,958
What news didimoni?

1122
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,666
I don't send her to work anymore.

1123
01:05:43,708 --> 01:05:45,333
It is running as usual

1124
01:05:45,375 --> 01:05:50,416
But that day we all went to Banerjee house,
what was the outcome?

1125
01:05:50,458 --> 01:05:51,875
What should I say Didimoni?

1126
01:05:51,916 --> 01:05:53,916
Poor men's fate is like that.

1127
01:05:53,958 --> 01:05:55,875
They have settled down it
by providing some money.

1128
01:05:55,916 --> 01:05:56,958
Money?

1129
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,500
Settled through money means?

1130
01:05:58,541 --> 01:06:00,750
Then what about the torture
they had made on Mamoni...

1131
01:06:00,791 --> 01:06:03,750
...and the scar they had done
on her hand...

1132
01:06:03,791 --> 01:06:05,625
...and the hair they had torn?

1133
01:06:05,916 --> 01:06:08,208
Poor men's Justice!!

1134
01:06:08,250 --> 01:06:10,041
They had given 3000 rupees...

1135
01:06:10,083 --> 01:06:14,416
...from that Prasantada said to give
1000 rupees to Milton and friends...

1136
01:06:14,458 --> 01:06:16,416
...as they will have some picnic.

1137
01:06:16,458 --> 01:06:17,791
What?

1138
01:06:19,375 --> 01:06:22,750
How come Prasantada
also accepted this decision?

1139
01:06:22,791 --> 01:06:25,541
In addition, picnic?

1140
01:06:26,166 --> 01:06:28,291
This is more severe guilt.

1141
01:06:34,291 --> 01:06:35,250
Yes, tell me.

1142
01:06:35,291 --> 01:06:38,208
In this way, you have solved
the Banerjee House matter?

1143
01:06:38,250 --> 01:06:42,416
All those insult, harassment to a girl
has been repaid back in just 3000 rupees!

1144
01:06:42,458 --> 01:06:44,875
Bhumika, try to understand one thing..

1145
01:06:45,708 --> 01:06:50,333
See, If you had involved Thana and Police,
they would have bypassed it and definitely come out.

1146
01:06:50,375 --> 01:06:54,958
In spite of that a poor girl got 3000 rupees,
what's the wrong thing in it?

1147
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:56,875
Yes, just be little bit practical,
please.

1148
01:06:56,916 --> 01:06:58,041
Of course...

1149
01:06:58,083 --> 01:07:03,625
...being so much practical you people
had taken 1000 from that and had a picnic.

1150
01:07:03,666 --> 01:07:05,041
Shame Prasantada,

1151
01:07:05,083 --> 01:07:06,958
I never expected it from you.

1152
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,416
You should have forced them to beg pardon.

1153
01:07:09,458 --> 01:07:11,500
Hey, they have already asked sorry

1154
01:07:11,541 --> 01:07:13,666
Runa herself caught my hand
and begged pardon to me.

1155
01:07:13,708 --> 01:07:16,041
It's ridiculous,
why did Runa asked sorry?

1156
01:07:16,083 --> 01:07:17,166
And that even to you?

1157
01:07:17,208 --> 01:07:20,416
Banerjee and Banerjee's wife should have
begged for pardon to Mamoni.

1158
01:07:20,458 --> 01:07:22,291
If I was there, I would have done it.

1159
01:07:22,333 --> 01:07:24,541
Ok, leave it, forget it.

1160
01:07:24,583 --> 01:07:26,875
Listen, are we meeting in the afternoon?

1161
01:07:26,916 --> 01:07:29,000
There is a good movie….

1162
01:07:29,708 --> 01:07:32,708
...hello Bhumika.

1163
01:07:35,916 --> 01:07:37,083
Cut it!

1164
01:07:52,541 --> 01:07:54,333
Is this the house?

1165
01:07:54,375 --> 01:07:55,416
Yes, yes.

1166
01:07:55,458 --> 01:08:00,833
Have you seen, how much open space is there
in front of it and it is just beside the main road.

1167
01:08:00,875 --> 01:08:04,500
So, go and call the House Owner.
- Yes.

1168
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:08,500
Is your father available?

1169
01:08:08,541 --> 01:08:10,916
No, he went to the market for a while.

1170
01:08:10,958 --> 01:08:14,166
Oh, When will he return?

1171
01:08:14,208 --> 01:08:15,583
Don't know.

1172
01:08:15,625 --> 01:08:18,249
Has he told anything that when will he return?

1173
01:08:18,291 --> 01:08:19,916
No, He didn't tell that.

1174
01:08:23,541 --> 01:08:25,249
Is your mother around?

1175
01:08:27,999 --> 01:08:29,082
Yes.

1176
01:08:29,124 --> 01:08:31,416
Can you please inform...

1177
01:08:31,666 --> 01:08:33,791
Tell that Rashubabu has came.

1178
01:08:50,124 --> 01:08:51,957
Whom we have seen on the roof...

1179
01:08:52,707 --> 01:08:53,665
...who is that lady?

1180
01:08:53,707 --> 01:08:56,457
She is the only daughter of Pallabbabu.

1181
01:08:56,499 --> 01:08:58,749
What is the name…

1182
01:08:58,791 --> 01:09:00,666
…Radhika or something?

1183
01:09:00,707 --> 01:09:03,249
Quiet good looking.

1184
01:09:05,916 --> 01:09:07,749
Marriage, haven't they marry her?

1185
01:09:07,791 --> 01:09:09,749
You are able to see their condition.

1186
01:09:09,791 --> 01:09:11,666
The old time has gone.

1187
01:09:11,707 --> 01:09:17,040
At the same time, Pallabbabu's workshop
is locked out for a long time.

1188
01:09:17,082 --> 01:09:19,915
That's why, you are getting
this land in cheap rate.

1189
01:09:19,957 --> 01:09:23,249
They really need some money.

1190
01:09:25,624 --> 01:09:27,291
If someone has less money...

1191
01:09:27,957 --> 01:09:30,624
...then the temper should be low too.
Isn't it?

1192
01:09:31,874 --> 01:09:33,666
Can't get it properly?

1193
01:09:33,707 --> 01:09:35,957
You are not supposed to.

1194
01:09:36,791 --> 01:09:37,666
Leave it.

1195
01:09:37,707 --> 01:09:39,540
There is no trace of Pallabbabu.

1196
01:09:40,291 --> 01:09:42,583
Let's go and see the place by ourselves.

1197
01:09:42,624 --> 01:09:43,791
Sure.

1198
01:09:48,874 --> 01:09:54,750
If you just roam the whole land,
you can easily understand how much it is.

1199
01:09:54,791 --> 01:09:55,458
Come.

1200
01:09:59,791 --> 01:10:00,708
Leave it

1201
01:10:01,916 --> 01:10:03,666
I will not go that side.

1202
01:10:03,708 --> 01:10:05,790
Rather I am going to sit inside the car.

1203
01:10:09,416 --> 01:10:10,958
Let me go and see.

1204
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,083
Ok, let's go.

1205
01:10:18,541 --> 01:10:20,958
Hey, are you plucking the Lemons?

1206
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,166
Yes.

1207
01:10:22,208 --> 01:10:24,333
In childhood, we also had
lemon tree in our house.

1208
01:10:24,375 --> 01:10:25,958
It's like big big...

1209
01:10:26,791 --> 01:10:28,208
Big pomelos!

1210
01:10:28,666 --> 01:10:30,500
What's your name?

1211
01:10:31,083 --> 01:10:31,750
Bhumika.

1212
01:10:31,791 --> 01:10:34,291
Wow, what a nice name.

1213
01:10:35,125 --> 01:10:36,291
Do you know him?

1214
01:10:36,333 --> 01:10:39,165
He is a rich man,
named Harababu.

1215
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:44,583
Having 4 running business,
2 cars. Yes 2 Cars too.

1216
01:10:44,916 --> 01:10:46,833
Are you going to buy our house?

1217
01:10:46,875 --> 01:10:50,291
Yes, it is supposed to be like that.

1218
01:10:50,333 --> 01:10:52,040
What shall you do after
buying the house?

1219
01:10:52,083 --> 01:10:53,625
Shall you make flats?

1220
01:10:54,458 --> 01:10:57,375
May make or may not.

1221
01:10:57,791 --> 01:10:58,791
Why?

1222
01:11:00,708 --> 01:11:02,000
No,

1223
01:11:02,041 --> 01:11:03,250
basically...

1224
01:11:04,375 --> 01:11:07,250
basically Lot of my grandfather's memory
is attached with this house.

1225
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,750
Do you know my grandfather?

1226
01:11:11,791 --> 01:11:12,875
What's the name?

1227
01:11:13,166 --> 01:11:14,916
Ananta Mohan Biswas.

1228
01:11:14,958 --> 01:11:17,208
He was a clerk at Howrah Court.

1229
01:11:17,250 --> 01:11:19,291
He was a freedom fighter.

1230
01:11:19,708 --> 01:11:22,958
He fought against the British
and made our country independent.

1231
01:11:23,625 --> 01:11:26,041
Lot of his memory is
attached with this house.

1232
01:11:27,166 --> 01:11:28,750
Yes, of course.

1233
01:11:28,791 --> 01:11:30,083
It is for me like what should I say,

1234
01:11:30,125 --> 01:11:33,291
like I am buying some of
his property of that great man.

1235
01:11:33,333 --> 01:11:35,665
I am really obliged for it.
What else?

1236
01:11:35,708 --> 01:11:39,583
I have seen someone's picture
at the room with someone at the lap.

1237
01:11:39,625 --> 01:11:41,166
Is he your grandfather?

1238
01:11:41,208 --> 01:11:44,583
Yes. Can I request you one thing?

1239
01:11:44,625 --> 01:11:46,750
Yes, of course.

1240
01:11:46,791 --> 01:11:49,083
That time, lot of freedom fighters used
to come to our house.

1241
01:11:49,125 --> 01:11:50,958
They used to have meeting secretly.

1242
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:54,958
That mango tree is there and
the platform beneath that tree, right?

1243
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,416
Those freedom fighters used to sit
there and have those secret meetings.

1244
01:11:57,458 --> 01:12:00,583
Who are those people used
to come? Netaji, Khudiram.

1245
01:12:00,625 --> 01:12:02,333
Yes, yes, Deshbandhu also used to come.

1246
01:12:02,375 --> 01:12:03,750
Yes, yes, Deshbandhu came many times.

1247
01:12:03,791 --> 01:12:06,666
Wow, then he must be
a great freedom fighter.

1248
01:12:06,708 --> 01:12:09,040
Does Freedom fighters are
great or ordinary?

1249
01:12:09,083 --> 01:12:11,165
All Freedom fighters are equal.

1250
01:12:11,208 --> 01:12:17,040
All have the same fire inside them, same chant
in their lip and same dream in their eyes.

1251
01:12:17,083 --> 01:12:18,665
So I wanted to say that...

1252
01:12:18,708 --> 01:12:27,290
...if you can leave this place vacant or make
a platform properly then it would be really great.

1253
01:12:27,333 --> 01:12:33,040
This would not be possible
by my own consent.

1254
01:12:33,083 --> 01:12:34,750
I need to talk to Tamasa.

1255
01:12:34,791 --> 01:12:38,083
If you are agreed then your
wife will be agreed too.

1256
01:12:38,125 --> 01:12:40,458
Can you please make her understand?

1257
01:12:44,666 --> 01:12:48,166
She is not my wife.

1258
01:12:48,208 --> 01:12:49,165
Sorry.

1259
01:12:49,208 --> 01:12:51,375
Lot of people do the same fault.

1260
01:12:51,416 --> 01:12:54,250
She is actually my partner...

1261
01:12:54,291 --> 01:12:56,083
...means business partner.

1262
01:13:04,875 --> 01:13:05,500
Hello

1263
01:13:06,125 --> 01:13:08,125
It means you have not
saved my number right?

1264
01:13:09,875 --> 01:13:11,500
Who is speaking?

1265
01:13:11,541 --> 01:13:14,000
Basically my phone was giving
trouble for a long time.

1266
01:13:14,041 --> 01:13:15,583
A lot of contacts was deleted.

1267
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:19,208
You aren't able to recognize
my voice as well, right?

1268
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:21,541
How can I recognize the
voice through phone?

1269
01:13:21,583 --> 01:13:23,415
It's Ratul Halder speaking.

1270
01:13:27,250 --> 01:13:31,583
Oh, oh… Sorry…

1271
01:13:35,166 --> 01:13:36,750
It's a blunder.

1272
01:13:36,791 --> 01:13:38,583
Now I can able to understand.

1273
01:13:38,625 --> 01:13:39,416
Tell me.

1274
01:13:39,458 --> 01:13:41,833
No, no nothing to be sorry.

1275
01:13:41,875 --> 01:13:44,666
See, we just met each other for one day.

1276
01:13:44,708 --> 01:13:46,958
That's even for a little time.

1277
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,250
I would also do the same
mistake if I was in your place.

1278
01:13:50,208 --> 01:13:53,458
And my voice is not a baritone voice
ike Amitabh Bachchan,

1279
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:56,583
so that you can identify by only listening.

1280
01:13:58,708 --> 01:14:01,708
But your voice is quiet impressive.

1281
01:14:02,875 --> 01:14:08,250
It's not like that only
baritone voice can be identified.

1282
01:14:08,791 --> 01:14:12,000
Yes, you are told a perfect truth.

1283
01:14:12,041 --> 01:14:15,666
Comedian Kesto Mukherjee's
voice was not baritone,

1284
01:14:15,708 --> 01:14:16,958
but anyone was able to identify.

1285
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:18,333
What do you say?

1286
01:14:21,333 --> 01:14:23,040
You really talk funny.

1287
01:14:23,083 --> 01:14:25,500
You have good sense of
humor as well.

1288
01:14:25,875 --> 01:14:26,666
Thank you.

1289
01:14:26,708 --> 01:14:29,415
It would have been pleasure
if I can believe your words.

1290
01:14:29,458 --> 01:14:33,208
Why will I disbelieve?

1291
01:14:33,250 --> 01:14:35,875
Because common people believes that...

1292
01:14:35,916 --> 01:14:40,750
...Political persons are cheat, liar
and in some cases clown.

1293
01:14:40,791 --> 01:14:43,541
Whatever so, Let's come to point,

1294
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:47,250
the scheduled meeting
between you and Arjunda...

1295
01:14:47,291 --> 01:14:50,166
...on sunday at 2 PM that
has been cancelled.

1296
01:14:50,208 --> 01:14:51,208
What?

1297
01:14:51,583 --> 01:14:52,625
Yes,

1298
01:14:52,666 --> 01:14:57,125
Now another news is that I have fixed
another meeting with you...

1299
01:14:57,166 --> 01:14:59,208
...that is on sunday morning.

1300
01:14:59,250 --> 01:15:00,375
Is it so?

1301
01:15:00,958 --> 01:15:02,540
Is it so? So kind of you.

1302
01:15:02,583 --> 01:15:04,750
It appeared like a tit for tat.

1303
01:15:04,791 --> 01:15:06,791
Haa... haaa... haaa...

1304
01:15:08,708 --> 01:15:10,708
Why it would be brickbats,

1305
01:15:11,208 --> 01:15:12,250
it is a flower.

1306
01:15:12,291 --> 01:15:15,333
I would be curious to see the flower.

1307
01:15:16,041 --> 01:15:17,958
So when do we need to meet...

1308
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:19,416
...on sunday?

1309
01:15:19,458 --> 01:15:22,415
It seems that Harada can't be able
to return from Durgapore.

1310
01:15:22,458 --> 01:15:27,665
You do one thing, you come alone
at exactly 10AM in the morning.

1311
01:15:32,583 --> 01:15:33,875
Are you listening?

1312
01:15:35,541 --> 01:15:37,375
I have something to say to you.

1313
01:15:39,541 --> 01:15:40,875
Come in.

1314
01:15:44,791 --> 01:15:45,791
Tell me.

1315
01:15:46,916 --> 01:15:49,458
Are you really buying our house?

1316
01:15:52,625 --> 01:15:53,666
Why?

1317
01:15:53,708 --> 01:15:55,708
We shall not sell that house.

1318
01:15:56,166 --> 01:15:58,083
I don't want that you
would buy that house.

1319
01:15:58,125 --> 01:16:00,291
Am I supposed to do as per your wish?

1320
01:16:01,541 --> 01:16:03,083
Your father is the owner of that land.

1321
01:16:04,416 --> 01:16:06,458
Whatever I need to discuss,
I will do it with your father.

1322
01:16:06,500 --> 01:16:07,791
You may go now.

1323
01:16:08,458 --> 01:16:10,915
But both I and my mother
also stay there.

1324
01:16:11,875 --> 01:16:14,041
Does our opinion has no value?

1325
01:16:14,083 --> 01:16:15,083
No,

1326
01:16:16,375 --> 01:16:17,708
Nothing.

1327
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:22,915
You are going to stay in a new house
after selling the old house.

1328
01:16:23,916 --> 01:16:25,416
It would be better for all of you.

1329
01:16:25,458 --> 01:16:29,000
Do you know that that house
was built by my grandfather?

1330
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:32,583
My grandfather was a freedom fighter.

1331
01:16:33,125 --> 01:16:36,208
He fought for the
independence of our country.

1332
01:16:37,458 --> 01:16:40,915
There are lot of memories of
my grandfather in that house.

1333
01:16:41,291 --> 01:16:45,625
We can't leave the possession
of the house at any cost.

1334
01:16:45,666 --> 01:16:49,625
You should think of it
before taking advance.

1335
01:16:49,666 --> 01:16:50,791
Advance?

1336
01:16:51,416 --> 01:16:52,083
Yes

1337
01:16:52,125 --> 01:16:53,791
For what?

1338
01:16:55,291 --> 01:16:56,458
Mean...

1339
01:16:56,500 --> 01:16:57,458
...Money?

1340
01:16:59,125 --> 01:17:03,458
Your father has already taken a lot money
as advance from us for this house.

1341
01:17:03,500 --> 01:17:05,416
Do you know that?

1342
01:17:06,125 --> 01:17:08,416
How much has he taken?

1343
01:17:12,250 --> 01:17:15,291
Better you ask that to your father.

1344
01:17:19,958 --> 01:17:23,250
I am saying it that I will
return those money to you.

1345
01:17:23,291 --> 01:17:24,250
Please listen to me.

1346
01:17:24,291 --> 01:17:25,291
Please,

1347
01:17:27,416 --> 01:17:30,708
I do not want to discuss
anything about it.

1348
01:17:32,416 --> 01:17:33,916
You may leave now.

1349
01:17:43,916 --> 01:17:46,916
Dad, have you taken advance
for selling the house?

1350
01:17:46,958 --> 01:17:48,083
Yes, I do.

1351
01:17:48,416 --> 01:17:49,916
But what happened?

1352
01:17:49,958 --> 01:17:51,625
Is it a big deal?

1353
01:17:52,416 --> 01:17:57,333
Now I am going to market to arrange
the bread and butter for all of you...

1354
01:17:57,375 --> 01:17:58,166
...doesn't it need money?

1355
01:17:58,208 --> 01:18:01,583
But aren't you the son of the great
freedom fighter Ananta Mohan Biswas?

1356
01:18:01,625 --> 01:18:03,625
So many memories of your father
are attached with this house.

1357
01:18:03,666 --> 01:18:05,291
But still how can you talk
about selling this house?

1358
01:18:05,333 --> 01:18:06,915
Yes, I of course do that.

1359
01:18:06,958 --> 01:18:07,750
Memory?

1360
01:18:07,791 --> 01:18:10,083
Will it provide us the bread and butter?

1361
01:18:10,416 --> 01:18:13,791
What the great change happened
after the Freedom?

1362
01:18:13,833 --> 01:18:16,415
Everyone is plundering all.

1363
01:18:17,083 --> 01:18:19,333
Since the workshop had been locked out,
I am just sitting idle at home.

1364
01:18:19,375 --> 01:18:22,125
Does your Freedom fighter
grandpa come to see us?

1365
01:18:22,375 --> 01:18:24,000
Has he come to run the family?

1366
01:18:24,875 --> 01:18:26,916
When I have to take the responsibility
to run the whole family...

1367
01:18:26,958 --> 01:18:29,125
...then I would not go to give any
explanation to anyone about my deeds.

1368
01:18:29,166 --> 01:18:30,875
Dad, still I am reminding you
that you have time,

1369
01:18:30,916 --> 01:18:34,750
just return the advance as we are not going
to sell this house at any cost.

1370
01:18:34,791 --> 01:18:35,916
Shut up.

1371
01:18:35,958 --> 01:18:37,665
Don't try to teach me.

1372
01:18:38,416 --> 01:18:40,583
Grandpa! Grandpa!

1373
01:18:40,625 --> 01:18:42,791
Is your grandpa coming to feed you?

1374
01:18:42,833 --> 01:18:44,625
Arrange your marriage?
- Huh,

1375
01:18:45,333 --> 01:18:46,915
What are you doing?

1376
01:18:47,375 --> 01:18:49,041
Again you are shouting?

1377
01:18:49,875 --> 01:18:50,833
Please,

1378
01:18:50,875 --> 01:18:54,375
I beg you,
kindly please do not shout.

1379
01:18:54,416 --> 01:18:56,166
Do you think that I wish to shout?

1380
01:18:56,875 --> 01:18:59,208
It's just burn my head.

1381
01:19:00,041 --> 01:19:04,166
Do your daughter realize
that how does the family run?

1382
01:19:05,416 --> 01:19:08,083
When today there is some opportunity
to get some money,

1383
01:19:08,125 --> 01:19:10,958
suddenly your daughter is
overwhelmed with patriotism.

1384
01:19:11,500 --> 01:19:13,666
Shit of Patriotism!

1385
01:19:13,708 --> 01:19:15,750
In such a country where people
can't feed themselves...

1386
01:19:15,791 --> 01:19:17,833
...there what is the
meaning of patriotism?

1387
01:19:17,875 --> 01:19:21,500
I will definitely sale this house.

1388
01:19:22,208 --> 01:19:24,415
Bhumika! Uff!

1389
01:19:27,416 --> 01:19:28,708
No, no.

1390
01:19:30,791 --> 01:19:33,500
No, no. Uncle can't sale
that house at any cost.

1391
01:19:34,708 --> 01:19:37,500
After all a sentiment is attached.

1392
01:19:38,041 --> 01:19:40,833
That's not only yours.

1393
01:19:40,875 --> 01:19:42,666
It's our too,

1394
01:19:42,708 --> 01:19:44,540
It's our too, Bhumika.

1395
01:19:44,833 --> 01:19:48,875
Such a glorious heritage,
that can't be sold just for money?

1396
01:19:49,958 --> 01:19:51,165
No, no

1397
01:19:51,708 --> 01:19:54,250
somehow we have to stop it.

1398
01:19:54,291 --> 01:19:56,583
Prashantada...

1399
01:19:56,958 --> 01:19:59,083
Please do something.

1400
01:19:59,791 --> 01:20:06,500
I have forgot everthing and came to you.

1401
01:20:07,791 --> 01:20:12,208
I thought that perhaps you
will never see my face Bhumika.

1402
01:20:12,958 --> 01:20:15,665
What had you done with
that Banerjee's incident..

1403
01:20:16,083 --> 01:20:18,290
...and denied my phone call.

1404
01:20:20,416 --> 01:20:23,416
Really, I thought that I will
never see your face.

1405
01:20:24,625 --> 01:20:28,750
Today whole day, I have
fought a lot with myself.

1406
01:20:28,791 --> 01:20:33,833
I was not able to understand that what
should I do and whom should I go for it?

1407
01:20:33,875 --> 01:20:36,916
I was totally clueless.

1408
01:20:36,958 --> 01:20:40,375
Dad had decided to sale
the house Prasantada.

1409
01:20:40,416 --> 01:20:45,208
I am not able to resist him in any means.

1410
01:20:45,666 --> 01:20:51,208
Prasantada, please rectify your guilt today.

1411
01:20:53,833 --> 01:20:56,040
You don't know,

1412
01:20:57,041 --> 01:21:01,958
how much I respect you.

1413
01:21:03,125 --> 01:21:09,041
It would be really painful to see you
to be degraded from that place.

1414
01:21:11,916 --> 01:21:14,125
It's really painful.

1415
01:21:18,708 --> 01:21:20,583
Don't worry,

1416
01:21:22,708 --> 01:21:25,000
It will be definitely get settled.

1417
01:21:26,041 --> 01:21:29,000
What is her name you told?

1418
01:21:34,333 --> 01:21:35,540
Barui?

1419
01:21:35,583 --> 01:21:36,833
Tamasha.

1420
01:21:38,083 --> 01:21:39,415
Tamasa Barui.

1421
01:21:40,125 --> 01:21:42,583
Fine, by the way Tomorrow is Sunday right?

1422
01:21:43,625 --> 01:21:45,708
Tomorrow morning we will go to her place.

1423
01:21:51,125 --> 01:21:52,541
Arjunda

1424
01:21:53,916 --> 01:21:56,000
She is Tamasa Barui.

1425
01:21:56,583 --> 01:21:58,708
That Petrol pump…

1426
01:21:59,375 --> 01:22:01,125
Ok, ok.

1427
01:22:03,041 --> 01:22:05,083
It will be done.

1428
01:22:05,125 --> 01:22:07,000
Let me come back from Delhi.

1429
01:22:08,041 --> 01:22:09,916
Basically he is bit busy today.

1430
01:22:09,958 --> 01:22:10,625
Ok.

1431
01:22:10,666 --> 01:22:12,791
He has a flight at 2PM for Delhi.

1432
01:22:13,666 --> 01:22:17,083
Ratul, just wait for a while.
- yes,

1433
01:22:17,125 --> 01:22:18,583
You will take that order.
-yes.

1434
01:22:18,625 --> 01:22:19,916
Ok Sir.

1435
01:22:22,916 --> 01:22:25,333
Let's wait outside.

1436
01:22:28,666 --> 01:22:31,041
Raju!
- Yes, tell me.

1437
01:22:31,083 --> 01:22:33,375
Did Tamasha leave in the morning?

1438
01:22:33,416 --> 01:22:34,458
Yes.

1439
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:37,083
Exactly where, do you know?

1440
01:22:37,125 --> 01:22:39,083
It seems that she has some
important meeting.

1441
01:22:39,125 --> 01:22:40,583
Hello

1442
01:22:41,416 --> 01:22:43,083
Whom do you want?

1443
01:22:43,125 --> 01:22:46,208
We want to meet Tamasha madam.

1444
01:22:46,250 --> 01:22:47,708
But she is not at home right now.

1445
01:22:47,958 --> 01:22:50,915
If you want you can talk with her husband,
Santashil Barui.

1446
01:22:51,375 --> 01:22:52,125
Hello

1447
01:22:52,791 --> 01:22:53,541
Hello

1448
01:22:54,916 --> 01:22:57,333
Are you Tamasha madam's husband?

1449
01:22:57,375 --> 01:22:58,333
Yes.

1450
01:23:02,666 --> 01:23:04,791
Are you buying Bhumika's house?

1451
01:23:05,625 --> 01:23:07,791
See, I don't know anything about it.

1452
01:23:07,833 --> 01:23:09,583
What! You don't know anything!
Quiet surprising!

1453
01:23:09,625 --> 01:23:11,375
Your wife is buying the house and you
are saying that you don't know anything?

1454
01:23:11,416 --> 01:23:13,833
It seems that you are still hiding it.

1455
01:23:13,875 --> 01:23:14,750
Let me tell you,

1456
01:23:14,791 --> 01:23:18,875
few days back your wife and someone
named Harababu came to see our house.

1457
01:23:18,916 --> 01:23:20,208
They also gave advance for it.

1458
01:23:20,250 --> 01:23:21,666
But surprisingly you are saying
you don't know anything!

1459
01:23:21,708 --> 01:23:23,083
Is it possible? You tell me!

1460
01:23:23,125 --> 01:23:25,291
Believe me,
I don't know anything.

1461
01:23:25,333 --> 01:23:30,540
They were deciding to buy a house
but I don't know anything more.

1462
01:23:31,250 --> 01:23:32,708
Where are you from?

1463
01:23:33,125 --> 01:23:36,666
Kanthal Bagan,
It is near to the main road.

1464
01:23:36,708 --> 01:23:37,665
Ok

1465
01:23:37,916 --> 01:23:42,875
That house will never be sold.
Can you get it?

1466
01:23:43,708 --> 01:23:46,083
There was a freedom fighter
belongs to that house.

1467
01:23:46,125 --> 01:23:49,458
For that reason, the house will be
not be sold out, just inform to your wife.

1468
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:51,375
Freedom fighter?

1469
01:23:51,416 --> 01:23:54,208
Yes, Freedom fighter Ananta Biswas.
Have you heard his name?

1470
01:23:54,666 --> 01:23:55,625
Yes heard of it.

1471
01:23:55,916 --> 01:23:58,041
Great, then no issue.

1472
01:23:58,625 --> 01:24:00,458
That house will not be sold.

1473
01:24:00,500 --> 01:24:03,541
Ask your wife not to
proceed towards that house.

1474
01:24:03,583 --> 01:24:06,250
Though, she can't take
over the house.

1475
01:24:06,708 --> 01:24:09,415
As myself and my boys will
make such a chaos...

1476
01:24:10,500 --> 01:24:12,500
...that she will understand
own blunder.

1477
01:24:13,291 --> 01:24:15,958
Then both Money and house
both will be lost. Ok.

1478
01:24:16,791 --> 01:24:17,833
Let's move.

1479
01:24:18,291 --> 01:24:20,375
It looks like we have to come again.

1480
01:24:21,791 --> 01:24:23,416
So inform to your wife.

1481
01:24:24,166 --> 01:24:26,041
If she understands that's good.

1482
01:24:26,083 --> 01:24:27,625
Else we will come again.

1483
01:24:28,166 --> 01:24:32,000
But that time we will not be two,
we will have 200 people with us.

1484
01:24:38,541 --> 01:24:42,416
I told you to keep faith
on me, right?

1485
01:24:46,416 --> 01:24:47,708
Yes, I do.

1486
01:24:50,291 --> 01:24:53,666
When Arjunda has committed
then it will be definitely done.

1487
01:24:53,916 --> 01:24:55,375
Nothing to worry.

1488
01:24:57,166 --> 01:24:58,416
Thank you.

1489
01:25:00,875 --> 01:25:02,625
You are most welcome.

1490
01:25:04,958 --> 01:25:06,665
Believe me,

1491
01:25:07,125 --> 01:25:09,083
I am feeling such a great...

1492
01:25:09,125 --> 01:25:12,583
...after getting in touch with you
that I can't express.

1493
01:25:12,625 --> 01:25:16,333
In fact this has never been
happened to me. This is the first time.

1494
01:25:17,791 --> 01:25:19,458
Is it so?

1495
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:21,125
Yes, Yes.

1496
01:25:23,916 --> 01:25:27,916
Wow, you have nice fingers.

1497
01:25:28,875 --> 01:25:32,000
Generally beautiful ladies
don't have such nice fingers.

1498
01:25:34,666 --> 01:25:37,083
Then I am not beautiful.

1499
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:39,000
Is it so?

1500
01:25:40,416 --> 01:25:42,333
Did anybody tell this to you?

1501
01:25:42,791 --> 01:25:43,708
Yes.

1502
01:25:45,333 --> 01:25:46,875
A lot told.

1503
01:25:46,916 --> 01:25:48,000
Ok.

1504
01:25:49,666 --> 01:25:54,500
Then they all were women.

1505
01:26:00,208 --> 01:26:00,875
Tell me?

1506
01:26:00,916 --> 01:26:02,375
Huh! You will tell.

1507
01:26:02,416 --> 01:26:05,833
I was waiting so long for you.
Your call is not coming.

1508
01:26:05,875 --> 01:26:07,083
I got stuck in some work here.

1509
01:26:07,125 --> 01:26:08,750
Now sitting at a hotel
in Durgapur.

1510
01:26:08,791 --> 01:26:09,958
Have you visited?

1511
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:10,708
Yes.

1512
01:26:10,958 --> 01:26:13,833
Only Yes.
Tell me in details please.

1513
01:26:13,875 --> 01:26:18,083
Basically I was not able to talk much...

1514
01:26:18,125 --> 01:26:21,958
...but Ratul mainly talked in details.

1515
01:26:23,125 --> 01:26:26,208
Yes, Ratul is really a
clever guy.

1516
01:26:26,250 --> 01:26:28,583
I already informed him.

1517
01:26:28,625 --> 01:26:30,541
So what do you think?
Would it be fruitful?

1518
01:26:30,875 --> 01:26:33,291
How can I predict?

1519
01:26:33,333 --> 01:26:35,833
It seemed to me
he is very busy.

1520
01:26:35,875 --> 01:26:38,125
He was telling that he would
go to Delhi at noon...

1521
01:26:38,166 --> 01:26:42,375
...though he assured that
it will be done after coming back.

1522
01:26:42,416 --> 01:26:46,500
Had he noticed you?
Had you dressed beautifully?

1523
01:26:46,541 --> 01:26:48,166
Why will I dressed beautifully,
without any reason?

1524
01:26:48,208 --> 01:26:49,708
Without any reason!

1525
01:26:49,958 --> 01:26:52,625
You will get extra benefit
if women are well dressed.

1526
01:26:52,666 --> 01:26:55,375
But that is only applicable
for the people like you.

1527
01:26:55,416 --> 01:26:58,083
All men are like me only.

1528
01:27:01,291 --> 01:27:03,375
Ok, leave it. Bye for now.

1529
01:27:04,083 --> 01:27:05,958
Tomorrow I am coming back.

1530
01:27:21,666 --> 01:27:23,916
May I ask you one thing?

1531
01:27:25,208 --> 01:27:26,333
Yes.

1532
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:33,416
One boy and girl came
in search of you.

1533
01:27:35,333 --> 01:27:36,833
When?

1534
01:27:37,291 --> 01:27:39,958
Just after you left.

1535
01:27:42,416 --> 01:27:44,000
What did they say?

1536
01:27:44,791 --> 01:27:47,875
They said that you are
going to buy a house.

1537
01:27:49,583 --> 01:27:51,333
Yes, I do. So?

1538
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:57,416
The house belongs to
that girl and she will not sell the house.

1539
01:28:06,208 --> 01:28:08,125
How was the boy?

1540
01:28:08,166 --> 01:28:10,583
Good, having good physique.

1541
01:28:11,291 --> 01:28:13,958
You know he was very angry
and was telling that...

1542
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:17,125
...the house belongs to
one of the freedom fighters.

1543
01:28:17,166 --> 01:28:20,375
If invest money on it then
it will be all in vein...

1544
01:28:20,416 --> 01:28:24,541
...and said that they will create huge
chaos by bringing more people later.

1545
01:28:29,416 --> 01:28:31,000
Ok, threatening me!

1546
01:28:39,166 --> 01:28:42,958
You need not to worry about it.
I will manage it.

1547
01:28:53,625 --> 01:28:55,291
Huh! What happened?

1548
01:28:55,958 --> 01:28:57,500
Anything else to say?

1549
01:28:58,875 --> 01:29:01,708
Why are you buying the house?

1550
01:29:07,416 --> 01:29:09,208
What's your interest?

1551
01:29:09,250 --> 01:29:11,625
No, I was just asking
that is it to stay?

1552
01:29:12,625 --> 01:29:16,916
No, after marriage, staying so close...

1553
01:29:16,958 --> 01:29:19,583
...then it would
disturbing for all.

1554
01:29:19,625 --> 01:29:22,708
Then it would a
pressure on Ronit too.

1555
01:29:25,916 --> 01:29:28,916
Hey, listen. I am not
buying for that

1556
01:29:29,583 --> 01:29:33,875
I have different reason and
there is no need to inform you that.

1557
01:29:35,375 --> 01:29:36,250
Ok.

1558
01:29:38,625 --> 01:29:41,291
You don't need to know that.

1559
01:29:46,916 --> 01:29:47,708
Yes

1560
01:29:48,666 --> 01:29:49,833
Just get dressed?

1561
01:29:49,875 --> 01:29:50,666
Why?

1562
01:29:51,375 --> 01:29:53,625
Because you will look
more beautiful.

1563
01:29:56,291 --> 01:29:57,541
Where are you?

1564
01:29:58,125 --> 01:29:58,958
At home.

1565
01:29:59,416 --> 01:30:03,000
But it will take only 5 min to reach
to home with my winged horse.

1566
01:30:06,916 --> 01:30:10,166
What else will be better luck
for me if the prince will come...

1567
01:30:11,541 --> 01:30:14,208
...to take me with his
winged horse?

1568
01:30:15,583 --> 01:30:17,375
I am waiting.

1569
01:30:41,708 --> 01:30:46,208
Sometimes I wish to get
deep inside your eyes

1570
01:30:46,916 --> 01:30:49,500
You don't know
I don't understand too

1571
01:30:49,541 --> 01:30:51,083
Still I wish a lot.

1572
01:30:52,208 --> 01:30:54,250
Still I wish a lot.

1573
01:30:54,708 --> 01:30:59,415
Sometimes I wish to get
deep inside your eyes

1574
01:30:59,958 --> 01:31:02,540
You don't know
I don't understand too

1575
01:31:02,583 --> 01:31:04,125
Still I wish a lot.

1576
01:31:05,125 --> 01:31:07,750
It's a blow inside my heart

1577
01:31:07,791 --> 01:31:10,291
Such an attraction of Love

1578
01:31:10,333 --> 01:31:12,958
I am free
I am mad

1579
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,708
Will get wet into the
rain of freedom.

1580
01:31:17,541 --> 01:31:20,625
Your fresh gush of wind…

1581
01:31:23,666 --> 01:31:30,250
Just touching my sail with your
fresh gush of wind…

1582
01:31:30,625 --> 01:31:33,125
Break my anchor

1583
01:31:35,291 --> 01:31:38,666
I do not regret if I sink.

1584
01:31:40,916 --> 01:31:44,791
Your fresh gush of wind.

1585
01:32:06,500 --> 01:32:07,750
Dhrim tana na dhrim,

1586
01:32:07,791 --> 01:32:09,083
Max scoop, Ice cream

1587
01:32:09,125 --> 01:32:11,333
Song in Coffee Shop

1588
01:32:11,625 --> 01:32:16,250
Saying to you
O Lady, Don't be sad at all.

1589
01:32:16,791 --> 01:32:19,500
Quarrel and Crying

1590
01:32:19,541 --> 01:32:22,125
With the water of “Panipuri”

1591
01:32:22,166 --> 01:32:24,666
It's great to have hot

1592
01:32:24,708 --> 01:32:27,333
Let's get drenched in
sweet feeling.

1593
01:32:29,333 --> 01:32:32,415
Your fresh gush of wind…

1594
01:32:35,416 --> 01:32:42,000
Just touching my sail with your
fresh gush of wind…

1595
01:32:42,416 --> 01:32:44,916
Break my anchor

1596
01:32:47,083 --> 01:32:50,415
I do not regret if I sink.

1597
01:32:52,708 --> 01:32:56,165
Your fresh gush of wind.

1598
01:32:59,291 --> 01:33:00,958
Today Evening is really great…

1599
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:01,875
Ok

1600
01:33:06,583 --> 01:33:08,415
Hey! What will you take,
Tea or Coffee?

1601
01:33:47,833 --> 01:33:48,875
Dad!

1602
01:33:50,416 --> 01:33:51,291
Yes.

1603
01:33:51,625 --> 01:33:53,666
Have you seen Ratul Uncle's bike?

1604
01:33:53,708 --> 01:33:55,208
Yes, I do.

1605
01:33:55,250 --> 01:33:58,875
It's run like winged horse.
Will you buy one?

1606
01:33:59,166 --> 01:34:01,625
I don't know how to ride, Son.

1607
01:34:01,666 --> 01:34:03,541
You will learn it from Ratul Uncle.

1608
01:34:03,583 --> 01:34:05,833
He promised me to teach me.

1609
01:34:06,708 --> 01:34:07,500
Is it so?

1610
01:34:07,541 --> 01:34:11,375
He loves me very much and
gives me chocolate every day.

1611
01:34:13,208 --> 01:34:15,375
Even he loves mom too.

1612
01:34:21,541 --> 01:34:23,708
How do you know that?

1613
01:34:25,125 --> 01:34:26,916
Hey, tell me.

1614
01:34:27,583 --> 01:34:29,665
You will not tell anyone, right?

1615
01:34:29,708 --> 01:34:31,250
No, I will not tell anyone.

1616
01:34:31,291 --> 01:34:33,708
Promise?
- Promise.

1617
01:34:35,708 --> 01:34:36,875
You know dad,

1618
01:34:36,916 --> 01:34:42,041
One day I saw that Ratul uncle
had hugged and was kissing mom.

1619
01:34:42,083 --> 01:34:43,375
Mom was kissing too.

1620
01:34:44,791 --> 01:34:47,125
You will not tell anyone, right?

1621
01:34:48,250 --> 01:34:48,750
No.

1622
01:34:48,791 --> 01:34:50,708
Where are you going?

1623
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:52,250
Have some work.

1624
01:34:52,291 --> 01:34:54,000
I shall also go with you.

1625
01:34:56,083 --> 01:35:00,333
You better stay my son
else mom will scold.

1626
01:35:02,208 --> 01:35:03,125
Dad!

1627
01:35:05,416 --> 01:35:08,666
Are you mad?
Will you go to beg?

1628
01:35:08,708 --> 01:35:10,833
Why shall I be mad?

1629
01:35:12,625 --> 01:35:15,666
You are my childhood friend.

1630
01:35:15,708 --> 01:35:18,665
If you can then why not I?

1631
01:35:18,708 --> 01:35:20,165
Both of our situation is same?

1632
01:35:20,208 --> 01:35:21,500
I used to do it for my
bread and butter.

1633
01:35:21,541 --> 01:35:23,958
I too have the same need Montu.

1634
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:27,041
Don't talk rubbish. You have
enough money to die in peace.

1635
01:35:27,083 --> 01:35:29,915
That does not belong to me,
it's my wife's money.

1636
01:35:29,958 --> 01:35:32,375
Both are the same.

1637
01:35:32,708 --> 01:35:34,000
No, not the same.

1638
01:35:35,916 --> 01:35:38,583
Nothing I have done in my life.

1639
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:40,833
Is it a life?

1640
01:35:41,250 --> 01:35:45,625
Failure as a son,
failure as a husband,

1641
01:35:47,958 --> 01:35:50,458
even failure as a father too.

1642
01:35:50,500 --> 01:35:53,916
Just give me a chance to
redeem myself.

1643
01:35:55,250 --> 01:35:58,708
You will see that I can
successfully do the begging.

1644
01:35:59,416 --> 01:36:02,875
I don't have anything else.

1645
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:14,125
Have it.

1646
01:36:14,166 --> 01:36:16,833
Light juice,
you will not have any trouble.

1647
01:36:17,625 --> 01:36:20,583
This is totally fresh fish.

1648
01:36:20,916 --> 01:36:23,541
You know when I bought it,
it was alive.

1649
01:36:25,291 --> 01:36:28,000
I would have eaten
if it was dead also.

1650
01:37:13,166 --> 01:37:13,708
Shit!

1651
01:37:21,125 --> 01:37:22,875
What happened?
Why are you standing?

1652
01:37:22,916 --> 01:37:24,375
Please be seated.

1653
01:37:28,166 --> 01:37:30,291
For whom are you
dressing so much?

1654
01:37:31,875 --> 01:37:33,416
Don't you know?

1655
01:37:34,875 --> 01:37:36,416
Everything for you.

1656
01:37:37,875 --> 01:37:39,291
Huh, for you?

1657
01:37:39,333 --> 01:37:41,458
So long I used to think like that.

1658
01:37:41,500 --> 01:37:44,375
But now I realized that some more
lucky people are there surrounding me.

1659
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:48,833
You know Harababu,

1660
01:37:49,125 --> 01:37:51,791
own fate and other's character...

1661
01:37:52,708 --> 01:37:54,000
...always seem to be bad.

1662
01:37:56,291 --> 01:37:57,625
When is MP returning back?

1663
01:37:58,416 --> 01:38:00,000
What is your Ratul is saying?

1664
01:38:00,875 --> 01:38:03,375
Why Ratul will be mine?

1665
01:38:04,208 --> 01:38:05,833
Ratul is yours.

1666
01:38:06,916 --> 01:38:09,166
Will it be a right decision to
leave everything on them?

1667
01:38:09,208 --> 01:38:14,250
They are political person. We should
keep some update by ourselves.

1668
01:38:14,625 --> 01:38:16,083
Have you brought the car?

1669
01:38:16,125 --> 01:38:17,500
Yes, Why?

1670
01:38:19,208 --> 01:38:20,833
Come with me.

1671
01:38:20,875 --> 01:38:22,166
Where?

1672
01:38:22,833 --> 01:38:26,290
To someone's house.
The guy is jobless.

1673
01:38:26,833 --> 01:38:28,125
I shall offer him a job.

1674
01:38:28,166 --> 01:38:30,291
Where are you kidding all time?

1675
01:38:30,333 --> 01:38:32,290
I am not kidding at all.

1676
01:38:32,333 --> 01:38:34,250
Please come with me,
you will understand.

1677
01:38:34,291 --> 01:38:36,541
Where is job that you will offer?

1678
01:38:36,583 --> 01:38:38,290
Has Ratul told anything?

1679
01:38:38,333 --> 01:38:41,290
Uff, how is Ratul coming into it?

1680
01:38:41,333 --> 01:38:42,500
No, how can I say.

1681
01:38:42,541 --> 01:38:46,333
May be the guy has requested
you and you requested Ratul.

1682
01:38:47,833 --> 01:38:50,375
Listen, that guy came
to my house last night.

1683
01:38:50,416 --> 01:38:52,541
You don't try to
possess that house.

1684
01:38:52,583 --> 01:38:55,333
Hey, don't speak with anger.

1685
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,208
100 times I will do.
I must.

1686
01:38:58,916 --> 01:39:00,791
Don't you feel shame?

1687
01:39:00,833 --> 01:39:03,333
You are going to destroy the house
and memory of a freedom fighter...

1688
01:39:03,375 --> 01:39:04,500
...just cost of money.

1689
01:39:04,541 --> 01:39:08,833
Oh! So you have taken the sacred
responsibility to protect that memory.

1690
01:39:08,875 --> 01:39:10,625
What's your interest?

1691
01:39:10,666 --> 01:39:12,041
What's the relation between
you and that girl?

1692
01:39:12,083 --> 01:39:14,083
That's none of your business.

1693
01:39:14,125 --> 01:39:16,500
Just want to convey this
that if you at all try to...

1694
01:39:16,541 --> 01:39:18,333
...occupy that house then
there will be bloodshed.

1695
01:39:18,375 --> 01:39:20,166
Why will you take the
initiative to go to him?

1696
01:39:20,208 --> 01:39:23,415
Doesn't he get indulged?
Call and let him come.

1697
01:39:24,875 --> 01:39:25,833
Hmm

1698
01:39:27,291 --> 01:39:28,625
Not a bad idea.

1699
01:39:30,125 --> 01:39:34,333
I am takeing this suggestion
from you Harababu.

1700
01:39:35,083 --> 01:39:37,333
I never suggest wrong Tamasha.

1701
01:39:40,916 --> 01:39:49,583
Tamasha, you are already well dressed
so let's go somewhere nearby.

1702
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:51,958
Are you mad?

1703
01:39:52,333 --> 01:39:53,833
Why? Let's go please.

1704
01:39:54,708 --> 01:39:57,625
So Tamasha, you have
not forgotten me, right?

1705
01:39:58,875 --> 01:40:00,000
See Harababu.

1706
01:40:00,625 --> 01:40:04,000
None of you and I have the
age to play childish.

1707
01:40:05,166 --> 01:40:06,250
Leave my hand.

1708
01:40:06,291 --> 01:40:07,375
No I will not.

1709
01:40:07,416 --> 01:40:08,625
Please leave.

1710
01:40:11,208 --> 01:40:12,833
Harababu what are you doing?

1711
01:40:12,875 --> 01:40:15,541
Please leave, leave it.

1712
01:40:20,208 --> 01:40:22,708
Harababu, Did I hurt you?

1713
01:40:23,166 --> 01:40:24,166
Sorry...

1714
01:40:26,916 --> 01:40:28,416
Please get up.

1715
01:40:28,916 --> 01:40:32,791
What a childish thing
you always do.

1716
01:40:37,250 --> 01:40:39,166
This place has been swelled up.

1717
01:40:39,791 --> 01:40:43,666
Do you need some rest?

1718
01:40:52,666 --> 01:40:54,333
No, I am fine.

1719
01:40:56,791 --> 01:40:58,625
I can understand Tamasha...

1720
01:41:00,083 --> 01:41:02,708
...but can't resist my mind.

1721
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,625
Do you both frequently visit that place?

1722
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:11,125
Where?

1723
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:17,125
In that hotel where you and
Ratul went yesterday night.

1724
01:41:18,875 --> 01:41:19,791
Me?

1725
01:41:21,333 --> 01:41:22,583
Yes, You.

1726
01:41:23,916 --> 01:41:29,166
You and Ratul just left on
bike in front my eyes.

1727
01:41:29,416 --> 01:41:30,583
No, Harababu.

1728
01:41:31,625 --> 01:41:33,625
You observed wrong.

1729
01:41:33,916 --> 01:41:36,000
I had not even met
Ratul yesterday.

1730
01:41:38,791 --> 01:41:42,250
It seems that you had noticed
someone else Harababu.

1731
01:41:44,375 --> 01:41:45,791
Someone else?

1732
01:41:49,083 --> 01:41:50,125
What else?

1733
01:41:50,166 --> 01:41:54,666
Harababu, it seems that you are
getting old and not able to see properly.

1734
01:41:54,708 --> 01:41:57,250
Instead of me you saw someone else.

1735
01:41:57,291 --> 01:41:58,250
Oh.

1736
01:42:03,833 --> 01:42:07,000
Harababu, do you have some tea?

1737
01:42:09,541 --> 01:42:11,083
No, thank you.

1738
01:42:14,833 --> 01:42:16,583
Let me leave.

1739
01:42:20,666 --> 01:42:21,791
Prasantababu...

1740
01:42:23,375 --> 01:42:24,541
Prasantababu...

1741
01:42:26,416 --> 01:42:27,708
Prasantababu...

1742
01:42:34,083 --> 01:42:35,333
What happened?

1743
01:42:35,625 --> 01:42:39,708
Madam means Mrs. Tamasa Barui
has asked you to come once.

1744
01:42:40,666 --> 01:42:42,958
Tamasa Barui? Why?

1745
01:42:43,583 --> 01:42:48,208
She has told you to meet
once tomorrow morning.

1746
01:42:49,333 --> 01:42:51,833
Has Tamasa Barui asked me to meet?

1747
01:42:52,416 --> 01:42:54,583
Why did she want to meet me?

1748
01:42:54,625 --> 01:42:57,625
Perhaps both of us need it.

1749
01:42:58,500 --> 01:43:02,708
But your need is more than me.

1750
01:43:03,166 --> 01:43:04,916
Tell me, what do you want to say?

1751
01:43:06,708 --> 01:43:11,290
You have to ignore that house.

1752
01:43:11,916 --> 01:43:13,000
Absurd

1753
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,958
Impossible. If you try thousand times
then also you can't.

1754
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,208
Because I committed to Bhumika.

1755
01:43:20,958 --> 01:43:23,583
But if you have to do it for Bhumika?

1756
01:43:23,625 --> 01:43:24,416
Mean?

1757
01:43:25,416 --> 01:43:28,541
It's because you love Bhumika.

1758
01:43:28,583 --> 01:43:30,915
You will also marry her in future.

1759
01:43:31,791 --> 01:43:35,250
But see, you don't have
any earning...

1760
01:43:35,875 --> 01:43:39,625
...and in simple words
you are totally unemployed.

1761
01:43:40,375 --> 01:43:43,833
Ok, you tell me why shall
Bhumika's parent give their daughter...

1762
01:43:43,875 --> 01:43:45,583
...to someone who is jobless?

1763
01:43:45,625 --> 01:43:47,875
Ok, leave it.
Let them decide it.

1764
01:43:47,916 --> 01:43:49,625
No, no Prasanta...

1765
01:43:49,666 --> 01:43:52,791
you also need to think about it.

1766
01:43:52,833 --> 01:43:57,125
See Prasanta, they will get a
lot of money after selling the house.

1767
01:43:57,166 --> 01:43:59,958
Then they will find
some proper match.

1768
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,750
What will you do then?

1769
01:44:01,791 --> 01:44:04,583
Do you roam like Devdas in love?

1770
01:44:05,416 --> 01:44:06,708
Aha! What are you doing!

1771
01:44:08,666 --> 01:44:12,208
I have different kind of mutual
understanding with Bhumika you leave it.

1772
01:44:12,250 --> 01:44:13,583
You will not understand that.

1773
01:44:13,625 --> 01:44:15,791
I don't want to understand.

1774
01:44:15,833 --> 01:44:19,208
Prasanta, I don't.
It is enough if you understand.

1775
01:44:19,500 --> 01:44:21,625
But you know Prasanta...

1776
01:44:21,666 --> 01:44:25,125
Life never runs on understanding.

1777
01:44:27,500 --> 01:44:31,375
The world is a very tough place.

1778
01:44:32,583 --> 01:44:42,583
To run it money is needed and
I shall arrange that money for you.

1779
01:44:43,958 --> 01:44:47,415
You will see that your life
will change overnight.

1780
01:44:48,541 --> 01:44:52,000
But yes, that's not a bribe.

1781
01:44:52,833 --> 01:44:55,250
That's a settlement
for your betterment.

1782
01:44:59,416 --> 01:45:02,916
You can not run your life on the
basis of the commission...

1783
01:45:03,166 --> 01:45:05,958
...by rowdy-ism or hooliganism.

1784
01:45:07,583 --> 01:45:11,790
Will you not think
about your future, tell me?

1785
01:45:12,708 --> 01:45:16,333
You have to also take
her's responsibility right?

1786
01:45:33,708 --> 01:45:40,000
Suppose, you would get a good job
and salary is also quiet good.

1787
01:45:41,166 --> 01:45:43,958
Then how will you feel Prasanta?

1788
01:45:44,791 --> 01:45:46,500
What? Job?

1789
01:45:49,125 --> 01:45:50,541
What kind of job?

1790
01:45:50,583 --> 01:45:52,583
In a Petrol pump.
The Job of a manager.

1791
01:45:57,416 --> 01:45:58,791
Manager?

1792
01:46:01,500 --> 01:46:02,333
What's the salary?

1793
01:46:04,250 --> 01:46:05,541
What do you think?

1794
01:46:06,166 --> 01:46:07,500
How much it should be?

1795
01:46:12,708 --> 01:46:13,958
Minimum 10 thousands.

1796
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,708
Wrong. 15 Thousands.

1797
01:46:17,625 --> 01:46:18,500
Agreed?

1798
01:46:18,541 --> 01:46:19,500
15 thousand?

1799
01:46:19,541 --> 01:46:20,125
Yes,

1800
01:46:20,791 --> 01:46:25,500
15 Thousands and we are going
to make the petrol pump...

1801
01:46:25,541 --> 01:46:27,208
...in place of that house Prasanta.

1802
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:31,291
And you will be the manager
of that petrol pump.

1803
01:46:32,416 --> 01:46:35,541
Just take this one month advance.

1804
01:46:35,583 --> 01:46:37,290
15 thousand rupees.

1805
01:46:37,333 --> 01:46:39,708
What are thinking?
Just keep in your pocket.

1806
01:46:44,833 --> 01:46:46,250
So Prasanta...

1807
01:46:48,208 --> 01:46:49,208
...can we relax now?

1808
01:46:53,500 --> 01:46:54,625
Yes, 100%.

1809
01:46:55,500 --> 01:46:56,958
You can just stay cool.

1810
01:46:57,666 --> 01:47:00,666
You make the pump.
Nobody will obstruct you.

1811
01:47:00,708 --> 01:47:01,708
I am with you.

1812
01:47:09,833 --> 01:47:11,333
What are you doing?

1813
01:47:11,375 --> 01:47:13,125
No, nothing much.

1814
01:47:13,166 --> 01:47:15,666
Wow, what are those things?

1815
01:47:15,708 --> 01:47:18,790
Those are my various reports.

1816
01:47:19,666 --> 01:47:21,125
Ok, take sit.
Have to say something.

1817
01:47:21,958 --> 01:47:23,208
No, no, you sit.

1818
01:47:23,250 --> 01:47:24,500
Hey, please sit.

1819
01:47:27,708 --> 01:47:29,415
What I was saying,

1820
01:47:41,416 --> 01:47:44,166
I have a complaint against you.

1821
01:47:44,208 --> 01:47:45,375
Complaint?
- Yes.

1822
01:47:45,416 --> 01:47:46,541
About what?

1823
01:47:47,583 --> 01:47:50,333
Keep close watch to
your wife's activities.

1824
01:47:50,958 --> 01:47:52,790
After all you are her husband.

1825
01:47:52,833 --> 01:47:55,708
Why shall you just leave your rights?

1826
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:57,375
Just for example,

1827
01:47:57,416 --> 01:47:59,958
if the house wife used to roam
with someone else...

1828
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,208
...then won't it create
bad reputation in the society?

1829
01:48:02,250 --> 01:48:05,791
Yes, I also used to chat with Tamasha.

1830
01:48:06,666 --> 01:48:08,458
Discussion about the business.

1831
01:48:08,500 --> 01:48:11,666
Will anybody can claim that
they have seen us in any hotel?

1832
01:48:11,916 --> 01:48:13,958
Where will you get a hotel here?

1833
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,666
Go to the high road,

1834
01:48:16,708 --> 01:48:19,165
you can see a series of hotels.

1835
01:48:19,583 --> 01:48:22,500
But all those are for enjoyment.

1836
01:48:26,375 --> 01:48:27,958
Ok, doesn't that guy
Ratul come daily?

1837
01:48:30,375 --> 01:48:33,375
Not daily exactly.
Sometimes comes.

1838
01:48:33,416 --> 01:48:35,333
Now you are doing ignorance.

1839
01:48:35,375 --> 01:48:38,666
It's hard to understand whether
you are straight or complex person.

1840
01:48:38,708 --> 01:48:42,375
No, no. I have no complex.

1841
01:48:42,416 --> 01:48:44,500
That day I have simply told couple
of words with straight heart,

1842
01:48:44,541 --> 01:48:45,750
but you understood me wrongly.

1843
01:48:45,791 --> 01:48:46,500
When?

1844
01:48:46,541 --> 01:48:47,375
When!

1845
01:48:47,416 --> 01:48:48,500
It was that day,

1846
01:48:48,541 --> 01:48:50,333
That day, I told you both of
us are getting married?

1847
01:48:50,375 --> 01:48:51,166
Yes.

1848
01:48:51,708 --> 01:48:55,125
I was kidding. Just a fun.

1849
01:48:55,166 --> 01:48:58,125
Why shall I go to marry your wife
without any means?

1850
01:48:58,166 --> 01:49:01,375
I think that day you took it
serious and told to Tamasha.

1851
01:49:01,416 --> 01:49:04,708
Now, Tamasha have scolded me.

1852
01:49:06,791 --> 01:49:08,875
You please forgive me Santoshilbabu.

1853
01:49:08,916 --> 01:49:11,708
Who am I to forgive you?

1854
01:49:13,541 --> 01:49:16,375
Ok, Can you tell me why
are you so much simple.

1855
01:49:16,416 --> 01:49:18,916
This is not at all useful to be
such a good person.

1856
01:49:18,958 --> 01:49:23,208
Try to control your wife
and also keep watching Ratul.

1857
01:49:23,875 --> 01:49:24,750
Madam is calling you.

1858
01:49:24,791 --> 01:49:25,625
Hey you go.

1859
01:49:43,375 --> 01:49:46,083
There is a great news,
I got a job.

1860
01:49:46,125 --> 01:49:47,166
Really?

1861
01:49:47,208 --> 01:49:49,958
Of course.
Owner herself has given a job.

1862
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,333
You know, she has also given me
one month salary in advance.

1863
01:49:52,375 --> 01:49:54,166
15000 rupees!

1864
01:49:55,541 --> 01:49:56,916
15000 rupees?

1865
01:49:56,958 --> 01:49:58,375
What are you saying Prasantada?

1866
01:49:58,416 --> 01:49:59,541
Yes. Now tell me

1867
01:49:59,583 --> 01:50:00,915
I am quite capable in regards
to present market right?

1868
01:50:00,958 --> 01:50:03,665
Have you heard that someone
called and offered job to someone?

1869
01:50:03,708 --> 01:50:07,875
And it is not any small post job,
rather Managerial job.

1870
01:50:07,916 --> 01:50:09,250
Managerial job?

1871
01:50:09,291 --> 01:50:09,916
Yes.

1872
01:50:10,166 --> 01:50:12,875
Then nowadays I need to
call you as Mr. Manager.

1873
01:50:12,916 --> 01:50:13,875
Isn't so?

1874
01:50:14,541 --> 01:50:16,541
Prasantada, which company?

1875
01:50:16,583 --> 01:50:18,375
It's not a company.
Petrol pump.

1876
01:50:18,416 --> 01:50:22,041
Listen, apart from my monthly salary
my owner has promised to give me...

1877
01:50:22,083 --> 01:50:27,165
...extra commission on those sales
where receipt will not be provided.

1878
01:50:27,208 --> 01:50:29,083
So who is that kind owner?

1879
01:50:30,416 --> 01:50:33,666
It's Tamasha Barui.

1880
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:35,666
Tamasha Barui!

1881
01:50:36,416 --> 01:50:38,291
That lady?

1882
01:50:40,250 --> 01:50:42,916
So why is she opening a
petrol pump all on a sudden?

1883
01:50:42,958 --> 01:50:44,915
No, it's not suddenly.

1884
01:50:45,166 --> 01:50:48,375
She had a plan that
we didn't know.

1885
01:50:48,416 --> 01:50:50,333
What didn't we know?

1886
01:50:51,708 --> 01:50:56,165
I mean, she is buying your house.

1887
01:50:58,083 --> 01:51:01,125
Afterwards she will open
a petrol pump in that place.

1888
01:51:01,500 --> 01:51:02,708
Prasantada?

1889
01:51:05,916 --> 01:51:11,250
Believe me Bhumika,
I had no other option.

1890
01:51:14,666 --> 01:51:18,125
See, I am getting old but
having not a single job.

1891
01:51:21,791 --> 01:51:22,958
See Bhumika...

1892
01:51:24,625 --> 01:51:27,583
...we also need think
about our future, right?

1893
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,625
Bhumika, at the same time
my mother is not well.

1894
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,416
You know well about the current
scenario to get a job.

1895
01:51:40,166 --> 01:51:42,500
See, we both are getting old.

1896
01:51:45,208 --> 01:51:49,415
Bhumika, Bhumika just leave
all those old sentiments.

1897
01:51:50,625 --> 01:51:52,958
Bhumika, Try to be little bit practical.

1898
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,791
You see, if the house gets sold out
then you all will also get a lot of money.

1899
01:51:55,833 --> 01:51:57,540
You people can stay well.

1900
01:51:57,583 --> 01:51:59,415
Tell me, isn't will that be good?

1901
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,541
See, I will get a job Bhumika.

1902
01:52:04,375 --> 01:52:06,500
Bhumika, why are you silent?

1903
01:52:09,708 --> 01:52:11,958
I love you Bhumika

1904
01:52:14,375 --> 01:52:16,791
believe me I really love you.

1905
01:52:18,416 --> 01:52:19,416
Believe me...

1906
01:52:40,625 --> 01:52:41,791
Traitor!

1907
01:53:01,708 --> 01:53:05,540
You,
you are exactly right Grandpa.

1908
01:53:05,583 --> 01:53:07,415
He is a traitor.

1909
01:53:07,666 --> 01:53:10,625
I have no relation with him.

1910
01:53:11,416 --> 01:53:13,000
No relation, no relation.

1911
01:53:22,791 --> 01:53:23,916
Hey, what?

1912
01:53:24,416 --> 01:53:26,250
Why are sitting in dark?

1913
01:53:27,500 --> 01:53:29,291
Are you feeling well?

1914
01:53:31,541 --> 01:53:32,708
Yes, fine.

1915
01:53:33,583 --> 01:53:34,415
Listen

1916
01:53:35,708 --> 01:53:39,583
Will you go tomorrow to
see the house?

1917
01:53:41,583 --> 01:53:44,958
Small but the southern
side is open.

1918
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:46,333
Rent is also low.

1919
01:53:47,500 --> 01:53:49,833
If you agree,
I shall finalize the deal.

1920
01:53:50,250 --> 01:53:51,541
Will you go?

1921
01:53:55,166 --> 01:53:55,708
No.

1922
01:53:59,375 --> 01:54:01,291
My son, don't be so rigid.

1923
01:54:02,250 --> 01:54:05,666
You have grown up now,
please try to understand.

1924
01:54:25,333 --> 01:54:28,790
Ok, tell me except you
who else do we have?

1925
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,291
What I am thinking you know...

1926
01:54:32,333 --> 01:54:36,375
after getting the money I shall
start a business for Prasanta.

1927
01:54:36,416 --> 01:54:38,833
Then we will give your marriage.

1928
01:54:39,500 --> 01:54:42,041
Prasantada has already
got a job Dad.

1929
01:54:42,083 --> 01:54:43,875
Got it? Where?

1930
01:54:45,416 --> 01:54:47,125
In a Petrol pump.

1931
01:54:48,416 --> 01:54:53,875
Those people who are buying our house
will make a petrol pump here.

1932
01:54:54,333 --> 01:54:54,958
Ok.

1933
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:58,875
And Prasantada will be the
manager of that petrol pump.

1934
01:54:58,916 --> 01:55:01,416
Wow, That great.

1935
01:55:02,416 --> 01:55:06,666
Then you should have fun,
instead you are sitting in a dark face.

1936
01:55:10,708 --> 01:55:13,833
I heard that whole day you have
not eaten any food.

1937
01:55:15,541 --> 01:55:17,625
Tell me, what happened my son?

1938
01:55:19,125 --> 01:55:22,083
Dad, my eyes are getting
irritated for the light.

1939
01:55:22,500 --> 01:55:25,083
Can you please put out the light?

1940
01:57:34,500 --> 01:57:36,375
It's quiet surprising!

1941
01:57:36,416 --> 01:57:41,166
Whenever I am calling Ratul,
his phone is coming engaged.

1942
01:57:41,416 --> 01:57:44,541
You are trying to
contact Ratul, right?

1943
01:57:47,500 --> 01:57:49,083
You can't reach him.

1944
01:58:00,125 --> 01:58:04,416
You will never be able to
contact him.

1945
01:58:10,291 --> 01:58:13,166
You will feel bad
if you listen the reason.

1946
01:58:15,666 --> 01:58:17,416
Though it's bad,

1947
01:58:18,416 --> 01:58:19,500
you tell me.

1948
01:58:19,791 --> 01:58:21,125
So you came.

1949
01:58:22,916 --> 01:58:24,333
Hope you got the news.

1950
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:27,625
If you had decided to own
the Pump under your name...

1951
01:58:28,583 --> 01:58:31,708
...then why you harassed us by
giving false impression so long.

1952
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,666
See Harada, I am a political person.

1953
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:36,958
I can change anytime.

1954
01:58:38,333 --> 01:58:40,958
At the same time, I also need
to see my own interest, right?

1955
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:44,125
But you should haven't
cheated Tamasha.

1956
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:50,916
You too can just make fun Harada.

1957
01:58:50,958 --> 01:58:52,958
Are you saying it cheating?

1958
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:56,041
It seems like your Tamasha
is so much innocent?

1959
01:58:56,083 --> 01:58:57,833
She is a spoilt women.

1960
01:58:57,875 --> 01:58:59,708
I know everything.

1961
01:59:00,666 --> 01:59:03,500
Tell me, how many
people have been spoilt around her?

1962
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
You are also one of them.

1963
01:59:07,958 --> 01:59:11,165
Everyone is enjoying when
its my time you called it cheating?

1964
01:59:11,416 --> 01:59:13,375
Just imagine,
what a figure in this age!

1965
01:59:13,416 --> 01:59:14,916
Hard to believe!

1966
01:59:14,958 --> 01:59:17,415
Who will say that she has a son?

1967
01:59:17,958 --> 01:59:23,375
Some one like her will come to me by own
self and I will leave her, Is it possible?

1968
01:59:23,416 --> 01:59:26,000
If you were in my place,
could you leave her?

1969
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:44,625
Disgusting, i don't believe
that Ratul will do like this...

1970
01:59:52,916 --> 01:59:58,125
Save…Save…

1971
02:00:00,833 --> 02:00:02,790
Come….Come to me….

1972
02:00:12,916 --> 02:00:14,875
Where had you kept those plates?

1973
02:00:15,791 --> 02:00:16,875
Inside the Bag.

1974
02:00:16,916 --> 02:00:19,000
If your wife gets to know about it,
I will be finished.

1975
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:24,583
Listen, What I taught.
Just do exactly the same.

1976
02:00:24,916 --> 02:00:25,750
Yes.

1977
02:00:25,791 --> 02:00:27,666
They will kill if you
will get caught.

1978
02:00:27,708 --> 02:00:30,500
Why shall I get caught?
Those plates are mine.

1979
02:00:30,541 --> 02:00:34,416
Ok, fine. Get down in
the next station.

1980
02:00:35,166 --> 02:00:36,583
Then take the left and
in a bit distance,

1981
02:00:36,625 --> 02:00:38,291
you can see Roypara.

1982
02:00:38,333 --> 02:00:41,500
Those people are quiet rich.
You can earn good.

1983
02:00:41,958 --> 02:00:42,958
Ok Montu

1984
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:48,833
while returning back I will return these
clothes and will wear own clothes.

1985
02:00:48,875 --> 02:00:50,291
Ok fine. Go.

1986
02:00:52,125 --> 02:00:53,875
No worries, go.

1987
02:01:04,958 --> 02:01:06,708
Get up my son, get up.

1988
02:01:10,125 --> 02:01:12,791
Don't give trouble to this old man.

1989
02:01:13,708 --> 02:01:15,665
Listen to me.

1990
02:01:17,125 --> 02:01:21,333
She is sitting here since last night,
have not eaten anything.

1991
02:01:21,625 --> 02:01:23,583
Not even water.

1992
02:01:24,791 --> 02:01:29,625
My daughter will die.
Please do something.

1993
02:01:29,875 --> 02:01:31,833
I can't take it anymore.

1994
02:01:33,416 --> 02:01:35,375
Tell me, what can I do now?

1995
02:01:35,958 --> 02:01:38,290
I have taken the money.
Now I have nothing to do.

1996
02:01:38,333 --> 02:01:40,083
Return that money.

1997
02:01:40,125 --> 02:01:41,583
What?
- Yes

1998
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
you return that money.

1999
02:01:44,291 --> 02:01:46,125
You know your
daughter very well.

2000
02:01:46,166 --> 02:01:49,833
She will die without having any food
but will not get up from here.

2001
02:01:50,083 --> 02:01:53,165
Is that the money is more
important than your daughter?

2002
02:01:53,666 --> 02:01:54,708
Never.

2003
02:01:56,708 --> 02:02:01,000
Whatever I did that just
for her betterment.

2004
02:02:01,791 --> 02:02:03,541
Only for her sake.

2005
02:02:03,875 --> 02:02:05,708
Just for her future.

2006
02:02:07,625 --> 02:02:10,791
If she will not be with us
then money means nothing?

2007
02:02:10,833 --> 02:02:12,875
I will go right away

2008
02:02:20,083 --> 02:02:21,625
Get up my son.
Get up.

2009
02:02:21,958 --> 02:02:23,415
Now eat something.

2010
02:02:24,083 --> 02:02:26,540
You already saw that
your father went...

2011
02:02:27,333 --> 02:02:30,375
...and now he will definitely
settle it down in some way.

2012
02:02:30,416 --> 02:02:31,416
Get up.

2013
02:02:31,791 --> 02:02:33,625
Don't sit here in this way.

2014
02:02:33,666 --> 02:02:35,791
Get up and please eat something.

2015
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:40,541
My Son, don't finish
yourself in this way.

2016
02:02:48,583 --> 02:02:51,290
Mom...

2017
02:02:53,708 --> 02:02:56,915
Mom, I am very much ill.

2018
02:02:57,416 --> 02:02:59,375
Can you please give me
some money?

2019
02:03:05,291 --> 02:03:07,083
God bless you.

2020
02:03:12,583 --> 02:03:13,415
Mam...

2021
02:03:14,583 --> 02:03:17,500
Can you please give
me some money mam?

2022
02:03:18,375 --> 02:03:19,125
No go!

2023
02:03:23,291 --> 02:03:24,791
No, no Harababu.

2024
02:03:25,166 --> 02:03:29,875
When I have not got that pump,
what's the use of that land?

2025
02:03:32,333 --> 02:03:33,125
No

2026
02:03:35,083 --> 02:03:37,000
I shall not buy that house.

2027
02:03:39,541 --> 02:03:41,500
Whatever money had spent yet,
let it go.

2028
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,333
I shall not waste any
more money for it.

2029
02:03:46,375 --> 02:03:47,750
No, no Harababu

2030
02:03:47,791 --> 02:03:50,083
I have no plan to make flats.

2031
02:03:51,708 --> 02:03:52,583
Leave it.

2032
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:53,666
Bye.

2033
02:03:54,791 --> 02:03:55,375
Madam…

2034
02:04:02,166 --> 02:04:03,625
What? Tell me.

2035
02:04:03,916 --> 02:04:05,000
Need to talk with you.

2036
02:04:09,125 --> 02:04:11,208
There is some complexity
with that land madam.

2037
02:04:11,250 --> 02:04:13,541
You can't buy that one right now.

2038
02:04:13,583 --> 02:04:17,625
He has told that he will return the
Advance what he has taken previously.

2039
02:04:17,666 --> 02:04:19,875
Just requested for few more day.

2040
02:04:20,416 --> 02:04:21,375
How many days?

2041
02:04:21,416 --> 02:04:23,166
Just 15 days.

2042
02:04:23,958 --> 02:04:27,415
Basically the person has
got into some trouble.

2043
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:28,833
What kind of?

2044
02:04:28,875 --> 02:04:31,500
His daughter is annoying
and saying that...

2045
02:04:31,541 --> 02:04:33,625
...she will not permit to
sell the house.

2046
02:04:33,666 --> 02:04:34,583
That Girl?

2047
02:04:34,625 --> 02:04:36,166
Yes, Bhumika.

2048
02:04:36,208 --> 02:04:37,415
Very arrogant girl.

2049
02:04:37,708 --> 02:04:40,540
She sat for starvation to protect
the house to save her...

2050
02:04:40,583 --> 02:04:43,250
...Grandpa's memory from destruction.

2051
02:04:49,666 --> 02:04:51,500
Who has hosted the Flag?

2052
02:04:52,916 --> 02:04:57,416
I thought that some illiterate servant
or little boy had done it.

2053
02:04:58,666 --> 02:05:01,625
My grandpa was a freedom fighter.

2054
02:05:03,416 --> 02:05:05,416
We will not sell that house.

2055
02:05:05,666 --> 02:05:08,166
I don't want you
to buy that house.

2056
02:05:12,625 --> 02:05:14,000
Madam, then?

2057
02:05:20,708 --> 02:05:21,665
Listen

2058
02:05:22,083 --> 02:05:25,250
neither I will not take back that
money nor will give any more time.

2059
02:05:25,291 --> 02:05:27,708
I must need that house.

2060
02:05:29,125 --> 02:05:30,583
Where is her father right now?

2061
02:05:30,625 --> 02:05:32,416
At home.
With his daughter.

2062
02:05:32,708 --> 02:05:34,958
You just bring him here right now.

2063
02:05:35,333 --> 02:05:36,958
At this late night?

2064
02:05:37,333 --> 02:05:38,750
You just do that what
I am saying.

2065
02:05:38,791 --> 02:05:41,041
What I was saying if
tomorrow morning…

2066
02:05:41,083 --> 02:05:41,915
No,

2067
02:05:41,958 --> 02:05:44,000
I need him right now…Go…

2068
02:05:50,375 --> 02:05:52,541
Raju…Raju.

2069
02:05:52,583 --> 02:05:53,875
Coming madam.

2070
02:05:55,541 --> 02:05:56,625
Yes Madam…

2071
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:02,916
Raju

2072
02:06:05,291 --> 02:06:07,666
you have to do one thing tonight.

2073
02:06:09,333 --> 02:06:10,500
Can you do it?

2074
02:06:41,583 --> 02:06:44,165
Shit, her mother is guarding.

2075
02:06:44,416 --> 02:06:45,208
Get up my son. Get up.

2076
02:06:45,250 --> 02:06:47,541
Tell me, how long you
will sit in this way?

2077
02:06:48,208 --> 02:06:50,540
Since yesterday, you have
not eaten anything.

2078
02:06:52,833 --> 02:06:55,415
Even your dad has also not
eaten anything.

2079
02:06:56,708 --> 02:06:58,708
He is getting old.

2080
02:07:02,250 --> 02:07:04,333
Let's go.
Get up my son, get up.

2081
02:07:04,375 --> 02:07:06,333
Let's take something to eat.

2082
02:07:07,333 --> 02:07:09,290
Hey, what are you doing?…

2083
02:07:09,333 --> 02:07:11,290
Hey, Leave me, leave…

2084
02:07:41,083 --> 02:07:44,665
Save me…Save me….

2085
02:08:06,708 --> 02:08:09,208
Hey, Who are you all?

2086
02:08:09,916 --> 02:08:12,166
Hey swine,
get out from here…

2087
02:08:12,791 --> 02:08:13,500
No…

2088
02:08:13,541 --> 02:09:08,583
Beat the scoundrel…

2089
02:09:08,625 --> 02:09:10,791
Bhumika, Bhumika…

2090
02:09:12,375 --> 02:09:14,333
Hey run away!

2091
02:09:41,500 --> 02:09:43,958
Alas! This was also in my fate!

2092
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,583
What an accident
happened to me!

2093
02:10:25,708 --> 02:10:28,375
Hello brother!
Does this money belongs to you?

2094
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:31,000
Shall we reach you to your place?

2095
02:10:32,958 --> 02:10:34,040
Are you listening?

2096
02:10:34,083 --> 02:10:36,290
Does this money belongs to you?

2097
02:10:37,875 --> 02:10:38,583
Yes

2098
02:10:39,916 --> 02:10:40,625
No

2099
02:10:48,916 --> 02:10:52,500
Listen, better you leave now.

2100
02:10:55,083 --> 02:10:59,915
You go to your home,
let me know your decision tomorrow.

2101
02:11:01,083 --> 02:11:02,625
Please leave now.

2102
02:11:07,500 --> 02:11:08,166
Uff!

2103
02:11:10,416 --> 02:11:11,708
It's fine.

2104
02:11:23,416 --> 02:11:27,083
Still Raju has not informed
any news, rascal!

2105
02:11:33,041 --> 02:11:33,791
What?

2106
02:11:37,166 --> 02:11:39,000
What? Not reachable.

2107
02:12:17,708 --> 02:12:20,625
How are you feeling my son?

2108
02:12:23,125 --> 02:12:30,708
It is still paining at left hand,
leg and whole body.

2109
02:12:31,958 --> 02:12:33,915
Where is dad?

2110
02:12:37,333 --> 02:12:39,375
Your Dad is cooking.

2111
02:12:39,416 --> 02:12:44,208
I got stitch at my hand so he
did not permit me to cook.

2112
02:12:50,416 --> 02:12:52,791
Yesterday, if that
person was not there.

2113
02:12:53,708 --> 02:12:55,958
Then what might have happened?

2114
02:12:57,250 --> 02:13:01,250
Whenever I am thinking of it,
I am feeling scared.

2115
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:11,333
Mom, that man came
like a divine messenger.

2116
02:13:12,708 --> 02:13:17,500
He fought with everyone
with that weak health.

2117
02:13:18,916 --> 02:13:21,000
Everyone ran away.

2118
02:13:23,083 --> 02:13:28,415
It remembered me of my grandfather.

2119
02:13:34,166 --> 02:13:38,166
Who is that person?
Do you know him?

2120
02:13:47,416 --> 02:13:48,333
No

2121
02:14:22,083 --> 02:14:24,000
No, it's ok.

2122
02:14:25,291 --> 02:14:27,000
Just lay down.

2123
02:14:31,250 --> 02:14:33,625
Feeling a lot of pain, right?

2124
02:14:34,166 --> 02:14:35,416
No, no.

2125
02:14:36,708 --> 02:14:38,708
Nothing like that.

2126
02:14:43,291 --> 02:14:45,000
Are you feeling weak?

2127
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:48,083
No

2128
02:14:48,791 --> 02:14:50,208
Don't talk rubbish.

2129
02:14:53,625 --> 02:14:56,000
Do you know how
much blood has been exhausted?

2130
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:04,541
I called the doctor.

2131
02:15:07,375 --> 02:15:09,125
He will come shortly.

2132
02:15:20,541 --> 02:15:22,208
With what did they hit you?

2133
02:15:27,541 --> 02:15:28,708
Don't know.

2134
02:15:30,291 --> 02:15:32,083
They might have killed you.

2135
02:15:33,708 --> 02:15:34,415
No

2136
02:15:36,291 --> 02:15:37,250
Yes

2137
02:15:37,916 --> 02:15:39,791
you know everything!

2138
02:15:40,916 --> 02:15:42,250
Brave Hero!

2139
02:15:45,916 --> 02:15:48,666
What were you doing
there at late night?

2140
02:15:51,083 --> 02:15:52,833
I was returning home.

2141
02:15:54,291 --> 02:15:55,541
Where did you went?

2142
02:15:58,208 --> 02:15:59,875
Montu's house.

2143
02:16:00,625 --> 02:16:03,416
I got late in chatting with him.

2144
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:08,000
Have you identified any of them?

2145
02:16:12,833 --> 02:16:13,415
No

2146
02:16:18,958 --> 02:16:21,833
What was the need to
plunge into that danger?

2147
02:16:25,083 --> 02:16:27,500
The girl was crying a lot.

2148
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:32,415
Do you know that girl?

2149
02:16:34,499 --> 02:16:35,958
Don't know.

2150
02:16:37,124 --> 02:16:40,249
Could have identified her
if I had noticed properly.

2151
02:16:42,415 --> 02:16:45,290
How could you rush on to
them in this health...

2152
02:16:45,708 --> 02:16:48,708
...just for an unknown girl?

2153
02:16:49,415 --> 02:16:50,915
What can I do?

2154
02:16:52,499 --> 02:16:54,708
The girl was crying tremendously.

2155
02:16:55,583 --> 02:16:58,708
After watching it,
how can I just leave that place?

2156
02:16:58,999 --> 02:17:02,415
You rushed to her just because
of she was crying?

2157
02:17:03,624 --> 02:17:05,249
Believe me

2158
02:17:05,833 --> 02:17:07,791
I had no attention to anything.

2159
02:17:09,124 --> 02:17:11,333
The girl was groaning heavily.

2160
02:17:12,333 --> 02:17:13,958
She was throwing her
hand and leg.

2161
02:17:13,999 --> 02:17:17,165
Everybody was holding her tightly.

2162
02:17:17,208 --> 02:17:19,791
She was deadly trying to escape.

2163
02:17:20,124 --> 02:17:22,665
The girl was screaming like anything.

2164
02:17:23,708 --> 02:17:25,833
I had no sense.

2165
02:17:25,874 --> 02:17:27,958
Just rushed to save her.

2166
02:17:27,999 --> 02:17:31,415
Save me…Save me…

2167
02:17:46,915 --> 02:17:48,874
I also screamed.

2168
02:17:50,249 --> 02:17:52,083
Threw my hands and legs...

2169
02:17:53,333 --> 02:17:54,291
had cried...

2170
02:17:57,208 --> 02:17:57,958
When?

2171
02:17:58,624 --> 02:17:59,708
That day.

2172
02:18:00,958 --> 02:18:04,999
When they took me inside the dark...

2173
02:18:07,208 --> 02:18:10,791
...and afterwards I never been able to
come back into the light.

2174
02:18:11,874 --> 02:18:14,415
My voice was chocked by screaming.

2175
02:18:16,165 --> 02:18:18,124
Where was you at that time?

2176
02:18:19,708 --> 02:18:21,208
Didn't you hear it?

2177
02:18:21,999 --> 02:18:23,833
Why didn't you hear?

2178
02:18:24,790 --> 02:18:26,374
I called so many times.

2179
02:18:26,415 --> 02:18:29,207
I called you so many times.

2180
02:18:29,249 --> 02:18:31,208
Why didn't you rush to me?

2181
02:18:31,708 --> 02:18:33,999
Why didn't you hear my scream?

2182
02:18:34,290 --> 02:18:36,249
Why? Why?...

2183
02:18:37,124 --> 02:18:38,624
Tell me why?

2184
02:18:44,208 --> 02:18:46,166
I called you a lot.

2185
02:18:47,790 --> 02:18:49,707
I called you.

2186
02:18:52,083 --> 02:18:53,624
Believe me...

2187
02:18:54,290 --> 02:18:55,832
Believe me...

2188
02:18:56,415 --> 02:18:59,915
I had called you
only from my mind and soul.

2189
02:19:00,790 --> 02:19:02,374
Called you only.

2190
02:19:04,165 --> 02:19:06,832
Why didn't you hear it?

2191
02:19:06,874 --> 02:19:07,874
Why?

2192
02:19:08,290 --> 02:19:09,165
Why?...

2193
02:19:09,208 --> 02:19:11,208
Why didn't you come to save me?

2194
02:19:11,249 --> 02:19:12,415
Why?...

2195
02:19:16,540 --> 02:19:18,790
Why didn't you come to save me?

2196
02:19:19,833 --> 02:19:20,999
Why?...

2197
02:19:31,915 --> 02:19:34,415
Why didn't you come to save me?

2198
02:19:54,208 --> 02:19:58,166
A Love tryst of colorless rain…

2199
02:20:01,791 --> 02:20:05,707
A Love tryst of colorless rain…

2200
02:20:06,583 --> 02:20:11,750
Crossing the sea overnight
in un-consoled heart

2201
02:20:11,791 --> 02:20:16,416
Light-Shade and cloud
in a tired bloomy day

2202
02:20:16,916 --> 02:20:21,582
Light-Shade and cloud
in a tired bloomy day

2203
02:20:22,083 --> 02:20:29,375
You are burning,
I also burn every day.

2204
02:20:32,541 --> 02:20:38,250
A Love tryst of colorless rain…
