Maffi Dona

12
00:07:57,786 --> 00:08:00,670
Sir , A family has to see you

13
00:08:08,694 --> 00:08:11,664
Sir, our son has gone
missing since yesterday

14
00:08:11,899 --> 00:08:13,242
Please look for him Sir

15
00:08:13,961 --> 00:08:17,289
He went to recharge his mobile after he came back from his classes

16
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:18,961
since then he hasn’t come back sir

17
00:08:19,774 --> 00:08:20,508
Hey, come here

18
00:08:21,555 --> 00:08:23,179
He never goes anywhere without telling

19
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,942
I am sure that something has
happened to our baby, Sir

20
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,707
Does your son have friendship
with guys like this?

21
00:08:29,817 --> 00:08:31,598
No sir, my son won’t
have anything like that

22
00:08:31,623 --> 00:08:34,363
Yeh, all parents say the
same thing about their kids

23
00:08:34,747 --> 00:08:36,098
There are many guys of this age..

24
00:08:37,114 --> 00:08:38,426
They go on a bike and
do chain snatching.

25
00:08:39,469 --> 00:08:41,051
They will stoop to
any level to for money

26
00:08:41,176 --> 00:08:43,082
No Sir,
My son won’t do such things

27
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:45,718
That’s not the way
we brought him up Sir

28
00:08:46,828 --> 00:08:47,296
Don’t cry

29
00:08:47,749 --> 00:08:48,218
I will enquire

30
00:08:48,968 --> 00:08:52,031

keep two available phone numbers

31
00:08:52,422 --> 00:08:52,796
Kurian..

32
00:08:54,156 --> 00:08:56,359

your kid through some other source

33
00:08:56,515 --> 00:08:57,171

34
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,179

36
00:09:00,892 --> 00:09:01,226
Okay sir

00:09:01,539 --> 00:09:01,961
Okay sir

38
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:02,804
Okay sir

39
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,492
Please do enquire sir

40
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:05,961
Yes

41
00:09:47,033 --> 00:09:49,017
Hey Anu, if you are
going to play like this,

42
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,413
Our school is going to win the cup

43
00:09:50,867 --> 00:09:53,320
That i will see when wee loose,
right now you guys bugger off

44
00:09:53,633 --> 00:09:55,976
We will leave, we are not going to
get anything by watching you guys play

45
00:10:12,234 --> 00:10:12,831
we are in a mess

46
00:10:18,378 --> 00:10:18,768
come here

47
00:10:19,144 --> 00:10:20,502
Dude, she is calling you

48
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:21,471
Go, go

49
00:10:24,567 --> 00:10:26,833
It just happened,
please don’t blast me

50
00:10:27,005 --> 00:10:27,786
please don’t tell mom

51
00:10:28,004 --> 00:10:29,973
The only activity I have is this
game, even that will stop

52
00:10:30,646 --> 00:10:32,739
Your mom says that you lack aim in
life

53
00:10:34,005 --> 00:10:35,473
but I don’t think so

54
00:10:36,411 --> 00:10:36,817
Hmm...Go

55
00:10:46,535 --> 00:10:47,535
Oh you came?

56
00:10:47,692 --> 00:10:48,144
Yes

57
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,191
How come so early?

58
00:10:51,004 --> 00:10:53,081
Mom, what’s your problem?

59
00:10:53,447 --> 00:10:54,911
If I come late ,
then you say that I am late

60
00:10:55,161 --> 00:10:56,473
if I come early, then you are like this

61
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:58,708
Do you love me at all, mom?

62
00:10:59,044 --> 00:11:02,817
I lose all my peace when I hear about
the kind of things happening around

63
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:04,395
Can you please shut up, Geetha?

64
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:06,358
Okay, I will shut up

65
00:11:06,896 --> 00:11:09,000
Mom, now what?

66
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:10,407
What’s your problem, mom?

67
00:11:10,766 --> 00:11:11,266
Say

68
00:11:12,313 --> 00:11:14,407
if me going for work
is a problem for you

69
00:11:14,813 --> 00:11:16,297
I won’t go from tomorrow

70
00:11:16,781 --> 00:11:18,703
if me not getting married is your problem

71
00:11:19,048 --> 00:11:21,219
then you find a
nice groom for me

72
00:11:21,407 --> 00:11:22,203
I will get married

73
00:11:23,235 --> 00:11:24,692
Yes, true? Enough

74
00:11:24,989 --> 00:11:26,067
All i wanted to hear was this

75
00:11:26,411 --> 00:11:28,567
Today itself mom will call
that broker and inform

76
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:29,598
Okay

77
00:11:31,145 --> 00:11:33,004
Why are you lying
to that poor soul?

78
00:11:33,552 --> 00:11:34,317
She is my mom know?

79
00:11:34,552 --> 00:11:35,161
I can live with that

80
00:11:36,161 --> 00:11:36,629
So what’s happening?

81
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:38,270
Did your Vivek come?

82
00:11:38,692 --> 00:11:40,643
He has left from there,
should be here by night

83
00:11:43,861 --> 00:11:44,862
Sir, Greetings

84
00:11:44,887 --> 00:11:45,127
what?

85
00:11:45,581 --> 00:11:47,206
My dear sir,
please make a decision

86
00:11:47,253 --> 00:11:48,581
it’s been two days since I have slept

87
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:51,752
If I stay awake for long, one of
my eyes gets closed like this, see

88
00:11:52,394 --> 00:11:54,286
While I was going I saw u sleeping
with both your eyes closed

89
00:11:54,349 --> 00:11:55,114
I was not sleeping sir

90
00:11:55,255 --> 00:11:57,567
I was thinking of how to park
the vehicles coming from outside

91
00:11:57,724 --> 00:11:59,676
My dear sir,
that Jackson and group has gone out

92
00:11:59,786 --> 00:12:03,223
only the Almighty knows, when and in
what shape they are going to return

93
00:12:03,271 --> 00:12:04,973
I am really scared sir

94
00:12:05,052 --> 00:12:05,833
You don’t have to be scared

95
00:12:06,005 --> 00:12:06,848
It’s his own flat

96
00:12:07,348 --> 00:12:09,881
otherwise i would hit him with my knee

97
00:12:10,582 --> 00:12:11,598
I would suggest that you be a bit careful

98
00:12:11,723 --> 00:12:12,051
What?

99
00:12:12,146 --> 00:12:14,083
Do you remember a guy ramming his car in to
a security chap in kannur and killing him?

100
00:12:14,329 --> 00:12:14,583
Yes

101
00:12:14,661 --> 00:12:15,192
Yes

102
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:16,754
I am really scared sir

103
00:12:16,989 --> 00:12:17,926
Don’t worry

104
00:12:18,302 --> 00:12:19,864
I am there, I will handle him.

105
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,458
When I was in ladakh

106
00:12:21,489 --> 00:12:23,926
It’s better to get run over by Jackson’s vehicle and get killed

107
00:12:23,973 --> 00:12:24,238
Hello

108
00:12:25,692 --> 00:12:26,676
Are you getting what I
have been telling you?

109
00:12:26,701 --> 00:12:27,551
How many times will
you tell all this?

110
00:12:27,661 --> 00:12:29,083
Hi colonel, what about the stage?

111
00:12:29,185 --> 00:12:30,879
That I have told Mathai,
he and his people will come and do it

112
00:12:31,005 --> 00:12:33,036
Colonel, only three
tankers of water has come

113
00:12:33,224 --> 00:12:34,411
I have already
called for the tanker

114
00:12:34,505 --> 00:12:35,708
Just sit here without
doing anything

115
00:12:35,787 --> 00:12:37,270
and be there to
pose for pictures

116
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:38,817
You please check everything

117
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:50,176
Hey Security, Open

118
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,067
What?

119
00:12:53,255 --> 00:12:54,020
Open quickly

120
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:01,110
Hey man

121
00:13:04,955 --> 00:13:05,548
I will show you

122
00:13:10,704 --> 00:13:13,501
Hello sir, that Jackson
and gang has come, yeh

123
00:13:19,469 --> 00:13:20,890
My dear Ramana,
Please walk faster

124
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,484
It’s to talk about
something, not to wrestle

125
00:13:22,516 --> 00:13:24,968
My dear colonel sir, cant we do
the talking tomorrow morning

126
00:13:25,094 --> 00:13:26,515
What has to be said tomorrow
should be said tomorrow

127
00:13:26,578 --> 00:13:27,504
what has to be said today
has to be said today

128
00:13:27,551 --> 00:13:29,192
That’s what we army guys had
learned, Come on

129
00:13:29,286 --> 00:13:30,708
None of them will be in
their senses at this hour

130
00:13:30,802 --> 00:13:32,723
So what? I will lose my
senses if I get angry

131
00:13:33,349 --> 00:13:34,786
Then why is colonel
not going there alone?

132
00:13:35,067 --> 00:13:35,770
That was enough

133
00:13:35,927 --> 00:13:38,473
but it will be good for you
to see how I handle them

134
00:13:38,504 --> 00:13:39,270
It will hold you in good stead

135
00:13:43,964 --> 00:13:44,808
Isn’t this their flat

136
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:45,776
I will okay it right away

137
00:13:47,511 --> 00:13:48,870
They won’t open,
they are scared

138
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,245
Oh god, I hope they
don’t open the door

139
00:13:56,574 --> 00:13:57,840
Oh no, Greetings.

140
00:13:58,152 --> 00:13:58,573
What?

141
00:13:58,730 --> 00:13:59,817
Oh Jackson, were you here

142
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,879
I thought you won’t be
here but you were here

143
00:14:02,255 --> 00:14:02,629
right?

144
00:14:02,739 --> 00:14:03,395
Tell me colonel

145
00:14:03,489 --> 00:14:05,801
This Sunday is our
association’s anniversary day

146
00:14:06,005 --> 00:14:08,239
we have come to invite
Jackson and friends

147
00:14:08,349 --> 00:14:09,004
Sure, we will be there

148
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:13,787
The next door neighbours have complained
about a little noise coming from here

149
00:14:13,897 --> 00:14:14,694
please take care of that

150
00:14:15,616 --> 00:14:17,490
Okay, tell the complainants
to go and kill themselves

151
00:14:17,788 --> 00:14:18,006
What? okay

152
00:14:18,491 --> 00:14:20,725
I decide the things here, got it?

153
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:21,662
Got it

154
00:14:22,569 --> 00:14:23,819
what Jackson said is correct

155
00:14:24,678 --> 00:14:25,225
go take rest

156
00:14:25,396 --> 00:14:25,630
Go

157
00:14:25,788 --> 00:14:26,381
Please go take rest

158
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:31,176
Unnecessarily I brought you with me

159
00:14:31,348 --> 00:14:32,379
now don’t go and tell
anyone about all this

160
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:32,879
No no no

161
00:14:32,974 --> 00:14:33,520
Move move move

162
00:14:35,974 --> 00:14:37,426
Come quickly , come
quickly, its already time

163
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:41,317
It’s not time yet,
he is going to see Anu

164
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,223
I didnt do anything

165
00:14:42,427 --> 00:14:43,676
Look, the bus has
come, Come come

166
00:14:47,863 --> 00:14:48,269
Bye Bro

167
00:14:49,598 --> 00:14:50,003
Anu

168
00:14:52,004 --> 00:14:52,785
Bye

169
00:14:56,035 --> 00:14:58,285
It’s shameful, we need to
take the colonel to task

170
00:14:58,315 --> 00:15:00,457
What that colonel said
made us feel weaker

171
00:15:03,816 --> 00:15:05,750
Then let’s change it, okay?

172
00:15:17,021 --> 00:15:17,489
Jackson

173
00:15:23,315 --> 00:15:23,799
Leave

174
00:15:24,487 --> 00:15:24,909
Leave

175
00:15:26,362 --> 00:15:26,706
Go

176
00:16:35,565 --> 00:16:37,906
If you ever dare to touch any
woman’s body without her permission

177
00:17:09,685 --> 00:17:10,372
Hi Vivek

178
00:17:10,388 --> 00:17:10,575
hey

179
00:17:10,998 --> 00:17:12,763
You remember about the
Sunday’s programme, right?

180
00:17:13,263 --> 00:17:14,138
Your should song should rock

181
00:17:14,513 --> 00:17:17,200
Dear Ancy, I had begged that colonel
sir, to keep me out of it

182
00:17:17,388 --> 00:17:18,028
but he wouldn’t listen

183
00:17:18,169 --> 00:17:19,325
I haven’t done any preparations

184
00:17:19,529 --> 00:17:21,794
We all have high expectations,
don’t abscond

185
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:22,513
Will see

186
00:17:23,076 --> 00:17:24,129
What? To abscond?

187
00:17:24,161 --> 00:17:24,364
No

188
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:25,145
Where is Ancy off to?

189
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:26,583
To see colonel sir

190
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:29,020
What’s this? Why I am not
able to write like earlier?

191
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:31,754
Why is my hand shaking?
Is it because I haven’t taken any alcohol?

192
00:17:31,908 --> 00:17:32,301
Colonel

193
00:17:32,755 --> 00:17:35,489
Hi, Ancy. Sit down Ancy

194
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:38,864
See Ancy, the Anniversary is just around the corner

195
00:17:39,146 --> 00:17:40,567
Your support gives me courage

196
00:17:40,661 --> 00:17:40,895
ok

197
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,161
There are many idiots roaming
around here just to find flaws

198
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:44,348
we need to shock them

199
00:17:44,505 --> 00:17:45,286
We will shock them sir

200
00:17:51,423 --> 00:17:53,250
The dish is ready, you quickly
take a bath and come

201
00:17:53,876 --> 00:17:54,782
I will bath later,

202
00:17:54,923 --> 00:17:55,688
first let me have a peg

203
00:17:58,657 --> 00:17:58,985
Hello,

204
00:18:01,595 --> 00:18:01,907
maalu

205
00:18:02,204 --> 00:18:02,547
Maalu

206
00:18:03,204 --> 00:18:03,704
Not like that

207
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:04,442
Not like that , not like that

208
00:18:04,474 --> 00:18:05,942
I had an urgent work

209
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:09,020
I delivered it and just
came stepped in to the flat

210
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:11,661
Okay, I stepped out of office

211
00:18:12,239 --> 00:18:13,239
will see you in the evening

212
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:28,918
I have told you so many times to quit
smoking, but you just won’t listen, right?

213
00:18:28,943 --> 00:18:30,840
I was enjoying the smoke,
you just spoiled it

214
00:18:31,262 --> 00:18:31,840
Do one thing

215
00:18:31,965 --> 00:18:33,340
sit here and continue
smoking, I am leaving

216
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:33,739
Hey,

217
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,254
don’t go

218
00:18:35,911 --> 00:18:37,864
Next week a few of my
family members are coming

219
00:18:38,567 --> 00:18:39,911
just tell me what to
tell them and then go

220
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:41,270
Did they agree

221
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:43,473
It would be me more right to
say that I made them agree

222
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:47,801
Hello

223
00:18:49,087 --> 00:18:49,477
Who is it?

224
00:18:51,118 --> 00:18:52,102
Why are you being
unfair towards me?

225
00:18:52,634 --> 00:18:53,039
Cut it

226
00:18:55,727 --> 00:18:56,071
Okay

227
00:18:58,493 --> 00:18:58,821
Who is it?

228
00:18:59,306 --> 00:19:00,149
Did you beat up those guys?

229
00:19:00,493 --> 00:19:00,805
Which guys?

230
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:02,211
Jackson and team

231
00:19:02,587 --> 00:19:02,836
Then?

232
00:19:03,556 --> 00:19:04,149
Shouldn’t i?

233
00:19:04,821 --> 00:19:06,395
getting beating is not enough for
them, they should be killed

234
00:19:06,739 --> 00:19:07,239
low- lifes

235
00:19:07,927 --> 00:19:09,192
Then shall I go and kill them?

236
00:19:11,598 --> 00:19:12,333
Should I kill them?

237
00:19:14,177 --> 00:19:14,833
Should I kill them?

238
00:19:18,161 --> 00:19:18,864
Don’t bite, Dog

239
00:19:28,427 --> 00:19:29,083
Greetings

240
00:19:29,114 --> 00:19:33,489
Our today’s guest on “Day with
star” has many peculiarities,

241
00:19:33,552 --> 00:19:35,379
The one and only Saji Chengannoor

242
00:19:47,771 --> 00:19:48,614
Greetings Sir

243
00:19:48,661 --> 00:19:50,583
Greetings, one minute

244
00:19:52,161 --> 00:19:53,628
Son please bring that

245
00:19:56,255 --> 00:19:56,848
Here, here

246
00:20:00,802 --> 00:20:01,567
Shall we take once more

247
00:20:14,905 --> 00:20:15,905
Greetings sir

248
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:16,638
Greetings

249
00:20:17,045 --> 00:20:22,286
In this busy life of yours,how
much time do u spare for work outs?

250
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:25,223
Usually Malayali’s
are chasing money

251
00:20:25,661 --> 00:20:27,208
but I prefer to chase health

252
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:31,321
Our Mahatmaji had said
“health is wealth”

253
00:20:31,947 --> 00:20:33,446
and I am a follower of him

254
00:20:33,837 --> 00:20:37,415
How much jogging do
you do every day?

255
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:40,806
Around 10-15
kilometers every day

256
00:20:40,978 --> 00:20:45,111
if I am in a good mood,
it goes to 20-25

257
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:45,743
Are you coming?

258
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:50,780
It seems like he is in a good
mood, he is off like a bullet

259
00:20:51,484 --> 00:20:52,823
Cut it man, won’t be
able to get up tomorrow

260
00:20:55,812 --> 00:20:56,655
Show me that visual

261
00:20:58,718 --> 00:20:59,249
give me water

262
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,538
zoom that portion

263
00:21:07,495 --> 00:21:08,447
one minute

264
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:11,611
Hey, take this also

265
00:21:16,877 --> 00:21:18,596
Take a close shot or else
the chair will be in frame

266
00:21:18,674 --> 00:21:19,814
Please avoid that chair

267
00:21:19,893 --> 00:21:20,111
Okay

268
00:21:29,771 --> 00:21:30,193
Give me the phone

269
00:21:31,662 --> 00:21:32,958
Everything is okay, right?

270
00:21:34,193 --> 00:21:36,771
Enough for today, rest tomorrow

271
00:21:39,021 --> 00:21:39,583
Hello,

272
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:42,385
some one is after us,

273
00:21:43,072 --> 00:21:44,010
please keep an eye

274
00:21:47,932 --> 00:21:48,869
Tomorrow tomorrow,

275
00:21:49,214 --> 00:21:49,823
give me water

276
00:22:26,532 --> 00:22:28,264
The world is a nest

277
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:33,045
sing along with me dove from this nest

278
00:22:33,218 --> 00:22:35,123
oh dove

279
00:22:35,311 --> 00:22:36,954
The world is a nest

280
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:41,704
sing along with me dove from this nest

281
00:22:41,954 --> 00:22:43,595
oh dove

282
00:22:44,048 --> 00:22:49,345
we can run waving the feathers of our small
dreams in this flowery breeze as much as we can

283
00:22:50,002 --> 00:22:52,782
to ride on the rainbow

284
00:22:52,814 --> 00:22:55,036
What do the memories say?

285
00:22:57,365 --> 00:22:59,615
What if we flock togeather?

286
00:23:01,553 --> 00:23:05,583
This is the awaited day

287
00:23:05,928 --> 00:23:10,068
If we demarcate, we would be
unable to see any spindle

288
00:23:10,334 --> 00:23:14,368
If we stay on opposite banks,
we won’t be able to fly together

289
00:23:14,634 --> 00:23:18,211
If every day becomes like Onam,

290
00:23:19,017 --> 00:23:22,284
beautiful memories will
swing the swing and come

291
00:23:23,399 --> 00:23:27,055
Like Rufous tree pie’s

292
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:31,835
every minute we need
honey pipes to swim

293
00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:48,815
Have a hill of banter together

294
00:23:49,518 --> 00:23:53,643
whenever I don’t see
you, I feel the pain

295
00:23:53,905 --> 00:23:57,494
Will wait to match
the pitch with you

296
00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:01,885
to playfully dance with the wind

297
00:24:02,604 --> 00:24:06,463
Without letting anyone know,
Can you come today, my dream bird?

298
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:10,806
Every word should
shine like the stars

299
00:24:11,354 --> 00:24:15,112
The never ending downpour of love
should hug each other at the shore

300
00:24:15,753 --> 00:24:18,205
What do the memories say?

301
00:24:20,284 --> 00:24:22,580
What if we flock togeather?

302
00:24:24,409 --> 00:24:28,159
This is the day we waited for

303
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:32,857
If we demarcate, we would be
unable to see any spindle

304
00:24:33,092 --> 00:24:37,123
If we stay on opposite banks,
we won’t be able to fly together

305
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:41,569
If we demarcate, we would be
unable to see any spindle

306
00:24:41,882 --> 00:24:46,149
If we stay on opposite banks,
we won’t be able to fly together

307
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:56,051
Hey babe, wanted to meet you
badly, that’s why I called

308
00:25:00,183 --> 00:25:01,206
Let me pay and come

309
00:25:02,808 --> 00:25:03,331
How much is it?

310
00:25:03,378 --> 00:25:03,635
Twenty rupees

311
00:25:04,097 --> 00:25:04,760
Okay, twenty rupees

312
00:25:06,316 --> 00:25:06,573
Let’s go

313
00:25:17,448 --> 00:25:17,978
Zaheer, no

314
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:35,969
Let me go

315
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,929
Master, the product is ready

316
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:13,697
Bloody Looser,
where the heck are you looking from?

317
00:26:13,932 --> 00:26:14,127
Sorry big brother

318
00:26:14,152 --> 00:26:14,308
Get lost

319
00:26:19,107 --> 00:26:19,880
First watch the video

320
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,106
it’s of a different level

321
00:26:28,509 --> 00:26:28,619
Okay

322
00:26:28,658 --> 00:26:29,525
All right, Will meet again

323
00:26:31,565 --> 00:26:31,916
Look he came

324
00:26:33,533 --> 00:26:34,502
What happened? Did u get the stuff?

325
00:26:34,565 --> 00:26:35,087
Yes, here

326
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,798
My tension is, how would we watch this?

327
00:26:42,869 --> 00:26:45,462
That’s not an issue,
we will use our usual formula

328
00:26:45,916 --> 00:26:47,494
If we had a phone ,it
wouldn’t have been a problem

329
00:26:48,236 --> 00:26:51,068
Mom has promised me an I phone,
if I score good marks in Plus 2

330
00:26:52,303 --> 00:26:54,233
Buddy, Study well

331
00:26:55,639 --> 00:26:59,592
If i promise, I will deliver

332
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:06,067
Any old paper, scraps for sale sir?

333
00:27:20,182 --> 00:27:21,955
What’s this? Nobody around?

334
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:25,544
Any old paper, plastic,
glass bottles, scraps for sale?

335
00:27:27,732 --> 00:27:28,028
What?

336
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:31,099
Big bro, any scarp for sale?

337
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:33,919

338
00:27:34,606 --> 00:27:36,713
Big bro, any old paper,
plastic, scraps for sale?

339
00:27:36,972 --> 00:27:39,276
This is a flat; here nobody sells
all these stuff, cant you understand?

340
00:27:39,409 --> 00:27:40,362
It’s for survival ,Big Bro

341
00:27:40,995 --> 00:27:43,370
Don’t finish off my survival, with this over
smartness off yours,

342
00:27:43,417 --> 00:27:44,448
Leave, Leave, go, leave

343
00:27:46,866 --> 00:27:47,236
go

344
00:28:00,371 --> 00:28:00,683
Yes

345
00:28:03,981 --> 00:28:05,027
Shall we go for a movie?

346
00:28:05,192 --> 00:28:05,738
I am not in a mood

347
00:28:08,059 --> 00:28:08,300
Hello

348
00:28:09,857 --> 00:28:10,879
What? Did they come?

349
00:28:11,888 --> 00:28:12,708
Please ask them to sit

350
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:14,395
I will come immediately, got it?

351
00:28:14,958 --> 00:28:15,434
Okay

352
00:28:16,864 --> 00:28:18,254
I need to leave immediately
it s a client

353
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:21,267
I took leave from office because you
told me that the whole day you are free

354
00:28:21,721 --> 00:28:22,791
Where did this client
come from, then?

355
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,087
Babe, I have a lot of hope
riding on this project

356
00:28:25,643 --> 00:28:26,650
It’s the final discussion
on it today

357
00:28:27,299 --> 00:28:28,595
if this gets okayed,
I will rock

358
00:28:29,322 --> 00:28:31,041
You are always busy with
your work and client

359
00:28:33,088 --> 00:28:33,259
Let’s go

360
00:28:34,533 --> 00:28:36,205
come on quick,
there is no time

361
00:28:52,218 --> 00:28:53,975
Feel like eating her up

362
00:28:54,226 --> 00:28:54,546
Hello?

363
00:28:55,476 --> 00:28:55,678
What?

364
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:56,514
What did you say?

365
00:28:58,437 --> 00:28:59,866
What? Say it again

366
00:29:00,991 --> 00:29:01,267
Say

367
00:29:02,424 --> 00:29:04,228
You dare not say it again

368
00:29:04,525 --> 00:29:05,783
What is the problem?

369
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:08,611
They were saying that I am a Dish

370
00:29:09,346 --> 00:29:10,759
No, I don’t think so,
they must have lied

371
00:29:11,025 --> 00:29:12,064
Bugger off

372
00:29:12,393 --> 00:29:12,572

373
00:29:17,947 --> 00:29:18,915

374
00:29:19,494 --> 00:29:21,087
Evening you meet that client only

375
00:29:27,488 --> 00:29:28,910
Mom, it’s been how long since

376
00:29:29,426 --> 00:29:29,824
Oh, was it you kid?

377
00:29:30,019 --> 00:29:30,503
Aunty

378
00:29:30,551 --> 00:29:30,925
come

379
00:29:31,762 --> 00:29:33,238
I thought it would be mom

380
00:29:33,566 --> 00:29:34,324
That’s okay

381
00:29:34,902 --> 00:29:37,800
we have been here for a while.
Was waiting for you to come

382
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:39,962
Come let’s sit there

383
00:29:41,627 --> 00:29:42,744
Yes, sit here

384
00:29:45,354 --> 00:29:46,502
This is his sister , Vidya

385
00:29:46,682 --> 00:29:47,845
I have seen Vidya in photographs

386
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:48,877
I have seen you too

387
00:29:49,158 --> 00:29:50,541
This is Vivek’s one and
only maternal uncle

388
00:29:51,315 --> 00:29:52,361
You want some water to drink?

389
00:29:53,674 --> 00:29:54,439
I wasn’t pulling your leg.

390
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,634
I was serious,
you must be tired.

391
00:29:56,721 --> 00:29:56,970
Drink

392
00:29:57,979 --> 00:30:00,775
I was the one who told Vivek,
not to inform her about your visit

393
00:30:02,408 --> 00:30:03,595
That’s why she looks embarrassed

394
00:30:03,822 --> 00:30:05,289
Where is Vivek, kid?

395
00:30:05,643 --> 00:30:06,181
I am here

396
00:30:11,682 --> 00:30:13,986
Maternal Uncle is suggesting a wedding
in the coming month of August

397
00:30:26,181 --> 00:30:33,821
Where you waiting to tell the fragrant
breeze about your marriage at its ear brim

398
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:37,016
In the brim of the eye,

399
00:30:37,611 --> 00:30:40,891
looking at this mirror and coquettishly talking,

400
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:42,837
will you act as a companion

401
00:30:43,127 --> 00:30:45,963
Tomorrow on this
beautiful golden body,

402
00:30:46,073 --> 00:30:49,369
you can gracefully wear
the lunar wedding string

403
00:30:49,839 --> 00:30:54,863
To live with me , to complete your half

404
00:30:55,051 --> 00:31:00,337
Oh my Eden dream, you came on your own

405
00:31:01,595 --> 00:31:06,329
You became the heaven on earth

406
00:31:08,176 --> 00:31:12,738
Inside the casket of a bright star in
the constellation boots golden dream

407
00:31:14,098 --> 00:31:18,308
Did we wake up together to
join the pearls together

408
00:31:20,027 --> 00:31:24,120
While we come togeather
in the small flower bud

409
00:31:25,973 --> 00:31:30,002
Did your sparkling eyes
have an increased shyness?

410
00:31:56,330 --> 00:32:01,931
Every day, with those soft
fragrant finger tips of yours

411
00:32:02,252 --> 00:32:07,212
you sang touching my life softly

412
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:12,402
The night that was
humming on its own

413
00:32:13,527 --> 00:32:19,447
Again, I am taking its
pouring silent music on my own

414
00:32:41,782 --> 00:32:43,462
Hi Ancy, good morning

415
00:32:44,009 --> 00:32:44,525
Good morning

416
00:32:45,017 --> 00:32:46,384
We don’t get to
see you now a days

417
00:32:46,775 --> 00:32:47,072
Sorry?

418
00:32:47,833 --> 00:32:49,540
I was just saying that,
you are not seen around

419
00:32:50,292 --> 00:32:50,642
oh

420
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:54,067
Ancy, if you are free,
can I take you out for a coffee?

421
00:32:54,575 --> 00:32:56,200
No need, I have
other things to do

422
00:32:56,646 --> 00:32:57,520
Then, shall I drop you?

423
00:32:58,387 --> 00:32:59,270
I have booked
an online taxi

424
00:32:59,645 --> 00:33:00,731
Oh useless

425
00:33:04,424 --> 00:33:05,189
Vehicle came

426
00:33:05,822 --> 00:33:06,142
Okay?

427
00:33:08,385 --> 00:33:09,009
Useless

428
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:12,541
Haven’t got any, since
these guys have come

429
00:33:14,904 --> 00:33:15,716
You come, step out quickly

430
00:33:16,029 --> 00:33:18,068
He is not well, he
has loose motions

431
00:33:18,334 --> 00:33:19,537
He is saying
that its paining

432
00:33:19,779 --> 00:33:20,912
Hey kid, should we go
to the hospital?

433
00:33:21,186 --> 00:33:21,685
No need daddy,

434
00:33:22,092 --> 00:33:22,912
it will be cured

435
00:33:23,193 --> 00:33:24,373
I think it’s because
of the breakfast

436
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,447
Okay, then we are leaving

437
00:33:26,916 --> 00:33:28,033
Don’t go to school today

438
00:33:28,471 --> 00:33:29,580
Son we are leaving

439
00:33:34,432 --> 00:33:35,017
Mummy,

440
00:33:35,971 --> 00:33:36,423
Daddy

441
00:33:39,385 --> 00:33:39,986
They left

442
00:33:40,611 --> 00:33:40,970
Come on in

443
00:33:50,017 --> 00:33:51,400

444
00:33:52,057 --> 00:33:53,087
I don’t know , let me check

445
00:33:54,885 --> 00:33:55,337
Who is it?

446
00:33:55,744 --> 00:33:56,697
I don’t know

447
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:58,955
Mummy and daddy is gone

448
00:33:59,783 --> 00:34:01,205
Is your stomach ache,
less now?

449
00:34:01,502 --> 00:34:02,439
Yes, it has decreased now,
I am feeling better

450
00:34:02,486 --> 00:34:04,033
I will make you a
hot rice gruel for you

00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:06,048
Your face looks look tired

452
00:34:06,275 --> 00:34:07,689
Your mummy has asked me
to make rice gruel for you

453
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:10,033
Nice, your friends have come

454
00:34:10,182 --> 00:34:12,806
Friends should be like this, they came
to see you when you are unwell

455
00:34:12,893 --> 00:34:13,798
Will bring you some water to drink

456
00:34:15,627 --> 00:34:16,962
Yes, Since she has come

457
00:34:17,549 --> 00:34:18,041
we are peaceful

458
00:34:18,361 --> 00:34:18,783
Shall we leave?

459
00:34:19,566 --> 00:34:20,518

460
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,346
You must be really tired,

461
00:34:57,395 --> 00:34:57,793
Yes Maalu

462
00:34:59,372 --> 00:35:00,043

00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,962
I will call you right away.
Just finishing a small job

466
00:35:13,025 --> 00:35:13,955
Go and open the door, dude

467
00:35:14,275 --> 00:35:15,056
For how long the door
bell has been ringing?

468
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:16,330
I am going

469
00:35:16,393 --> 00:35:17,189
Lethargically sitting there

470
00:35:19,315 --> 00:35:19,845
Is Vivek bro there

471
00:35:20,596 --> 00:35:21,158

472
00:35:21,885 --> 00:35:22,259
Who is it?

473
00:35:22,494 --> 00:35:23,291
The boys have come to meet you

474
00:35:26,815 --> 00:35:27,634
Oh you guys. What is it?

475
00:35:27,659 --> 00:35:28,767
Vivek bro, we want you
to tell you something

476
00:35:29,299 --> 00:35:29,877
Come, sit

477
00:35:29,994 --> 00:35:31,509
We want to talk
to you personally

478
00:35:31,775 --> 00:35:33,181
Oh, is it that serious?

479
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:36,887
It seems like boys want to
talk to someone intelligent,

480
00:35:36,903 --> 00:35:37,676
so you sit here and
keep typing in the phone

481
00:35:37,810 --> 00:35:38,340
Go , Go

482
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:40,622
Rahul, stop crying and tell me

483
00:35:40,647 --> 00:35:42,153
I want to know,
who gave this to you?

484
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:43,817
I have been asking you peacefully till now,

485
00:35:44,005 --> 00:35:45,403

486
00:35:46,013 --> 00:35:46,668

488
00:35:53,522 --> 00:35:54,287
Oh vivek

489
00:35:54,873 --> 00:35:55,849
Aunty, is Rahul there?

490
00:35:56,170 --> 00:35:57,236
Yes, whats it?

491
00:35:57,725 --> 00:35:58,326
Can i see him?

492
00:35:58,834 --> 00:35:59,263
Come in

493
00:36:00,815 --> 00:36:02,517
• Uncle you dint go for work today? Or you took an off?

494
00:36:02,799 --> 00:36:03,423
I went and came

495
00:36:06,049 --> 00:36:08,337
The boys were telling me that you
found a pen drive lying around. Did you?

496
00:36:08,783 --> 00:36:09,033
Yes

497
00:36:09,502 --> 00:36:10,353
Hope you did not use it

498
00:36:11,087 --> 00:36:11,330
No

499
00:36:11,775 --> 00:36:13,533
Don’t use it; it might
be full of virus.

500
00:36:13,807 --> 00:36:14,556
Your system will crash.

501
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:15,595
I had to face an issue like that once

502
00:36:15,775 --> 00:36:18,884
If you have found something
like that, give it to Vivek

503
00:36:19,354 --> 00:36:21,339
Vivek, please dump it

504
00:36:21,425 --> 00:36:21,714
Okay

505
00:36:22,705 --> 00:36:24,876
Aunty, if Rahul is free,
can I take him out?

506
00:36:25,058 --> 00:36:25,964
Okay, Go

507
00:36:27,956 --> 00:36:28,190
Come

508
00:36:30,238 --> 00:36:33,955
Old paper, plastic, iron scrap,
bottles for sale?

509
00:36:43,485 --> 00:36:45,151
Hello, Hello, Daughter?

510
00:36:59,753 --> 00:37:02,659
Okay, Okay, we can arrange
a video call tomorrow,

511
00:37:03,253 --> 00:37:03,987
okay sure

512
00:37:04,558 --> 00:37:06,221
Anu, come and have food

513
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,024
Get up and come here

514
00:37:11,736 --> 00:37:15,032
Tomorrow when people come for inspection
at 10, the entire floor should be ready.

515
00:37:15,626 --> 00:37:16,767
Don’t give me any excuse

516
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,196
Here is the plate

517
00:37:24,091 --> 00:37:26,153
Daddy, tomorrow is my final match

518
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:28,911
Yah, I know

519
00:37:29,224 --> 00:37:30,262
You are the team captain, right?

520
00:37:30,384 --> 00:37:30,950
Play well

521
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:34,239
Both of you should come to
watch the match tomorrow

522
00:37:35,739 --> 00:37:38,049
Tomorrow dad has auditing,
how can I come?

523
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,822
Tomorrow , I have a video conference
with a client based in the US

524
00:37:43,893 --> 00:37:45,369
It has come to a state where
there is no time for anything

525
00:37:52,679 --> 00:37:57,163
Hey, when you are free, cant you come
and spend some time with my folks?

526
00:37:57,835 --> 00:37:59,459
All that after marriage

527
00:37:59,749 --> 00:38:02,053
Then everything should be
done only after marriage

528
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:03,288
Don’t say like that

529
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:06,397
If you want I will come and stay
with you in your flat for a week

530
00:38:07,193 --> 00:38:07,865
No way

531
00:38:17,822 --> 00:38:18,165
Was it you?

532
00:38:20,619 --> 00:38:21,752
Am I bugging you?

533
00:38:22,174 --> 00:38:22,861
No way

534
00:38:25,236 --> 00:38:27,798
Why are looking a bit down?
Did your folks fight even today?

535
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,337
How did you understand?

536
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,837
If you have to come here at this
hour, that has to be the reason

537
00:38:33,158 --> 00:38:33,329
Right?

538
00:38:34,251 --> 00:38:34,704
Yes, true

539
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:37,181
Leave all that, what is
troubling you now?

540
00:38:37,822 --> 00:38:38,908
Tomorrow is my finals.

541
00:38:39,283 --> 00:38:43,087
I wanted Papa and Mummy to watch
my match at least this time around

542
00:38:43,423 --> 00:38:44,751
but they don’t have
time for all that

543
00:38:45,619 --> 00:38:48,064
My friends will have their families
coming down to watch the match.

544
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:50,150
I am the only one who has nobody

545
00:38:50,697 --> 00:38:52,102
Who told you that
you have no one?

546
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:57,496
Tomorrow, both of us will be in the
gallery to watch your match, right?

547
00:38:57,762 --> 00:38:58,378
Yes, of course

548
00:38:59,176 --> 00:38:59,972
But there is one condition,

549
00:39:01,902 --> 00:39:02,730
you have to win

550
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:04,699

Aunty

00:44:14,428 --> 00:44:17,334
Vivek, our daughter is not there for
you to take around as per your wish.

No Aunty, it’s not like that,
Anu is like my own

00:44:24,006 --> 00:44:25,818
See Vivek, we are not interested
in creating an issue unnecessarily

619
00:44:26,694 --> 00:44:29,162
We are dealing this issue
in a very peaceful manner

620
00:44:29,853 --> 00:44:32,138
Don’t get involve urself in
Anu’s issue unnecessarily

621
00:44:33,926 --> 00:44:35,770

other things to do

00:44:36,693 --> 00:44:37,349
Uncle , me

00:44:41,162 --> 00:44:42,645
If you repeat this

625
00:44:43,310 --> 00:44:44,583
No aunty, you don’t have
to fear about that

626
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,981
Oh my, we have no fear.

627
00:44:47,458 --> 00:44:49,638
We just need to do a phone
call to put you behind the bars

628
00:44:50,154 --> 00:44:52,888
I am holding myself Back only because
Emmanuel told me, otherwise I

629
00:44:53,326 --> 00:44:53,560

00:45:02,113 --> 00:45:03,557
Dude, you don’t worry,

632
00:45:03,636 --> 00:45:05,948
both of them are crazy.

633
00:45:06,644 --> 00:45:09,964
They won’t love their own daughter
nor allow others to love her

634
00:46:06,423 --> 00:46:06,813
Geethu

635
00:46:09,094 --> 00:46:09,750

00:46:12,298 --> 00:46:13,133

00:46:15,001 --> 00:46:15,492

640
00:46:17,469 --> 00:46:18,977

641
00:46:19,719 --> 00:46:20,469
Hello

642
00:46:23,423 --> 00:46:23,930

00:46:24,626 --> 00:46:25,985

00:46:26,165 --> 00:46:28,133
8b or c, sir?

645
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:28,961
What?

646
00:46:30,032 --> 00:46:30,688
C, c sir

647
00:46:31,368 --> 00:46:33,266
Were you on duty when
she went missing?

648
00:46:34,891 --> 00:46:36,383
Me, me, me was it me?

649
00:46:36,805 --> 00:46:37,102
What?

650
00:46:37,727 --> 00:46:39,493
No, it was me who was on duty

651
00:46:39,705 --> 00:46:40,259
What the heck?

652
00:46:40,345 --> 00:46:42,126
I am really scared of Cops, Sir

653
00:46:43,588 --> 00:46:44,071
Move the vehicle

654
00:47:08,135 --> 00:47:10,549
Sir, I am Colonel, Colonel Chacko

655
00:47:10,814 --> 00:47:11,072
Okay

656
00:47:11,322 --> 00:47:11,611
My bad

657
00:47:12,174 --> 00:47:12,400
Sir

658
00:47:14,135 --> 00:47:15,533
He seems to be a tough nut

659
00:47:16,299 --> 00:47:19,587
Hi I am Ancy, a social worker,
I was the one who informed you

660
00:47:20,126 --> 00:47:21,985
Okay, I want to know
a couple of things

661
00:47:35,256 --> 00:47:37,420
Bharatan, get all her call
details today itself

662
00:47:57,432 --> 00:47:59,299
We only have her

663
00:48:00,243 --> 00:48:02,900
We have lived only for her

664
00:48:04,932 --> 00:48:07,228
Somehow save her Sir

665
00:48:17,039 --> 00:48:17,419
Silence

666
00:48:21,029 --> 00:48:23,529
Look, i heard all of you

667
00:48:23,818 --> 00:48:25,974
The police will investigate
this case but before that,

668
00:48:26,576 --> 00:48:29,638
since you are the ones
who know more about Anu,

669
00:48:30,193 --> 00:48:30,911
so try to remember

670
00:48:31,513 --> 00:48:34,685
Like in the last few days,
seeing her with any strangers,

671
00:48:34,982 --> 00:48:36,801
anybody giving her any gifts or presents,

672
00:48:37,411 --> 00:48:41,309
anybody followed her on the way to
her classes or back, anything like that?

673
00:48:44,049 --> 00:48:45,533
My daughter is naive, Sir

674
00:48:48,939 --> 00:48:50,978
We don’t know what happened

675
00:48:51,775 --> 00:48:53,978
Might be. I am saying
this because of that.

676
00:48:54,369 --> 00:48:57,087
In most of the cases like these, the
villains are usually romance and friendship.

677
00:48:57,658 --> 00:48:59,689
So if you have any suspicion on
anyone or anything like that ,

678
00:48:59,931 --> 00:49:00,883
say it right here right now

679
00:49:18,788 --> 00:49:19,218
Sir

680
00:49:34,825 --> 00:49:35,551
There is an exclusive

681
00:49:51,851 --> 00:49:52,273
Get up

682
00:49:59,213 --> 00:49:59,564
Move

683
00:50:09,092 --> 00:50:09,693
Oh god

684
00:50:15,202 --> 00:50:15,529
Move, move

685
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:21,232
Where is my daughter?

686
00:50:24,046 --> 00:50:25,713
What did you do to her?

687
00:50:40,717 --> 00:50:41,389
Why did you?

688
00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:42,960
Sir, I haven’t done anything

689
00:50:55,381 --> 00:50:55,802
It’s not me

690
00:50:56,873 --> 00:50:57,185
Say

691
00:50:58,201 --> 00:50:58,560
Where is she?

692
00:50:58,623 --> 00:50:59,388
I don’t know Sir

693
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:02,505
You won’t say, right? Say

694
00:51:03,193 --> 00:51:03,528
Say it

695
00:51:03,959 --> 00:51:04,380
Say it

696
00:51:16,592 --> 00:51:16,872
Sir

697
00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:17,473
What’s it?

698
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:18,591
Dysp ‘s call for you sir

699
00:51:20,881 --> 00:51:21,739
You don’t know anything, right?

700
00:51:24,670 --> 00:51:24,919

He is not saying sir

704
00:51:33,201 --> 00:51:34,802
It is that girl’s mom who
expressed a suspicion

705
00:51:36,818 --> 00:51:38,263
No, hasn’t left the town limit sir

706
00:51:39,373 --> 00:51:40,669
We are not leaving any
vehicles without checking Sir

707
00:51:41,373 --> 00:51:41,841
Okay Sir

708
00:52:24,075 --> 00:52:24,442
Hey Man

709
00:52:27,248 --> 00:52:28,302
Old Paper sir

710
00:52:28,935 --> 00:52:29,294
Come here man

711
00:52:40,669 --> 00:52:41,856
Sir, old paper sir

712
00:52:43,505 --> 00:52:44,645

718
00:52:54,096 --> 00:52:54,322
Okay

00:52:55,493 --> 00:52:55,924
Go, go

00:52:56,995 --> 00:52:57,424
Okay Sir

721
00:53:15,676 --> 00:53:16,410
Greetings Sir

722
00:55:43,683 --> 00:55:44,355
She is alright

723
00:55:45,872 --> 00:55:46,012
Okay

724
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:52,625
Hey Doctor

725
00:55:54,812 --> 00:55:56,023
No, there is nothing to worry

726
00:55:56,157 --> 00:55:56,758
she is alright

727
00:55:57,336 --> 00:55:58,664
I have given a sedative

728
00:55:58,891 --> 00:55:59,578
Left her sleep

729
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:02,141
If there are any problems,
let me know

730
00:56:03,053 --> 00:56:03,818
Let me just see my daughter

731
00:56:04,249 --> 00:56:04,913
Okay, come

732
00:56:05,827 --> 00:56:08,413
That kid is extremely scared,

733
00:56:09,624 --> 00:56:11,225
I didn’t tell your
wife about that.

734
00:56:12,257 --> 00:56:14,710
Ask your wife to take
care of her really well

735
00:56:15,764 --> 00:56:18,725
Then don’t let anyone
know about this

736
00:56:19,687 --> 00:56:21,342
Let her be a bit okay,
after that we will see.

737
00:56:21,890 --> 00:56:22,053
Okay?

738
00:56:22,384 --> 00:56:22,548
Yes

739
00:56:33,623 --> 00:56:33,966
Anu,

740
00:56:35,318 --> 00:56:37,607
it’s been an hour since we have
been sitting here like this

741
00:56:38,147 --> 00:56:39,959
We are ready to sit
for any length of time

742
00:56:40,631 --> 00:56:41,412
but I want to know

743
00:56:41,967 --> 00:56:43,123
what happened to you Anu.

744
00:56:43,889 --> 00:56:45,037
Anu must be thinking

745
00:56:45,397 --> 00:56:46,834
that it has only happened to you

746
00:56:47,350 --> 00:56:47,560
No,

747
00:56:48,167 --> 00:56:49,162
it has happened to
many other people

748
00:56:51,330 --> 00:56:54,084
The parents of those are still unable
to know what happened to their kids

749
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:55,365
Those parents are living
like the living dead

750
00:56:56,045 --> 00:56:57,466
Tell us kid, what happened?

751
00:57:59,487 --> 00:58:03,072
What darling? Scared? okay

752
00:58:06,791 --> 00:58:08,088
Pure gold

753
00:58:08,877 --> 00:58:10,931
Lets go to my palace,
lets go to my palace

754
00:58:11,179 --> 00:58:12,322
Come ,get up

755
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:15,236
Oh no, no,
you have been tied down

756
00:58:17,307 --> 00:58:18,009
This is my style

757
00:58:23,769 --> 00:58:24,901
This is my style

758
00:58:27,449 --> 00:58:28,784
You don’t have to worry;

759
00:58:29,410 --> 00:58:30,769
I am there for you darling

760
00:58:35,349 --> 00:58:36,442
I will gulp one down first

761
00:58:51,192 --> 00:58:52,480
I am the king here,

762
00:58:53,067 --> 00:58:54,129
so who are you?

763
00:58:54,707 --> 00:58:55,691
So you are my queen

764
00:58:58,011 --> 00:58:58,518
Why are you moving away?

765
00:59:00,106 --> 00:59:00,871
What is it?

766
00:59:01,379 --> 00:59:01,699
What?

767
00:59:03,731 --> 00:59:05,215
Don’t play around with me?

768
00:59:11,708 --> 00:59:13,137
I will life you and throw you

769
00:59:53,208 --> 00:59:54,372
Hey Muthu? Muthu?

770
00:59:55,146 --> 00:59:56,176
What happened, Muthu?

771
00:59:56,810 --> 00:59:57,551
Where is that girl?

772
00:59:58,044 --> 00:59:58,379
Muthu?

773
00:59:58,849 --> 00:59:59,169
Muthu?

774
00:59:59,388 --> 00:59:59,965
Hey, Zaheer Come

775
01:00:29,655 --> 01:00:29,944
Zaheer

776
01:02:50,628 --> 01:02:51,365
Hey Alex

777
01:02:53,889 --> 01:02:54,896
Oh, they let him off?

778
01:02:56,959 --> 01:02:58,099
it's ok, bye

779
01:02:59,475 --> 01:03:00,466
That Vivek has been let off

780
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:02,029
No

781
01:03:03,373 --> 01:03:04,701
I though he will be
behind bars for a bit more

782
01:03:06,014 --> 01:03:08,880
We will get him jailed,
we have enough options

783
01:03:20,374 --> 01:03:24,147
Sir, don’t feel bad about what
we are saying in such a situation

784
01:03:26,272 --> 01:03:27,827
For us her life is
of prime importance

785
01:03:30,171 --> 01:03:34,405
Case, investigation and all
will adversely affect her life

786
01:03:37,452 --> 01:03:41,748
We are ready to do anything,
please relieve her from this case.

787
01:03:47,191 --> 01:03:48,613
I took a case on your complaint

788
01:03:49,730 --> 01:03:51,956
Only on your suspicion
I arrested Vivek

789
01:03:52,605 --> 01:03:53,839
Now your daughter is back

790
01:03:54,206 --> 01:03:56,066
so you don’t have any
complaint. Nice

791
01:03:57,066 --> 01:03:57,542
See

792
01:03:58,699 --> 01:04:00,503
I will do the necessary
things to withdraw the case

793
01:04:01,066 --> 01:04:03,769
Please don’t keep coming
here regarding this.

794
01:04:08,507 --> 01:04:09,225
See Mr. Emmanuel,

795
01:04:09,655 --> 01:04:11,046
if you like to, you can
withdraw this case

796
01:04:11,663 --> 01:04:12,850
but since Anu is a minor,

797
01:04:13,045 --> 01:04:15,725
the police have all the rights to
voluntarily register a case

798
01:04:17,062 --> 01:04:18,631
On that regard we will
again come here,

799
01:04:19,186 --> 01:04:21,678
but that time, we would be
dealing in a different way.

800
01:04:22,663 --> 01:04:23,046
Bharatan

801
01:04:35,980 --> 01:04:37,415
A fake seer, who sexually
abused a 16 old boy

802
01:04:37,471 --> 01:04:39,367
on the pretext of curing the
boys illness through his prayers,

803
01:04:39,392 --> 01:04:41,823
from Thrikkunnapuzha in Alappuzha
district, today Morning

804
01:04:42,246 --> 01:04:45,043
The Fake seer, Abdul karim, hails
from pathanapuram in Kollam district

805
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:47,759
He was arrested by the Police
under the POSCO act,

806
01:04:48,112 --> 01:04:48,620
In the morning ,

807
01:04:48,628 --> 01:04:53,424
Abdul karim visited the house of the
victim and enquired about the family

808
01:04:53,817 --> 01:04:55,387
The plus one student’s
mother informed the fake seer

809
01:04:55,434 --> 01:04:57,223
that her son is
suffering from fever

810
01:04:57,645 --> 01:04:59,192
Abdul Karim, on convincing her that

811
01:04:59,217 --> 01:05:02,395
he can cure the boy with his prayers
took him in to a room and abused him

812
01:05:02,919 --> 01:05:06,533
By the time the neighbours rushed to the house,
hearing the mothers loud cry

813
01:05:07,580 --> 01:05:10,556
Welcome Sunita Prabhakar,
Reporter of Sky news

814
01:05:12,955 --> 01:05:15,087
This is an amazing surprise

815
01:05:15,588 --> 01:05:17,945
I have been trying to get through to you
on the phone for the last two months.

816
01:05:18,586 --> 01:05:19,531
Where were you?

817
01:05:20,078 --> 01:05:23,061
Babe, my job is not to walk around
holding a mike, like you do

818
01:05:23,335 --> 01:05:27,405
Nobody can predict when a private
detectives phone might get turned off

819
01:05:27,655 --> 01:05:28,749
Won’t ask you about more things.

820
01:05:29,015 --> 01:05:30,233
What is the idea
behind your arrival?

821
01:05:32,726 --> 01:05:37,726
I am chasing a chase, which can’t be
said to be murder or unnatural death

822
01:05:43,460 --> 01:05:45,514
One Mr. Mohammed from Malappuram

823
01:05:45,905 --> 01:05:47,671
who was working as
sale man in Dubai,

824
01:05:48,398 --> 01:05:50,428
went missing suddenly one day

825
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:54,030
After three days, his corpse
was brought home

826
01:05:54,882 --> 01:05:56,014
When his body was being bathed,

827
01:05:56,093 --> 01:06:01,749
relatives saw many
surgical marks on the body

828
01:06:02,288 --> 01:06:04,493
They approached
me with this case

829
01:06:05,032 --> 01:06:09,048
After some days,
his family got 25 lakhs

830
01:06:09,564 --> 01:06:11,876
Once they saw the money
they backed out of the case,

831
01:06:12,626 --> 01:06:15,423
but I for some reason,
didn’t feel like leaving this case

832
01:06:15,962 --> 01:06:18,024
I continued my investigation and
found out that, not just Mohammed

833
01:06:18,392 --> 01:06:21,677
but two more Malayali employees
from the same supermarket

834
01:06:21,819 --> 01:06:23,427
had gone missing under
the same circumstances

835
01:06:23,951 --> 01:06:28,099
One Mr. Gopi from Trivandrum
and Juby from Wayanad

836
01:06:28,676 --> 01:06:31,129
You mean, similar operation
marks on their body too?

837
01:06:31,723 --> 01:06:32,816
Yes, it was there.

838
01:06:33,286 --> 01:06:35,231
Even their families
got 25 lakhs,

839
01:06:35,934 --> 01:06:38,191
from Golden hands
charitable trust

840
01:06:39,294 --> 01:06:43,863
I once attempted to do an exclusive
story on this charitable trust

841
01:06:44,317 --> 01:06:44,535
Okay

842
01:06:45,868 --> 01:06:47,470
The Binami’s of this
charitable trust owns,

843
01:06:47,947 --> 01:06:52,251
super markets, construction companies
and hospitals in the gulf

844
01:06:52,829 --> 01:06:57,053
dead bodies are supplied to medical
colleges from the old age homes run by them

845
01:06:57,319 --> 01:06:59,787
I received information
from a true source

846
01:07:00,058 --> 01:07:01,471
I did an exclusive story

847
01:07:01,855 --> 01:07:03,174
The channel did not air it

848
01:07:03,550 --> 01:07:04,549
When I enquired about it,

849
01:07:04,667 --> 01:07:07,784
it was the same Golden hands
charitable trust behind it

850
01:07:08,292 --> 01:07:12,065
Hmm yes. Many similar allegations like
this had come up against this trust,

851
01:07:12,822 --> 01:07:16,940
but for this case, i think they are
involved in Donor Mafia

852
01:07:18,117 --> 01:07:18,249
Okay

853
01:07:18,367 --> 01:07:22,140
I understood that all three of
them had lost their internal organs

854
01:07:22,410 --> 01:07:24,640
So same people, same company,

855
01:07:25,117 --> 01:07:26,780
Golden hands charitable trust

856
01:07:28,265 --> 01:07:29,585
I feel that there
is some connection

857
01:07:29,922 --> 01:07:30,070
Okay

858
01:07:38,275 --> 01:07:41,282
Master I know that you have
started hearing bad news there too

859
01:07:41,658 --> 01:07:43,313
That lady detective
is also missing.

860
01:07:43,993 --> 01:07:45,016
Don’t know what to do

861
01:07:45,922 --> 01:07:46,516
Hire a Contract killer

862
01:07:48,932 --> 01:07:52,299
The police department also is suspicious
about the activities of Golden hands,

863
01:07:52,518 --> 01:07:56,822
but without any strong
evidence, we can’t do anything

864
01:07:57,042 --> 01:07:57,885
I know that.

865
01:07:57,940 --> 01:07:58,854
My idea was to find out

866
01:07:58,940 --> 01:08:02,681
the full details of the trust,
including the pre medical camps they held

867
01:08:02,706 --> 01:08:04,119
whether you can collect for me

868
01:08:05,534 --> 01:08:07,119
Okay, I will try. Anything more?

869
01:08:28,351 --> 01:08:29,569
Hmm, okay

870
01:08:32,169 --> 01:08:34,887
Jagan, you be careful

871
01:08:35,231 --> 01:08:36,176
They are too dangerous

872
01:09:18,985 --> 01:09:19,329
Come in

873
01:09:25,291 --> 01:09:27,267
You guys sit, I will bring
something to drink

874
01:09:35,952 --> 01:09:37,929
Anu, what happened to you?

875
01:09:38,320 --> 01:09:39,663
Why are you not
stepping out at all?

876
01:09:41,788 --> 01:09:43,312
We all really miss you

877
01:09:45,453 --> 01:09:45,765
Anu?

878
01:09:50,761 --> 01:09:51,135
Anu...

879
01:09:56,972 --> 01:10:01,089
Anu, why are you
avoiding us like this?

880
01:10:05,449 --> 01:10:07,386
We can’t bear to
see you like this

881
01:10:14,431 --> 01:10:15,642
What happened to you, Anu?

882
01:10:16,806 --> 01:10:19,768
Anu, did you know ,
in our boney’s class

883
01:10:29,447 --> 01:10:30,900
She has been like
this for some days

884
01:10:31,658 --> 01:10:32,361
Don’t worry,

885
01:10:33,065 --> 01:10:33,845
she will become all right

886
01:10:40,733 --> 01:10:42,037
What is t? What happened?

887
01:10:49,194 --> 01:10:49,725
Aunty, I will be back in a bit

888
01:10:50,296 --> 01:10:51,522
What is it? Say what it is?

889
01:10:51,539 --> 01:10:52,414
no aunty, nothing

890
01:10:55,115 --> 01:10:55,897
Where did they go?

891
01:10:58,125 --> 01:11:01,515
Brother Vivek, Brother Vivek,
this has some videos of Anu in it.

892
01:11:02,516 --> 01:11:02,851
What is it?

893
01:11:03,245 --> 01:11:03,463
That

894
01:11:05,604 --> 01:11:06,002
What is in it?

895
01:11:07,323 --> 01:11:07,666
Check it

896
01:11:25,898 --> 01:11:26,242
Come

897
01:11:32,488 --> 01:11:34,560
Come, Arjun you come with me.
Rahul, you stay here

898
01:11:57,672 --> 01:11:58,875
Brother Vivek, that’s the place

899
01:11:59,892 --> 01:12:00,142
Is this?

900
01:12:05,374 --> 01:12:06,361
Are you sure that,
this is the place?

901
01:12:06,463 --> 01:12:06,798
Yes, this is the place

902
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:54,979
Hmmm...

903
01:13:56,143 --> 01:13:56,416
Okay

904
01:13:57,722 --> 01:13:57,838
Right

905
01:14:00,511 --> 01:14:04,620
A total of 740 camps have been conducted
under chengannoor foundation in Kerala.

906
01:14:05,058 --> 01:14:09,432
From 737 camps out of them, nothing
like what we suspected has been reported

907
01:14:10,354 --> 01:14:11,455
From 3 camps,

908
01:14:13,542 --> 01:14:14,463
Nadakkavu in Kozhikode,

909
01:14:14,690 --> 01:14:15,573
Mannuthy in Thrissur

910
01:14:15,854 --> 01:14:16,815
and Perumbavoor in Ernakulam

911
01:14:17,089 --> 01:14:19,479
from these three, one person
each has gone missing.

912
01:14:24,229 --> 01:14:26,424
Though the characteristics of
all three cases are the same,

913
01:14:27,206 --> 01:14:29,080
but we are unable
to find a link.

914
01:14:30,003 --> 01:14:30,362
So...

915
01:14:31,128 --> 01:14:33,041
we need to find out
how to move ahead now.

916
01:14:33,651 --> 01:14:37,159
I don’t think that these missing case
and the blood bank have any connection

917
01:14:38,847 --> 01:14:42,784
In India, no private person
can run a blood bank on his own

918
01:14:43,284 --> 01:14:43,971
That is the rule

919
01:14:44,964 --> 01:14:46,815
Then these many number
of blood donation camps

920
01:14:48,065 --> 01:14:49,776
There is something else
going on behind this

921
01:14:50,901 --> 01:14:53,034
Jagan, tell me one of
the missing persons name

922
01:14:53,339 --> 01:14:55,635
The guy who went missing
from Kozhikode is Ratish

923
01:15:00,236 --> 01:15:01,337
Tell me the other two names

924
01:15:02,874 --> 01:15:05,563
Athira Gagan Gokul,
She is from Assam

925
01:15:12,867 --> 01:15:15,766
Got it. A rare blood group,
Bombay O Positive

926
01:15:17,063 --> 01:15:19,117
All the three people who went
missing have this same blood group

927
01:15:19,899 --> 01:15:24,063
All over India, there are only fewer than
400 people with this rare blood group

928
01:15:28,071 --> 01:15:31,081
Their organs sell for crore’s
in the international market

929
01:15:32,754 --> 01:15:34,526
Can you check and tell whether there
is anyone else with this blood group

930
01:15:38,644 --> 01:15:39,558
There is one more person

931
01:15:41,394 --> 01:15:41,526
Shit

932
01:15:47,392 --> 01:15:47,798
Sir, this?

933
01:15:48,455 --> 01:15:48,579
Yes

934
01:15:49,517 --> 01:15:50,360
Jagan, do you know this kid?

935
01:15:51,048 --> 01:15:53,274
Can you check the date and tell me
when she took part in this camp?

936
01:15:56,070 --> 01:15:57,155
If we get the details

937
01:15:58,242 --> 01:15:59,960
Yes, Thirteenth of this month

938
01:16:02,413 --> 01:16:03,352
Jagan, what happened?

939
01:16:04,564 --> 01:16:06,376
Yes, on this 15th even
this kid got kidnapped

940
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:09,641
but the very next day she escaped
from their clutches and came back

941
01:16:10,712 --> 01:16:13,891
I figured out that she was abducted by
a Tamilian and two Hindi speaking guys

942
01:16:14,181 --> 01:16:15,704
Yes Jagan, this is that for sure

943
01:16:15,986 --> 01:16:17,509
That kid would have
seen her kidnappers,

944
01:16:17,923 --> 01:16:19,579
through her we can
reach those guys

945
01:16:19,962 --> 01:16:21,095
I am sure, Jagan.

946
01:16:22,251 --> 01:16:23,173
There is a problem in it

947
01:16:23,759 --> 01:16:26,352
This kid’s family is not
interested in pursuing the case

948
01:16:27,734 --> 01:16:29,407
There is one way for it, let us see

949
01:16:57,454 --> 01:17:01,625
Any old paper, plastic,
iron scrap, bottles for sale?

950
01:17:10,284 --> 01:17:13,550
Any iron scrap, tin,
bottles and things for sale?

951
01:17:16,105 --> 01:17:17,561
Paper, paper

952
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:35,280
Any iron scrap, tin, bottles
and things for sale?

953
01:17:38,317 --> 01:17:39,863
Paper , Paper

954
01:22:13,700 --> 01:22:13,871
Hey,

955
01:22:16,364 --> 01:22:16,707
what is it?

956
01:22:17,301 --> 01:22:18,270
Hey, leave me

957
01:22:35,941 --> 01:22:37,198
Sir, sir, tell me the reason sir

958
01:22:38,644 --> 01:22:39,730
leave me, leave

959
01:22:40,511 --> 01:22:40,784
hey

960
01:22:40,871 --> 01:22:41,300
leave

961
01:22:42,066 --> 01:22:42,237
hey

962
01:22:43,949 --> 01:22:44,378
Leave me

963
01:22:46,120 --> 01:22:47,651
Sir , Sir, please

964
01:23:34,169 --> 01:23:37,083
Oh okay. So you are
behind this also

965
01:23:37,903 --> 01:23:38,575
Haven’t you had enough?

966
01:23:39,896 --> 01:23:40,622
You destroyed my life,

967
01:23:41,521 --> 01:23:42,325
finished off my career;

968
01:23:43,292 --> 01:23:44,582
you made it impossible
for me to step out

969
01:23:45,474 --> 01:23:46,356
What more do you want?

970
01:23:47,474 --> 01:23:49,165
Sit Vivek, l want to
tell you something

971
01:23:49,922 --> 01:23:51,047
I don’t want to hear anything.
I want to leave

972
01:23:52,790 --> 01:23:53,079
Vivek!

973
01:23:55,611 --> 01:23:57,329
Your investigation is never
going to reach anywhere

974
01:24:00,439 --> 01:24:03,048
Anu wasn’t kidnapped by a small
gang, like you believe.

975
01:24:04,165 --> 01:24:05,110
It’s a big Mafia

976
01:24:07,184 --> 01:24:08,277
Anu is not their first victim

977
01:24:09,245 --> 01:24:11,284
To reach them,
I need your help

978
01:24:58,957 --> 01:25:01,035
No Vivek, it won’t work out.

979
01:25:03,207 --> 01:25:04,472
I know what i did
to you was wrong

980
01:25:04,699 --> 01:25:05,222
I agree

981
01:25:06,675 --> 01:25:08,620
In that state of mine, things
happened that way

982
01:25:09,221 --> 01:25:10,159
Please forgive me

983
01:25:11,026 --> 01:25:14,174
In the name of this I can’t
send Anu along with you

984
01:25:14,597 --> 01:25:16,237
I don’t know when Emmanuel
is going to be here

985
01:25:16,737 --> 01:25:17,815
Vivek, you leave

986
01:25:17,933 --> 01:25:18,291
No Aunty,

987
01:25:18,831 --> 01:25:20,737
Without Anu I won’t
step out from this flat

988
01:25:21,862 --> 01:25:23,807
All your issues are sorted, but
my situation is not like that

989
01:25:24,706 --> 01:25:26,752
I want to know who and
what is behind all this

990
01:25:27,378 --> 01:25:28,588
All that won’t work out, Vivek

991
01:25:29,276 --> 01:25:29,870
It better work out

992
01:25:31,073 --> 01:25:33,284
I will see to that your daughter is unscathed

993
01:25:35,042 --> 01:25:35,745
You should trust me

994
01:30:12,802 --> 01:30:14,630
No, nothing can be said now.

995
01:30:14,866 --> 01:30:16,498
Will let you know if i get any information

996
01:30:22,063 --> 01:30:23,695
Hope there are no problems
at Anu’s place?

997
01:30:24,430 --> 01:30:25,062
No problems there

998
01:30:25,429 --> 01:30:26,289
Did he say anything?

999
01:30:26,758 --> 01:30:28,172
Till now he hasn’t been asked anything

1000
01:30:28,507 --> 01:30:28,811
Why is that?

1001
01:30:29,242 --> 01:30:32,132
First beating up and then questions,
that’s his way

1002
01:30:36,838 --> 01:30:37,041
Say,

1003
01:30:38,674 --> 01:30:39,259
say everything

1004
01:30:45,359 --> 01:30:46,897
Rana Bhai and Master

1005
01:30:47,867 --> 01:30:49,616
In that Rana bhai would probably
be a thread like him,

1006
01:30:52,843 --> 01:30:53,554
but master

1007
01:31:23,887 --> 01:31:24,582
Sir Maalu

1008
01:31:24,927 --> 01:31:25,989
You quickly make her safe

1009
01:31:40,056 --> 01:31:40,251
Oh no

1010
01:31:41,596 --> 01:31:41,916
Vivek,

1011
01:31:43,705 --> 01:31:44,080
what happened?

1012
01:31:45,111 --> 01:31:45,658
She is disconnecting the call

1013
01:31:46,213 --> 01:31:46,462
Vivek

1014
01:31:47,150 --> 01:31:47,869
Got her location

1015
01:31:48,502 --> 01:31:49,369
It says that she is in Gold souk

1016
01:31:50,815 --> 01:31:51,158
Hello

1017
01:31:51,291 --> 01:31:51,868
Who passes on the
information so accurately?

1018
01:31:51,893 --> 01:31:52,408
where are you now

1019
01:31:53,315 --> 01:31:53,814
Stay right there.

1020
01:31:54,447 --> 01:31:54,806
I will come there now

1021
01:31:54,915 --> 01:31:55,900
Vivek, don’t go alone

1022
01:35:14,599 --> 01:35:15,044
What dude?

1023
01:35:15,278 --> 01:35:15,762
What happened?

1024
01:35:17,825 --> 01:35:20,794
You thought that some people
would have kidnapped me?

1025
01:35:22,195 --> 01:35:23,312
Your programme is done, right?
let’s go

1026
01:35:23,445 --> 01:35:24,061
Please get the bill

1027
01:36:11,920 --> 01:36:12,324
Yes Vivek,

1028
01:36:12,833 --> 01:36:13,098
tell me

1029
01:36:14,512 --> 01:36:14,777
Is it?

1030
01:36:16,317 --> 01:36:18,098
Drop Malavika back to
her flat and then call me

1031
01:36:18,340 --> 01:36:18,769
I will send it

1032
01:36:19,895 --> 01:36:20,613
Okay, bye

1033
01:36:21,692 --> 01:36:23,434
Malavika is safe,
she is with Vivek

1034
01:36:24,301 --> 01:36:25,481
You pass me that
Hindi guy’s phone

1035
01:36:27,239 --> 01:36:27,478
Here

1036
01:37:09,245 --> 01:37:11,799
Maalu, do you remember
when this photo taken??

1037
01:37:12,136 --> 01:37:12,495
Let me see

1038
01:37:17,467 --> 01:37:20,240
Yes, this was taken on
our flats Anniversary day

1039
01:37:21,022 --> 01:37:22,233
Flat’s Anniversary

1040
01:37:24,678 --> 01:37:25,941
See, Sheeba aunty is calling

1041
01:37:28,089 --> 01:37:28,581
Hello Aunty

1042
01:37:30,495 --> 01:37:31,323
Son Vivek,

1043
01:37:32,675 --> 01:37:34,862
Anu, Anu is missing

1044
01:37:35,566 --> 01:37:35,956
Aunty when?

1045
01:37:36,011 --> 01:37:37,346
I can’t see her any where here

1046
01:37:38,167 --> 01:37:39,237
Don’t worry, let me look

1047
01:37:45,109 --> 01:37:45,898
What? What happened?

1048
01:37:46,500 --> 01:37:47,460
Anu is missing again

1049
01:37:55,340 --> 01:37:55,715
Yes Vivek

1050
01:37:56,739 --> 01:37:57,566
Anu is missing again

1051
01:37:58,075 --> 01:37:58,324
What?

1052
01:37:59,887 --> 01:38:00,019
Shit

1053
01:38:00,403 --> 01:38:00,668
Jagan?

1054
01:38:08,381 --> 01:38:10,589
Sir, I will send you a number

1055
01:38:11,043 --> 01:38:12,496
Can you track the location
and send it to me

1056
01:38:13,965 --> 01:38:15,019
Okay Sir, I will send it right away

1057
01:38:54,310 --> 01:38:54,895
Hi Vivek

1058
01:38:55,474 --> 01:38:57,512
You remember about Sunday’s
programme, right?

1059
01:38:57,864 --> 01:38:58,614
Your should song should rock

1060
01:39:05,349 --> 01:39:05,740
Sorry?

1061
01:39:05,928 --> 01:39:07,833
I am Ancy, a social worker

1062
01:39:08,107 --> 01:39:09,466
I was the one who informed you, Sir

1063
01:45:48,869 --> 01:45:52,556
Sky net is today reporting a news,
which will literally shock Kerala

1064
01:45:53,057 --> 01:45:56,653
Donor Mafia, an Organ smuggling gang,
was arrested in Ernakulam

1065
01:45:56,997 --> 01:45:59,895
For organs they would commit any act
of extreme cruelty without any qualms

1066
01:45:59,966 --> 01:46:04,606
The gang was netted by Ernakulam Kasaba
inspector Jagannadan and his team

1067
01:46:04,763 --> 01:46:09,287
With this many people who were hiding under
masks of decency where brought to the book

1068
01:46:15,045 --> 01:46:15,490
Hello,

1069
01:46:16,699 --> 01:46:17,433
Hmmm

1070
01:46:18,371 --> 01:46:19,144
I came to know

1071
01:46:20,434 --> 01:46:21,214
Our country,

1072
01:46:22,027 --> 01:46:22,894
our laws

1073
01:46:25,184 --> 01:46:25,817
I am coming

1074
01:46:44,223 --> 01:46:48,910
Hello, someone is after us.
please keep an eye out
