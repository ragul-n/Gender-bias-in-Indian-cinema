1
00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:55,041
Here is your tea.

2
00:01:55,833 --> 00:01:57,750
How was your day, Appa?

3
00:01:58,583 --> 00:01:59,958
It was great.

4
00:02:00,583 --> 00:02:03,625
It was like building a temple.

5
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,958
I'm sad that the construction is over,

6
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:09,500
but I'm glad
that the temple has been built.

7
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:12,250
Grief is inevitable, hence there is bliss.

8
00:02:12,458 --> 00:02:13,333
Here.

9
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,500
No tea for me. I'd like some sherbet.

10
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:17,041
It's too hot.

11
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:19,333
Yes, too hot.

12
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:22,541
Too hot.

13
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:29,625
When the long shadows
of evil engulf the earth,

14
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:34,208
where will you find the abyss of darkness

15
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:38,166
to hide your gloomy, lying face?

16
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:41,875
You use a thousand faces,

17
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:45,000
It is only right

18
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,458
that you mask your ugly,
deceitful face with a smile.

19
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:54,583
Caesar or Brutus?

20
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:56,000
Pardon?

21
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:59,083
-Did you act as Caesar or Brutus?
-Why do you keep coming here?

22
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:00,208
Run along!

23
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:02,041
May I have some tea?

24
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:03,750
-What?
-Tea!

25
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:05,875
Don't yell. I am not deaf.

26
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:11,583
Blindness is an unwanted blessing.

27
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:15,916
It is the curse of being able to hear
that clings on.

28
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:19,958
<span style="style.default_1">Little baby, sweet child</span>

29
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:23,166
<span style="style.default_1">Wearing a bangle made of gold</span>

30
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:29,166
<span style="style.default_1">Let me put an anklet of silver
On your other foot</span>

31
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:33,750
Why are you following me?

32
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:36,500
I like talking to you.

33
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:40,125
Your words are pleasing to hear.

34
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:45,541
You told me your name the other day,
but I have forgotten it.

35
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:49,666
Are you testing me?

36
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:51,458
No, I honestly can't remember.

37
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:56,500
You are lying to me, aren't you?

38
00:03:57,291 --> 00:04:00,583
Lies and truth, no one really knows.

39
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:06,250
I am Keshav Murwadikar.
My family is originally from Baroda.

40
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:10,291
We used to run a theater canteen.

41
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,041
We moved to Sangli,

42
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:14,916
then went to Nagpur.

43
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,333
I've been doing this profession
for 40 years.

44
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:21,666
That is where I met these stalwarts.

45
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:23,083
Is that enough?

46
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:26,166
Now leave and don't come back.

47
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,125
-Don't come to see me again.
-I am sorry, please.

48
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:30,375
-Hey.
-Slap me if you want,

49
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:32,833
-What are you doing?
-but I want to see you again.

50
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:37,166
-I won't trouble you, but please meet me.
-People are staring at us. Get up.

51
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:39,375
Promise me that you will see me tomorrow.

52
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:41,000
Yes, I'll see you tomorrow.

53
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:42,208
Get up.

54
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:43,750
I know you won't stop bothering me.

55
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:46,416
I will have to leave this town.

56
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,708
I'll find you.

57
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:51,375
What is your name?

58
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,291
Siddharth.

59
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:58,916
The enlightened one.

60
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,208
So what do you do?

61
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:03,916
I have a master's degree in Technology.

62
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,958
I used to live in the US.

63
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,541
Okay, that's nice.

64
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,625
I worked there for seven or eight years.

65
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,208
But theater is my true calling.

66
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:14,250
Oh, God,

67
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:18,125
why do you make some people crazy?

68
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:20,375
I must leave.

69
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:22,958
I can drop you home.

70
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:24,833
Where do you live?

71
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:27,375
I'll let you know when I find it out.

72
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:34,958
-Ammi, give me the money.
-Hey! Go away. I'll hit you.

73
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:36,458
-Get up!
-Who is it?

74
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:40,500
You drunkard!
Why are you bothering Rukhsana?

75
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:43,041
-Why are you troubling her?
-Hey, what...

76
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:47,041
Hey. Why are you hitting him?

77
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:50,125
-Why is he bothering Rukhsana?
-She is my mother!

78
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:52,375
-Do you like troubling your mother?
-Calm down.

79
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:55,958
I am in pain. I need to see a doctor.

80
00:05:57,416 --> 00:06:00,166
Just give me a little money for medicine.

81
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:03,166
-Go.
-I'll go to a doctor.

82
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,458
-A doctor.
-Appa, why did you do that?

83
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:08,375
It's okay.

84
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:10,875
It's already late.
Everyone was worried about you.

85
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:13,708
A crazy fellow kept pestering me.

86
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:16,000
One day, you'll wander off
while muttering to yourself,

87
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:17,791
and get lost in the streets of Mumbai.

88
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:19,791
What do I have to lose?

89
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:21,666
Go get two glasses.

90
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:24,250
You seem to be making quite the bucks!

91
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:26,125
Hey, Rukhsana! Give me two glasses.

92
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:27,625
They are over there. Get them yourself.

93
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:32,791
Goodness.

94
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:36,458
Hey, old man! Are you getting any younger?

95
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:39,083
Finish your drinks quickly.

96
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,666
Dinner is almost ready.

97
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:43,875
And when it gets cold,
you refuse to eat it.

98
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:48,166
Rukhsana, anyone who wastes your food

99
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:51,708
is condemned to hell.

100
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:54,416
You're such a shrewd old man!

101
00:06:57,125 --> 00:07:02,291
I enjoy my life more than a bee does.

102
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:06,375
I enjoy my life more than a bee
that likes a nectar.

103
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:09,833
My body and soul are enlightened
by the warmth of this existence.

104
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:11,666
-Do you get it?
-Yes.

105
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:16,958
You, Almighty, fill me
with wisdom and understanding,

106
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:21,708
and envelope me with purity.

107
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:22,750
I hope this is pure too.

108
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,833
Appa!

109
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:54,666
Wake up.

110
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:56,083
Have this.

111
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:57,791
I am not hungry.

112
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,291
I brought this for you,
yet you say you're not hungry?

113
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:01,250
I don't want anything.

114
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:03,458
How can you take your medicines?

115
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:05,583
Get up and eat.

116
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:07,333
Come on, get up.

117
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:12,208
You know, Raja will yell at me.

118
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:13,541
Do you understand?

119
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:16,250
He works so hard for you.

120
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:18,333
He asks you to rest, but you don't listen.

121
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:20,125
You keep going to the tea stall.

122
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:22,875
How much does the owner pay you?

123
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:26,166
You work so hard,
but how much does he pay you?

124
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:27,500
Tell me.

125
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,750
You don't care about anything.

126
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,333
You spend all your earnings on alcohol.

127
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:38,166
You have aged, but have you matured?

128
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:41,250
Your wound hasn't healed yet.

129
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:44,250
I told you to go to a doctor,
but you don't listen.

130
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,375
You can't quit drinking alcohol.

131
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:49,875
Hey!

132
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:52,916
Why are you crying?

133
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:54,541
What did I say to make you cry?

134
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:56,875
Why are you crying?

135
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,916
Is it too spicy?

136
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:01,833
Say something!

137
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:04,875
I'll get you some water.

138
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:09,458
What did I say to make him cry?

139
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:13,041
I said what Raja told me to.

140
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:16,250
If I nag him for his sake,
he starts crying.

141
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:20,416
You must eat something
before taking your medicines.

142
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:26,500
Appa?

143
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:29,500
Where did he go?

144
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:41,041
-Banu, have you seen Appa?
-No.

145
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:42,291
Hey, old lady!

146
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:43,333
He flew away.

147
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,333
Shut up!

148
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:46,583
Salim, come here.

149
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:48,166
-Hurry up!
-Yes.

150
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:49,666
Go and get Raja, hurry.

151
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,791
Appa!

152
00:09:58,416 --> 00:09:59,708
Hey, step out.

153
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:03,375
-Where is Appa?
-I'm not lying, he lives here.

154
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:05,708
Rukhsana, where is Appa?

155
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:06,875
I don't know.

156
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:08,541
What do you mean?

157
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:10,916
I gave him some food

158
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,041
and asked him to eat,
so he can take his medicines.

159
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:14,833
It was spicy,
so I went to get him some water.

160
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:18,583
By the time, I came back, he was gone.

161
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,166
I swear he was right here.

162
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:24,500
Do you think we are fools?

163
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,208
Sir, what is this nonsense?

164
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:28,166
Get lost!

165
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:31,583
Tell me, where are you hiding him?

166
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:51,750
NATYA NIKETAN

167
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,208
Say it! I'm warning you!

168
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:11,791
Sir, why are you beating up
this poor fellow?

169
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:14,041
He only took care of him.

170
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:16,208
You're all so ungrateful.

171
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:20,333
Look. He was eating
just before he took off.

172
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,541
See for yourself. Come here and see.

173
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:26,666
Now, why are you crying?

174
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,041
NATYA NIKETAN BURNED TO ASHES

175
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,375
<span style="style.default_1">Hey, you divine forces!</span>

176
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:55,666
<span style="style.default_1">Give me the tenacity of rocks.</span>

177
00:11:57,666 --> 00:12:00,208
<span style="style.default_1">Bless me with patience.</span>

178
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:07,458
<span style="style.default_1">No, you ungrateful wretches, I won't cry.</span>

179
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:15,250
<span style="style.default_1">My heart will shatter to pieces
before I shed a tear,</span>

180
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:18,583
<span style="style.default_1">but King Lear won't show his grief.</span>

181
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:30,791
<span style="style.default_1">Let my heart blare with rage!</span>

182
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:22,375
Hello, everyone.

183
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:24,875
-Hello!
-Hello!

184
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:29,083
We have known each other
for the past 40 years.

185
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,833
But we have never had
a conversation like this,

186
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:38,375
so I am not sure how to address you.

187
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:42,291
Unlike Narayanrao, I will not address you

188
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:44,833
as generous patrons or benefactors.

189
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:49,083
That suited his agreeable image.

190
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:51,708
Actors like me,

191
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:54,916
we're like crude rocks.

192
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:59,083
Sugar-coating doesn't suit
our personality.

193
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:02,541
But to tell you the truth,
I don't like being too humble either.

194
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:10,291
You have loved me,
but did you do it as a favor?

195
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:12,833
No!

196
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:15,500
For the past 40 years,

197
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:17,875
every single night, with all my heart,

198
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:20,083
I have earned your love.

199
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:25,958
I have been blessed by so many stalwarts.

200
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:30,625
Annasaheb, Tatyasaheb, Bhau,
and a doctor...

201
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:32,958
"Ganpat, get me some tea!"

202
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:35,958
They would call out like that.

203
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:41,291
Serving tea to these demons
was my very first role.

204
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:48,583
I avidly watched their plays
from these very wings.

205
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:52,916
You may think I am exaggerating,

206
00:14:54,625 --> 00:15:00,875
but I truly believe
that this stage is a part of my destiny.

207
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:06,500
This stage makes me feel

208
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:09,583
as secured as I did in my mother's womb,

209
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:11,041
it comforts me.

210
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,333
I confess it is extremely difficult

211
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:16,458
to leave a wonderful audience
like you behind.

212
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,666
Unfortunately,
I have to stop at some point.

213
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:23,875
One must know when to stop,
and I think it's my time to do so.

214
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:31,000
This journey was eventful,
but I neglected my family.

215
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:33,958
My wife is present here,

216
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:35,958
I address her as Her Highness.

217
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:38,833
My son, his wife,
and his daughter are here too.

218
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:43,541
And so is Rambhau who held my hand
and led me into this career path,

219
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,666
and his wife Kumud.

220
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,125
I want to spend time with all of them.

221
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:52,041
They've made a lot of compromises for me
throughout their lives.

222
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:56,541
Now I want to spend
the rest of my life with them.

223
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,041
My friends,

224
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,958
you have given me a lot of love.

225
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,458
Loads of it.

226
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:07,916
I was a nobody,

227
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:11,458
just an ordinary actor
who merely scavenged upon

228
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:16,166
the vast wealth of words
created by the writers.

229
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:19,125
You've given me the title,
the King of Theater.

230
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,500
How do I repay this debt?

231
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:30,708
It hardly suits my personality,
but please accept my gratitude.

232
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,166
Thank you, everyone.

233
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:45,750
Hey, Ram,

234
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:47,708
are your knees hurting?

235
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:48,750
Hurting?

236
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:50,750
They're crying for help now.

237
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:54,250
We need to move the base
to the ground floor.

238
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:57,791
Get this over with.

239
00:16:58,625 --> 00:16:59,541
Good.

240
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:00,708
Please come in.

241
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:03,291
I don't like these rituals.

242
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,166
Who is going to wish bad luck upon me now?

243
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,625
Who wouldn't?

244
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,625
There were thousands of people
who turned up.

245
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:11,166
And you put up such a fake show!

246
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:14,541
Ram, you really think
I was just pretending?

247
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:16,375
Of course, and not only today,

248
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:21,125
you've been faking it
since the day you stepped on stage.

249
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,541
You are a half-baked actor.

250
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:24,708
Kumud.

251
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:27,166
He is like a suspicious dog

252
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:29,458
who thinks everyone is a thief.

253
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:32,958
Both of you are ridiculous!

254
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:34,416
Consider how old you are.

255
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:36,291
Tell that to your pig of a husband.

256
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:38,333
Slaughter him
and you could feed an entire village.

257
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:40,166
When you die,

258
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:43,166
I shall compliment you in the newspapers.

259
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:45,666
But I won't attend your funeral.

260
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,750
I would collapse carrying you, fatso!

261
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:49,791
Don't you come to my funeral

262
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:51,833
because I won't be going to yours.

263
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:53,583
-Deal?
-Deal!

264
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,875
Look at you, acting like children.

265
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:58,541
Let's go to the kitchen.

266
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:00,583
Neha, come with us.

267
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:02,791
-And what about me?
-No.

268
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:04,791
You'll pretend to have a taste
and finish all the food.

269
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:08,625
<span style="style.default_1">Don't think you are too smart.</span>

270
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:12,250
An actor keeps coming up with new ideas.

271
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:19,875
But a modest actor does the right thing
at the right time.

272
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:22,458
And you are not modest at all.

273
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:23,791
Do you get it?

274
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:28,166
You are not an exceptional actor.

275
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,208
That's true.

276
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:31,458
But you won us over.

277
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:33,291
You won our hearts over.

278
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:35,500
Ram, you moron!

279
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:41,166
I've retired
to hear these praises from you.

280
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:42,833
I'm honored!

281
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:47,333
You should retire too.

282
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:50,375
I don't need your useless advice.

283
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,541
I have a long way to go.

284
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:59,625
Until I reach a point
where I am content, I'll keep going.

285
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:01,500
Damn you!

286
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,750
I'm more handsome than you.

287
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,583
Yes, of course!

288
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:09,250
-You know I am a better actor than you.
-Right.

289
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:11,583
But you marched on and left us behind

290
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:14,625
and they crowned you
as the King of Theater.

291
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,625
You earned fame and fortune.

292
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:22,791
-I am happy for you.
-I can see that!

293
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:27,625
But keep your foolish advice to yourself.

294
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:30,583
I want to be greater than you.

295
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:33,541
Right. You jealous wretch.

296
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:39,666
An actor is responsible for his audience.

297
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:44,166
But I wasn't accountable only to them.

298
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,750
While standing on the stage,

299
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:48,833
I could see many faces,
sitting in the 15th or 16th row.

300
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:51,875
Shakespeare, Tatyasaheb,

301
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:54,333
Deval, and Gadkari!

302
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,541
They held a pack of chips in one hand,

303
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:01,125
and a single chip in another.

304
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,333
The mere sight of it had me raging.

305
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:09,458
All I wanted was
to do something extraordinary

306
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:13,041
that they should forget to eat the chip.

307
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,208
That is it.

308
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:21,458
It had been a journey of 40 years
as an actor,

309
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:24,500
but the real journey
was the trip of that chip

310
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:27,083
from the pack to their mouths.

311
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,458
I started getting anxious

312
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:32,958
that Tatyasaheb would finish off
the entire pack.

313
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:36,458
These thoughts were a sign

314
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:38,958
that I should stop.

315
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:41,416
Yes, you must stop now.

316
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:43,458
Come on,
everyone is waiting to have lunch.

317
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:46,416
-Sure.
-That is what I said to this idiot.

318
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:47,833
What's wrong with you?

319
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:49,875
-Hey!
-There's a time for everything.

320
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,625
Go ahead, set the table.

321
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:54,958
Let's go.

322
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,750
Finish your drink. Go on.

323
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:04,458
-What is it, Mother?
-Nothing.

324
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:08,625
Mother, please call Father,
I am dying out of hunger.

325
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:15,583
-Please, call him.
-Little sparrow, stop chirping, I'm here.

326
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:23,875
I have an announcement
to make before lunch.

327
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:25,541
What is it now?

328
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:28,791
Where is Her Highness? Oh, here she is.

329
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:33,541
No need to stand. Sit down.

330
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:36,791
-Sit down and say your piece.
-I should sit down? Okay.

331
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:40,458
I won't be staying at my house anymore.

332
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:42,458
That's it.

333
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:45,208
What do you mean?

334
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:51,375
From now on, I will be
staying at Makrand's house.

335
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:53,333
My house?

336
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:08,583
Today, I've transferred the ownership
of this house to you.

337
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,500
What?

338
00:22:11,166 --> 00:22:12,583
Was that necessary?

339
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:15,958
Yes. How could I live in your house
after I am dead?

340
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:17,750
Father, don't say that.

341
00:22:17,916 --> 00:22:19,083
Sorry, dear.

342
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,708
There is no greater joy
than seeing my son and his wife

343
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:27,250
live as they wish in their own house.

344
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:30,291
-Let me help you.
-It's not a real elephant!

345
00:22:30,541 --> 00:22:32,166
Neha, come here.

346
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:34,375
Come here.

347
00:22:34,708 --> 00:22:35,541
Hurry up.

348
00:22:36,375 --> 00:22:37,958
This is a copy of the agreement.

349
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:39,791
-But why so suddenly?
-Listen.

350
00:22:40,166 --> 00:22:42,875
Once you've decided, you must just do it.

351
00:22:45,458 --> 00:22:46,375
Dear.

352
00:22:47,041 --> 00:22:47,958
Listen, dear.

353
00:22:48,541 --> 00:22:50,708
Take this. Come on.

354
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:52,666
-What is this?
-This...

355
00:22:53,208 --> 00:22:54,166
Sit down.

356
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:58,833
Your father earned a lot,
but he spent it lavishly.

357
00:22:59,541 --> 00:23:02,833
Thanks to your mother,
we managed to save some of it.

358
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:08,458
Some savings, fixed deposits, shares,

359
00:23:08,666 --> 00:23:10,083
it's a decent amount.

360
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:11,791
-I don't want this.
-Why?

361
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:13,625
How could you give it all away?

362
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:16,708
What about you? Won't you need anything?

363
00:23:16,958 --> 00:23:18,625
You, my children, are here for me.

364
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:23,458
I want to retire completely.
What do you think, Ram?

365
00:23:25,291 --> 00:23:26,541
Very good.

366
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:29,041
-But you rushed it.
-You think so?

367
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,458
-Yes, you rushed it.
-Okay, I got it.

368
00:23:31,708 --> 00:23:33,750
You gave us everything.
But what about mother?

369
00:23:34,291 --> 00:23:37,041
She has me. Completely.

370
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:42,291
So, the poor woman still has to suffer.

371
00:23:42,666 --> 00:23:45,875
What are you saying? Mind your language.

372
00:23:46,791 --> 00:23:48,458
And learn something from him.

373
00:23:48,541 --> 00:23:50,875
Learning is useless.

374
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:53,416
At the moment, I don't have any property.

375
00:23:53,875 --> 00:23:56,833
And even if I did, I don't have
any children who will inherit it.

376
00:23:58,875 --> 00:24:00,166
What are you saying?

377
00:24:00,541 --> 00:24:01,541
Idiot!

378
00:24:02,458 --> 00:24:04,500
Don't start crying now.

379
00:24:05,958 --> 00:24:07,791
Shut up, pig.

380
00:24:09,291 --> 00:24:10,375
Kumud.

381
00:24:10,958 --> 00:24:13,708
Don't listen to this rascal.

382
00:24:14,291 --> 00:24:15,625
How irresponsible!

383
00:24:16,041 --> 00:24:17,458
So insensitive!

384
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:19,208
Shouldn't you consider other people?

385
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:21,333
Everyone was tired.

386
00:24:22,125 --> 00:24:24,958
Kumud was waiting to have lunch.

387
00:24:26,166 --> 00:24:27,416
No one is getting any younger.

388
00:24:28,208 --> 00:24:29,666
Medicines have to be taken after meals.

389
00:24:30,041 --> 00:24:31,458
I was wrong.

390
00:24:32,791 --> 00:24:34,583
Forgive me. I am sorry.

391
00:24:35,083 --> 00:24:37,041
Stop putting a show.

392
00:24:37,625 --> 00:24:38,958
Just go to bed.

393
00:24:39,125 --> 00:24:40,166
All right.

394
00:24:42,416 --> 00:24:45,291
Kaveri, today,

395
00:24:47,083 --> 00:24:49,125
the children were shocked
by my decision, weren't they?

396
00:24:50,166 --> 00:24:51,458
They were baffled.

397
00:24:53,208 --> 00:24:59,375
I don't think Ram quite liked my surprise.

398
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:03,458
I was a little apprehensive
about giving everything away as well.

399
00:25:06,791 --> 00:25:08,416
Well, what is the point
in planning everything?

400
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,958
Surprises are supposed to

401
00:25:10,333 --> 00:25:11,958
-shock you.
-Goodness!

402
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:14,250
Oh, dear!

403
00:25:14,583 --> 00:25:15,500
What is this?

404
00:25:15,583 --> 00:25:17,208
Take a look.

405
00:25:18,125 --> 00:25:19,125
Whom is it for?

406
00:25:19,666 --> 00:25:22,458
Who else would it be for? It's for you.

407
00:25:24,375 --> 00:25:25,458
Is it real gold?

408
00:25:25,541 --> 00:25:26,916
As real as you!

409
00:25:27,833 --> 00:25:29,416
This must be so expensive!

410
00:25:29,583 --> 00:25:31,458
Your Highness, don't say a word.

411
00:25:32,583 --> 00:25:34,166
All thanks to you,

412
00:25:34,875 --> 00:25:37,083
this wanderer was valued by everyone.

413
00:25:38,666 --> 00:25:42,166
You spent your life taking care of me.

414
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:46,708
This is all I can afford,

415
00:25:46,791 --> 00:25:49,041
otherwise, I would have showered you
with diamonds.

416
00:25:51,375 --> 00:25:52,791
It's beautiful!

417
00:25:53,583 --> 00:25:56,000
-It's like a string of stars.
-Wear it.

418
00:25:56,291 --> 00:25:57,291
Put it on.

419
00:26:03,541 --> 00:26:04,666
Oh, wow.

420
00:26:06,666 --> 00:26:07,583
Lovely.

421
00:26:07,958 --> 00:26:10,375
Now the necklace looks beautiful.

422
00:26:10,958 --> 00:26:12,791
Just a minute.

423
00:26:15,875 --> 00:26:18,833
Take a look, just like Desdemona.

424
00:26:20,166 --> 00:26:23,916
Everyone will be staring at you
at Vidya's wedding.

425
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,666
What do you mean?

426
00:26:27,041 --> 00:26:29,208
Yes, the groom's family called me.

427
00:26:30,625 --> 00:26:32,708
He said, "You decide everything.

428
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:35,416
We don't expect anything from you."
They said that, but of course, they do.

429
00:26:35,625 --> 00:26:37,250
Don't act smart!

430
00:26:38,166 --> 00:26:39,458
Why didn't you tell me?

431
00:26:39,916 --> 00:26:41,291
Tell you what?

432
00:26:43,541 --> 00:26:46,083
That fellow will snatch
our little sparrow from us.

433
00:26:46,166 --> 00:26:47,833
Should I be happy about it?

434
00:26:49,166 --> 00:26:52,083
I realized it the day he came home
to see Vidya.

435
00:26:52,166 --> 00:26:54,333
I noticed the way he was staring at her.

436
00:26:54,958 --> 00:26:56,958
I knew that rascal was bowled over.

437
00:26:57,416 --> 00:26:58,500
Mind your language.

438
00:26:59,125 --> 00:27:00,416
He is going to marry our daughter.

439
00:27:02,791 --> 00:27:04,875
He is seven years older than her.

440
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:08,625
You are ten years older than I am.

441
00:27:08,791 --> 00:27:09,916
It was all right at that time.

442
00:27:12,583 --> 00:27:13,666
He is an engineer.

443
00:27:14,625 --> 00:27:15,958
He has a good job.

444
00:27:17,083 --> 00:27:18,041
And actors like us

445
00:27:19,416 --> 00:27:20,791
are bloody beggars.

446
00:27:20,958 --> 00:27:21,875
Go to bed.

447
00:28:09,458 --> 00:28:10,375
You're back?

448
00:28:10,666 --> 00:28:13,708
Did you think I will stop following you?

449
00:28:14,583 --> 00:28:16,416
Are you the Devil Incarnate?

450
00:28:16,666 --> 00:28:17,958
Why are you pestering me?

451
00:28:18,333 --> 00:28:20,708
Let me die in peace. Go away.

452
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:23,333
Just go away. Get lost!

453
00:28:23,625 --> 00:28:24,750
Leave me alone.

454
00:28:27,666 --> 00:28:29,250
Didn't I tell you?

455
00:28:31,208 --> 00:28:33,291
You are lying to me.

456
00:28:35,041 --> 00:28:36,250
Ganpatrao!

457
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,750
Siddharth,

458
00:28:58,041 --> 00:29:01,291
you knew why I'm grieving, didn't you?

459
00:29:03,083 --> 00:29:06,416
The end is near,
but I am tied in these bonds.

460
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:12,666
Your life is trapped in it.

461
00:29:14,666 --> 00:29:15,833
Set it free.

462
00:29:19,875 --> 00:29:21,958
Suppressed grief is a double-edged sword.

463
00:29:24,875 --> 00:29:27,333
Relive your memories
and move on from them.

464
00:29:36,916 --> 00:29:37,958
Her Highness.

465
00:29:42,541 --> 00:29:43,708
Her Highness.

466
00:29:57,041 --> 00:29:57,875
Father!

467
00:29:58,333 --> 00:29:59,333
Bless you.

468
00:30:03,791 --> 00:30:05,875
-Mother.
-Please accept my respect.

469
00:30:08,375 --> 00:30:10,125
Take care of our little sparrow.

470
00:30:10,458 --> 00:30:11,291
Yes.

471
00:30:14,083 --> 00:30:17,541
Love her like we do,
and she will make you very happy.

472
00:30:18,708 --> 00:30:20,083
One more thing.

473
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:22,625
If you make her cry,

474
00:30:24,083 --> 00:30:26,750
remember that I've played
many villain roles onstage.

475
00:30:28,458 --> 00:30:29,333
Yes.

476
00:30:29,916 --> 00:30:31,500
-Let them go.
-Fine.

477
00:30:31,958 --> 00:30:32,875
Let's go.

478
00:30:33,958 --> 00:30:34,958
Go, my child.

479
00:30:36,333 --> 00:30:37,250
Hello.

480
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:27,208
Ram.

481
00:31:38,625 --> 00:31:39,541
I'll hit you!

482
00:31:40,291 --> 00:31:42,958
Sit down and relax.

483
00:31:48,833 --> 00:31:50,125
The little sparrow has flown away.

484
00:31:50,916 --> 00:31:52,500
He is a good man.

485
00:31:54,375 --> 00:31:55,750
He'll take care of her.

486
00:31:57,416 --> 00:31:59,208
And she hasn't gone abroad.

487
00:31:59,875 --> 00:32:03,500
When a daughter gets married
and gets out of the nest,

488
00:32:04,208 --> 00:32:05,791
she goes far away.

489
00:32:08,125 --> 00:32:10,916
You can still see her,
but she is no longer yours.

490
00:32:11,291 --> 00:32:12,708
You won't understand.

491
00:32:14,125 --> 00:32:15,250
Yes, I won't!

492
00:32:17,416 --> 00:32:18,250
You are right.

493
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:20,375
Only you know how it feels.

494
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:22,541
You have a daughter

495
00:32:24,458 --> 00:32:25,958
and also a son as a bonus!

496
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,041
You rascal,

497
00:32:30,875 --> 00:32:32,541
how can you grieve for your stolen shoes

498
00:32:32,625 --> 00:32:34,750
in front of a man without legs?

499
00:32:36,125 --> 00:32:40,416
Can't you act as if everything is normal
at least in front of me?

500
00:32:40,916 --> 00:32:43,333
According to you,
I am a third-grade actor.

501
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,958
Yes, that is true.

502
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:49,708
Listen.

503
00:32:50,125 --> 00:32:51,250
Let's have a drink.

504
00:32:54,125 --> 00:32:56,291
In the middle of the day?

505
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:01,208
<span style="style.default_1">-Hello!
-Father, this is Makrand.</span>

506
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,708
<span style="style.default_1">I have a baby girl now!</span>

507
00:33:02,833 --> 00:33:05,375
<span style="style.default_1">So, I have a granddaughter now.
I'm coming!</span>

508
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,041
Oh, wonderful!

509
00:33:10,333 --> 00:33:11,750
How are you?

510
00:33:12,625 --> 00:33:15,458
She looks just like me.

511
00:33:19,041 --> 00:33:20,500
Look at her!

512
00:33:20,875 --> 00:33:24,500
My little sparrow is back.

513
00:33:25,625 --> 00:33:27,875
Come on, take a photo.

514
00:33:28,625 --> 00:33:29,541
Go ahead.

515
00:33:30,666 --> 00:33:32,833
Please stop it.
The flash is bad for the baby.

516
00:33:33,083 --> 00:33:35,791
Not at all.
She is an actor's granddaughter.

517
00:33:35,958 --> 00:33:38,708
She must get used to the camera.
You go ahead.

518
00:33:41,666 --> 00:33:43,500
Grandma,

519
00:33:43,708 --> 00:33:44,958
here you go.

520
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:47,250
-Look at her!
-Little princess!

521
00:33:47,583 --> 00:33:49,625
What should we call you?

522
00:33:51,583 --> 00:33:53,125
Don't cry.

523
00:34:06,666 --> 00:34:09,125
<span style="style.default_1">With little eyes</span>

524
00:34:09,333 --> 00:34:15,041
<span style="style.default_1">That see the world</span>

525
00:34:17,166 --> 00:34:24,125
<span style="style.default_1">She has just begun her life</span>

526
00:34:27,916 --> 00:34:30,250
<span style="style.default_1">With little eyes</span>

527
00:34:30,666 --> 00:34:33,375
<span style="style.default_1">That see the world</span>

528
00:34:33,458 --> 00:34:36,708
There is my fairy. Say bye to your mother.

529
00:34:37,541 --> 00:34:40,750
Not like that, Grandpa.
Carry me like a sack of potatoes!

530
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:45,833
-Potatoes for sale!
-Bye, Mother!

531
00:34:46,833 --> 00:34:48,708
Onions for sale!

532
00:34:48,958 --> 00:34:54,375
<span style="style.default_1">I am about to play a new role</span>

533
00:34:54,458 --> 00:34:59,166
<span style="style.default_1">That will fill my life with immense joy</span>

534
00:34:59,458 --> 00:35:04,875
<span style="style.default_1">I am about to play a new role</span>

535
00:35:04,958 --> 00:35:09,666
<span style="style.default_1">That will fill my life with immense joy</span>

536
00:35:13,333 --> 00:35:15,125
Come on, Grandpa. Tell me.

537
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,500
Banana.

538
00:35:22,791 --> 00:35:25,541
-Wrong! Hold out your hand!
-Oh, god!

539
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:28,500
Oh, dear!

540
00:35:31,291 --> 00:35:32,666
My darling!

541
00:35:34,333 --> 00:35:39,583
<span style="style.default_1">This new beginning and new story</span>

542
00:35:39,666 --> 00:35:44,750
<span style="style.default_1">This is a new and lovely role of a grandpa</span>

543
00:35:45,291 --> 00:35:52,250
<span style="style.default_1">As I get absorbed in this new role
I bloom with immense joy...</span>

544
00:35:52,791 --> 00:35:54,083
Hey, my sparrow!

545
00:35:54,166 --> 00:35:55,000
Yes?

546
00:35:56,875 --> 00:35:57,875
Grandpa!

547
00:35:57,958 --> 00:36:01,125
<span style="style.default_1">A new role</span>

548
00:36:01,208 --> 00:36:06,041
<span style="style.default_1">That will fill my life with immense joy</span>

549
00:36:06,125 --> 00:36:11,583
<span style="style.default_1">I am about to play a new role</span>

550
00:36:11,666 --> 00:36:16,500
<span style="style.default_1">Will fill my life with immense joy</span>

551
00:36:39,166 --> 00:36:40,750
Hello, who is it?

552
00:36:41,083 --> 00:36:42,625
<span style="style.default_1">Is your Grandpa there?</span>

553
00:36:42,791 --> 00:36:45,000
-Grandpa?
<span style="style.default_1">-Yes, darling.</span>

554
00:36:46,125 --> 00:36:48,500
Grandpa, it's for you.

555
00:36:48,791 --> 00:36:50,041
All right.

556
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:01,250
Ram.

557
00:37:11,208 --> 00:37:14,041
Brain hemorrhage
due to extremely high blood pressure.

558
00:37:15,791 --> 00:37:18,333
She is in a coma.

559
00:37:21,125 --> 00:37:22,500
She will be all right.

560
00:37:23,458 --> 00:37:24,958
What did the doctors say?

561
00:37:27,166 --> 00:37:28,000
The doctors say...

562
00:37:33,291 --> 00:37:34,458
Have you eaten?

563
00:37:36,458 --> 00:37:37,458
I am fine.

564
00:37:37,708 --> 00:37:38,958
I'll stay here.

565
00:37:39,916 --> 00:37:40,833
-You go.
-Come on.

566
00:37:41,708 --> 00:37:42,750
Come.

567
00:38:09,833 --> 00:38:11,125
Rambhau, this is your second bottle.

568
00:38:11,958 --> 00:38:13,958
-Should I get you some more?
-No.

569
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:18,666
Ganpat.

570
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:25,083
She never had to go to a hospital before.

571
00:38:27,666 --> 00:38:31,333
Thanks to my mother's nagging,

572
00:38:31,541 --> 00:38:33,583
she did see a few doctors.

573
00:38:35,291 --> 00:38:36,291
But finally,

574
00:38:37,333 --> 00:38:41,625
Mother found out it is me
who is infertile, not Kumud.

575
00:38:43,166 --> 00:38:46,458
That silenced everyone.

576
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,708
What if she were infertile?

577
00:38:53,625 --> 00:38:55,250
She went on constant trips to the doctor.

578
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,000
Perpetual hardship.

579
00:39:00,041 --> 00:39:04,333
She was the only one
with all the responsibilities,

580
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:06,166
and I was carefree.

581
00:39:08,041 --> 00:39:11,083
She would have faced everything bravely,

582
00:39:12,416 --> 00:39:14,000
if only

583
00:39:14,291 --> 00:39:17,083
her husband had been loyal.

584
00:39:18,875 --> 00:39:21,333
But I was a dirty cheat.

585
00:39:24,291 --> 00:39:26,583
I wanted to talk to her,

586
00:39:28,625 --> 00:39:33,541
confess everything,
and ask for her forgiveness.

587
00:39:34,625 --> 00:39:36,333
But look at her now.

588
00:39:38,083 --> 00:39:42,208
Ram, you have become wise
at the end of your life.

589
00:39:44,208 --> 00:39:47,958
If one had to sit and count,

590
00:39:48,625 --> 00:39:51,750
we have had more affairs than awards.

591
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:56,166
We are nothing but rascals.

592
00:39:57,125 --> 00:39:59,083
Hell awaits us.

593
00:40:01,625 --> 00:40:03,625
-Hey, Ganpat.
-What?

594
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,083
Tell the doctor...

595
00:40:07,125 --> 00:40:09,875
Tell him to save her.
Save her at any cost.

596
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:13,000
I shall take care of her
no matter what happens to her.

597
00:40:16,333 --> 00:40:18,333
I can't live without her.

598
00:40:22,541 --> 00:40:24,250
I'm used to having her around.

599
00:40:27,708 --> 00:40:31,083
What should I do?

600
00:40:33,125 --> 00:40:34,541
Please save her.

601
00:40:34,708 --> 00:40:37,416
-I'll take care of her.
-Yes.

602
00:40:49,541 --> 00:40:52,083
Why do they let this idiot play?

603
00:40:56,333 --> 00:40:58,458
Sweetheart, you are home!

604
00:41:01,583 --> 00:41:02,791
What's wrong?

605
00:41:04,208 --> 00:41:05,916
Won't you talk to me?

606
00:41:06,125 --> 00:41:07,666
Are you angry?

607
00:41:08,166 --> 00:41:09,708
What's wrong, darling?

608
00:41:10,833 --> 00:41:13,000
Sagar yells cuss words at me every day.

609
00:41:13,666 --> 00:41:15,708
-Tell that to the teacher.
-I did.

610
00:41:15,791 --> 00:41:19,125
She already scolded him.
But he hasn't stopped.

611
00:41:19,333 --> 00:41:21,541
And all the children laughed at me.

612
00:41:21,833 --> 00:41:23,250
Then you should do the same.

613
00:41:23,416 --> 00:41:24,833
But I don't know any cuss words.

614
00:41:25,291 --> 00:41:27,000
I'll teach you. I know a lot of them.

615
00:41:27,291 --> 00:41:28,958
Your Grandpa is here for you.

616
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:32,625
Your lesson begins today.

617
00:41:33,333 --> 00:41:35,666
Tell me. Which song do you know?

618
00:41:51,208 --> 00:41:52,083
Then?

619
00:42:00,708 --> 00:42:03,208
<span style="style.default_1">Sagar is a pig and chicken-shit fry</span>

620
00:42:03,458 --> 00:42:06,000
<span style="style.default_1">Sagar is a donkey, tell me why</span>

621
00:42:06,166 --> 00:42:08,458
<span style="style.default_1">Sagar is a monkey, stupid boy</span>

622
00:42:09,041 --> 00:42:10,791
What did you say?

623
00:42:13,666 --> 00:42:15,416
Sagar is not completely innocent.

624
00:42:16,458 --> 00:42:18,916
We have had complaints about his behavior.

625
00:42:20,458 --> 00:42:23,250
I can understand
why she would respond like this.

626
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:25,958
But gathering some students
and teaching them profanities,

627
00:42:26,416 --> 00:42:27,750
that's not a good behavior.

628
00:42:28,333 --> 00:42:29,791
It disrupts the school's order.

629
00:42:32,375 --> 00:42:33,583
I'll talk to her.

630
00:42:34,583 --> 00:42:35,916
I will teach her a lesson.

631
00:42:46,125 --> 00:42:48,541
<span style="style.default_1">Sagar is a pig and a chicken-shit fry</span>

632
00:42:48,791 --> 00:42:50,666
<span style="style.default_1">-Sagar is a donkey, tell me why...</span>
-Hey!

633
00:42:52,083 --> 00:42:53,250
Neha, what is this?

634
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:55,833
-A song.
-A song?

635
00:42:56,625 --> 00:42:57,458
Yes.

636
00:42:57,958 --> 00:42:58,791
What do you mean?

637
00:43:00,333 --> 00:43:01,791
Don't be mad at me.

638
00:43:02,291 --> 00:43:03,583
Ask your father.

639
00:43:04,208 --> 00:43:05,333
He taught her that song.

640
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:06,708
What?

641
00:43:07,291 --> 00:43:08,708
He did?

642
00:43:08,958 --> 00:43:11,000
Yes. Should I sing it again?

643
00:43:19,625 --> 00:43:24,291
<span style="style.default_1">Has no one seen Lord Krishna</span>

644
00:43:25,166 --> 00:43:30,166
<span style="style.default_1">Has no one seen Lord Krishna</span>

645
00:43:30,708 --> 00:43:32,500
<span style="style.default_1">Lord Krishna...</span>

646
00:43:32,583 --> 00:43:34,333
No breakfast, no tea?

647
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:35,625
Why?

648
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:37,625
What is the matter?

649
00:43:38,875 --> 00:43:40,000
Come on, tell me.

650
00:43:41,083 --> 00:43:42,333
What is it?

651
00:43:43,125 --> 00:43:44,708
Did you teach Megha any cuss words?

652
00:43:45,708 --> 00:43:47,875
Cuss words? Oh, yes!

653
00:43:48,791 --> 00:43:50,833
Idiot, fool, these aren't cuss words.

654
00:43:50,958 --> 00:43:53,000
My mother used them all the time.

655
00:43:53,666 --> 00:43:55,625
But that is not allowed in her school.

656
00:43:55,708 --> 00:43:57,666
My teacher used to say,

657
00:43:57,833 --> 00:44:00,333
"Ganpat, you scoundrel,
why don't you study?"

658
00:44:00,708 --> 00:44:02,000
It's an expression.

659
00:44:02,666 --> 00:44:05,916
Two words relay the exact emotion
that ten words can't.

660
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:08,208
"What do you think, you spineless pig?"

661
00:44:09,916 --> 00:44:11,500
Father, Megha is just a child.

662
00:44:11,583 --> 00:44:13,291
It's not right for her to learn those
at her age.

663
00:44:14,416 --> 00:44:16,625
Oh, so I should learn from you.

664
00:44:17,458 --> 00:44:20,208
Schools have their own rules.
This is not permissible.

665
00:44:20,791 --> 00:44:21,625
Is it?

666
00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:23,166
Well, I thought

667
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:25,958
a fight with cuss words would be better
than physically hurting each other.

668
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:30,041
They are children.
They will forget about it, right?

669
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:31,583
Am I right?

670
00:44:33,166 --> 00:44:35,833
Father, do you owe the wine shop money?

671
00:44:36,458 --> 00:44:39,916
Oh, yes.
I had forgotten my wallet at home.

672
00:44:40,458 --> 00:44:42,541
And you borrowed money
from the watchman too?

673
00:44:42,666 --> 00:44:44,458
He asked for it in front of everyone.

674
00:44:44,916 --> 00:44:47,000
Are you interrogating me?

675
00:44:48,208 --> 00:44:50,250
There was a poor hungry fellow
on the street.

676
00:44:50,333 --> 00:44:52,375
I asked the watchman to give him money,
I'll return it.

677
00:44:52,458 --> 00:44:53,583
What's wrong with that?

678
00:44:53,791 --> 00:44:55,833
No, nothing. I've returned the money.

679
00:44:56,166 --> 00:44:58,791
Is there anything else to discuss?

680
00:44:58,958 --> 00:45:01,041
-None, Grandpa.
-Exactly.

681
00:45:01,208 --> 00:45:03,333
You lazy bum, get me some tea.

682
00:45:03,916 --> 00:45:05,458
Sounds nice, doesn't it? Lazy bum.

683
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:08,291
Or imagine me saying,
"Your Highness, may I have some tea?"

684
00:45:08,541 --> 00:45:10,125
As if I were begging.

685
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:13,000
You witch, that wasn't for you.

686
00:45:14,375 --> 00:45:16,250
I said what's on your mind.
Are you happy now?

687
00:45:16,333 --> 00:45:17,958
You are ridiculous!

688
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:28,166
By the way, Rahul told us
that you have many stories of Anna.

689
00:45:28,458 --> 00:45:30,708
Anna was so amusing.

690
00:45:30,958 --> 00:45:35,416
-Menakabai had a funny habit.
-Right.

691
00:45:36,041 --> 00:45:38,416
Each time she met a man she used to say,

692
00:45:38,708 --> 00:45:41,916
"I dreamed of you last night."

693
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:46,000
And the men would be happy at the thought.

694
00:45:46,541 --> 00:45:47,958
One day, a man met Anna, he said,

695
00:45:48,125 --> 00:45:51,291
"Anna, I dreamed of you last night!"

696
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:54,250
Anna asked, "What was I doing?"

697
00:45:54,541 --> 00:45:55,750
"Oh, dear. Nothing."

698
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:59,958
Anna said, "Then it wasn't me!"

699
00:46:00,791 --> 00:46:01,916
Mr. Barve!

700
00:46:02,791 --> 00:46:04,625
-Sir, your boss is here.
-All right.

701
00:46:05,458 --> 00:46:06,958
-Call Father.
-Yes.

702
00:46:07,875 --> 00:46:08,833
Welcome.

703
00:46:12,041 --> 00:46:13,041
It's all thanks to you.

704
00:46:13,833 --> 00:46:15,541
Rahul is calling you.

705
00:46:15,791 --> 00:46:17,166
His boss, Mr. Dixit, is here.

706
00:46:18,625 --> 00:46:20,250
Such a funny man!

707
00:46:20,333 --> 00:46:22,000
-Come, let's go. I'll wait.
-That's a good one!

708
00:46:22,083 --> 00:46:23,791
-I will be back.
-Wow!

709
00:46:24,166 --> 00:46:26,041
Yes, Rahul, what is it?

710
00:46:26,458 --> 00:46:27,375
Come here, Father.

711
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:29,833
This is my boss, Mr. Dixit.

712
00:46:30,166 --> 00:46:31,250
-Hello.
-Hello.

713
00:46:35,833 --> 00:46:37,458
Who doesn't know him?

714
00:46:38,458 --> 00:46:41,333
Supporters like you have
given me this identity.

715
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:45,541
I'll be forgotten as time passes by.

716
00:46:45,666 --> 00:46:46,791
-Father.
-Father.

717
00:46:47,458 --> 00:46:49,750
Father, he wants to speak to you.

718
00:46:50,666 --> 00:46:51,958
-Take a seat.
-Yes.

719
00:46:52,583 --> 00:46:53,541
-Yes.
-Take a seat.

720
00:46:53,625 --> 00:46:56,083
What do you want?

721
00:46:56,875 --> 00:46:57,791
Yes?

722
00:46:58,125 --> 00:46:59,291
Ganpatrao!

723
00:46:59,875 --> 00:47:02,166
Actually, my son wants to meet you.

724
00:47:02,625 --> 00:47:04,000
Is that so? Why?

725
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:05,916
-Here, sir.
-Yes.

726
00:47:12,166 --> 00:47:14,541
He's taking his postgraduate degree
in London.

727
00:47:14,666 --> 00:47:16,625
-Okay.
-And he is specializing in theater.

728
00:47:17,333 --> 00:47:18,166
Nice.

729
00:47:18,708 --> 00:47:22,166
-This generation is exploring new things.
-Yes.

730
00:47:22,625 --> 00:47:23,500
Also,

731
00:47:23,916 --> 00:47:26,833
they're currently staging
<span style="style.default_1">A Streetcar Named Desire.</span>

732
00:47:27,041 --> 00:47:28,458
Tennessee Williams.

733
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:29,583
No.

734
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:31,458
<span style="style.default_1">A Streetcar Named Desire.</span>

735
00:47:32,833 --> 00:47:35,458
Yes, Tennessee Williams
is the writer of that play.

736
00:47:36,583 --> 00:47:37,541
I see.

737
00:47:38,625 --> 00:47:44,416
A 1947 play directed by Elia Kazan.
Marlon Brando was portrayed by Kowalski.

738
00:47:45,916 --> 00:47:47,291
It's an amazing play.

739
00:47:48,833 --> 00:47:52,458
The sexual overtones
of this writer are baffling.

740
00:47:53,625 --> 00:47:57,708
In the theaters here,
when it comes to sex, we're...

741
00:47:58,208 --> 00:48:00,333
So, will he be working there,
or is he going to come back?

742
00:48:00,541 --> 00:48:02,166
He wants to come back home.

743
00:48:02,333 --> 00:48:04,708
Then ask him to come back soon.

744
00:48:05,958 --> 00:48:07,708
This profession is like walking on fire.

745
00:48:07,791 --> 00:48:09,208
It has the power to ruin you.

746
00:48:10,291 --> 00:48:12,666
We have gone through very tough times.

747
00:48:16,625 --> 00:48:19,083
I would love to meet him.

748
00:48:19,708 --> 00:48:23,000
I always look forward to meeting men
as crazy as me!

749
00:48:28,166 --> 00:48:29,250
-Father.
-Yes, darling?

750
00:48:29,333 --> 00:48:30,958
You should stay with us for a few days.

751
00:48:31,375 --> 00:48:33,375
Mr. Dixit is an avid reader.

752
00:48:33,541 --> 00:48:35,875
You can share your experiences,
and we'll enjoy listening.

753
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,333
No, my dear.

754
00:48:38,958 --> 00:48:41,958
One shouldn't stay with their
son-in-law. Am I right, Mr. Dixit?

755
00:48:42,125 --> 00:48:42,958
Yes.

756
00:48:43,208 --> 00:48:44,375
Really?

757
00:48:44,958 --> 00:48:47,083
Then I'll come stay with you.

758
00:48:47,375 --> 00:48:49,541
-You'll leave him and come back home?
-Yes!

759
00:48:49,875 --> 00:48:51,458
She loves me so much.

760
00:48:52,541 --> 00:48:55,291
There are generally three reasons
for a divorce.

761
00:48:56,458 --> 00:48:57,625
Domestic fights,

762
00:48:57,875 --> 00:48:59,625
adultery,

763
00:49:00,041 --> 00:49:01,291
or impotency.

764
00:49:01,708 --> 00:49:03,625
Choose the one that suits you best.

765
00:49:06,458 --> 00:49:08,125
What are you saying?

766
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:10,166
Your humor has no limit.

767
00:49:10,875 --> 00:49:12,333
We are used to it.

768
00:49:12,458 --> 00:49:14,375
Such conversation is quite normal
in our house.

769
00:49:14,541 --> 00:49:17,083
Neha's sense of humor has become better
because of me.

770
00:49:17,166 --> 00:49:18,916
Rahul, sorry.

771
00:49:20,083 --> 00:49:21,208
Don't be sorry.

772
00:49:41,416 --> 00:49:43,041
Hello.

773
00:49:43,125 --> 00:49:44,625
Father, meet my friends.

774
00:49:44,875 --> 00:49:45,958
-Hello.
-Hello.

775
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:49,000
-What is the matter?
-Nothing at all.

776
00:49:49,208 --> 00:49:51,375
-Why is she dressed like this?
-What do you mean?

777
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:53,166
Why is she in her night dress?

778
00:49:53,708 --> 00:49:56,000
Father, this is a fashion trend.

779
00:49:56,250 --> 00:49:57,833
Oh, is it? I had no clue.

780
00:49:57,916 --> 00:50:00,000
Well, this is a trend here.
Have some bhaji.

781
00:50:00,375 --> 00:50:02,416
Don't look at the oil. Taste it.

782
00:50:02,625 --> 00:50:03,541
Have some.

783
00:50:03,833 --> 00:50:04,750
You too.

784
00:50:06,791 --> 00:50:08,750
Maintain this taste
even in the way you dress.

785
00:50:08,958 --> 00:50:12,000
Darling, come on.
We have to rehearse for your dance.

786
00:50:13,625 --> 00:50:16,583
<span style="style.default_1">I will shred you to pieces</span>

787
00:50:16,666 --> 00:50:22,250
<span style="style.default_1">If you dare to go ahead
And attack our kingdom</span>

788
00:50:22,791 --> 00:50:27,625
<span style="style.default_1">I will shred you to pieces</span>

789
00:50:27,708 --> 00:50:31,916
<span style="style.default_1">If you dare to go ahead
And attack our kingdom</span>

790
00:50:34,041 --> 00:50:37,250
And the next student to perform is

791
00:50:37,458 --> 00:50:38,958
Megha Belwalkar!

792
00:50:51,958 --> 00:50:56,791
<span style="style.default_1">This is the same old court</span>

793
00:50:57,416 --> 00:51:02,708
<span style="style.default_1">Illuminated with chandeliers</span>

794
00:51:02,791 --> 00:51:09,250
<span style="style.default_1">Here, in the middle of the night</span>

795
00:51:09,333 --> 00:51:13,916
<span style="style.default_1">Let's get lost</span>

796
00:51:14,583 --> 00:51:17,750
<span style="style.default_1">I play with colors</span>

797
00:51:17,833 --> 00:51:23,125
<span style="style.default_1">And color my entire body</span>

798
00:51:24,041 --> 00:51:31,041
<span style="style.default_1">Putting flowers in my hair</span>

799
00:51:32,208 --> 00:51:34,416
<span style="style.default_1">Even a matured leaf</span>

800
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:40,875
<span style="style.default_1">Even a matured leaf</span>

801
00:51:40,958 --> 00:51:47,916
<span style="style.default_1">Has a tender stem</span>

802
00:51:50,916 --> 00:51:52,500
Madam, she's good.

803
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:02,375
Neha!

804
00:52:03,208 --> 00:52:04,416
I'll be right back.

805
00:52:11,250 --> 00:52:12,375
Neha.

806
00:52:14,791 --> 00:52:15,791
Neha, listen to me.

807
00:52:16,958 --> 00:52:18,083
Sit down.

808
00:52:19,041 --> 00:52:20,250
What is going on?

809
00:52:20,625 --> 00:52:22,166
Don't say a word, Makrand.

810
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:23,666
Don't overreact, Neha.

811
00:52:24,083 --> 00:52:25,041
Am I?

812
00:52:25,291 --> 00:52:26,958
Am I overreacting?

813
00:52:27,125 --> 00:52:28,750
It was so embarrassing!

814
00:52:29,625 --> 00:52:31,708
Do you think I am responsible for this?

815
00:52:31,958 --> 00:52:33,625
-I didn't say that...
-Don't touch me!

816
00:52:33,875 --> 00:52:35,958
It's okay. It is not a big deal.

817
00:52:36,125 --> 00:52:38,791
All the other parents had nothing
but disgust in their eyes.

818
00:52:39,166 --> 00:52:41,291
Forget about them, didn't you see it?

819
00:52:42,916 --> 00:52:44,583
It was so cheap and tacky.

820
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:47,500
Neha, why are you so angry?

821
00:52:48,791 --> 00:52:51,958
Passion, emotion, and anger
are the basic traits of human beings.

822
00:52:52,458 --> 00:52:54,750
An actor only displays them.

823
00:52:56,125 --> 00:52:58,791
If a decent man plays a hideous villain,

824
00:52:58,875 --> 00:53:00,500
does that make him a bad person?

825
00:53:00,958 --> 00:53:02,416
She is just a child.

826
00:53:03,125 --> 00:53:05,791
We have to think of her welfare, right?

827
00:53:06,958 --> 00:53:09,083
It was a performance by an innocent child

828
00:53:09,208 --> 00:53:10,583
and everyone enjoyed it.

829
00:53:10,666 --> 00:53:13,000
She even won an award for it.

830
00:53:13,375 --> 00:53:16,041
I am her mother
I know what is good for her.

831
00:53:16,375 --> 00:53:18,000
You think we are not good for her?

832
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:20,708
Father, I need to talk to you.

833
00:53:20,875 --> 00:53:22,125
-Okay, let's talk.
-Neha!

834
00:53:22,208 --> 00:53:23,958
Makrand, you talk to him or I'll do it.

835
00:53:24,041 --> 00:53:25,541
-Is this the time--
-No, let her speak.

836
00:53:25,791 --> 00:53:26,625
Go ahead.

837
00:53:28,916 --> 00:53:31,166
Father, should you express your opinion
in every matter?

838
00:53:31,958 --> 00:53:34,416
It's our life.
Can't we make our own decisions?

839
00:53:35,958 --> 00:53:38,416
Speaking loudly in the house,

840
00:53:38,875 --> 00:53:42,208
teaching Megha cuss words,
borrowing money,

841
00:53:44,458 --> 00:53:47,208
insulting my friends
because of their clothes.

842
00:53:47,458 --> 00:53:50,125
And the smallest fault in my cooking
is always pointed out.

843
00:53:51,333 --> 00:53:53,833
We are scared to invite anyone home.

844
00:53:54,041 --> 00:53:55,958
Who knows what will you end up saying?

845
00:53:58,291 --> 00:54:02,666
Your snide remarks are too much to handle.

846
00:54:03,958 --> 00:54:04,916
Please, Father,

847
00:54:05,708 --> 00:54:07,916
stay away from Megha.

848
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:08,875
Neha!

849
00:54:09,166 --> 00:54:10,666
What are you saying?

850
00:54:10,916 --> 00:54:12,666
Mother, I have no choice but to ask this.

851
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:17,083
Megha, you will be sleeping in my bedroom.

852
00:54:17,458 --> 00:54:18,666
Grandpa.

853
00:54:18,958 --> 00:54:20,250
She is just a child.

854
00:54:20,333 --> 00:54:22,291
That is why I am worried about her.

855
00:54:24,791 --> 00:54:25,833
Come on, Megha.

856
00:54:25,958 --> 00:54:28,541
No. Grandpa tells me stories.

857
00:54:29,791 --> 00:54:31,208
I will tell you stories.

858
00:54:31,333 --> 00:54:32,500
You don't know any.

859
00:54:32,708 --> 00:54:33,958
I'll slap you.

860
00:54:34,250 --> 00:54:35,958
Slap me. I won't sleep with you.

861
00:54:37,125 --> 00:54:38,458
What are you doing?

862
00:54:39,541 --> 00:54:41,041
That's enough!

863
00:54:44,958 --> 00:54:46,083
Go, my dear.

864
00:54:46,208 --> 00:54:47,500
Go to your mother.

865
00:54:50,541 --> 00:54:54,416
Neha, punish us, not the child.

866
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:56,083
I am wrong. Forgive me.

867
00:54:59,166 --> 00:55:00,166
Go, darling.

868
00:55:00,291 --> 00:55:02,833
Your life is beautiful.
Let it stay that way.

869
00:55:04,666 --> 00:55:05,500
Come with me.

870
00:55:09,125 --> 00:55:09,958
Father.

871
00:55:35,083 --> 00:55:37,041
<span style="style.default_1">Sound needs companionship.</span>

872
00:55:38,083 --> 00:55:39,875
<span style="style.default_1">A lamp yearns for a wick.</span>

873
00:55:41,666 --> 00:55:45,250
<span style="style.default_1">All that an old man needs
is a helping hand.</span>

877
00:55:57,291 --> 00:56:03,083
<span style="style.default_1">All this grandfather needs
is a peck on the cheeks.</span>

878
00:56:14,708 --> 00:56:17,250
-How much for the okra?
-It's two rupees per kilo.

879
00:56:17,708 --> 00:56:19,833
Should we buy some okra for tomorrow?

880
00:56:21,333 --> 00:56:22,666
Should we buy some?

881
00:56:23,666 --> 00:56:24,500
Okay.

882
00:56:30,291 --> 00:56:31,916
-What is it?
-Nothing.

883
00:56:41,625 --> 00:56:42,708
Kaveri.

884
00:56:43,666 --> 00:56:44,708
What's the matter?

885
00:56:45,166 --> 00:56:46,083
Nothing.

886
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:48,708
Are you upset?

887
00:56:50,125 --> 00:56:51,958
You haven't retired from theater yet.

888
00:56:52,125 --> 00:56:53,666
You brought it home.

889
00:56:58,750 --> 00:57:00,833
If this is about what happened yesterday,

890
00:57:00,916 --> 00:57:03,208
I have apologized to Neha.

891
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,375
I am angry because you apologized.

892
00:57:08,833 --> 00:57:11,750
You showed Neha your weakness.

893
00:57:15,583 --> 00:57:18,375
Be careful when you give away
something that belongs to you.

894
00:57:19,208 --> 00:57:21,166
But you went ahead
and gave away everything you had.

895
00:57:30,583 --> 00:57:32,166
Another thing.

896
00:57:33,458 --> 00:57:34,291
What?

897
00:57:34,458 --> 00:57:37,208
I do not like to see
you apologize to anyone.

898
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:42,791
Come on.

899
00:57:44,791 --> 00:57:46,166
Come on.

900
00:57:53,541 --> 00:57:56,250
Oh, yes, and the horse in this story?

901
00:57:56,333 --> 00:57:58,916
He was white as snow!

902
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,458
-He had a horn on his forehead.
-A horse with a horn?

903
00:58:01,541 --> 00:58:03,791
Not a horse. It was a unicorn.

904
00:58:03,875 --> 00:58:07,500
So, the prince rode the horse
to the giant's lair.

905
00:58:07,791 --> 00:58:11,583
The giant had stored his life
in the parrot.

906
00:58:12,625 --> 00:58:15,875
No matter how much he tried,
the giant would never die.

907
00:58:16,375 --> 00:58:17,541
And that's why,

908
00:58:18,250 --> 00:58:21,625
-Father.
-The prince would always lose.

909
00:58:22,708 --> 00:58:23,791
Father.

910
00:58:26,750 --> 00:58:29,083
What happened yesterday was a mistake.

911
00:58:29,750 --> 00:58:32,208
I apologize for what I said.

912
00:58:35,291 --> 00:58:36,666
And then,

913
00:58:37,416 --> 00:58:39,666
he went to the forest and...

914
00:58:42,125 --> 00:58:43,708
Come here, my son.

915
00:58:44,583 --> 00:58:47,916
She has signaled, you may come out now.

916
00:58:49,958 --> 00:58:53,375
-Father, I was wondering--
-Sit here in front of me.

917
00:58:53,875 --> 00:58:55,208
Tell me.

918
00:58:55,583 --> 00:58:57,625
Come here. You should sit here.

919
00:58:58,125 --> 00:58:59,291
Go ahead.

920
00:59:01,625 --> 00:59:03,208
It's nothing important, Father.

921
00:59:04,166 --> 00:59:07,041
I was just wondering, since the tension
in the house is growing...

922
00:59:07,833 --> 00:59:10,250
Be clear and get straight to the point.
Talk like a man.

923
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:18,541
Father, we are thinking of moving out.

924
00:59:18,916 --> 00:59:20,541
What is wrong with you, Makrand?

925
00:59:20,666 --> 00:59:23,208
You want to break up our family
over such a trivial matter?

926
00:59:24,125 --> 00:59:26,083
No, Mother but...

927
00:59:27,791 --> 00:59:30,708
Father, we didn't decide to do this
out of anger.

928
00:59:31,791 --> 00:59:35,041
But the way we argued yesterday
was quite unpleasant.

929
00:59:36,083 --> 00:59:37,958
We aren't happy about it either.

930
00:59:38,083 --> 00:59:39,166
Is that so?

931
00:59:39,666 --> 00:59:42,375
We can't deny
that there's a rift now between us.

932
00:59:42,916 --> 00:59:46,500
What is the point in living together
out of obligation?

933
00:59:47,541 --> 00:59:50,916
It's our house, our family,
there is no compulsion.

934
00:59:53,333 --> 00:59:55,083
Mother, you live your life differently.

935
00:59:55,416 --> 00:59:57,666
I'm not saying it is wrong.

936
00:59:59,833 --> 01:00:01,458
But we don't agree on certain things.

937
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:05,041
None of us should live in distress.

938
01:00:05,250 --> 01:00:07,416
Such little fights are common
in every family.

939
01:00:07,583 --> 01:00:08,458
Your Highness.

940
01:00:10,125 --> 01:00:12,083
They are not asking for our permission.

941
01:00:12,416 --> 01:00:14,041
They have already decided.

942
01:00:15,250 --> 01:00:16,375
Makrand,

943
01:00:16,583 --> 01:00:18,750
I am glad about one thing though.

944
01:00:18,833 --> 01:00:22,041
For the first time in all these years,
without hesitation,

945
01:00:22,333 --> 01:00:23,666
you have spoken your mind.

946
01:00:23,750 --> 01:00:24,625
Good!

947
01:00:26,333 --> 01:00:27,416
So, where will you live?

948
01:00:31,916 --> 01:00:35,625
We are thinking of renting a place
near my mother's house.

949
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:38,291
What about her school?

950
01:00:38,750 --> 01:00:39,791
She can take the rickshaw.

951
01:00:39,875 --> 01:00:42,000
It will be so stressful for her.

952
01:00:43,208 --> 01:00:45,041
There is no other option.

953
01:00:45,333 --> 01:00:46,750
Okay, all right.

954
01:00:56,250 --> 01:01:00,541
In that case,
we shall start packing our stuff today.

955
01:01:00,958 --> 01:01:03,291
You don't have to leave. We will move out.

956
01:01:03,666 --> 01:01:05,666
This house is not mine anymore.

957
01:01:08,208 --> 01:01:10,291
Of course, it is yours. Where will you go?

958
01:01:10,416 --> 01:01:13,000
Anywhere. It's a big world.

959
01:01:13,625 --> 01:01:17,958
Why don't you stay in our house
in the village for a few days?

960
01:01:19,291 --> 01:01:22,916
Once I get my own house,
you can come back.

961
01:01:23,166 --> 01:01:24,125
Makrand.

962
01:01:35,750 --> 01:01:36,625
It's all right.

963
01:01:37,583 --> 01:01:38,500
Go on.

964
01:01:46,791 --> 01:01:49,125
I haven't finished reading
the story, darling.

965
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:51,666
Your Highness.

966
01:01:55,375 --> 01:01:56,541
My weakness.

967
01:02:00,791 --> 01:02:05,375
<span style="style.default_1">Treat victory and defeat alike,
and engage in battle.</span>

968
01:02:06,125 --> 01:02:11,416
<span style="style.default_1">This way, you won't commit a sin.</span>

969
01:02:11,750 --> 01:02:12,583
Let's go.

970
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:17,083
Honey, give me my umbrella.

971
01:02:18,791 --> 01:02:19,708
Give it to him.

972
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:23,125
My good girl.

973
01:02:23,416 --> 01:02:25,166
-Take care.
-Yes, Mother.

974
01:02:27,791 --> 01:02:30,000
Father, let us know when you get there.

975
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:33,208
Yes, I will. I won't let you worry.

976
01:02:34,791 --> 01:02:36,083
Kaveri, get in.

977
01:02:45,291 --> 01:02:46,666
Let's go.

978
01:02:49,166 --> 01:02:50,125
-Grandpa!
-Megha!

979
01:02:50,208 --> 01:02:51,166
Megha! Stop!

980
01:02:51,291 --> 01:02:53,291
-Please stop the car.
-Grandpa, wait!

981
01:02:53,416 --> 01:02:54,708
Don't go!

982
01:02:56,166 --> 01:02:58,250
Grandpa, please stay.

983
01:02:58,541 --> 01:02:59,666
My little sparrow.

984
01:03:00,166 --> 01:03:01,708
You're a good girl, aren't you?

985
01:03:01,958 --> 01:03:03,666
-Let me go. I will come back to see you.
-No.

986
01:03:04,041 --> 01:03:04,958
I promise.

987
01:03:05,166 --> 01:03:06,416
Now listen to me.

988
01:03:06,708 --> 01:03:08,666
I will come back, I promise.

989
01:03:09,458 --> 01:03:10,916
-Go.
-Megha, come here.

990
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:14,791
-No, I won't.
-Go, little one.

991
01:03:15,916 --> 01:03:16,833
Come here.

992
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,083
Kaveri.

993
01:03:41,041 --> 01:03:42,541
You are running a fever.

994
01:03:45,291 --> 01:03:46,750
I am absolutely fine.

995
01:03:58,833 --> 01:04:00,250
<span style="style.default_1">Grandpa!</span>

996
01:04:02,166 --> 01:04:04,083
Hey, you naughty girl!

997
01:04:04,375 --> 01:04:06,708
There you are, my little angel.

998
01:04:07,708 --> 01:04:08,625
Appa!

999
01:04:11,416 --> 01:04:12,958
I am so happy.

1000
01:04:14,583 --> 01:04:17,125
<span style="style.default_1">Neha, let us play for a while.</span>

1001
01:04:17,541 --> 01:04:21,416
My dear, come here. Let's play.

1002
01:04:21,750 --> 01:04:23,000
-Appa?
-Megha!

1003
01:04:23,250 --> 01:04:24,500
What is the matter?

1004
01:04:24,791 --> 01:04:26,291
Megha, here...

1005
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:31,000
Whom are you talking to?

1006
01:04:32,416 --> 01:04:34,750
I've played so many roles onstage.

1007
01:04:36,708 --> 01:04:39,541
But the role of being a grandfather
leaves me helpless.

1008
01:04:41,250 --> 01:04:43,500
A star-studded sky during the day.

1009
01:04:45,250 --> 01:04:47,125
How can one resist the temptation?

1010
01:04:48,666 --> 01:04:49,958
My little sparrow.

1011
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,250
Don't be so furious. Calm down.

1012
01:04:56,541 --> 01:04:57,375
I won't!

1013
01:04:58,458 --> 01:05:00,750
Neha can say whatever she likes.
But what about Makrand?

1014
01:05:01,166 --> 01:05:02,916
Why didn't he talk some sense into her?

1015
01:05:03,250 --> 01:05:05,625
Why did you stay there
until the situation became this bad?

1016
01:05:05,708 --> 01:05:07,125
You should have left that night.

1017
01:05:07,208 --> 01:05:08,666
Don't make a fuss.

1018
01:05:08,750 --> 01:05:11,041
He'll let us know
once he buys his own house,

1019
01:05:11,125 --> 01:05:12,625
then we'll decide afterward.

1020
01:05:12,875 --> 01:05:15,208
You really believe
he is telling the truth?

1021
01:05:16,125 --> 01:05:18,541
I bet he won't buy his own house.

1022
01:05:18,875 --> 01:05:20,750
Neha wanted to throw you out of the house.

1023
01:05:21,458 --> 01:05:23,250
Don't jump to conclusions.

1024
01:05:24,208 --> 01:05:25,708
We lost our tempers too.

1025
01:05:26,291 --> 01:05:28,250
Once everyone calms down,
we will solve this.

1026
01:05:28,333 --> 01:05:29,916
Don't bother solving it.

1027
01:05:30,041 --> 01:05:31,875
You are going to stay with me forever.

1028
01:05:32,208 --> 01:05:34,791
Yes. This is your house.

1029
01:05:35,541 --> 01:05:37,791
-But remember one thing.
-What?

1030
01:05:38,916 --> 01:05:40,625
I won't let Neha get away so easily.

1031
01:05:42,166 --> 01:05:43,750
She is quite like me, isn't she?

1032
01:05:44,375 --> 01:05:47,375
-She is one step ahead of you!
-All the best!

1033
01:05:48,958 --> 01:05:50,250
Come, Vithoba!

1034
01:05:50,625 --> 01:05:52,333
Here's your tea.

1035
01:05:52,750 --> 01:05:54,750
Why are there five cups?

1036
01:05:54,916 --> 01:05:56,375
-The fifth one is mine.
-Yes, of course!

1037
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:57,875
Give it to him first.

1038
01:05:58,083 --> 01:05:59,458
Of course!

1039
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,541
<span style="style.default_1">We'll need a bigger lamp for this one.</span>

1040
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:04,625
Give it to me.

1041
01:06:07,125 --> 01:06:09,708
What is this?
I'll have to do it all over again.

1042
01:06:10,583 --> 01:06:11,625
What's going on, Mother?

1043
01:06:12,291 --> 01:06:13,791
-You're back?
-Yes.

1044
01:06:14,958 --> 01:06:17,125
Do you think you are young and fit?

1045
01:06:17,375 --> 01:06:18,416
Why are you working?

1046
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:20,583
You aren't well. Why don't you relax?

1047
01:06:20,791 --> 01:06:22,916
I get bored if I just sit and do nothing.

1048
01:06:23,625 --> 01:06:26,375
-I'll be in a good condition again soon.
-Right.

1049
01:06:30,708 --> 01:06:31,708
Vithoba!

1050
01:06:31,916 --> 01:06:33,166
-Coming!
-Okay.

1051
01:06:37,708 --> 01:06:38,541
Yes.

1052
01:06:39,208 --> 01:06:40,875
Sir, it's for you.

1053
01:06:41,708 --> 01:06:43,500
Now, who's calling you?

1054
01:06:44,875 --> 01:06:46,583
They're all old now.

1055
01:06:47,875 --> 01:06:49,583
"Now, who's calling you?"

1056
01:07:12,250 --> 01:07:13,208
Kaveri.

1057
01:07:15,708 --> 01:07:16,875
Kumud has passed away.

1058
01:07:22,916 --> 01:07:23,833
Mother.

1059
01:07:27,333 --> 01:07:28,250
Mother.

1060
01:07:31,458 --> 01:07:32,458
I should go.

1061
01:07:39,791 --> 01:07:41,208
Ram, enough!

1062
01:07:41,750 --> 01:07:43,750
-What are you doing?
-Give it to me.

1063
01:07:43,833 --> 01:07:44,958
Give it to me.

1064
01:07:46,041 --> 01:07:47,875
That dead body needs kerosene to burn

1065
01:07:47,958 --> 01:07:50,000
and this dead body needs this fuel.

1066
01:07:50,458 --> 01:07:52,458
-Goodbye.
-Let's go home.

1067
01:07:52,750 --> 01:07:54,125
What will I do at home?

1068
01:07:54,250 --> 01:07:55,791
There is no one waiting for me.

1069
01:07:56,208 --> 01:07:58,000
The clock keeps ticking loudly.

1070
01:07:58,458 --> 01:07:59,583
Everyone has left.

1071
01:08:02,291 --> 01:08:03,500
The skull hasn't shattered.

1072
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:07,833
Ganpat.

1073
01:08:09,375 --> 01:08:11,125
I haven't been able to do
anything for her.

1074
01:08:11,416 --> 01:08:12,583
I must do this today.

1075
01:08:13,750 --> 01:08:14,625
I'll wait.

1076
01:08:18,416 --> 01:08:19,291
For the...

1077
01:08:19,458 --> 01:08:21,000
For the past three months,

1078
01:08:21,458 --> 01:08:23,291
I've seen her dying every day.

1079
01:08:27,333 --> 01:08:29,458
The doctors asked,
"Should I take the life support from her?"

1080
01:08:30,125 --> 01:08:31,083
I refused.

1081
01:08:32,291 --> 01:08:33,416
I am selfish.

1082
01:08:34,541 --> 01:08:37,958
More than losing her,
it's being alone that terrified me.

1083
01:08:42,583 --> 01:08:44,166
I'm waiting for her.

1084
01:08:46,166 --> 01:08:47,958
Who will wait for my skull to shatter?

1085
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:50,125
Will you?

1086
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:52,250
Let's go home, you must sleep.

1087
01:08:52,375 --> 01:08:54,291
I cannot sleep.

1088
01:08:55,958 --> 01:08:57,791
I keep staring at the ceiling for hours.

1089
01:08:58,875 --> 01:09:02,375
I asked the doctor
to prescribe me some sleeping pills.

1090
01:09:02,458 --> 01:09:03,958
He said, "There's nothing wrong with you".

1091
01:09:04,041 --> 01:09:05,250
The rascal refused.

1092
01:09:05,833 --> 01:09:07,375
What's left to go wrong?

1093
01:09:27,625 --> 01:09:29,041
I have spoken to the engineer.

1094
01:09:29,125 --> 01:09:29,958
He'll come.

1095
01:09:30,041 --> 01:09:31,875
Look into it and get it done.

1096
01:09:32,041 --> 01:09:33,125
-Got it?
-Yes, sir.

1097
01:09:33,541 --> 01:09:35,208
I am going home. Tomorrow, 11 o'clock.

1098
01:09:35,291 --> 01:09:36,500
-Fine.
-Okay.

1099
01:09:37,291 --> 01:09:39,583
-Father! You are late today.
-This is Mr. Barve's bag.

1100
01:09:39,750 --> 01:09:40,916
Yes, I'm late.

1101
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,041
Let's go home.

1102
01:09:42,166 --> 01:09:43,708
No. You go ahead. I'll take a stroll.

1103
01:09:44,041 --> 01:09:45,541
Don't forget that we have a party at home.

1104
01:09:45,625 --> 01:09:47,666
Of course, this is the day
you abducted our daughter.

1105
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:49,541
It's on government records!

1106
01:09:49,958 --> 01:09:51,250
-You go ahead.
-Okay.

1107
01:09:53,875 --> 01:09:54,833
Be careful!

1108
01:10:05,125 --> 01:10:06,416
May I join you?

1109
01:10:06,541 --> 01:10:08,500
Yes, please do.

1110
01:10:09,833 --> 01:10:11,000
Here.

1111
01:10:11,208 --> 01:10:12,250
Give it to me.

1112
01:10:13,833 --> 01:10:15,250
-May I?
-Yes!

1113
01:10:15,583 --> 01:10:18,833
Hit it hard. That way.

1114
01:10:21,583 --> 01:10:22,958
Be ready!

1115
01:10:24,541 --> 01:10:26,291
Hey! There it goes.

1116
01:10:28,958 --> 01:10:31,791
These rats and their silly game!

1117
01:10:31,875 --> 01:10:34,666
What a nuisance!

1118
01:10:34,750 --> 01:10:35,875
Give it back!

1119
01:10:35,958 --> 01:10:39,625
I threw it in the fire, get lost!

1120
01:10:40,291 --> 01:10:42,083
Grandpa!

1121
01:10:42,541 --> 01:10:43,708
He won't give it back.

1122
01:10:43,791 --> 01:10:46,708
Go ahead, call some loser to help you.
I am not scared.

1123
01:10:47,666 --> 01:10:48,708
Hey.

1124
01:10:48,958 --> 01:10:51,375
Why are you harassing the children?

1125
01:10:51,458 --> 01:10:54,416
They are useless brats. Don't spoil them.

1126
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:56,000
Go away.

1127
01:10:56,166 --> 01:10:59,000
You make liquor,
and you say we are useless?

1128
01:10:59,375 --> 01:11:01,583
Your father just bought
two bottles from me.

1129
01:11:01,666 --> 01:11:03,166
Run home before he beats up your mother!

1130
01:11:03,250 --> 01:11:04,708
So, you make liquor here.

1131
01:11:04,833 --> 01:11:06,750
Of course, I do.

1132
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,958
The man in charge is a friend of mine.

1133
01:11:09,083 --> 01:11:10,416
What is his name?

1134
01:11:10,583 --> 01:11:11,958
Mr. Barve.

1135
01:11:12,208 --> 01:11:14,583
If I tell him about you, he won't let you
step on this land anymore.

1136
01:11:14,666 --> 01:11:15,916
Go home.

1137
01:11:16,083 --> 01:11:17,958
-I am sorry.
-Just go.

1138
01:11:18,083 --> 01:11:20,416
Don't tell Mr. Barve,
his father-in-law was here.

1139
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:21,833
I won't tell him. Just go.

1140
01:11:22,541 --> 01:11:23,500
-Go.
-Let's go.

1141
01:11:23,625 --> 01:11:25,083
He is Mr. Barve's worker.

1142
01:11:25,166 --> 01:11:26,750
Hey!

1143
01:11:27,375 --> 01:11:28,625
Goodness.

1144
01:11:29,583 --> 01:11:31,541
So, you're the father-in-law of my boss!

1145
01:11:32,250 --> 01:11:33,958
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

1146
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,416
What do you make here?

1147
01:11:38,125 --> 01:11:40,375
Nothing much, it's just water and...

1148
01:11:40,583 --> 01:11:42,541
Come on, tell me, what kind of liquor?

1149
01:11:45,083 --> 01:11:46,375
Blackberry wine!

1150
01:11:51,625 --> 01:11:53,666
-One last cup!
-No, enough.

1151
01:11:53,750 --> 01:11:55,833
-There isn't much left!
-Enough.

1152
01:11:56,083 --> 01:11:58,708
It is my daughter's anniversary.

1153
01:11:58,791 --> 01:12:01,708
I see. Is it very serious?

1154
01:12:02,083 --> 01:12:04,041
Take her to a good doctor.

1155
01:12:04,333 --> 01:12:07,250
Anniversary is a date celebrated
because she was married on this day.

1156
01:12:09,125 --> 01:12:10,750
I didn't know that.

1157
01:12:12,125 --> 01:12:14,125
I must leave now.
I need to go home and take a shower.

1158
01:12:14,208 --> 01:12:15,333
Here!

1159
01:12:15,583 --> 01:12:17,625
Take a dip in the dam right here.

1160
01:12:20,208 --> 01:12:21,291
Right here!

1161
01:12:23,791 --> 01:12:26,291
-But I can't swim.
-Neither can I.

1162
01:12:27,041 --> 01:12:28,166
Tell me,

1163
01:12:28,666 --> 01:12:30,958
when the fish first fell into the water,

1164
01:12:31,083 --> 01:12:33,083
did he know how to swim?

1165
01:12:35,208 --> 01:12:36,291
Stand up.

1166
01:12:36,791 --> 01:12:38,083
Stand up.

1167
01:12:44,708 --> 01:12:50,041
I will push you first, then you push me.

1168
01:12:50,333 --> 01:12:51,666
Hands up.

1169
01:12:52,416 --> 01:12:56,958
Hands up. One, two, three!

1170
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:08,500
Father!

1171
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,583
-Is everything all right?
-Just fine!

1172
01:13:12,166 --> 01:13:14,208
-Call Vithoba if you need anything.
-Yes.

1173
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:15,708
We are right here.

1174
01:13:18,958 --> 01:13:20,708
-Welcome, sir.
-Vithoba!

1175
01:13:20,791 --> 01:13:21,666
Where's your wife?

1176
01:13:22,291 --> 01:13:23,583
She is unwell.

1177
01:13:23,958 --> 01:13:25,458
-Where is Rahul?
-Over there.

1178
01:13:25,958 --> 01:13:27,291
Oh, okay.

1179
01:13:33,083 --> 01:13:34,208
Neha didn't come with you?

1180
01:13:34,583 --> 01:13:36,041
She is unwell.

1181
01:13:36,250 --> 01:13:38,583
-Which hospital is she admitted?
-Vidya!

1182
01:13:39,291 --> 01:13:41,250
We're fortunate she let even you come.

1183
01:13:41,333 --> 01:13:42,291
Vidya!

1184
01:13:43,375 --> 01:13:45,541
-How are you?
-Fine.

1185
01:13:45,958 --> 01:13:47,500
-And Megha?
-She's good.

1186
01:13:47,666 --> 01:13:48,958
Isn't she unwell?

1187
01:13:49,250 --> 01:13:50,875
-Vidya!
-I'm just asking, Rahul.

1188
01:13:51,541 --> 01:13:53,625
Come with me.
I'll introduce you to my friends.

1189
01:14:19,250 --> 01:14:20,458
-This is Nishant.
-Hello.

1190
01:14:20,541 --> 01:14:22,666
-Rahul's assistant, he has just joined.
-Madam.

1191
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:23,875
-And this is his wife...
-Hello.

1192
01:14:23,958 --> 01:14:25,791
Everyone is waiting.
Should we cut the cake?

1193
01:14:26,041 --> 01:14:26,958
Mother.

1194
01:14:36,916 --> 01:14:37,875
Oh, hello.

1195
01:14:39,208 --> 01:14:40,250
My son.

1196
01:14:42,083 --> 01:14:43,291
Shall we cut the cake?

1197
01:14:43,625 --> 01:14:45,208
Let's wait, Father will be here soon.

1198
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,833
Everyone is waiting.

1199
01:14:48,666 --> 01:14:50,375
-Let him take his own time.
-Okay.

1200
01:15:01,125 --> 01:15:03,708
Yes. I knew it.

1201
01:15:04,291 --> 01:15:07,375
You will cut the cake without me.

1202
01:15:10,291 --> 01:15:12,833
No, Father, it was because
some guests have to leave early.

1203
01:15:12,916 --> 01:15:15,833
-I am just kidding, it's okay.
-Come.

1204
01:15:16,666 --> 01:15:18,250
Hello, everyone.

1205
01:15:18,458 --> 01:15:23,208
Seven years ago,
this swindler stole our daughter.

1206
01:15:23,916 --> 01:15:26,291
He is a trickster.

1207
01:15:26,750 --> 01:15:30,541
But he is a good man,
may you live a long life!

1208
01:15:31,375 --> 01:15:33,375
My sweet child.

1209
01:15:36,041 --> 01:15:37,166
Oh, Dixit!

1210
01:15:37,250 --> 01:15:39,333
Welcome!

1211
01:15:40,541 --> 01:15:41,708
-Hello.
-Welcome.

1212
01:15:42,041 --> 01:15:44,041
Good to see you.

1213
01:15:47,416 --> 01:15:50,500
Your son who was staying in London

1214
01:15:50,583 --> 01:15:52,541
to study theater!

1215
01:15:55,041 --> 01:15:55,916
What are you drinking?

1216
01:15:57,208 --> 01:16:00,250
Oh, it's rubbish, throw it away.

1217
01:16:00,791 --> 01:16:04,875
This is the real stuff.

1218
01:16:08,250 --> 01:16:09,375
Blackberry!

1219
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:11,666
What do mean by that?

1220
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,541
Blackberry wine!

1221
01:16:13,625 --> 01:16:14,916
Blackberry wine.

1222
01:16:16,500 --> 01:16:17,500
Isn't it?

1223
01:16:18,250 --> 01:16:23,166
Everyone, throw away your drinks.
Don't drink that, you fool.

1224
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:27,208
Why do you drink this foreign whiskey?

1225
01:16:27,291 --> 01:16:29,416
Try this local brew!

1226
01:16:30,958 --> 01:16:32,458
One more?

1227
01:16:32,541 --> 01:16:36,333
That's great!

1228
01:16:36,708 --> 01:16:38,875
You are a true connoisseur!

1229
01:16:38,958 --> 01:16:41,791
We're merely captivated by fancy labels.

1230
01:16:42,291 --> 01:16:45,125
Mr. Dixit, have some.

1231
01:16:45,833 --> 01:16:48,583
I have already had enough. Really.

1232
01:16:48,708 --> 01:16:52,208
-Mother.
-Of course not. Not until I say so.

1233
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:53,750
-Come here.
-I'm coming.

1234
01:16:53,833 --> 01:16:57,333
-It's Her Highness, I must go.
-Come here. Get inside.

1235
01:16:57,416 --> 01:16:59,208
Why do you get so carried away?

1236
01:16:59,291 --> 01:17:01,166
-You drunkards are all the same.
-What are you saying?

1237
01:17:01,541 --> 01:17:02,541
Drunkards!

1238
01:17:04,666 --> 01:17:05,791
Drunkard?

1239
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:10,666
My wife says I am a drunkard.

1240
01:17:13,833 --> 01:17:15,708
Listen to this.

1241
01:17:21,458 --> 01:17:24,500
Whether to drink or not,
that is a complex question.

1242
01:17:25,166 --> 01:17:30,791
In the grind of daily life,
man discovered a miraculous potion!

1243
01:17:31,666 --> 01:17:36,541
Color, form, flavor, scent, and resonance.

1244
01:17:37,666 --> 01:17:41,416
It stimulates all the five senses.

1245
01:17:42,291 --> 01:17:47,958
The soul which lies within the body
is sent into a euphoric state.

1246
01:18:00,041 --> 01:18:00,916
Edgy.

1247
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:06,958
A drink soothes your disturbed mind.

1248
01:18:07,500 --> 01:18:08,875
Father.

1249
01:18:09,083 --> 01:18:12,666
Listen to me, our Anna...

1250
01:18:12,791 --> 01:18:15,708
He was as fond of reading
as he was of women.

1251
01:18:15,791 --> 01:18:17,333
He was an avid reader.

1252
01:18:17,416 --> 01:18:23,458
He once read somewhere
that liquor is bad for health.

1253
01:18:23,666 --> 01:18:26,083
The very next day,

1254
01:18:26,458 --> 01:18:27,916
Anna quit reading!

1255
01:18:29,375 --> 01:18:30,916
That is the beauty of alcohol!

1256
01:18:32,541 --> 01:18:36,416
Somras, Madira, Vaaruni,
Sura, Shambhavi...

1257
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:38,750
Such beautiful names it has.

1258
01:18:39,041 --> 01:18:42,625
It works its magic on you like witchcraft!

1259
01:18:44,083 --> 01:18:49,958
With every gulp,
a heavy body gets lighter and lighter.

1260
01:18:50,791 --> 01:18:55,083
It clears the fog over
your mind in an instant.

1261
01:18:55,166 --> 01:18:56,208
-Wow!
-Understood?

1262
01:18:56,500 --> 01:19:00,625
The moment it gets to you,

1263
01:19:00,958 --> 01:19:03,208
it takes over your senses.

1264
01:19:03,375 --> 01:19:07,958
Mr. Dixit, it is indeed a truth serum!

1265
01:19:10,583 --> 01:19:13,333
It hides the secrets of the devil

1266
01:19:13,708 --> 01:19:16,791
and turns many tame husbands
into brave lions.

1267
01:19:17,875 --> 01:19:20,625
Mr. Dixit, tell me the truth,
once you have had some,

1268
01:19:20,708 --> 01:19:25,333
don't you roar like a lion
in front of your wife?

1269
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:28,958
Now, listen to this.

1270
01:19:31,083 --> 01:19:33,875
A smart Alec once asked Anna,

1271
01:19:34,041 --> 01:19:36,583
"Does alcohol solve problems?"

1272
01:19:38,083 --> 01:19:41,458
Anna replied, "No, but milk
doesn't solve them either, you rascal!"

1273
01:19:43,916 --> 01:19:46,000
-Have some!
-No.

1274
01:19:46,083 --> 01:19:49,500
You must have some for me.
Or else I'll jump into the dam.

1275
01:19:49,708 --> 01:19:51,375
Go on.

1276
01:19:56,583 --> 01:19:58,125
-Let's go.
-Yes, let's go.

1277
01:20:08,708 --> 01:20:09,875
You idiot.

1278
01:20:10,458 --> 01:20:13,541
You keep refusing,
but you drank half a bottle.

1279
01:20:31,791 --> 01:20:33,458
Good morning, Your Highness.

1280
01:20:37,083 --> 01:20:38,375
Are you mad at me?

1281
01:20:41,666 --> 01:20:46,666
Should we keep talking
like Alauddin and Padmini via the mirror?

1282
01:20:46,750 --> 01:20:47,958
Please turn around.

1283
01:20:49,416 --> 01:20:51,083
Don't talk to me.

1284
01:20:52,583 --> 01:20:54,875
Rahul cares for you
more than your own son does.

1285
01:20:55,208 --> 01:20:56,541
He is an important person.

1286
01:20:56,750 --> 01:20:58,791
Are we here to make his life miserable?

1287
01:20:58,875 --> 01:21:00,458
I am sorry.

1288
01:21:01,083 --> 01:21:02,250
Sorry?

1289
01:21:03,208 --> 01:21:04,791
Go apologize to him.

1290
01:21:05,291 --> 01:21:06,750
Apologize to him?

1291
01:21:09,916 --> 01:21:11,375
Half a spoon of sugar.

1292
01:21:13,833 --> 01:21:14,875
Good morning, Father.

1293
01:21:15,125 --> 01:21:16,375
Sir, do you want some tea?

1294
01:21:16,541 --> 01:21:18,666
-Yes, please, I'll eat now.
-Come sit.

1295
01:21:19,125 --> 01:21:23,250
I am here to apologize
on Her Highness orders.

1296
01:21:23,500 --> 01:21:25,666
What? Apologize? Mother, come here.

1297
01:21:26,041 --> 01:21:27,291
I am sorry about last night.

1298
01:21:27,666 --> 01:21:29,541
The blackberry wine
went straight to my head.

1299
01:21:31,083 --> 01:21:33,333
I'm used to living freely,

1300
01:21:33,416 --> 01:21:36,375
I didn't realize
when my habits turned into vices.

1301
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:39,958
My little sparrow,

1302
01:21:41,333 --> 01:21:43,500
I got carried away last night. Sorry.

1303
01:21:45,375 --> 01:21:47,500
I ruined your party.

1304
01:21:48,166 --> 01:21:49,125
Yes, Father.

1305
01:21:49,333 --> 01:21:51,708
-You got drunk and began--
-Are you crazy?

1306
01:21:52,500 --> 01:21:53,833
Stop that.

1307
01:21:55,041 --> 01:21:56,291
Not at all, Father.

1308
01:21:56,416 --> 01:21:58,166
-No, Rahul.
-It was fun!

1309
01:21:58,416 --> 01:21:59,916
My head is pounding.

1310
01:22:00,291 --> 01:22:01,791
I can't handle alcoholic drinks anymore.

1311
01:22:01,875 --> 01:22:03,666
I shouldn't have drunk that night.

1312
01:22:03,750 --> 01:22:04,916
No, Father.

1313
01:22:07,541 --> 01:22:09,625
My boss told me.

1314
01:22:09,791 --> 01:22:10,708
What?

1315
01:22:10,791 --> 01:22:12,833
"Your father-in-law is amazing!"

1316
01:22:13,041 --> 01:22:15,000
What? Did he say that?

1317
01:22:15,458 --> 01:22:16,416
Of course.

1318
01:22:16,583 --> 01:22:17,916
Are you listening, Her Highness?

1319
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:23,500
Everyone wants a copy of your poem.

1320
01:22:24,208 --> 01:22:25,416
Which one?

1321
01:22:26,458 --> 01:22:27,958
The one that you recited last night.

1322
01:22:29,333 --> 01:22:30,583
I recited a poem last night?

1323
01:22:30,791 --> 01:22:31,625
-Yes.
-Yes.

1324
01:22:37,583 --> 01:22:40,583
In the grind of daily life,

1325
01:22:41,375 --> 01:22:43,708
man discovered...

1326
01:22:43,875 --> 01:22:45,666
A miraculous potion.

1327
01:22:46,583 --> 01:22:49,833
Yes, I must have ranted away.
I don't quite remember.

1328
01:22:50,750 --> 01:22:52,666
If Ram had been there, he would have said,

1329
01:22:52,750 --> 01:22:55,541
"Ganpat, you rascal! You are such a fake!"

1330
01:23:05,625 --> 01:23:06,541
Ram!

1331
01:23:08,083 --> 01:23:09,208
Who are you?

1332
01:23:12,125 --> 01:23:14,041
Ram, it's me, Ganpat.

1333
01:23:16,833 --> 01:23:17,916
Ganpat, who?

1334
01:23:22,041 --> 01:23:24,416
I don't know anyone by that name.

1335
01:23:25,708 --> 01:23:27,916
Hey, Ram.

1336
01:23:41,916 --> 01:23:44,250
You are not just a mediocre actor,

1337
01:23:45,083 --> 01:23:47,958
you are a despicable human being as well.

1338
01:23:51,458 --> 01:23:52,458
I...

1339
01:23:53,791 --> 01:24:00,583
I have always stood by you
through all your highs and lows.

1340
01:24:02,166 --> 01:24:05,916
But you didn't think of me even once
for the past several months?

1341
01:24:08,416 --> 01:24:09,250
You know,

1342
01:24:09,750 --> 01:24:12,791
even a disease keeps you company.

1343
01:24:13,625 --> 01:24:14,791
It walks with you.

1344
01:24:16,666 --> 01:24:17,708
But loneliness,

1345
01:24:19,416 --> 01:24:20,666
it's a painful burden.

1346
01:24:21,458 --> 01:24:22,791
It's very difficult.

1347
01:24:25,666 --> 01:24:27,125
Forgive me.

1348
01:24:28,458 --> 01:24:30,000
I was occupied

1349
01:24:31,541 --> 01:24:32,833
in my own world.

1350
01:24:33,166 --> 01:24:34,333
I am sorry.

1351
01:24:34,833 --> 01:24:35,875
Forgive me.

1352
01:24:41,208 --> 01:24:43,625
-Did it hurt?
-No. Let's go inside.

1353
01:24:46,583 --> 01:24:49,791
You must listen to me. Do as I say.

1354
01:24:50,166 --> 01:24:52,625
Don't be obstinate. Got it?

1355
01:24:53,833 --> 01:24:55,166
-Ganpat.
-Yes.

1356
01:24:56,333 --> 01:25:02,291
Had I been in your shoes,
I'd have done a lot for you too.

1357
01:25:02,666 --> 01:25:05,541
I know, Ram, you are a good man.

1358
01:25:06,666 --> 01:25:08,833
Rascal! Don't bite me.

1359
01:25:09,833 --> 01:25:11,375
-Enough.
-Okay.

1360
01:25:12,416 --> 01:25:13,583
-Okay.
-Fine.

1361
01:25:14,875 --> 01:25:16,333
Now go to sleep.

1362
01:25:17,541 --> 01:25:20,333
The beautiful Menaka will visit you
in your dreams.

1363
01:25:22,125 --> 01:25:23,458
<span style="style.default_1">Uddhava!</span>

1364
01:25:27,166 --> 01:25:31,166
Uddhava! Tell me the truth now.

1365
01:25:31,916 --> 01:25:34,208
Don't you evade my question once again.

1366
01:25:35,708 --> 01:25:37,458
A man should spend his entire life

1367
01:25:37,541 --> 01:25:41,166
solving and battling
the mysteries of life.

1368
01:25:42,125 --> 01:25:46,375
And you put an end to this journey
in the name of fate.

1369
01:25:47,750 --> 01:25:49,541
This is not justice.

1370
01:25:50,666 --> 01:25:54,375
I protest this scheme called fate.

1371
01:25:57,291 --> 01:25:59,625
You are an advocate of Karma, aren't you?

1372
01:26:01,041 --> 01:26:07,208
What did I get from you
for being loyal to my Karma?

1373
01:26:08,375 --> 01:26:10,291
I was the son of the Sun God!

1374
01:26:12,333 --> 01:26:15,041
I was the first son of Kunti,
the eldest Pandava.

1375
01:26:16,541 --> 01:26:20,166
I was the most generous person
on this earth.

1376
01:26:21,958 --> 01:26:23,333
And yet,

1377
01:26:24,291 --> 01:26:27,083
why did I face constant rejection?

1378
01:26:27,833 --> 01:26:29,000
Radheya!

1379
01:26:30,375 --> 01:26:35,500
Just like you, I'm experiencing
the hardships of life in the human form.

1380
01:26:37,500 --> 01:26:39,916
No one can escape it.

1381
01:26:41,458 --> 01:26:47,208
People like you
is a lighthouse to other men.

1382
01:26:49,791 --> 01:26:52,291
Your life is meant to burn like a lamp.

1383
01:26:52,791 --> 01:26:56,166
We find our way in your light.

1384
01:26:57,625 --> 01:27:01,416
Stop regretting
and put a rest to the bitterness.

1385
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,916
Karma, forgive everyone
with a generous heart.

1386
01:27:06,708 --> 01:27:10,000
Forgive me as well.
I haven't been fair to you.

1387
01:27:10,750 --> 01:27:14,250
You were the best warrior on this earth.

1388
01:27:15,166 --> 01:27:16,500
Madhava!

1389
01:27:17,125 --> 01:27:19,541
You have showered me with nectar.

1390
01:27:21,541 --> 01:27:24,458
What should I do with these moments?

1391
01:27:26,750 --> 01:27:30,166
The bad luck is being washed away.

1392
01:27:33,708 --> 01:27:34,833
Kaunteya,

1393
01:27:36,958 --> 01:27:38,500
will you forgive me?

1394
01:27:39,291 --> 01:27:40,708
No, Govinda.

1395
01:27:41,833 --> 01:27:43,750
Don't apologize to me.

1396
01:27:45,833 --> 01:27:49,208
I must overcome my share of hardships.

1397
01:27:50,833 --> 01:27:52,916
There is no bitterness left.

1398
01:27:55,041 --> 01:27:57,125
The creator of this world,

1399
01:27:59,208 --> 01:28:00,625
my father,

1400
01:28:02,250 --> 01:28:05,083
the Sun himself is here
to take me with him.

1401
01:28:07,208 --> 01:28:08,958
-Krishna.
-Yes?

1402
01:28:10,375 --> 01:28:11,958
I am leaving.

1403
01:28:19,833 --> 01:28:21,083
Rascal!

1404
01:28:21,625 --> 01:28:22,458
Brilliant.

1405
01:28:32,375 --> 01:28:33,458
Ram,

1406
01:28:34,625 --> 01:28:37,583
you are better than me at everything.

1407
01:28:38,541 --> 01:28:41,500
And this inferiority complex
made my life miserable.

1408
01:28:42,833 --> 01:28:46,083
And yet, I enjoyed all the success.

1409
01:28:47,625 --> 01:28:50,291
Now this realization
won't let me die in peace.

1410
01:28:55,125 --> 01:28:57,000
You are the true King of Theater.

1411
01:28:58,958 --> 01:29:00,708
Even today, you were better than me.

1412
01:29:04,541 --> 01:29:06,125
What do you want?

1413
01:29:09,625 --> 01:29:10,666
Will you give it to me?

1414
01:29:28,750 --> 01:29:29,583
<span style="style.default_1">Hello?</span>

1415
01:29:47,458 --> 01:29:48,708
Ram...

1416
01:29:50,500 --> 01:29:51,583
He has passed away?

1417
01:29:57,708 --> 01:29:59,500
He overdosed on sleeping pills?

1418
01:30:05,916 --> 01:30:06,958
Shall we leave?

1419
01:30:09,541 --> 01:30:10,708
What will we do there?

1420
01:30:13,416 --> 01:30:15,250
I have arranged for everything.

1421
01:30:17,625 --> 01:30:18,625
What do you mean?

1422
01:30:21,416 --> 01:30:23,291
I gave him the sleeping pills.

1423
01:30:27,125 --> 01:30:27,958
What?

1424
01:30:30,666 --> 01:30:32,875
Ever since Kumud died,
he was as good as dead.

1425
01:30:36,208 --> 01:30:37,666
Only his body was alive.

1426
01:30:58,625 --> 01:31:01,291
He was a very studious, deserving fellow.

1427
01:31:02,250 --> 01:31:03,958
But he didn't get what he truly deserved.

1428
01:31:04,458 --> 01:31:10,791
An actor's life is a curse.

1429
01:31:12,916 --> 01:31:14,291
An absolute curse.

1430
01:31:14,958 --> 01:31:17,458
We are endlessly insecure,

1431
01:31:18,208 --> 01:31:22,041
mirror-loving, selfish beings.

1432
01:31:24,708 --> 01:31:29,875
We can't bear to see
our dazzling popularity drop.

1433
01:31:33,208 --> 01:31:37,791
You have to be in love with yourself
every single moment.

1434
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:43,166
And that makes your skin glow.

1435
01:31:46,166 --> 01:31:48,916
Everyone is taken in by the glow.

1436
01:31:53,625 --> 01:31:55,166
Those who work in films and theater

1437
01:31:55,958 --> 01:31:59,083
live in a fake world.

1438
01:32:00,666 --> 01:32:05,458
It's very difficult
to nurture your true self.

1439
01:32:12,500 --> 01:32:15,416
There is a very heavy price to pay.

1440
01:32:20,708 --> 01:32:23,083
You've been searching the whole day,
where is it?

1441
01:32:24,083 --> 01:32:26,750
-I had kept it right here.
-Then where is it?

1442
01:32:27,250 --> 01:32:29,416
I don't know. It was right here.

1443
01:32:29,875 --> 01:32:31,416
Neither do I.

1444
01:32:35,875 --> 01:32:37,041
Issaq, give me some tea.

1445
01:32:37,208 --> 01:32:38,416
-Wonderful!
-Hello.

1446
01:32:38,750 --> 01:32:41,541
How fortunate we are
to be graced by your presence!

1447
01:32:43,041 --> 01:32:44,708
The handsome hunk!

1448
01:32:45,166 --> 01:32:46,541
The lady killer!

1449
01:32:47,083 --> 01:32:48,791
-Hey!
-You rascal!

1450
01:32:50,375 --> 01:32:52,541
I spend all my day with you.

1451
01:32:52,916 --> 01:32:54,916
When can I have the time for women?

1452
01:32:55,166 --> 01:32:56,041
Really?

1453
01:32:56,208 --> 01:32:57,666
So do these photographs lie?

1454
01:32:57,750 --> 01:33:00,000
-What photographs?
-Look at these.

1455
01:33:00,083 --> 01:33:02,208
Sheela, Zeenat. Here, take a look.

1456
01:33:02,333 --> 01:33:05,041
Issaq, enough of your nonsense.

1457
01:33:05,208 --> 01:33:06,791
You keep pestering me, idiot!

1458
01:33:06,875 --> 01:33:08,000
Why are you so furious?

1459
01:33:08,083 --> 01:33:09,708
Just mind your own business.

1460
01:33:11,708 --> 01:33:13,666
Whom are you having
an affair with this time?

1461
01:33:14,625 --> 01:33:15,583
No one.

1462
01:33:15,666 --> 01:33:17,291
Why didn't you show up at work yesterday?

1463
01:33:17,791 --> 01:33:20,666
I... But I did call him.

1464
01:33:21,208 --> 01:33:22,625
He said he'll pay up tomorrow.

1465
01:33:23,166 --> 01:33:24,833
What is this?

1466
01:33:26,625 --> 01:33:29,041
-A reminder of your romance?
-What is this?

1467
01:33:29,500 --> 01:33:31,416
It has come out of your pocket,
you should know.

1468
01:33:31,500 --> 01:33:34,666
-Where did this come from?
-No. I don't know.

1469
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:35,833
Is that so?

1470
01:33:36,916 --> 01:33:37,958
Hey!

1471
01:33:38,458 --> 01:33:39,583
Who gave this to you?

1472
01:33:39,666 --> 01:33:41,750
It must be some chick.

1473
01:33:43,500 --> 01:33:45,166
-Dilpreet!
-Coming.

1474
01:33:47,916 --> 01:33:48,791
Oman.

1475
01:33:49,750 --> 01:33:51,541
I swear I had kept it here.

1476
01:33:53,791 --> 01:33:54,916
You bitch!

1477
01:33:55,583 --> 01:33:57,125
You're back to your old habits!

1478
01:33:57,750 --> 01:34:00,291
If you don't want to change,
why waste time with me?

1479
01:34:01,250 --> 01:34:02,166
Hey!

1480
01:34:03,958 --> 01:34:07,125
I was invited to watch Othello.
What is this?

1481
01:34:16,458 --> 01:34:18,666
Please don't leave. What is the matter?

1482
01:34:20,041 --> 01:34:21,291
This stage,

1483
01:34:22,041 --> 01:34:23,416
it looks small.

1484
01:34:24,375 --> 01:34:27,250
But it has the potential
to absorb the entire world.

1485
01:34:28,583 --> 01:34:29,875
It is very profound.

1486
01:34:31,166 --> 01:34:32,625
It rejects deceit.

1487
01:34:32,958 --> 01:34:34,166
It's a mission.

1488
01:34:34,666 --> 01:34:36,375
Devote yourselves to it. Don't be dumb.

1489
01:34:36,708 --> 01:34:37,541
Father!

1490
01:34:39,708 --> 01:34:40,750
Sir, please go on.

1491
01:34:42,958 --> 01:34:45,041
You were staging a play
by Shakespeare, isn't it?

1492
01:34:45,583 --> 01:34:47,875
Do you believe it captures
the soul of Shakespeare's work?

1493
01:34:48,666 --> 01:34:49,625
Why?

1494
01:35:01,333 --> 01:35:04,375
Why don't you show us
what you have created?

1495
01:35:04,458 --> 01:35:05,833
We will watch it gladly.

1496
01:35:06,291 --> 01:35:08,291
Why use Shakespeare's work as a crutch?

1497
01:35:09,541 --> 01:35:12,125
Unfortunately, we are his disciples.

1498
01:35:13,125 --> 01:35:16,583
Many great men have spent
their entire lives interpreting him.

1499
01:35:17,750 --> 01:35:21,125
If you stage what is yours,
it will be an experiment.

1500
01:35:21,625 --> 01:35:23,916
But if you do it using his name,
it will be fraud.

1501
01:35:24,208 --> 01:35:25,041
Sorry, Ganpatrao.

1502
01:35:25,125 --> 01:35:26,791
You don't realize that times have changed.

1503
01:35:27,666 --> 01:35:28,791
-Is that so?
-Yes.

1504
01:35:29,166 --> 01:35:30,708
Art has evolved.

1505
01:35:30,916 --> 01:35:32,333
These children travel all over the world

1506
01:35:32,416 --> 01:35:34,208
and see various plays.

1507
01:35:34,500 --> 01:35:36,958
Then they use this knowledge in their work

1508
01:35:37,333 --> 01:35:38,833
and create a new form of art.

1509
01:35:41,750 --> 01:35:42,833
Mr. Dixit.

1510
01:35:44,166 --> 01:35:45,916
They should absolutely
create a form of art.

1511
01:35:46,708 --> 01:35:48,000
But let me give you an example.

1512
01:35:48,333 --> 01:35:50,208
If you want a pedigree horse,

1513
01:35:50,291 --> 01:35:52,750
you need to mate two pedigreed horses.

1514
01:35:53,416 --> 01:35:54,958
A donkey will also do.

1515
01:35:55,625 --> 01:35:57,333
But then a mule will be born.

1516
01:35:58,541 --> 01:36:01,083
It's up to you to choose
between a horse and a mule.

1517
01:36:04,208 --> 01:36:05,958
A complete waste of time.

1518
01:36:06,166 --> 01:36:08,958
They think they can revive Shakespeare.

1519
01:36:57,333 --> 01:36:59,166
Vidya, calm down.

1520
01:36:59,625 --> 01:37:01,291
He didn't do it on purpose.

1521
01:37:02,041 --> 01:37:03,500
He didn't realize what he did wrong.

1522
01:37:03,791 --> 01:37:05,625
How could he not realize?

1523
01:37:06,833 --> 01:37:08,541
How can you be so irresponsible?

1524
01:37:13,958 --> 01:37:15,916
We often have
important people visiting us.

1525
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:17,250
But you make a mess in the house,

1526
01:37:17,333 --> 01:37:18,666
bring home dirty roadside snacks,

1527
01:37:18,750 --> 01:37:20,875
and even insult our guests!

1528
01:37:23,458 --> 01:37:25,958
Remember how you embarrassed us
at our own party?

1529
01:37:30,333 --> 01:37:32,708
Yes, people do respect
your age and experience

1530
01:37:32,791 --> 01:37:34,166
But there is a limit to it.

1531
01:37:38,166 --> 01:37:41,208
To top it all off,
you insulted Mr. Dixit yesterday!

1532
01:37:42,166 --> 01:37:43,625
What about Rahul's job?

1533
01:37:46,916 --> 01:37:48,375
I am sorry.

1534
01:37:49,541 --> 01:37:51,041
But this was about theater.

1535
01:37:51,333 --> 01:37:54,000
And I spoke
because they wanted my opinion.

1536
01:37:54,291 --> 01:37:56,666
That doesn't mean you could insult them.

1537
01:37:57,250 --> 01:37:58,416
Vidya, enough!

1538
01:38:01,291 --> 01:38:03,000
My little sparrow, let me speak.

1539
01:38:04,083 --> 01:38:06,625
I agree there is etiquette
which needs to be followed.

1540
01:38:06,708 --> 01:38:08,000
You are right.

1541
01:38:08,250 --> 01:38:09,916
But you don't have to worry anymore.

1542
01:38:10,166 --> 01:38:12,333
Just let us go away.

1543
01:38:12,666 --> 01:38:15,416
Father, you are not going to leave.

1544
01:38:15,875 --> 01:38:16,833
Vidya.

1545
01:38:17,500 --> 01:38:19,916
You often have special guests
visiting you.

1546
01:38:20,583 --> 01:38:22,583
We don't want to inconvenience you.

1547
01:38:23,291 --> 01:38:26,166
We have stayed with you for a long time.
It's time for us to go.

1548
01:38:26,583 --> 01:38:29,208
Mother, I won't let you leave.

1549
01:38:30,250 --> 01:38:31,083
Got it?

1550
01:38:33,333 --> 01:38:34,750
-Father.
-Yes?

1551
01:38:35,458 --> 01:38:36,791
May I suggest something?

1552
01:38:37,041 --> 01:38:38,333
Yes, of course.

1553
01:38:40,416 --> 01:38:43,208
This is happening
because we are constantly together.

1554
01:38:43,583 --> 01:38:45,625
Neither of us are getting our privacy.

1555
01:38:45,958 --> 01:38:46,916
So?

1556
01:38:49,083 --> 01:38:51,500
Would you mind moving to the outhouse?

1557
01:38:57,541 --> 01:38:58,500
Father.

1558
01:39:03,583 --> 01:39:06,333
Sure, that will be great.

1559
01:39:06,583 --> 01:39:07,500
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

1560
01:39:07,625 --> 01:39:10,625
That way, I can look after you
and still have our privacy.

1561
01:39:10,875 --> 01:39:12,750
Great. Come on, Your Highness.

1562
01:39:12,916 --> 01:39:13,750
Come.

1563
01:39:13,958 --> 01:39:15,708
You will be very comfortable,

1564
01:39:15,791 --> 01:39:17,166
the place is cozy and plush.

1565
01:39:22,333 --> 01:39:24,458
Come on, Your Highness.

1566
01:39:49,208 --> 01:39:50,375
Are you upset?

1567
01:39:52,541 --> 01:39:53,375
Yes.

1568
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:56,666
I do not approve of
treating them like this

1569
01:39:56,750 --> 01:39:58,666
just because they are dependent on us.

1570
01:39:59,041 --> 01:40:00,541
Rahul, they are my parents,

1571
01:40:00,666 --> 01:40:02,541
and I know how to deal with them.

1572
01:40:03,083 --> 01:40:04,708
But Rishabh knows what father meant.

1573
01:40:06,208 --> 01:40:07,583
He is not offended at all.

1574
01:40:09,375 --> 01:40:11,166
As for Mr. Dixit, he can differentiate

1575
01:40:11,291 --> 01:40:13,291
between personal and work life.

1576
01:40:15,041 --> 01:40:16,625
And if he is upset, I will deal with him.

1577
01:40:18,500 --> 01:40:20,083
Why should you put up with it?

1578
01:40:20,916 --> 01:40:22,375
Rahul, you are a good man.

1579
01:40:22,500 --> 01:40:24,750
But I don't want anyone
to take advantage of you,

1580
01:40:24,833 --> 01:40:26,166
not even my parents.

1581
01:40:26,791 --> 01:40:28,083
This is your life.

1582
01:40:28,875 --> 01:40:31,833
I will not let my parents disrupt it.

1583
01:40:33,416 --> 01:40:35,958
Remember, old age is another childhood.

1584
01:40:42,083 --> 01:40:44,333
But where will I find someone
who will take care of them?

1585
01:41:04,958 --> 01:41:06,791
It has a nice high ceiling.

1586
01:41:09,375 --> 01:41:10,208
Great.

1587
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:12,916
That's a lovely patio.

1588
01:41:20,375 --> 01:41:25,125
Kaveri, our little sparrow is so creative.

1589
01:41:28,250 --> 01:41:29,125
Nice.

1590
01:41:30,125 --> 01:41:31,208
This is quite good.

1591
01:41:31,791 --> 01:41:34,541
I thought an outhouse
would be a shabby place.

1592
01:41:34,625 --> 01:41:36,291
But this is bright and airy!

1593
01:41:37,291 --> 01:41:39,166
We should have come here much earlier.

1594
01:41:39,500 --> 01:41:41,125
And now we can have our own privacy.

1595
01:41:42,291 --> 01:41:43,333
Isn't it?

1596
01:41:44,875 --> 01:41:47,083
Why do you give anybody a chance
to insult you?

1597
01:41:48,833 --> 01:41:52,166
I do what I believe is right.

1598
01:41:53,166 --> 01:41:54,833
I can't change that.

1599
01:41:55,875 --> 01:41:57,166
Don't take it so lightly.

1600
01:41:57,750 --> 01:42:00,416
We have been cast aside
like old unwanted stuff.

1601
01:42:01,166 --> 01:42:03,166
I was wrong too, wasn't I?

1602
01:42:03,916 --> 01:42:05,666
They have their own life.

1603
01:42:06,125 --> 01:42:08,208
-Let us leave this place.
-Where?

1604
01:42:08,875 --> 01:42:09,958
Morwadi.

1605
01:42:11,625 --> 01:42:14,208
We have our own
small piece of land and a house.

1606
01:42:15,208 --> 01:42:16,250
Are you crazy?

1607
01:42:16,833 --> 01:42:18,666
Doctors in that town aren't good enough.

1608
01:42:18,750 --> 01:42:20,000
Even the specialists in the city

1609
01:42:20,083 --> 01:42:23,000
haven't even been able to
diagnose your ailment.

1610
01:42:23,583 --> 01:42:24,875
It doesn't matter.

1611
01:42:25,250 --> 01:42:29,416
I don't want to live like a hindrance
to our children.

1612
01:42:30,125 --> 01:42:31,333
I feel suffocated.

1613
01:42:31,541 --> 01:42:34,375
You must bear with it.
You are running a fever.

1614
01:42:37,791 --> 01:42:38,916
Your Highness.

1615
01:42:39,583 --> 01:42:41,583
Your Highness, sit down here.

1616
01:42:42,041 --> 01:42:42,916
Come here.

1617
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:45,625
I shall set up everything
the way you want it.

1618
01:42:45,708 --> 01:42:47,250
Sit down.

1619
01:42:47,666 --> 01:42:48,750
Good.

1620
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:54,333
I did not help you
when you first set up our house.

1621
01:42:54,875 --> 01:43:00,500
Now I will set this place up
just the way you want it.

1622
01:43:01,750 --> 01:43:04,875
You just keep smiling.

1623
01:43:05,500 --> 01:43:07,583
It will help us start afresh.

1624
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:08,916
-Shall we?
-Yes.

1625
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:10,625
-Then listen to me.
-Okay

1626
01:43:10,791 --> 01:43:13,041
We have saved 12,000 rupees.

1627
01:43:13,416 --> 01:43:15,500
I have the necklace as well.

1628
01:43:16,083 --> 01:43:19,125
Let us sell it, and we shall have enough.

1629
01:43:19,750 --> 01:43:21,333
Why do you insist?

1630
01:43:22,166 --> 01:43:23,625
I'm not comfortable here.

1631
01:43:25,916 --> 01:43:26,750
Okay.

1632
01:43:27,666 --> 01:43:31,583
I will go to Pune next week
and meet some of my jeweler friends.

1633
01:43:32,333 --> 01:43:34,000
I will take care of it.

1634
01:43:34,125 --> 01:43:35,583
Come on.

1635
01:43:36,833 --> 01:43:40,750
-Just tell me what to do.
-Please don't do anything.

1636
01:43:40,958 --> 01:43:42,833
I'll have to do everything all over again.

1637
01:43:42,916 --> 01:43:44,791
All right, as you wish.

1638
01:43:45,041 --> 01:43:47,833
<span style="style.default_1">-Vithoba, did you get everything?
-Yes, madam.</span>

1639
01:43:48,375 --> 01:43:49,791
-Turmeric?
-Yes.

1640
01:43:49,875 --> 01:43:52,166
Mustard. 38 rupees for rice!

1641
01:43:52,791 --> 01:43:54,250
The prices have gone up.

1642
01:43:54,458 --> 01:43:56,333
Oh, what is this?

1643
01:43:56,666 --> 01:43:57,958
Postman.

1644
01:43:58,250 --> 01:43:59,291
Oh, it's the oil brand.

1645
01:43:59,458 --> 01:44:02,875
-Madam, here is the balance.
-Where are Mother's medicines?

1646
01:44:03,083 --> 01:44:05,291
The pharmacist will deliver it
in the evening.

1647
01:44:05,458 --> 01:44:08,125
Then keep the money
and make sure you get it in the evening.

1648
01:44:08,208 --> 01:44:10,666
-You're still checking the grocery list?
-You're late today.

1649
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,416
There were many people at the bank.
Keep this money safe.

1650
01:44:14,333 --> 01:44:15,750
Why did you withdraw so much?

1651
01:44:16,208 --> 01:44:18,125
I am going to Nasik tomorrow.

1652
01:44:18,250 --> 01:44:20,125
I'll need it.
That's why I made a withdrawal.

1653
01:44:20,250 --> 01:44:21,458
Am I not going with you?

1654
01:44:21,625 --> 01:44:23,125
We had decided to go to Shirdi!

1655
01:44:23,791 --> 01:44:26,250
-Of course, come with me then.
-All right.

1656
01:44:27,666 --> 01:44:29,583
I'll shower,
then let's have breakfast together.

1657
01:44:29,750 --> 01:44:30,583
Okay.

1658
01:44:31,083 --> 01:44:33,750
-Are you sure you got everything?
-Yes.

1659
01:44:35,375 --> 01:44:36,500
Where is the towel?

1660
01:44:37,666 --> 01:44:39,041
Why can't he get it himself?

1661
01:44:39,166 --> 01:44:40,750
You prepare the tea, I'll be right back.

1662
01:44:41,041 --> 01:44:42,541
-Okay.
-Coming.

1663
01:44:49,250 --> 01:44:52,416
Vithoba, are you done with the newspaper?

1664
01:44:52,708 --> 01:44:54,083
-Yes.
-Give them to me.

1665
01:44:54,166 --> 01:44:56,375
Please take it, I'm preparing the tea.

1666
01:45:08,625 --> 01:45:11,583
<span style="style.default_1">Kaveri, how could you forget Dabholkar?</span>

1667
01:45:12,125 --> 01:45:14,875
Dabholkar? A man or a woman?

1668
01:45:15,375 --> 01:45:17,583
He was the producer of my play.

1669
01:45:18,583 --> 01:45:19,791
Which one?

1670
01:45:20,375 --> 01:45:22,833
The one that shut down after ten shows.

1671
01:45:23,666 --> 01:45:25,000
Which one?

1672
01:45:26,166 --> 01:45:27,666
Oh, the one I couldn't attend?

1673
01:45:28,208 --> 01:45:31,458
Because your sister was unwell.

1674
01:45:31,541 --> 01:45:33,166
-Is that the one?
-Yes.

1675
01:45:33,250 --> 01:45:34,541
Oh, I see.

1676
01:45:35,250 --> 01:45:38,166
I didn't get to see you perform
in that play.

1677
01:45:38,500 --> 01:45:40,916
I was really good.

1678
01:45:42,333 --> 01:45:46,250
Dabholkar and you had a spat
over the actress,

1679
01:45:46,833 --> 01:45:48,625
that is all I know.

1680
01:45:49,416 --> 01:45:51,333
God knows the rest.

1681
01:45:52,791 --> 01:45:54,666
A good play had to be shut down,

1682
01:45:54,750 --> 01:45:56,791
and you couldn't see it, that's all.

1683
01:45:57,250 --> 01:45:59,458
The rest of the details don't matter.

1684
01:46:00,125 --> 01:46:02,083
When did I ever ask for details?

1685
01:46:03,125 --> 01:46:04,666
But since you raised the topic,

1686
01:46:05,708 --> 01:46:07,500
-why don't you tell me?
-What?

1687
01:46:07,666 --> 01:46:09,125
How many were there?

1688
01:46:12,333 --> 01:46:13,625
Who were they?

1689
01:46:14,875 --> 01:46:16,666
Your Highness, why dig up the past?

1690
01:46:17,500 --> 01:46:20,125
You always insist on
not suppressing your true feelings!

1691
01:46:20,958 --> 01:46:25,583
Why remind a ruined fort
of its past battles?

1692
01:46:26,416 --> 01:46:28,125
You don't need to hide it anymore.

1693
01:46:28,208 --> 01:46:29,916
I am not!

1694
01:46:30,833 --> 01:46:33,708
You were a little fond of Menka, right?

1695
01:46:34,750 --> 01:46:35,708
Your Highness.

1696
01:46:36,166 --> 01:46:40,166
You and the audience were
a little too curious about Menka.

1697
01:46:40,708 --> 01:46:44,041
She used to sing well,
but what about her jaw?

1698
01:46:44,208 --> 01:46:45,541
Wasn't it a bit too large?

1699
01:46:46,875 --> 01:46:49,291
To clean her teeth,
toothpick had to go through her ear.

1700
01:46:51,416 --> 01:46:54,250
What about the others?

1701
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:00,500
This dazzling world has lured millions
into temptation.

1702
01:47:02,666 --> 01:47:06,708
How can those who live in that world
and not be affected?

1703
01:47:08,166 --> 01:47:11,083
Someone or the other touches your heart.

1704
01:47:12,291 --> 01:47:15,500
Someone's beauty, someone's talent,

1705
01:47:16,833 --> 01:47:19,333
it warms up your heart.

1706
01:47:23,333 --> 01:47:24,416
Your Highness.

1707
01:47:26,375 --> 01:47:29,250
Some aroused unusual thoughts,

1708
01:47:30,958 --> 01:47:33,250
and some gave profound understanding.

1709
01:47:34,958 --> 01:47:36,708
The body always asks for more,

1710
01:47:36,791 --> 01:47:39,041
it would be foolish to reflect on it.

1711
01:47:40,500 --> 01:47:42,000
You don't achieve anything.

1712
01:47:43,708 --> 01:47:47,083
At the end, with the scars of defeat
and flags of victories,

1713
01:47:48,041 --> 01:47:50,166
the battleship always returns to the port.

1714
01:47:51,416 --> 01:47:53,375
I did falter, I must confess.

1715
01:47:54,041 --> 01:47:55,791
What more do I need to confess?

1716
01:47:57,333 --> 01:47:59,500
Your love was stronger.

1717
01:48:00,208 --> 01:48:01,333
It triumphed.

1718
01:48:02,166 --> 01:48:03,625
Not at all.

1719
01:48:04,666 --> 01:48:06,125
I was never charming.

1720
01:48:06,416 --> 01:48:08,416
You underestimate yourself!

1721
01:48:10,958 --> 01:48:12,125
You betray yourself.

1722
01:48:13,708 --> 01:48:15,000
You are beautiful!

1723
01:48:16,750 --> 01:48:19,458
I swear to everyone and you.

1724
01:48:20,666 --> 01:48:22,375
You are simply exquisite!

1725
01:48:32,541 --> 01:48:33,625
A love bird!

1726
01:48:34,333 --> 01:48:36,208
Have you seen one?

1727
01:48:45,041 --> 01:48:48,000
Always in full bloom
because it is full of love.

1728
01:48:49,083 --> 01:48:50,791
Love makes everyone beautiful.

1729
01:48:51,666 --> 01:48:53,333
And you're beautiful as it is.

1730
01:48:54,083 --> 01:48:56,416
Just keep smiling, keep singing.

1731
01:48:57,083 --> 01:48:59,458
Not superficially, but from deep within,

1732
01:48:59,708 --> 01:49:01,375
from your heart, from your soul.

1733
01:49:03,708 --> 01:49:06,083
You are simply lovely!

1734
01:49:07,125 --> 01:49:08,500
What was that?

1735
01:49:08,791 --> 01:49:10,791
The play you had missed.

1736
01:49:11,125 --> 01:49:13,125
-Oh, dear!
-Why?

1737
01:49:13,916 --> 01:49:15,666
I thought those were true feelings.

1738
01:49:20,375 --> 01:49:22,041
That was sarcastic!

1739
01:49:29,291 --> 01:49:31,166
Good morning. What are you doing?

1740
01:49:31,416 --> 01:49:33,291
Vithoba got me to do this.

1741
01:49:34,583 --> 01:49:35,916
Why did you deliver our breakfast?

1742
01:49:36,791 --> 01:49:38,000
Where is he?

1743
01:49:38,416 --> 01:49:39,375
He is around.

1744
01:49:39,541 --> 01:49:42,500
But I wanted to see you.
It's been a while.

1745
01:49:43,791 --> 01:49:45,833
-Here, Father.
-What a pleasant surprise.

1746
01:49:47,250 --> 01:49:49,750
Father, I am going to Nasik
for a couple of days,

1747
01:49:49,916 --> 01:49:51,166
so I wanted to see you.

1748
01:49:51,416 --> 01:49:53,166
Who will take care of us?

1749
01:49:53,416 --> 01:49:55,791
Vithoba is here.

1750
01:49:57,458 --> 01:49:58,333
Mother.

1751
01:49:58,833 --> 01:50:00,375
Keep that aside and eat something.

1752
01:50:01,750 --> 01:50:02,916
Eat it while it's hot.

1753
01:50:04,375 --> 01:50:06,541
Nice, there's saffron in this!

1754
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:08,166
How is your fever?

1755
01:50:08,708 --> 01:50:09,541
Better.

1756
01:50:13,750 --> 01:50:14,958
-Father.
-Yes?

1757
01:50:15,041 --> 01:50:18,541
When you came to get the newspaper
yesterday, was anyone else around?

1758
01:50:19,291 --> 01:50:20,500
No, it was just me.

1759
01:50:25,875 --> 01:50:27,375
Is something missing?

1760
01:50:28,458 --> 01:50:31,833
Did I leave my knitting needles here?

1761
01:50:32,708 --> 01:50:34,750
I haven't seen them for a couple of days.

1762
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:40,333
How would your needles end up here?

1763
01:50:43,041 --> 01:50:44,083
What about these?

1764
01:50:45,166 --> 01:50:46,125
They are mine.

1765
01:50:46,416 --> 01:50:47,583
Do you want them?

1766
01:50:49,333 --> 01:50:51,833
No. In the cupboard?

1767
01:50:52,166 --> 01:50:53,958
Why would they be in the cupboard?

1768
01:50:56,125 --> 01:50:59,541
What if they were kept inside
along with the clothes?

1769
01:50:59,875 --> 01:51:01,458
Then check for yourself.

1770
01:51:03,958 --> 01:51:06,041
-They aren't here.
-Buy new ones.

1771
01:51:06,958 --> 01:51:08,666
Rahul got them from Singapore.

1772
01:51:09,166 --> 01:51:11,916
I wanted to finish knitting your scarf
before I leave for Nasik.

1773
01:51:12,125 --> 01:51:13,041
Okay.

1774
01:51:16,958 --> 01:51:18,916
Why is your suitcase here? What's inside?

1775
01:51:19,500 --> 01:51:21,375
Nothing but our old stuff.

1776
01:51:21,916 --> 01:51:23,208
Could the needles be in there?

1777
01:51:23,416 --> 01:51:25,041
How could they be there?

1778
01:51:25,458 --> 01:51:28,458
Perhaps they are with the woolen clothes
that I sent last week.

1779
01:51:28,541 --> 01:51:29,958
Check it out.

1780
01:51:37,500 --> 01:51:39,208
Has Rahul left for office?

1781
01:51:40,583 --> 01:51:41,541
What is it?

1782
01:51:42,041 --> 01:51:43,208
What's the matter?

1783
01:51:46,375 --> 01:51:47,458
The needles aren't in there.

1784
01:51:48,125 --> 01:51:50,583
I told you they couldn't be there.

1785
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:51,833
Vidya.

1786
01:51:52,208 --> 01:51:53,208
Hey, Vidya!

1787
01:51:53,916 --> 01:51:54,833
Vidya!

1788
01:51:56,708 --> 01:52:00,208
Why is she so obsessed with the needles?

1789
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,750
A woman's obsessions are inexplicable.

1790
01:52:04,625 --> 01:52:05,583
Finish eating.

1791
01:52:26,750 --> 01:52:27,583
Vidya.

1792
01:52:28,291 --> 01:52:29,541
What is the matter?

1793
01:52:30,458 --> 01:52:31,333
Nothing.

1794
01:52:31,916 --> 01:52:32,958
Nothing?

1795
01:52:35,375 --> 01:52:36,375
Why are you crying?

1796
01:52:41,583 --> 01:52:43,250
The money is in Father's suitcase.

1797
01:52:45,416 --> 01:52:46,375
What?

1798
01:52:48,375 --> 01:52:51,500
If he had asked, would we have refused?

1799
01:52:52,708 --> 01:52:54,458
How could he steal
from his own daughter's house?

1800
01:52:56,166 --> 01:52:58,166
Let's not jump to conclusions, okay?

1801
01:53:02,666 --> 01:53:03,541
Don't be silly.

1802
01:53:04,458 --> 01:53:05,500
They are my parents.

1803
01:53:05,583 --> 01:53:06,458
Vidya.

1804
01:53:08,250 --> 01:53:13,500
<span style="style.default_1">During the festival of Holi</span>

1805
01:53:13,750 --> 01:53:15,500
<span style="style.default_1">My beloved will be here</span>

1806
01:53:16,375 --> 01:53:19,208
<span style="style.default_1">To apply colors to me</span>

1807
01:53:19,375 --> 01:53:21,500
Where have you been since morning?

1808
01:53:25,458 --> 01:53:26,708
What's the matter?

1809
01:53:27,583 --> 01:53:29,916
Punish me if I am wrong,
but don't accuse me.

1810
01:53:30,375 --> 01:53:32,083
What have I said to you?

1811
01:53:32,708 --> 01:53:33,708
Never mind.

1812
01:53:33,875 --> 01:53:36,583
-What is going on?
-Mr. Barve's money has been stolen.

1813
01:53:37,041 --> 01:53:39,541
They have been interrogating me
since morning.

1814
01:53:39,875 --> 01:53:40,916
When did this happen?

1815
01:53:41,125 --> 01:53:42,625
Since yesterday.

1816
01:53:43,125 --> 01:53:44,833
I know that they lost something important.

1817
01:53:45,291 --> 01:53:47,125
But what about my feelings?

1818
01:53:47,916 --> 01:53:49,833
We had no idea.

1819
01:53:50,041 --> 01:53:51,458
Now they say they were mistaken.

1820
01:53:51,958 --> 01:53:53,250
But they already humiliated me.

1821
01:53:53,833 --> 01:53:56,708
I can't comprehend
what goes through their minds.

1822
01:53:57,291 --> 01:53:58,500
I am going to quit.

1823
01:53:59,458 --> 01:54:00,708
Hey, Vithoba.

1824
01:54:00,958 --> 01:54:02,500
Now, look for another Vithoba.

1825
01:54:09,500 --> 01:54:10,458
Kaveri...

1826
01:54:12,041 --> 01:54:13,791
Vithoba wouldn't do such a thing.

1827
01:54:14,500 --> 01:54:16,500
How could Rahul accuse him?

1828
01:54:18,541 --> 01:54:21,500
She wasn't looking for the needles.

1829
01:54:33,541 --> 01:54:34,583
Vidya!

1830
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:38,083
Vidya!

1831
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:40,666
Father! Come in.

1832
01:54:40,958 --> 01:54:43,500
-No, call her out.
-Just come inside.

1833
01:54:43,583 --> 01:54:44,916
No, I won't. Vidya!

1834
01:54:45,041 --> 01:54:45,875
Hey, Vidya!

1835
01:54:46,583 --> 01:54:48,791
I am here. Don't shout.

1836
01:54:49,291 --> 01:54:50,208
What is it?

1837
01:54:50,291 --> 01:54:52,583
Do you suspect me of stealing your money?

1838
01:54:53,208 --> 01:54:55,250
You think your father is a thief?

1839
01:54:55,583 --> 01:54:58,041
-Father, it's a misunderstanding--
-Stay out of this.

1840
01:54:59,750 --> 01:55:01,958
Father, if you needed money
why didn't you ask me?

1841
01:55:02,333 --> 01:55:04,750
Would I have refused? Why did you steal?

1842
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,500
You mean you think I stole your money?

1843
01:55:07,708 --> 01:55:10,083
I have seen the money in your suitcase.

1844
01:55:10,250 --> 01:55:13,583
-Foolish girl, that money--
-You are not going to say a word!

1845
01:55:14,583 --> 01:55:15,875
Not a word?

1846
01:55:17,166 --> 01:55:19,041
When you're surrounded by people

1847
01:55:19,125 --> 01:55:23,750
who cruelly make accusations
without consideration of others,

1848
01:55:23,833 --> 01:55:25,125
how can I not speak up?

1849
01:55:25,958 --> 01:55:29,708
She knows my wrath is worthless,

1850
01:55:30,208 --> 01:55:34,958
like a dying pig at the side of the road.

1851
01:55:35,333 --> 01:55:36,500
I stole their money?

1852
01:55:37,500 --> 01:55:39,166
I stole their money?

1853
01:55:39,708 --> 01:55:42,750
-I know you haven't done it.
-I stole their money?

1854
01:55:43,166 --> 01:55:46,125
-But don't be angry.
-Anger is pointless.

1855
01:55:46,333 --> 01:55:47,833
And I am not going to cry either.

1856
01:55:47,916 --> 01:55:52,250
If my eyes well up with tears,
I'll hammer nails into them.

1857
01:55:52,333 --> 01:55:54,083
But I won't cry
in front of these wretched people.

1858
01:55:54,541 --> 01:55:56,416
Shameless girl, I stole your money?

1859
01:55:56,500 --> 01:55:57,750
Yes, you did!

1860
01:55:58,458 --> 01:56:01,083
-You stole the money.
-Vidya, enough!

1861
01:56:04,208 --> 01:56:05,041
Hey.

1862
01:56:05,916 --> 01:56:07,208
Are you all right?

1863
01:56:09,666 --> 01:56:12,041
Vidya, call the police.

1864
01:56:12,791 --> 01:56:13,958
That's the right thing to do.

1865
01:56:14,833 --> 01:56:16,916
-What a grateful daughter you are!
-Mother, listen...

1866
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:19,041
-Mother--
-Enough!

1867
01:56:19,166 --> 01:56:21,416
You call the police
and put us behind bars.

1868
01:56:21,541 --> 01:56:22,375
Let's go.

1869
01:56:22,916 --> 01:56:24,333
Are you all right?

1870
01:56:25,916 --> 01:56:27,458
Don't worry, we won't run away.

1871
01:56:28,041 --> 01:56:28,958
Let's go.

1872
01:56:29,541 --> 01:56:33,041
I told you, I feel suffocated here.

1873
01:56:33,583 --> 01:56:38,458
This King of Theater who has spent
thousands without a second thought

1874
01:56:39,250 --> 01:56:41,458
has been called a thief by his own child.

1875
01:56:42,416 --> 01:56:43,458
Never mind.

1876
01:56:44,166 --> 01:56:46,083
We shall leave behind
these unpleasant memories.

1877
01:56:47,416 --> 01:56:49,458
-But calm down.
-Yes.

1878
01:56:50,916 --> 01:56:53,708
I can't let anything bad happen to you.

1879
01:56:54,458 --> 01:56:56,833
When I am with you,
I am not worried at all.

1880
01:56:57,958 --> 01:57:00,416
I will live like
I never bore any children,

1881
01:57:01,625 --> 01:57:02,750
but don't be mad.

1882
01:57:02,916 --> 01:57:05,458
-No, I will not be mad.
-Do as I say.

1883
01:57:05,875 --> 01:57:08,541
-Yes, that is all I will do.
-Promise me.

1884
01:57:08,708 --> 01:57:09,583
Yes.

1885
01:57:13,208 --> 01:57:14,916
Why did he have to do this?

1886
01:57:17,833 --> 01:57:19,666
Did you have to overreact?

1887
01:57:22,166 --> 01:57:24,708
We could have handled this
in a much better way.

1888
01:57:26,375 --> 01:57:27,291
Also,

1889
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:29,666
is money so important?

1890
01:57:39,791 --> 01:57:42,750
A soul hovering in space.

1891
01:57:44,500 --> 01:57:47,666
It comes to the earth
through the path of our lust,

1892
01:57:47,750 --> 01:57:50,625
and we think
we've become fathers and mothers!

1893
01:57:54,583 --> 01:57:56,000
It's all false.

1894
01:57:57,250 --> 01:57:58,416
False.

1895
01:58:00,333 --> 01:58:02,041
We are mere bridges.

1896
01:58:02,958 --> 01:58:04,083
To connect.

1897
01:58:06,791 --> 01:58:10,291
Ask the elephants who bear
the load of expectations,

1898
01:58:11,333 --> 01:58:12,458
they will tell you.

1899
01:58:14,125 --> 01:58:16,000
We all walk alone.

1900
01:58:28,291 --> 01:58:29,250
Come on.

1901
01:58:30,291 --> 01:58:31,291
I am leaving.

1902
01:58:34,083 --> 01:58:35,375
Do you want to come with me?

1903
01:58:35,625 --> 01:58:36,708
I'll wait for you.

1904
01:58:38,041 --> 01:58:40,333
I really don't feel like going.
You can go.

1905
01:58:41,666 --> 01:58:42,666
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

1906
01:58:45,250 --> 01:58:46,208
Take care.

1907
01:58:47,750 --> 01:58:49,208
Take care of Mother and Father too.

1908
01:58:57,666 --> 01:58:58,666
Go.

1909
01:59:08,958 --> 01:59:09,791
Rahul!

1910
01:59:12,333 --> 01:59:13,250
What is it?

1911
01:59:22,041 --> 01:59:23,875
I forgot about this.

1912
01:59:24,625 --> 01:59:25,625
Come, let's go.

1913
01:59:26,250 --> 01:59:27,583
-Your Highness.
-Yes?

1914
01:59:28,541 --> 01:59:30,333
You left your idol.

1915
01:59:39,833 --> 01:59:41,083
Father!

1916
01:59:43,125 --> 01:59:43,958
Father.

1917
01:59:44,041 --> 01:59:45,625
What is it now?

1918
01:59:46,625 --> 01:59:48,083
Please don't say that.

1919
01:59:50,916 --> 01:59:51,833
What happened?

1920
01:59:52,083 --> 01:59:54,416
I've made a huge mistake,
please forgive me.

1921
01:59:55,375 --> 01:59:56,416
What happened?

1922
01:59:56,583 --> 01:59:57,458
I...

1923
01:59:58,916 --> 02:00:01,166
I kept the money safe somewhere,

1924
02:00:01,750 --> 02:00:03,458
-and I forgot about it.
-All right.

1925
02:00:03,541 --> 02:00:05,958
-So, you found your money.
-Yes.

1926
02:00:07,083 --> 02:00:09,875
So, we are free from the blame.

1927
02:00:11,708 --> 02:00:14,708
Thank you, Almighty.

1928
02:00:17,083 --> 02:00:19,500
Mother, please talk to Father.

1929
02:00:19,750 --> 02:00:21,125
Please tell him...

1930
02:00:21,958 --> 02:00:23,041
Shut up.

1931
02:00:23,875 --> 02:00:25,500
Don't you dare speak to me.

1932
02:00:27,708 --> 02:00:30,375
Mother, please don't say that.

1933
02:00:30,916 --> 02:00:32,708
I am sorry.

1934
02:00:34,500 --> 02:00:38,500
He gave everything he had
to both of you, his children, didn't he?

1935
02:00:39,958 --> 02:00:41,666
I told him so many times

1936
02:00:41,958 --> 02:00:44,500
to save something for our old age.

1937
02:00:45,541 --> 02:00:46,500
But he didn't!

1938
02:00:47,250 --> 02:00:49,333
He trusted his children blindly.

1939
02:00:49,708 --> 02:00:51,375
"My children are gems."

1940
02:00:51,916 --> 02:00:53,291
"There is no need to worry."

1941
02:00:53,750 --> 02:00:56,333
These are your gems!

1942
02:01:00,625 --> 02:01:01,750
Mother, you are right.

1943
02:01:02,625 --> 02:01:03,833
We made a mistake.

1944
02:01:05,708 --> 02:01:08,458
The money that she saw in our suitcase,

1945
02:01:08,625 --> 02:01:10,458
do you even know where it came from?

1946
02:01:12,083 --> 02:01:17,041
He sold the necklace
that he gave me as a present.

1947
02:01:17,166 --> 02:01:20,416
That's where the money came from.

1948
02:01:24,125 --> 02:01:25,666
Please calm down.

1949
02:01:25,916 --> 02:01:27,708
How dare she accuse him?

1950
02:01:28,291 --> 02:01:29,333
Kaveri.

1951
02:01:30,583 --> 02:01:33,083
She must have thought, "What can they do?

1952
02:01:34,958 --> 02:01:37,458
Even if I humiliate them
with such disgusting accusations,

1953
02:01:37,541 --> 02:01:39,500
how can they retaliate?

1954
02:01:41,583 --> 02:01:43,416
They are dependent on us."

1955
02:01:43,916 --> 02:01:45,041
No, Father.

1956
02:01:47,083 --> 02:01:49,750
This man,
one of the most respected actors,

1957
02:01:50,333 --> 02:01:54,250
who always lived lavishly

1958
02:01:55,458 --> 02:02:00,125
and was lauded by the stalwarts.

1959
02:02:00,500 --> 02:02:02,333
Today, this King of Theater

1960
02:02:03,375 --> 02:02:06,291
lies like a helpless dog
at their doorstep.

1961
02:02:06,541 --> 02:02:07,541
Father!

1962
02:02:08,625 --> 02:02:11,875
Call him a thief or a bandit,
what difference does it make?

1963
02:02:14,041 --> 02:02:16,083
His only fault

1964
02:02:17,625 --> 02:02:19,125
is he trusted blindly.

1965
02:02:19,833 --> 02:02:22,583
No, Father! Your little sparrow
has made a huge mistake.

1966
02:02:22,833 --> 02:02:25,250
No, not anymore.

1967
02:02:25,333 --> 02:02:28,000
My little sparrow is gone. She is dead.

1968
02:02:29,208 --> 02:02:31,791
And now I am alone.

1969
02:02:32,708 --> 02:02:35,458
Your Highness, it's just you and me now.

1970
02:02:36,083 --> 02:02:38,375
We only have each other. Let's go.

1971
02:02:38,958 --> 02:02:41,208
-Get ready.
-No!

1972
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:42,833
No.

1973
02:02:43,916 --> 02:02:45,916
I won't let you leave.

1974
02:02:46,250 --> 02:02:47,791
You are too late, my dear.

1975
02:02:48,583 --> 02:02:50,375
You have lost the right to say that.

1976
02:02:50,500 --> 02:02:51,625
Let's go, Kaveri.

1977
02:02:52,625 --> 02:02:54,458
Where will you go?

1978
02:02:54,666 --> 02:02:57,333
We are going away from here.
As for the place, I don't know.

1979
02:02:57,666 --> 02:02:58,500
No!

1980
02:02:59,333 --> 02:03:01,000
Nobody is leaving!

1981
02:03:01,416 --> 02:03:03,333
Mother! Nobody...

1982
02:03:03,625 --> 02:03:05,750
Nobody is leaving!

1983
02:03:05,833 --> 02:03:07,791
Vithoba, just tell them.

1984
02:03:08,125 --> 02:03:10,458
Tell them! Nobody is leaving!

1985
02:03:10,833 --> 02:03:12,416
Nobody is going anywhere.

1986
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:14,250
Nobody!

1987
02:03:35,125 --> 02:03:37,333
Listen, get up.

1988
02:03:38,208 --> 02:03:39,791
Everyone must be sleeping.

1989
02:03:39,958 --> 02:03:41,166
Come, let's go.

1990
02:03:41,666 --> 02:03:44,291
Your Highness,
you're running a high fever.

1991
02:03:44,375 --> 02:03:47,125
-No, I am fine. Let's leave.
-Are you sure?

1992
02:03:47,791 --> 02:03:51,041
-Let's go.
-You don't listen to me.

1993
02:04:09,375 --> 02:04:10,791
This is locked from outside.

1994
02:04:11,750 --> 02:04:13,208
Try that door.

1995
02:04:19,833 --> 02:04:21,291
This one is locked too.

1996
02:04:22,041 --> 02:04:23,125
Now what?

1997
02:04:27,583 --> 02:04:28,708
Come.

1998
02:04:31,083 --> 02:04:33,375
The great escape!

1999
02:04:34,666 --> 02:04:40,375
<span style="style.default_1">Don't give our relationship</span>

2000
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:46,375
<span style="style.default_1">A title or a definition</span>

2001
02:04:46,750 --> 02:04:52,333
<span style="style.default_1">Don't give our relationship</span>

2002
02:04:53,083 --> 02:04:58,375
<span style="style.default_1">A title or a definition</span>

2003
02:04:58,791 --> 02:05:04,541
<span style="style.default_1">The world is oblivious</span>

2004
02:05:04,708 --> 02:05:10,708
<span style="style.default_1">To a lot of stars in the sky</span>

2005
02:05:10,833 --> 02:05:16,375
<span style="style.default_1">Don't give our relationship</span>

2006
02:05:16,875 --> 02:05:21,875
<span style="style.default_1">A title or a definition</span>

2007
02:05:22,375 --> 02:05:28,125
<span style="style.default_1">The world is oblivious</span>

2008
02:05:28,791 --> 02:05:34,583
<span style="style.default_1">To a lot of stars in the sky</span>

2009
02:05:34,666 --> 02:05:36,041
<span style="style.default_1">Don't give our relationship...</span>

2010
02:05:36,125 --> 02:05:37,708
Stop!

2011
02:05:38,375 --> 02:05:40,833
Go back.

2012
02:05:40,958 --> 02:05:43,000
Where are you going on such a rainy night?

2013
02:05:43,125 --> 02:05:45,416
Can you take us to Morwadi?

2014
02:05:45,708 --> 02:05:46,875
Where is that?

2015
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:48,833
Just after Koregaon.

2016
02:05:49,333 --> 02:05:50,791
I'll drop you at Gulbarg Junction.

2017
02:05:51,416 --> 02:05:53,250
You'll get a bus to Morwadi from there.

2018
02:05:53,875 --> 02:05:55,458
Okay, that will do.

2019
02:05:56,083 --> 02:05:57,541
Get in, then.

2020
02:06:00,458 --> 02:06:01,791
Be careful!

2021
02:06:03,375 --> 02:06:07,250
Great! We've got a whole truck
to ourselves!

2022
02:06:07,458 --> 02:06:08,333
Sit down.

2023
02:06:08,750 --> 02:06:10,625
<span style="style.default_1">-You know what...
-What?</span>

2024
02:06:11,208 --> 02:06:14,250
<span style="style.default_1">I am feeling much better today.</span>

2025
02:06:15,166 --> 02:06:17,500
But don't say it aloud.

2026
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,708
The devil can hear everything.

2027
02:06:22,625 --> 02:06:23,791
-Tell me.
-What?

2028
02:06:23,875 --> 02:06:27,125
What should we do once we reach Morwadi?

2029
02:06:28,416 --> 02:06:31,291
We'll call someone to clean the house.

2030
02:06:31,458 --> 02:06:33,000
Make it new and shiny!

2031
02:06:34,125 --> 02:06:37,125
Until it is ready, we'll build
a little fireplace in the backyard.

2032
02:06:38,458 --> 02:06:42,291
The food will be delicious
when you cook on it.

2033
02:06:43,041 --> 02:06:43,875
No.

2034
02:06:45,208 --> 02:06:48,541
First, we'll pay a visit
to the Moreshwar temple.

2035
02:06:48,791 --> 02:06:49,666
Okay.

2036
02:06:50,833 --> 02:06:53,833
Before going to the temple,
I'll take a dip in the river.

2037
02:06:55,291 --> 02:06:57,875
All that is evil shall be washed away.

2038
02:06:59,541 --> 02:07:00,958
Yes, it will.

2039
02:07:02,583 --> 02:07:04,250
<span style="style.default_1">The river will purify us.</span>

2040
02:07:04,791 --> 02:07:06,666
You still have a fever.

2041
02:07:07,750 --> 02:07:09,500
I am absolutely fine.

2042
02:07:10,625 --> 02:07:12,708
Once we get to Morwadi,

2043
02:07:13,875 --> 02:07:16,833
I will paint the walls with my own hands.

2044
02:07:18,166 --> 02:07:20,541
Once I put my mind into it,

2045
02:07:21,208 --> 02:07:23,750
I can transform the hut into a palace.

2046
02:07:26,625 --> 02:07:28,833
You must not interfere

2047
02:07:30,333 --> 02:07:32,208
or lecture me.

2048
02:07:33,125 --> 02:07:34,666
I am warning you.

2049
02:07:36,708 --> 02:07:39,041
<span style="style.default_1">Just hope I don't forget
your warning by then.</span>

2050
02:07:39,833 --> 02:07:41,750
I have a wish since a long time ago.

2051
02:07:41,833 --> 02:07:42,750
What?

2052
02:07:42,958 --> 02:07:45,958
I want to plant the holy basil
in the backyard.

2053
02:07:46,958 --> 02:07:48,291
All right.

2054
02:07:53,166 --> 02:07:54,083
Your Highness.

2055
02:07:55,291 --> 02:07:58,625
In the last 50 years,
there's one thing I forgot to tell you.

2056
02:07:59,125 --> 02:08:01,250
Oh, dear! Now what?

2057
02:08:03,583 --> 02:08:05,000
You make me very happy.

2058
02:08:07,416 --> 02:08:08,875
I love you very much.

2059
02:08:12,583 --> 02:08:14,250
Don't I know that already?

2060
02:08:15,125 --> 02:08:17,125
You don't have to tell me.

2061
02:08:18,291 --> 02:08:20,166
But I wanted to say it aloud.

2062
02:08:25,958 --> 02:08:28,375
<span style="style.default_1">Sir, this is your stop.</span>

2063
02:08:28,750 --> 02:08:30,750
<span style="style.default_1">You can take a bus to Morwadi from here.</span>

2064
02:08:31,041 --> 02:08:32,000
Okay.

2065
02:08:32,916 --> 02:08:34,208
Come on, Your Highness.

2066
02:08:34,625 --> 02:08:37,750
Get up. Be careful.

2067
02:08:39,291 --> 02:08:41,083
Get up, we are here.

2068
02:08:42,375 --> 02:08:48,000
<span style="style.default_1">He is not bound</span>

2069
02:08:48,541 --> 02:08:53,791
<span style="style.default_1">By the rules of rhythm and notes</span>

2070
02:08:54,083 --> 02:09:00,000
<span style="style.default_1">He is not bound</span>

2071
02:09:00,416 --> 02:09:02,708
<span style="style.default_1">By the rules of rhythm and notes</span>

2072
02:09:02,791 --> 02:09:05,666
Don't bother him. Let him sleep.

2073
02:09:05,958 --> 02:09:08,458
Put off the lamps, don't waste oil.

2074
02:09:08,625 --> 02:09:10,625
Please come with me.

2075
02:09:12,833 --> 02:09:17,833
<span style="style.default_1">A cloud of music</span>

2076
02:09:18,250 --> 02:09:24,541
<span style="style.default_1">A cloud of music</span>

2077
02:09:24,625 --> 02:09:27,541
<span style="style.default_1">Will be showered all around us</span>

2078
02:09:27,625 --> 02:09:30,250
Thank god, my knees are intact.

2079
02:09:30,333 --> 02:09:35,166
<span style="style.default_1">The world is oblivious</span>

2080
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:44,000
<span style="style.default_1">To a lot of stars in the sky</span>

2081
02:09:44,833 --> 02:09:46,333
Here, take this blanket.

2082
02:09:51,291 --> 02:09:52,916
Cozy up now.

2083
02:09:57,916 --> 02:09:58,916
Go to sleep.

2084
02:10:08,333 --> 02:10:10,458
Here's my crown.

2085
02:10:18,708 --> 02:10:20,083
Kaveri.

2086
02:10:20,958 --> 02:10:22,583
Has your fever gone up?

2087
02:10:23,416 --> 02:10:25,666
No, it's just the rain.

2088
02:10:28,458 --> 02:10:30,791
Once we get to Morwadi,
everything will be fine.

2089
02:10:38,083 --> 02:10:38,916
Please sing for me.

2090
02:10:41,291 --> 02:10:43,750
You won't be able to sleep.

2091
02:10:44,041 --> 02:10:46,083
Don't worry about me. Just sing.

2092
02:11:49,416 --> 02:11:50,458
Kaveri.

2093
02:11:52,375 --> 02:11:53,875
Wake up, it's morning.

2094
02:11:56,791 --> 02:11:59,500
I slept peacefully after such a long time.

2095
02:12:00,166 --> 02:12:01,833
Come on, get up.

2096
02:12:03,291 --> 02:12:04,208
Good.

2097
02:12:05,083 --> 02:12:06,500
Your fever is gone.

2098
02:12:07,041 --> 02:12:07,958
Get up.

2099
02:12:08,708 --> 02:12:12,791
Actually, no, sleep for a while.
I'll get us some tea.

2100
02:12:25,583 --> 02:12:26,833
-Hello.
-Hello.

2101
02:12:26,916 --> 02:12:28,583
Two cups of tea, please.

2102
02:12:29,833 --> 02:12:31,541
You have come
to visit the temple so early!

2103
02:12:32,250 --> 02:12:34,083
No, we came last night and stayed here.

2104
02:12:34,166 --> 02:12:35,750
We are going to Morwadi.

2105
02:12:36,041 --> 02:12:37,125
-Morwadi?
-Yes.

2106
02:12:37,250 --> 02:12:38,625
The bus will be here in half an hour.

2107
02:12:38,875 --> 02:12:41,750
We must get ready.
I should wake up Her Highness now.

2108
02:12:43,666 --> 02:12:44,541
Her Highness?

2109
02:12:45,250 --> 02:12:47,791
Yes, my wife. I call her that.

2110
02:12:47,875 --> 02:12:51,458
Oh, I see. She seems to be in deep sleep.

2111
02:12:51,750 --> 02:12:53,458
I left the money over there, I'll get it.

2112
02:12:53,541 --> 02:12:54,916
Sure.

2113
02:13:05,791 --> 02:13:07,208
Are you up already?

2114
02:13:08,750 --> 02:13:09,875
Good.

2115
02:13:10,541 --> 02:13:12,333
But she is still asleep.

2116
02:13:12,750 --> 02:13:14,291
Come on, get up.

2117
02:13:16,041 --> 02:13:17,083
Your Highness!

2118
02:13:18,375 --> 02:13:19,750
Get up, have some tea.

2119
02:13:20,416 --> 02:13:21,916
Open your eyes.

2120
02:13:23,541 --> 02:13:25,666
Our bus will be here soon.

2121
02:13:26,250 --> 02:13:27,250
Get up.

2122
02:13:28,291 --> 02:13:29,166
Your Highness.

2123
02:13:32,708 --> 02:13:33,708
Your Highness.

2124
02:13:48,083 --> 02:13:50,416
Your Highness, don't scare me.

2125
02:13:52,250 --> 02:13:54,000
Haven't we planned everything already?

2126
02:13:56,375 --> 02:13:59,666
I will be your serve you all the time.

2127
02:14:02,208 --> 02:14:03,875
Come on. Get up, let's get ready.

2128
02:14:04,833 --> 02:14:05,708
Your Highness.

2129
02:14:07,416 --> 02:14:09,791
The whole world can betray me,

2130
02:14:10,583 --> 02:14:12,291
but you can't.

2131
02:14:12,750 --> 02:14:14,750
Ram was a rascal, so he's gone.

2132
02:14:15,666 --> 02:14:17,958
Your Highness, get up.
Please don't scare me.

2133
02:14:18,375 --> 02:14:19,291
Get up.

2134
02:14:19,375 --> 02:14:22,333
Our house, the holy basil,
they are waiting for us.

2135
02:14:23,041 --> 02:14:23,958
Come on.

2136
02:14:24,250 --> 02:14:26,083
Come on, wake up!

2137
02:14:26,500 --> 02:14:29,750
I will not put up with your stubbornness.

2138
02:14:30,416 --> 02:14:31,375
Get up!

2139
02:14:31,791 --> 02:14:32,625
Come on, get up!

2140
02:14:32,750 --> 02:14:33,708
-Sir...
-Yes.

2141
02:14:33,916 --> 02:14:35,291
She has passed away.

2142
02:14:37,250 --> 02:14:38,416
Impossible.

2143
02:14:39,916 --> 02:14:45,125
<span style="style.default_1">The dim street lamps</span>

2144
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:52,000
<span style="style.default_1">Cannot guide a person in the night</span>

2145
02:14:52,083 --> 02:14:57,708
<span style="style.default_1">The dim street lamps</span>

2146
02:14:58,291 --> 02:15:03,500
<span style="style.default_1">Cannot guide a person in the night</span>

2147
02:15:03,916 --> 02:15:09,625
<span style="style.default_1">A person whose destination lies</span>

2148
02:15:09,833 --> 02:15:15,875
<span style="style.default_1">In the star-studded sky</span>

2149
02:15:15,958 --> 02:15:21,375
<span style="style.default_1">Don't give our relationship...</span>

2150
02:15:21,541 --> 02:15:22,583
Sir.

2151
02:15:24,083 --> 02:15:24,916
Here.

2152
02:15:26,375 --> 02:15:27,208
It's yours.

2153
02:15:28,458 --> 02:15:30,125
I stole it from your bag last night.

2154
02:15:30,833 --> 02:15:32,000
I spent some of it.

2155
02:15:39,958 --> 02:15:43,125
What's wrong? Take it.
Or else I'll spend it all on alcohol.

2156
02:15:54,541 --> 02:15:56,916
-Sir!
<span style="style.default_1">-You are young.</span>

2157
02:15:57,083 --> 02:16:01,791
<span style="style.default_1">All you can do is lust after women.</span>

2158
02:16:03,250 --> 02:16:06,333
<span style="style.default_1">But the crows and vultures are also young.</span>

2159
02:16:06,416 --> 02:16:09,583
<span style="style.default_1">The pigs and donkeys
by the road are young too.</span>

2160
02:16:10,666 --> 02:16:15,041
<span style="style.default_1">The lowly bugs in hell also procreate
with the female bugs,</span>

2161
02:16:15,125 --> 02:16:19,125
<span style="style.default_1">and add to their population growth
and die like bugs.</span>

2162
02:16:20,458 --> 02:16:25,291
<span style="style.default_1">One man rose above the swamp
of bodily pleasures,</span>

2163
02:16:25,666 --> 02:16:27,625
<span style="style.default_1">my father and yours.</span>

2164
02:16:28,708 --> 02:16:32,416
<span style="style.default_1">You may forget your own,
but if you forget this father,</span>

2165
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:37,625
<span style="style.default_1">the vultures waiting in the hills
will consume you within a moment.</span>

2166
02:16:37,708 --> 02:16:40,833
<span style="style.default_1">Not just you, but all of mankind.</span>

2167
02:16:41,625 --> 02:16:42,875
We're doing the best we can.

2168
02:16:42,958 --> 02:16:44,541
We'll let you know the moment we find out.

2169
02:16:45,083 --> 02:16:47,333
But when? It's been three months!

2170
02:16:47,791 --> 02:16:49,250
What have you done in three months?

2171
02:16:49,458 --> 02:16:50,916
Don't teach us how to do our job.

2172
02:16:51,916 --> 02:16:55,083
If you had been responsible,
you wouldn't be in this situation.

2173
02:16:55,833 --> 02:16:57,375
-You may leave.
-What?

2174
02:16:58,625 --> 02:17:00,250
Let's go.

2175
02:17:02,416 --> 02:17:04,083
Where have you been, Appa?

2176
02:17:05,541 --> 02:17:07,833
I woke up in the morning
to see you were gone.

2177
02:17:08,416 --> 02:17:10,458
Where were you? At the restaurant?

2178
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:12,708
That is only in the evening.

2179
02:17:12,791 --> 02:17:14,250
Then where were you?

2180
02:17:14,583 --> 02:17:15,833
I have other things to do.

2181
02:17:15,958 --> 02:17:17,333
Yes, of course!

2182
02:17:17,875 --> 02:17:19,458
You are the chief minister of the state!

2183
02:17:20,041 --> 02:17:21,500
You must have so much to do!

2184
02:17:22,083 --> 02:17:24,000
Where is your car with the beacon?

2185
02:17:25,458 --> 02:17:26,583
Apply some cream.

2186
02:17:27,125 --> 02:17:28,708
-Here, do it yourself.
-Okay, never mind.

2187
02:17:28,791 --> 02:17:30,000
More cream!

2188
02:17:32,375 --> 02:17:35,083
Appar, take this and eat something.

2189
02:17:35,791 --> 02:17:36,958
Go ahead, I'll join you.

2190
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:45,916
Look at this, yellow cream.

2191
02:17:47,041 --> 02:17:50,375
<span style="style.default_1">I'm here, my love, I'm back
With my heart on my sleeve...</span>

2192
02:17:50,458 --> 02:17:51,333
<span style="style.default_1">THAT IS NOT ME</span>

2193
02:17:51,416 --> 02:17:52,375
<span style="style.default_1">TOUR, TOUR</span>

2194
02:18:12,208 --> 02:18:13,041
<span style="style.default_1">THE FORT OF RAIGAD</span>

2195
02:18:13,125 --> 02:18:13,958
<span style="style.default_1">CHARLEY'S AUNT</span>

2196
02:18:14,833 --> 02:18:16,791
Do you want to go see a play tonight?

2197
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:23,833
No, it's very expensive.

2198
02:18:24,083 --> 02:18:27,125
Don't worry about money,
I have a lot of it.

2199
02:18:32,916 --> 02:18:34,583
Have you ever seen a play?

2200
02:18:42,583 --> 02:18:43,500
No.

2201
02:18:44,416 --> 02:18:46,041
It's a bad habit.

2202
02:19:09,708 --> 02:19:10,541
Appa!

2203
02:19:11,958 --> 02:19:12,916
Is he here?

2204
02:19:13,083 --> 02:19:14,708
-Who?
-Appa!

2205
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:17,000
-Appa.
-Kashinath, what does he want?

2206
02:19:17,208 --> 02:19:18,833
Appa!

2207
02:19:19,041 --> 02:19:21,125
-Sir...
-Let me go!

2208
02:19:21,333 --> 02:19:23,250
-Appa is here.
-What is it?

2209
02:19:23,541 --> 02:19:24,916
Appa.

2210
02:19:25,291 --> 02:19:26,916
-The police...
-Where?

2211
02:19:27,208 --> 02:19:29,750
-They are taking everyone away.
-Where is the police?

2212
02:19:29,833 --> 02:19:31,208
Why do you drink so much?

2213
02:19:45,458 --> 02:19:46,916
Stop!

2214
02:19:49,875 --> 02:19:50,916
Raja!

2215
02:19:52,708 --> 02:19:54,875
Hey! Don't hit him!

2216
02:19:56,500 --> 02:19:57,833
Hey, Raja!

2217
02:19:59,166 --> 02:20:01,375
Raja! Let him go!

2218
02:20:01,791 --> 02:20:03,500
Raja!

2219
02:20:03,833 --> 02:20:05,458
-Appa, don't worry.
-Wait.

2220
02:20:05,666 --> 02:20:07,000
Go to the food stall.

2221
02:20:07,083 --> 02:20:09,416
Get yourself something to eat.
I'll pay for it later.

2222
02:20:10,875 --> 02:20:13,125
Raja!

2223
02:20:16,666 --> 02:20:18,041
What is going on?

2224
02:20:36,041 --> 02:20:38,208
Can you give me a shelter?

2225
02:20:38,625 --> 02:20:40,041
No, you can't.

2226
02:20:45,625 --> 02:20:48,291
Can someone provide me shelter?

2227
02:20:50,166 --> 02:20:52,500
A storm is in need of shelter.

2228
02:20:54,291 --> 02:20:57,333
Without a roof, walls,

2229
02:20:57,500 --> 02:21:00,416
love, or God's kindness,

2230
02:21:00,708 --> 02:21:02,791
a storm brews in the mountains,

2231
02:21:03,625 --> 02:21:07,250
looking for a place
to settle down forever.

2232
02:21:08,375 --> 02:21:10,875
Can someone provide shelter?

2233
02:21:13,416 --> 02:21:14,875
What do you want?

2234
02:21:15,166 --> 02:21:16,625
Honestly,

2235
02:21:18,083 --> 02:21:20,500
the storm is exhausted.

2236
02:21:22,375 --> 02:21:24,958
It has lost its strength
after roaring in the forest,

2237
02:21:25,041 --> 02:21:26,916
the mountains, and the valleys.

2238
02:21:28,875 --> 02:21:31,541
After riding the waves of the ocean

2239
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:36,125
and singing in the flames
of the forest fire,

2240
02:21:37,416 --> 02:21:39,416
the storm is exhausted.

2241
02:21:40,875 --> 02:21:45,250
It is dragging its half-burned wings
behind it.

2242
02:21:46,708 --> 02:21:48,250
Honestly,

2243
02:21:50,291 --> 02:21:53,375
the storm has become its own nemesis.

2244
02:21:55,791 --> 02:21:56,833
Hey.

2245
02:21:59,166 --> 02:22:01,166
Hey, anybody...

2246
02:22:01,708 --> 02:22:03,916
Can anybody give me shelter?

2247
02:22:04,708 --> 02:22:05,833
A home?

2248
02:22:07,458 --> 02:22:11,500
The storm doesn't need a mansion
nor the set of a palace,

2249
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:15,791
neither laurels nor garlands,
nor costly gifts.

2250
02:22:16,375 --> 02:22:19,708
Just a tiny house to rest in.

2251
02:22:20,666 --> 02:22:23,791
An armchair for the storm to sit in.

2252
02:22:24,208 --> 02:22:25,500
And

2253
02:22:26,458 --> 02:22:29,375
a holy basil plant in the backyard.

2254
02:22:29,833 --> 02:22:31,458
For Her Highness.

2255
02:22:42,250 --> 02:22:43,791
Her Highness!

2256
02:22:48,791 --> 02:22:51,333
How can I live now, Your Highness?

2257
02:22:56,041 --> 02:22:58,958
Can someone please give me shelter?

2258
02:23:04,416 --> 02:23:06,000
Mother, give me my bottle.

2259
02:23:06,166 --> 02:23:08,708
Makrand, please walk her to the bus stop.

2260
02:23:11,166 --> 02:23:12,375
-Makrand!
-Yes?

2261
02:23:13,166 --> 02:23:14,458
Could you walk her to the bus stop?

2262
02:23:15,416 --> 02:23:16,666
Isn't your mother going today?

2263
02:23:17,250 --> 02:23:18,750
I am not feeling well.

2264
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:20,458
Otherwise, I'd have gone with her.

2265
02:23:21,583 --> 02:23:22,708
Okay. I'll go.

2266
02:23:24,291 --> 02:23:25,500
Are you all right?

2267
02:23:26,750 --> 02:23:27,708
I am fine.

2268
02:23:28,041 --> 02:23:30,041
You've been unusually quiet since morning.

2269
02:23:31,291 --> 02:23:32,833
It is Father's birthday today.

2270
02:23:33,666 --> 02:23:35,375
Mother, where is Grandpa?

2271
02:23:50,125 --> 02:23:51,250
Raja.

2272
02:23:52,625 --> 02:23:53,541
Hey, dear.

2273
02:23:54,166 --> 02:23:55,791
Hey, Raja! When did you get back?

2274
02:23:57,375 --> 02:23:58,708
-Are you all right?
-Hey!

2275
02:23:58,875 --> 02:24:00,375
-Yes.
-When did you get back?

2276
02:24:00,958 --> 02:24:03,791
-They let us go in the morning.
-Did they beat you up?

2277
02:24:04,125 --> 02:24:05,708
No, not at all.

2278
02:24:05,916 --> 02:24:07,125
All they need is a little bribe.

2279
02:24:07,916 --> 02:24:08,958
Forget about that.

2280
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:12,875
What is this?

2281
02:24:15,083 --> 02:24:17,166
The theater manager had 30 shoes
to be shined.

2282
02:24:17,875 --> 02:24:20,333
I asked for two tickets
instead of the money.

2283
02:24:21,125 --> 02:24:22,041
But...

2284
02:24:23,208 --> 02:24:25,791
-But, why did you...
-Please don't say no.

2285
02:24:46,208 --> 02:24:50,291
<span style="style.default_1">From darkness</span>

2286
02:24:50,875 --> 02:24:56,041
<span style="style.default_1">Toward glory</span>

2287
02:24:56,791 --> 02:25:02,166
<span style="style.default_1">Take us, oh, Lord of Light, to burn</span>

2288
02:25:02,250 --> 02:25:09,166
<span style="style.default_1">To the temple of Lord Shiva
Like the holy flame...</span>

2289
02:25:14,916 --> 02:25:17,958
To live or to die
that is the only question.

2290
02:25:20,541 --> 02:25:21,583
Sharmishtha!

2291
02:25:22,166 --> 02:25:23,791
Do you remember what she said?

2292
02:25:24,583 --> 02:25:26,416
He is a drunkard.

2293
02:25:26,583 --> 02:25:29,125
He surrounds himself with women
who are impure,

2294
02:25:29,250 --> 02:25:30,916
deranged, and good-for-nothing!

2295
02:25:32,500 --> 02:25:35,500
My revenge will shake the earth!

2296
02:25:35,958 --> 02:25:40,625
<span style="style.default_1">You might think that this
old helpless man will cry. But I won't.</span>

2297
02:25:47,416 --> 02:25:53,791
<span style="style.default_1">Oh, musical notes, be like the moon</span>

2298
02:25:53,916 --> 02:25:57,750
<span style="style.default_1">And shine your light on me...</span>

2299
02:25:57,833 --> 02:25:58,750
Appa.

2300
02:25:59,875 --> 02:26:04,208
<span style="style.default_1">And let it reach my love as well...</span>

2301
02:26:04,291 --> 02:26:10,250
I am not brave enough to venture
into a new and unknown territory.

2302
02:26:10,875 --> 02:26:12,500
<span style="style.default_1">That's why...</span>

2303
02:26:27,708 --> 02:26:29,500
Appa, let's get something to eat.

2304
02:26:43,708 --> 02:26:46,958
To live or to die,
that is the only question.

2305
02:26:49,416 --> 02:26:54,458
Is it wise to live a useless,
shameless, and helpless existence,

2306
02:26:54,541 --> 02:26:57,708
in this unbearable situation?

2307
02:26:59,625 --> 02:27:04,625
Or should I end the suffering of this body

2308
02:27:04,708 --> 02:27:06,875
and fling it into the abyss of death?

2309
02:27:07,791 --> 02:27:12,833
Put an end to everybody!
Me, you, and him too.

2310
02:27:15,291 --> 02:27:19,166
May death overpower life

2311
02:27:19,458 --> 02:27:23,916
and reduce it to a state of endless sleep.

2312
02:27:27,333 --> 02:27:31,458
But what if dreams invade
that sleep as well?

2313
02:27:34,500 --> 02:27:36,333
That is the important part.

2314
02:27:37,416 --> 02:27:42,125
I am not brave enough to venture
into a new and unknown territory.

2315
02:27:42,458 --> 02:27:45,958
That is why I tolerate this old existence.

2316
02:27:46,833 --> 02:27:51,666
I tolerate the crushing
of my self-respect like a lifeless corpse.

2317
02:27:51,833 --> 02:27:55,333
I tolerate the mockery of my existence

2318
02:27:55,500 --> 02:28:01,916
and finally beg for mercy
at the feet of my own killers.

2319
02:28:04,791 --> 02:28:07,833
Oh, Almighty, why have you been so cruel?

2320
02:28:08,916 --> 02:28:12,500
On one hand, the children we gave birth to
have abandoned us.

2321
02:28:13,291 --> 02:28:18,125
And on the other hand,
You who created us, deserted us too.

2322
02:28:18,833 --> 02:28:22,958
Now, where do these old bones seek refuge?

2323
02:28:23,208 --> 02:28:26,666
And at whose feet do they lie, my Lord?

2324
02:28:27,625 --> 02:28:28,708
Tell me.

2325
02:28:39,291 --> 02:28:41,041
Appa, are you all right?

2326
02:28:49,250 --> 02:28:50,416
He is with me.

2327
02:28:50,625 --> 02:28:51,875
Who is this old man?

2328
02:28:51,958 --> 02:28:54,958
Not just some old man,
he is a renowned actor.

2329
02:28:59,750 --> 02:29:05,333
<span style="style.default_1">Chandra is humming a song</span>

2330
02:29:07,375 --> 02:29:08,791
<span style="style.default_1">Seems like</span>

2331
02:29:10,541 --> 02:29:14,541
<span style="style.default_1">The gleaming moonlight shone</span>

2332
02:29:14,875 --> 02:29:17,583
<span style="style.default_1">All over the earth</span>

2333
02:29:17,708 --> 02:29:18,708
Ram,

2334
02:29:20,625 --> 02:29:22,708
you're singing so well.

2335
02:29:29,791 --> 02:29:31,791
If you had controlled your weight,

2336
02:29:31,875 --> 02:29:36,250
Bal Gandharv would have been reduced
to playing a chambermaid all his life!

2337
02:29:39,625 --> 02:29:41,916
You neglected your body.

2338
02:29:42,916 --> 02:29:44,541
What brings you here?

2339
02:29:45,708 --> 02:29:47,666
-I had to come.
-What for?

2340
02:29:48,541 --> 02:29:49,791
-Belwalkar.
-Yes?

2341
02:29:49,958 --> 02:29:52,708
I heard about your melodrama
in the theater.

2342
02:29:52,916 --> 02:29:55,000
-I see.
-I thought that I should see you.

2343
02:29:55,875 --> 02:29:56,916
Why?

2344
02:29:57,791 --> 02:30:01,458
Have you come to pay tribute
to this mediocre actor?

2345
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:08,083
-Are you out of your mind?
-Yes.

2346
02:30:08,208 --> 02:30:09,541
No, not at all.

2347
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:16,291
Hamlet was one of
the few memorable roles that you played.

2348
02:30:17,958 --> 02:30:19,291
It was unforgettable

2349
02:30:19,375 --> 02:30:21,666
because you captured the soul
of the character.

2350
02:30:21,916 --> 02:30:24,083
-Rascal.
-What?

2351
02:30:24,166 --> 02:30:26,083
You will never change.

2352
02:30:26,416 --> 02:30:28,416
-Where are you going?
-I'll be right back.

2353
02:30:28,625 --> 02:30:30,791
"Few memorable roles."

2354
02:30:32,166 --> 02:30:35,958
Even your praise is laced with sarcasm.

2355
02:30:39,291 --> 02:30:44,083
All I did was mediocre,
and all your roles are works of art.

2356
02:30:45,833 --> 02:30:47,708
Was I that lucky?

2357
02:30:48,375 --> 02:30:53,125
All the great roles
were always reserved for you!

2358
02:30:54,125 --> 02:30:56,333
Yes, right!

2359
02:30:57,250 --> 02:30:58,458
What is that?

2360
02:30:58,708 --> 02:31:00,708
My dear,

2361
02:31:01,083 --> 02:31:04,708
you can't just eat peanuts.
Not without a drink.

2362
02:31:05,708 --> 02:31:07,583
Is this what you drink these days?

2363
02:31:07,708 --> 02:31:10,416
I am used to this brand now.

2364
02:31:11,958 --> 02:31:15,666
There was a time when your romantic scenes

2365
02:31:15,916 --> 02:31:19,000
with leading actresses
used to be so intense!

2366
02:31:21,375 --> 02:31:23,625
Look who's talking!

2367
02:31:25,041 --> 02:31:28,041
The pot is calling the kettle black.

2368
02:31:29,083 --> 02:31:31,666
You used to run after the actresses.

2369
02:31:31,916 --> 02:31:35,791
"My dear, your lines are falling flat.

2370
02:31:36,333 --> 02:31:39,666
You must feel the emotions from within."

2371
02:31:41,833 --> 02:31:45,000
Everyone knew what you really meant.

2372
02:31:45,375 --> 02:31:46,500
Scoundrel.

2373
02:31:49,625 --> 02:31:51,125
It wasn't blackmail.

2374
02:31:51,958 --> 02:31:55,708
Nobody takes
an actor's emotions seriously.

2375
02:31:56,416 --> 02:31:59,958
Not just the emotions,
they don't even take the person seriously.

2376
02:32:02,041 --> 02:32:05,208
You have chosen a lovely place
It's airy and spacious.

2377
02:32:06,166 --> 02:32:07,666
Yes, make my situation worse.

2378
02:32:09,083 --> 02:32:10,666
No, it's not that.

2379
02:32:12,833 --> 02:32:15,208
But I am glad
that I don't have any children.

2380
02:32:17,625 --> 02:32:18,916
How lucky you are!

2381
02:32:21,666 --> 02:32:22,916
Give me some more.

2382
02:32:24,833 --> 02:32:25,958
Oh, is it empty now?

2383
02:32:26,666 --> 02:32:28,791
-I'll get some more.
-Oh, no.

2384
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:30,916
No need.

2385
02:32:31,666 --> 02:32:32,583
Are you sure?

2386
02:32:34,375 --> 02:32:35,416
Ganpat.

2387
02:32:37,166 --> 02:32:39,500
Does anyone recognize you in this state?

2388
02:32:40,458 --> 02:32:43,791
I don't recognize myself anymore,
forget about the others.

2389
02:32:44,666 --> 02:32:46,541
At times, it scares me.

2390
02:32:47,375 --> 02:32:49,708
What if someone recognizes me,

2391
02:32:50,458 --> 02:32:53,041
feels sorry for my state,
and takes me home?

2392
02:32:54,041 --> 02:32:55,541
What does that mean?

2393
02:32:57,208 --> 02:33:01,166
An actor's life is like,
"Out of sight out of mind."

2394
02:33:03,083 --> 02:33:05,375
Ganpat, you shouldn't have retired.

2395
02:33:11,208 --> 02:33:15,958
Being an actor seeps into your cells,
it stays there.

2396
02:33:16,666 --> 02:33:19,375
We wear the masks of the characters

2397
02:33:20,250 --> 02:33:22,166
and lose our real identities.

2398
02:33:23,708 --> 02:33:25,458
An actor is forgotten,

2399
02:33:27,166 --> 02:33:28,500
but the roles he plays

2400
02:33:30,500 --> 02:33:31,708
live forever.

2401
02:33:33,208 --> 02:33:36,708
God knows what lives on and what dies.

2402
02:33:38,125 --> 02:33:41,083
Don't you remember how Pant lost his mind?

2403
02:33:42,166 --> 02:33:44,291
Goodness.

2404
02:33:44,875 --> 02:33:47,416
He died thinking he was Tukaram himself!

2405
02:33:48,458 --> 02:33:49,333
Ram.

2406
02:33:50,416 --> 02:33:51,666
Ram.

2407
02:33:53,708 --> 02:33:55,916
Why are you calling me Ram?

2408
02:33:56,916 --> 02:33:58,958
-You drink too much, you old man.
-Where is he?

2409
02:33:59,083 --> 02:34:00,125
You're drunk.

2410
02:34:01,166 --> 02:34:03,166
I am Mohammed.

2411
02:34:03,875 --> 02:34:05,375
You'll start a fuss.

2412
02:34:06,416 --> 02:34:07,916
You should go sleep.

2413
02:34:13,333 --> 02:34:15,291
<span style="style.default_1">I've seen him outside the theater.</span>

2414
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:17,708
Where did you see him?

2415
02:34:18,583 --> 02:34:20,291
At Shivaji Theater.

2416
02:34:20,583 --> 02:34:23,041
He lives with a man who polishes shoes.

2417
02:34:30,416 --> 02:34:32,791
-Father, have you found Grandpa?
-Yes, darling.

2418
02:34:33,208 --> 02:34:34,416
<span style="style.default_1">Where is he?</span>

2419
02:34:34,958 --> 02:34:36,916
Hey, you divine forces!

2420
02:34:39,833 --> 02:34:42,916
Give me the tenacity of rocks.

2421
02:34:43,916 --> 02:34:47,500
Bless me with patience.

2422
02:34:52,666 --> 02:34:55,416
Wow, such work of art.

2423
02:34:57,000 --> 02:34:58,875
Siddharth.

2424
02:35:00,166 --> 02:35:04,125
These epics were created by
legendary writers.

2425
02:35:04,791 --> 02:35:07,000
We were mere messengers.

2426
02:35:11,041 --> 02:35:14,666
Ram Ganesh, Shripadrao, Kakasaheb,

2427
02:35:15,166 --> 02:35:18,500
Annasaheb, Vijayrao, Mamasaheb...

2428
02:35:18,708 --> 02:35:21,125
Each deadlier than the other.

2429
02:35:23,458 --> 02:35:28,375
They would thrive on by pulling
at the heartstrings of the audience.

2430
02:35:29,041 --> 02:35:30,791
They were scavengers.

2431
02:35:32,333 --> 02:35:37,375
Seeing the audience cry brought a smile
on their wicked faces.

2432
02:35:38,291 --> 02:35:40,000
But they all have vanished now.

2433
02:35:40,958 --> 02:35:47,083
They filled my body
with the ghosts of so many characters.

2434
02:35:48,333 --> 02:35:49,500
Sudhakara!

2435
02:35:50,208 --> 02:35:51,125
Taliram!

2436
02:35:51,791 --> 02:35:53,125
Othello!

2437
02:35:53,708 --> 02:35:54,875
Caesar!

2438
02:35:55,916 --> 02:35:57,166
Henry! Beckett!

2439
02:35:57,250 --> 02:35:59,708
Where the hell are you hiding?

2440
02:36:01,125 --> 02:36:02,291
You rascals!

2441
02:36:02,583 --> 02:36:07,833
I gave your grief an identity.

2442
02:36:08,500 --> 02:36:10,291
I made it bigger than my life.

2443
02:36:10,708 --> 02:36:12,166
But what about me?

2444
02:36:12,958 --> 02:36:15,583
Isn't my grief as real as yours?

2445
02:36:16,291 --> 02:36:18,041
It is like a sharp knife,

2446
02:36:18,375 --> 02:36:21,500
searing through my heart
yet no one seems to notice.

2447
02:36:22,875 --> 02:36:26,416
How much humiliation
do I have to go through

2448
02:36:26,708 --> 02:36:30,291
for my grief to be as valid as yours?

2449
02:36:31,875 --> 02:36:35,666
I showed your tears.

2450
02:36:36,708 --> 02:36:41,083
But you never valued this actor's grief.

2451
02:36:42,083 --> 02:36:44,708
I may not get justice anywhere
in the world.

2452
02:36:44,875 --> 02:36:47,666
But shouldn't I find it here?
On this stage?

2453
02:36:47,833 --> 02:36:49,250
-Father!
-Yes?

2454
02:36:51,583 --> 02:36:53,000
Who is it? Caesar?

2455
02:36:54,291 --> 02:36:55,291
Caesar?

2456
02:36:55,458 --> 02:36:56,708
Father, it's me, Makrand.

2457
02:36:58,708 --> 02:37:00,000
Makrand, who?

2458
02:37:00,333 --> 02:37:03,500
Father, all of us are here
to take you back.

2459
02:37:04,166 --> 02:37:05,708
You're really here?

2460
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:08,166
Of course, Father.

2461
02:37:08,291 --> 02:37:09,958
Where will you take me?

2462
02:37:11,208 --> 02:37:12,458
Back home, Father.

2463
02:37:13,125 --> 02:37:14,625
Back to our home.

2464
02:37:16,958 --> 02:37:19,958
Where had you been?
We've been looking for you.

2465
02:37:21,041 --> 02:37:23,416
I was looking for you as well.

2466
02:37:23,541 --> 02:37:25,583
But you were nowhere to be found.

2467
02:37:26,291 --> 02:37:27,458
Then I lost my way.

2468
02:37:30,708 --> 02:37:32,083
Father, we were wrong.

2469
02:37:36,833 --> 02:37:37,916
We are ashamed.

2470
02:37:39,708 --> 02:37:40,708
Is that so?

2471
02:37:41,083 --> 02:37:43,833
Good.

2472
02:37:44,833 --> 02:37:46,291
Father, where is Mother?

2473
02:37:46,833 --> 02:37:47,875
Your mother?

2474
02:37:50,625 --> 02:37:52,041
She found her way.

2475
02:37:52,791 --> 02:37:53,916
She reached her destination.

2476
02:37:58,166 --> 02:37:59,083
Where is she?

2477
02:38:00,166 --> 02:38:02,458
How would I know?

2478
02:38:06,375 --> 02:38:07,375
What do you mean?

2479
02:38:07,958 --> 02:38:08,916
She died

2480
02:38:11,083 --> 02:38:12,208
in the street.

2481
02:38:13,791 --> 02:38:16,291
We arranged for her funeral.

2482
02:38:21,500 --> 02:38:22,458
Appa!

2483
02:38:23,666 --> 02:38:25,708
Think hard before you make a decision.

2484
02:38:27,083 --> 02:38:29,375
They already threw you out
on the streets once before.

2485
02:38:31,708 --> 02:38:34,958
Go ahead and sign off your wealth to them.

2486
02:38:35,541 --> 02:38:37,625
-I am here for you.
-Shut up!

2487
02:38:37,708 --> 02:38:39,791
Don't you dare, officer!

2488
02:38:41,166 --> 02:38:43,041
Don't you dare touch him!

2489
02:38:46,500 --> 02:38:50,375
Put your swords back in their sheaths,
they will rust away in the night.

2490
02:38:52,375 --> 02:38:55,541
Officer, this is a theater,
and it's my kingdom.

2491
02:38:56,416 --> 02:38:57,583
You don't rule here.

2492
02:38:59,791 --> 02:39:03,208
Go to your territory where you are needed.

2493
02:39:05,166 --> 02:39:08,125
This is not a place to dance
in your dirty shoes.

2494
02:39:08,625 --> 02:39:11,791
Here you will find the
footprints of my mentors.

2495
02:39:11,875 --> 02:39:12,833
Go!

2496
02:39:13,666 --> 02:39:14,791
Get out!

2497
02:39:15,458 --> 02:39:16,291
Go.

2498
02:39:17,125 --> 02:39:18,250
Raja.

2499
02:39:19,208 --> 02:39:20,958
Are you hurt?

2500
02:39:22,166 --> 02:39:24,000
No, I am fine.

2501
02:39:24,250 --> 02:39:27,458
We have to go home.

2502
02:39:29,166 --> 02:39:31,666
Rukhsana must be worried.

2503
02:39:31,916 --> 02:39:33,416
I didn't inform her before leaving.

2504
02:39:33,541 --> 02:39:34,416
Father,

2505
02:39:35,458 --> 02:39:37,250
are you still upset with us?

2506
02:39:42,083 --> 02:39:46,708
Anger and greed are now
beyond me, my children.

2507
02:39:49,083 --> 02:39:52,708
Now, it's time to celebrate.

2508
02:39:54,166 --> 02:39:57,375
It's time to begin a new show.

2509
02:39:58,791 --> 02:40:01,208
I can hear the final bell.

2510
02:40:03,416 --> 02:40:08,208
My actress is already
on the stage, waiting for me.

2511
02:40:08,833 --> 02:40:11,625
Father, enough of this and
come back home with us--

2512
02:40:11,708 --> 02:40:13,416
Stay away!

2513
02:40:16,000 --> 02:40:18,291
Stay away! Everything is pointless now.

2514
02:40:19,916 --> 02:40:23,916
Caesar doesn't plead for anyone's mercy.

2515
02:40:24,375 --> 02:40:27,500
Neither does he forgive the one
who pleads.

2516
02:40:27,875 --> 02:40:29,000
Stay away!

2517
02:40:33,708 --> 02:40:38,291
Now, I strive to be like
the immovable North Star.

2518
02:40:39,333 --> 02:40:42,791
Just like Julius Caesar did
in his own time.

2519
02:40:44,875 --> 02:40:46,333
And I am the chosen one.

2520
02:40:47,041 --> 02:40:50,125
Standing tall before you.

2521
02:40:50,708 --> 02:40:52,166
I am Julius Caesar!

2522
02:40:54,583 --> 02:40:56,500
I am Prataprao.

2523
02:40:56,708 --> 02:40:58,208
I'm Othello.

2524
02:40:58,333 --> 02:41:00,208
Sudhakar and Hamlet and...

2525
02:41:00,458 --> 02:41:04,333
I am Ganpat Ramchandra Belwalkar,
the King of Theater!

2526
02:41:07,166 --> 02:41:10,875
All the great men reside in my body now.

2527
02:41:11,708 --> 02:41:15,791
And a great man's heart
tempts the daggers of his killers.

2528
02:41:20,125 --> 02:41:22,291
All the killers have surrounded me.

2529
02:41:24,541 --> 02:41:28,000
They have their daggers drawn,
but I must face them.

2530
02:41:31,541 --> 02:41:33,500
-Father!
-Father!

2531
02:41:38,583 --> 02:41:39,708
Father!

2532
02:41:41,666 --> 02:41:42,916
Brutus!

2533
02:41:47,125 --> 02:41:48,291
-Appa!
-Father!

2534
02:41:58,708 --> 02:42:01,416
Do you get it now, Siddharth?

2535
02:42:02,708 --> 02:42:06,833
This is what theater acting
is all about, my dear.

2536
02:42:11,541 --> 02:42:12,500
Father!

2537
02:42:13,416 --> 02:42:14,416
Father, no!

2538
02:42:15,708 --> 02:42:16,708
Father!

2539
02:42:17,666 --> 02:42:18,791
Get up, Father!

2540
02:42:19,250 --> 02:42:20,250
Do something.

2541
02:42:38,125 --> 02:42:43,833
<span style="style.default_1">My role in the play is over now</span>

2542
02:42:46,125 --> 02:42:51,083
<span style="style.default_1">My role in the play is over now</span>

2543
02:42:51,333 --> 02:42:56,291
<span style="style.default_1">I found my stage in the darkness</span>

2544
02:42:56,750 --> 02:43:01,625
<span style="style.default_1">But out of this darkness</span>

2545
02:43:01,875 --> 02:43:05,375
<span style="style.default_1">A new stage will emerge soon</span>

2546
02:43:09,541 --> 02:43:14,791
<span style="style.default_1">The curtain rose after the music,
and I was full to the brim</span>

2547
02:43:16,125 --> 02:43:19,125
<span style="style.default_1">with a thousand colorful words,</span>

2548
02:43:20,541 --> 02:43:24,083
<span style="style.default_1">surrounded by numerous expressions</span>

2549
02:43:24,250 --> 02:43:27,666
<span style="style.default_1">of fear, hope, and expectation.</span>

2550
02:43:28,958 --> 02:43:31,375
<span style="style.default_1">And once the curtain came down,</span>

2551
02:43:31,541 --> 02:43:33,916
<span style="style.default_1">the auditorium emptied out.</span>

2552
02:43:34,583 --> 02:43:39,208
<span style="style.default_1">And there, I stood, waiting to begin
a journey that is not scripted.</span>

2553
02:43:40,375 --> 02:43:41,500
<span style="style.default_1">Alone.</span>

2554
02:43:42,666 --> 02:43:46,708
<span style="style.default_1">Completely empty like the auditorium
in front of me.</span>

2555
02:43:48,083 --> 02:43:49,125
<span style="style.default_1">Of course.</span>

2556
02:43:49,375 --> 02:43:55,958
<span style="style.default_1">Some of my words
from the play still float in the air</span>

2557
02:43:56,416 --> 02:43:57,916
<span style="style.default_1">even now!</span>

2558
02:43:58,875 --> 02:44:00,541
<span style="style.default_1">Some of my gestures</span>

2559
02:44:00,708 --> 02:44:04,291
<span style="style.default_1">are clinging to the arms
of the empty chairs</span>

2560
02:44:04,375 --> 02:44:06,041
<span style="style.default_1">even now!</span>

2561
02:44:06,375 --> 02:44:08,958
<span style="style.default_1">Some of my happy and sad moments</span>

2562
02:44:09,375 --> 02:44:14,083
<span style="style.default_1">lie shivering on the walls
like drops of rain</span>

2563
02:44:14,458 --> 02:44:16,000
<span style="style.default_1">even now!</span>

2564
02:44:17,625 --> 02:44:18,708
<span style="style.default_1">That's all.</span>

2565
02:44:19,250 --> 02:44:22,791
<span style="style.default_1">That is the only relief to my emptiness.</span>

2566
02:44:24,083 --> 02:44:26,958
<span style="style.default_1">I'm disappointed that the play has ended.</span>

2567
02:44:27,833 --> 02:44:28,958
<span style="style.default_1">Not just the play,</span>

2568
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:33,708
<span style="style.default_1">but my entire existence contained
in those three hours has come to an end.</span>

2569
02:44:34,625 --> 02:44:37,500
<span style="style.default_1">But it has ended here for me.</span>

2570
02:44:38,958 --> 02:44:42,041
<span style="style.default_1">Thousands of spectators
have taken home with them</span>

2571
02:44:42,708 --> 02:44:45,125
<span style="style.default_1">an essence of my existence.</span>

2572
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:48,833
<span style="style.default_1">And I, a single being,</span>

2573
02:44:49,500 --> 02:44:52,000
<span style="style.default_1">have been distributed, bit by bit,</span>

2574
02:44:52,208 --> 02:44:54,666
<span style="style.default_1">to the lives of thousands of spectators.</span>

2575
02:44:56,500 --> 02:44:57,458
<span style="style.default_1">And perhaps,</span>

2576
02:44:58,833 --> 02:45:00,416
<span style="style.default_1">in their memory as well.</span>

2577
02:45:06,583 --> 02:45:13,458
...A NEW ROLE AWAITS
