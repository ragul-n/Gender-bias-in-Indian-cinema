00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,800
Sorry I am late, sir.
For once the train came on time.

16
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,200
How's work?

17
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,900
Good.
But the flies are too many.

18
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:57,700
I hope they haven't fallen
into the milk.

19
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,900
How is Mr Mishra?

20
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:00,900
Everything's okay.

21
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,000
This is Doctor Manohar Rao

22
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,000
He is here on an official visit.

23
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,000
I'm glad you brought him.
So much illness here and no doctor!

24
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,300
He's not a medial doctor.
He is a veterinarian.

25
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,400
Can your horse manage
such a load?

26
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,000
Don't worry, Sir.
He can carry twice as much.

27
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:36,200
Come along.
Nothing will happen to the horse.

28
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:40,500
No, I'll walk.
Is it far from here?

29
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,600
Yes, it is.

30
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,600
Never mind.
We'll meet there.

31
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:56,500
What's keeping you?
Are you feeling sorry for the horse?

32
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:25,600
[ Shree Ganganath Dairy
Property of Shree Mishra ]

33
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,900
Mr Mahapatra, your assistant
is not with you?

34
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,400
Assistant?

35
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,800
He is not my assistant.

36
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:53,300
He is the leader of the team
sent here by the Dairy Board.

37
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,800
He has come to set up
a milk cooperative society.

38
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:06,300
A milk cooperative
in this area?

39
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:11,300
I've said repeatedly that
I know this region.

40
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,600
But who listens?

41
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:23,900
Only those with foreign qualification
get their way these days.

42
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,900
Experience has no value.

43
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:31,000
Sound advice.

44
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,300
But for these people it is like
playing the flute to a buffalo.

45
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,200
Don't worry.

46
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,800
Young people are idealists.

47
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,700
They want to change the world
overnight.

48
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:02,900
That's all very well.
But it only shows their foolishness.

49
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:06,600
This idealism is sheer nonsense.

50
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,700
Experience comes with age.

51
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:14,200
It is good that they have ideals
or how will they lose them?

52
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,800
It is a trait
that's disappearing fast.

53
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,700
This country badly needs
dedicated youth.

54
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,100
Jeevan, where are you hiding?

55
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,400
Go, fetch my tea, quick.

56
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,600
See if Dr Rao is up yet or not.

57
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,600
-How are you?
-I'm okay.

58
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,500
-Is that your cow?
-Yes, sir.

59
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,400
-How much milk does it yield?
-Four litres.

60
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:10,300
Do you use it at home
or do you sell it?

61
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,260
We sell it.

62
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:14,100
-To whom?
-To the Mishra dairy.

63
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,000
At what price?

64
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,200
One rupee per litre.

65
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,100
Just that?
Is there a contract?

66
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,600
Yes.

67
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,300
-How has he fixed the price?
-God knows.

68
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,300
Jeevan, where has Rao gone
so early in this awful cold?

69
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:35,300
I don't know.

70
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:41,900
Fine thing for us
if he comes down with pneumonia.

71
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,700
Is there anyone here?

72
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,900
Boy, is your father home?

73
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:43,600
The father is right here.
What do you want?

74
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,600
Is your husband here?

75
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,700
But who are you?

76
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,700
I represent the Cooperative Society.

77
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:55,300
Do you own land or manage
on what you earn by selling milk?

78
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:58,900
The have-less children people
came and went. Now what is it?

79
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:02,300
Can I have a sample of this milk?

80
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,800
Sample nothing! Just leave!

81
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,600
All the villagers have agreed.
A little will do.

82
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:15,600
A little? Little by little
you'll take the lot.

83
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,500
Why are you following me?

84
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:34,500
You're a thief.

85
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,800
Rubbish.

86
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,700
You've been stealing.

87
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:41,200
You wouldn't give the sample.

88
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,700
But you took it.

89
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,700
You stole it!
I'll call everyone here.

90
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:53,900
Bhagla was there. I left the milk
and went inside, and he stole some.

91
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,100
An educated man like you,
stealing.

92
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,900
You citified dandies come
to our villages to steal from us?

93
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,800
Today you stole milk, tomorrow
it will be something else.

94
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,000
These city fellows are all rogues!

95
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:22,860
God knows what really is
in those bottles.

96
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:25,400
What happened?
Why the crowd?

97
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,800
Stealing, what else!

98
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,900
He stole milk from my house.

99
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:36,000
Can't you see he is
an honest man?

100
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,700
Go home, all of you.

101
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:42,300
Doctor,
come with me in the car.

102
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:45,100
Bhola, take these people away.

103
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,500
-Thank you very much.
-You're welcome.

104
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,300
Are you acompanying
Mahapatra?

105
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,800
Yes.

106
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:21,000
My villagers are like children.
Please, don't be upset.

107
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:25,500
-What happened?
-I was collecting milk samples.

108
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:30,800
I've heard you want to start
a milk cooperative.

109
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
The system we have currently
is not satisfactory?

110
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,900
Who can decide that?

111
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,000
You must be an idealist.

112
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,900
We have been living here
for thirty years.

113
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:52,500
All the villagers are my clients.
I know each one by name.

114
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:57,300
I know their financial conditions,
how many in each family…

115
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:05,800
When you leave in six months
the Cooperative will collapse.

116
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:10,700
In the bargain, my own business
will be finished.

117
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:14,400
And my ties with the villagers
will be broken.

118
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,200
Do you really think so?

119
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:22,300
Mr Mishra,
I have taken milk samples.

120
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:25,100
I am certain they are rich
in fat content.

121
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:31,100
You buy their milk by weight,
so the villagers add water to it.

122
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:36,300
Your price is so low that
they are compelled to do that.

123
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:43,100
Mr Mishra, it is you
who live off the cream.

124
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,800
Young man, I have built
the economy of this area.

125
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:05,400
True. Your methods
worked years ago.

126
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:10,100
Today they are obsolete.

127
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:15,460
What proof that yours
will be effective?

128
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,400
Progress is not necessarily
brought about by change.

129
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:24,200
We are not concerned
with who owns the dairy.

130
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:29,400
We want the benefits for the milk producers,
who are all poor farmers.

131
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,200
This can only be achieved
with a cooperative.

132
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,600
Doctor, I am like
an elder brother to you.

133
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,800
My advice is to drop
this nonsense.

134
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:46,100
You are a vet. Stay there
and look after animals.

135
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:50,500
Teach the villagers to lead
a clean and planned family life.

136
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:54,300
Our country's progress depends
on high thinking, hard work…

137
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:58,800
wholesome food,
planned families.

138
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:02,000
You say all this to prevent
any threat to your business?

139
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,900
Anyway, you are our guest.

140
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:14,200
If you need anything,
please, ask.

141
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:19,100
If you like, I'll send brandy
or something this evening.

142
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,500
No, thank you.

143
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,660
Come and have some tea.

144
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:35,100
No tea, please.
I don't indulge.

145
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:45,000
-Where did you go?
-To look at some villages.

146
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,700
I would have shown you better,
bigger villages.

147
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,900
I still can,
I must get dressed anyhow.

148
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:54,300
Let's go. I have to wire my team
to come here.

149
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,600
Did you find the house easily?

150
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,600
It isn't Taj Mahal
but it will do.

151
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:38,000
Is the method you followed
in the past the only way?

152
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:41,600
The Cooperative Society
will belong to all of you.

153
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:46,500
Ganganath Dairy is owned
by the man: Mishra.

154
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:49,600
Who benefits? Mishra.

155
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:55,300
Managing it yourselves,
this society will benefit all of you.

156
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,060
The milk will go directly
to the government dairy.

157
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,860
That's 40 miles away!

158
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:05,699
Once the coop is formed,
we will arrange for trucks.

159
00:17:05,739 --> 00:17:08,800
Milk from 7 or 8 villagers
will go in one truck.

160
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:11,760
-Mr Mishra won't like it.
-Not one bit.

161
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:15,699
Because his profits will reduce
and yours will increase.

162
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,400
Who can join your society?

163
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:21,900
Anyone with at least
one cow or buffalo.

164
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:25,200
Those with more cattle
will have more rights?

165
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,400
No. Equal rights for all.

166
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:30,900
Members will together
elect a commitee

167
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:35,100
for collecting the milk,
testing it, keeping accounts.

168
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:38,600
It will have a chairman
who will be elected by you.

169
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:44,100
Our village head has 25 buffaloes
so he should be chairman.

170
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,300
This will be settled by votes.

171
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:57,700
Doctor Sahib, I've been
the village headman for 15 years.

172
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:03,400
It is with my backing that
the society is being formed.

173
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,100
Is there no difference between me
and these peasants?

174
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:12,600
A coop does not discriminate
between caste or class.

175
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,300
These words are
for public speeches.

176
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,900
But sir, we are all
out-castes.

177
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:26,900
You think that will debar you
from the society? Not at all.

178
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,800
The cooperative is open
to all castes.

179
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:36,300
Forget the rights. Talk of money.
When can we get loans?

180
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,700
Don't worry, sir.
We will vote for your party.

181
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:44,200
Quiet! You will neither
get money from us

182
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,800
nor are we canvassing
for any political party.

183
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,300
Without giving loans,
what use is a society?

184
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,300
We are poor people.
We need money.

185
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,000
Give it later
if not now.

186
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:04,300
Stand up for yourselves
and not beg for charity.

187
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:14,100
Thank you, sir, for your kindness,
but will that make us less poor?

188
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,400
We only understand money,
nothing else.

189
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,900
Mishra gives us loans.
Can you do the same?

190
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:27,000
You can't understand
what we are saying.

191
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:32,200
We have understood!
May I say something?

192
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,900
What is it?

193
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:39,200
I think you city people
are crooks.

194
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,800
What do you mean?

195
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,400
Think what you like.

196
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:49,000
I understand your kind.

197
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,500
Your tricks won't work here!

198
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,800
Where is Dr Rao's house?

199
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,400
Dr Rao?

200
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,400
Everyone out.

201
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,500
-The lavatory?
-Outside.

202
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:31,900
Outside?

203
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:21,800
Sir, I feel feverish,
I think it's malaria.

204
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,800
Not at all.

205
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:33,400
I'll catch it soon enough.
So many mosquitoes.

206
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,700
You have a mosquito-net,
don't you?

207
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:40,900
Had I known this,
I'd never have come.

208
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:48,800
Sir, on my way here, I met a man
with the face of a murderer.

209
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,760
Probably Bhola.

210
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,300
You meet such crazy people
in villages.

211
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:56,200
He won't attack you.
Go to sleep.

212
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,260
Who is it?

213
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:12,300
I don't know.
He's run away.

214
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Must be him, Bhola.

215
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:31,260
Did you find the money that day?
I left it near the door.

216
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:34,700
Yes. But won't sell
any milk to you.

217
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,800
You prefer to deal
with Mishra?

218
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,800
He's a two-faced liar.

219
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:54,200
Why is he crying?
Son, what's you name?

220
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,600
Bhagla.

221
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,500
Why do you talk so
of Mishra?

222
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:05,100
Ask in the village.
He cheats us all.

223
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,900
Then it's better
you sell to us.

224
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:13,100
Stealing little at a time.
God knows why.

225
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:17,000
It's not stealing.
I test the milk for its content.

226
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,400
Do you mean I add water to it?

227
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,300
My buffalo gives three litres.

228
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:28,400
Crooked people think
crooked thoughts.

229
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,300
Where is your husband?

230
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:53,200
Who knows?
Must be lying drunk somewhere.

231
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I haven't seen him
for 4 months.

232
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:05,900
Quiet. Go inside.

233
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:09,000
How many castes
are there in this village?

234
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,900
See, first our caste.

235
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:17,500
Then there are farmers, potters,
shepherds, Rajputs and barbers.

236
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:21,200
The village headman,
what's he like?

237
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:25,800
He is an important man.
Why do you ask?

238
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,700
He doesn't help us at all.

239
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,600
And this rogue, Bhola?

240
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,900
Don't call him that, sahib.

241
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:42,700
He sees city people
and he gets mad.

242
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,100
Why did he come here?

243
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,500
How is that your concern?

244
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,760
It's best to keep
such people away.

245
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,500
I know their ways.

246
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,000
These people won't even let us sleep.

247
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:26,100
They won't let us be…
throw stones, bang at doors.

248
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,000
Who is it?

249
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,700
I'm coming!

250
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:52,500
Doctor sahib, come, quick.

251
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:54,300
-What's the matter?
-My son. He is dying!

252
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:58,800
He's burning with fever.
My brother has gone to the doctor.

253
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:02,600
The doctor will come tomorrow.
By then it will be too…

254
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,300
But I am a vet.

255
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:08,700
When you can treat animals,
you can treat people.

256
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:13,900
Give him an injection.
My Dhanie will be saved. Save him.

257
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,600
Boil some water.

258
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,900
And bring some soap.

259
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:55,700
 __ are you going to give an injection __ 

260
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,600
His condition is bad.

261
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,300
Do you realise
it's highly unethical?

262
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,800
Do you have
a better suggestion?

263
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,700
You'll ruin us both.

264
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,100
Hold the baby.

265
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:09,600
By morning the fever will be gone.
Give this note to the doctor.

266
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,300
What's the time, Deshmukh?

267
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,000
Six.

268
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,100
Come, let's go.

269
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:25,800
Is this the way to play
with a human being's life?

270
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,700
And if the child recovers?

271
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:29,300
What if he dies?

272
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,400
That's the risk one takes.

273
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,700
You will drag me down as well?

274
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,900
Sir, they are looking for you.

275
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,800
Where is the animal?

276
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,400
I need to be treated…

277
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,700
But he is a vet!

278
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,400
They've come for medical attention.

279
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,500
But I can't treat you.

280
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:36,900
You cured Moti's son.
Please, make him well too.

281
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:42,700
Deshmukh, my bag, please.

282
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:49,400
Do you intend to
set up practice?

283
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:53,800
For some time. There isn't
even a primary health centre here.

284
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,400
How is the child?

285
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:11,000
All thanks to you.
He is well now.

286
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,300
Sahib, we have come to enrol ourselves.

287
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,000
-Who?
-Us.

288
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,300
How many?

289
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:26,100
Look, Moti, 3 or 4 persons
cannot form a cooperative.

290
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:29,000
At least 40 persons
are required.

291
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:35,200
Where will they come from?
They all go to Mishra's dairy.

292
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,900
Please, enrol us in the society.

293
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:40,900
Take this medicine.

294
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:51,100
Doctor sahib, here is
some milk for you.

295
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:51,960
For me?

296
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,360
You saved my son.

297
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,800
I only did what I had to.

298
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,900
You must take this milk.
It's absolutely fresh.

299
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,600
If you insist.
But I will pay for it.

300
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,300
Let me show you
how milk is tested.

301
00:34:10,299 --> 00:34:14,199
The milk is pure, sahib.
Not a drop of water in it.

302
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:17,900
It's a gift from us.
Don't think of water, then.

303
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,699
Note the fat content.

304
00:34:45,739 --> 00:34:47,000
That's good.

305
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,600
What's the quality?

306
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:52,600
2 rupees, 2 paisa
for one litre.

307
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,400
Mishra never gave us that much.

308
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,600
He buys by weight.
We buy for the fat content.

309
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,400
Your milk is very rich.

310
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,400
The more fat,
the better the price.

311
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,700
[ Current price: 1.60 ]

312
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:32,300
What are you doing?

313
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,400
From now, the milk price
is 1.25 rupee per litre.

314
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,800
Why have you brought down
your price?

315
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,600
Sell it for that
or take your milk back.

316
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:45,500
The milk will go bad, won't it?

317
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:51,000
The society people give
2 rupees, 2 paisa per litre!

318
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,200
Then you go
and sell to them.

319
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,000
When that set-up closes,
don't come crying to us.

320
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:59,300
First you offer us lower prices.
Then you are rude to us.

321
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:04,360
We won't sell the milk to these pimps
from now on.

322
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,900
We'll go to the Society people.

323
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,100
Why put ideas into her head?

324
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:12,900
I have to repay his debt.

325
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:16,000
Forget him. Come on.

326
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:30,560
Don't put on airs. You still
have to pay for your buffalo.

327
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,900
I spit on you.

328
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:48,300
Sir, something's stuck
in my throat.

329
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:49,700
It's nothing.

330
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:53,300
Is that Shanta-Bhabi's letter?

331
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,500
What's happening?
They're rushing in, sir.

332
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,200
What, have you fallen ill too?

333
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:07,100
Ill? Not at all.

334
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:15,800
Why have they come?

335
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,900
Sahib, from today
we are not going to Mishra.

336
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:22,860
We will sell the milk to you.
Test it.

337
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:26,500
For your sake we've added
less water.

338
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:28,300
It's true, sahib.

339
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:33,800
Has Mishra refused the milk?

340
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:39,200
Mishra pays less and less.
And orders us to return the next day.

341
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,400
What do you want to tell them?

342
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:53,500
We said we need more people
to form the society.

343
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:54,800
Here they are.

344
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:58,500
If we refuse
they won't trust us.

345
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,600
What will we do with the milk?

346
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,500
We'll deliver it
to the government dairy.

347
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:10,300
Today we'll take the milk.
But not from tomorrow.

348
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:13,160
What will we do tomorrow, then?
Set fire to the milk?

349
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,100
See, he confuses matters
straightaway.

350
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:19,400
Look, we are not here
to trade in milk.

351
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:23,500
That is the job of the coop
which is yet to be formed.

352
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:27,860
You did not say that. You said
you would give us a better price.

353
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,000
Yes or no?

354
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:33,600
Once an idea enters your head,
can it ever be removed?

355
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,800
Get on with that test.

356
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,200
Don't rush all
at the same time!

357
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:07,200
Hey, what's going on?
Let it go!

358
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:11,100
Don't you dare touch my buffalo!
Think it belongs to your father?

359
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:15,500
You don't repay your debts
and you hurl insults?

360
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:19,500
I said I'll settle it by next month.
Understand, you loony?

361
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,800
I'll complain to the Society.

362
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,800
Let them pay and collect
the buffallo.

363
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,900
What's the matter here?

364
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:36,000
He's taking my buffalo in revenge
for my joining the Society.

365
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:40,260
How will the poor woman manage?

366
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:42,900
The buffalo is her only means
by which to repay your loan.

367
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:44,360
Listen, sahib, don't interfere.

368
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,700
Then I'll go to Mishra.

369
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:08,400
Sir, no new members
since that first lot.

370
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,800
How long can we carry on?

371
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:15,200
Your guess is as good as mine.

372
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:21,500
Unless Bhola and headman pitch in,
we are stuck right here.

373
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,600
Then it's better to forget
this cooperative altogether.

374
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,600
The headman souldn't pose a problem.

375
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,900
He is a trader after all.

376
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:34,100
I'll work on him tomorrow.

377
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:38,900
Once the headman is with us
the village will follow.

378
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:42,400
It's more important for
Bhola and his caste to join.

379
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:12,800
At the milk centres,
all caste and creed will be erased.

380
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:18,960
People of all castes will stand
together in one queue

381
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,060
to hand in their collection of milk.

382
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:25,700
Accounts will be kept
by the Society members.

383
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:33,000
The milk centres will also sell
cattlefeed and fertilisers.

384
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:40,300
The earnings will go towards
welfare and medication of animals.

385
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:48,200
Nineteen mobile veterinary units at Anand,
four nearby villages,

386
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:53,000
on duty 24 hours for emergencies.

387
00:41:56,500 --> 00:42:02,600
Arrange artificial insemination
of animals in every village.

388
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:07,100
At places this experiment
has progressed rapidly.

389
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:10,600
At others, it is only a matter of time
for it to catch on.

390
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:18,000
The first Societies were formed
in Gujarat's Kheda district.

391
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:27,500
They merged to form a Federation
based at Anand.

392
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:31,600
The Society has its own vans,

393
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:39,000
and a dairy plant to store milk
and produce dairy products.

394
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:51,200
Milk is collected and taken
to the dairy at the Centre.

395
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:56,700
It is tested for fat content
and samples are graded.

396
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:01,000
The price is fixed accordingly.

397
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:05,900
Each Society settles it's accounts
at the end of the month.

398
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:12,000
Milk pours into various sections
of the plant.

399
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:19,700
The co-ops helped increase
Kheda's industrial potential

400
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:22,500
The question is:

401
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:25,300
can their success at Anand
be repeated elsewhere?

402
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:33,600
If the experiment works well
milk production will increase.

403
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:40,900
Well done.
It's almost a miracle.

404
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:46,900
Frakly, I thought you'd be unable
to handle this work.

405
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:49,200
But you've done it.

406
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:52,900
The Cooperative will flourish
only when you join in.

407
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:55,100
Please, become a member soon.

408
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,700
Welcome to our cooperative.

409
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:04,500
I was telling my friends just that
this morning.

410
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:08,000
We should work together
for the good of the village.

411
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:36,700
Now we need only
the Dalit community.

412
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:42,400
What have they to do
with the Society?

413
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:47,200
They blindly follow Bhola
and he is a trouble-maker?

414
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:56,900
I suspect he threw the stone
at our film screening last night.

415
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:08,000
Leave him to me.

416
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:30,200
Bindu, wait!

417
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,700
Where are you going?

418
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:45,300
Where has that buffalo bolted to?

419
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,100
I wanted to ask you something.

420
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,500
What's wrong with your buffalo?

421
00:46:55,540 --> 00:47:00,000
Nothing. He's pickly as a burr,
that's all.

422
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:03,500
How have we upset him
that he is so against us?

423
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:07,600
You have done nothing
but there's that city guy.

424
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:08,600
Who?

425
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:09,400
His father.

426
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:14,200
See that road?
His father was the contractor for it.

427
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:17,100
Bhola's mother
used to clean his house.

428
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:21,700
He made her pregnant and left.
That's why Bhola is the way he is.

429
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:22,900
I see.

430
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:28,100
Why don't you persuade him
to join the Society?

431
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:32,000
He's a tough one, sahib,
he listens to no one.

432
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:35,000
The Society will benefit a lot
if he joins.

433
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:40,500
Ask him and see.

434
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:44,900
If you tell me to, I will.

435
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,400
How does he get along
with the headman?

436
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:54,200
Not a bit.

437
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:56,400
Why?

438
00:47:56,440 --> 00:48:00,200
Bhola was getting some land,
right there.

439
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:22,900
What happened?

440
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:25,500
The headman interfered.

441
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,500
Why?

442
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:36,500
Bhola is my caste,
a Dalit.

443
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:57,200
Do you have children?

444
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:58,700
No.

445
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:03,600
Why? Aren't you married yet?

446
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:05,200
I am.

447
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:10,200
Is your wife beautiful?

448
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:16,900
Where is that buffalo!
Does she always behave like this?

449
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:22,000
She'll come, sahib.
You can go.

450
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:23,000
Semen for artificial insemination
is obtained from young bulls.

451
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:30,700
It is sealed in glass tubes
and kept on ice till it is used.

452
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:39,100
When the buffalo is on heat
the doctor inserts it into its anus

453
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:41,000
and deposits the semen
from the tube.

454
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:45,700
It is no use inseminating
an animal when it is not on heat.

455
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:51,800
The semen is of a pedigree bull
for producing more milk.

456
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:54,700
I don't see any Dalits here.

457
00:50:54,740 --> 00:50:58,300
You don't know?
Bhola is in jail.

458
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,200
What for?

459
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:04,900
They believe we caused his arrest.

460
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:12,200
He is a real hooligan, that one.

461
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:16,400
That bastard threw the stone
at your film screening.

462
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,100
I had him put in the lock-up.

463
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:22,900
Do you have proof?

464
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:25,800
Your man complained about it.

465
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:29,100
Which one?

466
00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:30,800
Deshmukh, sahib.

467
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:34,700
I was angry when he played
this mischief on you.

468
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:37,600
You are our guests.

469
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:44,700
He'll serve six months.
I wrote his report.

470
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:48,300
This is not good at all.

471
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:06,600
Did you complain
to the headman about Bhola?

472
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:07,700
No.

473
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:10,800
The headman says you did.

474
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:17,600
I did mention that Bhola
may have thrown that stone.

475
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:21,300
Do you know he is now in jail?

476
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:24,900
Now no Dalit will join us.

477
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:33,400
Where did you go?

478
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:35,700
To the city.

479
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:38,000
Some tea?

480
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:43,200
There is a letter for you.

481
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:45,100
Where is it?

482
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:10,400
Was there any gent work?

483
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:19,100
I had Bhola released from jail.

484
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:28,700
Shanta is coming here.

485
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:32,500
I will have to look for
another house.

486
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:03,100
You like this awful place so much
that now you don't want to leave?

487
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:08,900
Try to understand the people
who live here.

488
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:12,000
They have some
good qualities too.

489
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:16,000
You like them because they feel
you are an important man.

490
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:17,100
Nonsense.

491
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:18,500
They respect you.

492
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:22,700
If I could help it,
I would leave now.

493
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:25,700
I didn't force you to come here.

494
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:28,400
It's you who sent for me.

495
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:32,000
Yes, I did. Because your letters
were full of complaints

496
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:34,400
that you were lonely
and unhappy.

497
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:46,700
Does Shanta-Bhabhi like
living in the village?

498
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:49,800
She is adjusting to it.
But it will take time.

499
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:55,600
I'm not happy
about how things are going.

500
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:59,800
Only the well-to-do like the headman
have joined the Society.

501
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:03,800
We must get Bhola
and his lot also.

502
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:08,600
The problem is when Bhola joins
the headman may quit.

503
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:10,900
Why meddle in local politics?

504
00:58:10,940 --> 00:58:13,900
But what use is a Cooperative
without the have-nots?

505
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:16,200
Okay, but what's the hurry?

506
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:20,000
They will join
once they see the good in it.

507
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:25,700
From the start,
if only the rich become members

508
00:58:25,740 --> 00:58:29,100
the Dalits will decide that
the Society is not for them.

509
00:58:29,140 --> 00:58:31,800
They may even
be debarred from it.

510
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:35,100
You've made the Dalits
the main issue.

511
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:37,900
When forming the Cooperative itself
is the main issue.

512
00:58:37,940 --> 00:58:39,000
You are wrong!

513
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:43,500
Our primary objective is that
the poorest farmers should benefit.

514
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:48,000
In this village the Dalits
are the poorest community.

515
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:54,300
If your concern is only the Dalits,
why do you ask my opinion?

516
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:58,100
Ma

517
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:05,400
Bhola, why aren't you joining
the Society?

518
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:11,100
Without you, your entire caste
will keep away.

519
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:14,900
Your Society is only
for big people.

520
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:22,500
But it is the poor who should benefit
from the Cooperative.

521
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:29,400
Don't you want a better life
for your own people?

522
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:38,000
Do you want to
improve our lives, sahib?

523
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:42,300
What do you know of our lives?

524
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:49,600
That swine, Deshmukh complained
and I was put in the lock-up.

525
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:55,400
We are the lowest of the low.
Who cares for us?

526
01:00:56,400 --> 01:01:00,200
Our forefathers
were your slaves.

527
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:02,000
They cringed before you.

528
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:09,400
You spat on them.
And got free work out of them.

529
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:14,900
And you use our women as well.

530
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:21,300
Do you know what your man has done?
I'll show you.

531
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:27,700
Go inside and see!

532
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:32,800
What's happening here?

533
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:35,300
Your man is carrying on with her.

534
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:41,300
-One of us? Who?
-That guy with the red shirt.

535
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:47,860
She's hot for him. He said he'll
marry her and take her to the city.

536
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:50,300
They'll settle down there.

537
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:54,600
You city guys
are one of a kind.

538
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:58,200
Grab all you can,
then run away.

539
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:03,200
I know, sahib.
My mother also met such a one.

540
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:36,600
Get up. Pack your bags
and come with me.

541
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:39,900
Get ready.
You are out.

542
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:42,960
You are no longer required here,
understand?

543
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:43,860
What have I done, sir?

544
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:45,900
You know bloody well
what you've done.

545
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:49,200
I just come from
that girl's house.

546
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:53,760
Do you know how badly
her father has beaten her?

547
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:55,300
-Sir, I…
-Shut up!

548
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,600
Pack up and leave.

549
01:02:58,200 --> 01:02:59,900
-Now?
-Right now!

550
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:07,500
-Don't be so harsh…
-Don't interfere.

551
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:17,000
You look worried.

552
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:20,460
I have sent Chandavarkar away.

553
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:21,500
Why?

554
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:24,100
You won't understand.

555
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:37,000
He was having an affair
with a Dalit girl.

556
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,400
Why be so disgusted?

557
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:41,800
Chandavarkar?
Stooping so low?

558
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:44,500
I said you would not
understand.

559
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:54,400
Sahib, today's earnings.

560
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:05,200
Even lower than yesterday?

561
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:17,200
The milk must be adulterated.
Those rascals add water to it.

562
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:19,200
Sir, the Cooperative is to blame.

563
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:21,600
Our effort till now
has come to nothing.

564
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:26,900
You people don't know
the fundamentals of good business.

565
01:06:27,300 --> 01:06:31,200
Why blame others
for your own shortcomings?

566
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:36,000
We have to bear what
destiny has prepared for us.

567
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:46,400
It is useless to desire something
that is not for you, understand?

568
01:06:48,300 --> 01:06:51,600
Give me the sales for the Cooperative
if you have them.

569
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:55,400
Haven't you heard? Show me
the figures of the Cooperative!

570
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:56,600
They are there below.

571
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:59,500
Speak up and say so!
Am I to see it in a dream?

572
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:14,200
Have both Bhola and the headman
joined the Society?

573
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:15,200
Yes, sir.

574
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:26,100
Our competitors
are an inspired lot.

575
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:32,200
From today we too will put
our heart and soul into our work.

576
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:37,600
From tomorrow, we will pay more
for the milk we are buying.

577
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:40,900
How can we afford that?
Our business will topple.

578
01:07:41,900 --> 01:07:45,200
Idiot. Which is mightier,
your brain or a buffalo?

579
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:49,600
Those who are willing to lose a little
win a lot.

580
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:55,000
God helps those who show
patience and endurance.

581
01:07:55,040 --> 01:08:00,400
Hard work and patience
is the way to ultimate peace.

582
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:02,800
Tie this thought in a knot
and remember it.

583
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:21,760
Brothers and sisters, sell your milk
to the Ganganath Dairy.

584
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:24,700
Ganganath Dairy has increased
its buying price.

585
01:08:24,740 --> 01:08:29,100
Ganganath Dairy has started
a lottery for you.

586
01:08:30,599 --> 01:08:34,200
Try your luck!
Sell milk to Ganganath Dairy

587
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:38,200
and win a thousand rupees.

588
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:43,700
♪ In clothes
♪ white looks best

589
01:08:43,740 --> 01:08:50,100
♪ And in women
♪ the fair ones are best

590
01:08:52,700 --> 01:08:58,400
As soon as we joined the coop
that Mishra raised his price.

591
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:00,900
Now we are at disadvantage.

592
01:09:00,940 --> 01:09:04,800
These are ruses to break the Society.
Later he will lower his price.

593
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:09,300
Is that the only aim of a coop,
to establish a fair price?

594
01:09:09,340 --> 01:09:11,700
It can help you
in many ways.

595
01:09:11,740 --> 01:09:15,999
One coop built a road
from the village to the highway.

596
01:09:16,300 --> 01:09:19,860
Others have dug tube wells,
started schools…

597
01:09:19,900 --> 01:09:20,860
Schools.

598
01:09:20,900 --> 01:09:21,499
So can you.

599
01:09:21,539 --> 01:09:23,999
Will Mishra do
all this for you?

600
01:09:24,039 --> 01:09:25,600
Sahib, I understand.

601
01:09:27,099 --> 01:09:31,499
Proper care for your buffalo,
right cattle-feed, right breed…

602
01:09:31,539 --> 01:09:33,700
The Society will help
in all matters.

603
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:37,100
In all matters?

604
01:09:37,300 --> 01:09:41,500
Of course. Want to get married?
We'll arrange that too.

605
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:51,699
Wait, brothers. Sell milk
to the Ganganath Dairy.

606
01:09:51,739 --> 01:09:53,600
You'll get a better price.

607
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:58,600
The coop has no stake at this village.
It may close down any day.

608
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:09,100
You Mishra stooge!
I'll break your head.

609
01:10:09,140 --> 01:10:12,300
Go get milk some place else.
Don't come to our society.

610
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,700
Bhola, who is the man?

611
01:10:16,740 --> 01:10:17,700
He's Mishra's guy.

612
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:27,660
Yesterday also
the milk on the Mengni route turned sour.

613
01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:29,100
You should be more careful.

614
01:10:30,300 --> 01:10:36,360
The truck leaves on time.
Why does it reach late then?

615
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:39,300
It's your business to find out,
not mine.

616
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:56,100
Move. Move over to your own queue.

617
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:02,100
Move.

618
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:11,500
Move.

619
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:15,200
Didn't you hear?
Move!

620
01:11:23,700 --> 01:11:26,400
Why a separate queue?
How does it bother you?

621
01:11:27,900 --> 01:11:29,900
Don't reply.

622
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:34,500
Go to your own queue.

623
01:11:38,100 --> 01:11:40,900
Have you heard or
are you deaf? Go!

624
01:11:48,300 --> 01:11:52,900
When the bastards earn a few coins
it goes to their heads.

625
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:28,700
Who's there?

626
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:31,900
What happened?

627
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:35,000
Tne engine overheated.

628
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:36,760
How long have you been
sleeping here?

629
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:37,700
Ten minutes.

630
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:41,200
Don't you know that milk exposed
to sunlight will go bad?

631
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:44,000
Who opened the cans?

632
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:45,000
How should I know?

633
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:49,300
For days the milk on this route
has reached late.

634
01:12:49,340 --> 01:12:51,400
There have been complaints
about you.

635
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:55,800
Don't talk rot.
I don't want to drive your truck.

636
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:58,100
To hell with your truck
and your job.

637
01:12:58,140 --> 01:12:59,900
You come to work drunk!

638
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:02,900
You're fired.
Get your dues settled tomorrow.

639
01:13:02,940 --> 01:13:06,200
Mulla, drive the jeep.

640
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:17,800
Our nation's strength
is increasing…

641
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:23,200
Before the headman acts,
I must meet the doctor.

642
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:38,600
Dr Rao, he wants to talk to you.

643
01:13:42,100 --> 01:13:46,100
How is it getting along?
Happy with the cooperative?

644
01:13:46,140 --> 01:13:49,000
Sir, we want to talk
about the election.

645
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:55,500
The headman wants to make
the coop his own property,

646
01:13:55,540 --> 01:13:58,700
run it himself
and swallow its profits.

647
01:13:58,740 --> 01:14:00,800
Will you allow that?

648
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:03,700
I am not responsible
for what's happening.

649
01:14:03,740 --> 01:14:06,300
Sahib, you know what's going on.

650
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:09,900
__

651
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:13,100
__

652
01:14:14,300 --> 01:14:18,700
__

653
01:14:18,740 --> 01:14:20,400
__

654
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:25,000
All right. __

655
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:56,600
You must choose your candidate.
Then you know your strength.

656
01:14:57,700 --> 01:15:02,300
Strength? If we have a candidate,
the headman will take revenge.

657
01:15:02,900 --> 01:15:05,300
That's your business.

658
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:10,460
If you are scared of the higher castes,
why do you grumble?

659
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:13,200
Sir, the headman is powerful.

660
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:17,100
Stick together
and you will be a match for him.

661
01:15:17,300 --> 01:15:19,000
Sir, let the headman be chairman.

662
01:15:19,100 --> 01:15:22,300
No! We will fight in the elections.

663
01:15:22,900 --> 01:15:24,400
Let the headman do what he likes.

664
01:15:25,100 --> 01:15:27,900
Sir, you tell us who
should be our man.

665
01:15:27,940 --> 01:15:29,800
Sahib, you explain to Bhola.

666
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:35,000
The headman can't attack you.
You are outsiders but he'll finish us.

667
01:15:35,740 --> 01:15:40,400
Moti, you people asked for
our advice and we gave it.

668
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:43,400
Now do what you think best.

669
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:59,700
We'll fight our own battles.
We are not eunuchs.

670
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:08,100
It is not fair to favour
one party in this manner.

671
01:16:08,140 --> 01:16:12,600
It will only cause greater tensioin
between Bhola and the headman.

672
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:14,600
I see no harm.

673
01:16:15,300 --> 01:16:18,800
We must treat
both sides equally.

674
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,960
One has money and power,
the other nothing.

675
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:26,900
Treat both equally?
What do you mean?

676
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:46,500
Bindu will not meet you
anymore. Go!

677
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:51,000
Is she out? I have some work
concerning the Society.

678
01:16:56,500 --> 01:16:58,100
I am back.

679
01:16:58,140 --> 01:17:01,000
Now Bindu will not work
for any Society.

680
01:17:05,300 --> 01:17:06,800
Are you her husband?

681
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:12,400
Who else?
Do I look like her father?

682
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:13,900
Get out!

683
01:17:13,940 --> 01:17:18,000
If you follow my wife around
I'll beat your brains out!

684
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:21,600
Educated man,
and yet you chase our women?

685
01:17:21,640 --> 01:17:23,000
Bastard!
Street dog!

686
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:25,000
She's no better!

687
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:30,500
Look at her once more and
I'll smash your Society to bits!

688
01:17:43,300 --> 01:17:45,000
Shanta, are you asleep?

689
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:58,500
Why do you mix so much with Dalits?
They are beneath us, it's degrading.

690
01:17:58,540 --> 01:18:00,300
Who told you all this?

691
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:07,600
These walls. Who else
am I to talk to in this desert?

692
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:16,900
You see, you don't understand
my responsibilities or my helplessness.

693
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:20,000
Yes, I don't understand anything.

694
01:18:21,100 --> 01:18:27,300
I am just a useless peasant,
worse than these Dalits you love.

695
01:18:30,900 --> 01:18:34,100
What do you expect?
Am I to rot here till I go mad?

696
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:42,200
Don't touch me!

697
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
I hate you.

698
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:51,600
Bitch, do you think I don't know why
you won't let me touch you?

699
01:19:53,700 --> 01:19:55,600
Hot for your lover?

700
01:19:55,640 --> 01:19:59,800
He comes sniffing
and you're ready, you slut!

701
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:05,000
Stay there!

702
01:20:12,900 --> 01:20:17,700
I swear by my son.
Touch me again and I'll jump into the well.

703
01:20:17,740 --> 01:20:22,200
Go, jump. I'll throw in two handfuls of mud
to help bury you.

704
01:20:22,240 --> 01:20:26,700
You run! You go to the doctor
and blacken my face?

705
01:20:26,740 --> 01:20:30,800
Wait and see what I do to you.
You won't escape.

706
01:21:53,900 --> 01:21:58,160
When you marry, you dream
you will be a queen in your home.

707
01:21:58,200 --> 01:22:00,700
But who knows the future?

708
01:22:25,100 --> 01:22:28,800
Members have understood
the advantages of the coop.

709
01:22:28,840 --> 01:22:32,300
Everything depends on
Bhola and the headman.

710
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:37,200
It will all be ruined
if the elections turn communal.

711
01:22:37,240 --> 01:22:40,100
We shouldn't interfere
in local politics.

712
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:44,600
The issues will resolve
in their own time.

713
01:22:47,100 --> 01:22:48,400
Come inside!

714
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:50,500
Bindu is here.

715
01:22:50,540 --> 01:22:52,000
Bindu? How are you?

716
01:22:52,040 --> 01:22:54,100
Her buffalo is dead.

717
01:22:54,140 --> 01:22:56,800
She wants a loan from the Society
to buy another.

718
01:22:56,840 --> 01:23:00,300
We'll see at the meeting tomorrow.

719
01:23:00,340 --> 01:23:03,000
Mark my words, doctor.
The headman won't allow it.

720
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:11,200
Then it must wait
till the elctions are over.

721
01:23:11,240 --> 01:23:14,200
Till then, what will she do?
Starve?

722
01:23:20,300 --> 01:23:23,200
Bindu, take this.

723
01:23:29,100 --> 01:23:30,500
What's come over her?

724
01:23:34,300 --> 01:23:36,700
Bhola, you give it to her.

725
01:23:47,900 --> 01:23:49,000
Take it.

726
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:51,400
Did I go with you to beg?

727
01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:53,200
Then why do you ask me
to take you?

728
01:23:53,240 --> 01:23:57,200
If I explained my situation
he'd know and share my sorrow.

729
01:23:57,240 --> 01:23:59,300
But he's like everyone else.

730
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:03,200
Take it.
You'll need it.

731
01:24:37,400 --> 01:24:38,700
Shall we start?

732
01:24:41,200 --> 01:24:42,800
Quiet!

733
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:50,400
There is only one nominee
for chairman, the headman.

734
01:24:50,440 --> 01:24:53,900
If no oher name is submitted,
he will be elected.

735
01:24:54,140 --> 01:24:57,200
Our man will also stand.
Take down Moti's name.

736
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:01,900
No. I won't go against him.

737
01:25:01,940 --> 01:25:03,200
What do you lose?

738
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:08,600
There's nothing to worry about.

739
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:11,600
We will do as Bhola says.

740
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:16,400
All Dalits must vote
for their man.

741
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:20,800
Your vote should be guided
by his honesty, not his caste.

742
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:26,660
If the Dalits
vote for their man

743
01:25:26,700 --> 01:25:31,360
we will force the village
to back the headman.

744
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:33,700
Whoever defies the headman
better watch out.

745
01:25:35,300 --> 01:25:36,900
What are you people doing?

746
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:40,100
Your caste differences will
only get worse!

747
01:25:40,140 --> 01:25:43,800
These high-caste people
will not support us, you'll see.

748
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:45,700
They'll hoodwink the Society and run.

749
01:25:45,740 --> 01:25:51,200
I won't hear this kind of talk!
The Society has not caste or creed.

750
01:25:54,500 --> 01:26:00,300
The Society is meant to benefit
any farmer of any caste.

751
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:01,800
Isn't that so?

752
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:11,300
Your yardstick is the same
for humans and these animals?

753
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:14,200
Animals? You call us "animals"?

754
01:26:14,240 --> 01:26:18,200
If we weren't part of this Society
I'd tear your tongue out!

755
01:26:19,900 --> 01:26:21,300
Sit down!

756
01:26:22,500 --> 01:26:25,800
Why are you squabbing
like children?

757
01:26:30,500 --> 01:26:32,200
Go home, all of you!

758
01:26:33,900 --> 01:26:36,000
An election cannot be held
under such conditions.

759
01:26:41,700 --> 01:26:44,400
Cool your tempers
and then we'll talk.

760
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:48,800
Let's go!

761
01:27:29,300 --> 01:27:32,000
♩ I languiish
♩ waiting to see you

762
01:27:32,040 --> 01:27:36,500
♩ I cannot endure the day or night
♩ To whom shall my heart cry out?

763
01:27:36,540 --> 01:27:42,700
♩ I am so weary

764
01:27:42,740 --> 01:27:45,800
♩ I no longer go
♩ to milk the cow

765
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:47,800
♩ I no longer go
♩ the well for water

766
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:50,100
♩ I know neither peace
♩ nor rest

767
01:27:50,140 --> 01:27:55,500
♩ Don't forget to come to my house

768
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:03,100
Have you no sense
upsetting the headman?

769
01:28:03,140 --> 01:28:07,800
Who asked you to join the Society?
You knew there would be a fight.

770
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:11,700
The headman kicks us about
as he likes and we submit to it.

771
01:28:11,740 --> 01:28:13,200
So you will fight him?

772
01:28:13,240 --> 01:28:14,100
We will!

773
01:28:14,140 --> 01:28:16,000
Have we the strengh?

774
01:28:19,300 --> 01:28:22,200
We cannot think of
overreaching ourselves.

775
01:28:22,240 --> 01:28:24,100
You will never learn
anything in your life.

776
01:28:24,140 --> 01:28:28,800
Like your forefathers, you lick their
feet and kowtow to the headman.

777
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:41,800
I think it's typhoid.

778
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:47,000
I would suggest you take her into town
for it's so much easier to look after her there.

779
01:28:56,500 --> 01:28:58,300
Thank you very much, doctor.

780
01:29:17,100 --> 01:29:23,500
Brothers, I am no stranger
to this village.

781
01:29:25,400 --> 01:29:30,200
For the last 20 years
I have been serving you people.

782
01:29:31,100 --> 01:29:36,900
My efforts were rewarded,
as you know.

783
01:29:38,600 --> 01:29:43,800
Two years ago our village Court
won the District prize.

784
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:52,500
Also the Society
was established here on my say-so.

785
01:29:54,400 --> 01:30:01,400
As headman I have snouldered
the burden of this village.

786
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:09,700
Every individual must be aware
of his position and abilities.

787
01:30:09,740 --> 01:30:15,800
All should know their place.
Only this can ensure discipline.

788
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:20,400
Then we can live together
happily and peacefully.

789
01:30:23,140 --> 01:30:25,600
Now, vote for your headman
as chaiirman.

790
01:30:27,300 --> 01:30:30,100
By voting for him,
what will you gain?

791
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:36,400
Suppose Moti is chairman.
Will he help only his own caste?

792
01:30:36,440 --> 01:30:41,600
Get it into your thick skulls
that we poor people together

793
01:30:41,640 --> 01:30:45,100
can run the Society
for the benefit of all.

794
01:30:46,100 --> 01:30:49,300
Your well-being is
our well-being.

795
01:30:49,340 --> 01:30:53,500
Moti, our Moti,
is a poor man like the rest of us.

796
01:30:53,540 --> 01:30:56,300
He will think of everyone's good.
Vote for him.

797
01:30:56,340 --> 01:30:59,700
The headman will swallow up
your Society.

798
01:30:59,740 --> 01:31:01,500
Am I lying?

799
01:31:03,200 --> 01:31:08,200
Last year, the village bought seeds
which he used on his fields.

800
01:31:09,300 --> 01:31:13,600
For the school, his brother-in-law
got the contract.

801
01:31:15,300 --> 01:31:18,000
Think. Will such a man
help you and me?

802
01:31:18,040 --> 01:31:19,200
No way.

803
01:31:20,300 --> 01:31:25,300
This monkeying with us
is just to impress the District Board.

804
01:31:25,340 --> 01:31:27,300
What other aim would he have?

805
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:32,900
Think before you vote.

806
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:40,200
I hear your men clashed
with some Dalits yesterday.

807
01:31:40,240 --> 01:31:46,100
Really? I haven't heard amy
such thing.

808
01:31:46,140 --> 01:31:49,100
It doesn't matter
whether you heard it or not.

809
01:31:49,700 --> 01:31:53,300
All this infighting
will harm the society.

810
01:31:54,500 --> 01:31:59,000
In that case
better tick off that Bhola.

811
01:32:09,300 --> 01:32:16,300
Bhola, this bickering
must stop

812
01:32:16,340 --> 01:32:18,900
or the Society will break.

813
01:32:18,940 --> 01:32:19,900
Don't I know that?

814
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:26,300
All this trouble has been hatched
by that swine, the headman.

815
01:32:26,340 --> 01:32:29,500
Let him do as he pleases.
Are you not responsible too?

816
01:32:47,200 --> 01:32:48,760
♩ I languiish
♩ waiting to see you

817
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:53,700
♩ I cannot endure the day or night
♩ To whom shall my heart cry out?

818
01:32:53,740 --> 01:33:00,200
♩ I am so weary

01:33:00,240 --> 01:33:02,800
♩ I no longer go

♩ I no longer go

821
01:33:05,040 --> 01:33:07,500
♩ I know neither peace

01:33:07,540 --> 01:33:12,500
♩ Don't forget to come to my house

823
01:34:09,700 --> 01:34:13,600
The headman and Moti have
an equal number of votes.

824
01:34:19,800 --> 01:34:26,000
According to our rules, we will
write both names and pick out one.

825
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,700
Mulla, bring the papers.

826
01:34:29,740 --> 01:34:31,800
Atul, bring a child here.

827
01:34:55,100 --> 01:34:57,400
Son, pick one slip of paper.

828
01:35:03,200 --> 01:35:08,900
The new chairman
of the coop of the village is

829
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:10,200
Moti.

830
01:35:33,300 --> 01:35:37,660
Doctor, this cannot be.
This simply cannot be permitted.

831
01:35:37,700 --> 01:35:40,700
I have never lost an election
in my whole life.

832
01:35:40,740 --> 01:35:44,000
You have ruined
my reputation.

833
01:35:45,700 --> 01:35:48,200
You don't know me,
doctor.

834
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:52,500
Many leaders come here
to canvas for my elections.

835
01:35:52,900 --> 01:35:57,100
And for this bogus Society
you have cut my nose.

836
01:35:59,700 --> 01:36:03,160
But in a village,
it's the village Council that's supreme.

837
01:36:03,200 --> 01:36:05,600
Now, your Society cannot
take that over.

838
01:36:07,500 --> 01:36:12,000
Arrange the draw again
and this time I must win.

839
01:36:12,900 --> 01:36:15,000
That's against the law.

840
01:36:15,040 --> 01:36:18,500
The law? What law!
To hell with it!

841
01:36:22,200 --> 01:36:27,200
Just announce once
that I have won.

842
01:36:27,240 --> 01:36:30,200
Then I will
voluntarily resign.

843
01:36:30,240 --> 01:36:32,400
I can't do it.

844
01:36:38,500 --> 01:36:44,100
You should have warned me
of such malpractices.

845
01:36:44,140 --> 01:36:47,500
I wouldn't have
contested then.

846
01:36:47,540 --> 01:36:50,900
You have ruined
the name of my village.

847
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:57,700
Your hanky-panky
won't work here anymore.

848
01:37:39,300 --> 01:37:41,200
Who is it?
Bildu?

849
01:37:42,300 --> 01:37:50,500
Come, Bildu, dear.
Sit down.

850
01:37:50,540 --> 01:37:53,400
Sit on the chair.

851
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:17,400
I heard that you've been
in a bad way lately.

852
01:38:17,440 --> 01:38:21,800
Your husband left you,
your buffalo died…

853
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:23,760
Why didn't you tell us?

854
01:38:23,800 --> 01:38:27,900
You know how concerned I am
about you people.

855
01:38:28,300 --> 01:38:31,600
It is my duty to help you.

856
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:34,700
When will I get the buffalo?

857
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:39,160
There's no delay on my part.
Take it from the stable right now.

858
01:38:39,500 --> 01:38:46,000
I've the receipt ready.
Your thumbprint and the cow is yours.

859
01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:48,800
At what rate of interest?

860
01:38:50,100 --> 01:38:52,300
What kind of talk is this?

861
01:38:52,400 --> 01:38:54,600
What kind of rascals
want to charge interest?

862
01:38:54,800 --> 01:38:56,560
Place your thumb here.

863
01:38:56,600 --> 01:38:58,810
But remember, dear,

864
01:38:58,850 --> 01:39:04,100
you must not retract
what is stated on this paper.

865
01:39:05,800 --> 01:39:07,160
What's written there?

866
01:39:07,200 --> 01:39:10,600
You silly, there's nothing in
to harm you.

867
01:39:10,700 --> 01:39:13,100
Have anyone read it to you
if you like.

868
01:39:14,200 --> 01:39:17,400
She'll agree, Mr Mishra.
Don't worry.

869
01:39:26,600 --> 01:39:28,500
Your thumb, dear.

870
01:39:36,500 --> 01:39:38,200
Here you are, Mr lawyer.

871
01:39:40,600 --> 01:39:44,400
I hope she won't change
her mind later.

872
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:49,200
Sir, leave that to me.

873
01:40:07,100 --> 01:40:11,600
If he reaches Mengni village
an hour earlier.

874
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:14,560
-We can't do that.
-Why not?

875
01:40:14,600 --> 01:40:16,200
We'd have to employ
 __ on deliveries.

876
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,500
May I speak to you in private
for a minute?

877
01:40:23,900 --> 01:40:24,900
Excuse me.

878
01:40:27,700 --> 01:40:33,100
The cost of an extra deliver is high,
our income won't cover it.

879
01:40:37,900 --> 01:40:41,960
Doctor Rao, here it is.
Take your time and read it. No hurry.

880
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:44,900
My client has accused you
of rape.

881
01:40:44,940 --> 01:40:46,600
What? Rubbish!

882
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:49,500
She is from the village.
Her name is Bindu.

883
01:40:55,800 --> 01:40:57,300
Read it yourself.

884
01:41:00,200 --> 01:41:01,960
All this is a lie!

885
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:07,300
I wouldn't know. But you will be prosecuted.
Everyone will hear of it.

886
01:41:07,340 --> 01:41:11,500
Then why throw mud on me here?
Why not at court?

887
01:41:11,540 --> 01:41:14,560
Don't discharge your anger on me,
it's not me who's sueing you.

888
01:41:14,600 --> 01:41:18,000
I am merely the lawyer.
I respect you.

889
01:41:18,040 --> 01:41:19,200
Please, go away.

890
01:41:20,500 --> 01:41:24,900
I presented this in case
you want to start counter proceedings.

891
01:41:33,400 --> 01:41:37,000
What's the matter?
Why did he come?

892
01:41:39,300 --> 01:41:41,600
It's nothing important.

893
01:41:44,100 --> 01:41:48,100
So we will employ another driver
and from Mengni we will take the road…

894
01:41:48,200 --> 01:41:49,500
I'm going home.

895
01:42:02,900 --> 01:42:05,800
♩ I languiish
♩ waiting to see you

896
01:42:05,840 --> 01:42:09,400
♩ I cannot endure the day or night
♩ To whom shall my heart cry out?

897
01:42:09,440 --> 01:42:13,500
♩ I am so weary

898
01:42:13,540 --> 01:42:18,300
♩ I am so weary

899
01:42:43,900 --> 01:42:45,100
Come, sir.

900
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
Is everything all right?

901
01:45:49,400 --> 01:45:51,000
Doctor Rao!

902
01:46:04,600 --> 01:46:06,500
Come, quickly,
doctor Rao.

903
01:46:07,200 --> 01:46:09,300
The entire Dalit village
has been set on fire.

904
01:46:09,900 --> 01:46:12,000
-Who did it?
-The headman's people.

905
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,400
Shanta, go to sleep now.

906
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:27,300
Please, Shanta.

907
01:46:29,800 --> 01:46:32,900
Anasuya, sit near Shanta.

908
01:47:53,700 --> 01:47:55,400
You took time to come.

909
01:47:55,440 --> 01:47:56,800
What's the news?

910
01:47:57,300 --> 01:47:58,800
Not good.

911
01:47:59,900 --> 01:48:03,600
Everyone except the Dalits
have been released on bail.

912
01:48:04,900 --> 01:48:06,260
You are right.

913
01:48:06,300 --> 01:48:11,960
But these people
must be in jail for a few days.

914
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,060
Otherwise the tension
will mount.

915
01:48:14,100 --> 01:48:15,600
The tension is due
only to them?

916
01:48:16,900 --> 01:48:18,960
I've given my opinion.

917
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:22,900
If you insist, why don't you meet
the Judicial Magistrate?

918
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,300
How do you know the Dalits
are at fault?

919
01:48:25,500 --> 01:48:29,500
Any trouble
and they are to blame.

920
01:49:22,800 --> 01:49:24,300
Here, take this, sister.

921
01:49:30,800 --> 01:49:32,000
A great pity.

922
01:49:41,300 --> 01:49:46,000
Is the inspector there?
Please, call him.

923
01:49:55,500 --> 01:50:02,000
Sir, I have a request.
Those Dalits in jail,

924
01:50:03,400 --> 01:50:05,400
I am willing
to offer bail for them.

925
01:50:13,200 --> 01:50:17,300
Come down.
Go and sit inside.

926
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,200
Why have we been
brought here?

927
01:50:23,240 --> 01:50:26,100
Mr Mishra wants
to welcome us.

928
01:50:26,140 --> 01:50:28,560
The swine. He thinks he can buy us
because he bailed us out!

929
01:50:28,600 --> 01:50:30,900
Try and understand
how seious the situation is.

930
01:50:54,900 --> 01:50:58,600
Sit down, all of you.

931
01:50:59,700 --> 01:51:02,200
Don't feel shy.

932
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:23,800
Moti, get up.
Why are you sitting here?

933
01:51:23,840 --> 01:51:26,200
Sit there, on the chair.

934
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:31,500
Bhola, come here.
Please, come.

935
01:51:35,100 --> 01:51:37,800
Never mind.
Sit down.

936
01:51:47,200 --> 01:51:50,700
My dear brothers and sisters,

937
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:55,700
you may have forgotten our old ties
but I have not.

938
01:51:55,740 --> 01:52:00,700
A true friend always helps
in time of need.

939
01:52:07,400 --> 01:52:16,200
My heart is full
seeing your misfortune and pain.

940
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:24,700
Make it stop crying.

941
01:52:28,900 --> 01:52:34,900
My heart goes out to you
in your pain.

942
01:52:37,700 --> 01:52:41,900
It is my duty to share
your sorrow.

943
01:52:47,200 --> 01:52:52,700
Give the names of people
whose huts were burnt down.

944
01:52:52,740 --> 01:52:55,800
We will do all we can
to help them.

945
01:52:58,400 --> 01:53:02,800
All of you came under the influence
of these city people.

946
01:53:02,840 --> 01:53:08,800
But never mind.
Children do make mistakes.

947
01:53:08,840 --> 01:53:15,000
We elders
must overlook your lapses.

948
01:53:15,900 --> 01:53:19,460
Now you will be able to gauge
the genuine person from the false.

949
01:53:19,500 --> 01:53:22,300
They are as different
as milk and water.

950
01:53:22,340 --> 01:53:25,000
Are we here to listen
to his rubbish?

951
01:53:25,040 --> 01:53:27,900
He'll give money now
to keep us in his grip!

952
01:53:27,940 --> 01:53:36,200
Bhola, what are you saying?
Cool down. Be patient.

953
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:41,900
Anger is bad for your health.
I say this for your own good.

954
01:53:41,940 --> 01:53:47,800
You have my trust
as we are friends over the years.

955
01:53:47,840 --> 01:53:52,000
All this won't work! I tell you.
He will destroy the Society!

956
01:53:52,900 --> 01:53:57,500
What did the Society do for us?
It's Mr Mishra who released us.

957
01:53:58,400 --> 01:54:01,200
What's wrong with taking loans?

958
01:54:03,700 --> 01:54:07,300
You'll have a loan from him again?

959
01:54:09,200 --> 01:54:12,800
Taking it you'll break down
all we have built.

960
01:54:14,900 --> 01:54:21,500
The Society is ours.
We have created it.

961
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:28,000
We got rid of the headman.
Now you want this bastard to fix you?

962
01:54:30,400 --> 01:54:33,900
It was partly our fault.
We admit it.

963
01:54:34,500 --> 01:54:39,900
But we wanted to join hands
to create something new.

964
01:54:39,940 --> 01:54:43,500
Won't this go into
your heads?

965
01:54:49,800 --> 01:54:56,100
Brothers, so our Bhola has gone off his mind.
He is mad.

966
01:55:00,500 --> 01:55:03,600
Come back soon.
Otherwise there will be chaos.

967
01:55:08,500 --> 01:55:12,100
I'll be back with orders
for Doctor's removal.

968
01:55:12,140 --> 01:55:15,200
He's getting to be too much.

969
01:55:33,400 --> 01:55:34,900
They have released you?

970
01:55:35,900 --> 01:55:38,100
They have released everyone.

971
01:55:38,700 --> 01:55:40,500
No need to worry.

972
01:55:44,600 --> 01:55:47,000
Do you know what's happening
to the Society?

973
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:51,500
So? What are you doing about it?

974
01:55:51,540 --> 01:55:56,100
What am I to do?
The rest have abandoned it.

975
01:55:56,900 --> 01:55:59,500
Looks as if
I am the only one now.

976
01:56:00,200 --> 01:56:04,100
All the others seem to
have lost their senses.

977
01:56:06,300 --> 01:56:08,400
Work is always thwarted
in the beginning.

978
01:56:09,400 --> 01:56:12,400
At such times,
it's best to be low.

979
01:56:13,200 --> 01:56:16,900
You mean we sit with folded arms
and do nothing?

980
01:56:17,300 --> 01:56:18,400
For a while.

981
01:56:20,600 --> 01:56:22,300
I don't think I agree with you.

982
01:56:22,340 --> 01:56:24,100
But who will listen to us?

983
01:56:25,200 --> 01:56:33,200
When you came here you talked big
about doing things
and creating something new.

984
01:56:33,240 --> 01:56:36,700
You have conceded failure so soon?

985
01:56:36,740 --> 01:56:42,100
But I won't let it happen.
All of you can give up but I won't!

986
01:56:42,140 --> 01:56:44,100
Do what you like.

987
01:56:44,900 --> 01:56:47,900
Your personal quarrels have split
the village in two.

988
01:56:48,900 --> 01:56:50,800
Now bear the consequences.

989
01:56:57,400 --> 01:57:04,700
Doctor sahib, think about it.

990
01:57:07,500 --> 01:57:09,000
I'll be back.

991
01:57:28,500 --> 01:57:31,900
-What is it?
-I want to see Dr Rao.

992
01:57:31,940 --> 01:57:34,600
Come in.
He should be here soon.

993
01:57:48,400 --> 01:57:50,300
I don't wish to talk to you.

994
01:57:50,200 --> 01:57:54,300
You musn't be angry with me.
Please, hear me out.

995
01:57:56,100 --> 01:57:58,000
You'll benefit from it.

996
01:57:59,800 --> 01:58:03,700
I've said I don't want
to talk to you.

997
01:58:03,740 --> 01:58:05,000
Please, go away.

998
01:58:05,040 --> 01:58:06,800
I have some
important information.

999
01:58:09,300 --> 01:58:11,100
What is it?

1000
01:58:12,200 --> 01:58:14,400
In private, please.

1001
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:32,600
You know this story has been
concocted to blackmail me.

1002
01:58:32,640 --> 01:58:38,500
That's why I got a third party
to pressure Bindu to retract it.

1003
01:58:38,540 --> 01:58:41,100
She has agreed to do so.

1004
01:58:42,900 --> 01:58:44,600
Who is that party?

1005
01:58:46,400 --> 01:58:50,900
Ganga Prasad Mishra,
the proprietor of Ganganath Dairy.

1006
01:58:53,100 --> 01:58:59,900
So this is all his doing.
I should have known.

1007
01:59:00,900 --> 01:59:06,800
Moreover, he will compensate you
for your mental agony.

1008
01:59:32,600 --> 01:59:34,700
Get out of here!

1009
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:37,500
The bastard!

1010
01:59:38,500 --> 01:59:40,900
He thinks he can kick me around
as he likes.

1011
01:59:41,900 --> 01:59:43,900
I'll show him.

1012
01:59:44,900 --> 01:59:48,200
Let's see what this fool
of Mishra can do.

1013
01:59:49,100 --> 01:59:52,000
He thinks he can get away
with whatever he wants.

1014
01:59:52,700 --> 01:59:56,300
I'll break that bloody swine
if it's the last thing I do.

1015
02:00:02,600 --> 02:00:06,900
This Cooperative will run.
You wait and see.

1016
02:00:36,400 --> 02:00:37,800
Sir, telegram for you.

1017
02:01:36,500 --> 02:01:38,700
Good news for you, Shanta.

1018
02:01:41,700 --> 02:01:45,500
Orders from Head Office.

1019
02:01:47,200 --> 02:01:50,500
We are going back home.

1020
02:02:24,600 --> 02:02:29,000
We are leaving this village today.
I came to say goddbye.

1021
02:02:28,400 --> 02:02:31,800
Bindu is not here.
She has gone away.

1022
02:02:36,400 --> 02:02:40,200
Hell of a big shot.
Coming here asking after Bindu.

1023
02:03:04,200 --> 02:03:07,200
♩ I languiish
♩ waiting to see you

1024
02:03:07,240 --> 02:03:13,400
♩ I cannot endure the day or night
♩ To whom shall my heart cry out?

1025
02:03:13,440 --> 02:03:20,600
♩ I am so weary

1026
02:03:20,640 --> 02:03:23,800
♩ I no longer go

1027
02:03:23,840 --> 02:03:26,600
♩ I no longer go

1028
02:03:26,640 --> 02:03:29,900
♩ I know neither peace
♩ nor rest

1029
02:03:29,940 --> 02:03:34,500

02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:45,600
♩ Since you have come to my village

1031
02:03:45,640 --> 02:03:55,100
♩ I am so lonely and so sad

02:04:21,140 --> 02:04:25,800
♩ Oh, foreigner

1037
02:05:45,800 --> 02:05:48,300
Hey you, why are you selling
milk here?

1038
02:05:48,340 --> 02:05:51,500
Why are you here?
This is not the Society office.

1039
02:05:51,540 --> 02:05:53,800
Go away from here.

1040
02:05:53,840 --> 02:05:56,100
Shut up, you oaf.
I'm not talking to you.

1041
02:05:57,600 --> 02:06:01,700
Okay, don't come.
But one day you all will.

1042
02:06:02,200 --> 02:06:05,300
You too?
Won't you understand?

1043
02:06:05,340 --> 02:06:08,500
Mishra gave you clothes
and you are happy with them?

1044
02:06:08,540 --> 02:06:12,400
Moti, you too?
What are you doing with these crooks?

1045
02:06:12,440 --> 02:06:15,900
Where else to go?
The society people have gone back.

1046
02:06:15,940 --> 02:06:18,600
You, the Society chairman,
talking like this?

1047
02:06:19,100 --> 02:06:21,800
Does the Society belong
to those bastards or to us?

1048
02:06:22,200 --> 02:06:24,100
Come. Let's go to the Society office.

1049
02:06:24,140 --> 02:06:26,200
Will we be able to run it?

1050
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:32,500
Why not? Together we can make it work.
Come on!

1051
02:07:00,500 --> 02:07:02,900
♩ My village on the river bank

1052
02:07:02,940 --> 02:07:07,000
