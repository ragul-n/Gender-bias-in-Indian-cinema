1
00:01:16,875 --> 00:01:18,750
KEEP YOUR EVIL EYES OFF ME

2
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:23,875
I have bought a big screen television.

3
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,416
Let's do it while watching the television.

4
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,750
I'm not coming to your house!

5
00:01:28,083 --> 00:01:29,375
That's not fair, Indoo.

6
00:01:30,083 --> 00:01:31,416
We've been dating for over a year now.

7
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,500
Well, everyone is breaking up
and we can't even "make up."

8
00:01:33,583 --> 00:01:34,666
But first, learn to speak English.

9
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,166
It's "make out" and not "make up".

10
00:01:36,666 --> 00:01:39,458
Well, I feel left out
because you don't let me in.

11
00:01:40,041 --> 00:01:42,458
You can have your way
once we get married.

12
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:49,250
Okay. Let's forget about making out.

13
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,041
How about just a kiss?

14
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:57,500
Stop!
The driver is looking at us.

15
00:02:00,458 --> 00:02:02,000
These drivers are scoundrels.

16
00:02:02,625 --> 00:02:04,666
You never know when
they might pull over and molest you.

17
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,416
Are you insane?
Hey, look ahead!

18
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:07,583
He won't do anything.

19
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:09,458
But let me do something.

20
00:02:09,791 --> 00:02:11,041
You always throw yourself at me!

21
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:13,166
But you won't come home
and ask my dad for my hand.

22
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:15,416
Indoo, my love,
marriage is a tedious process.

23
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:16,791
First, the parents meet each other.

24
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:20,458
Then we fix a date and time,
decide on a venue, print the invites.

25
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:22,708
And then, we'll consummate
our marriage. Until then…

26
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:27,416
Let's make a deal.

27
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:30,083
You give me what I want tonight,

28
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:32,500
and I'll meet your dad
first thing in the morning.

29
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,125
Okay?

30
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:35,625
Here you go.

31
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:37,916
Here's a spare key to my house.

32
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:40,166
I'll wait for you.

33
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:41,958
Please don't break my heart, Indoo.

34
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:48,791
We've reached the mall.
Get down and pay the driver.

35
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:51,000
Excuse me, ma'am!

36
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:54,333
I wasn't looking at you through
the mirror with a malicious intent.

37
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:57,166
Mr. Bachchan once said in a movie,
"No means no."

38
00:02:57,666 --> 00:03:01,000
So, I was just checking if
this guy was forcing himself on you.

39
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:01,916
Hey!

40
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,833
Ma'am, just like every Muslim
residing in India isn't a Pakistani,

41
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:07,125
every driver in the world isn't a rapist.

42
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:08,583
Do you understand?

43
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:10,916
Did you hear that?

44
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,916
He is guilty conscience.

45
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:23,625
<i>Hello! I'm Indira Gupta.</i>

46
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:25,333
{\an8}<i>I am also known as Indoo.</i>

47
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:29,916
{\an8}<i>I'm sure that you've</i>
<i>misunderstood me after what you just saw.</i>

48
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:32,916
<i>You must be thinking</i>
<i>that I'm a judgmental person.</i>

49
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:37,125
{\an8}<i>But believe me, you'll do the same</i>
<i>if you ever come across the kind of people</i>

50
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,291
{\an8}<i>I've been dealing with.</i>

51
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:41,375
<i>Well, I'm an attractive woman.</i>

52
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,041
{\an8}<i>Be it young boys from college</i>

53
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:44,833
<i>or middle-aged retired men in the colony,</i>

54
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:47,541
{\an8}<i>everyone waits to catch</i>
<i>a fleeting glimpse of me.</i>

55
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:50,416
{\an8}<i>No, I'm not lying.</i>

56
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:52,291
<i>You can check my profile on social media.</i>

57
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:57,166
<i>The only thing trending</i>
<i>in Ghaziabad is #IndooKiJawani.</i>

58
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:56,583
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>welcome to New Delhi.</i>

59
00:05:56,708 --> 00:06:01,125
<i>Passengers traveling</i>

ARRIVALS

63
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:25,333
Hello.

64
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:27,375
I just landed.

65
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:29,583
Have you sent a car for me?

66
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:31,625
Pardon me.

67
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:33,875
A black Scorpio?

68
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,291
Stop the car!

69
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:53,000
Hey!

70
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:54,833
-He isn't stopping!
-Stop!

71
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:56,583
-Hey, stop!
-Stop!

72
00:06:57,958 --> 00:06:59,541
-Stop the car.
-Pull over.

73
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:00,625
GHAZIABAD POLICE

74
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,916
Give me your license.

75
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,541
What seems to be the problem, sir?

76
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:10,125
Listen, this is not a racecourse.

77
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:13,791
You cannot exceed the speed limit here.

78
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:15,583
Forgive us, sir.
It won't happen again.

79
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:17,208
We'll see to that later.

80
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:18,916
Let me see your license for now.

81
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:20,250
You'll get a ticket.

82
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:23,750
I don't have my license.

83
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:25,708
Why don't you have it?

84
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:27,208
You're speeding away without a license!

85
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:28,875
You're going to lose your car, man.

86
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:29,958
Step out of the car!

87
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:31,458
-Come on, get out.
-Come on!

88
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:34,583
-Driving without a license!
-Step out of the vehicle!

89
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:42,791
Listen…

90
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:52,083
Zone three to West Control!

91
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:56,791
A black Scorpio,
license plate number DL-3C-BF-3915,

92
00:07:56,916 --> 00:08:01,125
is speeding towards Mohan Nagar, Ghaziabad
after gunning down a Sub-inspector!

93
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:04,958
I repeat, DL-3C-BF-3915.

94
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:13,833
We found the car, sir.

95
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:15,000
We have surrounded it.

96
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:16,166
Okay, sir.

97
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:20,958
Please give me a cigarette.

98
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:33,916
GODDESS KESARI TEMPLE

99
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:53,041
Sir, that's the car.

100
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:55,375
There has been no movement
in the past one hour.

101
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,375
We're assuming
they went inside that house.

102
00:08:57,458 --> 00:08:58,375
Fine.

103
00:08:58,791 --> 00:08:59,791
Let's move in.

104
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:49,125
<i>We would like to inform</i>
<i>our viewers that the police found</i>

105
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:52,000
<i>large quantities of explosives</i>
<i>in Patel Nagar, Ghaziabad.</i>

106
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:55,250
<i>They suspect that some</i>
<i>terrorists are hiding in the city.</i>

107
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:58,041
<i>UP police are on the lookout for</i>
<i>the suspects all across the city.</i>

108
00:09:58,125 --> 00:10:03,875
{\an8}<i>According to the sources,</i>
<i>a big terrorist attack is being planned.</i>

109
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,333
{\an8}<i>Neither police nor the CBI</i>
<i>has any information on the terrorists yet.</i>

110
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:10,583
{\an8}<i>Their search is on.</i>

111
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:12,333
Dad, please turn down the volume.

112
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:13,958
I can't concentrate.

113
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:16,083
I'm preparing for the
IIT entrance examination.

114
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:17,666
This is not a joke.

115
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:20,625
Unbelievable! Pakistanis have
once again infiltrated our country,

116
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:22,500
and he wants to go to IIT.

117
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:28,041
I think that we are wasting money
by sending him to an engineering college.

118
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:31,833
Let him join IIT if he wants to.

119
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,875
As if the faculty is waiting

120
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:39,583
to give him the red-carpet treatment.
Am I right?

121
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,666
I would've answered your question

122
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:43,791
if you weren't my mom's husband.

123
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:45,000
Really?

124
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:46,541
Ask him to keep quiet.

125
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:49,083
Let's assume that I am not her husband.

126
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:51,500
-Now, tell me. What will you do?
-Mind your own business!

127
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:52,458
What?

128
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:54,250
-Stop talking nonsense!
-Answer me.

129
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:55,750
-What did you want to say?
-Mom, ask him to shut up.

130
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:56,708
Tell me!

131
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:58,416
-You're the limit!
-Get out of here!

132
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,333
You two are constantly
at each other's throats!

133
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:02,208
-Why don't you make him understand?
-Keep quiet.

134
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:05,208
Bunty, go upstairs
and study in Indoo's room.

135
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:06,333
Go on.

136
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:09,375
God knows what she's up to
with her friend.

137
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:11,208
No, I'm not coming over.

138
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,916
What happened, Indoo?

139
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:18,083
I promise, I'll meet your parents
tomorrow morning.

140
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:19,666
And what if you don't?

141
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:22,958
Indoo…

142
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:25,166
I'm always true to my word.

143
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:27,000
If you come today,

144
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:29,833
I will definitely come tomorrow.

145
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:31,541
You and your promises!

146
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:33,666
I won't be fooled by you.

147
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:35,375
I know all your tricks.

148
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:39,000
You're dangling a carrot in front of me
only to attain your motive.

149
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:43,666
Listen, Indoo.

150
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:46,625
You hold no special treasure.

151
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:48,458
Everyone has the same goodies.

152
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:52,833
You should stop taking…
my loyalty for granted.

153
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:54,666
Why are you after me
if I am not special?

154
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,000
Go find someone else!
Go to hell!

155
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:58,333
Damn…

156
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:00,833
You go to hell!

157
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:02,750
Did you break up again?

158
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:05,583
He is more interested
in having sex than getting married!

159
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:07,166
It is not his fault.

160
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:09,583
He's a man.
That's how God has made him.

161
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:14,416
<i>This girl right here, exuding pure swag,</i>
<i>is my best friend, Sonal.</i>

162
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:18,708
<i>She's two years younger than the internet,</i>
<i>and yet her knowledge is unbound.</i>

163
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:20,833
<i>Sonal knows about everything.</i>

164
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,916
<i>I must say,</i>
<i>you guys are rather unlucky.</i>

165
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:25,875
<i>You are at the mercy of Google…</i>

166
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:28,958
<i>whereas I learn everything from Sonal</i>

167
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:30,291
<i>without even asking for it.</i>

168
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:32,875
But that's just too risky.

169
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,208
What if I have sex with him
and he refuses to marry me?

170
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:42,041
Indoo, you are still
shackled by social taboos.

171
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,083
This is 2020, my friend!

172
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:46,083
It's the era of social media.

173
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:51,541
Earlier, men used to mark their
territory after they got married.

174
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:52,916
And in today's world,

175
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,791
men mark their territory
first and then get married.

176
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:58,041
Did your boyfriend mark his territory?

177
00:12:58,166 --> 00:12:59,208
I wish!

178
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,541
Uday has got some problem.

179
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:02,708
Is he impotent?

180
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:03,791
I don't know.

181
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:05,958
Your guy seems to be quite forward.

182
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:08,208
You should take things
forward before he runs away.

183
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:11,958
Don't waste your time.

184
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,916
Cook up a nice excuse for your parents,

185
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:16,541
get ready and surprise that pervert.

186
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:18,500
Go on!

187
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:21,500
Okay, Sonal.

188
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:23,208
I'll go and get ready.

189
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:25,125
Listen!

190
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:27,958
Make sure you wear a matching set.

191
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:36,500
Please stop over there.

192
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:38,291
Yes, stop right here.

193
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:41,000
You need to calm down.

194
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:51,208
The lights are still on.
He must be awake.

195
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:53,291
Go and kindle his desires.

196
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,916
I'll get going. My shy guy will
be calling me any minute now.

197
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
-All the best.
-Thanks, Sonal.

198
00:13:58,416 --> 00:13:59,291
Go.

199
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:02,458
Let's go.

200
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:52,458
<i>You should always watch out for suspicious</i>
<i>activities in your surroundings.</i>

201
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:55,416
<i>If you come across any</i>
<i>suspicious person or object,</i>

202
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,458
<i>inform the police immediately.</i>

203
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:59,916
<i>Do not trust strangers.</i>

204
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:01,541
Surprise!

205
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:09,916
<i>You should never trust a stranger.</i>

206
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,625
<i>Your life is in your hands.</i>

207
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,416
{\an8}<i>And it's your decision.</i>

208
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:17,083
I thought it was you.

209
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:20,458
Alka, is that you?

210
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,500
<i>Shameless woman.</i>

211
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:53,125
<i>Can we sort this out later?</i>

212
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:55,291
<i>The least you can do</i>
<i>is apologize, you witch.</i>

213
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:57,041
<i>I made a mistake.</i>

214
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:59,458
<i>You deserved to be slapped.</i>

215
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:02,833
Please.

216
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:05,000
I don't want to make a scene here.

217
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:23,250
Oh, damn!

218
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:30,250
Bunty's sister is so hot.

219
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:32,708
You know, she's single these days.

220
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:34,458
-Are you serious?
-He's right.

221
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:36,791
My sister told me
that she just had a breakup.

222
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:38,125
That's good news!

223
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:39,166
Yes, bro.

224
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:41,041
She's gorgeous!

225
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:43,666
Bunty.

226
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:44,916
Hey, Bunty!

227
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:47,458
What are you doing with the ladies?

228
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:49,833
Come here and eat with us.

229
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:50,958
Mom.

230
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:52,458
-Yes?
-I'll be with my friends.

231
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:54,125
Alright. Don't forget to eat.

232
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,458
-Sure.
-Okay.

233
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:58,791
-Come here, Bunty.
-Kittu, how are you?

234
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,041
Are you prepared for the entrance exam?

235
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:03,375
That's the reason I have called you here.

236
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:06,166
Only you can help me get through.

237
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:08,666
-Of course, dude!
-Have some.

238
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:18,500
What about that…

239
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:20,541
Hey…

240
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:21,708
Indoo!

241
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:22,666
Listen.

242
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:26,166
It's…

243
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:28,083
it's been so long since we met.

244
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:29,791
-Hello, Uncle Ranjeet.
-Hello.

245
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:31,208
Hello, Uncle Pran.

246
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:32,541
Hello, Uncle Prem.

247
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:33,583
Hello, dear.

248
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:38,291
So… where have you
been working these days?

249
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:40,083
I've taken a break, Uncle.

250
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:42,000
I'm planning to join the airline industry.

251
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:43,833
Oh! Do you want to be a pilot?

252
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:45,166
No, an air hostess.

253
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,250
Air hostess?

254
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:48,000
But air hostesses wear skimpy--

255
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:51,166
I mean they have to
wear short skirts, right?

256
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,083
The skirts are this short.

257
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:55,666
I've worn shorter skirts in school.

258
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,791
No, my dear.

259
00:17:57,875 --> 00:17:59,708
-You were just a kid back then.
-Yes.

260
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:02,083
You are a young adult now.

261
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:04,291
-Dear--
-Indoo.

262
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,583
Can I have a word with you?

263
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:07,375
-Excuse me.
-My dear…

264
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:08,791
-Listen.
-Dear…

265
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:11,166
-What is it?
-What's up?

266
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:13,208
This is Kittu.

267
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:14,708
We go to the same classes.

268
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:17,375
I'm helping him clear the entrance exam.

269
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:18,916
I can see that.

270
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:22,000
He considers you as his idol.

271
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:23,541
Why?

272
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:25,500
Does he also want to be an air hostess?

273
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:27,166
Pilot.

274
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:29,458
I'll make you touch the skies.

275
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:34,333
You explore the skies with him.

276
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:36,416
I'll go and get myself a cold drink.

277
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:40,000
Forget about her.

278
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:42,791
-Can I have a soda?
-Yes, ma'am.

279
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:44,416
Drinking without me?

280
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,708
I'm going crazy, Sonal.

281
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:50,791
I feel like everyone in Ghaziabad,
except for my father and my brother,

282
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:52,500
wants to mark me as their territory!

283
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:01,166
Who is he?

284
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:03,833
Excuse me?

285
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:06,125
Can you please come here?

286
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:09,916
Indoo, meet Uday,

287
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:12,166
my boyfriend and my husband-to-be.

288
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:16,333
-Sonal, get me a soda on the rocks.
-Sure.

289
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:18,416
-Can I have a soda on the rocks?
-Sure, ma'am.

290
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:21,333
Thank you. Here you go.

291
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:26,583
Is that Uday?

292
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,208
Yes, that's him.

293
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:31,333
But didn't you say
he had some problem?

294
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:33,041
It doesn't look like he's got a problem.

295
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:36,416
He wasn't always like this.
This change was brought about last week.

296
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,708
Come on. Let's sit down and talk.

297
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:39,833
Go on.

298
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:44,625
When you caught Satish with Alka
at his place and told me what happened,

299
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,833
I have to admit that I was petrified!

300
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:50,375
I decided I wouldn't wait for Uday to ask.

301
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:54,041
I went straight home
and watched a couple of adult films.

302
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:56,833
And then on Sunday, when my parents
weren't at home,

303
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:58,500
I called Uday over.

304
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:03,625
I played some slow English songs
and asked him to do the deed.

305
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:09,541
And I have witnessed a lot of change
in our relationship after that day!

306
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:13,041
Now he treats me like I am his wife.

307
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:15,875
He has started treating me
like his personal property.

308
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:17,916
Just like our fathers treat our mothers.

309
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:19,958
Everything is sorted.

310
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,833
Uday is the one for me.

311
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:26,583
-Excuse me! Can I have another soda?
-Yes, ma'am.

312
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:29,583
So, you mean…

313
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:34,291
I wouldn't have faced this
if I'd had sex with Satish.

314
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:35,500
Right.

315
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:39,583
Excuse me?
Is this for that lady there?

316
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:40,708
Yes, sir.

317
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:42,708
I'll give it to her.

318
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:44,458
-Okay.
-Okay, thank you.

319
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:54,416
No matter what, there's no way
I can patch things up with Satish.

320
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:55,958
He's a scoundrel!

321
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,458
Who is asking you
to patch things up with him?

322
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:01,083
You can prepare
for the future instead.

323
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,583
What do you mean?

324
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:03,750
Hello, sis!

325
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:05,500
What do you want?

326
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:07,958
You ordered a drink, right?

327
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:11,000
-I thought I'll get it for you.
-Thank you.

328
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:14,166
I'm having some girl talk with my
friend here. So, you may leave.

329
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:15,833
Okay. Bye.

330
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:19,875
Who was that nutcase?

331
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:21,666
My brother's friend.
He's a pest.

332
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:22,708
Ignore him.

333
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:25,375
You were saying something
about being prepared.

334
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:27,416
It's not a big deal, girl.

335
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:29,666
The lights go off.

336
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:31,541
So, you can't see much.

337
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:33,375
It lasts for around 30 to 45 minutes.

338
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:36,125
The boy will first kiss you. Okay?

339
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:40,125
Then he'll feel you,
with a few kisses here and there.

340
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:43,708
This will go on for around
30 to 45 minutes, okay?

341
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,291
Amid all of this,
he will mark his territory.

342
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:50,041
He'll be exhausted after that
and he won't even be able to move.

343
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:53,500
And you'll be thinking
it wasn't that big a deal after all.

344
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,625
You were unnecessarily worried.

345
00:21:56,375 --> 00:22:00,833
Well, real life is nowhere near
to what is shown in adult films.

346
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:04,500
But I'd recommend that you
watch a couple of adult films

347
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:05,750
for your knowledge.

348
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:08,291
Do you have any adult films?

349
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:11,666
I'll bring them over to your place.

350
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:13,791
Perfect. Come over tomorrow.

351
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:16,291
My family is going to Delhi for a week

352
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:18,125
to finalize my brother's
admission and accommodation.

353
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:19,833
Perfect. I'll stay over.

354
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,125
We'll watch it together.

355
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,875
I'm so excited.
This is going to be fun.

356
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:26,583
Hello! Mic testing!

357
00:22:26,666 --> 00:22:27,708
Hello!

358
00:22:27,833 --> 00:22:29,416
Hello, ladies and men!

359
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,833
Men are always gentlemen!

360
00:22:32,166 --> 00:22:36,208
Today, on the occasion
of Parag and Alka's wedding,

361
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:40,208
I have arranged a special
surprise for all of you today.

362
00:22:41,125 --> 00:22:43,625
That's right! A special surprise!

363
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:48,833
She'll mesmerize everyone
with her performance.

364
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,166
And the special

365
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:55,416
surprise is…

366
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:58,458
Killer Suhani!

367
00:23:20,458 --> 00:23:21,666
<i>Make up!</i>

368
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:25,375
<i>What did you make me drink?</i>
<i>I'm going crazy</i>

369
00:23:25,583 --> 00:23:29,250
<i>It was surely spiked</i>
<i>For I am feeling dizzy</i>

370
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:32,750
<i>What did you make me drink?</i>
<i>I'm going crazy</i>

371
00:23:32,875 --> 00:23:36,791
<i>It was surely spiked</i>
<i>For I am feeling dizzy</i>

372
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:41,041
<i>I was so naive about all these things</i>

373
00:23:41,125 --> 00:23:44,500
<i>My heart is all set to commit a sin</i>

374
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:49,000
<i>Oh, my heart!</i>
<i>It hasn't slept a wink at night</i>

375
00:23:52,083 --> 00:23:56,375
<i>Oh, my heart!</i>
<i>It sets fire in the rain</i>

376
00:23:59,333 --> 00:24:03,708
<i>Oh, my heart!</i>
<i>It sets fire in the rain</i>

377
00:24:21,625 --> 00:24:24,916
<i>I'm in a good mood</i>
<i>I've shed my inhibitions as well</i>

378
00:24:25,041 --> 00:24:28,916
<i>My face has a new glow for you</i>

379
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:34,166
<i>I've managed to convince my mother</i>

380
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:36,083
<i>I've managed to hide it from my father</i>

381
00:24:36,166 --> 00:24:39,791
<i>Just don't spill any liquor on my dress</i>

382
00:24:39,875 --> 00:24:43,750
<i>Listen up, you crazy enchanting girl</i>

383
00:24:43,875 --> 00:24:47,333
<i>Listen up, you crazy enchanting girl</i>

384
00:24:47,458 --> 00:24:51,916
<i>Oh, my heart!</i>
<i>I won't let you go home tonight</i>

385
00:24:54,625 --> 00:24:59,000
<i>Oh, my heart!</i>
<i>It sets fire in the rain</i>

386
00:25:02,166 --> 00:25:06,833
<i>Oh, my heart!</i>
<i>It sets fire in the rain</i>

387
00:25:34,291 --> 00:25:36,791
Your girl looks hungover.

388
00:25:36,875 --> 00:25:39,583
You were the one who got her drunk.

389
00:25:39,833 --> 00:25:42,250
You should also be
the cure for her hangover.

390
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,833
Please stay in, my dear.

391
00:25:50,291 --> 00:25:52,125
I feel that even I will
have to stay indoors

392
00:25:52,208 --> 00:25:54,000
given the antics you pulled
at the wedding yesterday.

393
00:25:54,083 --> 00:25:55,416
It's only a matter of one week.

394
00:25:55,625 --> 00:25:57,541
Please don't do anything stupid.

395
00:25:57,666 --> 00:25:59,875
I'll be back as soon as
your brother's admission is done.

396
00:26:00,916 --> 00:26:03,125
Why did we have to go today?

397
00:26:03,833 --> 00:26:07,166
Mr. Duggal has organized
a grand prayer meet in the colony!

398
00:26:08,666 --> 00:26:10,291
Why can't you enroll
in some other college?

399
00:26:10,375 --> 00:26:12,500
You can stay back.
I'll take care of his admission.

400
00:26:12,583 --> 00:26:16,500
Really? If I leave the two of you alone,
only one of you will come back home.

401
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,958
You need to decide whose
side you are on, Mom.

402
00:26:20,375 --> 00:26:23,500
Shut up! I'm neither on your side
nor his. I side with our Goddess.

403
00:26:23,583 --> 00:26:25,125
-Glory be to--
-The Goddess!

404
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:26,708
-Everyone together!
-Hail the Goddess!

405
00:26:26,791 --> 00:26:27,875
Once again…

406
00:26:27,958 --> 00:26:28,958
<i>Hey, handsome!</i>

407
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:31,750
<i>What took you</i>
<i>so long to come to me?</i>

408
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:36,750
<i>Now that you're here,</i>
<i>show me what kind of an animal--</i>

409
00:26:36,833 --> 00:26:39,083
I will not do anything
that's being done there!

410
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:41,708
Disgusting!

411
00:26:41,958 --> 00:26:42,833
Indoo…

412
00:26:43,041 --> 00:26:45,791
stop abstaining from
doing adult things. Okay?

413
00:26:46,375 --> 00:26:47,958
You have just had a breakup for now.

414
00:26:48,625 --> 00:26:52,375
If you make a fuss after marriage,
you will end up getting divorced.

415
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:55,791
Why do people make adult films?

416
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,625
So that women like you can watch them
and learn all the dirty little tricks

417
00:27:01,708 --> 00:27:04,708
to be on a par with men.

418
00:27:05,416 --> 00:27:07,916
What does an Indian man want?

419
00:27:08,166 --> 00:27:09,166
What does he want?

420
00:27:09,291 --> 00:27:14,083
He wants his wife to be
a cultured woman during the day,

421
00:27:14,166 --> 00:27:16,500
and a wanton at night.

422
00:27:16,833 --> 00:27:17,833
Really?

423
00:27:19,166 --> 00:27:22,500
We've grown up watching our mothers
preach about being cultured.

424
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:26,208
But you need to watch
these films to be a wanton.

425
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,541
You're right.

426
00:27:28,666 --> 00:27:30,416
Turn on the laptop and start watching.

427
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,583
Don't waste your time.

428
00:27:33,208 --> 00:27:34,125
Go.

429
00:27:34,583 --> 00:27:35,541
Focus.

430
00:27:41,208 --> 00:27:42,708
<i>Hey, handsome!</i>

431
00:27:43,416 --> 00:27:45,750
<i>What took you</i>
<i>so long to come to me?</i>

432
00:27:46,291 --> 00:27:51,416
<i>Now that you're here, show me</i>
<i>what kind of an animal you are.</i>

433
00:27:51,875 --> 00:27:54,083
<i>I've been waiting since ages.</i>

434
00:27:55,083 --> 00:27:56,625
<i>Now is the time.</i>

435
00:27:57,375 --> 00:27:58,625
<i>Come to me, baby.</i>

436
00:27:58,916 --> 00:27:59,875
<i>Come to me.</i>

437
00:28:03,041 --> 00:28:04,291
Are you serious?

438
00:28:04,583 --> 00:28:07,791
She was watching
adult movies on her laptop last night.

439
00:28:08,083 --> 00:28:10,416
You guys are really made for each other.

440
00:28:10,666 --> 00:28:12,708
You have been doing
that for the past two years.

441
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:14,583
Kittu, your mother is looking for you.

442
00:28:14,666 --> 00:28:16,291
You need to get some
things for the prayer meet.

443
00:28:16,375 --> 00:28:17,500
-I'll get going.
-Alright.

444
00:28:18,083 --> 00:28:19,083
Listen!

445
00:28:19,208 --> 00:28:21,083
Buy a nice perfume for me.

446
00:28:21,291 --> 00:28:23,833
-Sure.
-Don't worry, Kittu.

447
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,375
You'll smell like a rose tonight.

448
00:28:28,791 --> 00:28:32,166
Prem, did you look at the sketch
of that Pakistani guy on the third page?

449
00:28:36,125 --> 00:28:37,291
-Take a look at it.
-Yes.

450
00:28:37,375 --> 00:28:39,291
He looks so innocent
but he's a terrorist!

451
00:28:39,375 --> 00:28:40,625
I'm craving a fruit cake.

452
00:28:40,708 --> 00:28:42,166
We'll take one of those.

453
00:28:42,458 --> 00:28:44,625
-We'll take two fruit cakes.
-Should we try the one with cashew?

454
00:28:44,708 --> 00:28:47,166
-Yes, that'll be better.
-This chocolate one also looks good.

455
00:28:56,125 --> 00:28:57,833
-Hello, dear!
-Hello.

456
00:28:58,250 --> 00:28:59,458
Hello, Uncle.

457
00:28:59,583 --> 00:29:00,500
So, dear--

458
00:29:01,125 --> 00:29:02,291
So, dear…

459
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:05,083
have your parents left for Delhi, right?

460
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:07,166
They have gone for
Bunty's admission, right?

461
00:29:07,291 --> 00:29:09,041
Yes, Uncle.
Bunty has gone with them.

462
00:29:09,125 --> 00:29:10,041
What?

463
00:29:10,375 --> 00:29:11,583
I mean…

464
00:29:13,333 --> 00:29:14,833
are you all alone at home?

465
00:29:15,916 --> 00:29:16,791
Yes, Uncle.

466
00:29:16,875 --> 00:29:18,791
Make sure that your room--

467
00:29:18,916 --> 00:29:22,250
I mean, just be careful.
These are bad times.

468
00:29:22,875 --> 00:29:24,166
Did you read today's newspaper?

469
00:29:24,458 --> 00:29:26,458
They've released a Pakistani's sketch.

470
00:29:26,541 --> 00:29:28,291
He's hiding somewhere in Ghaziabad.

471
00:29:28,541 --> 00:29:30,000
So, just be careful, dear.

472
00:29:30,083 --> 00:29:34,291
Make sure you lock all the doors
and windows before you to go sleep.

473
00:29:34,833 --> 00:29:36,916
Why does she need to lock them?

474
00:29:37,458 --> 00:29:38,791
You can call me.

475
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,166
I'll come over.
I'll sleep outside if needed.

476
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:42,291
Why?

477
00:29:42,541 --> 00:29:43,500
Why indeed?

478
00:29:43,583 --> 00:29:44,708
Why only you?

479
00:29:45,708 --> 00:29:47,375
We all will be there.

480
00:29:47,458 --> 00:29:50,041
-There's no need, Uncle.
-Did you hear that?

481
00:29:50,625 --> 00:29:53,750
Do you think a Pakistani
would ever dare to enter my house?

482
00:29:54,666 --> 00:29:58,958
I'm a true Indian. I'll thrash
him and send back to his country.

483
00:30:00,208 --> 00:30:02,000
I dare him to touch me!

484
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,375
I can thrash not one
but three Pakistanis at one go.

485
00:30:07,833 --> 00:30:09,208
My dear…

486
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:11,458
why are you scaring us?

487
00:30:11,666 --> 00:30:13,750
We aren't Pakistanis.

488
00:30:13,833 --> 00:30:15,125
We are your well-wishers.

489
00:30:16,541 --> 00:30:17,541
What?

490
00:30:35,666 --> 00:30:38,541
Satish is the only
real terrorist in your life.

491
00:30:46,125 --> 00:30:49,416
He's already gotten into
a relationship with someone else!

492
00:30:52,708 --> 00:30:55,583
That's what I have been
trying to tell you, Indoo.

493
00:30:56,458 --> 00:30:59,750
The world is progressing
faster than you can imagine.

494
00:31:00,541 --> 00:31:02,250
You should move on as well, girl.

495
00:31:03,166 --> 00:31:04,916
Find a handsome boy,

496
00:31:05,208 --> 00:31:08,875
have sex with him
and make him your boyfriend.

497
00:31:10,083 --> 00:31:12,791
How can I have sex with him
before I make him my boyfriend?

498
00:31:12,875 --> 00:31:14,125
Have a one-night stand with him.

499
00:31:15,208 --> 00:31:16,500
A one-night stand?

500
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:22,125
Pick any movie that is
based on a one-night stand.

501
00:31:22,416 --> 00:31:23,916
It could be in Hindi or English.

502
00:31:24,125 --> 00:31:27,041
A one-night stand story
never ends on that one night.

503
00:31:27,583 --> 00:31:31,791
Indoo, nowadays, all love stories
begin with a one-night stand.

504
00:31:32,458 --> 00:31:33,625
I've seen it in movies.

505
00:31:34,208 --> 00:31:36,000
A boy approaches a girl

506
00:31:36,416 --> 00:31:39,541
at a big party and says,

507
00:31:40,291 --> 00:31:42,875
"Hey, baby! Can I buy you a drink?"

508
00:31:43,583 --> 00:31:45,916
The girl doesn't hold back. She says,

509
00:31:46,416 --> 00:31:49,458
"Just a drink?
How about some desert as well?"

510
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:54,333
And in the very next scene,
both of them are shown naked in bed.

511
00:31:54,833 --> 00:31:57,375
You don't even realize when they did it.

512
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:00,708
But I don't attend parties.

513
00:32:01,666 --> 00:32:04,541
Only those three oldies
hit on me at local parties.

514
00:32:05,833 --> 00:32:08,708
Why don't you find a match online?

515
00:32:08,875 --> 00:32:10,541
You'll find better options.

516
00:32:10,958 --> 00:32:12,291
Do you mean on Fakebook?

517
00:32:12,541 --> 00:32:14,583
No, that's old news.

518
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:15,666
Join Dinder.

519
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:16,958
What's Dinder?

520
00:32:17,416 --> 00:32:18,625
It's a dating app.

521
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:22,416
Once you log in, you'll get to see
the profiles of thousands of boys.

522
00:32:22,583 --> 00:32:24,750
You'll also know how
far they are from you.

523
00:32:24,833 --> 00:32:28,250
You'll know if they are a few kilometers
away or in some other state or country.

524
00:32:28,541 --> 00:32:31,041
All you have to do
is swipe right on the boy you like.

525
00:32:31,125 --> 00:32:35,083
If he likes you back, he will also swipe
right and you two will be a match.

526
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:36,625
And then, you can start texting.

527
00:32:36,708 --> 00:32:40,166
Decide a time and place
to meet and have a one-night stand.

528
00:32:40,916 --> 00:32:43,416
But how do I tell him
that I want a one-night stand?

529
00:32:44,958 --> 00:32:46,666
You wouldn't have to tell him that.

530
00:32:47,125 --> 00:32:51,083
Every man in the world joins
a dating app only for one-night stands.

531
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:54,666
All you need to do is make
a profile and keep swiping right.

532
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:56,208
Your match will handle the rest.

533
00:32:57,166 --> 00:32:58,541
That's great, Sonal.

534
00:32:59,041 --> 00:33:00,583
You are so knowledgeable.

535
00:33:01,625 --> 00:33:03,291
It's important.

536
00:33:03,833 --> 00:33:07,333
You never know what app
comes in handy in one's hour of need.

537
00:33:08,125 --> 00:33:10,291
Give me your phone.
I'll help you make your profile.

555
00:33:58,875 --> 00:34:00,708

00:34:32,791 --> 00:34:33,833
Oh, we have a match!

567
00:34:34,166 --> 00:34:35,166
Show it to me!

568
00:34:38,541 --> 00:34:41,333
Baby, please send nude pics.

569
00:34:42,166 --> 00:34:44,541
Yuck! What is this nonsense?

570
00:34:44,625 --> 00:34:46,500
Well, not everyone is a gentleman.

571
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:48,458
I'm not talking to you!

572
00:34:49,916 --> 00:34:52,208
There are no decent boys on Dinder.

573
00:34:52,416 --> 00:34:53,708
Stop right here!

574
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:55,791
-What happened?
-This guy seems good.

575
00:34:55,875 --> 00:34:56,875
Show it to me.

576
00:34:57,208 --> 00:34:58,125
Samar.

577
00:34:58,208 --> 00:34:59,625
Two miles away.

578
00:35:00,791 --> 00:35:01,750
He has sent me a text.

579
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:02,750
What is it?

580
00:35:03,666 --> 00:35:05,333
Hi, India.

581
00:35:05,625 --> 00:35:06,583
This is Samar.

582
00:35:06,791 --> 00:35:09,166
India? Must be a typo.

583
00:35:10,291 --> 00:35:12,083
You are the one
who made that typo!

584
00:35:12,375 --> 00:35:14,791
You forgot the letter "R" while
typing Indira. Let me correct it.

585
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,375
Wait. Don't do it.

586
00:35:16,791 --> 00:35:18,166
Operate using a secret name.

587
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:19,333
It will ensure your safety.

588
00:35:19,666 --> 00:35:21,083
That's true.

589
00:35:22,208 --> 00:35:24,291
-What should I reply?
-Introduce yourself.

590
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:28,958
Hi, Samar.

591
00:35:29,083 --> 00:35:30,500
This is India.

592
00:35:30,583 --> 00:35:32,458
Ma'am, shall we go ahead?

593
00:35:32,541 --> 00:35:33,750
Wait a minute.

594
00:35:36,208 --> 00:35:37,291
Nice name.

595
00:35:37,375 --> 00:35:38,250
India.

596
00:35:38,333 --> 00:35:40,750
Thank him and ask him what he does.

597
00:35:42,041 --> 00:35:43,958
Thanks a lot.

598
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:45,375
What do you do?

599
00:35:47,625 --> 00:35:49,166
I'm a musician.

600
00:35:49,416 --> 00:35:50,500
What do you do?

601
00:35:50,666 --> 00:35:52,375
Awesome! He's an artist.

602
00:35:53,541 --> 00:35:58,125
I am applying for an air hostess' job.

603
00:35:58,875 --> 00:36:01,875
He looks good and is a musician.
He'll write songs for you.

604
00:36:01,958 --> 00:36:03,000
I think he's perfect.

605
00:36:03,083 --> 00:36:04,583
Don't jump to conclusions.

606
00:36:04,875 --> 00:36:06,166
We have just started chatting.

607
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:07,625
You never know, he might be lying.

608
00:36:07,708 --> 00:36:08,916
You're right.

609
00:36:11,041 --> 00:36:14,666
An air hostess' job is very difficult.

610
00:36:15,041 --> 00:36:17,166
My mom was an air hostess.

611
00:36:18,083 --> 00:36:18,916
Ma'am?

612
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,458
Please wait. We are doing
something very important here.

613
00:36:23,083 --> 00:36:24,875
Ask him why he is on Dinder.

614
00:36:26,541 --> 00:36:29,541
What are you doing here?

615
00:36:29,958 --> 00:36:32,250
How the hell will he understand
what you mean by "here"?

616
00:36:32,333 --> 00:36:33,208
Oh, sorry.

617
00:36:34,916 --> 00:36:38,166
What are you doing on Dinder?

618
00:36:39,916 --> 00:36:41,375
Hey, move aside!

619
00:36:42,791 --> 00:36:45,875
I am looking for
a nice girl for friendship.

620
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,375
Bloody liar!

621
00:36:47,875 --> 00:36:50,583
I understand the nice girl bit,
but what does he mean by friendship?

622
00:36:50,916 --> 00:36:52,416
He might be a nice boy.

623
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:53,375
Really?

624
00:36:53,458 --> 00:36:55,000
Don't be foolish, Indoo.

625
00:36:55,083 --> 00:36:57,541
All the boys in the world
want the same thing.

626
00:36:57,875 --> 00:36:59,291
But he does seem a little shy.

627
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,416
But that's okay. You can initiate.

628
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:04,916
Tell him, "But I'm looking
for something else."

629
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:09,250
Am I doing the right thing, Sonal?

630
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,916
Do you think
what happened with you was right?

631
00:37:12,541 --> 00:37:15,291
It wasn't. And this is
nothing as compared to that.

632
00:37:17,625 --> 00:37:20,375
Can I give you want you want?

633
00:37:22,291 --> 00:37:23,666
He got the hint.

634
00:37:23,833 --> 00:37:24,750
He's smart.

635
00:37:25,416 --> 00:37:26,458
Now, tell him…

636
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:31,000
"If you're a nice
good looking man, you earn well,

637
00:37:31,125 --> 00:37:35,083
you're handsome, have nice quadriceps,
then yes, you can give me what I want."

638
00:37:35,208 --> 00:37:37,041
I am not going to type that.

639
00:37:37,125 --> 00:37:39,166
I'm not sending him
a marriage proposal on Dinder.

640
00:37:40,333 --> 00:37:41,416
I…

641
00:37:42,208 --> 00:37:44,583
I'll tell him I cannot
decide over the phone.

642
00:37:44,666 --> 00:37:46,750
-We'll need to meet for that.
-Alright.

643
00:37:46,875 --> 00:37:48,416
Park it on the side of the road!

644
00:37:49,083 --> 00:37:50,333
I am free.

645
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:51,958
Where do you want to meet?

646
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:54,041
Dinder is such a wonderful app!

647
00:37:54,125 --> 00:37:56,875
You've fixed a meeting
with a boy in just ten minutes!

648
00:37:57,750 --> 00:37:58,875
Where will you meet him?

649
00:37:59,708 --> 00:38:00,833
Where do I meet him?

650
00:38:01,458 --> 00:38:02,750
How about Café Coffee Bay?

651
00:38:03,041 --> 00:38:05,375
Will you have a one-night stand
at Café Coffee Bay?

652
00:38:05,625 --> 00:38:08,916
I'll meet him there and then decide
whether I can take him home or not.

653
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,041
As if he's going to show you
his true colors at the coffee shop!

654
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:14,583
Well, that's true.

655
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:16,708
Come on, get aside!

656
00:38:18,083 --> 00:38:20,708
If you don't want to meet, it's okay.

657
00:38:20,833 --> 00:38:22,708
If you keep thinking,
you'll lose the guy.

658
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:24,208
I don't care.

659
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:26,875
I don't want to bring
the wrong guy home in haste.

660
00:38:26,958 --> 00:38:28,291
Stop it, Indoo.

661
00:38:28,416 --> 00:38:31,291
You couldn't even judge the guy
you were dating for six months.

662
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:33,083
Do you think you'll be
able to judge a new guy?

663
00:38:42,166 --> 00:38:43,500
Did you reject him?

664
00:38:44,083 --> 00:38:45,208
I sent him my address.

665
00:38:45,541 --> 00:38:46,500
Let me see.

666
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,916
"Milan Niwas, block number 13,
Kavi Nagar, Ghaziabad.

667
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,541
Let's meet at 6:00 p.m.
Also, carry a bag with you."

668
00:38:52,625 --> 00:38:53,708
Why do you need the bag?

669
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:55,333
Why should I tell you?

670
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:57,500
Oh, I see! It's a secret!

671
00:38:57,625 --> 00:39:00,041
Well, that's okay. It's your day.

672
00:39:00,125 --> 00:39:01,666
You're going to hit the jackpot tonight.

673
00:39:18,125 --> 00:39:19,208
Greetings.

674
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:22,416
The plan is on for tonight.

675
00:39:28,958 --> 00:39:31,083
Please stop right here.

676
00:39:31,916 --> 00:39:35,083
You need to work on your riding skills.
You caused a traffic jam over here.

677
00:39:35,541 --> 00:39:39,458
-Unbelievable.
-I think I should take some precaution.

678
00:39:39,916 --> 00:39:43,875
You're right. You don't want to
get pregnant after a one-night stand.

679
00:39:46,333 --> 00:39:47,500
I didn't mean that!

680
00:39:48,125 --> 00:39:50,000
I mean that precaution
is necessary as well.

681
00:39:50,833 --> 00:39:53,000
But I have invited a stranger home.

682
00:39:53,541 --> 00:39:55,541
I need to make
some arrangements for my safety.

683
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:57,500
Yes, your safety is important as well.

684
00:39:57,875 --> 00:39:59,833
Go inside and make
arrangements for your safety.

685
00:40:00,708 --> 00:40:04,041
I'll talk to Uday and arrange
for some "precaution" for you.

686
00:40:04,458 --> 00:40:05,666
-Go on.
-Bye.

687
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:07,125
Hey, listen!

688
00:40:08,291 --> 00:40:09,333
Don't worry.

689
00:40:09,791 --> 00:40:11,250
I'll wear a matching set.

690
00:40:13,083 --> 00:40:14,125
Attagirl!

691
00:40:14,833 --> 00:40:16,625
Let's go and cause
some more traffic jams.

692
00:40:16,708 --> 00:40:18,208
ENGLISH PHARMACY

693
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:20,458
Sir, I need two packets of condom.

00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,916
<i>Eat, drink and be merry</i>

701
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,791
<i>Maybe crash a party</i>

702
00:40:35,916 --> 00:40:37,875
<i>It's all about one night</i>

703
00:40:37,958 --> 00:40:39,750
<i>Just swipe right and hook up</i>

704
00:40:45,833 --> 00:40:47,375
<i>Single ladies' song</i>

705
00:40:53,541 --> 00:40:55,166
<i>Single ladies' song</i>

706
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:56,458
<i>A song for girls</i>

707
00:40:56,583 --> 00:40:58,250
<i>It's a song for single girls</i>

708
00:40:58,416 --> 00:41:00,125
<i>It's a song for naughty girls</i>

709
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:01,291
<i>Listen up!</i>

710
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:02,833
<i>Single ladies' song</i>

711
00:41:02,916 --> 00:41:04,208
<i>A song for girls</i>

712
00:41:04,291 --> 00:41:05,958
<i>It's a song for single girls</i>

713
00:41:06,041 --> 00:41:07,791
<i>It's a song for naughty girls</i>

714
00:41:07,875 --> 00:41:08,750
<i>Listen up!</i>

715
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:10,500
<i>Single ladies' song</i>

716
00:41:10,583 --> 00:41:14,166
<i>To hell with all those</i>
<i>Who cannot tolerate your tantrums</i>

717
00:41:14,416 --> 00:41:17,916
<i>You are a queen</i>
<i>And you need not hold back</i>

718
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,000
<i>Wear some lipstick</i>
<i>And an expensive mascara</i>

719
00:41:22,083 --> 00:41:25,958
<i>You can melt the hearts</i>
<i>Of the toughest guys</i>

720
00:41:38,291 --> 00:41:39,166
<i>Look at this guy!</i>

721
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:42,041
<i>He's already at my</i>
<i>doorstep in a single chat.</i>

722
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,583
<i>Sonal is certainly</i>
<i>right about all the boys.</i>

723
00:41:44,958 --> 00:41:47,416
<i>These scoundrels are always</i>
<i>ready for one-night stands.</i>

724
00:41:47,625 --> 00:41:50,708
<i>Well, anyway, it's not like</i>
<i>I plan on marrying him.</i>

725
00:41:53,541 --> 00:41:54,541
India?

726
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:55,791
Yes.

727
00:41:56,125 --> 00:41:57,125
Hello, Samar.

728
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:58,208
Hi.

729
00:41:58,791 --> 00:42:00,250
It's good that you brought a bag.

730
00:42:00,666 --> 00:42:01,916
Oh, yes.

731
00:42:02,625 --> 00:42:04,333
But, why do you need the bag?

732
00:42:15,541 --> 00:42:19,083
You finally got the time
to check the water purifier!

733
00:42:19,166 --> 00:42:20,833
I made a complaint long back!

734
00:42:20,916 --> 00:42:23,125
I had called you last week,
but you didn't show up!

735
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:25,875
And today, you're here to check
the water purifier out of the blue!

736
00:42:27,875 --> 00:42:30,833
I can't help it, ma'am.

737
00:42:31,791 --> 00:42:33,333
We get many complaints in a day.

738
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:36,750
I've myself made
a complaint for my water purifier.

739
00:42:37,375 --> 00:42:40,083
It's been three months
since I've been waiting for a resolution.

740
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:42,500
Well, alright.

741
00:42:42,583 --> 00:42:44,833
I'm sure your turn will come very soon.

742
00:42:44,916 --> 00:42:46,083
Please come in.

743
00:42:46,166 --> 00:42:47,166
Okay.

744
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:50,750
What can I do now?

745
00:42:54,416 --> 00:42:56,500
Welcome. Please come in.

746
00:42:58,166 --> 00:42:59,958
I am sorry about that drama.

747
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:02,583
You know, people start
talking behind your back.

748
00:43:02,666 --> 00:43:03,916
No. I totally understand.

749
00:43:04,291 --> 00:43:06,000
People here just
talk behind your back.

750
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:08,250
People in my colony
would tear me apart.

751
00:43:11,166 --> 00:43:12,500
Why are you standing?

752
00:43:12,791 --> 00:43:14,541
-Have a seat.
-Thank you.

753
00:43:27,041 --> 00:43:28,625
I must say you act well.

754
00:43:29,583 --> 00:43:30,708
Ever since I was a kid.

755
00:43:40,583 --> 00:43:41,791
Would you like something?

756
00:43:43,666 --> 00:43:45,000
No, thank you. I don't drink.

757
00:43:45,625 --> 00:43:47,458
No, I meant tea or coffee.

758
00:43:47,666 --> 00:43:48,833
I don't drink either.

759
00:43:49,875 --> 00:43:50,833
Okay.

760
00:43:53,375 --> 00:43:54,875
Do you think I am lying?

761
00:43:57,666 --> 00:44:00,750
I attended a wedding
two days ago and you were there as well.

762
00:44:01,291 --> 00:44:03,333
-Shit.
-You were pretty sloshed.

763
00:44:03,416 --> 00:44:05,625
No, I had ordered for a soda.

764
00:44:05,708 --> 00:44:07,791
I don't know what they spiked it with.

765
00:44:07,875 --> 00:44:09,083
I'm not like that.

766
00:44:09,291 --> 00:44:10,166
What do you mean?

767
00:44:10,833 --> 00:44:12,708
-No--
-I don't judge those who like to drink.

768
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,750
I mean one cannot be bad
just because they drink.

769
00:44:16,416 --> 00:44:17,875
It's just a matter of choice.

770
00:44:18,041 --> 00:44:19,666
I just like tea and coffee.

771
00:44:20,208 --> 00:44:21,250
What would you like more?

772
00:44:21,958 --> 00:44:23,041
What do you like?

773
00:44:23,333 --> 00:44:24,333
Tea or coffee?

774
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,375
I like the tea that my mom makes
and the coffee that I make.

775
00:44:27,666 --> 00:44:30,916
So, who's going to make what now?

776
00:44:32,625 --> 00:44:36,625
Well, there's no one else at home.

777
00:44:42,916 --> 00:44:44,458
-Coffee.
-Oh, thank you.

778
00:44:44,833 --> 00:44:46,583
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

779
00:44:47,833 --> 00:44:49,000
What does your brother do?

780
00:44:49,291 --> 00:44:50,583
He just cleared high school.

781
00:44:50,708 --> 00:44:52,000
He wants to be an engineer.

782
00:44:52,083 --> 00:44:54,583
Oh! And you plan to join the airlines.
That's really nice.

783
00:44:54,666 --> 00:44:55,625
Thank you.

784
00:44:56,541 --> 00:44:59,708
You are the first person
who didn't discourage me.

785
00:45:01,041 --> 00:45:03,208
Perhaps because your
mother was also an air hostess.

786
00:45:05,833 --> 00:45:09,708
Well, no one objects when
guys work as the cabin crew.

787
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:13,125
But everyone judges a girl
when she chooses to be an air hostess.

788
00:45:14,166 --> 00:45:15,291
That's not fair.

789
00:45:17,958 --> 00:45:20,291
It's good to know
that you don't think so.

790
00:45:22,791 --> 00:45:23,791
So, you tell me.

791
00:45:24,583 --> 00:45:25,833
What kind of music do you make?

792
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,708
Well, so far I've been
making songs only on requests.

793
00:45:31,625 --> 00:45:33,958
But now I'm thinking
about making a single.

794
00:45:36,041 --> 00:45:37,625
What kind of music do you like?

795
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:39,458
Bollywood.

796
00:45:39,791 --> 00:45:42,125
Party songs, romantic songs,
sad songs and even rap songs.

797
00:45:42,208 --> 00:45:43,958
Anything works as long as it's Bollywood.

798
00:45:44,625 --> 00:45:46,125
I also love Bollywood.

799
00:45:50,208 --> 00:45:52,250
-Where are you from?
-Hyderabad.

800
00:45:52,333 --> 00:45:53,958
Hyderabad?
So, how come you're here?

801
00:45:54,083 --> 00:45:56,583
I'm visiting my granduncle.
I'm here for a week.

802
00:45:56,666 --> 00:45:58,666
You know the temple of
Goddess Kesari in Patel Nagar?

803
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,333
Next to Bablu Hair Salon?

804
00:46:00,416 --> 00:46:01,458
He lives in that vicinity.

805
00:46:01,541 --> 00:46:02,875
I take that route every day.

806
00:46:04,833 --> 00:46:06,875
Small world, right?

807
00:46:11,375 --> 00:46:13,583
So, will you stay for dinner?

808
00:46:15,333 --> 00:46:19,666
Well, I'll surely feel hungry
if I'm staying here for long.

809
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:23,416
No, I mean I'll have to
order food from the restaurant.

810
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:24,333
Oh, please allow me.

811
00:46:24,416 --> 00:46:25,958
-I'll order from Gomato.
-No, I'll order it.

812
00:46:26,041 --> 00:46:27,166
-My phone--
-Listen!

813
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:29,916
You made coffee for me.
So, let me treat you with dinner.

814
00:46:30,166 --> 00:46:31,208
Amazing!

815
00:46:31,458 --> 00:46:33,416
Would you like
vegetarian or non-vegetarian food?

816
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:35,250
How about some chicken?

817
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:37,541
-Biryani?
-That would be the best!

818
00:46:41,833 --> 00:46:44,000
Jagdish Kumar is on
his way with your order.

819
00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:45,250
Done.

820
00:47:05,458 --> 00:47:06,375
So…

821
00:47:07,333 --> 00:47:08,333
what's up?

822
00:47:11,041 --> 00:47:12,916
All's well.

823
00:47:18,458 --> 00:47:21,208
Well… do you watch movies?

824
00:47:21,833 --> 00:47:23,166
Yes, of course.

825
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:25,291
What kind of movies do you like?

826
00:47:25,791 --> 00:47:28,208
-Old Hindi movies.
-Like?

827
00:47:29,416 --> 00:47:30,791
Like…

828
00:47:32,125 --> 00:47:33,791
<i>Kashmir Ki Kali.</i>

829
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:36,625
That's my favorite as well.

830
00:47:37,083 --> 00:47:38,250
Shall we watch it together?

831
00:47:40,291 --> 00:47:43,208
KASHMIR KI KALI

832
00:47:51,166 --> 00:47:52,083
<i>Who is it?</i>

833
00:47:53,041 --> 00:47:53,958
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

834
00:47:54,041 --> 00:47:55,708
-<i>We touched.</i>
-<i>You!</i>

835
00:47:55,791 --> 00:47:57,541
<i>It's okay. This is how it begins.</i>

836
00:47:58,125 --> 00:47:59,166
<i>I should take the next step.</i>

837
00:48:01,583 --> 00:48:03,291
<i>He's a decent guy.</i>
<i>I shouldn't be afraid.</i>

838
00:48:11,333 --> 00:48:12,666
<i>Shit! He's holding my hand!</i>

839
00:48:13,333 --> 00:48:15,083
<i>What's next? A kiss?</i>

840
00:48:16,208 --> 00:48:18,125
<i>Alright. Let's go for it.</i>

841
00:48:46,083 --> 00:48:48,500
<i>God has been generous with you</i>

842
00:48:48,583 --> 00:48:50,916
<i>He has made me your beau</i>

843
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,041
<i>Oh, temptress!</i>
<i>How do I praise your beauty?</i>

844
00:48:53,125 --> 00:48:55,291
<i>My words won't do justice</i>

845
00:49:05,041 --> 00:49:07,666
<i>God has been generous with you</i>

846
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:09,916
<i>He has made me your beau</i>

847
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,125
<i>Oh, temptress!</i>
<i>How do I praise your beauty?</i>

848
00:49:12,208 --> 00:49:14,291
<i>My words won't do justice</i>

849
00:49:14,541 --> 00:49:17,166
<i>I have seen Kashmir</i>
<i>I have seen Kanyakumari</i>

850
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:19,541
<i>And yet I never</i>
<i>Came across a girl like you</i>

851
00:49:19,625 --> 00:49:21,666
<i>Ever since the time I met you</i>

852
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:24,375
<i>I have lost control of myself</i>

853
00:49:24,458 --> 00:49:26,750
<i>My heart is yours</i>

854
00:49:26,833 --> 00:49:29,125
<i>It now belongs to you</i>

855
00:49:29,208 --> 00:49:31,500
<i>Come closer to me</i>

856
00:49:31,583 --> 00:49:33,791
<i>We'll see what transpires</i>

857
00:49:33,875 --> 00:49:36,291
<i>My heart is yours</i>

858
00:49:36,375 --> 00:49:38,708
<i>It now belongs to you</i>

859
00:49:38,791 --> 00:49:41,125
<i>Come closer to me</i>

860
00:49:41,208 --> 00:49:43,583
<i>We'll see what transpires</i>

861
00:49:52,708 --> 00:49:55,000
<i>Oh, my!</i>

862
00:49:55,083 --> 00:49:57,750
<i>If I fall in love with you</i>

863
00:49:57,833 --> 00:50:00,208
<i>I'll be taking too big a risk</i>

864
00:50:00,291 --> 00:50:01,333
<i>They keep tormenting me</i>

865
00:50:01,416 --> 00:50:02,541
<i>They are driving me crazy</i>

866
00:50:02,625 --> 00:50:04,541
<i>Your eyes are intoxicating</i>

867
00:50:04,625 --> 00:50:07,166
<i>You can set me on fire</i>
<i>With a single touch</i>

868
00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:09,666
<i>You've been stealing glances</i>
<i>A bit too much</i>

869
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:10,625
<i>You are the one</i>

870
00:50:10,708 --> 00:50:14,458
<i>You are the only one I belong with</i>

871
00:50:14,541 --> 00:50:16,875
<i>My heart is yours</i>

872
00:50:16,958 --> 00:50:19,291
<i>It now belongs to you</i>

873
00:50:19,375 --> 00:50:21,500
<i>Come closer to me</i>

874
00:50:21,583 --> 00:50:24,041
<i>We'll see what transpires</i>

875
00:50:24,125 --> 00:50:26,458
<i>My heart is yours</i>

876
00:50:26,541 --> 00:50:28,833
<i>It now belongs to you</i>

877
00:50:28,916 --> 00:50:31,208
<i>Come closer to me</i>

878
00:50:31,291 --> 00:50:33,708
<i>We'll see what transpires</i>

879
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:49,250
<i>There's this strange feeling in my heart</i>

880
00:50:50,083 --> 00:50:53,750
<i>I have butterflies in my stomach</i>

881
00:50:54,583 --> 00:50:58,500
<i>I'm lost in your dreams</i>

882
00:50:59,583 --> 00:51:01,041
<i>My brain, my heart</i>

883
00:51:01,125 --> 00:51:02,250
<i>My brain, my heart</i>

884
00:51:02,333 --> 00:51:04,708
<i>You rule my brain, my heart</i>
<i>And my soul</i>

885
00:51:04,791 --> 00:51:07,041
<i>My heart is yours</i>

886
00:51:07,125 --> 00:51:09,458
<i>It now belongs to you</i>

887
00:51:09,541 --> 00:51:11,750
<i>Come closer to me</i>

888
00:51:11,833 --> 00:51:14,083
<i>We'll see what transpires</i>

889
00:51:14,166 --> 00:51:16,625
<i>My heart is yours</i>

890
00:51:16,708 --> 00:51:19,000
<i>It now belongs to you</i>

891
00:51:19,083 --> 00:51:21,291
<i>Come closer to me</i>

892
00:51:21,375 --> 00:51:23,708
<i>We'll see what transpires</i>

893
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:45,833
Yes, Mom?

894
00:51:45,916 --> 00:51:48,458
How are you?
Is everything alright?

895
00:51:49,916 --> 00:51:51,875
Yes. I was getting ready for bed.

896
00:51:52,625 --> 00:51:55,666
Okay. I don't think I'll
be getting any sleep here.

897
00:51:55,958 --> 00:51:59,166
You know your Aunt's house
is small and it doesn't have many rooms.

898
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:02,375
I have to share the room
with these two monsters.

899
00:52:03,333 --> 00:52:05,750
Anyway, I'll talk to you later.

900
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,208
Take care.

901
00:52:07,291 --> 00:52:08,583
Yes, Mom.

902
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:09,916
Good night.

903
00:52:11,666 --> 00:52:13,041
-Sorry.
-No, that's alright.

904
00:52:14,458 --> 00:52:16,500
<i>Well, I wasn't crazy.</i>

905
00:52:16,583 --> 00:52:19,708
<i>But your innocence is</i>
<i>making me lose my mind.</i>

906
00:52:19,791 --> 00:52:21,708
<i>Leave me. Let me go.</i>

907
00:52:22,583 --> 00:52:27,083
<i>No. Now that I've held you,</i>
<i>I won't let go of you.</i>

908
00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:29,333
<i>You can't trust someone as mad as me.</i>

909
00:52:29,916 --> 00:52:32,208
<i>Sometimes, I even bite.</i>

910
00:52:32,291 --> 00:52:33,208
<i>Move!</i>

911
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:35,041
<i>Have you really lost it?</i>

912
00:52:35,666 --> 00:52:38,041
<i>Yes, everyone seems</i>
<i>to have lost it today.</i>

913
00:52:38,333 --> 00:52:41,916
<i>You and me, these flowers and buds,</i>
<i>and the weather.</i>

914
00:52:42,458 --> 00:52:43,458
<i>Look over there!</i>

915
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
<i>The clouds!</i>

916
00:52:46,875 --> 00:52:48,416
I have never done this before.

917
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:49,458
This is my first time.

918
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:51,791
Oh… okay.

919
00:52:52,375 --> 00:52:53,833
You didn't tell me.

920
00:52:54,791 --> 00:52:57,333
Sorry. Listen, I understand
if you don't want to do this.

921
00:52:57,416 --> 00:52:58,541
No, it's not that.

922
00:52:58,625 --> 00:53:01,125
-That's the reason why we've met.
-No, I totally understand.

923
00:53:01,208 --> 00:53:03,750
I mean, your first time
is supposed to be very special.

924
00:53:04,083 --> 00:53:05,208
You always remember it.

925
00:53:05,291 --> 00:53:06,916
You cannot do it with just anyone.

926
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,583
The person must be special.
I understand.

927
00:53:08,666 --> 00:53:09,750
Right?

928
00:53:09,916 --> 00:53:12,708
Actually, I thought Satish
would be my first as well as my last.

929
00:53:13,375 --> 00:53:14,541
But that didn't happen.

930
00:53:14,625 --> 00:53:16,041
Is Satish your boyfriend?

931
00:53:16,125 --> 00:53:17,250
Ex-boyfriend.

932
00:53:18,291 --> 00:53:21,500
It doesn't seem like you have moved on.

933
00:53:21,666 --> 00:53:23,666
After all, I'm a human.

934
00:53:23,833 --> 00:53:25,541
How can I move on in just two weeks?

935
00:53:26,041 --> 00:53:27,958
I'm an Indian woman
and I'm very emotional.

936
00:53:28,791 --> 00:53:30,291
How is that interrelated?

937
00:53:31,125 --> 00:53:33,166
I mean girls all around
the world are emotional.

938
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:35,291
-So are the boys.
-Nonsense!

939
00:53:35,833 --> 00:53:39,416
That scoundrel already started dating
another girl.

940
00:53:39,625 --> 00:53:42,583
How do you know
that girl was his new girlfriend?

941
00:53:42,666 --> 00:53:44,333
She could have been
a friend or a cousin.

942
00:53:44,416 --> 00:53:45,916
I am sure about it!

943
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,250
The way she was holding him,

944
00:53:48,333 --> 00:53:50,791
anyone could've guessed
what was cooking between them!

945
00:53:51,041 --> 00:53:54,500
Please don't tell me
that she was holding him tightly

946
00:53:54,583 --> 00:53:56,208
because she was
scared to sit on the bike!

947
00:53:56,291 --> 00:53:58,333
I know how boys are!

948
00:53:58,458 --> 00:54:00,000
They all want the same thing.

949
00:54:00,083 --> 00:54:02,250
They feign love just
to get what they want.

950
00:54:02,666 --> 00:54:04,708
Now take us for example.

951
00:54:05,041 --> 00:54:06,250
My friend forced me.

952
00:54:06,333 --> 00:54:08,583
She insisted that I practice sex

953
00:54:08,666 --> 00:54:11,291
so that I don't lose my boyfriend
when I get into a relationship.

954
00:54:11,375 --> 00:54:13,791
I took her advice,
used Dinder and called you here.

955
00:54:13,875 --> 00:54:15,416
But, why did you come here?

956
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:16,875
Your intentions are quite clear.

957
00:54:16,958 --> 00:54:18,791
There you are with me now!

958
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:34,125
I think I should leave.

959
00:54:34,541 --> 00:54:35,875
No, please. I'm sorry.

960
00:54:36,125 --> 00:54:37,208
Please have a seat.

961
00:54:37,291 --> 00:54:39,916
I… I didn't mean that.

962
00:54:40,541 --> 00:54:41,666
Please stay for dinner.

963
00:54:46,166 --> 00:54:47,291
Sorry.

964
00:54:50,541 --> 00:54:51,791
You are crazy, Indoo.

965
00:54:52,041 --> 00:54:53,250
Who says such things?

966
00:54:53,958 --> 00:54:55,083
Tell me something.

967
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:56,875
How does he look?

968
00:54:57,500 --> 00:55:01,833
He's good looking and he seems
very decent and well educated.

969
00:55:02,291 --> 00:55:04,500
We even watched
<i>Kashmir Ki Kali</i> together.

970
00:55:04,958 --> 00:55:06,750
I'm sure he's irritated with me now.

971
00:55:06,833 --> 00:55:07,875
What should I do?

972
00:55:07,958 --> 00:55:09,750
No, he's not irritated with you.

973
00:55:09,833 --> 00:55:10,791
He's a boy!

974
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,416
Boys start getting irritated only after
they've got what they want from you.

975
00:55:14,916 --> 00:55:16,000
Do one thing.

976
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:18,250
Do you remember the adult movie
you watched last night?

977
00:55:18,333 --> 00:55:22,416
Just behave like the actress
of that movie.

978
00:55:22,791 --> 00:55:24,625
Everything will be okay.

979
00:55:24,791 --> 00:55:25,666
Don't worry.

980
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,625
Alright. Bye.

981
00:55:30,958 --> 00:55:32,833
-Go away!
-Go away!

982
00:55:33,791 --> 00:55:35,666
My baby hasn't eaten anything.

983
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:37,750
Open your mouth.

984
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:41,541
Please sit down.

985
00:55:42,750 --> 00:55:43,958
I'll sit down as well.

986
00:55:45,416 --> 00:55:46,833
Sit next to me.

987
00:55:53,541 --> 00:55:55,458
Have you watched any adult movie?

988
00:55:57,416 --> 00:55:58,458
Why do you want to know that?

989
00:55:58,625 --> 00:56:00,125
I have seen a few of them.

990
00:56:00,750 --> 00:56:02,541
Do you know what the
actresses do in the movie?

991
00:56:04,083 --> 00:56:05,125
What do they do?

992
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:18,708
India, are you okay?

993
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,041
India?

994
00:56:28,125 --> 00:56:30,041
Hey, handsome!

995
00:56:31,583 --> 00:56:33,416
What took you so long…

996
00:56:34,166 --> 00:56:36,208
to come to me?

997
00:56:39,250 --> 00:56:40,875
Now that you are here…

998
00:56:41,750 --> 00:56:44,125
show me what kind of an animal you are.

999
00:56:44,708 --> 00:56:46,083
India, I don't think…

1000
00:56:47,166 --> 00:56:50,708
I have been waiting for such a long time.

1001
00:56:51,416 --> 00:56:52,625
For ages!

1002
00:56:54,333 --> 00:56:57,083
-Now is the time.
-I don't think so.

1003
00:56:57,666 --> 00:56:59,291
Now is the time.

1004
00:57:01,041 --> 00:57:03,166
-Now is the time--
-Shit!

1005
00:57:04,333 --> 00:57:06,333
I'm sorry.
I had seen that in the adult film.

1006
00:57:06,416 --> 00:57:07,916
-Let me help you.
-No, that's fine.

1007
00:57:08,083 --> 00:57:11,125
I feel like an idiot.
I'm going to kill Sonal!

1008
00:57:19,916 --> 00:57:22,250
Do you have Pakistani citizenship as well?

1009
00:57:23,416 --> 00:57:24,458
Yes.

1010
00:57:25,166 --> 00:57:27,750
I have Pakistani citizenship
just like you have Indian citizenship.

1011
00:57:27,833 --> 00:57:30,583
But you told me that
you're from Hyderabad.

1012
00:57:31,916 --> 00:57:32,875
So what?

1013
00:57:33,583 --> 00:57:36,916
Just like Kashmir
is in India as well as in Pakistan,

1014
00:57:37,166 --> 00:57:39,041
similarly, Hyderabad
is a city in Pakistan.

1015
00:57:46,708 --> 00:57:47,833
Is there a problem?

1016
00:57:49,333 --> 00:57:50,375
No.

1017
00:57:51,958 --> 00:57:54,000
Why would I have a problem?

1018
00:57:55,916 --> 00:57:57,958
Pakistan is such a nice country.

1019
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:00,916
No wonder you are a musician!

1020
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:03,375
The best musicians are from Pakistan.

1021
00:58:04,541 --> 00:58:07,291
Javed Bashir, Reshma, Atif Aslam.

1022
00:58:07,375 --> 00:58:08,291
The best!

1023
00:58:08,750 --> 00:58:12,125
Nothing like that. There are great
musicians in your country as well.

1024
00:58:12,833 --> 00:58:13,666
Bappi Lahiri.

1025
00:58:13,750 --> 00:58:14,708
Anu Malik.

1026
00:58:15,583 --> 00:58:17,291
-Pritam.
-That's true.

1027
00:58:20,750 --> 00:58:22,250
Make yourself comfortable.

1028
00:58:22,416 --> 00:58:24,791
I'll go to the washroom
and be right back.

1029
00:58:25,375 --> 00:58:26,583
Let me take my phone.

1030
00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:31,125
So what if he's a Pakistani?
He's still a human being.

1031
00:58:31,208 --> 00:58:33,333
And you yourself said
that he's a nice guy.

1032
00:58:33,416 --> 00:58:35,416
I didn't know he was a Pakistani.

1033
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:37,958
Do you want me to make out
with a Pakistani?

1034
00:58:38,041 --> 00:58:39,083
No way!

1035
00:58:39,291 --> 00:58:41,083
The first time is supposed to be special.

1036
00:58:41,166 --> 00:58:43,500
And the person should be special as well.

1037
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,166
Indoo, tell me one thing.

1038
00:58:49,625 --> 00:58:52,500
Didn't Uncle Ranjeet mention
something about a Pakistani this morning?

1039
00:58:52,833 --> 00:58:54,083
It was on the news as well.

1040
00:58:55,250 --> 00:58:56,333
What if he's the guy?

1041
00:59:00,958 --> 00:59:01,958
Call the cops.

1042
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:06,125
Sir.

1043
00:59:07,916 --> 00:59:10,041
We just received information
from IB about two guys.

1044
00:59:10,125 --> 00:59:13,125
They have sent a picture of one.
His name is Maqsood Ibrahim.

1045
00:59:13,208 --> 00:59:15,625
He's the guy who shot Lakhan.

1046
00:59:15,708 --> 00:59:16,666
What about the second guy?

1047
00:59:16,750 --> 00:59:18,500
We don't have much information on him yet.

1048
00:59:18,583 --> 00:59:21,666
All we know is he's in India
disguised as a Pakistani tourist.

1049
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,250
We don't know his location
or the name he's been using.

1050
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:29,500
Get me the details of all the
Pakistanis currently residing in India.

1051
00:59:30,208 --> 00:59:32,916
And share Maqsood Ibrahim's
picture with all the news channels.

1052
00:59:33,083 --> 00:59:34,125
Okay.

1053
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,958
We need to tighten the security, Chautala.

1054
00:59:39,291 --> 00:59:41,833
We cannot let these
two terrorists roam freely.

1055
00:59:50,541 --> 00:59:54,541
<i>And that's how you</i>
<i>invite trouble for yourself.</i>

1056
00:59:55,083 --> 00:59:56,791
<i>Back then, I didn't know</i>

1057
00:59:56,916 --> 00:59:59,833
<i>this isn't just a little trouble,</i>
<i>but a catastrophe!</i>

1058
01:00:00,166 --> 01:00:02,750
<i>The climax is yet to come, my friend!</i>

1059
01:00:04,791 --> 01:00:07,458
<i>Satish, please try to understand.</i>

1060
01:00:07,750 --> 01:00:09,166
<i>I'm a married woman now.</i>

1061
01:00:09,250 --> 01:00:10,583
<i>I can't come over.</i>

1062
01:00:10,666 --> 01:00:11,875
Come on, Alka!

1063
01:00:13,041 --> 01:00:15,333
So what if you're married?

1064
01:00:16,333 --> 01:00:19,583
Believe me.
We can cheat on our partners.

1065
01:00:20,833 --> 01:00:22,083
One last time, please.

1066
01:00:23,250 --> 01:00:24,750
We'll try a new position.

1067
01:00:24,958 --> 01:00:25,958
<i>Go to hell!</i>

1068
01:00:35,250 --> 01:00:36,125
No.

1069
01:00:37,166 --> 01:00:38,125
No.

1070
01:00:39,375 --> 01:00:40,750
No way.

1071
01:01:01,750 --> 01:01:02,833
Just a second.

1072
01:01:07,958 --> 01:01:08,791
Hello?

1073
01:01:09,208 --> 01:01:12,375
Hi… how are you, Indoo?

1074
01:01:16,833 --> 01:01:17,833
What do you want?

1075
01:01:19,458 --> 01:01:20,791
I'm sorry, Indoo.

1076
01:01:22,166 --> 01:01:24,000
I shouldn't have done that to you.

1077
01:01:24,375 --> 01:01:26,416
I'll never repeat my mistake.

1078
01:01:26,625 --> 01:01:28,000
<i>Please forgive me.</i>

1079
01:01:28,583 --> 01:01:29,750
-<i>Indoo--</i>
-Where are you?

1080
01:01:31,250 --> 01:01:32,333
Do you want to meet?

1081
01:01:34,250 --> 01:01:36,000
My family is out of town.

1082
01:01:36,708 --> 01:01:37,958
You can come over if you want.

1083
01:01:39,708 --> 01:01:41,291
I'll be at your doorstep in ten minutes.

1084
01:01:56,875 --> 01:01:59,625
<i>My God!</i>
<i>Look at the guy's confidence!</i>

1085
01:01:59,791 --> 01:02:02,583
<i>They want girls at their beck and call.</i>

1086
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,250
<i>They shamelessly cheat</i>
<i>and then plead for forgiveness.</i>

1087
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:21,833
-Careful!
-Thanks, bro.

1088
01:02:21,916 --> 01:02:23,666
I am not a bro but beau.

1089
01:02:40,583 --> 01:02:41,541
Who is he?

1090
01:02:41,833 --> 01:02:43,041
Why are you asking her?

1091
01:02:43,208 --> 01:02:44,333
You can ask me.

1092
01:02:48,166 --> 01:02:49,166
Who are you?

1093
01:02:49,458 --> 01:02:50,541
I'm her boyfriend.

1094
01:02:51,166 --> 01:02:52,166
Is there a problem?

1095
01:02:55,458 --> 01:02:56,500
What about me?

1096
01:02:58,583 --> 01:02:59,666
You are a fool.

1097
01:03:03,166 --> 01:03:04,500
But you said that no one's home.

1098
01:03:04,583 --> 01:03:08,375
No. She said that
her family is out of town.

1099
01:03:09,125 --> 01:03:10,958
She didn't say anything
about her boyfriend.

1100
01:03:14,916 --> 01:03:16,083
Why did you call me?

1101
01:03:16,750 --> 01:03:17,791
Come here.

1102
01:03:18,125 --> 01:03:20,375
We've got nothing to hide.
A little PDA is acceptable.

1103
01:03:26,041 --> 01:03:27,125
So, everything--

1104
01:03:28,291 --> 01:03:29,250
You--

1105
01:03:30,166 --> 01:03:31,166
Did you do it?

1106
01:03:31,541 --> 01:03:34,916
You should ask what and
where did all of this happen.

1107
01:03:35,458 --> 01:03:36,916
Bedroom, bathroom, kitchen--

1108
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,083
But the kitchen's that way!

1109
01:03:45,875 --> 01:03:48,250
When you're standing
in front of a hot girl like her,

1110
01:03:48,333 --> 01:03:51,333
you should pay attention
to her and not the surroundings!

1111
01:03:51,916 --> 01:03:53,875
Do you understand why
she didn't do it with you?

1112
01:03:53,958 --> 01:03:55,750
It's okay.
Keep this in mind for the next time.

1113
01:04:06,458 --> 01:04:08,250
Get out!

1114
01:04:12,833 --> 01:04:14,583
You ripped him apart
and taught him a lesson.

1115
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:16,500
He'll never cheat on anyone again.

1116
01:04:16,583 --> 01:04:17,875
-Get dressed.
-Hey!

1117
01:04:36,833 --> 01:04:39,375
I need to get him out of here.

1118
01:04:41,041 --> 01:04:43,625
We are done. Get out…

1119
01:04:44,291 --> 01:04:45,416
No, I can't say that.

1120
01:04:47,208 --> 01:04:48,541
I'll put on an act.

1121
01:04:49,583 --> 01:04:51,333
I have a fever--

1122
01:04:51,708 --> 01:04:52,833
No.

1123
01:04:54,375 --> 01:04:56,333
Okay, let's do this.

1124
01:04:58,166 --> 01:04:59,500
Long live India!

1125
01:05:11,083 --> 01:05:13,958
I'm feeling a bit feverish. So…

1126
01:05:14,958 --> 01:05:17,041
let's eat our dinner

1127
01:05:17,125 --> 01:05:18,750
and conclude this meeting.

1128
01:05:18,833 --> 01:05:20,166
Let me check what's wrong--

1129
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:21,333
Hey, you terrorist!

1130
01:05:21,708 --> 01:05:23,250
How dare you touch me!

1131
01:05:23,791 --> 01:05:24,833
What?

1132
01:05:25,916 --> 01:05:27,458
Wait, did I miss something?

1133
01:05:27,541 --> 01:05:29,000
I know why you are here.

1134
01:05:29,458 --> 01:05:31,166
You saw me drunk at that wedding.

1135
01:05:31,250 --> 01:05:35,250
So, you thought of coming to my place
to mark your territory.

1136
01:05:35,333 --> 01:05:37,000
Don't you dare touch me!

1137
01:05:37,083 --> 01:05:39,458
-What?
-Get out of my house right now!

1138
01:05:39,750 --> 01:05:41,375
The meeting--
Everything's canceled!

1139
01:05:41,458 --> 01:05:42,666
Leave right now. Get out!

1140
01:05:42,875 --> 01:05:44,125
Unbelievable.

1141
01:05:46,458 --> 01:05:50,166
If I knew you were so
judgmental and cheap,

1142
01:05:50,250 --> 01:05:51,791
I would've never come here!

1143
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:53,791
Bloody illiterate lout!

1144
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,500
No, don't look at me like that!

1145
01:05:56,291 --> 01:05:57,916
I got excited for no reason.

1146
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,833
You know what,
after talking to you,

1147
01:06:00,916 --> 01:06:03,000
I called up my friend
in Pakistan and told him.

1148
01:06:03,083 --> 01:06:06,750
But I swear, you turned out to be
a big disappointment, India Gupta!

1149
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:08,458
Are you done?

1150
01:06:08,625 --> 01:06:10,708
Now, get out!

1151
01:06:11,166 --> 01:06:12,583
Hey! The door's that way.

1152
01:06:12,666 --> 01:06:13,750
Hey! My bag's over there.

1153
01:06:13,833 --> 01:06:15,541
Well, then, get it!

1154
01:06:15,833 --> 01:06:17,000
It might contain RDX.

1155
01:06:18,250 --> 01:06:19,333
Out!

1156
01:06:21,375 --> 01:06:23,416
Enough of your drama!
Make yourself scarce!

1157
01:06:24,791 --> 01:06:26,875
So, I was telling you about Prem.

1158
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,916
Prem misinterpreted that.

1159
01:06:29,833 --> 01:06:31,083
Indoo.

1160
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Why are you standing outside?

1161
01:06:33,083 --> 01:06:33,958
Hello, Uncle!

1162
01:06:34,250 --> 01:06:36,458
Are you scared to be
all alone in the house?

1163
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:38,666
No, Uncle. I was just--

1164
01:06:38,750 --> 01:06:40,250
-Hello, Aunt.
-Hello, dear.

1165
01:06:40,333 --> 01:06:42,416
It's late in the night.
Don't stand outside. Okay?

1166
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:43,500
Go inside.

1167
01:06:43,625 --> 01:06:45,625
Your family is out of town.

1168
01:06:45,833 --> 01:06:47,458
It's not that big a deal.

1169
01:06:47,833 --> 01:06:50,208
If you don't mind, I'll stay over tonight.

1170
01:06:50,291 --> 01:06:52,250
Sure! Why not?

1171
01:06:52,666 --> 01:06:54,875
Don't try to be smart!

1172
01:06:55,250 --> 01:06:56,958
Come on.
We're going to the prayer meet.

1173
01:06:57,166 --> 01:06:58,708
-Yes.
-Indoo, you go inside.

1174
01:06:58,791 --> 01:06:59,708
-Yes.
-Yes, Aunt.

1175
01:06:59,791 --> 01:07:00,625
Go inside.

1176
01:07:00,708 --> 01:07:01,958
-Good night, Aunt.
-Good night, dear.

1177
01:07:02,041 --> 01:07:02,875
-Good night.
-Good night, Uncle.

1178
01:07:02,958 --> 01:07:04,041
-Let's go.
-Come on.

1179
01:07:05,541 --> 01:07:07,500
-What happened?
-You cannot leave.

1180
01:07:07,625 --> 01:07:08,625
Why not?

1181
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,625
Everyone's taking this road
to go to the prayer meet.

1182
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,875
I'll be sullied if anyone
sees you leave my house.

1183
01:07:17,208 --> 01:07:18,250
This is strange!

1184
01:07:19,583 --> 01:07:21,208
On one hand,
you called me a terrorist,

1185
01:07:21,458 --> 01:07:24,333
and on the other hand,
you want me to stay here all night

1186
01:07:24,416 --> 01:07:26,000
just to save yourself from humiliation.

1187
01:07:26,833 --> 01:07:27,833
Are you insane?

1188
01:07:27,916 --> 01:07:28,958
Step away from me!

1189
01:07:30,208 --> 01:07:31,833
There's nothing insane about this.

1190
01:07:32,291 --> 01:07:35,750
I cannot speak for you,
but this is the trend in our country.

1191
01:07:36,208 --> 01:07:37,666
We don't mind losing our life

1192
01:07:37,750 --> 01:07:39,958
but the reputation should be
protected at all costs.

1193
01:07:40,416 --> 01:07:45,000
You are going to sit over there
until the prayer meet concludes.

1194
01:07:45,083 --> 01:07:46,375
Do not make any noise.

1195
01:07:51,208 --> 01:07:52,958
Sir, we've found Ibrahim.

1196
01:07:53,166 --> 01:07:56,416
Constable Jagdish saw him
entering a building in Gaganpuri.

1197
01:07:57,625 --> 01:07:59,958
Let's go get him.

1198
01:08:10,666 --> 01:08:12,291
He went inside,
and hasn't come out yet.

1199
01:08:12,583 --> 01:08:14,375
We have surrounded the building, sir.

1200
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:15,916
We are sure he's hiding inside.

1201
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:17,458
Can we go inside?

1202
01:08:17,583 --> 01:08:19,083
-All clear, sir.
-We can go in.

1203
01:09:44,083 --> 01:09:46,666
Tell me the truth!
What is the name of your friend?

1204
01:09:47,416 --> 01:09:48,916
What's your plan?

1205
01:09:49,625 --> 01:09:50,583
Tell me!

1206
01:09:53,750 --> 01:09:56,000
Kill me if you want,
but I won't tell you anything.

1207
01:09:56,541 --> 01:09:58,500
You may continue thrashing him.

1208
01:09:59,125 --> 01:10:02,333
He'll either die or blurt out
his partner's whereabouts.

1209
01:10:02,791 --> 01:10:04,666
It will work either way.

1210
01:10:09,250 --> 01:10:11,041
By the way, what's your mission?

1211
01:10:12,333 --> 01:10:14,208
You watch a lot of Hindi movies, right?

1212
01:10:14,291 --> 01:10:15,166
Really?

1213
01:10:15,250 --> 01:10:18,708
You said you loved Bollywood
as well! So, what changed?

1214
01:10:18,791 --> 01:10:21,333
I told you that I like old Hindi films.

1215
01:10:21,583 --> 01:10:22,583
That's it.

1216
01:10:27,708 --> 01:10:31,750
Now I get why you liked
the movie <i>Kashmir Ki Kali</i>.

1217
01:10:32,666 --> 01:10:34,416
-Why?
-You want Kashmir!

1218
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:35,708
I'm not going to
let you take our Kashmir.

1219
01:10:35,791 --> 01:10:37,250
It belongs to us and it always will!

1220
01:10:37,333 --> 01:10:39,583
Excuse me!
I don't want your Kashmir.

1221
01:10:39,666 --> 01:10:41,041
Then, why are you here?

1222
01:10:41,791 --> 01:10:43,291
Have you planned another attack?

1223
01:10:44,750 --> 01:10:46,083
Listen, you dolt!

1224
01:10:46,916 --> 01:10:49,375
I have come to Mumbai
for my mom's treatment.

1225
01:10:49,583 --> 01:10:51,583
My parents flew back
to Pakistan two days ago.

1226
01:10:51,958 --> 01:10:53,916
My relatives asked me
to come to Ghaziabad.

1227
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,208
We have an ancestral
mansion here in Ghaziabad.

1228
01:10:56,708 --> 01:10:59,125
The house is filled with
oldies and I was getting bored.

1229
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:02,208
I thought of meeting new people in India.

1230
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:04,875
So, I made a profile on Dinder
and I swiped right on you.

1231
01:11:04,958 --> 01:11:07,041
Little did I know
that Indian girls are like you!

1232
01:11:07,750 --> 01:11:09,833
I'm not planning any attack here.

1233
01:11:10,125 --> 01:11:11,750
I am not a terrorist.

1234
01:11:12,208 --> 01:11:13,416
But you are a Pakistani.

1235
01:11:14,541 --> 01:11:15,791
Good Lord!

1236
01:11:20,958 --> 01:11:22,583
I want to use your bathroom.
Where is it?

1237
01:11:22,666 --> 01:11:24,958
No, you cannot go in there alone.
I'll go with you.

1238
01:11:27,083 --> 01:11:28,333
Or else, just wait for some time.

1239
01:11:28,833 --> 01:11:32,041
I'll ask the food delivery guy
to escort you to the bathroom.

1240
01:11:32,125 --> 01:11:34,041
There's no way
I'm letting you go in there alone.

1241
01:11:34,125 --> 01:11:35,416
God knows what you'll do in there.

1242
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:37,000
What is this nonsense?

1243
01:11:37,458 --> 01:11:39,416
I cannot leave.
I cannot use the bathroom.

1244
01:11:39,750 --> 01:11:42,958
They don't even deliver
food on time in your country.

1245
01:11:44,666 --> 01:11:45,666
There you go.

1246
01:11:46,041 --> 01:11:47,750
Luck is in your favor.

1247
01:11:56,916 --> 01:11:59,458
Get up. Quick!

1248
01:11:59,583 --> 01:12:00,458
-Come on!
-What's wrong?

1249
01:12:00,541 --> 01:12:01,375
-Just come with me!
-Hey!

1250
01:12:01,458 --> 01:12:03,750
Please come along.
Get inside.

1251
01:12:03,833 --> 01:12:05,541
Lock me up in the bathroom instead!

1252
01:12:05,625 --> 01:12:07,416
-Come on!
-Get in and don't say a word!

1253
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:15,416
Which horrible perfume are you wearing?

1254
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:16,375
Dikny.

1255
01:12:16,458 --> 01:12:17,291
Bikini?

1256
01:12:17,375 --> 01:12:20,666
Not Bikini, Dikny.
D-K-N-Y.

1257
01:12:22,125 --> 01:12:23,416
Bunty's not home.

1258
01:12:23,500 --> 01:12:24,666
I know that.

1259
01:12:24,750 --> 01:12:26,541
I'm here for you.

1260
01:12:26,791 --> 01:12:28,083
Why?

1261
01:12:28,166 --> 01:12:32,000
Bunty asked me to check in
on you as you are all alone at home.

1262
01:12:32,208 --> 01:12:34,208
-I'm fine. You may leave.
-Wait!

1263
01:12:34,625 --> 01:12:36,041
Let me make a call to Bunty.

1264
01:12:43,875 --> 01:12:44,708
Hello?

1265
01:12:45,208 --> 01:12:46,166
Bunty?

1266
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:47,875
I just stopped by your place.

1267
01:12:48,500 --> 01:12:51,291
Yes, your sister's fine.
She just looks a little scared.

1268
01:12:51,541 --> 01:12:54,166
The news about terrorists
have been making the rounds.

1269
01:12:54,583 --> 01:12:55,666
What?

1270
01:12:56,416 --> 01:12:57,583
Do you want me to stay here?

1271
01:12:57,916 --> 01:12:59,416
That's excellent!

1272
01:13:00,125 --> 01:13:01,458
Don't worry, bro!

1273
01:13:01,916 --> 01:13:04,791
No one can lay a finger on
Indoo Gupta as long as I'm here.

1274
01:13:05,375 --> 01:13:06,416
Alright, bye.

1275
01:13:06,958 --> 01:13:08,708
I don't need anyone's protection!

1276
01:13:08,791 --> 01:13:09,708
Get lost!

1277
01:13:09,791 --> 01:13:11,375
Are you sure?

1278
01:13:11,625 --> 01:13:13,125
This could spoil our friendship.

1279
01:13:13,375 --> 01:13:15,500
When were we ever friends?

1280
01:13:15,958 --> 01:13:18,000
I mean my friendship with Bunty.

1281
01:13:18,083 --> 01:13:20,416
That would be great!
Bunty will no longer be in bad company.

1282
01:13:20,500 --> 01:13:21,833
Indoo.

1283
01:13:22,041 --> 01:13:23,791
What happened?
Is there a problem?

1284
01:13:23,875 --> 01:13:25,625
Aunt, that's exactly
what I was asking her.

1285
01:13:25,833 --> 01:13:27,208
Bunty is a friend of mine.

1286
01:13:27,291 --> 01:13:28,500
Don't worry.

1287
01:13:28,708 --> 01:13:30,416
Go and attend the prayer meet.

1288
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,625
I'm here to protect Indoo Gupta.

1289
01:13:33,916 --> 01:13:35,000
See you, Indoo.

1290
01:13:35,125 --> 01:13:36,333
Don't worry.

1291
01:13:36,458 --> 01:13:39,083
Just inform Kittu if there's a problem.

1292
01:13:39,166 --> 01:13:40,125
He's like family.

1293
01:13:40,375 --> 01:13:42,333
Kittu, give my regards to your father.

1294
01:13:42,416 --> 01:13:43,750
Okay, Aunt. Bye.

1295
01:13:46,333 --> 01:13:47,375
Hey!

1296
01:13:48,166 --> 01:13:50,291
No one can touch you
as long as I'm here.

1297
01:13:52,250 --> 01:13:53,250
Stop right there!

1298
01:13:53,333 --> 01:13:54,291
Shit.

1299
01:13:55,083 --> 01:13:57,666
THE URGE TO PEE METER

1300
01:14:05,625 --> 01:14:07,750
<i>I have brought</i>

1301
01:14:07,833 --> 01:14:12,125
<i>My offerings to Goddess' abode</i>

1302
01:14:12,208 --> 01:14:15,833
<i>I have found peace</i>

1303
01:14:15,916 --> 01:14:19,250
Kittu still hasn't
returned from Indoo's place.

1304
01:14:19,791 --> 01:14:20,833
Yes.

1305
01:14:21,333 --> 01:14:24,000
This means she is cooperating with him.

1306
01:14:24,291 --> 01:14:26,458
I must say, Kittu is a lucky boy!

1307
01:14:26,833 --> 01:14:27,875
You're right.

1308
01:14:27,958 --> 01:14:29,666
He may return only in the morning.

1309
01:14:29,750 --> 01:14:31,375
He'll have a fantastic night!

1310
01:14:31,458 --> 01:14:33,708
<i>In Goddess' abode</i>

1311
01:14:33,791 --> 01:14:36,333
<i>Hail the Goddess</i>

1312
01:14:36,458 --> 01:14:37,458
Excuse me.

1313
01:14:37,791 --> 01:14:38,833
Ma'am!

1314
01:14:39,291 --> 01:14:40,916
Your son is nowhere to be seen.

1315
01:14:41,291 --> 01:14:43,791
-At the prayer meet.
-At the prayer meet.

1316
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:45,625
-Where is he?
-Where is he?

1317
01:14:48,125 --> 01:14:49,708
How long are you planning to sit here?

1318
01:14:49,958 --> 01:14:50,916
You tell me.

1319
01:14:51,166 --> 01:14:52,916
We could sit somewhere else as well.

1320
01:14:53,208 --> 01:14:54,833
We need not necessarily sit here.

1321
01:14:55,166 --> 01:14:57,958
I mean, how long do you
plan to stay in my house?

1322
01:14:58,041 --> 01:15:00,208
-I want to sleep.
-Then, let's go to your bedroom.

1323
01:15:00,291 --> 01:15:03,375
You can sleep while I… guard you.

1324
01:15:04,291 --> 01:15:05,750
Why do you want to do that?

1325
01:15:05,833 --> 01:15:07,541
Haven't you watched <i>Jab We Met</i>?

1326
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,291
A lone girl is looked upon
as an open treasure box.

1327
01:15:11,375 --> 01:15:12,500
I must protect you.

1328
01:15:14,333 --> 01:15:16,208
THE URGE TO PEE METER

1329
01:15:25,875 --> 01:15:27,125
Is Kartar in there?

1330
01:15:43,083 --> 01:15:44,625
Please come in, Aunt.

1331
01:15:44,833 --> 01:15:46,041
Welcome.

1332
01:15:51,083 --> 01:15:53,125
I've been looking
for you at the prayer meet,

1333
01:15:53,833 --> 01:15:55,458
and are you here with a girl!

1334
01:15:55,708 --> 01:15:58,125
Excuse me? What do you mean?

1335
01:15:58,416 --> 01:15:59,875
I didn't invite him in.

1336
01:16:00,625 --> 01:16:01,625
Of course!

1337
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,500
Aren't you a goody two shoes!

1338
01:16:04,125 --> 01:16:06,541
I'm sure he didn't break
the door and enter your house.

1339
01:16:07,083 --> 01:16:08,916
You were the one
who opened the door, right?

1340
01:16:11,541 --> 01:16:14,041
Why are you mum?
Tell your mother the truth!

1341
01:16:14,125 --> 01:16:15,500
What will he say?

1342
01:16:15,916 --> 01:16:17,333
Now I'll do the talking.

1343
01:16:17,583 --> 01:16:19,291
I'll let everyone in the colony know

1344
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:23,500
that you are inviting boys over
in your family's absence!

1345
01:16:24,333 --> 01:16:26,958
Aunt, I'm being respectful towards you.

1346
01:16:27,041 --> 01:16:28,833
But that doesn't mean
you can keep talking nonsense.

1347
01:16:28,916 --> 01:16:33,750
Listen, it's because of girls like you
that other girls are seen in a bad light.

1348
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
Instead of getting
married at marriageable age…

1349
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:41,125
you invite young boys over
and take advantage of them.

1350
01:16:43,583 --> 01:16:44,625
Oh, my God!

1351
01:16:45,041 --> 01:16:46,833
The whole family is despicable.

1352
01:16:48,791 --> 01:16:51,375
You've said enough.
Now you will listen to me.

1353
01:16:52,041 --> 01:16:56,583
The truth is, your son Kartar has
been hitting on me since Alka's wedding.

1354
01:16:56,833 --> 01:16:59,500
He said some things to my brother
and barged into my house!

1355
01:16:59,583 --> 01:17:04,041
I've been asking him to leave
from here, but he just wouldn't budge!

1356
01:17:04,416 --> 01:17:05,833
He says he will protect me.

1357
01:17:06,083 --> 01:17:07,125
He told Mrs. Sharma,

1358
01:17:07,208 --> 01:17:10,208
"Go to the prayer meet.
I'm here to protect Indoo."

1359
01:17:10,375 --> 01:17:12,375
Who gave him
the responsibility to protect me?

1360
01:17:12,750 --> 01:17:15,875
I'll smack this scoundrel
so hard that he will land in prison!

1361
01:17:16,125 --> 01:17:20,666
And if I'm proven right, I'll make
him parade naked through the streets!

1362
01:17:25,833 --> 01:17:26,916
Apologize to Indoo.

1363
01:17:32,750 --> 01:17:33,750
Come on.

1364
01:17:34,291 --> 01:17:35,500
Hey, Pran!

1365
01:17:36,083 --> 01:17:37,500
Pran, let's go!

1366
01:17:38,083 --> 01:17:40,250
I was offering my prayers to Goddess.

1367
01:17:41,875 --> 01:17:42,833
Out!

1368
01:17:43,041 --> 01:17:45,583
I said, get out of my house!

1369
01:17:47,250 --> 01:17:50,833
If I see you anywhere around
my house, I'll file a case against you!

1370
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:53,708
I have told you not to be
in your father's company.

1371
01:17:54,083 --> 01:17:57,041
You're growing up to be just like him!

1372
01:17:58,041 --> 01:17:59,500
Do you have some work with me?

1373
01:18:00,083 --> 01:18:01,166
No, dear.

1374
01:18:01,500 --> 01:18:04,791
We heard that he was at your place--

1375
01:18:04,875 --> 01:18:06,750
So, we came here
to teach him a lesson.

1376
01:18:06,833 --> 01:18:08,416
-What did you come here for?
-Uncle!

1377
01:18:08,875 --> 01:18:11,583
If you touch me again, I'll disclose
all your secrets to your wife.

1378
01:18:11,666 --> 01:18:13,291
Have you lost your mind?

1379
01:18:13,416 --> 01:18:17,166
Indoo, we just came here
to tell you to be careful.

1380
01:18:17,250 --> 01:18:18,583
-Let's go.
-All hail the Goddess!

1381
01:18:18,666 --> 01:18:19,666
-Dear--
-Let's go.

1382
01:18:20,208 --> 01:18:21,041
Come on.

1383
01:18:21,125 --> 01:18:21,958
Dear--

1384
01:18:22,041 --> 01:18:23,416
-Come on.
-Take him away!

1385
01:18:27,625 --> 01:18:29,625
THE URGE TO PEE METER

1386
01:18:39,583 --> 01:18:42,166
What are you…

1387
01:18:44,416 --> 01:18:45,458
Get down.

1388
01:18:45,833 --> 01:18:46,916
I said, get down.

1389
01:18:55,541 --> 01:18:57,916
Come on, get out of this room.

1390
01:18:58,791 --> 01:19:00,833
Let me either go to the bathroom or--

1391
01:19:04,750 --> 01:19:06,041
What are you doing?

1392
01:19:06,125 --> 01:19:07,291
I'm protecting myself.

1393
01:19:07,375 --> 01:19:08,791
I'm not even going to touch you.

1394
01:19:08,875 --> 01:19:10,333
I won't let you!

1395
01:19:10,541 --> 01:19:11,791
What do you think I am?

1396
01:19:12,375 --> 01:19:14,833
I'm a true Indian
and an honest human being.

1397
01:19:15,333 --> 01:19:17,833
Unlike your country,
our country isn't filled with filth.

1398
01:19:17,916 --> 01:19:19,375
Is there filth only in Pakistani?

1399
01:19:19,583 --> 01:19:21,250
Dawood wasn't from India, right?

1400
01:19:21,708 --> 01:19:24,291
Crows are always black,
be it India or Pakistan.

1401
01:19:24,375 --> 01:19:26,000
They are black in India for sure,

1402
01:19:26,083 --> 01:19:29,375
but you guys must
kidnap crows and turn them black.

1403
01:19:30,458 --> 01:19:32,875
The parents in our country
want their children to be

1404
01:19:33,041 --> 01:19:35,833
IAS officers, doctors, engineers,
scientists, etc. when they grow up.

1405
01:19:36,125 --> 01:19:37,125
I'm sure that in your country

1406
01:19:37,208 --> 01:19:41,125
parents celebrate the
birth of a new Jihadi.

1407
01:19:41,250 --> 01:19:42,583
They must be placing bets.

1408
01:19:42,791 --> 01:19:46,208
The father must be saying, "My son
will cause five blasts and 15 hijackings."

1409
01:19:46,416 --> 01:19:49,166
And the mother must be
saying that he'll do better--

1410
01:19:49,291 --> 01:19:50,500
What are you doing?

1411
01:19:50,583 --> 01:19:52,125
I'm feeling hot.

1412
01:19:52,583 --> 01:19:53,791
Put it over there!

1413
01:19:55,833 --> 01:19:59,083
Your country has more
terrorist camps than schools and colleges.

1414
01:19:59,166 --> 01:20:00,416
Why did I come here?

1415
01:20:00,500 --> 01:20:02,875
The urge to pee is so strong
that my brain has stopped working.

1416
01:20:02,958 --> 01:20:04,791
Please let me go to the bathroom!

1417
01:20:04,875 --> 01:20:07,166
-Please--
-Just remain seated! Be quiet!

1418
01:20:09,208 --> 01:20:11,208
All of you should
be punished like this.

1419
01:20:11,291 --> 01:20:13,916
You should all be made to sit
in a line and not be allowed to pee.

1420
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,750
What harm have I caused you?
Why are you so resentful?

1421
01:20:16,875 --> 01:20:19,041
What's there to like about your country?

1422
01:20:19,250 --> 01:20:21,333
Tell me one
good thing about your country.

1423
01:20:21,416 --> 01:20:22,583
-Go on.
-Okay.

1424
01:20:24,583 --> 01:20:25,666
Tell me.

1425
01:20:29,583 --> 01:20:31,000
You've got nothing.

1426
01:20:32,375 --> 01:20:33,666
Our historical cricket team.

1427
01:20:34,208 --> 01:20:36,416
-We have such amazing--
-Cut the crap!

1428
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:39,000
We have players
like Sachin, Dhoni and Sourav.

1429
01:20:39,125 --> 01:20:40,458
Virat is also in form these days.

1430
01:20:40,541 --> 01:20:43,250
We have Afridi,
Wasim Akram and Imran Khan.

1431
01:20:43,750 --> 01:20:48,083
By the way, film actresses of
your country are crazy about our players.

1432
01:20:48,166 --> 01:20:51,166
That doesn't mean your
players are better than ours.

1433
01:20:51,291 --> 01:20:53,750
You guys have lost every
world cup match against us.

1434
01:20:55,583 --> 01:20:57,208
India is far better than your country.

1435
01:20:57,750 --> 01:20:59,583
Your country is no match for mine.

1436
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,333
You guys cannot tolerate
that India is so far ahead of you.

1437
01:21:02,416 --> 01:21:04,208
That's why you keep
coming here to trouble us.

1438
01:21:04,291 --> 01:21:05,583
I cannot hold it in anymore!

1439
01:21:05,666 --> 01:21:08,791
Please tell me where the bathroom is,
otherwise there will be a big problem.

1440
01:21:10,208 --> 01:21:11,333
Good Lord!
That must be the delivery boy.

1441
01:21:11,416 --> 01:21:13,041
Please get the door.

1442
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:14,333
Stay here.

1443
01:21:14,416 --> 01:21:16,000
Hurry up, or else I'll pee right here!

1444
01:21:17,333 --> 01:21:18,416
Hurry!

1445
01:21:18,958 --> 01:21:20,000
Hey!

1446
01:21:20,208 --> 01:21:21,291
Put your feet down.

1447
01:21:30,833 --> 01:21:31,916
Your order, ma'am.

1448
01:21:32,916 --> 01:21:33,875
It's him.

1449
01:21:34,041 --> 01:21:35,708
Just come with me to the bathroom.

1450
01:21:35,791 --> 01:21:37,250
-Bathroom?
-Yes, the bathroom.

1451
01:21:37,333 --> 01:21:38,875
India, where's the washroom?

1452
01:21:38,958 --> 01:21:40,500
Right there.
The door to your left.

1453
01:21:40,583 --> 01:21:42,125
-But, sir--
-Let's go!

1454
01:21:42,208 --> 01:21:44,000
I'm not kidnapping you.

1455
01:21:44,083 --> 01:21:46,083
Just keep an eye on me
until I am done peeing.

1456
01:21:46,166 --> 01:21:47,458
-I don't want to watch you pee!
-Get in!

1457
01:21:47,541 --> 01:21:48,458
Pick it up!

1458
01:21:48,541 --> 01:21:49,416
You latecomer!

1459
01:21:49,500 --> 01:21:52,333
You deliver the order late,
and then you refuse to compensate!

1460
01:21:52,458 --> 01:21:54,083
Just stand here
and keep an eye on that Pakistani.

1461
01:21:54,166 --> 01:21:56,041
Make sure he's just peeing
and not doing anything else in there.

1462
01:21:56,125 --> 01:21:57,125
Pakistani?

1463
01:21:57,541 --> 01:21:59,416
Now you don't get started on it!

1464
01:22:00,166 --> 01:22:01,458
What a disastrous night!

1465
01:22:02,875 --> 01:22:04,375
I feel so much lighter now.

1466
01:22:04,833 --> 01:22:07,750
But what happens
when you watch a Pakistani pee?

1467
01:22:08,083 --> 01:22:11,125
The woman thinks
every Pakistani is a terrorist.

1468
01:22:11,541 --> 01:22:14,791
She suspects that I'll use the excuse
to pee to plant a bomb in her house.

1469
01:22:14,875 --> 01:22:16,333
Anyone would suspect that!

1470
01:22:16,541 --> 01:22:18,083
This is what you guys do.

1471
01:22:18,291 --> 01:22:20,583
You go to hotels and start
gunning down innocent people.

1472
01:22:20,750 --> 01:22:24,041
Be it restaurants, railway stations,
or hospitals, you guys spared no place!

1473
01:22:24,208 --> 01:22:25,625
Why shouldn't we doubt you guys?

1474
01:22:25,708 --> 01:22:27,166
What do you mean?

1475
01:22:27,333 --> 01:22:29,708
How many times do I
have to tell you I'm not a terrorist?

1476
01:22:29,791 --> 01:22:32,666
Every thief claims to be
innocent after committing a theft.

1477
01:22:32,791 --> 01:22:34,416
Don't get me started on theft.

1478
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:35,916
You Indians are thieves.

1479
01:22:36,416 --> 01:22:39,916
You guys steal our songs,
make remixes and release them!

1480
01:22:40,416 --> 01:22:41,875
You guys are frauds--

1481
01:22:41,958 --> 01:22:42,916
-Hey!
-Hey!

1482
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,166
You guys plagiarize songs
from all over the world!

1483
01:22:47,666 --> 01:22:49,083
No country is ever perfect.

1484
01:22:49,166 --> 01:22:50,416
You have to make it perfect.

1485
01:22:50,916 --> 01:22:53,125
This is what has been
said in the movie <i>Rang De Basanti</i>.

1486
01:22:53,208 --> 01:22:54,416
-Didn't you watch it?
-There you go!

1487
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:56,333
She uses a movie
reference for everything.

1488
01:22:56,625 --> 01:22:58,416
You mask your flaws
with movie references!

1489
01:22:58,666 --> 01:23:00,333
Your country isn't perfect either.

1490
01:23:00,416 --> 01:23:02,541
India is still far better than Pakistan.

1491
01:23:02,625 --> 01:23:03,500
Excuse me!

1492
01:23:03,625 --> 01:23:06,041
India isn't better than Pakistan
just because you claim so.

1493
01:23:06,125 --> 01:23:07,500
Why do we need to compare them anyway?

1494
01:23:07,625 --> 01:23:09,875
Every country has its
advantages and disadvantages.

1495
01:23:10,083 --> 01:23:14,166
If you think Pakistan is not a good
country then, India isn't good either.

1496
01:23:14,666 --> 01:23:19,125
Don't get me started on the
increasing crime against women here.

1497
01:23:19,708 --> 01:23:21,000
And religious warfare!

1498
01:23:21,291 --> 01:23:23,583
All of you are frauds and you
call yourselves "tolerant."

1499
01:23:23,666 --> 01:23:26,041
Also, there are fights between states!

1500
01:23:26,125 --> 01:23:27,666
The people of Mumbai have a
problem with the people of Delhi.

1501
01:23:27,750 --> 01:23:29,083
And some of them have a problem
with the people of Bihar.

1502
01:23:29,166 --> 01:23:30,125
-No--
-Shut up!

1503
01:23:30,208 --> 01:23:32,541
And don't get me
started about South India!

1504
01:23:33,458 --> 01:23:35,750
One country has been
divided into 25 mini countries.

1505
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,333
Get your facts right
about your country

1506
01:23:39,416 --> 01:23:41,083
before you criticize other countries.

1507
01:23:41,416 --> 01:23:44,625
I can say a lot of things
but I don't want to argue with you.

1508
01:23:44,708 --> 01:23:47,083
You'll attack, I'll counter
and he will also join in.

1509
01:23:47,208 --> 01:23:48,375
-It will go on forever.
-Fine.

1510
01:23:48,458 --> 01:23:49,666
We won't say anything.

1511
01:23:50,125 --> 01:23:52,625
Come on. Tell us.
Which country is better?

1512
01:23:52,708 --> 01:23:55,458
-India or Pakistan?
-Who is he to judge?

1513
01:23:55,875 --> 01:23:57,208
He is an Indian.

1514
01:23:57,458 --> 01:23:59,625
And Indians judge everyone.

1515
01:23:59,916 --> 01:24:02,541
No one is as judgmental as we are.

1516
01:24:02,625 --> 01:24:03,750
I can see that.

1517
01:24:03,833 --> 01:24:04,791
Stop grinning!

1518
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:09,000
Think about your answer
while you keep an eye on him.

1519
01:24:09,375 --> 01:24:11,583
-I'll be right back.
-Where are you going?

1520
01:24:12,500 --> 01:24:15,000
You kept whining about
how badly you wanted to pee.

1521
01:24:15,166 --> 01:24:17,666
I'm also a mere mortal
who wishes to relieve herself.

1522
01:24:18,750 --> 01:24:20,875
I'm a girl.
I cannot express it so candidly.

1523
01:24:21,916 --> 01:24:22,916
Keep an eye on him.

1524
01:24:23,375 --> 01:24:24,458
I'll be right back.

1525
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,500
Hey, where did the Pakistani go?

1526
01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:49,291
He left.

1527
01:24:49,416 --> 01:24:50,333
What?

1528
01:24:50,458 --> 01:24:51,416
Yes.

1529
01:24:51,625 --> 01:24:52,666
Shit!

1530
01:24:55,416 --> 01:24:57,291
I don't see anyone around.

1531
01:24:57,750 --> 01:24:59,833
Well, good riddance!

1532
01:25:00,083 --> 01:25:01,458
You too should leave now.

1533
01:25:01,583 --> 01:25:04,041
Hold on! Let me check
if anyone's out there.

1534
01:25:06,583 --> 01:25:07,583
Wait.

1535
01:25:07,958 --> 01:25:10,000
Mr. Bedi and his family
are walking past the door.

1536
01:25:30,625 --> 01:25:31,708
Yes, Sonal?

1537
01:25:32,041 --> 01:25:34,000
Hey, Indoo. Is everything okay?

1538
01:25:34,458 --> 01:25:35,625
It seems like it.

1539
01:25:35,791 --> 01:25:36,916
<i>What do you mean?</i>

1540
01:25:37,208 --> 01:25:38,416
Where's that Pakistani?

1541
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:39,583
He just left.

1542
01:25:39,666 --> 01:25:41,375
<i>Oh, good riddance!</i>

1543
01:25:41,458 --> 01:25:43,833
The other guy is still here.

1544
01:25:43,916 --> 01:25:46,000
What? Who is that?

1545
01:25:46,416 --> 01:25:48,916
You invited only one guy from Dinder.

1546
01:25:49,166 --> 01:25:50,291
<i>This is cheating.</i>

1547
01:25:50,375 --> 01:25:52,916
This guy is from Gomato and not Dinder.

1548
01:25:54,500 --> 01:25:55,666
From Gomato?

1549
01:25:55,791 --> 01:25:57,625
Do they supply men as well?

1550
01:25:58,458 --> 01:26:02,416
I've been a fool all this while
to be ordering just food from them.

1551
01:26:05,125 --> 01:26:06,958
Listen, I'll talk to you later.

1552
01:26:07,041 --> 01:26:08,541
Let me handle this situation first.

1553
01:26:09,166 --> 01:26:10,583
Okay, bye.

1554
01:26:16,875 --> 01:26:20,291
Have you brought me to Gurugram
for just one round?

1555
01:26:20,791 --> 01:26:22,250
Why are you snoring the night away?

1556
01:26:23,916 --> 01:26:27,583
Hey, mister! This isn't
a museum for you to take a tour.

1557
01:26:27,750 --> 01:26:29,541
Let's see if the path is clear.

1558
01:26:29,625 --> 01:26:30,625
Come on.

1559
01:27:04,958 --> 01:27:06,250
Jagdish Kumar.

1560
01:27:06,500 --> 01:27:08,708
Jagdish Kumar is on
his way with your order.

1561
01:27:08,958 --> 01:27:10,041
Done.

1562
01:27:16,541 --> 01:27:18,458
Sir! Sir, wake up.

1563
01:27:18,791 --> 01:27:19,875
Please wake up, sir!

1564
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:20,958
Who is it?

1565
01:27:21,208 --> 01:27:23,250
Sir, there is a dead body over there.

1566
01:27:23,375 --> 01:27:25,750
And I think the killer has
entered that house over there.

1567
01:27:26,125 --> 01:27:27,125
No.

1568
01:27:27,583 --> 01:27:29,500
-But--
-Get me the evidence.

1569
01:27:29,958 --> 01:27:32,083
And then report it
to the police station.

1570
01:27:32,333 --> 01:27:34,416
-Go.
-Sir, you don't get it.

1571
01:27:34,916 --> 01:27:36,000
India is in danger.

1572
01:27:36,250 --> 01:27:39,375
India has been
in danger since the time

1573
01:27:40,083 --> 01:27:42,375
partition took place.

1574
01:27:42,958 --> 01:27:44,791
Did you just realize that?

1575
01:27:44,958 --> 01:27:46,708
Where are you from?

1576
01:27:46,791 --> 01:27:48,333
I'm from Pakistan, sir.

1577
01:27:48,416 --> 01:27:49,750
Why don't you understand?

1578
01:27:49,833 --> 01:27:52,416
That girl named India is in danger, sir.

1579
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:54,958
Hey, stop calling it a girl!

1580
01:27:55,500 --> 01:27:56,791
Show some respect.

1581
01:27:57,125 --> 01:28:01,166
India… is our motherland.

1582
01:28:21,416 --> 01:28:24,125
He's been trained well, sir.

1583
01:28:24,833 --> 01:28:27,083
He'll rather die than talk.

1584
01:28:29,291 --> 01:28:30,166
Then kill him.

1585
01:28:30,916 --> 01:28:33,125
-We don't need him to talk.
-What do you mean?

1586
01:28:33,208 --> 01:28:35,000
IB has sent a picture of the other guy.

1587
01:28:36,625 --> 01:28:37,750
Let me take a look, sir.

1588
01:28:43,416 --> 01:28:45,875
Send his picture to all the
police stations and news channels.

1589
01:28:46,625 --> 01:28:48,000
We found his partner in this area.

1590
01:28:50,041 --> 01:28:51,166
He must be somewhere close.

1591
01:29:04,333 --> 01:29:06,291
-<i>Glory be to the Goddess!</i>
-<i>Glory be to the Goddess!</i>

1592
01:29:06,375 --> 01:29:08,416
-<i>The one who rides the lion</i>
-<i>Glory be to the Goddess!</i>

1593
01:29:08,500 --> 01:29:10,416
-<i>The one who blesses all</i>
-<i>Glory be to the Goddess!</i>

1594
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:11,833
<i>The one from the mountains</i>

1595
01:29:11,916 --> 01:29:12,875
Greetings, sir!

1596
01:29:12,958 --> 01:29:14,833
-<i>Say it with me</i>
-<i>Hail the Goddess!</i>

1597
01:29:14,916 --> 01:29:16,833
-<i>Glory be to the Goddess!</i>
-<i>Glory be to the Goddess!</i>

1598
01:29:16,958 --> 01:29:18,208
Listen, sir.

1599
01:29:18,291 --> 01:29:21,208
-That--
-Sing along! Glory be to the Goddess!

1600
01:29:21,291 --> 01:29:22,625
Glory be to the Goddess!

1601
01:29:22,750 --> 01:29:24,958
Glory be to the Goddess!

1602
01:29:25,541 --> 01:29:28,583
Glory be to the Goddess!

1603
01:29:28,666 --> 01:29:31,041
Wait. Let me check
if there's anyone outside.

1604
01:29:31,708 --> 01:29:32,666
You?

1605
01:29:33,416 --> 01:29:34,625
Why did you come back?

1606
01:29:35,166 --> 01:29:37,166
I won't let you insult my country
and have the final say.

1607
01:29:37,250 --> 01:29:38,416
I've come to give you a fitting reply.

1608
01:29:38,500 --> 01:29:39,833
I don't want it.

1609
01:29:39,916 --> 01:29:41,958
Please leave, or else
my image will be tarnished.

1610
01:29:42,416 --> 01:29:45,166
I won't leave. Let me in.

1611
01:29:45,500 --> 01:29:47,875
Sure. That's the reason
you have come back.

1612
01:29:47,958 --> 01:29:49,333
You want to get in at any cost.

1613
01:29:49,416 --> 01:29:51,375
But I'm not foolish!
Do you understand?

1614
01:29:51,791 --> 01:29:53,333
I won't let you in. Go away!

1615
01:29:53,416 --> 01:29:56,541
Alright. I'll sit outside
and tell all the passersby that

1616
01:29:56,625 --> 01:29:58,291
you call boys over
for one-night stands

1617
01:29:58,375 --> 01:29:59,875
when your family's not home.

1618
01:29:59,958 --> 01:30:02,833
Why do you want to ruin my life?

1619
01:30:05,666 --> 01:30:06,500
What is it?

1620
01:30:06,583 --> 01:30:08,125
Have your final say
and get out of here.

1621
01:30:08,208 --> 01:30:09,208
You get out of here.

1622
01:30:09,291 --> 01:30:10,208
Why is he still here?

1623
01:30:10,291 --> 01:30:11,916
Do you want to have a
one-night stand with him?

1624
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:13,958
You have such a cheap mentality!

1625
01:30:14,500 --> 01:30:16,791
He is an Indian.
He isn't like you guys.

1626
01:30:16,875 --> 01:30:19,458
He's here only to protect me from you.

1627
01:30:19,541 --> 01:30:21,125
-Right, bro?
-Yes, of course.

1628
01:30:21,208 --> 01:30:22,833
Hey! Don't you get close to her.

1629
01:30:22,916 --> 01:30:23,833
-Shut up!
-Hear that?

1630
01:30:23,916 --> 01:30:25,000
What's wrong with you?

1631
01:30:26,916 --> 01:30:28,000
India, listen to me.

1632
01:30:28,458 --> 01:30:30,583
I'm a Pakistani,
but I'm not your enemy.

1633
01:30:30,666 --> 01:30:31,833
I'm actually your friend.

1634
01:30:31,916 --> 01:30:34,125
The real enemy is someone else.

1635
01:30:34,208 --> 01:30:35,666
Excuse me!

1636
01:30:36,375 --> 01:30:37,708
I understand English.

1637
01:30:38,125 --> 01:30:39,125
Did you hear that?

1638
01:30:39,583 --> 01:30:41,208
My country has progressed so much.

1639
01:30:41,375 --> 01:30:42,375
He also knows English.

1640
01:30:42,458 --> 01:30:44,791
Did you think he wouldn't
understand if you talk in English?

1641
01:30:44,958 --> 01:30:48,958
No matter how hard you try,
I will not let your plan succeed.

1642
01:30:49,208 --> 01:30:51,000
My plan?
What plan do I have?

1643
01:30:51,125 --> 01:30:54,708
You plan to mark your territory
on the pretext of befriending me.

1644
01:30:54,833 --> 01:30:55,916
What nonsense!

1645
01:30:56,083 --> 01:30:59,041
Ms. India, you hold no special treasure.

1646
01:30:59,291 --> 01:31:00,625
Everyone has the same goodies.

1647
01:31:01,125 --> 01:31:02,208
Ridiculous.

1648
01:31:03,583 --> 01:31:05,416
I was right about you guys.

1649
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,666
All boys are the same.

1650
01:31:09,291 --> 01:31:12,208
I'm sure there's book that you guys
read before you come down to earth.

1651
01:31:12,291 --> 01:31:14,125
Don't worry, ma'am.
I'll throw him out.

1652
01:31:14,208 --> 01:31:15,083
-Come on!
-Yes, do it!

1653
01:31:15,166 --> 01:31:16,750
Who the hell
are you to throw me out?

1654
01:31:16,833 --> 01:31:17,666
Listen to me, India--

1655
01:31:17,750 --> 01:31:19,291
Don't act smart with me!
You barged in here!

1656
01:31:19,375 --> 01:31:22,500
You're the one who's uninvited.
I know who you are. Understood?

1657
01:31:22,583 --> 01:31:24,875
Oh, I see! You know who I am!

1658
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:26,875
Leave before I thrash you.

1659
01:31:27,625 --> 01:31:29,708
-Will you hit me?
-You…

1660
01:31:33,708 --> 01:31:35,000
Stop it!

1661
01:31:35,083 --> 01:31:36,583
Let him go.
Are you both crazy?

1662
01:31:36,666 --> 01:31:37,500
What are you doing?

1663
01:31:37,583 --> 01:31:39,666
Why does this
have to happen in my house?

1664
01:31:40,333 --> 01:31:41,625
You'll break the mirror!

1665
01:32:08,875 --> 01:32:11,208
Oh, shit! Is he dead?

1666
01:32:17,041 --> 01:32:19,041
He's breathing.
He's just unconscious.

1667
01:32:19,291 --> 01:32:20,916
What have I done!

1668
01:32:21,291 --> 01:32:22,541
You did the right thing, ma'am.

1669
01:32:22,666 --> 01:32:24,458
This is what these Pakistanis deserve.

1670
01:32:25,125 --> 01:32:26,500
Please help me out.

1671
01:32:27,041 --> 01:32:28,583
I've had enough drama for the day.

1672
01:32:29,208 --> 01:32:30,125
To hell with my image.

1673
01:32:30,208 --> 01:32:32,208
Just take him along and
dump him somewhere.

1674
01:32:32,291 --> 01:32:33,291
You should leave now.

1675
01:32:33,416 --> 01:32:35,125
I'll give you some cash.
Take an auto rickshaw.

1676
01:32:35,208 --> 01:32:37,041
Can I use the washroom before I leave?

1677
01:32:37,125 --> 01:32:38,458
Yes, but make it quick.

1678
01:32:38,666 --> 01:32:40,041
I'll be right back. Thank you.

1679
01:32:51,791 --> 01:32:53,083
{\an8}<i>Look at this face carefully.</i>

1680
01:32:53,416 --> 01:32:55,250
<i>He is a wanted terrorist.</i>

1681
01:32:55,958 --> 01:32:59,000
{\an8}<i>According to the police,</i>
<i>he's hiding somewhere in Ghaziabad.</i>

1682
01:32:59,291 --> 01:33:02,083
{\an8}<i>The police force is</i>
<i>looking for him all across the city.</i>

1683
01:33:02,375 --> 01:33:04,750
{\an8}<i>If you've seen him anywhere,</i>

1684
01:33:04,958 --> 01:33:08,583
{\an8}<i>call the police help line immediately.</i>

1685
01:33:09,750 --> 01:33:13,083
<i>That's what you call a double whammy.</i>

1686
01:33:13,708 --> 01:33:17,875
<i>I tried to be smart,</i>
<i>but I've dug my own grave.</i>

1687
01:33:18,291 --> 01:33:19,791
<i>What will I do now?</i>

1688
01:33:20,416 --> 01:33:23,166
<i>We still don't know</i>
<i>what he intends to do.</i>

1689
01:33:23,416 --> 01:33:28,083
<i>But you should help the police in</i>
<i>keeping your city and your country safe.</i>

1690
01:33:34,041 --> 01:33:37,166
<i>The Ghaziabad police finally managed</i>

1691
01:33:37,250 --> 01:33:39,833
<i>to get a picture</i>
<i>of this dangerous terrorist.</i>

1692
01:33:40,125 --> 01:33:44,500
<i>He is said to be hiding</i>
<i>somewhere in Ghaziabad.</i>

1693
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,250
<i>Take a close look at his face.</i>

1694
01:33:47,333 --> 01:33:52,000
<i>This innocent looking man,</i>
<i>is in fact, very dangerous.</i>

1695
01:33:52,083 --> 01:33:57,833
<i>According to the police,</i>
<i>he could be hiding in a residential area.</i>

1696
01:33:57,916 --> 01:34:00,458
<i>His partner has already been arrested.</i>

1697
01:34:00,541 --> 01:34:04,208
<i>Ghaziabad police is interrogating him.</i>

1698
01:34:05,166 --> 01:34:09,583
<i>-Look at the image shown on this--</i>
-Thank you.

1699
01:34:10,833 --> 01:34:13,833
<i>And if you think he is--</i>

1700
01:34:17,708 --> 01:34:19,625
Perhaps that idiot found out who I was.

1701
01:34:20,291 --> 01:34:22,083
That's why he
came back here to save you.

1702
01:34:22,750 --> 01:34:24,208
But you Indians are big fools.

1703
01:34:24,583 --> 01:34:25,875
You hit him in the head.

1704
01:34:26,541 --> 01:34:29,541
I was looking for a place to hide,
and you guys dragged me inside.

1705
01:34:29,958 --> 01:34:31,416
I didn't even have to use my gun.

1706
01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:32,500
Your order, ma'am.

1707
01:34:32,625 --> 01:34:33,458
It's him.

1708
01:34:33,541 --> 01:34:34,666
Just come with me to the bathroom.

1709
01:34:34,750 --> 01:34:35,750
Bathroom?

1710
01:34:35,958 --> 01:34:38,250
When you asked me to leave,

1711
01:34:38,458 --> 01:34:40,333
he showed up just before
I could take my gun out.

1712
01:34:42,458 --> 01:34:43,333
You?

1713
01:34:43,416 --> 01:34:44,541
Why did you come back?

1714
01:34:44,625 --> 01:34:46,541
I won't let you insult my country
and have the final say.

1715
01:34:46,625 --> 01:34:47,583
I've come to give you a fitting reply.

1716
01:34:47,666 --> 01:34:50,083
I ended up benefiting from your fight.

1717
01:34:51,875 --> 01:34:53,000
This is nothing new.

1718
01:34:53,083 --> 01:34:56,000
India and Pakistan have been
fighting ever since the partition,

1719
01:34:56,083 --> 01:34:57,666
and a third party always benefits from it.

1720
01:34:58,125 --> 01:35:00,458
Forget about you two,
my own guy betrayed me.

1721
01:35:00,708 --> 01:35:03,541
He had set up a shop at Patel
Nagar junction. He sold me out.

1722
01:35:03,958 --> 01:35:05,625
He tricked me into coming to Ghaziabad--

1723
01:35:05,708 --> 01:35:06,666
Hey!

1724
01:35:19,500 --> 01:35:20,416
Sir.

1725
01:35:21,083 --> 01:35:22,541
We have searched almost everywhere.

1726
01:35:23,333 --> 01:35:24,541
No one has seen him.

1727
01:35:25,083 --> 01:35:27,291
We're yet to comb through
Patel Nagar and Kavi Nagar.

1728
01:35:27,375 --> 01:35:28,500
Let's go to Patel Nagar.

1729
01:35:28,958 --> 01:35:30,208
There's where we caught Ibrahim.

1730
01:35:35,541 --> 01:35:38,583
Baldev isn't interested in doing his job.

1731
01:35:38,708 --> 01:35:40,041
He's forcing me to take his case.

1732
01:35:40,916 --> 01:35:41,791
What case?

1733
01:35:42,250 --> 01:35:43,833
His friend owns a hotel.

1734
01:35:44,416 --> 01:35:48,166
His friend has lodged a complaint that
his delivery guy went to deliver food,

1735
01:35:48,875 --> 01:35:49,791
but didn't come back.

1736
01:35:50,083 --> 01:35:52,791
The number with which that
order was made is also switched off.

1737
01:35:53,500 --> 01:35:55,625
It's not even been
24 hours since he went missing.

1738
01:35:56,541 --> 01:35:57,583
What's the delivery area?

1739
01:35:57,916 --> 01:35:58,833
Kavi Nagar.

1740
01:36:07,666 --> 01:36:08,833
Sir, wait!

1741
01:36:08,916 --> 01:36:10,375
Don't leave me behind, Sir!

1742
01:37:38,083 --> 01:37:39,041
Listen up, girl!

1743
01:37:39,958 --> 01:37:42,000
If you don't show yourself
in the next ten seconds,

1744
01:37:42,500 --> 01:37:45,208
I'll riddle this
Pakistani's body with bullets.

1745
01:37:46,250 --> 01:37:47,333
Show yourself!

1746
01:37:51,083 --> 01:37:52,583
What kind of a person are you?

1747
01:37:53,500 --> 01:37:57,541
You criticized him
and yet he came back to save you.

1748
01:37:57,750 --> 01:37:59,583
Now when I am about to shoot him,

1749
01:38:00,583 --> 01:38:01,833
you are hiding inside!

1750
01:38:06,333 --> 01:38:07,916
You should feel ashamed…

1751
01:38:08,708 --> 01:38:09,958
you Indians!

1752
01:38:10,333 --> 01:38:11,750
Bloody cowards.

1753
01:38:11,833 --> 01:38:13,625
Who are you calling a coward?

1754
01:38:15,625 --> 01:38:16,833
You are a coward.

1755
01:38:17,541 --> 01:38:19,458
I come from the land of Bhagat Singh.

1756
01:38:20,208 --> 01:38:22,208
I… I dare you to touch him.

1757
01:38:22,750 --> 01:38:24,041
You bloody terrorist!

1758
01:38:24,333 --> 01:38:26,208
I'll have you on your knees in no time.

1759
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,166
You guys are such emotional fools.

1760
01:38:32,541 --> 01:38:34,583
He came back to save you,

1761
01:38:34,875 --> 01:38:36,458
and you came out to save him.

1762
01:38:39,250 --> 01:38:42,166
If you love each other so much,
then, why do you keep fighting?

1763
01:38:50,958 --> 01:38:52,083
Good job, India.

1764
01:38:52,166 --> 01:38:54,500
Keep the gun pointed at him.
I'll call the cops.

1765
01:38:58,250 --> 01:38:59,875
You nitwit, that was
my iPhone you just broke!

1766
01:38:59,958 --> 01:39:01,375
Do you know how expensive it is?

1767
01:39:01,875 --> 01:39:03,208
I'll shoot you!

1768
01:39:03,416 --> 01:39:04,375
Do it.

1769
01:39:04,625 --> 01:39:05,666
How will that help?

1770
01:39:05,750 --> 01:39:07,416
You will get a bravery award at the most.

1771
01:39:07,833 --> 01:39:10,333
And you'll be on the news for some time.

1772
01:39:10,833 --> 01:39:12,000
Tell me something.

1773
01:39:12,458 --> 01:39:15,541
Which family would let
their son marry a murderer?

1774
01:39:16,500 --> 01:39:19,625
Your country worships
the wolves in sheep's clothing.

1775
01:39:20,958 --> 01:39:22,250
I'll give you a better option.

1776
01:39:22,333 --> 01:39:23,500
Shoot this Pakistani

1777
01:39:24,750 --> 01:39:27,583
and I guarantee that I'll save you.

1778
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,458
Pakistanis are anyway
a burden on this earth.

1779
01:39:30,708 --> 01:39:32,916
India, he wants us to fight.
Don't listen to him.

1780
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:34,125
I'll do something about this.

1781
01:39:34,208 --> 01:39:35,041
Oh, really?

1782
01:39:35,125 --> 01:39:36,000
Will you do something?

1783
01:39:36,083 --> 01:39:39,875
Why did you come back when
you got to know who he was?

1784
01:39:39,958 --> 01:39:41,708
How could I leave you alone with him?

1785
01:39:41,958 --> 01:39:44,500
You should have come back
with some back up at least, you idiot!

1786
01:39:44,916 --> 01:39:46,041
You should have informed the police.

1787
01:39:46,125 --> 01:39:48,958
There's also a prayer meet going on.
You could have asked for help over there.

1788
01:39:49,041 --> 01:39:51,666
You are a Pakistani, not Salman Khan.

1789
01:39:51,875 --> 01:39:54,125
I had gone
to the prayer meet to seek help.

1790
01:39:54,208 --> 01:39:57,041
I swear, your country
is filled with idiots.

1791
01:39:57,708 --> 01:40:00,500
And my phone is dead.
I can't make a call.

1792
01:40:01,250 --> 01:40:04,458
And the police of your
country is simply useless.

1793
01:40:04,708 --> 01:40:08,791
You act stupid and then you
blame the police of my country!

1794
01:40:09,083 --> 01:40:12,333
He is right. I should shoot you instead.

1795
01:40:16,333 --> 01:40:17,375
India?

1796
01:40:18,583 --> 01:40:21,291
This gun is the root
cause of all the problems.

1797
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:26,750
This strange man with no proper
identity is making two countries fight.

1798
01:40:27,500 --> 01:40:29,958
We fight because of such
people and such things.

1799
01:40:30,041 --> 01:40:32,291
And the irony is that we
are indeed fighting like fools.

1800
01:40:33,208 --> 01:40:37,333
Just imagine, how would people fight
or kill if there were no guns at all?

1801
01:40:38,291 --> 01:40:40,916
India, this gun
is the real problem here.

1802
01:40:47,333 --> 01:40:52,500
<i>Glory be to the Goddess!</i>

1803
01:41:01,458 --> 01:41:05,125
-<i>Praise the Goddess who is truthful</i>
-<i>Glory be to the Goddess!</i>

1804
01:41:17,833 --> 01:41:19,250
Be careful, Samar!

1805
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:34,000
<i>Oh, Goddess!</i>
<i>Our hearts are calling out to You</i>

1806
01:41:34,208 --> 01:41:37,916
<i>Oh, Goddess!</i>
<i>Our hearts are calling out to You</i>

1807
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:42,166
<i>Our hearts are calling out to You</i>
<i>You are our support</i>

1808
01:41:42,416 --> 01:41:46,125
<i>Oh, Goddess!</i>
<i>Our hearts are calling out to You</i>

1809
01:41:46,291 --> 01:41:50,458
<i>Oh, Goddess!</i>
<i>Our hearts are calling out to You</i>

1810
01:41:55,125 --> 01:41:58,250
-You scoundrel!
-Hey!

1811
01:42:02,583 --> 01:42:06,708
<i>You are merciful!</i>

1812
01:42:06,916 --> 01:42:10,916
<i>Oh, Goddess!</i>
<i>You are mighty and merciful</i>

1813
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:15,000
<i>Oh, Goddess!</i>
<i>You are mighty and merciful</i>

1814
01:42:15,083 --> 01:42:19,083
<i>Oh, Goddess!</i>
<i>Our hearts are calling out to You</i>

1815
01:42:19,166 --> 01:42:23,041
<i>Oh, Goddess!</i>
<i>Our hearts are calling out to You</i>

1816
01:42:23,125 --> 01:42:27,333
<i>Oh, Goddess!</i>
<i>Our hearts are calling out to You</i>

1817
01:42:35,375 --> 01:42:39,375
<i>I have always prayed to You</i>
<i>With utmost devotion</i>

1818
01:42:39,750 --> 01:42:43,708
<i>Bless me with Your presence</i>
<i>Let me be a fortunate one</i>

1819
01:42:43,791 --> 01:42:47,416
<i>Bless me with Your presence</i>
<i>Let me be a fortunate one</i>

1820
01:42:52,041 --> 01:42:56,041
<i>Please hear my prayers</i>

1821
01:42:56,125 --> 01:43:00,041
<i>Please hear my prayers</i>

1822
01:43:00,166 --> 01:43:04,166
<i>Oh, Goddess!</i>
<i>Our hearts are calling out to You</i>

1823
01:43:04,250 --> 01:43:08,500
<i>Oh, Goddess!</i>
<i>Our hearts are calling out to You</i>

1824
01:43:12,041 --> 01:43:15,750
<i>Glory be to the Goddess!</i>

1825
01:43:15,833 --> 01:43:16,708
<i>Who gets rid of all our problems?</i>

1826
01:43:16,791 --> 01:43:17,625
<i>The Goddess who rides on a lion</i>

1827
01:43:17,708 --> 01:43:18,666
<i>Who get us through all difficulties?</i>

1828
01:43:18,750 --> 01:43:19,583
<i>The Goddess who rides on a lion</i>

1829
01:43:19,666 --> 01:43:20,541
<i>Who takes away all our sorrows?</i>

1830
01:43:20,625 --> 01:43:21,458
<i>The Goddess who rides on a lion</i>

1831
01:43:21,541 --> 01:43:22,375
<i>Who turns all wrongs into right?</i>

1832
01:43:22,458 --> 01:43:23,291
<i>The Goddess who rides on a lion</i>

1833
01:43:23,375 --> 01:43:25,208
-Say it with love
<i>-Praise to thee, Goddess</i>

1834
01:43:25,333 --> 01:43:26,833
-Everyone together
<i>-Praise to thee, Goddess!</i>

1835
01:43:26,916 --> 01:43:28,875
-On top of your voices!
<i>-Praise to thee, Goddess!</i>

1836
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:30,708
-Louder!
<i>-Praise to thee, Goddess!</i>

1837
01:43:30,791 --> 01:43:34,458
<i>Glory be to the Goddess!</i>

1838
01:43:34,541 --> 01:43:40,791
<i>-She mounts a lion</i>
<i>-Glory be to the Goddess!</i>

1839
01:43:40,875 --> 01:43:44,166
<i>-Oh, merciful one</i>
<i>-Praise to thee, Goddess!</i>

1840
01:43:44,250 --> 01:43:46,208
-<i>Oh, mountain dweller</i>
-<i>Praise to thee, Goddess!</i>

1841
01:43:46,375 --> 01:43:48,416
Closer!

1842
01:43:49,291 --> 01:43:51,916
You two have made my life miserable.

1843
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:53,291
Both of you need to die right now.

1844
01:43:53,666 --> 01:43:56,375
<i>Glory be to the Goddess!</i>

1845
01:43:56,458 --> 01:43:57,625
<i>Glory be to the Goddess!</i>

1846
01:43:57,708 --> 01:44:01,750
-<i>Glory be to the merciful Goddess!</i>
-<i>Goddess!</i>

1847
01:44:14,250 --> 01:44:15,375
Chautala, take him away.

1848
01:44:16,208 --> 01:44:17,958
Hey! Get up.

1849
01:44:18,666 --> 01:44:19,791
Arrest him.

1850
01:44:19,916 --> 01:44:20,916
Let's go.

1851
01:44:24,708 --> 01:44:25,708
Make him sit.

1852
01:44:26,750 --> 01:44:27,708
Cuff him up.

1853
01:44:27,833 --> 01:44:28,916
Are you both alright?

1854
01:44:29,541 --> 01:44:30,958
Yes, sir. I'm fine.

1855
01:44:31,708 --> 01:44:33,333
He's one of the most wanted terrorists.

1856
01:44:33,958 --> 01:44:36,208
Anyway, did anyone
else in house get hurt?

1857
01:44:36,833 --> 01:44:40,250
Sir, there was no one else at home.

1858
01:44:41,250 --> 01:44:43,166
-Is this your house?
-Yes, sir.

1859
01:44:44,333 --> 01:44:45,208
Who are you?

1860
01:44:45,958 --> 01:44:47,916
Sir, this is Samar.

1861
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:49,708
He's from Pakistan.

1862
01:44:50,583 --> 01:44:52,458
We met on…

1863
01:44:54,500 --> 01:44:56,208
we met online, sir.

1864
01:44:57,125 --> 01:44:59,333
I invited him over.

1865
01:45:00,166 --> 01:45:03,458
I am safe because he was here.

1866
01:45:11,583 --> 01:45:14,708
Well, whenever an Indian
and a Pakistani try to come closer,

1867
01:45:14,916 --> 01:45:17,083
some idiot shows up and
starts creating problems.

1868
01:45:17,583 --> 01:45:18,625
I don't know why.

1869
01:45:19,583 --> 01:45:22,500
Anyway, it's good to see
the two countries together.

1870
01:45:25,208 --> 01:45:26,125
Indoo!

1871
01:45:26,458 --> 01:45:27,875
Indoo, what's wrong?

1872
01:45:27,958 --> 01:45:29,166
Indoo!

1873
01:45:29,291 --> 01:45:30,500
Police? What happened?

1874
01:45:30,583 --> 01:45:31,583
-What happened?
-What's wrong?

1875
01:45:31,666 --> 01:45:33,250
-Police is here.
-Indoo!

1876
01:45:33,333 --> 01:45:36,125
What… what happened, Indoo?

1877
01:45:36,208 --> 01:45:37,333
Are you alright, dear?

1878
01:45:37,416 --> 01:45:38,250
Are you okay?

1879
01:45:38,333 --> 01:45:39,375
-What happened?
-Let me talk to her.

1880
01:45:39,458 --> 01:45:40,750
No, let me talk to her first.

1881
01:45:40,875 --> 01:45:42,000
Hang on a minute!

1882
01:45:43,291 --> 01:45:44,166
Who are you guys?

1883
01:45:44,250 --> 01:45:45,250
Her neighbors.

1884
01:45:45,333 --> 01:45:46,333
What happened?

1885
01:45:46,916 --> 01:45:48,166
I heard a gunshot.

1886
01:45:48,291 --> 01:45:50,708
Everyone heard it.
That's why we are here.

1887
01:45:50,791 --> 01:45:51,708
You aren't the only one.

1888
01:45:51,791 --> 01:45:54,958
The police and the adults are here.
So, you need not be here.

1889
01:45:55,041 --> 01:45:56,916
-You should go home.
-Yes, son. Go home.

1890
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:58,083
He's here as well.

1891
01:45:58,166 --> 01:45:59,000
Who?

1892
01:45:59,083 --> 01:46:00,083
He's of my age.

1893
01:46:00,166 --> 01:46:02,916
-How does that matter?
-What do you mean?

1894
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:04,291
-Scold him.
-Hang on!

1895
01:46:04,375 --> 01:46:06,625
Introduce yourself, gentleman.

1896
01:46:08,250 --> 01:46:09,375
I mean, who are you?

1897
01:46:09,458 --> 01:46:11,333
Don't worry about him.
I'll handle this.

1898
01:46:11,416 --> 01:46:13,166
-But--
-He's technically her neighbor.

1899
01:46:13,250 --> 01:46:15,791
Both the neighbors will help
each other out. You may leave.

1900
01:46:15,875 --> 01:46:17,083
-But we are here for her.
-We will protect--

1901
01:46:17,166 --> 01:46:18,333
-Please leave!
-We--

1902
01:46:18,416 --> 01:46:19,250
Get them out of here, Chautala.

1903
01:46:19,333 --> 01:46:20,791
-But we are here for her.
-Chautala!

1904
01:46:20,875 --> 01:46:23,291
Go home and give rest to your old bones.

1905
01:46:23,708 --> 01:46:26,125
-Your mom must be waiting.
-Okay.

1906
01:46:26,208 --> 01:46:27,666
-What is it?
-It's nothing.

1907
01:46:27,875 --> 01:46:29,541
-Ranjeet?
-Yes?

1908
01:46:29,875 --> 01:46:32,916
We've never seen this boy
in the neighborhood, right?

1909
01:46:33,916 --> 01:46:37,291
He looks like he's from Noida.

1910
01:46:38,166 --> 01:46:39,375
Go home, guys.

1911
01:46:39,458 --> 01:46:40,666
We're going.

1912
01:46:42,416 --> 01:46:44,291
Do you need an invitation?
Come on.

1913
01:46:44,375 --> 01:46:45,291
Yes.

1914
01:46:48,291 --> 01:46:50,416
I'll come back
if I need more information, okay?

1915
01:46:50,500 --> 01:46:51,333
I'll get going now.

1916
01:46:51,416 --> 01:46:52,833
-Thank you, sir.
-Thank you, sir.

1917
01:47:11,916 --> 01:47:14,083
Are… are you alright?

1918
01:47:14,208 --> 01:47:15,291
I'm so sorry.

1919
01:47:15,375 --> 01:47:17,333
Please have a seat.
I'll go and get first aid.

1920
01:47:22,583 --> 01:47:24,041
Just a little more.

1921
01:47:26,958 --> 01:47:28,875
Almost done.
This is the last wound.

1922
01:47:31,583 --> 01:47:32,583
Thanks.

1923
01:47:34,875 --> 01:47:36,583
I'm the one who should be thanking you.

1924
01:47:37,791 --> 01:47:39,125
You came back for me.

1925
01:47:39,750 --> 01:47:41,541
You even got thrashed for me.

1926
01:47:42,958 --> 01:47:43,958
What?

1927
01:47:45,708 --> 01:47:47,791
I managed to hit him a couple of times.

1928
01:47:47,875 --> 01:47:50,166
No, I didn't mean that.

1929
01:47:51,583 --> 01:47:53,125
You gave him a tough fight.

1930
01:47:57,125 --> 01:47:58,500
Tell me something.

1931
01:47:59,375 --> 01:48:01,000
Did you know that something
would go wrong

1932
01:48:01,083 --> 01:48:04,291
or do you generally keep
knives and red chili powder handy?

1933
01:48:06,833 --> 01:48:10,416
Well, I had hidden those for you.

1934
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:11,833
For me?

1935
01:48:11,916 --> 01:48:14,375
I mean, I had invited a stranger home.

1936
01:48:14,541 --> 01:48:16,000
What if he turned out to be a bad guy?

1937
01:48:20,666 --> 01:48:21,541
So…

1938
01:48:23,458 --> 01:48:25,875
he turned out to a nice guy, right?

1939
01:48:27,916 --> 01:48:28,875
Yes.

1940
01:48:30,750 --> 01:48:32,000
He turned out to be a nice guy.

1941
01:48:33,375 --> 01:48:35,875
And I also learned a lesson
on what's right and what's wrong.

1942
01:48:37,333 --> 01:48:38,958
Sorry for judging you.

1943
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:44,750
Today, I realized that no country
is good or bad.

1944
01:48:46,583 --> 01:48:48,208
It's the people
who are good or bad.

1945
01:48:52,500 --> 01:48:55,125
It is wrong to judge
a book by its cover,

1946
01:48:55,791 --> 01:48:59,500
no matter how fancy it is.

1947
01:49:01,791 --> 01:49:05,166
It is wrong to hate someone
without knowing them.

1948
01:49:07,125 --> 01:49:12,000
Only those who believe
in peace and not war, are right.

1949
01:49:13,833 --> 01:49:15,750
Also, the ones who believe
in love and not hate.

1950
01:49:21,291 --> 01:49:22,166
And…

1951
01:49:22,958 --> 01:49:24,833
do you believe in a kiss?

1952
01:49:27,583 --> 01:49:28,625
Yes.

1953
01:49:31,625 --> 01:49:32,541
But…

1954
01:49:35,166 --> 01:49:37,416
your first kiss has
to be very special.

1955
01:49:38,833 --> 01:49:40,166
And you will always remember it.

1956
01:49:41,333 --> 01:49:42,291
-And it--
-I know!

1957
01:49:43,166 --> 01:49:46,416
And it should happen
with someone special.

1958
01:50:00,125 --> 01:50:01,125
Oh shit!

1959
01:50:01,500 --> 01:50:02,583
Are my parents back?

1960
01:50:02,875 --> 01:50:05,500
I'm sure those wretched men
must have given them a call!

1961
01:50:05,875 --> 01:50:08,041
That stupid terrorist
broke my phone as well.

1962
01:50:08,416 --> 01:50:10,375
Why did I call you here today?

1963
01:50:10,541 --> 01:50:13,291
I've been facing a lot of trouble
from the time you've come here.

1964
01:50:13,833 --> 01:50:15,958
Why are you staring at me?
Get out!

1965
01:50:27,583 --> 01:50:30,375
<i>This is how my first</i>
<i>one-night stand story ends.</i>

1966
01:50:30,750 --> 01:50:32,958
<i>But I have a lot to tell you.</i>

1967
01:50:33,750 --> 01:50:36,041
<i>So, please fasten your seat belt.</i>

1968
01:50:36,291 --> 01:50:39,833
<i>Indoo's next story is ready to take off.</i>

1969
01:50:40,791 --> 01:50:42,208
<i>Let's go!</i>
