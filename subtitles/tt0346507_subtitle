1
00:00:00,042 --> 00:00:03,540
23.976

2
00:01:58,965 --> 00:02:02,126
"Hey Kajal, look,"
your new neighbours have arrived.

3
00:02:02,128 --> 00:02:05,998
"Kiran, come in."

4
00:02:05,998 --> 00:02:09,163
"Raj, your new house."
- Get the luggage.

5
00:02:28,974 --> 00:02:31,430
"You're hopeless, Kajal. I've been"
shouting at you to save the goal!

6
00:02:31,431 --> 00:02:34,012
"The moment she sights a plane,"
she forgets everything else.

7
00:02:34,013 --> 00:02:36,675
That goal was entirely your fault.
- What goal? I won't accept it.

8
00:02:36,675 --> 00:02:39,587
Didn't I ask for time out?
- I didn't hear that.

9
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:42,794
Is it my fault if you were born deaf?
- None of us heard it.

10
00:02:42,794 --> 00:02:44,667
Get your ears cleaned up.
I'm not playing with cheats.

11
00:02:44,668 --> 00:02:46,247
But leave the ball behind.

12
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:50,913
God! Look at this girl! Are hockey
and football games that girls play?

13
00:02:51,367 --> 00:02:54,407
There's no longer any difference
"between a girl and a boy, grandma."

14
00:02:55,032 --> 00:02:58,402
But where are Mummy and Papa?
- Gone to see the neighbours.

15
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:02,355
A professor has moved in. They've
taken some tea and snacks for him.

16
00:03:02,358 --> 00:03:07,608
Give us the ball.
- Shut up!

17
00:03:13,223 --> 00:03:16,051
You have only one son?
"- No, he's my brother-in-law."

18
00:03:16,054 --> 00:03:18,092
What subjects do you
teach in college?

19
00:03:18,092 --> 00:03:22,212
"I'm no professor, Rohit sahab."
The only connection...

20
00:03:22,712 --> 00:03:26,043
I have with the college is that
I run the cafeteria inside the campus

21
00:03:26,044 --> 00:03:29,538
"It's like this, the students come to"
you for classes and to me for snacks.

22
00:03:30,122 --> 00:03:33,245
"In other words, we teachers"
make the students tense...

23
00:03:33,703 --> 00:03:37,740
while you help them relax.
Correct?

24
00:03:37,741 --> 00:03:40,152
"This is my daughter, Kajal."
- Hello dear.

25
00:03:40,155 --> 00:03:42,235
"Say hello to aunt, my child."

26
00:03:42,235 --> 00:03:45,980
Hello dear. Come to me.
So cute.

27
00:03:45,983 --> 00:03:51,312
Which class are you studying in?
- Class sixth.

28
00:03:57,054 --> 00:04:00,591
Do you have a name by any chance?
- Raj.

29
00:04:00,592 --> 00:04:02,840
Well...

30
00:04:02,841 --> 00:04:07,085
"Okay, nice name."

31
00:04:07,086 --> 00:04:09,330
"Will you be my friend, Raj?"

32
00:04:09,331 --> 00:04:13,121
What does that mean?
- My friendships don't last.

33
00:04:13,122 --> 00:04:15,991
My friends usually desert me
in a matter of days.

34
00:04:15,992 --> 00:04:19,362
Why is that?
- I'm not like other boys.

35
00:04:19,365 --> 00:04:25,112
"I can't play,"
I can't run.

36
00:04:31,269 --> 00:04:37,725
"Well, I'm not like others, either."
I'm your friend for keeps.

37
00:04:40,427 --> 00:04:43,632
Let me teach you to fly this plane.
- I wish I could get into this plane.

38
00:04:43,632 --> 00:04:47,127
"It's kind of small, isn't it?"
- You don't know how to fly a plane?

39
00:04:47,129 --> 00:04:49,875
"I'm small now. Wait till I grow up,"
I will fly a big airplane some day.

40
00:04:49,877 --> 00:04:54,704
Will you let me sit in your plane then?
- Of course.

41
00:04:54,704 --> 00:04:58,242
I've cooked the food.
Eat it up and enjoy.

42
00:04:58,826 --> 00:05:01,906
It must have taken you ages
to prepare so much food.

43
00:05:02,362 --> 00:05:06,776
Big deal! Preparing food for
one's dear ones is no trouble.

44
00:05:07,233 --> 00:05:11,480
"Don't I cook for my wife, too?"
- You cook for your wife?

45
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:15,309
"If not me, will you cook for her?"
- No. What I meant was...

46
00:05:16,266 --> 00:05:18,846
doesn't she cook at all?
- She doesn't.

47
00:05:18,848 --> 00:05:22,300
She'd much rather watch films.
She goes to the movies every Sunday.

48
00:05:22,302 --> 00:05:25,757
Don't you go with her?
- I don't.

49
00:05:25,757 --> 00:05:29,086
She prefers my neighbour Ramdas
for company.

50
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:33,374
You must be kidding.
"- Believe me, I'm not. Yesterday..."

51
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,704
"I saw it with my own eyes,"
Ramdas was waiting around the corner.

52
00:05:36,704 --> 00:05:40,199
What did you do then?
- Why me? They had to do the things.

53
00:05:40,201 --> 00:05:44,653
They looked at each other
and smiled fondly.

54
00:05:44,653 --> 00:05:47,567
Then?
- I followed them at a distance.

55
00:05:47,569 --> 00:05:52,105
Then?
- They went straight to Moti theatre.

56
00:05:52,605 --> 00:05:55,266
Bought tickets in black
and went right in.

57
00:05:55,269 --> 00:05:57,557
Then?
- Why would I leave them?

58
00:05:57,559 --> 00:06:01,721
"I bought a ticket in black, too,"
and went and sat behind them.

59
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:05,632
Then what happened?
- Then what?

60
00:06:05,634 --> 00:06:09,129
I was so upset. My mood was ruined.
- Why?

61
00:06:10,211 --> 00:06:14,206
It was the movie I'd seen on Friday.

62
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:18,870
Boring movie. But I didn't warn them.
I thought they deserved to watch it.

63
00:06:19,786 --> 00:06:22,365
"Dear GI Joe, you're amazing."
- What's so amazing?

64
00:06:22,367 --> 00:06:26,237
"It was a matter of three hours,"
and life is short.

65
00:06:26,237 --> 00:06:31,149
What a wife God has given me.

66
00:06:31,899 --> 00:06:37,144
Ramdas-ji gets to go to
the movies with her...

67
00:06:37,644 --> 00:06:43,220
"while I'm left at home,"
to cook food.

68
00:06:43,221 --> 00:06:45,009
Strange man.

69
00:06:45,011 --> 00:06:48,338
What happened to Raj's legs?
"- Nothing serious, really."

70
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:51,752
He met with an accident once
and hurt his knee.

71
00:06:51,754 --> 00:06:54,584
"We gave him the best treatment,"
but he's psyched now.

72
00:06:54,584 --> 00:06:58,372
He thinks he might fall
if he tried to walk.

73
00:06:58,372 --> 00:07:02,867
That is why he doesn't move
without the braces.

74
00:07:02,867 --> 00:07:06,197
Doctors say he has
only lost his confidence.

75
00:07:07,447 --> 00:07:10,317
The day he gets back
his confidence...

76
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:15,271
he will be able to run and play
like other children.

77
00:07:15,271 --> 00:07:18,603
"We still hope, although it's now"
two years since the accident.

78
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:25,927
"Don't worry, everything will be"
all right by God's grace.

79
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:43,747
It was nice meeting you.
"Now, please release your hands."

80
00:07:45,617 --> 00:07:51,740
"Switch off the signal,"
the train has already left. Come on.

81
00:07:53,608 --> 00:07:57,230
"Where are you going, my express train?"
- I'm going to teach Raj skating.

82
00:07:58,396 --> 00:08:02,641
How can he go skating with you?
- Why can't he?

83
00:08:02,641 --> 00:08:04,555
Can a blind man watch a movie?
- No.

84
00:08:04,555 --> 00:08:05,887
Can the dumb sing?
- No.

85
00:08:05,889 --> 00:08:07,261
Can the deaf hear?
- No.

86
00:08:07,262 --> 00:08:10,673
Can I roam around
in a car like a hero?

87
00:08:10,675 --> 00:08:12,754
No.
- Then how can Raj skate?

88
00:08:12,757 --> 00:08:17,209
Raj can skate. Understood?

89
00:08:17,211 --> 00:08:22,209
Hey Ramdas!

90
00:08:22,413 --> 00:08:24,326
"Uncle, has Raj woken up?"
"- Yes, why?"

91
00:08:24,329 --> 00:08:28,199
I want to teach the stupid skates.
"- My child, you know he can't skate."

92
00:08:28,656 --> 00:08:31,362
Why can't he? I've just been
telling GI Joe that.

93
00:08:31,362 --> 00:08:35,067
Must I argue with you too? Give me
one good reason why he can't skate?

94
00:08:39,605 --> 00:08:42,683
"I can't do it, no. Look Kajal,"
I don't know how to skate.

95
00:08:43,393 --> 00:08:46,553
"I'm going to teach you, am I not?"
- But I will fall.

96
00:08:46,556 --> 00:08:49,177
Will you stop walking
for fear of falling?

97
00:08:49,177 --> 00:08:54,591
"Come on, hold my hand"

98
00:08:55,379 --> 00:08:59,043
"Kajal, lame horses do not win races."

99
00:08:59,543 --> 00:09:02,248
"He already has a broken leg, now"
the poor guy will break an arm too.

100
00:09:02,249 --> 00:09:07,283
"Why, he may even break his head."

101
00:09:07,284 --> 00:09:10,657
Unless Raj beats all of you
"at skating, I'm no Kajal."

102
00:09:26,182 --> 00:09:31,721
"For the sake of our friendship,"
"come on Raj, get up!"

103
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:26,870
It's the inter-collegiate football
final and the scores are equal.

104
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,451
They are on extra time.

105
00:10:28,452 --> 00:10:33,701
St John's players are attacking hard.

106
00:11:16,697 --> 00:11:22,945
Won't you say something
to your friends?

107
00:11:29,975 --> 00:11:34,427
I'm not going.

108
00:11:34,428 --> 00:11:38,466
"Friends, I'm able to stand"
before you today...

109
00:11:39,633 --> 00:11:42,546
only because of this friend of mine.

110
00:11:42,547 --> 00:11:45,835
"Else, I would still be struggling"
"to walk, leave alone run."

111
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:51,952
She had faith in me and I in her.

112
00:11:53,619 --> 00:11:59,739
Even today I remember the day
when she coaxed me into running.

113
00:12:00,985 --> 00:12:04,649
"And from that day,"
she's been making me run...

114
00:12:06,273 --> 00:12:08,562
whether it is with her love
or with scolding.

115
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:10,892
"Keep quiet, stupid."

116
00:12:10,893 --> 00:12:16,971
So Kajal has more right to
the trophy than I have.

117
00:12:23,254 --> 00:12:26,000
This Raj is such a duffer.

118
00:12:26,003 --> 00:12:29,166
Know why? People generally
snatch away the rights of others...

119
00:12:29,581 --> 00:12:32,745
and here's this stupid guy
who hands over his rights to others.

120
00:12:32,745 --> 00:12:37,533
Today's victory entirely belongs to
"him, yet he wants to share it with me."

121
00:12:45,484 --> 00:12:51,812
May God give everyone such a friend.
I'm so proud of him.

122
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:21,278
I dream of him
over and over again

123
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,570
And I know for sure...

124
00:13:25,067 --> 00:13:28,649
I dream of him
over and over again

125
00:13:28,649 --> 00:13:32,100
And I know for sure...

126
00:13:32,101 --> 00:13:35,557
my beloved shall come to me someday

127
00:13:39,802 --> 00:13:43,091
And I shall belong to him...

128
00:13:43,091 --> 00:13:46,254
Lost completely in his love

129
00:14:01,365 --> 00:14:04,817
I dream of her
over and over again

130
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:07,942
And I know for sure...

131
00:14:08,734 --> 00:14:12,104
I dream of her
over and over again

132
00:14:12,105 --> 00:14:15,436
And I know for sure...

133
00:14:15,975 --> 00:14:19,307
my sweetheart
shall come to me someday

134
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:26,048
And I shall belong to her...

135
00:14:26,548 --> 00:14:29,629
Lost completely in her love

136
00:15:06,758 --> 00:15:10,211
He robs me of my sleep

137
00:15:10,214 --> 00:15:13,832
He makes me sleepless all night

138
00:15:13,835 --> 00:15:17,581
Makes me more and more restless

139
00:15:17,581 --> 00:15:23,827
He torments me no end

140
00:15:24,865 --> 00:15:28,235
She's different

141
00:15:28,238 --> 00:15:31,274
I need to tell her...

142
00:15:31,817 --> 00:15:35,644
that I'm crazy for her

143
00:15:35,644 --> 00:15:39,142
She taught me
what love is all about

144
00:15:39,143 --> 00:15:42,182
"For her, I could die..."

145
00:15:42,806 --> 00:15:45,844
I know for sure

146
00:15:53,793 --> 00:16:00,331
My beloved will come someday

147
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:04,158
And I shall belong to him...

148
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:11,032
Lost completely in his love

149
00:16:44,826 --> 00:16:48,282
The one who I've
set my eyes upon...

150
00:16:48,283 --> 00:16:51,860
she is completely ignorant...

151
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:55,648
though she is so close to me

152
00:16:55,649 --> 00:17:01,690
She is special

153
00:17:03,057 --> 00:17:06,387
He won't find a girl like me

154
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:09,884
For all his indifference...

155
00:17:09,884 --> 00:17:13,712
once he looks me in the eye...

156
00:17:13,713 --> 00:17:17,211
he'll never turn back

157
00:17:17,211 --> 00:17:20,874
He has snatched my peace

158
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:24,661
But I'm sure...

159
00:17:24,662 --> 00:17:31,404
She will come to me someday...
my sweetheart

160
00:17:32,114 --> 00:17:35,317
I'll belong to her...

161
00:17:35,317 --> 00:17:41,731
Lost completely in her love

162
00:18:15,153 --> 00:18:17,942
"Not 11,000 you have to pay only 6,000."
- But please listen to me...

163
00:18:17,942 --> 00:18:21,644
Just listen to me. Go home and
check the accounts. Please go.

164
00:18:21,645 --> 00:18:25,018
Did you see Kajal?
- No. I've been wrapped up...

165
00:18:25,019 --> 00:18:29,262
with my own problems since morning.
GI Joe must have seen her around.

166
00:18:29,265 --> 00:18:32,550
A cutlet? What about my omelet?
- I will send it.

167
00:18:33,969 --> 00:18:38,377
"I'm in tension, this man ordered an"
"omelet, and I sent him a cutlet..."

168
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:41,541
Have you seen Kajal?
- She left early this morning.

169
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,454
Where did Kajal go?
"- Not Kajal, I'm talking about my wife"

170
00:18:45,873 --> 00:18:48,661
"She went away early this morning,"
and I know where she's gone...

171
00:18:48,662 --> 00:18:52,076
to watch a movie with Ramdas.
- So early in the morning?

172
00:18:52,615 --> 00:18:55,738
For the morning show. My wife
"makes me so tense, and you...?"

173
00:18:56,153 --> 00:18:59,275
Why don't you reason with your wife?
Why does she go to watch movies...

174
00:18:59,276 --> 00:19:01,940
with someone else?
Why doesn't she go with you?

175
00:19:01,941 --> 00:19:05,229
You think I haven't tried?
Do you think women understand?

176
00:19:05,684 --> 00:19:08,892
It's not her fault though.
Films these days...

177
00:19:09,307 --> 00:19:14,009
aren't the sort women would
want to see with their husbands.

178
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:16,883
He is laughing
when I'm seriously stressed out.

179
00:19:16,884 --> 00:19:19,671
What do you want from me?
- I'm only asking you...

180
00:19:19,672 --> 00:19:23,291
whether you've seen Kajal around.
"If not, quit chewing my brains."

181
00:19:23,294 --> 00:19:26,914
"Yes, I did see her in the campus."
She seemed to be quite tensed.

182
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:30,660
Which college is open on Sundays?
- For those who're tensed...

183
00:19:30,661 --> 00:19:32,825
what's a Sunday or Monday?
If the college is closed...

184
00:19:32,826 --> 00:19:35,073
she may be in the library. One can
sit and read a book when he's worried

185
00:19:35,074 --> 00:19:37,903
Strange. Look he's tensed now.
"So, you know what tension is?"

186
00:19:37,903 --> 00:19:40,732
A tensed man can murder someone
or commit suicide.

187
00:19:40,733 --> 00:19:44,021
He can go to jail or hang himself.
You understand what I mean?

188
00:19:44,022 --> 00:19:47,269
Shut up! Get back to work.
- I can do it only after you get out.

189
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:50,390
This is the misfortune of our country
...anybody can take another's place.

190
00:19:50,391 --> 00:19:53,055
Where is my omelet?
- Oh my God!

191
00:19:53,056 --> 00:19:56,424
For an omelet you need to first
bring a hen and a cock together.

192
00:19:56,425 --> 00:19:59,964
"Then you need to break it open, add"
spice to it and pour it over the pan.

193
00:20:00,423 --> 00:20:05,041
Shall I do that to you? Get lost!

194
00:20:05,044 --> 00:20:10,459
Is today a day of tension?
"Oh, this omelet!"

195
00:20:13,451 --> 00:20:17,115
No! Let me go!
- I've been waiting for this day.

196
00:20:18,029 --> 00:20:23,356
You deceived me and called me here.
- Deceived you? Whatever.

197
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:29,480
All's fair in love and war.

198
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:54,457
How dare he touch you?
"- Raj, stop it."

199
00:21:08,189 --> 00:21:12,935
"Stop it, Raj!"

200
00:21:27,461 --> 00:21:33,121
"Stop it, Raj!"
"Are you crazy, Raj?"

201
00:21:33,122 --> 00:21:38,156
Saved!
- How dare he touch you?

202
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:41,113
"Stop it, will you? This isn't right."
- This isn't right?

203
00:21:41,114 --> 00:21:47,528
So what he was doing to you was right?
- But what was he doing?

204
00:21:50,188 --> 00:21:53,518
I won't spare you!
"- Stop it, or he'll die."

205
00:21:53,976 --> 00:21:56,765
How dare he touch you? You're alone...
- I'm not alone. Everyone is here!

206
00:21:56,766 --> 00:22:01,556
Where is everyone?

207
00:22:02,134 --> 00:22:04,381
When did they arrive?

208
00:22:04,382 --> 00:22:06,755
They've been with me since morning.
"When did they arrive, eh?"

209
00:22:06,756 --> 00:22:10,125
Shit! He ruined the rehearsal
of our play.

210
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:16,326
"Hey, who is this?"
Who's been killed?

211
00:22:16,327 --> 00:22:18,990
Kamal...?
- GI Joe!

212
00:22:18,991 --> 00:22:20,740
Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

213
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,489
Are you all right?
- I'm fine!

214
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:24,612
"Fine, really? You aren't even able"
to say you're fine properly.

215
00:22:24,613 --> 00:22:27,482
And you say you're fine?
"You're not fine, neither am I."

216
00:22:27,483 --> 00:22:30,395
Nice makeup!
You act so well.

217
00:22:30,396 --> 00:22:33,769
Killed him!

218
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:35,517
How'd I know it was only a rehearsal?
- Stupid.

219
00:22:35,518 --> 00:22:38,890
Shut up! You should've told me
it was only a rehearsal.

220
00:22:47,337 --> 00:22:52,586
"Listen to me, Kajal."

221
00:22:57,578 --> 00:22:59,285
Is this fair?

222
00:22:59,286 --> 00:23:03,449
What happened? Did you find Kajal?
"- Yes I did, at the rehearsal."

223
00:23:04,364 --> 00:23:06,693
Listen...

224
00:23:06,694 --> 00:23:10,190
Why didn't you tell me
she was rehearsing for a play?

225
00:23:10,191 --> 00:23:13,313
I told you she was under some tension.
- How's tension related to rehearsal?

226
00:23:15,853 --> 00:23:19,221
"The show is just four days away,"
and they're yet to perform well.

227
00:23:19,222 --> 00:23:23,344
"You've beaten the hero black and blue,"
so wouldn't she be under tension?

228
00:23:23,345 --> 00:23:28,337
"Now you're under tension, too."
Would you like to have a cold drink?

229
00:23:28,338 --> 00:23:31,126
I rusticate you!

230
00:23:31,127 --> 00:23:35,500
Let's do something. When she's
"under tension, she feels very hungry."

231
00:23:36,288 --> 00:23:39,868
"Take some samosas to her,"
and some pastries too.

232
00:23:40,576 --> 00:23:44,115
"Let me add some noodles, too."
Don't tell her I sent them.

233
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:49,692
She'll only get angry.
You know her temper.

234
00:23:49,692 --> 00:23:52,230
Now what's happened?
What's the matter now?

235
00:23:52,231 --> 00:23:55,229
Just thinking. You can never
understand women's moods.

236
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:57,683
"Some get tense when they're hungry,"
some get hungry under stress.

237
00:23:57,684 --> 00:24:01,806
Let me tell you about my wife...
- Quiet.

238
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:03,720
Shall I go?
- Serve these.

239
00:24:03,721 --> 00:24:05,969
"Manish, say your lines."

240
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:09,507
Whether you call it hoodwinking
"or cheating, Madhu..."

241
00:24:09,508 --> 00:24:12,336
What's this you're doing? Are you
dancing or speaking your lines?

242
00:24:12,336 --> 00:24:16,458
I'm speaking my lines.
- Get lost.

243
00:24:16,459 --> 00:24:19,413
"Tapan, you try it."
"Give him the cue, Sweety."

244
00:24:19,413 --> 00:24:22,285
You hoodwinked me here.
- Whether you call it hoodwinking...

245
00:24:22,286 --> 00:24:26,405
"or cheating, call it an apple or"
"grapes, call it whatever you wish..."

246
00:24:26,949 --> 00:24:30,153
"Tapan, is this line in the dialogue?"
"- No, this is my own. Original."

247
00:24:34,647 --> 00:24:37,269
Your fury has lost its sting.
"Eat something, you'll be stronger..."

248
00:24:37,269 --> 00:24:40,767
"and your temper will flare up, too."
"- Get lost. Sweety, cue, fast."

249
00:24:40,768 --> 00:24:46,141
You hoodwinked me here.

250
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:51,587
But everything's fair
"in love and war, Madhu."

251
00:24:51,588 --> 00:24:54,295
Acting is not their cup of tea.
Give me a chance.

252
00:24:54,296 --> 00:24:57,625
"I may not look like a hero, but I can"
act so well that I can stun everyone.

253
00:25:08,365 --> 00:25:10,319
You're laughing?
- When was I laughing?

254
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,317
I saw you laughing.
- I didn't.

255
00:25:12,318 --> 00:25:14,317
Are you sure?
- Sure. Did the snacks work?

256
00:25:14,317 --> 00:25:17,688
How'll it work?
See this?

257
00:25:17,689 --> 00:25:20,852
And you're asking me how it was?
Does it work this way?

258
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:22,892
What should I do?
- If you want to save...

259
00:25:22,893 --> 00:25:25,680
"your life, property and honour,"
"get the hell out of here, quick."

260
00:25:25,681 --> 00:25:29,218
I was thinking just that.
"- Don't think, run for your life."

261
00:25:29,219 --> 00:25:32,631
Get out of here before Kajal comes.

262
00:25:32,632 --> 00:25:35,127
I didn't get the omelet. Do you
have anything else on your menu?

263
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:40,207
Menu? Can't you see?

264
00:25:40,208 --> 00:25:43,663
Salt and chilies...
now lick me.

265
00:25:44,412 --> 00:25:47,909
"Lick me up, come on."
- Hey what do you think you're doing?

266
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:52,237
Does he think he can escape
hiding at home? I will not spare him.

267
00:25:52,238 --> 00:25:54,358
"Bhabhi, where's Raj?"
(Bhabhi - Sister-in-law)

268
00:25:54,361 --> 00:25:58,814
He...? He's fast asleep.
"- Asleep, eh? Let me go and see."

269
00:25:58,815 --> 00:26:02,644
How dare you sleep now?
Get up!

270
00:26:03,352 --> 00:26:05,596
Why are you hitting me?
Have you gone mad?

271
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:08,636
"Sleeping blissfully, eh? You ruined"
"my sleep! You hit my hero, remember?"

272
00:26:09,179 --> 00:26:11,218
It was a mistake.
- Just wait.

273
00:26:11,219 --> 00:26:13,673
I'll make a zero out of you.
- A bat...? Itll hurt me.

274
00:26:13,673 --> 00:26:16,421
"You like to hit people, don't you?"
Now you will do the acting.

275
00:26:16,422 --> 00:26:19,375
But none of my ancestors ever acted.
"- Raj, I'm very angry."

276
00:26:19,375 --> 00:26:25,539
I've not worn any clothes underneath.
- Shame on you! I'll put them on you!

277
00:26:27,411 --> 00:26:29,449
What are you guys doing?
- Bhabhi...

278
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:33,819
"Bhabhi, this girl is crazy."
- You stupid.

279
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:37,317
Everything's fair
"in love and war, Madhu."

280
00:26:38,067 --> 00:26:40,064
"By the way, tell me,"
just who is this Rajiv?

281
00:26:40,065 --> 00:26:42,104
"Raj, now don't act"
as if you don't know.

282
00:26:42,105 --> 00:26:46,472
"Sometimes you ask me to act, sometimes"
you ask me not to. What am I to do?

283
00:26:46,473 --> 00:26:49,762
"What I mean is, act in a way"
that looks natural.

284
00:26:50,554 --> 00:26:53,884
Wasn't that natural?
"- Sweety, what are his last lines?"

285
00:26:54,467 --> 00:26:57,461
"Here, read this."
- And read it aloud!

286
00:26:57,462 --> 00:27:00,500
This is all because of you

287
00:27:00,501 --> 00:27:04,998
"You were mine, you are mine,"
and you will always be mine.

288
00:27:05,454 --> 00:27:07,787
Don't scream!

289
00:27:07,788 --> 00:27:12,156
"I mean, don't be so loud."
"Speak from within, please."

290
00:27:12,824 --> 00:27:16,442
"You wanted me to speak aloud, and now"
you're telling me to speak from within

291
00:27:16,443 --> 00:27:20,356
"You were mine, you are mine,"
and you will always be mine.

292
00:27:22,939 --> 00:27:28,853
Now what?
- Come out! Out!

293
00:27:30,431 --> 00:27:33,925
"When I said speak from within,"
I meant let it come from your heart.

294
00:27:33,928 --> 00:27:36,882
"Sweety, give him a cue please."
- Take it!

295
00:27:36,883 --> 00:27:41,461
"Promise me,"
you'll never break my heart.

296
00:27:41,461 --> 00:27:45,414
"Why just my promise,"
"you can keep my heart, too."

297
00:27:48,747 --> 00:27:52,659
"Now, why are you lying there?"
"Get up, will you?"

298
00:27:53,156 --> 00:27:55,528
I don't want to act.

299
00:27:55,529 --> 00:27:58,778
And this is one bad interior!
"- Raj, I said, come here."

300
00:27:59,692 --> 00:28:05,897
Tell me.
- Hold my hand.

301
00:28:09,848 --> 00:28:13,635
Look deep into my eyes.

302
00:28:13,636 --> 00:28:18,673
I'm the one who is dearer to you
than life

303
00:28:21,547 --> 00:28:26,874
"And for me, you'll gladly"
accept death.

304
00:28:26,875 --> 00:28:29,578
I'm the one.

305
00:28:29,579 --> 00:28:34,662
Feel it.

306
00:28:36,655 --> 00:28:41,526
And say those lines now.

307
00:28:41,527 --> 00:28:45,520
You were mine...

308
00:28:45,521 --> 00:28:48,183
you are mine...

309
00:28:48,184 --> 00:28:50,807
and you'll always be mine.

310
00:28:50,807 --> 00:28:55,471
"O Angel of Love, how can"
I forget such a noble sacrifice?

311
00:28:56,510 --> 00:29:00,798
Sacrifice? I don't know.
It's a huge honour...

312
00:29:01,588 --> 00:29:06,711
to be kissed by lips as silken
as these before one dies.

313
00:29:08,625 --> 00:29:11,871
Fie on those lips
that kill.

314
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:33,971
I must say it now...

315
00:29:33,972 --> 00:29:40,386
that I've fallen in love with you

316
00:29:42,257 --> 00:29:48,131
I can't bear to stay away
from you anymore

317
00:29:48,625 --> 00:29:55,038
"For, I've fallen in love with you"

318
00:30:14,017 --> 00:30:19,969
"I love you,"
I love that attitude

319
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:27,546
And that's a secret
that I've hidden for years

320
00:30:28,627 --> 00:30:34,952
"I love you,"
I love your attitude

321
00:30:35,622 --> 00:30:41,864
And that's a secret
that I've hidden for years

322
00:30:43,987 --> 00:30:47,107
You are the one I talk about

323
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:50,895
You are the one
who makes me restless

324
00:30:54,683 --> 00:31:00,555
Every moment of mine
is now painted in hues of joy

325
00:31:09,127 --> 00:31:14,998
I can't bear to stay away
from you anymore

326
00:31:15,663 --> 00:31:19,201
"For, I've fallen in love with you"

327
00:31:19,201 --> 00:31:25,449
I'm in love with you

328
00:31:46,173 --> 00:31:49,297
Let's leave the world...

329
00:31:49,961 --> 00:31:53,000
somewhere far behind

330
00:31:53,834 --> 00:31:55,704
Come...

331
00:31:55,707 --> 00:31:59,951
let's cross all limits today

332
00:32:00,826 --> 00:32:03,990
Let's leave the world...

333
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:07,817
somewhere far behind

334
00:32:07,818 --> 00:32:14,105
"Come, let's cross all limits today"

335
00:32:16,603 --> 00:32:19,641
What's this high of love?

336
00:32:20,141 --> 00:32:23,635
I know not where it has brought me

337
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:32,920
Togetherness is incomplete
without you

338
00:32:33,461 --> 00:32:39,959
"For, I've fallen in love with you"

339
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:47,862
I must say it now...

340
00:32:47,863 --> 00:32:51,027
that I've fallen in love with you

341
00:33:18,874 --> 00:33:21,868
"Death is a prize to be coveted, Madhu."

342
00:33:21,871 --> 00:33:24,531
It would have been a punishment
if I'd been condemned...

343
00:33:24,534 --> 00:33:28,323
to stay away
from your sweet lips.

344
00:33:28,324 --> 00:33:33,401
"Now, it's enough my love,"

345
00:33:33,402 --> 00:33:37,021
It's time for me to go.
Don't stop me.

346
00:33:39,603 --> 00:33:42,847
"So long then, my love."
- Don't go...

347
00:33:42,848 --> 00:33:47,307
"Goodbye, my love."
- No.

348
00:33:50,548 --> 00:33:55,007
No!

349
00:33:56,711 --> 00:34:01,828
You can't leave me all alone.

350
00:34:01,829 --> 00:34:06,865
You can't...

351
00:34:06,866 --> 00:34:11,742
my love.

352
00:34:18,521 --> 00:34:21,811
"Raj, when did you get this"
call letter from the air force?

353
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:25,597
Just this morning.
- Strange. When did you decide?

354
00:34:25,597 --> 00:34:28,262
When did you apply?
You didn't even tell us.

355
00:34:28,264 --> 00:34:31,759
And why such a hasty decision?
- It was not sudden.

356
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:36,295
You know very well I've always
been fond of the air force.

357
00:34:36,297 --> 00:34:39,458
"Do you have any objections, brother?"
- Why will I object?

358
00:34:40,168 --> 00:34:44,626
Keep in touch after you get there.

359
00:34:48,909 --> 00:34:51,114
I am going to the college.

360
00:34:51,114 --> 00:34:54,820
Whose dream are you trying to fulfill?
Yours? Or somebody else's?

361
00:34:55,318 --> 00:34:58,565
"Who else's, bhabhi?"
- Kajal's. Who else's?

362
00:35:01,231 --> 00:35:05,143
Have you told her that you love her
and that you wish to marry her?

363
00:35:06,891 --> 00:35:12,675
"Yes bhabhi, I did tell her once."

364
00:35:12,677 --> 00:35:14,965
"Will you marry me, Kajal?"

365
00:35:14,967 --> 00:35:18,335
Why not?
- Look at her. She's so lucky.

366
00:35:18,338 --> 00:35:21,833
Her husband works in the air force.
He can fly her everyday in an airplane

367
00:35:22,666 --> 00:35:24,956
I'll also fly you everyday
when I grow up.

368
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:30,704
So proposition me
"after you grow up, stupid."

369
00:35:30,992 --> 00:35:34,197
What did Kajal reply?
"- About what, bhabhi?"

370
00:35:34,947 --> 00:35:38,235
Gosh! Did you tell Kajal
about your love for her?

371
00:35:38,983 --> 00:35:43,188
There's nothing about me
that she doesn't know.

372
00:35:43,771 --> 00:35:47,309
"She knows what I like, what I don't,"
when I get angry...

373
00:35:47,806 --> 00:35:51,181
"when I am affectionate, when I go"
to sleep... she knows everything.

374
00:35:52,762 --> 00:35:57,882
All I got to do is propose her?
- And when will you do that?

375
00:35:59,047 --> 00:36:03,708
"I will, bhabhi. The very day"
"I become a pilot, I will."

376
00:36:05,373 --> 00:36:09,411
I'll fly her in my plane.
"At 30,000 feet altitude..."

377
00:36:10,744 --> 00:36:17,195
"amongst the clouds, I'll propose her."
"Will you marry me, Kajal?"

378
00:36:17,862 --> 00:36:20,858
"Well, well!"
What are you squealing?

379
00:36:20,858 --> 00:36:23,188
No squealing at all.
- You must've been talking about me.

380
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:26,143
"No, I was only telling her..."
"- Anyway, I don't care."

381
00:36:26,143 --> 00:36:29,681
"Come out fast, I want to talk to you."
- To me?

382
00:36:30,099 --> 00:36:33,344
"Yes, to you. I want to tell you"
"something personal, stupid. Come on."

383
00:36:35,552 --> 00:36:38,922
"Uncle is great. He says something,"
does something else...

384
00:36:39,338 --> 00:36:42,210
but it happens quite the opposite.
- Keep quiet.

385
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:45,001
How dare you join the air force
without asking me?

386
00:36:45,001 --> 00:36:48,996
It was decided when we were kids.
"- Still, you should've asked me."

387
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:52,034
You asked me before joining the play?
- I didn't have to go far away...

388
00:36:52,036 --> 00:36:54,614
to perform the play.
When will you return?

389
00:36:54,614 --> 00:36:56,822
After a year and a half.
- A year and a half?

390
00:36:56,822 --> 00:36:59,027
No way. Come back in three months.
- I can't learn to ride a bicycle...

391
00:36:59,027 --> 00:37:01,025
in 3 months. How will I learn
to fly a plane?

392
00:37:01,027 --> 00:37:04,355
"Okay, four months, not a day more."
"- A year and a half, not a day less."

393
00:37:04,356 --> 00:37:07,643
What will I do here all alone?
- You will miss me...

394
00:37:08,143 --> 00:37:11,224
"write letters, and maybe cry a little."
"- Cry, my foot!"

395
00:37:11,849 --> 00:37:15,344
Will you call me as soon as you've
learnt how to fly a plane? Promise?

396
00:37:16,469 --> 00:37:19,340
Promise.
- Fly the plane over our canteen...

397
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:22,170
so I can see you and wave. Agreed?
"- Kajal, it's a plane I have to fly..."

398
00:37:22,172 --> 00:37:28,170
not a kite that I can fly
over your terrace.

399
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:34,076
"Now let's go, come."

400
00:37:34,077 --> 00:37:39,652
Listen...
- Tell me.

401
00:37:39,655 --> 00:37:44,065
Take care of yourself.

402
00:37:44,067 --> 00:37:50,559
Eat properly and don't work so hard
that you become weak.

403
00:37:54,056 --> 00:37:58,094
And come back soon. Okay?

404
00:37:58,094 --> 00:38:04,134
"I'm not even gone yet,"
and you are crying already?

405
00:39:41,739 --> 00:39:45,110
Here's one more.
A boy asks his teacher...

406
00:39:45,112 --> 00:39:48,693
Will you punish me for what
I have not done?

407
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:51,313
"No dear, says the teacher."
What have you not done?

408
00:39:51,313 --> 00:39:56,646
I haven't done the homework

409
00:39:57,306 --> 00:40:03,264
Look! That must be Raj
who's flying the plane.

410
00:40:05,634 --> 00:40:10,088
But how do you know it's Raj?
- I asked him to fly over the canteen.

411
00:40:12,918 --> 00:40:16,289
Don't wave! Take your hand inside.
Listen to me.

412
00:40:16,871 --> 00:40:21,324
"Take your hand inside, my pilot!"

413
00:40:21,326 --> 00:40:25,155
"But GI Joe, it's been only six months"
since Raj joined the air force.

414
00:40:25,655 --> 00:40:28,818
He can't fly a plane so soon.
- He's been flying since childhood.

415
00:40:29,235 --> 00:40:33,313
"Yes, he doesn't take long"
to learn new things.

416
00:40:33,313 --> 00:40:36,226
"Stick your hand out, Raj."
"Now do a somersault, a back flip."

417
00:40:36,228 --> 00:40:40,722
"Somersaults, eh? He won't be allowed"
to even go near an airplane so early.

418
00:40:41,222 --> 00:40:44,302
What do you mean?
What do you know about Raj?

419
00:40:44,302 --> 00:40:46,592
"Not about Raj, but I know"
the air force too well.

420
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:49,838
My uncle is an air force officer.
- No wonder Raj beat you up.

421
00:40:49,838 --> 00:40:55,005
Take it from me now!

422
00:41:47,739 --> 00:41:50,235
How silly this heart is

423
00:41:50,237 --> 00:41:52,817
It leaves one in a quandary

424
00:41:52,818 --> 00:41:57,313
For no reasons
it lays its trust on someone

425
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:05,389
For lovers...

426
00:42:05,889 --> 00:42:12,344
it makes life miserable

427
00:42:53,507 --> 00:42:55,878
None can reason with it

428
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:58,501
Love is beyond reasoning

429
00:42:58,501 --> 00:43:01,164
What is love all about...

430
00:43:01,166 --> 00:43:07,079
only lovers know

431
00:43:09,242 --> 00:43:11,612
Obsessed lovers
drown themselves...

432
00:43:11,614 --> 00:43:14,318
in the depths of love

433
00:43:14,318 --> 00:43:16,650
They find restlessness...

434
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:20,603
in solitude

435
00:43:20,605 --> 00:43:25,101
For him who is restless...

436
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:28,764
life becomes a sore

437
00:43:41,751 --> 00:43:45,871
For those in love...

438
00:43:46,788 --> 00:43:53,159
life gets miserable

439
00:44:26,331 --> 00:44:28,661
How can one touch...

440
00:44:28,661 --> 00:44:31,574
the stars in the sky

441
00:44:31,576 --> 00:44:33,989
How can one forget...

442
00:44:33,989 --> 00:44:39,820
his sweetheart's words?

443
00:44:41,856 --> 00:44:44,603
Love offers...

444
00:44:44,605 --> 00:44:47,391
Loneliness and anxiety

445
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:49,764
The moment
I remember something...

446
00:44:49,766 --> 00:44:53,844
my eyes flow

447
00:44:53,844 --> 00:44:58,090
One who waits for a tomorrow...

448
00:44:58,715 --> 00:45:01,835
he makes his own life miserable

449
00:45:14,532 --> 00:45:18,987
He who is in love...

450
00:45:19,695 --> 00:45:26,067
makes his own life miserable

451
00:45:26,228 --> 00:45:29,056
How silly this heart is

452
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:31,681
It leaves one in a quandary

453
00:45:31,681 --> 00:45:35,594
For no reasons
it lays its trust on someone

454
00:46:22,755 --> 00:46:27,503
Hey brother!

455
00:46:34,286 --> 00:46:36,739
"He looks nice, doesn't he bhabhi?"

456
00:46:36,742 --> 00:46:39,447
I'm not going to talk to you.
I've been trying to contact you...

457
00:46:39,447 --> 00:46:41,777
since the last two months!
- I'm wearing a uniform!

458
00:46:41,777 --> 00:46:44,733
But you didn't send me a reply!
- How would I reply?

459
00:46:44,733 --> 00:46:46,896
I was not at the base.
- Where were you then?

460
00:46:46,898 --> 00:46:49,976
"I was at the border, flying my plane."
- How exciting!

461
00:46:49,978 --> 00:46:53,141
Exciting? I didn't have the time
to eat or drink or do something.

462
00:46:53,724 --> 00:46:56,762
What about the important thing
I wanted to tell you about?

463
00:46:56,764 --> 00:47:00,385
"Well, I got something to tell you too."
- Shoot!

464
00:47:02,757 --> 00:47:06,045
In everyone's presence?
"- That's right, come on."

465
00:47:06,753 --> 00:47:10,250
Where are you taking him? He just
arrived. Let him change and eat...

466
00:47:10,666 --> 00:47:13,704
"No, this is an emergency."
Come on.

467
00:47:13,704 --> 00:47:15,744
My uniform tie!
- Sit there.

468
00:47:15,744 --> 00:47:18,239
My badge...

469
00:47:18,242 --> 00:47:20,405
"Now tell me, what have you to say?"
- Your turn first.

470
00:47:20,407 --> 00:47:22,570
"No, you go first."
- No you.

471
00:47:22,572 --> 00:47:25,693
I think we both have the same things
to tell each other. But ladies first.

472
00:47:26,733 --> 00:47:30,728
But it's going to take time to finish.
- I'll take a nap then.

473
00:47:30,730 --> 00:47:34,099
I can sleep later.
- This is so interesting...

474
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:37,222
that you'll have a tough time
believing it.

475
00:47:37,222 --> 00:47:40,677
It happened when we performed
in Simla two months ago.

476
00:47:44,215 --> 00:47:48,045
After the show we danced
"and enjoyed so much, you know."

477
00:47:48,793 --> 00:47:53,873
And then I slept so much that
I woke up to find everyone gone.

478
00:47:54,373 --> 00:47:56,579
Those in the van thought I was on
the bus and those on the bus...

479
00:47:56,579 --> 00:47:59,324
thought I was in the van. And in
the confusion I'd been left behind.

480
00:47:59,326 --> 00:48:03,697
That very day we were to perform
at Manali. I didn't know what to do.

481
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:07,693
"Just then, I saw a helicopter"
land on the hotel lawn.

482
00:48:16,891 --> 00:48:19,846
Whose chopper is this?
- Mr. Karan Singhaniya's.

483
00:48:19,847 --> 00:48:25,510
Why?
"- Oh I was just curious, thank you."

484
00:48:27,132 --> 00:48:31,751
I'm Kajal. I am a friend
"of your boss, Mr. Karan Singhaniya."

485
00:48:40,034 --> 00:48:42,864
Karan and I were supposed to go to
Manali together. I am doing a show.

486
00:48:42,864 --> 00:48:45,945
And he's the chief guest.
You must be aware of all this.

487
00:48:45,945 --> 00:48:49,318
"Yes, I am."
- So will you be here long?

488
00:48:49,817 --> 00:48:53,106
"No, I am on my way to Delhi."
- Since Manali is on the way.

489
00:48:53,523 --> 00:48:56,934
Do you mind dropping me there?
"- No, I can't do that."

490
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:59,847
"If my boss gets to hear of it,"
I could lose my job.

491
00:48:59,847 --> 00:49:02,927
"What rubbish! Don't worry about that,"
I can explain things to Karan.

492
00:49:02,929 --> 00:49:05,882
But Miss Kajal...
- You ought to be delighted.

493
00:49:05,884 --> 00:49:09,588
"I will talk to Karan about you, and"
it can even fetch you a promotion.

494
00:49:09,588 --> 00:49:12,293
All right.

495
00:49:12,295 --> 00:49:14,623
Don't run away.

496
00:49:14,625 --> 00:49:18,288
I won't.

497
00:49:18,289 --> 00:49:23,076
My bluff worked. I was on my way
to Manali on the helicopter.

498
00:49:23,574 --> 00:49:26,820
But what did I see on the way?
The pilot was stealing glances at me.

499
00:49:27,322 --> 00:49:30,900
"Soon, I could stand it no longer."
I snapped at him.

500
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:36,353
Haven't you seen a girl before?

501
00:49:36,355 --> 00:49:38,226
What happened after that?
- As soon as I reached Manali...

502
00:49:38,228 --> 00:49:40,056
I slapped that Kamal.
- Kamal? Who?

503
00:49:40,059 --> 00:49:42,887
The same guy you beat up during
the rehearsal of the play.

504
00:49:42,889 --> 00:49:47,800
But the best part was something else.
Guess who was the chief guest?

505
00:49:48,175 --> 00:49:50,340
Who was it?
- Karan Singhaniya.

506
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:53,503
The owner of the helicopter?
- The owner was himself the pilot.

507
00:49:54,003 --> 00:49:56,581
What are you saying?
"- Raj, I got such a shock..."

508
00:49:56,583 --> 00:50:00,246
when the organizers invited him
on stage. There he was before me!

509
00:50:00,246 --> 00:50:02,576
Miss Kajal.
She directed this play.

510
00:50:02,577 --> 00:50:06,072
"And this is our chief guest,"
Mr. Karan Singhaniya.

511
00:50:06,074 --> 00:50:09,862
I hope you will talk
to my boss Mr. Eeshwar Singhaniya.

512
00:50:12,733 --> 00:50:14,898
You were having fun at my expense.
Couldn't you tell me...

513
00:50:14,898 --> 00:50:17,271
you were Karan Singhaniya?
- You never gave me an opportunity.

514
00:50:17,271 --> 00:50:21,806
What do you mean? Did I stick
a tape round your mouth?

515
00:50:21,806 --> 00:50:25,472
"I thought you were doing me a favour,"
when you were pulling my leg.

516
00:50:26,054 --> 00:50:30,047
"No, I wasn't. On the contrary..."

517
00:50:30,050 --> 00:50:33,380
I'm sorry I lied to you the other day.
"- No, you didn't lie."

518
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:39,628
"The fact is, you have become"
Karan Singhaniya's friend.

519
00:50:42,371 --> 00:50:46,867
May I ask you a favour?
Can I drop you back at Simla?

520
00:50:47,699 --> 00:50:52,485
"No, I am not going back to Simla."
"I'm headed home, Dehradun."

521
00:50:53,693 --> 00:50:57,771
It's on the way.

522
00:50:57,771 --> 00:51:01,018
Karan dropped me right here.
When the copter landed...

523
00:51:01,018 --> 00:51:05,014
all the boys came running to
"greet us. Manjit, Anurag, Raman..."

524
00:51:05,014 --> 00:51:07,096
everyone was stunned.

525
00:51:07,097 --> 00:51:09,344
"When I thanked Karan, he said,"
Won't you at least...

526
00:51:09,344 --> 00:51:12,007
offer me a cup of coffee
for dropping you here?

527
00:51:12,007 --> 00:51:14,713
I borrowed Manjit's cycle
to take him home.

528
00:51:14,713 --> 00:51:17,918
You seem to be the boss around here.
- They're all my friends.

529
00:51:18,458 --> 00:51:20,998
Is there a special friend among them?
"- I do, but he's away..."

530
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,079
undergoing training with the air force.
His name is Raj.

531
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:29,780
He is my best friend. We've been
friends since childhood.

532
00:51:29,782 --> 00:51:32,820
He's very fond of me.
He could die for me.

533
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:36,150
"When we reached home, my parents"
were so surprised at seeing Karan.

534
00:51:36,150 --> 00:51:43,186
But he won over everybody's heart.
He touched the elders' feet...

535
00:51:44,018 --> 00:51:47,347
even GI Joe's.

536
00:51:47,347 --> 00:51:49,552
Embrace me.

537
00:51:49,552 --> 00:51:52,757
He suggested some ayurvedic remedies
for grandma's pain in the knees.

538
00:51:52,759 --> 00:51:56,295
Gave father some Italian recipes
for his canteen.

539
00:51:56,297 --> 00:51:59,043
He even helped mummy
fry some pakoras.

540
00:51:59,045 --> 00:52:01,831
"Here, sir."
"- Wow son, in so many years..."

541
00:52:01,833 --> 00:52:04,496
we didn't realize we could use
the leaves from own backyard...

542
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:06,827
to make pakoras.
"- No, it's pathodas."

543
00:52:06,827 --> 00:52:09,449
"Yes, pakoras."
"- No aunt, it's pathodas."

544
00:52:09,449 --> 00:52:15,072
You know it's made of leaves.
(Patta - Leaf)

545
00:52:19,273 --> 00:52:22,103
"On Karan's invitation,"
Papa visited his house once.

546
00:52:22,105 --> 00:52:24,434
He couldn't stop talking about them
when he returned. He said...

547
00:52:24,434 --> 00:52:28,097
"They are so rich,"
and yet so humble.

548
00:52:28,099 --> 00:52:31,385
"Then, one day, Karan took me"
to the flying club.

549
00:52:31,929 --> 00:52:37,047
"Where, all his choppers"
were lined up.

550
00:52:37,047 --> 00:52:42,333
"Tell me, which chopper"
would you like to sit in?

551
00:52:42,333 --> 00:52:47,163
What do you call that red one?
- Cessna 172.

552
00:52:48,494 --> 00:52:54,242
That's the one.
"- Hop right in, then."

553
00:52:56,070 --> 00:53:01,190
In that big chopper he flew me across
the clouds. What a sight it was!

554
00:53:02,065 --> 00:53:05,186
"Really Raj, I had never seen"
such clouds before. Then he said...

555
00:53:12,014 --> 00:53:16,590
What did you tell him?

556
00:53:16,592 --> 00:53:19,920
What could I say?
My heart was pounding.

557
00:53:19,922 --> 00:53:23,126
I missed you so much that moment.
I thought...

558
00:53:23,126 --> 00:53:26,539
"if only you had been there,"
I'd have asked you for an answer.

559
00:53:26,539 --> 00:53:30,119
I told Karan just that.
- What did you say?

560
00:53:30,119 --> 00:53:34,197
That I can't say yes or no
without consulting Raj.

561
00:53:34,199 --> 00:53:39,610
"If I forbid you from marrying him,"
you won't marry Karan?

562
00:53:40,152 --> 00:53:43,563
I won't. Promise.
But at least meet him once.

563
00:53:43,565 --> 00:53:46,978
He is so nice that
"you won't forbid me, believe me."

564
00:53:46,978 --> 00:53:49,556
Now that I have told you about
"my wedding, you tell me..."

565
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:52,887
what did you want to tell me?
"- About your wedding, of course."

566
00:53:52,889 --> 00:53:58,594
When can I meet him?
- You mean it?

567
00:53:59,965 --> 00:54:06,378
Then we'll meet him right away.
Let's go. Come on.

568
00:54:18,862 --> 00:54:24,195
What happened?
- I'll go and freshen up.

569
00:54:35,387 --> 00:54:38,717
Kajal talks a lot about you.
She's very fond of you.

570
00:54:39,384 --> 00:54:42,088
She respects you a lot.
"- Yes, I know."

571
00:54:42,090 --> 00:54:45,293
"My life is in your hands now, sir."
Only you can help me.

572
00:54:45,710 --> 00:54:49,414
"I'm a nice guy, and I come from"
a very good family. I promise you...

573
00:54:49,414 --> 00:54:52,577
I will not let Kajal down. Never.

574
00:54:52,579 --> 00:54:55,951
My folks and I will always
take good care of Kajal.

575
00:54:58,364 --> 00:55:01,735
"Honestly, I dearly love Kajal, sir."

576
00:55:01,737 --> 00:55:05,315
She loves me too.
"As for me, I can't live without her."

577
00:55:07,023 --> 00:55:10,101
"If I don't have Kajal,"
I will die.

578
00:55:10,103 --> 00:55:14,724
"So please put in a kind word for me,"
or Kajal will not marry me.

579
00:55:17,096 --> 00:55:19,760
It's you Karan!

580
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:23,422
I hope you aren't bribing Raj?
- He doesn't need to.

581
00:55:23,422 --> 00:55:26,418
You can't get a better
life-partner than Karan.

582
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:32,251
"Oh sir, thank you so much."

583
00:56:52,501 --> 00:56:55,496
If you love someone...

584
00:56:55,498 --> 00:56:58,159
say it...

585
00:56:58,161 --> 00:57:04,030
before it's too late

586
00:57:04,030 --> 00:57:06,943
If you trust someone...

587
00:57:06,945 --> 00:57:09,731
say it...

588
00:57:09,733 --> 00:57:15,938
before it's too late

589
00:57:16,601 --> 00:57:20,847
That's the secret to steal a heart

590
00:58:14,376 --> 00:58:16,581
The pain love inflicts...

591
00:58:16,583 --> 00:58:20,244
"the more it hurts,"
the more you seek

592
00:58:20,246 --> 00:58:24,532
But it's beyond one's comprehension

593
00:58:25,907 --> 00:58:28,612
My beloved...

594
00:58:28,612 --> 00:58:31,608
is a trifle merciless

595
00:58:31,610 --> 00:58:35,938
She takes pleasure in tormenting me

596
00:58:37,271 --> 00:58:41,931
"Yet, my heart is proud"
of my beloved

597
00:58:44,637 --> 00:58:47,634
If you love someone...

598
00:58:47,635 --> 00:58:50,630
express it...

599
00:58:50,632 --> 00:58:57,045
before it's too late

600
00:59:20,686 --> 00:59:23,681
It's a time to celebrate

601
00:59:23,681 --> 00:59:26,679
"A joyous occasion, indeed"

602
00:59:26,679 --> 00:59:30,967
It's the sign
of joyous events to come

603
00:59:32,047 --> 00:59:34,838
It shows in the eyes

604
00:59:34,838 --> 00:59:38,001
That's the wonder of love

605
00:59:38,001 --> 00:59:41,956
Love can never be hidden

606
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:47,992
Love is a secret
that only the eyes reveal

607
00:59:51,030 --> 00:59:53,693
If you love someone...

608
00:59:53,695 --> 00:59:56,690
express it...

609
00:59:56,692 --> 01:00:02,643
before it's too late

610
01:00:02,643 --> 01:00:05,099
If you trust someone...

611
01:00:05,099 --> 01:00:08,221
say it...

612
01:00:08,222 --> 01:00:14,552
before it's too late

613
01:00:15,005 --> 01:00:20,043
That's the secret to steal a heart

614
01:01:04,414 --> 01:01:08,159
"Bhabhi, why did Raj quit the party?"

615
01:01:08,161 --> 01:01:10,907
Why don't you answer me?
"Tell me, for my sake please."

616
01:01:10,909 --> 01:01:14,697
What do I say?
Raj madly loves you.

617
01:01:15,195 --> 01:01:20,818
He wanted to marry you.

618
01:01:49,827 --> 01:01:55,659
"Tears of joy, you know."
I'm so happy that...

619
01:01:57,320 --> 01:02:00,483
Why didn't you tell me before?

620
01:02:00,483 --> 01:02:03,771
Tell what?
- That you love me.

621
01:02:07,309 --> 01:02:11,054
I never felt the need to tell you.

622
01:02:11,056 --> 01:02:16,009
I thought it was plain enough
for you to see.

623
01:02:16,010 --> 01:02:19,838
It is rightly said that...

624
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:25,750
a book that is too close to your eyes
cannot be read.

625
01:02:27,331 --> 01:02:32,746
I'm so stupid.

626
01:02:34,199 --> 01:02:38,777
Would you tell me something?
- What?

627
01:02:41,150 --> 01:02:47,186
"Had I proposed you first,"
would your reply have been yes?

628
01:02:49,476 --> 01:02:56,177
Why do you ask me now Raj?
- I won't be at peace till I know.

629
01:02:58,092 --> 01:03:00,880
Neither will you after you know.

630
01:03:00,882 --> 01:03:05,793
"The truth is, I myself don't know."
I never thought about it before.

631
01:03:07,251 --> 01:03:11,911
And it'd be a sin to think of it now.

632
01:03:11,911 --> 01:03:16,905
But don't think that
I'd be spared once I'm away.

633
01:03:16,907 --> 01:03:21,237
"If you hurt yourself, I'll be"
"hurt, too. Remember this much."

634
01:03:32,016 --> 01:03:36,387
The world does not come to an end
if a loved one leaves you.

635
01:03:36,387 --> 01:03:41,257
And if that makes for an excuse
to ruin your own life...

636
01:03:42,547 --> 01:03:47,460
that'd be an insult to your love
and to the one who has left you.

637
01:03:48,916 --> 01:03:53,869
I'm sure you won't ever insult me.
Take care of yourself.

638
01:03:54,911 --> 01:04:00,367
Get a hold on yourself.

639
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:36,992
There's joy in my eyes...

640
01:04:36,994 --> 01:04:39,989
yet my heart weeps

641
01:04:39,989 --> 01:04:44,320
"Oh, what crossroads"
has love brought me to?

642
01:04:45,318 --> 01:04:50,273
"Yes, it's a secret to endure pain"

643
01:05:43,969 --> 01:05:49,800
"Raj, your brother and bhabhi"
are here.

644
01:05:54,416 --> 01:05:57,536
Fine brother. What brings you here?
- We're on our way back from a seminar

645
01:05:57,538 --> 01:06:01,034
We thought we'd drop in.
"Tell me something, officer..."

646
01:06:01,034 --> 01:06:04,197
have you sworn not to come home?
"- Not at all, brother."

647
01:06:04,199 --> 01:06:07,110
There is so much work here...
- Cut the crap.

648
01:06:07,112 --> 01:06:11,023
You will come home
during the next vacation.

649
01:06:11,025 --> 01:06:15,231
We don't like it without you there.

650
01:06:16,018 --> 01:06:19,181
"Kiran, where are the sweets?"

651
01:06:19,184 --> 01:06:21,139
In the car.
- I'll get them.

652
01:06:21,139 --> 01:06:26,467
Left my favorite stuff in the car?
"- Take him to task, Kiran."

653
01:06:26,469 --> 01:06:30,380
"Take a seat, bhabhi."

654
01:06:30,380 --> 01:06:35,001
"You know Raj, why your brother got"
himself transferred to Nainital?

655
01:06:36,041 --> 01:06:38,536
So that you don't have to travel
all the way to Dehradun.

656
01:06:38,538 --> 01:06:42,034
"I know, bhabhi."

657
01:06:42,036 --> 01:06:46,364
He doesn't want you to be reminded
of the past and hurt yourself.

658
01:06:48,362 --> 01:06:55,980
Yet you make him sad. You neither
come home nor reply to my letters.

659
01:06:56,271 --> 01:06:59,393
"Bhabhi, all you do in the letters"
is ask me to marry.

660
01:06:59,601 --> 01:07:04,849
I don't want to marry.

661
01:07:10,090 --> 01:07:16,001
"All right, I will do just as you say,"
but please stop weeping.

662
01:07:16,251 --> 01:07:19,746
Wipe your tears.
My friends are watching.

663
01:07:19,748 --> 01:07:23,077
"You won't change your mind,"
"will you, Raj?"

664
01:07:23,077 --> 01:07:25,117
No more turning back in life.

665
01:07:25,117 --> 01:07:29,445
"Here are the sweets. Tell me, have"
you fixed the date for coming home?

666
01:07:30,112 --> 01:07:34,481
I'll be in Europe for 6 to 8 weeks
"on a Sea-Harrier training, brother."

667
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:40,521
"As soon as I return,"
I'll come home.

668
01:08:31,509 --> 01:08:33,631
No good being in a foreign land
all these days.

669
01:08:33,631 --> 01:08:35,671
What do you mean?
- We haven't gone sightseeing.

670
01:08:35,671 --> 01:08:38,707
"I mean, no women and wine..."
"- He's right. Come on, let's go."

671
01:08:38,710 --> 01:08:42,456
It's New Year's Eve. Must celebrate.
"- All right, let's go to the disco."

672
01:08:42,706 --> 01:08:46,203
"Wow, that's a great idea."
- Even the toughest one has ideas!

673
01:08:46,203 --> 01:08:50,114
Busted! His little secret
has been discovered.

674
01:09:17,212 --> 01:09:23,042
"Monty, let go. What are you doing?"

675
01:09:30,742 --> 01:09:33,694
"Same for him, please."
What are you staring at?

676
01:09:33,697 --> 01:09:36,194
Haven't you seen a girl booze?

677
01:09:36,194 --> 01:09:40,149
"Actually, I don't usually drink."
But today is New Year's Eve.

678
01:09:40,398 --> 01:09:43,520
So I thought I'd live it up.
I'd try something new.

679
01:09:48,265 --> 01:09:53,096
"You see, tonight..."

680
01:09:55,259 --> 01:10:00,587
"I'm slightly drunk. When I drink,"
it hits me very fast.

681
01:10:00,752 --> 01:10:04,247
Aren't you stoned?

682
01:10:04,250 --> 01:10:08,411
A torn pocket!

683
01:10:08,412 --> 01:10:11,576
I suppose you don't know this
is in fashion these days.

684
01:10:12,948 --> 01:10:16,569
It's an Armani jacket.
- It's now a typical Sindhi jacket!

685
01:10:17,444 --> 01:10:20,608
"Listen, please give me your residence"
"number, telephone number, everything."

686
01:10:21,814 --> 01:10:25,645
"Mr. Never Mind, give me your address."
I will send you a jacket.

687
01:10:26,310 --> 01:10:29,430
"Lay off, Monty. Monty your dad may"
be my father's business partner...

688
01:10:29,431 --> 01:10:33,511
but that doesn't give you
the right over me. Let me go!

689
01:10:34,970 --> 01:10:39,841
Or I'll smash your head.

690
01:11:12,305 --> 01:11:15,095
"Come on, get the hell out of here!"
- Where are you taking me?

691
01:11:15,095 --> 01:11:19,340
Listen to me...
what are you doing?

692
01:11:19,341 --> 01:11:22,337
You got a car?

693
01:11:22,337 --> 01:11:24,377
Where's the car?

694
01:11:24,377 --> 01:11:27,707
Where's the car?
I don't know. Where's the car?

695
01:11:28,372 --> 01:11:31,703
Where's the key?
- Keys? Are you drunk?

696
01:11:32,368 --> 01:11:35,698
Why?
- Because when there is no car...

697
01:11:36,364 --> 01:11:39,362
what will you do with the keys?
- All right.

698
01:11:39,363 --> 01:11:43,358
Just give me the keys
and I'll find your car.

699
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:48,189
Take this.

700
01:11:48,354 --> 01:11:52,978
Got it. Come on.

701
01:11:54,015 --> 01:11:59,716
I must say you are intelligent.
"Both, brave and intelligent."

702
01:12:00,381 --> 01:12:04,046
You're not drunk either.

703
01:12:04,046 --> 01:12:09,332
"Unlike others, who get drunk easily"
and lose their senses.

704
01:12:11,872 --> 01:12:15,702
"Excuse me, where do you think"
you're taking my girlfriend?

705
01:12:16,367 --> 01:12:19,698
I'm not your girlfriend.
I am going with him.

706
01:12:21,362 --> 01:12:25,689
"Hey you, Torn-Pocket!"

707
01:12:25,692 --> 01:12:29,685
The winner takes Jiya with him.

708
01:12:29,688 --> 01:12:35,350
You win. Take the girl.

709
01:12:40,426 --> 01:12:42,921
Who's this soiled-shorts?
- It's spoilsport! Spoilsport!

710
01:12:42,922 --> 01:12:47,417
That's right!
"Never mind, darling."

711
01:12:47,420 --> 01:12:52,252
I'm off.

712
01:13:04,777 --> 01:13:09,104
"Madam, where do you have to go?"
- Wherever you take me.

713
01:13:09,104 --> 01:13:15,806
Tell me your address.
"- Address? Go straight, straight..."

714
01:13:17,055 --> 01:13:23,304
Drive straight.

715
01:13:27,462 --> 01:13:30,832
Monty! My brother is here!

716
01:13:30,835 --> 01:13:37,247
What are you up to? Stay down.
- Let go.

717
01:13:41,282 --> 01:13:47,279
Brother Monty!
- Stay down. You'll fall.

718
01:13:56,475 --> 01:14:02,930
Brother Monty is here!
Brother Monty!

719
01:14:28,028 --> 01:14:33,443
Brother Monty is punctured!

720
01:14:41,555 --> 01:14:44,051
"Madam, listen to me. You'll fall."

721
01:14:44,051 --> 01:14:46,716
Where's your house?
- It was right here this morning.

722
01:14:46,716 --> 01:14:50,505
Here?
- The flood might've drowned it.

723
01:14:51,545 --> 01:14:55,707
Goodbye.

724
01:14:55,707 --> 01:15:02,868
You're not only brave and
"intelligent, you're handsome too."

725
01:15:32,587 --> 01:15:36,500
You didn't seem to remember the way
"to your house, so I brought you home."

726
01:15:36,667 --> 01:15:39,872
"Your clothes were wet,"
so I helped you get into mine.

727
01:15:39,872 --> 01:15:42,911
Or you could've caught pneumonia.
I washed your clothes...

728
01:15:43,077 --> 01:15:46,113
"in the washing machine, ironed them,"
and there they are...

729
01:15:46,114 --> 01:15:48,612
hanging to your left.
Take a look.

730
01:15:48,613 --> 01:15:51,944
"There's milk, bread and butter in the"
refrigerator in case you're hungry.

731
01:15:52,193 --> 01:15:55,148
"Don't use the toaster,"
you might get an electric shock.

732
01:15:55,149 --> 01:15:58,644
"Your car is parked outside,"
and the keys are near the computer.

733
01:15:58,645 --> 01:16:02,640
Goodbye. Raj.

734
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:06,636
The handwriting suggests
he's very intelligent.

735
01:16:06,636 --> 01:16:09,925
Look at the size of the shirt.
He seems so tall.

736
01:16:09,926 --> 01:16:16,340
"Tell me, how does he look?"
- Very handsome.

737
01:16:16,627 --> 01:16:19,788
"Tell us, what else did he do?"
- Nothing at all.

738
01:16:19,791 --> 01:16:24,078
Must've kissed you.
"- No, he isn't that type."

739
01:16:24,828 --> 01:16:28,613
How can that be? He changed your
"clothes, yet he didn't do a thing?"

740
01:16:28,782 --> 01:16:33,238
Nothing.

741
01:16:33,652 --> 01:16:37,604
Such boys are rare these days.
- I'd have married him.

742
01:16:37,773 --> 01:16:42,729
Why not me?

743
01:16:53,421 --> 01:16:56,292
"After coming to, at home,"
I realized that...

744
01:16:56,295 --> 01:16:58,875
I'd forgotten something very
valuable at your place.

745
01:16:58,876 --> 01:17:04,621
"If you find it, please call me"
on this number... 6399400 Jiya.

746
01:17:04,746 --> 01:17:08,823
Now what has she forgotten?

747
01:17:08,823 --> 01:17:11,404
"I'm sorry, there's no jewellery"
of yours here.

748
01:17:11,404 --> 01:17:14,069
There could be something
much more precious.

749
01:17:14,069 --> 01:17:18,024
What do you mean?
- I couldn't even thank you properly.

750
01:17:18,689 --> 01:17:21,269
I want to meet you to
express my gratitude.

751
01:17:21,270 --> 01:17:24,059
Not necessary. You've already
sent me a bouquet.

752
01:17:24,060 --> 01:17:27,720
You've expressed your gratitude.
So forget it. Okay?

753
01:17:27,721 --> 01:17:30,719
It takes one last rendezvous
to forget things.

754
01:17:30,720 --> 01:17:35,047
Will you please come home?
"- Look, I have no time. Bye."

755
01:17:59,689 --> 01:18:04,564
Hear that? And you don't believe it?

756
01:18:07,765 --> 01:18:10,261
"Some call me sexy,"
others call me beautiful.

757
01:18:10,261 --> 01:18:12,260
How come you don't see it in me?
Are you blind?

758
01:18:12,261 --> 01:18:17,176
"Or, do you have a problem...?"

759
01:18:19,171 --> 01:18:24,082
"Ask me how pretty you are, how sexy"
you are. How'd that moron know?

760
01:18:24,247 --> 01:18:30,578
"He's not a player, after all."
- It's connoisseur!

761
01:19:16,822 --> 01:19:19,318
What do you want?
- Just one date.

762
01:19:19,319 --> 01:19:21,939
Why?
- It's my birthday today.

763
01:19:21,942 --> 01:19:24,813
Won't you come home for dinner?

764
01:19:24,814 --> 01:19:27,810
"You will come, won't you?"
- Okay.

765
01:19:27,810 --> 01:19:31,305
My place!

766
01:19:31,305 --> 01:19:33,304
"All right, I will come."
- Oh thank you...

767
01:19:33,305 --> 01:19:38,261
Enough.

768
01:20:03,858 --> 01:20:06,438
Hi. I hope I didn't keep you waiting.

769
01:20:06,439 --> 01:20:10,185
I wouldn't mind waiting forever
to catch one glimpse of you.

770
01:20:10,850 --> 01:20:15,761
I hope you have no more complaints?
- I wouldn't dare complain about you.

771
01:20:16,179 --> 01:20:19,800
"If you wish to betray me,"
go ahead and do it.

772
01:20:20,881 --> 01:20:24,295
But I've put my heart and soul
at your feet.

773
01:20:24,296 --> 01:20:30,710
Be my God of Love.

774
01:20:30,872 --> 01:20:34,867
It's a power cut.
I'd better leave.

775
01:20:34,868 --> 01:20:36,863
The electricity will be back.

776
01:20:36,864 --> 01:20:39,987
Do not grieve over the lights
that are put out.

777
01:20:39,988 --> 01:20:45,403
My eyes shall burn all night.

778
01:20:47,314 --> 01:20:52,225
Why do you wish to play with fire?
You will burn.

779
01:20:54,930 --> 01:21:01,259
"I'm but a lump of wax. Consume me,"
turn me into a fireball.

780
01:21:02,256 --> 01:21:06,421
Let the warmth of your breath spread
all over me. Burn me to my soul.

781
01:21:09,916 --> 01:21:14,246
Shower on me...
let my thirst of years be quenched.

782
01:21:41,301 --> 01:21:44,506
"Tonight, the showers will be fun"

783
01:21:44,965 --> 01:21:48,295
Our sweet meeting will be fun

784
01:21:53,372 --> 01:21:56,868
This sweet meeting of ours
will be fun

785
01:22:05,404 --> 01:22:09,314
I had been holding myself back

786
01:22:13,978 --> 01:22:17,306
"The moment you gazed at me,"
I lost my composure

787
01:22:17,974 --> 01:22:23,805
Your gaze...

788
01:22:26,297 --> 01:22:32,796
"robbed my very being,"
O stranger

789
01:22:55,020 --> 01:22:58,350
Amazing is a beauty
drenched all over

790
01:22:59,225 --> 01:23:02,345
"Her body,"
bedazzling

791
01:23:03,386 --> 01:23:07,381
Amazing is the monsoon

792
01:23:07,381 --> 01:23:10,962
And the showers make you sweat...
it dazes me

793
01:23:13,336 --> 01:23:16,372
The passionate urge
on my lips...

794
01:23:17,247 --> 01:23:20,993
"is to quench your thirst,"
my love

795
01:23:21,533 --> 01:23:24,988
When the clouds burst
to shower down heavy drops...

796
01:23:25,448 --> 01:23:29,359
"my beloved, an urge"
to embrace you overcomes me

797
01:23:38,559 --> 01:23:41,639
"Your ways, O cruel one..."

798
01:23:46,509 --> 01:23:50,131
makes me lose my patience

799
01:23:50,755 --> 01:23:56,920
You set your eyes upon mine...

800
01:23:58,662 --> 01:24:02,411
"and robbed my very being,"
O stranger

801
01:24:31,965 --> 01:24:35,420
Hold me in your eyes...
wait no more

802
01:24:35,917 --> 01:24:39,416
Bridge this gap...
wait no more

803
01:24:40,122 --> 01:24:43,452
Give me a place in your heart...
wait no more

804
01:24:44,203 --> 01:24:47,448
Embrace me...
wait no more

805
01:24:50,154 --> 01:24:53,484
Of late I've been very restless

806
01:24:53,734 --> 01:24:57,479
But I've been waiting
for this day since years

807
01:24:58,145 --> 01:25:01,475
"If you try to stop me,"
I shall cross all limits

808
01:25:02,143 --> 01:25:05,720
"If you make me pine any longer,"
I'd die

809
01:25:19,085 --> 01:25:22,537
We shall thirst forever...

810
01:25:23,206 --> 01:25:26,908
should this season pass

811
01:25:31,529 --> 01:25:35,109
I had been holding myself back

812
01:25:35,649 --> 01:25:39,104
"The moment you gazed at me,"
I lost my composure

813
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:47,096
You set my eyes upon mine...

814
01:25:47,639 --> 01:25:51,466
"and robbed my very being,"
O stranger

815
01:26:13,654 --> 01:26:18,189
Did he come finally?
"- Yes, he did..."

816
01:26:18,192 --> 01:26:20,645
but only in my dreams.

817
01:26:20,645 --> 01:26:23,728
You girls scared him off.
- I don't think he's interested.

818
01:26:24,269 --> 01:26:28,180
Forget him.

819
01:26:28,180 --> 01:26:33,216
I'm not the one to forget.

820
01:26:33,216 --> 01:26:37,962
Why's everyone so quiet?
Where's Raj? Where's he?

821
01:26:38,502 --> 01:26:41,626
Do you expect us to reveal
our friend's secrets?

822
01:26:42,207 --> 01:26:44,456
What do you mean?
- You want his friends to save him?

823
01:26:44,457 --> 01:26:49,323
"Let him down, Rounaq!"
- I know.

824
01:26:49,326 --> 01:26:54,158
"If you insist, I'll tell you."
Raj has gone to India.

825
01:26:54,404 --> 01:26:59,529
Had some work there. But if I can
"help you in any way, do tell me."

826
01:27:05,978 --> 01:27:09,265
Has she left?
- The disaster you couldn't avert...

827
01:27:09,265 --> 01:27:13,511
"for days, I staved it off at one go."
This week's training will be no sore.

828
01:27:14,051 --> 01:27:18,462
It takes an ass like me
only one shot to hit the target.

829
01:27:18,462 --> 01:27:24,877
For the first time
you got the idiom right.

830
01:27:27,412 --> 01:27:30,283
"This is London's Buckingham palace,"
and this is...

831
01:27:30,283 --> 01:27:35,701
"Papa, uncle is here!"

832
01:27:39,984 --> 01:27:42,773
Won't you come to me?

833
01:27:42,774 --> 01:27:47,265
"See Mummy, what a nice doll"
uncle has bought for me.

834
01:27:47,268 --> 01:27:50,806
It's beautiful.
- I'm famished. I'll take a bath...

835
01:27:53,930 --> 01:27:57,675
"Don't go upstairs,"
"you take this room, here."

836
01:27:57,676 --> 01:28:02,252
What have you done to my room?
- You know we've kept a paying guest.

837
01:28:02,252 --> 01:28:05,707
A paying guest? Why my room?
"- Raj, that room is always locked."

838
01:28:06,500 --> 01:28:09,996
"Your brother goes to college,"
while I give tuitions.

839
01:28:10,787 --> 01:28:14,242
Shelly used to feel bored at home.
But now she has got good company.

840
01:28:14,742 --> 01:28:18,072
"She isn't just good, she's great."
You'll be stunned.

841
01:28:20,319 --> 01:28:25,568
"Good, Shelly has got company..."

842
01:28:26,104 --> 01:28:28,935
Greetings.

843
01:28:28,935 --> 01:28:33,221
It was only an expression. That
doesn't mean you keep gaping at her.

844
01:28:36,801 --> 01:28:40,256
How did you reach here?
- I first took a flight...

845
01:28:40,256 --> 01:28:43,712
"then a train, a bus"
and an auto rickshaw.

846
01:28:44,252 --> 01:28:45,917
"I can't tell you, but it"
was quite a bumpy ride.

847
01:28:45,917 --> 01:28:48,747
So you know her?
- Yes brother.

848
01:28:48,750 --> 01:28:51,746
I know this girl very well.
"- Very well, my foot."

849
01:28:51,747 --> 01:28:54,451
You returned to India even before
"you could get to know me, didn't you?"

850
01:28:54,452 --> 01:28:57,073
Hardly matters. Now that
you'll be living together...

851
01:28:57,073 --> 01:29:00,069
you will get to know each other well.
"- Right, brother."

852
01:29:00,069 --> 01:29:03,358
She calls you brother?
- So what? God bless you.

853
01:29:03,359 --> 01:29:06,354
"She's a very nice girl, Raj."
Despite staying abroad...

854
01:29:06,354 --> 01:29:09,435
"for so many years, she hasn't"
forgotten our culture and traditions.

855
01:29:09,435 --> 01:29:14,644
She has won us over.

856
01:29:16,261 --> 01:29:22,176
Culture! She could
sell this country off!

857
01:29:22,506 --> 01:29:25,962
Why have you come to my house?
- I came to meet you...

858
01:29:26,377 --> 01:29:31,331
on the pretext of returning
your shirt. I lied to your brother...

859
01:29:32,872 --> 01:29:35,783
Just shut up! I don't like
these tricks of yours. Understand?

860
01:29:35,783 --> 01:29:38,698
But bhabhi likes not only
"my behavior, she also likes me."

861
01:29:38,698 --> 01:29:41,778
That's because she's yet to meet
the real you. Shall I tell her...

862
01:29:41,779 --> 01:29:44,443
in what condition I found you
at the disco? Stoned!

863
01:29:44,444 --> 01:29:47,939
"Sure, tell them. Also tell them"
that you carried me to your room...

864
01:29:48,439 --> 01:29:51,225
"took off all my clothes,"
laid me down on your bed...

865
01:29:51,228 --> 01:29:52,809
and God knows what all you did to me!
- Shut up!

866
01:29:52,810 --> 01:29:56,220
I was drunk. All you gave me was
this shirt to cover my body.

867
01:29:56,221 --> 01:30:01,509
I can prove it!
Bhabhi!

868
01:30:01,510 --> 01:30:04,421
Aren't you ashamed? Don't you care
even a wee bit about your honour?

869
01:30:04,422 --> 01:30:08,417
"Kid, my honour lies in yours."

870
01:30:08,420 --> 01:30:11,791
"If I lose it, you will lose it too."
"- Lose what, eh?"

871
01:30:12,832 --> 01:30:14,412
Give me my shirt.

872
01:30:14,412 --> 01:30:16,202
Raj...?

873
01:30:16,203 --> 01:30:19,948
What's going on here?
"- Nothing, I was..."

874
01:30:21,448 --> 01:30:25,774
You're leaving
your shirt behind once again.

875
01:30:25,777 --> 01:30:29,439
How about leaving my dress behind?

876
01:30:29,439 --> 01:30:34,559
Insolence! Take that.

877
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:37,055
"Come on, let's have tea together."

878
01:30:37,056 --> 01:30:39,429
The potato and cabbage dish
"is great, Raj."

879
01:30:39,430 --> 01:30:42,551
"Bhabhi, give me some more. Else,"
he'll lose his temper for no reason.

880
01:30:45,797 --> 01:30:49,417
I just love this rumaali roti.
I really missed it.

881
01:30:49,420 --> 01:30:52,707
Why don't you get married? You can
have rumaali rotis everyday.

882
01:30:53,500 --> 01:30:57,037
"Listen, you were supposed to find"
a girl for him. What progress?

883
01:30:57,662 --> 01:31:01,408
I'd find a girl for him today itself.
But will he marry the girl I choose?

884
01:31:01,948 --> 01:31:05,569
Why won't he? Won't I break
the moron's legs?

885
01:31:05,569 --> 01:31:11,395
"I will, on one condition. She"
should be a great cook like bhabhi.

886
01:31:11,398 --> 01:31:17,140
Jiya was the one who cooked today.

887
01:31:17,140 --> 01:31:20,470
"So you are out uncle, clean bowled?"
- Eat quietly.

888
01:31:20,471 --> 01:31:23,385
Children don't talk while eating.
"Bhabhi, is this some lentil curry?"

889
01:31:23,386 --> 01:31:29,259
There's no salt in it. Why don't you
check it out for yourself?

890
01:31:29,546 --> 01:31:33,792
"Miss Jiya, where's my book?"

891
01:32:03,679 --> 01:32:06,341
"Hey you! You were peeping on me,"
weren't you? Say yes or no.

892
01:32:06,341 --> 01:32:08,546
I didn't see a thing.
- You did.

893
01:32:08,547 --> 01:32:11,880
"I saw nothing. Okay, I'm sorry."
"- Sorry won't work, mister."

894
01:32:12,545 --> 01:32:15,541
Well...?
- Say that you like me.

895
01:32:15,542 --> 01:32:18,328
But I didn't see anything.
- No? Then see now.

896
01:32:18,331 --> 01:32:20,536
"Miss Jiya, what are you doing?"

897
01:32:20,537 --> 01:32:24,323
Bhabhi is coming. Shall I tell her
that you were watching me bathe?

898
01:32:24,323 --> 01:32:26,197
What?
- I didn't see anything.

899
01:32:26,198 --> 01:32:29,484
I even apologized.
- Nothing doing. Say you like me.

900
01:32:30,609 --> 01:32:32,605
No.
- No?

901
01:32:32,608 --> 01:32:34,604
"I do, I do."

902
01:32:34,604 --> 01:32:37,600
Yes? Or no?
- Yes.

903
01:32:37,603 --> 01:32:40,850
"If yes, say lovingly"
that I like you.

904
01:32:42,596 --> 01:32:45,636
"Yes, I like you."
"- Raj, where are you?"

905
01:32:45,636 --> 01:32:47,591
Bhabhi is coming here.
- Where do I hide?

906
01:32:47,591 --> 01:32:49,381
Here.
- How can I hide there?

907
01:32:49,381 --> 01:32:52,587
Come on!
Hold the towel.

908
01:32:52,587 --> 01:32:54,585
Jiya...
- Yes bhabhi?

909
01:32:54,586 --> 01:32:57,582
Have you seen Raj anywhere?
- No bhabhi. Isn't he in his room?

910
01:32:57,582 --> 01:32:59,912
"He's not there, he's not"
even downstairs.

911
01:32:59,912 --> 01:33:03,161
"Then, he may be behind the towel..."
"I mean, he may be in the bathroom."

912
01:33:03,618 --> 01:33:08,613
"All right, I'll check."

913
01:33:08,613 --> 01:33:10,944
What happened?
- I couldn't even breathe.

914
01:33:10,944 --> 01:33:15,564
"Finally you accept that you like me,"
"don't you? So, did you enjoy that?"

915
01:33:17,229 --> 01:33:20,600
No.
- No? Then try again.

916
01:33:20,600 --> 01:33:22,724
Insolence!

917
01:33:22,725 --> 01:33:26,679
It was because of bhabhi
that I came under pressure.

918
01:33:26,680 --> 01:33:30,550
"Under pressure, or under threat,"
at least you accepted?

919
01:33:31,006 --> 01:33:35,336
Insolent girl!

920
01:33:35,337 --> 01:33:37,667
One minute.
- I want to eat Roshan's ice-cream.

921
01:33:37,667 --> 01:33:39,791
Let's go.

922
01:33:39,792 --> 01:33:43,078
"You Towel Girl, get off!"
You're not going with us.

923
01:33:43,537 --> 01:33:46,576
Get off!
- I'm not dying to go with you.

924
01:33:47,076 --> 01:33:49,738
But bhabhi asked me to fetch some
things for the Karva Chauth festival.

925
01:33:49,738 --> 01:33:52,779
"Well, if I don't,"
it won't rent the skies.

926
01:33:53,319 --> 01:33:56,730
"But bhabhi won't complete her fast,"
she'll remain hungry...

927
01:33:56,733 --> 01:34:00,060
"she'll lose her temper,"
and take it out on her husband.

928
01:34:00,063 --> 01:34:02,643
And they are going to brawl.

929
01:34:02,644 --> 01:34:05,015
So what? Why do I bother? Bye.
- Get lost

930
01:34:05,015 --> 01:34:08,180
"Jiya, you guys haven't gone yet?"
"- Bhabhi, Raj doesn't want..."

931
01:34:08,636 --> 01:34:11,716
"Come, sit."
- What did you say?

932
01:34:11,716 --> 01:34:17,840
"Come madam, sit."
Let's go and do some shopping.

933
01:34:22,707 --> 01:34:25,493
What are you doing?
- What am I doing?

934
01:34:25,496 --> 01:34:28,364
Take your hands off!
- What shall I hold then?

935
01:34:28,367 --> 01:34:30,698
Hold your hips.

936
01:34:30,698 --> 01:34:33,069
"If I don't hold on to you,"
I may fall down.

937
01:34:33,069 --> 01:34:35,693
So fall then.
"- If I fall, we won't buy anything."

938
01:34:35,694 --> 01:34:38,773
Bhabhi won't be able to complete
"her fast, which may result in a brawl."

939
01:34:38,774 --> 01:34:42,185
And if husband and wife quarrel...
"- For heavens' sake, quit blabbering."

940
01:34:42,685 --> 01:34:48,350
Always rambling.
Just shut up.

941
01:35:16,694 --> 01:35:19,983
Get off.
These types don't get off easily.

942
01:35:23,770 --> 01:35:27,434
"Lay off. Go, do the shopping."
Move it.

943
01:35:44,750 --> 01:35:48,078
"Madam, they are gone."
"- Thank you so much, brother."

944
01:35:48,078 --> 01:35:51,864
Shall we...?
- Where to?

945
01:35:51,867 --> 01:35:56,029
"We were going to Delhi, but you"
"stopped us. Come on, let's enjoy."

946
01:36:00,942 --> 01:36:04,020
Take her! Come on.

947
01:36:04,020 --> 01:36:07,975
"Uncle, sister..."

948
01:36:07,975 --> 01:36:11,761
"Let go! Let go, I say!"

949
01:36:11,764 --> 01:36:15,135
What's your problem?
- You think you are a hero?

950
01:36:15,760 --> 01:36:21,216
Get lost!
"Come on take her, guys."

951
01:36:59,425 --> 01:37:04,381
"Very good, uncle"

952
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:07,872
Wasn't it great?

953
01:37:07,872 --> 01:37:12,207
Uncle...

954
01:37:36,511 --> 01:37:39,301
Stop your uncle.
Or my friend will be a dead man soon.

955
01:37:39,301 --> 01:37:43,627
"If you want to hit,"
hit me.

956
01:37:43,630 --> 01:37:46,792
Leave him.
"- You love to tease girls, don't you?"

957
01:37:54,412 --> 01:38:00,654
"Uncle, he'll die. Stop it."

958
01:38:00,654 --> 01:38:06,189
Pick him up!
Take your father away

959
01:38:06,189 --> 01:38:09,520
"I know you love me, or why"
would you fight for me like this?

960
01:38:09,935 --> 01:38:14,770
"Tell me, yes or no?"

961
01:38:15,180 --> 01:38:18,969
Because of your disgusting behavior
that guy hit Shelly.

962
01:38:18,970 --> 01:38:22,259
"Anyway, no good telling you."
You're not the sort who'd understand.

963
01:38:23,506 --> 01:38:25,627
You care not for your own honour
nor for that of others.

964
01:38:25,630 --> 01:38:31,667
"Go, get your shopping done."
Do something worthwhile for a change.

965
01:38:51,560 --> 01:38:56,350
What nonsense!
"There's a limit to everything,"

966
01:39:13,997 --> 01:39:16,993
"Why did you do this, Raj?"
"- It was right, bhabhi."

967
01:39:16,993 --> 01:39:20,243
She was making fun of traditions.
"- Not she, you made fun of it."

968
01:39:21,198 --> 01:39:23,904
"But bhabhi, she..."
"- She was observing the fast, too..."

969
01:39:23,904 --> 01:39:27,444
hungry and thirsty since morning.
And you flung her plate of worship?

970
01:39:28,068 --> 01:39:30,355
Married women observe these fasts
"for their husbands, bhabhi."

971
01:39:30,358 --> 01:39:33,560
"Yes. Also, women observe these fasts"
for the men they accept as husbands.

972
01:39:34,060 --> 01:39:36,225
Jiya asked me before
observing the fasts.

973
01:39:36,225 --> 01:39:39,055
"Bhabhi, you don't know this girl."
She has been after me for sometime now

974
01:39:39,055 --> 01:39:42,511
She's an eccentric.
"- Enough Raj, enough."

975
01:39:42,511 --> 01:39:46,381
We know everything.
She has told us everything.

976
01:39:47,837 --> 01:39:51,127
You lied to her
that you left for India.

977
01:39:51,127 --> 01:39:54,538
She traveled halfway around
the world only to see you.

978
01:39:55,497 --> 01:39:59,368
"She's not eccentric, Raj."
She loves you madly.

979
01:39:59,827 --> 01:40:02,073
"But brother, I..."
"- No buts, Raj."

980
01:40:02,073 --> 01:40:07,362
You promised to marry the girl
of my choice. Jiya is my choice.

981
01:40:08,444 --> 01:40:11,024
"No, this can't be."

982
01:40:11,024 --> 01:40:14,020
"Raj, why not?"

983
01:40:14,020 --> 01:40:17,269
I agree you didn't get the girl
you loved. But that doesn't mean...

984
01:40:17,725 --> 01:40:20,140
you should spurn other's love.

985
01:40:20,140 --> 01:40:23,926
What's wrong with Jiya?
She's madly in love with you.

986
01:40:23,926 --> 01:40:26,050
"Mummy, sister..."

987
01:40:26,051 --> 01:40:28,131
"I'm leaving, bhabhi."

988
01:40:28,131 --> 01:40:29,712
"Bye, brother."

989
01:40:29,712 --> 01:40:33,501
"No brother, I don't want this home"
to break up because of me.

990
01:40:34,500 --> 01:40:39,328
The few days I spent with you were
just great. I can never forget them.

991
01:40:41,118 --> 01:40:44,408
Please forgive me if I committed
any mistake unknowingly.

992
01:40:46,822 --> 01:40:50,278
I suppose I was trying to achieve
what wasn't destined for me.

993
01:40:52,359 --> 01:40:57,230
"Bye, bhabhi."

994
01:41:02,140 --> 01:41:04,761
"Your uncle is hopeless, my dear."

995
01:41:04,761 --> 01:41:07,091
There's lot of poison in his mind.
- Stop my sister.

996
01:41:07,094 --> 01:41:12,006
It is said that those with broken
hearts don't break others' hearts.

997
01:41:13,795 --> 01:41:19,210
That isn't true at all.

998
01:41:26,033 --> 01:41:30,112
"Raj, please don't tell me any such"
thing that I won't be able to bear.

999
01:41:30,113 --> 01:41:33,109
Stop.

1000
01:41:33,109 --> 01:41:38,564
Will you marry me?

1001
01:41:40,935 --> 01:41:45,095
Say yes or no.

1002
01:41:45,096 --> 01:41:50,926
"Here, drink some water"

1003
01:42:12,319 --> 01:42:15,483
"Love is an illusion, they say"

1004
01:42:16,314 --> 01:42:19,685
So I held my feelings back

1005
01:42:20,560 --> 01:42:24,059
"Love is an illusion, they say"

1006
01:42:24,640 --> 01:42:28,676
So I held my feelings back

1007
01:42:29,136 --> 01:42:32,631
I wanted the one whom I love
to love me

1008
01:42:33,216 --> 01:42:37,710
The thought of it rendered me
sleepless for nights together

1009
01:42:37,711 --> 01:42:44,122
Allah forbid!
May no one fall in love

1010
01:42:45,786 --> 01:42:52,362
Allah forbid!
May no one fall in love

1011
01:43:14,966 --> 01:43:18,127
He is naive and so innocent

1012
01:43:18,670 --> 01:43:22,292
My lover is different

1013
01:43:23,331 --> 01:43:25,203
He's indifferent now...

1014
01:43:25,203 --> 01:43:30,533
but I know my love will succeed

1015
01:43:35,609 --> 01:43:39,108
"I'm excited,"
an ecstasy overwhelms me

1016
01:43:39,649 --> 01:43:43,104
"Hold me,"
I'm staggering

1017
01:43:44,020 --> 01:43:47,181
How do I tell you?
Your touch...

1018
01:43:47,806 --> 01:43:51,761
spreads a fragrance all over me

1019
01:43:56,256 --> 01:43:59,627
"Love is a passing breeze, they say"

1020
01:44:00,252 --> 01:44:03,500
So I held my feelings back

1021
01:44:04,250 --> 01:44:07,828
"Love is a passing breeze, they say"

1022
01:44:08,412 --> 01:44:11,826
So I held my feelings back

1023
01:44:12,614 --> 01:44:16,154
I wanted the one whom I love
to love me

1024
01:44:16,737 --> 01:44:19,899
The thought of it rendered me
sleepless for nights together

1025
01:44:21,273 --> 01:44:28,890
Allah forbid!
May no one fall in love

1026
01:44:29,349 --> 01:44:36,216
Allah forbid!
May no one fall in love

1027
01:44:52,326 --> 01:44:55,863
"Amidst a lovely course,"
in your eyes...

1028
01:44:56,363 --> 01:44:59,944
I shall make my world
that I dream about

1029
01:45:00,609 --> 01:45:03,774
"Strings of love,"
few lovely moments...

1030
01:45:04,479 --> 01:45:08,225
I shall rob of life

1031
01:45:12,889 --> 01:45:16,219
"Adorn my hair,"
steal my fragrance...

1032
01:45:16,719 --> 01:45:20,381
"hide me in your embrace, my love"

1033
01:45:21,380 --> 01:45:24,792
"In the Eden of love,"
take me in your arms...

1034
01:45:25,251 --> 01:45:29,038
"make love to me, my love"

1035
01:45:33,368 --> 01:45:36,614
"In love, I was condemned"

1036
01:45:37,363 --> 01:45:40,612
So I held my feelings back

1037
01:45:41,527 --> 01:45:44,855
"In love, I was condemned"

1038
01:45:45,730 --> 01:45:49,269
So I held my feelings back

1039
01:45:50,144 --> 01:45:53,890
I wanted the one whom I love
to love me

1040
01:45:54,389 --> 01:45:59,009
The thought of it rendered me
sleepless for nights together

1041
01:45:59,010 --> 01:46:05,336
Allah forbid!
May no one fall in love

1042
01:46:23,984 --> 01:46:30,189
My Mummy is very traditional. She's
going to give you a religious welcome

1043
01:46:32,809 --> 01:46:36,011
Where is everyone?
"Ram Singh, what happened?"

1044
01:46:36,014 --> 01:46:41,470
"Madam, daughter-in-law..."
- What...?

1045
01:47:28,380 --> 01:47:30,960
"Mr. Singhaniya, this is the third time"
your daughter-in-law...

1046
01:47:30,960 --> 01:47:33,622
has tried to kill herself.
Had the nurse on duty...

1047
01:47:33,622 --> 01:47:36,953
"not seen her on time,"
we would've lost her this time.

1048
01:47:36,953 --> 01:47:40,488
What are you saying?
- I'm sorry Mr. Singhaniya...

1049
01:47:40,951 --> 01:47:45,194
"if things go on like this, we will"
have to send her to the mental asylum

1050
01:47:45,944 --> 01:47:49,189
Asylum?

1051
01:47:49,189 --> 01:47:52,229
For the moment we will keep her
"in the ICU, under observation."

1052
01:47:52,230 --> 01:47:55,725
Pray that she becomes well enough
to take care of herself...

1053
01:47:55,728 --> 01:47:59,557
and that she doesn't do this again.

1054
01:48:21,908 --> 01:48:27,362
"Kajal, your sister-in-law"
has been my friend since childhood.

1055
01:48:33,398 --> 01:48:39,853
Never even in my worst nightmares
did I foresee her in this condition.

1056
01:48:40,515 --> 01:48:45,006
I met Karan once.

1057
01:48:45,010 --> 01:48:49,005
"She loved him very much,"
madly.

1058
01:48:49,005 --> 01:48:53,417
"Yes, my brother loved her, too."
They made such a beautiful couple.

1059
01:48:54,667 --> 01:48:56,997
I guess someone's
cast an evil eye on them.

1060
01:48:57,000 --> 01:49:00,993
What had happened?
- Two months after their marriage...

1061
01:49:00,993 --> 01:49:04,326
Karan and Kajal were going
to our farmhouse in Rishikesh...

1062
01:49:05,988 --> 01:49:10,444
when their helicopter crashed
into River Ganges.

1063
01:49:12,399 --> 01:49:16,060
My brother died on the spot.
But sister-in-law survived...

1064
01:49:16,060 --> 01:49:19,268
only to live a life
worse than death.

1065
01:49:19,268 --> 01:49:23,970
She was in coma for four months.
When she came around...

1066
01:49:25,304 --> 01:49:28,422
and learnt that Karan was dead
she was petrified.

1067
01:49:29,256 --> 01:49:33,962
"Ever since, she has been like this."
All she wants to do is end her life.

1068
01:49:35,457 --> 01:49:39,372
She feels she is responsible
for my brother's death...

1069
01:49:40,037 --> 01:49:43,701
because it was she who forced him
to fly the helicopter in bad weather.

1070
01:49:45,529 --> 01:49:50,399
"We did try to explain things to her,"
but she's been inconsolable.

1071
01:49:54,108 --> 01:50:00,684
"She will listen, she will definitely"
"listen, now that I am here."

1072
01:50:01,600 --> 01:50:07,761
"And I promise you, I will"
bring her back to her senses.

1073
01:50:14,090 --> 01:50:19,751
"Bhabhi, look who is here to see you."

1074
01:50:39,105 --> 01:50:42,557
Is this any way to meet
your friends?

1075
01:50:42,559 --> 01:50:48,304
"No hi, no hello, no stupid."

1076
01:50:48,304 --> 01:50:52,047
"Hey come on, talk to me, buddy."

1077
01:50:54,380 --> 01:51:00,380
"Kajal, say something please."

1078
01:51:01,164 --> 01:51:07,246
Talk to me... come on.

1079
01:51:18,273 --> 01:51:22,810
"Why doesn't she talk, Jiya?"
She will die if she doesn't talk.

1080
01:51:24,725 --> 01:51:29,514
The pain has hardened her heart.
We must melt it somehow.

1081
01:51:31,344 --> 01:51:35,171
"Enough, I don't want more."
"- Monty, you are here?"

1082
01:51:35,171 --> 01:51:38,630
"Jiya, you've come all alone?"
Where's Raj?

1083
01:51:39,087 --> 01:51:41,289
He's in the hospital
"with Kajal, Mummy."

1084
01:51:41,289 --> 01:51:44,788
"With Kajal, why?"
"- Uncle, he's Kajal childhood friend."

1085
01:51:45,371 --> 01:51:48,617
Is that so?
And I thought he's your friend.

1086
01:51:48,618 --> 01:51:51,823
"Monty, he is my fiancé,"
and Kajal's friend.

1087
01:51:51,823 --> 01:51:55,277
"Oh yes, I remember him, singing"
and dancing at Karan's marriage.

1088
01:51:56,194 --> 01:51:58,817
You were in the US
preparing for your exams.

1089
01:51:58,817 --> 01:52:02,395
Karan introduced him to me
as Kajal's best friend.

1090
01:52:02,895 --> 01:52:06,765
Remember what you said to me once?

1091
01:52:06,765 --> 01:52:11,136
The world does not end
when a loved one goes away.

1092
01:52:13,636 --> 01:52:20,420
You also said that if somebody
uses that excuse to ruin his life...

1093
01:52:21,295 --> 01:52:25,750
he not only insults his love
but also the person he loves.

1094
01:52:29,286 --> 01:52:33,488
"Now here you are Kajal, doing"
"that very thing, insulting Karan."

1095
01:52:36,528 --> 01:52:38,274
Think.

1096
01:52:38,274 --> 01:52:42,189
"If Karan were around, would he be"
happy seeing you in such a state?

1097
01:53:01,255 --> 01:53:04,707
"Kajal, you wanted me"
to become a pilot.

1098
01:53:04,707 --> 01:53:08,787
I have become a pilot now.
Look at me.

1099
01:53:08,788 --> 01:53:12,743
Do you remember I had promised you
to fly you across the clouds?

1100
01:53:20,734 --> 01:53:25,185
"We'll take our plane up into the sky,"
where visibility is almost zero.

1101
01:53:31,180 --> 01:53:34,261
And we'll perform aerobatics.

1102
01:53:34,264 --> 01:53:40,594
"After the strapping,"
we'll speed up and climb higher.

1103
01:53:42,962 --> 01:53:45,707
"We'll slowly climb,"
"10,000 feet... 20,000..."

1104
01:53:45,710 --> 01:53:50,246
"30,000 and 40,000 feet!"
Then we'll plunge down!

1105
01:53:57,698 --> 01:54:00,734
"We plunge down,"
splitting the clouds...

1106
01:54:00,734 --> 01:54:07,192
as our hearts begin to race.

1107
01:54:12,096 --> 01:54:15,345
We leave the sky behind...

1108
01:54:15,346 --> 01:54:18,469
as the earth looms larger
and larger before us.

1109
01:54:18,469 --> 01:54:24,295
Our speed suddenly shoots up.
We try to control the lever...

1110
01:54:24,546 --> 01:54:30,002
but the machine
springs out of control.

1111
01:54:30,706 --> 01:54:34,661
Our plane is out of control and we
continue to plunge towards the earth.

1112
01:54:35,161 --> 01:54:40,573
"And in a flash,"
our plane hits the ground!

1113
01:54:40,654 --> 01:54:42,694
The plane shatters. Everything
comes to an abrupt end.

1114
01:54:42,694 --> 01:54:45,398
No Karan!
- Everything comes to an end.

1115
01:54:45,399 --> 01:54:48,810
No!
- Kajal! Control yourself.

1116
01:54:48,813 --> 01:54:52,390
"Listen to me, Kajal."
- My Karan will die.

1117
01:54:52,390 --> 01:54:54,721
"Kajal, listen to me!"
- Karan!

1118
01:54:54,721 --> 01:55:00,139
"Control yourself, Kajal."

1119
01:55:03,381 --> 01:55:08,796
"Kajal, be brave."

1120
01:55:13,371 --> 01:55:18,786
My Karan!

1121
01:55:33,434 --> 01:55:37,346
"Kajal, easy. Be brave."

1122
01:55:39,429 --> 01:55:45,756
"Let me cry, Raj. Until now"
I did not have a shoulder to cry on.

1123
01:55:46,297 --> 01:55:48,251
Enough.

1124
01:55:48,252 --> 01:55:51,872
"Why did you come, Raj?"
To save me?

1125
01:55:51,872 --> 01:55:56,948
But my life isn't that precious.

1126
01:55:56,953 --> 01:56:00,573
"To me, my friend's life"
means more.

1127
01:56:00,573 --> 01:56:06,027
Control yourself. Everything will
be all right. I'll take you out.

1128
01:56:16,434 --> 01:56:19,679
"So now, I assume, you will"
take care of yourself.

1129
01:56:20,429 --> 01:56:25,679
"You will, won't you?"

1130
01:56:26,172 --> 01:56:30,420
"You're a wise and clever girl, Kajal."

1131
01:56:30,420 --> 01:56:35,414
You know that those who die
never return.

1132
01:56:36,828 --> 01:56:40,492
"It's wiser to forget them,"
don't you agree?

1133
01:56:40,492 --> 01:56:44,487
We can't guard or check
"our memories, Raj."

1134
01:56:44,489 --> 01:56:47,984
"Tell me, were you able"
to forget me even once?

1135
01:57:07,673 --> 01:57:11,001
"Though physically, she's still weak,"
but she will pick up.

1136
01:57:11,001 --> 01:57:17,292
"By the way, she is not in her room."
She is in the garden down there.

1137
01:57:19,078 --> 01:57:23,492
For you.

1138
01:57:23,492 --> 01:57:26,779
You don't look good
on this chair at all.

1139
01:57:27,944 --> 01:57:30,649
"Do you remember our childhood days,"
when I needed braces to walk around?

1140
01:57:30,649 --> 01:57:35,103
"And you used to say, get up Raj,"
"come on, run for my sake."

1141
01:57:35,645 --> 01:57:40,978
And I ran so fast. Remember?

1142
01:57:41,471 --> 01:57:45,094
"Come on, I tell you, hold my hand."

1143
01:57:45,094 --> 01:57:51,260
You know I won't let you fall. 

1144
01:57:57,001 --> 01:58:00,121
How did you come to know about me?
Your brother must have told you.

1145
01:58:00,121 --> 01:58:04,617
No.
- Who then? 

1146
01:58:04,617 --> 01:58:09,487
Call it coincidence if you like.
I'd come to meet Jiya's parents.

1147
01:58:11,609 --> 01:58:15,605
"I'm going to marry Jiya, you know?"
- What...?

1148
01:58:15,608 --> 01:58:21,688
"Then what are you standing there for,"
stupid? Come into my arms.

1149
01:58:23,265 --> 01:58:26,760
You have really
"pleased me today, Raj."

1150
01:58:26,761 --> 01:58:30,716
"I'm very happy,"
our Jiya is very lucky.

1151
01:58:34,462 --> 01:58:39,082
"Hey Kiran, where are you?"
- Coming.

1152
01:58:39,082 --> 01:58:43,911
What's up?
- There's an excellent news for you.

1153
01:58:44,367 --> 01:58:49,697
Mr. Singhaniya called to say that soon
he will get Raj and Jiya engaged.

1154
01:58:50,154 --> 01:58:53,608
That's great news.

1155
01:58:53,608 --> 01:58:58,353
"Know what, Kiran? Jiya is"
our Kajal's sister-in-law.

1156
01:59:00,688 --> 01:59:07,554
How does such a big world
become so small sometimes?

1157
01:59:15,130 --> 01:59:18,457
What medicine are you giving her?
- She needs sleep badly.

1158
01:59:18,457 --> 01:59:20,372
"And without these pills,"
she doesn't sleep a wink.

1159
01:59:20,376 --> 01:59:22,662
Why won't she sleep?
She will now.

1160
01:59:22,663 --> 01:59:26,036
And she will sleep tight without
"these wretched pills, all right?"

1161
01:59:28,823 --> 01:59:32,237
"Come on, I will help you to sleep,"
"come on, get up."

1162
01:59:50,011 --> 01:59:54,760
Can't sleep?

1163
01:59:56,752 --> 02:00:00,664
"So you can't sleep, eh?"
Want me to sing a lullaby?

1164
02:00:00,667 --> 02:00:05,539
"Sing, Raj."

1165
02:00:15,694 --> 02:00:18,814
From the bottom of my heart...

1166
02:00:18,814 --> 02:00:22,144
I pray...

1167
02:00:22,145 --> 02:00:24,390
may I be kept awake...

1168
02:00:24,394 --> 02:00:28,261
while you be given sleep

1169
02:00:28,264 --> 02:00:31,635
May your lips smile forever

1170
02:00:31,636 --> 02:00:34,881
May God bless you with happiness

1171
02:00:34,885 --> 02:00:39,626
May not sorrows
ever touch you

1172
02:00:40,751 --> 02:00:45,953
What breaks and then joins again
brings music into one's life

1173
02:01:19,255 --> 02:01:22,832
"Do you see what I see, Jiya?"

1174
02:01:22,832 --> 02:01:26,082
"I see more than what you see, Monty."

1175
02:01:27,457 --> 02:01:32,117
"Well, you've probably heard the tale"
of the tortoise and the rabbit.

1176
02:01:34,242 --> 02:01:38,152
The tortoise wins only
when the rabbit goes to sleep.

1177
02:01:39,109 --> 02:01:42,233
"Of course, it'll do me good."

1178
02:01:42,770 --> 02:01:48,728
"Don't worry Monty,"
I won't go to sleep.

1179
02:01:50,765 --> 02:01:55,219
"Ms Beena, enough. Thank God,"
our child is better now.

1180
02:01:55,885 --> 02:01:58,841
"That's one thing to be happy for,"
and not sad.

1181
02:01:58,841 --> 02:02:02,420
"Yes Mr. Sahay, for our child's healing,"
we really owe God our gratitude.

1182
02:02:02,837 --> 02:02:05,082
We must also thank our
to-be son-in-law.

1183
02:02:05,082 --> 02:02:07,207
"Mr. Singhaniya, he may be"
a son-in-law to you...

1184
02:02:07,207 --> 02:02:09,621
"but to us, he has always been"
like our own son.

1185
02:02:09,621 --> 02:02:13,908
"Uncle, I think we should take"
Kajal somewhere out...

1186
02:02:14,533 --> 02:02:18,737
"to Dehradun, perhaps. The change of"
atmosphere may do her a world of good.

1187
02:02:19,819 --> 02:02:21,858
My word.

1188
02:02:21,858 --> 02:02:25,314
Since there's still some time left
before Jiya's engagement...

1189
02:02:25,314 --> 02:02:29,725
do allow us to take my daughter
"Kajal with me, for a few days."

1190
02:02:30,269 --> 02:02:33,846
But we need to consult the doctor.

1191
02:02:33,846 --> 02:02:38,510
The doctor himself suggested to Jiya
that we take her out somewhere.

1192
02:02:38,510 --> 02:02:41,170
"In that case, I don't have"
any objection.

1193
02:02:41,172 --> 02:02:46,042
"Thank you, Mr. Singhaniya."

1194
02:02:46,045 --> 02:02:47,914
Where's GI Joe?

1195
02:02:47,914 --> 02:02:51,371
"I have lost my sleep,"
my peace of mind

1196
02:02:51,828 --> 02:02:54,908
"In your love,"
look what's happened to me

1197
02:02:54,911 --> 02:02:58,154
What's happened?
- Shall I tell you?

1198
02:02:58,154 --> 02:03:01,444
"Last night, there was"
a lion's wedding in the jungle.

1199
02:03:01,444 --> 02:03:04,233
Lions and lionesses came from
everywhere to attend the party.

1200
02:03:04,233 --> 02:03:07,605
"There was a mouse too, and he was"
"lying in a corner, stoned."

1201
02:03:08,230 --> 02:03:12,807
A lion hollered at him and ordered him
to step out of the cozy corner.

1202
02:03:13,307 --> 02:03:15,679
"And the mouse replied,"
"Hey, quit shouting at me."

1203
02:03:15,679 --> 02:03:18,885
I was a lion once...
before I married.

1204
02:03:18,885 --> 02:03:22,880
"But GI Joe, tell me,"
why have you come so late?

1205
02:03:22,881 --> 02:03:26,251
"Yeah, why am I late?"
You won't believe me.

1206
02:03:26,957 --> 02:03:31,413
My wife locked me up inside. She
warned me with dire consequences...

1207
02:03:31,663 --> 02:03:34,036
if I attempted to step out
of the house for two hours.

1208
02:03:34,036 --> 02:03:37,283
Why?
- She said the municipality van...

1209
02:03:37,286 --> 02:03:40,987
had been roaming the town
to catch stray dogs.

1210
02:03:40,987 --> 02:03:43,942
You're laughing?
"Tell me, am I a dog?"

1211
02:03:43,944 --> 02:03:48,063
I learnt afterwards that she had
gone to the circus with Ramdas.

1212
02:03:48,064 --> 02:03:50,228
"Help me prepare my will, please."
- Talk something auspicious.

1213
02:03:50,229 --> 02:03:55,143
No good. One day I have to die.
Do promise me that after my death...

1214
02:03:55,599 --> 02:03:58,845
you'll get my wife married to Ramdas.

1215
02:03:59,261 --> 02:04:02,385
"But why Ramdas, and not someone else?"
- Because I want revenge.

1216
02:04:02,385 --> 02:04:05,546
"And the best revenge, they say, is"
to get one's foe married to his wife.

1217
02:04:06,002 --> 02:04:09,417
There's a world of difference
between a girlfriend and a wife.

1218
02:04:09,916 --> 02:04:14,203
When she locks him up for a couple
"of hours, then he'll realize! Ramdas!"

1219
02:04:14,953 --> 02:04:17,576
GI Joe...
- Yes?

1220
02:04:17,578 --> 02:04:21,864
"I know, you don't have a wife,"
neither is there a Ramdas.

1221
02:04:29,564 --> 02:04:31,935
GI Joe...

1222
02:04:31,935 --> 02:04:36,309
"Sir, all this while I've been making"
the whole world laugh with one lie...

1223
02:04:36,931 --> 02:04:41,011
that I have a wife. But today
I failed to amuse that child.

1224
02:04:44,135 --> 02:04:47,921
Unless I bring back happiness
into her life...

1225
02:04:49,002 --> 02:04:54,667
I'm no Girdhar Inder Jaunpurwala.

1226
02:06:04,185 --> 02:06:06,307
Fie on those lips that kill.

1227
02:06:06,307 --> 02:06:10,179
Death is a prize to be won Madhu.
Punishment is what...

1228
02:06:10,720 --> 02:06:14,298
"How does the line go, Sweety?"
"- What are you doing, Kamal?"

1229
02:06:14,300 --> 02:06:18,295
"When Raj used to say these lines,"
it used to rent our hearts. Remember?

1230
02:06:18,297 --> 02:06:22,000
If only Raj was with us today...
- Really? Here I am.

1231
02:06:25,206 --> 02:06:27,661
"Raj, you? How come you are here?"

1232
02:06:27,663 --> 02:06:31,240
You too tell her I called you over.
"- You did, of course."

1233
02:06:31,240 --> 02:06:35,196
"Raj, please do that last scene for us."
"- Now, I'm so tired."

1234
02:06:35,821 --> 02:06:42,066
Quit acting pricey.
"Kajal will have company, too."

1235
02:06:43,646 --> 02:06:47,432
"Wow, that's more like it."
"Come on, start. Action!"

1236
02:06:47,432 --> 02:06:51,762
"O Angel of Love, how can"
I forget such a noble sacrifice?

1237
02:06:52,762 --> 02:06:57,506
Sacrifice? I don't know.
It's a huge honour...

1238
02:06:58,298 --> 02:07:01,919
to be kissed by lips
"as silken as these, before one dies."

1239
02:07:03,332 --> 02:07:05,706
Fie on those lips
that kill.

1240
02:07:05,707 --> 02:07:08,618
"Death is a prize to be coveted, Madhu."

1241
02:07:08,618 --> 02:07:13,240
It would have been a punishment
if I'd been condemned to live...

1242
02:07:14,362 --> 02:07:20,362
and live far away from
these sweet lips.

1243
02:07:20,564 --> 02:07:23,356
I can't hold back anymore.

1244
02:07:23,356 --> 02:07:29,432
I can't.
- These lines are out of the script.

1245
02:07:29,433 --> 02:07:35,052
"Death comes but once,"
so does life.

1246
02:07:36,800 --> 02:07:40,421
"So, why are we ruining our lives?"

1247
02:07:40,421 --> 02:07:44,415
Why are we living separately?

1248
02:07:44,419 --> 02:07:48,414
Why are we tormenting each other?

1249
02:07:48,415 --> 02:07:51,868
I can't live without you.

1250
02:07:51,868 --> 02:07:56,576
"I can't, Kajal."

1251
02:07:58,445 --> 02:08:01,856
"I love you very much, Kajal."

1252
02:08:01,860 --> 02:08:07,064
I love you dearly.

1253
02:08:25,503 --> 02:08:29,665
Lord! Love is what...

1254
02:08:31,414 --> 02:08:35,700
none can avoid

1255
02:08:38,487 --> 02:08:43,776
"In love, some ruin others..."

1256
02:08:46,356 --> 02:08:50,767
some ruin themselves

1257
02:08:52,017 --> 02:08:55,636
"Love, love" 

1258
02:08:55,636 --> 02:08:59,385
"I reasoned with myself,"
but to no good

1259
02:08:59,927 --> 02:09:03,380
"I reasoned again,"
but to no good

1260
02:09:03,921 --> 02:09:07,957
"Let none covet bed of roses,"
or bed of thorns

1261
02:09:08,499 --> 02:09:12,373
Let none lose his peace

1262
02:09:12,870 --> 02:09:16,740
Lord! May no one fall in love

1263
02:09:17,325 --> 02:09:20,406
Lord! May no one fall in love

1264
02:10:00,865 --> 02:10:04,861
Putting love to test is hard

1265
02:10:05,445 --> 02:10:08,774
Love is a promise hard to keep

1266
02:10:09,315 --> 02:10:13,060
The world is against love

1267
02:10:13,601 --> 02:10:17,596
It gets tougher on you
when you fall in love

1268
02:10:18,431 --> 02:10:22,260
Why don't lovers come
to terms with it?

1269
02:10:27,173 --> 02:10:30,253
Why do they weep everyone moment
in torment?

1270
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:34,457
Lord! May no one fall in love.

1271
02:10:35,080 --> 02:10:38,825
Lord! May no one fall in love

1272
02:11:06,507 --> 02:11:09,878
At times love finds itself
bound by customs

1273
02:11:10,464 --> 02:11:14,168
At times it finds itself
caught in promises

1274
02:11:15,123 --> 02:11:18,536
"Yet, none can stop it"

1275
02:11:19,120 --> 02:11:22,534
Love takes on every sorrow"

1276
02:11:23,575 --> 02:11:27,154
Love belittles you in public

1277
02:11:27,695 --> 02:11:31,524
Love belittles you in public

1278
02:11:32,024 --> 02:11:35,479
May no one weave this dream

1279
02:11:36,310 --> 02:11:39,517
Lord! May no one fall in love

1280
02:11:45,178 --> 02:11:50,467
Lord

1281
02:11:58,705 --> 02:12:02,659
"Love, love"

1282
02:12:02,659 --> 02:12:06,072
No force can rein in love

1283
02:12:06,738 --> 02:12:10,568
Love is a season that never passes

1284
02:12:11,649 --> 02:12:15,022
It's passion.
You have to give in

1285
02:12:15,688 --> 02:12:19,185
You can't hold back

1286
02:12:24,096 --> 02:12:28,592
"Don't ask me, it's pure ecstasy"

1287
02:12:30,632 --> 02:12:33,919
where fire sates flower

1288
02:12:35,128 --> 02:12:38,580
Lord! May no one fall in love

1289
02:12:43,700 --> 02:12:47,615
"I reasoned with myself,"
but to no good

1290
02:12:48,115 --> 02:12:51,777
"I reasoned again,"
but to no good

1291
02:12:52,277 --> 02:12:56,231
"Let none covet bed of roses,"
or bed of thorns

1292
02:12:56,688 --> 02:13:00,601
Let none lose his peace

1293
02:13:01,226 --> 02:13:04,596
Lord! May no one fall in love

1294
02:14:10,740 --> 02:14:12,904
Kajal... stop.

1295
02:14:12,904 --> 02:14:15,986
How long will you avoid the truth?
- Your vision has changed.

1296
02:14:16,524 --> 02:14:18,770
Your outlook has changed.
You're crossing your limits.

1297
02:14:18,773 --> 02:14:22,351
"This is a sin, Raj."
"- No sin, Kajal. It's love."

1298
02:14:23,518 --> 02:14:26,682
"I love you dearly, Kajal,"
and I wish to marry you.

1299
02:14:27,389 --> 02:14:29,803
"Stop it, Raj."

1300
02:14:29,803 --> 02:14:32,798
You don't care about my honour?

1301
02:14:32,802 --> 02:14:35,505
How dare you utter things
that are impossible?

1302
02:14:35,505 --> 02:14:39,375
"Why is it impossible Kajal, why?"
- Because I'm the daughter-in-law...

1303
02:14:39,794 --> 02:14:44,706
of the Singhaniya family.
I shall not bring them to disrepute.

1304
02:14:47,534 --> 02:14:51,159
"So far, I felt they lost"
their son because of me.

1305
02:14:53,489 --> 02:14:56,524
Do you want me to ruin their
daughter's life too?

1306
02:14:57,193 --> 02:15:00,731
"Kajal, I'm talking about my life."
"- Raj, you are being selfish."

1307
02:15:02,813 --> 02:15:05,683
But get this clear.

1308
02:15:05,686 --> 02:15:11,888
"If you refuse to marry Jiya,"
you'll see me dead. Remember.

1309
02:15:16,133 --> 02:15:19,837
Jiya...

1310
02:15:19,837 --> 02:15:22,169
When did you come?
- Why? Shouldn't I come?

1311
02:15:22,169 --> 02:15:24,207
I didn't mean that. Kajal
and I were just talking about you...

1312
02:15:24,207 --> 02:15:26,827
Only four days to go
for our engagement.

1313
02:15:26,827 --> 02:15:29,869
So I thought I'd come and take
sister-in-law along with me.

1314
02:15:29,870 --> 02:15:32,279
"When I phoned Nainital,"
"they told me you were here, too."

1315
02:15:32,279 --> 02:15:37,274
"And when I reached here, I was told"
a big drama was being staged.

1316
02:15:37,274 --> 02:15:39,356
I didn't do anything wrong
"by coming here, did I?"

1317
02:15:39,360 --> 02:15:42,106
"No, you did the"
"right thing, my sister."

1318
02:15:42,106 --> 02:15:46,187
You've come at the right moment.
"- But bhabhi, your hands are so cold."

1319
02:15:46,645 --> 02:15:49,933
"Are you all right? If you say so,"
I'll even postpone my engagement.

1320
02:15:50,932 --> 02:15:55,092
No. The engagement will go on
as planned.

1321
02:15:55,677 --> 02:16:01,965
And it'll be grand.
"Let's go, Jiya."

1322
02:16:06,957 --> 02:16:11,159
Kajal's state rents my heart.

1323
02:16:12,951 --> 02:16:17,821
But none of us can help it.
There's no solution for sadness.

1324
02:16:19,236 --> 02:16:22,816
"There is, uncle. If you don't mind,"
may I suggest something?

1325
02:16:23,398 --> 02:16:26,812
"Yes, go on."
- Why don't you get her married again?

1326
02:16:27,895 --> 02:16:31,971
"What are you saying, dear?"

1327
02:16:31,971 --> 02:16:35,846
Our society is yet to recognize
a widow's remarriage.

1328
02:16:37,592 --> 02:16:43,879
"Besides, it's hard to find"
a match for a widow.

1329
02:16:44,625 --> 02:16:48,664
Leave that to me. I'll find a boy
from a very good family.

1330
02:16:49,914 --> 02:16:52,908
"Tell me, do you have any objections?"
- But...

1331
02:16:52,908 --> 02:16:56,865
"Dear, if it's happiness you're"
going to bring our daughter...

1332
02:16:57,904 --> 02:17:02,986
why would we object?
- All right. Leave the rest to me.

1333
02:17:04,024 --> 02:17:07,186
"In fact, I already have"
a suitable boy for her in mind.

1334
02:17:09,976 --> 02:17:13,432
Hi Jiya. How come
"you remembered me, suddenly?"

1335
02:17:13,432 --> 02:17:16,471
"Monty, you told me once your wedding"
"suit has been stitched, remember?"

1336
02:17:16,971 --> 02:17:19,842
"Yes, of course."
- It's time to get it dry-cleaned.

1337
02:17:19,842 --> 02:17:23,293
You're going to be wearing it soon.
- Really? Is that true?

1338
02:17:23,297 --> 02:17:29,248
Don't get too excited.
Just do as I told you.

1339
02:17:29,248 --> 02:17:33,664
Bhabhi...d

1340
02:17:35,158 --> 02:17:38,364
How does this wedding dress look?

1341
02:17:38,364 --> 02:17:42,904
"Very beautiful, just like our Jiya."
- You talk so sweetly.

1342
02:17:43,611 --> 02:17:47,438
Sweet words come to me
at the very sight of you.

1343
02:17:47,438 --> 02:17:51,895
"Same here. Anyway, wear this sari"
and get ready quickly.

1344
02:17:52,476 --> 02:17:56,052
What are you saying?
Are you out of your mind?

1345
02:17:56,057 --> 02:17:59,927
"I'm a widow, Jiya."
How can I wear a bridal dress?

1346
02:18:00,967 --> 02:18:05,048
Which century do you live in?
That practice is dated now.

1347
02:18:05,673 --> 02:18:08,918
Whatever. Our society will
never allow this.

1348
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:13,288
Are you concerned about
my happiness or society's?

1349
02:18:13,289 --> 02:18:15,783
I'd do anything for
"your happiness, Jiya."

1350
02:18:15,788 --> 02:18:18,947
"All right then, you will"
definitely wear this sari.

1351
02:18:18,947 --> 02:18:22,529
"And what's more, it's from your hands"
that I shall accept my engagement ring

1352
02:18:23,029 --> 02:18:27,274
No! Don't force me.
- Not a word shall I hear.

1353
02:18:28,024 --> 02:18:32,270
Wear this sari and get ready quickly.
Or I shall simply refuse to marry.

1354
02:18:33,020 --> 02:18:38,433
"You know me well, bhabhi."

1355
02:19:20,388 --> 02:19:23,717
What evil times we live in!
- Isn't she ashamed?

1356
02:19:26,717 --> 02:19:30,085
Good Lord! It's apocalypse!
"- It's true, aunt."

1357
02:19:30,086 --> 02:19:33,789
Look how she is decked up.

1358
02:19:33,789 --> 02:19:36,870
No one cares for good and evil
these days!

1359
02:19:36,870 --> 02:19:40,072
"That's Karan's widow, isn't she?"
- What's her name?

1360
02:19:40,076 --> 02:19:42,822
"Kajal. And yes, she is the one."

1361
02:19:42,822 --> 02:19:45,445
What was it you were saying?
Tell me frankly.

1362
02:19:45,447 --> 02:19:48,486
"My child, it's not right for her"
to adorn herself like this.

1363
02:19:49,110 --> 02:19:52,855
It hasn't been that long
since her husband died.

1364
02:19:52,855 --> 02:19:56,685
You're right. But didn't
your son die last year?

1365
02:19:57,268 --> 02:20:01,514
"Kavita, you lost your sister."
"And Mrs. Khanna, you lost your father."

1366
02:20:02,138 --> 02:20:06,388
But you've all dressed up to the do.
- The rules for a widow are different

1367
02:20:07,507 --> 02:20:09,879
That's our culture.

1368
02:20:09,880 --> 02:20:13,880
Rules? Dual standards! If you lose
"a father, son, or brother..."

1369
02:20:17,123 --> 02:20:20,495
you don't grieve. But if you lose
a husband you should wear white.

1370
02:20:21,077 --> 02:20:25,489
"Why? I ask, why are these rules"
"only for women, and not for men?"

1371
02:20:26,154 --> 02:20:29,899
Why don't widowers
wear white dresses?

1372
02:20:29,899 --> 02:20:33,145
Great are the traditions of my
country. If that's how things are...

1373
02:20:33,148 --> 02:20:37,436
Kajal will soon cease to be a widow.
We'll get her married again.

1374
02:20:40,558 --> 02:20:43,802
"Monty, come with me."

1375
02:20:43,802 --> 02:20:47,217
Put the engagements rings
on each other.

1376
02:20:47,217 --> 02:20:50,423
"What are you doing, Jiya?"
You and Raj are going to be engaged.

1377
02:20:50,423 --> 02:20:53,586
"Sure, but first the elder daughter"
"should be engaged, right Papa?"

1378
02:20:54,254 --> 02:20:59,120
"Of course. Kajal, we consider you"
"our daughter, not a daughter-in-law."

1379
02:20:59,952 --> 02:21:03,077
And we took a decision
in the best of your interests.

1380
02:21:03,619 --> 02:21:07,197
"Yes my child, you have"
a whole life ahead of you.

1381
02:21:07,197 --> 02:21:10,529
And we're thankful to Mr. Singhaniya
for his noble thought.

1382
02:21:10,986 --> 02:21:16,645
What are you saying? Did anyone
ask me if I'm willing to marry?

1383
02:21:17,188 --> 02:21:20,101
"Bhabhi, does Monty lack something?"
- Jiya!

1384
02:21:20,101 --> 02:21:23,096
Or are you in love with someone else?
- What nonsense!

1385
02:21:23,096 --> 02:21:29,596
It's the truth!
"You're in love with my fiancé, Raj."

1386
02:21:31,757 --> 02:21:33,629
"Enough Jiya, please!"
"- It's true, Kajal."

1387
02:21:33,630 --> 02:21:37,042
May I ask you what right you had
to threaten Raj with suicide...

1388
02:21:37,043 --> 02:21:41,120
"if he didn't marry me? Tell me,"
why did Raj agree to marry me?

1389
02:21:43,245 --> 02:21:45,572
"I know everything,"
I've heard everything.

1390
02:21:45,576 --> 02:21:48,947
It isn't acceptable to me that he
weds me and continues to love you.

1391
02:21:49,572 --> 02:21:52,942
"Stop it, Jaya!"
There's nothing of the sort.

1392
02:21:52,943 --> 02:21:56,230
"Look, if you wish, I'm ready"
for this marriage.

1393
02:21:56,230 --> 02:22:02,645
"Monty, come on,"
put the ring on my finger.

1394
02:22:11,218 --> 02:22:15,923
Stop!

1395
02:22:17,336 --> 02:22:20,248
"Come to your senses, Kajal."
You can't ruin your life...

1396
02:22:20,250 --> 02:22:23,327
for somebody else's happiness.
- Why? Why?

1397
02:22:23,327 --> 02:22:26,827
Does marrying again ruin one's life?
Why are you stopping her from marrying?

1398
02:22:27,326 --> 02:22:30,654
What does she mean to you? What
relationship do you share with her?

1399
02:22:30,654 --> 02:22:36,654
Do you want a wife and a mistress
together...?

1400
02:22:37,191 --> 02:22:43,190
Do you wish to know what
she means to me? Do you?

1401
02:23:25,727 --> 02:23:29,304
That's what she means to me.
She is my wife.

1402
02:23:29,306 --> 02:23:33,468
Any objections?

1403
02:23:33,468 --> 02:23:37,297
"Want to say something, aunt?"

1404
02:23:37,298 --> 02:23:40,335
Tell me!
- Raj....

1405
02:23:40,336 --> 02:23:43,414
it's just what I wanted. 

1406
02:23:43,414 --> 02:23:46,992
I staged this mock engagement
with Monty...

1407
02:23:46,996 --> 02:23:50,576
so that you would openly declare
your love for her.

1408
02:23:53,449 --> 02:23:56,904
"Not a burden, I want"
to become your wings...

1409
02:23:57,443 --> 02:24:03,442
"so that you can fly high,"
very high.

1410
02:24:03,685 --> 02:24:08,346
Jiya...

1411
02:24:08,347 --> 02:24:12,760
"you're grown up, really."

1412
02:24:12,760 --> 02:24:16,093
"I was mistaken about you, really."

1413
02:24:18,632 --> 02:24:22,000
"I ought to apologize to you, Raj."

1414
02:24:22,001 --> 02:24:26,664
"Though involuntarily,"
I have hurt Kajal no end.

1415
02:24:28,414 --> 02:24:33,827
"Forgive me, Kajal."

1416
02:24:41,855 --> 02:24:45,184
These traps of traditions...g

1417
02:24:45,185 --> 02:24:48,391
these shackles of promises...t

1418
02:24:48,393 --> 02:24:53,016
I could never break
even if I wish to

1419
02:24:54,760 --> 02:24:57,882
What kind of helplessness is this?

1420
02:24:57,884 --> 02:25:01,336
What kind of a life is this?

1421
02:25:01,336 --> 02:25:05,915
I could never break free
from old ties

1422
02:25:07,208 --> 02:25:12,327
"This is what life is all about,"
it is said

1423
02:25:16,154 --> 02:25:18,568
If you love someone...

1424
02:25:18,568 --> 02:25:21,525
express it...

1425
02:25:21,527 --> 02:25:26,770
before it is too late

1426
02:25:27,435 --> 02:25:30,391
If you trust someone...

1427
02:25:30,393 --> 02:25:33,011
say it... 

1428
02:25:33,015 --> 02:25:38,385
before it is too late.

1429
02:25:39,798 --> 02:25:44,711
That's the secret to steal hearts.
