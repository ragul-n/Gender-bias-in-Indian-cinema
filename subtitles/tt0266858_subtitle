You Tube search name - Pocket Maar

3
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:21,940
- What's he done?
- Picked someone's pocket.

4
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:25,330
- What's your name?
- Mukhiram Bairagi.

5
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,180
Frisk him.

6
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:07,920
Oh Goddess Tulsi...

7
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:12,430
please do save us

8
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:17,040
Oh Goddess Tulsi

9
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:21,490
Whenever there's been a problem...

10
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:25,330
you were always there to save us

11
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:31,140
Granny! Granny, please save me.

12
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,940
Mother's beating me.

13
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:36,240
Why Malti? Why are you beating him?

14
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,060
What's he done today?

15
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:40,640
Today he's again stolen
sweets from the sweet shop.

16
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:43,010
I'm tired of this habit of his.

17
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,370
Everyone keep saying
that when he grows up...

18
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:48,720
he'll become a thief, dacoit,
and many other things.

19
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,440
Those people are mad
who speak like this.

20
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,540
Children are very mischievous.

21
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:56,240
My Roshan was no less mischievous.

22
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:59,306
Whoever used to see him would say...

23
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:01,030
he'd become a thief, dacoit or loafer.

24
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,230
But today when you see my son...

25
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,890
he's become a good and honest person.

26
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:12,070
People who used to call him
thief and robber, now...

27
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,520
they give him respect
and praise him.

28
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,780
They keep saying they've never...

29
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,590
seen such an honest man
as him before.

30
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:57,970
Wow, it's a very beautiful necklace.
Your choice is excellent.

31
00:05:58,510 --> 00:05:59,910
It's one in thousands.

32
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:03,690
Do you like it? Then let's buy it.

33
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:05,490
Give it here, sir.

34
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:59,480
Thief, thief. Police catch him,
thief, police, catch him.

35
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:01,791
- What happened?
- Constable, he stole my wife's necklace.

36
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:04,600
A thief took it away.

37
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:07,110
Catch him.

38
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:09,690
Catch him.

39
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:11,650
Who are you, my friend?

40
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:17,120
At least show me your face.

41
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:24,530
Let the friendship of darkness
remain in the darkness.

42
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:02,890
So, is it all set inside?

43
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:04,870
Yes, everything's set.

44
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,650
And whenever I saw the world
it was also set accordingly.

45
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:09,840
And even the person
who goes to jail gets set up.

46
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:13,050
Leave me alone.
Listen to me. Let me go.

47
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:19,640
I've only borrowed money,
not killed anyone

48
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:22,540
For the sake of humanity
may you all go to hell.

49
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,720
Good day!

50
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,126
I'm saying that some time,
some how it becomes...

51
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:36,280
a problem when you cheat on a loan.

52
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,810
Sometimes? Have you lost your mind?

53
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:43,176
Here, everyday and everything
is on loan.

54
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,660
Ration loan, clothes loan, tea
and water loans, tobacco...

55
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:48,200
and cigarette loans.

56
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:54,706
That's why my parents have
suitably named me Udharchand Dabbo.

57
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:56,330
There's no doubt about your parents.

58
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,440
I can understand Udaharchand.

59
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:00,610
But can't understand
this name Dabbo?

60
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:03,550
You seem to be a man
from the old generation.

61
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:45,486
Here take. What is this sir?
Every day you come 15 minutes early?

62
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:46,910
Friend, that's my job.

63
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:50,190
Wow, you've got really
a nice set here.

64
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,740
Color.

65
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,350
Roshan? Say friend,
how are you today?

66
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:01,820
Oh! Even I feel like gambling today.

67
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:04,180
Then play my friend,
as life is a gamble.

68
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:06,390
Then give me hundred rupees.

69
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:11,600
Hundred rupees? Your pocket
seems to be full today.

70
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:14,140
A very big treasury
has come into my hand.

71
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:16,710
- Oh, is that so?
- So, give me.

72
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,320
Take friend, for you
money is nothing.

73
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:22,650
If there's treasure,
I'll even give my life.

74
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,820
Take this. It's five rupees less.

75
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,560
For the interest.

76
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:30,450
Deal cards for me, too.

77
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:31,850
Sit, sit.

78
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:45,980
What, friend? Come on.

79
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:53,380
I'm out.

80
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:57,940
That's all, 10 rupee blind.

81
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,740
10 blind!

82
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,530
Here take from me, too.
10 and 10, 20 blind.

83
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:12,070
- I'm out too.
- You saw that friend? Even he's out.

84
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,730
- So, 100 rupees game?
- Yes, a hundred rupee game.

85
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,960
Here, take, hundred rupee
game from my side.

86
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:32,570
Ah! No my friend, if you want to play,
then put in your money first.

87
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,800
Otherwise you might
mix your cards with the pack.

88
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:40,320
Money? I'll give you
money my friend.

89
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,380
- Grandmaster?
- Coming friend.

90
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,396
So, what's the matter?

91
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:49,370
- I'm stuck.
- Then why don't you play?

92
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:51,830
Give me another 100 rupees.

93
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:53,470
Another100 rupees?

94
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:56,050
First show me the treasure
you've hidden in your pocket.

95
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:59,010
Is it even worth 200 rupees
or are you just bluffing?

96
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:01,490
- It's worth a thousand rupees, sir.
- Really?

97
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,120
- Wait. I'll show you now.
- Very good, very good!

98
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:13,940
Shake hands sir, today somebody
else has picked my wallet.

99
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,900
Somebody picked your pocket?

100
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:21,030
But don't worry.
This 100 rupees is a loan on me.

101
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,720
I'll return it to you by tomorrow.

102
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,920
You seem to be very fast?

103
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,020
So Ustad, what's your plan.

104
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:39,830
Leave your watch here.
Then my plans are good or else.

105
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:41,580
Or else you'll
remove my watch forcefully?

106
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:43,130
Something like that, my friend.

107
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:46,340
Sir, what's the use of force
between honest men?

108
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,620
Here, take it.

109
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,720
Take him and throw him out.

110
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:48,090
Hello there.

111
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:55,130
I said, sometimes by gambling on loans,
you may get into trouble.

112
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,230
What happened sir? You always
had money in your pocket but...

113
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:02,240
today I learned that
even you also borrow money.

114
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,836
What you're saying
is true my friend, but...

115
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,260
when I went inside...

116
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,460
I went in thinking
I have thousands of rupees.

117
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:12,190
Even I went inside thinking...

118
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:15,890
I'd come out with thousands.

119
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:21,170
But we both know with what
respect we were thrown out.

120
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:26,180
Come friend, you must be cold.
Let's go have a cup of tea.

121
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,480
Come on.

122
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:29,290
We're friends now.

123
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:31,750
But remember this cap is on loan.

124
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:35,700
At the corner we'll get masala tea.

125
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:38,970
Police? Don't worry.
I'll tell them.

126
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:43,870
Inspector sir, we both were
listening to a story.

127
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:46,480
We heard a man say that gambling
is going on in that house.

128
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:48,090
- Where?
- In that house.

129
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:49,710
Come on, let's be quick.

130
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,920
Come, come.

131
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,840
It feels very nice drinking tea.

132
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:01,510
After getting kicked,
hot tea serves like penicillin.

133
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,040
What did you say, pencil?

134
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,840
Not pencil, penicillin, penicillin.

135
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,860
- Medicine!
- Yes, medicine

136
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:11,950
Yes, after getting kicked,
only medicine works.

137
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:15,230
What work do you do?

138
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,520
I don't work. I just enjoy myself.

139
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,650
I eat from the money
earned by this hand.

140
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,380
The whole world's hand
on one side...

141
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,500
and my right hand on the other side.

142
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,560
What can I say about this hand?

143
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:41,500
Why have you become quiet sir?
This thunder will keep going.

144
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,210
This is the monsoon season.

145
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:45,720
Drink tea and have fun.

146
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:50,570
Dabbo, Dabbo.

147
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:52,430
Dabbo.

148
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:55,770
Friend, for the first time
some girl has called me.

149
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:57,190
I'm coming.

150
00:16:58,620 --> 00:16:59,720
Dabbo.

151
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:02,230
Hello darling, come on.
Where did you go?

152
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:07,770
Naughty boy, come on.
Where did you go?

153
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:11,810
Yes, tell me, why did you call me?

154
00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:13,729
- Who are you?
- Me?

155
00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:16,626
The one you lovingly call Dabbo.

156
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:18,050
That's my dog's name.

157
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:20,456
What did you say?
It's your dog's name?

158
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,065
You women have a bad habit.

159
00:17:22,089 --> 00:17:26,315
Just to insult men, you name
your dogs similar to their name.

160
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:27,839
- Shut up.
- You shut up.

161
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:31,850
Excuse me, madam, if we have
a cat and if we name...

162
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:34,210
her Vimla, Kamla, Flora or Dolly...

163
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:35,790
then how will you feel?

164
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:38,130
- How will I feel?
- Like this.

165
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:40,040
Come on darling, come on.

166
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:45,660
Two eyes met each other

167
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,000
Two eyes met each other
and love blossomed

168
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:54,060
One hand on the face,
and it felt like a massage

169
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,450
It felt like a massage

170
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:33,950
See how sir's fair cheeks
have turned red

171
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:44,570
The man was left to sit alone

172
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,340
The vessel was burned
but the curry didn't burn

173
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:49,890
The man was left to sit alone

174
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:52,880
The slap hit you very hard

175
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:58,150
And received a nice treat

176
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:02,260
One hand on the face,
and it felt like a massage

177
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,840
It felt like a massage

178
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:08,890
Two eyes met each other
and love blossomed

179
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:13,030
One hand on the face,
and it felt like a massage

180
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,750
It felt like a massage

181
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:42,550
A cracker burst in such a way
that it made a loud noise

182
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:53,830
People have said the truth,
that love leads to fights

183
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,220
Even the richest who have fallen in love...

184
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:07,480
Even the richest who have fallen
in love, had to pay dearly

185
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:11,640
One hand on the face,
and it felt like a massage

186
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:14,270
It felt like a massage

187
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,220
Two eyes met each other
and love blossomed

188
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:22,340
One hand on the face,
and it felt like a massage

189
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,200
It felt like a massage

190
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:52,270
You don't know me
yet I am your guest

191
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:57,480
Oh dear ones,
the game of love is not so easy

192
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,710
To keep falling in
love the world has...

193
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:16,990
To keep falling in love,
the world has made it. It's a habit

194
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:21,240
One hand on the face,
and it felt like a massage

195
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,650
It felt like a massage

196
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:27,820
Two eyes met each other
and love blossomed

197
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:32,020
One hand on the face,
and it felt like a massage

198
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,570
It was like a massage

199
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,650
Two eyes met each other
and love blossomed

200
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:42,850
One hand on the face,
and it felt like a massage

201
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:45,170
It felt like a massage

202
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:49,350
Two eyes met each other
and love blossomed

203
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:53,460
One hand on the face,
and it felt like a massage

204
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:56,320
It felt like a massage

205
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:13,930
- Son?
- Yes.

206
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:16,260
Why do you come so late every day?

207
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:18,970
Is your office open the whole night?

208
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:24,100
Mom, our business is very
different from others.

209
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,700
We don't know when can catch a prey.

210
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:30,060
Do you work to catch a prey?

211
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:32,360
Oh! Mother, you don't understand.

212
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,990
We only call the customer prey.

213
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,940
It's difficult for a shop keeper
to get a customer.

214
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:41,380
In the same way it's difficult
for us to get a prey.

215
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,300
It's the same thing.
Just give some dal.

216
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:49,110
Roshan, in your childhood you
were very mischievous.

217
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:53,050
People fed up with your mischief
would say...

218
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:58,230
"When he grows up he'll become
a rogue." What a world.

219
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,980
The world is very odd mother.
Give me some dal.

220
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:24,760
Hands up! If you want to stay alive
then put your hands up.

221
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:27,870
Whatever you have in your pocket,
give it to me.

222
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:31,030
There's nothing in my pockets.

223
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:33,470
Okay, give me what you
have in your hand.

224
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:35,606
My hands have my life lines, friend.

225
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:38,540
Keep that for yourself.
Give me this watch.

226
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,870
- Watch?
- Yes, fast.

227
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,740
Or else I'll use force.

228
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:45,150
I'm an honest man.
Why use force?

229
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,140
Take it yourself.

230
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:49,990
You really are an honest man.

231
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,100
I'm dead!

232
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:59,850
I'm destroyed!

233
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:02,230
Early morning you
started beating me.

234
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,476
You, Dabbo?

235
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,830
Friends call me Udharchand Dabbo.

236
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,570
What's this new business of yours?

237
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:08,530
What can I do, friend?

238
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,580
Since morning I've been wanting
a cup of tea.

239
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:14,000
I got that, but this work is dangerous,
you know?

240
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:17,100
Yes I know that. I tried to rob you
because I know you're my friend.

241
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:20,430
Even if the knife really
hurt you in the stomach...

242
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:24,760
you wouldn't call the police.
You'd just die.

243
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:30,590
I'll tell you something.
Just think how much I trust your honesty.

244
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:32,750
- Can I tell you something?
- Yes.

245
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:36,350
I'm an honest man. You're an honest man.

246
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,196
So why don't you help me?

247
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,720
- Help? - Yes.
- What help?

248
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:42,260
You don't understand anything.

249
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,900
At least tell me.

250
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:47,900
Nothing much. Teach me your business.

251
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,330
These days nobody in the city gives loans.

252
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:54,760
Because of your little generosity,
my life will be made.

253
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:57,500
Okay, friend, you'll also remember me.

254
00:24:58,090 --> 00:24:59,890
Do you have any money
in your pocket?

255
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:01,870
What are you saying?

256
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:04,630
If I had money, why would
I allow you to beat me?

257
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,600
Wouldn't I go to a hotel and eat?

258
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,520
That's true.

259
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:12,790
Roshan, it's the woman
who slapped us.

260
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,720
Just see with what pride she's standing.

261
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:22,710
Last night she slapped us.

262
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:24,790
I'll just teach her a lesson.

263
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,900
A very hard one, okay?

264
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:34,480
God, send this woman to hell.

265
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:38,040
First she slapped my face.
Now she's damaged my hand.

266
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:40,570
Friend, she hits very hard,
even from the photo.

267
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:48,480
Every night in hotel Paris
along with food...

268
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,080
is Ms. Rita's dance.

269
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:53,270
Life is very short, live happily

270
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:57,820
Forget the world. What have
you got to with the world?

271
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:02,340
Why be sad?
Drink the juice of happiness

272
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:07,100
Forget the world. What have
you to do with the world?

273
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:11,610
Life is short, live happily

274
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:38,440
You lead the way
and let the world follow you

275
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:51,520
On seeing you, if the
world is jealous...

276
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:58,350
On seeing you, if the world is
jealous, then let it be jealous

277
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:03,100
Of what benefit is the friendship
with the world for you?

278
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:07,550
Forget the world. What have you
to do with the world?

279
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:12,140
Life is short.
Live it your own way

280
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:16,510
Forget the world. What have
you to do with the world?

281
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:21,150
Life is short.
Live it your own way

282
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:44,110
Whether morning or evening,
you should be concerned only with fun

283
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:57,490
Why should the lovers
also be somebody's slave?

284
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,280
Somebody's slave

285
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:06,580
This is how life is

286
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:09,030
If you want to live it,
live it like this

287
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:13,350
Forget the world. What have
you to do with the world?

288
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:17,880
Life is short.
Live it your own way

289
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:22,600
Forget the world. What have
you to do with the world?

290
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:27,100
Life is short.
Live it your own way

291
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,380
I'm sorry for forcing you.

292
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,320
This settles the score.

293
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:08,816
Thief, thief, thief.

294
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,780
Thief, thief, thief.

295
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:54,340
You rogue.

296
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:06,470
The friendship of darkness
has come out in the light.

297
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:08,680
Once I saved you from the police...

298
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:10,780
now from a death sentence.

299
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:13,230
Thank you.

300
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,070
You took your first favor back
by taking the necklace...

301
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,000
but I'll fulfill your second favor.

302
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:41,640
From your talk, I felt as if you
were searching for a man like me.

303
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,810
- Yes.
- And when you saw me...

304
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:46,570
you thought this was the jewel...

305
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:48,406
for whom you've been waiting
all these years.

306
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:49,730
Yes, absolutely correct.

307
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:52,550
Absolutely correct.

308
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:57,580
So Shaikh sir, how much
will you give for this jewel?

309
00:31:57,950 --> 00:31:59,450
A thousand rupees per month.

310
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,016
A thousand rupees a month?

311
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:03,400
Not enough? Then I'll increase
it by Rs 200. Okay, Rs 1,200.

312
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:08,620
- How much money do you have in your pocket now?
- Do you want an advance?

313
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,280
No advance.

314
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:14,820
Listen, if you don't who I am...

315
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,260
and I pass by you...

316
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:20,760
then this two thousand rupees
of yours will be in my pocket

317
00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:26,090
Now tell me, if I earn
two thousand rupees in a minute...

318
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:28,310
how much will it be in 30 days?

319
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,530
But you'll be getting
a salary every month.

320
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,080
- What's the use of such money?
Sir, whatever happens...

321
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,610
I'm an independent person.

322
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:36,390
I can't work for anyone.

323
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,650
When necessary, I do business.
Otherwise I rest.

324
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:43,260
It's my principle never to get greedy.

325
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:44,790
Earn less, be happy.

326
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:47,140
- Good bye.
- But listen.

327
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:52,820
I'll listen later. Take this cigarette.

328
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,060
Our score is settled now.

329
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:08,890
You know how
to settle scores very nicely.

330
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:12,130
If we're not even,
then do tell me.

331
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,680
If it's another meeting you want,
then you're being coy.

332
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,020
Rita, I need this man.

333
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,500
Only you?

334
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:45,120
Ignoring someone's wish

335
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:49,520
Don't go away you innocent man

336
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:52,850
This opportunity
doesn't come every day

337
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:02,750
Stranger, it's not often that the mood
is so harmonious

338
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:07,190
This opportunity
doesn't come every day

339
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:39,390
The moth approaches the fire

340
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:43,800
Where is the loved one going?

341
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:02,840
The heart gets disturbed
in this manner

342
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:07,170
Try to understand the situation
created by time

343
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:11,910
This opportunity
doesn't come every day

344
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:20,500
lgnoring someone's wish

345
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:24,970
Don't go away you innocent man

346
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:29,730
This opportunity
doesn't come every day

347
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:57,160
It's not the same
thing every time

348
00:35:57,450 --> 00:36:01,710
Not everyone is so beautiful

349
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:20,730
The clouds cannot be depended on

350
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:24,890
As it does not rain every time

351
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:33,840
This opportunity is a guest
for only two days

352
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:38,380
There won't be the cuckoo's
voice tomorrow

353
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:42,650
This opportunity
doesn't come every day

354
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:51,690
lgnoring someone's wish

355
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:56,090
Don't go away you innocent man

356
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:00,470
This opportunity
doesn't come every day

357
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:27,810
- Daboo!
- Who is it? Oh! Roshan.

358
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:36,040
Wow! My friend, show me please?

359
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:40,940
It's really heavy.
Is it made of iron?

360
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:42,910
Its made of gold, real gold.

361
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,280
- Real gold?
- Where are you going?

362
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,700
To sell it.

363
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,340
Even I can sell it.

364
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:51,410
I don't understand this person.

365
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:54,490
I tried to give him money.
He didn't listen.

366
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:58,500
You tried to lure him with your
beauty, but he still escaped.

367
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:00,970
He's a very strange man.

368
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:05,000
He's not a strange person,
but a marvelous man.

369
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:08,490
But also a very stubborn person.

370
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,380
One minute. Have you finished the work
for which I sent you?

371
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:16,810
Sir, please come over here.

372
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:31,370
You may leave now.

373
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:40,070
Why? What happened?

374
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:42,260
All the hard work is wasted.

375
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:51,770
Come let's go.

376
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,220
What's all this?

377
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,800
What happened?

378
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,276
Three notes are missing.

379
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,600
What's written here?

380
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:55,350
'I'm taking your three thousand
rupees. I'm helpless.'

381
00:39:56,650 --> 00:39:58,370
'It depends on you
whether you think this...

382
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:00,820
is robbery or helplessness.'

383
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:02,910
'I promise I'll try to return...

384
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:05,250
your money when I can. Mohan.'

385
00:40:06,290 --> 00:40:07,500
- Mohan.
- Who?

386
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:10,350
- The one you recently hired for the job?
- Yes.

387
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:38,790
- Roshan! Roshan!
- What is it?

388
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,990
Friend, I have news for you.

389
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:46,430
One man has three thousand rupees

390
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:48,470
- Where?
- Over there.

391
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:52,040
I feel as if you're some
news agency's agent.

392
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,100
The same agency where
you're the president.

393
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:55,466
Me, a president?

394
00:40:55,490 --> 00:40:57,410
He is the agent
for the pickpockets' news agency.

395
00:40:57,690 --> 00:41:00,460
- Oh! I thought it was the sewage and the sewage company.
- Come.

396
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,540
Give a money order form.

397
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:30,000
Hey friend, come on,
stand in line.

398
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:31,990
Yes, stand in the queue.

399
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,840
Hey fat man, does this queue
belong to your father?

400
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:37,270
Hey! Your father must be fat.

401
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:40,190
I asked you politely,
but you're insulting me.

402
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:41,850
Come, stand in the queue.

403
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:45,840
I won't stand in the queue.
Give me a form.

404
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,910
Hey, wait in line.

405
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:51,050
Why are you just watching?
Throw him out.

406
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:59,200
Yes, yes, let's throw him.
Beat him, beat him.

407
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:16,660
My envelope, my envelope?
My envelope...

408
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:18,880
has three thousand in it. My envelope?

409
00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:23,320
Roshan, there's no one here.

410
00:42:23,530 --> 00:42:25,130
Nobody is watching. Open the envelope.

411
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:26,720
Open the envelope and look

412
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:29,770
Yes, there's something in here.

413
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,356
They're thousand rupee notes.

414
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:38,080
One, two, three thousand rupees.

415
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,726
Thank you very much, God.

416
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:43,250
What's this, praying to money?

417
00:42:43,370 --> 00:42:46,430
Friend, these days, I can
see God in these notes.

418
00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:48,870
Give it to me, give me, give me.

419
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:52,570
- Roshan, can I tell you something?
- Yes.

420
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:55,200
Now our life will be
very comfortable.

421
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,206
You keep talking about comfort.
Let me see where this man...

422
00:42:58,230 --> 00:43:00,010
has sent so much money.

423
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:06,840
Greetings, mother.
Do you remember the day...

424
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,920
when Ladoo Shah insulted you
in front of ten people?

425
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:14,420
And he said that if
you don't repay the loan...

426
00:43:14,890 --> 00:43:16,590
then he'd auction your house?

427
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:23,080
That day, to earn the money,
I came to Bombay.

428
00:43:23,490 --> 00:43:25,386
I was lucky.
As soon as I reached Bombay...

429
00:43:25,410 --> 00:43:27,560
I met a noble person
who gave me a nice job.

430
00:43:28,090 --> 00:43:30,870
Yesterday I told him of our problem...

431
00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:35,140
of the unpaid loan and losing your home.

432
00:43:35,830 --> 00:43:38,590
And where would you go
in such a big world?

433
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:40,880
And you'd have to wander
place to place.

434
00:43:40,970 --> 00:43:43,146
A soon as he heard this,
he took three thousand rupees...

435
00:43:43,170 --> 00:43:44,780
and placed them before me, mother.

436
00:43:44,850 --> 00:43:46,346
I'm sending it to you.

437
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:47,970
Take this money to Ladoo Shah...

438
00:43:48,010 --> 00:43:49,970
and get back the papers for the house.

439
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:51,680
Your son, Mohan.

440
00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:24,050
Wow! My God, you are really amazing.

441
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:28,060
When you give something,
you give whole heartedly.

442
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:32,140
These hands have never touched
one 100 Rupee note...

443
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:35,006
and today I'm holding
3 notes of thousand rupees.

444
00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:36,426
Give me that money.

445
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:38,480
Wait, let me see first.

446
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:42,530
Roshan, where are you going?

447
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:45,610
Where are you going
Where are you going, friend?

448
00:44:46,090 --> 00:44:50,960
- To return the money where it belongs.
Don't make this mistake.

449
00:44:56,030 --> 00:44:59,800
Roshan, it seems as if
a robbery has taken place.

450
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:03,130
Not robbery, a poor boy
has committed suicide.

451
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:04,710
- Suicide?
- Yes.

452
00:45:04,750 --> 00:45:06,780
- Who?
- Mohan. - Mohan?

453
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,176
What was his character like?

454
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,800
He was a very good person.

455
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:17,340
From the time he first came here...

456
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:19,520
he was always busy
with some work or other.

457
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:22,040
He appeared to be very sad.

458
00:45:22,710 --> 00:45:25,890
Tired of his sadness,
he must have committed suicide.

459
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:34,190
Roshan, Roshan.

460
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:41,880
Roshan, listen.

461
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:45,580
- Where are you going?
- To Mohan's village.

462
00:45:45,950 --> 00:45:47,350
To Mohan's village, why?

463
00:45:47,990 --> 00:45:49,590
To give his mother the money.

464
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:07,670
Forgive me, I'm unknown to you.

465
00:46:07,730 --> 00:46:09,326
But I'd like to speak to you.

466
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:11,800
Why? Am I not that capable that...

467
00:46:11,830 --> 00:46:13,870
you can't talk to me,
even if I'm unknown to you?

468
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:15,816
Say, what do you want to say?

469
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:17,440
How far is Madhaopur from here?

470
00:46:17,770 --> 00:46:19,790
Madhaopur, six kilometer.

471
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:22,050
Are taxis available?

472
00:46:22,450 --> 00:46:23,550
Taxi!

473
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:27,496
Listen gentleman,
in the third five-year plan...

474
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:30,180
from here to Madhaopur,
our taxis will go.

475
00:46:30,490 --> 00:46:32,090
Can you wait that long?

476
00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:34,400
You're a strange man.

477
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:37,840
You want a taxi. It's not possible,
not possible, not possible.

478
00:46:38,070 --> 00:46:40,350
It's possible, absolutely possible.

479
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:44,940
Come here sir, this vehicle
will start In a little while.

480
00:46:46,990 --> 00:46:49,030
Don't be afraid. When needed,
even donkeys have...

481
00:46:49,450 --> 00:46:50,870
to behave like horses.

482
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:53,820
Before evening you'll reach Madhaopur.

483
00:46:53,970 --> 00:46:55,570
I also stay in the village.

484
00:46:56,890 --> 00:46:59,310
Hey uncle, do you want to stay,
or come along?

485
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:02,940
Does your aunt stay here
and is going to make food for me here?

486
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:06,720
You'll get aunty in your next birth.

487
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,790
Sir, don't be offended.

488
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:12,060
All the girls in the village
call me uncle.

489
00:47:13,050 --> 00:47:14,860
Come on sir.
Sit on the donkey.

490
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:17,880
- It's time to go.
- I'll walk with you.

491
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:20,810
As you wish, come on.

492
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:05,900
Take, have some water.

493
00:48:06,270 --> 00:48:07,770
And wash your face too.

494
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:09,970
Have some water too, sir.

495
00:48:10,790 --> 00:48:12,390
No thank you. I'm not thirsty.

496
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:15,490
You're a strange man.
You were just saying you were thirsty.

497
00:48:16,530 --> 00:48:18,960
Don't worry sir.
Nothing will happen to you.

498
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:22,990
Here, animals and humans
drink the same water.

499
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,400
Drink, drink some water.

500
00:48:25,770 --> 00:48:28,740
Take sir. There's a lot of water.

501
00:49:11,390 --> 00:49:15,866
To quench the thirst
of the thirsty eyes

502
00:49:15,890 --> 00:49:19,930
You are an innocent traveler

503
00:49:46,770 --> 00:49:51,090
I have come from the fields

504
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:03,980
I have selected
the best crops and come

505
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:09,000
My face is beautiful.
My eyes are sharp

506
00:50:15,010 --> 00:50:19,200
Show your spirit once

507
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:23,470
You are an innocent traveler

508
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:27,890
To quench the thirst
of the thirsty eyes

509
00:50:28,110 --> 00:50:32,380
You are an innocent traveler

510
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:58,550
I am the queen of rains

511
00:51:07,490 --> 00:51:11,790
I don't know the story
of a thirsty heart

512
00:51:16,230 --> 00:51:21,040
Come on to the clouds
with your desires

513
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:31,466
Sing some happy song

514
00:51:31,490 --> 00:51:35,530
You are an innocent traveler

515
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:40,150
To quench the thirst
of the thirsty eyes

516
00:51:40,250 --> 00:51:44,310
You are an innocent traveler

517
00:52:01,930 --> 00:52:06,010
I am one of the waves
of the river

518
00:52:14,990 --> 00:52:19,340
I have the best place of all

519
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:27,730
I am one of the waves
of the river

520
00:52:27,990 --> 00:52:30,090
I am the heart of the waves

521
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:32,700
My color is fair

522
00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:43,230
Take your eyes off my face

523
00:52:43,270 --> 00:52:47,290
You are an innocent traveler

524
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:51,890
To quench the thirst
of the thirsty eyes

525
00:52:51,970 --> 00:52:56,120
You are an innocent traveler

526
00:53:36,390 --> 00:53:39,860
Wow God, you give things
on a wide scale.

527
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:42,900
When you give, you give
whole heartedly.

528
00:53:43,270 --> 00:53:45,240
You have quenched my thirst completely.

529
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:46,800
Dabbo.

530
00:53:47,330 --> 00:53:49,376
Brother Dabbo, brother Dabbo,
that woman is calling you.

531
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:51,820
She's not calling me.
She's calling her dog.

532
00:53:51,950 --> 00:53:54,440
- Dabbo.
- No, friend, she's calling you.

533
00:53:54,660 --> 00:53:59,180
Her dog is angry and she's calling him.
Understand? Now do your work.

534
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:01,400
Dabbo, Dabbo.

535
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:05,080
No friend, I swear to God,
she's calling you.

536
00:54:05,190 --> 00:54:08,890
I swear to God,
once I thought the same.

537
00:54:09,130 --> 00:54:12,180
But after getting slapped
I learned that...

538
00:54:12,350 --> 00:54:14,930
she's calling out to her dog.

539
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:18,610
Understand? Now work quickly.

540
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:21,550
Dabbo, this time I'm
not calling my dog.

541
00:54:21,850 --> 00:54:23,730
- I'm really calling you.
- Madam...

542
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:26,280
if you want to remain friends with me...

543
00:54:26,510 --> 00:54:29,970
then either change the dog's name
or my name.

544
00:54:30,250 --> 00:54:32,980
So that you don't have a
problem in calling me.

545
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:35,220
If that's the problem,
then we'll surely change it.

546
00:54:35,310 --> 00:54:37,050
Will you play marbles?

547
00:54:37,090 --> 00:54:39,260
No I won't play marbles,
but tell me something.

548
00:54:39,450 --> 00:54:42,000
Why are you alone today?
Where's your friend?

549
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:45,170
Not my friend, call him
a sentimental fool.

550
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:46,770
He's gone to hell.

551
00:54:46,910 --> 00:54:49,250
I'm dying here of hunger
and he's gone to return...

552
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:50,896
three thousand rupees at a village.

553
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:52,116
Three thousand?

554
00:54:52,140 --> 00:54:53,540
Yes, a sentimental thief.

555
00:54:53,810 --> 00:54:55,770
- He's gone to Mohan's village.
- Mohan's village?

556
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:57,880
Why, are you also from
the same village?

557
00:55:04,270 --> 00:55:06,670
Why are you taking revenge
so early in the morning?

558
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:08,770
Beware, if you threaten
us like this again...

559
00:55:08,890 --> 00:55:10,310
I'll bring the police.

560
00:55:10,790 --> 00:55:13,486
- Are you a moneylender or a butcher?
- Yes, I'm a butcher.

561
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:16,340
Then what are you doing here?
Go to the city and work for a butcher.

562
00:55:16,390 --> 00:55:18,950
Tell that old women
to give me my 3,000 rupees.

563
00:55:19,010 --> 00:55:21,690
Then what's a meat market?
I'll even go the cemetery.

564
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:23,280
Now you're talking sense.

565
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:26,186
Die soon. Then we'll put
the money on your grave.

566
00:55:26,210 --> 00:55:28,320
Not me. The old lady
will go her grave.

567
00:55:28,630 --> 00:55:30,230
Who do you think I am?

568
00:55:30,530 --> 00:55:32,600
I'll get the police tomorrow morning.

569
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:35,140
I'll take each and everything
from this house.

570
00:55:35,250 --> 00:55:38,090
Listen Ladoo Shah, I'm explaining
it to you in simple terms.

571
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:40,410
Today there are celebrations
in this house...

572
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:42,580
and you're standing here
shouting your lungs out.

573
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:46,086
Remember, if I get angry I'll
slap you so hard...

574
00:55:46,110 --> 00:55:48,230
your name will change from
Ladoo Shah to Kachori Shah.

575
00:55:48,330 --> 00:55:50,430
Kachori is a very big thing.

576
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:53,410
Even if you make me Rabri Shah,
I'll still bring the police here.

577
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:58,500
Cool down Ladoo Shah.
You have a family.

578
00:55:58,930 --> 00:56:00,730
Don't you feel pity
for this old lady?

579
00:56:00,980 --> 00:56:03,800
This is the only house
where she can stay.

580
00:56:04,190 --> 00:56:06,230
Go, go away.
I'll even touch your feet.

581
00:56:06,970 --> 00:56:09,290
Surely you can touch my feet,
I'm like your father.

582
00:56:12,010 --> 00:56:13,790
What are you doing?

583
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:19,000
You've put mud on me.

584
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:21,930
I hope you're never happy.

585
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:26,200
These girls, I will
see each one of them.

586
00:56:40,340 --> 00:56:41,736
Is this Mohan's house?

587
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:44,350
- Yes, yes, I'm his mother.
- Who are you, son?

588
00:56:45,350 --> 00:56:49,880
I, I'm Mohan's friend, mother.

589
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:51,660
Have you come from Bombay?

590
00:56:51,890 --> 00:56:54,840
Yes, I was going to my
village from Bombay...

591
00:56:55,330 --> 00:56:57,026
and thought I'd inquire about you all.

592
00:56:57,050 --> 00:56:58,550
Very nice of you son.

593
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:00,156
How is my Mohan?

594
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:01,850
Today we're celebrating on his name.

595
00:57:02,060 --> 00:57:04,120
And he's sitting in Bombay.
Why didn't he come?

596
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:07,620
He has to go on a long trip, mother.

597
00:57:08,070 --> 00:57:11,920
Long trip, does he
have to travel also?

598
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:16,156
It's his last one.

599
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:20,120
Then it's fine. He must be having
a lot of problems in traveling.

600
00:57:20,350 --> 00:57:23,490
Never mind son.
I forgot to invite you inside.

601
00:57:23,630 --> 00:57:25,026
- Come inside.
- But mother...

602
00:57:25,050 --> 00:57:29,030
Come in son, sit down.

603
00:57:31,710 --> 00:57:33,310
Just as Mohan is for me...

604
00:57:33,530 --> 00:57:35,130
so is his friend to me.

605
00:57:35,250 --> 00:57:36,850
Consider this as your own house.

606
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:38,780
You're here at a very good time, son.

607
00:57:38,860 --> 00:57:40,770
Today my Mohan
has taken a new birth.

608
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:44,560
- New birth?
- Yes.

609
00:57:44,950 --> 00:57:47,850
Not only Mohan, the whole
family has had a new birth.

610
00:57:48,350 --> 00:57:50,880
Today our past ancestors would
have lost their name.

611
00:57:53,820 --> 00:57:55,216
I don't understand, mother.

612
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:56,840
I'll explain everything to you son.

613
00:57:56,980 --> 00:57:58,276
First, eat something.

614
00:57:58,300 --> 00:57:59,800
I'll get something for you.

615
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:04,560
Wow sir, you're also very strange.

616
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:09,240
Why didn't you tell me
you're my brother's friend?

617
00:58:10,210 --> 00:58:11,770
Was Mohan your brother?

618
00:58:12,770 --> 00:58:14,790
Not was, he is.

619
00:58:15,430 --> 00:58:17,660
Don't say 'was' again.
I'll feel bad.

620
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:20,690
I hope my brother
reaches my age too.

621
00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:26,340
Do you know today my brother
has escaped death?

622
00:58:28,130 --> 00:58:29,430
You didn't understand?

623
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:31,160
Come on, I'll explain it to you.

624
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:34,230
Listen, for the past 100 years...

625
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:36,420
this has been on going in our family.

626
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:40,740
Any boy born in our family would
die before the age of 25.

627
00:58:41,850 --> 00:58:45,000
Our great grandfather, grandfather
both died by the age of 24.

628
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:48,650
My father also died
at the age of 24.

629
00:58:49,710 --> 00:58:53,390
Just think, 4 days of
living a married life.

630
00:58:53,820 --> 00:58:55,540
Sisters getting angry
and making them happy.

631
00:58:55,930 --> 00:58:59,070
And then again those long nights.

632
00:59:00,130 --> 00:59:02,510
Sir, women would become
helpless by crying.

633
00:59:02,860 --> 00:59:05,760
And then they used to pray to
the goddess in the temple.

634
00:59:06,430 --> 00:59:10,420
Oh Goddess, if any man passes
the age of 25 then...

635
00:59:10,930 --> 00:59:12,720
we'll donate food in your temple.

636
00:59:13,190 --> 00:59:14,910
We'll give food for
the entire village.

637
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:18,110
Sir, today is that special day.

638
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:22,140
Today the goddess has listened to a
mother's prayers and a sister's wishes.

639
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:24,276
My brother has passed
the age of 25.

640
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:26,100
I hope my brother reaches my age too.

641
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:28,720
Sir, you don't know how
happy I am today.

642
00:59:29,220 --> 00:59:31,730
This evening I'll dance and sing.

643
00:59:33,150 --> 00:59:34,650
You'll also come right, sir?

644
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:37,760
Why have you become so sad?

645
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:41,370
Sir, listen.

646
00:59:44,340 --> 00:59:45,440
Sir.

647
00:59:47,170 --> 00:59:48,610
- Mother.
- What happened?

648
00:59:48,970 --> 00:59:50,270
- He's gone.
- Why?

649
00:59:50,630 --> 00:59:52,420
I don't know.

650
00:59:52,660 --> 00:59:54,510
I thought maybe
he couldn't bear our happiness.

651
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:56,540
And can't see our happiness.

652
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:58,020
He's Mohan's friend.

653
00:59:58,140 --> 01:00:00,200
- You must have told him something.
- Who, me?

654
01:00:01,650 --> 01:00:03,116
Watch how tomorrow morning...

655
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:04,736
I take the police warrant there.

656
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:07,360
The whole village will be shocked.

657
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:09,466
Today the way Mohan's
mother is showing her...

658
01:00:09,490 --> 01:00:11,486
happiness to the whole world
by giving food...

659
01:00:11,510 --> 01:00:13,896
tomorrow she's going to suffer
for even a small morsel of food.

660
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:15,850
Nobody survives when I bite them.

661
01:00:15,990 --> 01:00:18,610
What do they call them, a snake?

662
01:00:19,050 --> 01:00:21,950
Your father made a mistake.

663
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:24,930
He should have made
your name Nagraj.

664
01:00:26,940 --> 01:00:29,210
Why are you embarrassing me,
Barfi's mother?

665
01:00:29,410 --> 01:00:30,906
A name should be sweet.

666
01:00:30,930 --> 01:00:34,330
Like a Ladoo, which keeps
the poison hidden on the inside.

667
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:39,000
Now you do something.
Drink cold water and go to sleep.

668
01:00:39,210 --> 01:00:43,110
I'm going to the city to submit
these papers to the lawyer.

669
01:00:43,410 --> 01:00:47,786
And I'll tell him, "Sir, the papers
should be ready by morning".

670
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:49,310
- Ladoo Shah.
- Who is it?

671
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:51,060
That moment will not come.

672
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:55,540
Here are your 3,000 rupees.
Now give me those papers.

673
01:00:56,450 --> 01:00:58,520
3,000, give it here.

674
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:05,920
Three notes of thousand each.

675
01:01:06,380 --> 01:01:08,780
Today I have seen which lucky face.

676
01:01:08,890 --> 01:01:10,750
Have I seen my own face?

677
01:01:11,430 --> 01:01:14,650
Sir, but who are you? And why give me
this money so early in the morning?

678
01:01:15,020 --> 01:01:16,320
I'm Mohan's friend.

679
01:01:17,020 --> 01:01:18,516
It's a very good thing.

680
01:01:18,540 --> 01:01:20,316
You may be his friend or enemy.

681
01:01:20,340 --> 01:01:21,936
My only interest is the money.

682
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:23,560
Do you want something to drink?

683
01:01:38,750 --> 01:01:39,950
Hey sir.

684
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,710
That was our house. Not one
of your hotels from Bombay.

685
01:01:50,170 --> 01:01:52,370
You came in with a lot of pride,
sat under the fan...

686
01:01:52,550 --> 01:01:55,410
had a look at the paper
and took off.

687
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:58,450
Nobody even asked if you had
come from an orphanage.

688
01:01:59,410 --> 01:02:02,360
Do you know mother started
shouting at me?

689
01:02:02,620 --> 01:02:04,220
That I must have said something.

690
01:02:04,410 --> 01:02:06,210
Tell me, what did I say to you?

691
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:09,660
Did I abuse you, slap you?
I must have said something.

692
01:02:10,180 --> 01:02:12,960
Or else you wouldn't
have left like that.

693
01:02:13,460 --> 01:02:14,560
Speak.

694
01:02:15,110 --> 01:02:16,910
Ask for forgiveness for me
from your mother.

695
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:19,800
Why should I ask for forgiveness?
Am I your lawyer?

696
01:02:21,220 --> 01:02:24,670
Until you eat your
share of sweets...

697
01:02:25,060 --> 01:02:27,170
neither mother nor I
will forgive you.

698
01:02:27,970 --> 01:02:29,170
Have some.

699
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:34,520
Don't eat so much.

700
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:36,360
Your stomach will burst.

701
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:39,400
Give me your hand. Hold this.

702
01:02:39,820 --> 01:02:41,220
And open your mouth.

703
01:02:42,330 --> 01:02:43,430
Open.

704
01:02:48,650 --> 01:02:49,850
Take this.

705
01:02:59,420 --> 01:03:03,210
Between him and uncle Manglu's
donkey there's no difference.

706
01:03:04,790 --> 01:03:06,190
No, there's little difference.

707
01:03:09,100 --> 01:03:10,400
Both are stubborn.

708
01:03:46,470 --> 01:03:50,340
Innocent beloved, bring me a carriage

709
01:03:50,530 --> 01:03:54,990
Without you I get very bored

710
01:04:03,410 --> 01:04:06,830
lnnocent beloved...

711
01:04:28,250 --> 01:04:32,390
I am tired of filling water

712
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:40,510
Obeying all your orders,
all your orders

713
01:04:44,850 --> 01:04:48,640
lnnocent beloved, bring me a carriage

714
01:04:48,970 --> 01:04:53,356
Without you I get very bored

715
01:04:53,380 --> 01:04:57,050
lnnocent beloved...

716
01:05:10,090 --> 01:05:14,330
All day long I am cooking food

717
01:05:22,550 --> 01:05:26,480
With my fair hands
I have to sweep the floor

718
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:37,460
Better than doing all this work
would be if I die.

719
01:05:41,530 --> 01:05:45,030
I should die, I should die

720
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:49,200
lnnocent beloved, bring me a carriage

721
01:05:49,490 --> 01:05:53,886
Without you I get very bored

722
01:05:53,910 --> 01:05:57,340
lnnocent beloved...

723
01:06:22,940 --> 01:06:27,310
From the moment he married me...

724
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:51,480
he hasn't even taken me to a movie

725
01:06:51,710 --> 01:06:53,616
Not taken me to a movie

726
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:55,996
Nor has he given me
any lemonade to drink

727
01:06:56,020 --> 01:06:59,580
lnnocent beloved, bring me a carriage

728
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:03,520
Without you I get very bored

729
01:07:04,180 --> 01:07:07,550
lnnocent beloved...

730
01:07:23,580 --> 01:07:25,790
Stop this!
Stop this dance and music.

731
01:07:27,420 --> 01:07:29,390
All this is a lie, a lie.

732
01:07:32,790 --> 01:07:33,990
Good morning.

733
01:07:37,250 --> 01:07:39,700
Good morning, congratulations!

734
01:07:41,580 --> 01:07:43,546
Mother, today give Ladoo Shah
so many sweets...

735
01:07:43,570 --> 01:07:45,270
that it's enough for the whole week.

736
01:07:45,450 --> 01:07:47,500
If you don't eat sweets
at the time of happiness...

737
01:07:47,710 --> 01:07:49,310
then what should you eat?

738
01:07:49,950 --> 01:07:52,520
You said you'd call the police
to have us vacate the house.

739
01:07:52,980 --> 01:07:54,780
How have you changed
all of a sudden?

740
01:07:54,830 --> 01:07:56,980
Mother, I haven't changed
from my own wish.

741
01:07:57,010 --> 01:07:59,110
Those 3,000 rupees have
changed me. Ask me how?

742
01:07:59,350 --> 01:08:00,450
How?

743
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:03,290
That man who is Mohan's friend,
who has come from the city?

744
01:08:03,330 --> 01:08:04,830
He repaid all your loans.

745
01:08:06,010 --> 01:08:08,116
- All the money?
- I hope you're not lying.

746
01:08:08,140 --> 01:08:09,810
Why should I lie?

747
01:08:09,950 --> 01:08:12,030
Those who lie,
don't sleep well at night.

748
01:08:12,790 --> 01:08:15,500
Here, take your papers
and give me some sweets.

749
01:08:17,630 --> 01:08:18,730
Hey.

750
01:08:20,090 --> 01:08:21,460
Hey, hey.

751
01:08:30,069 --> 01:08:31,779
So mister, are you someone in disguise?

752
01:08:32,710 --> 01:08:34,750
From the station to here
you've taken so many roles?

753
01:08:35,779 --> 01:08:38,469
Why don't you say who you are
and what's the truth?

754
01:08:39,229 --> 01:08:40,929
I told you I'm your brother's friend.

755
01:08:41,810 --> 01:08:43,210
I already know that.

756
01:08:43,670 --> 01:08:45,840
- What about the 3,000 rupees?
- It's nothing.

757
01:08:46,830 --> 01:08:48,910
To keep one's friendship
people give their lives too.

758
01:08:50,660 --> 01:08:53,920
Listen mister, you perplex me.

759
01:08:55,290 --> 01:08:58,160
Listen, look at me.

760
01:08:59,189 --> 01:09:05,029
See, if I don't understand
someone's actions, I get very stressed.

761
01:09:06,149 --> 01:09:09,449
On the one hand you say
you can give your life for my brother.

762
01:09:10,140 --> 01:09:12,800
I agree because you
have repaid our loan.

763
01:09:13,939 --> 01:09:17,289
On the other hand, when we're
celebrating for our brother...

764
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:18,936
you stop us.

765
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:22,070
You scream loudly and say,
"Stop all this. This is all a lie."

766
01:09:23,319 --> 01:09:25,499
Thank you. I made a mistake.

767
01:09:26,910 --> 01:09:28,110
Forgive me.

768
01:09:28,609 --> 01:09:30,209
Let the sorry go to hell.

769
01:09:30,260 --> 01:09:31,860
First tell me, what's the matter?

770
01:09:32,620 --> 01:09:34,590
Why did you say
our happiness was false?

771
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:45,040
Is there something you know...

772
01:09:46,050 --> 01:09:47,420
and aren't telling?

773
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:51,180
There is something.

774
01:09:51,450 --> 01:09:53,660
Oh God! Then tell us soon.

775
01:09:55,780 --> 01:09:57,480
You won't be able to bear it.

776
01:09:57,710 --> 01:10:00,320
You shouted so loudly,
I heard that too.

777
01:10:02,940 --> 01:10:05,800
Then listen.
I'm not your brother's friend.

778
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:10,730
Oh my God! Then who are you?

779
01:10:11,020 --> 01:10:12,890
Whoever I am,
I'm not your brother's friend.

780
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:17,140
Can you see this hand?

781
01:10:18,410 --> 01:10:20,410
A man with such a hand
can't be anybody's friend.

782
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:22,600
This hand is dirty.

783
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:25,020
Dirty? Not at all.

784
01:10:25,170 --> 01:10:26,770
It's your fault you can't see it.

785
01:10:27,380 --> 01:10:30,460
If you see the blood on this hand
you'll scream loudly.

786
01:10:32,190 --> 01:10:33,990
This hand has been dipped
in blood, Shruti.

787
01:10:34,550 --> 01:10:37,230
It was headed towards gold and silver
but ended up covered in blood.

788
01:10:38,820 --> 01:10:40,420
Will you do something for me?

789
01:10:42,910 --> 01:10:44,610
Take my hand away.
Amputate my hand.

790
01:10:47,260 --> 01:10:49,350
Cut off my hands.
They drive me mad.

791
01:10:54,830 --> 01:10:56,900
Sir, may I ask you something?

792
01:10:58,070 --> 01:11:00,290
Are you mad?

793
01:11:01,710 --> 01:11:03,010
Yes, I'm mad.

794
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:06,740
This one hand has driven me mad
and left me nowhere to go.

795
01:11:07,550 --> 01:11:10,230
It has left me to die.
I don't need it.

796
01:11:11,710 --> 01:11:13,110
What have you done?

797
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:16,780
Come, come to our house.

798
01:11:17,450 --> 01:11:19,146
You and tell us your whole story.

799
01:11:19,170 --> 01:11:20,466
You'll feel better.

800
01:11:20,490 --> 01:11:22,190
This heart will never
feel light again.

801
01:11:22,830 --> 01:11:24,630
It has the weight of a dead body.

802
01:11:42,590 --> 01:11:45,470
Roshan, wait there.

803
01:11:48,290 --> 01:11:51,370
Where are you going? A man's
pockets are filled with money.

804
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:52,696
Come with me.

805
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:54,110
I don't want money.

806
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:55,380
Roshan.

807
01:11:56,140 --> 01:11:58,970
If it's increasing then let
it increase. Very good.

808
01:11:59,460 --> 01:12:01,160
If nothing else, it should be profitable.

809
01:12:05,130 --> 01:12:06,230
Roshan.

810
01:12:06,370 --> 01:12:07,766
Okay, we'll talk later.

811
01:12:07,790 --> 01:12:08,990
Come in, come in.

812
01:12:11,730 --> 01:12:13,890
Where have you been all this time?
When did you return?

813
01:12:14,780 --> 01:12:17,120
Remember, once you offered me a job?

814
01:12:17,380 --> 01:12:19,220
- Yes, yes.
- And I refused it.

815
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:23,140
Today I need that job.

816
01:12:23,190 --> 01:12:26,460
Job? My friend, you're
the boss of this place.

817
01:12:27,390 --> 01:12:29,550
- So, I start tomorrow morning?
- Not tomorrow morning.

818
01:12:30,310 --> 01:12:32,900
Evening, seven o'clock. Okay?

819
01:12:35,210 --> 01:12:36,310
Bye.

820
01:12:38,220 --> 01:12:39,720
Mother! Mother, Roshan has come.

821
01:12:39,810 --> 01:12:43,030
Where is he? Where is my son?

822
01:12:45,110 --> 01:12:47,020
Without telling me, don't go anywhere.

823
01:12:47,650 --> 01:12:50,220
I cried so much, I was half dead.

824
01:12:50,780 --> 01:12:53,890
God bless Dabbo.
He came and told us...

825
01:12:53,950 --> 01:12:56,610
you had to go out
on some important business.

826
01:12:56,740 --> 01:13:00,830
Yes mother, that work
was very important.

827
01:13:01,070 --> 01:13:06,350
If Roshan refused to go,
he'd lose his job.

828
01:13:06,900 --> 01:13:09,060
- What say, Roshan?
- Yes, mother, something like that.

829
01:13:09,350 --> 01:13:12,740
Son, this lonely house
came to kill me.

830
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:16,170
You get married soon.
I want a girl here.

831
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:18,540
Girl, which girl?

832
01:13:19,070 --> 01:13:22,520
Now it's no use hiding.
I know everything.

833
01:13:22,690 --> 01:13:23,990
About what, mother?

834
01:13:24,090 --> 01:13:26,350
About yours and Kamla's affair.

835
01:13:26,630 --> 01:13:28,250
Kamla, who is this Kamala?

836
01:13:28,610 --> 01:13:30,520
The one you want to marry..

837
01:13:30,740 --> 01:13:32,400
- Me?
- Yes, Kamla.

838
01:13:32,790 --> 01:13:35,920
Daughter Kamla,
just see who has come.

839
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:37,480
Coming, mother.

840
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:52,810
Daughter Kamla, isn't this the boy
you want to marry?

841
01:13:54,900 --> 01:13:58,280
Come on mother, the food is ready.

842
01:13:59,150 --> 01:14:03,040
Did you see that son?
I'm very lucky.

843
01:14:03,900 --> 01:14:06,100
Only a lucky person will get
such a daughter-in-law.

844
01:14:06,950 --> 01:14:09,130
She helps me so much that even...

845
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:11,560
our own girls don't
help us so much.

846
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:14,550
She is a form of Goddess, Goddess.

847
01:14:14,980 --> 01:14:16,130
Come in.

848
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:27,480
Dabbo, what's this?

849
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:33,010
You want to know
how Rita became Kamla?

850
01:14:33,390 --> 01:14:37,120
So listen friend, your physique,
your attitude...

851
01:14:37,420 --> 01:14:40,510
your beauty made her helpless...

852
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:42,590
and she became Kamla from Rita...

853
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:45,110
and for two days she's been
washing dishes here.

854
01:14:45,980 --> 01:14:47,800
You're very lucky, friend.

855
01:14:47,960 --> 01:14:49,560
Nobody dies for us.

856
01:14:56,830 --> 01:14:58,430
The sweets are made well, sister.

857
01:15:04,950 --> 01:15:06,490
So sister, your decision?

858
01:15:06,940 --> 01:15:09,260
Sister, I liked your daughter a lot.

859
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:13,020
It's a very good thing.
I like your son a lot.

860
01:15:13,650 --> 01:15:15,050
God bless this couple.

861
01:15:15,950 --> 01:15:17,750
Daughter, seek your
mother-in-law's blessing.

862
01:15:18,170 --> 01:15:19,966
A mother-in-law is
the same as your mother.

863
01:15:19,990 --> 01:15:21,960
But a husband is also equal to God.

864
01:15:22,670 --> 01:15:24,160
First touch my feet.

865
01:15:24,580 --> 01:15:27,890
I want to see, after getting married...

866
01:15:27,950 --> 01:15:29,950
whether she obeys my orders or not?

867
01:15:30,020 --> 01:15:31,620
- What's all this?
- Yes, sister...

868
01:15:31,650 --> 01:15:33,350
- the boy speaks the truth.
- But sister...

869
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:45,930
Oh God, is she a girl
or a body builder?

870
01:15:46,250 --> 01:15:47,550
Leave my child.

871
01:15:47,590 --> 01:15:49,510
Mother! Mother, I'll marry only her.

872
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:52,560
- Your wedding is over.
- Mother!

873
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:54,530
Wait sister, at least listen.

874
01:15:57,870 --> 01:15:59,850
Stupid girl, if you keep
behaving like this...

875
01:15:59,900 --> 01:16:01,400
then who will marry you?

876
01:16:02,460 --> 01:16:03,860
Who will marry me?

877
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:07,290
Mother, this world is very big.

878
01:16:08,110 --> 01:16:09,730
Somebody must be there for me.

879
01:16:15,580 --> 01:16:17,290
Uncle, when did you become blind?

880
01:16:18,690 --> 01:16:20,600
This is the coat of the big men.

881
01:16:21,060 --> 01:16:24,550
- Where'd you get it?
- That man left it before leaving.

882
01:16:24,890 --> 01:16:26,290
How do I look?

883
01:16:32,310 --> 01:16:36,530
Uncle, uncle, uncle!

884
01:16:37,140 --> 01:16:38,740
When did you become my aunt?

885
01:16:38,790 --> 01:16:41,690
Since a ladies necklace
has decorated my neck.

886
01:16:44,660 --> 01:16:46,656
This is gold.
Where'd you get it?

887
01:16:46,680 --> 01:16:47,980
It's also his.

888
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:49,790
It was in the coat pocket.

889
01:16:50,060 --> 01:16:51,510
Really? Let me see.

890
01:16:54,580 --> 01:16:56,410
- I look good.
- You look very pretty.

891
01:17:14,710 --> 01:17:16,010
- Mother?
- Go away.

892
01:17:16,230 --> 01:17:18,030
I don't even want to see your face.

893
01:17:18,990 --> 01:17:20,890
Who's telling you
to look at my face, mother?

894
01:17:21,230 --> 01:17:22,750
Look at this necklace.

895
01:17:23,970 --> 01:17:27,190
Necklace, oh my God.
This is made of gold.

896
01:17:27,480 --> 01:17:29,960
- Where'd you get it?
- I didn't get it, mother.

897
01:17:30,260 --> 01:17:32,260
Brother's friend, that mad man,
he left his coat...

898
01:17:32,860 --> 01:17:34,640
at Manglu uncle's house.

899
01:17:35,170 --> 01:17:37,000
The necklace was found
in the coat pocket.

900
01:17:37,780 --> 01:17:39,180
- What say uncle?
- Yes.

901
01:17:41,410 --> 01:17:43,090
And I also have this photograph.

902
01:17:43,750 --> 01:17:45,050
Let me see.

903
01:17:45,370 --> 01:17:46,670
Oh my God!

904
01:17:49,020 --> 01:17:50,216
So shameless!

905
01:17:50,240 --> 01:17:53,680
No skirt, no dress and to
top it such a short dress.

906
01:17:53,850 --> 01:17:56,320
This is the trend nowadays, Sukal.

907
01:17:56,500 --> 01:17:59,250
The more high class, the higher the dress.

908
01:18:01,350 --> 01:18:02,746
What are you doing?

909
01:18:02,770 --> 01:18:04,350
I'll keep this with me.

910
01:18:04,940 --> 01:18:06,540
- You'll make pickle from this?
- No.

911
01:18:06,720 --> 01:18:10,980
If God wishes then I will
get your aunt very soon.

912
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:16,490
I was laughing.
How did I start crying?

913
01:18:22,290 --> 01:18:25,780
Mother, I am dead.

914
01:18:26,140 --> 01:18:27,540
Handcuff.

915
01:18:28,570 --> 01:18:31,630
I'm dying a dog's life, mother.

916
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:34,160
What's all this Mr. Ladoo Shah.
Tell us something.

917
01:18:35,010 --> 01:18:38,216
Mother, what had to happen.

918
01:18:38,240 --> 01:18:40,040
I'm a small man of this small village.

919
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:42,786
And I have this enmity
with the government.

920
01:18:42,810 --> 01:18:44,360
Shut up. Get behind.

921
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:51,830
Mother, is it true your house
was mortgaged to him for 3,000 rupees?

922
01:18:52,050 --> 01:18:55,020
- Yes.
- And you've repaid that loan?

923
01:18:55,310 --> 01:18:56,610
Yes, yes sure.

924
01:18:56,740 --> 01:18:59,850
May I ask where you
got those 3,000 rupees?

925
01:19:00,420 --> 01:19:02,050
Where would we get it?

926
01:19:02,610 --> 01:19:04,770
My son's friend came from Bombay.

927
01:19:05,590 --> 01:19:08,330
He couldn't bear our condition.
He repaid it.

928
01:19:09,310 --> 01:19:11,160
I didn't see him again before he went.

929
01:19:11,690 --> 01:19:15,550
Please be kind enough to give
his and your son's address.

930
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:17,580
I don't know the address of either.

931
01:19:17,770 --> 01:19:21,070
How is it possible you don't
even know your sons address?

932
01:19:21,530 --> 01:19:23,460
He only left for Bombay a month ago.

933
01:19:24,170 --> 01:19:26,210
Since then I haven't received
any letters from him..

934
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:28,750
But son, what's the problem?

935
01:19:29,090 --> 01:19:30,490
That money was stolen.

936
01:19:30,650 --> 01:19:33,790
No, no, my son wouldn't do that.

937
01:19:34,020 --> 01:19:35,220
He's innocent.

938
01:19:47,330 --> 01:19:51,280
Roshan, you must have heard
the names of the famous markets.

939
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:57,420
Crawford market, New market,
Share market...

940
01:19:57,850 --> 01:20:04,050
Mangaldas market, and the biggest
market. It's this market.

941
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:13,770
In this market lakhs
of gambling take place...

942
01:20:14,460 --> 01:20:15,760
in the darkness.

943
01:20:20,110 --> 01:20:22,590
Keep watching friend,
over the pride of this market.

944
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:26,130
In this market, things worth thousands...

945
01:20:26,190 --> 01:20:29,380
get shuffled from here to there
in the darkness.

946
01:20:30,050 --> 01:20:32,800
Here all the deals happen at night.

947
01:20:33,300 --> 01:20:34,396
Understand?

948
01:20:34,420 --> 01:20:36,750
Our friendship also blossomed
in this darkness.

949
01:20:36,990 --> 01:20:40,270
And in that same darkness,
I switched that chain.

950
01:20:40,810 --> 01:20:43,420
Roshan, I am the king of darkness.

951
01:20:44,720 --> 01:20:46,890
And what will I have to do?

952
01:20:47,460 --> 01:20:49,580
What'll you have to do?
I'll just show you.

953
01:20:51,430 --> 01:20:52,730
Come with me.

954
01:20:53,290 --> 01:20:54,700
Two, three and four.

955
01:20:56,810 --> 01:20:58,410
Then all the money is mine.

956
01:20:58,630 --> 01:21:00,030
I have triple aces.

957
01:21:00,290 --> 01:21:01,390
Stop.

958
01:21:05,410 --> 01:21:08,300
These are his real cards.
It's all yours now.

959
01:21:08,450 --> 01:21:10,250
Forgive me sir. I won't do it again.

960
01:21:10,840 --> 01:21:13,200
Shut up! Throw him out.

961
01:21:20,490 --> 01:21:23,570
What ever I did just now.
Did you see it properly?

962
01:21:26,020 --> 01:21:27,120
Come.

963
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:32,530
All this work
will be done by you now.

964
01:21:33,340 --> 01:21:35,100
But Roshan, keep one thing in mind.

965
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:38,610
That in Shamshed Seth's lair, gambling...

966
01:21:39,340 --> 01:21:40,960
black marketing can be carried out.

967
01:21:41,650 --> 01:21:43,150
But cheating won't be tolerated.

968
01:21:43,780 --> 01:21:46,780
Sir, I won't work for you.

969
01:21:47,370 --> 01:21:49,590
What did you say? You won't work?

970
01:21:52,950 --> 01:21:55,690
Yes, I won't work.

971
01:21:57,260 --> 01:21:59,790
I came to you to gain freedom
from this hand.

972
01:22:00,690 --> 01:22:02,750
I thought you were a
kind and honest person...

973
01:22:03,380 --> 01:22:04,980
a person earning his living honestly.

974
01:22:05,890 --> 01:22:08,620
I didn't know you were
one of those people...

975
01:22:08,680 --> 01:22:10,880
who hides the whole world's
poison of crimes.

976
01:22:14,060 --> 01:22:16,630
Just like you, my work was also
done in the night's darkness.

977
01:22:17,740 --> 01:22:19,340
But I hate this darkness now.

978
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:23,350
I'm searching for that person
who'll show me the right path.

979
01:22:25,290 --> 01:22:26,790
I won't work for you.

980
01:22:33,910 --> 01:22:37,350
Mr. Thief, his whole life he's
been picking pockets.

981
01:22:37,700 --> 01:22:40,210
And now he wants to leave it all.

982
01:22:45,590 --> 01:22:49,330
You'll get your bright light from
the red light of the police station.

983
01:22:52,520 --> 01:22:55,360
The death sentence will
bring light into your life.

984
01:22:55,390 --> 01:22:59,790
When a professional criminal
says he wants to go straight...

985
01:23:00,190 --> 01:23:02,120
then he's the biggest fool.

986
01:23:03,930 --> 01:23:05,230
You're a fool.

987
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:07,850
You're a fool, fool.

988
01:23:09,270 --> 01:23:11,240
Like me, you're all fools too.

989
01:23:13,680 --> 01:23:16,160
In the river of crime,
you're all vulnerable.

990
01:23:17,290 --> 01:23:20,560
And to hide this vulnerability,
you all stand together and laugh.

991
01:23:22,100 --> 01:23:26,740
But remember this; one day this
laughter will leave your lips.

992
01:23:27,830 --> 01:23:30,470
And, like me, you'll also want freedom
from this criminal world.

993
01:23:32,170 --> 01:23:34,730
You'll suffer to get rid
of the felony charges.

994
01:23:35,230 --> 01:23:38,516
You'll cry and ask somebody
to cut off your hands and legs...

995
01:23:38,540 --> 01:23:40,136
and to make you an invalid.

996
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:43,120
You'll ask them to throw you in the
burning fire and do anything they wish.

997
01:23:43,380 --> 01:23:46,050
But you'll ask them to give you
a moment of respect and honesty.

998
01:23:46,830 --> 01:23:48,830
Even if it's a death sentence.

999
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:03,000
Roshan, wait.

1000
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:16,210
At least wait and see
how your lecture...

1001
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:19,820
has affected us.

1002
01:24:25,100 --> 01:24:28,110
So you've really turned honest?

1003
01:24:33,990 --> 01:24:35,290
An honest pickpocket?

1004
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:40,590
What do we goons have?

1005
01:24:51,270 --> 01:24:54,360
Go along with the world, friend

1006
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:57,800
Don't repent like this, friend

1007
01:24:58,340 --> 01:25:01,816
Life is short. Spend it in laughter

1008
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:04,990
It's the trend of life, my friend

1009
01:25:40,870 --> 01:25:47,470
When the heart is young,
the world seems beautiful

1010
01:25:47,830 --> 01:25:54,860
Enjoy that life is momentary

1011
01:26:12,640 --> 01:26:19,660
This spring of youth may
not return again, my dear!

1012
01:26:19,740 --> 01:26:22,690
Go along with the world friend

1013
01:26:23,180 --> 01:26:26,120
Don't repent like this, friend

1014
01:26:55,190 --> 01:26:58,100
These mesmerizing nights
are very few

1015
01:26:58,550 --> 01:27:01,830
Don't bother yourself
with the monotonous

1016
01:27:02,250 --> 01:27:05,300
Behind the sun of happiness

1017
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:09,240
Showers of sorrows await you

1018
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:29,606
All the rules are useless

1019
01:27:29,630 --> 01:27:33,700
Don't lose even one moment, friend

1020
01:27:33,730 --> 01:27:36,630
Go along with the world friend

1021
01:27:37,230 --> 01:27:40,170
Don't repent like this, friend

1022
01:27:40,710 --> 01:27:44,190
Life is short. Spend it in laughter

1023
01:27:44,230 --> 01:27:47,390
It's the trend of life, my friend

1024
01:28:05,540 --> 01:28:07,840
You did a good thing
by refusing Shankar's job.

1025
01:28:09,530 --> 01:28:12,870
But whatever you've seen here,
just forget everything.

1026
01:28:13,820 --> 01:28:15,420
Don't speak about it to anybody.

1027
01:28:16,610 --> 01:28:18,210
Shankar is a very bad man.

1028
01:28:19,890 --> 01:28:23,030
It's not good to have
either friendship or enmity with him.

1029
01:28:26,390 --> 01:28:27,790
What are you thinking?

1030
01:28:29,500 --> 01:28:30,900
What am I thinking?

1031
01:28:37,500 --> 01:28:39,290
I feel like strangling you.

1032
01:28:41,880 --> 01:28:44,161
During the day you sit like
an innocent women in my house.

1033
01:28:45,070 --> 01:28:46,830
You made my mother believe only you...

1034
01:28:47,330 --> 01:28:48,930
were fit to be her daughter-in-law.

1035
01:28:49,770 --> 01:28:51,610
And now you were dancing
among those hooligans.

1036
01:28:52,240 --> 01:28:54,360
- Why all the drama?
- You're so clever.

1037
01:28:55,540 --> 01:28:57,620
You asked the question
and then answered it yourself.

1038
01:29:04,860 --> 01:29:06,360
That is actually a drama.

1039
01:29:07,360 --> 01:29:10,730
When I went to your house,
I was acting.

1040
01:29:12,440 --> 01:29:13,940
Marriage was just an excuse.

1041
01:29:14,980 --> 01:29:18,020
I went for those 3,000 rupees
you stole from Mohan.

1042
01:29:19,910 --> 01:29:21,310
Shankar sent me there.

1043
01:29:21,770 --> 01:29:23,070
Shankar sent you?

1044
01:29:23,980 --> 01:29:25,080
Why?

1045
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:29,401
What connection does Shankar
have with those 3,000 rupees?

1046
01:29:29,700 --> 01:29:31,100
That money was Shankar's.

1047
01:29:32,330 --> 01:29:33,630
I stole it.

1048
01:29:36,380 --> 01:29:38,426
I also wondered,
how in just two meetings...

1049
01:29:38,450 --> 01:29:40,046
you became so friendly with me...

1050
01:29:40,070 --> 01:29:42,170
that to become my wife
you came to my house yourself.

1051
01:29:43,590 --> 01:29:45,880
Today I learn you didn't want a husband,
only the money.

1052
01:29:46,150 --> 01:29:47,940
Don't take advantage
of my honesty.

1053
01:29:48,860 --> 01:29:50,820
I already told you I wanted to cheat.

1054
01:29:52,180 --> 01:29:56,030
It's because of your mother
my world has changed.

1055
01:29:57,440 --> 01:29:58,940
When she sings the hymn...

1056
01:29:59,550 --> 01:30:01,610
goodness can be seen on her face.

1057
01:30:03,070 --> 01:30:04,720
And then her motherly feelings...

1058
01:30:06,120 --> 01:30:09,300
she fed me food with her own hands.

1059
01:30:09,880 --> 01:30:12,090
As if I'm not any stranger,
but her own daughter.

1060
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:17,540
Seeing her love, I had
the dream of a new life.

1061
01:30:18,220 --> 01:30:20,380
Something screamed
from deep in my heart.

1062
01:30:20,930 --> 01:30:23,430
"Open your eyes Rita,
this is your house."

1063
01:30:24,610 --> 01:30:26,010
"This is your mother."

1064
01:30:27,320 --> 01:30:28,900
Say you'll accept me, Roshan.

1065
01:30:30,740 --> 01:30:32,440
You'll take me out of this hell.

1066
01:30:32,970 --> 01:30:34,670
Will you come with me right now?

1067
01:30:37,420 --> 01:30:38,920
I can't come now, Roshan.

1068
01:30:40,790 --> 01:30:42,450
Shankar has given me an assignment.

1069
01:30:44,030 --> 01:30:45,830
Until I return the 3,000 rupees to him...

1070
01:30:46,670 --> 01:30:48,270
I won't be able to leave.

1071
01:30:51,110 --> 01:30:52,710
If you give the money back...

1072
01:30:52,770 --> 01:30:54,710
I'm ready to come with you right now.

1073
01:30:55,040 --> 01:30:56,640
I gave that money to someone.

1074
01:31:02,620 --> 01:31:04,220
Now I can't get it back.

1075
01:31:08,060 --> 01:31:09,760
You don't need to get it back.

1076
01:31:11,290 --> 01:31:13,190
Whoever you gave it to,
give me their address.

1077
01:31:14,310 --> 01:31:15,710
Shankar will get it.

1078
01:31:17,240 --> 01:31:18,450
- Tell me.
- No.

1079
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:20,560
I can't give you their address.

1080
01:31:21,220 --> 01:31:22,920
They need that money
more than Shankar.

1081
01:31:24,540 --> 01:31:26,940
So, does this mean
you don't love me?

1082
01:31:30,940 --> 01:31:32,940
Do I love you or not?
What do you think?

1083
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:35,260
I only know the woman...

1084
01:31:36,200 --> 01:31:40,260
who'll be my partner in life and death.
I'll never betray her.

1085
01:31:43,750 --> 01:31:48,110
If you want to marry this women,
you'll have to buy her.

1086
01:31:48,980 --> 01:31:50,580
You have to pay her cost.

1087
01:31:51,530 --> 01:31:54,320
Get away from here. Go away.

1088
01:32:11,210 --> 01:32:14,420
- Sir, sir.
- Sir, sir!

1089
01:32:16,930 --> 01:32:19,640
- How did you come here?
- We came to return the coat.

1090
01:32:20,220 --> 01:32:22,130
But how did you know
you'd see me here?

1091
01:32:22,610 --> 01:32:26,250
In the coat pocket we found
this necklace and this advertisement.

1092
01:32:27,890 --> 01:32:32,890
We thought we'd get your address
from the woman in the photograph.

1093
01:32:33,020 --> 01:32:35,700
Yes, and while looking for you,
we wound up here.

1094
01:32:35,830 --> 01:32:37,430
But, what you did was wrong.

1095
01:32:37,930 --> 01:32:39,116
Why wrong?

1096
01:32:39,140 --> 01:32:40,736
I've come here
to meet my brother.

1097
01:32:40,760 --> 01:32:43,440
- Take me to my brother.
- To your brother?

1098
01:32:44,790 --> 01:32:49,190
Your brother, the thing is that...

1099
01:32:58,630 --> 01:33:00,600
Come on Shaku,
I'll take you to your brother.

1100
01:33:01,180 --> 01:33:02,280
Taxi!

1101
01:33:06,700 --> 01:33:09,640
Shankar, did you notice something?

1102
01:33:10,170 --> 01:33:11,270
What?

1103
01:33:12,550 --> 01:33:14,050
The girl has the same chain...

1104
01:33:15,880 --> 01:33:17,680
you robbed from Mohan
and gave to me.

1105
01:33:18,570 --> 01:33:19,670
Really?

1106
01:33:24,660 --> 01:33:28,880
Uncle, I can't see, but maybe.

1107
01:33:30,590 --> 01:33:33,030
I can't see either, but maybe.

1108
01:33:34,760 --> 01:33:37,360
What is this maybe?
What can't you see?

1109
01:33:37,810 --> 01:33:38,910
Thief!

1110
01:33:39,840 --> 01:33:41,840
You don't look like a thief
from your face, sir.

1111
01:33:42,340 --> 01:33:43,940
What have I stolen of yours?

1112
01:33:45,130 --> 01:33:47,010
Before now, you haven't stolen
anything of mine.

1113
01:33:47,390 --> 01:33:49,520
But you've given stolen goods to others.

1114
01:33:50,310 --> 01:33:52,610
Stolen goods? Who says so?

1115
01:33:53,420 --> 01:33:55,710
We don't say so, sir,
the police say so.

1116
01:33:56,530 --> 01:33:59,400
The three notes of 1000 each
that you gave to Ladoo Shah...

1117
01:33:59,770 --> 01:34:01,190
those notes were stolen.

1118
01:34:02,280 --> 01:34:05,150
Yes and the police have taken
Ladoo Shah with them.

1119
01:34:06,660 --> 01:34:08,930
That money is stolen?

1120
01:34:10,600 --> 01:34:12,400
The police are mistaken, Shukal.

1121
01:34:13,400 --> 01:34:15,370
Don't worry. After taking
you to your brother...

1122
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:17,490
I'll go straight to the
police commissioner.

1123
01:34:17,830 --> 01:34:19,530
And the whole problem
will be solved.

1124
01:34:19,900 --> 01:34:22,220
So, you have contacts
with the police commissioner as well?

1125
01:34:22,410 --> 01:34:24,310
Uncle, not only contact...

1126
01:34:24,640 --> 01:34:26,240
I'm their guest every other day.

1127
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:28,500
They treat me very well.

1128
01:34:29,240 --> 01:34:30,570
Then you're an important man.

1129
01:34:30,750 --> 01:34:32,350
One day I'll come with you.

1130
01:34:32,420 --> 01:34:33,820
Uncle, don't you worry.

1131
01:34:41,770 --> 01:34:43,170
Here's your brother's house.

1132
01:34:54,670 --> 01:34:56,270
Wait here while I call him.

1133
01:35:05,160 --> 01:35:07,070
- Brother.
- Keep quiet. I'll be back.

1134
01:35:15,700 --> 01:35:17,000
Who is it?

1135
01:35:17,720 --> 01:35:19,320
- Roshan!
- Call Mohan.

1136
01:35:22,360 --> 01:35:23,940
- Mohan?
- Yes, Mohan.

1137
01:35:23,990 --> 01:35:26,180
His sister and uncle
are here from the village.

1138
01:35:26,700 --> 01:35:27,900
Where's Mohan?

1139
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:34,240
Our Mohan, his sister and uncle.

1140
01:35:34,950 --> 01:35:37,570
Come in sister, come inside.

1141
01:35:38,620 --> 01:35:40,020
Come in uncle, come.

1142
01:35:40,480 --> 01:35:44,060
Brother, brother.

1143
01:35:46,110 --> 01:35:48,590
- Where's my brother?
- Sit, sister. Sit.

1144
01:35:50,490 --> 01:35:53,760
Just yesterday Mohan went
to Calcutta on important business.

1145
01:35:55,110 --> 01:35:57,360
- Brother went to Calcutta?
- Yes, yes, Calcutta.

1146
01:35:58,140 --> 01:35:59,930
But sir, you said in the village...

1147
01:36:00,130 --> 01:36:01,830
the latest journey was
brother's last one.

1148
01:36:02,170 --> 01:36:04,760
I did say, Shuki, but the thing is...

1149
01:36:05,780 --> 01:36:09,570
in life and work you don't
know when things will change.

1150
01:36:10,660 --> 01:36:11,846
Don't worry.

1151
01:36:11,870 --> 01:36:14,166
I'll send a telegram to your brother
telling him to return at once.

1152
01:36:14,190 --> 01:36:15,690
That his sister has come.

1153
01:36:16,220 --> 01:36:19,960
And tell him his sister
brought his birthday sweets.

1154
01:36:20,240 --> 01:36:21,810
- Come back soon.
- I'll write.

1155
01:36:27,850 --> 01:36:30,300
Roshan, Roshan, what are you doing?

1156
01:36:30,580 --> 01:36:32,080
You're hiding death from them.

1157
01:36:32,550 --> 01:36:34,050
I'm hiding my crime Dabbo.

1158
01:36:34,450 --> 01:36:35,946
It's more dangerous than death.

1159
01:36:35,970 --> 01:36:37,770
When the time comes to tell the truth...

1160
01:36:37,810 --> 01:36:39,410
it won't be any less dangerous.

1161
01:36:39,560 --> 01:36:41,260
I hope before that I die, Dabbo.

1162
01:36:57,800 --> 01:37:01,820
- Inspector.
- You have to come with me to the police station.

1163
01:37:03,830 --> 01:37:05,620
From your statement it can be proved...

1164
01:37:06,120 --> 01:37:07,900
you got the money from the envelope...

1165
01:37:08,220 --> 01:37:09,720
you took from Mohan's pocket.

1166
01:37:10,510 --> 01:37:12,270
And Mohan stole those notes from Shankar.

1167
01:37:12,830 --> 01:37:13,930
Yes.

1168
01:37:13,990 --> 01:37:15,676
You must have read in the paper...

1169
01:37:15,700 --> 01:37:17,860
that last March,
the Universal Bank was robbed.

1170
01:37:18,570 --> 01:37:20,410
Those men took 20 lakh rupees.

1171
01:37:21,450 --> 01:37:23,050
They were all 1,000 rupee bills.

1172
01:37:23,910 --> 01:37:25,610
These 3 notes are from that robbery.

1173
01:37:28,340 --> 01:37:31,080
That's why Shankar wants them back.

1174
01:37:31,540 --> 01:37:33,500
He must be stressed that
anybody who takes this...

1175
01:37:33,750 --> 01:37:36,470
money with them to the market
will be immediately caught.

1176
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:38,826
Because lists with the numbers
on these notes...

1177
01:37:38,850 --> 01:37:40,750
were sent to all the shops,
banks and markets.

1178
01:37:40,840 --> 01:37:42,340
Then you arrest Shankar immediately.

1179
01:37:42,700 --> 01:37:45,060
But to arrest him, I need valid proof.

1180
01:37:47,260 --> 01:37:53,800
Oh, you can't arrest Shankar
because you don't have any proof yet.

1181
01:38:03,380 --> 01:38:04,780
Why are you laughing?

1182
01:38:05,150 --> 01:38:07,510
I always thought before now
that once you look at someone...

1183
01:38:07,560 --> 01:38:11,360
that person would fall at your feet.

1184
01:38:11,870 --> 01:38:13,740
But it's a very sad thing...

1185
01:38:14,080 --> 01:38:16,670
that an ordinary pickpocket
rejected you and left.

1186
01:38:17,030 --> 01:38:19,820
No boss, I didn't reject her.

1187
01:38:21,040 --> 01:38:23,040
I went to make arrangements
for the 3,000 rupees.

1188
01:38:26,680 --> 01:38:29,410
These are the notes for which
you were ready to sell yourself.

1189
01:38:31,990 --> 01:38:33,990
If you want to marry me,
come to my house.

1190
01:38:40,480 --> 01:38:43,160
If you want to marry me,
come to my house.

1191
01:38:45,630 --> 01:38:47,130
Thank you Rita, thank you.

1192
01:38:47,750 --> 01:38:50,770
Your plan worked,
but a bit late.

1193
01:38:52,420 --> 01:38:56,610
No surprise. Even I'm affected
by this poison.

1194
01:39:02,890 --> 01:39:04,590
Inspector, at least give me a cigarette.

1195
01:39:08,870 --> 01:39:11,590
Roshan, the trick you just played...

1196
01:39:12,750 --> 01:39:14,350
are you sure of its success?

1197
01:39:15,350 --> 01:39:16,980
May I ask you something, inspector?

1198
01:39:17,490 --> 01:39:18,790
Think and answer.

1199
01:39:19,750 --> 01:39:20,950
Ask me.

1200
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:24,600
First, look at my face carefully.

1201
01:39:24,900 --> 01:39:26,200
Am I handsome?

1202
01:39:33,890 --> 01:39:35,390
Why, what are your plans?

1203
01:39:35,510 --> 01:39:36,810
You're very handsome.

1204
01:39:38,640 --> 01:39:42,440
Okay inspector, if 10, 2050
girls are standing...

1205
01:39:43,410 --> 01:39:46,180
and I go and tell them
I want to marry one of them.

1206
01:39:47,490 --> 01:39:50,470
Then will one of those
girls agree to marry me?

1207
01:39:50,860 --> 01:39:53,720
They'll hold a lottery
to see who gets you, Roshan.

1208
01:39:54,760 --> 01:39:56,060
If true, lnspector...

1209
01:39:56,860 --> 01:39:58,760
then Rita will surely be trapped in my net.

1210
01:40:00,220 --> 01:40:01,620
Go and sleep peacefully.

1211
01:40:02,110 --> 01:40:03,800
Come on, I'll take you home.

1212
01:40:05,180 --> 01:40:08,180
I'll go walking.
I want to think things over.

1213
01:40:12,550 --> 01:40:13,750
Early morning!

1214
01:40:16,780 --> 01:40:21,360
You said, if I want to marry you,
come to your house.

1215
01:40:23,460 --> 01:40:26,550
- When will we marry?
- Marriage? Now, this moment!

1216
01:40:26,990 --> 01:40:28,500
- Come with me.
- Wait.

1217
01:40:30,460 --> 01:40:32,060
First, let's get mother's blessings.

1218
01:40:32,430 --> 01:40:36,050
Darling, if you get mother's blessings
then we can't marry.

1219
01:40:36,880 --> 01:40:37,980
Why?

1220
01:40:38,120 --> 01:40:39,616
Doesn't she like our relationship?

1221
01:40:39,640 --> 01:40:41,830
Here's the problem.
She likes this relationship a lot.

1222
01:40:42,380 --> 01:40:43,876
She'll ask for a ceremony.

1223
01:40:43,900 --> 01:40:46,480
Call the priest, stitch new clothes,
make jewelry and for all.

1224
01:40:46,510 --> 01:40:49,390
These preparations will take
at least 6 months.

1225
01:40:49,590 --> 01:40:51,890
To wait for 6 months
is no less dangerous.

1226
01:40:52,150 --> 01:40:53,550
What's dangerous about it?

1227
01:40:55,900 --> 01:40:57,296
Now I'm all yours.

1228
01:40:57,320 --> 01:40:59,720
Darling, before marriage
there's a lot of danger.

1229
01:41:00,380 --> 01:41:01,576
Why so?

1230
01:41:01,600 --> 01:41:04,040
Do you again feel pity for Shankar?

1231
01:41:06,800 --> 01:41:09,140
If that's the reason,
let's get married now.

1232
01:41:09,540 --> 01:41:12,640
See darling, an engagement and
a quick marriage also take time.

1233
01:41:13,390 --> 01:41:14,590
Doesn't it?

1234
01:41:14,650 --> 01:41:17,630
You go home. I'll get the priest.

1235
01:41:19,860 --> 01:41:20,960
Okay?

1236
01:41:29,270 --> 01:41:30,820
Inspector Rajan speaking.

1237
01:41:31,710 --> 01:41:33,780
Roshan, say brother, how are you?

1238
01:41:34,470 --> 01:41:36,350
Inspector, we've got the
lottery on Rita's name.

1239
01:41:37,130 --> 01:41:38,740
I'm marrying her at 5:00 today.

1240
01:41:39,250 --> 01:41:41,450
Yes. You be there
at the right time.

1241
01:41:42,420 --> 01:41:44,540
Yes. You remember your promise, right?

1242
01:41:44,590 --> 01:41:45,890
Don't worry Roshan.

1243
01:41:46,070 --> 01:41:48,020
Ms. Rita's name
won't be mentioned at all.

1244
01:41:48,710 --> 01:41:51,700
Ms. Rita is only a way
of getting to the real culprits.

1245
01:41:52,370 --> 01:41:53,670
There's something else.

1246
01:41:54,070 --> 01:41:56,540
If I'm successful in capturing
the real criminals...

1247
01:41:57,340 --> 01:41:59,621
then my name will be removed
from the list of pickpockets.

1248
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:03,250
Yes, dear, yes. Your name will be removed
from the pickpocker list...

1249
01:42:03,640 --> 01:42:05,530
and added to the names
of honest people.

1250
01:42:06,460 --> 01:42:09,410
Roshan, if possible, come here first.

1251
01:42:10,080 --> 01:42:11,480
No inspector, not now.

1252
01:42:12,040 --> 01:42:13,920
I'm going to the one I love.

1253
01:42:14,720 --> 01:42:16,320
She must be waiting for me.

1254
01:42:16,760 --> 01:42:17,860
Tata.

1255
01:42:38,950 --> 01:42:40,050
Shuk...

1256
01:42:42,870 --> 01:42:43,970
Shuk...

1257
01:42:46,760 --> 01:42:48,240
Shuk, shuk!

1258
01:42:50,480 --> 01:42:56,710
Don't scream so loudly sir.
It hurts my ears.

1259
01:42:57,230 --> 01:43:00,880
Don't fall fast asleep.
It's difficult to awaken you.

1260
01:43:01,930 --> 01:43:03,530
Where have Dabbo and uncle gone?

1261
01:43:03,810 --> 01:43:05,830
Dabbo went to show uncle around Bombay.

1262
01:43:06,620 --> 01:43:08,970
And I went to sleep,
waiting for you.

1263
01:43:10,650 --> 01:43:12,320
I want to ask you something.

1264
01:43:15,920 --> 01:43:18,130
- You have to think and answer me.
- Yes.

1265
01:43:19,380 --> 01:43:20,876
I want to marry you.

1266
01:43:20,900 --> 01:43:22,100
Me too.

1267
01:43:46,180 --> 01:43:49,730
This is a new love

1268
01:43:50,170 --> 01:43:53,510
You are my beloved

1269
01:43:54,100 --> 01:43:57,620
Nobody knows, darling...

1270
01:43:58,060 --> 01:44:01,790
of our story

1271
01:44:02,120 --> 01:44:05,550
This is the time for new love...

1272
01:44:05,940 --> 01:44:09,560
the time for confession

1273
01:44:09,830 --> 01:44:13,270
If there is no world for us...

1274
01:44:13,670 --> 01:44:17,260
we'll create one our own

1275
01:44:17,770 --> 01:44:21,640
This is the atmosphere for new love

1276
01:44:42,730 --> 01:44:50,230
I glanced at you in such a way
that I became very shy

1277
01:44:50,640 --> 01:44:58,020
When your heart called out,
then I came

1278
01:45:14,300 --> 01:45:17,740
Swear on this love...

1279
01:45:18,160 --> 01:45:21,650
on this declaration

1280
01:45:22,060 --> 01:45:25,580
No one knows, darling...

1281
01:45:26,070 --> 01:45:29,680
of our story

1282
01:45:30,010 --> 01:45:33,110
This is the atmosphere for new love

1283
01:45:54,800 --> 01:46:02,300
Say, what you have done
with all your glances?

1284
01:46:02,740 --> 01:46:10,050
Who has filled up my lap with flowers?

1285
01:46:26,530 --> 01:46:29,790
Come, let's walk to a place...

1286
01:46:30,290 --> 01:46:33,730
where the earth and sky embrace

1287
01:46:34,240 --> 01:46:37,700
Where the two worlds meet...

1288
01:46:38,080 --> 01:46:41,620
let's make that our home

1289
01:46:42,120 --> 01:46:45,690
This is a new love

1290
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:49,440
You are my beloved

1291
01:46:49,850 --> 01:46:53,380
Nobody knows, darling...

1292
01:46:53,790 --> 01:46:57,300
of our story

1293
01:46:57,740 --> 01:47:01,190
This is the atmosphere for new love...

1294
01:47:01,620 --> 01:47:05,090
the time for confession

1295
01:47:05,470 --> 01:47:12,840
If there is no world for us,
we'll create our own

1296
01:47:13,330 --> 01:47:17,130
This is a new love

1297
01:47:22,300 --> 01:47:24,060
This isn't possible,
absolutely not possible.

1298
01:47:24,310 --> 01:47:26,650
How is it possible?

1299
01:47:26,700 --> 01:47:27,896
Sukun's right.

1300
01:47:27,920 --> 01:47:30,040
Her mother must be present
for her wedding.

1301
01:47:30,160 --> 01:47:32,000
The presence of her brother
is also important.

1302
01:47:32,080 --> 01:47:34,420
Among elders, it's necessary
for somebody to be present.

1303
01:47:34,490 --> 01:47:36,240
Who is it necessary
to be present?

1304
01:47:36,270 --> 01:47:38,270
It's necessary for one
of the elders to be present.

1305
01:47:38,590 --> 01:47:41,090
Enough, who can be an elderly
person besides me?

1306
01:47:41,560 --> 01:47:42,870
How is that?

1307
01:47:42,940 --> 01:47:44,240
How? Then listen.

1308
01:47:44,780 --> 01:47:47,600
I am Shukal's uncle,
I'm also her brother's uncle.

1309
01:47:47,950 --> 01:47:49,350
I'm Shukal's mother's uncle.

1310
01:47:49,430 --> 01:47:51,480
I'm the uncle
of the whole village.

1311
01:47:51,630 --> 01:47:53,010
- Of the whole village?
- Yes.

1312
01:47:53,390 --> 01:47:56,450
Come on, why the delay?
The wedding will take place right now.

1313
01:47:56,720 --> 01:47:58,720
Roshan, make arrangements
for the wedding.

1314
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,050
I'll explain everything
to the mother and brother.

1315
01:48:01,310 --> 01:48:03,980
I'm an adult and won't
lose such a capable boy.

1316
01:48:04,070 --> 01:48:05,580
Long live uncle!

1317
01:48:06,570 --> 01:48:09,020
You'll become the uncle
of this entire city.

1318
01:48:09,210 --> 01:48:10,870
Now you're my uncle too.

1319
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:47,300
Open the door.

1320
01:48:49,550 --> 01:48:50,650
Police.

1321
01:48:52,630 --> 01:48:53,830
Arrest him.

1322
01:48:57,770 --> 01:48:59,510
- Inspector...
- What has happened?

1323
01:49:00,020 --> 01:49:01,650
- Rita darling...
- Mr. Roshan...

1324
01:49:02,660 --> 01:49:05,720
we arrest you for
robbing the Universal Bank.

1325
01:49:06,300 --> 01:49:07,400
Roshan!

1326
01:49:08,110 --> 01:49:10,510
No, no, Roshan didn't rob
the bank, lnspector.

1327
01:49:10,680 --> 01:49:12,120
Inspector, you've misunderstood.

1328
01:49:12,730 --> 01:49:14,030
We have proof.

1329
01:49:14,950 --> 01:49:16,360
The three thousand rupee notes...

1330
01:49:16,390 --> 01:49:17,790
Roshan brought to Mohans's house...

1331
01:49:18,540 --> 01:49:20,280
were from those 20 lakhs.

1332
01:49:21,110 --> 01:49:24,320
But inspector, I, I didn't rob those notes.

1333
01:49:24,740 --> 01:49:26,140
The court will decide.

1334
01:49:26,690 --> 01:49:27,990
Come with us.

1335
01:49:37,640 --> 01:49:38,840
Rita darling...

1336
01:49:43,130 --> 01:49:45,360
I'm very sad our wedding
is only half complete.

1337
01:49:50,750 --> 01:49:52,350
See this, tickets for a flight.

1338
01:49:53,200 --> 01:49:55,300
I was going to take you
to Kashmir for our honeymoon.

1339
01:49:58,210 --> 01:50:00,370
But my heart's desires
have remained in my heart.

1340
01:50:04,870 --> 01:50:05,970
Inspector...

1341
01:50:14,080 --> 01:50:15,710
Wait, wait.

1342
01:50:18,080 --> 01:50:20,160
Roshan, Roshan.

1343
01:50:32,030 --> 01:50:36,480
Inspector, if you learn
where those 20 lakhs rupees are...

1344
01:50:36,970 --> 01:50:38,410
and who stole them...

1345
01:50:38,970 --> 01:50:40,780
will you then release my Roshan?

1346
01:50:41,310 --> 01:50:42,710
Immediately, this very moment.

1347
01:50:48,530 --> 01:50:51,360
Ustad, this is a very difficult thing.

1348
01:50:51,790 --> 01:50:53,710
It's my business
to change the difficult to easy.

1349
01:50:54,070 --> 01:50:55,530
Any work I take up...

1350
01:50:55,790 --> 01:50:57,390
I never leave it half done.

1351
01:50:57,490 --> 01:50:59,110
All of you be happy, laugh.

1352
01:51:02,760 --> 01:51:03,860
Rita!

1353
01:51:07,860 --> 01:51:10,400
Not Rita, Mrs. Roshan.

1354
01:51:13,120 --> 01:51:14,740
Mrs. Roshan? What's all this?

1355
01:51:15,460 --> 01:51:17,060
What's there to be shocked over?

1356
01:51:18,160 --> 01:51:20,030
A girl married a boy.

1357
01:51:20,760 --> 01:51:23,090
Instead of being shocked,
you should congratulate us.

1358
01:51:23,690 --> 01:51:27,450
Not like this. Give them all a party.

1359
01:51:28,200 --> 01:51:30,620
- We all should get a party.
- You'll have one, surely.

1360
01:51:31,170 --> 01:51:32,270
Congratulations!

1361
01:51:32,700 --> 01:51:34,850
- Thank you.
- Okay.

1362
01:51:41,800 --> 01:51:44,020
There's also the matter of time.

1363
01:51:44,720 --> 01:51:51,160
My girl friend, in front of me,
gets married to someone else.

1364
01:51:51,880 --> 01:51:54,820
And I'll clap my hands in happiness.

1365
01:51:54,980 --> 01:51:58,630
And I'll say once more, once more.

1366
01:52:02,550 --> 01:52:05,730
But the tone can change, too.

1367
01:52:09,420 --> 01:52:16,230
My friends, when I tell you,
you have to kill Roshan.

1368
01:52:16,740 --> 01:52:24,740
And then instead of Roshan,
I will marry Rita.

1369
01:52:27,550 --> 01:52:29,290
You must know the secret way...

1370
01:52:29,360 --> 01:52:31,370
- to Shankar's treasury.
- Yes.

1371
01:52:31,960 --> 01:52:34,050
Listen, please get there
at the right time.

1372
01:52:34,340 --> 01:52:36,810
Don't worry. I'll be there
at the correct time...

1373
01:52:36,840 --> 01:52:40,130
along with my men,
and arrest Shankar and his men.

1374
01:52:40,800 --> 01:52:42,100
Then excuse us.

1375
01:53:06,010 --> 01:53:10,020
How should I come
to your lane, lover?

1376
01:53:23,430 --> 01:53:25,500
The whole house is awake

1377
01:53:25,710 --> 01:53:30,110
The guard is sitting,
guarding the house

1378
01:53:30,210 --> 01:53:34,360
How should I come
to your lane, lover?

1379
01:54:05,860 --> 01:54:10,020
If I become a kite,
I will fly and come

1380
01:54:10,220 --> 01:54:14,710
Then people will cut the string

1381
01:54:19,130 --> 01:54:21,326
This whole world will stop me

1382
01:54:21,350 --> 01:54:23,440
But I will be yours finally

1383
01:54:23,560 --> 01:54:27,760
I will never leave you, lover

1384
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,200
Never leave you

1385
01:54:32,290 --> 01:54:36,440
If you meet me once,
I have a lot to say to you

1386
01:54:36,640 --> 01:54:38,670
Let the guard go to hell

1387
01:54:38,960 --> 01:54:43,010
How should I come
to your lane, lover?

1388
01:55:14,750 --> 01:55:16,880
My eyes are striving

1389
01:55:16,940 --> 01:55:18,980
My eyes are weeping

1390
01:55:19,270 --> 01:55:23,500
I have no control
over this world

1391
01:55:28,010 --> 01:55:32,240
When the cuckoo speaks,
my heart starts pumping

1392
01:55:32,540 --> 01:55:36,560
My heart beats with memories of you

1393
01:55:36,770 --> 01:55:38,940
Burns with your memories

1394
01:55:41,090 --> 01:55:43,110
You come outside once

1395
01:55:43,300 --> 01:55:45,350
With the spring of my heart

1396
01:55:45,530 --> 01:55:47,610
Listen to my heart

1397
01:55:47,830 --> 01:55:52,190
How should I come
to your lane, lover?

1398
01:55:56,560 --> 01:55:58,650
The whole house is awake

1399
01:55:58,910 --> 01:56:03,090
The guard is sitting,
guarding the house

1400
01:56:03,380 --> 01:56:07,810
How should I come
to your lane, lover?

1401
01:56:23,910 --> 01:56:30,260
Mr. Roshan,
let the time pass away.

1402
01:56:34,010 --> 01:56:38,630
Each moment of our life,
is our last moment.

1403
01:56:39,430 --> 01:56:43,120
And each breath is our last breath.

1404
01:56:44,040 --> 01:56:47,580
This night will never return.

1405
01:56:48,220 --> 01:56:53,110
On this happy occasion,
I congratulate you.

1406
01:56:55,810 --> 01:56:58,740
This is also a matter of time.

1407
01:56:59,330 --> 01:57:03,670
My friends, bring in the gift.

1408
01:57:04,390 --> 01:57:08,620
Mr. Roshan, please accept
this present on our behalf.

1409
01:57:09,690 --> 01:57:14,620
My friends have made
this present with a lot of love.

1410
01:57:15,830 --> 01:57:17,030
Come on.

1411
01:57:21,390 --> 01:57:22,990
No, no, Mr. Roshan.

1412
01:57:23,220 --> 01:57:25,180
The cloth will be removed
by your Mrs.

1413
01:57:25,470 --> 01:57:28,420
And you will be stunned.

1414
01:57:28,450 --> 01:57:29,650
What say?

1415
01:57:33,530 --> 01:57:36,040
Why are you just looking? Kill him.

1416
01:57:37,280 --> 01:57:38,580
Get away, Rita.

1417
01:58:30,120 --> 01:58:31,320
Hands up.

1418
01:58:37,510 --> 01:58:38,840
Look at me.

1419
01:58:54,670 --> 01:58:56,510
You've saved your life, enough.

1420
01:58:57,340 --> 01:58:59,610
But it's difficult
to escape from me.

1421
01:59:05,740 --> 01:59:09,070
Now this revolver has
one more bullet remaining.

1422
01:59:09,900 --> 01:59:14,300
If you escape this,
you'll be left alive.

1423
01:59:16,810 --> 01:59:17,910
Ready.

1424
01:59:22,110 --> 01:59:23,210
One.

1425
01:59:27,560 --> 01:59:28,660
Two.

1426
01:59:31,910 --> 01:59:33,010
Three.

1427
01:59:40,610 --> 01:59:41,810
Hands up.

1428
01:59:56,540 --> 01:59:59,200
Mr. Shankar,
we arrest you for gambling...

1429
01:59:59,750 --> 02:00:02,660
and for robbing the Universal Bank.

1430
02:00:03,150 --> 02:00:05,990
The crime of having a gambling
den is okay, lnspector.

1431
02:00:06,920 --> 02:00:10,106
But robbing the Universal Bank,
I don't understand.

1432
02:00:10,130 --> 02:00:14,600
Mr. Shankar, the 20 lakh rupees
you took from the bank...

1433
02:00:15,500 --> 02:00:17,000
give them back to me.

1434
02:00:17,730 --> 02:00:21,410
20 lakh rupees? I fail
to understand anything.

1435
02:00:22,050 --> 02:00:25,400
Shankar, if you still don't
understand anything...

1436
02:00:26,250 --> 02:00:27,850
then I'll explain it to you.

1437
02:00:29,540 --> 02:00:31,120
Now it's no use pretending.

1438
02:00:32,490 --> 02:00:34,190
I told the police everything.

1439
02:00:35,260 --> 02:00:38,840
Okay, so you did all this to me?

1440
02:00:40,490 --> 02:00:43,520
Just as you were going
to kill my Roshan...

1441
02:00:43,550 --> 02:00:45,670
and pin it on me.

1442
02:00:46,250 --> 02:00:48,620
Now I understand everything, lnspector.

1443
02:00:49,160 --> 02:00:50,820
When your own people ditch you...

1444
02:00:50,930 --> 02:00:52,530
then what's the use of hiding?

1445
02:00:52,780 --> 02:00:54,920
Come on, I'll return all the money.

1446
02:00:56,730 --> 02:00:58,030
Thank you, Rita.

1447
02:01:28,460 --> 02:01:34,340
Inspector, those marked boxes
have the money. Remove them.

1448
02:01:35,450 --> 02:01:36,550
Men.

1449
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:45,540
Take those marked boxes out.

1450
02:02:25,050 --> 02:02:26,350
My beloved Roshan...

1451
02:02:27,450 --> 02:02:31,800
whatever a person needs in life,
we got it today.

1452
02:02:33,270 --> 02:02:36,120
You are my lord and
I am your wife.

1453
02:02:37,400 --> 02:02:41,340
Lord and wife? But our wedding
is still to be completed.

1454
02:02:42,340 --> 02:02:44,340
If it's half done,
then we'll complete it.

1455
02:02:46,550 --> 02:02:48,710
I'll wash my lord's feet and drink.

1456
02:02:52,120 --> 02:02:53,520
I'm your slave now.

1457
02:02:54,670 --> 02:02:55,770
Inspector.

1458
02:02:56,460 --> 02:02:57,860
Yes, what's the matter?

1459
02:02:58,720 --> 02:03:00,840
Can a man in Bombay marry twice?

1460
02:03:01,450 --> 02:03:02,650
Two marriages?

1461
02:03:02,760 --> 02:03:04,460
No man or woman can marry twice.

1462
02:03:07,100 --> 02:03:08,700
Are you planning to marry twice?

1463
02:03:09,120 --> 02:03:11,840
I'm not interested, but you're forcing
me to marry for a second time.

1464
02:03:12,870 --> 02:03:15,720
- Second marriage?
- Yes, I'm already married.

1465
02:03:17,110 --> 02:03:18,410
You're already married?

1466
02:03:19,930 --> 02:03:21,130
To whom?

1467
02:03:21,210 --> 02:03:22,510
To Mohan's sister.

1468
02:03:22,820 --> 02:03:24,220
What did you say?

1469
02:03:24,780 --> 02:03:26,080
To Mohan's sister?

1470
02:03:29,280 --> 02:03:31,590
And what was all that
when you were marrying me?

1471
02:03:32,230 --> 02:03:33,730
Just part of the plan.

1472
02:03:37,380 --> 02:03:38,580
A plan?

1473
02:03:39,180 --> 02:03:41,420
In the same way
you played with me...

1474
02:03:41,470 --> 02:03:43,390
to get the 3,000 rupees from me.

1475
02:03:44,840 --> 02:03:48,120
Kamla Devi, in every game
one person wins and another loses.

1476
02:03:49,230 --> 02:03:50,830
But I'm sorry for your defeat.

1477
02:03:57,050 --> 02:03:59,170
As I promised, I've caught everybody.

1478
02:03:59,590 --> 02:04:01,430
Mr. Roshan, we're very pleased with you.

1479
02:04:01,660 --> 02:04:04,700
As we promised,
we'll request the court...

1480
02:04:05,080 --> 02:04:07,890
and we assure you,
all your crimes will be forgiven.

1481
02:04:08,040 --> 02:04:10,210
- Thank you.
- But remember one thing.

1482
02:04:10,520 --> 02:04:12,440
If you pick anybody's pocket after today...

1483
02:04:12,820 --> 02:04:14,720
then it'll be difficult
for us to save you.

1484
02:04:14,990 --> 02:04:17,326
Believe me,
I've given up picking pockets.

1485
02:04:17,350 --> 02:04:18,650
Good, very good.

1486
02:04:18,870 --> 02:04:20,370
- Okay, now excuse me.
- Alright.

1487
02:04:21,210 --> 02:04:22,990
- Okay, inspector.
- All the best,

1488
02:04:24,520 --> 02:04:25,920
Everything is done, Dabbo.

1489
02:04:26,290 --> 02:04:28,410
I'm taking Shukal
now to my house.

1490
02:04:28,970 --> 02:04:30,470
You also come with me.

1491
02:04:30,680 --> 02:04:33,760
It will be worth seeing daughter-in-law
meet mother-in-law for the first time.

1492
02:04:33,850 --> 02:04:35,740
Shukal, Shukal.

1493
02:04:40,640 --> 02:04:42,140
What are you doing here?

1494
02:04:42,380 --> 02:04:44,820
Only what I should be doing.

1495
02:04:47,770 --> 02:04:50,240
- Dabbo, where is Shukal?
- Why ask him? Ask me.

1496
02:04:52,160 --> 02:04:56,470
Mr. Roshan, your wife has left
you and gone to her village.

1497
02:04:57,850 --> 02:04:59,906
Have you told Shukan everything?

1498
02:04:59,930 --> 02:05:01,530
Yes, I told her everything.

1499
02:05:02,780 --> 02:05:04,540
Roshan, that sight was worth seeing.

1500
02:05:05,610 --> 02:05:07,010
When I told Shukan...

1501
02:05:07,380 --> 02:05:09,580
that Roshan was marrying her
not because he loved her...

1502
02:05:10,230 --> 02:05:11,730
but because he pitied her.

1503
02:05:12,850 --> 02:05:14,910
Because he murdered her brother.

1504
02:05:15,990 --> 02:05:18,420
- Her husband is her brother's murderer.
- Rita!

1505
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:20,600
Why are you getting angry, Roshan?

1506
02:05:21,300 --> 02:05:24,090
In every game one person
wins and the other loses.

1507
02:05:25,340 --> 02:05:27,140
But I'm not feeling sorry
for your defeat.

1508
02:05:28,330 --> 02:05:29,530
I'm happy.

1509
02:05:34,390 --> 02:05:36,090
Sir, when's the next
train to Madhaopur?

1510
02:05:36,210 --> 02:05:38,660
The train to Madhaopur
left half an hour ago.

1511
02:05:39,180 --> 02:05:41,750
Half an hour ago?
When's the nerxt train?

1512
02:05:41,890 --> 02:05:43,890
- Tomorrow morning 10:00.
- Tomorrow morning 10:00?

1513
02:05:44,190 --> 02:05:46,420
No train leaves for Madhaopur before 10?

1514
02:05:46,710 --> 02:05:47,810
No.

1515
02:05:51,020 --> 02:05:53,580
'Roshan is marrying you
not because he loves you...

1516
02:05:54,190 --> 02:05:55,890
but because he feels sorry for you.'

1517
02:05:56,430 --> 02:05:59,330
'Because he murdered your brother.'

1518
02:05:59,930 --> 02:06:02,270
'Your husband is your brother's murderer.'

1519
02:06:12,980 --> 02:06:14,080
Shukal.

1520
02:06:16,890 --> 02:06:18,590
Shukal, I'm the one who troubled you.

1521
02:06:19,760 --> 02:06:21,560
You can punish me as you want to.

1522
02:06:23,600 --> 02:06:26,040
Shukal, your brother did
get killed because of me.

1523
02:06:26,670 --> 02:06:28,510
But believe me, whatever happened...

1524
02:06:29,290 --> 02:06:30,590
was an accident.

1525
02:06:34,370 --> 02:06:35,920
Shukal, I was a pickpocket.

1526
02:06:36,550 --> 02:06:38,390
It was my job to pick people's pockets.

1527
02:06:39,060 --> 02:06:41,390
But I didn't know what I was doing...

1528
02:06:41,900 --> 02:06:43,870
might have such serious consequences.

1529
02:06:46,890 --> 02:06:50,496
I look alive to you...

1530
02:06:50,520 --> 02:06:52,420
but inside I'm worse
than a dead body, Shukal.

1531
02:06:52,990 --> 02:06:55,486
Your brother's death has killed me,
even though I'm still alive.

1532
02:06:55,510 --> 02:06:56,910
Please forgive me Shukal.

1533
02:06:57,080 --> 02:06:59,030
- Leave me, leave me.
- Please forgive me.

1534
02:06:59,130 --> 02:07:01,746
- I don't even want to see your face.
- Please forgive me.

1535
02:07:01,770 --> 02:07:02,970
Hey mister.

1536
02:07:04,720 --> 02:07:06,320
Why are you troubling this woman?

1537
02:07:06,750 --> 02:07:08,166
She's my wife, brother.

1538
02:07:08,190 --> 02:07:10,320
He's lying. I'm not his wife.

1539
02:07:10,770 --> 02:07:12,470
I don't know why he's bothering me.

1540
02:07:13,100 --> 02:07:15,020
- Go away from here.
- Go away.

1541
02:07:15,460 --> 02:07:17,360
Or else I'll take you
to the police station.

1542
02:07:23,990 --> 02:07:28,350
I'm going Shukal. Maybe I deserve this.

1543
02:07:32,460 --> 02:07:33,760
Who is it?

1544
02:07:34,100 --> 02:07:36,260
- It is me, mother.
- I am coming, son. Coming.

1545
02:07:45,410 --> 02:07:48,150
God knows when you'll give up
your habit of coming home so late.

1546
02:07:48,940 --> 02:07:51,720
Now, change your clothes.
I'll serve you food.

1547
02:07:52,420 --> 02:07:54,600
No mother, I won't eat food.

1548
02:07:54,750 --> 02:07:56,150
You won't eat food?

1549
02:07:56,990 --> 02:07:58,670
Did you eat somewhere else?

1550
02:07:59,220 --> 02:08:00,720
I didn't eat anywhere, mother.

1551
02:08:01,110 --> 02:08:02,410
I'm not hungry.

1552
02:08:03,190 --> 02:08:04,390
What's happened?

1553
02:08:06,220 --> 02:08:07,820
Why do you look so sad?

1554
02:08:09,270 --> 02:08:11,400
Why do you look
so troubled, son?

1555
02:08:11,690 --> 02:08:17,320
Mother, I'll tell you the reason
for your son's troubles.

1556
02:08:17,680 --> 02:08:21,040
Keep quiet Rita!
If you utter a word I'll kill you.

1557
02:08:21,490 --> 02:08:22,590
Why?

1558
02:08:22,710 --> 02:08:25,030
Have you left me anything
that I should be scared of death?

1559
02:08:25,880 --> 02:08:27,480
Today I'll tell your mother everything.

1560
02:08:28,680 --> 02:08:29,980
Who you are.

1561
02:08:30,510 --> 02:08:33,680
I beg in front of you, please don't
shatter my old mother's dreams.

1562
02:08:34,330 --> 02:08:36,090
When my dreams have
already been shattered...

1563
02:08:36,960 --> 02:08:39,420
I'm not bothered about
anybody else's dreams being destroyed.

1564
02:08:40,800 --> 02:08:45,520
Mother, your son,
whom you consider to be God...

1565
02:08:46,440 --> 02:08:47,640
he's ordinary.

1566
02:08:47,890 --> 02:08:49,090
Roshan, Roshan.

1567
02:08:49,310 --> 02:08:50,660
Roshan. Roshan.

1568
02:08:51,180 --> 02:08:53,080
Leave her. What are you doing?

1569
02:08:53,300 --> 02:08:54,900
- Leave her.
- Have you gone mad?

1570
02:09:05,730 --> 02:09:07,030
What's all this?

1571
02:09:07,330 --> 02:09:09,400
Why are you fighting amongst yourselves?

1572
02:09:09,730 --> 02:09:11,770
Daughter-in-law? I'm not
your daughter-in-law.

1573
02:09:12,190 --> 02:09:15,030
I don't want to be the wife of a man
whose hands are covered with blood.

1574
02:09:15,300 --> 02:09:17,160
- What are you saying?
- I'm absolutely right.

1575
02:09:17,800 --> 02:09:20,390
Because of your son,
so many people don't have food to eat.

1576
02:09:21,100 --> 02:09:23,100
How many children
must have died for want of milk.

1577
02:09:23,670 --> 02:09:25,266
And because of this honest son...

1578
02:09:25,290 --> 02:09:27,260
god knows how many
had to commit suicide.

1579
02:09:27,650 --> 02:09:30,980
Keep quiet. I don't want
to hear anything about my son.

1580
02:09:31,890 --> 02:09:33,190
You've gone mad.

1581
02:09:33,290 --> 02:09:34,590
Yes, I'm mad.

1582
02:09:34,920 --> 02:09:36,730
But your son is a pickpocket.

1583
02:09:37,140 --> 02:09:39,840
He robs others pockets
and fills his stomach.

1584
02:09:39,930 --> 02:09:41,030
Rita!

1585
02:09:41,540 --> 02:09:42,940
Get out of here.

1586
02:09:45,330 --> 02:09:46,830
How dare you come here.

1587
02:10:00,310 --> 02:10:04,750
My son, a pickpocket.

1588
02:10:06,570 --> 02:10:11,180
Son, why did she say
you were a pickpocket?

1589
02:10:12,300 --> 02:10:15,580
You rob other's purses
and fill your mother's stomach.

1590
02:10:22,490 --> 02:10:26,880
Mother, she was very angry.

1591
02:10:29,400 --> 02:10:31,590
Did you refuse to marry her?

1592
02:10:32,780 --> 02:10:34,080
- Yes, mother.
- Okay.

1593
02:10:35,840 --> 02:10:37,610
That's the reason for your fights.

1594
02:10:38,810 --> 02:10:42,290
Son, for a moment
I got very scared.

1595
02:10:43,410 --> 02:10:45,890
How can my son be a pickpocket?

1596
02:10:47,190 --> 02:10:52,390
Whose mother while bringing
him up used to always...

1597
02:10:52,890 --> 02:10:56,860
pray to God to have only
this one support to live.

1598
02:10:57,870 --> 02:11:00,300
He has all the good
values of the world.

1599
02:11:00,980 --> 02:11:02,280
God bless you.

1600
02:11:03,210 --> 02:11:04,710
God bless you my son.

1601
02:11:10,330 --> 02:11:13,210
That mad girl's talk bothered me.

1602
02:11:14,510 --> 02:11:16,240
And I was thinking son.

1603
02:11:17,020 --> 02:11:19,090
How can a mother's milk turn into poison?

1604
02:11:22,120 --> 02:11:23,220
Mother.

1605
02:11:25,100 --> 02:11:26,600
What Rita said is true.

1606
02:11:29,950 --> 02:11:31,350
What did you say?

1607
02:11:35,700 --> 02:11:37,000
I'm a pickpocket.

1608
02:11:38,250 --> 02:11:39,450
A pickpocket?

1609
02:11:41,640 --> 02:11:45,980
You're a pickpocket?

1610
02:11:49,760 --> 02:11:51,460
I've always lied to you.

1611
02:11:56,110 --> 02:11:57,810
I always kept you in the dark.

1612
02:11:59,600 --> 02:12:06,580
I used to thank God
for your earnings.

1613
02:12:08,450 --> 02:12:11,260
That money was stolen money.

1614
02:12:11,880 --> 02:12:13,480
But now I've stopped everything.

1615
02:12:14,620 --> 02:12:17,510
I'll die hungry, but I'll
never do anything wrong.

1616
02:12:19,080 --> 02:12:20,480
Please forgive me mother.

1617
02:12:22,590 --> 02:12:23,990
Please forgive me mother.

1618
02:12:25,550 --> 02:12:26,950
Please forgive me mother.

1619
02:12:28,030 --> 02:12:30,440
Please forgive me mother.

1620
02:12:32,010 --> 02:12:36,730
Forgive me God.

1621
02:12:37,850 --> 02:12:39,850
Forgive me that I gave birth
to such a son.

1622
02:12:42,340 --> 02:12:47,640
Let go of me.
I don't want to live.

1623
02:12:48,940 --> 02:12:50,750
I don't want to see your face.

1624
02:12:52,080 --> 02:12:54,110
Let go of me.

1625
02:12:54,710 --> 02:12:56,110
I want to die.

1626
02:12:58,230 --> 02:12:59,330
Mother!

1627
02:13:01,800 --> 02:13:02,900
Mother!

1628
02:13:45,720 --> 02:13:47,440
'And I was thinking son.

1629
02:13:47,990 --> 02:13:50,310
How can a mother's milk turn into poison?'

1630
02:13:52,970 --> 02:13:59,890
'I used to thank God
for your earnings.'

1631
02:14:01,750 --> 02:14:04,960
'That money was stolen money.'

1632
02:14:08,090 --> 02:14:12,190
Forgive me that I gave
birth to such a son.

1633
02:14:14,840 --> 02:14:19,820
'Let go of me. I don't
want to live.'

1634
02:14:20,370 --> 02:14:21,970
'Leave me, leave me.'

1635
02:14:28,750 --> 02:14:31,440
I swear by you mother.

1636
02:14:32,400 --> 02:14:35,650
I might die of hunger,
but I will never do anything wrong.

1637
02:14:37,770 --> 02:14:39,990
I've always kept you
in the dark mother.

1638
02:14:40,830 --> 02:14:43,930
But now what I'm saying
is not a lie.

1639
02:14:46,140 --> 02:14:50,580
The fire in which you're burning...

1640
02:14:51,370 --> 02:14:56,330
I'll burn my hand in it mother.

1641
02:14:57,480 --> 02:14:59,340
Sir, sir.

1642
02:15:01,100 --> 02:15:04,340
Sir, sir.
