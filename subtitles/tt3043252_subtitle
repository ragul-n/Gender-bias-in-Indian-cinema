1
00:02:13,209 --> 00:02:15,043
Lajjo! Cover your head.

2
00:02:17,709 --> 00:02:19,668
This wind feels wild!

3
00:02:20,251 --> 00:02:22,626
It's touching me everywhere!

4
00:02:24,668 --> 00:02:25,834
<i>Rani?</i>

5
00:02:26,126 --> 00:02:27,876
You want a taste?

6
00:03:01,876 --> 00:03:03,418
She just turned 15.

7
00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:05,626
You won't find a better bride for...

8
00:03:05,793 --> 00:03:06,834
What's his name?

9
00:03:07,001 --> 00:03:07,751
<i>Gulab.</i>

10
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:09,543
<i>Gulab</i> is my only son.

11
00:03:12,084 --> 00:03:13,334
Really, Tulsi...

12
00:03:13,418 --> 00:03:15,043
My worries are over.

13
00:03:15,293 --> 00:03:17,334
I couldn't have found
a more beautiful bride...

14
00:03:17,418 --> 00:03:19,418
If I had looked with a lantern!

15
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:22,709
It's all God's will.

16
00:03:23,126 --> 00:03:24,084
But for me,

17
00:03:24,376 --> 00:03:27,959
God sent one daughter after another.

18
00:03:28,376 --> 00:03:31,834
I have four more to marry off.

19
00:03:32,126 --> 00:03:33,543
One less to worry about.

20
00:03:33,751 --> 00:03:35,543
<i>Janaki</i> is ours now.

21
00:03:36,043 --> 00:03:37,209
Wonderful!

22
00:03:37,501 --> 00:03:40,793
Let us fix a date then.

23
00:03:41,334 --> 00:03:42,584
Just one request...

24
00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:47,543
Could the dowry be raised
from 3 <i>Lakh</i> to...

25
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:49,709
<i>To 4 Lakh?</i>

26
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,626
Gulab, your bride
better have big boobs!

27
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:03,709
Or else get a refund!

28
00:04:04,209 --> 00:04:06,251
I have to make a call.

29
00:04:06,834 --> 00:04:11,584
You'll get it back,
I need to call my Ma.

30
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:14,543
Please eat.

31
00:04:14,876 --> 00:04:16,543
You have a long ride back.

32
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:36,876
ls she any good?

33
00:04:37,793 --> 00:04:39,043
Worth the money?

34
00:04:39,501 --> 00:04:41,459
Did they reduce the dowry?

35
00:04:41,709 --> 00:04:42,876
Later...

36
00:04:43,126 --> 00:04:44,626
I'm still in the meeting.

37
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:50,543
Do your meeting Ma...

38
00:04:51,293 --> 00:04:52,168
But listen...

39
00:04:52,251 --> 00:04:55,293
I'll want a refund if she's rubbish!

40
00:04:57,501 --> 00:05:02,209
What's the matter?

41
00:05:07,126 --> 00:05:10,543
<i>Hello! How is Champa?</i>

42
00:05:11,126 --> 00:05:12,418
l'm begging you...

43
00:05:12,668 --> 00:05:14,418
Leave us alone!

44
00:05:19,251 --> 00:05:21,834
Don't get an educated bride <i>Gulab.</i>

45
00:05:22,168 --> 00:05:23,209
These educated types,

46
00:05:23,459 --> 00:05:26,084
have books riding their minds...

47
00:05:26,293 --> 00:05:29,251
Then what will we ride?

48
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:36,043
You got a problem?

49
00:05:36,918 --> 00:05:37,709
Nah...

50
00:05:38,168 --> 00:05:39,626
Just enjoying the view.

51
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:43,876
Careful or you'll enjoy a beating.

52
00:05:44,084 --> 00:05:44,918
<i>Leave it Kishan.</i>

53
00:05:45,001 --> 00:05:48,126
They're not worth our time.

54
00:05:57,959 --> 00:05:58,876
Witch!

55
00:05:59,334 --> 00:06:01,168
How dare she look us in the eye!

56
00:06:01,834 --> 00:06:05,001
Look at <i>Rani.</i>
She's better than any son.

57
00:06:05,626 --> 00:06:09,043
The way she takes care of
her mother-in-law.

58
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:17,668
Gulab. I said I'm in a meeting.

59
00:06:17,751 --> 00:06:18,626
<i>Gulabo?</i>

60
00:06:19,418 --> 00:06:21,168
Is that your name? Like a Rose?

61
00:06:21,459 --> 00:06:24,126
Does every part of
you smell like roses?

62
00:06:24,459 --> 00:06:25,459
Who is this?

63
00:06:25,543 --> 00:06:29,001
Your lover. Your hero.
Your <i>Shahrukh Khan!</i>

64
00:06:31,251 --> 00:06:32,334
<i>Rani...</i>

65
00:06:33,001 --> 00:06:35,418
That thing looks like trouble.

66
00:06:36,001 --> 00:06:37,334
It's new, <i>Gulab</i> bought it for me.

67
00:06:37,418 --> 00:06:39,793
I'm still learning it.

68
00:06:40,543 --> 00:06:43,501
What an exciting place to keep it!

69
00:06:59,876 --> 00:07:01,668
Ma is saying this now,

70
00:07:02,001 --> 00:07:05,334
but she cursed me every
time I birthed a daughter.

71
00:07:06,709 --> 00:07:10,709
You with your raging hormones.

72
00:07:11,251 --> 00:07:14,126
Couldn't keep your skirt down!

73
00:07:14,584 --> 00:07:19,834
She was a girl-vending machine!

74
00:07:20,501 --> 00:07:23,168
It's the same everywhere Ma.

75
00:07:23,793 --> 00:07:27,376
If men had their way
they'd be pounding us round-the-clock.

76
00:07:28,084 --> 00:07:30,543
Thankfully God created
barren women like me!

77
00:07:31,293 --> 00:07:34,043
Or else the volume of babies produced,

78
00:07:34,126 --> 00:07:36,959
Would fill a whole new nation!

79
00:07:55,793 --> 00:07:57,626
What beautiful eyes.

80
00:08:00,584 --> 00:08:02,668
Such long luscious hair.

81
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:06,293
<i>Gulab</i> won't believe his luck
when he sees you!

82
00:08:09,834 --> 00:08:11,584
<i>Namaste.</i>

83
00:08:26,626 --> 00:08:30,418
Tell me truthfully <i>Lajjo.</i>

84
00:08:32,501 --> 00:08:34,418
My hair is graying-

85
00:08:36,376 --> 00:08:38,418
My eyes are turning weak too.

86
00:08:39,834 --> 00:08:44,293
Last night I didn't recognize
myself in the mirror.

87
00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:47,334
Do I even look like a woman?

88
00:08:48,834 --> 00:08:49,834
Let's see...

89
00:08:54,668 --> 00:08:56,709
Your eyes are so deep...

90
00:08:57,543 --> 00:08:59,543
Like whirlpools to drown in.

91
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,043
Your mouth is like luscious berries

92
00:09:02,126 --> 00:09:04,584
I want to suck the juice from them.

93
00:09:04,876 --> 00:09:06,084
Duffer!

94
00:09:07,084 --> 00:09:09,168
If only you were a man!

95
00:09:09,376 --> 00:09:11,043
Then I'd get under that skirt!

96
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:12,793
Stop!

97
00:09:13,168 --> 00:09:15,001
Tell me something.

98
00:09:15,584 --> 00:09:18,543
Who is this <i>Shahrukh Khan</i>?

99
00:09:18,918 --> 00:09:20,501
ls he a film hero?

100
00:09:20,918 --> 00:09:23,126
<i>Shahrukh Khan?</i>

101
00:09:23,834 --> 00:09:25,001
Not just any hero.

102
00:09:25,418 --> 00:09:26,751
He's the hottest!

103
00:09:27,876 --> 00:09:30,418
Manoj took me to his film once.

104
00:09:30,501 --> 00:09:31,376
Why do you ask?

105
00:09:34,084 --> 00:09:37,251
He called my mobile.
Must have been a mistake.

106
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,209
Let me see!

107
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:46,418
<i>Shahrukh Khan</i> called!
And you didn't tell me?

108
00:09:52,084 --> 00:09:53,834
It has come to our notice...

109
00:09:54,501 --> 00:09:57,459
<i>Champa</i> has run away
from her in-laws' home.

110
00:09:58,293 --> 00:10:02,668
Before trouble starts
between the families...

111
00:10:02,918 --> 00:10:04,209
She must go back.

112
00:10:04,626 --> 00:10:05,668
I won't go back!

113
00:10:05,959 --> 00:10:08,418
My husband doesn't give a damn!

114
00:10:08,876 --> 00:10:10,543
I've come home to my parents'...

115
00:10:11,251 --> 00:10:12,751
How is that wrong?

116
00:10:12,834 --> 00:10:16,959
After marriage,
your parent's home is not yours.

117
00:10:17,418 --> 00:10:20,001
Go home to your husband.

118
00:10:20,918 --> 00:10:23,751
Go back before you
bring shame to our village.

119
00:10:24,168 --> 00:10:25,834
<i>Lakdi</i> manage your daughter.

120
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:28,959
Just like we managed <i>Ganga</i> last year?

121
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:31,334
What happened to her?

122
00:10:31,876 --> 00:10:33,584
She committed suicide.

123
00:10:34,001 --> 00:10:35,959
Times have changed <i>Kheema.</i>

124
00:10:36,209 --> 00:10:37,668
So should we.

125
00:10:38,043 --> 00:10:39,293
Or we'll suffer.

126
00:10:39,376 --> 00:10:40,959
Quiet <i>Kishan!</i>

127
00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:43,209
Don't interfere with the Elders!

128
00:10:43,793 --> 00:10:46,793
You've shamed the village enough...

129
00:10:47,043 --> 00:10:48,793
By bringing in a foreigner bride.

130
00:10:49,293 --> 00:10:52,376
You shamelessly
parade her on your bike!

131
00:10:52,918 --> 00:10:56,668
Keep out of our business!

132
00:10:57,001 --> 00:10:58,876
I'm not some alien from outer space.

133
00:10:59,168 --> 00:11:01,459
My name is <i>Naobi.</i> I'm also an Indian.

134
00:11:01,959 --> 00:11:04,918
My husband drives me to the bus stop,

135
00:11:05,001 --> 00:11:08,001
So I can teach the children
in the next village.

136
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,459
What is shameful about that?

137
00:11:10,751 --> 00:11:13,043
Do not flaunt your education here!

138
00:11:14,168 --> 00:11:17,209
We also educate our kids!

139
00:11:17,334 --> 00:11:19,418
<i>As for you Champa...</i>

140
00:11:19,959 --> 00:11:23,126
This village is as much
mine as it is yours!

141
00:11:26,293 --> 00:11:29,793
Society has rules for a reason.

142
00:11:30,293 --> 00:11:32,418
Don't question the Elders!

143
00:11:32,626 --> 00:11:34,209
We won't survive
without their support!

144
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:35,959
Their support can go to hell!

145
00:11:46,501 --> 00:11:47,834
Okay... Calm down.

146
00:11:48,126 --> 00:11:49,126
Moving on.

147
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:50,751
<i>Devi...</i>

148
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:54,459
Head of the village women,
has something to say.

149
00:11:54,918 --> 00:11:55,876
<i>Namaste.</i>

150
00:11:56,334 --> 00:11:59,293
The women have a request...

151
00:11:59,584 --> 00:12:02,959
The trucking contracts
keep our men away for weeks.

152
00:12:03,418 --> 00:12:06,668
While we women are trapped
inside our homes.

153
00:12:07,251 --> 00:12:10,876
We are the last village without TV.

154
00:12:11,793 --> 00:12:15,418
TV would entertain the men too.

155
00:12:15,793 --> 00:12:18,501
Then they wouldn't need to
visit the Dance Company...

156
00:12:20,584 --> 00:12:23,918
We already regret giving
into your last demand.

157
00:12:24,334 --> 00:12:26,418
You demanded mobile phones,

158
00:12:26,709 --> 00:12:29,626
To keep track of your husbands.

159
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:31,709
We relented.

160
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:33,043
But what happened?

161
00:12:33,251 --> 00:12:38,001
Shivers daughter eloped with
a man she met on the mobile.

162
00:12:38,668 --> 00:12:39,793
In the next village...

163
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:43,918
Girls who watched TV
started wearing jeans pant.

164
00:12:47,168 --> 00:12:49,084
Hear this brothers...

165
00:12:49,251 --> 00:12:50,376
Next thing we know...

166
00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:52,668
These women will be
driving our trucks too!

167
00:12:56,251 --> 00:12:59,459
Then there's the matter of money.

168
00:12:59,876 --> 00:13:01,793
A TV dish is expensive.

169
00:13:01,876 --> 00:13:03,334
<i>Kishan</i> has negotiated...

170
00:13:03,418 --> 00:13:06,001
A large order for our handicrafts.

171
00:13:06,501 --> 00:13:09,043
We will get paid before
the Dussehra festival.

172
00:13:09,668 --> 00:13:13,584
We women will pool our earnings,

173
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:15,209
And buy a TV for the village.

174
00:13:15,709 --> 00:13:19,209
First get the money. Then we'll see.

175
00:13:19,543 --> 00:13:20,959
And with that...

176
00:13:21,168 --> 00:13:23,834
This meeting comes to a close.

177
00:13:24,501 --> 00:13:25,709
<i>Hail Lord Ram!</i>

178
00:13:26,418 --> 00:13:28,126
<i>Hail</i> Lord <i>Krishna!</i>

179
00:13:34,376 --> 00:13:38,126
Ma! Don't send me back!

180
00:13:38,209 --> 00:13:41,543
You should be grateful.

181
00:13:41,834 --> 00:13:46,543
Your in-laws
have agreed to take you back!

182
00:13:46,834 --> 00:13:47,668
They have forgiven you!

183
00:13:47,751 --> 00:13:49,209
Forgiven? What for?

184
00:13:49,293 --> 00:13:51,293
My husband doesn't
even touch me.

185
00:13:51,668 --> 00:13:53,501
He has a mistress
in the next village.

186
00:13:53,584 --> 00:13:54,959
Quiet, <i>Champa!</i>

187
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:59,168
You have shamed us enough!

188
00:13:59,251 --> 00:14:03,084
I take responsibility for her!

189
00:14:03,168 --> 00:14:04,668
<i>Kishan and Naobi</i> will employ me.

190
00:14:04,751 --> 00:14:06,543
<i>You stay out of this Kishan!</i>

191
00:14:06,626 --> 00:14:08,543
How dare you speak for her!

192
00:14:12,793 --> 00:14:16,418
My brother-in-law
forces himself on me!

193
00:14:16,876 --> 00:14:19,626
All the men in the house don't
miss an opportunity to fuck me.

194
00:14:20,876 --> 00:14:23,209
Even my father-in-law!

195
00:14:25,084 --> 00:14:27,751
Can you bear to hear more?

196
00:14:28,626 --> 00:14:32,001
I had to abort a child because
I didn't know who the father was!

197
00:14:35,418 --> 00:14:38,126
Ma... they will kill me!

198
00:14:40,209 --> 00:14:42,959
Don't send me to that hell!

199
00:14:44,793 --> 00:14:46,209
She'll come around.

200
00:14:46,668 --> 00:14:47,668
All will be well.

201
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:03,168
I look like a clown!

202
00:15:03,501 --> 00:15:04,918
Like a Prince!

203
00:15:05,209 --> 00:15:07,001
Such a beautiful face.

204
00:15:07,168 --> 00:15:09,668
Eyes just like your father's.

205
00:15:10,043 --> 00:15:11,751
I'm not a girl!

206
00:15:12,251 --> 00:15:15,251
Beautiful? Grandma tell her...

207
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:20,668
Have you seen <i>Kishan's</i> wife?

208
00:15:21,168 --> 00:15:23,251
Brazenly rides the bus alone!

209
00:15:23,334 --> 00:15:25,168
Exposes her midriff to the world!

210
00:15:25,376 --> 00:15:26,543
That is <i>Kishan's</i> business.

211
00:15:26,626 --> 00:15:28,751
All his education drivel
is corrupting our village.

212
00:15:28,834 --> 00:15:30,334
You stay out of it.

213
00:15:30,709 --> 00:15:33,709
You know as a child,
I loved reading books too.

214
00:15:34,376 --> 00:15:37,334
But my mother said,

215
00:15:38,584 --> 00:15:41,668
Girls who read make bad wives.

216
00:15:42,376 --> 00:15:44,918
So, she married me off at 14.

217
00:15:45,251 --> 00:15:48,418
You're trapping me the same way!

218
00:15:49,043 --> 00:15:51,626
And why did you build this wall?

219
00:15:53,751 --> 00:15:55,793
Oh... You'll see...

220
00:15:55,876 --> 00:15:58,084
After your wedding!

221
00:15:58,709 --> 00:16:00,834
Now listen,
don't take on a new contract.

222
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:02,334
I need you at home.

223
00:16:02,418 --> 00:16:06,918
No way! It's my last
days of bachelorhood.

224
00:16:08,084 --> 00:16:09,584
I'll call you from the mobile.

225
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:10,793
I won't answer.

226
00:16:11,376 --> 00:16:12,751
See you in a few days.

227
00:16:13,918 --> 00:16:15,459
Take care Grandma.

228
00:16:18,793 --> 00:16:19,709
Ma...

229
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:22,334
Our boy is becoming a man.

230
00:16:23,084 --> 00:16:24,376
<i>Lajjo!</i>

231
00:16:24,668 --> 00:16:27,293
ls the wedding order ready?

232
00:16:27,876 --> 00:16:29,543
It's due in 2 days!

233
00:16:29,626 --> 00:16:33,793
Just one blouse left.

234
00:16:35,084 --> 00:16:37,959
I tried some new designs,
From that magazine you gave me.

235
00:16:38,209 --> 00:16:39,418
Yes...

236
00:16:43,376 --> 00:16:46,209
<i>Naobi, meet Rani and Lajjo...</i>

237
00:16:46,293 --> 00:16:48,751
Very important members
of my craft team.

238
00:16:49,084 --> 00:16:51,376
And this is <i>Naobi.</i> My new bride.

239
00:16:51,584 --> 00:16:52,709
She is college educated.

240
00:16:52,751 --> 00:16:55,959
Speaks English fluently.

241
00:16:56,209 --> 00:16:59,043
She negotiated our new contract.

242
00:16:59,126 --> 00:17:01,376
Soon our business will boom.

243
00:17:01,459 --> 00:17:03,418
You're so beautiful!

244
00:17:05,334 --> 00:17:07,293
Such soft skin!

245
00:17:08,126 --> 00:17:11,418
Fair like a foreigner.

246
00:17:12,084 --> 00:17:14,043
<i>Kishan</i> you have a good eye.

247
00:17:14,709 --> 00:17:16,126
Let's meet tomorrow.

248
00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:18,168
I'll arrange the advance till then.

249
00:17:27,793 --> 00:17:33,043
I've heard foreign women bathe
in milk. That's why they glow.

250
00:17:33,126 --> 00:17:34,168
Duffer!

251
00:17:34,251 --> 00:17:38,376
Only one thing makes a woman glow...

252
00:17:38,834 --> 00:17:41,209
Not milk, soap or cream.

253
00:17:41,543 --> 00:17:43,168
In Bl]'/I's words...

254
00:17:43,251 --> 00:17:45,668
It's called sex!

255
00:17:45,751 --> 00:17:47,751
That's why you and I look so sad!

256
00:17:48,043 --> 00:17:49,001
What's the date today?

257
00:17:49,084 --> 00:17:51,459
I heard the dance company is here.

258
00:17:51,751 --> 00:17:53,376
Let's go to see <i>Bijli</i> tonight!

259
00:17:55,501 --> 00:17:59,251
<i>Bijli</i>... The Earthquake-maker!!!

260
00:17:59,543 --> 00:18:03,501
The Dance Company is back!

261
00:18:04,543 --> 00:18:07,876
Once again in your village!

262
00:18:08,626 --> 00:18:10,626
A night of lust and passion...

263
00:18:10,709 --> 00:18:12,459
With the queen! <i>Bijli!</i>

264
00:18:12,668 --> 00:18:15,709
First show tonight at 8!

265
00:18:17,209 --> 00:18:20,709
<i>Pull out your wallets,
the Earthquake-maker is here!</i>

266
00:18:22,793 --> 00:18:26,126
<i>Shake it my prince...</i>

267
00:18:26,209 --> 00:18:29,751
<i>Shake it Inspector...</i>

268
00:18:33,418 --> 00:18:36,418
<i>Sit back, relax Inspector...
you're off duty now!</i>

269
00:18:36,918 --> 00:18:40,209
<i>Shake it my Prince...</i>

270
00:18:40,293 --> 00:18:43,251
<i>Shake it Inspector...</i>

271
00:18:43,334 --> 00:18:46,918
<i>I will shake down your courtiers...</i>

272
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:50,293
<i>Turn their squirrels to snakes...</i>

273
00:18:50,501 --> 00:18:53,959
<i>I will break your pride...</i>

274
00:18:54,001 --> 00:18:57,293
<i>I will disrupt your peace!</i>

275
00:18:57,543 --> 00:19:02,251
<i>I will zap your brains...</i>

276
00:19:04,459 --> 00:19:06,126
<i>I will make...</i>

277
00:19:06,209 --> 00:19:07,876
<i>I will make...</i>

278
00:19:07,959 --> 00:19:11,209
<i>I will make your earth shake...</i>

279
00:19:11,584 --> 00:19:14,793
<i>I will make your earth shake...</i>

280
00:19:15,043 --> 00:19:18,543
<i>I will make an earthquake in your bed.</i>

281
00:19:18,626 --> 00:19:21,876
<i>Yes, an earthquake in your bed.</i>

282
00:19:23,793 --> 00:19:25,334
She agreed to sex you up for 500.

283
00:19:25,626 --> 00:19:27,084
You have an hour.

284
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:32,084
Go get deflowered!

285
00:19:32,168 --> 00:19:34,793
Make your father proud!

286
00:19:35,501 --> 00:19:37,959
I hope your shooter works.

287
00:19:38,209 --> 00:19:40,418
Like an AK-47!

288
00:20:04,584 --> 00:20:07,793
<i>When I stretch like this...</i>

289
00:20:08,084 --> 00:20:11,418
<i>Even the morning gets shy...</i>

290
00:20:11,626 --> 00:20:15,043
<i>When my anklets ring...</i>

291
00:20:15,126 --> 00:20:18,001
<i>The earth comes alive...</i>

292
00:20:18,084 --> 00:20:19,459
<i>I'm an angel...</i>

293
00:20:19,543 --> 00:20:20,334
<i>A witch...</i>

294
00:20:20,418 --> 00:20:21,209
<i>A babe...</i>

295
00:20:21,293 --> 00:20:22,209
<i>A bitch...</i>

296
00:20:22,293 --> 00:20:23,834
<i>No innocent flower.</i>

297
00:20:23,918 --> 00:20:25,251
<i>Go ahead deflower!</i>

298
00:20:37,459 --> 00:20:40,876
<i>She will make the earth shake.</i>

299
00:20:40,918 --> 00:20:44,376
<i>She will make the earth shake.</i>

300
00:20:44,418 --> 00:20:48,251
<i>She will bring an
earthquake in the bed.</i>

301
00:20:50,834 --> 00:20:52,501
Look <i>Bijli...</i>

302
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:54,584
We don't turn away clients.

303
00:20:55,084 --> 00:20:57,626
Make your money while
they still want you.

304
00:20:58,459 --> 00:20:59,418
My heart's not in it.

305
00:20:59,501 --> 00:21:00,543
Get it?

306
00:21:01,043 --> 00:21:04,626
Life's more than just money and sex.

307
00:21:05,209 --> 00:21:07,834
And don't start about
bringing on a new girl.

308
00:21:07,918 --> 00:21:10,126
Or I'll run off to Mumbai!

309
00:21:10,418 --> 00:21:13,793
Aha! Marilyn Monroe
and her stardom dreams...

310
00:21:13,876 --> 00:21:16,251
I've been hearing this for 3 years.

311
00:21:17,043 --> 00:21:19,709
Listen... I'm like your father.

312
00:21:20,251 --> 00:21:21,668
So I'll tell you the truth.

313
00:21:21,959 --> 00:21:24,709
You are a whore.

314
00:21:24,793 --> 00:21:25,834
And will always be a whore.

315
00:21:26,376 --> 00:21:27,959
So shut up and go earn!

316
00:21:28,251 --> 00:21:30,334
In that case daddy dearest...

317
00:21:30,584 --> 00:21:32,834
I have a request.

318
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:36,543
My body is a little wrung out today...

319
00:21:38,376 --> 00:21:41,168
Tell your client
to come another night.

320
00:21:41,251 --> 00:21:43,376
This shop is closed!

321
00:21:48,334 --> 00:21:49,709
Here is your bottle.

322
00:21:52,709 --> 00:21:55,251
I am glad you refused that client.

323
00:21:55,543 --> 00:21:56,501
Why?

324
00:21:56,584 --> 00:21:59,001
Thought you'd get lucky tonight?

325
00:22:02,043 --> 00:22:03,084
<i>Bijli...</i>

326
00:22:04,209 --> 00:22:06,084
Please shut your
tent securely at night.

327
00:22:06,293 --> 00:22:08,918
When I came to wake you today,
your skirt...

328
00:22:09,001 --> 00:22:11,126
Why is it you always wake me?

329
00:22:11,584 --> 00:22:13,709
Does the boss pay you extra for it?

330
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:18,043
You'd prefer someone else?

331
00:22:18,793 --> 00:22:20,418
I wish!

332
00:22:21,168 --> 00:22:23,126
But just my luck...

333
00:22:23,459 --> 00:22:27,334
You are my only cuckoo clock.

334
00:22:27,418 --> 00:22:29,501
<i>Bijli...</i> You're back!

335
00:22:29,584 --> 00:22:33,501
<i>Lajjo!</i> It's been ages!

336
00:22:34,043 --> 00:22:35,251
Hello!

337
00:22:35,543 --> 00:22:37,043
Goodbye!

338
00:22:37,876 --> 00:22:39,584
Yeah... I'm going.

339
00:22:40,751 --> 00:22:42,418
<i>Hey Rani...</i>

340
00:22:45,084 --> 00:22:48,834
So I said to the boss...

341
00:22:49,168 --> 00:22:51,959
No way. Go to hell!

342
00:22:52,459 --> 00:22:55,293
From now on...
<i>Bijli</i> opens only for love.

343
00:22:56,501 --> 00:22:58,959
You want to give up your life
and become like us?

344
00:23:00,543 --> 00:23:01,626
She's lost it!

345
00:23:01,709 --> 00:23:03,626
Can't she see how
boring and sad we are?

346
00:23:04,126 --> 00:23:05,751
Come here... I have a secret.

347
00:23:06,043 --> 00:23:08,251
I met a man in the last village.

348
00:23:08,584 --> 00:23:10,834
He taught me to dream.

349
00:23:11,209 --> 00:23:14,084
Rocked me to the
moon and back all night.

350
00:23:14,334 --> 00:23:17,543
In the morning he said...

351
00:23:17,834 --> 00:23:21,084
<i>Hey <i>Bijju</i>... dream away.</i>

352
00:23:21,293 --> 00:23:23,001
Your whole life is ahead of you.

353
00:23:24,376 --> 00:23:26,001
What a man!

354
00:23:27,001 --> 00:23:29,543
I'm still burning up.

355
00:23:29,793 --> 00:23:32,376
Those long dancing fingers...

356
00:23:33,001 --> 00:23:35,168
Soft tickling moustache.

357
00:23:35,709 --> 00:23:36,626
Hang on!

358
00:23:37,168 --> 00:23:39,459
Should I imagine fingers or moustache?

359
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:41,001
You choose.

360
00:23:42,418 --> 00:23:45,584
He stroked me the whole night...

361
00:23:45,959 --> 00:23:48,834
Pressed all the right buttons.

362
00:23:49,793 --> 00:23:53,084
I went straight to heaven!

363
00:23:54,501 --> 00:23:56,376
And then he aroused me...

364
00:23:56,459 --> 00:23:58,334
With his words!

365
00:23:58,918 --> 00:24:02,251
I doubt I've ever spoken
so much in my life!

366
00:24:04,043 --> 00:24:05,668
Did you tell <i>Bijli</i>?

367
00:24:10,876 --> 00:24:12,043
No?

368
00:24:12,334 --> 00:24:14,334
<i>Gulab's date is fixed!</i>

369
00:24:15,043 --> 00:24:16,459
We found him a bride!

370
00:24:16,501 --> 00:24:18,001
Wedding is on the 9th.

371
00:24:24,834 --> 00:24:26,251
Her blouse was so tight...

372
00:24:26,751 --> 00:24:29,501
No wonder men fall at her feet!

373
00:24:29,584 --> 00:24:33,584
I think <i>Bijli</i> makes up these stories.

374
00:24:33,834 --> 00:24:38,959
I have never heard of a man
talking during the act!

375
00:24:41,001 --> 00:24:41,793
Hello?

376
00:24:41,959 --> 00:24:43,209
<i>Gulabo</i>, why are you panting?

377
00:24:43,293 --> 00:24:44,584
I am out of breath.

378
00:24:44,793 --> 00:24:46,501
What are you up to?

379
00:24:46,793 --> 00:24:48,793
I'm walking. What's it to you?

380
00:24:49,084 --> 00:24:50,959
I think I'm falling in love.

381
00:24:51,501 --> 00:24:53,501
Do you feel the flutter too?

382
00:24:53,668 --> 00:24:54,876
No!

383
00:24:54,959 --> 00:24:56,709
Will you be my Valentine?

384
00:24:57,043 --> 00:24:58,043
What?

385
00:25:00,709 --> 00:25:02,293
Valentine?

386
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:04,251
Valentine day?

387
00:25:06,001 --> 00:25:07,501
It's a day for naughty love.

388
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:08,918
I've got to go!

389
00:25:12,543 --> 00:25:14,001
That was <i>Shahrukh Khan.</i>

390
00:25:14,084 --> 00:25:16,168
First call was by mistake.

391
00:25:16,334 --> 00:25:19,251
Now he calls all the time.

392
00:25:19,334 --> 00:25:21,459
Says naughty things.

393
00:25:21,543 --> 00:25:24,459
He calls me <i>Gulabo...</i> His rose.

394
00:25:24,543 --> 00:25:27,001
He's outrageous!

395
00:25:27,376 --> 00:25:29,293
You're blushing.

396
00:25:36,334 --> 00:25:39,043
Maybe I should tell him the truth?

397
00:25:39,626 --> 00:25:41,001
About the real me?

398
00:25:41,918 --> 00:25:43,918
ls this all wrong <i>Lajjo?</i>

399
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:47,251
Why wrong?

400
00:25:58,334 --> 00:26:01,251
Ma, remember when I'd spilled water...

401
00:26:01,334 --> 00:26:03,626
And you slipped on it?

402
00:26:03,709 --> 00:26:06,918
I'd burst out laughing.
I was so young!

403
00:26:07,543 --> 00:26:10,751
What a beating you gave me that day.

404
00:26:11,043 --> 00:26:12,959
Your son <i>Shankar</i>;
had to save me.

405
00:26:13,918 --> 00:26:16,084
But who could save me from <i>Shankar?</i>

406
00:26:16,793 --> 00:26:18,834
When he started staying
out all night...

407
00:26:18,918 --> 00:26:19,876
You said...

408
00:26:20,168 --> 00:26:22,543
All will be well.

409
00:26:23,001 --> 00:26:25,876
When he kept that mistress...

410
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:28,584
Again you said... "All will be well."

411
00:26:33,834 --> 00:26:36,001
When <i>Shankar</i> died in that accident...

412
00:26:37,001 --> 00:26:38,834
First you cursed me...

413
00:26:40,126 --> 00:26:42,209
And then said... "All will be well."

414
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:47,293
But nothing changed.

415
00:26:49,918 --> 00:26:51,959
Years passed... <i>Gulab</i> grew up.

416
00:26:53,793 --> 00:26:55,168
And l...

417
00:26:57,959 --> 00:27:01,584
Once <i>Gulab's</i> bride gets here...

418
00:27:01,668 --> 00:27:06,376
It'll be my turn to lie on a cot...
and all will be well.

419
00:27:16,959 --> 00:27:18,584
What you doing <i>Lajjo?</i>

420
00:27:21,251 --> 00:27:23,209
Going for a competition?

421
00:27:25,293 --> 00:27:27,293
No... I have a delivery tomorrow.

422
00:27:27,459 --> 00:27:28,418
What?

423
00:27:29,001 --> 00:27:30,168
A delivery.

424
00:27:33,043 --> 00:27:34,959
What do you know about "delivery"?

425
00:27:35,626 --> 00:27:38,501
You, with your infertile womb.

426
00:27:44,376 --> 00:27:47,168
Booze has drowned
all the love inside you.

427
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:52,251
No... no... no... no!

428
00:27:53,001 --> 00:27:54,876
What did you say bitch?

429
00:27:55,126 --> 00:27:57,418
If I hadn't spent so much on you.

430
00:27:57,501 --> 00:27:59,209
I'd have trashed you long ago!

431
00:28:00,376 --> 00:28:01,918
I'm not your whore!

432
00:28:04,293 --> 00:28:05,209
What?

433
00:28:06,251 --> 00:28:07,459
I'm not your whore.

434
00:28:08,501 --> 00:28:09,751
Barren bitch!

435
00:28:11,209 --> 00:28:12,668
Don't! Please!

436
00:28:22,001 --> 00:28:26,084
The donkey chose water over booze.

437
00:28:28,376 --> 00:28:30,334
So the moral of the story is...

438
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:33,709
A man who doesn't booze is an Ass!

439
00:28:33,793 --> 00:28:35,001
Right <i>Gulab?</i>

440
00:28:35,459 --> 00:28:37,668
Man up! Have a drink!

441
00:28:56,668 --> 00:28:59,543
When is your date with God oldie?

442
00:28:59,793 --> 00:29:02,334
Marry me? What say?

443
00:29:03,584 --> 00:29:06,459
He's so sweet in public,
such a monster at home.

444
00:29:09,126 --> 00:29:12,084
Last night he was so drunk.

445
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:14,626
He said to me...

446
00:29:15,334 --> 00:29:18,334
No matter how deep I drill...
You remain a barren desert.

447
00:30:05,418 --> 00:30:07,293
Why is she crying so much?

448
00:30:08,043 --> 00:30:10,293
Has she found out...

449
00:30:10,793 --> 00:30:12,709
About your tiny willy?

450
00:30:18,793 --> 00:30:20,626
<i>Rani</i> need to show you something.

451
00:30:27,918 --> 00:30:29,293
What's this?

452
00:30:29,626 --> 00:30:31,626
Her hair was infested with lice.

453
00:30:31,793 --> 00:30:36,376
There was no other way.

454
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:40,126
I asked her father to postpone...

455
00:30:40,376 --> 00:30:42,001
But he refused.
Said that the money's been taken.

456
00:30:42,043 --> 00:30:44,001
ls this what I paid for?

457
00:30:44,293 --> 00:30:46,626
I'll lose face in my community!

458
00:30:47,168 --> 00:30:52,334
For the sake of both our families,
please take her.

459
00:30:52,543 --> 00:30:54,876
I apologize on behalf
of my entire family.

460
00:30:55,543 --> 00:30:58,418
Please take her <i>Rani...</i> Please.

461
00:31:14,959 --> 00:31:18,001
<i>Our precious daughter.</i>

462
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:21,001
<i>Beautiful as a flower.</i>

463
00:31:21,084 --> 00:31:26,376
<i>She doesn't know
how much she is loved.</i>

464
00:31:36,043 --> 00:31:42,168
<i>Goodbye darling,
you leave us with a heavy heart!</i>

465
00:31:53,959 --> 00:31:56,751
<i>The animals and birds will miss you...</i>

466
00:31:56,834 --> 00:31:59,709
<i>Trees and plants will go dry...</i>

467
00:31:59,793 --> 00:32:05,001
<i>You are the center of our Universe...</i>

468
00:32:17,209 --> 00:32:19,959
<i>Our precious daughter.</i>

469
00:32:20,043 --> 00:32:22,668
<i>Beautiful as a flower.</i>

470
00:32:28,418 --> 00:32:31,084
<i>Our precious daughter.</i>

471
00:32:31,168 --> 00:32:36,168
<i>God Himself watches over you.</i>

472
00:32:36,251 --> 00:32:38,876
<i>Because you are God's favorite too.</i>

473
00:33:09,584 --> 00:33:11,418
<i>Namaste.</i>

474
00:33:16,626 --> 00:33:18,751
Congratulations <i>Gulab!</i>

475
00:33:20,043 --> 00:33:21,918
A small gift for the bride.

476
00:33:22,168 --> 00:33:23,709
When you finish reading these.
I'll give you more.

477
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:25,876
I live just two lanes away.

478
00:33:28,668 --> 00:33:32,751
Your bride will be smarter
than you <i>Gulab!</i>

479
00:33:33,293 --> 00:33:35,209
She'll make more money too!

480
00:33:46,626 --> 00:33:49,126
Put out the candles,
the Earthquake cometh!

481
00:33:51,084 --> 00:33:52,876
It's the Queen of the Dance Company!

482
00:33:52,959 --> 00:33:54,251
She has some guts coming here!

483
00:33:54,334 --> 00:33:57,834
She is Ran/is friend from childhood.

484
00:34:07,168 --> 00:34:08,293
<i>Rani!</i>

485
00:34:08,626 --> 00:34:10,126
Congratulations!

486
00:34:10,459 --> 00:34:12,334
Many many congratulations!!

487
00:34:18,418 --> 00:34:20,001
Oh I know...

488
00:34:20,959 --> 00:34:22,584
I've come a bit early.

489
00:34:23,168 --> 00:34:24,418
Huh?

490
00:34:25,209 --> 00:34:28,001
I should have waited
till everyone left.

491
00:34:29,293 --> 00:34:31,959
But I was too excited!

492
00:34:33,668 --> 00:34:37,001
And look! I even forgot <i>Gulab's</i> gift!

493
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:48,043
<i>OK...</i>

494
00:34:48,334 --> 00:34:49,584
I'll leave.

495
00:34:51,084 --> 00:34:53,626
Don't want to spoil
this night for you.

496
00:35:06,168 --> 00:35:08,126
Everything is ruined Ma.

497
00:35:08,918 --> 00:35:11,584
<i>Gulab</i> won't even look at me.

498
00:35:12,584 --> 00:35:15,418
He thinks I did it on purpose.

499
00:35:18,334 --> 00:35:21,251
I thought I'd finally
rest easy tonight.

500
00:35:22,334 --> 00:35:24,168
But everything is ruined.

501
00:35:25,376 --> 00:35:27,793
Here, take a sip.

502
00:35:30,751 --> 00:35:31,668
Ma?

503
00:35:46,918 --> 00:35:48,168
<i>Gulab!</i>

504
00:36:24,959 --> 00:36:26,626
My mother said...

505
00:36:27,126 --> 00:36:31,668
She died of shock
from seeing your bald bride.

506
00:36:33,376 --> 00:36:35,959
Rani spent a
fortune on your joke-bride.

507
00:36:37,293 --> 00:36:39,543
The oldie died laughing.

508
00:36:58,334 --> 00:36:59,959
Where have you been
for the last <i>2</i> days?

509
00:37:07,043 --> 00:37:08,751
Are you drunk again?

510
00:37:22,043 --> 00:37:23,418
What's your name?

511
00:37:23,793 --> 00:37:25,459
<i>Janaki.</i>

512
00:37:26,918 --> 00:37:28,334
<i>Janaki.</i>

513
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:34,584
Take this off.

514
00:37:35,876 --> 00:37:37,126
Why?

515
00:37:39,459 --> 00:37:41,001
What are you doing?

516
00:37:44,084 --> 00:37:45,459
Lie down.

517
00:37:47,376 --> 00:37:48,668
Come here.

518
00:37:49,668 --> 00:37:50,543
Don't do that!

519
00:37:50,626 --> 00:37:51,626
Shhh...

520
00:37:52,209 --> 00:37:53,584
Please!

521
00:38:17,543 --> 00:38:18,709
<i>Bijli?</i>

522
00:38:21,668 --> 00:38:22,876
One second...

523
00:38:25,584 --> 00:38:26,543
<i>Rani?</i>

524
00:38:26,626 --> 00:38:28,834
It's late!

525
00:38:31,876 --> 00:38:33,168
Come in!

526
00:38:34,001 --> 00:38:35,293
What's wrong?

527
00:38:36,543 --> 00:38:37,459
<i>Rani?</i>

528
00:38:38,584 --> 00:38:39,793
<i>Bijli.</i>

529
00:38:39,876 --> 00:38:42,001
Forgive me for the other night.

530
00:38:42,543 --> 00:38:44,459
Are you crazy <i>Rani?</i>

531
00:38:45,001 --> 00:38:46,334
It was my fault!

532
00:38:46,418 --> 00:38:49,001
I shouldn't have come.

533
00:38:49,418 --> 00:38:51,543
I was just so excited!

534
00:38:52,668 --> 00:38:54,793
Look. You're sorry. I'm sorry.

535
00:38:54,876 --> 00:38:56,709
Our sorrys cancel out!

536
00:38:59,043 --> 00:39:01,251
Tell me about the wedding.

537
00:39:01,876 --> 00:39:03,959
How is the groom?

538
00:39:05,418 --> 00:39:07,418
It's <i>Gulab's</i> wedding night.

539
00:39:09,043 --> 00:39:11,376
I forced him to marry her.

540
00:39:14,709 --> 00:39:16,751
I have ruined his life!

541
00:39:16,834 --> 00:39:19,918
N o , <i>Rani!</i>

542
00:39:20,334 --> 00:39:24,043
Just watch! In no time...

543
00:39:24,126 --> 00:39:27,584
<i>Janaki</i> will have him
wrapped around her finger.

544
00:39:27,751 --> 00:39:29,709
It's not a big deal!

545
00:39:29,793 --> 00:39:34,168
It's just hair!

546
00:39:36,459 --> 00:39:37,834
<i>Bijli.</i>

547
00:39:39,084 --> 00:39:40,834
How is your hair so beautiful?

548
00:39:41,918 --> 00:39:43,459
Always so perfect?

549
00:39:45,293 --> 00:39:47,084
You're so fair...

550
00:39:49,626 --> 00:39:53,709
But you are the dark horse...

551
00:39:54,626 --> 00:39:58,418
With a wild streak!

552
00:40:01,959 --> 00:40:03,126
<i>Bijli?</i>

553
00:40:05,334 --> 00:40:06,209
<i>Bijli!</i>

554
00:40:07,376 --> 00:40:08,334
Yes?

555
00:40:10,959 --> 00:40:12,418
The boss sent your share.

556
00:40:13,209 --> 00:40:15,168
He said a big client
is coming tomorrow.

557
00:40:15,584 --> 00:40:16,584
<i>OK.</i>

558
00:40:18,418 --> 00:40:20,084
What is it <i>Raju?</i>

559
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:22,668
ls there someone with you?

560
00:40:22,876 --> 00:40:26,709
You can play detective tomorrow.

561
00:40:26,793 --> 00:40:28,251
Now good night!

562
00:40:32,126 --> 00:40:33,876
Darling...

563
00:40:34,501 --> 00:40:36,543
Sweet dreams...

564
00:40:44,334 --> 00:40:46,418
Sweetest dreams to you too <i>Bijli.</i>

565
00:40:53,459 --> 00:40:55,293
You're going to work <i>Gulab?</i>

566
00:40:55,834 --> 00:40:59,126
Such long luscious hair <i>Gulab...</i>

567
00:40:59,668 --> 00:41:01,209
You'll be stunned by her beauty!

568
00:41:01,793 --> 00:41:03,293
There, I'm stunned.

569
00:41:04,793 --> 00:41:06,084
Worry not Mother,

570
00:41:06,959 --> 00:41:08,543
I've performed my husbandly duties.

571
00:41:18,168 --> 00:41:20,084
Finally... The Princess wakes.

572
00:41:20,459 --> 00:41:22,543
This isn't your mother's house.

573
00:41:24,126 --> 00:41:25,334
There.

574
00:41:46,876 --> 00:41:48,251
Chop this.

575
00:41:49,543 --> 00:41:51,084
Do some work.

576
00:41:53,084 --> 00:41:54,334
Cover your head.

577
00:41:54,418 --> 00:41:57,793
You've shamed me enough already.

578
00:42:01,334 --> 00:42:03,251
Not on the floor!

579
00:42:08,709 --> 00:42:10,834
Didn't your mother teach you anything?

580
00:42:13,709 --> 00:42:15,834
They sold me a useless goat.

581
00:42:20,376 --> 00:42:22,793
I squashed her boobs...

582
00:42:23,334 --> 00:42:24,834
Then I slammed into her!

583
00:42:25,043 --> 00:42:28,084
Showed her who's the boss!

584
00:42:28,834 --> 00:42:31,209
Lucky bastard, getting double action.

585
00:42:31,293 --> 00:42:33,918
Got a bride and a whore.

586
00:42:36,584 --> 00:42:37,626
<i>Gulab!</i>

587
00:42:37,709 --> 00:42:40,334
Stop! That's <i>Kishan's</i> stuff!

588
00:42:40,418 --> 00:42:42,709
Bastard! That skirt-fucker!

589
00:42:42,793 --> 00:42:45,834
Challenges the village Elders!

590
00:42:45,918 --> 00:42:48,209
Sisterfucker!

591
00:42:48,834 --> 00:42:50,918
That motherfucker.

592
00:42:51,001 --> 00:42:52,751
Piss on his handicrafts!

593
00:42:52,834 --> 00:42:54,709
What will he sell now?

594
00:42:54,793 --> 00:42:57,668
Hey... grab a stack!

595
00:42:59,668 --> 00:43:01,084
Dick!

596
00:43:01,168 --> 00:43:02,626
Corrupting our women...

597
00:43:02,709 --> 00:43:04,376
Let's show him!

598
00:43:06,876 --> 00:43:08,793
Stop asshole!

599
00:43:08,876 --> 00:43:10,626
My Ma stitched that!

600
00:43:10,709 --> 00:43:12,626
Fucked

601
00:43:14,043 --> 00:43:15,459
Run!

602
00:43:16,168 --> 00:43:17,626
What's going on?

603
00:43:18,209 --> 00:43:19,418
Fuck you <i>Kishan!</i>

604
00:43:19,501 --> 00:43:20,626
<i>Gulab?</i>

605
00:43:32,668 --> 00:43:34,459
Where have you been?

606
00:43:34,543 --> 00:43:36,876
I came by your house... it was locked.

607
00:43:54,043 --> 00:43:55,126
What happened?

608
00:45:34,334 --> 00:45:35,709
<i>Shahrukh Khan?</i>

609
00:46:46,084 --> 00:46:47,209
Ma?

610
00:46:51,876 --> 00:46:55,751
Ma the dough is ready.
Should I fire the stove?

611
00:46:56,043 --> 00:46:57,168
Yes.

612
00:47:08,001 --> 00:47:09,626
What happened?

613
00:47:10,418 --> 00:47:12,293
Who did this?

614
00:47:12,793 --> 00:47:14,168
<i>Forget</i> it <i>Rani.</i>

615
00:47:14,334 --> 00:47:16,418
Some people don't like progress.

616
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:19,209
But we will not back down.

617
00:47:19,293 --> 00:47:21,584
We'll continue our work quietly.

618
00:47:22,584 --> 00:47:25,334
Why is everyone in this village
deaf and mute?

619
00:47:25,626 --> 00:47:28,084
Why don't you tell her the truth?

620
00:47:28,584 --> 00:47:30,084
<i>Gulab</i> has gone mad!

621
00:47:30,168 --> 00:47:31,793
Look what he did!

622
00:47:32,751 --> 00:47:34,334
Control your son!

623
00:47:37,084 --> 00:47:41,959
Twinkle Twinkle Little Star

624
00:47:42,293 --> 00:47:43,668
How I wonder-

625
00:47:43,876 --> 00:47:46,209
Get inside! Now!

626
00:47:47,251 --> 00:47:49,376
Haven't you been told?

627
00:47:49,751 --> 00:47:51,626
Girls who read make bad wives!

628
00:47:52,209 --> 00:47:53,876
Learn to please your husband!

629
00:47:53,959 --> 00:47:56,834
Or he'll dump you and never look back!

630
00:48:15,751 --> 00:48:16,418
Hello?

631
00:48:17,334 --> 00:48:18,584
Not <i>Gulabo!</i> My name is <i>Rani.</i>

632
00:48:18,668 --> 00:48:20,043
<i>Rani Kan war Jaiswal!</i>

633
00:48:20,126 --> 00:48:23,834
A 32 year old widow,
with a 17 year old son.

634
00:48:25,001 --> 00:48:28,334
My eyes are getting weak!
My back hurts!

635
00:48:28,418 --> 00:48:29,584
Want to hear more?

636
00:48:30,126 --> 00:48:32,584
It's been 15 years since
I've been touched by a man.

637
00:48:33,834 --> 00:48:35,459
Tell me <i>Shahrukh Khan...</i>

638
00:48:35,834 --> 00:48:37,501
Where and when do you want to meet?

639
00:48:51,418 --> 00:48:52,334
And then...

640
00:48:52,418 --> 00:48:54,418
His pants tore open...

641
00:48:55,209 --> 00:48:57,168
To unleash his dragon.

642
00:48:57,376 --> 00:48:59,918
But as soon as his dragon got out...

643
00:49:00,793 --> 00:49:03,251
It shrunk into a mouse.

644
00:49:05,543 --> 00:49:07,709
What is this <i>Bijli?</i>

645
00:49:07,876 --> 00:49:09,584
How long can we sit like this?

646
00:49:09,751 --> 00:49:11,918
Its mud from the ocean floor...

647
00:49:12,126 --> 00:49:17,251
It will make you look 16 again.

648
00:49:17,334 --> 00:49:20,334
No mud can bring back my lost years.

649
00:49:20,834 --> 00:49:23,001
What's with the mood <i>Rani?</i>

650
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:26,668
Did you fight with your mobile lover?

651
00:49:27,084 --> 00:49:27,793
<i>Shahrukh Khan.</i>

652
00:49:27,876 --> 00:49:29,376
Oh! <i>Shahrukh Khan!</i>

653
00:49:29,751 --> 00:49:31,751
Don't frown!

654
00:49:31,834 --> 00:49:33,293
You'll get wrinkles!

655
00:49:33,543 --> 00:49:35,126
Then he won't call you!

656
00:49:35,209 --> 00:49:37,459
No phone. No tring tring.

657
00:49:37,543 --> 00:49:41,209
He won't be calling again.

658
00:49:41,668 --> 00:49:43,168
Ever!

659
00:49:43,251 --> 00:49:45,251
I don't need wrinkles to put him off.

660
00:49:45,834 --> 00:49:47,918
I told him the truth about me.

661
00:49:48,334 --> 00:49:51,001
Off he ran! Tail between his legs.

662
00:50:01,626 --> 00:50:02,793
<i>Lajjo!</i>

663
00:50:03,751 --> 00:50:05,501
Don't keep roaming around!

664
00:50:06,376 --> 00:50:08,418
Go fix me a meal. I'm starving.

665
00:50:11,543 --> 00:50:12,959
You better go.

666
00:50:16,876 --> 00:50:18,876
You'll get the money.

667
00:50:20,334 --> 00:50:21,834
I assure you.

668
00:50:22,584 --> 00:50:24,001
Look... There's his mother.

669
00:50:26,418 --> 00:50:27,834
<i>Gulab</i> is in trouble.

670
00:50:27,876 --> 00:50:29,084
He owes them money.

671
00:50:29,168 --> 00:50:30,418
Pa)! Up now!

672
00:50:58,543 --> 00:51:01,209
I need time to arrange for the rest.

673
00:51:01,959 --> 00:51:04,001
Sir. Could we get an advance?

674
00:51:04,793 --> 00:51:05,959
It's an emergency.

675
00:51:06,418 --> 00:51:08,043
Yes. We'll deliver on time.

676
00:51:08,251 --> 00:51:12,709
I sold my wedding necklace.
I'm still 5000 short.

677
00:51:12,959 --> 00:51:15,876
Don't worry. We'll get the money.

678
00:51:18,501 --> 00:51:19,709
It's done!

679
00:51:38,918 --> 00:51:40,084
Mother dear...

680
00:51:40,293 --> 00:51:41,543
You brought my money?

681
00:51:43,126 --> 00:51:44,376
Where is it?

682
00:51:45,126 --> 00:51:46,918
He owes me for more than a month now!

683
00:51:47,459 --> 00:51:48,959
I run a business after all!

684
00:51:52,793 --> 00:51:54,543
Little motherfucker!

685
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:56,709
Don't have a dime in your pocket!

686
00:51:56,918 --> 00:51:57,959
Calling mommy to save you?

687
00:51:58,043 --> 00:51:59,459
You want free sex?

688
00:51:59,543 --> 00:52:01,293
Get it from your wife!

689
00:52:05,376 --> 00:52:07,084
Bloody dogs in heat!

690
00:52:07,168 --> 00:52:09,501
Always looking for a quick fuck!

691
00:52:40,084 --> 00:52:41,043
<i>Janaki!</i>

692
00:53:04,543 --> 00:53:05,709
<i>Rani?</i>

693
00:53:08,251 --> 00:53:13,459
Ma's not home. She's gone to the city.

694
00:54:40,918 --> 00:54:43,626
You have completely disgraced us!

695
00:54:44,793 --> 00:54:46,501
I was already in
debt from your wedding!

696
00:54:46,584 --> 00:54:49,043
And now this!

697
00:54:49,126 --> 00:54:50,293
It's your fault!

698
00:54:50,543 --> 00:54:52,584
I didn't even want to get married!

699
00:54:53,251 --> 00:54:55,709
Send her back and get a refund.

700
00:54:56,043 --> 00:54:57,626
Anyway she's bloody defective.

701
00:54:57,709 --> 00:54:59,626
You'll trade your wife
for booze and whores?

702
00:54:59,709 --> 00:55:01,751
It's only money, okay!

703
00:55:42,543 --> 00:55:43,584
Light yourself another.

704
00:55:43,918 --> 00:55:45,043
Where is everyone?

705
00:55:45,834 --> 00:55:47,543
Boss has gone to the Village Elders.

706
00:55:47,626 --> 00:55:49,126
To plead our case.

707
00:55:49,459 --> 00:55:50,501
Why?

708
00:55:50,751 --> 00:55:52,668
The village women are asking for a TV.

709
00:55:53,084 --> 00:55:54,793
If that happens <i>Bijli</i>,

710
00:55:54,876 --> 00:55:56,501
we'll be out of business.

711
00:55:56,751 --> 00:55:58,334
What bullshit!

712
00:55:59,293 --> 00:56:03,793
TV can't replace <i>Bijli's</i> thunder.

713
00:56:08,501 --> 00:56:09,501
No <i>Bijli</i>

714
00:56:09,584 --> 00:56:10,918
Yes <i>Raju!</i>

715
00:56:12,418 --> 00:56:13,376
<i>Bijli</i> No!

716
00:56:13,459 --> 00:56:14,459
<i>Raju</i> Yes!

717
00:56:14,543 --> 00:56:15,543
C'mon, <i>Lajjo.</i>

718
00:56:17,793 --> 00:56:19,418
Can anyone stop you <i>Bijli</i>?

719
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:21,209
No!

720
00:56:21,918 --> 00:56:23,084
<i>Then gm!</i>

721
00:56:26,668 --> 00:56:28,543
Move your stupid sheep!

722
00:56:41,043 --> 00:56:42,209
<i>Rani!</i>

723
00:56:44,168 --> 00:56:45,668
You two look like monkeys!

724
00:56:45,751 --> 00:56:47,418
Hey Elephant Queen!

725
00:56:47,501 --> 00:56:49,668
Ride with us to the zoo!

726
00:56:49,751 --> 00:56:50,668
Come on!

727
00:56:50,751 --> 00:56:52,709
I'll die before I'm seen on that!

728
00:56:52,918 --> 00:56:54,376
You're both insane!

729
00:56:54,918 --> 00:56:56,918
Forget what others say...

730
00:56:57,001 --> 00:57:00,793
Follow your heart <i>Rani!</i>

731
00:57:01,043 --> 00:57:04,293
<i>Bijli's</i> craziness is infectious!

732
00:57:04,376 --> 00:57:05,793
Come be crazy with us!

733
00:57:07,834 --> 00:57:09,293
What will people say?

734
00:57:09,584 --> 00:57:12,501
They'll say "Rani's having fun!"

735
00:57:13,959 --> 00:57:17,293
Hurry or everyone will see!

736
00:58:00,709 --> 00:58:02,709
Jana/dis really an innocent.

737
00:58:03,334 --> 00:58:05,626
May she remain so forever.

738
00:58:05,959 --> 00:58:08,334
Don't nag her to have children soon.

739
00:58:09,376 --> 00:58:11,751
But she must bear children!

740
00:58:12,459 --> 00:58:13,793
Without bearing a child...

741
00:58:13,876 --> 00:58:16,501
A woman's life is nothing!

742
00:58:18,459 --> 00:58:19,709
<i>Rani!</i>

743
00:58:20,168 --> 00:58:22,793
You talk such shit sometimes.

744
00:58:22,959 --> 00:58:27,584
A woman has value,
even without a child.

745
00:58:27,668 --> 00:58:30,251
We weren't born just to bear children!

746
00:58:32,376 --> 00:58:33,959
<i>Lajjo...</i>

747
00:58:34,626 --> 00:58:36,043
Don't worry.

748
00:58:36,293 --> 00:58:38,668
You can't give up.

749
00:58:39,834 --> 00:58:41,459
Life can't be that unfair.

750
00:58:42,251 --> 00:58:43,959
We have just one life.

751
00:58:44,501 --> 00:58:46,501
We too will find
our share of happiness.

752
00:58:46,584 --> 00:58:47,876
Have faith.

753
00:58:48,834 --> 00:58:50,209
Wait a minute!

754
00:58:50,584 --> 00:58:52,376
Maybe he's the problem!

755
00:58:53,126 --> 00:58:53,501
Huh?

756
00:58:53,584 --> 00:58:55,418
Tell <i>Manoj</i> to get himself tested.

757
00:58:56,293 --> 00:58:57,126
What?

758
00:58:57,209 --> 00:58:58,293
What do you mean?

759
00:58:58,459 --> 00:59:02,418
Men can be infertile too!

760
00:59:02,501 --> 00:59:04,918
It's not always a woman's fault.

761
00:59:05,668 --> 00:59:07,584
Get <i>Manoj</i> tested.

762
00:59:07,793 --> 00:59:11,293
Let's see who's barren. Him or you?

763
00:59:11,376 --> 00:59:12,918
Are you saying?

764
00:59:14,043 --> 00:59:16,668
That I could be a mother someday?

765
00:59:17,959 --> 00:59:19,293
Men can be infertile?

766
00:59:19,376 --> 00:59:20,251
Absolutely!

767
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:23,251
I didn't know that was possible!

768
00:59:23,876 --> 00:59:25,459
How can we test this?

769
00:59:25,626 --> 00:59:28,626
<i>Bijli</i>, do you have a magic potion?

770
00:59:28,918 --> 00:59:29,793
Or...

771
00:59:30,168 --> 00:59:32,793
A doctor, a priest or a healer?

772
00:59:32,876 --> 00:59:36,626
Those frauds can't get you a baby.

773
00:59:37,084 --> 00:59:38,418
Let me think.

774
00:59:38,501 --> 00:59:40,168
I'll figure something.

775
00:59:41,084 --> 00:59:42,876
But first you tell me...

776
00:59:43,543 --> 00:59:45,668
Why do you want a child so badly?

777
00:59:46,376 --> 00:59:48,459
To save your marriage?

778
00:59:49,251 --> 00:59:50,959
What kind of a question is that <i>Bijli?</i>

779
00:59:51,334 --> 00:59:54,126
I want the joy of having a child!

780
00:59:55,293 --> 00:59:57,793
<i>Manoj</i> can beat me all he wants,

781
00:59:57,876 --> 01:00:00,334
but I won't be beaten by fate.

782
01:00:00,751 --> 01:00:04,334
If I can have a child,

783
01:00:04,418 --> 01:00:06,084
I want one.

784
01:00:07,959 --> 01:00:09,543
That motherfucker...

785
01:00:10,959 --> 01:00:13,251
He's hurt you so much.

786
01:00:14,334 --> 01:00:15,876
Motherfucker.

787
01:00:16,709 --> 01:00:18,626
Who invented these cuss words?

788
01:00:18,709 --> 01:00:20,584
I bet it was man.

789
01:00:21,084 --> 01:00:24,001
Why is a woman getting
fucked in every cuss?

790
01:00:24,084 --> 01:00:25,876
Motherfucker! Sisterfucker!

791
01:00:26,293 --> 01:00:28,793
It's time the men got fucked!

792
01:00:33,834 --> 01:00:35,126
Sonfucker!

793
01:00:35,376 --> 01:00:36,209
<i>Bijli!</i>

794
01:00:36,501 --> 01:00:37,501
Sonfucker!

795
01:00:37,918 --> 01:00:40,168
Unclefucker! Fatherfucker!

796
01:00:40,251 --> 01:00:42,126
Brotherfucker!

797
01:00:42,459 --> 01:00:43,668
<i>Shout it out Rani!</i>

798
01:00:43,959 --> 01:00:45,043
Shout it!

799
01:00:45,126 --> 01:00:48,168
Fatherfucker! Sonfucker!

800
01:00:48,251 --> 01:00:49,834
Sonfucker!

801
01:00:49,918 --> 01:00:51,418
Brotherfucker!!!

802
01:01:02,209 --> 01:01:04,001
What's happening to <i>Rani?</i>

803
01:01:09,834 --> 01:01:11,626
You're sitting on <i>Shahrukh Khan!</i>

804
01:01:11,709 --> 01:01:13,251
See what I mean?

805
01:01:13,334 --> 01:01:14,834
Who needs men...

806
01:01:14,918 --> 01:01:17,668
When a mobile can get us off!

807
01:01:22,543 --> 01:01:25,459
This will free us from men!

808
01:01:25,543 --> 01:01:27,293
Hail the mobile!

809
01:01:27,376 --> 01:01:30,293
Hail the vibrating signal provider!

810
01:01:31,126 --> 01:01:32,584
It's stopped vibrating!

811
01:01:32,668 --> 01:01:34,793
Wait it's happening again!

812
01:01:37,293 --> 01:01:39,168
Hey... It's <i>Gulab.</i>

813
01:01:39,709 --> 01:01:40,834
Hello?

814
01:01:41,418 --> 01:01:42,626
I'm out.

815
01:01:43,001 --> 01:01:44,834
<i>Janaki</i> is with me.

816
01:01:45,918 --> 01:01:46,918
What?

817
01:01:47,001 --> 01:01:49,168
Fix your own dinner.

818
01:01:49,251 --> 01:01:51,209
We'll be home late.

819
01:01:51,543 --> 01:01:52,709
That's right.

820
01:01:54,543 --> 01:01:55,876
Was that <i>Gulab?</i>

821
01:01:57,459 --> 01:01:58,376
<i>Rani...</i>

822
01:01:59,918 --> 01:02:02,876
He's getting out of hand.
You need to control him.

823
01:02:09,918 --> 01:02:11,168
<i>Janaki.</i>

824
01:02:11,584 --> 01:02:13,543
Go wait by the bike.

825
01:02:14,126 --> 01:02:15,668
We're leaving soon.

826
01:02:16,334 --> 01:02:17,376
Go.

827
01:02:21,876 --> 01:02:23,751
It's good you sent her away.

828
01:02:26,084 --> 01:02:26,918
<i>Gulab</i> has gone mad...

829
01:02:27,001 --> 01:02:28,043
Forget about <i>Gulab!</i>

830
01:02:28,668 --> 01:02:30,168
Worry about yourself.

831
01:02:31,168 --> 01:02:33,168
The village women have
complained to the Elders...

832
01:02:33,709 --> 01:02:35,668
That you lure their husbands.

833
01:02:36,668 --> 01:02:38,501
The Elders called your boss.

834
01:02:40,043 --> 01:02:41,043
Right?

835
01:02:41,584 --> 01:02:44,251
They're going to shut down your tent.

836
01:02:46,209 --> 01:02:47,501
Aah!

837
01:02:49,043 --> 01:02:50,459
I get it.

838
01:02:51,668 --> 01:02:54,334
Their husbands come
to me of their own free will...

839
01:02:54,418 --> 01:02:55,459
And that's my fault?

840
01:02:56,209 --> 01:02:58,084
<i>Gulab</i> goes to a whore...

841
01:02:58,168 --> 01:03:00,959
That whore in the city!

842
01:03:01,043 --> 01:03:02,584
And that's my fault?

843
01:03:02,918 --> 01:03:04,043
And <i>Lajjo!</i>

844
01:03:04,334 --> 01:03:06,459
Your husband stays
out drunk all night.

845
01:03:06,543 --> 01:03:08,126
That must be my fault too!

846
01:03:08,418 --> 01:03:10,543
I have corrupted your saintly men!

847
01:03:11,459 --> 01:03:13,126
You didn't have to
sell your wedding necklace...

848
01:03:13,209 --> 01:03:15,209
To save your child from pimps!

849
01:03:15,293 --> 01:03:17,126
It is easy for you to talk!

850
01:03:18,001 --> 01:03:20,543
Truth is...
you have never lived our lives!

851
01:03:21,418 --> 01:03:24,501
Try managing a home,
family, and children.

852
01:03:24,584 --> 01:03:26,668
It's not child's play!

853
01:03:28,584 --> 01:03:30,584
<i>Gulab isn't a child anymore Rani!</i>

854
01:03:30,793 --> 01:03:33,251
He came to my tent,
with a bundle of cash...

855
01:03:38,834 --> 01:03:40,251
Whore!

856
01:03:48,751 --> 01:03:50,084
<i>Janaki...</i>

857
01:03:50,584 --> 01:03:51,959
Wait.

858
01:03:58,251 --> 01:04:00,793
I slapped <i>Gulab</i> just as hard!

859
01:04:00,959 --> 01:04:02,584
Told him to get lost!

860
01:04:08,626 --> 01:04:11,709
I was there when <i>Gulab</i> was born.

861
01:04:12,126 --> 01:04:14,334
I saw him before <i>Rani</i> did.

862
01:04:16,626 --> 01:04:20,501
Truth is...
I am not from Ran/is village.

863
01:04:20,584 --> 01:04:22,751
Nor are we childhood friends.

864
01:04:24,709 --> 01:04:26,709
I first met her years ago.

865
01:04:27,376 --> 01:04:30,793
When I dropped
her very drunk husband home.

866
01:04:34,334 --> 01:04:36,126
<i>Shankar</i> was my client.

867
01:04:39,459 --> 01:04:44,126
She was a new bride. Barely 14 or 15.

868
01:04:46,709 --> 01:04:48,584
Just a child.

869
01:04:49,793 --> 01:04:51,584
She thanked me for bringing him home.

870
01:04:52,001 --> 01:04:54,001
Even made me stay for dinner.

871
01:04:55,834 --> 01:04:57,626
I was a child too.

872
01:04:58,043 --> 01:04:59,834
A child with no friends.

873
01:05:00,459 --> 01:05:02,834
We sat up talking till dawn...

874
01:05:03,876 --> 01:05:05,918
I'll never forget that night.

875
01:05:09,084 --> 01:05:11,209
Next year when I returned...

876
01:05:12,209 --> 01:05:14,626
I heard that <i>Shankar</i> had died
in an accident.

877
01:05:16,751 --> 01:05:18,293
Year after year...

878
01:05:18,626 --> 01:05:21,793
I made sure I came back to see <i>Rani.</i>

879
01:05:23,793 --> 01:05:26,584
Today there is nobody in my life...

880
01:05:28,209 --> 01:05:30,709
More dear to me than <i>Rani.</i>

881
01:05:33,959 --> 01:05:37,001
There they are!

882
01:05:39,459 --> 01:05:42,376
<i>Rani...</i> Wait!

883
01:05:44,626 --> 01:05:46,834
<i>Rani...</i> Don't be stubborn.

884
01:05:53,543 --> 01:05:55,293
Where were you all day?

885
01:05:57,084 --> 01:05:59,043
Answer me!

886
01:06:00,459 --> 01:06:02,293
I haven't eaten all day!

887
01:06:03,709 --> 01:06:05,376
You were with <i>Bijli</i>, right?

888
01:06:05,709 --> 01:06:07,501
I'm warning you!

889
01:06:08,126 --> 01:06:11,418
Stop meeting that dirty whore!

890
01:06:11,501 --> 01:06:14,543
You can visit that "dirty whore".

891
01:06:15,251 --> 01:06:16,834
But not me?

892
01:06:18,126 --> 01:06:20,251
Open your booze-addled eyes <i>Gulab.</i>

893
01:06:20,668 --> 01:06:22,876
And look at your wife for once.

894
01:06:23,751 --> 01:06:25,084
Don't hurry to be a man...

895
01:06:25,376 --> 01:06:27,251
Learn to be human first.

896
01:06:47,834 --> 01:06:48,751
<i>Bijli?</i>

897
01:06:48,918 --> 01:06:50,293
Oh. Sorry.

898
01:06:50,376 --> 01:06:51,293
Hey <i>Raju...</i>

899
01:06:51,918 --> 01:06:53,001
Who's taken my stage?

900
01:06:53,584 --> 01:06:54,376
No one.

901
01:06:54,876 --> 01:06:56,293
Tell me! Who's on my stage?

902
01:06:57,043 --> 01:06:59,168
Tell me!

903
01:06:59,459 --> 01:07:01,876
<i>Bijlii.</i> The boss is furious!

904
01:07:01,959 --> 01:07:03,376
You took off without a word.

905
01:07:03,459 --> 01:07:05,751
And you keep refusing clients!

906
01:07:07,418 --> 01:07:09,168
He said he'd fire me...

907
01:07:09,501 --> 01:07:10,876
For letting you take the bike.

908
01:07:10,959 --> 01:07:14,459
He said "Gas doesn't come for free!"

909
01:07:14,543 --> 01:07:16,251
Don't spin yarns.

910
01:07:16,834 --> 01:07:18,709
Just tell me who's on my stage?

911
01:07:18,793 --> 01:07:20,543
She's nothing!

912
01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:22,126
Just a filler...

913
01:07:22,709 --> 01:07:26,293
While the crowds wait for you.

914
01:07:30,876 --> 01:07:32,168
How do I look?

915
01:07:36,459 --> 01:07:39,334
Nobody compares to you <i>Bijli.</i>

916
01:07:40,334 --> 01:07:41,876
Go. Work it.

917
01:07:42,376 --> 01:07:44,251
Go make the earth quake!

918
01:07:44,834 --> 01:07:46,084
Go!

919
01:08:02,834 --> 01:08:04,543
Please stop!

920
01:08:04,626 --> 01:08:07,043
Let me shut that mouth of yours!

921
01:08:17,918 --> 01:08:19,959
I want no part in <i>Bijli's</i> crazy plan.

922
01:08:20,043 --> 01:08:22,001
It's such a huge risk.

923
01:08:22,501 --> 01:08:23,959
What if someone finds out?

924
01:08:24,709 --> 01:08:26,834
What if your husband finds out?

925
01:08:26,918 --> 01:08:28,251
How will he?

926
01:08:29,168 --> 01:08:31,001
He'll never find out!

927
01:08:31,501 --> 01:08:32,334
Of course he will.

928
01:08:32,418 --> 01:08:33,834
We won't let him.

929
01:08:35,043 --> 01:08:38,418
These marks of love
he leaves on my body...

930
01:08:40,626 --> 01:08:42,001
Should I ignore them?

931
01:08:42,751 --> 01:08:44,626
Accept this as my fate?

932
01:08:46,293 --> 01:08:49,918
Just imagine, what if I'm not barren?

933
01:08:54,793 --> 01:08:56,084
Remember what you said?

934
01:08:56,459 --> 01:08:57,959
Life can't be that unfair...

935
01:08:58,918 --> 01:09:01,168
We too will find
our share of happiness.

936
01:09:02,959 --> 01:09:05,293
I want my share <i>Rani.</i>

937
01:09:26,668 --> 01:09:27,751
<i>Bijli?</i>

938
01:09:28,751 --> 01:09:29,834
Here?

939
01:09:30,626 --> 01:09:31,834
Yes. Here.

940
01:09:32,168 --> 01:09:34,084
Right in the middle of the road.

941
01:09:34,626 --> 01:09:35,876
Duffer chick!

942
01:09:36,168 --> 01:09:39,043
There's a cave behind that hill.

943
01:09:39,293 --> 01:09:41,626
That's where you're going.

944
01:09:45,543 --> 01:09:47,959
Hey <i>Rani...</i> I'll be back soon.

945
01:10:01,334 --> 01:10:02,418
Hello?

946
01:10:03,168 --> 01:10:05,084
<i>Rani Kanwar Jaiswal?</i>

947
01:10:06,543 --> 01:10:07,709
Who is this?

948
01:10:08,793 --> 01:10:10,709
I'm still <i>Shahrukh Khan.</i>

949
01:10:11,418 --> 01:10:12,834
But not the film hero.

950
01:10:13,126 --> 01:10:16,334
Just a 42 year old bachelor
called <i>Shahrukh Khan.</i>

951
01:10:17,084 --> 01:10:18,668
I have a hearty laugh...

952
01:10:18,959 --> 01:10:20,376
And a long mustache.

953
01:10:20,668 --> 01:10:21,918
You want to hear more?

954
01:10:22,668 --> 01:10:26,084
My eyes are sharp but
my joints ache in the winter.

955
01:10:27,334 --> 01:10:29,334
Tell me <i>Rani.</i> Will you meet me?

956
01:10:30,376 --> 01:10:32,584
And please don't say...
"What will people say?"

957
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:38,584
But what will people say?

958
01:10:45,626 --> 01:10:48,751
Hey. You're sure you want this?

959
01:10:49,168 --> 01:10:50,168
According to my calculations...

960
01:10:50,209 --> 01:10:53,626
This is the right time of the month
for you to conceive.

961
01:10:54,126 --> 01:10:56,084
Yes. I'm sure <i>Bijlii.</i>

962
01:10:58,043 --> 01:11:00,376
Remember the lover I told you about?

963
01:11:01,418 --> 01:11:03,168
The one who taught me to dream?

964
01:11:03,251 --> 01:11:04,543
He's the one!

965
01:11:18,626 --> 01:11:20,001
<i>Lajjo...</i>

966
01:11:20,959 --> 01:11:22,709
Don't be afraid.

967
01:11:23,418 --> 01:11:26,376
Go make your village proud!

968
01:14:50,584 --> 01:14:52,209
You know <i>Raju?</i>

969
01:14:53,043 --> 01:14:55,459
I think he's falling in love with me.

970
01:14:55,709 --> 01:14:57,043
Your <i>Raju?</i>

971
01:14:57,876 --> 01:15:00,834
I've noticed how he looks at you.

972
01:15:01,084 --> 01:15:04,293
Everybody falls in
love with our <i>Bijli!</i>

973
01:15:06,793 --> 01:15:08,251
Oh sonfuckers!

974
01:15:08,959 --> 01:15:10,418
It's dawn.

975
01:15:24,793 --> 01:15:26,334
Why are you sleeping here?

976
01:15:27,209 --> 01:15:29,251
Did the boss fire you again?

977
01:15:30,876 --> 01:15:32,501
<i>Bijli</i> it's morning!

978
01:15:33,959 --> 01:15:35,334
Where were you the whole night?

979
01:15:35,918 --> 01:15:37,626
I called your mobile also...

980
01:15:37,709 --> 01:15:39,084
<i>Aye Raju.</i>

981
01:15:40,501 --> 01:15:41,459
Do you know?

982
01:15:41,543 --> 01:15:43,334
You're my most favorite.

983
01:15:44,584 --> 01:15:45,959
Quit this shitty life.

984
01:15:46,418 --> 01:15:47,584
And run away!

985
01:15:48,334 --> 01:15:50,626
Go to the city. Get a respectable job.

986
01:15:51,751 --> 01:15:54,126
Then find a nice girl,

987
01:15:55,334 --> 01:15:57,876
and love her like crazy.

988
01:16:25,834 --> 01:16:30,543
<i>He's sitting in the well...</i>

989
01:16:35,709 --> 01:16:39,584
<i>Hiding in the foliage...</i>

990
01:16:44,918 --> 01:16:49,043
<i>He's quiet and shy...</i>

991
01:16:49,459 --> 01:16:52,001
<i>O Tortoise...</i>

992
01:16:52,043 --> 01:16:54,793
<i>Come out and play!</i>

993
01:16:54,876 --> 01:16:57,584
<i>O Tortoise...</i>

994
01:16:57,668 --> 01:17:00,959
<i>Come out and play!</i>

995
01:17:11,209 --> 01:17:12,709
What the hell are you doing?

996
01:17:12,918 --> 01:17:14,168
Beware <i>Bijli!</i>

997
01:17:14,709 --> 01:17:16,959
The boss said I'm the new queen!

998
01:17:21,168 --> 01:17:23,501
<i>O Tortoise...</i>

999
01:17:23,918 --> 01:17:26,251
<i>Come out and play!</i>

1000
01:17:26,709 --> 01:17:29,418
<i>O Tortoise...</i>

1001
01:17:29,501 --> 01:17:32,501
<i>Come out and play!</i>

1002
01:17:38,584 --> 01:17:39,418
You're back?

1003
01:17:39,459 --> 01:17:40,376
Pinky is busy. Get lost.

1004
01:17:40,459 --> 01:17:41,584
I've brought money asshole!

1005
01:17:41,668 --> 01:17:43,584
Get the fuck out!

1006
01:17:43,668 --> 01:17:45,584
You're not welcome!

1007
01:17:45,918 --> 01:17:49,709
Why don't I call Mommy again?

1008
01:17:51,043 --> 01:17:52,876
Get this punk out of here!

1009
01:17:52,959 --> 01:17:54,751
Stay out of this <i>Kishan!</i>

1010
01:17:54,793 --> 01:17:56,126
Gulab, let me take you home.

1011
01:17:56,959 --> 01:17:58,043
Stay away!

1012
01:17:58,126 --> 01:18:00,126
Go make your skirts.

1013
01:18:00,209 --> 01:18:01,834
I fucking hate you!

1014
01:18:07,584 --> 01:18:10,001
<i>I licked him to life...</i>

1015
01:18:10,293 --> 01:18:12,584
<i>I slither... I slide...</i>

1016
01:18:12,918 --> 01:18:18,876
<i>I shake him... I sway him...</i>

1017
01:18:20,334 --> 01:18:22,459
<i>But I can't seem to wake him!</i>

1018
01:18:23,084 --> 01:18:25,251
<i>Please rise and shine...</i>

1019
01:18:25,584 --> 01:18:31,043
<i>Oh floppy creature of mine...</i>

1020
01:18:36,043 --> 01:18:37,668
<i>Tortoise!</i>

1021
01:18:38,918 --> 01:18:41,876
<i>O Tortoise!</i>

1022
01:18:41,959 --> 01:18:45,126
<i>Come out and play!</i>

1023
01:18:45,209 --> 01:18:50,626
<i>Glorious Tortoise of mine...</i>

1024
01:18:50,668 --> 01:18:55,918
<i>Rise and shine!</i>

1025
01:19:12,084 --> 01:19:13,251
Who is it?

1026
01:19:23,626 --> 01:19:24,918
I need some talcum powder.

1027
01:19:25,918 --> 01:19:28,293
The boss wants me for a big client.

1028
01:19:47,543 --> 01:19:49,876
You must've been
quite hot in your time.

1029
01:19:51,459 --> 01:19:53,459
Must have been in demand too!

1030
01:20:00,459 --> 01:20:02,668
Goodnight <i>Raju.</i>

1031
01:20:06,168 --> 01:20:07,293
What was she doing here?

1032
01:20:07,709 --> 01:20:09,251
She's a cheeky bitch!

1033
01:20:09,334 --> 01:20:10,709
She's perfect for you.

1034
01:20:11,376 --> 01:20:12,834
Go be her slave.

1035
01:20:13,668 --> 01:20:15,251
Make her your ATM machine.

1036
01:20:21,834 --> 01:20:23,001
What are you looking at?

1037
01:20:23,418 --> 01:20:24,501
Your eyes.

1038
01:20:26,543 --> 01:20:28,168
Your eyes are beautiful.

1039
01:20:34,126 --> 01:20:37,084
You're hilarious!

1040
01:20:37,751 --> 01:20:40,709
No man ever looks
above <i>Bijli's</i> chest.

1041
01:20:41,251 --> 01:20:42,334
And you?

1042
01:20:42,501 --> 01:20:43,876
You see my eyes?

1043
01:20:46,918 --> 01:20:48,876
Not just your eyes <i>Bijlii...</i>

1044
01:20:50,584 --> 01:20:52,543
I see all of you.

1045
01:20:53,751 --> 01:20:55,209
When you dance on stage...

1046
01:20:55,293 --> 01:20:56,418
I feel like...

1047
01:20:56,834 --> 01:20:59,209
And when you laugh it's as if...

1048
01:21:00,501 --> 01:21:02,293
And when you tease me...

1049
01:21:03,959 --> 01:21:07,793
But when you're angry with me...

1050
01:21:08,209 --> 01:21:10,459
<i>
 Piss in my pants!</i>

1051
01:21:15,751 --> 01:21:17,209
What are you trying to say?

1052
01:21:21,084 --> 01:21:22,959
Nothing... Just...

1053
01:21:23,876 --> 01:21:26,501
You should value yourself. That's all.

1054
01:21:58,668 --> 01:21:59,793
Hey!

1055
01:22:01,334 --> 01:22:02,543
Who are you?

1056
01:22:03,543 --> 01:22:04,834
What are you doing here?

1057
01:23:00,543 --> 01:23:03,918
You'll get your full payment
before the <i>Dussehra</i> festival.

1058
01:23:05,209 --> 01:23:08,001
But no days off after the festival.

1059
01:23:08,501 --> 01:23:10,959
We're getting a huge order!

1060
01:23:11,043 --> 01:23:12,834
<i>Kunkoo</i> here's your bonus.

1061
01:23:13,168 --> 01:23:16,334
Here's my share for the TV.

1062
01:23:16,751 --> 01:23:19,168
We just need 2000 more!

1063
01:23:19,418 --> 01:23:21,668
Then we're getting TV!

1064
01:23:21,876 --> 01:23:25,043
<i>Rani</i> here's your bonus.

1065
01:23:26,001 --> 01:23:29,501
The client is pleased with
your and <i>Janaki's</i> work.

1066
01:23:30,459 --> 01:23:32,459
One more announcement.

1067
01:23:32,626 --> 01:23:35,293
The Handicraft Committee
has awarded <i>Lajjo...</i>

1068
01:23:35,376 --> 01:23:37,209
The 'Best Worker' title!

1069
01:23:39,084 --> 01:23:41,876
They want to offer
you a permanent job.

1070
01:23:43,001 --> 01:23:44,501
You'll get a monthly salary...

1071
01:23:44,584 --> 01:23:45,793
And a bonus!

1072
01:23:45,876 --> 01:23:47,834
<i>Wow <i>Lajjo!</i></i>

1073
01:24:02,918 --> 01:24:05,626
Lord Krishna has blessed our women.

1074
01:24:06,334 --> 01:24:08,709
Last year <i>Kunkoo</i> prayed
to Him and got pregnant.

1075
01:24:09,751 --> 01:24:12,459
So what if it was a girl.

1076
01:24:13,334 --> 01:24:17,418
This year <i>Lajjo</i> has been blessed!

1077
01:24:18,501 --> 01:24:20,418
Next year it's Jhumki's turn.

1078
01:24:20,918 --> 01:24:23,751
But she needs more than a miracle.

1079
01:24:24,334 --> 01:24:27,001
My son refuses to touch her.

1080
01:24:27,501 --> 01:24:30,001
He says she's as skinny <i>as</i> a reed.

1081
01:24:30,584 --> 01:24:33,084
Does he want someone as flabby as him?

1082
01:24:35,668 --> 01:24:40,043
I can't understand these men.

1083
01:24:40,293 --> 01:24:41,501
They want everything!

1084
01:24:41,584 --> 01:24:45,251
Long hair, doe eyes, voluptuous body.

1085
01:24:45,334 --> 01:24:47,126
<i>Rani... Big boobs!</i>

1086
01:24:47,209 --> 01:24:48,876
Not everyone has big boobs!

1087
01:24:48,959 --> 01:24:50,251
Yes <i>Lajjo</i>, you poor thing.

1088
01:24:50,334 --> 01:24:53,084
You have them but still no action!

1089
01:24:54,209 --> 01:24:55,626
<i>Rani!</i>

1090
01:25:12,459 --> 01:25:16,126
She took a big loan
for <i>Gulab's</i> wedding.

1091
01:25:16,459 --> 01:25:18,668
Even mortgaged her hut.

1092
01:25:20,626 --> 01:25:22,584
I haven't paid interest in 3 months...

1093
01:25:23,209 --> 01:25:24,459
if I can't pay up?

1094
01:25:24,543 --> 01:25:25,918
I'll have to sell my hut.

1095
01:25:26,209 --> 01:25:28,418
Sell your hut. Come live with me.

1096
01:25:28,626 --> 01:25:30,126
I want to meet you.

1097
01:25:30,209 --> 01:25:32,418
Really? You're asking for trouble.

1098
01:25:32,501 --> 01:25:35,293
- I love trouble
- Send me your address.

1099
01:25:35,501 --> 01:25:36,793
I'm coming!

1100
01:25:38,709 --> 01:25:40,168
Just say when.

1101
01:25:41,209 --> 01:25:42,543
I've got to go!

1102
01:25:43,501 --> 01:25:45,043
I wouldn't have come back.

1103
01:25:45,126 --> 01:25:47,584
If I saw you happy.

1104
01:25:47,918 --> 01:25:49,668
My uncle got me a job in the city.

1105
01:25:49,834 --> 01:25:51,084
It doesn't work this way.

1106
01:25:51,168 --> 01:25:52,626
Lets run away. Start afresh!

1107
01:25:53,501 --> 01:25:54,376
Please!

1108
01:25:54,459 --> 01:25:55,293
I beg you.

1109
01:25:55,376 --> 01:25:57,584
Hey you!

1110
01:25:57,959 --> 01:25:59,668
You have some cheek!

1111
01:25:59,959 --> 01:26:02,959
How dare you enter my house?

1112
01:26:03,751 --> 01:26:05,834
I will hand you to the police!

1113
01:26:06,293 --> 01:26:08,084
What are you looking at? Get lost!

1114
01:26:08,918 --> 01:26:11,793
Before the village folk
beat you to a pulp!

1115
01:26:23,959 --> 01:26:27,168
You'll have the TV
by the <i>Dussehra</i> festival.

1116
01:26:27,876 --> 01:26:29,543
Congratulations!

1117
01:26:46,001 --> 01:26:47,459
Oh my... <i>Lajjo!</i>

1118
01:26:48,459 --> 01:26:50,168
Look at you...

1119
01:26:52,084 --> 01:26:54,209
Glowing like a new bride.

1120
01:26:57,459 --> 01:26:59,501
You haven't worn
this necklace in ages.

1121
01:27:01,376 --> 01:27:03,376
It's been passed down for generations.

1122
01:27:04,626 --> 01:27:07,084
Grandma wore it on her wedding day.

1123
01:27:08,043 --> 01:27:11,668
She passed it to my Ma.

1124
01:27:12,501 --> 01:27:15,209
And Ma gave it to my <i>Lajjo...</i>

1125
01:27:15,543 --> 01:27:17,501
At our wedding.

1126
01:27:18,751 --> 01:27:20,918
And you'll give it to...?

1127
01:27:23,709 --> 01:27:25,668
I'm starving.

1128
01:27:26,251 --> 01:27:27,459
Serve dinner.

1129
01:27:50,834 --> 01:27:51,918
So much food.

1130
01:27:52,293 --> 01:27:54,043
Have we won the lottery?

1131
01:27:54,126 --> 01:27:55,584
Something like that.

1132
01:27:55,834 --> 01:27:59,334
I got a hefty advance from <i>Kishan.</i>

1133
01:27:59,418 --> 01:28:01,126
He said...

1134
01:28:01,418 --> 01:28:04,293
The Handicrafts
Committee loves my work.

1135
01:28:04,626 --> 01:28:06,459
I'll be getting a salary every month.

1136
01:28:06,751 --> 01:28:09,168
A salary! Plus a bonus!

1137
01:28:09,251 --> 01:28:11,626
And there's more news...

1138
01:28:12,376 --> 01:28:13,543
I'm two months...

1139
01:28:18,668 --> 01:28:19,834
Get me water!

1140
01:28:30,001 --> 01:28:32,293
Why don't you chuck it in my face?

1141
01:28:32,376 --> 01:28:34,459
Make me look like a good for nothing!

1142
01:28:37,543 --> 01:28:40,459
Bloody bitch! Do yourself a favor.

1143
01:28:41,751 --> 01:28:43,918
Buy yourself a brain with that bonus!

1144
01:29:05,001 --> 01:29:06,209
<i>Bijli...</i>

1145
01:29:06,709 --> 01:29:08,626
Has the boss found a client for me?

1146
01:29:08,918 --> 01:29:09,959
Voilà!

1147
01:29:13,501 --> 01:29:14,668
What's this?

1148
01:29:15,084 --> 01:29:16,418
Just an advance.

1149
01:29:16,501 --> 01:29:19,043
The rest after the job's done.

1150
01:29:19,459 --> 01:29:20,959
He's a big catch.

1151
01:29:22,084 --> 01:29:24,251
Meet him at the bus
stop at 10 o'clock.

1152
01:29:24,876 --> 01:29:27,293
You won't need the boss any more!

1153
01:29:30,543 --> 01:29:31,793
10 o'clock.

1154
01:30:20,543 --> 01:30:22,168
I...<i> Rajesh Rana...</i>

1155
01:30:24,334 --> 01:30:26,126
Have mustered up my courage...

1156
01:30:28,376 --> 01:30:30,084
And my money...

1157
01:30:38,168 --> 01:30:40,001
Let's run away <i>Bijli!</i>

1158
01:30:40,751 --> 01:30:42,543
There's nothing for us here.

1159
01:30:43,001 --> 01:30:45,626
The boss can't see
beyond the new girl.

1160
01:30:46,334 --> 01:30:48,209
He doesn't value you!

1161
01:30:48,751 --> 01:30:50,626
He's itching to throw you out!

1162
01:30:51,209 --> 01:30:52,501
Run away with me.

1163
01:30:53,043 --> 01:30:54,668
<i>We'll go to Delhi.</i>

1164
01:30:55,418 --> 01:30:57,418
I'll handle the business.

1165
01:30:58,126 --> 01:31:00,251
And you'll be my Queen!

1166
01:31:02,209 --> 01:31:04,001
I've arranged everything.

1167
01:31:04,084 --> 01:31:05,668
Please say yes.

1168
01:31:05,751 --> 01:31:08,876
You and I together...
We'll rule <i>Delhi!</i>

1169
01:31:09,876 --> 01:31:11,168
Just say yes!

1170
01:31:17,084 --> 01:31:18,334
I see...

1171
01:31:19,918 --> 01:31:22,084
You want to be my pimp.

1172
01:31:28,751 --> 01:31:29,793
Great!

1173
01:31:35,543 --> 01:31:36,584
Done.

1174
01:31:41,251 --> 01:31:43,376
Let's seal the deal!

1175
01:31:44,543 --> 01:31:46,543
Right here? In the open?

1176
01:31:46,626 --> 01:31:47,834
Come on!

1177
01:31:48,918 --> 01:31:50,918
You want it under that tree?

1178
01:31:51,626 --> 01:31:52,959
Behind the well?

1179
01:31:53,168 --> 01:31:55,418
Or we can go back to my tent!

1180
01:31:55,751 --> 01:31:57,543
Come on!

1181
01:31:58,209 --> 01:32:01,168
Isn't this too much for a simple fuck?

1182
01:32:01,501 --> 01:32:03,459
You could have just
paid my daily rate!

1183
01:32:03,959 --> 01:32:05,918
What kind of pimp will you be?

1184
01:32:06,334 --> 01:32:09,501
<i>Ranaji!</i> Save your festival bonus...

1185
01:32:09,584 --> 01:32:11,043
For some other whores!

1186
01:32:17,876 --> 01:32:19,376
Why are you doing this?

1187
01:32:20,001 --> 01:32:22,418
I did all this for you!

1188
01:32:40,584 --> 01:32:42,126
<i>Raju</i> proposed to me.

1189
01:32:46,584 --> 01:32:48,501
He asked me to be his Queen.

1190
01:32:51,418 --> 01:32:55,501
He wants to be my new pimp.

1191
01:33:04,793 --> 01:33:07,209
The boss is right.

1192
01:33:11,626 --> 01:33:12,751
I forgot.

1193
01:33:13,793 --> 01:33:15,001
I am a whore.

1194
01:33:17,918 --> 01:33:19,751
And that's what I'll always be.

1195
01:33:23,001 --> 01:33:25,168
I really am the scum of society.

1196
01:33:47,168 --> 01:33:49,251
I want a smoke too.

1197
01:34:19,418 --> 01:34:20,709
The village gets TV!

1198
01:34:21,251 --> 01:34:22,709
What a momentous day!

1199
01:34:23,793 --> 01:34:27,959
This has been possible
only because of <i>Kishan</i>.

1200
01:34:28,626 --> 01:34:32,876
The entire village thanks you.

1201
01:34:39,626 --> 01:34:41,126
God bless you!

1202
01:35:07,293 --> 01:35:08,793
<i>Janaki?</i>

1203
01:35:09,501 --> 01:35:10,959
<i>Janaki!</i>

1204
01:35:11,793 --> 01:35:12,751
Come here!

1205
01:35:14,376 --> 01:35:16,918
How dare you steal my money!

1206
01:35:17,876 --> 01:35:19,209
What money Ma?

1207
01:35:19,668 --> 01:35:22,293
Who did you give it to?

1208
01:35:22,959 --> 01:35:23,959
That boy?

1209
01:35:24,209 --> 01:35:25,209
Who is he?

1210
01:35:25,501 --> 01:35:26,918
Don't you run from me!

1211
01:35:28,251 --> 01:35:31,876
I'm struggling to pay back
the loan for your wedding!

1212
01:35:33,084 --> 01:35:34,876
You know I mortgaged
the house for you!

1213
01:35:36,418 --> 01:35:38,793
Still you stole from me?

1214
01:35:39,168 --> 01:35:40,459
<i>ﬁrst Gulab,</i>

1215
01:35:40,543 --> 01:35:42,501
God knows what he's up to!

1216
01:35:42,584 --> 01:35:44,084
And now his bride...

1217
01:35:44,168 --> 01:35:46,043
Steals from her own home.

1218
01:35:46,126 --> 01:35:47,084
<i>Rani?</i>

1219
01:35:47,168 --> 01:35:48,168
What's wrong?

1220
01:35:48,418 --> 01:35:49,459
Is everything alright?

1221
01:35:49,543 --> 01:35:50,959
Get in!

1222
01:35:51,459 --> 01:35:53,459
Why don't you both just kill me!

1223
01:36:00,084 --> 01:36:01,834
Oh come on...

1224
01:36:02,043 --> 01:36:03,043
Don't turn us away.

1225
01:36:03,126 --> 01:36:04,959
We've done business before.

1226
01:36:06,209 --> 01:36:07,418
But the new girl's special.

1227
01:36:07,501 --> 01:36:09,334
Fresh on the market.

1228
01:36:09,668 --> 01:36:11,543
Her rate is 1000.

1229
01:36:11,626 --> 01:36:12,918
No discount.

1230
01:36:13,209 --> 01:36:14,668
Fine.

1231
01:36:15,126 --> 01:36:16,709
800 and not a penny more.

1232
01:36:17,126 --> 01:36:20,334
A trip to the moon for 800.

1233
01:36:20,418 --> 01:36:22,543
You get to ride the rocket.

1234
01:36:23,168 --> 01:36:24,168
<i>Bijli!</i>

1235
01:36:24,459 --> 01:36:25,376
Back off!

1236
01:36:25,876 --> 01:36:27,709
He wants the new girl!

1237
01:36:28,126 --> 01:36:29,626
I'll find someone for you.

1238
01:36:30,334 --> 01:36:34,168
I've had a change of heart.

1239
01:36:34,251 --> 01:36:37,626
I choose the rocket ride with <i>Bijli.</i>

1240
01:36:46,543 --> 01:36:49,001
I'm coming... I'm coming...

1241
01:36:49,876 --> 01:36:52,168
With one full month's advance!

1242
01:36:53,126 --> 01:36:54,126
What?

1243
01:37:01,501 --> 01:37:03,251
I'll call you back.

1244
01:37:11,793 --> 01:37:14,001
Ma can't find her money.

1245
01:37:14,084 --> 01:37:15,626
Have you seen it?

1246
01:37:17,293 --> 01:37:18,918
Ma can't find her money.

1247
01:37:19,001 --> 01:37:20,293
Have you seen it?

1248
01:37:20,501 --> 01:37:22,584
Oh so now you can speak also!

1249
01:37:24,751 --> 01:37:26,376
You took the money, didn't you?

1250
01:37:29,459 --> 01:37:31,084
You took it, didn't you?

1251
01:37:32,876 --> 01:37:34,126
You're calling me a thief?

1252
01:37:34,209 --> 01:37:35,459
You took the money, didn't you?

1253
01:37:35,709 --> 01:37:37,459
What did you say?

1254
01:37:38,209 --> 01:37:41,418
Yes! I took the money!

1255
01:37:41,668 --> 01:37:45,209
You're calling me a thief?

1256
01:37:45,293 --> 01:37:47,584
C'mon! Say it again...

1257
01:37:53,584 --> 01:37:55,334
How dare you call me a thief!

1258
01:37:55,418 --> 01:37:56,793
Bloody bitch!

1259
01:37:58,209 --> 01:38:00,001
Go little rocket!

1260
01:38:00,459 --> 01:38:02,751
Go! Go! Go!

1261
01:38:05,626 --> 01:38:07,126
Ah! More astronauts!

1262
01:38:07,209 --> 01:38:09,209
C'mon! Climb on board the rocket!

1263
01:38:13,459 --> 01:38:16,584
Speed up... 120... 130...

1264
01:38:17,251 --> 01:38:19,168
I'll break this bed today!

1265
01:38:19,251 --> 01:38:22,459
Adios amigos... I'm going to the moon!

1266
01:38:23,959 --> 01:38:26,001
Moooooon!!!

1267
01:38:26,459 --> 01:38:28,126
Bitch!

1268
01:38:29,459 --> 01:38:31,376
<i>Gulab!</i> Get off her!

1269
01:38:32,084 --> 01:38:33,459
This is my house!

1270
01:38:34,293 --> 01:38:35,834
Not your brothel!

1271
01:38:47,459 --> 01:38:49,543
Don't try to find me! Ever!

1272
01:38:50,834 --> 01:38:53,126
You both disgust me!

1273
01:38:53,834 --> 01:38:55,668
May you rot in hell!

1274
01:38:56,418 --> 01:39:00,459
Now I know why my father
left you for a bloody whore!

1275
01:39:04,251 --> 01:39:05,501
I want to see!

1276
01:39:05,584 --> 01:39:08,709
How you bitches survive without a man!

1277
01:39:30,626 --> 01:39:32,418
It's all my fault.

1278
01:39:33,793 --> 01:39:36,209
That boy was at school with me.

1279
01:39:40,626 --> 01:39:42,459
He wanted to marry me.

1280
01:39:45,293 --> 01:39:48,584
But his parents couldn't
afford my dowry.

1281
01:39:53,209 --> 01:39:54,959
I cut off my hair.

1282
01:39:55,834 --> 01:39:58,001
To stop the wedding.

1283
01:40:02,209 --> 01:40:04,751
He rides for hours to see me.

1284
01:40:06,709 --> 01:40:10,918
I never called him... Ever!

1285
01:40:25,293 --> 01:40:28,834
I didn't steal the money Ma!

1286
01:40:44,251 --> 01:40:45,501
<i>Bijli?</i>

1287
01:40:47,959 --> 01:40:51,126
Excellent <i>Bijli...</i> Good job!

1288
01:40:51,209 --> 01:40:53,418
What a comeback!

1289
01:40:54,126 --> 01:40:55,834
They'll be back next week.

1290
01:40:56,084 --> 01:40:58,209
Paid an advance for you.

1291
01:40:58,834 --> 01:41:00,584
Keep your share.

1292
01:41:02,376 --> 01:41:05,001
You beat the new girl!

1293
01:41:07,751 --> 01:41:09,251
Good for you!

1294
01:41:20,584 --> 01:41:23,251
Put your thumb print here.

1295
01:41:33,459 --> 01:41:35,293
After deducting the loan amount,

1296
01:41:35,376 --> 01:41:37,543
this is left from the sale of your hut.

1297
01:41:37,918 --> 01:41:39,168
Count it.

1298
01:41:43,793 --> 01:41:45,293
Where will you go now?

1299
01:41:48,626 --> 01:41:52,043
Maybe I'll go see my parents...

1300
01:41:53,126 --> 01:41:55,501
I never went back after marriage.

1301
01:42:03,209 --> 01:42:04,793
Take it. Take it.

1302
01:42:06,876 --> 01:42:08,876
She's smart and loves books.

1303
01:42:08,959 --> 01:42:10,793
Enroll her in school.

1304
01:42:12,459 --> 01:42:13,918
She's my daughter.

1305
01:42:15,084 --> 01:42:17,751
If anything happens to her,
I'll kill you!

1306
01:42:26,626 --> 01:42:28,668
I bought you a mobile.

1307
01:42:31,209 --> 01:42:32,501
To keep in touch.

1308
01:42:40,084 --> 01:42:41,084
Ma.

1309
01:42:41,334 --> 01:42:43,001
I will miss you!

1310
01:42:49,126 --> 01:42:51,501
I'll come visit you in your new home.

1311
01:43:01,043 --> 01:43:01,959
Go on.

1312
01:43:02,043 --> 01:43:03,918
God bless you both.

1313
01:43:36,459 --> 01:43:38,751
Look, it's that skirtfucker <i>Kishan</i>.

1314
01:43:39,834 --> 01:43:42,251
His game needs to end.

1315
01:43:44,209 --> 01:43:47,001
The New Village Hero!

1316
01:43:47,543 --> 01:43:49,834
Hero soon-to-be zero!

1317
01:44:12,918 --> 01:44:14,918
Motherfucker...

1318
01:44:15,751 --> 01:44:17,084
<i>Gulab</i> what are you doing?

1319
01:44:22,418 --> 01:44:24,001
You're no hero!

1320
01:44:26,418 --> 01:44:27,834
Show him! Bastard!

1321
01:44:42,334 --> 01:44:46,334
<i>Today is Dussehra,
a most auspicious day...</i>

1322
01:44:50,501 --> 01:44:54,501
<i>A day of transformation... And truth.</i>

1323
01:45:00,584 --> 01:45:04,834
<i>Today Lord Ram decimated
the Demon King Ra van.</i>

1324
01:45:04,918 --> 01:45:06,918
<i>Today is Victory day!</i>

1325
01:45:12,459 --> 01:45:14,293
Let's go to the temple tonight.

1326
01:45:15,709 --> 01:45:17,084
It's a day of thanks.

1327
01:45:17,834 --> 01:45:20,418
And we have much to be grateful for.

1328
01:45:22,626 --> 01:45:23,959
If it's a boy...

1329
01:45:24,584 --> 01:45:26,084
We'll name him after Lord <i>Ram.</i>

1330
01:45:27,334 --> 01:45:29,043
He too will destroy evil.

1331
01:45:30,751 --> 01:45:32,126
But to tell you the truth...

1332
01:45:33,459 --> 01:45:34,918
I want a daughter.

1333
01:45:35,834 --> 01:45:37,751
What are you saying <i>Lajjo?</i>

1334
01:45:38,584 --> 01:45:40,043
You're listening?

1335
01:45:44,959 --> 01:45:46,584
I'm pregnant.

1336
01:45:51,126 --> 01:45:52,168
What?

1337
01:45:54,959 --> 01:45:56,334
I'm pregnant!

1338
01:45:59,876 --> 01:46:01,251
I'm pregnant!

1339
01:46:01,293 --> 01:46:02,959
Finally!

1340
01:46:08,584 --> 01:46:09,876
What's wrong?

1341
01:46:10,418 --> 01:46:12,209
Isn't this what you wanted?

1342
01:46:15,501 --> 01:46:17,084
Tell me, who did you fuck?

1343
01:46:17,876 --> 01:46:19,543
Whose sin is in your belly?

1344
01:46:20,668 --> 01:46:22,001
No one's!

1345
01:46:22,376 --> 01:46:24,001
Who else's would it be?

1346
01:46:24,376 --> 01:46:25,626
It's yours!

1347
01:46:26,084 --> 01:46:27,209
My child?

1348
01:46:27,834 --> 01:46:29,168
You think I'm an idiot?

1349
01:46:29,251 --> 01:46:30,418
That you can trick me?

1350
01:46:30,959 --> 01:46:32,918
Fucking whore!

1351
01:46:38,251 --> 01:46:39,834
Why can't it be yours?

1352
01:46:45,168 --> 01:46:47,084
Tell me why it can't be yours?

1353
01:46:48,918 --> 01:46:50,584
Hit me all you want...

1354
01:46:51,209 --> 01:46:52,626
It won't change a thing...

1355
01:46:52,709 --> 01:46:54,918
This child is yours and yours alone!

1356
01:46:59,293 --> 01:47:01,209
IT CAN'T BE MINE!

1357
01:47:01,293 --> 01:47:03,501
Because you're a whore!

1358
01:47:04,043 --> 01:47:05,501
A dirty whore!

1359
01:47:06,584 --> 01:47:08,001
I may be a whore...

1360
01:47:08,584 --> 01:47:10,126
But I am not barren!

1361
01:47:14,043 --> 01:47:15,168
<i>Naobi!</i>

1362
01:47:16,376 --> 01:47:17,126
<i>Kishan?</i>

1363
01:47:17,209 --> 01:47:18,084
What happened?

1364
01:47:18,626 --> 01:47:20,293
He's lying half-dead in the hospital.

1365
01:47:20,501 --> 01:47:23,793
We can't live here anymore.
We're leaving!

1366
01:47:24,001 --> 01:47:25,959
If fate allows, we'll meet again.

1367
01:47:33,543 --> 01:47:37,709
<i>Today we celebrate
the Divine power of the Feminine.</i>

1368
01:47:38,209 --> 01:47:42,293
<i>Today Goddess Durga decimated
the great demon Mahisur.</i>

1369
01:47:49,251 --> 01:47:50,834
Listen...

1370
01:47:54,084 --> 01:47:55,959
Accept this child as your own Manoj.

1371
01:47:58,251 --> 01:48:00,043
You've always wanted a child.

1372
01:48:03,876 --> 01:48:05,793
This is your chance!

1373
01:48:18,584 --> 01:48:20,209
Fine. Go tell the Elders...

1374
01:48:21,459 --> 01:48:23,501
Announce to the whole village...

1375
01:48:23,584 --> 01:48:25,043
That your wife is a whore!

1376
01:48:26,459 --> 01:48:28,376
She slept with another man...

1377
01:48:28,459 --> 01:48:30,334
And that's how she got pregnant.

1378
01:48:32,501 --> 01:48:34,084
Because you couldn't do it!

1379
01:48:34,251 --> 01:48:36,293
Because YOU are the barren one!

1380
01:48:39,793 --> 01:48:41,334
<i>Lajjo!...</i> Open the door!

1381
01:48:42,709 --> 01:48:43,918
<i>Lajjo!</i>

1382
01:48:46,418 --> 01:48:48,876
Let go of her! Bastard!

1383
01:49:08,376 --> 01:49:12,668
<i>As Lord Ram's arrow
pierced Ravan's navel...</i>

1384
01:49:12,959 --> 01:49:16,126
<i>The Demon King burst into flames!</i>

1385
01:49:18,376 --> 01:49:19,751
<i>Lajjo!</i> Help!

1386
01:49:20,668 --> 01:49:26,668
<i>Good won over Evil.</i>

1387
01:49:27,209 --> 01:49:29,584
<i>Truth defeated Deceit.</i>

1388
01:49:49,543 --> 01:49:53,584
<i>Today we cleanse our lives.</i>

1389
01:49:54,126 --> 01:49:56,834
<i>Today we rise above our fears.</i>

1390
01:49:58,334 --> 01:50:01,043
<i>Today we let the Light enter.</i>

1391
01:50:01,626 --> 01:50:04,501
<i>Today we leave darkness behind.</i>

1392
01:50:09,126 --> 01:50:10,459
<i>Bijli!</i>

1393
01:50:11,293 --> 01:50:12,376
What's wrong?

1394
01:50:17,209 --> 01:50:18,709
It's burnt.

1395
01:51:10,543 --> 01:51:12,626
I feel like I have to go all the time.

1396
01:51:13,626 --> 01:51:16,001
Like there's a well inside me.

1397
01:51:28,918 --> 01:51:30,168
<i>Bijli...</i>

1398
01:51:31,668 --> 01:51:33,584
I've never seen you like this.

1399
01:51:39,793 --> 01:51:41,709
Will you really run away with us?

1400
01:51:42,334 --> 01:51:43,668
Leave everything behind?

1401
01:51:47,501 --> 01:51:49,543
You've done so much for us.

1402
01:51:51,584 --> 01:51:55,376
You have no idea what
you both have done for me.

1403
01:52:01,001 --> 01:52:02,918
I've heard many
promises over the years...

1404
01:52:03,918 --> 01:52:06,501
But no one came through.

1405
01:52:07,834 --> 01:52:10,084
You did. You set <i>Bijli</i> free!

1406
01:52:26,793 --> 01:52:28,168
Look <i>Rani.</i>

1407
01:52:28,584 --> 01:52:29,709
Your hair is burnt.

1408
01:52:31,501 --> 01:52:33,501
Rani's hair is burnt!

1409
01:52:35,376 --> 01:52:36,668
<i>Hey Rani...</i>

1410
01:52:37,043 --> 01:52:38,834
Imagine... What will people say?

1411
01:52:39,126 --> 01:52:41,334
Rani will have to
cut her hair like <i>Janaki.</i>

1412
01:52:41,418 --> 01:52:44,334
Quiet! You duffers.

1413
01:52:50,834 --> 01:52:53,293
Where should we go?

1414
01:52:53,376 --> 01:52:54,293
<i>Mumbai!</i>

1415
01:52:54,376 --> 01:52:56,584
<i>Oh no... Not Mumbai!</i>

1416
01:52:56,876 --> 01:52:58,001
Why not?

1417
01:52:58,293 --> 01:53:01,043
I want my child to have
a childhood like mine.

1418
01:53:01,126 --> 01:53:02,751
She'll dance in the fields...

1419
01:53:02,834 --> 01:53:04,126
Bathe in the river...

1420
01:53:04,209 --> 01:53:06,293
Catch butterflies in the Spring...

1421
01:53:06,376 --> 01:53:09,834
And who will earn the money?
Your father?

1422
01:53:09,918 --> 01:53:12,168
There are no men now. Just us.

1423
01:53:12,251 --> 01:53:15,751
<i>Kishan</i> has shown
us that we can survive!

1424
01:53:15,834 --> 01:53:18,584
Skillful sewing...
beats skillful screwing!

1425
01:53:23,834 --> 01:53:25,751
Rani your phone's ringing!

1426
01:53:25,834 --> 01:53:28,459
It's <i>Shahrukh Khan!</i>

1427
01:53:29,459 --> 01:53:31,043
<i>Rani...</i> Answer <i>it.</i>

1428
01:53:31,126 --> 01:53:32,793
Ask him...

1429
01:53:32,876 --> 01:53:34,626
Should we go left or right?

1430
01:53:42,543 --> 01:53:44,793
<i>Rani?</i> Where are you my love?

1431
01:53:44,959 --> 01:53:46,293
At a crossroad...

1432
01:53:46,626 --> 01:53:48,834
Wondering whether to go left or right.

1433
01:53:48,918 --> 01:53:50,751
So what will it be?

1434
01:53:51,043 --> 01:53:52,251
From now on...

1435
01:53:52,501 --> 01:53:54,043
I'll let my heart decide.
