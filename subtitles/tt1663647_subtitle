1
00:01:54,861 --> 00:01:55,828
How is Pia?

2
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:58,188
She misses you.

3
00:02:02,569 --> 00:02:06,300
Suzan. Suzan.

4
00:02:11,545 --> 00:02:14,912
She always asks me,
When will mummy come back?

5
00:02:19,619 --> 00:02:22,281
Suzan. Suzan.

6
00:02:25,325 --> 00:02:27,122
The mirror can't harm you.

7
00:02:28,295 --> 00:02:29,319
Understood?

8
00:02:34,434 --> 00:02:37,335
Joe, we've suffered a loss.

9
00:02:40,307 --> 00:02:43,936
We've suffered a huge loss, Joe.
- Suzan.

10
00:02:44,377 --> 00:02:45,935
You can never understand.

11
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:50,874
Relax, Suzan.

12
00:02:51,918 --> 00:02:55,354
I can't endure it any longer.
- Suzan.

13
00:02:55,655 --> 00:02:59,250
I am sorry. I... I... - Suzan.

14
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,721
Listen to me.
- I can't endure this any longer.

15
00:03:02,796 --> 00:03:05,697
We'll have to stop him.

16
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:07,425
This has to stop.

17
00:03:07,701 --> 00:03:09,794
This has to stop.

18
00:03:10,871 --> 00:03:12,736
Joe, I am sorry...
- Suzan, listen to me.

19
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,739
Suzan. - I will have to do it.

20
00:03:14,808 --> 00:03:16,275
Listen to me, Suzan.
- I will have to do it.

21
00:03:16,343 --> 00:03:18,436
Everything will be fine.
- Please, Suzan.

22
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,676
Help! Help!

23
00:03:21,715 --> 00:03:22,909
No, Suzan, don't.

24
00:03:23,383 --> 00:03:24,509
Suzan.

25
00:03:25,452 --> 00:03:27,113
No, Suzan. No, no.

26
00:03:28,188 --> 00:03:29,212
Suzan.

27
00:03:29,456 --> 00:03:35,452
Help! Help! Help!

28
00:07:04,471 --> 00:07:05,495
He's back.

29
00:07:10,276 --> 00:07:12,642
He... he killed Peach.

30
00:07:13,413 --> 00:07:14,744
Now, it's our turn.

31
00:07:15,448 --> 00:07:17,143
He... he will kill all of us.

32
00:07:18,752 --> 00:07:20,276
He won't spare anyone.

33
00:07:36,569 --> 00:07:37,593
Good job.

34
00:07:45,378 --> 00:07:48,711
Vic has done a very good job
especially the climax.

35
00:07:49,749 --> 00:07:51,876
Yes, he has worked very hard.

36
00:07:59,526 --> 00:08:02,256
Vic, congratulations.
- Thanks so much, Natasha.

37
00:08:02,328 --> 00:08:03,795
It was a pleasure
working with you.

38
00:08:03,863 --> 00:08:05,296
It was great working with you too.

39
00:08:05,365 --> 00:08:08,732
So, what do you think?
- I don't think it's a good idea.

40
00:08:10,136 --> 00:08:11,262
Excuse me. - Sure.

41
00:08:14,174 --> 00:08:16,335
Hi, Natasha. - Hi, Pia.

42
00:08:21,114 --> 00:08:23,173
Excuse me, sir. One photo. - Sure.

43
00:08:32,592 --> 00:08:33,616
Pia.

44
00:08:35,328 --> 00:08:36,488
I need to talk to you.

45
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,324
Pia.

46
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:41,183
Hello.

47
00:09:42,795 --> 00:09:44,262
Hey, Carol, what's up?

48
00:10:16,696 --> 00:10:19,688
Dad had a heart attack. - What?

49
00:11:29,302 --> 00:11:34,569
Papa. - Pia. Vic. You two are here?

50
00:11:35,174 --> 00:11:37,699
How are you, Papa?
- I am fine, dear.

51
00:11:39,412 --> 00:11:40,879
Thank God it was a
mild heart attack.

52
00:11:42,148 --> 00:11:44,446
Thankfully, the neighbours called
me at the right moment.

53
00:11:45,418 --> 00:11:47,181
And you called them here.

54
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,682
Papa, this is serious.

55
00:11:48,855 --> 00:11:52,313
You should look after your health.
- Yes, Dad. She's right.

56
00:11:53,226 --> 00:11:54,284
Now, you'll have to.

57
00:11:54,894 --> 00:11:56,225
She's here now.

58
00:11:58,264 --> 00:12:00,892
Don't worry.
Uncle will be discharged.

59
00:12:01,134 --> 00:12:02,192
Thanks a lot, Carol.

60
00:12:02,268 --> 00:12:05,431
If it wasn't for you...
- Come on, Pia, don't be silly.

61
00:12:06,606 --> 00:12:10,303
You know, I've told papa so many
times not to come here...

62
00:12:10,743 --> 00:12:15,203
...but he always comes here making
some excuse or the other.

63
00:12:16,182 --> 00:12:18,241
Pia,
this is where he was the happiest.

64
00:12:18,684 --> 00:12:21,175
He has spent the happiest
days of his life.

65
00:12:22,155 --> 00:12:23,349
And the saddest as well.

66
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:26,119
He's fine now. - He's resting.

67
00:12:26,192 --> 00:12:27,216
Hey, Vic.

68
00:12:27,293 --> 00:12:29,420
Pia told me that your movie
has shaped up really well.

69
00:12:31,697 --> 00:12:33,790
Actually, it has you know.
- Oh, lovely.

70
00:12:33,866 --> 00:12:36,232
And what about your college?
- College? - How is everything?

71
00:12:36,602 --> 00:12:37,694
Oh, I forgot.

72
00:12:38,237 --> 00:12:39,670
I've to submit my thesis.

73
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,136
I'll be back tomorrow.

74
00:12:41,207 --> 00:12:43,539
Do you want to submit your
thesis or meet Aditya?

75
00:12:43,609 --> 00:12:45,873
Stop it, Pia. - Take care.

76
00:12:46,245 --> 00:12:47,803
Bye. - Bye, Vic, take care.

77
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,177
Bye, Carol.

78
00:16:30,469 --> 00:16:32,869
'Happy birthday to you.'

79
00:16:33,105 --> 00:16:36,131
'Happy birthday to Pia.'

80
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:37,903
'Happy birthday to Dia.'

81
00:16:38,144 --> 00:16:39,839
'Happy birthday to you.'

82
00:16:40,846 --> 00:16:43,144
'Happy birthday to you.'

83
00:18:17,243 --> 00:18:18,267
Pia!

84
00:18:19,779 --> 00:18:20,803
She was here.

85
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,507
She was here. - Who?

86
00:18:23,349 --> 00:18:26,716
Dia. Dia was here.
- Relax. It was just a dream, Pia.

87
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,088
You've returned to this house
after so many years.

88
00:18:30,156 --> 00:18:31,817
You've spent your childhood
here with Dia.

89
00:18:32,425 --> 00:18:34,359
Obviously,
you're going to think about her.

90
00:18:35,261 --> 00:18:36,285
Relax, okay.

91
00:19:33,752 --> 00:19:35,219
This is the place, isn't it?

92
00:20:02,781 --> 00:20:05,648
Normally I would always
be with her.

93
00:20:07,586 --> 00:20:10,180
But that day I was not with her.

94
00:20:13,659 --> 00:20:17,595
I can never forgive
myself for this.

95
00:20:48,861 --> 00:20:51,193
Finally, we're home. - Thank God.

96
00:20:56,468 --> 00:20:58,436
Come, dad. - Thanks, son.

97
00:21:06,845 --> 00:21:09,575
So how's your film going?
- Its almost complete.

98
00:21:09,915 --> 00:21:11,348
Just two more days of work.

99
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,445
I will finish it as
soon as I go back.

100
00:21:14,687 --> 00:21:16,416
I am really feeling guilty, Vic.

101
00:21:17,222 --> 00:21:20,248
For my sake you had to...
- Dad. Don't say that.

102
00:21:29,635 --> 00:21:32,866
Tracy. Tracy, what happened?
- What happened to you?

103
00:21:32,938 --> 00:21:35,236
Calm down, baby, what happened?

104
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:37,304
Relax, sit down, sit down.

105
00:21:38,444 --> 00:21:40,912
Calm down. - My baby, what's wrong?

106
00:21:42,514 --> 00:21:45,677
My baby, what's wrong?
Why are you howling?

107
00:22:17,783 --> 00:22:21,446
Pia. - Carol, Dia was right here.

108
00:22:21,687 --> 00:22:23,416
What? There's no one here.

109
00:22:23,489 --> 00:22:26,424
Believe me, I just saw Dia.

110
00:22:26,492 --> 00:22:27,823
How is that possible, Pia?

111
00:22:27,893 --> 00:22:30,726
Dia is dead.
- Listen, Dia was here.

112
00:22:31,263 --> 00:22:32,423
Believe me.

113
00:22:32,931 --> 00:22:35,729
You know,
Carol, since I arrived here...

114
00:22:35,801 --> 00:22:37,393
...l've been sensing
someone around.

115
00:22:40,506 --> 00:22:41,666
No one understands.

116
00:23:31,623 --> 00:23:32,647
Pia.

117
00:23:33,692 --> 00:23:34,716
Hey, Pia.

118
00:23:35,461 --> 00:23:36,519
What's the problem?

119
00:23:37,696 --> 00:23:38,822
Is everything alright?

120
00:23:39,832 --> 00:23:41,493
You seemed worried last
night as well.

121
00:23:42,267 --> 00:23:43,894
You can't hide anything from me.

122
00:23:45,204 --> 00:23:47,468
I can clearly see it on your face,
Pia.

123
00:23:47,706 --> 00:23:49,230
You seem stressed about it.

124
00:23:49,808 --> 00:23:57,305
Is it Vic. - You know... I
feel Vic and Natasha...

125
00:23:58,617 --> 00:24:02,713
Natasha. The heroine of his film?
- That's right.

126
00:24:06,391 --> 00:24:08,382
Whenever I read the newspapers
in the morning...

127
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,587
...there's something always written
about both of them.

128
00:24:10,662 --> 00:24:13,256
Come on, Pia, you know.

129
00:24:13,632 --> 00:24:15,497
They reporters write anything.

130
00:24:15,768 --> 00:24:17,895
And half of it is a lie.

131
00:24:18,137 --> 00:24:20,105
And half of it is true, isn't it?

132
00:24:20,439 --> 00:24:23,306
Don't ruin your life believing
half the truth.

133
00:24:26,545 --> 00:24:31,141
Carol, I'm pregnant.
- That's great news.

134
00:24:31,483 --> 00:24:33,542
Now you two can have
a new beginning.

135
00:24:33,619 --> 00:24:35,519
This is the right moment.
- You know.

136
00:24:36,155 --> 00:24:38,316
I don't know whether this is
the right moment or not.

137
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:39,823
I am slightly nervous
about this child.

138
00:24:39,892 --> 00:24:41,257
Don't even think about it.

139
00:24:41,493 --> 00:24:42,585
You know it's a sin.

140
00:24:44,129 --> 00:24:45,596
Pia, go and talk to Vic.

141
00:24:45,831 --> 00:24:47,822
Believe me,
everything will be fine.

142
00:24:49,134 --> 00:24:51,762
In life you find true
love only once.

143
00:24:52,704 --> 00:24:56,572
And you'll realise that
when you lose him.

144
00:25:06,752 --> 00:25:08,720
These were the most beautiful
moments of my life.

145
00:25:15,894 --> 00:25:22,231
Look at this.
Dia's favourite doll.

146
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:27,136
And when she passed away...

147
00:25:27,773 --> 00:25:29,798
...we felt that Dia is incomplete
without this doll.

148
00:25:30,776 --> 00:25:33,142
We also buried this doll
along with Dia.

149
00:25:37,282 --> 00:25:40,376
And after that nothing
remained the same.

150
00:25:41,453 --> 00:25:42,511
Everything changed.

151
00:25:43,255 --> 00:25:44,847
Suzan couldn't endure this loss.

152
00:25:52,464 --> 00:25:54,591
'Papa.
Papa, what's wrong with Dia? '

153
00:25:54,933 --> 00:25:56,764
'Dia,
why don't you say something? '

154
00:25:57,502 --> 00:26:01,131
'Dia, why don't you say
something? ' -'Say something, Dia.'

155
00:26:11,483 --> 00:26:14,281
'After Dia's death
Suzan went crazy.'

156
00:26:15,587 --> 00:26:17,487
'And we had to take her
to the mental asylum.'

157
00:26:28,166 --> 00:26:29,190
Hello.

158
00:26:29,735 --> 00:26:30,895
Yes, just a second.

159
00:26:31,336 --> 00:26:32,360
Excuse me.

160
00:26:36,408 --> 00:26:37,500
I'll be back.

161
00:26:38,844 --> 00:26:42,280
Try to understand.
Pia needs me right now.

162
00:26:42,781 --> 00:26:44,715
And there's so much
stress between us.

163
00:26:45,384 --> 00:26:47,909
Listen ask him to give
dates for next week.

164
00:26:49,187 --> 00:26:50,279
Give him any reason.

165
00:26:50,689 --> 00:26:52,281
Damn it, why don't you understand?

166
00:26:52,357 --> 00:26:54,416
I suggest you tell him that
I am stuck over here, okay.

167
00:26:54,493 --> 00:26:55,517
I am stuck.

168
00:26:58,563 --> 00:27:00,292
I will call you... I will
call you back, bye.

169
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:06,128
You know what, Vic.

170
00:27:06,705 --> 00:27:08,172
I will look after papa.

171
00:27:08,607 --> 00:27:13,340
You can leave if you want. - Leave.

172
00:27:14,846 --> 00:27:17,178
Where and why?

173
00:27:18,183 --> 00:27:19,480
What is wrong with you, Pia?

174
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:23,383
You're complicating your life.

175
00:27:23,722 --> 00:27:26,589
You know you doubting me like
this is driving me crazy!

176
00:27:27,225 --> 00:27:28,624
You've created a rift between us!

177
00:27:30,796 --> 00:27:31,820
Forget it!

178
00:27:33,398 --> 00:27:34,422
Just forget it!

179
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:53,681
We came here to clear these rifts.

180
00:27:55,454 --> 00:27:58,685
Vic. I am pregnant.

181
00:28:04,129 --> 00:28:05,153
Yes.

182
00:28:10,135 --> 00:28:11,363
You know I love you.

183
00:28:13,372 --> 00:28:14,566
I can't live without you.

184
00:28:16,508 --> 00:28:17,532
I am so happy.

185
00:28:19,277 --> 00:28:22,246
I am so happy. - I am sorry.

186
00:28:24,149 --> 00:28:25,241
I am really sorry.

187
00:28:42,234 --> 00:28:45,260
Two innocent eyes.

188
00:28:45,871 --> 00:28:48,863
Speak the truth.

189
00:28:49,374 --> 00:28:52,810
It's a romantic ambience.

190
00:28:53,211 --> 00:28:56,476
And the desires in the
heart are young.

191
00:28:57,549 --> 00:29:00,450
Two innocent eyes.

192
00:29:01,186 --> 00:29:04,349
Speak the truth.

193
00:29:04,589 --> 00:29:08,047
It's a romantic ambience.

194
00:29:08,493 --> 00:29:11,724
And the desires in the
heart are young.

195
00:29:11,797 --> 00:29:18,794
I want to say what
I couldn't before.

196
00:29:19,604 --> 00:29:25,702
You're my life.

197
00:29:27,345 --> 00:29:33,875
I want to say what
I couldn't before.

198
00:29:34,886 --> 00:29:41,155
You're my life.

199
00:30:14,426 --> 00:30:18,795
Your arms are my world.

200
00:30:18,864 --> 00:30:21,424
I belong to you.

201
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:24,936
Whenever you're with me.

202
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:28,901
I feel protected.

203
00:30:29,774 --> 00:30:32,766
Your arms are my world.

204
00:30:33,345 --> 00:30:36,781
I belong to you.

205
00:30:36,848 --> 00:30:40,477
Whenever you're with me.

206
00:30:40,552 --> 00:30:44,215
I feel protected.

207
00:30:44,556 --> 00:30:48,185
You're my life.

208
00:30:51,463 --> 00:30:58,960
I want to say what
I couldn't before.

209
00:31:00,372 --> 00:31:07,574
You're my life.

210
00:31:46,551 --> 00:31:53,320
Let me hide you in my sights.

211
00:31:54,292 --> 00:32:01,221
Don't tell anyone
where I hid you.

212
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:08,831
Hide me in your sights.

213
00:32:09,507 --> 00:32:16,572
Don't ever let me separate
from you.

214
00:32:17,616 --> 00:32:23,748
I want to say what
I couldn't before.

215
00:32:23,822 --> 00:32:30,318
You're my life.

216
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:38,328
You're my world.

217
00:32:39,337 --> 00:32:46,140
You're my life.

218
00:32:46,945 --> 00:32:53,942
I want to say what
I couldn't before.

219
00:32:54,819 --> 00:33:00,451
You're my life.

220
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:09,362
Always remain by my side.

221
00:33:10,201 --> 00:33:15,901
You're my life.

222
00:33:37,862 --> 00:33:40,422
Happy birthday to you.

223
00:33:40,832 --> 00:33:43,323
Happy birthday dear Pia.

224
00:33:43,635 --> 00:33:46,536
Happy birthday to you.

225
00:33:46,604 --> 00:33:48,697
Happy birthday, Pia.

226
00:33:49,441 --> 00:33:50,738
Happy birthday to you.

227
00:33:51,276 --> 00:33:52,300
I love you.

228
00:33:53,178 --> 00:33:54,475
Happy birthday. - Thank you.

229
00:33:56,281 --> 00:33:57,942
Dad. There is good news for you.

230
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:03,216
Pia is pregnant.
- Congratulations, dear.

231
00:34:03,288 --> 00:34:05,119
Thank you, dad.
- Cut the cake, guys.

232
00:34:05,323 --> 00:34:06,756
Yes, come on. - Blow the candles.

233
00:34:19,704 --> 00:34:22,400
Happy birthday to you.

234
00:34:40,825 --> 00:34:41,849
Oh my God.

235
00:34:41,926 --> 00:34:43,154
What's this...

236
00:39:54,105 --> 00:39:55,129
So there you are.

237
00:39:58,476 --> 00:39:59,636
Good morning, babes.

238
00:40:00,845 --> 00:40:02,244
You know I was thinking...

239
00:40:02,613 --> 00:40:04,740
...let's raze down our
study and convert...

240
00:40:04,816 --> 00:40:06,283
...it into a children's room.

241
00:40:06,818 --> 00:40:08,649
You know,
make it nice and colourful.

242
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:10,380
Filled with lots of toys.

243
00:40:11,923 --> 00:40:13,117
Pia.

244
00:40:28,606 --> 00:40:29,868
Pia, take Carol inside.

245
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:50,887
Since Pia arrived here...

246
00:41:51,923 --> 00:41:54,448
...she's been behaving strangely.

247
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:07,433
I suspect... something unnatural
is happening in this house.

248
00:42:14,579 --> 00:42:16,604
Dad. - Yes, Vic.

249
00:42:17,315 --> 00:42:19,806
Where's the fuse box?
- Down in the garage.

250
00:42:20,451 --> 00:42:21,475
Okay.

251
00:42:28,926 --> 00:42:30,291
Did you find it?

252
00:42:30,361 --> 00:42:32,488
It's right there behind the door.
- Yes, I found it.

253
00:42:33,264 --> 00:42:34,356
The power is back on.

254
00:43:04,362 --> 00:43:06,159
Pia. You here at this hour?

255
00:43:13,337 --> 00:43:15,168
Pia, I know what your problem is.

256
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:18,838
I know. - Since you arrived here...

257
00:43:19,343 --> 00:43:23,780
...you've been seeing Dia and
now the incident with Tracy.

258
00:43:27,451 --> 00:43:29,749
Pia, you loved Tracy a lot.

259
00:43:31,122 --> 00:43:33,181
But you aren't sad about
her death at all.

260
00:43:34,325 --> 00:43:36,816
You were behaving very odd.

261
00:43:37,595 --> 00:43:39,290
I've never seen you
behave this way.

262
00:43:39,597 --> 00:43:40,621
Never.

263
00:43:46,537 --> 00:43:48,528
Such issues don't
resolve this way.

264
00:43:50,141 --> 00:43:53,133
Pia, you're my best friend and
I can't see you this way.

265
00:43:53,911 --> 00:43:56,709
Come with me,
I will introduce you to Aditya.

266
00:43:57,848 --> 00:43:59,543
He's a parapsychologist.

267
00:44:00,151 --> 00:44:01,311
And he will help you.

268
00:44:38,422 --> 00:44:40,913
Carol. Carol. - Yes.

269
00:44:42,193 --> 00:44:45,219
You wanted to introduce me to
Aditya, didn't you? - Let's go.

270
00:44:45,596 --> 00:44:47,188
Let's have lunch before that.

271
00:44:47,865 --> 00:44:49,492
Okay. - I'll be right back.

272
00:44:56,741 --> 00:44:57,765
Okay.

273
00:44:58,275 --> 00:44:59,902
We're coming back right
after lunch.

274
00:45:00,344 --> 00:45:01,641
Okay. Perfect.

275
00:45:07,518 --> 00:45:09,213
Adi, I'll call you right back.

276
00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:13,448
Pia.

277
00:45:23,401 --> 00:45:24,425
Pia.

278
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:27,796
Pia.

279
00:45:28,539 --> 00:45:29,597
Hey, Pia.

280
00:45:34,311 --> 00:45:36,677
Hello.
- Hello, Carol, where are you?

281
00:45:37,782 --> 00:45:39,909
Pia and I are waiting for you.
- What...

282
00:45:46,223 --> 00:45:47,281
Hello. Hello.

283
00:46:21,192 --> 00:46:22,784
O Lord, our God.

284
00:46:23,527 --> 00:46:25,256
You're the source of our life.

285
00:46:25,863 --> 00:46:27,797
In you we live and move.

286
00:46:28,265 --> 00:46:29,391
And have our being.

287
00:46:30,134 --> 00:46:34,366
Keep us in life and death in
your love and by your grace.

288
00:46:35,339 --> 00:46:36,670
Lead us to your kingdom...

289
00:46:37,341 --> 00:46:40,333
...through your son Jesus
Christ our Lord.

290
00:46:42,513 --> 00:46:45,482
Eternal rest grant unto her.

291
00:46:46,550 --> 00:46:51,783
O Lord. And may the perpetual
light shine upon her.

292
00:46:52,590 --> 00:46:55,184
And may her soul rest in peace.

293
00:46:56,527 --> 00:46:58,154
From dust we came.

294
00:46:58,596 --> 00:47:00,530
To dust we shall return.

295
00:47:01,499 --> 00:47:06,368
Jesus Christ our saviour shall
raise you up on the last stage.

296
00:47:14,345 --> 00:47:17,314
'Something unnatural is happening
in this house.'

297
00:47:23,621 --> 00:47:25,418
'And especially with Pia.'

298
00:47:35,633 --> 00:47:36,657
Papa, let's go.

299
00:47:49,213 --> 00:47:50,237
I am really sorry.

300
00:47:51,649 --> 00:47:53,241
I am really sorry. - Just a minute.

301
00:47:53,717 --> 00:47:56,185
Your wife Pia, it's about her.

302
00:47:56,854 --> 00:47:58,219
She needs help.

303
00:48:04,361 --> 00:48:07,330
Aditya Motwani,
University of Mauritius.

304
00:48:08,299 --> 00:48:09,459
You will find me there.

305
00:49:05,556 --> 00:49:07,683
Hey, Pia. You okay?

306
00:49:13,063 --> 00:49:14,530
I can understand how
you're feeling.

307
00:49:16,133 --> 00:49:17,361
Carol was your best friend.

308
00:49:20,237 --> 00:49:23,263
You know,
Pia, I don't feel right here.

309
00:49:25,142 --> 00:49:26,336
Let's go back to Mumbai.

310
00:49:35,219 --> 00:49:36,846
Just a few more days.

311
00:50:26,904 --> 00:50:27,928
Pia.

312
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:30,564
Pia.

313
00:50:37,481 --> 00:50:38,709
Pia, open the door.

314
00:50:40,684 --> 00:50:42,208
Open the door, Pia.

315
00:50:55,232 --> 00:50:56,256
Pia.

316
00:50:57,334 --> 00:50:59,461
Mirror mirror on the wall.

317
00:51:00,804 --> 00:51:03,136
Nobody loves...

318
00:52:30,201 --> 00:52:32,795
Doctor, how is Pia now?
- She's improving, Mr. Alps.

319
00:52:32,870 --> 00:52:35,304
Water had gone into her lungs.
- And she's pregnant as well.

320
00:52:35,373 --> 00:52:37,204
That's why there were
some complications.

321
00:52:37,775 --> 00:52:38,799
She's in shock.

322
00:52:39,210 --> 00:52:40,575
But I have given her a sedative.

323
00:52:40,979 --> 00:52:42,913
I think everything
will be all right.

324
00:52:42,981 --> 00:52:45,142
We'll keep her here for about two
days, just to monitor her.

325
00:52:45,783 --> 00:52:47,148
And then we'll discharge her.

326
00:52:47,318 --> 00:52:49,582
Everything will be all right.
- Don't worry, okay.

327
00:52:53,992 --> 00:52:55,050
Dad, listen to me.

328
00:52:57,061 --> 00:52:59,052
The doctors can't do anything.
- Stop it, Vic.

329
00:53:01,432 --> 00:53:02,797
How do I explain to you?

330
00:53:03,768 --> 00:53:05,099
It's not what you think it is.

331
00:53:05,803 --> 00:53:07,202
What is that I can't understand?

332
00:53:07,972 --> 00:53:09,735
Dad, it wasn't Pia.

333
00:53:10,942 --> 00:53:12,204
Someone had possessed her.

334
00:53:13,778 --> 00:53:15,075
I've seen it with my own eyes.

335
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:17,004
She needs help.

336
00:53:18,049 --> 00:53:19,516
I don't know how but
she needs help.

337
00:53:21,419 --> 00:53:25,287
Doctors can't cure her.
- You've lost your mind.

338
00:53:26,324 --> 00:53:27,848
She needs to rest.

339
00:53:28,126 --> 00:53:29,286
Please leave her alone.

340
00:53:41,939 --> 00:53:45,807
Why has happiness disappeared?

341
00:53:47,145 --> 00:53:50,080
Why has happiness disappeared?

342
00:53:52,316 --> 00:53:55,308
Why has happiness disappeared?

343
00:53:57,422 --> 00:54:00,391
Why has happiness disappeared?

344
00:54:14,305 --> 00:54:18,799
How do I stop shedding tears?

345
00:54:18,876 --> 00:54:25,213
Not just my eyes but
my heart cries too.

346
00:54:25,283 --> 00:54:30,550
Only I know and so
does my heart.

347
00:54:30,788 --> 00:54:35,282
How I spent my days without you.

348
00:54:35,359 --> 00:54:42,925
No one knows I am standing
at crossroads.

349
00:54:46,070 --> 00:54:53,033
No one knows what I lost,
what I gained.

350
00:54:55,279 --> 00:54:57,770
Why has happiness disappeared?

351
00:55:00,284 --> 00:55:03,947
Why has happiness disappeared?

352
00:55:05,790 --> 00:55:08,088
Why has happiness disappeared?

353
00:55:11,329 --> 00:55:14,196
Why has happiness disappeared?

354
00:55:27,879 --> 00:55:34,751
Someone tell me what am
I being punished for?

355
00:55:35,386 --> 00:55:48,527
Lord, if this is Your will,
I won't give in easily.

356
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:56,807
Why has my world dipped
in darkness?

357
00:55:59,377 --> 00:56:06,840
My days and nights are
spent mourning.

358
00:56:08,386 --> 00:56:11,787
Why has happiness disappeared?

359
00:56:14,091 --> 00:56:16,889
Why has happiness disappeared?

360
00:56:18,930 --> 00:56:21,524
Why has happiness disappeared?

361
00:56:24,235 --> 00:56:26,726
Why has happiness disappeared?

362
00:56:30,875 --> 00:56:34,436
Happiness has disappeared?

363
00:56:34,512 --> 00:56:38,414
Happiness has disappeared?

364
00:56:38,482 --> 00:56:46,321
Happiness has disappeared?

365
00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:51,521
Happiness has disappeared?

366
00:56:51,829 --> 00:56:59,326
Happiness has disappeared?

367
00:56:59,403 --> 00:57:05,899
Happiness has disappeared?

368
00:57:20,358 --> 00:57:21,484
Come on, Roshan, here.

369
00:57:25,029 --> 00:57:26,394
Get it, get it. Get it.

370
00:57:28,933 --> 00:57:30,366
Go left, go left.

371
00:57:41,145 --> 00:57:42,271
Come on. Come on, boys.

372
00:57:46,550 --> 00:57:47,881
Ball, ball. Pass, pass.

373
00:58:23,754 --> 00:58:25,221
I knew you'll surely come here.

374
00:58:27,491 --> 00:58:29,482
She has finally shown her
true self, hasn't she?

375
00:58:31,829 --> 00:58:35,458
Actually, no one believes that
ghosts and spirits exist.

376
00:58:38,069 --> 00:58:39,331
That's what the ghosts want.

377
00:58:40,304 --> 00:58:41,396
That's their game.

378
00:58:43,808 --> 00:58:47,141
But the truth is they
too have a world...

379
00:58:48,112 --> 00:58:49,409
...that's different from ours.

380
00:58:52,783 --> 00:58:54,080
They are with us as well.

381
00:58:55,186 --> 00:58:56,210
All around us.

382
00:58:57,288 --> 00:58:58,880
But we don't see them...

383
00:58:59,990 --> 00:59:01,821
...until they don't want
us to see them.

384
00:59:04,028 --> 00:59:05,290
And when you see them...

385
00:59:06,197 --> 00:59:08,461
...there's surely some
motive behind it.

386
00:59:10,134 --> 00:59:12,364
Aditya, can you help me?

387
00:59:15,039 --> 00:59:16,199
I want to see Pia.

388
00:59:28,419 --> 00:59:29,818
How are you, dear?

389
00:59:53,344 --> 00:59:54,936
Doctor, do something.

390
00:59:55,012 --> 00:59:56,070
Quick.

391
01:00:30,481 --> 01:00:31,971
We've done some more tests.

392
01:00:32,716 --> 01:00:34,445
I will inform you as soon
as we get the results.

393
01:00:35,286 --> 01:00:37,720
By the way,
the symptoms are of epilepsy.

394
01:01:32,943 --> 01:01:34,308
Psychotic epilepsy.

395
01:01:34,712 --> 01:01:35,838
Paranoid schizophrenia.

396
01:01:35,913 --> 01:01:37,005
Hallucinations.

397
01:01:37,448 --> 01:01:40,781
These are all medical terms
to describe possession.

398
01:01:41,952 --> 01:01:44,045
Some things are beyond medical
and science, Vic.

399
01:01:45,389 --> 01:01:48,984
Right now, Pia is in the fourth
stage of possession.

400
01:01:53,764 --> 01:01:57,791
Is Pia's life in danger?
- She can be.

401
01:02:00,771 --> 01:02:02,261
There are five stages
of possession.

402
01:02:02,940 --> 01:02:05,272
Number one, manifestation.

403
01:02:06,944 --> 01:02:08,809
The spirit keeps a
watch on its prey.

404
01:02:15,786 --> 01:02:16,912
Infestation.

405
01:02:17,888 --> 01:02:20,516
The spirit makes its prey
realise its presence.

406
01:02:27,565 --> 01:02:28,759
Oppression.

407
01:02:29,333 --> 01:02:32,496
The spirit wants to keep its
prey away from everyone.

408
01:02:39,410 --> 01:02:40,434
Possession.

409
01:02:41,178 --> 01:02:43,408
The spirit enters
its prey's body...

410
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:45,573
...and tries to fulfil its motive.

411
01:02:52,823 --> 01:02:54,051
And the final stage.

412
01:02:56,060 --> 01:02:57,084
Death.

413
01:02:57,828 --> 01:03:01,161
The spirit kills its prey
and fulfils its motive.

414
01:03:14,878 --> 01:03:16,937
Can we stop Pia from entering
the fifth stage?

415
01:03:18,916 --> 01:03:20,349
Every game has some rules, Vic.

416
01:03:21,085 --> 01:03:22,279
This too has some rules.

417
01:03:22,753 --> 01:03:26,382
Firstly, we've to find out whose
spirit it is. - I know.

418
01:03:28,359 --> 01:03:31,453
Dia. I saw her the other
day at the funeral.

419
01:03:33,430 --> 01:03:35,523
Dia? - Pia's twin sister.

420
01:03:36,567 --> 01:03:38,467
She died in an accident
when she was five.

421
01:03:45,442 --> 01:03:47,569
You know... from the day
we arrived here...

422
01:03:48,479 --> 01:03:50,310
...Pia kept saying,
I can see Dia.

423
01:03:51,582 --> 01:03:52,947
And I didn't believe her.

424
01:03:57,021 --> 01:04:00,957
I think, Vic, you should go back
to the graveyard again.

425
01:04:03,093 --> 01:04:05,823
Maybe there we'll find
out Dia's true motive.

426
01:05:24,875 --> 01:05:25,933
Vic.

427
01:06:38,015 --> 01:06:39,141
'Dia's favourite doll.'

428
01:06:39,883 --> 01:06:41,407
'She would always keep
it with her.'

429
01:06:44,054 --> 01:06:46,249
'We buried this doll
along with Dia.'

430
01:07:22,226 --> 01:07:24,285
'5th June, 1988.
I am very happy today.'

431
01:07:24,361 --> 01:07:26,192
'14th January, Thursday.'

432
01:07:26,363 --> 01:07:28,160
'Pia and Dia have completed
their painting.'

433
01:07:28,232 --> 01:07:29,358
'Lt's Pia and Dia's
birthday today.'

434
01:07:29,433 --> 01:07:30,923
'We spent the entire day
decorating the house.'

435
01:07:31,001 --> 01:07:33,492
'Joe liked it as well... ' -'lt's
Pia and Dia's birthday today.'

436
01:07:33,737 --> 01:07:36,297
'The cake was delicious as well.'
- 'Joe liked it as well.'

437
01:07:36,373 --> 01:07:38,841
How beautiful they look.'
- How beautiful they look.'

438
01:07:38,909 --> 01:07:41,241
'And yet so very different.'

439
01:07:41,445 --> 01:07:44,141
'September 8, 1987.'

440
01:07:44,214 --> 01:07:45,511
'Baked a cake.'

441
01:07:46,216 --> 01:07:48,343
'We also took a video.'

442
01:07:49,052 --> 01:07:52,317
'How I love... ' -'We also took
photos of the birds and trees.'

443
01:07:52,389 --> 01:07:54,050
'They both don't ever
listen to me... '

444
01:08:42,139 --> 01:08:43,834
'Suzan couldn't handle
this incident.'

445
01:08:45,042 --> 01:08:46,100
'She went crazy.'

446
01:08:46,810 --> 01:08:48,539
'And we had to take her
to the mental asylum.'

447
01:09:05,128 --> 01:09:06,152
Oh, Suzan Alps.

448
01:09:06,229 --> 01:09:08,026
I remember this case very well.

449
01:09:08,365 --> 01:09:09,957
She was mentally unstable.

450
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:12,896
In mental terms,
her condition was called OCD.

451
01:09:13,136 --> 01:09:15,195
Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.

452
01:09:16,206 --> 01:09:19,004
When she was brought here,
she wouldn't talk to anyone.

453
01:09:20,043 --> 01:09:22,136
But at times,
she would get very violent.

454
01:09:22,779 --> 01:09:25,270
And it would get very difficult
to control her.

455
01:09:34,391 --> 01:09:35,790
'How is Pia? '

456
01:09:38,962 --> 01:09:40,793
'The mirror can't harm you.'

457
01:09:41,131 --> 01:09:42,462
'We've suffered the loss.'

458
01:09:45,035 --> 01:09:46,468
'I can't endure it any longer.'

459
01:09:48,505 --> 01:09:49,904
'This has to stop.'

460
01:09:50,107 --> 01:09:52,098
'This has to stop.'

461
01:09:54,344 --> 01:09:55,470
'Joe, I am sorry.'

462
01:09:55,712 --> 01:09:57,339
'I... I will have to do this.'

463
01:10:05,756 --> 01:10:07,815
I feel really bad we couldn't
do more for her.

464
01:10:08,091 --> 01:10:09,251
She could've been cured...

465
01:10:09,326 --> 01:10:10,953
...if she was brought here earlier.

466
01:10:11,228 --> 01:10:13,389
What do you mean?
- According to our diagnosis...

467
01:10:13,463 --> 01:10:15,431
...she was already clinically
depressed.

468
01:10:15,932 --> 01:10:17,900
Much before she got here.

469
01:10:18,068 --> 01:10:20,366
She had early signs of paranoid
schizophrenia.

470
01:10:20,937 --> 01:10:22,336
But nobody diagnosed it.

471
01:10:38,221 --> 01:10:40,280
Sir, she wasn't insane.

472
01:11:02,245 --> 01:11:03,769
No matter what the doctors say...

473
01:11:04,214 --> 01:11:06,478
...but she was possessed
by an evil spirit.

474
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:19,089
'She was here. - Who? '

475
01:11:19,830 --> 01:11:20,956
'Dia.'

476
01:11:22,099 --> 01:11:25,125
'Joe, we'll have to stop it.'

477
01:11:26,970 --> 01:11:29,734
'We buried this doll
along with Dia.'

478
01:11:34,811 --> 01:11:36,073
'They too have a world... '

479
01:11:36,847 --> 01:11:38,371
'... that's different
from our world.'

480
01:11:41,985 --> 01:11:44,385
'She was possessed by
an evil spirit.'

481
01:11:52,062 --> 01:11:54,155
Hello. - Sir, your DVD is ready.

482
01:11:54,965 --> 01:11:55,989
Fine, I am coming.

483
01:12:01,538 --> 01:12:03,506
Happy birthday to you.

484
01:12:04,107 --> 01:12:06,268
Happy birthday to Dia.

485
01:12:06,343 --> 01:12:09,005
Happy birthday to Pia.

486
01:12:09,479 --> 01:12:11,379
Happy birthday to you.

487
01:12:12,749 --> 01:12:13,977
Happy birthday to you.

488
01:12:21,391 --> 01:12:22,449
Dia, look here.

489
01:12:22,526 --> 01:12:23,857
Papa, smile.

490
01:12:27,430 --> 01:12:28,522
Pia.

491
01:12:28,932 --> 01:12:30,490
Here, you shoot it now.

492
01:12:31,168 --> 01:12:32,226
Give it quickly.

493
01:12:32,302 --> 01:12:33,462
Careful.

494
01:12:35,305 --> 01:12:37,000
Papa, leave all this.

495
01:12:37,207 --> 01:12:41,041
Come out and play with us.
- No, dear.

496
01:12:41,311 --> 01:12:43,905
Go play with mummy, please. - Okay.

497
01:12:44,814 --> 01:12:46,805
Dia, lets go to mummy.

498
01:12:48,818 --> 01:12:51,184
Mummy, come out and play with us.

499
01:12:51,521 --> 01:12:52,886
Mummy, please come.

500
01:12:52,956 --> 01:12:54,389
Please come, Mummy.

501
01:12:57,394 --> 01:12:59,191
No, not now.

502
01:12:59,262 --> 01:13:00,752
You go, you go.

503
01:13:00,830 --> 01:13:01,956
Go. Go on.

504
01:13:02,199 --> 01:13:04,861
Come on, Dia, let's go out
and play. - Yes, come on.

505
01:13:05,802 --> 01:13:07,064
Dia, quickly.

506
01:13:07,137 --> 01:13:08,536
I am coming.

507
01:13:09,239 --> 01:13:10,467
Dia, leave the camera.

508
01:13:10,540 --> 01:13:13,373
Come near the pool. - No, I won't.

509
01:13:13,777 --> 01:13:15,540
I am scared of the water.

510
01:13:16,913 --> 01:13:18,437
Don't be scared I am there.

511
01:13:21,851 --> 01:13:23,079
Come quickly, Dia.

512
01:13:29,993 --> 01:13:31,051
Come sit.

513
01:13:31,861 --> 01:13:33,123
You aren't scared, are you?

514
01:13:33,797 --> 01:13:35,059
Pia, what are you doing?

515
01:14:21,945 --> 01:14:23,003
Come sit.

516
01:14:24,047 --> 01:14:25,207
Are you having fun?

517
01:14:26,082 --> 01:14:27,310
You aren't scared, are you?

518
01:14:28,918 --> 01:14:30,215
Pia, what are you doing?

519
01:15:05,388 --> 01:15:06,821
Pia loved Dia.

520
01:15:09,959 --> 01:15:11,051
She can't do this.

521
01:15:11,961 --> 01:15:13,360
So, that's why Dia has come back.

522
01:15:14,531 --> 01:15:15,828
To exact her revenge.

523
01:15:19,169 --> 01:15:20,397
But why will she do that?

524
01:15:24,040 --> 01:15:26,167
She said that she wasn't
with Dia that day.

525
01:15:29,979 --> 01:15:31,003
I don't get it.

526
01:15:32,982 --> 01:15:35,416
The return of Dia's doll and
the tape that you found.

527
01:15:38,021 --> 01:15:40,114
Maybe Dia wants to tell
us who killed her.

528
01:15:40,957 --> 01:15:41,981
I can't believe it.

529
01:15:42,792 --> 01:15:44,054
Why will Pia kill Dia?

530
01:15:45,829 --> 01:15:47,126
The bigger question is...

531
01:15:48,098 --> 01:15:50,191
...if Dia turned into a ghost
as soon as she died...

532
01:15:50,266 --> 01:15:52,131
...then why didn't she kill
Pia that instant.

533
01:15:52,902 --> 01:15:54,335
And if she had enmity with Pia...

534
01:15:55,071 --> 01:15:57,164
...then why did she leave Pia
and possess her mother?

535
01:16:00,210 --> 01:16:01,939
This tape tells us only
half the truth.

536
01:16:03,747 --> 01:16:05,374
I think we're missing
out something here.

537
01:16:06,349 --> 01:16:07,907
There's surely something else.

538
01:17:36,739 --> 01:17:38,969
Mummy, come out and play with us.

539
01:17:39,275 --> 01:17:40,833
Mummy, please come.

540
01:17:40,910 --> 01:17:44,505
Please come, Mummy. - No, not now.
- You go, you go. - Go. Go on.

541
01:17:44,747 --> 01:17:47,409
Come on, Dia. Let's go out
and play. - Yes, come on.

542
01:17:52,388 --> 01:17:54,754
Mummy, come out and play with us.

543
01:17:55,024 --> 01:17:56,286
Please come, Mummy.

544
01:17:57,427 --> 01:17:59,759
No, not now. - You go, you go.

545
01:18:00,063 --> 01:18:01,087
Go. Go on.

546
01:18:01,297 --> 01:18:03,891
Come on, Dia. Let's go out
and play. - Yes, come on.

547
01:18:08,271 --> 01:18:11,798
Go. Go on. - Come on, Dia. Let's
go out and play. - Yes, come on.

548
01:18:14,110 --> 01:18:16,738
Come on, Dia. Let's go out
and play. - Yes, come on.

549
01:18:55,785 --> 01:18:58,754
Hello. - Did the mother get
possessed after Dia's death?

550
01:18:59,055 --> 01:19:02,354
Yes. - No,
the mother was already possessed.

551
01:19:05,161 --> 01:19:08,289
Before Dia died? - How do you know?

552
01:19:08,932 --> 01:19:10,490
Watch the DVD carefully
once again, Vic.

553
01:19:11,234 --> 01:19:13,464
And watch the part where
Pia is with mother.

554
01:19:18,708 --> 01:19:20,972
Mummy, come out and play with us.

555
01:19:21,044 --> 01:19:22,170
Mummy, please come.

556
01:19:22,245 --> 01:19:24,110
Please come, Mummy.

557
01:19:25,949 --> 01:19:27,439
No, not now.

558
01:19:27,517 --> 01:19:30,042
You go, you go.

559
01:19:30,787 --> 01:19:32,948
Come on, Dia. Let's go out
and play. - Yes, come on.

560
01:19:39,262 --> 01:19:42,129
No, not now. - You go, you go.

561
01:19:43,199 --> 01:19:45,724
Come on, Dia. Let's go out
and play. - Yes, come on.

562
01:20:05,088 --> 01:20:06,385
Pia was holding the camera.

563
01:20:07,156 --> 01:20:09,454
And she said that she wasn't
with her that day.

564
01:20:10,760 --> 01:20:11,784
That means...

565
01:20:14,764 --> 01:20:16,994
If she's Pia then who is she?

566
01:20:20,103 --> 01:20:22,731
Aditya,
this is someone else's spirit.

567
01:20:23,272 --> 01:20:24,330
You're right, Vic.

568
01:20:24,741 --> 01:20:27,005
Someone else's spirit. But whose?

569
01:20:29,278 --> 01:20:30,438
We're back to square one.

570
01:20:31,314 --> 01:20:32,508
We're back to zero, man.

571
01:20:33,182 --> 01:20:34,979
Vic,
we're still missing out something.

572
01:20:35,885 --> 01:20:37,819
Think carefully,
did you miss out something?

573
01:20:38,087 --> 01:20:40,453
But what? What are we missing?

574
01:20:41,924 --> 01:20:43,255
I don't understand anything.

575
01:20:44,260 --> 01:20:45,284
It's okay.

576
01:20:45,495 --> 01:20:46,985
Its okay, Vic. Don't lose hope.

577
01:20:47,897 --> 01:20:49,228
We've very close to the truth.

578
01:20:50,033 --> 01:20:51,398
Pia's life depends on this truth.

579
01:20:51,801 --> 01:20:53,132
And also of my unborn child.

580
01:20:58,041 --> 01:21:00,168
My whole life depends
on this truth

581
01:21:07,717 --> 01:21:09,446
Come on, Dia.
Let's go out and play...

582
01:21:16,793 --> 01:21:17,817
The diaries.

583
01:21:18,995 --> 01:21:20,292
I will call you back.

584
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:45,251
'I will kill you.'

585
01:21:45,321 --> 01:21:46,845
'I will kill them all.'

586
01:21:49,459 --> 01:21:51,427
'Go away. Go away.'

587
01:21:53,262 --> 01:21:54,422
'Go away please.'

588
01:21:56,132 --> 01:21:57,827
'Go away from here.'

589
01:21:57,900 --> 01:22:00,926
'Somebody help. Help.'

590
01:22:39,242 --> 01:22:40,470
'She's inside me.'

591
01:22:40,543 --> 01:22:41,567
'She's inside me.'

592
01:22:44,147 --> 01:22:46,911
'Baby. My little baby.'

593
01:22:47,550 --> 01:22:50,451
Dear.

594
01:23:06,035 --> 01:23:07,195
Pia!

595
01:23:08,938 --> 01:23:15,537
Papa, you love me, don't you?

596
01:23:20,249 --> 01:23:21,273
Yes, dear.

597
01:23:22,151 --> 01:23:25,348
Papa. You couldn't save mama,
couldn't you?

598
01:23:28,357 --> 01:23:30,825
And now, you can't save me either.

599
01:23:40,303 --> 01:23:41,964
No!

600
01:23:54,784 --> 01:23:56,376
Pia's mother was pregnant
before she died.

601
01:23:58,087 --> 01:23:59,247
She was possessed.

602
01:24:00,289 --> 01:24:02,450
And then that spirit killed
Dia posing as Pia.

603
01:24:04,427 --> 01:24:06,918
And the mother knew that this
spirit would kill everyone.

604
01:24:07,496 --> 01:24:08,861
'We'll have to stop it.'

605
01:24:09,398 --> 01:24:10,922
That's why she killed herself.

606
01:24:12,034 --> 01:24:13,934
And that's why that
spirit possessed...

607
01:24:14,003 --> 01:24:15,265
...Pia when she got pregnant.

608
01:24:16,305 --> 01:24:18,102
Which means that spirit
has returned again.

609
01:24:19,442 --> 01:24:21,034
Vic,
I think this family is cursed.

610
01:24:21,477 --> 01:24:23,377
Whenever a women gets pregnant
in this family...

611
01:24:23,446 --> 01:24:24,743
...this spirit returns.

612
01:24:26,048 --> 01:24:27,538
No child can be born
in this family.

613
01:24:28,050 --> 01:24:29,779
Then how were Pia and Dia born?

614
01:24:30,453 --> 01:24:32,512
The family must be cursed
at that time as well.

615
01:24:33,856 --> 01:24:34,914
Yes, you're right.

616
01:24:36,025 --> 01:24:37,754
Vic, we'll have to meet Pia's dad.

617
01:24:47,169 --> 01:24:49,364
Yes, Vic. - I know you don't
want to talk to me...

618
01:24:49,438 --> 01:24:51,838
...but its very important. - Vic.

619
01:24:52,174 --> 01:24:53,471
I need to meet you right now.

620
01:24:54,777 --> 01:24:56,711
I wanted to ask something
about Dia's mother.

621
01:24:56,779 --> 01:24:58,804
Come to the hospital,
I am right here.

622
01:25:28,077 --> 01:25:29,101
Pia.

623
01:25:29,312 --> 01:25:30,336
Pia.

624
01:25:52,268 --> 01:25:53,428
Pia.

625
01:25:56,505 --> 01:25:59,030
Pia, what are you doing?
- Have you gone crazy?

626
01:26:23,966 --> 01:26:25,399
Dad. - Wait, Vic.

627
01:26:26,035 --> 01:26:28,401
This spirit wants to kill everyone
and make Pia all alone.

628
01:26:31,807 --> 01:26:33,035
We had only one chance...

629
01:26:34,110 --> 01:26:35,771
...but now,
we've lost that as well.

630
01:26:38,214 --> 01:26:39,476
There has to be another way.

631
01:26:40,483 --> 01:26:41,507
There has to be.

632
01:26:42,018 --> 01:26:43,042
Aditya, let's go.

633
01:26:45,187 --> 01:26:46,313
I have an idea.

634
01:27:40,209 --> 01:27:41,540
You must remember something.

635
01:27:41,777 --> 01:27:42,937
Look it's very important.

636
01:27:43,512 --> 01:27:45,036
Anything. Anything at all.

637
01:27:47,016 --> 01:27:48,040
Please.

638
01:27:55,024 --> 01:27:56,321
'She was in intense labour.'

639
01:27:57,226 --> 01:27:59,091
'She was brought in as
an emergency case.'

640
01:28:00,496 --> 01:28:03,761
'Relax, Suzan.' -Suzan, relax.
Everything will be fine.'

641
01:28:04,834 --> 01:28:06,802
'I am there with you.' -'Suzan.'

642
01:28:06,869 --> 01:28:08,894
'And when we took her
in the labour room... '

643
01:28:09,238 --> 01:28:10,796
'... her condition got worse.'

644
01:28:11,474 --> 01:28:12,498
'Push.'

645
01:28:12,842 --> 01:28:14,036
'Carefully. - Push, push.'

646
01:28:14,110 --> 01:28:16,874
'Harder.'
- 'Suzan, push.' -'Push it down.'

647
01:28:16,946 --> 01:28:19,073
'You can do it, you can do it.'
- 'Push. - Push.'

648
01:28:19,148 --> 01:28:20,206
'Harder, Suzan.'

649
01:28:20,282 --> 01:28:22,216
'Yes. - Try.'

650
01:28:24,820 --> 01:28:26,082
Okay, okay. That's great.'

651
01:28:26,789 --> 01:28:27,915
'Suzan, push.'

652
01:28:29,325 --> 01:28:31,156
'Suzan, push. One more time.'

653
01:28:31,460 --> 01:28:35,396
'One more time, Suzan, push.'

654
01:28:36,298 --> 01:28:37,322
'Doctor.'

655
01:28:42,771 --> 01:28:43,863
'The twins are okay.'

656
01:28:44,240 --> 01:28:46,970
'But there are some complications
in your third child.'

657
01:28:48,344 --> 01:28:52,212
'Either I can save your wife
or your third child.'

658
01:28:52,548 --> 01:28:54,982
'You've to take the decision.'
- 'Suzan, doctor.'

659
01:28:55,784 --> 01:28:56,910
'Save her.'

660
01:29:03,125 --> 01:29:04,251
Triplets.

661
01:29:13,102 --> 01:29:14,467
So, Dia wanted to tell us that...

662
01:29:14,703 --> 01:29:18,969
...this is the spirit of her third
sister which was never born.

663
01:29:21,010 --> 01:29:22,238
Now that we know...

664
01:29:22,745 --> 01:29:25,305
...why don't we try exorcism?
- No, Vic.

665
01:29:26,248 --> 01:29:29,513
Trying exorcism now can put
Pia's life in danger.

666
01:29:30,886 --> 01:29:32,410
Right now,
that spirit is very powerful.

667
01:29:32,955 --> 01:29:34,013
She can do anything.

668
01:29:35,024 --> 01:29:37,185
It can be dangerous to lock
horns with her right now.

669
01:29:38,194 --> 01:29:39,218
She's stubborn.

670
01:29:39,828 --> 01:29:41,159
And when children are stubborn...

671
01:29:41,964 --> 01:29:43,898
...it's very difficult
to explain to them.

672
01:29:43,966 --> 01:29:45,365
Then what should we do, Aditya?

673
01:29:54,777 --> 01:29:55,903
Why have we come here?

674
01:29:56,478 --> 01:29:57,843
This is my workshop, Vic.

675
01:29:58,847 --> 01:30:00,439
We've to bring her here
and finish her.

676
01:30:01,016 --> 01:30:03,951
But how? - There's a way.

677
01:31:40,783 --> 01:31:43,377
Until Pia is possessed by that
spirit, we can't harm it.

678
01:31:44,753 --> 01:31:46,448
We'll have to kill her
in the similar way.

679
01:31:48,223 --> 01:31:50,521
Vic, whenever that spirit
wants to kill someone...

680
01:31:51,360 --> 01:31:57,424
...she leaves Pia's body for a
while and goes after her prey.

681
01:31:58,467 --> 01:32:01,265
This time I will be her prey.

682
01:32:03,472 --> 01:32:04,962
And when she comes after me...

683
01:32:05,808 --> 01:32:09,266
...you will place Pia
in this circle.

684
01:32:11,814 --> 01:32:13,008
But remember, Vic.

685
01:32:13,549 --> 01:32:18,543
Under no circumstances will you
bring Pia out of this circle.

686
01:32:19,188 --> 01:32:20,780
Your life can be in danger.

687
01:32:21,957 --> 01:32:24,949
I will be absolutely fine until
this holy water is with me.

688
01:34:59,481 --> 01:35:02,882
'Twins or triplets are like
each other's shadows.'

689
01:35:03,719 --> 01:35:06,085
'Like mirror reflections.'

690
01:35:07,256 --> 01:35:09,281
'And mirrors are the gateway
to the other world, Vic.'

691
01:35:10,425 --> 01:35:11,915
'I will bring that spirit here.'

692
01:35:12,528 --> 01:35:15,520
'And she'll try to repossess
Pia's body.'

693
01:35:17,766 --> 01:35:20,166
'That instant we'll have to
capture her in mirrors... '

694
01:35:20,903 --> 01:35:22,234
'... and destroy them.'

695
01:35:50,999 --> 01:35:54,457
Vic. - Are you okay?

696
01:35:55,904 --> 01:35:59,340
I am fine.
Just bring Pia out quickly. - What?

697
01:36:00,876 --> 01:36:02,810
Will it be okay to bring
her out of the circle?

698
01:36:04,179 --> 01:36:05,441
Pia will be absolutely fine.

699
01:36:06,381 --> 01:36:07,871
I've killed that spirit.

700
01:36:08,984 --> 01:36:10,884
But now,
I need to purify that spirit.

701
01:36:11,320 --> 01:36:12,912
That's why I say get Pia out.

702
01:36:13,322 --> 01:36:14,914
Are Pia and my child
out of danger?

703
01:36:16,491 --> 01:36:17,924
No, they aren't in danger.

704
01:36:24,967 --> 01:36:26,093
Your child.

705
01:36:26,868 --> 01:36:28,927
But has someone ever thought
about that poor child?

706
01:36:31,406 --> 01:36:32,498
What was her mistake?

707
01:36:34,209 --> 01:36:35,301
She had life as well.

708
01:36:36,144 --> 01:36:37,941
She wanted to live as well.

709
01:36:38,347 --> 01:36:39,780
But whose mistake was it?

710
01:36:40,849 --> 01:36:42,942
Anyone would've taken the same
decision at that moment.

711
01:36:43,285 --> 01:36:45,310
Yes, firstly, the father brought
her into existence.

712
01:36:46,188 --> 01:36:51,353
And then when I was waiting
to be born in this world...

713
01:36:52,494 --> 01:36:54,121
...they killed her.

714
01:36:55,697 --> 01:36:57,130
And when she returned...

715
01:36:58,133 --> 01:37:03,264
...her mother deceived her
instead of accepting her.

716
01:37:04,473 --> 01:37:05,940
By killing herself.

717
01:37:11,747 --> 01:37:14,910
They don't have any right
to have children.

718
01:37:18,186 --> 01:37:21,280
That's why whenever anyone gets
pregnant in this family...

719
01:37:22,924 --> 01:37:24,186
...she will return.

720
01:37:25,794 --> 01:37:28,729
There can't be any child
born in this family.

721
01:37:33,135 --> 01:37:35,365
And if anyone tries to stop her...

722
01:37:39,775 --> 01:37:40,901
...she will kill her.

723
01:37:58,493 --> 01:38:01,462
Aditya. - Vic.

724
01:38:02,998 --> 01:38:05,057
Aditya. - Vic.

725
01:38:06,268 --> 01:38:07,701
Vic, I am sorry.

726
01:38:10,038 --> 01:38:13,974
Now,
you've to finish this job, Vic.

727
01:40:12,260 --> 01:40:13,352
Vic.

728
01:40:19,501 --> 01:40:20,729
Vic.

729
01:40:57,706 --> 01:40:58,764
Vic.

730
01:42:27,228 --> 01:42:28,957
You want to kill me, don't you?

731
01:43:12,107 --> 01:43:13,233
Here I am.

732
01:43:15,543 --> 01:43:16,840
Take your revenge.

733
01:46:19,327 --> 01:46:20,487
It's a baby girl.

734
01:47:36,271 --> 01:47:38,865
There's a silence.

735
01:47:40,141 --> 01:47:42,302
Moments of fear.

736
01:47:43,945 --> 01:47:45,913
Who will live, who will die?

737
01:47:45,980 --> 01:47:47,743
Everyone looks terrified.

738
01:47:47,815 --> 01:47:51,251
Everyone is helpless
and shocked.

739
01:47:51,753 --> 01:47:56,122
Everybody's crying,
everybody's screaming for help.

740
01:47:56,190 --> 01:47:57,384
Help. - Help.

741
01:47:57,458 --> 01:47:58,823
Help. - Help.

742
01:47:59,027 --> 01:48:01,325
Who will laugh and who will cry?

743
01:48:02,864 --> 01:48:04,764
Who will lose and who will gain.

744
01:48:06,701 --> 01:48:10,330
Only Lord knows who
will stay together.

745
01:48:10,405 --> 01:48:12,134
Whose footsteps are these?

746
01:48:12,206 --> 01:48:14,265
This darkness is unknown.

747
01:48:14,442 --> 01:48:18,708
Everybody's crying,
everybody's screaming for help.

748
01:48:18,980 --> 01:48:20,379
Help. - Help.

749
01:48:20,448 --> 01:48:21,972
Help. - Help.

750
01:48:22,050 --> 01:48:27,113
Everybody's crying,
everybody's screaming for help.

751
01:48:31,392 --> 01:48:33,292
Wonder what...

752
01:48:33,361 --> 01:48:35,022
Wonder what...

753
01:48:35,096 --> 01:48:40,261
Wonder what's going to happen.

754
01:48:40,335 --> 01:48:42,064
Wonder what...

755
01:49:00,755 --> 01:49:03,349
Somebody help me.

756
01:49:04,759 --> 01:49:08,195
There's something lurking
in the shadows.

757
01:49:08,262 --> 01:49:10,423
Somebody help me.

758
01:49:12,166 --> 01:49:15,260
There's something lurking
in the dark.

759
01:49:16,771 --> 01:49:18,432
Wonder what...

760
01:49:18,506 --> 01:49:20,371
Wonder what...

761
01:49:20,441 --> 01:49:25,777
Wonder what's going to happen.

762
01:49:25,847 --> 01:49:27,712
Wonder what...

763
01:49:27,782 --> 01:49:29,511
Wonder what...
