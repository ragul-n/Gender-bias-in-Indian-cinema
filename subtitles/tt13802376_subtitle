1
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,880
Mr Mehta, hereafter we stop betting,
gambling, liquor...

2
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,040
...and all illegal dealings.

3
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,640
If you wish,
you can buy properties though.

4
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,280
Have you gone mad, Bhau?

5
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,440
From these businesses...

6
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,480
...we earn millions everyday.

7
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,160
This was Devi's wish, Ranjit.

8
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,480
Nothing will be shut for Devi's sake!

9
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,920
I will handle everything.

10
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,920
You! Get up!

11
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,120
Get out!

12
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,240
Wants to buy off the business!

13
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,840
I called him.

14
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,720
With whose permission, Bhau?

15
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,120
Whose permission?

16
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,680
Just hear him out, Ranjit.

17
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,480
You better stay quiet, Ratna.

18
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,080
I've heard enough
rubbish from you Thakurs.

19
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,840
I'm the son-in-law of this family.

20
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,720
Hereafter, all decisions...

21
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,400
...will be taken by me!

22
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,000
No, Ranjit.

23
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,400
Bhau has taken the right decision.

24
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,240
Dad, you!

25
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,240
I'm alive.

26
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,480
You knew this?

27
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,800
Yes.

28
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,480
- Dad, I...
- Quiet.

29
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,320
Now you...

30
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,240
...and Ratna...

31
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,640
...will manage our 5 star hotel in Goa.

32
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,480
Okay.

33
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,560
We'll leave for Goa
tomorrow for a few days.

34
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,240
I will come along.

35
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,920
Understood?

36
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,240
Why?

37
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,560
Sister! What are you doing?

38
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,720
You know his habits.

39
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,160
Has anyone left without eating from here?

40
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,480
Who has come?

41
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Sulaiman,...

42
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,800
...this is 100,000.

43
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,080
Tell Judge Bhatia,
if Anwar isn't released,...

44
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,920
...I'll retrieve the money perforce.

45
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,240
Anwar will be free by Monday.

46
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,920
What about last Monday?

47
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,080
Huh?

48
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,160
It's been two months now.

49
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,480
- Dad!
- Come here.

50
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,720
You haven't slept yet?

51
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,800
I'm scared alone. Come with me.

52
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,800
Mom will come. Go to sleep.

53
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,320
No, I want you.

54
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,800
Okay.

55
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,080
Sit here for 5 minutes.

56
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,920
Sit here and sleep.

57
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,720
Anwar is getting home made food, right?

58
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,920
My wife cooks it.

59
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,560
Shut those curtains, dad.

60
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,560
I'm scared of the lightening.

61
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,800
Coward! Scared of lightening!

62
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,400
You sit, I'll close it.

63
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,000
Dad!

64
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,480
Dad!

65
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,000
What's going on?

66
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,720
Uma!

67
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,320
Go inside.

68
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,480
Oh no!

69
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,560
Dad!

70
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,640
Mr Sawant, come with me.

71
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,800
Tell me, doctor.

72
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,640
He's terribly scared.

73
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,400
Keep him away from this
ambience for a few days.

74
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,720
What did he say?

75
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,080
Devi is terribly scared.

76
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,640
For a few days,...

77
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,720
...send him away from this fearsome life.

78
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,480
Dada, we have a house in Jaisalmer.

79
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Let's send Devi there for a few days.

80
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,720
No.

81
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,480
I'm sending him to Benaras
to his maternal uncle.

82
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,240
Uma will accompany him for a few days.

83
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,920
We'll get him admitted
in a nice school there.

84
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,240
Devi!

85
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,320
Bye.

86
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,720
Get in.

87
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,080
- Anwar!
- Reached!

88
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,800
- Devi left?
- Yes.

89
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,560
He just left.

90
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,800
But, dad, he hasn't returned my 3 rupees.

91
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,000
- I will beat him.
- Come here.

92
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,320
We'll find him, okay?

93
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,800
Take, this is 2 rupees...

94
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,000
...and that's three rupees.

95
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,480
Give it back after Devi pays you.

96
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,720
Okay? Go.

97
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,320
Are you okay, sir?

98
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,320
You didn't eat anything on the flight.

99
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,840
It's my mom's birthday.

100
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Finally, I'll eat her food after 6 months.

101
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,560
Okay.

102
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,400
Would you like to have something?

103
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,840
Have you opened a sari shop, oldie?

104
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,800
Vishwambhar! What's brings you here?

105
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,160
It's my sister's birthday.
I'm here to wish her.

106
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,640
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, Vishwa.

107
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,800
God!

108
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,480
- Thank you, dear.
- These are diamonds!

109
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,640
I can't accept such an expensive gift.

110
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,920
Uma, gifts by your dear
ones have no price tags.

111
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,480
Wear it for the function in the evening.

112
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,800
Kashi!

113
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,800
Get tea for Vishwa.

114
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,400
No, I don't want tea.

115
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,480
You won't have tea?

116
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,000
Before the test,...

117
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,080
...I mustn't have anything.

118
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,800
What test?

119
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,320
High sugar levels.
Diabetes.

120
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,920
Be careful.

121
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,720
Go easy on Scotch too.

122
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,480
How do I do that?

123
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,080
I live for whiskey!

124
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,840
See you in the evening.

125
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,240
Why are you smiling?

126
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,320
Didn't you hear him?

127
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,240
Gifts by your dear ones...

128
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,160
Given a chance,
Vishwambhar can kill his dear ones!

129
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,400
Pari!

130
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,160
Devi is here.

131
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,640
Devi!

132
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,160
Devi!

133
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,800
- Shameless!
- What did I do?

134
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,560
What? You haven't called in 2 days!

135
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,400
But I'm here, right?

136
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,000
You speak as if you did a big favour!

137
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,240
There's something
called surprise, darling!

138
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,320
Go away from here.

139
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,800
Go.

140
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,240
Go away.

141
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,080
- Go.
- Fine.

142
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,560
Hey!

143
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,720
I said leave and you're going?

144
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,560
I'm seeing you after 6 months...

145
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,320
I'm seeing you after 6 months!

146
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,920
I die every minute without you here.

147
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,080
Don't you care?

148
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,840
'On seeing her,'...

149
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,640
...'my face lights up.'

150
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,720
'And she thinks'...

151
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,800
...'her beloved is doing fine!'

152
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,160
What happened?

153
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,640
Not beloved but the
ailing one is doing fine.

154
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,560
- Oh dear!
- It's not easy to decipher Ghalib.

155
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,160
Who wants to?

156
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,160
I died rehearsing these two lines!

157
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,560
I'll teach you!

158
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,800
What do you want in return?

159
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,640
Will you give it?

160
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,240
Try me.

161
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,640
What are you doing?

162
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,800
Leave me!

163
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,160
- Anwar...
- Yes.

164
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,400
Chheda was to give 15 but he gave only 8.

165
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,400
Sir, I called him.

166
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,240
He was pleading on the call...

167
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,400
...saying he's facing troubles
and will arrange soon.

168
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,160
He's acting too smart.

169
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,400
I'll handle him.

170
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,400
You look very pretty today, mom.

171
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,000
Ranjit, Uncle Rana is here.

172
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,240
How are you?

173
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,400
Hello, sir.

174
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,480
Dada, Rana is here.

175
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,160
Is D'costa with him?

176
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,480
Yes.

177
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,400
They're together often these days.

178
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,400
I know.

179
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,080
Look after them.

180
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,800
Yes.

181
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,240
He likes single malt.

182
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,800
I know that.

183
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,000
I heard he gave an expensive
necklace as a gift.

184
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,840
He considers Uma his sister.

185
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,920
He's a snake.

186
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,800
He wants to take over your chair.

187
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,080
You know him well, Anwar.

188
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,400
Dada, Fakira keeps calling.

189
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,640
What do I tell him?

190
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,320
Tell him dad doesn't want to see him.

191
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,560
No, I will meet him, Ram.

192
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,080
But dad,...

193
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,920
...he wants to deal in drugs and you...

194
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,400
...are against drugs.

195
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,640
Ram,...

196
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,800
...a person's work doesn't define him,...

197
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,800
...his thinking does.

198
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,800
We need to know what Fakira is thinking.

199
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,560
Bhau...

200
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,800
...tell him I'll meet him here tomorrow.

201
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,640
Dada!

202
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,000
Please come. Shaila is calling everyone.

203
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,000
It's time to cut the
cake and click a family photo.

204
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,160
Devi hasn't come yet.
Let him come.

205
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,800
Dada, was the flight delayed?

206
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,920
No, he...
What do we say?

207
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,080
There was a stopover.

208
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,720
Meaning?

209
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,080
Anwar knows it well.

210
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,080
Oh c'mon!

211
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,560
- Vishwambhar!
- Kali!

212
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,720
How are you?

213
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,400
Got your single malt?

214
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,800
- Yes.
- How are you D'costa?

215
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,720
- Great.
- And Dandil?

216
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,400
- Enjoying?
- My favourite!

217
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,560
How are you?

218
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,920
Dad, shall we cut the cake?

219
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,720
Let's wait for Devi, dear.

220
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,400
Wonder when Devi will come.

221
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,560
If the party were at uncle Anwar's,...

222
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,920
...he'd be on time!

223
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,080
Right, uncle?

224
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,560
- Let's go.
- Shall we?

225
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,240
It's said,...

226
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,800
...love rendered me useless...

227
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,240
I too used to be worthy!

228
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,000
I too used to be worthy, Uma!

229
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,080
- How are you, aunt?
- I'm fine.

230
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,160
How are you, son?

231
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,240
Devi's here.

232
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,720
Bless you.

233
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,320
Hey!

234
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,920
Pari!

235
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,480
You look very pretty.

236
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,080
- You've grown slim.
- You always say that.

237
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,160
Looks nice.

238
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,640
May no harm come your way.

239
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,560
Pari looks pretty, right?

240
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,560
- Bro!
- Let's take a family photo.

241
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,720
Devi's here too.

242
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,480
- Come.
- Or she'll bore us.

243
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,920
Come.

244
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,240
- Where's the photographer?
- I'm here.

245
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,080
- One second, dad.
- Pari, come.

246
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,640
Devi, let's take a family photo first.

247
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,240
She's also family.

248
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,160
- Come.
- Come, Pari.

249
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,320
- Anwar!
- Yes.

250
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,840
Do you also need an invite?

251
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,400
No, first a family photo...

252
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,640
Let's get them married now.

253
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,800
Join the family.

254
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,800
Stop! No family photo without me...

255
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,080
Just a minute, listen...

256
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,560
5 minutes. Let me get a photo clicked.

257
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,080
I'll give autographs to all.

258
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,920
5 minutes please.
Family photo.

259
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,400
You were taking a family photo without me!

260
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,320
- So good to see you.
- Good to see you!

261
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,480
Forget that. When did you
become Charlie from Chunnilal?

262
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,920
Speak softly!

263
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,320
Don't say Chunnilal.

264
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,800
I'm known as Charlie in the film world.

265
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,000
Charming Charlie.

266
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,320
How are you films doing?

267
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,080
Okay.

268
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,840
They'll be fine. Let's click a photo.

269
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,720
Come.

270
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,920
Gathering of Thakurs.

271
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,080
Everyone smile.

272
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,800
They're clicking a family photograph.

273
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,800
What do you think?

274
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,560
Will Kali let you deal in drugs?

275
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,400
The meeting's tomorrow.

276
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,920
If he wants to click
more such family photos,...

277
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,000
...he will!

278
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,480
Cheers!

279
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,240
Bhau,...

280
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,320
...where's Anwar?

281
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,720
He's unwell, Dada.

282
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,080
I'm Kalidas Bhanudas Thakur.

283
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,000
Why are you joking, Dada?

284
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,320
Who doesn't know you in Mumbai?

285
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,640
I'm Fakira.

286
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,720
Shall we get to the point?

287
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,080
There's a lot of money in drugs.

288
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,400
I know.

289
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,920
I need your blessings.

290
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,240
Fakira, I'm against drugs.

291
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,080
I'll give your 40% share.

292
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,000
Why?

293
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,560
Without your contacts,...

294
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,240
...both police and political,...

295
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,920
...we can't do anything.

296
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,480
Fakira,...

297
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,560
...if I...

298
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,000
...deal in drugs,...

299
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,400
...I'll lose my contacts with the police...

300
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,320
...and politicians.

301
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,800
Dad, if we don't do it,
somebody else will.

302
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,400
I won't stop you from dealing in drugs.

303
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,160
You can do that business, Francis.

304
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,920
Think about it again, Dada.

305
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,160
This business is hugely profitable.

306
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,920
What good is so much money, Fakira?

307
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,320
I eat dal and rice!

308
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,240
Dad!

309
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,840
What if we offer a share
to the police and politicians?

310
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,640
They're a greedy lot!

311
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,400
Ranjit,...

312
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,240
...I have some principles in life.

313
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,000
And dealing in drugs,...

314
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,000
...is against those principles.

315
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,320
Anything else, Francis?

316
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,240
Nothing, Dada.

317
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,320
Thank you.

318
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,480
Ranjit,...

319
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,920
...lies...

320
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,480
...greed...

321
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,720
...and deceit shouldn't give you a high.

322
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,720
Mirrors always tell the truth.

323
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,320
Sorry, dad.

324
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,000
I just thought...

325
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,800
...instead of letting someone else earn,...

326
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,320
...we should earn!

327
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,800
- Idiot!
- Ram...

328
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,320
- When dad talks, shut your mouth...
- Ram...

329
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,000
- Just listen.
- Ram!

330
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,800
No, dad.

331
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,480
It's my fault.

332
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,840
I won't do it again.

333
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,160
Potya.

334
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,560
Yes, Dada.

335
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,160
Keep an eye on them.

336
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,320
Yes.

337
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,800
What's the matter, Uma?

338
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,160
The food is delicious.

339
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,920
I'm sure it's spicy for Devi.

340
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,800
Why?

341
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,720
I'm sure your habits...

342
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,240
...after going there.

343
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,480
I just changed the city,...

344
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,080
...not my habits.

345
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,160
What next?

346
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,000
I just got a job, dad.

347
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,560
I'll have to work at least for a year.

348
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,320
You'll do a job there?

349
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,080
So you'll take orders?

350
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,840
1 plate 'idli', 2 plates 'misal pav'...

351
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,720
I'm a chef...

352
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,920
...not a waiter. I cook.

353
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,720
Ram, he cooked the food today!

354
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,400
Really? Wow!

355
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,560
Why take up a job there?

356
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,640
Why don't you start a hotel?

357
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,640
That requires a lot of money, dad.

358
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,320
So?

359
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,000
Your dad is alive.

360
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,920
That's Singapore.

361
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,400
They keeps tabs on everything.

362
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,480
Where did the money
come from and how much?

363
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,920
All right then,...

364
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,160
...marry some rich girl there.

365
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,320
Besides, I'm sure
you met many girls there.

366
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,320
If he even glances at another girl,...

367
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,000
...Pari will gouge his eyes out!

368
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,720
What have you decided about marriage?

369
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,000
I haven't decided yet.

370
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,400
I'll speak to uncle Anwar.

371
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,800
We'll take loads of dowry from him.

372
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:27,480
He has anyway earned a lot.

373
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,640
A lot!

374
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,400
Dear, even if uncle
Anwar has earned a lot,...

375
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,080
...to save your father-in-law,...

376
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,920
...he got shot twice.

377
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,720
Shaila hates me.

378
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,800
Nothing like that.

379
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,720
I know.

380
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,320
You don't like her either.

381
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:49,920
Can't help it.

382
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,640
One day, I'll give her a befitting reply.

383
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,000
This is what I like about you!

384
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,080
Devi,...

385
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,480
...will we really get married in 6 months?

386
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,080
If I had it my way, I'd marry right away.

387
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,720
Let's do it. The place is holy...

388
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,320
...so are your intentions.

389
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,640
Besides you're looking handsome too!

390
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,400
What's stopping us then?
Let's go.

391
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,480
Do you accept this stubborn,...

392
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,920
...foolish...

393
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,080
...girl who loves you like crazy?

394
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,720
Do you accept?

395
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,400
I do!

396
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:55,440
''I hold a prayer''...

397
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:01,280
...''that is heard by God''

398
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:06,880
''I hold a prayer''...

399
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:13,440
...''that is heard by God''

400
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,400
''My promises are true''

401
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,360
''They're all about you''

402
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:24,720
''I'll keep them forever''

403
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,840
''O my lord!''

404
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:31,040
''O my lord!''

405
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:36,240
''Hear my pleas''

406
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,240
''O my lord!''

407
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:42,480
''O my lord!''

408
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:49,920
''Hear my pleas''

409
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,840
''I've seen all seasons with you''

410
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,480
''be it sunshine or rains''

411
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:07,400
''Have faith in me,''

412
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:13,200
...''that's my only request''

413
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:19,920
''Amidst the lines on your palms''...

414
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,360
...''I lose myself''

415
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:31,720
''O my lord!''

416
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:36,960
''Hear my pleas''

417
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:40,000
''O my lord!''

418
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,120
''O my lord!''

419
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:50,400
''Hear my pleas''

420
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,880
''My eyes''...

421
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,280
...''salute you''

422
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:04,000
''''That's all''...

423
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,680
...''they do day and night''

424
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:13,520
''People love secretly''

425
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:18,960
''while they do it openly''

426
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,760
- ''People love secretly''
- Why have we come here?

427
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:25,000
- Come inside.
- ''while they do it openly''

428
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,680
''People love secretly''

429
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:31,320
''while they do it openly''

430
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,360
''Love...''

431
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,200
Pari, what are we doing here?

432
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:40,360
''while they do it openly''

433
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,560
Tell me.

434
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:45,120
- My mother used to be a dancer here.
- ''O my lord!''

435
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:49,480
''O my lord!''

436
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:56,240
''Hear my pleas''

437
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,160
Hello, uncle.

438
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,840
Hello to you too.

439
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,360
Here's tea for you.

440
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,960
Thank you. Why did you bother?

441
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,640
C'mon, that's no bother!

442
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,080
Should I ask the servants
to serve a family member?

443
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,240
Bless you.

444
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,040
- Tired, right?
- Yes, uncle.

445
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,200
The wedding is 6 months away.

446
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,400
We've to make arrangements, right?

447
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,200
Sir told me.

448
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,080
Well,...

449
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,480
...I too will have to start preparing.

450
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,600
C'mon, why do you worry?

451
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,480
Dad will spend.

452
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,120
Yes,...

453
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,320
...besides...

454
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,880
...everything I have is all thanks to him.

455
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,240
Well, dad said...

456
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,040
...you braved bullets for him?

457
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,960
He's my God.

458
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,320
But your God's relatives...

459
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,960
...are filthy.

460
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:02,280
They said Kalidas chose a
courtesan's daughter for his son!

461
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,600
If I had it my way,...

462
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,520
...I'd slit their tongues.

463
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,840
How dare she say that!

464
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,800
Look Devi, I think she didn't mean it.

465
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,360
No, dad, she intended to humiliate me.

466
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,160
If she says something like that again,...

467
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,600
...I'll kill her.

468
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,960
Pari, you're misbehaving.

469
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,680
- But dad...
- It's Shaila who misbehaved.

470
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,800
She doesn't want me to marry Pari.

471
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,360
Devi!

472
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,160
Calm down.

473
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,080
I want to marry pari before
going back to Singapore.

474
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,880
How's that possible?

475
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,440
We have no time.

476
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,560
We'll go for court marriage.

477
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,040
- Court...
- Pari...

478
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,960
We'll go to the visa
office tomorrow morning.

479
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,360
But my passport will expire in a month.

480
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,840
That will be taken care of.

481
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,520
I think you're acting in haste.

482
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,400
I fear lest it's too late.

483
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,120
Devi!

484
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,160
Come here.

485
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,640
I've something important
to discuss with you.

486
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,160
I'm going to the embassy, dad.

487
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,240
Did you...

488
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,640
...misbehave with Shaila?

489
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,480
- Dad, she...
- Quiet...

490
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:32,480
Devi, I asked you if
you misbehaved with Shaila.

491
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,800
She started it.

492
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,600
Ask her what she did.

493
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,960
That's not my answer.

494
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,200
You misbehaved so right now...

495
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,840
...you will apologise to her.

496
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,480
I did nothing wrong...

497
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,040
...so I won't apologise.

498
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,240
This house follows my rules.

499
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,680
Anyone who objects,...

500
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,800
...may leave the house.

501
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,720
- Brother...
- Listen...

502
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,640
- Brother?
- Devi!

503
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,880
Uma...

504
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,160
...sit down.

505
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,520
Devi!

506
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,680
Devi...

507
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,080
What non sense is this?

508
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,560
Tell that to your wife.

509
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,800
I'll break her legs.

510
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,080
Dimwit keeps wagging her tongue.

511
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,400
Leave that.

512
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,920
Don't stop me, brother.

513
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,640
What rubbish is this?

514
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,360
Look,...

515
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:35,920
...don't mind what dad said.

516
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,040
I'll talk to him.

517
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,880
Listen,...

518
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,040
...I'll tell him...

519
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,320
...you apologised.

520
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,520
I don't want to apologise...

521
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,560
...and I won't.

522
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,320
- Rascal!
- Sorry.

523
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,240
I thought you became
soft after going to Singapore.

524
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,280
But no!

525
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,760
You're a Thakur after all.

526
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,520
Where will you stay?

527
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,000
Any more wedding arrangements needed?

528
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,560
What's to arrange in a court marriage?

529
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,720
We'll dine out.

530
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,240
That's right too.

531
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,720
Do you know something?

532
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,280
The clerk at the registrar's office...

533
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,920
- ...wasn't agreeing.
- Is it?

534
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,120
He objected.

535
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,600
A notice is needed a months
in advance of the wedding.

536
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,160
I offered him some bribe.

537
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,600
He refused...

538
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,240
...saying it's procedure.
Rules are rules.

539
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,680
- Then?
- Then nothing.

540
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,000
I said it's Devidas
Kalidas Thakur's wedding!

541
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,960
He was petrified.

542
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,640
What are you drinking?
Since when do you have girls' drinks?

543
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,840
I don't enjoy hard drinks anymore.

544
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,120
When are you returning?

545
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,560
On the 30th.

546
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,880
Look who's here.

547
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,560
- Don!
- Idiot.

548
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,080
You started without me?

549
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,400
We just started.

550
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,800
What will you have?

551
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,480
You needn't tell me.
Just sit there.

552
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,680
Help yourself.

553
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,320
Look at his attitude.

554
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,040
Devi, marrying on 20th
and leaving on 30th...

555
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,360
Will we get the visa?

556
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,560
Of course.

557
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,600
You have no criminal record like us.

558
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,960
Charlie, I'm taking your bottle.

559
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:18,760
Devi, bye.

560
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,080
Brother...

561
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,560
...what about Pari's passport?

562
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,080
That's why I came here and forgot!

563
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,760
It'll come within 4-5 days.

564
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,040
See you.

565
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,120
Brother, please drop me home.

566
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,360
Come.

567
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,000
Don't go.

568
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,720
What do I tell dad?

569
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,800
I'll tell him you're
with your future husband.

570
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,240
Cheers.

571
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,520
I'll leave too.

572
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:47,800
Where are you going?

573
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,560
Why disturb the love birds?

574
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,080
Enjoy yourselves.

575
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,040
There's no dearth of girls for me.

576
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,680
Enjoy yourselves.

577
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,320
I stayed back, right?

578
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,240
So?

579
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,280
Will you just keep staring?

580
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,640
The first consignment
of cocaine arrives next week.

581
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,680
Fakira, you don't know
about Kalidas' arrogance.

582
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,800
As long as he lives,
selling drugs on a huge scale...

583
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,320
...in Mumbai is tough.

584
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,240
What if he doesn't...

585
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,760
...remain alive?

586
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,200
Can't help it.

587
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,640
Have a seat.

588
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,480
Sit.

589
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,360
- Thank you.
- Why?

590
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,200
For accepting our friendship.

591
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,880
I'm nobody's friend.

592
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,920
I worked for Kalidas
all my life and got zilch!

593
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,840
Now my only friend is money.

594
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,160
What rate have you
decided of Kalidas' death?

595
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,720
50 million.

596
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,600
10 million.

597
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,800
The rest will be delivered
tomorrow morning.

598
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,240
Give me the address. Pen?

599
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,320
Pen?

600
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,960
Pen?

601
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,160
Nice pen.

602
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,280
Francis,...

603
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,920
...this is not a pen but a camera.

604
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,200
He wants to show Kalidas...

605
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,040
...how wretched we are.

606
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,960
Okay, I too want to show you something.

607
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:46,760
Shabbir.

608
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,480
Action.

609
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,040
Devi, wake up.

610
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,640
Wake up.

611
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,560
How come you're here early in the morning?

612
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,880
Bad joke.

613
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,600
It's our wedding. Get up.

614
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,440
I know it's our wedding.

615
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:13,720
What?

616
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,480
I'll die without you.

617
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,840
Is it?

618
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,840
You're my life.

619
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,080
And you're in every breath I take.

620
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,440
Come on.

621
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,960
Get up.

622
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,480
Hello.

623
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,400
Sir, I'm calling from the passport office.

624
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,240
Parveen's passport is ready.

625
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,840
- Good. I'll come right away.
- Okay.

626
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,120
Where are you going?

627
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,440
Your passport is ready.

628
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,720
Get dressed.

629
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,920
We'll go to the passport office
and then to the registrar's office.

630
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,520
Hello! It's an auspicious day for me.

631
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,400
You'll just don pants and shirt.

632
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,640
I've to look beautiful so I'll take time.

633
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,120
Fine, I'll go to the passport office.

634
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,800
Meet me at the registrar's office.

635
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,440
Okay.

636
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,720
Listen...

637
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,480
...if you go after one hour,...

638
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,480
- ...won't you get the passport.
- Nothing like that, why?

639
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,720
You just said I'm your life.

640
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,280
Dumb!

641
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,200
Frolick in the blanket!

642
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,600
You sent for me?

643
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,320
Yes, Bhau. I'm going home.

644
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,720
Dada, Chheda is expected.

645
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,160
Yes, you meet him.

646
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:37,680
The gambling people
are asking more commission.

647
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,960
Increase it to 15%

648
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,040
Home all of a sudden?

649
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,120
Devi is getting married in court.

650
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,800
Uma just called me.

651
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,160
He's angry so he didn't tell me.

652
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,880
We're going to the court.

653
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,720
- Babban!
- Yes, sir?

654
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:55,880
Take the bag.

655
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,320
- 5 minutes.
- What's wrong?

656
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,160
I'll go to the toilet.

657
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,560
I have an upset stomach.

658
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:05,840
Go.

659
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,000
Sorry, you had to wait.

660
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,960
No problem, I'm in no hurry.

661
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,080
Just two more minutes, sir.

662
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:18,880
May I make a call?

663
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,560
You needn't ask, sir, please!

664
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,120
- Hello?
- Hello.

665
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,120
- Got the passport?
- Will get it.

666
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,520
- Are you ready?
- Ready!

667
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,720
You'll be astounded on seeing me!

668
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:32,880
Okay.

669
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,440
Reach the registrar's office.

670
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,720
- Yes.
- Okay.

671
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:44,200
Oh dear!

672
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,880
If you're unwell, give me the key.
I'll drive.

673
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,520
No, I'll manage.

674
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,360
Come.

675
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,160
Where are they?

676
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,760
Now...

677
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,080
Dada, 2 minutes.

678
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,240
May I?

679
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,560
You go and rest. I'll drive.

680
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,880
Okay.

681
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,760
Oh dear.

682
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,280
You...

683
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,880
Stop, rascal!

684
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,360
Dada!

685
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,760
Is that okay?

686
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,840
Sir, there's chaos in the city.

687
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,840
- Kalidas Thakur has been killed.
- What?

688
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,200
Idiot, you can hear me, right?

689
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,040
I want 50 guns right away...

690
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,080
- ...within an hour.
- I won't spare him.

691
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,800
- Hello.
- Hand the phone to brother.

692
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,040
- Don, devi.
- Give.

693
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,480
Hello devi, where are you?

694
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,120
- Come home.
- Is the news about dad right?

695
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,560
It is. That scoundrel D'costa...

696
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:16,280
Listen, Inspector Shinde
said family members should be home.

697
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,400
They'll be safe. Come home.

698
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,520
Where's dad?

699
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,600
Wadia Hospital.

700
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,400
- Why are you home?
- I just came home.

701
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,120
Come back. Our men are there.

702
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,280
Do one thing.

703
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,200
Send someone to the registrar office.
Pari is...

704
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,360
I'll send someone.
Come home.

705
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,280
Hello, Devi!

706
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,400
- Call him.
- Where?

707
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,680
Where do we reach him?

708
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,720
Call the passport office.

709
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,560
Send someone there.

710
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,040
Send someone to the passport office.

711
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,720
We'll get the certificate
in a couple of days?

712
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,880
Yes, don't worry.

713
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,200
What's the time?

714
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,280
Pari,...

715
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,600
...where's Devi?

716
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,160
Perhaps he's stuck in traffic.

717
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:52,080
It's not that far.
He should've come by now.

718
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:55,120
No idea, dad. He asked me
to reach the registrar's office.

719
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,880
Take.

720
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,320
- Sister!
- Yes?

721
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,240
Which room in Kalidas Thakur in?

722
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,120
- I...
- Which room?

723
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,360
I...

724
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,000
Don't be scared. I'm his son.

725
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,040
207, special ward.

726
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,000
- 207?
- Yes.

727
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,440
- Listen.
- Yes?

728
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,320
Where are our men?

729
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,880
The police took them away.

730
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:25,800
Crap!

731
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:53,440
Stop! What are you giving him?

732
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,320
That's...

733
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,720
Painkiller.

734
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,960
Is his blood pressure fine?

735
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,560
- Yes.
- How much is it?

736
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,400
- I'll check.
- It's right there.

737
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,360
Hello, mister! Have you no manners?

738
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,840
Can't you knock and enter?

739
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,000
When you father battles
between life and death,...

740
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,480
...I'll check your manners.

741
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,040
- Look, you can use the phone.
- Shut up.

742
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,320
Who are you?

743
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,400
Devi, where are you?

744
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,640
I'm in the hospital.

745
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:40,680
Did you meet our men?

746
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,440
There's nobody here.
The police took them away.

747
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,360
Somebody tried to attack dad.

748
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,720
Wait there, I'm coming.

749
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,840
Scoundrels!

750
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,080
If anything happens to dad...

751
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,640
Hello, sir.

752
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,320
- Where is he?
- Upstairs.

753
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,520
- Good evening, sir.
- Yes?

754
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,120
- I'm a senior doctor here.
- Okay.

755
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,640
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yes?

756
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,760
My father is admitted here and...

757
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,880
- What's his name?
- Kalidas Thakur.

758
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,480
So?

759
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,040
He has been attacked.

760
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,680
There's no security here.

761
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,520
Is your father some president?

762
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,960
An idiot, a two bit goon...

763
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,160
We should provide him with security?

764
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,720
Speak respectfully, sir.

765
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,320
Or what will you do?

766
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,400
- Speak respectfully, sir.
- What will you do?

767
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:24,880
You'll hit the police?

768
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,400
Move!

769
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,560
For how much were you sold?

770
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,560
What did you say?

771
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,000
- For how much were you sold?
- You...

772
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,320
Your father bought me, is it?

773
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,800
Don't touch him!

774
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:44,000
- I'll shoot you, scoundrel.
- No, brother.

775
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,960
You're aiming a gun at the police?

776
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,480
Stop, sir.

777
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,080
Shinde! What are you doing here?

778
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,440
Sir, the commissioner has given orders.

779
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,800
Kalidas should be given
round the clock security.

780
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,560
So we have to provide
security to these fools now?

781
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:02,240
- Rascal!
- Don't you glare at me!

782
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,880
The day I get a chance,...

783
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,440
...I'll shoot you in
the middle of the street.

784
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:11,000
Lick their boots!

785
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,840
- You're bleeding.
- I'm okay.

786
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,480
We have to shift dad right now.

787
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,120
Sir, be practical. It's not possible.

788
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,200
He needs the life support system.

789
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,360
Shift him with the life support system.

790
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:29,600
Sir, it can't be done.
There's only one system in the hospital.

791
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,360
Two new ones will be here by morning.

792
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,400
Shift him now.

793
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,320
Doctor,...

794
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,480
...how is he doing?

795
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,320
He's in coma.

796
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,800
But his life is not danger.

797
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,720
- Hello.
- Yes, where is he?

798
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:00,040
Ranjit, look who's come.

799
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,760
What are you doing here, uncle Anwar?

800
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,280
Son, I went to the hospital.

801
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:06,280
I got to know they brought sir here.

802
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,080
So, I came to meet him.
How's he doing?

803
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:09,880
He's alive.

804
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,040
Allah!

805
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,200
Thank you, my lord!

806
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:14,880
Thank you.

807
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,000
Where is he?

808
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,520
Listen...

809
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,160
Except family members,...

810
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,840
...nobody can meet dad.

811
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,440
Am I an outsider?

812
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,280
He's my god.

813
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:29,280
You betrayed your god, uncle Anwar!

814
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,640
What did you say?

815
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,840
Are you here because you're worried...

816
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:36,880
...or you fear that he's alive?

817
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,600
Say one more word and I'll kill you.

818
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:40,760
Uncle Anwar!

819
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,160
Who do you want to kill?

820
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:45,760
No...

821
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:49,920
It was mistake, child.
I lost my cool.

822
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,440
If you're back in your senses,...

823
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,720
...please go.

824
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,440
- Uncle!
- Look dear...

825
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,280
- When did you come?
- Just now.

826
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:02,240
- I want to meet sir once.
- Please come.

827
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:04,400
- Yes.
- Anwar can't meet dad.

828
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,360
Uncle Anwar, Shaila.

829
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:14,760
Yes,...

830
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,440
...this uncle Anwar...

831
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:18,960
...just placed a gun on Ranjit's head.

832
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:23,000
It was a mistake. I apologise, dear.

833
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:25,920
Don't embarrass me, uncle.
Please come.

834
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,600
Anwar won't meet dad.

835
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:29,760
I'll break your face, Shaila.

836
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,480
Do it! Break my face.

837
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:34,240
But this traitor won't meet dad.

838
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:35,560
What's going on?

839
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:37,520
Devi!

840
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:39,760
I want to meet sir once.

841
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,400
Shaila won't let me.

842
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,040
Dad is fine, uncle.

843
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:47,720
You go home.

844
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:49,080
I'll call you later.

845
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:50,440
Devi...

846
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:54,400
What are you doing?

847
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:58,120
Let me tell Devi about Ranjit's doing.

848
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,120
Devi was present there.

849
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:02,440
What?

850
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,400
Dad!

851
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,680
Everything happened in his presence.

852
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:10,480
And he said nothing?

853
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:12,280
He said,...

854
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:15,360
...go home.

855
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:30,960
Ram, calm down.

856
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:32,720
By tomorrow morning,...

857
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:35,200
...Fakira and D'costa
should be dead, Bhau.

858
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:39,080
Do what it takes, Anna.

859
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:43,400
Take as much money as you want...

860
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,120
...and as many men you need,...

861
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,880
...I want those two tomorrow.

862
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:49,040
That won't be easy.

863
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:50,760
What?

864
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,040
Listen brother,...

865
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,920
...wouldn't D'costa
and Fakira have thought...

866
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:58,880
...about the consequences?

867
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:04,800
They did this...

868
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,720
...with proper planning.

869
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:09,560
What do we do then?

870
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:11,640
Should we wait like fools?

871
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:13,240
Huh?

872
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:15,280
They will die.

873
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:18,040
Just wait for the right time.

874
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,080
When will that time come?

875
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:26,560
Brother, remember one thing dad said.

876
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:31,120
Every step taken in haste and anger...

877
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:34,880
...leads to death and destruction.

878
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:38,800
Bhau,...

879
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:42,440
...D'costa and Fakira are not so brave...

880
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,440
...to take such a huge step.

881
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,760
Someone from our side is working for them.

882
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:51,240
Bandya!

883
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:53,560
Banda got sold.

884
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,120
He's missing since 2 days.

885
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:57,760
No, Ranjit.

886
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:59,880
Banda was sent by Dada...

887
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:03,800
...to know what Fakira
and D'costa were planning?

888
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:05,320
Tell me one thing, Bhau.

889
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:07,840
Dad had a meeting that day, right?

890
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:09,400
He cancelled it.

891
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:11,200
Why?

892
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,320
He wanted to attend your wedding.

893
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,800
He'd leave suddenly for my wedding.

894
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:25,720
How did they know of it?

895
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:28,080
The moment he came down,...

896
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,280
...he was attacked.

897
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:33,320
Bad luck.

898
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,680
If only Babban wasn't sick that day,...

899
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:43,080
...Dada would've reached
2 hours in advance.

900
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:45,280
What?

901
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:47,560
Who was sick?

902
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:49,120
Babban, our driver.

903
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:52,880
Oh man!

904
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,760
Have some more.

905
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,960
Who could it be?

906
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:06,120
Hi, Manda. How are you?

907
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:07,520
You're here this late, Potya?

908
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:09,400
- I came to check on Babban.
- Yes.

909
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:11,080
- Where is he?
- He's having dinner. Come in.

910
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:12,880
Here he is.

911
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,320
So Babban?

912
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:21,160
What happened?

913
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,600
What happened?

914
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:25,480
Why are you crying?

915
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:27,920
It was all because of me.

916
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:31,640
Dada got shot because of me.

917
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:35,360
My stomach was upset that day.

918
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:36,840
It's okay.

919
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:38,600
What's happened has happened.

920
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:41,160
Dada is fine. Don't cry.

921
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:43,520
Ramdas asked me to check on you.

922
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:44,720
2 days.

923
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:46,640
I'll resume in 2 days.

924
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:48,800
Oh no, you need to rest.

925
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,240
Ramdas said he needs to take rest.

926
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:52,880
Yes.

927
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:55,280
Wow, Manda.

928
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,320
Nice aroma.

929
00:47:58,120 --> 00:47:59,160
Will you have?

930
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:00,640
Why not?

931
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:01,760
I'll get it for you.

932
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:07,640
What did the doctor say?

933
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,960
He gave medicines.

934
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:17,080
Is he allowed to eat chicken?

935
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:20,880
Yes, the doctor said he
can have home made food in limit.

936
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:21,880
- Is it?
- Yes.

937
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:26,800
How's it?

938
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:29,160
It's spicy but nice.

939
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:30,840
I'll get you water.

940
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:38,400
Babban,...

941
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:40,280
...look at your fate.

942
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:44,520
Your stomach got spoilt at the wrong time.

943
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:46,840
If that hadn't happened,...

944
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:49,680
...nothing of this would've happened.

945
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:52,440
That's what I'm saying.

946
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:54,360
My stomach got spoilt.

947
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:58,160
The stomach is the root of all evil.

948
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:09,240
How much did Fakira pay you?

949
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:11,400
Fakira who?

950
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:18,240
How much did Fakira pay you?

951
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:21,120
500,000

952
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,200
500,000 is enough for you to survive...

953
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:35,520
...with ease.

954
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:40,040
You're young. Get married again.

955
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,120
Dada always says...

956
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:51,520
...greed makes a person go crazy.

957
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:53,960
What does it do?

958
00:49:56,840 --> 00:50:00,120
Bhau, Babban wasn't that smart.

959
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:01,520
If he were, he'd be alive.

960
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:07,720
Anna,...

961
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:11,880
...uncle Anwar had hired Babban, right?

962
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:14,520
What are you trying to say?

963
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:18,960
Just that money makes people change, Devi.

964
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:20,440
You talk too much.

965
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:21,520
Go inside.

966
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:24,160
Okay, uncle Anwar is god.

967
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:26,000
Shut your mouth.

968
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:29,880
Why? The truth is bitter?

969
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:31,240
- Shaila, I'll...
- Ram!

970
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:33,040
This is my house.

971
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:34,480
You're misbehaving.

972
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:39,880
Shaila, listen to me carefully.

973
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:42,880
I haven't seen any man...

974
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,560
...more loyal than Anwar.

975
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:51,840
Bhau,...

976
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,600
...any news about Bandya?

977
00:50:58,560 --> 00:50:59,520
What happened, Bhau?

978
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:03,800
Someone sent a photo at home this morning.

979
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:08,080
Whose was it?

980
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:10,040
Beheaded Bandya.

981
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:14,400
- Scoundrels! I will...
- Ram!

982
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:17,200
Control your tongue.

983
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:22,840
Bhau,...

984
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,480
...tell Inspector Shinde...

985
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:27,520
...we want to meet Fakira and D'costa.

986
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:28,600
What will Shinde do?

987
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:31,080
ACP Dayal in the hospital...

988
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,800
...will take our message to him.

989
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:36,280
Tell them, we want to end...

990
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,480
...this bloodshed and enmity.

991
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:42,280
We're willing to listen
all of their conditions.

992
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:44,600
Have you gone mad?

993
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:46,760
We'll befriend those dogs?

994
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:49,120
Unless the snake comes out of the hole,...

995
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,200
...how will we trample it?

996
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:54,080
In that case,
we'll kill them at their hideout.

997
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:56,360
Ranjit, sit down.

998
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,320
Sit.

999
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:01,120
Dad...

1000
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:02,720
Devi,...

1001
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:05,600
...I don't agree.

1002
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:09,200
Ram, if your dad were conscious,...

1003
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,960
...he'd think exactly what Devi has.

1004
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:15,440
Bhau,...

1005
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,000
...talk to them.

1006
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,520
Where had you gone, dear?

1007
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:35,960
Pari!

1008
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:38,120
Why are you crying?

1009
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:43,160
Forgive me, dad.

1010
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:46,080
What happened? Tell me.

1011
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:49,840
I'm pregnant, dad.

1012
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:03,160
Dad, what are you doing?

1013
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,160
I better inform the father of the child.

1014
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:08,080
Dad, the father...

1015
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:10,280
...hasn't called me in 8 days.

1016
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:14,800
Sir is unwell.

1017
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:17,680
You're praying for him day and night.

1018
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:19,360
We're also worried about Dada.

1019
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,960
But am I not his responsibility?

1020
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:35,560
Brother,...

1021
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:41,280
...you're missing Pari, right?

1022
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:47,920
I haven't spoken to her in days, Ratna.

1023
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:51,200
We were to marry that day.

1024
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:54,200
Should I call him?

1025
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:57,320
You know her well.

1026
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:00,320
She won't speak to me.

1027
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:02,920
She must be angry.

1028
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:08,080
Will you bring her here?

1029
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,720
Hello, Anwar.

1030
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:21,360
Hello...

1031
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:23,760
...to you too.

1032
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:27,320
What brings Rana here today?

1033
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:29,680
I came to check on you.

1034
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:31,480
Please sit down.

1035
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:37,280
You thought of me pretty late.

1036
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:43,640
Rana, I'm also in this
business since many years.

1037
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:45,640
And I know very well...

1038
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:47,760
...Rana won't even stir...

1039
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:50,400
...without a motive.

1040
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:56,160
This is what I value about you.

1041
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:57,520
Shall we get to the point?

1042
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:02,760
I heard, the man for
whom you risked your life...

1043
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:06,960
His family humiliated and hunted you out.

1044
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:09,040
Rana, in god's house...

1045
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:12,080
...good and bad people co-exist.

1046
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:13,920
It's okay.

1047
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:15,520
You're a fool.

1048
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:19,640
You were loyal as a dog to Kalidas.

1049
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:21,520
What did you get in return?

1050
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:24,320
A lot more than I deserved.

1051
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:30,760
Listen Anwar,...

1052
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:33,320
...when Kali and I came to Mumbai,...

1053
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:34,720
...we decided,...

1054
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:37,160
...we'll rule over Mumbai.

1055
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:40,960
The moment he got a chance,
he became the king.

1056
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:42,760
And I became the chief.

1057
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:45,520
He was capable of becoming the king.

1058
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:47,160
You know that very well.

1059
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:51,760
You were the biggest
reason he became the king.

1060
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:53,480
What did you get?

1061
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:55,840
Join me.

1062
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:00,680
We'll split what we earn.

1063
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:04,400
I have a principle, Rana.

1064
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:12,240
I don't humiliate my guests.

1065
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,760
Your future generations...

1066
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:20,560
...will enjoy with the wealth we'll earn.

1067
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:23,920
Don't compel me to break my resolve.

1068
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:25,920
Okay.

1069
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:31,360
- One more thing.
- At your own risk.

1070
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:34,200
- I'm used to that.
- Tell me.

1071
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:36,360
You know my nephew Bobby.

1072
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:38,160
Who doesn't know him?

1073
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:40,440
Get Parveen married to Bobby.

1074
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:42,560
Is there a dearth of men in the world...

1075
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:44,480
...to get Pari married to Bobby?

1076
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,240
Think about it.

1077
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:49,960
She will start showing soon.

1078
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:52,560
How will you face the world?

1079
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:55,320
See you.

1080
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:07,320
Jingle bells, jingle all the way.

1081
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:10,320
Santa Claus is coming to
town on a one horse open sleigh.

1082
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,440
Why was uncle Rana at uncle Anwar's?

1083
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:14,840
My sister is always right, Ratna.

1084
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,440
Your family doesn't value her.

1085
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:25,440
Why are you all after uncle Anwar?

1086
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:28,000
Brother, I was there too.

1087
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:30,560
Why did Rana go to meet uncle Anwar?

1088
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:31,960
It could be for anything!

1089
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:36,480
I will hear nothing more on this topic.

1090
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:39,360
Wonder what spell uncle
Anwar has cast on everyone.

1091
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:41,040
- Shaila, shut up!
- Brother...

1092
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:42,440
Brother...

1093
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:45,880
- Anna,...
- Yes?

1094
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:48,080
Bring uncle Anwar here right away.

1095
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:51,360
And Shaila...

1096
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:56,360
...if I get a hint that he's a traitor,...

1097
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:00,120
...I'll kill him right then.

1098
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:01,880
Devi, are you mad...

1099
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:04,120
- Dev...
- Anna.

1100
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:05,080
Okay.

1101
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:12,160
- Hello.
- This is Inspector Shinde.

1102
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:13,840
Wait a minute.

1103
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:16,040
Inspector Shinde.

1104
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:18,720
Bhau...

1105
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:25,680
- Yes, Shinde.
- Bhau...

1106
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:28,480
...tonight at 8 Fakira and D'costa...

1107
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:31,800
- ...will be at D'costa's place.
- Okay.

1108
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:34,080
- And ACP Dayal?
- He'll be there too.

1109
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:36,000
One more thing.

1110
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:40,760
Fakira wants Devidas to
preside the meeting not Ramdas.

1111
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:43,840
Why?

1112
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:46,640
He says Ramdas is hot-headed.

1113
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:48,640
He's emotional.

1114
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:51,400
Devidas is sensible
and will understand things.

1115
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:53,080
Okay.

1116
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:54,760
What happened, Bhau?

1117
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:57,080
What did Shinde say?

1118
00:58:57,720 --> 00:58:59,400
He said, tonight at 8...

1119
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:00,800
...at D'costa's residence...

1120
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:02,720
...D'costa and Fakira will be there.

1121
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:05,640
- We have one hour.
- Potya, get ready.

1122
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:06,800
No, Ram.

1123
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:11,560
They don't want...

1124
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,120
...you in the meeting...

1125
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:15,680
...but only Devi.

1126
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:22,440
Tell them to go to hell.

1127
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:23,680
Brother,...

1128
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:25,920
...if they want me to go,...

1129
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:28,800
- ...I will.
- Devi!

1130
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,840
Brother, don't get involved in this.

1131
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:35,080
This is not your job.

1132
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:38,680
But the one sleeping upstairs...

1133
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:40,480
...is my father too.

1134
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,600
We planned to kill them.

1135
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:46,120
How does it matter...

1136
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:47,880
...whether the older brother
does it or the younger one?

1137
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:57,320
When do we call uncle Anwar? Tomorrow?

1138
00:59:58,440 --> 00:59:59,800
No, Shaila.

1139
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:02,200
Everything will be dealt with today.

1140
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:05,600
Nothing will be carried forward tomorrow.

1141
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:07,720
Anna, Potya,...

1142
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:09,760
...you'll come with me.

1143
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:11,520
Brother,...

1144
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:14,080
...send someone to get uncle Anwar.

1145
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:17,160
I'll go.

1146
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:22,640
What's wrong, Pari?

1147
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:28,040
Dad, I'm scared.

1148
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:35,520
Wonder if Devi forgot us.

1149
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:39,080
Don't think like that, dear.

1150
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:41,880
Devi is a nice man.

1151
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:45,080
He's facing some troubles right now.

1152
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:47,480
Have faith in Allah.

1153
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:52,400
Ranjit?

1154
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:54,560
At this hour?

1155
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:57,200
Devi has sent for you.

1156
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:59,520
Dad, I'll get dressed in 5 minutes.

1157
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:01,680
Only uncle Anwar has been called.

1158
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:07,520
Dad won't go.

1159
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:11,760
I knew it.

1160
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:14,880
- See you.
- I will come.

1161
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:18,800
Wait.

1162
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,800
Dad...

1163
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:24,680
Dad you won't go anywhere.

1164
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:29,040
''Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall''

1165
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:33,400
''Humpty Dumpty had a great fall''

1166
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:12,000
Upstairs.

1167
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:17,760
Dad, please don't go.
I smell a rat.

1168
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:19,120
Dad, please.

1169
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:21,320
Look child,...

1170
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:25,200
...your dad fears nobody but Allah.

1171
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:28,400
I've done nothing to be scared.

1172
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:30,920
But he's wicked, dad!

1173
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:33,320
Don't worry.

1174
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:35,920
I'll be back soon.
Then we'll dine together.

1175
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:56,640
How are you, Devi?

1176
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:02,280
Sit.

1177
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:15,320
How are you?

1178
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:18,400
This is Fakira.

1179
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:19,680
ACP Dayal.

1180
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:21,600
I met him already.

1181
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,120
I'm sorry, Devi.

1182
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:25,000
That was in the heat of the moment.

1183
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:26,920
Don't mind.

1184
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:32,040
Does he have to present here?

1185
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:36,000
Shabbir.

1186
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:52,320
- Tell me.
- Why?

1187
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:54,560
Pure business, Devi.

1188
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:55,640
Nothing personal.

1189
01:03:57,760 --> 01:03:58,840
I'm listening.

1190
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:00,160
Drugs is big money.

1191
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:04,160
Dad didn't stop you from selling drugs.

1192
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:06,920
You know how arrogant your dad is.

1193
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:09,880
This business is impossible
as long as he lives.

1194
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:11,840
Shall we get to the point?

1195
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:13,240
We'll sell drugs.

1196
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:15,360
Dad is still alive.

1197
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:16,720
That's why we sent for you.

1198
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:18,680
Convince him.

1199
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:21,040
We want your unconditional support.

1200
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:23,280
I see.

1201
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:25,040
Unconditional?

1202
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:27,000
20% profit will be yours.

1203
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:29,480
Earlier you offered 40%

1204
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:32,040
Circumstances have changed now.

1205
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:36,200
That means, Thakur family is weaker now?

1206
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:38,920
Yes.

1207
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:40,800
And?

1208
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:44,000
And we want a share of
10% from all your businesses.

1209
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:47,080
We don't need your support, Fakira.

1210
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:48,960
That makes good business sense.

1211
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:51,800
Besides, you called for this meeting.

1212
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:54,520
You don't have a choice.

1213
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:58,560
Don't think much, Devi.

1214
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,240
Seal the deal and end the matter.

1215
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:04,880
And yes, your dad will face no harm.

1216
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:06,560
That's my guarantee.

1217
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:12,600
Brother,...

1218
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:15,040
- ...got light?
- Yes.

1219
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:23,240
Scoundrel.

1220
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:33,640
Uncle Anwar, had you asked...

1221
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:35,760
...Dada would give you money.

1222
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:37,480
Meaning?

1223
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:40,360
Why did you have to...

1224
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:42,800
...take money from dogs
like Fakira and D'costa?

1225
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:45,440
If you weren't sir's son-in-law,...

1226
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:47,080
- ...I'd shoot you right here.
- Sorry!

1227
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:49,080
Sorry.

1228
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:55,520
Johnny Johnny, yes papa...

1229
01:05:55,960 --> 01:05:59,320
Telling lies, no papa.

1230
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,480
Tell me how much you took.

1231
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,240
I'll tell sir what I have to.

1232
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:08,320
He's unconscious.

1233
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:09,720
Nothing will happen to him.

1234
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:12,240
I pray for him 5 times a day.

1235
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:14,560
Oh no! He'll be perfectly fine.

1236
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,920
But will you be alive?

1237
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:26,160
Won't you say anything?

1238
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:28,720
You guys are so predictable.

1239
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:35,000
I thought you'd surprise me.

1240
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:38,640
You'd express regret what happened.

1241
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:42,080
You've realised your mistake.

1242
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:49,040
And I will change my resolve.

1243
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:51,040
Sorry, I was wrong.

1244
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:53,600
All of you are idiots of the first order.

1245
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,000
You...

1246
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:57,280
Relax, Francis.

1247
01:06:59,120 --> 01:07:01,120
Keep talking, kid.

1248
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:04,520
Fakira, I came here with one intention.

1249
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:08,640
To kill all three of you.

1250
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:13,840
You were the mind behind this.

1251
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:17,960
So, I'll shoot you in the head.

1252
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:22,320
D'costa,...

1253
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:25,600
...dad helped you many times.

1254
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:28,240
That drug addict brother of yours...

1255
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:30,080
He was rescued from a molestation case.

1256
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:32,560
He was helped to go to Dubai.

1257
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:36,080
You're ungrateful.

1258
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:39,240
So, I'll shoot you in the chest.

1259
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:41,800
Shabbir!

1260
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:49,480
Devi,...

1261
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:53,320
...we didn't call Ramdas here because...

1262
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:54,840
...he's crazy.

1263
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,400
He doesn't think.

1264
01:07:57,840 --> 01:08:00,000
You were called here because...

1265
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:04,840
...you think about your family's safety.

1266
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:10,720
But you're a bigger fool than Ramdas!

1267
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:13,840
You signed your own death warrant.

1268
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:17,680
Shabbir,...

1269
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:21,240
...kill him.

1270
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:28,760
You can't even harm a hair on my head.

1271
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:33,320
Do you really think you'll survive?

1272
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:35,840
You'll get killed.

1273
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:38,280
And within one week,...

1274
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:41,000
...Thakur family will be wiped off.

1275
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:43,400
D'costa, dead men...

1276
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:45,640
...don't kill.

1277
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:46,840
Stop arguing.

1278
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:49,120
Shabbir, do as you're told.

1279
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:52,880
Listen Fakira,...

1280
01:08:54,040 --> 01:08:55,640
...you bought Babban for 5.

1281
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:57,160
Right?

1282
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:00,760
He was sold for 25.

1283
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:12,480
Stop!

1284
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:20,600
You did right.

1285
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:22,040
Perfectly right.

1286
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:26,000
You did good.

1287
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:27,360
Right.

1288
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:29,160
I told these two...

1289
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:32,040
...not to underestimate your enemies.

1290
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:35,520
But they didn't pay heed.
Overconfident idiots.

1291
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:38,200
But you did right.
I'm with you.

1292
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,120
You did right.

1293
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:42,720
- You want to be rid of the ailment?
- Yes.

1294
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:44,880
Then all viruses should be wiped off.

1295
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:45,960
Indeed.

1296
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:49,440
One virus can also be fatal.

1297
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:50,800
Yes.

1298
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:51,840
- Right?
- Yes.

1299
01:10:58,240 --> 01:10:59,240
Does that hurt?

1300
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:02,480
Look at me.

1301
01:11:02,920 --> 01:11:05,360
Never mess with a Thakur.

1302
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:14,000
Let's go. Get the car.

1303
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:15,720
- Go.
- Sir, my 25,00,000?

1304
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:18,680
My dad says never to go back...

1305
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:20,560
...on one's words.

1306
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:23,000
- You'll get your money in the morning.
- Okay.

1307
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:25,920
He says one more thing too.

1308
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:28,840
Never trust a sold man.

1309
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:33,680
Peter, hurry up.

1310
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:35,360
Take him out.

1311
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:36,640
Take him out.

1312
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:38,600
Hurry up, Peter.

1313
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:40,440
Hurry up.

1314
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:41,600
- Hurry up.
- Yes.

1315
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:45,480
He prayed 5 times for his boss.

1316
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:50,120
Throw him.

1317
01:11:59,240 --> 01:12:00,200
Nice pistol.

1318
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:01,680
Give it to me.

1319
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:06,480
Do you think I'm a fool?

1320
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:10,200
I told you I wanted to meet him.

1321
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:12,840
I'd kill him if he were a traitor.

1322
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:14,840
What could I do, Devi?

1323
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:16,880
He said he wanted to pee.

1324
01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:18,760
He got off and shot Peter.

1325
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:20,520
He was trying to run.

1326
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:21,600
You should've let him run.

1327
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:24,280
You should've let him run.

1328
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:27,080
I was scared, Devi.

1329
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:30,120
What if he'd shoot me?

1330
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:31,360
Then you should've shot him!

1331
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:32,520
What do you want?

1332
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:34,680
My brother should've
died instead of uncle Anwar?

1333
01:12:35,080 --> 01:12:37,200
You want your sister to be widowed?

1334
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:39,040
This is wrong.

1335
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,920
This is wrong.

1336
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:45,800
Dad!

1337
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:50,800
Dad!

1338
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:22,440
Dad!

1339
01:13:32,160 --> 01:13:33,160
Pari...

1340
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:46,040
I mean, you can't go inside.

1341
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:49,560
I said...

1342
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:52,880
Ranjit!

1343
01:14:06,440 --> 01:14:07,920
You rascal!

1344
01:14:10,160 --> 01:14:12,120
You will all die.
All!

1345
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:16,720
I swore upon dad's dead body.

1346
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:20,960
No member of the Thakur
family will remain alive.

1347
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:24,480
Listen Pari, the ones who attacked dad...

1348
01:14:25,320 --> 01:14:27,040
...were friends with uncle Anwar.

1349
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:30,200
He was shot in the back.

1350
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:32,600
He was fleeing after shooting Peter.

1351
01:14:32,680 --> 01:14:34,280
Devidas Thakur!

1352
01:14:34,440 --> 01:14:36,480
I will pray everyday...

1353
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:39,320
...for your dad to come to.

1354
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,440
And when he does,...

1355
01:14:42,280 --> 01:14:43,760
...ask him...

1356
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:47,120
...if dad ever turned his back!

1357
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:51,040
When you'll realise...

1358
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:54,320
...you betrayed my father,...

1359
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:58,440
...I'll finish you all.

1360
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:00,880
Understood, Devidas Thakur?

1361
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:02,720
Listen...

1362
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:05,240
Don't touch me.

1363
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,920
I'm carrying your child.

1364
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:11,920
I swear upon that child,...

1365
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:14,080
...I will kill everyone.

1366
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:15,600
Pari...

1367
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:18,000
Move!

1368
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:42,720
- Hello.
- This is Inspector Shinde.

1369
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,080
Put Ramdas on line.

1370
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:47,840
Don! Shinde's on the phone.

1371
01:15:48,120 --> 01:15:48,920
Yes, Shinde.

1372
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:51,240
Get Devidas out of the house right away.

1373
01:15:51,640 --> 01:15:53,400
- The police will be there to arrest him.
- Why?

1374
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:55,560
He killed a policeman.

1375
01:15:55,640 --> 01:15:57,320
These people won't spare him.

1376
01:15:57,400 --> 01:15:58,960
- Get him out of there.
- Get the car.

1377
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:00,760
- What happened?
- Just get the car.

1378
01:16:01,240 --> 01:16:02,120
Devi!

1379
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:03,080
Devi!

1380
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:16,560
Don?

1381
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:21,400
Bhau!

1382
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:27,040
Anna!

1383
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:29,480
Tell me.

1384
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:31,960
Where is Devidas?

1385
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:34,360
He's not here. He lives in Singapore.

1386
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:36,560
You're acting smart?

1387
01:16:37,160 --> 01:16:38,400
You're acting smart?

1388
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:39,560
- Stand properly.
- Stop, Inspector!

1389
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:43,320
Tell me. Look.

1390
01:16:44,160 --> 01:16:45,280
Here comes your lawyer.

1391
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:46,360
Yes, I am.

1392
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:48,080
I want to see a search warrant.

1393
01:16:50,920 --> 01:16:53,000
I won't show you.
Do what you can.

1394
01:16:53,480 --> 01:16:54,560
Get lost.

1395
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:57,360
You can't go upstairs.

1396
01:16:59,480 --> 01:17:00,440
Dada is sleeping upstairs.

1397
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:02,400
I see.

1398
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:05,200
Your dada is a governor!

1399
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:06,760
Is he a governor?

1400
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:08,360
Scoundrel!

1401
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:09,560
Is he a governor?

1402
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:13,400
Sir, this is not right.

1403
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:24,760
So, the governor is sleeping here.

1404
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:30,280
Where is your son?

1405
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:32,760
He doesn't live here.

1406
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:34,320
He won't live in the world either.

1407
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:37,480
Heard me, governor!

1408
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:40,520
Your son won't live in this world.
Heard?

1409
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:49,040
What are you staring at, oldie?

1410
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:52,440
I'll gouge your eyes out!

1411
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:55,080
Sir, he's not here.

1412
01:17:58,360 --> 01:18:00,400
Even if your son is hiding in hell,...

1413
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:02,440
...I'll find him...

1414
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:04,160
...and chop him into pieces.

1415
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:13,760
- Yadav.
- Sir?

1416
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,160
Make a report.

1417
01:18:16,160 --> 01:18:18,880
This dog impeded police duty.

1418
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:21,960
He attacked the police.

1419
01:18:22,720 --> 01:18:24,000
So,...

1420
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:26,920
...he had to be shot.

1421
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:34,760
I want him.

1422
01:18:36,360 --> 01:18:38,520
I want that rascal.

1423
01:18:39,240 --> 01:18:40,720
Devidas Thakur!

1424
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:42,960
He vanished.

1425
01:18:44,360 --> 01:18:45,480
The police is also looking for him.

1426
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:47,000
I want him before the police nab him.

1427
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:49,720
He killed Francis.

1428
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:52,800
He killed my brother, Rana.

1429
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:57,080
I want to skin him alive.

1430
01:18:58,440 --> 01:19:00,640
One man can help us.

1431
01:19:02,440 --> 01:19:04,160
But he's greedy.

1432
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:06,080
Potya is fine now.

1433
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:07,760
He's out on bail.

1434
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:09,680
- Is his leg okay?
- Yes.

1435
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:12,160
The doctor said he can
walk after a month or so.

1436
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:13,560
I want to talk to him.

1437
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:15,360
Is the police still harassing?

1438
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:17,200
No,...

1439
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:19,120
...Bhau spoke to the commissioner.

1440
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:20,800
Okay.

1441
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:25,480
- Are you fine?
- Yes.

1442
01:19:27,720 --> 01:19:29,600
- Ratna, Pari...
- No, brother.

1443
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:33,600
Pari's phone is still not working.

1444
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:37,520
Do you want to talk to mom?

1445
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:39,360
No. I spoke yesterday.

1446
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:41,080
She starts crying.

1447
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:43,040
- I want to talk.
- Take care.

1448
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:44,360
- You too.,
- Bye.

1449
01:19:44,760 --> 01:19:46,080
Give me.

1450
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:48,840
Why did you hang up?

1451
01:19:49,480 --> 01:19:50,560
I wanted to talk.

1452
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:52,320
Sorry.

1453
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:53,960
I said I want to talk.

1454
01:19:55,240 --> 01:19:56,320
The phone is tapped, Ranjit.

1455
01:19:57,160 --> 01:19:58,200
I see.

1456
01:19:58,720 --> 01:20:00,200
There's no danger if you talk.

1457
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:01,840
But there's a problem if I talk.

1458
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:03,360
Call him back.

1459
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:05,640
It was satellite call.

1460
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:06,760
We can't call back.

1461
01:20:09,080 --> 01:20:10,040
Everyone in this family...

1462
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,160
...treats me like an outsider?

1463
01:20:12,280 --> 01:20:13,640
It's not like that, Ranjit.

1464
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:17,400
Sorry.

1465
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:20,200
Talk to him tomorrow, okay?

1466
01:20:21,200 --> 01:20:22,320
Where is he?

1467
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:29,040
Mr Pandey, mom says...

1468
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:31,160
...you've great favours
for the Thakur family.

1469
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:33,600
Don't embarrass me.

1470
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:34,840
I am alive...

1471
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:36,520
...all thanks to your dad.

1472
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:39,720
Well, how is he faring?

1473
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:42,160
He's still in coma.

1474
01:20:48,520 --> 01:20:50,040
What about the police?

1475
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:52,960
They're still harassing.

1476
01:20:54,920 --> 01:20:56,360
I'll tell you one thing, Devi.

1477
01:20:56,440 --> 01:20:58,240
Rana is your real enemy.

1478
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:01,720
If Rana had it his way,...

1479
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:04,240
...he'll attack us here as well.

1480
01:22:32,440 --> 01:22:33,720
Uma!

1481
01:22:34,040 --> 01:22:35,920
Madam, sir came to.

1482
01:22:36,680 --> 01:22:39,280
Ranjit, brother, Shaila, come quick.

1483
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:49,960
Dad!

1484
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:03,720
Devi?

1485
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:10,440
Dad, you were attacked...

1486
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:11,960
...by Fakira and D'costa.

1487
01:23:14,440 --> 01:23:15,720
ACP...

1488
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:17,080
...Dayal was in cahoots with them.

1489
01:23:20,720 --> 01:23:22,000
All three have been killed.

1490
01:23:25,680 --> 01:23:26,800
Where is Devi?

1491
01:23:31,320 --> 01:23:33,120
Devi killed them.

1492
01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:46,400
Dad!

1493
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:48,560
ACP Dayal was a horrible man.

1494
01:23:48,920 --> 01:23:50,720
But he was a police officer.

1495
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:54,080
If we pardon a man who
killed a police officer,...

1496
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:56,600
...the entire department will be at risk.

1497
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,600
Today his son dared to do this,
soon someone else will too.

1498
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:01,280
Commissioner,...

1499
01:24:02,720 --> 01:24:04,040
...my son made a mistake.

1500
01:24:06,280 --> 01:24:07,280
Can't help it.

1501
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:10,680
A son couldn't control his emotions.

1502
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:14,640
Please do something.
I want to bring my son back.

1503
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:16,360
Kalidas, look...

1504
01:24:16,440 --> 01:24:17,920
I'm willing to pay any price.

1505
01:24:20,160 --> 01:24:22,320
Sounds difficult.
I don't know.

1506
01:24:29,680 --> 01:24:30,600
Commissioner,...

1507
01:24:31,160 --> 01:24:32,120
Not possible.

1508
01:24:32,440 --> 01:24:33,320
Do something.

1509
01:24:36,160 --> 01:24:37,640
Okay, 40 million.

1510
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:41,360
40 million?

1511
01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:42,440
Final, 35.

1512
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:43,760
Commissioner,...

1513
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:47,840
...my son's life is not that cheap.

1514
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:51,240
I'll give 50 million.

1515
01:24:53,400 --> 01:24:54,760
But once he comes back,...

1516
01:24:55,320 --> 01:24:56,800
...he should face no harm.

1517
01:24:58,520 --> 01:24:59,360
Look Kali,...

1518
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:01,200
...the police won't even touch him.

1519
01:25:01,280 --> 01:25:02,240
But what about D'costa?

1520
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:05,400
Will he spare him?

1521
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:07,600
Whatever happened was wrong.

1522
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:12,200
That has affected our business.

1523
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:15,640
This has to end at the soonest.

1524
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:19,320
Kalidas wants to speak to all.

1525
01:25:23,080 --> 01:25:24,440
On behalf of my son...

1526
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:27,840
...I apologise to all.

1527
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:30,840
Ronnie, what happened to your brother...

1528
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:33,600
...was wrong but...

1529
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:36,640
...it was started
by your brother Francis...

1530
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:38,200
...and Fakira.

1531
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:42,000
But I'm willing to forget it all.

1532
01:25:43,560 --> 01:25:44,840
For the business of drugs,...

1533
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:47,240
...I'm willing to offer any help...

1534
01:25:48,440 --> 01:25:49,680
...I can.

1535
01:25:50,360 --> 01:25:51,560
Kalidas,...

1536
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:53,960
...to hell with you!

1537
01:25:54,040 --> 01:25:55,480
Rascal!

1538
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:57,200
Ramdas, Ronnie!

1539
01:25:58,040 --> 01:26:00,720
We're here to reconcile.

1540
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:02,480
There will be no reconciliation,
uncle Rana.

1541
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:05,120
Kalidas,...

1542
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:07,320
...we'll sell drugs.

1543
01:26:08,160 --> 01:26:09,760
We need nobody's support.

1544
01:26:11,440 --> 01:26:12,600
I know only one thing.

1545
01:26:13,240 --> 01:26:14,760
Devidas killed my brother.

1546
01:26:15,560 --> 01:26:16,640
So he will die.

1547
01:26:17,800 --> 01:26:18,760
Look Ronnie,...

1548
01:26:19,080 --> 01:26:20,560
...that means a loss for us.

1549
01:26:20,680 --> 01:26:22,520
I don't care. Devidas won't be alive.

1550
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:24,080
- Shut up, Polly.
- I won't.

1551
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:25,920
That dog got away in Rajasthan.

1552
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:27,080
He won't this time around.

1553
01:26:28,160 --> 01:26:30,440
Next time, we'll shoot
this oldie and that idiot too.

1554
01:26:30,520 --> 01:26:33,080
Ronnie, he is getting out of our hands.

1555
01:26:33,240 --> 01:26:34,160
I am, what will you do?

1556
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:35,680
Pablo, shut up!

1557
01:26:36,720 --> 01:26:37,760
Look Pablo,...

1558
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:39,120
What?

1559
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:08,400
Does anyone have anything to say?

1560
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:16,960
Kali, call your son back.

1561
01:27:18,680 --> 01:27:19,760
Ronnie,...

1562
01:27:20,520 --> 01:27:22,640
...Kalidas will help
you with the drugs business.

1563
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:25,480
In exchange, Ronnie...

1564
01:27:26,360 --> 01:27:27,880
...will give him a 20% share.

1565
01:27:28,640 --> 01:27:30,240
From all of Kalidas' business',...

1566
01:27:31,200 --> 01:27:33,760
...all of us will get 20% share.

1567
01:27:34,720 --> 01:27:35,920
Who decided that?

1568
01:27:36,160 --> 01:27:37,200
I did.

1569
01:27:39,160 --> 01:27:40,280
Any objection?

1570
01:27:43,880 --> 01:27:45,000
Thank you.

1571
01:27:46,240 --> 01:27:47,280
Thank you.

1572
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,400
Uncle Rana, you killed him?

1573
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:03,640
It was needed, Ronnie.

1574
01:28:05,400 --> 01:28:06,680
It was needed.

1575
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:50,000
Dad,...

1576
01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:52,280
...Devi.

1577
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:23,320
- Forgive me!
- No, dad.

1578
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:25,480
I'm your son.

1579
01:29:26,280 --> 01:29:27,280
Sit.

1580
01:29:44,240 --> 01:29:45,360
Pari's getting married?

1581
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:48,800
Ram told me.

1582
01:29:49,040 --> 01:29:50,440
Stop her.

1583
01:29:51,160 --> 01:29:54,200
She has sworn to finish
off the entire Thakur family.

1584
01:29:56,920 --> 01:29:59,680
What about the child she's carrying?

1585
01:30:03,200 --> 01:30:05,160
Pari loved her dad as much...

1586
01:30:06,280 --> 01:30:07,960
...as much I love you.

1587
01:30:08,920 --> 01:30:10,440
Dad, this is all...

1588
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:12,600
...Rana's doings.

1589
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:14,800
I know.

1590
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:18,720
He wants to know he's
more powerful than us.

1591
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:21,080
We'll shoot him through his head...

1592
01:30:21,480 --> 01:30:23,560
...and he'll know where he stands.

1593
01:30:23,720 --> 01:30:26,800
Ram, if you want to live long,...

1594
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:28,960
...learn to respect the enemy...

1595
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:30,920
...no matter how weak he is.

1596
01:30:31,800 --> 01:30:33,320
- What are you saying...
- He's right.

1597
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:38,800
We'll shut down all
illegal businesses, dad.

1598
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:39,800
What? Why?

1599
01:30:39,880 --> 01:30:41,400
Because legal makes more money...

1600
01:30:41,920 --> 01:30:42,760
...and it's less risky.

1601
01:30:42,840 --> 01:30:44,760
- But dad, everything...
- Ranjit...

1602
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:51,200
Sawant,...

1603
01:30:52,640 --> 01:30:54,680
...hereafter all decisions
pertaining to business...

1604
01:30:55,880 --> 01:30:57,080
...will be taken by Devi.

1605
01:30:59,800 --> 01:31:02,280
Gradually,
we'll shut down all illegal activities.

1606
01:31:02,360 --> 01:31:04,240
Wow! Then we'll get a visa too!

1607
01:31:04,840 --> 01:31:06,120
Then full family picnic!

1608
01:31:06,680 --> 01:31:08,000
Singapore?

1609
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:11,600
Your husband is an idiot!

1610
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:14,240
I married Ratna thinking that...

1611
01:31:15,080 --> 01:31:16,840
...we'll get control over the business.

1612
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:20,960
Don't you worry, brother.

1613
01:31:22,640 --> 01:31:25,840
I won't give all this up easily.

1614
01:31:28,720 --> 01:31:29,720
What will you do?

1615
01:31:31,440 --> 01:31:32,600
Your husband...

1616
01:31:32,760 --> 01:31:34,240
...is wagging his tail like a dog.

1617
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:39,360
Get a visa and go to Singapore...

1618
01:31:39,560 --> 01:31:41,680
Family picnic!
Idiot!

1619
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:48,840
- Yeah, why not?
- You're very pretty.

1620
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:50,840
You're glowing.

1621
01:31:50,920 --> 01:31:52,760
- I heard.
- Yes, of course.

1622
01:31:55,480 --> 01:31:57,000
Parveen, Devi's here.

1623
01:32:02,440 --> 01:32:04,840
This rascal should not be alive.

1624
01:32:05,480 --> 01:32:10,120
Ronnie, there's a time
and place for everything.

1625
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:12,440
Right time.

1626
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:15,240
One blow...

1627
01:32:16,640 --> 01:32:18,920
...and the entire Thakur
family will be finished.

1628
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:25,600
Congratulations, Parveen.

1629
01:32:34,240 --> 01:32:35,680
Congrats, Pari.

1630
01:32:37,280 --> 01:32:38,600
Thank you.

1631
01:32:41,280 --> 01:32:42,760
- Bobby, congrats.
- Thanks.

1632
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:44,400
- Thank you.
- I'll see you around.

1633
01:32:46,840 --> 01:32:48,800
Hi, I'm Bobby.

1634
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:51,160
Bobby, congratulations.

1635
01:32:51,560 --> 01:32:52,680
Thank you.

1636
01:32:54,320 --> 01:32:55,400
You look pretty.

1637
01:32:58,840 --> 01:33:00,000
There's more good news.

1638
01:33:00,920 --> 01:33:02,120
I'm going to become a father.

1639
01:33:03,200 --> 01:33:04,600
- Bobby.
- Yes, uncle?

1640
01:33:04,680 --> 01:33:05,720
Come here.

1641
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:07,040
I'll be back.

1642
01:33:07,120 --> 01:33:08,320
I'll just come.

1643
01:33:12,080 --> 01:33:13,280
- Yes, uncle?
- Bobby,...

1644
01:33:14,280 --> 01:33:15,600
...Sunny is alone.

1645
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:17,080
I'll just join him.

1646
01:33:21,440 --> 01:33:23,680
I heard Kalidas Thakur came to.

1647
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:26,120
Did you ask him...

1648
01:33:26,920 --> 01:33:27,960
...about dad?

1649
01:33:28,880 --> 01:33:29,880
Look Pari,...

1650
01:33:30,760 --> 01:33:32,840
...even the best of
the men can't resist money.

1651
01:33:33,120 --> 01:33:34,240
Not ones with a conscience.

1652
01:33:35,960 --> 01:33:37,160
I swear upon dad,...

1653
01:33:38,280 --> 01:33:39,600
...I'll feel great peace...

1654
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:41,400
...the day I kill you all.

1655
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:49,960
What are you looking at?

1656
01:33:50,520 --> 01:33:52,160
Devi is handsome, right?

1657
01:33:53,320 --> 01:33:54,600
I'll kill you!

1658
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:04,480
Brother, how much share do we give...

1659
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:06,400
...to the ones handling
our gambling and liquor business?

1660
01:34:06,840 --> 01:34:08,120
How would I know?

1661
01:34:08,200 --> 01:34:09,440
15%

1662
01:34:09,880 --> 01:34:10,960
Make it 25

1663
01:34:11,040 --> 01:34:12,120
That's wrong, Devi.

1664
01:34:12,840 --> 01:34:14,120
They'll get greedy later.

1665
01:34:14,200 --> 01:34:15,640
We'll handle that later.

1666
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,640
Bhau, ask them to own up all police cases.

1667
01:34:22,080 --> 01:34:23,880
They should have nothing
to do with the Thakur family.

1668
01:34:23,960 --> 01:34:26,240
What will we do? Open a grocery shop?

1669
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:29,360
Ranjit, we'll open schools and colleges.

1670
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:31,520
Constructions, hospitals, hotels...

1671
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:32,680
We'll invest in everything.

1672
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:35,000
Bhau,...

1673
01:34:35,160 --> 01:34:36,920
...buy whichever land you can.

1674
01:34:39,400 --> 01:34:41,480
Ask Chunni to open a production house.

1675
01:34:42,440 --> 01:34:43,680
We'll finance.

1676
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:45,800
Yes, and in that film...

1677
01:34:45,880 --> 01:34:47,160
...I'll be hero, okay?

1678
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:49,400
Okay, Bhau?

1679
01:34:50,600 --> 01:34:51,920
Brother,...

1680
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:55,320
...what about the hotel
you were to buy in Lonavla?

1681
01:34:55,640 --> 01:34:57,800
The agreement will be done next week.

1682
01:34:57,880 --> 01:35:00,120
Ranjit, you will run that place.

1683
01:35:00,720 --> 01:35:01,920
I won't run any hotel.

1684
01:35:02,680 --> 01:35:04,080
I want to be where the action is.

1685
01:35:04,160 --> 01:35:05,200
You don't have a choice.

1686
01:35:05,880 --> 01:35:06,920
Of course, I have a choice.

1687
01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:09,400
I'll speak to dad.

1688
01:35:09,480 --> 01:35:11,720
Ranjit, the decision is made.

1689
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:14,160
Don't trouble dad.

1690
01:35:14,240 --> 01:35:15,320
What compulsion is this?

1691
01:35:15,800 --> 01:35:17,400
I won't run a hotel.

1692
01:35:18,160 --> 01:35:19,560
Come here.

1693
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:22,800
Say one more word,...

1694
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:25,240
...and my sister...

1695
01:35:26,120 --> 01:35:27,040
...will be widowed.

1696
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:29,040
Understood, kid?

1697
01:35:33,240 --> 01:35:35,400
What do we do with this fool?

1698
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:36,600
Brother,...

1699
01:35:38,040 --> 01:35:39,240
...get serious now.

1700
01:35:46,200 --> 01:35:47,520
Pari,...

1701
01:35:48,240 --> 01:35:50,440
...I'm going out and
will return after 2 days.

1702
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:52,080
Alone?

1703
01:35:52,400 --> 01:35:53,520
Not alone.

1704
01:35:53,800 --> 01:35:55,120
Sunny is with me.

1705
01:35:56,080 --> 01:35:57,200
You take care of yourself.

1706
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:01,000
- Bye.
- Bye.

1707
01:36:12,280 --> 01:36:13,600
- Nothing much...
- Look gorgeous...

1708
01:36:13,920 --> 01:36:15,800
- What are you doing?
- Charlie.

1709
01:36:15,920 --> 01:36:17,400
My stud is here.

1710
01:36:19,160 --> 01:36:20,760
- You're crazy.
- Introduce me.

1711
01:36:21,400 --> 01:36:22,560
Okay, come.

1712
01:36:24,760 --> 01:36:25,720
How are you, Chunni?

1713
01:36:25,800 --> 01:36:27,360
Charlie!

1714
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:30,760
How's the party going?

1715
01:36:30,840 --> 01:36:32,080
First class, just popped the champagne.

1716
01:36:32,520 --> 01:36:33,760
You're late, I thought you won't come.

1717
01:36:33,880 --> 01:36:35,360
I wouldn't come had you not insisted.

1718
01:36:35,520 --> 01:36:36,400
You know I don't like partying.

1719
01:36:36,480 --> 01:36:37,680
Exactly my thoughts.

1720
01:36:40,760 --> 01:36:42,200
He won't introduce you to me.

1721
01:36:42,280 --> 01:36:43,920
- I'm Chandni.
- Hi.

1722
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:45,080
The heroine of your film.

1723
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:47,160
My film?

1724
01:36:47,280 --> 01:36:48,800
Oh c'mon! Don't be modest.

1725
01:36:49,080 --> 01:36:50,680
Charlie tells me everything.

1726
01:36:54,400 --> 01:36:56,520
Oh my god! No.
He's not my type.

1727
01:36:56,680 --> 01:36:57,520
No...

1728
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:01,520
I've heard a lot about you.

1729
01:37:01,920 --> 01:37:02,920
Didn't that scare you?

1730
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,280
Scared? I'm fascinated!

1731
01:37:07,880 --> 01:37:09,080
Will you keep standing here?

1732
01:37:09,360 --> 01:37:11,560
- Charlie, those girls are waiting for you.
- Of course.

1733
01:37:11,920 --> 01:37:13,160
- Where are you going?
- I'll be back.

1734
01:37:14,160 --> 01:37:15,720
- Chunni!
- Okay...

1735
01:37:16,520 --> 01:37:17,440
Come with me.

1736
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:18,480
I want to talk to you.

1737
01:37:18,960 --> 01:37:20,040
Come with me.

1738
01:37:20,200 --> 01:37:21,360
I want to tell you something.

1739
01:37:22,840 --> 01:37:23,880
What happened?

1740
01:37:24,120 --> 01:37:25,640
Scared to be with me?

1741
01:37:26,680 --> 01:37:28,200
Don't worry, I won't eat you up.

1742
01:37:28,600 --> 01:37:29,720
Very funny!

1743
01:37:31,440 --> 01:37:34,560
Okay, but don't take
this meeting as a joke.

1744
01:37:37,640 --> 01:37:39,200
You believe in love at first sight?

1745
01:37:44,160 --> 01:37:45,480
No.

1746
01:37:46,680 --> 01:37:47,760
Okay.

1747
01:37:47,920 --> 01:37:50,800
That means we'll have to keep meeting.

1748
01:37:52,480 --> 01:37:53,840
You're embarrassing me.

1749
01:37:55,680 --> 01:37:56,920
What will you have?

1750
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:58,320
No minor vices.

1751
01:38:01,640 --> 01:38:03,160
Major?

1752
01:38:06,240 --> 01:38:08,720
- One scotch on the rocks for me please.
- Yes, ma'am.

1753
01:38:09,680 --> 01:38:11,040
Who's that?

1754
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:14,320
The hero of our film.

1755
01:38:15,880 --> 01:38:17,400
Won't you go?

1756
01:38:20,160 --> 01:38:22,520
Why chase a chocolate
boy when I have real man?

1757
01:38:25,720 --> 01:38:27,520
You like to play with fire?

1758
01:38:28,200 --> 01:38:29,560
Love is fire.

1759
01:38:31,360 --> 01:38:33,480
Just don't douse it.

1760
01:38:34,240 --> 01:38:35,440
You're impossible!

1761
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:37,480
Why?

1762
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:40,200
Am I not attractive?

1763
01:38:40,280 --> 01:38:41,480
You are very attractive.

1764
01:38:42,840 --> 01:38:44,280
My body might say yes...

1765
01:38:45,960 --> 01:38:48,800
...but someone else
rules my heart and mind.

1766
01:38:49,760 --> 01:38:51,280
May I know who that is?

1767
01:39:01,320 --> 01:39:02,560
Hello.

1768
01:39:02,640 --> 01:39:05,120
Pari, it's me.

1769
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:10,960
I love you, Pari.

1770
01:39:13,240 --> 01:39:14,680
And I hate you.

1771
01:39:15,280 --> 01:39:16,360
I don't care.

1772
01:39:18,840 --> 01:39:20,480
I want to meet you right away.

1773
01:39:21,640 --> 01:39:23,720
And I want to kill you right now.

1774
01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:26,320
I'll come there.

1775
01:39:27,480 --> 01:39:28,640
Kill me.

1776
01:39:29,360 --> 01:39:30,640
Before I die,...

1777
01:39:30,720 --> 01:39:32,400
...I want to see my son once.

1778
01:39:33,800 --> 01:39:34,840
Bobby's son.

1779
01:39:36,360 --> 01:39:38,760
Ishan Balwinder Rana.

1780
01:39:40,360 --> 01:39:42,520
You'll never see my son's face.

1781
01:39:43,400 --> 01:39:46,280
And he won't light
his father's funeral pyre.

1782
01:39:47,480 --> 01:39:48,080
Well,...

1783
01:39:49,600 --> 01:39:50,880
...at least you admitted...

1784
01:39:51,400 --> 01:39:52,560
...that I am his father.

1785
01:39:53,120 --> 01:39:54,400
To hell with you, Devi.

1786
01:40:05,480 --> 01:40:07,680
I want a new Mercedes.

1787
01:40:07,760 --> 01:40:09,200
Money doesn't grow on trees, Ranjit.

1788
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:10,640
First learn to earn.

1789
01:40:10,960 --> 01:40:12,680
You can't afford to buy a motorbike...

1790
01:40:13,120 --> 01:40:14,320
...and you want an imported car?

1791
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:15,840
Hang up.

1792
01:40:20,080 --> 01:40:22,600
Why do you behave like
this with my brother?

1793
01:40:23,040 --> 01:40:25,080
He wants an imported car!

1794
01:40:25,400 --> 01:40:27,640
Ram, you can talk to lovingly also.

1795
01:40:28,440 --> 01:40:29,480
He's my brother...

1796
01:40:29,560 --> 01:40:32,160
...but you forget he's
your sister's husband too.

1797
01:40:36,080 --> 01:40:37,080
Come out.

1798
01:40:37,400 --> 01:40:38,480
Why?

1799
01:40:38,560 --> 01:40:39,880
Come.

1800
01:40:39,960 --> 01:40:41,320
Come out.

1801
01:40:41,480 --> 01:40:42,720
- Where are you taking me?
- Just come.

1802
01:40:42,920 --> 01:40:44,040
Look.

1803
01:40:46,040 --> 01:40:47,120
What's that?

1804
01:40:47,480 --> 01:40:48,720
It's Raksha Bandhan.

1805
01:40:49,560 --> 01:40:50,760
Ratna's gift.

1806
01:40:51,320 --> 01:40:53,760
Her husband will drive
to the hotel in an imported car.

1807
01:40:54,520 --> 01:40:55,800
You're bad!

1808
01:41:00,440 --> 01:41:01,600
What are you doing, Ranjit?

1809
01:41:02,480 --> 01:41:04,080
Aren't you ashamed
to drink in the morning?

1810
01:41:04,920 --> 01:41:06,160
Get lost.

1811
01:41:09,040 --> 01:41:10,520
Put the bottle down, Ratna.

1812
01:41:11,360 --> 01:41:13,320
You won't drink now.

1813
01:41:13,720 --> 01:41:16,160
Why do you Thakurs order me around...

1814
01:41:16,240 --> 01:41:18,640
...as if I'm your servant?

1815
01:41:18,840 --> 01:41:20,640
Don't do this and that!

1816
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:22,760
That brother of yours...

1817
01:41:23,080 --> 01:41:25,960
If he weren't my sister's husband,
I'd kill that rascal!

1818
01:41:26,320 --> 01:41:28,640
Don't abuse us Thakurs, Ranjit.

1819
01:41:39,880 --> 01:41:42,280
I hit a Thakur. What will you do?

1820
01:41:44,760 --> 01:41:46,440
Don't abuse Thakurs!

1821
01:41:46,520 --> 01:41:47,960
God forsaken rogues!

1822
01:41:54,880 --> 01:41:56,200
What are you looking at?

1823
01:41:58,080 --> 01:41:59,360
You're angry?

1824
01:42:01,200 --> 01:42:02,600
Very angry?

1825
01:42:02,680 --> 01:42:04,080
Lower your eyes!

1826
01:42:19,120 --> 01:42:20,360
Ratna!

1827
01:42:22,320 --> 01:42:23,720
What happened?

1828
01:42:24,400 --> 01:42:26,480
You should've given him an imported car.

1829
01:42:34,040 --> 01:42:35,480
Hello, sir.

1830
01:42:54,360 --> 01:42:55,880
Oaf!

1831
01:42:55,960 --> 01:42:58,120
You hit my sister!

1832
01:42:58,280 --> 01:42:59,960
You hit her?

1833
01:43:01,840 --> 01:43:02,960
Rascal!

1834
01:43:03,080 --> 01:43:04,320
You hit her!

1835
01:43:05,640 --> 01:43:06,920
No...

1836
01:43:07,120 --> 01:43:08,200
No...

1837
01:43:08,320 --> 01:43:11,080
Touch my sister again...

1838
01:43:12,400 --> 01:43:13,680
...and I'll tear you apart.

1839
01:43:14,640 --> 01:43:16,080
I'll tear you apart.

1840
01:43:28,600 --> 01:43:30,200
To finish the Thakurs,...

1841
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:32,400
...Ranjit can help us.

1842
01:43:32,720 --> 01:43:34,800
He's wicked. We can't trust him.

1843
01:43:34,880 --> 01:43:36,080
He's an insider.

1844
01:43:36,160 --> 01:43:39,040
Uncle Rana, tell him. I said...

1845
01:43:39,320 --> 01:43:40,640
...no Ranjit.

1846
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,400
Rana, I'm not here to take orders.

1847
01:43:44,560 --> 01:43:46,600
I wonder if her intentions have changed.

1848
01:43:48,800 --> 01:43:50,320
Or she sympathy for Devidas...

1849
01:43:51,760 --> 01:43:53,080
...arose again?

1850
01:44:00,920 --> 01:44:02,200
I'm Anwar's daughter.

1851
01:44:04,240 --> 01:44:07,240
Next time, the bullet won't hit the glass.

1852
01:44:22,320 --> 01:44:23,360
Who are you calling?

1853
01:44:24,440 --> 01:44:25,400
Ranjit.

1854
01:44:30,840 --> 01:44:32,400
Dada, enough is enough.

1855
01:44:35,080 --> 01:44:37,000
Nobody fears us in the city anymore.

1856
01:44:39,320 --> 01:44:42,440
Last week, two of our
men were killed in a shoot-out.

1857
01:44:43,880 --> 01:44:45,280
That oaf Ronnie...

1858
01:44:45,360 --> 01:44:46,560
I know, Potya.

1859
01:44:47,840 --> 01:44:48,960
But we won't do anything.

1860
01:44:50,880 --> 01:44:51,840
What?

1861
01:44:52,760 --> 01:44:53,720
Yes,...

1862
01:44:55,280 --> 01:44:56,320
...we won't do anything.

1863
01:44:58,080 --> 01:44:59,720
To break their backs,...

1864
01:45:01,640 --> 01:45:02,960
...we'll take help from the police.

1865
01:45:03,040 --> 01:45:04,680
The police will do zilch.

1866
01:45:05,040 --> 01:45:07,040
The new ACP Talpade...

1867
01:45:07,120 --> 01:45:09,000
...licks their boots.

1868
01:45:09,080 --> 01:45:10,840
I spoke to the commissioner, Anna.

1869
01:45:11,040 --> 01:45:12,200
Okay, Dada.

1870
01:45:13,760 --> 01:45:15,040
In the next few days,...

1871
01:45:16,400 --> 01:45:18,320
...some drug dealers will
be killed in an encounter.

1872
01:45:20,440 --> 01:45:21,440
Personally...

1873
01:45:23,240 --> 01:45:24,600
...we'll stay away from gang war.

1874
01:45:27,120 --> 01:45:28,240
We'll fight the elections.

1875
01:45:28,480 --> 01:45:30,000
Oh man!

1876
01:45:30,240 --> 01:45:31,680
Dada, what are you saying?

1877
01:45:32,680 --> 01:45:33,600
Look,...

1878
01:45:34,040 --> 01:45:36,240
...today muscle power isn't everything.

1879
01:45:36,840 --> 01:45:37,880
Political power is.

1880
01:45:38,440 --> 01:45:39,640
Devi is perfectly right.

1881
01:45:41,720 --> 01:45:42,720
I'm ready.

1882
01:45:43,440 --> 01:45:44,600
I would love to contest.

1883
01:45:44,680 --> 01:45:45,760
No, Ranjit.

1884
01:45:46,880 --> 01:45:48,080
Ratna is a better choice this time.

1885
01:45:50,680 --> 01:45:51,720
I understand.

1886
01:45:54,120 --> 01:45:56,480
And then I'll be her secretary.

1887
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:58,120
I'll answer her calls...

1888
01:45:58,400 --> 01:45:59,760
Hello, ma'am is asleep.

1889
01:46:00,440 --> 01:46:01,600
Any message for her?

1890
01:46:02,120 --> 01:46:03,520
Ma'am, will you have tea?

1891
01:46:04,040 --> 01:46:05,200
Water?

1892
01:46:06,520 --> 01:46:08,320
Mary had a little lamb...

1893
01:46:09,080 --> 01:46:10,680
...whose fleece was white as snow.

1894
01:46:10,760 --> 01:46:12,920
And everywhere that Mary went...

1895
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:14,480
...that lamb was sure to go...

1896
01:46:15,480 --> 01:46:16,720
...wagging his tail.

1897
01:46:18,080 --> 01:46:19,440
Whenever a decision is made...

1898
01:46:19,680 --> 01:46:21,920
...I'm treated like a dog.
Why, dad?

1899
01:46:24,160 --> 01:46:25,080
You talk too much!

1900
01:46:25,160 --> 01:46:26,320
Ramdas,...

1901
01:46:26,400 --> 01:46:27,320
...apologise.

1902
01:46:28,720 --> 01:46:30,640
- Dad...
- Ramdas, say sorry.

1903
01:46:34,600 --> 01:46:36,120
Sorry, idiot.

1904
01:46:57,600 --> 01:46:58,960
Marry me.

1905
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:10,480
You know that will never happen.

1906
01:47:12,320 --> 01:47:13,760
You can be my friend...

1907
01:47:15,120 --> 01:47:16,400
...not life partner.

1908
01:47:18,200 --> 01:47:20,120
Chandni, you're the
best girl in the world.

1909
01:47:22,200 --> 01:47:23,760
But alas, I...

1910
01:47:24,600 --> 01:47:25,960
I only love Pari.

1911
01:47:32,480 --> 01:47:35,200
I wish, I pray, may you find a nice man.

1912
01:47:41,680 --> 01:47:43,440
I know you don't love me.

1913
01:47:44,840 --> 01:47:47,600
But you're not naive
to not understand my feelings.

1914
01:47:50,280 --> 01:47:52,200
I won't mention marriage again.

1915
01:48:26,680 --> 01:48:28,080
Hello.

1916
01:48:28,160 --> 01:48:30,840
Hello, it's me Parveen.

1917
01:48:31,120 --> 01:48:32,800
It's not so long yet, my love,...

1918
01:48:33,600 --> 01:48:35,080
...for me to forget your voice.

1919
01:48:36,520 --> 01:48:37,680
I'm happy...

1920
01:48:38,520 --> 01:48:39,800
...you thought of me.

1921
01:48:41,840 --> 01:48:43,240
Love is still alive.

1922
01:48:43,320 --> 01:48:44,840
But you won't be alive.

1923
01:48:44,920 --> 01:48:46,520
I called to warn you.

1924
01:48:47,120 --> 01:48:48,280
The reason behind this sympathy?

1925
01:48:49,440 --> 01:48:50,800
Don't marry Chandni.

1926
01:48:52,160 --> 01:48:54,800
Chandni? Who's she?

1927
01:48:56,080 --> 01:48:58,120
Open the papers and see the photo.

1928
01:48:59,680 --> 01:49:01,320
- Jealous?
- Me?

1929
01:49:03,680 --> 01:49:06,120
If she marries you,
she'll be a widow soon.

1930
01:49:07,480 --> 01:49:08,440
Why are you laughing?

1931
01:49:10,160 --> 01:49:11,280
Don't you believe me?

1932
01:49:12,440 --> 01:49:14,760
Pari, I have only loved you.

1933
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,200
Who do I believe if not you?

1934
01:49:19,440 --> 01:49:20,640
Wipe your tears, Pari.

1935
01:49:21,400 --> 01:49:23,480
Your tears are proof...

1936
01:49:24,120 --> 01:49:26,240
...that you still love me deeply.

1937
01:49:27,280 --> 01:49:29,520
And I still love you endlessly.

1938
01:49:31,480 --> 01:49:32,600
Are you listening, Pari?

1939
01:49:48,680 --> 01:49:49,720
I don't know, mom.

1940
01:49:50,120 --> 01:49:51,440
I called everywhere.

1941
01:49:51,560 --> 01:49:52,920
He hasn't come home since last night.

1942
01:49:54,040 --> 01:49:55,120
I...

1943
01:49:56,480 --> 01:49:58,040
The car's here. Guess he's home.

1944
01:49:58,160 --> 01:49:59,640
I'll call you later.

1945
01:50:07,520 --> 01:50:08,480
Ranjit!

1946
01:50:09,680 --> 01:50:10,760
Where were you?

1947
01:50:12,240 --> 01:50:14,280
I'm talking to you, Ranjit.
Where were you?

1948
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:17,880
You didn't come home last night.

1949
01:50:23,760 --> 01:50:25,920
I'm not answerable to you, baby.

1950
01:50:26,520 --> 01:50:27,680
Get lost!

1951
01:50:33,560 --> 01:50:34,400
Phone...

1952
01:50:34,480 --> 01:50:35,760
Baby, where are you?

1953
01:50:36,600 --> 01:50:37,640
- Baby...
- You left without informing.

1954
01:50:37,720 --> 01:50:38,840
Hey baby, my phone.

1955
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:39,920
I'm missing you.

1956
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,120
It's my darling's call.

1957
01:50:42,320 --> 01:50:43,440
Are you listening?

1958
01:50:55,240 --> 01:50:56,720
Who did you sleep with?

1959
01:50:57,240 --> 01:50:58,480
Yes, I slept.

1960
01:50:59,880 --> 01:51:00,920
What will you do?

1961
01:51:05,280 --> 01:51:06,760
Will you hit me like your brother?

1962
01:51:08,320 --> 01:51:09,920
Enough! How much will you drink?

1963
01:51:14,640 --> 01:51:16,120
Sir, phone.

1964
01:51:17,120 --> 01:51:18,840
- Who is it?
- Ratna.

1965
01:51:19,920 --> 01:51:20,920
At this hour?

1966
01:51:23,240 --> 01:51:24,280
Tell me.

1967
01:51:24,680 --> 01:51:26,240
Brother, he's a rogue.

1968
01:51:28,520 --> 01:51:30,320
He beat me a lot.

1969
01:51:30,800 --> 01:51:32,000
He beat me a lot.

1970
01:51:34,160 --> 01:51:35,200
Where are you going?

1971
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,040
I'll kill your brother tonight.

1972
01:51:38,120 --> 01:51:39,200
Rascal!

1973
01:51:39,320 --> 01:51:40,520
- He's dead.
- Ram!

1974
01:51:45,880 --> 01:51:48,040
How are you driving, oaf!

1975
01:51:48,320 --> 01:51:49,360
Scoundrel!

1976
01:51:49,680 --> 01:51:51,520
Move aside.

1977
01:51:51,800 --> 01:51:53,160
Have you gone mad?

1978
01:52:36,280 --> 01:52:38,880
Rogue, wretch!

1979
01:52:43,440 --> 01:52:46,720
I always knew...

1980
01:52:47,640 --> 01:52:49,920
...you're a bigger rogue than D'costa.

1981
01:52:51,600 --> 01:52:52,680
Can't help it.

1982
01:52:53,680 --> 01:52:54,920
It's business.

1983
01:52:56,880 --> 01:52:58,440
Nothing personal.

1984
01:52:59,720 --> 01:53:02,040
Will you remain alive, idiot?

1985
01:53:02,760 --> 01:53:03,960
Yes.

1986
01:53:05,280 --> 01:53:07,240
Within 10 days, all the Thakurs will die.

1987
01:53:11,920 --> 01:53:13,120
Pari's child too.

1988
01:53:16,480 --> 01:53:18,440
One of your relative wants to meet you.

1989
01:53:18,960 --> 01:53:24,280
Baba black sheep have you any wool?

1990
01:53:26,040 --> 01:53:28,760
Yes, sir, yes, sir...

1991
01:53:28,840 --> 01:53:30,960
...three bags full.

1992
01:53:32,160 --> 01:53:36,840
One for my master and one for my dame...

1993
01:53:37,920 --> 01:53:41,400
...and one for my brother-in-law...

1994
01:53:41,520 --> 01:53:45,200
...who's going to die in pain.

1995
01:53:45,560 --> 01:53:47,600
You'll die a horrible death!

1996
01:53:49,800 --> 01:53:51,600
Horrible death.

1997
01:53:52,160 --> 01:53:54,560
I'll sit on your father's throne.

1998
01:53:55,800 --> 01:53:56,800
Me!

1999
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:58,680
And my widowed sister.

2000
01:54:00,600 --> 01:54:02,440
How many times did you hit me?

2001
01:54:03,640 --> 01:54:05,200
Your hand works a lot.

2002
01:54:12,240 --> 01:54:13,960
Your hand works a lot.

2003
01:54:43,400 --> 01:54:44,680
Dad!

2004
01:54:44,800 --> 01:54:45,760
Dad...

2005
01:54:51,120 --> 01:54:52,120
Dad!

2006
01:54:52,880 --> 01:54:54,120
Rana...

2007
01:54:54,920 --> 01:54:56,160
What has happened?

2008
01:54:56,280 --> 01:54:57,360
Yes.

2009
01:54:57,880 --> 01:54:58,880
Calm down.

2010
01:54:58,960 --> 01:55:00,000
What has happened?

2011
01:55:00,120 --> 01:55:01,720
What has happened? Who did this?

2012
01:55:02,160 --> 01:55:03,360
Sir,...

2013
01:55:04,840 --> 01:55:06,640
My brother-in-law...

2014
01:55:06,720 --> 01:55:08,080
What's this?

2015
01:55:08,160 --> 01:55:09,600
Take him to the crematorium.

2016
01:55:09,680 --> 01:55:10,880
No...

2017
01:55:11,520 --> 01:55:12,320
Dad!

2018
01:55:12,400 --> 01:55:13,760
Shaila and Uma...

2019
01:55:16,040 --> 01:55:17,360
...mustn't see him like this.

2020
01:55:48,720 --> 01:55:49,720
Devi,...

2021
01:55:50,920 --> 01:55:52,520
...all those behind this...

2022
01:55:53,480 --> 01:55:56,120
None of them should be alive.

2023
01:56:06,520 --> 01:56:09,040
The way Ramdas was
killed was terribly wrong.

2024
01:56:11,920 --> 01:56:14,200
15 of our men were killed in an encounter.

2025
01:56:15,600 --> 01:56:17,160
Drugs business was shut down.

2026
01:56:19,360 --> 01:56:20,800
The police weren't behind it...

2027
01:56:22,800 --> 01:56:23,760
...Thakurs were.

2028
01:56:24,760 --> 01:56:27,360
Shooting once in the
head also kills, uncle.

2029
01:56:28,640 --> 01:56:29,920
What's done is done.

2030
01:56:31,800 --> 01:56:34,320
There will be no mistake
on Ramdas' mourning ceremony.

2031
01:56:35,960 --> 01:56:37,040
What are you thinking of?

2032
01:56:38,320 --> 01:56:40,680
When fire ignites,...

2033
01:56:41,200 --> 01:56:43,080
...both dry and wet things go up in flares.

2034
01:56:43,960 --> 01:56:45,320
- Meaning?
- I mean...

2035
01:56:45,960 --> 01:56:46,960
...mom,...

2036
01:56:47,720 --> 01:56:48,600
...Ratna...

2037
01:56:48,680 --> 01:56:50,520
Come, son.
Let's go inside.

2038
01:56:58,760 --> 01:57:00,240
Why don't you go back to Singapore?

2039
01:57:02,440 --> 01:57:03,480
I won't flee.

2040
01:57:08,520 --> 01:57:09,880
They started this war.

2041
01:57:11,880 --> 01:57:14,160
Now I'm obsessed on finishing it.

2042
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,120
Do you think Pari is involved?

2043
01:57:18,400 --> 01:57:19,960
Chandni, you don't know her.

2044
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:22,680
She loves me like crazy.

2045
01:57:24,120 --> 01:57:25,680
But given a chance,...

2046
01:57:26,720 --> 01:57:27,960
...she'll kill me.

2047
01:57:30,480 --> 01:57:32,120
And the way Ram was killed,...

2048
01:57:34,280 --> 01:57:36,440
She will never stoop that low.

2049
01:57:41,960 --> 01:57:44,240
Do you know what saddens me?

2050
01:57:45,520 --> 01:57:46,880
When this game ends,...

2051
01:57:47,320 --> 01:57:49,200
...Pari's sure to get killed by me.

2052
01:57:50,960 --> 01:57:52,560
The earlier movie earned a lot.

2053
01:57:52,640 --> 01:57:54,160
This will earn even more.

2054
01:57:54,600 --> 01:57:55,800
Great fun.

2055
01:57:56,280 --> 01:57:57,760
- Look there.
- What's happening?

2056
01:57:57,840 --> 01:57:59,120
We're changing the seat, sir.

2057
01:57:59,200 --> 01:58:01,080
- What happened?
- It was burnt from behind.

2058
01:58:04,240 --> 01:58:05,520
- Burnt?
- Yes.

2059
01:58:24,800 --> 01:58:27,800
Did Ranjit go in this
car to fetch uncle Anwar?

2060
01:58:28,640 --> 01:58:30,600
That rogue!

2061
01:58:38,400 --> 01:58:41,000
- Hello.
- Dear, this is Uma.

2062
01:58:42,600 --> 01:58:44,680
- Dear...
- Tell me, mom.

2063
01:58:45,360 --> 01:58:47,200
Good to hear you...

2064
01:58:47,920 --> 01:58:49,280
...call me mom.

2065
01:58:51,720 --> 01:58:53,760
I called you because...

2066
01:58:53,840 --> 01:58:56,320
...neither my husband nor son...

2067
01:58:57,720 --> 01:59:00,200
...have the guts to speak to you.

2068
01:59:03,400 --> 01:59:05,920
Brother Anwar was killed by deceit.

2069
01:59:06,360 --> 01:59:10,000
I own up to it on behalf
of the entire Thakur family...

2070
01:59:10,880 --> 01:59:12,600
...and seek your forgiveness.

2071
01:59:15,080 --> 01:59:17,960
The Thakur family is terribly ashamed.

2072
01:59:20,320 --> 01:59:22,840
On hearing this,
you should change your decision.

2073
01:59:24,040 --> 01:59:25,640
I would never say that.

2074
01:59:26,160 --> 01:59:27,400
But dear,...

2075
01:59:27,800 --> 01:59:30,800
...this bloodshed will
only lead to destruction.

2076
01:59:31,480 --> 01:59:33,360
We've lived our lives.

2077
01:59:34,800 --> 01:59:36,520
But you think about your son...

2078
01:59:37,120 --> 01:59:38,400
...and our grandson's...

2079
01:59:38,720 --> 01:59:40,320
...future.

2080
01:59:43,840 --> 01:59:45,320
Think about it, dear.

2081
01:59:49,680 --> 01:59:50,920
The function will be in this hall.

2082
01:59:51,200 --> 01:59:52,760
Our men will be here.

2083
01:59:53,560 --> 01:59:54,760
How will we go inside?

2084
01:59:56,360 --> 01:59:57,560
They will have security.

2085
01:59:59,440 --> 02:00:01,360
Anna's looking the security.

2086
02:00:02,040 --> 02:00:03,960
We got him a great piece of land.

2087
02:00:05,400 --> 02:00:07,000
Ronnie, go ahead.

2088
02:00:07,480 --> 02:00:09,560
Our men will take position tonight.

2089
02:00:10,440 --> 02:00:12,480
When they park in the morning,...

2090
02:00:12,600 --> 02:00:14,440
...bombs will be placed under each car.

2091
02:00:16,880 --> 02:00:18,960
They'll either die here or there.

2092
02:00:19,440 --> 02:00:21,000
Sir, Pari's here.

2093
02:00:22,600 --> 02:00:24,000
- Send her in.
- Okay.

2094
02:00:28,320 --> 02:00:29,840
Come, sit.

2095
02:00:31,760 --> 02:00:33,200
Everything's planned.

2096
02:00:33,520 --> 02:00:35,080
Ronnie.

2097
02:00:36,360 --> 02:00:38,440
Uncle, this attack won't take place.

2098
02:00:39,120 --> 02:00:41,000
What the hell!
Why?

2099
02:00:42,560 --> 02:00:43,960
I just spoke to Uma.

2100
02:00:44,480 --> 02:00:47,080
The Thakur family has
agreed to all our conditions.

2101
02:00:47,680 --> 02:00:49,160
Everything we want...

2102
02:00:49,240 --> 02:00:51,240
They'll forsake all their businesses too.

2103
02:00:51,320 --> 02:00:53,280
What about the death of the Thakurs?

2104
02:00:54,480 --> 02:00:56,120
That was personal enmity.

2105
02:00:56,240 --> 02:00:57,880
This is personal for me too.

2106
02:00:58,880 --> 02:01:00,720
Your lover killed my brother.

2107
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:02,480
So kill him.

2108
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:04,400
I don't care.

2109
02:01:04,920 --> 02:01:06,600
But there will be many people there...

2110
02:01:06,960 --> 02:01:09,360
...who have nothing to
do with your brother's death.

2111
02:01:09,560 --> 02:01:10,880
Why didn't you think of it earlier?

2112
02:01:12,920 --> 02:01:14,280
Things were different back then.

2113
02:01:14,800 --> 02:01:15,880
I don't care.

2114
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:19,160
They will be attacked tomorrow.

2115
02:01:22,520 --> 02:01:24,160
Only if you stay alive.

2116
02:01:27,960 --> 02:01:29,480
Wait a minute.

2117
02:01:34,840 --> 02:01:36,160
Okay, Pari.

2118
02:01:37,640 --> 02:01:39,440
I promise you,...

2119
02:01:39,520 --> 02:01:41,360
...I won't attack.

2120
02:01:43,480 --> 02:01:45,200
Pari,...

2121
02:01:53,560 --> 02:01:55,000
What the heck, Vishwambhar!

2122
02:01:55,640 --> 02:01:56,880
How could you promise her?

2123
02:02:00,360 --> 02:02:02,080
I promised, Ronnie!

2124
02:02:15,440 --> 02:02:16,360
Rana isn't here?

2125
02:02:26,960 --> 02:02:30,400
Dada, Rana called to say he's on the way.

2126
02:02:37,800 --> 02:02:38,800
Dad,...

2127
02:02:39,440 --> 02:02:40,480
...you sit here.

2128
02:02:40,560 --> 02:02:41,360
I'll see.

2129
02:02:51,680 --> 02:02:53,200
Shaila, come with me.

2130
02:02:54,240 --> 02:02:55,160
Where to?

2131
02:02:55,240 --> 02:02:56,680
We've to get things done.

2132
02:02:56,840 --> 02:02:57,760
Dad said so.

2133
02:03:14,160 --> 02:03:15,960
Dada!

2134
02:03:18,720 --> 02:03:20,400
- What's going on?
- Shaila, stop!

2135
02:03:24,080 --> 02:03:25,680
- Devi!
- Come.

2136
02:03:29,760 --> 02:03:31,320
Catch them.

2137
02:03:39,920 --> 02:03:41,800
- You!
- Leave me!

2138
02:03:42,120 --> 02:03:44,040
- Shaila, don't go out.
- Shameless!

2139
02:03:44,120 --> 02:03:45,200
Shaila, stop!

2140
02:03:47,480 --> 02:03:48,560
Shaila!

2141
02:03:50,520 --> 02:03:51,680
Shaila!

2142
02:03:52,480 --> 02:03:54,040
Shaila!

2143
02:04:00,200 --> 02:04:01,760
Shaila!

2144
02:04:02,440 --> 02:04:03,960
Chandni!

2145
02:04:04,280 --> 02:04:05,360
Get the car.

2146
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:08,760
Forgive me, Devi.

2147
02:04:08,840 --> 02:04:10,120
Forgive me.

2148
02:04:10,760 --> 02:04:12,120
I was wrong.

2149
02:04:23,840 --> 02:04:25,640
Chanda, no!

2150
02:04:30,080 --> 02:04:33,000
Dada, Parveen was against
the Thakur family.

2151
02:04:35,960 --> 02:04:38,200
But 14 innocents died there.

2152
02:04:39,440 --> 02:04:41,040
Chandni wasn't a Thakur.

2153
02:04:42,920 --> 02:04:44,280
Parveen was wrong.

2154
02:04:44,440 --> 02:04:47,000
Look, whatever happened that day...

2155
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:51,720
...was because of Rana and Ronnie.
Everyone knows that.

2156
02:04:53,040 --> 02:04:54,360
But they were helped...

2157
02:04:54,800 --> 02:04:56,280
...by traitors...

2158
02:04:57,640 --> 02:04:58,880
...in friendly disguise.

2159
02:04:59,720 --> 02:05:01,800
They have no right to remain alive.

2160
02:05:02,200 --> 02:05:03,960
Finding them is not so easy, ranjit.

2161
02:05:05,200 --> 02:05:06,480
To identify them...

2162
02:05:07,760 --> 02:05:09,120
...and know them,...

2163
02:05:10,480 --> 02:05:12,600
...you'll have to wait till I die.

2164
02:05:18,480 --> 02:05:22,000
Devi, your dad and I...

2165
02:05:22,760 --> 02:05:24,840
...want to live on
the farmhouse hereafter.

2166
02:05:37,040 --> 02:05:38,240
C'mon,...

2167
02:05:39,280 --> 02:05:40,480
...end it now.

2168
02:05:41,800 --> 02:05:43,040
It's late.

2169
02:05:45,520 --> 02:05:46,800
Let's go.

2170
02:06:04,560 --> 02:06:06,160
You've been with me for years...

2171
02:06:07,240 --> 02:06:09,000
...yet you're scared of bullet sounds!

2172
02:06:13,680 --> 02:06:15,560
We were friends for 40 years.

2173
02:06:16,280 --> 02:06:17,720
I'd warned him,...

2174
02:06:18,200 --> 02:06:19,840
...don't go to the farm house.

2175
02:06:20,920 --> 02:06:22,320
He didn't pay heed.

2176
02:06:42,640 --> 02:06:43,720
Congratulations.

2177
02:06:44,760 --> 02:06:46,120
Only one Thakur remains now.

2178
02:06:48,440 --> 02:06:49,600
I stand before you.

2179
02:06:51,680 --> 02:06:53,480
You won't get a better chance.

2180
02:06:54,600 --> 02:06:55,840
Kill me right now.

2181
02:06:58,600 --> 02:06:59,960
Or tomorrow onwards...

2182
02:07:01,120 --> 02:07:02,680
...Ishan will have no mother.

2183
02:07:19,040 --> 02:07:20,800
- Good morning, Bhau.
- Morning.

2184
02:07:21,640 --> 02:07:23,320
Devi, Chheda.

2185
02:07:28,880 --> 02:07:30,800
- Chheda.
- Devi.

2186
02:07:32,720 --> 02:07:34,040
Tell me.

2187
02:07:34,640 --> 02:07:36,720
Devi, I'm really sorry.

2188
02:07:37,640 --> 02:07:40,360
I regret what happened with Dada.

2189
02:07:41,360 --> 02:07:43,640
- Nobody can alter fate.
- Right.

2190
02:07:44,720 --> 02:07:46,040
Anyway,...

2191
02:07:46,200 --> 02:07:47,880
...speak to me frankly.

2192
02:07:48,480 --> 02:07:50,800
Well, the bookies...

2193
02:07:50,960 --> 02:07:53,400
...and gamblers wanted
a raise in their share...

2194
02:07:53,480 --> 02:07:55,120
They were given 25%

2195
02:07:55,320 --> 02:07:58,200
Well, the risk has also increased, Devi.

2196
02:07:58,960 --> 02:08:01,200
Besides the police take a higher share.

2197
02:08:01,280 --> 02:08:02,600
How much?

2198
02:08:04,120 --> 02:08:05,480
50%

2199
02:08:06,480 --> 02:08:07,640
Chheda,...

2200
02:08:08,640 --> 02:08:11,160
...you dared to come here and say this...

2201
02:08:11,240 --> 02:08:14,080
...because you think after
dad and Ramdas' death,...

2202
02:08:14,560 --> 02:08:16,120
...Thakur family has weakened.

2203
02:08:16,600 --> 02:08:19,400
Devi, you're mistaken.

2204
02:08:21,560 --> 02:08:22,640
Okay.

2205
02:08:23,400 --> 02:08:24,760
You shall get what you're...

2206
02:08:25,360 --> 02:08:26,520
...fated to get.

2207
02:08:27,520 --> 02:08:28,520
All the best.

2208
02:08:29,280 --> 02:08:30,880
Okay, I'll leave now.

2209
02:08:38,160 --> 02:08:39,560
Devi,...

2210
02:08:40,080 --> 02:08:41,280
Yes, Anna?

2211
02:08:41,440 --> 02:08:43,240
Ronnie wants to meet you.

2212
02:08:45,920 --> 02:08:47,960
- Ronnie?
- Rana had called.

2213
02:08:48,560 --> 02:08:49,840
Everyone wants to meet.

2214
02:08:52,600 --> 02:08:54,720
- Rana called?
- Not here.

2215
02:08:55,320 --> 02:08:56,520
At my residence.

2216
02:09:00,440 --> 02:09:01,560
This morning.

2217
02:09:02,040 --> 02:09:03,360
Tell him we won't meet.

2218
02:09:03,920 --> 02:09:04,920
No,...

2219
02:09:05,120 --> 02:09:06,240
...we will meet.

2220
02:09:08,280 --> 02:09:09,600
The ritual is day after.

2221
02:09:09,680 --> 02:09:10,800
We'll meet that night.

2222
02:09:13,360 --> 02:09:14,400
Okay.

2223
02:09:16,960 --> 02:09:18,240
No, Ronnie.

2224
02:09:19,160 --> 02:09:21,560
We can't kill Devi at that meeting.

2225
02:09:23,480 --> 02:09:25,280
Tandel, Yusuf and other gang members...

2226
02:09:25,920 --> 02:09:27,280
...won't agree to it.

2227
02:09:28,200 --> 02:09:29,760
Besides Devi is no fool...

2228
02:09:31,160 --> 02:09:33,200
...to be ignorant of our intent.

2229
02:09:34,760 --> 02:09:36,040
Then how do we kill him?

2230
02:09:37,400 --> 02:09:38,760
At the meeting,...

2231
02:09:38,840 --> 02:09:40,800
...I'll come with Devi in his car.

2232
02:09:41,680 --> 02:09:43,280
A bomb will be fit in that car.

2233
02:09:44,600 --> 02:09:46,560
When Devi leaves after the meeting,...

2234
02:09:47,200 --> 02:09:48,440
...there will be a blast.

2235
02:09:49,600 --> 02:09:50,840
Who will plant the bomb?

2236
02:09:51,880 --> 02:09:53,240
Who is it?

2237
02:09:56,040 --> 02:09:56,920
Anna!

2238
02:10:07,240 --> 02:10:09,000
Devi, Rana's here.

2239
02:10:12,960 --> 02:10:15,160
Hello, please sit.

2240
02:10:15,880 --> 02:10:18,960
Take water in your right hand...

2241
02:10:25,200 --> 02:10:26,680
Hello, uncle Rana.

2242
02:10:40,520 --> 02:10:41,560
Cheers!

2243
02:10:42,200 --> 02:10:43,480
We'll get 60% commission.

2244
02:10:43,560 --> 02:10:45,000
But Devi said 50.

2245
02:10:45,080 --> 02:10:46,880
Rana will be our boss from tomorrow...

2246
02:10:47,560 --> 02:10:49,280
...because Devi will be killed tonight.

2247
02:10:49,760 --> 02:10:51,640
End of all things.

2248
02:10:52,960 --> 02:10:54,080
Devi!

2249
02:11:01,640 --> 02:11:03,760
Everyone leave!

2250
02:11:04,280 --> 02:11:05,680
Move!

2251
02:11:05,760 --> 02:11:07,960
Don't you understand?
Get lost.

2252
02:11:25,680 --> 02:11:27,400
The root cause is...

2253
02:11:27,840 --> 02:11:29,800
...that dog Rana who tempted us.

2254
02:11:30,280 --> 02:11:32,000
We were happy with 25%

2255
02:11:32,080 --> 02:11:33,760
- Ask them... 25...
- Yes.

2256
02:11:35,360 --> 02:11:37,200
I gave you my word.

2257
02:11:37,960 --> 02:11:40,440
You shall get what you're fated to get.

2258
02:11:40,880 --> 02:11:41,880
Yes.

2259
02:11:42,440 --> 02:11:44,560
You ruined a good enough business.

2260
02:11:44,960 --> 02:11:46,240
No...

2261
02:11:53,600 --> 02:11:55,960
We're okay with 20

2262
02:11:56,360 --> 02:11:57,720
Yes.

2263
02:12:00,160 --> 02:12:01,400
Enjoy.

2264
02:12:02,240 --> 02:12:03,760
Why should we give 20 also, Potya?

2265
02:12:15,560 --> 02:12:17,080
Bhau, Potya isn't around?

2266
02:12:17,960 --> 02:12:19,240
Devi gave him a new bike.

2267
02:12:19,800 --> 02:12:21,160
He has gone for a test drive.

2268
02:12:24,720 --> 02:12:26,000
- Hey.
- Yes.

2269
02:12:42,440 --> 02:12:43,840
Welcome.

2270
02:12:51,120 --> 02:12:52,320
Move.

2271
02:13:01,600 --> 02:13:03,320
I'm not Chheda, Devidas.

2272
02:13:04,440 --> 02:13:06,760
- I was waiting for you.
- Shoot.

2273
02:13:07,920 --> 02:13:09,840
I won't give you an easy death.

2274
02:13:19,200 --> 02:13:20,800
You got a chance...

2275
02:13:22,720 --> 02:13:24,160
...but you lost it.

2276
02:14:41,640 --> 02:14:44,360
Ronnie, I'd told you...

2277
02:14:44,920 --> 02:14:46,560
...you lost the chance.

2278
02:14:59,240 --> 02:15:01,000
Bhau, the ritual is taking too long.

2279
02:15:01,880 --> 02:15:02,920
No idea.

2280
02:15:03,480 --> 02:15:05,400
Perhaps the priest was paid more.

2281
02:15:07,360 --> 02:15:08,480
I'll leave.

2282
02:15:08,560 --> 02:15:10,200
I've to arrange for
the meeting in the evening.

2283
02:15:10,920 --> 02:15:13,080
Tell Devi I'll fetch him in the evening.

2284
02:15:13,880 --> 02:15:15,000
Tell him yourself.

2285
02:15:16,440 --> 02:15:17,760
Not there.

2286
02:15:18,440 --> 02:15:19,600
There.

2287
02:15:42,120 --> 02:15:44,360
Devi, you left the ritual...

2288
02:15:45,440 --> 02:15:48,720
Uncle Rana, I never liked prayers.

2289
02:15:49,440 --> 02:15:51,600
So, I thought I'd finish some urgent work.

2290
02:15:52,800 --> 02:15:53,800
Also,...

2291
02:15:53,960 --> 02:15:55,680
...I'll wait for you in the evening.

2292
02:15:55,960 --> 02:15:56,880
Oh yes.

2293
02:16:08,360 --> 02:16:12,200
Anna, Ronnie won't trouble you hereafter.

2294
02:16:13,440 --> 02:16:14,920
Devi, I did all this...

2295
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:16,640
- ...to end the dispute.
- There's no time, Anna.

2296
02:16:17,480 --> 02:16:18,680
Come.

2297
02:16:28,920 --> 02:16:30,120
- Uncle Rana?
- Inside.

2298
02:16:34,960 --> 02:16:36,000
Uncle Rana.

2299
02:16:36,800 --> 02:16:37,960
What just happened?

2300
02:16:38,440 --> 02:16:39,840
What just happened, uncle...

2301
02:16:40,560 --> 02:16:41,560
Idiot!

2302
02:16:42,280 --> 02:16:43,160
Didn't you know...

2303
02:16:43,800 --> 02:16:45,000
...Devi wasn't present?

2304
02:16:45,240 --> 02:16:46,880
- Uncle Rana...
- What were you doing there?

2305
02:16:46,960 --> 02:16:48,880
Uncle, Devi didn't let anyone know.

2306
02:16:57,880 --> 02:16:59,720
What do we do now?

2307
02:17:03,080 --> 02:17:04,160
Call Pari.

2308
02:17:10,320 --> 02:17:11,720
- Pari?
- Yes?

2309
02:17:12,440 --> 02:17:13,440
What's wrong?

2310
02:17:15,640 --> 02:17:16,840
Devi has called home.

2311
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:19,000
Right now.

2312
02:17:22,320 --> 02:17:23,360
Meet him.

2313
02:17:23,760 --> 02:17:25,480
- I don't want to meet him.
- Why?

2314
02:17:26,960 --> 02:17:28,000
Bobby,...

2315
02:17:30,240 --> 02:17:31,920
...love just doesn't ebb.

2316
02:17:34,120 --> 02:17:35,240
Go.

2317
02:17:56,040 --> 02:17:57,920
I love you, mummy.
Bye.

2318
02:17:58,320 --> 02:17:59,560
Uncle, you?

2319
02:17:59,720 --> 02:18:00,920
Pari just left.

2320
02:18:01,160 --> 02:18:02,600
- I know.
- Hello, grandpa.

2321
02:18:02,880 --> 02:18:03,880
You...

2322
02:18:04,560 --> 02:18:06,040
I'm here to get this offspring of Thakur.

2323
02:18:06,120 --> 02:18:07,960
What are you saying?
He's my son.

2324
02:18:08,120 --> 02:18:09,800
I won't let you take him.

2325
02:18:09,880 --> 02:18:11,800
- You're gay!
- Don't involve him your fight.

2326
02:18:12,040 --> 02:18:13,080
Uncle!

2327
02:18:13,280 --> 02:18:15,720
- Uncle, I won't let you take him.
- Ishan!

2328
02:18:16,400 --> 02:18:17,440
Ishan!

2329
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:21,280
Ishan!

2330
02:18:21,720 --> 02:18:22,760
Ishan...

2331
02:18:56,120 --> 02:18:57,520
Mom!

2332
02:19:00,840 --> 02:19:02,000
Pari!

2333
02:19:04,800 --> 02:19:06,240
What brings you here?

2334
02:19:06,880 --> 02:19:08,000
Devi called me.

2335
02:19:08,080 --> 02:19:09,080
Devi called you?

2336
02:19:10,760 --> 02:19:12,480
But he's not home.

2337
02:19:13,480 --> 02:19:15,480
He left for ash immersion ritual.

2338
02:19:16,240 --> 02:19:18,880
No, Ranjit called me
and said Devi sent for me.

2339
02:19:19,320 --> 02:19:20,520
Me?

2340
02:19:21,920 --> 02:19:23,000
I didn't call.

2341
02:19:42,800 --> 02:19:43,840
Bobby!

2342
02:19:47,080 --> 02:19:47,960
Ishan!

2343
02:19:48,040 --> 02:19:49,200
Took him away.

2344
02:19:53,920 --> 02:19:56,240
Devidas Thakur!

2345
02:19:56,440 --> 02:19:58,080
- Your father's name.
- Kalidas...

2346
02:19:58,280 --> 02:19:59,440
...Bhanudas Thakur.

2347
02:19:59,520 --> 02:20:01,120
The name of the deceased.

2348
02:20:01,280 --> 02:20:04,280
Ramdas Kalidas Thakur, my elder brother.

2349
02:20:09,040 --> 02:20:10,920
- All are here?
- Yes.

2350
02:20:11,680 --> 02:20:13,480
I found each and every one of them.

2351
02:20:28,720 --> 02:20:30,080
No...

2352
02:21:47,800 --> 02:21:48,680
Pari!

2353
02:21:50,720 --> 02:21:52,720
- Where's Ishan?
- We don't have him.

2354
02:21:53,360 --> 02:21:54,640
No!

2355
02:21:55,200 --> 02:21:57,200
Where is Ishan?

2356
02:21:59,240 --> 02:22:00,760
Robert, no!

2357
02:22:01,520 --> 02:22:02,720
No!

2358
02:22:03,080 --> 02:22:04,360
Leave him, Robert.

2359
02:22:04,440 --> 02:22:05,720
No...

2360
02:22:05,800 --> 02:22:07,760
Robert, leave him.

2361
02:22:14,600 --> 02:22:17,640
Robert, he could've
told me where Ishan is.

2362
02:22:18,640 --> 02:22:19,800
I know.

2363
02:23:56,280 --> 02:23:57,520
How are you, Bhau?

2364
02:24:05,560 --> 02:24:06,560
Come.

2365
02:24:06,800 --> 02:24:07,680
Come.

2366
02:25:06,480 --> 02:25:07,800
Rascal!

2367
02:25:27,080 --> 02:25:29,520
Bhau, time to leave.

2368
02:25:29,880 --> 02:25:31,000
No.

2369
02:25:31,560 --> 02:25:33,200
This dog will tell us where Ishan is.

2370
02:25:33,280 --> 02:25:34,280
He can't.

2371
02:25:35,200 --> 02:25:36,280
I'll tell you.

2372
02:25:36,640 --> 02:25:37,760
Meaning?

2373
02:25:51,840 --> 02:25:53,080
Poor guy died for nothing!

2374
02:25:54,680 --> 02:25:55,800
You see, Pari,...

2375
02:25:56,760 --> 02:25:58,640
...many years ago you swore to...

2376
02:25:59,680 --> 02:26:01,480
...finish the Thakur family.

2377
02:26:01,800 --> 02:26:03,640
- Rana!
- I'm talking!

2378
02:26:05,320 --> 02:26:06,680
Many years before that,...

2379
02:26:07,440 --> 02:26:08,680
...I took the same oath.

2380
02:26:12,600 --> 02:26:13,960
But I didn't know...

2381
02:26:14,760 --> 02:26:16,680
...one more Thakur would be born.

2382
02:26:19,800 --> 02:26:20,920
Leave him.

2383
02:26:24,480 --> 02:26:26,400
- Ishan!
- Mummy!

2384
02:26:27,600 --> 02:26:28,880
Mummy!

2385
02:28:01,400 --> 02:28:02,920
Devi!

2386
02:28:06,760 --> 02:28:08,120
Devi!

2387
02:28:47,800 --> 02:28:49,280
Devi!

2388
02:28:50,520 --> 02:28:51,720
Devi!

2389
02:28:52,800 --> 02:28:54,000
Devi!

2390
02:28:54,080 --> 02:28:55,280
Devi!

2391
02:28:55,360 --> 02:28:57,000
Devi, get up.

2392
02:28:57,920 --> 02:28:59,840
Devi, get up!

2393
02:29:02,840 --> 02:29:04,160
Get up.

2394
02:29:05,480 --> 02:29:06,880
Scornful eyes...

2395
02:29:07,760 --> 02:29:09,200
...smiling lips...

2396
02:29:09,280 --> 02:29:11,360
...love isn't meant for the living.

2397
02:29:11,920 --> 02:29:13,160
It's proven today.

2398
02:29:16,200 --> 02:29:19,200
Forgive me, Devi, please!

2399
02:29:19,360 --> 02:29:21,240
Your oath was fulfilled.

2400
02:29:21,320 --> 02:29:24,320
Devi, I won't let anything happen to you.

2401
02:29:24,920 --> 02:29:26,840
I won't let anything happen to you.

2402
02:29:27,040 --> 02:29:28,800
Mummy, who's he?

2403
02:29:30,520 --> 02:29:31,760
He's your father.

2404
02:29:37,160 --> 02:29:38,440
Devi!

2405
02:29:38,560 --> 02:29:39,920
Devi!

2406
02:29:42,880 --> 02:29:44,440
Devi!

2407
02:30:19,160 --> 02:30:20,600
I don't agree with your decision, dad.

2408
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:23,600
Neither Rana nor D'costa are alive.

2409
02:30:24,960 --> 02:30:26,440
The power is in our hands, dad.

2410
02:30:27,280 --> 02:30:28,880
What will we do with
so much power, Ranjit?

2411
02:30:29,520 --> 02:30:31,640
Despite all the power I yielded,...

2412
02:30:32,160 --> 02:30:34,080
...could I stop you from
killing Anwar and Ramdas?

2413
02:30:34,320 --> 02:30:35,800
- What are you saying?
- I know everything.

2414
02:30:35,880 --> 02:30:37,120
- Dad...
- I know everything.

2415
02:30:40,920 --> 02:30:43,240
There were 8 people including Rana...

2416
02:30:43,680 --> 02:30:45,120
...when you killed my son.

2417
02:30:47,560 --> 02:30:48,720
I killed them all.

2418
02:30:52,160 --> 02:30:54,440
You cut my son's left leg first, right?

2419
02:30:55,520 --> 02:30:57,040
Dad...

2420
02:30:57,280 --> 02:30:58,280
Then left hand.

2421
02:31:01,560 --> 02:31:02,680
I had gone mad, dad!

2422
02:31:03,400 --> 02:31:04,400
I went mad.

2423
02:31:06,600 --> 02:31:08,120
Wonder what got into me!

2424
02:31:09,640 --> 02:31:10,800
I was angry...

2425
02:31:14,760 --> 02:31:17,960
Nobody can kill a Thakur and remain alive.

2426
02:31:19,520 --> 02:31:20,760
You witch!
