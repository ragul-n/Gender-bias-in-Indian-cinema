1
00:03:00,994 --> 00:03:04,987
Don't move! You are under arrest!

2
00:03:35,028 --> 00:03:36,893
I don't why Maya is not
answering the phone!

3
00:03:36,997 --> 00:03:38,624
Must be parking her car!

4
00:03:38,732 --> 00:03:40,427
Or maybe she is stuck
in traffic.

5
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,990
But she should at least
answer her phone!

6
00:03:42,102 --> 00:03:43,160
Maybe it's on silent mode.

7
00:03:43,937 --> 00:03:45,962
It's been an hour.
She has still not arrived.

8
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,637
I don't know what it is.

9
00:03:48,742 --> 00:03:51,040
I think her watch has stopped.

10
00:03:51,111 --> 00:03:52,442
Or maybe she told
you in your dream...

11
00:03:52,512 --> 00:03:54,980
...that she is coming to receive
you at the airport.

12
00:03:56,016 --> 00:03:58,109
You are joking!?
- Oh!

13
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,453
Feels good.

14
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:05,184
Feels good.

15
00:04:10,063 --> 00:04:11,758
Vavoom.

16
00:04:24,878 --> 00:04:26,209
I feels good.

17
00:04:26,546 --> 00:04:29,845
You take a cab and leave.
I will wait here.

18
00:04:30,517 --> 00:04:31,575
Okay!

19
00:04:34,854 --> 00:04:35,980
Cab!

20
00:04:41,161 --> 00:04:42,219
Feels good.

21
00:04:42,996 --> 00:04:44,122
42nd Street!

22
00:04:44,197 --> 00:04:47,064
Excuse me! Can I share the cab with you?
- Sure!

23
00:04:47,133 --> 00:04:48,532
Thank you! Thank you!

24
00:04:49,803 --> 00:04:52,863
Maya! Maya!

25
00:04:54,574 --> 00:04:55,632
You are here!

26
00:04:55,709 --> 00:04:57,506
I was waiting for you at the
airport for the past 2 hours!

27
00:04:57,577 --> 00:04:59,067
You were going to
come to receive me!

28
00:04:59,179 --> 00:05:00,510
I should have come to
receive whom, Neel?

29
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:03,140
A thief!
A fraud or a womaniser!

30
00:05:03,216 --> 00:05:07,516
What has happened to you?
Are you okay?

31
00:05:07,587 --> 00:05:09,714
I will tell you if I
am okay or not! Okay!

32
00:05:12,525 --> 00:05:16,154
What is this? What is this?
What is this?

33
00:05:17,797 --> 00:05:19,264
Just see it for yourself, Neel!

34
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:27,071
Will you still say you
didn't do anything?

35
00:05:27,173 --> 00:05:30,267
Maya, all this... this...

36
00:05:32,545 --> 00:05:36,538
This is not what you think it is!
Trust me on that!

37
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:38,982
Till date, I have being
trusting you, Neel!

38
00:05:40,186 --> 00:05:42,552
Had I known before that you
don't deserve my trust...

39
00:05:42,622 --> 00:05:46,183
...then it wouldn't have
hurt me so much today!

40
00:05:46,559 --> 00:05:48,550
But I have told you everything!

41
00:05:48,628 --> 00:05:52,086
You have hurt me, Neel!
You have really hurt me!

42
00:05:52,632 --> 00:05:54,862
Now how do I explain to you that...

43
00:05:54,968 --> 00:05:56,196
I had explained to you, Neel!

44
00:05:56,636 --> 00:05:59,867
That leaving a job of 2 lakhs
dollars you are going to India.

45
00:06:00,106 --> 00:06:02,973
But you didn't understand.
- Maya.

46
00:06:03,076 --> 00:06:04,941
But today I have understood!

47
00:06:05,145 --> 00:06:07,943
You wanted to earn
crores using fraud!

48
00:06:08,014 --> 00:06:09,948
Oh shut up, Maya!
- What do you mean shut up?

49
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:12,017
Tanvi has done all this!

50
00:06:12,185 --> 00:06:14,050
So that Jordan loses respect for me.

51
00:06:14,154 --> 00:06:15,587
You have lost that respect.

52
00:06:15,722 --> 00:06:17,883
And along with yourself you
have disgraced me too!

53
00:06:17,991 --> 00:06:20,118
Do you know because of you
I can't venture out of the house!

54
00:06:20,193 --> 00:06:21,683
I can't go to college!

55
00:06:21,961 --> 00:06:25,021
People ask me, why did
you love such a man?

56
00:06:25,899 --> 00:06:30,233
Look into my eyes!
Do you think I am a fraud?

57
00:06:35,341 --> 00:06:38,333
I don't regret what people
think about me!

58
00:06:40,146 --> 00:06:43,343
I regret that you have
misunderstood me.

59
00:06:43,817 --> 00:06:47,150
Yes. Because truth is
in front of my eyes.

60
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:54,055
Try and believe me.
- Shut up, Neel!

61
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:57,855
Just... now I don't want to
hear any justification!

62
00:06:57,997 --> 00:07:00,363
Just go away!
Just get out of here!

63
00:07:11,644 --> 00:07:12,702
Maya!

64
00:07:56,222 --> 00:07:59,749
Sir! We are ready to close!
- Yes!

65
00:08:26,252 --> 00:08:27,446
Arrest him!

66
00:08:35,895 --> 00:08:38,022
It's all a pack of lies, officer!

67
00:08:38,097 --> 00:08:40,258
I have not done anything wrong!
Please believe me!

68
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:41,391
I am innocent!

69
00:08:41,467 --> 00:08:44,459
I have heard that lie
a thousand times!

70
00:08:45,004 --> 00:08:46,995
Every criminal says that!

71
00:08:47,106 --> 00:08:48,266
But I am not a criminal, officer!

72
00:08:48,341 --> 00:08:50,275
I am telling the truth! Please
try and believe me!

73
00:08:50,343 --> 00:08:52,743
Believe me, officer!
Neel is innocent!

74
00:08:52,812 --> 00:08:55,906
If you don't believe me,
you can ask anybody!

75
00:08:56,015 --> 00:08:57,744
What is your relationship with Neel?

76
00:08:58,117 --> 00:09:00,779
I am his friend, his brother,
his everything!

77
00:09:01,054 --> 00:09:03,284
Since childhood we
have never parted!

78
00:09:03,356 --> 00:09:04,414
This is the first time
that we have parted!

79
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:06,048
He is in prison and I am outside!

80
00:09:06,259 --> 00:09:10,355
I beg you, officer! Release him!
Neel is not a fraud!

81
00:09:10,463 --> 00:09:13,193
Attorney, tell him!
I want to meet him now!

82
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:16,027
Sorry. Investigation is on.
You can't meet him.

83
00:09:16,135 --> 00:09:19,036
Officer, along with Neel
investigate me too!

84
00:09:19,138 --> 00:09:21,231
Are you kidding?
Are you joking?

85
00:09:21,341 --> 00:09:23,138
I am not kidding!
I am serious, sir!

86
00:09:23,243 --> 00:09:26,076
What law is this!
Somebody filed a report against Neel!

87
00:09:26,179 --> 00:09:27,237
And you arrested him!

88
00:09:27,313 --> 00:09:28,780
And when I want to file
a report against myself...

89
00:09:28,848 --> 00:09:30,406
...then why don't you arrest me?

90
00:09:30,516 --> 00:09:31,778
Mr. Sunny, what are you doing?

91
00:09:31,851 --> 00:09:34,251
What can I do, sir?
My friend is being framed!

92
00:09:34,354 --> 00:09:36,219
And you want me to sit quietly!

93
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:38,186
Mr. Sunny, don't waste time!

94
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:39,781
Now shall we go and find the man...

95
00:09:39,859 --> 00:09:41,417
...because of whom Neel is framed.

96
00:09:42,528 --> 00:09:44,996
Yes. I am fed up with this boy!

97
00:09:45,798 --> 00:09:46,856
Rajesh!

98
00:09:50,169 --> 00:09:53,969
Tanvi! Attorney, Tanvi!
It's Tanvi!

99
00:09:54,073 --> 00:09:56,268
Tanvi?
Who is she?

100
00:09:56,376 --> 00:09:58,901
She is the woman who has done
all this and framed me!

101
00:09:59,012 --> 00:10:02,175
She has destroyed me, my
love life, my career!

102
00:10:02,282 --> 00:10:05,012
Everything!
She has ruined me, officer!

103
00:10:06,486 --> 00:10:09,819
Mr. Neel, if you are innocent,
I promise you...

104
00:10:09,889 --> 00:10:11,914
...you will come to no harm.

105
00:10:12,992 --> 00:10:16,450
So tell us. What happened?
The whole truth.

106
00:10:16,562 --> 00:10:21,465
And nothing but the truth
from the beginning.

107
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:23,228
It all started with Kumar.

108
00:10:25,038 --> 00:10:26,903
My mentor and my guide!

109
00:10:31,978 --> 00:10:34,037
Thank you!
Thank you very much!

110
00:10:35,214 --> 00:10:36,841
My book is about a thought of mine...

111
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:38,474
...that has consumed me for years.

112
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,919
You see, there are three kinds
of people in this world.

113
00:10:42,221 --> 00:10:43,586
People who make things happen.

114
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:45,953
People who watch things happen.

115
00:10:46,225 --> 00:10:48,591
And people who just
wonder what happened.

116
00:10:50,163 --> 00:10:51,858
People who make things happen...

117
00:10:51,931 --> 00:10:54,593
...are the ones who are
called dreamers.

118
00:10:56,369 --> 00:10:58,303
Dreamers make the world go around.

119
00:10:58,538 --> 00:11:01,166
It's our God given
responsibility to dream.

120
00:11:01,274 --> 00:11:02,969
It's your responsibility to dream!

121
00:11:04,077 --> 00:11:05,977
It's your responsibility to dream!

122
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:09,177
And it's your responsibility
to dream!

123
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:12,281
Don't you dream?
- Yes!

124
00:11:12,518 --> 00:11:15,919
Well, this book has been a dream
of mine for many years!

125
00:11:16,089 --> 00:11:19,183
And now it's a reality.
It's come true.

126
00:11:19,292 --> 00:11:20,987
And your dream will come true too.

127
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,321
Thank you! Thank you very much!

128
00:11:26,566 --> 00:11:29,899
Mr. Kumar, will your dream come
true through this book?

129
00:11:30,103 --> 00:11:31,434
Well, it's a great start.

130
00:11:31,571 --> 00:11:32,902
But my dream will come true when...

131
00:11:32,972 --> 00:11:36,066
...through my book, people's
dreams will come true.

132
00:11:36,142 --> 00:11:37,973
What happened?
- Quickly!

133
00:11:38,177 --> 00:11:39,269
Commotion in New York!

134
00:11:39,345 --> 00:11:40,642
Guys, its Mr. Kumar!
- Kumar sir! Kumar sir!

135
00:11:41,581 --> 00:11:43,071
Mr. Kumar!
- Kumar sir! Kumar sir!

136
00:11:43,149 --> 00:11:44,275
Kumar!

137
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:45,908
Nice meeting you, sir!
- Sir! Sir!

138
00:11:45,985 --> 00:11:47,976
Autograph please!
- Pen! Pen! Quickly!

139
00:11:48,054 --> 00:11:49,521
Autograph! Quickly!
- Sir, he is a very big fan of yours.

140
00:11:50,123 --> 00:11:50,322
Sir!

141
00:11:50,323 --> 00:11:53,354
If there is a problem at 3 in
the night, he needs Mr. Kumar!

142
00:11:53,426 --> 00:11:54,552
Thank you, sir!
- He needs Mr. Kumar!

143
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,924
Thank you!
- Today we are meeting you personally!

144
00:11:56,996 --> 00:11:58,054
Mr. Kumar!

145
00:11:58,197 --> 00:11:59,994
Any message for us, sir?

146
00:12:00,099 --> 00:12:02,567
You are young and smart!
You must dream big!

147
00:12:02,668 --> 00:12:06,195
And let those dreams move from
your head to your heart!

148
00:12:06,572 --> 00:12:08,563
And then just follow your heart!
- Okay!

149
00:12:08,641 --> 00:12:10,575
Thank you, sir! We always
follow our hearts!

150
00:12:10,943 --> 00:12:15,039
Always smile and follow your heart!

151
00:12:42,008 --> 00:12:43,976
Follow your heart!
Follow your heart!

152
00:12:44,043 --> 00:12:47,069
Follow your heart!
Follow your heart!

153
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:49,614
Follow your heart!
Follow your heart!

154
00:12:49,715 --> 00:12:52,081
Follow your heart!
Follow your heart!

155
00:12:52,185 --> 00:12:54,415
Whether you receive joy
or sorrow in love.

156
00:12:54,487 --> 00:12:57,354
Keep walking on this path.

157
00:12:57,457 --> 00:12:59,618
Whether you receive joy
or sorrow in love.

158
00:12:59,725 --> 00:13:02,626
Keep walking on this path.

159
00:13:02,995 --> 00:13:05,395
Smilingly. Smilingly.

160
00:13:05,498 --> 00:13:07,989
Smilingly. Smilingly.

161
00:13:08,201 --> 00:13:10,635
Smilingly. Smilingly.

162
00:13:10,736 --> 00:13:13,227
Smilingly. Smilingly.

163
00:13:13,372 --> 00:13:15,567
Follow your heart!
Follow your heart!

164
00:13:15,675 --> 00:13:17,609
Follow your heart!
Follow your heart!

165
00:13:17,743 --> 00:13:20,678
Whether you receive joy
or sorrow in love.

166
00:13:20,746 --> 00:13:23,510
Keep walking on this path.

167
00:13:23,749 --> 00:13:25,580
Whether you receive joy
or sorrow in love.

168
00:13:25,685 --> 00:13:28,677
Keep walking on this path.

169
00:13:29,021 --> 00:13:31,421
Smilingly. Smilingly.

170
00:13:31,691 --> 00:13:33,750
Smilingly. Smilingly.

Smilingly. Smilingly.

172
00:13:36,762 --> 00:13:39,560
Smilingly. Smilingly.

173
00:14:04,524 --> 00:14:06,788
In the testimony of eyes.

174
00:14:07,226 --> 00:14:09,490
In the world of thoughts.

175
00:14:09,662 --> 00:14:14,793
There should be love.

176
00:14:15,067 --> 00:14:17,058
No matter what your
destination is.

177
00:14:17,436 --> 00:14:20,064
No matter which jamboree it is.

178
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:25,140
We should be together
day and night.

179
00:14:25,278 --> 00:14:30,375
We should love each other.

180
00:14:30,616 --> 00:14:37,078
We should always love.

181
00:14:37,156 --> 00:14:39,181
Smilingly. Smilingly.

182
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:42,086
Smilingly. Smilingly.

183
00:14:42,228 --> 00:14:44,628
Smilingly. Smilingly.

184
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:47,460
Smilingly. Smilingly.

185
00:15:12,491 --> 00:15:14,550
You are being discussed.

186
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:17,322
You are being talked about.

187
00:15:17,496 --> 00:15:22,661
Now I am not aware
of day and night.

188
00:15:22,802 --> 00:15:25,566
I am in your arms.

189
00:15:25,805 --> 00:15:27,864
You are on my paths.

190
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:33,168
Now why to worry?

191
00:15:33,312 --> 00:15:38,306
We are not afraid of the world.

192
00:15:38,417 --> 00:15:44,754
We will cover the journey.

193
00:15:44,824 --> 00:15:47,156
Smilingly. Smilingly.

194
00:15:47,326 --> 00:15:49,886
Smilingly. Smilingly.

195
00:15:50,162 --> 00:15:52,460
Smilingly. Smilingly.

196
00:15:52,565 --> 00:15:55,159
Smilingly. Smilingly.

197
00:15:55,268 --> 00:15:57,463
Follow your heart!
Follow your heart!

198
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:00,164
Follow your heart!
Follow your heart!

199
00:16:23,596 --> 00:16:25,496
Thank God you told me about it!

200
00:16:26,532 --> 00:16:27,658
Who told you to have sweets?

201
00:16:27,733 --> 00:16:28,791
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!

202
00:16:28,868 --> 00:16:30,199
O God! I am so sorry!
- No, no, no!

203
00:16:30,269 --> 00:16:31,327
...I am so sorry!
- No, no, no!

204
00:16:31,404 --> 00:16:32,598
...It's my fault!
- It's my fault!

205
00:16:32,705 --> 00:16:33,729
...It's my fault!
- It's my fault!

206
00:16:33,806 --> 00:16:34,345
I am sorry!

207
00:16:34,346 --> 00:16:35,865
- It's my fault! Sorry!
- Sorry!

208
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:42,773
Remembered something?
- Everything!

209
00:16:43,215 --> 00:16:45,206
Yes! But get those documents!

210
00:16:45,351 --> 00:16:46,716
Yes! Oops!

211
00:16:46,786 --> 00:16:48,686
O God!
- I am really sorry! I am...

212
00:16:48,788 --> 00:16:49,846
I will call you back!
I will call you back!

213
00:16:49,922 --> 00:16:51,253
It's okay! It's okay! It's my fault!

214
00:16:51,357 --> 00:16:52,847
Look... I am... I am...

215
00:16:52,925 --> 00:16:54,722
I will get your meal!
- No! It's fine! It's my fault!

216
00:16:54,794 --> 00:16:56,227
It's my fault! I am going
to get you the meal!

217
00:16:56,295 --> 00:16:57,353
It's okay! Never mind!

218
00:16:57,463 --> 00:16:59,226
Please believe me! It's
happened because of me!

219
00:16:59,332 --> 00:17:00,526
It's okay!
- You don't worry!

220
00:17:00,633 --> 00:17:01,861
You sit over here. I am
going to get your meal!

221
00:17:01,934 --> 00:17:03,799
It's okay! Never mind!
- Please! Please!

222
00:17:12,411 --> 00:17:13,469
Have a nice day!

223
00:17:16,615 --> 00:17:18,242
Here is your happy meal.

224
00:17:20,419 --> 00:17:21,477
Two colas?

225
00:17:21,687 --> 00:17:25,487
That's for me! I just thought...

226
00:17:25,591 --> 00:17:27,889
If you don't like it,
I will go somewhere else.

227
00:17:28,627 --> 00:17:29,821
I will, I will go!

228
00:17:29,929 --> 00:17:31,362
Sorry about that!

229
00:17:46,746 --> 00:17:47,804
Hi!

230
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,280
Actually I was thinking since
we already sort of met and...

231
00:17:50,349 --> 00:17:51,475
Sure!
- And...

232
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:53,484
Go ahead!
- Thank you!

233
00:17:55,654 --> 00:17:58,020
By the way I am Neel!
- I am Maya!

234
00:17:58,357 --> 00:17:59,415
Hi, Maya!

235
00:18:03,696 --> 00:18:04,754
What's up?

236
00:18:09,568 --> 00:18:11,502
Oh no!
- What happened?

237
00:18:11,971 --> 00:18:14,303
My cell phone! I think
I have misplaced my...

238
00:18:15,474 --> 00:18:18,034
Could I use your cell for a second?
- Yes! Sure!

239
00:18:34,059 --> 00:18:35,822
Thanks! Got it!

240
00:18:40,866 --> 00:18:41,924
Got it!

241
00:18:42,034 --> 00:18:44,434
'He gave me his number
and he took my number.'

242
00:18:45,704 --> 00:18:46,762
You are too much!

243
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:47,897
...How much time has passed
since this incident?

244
00:18:48,707 --> 00:18:50,072
Maybe a year!

245
00:18:52,478 --> 00:18:55,641
Tomorrow is Valentines day.
What are you gifting me?

246
00:18:55,848 --> 00:18:58,612
What? You should gift me!

247
00:18:58,717 --> 00:19:01,083
I mean girls don't give gifts
to guys! Guys give it to girls!

248
00:19:01,387 --> 00:19:04,379
You could me the first one!
- Yes! Sure!

249
00:19:05,858 --> 00:19:06,916
Okay!

250
00:19:07,092 --> 00:19:11,392
I can tell the whole world...
I love Tina!

251
00:19:11,497 --> 00:19:13,270
You are my sweetheart!

252
00:19:13,271 --> 00:19:14,398
- Sunny!
- Hey!

253
00:19:14,467 --> 00:19:15,627
Where were you?
- Hi!

254
00:19:16,502 --> 00:19:17,560
Where is Maya?

255
00:19:17,636 --> 00:19:20,002
I haven't seen Maya. Please
don't disturb me!

256
00:19:20,105 --> 00:19:22,039
Go away!
- Okay! I will see you! Tina, see you!

257
00:19:22,107 --> 00:19:24,041
Bye!
- Tina darling, I love you!

258
00:19:27,046 --> 00:19:28,104
Hi!
- Hi, Neel!

259
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,371
Seen Maya anywhere?
- No, I haven't seen her the whole day!

260
00:19:30,483 --> 00:19:30,629
Okay!

261
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:32,383
- If you see her, tell her I said hi.
- Sure, I will do that!

262
00:19:32,451 --> 00:19:33,509
Okay! Bye!

263
00:19:37,056 --> 00:19:38,114
For you, uncle!

264
00:19:43,395 --> 00:19:45,590
Thank you!
- Thank you, uncle!

265
00:19:45,965 --> 00:19:47,023
Come on!

266
00:19:51,971 --> 00:20:00,003
Come on! Come on!

267
00:20:02,915 --> 00:20:04,780
Come on!

268
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:22,432
Come on! Come on!

269
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:32,941
Yes, Maya!
- Hi, Neel!

270
00:20:33,612 --> 00:20:35,637
What kind of surprise is this?
I am tired of running!

271
00:20:37,816 --> 00:20:38,874
Where are you?

272
00:20:38,984 --> 00:20:41,544
The binoculars in front of you!
- Binoculars!

273
00:20:41,854 --> 00:20:44,880
Yes, look in the binoculars
in front of you!

274
00:21:14,086 --> 00:21:15,144
Hi!

275
00:21:17,856 --> 00:21:21,121
Neel! I love you!

276
00:21:55,995 --> 00:21:57,053
Hi!

277
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,258
Come on!

278
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:06,128
Hey!

279
00:22:10,275 --> 00:22:11,902
Again and again you...

280
00:22:12,578 --> 00:22:14,546
Do you like to push me down!

281
00:22:14,613 --> 00:22:18,071
Yes! You look so cute when you fall!
- Yes! Sure!

282
00:22:19,118 --> 00:22:20,176
Very funny!

283
00:22:20,586 --> 00:22:22,144
Hi!
- Hi!

284
00:22:22,287 --> 00:22:23,845
How many times did you fall today?

285
00:22:23,956 --> 00:22:25,548
Too many! Too many!

286
00:22:25,691 --> 00:22:28,558
Yeah! Fine! I will see you on top!
- Okay!

287
00:22:28,894 --> 00:22:30,919
You are beautiful!
- Really!

288
00:22:32,931 --> 00:22:33,989
Can I call you tomorrow?

289
00:22:35,234 --> 00:22:36,667
Of course! Anytime!

290
00:22:37,236 --> 00:22:38,567
Darling...

291
00:22:38,637 --> 00:22:41,936
...can we go somewhere
for dinner, you know?

292
00:22:42,574 --> 00:22:44,565
You are going to take me for dinner?
- Yes! Yes!

293
00:22:44,677 --> 00:22:47,669
Where are you going to take me?
- Anyplace in Manhattan!

294
00:22:50,149 --> 00:22:53,585
Where is Neel, dude?
- Yes! I won't forget!

295
00:22:57,923 --> 00:22:59,584
Yes! I will remember!

296
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,154
Hi!
- You are a cartoon!

297
00:23:03,228 --> 00:23:05,321
Hi, dear!
- Your boyfriend is a cartoon!

298
00:23:06,765 --> 00:23:07,148
Love you!

299
00:23:07,149 --> 00:23:09,146
- I am coming! One second,
darling! One second!

300
00:23:09,147 --> 00:23:09,598
- Sure!
- Yes!

301
00:23:10,602 --> 00:23:14,800
I will tell you something and
you will go mad, Neel! I swear!

302
00:23:14,873 --> 00:23:17,137
What?
- Sit! Sit! Sit!

303
00:23:17,242 --> 00:23:18,675
Okay!

304
00:23:18,777 --> 00:23:21,769
Listen, what a girl!
What a figure!

305
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:24,676
We met and she said yes
in the first meeting!

306
00:23:25,751 --> 00:23:29,050
Is that so?
- Superb! Believe me!

307
00:23:29,154 --> 00:23:30,917
Tomorrow we are going for dinner!

308
00:23:31,256 --> 00:23:32,985
Going for dinner?
I will tell Tina!

309
00:23:33,192 --> 00:23:38,220
Hey! I am serious about Tina!
I am serious, dude!

310
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:40,195
Is that so?
- Believe me, dude!

311
00:23:40,265 --> 00:23:41,994
So go and call her.
- No.

312
00:23:42,067 --> 00:23:44,365
I am going to uncle's place
in New Jersey in the evening.

313
00:23:44,636 --> 00:23:47,002
You too come for dinner.
We will eat and talk too.

314
00:23:47,072 --> 00:23:48,130
It will be fun.

315
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,639
Message me the number. I will come.

316
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:50,834
But I don't have a cell.

317
00:23:50,943 --> 00:23:52,843
It fell in the water
and it got damaged.

318
00:23:52,978 --> 00:23:54,275
You give your number please!

319
00:23:54,379 --> 00:23:56,939
Excuse me! Pen please!
- Pen please!

320
00:24:03,989 --> 00:24:07,083
Is the food good?
- Yes, aunt.

321
00:24:07,192 --> 00:24:11,026
Dear, it feels so good. Come
here for meals everyday.

322
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:14,256
If I come everyday then
when will I study?

323
00:24:14,399 --> 00:24:16,230
You don't pass though you study.

324
00:24:16,401 --> 00:24:19,859
Uncle, this year I will pass.

325
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:28,777
Fool! Were you born reverse?

326
00:24:28,914 --> 00:24:30,779
Why are you eating from
the other hand?

327
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:33,008
Uncle!
- Yes!

328
00:24:33,085 --> 00:24:35,679
I have a special's person's
number on the other hand.

329
00:24:36,421 --> 00:24:39,879
I will finish my meals and
feed it in my cell. Okay.

330
00:24:40,025 --> 00:24:41,083
Special number?

331
00:24:41,293 --> 00:24:44,421
Yes! Very special! You
can say it's my life.

332
00:24:45,297 --> 00:24:48,824
Is it a girl's number?

333
00:24:49,268 --> 00:24:51,429
Uncle, you too!

334
00:24:53,906 --> 00:24:56,431
This guy felt shy. Tell me!

335
00:24:57,075 --> 00:25:00,067
It's not important for
the girl to be Punjabi.

336
00:25:00,145 --> 00:25:01,442
Anyone will do.

337
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,809
It will be perfectly fine.

338
00:25:03,916 --> 00:25:08,785
I will handle your father,
my brother.

339
00:25:11,089 --> 00:25:12,249
I will open the door.

340
00:25:13,926 --> 00:25:15,291
Aunt, who is it?
- Hello, aunt.

341
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,725
Greetings!
- Greetings!

342
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:21,730
Hi, Sunny!
- Neel! Uncle!

343
00:25:22,401 --> 00:25:23,459
Neel!

344
00:25:25,103 --> 00:25:29,301
Uncle! He is my special friend!
- Hello, uncle.

345
00:25:29,408 --> 00:25:33,811
You can say that Neel is my life!

346
00:25:36,481 --> 00:25:38,472
There is a separate room upstairs.
I have some work.

347
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:39,666
Shall we go?

348
00:25:39,667 --> 00:25:41,116
- Yes.
- One second.

349
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:43,745
Uncle, don't disturb us. Okay.

350
00:25:44,957 --> 00:25:46,481
Don't disturb us. Okay, aunt!

351
00:25:46,892 --> 00:25:48,951
You will go mad!

352
00:26:00,172 --> 00:26:02,868
Are you thinking what I am thinking?

353
00:26:02,975 --> 00:26:04,067
What are you thinking?

354
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:09,169
My brother sent this fool
to America trusting me.

355
00:26:09,514 --> 00:26:12,847
If this guy got slandered then
we too will be slandered.

356
00:26:12,951 --> 00:26:14,145
You are right.

357
00:26:15,187 --> 00:26:20,887
You stay here. I will go and check.
- Okay.

358
00:26:25,197 --> 00:26:26,892
Protect us.

359
00:26:27,165 --> 00:26:29,099
Dial the number.
- Are you mad?

360
00:26:29,468 --> 00:26:31,527
Will your parents let
you marry a foreigner?

361
00:26:31,837 --> 00:26:34,829
What's the problem?
What's the problem?

362
00:26:35,941 --> 00:26:38,375
If you don't want me to marry, fine.

363
00:26:38,844 --> 00:26:41,904
But what's the harm in having
fun before marriage, dude?

364
00:26:44,349 --> 00:26:47,807
God, what am I hearing!

365
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:50,445
Do one thing. Call her.
What's that fair girl's name?

366
00:26:50,989 --> 00:26:52,115
I will tell you what to say.

367
00:26:54,026 --> 00:26:56,867
Why are you standing there?
Come on the bed!

368
00:26:56,868 --> 00:26:57,120
Yes.

369
00:27:02,034 --> 00:27:03,831
First tell me what to say?

370
00:27:06,204 --> 00:27:07,865
This fool!

371
00:27:14,379 --> 00:27:15,437
What happened?

372
00:27:16,515 --> 00:27:17,914
Terrible!
- What happened?

373
00:27:18,216 --> 00:27:20,480
It's terrible!
- Tell me what happened?

374
00:27:20,585 --> 00:27:24,214
I thought my nephew
is a meek fellow.

375
00:27:24,356 --> 00:27:26,950
But that fool is a gay!

376
00:27:27,059 --> 00:27:28,356
No, no. I can't believe this.

377
00:27:28,427 --> 00:27:29,917
You don't believe it.
- No.

378
00:27:29,995 --> 00:27:31,462
Hear it for yourself.

379
00:27:33,532 --> 00:27:35,591
Come. Hear it.

380
00:27:35,867 --> 00:27:37,391
Darling, you love me too?

381
00:27:38,236 --> 00:27:44,072
I love you madly, deeply, truly.
- Hey! Hey!

382
00:27:44,142 --> 00:27:46,406
Where are you going?
Where are you going?

383
00:27:46,478 --> 00:27:48,139
You will be in trouble!
You will be in trouble!

384
00:27:48,213 --> 00:27:50,238
Where are you going?

385
00:27:50,315 --> 00:27:52,306
Uncle! Aunt! Had any work?

386
00:27:52,484 --> 00:27:54,611
You have slandered us!

387
00:27:55,187 --> 00:27:57,553
You have tarnished
our family's image!

388
00:27:57,656 --> 00:28:00,386
This guy has ruined his life!
- Me?

389
00:28:00,492 --> 00:28:02,148
Neel, run!

390
00:28:02,149 --> 00:28:05,293
- Hey wait!
- Leave!

391
00:28:05,364 --> 00:28:08,197
This old man has been mistaken!

392
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:10,028
Hey run!
- Sunny! Sunny!

393
00:28:10,029 --> 00:28:11,895
Run!
- What happened to him?

394
00:28:13,071 --> 00:28:15,005
Stop! Calm down!

395
00:28:15,307 --> 00:28:17,901
Hang on! Listen to me!

396
00:28:18,076 --> 00:28:20,010
Calm down!
- I won't spare you!

397
00:28:20,078 --> 00:28:21,909
Calm down!
- You harass me in this old age!

398
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:24,448
...Calm down! Calm down!

399
00:28:33,325 --> 00:28:35,657
Neel! Listen!

400
00:28:35,961 --> 00:28:37,428
Where were you?
- How are you, Sunny?

401
00:28:37,496 --> 00:28:39,487
I was looking for you, dude!
- Why? What happened?

402
00:28:39,598 --> 00:28:41,498
Yesterday my cell gave me a problem!

403
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,999
And my uncle too!

404
00:28:43,101 --> 00:28:44,432
Your uncle had gone mad yesterday!

405
00:28:44,603 --> 00:28:46,662
If you will hear this, you
will fall down, dude!

406
00:28:46,938 --> 00:28:48,030
Why? What happened?

407
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:51,034
He is thinking we are gay!
- What!

408
00:28:51,443 --> 00:28:53,240
Yes! You are laughing!

409
00:28:53,345 --> 00:28:54,403
You look like one!

410
00:28:55,313 --> 00:28:58,510
He is thinking you are
the main boss, dude!

411
00:28:58,617 --> 00:28:59,675
You have spoilt me!

412
00:29:00,085 --> 00:29:02,019
That uncle is crazy!

413
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:04,688
What will he do?
- He is a dangerous man!

414
00:29:05,323 --> 00:29:09,316
Just be aware! Be careful of him!
- Okay!

415
00:29:09,461 --> 00:29:09,951
Hey!

416
00:29:09,952 --> 00:29:12,157
Sweetheart!
- Hi!

417
00:29:13,131 --> 00:29:14,325
I will just come!
I will meet you later!

418
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:17,960
Just be careful! Be aware!
Be aware! Remember that!

419
00:29:18,036 --> 00:29:19,094
Be careful, Neel!

420
00:29:23,341 --> 00:29:23,637
Sorry!

421
00:29:23,638 --> 00:29:24,968
You are late!
- I am late!

422
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:26,475
That's okay!

423
00:29:29,448 --> 00:29:30,506
What happened?

424
00:29:33,718 --> 00:29:35,481
Look! Look!
He is there!

425
00:29:35,554 --> 00:29:37,044
What happened?
- Run! Run!

426
00:29:37,556 --> 00:29:39,615
Catch! Catch! Catch!

427
00:29:39,691 --> 00:29:40,988
Neel, what happened?

428
00:29:42,127 --> 00:29:43,389
Neel!

429
00:29:43,595 --> 00:29:45,495
Catch him!

430
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:54,095
Catch him! Catch him!

431
00:30:00,011 --> 00:30:02,002
Neel, why are we running?

432
00:30:15,393 --> 00:30:18,021
Where did he go?
Where is that dirty man?

433
00:30:20,699 --> 00:30:24,601
He ran away! Oh God!

434
00:30:25,203 --> 00:30:30,766
Hey! Oh God!

435
00:30:33,612 --> 00:30:34,636
Neel!
- Run! Run!

436
00:30:34,713 --> 00:30:36,044
Now at least tell me, Neel!

437
00:30:39,718 --> 00:30:41,049
I will tell you!

438
00:30:42,087 --> 00:30:45,056
Neel! Why are we running?
- I will tell you!

439
00:30:45,123 --> 00:30:47,591
And who were they?
- I will tell you! Let me catch my breath!

440
00:30:47,692 --> 00:30:48,750
No! Tell me now!

441
00:30:49,528 --> 00:30:51,359
Shall I tell you?
- Yes!

442
00:30:53,798 --> 00:30:55,265
Shall I tell you?
- Yes!

443
00:30:56,434 --> 00:30:58,595
Think!
- Yes!

444
00:31:42,447 --> 00:31:47,214
Your tresses are wet, wet, wet.

445
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:52,757
Bangles on your fair,
fair, fair hands.

446
00:31:53,858 --> 00:31:58,625
On your lips, this tint,
tint, tint.

447
00:31:59,497 --> 00:32:04,298
There is no such tint
in the whole world.

448
00:32:05,503 --> 00:32:10,805
Smile once and say yes.

449
00:32:11,142 --> 00:32:14,236
I won't ask anything
else from God.

450
00:32:14,346 --> 00:32:19,147
Your tresses are wet, wet, wet.

451
00:32:19,351 --> 00:32:24,448
Bangles on your fair,
fair, fair hands.

452
00:32:47,345 --> 00:32:49,905
On the lanes of stars.

453
00:32:50,181 --> 00:32:52,741
You have walked.

454
00:32:54,452 --> 00:32:58,912
On the ground of my fancy.

455
00:33:00,225 --> 00:33:04,389
How do I thank you?

456
00:33:07,232 --> 00:33:09,860
Stealing from the springs.

457
00:33:10,201 --> 00:33:12,635
You have brought fragrance.

458
00:33:14,406 --> 00:33:19,309
I was searching for you
since a long time.

459
00:33:20,211 --> 00:33:24,272
You have made me crazy.

460
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:30,879
Once smile and say yes.

461
00:33:30,955 --> 00:33:34,322
I won't ask anything
else from God.

462
00:33:34,426 --> 00:33:38,624
Your tresses are wet, wet, wet.

463
00:33:39,564 --> 00:33:44,592
Bangles on your fair,
fair, fair hands.

464
00:34:13,264 --> 00:34:15,255
I will dwell you in my shelter.

465
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,659
I will adorn you on my lips.

466
00:34:19,904 --> 00:34:25,399
Today I will do insolence.

467
00:34:25,643 --> 00:34:29,841
But my heart is afraid.

468
00:34:33,017 --> 00:34:35,485
I will caress your tresses.

469
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:38,316
I will lose control.

470
00:34:40,024 --> 00:34:45,428
I will embrace you today.

471
00:34:45,663 --> 00:34:49,895
If you give me the sign.

472
00:34:51,035 --> 00:34:56,735
Smile once and say yes.

473
00:34:56,975 --> 00:35:00,308
I won't ask anything
else from God.

474
00:35:00,445 --> 00:35:05,041
Your tresses are wet, wet, wet.

475
00:35:05,316 --> 00:35:10,379
Bangles on your fair,
fair, fair hands.

476
00:35:10,989 --> 00:35:15,858
On your lips, this tint,
tint, tint.

477
00:35:16,461 --> 00:35:21,694
There is no such tint
in the whole world.

478
00:35:27,505 --> 00:35:29,530
Hello!
Hello, Volga restaurant?

479
00:35:29,641 --> 00:35:31,871
Volga restaurant!
Julia Smith speaking.

480
00:35:31,976 --> 00:35:33,910
This is Sunny Malhotra
from New York City!

481
00:35:34,012 --> 00:35:35,411
Okay, sir.

482
00:35:35,513 --> 00:35:37,344
I would like to have a
reservation for two

483
00:35:37,415 --> 00:35:39,645
for a special birthday.

484
00:35:39,751 --> 00:35:41,776
Sure! Sure!
We can do that for you!

485
00:35:51,095 --> 00:35:54,861
Hello! Hi, Jaspreet!
Anything special?

486
00:35:55,033 --> 00:35:58,366
Your brother, my cousin
Sunny Malhotra...

487
00:35:58,436 --> 00:36:02,372
...he is taking an American girl
to an expensive restaurant

488
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,374
to celebrate her birthday.
- What!

489
00:36:04,709 --> 00:36:07,371
I am still young.

490
00:36:07,445 --> 00:36:09,811
I am still young.

491
00:36:09,914 --> 00:36:11,575
Hey, damsel!

492
00:36:12,584 --> 00:36:16,486
In old age too, you are too much.
- Yes.

493
00:36:16,588 --> 00:36:18,453
You are the father of a
young daughter and son.

494
00:36:18,556 --> 00:36:20,581
And still you think you are young!

495
00:36:20,758 --> 00:36:24,489
Do you doubt my youth? Come!

496
00:36:24,596 --> 00:36:26,461
Daddy! Daddy!

497
00:36:27,565 --> 00:36:29,533
Dear, what happened?

498
00:36:29,667 --> 00:36:30,725
Daddy, Sunny!

499
00:36:30,802 --> 00:36:32,429
Sunny has come! My son has come!

500
00:36:32,504 --> 00:36:33,528
No!
- My son!

501
00:36:33,605 --> 00:36:36,506
Your son is having an
affair in America!

502
00:36:36,774 --> 00:36:41,006
Affair? Is it a girl?
- Who knows? Maybe!

503
00:36:41,079 --> 00:36:43,013
Oh my God!

504
00:36:43,114 --> 00:36:46,777
No, it's a foreigner!
- A foreigner!

505
00:36:46,885 --> 00:36:47,943
Oh my God!

506
00:36:48,019 --> 00:36:49,077
Daddy, you know.

507
00:36:49,153 --> 00:36:52,418
Today Sunny has booked an
expensive restaurant

508
00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:55,926
to celebrate that
fair lady's birthday.

509
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,788
Your son is splurging
your hard earned money.

510
00:36:58,863 --> 00:37:03,095
Dear! I had sent you
to America to study!

511
00:37:03,468 --> 00:37:05,060
And you have gone far ahead!

512
00:37:05,169 --> 00:37:07,433
-

513
00:37:07,505 --> 00:37:09,063
Then what!

514
00:37:09,173 --> 00:37:12,438
In entire New York he found only a foreigner!
- Exactly...

515
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:15,536
Was there a dearth of Punjabi girls!
- Right.

516
00:37:15,813 --> 00:37:18,043
Now! Call my brother-in-law
Jaswinder right away!

517
00:37:18,149 --> 00:37:20,982
Keep quiet!
You don't know my brother!

518
00:37:21,052 --> 00:37:22,883
I know him very well!

519
00:37:23,187 --> 00:37:27,089
Our looks are similar! But not our brains!
- Yes!

520
00:37:27,458 --> 00:37:29,449
He too is a flirt like Sunny!
- Yes!

521
00:37:29,527 --> 00:37:31,927
Dear, go and get my diary.
- Yes!

522
00:37:31,996 --> 00:37:34,692
I will call my cousin Tony!

523
00:37:34,866 --> 00:37:37,892
Where is the cashier!
Where is the cashier!

524
00:37:37,969 --> 00:37:39,766
...Tony has come! Why are
you creating a noise!

525
00:37:39,871 --> 00:37:40,963
Move it aside!

526
00:37:41,072 --> 00:37:43,905
I have come! I have come!
Hang on! Hang on!

527
00:37:43,975 --> 00:37:45,067
Hang on!

528
00:37:45,843 --> 00:37:46,486
What do you have?

529
00:37:46,487 --> 00:37:47,470
Here is my stuff.
- Wait.

530
00:37:48,146 --> 00:37:49,841
Hang on!
- Come on!

531
00:37:49,948 --> 00:37:50,703
Hello!

532
00:37:50,704 --> 00:37:54,476
Tony! Greetings!
- Greetings!

533
00:37:54,552 --> 00:37:57,851
I have got a very big problem, Tony!

534
00:37:57,956 --> 00:38:00,891
What problem?
- That problem is called Sunny!

535
00:38:01,025 --> 00:38:03,220
Finally we are here!

536
00:38:04,162 --> 00:38:06,995
This is all for you!
- Wow! Beautiful!

537
00:38:07,065 --> 00:38:08,157
That is our table!

538
00:38:08,232 --> 00:38:09,314
Hey!
- Hey!

539
00:38:09,315 --> 00:38:10,666
Rajesh!
- Sunny!

540
00:38:10,768 --> 00:38:13,032
How are you? What
are you doing here?

541
00:38:13,137 --> 00:38:14,502
Why? Can't I come here?

542
00:38:14,572 --> 00:38:15,971
No, no, no!

543
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,167
After leaving college I
saw you driving a cab.

544
00:38:18,242 --> 00:38:19,709
That's why I asked you.
- That was so long ago.

545
00:38:19,811 --> 00:38:22,143
Okay!
What new thing have you started?

546
00:38:22,246 --> 00:38:25,147
I have started a business
of BPO call centre.

547
00:38:25,249 --> 00:38:27,979
Earlier I used to
drive other's cars.

548
00:38:28,252 --> 00:38:30,152
Now others drive my car!

549
00:38:30,254 --> 00:38:33,883
That's the beauty of life, man! Wow!

550
00:38:34,192 --> 00:38:36,251
At times this and at times that!

551
00:38:36,661 --> 00:38:38,629
Nice to see you, dude!

552
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:40,129
I think I will better
let you guys go.

553
00:38:40,264 --> 00:38:42,892
Do one thing. Here is my business card.
- Thank you.

554
00:38:43,001 --> 00:38:44,059
You can call me anytime.

555
00:38:44,135 --> 00:38:46,126
By the way she is Tina, my fiance.

556
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:47,737
Hi.
- Hi, how are you?

557
00:38:50,141 --> 00:38:52,541
Enough!
It's her birthday today!

558
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:53,770
Really?
- Yes! Yes!

559
00:38:53,878 --> 00:38:55,641
Happy birthday!
- Thanks!

560
00:38:57,215 --> 00:38:59,274
It's enough! Enough!

561
00:38:59,784 --> 00:39:01,547
Yes! Yes! Yes!
- Okay!

562
00:39:01,619 --> 00:39:02,377
Enjoy yourself!

563
00:39:02,378 --> 00:39:02,984
Bye!
- Bye!

564
00:39:03,154 --> 00:39:04,621
Go to hell!

565
00:39:06,557 --> 00:39:07,615
Good evening!

566
00:39:08,926 --> 00:39:10,154
May I get you something to drink?

567
00:39:10,261 --> 00:39:12,058
Yes. You first.

568
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:14,095
I will have a margarita please.

569
00:39:14,298 --> 00:39:17,563
I will have... Johnny Walker
black, on the rocks...

570
00:39:17,635 --> 00:39:18,693
Sure, sir.
- Thank you.

571
00:39:18,936 --> 00:39:21,928
I am so happy!
- Baby!

572
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,941
Happy birthday to you!
Happy birthday to you!

573
00:39:25,243 --> 00:39:28,838
Happy birthday to Tina!
Happy birthday to you!

574
00:39:29,113 --> 00:39:32,844
Happy birthday to dear Tina!

575
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:34,212
Come on!
- Wow!

576
00:39:34,318 --> 00:39:36,582
Tina! It's all for you, baby!

577
00:39:36,654 --> 00:39:40,112
Happy birthday to you!
Happy birthday to you!

578
00:39:40,191 --> 00:39:41,249
Candle first! Candle first!
- Okay!

579
00:39:41,325 --> 00:39:44,021
Happy birthday to Tina!
Happy birthday to you!

580
00:39:44,762 --> 00:39:46,957
Happy birthday, Tina!

581
00:39:47,765 --> 00:39:51,030
Sunny darling, thank you!
- My pleasure!

582
00:39:57,341 --> 00:40:00,777
This drunkard! From where
did this drunkard come?

583
00:40:01,813 --> 00:40:04,907
Wow, Sunny!
You even hired Indian dancers!

584
00:40:05,016 --> 00:40:06,608
Yes, yes, yes!

585
00:40:06,951 --> 00:40:08,248
Sit!

586
00:40:08,352 --> 00:40:11,253
No, no, he is not a dancer!
He has come to play the music!

587
00:40:11,656 --> 00:40:15,251
I have taught many people
a lesson! You are nobody!

588
00:40:15,993 --> 00:40:18,257
Uncle! Aunt! You and here?

589
00:40:18,362 --> 00:40:19,989
Your father had called!
- Yes!

590
00:40:20,064 --> 00:40:21,725
He is very angry with you!
- Yes!

591
00:40:21,833 --> 00:40:23,630
On the phone he was
saying that you are

592
00:40:23,701 --> 00:40:25,635
having an affair with an American.

593
00:40:25,703 --> 00:40:26,761
Me? Thank you!

594
00:40:26,838 --> 00:40:28,703
But how did dad find out?

595
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,137
Sunny, what happened?

596
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:32,199
Nothing, Tina darling!
Nothing! Have cake!

597
00:40:32,276 --> 00:40:33,368
Tina!
- Don't worry, sweetie!

598
00:40:33,644 --> 00:40:36,204
Tina!
You made his life hell!

599
00:40:36,314 --> 00:40:39,147
Cake? Happy birthday?
- Yes! Yes!

600
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:41,241
Happy birthday! Happy birthday!
Happy birthday!

601
00:40:41,319 --> 00:40:42,650
Happy birthday!

602
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,779
What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

603
00:40:44,922 --> 00:40:46,753
He is a dangerous man!

604
00:40:47,024 --> 00:40:51,654
This man is playing with you!
He will make you pregnant!

605
00:40:53,798 --> 00:40:55,095
He is lying! He is lying!

606
00:40:55,333 --> 00:40:57,301
No, no, no! I will tell
you his history!

607
00:40:57,401 --> 00:40:59,028
In India! Shut up!

608
00:40:59,137 --> 00:41:04,871
In India he made 5 girls pregnant!
- You!

609
00:41:04,942 --> 00:41:07,672
Sunny, I don't want to see
your face ever again!

610
00:41:07,745 --> 00:41:09,679
Get out of here!
- No!

611
00:41:10,047 --> 00:41:11,776
I am leaving!

612
00:41:12,049 --> 00:41:13,311
She slapped me too!

613
00:41:20,057 --> 00:41:21,285
Sunny, I don't want to see
your face ever again!

614
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:23,122
Please! Please! Please!

615
00:41:23,227 --> 00:41:25,161
Listen! Listen! Listen!

616
00:41:25,363 --> 00:41:27,422
Tina, listen! Please!

617
00:41:27,698 --> 00:41:28,995
How could you, Sunny?

618
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:32,126
You slept with all those girls
and made them pregnant!

619
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:35,339
Tina, that was Mary!
My ex-girlfriend!

620
00:41:35,406 --> 00:41:38,000
I told you about her!
I didn't make her pregnant!

621
00:41:38,109 --> 00:41:40,236
You are lying. Your uncle told me.

622
00:41:40,311 --> 00:41:43,144
You slept with 4-5 girls and
made all of them pregnant.

623
00:41:43,247 --> 00:41:45,715
Such a stupid uncle!
I will kick him!

624
00:41:46,083 --> 00:41:49,109
I swear to God!
Have I made you pregnant till now?

625
00:41:49,253 --> 00:41:51,448
You know me!
I am very serious about you!

626
00:41:51,722 --> 00:41:53,713
I love you so much!
I love you so much!

627
00:41:54,792 --> 00:41:56,054
Last time, Sunny!

628
00:41:56,127 --> 00:41:58,254
And if it wasn't for you,
I wouldn't be here now.

629
00:41:58,796 --> 00:42:01,458
Thank you!
I can't live without you!

630
00:42:02,066 --> 00:42:04,728
Neel, I repair it every time!

631
00:42:04,802 --> 00:42:06,963
Neel, I always fix this
but you spoil it.

632
00:42:07,038 --> 00:42:08,801
Tell me something, Neel.

633
00:42:09,073 --> 00:42:10,472
It's been one year.

634
00:42:10,808 --> 00:42:13,436
You didn't tell me anything
about your parents.

635
00:42:13,811 --> 00:42:16,939
Mother passed away when
I was eight years old.

636
00:42:17,014 --> 00:42:18,072
I am sorry.

637
00:42:18,149 --> 00:42:19,207
My dad brought me up.

638
00:42:19,283 --> 00:42:20,750
He didn't get married again.

639
00:42:20,818 --> 00:42:22,342
But he is more like a friend to me.

640
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:23,478
That's so sweet.

641
00:42:24,322 --> 00:42:26,153
Is this book yours?
- Yes.

642
00:42:26,357 --> 00:42:27,415
Interesting.

643
00:42:27,491 --> 00:42:29,254
Can I borrow it?
- Yes sure, why not.

644
00:42:29,327 --> 00:42:32,023
But don't lose it and don't
lend it to anyone.

645
00:42:32,096 --> 00:42:33,961
Grandma has given it to me,
so keep it properly.

646
00:42:34,031 --> 00:42:35,089
You know, I won't.

647
00:42:35,166 --> 00:42:36,758
Alright, I think you are all set.

648
00:42:36,834 --> 00:42:38,028
I have fixed the wires.

649
00:42:38,102 --> 00:42:39,501
Don't spoil it again, okay.

650
00:42:40,104 --> 00:42:41,833
I will see you tomorrow.
- Okay.

651
00:42:41,906 --> 00:42:45,467
Thank you. Take care.

652
00:42:46,344 --> 00:42:47,902
See you.
- See you.

653
00:42:47,979 --> 00:42:49,970
Don't be late.
- Bye.

654
00:42:51,349 --> 00:42:52,407
Oh no.

655
00:42:54,385 --> 00:42:55,443
There he is.

656
00:42:55,987 --> 00:42:58,353
Neel.
- Uncle, how are you?

657
00:42:59,123 --> 00:43:01,853
Where is your useless friend, Sunny?

658
00:43:02,126 --> 00:43:07,850
Just tell me, what he is doing with
that foreigner girl.

659
00:43:07,851 --> 00:43:09,055
Tell us son.

660
00:43:10,868 --> 00:43:11,960
You are mistaken.

661
00:43:12,036 --> 00:43:17,030
I am mistaken or are you
aiding your friend.

662
00:43:17,108 --> 00:43:18,871
Where is Sunny?

663
00:43:18,943 --> 00:43:19,967
He must be on his way.

664
00:43:20,044 --> 00:43:21,807
Maya has forgotten her keys.

665
00:43:21,879 --> 00:43:22,937
I will just go and
return it to her.

666
00:43:23,014 --> 00:43:24,140
Please hold.
- Go and give it to her.

667
00:43:24,215 --> 00:43:25,375
Return it to her quickly.

668
00:43:25,449 --> 00:43:26,882
I have some business with you.

669
00:43:26,951 --> 00:43:28,009
Definitely uncle, you just hold on.

670
00:43:28,085 --> 00:43:29,814
I will be back in 2 minutes.

671
00:43:29,887 --> 00:43:30,979
Go son.

672
00:43:39,430 --> 00:43:40,488
Sunny!

673
00:43:46,337 --> 00:43:48,396
I want to have the best
time of my life.

674
00:44:02,186 --> 00:44:03,244
Come on.

675
00:44:05,389 --> 00:44:06,447
Kiss me.

676
00:44:09,927 --> 00:44:12,862
Oh God, I feel ashamed!

677
00:44:12,930 --> 00:44:15,160
How they have embraced each other.

678
00:44:15,232 --> 00:44:18,201
Why are you feeling ashamed
if they are embracing?

679
00:44:18,269 --> 00:44:19,998
Separate them! Separate them!

680
00:44:20,938 --> 00:44:23,304
What do you want me to do,
go inside the computer?

681
00:44:25,209 --> 00:44:27,074
You idiot, what are you are doing?
- What a nice girl.

682
00:44:28,379 --> 00:44:30,074
I am feeling jealous.

683
00:44:30,147 --> 00:44:31,205
Sunny.

684
00:44:34,452 --> 00:44:35,510
Just a minute.

685
00:44:41,225 --> 00:44:43,022
Who is disturbing me now?

686
00:44:45,429 --> 00:44:46,487
Hi dad.

687
00:44:46,964 --> 00:44:50,297
Son, you have floored your dad.

688
00:44:50,968 --> 00:44:52,959
What? I didn't understand dad.

689
00:44:53,037 --> 00:44:55,631
Where are you? And
what are you doing?

690
00:44:55,973 --> 00:44:58,965
I am studying dad, in the library.

691
00:44:59,243 --> 00:45:00,972
I can see that.

692
00:45:01,045 --> 00:45:02,637
What are you studying for, son.

693
00:45:03,514 --> 00:45:04,640
For MBA, dad.

694
00:45:05,983 --> 00:45:08,975
So, in MBA you have
to study medical too?

695
00:45:10,988 --> 00:45:12,046
No.

696
00:45:12,123 --> 00:45:15,422
You fool, then why are
you feeling her nerves?

697
00:45:15,993 --> 00:45:17,119
What?

698
00:45:18,262 --> 00:45:19,991
Tell me the truth, where are you?

699
00:45:20,064 --> 00:45:21,463
I am in the library, dad.

700
00:45:21,532 --> 00:45:23,397
What are you doing?
- Studying.

701
00:45:24,001 --> 00:45:25,935
I have made up my mind
that this year...

702
00:45:26,003 --> 00:45:28,631
...I have to top in MBA
and become Anil Ambani.

703
00:45:30,007 --> 00:45:31,998
You think so much, son.

704
00:45:33,144 --> 00:45:34,941
Anil Ambani brought Tina after...

705
00:45:35,012 --> 00:45:37,003
...but you brought Tina...

706
00:45:37,081 --> 00:45:39,515
...before you could
become Anil Ambani.

707
00:45:40,017 --> 00:45:41,609
How can you become Anil Ambani?

708
00:45:45,022 --> 00:45:46,489
Don't look here and there.

709
00:45:47,024 --> 00:45:50,289
I and your mother can see
everything that you are doing.

710
00:45:50,361 --> 00:45:51,419
Yes.

711
00:45:52,563 --> 00:45:54,155
Have you come to America?

712
00:45:54,231 --> 00:45:55,698
Don't jump.

713
00:45:56,467 --> 00:45:58,697
Why aren't you talking, son?

714
00:45:59,970 --> 00:46:01,028
Sorry guys.

715
00:46:01,305 --> 00:46:02,533
All three of them are there now.

716
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,098
God!

717
00:46:06,477 --> 00:46:10,675
Bad news guys, the web-cam was on.
- What about your youth now!

718
00:46:12,316 --> 00:46:13,374
Disconnected the phone.

719
00:46:13,451 --> 00:46:14,577
Have fun.

720
00:46:24,562 --> 00:46:26,530
I am dead.

721
00:46:30,201 --> 00:46:33,261
Neel, this time on birthday you
will take me to Hawaii islands.

722
00:46:33,337 --> 00:46:34,497
Of course I will.

723
00:46:34,572 --> 00:46:36,563
Why just Hawaii, I will
take you to Macau.

724
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:37,732
It will really be cool.

725
00:46:37,808 --> 00:46:39,241
Here is your mall.
- Come on.

726
00:46:40,611 --> 00:46:43,079
So tell me.
- Do your shopping.

727
00:46:43,147 --> 00:46:44,739
Tell me, Neel.

728
00:46:45,349 --> 00:46:46,509
Neel, please.

729
00:46:48,085 --> 00:46:50,383
Hey Neel, look at that guy.

730
00:46:51,088 --> 00:46:53,079
Why has he come in a woman's store?

731
00:46:53,157 --> 00:46:54,215
Do you like him?

732
00:46:54,291 --> 00:46:57,089
No way, I hate boys with earrings.

733
00:46:57,361 --> 00:46:59,591
I thought you want me
to wear earrings too.

734
00:47:00,364 --> 00:47:01,626
Come on.

735
00:47:03,567 --> 00:47:05,091
Wow, so beautiful.

736
00:47:05,169 --> 00:47:06,227
Who, me?

737
00:47:06,303 --> 00:47:07,361
No, the scarf's.

738
00:47:07,438 --> 00:47:08,496
Look, aren't they cute.

739
00:47:10,541 --> 00:47:11,735
You mean not me.

740
00:47:11,809 --> 00:47:13,367
I don't mean that.

741
00:47:13,444 --> 00:47:14,570
Tell me Neel, how is it?

742
00:47:16,647 --> 00:47:17,705
Beautiful.

743
00:47:18,115 --> 00:47:20,606
Who are you referring to,
me or the scarf?

744
00:47:20,684 --> 00:47:21,742
The scarf.

745
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:25,054
I am joking, you are so beautiful...

746
00:47:25,122 --> 00:47:27,113
...any scarf will look good on you.

747
00:47:27,191 --> 00:47:28,249
Really.

748
00:47:28,325 --> 00:47:29,792
Then tell me, which colour you like.

749
00:47:31,395 --> 00:47:33,124
Look, this one is good.
- Nice.

750
00:47:34,398 --> 00:47:35,456
There are two of them.

751
00:47:35,533 --> 00:47:37,125
But both are alike.

752
00:47:37,201 --> 00:47:39,567
There is a 50% discount,
take both of them.

753
00:47:39,637 --> 00:47:41,434
Neel, you are too much.
- Come on.

754
00:47:46,143 --> 00:47:47,201
Promise me.

755
00:47:47,278 --> 00:47:50,645
You will always keep it with
you as my memorabilia.

756
00:47:52,149 --> 00:47:56,449
Wherever you go in life, a part
of me will always be with you.

757
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:58,818
Why do you watch so many films?

758
00:47:59,423 --> 00:48:01,084
How mean, Neel.

759
00:48:01,158 --> 00:48:02,489
Come on, promise me.

760
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:03,618
I promise you.

761
00:48:05,429 --> 00:48:06,657
Let's go, come on.

762
00:48:10,601 --> 00:48:12,091
I am Sunny's uncle.

763
00:48:12,436 --> 00:48:13,494
You called me.

764
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:17,839
Why are you staring at me?

765
00:48:19,176 --> 00:48:20,666
You...
- What happened?

766
00:48:20,744 --> 00:48:23,713
Get out! Get out! Get out!

767
00:48:23,781 --> 00:48:25,112
Surprising! First of
all you call people...

768
00:48:25,182 --> 00:48:27,582
...and then you throw them out.

769
00:48:28,185 --> 00:48:30,380
You think I am a fool.
- What?

770
00:48:30,454 --> 00:48:31,512
Am I a fool?

771
00:48:32,189 --> 00:48:34,453
You have come wearing
this white hair wig.

772
00:48:34,525 --> 00:48:35,583
What are you saying?

773
00:48:35,659 --> 00:48:36,717
You are trying to fool me.
- That's not it.

774
00:48:36,794 --> 00:48:38,625
Take it off!
- Take it off!

775
00:48:39,196 --> 00:48:40,458
You idiot.

776
00:48:40,531 --> 00:48:41,589
You are pulling my hair.

777
00:48:41,665 --> 00:48:43,724
- I will see how you resist!
- Hey, hey!

778
00:48:43,801 --> 00:48:46,326
Hey officer, look have you gone mad!

779
00:48:46,403 --> 00:48:47,870
Have you gone mad!

780
00:48:48,205 --> 00:48:49,797
You are pulling my hair.

781
00:48:50,207 --> 00:48:51,469
Troubling an old man.

782
00:48:51,542 --> 00:48:54,477
What's your problem?
- Sorry.

783
00:48:54,545 --> 00:48:55,739
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

784
00:48:55,813 --> 00:48:57,212
The hair is real.

785
00:48:57,281 --> 00:48:59,215
You think they are fake?

786
00:48:59,283 --> 00:49:00,682
I have bought it from somewhere.

787
00:49:00,751 --> 00:49:01,809
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!

788
00:49:01,885 --> 00:49:03,716
Your face... face...

789
00:49:04,221 --> 00:49:08,555
It looks exactly like Sunny.

790
00:49:09,493 --> 00:49:14,187
Officer. Sunny's father
and I are twins.

791
00:49:14,188 --> 00:49:14,760
Okay.

792
00:49:14,832 --> 00:49:16,561
And Sunny is the triplet.

793
00:49:16,634 --> 00:49:17,828
Take a seat.

794
00:49:17,901 --> 00:49:19,493
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!

795
00:49:19,570 --> 00:49:22,403
You must have felt bad that
I pulled your hair, isn't it.

796
00:49:22,473 --> 00:49:23,599
You must have felt bad.

797
00:49:23,674 --> 00:49:25,164
Forgive me.

798
00:49:25,242 --> 00:49:27,369
You think I will feel happy.

799
00:49:27,444 --> 00:49:28,502
I am sorry.

800
00:49:28,579 --> 00:49:31,173
Your hair is real, but
the problem is that...

801
00:49:31,248 --> 00:49:34,240
...I feel very bad because
I am an Indian.

802
00:49:34,318 --> 00:49:35,512
And a student counsellor.

803
00:49:35,586 --> 00:49:38,180
So whenever I see
an Indian student...

804
00:49:38,255 --> 00:49:40,450
...going on the wrong path,
I feel very bad.

805
00:49:40,524 --> 00:49:41,684
That's why I have called you.

806
00:49:41,759 --> 00:49:42,919
Please explain to him.

807
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:44,386
Please explain to him.

808
00:49:44,461 --> 00:49:46,725
What should I explain
to him, officer?

809
00:49:46,797 --> 00:49:48,264
What should I explain to him?

810
00:49:49,266 --> 00:49:53,703
Sunny hasn't come to America
to make us proud.

811
00:49:53,771 --> 00:49:58,538
He has come here to defame
us and our family name.

812
00:49:58,609 --> 00:49:59,667
That's what I am telling you.

813
00:49:59,743 --> 00:50:03,804
He has been failing
for the past 3 years.

814
00:50:03,881 --> 00:50:06,941
He doesn't study, then
how can he pass.

815
00:50:07,551 --> 00:50:08,711
What kind of an uncle are you?

816
00:50:08,786 --> 00:50:10,481
Take a look, what kind
of an uncle am I?

817
00:50:10,554 --> 00:50:12,545
Explain him, that's what
I am telling you.

818
00:50:12,623 --> 00:50:14,215
I can't explain to him.

819
00:50:14,291 --> 00:50:15,349
Listen to me, first listen to me.

820
00:50:15,426 --> 00:50:16,518
I will shoot him.

821
00:50:16,593 --> 00:50:17,855
Don't shoot him.

822
00:50:17,928 --> 00:50:21,227
Yesterday, he was caught in
the bathroom with a girl.

823
00:50:22,566 --> 00:50:24,932
What are you saying?
- I am telling the truth.

824
00:50:25,302 --> 00:50:26,963
Please say it once more.

825
00:50:27,304 --> 00:50:30,831
Yesterday, he was caught in
the bathroom with a girl.

826
00:50:31,308 --> 00:50:34,709
My Sunny was caught with
a girl in the bathroom.

827
00:50:35,312 --> 00:50:38,577
Congratulations! Congratulations!

828
00:50:38,816 --> 00:50:40,613
My family is saved from being gay.

829
00:50:40,684 --> 00:50:42,914
My Sunny is not a gay!

830
00:50:42,986 --> 00:50:45,318
My Sunny is not a gay!

831
00:50:54,865 --> 00:50:57,561
Thank you, waiting for me.

832
00:50:57,634 --> 00:50:58,999
Tina baby.

833
00:50:59,336 --> 00:51:00,667
I don't want to talk to you now.

834
00:51:00,738 --> 00:51:01,796
Why?

835
00:51:02,339 --> 00:51:04,000
I couldn't sleep last night.

836
00:51:04,608 --> 00:51:06,872
Because you embarrassed me
in front of your family.

837
00:51:06,944 --> 00:51:09,344
No, no, no it's not my fault.

838
00:51:09,413 --> 00:51:12,280
You know, my mom and dad
gave me a lecture about...

839
00:51:12,349 --> 00:51:14,909
...the need for me to settle
down everything.

840
00:51:15,619 --> 00:51:17,018
I think they are right.

841
00:51:17,488 --> 00:51:19,922
Laugh please, forgive me. Laugh.

842
00:51:21,859 --> 00:51:23,952
This is for you.
- Thank you.

843
00:51:24,027 --> 00:51:26,427
And this is for you.
- Thank you.

844
00:51:26,497 --> 00:51:29,022
And now I have to say something.

845
00:51:29,633 --> 00:51:33,694
Would you marry me, Tina baby?

846
00:51:36,373 --> 00:51:38,568
What happened now?
- Come on, come on, come on.

847
00:51:38,642 --> 00:51:40,041
Sunny...
- Fast, fast, fast.

848
00:51:40,377 --> 00:51:42,038
Sunny, where are you taking me?

849
00:51:42,379 --> 00:51:44,813
What's the matter?
- Sunny.

850
00:51:45,382 --> 00:51:46,781
What's going on, Sunny?

851
00:51:47,651 --> 00:51:50,381
Sunny Wait for me.

852
00:51:51,655 --> 00:51:52,713
Wait for me, Sunny.

853
00:51:52,790 --> 00:51:53,848
Come on, come on.

854
00:51:53,924 --> 00:51:56,392
Why are we walking so fast?

855
00:51:56,460 --> 00:51:58,394
It's very good for health.

856
00:51:58,462 --> 00:51:59,656
Makes your happy.

857
00:51:59,730 --> 00:52:00,788
Wait.

858
00:52:00,864 --> 00:52:01,922
What are you talking about?

859
00:52:01,999 --> 00:52:03,032
It's great timing baby.

860
00:52:03,033 --> 00:52:03,660
What?
- What?

861
00:52:03,734 --> 00:52:04,860
I will tell you later?

862
00:52:04,935 --> 00:52:06,869
Come on, come on.
- Come.

863
00:52:10,541 --> 00:52:11,599
Sunny!

864
00:52:12,676 --> 00:52:13,734
Sunny!

865
00:52:16,847 --> 00:52:17,905
Come.

866
00:52:17,981 --> 00:52:19,073
Sunny.

867
00:52:19,416 --> 00:52:22,943
Sunny, what's going on?

868
00:52:23,020 --> 00:52:24,954
Hey Sunny, cheers.

869
00:52:25,022 --> 00:52:27,650
Hey Neel, how are you?
- How is it going?

870
00:52:27,724 --> 00:52:28,782
Hi.

871
00:52:28,859 --> 00:52:30,417
What's up?
- Hi.

872
00:52:31,428 --> 00:52:32,554
What are these flowers and all for?

873
00:52:33,964 --> 00:52:35,693
Yes, I already proposed to her.

874
00:52:35,766 --> 00:52:36,824
No you didn't.

875
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:39,960
We started to run for a marathon.
- What?

876
00:52:40,370 --> 00:52:41,428
Okay, okay.

877
00:52:41,505 --> 00:52:43,871
I want to say to you in
front of all my friends.

878
00:52:43,941 --> 00:52:46,432
Tina, will you marry me?

879
00:52:46,510 --> 00:52:47,909
Come on, come on.

880
00:52:47,978 --> 00:52:49,036
Yes.

881
00:52:52,049 --> 00:52:53,107
I love you.

882
00:52:53,450 --> 00:52:54,815
Three cheers for Sunny.

883
00:52:56,887 --> 00:52:57,945
Why is he running?

884
00:52:58,021 --> 00:52:59,511
He is always running.

885
00:52:59,590 --> 00:53:00,648
What?

886
00:53:01,725 --> 00:53:03,596
Crazy guy, running away
from beautiful girls.

887
00:53:03,597 --> 00:53:04,125
I don't know.

888
00:53:11,602 --> 00:53:12,660
Sunny!

889
00:53:17,941 --> 00:53:19,670
Sunny, where are you?

890
00:53:25,749 --> 00:53:26,807
Sunny.

891
00:53:27,484 --> 00:53:28,974
Hey Sweetie, have a seat.

892
00:53:29,052 --> 00:53:30,110
Thanks.

893
00:53:35,492 --> 00:53:36,550
Good.

894
00:53:38,929 --> 00:53:39,987
Same here.

895
00:53:40,063 --> 00:53:41,121
So how's your day been going?

896
00:53:41,198 --> 00:53:42,426
You are looking really good.

897
00:53:46,937 --> 00:53:48,495
Something is weird.

898
00:53:48,572 --> 00:53:49,766
There is something weird.

899
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:50,898
What are you doing?

900
00:53:50,974 --> 00:53:52,168
What are you doing?

901
00:53:52,509 --> 00:53:53,567
Stop it.

902
00:53:54,511 --> 00:53:55,569
What's going on?

903
00:53:55,646 --> 00:53:57,170
What is that?

904
00:54:00,784 --> 00:54:01,842
What are you doing?

905
00:54:01,919 --> 00:54:02,977
Look, what is there.

906
00:54:03,053 --> 00:54:04,111
What are you doing?

907
00:54:04,187 --> 00:54:05,518
That's my helmet.

908
00:54:05,589 --> 00:54:06,647
That's my helmet.

909
00:54:06,990 --> 00:54:08,719
Stop the guy, stop.

910
00:54:08,792 --> 00:54:10,657
That's my helmet, you idiot.

911
00:54:15,032 --> 00:54:16,192
Stop, where are you going?

912
00:54:16,533 --> 00:54:17,864
He dropped my helmet.

913
00:54:18,802 --> 00:54:20,030
You rogue.

914
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:22,070
You rogue, get down here I will...

915
00:54:24,074 --> 00:54:25,541
Stop, stop that. What are you doing?

916
00:54:34,084 --> 00:54:35,210
Stop.

917
00:54:39,823 --> 00:54:40,881
Stop!

918
00:54:41,992 --> 00:54:43,050
Stop!

919
00:54:46,563 --> 00:54:47,689
Drive slowly!

920
00:55:04,848 --> 00:55:07,646
I am saved, better late than never.

921
00:55:07,718 --> 00:55:08,776
Thanks a lot.

922
00:55:08,852 --> 00:55:10,843
No, no don't thank me.

923
00:55:10,921 --> 00:55:13,253
Uncle Jordan himself asked me
that he wants to see you.

924
00:55:13,523 --> 00:55:15,514
So Neel...

925
00:55:15,592 --> 00:55:17,526
...I heard from the head of
the Columbia university...

926
00:55:17,594 --> 00:55:19,585
...who happens to be a very
good friend of mine.

927
00:55:19,663 --> 00:55:20,960
You are quite a student.

928
00:55:21,031 --> 00:55:22,089
I am just a...

929
00:55:22,165 --> 00:55:23,530
But I am a venture capitalist...

930
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:26,592
...and a very successful one at that.

931
00:55:26,670 --> 00:55:29,605
I spent a couple of
weeks over in India.

932
00:55:29,673 --> 00:55:32,267
With some really high
profile people.

933
00:55:32,876 --> 00:55:34,867
It's a hot bed for investment.

934
00:55:34,945 --> 00:55:37,004
Yes, I would agree to that.

935
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:39,548
Exactly, so I would like to
know if you are interested...

936
00:55:39,616 --> 00:55:42,278
...in starting what I want.

937
00:55:42,352 --> 00:55:47,187
The next international wave
of business investment.

938
00:55:47,257 --> 00:55:48,884
A call centre.

939
00:55:52,629 --> 00:55:54,620
This is the India project.

940
00:56:00,170 --> 00:56:02,161
Wow, India project.

941
00:56:05,142 --> 00:56:06,939
What did you want to say?
- Say it.

942
00:56:07,010 --> 00:56:08,068
What happened?
- Neel, listen.

943
00:56:08,145 --> 00:56:09,578
No intelligent man will
take such a risky step...

944
00:56:09,646 --> 00:56:12,012
...like you are going to do.

945
00:56:12,082 --> 00:56:13,982
Why? What happened?
I didn't understand.

946
00:56:14,051 --> 00:56:17,248
Neel, you have received a job
offer of 2 lakh dollars.

947
00:56:17,654 --> 00:56:18,848
I was so happy.

948
00:56:18,922 --> 00:56:22,221
And when I told my dad about
it, he was so happy.

949
00:56:22,659 --> 00:56:24,593
The negative thought that
he had about you...

950
00:56:24,661 --> 00:56:26,151
...I saw it turning positive.

951
00:56:26,229 --> 00:56:27,594
When he will come to know
that you have denied...

952
00:56:27,664 --> 00:56:29,598
...such a nice job offer
and are going to India...

953
00:56:29,666 --> 00:56:31,657
...then what will he think?

954
00:56:33,804 --> 00:56:36,102
He will think negatively
about me again!

955
00:56:36,173 --> 00:56:37,231
Neel.

956
00:56:40,077 --> 00:56:42,602
Look Maya, the company that
has given me this offer...

957
00:56:42,679 --> 00:56:44,670
...knows what my worth is.

958
00:56:46,116 --> 00:56:48,676
And I think this is
a good opportunity.

959
00:56:48,952 --> 00:56:50,681
I don't want to let go of it.

960
00:56:51,688 --> 00:56:53,155
Neel, I know you are brilliant.

961
00:56:53,223 --> 00:56:54,952
But business is a gamble.

962
00:56:55,025 --> 00:56:57,118
You can have success and
be unsuccessful too.

963
00:56:57,194 --> 00:56:58,627
If every person starts
thinking this way...

964
00:56:58,695 --> 00:57:00,128
...then who will do business.

965
00:57:00,197 --> 00:57:02,290
You can do a business here too.

966
00:57:02,365 --> 00:57:04,230
But I have received an
offer for India, Maya.

967
00:57:04,301 --> 00:57:05,700
What are you saying?

968
00:57:06,703 --> 00:57:08,295
I don't want to miss
this opportunity.

969
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:11,901
Yes, you are right.

970
00:57:13,310 --> 00:57:14,709
Even if you have to miss me.

971
00:57:14,978 --> 00:57:16,036
Maya!

972
00:57:16,113 --> 00:57:17,307
Neel, you don't understand.

973
00:57:17,714 --> 00:57:19,272
Dad will never send me to India.

974
00:57:19,716 --> 00:57:21,843
I am not going to India
to get settled there.

975
00:57:22,285 --> 00:57:24,310
I am going to India to
setup a call centre.

976
00:57:24,387 --> 00:57:25,649
I can come back here...

977
00:57:25,722 --> 00:57:27,280
...and manage my business
from here too.

978
00:57:30,994 --> 00:57:32,655
And right now I need
your support Maya...

979
00:57:32,729 --> 00:57:33,787
...and not your lecture.

980
00:57:35,665 --> 00:57:36,791
Neel.

981
00:57:41,104 --> 00:57:42,162
I support you.

982
00:57:44,741 --> 00:57:46,402
But I will really miss you Neel.

983
00:57:49,012 --> 00:57:50,070
I will miss you too.

984
00:57:51,748 --> 00:57:52,806
I love you

985
00:57:54,050 --> 00:57:55,108
Come in, Jordan.

986
00:57:55,185 --> 00:57:56,743
Hello Neel, come on in.

987
00:57:58,221 --> 00:57:59,313
How are you doing today?

988
00:57:59,756 --> 00:58:03,692
I, have transferred 10
million US dollars...

989
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:05,751
...into a bank account in India.

990
00:58:06,229 --> 00:58:08,754
What. This is the bank information.

991
00:58:13,303 --> 00:58:14,361
Wow.

992
00:58:15,338 --> 00:58:19,775
And these are first class tickets
for you and your team.

993
00:58:22,712 --> 00:58:22,925
Great.

994
00:58:22,926 --> 00:58:24,236
Good luck Neel.
- Thank you so much.

995
00:58:24,314 --> 00:58:25,781
Thank you. Thank you.

996
00:58:27,217 --> 00:58:29,708
We will rock you.

997
00:58:31,054 --> 00:58:33,352
We will shock you.

998
00:58:34,324 --> 00:58:37,452
We will rock you.

999
00:58:54,344 --> 00:58:55,971
Meet the county guys!

1000
00:58:56,079 --> 00:58:57,740
We go to the things that rock!

1001
00:58:59,015 --> 00:59:01,415
What are you going to do,
where are you going to go.

1002
00:59:16,266 --> 00:59:17,824
We will rock you.

1003
00:59:18,368 --> 00:59:19,460
We will rock you.

1004
00:59:19,836 --> 00:59:21,201
We will shock you.

1005
00:59:22,105 --> 00:59:23,163
We will shock you.

1006
00:59:23,373 --> 00:59:24,931
We will rock you.

1007
00:59:25,342 --> 00:59:26,832
We will shock you.

1008
00:59:28,111 --> 00:59:30,841
This is our world.

1009
00:59:31,848 --> 00:59:34,442
This is where we live.

1010
00:59:35,385 --> 00:59:42,518
In our happiness, we
forget out sorrows.

1011
00:59:43,126 --> 00:59:47,859
We are different then everyone.

1012
00:59:51,201 --> 00:59:54,932
It's our world. It's our world.
It's our world. It's our world.

1013
00:59:55,005 --> 00:59:58,873
It's our world. It's our world.
It's our world. It's our world.

1014
00:59:58,942 --> 01:00:00,000
We will rock you.

1015
01:00:00,343 --> 01:00:01,810
We will shock you.

1016
01:00:02,145 --> 01:00:03,874
We will rock you.

1017
01:00:04,147 --> 01:00:05,546
We will shock you.

1018
01:00:31,441 --> 01:00:34,842
There is zest and obsession
filled in us.

1019
01:00:35,178 --> 01:00:38,841
We live in our dream world.

1020
01:00:38,915 --> 01:00:41,907
Sometimes we think, sometimes
we understand.

1021
01:00:42,452 --> 01:00:46,183
Let's have some fun.

1022
01:00:46,256 --> 01:00:51,922
It's the ambiance of merriment.

1023
01:00:52,929 --> 01:00:55,295
It's the intoxication of love.

1024
01:00:56,399 --> 01:01:00,028
We always listen to our heart.

1025
01:01:01,204 --> 01:01:04,867
It's our world. It's our world.
It's our world. It's our world.

1026
01:01:04,941 --> 01:01:08,604
It's our world. It's our world.
It's our world. It's our world.

1027
01:01:08,678 --> 01:01:09,940
We will rock you.

1028
01:01:10,213 --> 01:01:12,010
We will shock you.

1029
01:01:12,215 --> 01:01:13,614
We will rock you.

1030
01:01:14,150 --> 01:01:15,617
We will shock you.

1031
01:01:45,482 --> 01:01:48,246
What is right, what is wrong...

1032
01:01:48,985 --> 01:01:52,216
We know that very well.

1033
01:01:52,489 --> 01:01:55,652
Whoever calls us naive?

1034
01:01:56,259 --> 01:01:59,660
He is naive himself.

1035
01:02:00,196 --> 01:02:05,657
We are crazy; we can
make the sky kneel.

1036
01:02:06,469 --> 01:02:15,002
Stop the storm, if we
make up our minds.

1037
01:02:15,078 --> 01:02:18,639
It's our world. It's our world.
It's our world. It's our world.

1038
01:02:18,715 --> 01:02:22,549
It's our world. It's our world.
It's our world. It's our world.

1039
01:02:22,619 --> 01:02:24,018
We will rock you.

1040
01:02:24,287 --> 01:02:25,686
We will shock you.

1041
01:02:26,156 --> 01:02:27,623
We will rock you.

1042
01:02:28,024 --> 01:02:29,457
We will shock you.

1043
01:02:32,262 --> 01:02:33,695
I like it, wow.

1044
01:02:34,564 --> 01:02:36,031
Rajesh, you are great.

1045
01:02:36,299 --> 01:02:37,357
This is Tanvi.

1046
01:02:37,434 --> 01:02:38,492
Wow.

1047
01:02:38,568 --> 01:02:41,560
Sister-in-law is really great.

1048
01:02:42,038 --> 01:02:43,699
This is not sister-in-law,
she is not my wife.

1049
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:45,371
Then is she a model?

1050
01:02:46,176 --> 01:02:47,438
She is posing like a model.

1051
01:02:47,510 --> 01:02:48,568
Keep quiet.

1052
01:02:48,645 --> 01:02:49,703
She can work in films too.

1053
01:02:49,779 --> 01:02:51,713
You can say that she is my partner.

1054
01:02:51,981 --> 01:02:53,039
Partner.

1055
01:02:53,116 --> 01:02:55,050
I search for clients here in US. Ok

1056
01:02:55,118 --> 01:02:57,609
And she looks after my BPO in India.

1057
01:02:57,687 --> 01:02:59,052
She will help you in every way.

1058
01:02:59,322 --> 01:03:00,380
That's great.

1059
01:03:01,191 --> 01:03:02,488
Then our work has become easier.

1060
01:03:02,559 --> 01:03:06,051
When the girl is beautiful,
everything becomes easier.

1061
01:03:06,129 --> 01:03:07,187
Keep quiet.

1062
01:03:07,530 --> 01:03:10,328
She makes everything possible.

1063
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:13,062
She is the most successful
call centre manager.

1064
01:03:13,136 --> 01:03:14,660
And a lovely person to work with.

1065
01:03:15,338 --> 01:03:16,396
Do you have all your paperwork...

1066
01:03:16,473 --> 01:03:17,599
...and money in order?

1067
01:03:18,007 --> 01:03:19,065
Yes, everything.

1068
01:03:19,509 --> 01:03:21,170
Great. I will see you in India.

1069
01:03:21,544 --> 01:03:22,602
I didn't understand.

1070
01:03:23,079 --> 01:03:24,137
You are coming to India too.

1071
01:03:24,214 --> 01:03:26,444
Of course, I am going to India
by tomorrow's flight.

1072
01:03:26,516 --> 01:03:27,174
Wow, that's great.

1073
01:03:27,175 --> 01:03:28,381
Great.
- Then let's go together.

1074
01:03:28,451 --> 01:03:29,509
Thank you, sir.

1075
01:03:29,586 --> 01:03:30,644
Nice talking to you sir.

1076
01:03:31,621 --> 01:03:34,522
But your selection is very nice.
- Thank you so much.

1077
01:03:35,692 --> 01:03:40,561
I see, so you met this
lady Tanvi in India.

1078
01:03:40,630 --> 01:03:42,029
Yes officer. And I am sure
she is in America...

1079
01:03:42,098 --> 01:03:44,032
...because her partner Rajesh,
who introduced me to her...

1080
01:03:44,100 --> 01:03:47,035
...had also come to America.

1081
01:03:49,038 --> 01:03:50,096
Send the girl.

1082
01:04:20,737 --> 01:04:23,433
I am telling you the truth officer,
this is the woman!

1083
01:04:23,573 --> 01:04:25,131
She is responsible for everything.

1084
01:04:25,208 --> 01:04:26,675
Officer, she is the
one that framed me.

1085
01:04:26,743 --> 01:04:28,404
I am not going to leave her!
- I am going to kill her!

1086
01:04:28,478 --> 01:04:30,001
Control yourself, Mr. Neel.

1087
01:04:30,002 --> 01:04:31,072
Neel!
- Cool down.

1088
01:04:32,515 --> 01:04:34,073
Ms. Tanvi, is it true.,

1089
01:04:34,150 --> 01:04:35,447
...that you have framed Mr. Neel?

1090
01:04:36,152 --> 01:04:40,816
I tried, but he was already
in love with Maya.

1091
01:04:43,660 --> 01:04:44,752
Answer the question.

1092
01:04:44,827 --> 01:04:46,454
No, I have not framed him.

1093
01:04:47,163 --> 01:04:48,221
He is lying.

1094
01:04:48,298 --> 01:04:49,822
I am not lying, officer,
she is the one lying.

1095
01:04:49,899 --> 01:04:52,265
Mr. Neel, please be quiet. Please.

1096
01:04:54,170 --> 01:04:56,104
So madam, do you mean to say...

1097
01:04:56,172 --> 01:04:58,367
...that you have not
committed the fraud.

1098
01:04:58,441 --> 01:05:00,705
No, a thousand times no!

1099
01:05:00,777 --> 01:05:04,713
Ms. Tanvi, we have many
ways to find the truth.

1100
01:05:05,682 --> 01:05:08,116
Because you have committed
the fraud...

1101
01:05:08,184 --> 01:05:10,618
...it's better for you that
you accept your crime.

1102
01:05:11,721 --> 01:05:13,120
If he would have listened to me...

1103
01:05:13,189 --> 01:05:15,248
...then I wouldn't have done
anything like this.

1104
01:05:15,325 --> 01:05:16,849
And this wouldn't have
happened with him.

1105
01:05:17,460 --> 01:05:20,122
Tanvi Kapoor can tolerate
everything...

1106
01:05:20,196 --> 01:05:22,824
...but not her insult.

1107
01:05:23,466 --> 01:05:25,457
And that's why I had to do all this.

1108
01:05:31,474 --> 01:05:33,567
Gentlemen, this is Tanvi.

1109
01:05:46,155 --> 01:05:48,487
Oh baby! Yes!

1110
01:05:49,492 --> 01:05:51,221
Hi.
- Tanvi, this is Neel.

1111
01:05:51,294 --> 01:05:52,625
Hello.
- Hi!

1112
01:05:53,696 --> 01:05:57,154
'Till today, boys would
be mesmerised seeing me.'

1113
01:05:58,368 --> 01:06:00,632
'But today he has floored me.'

1114
01:06:02,238 --> 01:06:03,296
This is Sunny.

1115
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:05,366
Hello.
- Hi.

1116
01:06:06,242 --> 01:06:08,904
Enough! Enough! Enough!

1117
01:06:10,513 --> 01:06:12,538
Tanvi...
- Such a long time for shaking hands.

1118
01:06:12,615 --> 01:06:14,810
Such a long time to embrace.

1119
01:06:14,884 --> 01:06:16,511
This is not fair, man.

1120
01:06:17,387 --> 01:06:20,254
Tanvi, this is Soy Chi.
- Hi.

1121
01:06:20,323 --> 01:06:21,688
This is a 2007 machine.

1122
01:06:22,525 --> 01:06:23,583
And this is Pat.

1123
01:06:23,793 --> 01:06:23,944
Hi.

1124
01:06:23,945 --> 01:06:25,658
Hello.
- He is completely stupid.

1125
01:06:26,796 --> 01:06:27,854
I am joking.

1126
01:06:27,930 --> 01:06:30,262
I have arranged for all
of you to stay here.

1127
01:06:30,333 --> 01:06:32,198
All of you rest now, tomorrow...

1128
01:06:32,268 --> 01:06:34,498
...we will go to the
call centre together.

1129
01:06:36,806 --> 01:06:38,273
Okay, I will see you.

1130
01:06:38,541 --> 01:06:39,633
Okay, see you.
- Bye.

1131
01:06:43,746 --> 01:06:44,804
Bye. Ok

1132
01:06:49,552 --> 01:06:50,610
Good.

1133
01:06:51,220 --> 01:06:52,278
Look at this.

1134
01:06:54,724 --> 01:06:55,782
Very nice

1135
01:06:55,858 --> 01:06:58,224
The money that Mr. Jordan had sent...

1136
01:06:58,294 --> 01:07:00,728
...I have used it so well; you
can see it for yourself.

1137
01:07:00,797 --> 01:07:02,230
Yes, I can see that.
- Thank you.

1138
01:07:02,298 --> 01:07:03,356
Amazing.
- Thank you.

1139
01:07:03,433 --> 01:07:05,765
Wow. Jordan, I feel proud of you.

1140
01:07:06,436 --> 01:07:07,494
Thank you.

1141
01:07:07,570 --> 01:07:09,231
You have set up everything so well...

1142
01:07:09,305 --> 01:07:11,296
...that we can start
our work right now.

1143
01:07:12,308 --> 01:07:15,243
And yes, I have readied
the database...

1144
01:07:15,311 --> 01:07:17,575
...of the clients of US, Europe
and the Middle-East.

1145
01:07:17,647 --> 01:07:19,239
wow Very good.

1146
01:07:21,584 --> 01:07:24,610
Neel, come I will show
you your office.

1147
01:07:24,687 --> 01:07:26,678
And we have to do some important
discussion too.

1148
01:07:26,756 --> 01:07:27,814
Okay.

1149
01:07:28,791 --> 01:07:30,258
How many cabins are there?

1150
01:07:30,326 --> 01:07:31,793
Yes, this is your cabin.

1151
01:07:31,861 --> 01:07:32,987
Very nice, dude.

1152
01:07:34,797 --> 01:07:37,766
Fantastic! Fantastic, dude!

1153
01:07:37,834 --> 01:07:39,597
I have made all the arrangements.

1154
01:07:39,669 --> 01:07:41,762
You can start taking the
interviews from today.

1155
01:07:43,339 --> 01:07:44,704
Thank you very much, Tanvi.

1156
01:07:44,774 --> 01:07:45,934
No thanks.

1157
01:07:46,008 --> 01:07:47,873
I have done all this just for you.

1158
01:07:47,944 --> 01:07:50,003
Only for you.

1159
01:07:56,619 --> 01:07:57,677
Why this?

1160
01:07:57,754 --> 01:08:01,588
Whomever I like, I capture him.

1161
01:08:03,292 --> 01:08:04,350
You didn't understand?

1162
01:08:04,627 --> 01:08:05,787
You will.

1163
01:08:05,928 --> 01:08:06,986
Bye.

1164
01:08:14,937 --> 01:08:15,995
Please come again.

1165
01:08:16,372 --> 01:08:17,464
I want to see everything.

1166
01:08:17,540 --> 01:08:19,701
Okay guys.
- Nice.

1167
01:08:19,842 --> 01:08:20,900
Let's get on with it.

1168
01:08:21,644 --> 01:08:22,906
We will have to start the
interviews today itself.

1169
01:08:22,979 --> 01:08:24,378
Today.
- Yes.

1170
01:08:26,649 --> 01:08:27,707
Next.

1171
01:08:28,651 --> 01:08:29,709
You are hired.

1172
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:32,012
Yes, you are hired.

1173
01:08:32,655 --> 01:08:33,917

Good afternoon, Mr. Kingston.

01:08:40,563 --> 01:08:42,053

Yes You are hired.

1179
01:08:58,347 --> 01:08:59,405
Sunny!
- Yes.

1180
01:08:59,849 --> 01:09:01,077
I am going to the loo, sit here.

1181
01:09:01,484 --> 01:09:03,611
Okay, take care.

1182
01:09:13,095 --> 01:09:14,357
Hello sir.

1183
01:09:16,933 --> 01:09:18,366
Hello.

1184
01:09:21,370 --> 01:09:23,361
Sit please.
- Thank you.

1185
01:09:28,878 --> 01:09:30,812
So...
- So!

1186
01:09:32,114 --> 01:09:34,548
So.
- You called me.

1187
01:09:35,751 --> 01:09:36,809
I called you!

1188
01:09:36,986 --> 01:09:38,044
Yes, the bell.

1189
01:09:38,554 --> 01:09:42,820
Oh, so you have come hearing the bell.
- Yes.

1190
01:09:43,459 --> 01:09:45,689
Then I will take this
bell to the bedroom.

1191
01:09:47,063 --> 01:09:48,121
Should we start?

1192
01:09:48,397 --> 01:09:49,455
What, fun?

1193
01:09:49,532 --> 01:09:51,056
No, interview.

1194
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:52,458
Very smart.

1195
01:09:53,436 --> 01:09:54,630
You are very smart.

1196
01:09:55,404 --> 01:09:56,462
You are selected.

1197
01:09:57,139 --> 01:09:58,697
Come on, come on.

1198
01:09:59,909 --> 01:10:00,967
You are selected.

1199
01:10:01,644 --> 01:10:04,135
Hey Soy, what's up?

1200
01:10:04,413 --> 01:10:05,471
Hey Neel...

1201
01:10:05,548 --> 01:10:07,880
Tanvi has been calling you
for the past 2 hours...

1202
01:10:07,950 --> 01:10:09,076
...because your phone was off range.

1203
01:10:09,719 --> 01:10:10,777
What did she say?

1204
01:10:10,953 --> 01:10:13,615
She said she has some urgent
matter to discuss with you.

1205
01:10:13,956 --> 01:10:16,424
She wants you to go over
to her place tonight.

1206
01:10:16,859 --> 01:10:17,917
Right away.

1207
01:10:18,828 --> 01:10:20,159
Okay. I will go see her.
- Okay.

1208
01:10:26,168 --> 01:10:27,430
Tanvi.

1209
01:11:18,821 --> 01:11:23,918
I am there.

1210
01:11:26,662 --> 01:11:31,759
You are there.

1211
01:11:34,236 --> 01:11:41,506
It's a moonlit night.

1212
01:11:43,045 --> 01:11:46,037
What can I do?

1213
01:11:46,916 --> 01:11:50,249
What can I do?

1214
01:11:50,886 --> 01:11:55,220
What can I do?

1215
01:11:56,525 --> 01:11:59,926
Do you need to think about that?

1216
01:12:00,329 --> 01:12:03,628
Do you need to think about that?

1217
01:12:03,833 --> 01:12:08,793
I am there.

1218
01:12:11,574 --> 01:12:16,671
You are there.

1219
01:12:54,316 --> 01:12:59,845
Come, come, come in my arms.

1220
01:13:01,957 --> 01:13:08,590
Don't make my heart restless.

1221
01:13:10,599 --> 01:13:12,590
There is a bit of fun.

1222
01:13:12,668 --> 01:13:14,329
And a bit of eagerness.

1223
01:13:14,403 --> 01:13:17,770
The ambiance is crazy.

1224
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:20,206
My tresses are swaying.

1225
01:13:20,342 --> 01:13:22,139
My desires are out of control.

1226
01:13:22,344 --> 01:13:26,212
We both are young.

1227
01:13:26,615 --> 01:13:29,607
What can I do?

1228
01:13:30,352 --> 01:13:33,685
What can I do?

1229
01:13:34,290 --> 01:13:38,659
What can I do?

1230
01:13:39,862 --> 01:13:43,628
Do you need to think about that?

1231
01:13:43,733 --> 01:13:47,066
Do you need to think about that?

1232
01:14:32,281 --> 01:14:38,686
There are smolders and passion
between the breaths.

1233
01:14:40,156 --> 01:14:46,686
Now I can't endure the warm sighs.

1234
01:14:48,497 --> 01:14:50,431
It's a beautiful ambiance.

1235
01:14:50,499 --> 01:14:52,364
A wonderful mood.

1236
01:14:52,434 --> 01:14:55,699
Love is scattered everywhere.

1237
01:14:55,771 --> 01:14:58,171
My heart is crazy for you.

1238
01:14:58,307 --> 01:15:00,241
My troubled heartbeat says.

1239
01:15:00,309 --> 01:15:03,972
I cannot tolerate the distance
anymore, darling.

1240
01:15:04,446 --> 01:15:07,711
What can I do?

1241
01:15:08,350 --> 01:15:11,717
What can I do?

1242
01:15:12,354 --> 01:15:16,723
What can I do?

1243
01:15:17,726 --> 01:15:21,389
Do you need to think about that?

1244
01:15:21,730 --> 01:15:24,961
Do you need to think about that?

1245
01:15:28,304 --> 01:15:29,362
Hi Maya.

1246
01:15:29,805 --> 01:15:32,399
Hi babes, I love you.
- I love you too.

1247
01:15:33,409 --> 01:15:36,469
I was missing you a lot today.

1248
01:15:36,812 --> 01:15:40,077
I was thinking you must have
found another girl there.

1249
01:15:42,084 --> 01:15:43,813
Sweetheart, this is an Indian heart.

1250
01:15:44,353 --> 01:15:46,480
It lives one time and dies one time.

1251
01:15:48,324 --> 01:15:50,053
And only you reside in my heart.

1252
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:52,486
Never forget that.

1253
01:15:53,429 --> 01:15:54,828
Yes, I will call you back.
- I will call you back.

1254
01:15:55,364 --> 01:15:58,094
Okay Neel, take care, bye.

1255
01:15:58,167 --> 01:15:59,395
You too, bye.

1256
01:16:07,309 --> 01:16:09,368
Eat, eat like gluttons.

1257
01:16:09,845 --> 01:16:11,403
How much are you eating?

1258
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:13,380
I am not eating, they are eating.

1259
01:16:13,449 --> 01:16:15,349
The both of them.
- The food is tasty.

1260
01:16:15,851 --> 01:16:17,785
Eat carefully, take care
of your stomach...

1261
01:16:17,853 --> 01:16:20,117
...usually foreigners cannot
digest Indian food.

1262
01:16:20,189 --> 01:16:21,247
What?

1263
01:16:21,323 --> 01:16:22,415
Come on, hurry up.
- Spicy man.

1264
01:16:22,858 --> 01:16:24,849
You will only fart like animals.

1265
01:16:24,927 --> 01:16:26,121
You don't believe it.

1266
01:16:26,195 --> 01:16:27,856
Then eat, eat this too.

1267
01:16:27,930 --> 01:16:29,397
Don't do that, he will die.

1268
01:16:29,865 --> 01:16:32,060
eat Guys, guys, take it easy.

1269
01:16:32,868 --> 01:16:34,096
Come on guys, hurry up.

1270
01:16:39,141 --> 01:16:40,199
Careful dear.

1271
01:16:42,077 --> 01:16:43,374
Come brother.

1272
01:16:44,346 --> 01:16:46,211
I am elder to you.

1273
01:16:46,282 --> 01:16:48,341
Elder brother.

1274
01:16:48,884 --> 01:16:51,546
Why did you bring me here
from the airport?

1275
01:16:52,388 --> 01:16:53,821
After reaching Pune, I
would have eaten food...

1276
01:16:54,823 --> 01:16:56,256
...cooked by sister-in-law.
- Keep quiet.

1277
01:16:56,325 --> 01:16:57,815
You are coming directly
from America.

1278
01:16:57,893 --> 01:17:01,954
After travelling for 20 hours,
you must be hungry.

1279
01:17:02,031 --> 01:17:03,555
But why did you come alone?

1280
01:17:03,899 --> 01:17:06,561
Why didn't you bring that
useless Sunny along?

1281
01:17:07,303 --> 01:17:10,329
Brother, I couldn't
get through to him.

1282
01:17:10,906 --> 01:17:13,568
And when I went to his house,
it was locked.

1283
01:17:13,909 --> 01:17:16,844
I was thinking, if you would
have brought Sunny along...

1284
01:17:16,912 --> 01:17:19,847
...then I would have beaten him...

1285
01:17:19,915 --> 01:17:22,440
...all the way from Mumbai to Pune.

1286
01:17:22,518 --> 01:17:24,179
Their appetite is different.

1287
01:17:28,190 --> 01:17:29,248
What has happened to him?

1288
01:17:29,925 --> 01:17:31,415
Pat! Pat!
- Pat, are you okay?

1289
01:17:33,862 --> 01:17:34,920
What happened?

1290
01:17:34,997 --> 01:17:36,191
What happened, Pat?

1291
01:17:36,265 --> 01:17:37,323
My stomach's paining.

1292
01:17:37,933 --> 01:17:39,924
I had told you. But
you didn't listen.

1293
01:17:40,002 --> 01:17:42,129
You were eating like
an animal, dude.

1294
01:17:42,204 --> 01:17:43,398
I will take him.

1295
01:17:43,472 --> 01:17:44,530
What?

1296
01:17:44,940 --> 01:17:48,205
I will take him to the doctor.
C'mon Pat. C'mon. Let's go.

1297
01:17:48,277 --> 01:17:49,869
Just see, if the stomach
gets cured...

1298
01:17:49,945 --> 01:17:52,470
...otherwise operate on him
and take the food out.

1299
01:17:54,216 --> 01:17:54,853
Waiter.

1300
01:17:54,854 --> 01:17:56,946
Yes sir.
- What yes...

1301
01:18:05,494 --> 01:18:06,620
I am dead.

1302
01:18:06,962 --> 01:18:08,395
America India together.

1303
01:18:10,466 --> 01:18:14,960
Sunny, if you are caught they
will thrash you like Osama.

1304
01:18:18,507 --> 01:18:20,270
Waiter.
- Yes sir.

1305
01:18:20,342 --> 01:18:21,502
Come here.
- Come here.

1306
01:18:21,577 --> 01:18:23,238
Will you change clothes with me?

1307
01:18:23,979 --> 01:18:25,446
Will you change clothes with me?

1308
01:18:25,514 --> 01:18:26,640
I didn't understand.

1309
01:18:26,715 --> 01:18:29,479
You wear my goggles, and
I will wear your turban.

1310
01:18:29,985 --> 01:18:31,111
And when we pay the bill, then
you can have your turban...

1311
01:18:31,186 --> 01:18:32,585
...and return me my goggles.

1312
01:18:32,988 --> 01:18:34,250
Go.

1313
01:18:35,257 --> 01:18:36,315
Waiter.

1314
01:18:37,993 --> 01:18:39,517
Waiter.

1315
01:18:41,263 --> 01:18:42,389
Waiter.

1316
01:18:42,464 --> 01:18:44,625
You won't die if you don't
eat for a little while.

1317
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,126
Can't you hear?

1318
01:18:50,472 --> 01:18:51,530
Yes.

1319
01:18:51,607 --> 01:18:53,438
Why have you hidden your face?

1320
01:18:55,277 --> 01:19:00,613
Will you place the order seeing
my face? Tell me what will you eat?

1321
01:19:01,283 --> 01:19:02,443
He is very manner-less.

1322
01:19:03,152 --> 01:19:04,414
Manner-less.

1323
01:19:06,522 --> 01:19:07,955
Manner-less people like you...

1324
01:19:08,023 --> 01:19:10,116
...will have manner-less children.

1325
01:19:11,293 --> 01:19:12,419
What will you have?

1326
01:19:12,494 --> 01:19:13,620
Pen please.

1327
01:19:15,964 --> 01:19:17,022
Tell me.

1328
01:19:17,099 --> 01:19:18,532
I don't think you are a waiter.

1329
01:19:19,034 --> 01:19:22,026
I have to become a waiter
for people like you.

1330
01:19:22,104 --> 01:19:23,162
Tell me, what you will have.

1331
01:19:23,238 --> 01:19:24,296
One butter chicken.

1332
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:26,564
And 4 baked bread.

1333
01:19:27,042 --> 01:19:28,509
And bring it quickly.
- Go.

1334
01:19:28,577 --> 01:19:31,569
Is that a dish too?
- Hurry up?

1335
01:19:35,050 --> 01:19:36,711
Oh, it was those lousy goat balls.

1336
01:19:39,321 --> 01:19:40,720
Feeling a lot better though.

1337
01:19:42,991 --> 01:19:44,049
I am glad.

1338
01:19:45,561 --> 01:19:47,722
Hello.
- Hi sweetheart.

1339
01:19:48,330 --> 01:19:50,298
I miss you so much. I miss you to.

1340
01:19:50,365 --> 01:19:52,333
Tell me, are you speaking
from the call centre?

1341
01:19:52,401 --> 01:19:53,459
No, from the hospital.

1342
01:19:53,535 --> 01:19:54,729
Hospital!

1343
01:19:55,070 --> 01:19:56,298
What has happened to you Neel?

1344
01:19:56,371 --> 01:19:58,339
Nothing, Pat's stomach was upset.

1345
01:19:58,407 --> 01:19:59,999
He had eaten goat-balls.

1346
01:20:00,342 --> 01:20:02,242
How is he feeling now?

1347
01:20:02,311 --> 01:20:04,074
He is better, he just needs to rest.

1348
01:20:07,015 --> 01:20:08,607
Neel, papa.
- I will call you back.

1349
01:20:08,684 --> 01:20:10,083
Okay, okay.

1350
01:20:11,687 --> 01:20:13,279
Whom were you talking to, dear?

1351
01:20:14,690 --> 01:20:16,180
With Neel.

1352
01:20:17,559 --> 01:20:18,753
Something wrong, papa?

1353
01:20:19,628 --> 01:20:24,497
Dear, its better that you don't
have any relation with Neel.

1354
01:20:24,566 --> 01:20:25,624
Papa.

1355
01:20:26,101 --> 01:20:27,500
What are you saying?

1356
01:20:27,569 --> 01:20:30,197
The same thing I explained
to Neel with my experience.

1357
01:20:30,272 --> 01:20:31,762
And now I am explaining to you too.

1358
01:20:32,107 --> 01:20:34,041
Neel is not worthy of you.

1359
01:20:34,376 --> 01:20:36,640
Papa, how can you say
that about Neel?

1360
01:20:37,112 --> 01:20:39,706
Then why did he go to
India from America.

1361
01:20:39,781 --> 01:20:42,773
For business.
- No, for the greed of money.

1362
01:20:43,619 --> 01:20:46,611
Because he was getting more
money there than here.

1363
01:20:47,122 --> 01:20:49,113
Papa, Neel is not such a boy.

1364
01:20:49,191 --> 01:20:50,453
He is a nice guy.

1365
01:20:50,526 --> 01:20:53,051
Look dear, I don't
want to argue on...

1366
01:20:53,128 --> 01:20:55,528
...whether Neel is a nice boy or not.

1367
01:20:55,664 --> 01:20:58,064
I have come to tell you that...

1368
01:20:58,133 --> 01:21:00,465
...I have found a Catholic
boy for you.

1369
01:21:00,536 --> 01:21:03,664
Papa, you know that
I love Neel a lot.

1370
01:21:03,739 --> 01:21:05,070
I am sure that after marriage...

1371
01:21:05,140 --> 01:21:07,404
...you will love your
husband the same way.

1372
01:21:07,476 --> 01:21:10,809
Look. This is his photo.

1373
01:21:11,146 --> 01:21:13,080
His father runs one of the biggest...

1374
01:21:13,148 --> 01:21:14,445
...ship building company in USA.

1375
01:21:14,516 --> 01:21:16,677
This is the best boy for you.

1376
01:21:18,153 --> 01:21:19,450
But papa, listen to me.

1377
01:21:19,521 --> 01:21:20,715
Papa, please.

1378
01:21:21,156 --> 01:21:24,148
Papa, I cannot live without Neel.
Papa, please papa.

1379
01:21:24,226 --> 01:21:25,557
I love Neel, papa.

1380
01:21:25,627 --> 01:21:26,821
I love Neel, papa.
- Papa.

1381
01:21:35,170 --> 01:21:36,228
Sunny!

1382
01:21:38,674 --> 01:21:39,732
Sunny!

1383
01:21:40,442 --> 01:21:41,500
Sunny!

1384
01:21:47,649 --> 01:21:48,707
Tanvi, you.

1385
01:21:50,185 --> 01:21:51,243
What are you doing here?

1386
01:21:51,320 --> 01:21:52,787
Waiting for you.

1387
01:21:53,188 --> 01:21:54,655
Why are you after me?

1388
01:21:54,723 --> 01:21:55,849
What do you want?

1389
01:21:57,125 --> 01:21:58,183
You!

1390
01:21:58,260 --> 01:21:59,784
It's futile to talk to you.

1391
01:21:59,861 --> 01:22:01,328
Please wear your clothes
and come out.

1392
01:22:16,678 --> 01:22:17,872
How am I looking?

1393
01:22:23,685 --> 01:22:24,743
My shirt.

1394
01:22:24,820 --> 01:22:26,219
Take my shirt off?

1395
01:22:30,359 --> 01:22:31,417
What are you doing?

1396
01:22:31,493 --> 01:22:34,223
You had said, take the shirt off.

1397
01:22:37,699 --> 01:22:41,226
Tanvi, I had already told
you that I love Maya.

1398
01:22:42,237 --> 01:22:44,171
Whether you love Maya
or anyone else...

1399
01:22:44,239 --> 01:22:46,764
...but I love only you.

1400
01:22:46,842 --> 01:22:48,742
But I don't love you.

1401
01:22:48,810 --> 01:22:52,246
Then that's your mistake,
correct it.

1402
01:22:52,314 --> 01:22:53,474
You have gone completely mad.

1403
01:22:53,548 --> 01:22:54,674
Mad!

1404
01:22:59,521 --> 01:23:00,579
Mad!

1405
01:23:01,790 --> 01:23:03,724
A mad girl can do anything!

1406
01:23:03,923 --> 01:23:06,653
Oh my God! I can't even tell you!

1407
01:23:06,792 --> 01:23:08,054
You are laughing, dude!

1408
01:23:08,260 --> 01:23:11,252
I barely managed to escape
from my father and uncle!

1409
01:23:11,530 --> 01:23:12,929
Why does it always happen with you?

1410
01:23:12,998 --> 01:23:14,124
What do I tell you?

1411
01:23:16,068 --> 01:23:19,128
Did you give our progress
report to Jordan!

1412
01:23:19,204 --> 01:23:20,728
I am in touch with Jordon daily!

1413
01:23:21,540 --> 01:23:25,203
For the first time I can't
understand this girl.

1414
01:23:25,277 --> 01:23:26,539
Who?

1415
01:23:26,612 --> 01:23:30,605
Tanvi! I know she has
fixed up everything!

1416
01:23:31,750 --> 01:23:34,275
But I don't why I feel
something is fishy.

1417
01:23:34,553 --> 01:23:35,679
Believe me.

1418
01:23:39,892 --> 01:23:40,950
Who is it?

1419
01:23:43,762 --> 01:23:45,627
Think of the devil and
the devil appears.

1420
01:23:45,698 --> 01:23:47,563
Hello!
- Yes!

1421
01:23:47,633 --> 01:23:49,624
I am sorry!
- For what?

1422
01:23:50,302 --> 01:23:52,566
You know! And to apologise
for that...

1423
01:23:52,638 --> 01:23:55,698
...this evening I have
kept a party for you.

1424
01:23:57,576 --> 01:24:00,568
If you don't come, I will think
you have not forgiven me.

1425
01:24:01,180 --> 01:24:03,910
Okay. I will try.
- Okay. Bye.

1426
01:24:13,058 --> 01:24:17,586
This is the new age mantra.

1427
01:24:19,999 --> 01:24:22,729
This is the new age mantra.

1428
01:24:34,013 --> 01:24:36,607
This is the new age mantra.

1429
01:24:40,619 --> 01:24:43,952
Om Namah Shivay.

1430
01:24:44,023 --> 01:24:47,618
Hail Radha Swami.

1431
01:24:50,763 --> 01:24:58,636
We spread the tantra of love
and peace all over the world.

1432
01:25:01,173 --> 01:25:04,301
This is the new age mantra.

1433
01:25:04,376 --> 01:25:07,903
This is the new age mantra.

1434
01:25:07,980 --> 01:25:11,313
This is the new age mantra.

1435
01:25:11,383 --> 01:25:14,784
This is the new age mantra.

1436
01:25:14,853 --> 01:25:18,118
Om Namah Shivay.

1437
01:25:18,190 --> 01:25:21,648
Hail Radha Swami.

1438
01:25:47,286 --> 01:25:49,686
What the heart says.

1439
01:25:50,889 --> 01:25:52,880
We do that.

1440
01:25:53,959 --> 01:25:55,893
Ask.

1441
01:25:56,028 --> 01:26:00,965
Why the whole world
is angry with us?

1442
01:26:01,033 --> 01:26:04,230
This is the new age mantra.

1443
01:26:04,703 --> 01:26:07,228
Don't stop us.

1444
01:26:07,706 --> 01:26:10,300
Don't taunt us.

1445
01:26:11,376 --> 01:26:17,713
Let us fly and touch our flight.

1446
01:26:18,250 --> 01:26:25,713
Dawn and dusk the
open sky calls us.

1447
01:26:28,327 --> 01:26:31,728
Om Namah Shivay.

1448
01:26:31,797 --> 01:26:35,130
Hail Radha Swami.

1449
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:38,465
Om Namah Shivay.

1450
01:26:38,737 --> 01:26:42,002
Hail Radha Swami.

1451
01:27:06,098 --> 01:27:11,764
We are the new generation.

1452
01:27:12,771 --> 01:27:16,036
Age is new and hopes are new.

1453
01:27:16,108 --> 01:27:19,305
We are sober in this intoxication.

1454
01:27:19,912 --> 01:27:22,779
This is the new age mantra.

1455
01:27:23,115 --> 01:27:25,242
We will bring.

1456
01:27:26,785 --> 01:27:29,049
New vibrations.

1457
01:27:29,788 --> 01:27:33,315
New destinations and new paths.

1458
01:27:33,392 --> 01:27:36,793
Our steps are zestful.

1459
01:27:36,862 --> 01:27:43,791
Someday we will erase all
the signs of hatred.

1460
01:27:47,206 --> 01:27:50,539
Om Namah Shivay.

1461
01:27:50,809 --> 01:27:53,869
Hail Radha Swami.

1462
01:27:53,946 --> 01:27:57,404
Om Namah Shivay.

1463
01:27:57,482 --> 01:28:00,940
Hail Radha Swami.

1464
01:28:01,019 --> 01:28:04,216
Om Namah Shivay.

1465
01:28:04,289 --> 01:28:07,816
Hail Radha Swami.

1466
01:28:15,500 --> 01:28:17,832
We are finished, man!
We are totally ruined!

1467
01:28:19,438 --> 01:28:20,496
All this...

1468
01:28:28,380 --> 01:28:29,438
This...

1469
01:28:30,315 --> 01:28:32,510
How did all this happen?

1470
01:28:32,584 --> 01:28:34,245
I doubted her.

1471
01:28:35,053 --> 01:28:38,045
And I had told you too that
I can't understand this girl.

1472
01:28:41,860 --> 01:28:43,054
We are finished, Sunny.

1473
01:28:50,535 --> 01:28:52,935
My plight too was the
same as your plight.

1474
01:28:53,872 --> 01:28:56,602
When I came here, I thought
I had entered the wrong office.

1475
01:28:57,542 --> 01:28:59,271
Nothing was here!

1476
01:29:00,212 --> 01:29:03,272
Computer, cash, cheque book.

1477
01:29:03,348 --> 01:29:04,872
Credit cards information.

1478
01:29:05,217 --> 01:29:08,618
Even all the database of
the business was gone!

1479
01:29:09,488 --> 01:29:11,479
Her party was an excuse.

1480
01:29:11,890 --> 01:29:12,948
So that you will be in the party...

1481
01:29:13,025 --> 01:29:14,890
...and here she will
steal everything.

1482
01:29:15,560 --> 01:29:17,892
'The number you have dialled
is switched off.'

1483
01:29:17,963 --> 01:29:19,487
'Please try after some time.'

1484
01:29:19,564 --> 01:29:20,895
She fooled us.
- 'Thank you.'

1485
01:29:21,500 --> 01:29:22,558
Her cell phone is switched off too.

1486
01:29:22,901 --> 01:29:25,893
Let's call the police, man! Come on!

1487
01:29:25,971 --> 01:29:27,370
What police!

1488
01:29:29,107 --> 01:29:32,907
We will not leave her! Where
the hell could she be?

1489
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:09,538
Good morning, ma'am.

1490
01:30:10,215 --> 01:30:11,944
Envelope please!
- Sure!

1491
01:30:12,951 --> 01:30:14,009
Here you are!

1492
01:30:15,087 --> 01:30:16,145
Okay!

1493
01:30:22,494 --> 01:30:25,952
Maya Fernandez!

1494
01:30:27,366 --> 01:30:28,424
Yes!

1495
01:30:31,103 --> 01:30:32,161
Okay!

1496
01:31:07,672 --> 01:31:09,264
Hello!
- Hello, Neel!

1497
01:31:10,008 --> 01:31:13,000
You lost my money and you
lost my trust, Neel!

1498
01:31:13,078 --> 01:31:15,546
But Jordon, it's Tanvi
who has done all this!

1499
01:31:15,680 --> 01:31:18,274
I don't care! You are fired, Neel!

1500
01:31:19,017 --> 01:31:20,541
Hello! Hello!

1501
01:31:25,290 --> 01:31:26,348
What happened?

1502
01:31:27,025 --> 01:31:30,017
Jordon thinks that I have
stolen the money!

1503
01:31:30,362 --> 01:31:32,296
Oh God!

1504
01:31:32,364 --> 01:31:35,162
I told you that something
is fishy, dude!

1505
01:31:35,300 --> 01:31:36,358
What has happened, Sunny?

1506
01:31:38,236 --> 01:31:40,636
In a moment a woman ruined us!

1507
01:31:41,039 --> 01:31:42,506
How can she ruin us?

1508
01:31:43,041 --> 01:31:46,306
If we don't make her plight worst,
then our life is useless!

1509
01:31:46,378 --> 01:31:47,504
What are you saying, brother?

1510
01:31:47,646 --> 01:31:50,171
You will make her plight bad when
you will get hold of her.

1511
01:31:50,315 --> 01:31:52,442
Shall I tell you something?

1512
01:31:52,717 --> 01:31:54,514
Rajesh has gone to USA!

1513
01:31:54,786 --> 01:32:00,383
And this Tanvi is with him!
It's their conspiracy!

1514
01:32:01,059 --> 01:32:05,587
We should go to USA. Yes,
we have to go!

1515
01:32:05,730 --> 01:32:08,062
But how? Somebody has
to stay here also!

1516
01:32:08,133 --> 01:32:10,601
Don't worry. Soy Chi
and I will stay here!

1517
01:32:11,536 --> 01:32:12,594
That's not a bad idea!

1518
01:32:23,081 --> 01:32:25,811
Everything went as per the plan.

1519
01:32:26,418 --> 01:32:29,478
But I had not thought
about my arrest.

1520
01:32:29,621 --> 01:32:32,749
I am confused, who told you this?

1521
01:32:33,825 --> 01:32:35,087
Mr. Rajesh!

1522
01:32:45,437 --> 01:32:47,098
If he had not helped
us... then maybe...

1523
01:32:47,172 --> 01:32:49,834
...we couldn't have arrested you.

1524
01:32:53,111 --> 01:32:55,102
Thank you so much. Thank you.

1525
01:32:55,180 --> 01:32:59,173
No, Neel. Thank your friend Sunny.

1526
01:33:00,118 --> 01:33:01,176
Sunny?

1527
01:33:01,253 --> 01:33:03,118
Yes! If Sunny had not come to me...

1528
01:33:03,188 --> 01:33:05,122
...and if he had not
reminded me my duty...

1529
01:33:05,190 --> 01:33:08,182
...then maybe I could
have never done this.

1530
01:33:09,127 --> 01:33:10,185
Where is Sunny?

1531
01:33:10,462 --> 01:33:13,124
He has gone to the bank
with the FBI officer...

1532
01:33:13,198 --> 01:33:15,530
...where Tanvi has deposited
the fraud money.

1533
01:33:15,734 --> 01:33:18,464
Rajesh, you didn't
do the right thing.

1534
01:33:18,537 --> 01:33:19,731
Shut up, Tanvi!

1535
01:33:20,739 --> 01:33:23,674
For a trivial matter, you
ruined Neel's career!

1536
01:33:23,742 --> 01:33:26,870
You think a beautiful girl's
insult is a trivial matter?

1537
01:33:27,145 --> 01:33:28,669
You are a mad, crazy girl!

1538
01:33:31,816 --> 01:33:32,874
Yes!

1539
01:33:35,153 --> 01:33:36,211
Okay!

1540
01:33:36,288 --> 01:33:37,346
Mr. Neel!
- Yes, sir!

1541
01:33:37,422 --> 01:33:38,480
Good news for you!

1542
01:33:39,157 --> 01:33:42,422
85% of your money
has been recovered.

1543
01:33:42,494 --> 01:33:45,156
And it will be given to you after
the formalities are over.

1544
01:33:45,230 --> 01:33:47,824
Mr. Neel, you may go now.
- Thank you, officer!

1545
01:33:49,167 --> 01:33:50,566
Thank you once again, Rajesh!

1546
01:33:51,836 --> 01:33:52,894
You are welcome.

1547
01:33:53,905 --> 01:33:55,167
Thank you!
- Take care!

1548
01:33:56,174 --> 01:33:57,698
Okay, Ms. Tanvi! Let's go!

1549
01:34:01,179 --> 01:34:02,646
Ladies and Gentlemen!

1550
01:34:03,181 --> 01:34:07,174
I take the honour to announce
the engagement...

1551
01:34:07,252 --> 01:34:11,586
...of my lovely daughter Maya
to dashing Michael Pereira!

1552
01:34:12,190 --> 01:34:15,853
Son of shipping magnet
Mr. Albert Pereira!

1553
01:34:28,206 --> 01:34:29,264
Lovely!

1554
01:35:12,851 --> 01:35:13,977
What are you doing, sir?

1555
01:35:14,386 --> 01:35:15,444
Due to the high tide...

1556
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:17,852
...the starfish gets washed
away on the shore.

1557
01:35:18,590 --> 01:35:21,252
Some are washed back into the water.

1558
01:35:21,660 --> 01:35:25,790
And some are left here... to die.

1559
01:35:25,864 --> 01:35:27,263
What difference will it make?

1560
01:35:28,266 --> 01:35:31,599
There are so many starfishes
here. Nobody cares.

1561
01:35:37,409 --> 01:35:38,535
It made a difference to that one!

1562
01:35:45,283 --> 01:35:47,683
Neel! Do you see the starfishes?

1563
01:35:53,558 --> 01:35:56,288
The way it can't live
without water...

1564
01:35:56,361 --> 01:35:59,956
...the same way you can't
live without Maya.

1565
01:36:01,299 --> 01:36:03,961
Before it's too late, Neel,
give her a call.

1566
01:36:04,035 --> 01:36:06,503
Do the right thing. Give
her a call. Go, meet her.

1567
01:36:11,443 --> 01:36:12,501
Knock once more.

1568
01:36:16,448 --> 01:36:17,506
Yes!

1569
01:36:18,049 --> 01:36:20,313
Hey, man! I didn't order
any pizza. What's up?

1570
01:36:21,653 --> 01:36:23,917
Actually we wanted to
find out about Maya.

1571
01:36:24,322 --> 01:36:25,584
The girl who stays here.

1572
01:36:25,657 --> 01:36:26,919
Hey, man. I have been
here for 4 months.

1573
01:36:26,991 --> 01:36:29,516
No girl lives here. Except
for on Friday nights.

1574
01:36:29,661 --> 01:36:30,719
Got my drift?

1575
01:36:31,329 --> 01:36:32,387
What?

1576
01:36:35,066 --> 01:36:36,328
Oh!

1577
01:36:44,476 --> 01:36:46,467
He is an Indian. Let's ask him.

1578
01:36:46,611 --> 01:36:47,669
Indian!

1579
01:36:49,013 --> 01:36:50,071
Sir, greetings.
- Greetings!

1580
01:36:50,348 --> 01:36:51,406
Do you live here?
- Tell me.

1581
01:36:51,683 --> 01:36:53,548
Sir, a family used to live
in your neighbourhood.

1582
01:36:53,618 --> 01:36:55,347
A beautiful girl called Maya.

1583
01:36:55,954 --> 01:36:57,546
Maya!
- Yes, Maya!

1584
01:36:57,689 --> 01:36:59,748
Do you know where she has gone?

1585
01:37:00,558 --> 01:37:02,082
I don't know where she has gone.

1586
01:37:02,827 --> 01:37:05,625
But she was very sad while leaving.

1587
01:37:06,498 --> 01:37:08,762
She was really upset.
- Thank you.

1588
01:37:11,636 --> 01:37:15,504
I am telling you, brother. Maya
didn't leave willingly.

1589
01:37:15,573 --> 01:37:18,701
Her father forcefully took
her with him. Note it down.

1590
01:37:19,043 --> 01:37:21,568
Mr. Kumar, do you know Mr. Neel?

1591
01:37:22,514 --> 01:37:23,572
Kumar sir!

1592
01:37:23,648 --> 01:37:26,378
I know him very well.

1593
01:37:26,651 --> 01:37:29,711
He was framed in a fraud case.
Now he is acquitted.

1594
01:37:29,988 --> 01:37:31,649
Would you like to say something?

1595
01:37:31,723 --> 01:37:35,386
Whether the time is good
or bad... a gem is a gem.

1596
01:37:35,593 --> 01:37:37,390
But when time is bad
many people think...

1597
01:37:37,462 --> 01:37:40,056
...that gem is a piece of glass.

1598
01:37:41,399 --> 01:37:44,926
But you know, I always knew
that Neel is a diamond.

1599
01:37:45,537 --> 01:37:48,802
A very priceless diamond.
One in a million.

1600
01:38:01,019 --> 01:38:04,682
I am sorry, Neel! I am so sorry!

1601
01:38:06,958 --> 01:38:08,687
What the hell! Didn't I trust you?

1602
01:38:19,437 --> 01:38:20,495
Neel!

1603
01:38:20,572 --> 01:38:22,767
Neel! I am not Neel! I am Steve!

1604
01:38:22,841 --> 01:38:25,435
But I can be whoever you
want me to be, baby!

1605
01:38:25,510 --> 01:38:26,568
Shut up!

1606
01:38:29,647 --> 01:38:32,844
I need to find you, Neel.
I need to find you.

1607
01:38:35,787 --> 01:38:36,845
Papa!
- Yes.

1608
01:38:37,989 --> 01:38:40,856
Papa, I want to go to New York.

1609
01:38:41,459 --> 01:38:43,188
New York? What for?

1610
01:38:44,929 --> 01:38:48,524
Dear, you can go after the wedding.
It's only a few days.

1611
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:52,060
Papa! It's the girls
stuff, you know.

1612
01:38:52,604 --> 01:38:54,595
I need to buy a few personal things.

1613
01:38:56,074 --> 01:39:00,079
I see! I see! Look, dear.
Be back on time.

1614
01:39:00,080 --> 01:39:01,011
Yes, papa!

1615
01:39:01,479 --> 01:39:03,140
Love you!
- Thanks, papa!

1616
01:39:21,499 --> 01:39:22,557
Neel!

1617
01:39:32,777 --> 01:39:33,835
Neel!

1618
01:39:38,850 --> 01:39:40,977
Come on, Neel! Let's think!

1619
01:39:41,519 --> 01:39:43,180
How can we get in touch with her?

1620
01:40:16,888 --> 01:40:20,551
I had not thought.

1621
01:40:20,825 --> 01:40:24,226
I had not known.

1622
01:40:24,696 --> 01:40:32,228
Such a moment would come.

1623
01:40:32,570 --> 01:40:39,703
I will get loneliness in love.

1624
01:40:40,578 --> 01:40:47,575
My beloved will part from me.

1625
01:40:48,586 --> 01:40:55,116
I will lose all the joys.

1626
01:40:56,260 --> 01:41:03,132
I will cry in loneliness.

1627
01:41:05,803 --> 01:41:09,136
Smilingly. Smilingly.

1628
01:41:09,741 --> 01:41:12,938
Smilingly. Smilingly.

1629
01:41:13,745 --> 01:41:17,010
Smilingly. Smilingly.

1630
01:41:17,615 --> 01:41:21,142
Smilingly. Smilingly.

1631
01:41:21,619 --> 01:41:25,077
Smilingly. Smilingly.

1632
01:41:25,623 --> 01:41:28,285
Smilingly. Smilingly.

1633
01:41:29,627 --> 01:41:33,154
Smilingly. Smilingly.

1634
01:41:33,631 --> 01:41:36,623
Smilingly. Smilingly.

1635
01:41:53,117 --> 01:41:54,641
Hi, Nick!
- Hi!

1636
01:41:54,719 --> 01:41:56,710
Have you got any news on Neel?

1637
01:41:56,788 --> 01:41:59,188
Sorry! Haven't seen him in ages!

1638
01:42:00,058 --> 01:42:02,788
I am not sure what to tell you.
Is everything okay?

1639
01:42:02,994 --> 01:42:05,258
Yes. Everything is okay!

1640
01:42:11,202 --> 01:42:12,260
Hi!

1641
01:42:13,004 --> 01:42:14,062
Good morning, sir!

1642
01:42:35,293 --> 01:42:36,692
Today I am going to talk
about something...

1643
01:42:36,761 --> 01:42:38,695
...that is very important
in our lives.

1644
01:42:39,697 --> 01:42:40,891
Something we all cherish.

1645
01:42:41,299 --> 01:42:44,700
And that is the relationships
in our lives.

1646
01:42:45,103 --> 01:42:47,697
We all want to enjoy
great relationships...

1647
01:42:47,772 --> 01:42:51,037
...with people who are
near and dear to us.

1648
01:42:51,309 --> 01:42:54,244
Relationships are made in heaven.

1649
01:42:54,912 --> 01:42:57,039
But they have to be maintained
here on earth.

1650
01:42:59,183 --> 01:43:02,710
Every morning you should
make the decision...

1651
01:43:02,787 --> 01:43:05,915
...to stay in love with the
one you fell in love with.

1652
01:43:06,724 --> 01:43:08,715
You should always be thinking...

1653
01:43:08,793 --> 01:43:12,058
...what can I do today to make
this relationship better.

1654
01:43:12,730 --> 01:43:15,858
Men! Don't wait for her
to make you happy!

1655
01:43:16,267 --> 01:43:17,928
Do the things that make her happy!

1656
01:43:18,736 --> 01:43:22,729
Ladies! You don't love him
because you need him!

1657
01:43:22,807 --> 01:43:24,468
You need him because you love him!

1658
01:43:25,743 --> 01:43:27,210
Love is unconditional!

1659
01:43:28,012 --> 01:43:29,741
Love is like a question.'

1660
01:43:30,481 --> 01:43:32,415
'Love has eyes and
love has eyelids.'

1661
01:43:32,750 --> 01:43:34,877
Hello! Hello, Neel!
- Hello!

1662
01:43:35,286 --> 01:43:36,810
Sunny here!
- Hi, Sunny!

1663
01:43:36,888 --> 01:43:38,822
Neel! Neel!
- Hang on!

1664
01:43:38,890 --> 01:43:39,948
Listen! Listen! Listen!

1665
01:43:40,024 --> 01:43:41,355
Yes, Sunny! Tell me! Tell me!

1666
01:43:41,425 --> 01:43:43,290
Are you friend of Neel? I said yes!

1667
01:43:43,361 --> 01:43:46,513
He told me Maya has been
looking for you!

1668
01:43:46,514 --> 01:43:46,888
What!

1669
01:43:47,765 --> 01:43:49,096
Maya has been looking for you!

1670
01:43:49,167 --> 01:43:51,761
I am coming! I am coming!
I am coming! I am leaving!

1671
01:43:52,103 --> 01:43:53,161
I am coming! I am coming!

1672
01:43:53,771 --> 01:43:54,829
Thank you!

1673
01:44:17,528 --> 01:44:20,793
Kumar sir! Kumar sir!

1674
01:44:26,470 --> 01:44:29,268
Kumar sir! Kumar sir!

1675
01:44:35,880 --> 01:44:37,006
Kumar sir!

1676
01:44:52,496 --> 01:44:53,827
Kumar sir!

1677
01:44:56,834 --> 01:44:57,892
Kumar sir!

1678
01:45:24,395 --> 01:45:25,453
Neel!

1679
01:45:27,265 --> 01:45:32,999
Neel! Neel! Neel!

1680
01:45:33,871 --> 01:45:35,463
I am coming Neel!

1681
01:45:37,141 --> 01:45:41,202
Maya! Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

1682
01:45:41,279 --> 01:45:43,338
Come, come, come, come, come.

1683
01:45:50,288 --> 01:45:51,880
Do you like pushing me down?

1684
01:45:51,956 --> 01:45:55,357
Yes, you look so cute
when you fall Mr. Pro.

1685
01:46:04,568 --> 01:46:05,899
You still here.

1686
01:46:06,037 --> 01:46:08,301
I will have her call again,
when she comes here.

1687
01:46:09,907 --> 01:46:10,965
It's alright.

1688
01:46:11,042 --> 01:46:12,100
I will wait.

1689
01:46:25,122 --> 01:46:27,647
'Oh God, please help
me in finding Neel.'

1690
01:46:32,930 --> 01:46:33,988
'Amen.'

1691
01:46:41,939 --> 01:46:42,997
Hello.

1692
01:46:43,074 --> 01:46:44,132
Hi dad.

1693
01:46:44,208 --> 01:46:46,938
All the guests have started
coming for the marriage...

1694
01:46:47,011 --> 01:46:49,946
...and they are all asking for you.

1695
01:46:50,548 --> 01:46:51,606
When are you coming?

1696
01:46:52,083 --> 01:46:55,211
Yes, actually the dress alteration
took a little time.

1697
01:46:55,286 --> 01:46:57,083
But you don't worry,
I will be there on time.

1698
01:46:57,355 --> 01:46:58,413
'Ok, dear. Bye.'

1699
01:47:06,163 --> 01:47:07,221
Maya.
- What?

1700
01:47:08,232 --> 01:47:09,494
Maya.
- What happened?

1701
01:47:50,608 --> 01:47:56,672
God does some strange things.

1702
01:47:57,615 --> 01:48:04,020
God does some strange things.

1703
01:48:04,755 --> 01:48:11,024
My sweetheart should never
separate from me.

1704
01:48:12,029 --> 01:48:18,229
My sweetheart should never
separate from me.

1705
01:48:19,170 --> 01:48:25,507
God does some strange things.

1706
01:48:26,510 --> 01:48:28,239
Without my darling,
without my darling.

1707
01:48:28,312 --> 01:48:30,041
I will die without my darling.

1708
01:48:30,114 --> 01:48:31,775
Without my darling,
without my darling.

1709
01:48:32,049 --> 01:48:33,641
I will die without my darling.

1710
01:48:33,717 --> 01:48:35,446
Without my darling,
without my darling.

1711
01:48:35,519 --> 01:48:37,248
I will die without my darling.

1712
01:48:37,321 --> 01:48:39,050
Without my darling,
without my darling.

1713
01:48:39,123 --> 01:48:41,057
I will die without my darling.

1714
01:49:09,753 --> 01:49:16,625
My desires say to me.

1715
01:49:17,094 --> 01:49:24,091
Bring my beloved in front of me.

1716
01:49:24,168 --> 01:49:30,767
That's a request.

1717
01:49:31,442 --> 01:49:37,642
Spare me my life or kill me.

1718
01:49:39,316 --> 01:49:46,381
My shattered dreams are
scattered everywhere.

1719
01:49:46,457 --> 01:49:53,454
I wandered everywhere,
in search of my beloved.

1720
01:49:53,531 --> 01:50:03,133
Listen, listen to my heartbeats.

1721
01:50:03,741 --> 01:50:10,146
My sweetheart should never
separate from me.

1722
01:50:11,215 --> 01:50:12,807
Without my darling,
without my darling.

1723
01:50:12,883 --> 01:50:14,612
I will die without my darling.

1724
01:50:14,685 --> 01:50:16,346
Without my darling,
without my darling.

1725
01:50:16,420 --> 01:50:18,217
I will die without my darling.

1726
01:50:45,849 --> 01:50:47,840
Smilingly! Smilingly!

1727
01:50:47,918 --> 01:50:49,180
Neel!

1728
01:50:49,253 --> 01:50:52,711
Neel!
- Smilingly! Smilingly!

1729
01:50:52,923 --> 01:50:56,324
Smilingly! Smilingly!

1730
01:50:56,393 --> 01:50:58,190
Neel!
- Smilingly! Smilingly!

1731
01:50:58,262 --> 01:50:59,320
Excuse me.

1732
01:51:00,264 --> 01:51:02,732
Smilingly! Smilingly!

1733
01:51:02,800 --> 01:51:03,858
Neel!

1734
01:51:03,934 --> 01:51:06,528
Smilingly! Smilingly!

1735
01:51:06,604 --> 01:51:07,662
Neel!

1736
01:52:15,606 --> 01:52:17,335
I have not seen him
around the campus.

1737
01:52:18,342 --> 01:52:20,367
But I can check to find out
when he last logged in.

1738
01:52:20,444 --> 01:52:21,502
Anything sir.

1739
01:52:21,779 --> 01:52:23,269
Any information that you
give me about Neel...

1740
01:52:23,347 --> 01:52:24,575
...that will be great.

1741
01:52:37,027 --> 01:52:40,292
Well Maya, it seems like
he has not logged in...

1742
01:52:40,364 --> 01:52:42,457
...since he left for India.

1743
01:52:42,533 --> 01:52:45,798
But does it show his address
or anything sir?

1744
01:52:46,036 --> 01:52:47,765
I am not supposed to give that out.

1745
01:52:49,340 --> 01:52:51,308
But I can tell you that,
his address is the same...

1746
01:52:51,375 --> 01:52:53,309
...as when he went to school.

1747
01:52:54,812 --> 01:52:55,870
Thank you sir.

1748
01:52:56,580 --> 01:52:57,638
By the way.

1749
01:52:58,549 --> 01:53:01,382
You heard of him getting cleared
of all those charges...

1750
01:53:01,452 --> 01:53:05,047
...right.
- Yes. I saw the news.

1751
01:53:05,322 --> 01:53:06,380
Good.

1752
01:53:09,326 --> 01:53:11,055
Poor kid, he really
went through a lot.

1753
01:53:12,730 --> 01:53:13,788
He is a fighter.

1754
01:53:14,365 --> 01:53:15,730
A real fighter.

1755
01:53:20,671 --> 01:53:23,071
I think I have lost everything
after going to India.

1756
01:53:27,411 --> 01:53:30,346
Tell me one thing, did she
tell you her address...

1757
01:53:30,414 --> 01:53:32,575
...or the address of any of her
relative during the meeting.

1758
01:53:32,649 --> 01:53:33,707
Remember.

1759
01:53:33,784 --> 01:53:34,842
Try to remember.

1760
01:54:08,385 --> 01:54:09,716
You mean Maya's wedding.

1761
01:54:10,487 --> 01:54:12,455
She has gone for her
grand-daughter's marriage.

1762
01:54:51,895 --> 01:54:52,953
Hello.
- Hi Sunny.

1763
01:54:53,030 --> 01:54:54,088
Where are you, brother?

1764
01:54:54,431 --> 01:54:55,864
I am waiting for you dude.

1765
01:54:58,035 --> 01:55:00,094
Sunny, Maya is getting married.

1766
01:55:00,437 --> 01:55:01,495
What?

1767
01:55:02,773 --> 01:55:03,831
Where?

1768
01:55:05,108 --> 01:55:06,166
I don't know that.

1769
01:55:06,710 --> 01:55:08,177
Oh my God.

1770
01:55:12,583 --> 01:55:13,641
Neel.

1771
01:55:13,784 --> 01:55:15,445
If Maya is getting married...

1772
01:55:15,519 --> 01:55:18,454
...then she will surely
invite the principal.

1773
01:55:18,956 --> 01:55:20,446
Good morning, sir. Sir, actually...

1774
01:55:20,524 --> 01:55:23,857
...the thing is that I wanted
to find out about Maya.

1775
01:55:23,927 --> 01:55:26,919
You won't believe this,
but Maya was here.

1776
01:55:30,501 --> 01:55:34,460
I haven't seen her looking
so... unlike Maya.

1777
01:55:34,538 --> 01:55:36,768
I haven't seen her not smiling.

1778
01:55:37,207 --> 01:55:41,871
But sir...
- Sir, did she leave anything, mobile number.

1779
01:55:42,479 --> 01:55:44,504
So we can call her.
- No.

1780
01:55:44,581 --> 01:55:45,639
She didn't.

1781
01:55:47,484 --> 01:55:49,850
Thank you so much
for your time, sir. Thank you.

1782
01:55:50,487 --> 01:55:52,079
Thank you sir, thank you very much.

1783
01:55:54,958 --> 01:55:56,016
Wait.

1784
01:55:57,494 --> 01:55:59,086
I think I have something
that could help.

1785
01:56:10,941 --> 01:56:12,499
My assistant received
Maya's wedding card...

1786
01:56:12,576 --> 01:56:14,237
...about 2 weeks ago.

1787
01:56:15,512 --> 01:56:16,570
Oh my God!

1788
01:56:18,181 --> 01:56:19,239
Today!

1789
01:56:23,086 --> 01:56:26,021
Hey brother, you know this
church is very far away.

1790
01:56:26,089 --> 01:56:27,147
How will you reach there?

1791
01:56:29,593 --> 01:56:30,651
I will reach there.

1792
01:56:31,028 --> 01:56:33,519
This is a 4 hour journey,
and you say...

1793
01:56:33,597 --> 01:56:35,997
...you want to reach
for the marriage.

1794
01:56:39,102 --> 01:56:40,592
I will reach there, don't worry.

1795
01:56:40,938 --> 01:56:41,996
Fine, go ahead.

1796
01:56:52,115 --> 01:56:53,707
How will you reach in such traffic?

1797
01:56:59,590 --> 01:57:00,648
I am going Sunny.

1798
01:57:00,724 --> 01:57:08,563
Every moment, every place

1799
01:57:08,632 --> 01:57:14,036
I think only about her.

1800
01:57:14,571 --> 01:57:20,976
I know,

1801
01:57:21,878 --> 01:57:28,147
she can't live without me.

1802
01:57:29,853 --> 01:57:36,884
Her memories stalk me everywhere.

1803
01:57:36,960 --> 01:57:44,162
This loneliness haunts
me every minute.

1804
01:57:44,234 --> 01:57:53,666
I am helpless, time is against me.

1805
01:57:54,277 --> 01:58:00,705
God does some strange things.

1806
01:58:01,351 --> 01:58:07,847
God does some strange things.

1807
01:58:08,625 --> 01:58:14,860
My sweetheart should never
separate from me.

1808
01:58:15,932 --> 01:58:17,627
Without my darling,
without my darling.

1809
01:58:17,701 --> 01:58:19,692
I will die without my darling.

1810
01:58:19,770 --> 01:58:21,635
O Lord, O Lord.

1811
01:58:21,705 --> 01:58:23,297
I will die, O Lord.

1812
01:58:35,085 --> 01:58:36,143
Excuse me.

1813
01:58:37,154 --> 01:58:38,212
Yes.

1814
01:58:39,756 --> 01:58:42,190
Is the wedding over?

1815
01:58:42,659 --> 01:58:44,388
Yes, it's over, son.

1816
01:58:44,961 --> 01:58:46,792
You must be late or something.

1817
01:58:49,399 --> 01:58:50,661
Something like that.

1818
01:58:58,175 --> 01:58:59,233
Don't worry son.

1819
01:59:01,278 --> 01:59:02,905
You will get your present back.

1820
01:59:06,249 --> 01:59:07,307
Excuse me.

1821
01:59:07,384 --> 01:59:10,353
The truth is the wedding
never even began.

1822
01:59:13,023 --> 01:59:15,184
The bride called it
off this morning.

1823
01:59:17,027 --> 01:59:19,996
Called it off.
- Yes.

1824
01:59:20,430 --> 01:59:22,159
Any idea where she could have gone?

1825
01:59:23,200 --> 01:59:24,690
No, sorry.

1826
01:59:27,704 --> 01:59:28,762
Thank you.

1827
02:00:24,761 --> 02:00:25,819
I am sorry.

1828
02:00:27,497 --> 02:00:28,759
I know I am stupid.

1829
02:00:30,167 --> 02:00:31,225
I am sorry.

1830
02:00:31,301 --> 02:00:32,359
I know I am stupid.

1831
02:00:32,435 --> 02:00:33,493
I love you.

1832
02:00:40,076 --> 02:00:42,772
Whether you receive joy
or sorrow in love.

1833
02:00:42,846 --> 02:00:45,337
Keep walking on this path.

1834
02:00:45,415 --> 02:00:47,883
Whether you receive joy
or sorrow in love.

1835
02:00:47,951 --> 02:00:50,511
Keep walking on this path.

1836
02:00:50,821 --> 02:00:53,289
Smilingly. Smilingly.

1837
02:00:53,423 --> 02:00:55,823
Smilingly. Smilingly.

1838
02:00:56,092 --> 02:00:58,356
Smilingly. Smilingly.

1839
02:00:58,795 --> 02:01:00,956
Smilingly. Smilingly.

1840
02:01:01,298 --> 02:01:03,459
Follow your heart!
Follow your heart!

1841
02:01:03,533 --> 02:01:05,865
Follow your heart!
Follow your heart!

1842
02:01:06,203 --> 02:01:08,797
Whether you receive joy
or sorrow in love.

1843
02:01:08,872 --> 02:01:11,204
Keep walking on this path.

1844
02:01:11,274 --> 02:01:13,902
Whether you receive joy
or sorrow in love.

1845
02:01:13,977 --> 02:01:16,468
Keep walking on this path.

1846
02:01:16,980 --> 02:01:19,380
Smilingly. Smilingly.

1847
02:01:19,816 --> 02:01:21,841
Smilingly. Smilingly.

1848
02:01:22,185 --> 02:01:24,551
Smilingly. Smilingly.

1849
02:01:24,821 --> 02:01:27,289
Smilingly. Smilingly.

1850
02:01:52,415 --> 02:01:57,079
In my eyes and my thoughts...

1851
02:01:57,587 --> 02:02:02,524
...would dwell love.

1852
02:02:02,893 --> 02:02:07,592
Whatever be the objective,
whatever be the ambiance.

1853
02:02:08,098 --> 02:02:12,967
We should always be together.

1854
02:02:13,236 --> 02:02:18,173
May we always love each other.

1855
02:02:18,541 --> 02:02:24,878
May we carry on loving each other.

1856
02:02:24,948 --> 02:02:27,212
Laughing-laughing.

1857
02:02:27,550 --> 02:02:29,882
Laughing-laughing.

1858
02:02:30,120 --> 02:02:32,554
Laughing-laughing.

1859
02:02:32,622 --> 02:02:35,113
Laughing-laughing.

1860
02:02:49,906 --> 02:02:54,570
you are the only
one spoken and debated about.

1861
02:02:55,078 --> 02:03:00,106
I am not aware
whether its night or day.

1862
02:03:00,183 --> 02:03:05,052
I'm in your arms
and you are in mine.

1863
02:03:05,588 --> 02:03:10,457
I am not worried
about anything now.

1864
02:03:10,927 --> 02:03:15,591
I am not worried
about anyone now.

1865
02:03:15,932 --> 02:03:22,360
Or life will pass by this way.

1866
02:03:22,439 --> 02:03:24,930
Laughing-laughing.

1867
02:03:25,008 --> 02:03:27,101
Laughing-laughing.

1868
02:03:27,610 --> 02:03:29,942
Laughing-laughing.

1869
02:03:30,013 --> 02:03:31,674
Laughing-laughing.
