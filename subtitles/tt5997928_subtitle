1
00:00:44,241 --> 00:00:45,641
Daya!

2
00:00:46,961 --> 00:00:50,921
Daya!

3
00:00:53,121 --> 00:00:54,801
Come home, son!

4
00:00:57,481 --> 00:00:59,401
The village

5
00:01:01,121 --> 00:01:03,041
was empty.

6
00:01:03,841 --> 00:01:04,841
It's ok, Dad.

7
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:12,361
But.. Mom kept calling for me.

8
00:01:12,641 --> 00:01:15,041
And..
- I've finally got peace. - And I kept walking.

9
00:01:15,121 --> 00:01:16,321
Dad..

10
00:01:16,721 --> 00:01:19,641
I don't know where I was going.

11
00:01:20,401 --> 00:01:24,441
- But it was quiet there.
- Dad..

12
00:01:26,401 --> 00:01:28,921
You have told us about this
dream a number of times.

13
00:01:29,161 --> 00:01:30,961
It's okay.

14
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:32,601
But why do you bother?

15
00:01:33,641 --> 00:01:37,641
You looked after your
mother really well.

16
00:01:38,441 --> 00:01:39,881
As we do for you, too,
Father-in-law.

17
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:44,761
If I remember correctly

18
00:01:45,121 --> 00:01:47,681
somebody kept calling
you constantly.

19
00:01:48,681 --> 00:01:53,441
And you kept saying

20
00:01:53,761 --> 00:01:56,121
that it hasn't been done, yet.

21
00:01:57,081 --> 00:01:58,581
As if someone was.

22
00:01:58,582 --> 00:02:00,081
As if someone was

23
00:02:00,361 --> 00:02:03,161
waiting for it to happen.

24
00:02:04,121 --> 00:02:08,041
And is getting scared that if
it doesn't happen then

25
00:02:09,001 --> 00:02:10,961
- they'll have to come back again tomorrow.
- Dad.

26
00:02:11,801 --> 00:02:13,721
I'll have to go now.
There's a lot of work to do.

27
00:02:14,561 --> 00:02:15,881
I, too, am leaving.

28
00:02:16,881 --> 00:02:17,801
Where?

29
00:02:17,881 --> 00:02:19,081
Tomorrow, the cow benefaction.

30
00:02:20,161 --> 00:02:21,961
- And the day after, Varanasi.
- What?

31
00:02:23,241 --> 00:02:24,601
What are you saying?

32
00:02:28,201 --> 00:02:30,921
I think my time is near.

33
00:02:32,961 --> 00:02:35,321
And I think

34
00:02:35,441 --> 00:02:39,321
I am ready to die now.

35
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:44,281
But I don't want to die here.

36
00:02:46,401 --> 00:02:50,321
Before anything happens to me.

37
00:02:52,321 --> 00:02:53,921
I want to go to Varanasi.

38
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:55,041
Dad!

39
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:58,441
Nobody is going anywhere.

40
00:03:00,201 --> 00:03:02,401
Come on...
I'll prepare the supper.

41
00:03:03,001 --> 00:03:04,161
Alright then.

42
00:03:04,721 --> 00:03:06,041
I will go myself.

43
00:03:08,841 --> 00:03:10,041
I will go alone.

44
00:03:25,001 --> 00:03:26,241
Did you say anything?

45
00:03:26,441 --> 00:03:28,561
- Why would I say anything?
- So, then?

46
00:03:28,881 --> 00:03:30,961
How would I know?
It's always something or the other.

47
00:03:39,201 --> 00:03:40,921
Take some holy
water in your hands.

48
00:03:43,281 --> 00:03:44,281
Make your resolution.

49
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:46,481
Would you make some donations?

50
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:47,881
Place it here.

51
00:03:59,761 --> 00:04:01,521
- Say, 'I'. - 'I.'
- Say, 'I'. - 'I.'

52
00:04:02,601 --> 00:04:04,401
Tell your full name.

53
00:04:05,281 --> 00:04:06,401
Dayanand Kumar.

54
00:04:06,561 --> 00:04:08,801
- 'I'm donating..
- I'm donating..'

55
00:04:08,961 --> 00:04:11,361
'A cow!
- A cow.'

56
00:04:13,521 --> 00:04:16,441
Now everyone can pay their
respects to the Holy cow

57
00:04:16,521 --> 00:04:17,801
and take it's blessings.

58
00:04:25,481 --> 00:04:27,721
- Take blessings..
- I have to take your leave now.

59
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:28,801
Hold on..

60
00:04:29,601 --> 00:04:31,001
Yes, tell me?

61
00:04:31,081 --> 00:04:32,121
- As per the stars..
- Yes.

62
00:04:32,281 --> 00:04:34,561
September would be the best
month for Sunita's wedding.

63
00:04:34,681 --> 00:04:36,841
- Okay.
- The weather would be pleasant.

64
00:04:36,921 --> 00:04:38,137
- Sunita, hurry up!
- Just a minute!

65
00:04:38,161 --> 00:04:41,241
And all the planets
are aligned perfectly.

66
00:04:41,441 --> 00:04:42,457
I'll take care of it once I'm back.

67
00:04:42,481 --> 00:04:43,481
Yes, but you must hurry

68
00:04:43,721 --> 00:04:44,641
- and let me know at the earliest.
- Yes.

69
00:04:44,721 --> 00:04:47,441
You know how busy it gets
during the wedding season.

70
00:04:47,881 --> 00:04:49,641
Yes, of course.
Thank you so much.

71
00:04:49,921 --> 00:04:50,961
Make sure you decide soon.

72
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:53,401
- And let me know if you need anything else.
- Yes.

73
00:04:53,881 --> 00:04:55,601
For sure.
- Greetings. - Greetings.

74
00:05:05,401 --> 00:05:07,321
- Sunita!
- Coming, just a minute.

75
00:05:10,121 --> 00:05:11,481
- Always getting us late.
- Sorry!

76
00:05:11,881 --> 00:05:13,121
- Come back soon.
- Yes.

77
00:05:27,521 --> 00:05:28,681
Let's go.

78
00:05:37,761 --> 00:05:39,041
Sir,
the boss has called for you.

79
00:05:41,281 --> 00:05:43,041
I'll be right back.

80
00:05:43,121 --> 00:05:45,081
Sir, should I wait or leave?

81
00:05:46,401 --> 00:05:47,481
No, please wait.

82
00:05:50,241 --> 00:05:52,081
- Sir, could you sign this?
- Take a seat.

83
00:05:53,601 --> 00:05:54,601
- Did you check it?
- Yes.

84
00:05:56,801 --> 00:05:58,321
- So, tell me one thing.
- Yes, sir.

85
00:05:58,881 --> 00:06:00,777
- Is the Ganges holy because of Varanasi?
- Is the Ganges holy because of Varanasi?

86
00:06:00,801 --> 00:06:02,441
Or is Varanasi holy
because of the Ganges?

87
00:06:02,761 --> 00:06:04,481
I don't know, sir. Why?

88
00:06:04,841 --> 00:06:07,281
I was just thinking

89
00:06:08,081 --> 00:06:10,681
- if Ganges is the reason..
- Yes.

90
00:06:10,801 --> 00:06:12,881
Then it flows
through the country.

91
00:06:13,121 --> 00:06:14,521
So, why go
all the way to Varanasi?

92
00:06:14,681 --> 00:06:16,521
But sir, that's where
you get salvation.

93
00:06:18,481 --> 00:06:20,481
You could achieve
salvation anywhere.

94
00:06:20,721 --> 00:06:22,001
It's a matter of faith.

95
00:06:22,881 --> 00:06:23,961
Do you have faith?

96
00:06:25,841 --> 00:06:29,441
Anyway, why do you have to go?

97
00:06:29,921 --> 00:06:31,081
Sir, who else will go?

98
00:06:35,881 --> 00:06:36,921
What about your work?

99
00:06:37,561 --> 00:06:39,001
Sir, I will manage.

100
00:06:41,761 --> 00:06:42,881
Don't forget your targets.

101
00:06:43,321 --> 00:06:44,361
Absolutely.

102
00:06:45,401 --> 00:06:46,681
- Greetings!
- Bless you.

103
00:06:46,761 --> 00:06:48,001
- Everything's good?
- What..

104
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,241
Yes.

105
00:06:50,601 --> 00:06:53,001
- Greetings!
- God bless you, dear..

106
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:55,921
You seem very busy these days.

107
00:06:56,161 --> 00:06:58,561
No, Aunt.
It's just the usual routine.

108
00:07:00,601 --> 00:07:02,441
Here comes the cake!

109
00:07:03,241 --> 00:07:04,297
- Let's cut the cake.
- Here you go.

110
00:07:04,321 --> 00:07:05,721
- Go on, cut it.
- Cut it..

111
00:07:05,841 --> 00:07:07,097
- Shouldn't we sing something?
- That..

112
00:07:07,121 --> 00:07:08,601
Let's clap, at least.

113
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:13,441
Why aren't you clapping?

114
00:07:14,361 --> 00:07:15,641
Why the sad face?

115
00:07:16,681 --> 00:07:18,001
Did somebody beat you up?

116
00:07:18,241 --> 00:07:20,561
- Something like that.
- Is it?

117
00:07:23,961 --> 00:07:25,961
- Look at him eyeing the cake.
- Here have it.

118
00:07:31,521 --> 00:07:32,841
That's enough.

119
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:36,881
Here.. I'm here. Give me some!

120
00:07:40,241 --> 00:07:42,841
Here, ma'am, have some more.

121
00:07:46,481 --> 00:07:49,761
Rajiv.
- Give him some. He'll say something sweet for a change.

122
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:52,921
- Here..
- That's fine.

123
00:07:59,401 --> 00:08:01,337
- Aunt, why don't you talk some sense into him?
- Aunt, why don't you talk some sense into him?

124
00:08:01,361 --> 00:08:02,721
What's the point?

125
00:08:03,521 --> 00:08:06,361
He is so stubborn.

126
00:08:06,641 --> 00:08:09,361
You're right,
but at least try once.

127
00:08:09,721 --> 00:08:13,401
- That's all we can do. But he won't listen.
- You came..

128
00:08:13,521 --> 00:08:15,641
- So glad you could come.
- Yes..

129
00:08:20,761 --> 00:08:21,841
Well..

130
00:08:24,721 --> 00:08:28,521
You could have waited
till Sunita's wedding.

131
00:08:31,721 --> 00:08:35,281
Forgive me for anything wrong
I may have said or done. Okay?

132
00:08:39,761 --> 00:08:41,921
Don't cry.. Come.

133
00:08:55,641 --> 00:08:57,841
So, let's start
from the beginning.

134
00:08:58,241 --> 00:08:59,401
Three shirts..

135
00:08:59,481 --> 00:09:02,497
- Leave this one out. It's not so nice.
- Leave this one out. It's not so nice.

136
00:09:02,521 --> 00:09:03,881
Why aren't you
keeping more books?

137
00:09:04,121 --> 00:09:05,121
Here they are.

138
00:09:05,561 --> 00:09:06,721
Put a few more.

139
00:09:07,001 --> 00:09:08,041
Aren't these enough?

140
00:09:08,921 --> 00:09:10,041
They aren't enough!

141
00:09:16,241 --> 00:09:18,161
The taxi will be
here by 7 a.m. tomorrow.

142
00:09:20,201 --> 00:09:22,121
We'll be done packing by then.

143
00:09:24,161 --> 00:09:25,161
Dad?

144
00:09:26,001 --> 00:09:28,321
If we could stay
a few more days..

145
00:09:28,681 --> 00:09:29,681
Why?

146
00:09:30,961 --> 00:09:35,081
There's a lot of work
at the office right now.

147
00:09:37,281 --> 00:09:38,401
What do you have to do?

148
00:09:38,561 --> 00:09:40,081
I just have to sit
in the car and go.

149
00:09:40,441 --> 00:09:43,161
Just find me a taxi and I'll go.

150
00:09:44,241 --> 00:09:45,841
You can at least manage that,
right?

151
00:09:55,521 --> 00:09:56,561
Should I come?

152
00:09:57,441 --> 00:09:58,841
No, it's fine..

153
00:10:05,441 --> 00:10:07,521
- Have you seen this?
- What is it?

154
00:10:09,481 --> 00:10:10,841
It's your grandmother's.

155
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:13,361
Wear it on your wedding day.
Okay?

156
00:10:17,081 --> 00:10:18,361
I am going to wear it now.

157
00:10:24,641 --> 00:10:25,641
How does it look?

158
00:10:34,161 --> 00:10:37,321
- Will you come?
- Where?

159
00:10:38,001 --> 00:10:39,001
Varanasi? Or..

160
00:10:40,441 --> 00:10:42,441
Varanasi. To the riverside.

161
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:50,081
Here you go.

162
00:10:51,281 --> 00:10:53,441
From now on, this TV is yours.

163
00:10:55,681 --> 00:10:57,481
This is exactly why
I won't stop you.

164
00:10:59,401 --> 00:11:02,137
- How can he possibly know his time is up?
- How can he possibly know his time is up?

165
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,161
I don't know.

166
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:05,881
Maybe it's one of those
things you just know.

167
00:11:06,521 --> 00:11:08,961
Grandfather was in perfect shape

168
00:11:09,401 --> 00:11:11,441
but within 10 days
of getting there, he passed away.

169
00:11:14,761 --> 00:11:15,801
What?

170
00:11:18,681 --> 00:11:20,761
- Died.
- Oh.

171
00:11:26,921 --> 00:11:29,361
So, it'll take 10 days?

172
00:11:30,681 --> 00:11:31,681
How would I know?

173
00:11:33,841 --> 00:11:34,841
You just said..

174
00:11:35,481 --> 00:11:37,401
I was talking about grandfather.

175
00:11:37,641 --> 00:11:38,841
How would I know about dad?

176
00:11:42,961 --> 00:11:44,001
So, how long will it take?

177
00:11:48,761 --> 00:11:51,961
I'm just asking.
Why are you getting upset?

178
00:11:52,401 --> 00:11:53,921
So, think before you ask.

179
00:11:56,001 --> 00:11:57,681
When will he die..

180
00:11:58,041 --> 00:11:59,721
What?
You want me to strangle him?

181
00:12:03,761 --> 00:12:05,881
- Is that what I said?
- Then what should I do?

182
00:12:06,561 --> 00:12:07,561
What else I can do?

183
00:12:11,161 --> 00:12:12,161
Are you hungry?

184
00:12:18,401 --> 00:12:19,401
No.

185
00:12:20,961 --> 00:12:24,161
You're asking me as if
I have the death's list with me.

186
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:29,961
Leave the ATM card
before you go.

187
00:12:33,241 --> 00:12:35,481
This is just an excuse
to go on a vacation.

188
00:12:36,241 --> 00:12:37,241
Hey..

189
00:12:56,641 --> 00:12:57,641
Hello.

190
00:12:58,281 --> 00:12:59,421
Hello, sir.. Sir..

191
00:12:59,422 --> 00:13:00,561
Hello, sir.. Sir..

192
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:11,361
Can't you drive a little faster?

193
00:13:12,601 --> 00:13:13,601
What are you doing?

194
00:13:17,001 --> 00:13:19,841
Take it easy.. Go slow.

195
00:13:21,441 --> 00:13:23,321
Don't send me up
before we get there.

196
00:14:43,561 --> 00:14:47,761
'Varanasi. 120.'

197
00:15:05,761 --> 00:15:09,561
The name of Ram is the truth..

198
00:15:42,081 --> 00:15:43,561
Keep going. Dad, hold tight.

199
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:49,121
Dad..

200
00:16:12,081 --> 00:16:14,961
Hail Mother Ganges!

201
00:16:30,161 --> 00:16:32,321
'Salvation Homestead.
Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh.'

202
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:47,041
Dad, please let's go back home.

203
00:16:48,281 --> 00:16:49,297
What are you saying? Come on..

204
00:16:49,321 --> 00:16:50,417
No, please let's go back home.

205
00:16:50,441 --> 00:16:51,561
Come, let's go inside!

206
00:17:17,641 --> 00:17:19,841
Which way is the office?

207
00:17:28,161 --> 00:17:31,241
Mr. Mishra, nothing has
changed here over the years.

208
00:17:31,521 --> 00:17:33,401
Even the wall clock is same.

209
00:17:34,441 --> 00:17:37,601
If I, too, change with time,
then what else would be left?

210
00:17:38,601 --> 00:17:40,561
Age?
- 76.

211
00:17:41,481 --> 00:17:44,241
- Yours?
- No, his.

212
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:45,961
So, then let him speak.

213
00:17:46,521 --> 00:17:47,721
77.

214
00:17:49,281 --> 00:17:50,281
By the way

215
00:17:50,441 --> 00:17:53,081
what makes you think
that your time has come?

216
00:17:55,281 --> 00:17:59,121
I keep having the same dream.

217
00:18:00,001 --> 00:18:01,361
Oh, dreams!

218
00:18:01,641 --> 00:18:04,681
Dream is the eye of your
inner consciousness.

219
00:18:07,681 --> 00:18:08,841
Do you have tuberculosis?

220
00:18:09,161 --> 00:18:10,161
No.

221
00:18:10,601 --> 00:18:11,921
Do you eat meat?

222
00:18:12,281 --> 00:18:14,481
No, never.

223
00:18:16,121 --> 00:18:17,121
Now, look.

224
00:18:17,761 --> 00:18:18,921
Why do people come here?

225
00:18:19,721 --> 00:18:21,161
In search of salvation.

226
00:18:21,441 --> 00:18:22,961
It's all a matter of faith.

227
00:18:23,281 --> 00:18:24,361
What is salvation?

228
00:18:25,401 --> 00:18:26,521
Hey. Get out of here.

229
00:18:28,121 --> 00:18:30,441
As I was saying,
what is salvation?

230
00:18:30,961 --> 00:18:34,401
The soul thinks that it's a wave.

231
00:18:34,841 --> 00:18:37,721
But suddenly, it's set free
and realizes

232
00:18:37,801 --> 00:18:39,081
that it's not just a wave.

233
00:18:39,441 --> 00:18:40,681
It's the ocean.

234
00:18:41,841 --> 00:18:43,201
This is salvation.

235
00:18:45,001 --> 00:18:46,041
Didn't you get it?

236
00:18:47,121 --> 00:18:48,881
I wasn't lying to you earlier

237
00:18:49,201 --> 00:18:50,521
that everything is occupied here.

238
00:18:50,641 --> 00:18:51,801
It was occupied.

239
00:18:52,481 --> 00:18:54,961
But just today,
a soul achieved salvation.

240
00:18:58,841 --> 00:18:59,841
Look.

241
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:02,561
Death is a process.

242
00:19:03,161 --> 00:19:07,561
Are you sure, you are
ready to start the process?

243
00:19:09,321 --> 00:19:12,801
Mr. Mishra,
the process has already begun.

244
00:19:20,801 --> 00:19:21,841
Let's go.

245
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:23,721
There are 14 rooms here.

246
00:19:23,801 --> 00:19:25,721
You must clean your own room.

247
00:19:25,801 --> 00:19:28,681
Satguru can also do it
but you'll have to pay him extra.

248
00:19:28,801 --> 00:19:30,361
Your health is in
your own hands.

249
00:19:30,641 --> 00:19:33,441
We don't have any
medical facilities here.

250
00:19:33,721 --> 00:19:35,681
You must cook your own food.

251
00:19:36,641 --> 00:19:38,881
Consumption of meat is prohibited.

252
00:19:40,801 --> 00:19:42,001
Do you consume alcohol?

253
00:19:43,001 --> 00:19:44,801
- Do you?
- No.

254
00:19:45,481 --> 00:19:47,001
Marijuana, hashish, opium?

255
00:19:47,201 --> 00:19:49,361
- No.
- You must try it!

256
00:19:49,481 --> 00:19:51,201
You can ask someone
in the back alley.

257
00:19:52,561 --> 00:19:54,241
Please don't pay any
money to priests here.

258
00:19:54,681 --> 00:19:56,321
You have sinned all your life

259
00:19:56,401 --> 00:19:58,281
and in your dying
moments you pay the priest

260
00:19:58,481 --> 00:19:59,761
to forgive your sins.

261
00:19:59,841 --> 00:20:03,281
- Doesn't work like that, does it? Come on.
- Doesn't work like that, does it? Come on.

262
00:20:03,961 --> 00:20:05,401
This is the prayer room.

263
00:20:06,921 --> 00:20:08,641
Why are you guys mumbling?

264
00:20:08,921 --> 00:20:12,481
Sing loudly. Come on!

265
00:20:14,761 --> 00:20:17,521
We are lucky to be right on
the banks of the river Ganges.

266
00:20:17,601 --> 00:20:19,921
If you ever need
the holy Ganges water

267
00:20:20,121 --> 00:20:22,441
feel free to fetch it from the
river or my office upstairs.

268
00:20:24,481 --> 00:20:26,721
There is a marriage hall
and a dairy next door.

269
00:20:27,001 --> 00:20:28,401
The name is Salvation Homestead.

270
00:20:28,641 --> 00:20:31,001
But we don't let out rooms
till you receive salvation.

271
00:20:31,241 --> 00:20:33,481
The room is available
only for 15 days.

272
00:20:33,721 --> 00:20:35,721
Only for 15 days?
And after that?

273
00:20:35,961 --> 00:20:37,801
After that it's your headache.

274
00:20:37,961 --> 00:20:40,281
If you die then good for you
or else go back home.

275
00:20:40,921 --> 00:20:42,601
So that's good.
We can take the train back.

276
00:20:42,881 --> 00:20:44,601
Is there a booking
agent around here?

277
00:20:45,441 --> 00:20:46,441
Come.

278
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:48,601
Come, inside.

279
00:20:51,761 --> 00:20:55,201
Please maintain silence here.
All right? Come in.

280
00:20:56,881 --> 00:20:57,881
Come in.

281
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:07,561
It's free..

282
00:21:08,081 --> 00:21:09,441
Is there another room?

283
00:21:13,721 --> 00:21:14,721
There is.

284
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:17,841
Step out and turn right then,
take a left.

285
00:21:18,321 --> 00:21:20,081
A little ahead there is
Apsara Lodge.

286
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:21,401
You will find a room there.

287
00:21:21,641 --> 00:21:22,881
For Rs. 500 a day.

288
00:21:25,081 --> 00:21:26,081
This works fine.

289
00:21:28,281 --> 00:21:29,281
Is it okay?

290
00:21:30,001 --> 00:21:33,001
We know people who can help you
with your funeral arrangements.

291
00:21:33,121 --> 00:21:34,681
I will let you know where to go.

292
00:21:35,281 --> 00:21:36,657
I am assuming you have
donated a cow already?

293
00:21:36,681 --> 00:21:37,561
Yes.

294
00:21:37,681 --> 00:21:40,001
Alright then.
Call me if you need anything.

295
00:21:41,681 --> 00:21:43,961
It's free. It's free.

296
00:21:44,481 --> 00:21:45,601
You'll be able to stay here?

297
00:21:47,721 --> 00:21:48,721
Why not?

298
00:21:49,681 --> 00:21:50,841
What's wrong with this place?

299
00:22:20,321 --> 00:22:21,321
Rajiv.

300
00:22:23,201 --> 00:22:24,921
Which way is east?

301
00:22:33,601 --> 00:22:34,601
Facing that way.

302
00:22:45,041 --> 00:22:46,121
I will be back.

303
00:22:46,161 --> 00:22:48,841
"Glory to Sita-Rama!"

304
00:22:48,921 --> 00:22:51,321
"Glory to Sita-Rama!"

305
00:22:51,401 --> 00:22:54,281
"Glory to Sita-Rama!"

306
00:22:54,441 --> 00:22:57,161
"Glory to Sita-Rama!"

307
00:22:57,241 --> 00:22:59,821
"The name of Rama is
the only truth in this world."

308
00:22:59,822 --> 00:23:02,401
"The name of Rama is
the only truth in this world."

309
00:23:02,641 --> 00:23:05,241
"The name of Rama is
the only truth in this world."

310
00:23:05,281 --> 00:23:07,881
"Says Lord Hanuman."

311
00:23:07,961 --> 00:23:10,481
"Glory to Sita-Rama!"

312
00:23:10,561 --> 00:23:13,121
"Glory to Sita-Rama!"

313
00:23:13,321 --> 00:23:18,761
"The name of Rama is
the only truth in this world."

314
00:23:18,801 --> 00:23:21,401
"The name of Rama is
the only truth in this world."

315
00:23:21,481 --> 00:23:24,161
"Says Lord Hanuman."

316
00:23:24,201 --> 00:23:26,521
"Glory to Sita-Rama!"

317
00:23:27,601 --> 00:23:31,121
I'm sorry, I don't know
these hymns so well...

318
00:23:31,361 --> 00:23:33,481
That's okay.
You'll get to know them with time.

319
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:36,401
This is Rajiv, my son.

320
00:23:36,641 --> 00:23:38,001
Meet Vimla.

321
00:23:38,401 --> 00:23:39,441
Pay your respects.

322
00:23:40,481 --> 00:23:42,081
Hello. Bless you.

323
00:23:42,201 --> 00:23:43,641
You must be as old as my son,
Ravi.

324
00:23:45,361 --> 00:23:47,441
- Flying Saucer?
- Sorry?

325
00:23:47,841 --> 00:23:49,721
- Do you watch it?
- No.

326
00:23:50,321 --> 00:23:51,361
Then what do you watch?

327
00:23:52,641 --> 00:23:54,081
No, I don't watch TV.

328
00:23:54,361 --> 00:23:55,761
He does.

329
00:23:56,041 --> 00:23:57,041
You do?

330
00:23:57,081 --> 00:23:58,417
- You must be following Flying Saucer then?
- Yes..

331
00:23:58,441 --> 00:24:00,697
- So, why don't you join us in the TV room then? - No..
- So, why don't you join us in the TV room then? - No..

332
00:24:00,721 --> 00:24:02,201
It's going to start soon.
Please come.

333
00:24:02,481 --> 00:24:03,841
Dad what do we do about dinner?

334
00:24:04,081 --> 00:24:05,241
Dinner?

335
00:24:05,721 --> 00:24:07,801
I made plenty. Come with me.

336
00:24:07,881 --> 00:24:09,321
No..

337
00:24:09,401 --> 00:24:11,441
- Dad we can manage, right?
- Yes of course..

338
00:24:11,521 --> 00:24:14,241
- Why can't you eat with me?
- No!

339
00:24:14,521 --> 00:24:15,801
- So come!
- Come.

340
00:24:16,681 --> 00:24:19,361
She's insisting, let's go.

341
00:24:22,321 --> 00:24:23,521
Will you have some pickle?

342
00:24:29,041 --> 00:24:30,161
Here you go..

343
00:24:32,281 --> 00:24:34,681
Mice are a big
problem around here.

344
00:24:37,001 --> 00:24:38,761
All this arrangement
for just 15 days?

345
00:24:41,321 --> 00:24:42,801
It's been 18 years.

346
00:24:46,921 --> 00:24:48,081
18 years?

347
00:24:50,361 --> 00:24:52,161
I came here with my husband.

348
00:24:53,921 --> 00:24:56,721
We used to think that we'll
leave this world together.

349
00:24:57,721 --> 00:24:59,241
But he left me behind.

350
00:25:00,961 --> 00:25:02,081
But Mr. Mishra said

351
00:25:02,161 --> 00:25:03,417
that you could stay here
for a maximum of 15 days?

352
00:25:03,441 --> 00:25:04,441
That is the rule.

353
00:25:05,681 --> 00:25:10,241
That indeed is the rule.
These days, my name is Surabhi.

354
00:25:11,401 --> 00:25:12,401
What do you mean?

355
00:25:13,961 --> 00:25:15,001
Does the food taste fine?

356
00:25:15,401 --> 00:25:19,001
- The food is delicious..
- Okay..

357
00:25:20,121 --> 00:25:22,041
It must be hard living
all by yourself?

358
00:25:23,521 --> 00:25:24,801
At first, I didn't like it

359
00:25:26,281 --> 00:25:27,681
but now I have learnt to let go.

360
00:25:28,441 --> 00:25:31,521
So, it's all good.
Now, I'm just waiting.

361
00:25:34,081 --> 00:25:36,241
The food is delicious.
Thank you!

362
00:25:37,121 --> 00:25:40,281
People nowadays say
thank you too often.

363
00:25:40,561 --> 00:25:41,881
Thankful for everything,
it seems.

364
00:25:42,761 --> 00:25:44,601
- I am sorry.
- And sorry, too.

365
00:25:48,041 --> 00:25:49,401
You both must be tired.

366
00:25:49,521 --> 00:25:50,561
- No..
- Yes.

367
00:25:52,761 --> 00:25:57,481
'Sir, look up!
Open your eyes, sir.'

368
00:25:57,721 --> 00:25:59,081
'I am back.'

369
00:26:00,281 --> 00:26:02,121
He is so much fun.

370
00:26:05,241 --> 00:26:08,881
Please forgive me.
I know that you would come back.

371
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:29,921
Rajiv.

372
00:26:31,121 --> 00:26:32,601
- Rajiv.
- Yes, Dad?

373
00:26:33,921 --> 00:26:35,441
Water..

374
00:26:38,921 --> 00:26:40,041
I'll have to go and get it.

375
00:27:27,601 --> 00:27:28,601
What are you looking for?

376
00:27:32,081 --> 00:27:34,121
We were out of water, so..

377
00:27:34,841 --> 00:27:36,641
It's there in my office,
next to the table.

378
00:27:38,241 --> 00:27:39,241
Right.

379
00:27:41,961 --> 00:27:42,961
Mr. Mishra.

380
00:27:46,441 --> 00:27:48,401
There must be ghosts here, right?

381
00:27:50,321 --> 00:27:52,281
Ghosts? What's that?

382
00:27:52,441 --> 00:27:56,961
Ghosts, spirits, ghouls..

383
00:27:57,561 --> 00:28:00,657
- The souls here reside within the body.
- The souls here reside within the body.

384
00:28:00,681 --> 00:28:01,841
Once it leaves the body

385
00:28:02,241 --> 00:28:04,641
they are free from the circle
of life and death.

386
00:28:05,081 --> 00:28:06,361
What business do they have here?

387
00:28:10,881 --> 00:28:11,881
Listen.

388
00:28:13,081 --> 00:28:14,641
Try relaxing a little.
All right?

389
00:28:26,361 --> 00:28:31,521
The name of Ram is the truth..

390
00:29:51,401 --> 00:29:52,881
Sir, how can I come for a day?

391
00:29:53,001 --> 00:29:54,601
It'll take me a day
to just come and go.

392
00:29:56,481 --> 00:29:58,721
Let me to talk
to the client directly.

393
00:29:59,321 --> 00:30:01,297
- Rajiv! - Don't you worry.
- Rajiv! - Don't you worry.

394
00:30:01,321 --> 00:30:03,001
- Let me worry about the targets.
- Rajiv..

395
00:30:03,321 --> 00:30:04,601
Hold on a minute, sir. Yes, Dad?

396
00:30:05,241 --> 00:30:06,881
Heat some milk for me.

397
00:30:09,001 --> 00:30:10,761
I'll have to go and fetch it.

398
00:30:12,641 --> 00:30:15,201
You know that I need
milk every morning.

399
00:30:16,761 --> 00:30:18,161
Sir, please hold the line.

400
00:30:19,361 --> 00:30:20,881
Can't you do without it today?

401
00:30:21,121 --> 00:30:23,081
Fine, I'll get it myself.

402
00:30:25,241 --> 00:30:27,081
Sir, I will call you later.

403
00:30:28,121 --> 00:30:29,441
I'll go get it.

404
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:31,561
Why couldn't you get it
in the morning?

405
00:30:42,961 --> 00:30:44,281
Excuse me.

406
00:30:45,441 --> 00:30:46,561
Can I get some milk?

407
00:30:46,641 --> 00:30:47,921
Come before 7 a.m.

408
00:30:48,601 --> 00:30:49,481
I only need a little.

409
00:30:49,561 --> 00:30:50,961
Come back in the evening then.

410
00:30:52,481 --> 00:30:53,721
Just a little.

411
00:30:53,961 --> 00:30:55,201
Come in the evening.

412
00:31:04,321 --> 00:31:05,721
I'm there..

413
00:31:07,881 --> 00:31:10,561
Just hear me out..

414
00:31:10,641 --> 00:31:14,281
It's like you're
planting a mango tree.

415
00:31:14,481 --> 00:31:15,937
And your sons and grandsons
will reap the fruits eventually.

416
00:31:15,961 --> 00:31:17,001
That's all.

417
00:31:17,081 --> 00:31:18,641
- Sir, do you understand?
- Rajiv?

418
00:31:18,881 --> 00:31:20,321
- Dad..
- You call this food?

419
00:31:20,361 --> 00:31:22,201
Sir, just listen to me..

420
00:31:22,281 --> 00:31:23,721
You are like my family.

421
00:31:23,841 --> 00:31:25,321
- The moment I come back..
- Rajiv!

422
00:31:25,401 --> 00:31:27,401
- Rajiv this is tasteless.
- I'm on the phone, Dad!

423
00:31:27,481 --> 00:31:29,721
You're on the phone all the time.
Even when we eat!

424
00:31:29,801 --> 00:31:30,681
So, what's the matter? Eat it!

425
00:31:30,761 --> 00:31:32,481
Sir, hold on a minute.

426
00:31:32,561 --> 00:31:33,721
Please eat.

427
00:31:33,801 --> 00:31:35,241
If you want to feed me
food like this

428
00:31:35,321 --> 00:31:37,121
I'll make it myself.

429
00:31:37,681 --> 00:31:38,921
I won't eat this.

430
00:31:38,961 --> 00:31:40,201
You call this food?

431
00:31:41,921 --> 00:31:45,961
- You have it!
- Sir, let me call you back.

432
00:31:56,641 --> 00:32:00,401
- 'Where did you leave us and go, Amit Mishra?'
- 'Where did you leave us and go, Amit Mishra?'

433
00:32:00,881 --> 00:32:02,841
'You left us on 3rd March.'

434
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,641
'You could have stayed back
for a few days.'

435
00:32:04,841 --> 00:32:08,961
'On 13th, you should've eaten your
grandson's birthday cake and left.'

436
00:32:09,161 --> 00:32:11,961
'Your grandson keeps calling you
and saying'

437
00:32:12,081 --> 00:32:13,641
'Grandpa, come back.'

438
00:32:13,721 --> 00:32:17,441
'Otherwise I won't
cut the cake.'

439
00:32:19,481 --> 00:32:20,681
What kind of language is this?

440
00:32:20,761 --> 00:32:22,537
If he was my student,
I would have failed him.

441
00:32:22,561 --> 00:32:23,921
This is how they write these days.

442
00:32:24,081 --> 00:32:25,801
The newspaper guys have
pre-made templates.

443
00:32:25,961 --> 00:32:27,961
They just change the name
and print it.

444
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:30,161
They have ruined the language.

445
00:32:30,241 --> 00:32:33,081
- I will write my own obituary.
- Write mine, as well.

446
00:32:33,161 --> 00:32:35,401
- Dad, come on, it's time for your medicines.
- Tell me..

447
00:32:36,041 --> 00:32:37,897
- I don't want any medicines!
- So, you have met the host?

448
00:32:37,921 --> 00:32:40,441
- Why are you sitting out in the sun?
- I'll come later.

449
00:32:40,481 --> 00:32:43,001
Take my advice,
get your obituary written.

450
00:32:43,441 --> 00:32:45,641
- Why?
- Because he is doing it for free!

451
00:32:52,801 --> 00:32:54,081
Lie down now.

452
00:33:02,041 --> 00:33:03,601
I am going out to get some food.

453
00:33:03,681 --> 00:33:05,441
Get some fruits.

454
00:33:06,961 --> 00:33:07,961
What?

455
00:33:08,481 --> 00:33:11,321
I think I'll follow the hermit's
diet from now on.

456
00:33:14,041 --> 00:33:17,201
Millionaires eat fruits.
Not hermits.

457
00:33:38,601 --> 00:33:40,121
I wasn't lying to you earlier

458
00:33:40,401 --> 00:33:41,721
that everything is occupied here.

459
00:33:41,961 --> 00:33:43,081
It was occupied.

460
00:33:43,161 --> 00:33:45,921
But just today,
a soul achieved salvation.

461
00:33:47,201 --> 00:33:49,241
Death is a process.

462
00:33:49,441 --> 00:33:51,961
Are you sure, you are ready
to start the process?

463
00:33:52,881 --> 00:33:54,841
Alright then.
I will need your thumbprint here.

464
00:33:55,041 --> 00:33:56,241
Satguru!

465
00:33:56,321 --> 00:33:58,241
- Yes!
- Come over here.

466
00:34:00,721 --> 00:34:02,801
Put them up in room number 12.

467
00:34:04,321 --> 00:34:05,361
Let's go.

468
00:34:08,401 --> 00:34:09,801
Thank you so much.

469
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,961
Don't thank him just yet.
It'll take a while.

470
00:34:12,801 --> 00:34:14,641
Why? Why will it take a while?

471
00:34:15,321 --> 00:34:17,921
Don't worry. He'll go soon.

472
00:34:18,881 --> 00:34:21,641
Mr. Mishra, how do you know
who will die and when?

473
00:34:23,481 --> 00:34:25,201
I don't know.

474
00:34:25,601 --> 00:34:27,721
But I can sense it.

475
00:34:28,081 --> 00:34:29,121
Really?

476
00:34:29,601 --> 00:34:32,161
But your records tell otherwise.

477
00:34:33,721 --> 00:34:38,241
Listen, don't mistake my
generosity for foolishness.

478
00:34:38,481 --> 00:34:39,777
Then why don't you tell me
about my dad?

479
00:34:39,801 --> 00:34:41,361
- That, I can't do.
- Why not?

480
00:34:42,321 --> 00:34:43,681
- If I tell you..
- Yes.

481
00:34:43,841 --> 00:34:46,041
My powers will be snatched from me.

482
00:34:46,721 --> 00:34:47,921
Who said so?

483
00:34:48,041 --> 00:34:49,921
- I just know.
- Why don't you tell me?

484
00:34:50,321 --> 00:34:52,201
No! Absolutely not!

485
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:55,041
I said no!

486
00:34:58,161 --> 00:35:02,161
- He doesn't know anything. Keeps talking rubbish.
- He doesn't know anything. Keeps talking rubbish.

487
00:35:25,001 --> 00:35:28,881
The name of Rama is the truth..

488
00:35:29,281 --> 00:35:34,401
The name of Rama is the truth..

489
00:35:34,681 --> 00:35:39,841
The name of Rama is the truth..

490
00:35:42,361 --> 00:35:43,721
He was a good man.

491
00:36:14,001 --> 00:36:16,441
It's been 18 years
since I came here.

492
00:36:17,521 --> 00:36:18,681
Yes.

493
00:36:19,001 --> 00:36:20,401
You told me.

494
00:36:20,721 --> 00:36:22,321
I forget a lot.

495
00:36:24,521 --> 00:36:27,321
At this age, even I tend to forget.

496
00:36:29,561 --> 00:36:32,321
Rajiv gets so annoyed with me.

497
00:36:32,401 --> 00:36:35,361
Why do you keep repeating
the same things again and again..

498
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:45,721
My son, Ravi, works a lot, too.

499
00:36:46,521 --> 00:36:50,721
He only calls me while he eats.

500
00:36:52,041 --> 00:36:54,881
I keep trying to tell him
not to talk while eating.

501
00:36:55,601 --> 00:36:57,481
Then he says,
'Mom, when shall I call you then?'

502
00:36:59,841 --> 00:37:01,737
- This is how it is now.
- This is how it is now.

503
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:03,721
Rajiv is no different.

504
00:37:03,761 --> 00:37:06,761
Holding the phone in one hand
and the spoon in the other.

505
00:37:06,961 --> 00:37:08,721
It really bothers me.

506
00:37:13,801 --> 00:37:16,241
- Come on now.
- I am a little scared of water.

507
00:37:16,321 --> 00:37:18,801
Come on, we've reached already.

508
00:37:19,361 --> 00:37:20,521
Come on.

509
00:37:23,361 --> 00:37:24,961
Here, give me your hand.

510
00:37:27,521 --> 00:37:30,561
Here, mister. - Please, let me pay for this.
- Doesn't matter at all.

511
00:37:30,681 --> 00:37:32,321
Come..

512
00:37:49,401 --> 00:37:51,041
Why did you stop writing?

513
00:37:53,961 --> 00:37:57,201
All those stories
you used to write?

514
00:37:59,041 --> 00:38:00,241
- Poems.
- Poems.

515
00:38:00,761 --> 00:38:05,881
Oh, yes. I remember one about
the old woman sitting on the moon.

516
00:38:09,281 --> 00:38:10,721
You still remember that?

517
00:38:11,641 --> 00:38:12,761
Of course.

518
00:38:12,921 --> 00:38:15,481
I even shared it
with my colleagues.

519
00:38:18,161 --> 00:38:19,921
Your cane made me
leave all of that.

520
00:38:21,401 --> 00:38:22,681
My cane?

521
00:38:23,681 --> 00:38:25,601
It didn't matter who did what
in the whole class.

522
00:38:26,081 --> 00:38:28,561
It was always the teacher's son
who was at fault.

523
00:38:35,681 --> 00:38:38,641
I only wanted
the best for you all.

524
00:38:39,641 --> 00:38:42,801
And you were no different
for me than the others.

525
00:38:44,281 --> 00:38:45,681
I know.

526
00:38:53,561 --> 00:38:57,161
It's very easy to blame others
for your failures.

527
00:38:58,521 --> 00:39:00,361
- I am doing just fine.
- I am doing just fine.

528
00:39:01,961 --> 00:39:05,161
But you please continue writing
the obituaries.

529
00:39:42,081 --> 00:39:43,561
I'll get the doctor.

530
00:39:47,041 --> 00:39:48,401
Listen..

531
00:39:50,361 --> 00:39:51,881
Don't get the doctor.

532
00:39:51,961 --> 00:39:53,241
We need to call a doctor.

533
00:39:53,321 --> 00:39:54,561
No.

534
00:39:54,641 --> 00:39:56,681
Get me holy water.

535
00:39:57,201 --> 00:39:58,721
- Holy water?
- Yes.

536
00:39:59,841 --> 00:40:01,081
- Dad?
- Dad?

537
00:40:01,601 --> 00:40:03,121
Time has come.

538
00:40:04,801 --> 00:40:06,201
Get me holy water.

539
00:40:08,201 --> 00:40:09,721
Start preparing.

540
00:40:51,881 --> 00:40:53,041
Yes, tell me.

541
00:41:11,961 --> 00:41:13,361
Will you eat anything?

542
00:41:14,201 --> 00:41:17,761
I think both of you
should come soon. Yes.

543
00:41:18,961 --> 00:41:22,961
As soon as you can.

544
00:41:24,481 --> 00:41:25,801
Hold on. Mr. Mishra.

545
00:41:27,321 --> 00:41:28,681
Wait.

546
00:41:32,921 --> 00:41:36,241
You had mentioned something
about funeral arrangements.

547
00:42:43,681 --> 00:42:47,761
The name of Rama is the truth.

548
00:43:09,321 --> 00:43:11,841
I have got the best
quality wood for you.

549
00:43:12,321 --> 00:43:15,961
- What..
- How does it matter?

550
00:43:16,721 --> 00:43:17,881
You are very fortunate.

551
00:43:17,961 --> 00:43:19,761
Your son is here with you.

552
00:43:22,081 --> 00:43:23,721
That is true..

553
00:43:23,801 --> 00:43:26,361
It's been said that when
an elephant's time is near

554
00:43:26,841 --> 00:43:29,041
he leaves everyone
and goes to die alone.

555
00:43:29,401 --> 00:43:30,881
Enough now.

556
00:43:35,561 --> 00:43:36,881
Shall we begin?

557
00:43:39,241 --> 00:43:45,641
"The tattered cover of life.."

558
00:43:45,721 --> 00:43:51,521
"The tattered cover of life.."

559
00:43:51,561 --> 00:43:57,721
"All the bonds would be
left behind.."

560
00:43:57,881 --> 00:43:59,081
"The tattered cover of life.."

561
00:44:03,481 --> 00:44:04,481
What is he saying?

562
00:44:04,641 --> 00:44:07,161
He's requesting you
to sing in tune please.

563
00:44:07,241 --> 00:44:08,401
Okay..

564
00:44:08,641 --> 00:44:14,441
"The tattered cover of life.."

565
00:44:18,081 --> 00:44:19,081
Dad..

566
00:44:26,281 --> 00:44:27,601
Yes, Dad?

567
00:44:28,961 --> 00:44:30,921
Water.

568
00:44:32,121 --> 00:44:33,281
Water.

569
00:44:33,961 --> 00:44:35,441
Have some water, Dad.

570
00:44:47,921 --> 00:44:49,641
- Rajiv.
- Yes, Dad.

571
00:44:50,441 --> 00:44:53,961
You used to write

572
00:44:54,041 --> 00:44:56,601
such innocent poetry.

573
00:44:59,241 --> 00:45:00,261
I never let you bloom.

574
00:45:00,262 --> 00:45:01,281
I never let you bloom.

575
00:45:01,761 --> 00:45:04,281
What are you saying, Dad?
Calm down.

576
00:45:05,681 --> 00:45:10,801
Calm down, Dad..

577
00:45:11,201 --> 00:45:13,841
- Calm down.
- Forgive me, my son.

578
00:45:33,721 --> 00:45:36,001
I should be apologising.

579
00:45:37,041 --> 00:45:39,161
Please forgive me, son.

580
00:45:41,361 --> 00:45:43,921
You've been such a good son.

581
00:45:45,801 --> 00:45:47,641
And I've been a terrible father.

582
00:45:47,721 --> 00:45:48,961
No, please don't say that.

583
00:45:50,881 --> 00:45:52,561
Forgive me, son.

584
00:45:52,961 --> 00:45:54,761
Quiet now..

585
00:45:55,761 --> 00:45:57,801
Relax now.

586
00:46:06,161 --> 00:46:08,681
Calm down..

587
00:47:02,041 --> 00:47:03,441
How are you feeling now?

588
00:47:04,641 --> 00:47:05,801
How are you feeling?

589
00:47:09,561 --> 00:47:11,041
Fit.

590
00:47:13,361 --> 00:47:14,641
Rajiv.

591
00:47:19,041 --> 00:47:20,481
Yes, Dad?

592
00:47:22,561 --> 00:47:24,881
Flying saucer.

593
00:47:32,881 --> 00:47:36,081
'Leave from here
and never return.'

594
00:47:36,721 --> 00:47:41,481
'We treated you as our own
and you betrayed us!'

595
00:47:43,961 --> 00:47:47,521
'Don't do this.
Don't say like this..'

596
00:47:48,881 --> 00:47:51,321
'Silence!'

597
00:47:51,481 --> 00:47:56,601
'Sir, you want me to leave from
here, right? I'll do that.'

598
00:47:58,761 --> 00:48:00,857
- How much more is left Mr. Daya?
- How much more is left Mr. Daya?

599
00:48:00,881 --> 00:48:02,081
10 more minutes.

600
00:48:02,801 --> 00:48:05,961
You know, his elder brother
ran away, so..

601
00:48:11,041 --> 00:48:12,481
Naughty girl.

602
00:48:14,881 --> 00:48:16,921
You tricked me?

603
00:48:18,041 --> 00:48:19,801
You didn't recognise my voice?

604
00:48:20,961 --> 00:48:22,841
Gulabi makes really good tea.

605
00:48:27,401 --> 00:48:29,321
- Hey!
- Ask her to make it then.

606
00:48:33,441 --> 00:48:35,241
You have never said
anything about my tea.

607
00:48:36,041 --> 00:48:38,241
But when have I ever said
that you make bad tea?

608
00:48:38,601 --> 00:48:40,241
You have never praised it either.

609
00:48:40,361 --> 00:48:41,841
But why do I need to say it?

610
00:48:42,961 --> 00:48:44,161
Here.

611
00:49:02,881 --> 00:49:04,641
Now it feels like home.

612
00:49:13,561 --> 00:49:14,881
It's been 12 days.

613
00:49:16,721 --> 00:49:19,041
I heard that they let you stay here
for more than 15 days.

614
00:49:22,321 --> 00:49:23,561
Come back home.

615
00:49:24,521 --> 00:49:25,721
And leave him behind?

616
00:49:25,961 --> 00:49:27,441
How long will you stay here?

617
00:49:28,161 --> 00:49:29,361
He seems fine now.

618
00:49:30,121 --> 00:49:31,561
Are you disappointed?

619
00:49:45,601 --> 00:49:47,161
Has he started dreaming again?

620
00:49:47,721 --> 00:49:49,041
I haven't asked.

621
00:49:51,921 --> 00:49:53,441
Let's take him back with us, too.

622
00:49:54,401 --> 00:49:56,521
We'll bring him back here
if he starts dreaming again.

623
00:49:56,561 --> 00:49:57,641
Is it?

624
00:49:58,481 --> 00:50:00,801
- As if he will listen to me.
- As if he will listen to me.

625
00:50:01,401 --> 00:50:02,881
Why would we be here then?

626
00:50:03,481 --> 00:50:05,041
Who wouldn't fall sick here?

627
00:50:05,121 --> 00:50:06,241
Exactly.

628
00:50:06,361 --> 00:50:07,961
It's a circus back at home.

629
00:50:09,041 --> 00:50:10,321
Mom kept yelling at me.

630
00:50:10,401 --> 00:50:12,561
'Sunita, did you take
the forms or not?'

631
00:50:13,721 --> 00:50:15,001
Now fill it quickly.

632
00:50:15,081 --> 00:50:16,441
That's exactly what I am doing.

633
00:50:18,961 --> 00:50:23,681
You can't die until you announce it
by filling a form.

634
00:50:24,881 --> 00:50:26,161
It's amazing.

635
00:50:27,041 --> 00:50:30,121
I always knew,
you were not going to die.

636
00:50:30,881 --> 00:50:32,281
You fell so sick.

637
00:50:32,401 --> 00:50:34,041
Everybody thought
that your time had come.

638
00:50:34,441 --> 00:50:36,081
But you weren't ready, yet.

639
00:50:40,161 --> 00:50:41,201
What?

640
00:50:41,561 --> 00:50:43,681
I am saying that you were
not ready to go.

641
00:50:43,761 --> 00:50:45,041
Let's go home, Grandpa.

642
00:50:47,481 --> 00:50:50,601
Are you sure?
Then your room will be gone.

643
00:50:52,721 --> 00:50:55,241
I'm used to my roommate. I don't
like having the room to myself.

644
00:50:57,841 --> 00:50:59,661
You will be married soon.

645
00:50:59,662 --> 00:51:01,481
You will be married soon.

646
00:51:09,921 --> 00:51:11,241
How many whistles
have been there?

647
00:51:12,401 --> 00:51:13,481
Four.

648
00:51:14,441 --> 00:51:15,801
And chilli?

649
00:51:15,881 --> 00:51:17,417
You have added it now
or will you add it later?

650
00:51:17,441 --> 00:51:19,161
Added it right
in the beginning itself.

651
00:51:21,801 --> 00:51:24,001
Very little coriander, I see.

652
00:51:24,721 --> 00:51:26,881
You have to chafe it
to get the flavour.

653
00:51:28,321 --> 00:51:29,681
Is the food ready?

654
00:51:29,761 --> 00:51:30,961
Yes!

655
00:51:45,481 --> 00:51:47,481
What about your simple diet?

656
00:51:54,641 --> 00:51:57,281
If you started cooking well,
then why would he return home?

657
00:52:00,441 --> 00:52:01,681
Father-in-law.

658
00:52:03,161 --> 00:52:04,561
What should we do
with your scooter?

659
00:52:07,081 --> 00:52:08,481
Give it to her.

660
00:52:09,961 --> 00:52:11,201
She'll ride it.

661
00:52:11,921 --> 00:52:13,401
She'll ride the scooter?

662
00:52:18,561 --> 00:52:19,961
She rides.

663
00:52:26,001 --> 00:52:27,441
She rides the scooter?

664
00:52:30,601 --> 00:52:31,761
Since when?

665
00:52:33,401 --> 00:52:34,881
- Grandpa taught me.
- What?

666
00:52:35,201 --> 00:52:36,801
Grandpa taught me.

667
00:52:38,281 --> 00:52:39,841
She rides well!

668
00:52:47,441 --> 00:52:49,481
Did you inform Vimla?

669
00:52:49,641 --> 00:52:50,841
About what?

670
00:52:51,681 --> 00:52:52,921
Just..

671
00:52:54,761 --> 00:52:56,681
About going shopping tomorrow.

672
00:53:03,721 --> 00:53:04,761
This is quite nice..

673
00:53:04,841 --> 00:53:06,921
It would be a great gift.

674
00:53:07,001 --> 00:53:09,801
Yes. - And this we can take
for her sister-in-law.

675
00:53:09,881 --> 00:53:11,921
You decide please.
I don't have a problem with that.

676
00:53:12,401 --> 00:53:14,321
Dad! Sunita!

677
00:53:15,361 --> 00:53:18,281
Take a look at the dresses.
Dad..

678
00:53:18,441 --> 00:53:19,937
Is he going to make us shop here
for the wedding, too?

679
00:53:19,961 --> 00:53:21,481
Sunita, look at this.

680
00:53:23,561 --> 00:53:26,801
I think, this one will be perfect
for your sister-in-law.

681
00:53:30,161 --> 00:53:32,281
Why do you want to get
high right now?

682
00:53:32,321 --> 00:53:34,241
Mr. Mishra told me that this is..

683
00:53:34,321 --> 00:53:37,721
Here, have it.
- It's one of the famous delicacy of Varanasi.

684
00:53:42,481 --> 00:53:44,001
What if father gets to know
about this?

685
00:53:44,321 --> 00:53:46,881
Then the both of us
will attain salvation.

686
00:53:46,921 --> 00:53:48,441
Go on, drink up.

687
00:55:16,921 --> 00:55:18,801
Look out there!

688
00:55:18,881 --> 00:55:21,561
The prayer ceremonies
are happening over there.

689
00:55:22,001 --> 00:55:23,257
You are just laughing
for no reason.

690
00:55:23,281 --> 00:55:25,121
That's what we are looking at!

691
00:55:27,561 --> 00:55:29,041
She doesn't listen
to anybody anymore.

692
00:55:29,081 --> 00:55:30,441
No need to speak to her.

693
00:55:37,601 --> 00:55:39,241
No, please get back there and sit.

694
00:55:39,361 --> 00:55:40,441
Don't be silly, sit down.

695
00:55:44,521 --> 00:55:45,737
Father-in-law, please sit down.

696
00:55:45,761 --> 00:55:47,841
- Come on stand up.
- Why are you acting so childish?

697
00:55:48,881 --> 00:55:51,801
Sunita! They will fall down.

698
00:55:57,121 --> 00:55:58,701
Hail the Mother Ganges!

699
00:55:58,702 --> 00:56:00,281
Hail the Mother Ganges!

700
00:56:17,881 --> 00:56:19,497
You always have a problem
with something or the other.

701
00:56:19,521 --> 00:56:21,441
- Greetings, Mr. Mishra.
- Greetings.

702
00:56:21,561 --> 00:56:24,081
This is last week's rent.

703
00:56:24,961 --> 00:56:26,921
It's been 15 days now.

704
00:56:27,001 --> 00:56:28,161
We'll vacate tomorrow.

705
00:56:28,241 --> 00:56:29,481
You don't have to.

706
00:56:30,161 --> 00:56:31,081
Sorry?

707
00:56:31,121 --> 00:56:33,921
See, he will leave
when the time comes.

708
00:56:34,121 --> 00:56:35,721
He came with his own free will.

709
00:56:35,801 --> 00:56:38,361
He himself started
the process of death.

710
00:56:38,441 --> 00:56:40,561
Mr. Mishra, it will
get really difficult for me.

711
00:56:40,641 --> 00:56:42,081
Here take your 900 bucks.

712
00:56:42,241 --> 00:56:43,377
What about the remaining
Rs. 100?

713
00:56:43,401 --> 00:56:45,241
What about the days
you disappeared?

714
00:56:46,041 --> 00:56:48,041
You have my mobile number,
don't you?

715
00:56:49,761 --> 00:56:50,881
Yes, of course.

716
00:56:50,961 --> 00:56:52,201
So, we will be in touch then.

717
00:56:52,401 --> 00:56:54,201
Do one thing, give me a name.

718
00:56:54,801 --> 00:56:55,681
Sorry? Whose name?

719
00:56:55,761 --> 00:56:57,321
Any name? Anything would do.

720
00:56:58,161 --> 00:56:59,921
- Natwarlal.
- Natwarlal.

721
00:57:00,241 --> 00:57:01,481
For the next 15 days from now

722
00:57:01,561 --> 00:57:04,281
your father's name will be
Mr. Natwarlal in the registers.

723
00:57:04,361 --> 00:57:07,521
- But Mr. Mishra..
- I said I won't ask him to leave.

724
00:57:11,401 --> 00:57:13,321
You must study hard.

725
00:57:14,361 --> 00:57:15,881
I will come back after the exams.

726
00:57:18,481 --> 00:57:21,721
Always follow your heart.

727
00:57:24,521 --> 00:57:25,721
Bless you.

728
00:57:27,281 --> 00:57:29,521
- Father-in-law.
- Bless you.

729
00:57:31,441 --> 00:57:32,601
Why don't you come home?

730
00:57:33,361 --> 00:57:35,561
You'll get used to it gradually.

731
00:57:42,761 --> 00:57:44,601
Dad, I'll be right back.
Stay here.

732
00:57:50,081 --> 00:57:52,881
Breathe in from one side

733
00:57:53,281 --> 00:57:55,041
and exhale from the other. Yes.

734
00:57:59,961 --> 00:58:02,221
One, two, three, four, five.

735
00:58:02,222 --> 00:58:04,481
One, two, three, four, five.

736
00:58:09,281 --> 00:58:10,921
It helps in reducing stress.

737
00:58:22,321 --> 00:58:25,641
When it's my time to go,
send me off with a celebration.

738
00:58:26,641 --> 00:58:28,441
You or Sunita?

739
00:58:34,961 --> 00:58:36,481
It's a nice family.

740
00:58:38,001 --> 00:58:39,401
Sunita likes the groom?

741
00:58:40,961 --> 00:58:42,121
Why?

742
00:58:42,561 --> 00:58:43,801
No, just..

743
00:58:47,921 --> 00:58:49,841
Has she told you
that she doesn't like him?

744
00:58:51,121 --> 00:58:53,041
No, she didn't say anything

745
00:58:53,121 --> 00:58:54,521
but I have a feeling

746
00:58:54,601 --> 00:58:56,001
that she doesn't like him
that much.

747
00:58:57,081 --> 00:58:58,921
Perhaps, she is doing it
because of you.

748
00:59:00,841 --> 00:59:02,081
Is that what she said?

749
00:59:02,161 --> 00:59:03,801
She didn't say a thing.

750
00:59:04,721 --> 00:59:07,241
But not everything
needs to be said.

751
00:59:12,241 --> 00:59:13,801
Now, what's the solution for this?

752
00:59:18,161 --> 00:59:19,641
I think

753
00:59:20,721 --> 00:59:22,401
she is scared of you.

754
00:59:22,601 --> 00:59:24,241
That's why she doesn't
say anything.

755
00:59:25,521 --> 00:59:26,521
Scared of me? Why?

756
00:59:26,601 --> 00:59:28,481
I have never raised a hand on her.

757
00:59:30,321 --> 00:59:32,881
Is fear only physical?

758
00:59:38,721 --> 00:59:40,721
Please don't put
these ideas in her head.

759
00:59:42,241 --> 00:59:43,521
You think I am doing this?

760
00:59:48,721 --> 00:59:50,881
Did you ever think about me
this much?

761
00:59:55,161 --> 00:59:56,761
And how do you know that?

762
00:59:58,521 --> 00:59:59,961
Did you just magically grow up?

763
01:00:01,121 --> 01:00:02,121
Let it be.

764
01:00:06,521 --> 01:00:08,721
Can I be honest?

765
01:00:09,841 --> 01:00:10,841
Go on.

766
01:00:12,361 --> 01:00:14,921
For a moment I thought
that we will lose you.

767
01:00:17,361 --> 01:00:19,561
Even felt a little jealous.

768
01:00:20,201 --> 01:00:21,121
Jealous?

769
01:00:21,201 --> 01:00:22,801
Yes, I thought

770
01:00:22,881 --> 01:00:26,281
I have been waiting here
for so many years

771
01:00:26,561 --> 01:00:28,481
and you have just arrived here.

772
01:00:31,481 --> 01:00:34,561
I suppose it means

773
01:00:34,641 --> 01:00:36,761
maybe I'd have been luckier then.

774
01:00:38,321 --> 01:00:40,961
You can't just die by trying.

775
01:00:42,481 --> 01:00:45,841
After my husband's death, there
was no one I should return to.

776
01:00:47,521 --> 01:00:49,521
I tried a lot.

777
01:00:50,481 --> 01:00:52,801
I would starve myself for days.

778
01:00:53,561 --> 01:00:55,161
But nothing happened.

779
01:00:56,721 --> 01:00:58,521
And then I understood.

780
01:00:58,841 --> 01:01:02,361
- It doesn't matter what you do or don't do.
- It doesn't matter what you do or don't do.

781
01:01:02,681 --> 01:01:04,321
Death comes on its own will.

782
01:01:28,041 --> 01:01:29,601
Do you want to eat here?

783
01:01:44,561 --> 01:01:46,081
Is everything alright?

784
01:01:50,361 --> 01:01:51,841
A client got away.

785
01:01:53,441 --> 01:01:54,521
It's not a big deal.

786
01:01:55,161 --> 01:01:56,521
You'll get another one.

787
01:02:05,321 --> 01:02:08,361
You need some fresh air.

788
01:02:10,281 --> 01:02:12,761
- Come.
- There's a lot of work to be done.

789
01:02:13,041 --> 01:02:14,041
Come.

790
01:02:33,361 --> 01:02:35,401
It's so peaceful out here.

791
01:02:35,921 --> 01:02:36,921
Isn't it?

792
01:02:38,041 --> 01:02:39,601
Dad tell me something.

793
01:02:40,801 --> 01:02:44,041
What made you think

794
01:02:45,001 --> 01:02:46,921
your time has come?

795
01:02:51,761 --> 01:02:53,281
Just..

796
01:02:54,241 --> 01:02:55,881
I felt like.

797
01:02:57,681 --> 01:02:59,481
I was ready to die.

798
01:03:00,241 --> 01:03:01,321
Why?

799
01:03:02,121 --> 01:03:04,281
Did we not take good care of you?

800
01:03:07,161 --> 01:03:10,001
- No, it's not that.
- Then?

801
01:03:11,241 --> 01:03:12,401
It's just that..

802
01:03:14,521 --> 01:03:16,601
I am tired of this world.

803
01:03:18,321 --> 01:03:22,841
Everything feels like
such an effort.

804
01:03:26,721 --> 01:03:27,841
I am fed up now.

805
01:03:32,801 --> 01:03:36,521
If you had the chance to be

806
01:03:37,841 --> 01:03:39,921
reborn into this family, would you?

807
01:03:47,481 --> 01:03:48,761
No.

808
01:03:48,841 --> 01:03:50,961
Why would I want
to come back as a man?

809
01:03:51,121 --> 01:03:52,161
What does that mean?

810
01:03:52,881 --> 01:03:56,721
I am going to be reborn as a lion.

811
01:03:56,801 --> 01:03:59,761
My mother used to call me
her lion cub.

812
01:04:02,841 --> 01:04:04,761
I'll be a lion.

813
01:04:06,041 --> 01:04:09,241
Or, maybe a kangaroo.

814
01:04:10,801 --> 01:04:13,841
Why? - They have those amazing
pockets!

815
01:04:13,881 --> 01:04:15,441
You can keep anything in it!

816
01:04:15,481 --> 01:04:18,441
Spectacles, pen, children.
Anything.

817
01:04:20,841 --> 01:04:22,401
I'll be a kangaroo.

818
01:04:25,121 --> 01:04:27,441
Everything inside the pocket.

819
01:04:28,481 --> 01:04:31,321
But then you'll have to be born
in Australia.

820
01:04:31,841 --> 01:04:34,441
So, what?
At least I'll have a pocket.

821
01:04:52,681 --> 01:04:53,681
- That's it?
- Enough.

822
01:05:06,201 --> 01:05:07,201
It's good?

823
01:05:18,561 --> 01:05:19,921
- Have some.
- Yes.

824
01:05:28,641 --> 01:05:29,641
Tastes fine.

825
01:05:31,561 --> 01:05:32,921
It's very tasty.

826
01:05:38,641 --> 01:05:39,641
Lata.

827
01:05:41,961 --> 01:05:43,881
What? One minute. Calm down!

828
01:05:45,561 --> 01:05:47,521
Talk slowly. Slowly.

829
01:05:49,201 --> 01:05:50,281
Listen to me..

830
01:05:50,961 --> 01:05:53,881
But how?
I want to speak to her right now.

831
01:05:54,041 --> 01:05:55,841
What do you mean
you won't get married?

832
01:05:56,161 --> 01:05:57,161
Tell me?

833
01:05:57,241 --> 01:06:00,737
- Hello? - Yes, Dad. - She has taken up a job.
- Hello? - Yes, Dad. - She has taken up a job.

834
01:06:00,761 --> 01:06:01,761
What?

835
01:06:01,961 --> 01:06:04,521
- A job.. She has taken up a job.
- Has she lost her mind?

836
01:06:05,241 --> 01:06:07,881
Suddenly?
- Not suddenly, Dad. - So?

837
01:06:08,441 --> 01:06:10,617
- Leave it, what is going wrong with it?
- Signal is weak.

838
01:06:10,641 --> 01:06:13,321
You said you liked him. Why did you
agree in the first place?

839
01:06:13,401 --> 01:06:15,881
- What?
- Why did you agree back then?

840
01:06:16,201 --> 01:06:19,041
He is asking you.
- Is there someone else? - No..

841
01:06:19,201 --> 01:06:22,401
- Hello..
- Hello..

842
01:06:22,521 --> 01:06:24,481
Why can't we see him properly?

843
01:06:24,561 --> 01:06:26,041
The invites have been
printed already.

844
01:06:26,201 --> 01:06:29,121
- He.. The invites have been printed already!
- Hello?

845
01:06:30,521 --> 01:06:34,281
Hello!
- I.. Hello.. I'll earn and return it to you. Sorry..

846
01:06:34,401 --> 01:06:37,841
- What will you do? Hello?
- I'll return the money..

847
01:06:38,601 --> 01:06:40,937
- What will you return?
- She's saying she'll return the money.

848
01:06:40,961 --> 01:06:41,961
What?

849
01:06:42,721 --> 01:06:44,361
You'll return the money?

850
01:06:44,681 --> 01:06:46,017
We'd be a laughing stock
in the whole town.

851
01:06:46,041 --> 01:06:48,121
Nothing will happen.
Dad it doesn't matter to anyone.

852
01:06:48,161 --> 01:06:50,361
- It matters to me.
- Please don't yell. Let it be.

853
01:06:50,441 --> 01:06:52,017
It doesn't matter to you,
it matters to us.

854
01:06:52,041 --> 01:06:54,081
Hello! - Hello!
- Hello? - Hello!

855
01:06:54,161 --> 01:06:57,041
- Listen, you please keep calm.
- Hello..

856
01:06:57,841 --> 01:06:59,641
She's brought shame
to the whole family.

857
01:07:06,321 --> 01:07:09,121
You guys are doing a great job!
How much?

858
01:07:09,281 --> 01:07:11,057
- Should we install a satellite for you?
- How much?

859
01:07:11,081 --> 01:07:13,281
It's Rs. 50. Thank you.

860
01:07:14,001 --> 01:07:17,361
"Glory to Sita-Ram."

861
01:07:17,401 --> 01:07:20,481
"Glory to Sita-Ram."

862
01:07:20,641 --> 01:07:23,881
"Glory to Sita-Ram."

863
01:07:23,961 --> 01:07:26,561
"Glory to Sita-Ram."

864
01:07:29,241 --> 01:07:30,281
Rajiv?

865
01:08:06,561 --> 01:08:07,641
Rajiv?

866
01:08:09,521 --> 01:08:10,601
Rajiv!

867
01:08:12,281 --> 01:08:13,481
Rajiv!

868
01:08:35,481 --> 01:08:38,361
Sir, something came up
so I couldn't return.

869
01:08:38,681 --> 01:08:40,841
I'll come, sir,
very soon I'll return.

870
01:08:40,881 --> 01:08:42,681
Sir, please don't stress..

871
01:08:47,161 --> 01:08:48,721
Sir, why are you shouting?

872
01:08:49,881 --> 01:08:50,881
Sir?

873
01:09:10,241 --> 01:09:14,521
If you leave now, you will never
be able to forgive yourself.

874
01:09:18,241 --> 01:09:19,361
Don't worry.

875
01:09:20,961 --> 01:09:22,961
Your father will be free soon.

876
01:09:32,241 --> 01:09:34,241
Now what will the poor boy do?

877
01:09:38,441 --> 01:09:39,561
Poor boy?

878
01:09:40,721 --> 01:09:41,721
Why?

879
01:09:45,321 --> 01:09:49,321
His daughter will live her life
on his terms or on her own?

880
01:09:52,401 --> 01:09:53,441
Poor!

881
01:09:54,761 --> 01:09:56,481
It's not like that!

882
01:09:58,721 --> 01:10:00,041
Try to talk to him once.

883
01:10:00,042 --> 01:10:01,361
Try to talk to him once.

884
01:10:04,841 --> 01:10:05,881
Nicely.

885
01:10:08,481 --> 01:10:10,361
I don't speak nicely, is it?

886
01:10:11,681 --> 01:10:13,281
He is stubborn.

887
01:10:15,721 --> 01:10:18,801
Okay. Do what you feel is right.

888
01:10:20,161 --> 01:10:22,441
Come on. Go to sleep now.

889
01:10:33,561 --> 01:10:37,401
Sir.. Sir, wake up. Sir, I need the receipt.
- Yes.

890
01:10:40,601 --> 01:10:41,761
Sir, pen..

891
01:10:43,561 --> 01:10:45,881
- What happened?
- Ms. Vimla attained salvation.

892
01:10:48,961 --> 01:10:55,601
"The day your body
is laid in soil."

893
01:10:55,721 --> 01:10:58,861
"Adorned in bright colours."

894
01:10:58,862 --> 01:11:02,001
"Adorned in bright colours."

895
01:11:02,161 --> 01:11:08,361
"Is the day the bird
escapes the cage."

896
01:11:08,481 --> 01:11:14,961
"And flies to freedom."

897
01:11:15,041 --> 01:11:21,681
"Your kin won't be able to help."

898
01:11:21,761 --> 01:11:28,721
"The villagers will be left
behind standing helpless."

899
01:11:28,841 --> 01:11:35,601
"The villagers will be left
behind standing helpless."

900
01:11:35,681 --> 01:11:40,921
"Brothers will have
their hands tied."

901
01:11:41,121 --> 01:11:44,801
"The brothers will have
their hands tied."

902
01:11:44,881 --> 01:11:46,161
Don't be sad.

903
01:11:46,281 --> 01:11:48,001
You should be happy.

904
01:11:48,521 --> 01:11:51,921
Your mother has achieved
salvation in Varanasi.

905
01:11:54,721 --> 01:11:59,441
"Your wealth and possessions,
nothing will follow you."

906
01:11:59,521 --> 01:12:03,041
"The villagers will be left
behind standing helpless."

907
01:12:03,042 --> 01:12:06,561
"The villagers will be left
behind standing helpless."

908
01:12:06,641 --> 01:12:13,401
"The villagers will be left
behind standing helpless."

909
01:12:13,521 --> 01:12:19,361
"Brothers will have
their hands tied."

910
01:12:19,841 --> 01:12:24,641
"Brothers will have
their hands tied."

911
01:12:24,681 --> 01:12:26,841
"The name of Rama is the truth."

912
01:12:27,241 --> 01:12:28,521
'Vimla.'

913
01:12:29,001 --> 01:12:31,321
'Vimla was quiet like the sea.'

914
01:12:33,161 --> 01:12:34,801
'Calm on the surface.'

915
01:12:36,001 --> 01:12:39,361
'Even if a storm simmers beneath.'

916
01:12:41,481 --> 01:12:42,881
'After she left'

917
01:12:43,761 --> 01:12:48,281
'I went to the market
and bought some sweets.'

918
01:12:49,641 --> 01:12:52,121
'And I told the confectioner'

919
01:12:52,881 --> 01:12:55,881
'to give me two glasses of Lassi.'

920
01:12:57,521 --> 01:12:58,881
'Laced with marijuana.'

921
01:13:01,001 --> 01:13:02,801
'One for me'

922
01:13:03,601 --> 01:13:06,161
'and one for Vimla.'

923
01:13:08,321 --> 01:13:10,841
'When I drank both the glasses'

924
01:13:11,481 --> 01:13:13,041
'and went to the river side.'

925
01:13:14,441 --> 01:13:15,761
'I saw'

926
01:13:16,881 --> 01:13:20,201
'that Vimla was flying away.'

927
01:13:21,641 --> 01:13:24,321
'Soaring on top of the Ganges.'

928
01:13:26,641 --> 01:13:28,121
'I asked myself.'

929
01:13:29,641 --> 01:13:31,761
'Am I high?'

930
01:13:32,481 --> 01:13:35,361
'Or is that really you, Vimla?'

931
01:13:37,041 --> 01:13:38,081
'She said'

932
01:13:39,361 --> 01:13:41,401
'Don't call me, Vimla.'

933
01:13:42,961 --> 01:13:44,921
'That was my name'

934
01:13:45,881 --> 01:13:47,441
'when I was trapped like you.'

935
01:13:47,721 --> 01:13:51,361
'Swaying between life and death.'

936
01:13:53,041 --> 01:13:57,441
'Now I am a spirit.'

937
01:13:58,641 --> 01:14:00,121
- 'Free.'
- 'Free.'

938
01:14:01,281 --> 01:14:02,881
'A free spirit.'

939
01:14:04,481 --> 01:14:06,841
'I have no name.'

940
01:14:08,841 --> 01:14:10,681
'Vimla hopes'

941
01:14:11,761 --> 01:14:13,961
'that one day someone'

942
01:14:14,961 --> 01:14:17,601
'will plant a tamarind plant
in her memory.'

943
01:14:19,441 --> 01:14:20,721
'A tamarind..'

944
01:14:22,241 --> 01:14:24,241
'A tamarind plant.'

945
01:16:24,681 --> 01:16:25,721
Dad?

946
01:16:45,401 --> 01:16:48,641
It's time for you to go, Rajiv.

947
01:16:51,161 --> 01:16:52,161
Where?

948
01:16:54,841 --> 01:16:56,161
Where should I go, Dad?

949
01:17:01,041 --> 01:17:02,801
After so many years

950
01:17:03,521 --> 01:17:06,881
you have
started to feel like my own.

951
01:17:07,961 --> 01:17:10,241
You should leave now.

952
01:17:10,321 --> 01:17:13,761
No, Dad. I am not going
anywhere. I'll be here with you.

953
01:17:14,881 --> 01:17:16,361
I won't go.

954
01:17:18,121 --> 01:17:21,321
- Go back now.
- Why don't you come with me, Dad?

955
01:17:21,601 --> 01:17:24,321
You have stayed here long enough,
let's go home now, Dad.

956
01:17:25,121 --> 01:17:28,561
- I am finally ready.
- Dad..

957
01:17:29,481 --> 01:17:32,401
Now leave.
No, Dad. You come with me.

958
01:17:33,081 --> 01:17:34,121
Come. Let's go.

959
01:17:36,281 --> 01:17:39,321
You have stayed here long enough.

960
01:17:40,121 --> 01:17:41,681
I am an elephant.

961
01:17:43,121 --> 01:17:44,801
Now leave me alone.

962
01:17:45,521 --> 01:17:46,561
Dad..

963
01:17:47,601 --> 01:17:50,801
- Please come back with me.
- Let it be.

964
01:17:54,401 --> 01:17:56,121
Leave me alone.

965
01:19:10,241 --> 01:19:12,801
- Have you taken everything?
- Yes.

966
01:19:51,321 --> 01:19:53,161
I will come back soon, Dad.

967
01:22:15,561 --> 01:22:17,241
Will you cook
meals for yourself?

968
01:22:49,041 --> 01:22:52,321
I came back for you.

969
01:22:57,881 --> 01:23:01,161
- You left him alone there and came back.
- You left him alone there and came back.

970
01:23:37,321 --> 01:23:38,441
Lata!

971
01:25:31,321 --> 01:25:35,441
'Dayanand Kumar.
02.03.2016-30.03.2016.'

972
01:27:06,201 --> 01:27:08,081
'Do what your heart says.'

973
01:27:11,041 --> 01:27:14,041
'The heart alone is the truth,
the rest is an illusion.'

974
01:27:14,961 --> 01:27:17,681
'Look at the dream shattering.'

975
01:27:19,121 --> 01:27:20,601
'Listen to the heart.'

976
01:27:20,761 --> 01:27:22,241
'Know where your heart lies.'

977
01:27:22,721 --> 01:27:25,121
'Teach yourself the heart's ways.'

978
01:27:26,601 --> 01:27:29,241
'Do what your heart says.
Do as your heart says.'

979
01:27:30,121 --> 01:27:32,121
'Else, suffer till your last day.'

980
01:27:34,801 --> 01:27:38,761
'Dayanand Kumar was
a famous poet and author.'

981
01:27:40,121 --> 01:27:42,321
'You can still find his'

982
01:27:42,601 --> 01:27:46,721
'works biting the dust
in the nooks and crannies'

983
01:27:51,241 --> 01:27:53,521
'of old book shops.'

984
01:27:54,601 --> 01:27:56,601
'Should they taste dust
or termites?'

985
01:27:58,441 --> 01:27:59,441
What?

986
01:28:00,201 --> 01:28:01,321
That's what it says!

987
01:28:05,481 --> 01:28:07,201
'Should they taste
dust or termites?'

988
01:28:51,721 --> 01:28:53,841
- Let's go.
- Yes.

989
01:29:20,761 --> 01:29:22,761
Let's go..
