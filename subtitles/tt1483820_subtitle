- Lyer! Are you fine?
- I'm fine. Come fast.

15
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:28,120
I need 3 basketsful of fishes today!

16
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,870
You usually buy 1 kilo only.

17
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:33,290
- Ok. Give him.
- That was only for me.

18
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:36,620
My relatives are coming
from my home town.

19
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,950
Look! Give me only fish!
We are pure vegetarian!

20
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:44,200
Take it. My aunt in Delhi
has sent intense sticks.

21
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,830
- How much?
- 25 lakhs.

22
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:55,410
25 lakhs!

23
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,660
When does the saint come?

24
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:00,080
- During Dussera.
- Ok, we will finish him.

25
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,410
We have to be very careful this time!

26
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,580
Someone should be
newly born to beat us

27
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:33,330
I am a champion.

28
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:34,830
My mind is craving!

29
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:36,910
Why don't we have a session of joy?

30
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,740
My job is very joyful!

31
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,330
There is enough wealth!

32
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:44,410
And money also increases!

33
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:51,660
God bestows enough money!

34
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:58,740
Aadhavan comes along to
share the money!

35
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:02,740
Rose! Rose!
The king comes to sing.

36
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:06,330
I am a champion.

37
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:07,830
My mind is craving!

38
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:09,830
Why don't we have a session of joy?

39
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,740
My job is very joyful!

40
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,330
There is enough wealth!

41
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:17,580
And money also increases!

42
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,829
Don't remember the past.

43
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:57,410
I do not think about tomorrow.

44
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,990
I have only today more than anything.

45
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,910
No worries in my mind either.

46
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:12,240
Is the life arithmetic
to calculate and live?

47
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:15,740
You enjoy life to the extreme!

48
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:19,660
There is nothing of moral quality.

49
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,490
I have no fear whatsoever.

50
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,490
Time will come for the success.

51
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,740
I am a champion.

52
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,410
My mind is craving!

53
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,410
Why don't we have a session of joy?

54
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,990
My job is very joyful!

55
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,740
There is enough wealth!

56
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,740
And money also increases!

57
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,740
The opportunity will
come for everyone!

58
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:14,410
The earth will open for you for that!

59
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,910
There will be a lot of changes
in your path.

60
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,740
You will attain your goal
if you aim for it.

61
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:25,490
Sky above and earth below!

62
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:29,160
Memorable days are in middle!

63
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:32,740
There is no burden on the shoulder!

64
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:36,580
The gutsy fellow
will walk over the sea.

65
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:40,410
Turn back and see and
you will feel very happy!

66
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,540
I am a champion.

67
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:49,200
My mind is craving!

68
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:51,200
Why don't we have a session of joy?

69
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:54,790
My job is very joyful!

70
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:56,620
There is enough wealth!

71
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,620
And money also increases!

72
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:05,790
God bestows enough money!

73
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:12,950
Even sun has come
and told me to take it.

74
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:17,120
Rose! Rose! The king
has come and sang.

75
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:06,870
Stop.

76
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,540
Do it.

77
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:16,870
Bravo!
My son has done it!

78
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,620
You look very happy dad!

79
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,790
It's because of you, son.

80
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,200
We would have got
the next order right away.

81
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:26,700
I am not an agent anymore.

82
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,370
You have shot him from under the water.

83
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:29,950
So the dealing has clicked.

84
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,790
The amount would have doubled up.

85
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,620
- You are always keen on that.
- Sorry dad!

86
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,790
Look at your brother!
He is very smart!

87
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:38,790
Give me the next order!
I will show my talent.

88
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:41,870
- How is that?
- You are asking me that.

89
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:45,870
No need to bother
when I have my brother!

90
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,790
True.

91
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:52,870
- Aadhavan! Next order is not here.. But abroad!
- Is it so?

92
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,240
You will get it.

93
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:23,240
- It is free.. we can have plenty.
- Dad...!

94
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,740
We are going to Mumbai
as someone has called us.

95
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:29,830
Do you know who he is..
Or do you have his address?

96
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:32,330
One guy will be there with a board
written on it as Amar Singh!

97
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:34,330
We will come to know
from him, everything.

98
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:36,910
Why do you have dealing
with strange people?

99
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,740
We should not get caught if anything
happens! That is very important.

100
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:41,740
The US saint is a stranger to you!

101
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:43,830
You shot him from under water..

102
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:46,830
...and that came as the headlines!

103
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:49,580
Police will close the file
as there is no evidence!

104
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:52,080
Do you want to shoot
with different disguises?

105
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,910
If get caught we will be
life term prisoners.

106
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,990
All I want is a small 5 star hotel.

107
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,330
- We will give up everything after that.
- Your desire..

108
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:00,240
The US saint is a stranger to you!

109
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:02,660
You shot him from under water..

110
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:05,910
...-and that came as the headlines!
- Police has not closed the file yet.

111
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,910
They are waiting for the evidence.

112
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,830
- Run!
- Sit there.

113
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:12,830
Are you going to jump out?

114
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:15,830
- I'm not the police. Don't get scared.
- Oops!

115
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:18,830
Why did you record all this, sir?

116
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:21,580
You have no business to know that.

117
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,080
Your return tickets are in this!

118
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,490
When you land in Mumbai you can
go back to Kolkata in the next flight!

119
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,910
No! As we have to meet
a person in Mumbai..

120
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,580
It is me you wanted to meet.

121
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,740
I am the one who called you there!

122
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,490
If the dealing was done
in the flight itself..

123
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,660
...you would not know where I stay!

124
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:43,660
That's why I wanted to have
the deal in the air.

125
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:48,160
Tomorrow, my man will come and
meet you with full details..

126
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:52,580
...about whom you are you going to kill,
when and where.

127
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,080
...with full amount.

128
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:55,830
Don't worry!

129
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:57,490
How many men would
you need to kill him?

130
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:58,490
Only one!

131
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:01,660
Aadhavan only should do that,
from a far distance.

132
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:05,160
Because, no one can go near
him so easily. Ok?

133
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,660
When will I get the details about him?

134
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:10,740
My man will tell the details,
if you show the return ticket.

135
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,660
Your audio is in my hand.

136
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:16,660
Your video is also in my hand.

137
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:21,080
Tomorrow, my man will come and
meet you with full details..

138
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,330
...that whom you are you going to kill,
when and where.

139
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:29,910
How did you shoot that?

140
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,990
With whom are you playing?

141
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,740
He is a mischievous guy.

142
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:39,740
Is he a mischievous guy?

143
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:43,080
He will ask the rate of this flight
in six months.

144
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,240
Your audio.

145
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:58,120
God has created..

146
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,450
...and gave that to me..

147
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:00,950
- Are you ready?
- Yes, we are.

148
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,200
Has the party come?

149
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:03,790
Commissioner's car has come.

150
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,870
He will come behind this car.

151
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:14,700
- I've arranged four people to watch around.
- Park the car in the car park.

152
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:22,790
God has sent me
to enjoy everything.

153
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:36,200
- He has come.
- Be ready.

154
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:45,290
It is very crowded.
How could I shoot him?

155
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:46,790
There are too many.

156
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:47,790
Whom should I kill?

157
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:51,290
Look! Assistant commissioner over there.

158
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,870
- Do you see the Asst. commissioner?
- Yes I do.

159
00:15:55,950 --> 00:16:00,370
Follow him.
He will give a rose flower to a child.

160
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:03,870
The child will give the rose flower
to the one who is the judge!

161
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:06,790
Judge? Has he given a wrong judgement?

162
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:08,790
Don't get distracted.
He may go in!

163
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:19,200
Shoot the judge.

164
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:24,120
What have you done?

165
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,870
What have you done?
Start.

166
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,870
Go inside sir!

167
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:35,120
There is the sardarji!

168
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:40,040
- Run fast!
- Come fast dad!

169
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:43,120
Stop!

170
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,540
- Oh gosh!
- Mov aside dad!

171
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:47,790
Don't you know how I hit you?

172
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:49,290
Try to escape using that.

173
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:55,200
Who was that guy?
Tell.

174
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:57,120
I saw two men coming!

175
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,620
One has hit me and ran off.

176
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:00,700
Who hit you?
Tell me.

177
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:02,200
One hit me and ran off there.

178
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:03,620
Another one ran upstairs!

179
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:04,790
Follow the guy.

180
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:06,870
The rest can come with me.

181
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:11,450
Thank God!

182
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:55,790
Hey stop...!

183
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,370
Stop!

184
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:35,200
Do you know how many
parents are crying..

185
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:37,870
...as their children suffered
such a terrible tragedy?

186
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:40,620
Lorries full of skeletons
were taken out

187
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:43,700
Many parents are praying God
that bones of their children..

188
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:47,450
...shouldn't be in that lot.

189
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:50,870
The CBI has formed a enquiry commission,
with I as the chief..

190
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,040
...to investigate this cruel act.

191
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,120
Someone asked in Tamil if I would
wind up the commission..

192
00:20:56,330 --> 00:21:00,660
...if I were given crores of money.

193
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:01,910
Who is that?

194
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:05,830
Some of the press people
have asked me these questions!

195
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:07,990
That's why I have showed
those clippings to you.

196
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,330
A question to you commissioner sir!

197
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,990
Will you find out the killer
who has escaped?

198
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,330
If I don't find out
it is a shame for me..

199
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:44,410
...as well as for my department.

200
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:48,240
Mr.Yogi! How far you and
your department are helpful to him?

201
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:53,910
The government and the chief minister
have helped to form this commission.

202
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,580
What will you do if they threaten you?

203
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:58,240
What are you asking me?

204
00:21:58,330 --> 00:21:59,910
I've told several times that..

205
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,910
...I wouldn't be afraid of anything.

206
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,660
Look! I will go back home only
after finding out the culprit..

207
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:08,330
...and wind up the enquiry commission
even if I've risk my life.

208
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,830
What do you mean by live telecast?

209
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:12,740
Do you think that I will
keep replying your questions?

210
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:14,330
I've thousands of work to do.

211
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:15,990
You have only this work.

212
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:19,830
People won't even sit
before a judge in the court!

213
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:21,990
You seem to go on asking questions!

214
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,330
I agree that he is a judge..

215
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:27,160
Keep quiet. It is shameful
to other press people too.

216
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:45,200
I'm not alone here.

217
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:49,790
My large family has
come with me to celebrate..

218
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:52,540
...Christmas in Kolkata! Enough?

219
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,290
They want our ship
for hire for 10 ten days.

220
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:00,950
I've asked a good price!
Shall I call them?

221
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,040
Tell them to wait down stairs!

222
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,370
No, they want to see our ship.
Downstairs..

223
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:17,620
It's all because of you.
You have become more playful.

224
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,620
You said you'll finish him somehow!

225
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,620
Now we are in a terrible state.

226
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,450
There should be some
seriousness in your work.

227
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:25,200
That should be very much
needed for our work.

228
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:29,200
Come Reddy! Please come!

229
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:31,290
Get him a chair.

230
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:33,620
- Please sit.
- Take your hand off.

231
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:36,450
Don't get tense.
You ask me what you need now.

232
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,950
What shall I ask now?

233
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,700
If there was an agent,
I would have asked him.

234
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:42,290
I have come here myself.

235
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:45,700
I would have killed
the judge.. like this.

236
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:47,290
That much time is enough.

237
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:49,370
But my group will get caught.

238
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:52,540
He talks like a big shot! Kid!

239
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:53,790
What has happened now?

240
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:56,370
He is a small guy..
And has done only a small mistake..

241
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:57,870
...it is a big mistake.

242
00:23:58,290 --> 00:23:59,950
So, you agree he is a small boy.

243
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,370
...is a playful guy.

244
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:03,540
...and vacating the house.

245
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:06,290
Taking him on bail
if he steals a cycle.

246
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:10,450
You may do silly work like this.

247
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:12,870
You should not talk business
in the business class.

248
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:16,200
You are reminding us
what he did 5 years ago.

249
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:18,290
Is it good?
We have to think before we do.

250
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:19,620
Be calm.

251
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:23,950
Whom do you ask to be calm?

252
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:35,370
Leave him.
Leave him.

253
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:37,290
Leave him.

254
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:39,870
Aadhava leave him.

255
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,910
What do you show your rage to me?

256
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,080
Show it to him by killing him!

257
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:58,410
If you talk again,
you will not be alive.

258
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:00,580
Throw his money on him.

259
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:04,410
Are you playing?
The money had been spent.

260
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:22,950
Your target would have missed.

261
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:27,370
...but since my childhood
my target and aim..

262
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:28,950
...have not missed.

263
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,450
It has not missed now yet.

264
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:32,290
The judge has a longer life.

265
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:35,200
The judge is your target so far.

266
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:37,120
He is my target from now on.

267
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:41,290
He is going to die at
my hands in future.

268
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,290
Go. I said you to go.

269
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:46,790
If you do it or not with an agent..

270
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:50,950
I will finish him within ten days
before he submits the enquiry.

271
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,290
This is not the full amount.

272
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:22,790
I'll give you four times
of this in ten days!

273
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,950
- Allah!
- After the work is over.

274
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,290
Sure. He will finish him.

275
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:31,040
National security force is
giving protection to the judge.

276
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,790
Tell him to be alert.

277
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:35,120
What mom? Is everybody
doing the exercises well?

278
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,120
Superb! Will I leave them, if not?

279
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,540
All are doing well!

280
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:51,370
Except one girl who is creating
havoc in your absence..

281
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:56,120
...by keeping the gym
masters in her hands.

282
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:01,290
- Why do you do like this?
- I didn't do anything.

283
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:03,450
You should be an example to others.

284
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:05,450
You should not harm others.

285
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:07,450
You should do the exercises properly.

286
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:12,540
- After I am gone..
- Oops!

287
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:21,740
What do you want to tell me?

288
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:23,740
I wanted to tell that, it is okay.

289
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,990
Sir...!

290
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:32,160
Why were you silent
when I stretched my hands?

291
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:34,080
Can't you tell that you're
bringing the milk for me?

292
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,660
Sir!

293
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:40,490
- What?
- Why did you wipe it off?

294
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:42,990
To avoid any milk on my hands.
That's why.

295
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:43,990
That's right!

296
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,580
You..

297
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,330
Did you get it from him?

298
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:52,580
She is the next target of his.

299
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:05,740
Ready to start a fast number!

300
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:10,580
Very very cute,
show your prowess to them!

301
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:11,660
Madam, start..

302
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:15,910
Don't feel comnfined.
Make it cool like a hill station

303
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:22,330
This Kannada beauty
would sway her hip to the song!

304
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,240
Look! Look!

305
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:33,240
Who will come out as the winner?

306
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:35,580
The flower or fruit?

307
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:38,580
Would we get equal marks?

308
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:40,910
Nose or tongue?

309
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,990
Are those two weak for you?

310
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:49,410
Is your body sticky
like a Spencer cake?

311
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,580
You naughty aunty!

312
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,910
Stretching your tongue..

313
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:57,080
Why do you fight with me?

314
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,830
- You should run off from me.
- Are you not ashamed?

315
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:02,910
You are an old lady!

316
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:05,740
Give me your advise!

317
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,660
The place won't stand you!

318
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:10,830
You will be with energy always!

319
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:26,910
Everyone would be
mesmerized for her body!

320
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:34,830
Look! There is an old lady
who has gone down!

321
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:37,580
There will be a fight
between the two now!

322
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:40,240
Old lady..

323
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:41,580
Oops! Go off, you two!

324
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,830
Fight between those two!

325
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:48,330
For her moon and catwalk..

326
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:53,240
...even Sehwag would
get bowled out!

327
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:09,240
- Who is it?
- Womanhood is very tenderly.

328
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:14,410
You will know this
truth in due comurse.

329
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:20,240
Old will win the modern one like you.

330
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:25,490
The strength of the branches
is in the roots!

331
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:04,990
My hip is slender!

332
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:09,830
My looks are seductive!

333
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:26,330
Don't try to do anything
beyond your limit.

334
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:31,410
Don't boast about yourself.

335
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:36,740
Can a small river win
over the Bay of Bengal?

336
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:39,910
Why do you need a glamorous T-shirt?

337
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,410
When you can look sensuous in a sari.

338
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:47,990
Look! Who will come
out as the winner?

339
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,240
The flower or fruit?

340
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:53,330
Who will reap those two?

341
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:55,490
Nose or tongue?

342
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:58,490
Are those two weak for you?

343
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:03,990
Is your body sticky
like Spencer cake?

344
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:07,080
You naughty aunty!

345
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:09,410
Stretch your tongue!

346
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:11,580
Why do you fight with me?

347
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:14,490
You should run off from me.

348
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:17,410
Your grandma is old.

349
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,990
Old is gold.

350
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:22,330
Gold is bold.

351
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:25,330
You will be with energy always.

352
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:26,740
Bring her down.

353
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,330
Why the grand child and grandma
are always fighting?

354
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:31,580
- Grandma?
- Then?

355
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:32,740
Grandma..

356
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:34,740
- What?
- When did we fight?

357
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:38,410
- What were you doing now?
- We were doing Yoga. -Yoga?

358
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:47,410
Kevura! Where is Kevura?

359
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,330
Tell me where is Kevura?

360
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:50,990
Who has pushed me?

361
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:55,080
He dashed me and doesn't
care about it, idiot (puramboke).

362
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:58,410
How did he know when
I scolded him in Tamil?

363
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:01,330
He looks at me very harsh!

364
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:03,740
I wonder how Kolkata hit will be.

365
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:05,990
He has gone off.

366
00:34:08,410 --> 00:34:09,580
What is puramboke?

367
00:34:11,410 --> 00:34:13,240
Puram means back.

368
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:15,410
Poke means loose motion!

369
00:34:18,410 --> 00:34:20,240
Sir! Where is the basement?

370
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:22,160
- I have found it.
- What is this nonsense?

371
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:23,910
Sir! Tamil wizard!

372
00:34:24,330 --> 00:34:26,490
It is very difficult to find
Tamil people in Kolkata.

373
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:29,990
That too to see a wizard
like you is very rare.

374
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:33,990
You have given a clear
explanation for puramboke.

375
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,240
You have found it very fast.

376
00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:38,410
Are you a Tamilian?

377
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,990
Were I talking in English so far?

378
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:45,330
I was afraid that
you were a North Indian.

379
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:47,080
- Where are your hands?
- They are here.

380
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,990
You have confirmed that
you are a Tamilian.

381
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,410
What are you doing here?

382
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,240
Why do you ask me that?

383
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:54,330
I asked my kin to
come here from home.

384
00:34:54,410 --> 00:34:58,160
He said that he has come
and is standing near a bridge.

385
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:00,330
I asked him the name of the bridge.

386
00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:02,830
He told something like Kevura or Avura!

387
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:03,910
Is it Howrah bridge?

388
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,080
Yes, that is the one
he told me over phone.

389
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,330
Where is that, sir?

390
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:08,490
Don't ridicule.

391
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:10,330
I didn't do anything like that.

392
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:12,830
You are standing on the Howrah Bridge
and asking me where it is.

393
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:14,740
Is it not ridiculing?

394
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:18,240
I didn't know it till now.
My God!

395
00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:20,490
Had you shown me
this bridge in our native..

396
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:22,580
...I would have built a temple for you.

397
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:24,410
Where do we have Howrah Bridge there?

398
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:26,330
Don't we have it there?

399
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:29,330
I'll look for my kin.
Kin!

400
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:31,910
You look very tense.
Let us have tea.

401
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:32,990
Give us two cups of tea!

402
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,080
- Did you order the tea?
- Yes! -How much?

403
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:38,240
- I will pay the bill.
- Then, order spicy milk. -Is it?

404
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:41,370
- Two Jigiridantha dooth(spicy milk).
- Jigiridantha dooth means?

405
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:42,490
Dooth means milk.

406
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,200
Jiggiridantha milk means spicy milk.

407
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:46,410
So, you have ordered
to my choice.

408
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,990
Shouldn't I order to your choice?

409
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,830
- Jiggiridantha dooth(spicy milk)!
- Give me!

410
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:51,410
Is this?

411
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:55,910
- Why did you drink so fast?
- Nothing, it is very tasty.

412
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,490
- That's why I had it fast.
- Ok, give one more cup.

413
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:01,660
- No... -Ok, cancel!
- You won't listen, if I say no.

414
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:03,990
Order some more cups!
Let me have them.

415
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:06,410
Jiggiridantha..

416
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,870
What is your name?

417
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:12,910
- Banerjee!
- Banerjee? -Yes

418
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:15,080
It does not sound as a Tamil name.

419
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,080
You are right!

420
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,330
- My original name is Kuppan!
- Oh gosh!

421
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:22,660
They called me Banner Kuppan
because I used to stick cinema banners.

422
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:25,080
I felt uneasy.

423
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,870
So, like Sivajee, Nehrujee,
and Nethajee..

424
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:31,660
I took the jee from that
and joined with banner.

425
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:34,660
My name is Banerjee since then.

426
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,540
Banerjee is very famous name in Kolkata.

427
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:38,660
I am very famous all over the world.

428
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:41,490
- One more.
- Why are you asking?

429
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:43,410
Henceforth I have to order.

430
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:45,490
Jiggiri..

431
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:51,490
Dhooth(milk)!

432
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:55,450
Jiggiridantha dhooth(Spicy milk)!

433
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,450
You've drunk so fast, haven't you?

434
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:01,620
Jiggiridantha is very tasty.

435
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:04,040
- I feel like floating.
- Is it?

436
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:09,290
- Why is he taking away the shop?
- He is taking away his shop.

437
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:11,950
- Isn't it?
- Bye!

438
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:15,370
- Why are they saying bye?
- Cricket match is going on.

439
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:17,040
Is it?

440
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:19,620
- Haven't in-law come?
- He will come now.

441
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:21,450
He should come.

442
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:23,410
- He will come.
- He should come.

443
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:29,660
Fine. I feel like floating in the ship.

444
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:34,120
- Are you feeling that there is water around you?
- Yes!

445
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:36,450
- You had the drink a little too much.
- Is it?

446
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:38,790
Then, I don't need this.

447
00:37:40,870 --> 00:37:42,370
Why is there a crushing sound?

448
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:43,870
So, we are in the ground only.

449
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:48,040
- Fine...! -What?
- Why do I feel giddy?

450
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,370
If you've worries in your mind,
it'll be like that.

451
00:37:50,410 --> 00:37:53,290
- We have to tell it to somebody.
- Then, I will share it.

452
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:55,410
- First, do that.
- I.. -You..

453
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:58,240
I feel agonised where
I have been working.

454
00:37:58,370 --> 00:38:02,450
In that house everyone from the kids
to the old people torture me.

455
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:05,910
- So pity.
- At what time will you've breakfast?

456
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,040
- I eat at 8 'o clock.
- I eat at 12:30 usually.

457
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,160
- Then, lunch?
- At 4:30.

458
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:13,240
- Dinner?
- It will be dawn.

459
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:15,290
- Sleep...?
- You too..

460
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:18,290
The rooster's crow and the
belch comes out after eating..

461
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:20,540
...both will come at the same time.

462
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:22,910
- Then, how would I sleep?
- Have you suffered a lot?

463
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,620
That's why I feel giddy since then.

464
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:28,490
- Look, we are walking in the ground, isn't it?
- Yes!

465
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:33,240
But, I feel now that we are
walking on the steps.

466
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:36,240
- Oh gosh! Your legs are swollen!
- Who have tortured you like this?

467
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:37,830
That judge only.

468
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:41,160
I've served only to his family
when we were there.

469
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:44,290
But, he has brought a school
with him and torturing me.

470
00:38:44,370 --> 00:38:48,240
- I'll kill him as I feel very furious.
- Who?

471
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:49,450
That judge only.

472
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:53,700
Day before yesterday someone
tried to shoot him and failed

473
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:55,870
But he escaped from that.

474
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,080
Do you know why?

475
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,290
It is his fate that I should
shoot him to death.

476
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:00,290
Do you know how to shoot?

477
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:03,200
Shooting with a gun is
like cooking a pizza.

478
00:39:03,330 --> 00:39:06,290
- If you don't get a gun...?
- I'll stab him with a knife.

479
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:09,240
- If you don't get a knife...?
- I'll bite off his throat and swallow it.

480
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:10,370
Enough! Come!

481
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:12,080
Yet. I didn't become cool..

482
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:15,370
I haven't yet done the murder.
Why have they put me in the cage?

483
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:17,620
- Your hon our..
- Come.

484
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:20,790
- They'll erect the banner, come.
- Leave me, brother.

485
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:24,700
- Have my kin come?
- He might..

486
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:26,620
- But he won't come!
- That's right!

487
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,790
This looks like a theatre.

488
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:32,200
Now only we bought tickets
by standing in queue, isn't it?

489
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:34,370
- Did you forget that?
- Yes, isn't it?

490
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:36,120
No!
Yes!

491
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:39,330
- Sit!
- Oh gosh!

492
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:41,290
Looks like a heavy crowd.

493
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:43,540
- Did they put the house full board outside?
- Yes!

494
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,950
Excuse me! Is it an action
or a comedy film?

495
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,330
Killer film.

496
00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:53,410
Excuse me!

497
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:56,240
You said that it is a killer film,
but they are showing King Kong.

498
00:39:56,330 --> 00:39:58,660
- That monkey is you only.
- Is it me?

499
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:01,700
But he is torturing me
by bringing a whole school.

500
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:03,950
What all I spoke in the ground
is coming on screen.

501
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,830
Live telecast!
Just a little delay.

502
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:09,080
I am going to kill him
as I feel very angry.

503
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,540
Oh gosh! I have talked very harsh.

504
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:16,370
The day before yesterday someone
tried to shoot him and failed

505
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:18,370
Hey Mr..
I just said..

506
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,580
...but you would run this
for 100 days as a movie.

507
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,410
Fine! I am only in this,
Why aren't you seen in this?

508
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:27,290
- They has zoomed you.
- Zoom?

509
00:40:27,330 --> 00:40:28,990
It is his fate that I have to
shoot him to die.

510
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:31,700
Oh gosh! Dubbing is very clear.

511
00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:32,990
Don't I know how to shoot...?

512
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:37,290
- I'll stab him with a knife!
- Fantastic!

513
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:40,870
Are they showing MGR's movie?
Why are you applauding?

514
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,660
Keep silent!
Judge only.

515
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:46,120
I mean that judge.
Why has it been edited?

516
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:48,990
Have you done the re-recording too?

517
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,990
When did all this happen?

518
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,490
We did this while the shooting.

519
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:56,410
- Why have you shot this?
- To do the murder

520
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:58,990
To do the murder!

521
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,910
Who is he?
Editor?

522
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,490
No, he is the director of this episode.

523
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:06,330
You are telling that he is a director.
But he is talking about murder.

524
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:09,370
- Whom are you going to kill?
- Judge.

525
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:13,830
- Which judge?
- Judge whom you told to kill.

526
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,620
- Why do you want to kill him?
- We have got crores of money.

527
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:20,080
- Then?
- Judge is going to die.

528
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:21,490
...and it is me who would kill him.

529
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:23,160
It is you, who would get jailed.

530
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:25,080
- To where?
- To the jail.

531
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:28,080
- Why? -You gave the statement.
- About what?

532
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,490
- Didn't you see in the movie?
- Yes!

533
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,540
Your statement is in the chip
which is in my phone.

534
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:35,660
I'll make a DVD of it and send it
to commissioner's office. Be careful!

535
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:37,040
You sinner.

536
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:41,580
Not only blabbering, I feel like traveling
in the ship because of your torture.

537
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:44,040
- You are in the ship only.
- In the ship?

538
00:41:44,290 --> 00:41:46,870
Have you blackmailed me
inside the ship?

539
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:50,290
I will handover you all to the police.

540
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:54,540
Oh gosh! Who is he?

541
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:56,540
Kin...!

542
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:58,790
Why are you standing at
the door like a watchman?

543
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:01,120
How are you?

544
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:04,290
I got back my life after I've seen you.

545
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:05,870
How is my sister?

546
00:42:06,450 --> 00:42:08,120
How are your parents?

547
00:42:15,290 --> 00:42:16,080
Kin!

548
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:19,990
All these standing
around us are killers.

549
00:42:20,410 --> 00:42:21,540
You don't get scared.

550
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:25,580
Please save me somehow.

551
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:30,950
Why are you just making sound?
What happened?

552
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,950
Why they have operated in your mouth?

553
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,910
You mad! Are you my uncle?

554
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:37,040
You black guy.

555
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:38,580
Do you eat the rice or anything else?

556
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:40,450
I have to beat you in
the centre of your back.

557
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:42,700
You shouldn't scold me like this

558
00:42:42,790 --> 00:42:45,290
- It looks shame, isn't it?
- Leave me!

559
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:47,120
I accepted to marry your sister
who is black..

560
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:49,240
...because I felt pity
as you are my aunt's son.

561
00:42:49,330 --> 00:42:51,040
You have to build a temple
and worship me for that.

562
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:53,540
Are you trying to fix me up to
this rowdy gang despite that?

563
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:54,870
- Me?
- Then!

564
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,200
They cheated me by showing the
Howrah bridge and gave me spicy milk.

565
00:42:58,330 --> 00:43:00,410
- Did you know how much they tortured me?
- You too?

566
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,200
Oh gosh!

567
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:04,790
You are crying like me.

568
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,870
- That is blood relation.
- If I punch you, blood will come out.

569
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:11,040
You wish to kill the judge, you want me
to be a witness for that murder?

570
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,790
Lie...!

571
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:15,200
I am talking here. Why are you
shaking your hands over there?

572
00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:16,790
No, they would have fixed
cameras around us.

573
00:43:16,870 --> 00:43:20,450
They will shoot and show it to us
as a film without our knowledge..

574
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:22,790
You better release me!

575
00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:24,950
Else I won't marry your sister.

576
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,990
Don't say like that!
Be brave!

577
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:29,290
I will release you.
Wait a minute!

578
00:43:29,370 --> 00:43:33,450
Sir, my sister is very beautiful.
But she is little black.

579
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:35,450
He is the only guy who looks fair
and I fixed him for her.

580
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:37,700
Nobody is there to marry
her other than him.

581
00:43:37,830 --> 00:43:41,620
So, please first release him.
And release me after some time.

582
00:43:43,450 --> 00:43:44,950
Who is playing by throwing
stones in the water?

583
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:47,580
- Oh gosh! Uncle save me.
- Why my kin is shouting?

584
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:50,290
- Kin! -They pushed me in the water.
- Oh gosh! Kin!

585
00:43:50,370 --> 00:43:51,290
I don't know swimming.

586
00:43:51,370 --> 00:43:53,120
My kin has fallen down in the water.
Save him!

587
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,790
He doesn't know swimming.
He is drinking water also.

588
00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:57,660
Oh gosh! Kin..

589
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:01,490
I asked you to save him
but you are shooting him.

590
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:02,910
No!

591
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:04,660
Dear!

592
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:08,580
Don't spoil my sister's life
by killing him.

593
00:44:08,950 --> 00:44:12,660
I'll obey to whatever you say.

594
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:19,160
Why are you howling like a fox?

595
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:22,410
- Then, are we going to a function to sing?
- I will tear your mouth.

596
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:24,620
- Tell, who am I?
- You are a killer!

597
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:26,080
That is for the judge.
For you...?

598
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,700
- You are my kin.
- From where have I come?

599
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:29,490
- From Pollachi!
- My name?

600
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:31,540
Till now, you are Aadhavan.
Hence you are Murugan.

601
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:32,620
Not bad!

602
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:35,290
You have drunk six cups of tipsy milk,
but you are speaking clearly.

603
00:44:35,410 --> 00:44:36,410
Tipsy milk?

604
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:39,740
- They told that it was spice milk!
- It is tipsy milk in Bengali.

605
00:44:39,870 --> 00:44:42,950
You cheater..
I have mentioned me.

606
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:44,700
Muruga...?

607
00:44:44,910 --> 00:44:46,620
Which Murugan?

608
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:48,370
I have mentioned
your kin relation Murugan.

609
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:49,790
If you misbehave..

610
00:44:49,950 --> 00:44:52,700
Don't forget your kin
Murugan who is in the ship..

611
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:54,120
...and the chip which is in my mobile.

612
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:55,160
Both will be spoiled.

613
00:44:55,290 --> 00:44:56,700
Oh gosh!
Why do you talk like that?

614
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,290
- Uncle, move aside! -Oh gosh!
- Why is he running?

615
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:02,370
Is he scared after seeing
the police and house?

616
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:04,740
So, we have to catch him.
Go and catch him.

617
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:06,790
- Go fast! He is running. Catch him.
- Go fast!

618
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:10,620
Oh gosh! No! Tell him
to leave me. I feel scared.

619
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:14,700
Don't you know that in our family
we will get diarrhea if we see the police?

620
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:16,410
They all are well known
for you, isn't it?

621
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:18,160
Tell them, I'll go off to
my native place

622
00:45:18,290 --> 00:45:21,450
- Oh gosh!
- Who is he?

623
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:22,790
He is calling you as uncle.

624
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:26,990
- He is.. -Oh Muruga...!
- He is my relative.

625
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:28,950
- What about you?
- He is my kin.

626
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:30,290
Why did he come here?

627
00:45:31,370 --> 00:45:32,870
He has come to work as my assistant.

628
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,740
- Did you get the permission from sir?
- No!

629
00:45:35,410 --> 00:45:36,200
I have to get the permission.

630
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:37,700
I got the permission.

631
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,540
Have they got the permission?

632
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:43,540
Why are they speaking in Telugu?

633
00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:44,870
Telugu?

634
00:45:45,370 --> 00:45:47,620
Don't you know that
he is speaking Bengali?

635
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:49,540
I don't know any other
language except Tamil.

636
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:51,540
Ask him to leave me!
I will go off to my native.

637
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:53,990
You Singh...

638
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,700
Thank God, he wants to go by himself.
Leave him!

639
00:45:56,870 --> 00:45:58,620
It will be good for you.

640
00:46:06,290 --> 00:46:07,790
Why is he taking finger prints..

641
00:46:08,870 --> 00:46:10,200
Look at this!

642
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:12,700
It is me..

643
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:15,040
- Go this way and come out that way.
- Ok!

644
00:46:16,870 --> 00:46:19,330
Uncle, I feel scared.
Come with me

645
00:46:19,450 --> 00:46:21,410
I should say that instead.

646
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:22,700
Go man!

647
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:25,700
Oh gosh!
Uncle it is shouting..

648
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:34,790
You'll get caught now, my kin.

649
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:39,830
There is some metal here.

650
00:46:39,910 --> 00:46:42,450
Check every baggage!

651
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:44,450
- Check everything.
- Just a minute, sir.

652
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:47,370
Sir...! Give all this to my uncle.

653
00:46:47,450 --> 00:46:49,450
It is enough for me.
It is my house key.

654
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:52,450
- I'll go off to my native.
- Is it a key? -Yes!

655
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:54,240
That's why the beep sound.

656
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:57,290
- Shall I go...? -No, problem.
- You may go.

657
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:11,700
Madam! I have understand.

658
00:47:11,790 --> 00:47:14,700
I know, why you all are
looking like this.

659
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:16,910
You don't want him
to stay here, isn't it?

660
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:20,790
I'll send him. You start!
I will struggle alone.

661
00:47:20,950 --> 00:47:21,950
Uncle!

662
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:25,620
Oh gosh!
Kin..

663
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:27,580
Why should you go,
if you don't want to go?

664
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:29,830
Why are you crying for this?
You don't go, stay here.

665
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:31,490
Who is it?

666
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:34,660
- What work do you know?
- Dear! Are you asking me?

667
00:47:34,830 --> 00:47:36,540
What have you asked?
Ask me again.

668
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:39,410
- What slang is this?
- This is a Coimbatore slang.

669
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:42,330
I live a little interior.
Uncle stays in town.

670
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:44,740
- What uncle?
- What he said was right.

671
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:45,910
- Dear!
- Madam!

672
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:48,910
- You too speak in Coimbatore slang like him.
- That is..

673
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,700
Wherever we settle, we will get
our native slang if we see our natives.

674
00:47:52,790 --> 00:47:54,660
We will never forget, isn't it uncle?

675
00:47:54,750 --> 00:47:58,120
- How will we forget after shooting?
- Ok!

676
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,660
Answer to my questions
What work can you do?

677
00:48:00,830 --> 00:48:02,080
I can do all sorts of work.

678
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:03,580
I can do all the works
like maintaining house,

679
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:05,660
...gardening, and
handling computers etc..

680
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:08,080
Do you know about computer?

681
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:11,200
Computers are available cheap
even in our villages.

682
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:15,580
We will get the computers like Sony Vaio
to Apple.. in the Thursday market.

683
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:17,580
Ok, leave that!
I too know about that.

684
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:19,700
Which program me do you
like most in the TV?

685
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:22,370
Which color do you
like in Power rangers?

686
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:25,580
Do you see Jetix?
I like red color in power rangers.

687
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:27,910
I too like red color dear.
Shall I do like Jack?

688
00:48:37,950 --> 00:48:40,450
Hey, don't go there.
Bujjee is calling you.

689
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:44,540
I thought you like Jetix only.
Do you like Dora too?

690
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:46,240
I like to watch everything
from Jetix to cookings..

691
00:48:46,370 --> 00:48:48,700
...and from Dora to Thara.

692
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:51,620
What? What happened?

693
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:54,700
My aunt's name is Thara.
Do you like her too?

694
00:48:55,620 --> 00:48:57,040
Oh gosh! Sorry..

695
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:01,200
What do you know in cooking?

696
00:49:01,620 --> 00:49:03,540
Do you know to prepare
Vella Paniyaram(sweet)?

697
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:04,620
It is very simple..

698
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:06,790
Take a cup of rice and
add some black grams..

699
00:49:06,870 --> 00:49:09,910
...and drench it in the water for of
an hour and grind it for 15 minutes,

700
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,290
...and put it in the hot oil, fry it and
take out. It is the Vella paniyaram(sweet).

701
00:49:12,370 --> 00:49:15,040
- Oh gosh!
- If you add some jaggery and fry it well...

702
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:16,540
...you'll get the Karuppu
paniyaram (sweet). That's all!

703
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:18,200
My mouth waters
when he says that.

704
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:19,540
You have to prepare that tomorrow.

705
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:21,950
Why not? We will prepare(sudu-shoot) it
today itself, isn't it uncle?

706
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:24,700
Don't be in a hurry.
Please prepare it later..

707
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:27,950
He is telling that he'll prepare
today itself. Why do you worry?

708
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:30,450
You are talking about food always.

709
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:33,620
That's why you look like a
Karuppu paniyaram by over eating.

710
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:35,450
That is madam..
How much would we eat..

711
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:38,040
If we do Yoga for 30 minutes
by stretching our hands and legs..

712
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,700
...our body will become slim then.

713
00:49:40,330 --> 00:49:41,870
Do you know yoga too?

714
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:44,120
What grandma? Look here.

715
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:48,620
This is Sir as as an am..

716
00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:50,040
This is Mayurasanam grandma.

717
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:54,620
This is Chakrasanam by lifting one leg.

718
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:00,490
This is Veerabadrasanam.

719
00:50:02,620 --> 00:50:03,910
If you put your leg by
folding like this..

720
00:50:04,330 --> 00:50:05,620
...it is Vakkrasanam.

721
00:50:08,870 --> 00:50:10,450
Uncle, this is Chandrasanam.

722
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:15,580
Grandma, This is Sarvangasana.

723
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:18,620
This is Halasana..
And this is Karnapeedasanam.

724
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,330
This is one hand lifting Koormasanam.

725
00:50:23,450 --> 00:50:25,620
From where have you learned all this?

726
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,540
MGR has done in
the film Pattikatu Ponnaiya.

727
00:50:28,870 --> 00:50:30,620
Don't you know that?

728
00:50:30,750 --> 00:50:34,290
- Can we forget his movies?
- Yes!

729
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:36,620
My father has learned this
from his master after seeing him.

730
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:38,620
I learned it from my father.

731
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:41,160
Didn't you I earn anything
from Sivaji (actor)?

732
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:43,290
He is doing that too..

733
00:50:43,370 --> 00:50:45,870
So you can act well like Sivaji, right?

734
00:50:45,950 --> 00:50:48,200
I don't know to act like him.

735
00:50:48,290 --> 00:50:49,540
Do you want to act better than this?

736
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:52,160
Brother, you've brought a fish with you
when you came, isn't it?

737
00:50:52,290 --> 00:50:53,790
If you fry it, give the head for me.

738
00:50:53,870 --> 00:50:56,290
The head will not come separately,
if we fry it.

739
00:50:56,410 --> 00:50:58,370
Chop it! The head will
come out, isn't it?

740
00:50:58,870 --> 00:51:01,370
Uncle, shall we chop it?

741
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:04,040
Why are you asking me?

742
00:51:04,330 --> 00:51:06,700
You take your own decision,
and do whatever you want.

743
00:51:06,870 --> 00:51:08,370
Oh gosh!

744
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:28,870
Mother, have you finished eating?

745
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:32,120
I have. You go and eat.

746
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:36,790
- Who is he?
- Sir, I am here.

747
00:51:36,950 --> 00:51:38,370
I asked you who he is?

748
00:51:38,450 --> 00:51:39,700
He is my kin.

749
00:51:39,790 --> 00:51:42,200
I brought him to work as my assistant.

750
00:51:42,290 --> 00:51:45,370
Just tell no, immediately
I will send him out.

751
00:51:45,870 --> 00:51:48,450
- Don't you like him..
- Kin.. -Sir..

752
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:50,540
Sir, wear this slippers..

753
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:52,790
Don't go inside by wearing shoes.

754
00:51:52,870 --> 00:51:53,950
You travel many places..

755
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:55,790
...and stamp many things.

756
00:51:55,950 --> 00:51:57,700
Children are here..

757
00:51:57,790 --> 00:52:00,040
Whatever disease,
they will be affected by that...

758
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:02,370
...if they have low resistance.

759
00:52:02,450 --> 00:52:05,370
Please wear this slippers.

760
00:52:08,790 --> 00:52:10,790
He is more intelligent than you.

761
00:52:11,290 --> 00:52:12,790
Keep him for work.

762
00:52:13,450 --> 00:52:14,700
For work...?

763
00:52:14,790 --> 00:52:17,700
Oh gosh!
He himseif is making the mission easy.

764
00:52:17,790 --> 00:52:19,290
Grandma!

765
00:52:20,290 --> 00:52:21,200
Dear!

766
00:52:21,450 --> 00:52:23,370
I have seen all the movies.

767
00:52:23,450 --> 00:52:25,200
I have seen MGR's fighting..

768
00:52:25,290 --> 00:52:26,700
...and Sivaji's acting.

769
00:52:26,790 --> 00:52:30,370
I have seen Rajini's style and
various roles of Kamal Hassan.

770
00:52:30,450 --> 00:52:33,450
But, you are acting like them
at the same time.

771
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:35,040
It is very surprising.

772
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:37,700
You will get the award
without recommendation.

773
00:52:37,790 --> 00:52:39,200
Surely, you will get award.

774
00:52:39,620 --> 00:52:41,790
When I was telling it,
you act like Sivaji.

775
00:52:41,870 --> 00:52:44,120
I remember that day..
In my heart..

776
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:45,290
Murder..

777
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:50,700
How are you?
Are you keeping fine?

778
00:52:50,790 --> 00:52:52,040
Where is Prem?

779
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:53,700
Fine..

780
00:52:53,790 --> 00:52:54,700
Sir, now tell me.

781
00:52:54,790 --> 00:52:56,200
Nobody is here.

782
00:52:56,370 --> 00:52:57,540
Did he enter into the house?

783
00:52:57,620 --> 00:52:58,700
He has come.

784
00:52:58,790 --> 00:53:01,120
But, he looks innocent.

785
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:02,540
That is acting.

786
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:04,200
You don't believe that.

787
00:53:04,370 --> 00:53:07,450
He is very angry with judge.

788
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:10,700
Definitely, he will
finish the judge at the correct time.

789
00:53:10,790 --> 00:53:13,620
When he finishes judge,
the next moment..

790
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:16,540
...you have to shoot him.

791
00:53:16,620 --> 00:53:19,290
- Do you keep this in your mind?
- Yes, I do remember, sir!

792
00:53:19,370 --> 00:53:20,950
- But..
- Why, but...?

793
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:22,700
I shouldn't get involved..

794
00:53:22,790 --> 00:53:23,790
I am a family man.

795
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:27,990
How will you get caught?

796
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:30,740
You can say that..

797
00:53:30,830 --> 00:53:32,490
...he tried to escape after
shooting down judge and you shot him.

798
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:35,580
Not only that, the government
will give you an award.

799
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:37,660
And I will reward you too.

800
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:39,580
Shoot him with courage.

801
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:41,080
I will take care.

802
00:53:47,330 --> 00:53:48,740
What is this?

803
00:53:50,750 --> 00:53:51,740
Blood!

804
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:53,990
Has he finished his work?

805
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:56,660
Oh gosh!

806
00:53:56,750 --> 00:53:59,160
Is he doing the postmortem of the judge?

807
00:54:00,750 --> 00:54:02,330
Are you cutting the fish?

808
00:54:02,750 --> 00:54:04,330
Oops!

809
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:07,910
What is he doing?

810
00:54:16,410 --> 00:54:17,740
Oh gosh!

811
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:25,740
Gun...!

812
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:27,410
You sinner!

813
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:29,740
I have seen curry
made with the vegetables.

814
00:54:29,830 --> 00:54:32,660
But today only I am seeing
the weapons inside the vegetables.

815
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:34,080
I will cut you off.

816
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:39,740
Sir..

817
00:54:39,830 --> 00:54:41,330
- Dear..
- What?

818
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:45,660
- Can you postpone your program me for two days?
- Why?

819
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:48,410
- Because, today is Saturday.
- So...?

820
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:52,660
- The corpse will be impervious to go alone on a Saturday.
- Don't worry!

821
00:54:52,750 --> 00:54:54,580
- You won't go along with the corpse.
- Not that..

822
00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:56,660
You could shoot at dawn.

823
00:54:56,750 --> 00:54:59,240
- What bothers you, if I shoot in dark?
- If you shoot in dark..

824
00:54:59,330 --> 00:55:00,990
It is very silent..

825
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:03,410
The sound will come, if you shoot.

826
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:04,490
Sound won't come.

827
00:55:04,580 --> 00:55:06,660
I have fixed the silencer with this
the sound won't come.

828
00:55:06,750 --> 00:55:08,330
Won't the sound come?

829
00:55:08,410 --> 00:55:10,660
Come and show
the way to judge's room.

830
00:55:10,750 --> 00:55:11,990
Should I show you...?

831
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:13,740
- Else, will your grandpa show me?
- Dear...!

832
00:55:13,830 --> 00:55:16,660
Don't you come with a map,
with those plans?

833
00:55:16,750 --> 00:55:18,910
Uncle, you are my map.
Go!

834
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,660
Should I...?

835
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:22,660
Fate is playing with me.

836
00:55:22,750 --> 00:55:25,160
- It is the way to the exit.
- Is it the exit? -Go this way.

837
00:55:25,250 --> 00:55:28,740
I have forgotten the routes
in this house, after joining you.

838
00:55:28,830 --> 00:55:31,740
- Come, we will go by guessing.
- Go!

839
00:55:34,750 --> 00:55:36,740
Oh gosh!
I am shivering.

840
00:55:39,250 --> 00:55:41,490
- What is this?
- Just for a grip.

841
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:43,910
Dear, think well and tell.

842
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,830
Do you definitely want to finish judge?

843
00:55:45,910 --> 00:55:48,080
- Muruga...!
- So, here are the steps.

844
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:50,160
If you go through this way...

845
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:52,160
The last room is judge's room.

846
00:55:52,410 --> 00:55:53,410
One minute!

847
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:55,410
- Don't knock the first room.
- Why?

848
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:57,990
His mother would be sleeping there
with full makeup.

849
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:00,580
If you wake her up..

850
00:56:00,660 --> 00:56:01,740
- Oh gosh!
- You..

851
00:56:01,830 --> 00:56:04,740
- She will yell like this and put you in trouble..
- Ok!

852
00:56:04,830 --> 00:56:08,490
Then, wait here till I return
and pray to Murugan!

853
00:56:08,580 --> 00:56:11,660
Should I say?
Oh gosh!

854
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:13,580
Muruga! Oh my god!

855
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:14,660
Oh gosh!

856
00:56:14,750 --> 00:56:17,740
He made me blabber like
Avvaiyar(poet) in the midnight.

857
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:46,080
- Oh gosh!
- What?

858
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:47,990
I am working with you thinking that..

859
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:49,580
...that you alone have
come to finish judge.

860
00:56:49,660 --> 00:56:52,490
- Can't you tell that you've brought a group with you?
- What are you blabbering?

861
00:56:52,580 --> 00:56:55,580
I am not blabbering.
One has come with a gun like you.

862
00:56:55,660 --> 00:56:59,660
- Where?
- Look, he is coming.

863
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:07,330
Oh my god!

864
00:57:18,870 --> 00:57:20,790
Now I got the signal clearly..

865
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:22,200
Oops!

866
00:57:22,790 --> 00:57:25,040
Are you in upstairs?

867
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:27,200
Not in upstairs.
She is standing on me..

868
00:57:27,290 --> 00:57:29,540
Voice is very nice.
I think it is cross talk.

869
00:57:29,620 --> 00:57:32,120
- Shall you disconnect?
- First you disconnect.

870
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:34,450
I will see, who is he?
To this side..

871
00:57:34,540 --> 00:57:36,120
Turn to this side.

872
00:57:40,870 --> 00:57:42,540
Why is it bright?

873
00:57:42,620 --> 00:57:44,450
Who has switched on the light?

874
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:46,120
Oh gosh! Judge..

875
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:49,200
Oh gosh!
I too have to start to act.

876
00:57:49,620 --> 00:57:52,370
What is the sound over there?

877
00:57:52,790 --> 00:57:53,790
What happened?

878
00:57:57,950 --> 00:57:59,200
Why are you crying?

879
00:57:59,790 --> 00:58:02,540
Ishu has called from Canada..

880
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:04,120
The signal was weak..

881
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:07,580
To get the signal I have stepped
upstairs by keeping the phone like this,

882
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:10,040
Stop it..
I will continue.

883
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:11,660
She has come like this
with phone in her hand..

884
00:58:11,750 --> 00:58:15,160
...and she looked like a killer to my
eyes with the gun in his hand.

885
00:58:15,250 --> 00:58:16,160
Then, continue..

886
00:58:16,250 --> 00:58:19,580
- He put this cloth on me like this..
- Stop!

887
00:58:19,660 --> 00:58:23,580
I thought that the murderer will be strong,
if visible. That's why.. Go ahead.

888
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:26,830
- Then, he has hugged me..
- I didn't hug her..

889
00:58:26,910 --> 00:58:30,240
I tried to hug the killer but
I hugged her.. Go ahead.

890
00:58:30,330 --> 00:58:35,490
And we fought each other
by rolling down from the upstairs.

891
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:36,490
Then...?

892
00:58:36,580 --> 00:58:39,580
I realised that
the gun was a phone..

893
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:42,160
...and the criminal as her
after switching on the light.

894
00:58:42,250 --> 00:58:43,580
Fine!

895
00:58:43,660 --> 00:58:46,910
Why have you called
at midnight 12'o clock?

896
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,740
You are a matured girl too..

897
00:58:48,830 --> 00:58:51,410
I told you that you shouldn't use
the phone often, isn't it?

898
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:55,330
Cell phone and Internet are only to
improve our knowledge, not to spoil us.

899
00:58:55,410 --> 00:58:56,580
Did you understand?

900
00:58:56,660 --> 00:58:58,240
- Go to bed.
- Come!

901
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:03,160
- Ok, why have you...?
- Go! Everybody.

902
00:59:03,330 --> 00:59:04,160
What is meant by everybody?

903
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:07,080
- Which means that we all have to run off from this place.
- Is it?

904
00:59:07,250 --> 00:59:08,410
- Sir!
- Come up!

905
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:10,160
- Yes, sir!
- Whom is he calling?

906
00:59:10,250 --> 00:59:11,740
Is it he?

907
00:59:11,830 --> 00:59:12,830
He has caught.

908
00:59:12,910 --> 00:59:15,490
It was not wrong that you
have hugged someone by mistake.

909
00:59:15,580 --> 00:59:17,740
But why did you come
upstairs at this hour?

910
00:59:17,830 --> 00:59:20,490
- He is catching the point.
- Uncle, shall I tell him?

911
00:59:20,580 --> 00:59:23,330
- Why is he asking me?
- Tell man!

912
00:59:23,410 --> 00:59:24,830
Uncle only has sent me.

913
00:59:24,910 --> 00:59:25,830
For what?

914
00:59:25,910 --> 00:59:28,080
Ask him like that.

915
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:29,410
That is..

916
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:33,160
He told me to bring the
left over of your wine bottle..

917
00:59:33,250 --> 00:59:36,580
...-from the fridge upstairs without your knowledge.
- Oh gosh!

918
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:40,580
- I came. But I got caught.
- You fool!

919
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:42,080
Uncle, he means you.

920
00:59:42,330 --> 00:59:43,240
Sir!

921
00:59:43,330 --> 00:59:45,330
- You mad!
- Sir...!

922
00:59:47,410 --> 00:59:48,990
It was not wrong that you want to booze.

923
00:59:49,250 --> 00:59:52,330
- But you booze with your own money.
- Sir...!

924
00:59:53,250 --> 00:59:55,660
Your kin is smarter than you.

925
00:59:55,830 --> 00:59:58,410
Henceforth you do what he says.

926
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:00,660
- Ok, sir!
- Go!

927
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:06,740
Oh gosh! Head!

928
01:00:07,410 --> 01:00:09,740
- Did you fry it?
- Not yet.

929
01:00:09,830 --> 01:00:12,240
- Will you fry it tomorrow?
- Definitely!

930
01:00:12,330 --> 01:00:14,740
- If you fry it, the head is for me.
- Ok!

931
01:00:15,750 --> 01:00:16,830
Dear!

932
01:00:16,910 --> 01:00:18,740
Why does he want judge's head?

933
01:00:18,830 --> 01:00:21,410
He has talked about the fish! You damn!

934
01:00:26,620 --> 01:00:29,700
- You sinner! You have killed..
- Mom..

935
01:00:29,870 --> 01:00:32,870
That sinner has killed brutally.

936
01:00:32,950 --> 01:00:35,370
You have killed him and
made him a dead body..

937
01:00:35,450 --> 01:00:39,040
...-and you are developing your body here.
- You useless fellow..

938
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:41,370
- Wait, madam!
- Come out, see what am I going to do to you.

939
01:00:41,450 --> 01:00:46,040
- Madam!
- Your kin has killed cruelly.

940
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:48,950
Oh gosh! I didn't know anything.

941
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:50,950
Madam, you super star!

942
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:54,700
- I have no connection in this. Please don't put me in trouble.
- Get lost!

943
01:00:58,540 --> 01:01:02,950
Madam, he is running good.
Then why are you crying?

944
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:04,200
Oh gosh!

945
01:01:04,290 --> 01:01:07,040
Why should I cry for him?

946
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:08,870
- Then, for what?
- Dog, man.

947
01:01:08,950 --> 01:01:11,540
I am a dog!
I am a dog for you madam.

948
01:01:11,620 --> 01:01:14,200
Demon! You didn't see the dog.
Look there!

949
01:01:15,620 --> 01:01:16,870
Is it that dog?

950
01:01:16,950 --> 01:01:19,370
He won't kill the dog like this.

951
01:01:19,450 --> 01:01:21,450
I was doing yoga upstairs..

952
01:01:21,540 --> 01:01:23,450
He only kept milk to the dog.

953
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:27,700
- It has died off after an hour.
- Oops! It is not dead.

954
01:01:27,790 --> 01:01:30,120
It is sleeping after drinking the milk.

955
01:01:30,450 --> 01:01:31,620
Look, it is breathing.

956
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:34,370
Didn't I tell that he is a good man?
Look, it is waking up.

957
01:01:34,450 --> 01:01:35,700
That is nothing..

958
01:01:35,790 --> 01:01:37,540
It was barking the whole night..

959
01:01:37,620 --> 01:01:39,620
That's why I poured
some spicy milk.

960
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:42,290
- For that too...?
- Spicy milk? What does it mean?

961
01:01:42,370 --> 01:01:45,370
The milk with pepper and cumin,
which is good for the throat.

962
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:47,870
- You will be prosperous.
- It's ok!

963
01:01:47,950 --> 01:01:50,040
I wonder whether
he will stay here or not.

964
01:01:50,450 --> 01:01:51,450
- You have to stay here.
- Ok!

965
01:01:51,540 --> 01:01:54,700
- Only then the house will be safe.
- Ok!

966
01:01:54,790 --> 01:01:57,700
He has befriended them somehow.

967
01:01:58,700 --> 01:02:01,290
Will he finish me before the judge?

968
01:02:02,950 --> 01:02:04,700
A small question.

969
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:08,790
There was a reason when
you gave me spicy milk.

970
01:02:08,870 --> 01:02:11,620
Today, why did you give
spicy milk to the dog?

971
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:13,370
My gun got stuck with it.

972
01:02:13,450 --> 01:02:14,620
It barked when I tried
to take out the gun.

973
01:02:14,700 --> 01:02:16,120
I have made it a fool like you.

974
01:02:17,620 --> 01:02:19,620
- Brother!
- If you fry it, the head is for me.

975
01:02:19,700 --> 01:02:22,870
- Ok, brother!
- First, if you shoot him, his head is for me.

976
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:24,200
He is coming back.

977
01:02:24,370 --> 01:02:25,540
He is coming back in a short time.

978
01:02:26,250 --> 01:02:27,700
We will keep it in kitchen
it will be safe there.

979
01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:29,790
Come.
Come fast.

980
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:31,080
What happened?

981
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:33,080
Why are you running
as if an earthquake has come?

982
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:34,290
We have to hide these
in a secret place.

983
01:02:34,370 --> 01:02:36,790
- For what?
- That foreign spook has returned.

984
01:02:36,870 --> 01:02:38,450
It'll eat everything
without leaving anything.

985
01:02:38,660 --> 01:02:40,040
Has the foreign spook returned?

986
01:02:40,540 --> 01:02:44,040
This is the moon which has come then.

987
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:47,620
That is the moon which has come now.

988
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:51,160
Always only one moon is there.

989
01:02:51,290 --> 01:02:59,290
Same moon appears to both our eyes

990
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:03,700
This is the moon which has come then.

991
01:03:03,870 --> 01:03:07,370
That is the moon which has come now.

992
01:03:07,540 --> 01:03:10,950
Always only one moon is there.

993
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:19,040
Same moon appears to both our eyes

994
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:22,620
Kuppusami! You've Iearnt to sing very
well after returning from abroad.

995
01:03:22,700 --> 01:03:24,910
My name is I lay am a an, not Kuppusami

996
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:27,700
Why that name I lay am a an (maan-deer)?
Is it a kind of deer?

997
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:32,160
I picked I I a ya from Ilayaraja
and maan from Rahman.

998
01:03:32,250 --> 01:03:33,700
And joined together as I lay am a an.

999
01:03:33,790 --> 01:03:36,410
Dear! There is no use
changing your name.

1000
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:38,700
I also joined with you, didn't I?
Change your tune.

1001
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:43,790
Hey! It's killing me.

1002
01:03:45,290 --> 01:03:47,790
Your beauty is mesmerising me.

1003
01:03:49,290 --> 01:03:51,870
The world is shrinking

1004
01:03:53,370 --> 01:03:56,330
Only two of us prevail

1005
01:03:56,660 --> 01:04:02,790
When I walk along with you,
every moment becomes..

1006
01:04:04,910 --> 01:04:05,910
Why did you laugh?

1007
01:04:06,250 --> 01:04:08,660
The tune is not good in your song.

1008
01:04:08,790 --> 01:04:12,370
- The tune? Who are you?
- Dear! He is my kin.

1009
01:04:12,450 --> 01:04:14,080
- What kin, dear?
- Dear! He is my assistant.

1010
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:16,490
He is a cook.
What does he know about the tune?

1011
01:04:16,580 --> 01:04:17,620
You say a single word
that you don't like him.

1012
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:18,540
I'll send him out the moment.

1013
01:04:18,750 --> 01:04:20,790
- I don't like.
- He doesn't like you.. You start.

1014
01:04:20,870 --> 01:04:22,660
- Why?
- I don't like his laughing.

1015
01:04:22,750 --> 01:04:24,620
- What is this?
- Are you talking about the tune?

1016
01:04:24,790 --> 01:04:26,040
Are you telling me about the music?

1017
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:27,740
Do you know what this is?
It's a guitar. Hold it

1018
01:04:27,790 --> 01:04:28,700
You sing a song.
Let me hear it.

1019
01:04:28,790 --> 01:04:31,080
- Dear! You also join in the list.
- I don't bother about the list.

1020
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,790
If he doesn't sing now, I'll tell
the judge and make him get out.

1021
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:35,490
It's not possible to stop
your ill-fortune.

1022
01:04:35,620 --> 01:04:37,540
- What ill-fortune?
- I meant to say that he is going to sing.

1023
01:04:37,620 --> 01:04:40,120
Come what may, ask him to sing.
Else he will get out.

1024
01:04:40,290 --> 01:04:44,240
If I order something..

1025
01:04:45,330 --> 01:04:46,240
He is acting superb.

1026
01:04:46,330 --> 01:04:50,200
- If it happens..
- Correct.

1027
01:04:50,950 --> 01:04:51,950
The same turning..

1028
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:55,790
If I order something..
If it happens..

1029
01:04:55,950 --> 01:04:59,700
This poor people won't suffer.

1030
01:04:59,790 --> 01:05:03,330
Until I am alive..
None need to suffer..

1031
01:05:03,540 --> 01:05:11,540
I won't let them cry..

1032
01:05:12,370 --> 01:05:14,790
Judge has come for a good song
Run away

1033
01:05:14,830 --> 01:05:17,450
- Why are they all running?
- Judge uncle has come.

1034
01:05:18,870 --> 01:05:22,200
- Who is it?
- It is me uncle. -Get up

1035
01:05:23,290 --> 01:05:25,370
- When did you return from abroad?
- Today morning.

1036
01:05:25,910 --> 01:05:27,830
Why did you fall at my feet, in law?

1037
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:30,290
It is only for this
relationship to happen.

1038
01:05:31,620 --> 01:05:35,080
Whatever the people in this house say,
you'll be the groom for my Thara.

1039
01:05:35,290 --> 01:05:36,830
- Thank you uncle.
- Come.

1040
01:05:39,660 --> 01:05:40,740
What happened to you, Thara?

1041
01:05:40,790 --> 01:05:42,740
- How can she bear such a shocking news?
- Oh gosh.

1042
01:05:53,290 --> 01:05:55,450
What are you trying to
connect using the wire?

1043
01:05:55,700 --> 01:05:58,290
Not to connect but to disconnect!

1044
01:05:58,700 --> 01:06:00,790
To disconnect?
I don't get anything.

1045
01:06:00,950 --> 01:06:03,160
- Take that.
- Which one? -That one.

1046
01:06:03,620 --> 01:06:04,700
Take it.

1047
01:06:04,790 --> 01:06:06,120
- Take that timer.
- Timer..

1048
01:06:06,290 --> 01:06:08,200
Is it this one? Why?
To set alarm?

1049
01:06:08,410 --> 01:06:10,370
I am here for you as the alarm.
Why do you need this?

1050
01:06:11,450 --> 01:06:12,790
Will you sleep till 8.30?

1051
01:06:13,450 --> 01:06:15,990
Don't you know that judge will go
to Darjeeling at seven in the morning?

1052
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:17,830
That's why they've said that
the vehicle has come.

1053
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:20,950
I am setting up the time bomb
to be planted under the vehicle.

1054
01:06:21,790 --> 01:06:25,240
Bomb? Is it not shooting
only your profession?

1055
01:06:25,540 --> 01:06:26,790
My profession is killing people.

1056
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:30,790
- It is not a matter how to kill.
- It is a fair talk.

1057
01:06:31,660 --> 01:06:34,790
Why did you wear gloves
on your hands as if for an operation?

1058
01:06:35,790 --> 01:06:36,950
My fingerprints will be seen.

1059
01:06:37,790 --> 01:06:39,450
You are a brilliant person.

1060
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:43,620
I was helping you with the things.
Won't my fingerprints be seen?

1061
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:46,580
Shouldn't they know
who planted the bomb?

1062
01:06:46,790 --> 01:06:47,740
Get up and follow me.

1063
01:06:47,790 --> 01:06:50,120
So you're going to place the bomb,
and the blame would fall on me?

1064
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:53,830
Oh gosh!
I would have slept..

1065
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:56,240
But I myself have come
and got into this mess.

1066
01:06:56,910 --> 01:06:58,620
I am waiting here for haif an hour

1067
01:06:58,790 --> 01:06:59,870
- Half an hour ovr?
- What are you blabbering alone?

1068
01:06:59,950 --> 01:07:01,830
- Why do you call me?
- Come.

1069
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:06,490
I'll go under the vehicle.

1070
01:07:06,750 --> 01:07:10,450
You follow me and give a signal
if anyone comes there.

1071
01:07:10,580 --> 01:07:12,370
I'll kill you,
if you mess it up.

1072
01:07:12,500 --> 01:07:13,870
You go dear!

1073
01:07:15,790 --> 01:07:18,370
- Gosh! Why are you coming back?
- Move aside.

1074
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:39,370
From there..

1075
01:07:43,410 --> 01:07:45,740
He is jumping worse than like a monkey.

1076
01:07:46,620 --> 01:07:50,700
If the monkey sees it,
it'll commit suicide.

1077
01:07:52,950 --> 01:07:54,790
It's ok, I'll go and spy

1078
01:07:54,870 --> 01:07:56,990
Some sound has come
from backside of the building.

1079
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:59,620
You go and see there.
Go fast.

1080
01:08:01,700 --> 01:08:03,620
Sir! He is planting the bomb
under the vehicle.

1081
01:08:03,700 --> 01:08:04,700
He has started the work.

1082
01:08:04,750 --> 01:08:06,790
By blaming me,
he is planting the bomb.

1083
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:08,700
Don't know how many people
will die along with the judge?

1084
01:08:09,870 --> 01:08:11,740
- Are you weeing here?
- When did I wee?

1085
01:08:12,700 --> 01:08:14,120
If he comes, tell him
that you didn't see me.

1086
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:17,120
- To whom?
- To that fool I lay am a an

1087
01:08:17,250 --> 01:08:19,290
- I'll hide somewhere.
- Where will you hide?

1088
01:08:19,620 --> 01:08:20,580
I'll go and hide under the bus

1089
01:08:20,660 --> 01:08:22,700
Oh gosh! This lunatic is going
to hide there.

1090
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:26,700
Oh gosh! She also has gone inside.

1091
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:28,120
What are you doing here?

1092
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:30,990
He'll come and hit in my mouth
that I've sent her there

1093
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:32,700
Judge is going tomorrow.

1094
01:08:32,750 --> 01:08:34,950
They said that
he wanted mutton leg soup.

1095
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:36,490
My uncle doesn't know
to prepare that.

1096
01:08:36,620 --> 01:08:38,660
He is torturing me to prepare it.

1097
01:08:38,700 --> 01:08:41,660
He doesn't leave me even if I tell him that
I am wearing gloves to my injured hands

1098
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:43,700
So I ran outside and saw this.

1099
01:08:43,830 --> 01:08:46,790
I hid under this and got caught by you.

1100
01:08:46,910 --> 01:08:48,950
- You don't worry. I'll save you. Ok?
- Ok.

1101
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:51,790
It has been a long time.
What are they doing inside?

1102
01:08:54,250 --> 01:08:56,040
Who is it?
Is it you?

1103
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:57,370
- Has she come?
- Who is it?

1104
01:08:57,700 --> 01:08:58,740
My would-be Tara.

1105
01:08:58,830 --> 01:09:00,450
Yes, she came.
No, she hasn't come.

1106
01:09:00,540 --> 01:09:01,410
Did she come or not?

1107
01:09:01,540 --> 01:09:02,790
- She came.
- Then where has she gone?

1108
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:06,120
By going straight,
she went that way.

1109
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:07,620
Why did she go that way
after going straight?

1110
01:09:07,700 --> 01:09:09,660
Don't know what trouble she has,
she went that way.

1111
01:09:09,700 --> 01:09:11,700
- She should have gone straight.
- She didn't go.

1112
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,290
What man?

1113
01:09:18,580 --> 01:09:21,160
- Why haven't you yelled yet?
- Why should I yell?

1114
01:09:21,370 --> 01:09:23,830
- Is there no one inside?
- No one is there.

1115
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,580
- Where would he have gone?
- Whom are you looking for?

1116
01:09:26,830 --> 01:09:28,700
I am looking for my kin.

1117
01:09:28,790 --> 01:09:30,990
It's ok, I'll go and see that side.

1118
01:09:33,450 --> 01:09:34,740
Kin!

1119
01:09:35,700 --> 01:09:37,700
Why are you appearing in both sides?

1120
01:09:37,750 --> 01:09:40,660
- You also appear on both sides.
- I've come around the bus.

1121
01:09:40,700 --> 01:09:41,870
I came by rolling

1122
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:44,410
- With whom are you talking?
- I am talking to myself. Who is it?

1123
01:09:44,700 --> 01:09:46,700
- As usual?
- Is it you?

1124
01:09:46,830 --> 01:09:51,370
- Have you seen that rascal when you were looking for her?
- Which rascal?

1125
01:09:51,450 --> 01:09:55,490
That rascal and idiot of my kin
who is torturing me.

1126
01:09:55,580 --> 01:09:56,790
You are looking for your kin.

1127
01:09:56,870 --> 01:10:00,160
- But I am looking for my would-be.
- Why are you looking for her?

1128
01:10:00,450 --> 01:10:01,740
To show my intelligence.

1129
01:10:02,370 --> 01:10:07,620
You idiot, rascal! Isn't there any time
to show your intelligence?

1130
01:10:07,700 --> 01:10:10,290
- Who are you scolding?
- I am scolding my kin.

1131
01:10:10,450 --> 01:10:12,620
Have you heard that
how your uncle is scolding you?

1132
01:10:12,700 --> 01:10:14,700
It's ok. Still he is my uncle.

1133
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:18,620
I composed a duet song and
I wanted to play to her..

1134
01:10:18,700 --> 01:10:19,700
- But she is escaping from me.
- It's ok.

1135
01:10:19,790 --> 01:10:21,040
Leave today and
show it her tomorrow.

1136
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:23,580
- Leave her but you must hear it.
- Oh gosh.

1137
01:10:54,410 --> 01:10:55,740
- What sound is this?
- Oh gosh!

1138
01:10:55,830 --> 01:10:58,240
Judge uncle! They are alerted.
Dear!

1139
01:10:58,700 --> 01:10:59,870
- Hey!
- What?

1140
01:10:59,950 --> 01:11:00,990
Where were you doing for so long?

1141
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:02,660
- I was inside.
- What were you doing?

1142
01:11:02,750 --> 01:11:03,830
- I was setting up.
- Which one?

1143
01:11:03,950 --> 01:11:06,490
-The bomb
-Did you set it up?

1144
01:11:06,870 --> 01:11:08,490
At which gap you did it?

1145
01:11:08,620 --> 01:11:12,580
You idiot, rascal!
Why do you bother about it?

1146
01:11:12,700 --> 01:11:14,740
See tomorrow that
who is going to be killed.

1147
01:11:14,830 --> 01:11:16,790
Shall we go?
Come.

1148
01:11:19,660 --> 01:11:20,990
He has set it up.

1149
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:24,700
I'll watch the blast tomorrow
from a long distance.

1150
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:32,870
Gosh! Everyone is going to die.

1151
01:11:33,660 --> 01:11:34,540
Why do you get scared now?

1152
01:11:34,660 --> 01:11:37,080
- It's going to blast at 8.30 only.
- The time is not important.

1153
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:38,830
How many people
would die is important!

1154
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:43,290
Come and see that queue.

1155
01:11:44,660 --> 01:11:45,700
Look there!

1156
01:11:49,660 --> 01:11:51,870
Every member of this house
is getting inside the bus.

1157
01:11:51,950 --> 01:11:54,660
- What sin did they do?
- Give the seat to him.

1158
01:11:55,830 --> 01:11:59,540
See! You've become sad
after seeing them all

1159
01:12:00,830 --> 01:12:03,120
You were looking sad but
you brightened up suddenly.

1160
01:12:03,330 --> 01:12:04,740
See, the Judge!

1161
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:06,910
Are you feeling happy
that he is going to get inside?

1162
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:08,660
Entire family is going there

1163
01:12:08,830 --> 01:12:10,740
It is his fate that he wants
to die along with his family.

1164
01:12:10,830 --> 01:12:13,830
- How can you be so cool at such an atrocious matter?
- Get in.

1165
01:12:14,500 --> 01:12:16,240
Do you want to bring this
to Darjeeling to play there?

1166
01:12:16,330 --> 01:12:20,330
- Yes.
- Gosh! We'll feel our heads would explode after hearing that

1167
01:12:20,830 --> 01:12:23,830
Wherever I go, my life and
death are with these only.

1168
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:26,240
It is said that everything will
become known before death.

1169
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:28,870
It is known to all the people.

1170
01:12:29,580 --> 01:12:31,700
Where is Banerji?
He is not seen.

1171
01:12:31,870 --> 01:12:34,990
- Why are they searching me?
- He is here, grandma.

1172
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:37,080
Are you planning to kill me?
It won't happen.

1173
01:12:37,250 --> 01:12:40,410
I am not here. Oh gosh!
I have shown up myself.

1174
01:12:40,830 --> 01:12:42,330
Grandma! I'll bring him.

1175
01:12:42,410 --> 01:12:44,700
See, I won't come.

1176
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,330
- Oh gosh! Leave me.
- Be silent.

1177
01:12:48,410 --> 01:12:49,370
You took everything, isn't it?

1178
01:12:49,450 --> 01:12:52,620
Grandma! Didn't you call him
to take him with you?

1179
01:12:53,500 --> 01:12:55,240
Banerji! You too come with us.

1180
01:12:55,410 --> 01:12:57,830
Didn't you call me to take with you?

1181
01:12:57,950 --> 01:12:59,830
Is it your plan?

1182
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:03,240
She called you to ask if
you've packed the spices correctly?

1183
01:13:03,410 --> 01:13:05,620
- Did you pack it up?
- I did it.

1184
01:13:05,830 --> 01:13:06,990
You could have told it when I was there.

1185
01:13:07,160 --> 01:13:07,990
Do you want me to
ask by calling here?

1186
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:10,080
- What dear?
- Catch him. -Oh gosh!

1187
01:13:10,830 --> 01:13:11,830
Madam is calling you.

1188
01:13:12,250 --> 01:13:14,700
You are always with us.
Come, let's go together.

1189
01:13:14,830 --> 01:13:19,830
How can we always
go everywhere together?

1190
01:13:19,910 --> 01:13:22,830
There will be someone for cooking.
We need a person to serve that.

1191
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,950
- No chance.
- The food will be delicious.

1192
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:28,790
- Everything goes non sync.
- Get into the vehicle.

1193
01:13:28,830 --> 01:13:32,080
- Sir! I haven't packed my luggage yet.
- I already have packed it.

1194
01:13:32,830 --> 01:13:34,740
Were you packing my dresses?

1195
01:13:34,830 --> 01:13:37,910
-No, your dresses only are there
-Why do you make such a big plan?

1196
01:13:38,120 --> 01:13:39,740
- Sir! It is burning.
- What?

1197
01:13:39,830 --> 01:13:42,830
Inside milk, no butter milk,
no murder, no... oven!

1198
01:13:42,950 --> 01:13:45,580
After finishing everything
I'll reach by a bus or a lorry.

1199
01:13:45,660 --> 01:13:48,740
- You go sir.
- Your kin will take care of that.

1200
01:13:48,830 --> 01:13:51,830
-He is more brilliant than you
-I know that.

1201
01:13:51,950 --> 01:13:55,830
- Go and return happily.
- No return. -Don't cry.

1202
01:13:58,790 --> 01:13:59,870
Police!

1203
01:14:00,950 --> 01:14:03,370
If I leave it,
I won't get another chance.

1204
01:14:05,830 --> 01:14:07,040
There was an accident on the way.

1205
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:09,580
No problem. They have made
all arrangements correctly.

1206
01:14:09,660 --> 01:14:11,830
You would have gone,
if I had come a little late.

1207
01:14:11,950 --> 01:14:14,700
- Now too.
- Why are you standing here?

1208
01:14:14,790 --> 01:14:16,240
- Go inside.
- Thank God!

1209
01:14:16,450 --> 01:14:18,700
He asked you to go inside the bus.

1210
01:14:18,790 --> 01:14:20,330
Are you also going with them?

1211
01:14:20,870 --> 01:14:22,240
You are there now too..

1212
01:14:22,450 --> 01:14:25,450
- I forgot water can. Go, bring it.
- I'll bring it.

1213
01:14:25,660 --> 01:14:27,790
Security! Come here.

1214
01:14:27,870 --> 01:14:29,200
Have you checked the vehicle thoroughly?

1215
01:14:29,290 --> 01:14:31,080
I've checked the vehicle
thoroughly in the morning.

1216
01:14:31,790 --> 01:14:33,490
Bombs are being blasted
because people like him are there.

1217
01:14:39,700 --> 01:14:40,540
What?

1218
01:14:41,870 --> 01:14:43,870
- He is the commissioner.
- I know. That's why I am calling him.

1219
01:14:46,870 --> 01:14:47,990
Come sir.

1220
01:14:49,830 --> 01:14:51,120
Where do you call me alone?

1221
01:14:51,250 --> 01:14:53,910
I am in a critical position.

1222
01:14:54,660 --> 01:14:56,790
Neither I can disclose
nor I can hide it.

1223
01:14:56,870 --> 01:14:57,790
Don't hide.
Disclose it.

1224
01:14:57,870 --> 01:15:00,160
I'll tell it.
Let's keep it between us.

1225
01:15:00,290 --> 01:15:04,200
Don't tell anyone what I told you.
Here is..

1226
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,740
Muruga! It is very heavy.

1227
01:15:07,870 --> 01:15:09,200
You started to tell something.
Why did you stop in the middle?

1228
01:15:09,290 --> 01:15:11,910
Did I tell something...?
I should change the topic..

1229
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:16,450
Sir! I feel very hungry.
Give me 10 rupees.

1230
01:15:16,540 --> 01:15:17,870
Fie! He is spitting on my hands.

1231
01:15:17,910 --> 01:15:19,450
How dare you call a
commissioner for this?

1232
01:15:19,540 --> 01:15:20,950
- Leave it.
- You're calling me like calling a girl.

1233
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:22,540
- You are our man, isn't it?
- Take it.

1234
01:15:22,750 --> 01:15:25,330
I'll slap you. Go.

1235
01:15:26,290 --> 01:15:30,370
Pray to God that the vehicle
should reach safely.

1236
01:15:30,660 --> 01:15:33,990
Hey Lord Govind!

1237
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:36,700
It is a good omen to start.

1238
01:15:42,870 --> 01:15:47,200
Is the time 8.30?
It has blasted.

1239
01:15:47,290 --> 01:15:49,200
They are clapping their hands
after it gets blasted!

1240
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:53,330
They are showing movies
where bombs explode.

1241
01:15:53,410 --> 01:15:55,580
Why don't you play a devotional movie?

1242
01:15:55,750 --> 01:15:57,540
Are we going on a pilgrimage
to play a devotional movie?

1243
01:15:57,620 --> 01:16:00,870
- Keep quiet and come.
- This glutton is not hearing my words.

1244
01:16:02,830 --> 01:16:05,410
God! You've made the man
who planted the bomb to remove it.

1245
01:16:05,700 --> 01:16:06,830
You are so kind.

1246
01:16:07,580 --> 01:16:09,660
Stop the vehicle.
They are asking to stop the vehicle.

1247
01:16:09,870 --> 01:16:11,870
Police officer asks us
to stop the vehicle.

1248
01:16:12,660 --> 01:16:13,870
- Stop the TV.
- Thank god!

1249
01:16:14,330 --> 01:16:15,910
- Come in.
- What commissioner?

1250
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,790
- Why did you ask to stop the vehicle?
- Because of this lunatic Banerji.

1251
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:21,700
- Is it me?
- His buddy Murugan has told it.

1252
01:16:21,790 --> 01:16:23,290
He only planted that.

1253
01:16:23,790 --> 01:16:25,120
You forgot the muffler in the house.
Was it you or him?

1254
01:16:25,250 --> 01:16:28,040
- Muffler?
- You are always with them.

1255
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:29,040
Aren't you suppose to
remind them about it?

1256
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:31,120
Haven't you come to take out
which has been kept?

1257
01:16:31,410 --> 01:16:32,870
- What has been kept?
- That is..

1258
01:16:35,910 --> 01:16:38,290
- You come here.
- Muruga! It is ready.

1259
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:42,040
Fine, what was kept?
Tell me, what was kept?

1260
01:16:42,160 --> 01:16:44,410
I asked you if you have
got the things that I forgot

1261
01:16:44,540 --> 01:16:46,540
- I've brought it.
- You go man.

1262
01:16:46,870 --> 01:16:48,580
- Take this grandma.
- Thank you very much.

1263
01:16:48,750 --> 01:16:49,790
- It's ok.
- It is a very cold place.

1264
01:16:49,870 --> 01:16:52,120
Without these I would've got finished.

1265
01:16:52,870 --> 01:16:54,870
Anyhow it is going to happen

1266
01:16:54,950 --> 01:16:56,870
Let your enquiry go well.

1267
01:16:58,620 --> 01:17:00,540
- He has gone.
- Uncle! Reach there safely.

1268
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:02,950
- Reach all of you safely.
- You too come with us.

1269
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:05,790
Yes, call him too.
He'll be helpful to us.

1270
01:17:05,870 --> 01:17:06,990
Come, let's go together.

1271
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:09,620
Gosh! There are many
things pending at home.

1272
01:17:09,750 --> 01:17:11,540
Forget about all that.
You come with us.

1273
01:17:11,790 --> 01:17:12,910
You haven't seen Darjeeling,
have you? Come.

1274
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:15,330
I'll go alone to Darjeeling.
There is no place for me.

1275
01:17:15,580 --> 01:17:16,790
I'll give you my place.
You come.

1276
01:17:16,870 --> 01:17:17,910
You tell him.
Then only he'll come.

1277
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,790
Yes, you too come with us.

1278
01:17:20,870 --> 01:17:22,200
If you come,
it'll be very joyful. Come.

1279
01:17:22,580 --> 01:17:23,700
I won't come.
Leave me.

1280
01:17:23,790 --> 01:17:25,540
- Sir! He'll listen to you only.
- Hey, go inside.

1281
01:17:25,700 --> 01:17:27,870
- See! Sir asked you to come.
- Ok. -Come.

1282
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:31,790
- Let's go together.
- Leave my hand.

1283
01:17:40,120 --> 01:17:42,450
What is this?
Has your fear gone?

1284
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:45,830
Why should I fear when you are
also going to die along with us?

1285
01:17:45,870 --> 01:17:48,830
There is no work for them.
They are watching matching scenes only.

1286
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:53,120
Look dear! Nothing has happened now.

1287
01:17:53,410 --> 01:17:58,700
- I give you a last chance.
- To me? You!

1288
01:17:59,370 --> 01:18:02,120
If you want to be alive,
scream and stop the bus.

1289
01:18:02,540 --> 01:18:07,120
...remove the bomb which is
under the bus and run away.

1290
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:09,870
- I don't worry about my life.
- Then?

1291
01:18:10,660 --> 01:18:11,910
I want his life only.

1292
01:18:12,870 --> 01:18:14,450
What is the time now?

1293
01:18:14,870 --> 01:18:17,540
- It is 8.30.
- 8.30?

1294
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:29,790
What is this?

1295
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:34,790
It is very foggy as seen in the movies

1296
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:38,740
Have I reached the heaven?

1297
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:44,200
Who are they?
Is it our gang?

1298
01:18:44,540 --> 01:18:47,410
Even in heaven they are
roaming as same pairs.

1299
01:18:47,540 --> 01:18:50,450
Who is she?
It is our madam.

1300
01:18:50,580 --> 01:18:52,990
She is roaming with
the makeup here too!

1301
01:18:54,160 --> 01:18:55,540
Who is it?

1302
01:18:56,290 --> 01:18:57,870
It is him.

1303
01:18:59,370 --> 01:19:01,740
Someone give a chance
to him at least here

1304
01:19:01,830 --> 01:19:03,330
How are you uncle?

1305
01:19:03,830 --> 01:19:05,660
I am still lying down.

1306
01:19:05,870 --> 01:19:07,790
I've tried very much to save you.

1307
01:19:07,870 --> 01:19:09,410
We thought that you are unconscious..

1308
01:19:09,540 --> 01:19:11,240
...but finally you've gone mad.

1309
01:19:11,330 --> 01:19:12,790
What are you blabbering dear?

1310
01:19:12,870 --> 01:19:14,580
We are not blabbering but you

1311
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:17,620
- It's better, that he gained consciousness.
- Unconscious?

1312
01:19:17,700 --> 01:19:19,370
You have been
unconscious since morning.

1313
01:19:19,870 --> 01:19:22,870
- Didn't I die in the explosion?
- Will anyone die in a tyre blast?

1314
01:19:22,910 --> 01:19:24,200
Did the tyre blast off?

1315
01:19:24,330 --> 01:19:26,910
- Isn't it the heaven then?
- No, it is Darjeeling.

1316
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:28,740
- Get up.
- Oops!

1317
01:19:28,830 --> 01:19:30,450
Sir car has come.
Go away.

1318
01:19:30,540 --> 01:19:32,740
Gosh! Uncle has come.
Run away.

1319
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,950
Fine! What happened to the bomb?

1320
01:19:35,330 --> 01:19:37,620
I removed the bomb
while changing the tyre.

1321
01:19:38,370 --> 01:19:39,200
Why dear?

1322
01:19:39,450 --> 01:19:40,870
I was in the bus.
That's why.

1323
01:19:40,950 --> 01:19:43,950
I've to be alive to achieve a lot.

1324
01:19:44,700 --> 01:19:46,290
Henceforth it won't
get blasted, will it?

1325
01:19:46,540 --> 01:19:48,740
No one knows when
and how it would blast.

1326
01:19:48,870 --> 01:19:51,290
It'll blast at the right moment.

1327
01:19:51,450 --> 01:19:54,870
The judge is going to die in Darjeeling!

1328
01:19:58,870 --> 01:20:01,870
The place where we should go
is 30km far from here, sir.

1329
01:20:01,950 --> 01:20:05,450
The local police will support
our enquiry very much.

1330
01:20:08,290 --> 01:20:09,950
Get up.

1331
01:20:10,870 --> 01:20:13,540
They are tribe people
of the nearby hill.

1332
01:20:13,870 --> 01:20:17,370
More than 20 children
were lost from their gang.

1333
01:20:17,540 --> 01:20:19,790
We got bone skeletons
from the drainage..

1334
01:20:19,870 --> 01:20:23,120
...and after enquiring, we had come to
know that those were their children.

1335
01:20:25,870 --> 01:20:28,040
- What are they telling?
- Wait.

1336
01:20:28,450 --> 01:20:30,540
They are saying that
after you took the enquiry..

1337
01:20:30,620 --> 01:20:33,450
...the number of missing children
has come down.

1338
01:20:37,290 --> 01:20:39,200
What man?
Oh gosh!

1339
01:20:39,450 --> 01:20:41,450
Don't you feel bored?

1340
01:20:41,540 --> 01:20:44,450
All the time you do
something to kill him.

1341
01:20:44,540 --> 01:20:46,790
This is my profession.
I've come for that.

1342
01:20:46,870 --> 01:20:49,450
What is the cell phone,
pad and wires?

1343
01:20:50,120 --> 01:20:51,790
It is a bomb can be activated
by the blue tooth.

1344
01:20:51,870 --> 01:20:53,370
What is blue tooth?

1345
01:20:55,290 --> 01:20:57,290
If I press four buttons
in my cell phone..

1346
01:20:57,370 --> 01:20:59,870
...-this bomb will blast.
- Again with a new invention.

1347
01:20:59,950 --> 01:21:01,450
Ok, where are you
going to plant it?

1348
01:21:01,790 --> 01:21:04,200
- You give me some idea.
- Me?

1349
01:21:04,290 --> 01:21:05,990
Where will the judge stay?

1350
01:21:06,450 --> 01:21:09,040
- Why do you ask me to co-operate?
- For some safety.

1351
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:11,540
- Who is it?
- Mov aside.

1352
01:21:11,660 --> 01:21:12,620
- Muruga! Hold it.
- What is it?

1353
01:21:12,700 --> 01:21:14,120
- Hide this guitar somewhere.
- Ok.

1354
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:16,450
-We can't bear his torture
-Ok.

1355
01:21:16,950 --> 01:21:18,540
It should be hidden away from him.

1356
01:21:18,620 --> 01:21:21,200
- No -Come, let's go.
- I have to throw it into the water.

1357
01:21:21,290 --> 01:21:24,870
- Hey Muruga!
- Oh! She is calling.. -What madam?

1358
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:27,040
See! Whether the signal is coming
or not in your cell phone.

1359
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:28,870
Wait! I'll see.
Hold it.

1360
01:21:30,120 --> 01:21:32,120
Don't tell her
that the signal is coming.

1361
01:21:32,540 --> 01:21:33,870
Yes, it is coming this side.

1362
01:21:33,950 --> 01:21:36,040
- I'll tell you a number. Dial it and give me.
- Ok.

1363
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:44,990
Be careful.
Don't press this number.

1364
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:47,910
It is ringing.

1365
01:21:49,410 --> 01:21:51,660
Who is it talking?

1366
01:21:52,250 --> 01:21:56,160
After completing the talk, if she
presses the number which you've set up..

1367
01:21:56,250 --> 01:21:58,910
...-won't it be blasted?
- Follow me at 10 feet distance. -Why?

1368
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,910
- I've to escape.
- Oh gosh!

1369
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,240
- Tara! Have you seen my guitar?
- Yes, I have.

1370
01:22:04,330 --> 01:22:05,910
- Where?
- In Kolkata.

1371
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,910
I am asking the one
which I brought to Darjeeling.

1372
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,160
I don't know.

1373
01:22:12,660 --> 01:22:15,490
- Throw it.
- Ok, I'll do.

1374
01:22:15,580 --> 01:22:18,830
- Throw it into this.
- Into this?

1375
01:22:18,910 --> 01:22:21,160
It's better if it leaves from me.
Go.

1376
01:22:22,330 --> 01:22:24,160
He is taking too much of a risk.

1377
01:22:34,330 --> 01:22:37,410
- Ever body come here.
- Come.

1378
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:38,580
Come fast.

1379
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:42,830
There is a marriage in their place.
They are inviting us

1380
01:22:42,910 --> 01:22:44,910
- We shall go there with them.
- With them...?

1381
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,580
It will be boring, uncle.
We won't come. Please.

1382
01:22:48,830 --> 01:22:51,330
They are calling us with affection.
We must go there.

1383
01:22:51,410 --> 01:22:53,330
I'll join you after finishing my enquiry.

1384
01:22:53,410 --> 01:22:55,330
We'll have our lunch there.

1385
01:22:56,080 --> 01:23:03,160
Greetings sir!

1386
01:23:41,080 --> 01:23:44,660
Come dear!

1387
01:23:48,410 --> 01:23:52,080
We are tribes! Sing a song!

1388
01:23:52,160 --> 01:23:55,910
Easy! Easy! Love is easy!

1389
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:59,160
Talk and love the girl!

1390
01:24:02,750 --> 01:24:06,830
It is peak of joy!

1391
01:24:06,910 --> 01:24:09,080
Make it grand..
..has kept me here.

1392
01:24:09,160 --> 01:24:10,160
It is a music party!

1393
01:24:10,250 --> 01:24:14,160
Earth quake seems like crackers

1394
01:24:14,250 --> 01:24:21,830
It is glittering when
the turmeric girl comes!

1395
01:24:25,660 --> 01:24:29,160
We are tribes! Sing a song!

1396
01:24:29,250 --> 01:24:33,080
Easy! Easy! Love is easy!

1397
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:36,160
Talk and love the girl!

1398
01:24:36,250 --> 01:24:40,160
It is peak of joy!

1399
01:24:40,250 --> 01:24:42,580
Make it grand.
..has kept me here.

1400
01:24:42,660 --> 01:24:43,830
It is a music party!

1401
01:24:43,910 --> 01:24:47,740
It is a earth quake.

1402
01:24:47,830 --> 01:24:54,160
It is glittering when
the turmeric girl comes!

1403
01:25:36,790 --> 01:25:40,370
Geniuses! Generally women!

1404
01:25:40,450 --> 01:25:44,290
Their minds are pure like jasmine!

1405
01:25:44,370 --> 01:25:48,370
They are children
even if they are old.

1406
01:25:51,700 --> 01:25:55,290
They will advise to
live without a mask.

1407
01:25:55,370 --> 01:25:59,120
That is her nature.

1408
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:02,540
Nothing equals the nature

1409
01:26:02,620 --> 01:26:06,290
Youth returns like a flower bloom.

1410
01:26:06,370 --> 01:26:10,120
You look matured
enough as the flower.

1411
01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:15,370
Oho! Is this a wonderful day?

1412
01:26:21,290 --> 01:26:24,790
We are tribes! Sing a song!

1413
01:26:24,870 --> 01:26:28,540
Easy! Easy! Love is easy!

1414
01:26:28,620 --> 01:26:32,200
Talk and love the girl!

1415
01:26:32,290 --> 01:26:35,540
We are tribes!

1416
01:26:35,870 --> 01:26:39,370
Sing a song!

1417
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:09,700
It is the time to inject comld..

1418
01:27:09,790 --> 01:27:13,290
...into the vein!

1419
01:27:13,370 --> 01:27:16,370
Shivering body does the dance!

1420
01:27:16,450 --> 01:27:20,870
This earth will purify the heart..

1421
01:27:20,950 --> 01:27:24,540
...which is sordid!

1422
01:27:24,620 --> 01:27:28,200
Show me a place like this.

1423
01:27:28,290 --> 01:27:31,870
Throw away the worries
from your heart..

1424
01:27:31,950 --> 01:27:35,450
...which were there till now.

1425
01:27:35,540 --> 01:27:42,870
Won't we feel a new experience?

1426
01:27:46,700 --> 01:27:49,700
We are tribes! Sing a song!

1427
01:27:50,370 --> 01:27:54,120
Easy! Easy! Love is easy!

1428
01:27:54,200 --> 01:27:57,540
Talk and love the girl!

1429
01:28:39,450 --> 01:28:43,450
Gosh! I don't know how
they are going to enquire me.

1430
01:28:43,540 --> 01:28:46,540
My total body is shuddering

1431
01:28:48,540 --> 01:28:50,200
What nephew! Where are you going?

1432
01:28:50,290 --> 01:28:53,450
Uncle! I don't know when
would bombs blast anywhere.

1433
01:28:53,540 --> 01:28:54,950
Out of fear there is an
uneasy feeling in my stomach!

1434
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:56,700
I couldn't have food since morning.

1435
01:28:56,790 --> 01:28:58,450
It is going out unlimited.

1436
01:28:58,540 --> 01:29:01,450
Whatever I eat,
it doesn't stay in my stomach.

1437
01:29:01,540 --> 01:29:03,200
I hear new ring tones

1438
01:29:03,290 --> 01:29:05,540
When I call the doctor,
he is not reachable.

1439
01:29:05,620 --> 01:29:07,870
- Muruga...!
- I'll leave uncle.

1440
01:29:08,040 --> 01:29:11,200
- Thank God. -What?
- I said to be good.

1441
01:29:11,290 --> 01:29:14,450
- We can't send him out until the enquiry is finished.
- Why?

1442
01:29:14,540 --> 01:29:18,200
It is found that
the bomb was in his guitar.

1443
01:29:18,290 --> 01:29:21,450
Then, will you arrest the engine driver
if a bomb gets blasted in the train?

1444
01:29:21,540 --> 01:29:23,200
How can you talk so wisely?

1445
01:29:23,290 --> 01:29:25,450
It comes automatically out of fear.
Leave it uncle.

1446
01:29:25,620 --> 01:29:27,620
They have reached!

1447
01:29:28,450 --> 01:29:31,620
How is he related to you?

1448
01:29:31,700 --> 01:29:33,700
He is related to me
through my sister.

1449
01:29:33,790 --> 01:29:35,450
He is going to be the
son-in-law to this house.

1450
01:29:35,540 --> 01:29:38,370
- It is out of gratitude.
- What gratitude?

1451
01:29:38,620 --> 01:29:41,540
We did a sin to his family.

1452
01:30:02,500 --> 01:30:03,490
It is him.

1453
01:30:04,250 --> 01:30:05,830
What do you think of yourself?

1454
01:30:05,910 --> 01:30:08,080
He'll believe if it gets missed once.

1455
01:30:08,160 --> 01:30:10,080
You are doing it as a routine business.

1456
01:30:12,330 --> 01:30:13,580
Answer me.

1457
01:30:13,660 --> 01:30:15,830
What should I tell the one
who had paid us?

1458
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:17,410
Tell me.

1459
01:30:17,500 --> 01:30:19,410
- Why don't you answer me?
- Give me the phone.

1460
01:30:19,500 --> 01:30:21,410
- You talk.
- Ok.

1461
01:30:21,500 --> 01:30:22,990
Ok, cool.

1462
01:30:23,080 --> 01:30:24,490
When will you come here?

1463
01:30:27,160 --> 01:30:30,080
Dad! Someone else had called,
but you've revealed everything.

1464
01:30:32,500 --> 01:30:34,160
What are you doing here, madam?

1465
01:30:35,580 --> 01:30:37,660
- Who are you?
- Murugan

1466
01:30:37,750 --> 01:30:40,490
- With whom did you speak last?
- A good question

1467
01:30:40,660 --> 01:30:41,990
With you only.

1468
01:30:42,410 --> 01:30:45,490
- With whom did you speak last over phone?
- That's it

1469
01:30:45,830 --> 01:30:48,410
I spoke to my village friends.

1470
01:30:48,500 --> 01:30:50,410
I had borrowed some money from them.

1471
01:30:50,500 --> 01:30:54,990
Often they call me and ask me
whether I would settle it or not.

1472
01:30:55,080 --> 01:30:56,330
Leave that.

1473
01:30:56,410 --> 01:30:58,580
You only kept
the guitar in the car.

1474
01:30:58,660 --> 01:30:59,910
I saw it for sure.

1475
01:31:00,080 --> 01:31:02,490
The bomb was in that.
What is your explanation to that?

1476
01:31:02,580 --> 01:31:05,660
Madam! You only gave me the guitar
and asked me to hide it.

1477
01:31:05,750 --> 01:31:07,740
I hid it in the car.

1478
01:31:07,830 --> 01:31:11,740
Who knows whether a bomb
or a snake was in that?

1479
01:31:11,830 --> 01:31:17,990
I may think that you would have given me
the guitar with the bomb.

1480
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:21,240
But you are not like that.
I said it for fun

1481
01:31:21,330 --> 01:31:23,240
Still I have my doubts.

1482
01:31:23,330 --> 01:31:25,830
I'll give this phone to the commissioner
and tell him what happened..

1483
01:31:25,910 --> 01:31:27,080
I'll ask him to enquire

1484
01:31:33,910 --> 01:31:35,160
Wait a minute madam.

1485
01:31:35,910 --> 01:31:39,160
I don't worry if you go to the police.

1486
01:31:39,250 --> 01:31:42,580
Before that I want to
tell you something.

1487
01:31:42,660 --> 01:31:43,740
What? Tell me.

1488
01:31:43,830 --> 01:31:47,240
It is a secret.
Not here.

1489
01:31:47,330 --> 01:31:48,490
Someone may come here.

1490
01:31:48,580 --> 01:31:52,580
You wait at the terrace.
I will..

1491
01:31:55,410 --> 01:31:56,240
It is your wish.

1492
01:31:56,330 --> 01:31:58,490
Ok, I'll wait there.
Come soon.

1493
01:31:58,580 --> 01:31:59,580
I'll come.

1494
01:32:01,080 --> 01:32:04,580
What are you going
to tell her at the terrace?

1495
01:32:06,330 --> 01:32:08,490
- Not to tell.
- Then what?

1496
01:32:08,580 --> 01:32:10,330
I am going to kill her.

1497
01:32:10,410 --> 01:32:12,490
She too?
You..

1498
01:32:12,580 --> 01:32:14,490
Why should you kill her?
What sin did she do?

1499
01:32:14,580 --> 01:32:15,490
She suspects me.

1500
01:32:15,580 --> 01:32:17,580
Even if you kill her,
won't the police suspect you?

1501
01:32:17,660 --> 01:32:18,660
She is going to commit suicide.

1502
01:32:18,750 --> 01:32:20,080
Why should she commit suicide?

1503
01:32:20,160 --> 01:32:21,580
The police has found out
what she has done.

1504
01:32:21,660 --> 01:32:23,580
- What have they found out?
- Planting the bomb in the guitar.

1505
01:32:23,660 --> 01:32:25,330
Why should she plant
the bomb in the guitar?

1506
01:32:25,410 --> 01:32:27,490
- To kill the judge.
- Why should she kill the judge?

1507
01:32:27,580 --> 01:32:29,490
To close the file of CBI case

1508
01:32:29,580 --> 01:32:31,830
- Why should she close the file?
- She took money from the opponent.

1509
01:32:31,910 --> 01:32:34,490
- Why should she take money?
- To go and settle abroad with her lover

1510
01:32:34,580 --> 01:32:37,490
- Oh gosh! How much is the amount?
- 3 crore rupees.

1511
01:32:37,580 --> 01:32:39,490
- Where is that money?
- We have to ask her lover.

1512
01:32:39,580 --> 01:32:41,490
- Where is her lovr?
- CBI should find it out.

1513
01:32:41,580 --> 01:32:44,410
Why CBI.. why do you start
again from the beginning?

1514
01:32:44,500 --> 01:32:46,490
I didn't feel giddy while
climbing the staircase.

1515
01:32:46,580 --> 01:32:48,330
- But I feel very giddy hearing your story.
- That is you.

1516
01:32:48,410 --> 01:32:51,660
How can you cook up things
before reaching the terrace?

1517
01:32:51,750 --> 01:32:52,990
That is me.

1518
01:32:53,500 --> 01:32:55,580
I feel scared at seeing you.

1519
01:33:14,500 --> 01:33:16,740
Not here..
Come there.

1520
01:33:16,910 --> 01:33:18,660
Let it be anything.
Tell here. Fast

1521
01:33:18,750 --> 01:33:20,740
There..
Come inside.

1522
01:33:24,500 --> 01:33:27,410
- Who are they?
- It is my family photo.

1523
01:33:27,500 --> 01:33:28,990
It was taken when we were young.

1524
01:33:29,500 --> 01:33:32,740
- This is?
- It is Madhavan who ran away in childhood. Why?

1525
01:33:32,830 --> 01:33:36,990
I am that Madhavan.

1526
01:33:40,080 --> 01:33:42,490
- Are you Madhavan?
- Yes.

1527
01:33:43,410 --> 01:33:44,490
It is me!

1528
01:33:45,080 --> 01:33:46,490
Think well.

1529
01:33:47,410 --> 01:33:50,910
How can I kill my own father?

1530
01:33:53,080 --> 01:33:56,740
Think over it and inform the police.

1531
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:03,490
Dear!

1532
01:34:03,580 --> 01:34:05,830
Are you our judge's son?

1533
01:34:10,410 --> 01:34:11,490
Just for fun.

1534
01:34:30,950 --> 01:34:33,450
Look! How stylishly he is sitting
and watching the scene!

1535
01:34:33,540 --> 01:34:37,450
Being my associate, does he bother
about me when I am tying a big stone?

1536
01:34:37,540 --> 01:34:38,540
Why should I ask?

1537
01:34:38,950 --> 01:34:39,870
Did you hear it?

1538
01:34:40,540 --> 01:34:43,290
How do you hear it
what I think in my mind?

1539
01:34:43,450 --> 01:34:45,040
Fine! Tell me why
I am tying the stone.

1540
01:34:45,200 --> 01:34:46,370
After you jump into the water..

1541
01:34:46,450 --> 01:34:48,620
...you shouldn't swim and reach
the shore changing your mind

1542
01:34:48,790 --> 01:34:50,200
That's why you are tying that.

1543
01:34:50,370 --> 01:34:51,870
Even a small child knows that.

1544
01:34:52,040 --> 01:34:53,950
You are a killer, aren't you?
You won't worry about me.

1545
01:34:54,040 --> 01:34:56,450
Someone is talking in Tamil.
Who is it talking in Tamil?

1546
01:34:56,950 --> 01:34:59,370
- It is me. So what?
- Are you a Tamil? -Yes.

1547
01:34:59,540 --> 01:35:00,950
- You'll live a long life.
- Damn it.

1548
01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:02,870
If I have a long life,
why should I tie this stone?

1549
01:35:03,040 --> 01:35:03,950
What do you want now?

1550
01:35:04,040 --> 01:35:05,540
I want to know where
the Howrah bridge is.

1551
01:35:07,370 --> 01:35:09,290
He is starting same as I started.

1552
01:35:09,790 --> 01:35:11,120
Why are you asking that?

1553
01:35:11,200 --> 01:35:12,120
My kin asked me to come there

1554
01:35:12,290 --> 01:35:13,700
Don't make me kill you.
Go away.

1555
01:35:13,870 --> 01:35:15,450
You seem to be very hot.
Come, let's have a cup of tea.

1556
01:35:15,540 --> 01:35:16,870
Oh gosh! This too is the same way.

1557
01:35:17,120 --> 01:35:19,290
I don't drink tea normally.

1558
01:35:20,540 --> 01:35:21,540
What about the milk of spices?

1559
01:35:21,620 --> 01:35:23,290
He is coming to hit me.

1560
01:35:23,370 --> 01:35:25,700
Are you too torturing me?

1561
01:35:27,540 --> 01:35:29,120
Why is he untying the rope?

1562
01:35:30,290 --> 01:35:31,290
He is got scared.

1563
01:35:31,700 --> 01:35:33,540
By using this, I'll make you to cry.

1564
01:35:33,950 --> 01:35:35,870
Don't remov it.
Look here!

1565
01:35:35,950 --> 01:35:37,950
Even if you remove it,
I won't change my mind.

1566
01:35:38,120 --> 01:35:39,450
I'll commit suicide definitely

1567
01:35:39,540 --> 01:35:40,790
Why do you take a hasty decision?

1568
01:35:41,040 --> 01:35:43,450
Instead of dying slow,
it's better to die right away.

1569
01:35:43,540 --> 01:35:45,450
- Cool down!
- What cool down?

1570
01:35:45,620 --> 01:35:49,120
You told her that you are
that Madhavan and winked at me..

1571
01:35:49,200 --> 01:35:51,290
- What does it mean?
- It means that I am not Madhavan.

1572
01:35:51,450 --> 01:35:54,370
Then how did you show her
the photo of Madhavan so correctly?

1573
01:35:54,540 --> 01:35:57,450
One day that grand ma
was crying with the photo.

1574
01:35:57,700 --> 01:35:58,950
I asked her what the matter was.

1575
01:36:00,120 --> 01:36:02,200
She said that she was crying
thinking of her grandson who ran away.

1576
01:36:02,370 --> 01:36:03,870
-And she showed me his photo
-Ok.

1577
01:36:04,200 --> 01:36:05,700
That moment the judge
entered in.

1578
01:36:06,370 --> 01:36:08,870
She gave me the photo
and asked me to hide it.

1579
01:36:09,540 --> 01:36:11,870
-I took and hid it at the terrace
-Ok.

1580
01:36:11,950 --> 01:36:14,540
When I tried to kill that Thara,
she turned and saw me.

1581
01:36:15,370 --> 01:36:17,950
I showed her that photo
and managed by telling I am Madhavan

1582
01:36:18,370 --> 01:36:19,200
Lord Muruga!

1583
01:36:20,540 --> 01:36:22,540
You've scared me by
telling Muruga name..

1584
01:36:22,620 --> 01:36:24,120
...and told me that
you are going to kill the judge.

1585
01:36:24,200 --> 01:36:25,450
- Did you kill him?
- Leave it.

1586
01:36:25,540 --> 01:36:27,740
- I'll do it today.
- Really? -Yes.

1587
01:36:27,790 --> 01:36:29,450
- Promise?
- You buffalo! Both are same.

1588
01:36:30,040 --> 01:36:33,200
If you don't kill him today,
I'll kill him, definitely.

1589
01:36:33,450 --> 01:36:37,120
- Ok, it's your wish.
- Why should I kill him?

1590
01:36:37,950 --> 01:36:40,450
By chating with him,
my brain became his friend.

1591
01:36:40,540 --> 01:36:42,040
I said for fun.

1592
01:36:42,290 --> 01:36:44,620
- Don't tell it to anyone.
- No, I won't tell it.

1593
01:36:44,700 --> 01:36:46,540
- But everything has been recorded.
- Where?

1594
01:36:46,700 --> 01:36:50,450
- Look there!
- Why is it standing like a man?

1595
01:36:50,540 --> 01:36:52,120
It is standing with
the help of my chewing gum.

1596
01:36:52,540 --> 01:36:54,620
You are doing every thing with a reason.

1597
01:36:54,700 --> 01:36:56,290
- Get up. I've to commit suicide..
- Leave the hand.

1598
01:36:56,540 --> 01:36:59,370
- I am tying it, isn't it?
- Are you tying it?

1599
01:36:59,540 --> 01:37:02,540
- Haven't you untied it so far?
- Why should I untie?

1600
01:37:02,790 --> 01:37:05,040
If it gets loose
you might swim and escape.

1601
01:37:05,370 --> 01:37:06,450
That's why I am tying it hard.

1602
01:37:06,540 --> 01:37:10,540
Do you have any sympathy or not?

1603
01:37:10,700 --> 01:37:13,450
Why is it blocking me?
When did you do it?

1604
01:37:13,540 --> 01:37:15,200
I tied your legs
when I was tying the stone.

1605
01:37:15,540 --> 01:37:16,490
Be fast.

1606
01:37:16,540 --> 01:37:18,830
If I fall down,
definitely I won't be alive.

1607
01:37:19,540 --> 01:37:20,620
Where is he?
He is not to be seen.

1608
01:37:22,540 --> 01:37:24,540
What are you doing?
Why do you lift me up?

1609
01:37:24,700 --> 01:37:26,200
Lay me down.

1610
01:37:26,370 --> 01:37:29,120
Oh gosh! I feel scared.

1611
01:37:29,450 --> 01:37:32,870
- Oh god! It seems too long. Save me.
- Is it so?

1612
01:37:33,370 --> 01:37:36,290
- Go man.
- Oh god!

1613
01:37:39,540 --> 01:37:41,200
I just said for fun
that I am going to commit suicide.

1614
01:37:41,370 --> 01:37:42,700
Dear ladies and gentleman!

1615
01:37:42,790 --> 01:37:45,950
Come and give your alms.
Look!

1616
01:37:46,040 --> 01:37:47,700
A person is hanging
on rope for his livelihood.

1617
01:37:47,790 --> 01:37:49,040
It is not a trick or a magic.

1618
01:37:49,120 --> 01:37:51,450
Come and see.
Give your alms.

1619
01:37:51,790 --> 01:37:52,700
That is also..

1620
01:37:54,040 --> 01:37:55,450
Watch out.
There are steps..

1621
01:37:57,790 --> 01:38:00,700
- Oh gosh!
- Why do you walk like this?

1622
01:38:01,370 --> 01:38:02,870
No dear, I slipped and fell down

1623
01:38:03,950 --> 01:38:05,200
Have you got hurt(sillara) badly?

1624
01:38:05,870 --> 01:38:06,740
How do they know?

1625
01:38:06,870 --> 01:38:09,120
- Do you know how he got it?
- How?

1626
01:38:09,290 --> 01:38:11,040
No uncle, if they watch
what I shoot in the cell phone..

1627
01:38:11,120 --> 01:38:14,620
...they will enjoy it.
- Show us. -Oh gosh!

1628
01:38:15,040 --> 01:38:16,950
If they see in it, they'll come to
know everything. Go and get it.

1629
01:38:17,200 --> 01:38:18,540
I'll do whatever you say.

1630
01:38:18,700 --> 01:38:19,870
Swear on Muruga.

1631
01:38:19,950 --> 01:38:21,540
I promise on both the Murugan!

1632
01:38:21,790 --> 01:38:22,620
Oh! Don't see that.

1633
01:38:22,790 --> 01:38:23,870
It was taken when my uncle was bathing.

1634
01:38:23,950 --> 01:38:25,200
No problem, we'll see.

1635
01:38:25,290 --> 01:38:26,080
Tell them I was naked in that

1636
01:38:26,160 --> 01:38:28,790
- He was naked in that.
- Disgusting!

1637
01:38:29,450 --> 01:38:30,540
Give me.
I'll see that.

1638
01:38:30,750 --> 01:38:32,540
Haven't you seen a man before?

1639
01:38:32,790 --> 01:38:34,540
I have seen a man bathing,
but I didn't see you bathing.

1640
01:38:34,580 --> 01:38:35,580
Why do you see that in this?

1641
01:38:35,750 --> 01:38:37,200
Come aside. I'll show you live.

1642
01:38:37,790 --> 01:38:39,950
No. After that I could neither sleep
nor play music.

1643
01:38:40,040 --> 01:38:42,950
If you play music, can you
become Harris Jayaraj in one day?

1644
01:38:43,040 --> 01:38:43,870
Get lost!

1645
01:38:47,120 --> 01:38:47,990
- I am calling you only.
- Me.

1646
01:38:48,200 --> 01:38:50,160
- Why do you show respect to me?
- Ok.

1647
01:38:50,620 --> 01:38:54,200
In our childhood, we used to bet
when we played marbles..

1648
01:38:54,290 --> 01:38:55,080
Do you remember that?

1649
01:38:55,200 --> 01:38:57,120
Yes, how can I forget it?

1650
01:38:57,200 --> 01:39:00,700
I came running to kiss you
when you won the game..

1651
01:39:02,700 --> 01:39:04,620
Even if I think it now..

1652
01:39:05,200 --> 01:39:07,200
...I feel something..

1653
01:39:26,950 --> 01:39:30,700
Why is there a dew drop on her body/

1654
01:39:31,450 --> 01:39:35,200
Why is the honey
and milk set on fire?

1655
01:39:35,950 --> 01:39:39,620
Why my mind gets melted off?

1656
01:39:40,450 --> 01:39:45,950
You disappeared into
my mind while watching!

1657
01:39:46,370 --> 01:39:50,450
Tell me if my mind is a bed.
Tell me.

1658
01:39:50,620 --> 01:39:52,870
Why have you kept yourself comnfined?

1659
01:39:53,370 --> 01:39:58,950
Come out, don't you go
anywhere leaving me alone.

1660
01:40:00,040 --> 01:40:01,790
Don't you.

1661
01:40:07,370 --> 01:40:11,200
Why is there a dew drop on her body/

1662
01:40:11,870 --> 01:40:15,450
Why is the honey
and milk set on fire?

1663
01:40:16,370 --> 01:40:20,120
Why my mind gets melted off?

1664
01:40:20,790 --> 01:40:26,450
You disappeared into
my mind while watching!

1665
01:40:26,620 --> 01:40:31,040
Tell me if my mind is a bed.
Tell me.

1666
01:40:31,200 --> 01:40:33,120
Why have you kept yourself comnfined?

1667
01:40:33,620 --> 01:40:38,950
Come, don't you go
anywhere leaving me alone.

1668
01:40:40,450 --> 01:40:42,450
Don't you.

1669
01:41:05,040 --> 01:41:09,200
Don't tear me with
the whip of silence.

1670
01:41:09,450 --> 01:41:13,450
The wound won't be cured even
if the evening breeze touches!

1671
01:41:14,040 --> 01:41:16,200
No one is watching us.

1672
01:41:16,370 --> 01:41:18,120
Come to me!

1673
01:41:18,450 --> 01:41:20,450
A little search and a little love.

1674
01:41:20,540 --> 01:41:22,450
Whose side are you?

1675
01:41:22,950 --> 01:41:26,870
Something is pushing me..

1676
01:41:28,040 --> 01:41:31,450
...I leaned like the grass
over the river!

1677
01:41:31,870 --> 01:41:39,870
Waned like the moon
at your thoughts!

1678
01:41:41,450 --> 01:41:45,450
Why is there a dew drop on her body/

1679
01:41:46,040 --> 01:41:49,790
Why is the honey
and milk set on fire?

1680
01:41:50,450 --> 01:41:54,370
Why my mind gets melted off?

1681
01:41:54,950 --> 01:41:59,040
You disappeared into
my mind while watching!

1682
01:42:34,700 --> 01:42:38,870
There was a breeze
when we were talking.

1683
01:42:39,370 --> 01:42:43,370
It took away the words we talked.

1684
01:42:43,620 --> 01:42:47,700
Did you bring a sari and garland?

1685
01:42:48,200 --> 01:42:52,370
Will you refuse to listen
to the good news?

1686
01:42:57,700 --> 01:43:01,120
You are seen there,
wherever I gaze.

1687
01:43:01,700 --> 01:43:05,450
By touching like a breeze...

1688
01:43:06,700 --> 01:43:09,950
...you made changes in the daily life.

1689
01:43:11,200 --> 01:43:15,200
Why is there a dew drop on her body/

1690
01:43:15,700 --> 01:43:19,540
Why is the honey
and milk set on fire?

1691
01:43:20,120 --> 01:43:24,120
Why my mind gets melted off?

1692
01:43:24,620 --> 01:43:30,450
You disappeared into
my mind while watching!

1693
01:43:30,540 --> 01:43:34,870
Tell me if my mind is a bed.
Tell me.

1694
01:43:35,040 --> 01:43:37,120
Why have you kept yourself comnfined?

1695
01:43:37,450 --> 01:43:43,200
Come out, don't you go
anywhere leaving me alone.

1696
01:43:44,370 --> 01:43:46,200
Don't you.

1697
01:44:06,450 --> 01:44:08,040
I am coming sir.
Sir!

1698
01:44:12,620 --> 01:44:14,870
- Who hung this photo here?
- I don't know sir.

1699
01:44:15,290 --> 01:44:16,450
Tell me. Don't you know that?

1700
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:22,450
- If you don't tell who hung it there..
- It is me.

1701
01:44:26,450 --> 01:44:27,450
Why did you do it?

1702
01:44:28,120 --> 01:44:32,370
To see if you are angry with him.

1703
01:44:32,450 --> 01:44:35,450
How can it be?
I can't forget it in my life!

1704
01:44:35,790 --> 01:44:37,450
Don't you know that he is a killer?

1705
01:44:37,700 --> 01:44:40,450
- Don't you allow him to be with you at all?
- What does it mean?

1706
01:44:40,790 --> 01:44:44,540
- If he comes all of sudden?
- I'll kill him.

1707
01:44:46,370 --> 01:44:48,450
I'll shoot and kill him
with my own hands.

1708
01:44:50,950 --> 01:44:53,540
Killing has become
very simple, in this house.

1709
01:44:54,620 --> 01:44:55,660
What are you doing?

1710
01:44:55,790 --> 01:44:57,120
I am collecting glass pieces

1711
01:44:57,790 --> 01:45:00,370
Children shouldn't get hurt.

1712
01:45:00,620 --> 01:45:02,450
That's why I've collected
it to put into dustbin.

1713
01:45:03,540 --> 01:45:06,450
Put the glass into dustbin
and burn this photo.

1714
01:45:09,450 --> 01:45:10,950
Why did you do that?

1715
01:45:13,450 --> 01:45:15,290
He is Madhavan, grandma.

1716
01:45:17,700 --> 01:45:22,040
When I was seeing him at first,
I felt that I have seen him somewhere.

1717
01:45:22,200 --> 01:45:25,450
Yes mom! I too had
the same doubt that day.

1718
01:45:28,450 --> 01:45:30,620
You know me very well, right?

1719
01:45:32,200 --> 01:45:33,040
Don't get angry

1720
01:45:33,200 --> 01:45:35,040
Aadhavan keeps in touch with me daily.

1721
01:45:35,450 --> 01:45:37,450
That judge has a long life.
He is escaping always.

1722
01:45:37,540 --> 01:45:40,290
But your life is a short one.
Is it ok?

1723
01:45:40,370 --> 01:45:43,240
- Sir! You don't know about him.
- Yes, you don't

1724
01:45:43,330 --> 01:45:46,290
He will finish the target
he takes up.

1725
01:45:46,450 --> 01:45:47,290
In how many days?

1726
01:45:47,370 --> 01:45:50,450
- He asked you ten days which hasn't finished yet.
- Yes.

1727
01:45:50,540 --> 01:45:52,450
But that judge has finished the enquiry.

1728
01:45:52,790 --> 01:45:55,370
If he submit it in 2 days,
I'll be finished.

1729
01:45:57,620 --> 01:46:01,450
Aadhavan always will be with
a perfect plan in his action.

1730
01:46:01,620 --> 01:46:06,450
That's why he changes his getup, makes
a drama and kill the person silently

1731
01:46:06,540 --> 01:46:09,790
Believe me. Your target
will be finished in 2 days.

1732
01:46:10,450 --> 01:46:11,450
What if he doesn't kill him...?

1733
01:46:11,700 --> 01:46:15,790
Then I my self will kill that judge.

1734
01:46:15,870 --> 01:46:16,660
Otherwise..

1735
01:46:22,450 --> 01:46:23,950
Only two days.

1736
01:46:26,700 --> 01:46:27,870
Take this Sweet.

1737
01:46:34,950 --> 01:46:38,040
-Take it
-Please take it. -Eat it.

1738
01:46:40,450 --> 01:46:42,200
Kin! It's enough eating.
Stop it.

1739
01:46:42,290 --> 01:46:43,200
You might get stomach ache.

1740
01:46:43,790 --> 01:46:44,870
- Turn this side.
- What madam?

1741
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:47,790
Oh gosh! Why did you hit me now?

1742
01:46:47,870 --> 01:46:49,370
Because you called him
as your brother-in-law.

1743
01:46:49,450 --> 01:46:50,950
The person who is going
to marry the sister..

1744
01:46:51,040 --> 01:46:52,450
...is called as
brother-in-law in our place.

1745
01:46:52,540 --> 01:46:55,370
- Why does he marry your sister?
- Then who else?

1746
01:46:55,450 --> 01:46:57,540
He'll marry my grand daughter.

1747
01:47:04,200 --> 01:47:06,790
So you are doing everything as planned.

1748
01:47:08,370 --> 01:47:10,620
You shouldn't have hit my uncle any way.

1749
01:47:11,540 --> 01:47:15,790
- What is this for?
- Without his help I couldn't come to this house.

1750
01:47:16,120 --> 01:47:19,120
Hey Benarji! You know us for 10 years.

1751
01:47:19,200 --> 01:47:22,620
Leaving at that time,
why did you bring him to Calcutta?

1752
01:47:22,700 --> 01:47:24,450
- He only said..
- What is that?

1753
01:47:24,700 --> 01:47:29,200
You said to me that you can bring me
here if my father's fury gets reduced.

1754
01:47:29,700 --> 01:47:30,700
Didn't you say?

1755
01:47:31,040 --> 01:47:37,370
To join me in this family
he became a servant here.

1756
01:47:37,450 --> 01:47:42,200
Uncle feels hard that
nothing has happened so far.

1757
01:47:46,290 --> 01:47:47,450
Pardon us.

1758
01:47:49,450 --> 01:47:50,540
Why is he doing all this?

1759
01:47:50,620 --> 01:47:56,370
We thought you were a fool.
But we didn't know you are intelligent.

1760
01:47:56,450 --> 01:47:57,370
Thank you so much.

1761
01:47:57,450 --> 01:48:00,370
Ok, your Tamil seems
to be strange today.

1762
01:48:00,450 --> 01:48:02,120
- How is that?
- He was caught by her.

1763
01:48:02,370 --> 01:48:04,370
This is the Tamil, learned at your age.

1764
01:48:04,450 --> 01:48:06,950
That is the one learned
in uncle's place.

1765
01:48:07,200 --> 01:48:08,370
You should have given up in the middle.

1766
01:48:11,540 --> 01:48:18,040
One minute. An important matter.
We only should know that he is Madhavan.

1767
01:48:18,290 --> 01:48:21,040
If it is known to I lay
am a an or my son...!

1768
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:23,290
- You will kill us.
- Yes! -I know

1769
01:48:23,370 --> 01:48:24,540
Go off.

1770
01:48:25,200 --> 01:48:28,450
- Hey! -Who is it?
- It is you!

1771
01:48:29,450 --> 01:48:32,120
All here mistook you as intelligent.

1772
01:48:32,830 --> 01:48:34,040
You have to maintain that.

1773
01:48:35,450 --> 01:48:36,700
- What?
- Ok boss!

1774
01:48:37,250 --> 01:48:39,370
- Take away these plates from here.
- I'll do that.

1775
01:48:39,540 --> 01:48:41,290
He seems to be haughty.

1776
01:48:41,370 --> 01:48:43,040
- Benarjee!
- I am coming sir.

1777
01:48:43,200 --> 01:48:44,450
I feel as if I have been rounded up.

1778
01:48:45,450 --> 01:48:48,790
Everyone is showing affection
on Aadhavan as judge's son.

1779
01:48:48,870 --> 01:48:49,870
I don't understand anything.

1780
01:48:49,950 --> 01:48:51,450
There is only 2 days time!

1781
01:48:52,700 --> 01:48:55,870
If no, we have to do it ourselves.

1782
01:48:56,450 --> 01:48:59,450
Not only the judge, but Aadhavan too.

1783
01:49:03,450 --> 01:49:08,290
He should not play
any instrument any more here.

1784
01:49:08,580 --> 01:49:12,370
- Give me your idea.
- There is an idea. -Is there?

1785
01:49:18,620 --> 01:49:22,040
I'm the one who tried to kill the judge
by planting the bomb in the guitar.

1786
01:49:22,620 --> 01:49:25,870
Sorry! They have doubted
you unnecessarily.

1787
01:49:26,040 --> 01:49:29,370
You idiots! He is telling the truth

1788
01:49:29,450 --> 01:49:32,290
But this whole family is
enjoying it without believing.

1789
01:49:32,370 --> 01:49:33,450
Why should I get caught?

1790
01:49:36,040 --> 01:49:39,620
Don't touch the piano
as you are interested in music.

1791
01:49:39,790 --> 01:49:45,540
- Why?
- Because I've planted the bomb in the piano this time.

1792
01:49:46,620 --> 01:49:49,540
Yes! If you stop playing the piano..

1793
01:49:49,790 --> 01:49:54,450
...you will be blasted into pieces.

1794
01:49:54,540 --> 01:49:56,540
- If I keep on playing it?
- It won't explode.

1795
01:49:56,790 --> 01:49:59,290
- But how long will you play it?
- That's right.

1796
01:49:59,450 --> 01:50:03,790
If the truth comes out,
you won't be alive the next moment.

1797
01:50:04,200 --> 01:50:06,370
I've started playing the piano.

1798
01:50:06,450 --> 01:50:09,290
So, your death is in your hands.

1799
01:50:10,540 --> 01:50:12,740
Stop it. I feel as if
my head will get shattered.

1800
01:50:12,830 --> 01:50:14,370
I'll break, if I stop playing.

1801
01:50:14,450 --> 01:50:16,160
It looks like as
if you will break now itself.

1802
01:50:16,250 --> 01:50:18,450
It is not that bomb.
If I take the hands off...

1803
01:50:18,620 --> 01:50:20,200
No. I'll die if I tell it.

1804
01:50:20,290 --> 01:50:21,950
I don't like just music.

1805
01:50:22,200 --> 01:50:24,370
I want audio and video.

1806
01:50:24,450 --> 01:50:26,540
Audio and video are there, madam.

1807
01:50:26,620 --> 01:50:30,160
- I want to see a nice stage show.
- Look Now!

1808
01:50:37,410 --> 01:50:39,740
Ok! Where is the king and the queen?

1809
01:50:39,830 --> 01:50:43,580
I just know to give ideas not acting!
Leave me off.

1810
01:50:46,580 --> 01:50:47,740
Why do you need a makeup?

1811
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:49,580
You are going to just sit
and watch the show!

1812
01:50:49,750 --> 01:50:52,580
Still you have to watch it showy!

1813
01:50:52,830 --> 01:50:56,830
- Is the lipstick bought in MGR's time?
- Yes.

1814
01:50:57,410 --> 01:51:01,490
He is gone, but you still
do it like whitewashing it.

1815
01:51:01,950 --> 01:51:06,540
- What did you say?
- No, madam. I was thinking what to do when the show is on?

1816
01:51:06,620 --> 01:51:08,450
Do something. You idiot.

1817
01:51:09,290 --> 01:51:10,200
Samprani(Incense)!

1818
01:51:11,700 --> 01:51:13,540
Get ready soon.
The stage is ready.

1819
01:51:14,870 --> 01:51:18,200
Hey! I'll do it myself.

1820
01:51:23,620 --> 01:51:25,450
- Is it how you will do it?
- It looks superb!

1821
01:51:25,540 --> 01:51:26,700
Hey! Take the cloth.

1822
01:51:46,660 --> 01:51:50,490
Come on, you lover boy!

1823
01:51:51,500 --> 01:51:55,080
No flower not
caressed by breeze, exists.

1824
01:51:56,080 --> 01:51:59,740
Why didn't I feel
this love yesterday?

1825
01:52:00,540 --> 01:52:04,490
Tell me you heart!

1826
01:52:05,500 --> 01:52:09,080
Come on, you Mona Lisa!

1827
01:52:10,080 --> 01:52:13,580
Your eyes seem to
have a message to tell.

1828
01:52:14,660 --> 01:52:18,490
I am always loyal to your love!

1829
01:52:18,660 --> 01:52:26,660
Come to me everyday.

1830
01:53:17,330 --> 01:53:21,580
I am like Marilyn Monroe!

1831
01:53:21,750 --> 01:53:23,740
I am a flower in your hands.

1832
01:53:24,250 --> 01:53:26,240
Our love is very sweet.

1833
01:53:26,540 --> 01:53:30,660
Oh flower! You're an
intoxicating lesson.

1834
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,240
Mind will fly like wind.

1835
01:53:33,500 --> 01:53:35,490
Passionate eyes will search for you!

1836
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:39,660
It is the spirit of love!

1837
01:53:40,500 --> 01:53:44,490
Do it in the morning and evening.

1838
01:53:45,330 --> 01:53:49,740
I am surprised at
your statue like beauty!

1839
01:53:49,830 --> 01:53:53,490
Cindrella! Dance with me.

1840
01:53:54,830 --> 01:53:58,740
Come on, you lover boy!

1841
01:53:59,500 --> 01:54:03,240
No flower not
caressed by breeze, exists.

1842
01:54:03,870 --> 01:54:07,740
Why didn't I feel
this love yesterday?

1843
01:54:08,500 --> 01:54:16,500
Tell me you heart!

1844
01:54:45,830 --> 01:54:50,290
You are like that Juliet!

1845
01:54:50,500 --> 01:54:52,410
Your body yearns to unite with me.

1846
01:54:52,500 --> 01:54:54,660
No need to sulk any more.

1847
01:54:55,160 --> 01:54:59,410
Fire! I am a wseet fire.

1848
01:54:59,500 --> 01:55:01,580
Come to kiss me.

1849
01:55:01,830 --> 01:55:04,160
Hunt for the pearl in my lips.

1850
01:55:04,500 --> 01:55:08,490
You are my fair lady!

1851
01:55:09,080 --> 01:55:13,160
Come, come my lover girl.

1852
01:55:13,500 --> 01:55:21,500
You are the tune for
my first love song!

1853
01:55:42,080 --> 01:55:46,490
Come on, you Mona Lisa!

1854
01:55:46,660 --> 01:55:51,160
Your eyes seem to
have a message to tell.

1855
01:55:51,500 --> 01:55:55,160
I am always loyal to your love!

1856
01:55:55,500 --> 01:56:03,500
Come to me everyday.

1857
01:56:16,160 --> 01:56:18,580
All of you, rush out.
Run...!

1858
01:56:19,580 --> 01:56:21,410
- Wait man!
- Oh gosh! It has started to work.

1859
01:56:21,500 --> 01:56:23,160
Still, why are you looking?
Get ready.

1860
01:56:23,410 --> 01:56:24,830
- Come dear!
- Oh gosh! What happened to him?

1861
01:56:37,660 --> 01:56:41,080
It's all just dream.
Oops! Crazy..

1862
01:56:42,330 --> 01:56:44,080
Henceforth I should not play
anything in this house.

1863
01:56:46,750 --> 01:56:50,580
Now, what are you doing?
Is it this?

1864
01:56:52,200 --> 01:56:54,080
- What?
- Why do you look awfully?

1865
01:56:54,250 --> 01:56:57,330
Henceforth, I wouldn't get
scared by the bomb and pistol.

1866
01:56:57,790 --> 01:56:59,830
You wouldn't shoot judge.

1867
01:56:59,910 --> 01:57:02,240
Why should I get scared unnecessarily?

1868
01:57:02,330 --> 01:57:04,660
- I am very bored. Go man!
- Uncle!

1869
01:57:05,250 --> 01:57:06,490
You keep imagining things.

1870
01:57:06,910 --> 01:57:09,910
- I'll finish of the judge in a day. It's a promise.
- Look it.

1871
01:57:10,500 --> 01:57:11,580
You definitely are going
to finish him, isn't it?

1872
01:57:12,410 --> 01:57:14,830
Take this milk!
He is in his room.

1873
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,160
Go and shoot him in his forehead
and pour the milk in his mouth.

1874
01:57:17,250 --> 01:57:21,990
I will come after they all come.
What?

1875
01:57:22,410 --> 01:57:24,240
I would get scared
when he threaten me usually.

1876
01:57:24,500 --> 01:57:26,740
But today he has become worried
when I scolded him.

1877
01:57:27,830 --> 01:57:30,330
So, I have to threaten him
like this from today.

1878
01:57:30,500 --> 01:57:32,740
Oh gosh!

1879
01:57:35,500 --> 01:57:37,240
He didn't get scared.

1880
01:57:37,830 --> 01:57:39,080
He is a terrorist.

1881
01:57:39,160 --> 01:57:40,830
What I have guessed is wrong.

1882
01:58:16,120 --> 01:58:16,910
It shouldn't fall on him.

1883
01:58:17,040 --> 01:58:18,120
You have to shoot around him.

1884
01:58:18,950 --> 01:58:20,040
If you tell about the game,
it will be very interesting.

1885
01:58:20,200 --> 01:58:22,290
It is an intelligent game.
Lot of prizes are there.

1886
01:58:22,450 --> 01:58:23,370
I will go and bring that.

1887
01:58:23,450 --> 01:58:25,540
If anyone's light goes off,
they become out.

1888
01:58:38,540 --> 01:58:41,040
What are you doing?
In this time?

1889
01:58:41,120 --> 01:58:41,950
Go to your bed and sleep.

1890
01:58:57,950 --> 01:59:00,200
- Switch off the light.
- It is not your work.

1891
01:59:00,290 --> 01:59:02,120
- Come out!
- You couldn't able to do that.

1892
01:59:02,370 --> 01:59:04,370
I will finish him.
Watch it.

1893
01:59:12,790 --> 01:59:16,290
- I am telling you don't do that.
- I will..

1894
02:00:46,910 --> 02:00:49,990
- What?
- If you send your man to kill him again..

1895
02:00:50,330 --> 02:00:52,490
...I would finish your man.

1896
02:00:52,580 --> 02:00:53,740
You won't finish him.

1897
02:00:53,830 --> 02:00:55,160
Won't you allow us to finish him?

1898
02:00:55,250 --> 02:00:57,740
Have you forgotten about
the crores you received?

1899
02:00:58,000 --> 02:00:58,830
I didn't get that.

1900
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:01,160
Have you separated us?

1901
02:01:01,330 --> 02:01:03,580
Ok, you didn't get that.
Then, get off.

1902
02:01:03,660 --> 02:01:04,790
We will finish him.

1903
02:01:05,080 --> 02:01:06,240
I won't allow you to do that.

1904
02:01:06,330 --> 02:01:07,580
To whom are you talking?

1905
02:01:07,750 --> 02:01:08,830
Have you forgotten that
you are talking to dad?

1906
02:01:08,910 --> 02:01:11,580
You are alive
as I had that in my mind.

1907
02:01:12,330 --> 02:01:14,490
Why are you talking about
father to him?

1908
02:01:14,580 --> 02:01:16,490
He has killed his own father.

1909
02:01:16,580 --> 02:01:17,740
- He would speak like that.
- No!

1910
02:01:18,500 --> 02:01:21,330
I am still talking because
no one should kill my father.

1911
02:01:29,660 --> 02:01:31,410
Is he your father?

1912
02:01:33,330 --> 02:01:35,580
Now, I am telling.
I am telling you, this finally.

1913
02:01:35,660 --> 02:01:36,990
Get out from this business.

1914
02:01:37,080 --> 02:01:38,580
I too am telling to you.

1915
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:42,660
Get out from this business.
It is good for all.

1916
02:01:42,830 --> 02:01:45,490
Advice!
Have you reformed?

1917
02:01:45,580 --> 02:01:48,330
They will finish us, the next moment,
if we are reformed.

1918
02:01:48,580 --> 02:01:50,580
- That is the specialty of this business.
- I know!

1919
02:01:51,160 --> 02:01:53,410
- I know about this business very well than you.
- For that...?

1920
02:01:53,830 --> 02:01:55,330
Do you want
my father to die now itself?

1921
02:01:55,580 --> 02:01:57,410
What are you watching?
Finish him.

1922
02:02:03,750 --> 02:02:05,580
Kill me.

1923
02:02:05,910 --> 02:02:07,490
I deserve the punishment
for bringing you up, right?

1924
02:02:07,580 --> 02:02:09,660
First, Kill me.
Kill me.

1925
02:02:10,750 --> 02:02:13,240
Are you wondering
if I am your dad or guardian?

1926
02:02:13,500 --> 02:02:14,290
No!

1927
02:02:14,410 --> 02:02:15,990
I wonder if you are
a good or a bad person.

1928
02:02:16,580 --> 02:02:17,660
Your dad is good.

1929
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,830
You too are good.
But, I am bad.

1930
02:02:21,580 --> 02:02:24,990
...very bad?
Keep it in your mind.

1931
02:02:27,410 --> 02:02:28,490
Stop man!

1932
02:02:28,580 --> 02:02:31,330
Now, I am telling.
Not only that judge..

1933
02:02:31,410 --> 02:02:35,330
If I wouldn't finish you both with in
two days, I am not Ibrahim Ravoothar.

1934
02:02:35,580 --> 02:02:36,910
Are you going to change your name?

1935
02:02:37,250 --> 02:02:38,410
It is easy for you.

1936
02:02:52,660 --> 02:02:55,990
Don't mistake me.
They didn't listen to me.

1937
02:02:56,080 --> 02:02:58,080
We all came to enjoy our holidays.

1938
02:02:58,160 --> 02:02:59,830
Why do you think about the past?

1939
02:03:00,080 --> 02:03:02,080
Your mother has died
in your birth date..

1940
02:03:02,250 --> 02:03:04,660
How long will you cry
thinking about that?

1941
02:03:05,450 --> 02:03:06,540
Yes, aunty..

1942
02:03:06,660 --> 02:03:08,990
How can we be happy,
if you are sad?

1943
02:03:09,080 --> 02:03:11,990
Please come and cut the cake aunty.

1944
02:03:22,250 --> 02:03:26,080
I have brought you Boost.
Get up!

1945
02:03:27,250 --> 02:03:28,240
It became a habit...

1946
02:03:29,250 --> 02:03:30,240
Did anyone see Madhavan?

1947
02:03:30,750 --> 02:03:34,080
- As usual, we don't know.
- Get lost, you talk active.

1948
02:03:34,160 --> 02:03:37,660
- Eat and write dear.
- Go dad! I have a lot of home work.

1949
02:03:39,250 --> 02:03:41,830
- Where has he gone?
- Why are you searching Madhavan?

1950
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:43,580
Your daughter is crying.
Come and ask her.

1951
02:03:43,660 --> 02:03:46,410
- He will take care of her.
- Oh gosh! -Slowly..

1952
02:03:48,500 --> 02:03:50,160
Don't make it empty.
Madhavan likes Vadai(Snacks), isn't it?

1953
02:03:50,250 --> 02:03:51,450
Already he has finished eating.

1954
02:03:51,910 --> 02:03:54,080
Did he? When?

1955
02:03:54,250 --> 02:03:56,240
- ...in the morning and he went out.
- Where?

1956
02:03:56,330 --> 02:03:58,160
He told that he has to go
for an important subject.

1957
02:03:59,080 --> 02:04:00,240
Important subject?

1958
02:04:02,250 --> 02:04:05,240
- Is it the first or second marble?
- First one.

1959
02:04:17,870 --> 02:04:20,790
- I have won.
- His dad! Run..

1960
02:04:21,290 --> 02:04:24,950
- Dad, don't hit me.
- How dare you play marbles in the slum place?

1961
02:04:25,290 --> 02:04:29,370
- I won't go dad.
- To play by betting. -Brother, hit me.

1962
02:04:29,450 --> 02:04:32,290
- You don't know what he did? He has played in the slum..
- I know!

1963
02:04:33,040 --> 02:04:34,290
I have only sent him.

1964
02:04:35,200 --> 02:04:37,120
Why are you asking?
What's wrong in that?

1965
02:04:37,290 --> 02:04:40,200
I've sent him out. If he stays home,
he won't know the world.

1966
02:04:40,290 --> 02:04:42,200
What's wrong
if he played marbles?

1967
02:04:42,290 --> 02:04:45,290
He will get the gold medal in Olympics,
who hits correct.

1968
02:04:45,700 --> 02:04:48,290
What brother?
Oh gosh! Dear, show it.

1969
02:04:50,290 --> 02:04:52,080
Why have you hit him like this?

1970
02:04:52,290 --> 02:04:53,370
Are you a human or animal?

1971
02:04:53,410 --> 02:04:54,830
Are you really a magistrate?

1972
02:04:55,160 --> 02:04:56,290
Daily you are seeing the criminals.

1973
02:04:56,410 --> 02:04:58,910
That's why your son too looks
like a criminal to you.

1974
02:04:59,290 --> 02:05:00,790
Don't stand before him.
Come.

1975
02:05:00,910 --> 02:05:03,330
He didn't know about your merits.

1976
02:05:03,500 --> 02:05:07,290
Brother, you might be a magistrate.
But, listen to what I say.

1977
02:05:07,370 --> 02:05:10,240
All the children are good
when they are born.

1978
02:05:10,290 --> 02:05:14,200
When they are growing up it is in our
hand to change them as good or bad.

1979
02:05:14,290 --> 02:05:17,910
Understood? You always think
about the court and case only.

1980
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,200
Only for two days in a month
just think about him..

1981
02:05:20,290 --> 02:05:21,580
...he will be reformed and
you too get a change.

1982
02:05:21,660 --> 02:05:22,490
Come let's go.

1983
02:05:30,750 --> 02:05:33,330
Don't cry Maha.
Don't cry.

1984
02:05:33,410 --> 02:05:35,660
Listen to me.
I feel sad..

1985
02:05:36,080 --> 02:05:38,080
- Don't cry!
- We are with you.

1986
02:05:39,160 --> 02:05:40,240
Why are you crying?

1987
02:05:40,410 --> 02:05:42,910
He won't come to school from tomorrow.

1988
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:45,200
His dad was arrested
in the bomb blast case..

1989
02:05:45,290 --> 02:05:46,490
Tomorrow is the judgment.

1990
02:05:46,580 --> 02:05:49,620
Definitely, he will get
life term or hang to death.

1991
02:05:49,700 --> 02:05:53,290
So his mother leaves this
place with him tomorrow.

1992
02:05:54,410 --> 02:05:56,950
Are you crying,
that you are going to miss us?

1993
02:05:57,290 --> 02:05:59,370
Do you know how good is my dad?

1994
02:05:59,750 --> 02:06:01,290
How can I be without him?

1995
02:06:01,580 --> 02:06:04,240
Do you know how much
affectionate is he with me?

1996
02:06:04,290 --> 02:06:07,830
- Really, Is he a good man?
- Yes!

1997
02:06:08,660 --> 02:06:11,490
Don't cry!
I have missed my mother.

1998
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:13,370
At least, let your mother be happy.

1999
02:06:13,830 --> 02:06:14,660
Don't worry.

2000
02:06:14,910 --> 02:06:17,200
Nothing will happen to your dad.
I am with you.

2001
02:06:17,290 --> 02:06:20,200
What is the use of that
as you are my mom?

2002
02:06:20,290 --> 02:06:23,990
I am only six years old.
But I am eating myself.

2003
02:06:24,160 --> 02:06:27,240
You are feeding him
who is a 10 years old guy.

2004
02:06:27,330 --> 02:06:29,910
What to do? He will eat only
if I feed him. He became like this.

2005
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,040
Are you my mother or his mother?

2006
02:06:32,080 --> 02:06:34,580
- For both of you.
- Look! grandma.

2007
02:06:35,500 --> 02:06:38,330
You have mother..
But he didn't have mother.

2008
02:06:38,410 --> 02:06:41,490
Pitiful, his dad is here but
he isn't affectionate with him.

2009
02:06:41,580 --> 02:06:45,740
- Isn't it? Daily, you are telling this.
- Eat!

2010
02:06:50,830 --> 02:06:52,990
What?
The time is 7:30..

2011
02:06:53,290 --> 02:06:55,410
Don't you go to school?
Eat fast!

2012
02:06:58,200 --> 02:07:00,330
What is this?
Curry is very salty.

2013
02:07:00,410 --> 02:07:02,080
What have you cooked?
You damn!

2014
02:07:02,160 --> 02:07:03,200
I have cooked well.

2015
02:07:03,580 --> 02:07:05,740
- Everyone is eating.
- Am I lying then?

2016
02:07:05,830 --> 02:07:08,120
- Yes!
- What dear?

2017
02:07:08,200 --> 02:07:09,240
I have tasted it and telling.

2018
02:07:09,330 --> 02:07:11,290
I have only put the salt in the curry.

2019
02:07:11,410 --> 02:07:12,990
But, punishment is for him!

2020
02:07:13,080 --> 02:07:14,200
What a judge you are?

2021
02:07:17,080 --> 02:07:18,580
- What do you want?
- I will tell you.

2022
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:20,740
Someone has set the bomb
and someone has dead.

2023
02:07:21,080 --> 02:07:22,740
You've arrested that person..

2024
02:07:22,830 --> 02:07:24,660
...with explosives, and punished him!
What atrocity!

2025
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:25,990
Whom are you telling about?

2026
02:07:26,200 --> 02:07:28,200
Chinnaswami, whom you are going
to tell the judgment.

2027
02:07:28,330 --> 02:07:30,080
Chinnaswami's son is his classmate.

2028
02:07:30,500 --> 02:07:32,830
He couldn't able to see
him crying. Poor thing.

2029
02:07:36,410 --> 02:07:40,490
Collector, lawyer, and police man's sons
are studying in the same school.

2030
02:07:40,830 --> 02:07:44,580
- But Chinnaswami's son is friend for you, isn't it?
- Stop man!

2031
02:07:44,660 --> 02:07:47,200
- He is motherless. Don't hit him.
- Look!

2032
02:07:47,660 --> 02:07:49,660
Yet, you are not completed
even 10 years.

2033
02:07:49,750 --> 02:07:52,660
Are you teaching me
how to write the judgment..

2034
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:55,200
...who have enquired
about the case for these months?

2035
02:07:55,250 --> 02:07:57,160
Fine! What is your rank in this term?

2036
02:07:57,830 --> 02:07:59,910
I have asked him.
What rank?

2037
02:08:01,910 --> 02:08:04,830
So, 4 intelligent students are
better off than you in your class.

2038
02:08:04,910 --> 02:08:06,410
You should mingle
only with them.

2039
02:08:06,950 --> 02:08:08,580
Else, I will peel off your skin.

2040
02:08:12,330 --> 02:08:13,490
Why are you looking here? Go.

2041
02:08:13,750 --> 02:08:15,990
- Aunty!
- Ok, leave it!

2042
02:08:17,500 --> 02:08:19,410
- If Anu ask, tell that I have gone to court.
- Ok, sir!

2043
02:08:21,160 --> 02:08:22,740
- Sir, I will take it.
- It's ok! I will take it.

2044
02:08:28,080 --> 02:08:29,910
Dad, save me!

2045
02:08:30,750 --> 02:08:32,160
Someone has kidnapped me.

2046
02:08:32,200 --> 02:08:34,080
What are you saying?
Didn't you go to school?

2047
02:08:34,200 --> 02:08:35,990
When I was going to school
in the rickshaw..

2048
02:08:36,290 --> 02:08:41,160
Sir, don't beat me.
It is painful sir. No!

2049
02:08:41,410 --> 02:08:44,330
I am not talking with police.
I am talking with my dad.

2050
02:08:44,410 --> 02:08:46,080
No, sir! it's painful.

2051
02:08:46,200 --> 02:08:49,080
- What are you saying?
- You judge!

2052
02:08:49,410 --> 02:08:50,410
Who are you?

2053
02:08:51,200 --> 02:08:52,990
Don't you have affection for your son?

2054
02:08:53,410 --> 02:08:55,910
Don't say like that.
He is my only son.

2055
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:56,990
He is my soul.

2056
02:08:57,160 --> 02:09:01,200
If you want your son, change
the judgment of Chinnaswami.

2057
02:09:02,750 --> 02:09:05,330
If he gets released,
your son too will be released.

2058
02:09:05,580 --> 02:09:06,990
What? Understand?

2059
02:09:07,080 --> 02:09:08,160
Definitely, I will do that.

2060
02:09:08,330 --> 02:09:09,660
My son is important for me.

2061
02:09:11,750 --> 02:09:12,990
You have done a fantastic job.

2062
02:09:13,160 --> 02:09:14,580
You are acting well.

2063
02:09:14,660 --> 02:09:16,200
You could act in films.

2064
02:09:16,580 --> 02:09:18,240
We will see it later..

2065
02:09:18,660 --> 02:09:20,740
Oh gosh! Police..
Come let's go!

2066
02:09:22,200 --> 02:09:24,660
CHILDREN REFORMATORY SCHOOL.
Madurai!

2067
02:09:26,200 --> 02:09:29,200
Hey boys don't look others.
Do your duty.

2068
02:09:30,200 --> 02:09:32,200
Madhava, your aunt has come to see you.

2069
02:09:38,750 --> 02:09:41,540
Look, madam! The parole time
is only 24 hours.

2070
02:09:42,120 --> 02:09:44,040
He will come with you.

2071
02:09:44,120 --> 02:09:46,040
Go decently and come. Ok?

2072
02:09:48,750 --> 02:09:49,740
Pack this.

2073
02:09:49,950 --> 02:09:52,200
- This is 25 rupees.
- I will give you. Pack it.

2074
02:09:52,870 --> 02:09:55,240
Shall we go to my friend
Maha's house, on the way?

2075
02:09:57,200 --> 02:09:58,040
Ok, come!

2076
02:10:04,870 --> 02:10:06,120
Sister, your son is coming.

2077
02:10:06,290 --> 02:10:07,620
Police too is coming with your son.

2078
02:10:07,700 --> 02:10:08,950
A madam also comes
with your son. Take it!

2079
02:10:09,040 --> 02:10:11,040
Oh gosh! Why is he bringing police?

2080
02:10:11,370 --> 02:10:14,740
- Pack it fast.
- Bring down the shutter.

2081
02:10:15,290 --> 02:10:16,790
Look mom, who has come.

2082
02:10:18,370 --> 02:10:22,450
Dear!
My darling. Come!

2083
02:10:22,950 --> 02:10:26,540
You went to jail for us in this age.

2084
02:10:26,620 --> 02:10:28,370
I will think, that I have done that
for my mother.

2085
02:10:28,450 --> 02:10:29,740
I will be back soon.

2086
02:10:29,790 --> 02:10:33,290
You will be back soon. But it will take
14 years for my father to come home.

2087
02:10:33,370 --> 02:10:35,450
- That's why my mom is worrying.
- You keep quiet.

2088
02:10:35,750 --> 02:10:36,950
You come dear and sit.

2089
02:10:37,700 --> 02:10:39,620
Dear, how is your father?

2090
02:10:39,700 --> 02:10:41,620
Nothing to him, he will be fine.

2091
02:10:41,750 --> 02:10:43,870
Aunty, it's getting late.
My aunt is waiting for me.

2092
02:10:43,950 --> 02:10:46,450
Wait, I will go and bring the saffrone
from the temple nearby.

2093
02:10:46,540 --> 02:10:47,540
It's getting late, aunty.

2094
02:10:47,700 --> 02:10:50,540
If you and your aunt take that saffrone,
you both will be prosperous.

2095
02:10:50,700 --> 02:10:51,950
- Wait a minute! I will be back soon.
- Ok!

2096
02:10:52,750 --> 02:10:53,790
Don't you give anything to eat?

2097
02:10:53,870 --> 02:10:55,740
Will you eat in our house?

2098
02:10:55,790 --> 02:10:57,120
- Do you have butter milk?
- Yes, I have!

2099
02:10:57,200 --> 02:10:58,040
Give it, man.

2100
02:10:59,830 --> 02:11:02,580
It should explode,
when they open the box. Understand?

2101
02:11:02,620 --> 02:11:04,620
Don't worry sister. They will
turn into pieces, when they open.

2102
02:11:06,950 --> 02:11:10,120
- See you! -See you, madam!
- I'll meet you after six months.

2103
02:11:22,120 --> 02:11:23,740
Who is first?
From where has he come?

2104
02:11:37,450 --> 02:11:43,950
Let us dance.
Let us sing a song.

2105
02:11:44,950 --> 02:11:46,040
All of you go and eat.

2106
02:11:58,040 --> 02:12:00,370
- I am Maha speaking.
- What man?

2107
02:12:02,750 --> 02:12:03,740
What is this bad habit?

2108
02:12:04,040 --> 02:12:05,950
- It is not me! Dad only..
- Where?

2109
02:12:06,290 --> 02:12:07,370
In the balcony.

2110
02:12:07,540 --> 02:12:08,700
The cat is for guard, isn't it?

2111
02:12:08,750 --> 02:12:09,660
Go and open the gift boxes.

2112
02:12:09,750 --> 02:12:11,950
First I will open Madhavan's gift only.

2113
02:12:12,750 --> 02:12:13,700
Go and see.

2114
02:12:14,040 --> 02:12:14,950
Are you smoking secretly?

2115
02:12:16,290 --> 02:12:18,450
Now only, my mom
has told the truth in intoxication.

2116
02:12:18,750 --> 02:12:19,950
Don't open that gift.

2117
02:12:20,370 --> 02:12:22,790
- They has kept the bomb in that.
- Aunty..

2118
02:12:36,580 --> 02:12:38,790
Don't open it.
Come!

2119
02:12:40,410 --> 02:12:41,580
You sinner!

2120
02:12:41,790 --> 02:12:42,910
I am not scared about you.

2121
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:44,160
- Then?
- For your brother.

2122
02:12:44,250 --> 02:12:45,160
Wait, I will call brother..

2123
02:12:47,660 --> 02:12:50,080
Look! She told that she wanted
to open Madhavan's gift first..

2124
02:12:50,160 --> 02:12:51,240
...but she put this down and left.

2125
02:12:58,790 --> 02:12:59,790
Aunty..

2126
02:13:02,500 --> 02:13:04,080
Get up, aunty!

2127
02:13:05,330 --> 02:13:08,700
- Look at me aunty.
- Mom..

2128
02:13:08,790 --> 02:13:12,410
Who will take care of me,
as you have left as my mother?

2129
02:13:12,660 --> 02:13:14,700
How can we take him
with us in this situation?

2130
02:13:14,790 --> 02:13:18,910
- Aunty.. -Have you gone?
- We have to do our duty, isn't it?

2131
02:13:22,790 --> 02:13:23,620
- Aunty..
- Sorry sir!

2132
02:13:23,750 --> 02:13:27,290
Yesterday, She has brought him
but now it became like this.

2133
02:13:27,790 --> 02:13:29,910
I came here to take him back with us.

2134
02:13:33,500 --> 02:13:35,790
What is this?
There is a lot of formalities..

2135
02:13:35,830 --> 02:13:37,490
...and before that you want to take him.

2136
02:13:37,750 --> 02:13:39,990
We have to fill the form.
There is a lot of formalities..

2137
02:13:40,160 --> 02:13:41,910
Not only that..
Stop! Catch him..

2138
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:43,830
Constable catch him.
Don't leave him.

2139
02:13:44,580 --> 02:13:46,330

02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:49,740
I will shoot you..
I will shoot whoever it is..

2141
02:13:49,830 --> 02:13:52,120
Let me go.
Don't come near.

2142
02:13:52,330 --> 02:13:53,410
I will shoot whoever it is..

2143
02:13:53,500 --> 02:13:54,990
- You sinner!
- Dad!

2144
02:13:55,080 --> 02:13:57,330
- What have you did..
- Dad, I will shoot you.

2145
02:13:57,790 --> 02:13:59,580
- Dad, no!
- You have killed my sister.

2146
02:13:59,660 --> 02:14:00,990
- Dad, no!
- Don't hit him!

2147
02:14:01,410 --> 02:14:02,740
Shoot me! It is the only thing
you didn't do to me.

2148
02:14:02,790 --> 02:14:04,580
- I will shoot you dad.
- Shoot me. Kill me

2149
02:14:04,830 --> 02:14:05,830

Don't come near!
I will shoot you.

2152
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:13,490
Dad!

2153
02:14:28,580 --> 02:14:30,330
Who is it? Who is it hitting
with stone at this time?

2154
02:14:31,160 --> 02:14:34,490
Who...?
Oh my god!

2155
02:14:41,290 --> 02:14:43,490
KOLKATA

2156
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:47,790
I didn't do that with any intention.

2157
02:14:48,750 --> 02:14:50,580
I did that unintentionally.

2158
02:14:51,830 --> 02:14:52,990
Sorry, dad!

2159
02:14:57,250 --> 02:14:58,580
You sinner, you have killed.

2160
02:14:59,790 --> 02:15:01,790
I didn't kill.. Please leave me.

2161
02:15:02,750 --> 02:15:03,580
Dad?

2162
02:15:05,910 --> 02:15:08,580
If I allow you to live,
you will destroy my lineage.

2163
02:15:09,500 --> 02:15:10,330
Damn it!

2164
02:15:12,410 --> 02:15:13,410
Come let's go!

2165
02:15:16,330 --> 02:15:17,790
Dad...!

2166
02:15:25,080 --> 02:15:28,240
You came from Tamil Nadu
to save my life.

2167
02:15:28,830 --> 02:15:30,330
You look like my dad.

2168
02:15:30,500 --> 02:15:31,740
That's why I have saved you.

2169
02:15:32,620 --> 02:15:34,950
Aadhava, henceforth
I am your dad.

2170
02:15:35,160 --> 02:15:36,950
I am not Aadhavan, I am Madhavan.

2171
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:38,330
It is there.

2172
02:15:38,830 --> 02:15:40,950
But, you are Aadhavan here.
Not only the name..

2173
02:15:41,080 --> 02:15:42,950
See how I am going to change you.

2174
02:15:53,410 --> 02:15:57,660
You sinner! You have born
in this family and done this.

2175
02:15:57,910 --> 02:15:59,240
Please pardon me grandmother!

2176
02:15:59,830 --> 02:16:01,240
I don't know what to do.

2177
02:16:01,660 --> 02:16:02,950
You have to help me.

2178
02:16:03,250 --> 02:16:05,490
Does anybody know this matter?

2179
02:16:05,790 --> 02:16:06,830
They don't know.

2180
02:16:07,080 --> 02:16:09,370
I have informed this matter
to you at first.

2181
02:16:09,500 --> 02:16:11,240
You are my mother, father
and everything for me.

2182
02:16:11,330 --> 02:16:12,660
You have to save me.

02:16:18,910 --> 02:16:21,990
In this situation..
You have given me a shock news.

2186
02:16:22,660 --> 02:16:24,700
- How many days...?
- 3 months.

2187
02:16:25,790 --> 02:16:26,700
Do one thing.

02:16:26,830 --> 02:16:28,240
Will you marry that I lay am a an?

2189
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:31,160
If what I have chosen is wrong..

2190
02:16:31,580 --> 02:16:34,580
...I will marry whoever it is,
whether maan(deer), or donkey.

2191
02:16:34,750 --> 02:16:36,830
Fine, is he not an innocent?

2192
02:16:38,160 --> 02:16:40,240
He has grown up in abroad.

2193
02:16:40,410 --> 02:16:41,950
It is very usual there.

2194
02:16:42,290 --> 02:16:45,540
- He will say okay for everything.
- Not ok..

2195
02:16:45,620 --> 02:16:48,040
Have you thought I am
mad enough to marry this girl?

2196
02:16:48,120 --> 02:16:50,830
- You should be very lucky to marry her.

02:16:54,620 --> 02:16:57,370
You should be lucky
to be the father of her child.

2199
02:16:57,540 --> 02:17:00,740
Oh gosh! It is a very atrocious family.

2200
02:17:00,830 --> 02:17:03,290
- See you! I will go to foreign.
- Stop man!

2201
02:17:03,370 --> 02:17:06,240
- You talked about culture.
- Then, why are you running off?

2202
02:17:06,620 --> 02:17:08,830
Someone has composed the tune..

2203
02:17:08,870 --> 02:17:10,790
...and you want me to become
the music director for that, isn't it?

2204
02:17:10,830 --> 02:17:12,290
It is not important
who composed it..

2205
02:17:12,450 --> 02:17:13,830
...but the song should become hit.

2206
02:17:14,370 --> 02:17:16,450
It is not song..
But it is atrocious.

2207
02:17:16,950 --> 02:17:19,620
Thank you grandmother!
My grandmother is great.

2208
02:17:20,290 --> 02:17:22,700
Who gave that superb idea
to get off I lay am a an?

2209
02:17:26,830 --> 02:17:27,790
That's it..

2210
02:17:27,830 --> 02:17:30,370
Maadhavan wouldn't have given
a cheap idea like this.

2211
02:17:30,450 --> 02:17:32,200
Why have you asked
me to get rid off him..

2212
02:17:32,290 --> 02:17:33,160
...and whom are you going to marry?

2213
02:17:36,330 --> 02:17:37,950
Wait, I am coming.

2214
02:17:42,580 --> 02:17:44,870
My love! My mind is freezing
because of you!

2215
02:17:44,910 --> 02:17:47,330
Hey! Love is always amazing!

2216
02:17:47,580 --> 02:17:49,870
Excuse me, let me tell you something.

2217
02:17:49,910 --> 02:17:52,160
If you laugh it sounds
like ring of an iPhone.

2218
02:17:52,370 --> 02:17:54,830
The arrow of love will hit me.

2219
02:17:54,870 --> 02:17:57,240
The love will come and rule me.

2220
02:17:57,500 --> 02:17:59,790
Will you come to save me?

2221
02:17:59,870 --> 02:18:02,120
You come to me and lie on my lap.

2222
02:18:21,700 --> 02:18:23,660
Oh my darling!

2223
02:18:23,830 --> 02:18:26,080
It is joyful to watch you laugh.

2224
02:18:26,660 --> 02:18:30,410
My youth is damped
with dew drops. Enjoy it!

2225
02:18:31,700 --> 02:18:33,700
Is there any gap between us?

2226
02:18:33,830 --> 02:18:35,990
You open your eyes in the night!

2227
02:18:36,410 --> 02:18:38,700
My days are like midnight!

2228
02:18:39,120 --> 02:18:40,330
It is a new taste!

2229
02:18:46,620 --> 02:18:50,540
Is it honey to caper?

2230
02:18:51,620 --> 02:18:59,620
My dream... my dream...
will you be mine hereafter?

2231
02:19:01,540 --> 02:19:03,450
Oh my darling!

2232
02:19:03,790 --> 02:19:05,870
It is joyful to watch you laugh.

2233
02:19:06,120 --> 02:19:09,950
My youth is damped
with dew drops. Enjoy it!

2234
02:19:11,450 --> 02:19:13,450
Is there any gap between us?

2235
02:19:13,790 --> 02:19:15,830
You open your eyes in the night!

2236
02:19:16,040 --> 02:19:18,290
My days are like midnight!

2237
02:19:18,830 --> 02:19:20,450
It is a new taste!

2238
02:19:51,120 --> 02:19:53,290
Without touching.. disturbing...

2239
02:19:53,700 --> 02:19:55,830
...the craving is in my mind.

2240
02:19:56,120 --> 02:20:00,790
The voice will vanish only
if not to be disturbed.

2241
02:20:00,830 --> 02:20:02,830
Your eyes are like missiles.

2242
02:20:03,200 --> 02:20:05,120
Nothing can be compared to you.

2243
02:20:05,790 --> 02:20:07,700
Your waist is very slim like needle.

2244
02:20:08,120 --> 02:20:10,040
Will our union break off?

2245
02:20:10,290 --> 02:20:12,790
Will it be hot if you come to me?

2246
02:20:12,830 --> 02:20:15,120
Am I a dish made of flowers?

2247
02:20:15,620 --> 02:20:17,790
Do you have any magic on your fingers?

2248
02:20:17,830 --> 02:20:20,620
You ate a little, teased a little!

2249
02:20:20,830 --> 02:20:22,700
Oh my darling!

2250
02:20:22,830 --> 02:20:25,040
It is joyful to watch you laugh.

2251
02:20:25,370 --> 02:20:29,200
My youth is damped
with dew drops. Enjoy it!

2252
02:20:40,790 --> 02:20:43,040
My love! My mind is freezing
because of you!

2253
02:20:43,120 --> 02:20:45,620
Hey! Love is always amazing!

2254
02:20:45,790 --> 02:20:47,950
Excuse me, let me tell you something.

2255
02:20:48,120 --> 02:20:50,450
If you laugh it sounds
like ring of an iPhone.

2256
02:20:50,620 --> 02:20:52,830
The arrow of love will hit me.

2257
02:20:52,910 --> 02:20:55,450
The love will come and rule me.

2258
02:20:55,620 --> 02:20:57,910
Will you come to save me?

2259
02:20:58,040 --> 02:21:00,370
You come to me and lie on my lap.

2260
02:21:10,330 --> 02:21:12,660
To live.. for me to live.. come on.

2261
02:21:12,790 --> 02:21:14,990
You are coming to kill me.

2262
02:21:15,160 --> 02:21:19,790
You are pressing into my lips
by pinning the fingers!

2263
02:21:19,830 --> 02:21:24,410
Lips stick to each other.
The flute perspires.

2264
02:21:24,790 --> 02:21:29,240
How many tricks
are from the head to toe?

2265
02:21:29,580 --> 02:21:31,790
You are wearing minimum dress!

2266
02:21:31,830 --> 02:21:34,410
Are you the blend
of the tiger and deer?

2267
02:21:34,500 --> 02:21:36,790
Is the world the rest of your beauty?

2268
02:21:36,830 --> 02:21:39,790
Are you the kissing
demon or a bed of fire?

2269
02:21:39,910 --> 02:21:41,790
Oh my darling!

2270
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:44,160
It is joyful to watch you laugh.

2271
02:21:44,330 --> 02:21:48,240
My youth is damped
with dew drops. Enjoy it!

2272
02:21:49,790 --> 02:21:51,790
Is there any gap between us?

2273
02:21:51,910 --> 02:21:54,160
You open your eyes in the night!

2274
02:21:54,500 --> 02:21:56,790
My days are like midnight!

2275
02:21:56,910 --> 02:21:58,660
It is a new taste!

2276
02:22:04,500 --> 02:22:08,660
Is it honey to caper?

2277
02:22:09,500 --> 02:22:17,500
- My dream.. my dream..
- Will you be mine hereafter?

2278
02:22:31,290 --> 02:22:32,910
Did you keep everything in your mind
what I have taught you?

2279
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:33,910
Could I forget it?

2280
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:36,370
My life is only in that.
I cannot forget it.

2281
02:22:37,040 --> 02:22:38,990
- Come on boys.
- Bring him to the upstairs.

2282
02:22:40,370 --> 02:22:41,990
What would you say?
Tell me.

2283
02:22:42,500 --> 02:22:43,700
There is a person called Aadhavan..

2284
02:22:43,910 --> 02:22:45,870
I will tell about him,
identify in the person.

2285
02:22:46,040 --> 02:22:47,830
He has tied me up in a room..

2286
02:22:47,870 --> 02:22:52,240
He has threatened my poor
uncle Benarjee with his pistol..

2287
02:22:52,330 --> 02:22:55,290
...and he has disguised like me
and went to judge's house.

2288
02:22:55,660 --> 02:22:57,870
Why has he gone there?
He'll ask me that.

2289
02:22:57,910 --> 02:23:00,200
To finish the judge..
It is me..

2290
02:23:00,370 --> 02:23:02,950
Will you tell this, wherever I ask you.
It is him..

2291
02:23:03,200 --> 02:23:06,830
Surely, I'll tell wherever you ask.
It will be my answer

2292
02:23:06,910 --> 02:23:08,580
Where are you going to say this?

2293
02:23:14,750 --> 02:23:17,660
I won't spare you,
if you mess up

2294
02:23:17,790 --> 02:23:19,910
See, how I am going to act.

2295
02:23:25,910 --> 02:23:30,660
He is fleeing.
Look there!

2296
02:23:34,160 --> 02:23:35,080
What is this?

2297
02:23:35,500 --> 02:23:38,700
It was you who have
taught me how to be alert.

2298
02:23:38,910 --> 02:23:40,540
But you have missed him.

2299
02:23:42,370 --> 02:23:43,790
He is a fraud.

2300
02:23:43,830 --> 02:23:46,200
Already he has stolen money
in a textile shop in Coimbatore..

2301
02:23:46,290 --> 02:23:47,450
...and escaped to Kolkata.

2302
02:23:47,830 --> 02:23:49,830
If you sent him to the police
to become a approver..

2303
02:23:50,120 --> 02:23:51,040
...he wouldn't go to jail.

2304
02:23:51,370 --> 02:23:52,830
He might have escaped
and went to Pollachi.

2305
02:23:53,830 --> 02:23:56,790
I am telling now too
because I have acquainted with you.

2306
02:23:56,830 --> 02:23:59,200
Leave it.
Not only my dad..

2307
02:23:59,370 --> 02:24:00,290
Leave everything.

2308
02:24:03,830 --> 02:24:05,950
Would it be over,
if you return the money?

2309
02:24:06,790 --> 02:24:08,450
If you ask the money
100 times more than this..

2310
02:24:08,540 --> 02:24:10,830
...I will give you to finish the judge.

2311
02:24:12,950 --> 02:24:15,870
We have to separate Aadhavan
from the judge, isn't it?

2312
02:24:16,160 --> 02:24:19,700
There is no use sending a single
evidence to the police station.

2313
02:24:20,080 --> 02:24:22,540
You have to send the whole group.

2314
02:24:23,040 --> 02:24:25,370
- Call the police.
- Police? -Yes!

2315
02:24:26,120 --> 02:24:27,870
You go to the police station
with your whole group.

2316
02:24:28,120 --> 02:24:29,620
Tell them about you.

2317
02:24:31,830 --> 02:24:34,540
Then, where will the police go...?
He will come!

2318
02:24:34,830 --> 02:24:36,370
Aadhavan will come back to you.

2319
02:24:36,620 --> 02:24:38,450
Finish him inside the jail.

2320
02:24:38,830 --> 02:24:41,830
I will finish the judge outside.

2321
02:24:42,830 --> 02:24:45,830
Judge shouldn't be alive..

2322
02:24:47,370 --> 02:24:50,040
...to submit the enquiry report tomorrow.

2323
02:24:52,370 --> 02:24:54,410
They belong to a brutal group who kidnap

2324
02:24:54,500 --> 02:24:56,410
...molest the children and then kill them..

2325
02:24:56,540 --> 02:24:59,740
...and operate their body,
take out their organs..

2326
02:24:59,830 --> 02:25:05,410
...and export that to the foreign
countries and earned crores.

2327
02:25:05,540 --> 02:25:10,080
The first criminal Dr.Abdul Kulkarni
is the leader of this gang.

2328
02:25:10,540 --> 02:25:14,160
I order the government
to give death sentence for him..

2329
02:25:14,540 --> 02:25:17,830
...and to the politicians, and doctors,
those who helped him.

2330
02:25:24,750 --> 02:25:26,490
Whom are you hitting?
You are a criminal.

2331
02:25:29,790 --> 02:25:32,540
Why are you hitting him?

2332
02:25:32,580 --> 02:25:33,870
Uncle! Do you know who is he?

2333
02:25:39,660 --> 02:25:41,240
Sir, why are you hitting Madhavan?

2334
02:25:41,330 --> 02:25:43,540
He is not Madhavan.
He is Aadhavan.

2335
02:25:45,500 --> 02:25:46,410
Why are you hitting?

2336
02:25:49,540 --> 02:25:50,540
Why are you shouting?

2337
02:25:52,290 --> 02:25:55,410
- Grandma, tell him to stop hitting.
- Why are you hitting?

2338
02:25:58,080 --> 02:25:59,410
- Tell him to stop!
- Stop it!

2339
02:25:59,750 --> 02:26:01,410
Don't you hear my shouting?

2340
02:26:02,080 --> 02:26:02,870
Why are you hitting him?

2341
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:05,040
Why should I beat him,
if he comes wherever I ask to come?

2342
02:26:05,250 --> 02:26:07,740
- No, sir! if you know about him..
- See, he is talking..

2343
02:26:13,080 --> 02:26:15,080
Grandma, he didn't allow him to speak..

2344
02:26:15,250 --> 02:26:16,330
He is hitting like this..

2345
02:26:17,830 --> 02:26:19,240
Take him and throw him out of here.

2346
02:26:19,330 --> 02:26:21,490
Do you know whom you are hitting?
He is our..

2347
02:26:21,540 --> 02:26:23,660
I know! I know about him.
That's why I am hitting.

2348
02:26:23,830 --> 02:26:26,830
I am hitting the murderer
who have come to kill your son.

2349
02:26:27,080 --> 02:26:28,990
What? Did he come to kill me?

2350
02:26:31,330 --> 02:26:33,540
Don't believe him.
Please listen to me.

2351
02:26:33,910 --> 02:26:35,540
- He is our..
- No need! Don't believe me!

2352
02:26:35,660 --> 02:26:37,160
I know you won't
believe me if I tell you.

2353
02:26:38,540 --> 02:26:39,540
Hey! You..

2354
02:26:54,250 --> 02:26:55,620
- Tell them.
- Yes, madam.

2355
02:26:56,540 --> 02:26:59,540
Aadhavan has come like
my kin to kill the judge.

2356
02:26:59,790 --> 02:27:02,830
He is the Coimbatore groom Murugan
who is going to marry my sister.

2357
02:27:03,200 --> 02:27:05,240
I too played a drama with him
for these days with fear..

2358
02:27:05,450 --> 02:27:08,160
...because Aadhavan has threatened me
that he would kill him.

2359
02:27:08,250 --> 02:27:09,870
Somehow I have escaped from that gang.

2360
02:27:09,950 --> 02:27:12,910
- Today morning only I came to my uncle.
- Yes, madam.

2361
02:27:13,250 --> 02:27:16,120
We wanted to tell the truth
but, before that the police has come.

2362
02:27:16,370 --> 02:27:19,620
Sir! Aadhavan didn't do any mistakes..

2363
02:27:20,120 --> 02:27:21,540
Then why are you hitting him?

2364
02:27:21,700 --> 02:27:23,160
Enough! It's enough
what you have said.

2365
02:27:23,250 --> 02:27:26,040
Tell the rest in the court.
Take them!

2366
02:27:29,290 --> 02:27:31,540
We have caught Raavoothar
who has brought him up with his gang.

2367
02:27:32,620 --> 02:27:35,790
They told A-Z details about him.

2368
02:27:35,950 --> 02:27:37,370
He is a professional killer.

2369
02:27:38,290 --> 02:27:39,490
He belonged to a mercenary group.

2370
02:27:46,540 --> 02:27:48,620
Who has sent you to kill me?

2371
02:27:49,120 --> 02:27:51,950
You too are a witness for my enquiry.
Tell me!

2372
02:27:52,950 --> 02:27:56,120
- He won't tell.
- He too in the.. -You

2373
02:27:58,040 --> 02:28:00,370
I know how to bring out the truth.

2374
02:28:02,200 --> 02:28:03,540
Whether he is good or bad..

2375
02:28:03,620 --> 02:28:05,870
Don't beat him here.
Take him away.

2376
02:28:09,620 --> 02:28:10,950
We will see the rest in the court.

2377
02:28:11,500 --> 02:28:13,700
You know, what he will do
if we send him to the court.

2378
02:28:21,040 --> 02:28:22,700
Tell them to put the guns down.
Tell them.

2379
02:28:24,540 --> 02:28:27,120
All put your guns down.

2380
02:28:32,540 --> 02:28:34,790
No!
Listen to me.

2381
02:28:38,790 --> 02:28:39,790
Don't beat him.

2382
02:28:46,540 --> 02:28:51,290
- No!
- Put your guns down, else I will shoot him.

2383
02:28:52,950 --> 02:28:58,120
Go to his room, put the laptop,
pen drive in a bag and bring it. Go!

2384
02:28:59,790 --> 02:29:00,790
Grandma!

2385
02:29:01,620 --> 02:29:04,040
Go, else I will shoot him here.

2386
02:29:04,120 --> 02:29:07,290
That sinner might kill him.
Go and bring it. Go!

2387
02:29:07,370 --> 02:29:09,540
- Go, dear!
- Thara, don't do it.

2388
02:29:19,370 --> 02:29:21,410
Come! Bring it. Is everything in this,
that what I have asked?

2389
02:29:21,500 --> 02:29:23,040
- Yes, everything is in this.
- Go!

2390
02:29:23,370 --> 02:29:24,290
Come!

2391
02:29:25,370 --> 02:29:27,490
He will die.

2392
02:29:31,950 --> 02:29:33,620
Go and start the vehicle.

2393
02:29:34,290 --> 02:29:35,290
Get inside.

2394
02:29:35,500 --> 02:29:36,490
Fast!

2395
02:29:43,500 --> 02:29:44,830
What are you saying?

2396
02:29:45,040 --> 02:29:47,790
- Are you playing?
- I have lost my hand and leg.

2397
02:29:48,450 --> 02:29:49,540
How could I play with this?

2398
02:29:49,620 --> 02:29:51,490
- Judge too?
- Yes, sir!

2399
02:29:52,200 --> 02:29:54,950
Yes, sir!
Not only the laptop..

2400
02:29:55,500 --> 02:29:57,540
...-and also the pen drive.
- Is it white ambassador?

2401
02:29:57,620 --> 02:29:58,540
Yes, sir!

2402
02:29:58,620 --> 02:30:00,370
Are you sure that no one
around you know Tamil?

2403
02:30:00,450 --> 02:30:02,540
Yes, sir! Here, all are Bengalis.

2404
02:30:02,790 --> 02:30:04,490
I am the only Tamil.

2405
02:30:18,500 --> 02:30:19,790
I have heard everything
and have come here.

2406
02:30:19,870 --> 02:30:21,200
Sir, Aadhavan is..

2407
02:30:22,700 --> 02:30:24,290
Why have you come here?

2408
02:30:24,500 --> 02:30:26,410
I am a higher official than you..

2409
02:30:26,500 --> 02:30:27,410
Did you inform me?

2410
02:30:27,500 --> 02:30:29,200
He has called to someone..

2411
02:30:29,290 --> 02:30:32,540
...-and told about the pen drive and laptop.
- No, sir..

2412
02:30:34,700 --> 02:30:37,370
Take him to the police custody
and give the treatment.

2413
02:30:40,500 --> 02:30:42,290
I will kill you! Go man.

2414
02:30:43,200 --> 02:30:46,040
Really Aadhavan has tried
to kill the judge.

2415
02:30:46,700 --> 02:30:48,700
When the judge came here, that day..

2416
02:30:48,790 --> 02:30:51,370
...we chased the group
which have come to shoot the judge.

2417
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:24,160
Leave him!

2418
02:31:24,250 --> 02:31:25,370
Go!

2419
02:31:27,330 --> 02:31:30,080
This type of beating
is common for you, isn't it?

2420
02:31:30,250 --> 02:31:33,830
You'll try to kill the judge, if you
get the money more than this, won't you?

2421
02:31:34,830 --> 02:31:37,580
I know, that you will finish
the judge again.

2422
02:31:37,790 --> 02:31:42,240
Sir, he is my father.

2423
02:31:44,830 --> 02:31:47,080
How can I kill him?

2424
02:31:54,330 --> 02:31:55,370
Dad!

2425
02:31:56,080 --> 02:31:57,080
Ok!

2426
02:31:57,160 --> 02:32:01,580
If you are not there, they will kill
the judge with someone, isn't it?

2427
02:32:01,750 --> 02:32:03,240
I won't allow them.

2428
02:32:03,910 --> 02:32:05,990
I won't allow them to kill my father.

2429
02:32:06,160 --> 02:32:07,580
You can't do it!

2430
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:08,990
No, I can!

2431
02:32:09,080 --> 02:32:12,410
- They are a big group, you can't do it.
- I can...!

2432
02:32:12,580 --> 02:32:13,830
What can you do?

2433
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:16,660
You have to protect him being
with him 24 hours, guarding.

2434
02:32:16,750 --> 02:32:18,080
Can you do that?

2435
02:32:18,250 --> 02:32:19,660
You can't do that, can you?

2436
02:32:20,580 --> 02:32:23,160
You can be able to do that,
if you do what I say.

2437
02:32:23,830 --> 02:32:26,080
For that, you have to
become as approver.

2438
02:32:27,160 --> 02:32:29,410
Why are you laughing?

2439
02:32:29,500 --> 02:32:30,990
Not only for your father..

2440
02:32:31,080 --> 02:32:33,240
It is the chance to do good
for our whole department.

2441
02:32:33,330 --> 02:32:34,410
Won't you do that?

2442
02:32:34,580 --> 02:32:35,580
I..

2443
02:32:36,370 --> 02:32:38,080
- I can't!
- You can.

2444
02:32:38,250 --> 02:32:40,240
You can able to do that.

2445
02:32:41,500 --> 02:32:44,240
I have sent him to your house..

2446
02:32:44,330 --> 02:32:46,990
...to catch the thugs and
the terrorist group.

2447
02:32:47,080 --> 02:32:49,490
He too has acted like a slayer.

2448
02:32:49,830 --> 02:32:52,160
Not only to save the judge..

2449
02:32:52,250 --> 02:32:55,410
I think he took also the response
to submit the enquiry findings..

2450
02:32:55,500 --> 02:32:57,410
...of judge in the court.

2451
02:32:57,660 --> 02:33:00,330
He could have gone to commissioner
office to meet me.

2452
02:33:00,370 --> 02:33:02,370
You need not have to worry.

2453
02:33:05,370 --> 02:33:08,290
- Go to the right.
- Don't listen to him.

2454
02:33:08,370 --> 02:33:11,490
Please stop near a police station.
Don't be scared.

2455
02:33:11,660 --> 02:33:14,410
- No, uncle! He will kill you.
- It's ok dear!

2456
02:33:14,500 --> 02:33:16,370
I don't worry, even if he kills me.

2457
02:33:16,410 --> 02:33:18,080
Please listen to me.

2458
02:33:18,250 --> 02:33:19,990
I do not worry about my life

2459
02:33:20,160 --> 02:33:21,330
No, dad!

2460
02:33:21,500 --> 02:33:23,370
I won't allow you to die.

2461
02:33:23,750 --> 02:33:25,370
Nothing will happen to you.

2462
02:33:25,500 --> 02:33:27,410
Even if I die, I do not worry..

2463
02:33:28,160 --> 02:33:32,240
I have lived one week with
our family which I have lost.

2464
02:33:32,410 --> 02:33:33,990
That's enough for me.

2465
02:33:35,330 --> 02:33:39,290
This is the first time
that I am very close..

2466
02:33:39,370 --> 02:33:41,580
...to you in my life.

2467
02:33:42,370 --> 02:33:44,410
I want to stay with you dad.

2468
02:33:44,660 --> 02:33:47,080
I love you very much, dad!

2469
02:33:48,500 --> 02:33:49,580
You could talk.

2470
02:33:53,370 --> 02:33:54,370
Who is it?

2471
02:34:09,660 --> 02:34:11,370
You, take off your hand.

2472
02:34:16,410 --> 02:34:19,490
Madhava..

2473
02:34:22,500 --> 02:34:24,330
Are you Madhavan?

2474
02:34:27,580 --> 02:34:30,240
Are you my son Madhavan?

2475
02:35:00,500 --> 02:35:03,080
Pour petrol and set fire.

2476
02:35:50,500 --> 02:35:52,370
Who is it?

2477
02:35:52,830 --> 02:35:58,740
Dad!

2478
02:36:24,910 --> 02:36:26,080
Who?

2479
02:37:09,370 --> 02:37:10,990
No, leave him!

2480
02:37:29,830 --> 02:37:31,490
No, Madhava.

2481
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:38,370
Leave him!

2482
02:37:50,370 --> 02:37:52,410
Dad! Wait!

2483
02:38:09,250 --> 02:38:11,370
No!

2484
02:38:13,660 --> 02:38:14,660
Dad!

2485
02:38:22,330 --> 02:38:23,830
Oh gosh!

2486
02:38:30,580 --> 02:38:38,580
Get up!

2487
02:38:40,080 --> 02:38:42,580
Why have you come after a long time?

2488
02:38:42,660 --> 02:38:45,080
Is it to die before my eyes?

2489
02:38:49,660 --> 02:38:53,490
Not only the judge, we have to
destroy all which is in the laptop.

2490
02:39:01,080 --> 02:39:02,410
Time has been set in that.

2491
02:39:04,500 --> 02:39:05,990
Oh gosh!

2492
02:39:12,410 --> 02:39:15,080
Oh my god! Everything has lost.

2493
02:39:19,830 --> 02:39:21,370
Oh gosh!

2494
02:39:26,750 --> 02:39:29,370
We too will come with you.

2495
02:39:41,410 --> 02:39:43,830
Madhava, run away!
Run.

2496
02:39:43,910 --> 02:39:45,830
There is a bomb in this car.

2497
02:39:45,910 --> 02:39:48,240
It will blast in a little time

2498
02:39:48,330 --> 02:39:50,490
Petrol is also flowing in the ground.

2499
02:39:53,000 --> 02:39:54,660
Dear, take out that laptop.

2500
02:39:59,750 --> 02:40:01,910
Take that laptop and run.

2501
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:04,160
Handover it to the police

2502
02:40:04,250 --> 02:40:05,410
Go!

2503
02:40:08,910 --> 02:40:11,740
- Dad!
- You can't be able to save us.

2504
02:40:11,830 --> 02:40:14,490
It is going to explode in a minute.

2505
02:40:15,080 --> 02:40:16,080
Run!

2506
02:40:16,160 --> 02:40:18,490
Take that laptop and run.

2507
02:40:29,330 --> 02:40:30,910
Madhava, no!

2508
02:41:13,250 --> 02:41:14,580
Come!

2509
02:41:40,910 --> 02:41:42,410
Dad!

2510
02:41:42,830 --> 02:41:45,450
I have saved you, dad.

2511
02:41:46,450 --> 02:41:48,330
Dad!

2512
02:42:54,120 --> 02:43:02,120
Can't block sun rays even if
thousand hands block the way!

2513
02:43:04,370 --> 02:43:12,370
Tides won't subside
at anyone's command

2514
02:43:13,080 --> 02:43:20,740
Dance to the tune!

2515
02:43:20,870 --> 02:43:23,240
If I come dancing, I will slip
on the steps and break my teeth.

2516
02:43:23,370 --> 02:43:25,450
- Why are you flattering me now?
- I didn't flatter.

2517
02:43:25,700 --> 02:43:27,410
- A small request.
- What?

2518
02:43:27,540 --> 02:43:32,160
I'll maintain this house
but I can't able to maintain this crowd.

2519
02:43:32,290 --> 02:43:35,580
- For that...?
- For that, I've brought two assistants for me from my native.

2520
02:43:35,870 --> 02:43:37,830
- Who are they?
- My kins.

2521
02:43:38,370 --> 02:43:40,950
- Oh gosh!
- Is it from the beginning, again?

2522
02:43:41,040 --> 02:43:43,990
- Fine, where are they?
- They are waiting outside.

2523
02:43:44,160 --> 02:43:47,740
- Ask them to come inside! Let us see..
- Kins..

2524
02:43:50,790 --> 02:43:52,490
- Madam is calling you.
- Wait, I will come.

2525
02:43:55,250 --> 02:43:56,080
Oh gosh!

2526
02:43:56,580 --> 02:43:59,080
Brother, whole family is surrounding us.

2527
02:43:59,250 --> 02:44:00,370
I feel giddy.

2528
02:44:01,080 --> 02:44:02,660
- Greetings to everyone.
- Greetings!

2529
02:44:03,290 --> 02:44:05,370
- Are they both your kins?
- Yes!

2530
02:44:06,370 --> 02:44:07,290
How?

2531
02:44:07,450 --> 02:44:10,830
He is my sister's husband
who gave me a slap.

2532
02:44:11,000 --> 02:44:12,450
- What about him?
- He is..

2533
02:44:13,580 --> 02:44:14,990
He is my elder sister's husband
who has slapped me twice.

2534
02:44:15,080 --> 02:44:17,660
Fine. What kind of work do you know?

2535
02:44:17,790 --> 02:44:21,450
- I'll do all the work like chopping, splitting, etc..
- What?

2536
02:44:21,700 --> 02:44:24,370
Oh gosh! Why are you blabbering?
Tell him clearly.

2537
02:44:24,410 --> 02:44:26,370
Chopping means cutting the vegetables..

2538
02:44:26,410 --> 02:44:28,910
Brother can cut the vegetables,
and maintain the computer etc..

2539
02:44:29,200 --> 02:44:30,290
What will your brother do?

2540
02:44:30,370 --> 02:44:33,700
- He'll take care to chop the meats, and gardening, etc..
- Yes, sir!

2541
02:44:33,790 --> 02:44:36,330
- Are you from Coimbatore?
- Yes, he is from Udumalapettai.

2542
02:44:36,370 --> 02:44:38,240
What? Is he the pet with Udhai?

2543
02:44:38,580 --> 02:44:39,450
No, it is Udumalapettai.

2544
02:44:39,540 --> 02:44:42,830
- Yes, sir! And he is from Thirupur.
- He is turning his neck superbly.

2545
02:44:42,950 --> 02:44:43,870
Hey, move man.

2546
02:44:44,250 --> 02:44:45,910
Fine, do you know how to cook?

2547
02:44:46,080 --> 02:44:47,200
We will cook tasty items.

2548
02:44:47,330 --> 02:44:49,290
Do you know to cook Paniyaram?

2549
02:44:49,370 --> 02:44:51,830
Ask him, how we will cook.

2550
02:44:51,950 --> 02:44:53,290
Again, Why are you talking
about shooting cooking?

2551
02:44:53,370 --> 02:44:55,330
- No, uncle! I tried to say that we will cook tastily.
- Tell him!

2552
02:44:55,370 --> 02:44:57,290
It is not difficult to
prepare the paniyaram.

2553
02:44:57,370 --> 02:45:00,330
Take a cup of rice and
add some black grams..

2554
02:45:00,370 --> 02:45:04,290
...and soak it in the water for
half an hour and grind it for 15 minutes,

2555
02:45:04,370 --> 02:45:07,540
...and put it in the hot oil, fry it and
take out. It is the Vella paniyaram.

2556
02:45:07,620 --> 02:45:10,290
If you add some jaggery
and fry it well..

2557
02:45:10,370 --> 02:45:11,830
...you will get the Karuppu paniyaram.
- That's all!

2558
02:45:11,950 --> 02:45:14,950
Leave it! Which program do you
like to watch in the TV?

2559
02:45:15,080 --> 02:45:16,830
- Chimmini, that is..
- Chimmini?

2560
02:45:16,950 --> 02:45:19,200
She looks very small.
That's why she is chimmini(small)..

2561
02:45:20,080 --> 02:45:21,580
I like to watch from
Jettix to cookings..

2562
02:45:21,700 --> 02:45:23,910
...and from Dora to Thara.

2563
02:45:24,620 --> 02:45:27,790
Please be patient.
He is new..

2564
02:45:27,910 --> 02:45:30,910
- Brother, Thara is his wife.
- Oh gosh! Sorry sister.

2565
02:45:32,450 --> 02:45:35,200
- Did you bring the fish when you came?
- Yes, two!

2566
02:45:35,370 --> 02:45:36,490
- If you fry it..
- The head is for you..

2567
02:45:36,580 --> 02:45:38,450
Why are you talking about the past...?

2568
02:45:38,620 --> 02:45:41,370
Sir, just tell me no.
I will send him out..

2569
02:45:41,450 --> 02:45:44,290
- Oh gosh! Vinayaga!
- Is it Vinayagar now after Murugan?

2570
02:45:44,370 --> 02:45:47,660
Sir, I couldn't.
Please select him for the job.

2571
02:45:47,790 --> 02:45:50,370
Henceforth, my son is
everything in the house.

2572
02:45:52,450 --> 02:45:55,370
They don't look like good people for me.

2573
02:45:56,080 --> 02:45:58,290
You know very well about the murderers.

2574
02:45:58,830 --> 02:46:02,370
Look at them well and
tell what type are they?

2575
02:46:03,370 --> 02:46:04,200
Oh gosh!

2576
02:46:05,200 --> 02:46:06,870
Brother, I didn't do anything.
He has only taught me.

2577
02:46:07,950 --> 02:46:10,790
Why you people are circling like this?
Come to a decision.

2578
02:46:11,330 --> 02:46:12,540
Oh mom!

2579
02:46:12,620 --> 02:46:14,660
I wonder when he is going to finish us
by pouring the turmeric water..

2580
02:46:17,330 --> 02:46:20,910
- They are not ordinary kins.
- Then?

2581
02:46:21,950 --> 02:46:23,410
They are very clever and smart!

2582
02:46:23,500 --> 02:46:25,410
- So, success.
- Then, you are selected.

2583
02:46:25,500 --> 02:46:26,990
Thank you very much for everyone.
