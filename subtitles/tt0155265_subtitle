1
00:00:06,973 --> 00:00:18,680
God is the great power in the world.

2
00:00:34,667 --> 00:00:37,329
Greets to everybody. Did you fear?

3
00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:43,366
l would like to show you
a differnt Rajini now.

4
00:00:43,576 --> 00:00:45,441

l want to make you to laugh.

6
00:00:50,483 --> 00:00:54,817
How? Acting like twins...?

7
00:00:54,888 --> 00:01:01,418
How? Are you believing
the twins concept?

8
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:09,526
Why not? He is looking like me.

9
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:13,238
lf two persons have same
characters in the world...

10
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:15,398
Can't we see 2 persons
with the same appearance?

11
00:01:16,276 --> 00:01:19,507
Yes. Why not? What is your opinion?

12
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:26,244
Somehow. Do you know our aim?

13
00:01:26,352 --> 00:01:28,718
To make you to laugh. Ok...

14
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:34,558
Forgery...

15
00:01:53,313 --> 00:02:02,779
Forgery. Heart is full of Forgery.

16
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:12,527
Lot of dramas & lot of roles.

17
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:22,535
A man came as a king. But
he doesn't have kingdom.

18
00:02:22,675 --> 00:02:26,975
A man acted like a bridegroom.
But he has no bride.

19
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:31,817
A man came as a king. But
he doesn't have kingdom.

20
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:37,218
A man acted like a bridegroom.
But he has no bride.

21
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:46,459
No shame & suffer. Nothing is wrong.

22
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:56,532
Sage in the morning &
mother-in-law in the evening.

23
00:02:56,643 --> 00:03:06,450
Forgery. Heart is full of Forgery.

24
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:19,395
What? Petrol is over. Oh...

25
00:03:19,465 --> 00:03:21,933
l think there is no petrol bunk nearer.

26
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:27,498
Where is the Mosque street here?

27
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:29,966
3rd street from here.

28
00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:32,642
Which 3? 12 & 3rd street.

29
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:35,270
We are new to this
area. Tell us briefly.

30
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:37,975
A Lord Vinayaga temple will
come if you go striaght...

31
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:40,411
Vinayaga temple. Will it
come or should we go there?

32
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:42,487
We'd go there. What a question is this?

33
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:44,489
l want to know briefly. That's why.

34
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:46,925
Do you know where is door number 13?

35
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:50,021
Next to number 12. Go & ask there.

36
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:53,459
Do you know Thathachari?
How do l know that?

37
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,361
How long should we go to market?

38
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:57,795
lt'll take 2 kilometer. Leave me.

39
00:03:57,971 --> 00:04:01,270
ls that enough? This is
enough for 2 kilometers.

40
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:10,908
Forgery. Heart is full of Forgery.

41
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:35,633
Valluvar told that we
could lie for good things.

42
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:40,678
A man robbed to build
temple for his country.

43
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:45,217
He told good things &
he left the principle.

44
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:50,584
ls living like this a benefit?

45
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:59,860
Forgery.

46
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:38,964
Man without manliness &
with mustache is not brave.

47
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:43,833
Clock without 2
indicators won't show time.

48
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:48,812
Man without manliness &
with mustache is not brave.

49
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:53,645
Clock without small & large
indicators won't show time.

50
00:05:53,786 --> 00:06:02,694
Take sword for good
thing. Or leave that.

51
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:12,636
We can do anything.
Goodness is important.

52
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:31,756
Forgery.

53
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:52,903
What's this? See carefully.

54
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:56,611
Don't show magic in front of my car.

55
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:59,241
lt's shouting getting fear.

56
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:03,379
Ok. You'll fly into
the house wearing wheel.

57
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:04,684
Have you come to street now?

58
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:06,257
This is 1981 , uncle...

59
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:09,354
lf l come by walk to get
vegetable, l'll take 7 minutes.

60
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:10,555
lf you go by this,
you'll take 3 minutes.

61
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:14,188
We can do lot of matters
in the balance 4 minutes.

62
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,895
Ok. Go to Kannamapet.

63
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:21,337
Kannamapet? Did your patient pass away?

64
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:24,367
Not like that. l am going
to give injection now only.

65
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:28,441
ls result going to come
today to your brother?

66
00:07:28,514 --> 00:07:30,982
Yes uncle. Tell him that
l'll come with big stick.

67
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,920
You are very slow.

68
00:07:35,254 --> 00:07:36,619
l'll go in front.

69
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:58,332
l got the smell of hospital. Come.

70
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:00,905
What? What would you like to have?

71
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:03,444
No. You people are
vegeterian. lt's not fit to me.

72
00:08:03,716 --> 00:08:05,946
l need some creatures daily.

73
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:11,316
Your dad's last month
medical shop income 1659 Rs.

74
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:14,416
l calculated yesterday
itself. Keep it safely inside.

75
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,626
Your dad told me to start medical shop.

76
00:08:17,763 --> 00:08:18,923
He passed away...

77
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:23,396
See. l'll give prescription
to the patient...

78
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,562
l'll give medicine in the medical shop.

79
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:29,706
lf Chandran passes, l'll
allot him in the medical shop.

80
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:32,468
He is telling that he
wants Bank job only.

81
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:34,772
What is he thinking?

82
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:38,382
Canara & lndian Bank
chairmen are waiting out...

83
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:39,383
To give job to him.

84
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:46,715
What a noise is that? Brother has come.

85
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:49,589
What he breaks? lf he
gets angry, he'll break.

86
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:52,320
What's anger now? He
might have got his result.

87
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:55,390
Did he fail? What man? lt seems.

88
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:06,905
ldiot. You'd study proper
in your exam timings.

89
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,908
Are you breaking things in the house?

90
00:09:09,515 --> 00:09:13,212
l am giving money for your late dad.

91
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:14,913
You ate well.

92
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:17,417
You've failed now. Sinner!

93
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:20,883
You started to smoke
in your 8th standard.

94
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:22,683
ln your 10th standard... You turn..

95
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:23,921
You started to sight.

96
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:26,322
You started to drink liquor
in your 12th standard.

97
00:09:26,532 --> 00:09:30,764
How can you pass? ln
which subject you failed?

98
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:38,402
Tell me. l've passed
in all the subjects.

99
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:39,873
Why did you pretend like this?

100
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:44,409
l saw your stethascope.
l decided to raise you BP.

101
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:48,646
Fool. lf l had passed
away... Can you die so soon?

102
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:52,186
You'd kill more people. Fool. How is it?

103
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:54,417
l pretended very well.

104
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:56,524
l don't know how you will work.

105
00:09:56,996 --> 00:10:00,193
You'll become a great actor.

106
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,633
You are trying to make
me to work in my teenage.

107
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,930
ls this justice? l should earn monthly.

108
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:10,333
l should roam the city happily. Here.

109
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,237
Write an application as l dictate you.

110
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:17,445
Lord Muruga. Write Lord
Muruga's name on the top.

111
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:19,307
Will anybody write God's
name in the application?

112
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,852
Do what l say. There is a matter.

113
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:23,515
Have you finished writing?

114
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:40,504
l'll give you 10 Rs.
Can you pay my chit fund?

115
00:10:40,606 --> 00:10:41,664
l should not do your personal work.

116
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:43,798
l am the Manager of this office.

117
00:10:43,876 --> 00:10:45,275
This is our boss order.

118
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:50,315
Boss. Sorry sir. l should
not connect the private call.

119
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:51,577
This is our boss order.

120
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:55,349
Greets sir.

121
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,485
How many members applied
for the job? Totally 1 70.

122
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:28,652
13 members don't have
experience in them.

123
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:31,986
Our country gets spoiled
by old people only.

124
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:34,259
They are getting confused
to take a decision.

125
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:35,482
lf you ask me...

126
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:38,955
There'd be a law to dismiss
workers above 50 years...

127
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:39,923
Then only our country
will get good state.

128
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:44,268
lf we appoint freshers,
office will get spoiled.

129
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,395
Youngsters only can
take decision quickly.

130
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:47,733
50 years old man can't
take quick decision.

131
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:49,707
Shall l call everybody
to come for interview?

132
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:53,334
Sir. You read. Then l'll tell.

133
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,473
First one is Sony B.A.

134
00:11:56,582 --> 00:11:57,913
His dad doesn't know to keep name.

135
00:11:57,983 --> 00:12:00,281
His father's name is
Kundumani. Both are not correct.

136
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:03,846
Next is Subramaniyabharathi.

137
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:08,453
l am getting excited hearing
his name. Call him first.

138
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:10,955
Next is lucky...

139
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,330
What is Lucky? lt means Laxminarayanan.

140
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:14,932
He kept lucky shortly.

141
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,867
Your name is Pakkirisamipillai.
Shall l call you Pakki?

142
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:21,663
Lord Muruga! You only
should save this country.

143
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:27,371
A.A.K.Chandran. This boy
impressed me very much.

144
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,548
How do you know that in
the application itself?

145
00:12:29,715 --> 00:12:31,706
Did you see the application heading?

146
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:33,944
Lord Muruga's name. Can we leave him?

147
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:38,722
l'll tell his taste.

148
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:43,453
Your mustache is the plus point for you.

149
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,962
Mustache is my plus
point...? ln his view...

150
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:50,926
He thinks that long
mustache man has pure good.

151
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:55,398
That's correct. Are you mocking me?

152
00:12:56,642 --> 00:12:58,940
He likes youths like you.

153
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:02,178
Everybody likes me. Except me.

154
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:04,910
Why? Put down.

155
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:11,221
What's your name? Chandran.
lt's not enough to him.

156
00:13:11,757 --> 00:13:14,419
Ok. A.A.K. Chandran.
That's too not enough.

157
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:15,423
How can l tell?

158
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:18,290
What is the abbrevation
of A.A.K? Explian that...

159
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,367
You'd tell like this.

160
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,262
Should l tell my name
like this always? Yes.

161
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:26,497
You'd get job. l'll become a mad.

162
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:33,374
Humans should have their
particular characters.

163
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:35,477
Why are you confusing
my brother like this?

164
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:37,241
Naughty girl. You go inside.

165
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:40,644
Wait. l'll come with punishment. So...

166
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:42,448
You'd go to with
formal in the interview.

167
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:44,648
What? With dhoti & shirt? Ok...

168
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:45,950
Go as an lndian.

169
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:47,950
lndian means Nehru dress.

170
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:50,996
lf you go like that, he'll
get good opinion on you.

171
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:53,925
Only one man is wearing Nehru dress now.

172
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:54,925
Will he give me?

173
00:13:56,302 --> 00:14:00,796
Sports certificate? l
am keeping very safely.

174
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,798
Tear & throw it in the dustbin.

175
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:05,909
You'd show that you're
not interested in games.

176
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,707
He thinks that these
games are waste of time.

177
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:12,443
ln your each & every word...

178
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:15,247
You'd say that your dad only told.

179
00:14:15,654 --> 00:14:18,555
Your dad didn't tell anything
to you. Though you'd tell.

180
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:21,382
Your respect will increase double.

181
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:22,788
As you are giving respect to elders.

182
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:26,924
How do you know these? l
am his doctor from 10 years.

183
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:28,227
l am his family doctor.

184
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:30,461
Are you very close? Yes.

185
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:31,660
Why do we need this uncle, then?

186
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:36,264
Why don't you give recommendation to me?

187
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,364
l forgot to tell that.

188
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:42,241
lf anybody goes with
recommendation, he'll send out.

189
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:43,643
For you too...?

190
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,616
He'll say get out please for me.

191
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:47,447
Remember everything. Wait a minute.

192
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:52,689
Won't you leave me?
l want to go urgently.

193
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:54,315
My patient Badhu...

194
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,927
lt's 10 days since l
gave injection to him.

195
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:57,895
l should give injection
to him atleast today.

196
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:01,591
Today is his 10th day
funeral. Did he die?

197
00:15:03,702 --> 00:15:06,671
Where can l get Nehru
dress? Nehru dress?

198
00:15:06,805 --> 00:15:08,636
lt is in Delhi.

199
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,773
Won't you have that type of dress here?

200
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:12,174
We sold his principles.

201
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:13,711
Should we sell his dress too?

202
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:15,577
Do you have cotton shirt & dhothi?

203
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:16,907
This is the election time.

204
00:15:16,982 --> 00:15:18,882
There is a demand. Come after 10 days.

205
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,853
Nagesh sir? He is in the make-up room.

206
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:28,852
l am going to attend
interview to a patriotist man.

207
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:31,555
l want a cotton shirt & dhoti.

208
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:37,261
Called me? Bring my cotton
shirt & dhoti. Ok sir.

209
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:40,536
This film producer
didn't give money to me.

210
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:42,641
l should collect him in this way only.

211
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:44,231
Sir. Mustache is ready.

212
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,944
This is the balance for
acting in this movie.

213
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:49,514
How is it? You acted
without mustache now only.

214
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:50,944
Are you acting another
role with mustache?

215
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:53,484
A role with mustache.

216
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,246
Another role without mustache.

217
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:56,219
Double action.

218
00:15:56,555 --> 00:15:59,285
Will public accept with
and without mustache?

219
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:03,293
Why not? How is it? ls it enough?

220
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:05,488
Don't waste.

221
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:07,690
Wear this too. You'll get job surely.

222
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,198
lt'll be tight to me. That's Nagesh.

223
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:17,298
Mr. Periyasami Devar! You
grew mustache very big.

224
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,304
Sir. l don't like mustache.

225
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:22,945
Don't you like? Shall l ask him to go?

226
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:24,782
ls the interview over?

227
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:26,782
We'll conduct interview
after your mustache grows.

228
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:37,360
Greets sir. Greets. What
will they ask generally?

229
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:40,899
l'll ask you. ln which
year you took birth?

230
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:44,527
ln 1958. Who is the
congress leader in 1958?

231
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,571
That's not me. Then. You can't get job.

232
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:50,904
You can go home. What's
the doll in your shirt?

233
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,811
That's cat, sir. What's
the proud in that?

234
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,375
He wore a dress like an acrobat.

235
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:03,782
Why didn't he wear a lion doll shirt?

236
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:05,379
He'd be ugly at that time too.

237
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:11,924
Greets Subramaniyabharathi.
lf we hear your name...

238
00:17:12,264 --> 00:17:13,959
Children will get patriotism.

239
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:16,457
Do you know to write poems?

240
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:19,968
l don't have that habit.

241
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:25,934
Can't you pronounce properly?
l feel difficult to say.

242
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:27,878
So you can't talk with
proper pronounciation.

243
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:30,440
Ok. l am going to tell one
thing. Can you tell again?

244
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:34,182
A stick in a bunch of
stick, is bended stick.

245
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:38,451
Tell me. No sir. That's risky.

246
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:41,589
You can't talk with
proper pronounciation.

247
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:42,853
But your name is Subramaniyabharathi.

248
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:45,725
You are doing treachery
to him & his country.

249
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:46,796
Change your name first.

250
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:49,866
Short name is Suppi.
Whatever it is? Get out.

251
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:55,797
What did they ask inside?

252
00:17:55,941 --> 00:17:57,533
He is a boss, who doesn't
know to ask questions.

253
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:00,802
They selected a person
already. This is an eyewash.

254
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:06,173
l am very tired. You may ask questions.

255
00:18:06,685 --> 00:18:09,916
Tell me the name of
few colleges in Madras?

256
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:20,357
What're the show timings
in Devibala? 1 ,4,7 & 10...

257
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:24,701
Next question about the price level.

258
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:28,238
What is the price of
wills & scissor cigarette?

259
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:31,466
Wills price is 3 Rs. Scissors
price is 1 Re & 50 paise.

260
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:35,311
You are very clever. You may go.

261
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:36,573
We'll send the appointment
order immediately.

262
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,441
What do you question him?

263
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:43,885
Youths are studying
among lot of problems.

264
00:18:44,022 --> 00:18:48,459
We'd ask this much only. This is better.

265
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:59,732
Greets sir. Get inside. Greets. Come.

266
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:05,837
Take your seat. One second.

267
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:14,214
What is your name?

268
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:20,647
Will you tell your
full name always? Yes.

269
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:23,393
We don't have rights
to shorten our name.

270
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:26,764
Are we great men?

271
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:27,932
People only should shorten our name.

272
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:30,435
lf anybody asks my name...

273
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,367
My native is Ayyampettai...

274
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:35,333
My dad's name is
Ariyudainambi Kaliyaperumal...

275
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,972
My name is Chandran. l'll
tell inculding these 3...

276
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:46,248
You came to interview.
You have long mustache.

277
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:52,486
Mustache will reflect
our soul, heart & all...

278
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:59,761
People may forget them
& not their mustache.

279
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:02,923
lf anybody has a long mustache...

280
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,969
They are very honest...

281
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:07,229
That's my small opinion...

282
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,807
Do you have any interest in sports?

283
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:18,713
lf l get time & my parents
permit me, l'll play.

284
00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:23,551
Do you know about
Blackpearl? l saw white pearl.

285
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:27,720
l mean world famous foot
ball player Blackpearl.

286
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:30,726
World famous...? l
didn't hear about him.

287
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:34,726
We'd spend our time to
recreation in our hardwork...

288
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,934
We'd not give time to recreation...

289
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:39,799
l understood my dad's
wrong principles now only.

290
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:44,774
l leave, sir. Sit. What
else did your dad teach you?

291
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:46,569
He told many things.

292
00:20:46,878 --> 00:20:52,316
My dad told me as lndian
& Tamilian only after that.

293
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:55,019
Have you worn cotton
dress for that only?

294
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,783
lf we look in financial view...

295
00:20:58,056 --> 00:21:01,822
An lndian family will
get food once by my dress.

296
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,919
Ok. You are wearing
small & very tight...

297
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:08,261
lf you wear it in large size...

298
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,527
An lndian family will
get food for 2 times.

299
00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:12,567
Lot of lndians don't have dress too.

300
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:15,205
We'd wear dress for our
honor & not to show richness.

301
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:18,798
Nagesh told like that.
Who is that Nagesh?

302
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:22,907
Didn't you hear about
him? lt's a wonder.

303
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,874
Who is such a great person?

304
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:27,508
He is a great man, who
lived in A.D. 1 765...

305
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:29,450
l read this in his book.

306
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:34,382
You'd need recommendation
to join in this company.

307
00:21:34,526 --> 00:21:36,460
Do you have that? Sir...

308
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:46,635
l don't want this job
with recommendation.

309
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:53,835
Wait man. You are
getting angry like Nehru.

310
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:02,214
You have lot of principles
in this young age.

311
00:22:02,454 --> 00:22:06,356
You are telling answers
without any fear.

312
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:09,723
l like you very much. Take your seat.

313
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:18,734
Don't fear for others.
Nobody is genius than you.

314
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:20,871
Like that nobody is least than you.

315
00:22:21,306 --> 00:22:23,001
So don't under estimate anybody...

316
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,936
My dad taught this to
me. This is my principle.

317
00:22:26,478 --> 00:22:30,938
See. l got excited. Who is your dad?

318
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:37,779
A great man struggled with Gandhi...

319
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:40,619
Did you hear about him? No.

320
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:44,726
He is my dad, then.
Ariyudainambi Kaliyaperumal.

321
00:22:44,796 --> 00:22:48,527
l didn't see that genius.
That's my bad luck.

322
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,658
Sir. That's my luck.

323
00:22:49,801 --> 00:22:51,928
Why? lf you had heard
about him already...

324
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:54,767
l'd have not got this
oppourtunity to tell about him.

325
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:56,500
You have joined in this job.

326
00:22:56,675 --> 00:22:58,939
lf a Vivekandar lives in
every houses like you...

327
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:01,575
Do you know how good
this country will be?

328
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:04,611
You wait outside. l'll
send appointment order.

329
00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:10,214
l am leaving, sir. What's
this? Oh... ls this? Ok.

330
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:15,891
Shall l send appointment
order to this man?

331
00:23:16,695 --> 00:23:21,394
What a question is this?
l've got a future G.M.

332
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:23,767
What's his mark in this interview?

333
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:27,735
Out of 100 his mark is 7 465.

334
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:33,936
l can't. l can't wear
this dress & work there.

335
00:23:34,012 --> 00:23:36,742
l am a modern youngster.

336
00:23:36,948 --> 00:23:38,848
Your monthly salary is Rs. 850 monthly.

337
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:41,715
lf he asks you to come
with underweat, you'd go.

338
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,785
What will happen? Ok...

339
00:23:43,955 --> 00:23:45,820
l'll lose my respect in this society.

340
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:48,951
lf you don't have job,
nobody will respect you.

341
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:53,728
He is talking. You
have a matured sister.

342
00:23:54,032 --> 00:23:56,023
You'd make her marriage.
That's your duty.

343
00:23:56,301 --> 00:23:57,268
Mind that.

344
00:23:57,636 --> 00:24:01,367
My tongue will get spoiled lying a lot.

345
00:24:01,506 --> 00:24:02,871
Nothing wrong in lying.

346
00:24:02,974 --> 00:24:07,308
Valluvar told us already.
We'd maintain that clearly.

347
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:10,572
We can lie to reach a good position.

348
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:13,344
We'd not cheat anybody. That's all.

349
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:15,886
No sir. l am going to resign this job.

350
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:18,547
Don't see my face. Go away.

351
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:26,220
What do you tell? Ok.

352
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:29,562
Come to my way.

353
00:24:34,906 --> 00:24:36,874
Good boy.

354
00:24:42,747 --> 00:24:47,013
Open your mouth. Where
is the thermometer?

355
00:24:47,285 --> 00:24:50,550
Have you swallowed? What's this?

356
00:24:50,922 --> 00:24:54,358
You got above 70 in the last exams.

357
00:24:54,526 --> 00:24:56,653
Your total is not 70 too now.

358
00:24:56,862 --> 00:24:58,352
l can get that much only.

359
00:24:59,064 --> 00:25:00,656
ls this the way to talk to your dad?

360
00:25:00,765 --> 00:25:03,563
lf you want, educate me.
Or you can stop my studies.

361
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:06,227
What happened to you?

362
00:25:06,371 --> 00:25:08,566
lf you provide food
ony if l get good marks.

363
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,464
l don't want food.

364
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:12,939
lf you say that you are
not my dad if l talk so...

365
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:14,836
l don't want dad too.

366
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:18,348
lf you send me out, l don't want house.

367
00:25:19,317 --> 00:25:20,875
What she is telling? Brother.

368
00:25:20,952 --> 00:25:22,510
This problem is in between
you & your daughter.

369
00:25:22,654 --> 00:25:24,383
She is very adamant.

370
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:26,418
You don't want dad, food & house...

371
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,720
What else do you want?
l want to learn music.

372
00:25:28,827 --> 00:25:32,695
l want to learn. Music... l
brought up you showing love...

373
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:34,331
You are very adamant.

374
00:25:34,432 --> 00:25:36,798
l want to learn music.
No. What does it mean?

375
00:25:37,002 --> 00:25:38,731
l will sit on the fan.

376
00:25:39,304 --> 00:25:39,929
lf l say no for that too...

377
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:42,398
l'll sit inside in the
last step of the well.

378
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:44,871
l won't come. lf l
say no for that too...

379
00:25:44,943 --> 00:25:45,807
l'll jump into the water.

380
00:25:45,944 --> 00:25:47,935
What a converstation is this?

381
00:25:48,013 --> 00:25:50,243
She wants to learn music.

382
00:25:50,348 --> 00:25:52,339
Brother accept her wish. Ok.

383
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:56,244
l'll arrange you to learn
music. Promise? Promise.

384
00:25:56,521 --> 00:26:00,252
Put your signature in this mark sheet.

385
00:26:00,592 --> 00:26:04,824
This is original mark
sheet. My marks are above 70.

386
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:07,864
That is duplicate.

387
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:16,840
l told you yesterday only.

388
00:26:16,975 --> 00:26:17,964
Did you prepare the statement so soon?

389
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:22,402
People think the salary is
only for attending the office.

390
00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:25,779
People think to finish their
work in the over time...

391
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:27,746
How are you indifferent?

392
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:31,919
We'd finish our work
within the working hours.

393
00:26:32,223 --> 00:26:34,953
Who finishes his work in
over time, is a lazy man.

394
00:26:35,226 --> 00:26:36,659
My dad used to tell like that often.

395
00:26:36,828 --> 00:26:40,764
You are bad. Why? You
make me to get excited.

396

00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:50,673
We'd enjoy there with music instruments.

399
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:53,742
People should not forget us.

401
00:26:55,814 --> 00:26:58,874
Fool. Which is important?
Office or football match?

402
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:01,885
You have property of your grandpa.

403
00:27:02,253 --> 00:27:04,721
You can sit & eat. But my state...

404
00:27:04,856 --> 00:27:07,723
We can't get permission
from our Manager easily.

405
00:27:08,426 --> 00:27:13,921
ldea. lf l make a call to
all of your office lying...

406
00:27:14,232 --> 00:27:17,759
My grandpa is already sick.
Ok l'll make him serious.

00:27:29,748 --> 00:27:31,807

bathroom yesterday only.

412
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:35,249
My mom has got injured on her head.

00:27:38,757 --> 00:27:41,555

00:28:41,953 --> 00:28:45,889
Tell me. Nothing. Our Mannadi godown...

424
00:28:46,024 --> 00:28:49,824
Our import goods got
spoiled by last week rain.

425
00:28:50,695 --> 00:28:52,856
What do you do now? Before
the lawyer's arrival...

She got big injuries on her head.

Your friend made a

432
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:35,395
Mom? Did he tell about my mom? Yes.

433
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:39,233
l am getting stupor. He's confused me.

434
00:29:39,477 --> 00:29:41,536
He confused me giving this shock news.

435
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,715
l told my mom.

436
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:49,413

Oh mom. lf you pass away, what l can do?

00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:58,019
Muruga. Why are you
testing good people only?

455
00:30:58,489 --> 00:31:02,289
He is very honest. lf

Thiruthani. Be careful.

00:33:10,555 --> 00:33:14,252
She got injured on her
head. But nothing serious.

465
00:33:14,392 --> 00:33:15,825
To which doctor you gave her treatement?

466
00:33:17,895 --> 00:33:19,760
That America doctor?

467
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:21,264
His dispensary is in Aminjikari.

468
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:23,794
What's his telephone number?
l want to talk to him.

469

He doesn't have telephone. no?

He studied for compounder.
But he became a doctor.

00:33:36,814 --> 00:33:40,773
What do you feel to do that refree?

474
00:33:41,552 --> 00:33:44,715
Shouldn't we beat him?
What are you talking, sir?

475
00:33:50,495 --> 00:33:53,760
You played a drama as your
mom slipped & fell down.

476
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:57,401
You had gone to watch
foot ball match. Foot ball?

477
00:33:57,502 --> 00:34:00,630
Foot ball means people
will play by foot... That?

478
00:34:00,905 --> 00:34:04,671
Will anybody go there,
when mom is injured?

479
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:06,866
l'll kill you. You are lying.

480
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:09,372
You are lying to me saying dad.

481
00:34:09,647 --> 00:34:12,616
Yes sir. No sir. What? Yes & No...

482
00:34:12,817 --> 00:34:14,409
l told you that you
are my dad. That's yes.

483
00:34:14,485 --> 00:34:16,783
But you told that l
am lying. That is no.

484
00:34:16,854 --> 00:34:19,322
l saw you through my eyes. Me sir? Yes.

485
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:21,788
You played something through your mouth.

486
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:26,853
People were dancing around you.

487
00:34:26,931 --> 00:34:31,868
You smoked cigerette stylish.

488
00:34:32,003 --> 00:34:33,766
l wanted to beat you there itself.

489
00:34:34,038 --> 00:34:36,598
lf l come there, my respect

490
00:34:36,774 --> 00:34:38,765

491
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,639
l dismissed you from this office.

492
00:34:45,883 --> 00:34:46,747
But one thing, sir.

493
00:34:46,818 --> 00:34:50,948
We'd inquire the matter
& then only we'd decide.

494
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:51,954
Who told that?

495
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:53,948
Haristatal told that.

496
00:34:54,325 --> 00:34:55,792
lf you tell Haristatal's
name, l'll kill you.

497
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:59,761
Did you go to foot ball match
yesterday or not? Tell me.

498
00:34:59,864 --> 00:35:04,164
l am thinking that only.
What & how should l tell?

499
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:07,294
A role with mustache.

500
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:09,804
A role without mustache. Two roles.

501
00:35:11,642 --> 00:35:14,611
Did l wear color pant & shirt?

502
00:35:16,881 --> 00:35:19,406
l understood now.
What do you understand?

503
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:21,915
Was my hair style changed?

504
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,914
Did l smoke cigerette?
You're smoking continusely.

505
00:35:24,989 --> 00:35:26,786
l looked everything through my eyes.

506
00:35:26,991 --> 00:35:28,925
You looked everything, didn't you?

507
00:35:29,727 --> 00:35:31,695
Did you see the mustache?

508
00:35:31,863 --> 00:35:33,387
Did you see?

509
00:35:37,668 --> 00:35:41,832
Did you see mustache?
Think deeply & tell.

510
00:35:42,773 --> 00:35:45,401
You didn't see that. There
is no chance for mustache.

511
00:35:45,576 --> 00:35:47,567
There is no mustache. Because...

512
00:35:47,678 --> 00:35:49,669
You saw my younger brother named lndran.

513
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:55,546
l am Arivudainambi
Kaliyaperumal Chandran.

514
00:35:55,686 --> 00:35:58,382
Sir. He has no mustache.
l have mustache.

515
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:08,463
What are you telling? We are twins.

516
00:36:08,799 --> 00:36:10,562
We took birth with difference
of few seconds only.

517
00:36:10,801 --> 00:36:13,736
Everybody will get confused.

518
00:36:13,905 --> 00:36:16,237
l got caught by you for his mistake.

519
00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:19,568
My dad told me to bear
anything in this world...

520
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:22,373
But don't bear false blames...

521
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:25,681
That Rama suspected
Seetha in the past...

522
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:28,546
You've suspected this Chandran today.

523
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:32,746
l can prove that l am very honest.

524
00:36:33,491 --> 00:36:38,519
ls he your younger brother
truly? Lord Muruga...

525
00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:42,424
l know very well that
you didn't believe me...

526
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:44,762
Should l be alive in
this world beyond this?

527
00:36:44,902 --> 00:36:50,363
No sir. Sir. l am leaving.

528
00:36:52,009 --> 00:36:57,345
Sir. l'll hand over everything to you.

529
00:36:57,715 --> 00:37:01,947
lf any balance is there in
salary, donate to orphanage.

530
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,383
My suicide news will
come in tomorrow's paper.

531
00:37:06,624 --> 00:37:10,720
l'll be that youth. l am leaving sir.

532
00:37:11,829 --> 00:37:14,525
Did you call me? Stop man.

533
00:37:14,966 --> 00:37:17,491
lt happened unknowingly.

534
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:20,898
l got confused because l became old.

535
00:37:21,772 --> 00:37:25,606
You're young. lf l apologize
to you, it's shameful.

536
00:37:25,776 --> 00:37:28,802
l am treating this as your legs...

537
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:31,473
l am apologizing to you.

538
00:37:31,782 --> 00:37:34,444
Shall l leave? Go to your seat.

539
00:37:37,955 --> 00:37:40,890
You suspected this Harichandran. Fool.

540
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:46,794
Save this country from
old age people like me.

541
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:57,264
Come Chandran.

542
00:37:57,875 --> 00:38:00,400
Do you have habit to do exercise?

543
00:38:00,645 --> 00:38:03,671
Yes sir. My dad used to tell often.

544
00:38:03,814 --> 00:38:06,749
Don't make me to get excited
in the morning itself.

545
00:38:06,817 --> 00:38:09,684
l can't bear that. l am
a blood pressure patient.

546
00:38:10,221 --> 00:38:12,781
Blood pressure? Will blood boil simply?

547
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:14,555
lt's boiling with diabetes.

548
00:38:14,825 --> 00:38:16,793
l have sugar too. That's
why l am running regularly.

549
00:38:16,927 --> 00:38:19,487
What a pity? What's your brother doing?

550
00:38:19,664 --> 00:38:20,653
My brother? Who?

551
00:38:20,765 --> 00:38:23,529
That Arivudainambi Kaliyaperumal lndran.

552
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:24,790
That person, who doesn't have mustache.

553
00:38:24,869 --> 00:38:27,895
ls he? He is waste.

554
00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:30,307
What should you do? What sir?

555
00:38:30,508 --> 00:38:32,703
You'd come with him
to my house tomorrow.

556
00:38:34,745 --> 00:38:38,875
With him...? Yes. l'll
change his character.

557
00:38:39,417 --> 00:38:41,715
Why did you stop? Come.

558
00:38:41,886 --> 00:38:44,411
Come to my house with
your brother tomorrow.

559
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:46,854
How can l bring him?
Why? There is a problem.

560
00:38:46,924 --> 00:38:49,449
We won't go outside
together. We can't go too.

561
00:38:49,727 --> 00:38:54,790
We are very different in principles.

562
00:38:54,899 --> 00:38:58,562
Send your brother alone.
l want to meet him.

563
00:38:58,703 --> 00:39:00,796
Shall l leave?

564
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:06,905
Oh no. Oh my God...

565
00:39:10,581 --> 00:39:13,709
ls Nagesh there? Who are
you? He knows me very well.

566
00:39:13,818 --> 00:39:16,343
Does he know you? Very well.
He only told me to come.

567
00:39:16,487 --> 00:39:17,886
He'll come now. Go & sit inside.

568
00:39:50,788 --> 00:39:53,586
What sir? Do you want cinema chance? No.

569
00:39:54,658 --> 00:39:56,785
Are you a producer?

570
00:39:59,864 --> 00:40:02,765
Are you a reporter? No...

571
00:40:03,434 --> 00:40:06,801
Are you a creditor? Do
you want to know about me?

572
00:40:06,871 --> 00:40:11,308
No...

573
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:16,742
lf you don't need my
friendship, it's a loss for you.

574
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:26,715
That is Nagesh.

575
00:40:29,994 --> 00:40:32,724
Have you come early?
You came at correct time.

576
00:40:32,863 --> 00:40:35,855
That's Nagesh. Come boy.

577
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,728
He is my great fan. He is a great actor.

578
00:40:40,037 --> 00:40:42,699
He likes to act in the movie.

579
00:40:42,907 --> 00:40:46,035
But he didn't get chance.
Sit. ln front of you?

580
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:49,811
You'll sit after l leave. Come here.

581
00:40:55,052 --> 00:40:57,748
l'd not understand your
words through telephone.

582
00:40:57,822 --> 00:41:02,850
Did your boss see you directly
in football ground? No.

583
00:41:02,927 --> 00:41:04,588
You know very well about me.

584
00:41:04,662 --> 00:41:06,630
l have a seperate audience & style.

585
00:41:06,697 --> 00:41:09,188
Seperate audience for
me in football match too.

586
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,666
Half of the people looked my activites.

587
00:41:11,735 --> 00:41:14,602
He looked me there. Ok...

588
00:41:14,872 --> 00:41:18,831
How did you make him to
believe as he is your brother?

589
00:41:18,909 --> 00:41:20,877
l followed your way.

590
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:22,779
He looked me part by part.

591
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,314
There is no way to
escape. You told me...

592
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:27,815
Changing mustache is enough
to act in the movie...

593
00:41:28,052 --> 00:41:30,247
l remembered that.

594
00:41:30,387 --> 00:41:31,479
l created a younger brother.

595
00:41:31,555 --> 00:41:32,886
l tackled him telling that
he doesn't have mustache.

596
00:41:32,957 --> 00:41:35,653
Then what man? Then only everything...

597
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:38,317
He told me to send my younger brother.

598
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:40,226
How can l tackle this?

599
00:41:40,364 --> 00:41:43,492
What is the difference
to you & your brother?

600
00:41:43,734 --> 00:41:47,864
l have mustache & he
doesn't have mustache.

601
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:51,808
Remove your mustache.
ls this your property?

602
00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:53,877
lf you give 50 paise,
barberer will remove.

603
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:58,812
Give your hair for your younger brother.

604
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:02,544
You go as younger brother
removing your mustache.

605
00:42:02,753 --> 00:42:04,778
How can l go to office
with mustache as Chandran?

606
00:42:04,889 --> 00:42:08,256
Grow it & go. lt won't
grow within a day.

607
00:42:08,592 --> 00:42:10,526
l'll give duplicate
mustache. Paste it...

608
00:42:10,594 --> 00:42:11,686
Go to office as an elder brother.

609
00:42:11,795 --> 00:42:14,889
Tell me another way
without removing mustache...

610
00:42:14,965 --> 00:42:18,264
A dancer? Are you keeping
your power in mustache?

611
00:42:18,435 --> 00:42:22,963
Tomorrow is a good day.
Tomorrow is Wednesday.

612
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:25,706
Go & remove your mustache.

613
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:29,343
Why are you laughing?

614
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:31,514
l thought how you will
be without mustache...

615
00:42:31,649 --> 00:42:34,379
l laught. Have you
heard our conversation?

616
00:42:34,485 --> 00:42:36,385
What can l do? Shouldn't
l pass the time?

617
00:43:16,493 --> 00:43:26,459
Forgery. Heart is full of Forgery.

618
00:43:37,314 --> 00:43:46,848
Forgery. Heart is full of Forgery.

619
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:55,390
Garderner. Who is that?

620
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:57,760
You only gardaner...

621
00:43:57,835 --> 00:44:00,531
Am l a gardener if l
pour water to plants?

622
00:44:00,771 --> 00:44:03,831
What man? Where is your boss?

623
00:44:04,208 --> 00:44:06,733
Who? Shriramachandramoorthi?
Yes. That old man.

624
00:44:07,611 --> 00:44:10,171
Call that man. l'll call him.

625
00:44:10,781 --> 00:44:12,681
Ok. How is your boss character?

626
00:44:12,883 --> 00:44:13,907
ls he jovial or harsh person?

627
00:44:14,218 --> 00:44:15,185
You are going to meet him.

628
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:17,744
Will he give money for
perfect work or a miser?

629
00:44:18,222 --> 00:44:21,589
You are not looking like
a worker. You're haughty.

630
00:44:21,792 --> 00:44:22,690
Why should l fear?

631
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:24,589
lf l work under him, he'll
pay salary. That's all.

632
00:44:25,029 --> 00:44:27,259
l understood one thing
about your boss. What?

633
00:44:27,398 --> 00:44:29,923
He'll provide food. How
saying? See your belly.

634
00:44:30,467 --> 00:44:32,697
He didn't created
that. lt created itself.

635
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:35,830
Ok. You stay here. l'll
inform about you inside.

636
00:44:35,939 --> 00:44:38,601
Come inside after hearing bell sound.

637
00:44:51,388 --> 00:44:55,347
You removed your
mustache by this old man.

638
00:44:55,659 --> 00:44:57,650
You are not Chandran
now. You are lndran now.

639
00:44:57,761 --> 00:45:00,924
Talk with guts. He can't do anything.

640
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:25,254
Did you get shocked?
No. lt's exciting to me.

641
00:45:25,456 --> 00:45:27,788
Sir. You & your garderner
are looking same.

642
00:45:28,292 --> 00:45:29,589
Are you twins?

643
00:45:29,793 --> 00:45:32,819
What is this, sir?
You are very brilliant.

644
00:45:34,298 --> 00:45:36,960
You called me old man &
thought me as a gardener...

645
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:39,426
l know that you are
trying to apologize to me.

646
00:45:39,636 --> 00:45:40,694
lt's ok. Take your seat.

647
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:46,843
lf a man pour water to
plants with sweating...

648
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:47,968
People will think that
he is the gardener.

649
00:45:48,479 --> 00:45:50,379
You should not do that
job for your richness.

650
00:45:50,447 --> 00:45:51,812
That's your mistake. Why
should l apologize to you?

651
00:45:52,449 --> 00:45:55,850
l told you as an old
man. l can tell now too.

652
00:45:56,019 --> 00:45:56,781
Old man.

653
00:45:59,623 --> 00:46:00,214
That is true.

654
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:07,662
You are very frank.
l like this character.

655
00:46:08,699 --> 00:46:10,792
What is your name? lndran.

656
00:46:11,335 --> 00:46:13,860
But my friends will call shortly lndu.

657
00:46:14,204 --> 00:46:16,832
l don't like these things.

658
00:46:17,374 --> 00:46:19,239
l'll call you lndran.

659
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:22,408
Your wish. Chandran
told that you sing well.

660
00:46:22,646 --> 00:46:24,944
You'd teach music to my
daughter. l've decided.

661
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:29,383
l'll give Rs. 200 salary & l'll
give this to Chandran only.

662
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:30,644
This is my condition.

663
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:33,650
lf you accept this,
you can get job here.

664
00:46:34,424 --> 00:46:35,686
This is called bossism.

665
00:46:38,929 --> 00:46:40,590
l accept this with half mind.

666
00:46:40,864 --> 00:46:43,731
l want to check your tallent.

667
00:46:45,702 --> 00:46:48,535
l had seen a teacher only
tested his students...

668
00:46:48,839 --> 00:46:51,433
Lord Muruga. Why calling
Lord Muruga often?

669
00:46:51,608 --> 00:46:54,270
To save this country only. You too...?

670
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:57,811
Ok. l want to ask a
question to you. Ask me.

671
00:46:58,382 --> 00:47:01,146
lf we mingle Sindhu Bhiravi
raga with Sivaranjani...

672
00:47:01,385 --> 00:47:03,319
lf we catch Attana raga in half angle...

673
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:06,650
Which raga will we get
Kalyani or Kambothi?

674
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:10,920
Garagarapriya?
Shanmugapriya or Sripriya?

675
00:47:11,428 --> 00:47:14,591
Answer me for this. Then
l'll sing a song for you.

676
00:47:15,365 --> 00:47:17,196
You know lot of matters.

677
00:47:18,569 --> 00:47:20,560
l'd have not asked you this.

678
00:47:26,276 --> 00:47:27,641
She is my daugther Sarojini.

679
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:31,614
He is your music master
named lndran. Greets.

680
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:35,484
Telling greets through mouth is enough.

681
00:47:35,652 --> 00:47:39,520
Greets Saro. Call Sarojini.
Ok greets Sarojini.

682
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:42,987
l am going to teach you
with your dad's permission.

Music is like a deep sea.

686
00:47:54,638 --> 00:47:56,799
Nobody can learn easily.

687
00:47:57,507 --> 00:47:58,735
We should have some knowledge.

688
00:47:59,309 --> 00:48:02,403
A beggar too can become
a Managing Director.

689
00:48:03,447 --> 00:48:05,438
But everybody can't sing.

690
00:48:05,682 --> 00:48:07,650

702
00:48:49,626 --> 00:48:51,594

00:49:07,844 --> 00:49:12,577
l've got excited. l knew
about these ragas today only.

708
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:16,342

00:49:17,654 --> 00:49:20,214

You didn't call me.

853
01:02:07,990 --> 01:02:09,651
Before you see my mom...

854
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:11,353
l want to see my mom once. Why?

855
01:02:12,228 --> 01:02:15,391
Give half a day leave to me.

856
01:02:15,631 --> 01:02:18,828
Do you want half a day
leave to see your mom?

857
01:02:18,968 --> 01:02:23,462
Don't l want? She is my mom.

858
01:02:23,806 --> 01:02:26,775
lf l talk about your
brother, won't she mistake me?

859
01:02:27,343 --> 01:02:29,777
How is your mom? Modern or orthodox...?

860
01:02:30,413 --> 01:02:33,871
ls she jovial or reserved?

861
01:02:34,016 --> 01:02:38,009
l can't tell anything.
Why? l should search & find.

862
01:02:38,488 --> 01:02:40,319
What? What...? That only...

863
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:44,325
We can't find out a lady
like my mom in this world.

864
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:46,389
l am going to come tomorrow.

865
01:02:54,871 --> 01:02:58,329
ls everything ready?
Let me have a touch up.

866
01:02:58,508 --> 01:03:00,373
Why do you need touch
up for suicide scene?

867
01:03:00,476 --> 01:03:01,465
My image will get spoiled. Please.

868
01:03:01,677 --> 01:03:03,770
You commit suicide by
losing your image only.

869
01:03:04,213 --> 01:03:06,579
Saw the dialogue? ls
there dialogue after that?

870
01:03:08,417 --> 01:03:12,581
Shall we take? Give Clisarin to him.

871
01:03:17,593 --> 01:03:19,652
Life has lot of problems.

872
01:03:19,829 --> 01:03:23,629
lf everybody decides to
committ suicide in the sea...

873
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,700
Sea will become house full now.

874
01:03:25,868 --> 01:03:29,326
l can't live in this world.
l am going to commit suicide.

875
01:03:29,405 --> 01:03:33,865
No. l'll commit suicide.
No. Who are you to stop me?

876
01:03:34,610 --> 01:03:37,579
Do. What will you do?

877
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:39,910
Keep quiet. What sir?

878
01:03:39,982 --> 01:03:42,280
You made me to laugh
in the serious scene.

879
01:03:42,418 --> 01:03:46,821
Go for another take. What
Nagesh? That is Nagesh.

880
01:03:47,590 --> 01:03:48,955
Sit alone for 10 minutes.

881
01:03:49,292 --> 01:03:50,623
Keep quiet & sit. l want to
take her figure close-up...

882
01:03:50,693 --> 01:03:52,752
Are you going to show
her closely to public?

883
01:03:52,862 --> 01:03:54,261
That's their fate.

884
01:03:54,430 --> 01:03:57,263
Look me. Where is the cigerette?

885
01:03:59,468 --> 01:04:02,369
Did you watch the shooting? How is it?

886
01:04:02,672 --> 01:04:03,570
lt's a headache to me.

887
01:04:03,706 --> 01:04:06,607
lf you watch this into the
theatre, your head will blast.

888
01:04:06,776 --> 01:04:07,970
ls she Y.Vijaya?

889
01:04:08,511 --> 01:04:11,947
Music come, when she tells
the dialogue. Where's it?

890
01:04:12,348 --> 01:04:19,686
That's old. Public will give
sound looking this scene.

891
01:04:19,889 --> 01:04:21,516
What is this?

892
01:04:22,358 --> 01:04:24,519
Leave it. Why should l
need that? l have a problem.

893
01:04:24,594 --> 01:04:26,425
l need a mom now.

894
01:04:26,629 --> 01:04:29,792
They take movie named
Thaaipaasam now. Your fate.

895
01:04:29,966 --> 01:04:33,333
Everybody has gone to
outdoor for shooting.

896
01:04:40,443 --> 01:04:44,641
Sowcarjanaki. She is not Sowcarjanaki.

897
01:04:44,747 --> 01:04:46,840
She looks like her.

898
01:04:47,016 --> 01:04:52,921
But she is different. A
photographer will come with her.

899
01:04:53,022 --> 01:04:57,789
Yes. He is coming.
Hai Laxmi. How are you?

900
01:05:05,635 --> 01:05:09,196
This laugh. lt's many days
since l heard this laugh.

901
01:05:09,405 --> 01:05:12,272
What is that MD? lt
means Meenakshi Duraisami.

902
01:05:12,441 --> 01:05:14,739
She is very famous in cine field.

903
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:19,814
She is a millioniare.

904
01:05:20,883 --> 01:05:26,344
Her hobby is running
drama with 15 girls...

905
01:05:26,522 --> 01:05:29,821
She is the storywriter,
director, dialogue & music.

906
01:05:29,959 --> 01:05:32,359
But we should see her drama.

907
01:05:32,528 --> 01:05:34,621
lf you fail to see the drama...

908
01:05:34,830 --> 01:05:38,857
She'll come & act in your
house. Then only she go.

909
01:05:39,302 --> 01:05:42,396
But she is a hermless lady.

910
01:05:42,505 --> 01:05:45,872
Wait. Vijaya. Are you fine? Fine.

911
01:05:45,975 --> 01:05:50,435
What? No roumers about
you. Did you get married?

912
01:05:50,579 --> 01:05:53,275
Will l get married without
you? That's why l asked.

913
01:05:56,686 --> 01:06:05,492
But if you praise her drama,
she'll do anything for you.

914
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:20,740
Forgery. Heart is full of Forgery.

915
01:06:25,748 --> 01:06:30,378
Forgery. Heart is full of Forgery.

916
01:06:36,025 --> 01:06:45,900
There is no shame. Acting is not wrong.

917
01:06:55,244 --> 01:06:57,769
Why do you give this? We are your fans.

918
01:07:01,650 --> 01:07:04,244
We saw your interview.
l could not sleep...

919
01:07:04,353 --> 01:07:06,514
Such a wonderful performance.

920
01:07:06,622 --> 01:07:11,218
He too told like this in
the morn. Don't you know him?

921
01:07:11,527 --> 01:07:16,191
That is Cho. God created
you to do service for art.

922
01:07:16,298 --> 01:07:18,289
You are the child of Art mother.

923
01:07:18,534 --> 01:07:22,732
Our MGR too told like
this in the last week.

924
01:07:23,372 --> 01:07:26,239
Enough of your praising. This is last.

925
01:07:26,342 --> 01:07:30,506
See. What l am going to
do? Did you get married?

926
01:07:32,448 --> 01:07:36,248
What do you feel about
my age? 20 to 22 years.

927
01:07:37,386 --> 01:07:38,910
l am 45 years old.

928
01:07:39,488 --> 01:07:42,719
45 years? She is like my mom. Yes.

929
01:07:42,825 --> 01:07:45,487
Board has Duraisami name.
ls that your hubby? Yes.

930
01:07:45,628 --> 01:07:46,560
ls he your own husband?

931
01:07:47,863 --> 01:07:52,425
Ok. l want a help.

932
01:07:52,601 --> 01:07:55,661
How can l tell? We like her
drama very much, don't we?

933
01:07:55,738 --> 01:07:59,367
Like that she'll do
anything for us. Ask her.

934
01:07:59,442 --> 01:08:01,342
No. Ask me.

935
01:08:02,611 --> 01:08:06,707
You'd act for me. Did you fear for this?

936
01:08:06,782 --> 01:08:10,843
What role? Mother role. Mother role?

937
01:08:11,487 --> 01:08:14,479
l didn't act in this role until
now. Will public accept this?

938
01:08:14,623 --> 01:08:17,456
Not public. A single person...

939
01:08:17,626 --> 01:08:20,390
lf he accepts, it's
enough. Drama for a person?

940
01:08:20,629 --> 01:08:23,723
Yes. You sit. l'll tell you briefly.
